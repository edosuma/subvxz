WEBVTT

00:06.048 --> 00:07.216
<i>You ready to roll?</i>

00:07.216 --> 00:08.467
This is my second day.

00:08.467 --> 00:09.427
- Uh-huh.
- Still not exactly sure

00:09.427 --> 00:11.971
what it is that
we do here, but...

00:14.890 --> 00:17.476
<i>Uploads live
a life of luxury.</i>

00:17.476 --> 00:19.103
Ingrid uploaded for me.

00:19.103 --> 00:20.521
I'm with someone, too.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.481
Oh. It's all good, brother.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.859
- That was weird.
- So weird.

00:24.859 --> 00:27.153
It's Family Day, and
the new Proto-Tykes are here.

00:28.738 --> 00:31.699
- Oh, what seems to be
the problem?
- You're a moron.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.493
You will become human before
that woman ever does.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.412
Aleesha, you're promoted again.

00:36.412 --> 00:38.038
You ready?

00:38.038 --> 00:41.041
Oh, it's on!

00:41.041 --> 00:42.251
The Ludds hate our kind,

00:42.251 --> 00:44.503
and they're capable of anything.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.130
- What'd you hit?
- Freeyond.

00:46.130 --> 00:48.257
Why pick on Freeyond?
They're the good guys.

00:48.257 --> 00:50.092
<i>Upload for free.</i>

00:50.092 --> 00:51.510
Freeyond's a good idea.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.929
<i>Give the poor people
even a smidgen of</i>

00:53.929 --> 00:55.055
what we enjoy here.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.974
<i>Nathan Brown
isn't a threat.</i>

00:56.974 --> 01:00.102
<i>He has no memories left
to tie me to anything.</i>

01:00.102 --> 01:01.896
My God, it was Choak.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.272
He's the one who had me killed.

01:03.272 --> 01:05.316
They knew you were
working on a free upload.

01:05.316 --> 01:08.068
<i>Choak bought your code,
and that's the guts of Freeyond.</i>

01:08.068 --> 01:10.446
<i>We need to knock out
the whole thing all at once.</i>

01:10.446 --> 01:11.989
- We need allies.
- I mean,

01:11.989 --> 01:13.365
I guess it would be nice
to see your boyfriend again.

01:13.365 --> 01:14.617
Ex.

01:14.617 --> 01:17.411
Oh, no...

01:17.411 --> 01:18.871
Shut up.

01:18.871 --> 01:21.332
<i>Freeyond unlocks
with my retina scan.</i>

01:21.332 --> 01:22.625
We have a way out.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.169
<i>I have been growing your body
back to life.</i>

01:25.169 --> 01:28.297
- Ingrid, you're dead.
- Surprise.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.090
<i>You lied
to him for months,</i>

01:30.090 --> 01:31.300
and made him
out of his mind with guilt.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.511
Goodbye.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.138
Nathan needs to download now

01:36.138 --> 01:39.225
or millions of people's lives
are gonna be in real danger.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.145
<i>Nora, I have enough time
to use my retinas</i>

01:43.145 --> 01:44.438
<i>to break into Freeyond.</i>

01:44.438 --> 01:45.981
<i>Do you remember
what happened to the last guy?</i>

01:45.981 --> 01:48.567
<i>The first download
in human history.</i>

01:50.653 --> 01:51.987
I have to do it.

01:51.987 --> 01:55.908
Three, two, one.

01:55.908 --> 01:58.410
What are you doing in NYC?
You're dead.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.496
Mr. Brown, he's nowhere
in the system.

02:00.496 --> 02:03.791
Restart Nathan
and don't tell anyone.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.960
I've been dreaming about this.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.878
What happens in your dream?

02:26.647 --> 02:28.649
Oh...

02:32.278 --> 02:35.155
Hold on, hold on,
I think I missed a spot.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.700
Mm, points for being thorough.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.161
Um...

02:41.161 --> 02:45.040
Um, uh, are you feeling okay?

02:45.040 --> 02:48.043
I feel great. Never...

02:48.043 --> 02:49.295
Never b...

02:52.131 --> 02:53.924
What the fu...

03:22.995 --> 03:25.247
Toothbrush.

03:26.749 --> 03:28.042
Right.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.461
Hey. New burner.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.881
So, you good?

03:33.881 --> 03:37.343
Yeah, yeah. Just, uh,
enjoying the old body again.

03:37.343 --> 03:39.845
Nice. Were there
not enough mirrors

03:39.845 --> 03:41.805
in Lakeview, pretty boy?

03:43.182 --> 03:44.850
That's weird, I was gonna
call you "dead boy" just then,

03:44.850 --> 03:47.394
but you're alive again,
so maybe, how about,

03:47.394 --> 03:49.730
uh, zombie boy?
Zombie pretty boy.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.067
That's pretty good.
"Oh, I need brains.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.945
Brains. Other people's
girlfriends and brains!"

03:55.945 --> 03:57.655
Okay.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.823
Yeah. So you won't
be around for long.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.533
We just need your retinas
for a couple days,

04:01.533 --> 04:04.119
then you can pop off
back where you came from.

04:04.119 --> 04:08.082
Well, you are legally dead,
so you can't get work.

04:08.082 --> 04:10.709
In fact, yeah, how would you
even support yourself?

04:10.709 --> 04:12.544
Oh, you could just
mooch off Nora.

04:12.544 --> 04:13.921
Like you did with Ingrid.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.173
Isn't that kind of,
like, your thing?

04:16.173 --> 04:19.426
Right, well, I guess
if the hottest woman

04:19.426 --> 04:21.720
I'd ever been with
rejected me for a dead guy,

04:21.720 --> 04:23.931
I'd be a little salty, too.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.057
Thanks for the phone.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.227
Yep.

04:40.572 --> 04:43.117
I was wondering if Nathan
wanted to bird-watch with me.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.910
- Um...
- Where is he? Do you know?

04:44.910 --> 04:49.123
- Mm...
- Why are you here,
alone in Nathan's suite,

04:49.123 --> 04:50.416
wearing his clothes?

04:50.416 --> 04:52.167
Uh...

04:54.378 --> 04:56.505
I'm pregnant.

04:56.505 --> 04:57.923
It's a new thing.

04:57.923 --> 04:59.299
Well, I saw the ads.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.218
Yeah, yeah.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.220
So we're gonna
have a little one.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.597
Mm-hmm. So, may I?

05:05.597 --> 05:08.475
Oh, uh, mm-hmm.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.770
Wow. Remarkable.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.606
Thank you.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.484
Well...

05:21.947 --> 05:23.782
<i>So Choak came by</i>

05:23.782 --> 05:25.743
- wondering where you were.
<i>- Oh, shit.</i>

05:25.743 --> 05:27.494
The Ludds are about to
sneak us into Choak Tower.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.705
We're gonna break into Freeyond
and shut it down.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.040
<i>You didn't
say anything, did you?</i>

05:31.040 --> 05:33.667
Of course not. No.
You think I'm an idiot?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.961
No, I told him I was
pregnant with our child.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.380
<i>Would you ever want
to co-parent with me?</i>

05:38.380 --> 05:40.799
Look, I can't keep
having this conversation.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.551
<i>Yes?</i>

05:42.551 --> 05:44.011
Hey.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.596
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

05:45.596 --> 05:48.223
That's not fair.
I-I don't always only call

05:48.223 --> 05:49.391
when I want something.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.019
<i>Look, I know things have been</i>

05:52.019 --> 05:54.438
<i>weird lately between us,</i>

05:54.438 --> 05:58.650
<i>but can you take
the day off and help me?</i>

05:58.650 --> 06:01.278
And there it is.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.696
<i>I can't do this
with you right now.</i>

06:02.696 --> 06:03.697
<i>With my new lease,</i>

06:03.697 --> 06:05.991
I gotta make it work at work.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.202
- Is this where Ivan is?
- I...

06:08.202 --> 06:10.245
<i>I've been
looking for him all morning.</i>

06:10.245 --> 06:12.790
I... I can't say.

06:12.790 --> 06:14.208
<i>What's it like
having a body again?</i>

06:14.208 --> 06:16.085
It's weird. It's weird.

06:16.085 --> 06:18.045
My fingers are still all wrinkly

06:18.045 --> 06:19.713
from being in the tub so long,

06:19.713 --> 06:22.091
and smells are way too intense.

06:22.091 --> 06:24.802
I don't know
how else to say this,

06:24.802 --> 06:26.512
but I'm farting more.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.972
<i>- Did you tell Nora?</i>
- Why would I tell her that?

06:28.972 --> 06:30.224
I would tell you that.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.142
<i>Yes, I know you would.</i>

06:32.142 --> 06:33.393
So, did you guys hook up?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.895
Was it everything
you thought it would be?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.605
She seems like a bit of
a pillow princess to me.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.567
<i>It'll get better. Maybe.
Who knows, though.</i>

06:42.277 --> 06:43.570
Let's just say we had
an amazing connection.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.239
Yeah, I had one of those once,

06:45.239 --> 06:46.824
but then he downloaded.

06:46.824 --> 06:48.575
<i>Oh, my God,
make a new friend, okay?</i>

06:48.575 --> 06:49.827
<i>I don't know when
I'm coming back.</i>

06:49.827 --> 06:52.246
Fine. Whatever.

06:54.164 --> 06:56.542
So I guess I'll see you
in a few days,

06:56.542 --> 06:59.294
<i>- or weeks, or months.</i>
- Leesh...

06:59.294 --> 07:02.714
Don't. Lucy calls me that.

07:09.096 --> 07:13.016
Well, looks like yours
went as well as mine.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.147
What was that? Are you okay?

07:18.147 --> 07:22.359
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm-I'm hungry for sure.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.653
Oh, well, let's take
your new stomach

07:24.653 --> 07:27.114
- out for a spin, then.
- Yeah, that's great.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.244
Oh, what a gorgeous day.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.663
You're gorgeous.

07:34.663 --> 07:38.000
Oh, you're into me.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.669
- Oh.
- Oh, good.

07:40.669 --> 07:41.670
- One, please.
- Mm-hmm.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.839
With, like, an unholy
amount of onions.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.132
All right, you better
eat them, too.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.177
No, just onion stink for you.

Not a chance.

08:29.635 --> 08:32.054
Could be longer.

08:32.054 --> 08:34.097
Yeah, could be shorter, too.

Huh, it is Nathan Brown.

08:45.651 --> 08:47.611
And not on a screen either.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.821
I have some questions for you.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.783
Can you even get out
of that thing?

08:52.783 --> 08:54.409
Yes, but it's not worth it.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.536
Just talk to me
through the window.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.081
Uh, Detective, are you stuck?

08:59.081 --> 09:00.874
- I am not.
- Mm-hmm.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.709
Please stop.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.879
So you were only pretending
to be in Lakeview.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.882
Thing is, the scan tech
that uploaded you in L.A.

09:08.882 --> 09:09.967
confirmed you died.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.677
You mean was murdered.

09:11.677 --> 09:14.638
Why don't you solve that
instead of worrying about...

09:14.638 --> 09:16.848
The guy in the elevator,
I know that was self-defense.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.433
He's a contract killer.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.560
Who hired him, though?
That's the question.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.981
See, I'm putting it all
together piece by piece.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.775
If you find another,
here's my contact.

09:27.776 --> 09:28.819
Well, you want a hint?

09:28.819 --> 09:30.988
Connect elevator dude
to David Choak.

09:30.988 --> 09:32.489
The Yankees' new shortstop?

09:32.489 --> 09:34.324
The dead billionaire.

09:34.324 --> 09:37.077
Oh. That makes more sense.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.162
Yeah.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.879
I never use these.
I want a refund.

09:47.879 --> 09:51.133
Is that the silk cutout bra
and G-string set,

09:51.133 --> 09:52.592
or the open-gusset boyshort?

09:52.592 --> 09:54.303
You can't tell the difference?

09:54.303 --> 09:56.263
Wow.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.765
Programmed by nerds.

10:00.809 --> 10:05.272
Ah. "Custom sexy fisherwoman's
outfit with assless waders."

10:06.732 --> 10:08.400
I don't see how

10:08.400 --> 10:10.986
these would be water-resistant.

10:10.986 --> 10:14.323
You have no idea what it takes
to keep a relationship spicy.

10:14.323 --> 10:17.326
Not that it made any difference.

10:17.326 --> 10:20.037
He left me tied to a chair.

10:21.455 --> 10:24.458
Oh. Oh, these'll do.

10:24.458 --> 10:27.294
These will do just fine.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.837
- Yes.
- Oh...

11:22.641 --> 11:26.561
Okay, first,
why don't you tell me

11:26.561 --> 11:28.313
a little bit about yourselves,

11:28.313 --> 11:30.732
and why you have the arrogance

11:30.732 --> 11:32.359
to think you can fill
the friendship shoes

11:32.359 --> 11:33.360
of Nathan Brown.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.404
Okay, well, I'll go first.

11:35.404 --> 11:38.407
I... Hello, first of all.

11:38.407 --> 11:42.160
Hi, my name is AI Bartender,
and I am a piece

11:42.160 --> 11:45.163

designed to let you know

11:45.163 --> 11:46.248
what you want to hear.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.959
And what I'm getting
from you is that

11:48.959 --> 11:51.378
we're not Nathan Brown.
Nathan Brown is perfect.

11:51.378 --> 11:55.257
And why-why will we
replace him? We can't.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.134
Because Nathan Brown is perfect.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.428
That's a really good answer.

11:59.428 --> 12:00.429
I know basketball.

12:00.429 --> 12:01.888
Oh, yeah? Best player

12:01.888 --> 12:03.723
in the history of the game,
all of you.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.435
- Michael Jordan.
- Bill Russell.

12:06.435 --> 12:08.520
Nathan, if he tried.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.605
You're gonna sweep
this thing, aren't you?

12:10.605 --> 12:12.941
All right, uh,
how about impressions?

12:12.941 --> 12:15.861
Who can do impressions?

12:15.861 --> 12:16.987
Who do you want us to do?

12:16.987 --> 12:19.281
You know what, surprise me.

12:19.281 --> 12:20.574
No. Nathan.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.616
There it is.

12:21.616 --> 12:22.951
Uh, to be honest,

12:22.951 --> 12:27.122
I didn't really spend
a lot of time with him.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.749
I don't really know
what he was like.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.002
Uh, that won't be
a problem, right?

12:32.002 --> 12:34.254
Of course not.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.797
Access revoked.

12:35.797 --> 12:38.675
Oh-oh. Whoa!

12:40.177 --> 12:41.720
And then there were two.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.140
Eh, fuck it.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.434
Access revoked, access revoked.

12:49.269 --> 12:53.857
Oh, I was a fool to think
I could just replace you, huh?

13:01.781 --> 13:04.284
<i>Rafi Zukor. Approved.</i>

13:08.079 --> 13:10.874
<i>Anna Ruiz. Approved.</i>

13:27.307 --> 13:30.685
- Seriously?
- What?

13:30.685 --> 13:32.896
I was just being polite.

13:36.691 --> 13:40.946
Hey, I don't remember
seeing you two before.

13:40.946 --> 13:43.156
She... Well, uh,

13:43.156 --> 13:46.034
actually, she... I'm...

13:46.034 --> 13:50.121
Her... Me... Well,
it's actually, we're, um...

13:50.121 --> 13:51.831
The story of my life.

13:51.831 --> 13:55.627
Yes, a middle child
of three sisters.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.088
Older sister, cello prodigy.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.590
Younger sister sick
all the time.

14:00.590 --> 14:01.967
We never knew what it was,
but it was bad.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.927
And I was just
doing my homework,

14:03.927 --> 14:06.263
doing my-my chores, and what?

14:06.263 --> 14:08.139
And getting ignored.

14:08.139 --> 14:09.724
And why? Because
I was not playing

14:09.724 --> 14:11.434
at Dave & Buster's
Lincoln Center,

14:11.434 --> 14:13.311
and not in a hospital bed?

14:15.188 --> 14:17.148
Maybe it's just me.
It's just me!

14:17.148 --> 14:20.277
Um, I been here
for three months,

14:20.277 --> 14:23.530
and still, no one sees me.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.950
Mm.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.868
I'm so sorry.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.792
I didn't know any of that.

14:37.043 --> 14:41.089
Wow, you're bad under pressure.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.591
What? I'm great under pressure.

14:42.591 --> 14:44.342
Come on.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.261
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

15:05.113 --> 15:08.491
Oh. Whoa. Whoops. Whoopsies.
Sorry, Mr. Brown.

15:11.536 --> 15:12.996
Mr. Brown.

15:12.996 --> 15:16.166
Yes, hi. What time is
Family Day starting tomorrow?

15:16.166 --> 15:19.794
Family Day is starting
in minus two weeks.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.546
I'm sorry, what?

15:21.546 --> 15:23.548
The exact time until Family Day

15:23.548 --> 15:26.051
is two weeks
and 40 minutes... ago.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.262
Okay. Uh, Angel.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.766
Hi. Oh, wow,

15:32.766 --> 15:34.476
you look great,
if I say so myself.

15:34.476 --> 15:37.771
Thank you. Um, who are you now?

15:37.771 --> 15:39.272
Tinsley.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.984
Oh, the server from
our dinner party last night.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.569
Okay, great, yeah.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.279
Thanks for getting
your own avatar.

15:46.279 --> 15:50.325
Yeah. Yes. Sure.
How do you like it?

15:50.325 --> 15:51.743
Sure, it's fine.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.119
Uh, there's something wrong
with the concierge.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.121
He seems to think that
Family Day already happened,

15:55.121 --> 15:56.956
so I don't know,
you might want to

15:56.956 --> 15:58.917
do something about that before
the visitors start to arrive.

15:58.917 --> 16:02.837
Right. Yes. Nice catch, Nathan.

16:02.837 --> 16:05.090
Sure. Okay.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.009
Uh, call on me whenever.

16:08.009 --> 16:10.970
Oh, my God. Do you like him?

16:22.440 --> 16:23.942
Okay.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.779
Pair.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.880
First person ever.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.175
First person ever!

16:49.175 --> 16:51.344
Whoo!

17:07.861 --> 17:08.903
What are you doing?

17:08.903 --> 17:10.613
Uh, nothing, nothing.

17:10.613 --> 17:13.783
Just...
getting past the firewall.

17:13.783 --> 17:15.994
Open root directory.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.083
Open "Freeyond Code Edit."

17:23.126 --> 17:24.544
Shit.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.087
What?

17:27.088 --> 17:28.715
It's airgapped.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.551
I can't access it remotely,
only through the servers in...

17:34.220 --> 17:36.890
...Elizabeth, New Jersey.

17:40.268 --> 17:43.188
Okay, progress.

17:43.188 --> 17:45.565
Your retinas work,
and now we have the address.

17:45.565 --> 17:49.235
And I've always wanted
to see New Jersey.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.264
<i>Miss Kannerman,
is this a good time?</i>

18:18.264 --> 18:20.391
I answered, didn't I?

18:20.391 --> 18:22.936
<i>Good news. We scraped
the shaft, and it's viable.</i>

18:22.936 --> 18:24.729
I'm sorry, who is calling?

18:24.729 --> 18:27.565
<i>NeckGen, ma'am.
About the hair you brought in.</i>

18:27.565 --> 18:30.902
<i>We were able to get enough
DNA for a whole new clone.</i>

18:30.902 --> 18:33.196
<i>And the accelerated
time table works, too.</i>

18:33.196 --> 18:35.990
Yeah, I'm actually rethinking
this whole investment.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.867
Why should I treat him
like a priority

18:37.867 --> 18:39.786
when he treats me
like an option?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.830
<i>I read that book, too.</i>

18:41.830 --> 18:43.832
- I'm playing myself.
<i>- You're playing yourself.</i>

18:43.832 --> 18:45.792
I have made chasing
after this man

18:45.792 --> 18:47.752
my entire identity.

18:47.752 --> 18:50.213
I don't even
recognize myself anymore.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.841
Well, this stops now. Okay?

18:52.841 --> 18:55.468
Yeah, I am gonna
make myself into someone

18:55.468 --> 18:58.012
that I can love, and then
I will attract love.

18:58.012 --> 18:59.597
The love that I deserve.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.683
<i>Preach.</i>

19:01.683 --> 19:03.643
Oh, shit, can you hold, please?

19:03.643 --> 19:06.271
<i>Hey, babe, where are you?</i>

19:06.271 --> 19:07.856
Where am I?

19:07.856 --> 19:09.649
<i>Yeah. I looked for you
in the room, the dining hall,</i>

19:09.649 --> 19:10.650
<i>the spa.</i>

19:10.650 --> 19:12.402
Wait, you're back in Lakeview?

19:12.402 --> 19:15.905
<i>Uh, yeah.
Where else would we be?</i>

19:15.905 --> 19:19.033
<i>Just hurry home, okay?
I miss you.</i>

19:20.243 --> 19:23.538
Uh...

19:26.916 --> 19:28.710
Hey, can I, um, put you on hold

19:28.710 --> 19:30.128
just a little bit
longer, please?

19:46.311 --> 19:48.521
Wait,
wait, wait, wait.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.024
- We're going in there?
- What's the problem?

19:52.191 --> 19:54.319
Nothing. Nothing.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.201
Oh...

20:05.330 --> 20:07.707
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I know. I'm trying
to find the air freshener.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.167
No, look.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.547
Taken inside
Freeyond headquarters,

20:14.547 --> 20:16.049
Oliver Kannerman
and David Choak.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.717
Also, Rory Shickleman
and Penny Chao.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.970
He's the head of Panera Aeon,
and she runs Cove for Apple.

20:20.970 --> 20:24.390
Wait, isn't that your boss?

20:24.390 --> 20:27.101
Kamyar Whitbridge? Shit.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.604
And that's his boss,
Miro Mansour.

20:29.604 --> 20:31.189
Why is Whitbridge so small?

20:31.189 --> 20:32.440
Maybe he didn't
use an assistant

20:32.440 --> 20:33.942
to set up his hologram.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.110
There's at least four
billionaires in that room,

20:36.110 --> 20:37.654
and they're supposed
to be competitors.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.906
- What'd you do?
- Shit.

20:39.906 --> 20:40.990
I hit "Coastal Tide."
I thought it was a scent.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.367
Apparently it's an ambience.

20:46.537 --> 20:49.123
Oh, God.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.375
Are you kidding me?

20:50.375 --> 20:51.542
I'm normally very good
under pressure, okay?

20:51.542 --> 20:52.877
Just play it cool.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.672
Oh, it's back at
Founder's Grove this year.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.048
Good chance to
play a little golf.

20:57.048 --> 20:59.258
Choak. Something wrong?

20:59.258 --> 21:00.677
I know we have a timetable,

21:00.677 --> 21:02.512
but my gut tells me
we should advance.

21:02.512 --> 21:04.597
I want to see trucks
filled with drives

21:04.597 --> 21:06.724
headed to
the server farm tonight.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.059
Not tomorrow?

21:08.059 --> 21:10.103
Um, that's gonna be...

21:10.103 --> 21:12.814
Whichever branch
can open, should.

21:12.814 --> 21:15.066
Let's burn some heads tonight.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.193
Heads will burn.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.945
Open Miami-Dade.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.571
Open Downtown L.A.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.076
Everybody,
we're starting!

21:25.076 --> 21:26.995
Yes! Ah!

21:26.995 --> 21:29.622
So exciting.
Are you ready, gals?

21:32.375 --> 21:35.420
Hey, I know you.

21:35.420 --> 21:36.462
You gave me that tour.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.715
Hey.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.301
Nathan's mom.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.678
Aww, call me Viv.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.888
Thank you, Viv.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.432
I'm Mauricio.

21:47.432 --> 21:49.809
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.856
<i>Are you ready, New York?!</i>

22:00.111 --> 22:01.988
Socialcare cards
out and ready.

22:03.448 --> 22:05.074
Here you go.

22:05.074 --> 22:07.910
- Good luck.
You're true pioneers.
- Let's do it.

22:07.910 --> 22:10.079
Everyone
look straight ahead.

22:14.917 --> 22:19.005
If you'll excuse me, I have
other business to oversee.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.007
See you all at the next one.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.551
Maybe just an email thread
next time, guys.

22:32.935 --> 22:35.146
Hey, watch it!

22:35.146 --> 22:38.024
Don't leave your brooms
in our conference room.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.908
<i>There's
at least four billionaires</i>

22:46.908 --> 22:50.495
<i>in that room, and they're
supposed to be competitors.</i>

22:50.495 --> 22:52.455
Choak is in bed
with the upload companies,

22:52.455 --> 22:54.874
and they control Freeyond.
This is the proof.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.167
Yeah, or it's a deepfake.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.211
After the video of
Vin Diesel going berserk

22:58.211 --> 22:59.545
at the Columbus Zoo,
no site's going to publish

22:59.545 --> 23:00.838
anonymous footage.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.423
Vin Diesel versus
the three manatees.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.424
Wait, that was fake?

23:03.424 --> 23:05.343
Well, let's give Detective Sato

23:05.343 --> 23:06.511
a little something
to chase down, though.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.596
Nice. Text Sato
most recent recording.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.266
Also, we found the address
of the server farm

23:12.266 --> 23:13.684
where they're keeping
the Freeyond source code.

23:13.684 --> 23:15.812
- With my retinas...
- And my brains.

23:15.812 --> 23:19.148
With my retinas and
both of our brains,

23:19.148 --> 23:21.609
we can get in and finally
crash this fucking thing.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.277
Great. That's great.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.570
But, uh, Ivan,
you can go with Nathan

23:24.570 --> 23:26.322
to the server farm.
Nora, you're with me.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.449
Wait, when did we discuss this?

23:28.449 --> 23:29.700
I'm not going anywhere
without Nathan.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.161
Nora, you're a voice
people listen to, right?

23:32.161 --> 23:33.538
You should come with me
to the retail store

23:33.538 --> 23:34.872
and talk to the people in line.

23:34.872 --> 23:36.207
All Nathan needs is some dope
to watch a door.

23:36.207 --> 23:38.960
- Ivan can do that.
- Cool. I have a use.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.963
Hey, it's fine, okay? Go.

23:41.963 --> 23:43.631
I'm in no hurry to die
a second time.

23:43.631 --> 23:46.926
Good, you know,
'cause after last night,

23:46.926 --> 23:50.388
I've been thinking about...

23:58.187 --> 24:01.315
Schwing!

24:02.859 --> 24:05.361
Oh, don't stop on my account.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.366
Hey, babe.

24:10.366 --> 24:12.451
It's Ingrid.

24:12.451 --> 24:16.080
Yeah, I know, that's why
I called you "babe."

24:16.080 --> 24:18.416
Um...

24:18.416 --> 24:19.876
- Hi, beautiful. Mm!
- Hi. What?

24:19.876 --> 24:21.377
Okay. No, no, no, no, no.

24:21.377 --> 24:22.753
You can't... You can't just...

24:22.753 --> 24:25.089
I don't... No. You...

24:25.089 --> 24:28.342
I... I am going to live alone,
and I'm gonna work on myself.

24:28.342 --> 24:30.595
Okay? And then
I'm gonna get love.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.763
All-all of it.

24:32.763 --> 24:36.184
So... so you take that, buster.

24:36.184 --> 24:39.353
Shh. I get it, okay?

24:39.353 --> 24:42.481
I'm sorry your parents don't
want to be here for Family Day.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.317
That sucks.

24:44.317 --> 24:46.485
But you know what? Screw them.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.988
Okay? You're better
than them anyway.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.782
You can hang with me,
Nevaeh, my mom.

24:51.782 --> 24:54.243
We can be our own little family.

24:56.078 --> 24:58.789
Just one second, please.

24:58.789 --> 25:00.208
Okay.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.464
Yeah, okay, grow the thing.

25:06.464 --> 25:08.507
Put it on my card.

25:08.507 --> 25:12.345
Little longer. Sorry. Thank you.

25:15.389 --> 25:16.933
What was that?

25:16.933 --> 25:18.476
Nothing, Brownie.

25:18.476 --> 25:21.812
Just, um, I just wanted you
to miss me a little.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.066
- Well, I missed you.
- You did?

25:25.066 --> 25:26.275
- Yeah.
- I missed you.

25:26.275 --> 25:28.027
Come here.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.738
- Family Day, babe.
- Yeah, babe.

25:30.738 --> 25:31.822
It's gonna be great.

25:31.822 --> 25:33.991
- It's gonna be soon.
- Mm-hmm.

25:33.991 --> 25:36.661
It'll be in the future.

25:36.661 --> 25:38.537
Oh, you're so cute.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.344
Whoa.

25:53.344 --> 25:55.680
Dude, I just have to get
to a hardwire terminal.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.556
Look, I get it.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.476
You're the nerdy sidekick,
not Jason Bourne.

26:01.477 --> 26:03.020
That's where I come in.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.982
I don't think these
are the right weight.

26:18.869 --> 26:20.121
<i>♪ I'm a fuckin' monster ♪</i>

26:20.121 --> 26:22.039
<i>♪ Fuckin' up some
motherfucker ♪</i>

26:22.039 --> 26:23.541
Ivan.

26:23.541 --> 26:25.376
- Sorry, I'm just...
- Ivan.

26:25.376 --> 26:27.295
- You kind of...
- Ivan.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.726
How many fucking halls
in this place?

27:03.914 --> 27:05.458
Oh, shit, I cut myself.

27:05.458 --> 27:08.002
I don't get it.

27:08.002 --> 27:10.629
They're about to upload
millions of scans,

27:10.629 --> 27:11.839
literally yottabytes of data,

27:11.839 --> 27:14.050
and they have one server.

27:14.050 --> 27:16.177
Yeah, great, nerd.
In English, please.

27:16.177 --> 27:17.845
Dude, you work at Horizen.

27:17.845 --> 27:19.805
It-It's too small, okay?

27:19.805 --> 27:21.849
There's not enough storage
for a new digital afterlife.

27:25.186 --> 27:27.188
Wait a second, what's this?

27:30.316 --> 27:32.777
So, is
being with Nathan

27:32.777 --> 27:33.778
everything you wanted it to be?

27:33.778 --> 27:35.029
- I hope so.
- Yeah. Thanks.

27:35.029 --> 27:36.697
Good. Great.

27:38.449 --> 27:41.035
I mean, obviously, the first
night would be romantic.

27:41.035 --> 27:43.371
- It was.
- Yeah. What about
the second and the third?

27:43.371 --> 27:45.206
- Matteo.
- I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

27:45.206 --> 27:47.750
I-I, I wish you guys the best.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.752
Okay? I wish you the best

27:49.752 --> 27:51.379
with what little time
you have left

27:51.379 --> 27:52.755
before Nathan's head goes...

27:52.755 --> 27:55.174
Unlike me, who still has
all four grandparents,

27:55.174 --> 27:56.425
average age 93.

27:56.425 --> 27:57.802
- Okay, will you shut up?
- Okay, I'm sor...

27:57.802 --> 27:59.637
Ooh, trouble in paradise?

28:11.607 --> 28:12.858
Oh, God.

28:24.829 --> 28:26.497
<i>Thank you for the opportunity</i>

28:26.497 --> 28:29.875
<i>to address the tragedy
that has occurred,</i>

28:29.875 --> 28:34.630
<i>that has touched so many
millions of Americans.</i>

28:34.630 --> 28:37.299
<i>The Ludds have a reputation
for brutality,</i>

28:37.299 --> 28:39.093
<i>but to destroy Freeyond?</i>

28:39.093 --> 28:42.221
<i>Hundreds of servers
with over ten million souls?</i>

28:42.221 --> 28:43.514
<i>Dear God.</i>

28:43.514 --> 28:45.975
Look. Bored Ape's Pulitzer
seal and everything.

28:45.975 --> 28:48.018
<i>We can only ask why.</i>

28:48.018 --> 28:50.146
I don't get it.
This never happened.

28:50.146 --> 28:52.523
- Did they know we were coming?
- No.

28:52.523 --> 28:56.819
Oh, my God. They don't care.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.946
That's why there's
one little server.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.614
They-they don't need
Freeyond to work.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.700
They just need to lose
ten million votes.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.493
Wow.

29:05.619 --> 29:07.538
Look, I know they're
the bad guys and everything,

29:07.538 --> 29:10.291
but can we admit
this is cold as fuck?

29:12.543 --> 29:14.253
Right.

29:14.253 --> 29:17.131
Look, a free upload
would be great, sure.

29:17.131 --> 29:18.632
But this is too good to be true.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.634
I mean, you know what else
you lose when you upload,

29:20.634 --> 29:23.012
besides your body? Your vote.

29:23.012 --> 29:26.098
So what? I'd trade my vote
for a chance at heaven.

29:27.349 --> 29:28.767
What do we do?

29:31.896 --> 29:33.606
Smash shit and run.

29:33.606 --> 29:34.773
No, no.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.360
They want us to break it, right?

29:38.360 --> 29:39.945
So we leave it.

29:39.945 --> 29:41.447
Yeah.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.866
Let's not smash it.

29:43.866 --> 29:45.659
That'll show 'em.

29:45.659 --> 29:47.620
But we send out
their press release...

29:48.746 --> 29:51.165
...right now.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.007
<i>Thank you for the opportunity</i>

30:00.007 --> 30:01.425
<i>to address the tragedy...</i>

30:01.425 --> 30:02.676
Did you see this?

30:03.552 --> 30:04.970
Freeyond has been destroyed.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.181
Oh, well, that was close.

30:07.181 --> 30:09.225
- Let's go.
- Sorry.

30:09.225 --> 30:11.268
Once you sign, we have
to go through with it.

30:12.603 --> 30:14.021
- What?
- Oh.

30:14.021 --> 30:16.190
Darn.

30:16.190 --> 30:17.608
No.

30:18.609 --> 30:21.445
Run. Run!

30:21.445 --> 30:23.155
Hey,
where you going? Stop.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.407
We lost our family farm,

30:25.407 --> 30:26.575
then Oscar Mayer Intel

30:26.575 --> 30:28.786
bought all the land
in the county.

30:28.786 --> 30:30.663
But I can grow anything
I want in Freeyond.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.665
Next three.

30:34.375 --> 30:35.751
It was a nice try. Let me, uh,

30:35.751 --> 30:37.586
show you how it's done.

30:39.088 --> 30:41.715
Friends, comrades...

30:41.715 --> 30:43.050
Shut up and get in
the back of the line.

30:43.050 --> 30:44.260
Yeah, I don't think

30:44.260 --> 30:45.761
these people want to be helped.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.100
- What?
- <i>The opportunity</i>

30:51.100 --> 30:54.103
<i>to address the tragedy
that has occurred,</i>

30:54.103 --> 30:55.688
<i>that has touched
so many millions...</i>

30:55.688 --> 30:58.857
This must be Nathan. Come on.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.701
No.

31:13.038 --> 31:13.956
Socialcare cards.

31:13.956 --> 31:15.165
You know, those were just kids.

31:15.165 --> 31:16.250
Stop this.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.544
Oh, fuck, we have resisters.

31:18.544 --> 31:21.046
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.756
Yeah, you're gonna leave now.

31:22.756 --> 31:26.427
Turn around. Turn around.
Let's go.

31:26.427 --> 31:30.514
Just walk. Great.

31:30.514 --> 31:32.433
Good for you.

31:32.433 --> 31:34.852
These poor people
who scanned for nothing.

31:34.852 --> 31:36.312
We have to save
as many as we can.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.063
We do. And speaking of us,

31:38.063 --> 31:39.607
we make such a good team.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.609
And it just, I don't know,
it just feels right to me,

31:41.609 --> 31:43.861
so I just want you to know
that in a week or so,

31:43.861 --> 31:45.613
after Nathan dies, I am open

31:45.613 --> 31:47.197
to trying this again.

31:47.197 --> 31:48.866
- God, Matteo.
- Yeah?

31:48.866 --> 31:50.534
This is not the time.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.077
- When would be a good time?
- Police!

31:52.077 --> 31:54.121
Stop what you're doing.

31:54.121 --> 31:56.999
Or how about you drop your gun
or I shoot you in the face?

31:56.999 --> 31:58.959
- Put your weapon down.
- Put your weapon down.

31:58.959 --> 32:00.002
Stop, okay, both of you.

32:00.002 --> 32:01.503
You're on the same side.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.214
No, what? Fuck the police.
The police aren't on my side.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.258
Lower your weapon
or I will end you both.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.468
She's willing to die
for the cause,

32:07.468 --> 32:08.469
and so am I, my friend.

32:08.469 --> 32:11.263
Whoa. Matteo. Look, I know him.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.015
He's Sato. Sato's fair.

32:13.015 --> 32:15.559
And, Detective,
Matteo is a friend.

32:15.559 --> 32:17.144
Boyfriend, maybe. It's in play.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.562
No, it is not.

32:21.106 --> 32:24.318
Guys, just lower
the fucking testosterone, okay?

32:24.318 --> 32:25.903
Just put your guns down.

32:25.903 --> 32:27.780
Okay.

32:29.531 --> 32:31.116
Okay.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.496
Okay.

32:42.419 --> 32:45.089
- What is wrong with you?!
- Sorry, Nora.

32:52.513 --> 32:54.598
Oh, please.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.141
Text Nathan.

32:56.141 --> 32:59.353
Cop bad. Don't come. Send.

32:59.353 --> 33:01.939
I'll take that phone, too.

33:07.945 --> 33:09.238
Oh, no.

33:09.238 --> 33:10.322
New destination.

33:15.869 --> 33:19.581
Upload. Upload.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.961
Just hang on, Matteo. I got you.

33:27.589 --> 33:29.383
- Hey, Nora.
- Yeah.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.219
- Upload.
- I know.

33:32.219 --> 33:33.387
- I'm trying. Look, it just...
- Upload.

33:33.387 --> 33:34.763
It takes a moment to warm up.

33:34.763 --> 33:36.432
How could you do that?

33:36.432 --> 33:37.683
I can see why you're upset.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.685
Upset? Fuck you.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.603
Look, I thought you were
one of the good guys.

33:41.603 --> 33:43.772
Yeah, sorry.

33:43.772 --> 33:45.190
I got your video.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.776
And I bet the Choaks
would pay a lot for it.

33:47.776 --> 33:51.238
Especially after I tell them how
I tied up all the loose ends.

33:51.238 --> 33:53.907
So your boyfriend
was right, I guess.

33:53.907 --> 33:56.827
- Friend.
- More than friends.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.830
Come on, faster, please.
We got to go.

33:59.830 --> 34:02.875
<i>Sorry, mate,
there's a speed limit.</i>

34:07.004 --> 34:08.922
Yes.

34:21.518 --> 34:24.646
It's ready. I can scan him.

34:24.646 --> 34:28.108
You can, and I can
scan you after.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.735
But you won't end up anywhere.

34:29.735 --> 34:33.030
I'm just gonna throw
all these drives in the river.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.532
Okay.

34:35.532 --> 34:38.577
Well, still, you can't blame me

34:38.577 --> 34:40.579
for-for doing what I can.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.289
I guess not...

34:46.585 --> 34:49.296
That was so cool.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.552
Just hang on, buddy. Okay?
Just a little longer.

34:55.552 --> 34:58.180
Buddy? Really?

34:59.348 --> 35:00.933
After everything...

35:03.519 --> 35:05.479
...we...

35:08.023 --> 35:10.818
Shit.

35:10.818 --> 35:13.320
Damn it. No.

35:27.501 --> 35:29.211
Oh, let's never
split up ever again.

35:29.211 --> 35:30.212
Yeah, good with me.

35:30.212 --> 35:32.089
Is that Sato's car?

35:32.089 --> 35:34.299
Where's Matteo? My idiot
practically cut his finger off.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.802
Hey.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.971
Look, it's-it's
a long story, but we got to go.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.138
Can you help me with these?
