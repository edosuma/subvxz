00:02.146 --> 00:05.681
<i>It's a pleasure to have you high-school
mock trialers in my courtroom.</i>

00:05.716 --> 00:08.721
<i>And so we begin in the matter
of the state vs. Fontaine.</i>

00:08.755 --> 00:10.726
Good evening.

00:10.761 --> 00:13.063
My name is Ashley Harper,
and I represent the state.

00:13.097 --> 00:15.067
In plain, simple language,

00:15.101 --> 00:18.775
this was an act of violence
motivated by sheer greed.

00:18.810 --> 00:22.248
We will prove that Robert
Fontaine armed himself with

00:22.249 --> 00:25.686
a semiautomatic pistol and entered
Estate Diamonds jewelry store.

00:28.326 --> 00:30.094
- Judge Harper?
- Mom?!

00:32.130 --> 00:33.363
Oh, my God! Mom?!

00:33.398 --> 00:34.933
- Kathleen?
- Oh, my God!

00:35.001 --> 00:36.770
<i>Someone call 911!</i>

00:36.838 --> 00:38.341
Ashley.
Ashley, let me help her.

00:38.376 --> 00:40.376
What's wrong with her?

00:40.411 --> 00:42.813
- What's wrong with her?!
- Kathleen?

00:42.882 --> 00:45.686
- Can you hear me?
- Please, Mr. Thorson, help her!

00:45.720 --> 00:47.357
Kathleen!

00:47.425 --> 00:50.963
Oh, God. No.

00:52.499 --> 00:54.800
Oh, please, no.

00:57.022 --> 00:59.057
<i>N-no, Ma. I want regular.</i>

00:59.125 --> 01:01.595
But... no, you can't
have caffeinated beverages

01:01.663 --> 01:04.602
- this late in the day, Jane.
- Okay, Maura says I can't drink it.

01:04.637 --> 01:06.173
So, can I have an I.V. drip, please?

01:06.241 --> 01:08.976
No, but you can try
one of these instead...

01:09.010 --> 01:11.381
my new espresso brownies.

01:11.416 --> 01:14.553
Business is booming!

01:14.587 --> 01:17.157
Angela, you should really be
offering some healthy snacks.

01:17.225 --> 01:19.493
I do. They just don't sell.

01:19.527 --> 01:22.397
Maura, come on.

01:22.431 --> 01:24.200
Don't be so virtuous.

01:25.234 --> 01:28.304
- Hmm?
- Oh, my.

01:28.372 --> 01:32.310
See? Look,
I sold 45 brownies yesterday.

01:32.344 --> 01:35.147
And I've been averaging
an extra $100 a week.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.250
I'm glad you're saving
for retirement, Ma.

01:39.389 --> 01:43.059
Yeah, me, too.
Excuse me, girls.

01:43.094 --> 01:46.520
- Did you see her face?
- I think she's hiding something.

01:46.966 --> 01:50.938
Hey, Ma.
I want you to meet Mark, my lawyer.

01:50.973 --> 01:53.439
- How do you do?
- Mom.

01:53.473 --> 01:56.575
- You look so familiar.
- Yeah, well, I'm kind of famous.

01:56.610 --> 01:59.984
- Or infamous.
- You've seen my commercials.

02:00.013 --> 02:02.547
"Mark... the shark."

02:04.517 --> 02:05.984
Call me.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.554
Call me.

02:09.588 --> 02:13.358
Call me.
You.

02:13.392 --> 02:16.093
- You're the man.
- Boom. Ladies.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.596
Do not tell me you hired
that man as your lawyer.

02:20.664 --> 02:23.999
Okay, I won't tell you, even
though you seem to know already.

02:24.034 --> 02:25.234
"Shark" is from the
German word "schurke,"

02:25.268 --> 02:29.671
- which means "greedy parasite."
- Hear that? "Parasite."

02:29.705 --> 02:31.373
Why didn't you go with Frost's lawyer?!

02:31.440 --> 02:33.274
He's an expert at
personal-injury claims.

02:33.309 --> 02:35.508
Mark says there's too many
people suing the Storrow Center.

02:35.543 --> 02:38.242
Can you believe even
people who weren't squished

02:38.277 --> 02:41.178
- in that garage want money?
- Okay, well, thank God you and T.J.

02:41.213 --> 02:43.381
and Detective Frost
weren't squished.

02:43.416 --> 02:46.417
Yeah. I got to go tell Lydia
Mark's about to get me a settlement.

02:46.452 --> 02:49.052
- You two together?
- No, but we will be

02:49.086 --> 02:51.454
once she knows I can
support her and T.J.

02:54.658 --> 02:56.760
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

02:56.795 --> 02:58.463
Judge Harper just
died in the courthouse.

02:58.497 --> 03:03.834
Oh, no!
I-I've testified in front of her.

03:03.902 --> 03:06.306
- You knew her?
- Yeah.

03:07.374 --> 03:08.707
She was one of the good guys.

03:13.446 --> 03:14.780
<i>Judge Harper's courtroom
was on the second floor.</i>

03:14.848 --> 03:17.648
- What was she doing up here?
- She was a mock-trial advisor.

03:17.683 --> 03:19.317
Well, that explains
all the kids in suits.

03:19.351 --> 03:22.222
I did mock trial.
I always wanted to be the bad guy,

03:22.257 --> 03:26.460
- but they made me the prosecutor.
- That's very impressive.

03:27.464 --> 03:29.565
It's highly competitive.

03:31.403 --> 03:33.271
I never made the team.

03:33.608 --> 03:37.944
- That's not possible.
- The advisor said I was... "wordy."

03:37.979 --> 03:39.281
You?

03:40.183 --> 03:41.783
<i>I knew her husband.</i>

03:41.817 --> 03:43.616
He was a brilliant defense attorney.

03:43.651 --> 03:45.618
Died a few years ago. Makes
this all the more tragic.

03:46.886 --> 03:49.655
<i>Oh, God. Don't tell
me that's her daughter.</i>

03:49.689 --> 03:50.921
Afraid it is.

03:50.956 --> 03:53.557
Oh, no! Was she here
when her mother collapsed?

03:53.625 --> 03:55.326
Yeah.
How did you know she collapsed?

03:55.361 --> 03:57.461
Subdermal bleeding on both knees.

03:57.495 --> 04:00.730
- Okay, what do we have?
- She adjourned her own courtroom at 5:00,

04:00.765 --> 04:04.469
and she checked in students
when they arrived here at 5:10.

04:04.503 --> 04:07.336
Left at 5:25, didn't come back
until after the competition started.

04:07.370 --> 04:09.539
- Where did she go?
- Nobody knows.

04:09.573 --> 04:12.175
- But she left her briefcase here.
- Okay, let's have CSRU collect that.

04:12.209 --> 04:15.209
- We'll go through it later.
- She has a broken rib.

04:15.243 --> 04:16.676
- Did someone give her CPR?
- Yeah.

04:16.711 --> 04:18.413
Uh, Roger Thorson, the
other mock-trial advisor.

04:18.481 --> 04:20.949
From what he said, it sounds
like she went into convulsions.

04:21.017 --> 04:23.685
Convulsions...
So if it was a seizure,

04:23.719 --> 04:25.319
are we looking at natural causes?

04:25.353 --> 04:27.190
Well, convulsions are
a neurological response

04:27.257 --> 04:31.494
to many stimuli... physiological,
pharmacological, idiopathic.

04:31.528 --> 04:32.495
So, maybe?

04:33.932 --> 04:36.702
- Hey. Frankie's been assigned to this?
- Yeah, I asked for more help

04:36.769 --> 04:38.470
till we can rule out homicide.

04:38.504 --> 04:39.738
I'm gonna go finish interviewing
Roger and the daughter.

04:39.772 --> 04:41.940
- Okay.
- Hmm.

04:41.975 --> 04:43.776
There's a wet, tacky
substance on her palm.

04:43.810 --> 04:47.411
- Appears to be paint.
- It's institutional beige.

04:47.445 --> 04:50.550
I'd describe it as more
of a taupe or a sand color,

04:50.584 --> 04:54.921
perhaps even a muted coral
with a hint of abalone shell.

04:56.759 --> 04:58.895
- Am I being wordy?
- A little.

05:23.859 --> 05:26.896
- Hey. What do you need?
- Um...

05:26.930 --> 05:28.865
there's paint on the victim's hand.

05:28.899 --> 05:31.067
Can you find out which area of the
courthouse was being painted today?

05:31.102 --> 05:33.971
- Any idea where to start?
- Wherever she was coming from.

05:34.005 --> 05:37.908
- Well, let's split up. I'll look, too.
- All right. Thanks.

05:39.043 --> 05:41.645
<i>Be right back.</i>

05:41.679 --> 05:44.711
Roger's telling me that he and
Judge Harper are old friends.

05:44.746 --> 05:46.480
- They went to law school together.
- Yeah, we had lunch today

05:46.514 --> 05:49.715
to prepare for the competition.

05:50.486 --> 05:52.232
I can't believe she's gone.

05:54.088 --> 05:55.953
Ashley...

05:55.988 --> 05:58.658
did your mom have any medical
conditions that you know about?

05:58.692 --> 06:01.825
No. My mom was really healthy.

06:01.859 --> 06:03.826
Do you know why she
wasn't in the courtroom

06:03.861 --> 06:05.528
when you started the competition?

06:05.595 --> 06:09.732
- No.
- I didn't even see her leave.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.769
I asked Judge Manning if we
could wait for her, but he...

06:14.803 --> 06:18.438
he said he'd take away points
if I didn't start.

06:18.472 --> 06:19.905
<i>It's okay.</i>

06:19.940 --> 06:22.939
Is there, uh, someone
that can take care of her?

06:22.973 --> 06:25.642
There's her grandma
that lives with them.

06:25.710 --> 06:29.412
- I'll take her home.
- Come on, sweetie.

06:33.986 --> 06:36.421
It's Frost.

06:36.456 --> 06:37.823
Hey, Frost. Put you on speaker.

06:37.858 --> 06:39.058
Frankie found what looks
like a left palm print

06:39.126 --> 06:42.093
<i>on the Northeast stairwell
between the second and third floors.</i>

06:42.128 --> 06:44.865
That's the stairwell
closest to this courtroom.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.834
- Anything else?
<i>- Her purse is on the landing. </i>

06:46.868 --> 06:49.571
Can you show me?

06:49.605 --> 06:51.073
- Where's her wallet?
<i>- Right here.</i>

06:51.108 --> 06:53.445
<i>Full of cash and credit cards.</i>

06:53.479 --> 06:54.780
- So it wasn't robbery.
- Hmm.

06:54.847 --> 06:57.780
Sergeant Korsak, do you
have your magnifying glass?

06:58.483 --> 06:59.984
Thank you.

07:00.018 --> 07:01.852
What is it?

07:01.886 --> 07:05.186
I was examining her neck.
And I noticed blood.

07:05.253 --> 07:08.588
There's a tiny puncture wound
at the base of the skull.

07:08.623 --> 07:10.057
Could be from a hypodermic needle.

07:10.091 --> 07:12.826
- Someone injected her?
- Look at this.

07:12.861 --> 07:15.862
- Appears to be a scratch.
- Yeah. From a hypodermic needle.

07:16.496 --> 07:19.731
So she fought off
someone in the stairwell

07:19.765 --> 07:22.982
who managed to kill her anyway.

07:30.546 --> 07:33.883
I need to know what was in the
syringe that killed her, Maura.

07:33.884 --> 07:35.960
And I can't tell you.
You know how this works.

07:35.961 --> 07:38.411
How is it that we can put a
Rover on Mars, but the damn crime

07:38.412 --> 07:40.861
lab can't find a toxin unless
we tell them what to look for?

07:40.896 --> 07:44.297
NASA lost control of that Rover.
And science is hard.

07:44.332 --> 07:46.033
You know, they can't test for
everything. I need to narrow it down.

07:46.101 --> 07:48.037
There are hundreds
of thousands of drugs.

07:48.105 --> 07:51.806
- Yes, I know.
- Well, whatever was in that syringe

07:51.840 --> 07:53.810
<i>sent her into convulsions,
so that should narrow it down.</i>

07:53.844 --> 07:55.647
Are you questioning my process?

07:55.681 --> 07:57.083
No.

07:57.117 --> 07:58.649
Yes.

07:58.716 --> 08:00.252
Okay, we don't know what
caused the convulsions.

08:00.286 --> 08:03.123
It could be anything from drugs
to household cleaning products,

08:03.157 --> 08:06.228
- pesticides, a chemical.
- Okay, okay. I'm not questioning.

08:06.262 --> 08:09.064
<i>You'll figure it out.
Did you do the nail scrapings yet?</i>

08:09.132 --> 08:11.202
Yes. Nothing under the fingernails.

08:11.236 --> 08:13.405
But this scratch on her hand is from

08:13.406 --> 08:15.574
the same gauge needle as the injection.

08:15.609 --> 08:18.546
- And she has well-developed gastrocnemii.
- Calf muscles?

08:18.581 --> 08:20.684
- How did you know?
- Well, you pointed,

08:20.718 --> 08:22.354
and she has the legs of a runner.

08:22.388 --> 08:25.988
Yeah, she has an old injury...
fracture of the left patella.

08:26.023 --> 08:28.192
<i>- See the pins?
- Yeah.</i>

08:28.226 --> 08:29.661
What does that tell us?

08:29.695 --> 08:31.998
I don't know yet.

08:32.032 --> 08:33.900
<i>You know she put her
husband through law school</i>

08:33.934 --> 08:37.707
- when she was a paralegal?
- Yeah, she was an extraordinary woman.

08:37.743 --> 08:41.844
And now her kid is an
orphan. This makes me sick.

08:41.878 --> 08:45.334
- We'll get it, Jane.
- I hope so.

08:46.483 --> 08:51.025
- It's just not right.
- It's never right.

08:51.459 --> 08:55.030
<i>She's got 10 or 15 cases
on her docket every day.</i>

08:55.064 --> 08:56.966
<i>Drugs, guns, murder.</i>

08:57.033 --> 08:59.267
That's your average day
for a felony-trial judge.

08:59.301 --> 09:01.669
- Did you go through her briefcase?
- Yeah.

09:01.703 --> 09:05.006
Mainly research, case law, notes.
She was well-organized.

09:05.073 --> 09:07.709
This one's marked
"extensions," but it's empty.

09:07.743 --> 09:10.076
Maybe she was reviewing
extended sentences.

09:10.111 --> 09:12.844
She leaves her chambers
on the second floor

09:12.878 --> 09:15.915
<i>and arrives on the sixth floor
at 5:10, talks to her students,</i>

09:15.949 --> 09:17.747
<i>then leaves the courtroom at 5:25,</i>

09:17.781 --> 09:21.083
but stumbles back in
and dies at 5:36.

09:21.151 --> 09:22.419
Wait, how do you know it was 5:36.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.321
The kid who played the court
clerk hit the time clock

09:24.356 --> 09:27.092
<i>- when Ashley stopped her opening statement.
- Okay, so, we found her stuff</i>

09:27.093 --> 09:29.828
in the stairwell, which says to me
she was going back to her office.

09:29.862 --> 09:32.932
<i>She was a runner.
So how long would it take her to run</i>

09:32.967 --> 09:34.869
down and back up four flights of stairs?

09:37.807 --> 09:40.275
- Frost?
- Okay.

09:41.177 --> 09:43.680
<i>Well, this might be something.</i>

09:43.714 --> 09:46.951
She was assigned a high-profile
prescription-drug case.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.254
- The defendant was a prominent Doctor.
- What, he was selling drugs?

09:49.322 --> 09:52.257
Yeah. To the two-six gang.
But his attorney filed

09:52.291 --> 09:53.959
a substitution-of-judge
motion today.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.964
So the Doctor didn't want
Judge Harper to hear his case.

09:55.998 --> 09:57.364
Well, why would he?

09:57.399 --> 09:59.431
She was tough on professionals
who commit crimes.

09:59.465 --> 10:02.001
- Yeah. And she refused to recuse herself.
- So maybe the Doctor thought

10:02.035 --> 10:04.206
the only way to get Judge Harper
off the case was to kill her.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.208
A Doctor could cook
up a lethal injection.

10:06.243 --> 10:07.308
Yeah.

10:08.342 --> 10:10.210
45 seconds.

10:10.244 --> 10:12.812
- For what?
- To run up four flights of stairs.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.748
Above and beyond the
call of duty, Detective.

10:17.019 --> 10:20.091
So why was the judge
gone for 11 minutes?

10:20.125 --> 10:22.293
Did she stop and talk to
someone in the stairwell?

10:22.327 --> 10:24.846
- Maybe she knew her killer.
-  That would explain why the only

10:24.847 --> 10:27.365
defensive wound is the scratch
with the needle on her hand.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.366
She reacted too late,
after she'd been injected.

10:29.401 --> 10:31.768
Where are we on those security cameras?

10:31.802 --> 10:34.102
- The whole building's covered except the stairwells.
- All right. Go through it all.

10:34.136 --> 10:36.446
We need an exact list of every person
that was in the courthouse today.

10:36.472 --> 10:38.508
- I'll help you.
- Thanks, Frankie.

10:38.542 --> 10:40.443
Jane, did you hear what Tommy did?

10:40.510 --> 10:44.011
- Does it involve a shark?
- Yeah. What an idiot.

10:44.045 --> 10:45.479
<i>Frost, maybe you can talk to him.</i>

10:45.514 --> 10:47.315
I tried. He called me after
he saw "Mark the shark's" ad.

10:47.350 --> 10:49.917
If he'd just chill, he'd
eventually get six figures,

10:49.952 --> 10:52.483
- at least that's what my guy says.
- Sounds about right for having to be trapped

10:52.551 --> 10:54.484
inside a collapsed
building for eight hours.

10:54.518 --> 10:57.154
- You guys could have died.
- I still have residual pain in my wrist.

10:57.188 --> 10:59.354
- And Tommy had a head injury.
- Yeah.

10:59.388 --> 11:03.892
<i>That's, uh, Judge Harper's law clerk.
I had her come in.</i>

11:03.926 --> 11:07.826
- I see why. She's hot.
- Hmm.

11:07.894 --> 11:10.828
It's part of the investigation.

11:10.862 --> 11:11.996
<i>And she's too smart for you, anyway.</i>

11:12.030 --> 11:14.802
You have me confused with my brother.

11:14.869 --> 11:18.406
- Let me do the interview with you.
- No. You heard Jane.

11:18.441 --> 11:20.175
<i>I want you to go through all the
security footage from the courthouse,</i>

11:20.210 --> 11:22.779
make a list of all the people
that entered and exited.

11:22.814 --> 11:25.314
<i>Check the court dockets, too.</i>

11:27.348 --> 11:29.184
Come on, Frost.

11:29.218 --> 11:31.421
I'm gonna try to find
where the Doctor was

11:31.489 --> 11:33.489
when Judge Harper was being attacked.

11:34.822 --> 11:38.158
<i>We noticed she had an
S.O.J. motion on her docket.</i>

11:38.193 --> 11:40.329
Did she pass on the legal sufficiency,

11:40.363 --> 11:42.930
or did she assign the
recusal to another Judge?

11:42.998 --> 11:45.998
- How do you know all that? Are you a lawyer?
- No, but he played one in high school.

11:46.032 --> 11:47.433
Oh, you did mock trial.

11:48.503 --> 11:52.372
Me, too.
Judge Harper didn't recuse herself,

11:52.406 --> 11:55.342
so the Doctor had to go before
another judge for a final ruling.

11:55.376 --> 11:58.178
- That motion was denied late this afternoon.
- Like I said,

11:58.213 --> 12:00.913
killing Judge Harper's a way
to get your case reassigned.

12:00.947 --> 12:03.548
I can't believe anyone
would want to kill her.

12:03.583 --> 12:07.421
That Doctor was the exception.
There were plenty of defendants

12:07.489 --> 12:09.323
that wanted to be
assigned to her courtroom.

12:10.324 --> 12:12.860
- Why is that?
- She believed in rehabilitation

12:12.894 --> 12:15.430
and tried to assign
defendants to prison programs

12:15.464 --> 12:17.430
that could help them
turn their lives around.

12:17.465 --> 12:19.298
<i>Any attorneys or defendants
on her other cases</i>

12:19.365 --> 12:22.332
- that were squawking about her?
- Just the routine stuff.

12:22.366 --> 12:25.836
- Any grievances filed against her?
- You'd have to check with the CJC.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.904
- Commission on judicial conduct.
- Thank you, counselor.

12:31.139 --> 12:34.040
When's the last time
you saw Judge Harper?

12:34.075 --> 12:37.591
Right before 5:30.
She ran back into her office to grab

12:37.592 --> 12:39.009
- something she'd forgotten.
- What was it?

12:39.043 --> 12:40.512
I didn't ask.

12:40.580 --> 12:42.246
She was rushing to get back
to her daughter's competition.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.612
- When did you leave the courthouse?
- Around 5:30.

12:46.515 --> 12:50.252
Oh, come on. I loved my boss.

12:50.287 --> 12:53.089
She was one of the few
judges that made it possible

12:53.123 --> 12:55.223
for women to advance in law.

12:56.659 --> 12:59.995
Did Judge Harper ever take the stairs?

13:00.030 --> 13:02.864
Always.
She was a fitness nut.

13:02.899 --> 13:03.999
Any health problems you know of?

13:05.433 --> 13:08.969
Being a Judge is stressful.

13:11.206 --> 13:15.343
Sometimes she'd complain
of dizziness, fatigue.

13:15.377 --> 13:18.112
A few times, she...

13:19.080 --> 13:22.315
Tell us what you know, Ms. Barlow.

13:22.349 --> 13:24.384
This is how you can help her.

13:26.386 --> 13:31.460
A few times, it... seemed like
she was slurring her speech.

13:31.494 --> 13:32.527
Like she'd been drinking?

13:32.561 --> 13:35.027
Yes.

13:47.166 --> 13:50.872
So you dissected the Judge's liver.

13:50.906 --> 13:52.573
You're sure she wasn't a drinker?

13:52.641 --> 13:56.481
Uh, yes. Her liver was near perfect.
No sign of alcohol abuse.

13:56.516 --> 13:58.949
You ordered the Satan special?

13:58.983 --> 14:01.883
"Seitan." It's a wheat protein
used as a meat substitute.

14:01.917 --> 14:05.654
Okay, I get it. It's...
it's theme night.

14:05.689 --> 14:07.859
- What?
- We're investigating a mock trial.

14:07.893 --> 14:11.163
- You ordered mock meat.
- It is very nutritious.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.868
They dissolve the starch
to an insoluble gluten

14:13.902 --> 14:17.006
- and then cook this elastic mass.
- Can't wait to dig in.

14:17.041 --> 14:19.541
Oh, uh, the extended
panel results came back.

14:19.575 --> 14:21.943
- What? Why didn't you tell me?
- 'Cause you were busy

14:21.978 --> 14:24.816
accusing me of ordering you
food from the underworld.

14:24.850 --> 14:27.921
I love seitan.
Okay, tell me.

14:27.955 --> 14:29.892
She tested positive for the
presence of amphetamines.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.063
- Judge Harper?
- Yeah. It could be a false-positive.

14:32.131 --> 14:34.700
Many drugs share similar metabolites,

14:34.734 --> 14:37.835
but I will have to test every one
with a similar chemical makeup.

14:37.869 --> 14:40.540
- Again with the testing.
- You know, you could be

14:40.575 --> 14:42.945
one of the most impatient
human beings I know.

14:42.980 --> 14:45.181
But you're not sure?
Maybe you should test it.

14:45.215 --> 14:48.459
- You're wrecking my appetite.
- No! Maybe that's the insoluble

14:48.494 --> 14:50.857
gluten mass that you ordered?

14:53.593 --> 14:55.597
Got your mail.

14:55.631 --> 14:59.065
Oh, thanks, Tommy.
Do you mind putting it on the desk?

14:59.099 --> 15:03.105
- What's in the bag?
- Oh, cans and bottles for recycling.

15:03.139 --> 15:05.477
Garbage bags are breeding grounds

15:05.511 --> 15:07.479
for bacterial and fungal pathogens,

15:07.514 --> 15:11.117
<i>including salmonella, e.Coli 0157,</i>

15:11.151 --> 15:13.721
<i>shigella dysentery, legionella,
listeria monocytogenes...</i>

15:13.755 --> 15:15.957
She's not gonna stop talking
unless you take outside.

15:16.025 --> 15:18.092
- Aeromonas hydrophila...
- Well, I never got sick.

15:18.127 --> 15:19.628
There's 20 bucks worth of
cans and bottles in there.

15:19.696 --> 15:21.929
Look at her. Her
head's about to explode.

15:21.963 --> 15:25.668
- Staphylococci aureus.
- Look, Maura. See?

15:25.736 --> 15:28.705
Cool, Jane.
Is Ma back yet?

15:28.740 --> 15:30.207
No. Cavanaugh took her out to dinner.

15:30.275 --> 15:33.780
- Tommy, would you like some food?
- Uh...

15:33.814 --> 15:35.980
Yeah, I-I don't eat... that.

15:38.247 --> 15:41.119
All right, well, since you're here,
can we talk about your lawsuit?

15:41.153 --> 15:43.689
No. We can't.
It's my life, Jane.

15:43.723 --> 15:45.858
I know it's your l...

15:45.892 --> 15:47.895
- what about T.J.?
- What about him?

15:47.929 --> 15:50.164
Look, Mark says he can
get me the money now.

15:50.232 --> 15:53.199
Frost's guy says it's gonna
be at least another year.

15:53.233 --> 15:55.169
- I need it now.
- I think it's shortsighted and stupid.

15:57.639 --> 15:59.909
You can't see me as anything other

15:59.943 --> 16:03.112
- than a stupid screw-up, can you?
- What? Tommy, come on!

16:03.146 --> 16:05.845
- Tommy!
- Tommy, stay and have some tea.

16:05.879 --> 16:08.245
No, I just came by to drop off
the cans and bottles for Ma.

16:08.313 --> 16:11.080
- W-why are you bringing garbage to Ma?
- Because she needs my help,

16:11.115 --> 16:14.984
and she doesn't see me
as a screw-up. That's why.

16:19.558 --> 16:23.693
I really shouldn't be that hard on him.
He has such a big heart.

16:23.728 --> 16:26.761
And you aren't listening.
You're going through your mail.

16:26.796 --> 16:29.630
Oh. Um, I just like
sorting and organizing.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.199
I know.

16:31.233 --> 16:34.336
What?

16:34.370 --> 16:36.671
It's from the I.R.S.
I think it's an audit.

16:36.705 --> 16:40.104
What are you worried about?
You break out into hives if you lie.

16:40.138 --> 16:42.841
I mean, if you cheat on your taxes,
you're probably gonna get leprosy.

16:42.876 --> 16:45.077
It's not for me.
It's for your mother.

16:45.111 --> 16:47.091
What?

16:47.983 --> 16:52.287
What are you doing?
Mail tampering is a crime.

16:59.791 --> 17:04.665
Oh, my God.
She owes $27,000 in back taxes.

17:04.698 --> 17:06.963
What? How is that possible?

17:06.998 --> 17:10.865
- She doesn't even make that in a year.
- My father.

17:10.898 --> 17:13.635
He probably cheated on their taxes.

17:13.670 --> 17:16.172
No wonder she's been
trying to make extra money.

17:16.205 --> 17:17.940
Tommy probably knows.

17:17.973 --> 17:19.340
That's why he's recycling
bottles and cans for her.

17:19.409 --> 17:22.012
Well, why does she tell
Tommy and not me and Frankie?

17:22.046 --> 17:24.146
What?
What is that face? What?

17:24.181 --> 17:26.248
Tommy doesn't judge.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.623
So, while you two were
with the hot law clerk,

17:32.657 --> 17:35.254
we were going through 4 million
hours of security footage.

17:35.289 --> 17:36.755
Frankie, cue up the show.

17:36.789 --> 17:42.326
<i>We found Dr. Simmons,
A.K.A. Dr. Oxycontin, coming and going.</i>

17:42.361 --> 17:44.094
Well, that's him and his attorney

17:44.128 --> 17:49.630
entering the courthouse
yesterday at 9:05 A.M. And...

17:49.664 --> 17:52.900
<i>That's Dr. Simmons and the same
attorney leaving at 5:02 P.M.</i>

17:52.935 --> 17:55.668
Right after their motion for
a new Judge was denied.

17:55.702 --> 17:58.707
Yep. And Judge Harper was ambushed
in the stairwell around 5:30,

17:58.741 --> 18:01.875
so the Doctor didn't do it,
unless he paid someone to do it for him.

18:01.910 --> 18:04.461
Maybe we run a list of everyone
at the courthouse against anyone

18:04.462 --> 18:07.012
with ties to the two-six gang
that Dr. Simmons was selling to.

18:07.047 --> 18:08.881
- That's who he'd hire, right?
- Makes sense.

18:08.948 --> 18:10.649
I'll be right there.

18:12.285 --> 18:17.921
- What do you want to do about Ma?
- Nothing. Maura's right.

18:17.956 --> 18:20.325
We do judge.
And Ma doesn't want us to know.

18:20.359 --> 18:21.928
You shouldn't have opened up her mail.

18:21.962 --> 18:24.960
- I wanted to help, Frankie.
- She doesn't want our help.

18:25.028 --> 18:30.330
- It just makes me so sad.
- Me, too, Janie.

18:32.197 --> 18:34.998
Not a single two-six gang
member or known associate

18:35.065 --> 18:36.898
was in that courthouse yesterday.

18:36.933 --> 18:42.033
- A gang-free day?
- Two-six, anyway. I checked.

18:42.067 --> 18:45.001
- Where's Jane?
- She and Frankie went to grab coffee.

18:45.035 --> 18:46.435
- What's up?
- We have a cause of death.

18:46.469 --> 18:48.802
Judge Harper died of
methylphenidate overdose.

18:48.837 --> 18:52.572
- Translation? - She had toxic
levels of ritalin in her system.

18:55.043 --> 18:58.878
- Who the hell kills someone with ritalin?
- No one, apparently.

18:58.913 --> 19:01.780
I ran it against all solved and
unsolved homicides... nothing.

19:01.814 --> 19:04.568
Well, it's a common enough drug.
It's used to treat ADHD.

19:04.569 --> 19:07.029
Yeah, the drug unit is always
busting college kids who abuse it.

19:07.101 --> 19:10.152
- Helps them stay up and study.
- Maybe it's one of the kids on the mock-trial team.

19:10.186 --> 19:11.116
<i>That's what I've been thinking.</i>

19:11.155 --> 19:13.424
I'm trying to get into the
mock-trial website, but damn.

19:13.458 --> 19:16.794
<i>These kids are smart these days.
Come on.</i>

19:16.828 --> 19:18.128
Let me in.

19:18.196 --> 19:22.968
But wouldn't that smart teenager realize
that we'd eventually trace the drug?

19:23.002 --> 19:24.802
Plenty of M.E.'s
wouldn't have caught that.

19:26.805 --> 19:28.672
You said mock trial was competitive?

19:28.706 --> 19:29.940
One kid I knew put
his fist through a wall

19:29.974 --> 19:31.807
when he got cast as an understudy,

19:31.841 --> 19:34.746
tried to put his fist through my face
when he heard I got his role.

19:36.716 --> 19:38.518
- Yeah!
- What?

19:38.552 --> 19:39.619
I just beat an 128-bit encryption.

19:40.921 --> 19:44.957
<i> MockYourAdvisors.Com?</i>

19:44.991 --> 19:46.894
Wow, look at all these
complaints about Judge Harper.

19:46.928 --> 19:48.196
Frost, scroll down.

19:50.632 --> 19:52.601
Look at the quote from "Max"...

19:52.635 --> 19:55.305
"I'm sick of Ashley and her tiger mom.

19:55.339 --> 19:58.073
<i>I say we give Judge
Harper this sentence...</i>

19:58.107 --> 20:01.011
Death by lethal injection."

20:08.027 --> 20:10.961
I hope writing death
threats was worth it, Max.

20:11.029 --> 20:12.865
<i>You're all are being very literal,</i>

20:12.899 --> 20:14.735
- and you have no right to search my locker.
- We don't?

20:14.770 --> 20:17.440
The supreme court decided the
need to maintain order outweighs

20:17.441 --> 20:20.110
the privacy interests in
students in New Jersey vs. T.L.O.,

20:20.178 --> 20:22.916
if, and only if, you
have articulable facts.

20:22.950 --> 20:26.854
- You want "articulable facts"?
- I think he does, Detective Frost.

20:26.922 --> 20:31.160
The comments you made constitute
threats sufficient to justify the search.

20:31.195 --> 20:34.396
The supreme court also stated that
if the manner in which the search

20:34.397 --> 20:37.598
is conducted is reasonably related
to the objective, it's allowed.

20:37.632 --> 20:39.965
Wrong. I don't see a warrant,
and I'm not giving consent.

20:39.999 --> 20:41.733
Oh, that's okay.

20:41.767 --> 20:44.002
We've not only met the
reasonable suspicion standard

20:44.036 --> 20:46.136
but also the higher one...
probable cause.

20:46.170 --> 20:49.104
That's sufficient to satisfy
your 4th amendment concerns.

20:49.138 --> 20:52.440
- Very nice, Detective Rizzoli.
- Thank you, Detective Frost.

20:52.507 --> 20:55.374
- Your locker is messy, Max.
- Whatever.

20:55.442 --> 20:56.777
<i>Look. I'll admit I was
pissed at Judge Harper.</i>

20:56.811 --> 21:01.015
I am much more qualified than Ashley,
but my mom isn't the advisor.

21:01.049 --> 21:02.781
So you threatened Judge
Harper with a lethal injection,

21:02.815 --> 21:04.780
- and then you killed her.
- Right.

21:04.815 --> 21:07.014
I'm not stupid enough to kill a Judge.

21:07.048 --> 21:09.717
Besides murder one looks kind
of crappy on a transcript.

21:12.922 --> 21:16.623
<i> Ritalin.
A drug offense looks pretty crappy, too.</i>

21:16.657 --> 21:18.091
It's not illegal to take ritalin.

21:18.125 --> 21:20.027
It is if you don't have a
prescription. Do you got one?

21:22.130 --> 21:24.699
- I want to cut a deal.
- Now we're talking.

21:24.733 --> 21:26.402
I'll give up my dealer if
you'll agree not to charge me

21:26.436 --> 21:28.038
for an electronically
communicated threat.

21:28.072 --> 21:29.808
Well, what if we want to
charge you for murder, as well?

21:29.842 --> 21:32.777
I'm the backup prosecutor.
I never even left the courtroom.

21:32.811 --> 21:34.645
Want my dealer or not?

21:37.116 --> 21:40.151
I didn't sell ritalin to anybody.

21:40.152 --> 21:43.187
I just gave a couple pills to a friend.

21:43.221 --> 21:46.121
At least, I thought Max was a friend.

21:46.156 --> 21:49.725
I need to know where you
got the ritalin, Ashley.

21:49.759 --> 21:52.663
Ashley was diagnosed
with ADHD when she was 11.

21:52.697 --> 21:55.935
<i>Her pediatrician prescribed
it to help her concentrate.</i>

21:55.969 --> 21:57.703
So how long have you been taking it?

21:57.771 --> 22:00.506
- I don't anymore.
- My daughter was worried

22:00.541 --> 22:02.941
that Ashley was retreating from her life

22:02.976 --> 22:05.712
<i>because she was embarrassed
about the medication.</i>

22:05.746 --> 22:09.152
- So she let her stop taking it.
- How long ago was that?

22:09.187 --> 22:11.487
About seven months.
Right, honey?

22:11.522 --> 22:12.688
Yeah.

22:12.756 --> 22:15.524
So if you'd stopped taking the ritalin,

22:15.559 --> 22:17.475
where did you get the
pills to give to Max?

22:20.061 --> 22:22.498
I found a bottle in
mom's medicine cabinet.

22:22.532 --> 22:25.236
<i>- Ashley!
- A lot of kids take ritalin.</i>

22:25.270 --> 22:27.271
You know how huge the
workload is senior year,

22:27.305 --> 22:30.940
on top of college
applications and mock trial?

22:30.974 --> 22:36.915
Okay... I took some pills for
me, and I gave some to Max.

22:36.950 --> 22:39.885
What a jerk.

22:39.919 --> 22:42.085
Thank you for telling me the truth.

22:42.119 --> 22:45.887
Why would somebody kill my mom?

22:45.921 --> 22:48.592
I don't know yet,
but I want you to know

22:48.626 --> 22:51.027
that it is very important
to me to find out.

22:52.061 --> 22:54.802
Thank you.

22:54.836 --> 22:59.644
I knew your mom.
She was a good person.

23:01.815 --> 23:06.586
I'm so sorry for your loss, Ashley.
And yours, Mrs. Phillips.

23:10.824 --> 23:13.660
Hey, Dr. Isles.
I'm just reading a law reviewarticle

23:13.694 --> 23:16.932
Judge Harper and Roger Thorson
wrote when they were at BCU...

23:16.966 --> 23:19.166
"Rehabilitation instead of retribution."

23:20.234 --> 23:23.338
- She was amazing.
- Thinking about the road not taken?

23:24.708 --> 23:26.808
What's the matter with your wrist?

23:26.843 --> 23:28.542
I've had intermittent
tingling and stingers

23:28.576 --> 23:30.811
ever since I broke it in
the parking-garage collapse.

23:30.845 --> 23:32.748
- What did your Doctor say?
- He sent me to a neurologist.

23:32.782 --> 23:35.218
- She said there wasn't any nerve damage.
- Well, that's good.

23:35.252 --> 23:39.855
- So why am I still having pain?
- I have a thought.

23:39.889 --> 23:42.090
Let me try something, but no guarantees.

23:42.158 --> 23:43.691
I'm ready to try anything.

23:44.626 --> 23:47.129
Except needles, because
I don't... 

23:47.163 --> 23:48.732
<i>I don't like needles.</i>

23:48.766 --> 23:51.668
This won't hurt. I promise.

23:51.702 --> 23:57.271
<i>Okay.
The large intestines, L.I. of 11,</i>

23:57.339 --> 24:00.275
<i>on the affected side
near to the left elbow.</i>

24:00.310 --> 24:03.213
- Ooh, what are you doing to him?
- Shh.

24:03.247 --> 24:06.284
Acupuncture is supposed to be
performed in a calm environment.

24:06.318 --> 24:09.985
With all of your masks
of death staring at him?

24:10.020 --> 24:11.319
<i>They're tribal ritual masks.</i>

24:11.387 --> 24:14.087
- You don't find them soothing?
- Um...

24:14.155 --> 24:16.725
- Not really.
- Huh.

24:16.759 --> 24:18.360
Mm!

24:19.726 --> 24:21.325
Should you be doing that?

24:21.360 --> 24:24.261
- I'm certified.
- In acupuncture?

24:24.295 --> 24:27.296
I got a perfect score on the
N.C.C.A.O.M. exam in acupuncture

24:27.331 --> 24:29.230
<i>and on the foundations of
traditional Chinese medicine</i>

24:29.298 --> 24:32.001
- and the clean needle technique.
- All right, I'm not busting you.

24:32.069 --> 24:34.136
- I'm just asking.
- Oh.

24:34.170 --> 24:36.138
All right, give me an
update on Judge Harper.

24:36.172 --> 24:38.376
Something interesting came
back on her hair sample.

24:38.443 --> 24:40.746
She'd been taking ritalin
for at least six months

24:40.814 --> 24:43.781
- prior to her death.
- Did she have ADHD like her daughter?

24:43.815 --> 24:45.283
Well, there was no evidence
of that in her medical history,

24:45.317 --> 24:47.653
and no Doctor seems to
have prescribed it for her.

24:47.688 --> 24:49.256
- Hmm.
- I-I don't mean to be a bad patient,

24:49.290 --> 24:52.195
but I've stopped feeling calm.

24:52.230 --> 24:54.930
Okay.

24:54.964 --> 24:56.232
The last one.

24:57.403 --> 24:59.004
Try not to move.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.206
- Why was she taking ritalin?
- I don't know.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.207
But there were significant levels

25:02.241 --> 25:05.177
- of inert excipients in her blood.
- Pill binders?

25:05.211 --> 25:07.414
Yes. Which wouldn't be
present if taken orally.

25:07.448 --> 25:09.882
So you're saying the killer injected her

25:09.917 --> 25:12.017
- with dissolved pills?
- Yes.

25:12.085 --> 25:14.020
Look, Jane, whoever did this had
to have known she took ritalin

25:14.088 --> 25:15.790
and tried to make it look accidental.

25:18.392 --> 25:21.961
These are Judge Harper's
medical records from law school.

25:21.995 --> 25:25.462
I was curious about her dizzy spells
since they weren't alcohol-related.

25:25.496 --> 25:30.767
<i>The injury to her patella occurred
between her second and third year...</i>

25:30.802 --> 25:33.702
- I wonder how she fractured it.
- She was a runner. Maybe she fell.

25:33.736 --> 25:35.003
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

25:35.037 --> 25:37.806
She told the treating Doctor
that she didn't remember falling.

25:37.874 --> 25:39.743
<i>He ordered a lumbar puncture.</i>

25:39.777 --> 25:42.846
Aha!
Her hypocretin levels were low.

25:42.880 --> 25:44.680
Aha!

25:44.715 --> 25:46.150
Why are we saying "aha"?

25:46.185 --> 25:48.388
Well, it correlates with
the HLA gene test I ordered.

25:50.224 --> 25:52.125
<i>- Aha!
- Aha!</i>

25:52.160 --> 25:53.994
Judge Harper fell
because she blacked out.

25:54.029 --> 25:55.699
She suffered from narcolepsy.

25:55.733 --> 25:57.899
- That's why she was taking ritalin.
- Yes.

25:57.967 --> 26:00.202
Okay, wait. Why wasn't
it in her medical records,

26:00.237 --> 26:02.206
and why didn't she have
her own prescription?

26:02.240 --> 26:04.811
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

26:04.845 --> 26:06.812
Judge Harper clerked
for Judge Juliet Coker

26:06.847 --> 26:08.847
when she was in law school.

26:08.881 --> 26:11.384
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

26:11.419 --> 26:13.452
<i>Judge Coker was tossed from the bench</i>

26:13.520 --> 26:16.492
when someone found out
she was taking medication

26:16.526 --> 26:18.493
for bipolar disorder and leaked it.

26:18.527 --> 26:22.727
<i>Well, if she was taking medication,
why was she removed?</i>

26:22.762 --> 26:25.029
Was there evidence that her
condition affected her judgment?

26:25.063 --> 26:27.030
No.
No, it wasn't about her condition.

26:27.065 --> 26:30.534
She was a rising star.
The boys' club wouldn't have liked that.

26:30.568 --> 26:33.001
- They used it to get rid of her.
- So Judge Harper saw firsthand

26:33.069 --> 26:36.471
what happens when your competitors
know your weaknesses

26:36.472 --> 26:37.872
and your medical history.

26:37.906 --> 26:41.174
Which is why she kept
her narcolepsy a secret.

26:41.209 --> 26:43.376
Somebody knew.

26:53.526 --> 26:55.496
Oh, I can't today, Angela.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.897
<i>I dipped into Zorba's baklava at lunch.</i>

26:57.932 --> 27:04.072
I just tried to make my monthly
electronic payment to the I.R.S.

27:04.107 --> 27:05.473
Frank Sr.'s back taxes?

27:05.507 --> 27:09.143
They told me that I have a zero balance.

27:09.177 --> 27:11.381
- You think Frank paid it off?
- No.

27:11.415 --> 27:13.517
My sources tell me
he's completely broke.

27:16.187 --> 27:17.587
Was it you?

27:17.621 --> 27:21.456
I promised you
I would not interfere, and I didn't.

27:21.490 --> 27:26.194
Well, then, maybe it
was a clerical mistake.

27:28.200 --> 27:31.503
When they find it, are
they gonna throw me in jail?

27:31.537 --> 27:34.073
<i>I'm gonna have to tell
them it's gonna take me</i>

27:34.108 --> 27:37.345
22 years to pay off that bill.

27:37.380 --> 27:39.382
I might know someone I can
call, find out what's up.

27:39.416 --> 27:41.114
Really? Thanks.

27:41.149 --> 27:43.581
- Hey, Ma.
- Hi, honey.

27:43.615 --> 27:46.318
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

27:46.353 --> 27:49.521
<i>I was just trying to give a
brownie to Sergeant Korsak.</i>

27:49.555 --> 27:54.854
But he'd rather have some
carrots instead. No charge.

27:54.889 --> 27:56.156
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

27:57.628 --> 27:59.296
I found something in Judge
Harper's phone records...

27:59.330 --> 28:00.563
a guy named Dustin Williams

28:00.598 --> 28:02.031
who's been calling her
every day for weeks.

28:02.065 --> 28:04.201
Frost, can you check Frankie's list,

28:04.235 --> 28:06.470
see if Dustin Williams was
in the courthouse yesterday?

28:06.538 --> 28:09.337
Yeah, but wait. How would he
know that she took ritalin?

28:09.371 --> 28:12.274
Did you check to see if he filed
a formal complaint against her?

28:12.308 --> 28:15.944
- He did.
- Dustin Williams is on the list

28:15.979 --> 28:18.143
and didn't leave the
courthouse until 5:45 P.M.

28:21.380 --> 28:23.580
<i>You filed a formal complaint
against Judge Harper.</i>

28:23.615 --> 28:27.985
- To get justice for my son.
- Joey Williams is your son?

28:29.287 --> 28:32.559
- That's right.
- He was convicted of burglary.

28:32.594 --> 28:34.897
Judge Harper sentenced him to
up to three years at Starbridge.

28:34.932 --> 28:37.131
- Why there?
- Ask Judge Harper.

28:38.166 --> 28:39.536
She's dead.

28:42.273 --> 28:46.244
She said since Joey was 17
and a first-time offender,

28:46.279 --> 28:48.643
it would be a good place
to turn his life around.

28:48.678 --> 28:50.511
She put him with scum!

28:50.579 --> 28:52.347
<i>You seem pretty angry, Mr. Williams.</i>

28:52.414 --> 28:55.249
Angry enough to kill a Judge
who sentenced your son?

28:55.283 --> 28:58.517
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Then what were you doing at the courthouse yesterday?

28:58.551 --> 29:01.252
Trying to get what I'm entitled to...
copies of Joey's case file,

29:01.286 --> 29:03.486
<i>so I could sue that
hellhole of a prison.</i>

29:03.554 --> 29:05.122
<i>Joey didn't much like it there.</i>

29:05.190 --> 29:07.293
- They extended his sentence.
- They added four years.

29:07.328 --> 29:09.063
- What did he do?
- Nothing!

29:09.097 --> 29:10.933
They said he attacked
someone, but that wasn't Joey.

29:10.967 --> 29:13.301
He was scared out of his mind.

29:13.336 --> 29:14.704
I begged Judge Harper
to get him out of there.

29:14.738 --> 29:16.406
Is that why you kept calling her?

29:16.440 --> 29:18.240
She said she believed he
didn't deserve that extension.

29:18.274 --> 29:19.908
She said she'd look into it.

29:19.943 --> 29:22.212
- Did she?
- She didn't do a damn thing.

29:22.246 --> 29:24.612
It's because of her my son's dead.

29:30.255 --> 29:32.626
- When did he die?
- Last week.

29:32.660 --> 29:37.296
Prison gave me some bullshit
story about kidney failure,

29:37.330 --> 29:40.434
but Joey never had any
problem with his kidneys.

29:40.501 --> 29:43.636
- And you blame Judge Harper for that?
- Hell yeah. She put him in there.

29:43.670 --> 29:45.337
<i>I bet she was taking kickbacks.</i>

29:47.139 --> 29:51.509
You go ahead, arrest me.
Charge me with her murder.

29:51.543 --> 29:56.382
I'll confess, as long as
you look into my son's death.

30:00.256 --> 30:02.091
Judge's financials are clear.

30:02.125 --> 30:05.295
I knew she wasn't taking kickbacks.
She wasn't that kind of person.

30:05.363 --> 30:08.695
Dad's alibi checks out.
Clerk's office said he showed up

30:08.729 --> 30:10.197
<i> at 4:30 and refused to leave
without his son's file.</i>

30:10.232 --> 30:14.006
- Court security hauled him out at 5:45.
- Judge Harper believed in rehabilitation.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.641
Is that why she sent Joey to Starbridge?

30:15.676 --> 30:18.411
Can you pull up their website?

30:18.445 --> 30:20.583
Got it.

30:20.617 --> 30:25.153
Nice prison... a library, classrooms,

30:25.188 --> 30:27.526
<i>basketball court, computer room.</i>

30:27.560 --> 30:31.198
- It's minimum security.
- Yeah. Mostly first-time offenders.

30:31.233 --> 30:33.769
An 18% recidivism rate?
That's low.

30:33.803 --> 30:35.606
Starbridge should run all the prisons

30:35.640 --> 30:38.444
<i>if they can turn 82% of their
inmates into solid citizens.</i>

30:38.478 --> 30:40.681
Frost, pull up Starbridge's financials.

30:42.351 --> 30:45.290
They showed record profits
in the last two quarters.

30:45.324 --> 30:48.261
Must be a big place.
Every prison gets paid by the prisoner.

30:48.328 --> 30:50.396
Let's look at anyone
Judge Harper sentenced there.

30:53.565 --> 30:55.535
Every one of them was
a first-time offender.

30:55.570 --> 30:58.806
Jane, they all had
their sentences extended.

30:58.841 --> 31:00.808
For the same thing. Look.
It says "behavior violations."

31:00.843 --> 31:02.343
<i>Same as Joey Williams.</i>

31:02.411 --> 31:04.113
The extensions file in her briefcase...

31:04.148 --> 31:06.081
She was checking into
Joey's extended sentence,

31:06.116 --> 31:08.082
and somebody took the
contents of that file.

31:08.116 --> 31:11.218
I have Joey Williams' autopsy
reports from Starbridge.

31:11.253 --> 31:13.188
<i>I checked it against all
of his medical records.</i>

31:13.222 --> 31:17.123
He has a blood condition...
benign familial erythrocytosis.

31:17.158 --> 31:18.191
What's that mean?

31:18.225 --> 31:21.226
Well, his red-blood-cell count
was consistently elevated,

31:21.260 --> 31:24.229
but his autopsy CBC blood test
showed no signs of elevation.

31:24.263 --> 31:26.196
- That's not possible.
- Yeah, it is.

31:26.230 --> 31:28.464
It wasn't Joey's blood.

31:28.533 --> 31:31.336
Judge Harper had a daughter that was 17.

31:31.370 --> 31:34.838
<i>She cared about teenagers.
Joey was 17.</i>

31:34.872 --> 31:37.140
She was looking into Starbridge.
We need to go there.

31:37.175 --> 31:39.510
It's a private prison. They're
not just gonna let you poke around.

31:39.545 --> 31:42.279
They might. If they think
we're all on the same side.

31:45.415 --> 31:50.584
- Do you know this Dustin Williams guy?
- Better than I'd like to.

31:50.652 --> 31:53.255
Us, too... he's been raising
holy hell at the station.

31:53.290 --> 31:57.491
He's even asked Dr. Isles
here to exhume his son's body

31:57.525 --> 32:00.596
- to do another autopsy.
- He's like a bad penny, that one.

32:00.630 --> 32:01.798
We need got to him off our back.

32:01.833 --> 32:06.204
Yeah. So just give us the 25-cent tour,
and we will sign off on this thing

32:06.238 --> 32:08.945
- and finally be rid of that nut ball.
- Nothing would make me happier.

32:08.980 --> 32:10.345
Fantastic.

32:12.881 --> 32:17.254
"Starbridge: Do your time, cross
the bridge to a better life."

32:17.288 --> 32:19.258
<i>We try to make a difference.</i>

32:19.293 --> 32:22.295
That's why we only take
minimum-security offenders.

32:22.330 --> 32:25.432
- How do you manage such a low recidivism rate?
- We have a lot to offer...

32:25.467 --> 32:27.772
Classes to get your high-school G.E.D.,

32:27.806 --> 32:29.474
<i>college courses,
counseling, fitness center.</i>

32:29.508 --> 32:30.908
- We've got it all.
- Mm.

32:32.277 --> 32:34.411
Uh, we would love to see
where you house the prisoners.

32:34.445 --> 32:36.946
Oh, that's off limits,
even to the good guys.

32:36.980 --> 32:38.549
- Sorry.
- No problem.

32:44.452 --> 32:45.721
Jane, are you all right?

32:45.756 --> 32:47.423
Oh.

32:47.457 --> 32:48.457
No.

32:49.626 --> 32:51.593
Oh, no. Uh, you know, she
has terrible dysmenorrhea.

32:51.627 --> 32:54.899
Do you have ladies' room?

32:54.933 --> 32:57.968
Uh, there's only one.
It's... it's all the way

32:58.003 --> 32:59.638
<i>- on the other side of the facility.
- I need that one!</i>

32:59.672 --> 33:01.709
<i>Oh, I-I'm gonna... I'm gonna
come with you, Detective.</i>

33:01.776 --> 33:04.377
Excuse us.
Jane...

33:06.479 --> 33:08.213
Did ever have a female partner?

33:08.248 --> 33:09.848
- No.
- Pbht.

33:09.883 --> 33:12.619
- What a pain in the ass.
- You're telling me.

33:17.223 --> 33:20.293
- Where did you get that card?
- Borrowed it.

33:20.327 --> 33:22.631
This is making me very itchy.

33:22.666 --> 33:25.101
I'll get you some benadryl.
All right, come on.

33:25.136 --> 33:27.354
We got to figure out
what happened to Joey.

33:28.082 --> 33:29.405
<i>Go.</i>

33:45.561 --> 33:49.864
<i>There's four people to a one-man cell.</i>

33:49.899 --> 33:52.333
<i>- Are those gang tattoos?
- Yeah, hard-core gangbangers.</i>

33:52.368 --> 33:54.337
<i>They're not first-time offenders.</i>

33:54.371 --> 33:57.038
<i>And this definitely
isn't minimum security.</i>

33:59.574 --> 34:01.409
"Monday and Friday"?

34:01.444 --> 34:03.280
Well, how could a prison offer
inmates access to medical care

34:03.315 --> 34:06.785
- for only six hours a week?
- Dig deep. Find his records.

34:08.387 --> 34:10.788
Staphylococcus bacteria
must be teeming in here,

34:10.822 --> 34:14.422
- along with e.Coli.
- Don't start again.

34:14.456 --> 34:17.895
Here it is. Here it is.
Joseph Williams' medical records.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.563
Frost?

34:19.598 --> 34:22.531
- Hit me.
- Get into the bureau of prisons database.

34:22.598 --> 34:24.032
Okay.

34:24.065 --> 34:27.568
Pull up a listing of
all Starbridge inmates.

34:27.601 --> 34:30.301
What are you looking for?

34:30.335 --> 34:32.835
Sort for longest to shortest
sentences, and then start reading.

34:32.870 --> 34:34.902
Okay.

34:34.937 --> 34:37.670
"Murder one, murder one,
second-degree murder."

34:37.737 --> 34:39.472
A lot of those.

34:39.505 --> 34:41.409
<i>"Assault with a deadly weapon."
Lots of those. </i>

34:41.476 --> 34:43.411
- And lots of rapes.
- Does that sound like a place

34:43.445 --> 34:45.911
to send a 17-year-old
first-time burglar?

34:45.980 --> 34:48.239
I'm surprised the kid lasted
as long as he did.

34:48.255 --> 34:51.013
Jane... Joey Williams
didn't die of kidney failure.

34:51.081 --> 34:53.647
- You sure?
- Well, I'd prefer to do an autopsy.

34:53.681 --> 34:55.882
I'd prefer to be in Hawaii.
What does it say in his report?

34:55.916 --> 34:58.483
Okay, look, what Starbridge
reported to the state

34:58.519 --> 35:02.055
conflicts with his chart.
He had elevated blood CO2 levels.

35:02.089 --> 35:04.289
That's consistent with
suffocation, not kidney failure.

35:04.324 --> 35:06.459
It would be in Starbridge's
interest to cover up a prison murder

35:06.493 --> 35:07.828
to keep their contract with the state.

35:07.896 --> 35:11.730
Judge Harper must have pressed
Starbridge after Joey's death.

35:11.764 --> 35:15.836
- I think we just found motive.
- Jane, there's ritalin here.

35:18.807 --> 35:22.545
It's Korsak. Warden's on
high alert, looking for us...

35:22.580 --> 35:24.782
Frost, did you find Judge Harper

35:24.817 --> 35:26.984
- on yesterday's courthouse footage?
- I wasn't looking for her, but I can.

35:27.018 --> 35:29.519
- Okay. Jane, let's go.
- Okay. Track her.

35:29.554 --> 35:31.122
<i>I want to know everyone
that she talked to yesterday.</i>

35:31.157 --> 35:32.825
Okay. Korsak is texting
me. Now, come on.

35:32.860 --> 35:34.359
We need to get out of here.

35:34.426 --> 35:35.792
Frost, I got to go. Bye.

35:46.789 --> 35:48.189
Oh, man.

35:48.223 --> 35:50.592
I thought I was gonna have
to visit you at Starbridge.

35:50.626 --> 35:52.093
Oh. We should have called.

35:52.127 --> 35:53.527
How did you get away from the warden?

35:53.562 --> 35:54.996
- You don't want to know.
- Yeah, I do.

35:55.030 --> 35:58.532
- I said I needed a tampon.
- Worked like a charm.

35:58.601 --> 36:00.068
I've found something, Jane.

36:00.102 --> 36:02.904
Judge Harper and Roger Thorson
had coffee together.

36:02.972 --> 36:05.607
Yeah, uh, they went over the
mock trial. He told us about it.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.441
But something happened
between them. Watch.

36:11.146 --> 36:12.480
That's quite a disagreement.

36:12.514 --> 36:14.882
Zoom in on that file folder.

36:17.720 --> 36:19.553
It's the "extensions" folder.

36:19.622 --> 36:21.990
So she was talking about
Joey's sentence extension.

36:22.024 --> 36:23.290
Why are they arguing?

36:25.761 --> 36:27.595
Wait, frost, stop. Go back.

36:28.998 --> 36:30.665
What's on that paper she's showing him?

36:32.101 --> 36:34.836
It's a complaint to the
office of bar counsel.

36:34.870 --> 36:36.838
Judge Harper wanted someone disbarred.

36:36.872 --> 36:38.840
Who? Hit "play."

36:42.678 --> 36:44.879
Well, whatever he said made
her rip up that complaint.

36:44.913 --> 36:46.648
What do we know about Roger Thorson?

36:46.682 --> 36:48.883
They were friends, went
to law school together.

36:48.917 --> 36:50.435
They even co-wrote
articles for the law review.

36:50.470 --> 36:52.253
He's a corporate attorney now.

36:52.320 --> 36:55.657
- Does he have any connection to Starbridge?
- Checking.

36:56.825 --> 37:00.728
- His firm represents them.
- Who else does he represent?

37:00.763 --> 37:02.196
<i>No one.</i>

37:03.198 --> 37:06.901
Okay. So, he gave Judge Harper
the sales job on Starbridge.

37:06.969 --> 37:08.903
That's why she was sentencing
first-time offenders there.

37:08.971 --> 37:10.638
She thought they were on the same side.

37:10.673 --> 37:11.906
<i>The law review article
you were reading ...</i>

37:11.940 --> 37:14.642
"Rehabilitation instead of retribution."

37:15.978 --> 37:18.146
She learned too late
that Roger had sold out.

37:18.180 --> 37:20.092
Tens of millions of dollars
at stake with a private prison.

37:20.137 --> 37:23.084
Wait, it ...
it wasn't just about the money.

37:23.118 --> 37:26.620
She was threatening to get him disbarred
with the complaint that she tore up.

37:26.689 --> 37:28.222
He'd lose everything.

37:28.256 --> 37:30.958
Keep watching.
Look what he's doing now.

37:30.993 --> 37:33.094
Emptying the "extensions" folder.

37:34.128 --> 37:36.964
And taking a manila envelope.

37:36.999 --> 37:38.866
The law clerk said the judge
came back for something.

37:38.934 --> 37:43.604
Permission slips!
That's why she left the courtroom.

37:43.638 --> 37:45.907
Well, you're not allowed
to start the competition

37:45.941 --> 37:48.009
until you've turned in all
the kids' permission slips.

37:48.077 --> 37:49.944
Let's get a warrant.

37:58.020 --> 37:59.854
Detectives, approach, please.

37:59.888 --> 38:02.590
Thank you, your honor.
Are those the permission slips?

38:02.624 --> 38:05.727
Any news?
The kids are just about to come in

38:05.761 --> 38:07.862
- to finish the mock-trial competition.
- Yeah, I have some news, Roger,

38:07.896 --> 38:09.897
starting with the permission slips

38:09.932 --> 38:12.100
that you took from
Judge Harper's briefcase.

38:12.134 --> 38:13.868
I'm sorry?

38:13.902 --> 38:15.937
- She left them in the courtroom.
- No.

38:15.971 --> 38:18.106
You convinced her that she
left them in her office.

38:18.140 --> 38:19.807
That way you could
start the competition.

38:19.875 --> 38:22.710
Everyone was watching Ashley.
No one noticed you slip out,

38:22.745 --> 38:24.846
and you waited for Judge
Harper in the stairwell,

38:24.880 --> 38:27.014
and then you injected her with ritalin.

38:27.049 --> 38:29.416
You're out of your mind!

38:30.719 --> 38:32.920
I tried to save her.
I gave her CPR.

38:32.955 --> 38:34.889
Yeah, you had to think fast.

38:34.923 --> 38:36.791
What if she had been
able to talk, Roger?

38:36.825 --> 38:38.826
That must have shocked the hell out
of you when she made it back here.

38:38.894 --> 38:42.363
You knew about her narcolepsy
diagnosis, knew she took ritalin.

38:42.397 --> 38:44.799
- This is obscene.
- Yes, it is.

38:44.833 --> 38:46.968
We executed a search
warrant at your house.

38:47.002 --> 38:50.037
We found paint from the stairwell
and fibers from the judge's dress

38:50.072 --> 38:52.306
- on the suit you were wearing.
- Of course you did!

38:52.340 --> 38:53.775
I was trying to start her heart.
She was my friend.

38:53.809 --> 38:56.844
And you made sure you touched her
in case you were ever a suspect.

38:56.879 --> 38:58.646
- That's not true!
- No?

38:58.680 --> 39:00.948
Since when did CPR
require a syringe filled with ritalin?

39:01.016 --> 39:03.985
What syringe?
Oh, the supposed murder weapon?

39:04.019 --> 39:05.653
Do you have that? Did you ...

39:05.687 --> 39:07.088
did you recover it when
you tore apart my house?

39:07.122 --> 39:08.923
I'm sure you disposed of it.

39:08.957 --> 39:11.659
Luckily, you carried that
syringe out of the courthouse

39:11.693 --> 39:13.261
in your suit pocket.

39:13.295 --> 39:17.553
We found traces of ritalin
and her blood on your clothes.

39:24.472 --> 39:27.275
Hey!
Hi, Vince.

39:27.342 --> 39:30.144
My friend at the I.R.S. confirms it.

39:30.179 --> 39:32.446
Your debt is paid off.

39:39.121 --> 39:41.689
Oh, I feel like I just got my life back!

39:46.261 --> 39:47.929
He's not supposed to be drinking.

39:47.996 --> 39:49.330
- It's a soda.
- Oh.

39:49.364 --> 39:51.765
Hey, everyone, next round's on me!

39:54.303 --> 39:56.871
You, too, Jane.
And, of course, you, too, Maura.

39:58.140 --> 40:01.876
- What are you doing, Tommy?
- I'm celebrating.

40:01.910 --> 40:03.811
My case against the
Storrow Center settled.

40:03.879 --> 40:07.949
- Oh, Tommy!
- Tommy, hey. Listen...

40:07.983 --> 40:10.351
maybe it's best that you don't
spend your money like this.

40:10.385 --> 40:12.186
Ma, I want you to stop worrying, okay,

40:12.221 --> 40:14.421
about me, and now you can
stop worrying about, you know,

40:14.489 --> 40:16.324
your financial issues.

40:18.894 --> 40:20.027
Tommy, you didn't.

40:21.363 --> 40:23.130
- Didn't what?
- You paid off her debt?

40:23.165 --> 40:26.734
- You paid off the I.R.S.?
- $27,000?

40:26.768 --> 40:28.936
How do you two know?!

40:30.873 --> 40:32.273
- Vince?
- Don't look at me.

40:32.307 --> 40:33.374
I didn't say a word.

40:34.476 --> 40:37.912
Uh... well... we ...

40:38.914 --> 40:41.983
No. I.
I... wa...

40:42.017 --> 40:44.886
- It was just a long story ...
- I told them.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.921
Look, you shouldn't have to
do everything on your own.

40:46.955 --> 40:48.256
They wanted to help, just like me.

40:49.457 --> 40:53.294
<i>Oh, come here, Tommy.
Thank you.</i>

40:54.429 --> 40:56.397
Ma, I can't breathe.

40:57.031 --> 41:00.268
Listen...
I'm gonna pay you every penny, son.

41:00.302 --> 41:01.903
I promise ... with interest.

41:01.937 --> 41:05.439
- Ma, look. I owe you plenty.
- No, I ...

41:05.507 --> 41:06.840
Wow.

41:06.875 --> 41:08.276
I'm proud of you, Tommy.

41:09.344 --> 41:11.145
You're the man that Pop never was.

41:11.179 --> 41:13.180
You don't have to get
all mushy on me, Jane.

41:13.215 --> 41:17.285
Well, I can if I want to!
Oh, I love you so much.

41:18.387 --> 41:20.021
I love you. And listen, okay.

41:20.055 --> 41:22.023
You are not allowed to do
this on your own, all right?

41:22.057 --> 41:24.191
- Frankie and I will split it with you.
- Thanks, Jane.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.928
Well, listen, since
we're all hugging here,

41:26.962 --> 41:30.464
- can I hug Maura, too?
- You bet.

41:30.532 --> 41:35.036
<i>- Hands where I can see them.
- What?</i>

41:35.103 --> 41:36.804
<i>What about you, Korsak?
You want a hug?</i>

41:36.838 --> 41:38.439
<i>- Come on! Give me a hug!
- All right!</i>
