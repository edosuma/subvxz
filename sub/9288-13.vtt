00:12.163 --> 00:13.357
Right now...

00:13.631 --> 00:15.724
...terrorists are plannlng to assassinate...

00:15.800 --> 00:17.893
...a presidential candidate.

00:17.969 --> 00:20.870
My wife and daughter
have been kidnapped...

00:20.939 --> 00:24.670
...and people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:25.143 --> 00:27.338
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.

00:27.679 --> 00:30.307
This is the longest day of my life.

01:14.192 --> 01:16.717
Take the jeep, cut 'em of
at the service road.

01:16.794 --> 01:19.627
- The rest of you go behind him.
- I thought...

01:20.164 --> 01:22.428
How could you let this happen?

01:23.868 --> 01:25.597
Cutting 'em off at the service road.

01:25.670 --> 01:28.332
Bauer, his wife and daughter and Rick.

01:28.439 --> 01:30.839
Make sure they don't double back.

01:31.276 --> 01:33.710
I thought I could handle them.

01:33.778 --> 01:35.268
Stop thinking.

01:53.431 --> 01:55.456
We have to keep moving.

01:55.533 --> 01:57.501
- What if Dad is...
- Your Dad's okay.

01:58.102 --> 02:00.832
He said meet him at the water tower.
Let's do that.

02:00.905 --> 02:04.705
Come on, we just have to follow the creek.
Let's go, come on!

02:13.985 --> 02:15.213
I can't.

02:15.286 --> 02:17.516
Shut up. You can and you will.

02:17.689 --> 02:19.020
I'm slowing you down.

02:19.090 --> 02:22.150
Yes, you are,
so you better start speeding up.

02:23.594 --> 02:24.720
Get down.

02:37.575 --> 02:39.270
Pollock, where are you?

02:41.446 --> 02:43.209
Yeah, I got nothing.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.901
We can move.

03:30.911 --> 03:31.969
Wait.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.307
Get down.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.556
What are we going to do, Mom?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.592
We can't go back,
we can't go forward.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.395
They're everywhere.

03:58.672 --> 04:01.232
We can catch the road
where it cuts through the woods.

04:01.308 --> 04:05.369
- Dad told us to follow the creek bed.
- We don't have a choice, do we, Kimberly?

04:05.445 --> 04:06.707
We'll go up here.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.306
Come on.

04:20.459 --> 04:23.224
The subscriber
you're trying to reach...

04:30.037 --> 04:33.564
Hey. The property where
they're holding Jack's family...

04:33.640 --> 04:36.632
...was leased six months ago
by a company that doesn't exist.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.178
I have to go over the tax records.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.004
You all right?

04:42.416 --> 04:44.976
Jack's still not answering his cell.

04:45.752 --> 04:48.084
He could've shut it off
to keep it from ringing.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.782
Maybe something's happened to him.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.620
If anybody knows
how to take care of himself, it's Jack.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.855
Our tactical unit should be
there in minutes.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.295
Bundy's heading up the operation.
He's good.

04:58.365 --> 05:01.459
Maybe you're right.
I should've brought Green in sooner.

05:02.202 --> 05:05.262
You let Jack make the call
because it was his family on the line.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.162
What could you do?

05:07.641 --> 05:08.733
Yeah.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.639
Look, I'm sorry.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.876
Since this whole thing got started...

05:18.952 --> 05:21.011
...I guess I've been a little harsh.

05:21.722 --> 05:22.984
A little?

05:24.424 --> 05:26.119
Okay, maybe a lot.

05:28.428 --> 05:31.022
I've been afraid...

05:31.098 --> 05:33.191
You don't have to explain, all right?

05:33.333 --> 05:36.530
You want to talk about us,
we'll talk about it later. Okay?

05:36.603 --> 05:38.662
I just want you to know that it's nothing...

05:38.739 --> 05:41.367
You're bringing in Jamey Farrell's mother?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.839
Yes, to pick up Kyle, her son.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.605
Before she sees him
I want the two of you to question her.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.446
If she has information that
can help us protect Palmer, I need to know.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.280
Why do you think she has information?

05:52.352 --> 05:56.948
$300,000 was deposited in her
bank account over the last four months.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.224
They killed George Ferragamo.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.287
That fire was no accident.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.766
I want to talk to Maureen Kingsley,
then go right to the DA.

06:08.835 --> 06:11.668
Wait until you have the facts
before you go off.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.438
The facts?

06:13.507 --> 06:16.101
- He was killed so I'd get elected.
- You don't know that.

06:16.176 --> 06:19.873
- What do you think happened?
- I'm saying let's take a beat...

06:20.414 --> 06:23.178
...to see how we should play this
before we do anything.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.377
There's only one way to play this, Mike.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.952
Maureen Kingsley is going to get
the story of her career after all.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.011
David...

06:30.090 --> 06:32.183
After I talk to her, I'll see the DA.

06:32.259 --> 06:33.521
Shouldn't you ask Sherry?

06:33.727 --> 06:35.888
Why? So she can try to talk me out of it?

06:35.962 --> 06:37.862
She's your wife, David.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.462
This is her life, too.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.330
She deserves to know.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.202
Has the compound been cleared?

06:49.276 --> 06:51.073
Yes, but there's been a change of plan.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.168
Meaning?

06:52.245 --> 06:54.770
Bauer showed up here
like I said he would.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.315
You have him.

06:56.983 --> 06:58.746
Not yet, but I will.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.383
Congratulations, Ira.

07:01.788 --> 07:04.814
You may have bought
yourself a second chance.

07:04.891 --> 07:09.089
My contract included killing Palmer.
I want to make good on it.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.424
The way you were talking...

07:10.497 --> 07:13.398
...it sounded like you handed it off
to someone else.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.665
Bring me Bauer's body.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.367
Then we'll talk about the Senator.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.429
You'll hear from me soon.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.438
Drazen?

07:26.613 --> 07:27.705
Yeah.

07:28.014 --> 07:29.606
Either we eliminate Bauer...

07:29.683 --> 07:31.651
...or Drazen eliminates us.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.982
And that's the only option here.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.385
Basically.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.288
Getting Bauer
is not as easy as it sounds.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.692
I heard him phoning in some
GPS coordinates to somebody.

07:41.761 --> 07:45.458
Whoever that somebody Is,
they'll be calling the cavalry In soon.

07:45.532 --> 07:48.501
I say we just cut our losses
and get the hell out of here.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.493
You don't get the hell out
with these people.

07:51.571 --> 07:55.564
They come after you and keep coming until
they find you, no matter where you are.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.371
And when they do...

07:57.844 --> 08:00.278
Believe me, killing Bauer...

08:00.347 --> 08:03.043
...is our only chance of staying alive.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.113
They should've been here by now.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.452
Come here. Sit down.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.584
Easy.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.284
Let me take a look at It.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.490
Okay.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.931
This Is going to sting for a while
but you're not mortally wounded.

08:56.002 --> 08:58.562
The bullet passed straight through,
didn't hit bone...

08:58.638 --> 09:00.196
...and it missed your major artery.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.501
You got any loose clothing?

09:01.575 --> 09:02.837
Yeah, in my back pocket.

09:03.009 --> 09:04.271
I got it.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.776
Take a deep breath.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.413
Wait. Hold up, honey.

09:16.489 --> 09:17.615
Are you okay?

09:17.691 --> 09:18.715
Yeah, no, I just...

09:18.792 --> 09:21.226
I just want to check where we are.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.465
We may have veered a little south.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.933
We should've hit the road by now.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.468
I can't see it. Do you see it up ahead?

09:38.278 --> 09:40.439
You don't know where we are, do you?

09:42.983 --> 09:44.075
Mom?

09:46.886 --> 09:48.751
We're lost, aren't we?

09:50.123 --> 09:51.147
No.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.652
We should just go straight.

09:55.161 --> 09:56.753
It should be just up ahead.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.297
Are you sure?

10:14.131 --> 10:16.429
That'll help stop the bleeding.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.529
That's good. Just put it on the clean print.

10:32.449 --> 10:34.974
Mike's your advisor. What's his advice?

10:39.723 --> 10:41.384
He agrees with me.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.454
He thinks you're making a mistake
by taking them on.

10:46.797 --> 10:48.856
They've already covered up one death.

10:48.932 --> 10:51.867
You don't know what happened
to Ferragamo.

10:56.273 --> 10:58.366
But even if you're right...

11:00.510 --> 11:03.172
...will turning this into a media circus...

11:03.246 --> 11:04.611
...bring him back to life?

11:04.681 --> 11:06.012
No, that's not the point.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.106
Your career...

11:07.951 --> 11:09.578
...and your family...

11:10.153 --> 11:13.020
...you're throwing away...

11:13.089 --> 11:14.647
...everything you've built.

11:15.692 --> 11:17.353
Without any hard evidence...

11:17.427 --> 11:19.418
...of what really happened.

11:19.496 --> 11:21.521
Police will find the evidence.

11:21.598 --> 11:22.622
No.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.192
They won't because Carl...

11:25.268 --> 11:27.463
...and the people he works for...

11:27.537 --> 11:29.698
...they will twist the system...

11:29.773 --> 11:31.866
...to get the result that they want.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.536
That's what they do, David.

11:37.848 --> 11:40.180
And you'll be left with nothing.

11:46.723 --> 11:50.318
Sweetheart, to fight these people,
you need power.

11:52.696 --> 11:55.164
The kind of power you will have...

11:55.298 --> 11:57.823
...once you become President.

12:03.974 --> 12:08.775
We knew from the start
that this was going to be an uphill race.

12:11.014 --> 12:12.914
But we're almost there.

12:14.517 --> 12:16.178
Look at the polls.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.619
Sherry, I don't know.

12:23.693 --> 12:25.684
No, think, David. Think.

12:31.601 --> 12:36.436
Think of the millions of lives
you can make better...

12:36.506 --> 12:38.701
...once you win the candidacy.

12:39.075 --> 12:40.838
How can I do the job...

12:43.046 --> 12:45.310
...when my own house isn't in order?

12:48.184 --> 12:49.412
David...

12:59.396 --> 13:01.364
I told them to wait at the water tower.

13:01.431 --> 13:03.626
You heard me say that, right?

13:04.134 --> 13:05.431
What are you going to do?

13:05.502 --> 13:07.834
I gotta go back and find them.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.398
Green.

13:12.475 --> 13:15.569
- Alberta, there's been a complication.
- I'm listening.

13:15.645 --> 13:18.045
Teri and Kim are not where
they were supposed to be.

13:18.114 --> 13:19.877
I've got to go back and find them.

13:19.950 --> 13:22.578
I need to tell the incoming team
where to pick you up.

13:22.652 --> 13:25.780
At an abandoned water tower,
north area of the compound.

13:25.855 --> 13:28.983
Check your satellite photos.
It's overlooking a reservoir.

13:29.192 --> 13:33.094
If I'm not back when the team arrives,
they'll flnd a kid In here.

13:33.163 --> 13:36.394
- His name is Rick. He's wounded.
- Who is he?

13:36.466 --> 13:38.491
He helped us get out of there.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.365
Three tactical units are on their way.

13:40.537 --> 13:41.799
How much longer?

13:41.871 --> 13:43.202
Ten minutes, 15 tops.

13:43.273 --> 13:45.036
Okay, I copy. Out.

13:46.676 --> 13:47.768
Jack.

13:48.311 --> 13:50.176
- What?
- Thanks.

13:51.281 --> 13:53.772
Don't thank me. Thank my daughter.

13:54.951 --> 13:57.579
This thing, believe me,
I had no idea what was going on.

13:57.654 --> 14:00.885
Dan said we were just trying to scare guys
who backed out of a deal.

14:00.957 --> 14:03.755
When you started to see
what was happening...

14:03.827 --> 14:05.920
...you should have done something.

14:05.996 --> 14:07.623
He was my friend.

14:08.465 --> 14:10.797
Hey. You kidnapped my daughter.

14:11.501 --> 14:13.765
You're going to have to live with that.

14:17.073 --> 14:20.406
Part of getting a second chance
is taking responsibility...

14:20.477 --> 14:22.945
...for the mess you made.
You understand me?

14:25.281 --> 14:27.875
Good. I'll be back in a few minutes.

15:03.319 --> 15:07.483
That shack over there, maybe we can
find it on this and see where we are.

15:11.694 --> 15:14.424
See? I don't think we're as far off
as I thought.

15:16.800 --> 15:17.858
Mom!

15:24.174 --> 15:26.108
Honey, come on. Stay down.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.371
Go.

16:24.267 --> 16:26.360
Kim, get down.

16:59.202 --> 17:02.399
It's Gaines. Everyone circle
back to Section Five.

17:18.425 --> 17:19.517
Okay.

17:20.761 --> 17:23.025
When he gets to the back of
the shed, we'll go.

17:23.096 --> 17:24.222
What if he sees us?

17:24.297 --> 17:25.855
We'll be all right.

17:25.932 --> 17:26.921
Are you okay?

17:27.000 --> 17:27.932
Yeah, it's nothing.

17:28.001 --> 17:29.332
Mom, you keep saying that, but...

17:29.403 --> 17:32.270
It's going to be fine.
I promise, honey, it's fine.

17:32.339 --> 17:34.398
- Mom!
- Teri, stay down!

17:51.491 --> 17:52.583
Jack!

17:52.692 --> 17:54.523
- Are you both okay?
- Yeah.

17:54.594 --> 17:55.583
Come here.

17:55.662 --> 17:57.027
Who's shooting?

17:59.699 --> 18:00.927
Whoever's shooting...

18:01.001 --> 18:02.764
...call in your position now.

18:03.470 --> 18:06.132
They're going to be swarming this place.
We gotta get out.

18:06.206 --> 18:07.696
Where's Rick? Is he okay?

18:07.774 --> 18:09.366
- He's fine.
- Where is he?

18:09.443 --> 18:11.775
By the water tower.
CTU's sending a chopper.

18:11.845 --> 18:14.143
We got to get out of here now. Hold on.

18:18.785 --> 18:20.844
Okay, come on. It's clear.

18:20.921 --> 18:23.082
We gotta move, we don't have much time.

18:54.287 --> 18:56.812
Hello, Mrs. Vasquez.
Thank you for coming in.

18:56.890 --> 18:59.324
Where's my grandson?
They said I could pick him up.

18:59.392 --> 19:01.883
We'll take you to him.
We want to ask a few questions.

19:01.962 --> 19:03.896
Yes, I have a question, too.

19:04.397 --> 19:06.797
How can a woman bleed to death...

19:07.067 --> 19:09.661
...and nobody does anything about it?

19:12.672 --> 19:15.300
We're sorry about Jamey, Mrs. Vasquez.

19:15.809 --> 19:17.777
But it wasn't like that.

19:19.980 --> 19:22.210
My daughter's dead, isn't she?

19:25.652 --> 19:26.914
Please...

19:27.254 --> 19:28.949
...take me to Kyle.

19:29.055 --> 19:31.455
We really do have to
ask you a few questions.

19:31.525 --> 19:34.085
I'm not interested in your questions.

19:34.160 --> 19:35.627
Mrs. Vasquez.

19:38.231 --> 19:40.062
Your daughter was a traitor.

19:40.934 --> 19:42.094
What?

19:43.270 --> 19:45.500
She confessed before she died.

19:46.673 --> 19:48.732
And if you withhold information...

19:49.276 --> 19:51.301
...you can be held as an accomplice.

19:52.245 --> 19:54.839
If that happens,
who's going to take care of Kyle?

20:06.092 --> 20:08.083
What do you want to know?

20:08.695 --> 20:12.062
IRS records show you earn $45,000 a year.

20:12.532 --> 20:15.160
But an account in your name
shows deposits...

20:15.235 --> 20:17.829
...that add up to more than $300,000.

20:24.477 --> 20:26.104
It's from Jamey...

20:27.781 --> 20:30.375
...so that Kyle would have enough money...

20:30.450 --> 20:31.917
...if something happened to her.

20:32.452 --> 20:33.817
Who gave Jamey the money?

20:37.557 --> 20:39.081
She never said.

20:39.192 --> 20:40.887
And you never asked?

20:40.961 --> 20:42.394
All this money in your account...

20:42.462 --> 20:44.726
...you never once asked
where It came from?

20:48.134 --> 20:49.692
Kyle needs you.

20:51.137 --> 20:53.264
Don't do anything to jeopardize that.

21:01.748 --> 21:05.445
Maxton and Neil, you two
haven't checked in yet. Where are you?

21:06.786 --> 21:09.516
One more time. Maxton and Neil.

21:12.058 --> 21:13.184
This Is Maxton.

21:13.259 --> 21:15.523
Where the hell are you?
Why haven't you called in?

21:15.595 --> 21:18.063
Crossing the creek
to meet Peterson's group.

21:18.131 --> 21:20.224
Trying to cut Bauer off
from the service road.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.359
Not if you keep telling me
where you are.

21:22.435 --> 21:23.868
Give me the Palm Pilot.

21:23.937 --> 21:26.303
Neil's the only one
who hasn't called in.

21:26.373 --> 21:29.069
Maxton, what area was Neil patrolling?

21:29.476 --> 21:31.637
The northeast side of the creek.

21:31.711 --> 21:33.542
He split off on his own.

21:33.980 --> 21:36.141
Okay. They're coming from over there.

21:36.316 --> 21:38.409
We can hit the road down a little farther...

21:38.485 --> 21:40.385
...avoid them completely. Come on.

21:47.861 --> 21:50.261
Maureen? Don't make me get hotel security.

21:50.330 --> 21:52.264
I know you're in there.

22:02.208 --> 22:03.937
Why are you shutting me out?

22:04.010 --> 22:07.446
Because I think we've pretty much said
everything we need to say.

22:07.514 --> 22:09.448
Can I at least come in?

22:11.951 --> 22:13.612
Maureen, please...

22:13.820 --> 22:16.118
...open the door and let me in.

22:24.731 --> 22:26.289
I know I asked you to...

22:26.366 --> 22:30.200
...back off the story about my son,
but I've changed my mind.

22:33.339 --> 22:35.136
Dr. Ferragamo's dead.

22:38.712 --> 22:41.476
- You already knew.
- I don't want to hear any more, Senator.

22:41.548 --> 22:43.880
What do you mean? You've been...

22:43.950 --> 22:45.247
I've left the network.

22:45.618 --> 22:48.109
What? When?

22:48.588 --> 22:50.852
You should leave it alone, too.

22:50.924 --> 22:52.551
That's my advice.

22:53.093 --> 22:54.492
As a friend.

22:56.396 --> 22:57.988
They got to you.

22:59.332 --> 23:01.129
Did they pay you off?

23:01.901 --> 23:04.529
Because I wouldn't have thought
you were for sale.

23:13.213 --> 23:15.204
They threatened you, too.

23:16.716 --> 23:19.844
- I'll see that you're protected.
- I've already protected myself.

23:19.919 --> 23:23.184
You're withholding evidence
in a capital crime.

23:23.256 --> 23:24.518
What evidence?

23:24.591 --> 23:26.456
Dr. Ferragamo is dead.

23:27.427 --> 23:29.452
His files have been destroyed.

23:29.529 --> 23:32.054
The paper from the hospital
with my son's handwriting?

23:32.132 --> 23:34.225
There is no piece of paper.

23:35.702 --> 23:37.101
Not anymore.

23:38.705 --> 23:40.570
There's still my word.

23:40.774 --> 23:42.708
That counts for something.

23:43.143 --> 23:45.236
That's not enough, Senator.

23:46.780 --> 23:48.771
Not against these people.

23:53.419 --> 23:54.750
I'm sorry.

24:27.159 --> 24:28.353
There's no radio.

24:28.427 --> 24:30.088
Bauer's been listening...

24:30.629 --> 24:32.722
...to every damn word!

24:35.500 --> 24:38.435
Mrs. Vasquez received
two wire transfers since January...

24:38.503 --> 24:39.970
...both from a holding company...

24:40.038 --> 24:42.131
...called Luca Univox based In Belgrade.

24:42.207 --> 24:44.698
Jack thought there might be
a connection to Belgrade.

24:44.776 --> 24:46.767
He was on assignment there two years ago.

24:46.845 --> 24:48.210
Did you check his mission files?

24:48.280 --> 24:50.373
Was there a connection
to the hit on Palmer?

24:50.449 --> 24:53.213
These new files may give us a new angle.

24:53.285 --> 24:55.617
So, who do we know in Belgrade...

24:55.687 --> 24:58.622
...who's keyed into
the financial community?

25:02.661 --> 25:03.719
Come on.

25:15.540 --> 25:16.837
Can you call them?

25:17.676 --> 25:20.702
Maybe. Chopper should
have been here by now.

25:21.346 --> 25:23.678
What about Rick?
Isn't he supposed to meet us here?

25:23.982 --> 25:25.711
Damn it. No signal.

25:26.184 --> 25:27.776
Rick was wounded.

25:27.853 --> 25:31.550
He's waiting in the water tower.
When the chopper arrives, he'll come out.

25:31.623 --> 25:33.784
- So what are we waiting for?
- Kim.

25:33.859 --> 25:35.554
Shouldn't he know that we're here?

25:35.627 --> 25:37.595
As soon as your father says it's okay.

25:37.696 --> 25:39.163
There's no one even around.

25:39.231 --> 25:40.596
- Dad...
- Kim, no!

25:40.665 --> 25:42.690
Get back!

25:50.142 --> 25:51.803
It's a sniper rifle.

25:51.877 --> 25:53.071
Then what do we do?

25:54.212 --> 25:55.236
Stay here.

25:55.313 --> 25:57.076
Don't move for anything but the chopper.

25:57.149 --> 25:59.083
Not for anything, you understand me?

25:59.151 --> 26:00.243
Where are you going?

26:00.318 --> 26:01.376
He wants me.

26:01.453 --> 26:02.715
No, Jack!

26:38.657 --> 26:41.091
He's trying to draw us
away from the women.

26:41.259 --> 26:43.955
That's fine by me.
Once he's dead, they'll be easy.

26:44.229 --> 26:45.753
I'll keep him pinned down.

26:46.665 --> 26:49.463
Circle around until you get a clear shot.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.007
Damn it.

27:30.075 --> 27:31.372
That's right, Jack.

27:31.710 --> 27:34.508
You don't have a shot from that distance.

27:38.550 --> 27:40.609
How much longer do we have?

27:40.685 --> 27:42.050
Until what?

27:44.890 --> 27:46.983
Until your people get here.

27:47.092 --> 27:50.027
I wouldn't wait around
to find out if I were you.

27:50.095 --> 27:51.960
I don't have a choice.

27:52.063 --> 27:54.861
People I work for made that pretty clear.

29:10.609 --> 29:13.442
The DA's inside. You want me to sit in?

29:17.515 --> 29:19.142
Give me a minute.

29:20.585 --> 29:21.643
Sir?

29:21.886 --> 29:23.183
It's okay.

29:23.254 --> 29:25.154
He's with the campaign.

29:29.527 --> 29:31.722
The DA's down the hall, Carl...

29:31.796 --> 29:34.230
...waitng for me to tell a story.

29:35.533 --> 29:36.864
It's over.

29:37.068 --> 29:39.969
And I think it's just getting started.

29:43.174 --> 29:45.642
Don't get stupid on me now, David.

29:45.744 --> 29:47.712
Seems I've been stupid for a long time.

29:47.779 --> 29:49.679
Then open your eyes for once.

29:50.382 --> 29:51.576
This...

29:52.083 --> 29:54.449
The whole thing, it's one big machine...

29:54.519 --> 29:57.420
...and I'm the oil that
keeps the pistons pumping...

29:57.489 --> 29:59.548
...the motor turning, the wheels spinning...

29:59.624 --> 30:01.023
Not anymore.

30:01.660 --> 30:04.060
I like you, David, I really do...

30:04.129 --> 30:06.461
...and I think that you
would make one hell of a...

30:06.531 --> 30:08.431
...commander-In-chief.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.000
I know what you did to Ferragamo.

30:11.736 --> 30:13.863
Every engine produces waste.

30:14.572 --> 30:16.767
It's the physics of the situation.

30:17.609 --> 30:20.703
- Listen to yourself.
- Consider the alternatives.

30:20.779 --> 30:25.182
A year from now, you'll either be promoting
your agenda for the nation...

30:25.250 --> 30:27.582
...or visiting your son in prison.

30:28.153 --> 30:30.314
A jury will believe that it was an accident.

30:30.388 --> 30:33.152
I'm not talking about the rapist, David.

30:34.159 --> 30:36.491
I'm talking about Dr. Ferragamo.

30:38.296 --> 30:40.560
The kid didn't have anything to do
with Ferragamo.

30:40.632 --> 30:42.156
Of course he didn't.

30:42.233 --> 30:46.499
But If somebody
were to mention the word "arson"...

30:52.077 --> 30:53.601
Son of a bitch!

30:55.947 --> 30:57.812
You planted something?

30:58.149 --> 31:00.743
The people we both work for, David...

31:01.052 --> 31:03.748
...they know how to get what they want.

31:13.341 --> 31:14.603
Hi, Mike.

31:22.683 --> 31:24.651
What was that all about?

31:30.725 --> 31:32.920
The DA is waiting in there.

31:33.361 --> 31:35.454
What do you want me to say?

31:37.732 --> 31:39.461
Tell him I'm sorry.

31:40.735 --> 31:42.566
I have nothing to say.

31:42.970 --> 31:44.597
I made a mistake.

31:45.106 --> 31:46.835
I don't understand.

31:47.642 --> 31:49.974
I'm running for president, Mike.

31:51.979 --> 31:53.776
And I'm going to win.

32:27.348 --> 32:29.179
Hey, over here!

32:39.660 --> 32:41.218
Mom, wait.

32:52.707 --> 32:56.336
Federal agent! Drop your weapon!
Put your hands in the air!

32:57.378 --> 32:59.005
- Mrs. Bauer?
- Yes!

32:59.080 --> 33:02.777
Hands down. Are you all right?
Do you two need medical attention?

33:02.850 --> 33:04.340
We're fine, but my husband...

33:04.418 --> 33:06.511
- Where is he?
- Somewhere up there.

33:06.587 --> 33:08.748
Go! Come on.

33:15.429 --> 33:16.760
Stay back.

33:17.898 --> 33:19.923
- Kim!
- Mrs. Bauer, wait!

33:20.868 --> 33:21.926
Kim!

33:25.106 --> 33:26.630
Kimberly, stop!

33:31.679 --> 33:32.941
Dad said he'd be in here.

33:33.014 --> 33:34.504
- I know.
- Where is he?

33:34.582 --> 33:36.311
Wherever he is, they'll find him.

33:37.318 --> 33:39.878
- What if Gaines' men found him first?
- He'd be dead...

33:39.954 --> 33:42.946
...and they'd be carrying him
out of here in a body bag.

33:43.024 --> 33:45.754
No, he's got to be around here somewhere.
I got to find him.

33:45.826 --> 33:47.521
No, stop it, Kimberly.

33:47.595 --> 33:49.408
I know you care about this boy...

33:49.608 --> 33:51.463
but I need you to be
here for me right now...

33:51.532 --> 33:54.365
...and your Dad needs both of us
to be there for him.

34:49.790 --> 34:51.553
You're losing blood.

34:54.929 --> 34:57.659
Not enough to stop me from killing you.

34:59.467 --> 35:01.765
Maybe neither of us has to die.

35:04.438 --> 35:05.871
Like I said, Jack...

35:05.940 --> 35:07.931
...I don't have that choice.

35:10.778 --> 35:13.941
Maybe at least you could tell me
what's going on.

35:24.892 --> 35:28.191
Cofell. He mentioned something
about Belgrade.

35:28.829 --> 35:32.196
That was a military operation.
How's Palmer connected to that?

35:32.566 --> 35:35.034
You were there, Jack. You should know.

35:35.102 --> 35:36.763
Let's say I don't.

35:52.620 --> 35:54.087
Neither do I.

35:54.155 --> 35:56.089
The less I know, the better I work.

35:56.157 --> 35:58.216
That's just the nature of our business.

36:05.599 --> 36:08.432
And why did you bring my family into this?

36:09.870 --> 36:12.202
That might have been a mistake.

36:13.340 --> 36:15.672
They wanted to make it personal.

36:20.314 --> 36:21.679
Who's they?

36:23.417 --> 36:26.045
Put down the weapon, Mr. Gaines.

36:26.187 --> 36:27.916
We can protect you.

36:30.791 --> 36:32.281
No, you can't.

36:35.563 --> 36:37.326
Put down the weapon!

36:46.106 --> 36:47.300
Good luck.

37:01.689 --> 37:03.714
Federal agent! Drop your weapon!

37:03.891 --> 37:06.223
Interlace your fingers behind your head!

37:08.195 --> 37:10.459
Sir, we have Bauer In custody.

37:10.931 --> 37:13.161
We also have another man down.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.698
Bring Bauer to the landing zone right away.

37:16.070 --> 37:17.970
Roger, bringing him in.

38:07.529 --> 38:09.190
- Sweetheart?
- Jack!

38:10.499 --> 38:12.364
Thank God you're okay!

38:18.707 --> 38:20.368
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

38:20.442 --> 38:22.376
This nightmare's finally over, right?

38:22.444 --> 38:23.809
Yes, I promise.

38:26.315 --> 38:27.805
Agent Bauer...

38:27.883 --> 38:29.043
...chopper's waiting.

38:29.117 --> 38:32.211
My family's been through hell.
I want them with me.

38:32.287 --> 38:34.380
- That'll be fine. Come on.
- Okay.

38:34.790 --> 38:36.758
Sweetheart, put this on.

40:08.784 --> 40:12.242
Jack and his family were rescued.
They'll be here in 10 minutes.

40:16.024 --> 40:17.184
That's good news.

40:17.259 --> 40:20.558
We need to move on something else.
A lead we got from Jamey's mom.

40:20.629 --> 40:23.530
- Find out where the money came from?
- Offshore bank account.

40:23.599 --> 40:26.363
- We back-traced the funds to Belgrade...
- Wait. Belgrade?

40:26.435 --> 40:29.962
Before I lay it out, you need to upgrade
the threat assessment on Palmer.

40:30.038 --> 40:31.938
You need to give me
more than that...

40:32.007 --> 40:33.998
The same account shows
a transfer of funds...

40:34.076 --> 40:36.340
...to an assassin based in Belgrade.

40:36.411 --> 40:38.811
That's old news.
The photographer at the breakfast.

40:38.880 --> 40:43.112
No. Our contact over there says
this assassin left Yugoslavia this morning.

40:43.185 --> 40:45.517
Which means he's probably already here.

40:47.189 --> 40:49.214
- A second hitter.
- Mm-hmm.
