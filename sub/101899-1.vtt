You
heard that singing?

00:49.466 --> 00:53.603
That was me, singing my
favorite song, "Yes, I Know."

00:54.972 --> 00:57.440
It's the song my wife
and I fell in love to.

01:02.780 --> 01:05.482
And these are some of the
places where we fell in love.

01:12.389 --> 01:14.058
New York is such
a magical place.

01:15.592 --> 01:17.427
You feel like
anything can happen.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.363
We fell in love in winter,

01:20.397 --> 01:22.599
so it's my favorite
time of the year.

01:24.802 --> 01:28.873
I fell for the most beautiful
woman I ever met, Barbara.

01:31.441 --> 01:33.410
I'm the luckiest
guy in the world.

01:48.192 --> 01:50.027
Here's the place
I sometimes work.

01:54.765 --> 01:55.900
This is where I live.

01:58.668 --> 02:00.670
And these are my best friends.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.940
As you can see,
they're glamorous.

02:04.674 --> 02:06.543
These are my parents.

02:06.576 --> 02:08.012
You know what those are like.

02:12.149 --> 02:13.751
These are the
people I care about.

02:15.452 --> 02:17.721
They're special,
just like New York.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.096
This is my son Chris.

02:25.129 --> 02:25.997
I'm proud of him.

02:28.866 --> 02:30.902
And this is Barbara.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.570
Isn't she something?

02:38.475 --> 02:39.911
I'm James.

02:39.944 --> 02:43.981
Oh, I forgot to say,
we got divorced.

02:45.249 --> 02:48.551
But I'm still in love with
her, and I want her back.

02:49.754 --> 02:51.421
I want her back bad.

02:52.722 --> 02:54.457
Love, repeat.

02:55.558 --> 02:56.193
Get it?

03:27.892 --> 03:29.060
With dating, the main thing

03:29.093 --> 03:31.528
you have to do is
criticize her slightly

03:31.561 --> 03:34.265
and compliment her immediately.

03:34.298 --> 03:37.134
It confuses them, then
they can't resist you.

03:38.535 --> 03:42.706
And remember, we're both
geeks, but with a sexy edge.

03:42.739 --> 03:44.541
That's my boy.

03:51.916 --> 03:53.583
Ho ho ho.

03:53.616 --> 03:55.786
It really puts me
in the holiday mood.

03:57.922 --> 03:59.522
This place is fancy.

04:00.291 --> 04:02.692
I've never been to a
rare book room before.

04:03.626 --> 04:04.862
You're in publishing?

04:04.895 --> 04:06.563
And you work for a bank.

04:06.596 --> 04:09.033
Yeah, I could never get
a loan myself, though.

04:09.066 --> 04:10.301
Bad credit.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.702
Shh, I won't tell
"Money Magazine."

04:14.305 --> 04:15.638
Do you have children?

04:15.672 --> 04:17.241
One. Leandra.

04:17.274 --> 04:18.175
She's just like me.

04:18.209 --> 04:20.978
She tells the truth,
even when she shouldn't.

04:21.012 --> 04:22.847
Oh, I wish she'd
go into politics.

04:24.081 --> 04:29.086
James, I hope
you'll excuse me.

04:30.221 --> 04:32.589
My sister tells me I
have a lot of opinions.

04:32.622 --> 04:35.292
She tells me you shouldn't
judge people right away.

04:35.326 --> 04:36.961
You should get to know
them a few minutes.

04:36.994 --> 04:39.562
And I have to tell you,

04:39.596 --> 04:42.632
I don't find you attractive.

04:44.734 --> 04:46.203
Physically.

04:46.237 --> 04:47.704
Oh, that's okay.

04:48.339 --> 04:50.241
I get that a lot.

04:52.910 --> 04:54.278
Really?

04:54.311 --> 04:55.112
Yeah.

04:55.146 --> 04:56.347
It's okay.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.580
Okay.

04:57.614 --> 04:58.249
Whew.

04:59.350 --> 05:00.985
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

05:01.018 --> 05:01.919
Yeah.

05:01.952 --> 05:02.820
Yeah, you don't have to...

05:02.853 --> 05:03.921
You can relax now.

05:03.954 --> 05:05.289
- Okay.
- We can just-

05:05.322 --> 05:06.223
- Well, yeah.

05:06.257 --> 05:08.025
Like read a book or something,

05:09.626 --> 05:10.327
- if you feel like reading.
- I don't really, like, read.

05:14.365 --> 05:16.333
Aced that one.

05:16.367 --> 05:18.668
But it's hard to compare
anyone to Barbara.

05:20.971 --> 05:23.340
She's sort of like
Helen of Troy to me.

05:38.089 --> 05:38.989
See what I mean?

05:40.291 --> 05:42.059
It explains the Trojan War.

05:53.070 --> 05:54.271
All right, sweet one,

05:54.305 --> 05:58.909
Daddy will get you to school
despite his existential angst.

05:58.943 --> 06:00.044
Last minute rehearsal.

06:05.349 --> 06:06.383
Love you.

06:07.751 --> 06:08.718
Thanks, James.

06:08.752 --> 06:10.054
I can always count on you.

06:16.427 --> 06:17.660
How are you doing?

06:22.466 --> 06:24.935
Dad, I don't know
how much longer

06:24.969 --> 06:27.838
I can take this
amicable divorce thing.

07:28.499 --> 07:30.100
No, just no.

07:30.134 --> 07:32.436
I'm sorry, Chad, I've
let you down again.

07:32.469 --> 07:34.305
You cannot be in
love with your ex-wife.

07:34.338 --> 07:35.705
That's got to stop now.

07:36.473 --> 07:38.075
You're gonna take the
Chad's Ladies Challenge.

07:38.108 --> 07:39.310
Seven ladies in seven days.

07:39.343 --> 07:40.511
You've already been
on the first one.

07:40.544 --> 07:44.782
Yeah, but will I
survive the next six?

08:00.431 --> 08:02.166
Look at you.

08:02.199 --> 08:06.770
James, just so handsome
after all these years.

08:07.905 --> 08:12.276
You were always just
such a lovely, nice guy.

08:12.309 --> 08:13.911
- Thank you, thank you.
- Yeah.

08:13.944 --> 08:16.046
And you were
always a lovely lady.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.515
Well, I'm kicking
myself a little bit,

08:19.917 --> 08:24.488
you know, that I didn't
scoop you up back then.

08:24.521 --> 08:26.223
We live and we learn.

08:26.257 --> 08:28.359
Well, very nice of you to say.

08:28.392 --> 08:29.426
And how is your business?

08:29.460 --> 08:30.294
You have that...

08:31.395 --> 08:32.296
No longer.

08:32.329 --> 08:34.031
- No longer.
- Oh.

08:34.064 --> 08:36.533
It's okay. There was just a
bit of an embezzlement issue.

08:36.567 --> 08:38.469
Somebody embezzled
in your company?

08:38.502 --> 08:42.339
I did, and I was
just, you know,

08:42.373 --> 08:45.342
sorta stuck in the
apartment for a bit,

08:45.376 --> 08:49.446
but that is the past
and we're here now.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.814
You and I are here now.

08:50.848 --> 08:53.984
So what's your schedule
like these days?

08:54.852 --> 08:56.186
Um.

09:01.058 --> 09:02.826
Barbara's dating Frank?

09:02.860 --> 09:03.861
- Check.
- And I've passed on

09:03.894 --> 09:06.030
seven names to James.

09:06.063 --> 09:07.398
Now, they can both move on.

09:08.565 --> 09:12.436
How did we get
so smart and sexy?

09:13.637 --> 09:16.140
My ex-wife
is dating another man.

09:17.007 --> 09:19.176
Well, I always like a challenge.

09:19.209 --> 09:22.212
I don't know, Chad, maybe
I'm no good at dating.

09:22.246 --> 09:25.582
Ugh! All you need
is confidence, like me.

09:26.650 --> 09:27.918
What do you do?

09:29.086 --> 09:31.855
I write a blog,
on relationships.

09:31.889 --> 09:33.557
- Oh, wow.
- Mm.

09:33.590 --> 09:36.360
I'm an editor of
literary fiction.

09:36.393 --> 09:38.562
Oh, wow.

09:38.595 --> 09:39.997
Tell me about your work.

09:40.030 --> 09:42.466
Oh, well, my
latest post was about

09:42.499 --> 09:44.635
how men often expect women

09:44.668 --> 09:47.404
to do all the work
in a relationship.

09:47.438 --> 09:51.275
They think, you know, women
are just gonna make it happen.

09:51.308 --> 09:54.111
But if they don't
step up to the plate,

09:55.546 --> 09:57.614
they could wind up losing
the love of their life.

09:58.916 --> 10:00.284
Have you ever experienced that?

10:02.953 --> 10:07.524
Oh, and this isn't happening.

10:09.593 --> 10:13.897
Sometimes, when
life gets too complicated,

10:13.931 --> 10:15.199
I take long walks.

10:16.433 --> 10:17.434
Do you ever do that?

10:18.969 --> 10:22.039
I go back to places Barbara
and I went together,

10:22.072 --> 10:24.575
the top of the Empire
State Building,

10:25.442 --> 10:27.478
a boat ride around Manhattan,

10:28.712 --> 10:32.883
that little French restaurant
in the village we both love.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.888
But remembering isn't
gonna bring her back.

10:39.323 --> 10:42.960
My question is, what will?

10:49.299 --> 10:50.934
Oh, thank goodness
you've come.

10:50.968 --> 10:52.636
- What's wrong?
- Where is my suitcase?

10:52.669 --> 10:54.071
It's on the top shelf

10:54.104 --> 10:56.640
- behind the blankets.
- What happened?

10:56.673 --> 10:58.041
Your father is moving out.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.176
- What?
- Are you sure you didn't

10:59.209 --> 11:02.179
- throw it out?
- I'm not demented, yet!

11:02.212 --> 11:03.947
Your father has decided

11:03.981 --> 11:06.250
that he isn't getting
what he needs with me,

11:06.283 --> 11:08.152
that maybe there's
another woman out there

11:08.185 --> 11:09.620
that's better for him.

11:09.653 --> 11:10.954
- Well, good luck to him.
- What are you talking about?

11:10.988 --> 11:12.222
Nothing.

11:12.256 --> 11:14.558
Nothing. It's time you
found another woman.

11:18.128 --> 11:19.663
Well, go!

11:19.696 --> 11:20.697
Oh, you've got it.

11:30.407 --> 11:32.009
I was only flirting
with that sales girl.

11:32.042 --> 11:33.710
Why did I ever marry you?

11:33.744 --> 11:36.013
I must have lost my mind!

11:36.046 --> 11:38.682
Because I make life
interesting for you, Lavanya.

11:38.715 --> 11:41.753
You wouldn't want me to
be like James, would you?

11:41.786 --> 11:42.653
Who wants reliable?

11:42.686 --> 11:45.022
I would.

11:45.055 --> 11:47.357
You're having an affair!

11:47.391 --> 11:49.660
Lavanya, I could
never cheat on you.

11:49.693 --> 11:54.698
Besides, that sales girl
had slightly crooked teeth.

11:57.267 --> 11:59.002
I'm like Barbara.

12:00.571 --> 12:01.972
I want a divorce.

12:05.509 --> 12:07.444
My
parents are separating,

12:08.445 --> 12:10.147
my best friends are breaking up.

12:14.051 --> 12:15.385
Nice of them to remind me.

12:17.488 --> 12:21.625
It all makes me
remember my own divorce.

12:24.161 --> 12:27.664
"Go to the library
if you want more"?

12:27.698 --> 12:28.499
More.

12:29.801 --> 12:32.102
A scavenger hunt.

12:32.135 --> 12:34.037
This is fun!

12:34.071 --> 12:34.705
Wait, okay.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.374
J.

12:37.407 --> 12:38.275
Yeah.

12:38.308 --> 12:39.109
K.

12:39.142 --> 12:40.511
Getting it.

12:40.544 --> 12:41.813
- L.
- Uh-huh.

12:41.846 --> 12:43.080
Oh!

12:53.190 --> 12:58.195
"Great Literary Editors of
the 19th Century Volume Two."

12:58.863 --> 13:00.097
And it's signed by the author.

13:00.130 --> 13:01.498
It's a first edition.

13:01.532 --> 13:03.033
It completes our collection.

13:03.868 --> 13:04.735
This is it?

13:04.769 --> 13:06.503
Uh-huh.

13:06.537 --> 13:09.072
For our 10th
wedding anniversary?

13:09.106 --> 13:10.107
Yeah.

13:10.842 --> 13:12.276
Can't believe this, James,

13:12.309 --> 13:13.544
this is what I've
been talking about.

13:13.577 --> 13:15.479
What
have I done wrong now?

13:15.512 --> 13:16.747
Well,
it's not just this.

13:16.781 --> 13:19.216
I mean, last year, it
was a gift certificate.

13:19.249 --> 13:21.285
She says
I don't understand her.

13:21.318 --> 13:24.555
And you're thinking that
maybe somehow this is symbolic.

13:24.588 --> 13:25.757
She
says I'm not in touch

13:25.790 --> 13:26.758
- with my feelings.
- "Why is she getting

13:26.791 --> 13:27.558
so emotional?"

13:27.591 --> 13:29.092
What's wrong with
being rational?

13:29.126 --> 13:29.961
She's right.

13:29.994 --> 13:31.194
Can't we just talk
about it calmly?

13:31.228 --> 13:32.764
When is love rational?

13:32.797 --> 13:35.299
And, James, listen,

13:36.868 --> 13:41.171
a wise man once said, "To
love someone is to know them."

13:43.206 --> 13:44.641
Do you remember this ring?

13:44.675 --> 13:47.210
You gave it to me, when you
asked me to get married.

13:49.212 --> 13:51.816
When you're ready to
know me, really know me,

13:51.849 --> 13:53.851
give this ring back to
me and we can start over.

13:53.885 --> 13:55.185
Barbara.

13:58.422 --> 14:01.258
And that's how
it ended, with a simple word.

14:03.393 --> 14:04.227
"Goodbye."

14:06.831 --> 14:07.731
Time to move on,

14:09.867 --> 14:12.837
even though that's the
last thing I want to do.

14:16.306 --> 14:17.842
Hi.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.242
Thanks for having us over.

14:24.348 --> 14:25.883
I'd like you to meet Frank.

14:25.917 --> 14:27.284
This is Frank.

14:28.719 --> 14:30.354
Young, handsome, and rich.

14:31.722 --> 14:33.223
I haven't got a chance.

14:37.862 --> 14:42.466
Mom, I don't understand
why you and Dad got divorced.

14:42.499 --> 14:44.501
You match, like
those little people

14:44.534 --> 14:45.903
on top of the wedding cake.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.139
First, our marriage
worked and then it didn't.

14:50.507 --> 14:52.709
Sometimes, even good
people can't make it work.

14:54.611 --> 14:59.249
I helped Dad get ready for
a date, but I made a mistake.

14:59.282 --> 15:02.219
That can happen to great minds.

15:02.252 --> 15:03.487
You two belong together,

15:03.520 --> 15:06.456
and I'm going to do
something about it,

15:06.490 --> 15:09.226
despite that Frank
guy I've heard about.

15:14.564 --> 15:15.565
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.735
I'm pregnant and I'm drinking.

15:18.770 --> 15:20.570
Please don't judge.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.878
Well, the only person
I judge is myself.

15:26.911 --> 15:27.912
Aw.

15:29.246 --> 15:31.214
I'm your new neighbor.

15:31.248 --> 15:33.951
I met this cute guy,
Chad, in the hallway,

15:33.985 --> 15:36.319
and he said to introduce myself.

15:36.353 --> 15:37.922
Don't worry, I'm single.

15:39.556 --> 15:42.426
Is it just me, or do you smell
an instant attraction here?

15:42.459 --> 15:44.796
You can stop by anytime.

15:44.829 --> 15:47.631
I work from home selling
beauty products online,

15:47.664 --> 15:49.934
and there's always an
open bottle of Merlot,

15:49.967 --> 15:51.668
and Adele on my playlist.

15:51.702 --> 15:52.536
Oh, she's my favorite.

15:52.569 --> 15:53.905
Mm. Mm.

15:53.938 --> 15:55.238
Mm.

15:55.272 --> 15:57.474
Chad said you have a son.

15:57.507 --> 15:59.309
I am ready to babysit anytime.

15:59.342 --> 16:00.912
I love kids.

16:00.945 --> 16:02.746
Did I mention I'm pregnant?

16:05.382 --> 16:06.249
♪ Hello ♪

16:10.320 --> 16:12.322
I got to
get rid of this app.

16:15.392 --> 16:16.426
Come on in, Dad.

16:16.460 --> 16:17.962
Make yourself at home.

16:17.995 --> 16:18.896
Home?

16:18.930 --> 16:21.331
This is not my home.
I've got a sleeping bag.

16:21.364 --> 16:23.300
I've got a football.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.302
Oh, and a small room to boot.

16:27.437 --> 16:32.309
It's all sinking in, all
of those years of marriage.

16:32.342 --> 16:34.277
And I'm moving in
with my grown son.

16:34.311 --> 16:36.013
What is wrong with me?

16:36.047 --> 16:39.316
You're welcome to stay
as long as you need to.

16:39.349 --> 16:40.785
I don't want to be in the way.

16:40.818 --> 16:41.853
You're not in the way.

16:41.886 --> 16:43.620
Chris and I want you here.

16:44.721 --> 16:45.990
We love you, Dad.

16:47.491 --> 16:48.358
Thank you, son.

16:51.095 --> 16:52.696
We'll need to talk
about what to do

16:52.729 --> 16:54.966
when I bring ladies
home at night.

17:05.475 --> 17:06.878
I think I got you, son.

17:09.412 --> 17:12.784
I think you're on
the road to death.

17:12.817 --> 17:13.885
Really? Really?

17:13.918 --> 17:15.019
- Mm-hm.
- You think that?

17:15.052 --> 17:16.653
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.

17:16.686 --> 17:18.756
Well, what about this?

17:20.357 --> 17:21.793
What do you say to that?

17:21.826 --> 17:24.095
You play a passive game, son.

17:24.128 --> 17:25.529
That just won't cut it.

17:25.562 --> 17:27.031
Okay. All right.

17:27.064 --> 17:30.367
In fact, you're
living your love life

17:30.400 --> 17:32.069
like it's a chess game.

17:33.436 --> 17:35.039
If you want to win Barbara
back, you've got to-

17:35.072 --> 17:37.975
- Dad, she has a boyfriend.

17:38.009 --> 17:40.878
Remember? Mr. Chiseled Jawline?

17:40.912 --> 17:43.513
So he's handsome,
in good shape,

17:43.547 --> 17:46.050
has millions because he
runs a hedge fund, so what?

17:46.083 --> 17:47.684
You've got good qualities too.

17:47.717 --> 17:49.887
I'm trying to remember
my good qualities.

17:49.921 --> 17:54.691
Look, imagine this, you're
in a shotgun formation,

17:54.724 --> 17:57.094
you drop back, take
the snap, roll right,

17:57.128 --> 17:59.997
toss a dart downfield
to your wide receiver

18:00.031 --> 18:01.132
who's running a post pattern,

18:01.165 --> 18:05.970
he catches the ball in
stride, and bingo, six points.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.504
You follow?

18:07.537 --> 18:11.741
Dad, football and I are
not on speaking terms.

18:15.079 --> 18:16.580
Do you love her, James?

18:23.855 --> 18:24.688
Yeah.

18:25.756 --> 18:26.891
Do you want her back?

18:28.793 --> 18:29.626
Yeah.

18:33.164 --> 18:34.664
Then get off your duff.

18:42.572 --> 18:44.075
Make Barbara jealous,

18:44.108 --> 18:45.776
then she'll come
running back to you.

18:45.810 --> 18:48.511
Right, that always works.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.547
Now that Lavanya's gone,

18:50.580 --> 18:52.415
I'm gonna have to
start dating again.

18:54.218 --> 18:55.485
What are you wearing?

18:56.653 --> 18:58.923
We've got to give
you a man makeover.

20:16.834 --> 20:19.937
What, are you going
to a costume party?

20:19.971 --> 20:20.871
It's almost Christmas.

20:20.905 --> 20:22.974
Halloween was two months ago.

20:23.007 --> 20:24.674
Thanks for the
confidence-building,

20:24.708 --> 20:27.577
and thanks for getting
together again.

20:29.013 --> 20:31.715
I always did have a
self-destructive streak.

20:31.748 --> 20:34.118
So what do you want to do?

20:35.319 --> 20:37.587
So how's yours?

20:37.620 --> 20:40.557
Romantic and uplifting.

20:40.590 --> 20:41.926
How's yours?

20:41.959 --> 20:43.194
Otherworldly.

20:43.227 --> 20:44.661
Takes me to another place.

20:47.131 --> 20:49.033
And this is still not happening.

21:02.146 --> 21:04.181
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:04.215 --> 21:05.282
Sorry to bother you at work.

21:05.316 --> 21:06.183
That's okay.

21:06.217 --> 21:08.019
- Do you have a second?
- Something wrong?

21:08.052 --> 21:11.922
Well, yeah,
we need a new babysitter.

21:11.956 --> 21:13.758
Olga is pregnant.

21:13.791 --> 21:15.558
Again?

21:15.592 --> 21:16.861
Okay, it's my turn.

21:16.894 --> 21:18.963
You found the last one.

21:18.996 --> 21:21.564
Maybe this one
could be a nice gay guy?

21:21.598 --> 21:22.767
Oh, okay.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.002
Time to call Manly Mannies.

21:25.036 --> 21:26.337
I know
it's a stereotype,

21:26.370 --> 21:29.672
but often gay men can
express their feelings.

21:29.706 --> 21:32.343
Oh, right, the
famous feelings.

21:32.376 --> 21:34.779
Well, I'm still
searching for mine.

21:34.812 --> 21:37.580
And it
wouldn't hurt, James,

21:37.614 --> 21:41.052
I mean, Chris to learn
a little compassion.

21:42.219 --> 21:44.654
What exactly are you
trying to say here?

21:45.823 --> 21:47.224
You
know what I mean.

21:47.258 --> 21:48.092
Yeah, I do.

21:48.125 --> 21:50.327
Unfortunately, I do
know what you mean.

21:50.361 --> 21:51.796
- I do.
- Sorry for the slip-up.

21:51.829 --> 21:53.297
- I just, I'm-
- That's okay.

21:53.330 --> 21:55.665
Sort
of in a hurry and-

21:55.698 --> 21:58.769
- Well, you know, I was hoping
we could talk for a minute.

22:01.638 --> 22:02.540
I got to go.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.141
But listen, I'll see
you on Saturday, right?

22:04.175 --> 22:06.643
- Okay.
- Can I pick Chris up at six?

22:06.676 --> 22:08.112
Yeah, yeah. That's good.

22:08.145 --> 22:09.313
That's good.

22:09.346 --> 22:11.748
- Thank you, James.
- Okay, sure.

22:11.782 --> 22:14.318
Sure. Maybe we can
talk again later.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.687
Yes, we will
definitely talk again later.

22:17.720 --> 22:18.721
- Okay.
- Okay.

22:18.756 --> 22:19.356
Okay.

22:19.390 --> 22:20.623
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:29.100 --> 22:30.633
Hi, I'm Donny.

22:32.203 --> 22:33.971
Your Manly Manny?

22:34.004 --> 22:34.839
Come on in.

22:41.912 --> 22:44.747
Just curious, how
do you identify?

22:47.017 --> 22:48.185
Gay.

22:48.219 --> 22:49.220
Uh-huh.

22:49.253 --> 22:50.888
And/or fluid.

22:50.921 --> 22:53.390
Fluid. You mean,
like, hydrated?

22:55.025 --> 22:55.926
Right.

22:59.830 --> 23:03.934
Chris is 11, smart,
and a little sarcastic.

23:03.968 --> 23:06.337
Then Chris and I
will get along great.

23:07.471 --> 23:09.706
What's your favorite sport?

23:09.739 --> 23:11.242
Basketball.

23:11.275 --> 23:12.243
Book?

23:12.276 --> 23:13.643
"The Underground Railroad."

23:14.711 --> 23:16.981
Do you like girls?

23:17.014 --> 23:17.848
Yes.

23:19.817 --> 23:21.952
I can tell, you've
never babysat before.

23:22.820 --> 23:23.988
Just my brothers.

23:24.021 --> 23:25.823
I need the money
while I'm in school.

23:25.856 --> 23:27.358
What are you studying?

23:27.391 --> 23:28.959
Early medieval
religious history

23:28.993 --> 23:31.328
with an emphasis on
Francis of Assisi.

23:32.363 --> 23:33.197
Cool.

23:34.398 --> 23:35.900
I won't tell Dad that
you don't have a clue

23:35.933 --> 23:38.068
about babysitting or life.

23:48.412 --> 23:50.347
My new blog
writing friend told me

23:50.381 --> 23:53.284
I need an action plan
to get Barbara back.

23:54.485 --> 23:56.820
I need to try something
I've never done before.

24:00.824 --> 24:03.794
Maybe expressing my feelings?

24:11.802 --> 24:14.737
I know you're on deadline,
hence deadline food.

24:15.973 --> 24:18.475
I actually didn't have time
to eat today, so thank you.

24:18.509 --> 24:21.111
Oh, and thank you for
getting the new babysitter.

24:22.246 --> 24:24.515
Does he seem sensitive
and artistic?

24:24.548 --> 24:25.783
Abundantly.

24:25.816 --> 24:27.117
That's what the world needs.

24:28.886 --> 24:29.920
What's that?

24:29.954 --> 24:30.788
Flowers.

24:32.790 --> 24:34.758
You've never given
me flowers before.

24:43.367 --> 24:44.335
Camilla called.

24:44.368 --> 24:49.206
Ooh, I love women
chasing men, it's so zesty.

24:49.240 --> 24:52.009
I'm still in
love with Barbara.

24:52.042 --> 24:56.880
James, don't let love
interfere with romance.

24:59.950 --> 25:00.884
You called.

25:00.918 --> 25:01.485
I did.

25:01.518 --> 25:02.453
You actually called.

25:02.486 --> 25:03.887
I did.

25:03.921 --> 25:04.989
I was surprised
when you called.

25:05.022 --> 25:06.156
Were you really?

25:06.190 --> 25:06.991
I was surprised.

25:07.024 --> 25:07.891
Why?

25:07.925 --> 25:11.562
I wasn't sure...

25:11.595 --> 25:13.564
I thought you didn't like me.

25:13.597 --> 25:15.266
No, I like you fine.

25:15.299 --> 25:17.234
I just don't find you sexy.

25:17.268 --> 25:18.402
Ah.

25:18.435 --> 25:20.738
Apparently, my ex-wife
agrees with you.

25:21.939 --> 25:24.375
You're not supposed to
talk about past relationships

25:24.408 --> 25:25.476
until the third date.

25:26.610 --> 25:28.279
This is a date?

25:28.312 --> 25:31.348
I decided I should give
guys who read a chance.

25:32.383 --> 25:35.586
I'm trying to focus on
what's most important.

25:35.619 --> 25:37.488
What's that?

25:41.558 --> 25:46.130
A man who is solvent,
who won't cheat on me,

25:46.163 --> 25:49.967
and who I can depend
on in any situation.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.872
Basically, I'm looking
for a man who's boring.

25:56.340 --> 25:57.408
You're perfect.

25:58.575 --> 26:00.978
Maybe I'm no good
at relationships.

26:01.011 --> 26:03.213
Oh, I'm not looking
for a relationship.

26:03.247 --> 26:04.848
I'm looking for a husband.

26:08.886 --> 26:10.421
Mm-hm.

26:10.454 --> 26:11.288
Mm-hm.

26:13.324 --> 26:14.491
I can work with that.

26:17.061 --> 26:19.263
Ugh, men are such children.

26:20.497 --> 26:22.866
Seriously, they're like little
Peter Pans skipping around

26:22.900 --> 26:24.034
in their little green tights.

26:25.235 --> 26:26.537
I mean, don't they
realize that eventually

26:26.570 --> 26:27.571
we're all going to die?

26:27.604 --> 26:28.605
I don't think they do.

26:28.639 --> 26:29.606
Exactly.

26:29.640 --> 26:32.576
The male ego is so
fragile, it's exhausting.

26:34.078 --> 26:36.146
Chad thinks that if he
dates a younger woman,

26:36.180 --> 26:38.415
he'll magically become her age.

26:38.449 --> 26:40.317
James's father too.

26:40.351 --> 26:41.518
Hm.

26:41.552 --> 26:44.955
Now it's different when women
date younger, we live longer.

26:44.988 --> 26:48.959
It makes evolutionary sense
for us to date younger men.

26:48.992 --> 26:50.160
I didn't go after Frank.

26:50.194 --> 26:51.362
He came after me.

26:51.395 --> 26:52.496
Of course.

26:52.529 --> 26:56.300
He's an intelligent, gorgeous,

26:56.333 --> 26:58.335
sexy hunk of a man.

26:59.603 --> 27:02.373
My god, in those photos, his
abs look like the Himalayas,

27:02.406 --> 27:06.176
all those peaks and valleys.

27:10.314 --> 27:13.517
Tell me, what's he
like in the bedroom?

27:16.620 --> 27:17.955
Mm-hm.

27:17.988 --> 27:19.289
And that's all
I needed to know.

27:30.968 --> 27:33.537
Frank helped me out with my
math homework the other day.

27:33.570 --> 27:35.606
Are you going to
keep dating him?

27:35.639 --> 27:36.940
Do you like him?

27:37.975 --> 27:38.976
He's okay.

27:40.644 --> 27:44.948
While Frank was watching me,
Dad tried to have a date.

27:44.982 --> 27:46.250
Oh?

27:46.283 --> 27:48.218
It was pretty much
like his cooking

27:48.252 --> 27:49.386
from what I could tell.

27:51.588 --> 27:53.390
What does that mean?

27:53.424 --> 27:56.460
Mom, we both know
what that means.

28:08.405 --> 28:10.441
New York
is my kind of town.

28:11.742 --> 28:12.543
Mine.

28:15.479 --> 28:18.148
I know eight million
people feel the same way.

28:20.384 --> 28:22.453
All these impressive buildings,

28:24.354 --> 28:25.522
all this energy,

28:28.258 --> 28:30.994
all these diverse and
fascinating people,

28:33.664 --> 28:35.199
it's like nowhere else.

28:40.471 --> 28:42.005
So why is it harder for people

28:42.039 --> 28:45.108
to stay together here
than anywhere else?

28:47.344 --> 28:48.178
You're hot.

28:49.580 --> 28:50.380
You're hotter.

28:51.582 --> 28:54.218
Then I guess we're an
impossibly hot couple.

28:54.251 --> 28:56.720
People probably hate
us for showing off.

28:59.256 --> 29:00.090
Hey.

29:01.793 --> 29:03.761
I feel silly for
bringing this up...

29:04.728 --> 29:06.396
What?

29:06.430 --> 29:09.700
I was cleaning out the
closet and I found a bra.

29:13.136 --> 29:14.738
We talked about this.

29:14.772 --> 29:16.039
I'm bi, I'm fluid.

29:16.073 --> 29:17.441
Whatever I am,

29:17.474 --> 29:18.375
- that's what I am.
- Or is that just your way

29:18.408 --> 29:19.777
of sleeping with more people?

29:21.578 --> 29:22.780
How do you think
this makes me feel?

29:26.083 --> 29:27.384
Jay.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.486
Jay, listen to me,
it's not that I-

29:29.520 --> 29:30.621
- I'm listening,

29:30.654 --> 29:34.057
and what I hear you saying
is "I don't know who I am."

29:35.526 --> 29:36.761
Jay.

29:36.794 --> 29:38.028
Jay!

29:39.764 --> 29:41.131
How was your day?

29:41.164 --> 29:41.799
Good.

29:43.768 --> 29:44.601
What'd you do?

29:46.236 --> 29:49.139
Just hung out with Mom.

29:49.172 --> 29:51.441
Oh, okay. How's she doing?

29:51.475 --> 29:52.309
Good.

29:53.845 --> 29:54.678
Okay.

30:00.117 --> 30:01.385
I was just wondering...

30:01.418 --> 30:02.754
Uh-huh?

30:02.787 --> 30:04.588
Why do people fall in love?

30:05.790 --> 30:06.824
Oh.

30:06.858 --> 30:11.128
Well, all kinds of reasons.

30:11.161 --> 30:12.830
There are different
theories about it.

30:12.864 --> 30:14.698
What do you think?

30:14.731 --> 30:17.501
Well, I think
people are looking

30:17.534 --> 30:18.669
to find meaning in their lives,

30:18.702 --> 30:22.139
and falling in love is one
of the best ways to do that.

30:23.507 --> 30:26.176
Why do people
fall out of love?

30:27.812 --> 30:31.783
All kinds of reasons and,
often, it's nobody's fault.

30:31.816 --> 30:36.620
You and Mom, Grandma and
Grandpa, does everybody break up?

30:38.422 --> 30:40.591
Maybe love isn't worth it.

30:40.624 --> 30:42.359
It is worth it, Chris.

30:43.527 --> 30:45.329
It'll happen for you someday.

30:46.430 --> 30:48.833
Dad, I love you.

30:48.866 --> 30:50.835
I love you too, Chris.

30:50.868 --> 30:54.404
And I promise I'm never going
to fall out of love with you,

30:54.438 --> 30:56.506
no matter what happens.

30:56.540 --> 30:57.341
Okay?

31:01.913 --> 31:06.884

thought of thinking ♪

31:07.684 --> 31:11.188

31:57.802 --> 32:00.203
Careful, Dad,
we're both expressing

32:00.237 --> 32:02.506
some serious emotion here.

32:03.941 --> 32:04.741
Yeah.

32:06.510 --> 32:07.310
Yeah.

32:26.363 --> 32:28.365
Thanks for calling, Barbara.

32:28.398 --> 32:29.599
I've missed you.

32:29.633 --> 32:31.234
I've wanted to
know how you are.

32:32.269 --> 32:32.937
How's the single life?

32:33.971 --> 32:34.972
Wonderful.

32:35.006 --> 32:35.840
Great.

32:37.474 --> 32:38.508
How's Amanda?

32:40.310 --> 32:41.645
She says she's all right.

32:44.015 --> 32:46.750
You know, I've been thinking,

32:47.952 --> 32:51.288
we got married just
out of college.

32:51.956 --> 32:53.323
We had James.

32:54.926 --> 32:56.560
Life happened really fast.

32:59.030 --> 33:01.398
We've been together
our whole lives.

33:04.334 --> 33:07.304
It's been good, mostly.

33:08.973 --> 33:10.440
But I keep thinking about

33:11.876 --> 33:15.278
what if I had made different
choices along the road?

33:16.580 --> 33:21.351
I can't help wondering if maybe
I've missed out in some way.

33:22.652 --> 33:25.355
Or maybe you have something
everyone else wants.

33:31.896 --> 33:35.699
Philip said I could get
rid of things in his closet.

33:35.732 --> 33:40.303
Maybe James or you
could use some of these.

33:40.337 --> 33:41.371
Thanks.

33:42.339 --> 33:43.540
James will be home soon.

33:47.111 --> 33:49.881
I don't know you
very well, Donny,

33:49.914 --> 33:54.417
but you seem like a very
nice young man, so does Jay.

33:55.853 --> 33:57.889
Do you fight much?

33:57.922 --> 33:58.923
Not so far.

33:59.857 --> 34:02.359
I mean, we have some
stuff we're working out,

34:03.127 --> 34:05.395
but we're gonna
be fine, I think.

34:06.563 --> 34:09.432
Neither of us have any money,
but we have each other.

34:09.466 --> 34:10.835
Mostly, we feel very lucky.

34:11.769 --> 34:13.070
I'm happy for you both.

34:14.038 --> 34:17.108
It's funny, Phillip
and I have everything

34:17.141 --> 34:21.745
they tell you to have, a
bank account for emergencies,

34:21.779 --> 34:26.784
plenty of money put away for
retirement, a nice apartment.

34:27.384 --> 34:27.785
We're set.

34:28.786 --> 34:30.755
So why don't I feel lucky?

34:40.097 --> 34:45.102
Not even jewelry,
diamonds, emeralds, anything?

34:45.970 --> 34:48.605
You call this a reconciliation?

34:49.807 --> 34:52.109
But I bought you
expensive chocolates.

34:52.143 --> 34:54.111
With a note that says,

34:54.145 --> 34:56.680
"To Chad, with much love.

34:56.713 --> 35:01.585
From Haley, your little girl
in the maroon linen jumpsuit.

35:01.618 --> 35:03.353
XOXO."

35:04.521 --> 35:05.622
Did you write that?

35:07.124 --> 35:08.358
That's so sweet.

35:09.293 --> 35:11.494
I don't want your
girlfriend's chocolates!

35:13.463 --> 35:15.066
She admires me from afar.

35:15.099 --> 35:16.366
How far?

35:17.434 --> 35:20.071
Lavanya, as you know,

35:20.104 --> 35:22.139
I come from a very
privileged family,

35:23.440 --> 35:26.777
albeit it was also
strangely disadvantaged.

35:28.145 --> 35:29.579
I never got enough attention.

35:30.547 --> 35:32.149
Where are you going with this?

35:33.217 --> 35:34.484
I get lonely, Lavanya.

35:35.719 --> 35:36.888
While both of us have a myriad

35:36.921 --> 35:38.488
of other central opportunities-

35:38.521 --> 35:39.422
- We do.

35:39.456 --> 35:43.861
We're both comparatively young

35:43.895 --> 35:47.932
and undeniably attractive.

35:47.965 --> 35:51.568
Well, not everything
you say is a lie.

35:52.535 --> 35:53.838
Irregardless of whatever

35:54.972 --> 35:57.174
mistakes either one
of us have made,

35:57.208 --> 35:59.977
I do feel it's best
that we're together.

36:00.011 --> 36:03.680
If anything, when
we have children,

36:03.713 --> 36:05.950
they'll be very,
very good-looking.

36:07.051 --> 36:07.952
Huh?

36:07.985 --> 36:09.053
Hm?

36:09.086 --> 36:09.921
What?

36:11.822 --> 36:13.224
You want children?

36:13.257 --> 36:14.491
Do I?

36:15.159 --> 36:16.894
I just assumed you did.

36:16.928 --> 36:18.528
Oh, god.

36:19.263 --> 36:20.664
So typical.

36:30.875 --> 36:34.744
Manhattan is
an island, just like me.

36:36.546 --> 36:40.450
Both of us have energy and
activities swirling around us.

36:43.653 --> 36:45.790
Times Square is the
heart of New York,

36:46.991 --> 36:50.227
but its heart is cold like mine.

36:52.797 --> 36:54.098
But how do we get it warm?

36:56.700 --> 36:58.069
By letting someone in?

36:59.569 --> 37:01.738
Or by letting something out?

37:04.809 --> 37:06.811
This is
my daughter Leandra.

37:06.844 --> 37:08.545
Nice to meet you.

37:11.315 --> 37:12.817
She's beautiful.

37:12.850 --> 37:14.785
I don't have
any childcare today.

37:14.819 --> 37:17.021
My daddy's a really hot dude.

37:21.225 --> 37:23.127
I'm not really a dude.

37:23.160 --> 37:26.097
We know. James, it's
painfully obvious.

37:32.336 --> 37:36.573
James, I've been thinking...

37:36.606 --> 37:37.241
Oh.

37:37.274 --> 37:38.909
Why do I feel dubious?

37:40.577 --> 37:42.579
I've gotten used to your
lack of steaming passion.

37:42.612 --> 37:43.414
Thank you.

37:43.447 --> 37:45.049
I think we should
become exclusive.

37:46.817 --> 37:47.451
Ignore her.

37:49.086 --> 37:51.554
Camilla, I have to tell you,

37:52.722 --> 37:56.260
I think I'm still in
love with my ex-wife.

37:56.293 --> 37:57.862
Well, that's never
gonna work out.

37:57.895 --> 37:59.096
She's way too classy.

38:00.597 --> 38:01.999
You should stick
with Leandra and me.

38:02.033 --> 38:03.733
We'll work with
your shortcomings.

38:11.308 --> 38:13.978
Adults, right?

38:14.011 --> 38:14.845
They can't help it.

38:16.613 --> 38:19.150
They just don't know
what they're doing.

38:19.183 --> 38:20.284
Tell me about it.

38:22.987 --> 38:24.587
You want to go on a date?

38:24.621 --> 38:26.157
There's a walking tour
of Upper Manhattan

38:26.190 --> 38:28.125
where they study
different rock formations.

38:28.159 --> 38:30.627
Tempting, but since
our parents are dating,

38:30.660 --> 38:33.798
wouldn't that make things
interpersonally complex?

38:40.037 --> 38:42.239
How long did Dad say
he was gonna be gone?

38:43.174 --> 38:44.208
Two hours.

38:45.376 --> 38:47.744
Your babysitter
had a love crisis.

38:48.779 --> 38:50.948
God, I can relate.

38:52.116 --> 38:54.085
You look like you've
had a lot of those.

38:56.120 --> 39:00.357
Look, kid, this can
be a pleasant experience

39:00.391 --> 39:02.659
or an unpleasant one.

39:02.692 --> 39:06.197
And remember, your father is
most likely going to believe

39:06.230 --> 39:10.301
my version of the story,
so which one's it gonna be?

39:12.735 --> 39:14.105
Jay and I had a bad fight.

39:17.341 --> 39:19.376
What if he can't accept
everything that I am?

39:21.412 --> 39:23.214
I don't know if I
can accept myself.

39:26.417 --> 39:27.918
Jay's a lucky guy.

39:30.687 --> 39:31.688
Sometimes, life sucks.

39:33.224 --> 39:34.058
Yeah.

39:35.459 --> 39:37.660
Sometimes, life sucks.

39:41.265 --> 39:43.234
How was your day?

39:43.267 --> 39:44.667
Good.

39:44.701 --> 39:47.404
You know, working on
living in the moment.

39:47.438 --> 39:48.272
Wow.

39:49.406 --> 39:53.144
I love those yoga
pants, and I love you.

39:54.311 --> 39:55.146
Frank.

39:56.147 --> 39:56.981
Seriously.

39:58.115 --> 39:58.949
I love you.

40:00.284 --> 40:01.986
And I love you.

40:02.019 --> 40:02.853
Wow.

40:04.188 --> 40:05.923
First time saying that.

40:05.956 --> 40:07.424
Well, it's a big step.

40:09.726 --> 40:11.829
Speaking of living
in the moment,

40:14.398 --> 40:16.333
why don't we get married?

40:16.367 --> 40:17.201
What?

40:18.502 --> 40:21.272
When are we tying the knot?

40:21.305 --> 40:22.139
Now.

40:23.073 --> 40:23.974
Today?

40:26.076 --> 40:27.111
This weekend.

40:34.351 --> 40:35.286
- Frank.
- Hm?

40:36.453 --> 40:37.720
You just proposed
to me in the bathroom.

40:37.755 --> 40:38.756
I didn't plan on it.

40:38.789 --> 40:39.490
I can see that.

40:39.523 --> 40:40.858
Sorry.

40:46.964 --> 40:49.300
I heard Barbara's engaged.

40:51.502 --> 40:52.303
Sorry, guy.

40:53.404 --> 40:56.739
I thought you wanted me
to be a player like you.

40:56.774 --> 41:01.744
Oh, it's exciting, sure,
but it's a lonely game, James.

41:02.546 --> 41:04.481
How's your dad's love life?

41:04.515 --> 41:08.751
Well, he keeps claiming
he wants to start dating.

41:08.786 --> 41:09.787
Go, Dad.

41:09.820 --> 41:11.989
But mostly, he
watches football

41:12.022 --> 41:14.724
and thinks about calling Mother.

41:15.793 --> 41:17.361
It's harder for her.

41:18.829 --> 41:20.030
Woo!

41:20.064 --> 41:22.299
I'm loving the single life!

41:23.467 --> 41:24.802
She's a delicate flower.

41:25.903 --> 41:28.172
Well, with this separation,

41:28.205 --> 41:30.474
she's going to
need time to heal.

41:30.507 --> 41:34.211
I might sell everything
I own and move to Alaska.

41:35.579 --> 41:36.947
Yeah.

41:36.981 --> 41:41.385
Set up my own human
genome testing service.

41:41.418 --> 41:43.020
How hard could it be?

41:44.388 --> 41:46.790
I wouldn't be surprised
if she delves deeper

41:46.824 --> 41:48.859
into her religious faith.

41:48.892 --> 41:53.897
♪ O'er the land of the free ♪

41:55.299 --> 41:58.936
♪ And the home of the brave ♪

42:03.507 --> 42:04.508
Yeah.

42:21.058 --> 42:21.892
Mom?

42:26.530 --> 42:29.033
It's all gonna be okay.

42:31.935 --> 42:36.140
There's a letter in the
top drawer of my desk.

42:36.173 --> 42:39.176
It tells you everything I want.

42:39.209 --> 42:41.578
Mom, try not to talk.

42:46.350 --> 42:49.186
I have just one
regret in life.

42:51.422 --> 42:55.826
When I was young, I didn't
know I was beautiful.

42:57.961 --> 43:01.965
Maybe if I'd known that, my
life would have been different.

43:06.303 --> 43:08.505
Don't live the way I did, James.

43:09.640 --> 43:11.842
Live with your heart open.

43:13.177 --> 43:14.445
I love you, Mom.

43:16.280 --> 43:17.915
I love you too, son.

43:22.519 --> 43:25.589
The doctor says all your
tests came back negative.

43:25.622 --> 43:26.590
You were dehydrated.

43:26.623 --> 43:28.025
You're going to be fine.

43:29.360 --> 43:30.427
Shit.

43:31.595 --> 43:33.530
Why do you have to
ruin everything?

43:33.564 --> 43:36.200
This was supposed to
be my death scene.

44:14.037 --> 44:14.671
Hello?

44:17.241 --> 44:18.075
Hello?

44:51.208 --> 44:52.042
Okay.

44:52.777 --> 44:55.979
Do you want me to zip you up?

44:56.013 --> 44:57.648
It's okay, I got it.

45:00.017 --> 45:00.984
Mm.

45:01.018 --> 45:02.052
What?

45:02.085 --> 45:03.287
You don't like my dress?

45:04.221 --> 45:05.289
You look beautiful.

45:06.657 --> 45:08.225
Thanks for doing this.

45:08.258 --> 45:09.660
Frank hates these things.

45:09.693 --> 45:11.562
Plus, he had to work
late on that deal

45:11.595 --> 45:12.663
he's putting together.

45:14.031 --> 45:15.165
Oh, is my hair coming down?

45:15.199 --> 45:16.033
No.

45:18.469 --> 45:20.437
I dropped Chris
off at your mother's.

45:20.471 --> 45:23.340
And Dad's staying with
Uncle Jeff in Albany.

45:23.373 --> 45:25.676
So we don't have to worry
about how late we stay.

45:25.709 --> 45:28.345
All the donors are going
to be pretty mature,

45:28.378 --> 45:31.081
but the food is gonna be great,

45:31.114 --> 45:33.383
and there's dancing and a band.

45:33.417 --> 45:35.118
Who knows, we might
even have fun.

45:41.391 --> 45:42.794
Are you up for dancing?

45:42.827 --> 45:46.363
You know that was
never my long suit.

45:46.396 --> 45:48.365
I feel like I'm
in middle school.

45:48.398 --> 45:49.600
Oh!

45:49.633 --> 45:50.467
Come on, it's simple.

45:50.501 --> 45:51.335
Come here.

45:56.406 --> 45:57.541
Nice cologne.

45:57.574 --> 45:59.076
Thanks.

45:59.109 --> 46:00.677
Frank gave it to me.

46:00.711 --> 46:03.080
So there are many
different kinds of steps.

46:03.113 --> 46:04.581
Mm-hm.

46:04.615 --> 46:05.783
But what you really have to
do is just shift your weight

46:05.817 --> 46:07.618
back and forth
from foot to foot.

46:07.651 --> 46:08.685
Okay.

46:08.719 --> 46:10.287
You can try it.

46:12.256 --> 46:15.325
And this is the arm that
you use to sorta guide me-

46:15.359 --> 46:18.095
- Mm-hm.
- 'Cause you're leading.

46:18.128 --> 46:21.198
♪ To follow you around ♪

46:21.231 --> 46:22.399
Who's that singing?

46:22.432 --> 46:25.102
Oh, that's the Merlot
woman down the hall.

46:25.135 --> 46:28.739
Oh, her.

46:28.773 --> 46:30.274
♪ It's all a mystery ♪

46:30.307 --> 46:32.175
She's singing our song.

46:32.209 --> 46:33.677
Chris taught it to her.

46:36.246 --> 46:39.216
♪ But I know how
much I love you ♪

46:39.249 --> 46:41.853
♪ Yes, I know ♪

46:41.886 --> 46:44.388
Hey, look, you're dancing.

46:45.522 --> 46:46.356
See?

46:47.825 --> 46:49.593
Nothing to it.

46:49.626 --> 46:50.460
Right.

46:51.595 --> 46:52.764
Nothing to it.

46:53.664 --> 46:56.333
♪ Yes, it's you ♪

48:38.468 --> 48:39.436
James.

48:43.240 --> 48:47.210
Chris is waiting for you
to take him to school.

49:07.698 --> 49:09.366
That's a nice dress.

49:11.301 --> 49:12.636
What's Chris gonna think?

49:13.905 --> 49:16.440
He's gonna think his
parents slept together.

49:18.675 --> 49:21.846
Well, did you?

49:21.879 --> 49:23.280
We had a lot to drink.

49:23.948 --> 49:24.949
I don't remember.

49:26.683 --> 49:29.419
In my day, you knew
when you slept with a man.

49:33.124 --> 49:38.228
Barbara, I've always liked
you, as much as I like anyone,

49:39.296 --> 49:42.767
but your divorce
wasn't all about James.

49:42.800 --> 49:43.734
What do you mean?

49:45.469 --> 49:49.306
I know James has trouble being
in touch with his feelings.

49:49.339 --> 49:50.975
Look at his mother.

49:52.375 --> 49:54.912
But are you really so
in touch with yours?

49:58.448 --> 50:01.718
What exactly do you
feel this morning?

50:45.062 --> 50:49.033
Well, so what
are you gonna do?

50:49.066 --> 50:50.001
I don't know.

50:50.034 --> 50:51.969
Do you have any suggestions?

50:59.676 --> 51:00.443
Sandra.

51:09.153 --> 51:10.922
Did you miss me?

51:14.558 --> 51:15.392
I'm sorry.

51:19.429 --> 51:20.463
I'm with Barbara now.

51:24.634 --> 51:25.468
Lucky woman.

51:31.075 --> 51:32.676
This doesn't happen to me.

51:34.011 --> 51:35.046
No one leaves me.

51:36.013 --> 51:37.447
I'm not trying to hurt you,

51:38.816 --> 51:40.584
and I hope we can
still be friends.

51:41.718 --> 51:43.553
Have you forgotten
how good we are?

51:43.587 --> 51:45.756
But I'm in love
with someone else.

51:48.425 --> 51:49.026
Are you sure?

52:15.152 --> 52:16.153
Ooh.

52:16.187 --> 52:17.855
Everything okay?

52:17.889 --> 52:20.724
You two are getting
married tomorrow.

52:20.758 --> 52:25.395
Ah, the twists and turns of
fate, it's really moving.

52:27.497 --> 52:28.199
Hey, guys.

52:28.232 --> 52:29.967
Speaking of twists and turns.

52:30.935 --> 52:32.469
Chad.

52:32.502 --> 52:33.603
You've returned.

52:33.637 --> 52:36.173
Lavanya, love of my life.

52:38.009 --> 52:40.211
Kneeling with roses?

52:40.244 --> 52:42.179
You've done that already.

52:42.213 --> 52:45.216
Will you please forgive my
wayward ways and take me back?

52:45.249 --> 52:47.785
I promise to have eyes
for you and only you.

52:48.953 --> 52:51.055
Mm.

52:51.088 --> 52:52.455
What?

52:52.489 --> 52:54.158
I'm thinking.

53:00.765 --> 53:01.933
Oh, all right.

53:06.837 --> 53:07.637
Mm.

53:08.839 --> 53:09.974
- Mm.
- Mm-mm-mm.

53:19.582 --> 53:21.518
What do you think?

53:21.551 --> 53:24.255
Zane is the top wedding
wizard in New York.

53:24.288 --> 53:27.191
This dress was featured
in "Vogue" last month.

53:27.224 --> 53:28.725
I hope that doesn't
mean too many women

53:28.759 --> 53:29.961
will be wearing it.

53:29.994 --> 53:31.628
Oh, very few women
have your good taste.

53:33.130 --> 53:34.999
Did I miss something?

53:35.032 --> 53:37.168
I don't remember
becoming engaged.

53:37.201 --> 53:40.171
I remember how shy you
are, and you forgot to ask,

53:40.204 --> 53:43.540
so I'm prompting you.

53:44.641 --> 53:47.644
This is one
option for headgear.

53:47.677 --> 53:48.779
Should I be seeing this?

53:48.813 --> 53:50.181
Isn't that bad luck?

53:50.214 --> 53:51.916
Oh, that's an old
wives tale, darling.

53:51.949 --> 53:54.885
I want you to be happy with
how I look on our special day.

53:54.919 --> 53:58.289
And here is another choice.

53:58.322 --> 53:59.757
Can you see me under here?

53:59.790 --> 54:00.758
You look fabulous.

54:00.791 --> 54:02.093
You look beautiful.

54:03.294 --> 54:04.929
I'm so happy.

54:06.596 --> 54:10.567
Don't worry, I know that Chris
and Leandra will get along

54:10.600 --> 54:12.535
just fine as stepkids.

54:12.569 --> 54:15.906
We'll be one big, somehow
functional family.

54:17.074 --> 54:19.709
I will remember
this day forever.

54:19.743 --> 54:21.511
It's the best day of my life.

54:23.881 --> 54:24.782
Oh, my god.

54:25.749 --> 54:26.984
I'm very excited.

54:27.018 --> 54:29.220
Oh, god, Zane, I am
so happy you're here.

54:29.253 --> 54:31.822
- Absolutely.
- Oh, god, happy, happy!

54:36.193 --> 54:37.194
- Oh.
- Okay.

54:39.230 --> 54:40.197
Mm.

54:41.065 --> 54:42.133
Thank you.

54:42.166 --> 54:43.234
I should go.

54:43.267 --> 54:44.168
- Okay.
- All right, darling?

54:44.201 --> 54:45.635
All right, baby. All right.

54:45.668 --> 54:46.871
I'm gonna leave this with you.

54:46.904 --> 54:47.972
- Oh, yes, we have to choose.
- All right.

54:48.005 --> 54:49.206
Okay.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.074
All right.

55:04.321 --> 55:06.689
- I think we should-
- Camilla.

55:06.723 --> 55:10.961
You are a lovely, lovely...

55:10.995 --> 55:15.366
I can't tell you what
a lovely woman you are.

55:15.399 --> 55:18.735
You know, maybe this
isn't a good time.

55:18.769 --> 55:20.271
What?

55:20.304 --> 55:21.638
You know, timing.

55:21.671 --> 55:24.175
I read somewhere
timing is everything.

55:24.208 --> 55:27.211
We should time it, time
it so it's really good.

55:28.312 --> 55:30.314
You might want to, you
know, get out of...

55:30.347 --> 55:32.049
Is that returnable?

55:43.693 --> 55:44.528
Oh, hi.

55:44.562 --> 55:46.297
I saw Camilla running
down the street,

55:46.330 --> 55:47.664
sobbing in a wedding dress.

55:47.697 --> 55:48.766
Yeah, we broke up.

55:48.799 --> 55:50.935
Yeah, I kinda figured.

55:50.968 --> 55:53.337
So you're on the market again.

55:53.370 --> 55:55.239
You're selling, I'm buying.

55:55.272 --> 55:58.109
Yeah, but I'm thinking of
taking a break from dating,

55:58.142 --> 55:59.642
maybe permanently.

55:59.676 --> 56:00.377
Oh, what a loss.

56:00.411 --> 56:01.644
Yeah, I've got the guys

56:01.678 --> 56:02.446
- coming over.
- And Barbara's getting

56:02.480 --> 56:04.081
- married tomorrow.
- Yeah, yeah.

56:04.115 --> 56:05.682
- We're having a party.
- I mean, like, in 12 hours.

56:05.715 --> 56:07.384
She asked me to invite
you to the wedding.

56:07.418 --> 56:09.053
- Really?
- Yeah.

56:09.086 --> 56:10.988
Oh, I should say I'm
busy, but I'd love to go.

56:11.021 --> 56:12.089
Where's she getting married?

56:12.123 --> 56:13.190
The Colonial Dames.

56:13.224 --> 56:14.358
- Ooh, fancy.
- Yeah.

56:14.391 --> 56:15.860
- Fancy.
- That historic organization,

56:15.893 --> 56:17.027
they rent their clubhouse.

56:17.061 --> 56:18.162
Yeah, I've heard them.

56:18.195 --> 56:19.330
Very cool.

56:19.363 --> 56:21.165
It's tomorrow?

56:21.198 --> 56:22.299
OMG.

56:22.333 --> 56:23.234
- Yes.
- What to wear, what to wear?

56:23.267 --> 56:25.002
Barbara does not waste time.

56:25.035 --> 56:26.003
I respect that.

56:26.937 --> 56:31.041
Still, this must be
really not easy for you.

56:31.075 --> 56:32.109
Mm.

56:32.143 --> 56:33.344
Jenny.

56:33.377 --> 56:35.846
Jenny, I've got the
guys coming over.

56:35.880 --> 56:37.448
They're coming over for a party.

56:37.481 --> 56:38.315
Jenny?

56:39.483 --> 56:41.352
This is gonna
be the most epic party ever.

56:41.385 --> 56:42.987
- Thank you.
- All right, gentlemen,

56:43.020 --> 56:45.422
keep it down, keep it
down, keep it down.

56:45.456 --> 56:47.791
Frank is having
his bachelor party,

56:47.825 --> 56:50.161
so I thought we should
have our own party.

56:51.028 --> 56:52.363
Gentlemen, a toast.

56:52.396 --> 56:53.397
Uh-huh.

56:54.965 --> 56:59.702
To my best friend James,
the ultimate good loser.

56:59.736 --> 57:00.604
Hear, hear!

57:00.638 --> 57:01.839
To the good loser!

57:01.872 --> 57:03.073
There you go, James!

57:03.107 --> 57:04.875
You've got to break
out tonight, kid.

57:04.909 --> 57:06.343
You're gonna get a chance.

57:06.377 --> 57:07.178
You're gonna get...

57:07.211 --> 57:08.946
Oh, you're gonna
get a chance too.

57:08.979 --> 57:09.780
Music!

57:09.813 --> 57:11.048
"YMCA" or "Macarena"?

57:11.081 --> 57:12.883
Neither, my friend.

57:12.917 --> 57:15.953
We are gonna bust
out our best hip hop.

57:15.986 --> 57:17.388
All right, all right, all-

57:17.421 --> 57:18.489
Wow!

57:18.522 --> 57:21.724
- Good going, Chris!
- All right, guys.

57:24.028 --> 57:24.995
And two.

57:25.029 --> 57:25.930
And three.

57:25.963 --> 57:27.898
And four. And then hips.

57:27.932 --> 57:28.966
Yes, James.

57:28.999 --> 57:29.900
Come on.

57:29.934 --> 57:30.968
Do your hips move at all, James?

57:31.001 --> 57:31.969
I don't know.

57:32.002 --> 57:33.204
Can you feel it?

57:33.237 --> 57:34.438
- Feel it with me.
- Feel it, James.

57:34.471 --> 57:35.506
- Feel it, James.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

57:35.539 --> 57:37.775
It's a coming out party.

57:37.808 --> 57:39.877
Show that music,
that excitement.

57:39.910 --> 57:41.512
- Move it, man.
- You got it, Dad.

57:41.545 --> 57:42.446
Oh, good going, James.

57:42.479 --> 57:44.114
Get that jacket off.

58:11.575 --> 58:13.777
Ah, got it!

58:13.811 --> 58:15.846
You got it! Oh, yeah!

58:15.879 --> 58:17.781
- Yeah.
- James, let's show it.

58:17.815 --> 58:18.782
Let's show it.

58:19.550 --> 58:21.885
All right, James, you're up.

58:21.919 --> 58:22.987
Move it on up.

58:23.020 --> 58:24.221
- Oh, yes!
- Oh!

58:24.255 --> 58:26.857
Oh, your dancing looks great!

58:29.560 --> 58:31.128
Oh!

58:31.161 --> 58:34.531
The topper, the
topper, the topper!

58:34.565 --> 58:36.267
Chad, oh, wow! Oh!

58:37.268 --> 58:38.102
Oh, geez.

58:40.271 --> 58:41.071
All right.

59:10.634 --> 59:14.038
Tonight was one of the
trials on your hero's journey.

59:14.071 --> 59:15.939
You've come through the fire

59:15.973 --> 59:18.008
and now you're one
step closer to the goal

59:18.042 --> 59:21.145
of achieving raised consciousness
and your full manhood.

59:22.413 --> 59:24.048
You're almost there.

59:24.081 --> 59:26.984
Then, you can attain
life's highest purpose.

59:29.286 --> 59:31.221
What's that?

59:34.425 --> 59:35.826
The heck if I know.

59:40.364 --> 59:43.867
My mother taught me

59:43.901 --> 59:47.271
that I have to live
with my heart open.

59:49.006 --> 59:50.874
And your mother said to me

59:52.443 --> 59:56.980
that to love someone
is to know them.

59:59.016 --> 1:00:01.885
You got to call your
mother on the phone

1:00:01.919 --> 1:00:04.655
and tell her to
meet me on the roof.

1:00:04.688 --> 1:00:07.591
Dad, what are
you talking about?

1:00:07.624 --> 1:00:09.960
I think you've had a little
bit too much to drink.

1:00:09.993 --> 1:00:11.595
I'm going.

1:00:11.628 --> 1:00:13.097
Oh, god.

1:00:39.323 --> 1:00:40.591
Hello?

1:00:40.624 --> 1:00:42.960
Mom, come quickly.

1:00:42.993 --> 1:00:44.194
Dad's going to the roof.

winter finds a way ♪

- James.

1:01:26.637 --> 1:01:27.471
James.

1:01:29.072 --> 1:01:31.074
What are you doing?

1:01:31.108 --> 1:01:32.009
Chris called.

1:01:32.042 --> 1:01:33.377
I didn't know what to think.

1:01:33.410 --> 1:01:34.478
Barbara.

1:01:34.511 --> 1:01:36.146
You came.

1:01:36.180 --> 1:01:37.714
You came. This is for you.

1:01:37.748 --> 1:01:39.383
- Why'd you do all this?
- It's lights.

1:01:39.416 --> 1:01:42.319
- Why?
- Lights like a wedding cake

1:01:42.352 --> 1:01:44.988
because we came up
here so many times,

1:01:45.022 --> 1:01:48.659
and I wanted you to have this
beautiful night one more time

1:01:48.692 --> 1:01:50.627
before you get married tomorrow.

1:01:50.661 --> 1:01:51.562
Yes, tomorrow.

1:01:51.595 --> 1:01:55.399
And I see, I see,

1:01:55.432 --> 1:01:58.735
- and I know you see and know-
- James, this is crazy!

1:01:58.770 --> 1:02:00.704
And I see and I
know, and see all

1:02:00.737 --> 1:02:03.607
- those lights in the sky.
- It's too late!

1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:04.741
- They know-
- It's too late.

1:02:04.776 --> 1:02:06.610
James, listen.

1:02:06.643 --> 1:02:07.578
Listen.

1:02:07.611 --> 1:02:09.012
Hm?

1:02:09.046 --> 1:02:11.748
I am so glad that we
were married for a time,

1:02:14.051 --> 1:02:15.519
but I'm marrying Frank tomorrow,

1:02:15.552 --> 1:02:17.387
and you have to let me go.

1:02:20.524 --> 1:02:22.693
No.

1:02:22.726 --> 1:02:23.560
No.

1:02:35.072 --> 1:02:36.507
Yes, I knew it.

1:02:36.540 --> 1:02:39.343
I knew you two were going
to get back together.

1:02:39.376 --> 1:02:40.677
I'm sorry, Chris,

1:02:41.846 --> 1:02:45.449
your mother and I are
never gonna be together.

1:02:45.482 --> 1:02:47.184
But you and Mom just kissed.

1:02:47.217 --> 1:02:48.820
That was a kiss goodbye.

1:02:48.853 --> 1:02:50.654
- This is your fault, Dad!
- Chris, stop it.

1:02:50.687 --> 1:02:51.722
How come I'm more

1:02:51.756 --> 1:02:52.556
- mature than you are?!
- Stop it.

1:02:53.825 --> 1:02:55.592
It's time you grew up

1:02:55.626 --> 1:02:57.628
so you have time to
live before you die.

1:06:59.736 --> 1:07:02.907
New York has
a special kind of winter.

1:07:02.940 --> 1:07:07.779
It snows, then melts,
then snows again,

1:07:07.812 --> 1:07:09.279
all in the same day.

1:07:10.413 --> 1:07:13.416
After last night, I melted.

1:07:14.651 --> 1:07:15.853
I'm finally open.

1:07:17.021 --> 1:07:21.759
And the irony is Barbara's
about to marry someone else.

1:07:27.765 --> 1:07:28.866
Hello, Zane.

1:07:28.900 --> 1:07:30.101
What are you doing here?

1:07:30.134 --> 1:07:32.036
Studying how not
to do a wedding.

1:07:32.069 --> 1:07:34.337
Apparently,
a wedding means

1:07:34.371 --> 1:07:35.739
dueling wedding planners.

1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:39.543
Philip and I
are back together.

1:07:39.576 --> 1:07:41.779
He lost his mind all over again.

1:07:43.014 --> 1:07:46.516
Mrs. Anderson, what
a beautiful space.

1:07:46.550 --> 1:07:48.351
What a beautiful day.

1:07:49.153 --> 1:07:51.421
Weddings always make me cry.

1:07:51.454 --> 1:07:53.390
Thank goodness
Lavanya's forgiven me.

1:07:54.091 --> 1:07:55.725
Now, all we have to do

1:07:55.760 --> 1:07:59.329
is survive the rest
of our lives together.

1:08:00.497 --> 1:08:03.000
I'm glad you could
make it as my date.

1:08:03.034 --> 1:08:03.968
How's your mom?

1:08:04.001 --> 1:08:07.071
She's already picked
out her next husband.

1:08:07.104 --> 1:08:09.472
The most important thing
is to be with the person

1:08:09.506 --> 1:08:10.875
who makes your heart sing.

1:08:12.109 --> 1:08:13.677
Amanda's my gal.

1:08:15.179 --> 1:08:18.582
Is this wedding
giving you any ideas?

1:08:21.018 --> 1:08:21.853
I do.

1:08:53.550 --> 1:08:55.152
What are you feeling, Barbara?

1:08:55.186 --> 1:08:57.121
I'm really not sure.

1:08:57.154 --> 1:09:00.091
I'm sure you heard
about my deathbed speech.

1:09:00.124 --> 1:09:03.194
I'd take my advice
if I were you.

1:09:03.227 --> 1:09:05.729
Mom, I wanted to tell
you I won't hate you

1:09:05.763 --> 1:09:08.165
for the rest of your
life from marrying Frank.

1:09:08.199 --> 1:09:10.167
I see he's actually an okay guy.

1:09:10.201 --> 1:09:12.136
That's very nice
of you, Chris.

1:09:12.169 --> 1:09:14.471
I'm remarkably
mature for my age.

1:09:15.973 --> 1:09:17.909
Everyone,
come into the dining room!

1:09:18.776 --> 1:09:20.011
Oh. Candice!

1:09:20.044 --> 1:09:21.045
- I just-
- We're starting

1:09:21.078 --> 1:09:22.146
to get smitten!

1:09:22.179 --> 1:09:23.014
But...

1:09:24.782 --> 1:09:25.615
Candice?

1:09:41.531 --> 1:09:42.166
Oh.

1:09:54.946 --> 1:09:55.813
Is that Sandra?

1:09:59.884 --> 1:10:00.851
She's very pretty.

1:10:04.155 --> 1:10:08.525
And even more importantly, I
realize she's my best friend,

1:10:09.794 --> 1:10:11.195
like you and James.

1:10:17.868 --> 1:10:19.103
What are we gonna say,

1:10:20.204 --> 1:10:21.806
about not going through with it?

1:10:26.110 --> 1:10:27.111
The truth.

1:10:31.548 --> 1:10:32.783
Lady has class.

1:10:53.804 --> 1:10:54.738
Something wrong?

1:10:54.772 --> 1:10:56.240
I seem to have lost the groom.

1:11:01.278 --> 1:11:03.247
Let's find somewhere quiet.

1:12:05.142 --> 1:12:07.812
I'm a little overdressed
if I'm not getting married.

1:12:09.679 --> 1:12:10.680
You look beautiful.

1:12:12.416 --> 1:12:13.150
Thank you.

1:12:15.319 --> 1:12:16.287
I'm grateful.

1:12:17.354 --> 1:12:18.655
For what?

1:12:19.390 --> 1:12:24.661
For our sassy son and
our quirky families.

1:12:25.329 --> 1:12:26.163
And our unique friends.

1:12:26.197 --> 1:12:30.000
And for being best
friends for life.

1:12:35.705 --> 1:12:38.741
You said that we
could start again

1:12:40.778 --> 1:12:45.783
when I understood that to
love you is to know you.

1:12:52.823 --> 1:12:53.723
James, have you
been carrying this

1:12:53.757 --> 1:12:55.860
with you this whole time?

1:12:55.893 --> 1:12:56.894
Yes.

1:12:56.927 --> 1:12:59.096
I carry your heart.

1:12:59.130 --> 1:13:00.397
And I'll carry yours.

1:13:16.380 --> 1:13:18.715
I'm confused.

1:13:18.748 --> 1:13:20.451
What happened to
the hedge fund guy?

1:13:20.484 --> 1:13:23.720
Are Barbara and James really
getting married again?

1:13:23.753 --> 1:13:26.991
I think they were
always married.

1:13:27.024 --> 1:13:28.159
Ah.

1:13:31.762 --> 1:13:32.429
Look at all of you guys.

1:13:32.463 --> 1:13:34.465
Well, there may be

1:13:34.498 --> 1:13:37.168
happily ever after after all.

1:13:40.237 --> 1:13:42.873
You can find happiness
the second time around,

1:13:43.774 --> 1:13:45.209
and with the same person.

1:13:47.011 --> 1:13:50.414
The world is often
a crazy place.

1:13:50.447 --> 1:13:53.683
Love is the one thing
that makes sense,

1:13:54.885 --> 1:13:58.222
especially if you
love and love again.

1:14:00.457 --> 1:14:02.793
Love, repeat.
