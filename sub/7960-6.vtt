10:03.458 --> 10:04.657
(giggles)

10:05.927 --> 10:08.395
Coffee, eggs over medium,
fresh-squeezed juice...

10:08.396 --> 10:10.396
and I removed the pulp
with a strainer,

10:10.398 --> 10:13.500
because your perfect little wife
knows how angry you get

10:13.501 --> 10:15.367
when things aren't just so.

10:17.438 --> 10:19.105
All right, what'd you do to it?

10:19.107 --> 10:21.841
Spit in the orange juice,
wipe the toast on the floor?

10:21.843 --> 10:25.611
Nonsense. Why would I ever
do such a thing, husband?

10:26.414 --> 10:28.481
Knock it off.

10:28.483 --> 10:31.517
Have I done something
to displease you, husband?

10:31.519 --> 10:33.319
Quit calling me husband...
it's creepy.

10:34.255 --> 10:35.921
Do you prefer master?

10:35.923 --> 10:37.357
All right, okay.

10:37.358 --> 10:38.925
I see what you're doing.

10:38.926 --> 10:40.326
You're trying
to make me feel guilty

10:40.328 --> 10:41.861
for what I said last night.

10:41.863 --> 10:43.029
If you say so.

10:43.030 --> 10:44.897
The man is always right.

10:47.735 --> 10:50.035
But here's something you didn't
factor in to your little plan.

10:50.037 --> 10:51.438
Probably not.
Yeah.

10:51.439 --> 10:52.739
I'm hungry.

10:52.740 --> 10:53.874
And guess what?

10:53.875 --> 10:55.207
I don't feel bad!

10:55.209 --> 10:58.111
I feel good that there's
a breakfast in front of me.

10:58.112 --> 10:59.912
How's that make you feel?

10:59.914 --> 11:01.448
Well, how do I know how I feel

11:01.449 --> 11:04.416
if you haven't told me
how I feel?

11:04.418 --> 11:06.385
(giggles) Fine.

11:06.387 --> 11:08.588
If that is the way
you want to play it,

11:08.589 --> 11:10.157
let the games begin.

11:10.158 --> 11:12.325
Mmm, cinnamon toast.

11:12.326 --> 11:14.961
Mmm, you probably buttered this
with your shoe,

11:14.962 --> 11:16.530
but it's going down sweet.

11:16.531 --> 11:17.597
(laughs)

11:17.598 --> 11:19.166
You're smart.

11:19.167 --> 11:22.168
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.338
And just know
that when you're finished,

11:25.339 --> 11:27.406
I'll be here ready to make love.

11:29.944 --> 11:31.945
Well, that sounds good to me.

11:31.946 --> 11:33.380
And just like this breakfast,

11:33.381 --> 11:37.082
if you don't think I'm gonna
enjoy it, you are wrong.

11:41.656 --> 11:43.789
Be with you in a minute.

11:49.697 --> 11:51.998
So what did Stepford Molly
pack you for lunch?

11:51.999 --> 11:53.266
(chuckles)

11:53.267 --> 11:55.001
Shaved roast beef on a hoagie,

11:55.002 --> 11:56.770
Mmm.
Fuji apples...

11:56.771 --> 11:58.405
sliced and skinned... ooh.

11:58.406 --> 12:00.940
Plus, Rice Krispie Treat.

12:00.942 --> 12:02.241
Did she use Fruity Pebbles?

12:02.243 --> 12:04.543
She yabb-dabba-did.

12:04.545 --> 12:06.947
And this somehow is supposed
to make you miserable?

12:06.948 --> 12:08.715
Uh, this is a mind game
she's playing.

12:08.716 --> 12:12.518
Unfortunately for her,
this mind don't play it.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.487
So you're gonna outsmart her
by undersmarting her.

12:15.489 --> 12:17.490
Pretty smart, huh?

12:17.491 --> 12:18.558
You-you did it.

12:18.559 --> 12:19.893
I mean, you finally broke
that wild horse.

12:19.894 --> 12:21.260
You got everything you wanted.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.729
Yeah.

12:22.730 --> 12:24.363
(chuckles)

12:29.804 --> 12:31.171
Is something wrong with it?

12:31.172 --> 12:32.372
(sighs softly)

12:32.373 --> 12:33.640
I don't know how she did it.

12:33.641 --> 12:34.674
What?

12:34.675 --> 12:36.877
This is a loveless sandwich.

12:36.878 --> 12:39.546
It tastes of spite
in every bite.

12:39.547 --> 12:41.448
Well, now you're just
being picky.

12:41.449 --> 12:44.551
Do you want food and sex
or do you want love?

12:44.552 --> 12:45.718
Oh.

12:46.554 --> 12:47.654
Ah.

12:47.655 --> 12:49.889
"Have an amazing day, husband."

12:50.691 --> 12:52.492
Wow.

12:52.493 --> 12:54.159
She hates me.

12:59.667 --> 13:01.534
Hey, w-what are you doing
on the couch?

13:01.535 --> 13:04.670
Shouldn't you be packing
Mike's pipe with poison tobacco?

13:06.173 --> 13:07.407
No, I'm done with all that.

13:07.408 --> 13:08.707
Mike saw right through me.

13:08.709 --> 13:10.911
Turns out giving him all
the food and sex he wanted

13:10.912 --> 13:12.712
didn't upset him.

13:12.713 --> 13:15.547
Played me like
a cheap carnival game.

13:16.350 --> 13:17.717
Yeah, I know how you feel.

13:17.718 --> 13:20.986
I once lost six games
of tic-tac-toe to a chicken.

13:22.189 --> 13:24.524
It's not exactly the same Th...

13:24.525 --> 13:27.359
Well, yeah,
it's exactly the same thing.

13:28.162 --> 13:29.863
Hey, you mind if
I set up shop here?

13:29.864 --> 13:32.098
Or is that gonna mess
with your writing mojo?

13:32.099 --> 13:35.267
No, I'm just writing
a stupid snake story.

13:36.003 --> 13:37.803
All I got right now is dialogue.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.942
Well, you know what might help
with your creative constipation?

13:41.943 --> 13:44.977
A little iron in your diet.

13:45.947 --> 13:47.480
Come on, Vince, cut the act.

13:47.481 --> 13:49.214
No one likes ironing.

13:49.216 --> 13:50.583
If you say so.

13:50.584 --> 13:52.785
(humming)

13:58.392 --> 14:00.025
Do you really enjoy that?

14:00.027 --> 14:01.227
I sure do.

14:01.228 --> 14:02.996
And you know what the icing
on the cake is?

14:02.997 --> 14:05.165
The look on your mother's face
when she opens her closet

14:05.166 --> 14:07.434
and sees rows
of freshly-pressed blouses,

14:07.435 --> 14:10.669
pants and age-inappropriate
halter tops.

14:12.273 --> 14:15.407
So you and Botox are the reason
she has no wrinkles.

14:16.544 --> 14:17.944
The man behind the woman.

14:17.945 --> 14:19.913
And when I need my hair dyed,

14:19.914 --> 14:21.648
she's the woman behind the man.

14:21.649 --> 14:24.284
We each pitch in
where we need to.

14:24.285 --> 14:28.855
Yeah, you try not to keep
score, but you always do.

14:28.856 --> 14:32.091
Right now, I'm way in front.

14:41.202 --> 14:43.168
Mikey, what a surprise!

14:43.170 --> 14:45.171
Hungry or you need my toilet?

14:45.172 --> 14:46.306
(chuckles)

14:46.307 --> 14:49.142
Can't a son just come
by and check up on his mother?

14:49.143 --> 14:50.643
Sit down.

14:50.644 --> 14:51.945
I'll warm up
some lasagna for you.

14:51.946 --> 14:53.246
Oh, you don't have to do that.

14:53.247 --> 14:54.581
Corner piece if you got it.

14:54.582 --> 14:55.715
Yeah.

14:55.716 --> 14:57.217
I know my boy.

14:57.218 --> 14:58.618
Yeah, you do.

14:58.619 --> 15:00.220
Can I get you a beer?

15:00.221 --> 15:01.388
Yeah, that'd be nice.

15:01.389 --> 15:03.490
A cold beer after
a long day at work.

15:03.491 --> 15:05.358
Yeah, here you go.

15:05.359 --> 15:07.394
See? How hard is this?

15:07.395 --> 15:08.795
What are you talking about?

15:08.796 --> 15:09.763
Nothing.

15:09.764 --> 15:11.031
I just appreciate the effort.

15:11.032 --> 15:14.167
I'm happy someone's happy
to make me happy.

15:14.168 --> 15:15.268
Of course.

15:15.269 --> 15:16.469
You work hard.

15:16.470 --> 15:19.272
You deserve a beer
and a hot meal.

15:19.273 --> 15:22.675
Careful who you say that around.

15:22.676 --> 15:23.943
Who, your wife?

15:23.944 --> 15:25.345
What, she thinks she's too good

15:25.346 --> 15:27.279
to crack open a beer for my boy?

15:27.281 --> 15:29.848
It's not that she thinks
she's too good to...

15:29.850 --> 15:31.418
Let me tell you something.

15:31.419 --> 15:35.387
Waiting on you should be
the biggest pleasure of her day.

15:35.389 --> 15:37.322
That's a little much.

15:37.324 --> 15:38.925
Nothing's too much for you.

15:38.926 --> 15:43.395
Boy, I tell you, I'd spoil you
rotten if we were married.

15:45.900 --> 15:49.368
You know what, Mom, I'm-I'm
not as hungry as I thought.

15:49.370 --> 15:51.470
In fact, my stomach just turned.

15:52.673 --> 15:53.772
Really?

15:53.774 --> 15:55.041
You don't want anything?

15:55.042 --> 15:58.343
Be more than happy
to run a hot bath for you.

15:59.146 --> 16:02.015
No, no, uh, like I said,
I just came in here

16:02.016 --> 16:03.316
to check on you and...

16:03.317 --> 16:05.718
(chuckles)
I should really run...

16:05.719 --> 16:07.820
very, very far away.

16:09.290 --> 16:14.393
That girl will never appreciate
how much I do for her.

16:18.566 --> 16:19.833
Mol, you out here?

16:19.834 --> 16:21.700
Under the car.

16:21.702 --> 16:23.469
Why?

16:24.405 --> 16:26.638
You're not cutting
my brake lines, are you?

16:26.640 --> 16:28.574
No.

16:28.576 --> 16:30.209
Although I could.

16:31.479 --> 16:34.546
There are online courses that'll
teach you just about anything.

16:36.951 --> 16:38.718
Just to be clear,
you didn't, right?

16:38.719 --> 16:40.253
No.

16:40.254 --> 16:43.823
Though I did change your oil
and swap out your filter

16:43.824 --> 16:45.125
and top off all your fluids.

16:45.126 --> 16:47.025
Molly, you didn't have
to do that.

16:47.027 --> 16:49.329
I mean, it's totally
cool that you did.

16:49.330 --> 16:51.363
But you didn't have to.

16:51.365 --> 16:53.032
I know. I wanted to.

16:53.033 --> 16:55.001
I felt like pitching in,

16:55.002 --> 16:57.604
and I know car stuff is not
the most obvious choice,

16:57.605 --> 17:00.272
but hey, Vince likes ironing.

17:00.274 --> 17:01.975
Well, I gotta say,

17:01.976 --> 17:05.010
you're a lot cuter
than the guy at Valvoline.

17:05.012 --> 17:06.012
Cheaper, too.

17:06.012 --> 17:07.713
I work for dinner.

17:07.714 --> 17:10.983
Well, have you tried
my famous stinky lentil soup?

17:10.984 --> 17:12.885
I have.

17:14.088 --> 17:15.555
Then we should go out.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.189
Yeah, we should.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.959
I'll get my coat.

17:22.762 --> 17:25.231
I am gonna see
if I can figure out

17:25.232 --> 17:27.398
where all these extra parts go.

17:29.103 --> 17:31.003
Or not.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.086
Hey.
Hey.

17:43.087 --> 17:44.988
Look at you.

17:44.989 --> 17:46.255
Writing again.

17:46.257 --> 17:48.225
Kind of.
I'm on a mechanics' forum.

17:48.226 --> 17:49.993
Apparently some of the parts
I threw away

17:49.994 --> 17:51.761
were pretty important.

17:51.762 --> 17:54.498
I wouldn't drive the car over 40

17:54.499 --> 17:56.700
till I get this figured out.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.068
My little Pep Girl.

17:58.069 --> 18:00.036
(sniffs)
Hey, is that dinner I smell?

18:00.037 --> 18:01.104
It is.

18:01.105 --> 18:02.172
You're amazing.

18:02.173 --> 18:04.574
I made a pork loin.

18:04.575 --> 18:06.142
You take off that shirt.

18:06.143 --> 18:08.111
I'm not wasting two hours
and a can of Shout

18:08.112 --> 18:10.679
wrestling pig juice out of that.

18:12.183 --> 18:13.683
Say what you want,

18:13.684 --> 18:16.086
but my mother hit the jackpot
when she married that one.

18:16.087 --> 18:17.987
(chuckles) We all did.

18:19.757 --> 18:21.492
Think he knows anything
about cars?
