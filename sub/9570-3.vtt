00:55.370 --> 00:57.050
Maddie!

00:57.065 --> 00:59.500
Fucking turn it down!

01:03.079 --> 01:04.407
Maddie!

01:06.854 --> 01:10.252
- Fucking, fucking shit!
- Fuck off!

01:10.254 --> 01:14.012
For shit's sake! I was sleeping!
Fuck off!

01:14.014 --> 01:17.612
I was fucking working until...
Maddie!

01:17.614 --> 01:19.572
Fuck off!

01:19.574 --> 01:22.092
All I'm asking you to do is turn the
fucking music down!

01:22.094 --> 01:24.054
Fuck off!

01:26.214 --> 01:27.692
Sorry.

01:27.694 --> 01:30.212
I want to fucking sleep, Maddie!

01:30.214 --> 01:32.612
You think I give a shit? Fuck off!

01:32.614 --> 01:35.332
I just want you to turn
that fucking music down!

01:35.334 --> 01:37.052
I'm not turning it down! Go!

01:37.054 --> 01:39.692
Go! You're fucking nuts,
aren't you?!

01:39.694 --> 01:43.694
Yeah, go on! Fuck off!

03:04.614 --> 03:07.132
Are you OK? Yeah.

03:07.134 --> 03:11.134
Someone should help you. Yaniv!

03:16.814 --> 03:19.172
What?

03:19.174 --> 03:20.412
Er... what did you just say?

03:20.414 --> 03:22.212
Topol, speak English, all right?

03:22.214 --> 03:25.852
This is an English cafe.
We speak English here.
Pete, you're Greek, man.

03:25.854 --> 03:28.492
Don't tell me who's English.
I decide who's fucking English.

03:28.494 --> 03:29.692
Get on with the takeaways.

03:29.694 --> 03:33.692
Right, if this place hasn't got Â£600
in the till by this evening,

03:33.694 --> 03:37.694
I'm firing the one with the
smallest tits.

03:39.054 --> 03:40.692
It's either you or her, Jakob.

03:40.694 --> 03:44.694
Nice. Go polish your Uzi.

03:53.014 --> 03:56.292
Hi, you lot. Are you ready to order
or d'you need another ten minutes?

03:56.294 --> 03:58.812
Er... what's the souvlaki?

03:58.814 --> 04:01.252
The thing about menus is
they actually say it on...

04:01.254 --> 04:04.452
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it does.
But it didn't say whether or not
you recommend it.

04:04.454 --> 04:07.052
Seriously, fuck off.

04:07.054 --> 04:10.372
Um... Pete wanted me to help.

04:10.374 --> 04:12.612
OK, take this order, then.

04:12.614 --> 04:16.091
Cheeky cunts.

04:16.094 --> 04:18.411
Er... OK, what would you like?

04:18.414 --> 04:19.851
Just orange juice.

04:19.853 --> 04:23.854
Just bring back a shit-load
of fried crap, yeah?

04:24.494 --> 04:28.494
Right, fried crap.
We've got that.

04:31.454 --> 04:34.652
No, I went there last week.
I'm not gonna go again.

04:34.654 --> 04:38.492
Well, who is gonna be there?

04:38.494 --> 04:40.892
Who?

04:40.894 --> 04:44.894
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:46.774 --> 04:50.774
You shouldn't do all her work
for her.

04:51.414 --> 04:54.934
I'm just getting on with things.

04:56.294 --> 04:59.772
It's not so bad here, huh?

04:59.774 --> 05:03.774
Sure. If you like sausage.

05:04.014 --> 05:07.412
What you doing now?

05:07.414 --> 05:10.212
You want to go somewhere else?

05:10.214 --> 05:14.214
Don't you want to go somewhere else
with Amanda?

05:15.534 --> 05:17.372
No, she's, er...

05:17.374 --> 05:19.612
she's boring.

05:19.614 --> 05:22.652
You know?

05:22.654 --> 05:26.654
So, er... let's go take a drink.

05:28.574 --> 05:30.292
I'm going home, Yaniv.

05:30.294 --> 05:32.332
Another time.

05:32.334 --> 05:36.334
OK, another time.

05:37.894 --> 05:41.894
It's a date another time.
I'll remember that.

05:43.854 --> 05:46.134
I don't forget, huh?

06:00.574 --> 06:03.932
Dad, hi. 'Hey.'

06:03.934 --> 06:06.852
Um... I can't talk now, Dad.
I'm walking home.

06:06.854 --> 06:10.492
'Can't you talk
while you're walking?'

06:10.494 --> 06:12.212
I'm just...

06:12.214 --> 06:15.492
Look, er... what is it?

06:15.494 --> 06:17.532
'How are you?'

06:17.534 --> 06:21.412
I'm fine, Dad. Look, I've gotta go.

06:21.414 --> 06:25.252
'Come home for the weekend. Rueby's
missing you. You know how he...'

06:25.254 --> 06:28.692
I've got shifts. I'll have to see
what the shifts are. OK?

06:28.694 --> 06:30.092
'OK.'

06:30.094 --> 06:34.094
Bye.

07:12.414 --> 07:15.172
Hey.

07:15.174 --> 07:17.332
Hey. I forgot your name.

07:17.334 --> 07:20.052
Cassie.

07:20.054 --> 07:22.052
Oh.

07:22.054 --> 07:23.572
I'm going for a whiz.

07:23.574 --> 07:27.332
Good.

07:27.334 --> 07:29.692
Then I'm having a spliff.

07:29.694 --> 07:31.932
Do you want some?

07:31.934 --> 07:35.934
It's pretty trashed in there,
but fuck it.

07:36.334 --> 07:40.334
I don't really smoke anything.
Thanks anyway.

07:41.934 --> 07:42.974
Whatever.

09:59.452 --> 10:00.850
Oh.

10:00.852 --> 10:03.572
Hi.

10:03.593 --> 10:07.593
Hi. Can I get you something?
No, no, I'm fine, thank you.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.231
OK.

10:11.233 --> 10:15.233
It is you, isn't it?
Sorry?

10:16.353 --> 10:19.031
I know it is.

10:19.033 --> 10:23.033
I have been looking at them for days,
and then last night, I realised.

10:25.313 --> 10:27.951
I really don't get what...
These are cool.

10:27.953 --> 10:31.191
Did your boyfriend take them?

10:31.193 --> 10:33.151
No.

10:33.153 --> 10:37.153
There's nothing, though. No name,
nothing. Just... just this website.

10:37.393 --> 10:41.393
You know, this stuff is pretty
incredible.

10:44.913 --> 10:48.913
I...I don't know who took this.

10:49.553 --> 10:53.553
You don't want to tell me. That's OK.

10:57.273 --> 11:00.351
Shit.

11:00.353 --> 11:04.353
I like that nobody knows it's you.

11:05.273 --> 11:09.273
Nobody knows anything, right?

11:17.193 --> 11:21.193
OK.

11:21.833 --> 11:25.833
It's our secret.

11:26.713 --> 11:30.713
But I wish I could look like that.

12:22.793 --> 12:25.511
Oh. Hi.

12:25.513 --> 12:28.671
Hey.

12:28.673 --> 12:32.591
That's cute.

12:32.593 --> 12:35.711
Er... what are you looking for,
Yaniv?

12:35.713 --> 12:39.111
Oh, just things. I collect soldiers.

12:39.113 --> 12:41.231
What?

12:41.233 --> 12:44.431
I like soldiers.

12:44.433 --> 12:46.551
Well, this is not so good.

12:46.553 --> 12:50.071
But you should get that.

12:50.073 --> 12:51.551
And then we should go for a drink.

12:51.553 --> 12:54.551
Oh, I don't know.
Cassie.

12:54.553 --> 12:58.553
It's just a drink.

12:59.233 --> 13:01.591
Yes, good, decided.
We're going. Come on, let's go.

13:01.593 --> 13:04.073
I...
Yalla. Let's go.

13:21.233 --> 13:25.233
This is Cassie.

13:25.313 --> 13:28.351
Hey, speak English.
Don't you have manners?

13:28.353 --> 13:31.591
I said, it's nice to meet you.

13:31.593 --> 13:34.151
Hi. Yanny must like you
if he's got manners now.

13:34.153 --> 13:35.791
Navah.
Hi.

13:35.793 --> 13:37.631
Nobody teaches them
how to speak to a girl.

13:37.633 --> 13:41.471
Let me tell you, his cock is bigger
than his brain. Much bigger.

13:41.473 --> 13:43.511
Er... I don't really know him.

13:43.513 --> 13:45.431
Keep it that way. Come on.

13:45.433 --> 13:49.433
Let's dance.

14:57.953 --> 14:59.831
Sorry.

14:59.833 --> 15:03.833
I scratched you.
Oh, yeah?

15:04.953 --> 15:08.953
No problem.

15:17.673 --> 15:21.673
London is weird, huh?
Yeah.

15:24.673 --> 15:28.591
I like you.

15:28.593 --> 15:31.151
Stay a bit. We'll talk.

15:31.153 --> 15:35.153
I'm sorry. I need to go now.
Why?

15:35.753 --> 15:39.753
I didn't mean this to happen.

15:41.353 --> 15:45.311
Can't we be friends?

15:45.313 --> 15:47.471
This isn't friends, is it?

15:47.473 --> 15:48.631
Why not?

15:48.633 --> 15:52.633
I just... didn't want to be alone
tonight.

15:54.433 --> 15:58.433
Does that sound awful?
That sounds awful.

15:59.313 --> 16:02.191
Do what you need to do, OK?
I'm sorry.

16:02.193 --> 16:04.631
It's my fault.
I thought I would be OK with this.

16:04.633 --> 16:06.871
It doesn't matter.

16:06.873 --> 16:10.311
It's OK.

16:10.313 --> 16:14.313
I'm going, OK?
So go.

16:26.753 --> 16:30.753
Are these your friends?

16:31.473 --> 16:34.111
Some of them.

16:34.113 --> 16:37.911
Some of them are not here any more.

16:37.913 --> 16:41.913
I'll see you.

17:21.752 --> 17:23.631
'Hello?'

17:23.633 --> 17:25.231
Dad?

17:25.233 --> 17:28.070
'Cass? Cassie, it's... it's late.'

17:28.073 --> 17:30.111
Yeah, I couldn't talk before.

17:30.113 --> 17:33.671
'Hello, Cassie? Are you there?'

17:33.673 --> 17:36.191
Yeah, I'm here.

17:36.193 --> 17:40.031
'I'm afraid I've had a drink.'

17:40.033 --> 17:42.593
Dad, are you all right?
'Yes, love.'

17:44.313 --> 17:46.993
'Your mum wants you home.'

17:49.513 --> 17:52.871
Mum died. She's not alive, Dad.

17:52.873 --> 17:56.873
'We need you here, darling.'

19:13.473 --> 19:16.391
Hey!

19:16.393 --> 19:19.793
Hey!

19:21.153 --> 19:23.351
Fuck off!

19:23.353 --> 19:27.111
Jesus Christ!
I'm just playing my fucking...

19:27.113 --> 19:29.831
Oh. Hi.

19:29.833 --> 19:33.631
Er... you... you said I should
come to your room sometime.

19:33.633 --> 19:36.071
Er... well, yeah.

19:36.073 --> 19:40.073
It's, um... it's quite late,
though, isn't it?

19:40.473 --> 19:42.471
So...

19:42.473 --> 19:43.791
Carrie.

19:43.793 --> 19:46.831
It's Cassie.
Oh. Cassie. Right.

19:46.833 --> 19:50.833
Er... you're kind of freaking me out
a bit.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.871
What's up?

19:53.873 --> 19:56.671
I just had a...

19:56.673 --> 20:00.071
I just had a funny day.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.591
Cool.

20:01.593 --> 20:03.991
Isn't that the best kind?

20:03.993 --> 20:07.993
I just fucked this guy.

20:08.433 --> 20:10.831
Yeah?
Yeah.

20:10.833 --> 20:13.071
I don't know why I did it.

20:13.073 --> 20:14.831
Was he nice?

20:14.833 --> 20:17.951
Not really. I wanted to, though.

20:17.953 --> 20:21.151
Oh. Well, there you go.

20:21.153 --> 20:25.153
It doesn't hurt,
as long as they don't ming.

20:27.433 --> 20:29.551
What... what, er... do you do?

20:29.553 --> 20:31.991
I am merely an actor.

20:31.993 --> 20:35.711
Oh. What have you been in?

20:35.713 --> 20:38.351
Oh, you know.

20:38.353 --> 20:40.671
Nothing.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.511
I'm waiting.

20:42.513 --> 20:45.431
For what?

20:45.433 --> 20:49.433
Discovery.

20:49.993 --> 20:53.993
So, how do you live?
Do you have money?

20:54.273 --> 20:57.391
Oh, there's nice people everywhere.

20:57.393 --> 20:58.431
Really?

20:58.433 --> 21:02.433
You just have to ask them for things.

21:02.673 --> 21:05.391
Like what?

21:05.393 --> 21:09.393
Stuff you need.

21:10.993 --> 21:13.991
You've just arrived in London,
haven't you?

21:13.993 --> 21:15.351
Two months ago.

21:15.353 --> 21:17.573
Really?

21:17.666 --> 21:20.104
That long?

21:20.106 --> 21:23.104
God, this house is crap.

21:23.106 --> 21:25.344
Where were you before?

21:25.346 --> 21:27.864
America.
Oh.

21:27.866 --> 21:30.464
I was with a boy and we travelled
a lot,

21:30.466 --> 21:32.824
until we couldn't go any further.

21:32.826 --> 21:36.826
Then it ended, so I came home.

21:37.306 --> 21:39.704
Why?

21:39.706 --> 21:42.984
Cos if it didn't end,
it was for ever.

21:42.986 --> 21:46.784
He's OK.

21:46.786 --> 21:49.264
I think he isn't.

21:49.266 --> 21:53.266
He isn't, is he?

21:54.106 --> 21:56.464
What was his name?

21:56.466 --> 21:58.906
It doesn't matter now.

22:03.426 --> 22:05.944
I think someone's following me.

22:05.946 --> 22:09.946
He's taking weird photos and he's...

22:10.586 --> 22:13.384
Hey. Um... are you outside?

22:13.386 --> 22:15.704
Yeah, I'll... I'll come down now.

22:15.706 --> 22:19.706
Um... look, sorry, it's...
My friend's...

22:20.586 --> 22:22.584
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

22:22.586 --> 22:26.586
But we can talk about this again,
yeah? Yeah. I... I didn't mean...

22:26.626 --> 22:28.544
Well, now that we know each other.

22:28.546 --> 22:30.824
We don't.

22:30.826 --> 22:33.544
I mean, I don't know your name.

22:33.546 --> 22:37.546
Maddie. And you're Cassie.

22:41.106 --> 22:43.739
Hey.

23:40.625 --> 23:44.305
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
We don't show this building much,

23:44.396 --> 23:47.016
and the traffic was awful on the
Finchley Road. I almost gave up.

23:47.047 --> 23:48.147
Oh, that's OK.

23:48.238 --> 23:51.058
My boss couldn't make it, though.
He got called away at short notice.

23:51.079 --> 23:53.197
Oh, bugger it.
No, it's fine.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.837
He just wants me to take photos.

23:55.839 --> 23:59.679
Right. No problem. Come on, then.

24:02.559 --> 24:04.119
No, hang on.

24:07.559 --> 24:09.717
Bingo.

24:09.719 --> 24:13.557
I think it was some kind of computer
company. They went bust, of course.

24:13.559 --> 24:16.997
The offices are up here and there.

24:16.999 --> 24:19.317
Your boss,
does he want the whole building?

24:19.319 --> 24:20.357
Er... sorry?

24:20.359 --> 24:23.117
The management company
don't really want to split the lease.

24:23.119 --> 24:27.119
But I guess he could sublet.
Sublet. Yes.

24:27.679 --> 24:31.679
You know, if you want to take your
photos, you could just pull the doors
behind you.

24:31.999 --> 24:35.597
Just don't tell on me, all right?
It's fine. No problem. OK.

24:35.599 --> 24:37.997
You're not going to throw a rave in
here?

24:37.999 --> 24:40.037
Do they even still have raves?
I don't know.

24:40.039 --> 24:42.957
OK. You've got my number.

24:42.959 --> 24:46.959
Thanks.

25:59.239 --> 26:01.637
Dad, are you feeling better?

26:01.639 --> 26:03.957
'This is Rueben.'

26:03.959 --> 26:07.959
Rueby? Are you OK?

26:09.039 --> 26:13.039
Dad's on the beach and he's sorry.

26:13.319 --> 26:15.157
What for?

26:15.159 --> 26:18.597
For shouting and crying.

26:18.599 --> 26:21.397
Is everything all right, Rueby?

26:21.399 --> 26:23.317
'I was missing Mum this morning,

26:23.319 --> 26:27.319
'and Dad said I could ring you
and you would make me feel better.'

26:28.559 --> 26:31.077
Do you feel better?

26:31.079 --> 26:34.197
'Yes. Because you love me.'

26:34.199 --> 26:36.837
That's right, Rueby.

26:36.839 --> 26:40.839
'Dad says you're coming to play
Connect 4 with me, because he's
crap at it.'

26:42.479 --> 26:45.437
Yeah, I will.
'OK. Bye.'

26:45.439 --> 26:49.439
Bye, Rueby.

27:37.319 --> 27:39.837
Oh, fuck!

27:39.839 --> 27:42.037
Cassie! Look, I'm sorry!
I didn't mean...

27:42.039 --> 27:43.197
Oh!

27:43.199 --> 27:45.277
You little fucking...
What are you doing?

27:45.279 --> 27:46.917
Stop! Shut up!

27:46.919 --> 27:49.237
Let me explain! I didn't...
Don't speak to me!

27:49.239 --> 27:52.317
I'll tell Yaniv what you did,
and he'll fuck you up! Cassie!

27:52.319 --> 27:56.157
Don't speak to me!
What do you do? Do you wank?

27:56.159 --> 28:00.159
What? No! No, I...

28:05.159 --> 28:09.159
No, don't. Cassie! Cassie, wait!

28:57.519 --> 29:00.157
- Have a good day. Bye.
- See you. Bye.

29:00.159 --> 29:02.519
Bye.

29:05.119 --> 29:09.119
Hi.

29:19.439 --> 29:21.837
Oh, hey.
Hey.

29:21.839 --> 29:23.757
What have you got there?

29:23.759 --> 29:26.877
A kite. I found it.

29:26.879 --> 29:29.437
What are you going to do with it?

29:29.439 --> 29:33.439
Fix it.

30:11.839 --> 30:14.557
You do realise he's going to
fire you if you keep on being late?

30:14.559 --> 30:17.797
It's OK. I don't really care.
I'm leaving anyway.

30:17.799 --> 30:21.799
Oh. No, you're not. You can't leave
me with these miserable tossers.

30:23.399 --> 30:24.957
OK, why?

30:24.959 --> 30:27.397
I'm bored. Gotta move, you know.

30:27.399 --> 30:31.157
Really?
What, isn't this all enough for you?

30:31.159 --> 30:33.197
It's too much.

30:33.199 --> 30:37.199
Oh, whatever.

30:37.439 --> 30:39.837
One cheese and ham panini,
one vegetarian breakfast,

30:39.839 --> 30:43.839
one baked potato,
chicken and sweetcorn.

30:45.959 --> 30:49.959
Shit.

30:56.799 --> 30:59.957
What's your problem?
What? Nothing.

30:59.959 --> 31:03.959
I need a bacon and egg sandwich,
Jew boy.

31:23.119 --> 31:27.119
I'm sorry.

31:31.919 --> 31:35.919
You took my camera.

31:39.799 --> 31:41.597
It's a Canon.

31:41.599 --> 31:44.637
The lens alone is worth more than
my...

31:44.639 --> 31:48.117
It's worth a lot.

31:48.119 --> 31:52.119
You... probably don't care, but I've
been saving for two years to get it.

31:52.439 --> 31:56.439
I've done three jobs, one of which
was, er... cleaning toilets in Euston,

31:56.479 --> 32:00.479
and I'm... I'm still paying, so...

32:03.559 --> 32:07.559
What are you going to do?

32:07.759 --> 32:11.759
Nothing.

32:13.319 --> 32:15.317
Look, don't leave.

32:15.319 --> 32:19.319
I'll go. I'll tell Pete.
I... Shut up.

32:21.479 --> 32:24.959
Look, you've gotta give it back to me
or I... I will have to kill myself.

32:28.319 --> 32:32.319
You should be nicer.

32:34.799 --> 32:38.357
I see some things,
and I have to take a picture.

32:38.359 --> 32:42.359
That's all.

32:44.599 --> 32:46.997
And you thought what?
That I'd say no?

32:46.999 --> 32:48.237
Yes.

32:48.239 --> 32:50.877
Well, you were right, Jakob.

32:50.879 --> 32:54.879
I was standing in my room.
My own room! It...

32:56.719 --> 33:00.719
You're beautiful...

33:00.919 --> 33:04.919
and you don't even know.

33:07.199 --> 33:11.199
Tell Pete I quit.

33:31.399 --> 33:32.639
Yeah?

33:35.279 --> 33:38.077
Hi.

33:38.079 --> 33:41.597
Hi.

33:41.599 --> 33:45.117
Just wondering what you were up to.

33:45.119 --> 33:48.517
Just fixing this.

33:48.519 --> 33:51.557
Are you off somewhere?

33:51.559 --> 33:53.797
To see my Dad and my brother
in Wales.

33:53.799 --> 33:57.717
Oh, right.

33:57.719 --> 34:00.517
You coming back?

34:00.519 --> 34:03.717
Probably not.

34:03.719 --> 34:06.877
Er... those guys.

34:06.879 --> 34:10.077
The other morning.
You saw them leaving.

34:10.079 --> 34:14.079
It's none of my business
what you do, Maddie.

34:17.079 --> 34:19.277
I like sex.

34:19.279 --> 34:23.279
So sue me.

34:25.719 --> 34:29.719
Anyway, um...

34:29.839 --> 34:33.839
I was wondering about the guy.
Did you call the police or anything?

34:39.039 --> 34:43.039
Do you have the, you know,
porno pictures on that?

34:43.199 --> 34:45.397
They're not porn.
I know.

34:45.399 --> 34:48.797
I was just messing with you.

34:48.799 --> 34:52.799
Can I see?

35:08.279 --> 35:11.479
Jesus.

35:13.639 --> 35:17.639
That's here.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.997
Shit, man.

35:20.999 --> 35:23.277
You look incredible.

35:23.279 --> 35:26.597
He was stalking me.

35:26.599 --> 35:28.837
Has he stopped?

35:28.839 --> 35:32.839
Yeah. I think so.

35:36.519 --> 35:39.437
This one has 40,000 hits.

35:39.439 --> 35:42.157
What?

35:42.159 --> 35:45.277
It says here that
40,000 dudes have looked at you.

35:45.279 --> 35:47.597
That's manic.

35:47.599 --> 35:51.599
I wish...

35:51.639 --> 35:54.477
I don't know.
What?

35:54.479 --> 35:58.479
I wish someone could
see the beauty in me like that.

35:58.519 --> 36:01.957
Look. I don't want to. Oh, come on.

36:01.959 --> 36:05.959
Don't tell me that you haven't
already been looking at them.

36:06.399 --> 36:09.317
This creep's got you.

36:09.319 --> 36:11.877
He really has.

36:11.879 --> 36:15.837
Anyway, I'm going out with those
idiots downstairs.

36:15.839 --> 36:17.917
Do you want to come?

36:17.919 --> 36:21.919
No. Thanks anyway.

36:21.959 --> 36:25.197
No worries.

36:25.199 --> 36:27.637
Er... listen. Come back.

36:27.639 --> 36:29.477
From Wales. Yeah?

36:29.479 --> 36:32.059
Cos I don't think I can stand it
alone here with the wankers.

36:32.144 --> 36:34.441
I'll think about it.

37:22.939 --> 37:24.505
Fuck.

38:24.102 --> 38:26.502
OK, two full English.
One with chips, one with beans.

38:26.530 --> 38:27.928
Burger and chips, egg and chips.

38:27.930 --> 38:30.248
Go! Take this shit away!
All right. Look, chill out, Pete.

38:30.250 --> 38:33.568
Chill out? I'm dying here. Just take
it away. Go, go, go, go.

38:33.570 --> 38:36.208
Fuck's sake. I'm cooking in my
own kitchen. It's fucking degrading.

38:36.210 --> 38:40.088
Two baked potatoes with tuna.
Three teas. Yaniv, teas, go.
All right.

38:40.090 --> 38:42.848
Two coffees. Black Americano.
Caramel latte. One chicken supreme.

38:42.850 --> 38:46.328
What? Let me see that.

38:46.330 --> 38:48.928
Chicken fucking what?
I mean, how do we do that?

38:48.930 --> 38:51.848
Chicken fucking... What kind
of homosexual bollocks is this?

38:51.850 --> 38:53.688
Fuck's sake.

38:53.690 --> 38:57.650
Jakob, he makes it nice and creamy.
Creamy? I'll give him creamy,
the little cunt. Where is he?

39:03.290 --> 39:07.088
Hi. Sorry about the wait.

39:07.090 --> 39:11.090
These are so fucking cool.

39:11.570 --> 39:15.570
It's like some majorly on-trend shit.
70,000 hits. Marcel sent me the link.

39:16.410 --> 39:18.888
It's some serious
mysterious shit going on.

39:18.890 --> 39:21.288
She's not even asking for anything.

39:21.290 --> 39:24.568
I love it, man.

39:24.570 --> 39:27.608
Hi. Orange juice, please. Stephen?

39:27.610 --> 39:29.648
Latte.
Latte.

39:29.650 --> 39:33.650
Skinny, yeah?
Skinny is the golden rule, right?

39:35.050 --> 39:38.048
Skinny is good, right?

39:38.050 --> 39:42.050
Right.

40:11.130 --> 40:13.768
You're leaving too?

40:13.770 --> 40:16.130
I might.

40:18.450 --> 40:22.450
What I want, it doesn't mean
anything?

40:25.250 --> 40:28.168
I'm sorry.

40:28.170 --> 40:31.608
But you like me?

40:31.610 --> 40:34.248
I don't know, Yaniv.
It's not about that.

40:34.250 --> 40:38.250
I don't care if you like me.

40:39.210 --> 40:43.210
Is there somebody else?

40:43.330 --> 40:45.968
I just don't want to sleep with you.
That's all. And you...

40:45.970 --> 40:48.490
What's wrong with sleeping with me?
You liked it.

40:52.890 --> 40:55.208
Yaniv.

40:55.210 --> 40:57.968
I'm waiting, OK? I can't explain.

40:57.970 --> 41:01.608
Waiting? What are you waiting for?

41:01.610 --> 41:04.248
For something else.

41:04.250 --> 41:07.648
OK. Uh-huh.

41:07.650 --> 41:09.888
Let me know when it happens.

41:09.890 --> 41:13.890
You know, some places I've been to,
you can't be waiting for something.

41:15.050 --> 41:17.768
You can't wait.

41:17.770 --> 41:21.770
You can't wait.

42:37.970 --> 42:41.568
I take pictures.

42:41.570 --> 42:45.088
It's the only thing I can do.
You scared me, Jakob.

42:45.090 --> 42:47.608
I know, I know. I'm...

42:47.610 --> 42:51.610
I'm a complete... schlossfarter.

42:52.410 --> 42:54.888
What does that mean?

42:54.890 --> 42:58.890
I don't know. I made it up.

43:05.930 --> 43:07.448
I'll never sleep with you.

43:07.450 --> 43:09.568
Why does everything have to be
about sex?

43:09.570 --> 43:12.488
That's what people want, isn't it?
You just want to fuck.

43:12.490 --> 43:16.490
No, stop spoiling it.
I gave up sex when I was nine.

43:16.690 --> 43:20.448
You had sex when you were...?
No.

43:20.450 --> 43:24.450
That's when I became aware that I
would be a virgin for the rest
of my life.

43:30.450 --> 43:34.450
I just take pictures.

43:34.490 --> 43:38.490
That's all.

43:42.650 --> 43:46.650
Who for?

43:47.010 --> 43:51.010
It doesn't work if nobody looks
at them.

43:51.850 --> 43:55.728
People look at you.

43:55.730 --> 43:59.730
I think you like it.

44:24.370 --> 44:28.370
Can I trust you?

44:35.370 --> 44:39.370
It's pure, Cassie.

44:40.250 --> 44:43.848
All it is, is you...

44:43.850 --> 44:45.928
me...

44:45.930 --> 44:49.930
and the world sees what we want.

44:56.690 --> 45:00.690
There's too much light.

45:07.250 --> 45:09.368
What are you wearing?

45:09.370 --> 45:12.328
Um... nothing special.

45:12.330 --> 45:16.330
That's good. Show me.

45:33.810 --> 45:37.810
OK?

45:37.970 --> 45:41.970
OK.

45:55.530 --> 45:58.970
Something's coming.

45:59.026 --> 46:00.424
Magic.

46:00.426 --> 46:04.424
Hey. Ha! Hey!

46:04.426 --> 46:06.424
I'm one of the chosen people.

46:06.426 --> 46:10.426
Is he watching you, Jakob?
Er... yeah.

46:12.706 --> 46:14.224
Everyone gets lonely here.

46:14.226 --> 46:15.704
It's OK.

46:15.706 --> 46:17.904
This is Marcel Hulot.

46:17.906 --> 46:21.906
We were looking for you.
