WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.920
Okay, lights out, 20 minutes.

00:03.003 --> 00:04.671
No funny business.

00:04.755 --> 00:07.049
And no fucking.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.099
- Now do you believe me?

00:16.183 --> 00:18.519
He's a fucking psychopath.

00:18.602 --> 00:21.021
- Okay.
It does seem like an odd coincidence

00:21.104 --> 00:22.314
your wires just snapped.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.525
- It's no coincidence. It's absurd.

00:24.608 --> 00:27.653
Those lines are strong enough
to hold a goddamn elephant.

00:27.736 --> 00:28.695
Where's your phone at?

00:28.779 --> 00:30.447
- He confiscated it.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.674
Kevin. He said lights out. We can't leave.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.551
- He's not my camp counselor.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.219
You know what I'm-a do?

00:52.302 --> 00:54.429
I'm about to go,
I'm about to get my phone back,

00:54.513 --> 00:55.806
and I'm-a see what other weird shit

00:55.889 --> 00:58.392
he hiding in his office
that he don't want me to see.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.061
- Kevin... don't.

01:29.131 --> 01:33.177
- Ronnie, baby.
- Mon garçon.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.554
- Have a seat.
- Ah.

01:35.637 --> 01:39.558
- Uh, pull up scene 12, please.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.185
Have a seat.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.647
- This is a bad idea.
- It's a good idea.

01:45.731 --> 01:48.525
Wilcox won't murder me in front of you.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.986
Come on. There's his office, come on.

01:52.029 --> 01:55.532
Shit.
- Do you have a bobby pin?

01:55.616 --> 01:59.745
- Yeah. Yeah. It's in the bun
on the back of my fucking head.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.288
- Okay, don't be an asshole.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.540
I'll find a paper clip. Excuse me.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.543
- Wait, you know how to pick a lock?

02:06.627 --> 02:09.046
- South Side of Chicago, born and raised.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.547
- It's not North Philadelphia,

02:10.631 --> 02:11.924
but I'm not gonna hold it against you.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.510
- Got it.
- Hey.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.599
- Where the fuck are you at?

02:20.682 --> 02:24.394
Oh, God. Oh, fuck, I can't see shit.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.688
Where you at?

02:26.772 --> 02:29.107
- Help! Help me!
- I got you, Little Kev!

02:29.191 --> 02:30.150
- Oh, hell no!

02:30.234 --> 02:31.610
- Aah!

02:31.693 --> 02:33.695
- Help!
- It's fucking hot!

02:34.780 --> 02:37.407
- Whoa.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.744
- You damn right. It is authentic.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.205
- He doesn't even know he's being filmed.
- Exactly.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.917
I have been chasing
for this cinema verité style

02:47.000 --> 02:50.629
of realistic hard action filmmaking
for years.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.757
It is my white whale, my unicorn.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.510
All I needed was an actor who was fragile,

02:56.593 --> 03:00.514
vulnerable, afraid of being forgotten.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.560
Afraid of being forgotten.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.645
Thank you, Kevin.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.273
You're a gift. Thank you.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.024
Thank you.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.700
Any questions, uh, for tomorrow's scenes?

03:19.783 --> 03:21.326
- Oh, no, uh...

03:21.410 --> 03:25.330
Whoa, I'm so... je suis fatigué!

03:25.414 --> 03:28.375
I should get back to the set,
so... bonsoir.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.835
- Bonsoir.
- J'aime beaucoup.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.920
- Merci.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.757
Again.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.138
- Hey, can I... can I ask you a question?

03:41.221 --> 03:42.973
- Yeah.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.267
- So, you... you remember earlier today

03:45.350 --> 03:47.603
when we were shooting
the scene on green screen?

03:47.686 --> 03:50.314
Like, like, right before
the wires snapped?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.649
You kind of seemed like you was...

03:52.733 --> 03:54.276
like you were really into it.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.570
- It's called acting.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.073
- Yeah, you were acting
like you wanted to kiss me.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.158
- Yes.

04:02.201 --> 04:05.120
- Got it, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.205
Yeah.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.716
Come on. Let's go.

04:17.799 --> 04:20.969
- Fuck. Stealing my shit.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.013
Hollywood bitch.

04:38.362 --> 04:39.905
- You got anything?

04:39.988 --> 04:41.406
- No. You?

04:41.490 --> 04:44.618
- He's got a drawer full of old headshots.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.496
- Oh.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.206
- "Coach Ron, you are the bright light

04:49.289 --> 04:50.791
in the darkest parts of my soul."

04:50.874 --> 04:52.334
The fuck does that mean?

04:52.417 --> 04:54.294
- We should get out of here soon.

04:54.378 --> 04:56.672
- No, we shouldn't.
I know there's some stuff in here

04:56.755 --> 04:59.007
that he don't want us to see.
Just got to look for it.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.720
Probably got one of them, like,
secret compartments somewhere.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.347
Got it.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.224
Bingo.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.600
- Holy shit.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.357
- Here.
I got another lock for you to pick.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.817
- What do you think's in there?
- I don't know.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.902
Some shit that he don't want
nobody to find.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.739
Shit.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.208
- I'll get your ass.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.358
Oh.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.527
Isn't this interesting?

06:02.237 --> 06:05.782
Well, I know that you're both
pretending to be asleep.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.410
And that's fine. It's probably the best

06:08.493 --> 06:10.787
acting that either of you will ever do

06:10.871 --> 06:12.206
in your entire lives.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.791
Especially you, Agent Hart.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.753
But if I find out that either of you

06:17.836 --> 06:20.005
left this bunk without my permission,

06:20.088 --> 06:22.299
you'll regret the day
you ever stepped into

06:22.382 --> 06:24.885
Ron Wilcox's Action Star School.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.688
If you weren't fake sleeping,
you would have woken up.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.255
- Holy shit. That was too close.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.506
- You're telling me?
