WEBVTT

01:01.600 --> 01:03.667
Hyun-jun is shocked and feels confused

01:04.066 --> 01:06.400
when he runs into Seung-hee
whom he thought was dead.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.567
He opens San Baek's confidential file
that he stole from the NSS

01:19.300 --> 01:20.367
and finds out

01:20.433 --> 01:23.367
that his parents were assassinated
by San Baek.

01:32.100 --> 01:32.934
Meanwhile,

01:33.400 --> 01:35.367
Chul-young finds the hideout
of the terrorist group

01:35.800 --> 01:38.734
and brings a mysterious suitcase with him.

01:43.033 --> 01:44.200
Something you've never imagined

01:44.734 --> 01:46.867
will take place at the center of Seoul.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.533
EPISODE 12

02:14.734 --> 02:15.600
Which way is it?

02:15.834 --> 02:17.066
He must be in the priest's office.

02:20.033 --> 02:20.900
Get down!

02:40.300 --> 02:41.166
Father!

02:42.500 --> 02:43.333
Father!

02:47.367 --> 02:48.200
Father!

02:50.000 --> 02:50.900
Hyun-jun.

02:56.500 --> 02:57.367
Father.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.133
Father. Father!

03:00.233 --> 03:01.166
Father.

03:01.734 --> 03:02.600
Father!

03:38.767 --> 03:40.200
Hyun-jun Kim showed up.

03:48.333 --> 03:49.233
Did you find him?

03:49.834 --> 03:51.233
Hyun-jun Kim is here.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.133
Get rid of him.

04:30.667 --> 04:31.667
We should get out now.

04:37.133 --> 04:38.233
Hyun-jun.

05:10.900 --> 05:11.734
Run!

06:06.734 --> 06:07.667
It's San Baek.

06:10.333 --> 06:11.433
He killed Father.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.767
It's me. How did it go?

06:32.834 --> 06:33.867
We failed, sir.

06:34.233 --> 06:35.467
Two of our agents were killed.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.900
Wind up the case and withdraw right away.

06:42.633 --> 06:43.633
I need to talk to you.

06:47.367 --> 06:48.233
Go ahead.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.300
Then, I'll leave you two--

06:50.367 --> 06:51.233
No.

06:51.700 --> 06:52.834
You must listen, too.

06:56.433 --> 06:57.867
Hyun-jun is alive.

06:59.967 --> 07:01.066
What are you talking about?

07:01.400 --> 07:02.533
He's alive.

07:02.633 --> 07:03.467
Ma'am,

07:03.567 --> 07:06.066
-that's not what the Hungarian agency--
-That was manipulated.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.433
Someone manipulated the information.

07:09.934 --> 07:12.300
Forensic Science Division analyzed
the photos of those

07:12.900 --> 07:14.633
who intruded Sa-woo's place,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.867
and the result shows that it's 74% likely
to be Hyun-jun Kim.

07:18.767 --> 07:21.600
Secretary Oh also said
it's highly likely to be Hyun-jun.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.100
That doesn't assure

07:24.667 --> 07:26.934
that Hyun-jun is alive.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.200
I saw him with my eyes.

07:29.934 --> 07:30.800
What do you mean?

07:32.200 --> 07:33.033
Where?

07:33.100 --> 07:34.633
The terrorist I ran into

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
in the secret archive
when the NSS was attacked

07:37.500 --> 07:38.734
is Hyun-jun.

07:39.467 --> 07:40.667
I'm 100% certain.

07:41.133 --> 07:43.567
He even killed a terrorist
who tried to attack me

07:44.367 --> 07:45.433
to save me.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.734
I think

08:23.767 --> 08:25.000
Hyun-jun invaded the archive

08:25.266 --> 08:28.066
and opened my storage
with other terrorists.

08:29.233 --> 08:32.667
The secrets behind the death
of Hyun-jun's parents

08:33.533 --> 08:35.967
and the fact that I am
an Iris agent is in there.

08:54.667 --> 08:55.800
Do you remember

08:56.767 --> 08:57.834
who he is?

09:03.300 --> 09:04.834
Now that the priest has passed away,

09:06.033 --> 09:07.500
the only thing that can reveal my past

09:09.066 --> 09:10.100
is the voice.

09:13.767 --> 09:15.133
I need to meet the owner of the voice.

09:15.934 --> 09:17.033
How?

09:18.166 --> 09:19.433
I'll contact him first.

09:21.133 --> 09:22.166
What are they doing inside?

09:23.500 --> 09:25.200
I think there will be backups soon

09:25.266 --> 09:27.000
for the next mission.

09:27.467 --> 09:28.700
Once they get here,

09:29.266 --> 09:30.767
it'll be harder to work independently.

09:31.367 --> 09:32.667
You must finish before they come.

09:34.633 --> 09:35.533
Okay.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.800
Come in.

09:47.767 --> 09:50.367
Hyun-jun showed up,
but we failed to remove him.

09:51.567 --> 09:52.567
Then,

09:53.400 --> 09:54.300
what should I do now?

09:54.467 --> 09:55.834
Keep a close watch on Seung-hee.

09:56.533 --> 09:58.233
As long as she knows
that Hyun-jun is alive,

09:58.667 --> 09:59.800
she'll try to meet him

10:00.333 --> 10:01.967
by all means.

10:02.867 --> 10:03.867
This is all caused

10:04.600 --> 10:05.600
by the fact

10:05.667 --> 10:08.600
that you failed
to get rid of Hyun-jun in Hungary.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.133
Get it done without any mistakes.

10:14.800 --> 10:15.734
Yes, sir.

10:52.433 --> 10:53.834
Is the actinolite factory list ready?

10:53.967 --> 10:56.800
Yes, I got the result
that meets the condition.

10:57.000 --> 10:57.967
But there are too many.

10:59.333 --> 11:00.633
Apply discriminant techniques

11:00.700 --> 11:02.333
and narrow them down.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.367
Okay.

11:03.433 --> 11:04.633
I was about to get down to it.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.266
Is there anything else left?

11:12.700 --> 11:13.800
When you get the final result,

11:13.867 --> 11:15.066
bring it to me first.

11:16.166 --> 11:17.033
But I was told

11:17.100 --> 11:19.033
to bring it to Secretary Park
and the SWAT right away

11:19.100 --> 11:20.834
because they'll perform
the field investigation.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.433
I need to check something first.

11:25.433 --> 11:26.433
Please.

11:35.633 --> 11:36.567
Did you look into it?

11:36.867 --> 11:37.734
Yes.

11:37.967 --> 11:39.233
But it's not easy.

11:39.600 --> 11:42.300
The manipulation wasn't done
by a personal computer.

11:42.667 --> 11:43.533
Then?

11:43.600 --> 11:46.333
I found out that the data was accessed
from a terminal in the server room.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.200
Then, we should check
the server room's log records.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.700
It's not that simple though.

11:52.767 --> 11:53.600
As you know,

11:53.700 --> 11:55.333
only those with the first class authority

11:55.667 --> 11:57.266
are allowed to access the records.

11:57.333 --> 11:58.867
Or we should get Director's approval,

11:59.667 --> 12:00.834
which isn't a viable option now.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.100
Please find other ways.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.233
I must know who fabricated the data.

12:10.066 --> 12:11.033
Ms. Choi did?

12:11.266 --> 12:12.133
Yes.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.400
She asked me to bring
the final list of asbestos factories

12:14.934 --> 12:16.400
to her first.

12:18.834 --> 12:19.734
What should I do?

12:22.300 --> 12:23.266
Listen to me.

12:23.867 --> 12:26.033
Ms. Choi is in mentally unstable condition

12:26.100 --> 12:27.533
due to Hyun-jun's death.

12:28.233 --> 12:30.667
If you give her the list,

12:30.767 --> 12:32.066
we never know what she'd do with it.

12:32.166 --> 12:33.266
It can become dangerous.

12:33.767 --> 12:35.767
Should I report this, then?

12:35.834 --> 12:36.667
No.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.567
I'll take care of this.
When you get the result,

12:39.934 --> 12:41.033
bring it to me right away.

12:42.000 --> 12:42.867
Okay.

12:48.367 --> 12:50.867
The North delegation completed their trip

12:51.166 --> 12:52.400
and returned to the North today.

12:52.867 --> 12:54.834
Were there any problems
during their visit?

12:55.367 --> 12:57.200
No, it went without any trouble.

12:57.734 --> 12:59.066
I think we'll have to decide

12:59.266 --> 13:01.200
the date for a summit in Pyeongyang.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.567
I'll have Chief Secretary Jung

13:03.633 --> 13:04.800
visit Pyeongyang.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.400
Yes, sir. I will.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.800
I'd like Secretary Hong and Director Baek

13:11.934 --> 13:13.834
to be included in the envoy.

13:16.767 --> 13:18.333
I need to have a discussion

13:18.400 --> 13:19.900
with Director Baek now.

13:20.934 --> 13:21.834
Yes, sir.

13:29.834 --> 13:31.100
How is the investigation

13:31.934 --> 13:33.367
on the terrorists going?

13:34.633 --> 13:36.266
We're making our utmost efforts,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.133
but we're having difficulties
in unraveling the clues.

13:42.300 --> 13:43.867
So, I'd like to ask you

13:44.467 --> 13:47.734
to report the case to the Security Council

13:48.367 --> 13:50.400
before setting the summit plan--

13:50.467 --> 13:51.500
I can't do that.

13:52.433 --> 13:53.834
If this issue becomes public,

13:54.066 --> 13:55.834
cancellation of the summit will be
inevitable,

13:56.667 --> 13:59.734
and the inter-Korean relations
will fall into confusion.

14:00.967 --> 14:03.367
That's what those who stole
the detonator want,

14:04.433 --> 14:07.233
and I will never give in to them.

14:08.133 --> 14:11.033
I'll proceed with the summit as planned.

14:11.867 --> 14:12.767
Solve this case

14:13.433 --> 14:14.633
before the summit.

14:17.066 --> 14:17.967
Yes, sir.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.767
HAIL DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

14:20.834 --> 14:22.900
It seems like envoys from the South
will visit Pyeongyang

14:23.767 --> 14:25.633
to discuss details regarding the summit.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.000
Who will come?

14:28.600 --> 14:29.767
It will be Chief Secretary Jung

14:30.367 --> 14:32.100
and Director Baek of the NSS.

14:33.233 --> 14:34.133
San Baek?

14:34.433 --> 14:35.467
Do you know him?

14:39.433 --> 14:40.567
Long time ago,

14:41.633 --> 14:43.467
I've met him in Shanghai.

14:46.033 --> 14:48.166
Things are developing much faster
than expected.

14:48.633 --> 14:50.400
After the visit of the South envoys,

14:51.934 --> 14:54.433
the North-South summit schedule
will be confirmed.

14:55.667 --> 14:56.834
Please set your worries aside.

14:57.867 --> 14:59.600
That will never happen.

15:09.967 --> 15:12.033
Ma'am, I've sent you
the files through the web.

15:12.233 --> 15:13.200
What files?

15:13.533 --> 15:17.500
Secretary Park told me to send you
all the records of recent domestic cases.

15:18.700 --> 15:21.200
-Tell me if you need anything.
-Okay.

15:43.734 --> 15:47.266
The case number B10310-26
is a firearm-related case.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.066
Why is it classified as a general case?

15:50.266 --> 15:51.967
Well, I have no idea.

15:52.467 --> 15:53.734
Request for investigation records

15:53.800 --> 15:55.700
and transfer its investigation authority
to the NSS.

15:55.834 --> 15:56.667
Okay.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.567
Michael.

16:10.967 --> 16:13.567
This is my colleague at work.

16:14.333 --> 16:15.734
Hello, I'm Seung-hee Choi.

16:16.333 --> 16:17.200
Welcome.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.400
Is the list ready yet?

16:30.834 --> 16:31.767
It's done.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.033
I arranged ones with
the highest possibility from the top.

16:35.567 --> 16:40.600
Storage C24-03 in Seoksu, Anyang
seems to be the prime place for now.

16:40.667 --> 16:41.567
Good job.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.934
Send it to me.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.133
Okay.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.133
The final list is complete.

16:53.467 --> 16:55.934
We'll have to send agents
for investigation soon.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.400
We must find it

16:58.734 --> 17:00.400
before they start their investigation.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.333
Try to buy more time.

17:05.934 --> 17:06.767
Yes, sir.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.300
I found them.

17:30.100 --> 17:32.500
They're at Storage C24-03
in Seoksu, Anyang.

17:32.834 --> 17:33.700
Okay.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.033
What are you doing?

18:09.734 --> 18:10.633
Right...

18:11.000 --> 18:12.033
Nothing.

18:13.100 --> 18:14.266
Take a look.

18:18.033 --> 18:19.033
What is this?

18:20.033 --> 18:21.100
Did you know

18:21.367 --> 18:22.867
that Hyun-jun grew up in an orphanage?

18:24.800 --> 18:25.667
Yes, he told me.

18:25.934 --> 18:27.467
The orphanage he lived

18:27.934 --> 18:28.967
is in this church.

18:30.233 --> 18:31.333
Hyun-jun and I visited there

18:31.867 --> 18:33.734
to see the priest who raised him

18:34.367 --> 18:37.433
and ask about the memories
of his childhood that he'd lost.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.367
That priest is killed.

18:40.867 --> 18:41.900
This case...

18:42.633 --> 18:44.367
must have something to do with Hyun-jun.

20:25.700 --> 20:26.600
Let's...

20:28.834 --> 20:29.700
go.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.367
I'm sure the priest had clues.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.100
That's why he's murdered.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.033
We know nothing for sure yet.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.233
Don't jump to the conclusion.

21:09.734 --> 21:11.867
No. It has become even clearer.

21:14.333 --> 21:15.533
Hyun-jun is alive

21:16.333 --> 21:17.333
and back here.

21:18.734 --> 21:20.300
And someone doesn't want him

21:20.367 --> 21:21.433
to be alive and back.

21:22.834 --> 21:23.900
Hyun-jun is in danger.

21:24.433 --> 21:25.433
We must find him first.

21:27.433 --> 21:28.433
If your guess is right,

21:29.233 --> 21:31.333
he's nothing but a terrorist
who invaded the NSS.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.166
What will you do if you find him?

21:34.233 --> 21:35.700
There must be some reason.

21:35.767 --> 21:36.667
Seung-hee Choi!

21:36.734 --> 21:38.467
We must find out the plot

21:39.734 --> 21:40.667
that made him to do so.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.100
Do you know why the terrorists
invaded the NSS?

21:45.633 --> 21:48.166
They stole a detonator from the R&D room.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.400
When it's connected
with an enriched uranium sphere,

21:51.533 --> 21:53.133
it immediately turns
into a nuclear weapon.

21:54.233 --> 21:55.233
Now Hyun-jun is

21:55.400 --> 21:57.834
a member of the terrorist group
that owns a nuclear bomb.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.834
I also desperately want to know
what made Hyun-jun change like that.

22:06.133 --> 22:07.266
But if

22:08.467 --> 22:10.300
we take a rash approach,

22:11.800 --> 22:13.266
we might put ourselves in danger.

22:13.667 --> 22:14.600
Don't you

22:16.266 --> 22:17.667
understand what I'm saying?

22:41.433 --> 22:42.533
Can we meet up?

22:43.166 --> 22:44.200
Does it mean

22:44.266 --> 22:46.133
you decided to trust me?

22:48.233 --> 22:49.066
I am

22:49.533 --> 22:50.934
in Korea now.

22:52.000 --> 22:52.934
Where is it?

22:53.000 --> 22:53.934
I'll go myself.

22:54.800 --> 22:55.934
Let me contact you again.

23:24.333 --> 23:25.200
Don't move!

23:29.834 --> 23:30.767
I can't.

23:31.333 --> 23:34.767
You also know that the security
of the archive has been tightened.

23:35.467 --> 23:36.633
We need Director's approval

23:36.700 --> 23:37.967
to access the archive.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.300
I know.

23:39.367 --> 23:41.000
That's why I'm begging you now.

23:42.433 --> 23:43.333
Seung-hee.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.567
Hyun-jun was looking for something
in there.

23:46.333 --> 23:48.800
This must have something to do
with the priest's death.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.367
I have to find that out.

24:05.333 --> 24:06.633
I modified your access level

24:07.166 --> 24:08.533
so that you can access the archive.

24:09.066 --> 24:09.967
Okay.

24:10.066 --> 24:12.033
I'll open a bypass route to the storage.

24:13.233 --> 24:14.133
I can't hold it long.

24:14.200 --> 24:15.400
Make it in five minutes.

24:15.934 --> 24:16.867
Thank you.

25:18.567 --> 25:20.266
Seung-hee, get out of there now.

26:09.533 --> 26:10.967
What the hell do you think you're doing?

26:12.467 --> 26:13.800
Tell me what you were doing in there.

26:16.433 --> 26:19.767
I wanted to know why Hyun-jun
went into the archive.

26:20.367 --> 26:21.967
Can't you really see what's going on here?

26:23.233 --> 26:25.333
How can I trust you and send you
on missions

26:25.400 --> 26:27.667
when you can't even control your mind
in such urgent situation?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.133
From now on,

26:30.834 --> 26:32.667
back off from all your tasks
and be on standby.

26:33.867 --> 26:34.734
Director!

26:36.600 --> 26:37.667
Get out.

26:51.767 --> 26:53.266
Even if Seung-hee begged you for help,

26:54.033 --> 26:55.166
you should've stopped her.

26:55.500 --> 26:56.734
How could you help her?

26:57.467 --> 26:58.467
I'm sorry, sir.

26:58.834 --> 26:59.767
It's too late.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.100
You'll also be suspended from your duties.

27:03.633 --> 27:04.533
Why did Seung-hee

27:05.066 --> 27:06.433
enter the archive?

27:08.400 --> 27:09.433
Tell me.

27:11.100 --> 27:12.033
Seung-hee believes

27:12.100 --> 27:14.166
that the terrorist she ran into
in the archive

27:14.800 --> 27:15.967
was Hyun-jun.

27:16.300 --> 27:17.166
What?

27:17.834 --> 27:19.166
What are you talking about?

27:19.934 --> 27:20.967
How can a dead man

27:21.033 --> 27:22.734
show up in the archive?

27:23.266 --> 27:24.367
Does it mean she saw a ghost?

27:25.333 --> 27:27.934
The information about Hyun-jun's death
from Hungarian agency

27:28.066 --> 27:30.000
was manipulated inside the NSS.

27:30.700 --> 27:31.867
Who would do such thing?

27:32.000 --> 27:34.400
You said the terrorists
could attack the NSS

27:34.734 --> 27:36.633
because someone inside the NSS
helped them, right?

27:38.166 --> 27:40.767
I'm convinced that the same person
manipulated the information.

27:42.200 --> 27:43.100
Who else

27:43.667 --> 27:44.767
knows about this?

27:45.100 --> 27:47.266
No one except me and Seung-hee.

28:01.266 --> 28:03.400
We need to talk.

28:12.467 --> 28:14.367
I heard the reason

28:15.100 --> 28:16.166
you went into the archive.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.033
Do I have to believe that?

28:18.767 --> 28:20.200
How can that happen?

28:20.767 --> 28:22.567
It's already too hard to believe
that he's alive.

28:22.633 --> 28:24.300
How could he be with the terrorists?

28:25.867 --> 28:27.166
I also have no idea

28:28.200 --> 28:29.500
why he'd done such thing.

28:33.467 --> 28:35.300
Who else knows about this

28:35.367 --> 28:36.800
besides Secretary Yang?

28:36.867 --> 28:38.800
I told Director Baek and Sa-woo.

28:42.967 --> 28:44.133
Don't make a fuss over this

28:44.367 --> 28:45.300
and stay quiet.

28:45.533 --> 28:46.967
If that's true,

28:48.033 --> 28:49.233
it means

28:50.433 --> 28:52.533
there's a plot both you and I don't know
is involved.

28:53.367 --> 28:54.834
You know what I mean.

29:55.166 --> 29:56.233
Follow me.

30:37.166 --> 30:39.467
Give me your cell phones and weapons.

31:48.367 --> 31:49.300
Please wait here.

31:51.133 --> 31:51.967
Let's go.

33:34.033 --> 33:36.567
I am sorry
for what happened to Father Raphael.

33:40.767 --> 33:41.800
Do you know him?

33:42.633 --> 33:45.300
I met him once, long time ago.

33:46.467 --> 33:47.433
I tried...

33:48.333 --> 33:50.834
to take you with me from the church

33:52.433 --> 33:54.266
but failed because of San Baek.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.433
You visiting Father Raphael tells me

33:58.834 --> 34:00.667
that you've found out quite a lot.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.700
I opened San Baek's storage

34:03.633 --> 34:06.767
in the secret archive of the NSS.

34:07.233 --> 34:08.367
What did you find there?

34:08.600 --> 34:10.033
I found the case files

34:10.633 --> 34:12.100
that San Baek was engaged in.

34:12.867 --> 34:13.934
Among them was...

34:15.233 --> 34:17.166
information about my parents' death.

34:20.433 --> 34:21.333
Is it true

34:22.433 --> 34:24.166
that it's San Baek who killed my parents?

34:37.166 --> 34:39.266
Why did San Baek choose me?

34:43.133 --> 34:44.834
I want to get some fresh air.

35:00.767 --> 35:02.367
Your parents and I participated

35:03.433 --> 35:06.500
in the nuclear program
of Chung-hee Park's administration.

35:08.533 --> 35:09.767
To tell you the truth,

35:10.500 --> 35:12.000
I invited your parents

35:12.567 --> 35:14.500
to participate
in the nuclear development program.

35:15.166 --> 35:17.166
They're Jeong-kuk Kim and Mi-hyun Yun.
They're married.

35:17.300 --> 35:19.333
They both are nuclear physicists
who studied at MIT

35:19.400 --> 35:21.700
and own the core technology
that can put our nuclear development

35:21.767 --> 35:22.767
into practical use.

35:23.834 --> 35:25.000
Your father and I were

35:26.100 --> 35:27.600
old friends.

35:29.066 --> 35:29.967
It was only me

35:30.567 --> 35:32.567
who participated in the research.

35:34.967 --> 35:37.367
But when the nuclear program reached
its final stage,

35:38.433 --> 35:40.133
we needed your parents' help

35:41.633 --> 35:44.266
in order to complete the project.

35:45.266 --> 35:46.133
And

35:48.133 --> 35:49.300
that happened.

35:50.333 --> 35:51.667
After President Park passed away,

35:52.400 --> 35:54.667
the core members of the nuclear program

35:55.633 --> 35:58.867
started to die mysteriously.

35:59.967 --> 36:03.400
Your parents also died that way,

36:05.200 --> 36:08.633
and I barely managed to survive
and escaped from Korea.

36:09.900 --> 36:11.100
Since then,

36:12.333 --> 36:16.000
I've dedicated my life
to discover the truth.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.433
So what did you find out?

36:19.834 --> 36:20.700
It's the truth

36:21.400 --> 36:24.033
that you already know.

36:25.367 --> 36:26.333
It's Iris.

36:27.300 --> 36:28.667
It is Iris

36:30.166 --> 36:31.400
that is behind the conspiracy.

36:32.633 --> 36:34.433
After I found out the truth,

36:35.667 --> 36:38.367
I started to gather forces
to fight against Iris.

36:39.633 --> 36:40.500
However,

36:41.266 --> 36:43.333
Iris found us shortly after,

36:44.633 --> 36:46.500
and most of my colleagues fell victims

36:47.734 --> 36:48.800
to Iris.

36:51.734 --> 36:52.700
It's Seung-ryong Hong,

36:53.000 --> 36:54.100
the last member

36:55.533 --> 36:57.934
who escaped from the North
and tried to hand over

36:59.066 --> 37:00.266
the list of the Iris members.

37:02.700 --> 37:05.867
You wanted to know why San Baek chose you.

37:06.266 --> 37:07.200
You have

37:07.967 --> 37:09.300
a solo mission.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.767
San Baek found out my identity

37:13.100 --> 37:14.200
and thought

37:16.133 --> 37:18.700
he could make me go into action
by using you

37:18.767 --> 37:23.300
since I've spent my whole life
with the guilt about your parents.

37:35.066 --> 37:35.967
What do you want?

37:36.066 --> 37:37.233
I need to check

37:37.767 --> 37:38.867
if Hyun-jun is all right.

37:39.133 --> 37:40.033
Please be seated.

37:53.800 --> 37:54.734
Freeze.

38:01.900 --> 38:02.800
It's all right.

38:14.467 --> 38:16.200
Now the list of the Iris members is
on my hands.

38:16.967 --> 38:17.967
We should capture

38:18.533 --> 38:21.166
San Baek and the Iris members
in Korea, right?

38:21.633 --> 38:22.567
The list is not

38:23.567 --> 38:24.700
complete.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.900
Do you remember how I said

38:28.734 --> 38:30.100
there are more Iris members

38:30.967 --> 38:31.867
besides San Baek?

38:33.700 --> 38:36.467
There's a larger and deeper root
I haven't found out yet.

38:38.700 --> 38:40.166
If we fail to root it out,

38:41.367 --> 38:42.467
both of us will also fail

38:43.500 --> 38:45.000
to retaliate against them.

38:47.166 --> 38:48.333
What should I do now, then?

38:49.900 --> 38:51.600
Do you know

38:52.667 --> 38:54.467
what your colleague terrorists
of Chul-young stole

38:55.533 --> 38:58.000
from the NSS?

38:59.066 --> 38:59.967
I don't.

39:00.066 --> 39:01.066
That is

39:02.100 --> 39:04.033
an extremely precise
remote-controlled detonator

39:05.500 --> 39:07.667
that can explode a uranium sphere.

39:09.567 --> 39:10.433
Iris is planning

39:11.233 --> 39:13.000
on a nuclear terror attack in Seoul

39:14.500 --> 39:16.700
in order to stop the summit.

39:18.300 --> 39:21.500
Stopping the attack and revealing
who's responsible for the attack

39:22.567 --> 39:26.800
are what we should do now.

39:36.767 --> 39:37.700
Gosh.

39:38.800 --> 39:39.967
It's not easy.

39:44.300 --> 39:45.266
I feel like

39:46.367 --> 39:48.300
we failed to fully penetrate our opinions.

39:48.834 --> 39:51.200
Isn't it the same in the South as well?

39:52.233 --> 39:54.600
There are people who oppose the plan
not only in the ruling party

39:55.233 --> 39:56.433
but also in the Blue House.

39:58.467 --> 40:00.734
What is your opinion?

40:01.834 --> 40:05.200
I'm just putting my utmost effort
to assure the security during the summit.

40:06.333 --> 40:09.767
You know the NSS never makes

40:10.934 --> 40:11.834
any political judgement.

40:12.834 --> 40:14.967
You never do that?

40:25.300 --> 40:26.667
They want to resume the talks.

40:27.867 --> 40:28.934
Okay. Let's go in, then.

40:34.500 --> 40:38.000
Then, let's decide
the venue of the summit first.

40:38.567 --> 40:40.166
How about holding it in Seoul

40:40.633 --> 40:42.133
as a return visit,

40:42.834 --> 40:44.700
just like we've suggested earlier?

40:45.433 --> 40:46.934
You want to hold it in Seoul

40:48.133 --> 40:49.433
before the end of this year.

40:51.433 --> 40:52.967
Isn't it too tight?

40:53.367 --> 40:56.967
We'll do our best to assure the security.

40:57.734 --> 41:00.467
We will accept your suggestions
as much as possible.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.300
If you plan to accept our suggestions,

41:06.367 --> 41:07.867
can we include 200 agents

41:08.633 --> 41:10.367
from our Supreme Guard in the delegation?

41:10.934 --> 41:12.433
During both the first and second summits,

41:12.767 --> 41:15.567
we had less than 50 guards.

41:16.066 --> 41:19.033
They possessed a revolver only
upon your request.

41:19.867 --> 41:22.066
Why do you need that many security guards?

41:22.600 --> 41:23.767
I already told you

41:25.033 --> 41:26.767
that Seoul is far different
from Pyeongyang

41:26.834 --> 41:29.200
where we have exclusive driveways
and control every single window.

41:39.033 --> 41:39.967
I have no idea

41:40.533 --> 41:42.834
if they really want to hold the summit.

41:43.533 --> 41:44.834
Their request isn't just demanding,

41:45.767 --> 41:47.100
but almost unreasonable.

41:47.567 --> 41:48.633
I expected

41:49.433 --> 41:51.633
they'd make such inordinate demands,

41:52.400 --> 41:55.400
as I heard what happened
in the first and second summits.

41:56.166 --> 41:58.667
Isn't it impossible to hold it
within the year?

41:59.667 --> 42:01.834
As President Cho is firmly determined,

42:02.734 --> 42:06.467
and there are problems in maintaining
the security of our neighboring countries,

42:07.633 --> 42:09.734
we must put this through no matter what.

42:10.133 --> 42:13.100
In my opinion,
they have an ulterior motive.

42:14.066 --> 42:16.867
I think they're trying to avoid
the talks about the nuclear development

42:16.934 --> 42:18.667
President Cho is planning to have.

42:25.200 --> 42:28.633
Please sum up today's meeting
and report to the Blue House.

42:29.266 --> 42:32.467
I also need you to check
when I can talk to President Cho.

42:33.000 --> 42:33.900
Yes, sir.

43:15.100 --> 43:17.867
Ma'am, you'll put us in trouble as well.

43:18.767 --> 43:20.166
Director Baek even made a special order

43:20.333 --> 43:21.967
to keep you away from the case.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.133
You can't be here.

43:25.266 --> 43:26.333
How far has it gone?

43:26.400 --> 43:28.333
The field investigation is still going on.
About 60%--

43:28.400 --> 43:29.233
Hey.

43:29.767 --> 43:30.633
What's the matter?

43:31.033 --> 43:32.734
Making the list is her idea after all.

43:33.367 --> 43:34.333
If you keep doing this,

43:34.400 --> 43:35.800
we'll get in serious trouble.

43:40.233 --> 43:41.900
Don't you think you're too mean?

43:42.133 --> 43:42.967
No way.

43:43.266 --> 43:44.700
You'd also better think rationally.

44:17.066 --> 44:18.533
You're Director Baek, right?

45:02.033 --> 45:07.166
People usually become more skillful
and wiser as they get old,

45:08.834 --> 45:10.467
but I guess that's not the case
for everyone.

45:11.266 --> 45:14.967
You've come this far because you failed
to get rid of Seung-ryong Hong.

45:17.433 --> 45:18.667
I'm still young.

45:20.233 --> 45:21.667
And you can't fully hold us accountable

45:22.500 --> 45:23.767
for losing Hyun-jun Kim.

45:25.533 --> 45:28.066
The same error must not be repeated ever.

45:29.367 --> 45:31.734
The headquarters won't overlook
the mistake again.

45:35.066 --> 45:37.400
The thing that is happening in Korea,

45:38.734 --> 45:40.100
are you behind it?

45:43.467 --> 45:44.367
Yes.

45:44.433 --> 45:45.533
Are you really going

45:46.767 --> 45:49.266
to detonate a nuclear bomb
at the center of Seoul?

45:49.467 --> 45:52.433
It's an order from the above.
I have no choice.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.233
We couldn't contact you
before we invaded the NSS

45:58.033 --> 45:59.867
to maintain our security.
I hope you understand.

46:01.033 --> 46:03.033
How far has it gone?

46:03.834 --> 46:04.767
They must have combined

46:05.734 --> 46:07.266
the enriched uranium sphere

46:08.200 --> 46:10.166
and the detonator by now.

46:11.333 --> 46:13.600
We must set a D-day before the summit

46:14.900 --> 46:15.967
and carry it out.

46:22.333 --> 46:24.567
An envoy from the South absconded.

46:25.900 --> 46:26.800
Who is it?

46:26.867 --> 46:29.300
It's San Baek, Director of the NSS.

46:30.266 --> 46:33.133
He's meeting with Commissioner Yeon now.

46:34.433 --> 46:37.400
Don't we have to find out
why they're together?

46:38.734 --> 46:40.934
We can't even wiretap the place
they're in.

46:42.767 --> 46:43.867
There's no way.

46:45.133 --> 46:47.266
Give an instruction to keep a close eye
on San Baek.

46:47.433 --> 46:48.266
Yes, sir.

46:48.333 --> 46:49.400
As for us,

46:50.300 --> 46:52.800
we'll go to Seoul with the envoys
from the South.

46:53.233 --> 46:54.467
We'll take charge

46:55.533 --> 46:57.533
of guard in Seoul before the summit.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.066
Yes, sir.

47:03.533 --> 47:04.433
Iris is planning

47:05.333 --> 47:07.000
a nuclear terror in Seoul

47:08.567 --> 47:10.734
to stop the inter-Korean summit.

47:11.834 --> 47:13.033
Preventing the nuclear terror

47:13.633 --> 47:15.100
and finding out who's behind them

47:16.200 --> 47:20.333
are what you and I should do now.

48:00.100 --> 48:01.100
Where is Captain?

48:02.767 --> 48:04.333
He went out to move something.

48:05.533 --> 48:06.400
To where?

48:06.533 --> 48:07.500
I don't know.

48:09.567 --> 48:10.500
Do you know

48:12.133 --> 48:13.033
what that is?

48:13.166 --> 48:14.333
No, I don't.

48:15.734 --> 48:17.433
Why is everyone so curious about it?

48:31.367 --> 48:32.233
Kwang-su!

48:32.300 --> 48:33.266
Hey!

48:34.567 --> 48:35.500
It's been so long.

48:44.033 --> 48:45.266
What should we do?

48:47.100 --> 48:48.200
There's no need to hurry.

48:48.333 --> 48:49.467
You'll see soon.

48:50.567 --> 48:51.467
Take a rest for now.

49:04.667 --> 49:05.500
Jeong-in.

49:06.567 --> 49:07.400
Yes.

49:07.967 --> 49:08.800
I'm sorry.

49:08.867 --> 49:09.734
For what?

49:10.433 --> 49:12.934
I heard that you were suspended
because of me.

49:13.333 --> 49:14.300
Don't worry.

49:15.100 --> 49:17.100
Seung-hee, stop what you're doing now,

49:17.400 --> 49:19.500
and report it officially
and request an investigation.

49:20.533 --> 49:22.133
It'd be better for the NSS to investigate

49:22.667 --> 49:23.967
the manipulated data from Hungary

49:24.433 --> 49:25.967
and other suspicious cases--

49:26.033 --> 49:28.433
No. I have to find Hyun-jun
before anyone else does.

49:28.900 --> 49:29.734
Then what?

49:30.567 --> 49:32.000
What will you do if you find him?

49:32.400 --> 49:34.934
If it really was Hyun-jun
who you saw in the archive,

49:35.567 --> 49:38.100
that means he's become a terrorist now.

49:38.166 --> 49:41.400
He's our enemy who attacked the NSS
and murdered our colleagues.

49:41.467 --> 49:42.934
That's why I must meet with him.

49:43.800 --> 49:44.734
I need to know

49:45.900 --> 49:47.600
why he came back as a terrorist now

49:49.533 --> 49:51.233
and what happened to him.

49:53.500 --> 49:56.166
I can't help you anymore.

49:57.834 --> 49:58.967
You should do it alone.

50:21.166 --> 50:22.233
Sir.

50:23.066 --> 50:23.967
What is it?

50:25.200 --> 50:26.266
Can I use your computer?

50:26.333 --> 50:28.066
What happened to yours?

50:28.166 --> 50:29.367
You know what I'm going through.

50:31.934 --> 50:34.033
-Keep quiet, then.
-Okay.

51:14.200 --> 51:15.100
No one's here.

51:17.734 --> 51:18.567
Where's the next one?

51:18.633 --> 51:19.734
It's in Bucheon.

51:20.100 --> 51:21.066
Get moving.

51:21.133 --> 51:22.000
Move.

52:41.066 --> 52:42.400
Did you hear anything from the field?

52:42.467 --> 52:43.467
They're still investigating.

52:47.000 --> 52:47.900
Yes.

52:48.667 --> 52:49.567
Did you find anything?

52:49.633 --> 52:50.867
No, sir.

52:52.500 --> 52:53.400
How many are left to go?

52:53.500 --> 52:54.567
The next one is the last one.

52:54.867 --> 52:55.734
Okay.

52:55.800 --> 52:57.667
-Report immediately when you're done.
-Yes, sir.

53:08.800 --> 53:10.600
-Sir.
-What now?

53:10.667 --> 53:13.066
Could you log in so that I can access
the satellite image server?

53:14.867 --> 53:15.834
The satellite?

53:16.667 --> 53:19.467
You're really annoying me.

53:20.033 --> 53:20.900
I'm sorry.

53:35.533 --> 53:36.467
What are you looking for?

53:36.533 --> 53:37.633
An asbestos warehouse.

53:38.967 --> 53:40.433
There's a missing one from the list.

53:40.567 --> 53:43.467
It handled actinolite,

53:44.300 --> 53:46.233
and its location and size fit
the condition.

53:46.567 --> 53:48.633
And it's been deserted since 2005
when it was shut down.

53:50.000 --> 53:50.934
Please take a look.

53:54.400 --> 53:55.934
Aren't those vans?

54:01.400 --> 54:02.233
Thank you.

54:06.700 --> 54:08.433
If the scope is extended
to the whole nation,

54:08.500 --> 54:09.700
how many subjects do we get?

54:10.300 --> 54:11.934
It's more than 70 at least.

54:12.600 --> 54:13.600
As the area got larger,

54:13.667 --> 54:15.333
the investigation will take
many times longer.

54:17.266 --> 54:19.100
We're running out of time,
it's getting worse.

54:20.333 --> 54:22.667
Use the satellite images
and narrow them down.

54:28.333 --> 54:29.433
What is this?

54:30.433 --> 54:32.967
Secretary Oh just accessed
the satellite server.

54:33.367 --> 54:34.400
Check what he did.

54:37.767 --> 54:39.500
Charlie Golf 241 5227.

54:40.066 --> 54:41.133
It seems like a warehouse.

54:41.567 --> 54:42.900
It's located in Seoksu, Anyang.

54:43.767 --> 54:44.934
Is it included in the list?

54:45.000 --> 54:46.734
List number C24-03...

54:48.600 --> 54:50.600
It's excluded from the list
due to its low possibility.

55:07.333 --> 55:08.200
What?

55:09.633 --> 55:10.767
I'm freaking busy!

55:23.233 --> 55:24.133
Where are you now?

55:24.700 --> 55:25.934
We're still investigating.

55:26.500 --> 55:27.700
I'll send you a location.

55:27.767 --> 55:29.100
Head to the place with the SWAT.

55:29.533 --> 55:30.667
It's in Seoksu, Anyang.

55:31.400 --> 55:33.767
I have a hunch this time.
Tell them not to lower their guards.

55:34.367 --> 55:35.266
Yes, sir.

55:37.767 --> 55:38.734
Did anything happen?

55:39.900 --> 55:40.767
It's nothing.

55:40.867 --> 55:41.867
Continue the investigation.

55:41.934 --> 55:42.900
Yes, sir.

55:55.700 --> 55:58.133
SA-WOO JIN

56:00.667 --> 56:02.000
The location has been discovered.

56:12.333 --> 56:13.800
SECRETARY SANG-HYUN PARK

56:17.700 --> 56:18.633
Shit.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.133
Why are you so slow?

56:24.200 --> 56:25.400
I'm connecting to the server now.

56:30.066 --> 56:31.500
C24-03?

56:33.433 --> 56:35.567
I arranged ones with
the highest possibility from the top.

56:35.734 --> 56:39.333
Storage C24-03 in Seoksu, Anyang,

56:39.400 --> 56:40.767
seems to be the prime place for now.

56:40.834 --> 56:41.700
Good job.

56:43.367 --> 56:45.266
Send it to me.

57:04.133 --> 57:06.867
SANG-HYUN PARK

57:10.133 --> 57:11.533
Yes, we're on our way.

57:11.834 --> 57:12.767
There's a problem.

57:13.100 --> 57:15.133
Seung-hee's heading out there
and can't be reached now.

57:15.533 --> 57:16.633
Get there as fast as you can.

57:32.266 --> 57:33.333
Yes, sir.

57:40.100 --> 57:41.033
Gather around.

57:45.633 --> 57:46.734
We're exposed.

57:47.500 --> 57:48.567
Remove all the traces

57:49.033 --> 57:50.333
and evacuate in ten minutes.

57:51.367 --> 57:52.367
Get to it!

1:00:34.333 --> 1:00:35.467
Keep in mind

1:00:35.533 --> 1:00:37.600
that your choice can never be justified.

1:00:37.667 --> 1:00:39.000
Shut up and answer my question.

1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:41.967
NEXT EPISODE

1:00:42.400 --> 1:00:43.367
Inject her with the drug.

1:00:44.934 --> 1:00:46.567
Something unexpected came up.

1:00:48.066 --> 1:00:49.934
Are you trying to declare
a war against the South?

1:00:52.433 --> 1:00:53.266
It's me.

1:00:55.033 --> 1:00:57.400
The defense system against
a nuclear terrorism has been activated.

1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:00.967
I think there's a spy in the NSS.

1:01:01.333 --> 1:01:02.467
Is there anyone you suspect?

1:01:02.533 --> 1:01:03.500
It's Sa-woo Jin.

1:01:04.500 --> 1:01:05.834
For the past 30 years,

1:01:05.900 --> 1:01:07.734
he's been fighting against the NSS.

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:09.033
Track him down.

1:01:11.166 --> 1:01:12.066
I can't reach him.

1:01:12.133 --> 1:01:13.000
I have a bad feeling.
