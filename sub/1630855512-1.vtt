WEBVTT

03:19.199 --> 03:21.723
- Oh, shit.

03:21.723 --> 03:24.334
Beth, you scared me.

03:24.334 --> 03:27.119
I told you
not to come up here alone.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.513
Why? I knew
what I was looking for.

03:29.513 --> 03:30.993
I was just trying to
save you some time.

03:30.993 --> 03:33.343
I know. I just--
it's-- this is...

03:33.343 --> 03:35.215
What?

03:37.739 --> 03:40.785
It's my home, okay?
My things...

03:40.785 --> 03:43.310
Well, these aren't.
These are all of ours.

03:43.310 --> 03:46.487
Fine, but
it's just [scoffs]...

03:46.487 --> 03:48.228
It's not that safe up here.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.404
I know what I'm doing,
you don't so...

03:52.144 --> 03:53.581
Oh, my god.

03:53.581 --> 03:56.671
I'm-- I'm not-- I'm not here
for your wine collection.

03:56.671 --> 03:59.717
I... I came to look
at the trunk,

03:59.717 --> 04:00.675
get the things.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.720
I was closing it
and you came up.

04:02.720 --> 04:03.678
Yeah.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.029
What is your point, Beth?

04:07.029 --> 04:09.074
Because you always have one.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.903
Just that...
it's my house.

04:11.903 --> 04:13.949
You should let me do it.
I know where things are.

04:16.343 --> 04:19.171
Okay. Shit.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.434
Whatever.

04:20.434 --> 04:22.305
And can you not swear
around my daughter?

04:22.305 --> 04:23.437
Please.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.484
She's not even here.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.138
She's not even in the house.

04:29.138 --> 04:29.921
Didn't Trent take her to his
parents' house for the weekend?

04:29.921 --> 04:31.532
Yes, I know, but you do.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.490
I mean, you have in the past

04:33.490 --> 04:36.145
so I'm just saying,
in general,

04:36.145 --> 04:37.407
please refrain.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.455
Yes.

04:42.804 --> 04:43.805
Yes.

04:48.462 --> 04:49.593
Are you coming?

04:50.812 --> 04:53.467
Yeah, just want to
straighten this out.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.599
Straighten what out?

04:55.599 --> 04:57.949
Just... the mess
you made.

04:59.429 --> 05:01.605
Oh, for fuck--

05:02.693 --> 05:05.783
Cool. You do that.
I'm gonna go get the...

05:25.977 --> 05:27.022
It can be a body thing
and a face thing.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.763
-  But also...
-  Yeah.

05:28.763 --> 05:32.462
Yeah, like the face thing
is [indistinct].

05:32.462 --> 05:34.856
Yeah, I've
heard about that.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.904
That's actually
a good name.

05:39.904 --> 05:40.862
Hi.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.782
Hi there, guys.
How you doing?

05:47.782 --> 05:52.003
We're good, Tess.
How've you been?

05:52.003 --> 05:54.702
Good. Everything's great.

05:54.702 --> 05:57.531
Yeah, Beth said, uh,
what chip did you get?

05:57.531 --> 05:59.837
How many months was it?
Was it six or nine?

05:59.837 --> 06:00.795
Six?

06:02.666 --> 06:07.541
What? It's...
it's a good thing, right?

06:07.541 --> 06:09.020
I'm sorry.
Was it a secret?

06:09.020 --> 06:11.371
No, it's not a secret.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.417
No, it's a good thing.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.811
And yes, it's been six months.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.509
She's teaching
a defense class...

06:19.509 --> 06:22.164
in Hollywood at the Y.

06:22.164 --> 06:24.384
Isn't that awesome?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.429
I'm not teaching
in Hollywood at all

06:26.429 --> 06:28.518
or at the Y.

06:28.518 --> 06:31.347
But I am teaching
at Baldwin Hills.

06:31.347 --> 06:33.697
It's an elementary school.
It's fun.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.612
I'm like Mister Miyagi
with tits.

06:41.052 --> 06:44.099
What's not landing for you?
Miyagi or tits?

06:45.927 --> 06:48.408
One's from <i>The Karate Kid</i>
and the other one's...

06:48.408 --> 06:49.409
you know.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.846
You got 'em, you know.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.587
Uh, well,
we're gonna go freshen up

06:53.587 --> 06:55.458
before we hit the road,
if that's all right?

06:55.458 --> 06:56.981
- Yeah, of course.
-  Cool.

07:03.248 --> 07:04.598
We'll leave soon.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.866
You invited them here
to the house?

07:11.866 --> 07:13.258
Yeah.

07:13.258 --> 07:14.390
I thought we said
we were going to drive together.

07:14.390 --> 07:17.001
Alone.
- We-- we can.

07:17.001 --> 07:18.873
I just said
they could go with us

07:18.873 --> 07:21.179
in one car to make it easy,
but if that's not okay,

07:21.179 --> 07:22.616
we can just--
- God...

07:24.008 --> 07:25.619
What?

07:25.619 --> 07:28.360
Nothing. You just never do
what you say, that's all.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.929
Oh, please...
look who's talking.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.670
The flakiest flake
in fucking Flake Town.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.237
Oh, oh, Beth.
We can't swear.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.456
There's children.

07:37.631 --> 07:40.547
The farm
is in the middle of nowhere.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.200
- Really?
- Yeah, it is.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.854
Okay?
- Hm.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.508
I don't even know why Rose
wanted to go there

07:45.508 --> 07:46.944
but she did.

07:46.944 --> 07:49.556
So I said, "Great. Okay, fine"
and made it happen,

07:49.556 --> 07:51.949
but it's not exactly
some fun little getaway.

07:51.949 --> 07:53.298
Can we not fight

07:53.298 --> 07:57.041
about every single thing, please?

07:57.041 --> 07:58.521
Sure.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.131
I mean, who cares?
It's-- it's just a--

08:00.131 --> 08:03.308
I care.
I don't like them.

08:03.308 --> 08:04.788
You don't like anybody.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.618
You hate my friends
and Rose's friends.

08:08.618 --> 08:11.012
You don't have any friends
of your own, so no luck there.

08:11.012 --> 08:14.102
Who is it that you actually
do like, Tess?

08:14.102 --> 08:16.452
Remind me.

08:16.452 --> 08:17.714
I don't know.
I think I used to like you,

08:17.714 --> 08:20.500
but that was a long time ago.

08:24.112 --> 08:27.071
You can be
such a bitch sometimes.

08:27.071 --> 08:28.072
Thanks.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.554
Right, who's driving,
you or me?

08:37.038 --> 08:39.519
Just remember,
it's not a race, all right?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.782
Please don't lose them
the first chance you get.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.697
Oh, them?
No. I promise.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.631
That is bullshit.
He's crazy.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.894
I never said that
I would do that.

09:06.894 --> 09:10.941
No, I didn't.
No, I did not.

09:10.941 --> 09:12.856
Okay, maybe I did.
But not with him.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.815
Do we want vodka, too
or...?

09:14.815 --> 09:16.556
Yeah. Duh.
I mean, it's a party.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.296
Somebody's gonna want vodka.

09:18.296 --> 09:19.602
What? No, not you.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.604
I'm talking to Esther.
My best friend Esther.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.127
Who is that?

09:23.127 --> 09:24.172
Can I just finish?

09:25.826 --> 09:27.871
No, no, no,
that's Jasmine.

09:27.871 --> 09:30.613
My other best friend.
No, this is Esther.

09:30.613 --> 09:31.788
No, you haven't met her.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.747
It's-- seriously,
it doesn't matter.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.707
Sebastian,
can I just please...

09:39.230 --> 09:42.016
Hi. Oh, my gosh.
You guys look so great.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.845
Yay. What's up?

09:44.845 --> 09:46.586
Nothing.
Just getting supplies.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.152
Just like you. Whoo.

09:48.152 --> 09:50.459
It's wine o'clock somewhere,
am I right?

09:50.459 --> 09:51.982
Come on!
It's a party.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.636
Is it though?

09:53.636 --> 09:55.116
Have you seen where we're going?
It's in the middle of nowhere

09:55.116 --> 09:57.248
and it's-- no offense,
but it's a kind of a dump.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.424
No, it's old.

09:59.424 --> 10:01.775
It's charming.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.255
Rose and I used to go there
as kids like all the time.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.561
Almost every summer.

10:05.561 --> 10:06.997
Yeah, but who has her
bridal-whatever-thingy

10:06.997 --> 10:09.913
at a farm in the desert?
I mean, come on.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.568
Excuse me. It's not
a bridal-whatever-thingy.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.265
It's a bachelorette party.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.615
There's a huge difference.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.660
Yeah. Duh.
What's the difference?

10:17.660 --> 10:20.271
Ummm, no grandmas
or little kids and shit.

10:20.271 --> 10:21.621
Okay, this is what Rose wants.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.667
Just us having fun
and getting wasted.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.974
-  Yeah.
-  Yes, yes.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.760
Sorry.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.762
Cleanup on aisle four.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.590
I see Mia hasn't
changed much.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.810
Yeah, pretty much.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.159
But she'll be fine.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.030
I mean, she's better
when she's a little drunk.

10:40.030 --> 10:40.857
Or high.

10:40.857 --> 10:41.989
Or just been fucked.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.645
What? I never fucked her.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.602
Uhhh...

10:46.602 --> 10:48.735
What? I didn't.

10:48.735 --> 10:51.346
I mean, not since school.

10:51.346 --> 10:53.130
- I knew it. I knew it.
- What?

10:53.130 --> 10:54.871
I knew it.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.960
Ladies, snacks?
Esther, come on.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.353
[chuckling] On chips.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.703
- Whoa!

11:00.703 --> 11:02.749
What's gonna go
with mac and cheese?

11:02.749 --> 11:05.316
Hey, cutie.

11:05.316 --> 11:06.709
Need some help with that?

11:06.709 --> 11:08.668
Yeah, you know,
if you want a ride,

11:08.668 --> 11:10.408
our truck's right outside.

11:10.408 --> 11:11.801
Come for a ride.

11:11.801 --> 11:13.760
You know, thanks.
We're good.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.022
What about you, sweetheart?

11:16.197 --> 11:19.374
You looking for
something special?

11:19.374 --> 11:21.463
No, I'm-- I'm good.

11:21.463 --> 11:22.638
I don't think we got

11:22.638 --> 11:24.335
one of them international
aisles here, so.

11:26.033 --> 11:28.731
Oh, and then there were three.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.740
You boys just taking
a break from getting shit-faced

11:37.740 --> 11:40.917
or are you excited to look at
someone other than your sister?

11:43.093 --> 11:44.355
Well, there's no harm
in looking now,

11:44.355 --> 11:46.880
is there, sweetheart? Hm?

11:46.880 --> 11:48.533
Depends, I guess.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.492
Yeah, well,
we're not looking at you.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.363
So why don't you move on?

11:52.363 --> 11:53.364
For sure.

11:55.192 --> 11:56.280
Hey, you should take
that cap off

11:56.280 --> 11:58.239
if you didn't serve.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.719
And I know you didn't.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.981
I did.

12:03.548 --> 12:06.116
I served.
I gave it to him.

12:06.116 --> 12:09.729
No way.
Where'd you serve?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.253
Ramstein.
86th Airlift Wing.

12:12.253 --> 12:15.778
Oh, I thought you said
you "“served."”

12:15.778 --> 12:17.084
My mistake.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.259
Fuck you.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.435
I bet you don't even know
where that is.

12:20.435 --> 12:21.828
Not exactly, but I--

12:21.828 --> 12:23.960
I think it's in
southwestern Germany, right?

12:23.960 --> 12:25.745
About 15 clicks east of K-Town

12:25.745 --> 12:27.834
and three clicks
west of Landstuhl?

12:31.011 --> 12:33.796
Oh, I know why
you look familiar now.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.537
Are you one of the guys
who changed my bedpan

12:35.537 --> 12:38.235
when I got medevacked there?

12:38.235 --> 12:40.237
I almost missed it.

12:40.237 --> 12:41.238
Bullshit.

12:41.238 --> 12:42.413
Bullshit?

12:42.413 --> 12:43.980
I was an MP,
for your info, all right?

12:43.980 --> 12:46.026
That's Military Police.

12:46.026 --> 12:46.983
Wow.

12:46.983 --> 12:49.072
Where you medevacked from?

12:49.072 --> 12:50.204
Fallujah.

12:51.466 --> 12:53.947
That's, uh, that's in Iraq,
for you boys.

12:55.687 --> 12:58.429
Nah. No fucking way,
you're too young.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.954
No. Third battle. 2016.

13:02.738 --> 13:05.610
No, because we didn't
have any troops in that, bitch.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.787
No, we had advisors
from 2014 on.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.093
Who do you think was
protecting them, asshole?

13:10.093 --> 13:12.356
People like me,
who were in the actual shit.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.576
Not people like you, who were
skipping around Europe

13:14.576 --> 13:16.099
enjoying Oktoberfest.

13:16.099 --> 13:18.754
You better watch
your fucking mouth.

13:18.754 --> 13:19.799
You're probably right.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.932
You think
you're tough, huh?

13:22.932 --> 13:24.891
I mean,
I'm tough enough, I guess.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.936
Yeah. Why don't we
find out how tough?

13:28.242 --> 13:29.373
Tess?

13:31.985 --> 13:33.247
You know,
I would love to.

13:33.247 --> 13:35.510
I just... I gotta
get to a party.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.904
So maybe another time.

13:52.135 --> 13:53.397
We'll see you there.

13:53.397 --> 13:56.139
Okay, great.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.749
I'm surprised
they even had wine.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.981
Hey, do we even know
who the caretakers are anymore?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.199
I don't.

16:23.199 --> 16:25.375
Me either, but I called
and left a message

16:25.375 --> 16:27.203
like we're supposed to
when we use the house.

16:27.203 --> 16:28.639
I thought
it was an older couple.

16:28.639 --> 16:29.814
A man and a woman.

16:29.814 --> 16:33.557
No, that was... is it?

16:33.557 --> 16:35.298
Dad keeps losing people
so I'm not even sure.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.517
I think these guys have been

16:36.517 --> 16:38.345
here for a while now.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.613
I'll walk down later
and introduce myself.

16:45.613 --> 16:46.962
Or I can.

16:46.962 --> 16:48.920
I know you want to get
started with the party.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.052
Either way.

16:52.533 --> 16:55.362
Maybe better if it's me since
I'm the one who contacted them

16:55.362 --> 16:57.146
for the party and everything.

17:04.458 --> 17:05.372
Uh-uh.

17:09.070 --> 17:13.075
I love it here.
Great vibes.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.598
I told you so.

17:14.598 --> 17:15.643
Yes, you did.

17:19.603 --> 17:20.909
Look at that.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.084
I'm looking.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.348
I bet you are.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.243
Mm-hm.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.078
Or you don't have to
wear a push-up bra.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.297
That's why
I got [indistinct].

18:01.297 --> 18:02.733
There's only 150
since [indistinct].

18:13.266 --> 18:14.223
- Oh.
- Come on, bitch.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.138
Let's have some fun.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.444
Oh, this is me having fun.

18:17.444 --> 18:18.271
Oh.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.403
Sorry.

18:20.403 --> 18:24.103
I'm just daydreaming
for whatever reason.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.453
Oh, it's okay.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.846
Hey, it's...
it's really good to see you.

18:28.846 --> 18:31.327
You too.

18:31.327 --> 18:34.809
Okay, who wants me
to do a reading?

18:34.809 --> 18:35.897
Oh, me!

18:35.897 --> 18:36.985
Aahh.

18:36.985 --> 18:38.291
Come on.
Let's pull a card.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.259
No.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.304
No, thank you.

18:51.304 --> 18:52.566
Sorry, no, thank you.

18:52.566 --> 18:56.787
Hey, Tessie.
Who's your favorite sister?

18:56.787 --> 18:59.181
Come on, say it.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.096
Hey.
- You are.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.185
Hey, middle sis.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.186
Hi, little sis.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.753
Thanks for coming.

19:05.753 --> 19:09.017
I know this isn't your kind of
thing, so thank you.

19:09.017 --> 19:11.193
Honestly.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.803
Of course.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.283
Hey, Tess.

19:14.283 --> 19:16.677
You still out there making
America great again?

19:16.677 --> 19:18.244
Maybe.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.550
You still out there letting
third graders do your hair?

19:20.550 --> 19:22.987
Braids are very in
right now.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.119
I mean...

19:24.119 --> 19:25.729
I like these.

19:25.729 --> 19:26.948
Bitch.

19:26.948 --> 19:27.949
How's life?

19:27.949 --> 19:28.993
All good.

19:28.993 --> 19:31.300
Working, partying.

19:34.912 --> 19:36.827
This is gonna be fun, right?

19:36.827 --> 19:39.090
Oh, yeah.
Yes, of course.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.135
- Okay.
- Look at you.

19:40.135 --> 19:42.137
- Bride-to-be.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.269
Could you be cuter?

19:43.269 --> 19:44.357
Look at your body.

19:44.357 --> 19:47.577
Ugh, no. Look at you!

19:47.577 --> 19:49.405
You're fit as shit.
Seriously, Tess.

19:49.405 --> 19:50.406
- Well, yeah.
- What the hell?

19:50.406 --> 19:52.060
One addiction for another.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.844
Come here,
you fucking cutie.

19:53.844 --> 19:56.891
-  Beth!
-  You fucking cutie!

19:58.545 --> 20:01.156
Hello!

21:09.268 --> 21:10.443
Hello?

22:07.587 --> 22:11.068
No. Seriously, let's get it
done tonight.

22:11.068 --> 22:12.243
It's what we said we'd do.

22:12.243 --> 22:14.333
It makes me nervous
if we don't...

22:14.333 --> 22:15.856
got too many guys
we've been using lately,

22:15.856 --> 22:17.336
too many big mouths,

22:17.336 --> 22:19.816
plus, we got those new people
moving in come Monday.

22:19.816 --> 22:22.253
Let's get it out of there
tonight or move it at least.

22:22.253 --> 22:23.385
Fine.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.779
Shit. I gotta
run back into town,

22:25.779 --> 22:28.347
grab some trash bags.
You wanna come with?

22:28.347 --> 22:30.131
Uh, yeah.
Start the truck.

22:30.131 --> 22:31.828
I gotta take a piss.

22:31.828 --> 22:32.829
All right.

22:42.448 --> 22:43.666
Who's this?

22:45.320 --> 22:47.017
Oh. [chuckles] Yes.

22:47.017 --> 22:48.018
Sorry about that.

22:48.018 --> 22:50.238
Yeah. Hello?

22:50.238 --> 22:52.545
Hello?

22:52.545 --> 22:54.547
Yeah, I hear you.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.810
Sorry, the reception
is bad here.

22:56.810 --> 22:59.334
No, we got your message
about you and the party.

22:59.334 --> 23:02.119
Is everything okay?
That's great.

23:04.295 --> 23:06.602
Your sister? No.

23:06.602 --> 23:09.431
Nobody has been
down here today.

23:09.431 --> 23:10.954
Not that I know of.

23:13.087 --> 23:15.698
Uh, if I see her, I will.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.526
I'm just heading into town.

23:17.526 --> 23:20.094
You-- you ladies need anything?

23:20.094 --> 23:21.225
No?

23:21.225 --> 23:23.227
All right, have fun.

23:23.227 --> 23:25.447
You too.

23:25.447 --> 23:26.927
Take care.

23:28.145 --> 23:29.886
"Take care."
Shut the fuck up.

24:28.597 --> 24:29.642
All right.

24:29.642 --> 24:30.860
Oh, my god.

24:30.860 --> 24:33.907
Have you given
a hand job to someone

24:33.907 --> 24:36.039
who you were not
very attracted to?

24:36.039 --> 24:38.041
Why would I? No.

24:44.657 --> 24:46.528
Who are you?

24:46.528 --> 24:48.138
I'm sorry?

24:48.138 --> 24:50.140
Who are you?

24:50.140 --> 24:51.533
I'm the chef...

24:51.533 --> 24:52.839
for tonight.

24:52.839 --> 24:53.840
A chef?

24:56.886 --> 24:58.235
Yeah. Okay.

24:59.715 --> 25:00.890
That's fine, I guess.

25:00.890 --> 25:02.065
You guess?

25:02.979 --> 25:04.503
You are a funny one.

25:06.330 --> 25:07.288
You have no idea.

25:09.899 --> 25:10.726
Tess.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.162
- Hey.

25:12.162 --> 25:13.163
Where you been?

25:14.425 --> 25:18.038
In here, giving me
the third degree.

25:18.038 --> 25:19.169
That's not true.

25:19.169 --> 25:21.345
I was asking him who he was.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.391
I didn't see him
when I went outside

25:23.391 --> 25:26.089
and then I come in and there's
these knives everywhere and...

25:26.089 --> 25:27.700
yeah.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.397
Can I talk to you
for a second?

25:34.010 --> 25:34.968
Please.

25:36.099 --> 25:37.840
Okay, I'm on my way.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.929
I'll just prepare in here.

25:43.890 --> 25:45.021
Shot!

25:45.021 --> 25:46.153
Oh, my god.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.901
What, um, [clears throat].

25:54.901 --> 25:56.337
What-- what do you think
you're doing?

25:57.643 --> 25:58.774
What does that mean?

26:00.602 --> 26:03.866
I come into the kitchen
to check on the chef,

26:03.866 --> 26:07.783
and of course, I find you in
here in conflict with him,

26:07.783 --> 26:09.219
like with every other man

26:09.219 --> 26:12.048
walking the face of
the fucking planet.

26:12.048 --> 26:13.223
And because why?

26:13.223 --> 26:14.790
I'm sorry. I...

26:14.790 --> 26:16.096
I came in here and--

26:16.096 --> 26:20.404
and I didn't know
who he was and so I asked.

26:20.404 --> 26:21.580
That's it.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.277
He wasn't here when I left,
all right?

26:23.277 --> 26:24.539
Right. Yeah, yeah.

26:24.539 --> 26:27.194
Uh, left to go where?

26:27.194 --> 26:28.543
You know where.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.589
I said I would
take care of it.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.939
But no, you had to go
down there, didn't you?

26:32.939 --> 26:34.070
So what?

26:34.070 --> 26:36.595
Because I said
I'd take care of it.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.074
- And?
- And?

26:38.074 --> 26:39.641
And guess what?

26:39.641 --> 26:41.730
Everything is fine.

26:43.123 --> 26:45.168
No.

26:45.168 --> 26:48.084
There's something
strange about those guys.

26:48.084 --> 26:50.043
Oh, oh, really?

26:50.043 --> 26:53.916
Really? What's...
what's strange?

26:56.745 --> 26:59.530
Well, I went in,
um, and, uh--

26:59.530 --> 27:01.271
Sorry. You went--
you went in--

27:01.271 --> 27:03.056
in their house?

27:03.056 --> 27:04.579
Not their house.

27:04.579 --> 27:05.928
It's our house.
Our property.

27:05.928 --> 27:06.799
Still.

27:06.799 --> 27:08.452
But I'm sorry. I had to.

27:08.452 --> 27:09.671
They're suspicious.

27:11.499 --> 27:12.674
Says who?

27:12.674 --> 27:13.675
- Says me.
-  Okay.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.111
So, um, I called home

27:15.111 --> 27:17.113
and they're the guys
who were hired last year

27:17.113 --> 27:19.333
to help with the handover
of the property, okay?

27:19.333 --> 27:20.769
So [inhales] not murderers.

27:20.769 --> 27:23.467
- Wait, you spoke to Dad?
- Mm-hm.

27:23.467 --> 27:24.860
How did you call him?

27:24.860 --> 27:25.861
There's no landline here.

27:25.861 --> 27:27.167
It isn't working.
I checked.

27:27.167 --> 27:29.691
You are fucking insane,
do you know that?

27:29.691 --> 27:31.519
I leaned out the window
in the upper bedroom

27:31.519 --> 27:33.826
like we always used to do.

27:34.740 --> 27:35.871
Right.

27:38.700 --> 27:39.788
Listen to me.

27:39.788 --> 27:41.660
Just listen.
Please listen to me.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.009
Seriously.

27:44.227 --> 27:47.709
Your sister, our sister,

27:47.709 --> 27:49.668
is trying to have her
bachelorette party

27:49.668 --> 27:52.845
and this is what you want to do?

27:52.845 --> 27:56.631
Try and-- try and scare people?

27:56.631 --> 27:58.764
I'm sorry.

27:58.764 --> 28:01.244
But maybe
you should relax and...

28:01.244 --> 28:04.247
have a drink.

28:04.247 --> 28:05.640
Maybe that'd help.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.163
I'm sorry, what?

28:07.163 --> 28:08.121
You heard me.

28:10.514 --> 28:11.690
A little bit of alcohol.

28:13.822 --> 28:15.955
That's a real shit thing
to say to me, you know that?

28:15.955 --> 28:17.391
Just, uh...

28:17.391 --> 28:18.740
just call 'em like I see 'em.

28:24.224 --> 28:27.227
Thanks for dressing up,
by the way.

28:27.227 --> 28:28.315
It's really nice.

28:35.452 --> 28:36.845
There she is!

28:42.068 --> 28:43.156
Okay, okay, okay.

28:43.156 --> 28:47.377
Have you joined
the Mile High Club?

28:47.377 --> 28:48.509
Oh, she has.

28:48.509 --> 28:50.903
Oh, my gosh.

28:50.903 --> 28:53.209
Oh, my gosh. Okay.

28:53.209 --> 28:57.648
Have you ever had sex
on a carnival ride?

28:59.781 --> 29:01.696
Oh, my gosh.

29:01.696 --> 29:03.045
Duh.

29:04.917 --> 29:08.094
Have you hooked up
with an unattractive rich guy?

29:08.094 --> 29:09.922
Um, yes!

29:40.822 --> 29:41.954
Fuck it.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.614
Yeah, not today.

29:50.614 --> 29:51.877
Not today.

29:53.530 --> 29:54.444
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

29:54.444 --> 29:56.795
Shot! Shot!

30:11.810 --> 30:13.115
Ladies.

30:13.115 --> 30:14.725
-  Oohh!

30:14.725 --> 30:19.165
Hello, hello, hello.
My name is Alfonse

30:19.165 --> 30:20.470
and I've got some
treats for you ladies

30:20.470 --> 30:21.732
to get you guys started.

30:21.732 --> 30:22.821
Oh, my god.

30:22.821 --> 30:23.778
They're tiny little
dicks!

30:23.778 --> 30:24.779
Yes, they are.

30:24.779 --> 30:26.302
Yes, they are dicks.

30:26.302 --> 30:27.303
Yes, they are.

30:27.303 --> 30:28.391
Thank you.

30:28.391 --> 30:29.436
I think you should have
two dicks.

30:29.436 --> 30:30.350
I'll have two dicks in
my mouth.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.004
Two dicks in her mouth.

30:32.004 --> 30:34.833
Now, I'm not sure how much you
ladies know about this evening

30:34.833 --> 30:36.660
but we are going to
have a great time.

30:36.660 --> 30:37.966
I promise you that.

30:37.966 --> 30:39.794
I've got some beautiful
sea bass croquettes

30:39.794 --> 30:41.230
along with a few other treats

30:41.230 --> 30:42.884
and that's not even
talking about dessert.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.712
You know what I mean?
- I hope you're dessert.

30:44.712 --> 30:47.193
Oh my, my, my.

30:47.193 --> 30:49.325
Aren't you the
naughty little girl?

30:49.325 --> 30:50.500
Fuck yes, I am!

30:50.500 --> 30:53.982
- Yeah, she is.

30:53.982 --> 30:57.986
As luck would have it,
I'm a naughty little boy.

30:57.986 --> 31:00.684
So things might get a little interesting.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.213
Oh, my god!

31:08.954 --> 31:10.172
Whoa!

31:55.043 --> 31:57.567
- Hey, middle sis.
- Hey.

31:57.567 --> 31:59.352
My baby girl.

32:00.396 --> 32:01.920
What's going on?

32:03.443 --> 32:04.574
Hey, I'm sorry.

32:04.574 --> 32:06.054
I'm not trying to
ruin anything for you.

32:06.054 --> 32:09.666
- Oh, no, no. It's fine.
- I just need a little space.

32:09.666 --> 32:12.756
You're just missing
the stripper, that's all.

32:12.756 --> 32:14.758
The what?

32:14.758 --> 32:16.412
The stripper.

32:17.413 --> 32:18.762
Oh shit.

32:18.762 --> 32:20.460
The caterer guy? Oh, god.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.766
Exactly.

32:22.766 --> 32:24.116
He is also the entertainment.

32:24.116 --> 32:25.769
So gross.

32:25.769 --> 32:28.511
Yeah.

32:28.511 --> 32:29.948
I was very happy to
get out of there

32:29.948 --> 32:31.993
and let the others take a turn.

32:31.993 --> 32:34.039
Good girl.

32:37.259 --> 32:38.521
So...

32:39.653 --> 32:42.090
what's happening out here?

32:42.090 --> 32:44.527
Nothing. I just...

32:44.527 --> 32:48.618
just feels weird being back
here, that's all.

32:48.618 --> 32:49.880
You sure?

32:49.880 --> 32:51.056
Yeah, why?

32:53.972 --> 32:55.451
Do you want to talk
about it?

32:55.451 --> 32:56.452
No.

32:57.540 --> 32:58.498
It's your night.

33:02.589 --> 33:04.634
Oh, boy.
- Rose, I'm sorry about this.

33:06.027 --> 33:10.727
Sorry, Rose,

33:10.727 --> 33:12.991
that I even let you invite her.

33:17.082 --> 33:18.561
It's cold out.

33:18.561 --> 33:19.693
Come back inside.

33:19.693 --> 33:20.650
You don't have to comfort her.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.696
It's not your job.

33:22.696 --> 33:24.045
We're just talking, Beth.

33:24.045 --> 33:26.265
Yeah. Yeah,
like sisters do.

33:32.575 --> 33:36.449
Do you mind if your
fucking sister goes inside

33:36.449 --> 33:39.321
and enjoys the rest of
her fucking party

33:39.321 --> 33:41.410
that I put together for her?

33:41.410 --> 33:44.109
Or do you want to keep making
this all about you?

33:45.893 --> 33:46.981
Huh?

33:55.990 --> 33:57.557
- Open the door.

33:57.557 --> 33:58.906
Beth, open the door!

33:58.906 --> 34:00.081
Beth, go!

34:02.866 --> 34:04.085
What's going on?

34:04.085 --> 34:04.999
What's happening?
-  Oh, my god.

34:04.999 --> 34:06.827
Wait, what's happening?

34:06.827 --> 34:09.047
Beth, close the door.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.222
Beth.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.574
Oh, my god, Rose.

34:14.574 --> 34:15.487
Is that blood?

34:16.532 --> 34:18.360
Tess, what the fuck
is going on?

34:18.360 --> 34:20.362
Who the fuck is out there?

34:20.362 --> 34:21.885
-  Oh, my god, Rose.
- Beth.

34:21.885 --> 34:23.235
- Beth, Beth.

34:23.235 --> 34:24.888
I need you to get your phone.
Beth, look at me.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.411
I need you to call 911 or Dad.

34:26.411 --> 34:27.717
Whoever you can get a hold of, okay?

34:27.717 --> 34:29.284
Beth, look at me. Go now.

34:29.284 --> 34:30.458
I'll go. I'll go.

34:30.458 --> 34:31.851
I know the trick.
Out the window, right?

34:31.851 --> 34:32.983
Yeah, yeah.

34:32.983 --> 34:33.897
Rose and I
used to do that and I--

34:33.897 --> 34:36.552
Go, go, go, go.
Be careful.

34:36.552 --> 34:38.380
- Tess, what happened?
-  What is happening, Tess?

34:41.556 --> 34:42.384
Okay, okay, okay.

34:42.384 --> 34:43.907
Ladies, don't be afraid.

34:43.907 --> 34:46.562
This is what we are going to do.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.004
Tess,
what's happening?

34:54.004 --> 34:54.875
What are we doing?
-  Tess!

34:54.875 --> 34:55.831
What the fuck!

34:55.831 --> 34:56.920
Shut up.

34:58.748 --> 35:00.098
What the fuck.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.622
Oh, shit. Okay.

35:06.713 --> 35:07.888
Oh, shit.

35:24.818 --> 35:25.906
Okay.

35:25.906 --> 35:27.299
All right.

35:27.299 --> 35:28.822
We got to get the rest of
these doors locked, okay?

35:28.822 --> 35:29.823
Pull some shit up against them.

35:29.823 --> 35:31.216
Make sure they're blocked.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.652
All these lights have to go out.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.436
Unplug every single thing
you see upstairs and down.

35:34.436 --> 35:38.571
If they get in here, it needs to
be pitch dark, okay?

35:38.571 --> 35:40.616
Stay low.

35:40.616 --> 35:42.488
You guys start in here.
I'm gonna get the kitchen.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.577
Esther's upstairs
trying to call out.

36:28.577 --> 36:30.405
But I need all of you
to do the same.

36:30.405 --> 36:31.798
Grab your phones.
Call the police.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.103
Call 911.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.061
Call anyone you can get
ahold of, all right?

36:34.061 --> 36:35.193
Do it now.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.237
Who is it?

36:36.237 --> 36:38.021
Why are they doing this?

36:38.021 --> 36:39.371
I don't know.
Not yet.

36:39.371 --> 36:40.850
I-- I-- is it
someone's boyfriend?

36:40.850 --> 36:41.851
O-- o-- or?

36:41.851 --> 36:43.026
Hey, what's going on?

36:43.026 --> 36:44.463
I don't know.
Stop asking me.

36:44.463 --> 36:46.769
I'm sorry, but they're
trying to fucking kill us.

36:46.769 --> 36:48.336
So that's why I'm asking.

36:48.336 --> 36:50.208
Screaming is not going
to keep us alive.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.513
Listen to me,
and maybe that will.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.298
Now get on your goddamn phone.

36:58.041 --> 36:59.869
I've got nothing,
no signal.

36:59.869 --> 37:00.870
It's not working.

37:00.870 --> 37:01.871
No signal.
-  Me neither.

37:01.871 --> 37:03.699
Shit, shit, shit.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.048
All right, we need
to get prepared

37:05.048 --> 37:07.529
for whatever those people
are going to do next.

37:07.529 --> 37:09.488
In fact, you guys, we gotta
start gathering weapons.

37:09.488 --> 37:10.532
-  What?
- All right?

37:10.532 --> 37:11.751
- Weapons?
-  Yes.

37:11.751 --> 37:14.232
Anything that can hurt
or kill someone.

37:15.929 --> 37:16.930
Just anything, okay?

37:16.930 --> 37:18.279
Knives in the kitchen.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.063
Scissors in the drawer
or the fireplace poker.

37:20.063 --> 37:21.456
This is a farm.

37:21.456 --> 37:24.416
You don't have a gun
or something like that?

37:24.416 --> 37:25.939
My mom hates 'em. We don't
keep them in the house.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.288
What the fuck.

37:28.594 --> 37:30.291
My dad has a bunch of
shit in the shed

37:30.291 --> 37:31.336
but it's out by the orchard.

37:31.336 --> 37:33.076
His guns are in there too.

37:33.076 --> 37:34.295
But I'd have to...

37:34.295 --> 37:35.557
I'd have to go get it.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.345
First things first.

37:40.345 --> 37:41.607
We get ready to fight in here.

37:44.827 --> 37:46.264
It's okay. It's okay.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.308
They're just trying to scare us.

37:47.308 --> 37:48.396
Yeah? It's working.

37:48.396 --> 37:50.920
I know, but...

37:50.920 --> 37:53.183
I think they're trying not to
draw attention to themselves,

37:53.183 --> 37:54.924
trying not to
alert the neighbors.

37:54.924 --> 37:57.057
That's why they're using bows
and arrows and not guns.

37:57.057 --> 37:58.928
It's got to be a mistake, right?

37:58.928 --> 38:01.757
I mean, why else would
they be doing this?

38:01.757 --> 38:02.715
I don't know.

38:03.977 --> 38:05.413
I honestly don't know.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.506
Shit.

38:11.506 --> 38:12.812
Let me check the cars.

38:30.699 --> 38:31.961
We can't just
sit around doing nothing.

38:31.961 --> 38:34.355
Who's out there?

38:34.355 --> 38:36.401
I need one of you to run
upstairs and warn Esther.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.098
She's at the back of the house.

38:38.098 --> 38:39.447
She's not going to know what's
happening before it's too late.

38:39.447 --> 38:40.709
And what are you
going to do?

38:40.709 --> 38:42.145
Someone out there is
slashing our tires

38:42.145 --> 38:44.147
so we don't leave.

38:44.147 --> 38:45.453
I'm going to try and stop 'em.

38:45.453 --> 38:46.628
What?

38:46.628 --> 38:47.455
How?

38:47.455 --> 38:48.935
How do you think?

38:48.935 --> 38:51.503
Divya, I need you to open
the back door for me, okay,

38:51.503 --> 38:52.808
and then close it behind me.

38:52.808 --> 38:54.375
Lock it.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.682
If I make it back, I'm gonna
knock twice, and then once.

38:56.682 --> 38:58.379
Don't open it unless
you hear that.

38:58.379 --> 39:00.163
Two knocks followed by one.

39:00.163 --> 39:01.295
Are you fucking
kidding me?

39:01.295 --> 39:02.644
No, I'm not.

39:02.644 --> 39:04.298
Let's go.

39:04.298 --> 39:06.431
But if you
don't come back,

39:06.431 --> 39:09.347
then what do we do?

39:09.347 --> 39:11.523
All of you
do anything to survive,

39:11.523 --> 39:13.002
and I mean anything.

39:13.002 --> 39:14.264
Tess, this is insane.

39:14.264 --> 39:15.396
I know.

39:17.006 --> 39:18.051
Let's go.

39:21.794 --> 39:23.578
All right, come on.

39:54.043 --> 39:55.349
Hey.

40:52.667 --> 40:54.147
What happened
out there?

40:54.147 --> 40:55.714
I got one of them.

40:55.714 --> 40:56.976
Dead.

40:56.976 --> 40:58.238
Mia's car is still okay.

40:58.238 --> 41:00.283
Look at your hands.

41:00.283 --> 41:01.371
It's fine.

41:01.371 --> 41:02.547
No, it's not.

41:02.547 --> 41:03.548
You're bleeding.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.375
No, it's not mine.

41:05.375 --> 41:07.029
We don't have time
to think about this.

41:07.029 --> 41:09.771
They're gonna come after us when
they find out what's happened.

41:09.771 --> 41:11.381
I didn't see anyone else
out there

41:11.381 --> 41:13.471
but, I know they're
wandering around

41:13.471 --> 41:15.124
trying to figure out
what to do next...

41:26.440 --> 41:27.963
Oh, these are great.

41:27.963 --> 41:29.356
Thank you, guys.

41:29.356 --> 41:30.488
Got it.

41:33.186 --> 41:35.623
Each of you, you need to
grab one thing from this pile.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.103
Be ready to use it.

41:38.931 --> 41:40.323
See if you recognize this guy.

41:40.323 --> 41:41.281
I don't.

41:43.283 --> 41:44.197
No.

41:46.025 --> 41:46.895
Take a look.

41:55.904 --> 41:57.602
Jackass.

41:58.733 --> 42:00.213
No?

42:00.213 --> 42:02.128
All right, I'm gonna go upstairs
to try to help Esther.

42:02.128 --> 42:04.043
Two of you, keep your eyes
on the kitchen.

42:07.394 --> 42:10.179
We're gonna get out of here but
we have to do this together.

42:10.179 --> 42:11.224
Okay?

42:11.224 --> 42:15.924
Tess, I'm scared.

42:15.924 --> 42:17.186
Me, too.

42:17.186 --> 42:18.797
I just...

42:18.797 --> 42:21.277
I just want to see
my little girl,

42:21.277 --> 42:23.192
and that's all I want, okay?

42:23.192 --> 42:24.846
To be with my family again.

42:24.846 --> 42:27.022
You will.

42:27.022 --> 42:29.372
And...

42:29.372 --> 42:31.200
Hey.

42:31.200 --> 42:34.203
I'm sorry that we're always
at each other's throats.

42:34.203 --> 42:37.903
I know it has a lot more to do
with me than it does with you.

42:37.903 --> 42:40.862
I appreciate
you saying that.

42:40.862 --> 42:42.734
Even if it isn't true.

42:44.779 --> 42:46.215
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

43:05.365 --> 43:06.279
Any luck?

43:07.323 --> 43:09.064
Oh, fuck.

43:09.064 --> 43:10.109
Esther!

43:14.635 --> 43:18.247
Come here. I need to--
oh, shit.

43:22.382 --> 43:23.296
Damn it.

43:38.224 --> 43:39.138
What happened up there?

43:42.794 --> 43:44.143
Esther, she was...

43:46.972 --> 43:47.929
What?

43:50.062 --> 43:52.760
She leaned out too far and...

43:52.760 --> 43:53.892
I couldn't--

43:57.722 --> 43:59.027
I'm sorry, Mia.

44:00.768 --> 44:03.031
I'm s... I'm so sorry.

44:08.733 --> 44:11.300
She was trying to
save us.

44:11.300 --> 44:12.780
Oh, my god.

44:12.780 --> 44:14.303
They're gonna come in here
and kill us.

44:14.303 --> 44:15.957
I know it.
- Stop it, okay?

44:15.957 --> 44:18.133
We're safe in here for now.
Stop saying that.

44:18.133 --> 44:19.613
That's not true.

44:19.613 --> 44:21.789
There are people out there.

44:21.789 --> 44:23.878
They killed three of us
already with arrows.

44:23.878 --> 44:25.488
So how can you say that?

44:25.488 --> 44:27.273
I'm saying it
because I believe it.

44:27.273 --> 44:30.668
I'm saying it to all of you
because I believe it.

44:30.668 --> 44:31.843
Yeah.

44:31.843 --> 44:34.367
Well, Esther believed you too.

44:34.367 --> 44:37.152
When you told her to go up there
and make a phone call?

44:37.152 --> 44:39.720
Maybe you should have done it
yourself if it was so dangerous.

44:39.720 --> 44:41.113
Divya.

44:41.113 --> 44:42.070
That is not fair.

44:42.070 --> 44:43.332
I don't care.

44:43.332 --> 44:45.030
I'm not being fair right now.

44:45.030 --> 44:46.727
I'm calling Tess out on her
decisions so far,

44:46.727 --> 44:47.772
that's what I'm doing.

44:47.772 --> 44:50.644
That's fine.
Yeah. Fuck it.

44:50.644 --> 44:51.993
I'm gonna sit right here

44:51.993 --> 44:53.168
and you're going to tell us
what to do, Divya,

44:53.168 --> 44:55.170
since you have
such a big fucking mouth.

44:55.170 --> 44:57.259
You're going to come up
with a plan for our survival.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.224
Evening, ladies.

45:50.617 --> 45:52.097
How's your party going?

45:55.361 --> 45:56.797
We've called the police.

45:56.797 --> 46:00.061
They're on their way
right now.

46:00.061 --> 46:03.891
Bullshit.
There's no signal out here.

46:03.891 --> 46:05.763
We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.722
And if you had called,

46:08.722 --> 46:10.071
your friend wouldn't
have been hanging out

46:10.071 --> 46:12.465
the window back there
trying to get a few bars.

46:14.467 --> 46:18.471
I tell you what;
let's get this shit over with...

46:23.868 --> 46:25.783
Because if you don't do that,

46:27.480 --> 46:28.698
try and do something smart,

46:28.698 --> 46:30.831
like, get away,

46:31.963 --> 46:33.834
I'm gonna set my guys
loose on you.

46:33.834 --> 46:35.662
And you're not gonna like that.

46:35.662 --> 46:37.838
Not one bit.
I promise you won't.

46:39.797 --> 46:40.885
And after all,

46:40.885 --> 46:44.236
that fucking and killing,

46:44.236 --> 46:47.892
we're still just gonna get
what we came for.

46:47.892 --> 46:49.807
So why don't you make it
easier on everybody

46:49.807 --> 46:51.243
and come outside?

46:53.506 --> 46:54.855
If you do that...

46:55.900 --> 46:58.032
right now,

46:58.032 --> 46:59.729
and this is the only chance

46:59.729 --> 47:01.340
I'm ever going to give you,

47:02.602 --> 47:04.996
I will let you go.

47:04.996 --> 47:07.389
You got my word on it.

47:07.389 --> 47:08.956
Open up that front door

47:08.956 --> 47:10.828
and walk right out.

47:10.828 --> 47:14.483
Leave your car.
Run down the road to safety.

47:14.483 --> 47:16.050
Right now.

47:19.880 --> 47:21.403
You got no idea who we are

47:21.403 --> 47:23.536
and all we want is
what's inside that house.

47:25.059 --> 47:26.234
What is it?
What's inside the house?

47:26.234 --> 47:27.845
What is he
talking about?

47:27.845 --> 47:28.976
What is it
they think is here.

47:28.976 --> 47:30.195
I have no idea.

47:30.195 --> 47:32.066
Please, Beth,
you got to tell us.

47:32.066 --> 47:34.112
That-- there's--
there's nothing here.

47:34.112 --> 47:36.897
- Please.
- She said she doesn't know.

47:36.897 --> 47:37.985
He is a liar.

47:37.985 --> 47:39.900
Tess, honestly.

47:39.900 --> 47:41.206
What's in here?

47:42.555 --> 47:43.512
Nothing I know off.

47:43.512 --> 47:44.862
Oh, come on.

47:44.862 --> 47:47.081
Even criminals don't
just attack for no reason.

47:47.081 --> 47:49.127
Yes, they do.
All the time.

47:49.127 --> 47:51.172
You know what I mean?

47:51.172 --> 47:54.045
He said he wants
what's inside the house.

47:54.045 --> 47:56.221
Why would they say
there's something here?

47:56.221 --> 47:57.831
Why would they
go through all this

47:57.831 --> 47:59.398
if there wasn't
anything to gain?

47:59.398 --> 48:01.313
To draw us out, to get--
get us out of the house?

48:01.313 --> 48:03.881
I don't know.
The only thing I know is

48:03.881 --> 48:05.795
there isn't anything
of value in here.

48:05.795 --> 48:07.319
He's tricking us.

48:08.494 --> 48:10.365
He sounds serious to me.

48:13.803 --> 48:16.371
What the fuck is
taking so long?

48:16.371 --> 48:19.200
I don't know
what's happening here?

48:19.200 --> 48:23.291
Why you think we have
anything of value?

48:23.291 --> 48:24.727
But we don't.

48:24.727 --> 48:27.034
This is our parent's place

48:27.034 --> 48:31.734
and they don't have
a safe or antiques

48:31.734 --> 48:33.954
or anything like that.

48:33.954 --> 48:36.217
And if somebody
told you they do,

48:36.217 --> 48:38.959
they were lying to you, okay?

48:38.959 --> 48:43.746
So please, please,
please just leave.

48:43.746 --> 48:45.357
Please leave!

48:48.969 --> 48:50.318
Not what we heard.

48:52.190 --> 48:55.454
Why don't you open up
that front door?

48:55.454 --> 48:57.412
Let us come inside
and take a look around.

48:57.412 --> 49:00.328
If that's true,
we'll walk away.

49:00.328 --> 49:02.243
And you all make it
through the night.

49:03.941 --> 49:05.159
It's up to you now.

49:06.856 --> 49:09.772
But this is my last offer...

49:09.772 --> 49:11.252
before bad things
start to happen.

49:11.252 --> 49:14.952
And I mean really bad
fucking things.

49:17.128 --> 49:19.565
I know who that is.
I know that voice.

49:19.565 --> 49:20.783
Who?

49:20.783 --> 49:22.785
The guy from the store today.

49:22.785 --> 49:26.224
I had words with him.

49:26.224 --> 49:28.313
He must have gotten
his friends and--

49:28.313 --> 49:31.359
and followed us or something.

49:31.359 --> 49:33.796
Yeah. The one who was
talking to us.

49:33.796 --> 49:35.015
Someone you just met, huh?

49:35.015 --> 49:36.321
What happened
at the store?

49:36.321 --> 49:37.539
What exactly did he say?

49:37.539 --> 49:38.627
What did you do to them?

49:38.627 --> 49:39.802
Nothing.
They were just being dicks

49:39.802 --> 49:40.978
and I got into it with them.

49:40.978 --> 49:43.589
Then tell them you're sorry.

49:43.589 --> 49:45.808
If it's true,
and that's why they're here,

49:45.808 --> 49:46.809
just tell them
you didn't mean it.

49:46.809 --> 49:48.463
No. No, it can't be.

49:48.463 --> 49:51.989
He said we could leave.
He said it.

49:51.989 --> 49:54.556
No. Everything he says
is a lie.

49:54.556 --> 49:57.081
- Tess.
-  Oh, my fucking God.

49:57.081 --> 49:58.996
Listen to this bitch.

49:58.996 --> 50:01.955
She's gonna get us killed.
I'm serious.

50:01.955 --> 50:03.478
Well, I'm not
gonna open this door

50:03.478 --> 50:05.480
and let them walk in and hope
that nothing bad happens.

50:05.480 --> 50:07.439
You really want to play
that game with these animals?

50:08.614 --> 50:10.137
He said he would kill us.

50:10.137 --> 50:13.010
I know
what he fucking said.

50:13.010 --> 50:16.665
Well, you are
the soldier person.

50:16.665 --> 50:18.537
So why don't you save us?

50:18.537 --> 50:21.105
I would if I could.

50:21.105 --> 50:23.150
Go on war hero.
Do something.

50:23.150 --> 50:26.153
Bridget, stop.
Don't be an idiot.

50:26.153 --> 50:29.026
What? Fuck both of you!

50:29.026 --> 50:31.941
Stop being an asshole,
Bridget!

50:31.941 --> 50:33.378
God.

50:35.771 --> 50:37.295
All right, ladies.

50:38.905 --> 50:40.211
Time's up.

50:42.082 --> 50:43.562
You've made your choice.

50:44.476 --> 50:47.087
I don't care how long it takes.

50:47.087 --> 50:49.524
We're gonna pick you off
one by one,

50:49.524 --> 50:51.570
and we're gonna
fucking enjoy it.

51:03.408 --> 51:04.409
Shit.

51:18.901 --> 51:21.252
Get to the middle.
Get in closer. Come on.

51:44.710 --> 51:46.407
Billy is dead.

51:46.407 --> 51:48.366
What?

51:48.366 --> 51:50.281
I thought we hadn't heard from
him for a while,

51:50.281 --> 51:53.936
and then Cody found him
over by their fucking cars...

51:53.936 --> 51:55.764
They stabbed him.

51:55.764 --> 51:56.809
Fuck.

51:56.809 --> 51:59.420
They stabbed him.

52:02.597 --> 52:06.035
Okay, okay.

52:06.035 --> 52:08.255
You know
who it was, right?

52:10.605 --> 52:12.520
It was that
fucking army bitch.

52:14.653 --> 52:18.178
Okay, that's how
she wants to play?

52:18.178 --> 52:20.180
that's how we'll play.

52:20.180 --> 52:22.661
Dude, are you sure
about this?

52:24.228 --> 52:26.273
Dead sure.

52:26.273 --> 52:27.840
They fucking
killed him, man.

52:28.971 --> 52:30.799
He's dead.

52:30.799 --> 52:32.671
All right? Dead.

52:32.671 --> 52:35.804
I know. I heard you.

52:35.804 --> 52:38.285
And now they're gonna
pay for it. I promise.

52:43.160 --> 52:45.205
Can't we
just bust in there...

52:45.205 --> 52:46.250
- No.
- And get the fuck-- ?

52:46.250 --> 52:47.773
Come on.
- No, no, no.

52:48.730 --> 52:51.603
At first
I just wanted to spook 'em.

52:51.603 --> 52:55.563
I just wanted to scare 'em
a little bit and make 'em sweat.

52:55.563 --> 52:58.175
Now I want to toy with them.

52:58.175 --> 53:00.481
Now I want to have
a little fun

53:00.481 --> 53:04.268
because that's what
they deserve.

53:04.268 --> 53:09.229
Okay. Okay.
It just seems...

53:09.229 --> 53:10.926
What?

53:10.926 --> 53:12.580
I planned this for six months.

53:12.580 --> 53:14.756
We already started,
and we're not stopping now.

53:14.756 --> 53:16.976
I'm not gonna let
some shitbags ruin it for us.

53:21.372 --> 53:24.984
It's just, it's getting
kinda a little bit more

53:24.984 --> 53:26.855
than we bargained for here.

53:26.855 --> 53:28.596
Listen to me.

53:28.596 --> 53:30.903
You heard what those guys
said, right?

53:30.903 --> 53:32.121
This place has been sold.

53:32.121 --> 53:34.036
They were packing up
and moving on.

53:34.036 --> 53:36.865
The time is now.
This is it.

53:36.865 --> 53:38.693
Guys like us are never
gonna have another shot

53:38.693 --> 53:40.173
at money like this.

53:40.173 --> 53:42.001
Not ever.

53:42.001 --> 53:43.176
And I want it.

53:43.176 --> 53:44.699
I want what they got in there.

53:44.699 --> 53:46.353
I want what they got
in the house,

53:46.353 --> 53:48.268
and I want to kill
that bitch as well.

53:48.268 --> 53:49.878
I'm gonna find her,

53:49.878 --> 53:50.966
and I'm gonna stick my knife

53:50.966 --> 53:52.620
right through her fucking skull.

54:03.152 --> 54:04.502
Shit.

54:12.292 --> 54:14.076
What the fuck
are they doing?

54:14.076 --> 54:16.731
Why are they just
sitting out there?

54:16.731 --> 54:20.996
Look, I'm sorry
about Rose, you know?

54:20.996 --> 54:23.042
I'm just...

54:23.042 --> 54:24.261
fucking scared.

54:25.697 --> 54:26.872
I understand.

54:28.569 --> 54:30.745
I have to be honest
with you, guys.

54:30.745 --> 54:33.531
If they get in here,
we don't really have a chance.

54:33.531 --> 54:35.097
So we have to do
something drastic

54:35.097 --> 54:36.490
and we need to do it now.

54:36.490 --> 54:38.449
We need to do something
that they don't expect.

54:38.449 --> 54:40.581
What if we all just took off
running across the fields

54:40.581 --> 54:42.148
in a bunch of
different directions?

54:42.148 --> 54:43.410
They have
weapons and trucks.

54:43.410 --> 54:45.847
Still. Three or
four of us could make it.

54:47.849 --> 54:49.808
Okay, how you guys
feeling about that?

54:49.808 --> 54:51.636
A mass run out the door,
see what happens?

54:53.159 --> 54:56.597
Guys, it's better than
getting killed in here or worse.

54:56.597 --> 54:58.469
Tortured, raped. You know?

54:59.818 --> 55:00.906
Guys, come on.

55:00.906 --> 55:02.777
I don't think
I'd make it 50 yards.

55:02.777 --> 55:04.431
Yeah, me neither.

55:04.431 --> 55:05.519
Look at my shoes.

55:05.519 --> 55:06.955
I'm gonna get far barefoot?

55:06.955 --> 55:09.088
- Same.
-  Fine.

55:09.088 --> 55:10.307
It was just an idea.

55:10.307 --> 55:11.786
It's not
a bad idea, Divya.

55:11.786 --> 55:13.266
It just won't work.

55:13.266 --> 55:16.095
But something like it might.
Something more strategic.

55:18.532 --> 55:20.317
We need to attack.

55:20.317 --> 55:21.753
We need to bring
the fight to them

55:21.753 --> 55:23.537
or at least be prepared to fight
if they get in here,

55:23.537 --> 55:25.800
and they will get in here;
it's only a matter of time.

55:25.800 --> 55:28.150
If a couple of us
take off running,

55:28.150 --> 55:29.369
we could have a chance.

55:29.369 --> 55:32.285
Then what?
Leave the rest of us behind?

55:32.285 --> 55:33.286
No, no.
Just like I did before,

55:33.286 --> 55:34.418
but to arm ourselves.

55:34.418 --> 55:36.071
I have to get to
the toolshed, Beth.

55:36.071 --> 55:38.683
Let's all go there,
then, and lock ourselves in.

55:38.683 --> 55:40.815
No, we wouldn't make it.
Not all of us.

55:40.815 --> 55:42.426
Fucking hell.

55:42.426 --> 55:43.775
I'm just being honest.

55:44.819 --> 55:46.908
We wouldn't all make it
but I could make it.

55:46.908 --> 55:49.389
I could get there,
grab some ammo and some rifles,

55:49.389 --> 55:51.870
get back here so that we
possibly have a chance.

55:53.219 --> 55:55.700
That's-- that's the good news.

55:57.092 --> 56:00.269
My other idea
is the caretaker's cottage,

56:00.269 --> 56:01.793
just down the hill.

56:01.793 --> 56:03.534
It still has
a working landline.

56:03.534 --> 56:05.362
But the problem
is the caretakers.

56:05.362 --> 56:06.580
We don't know
if they're in on this or--

56:06.580 --> 56:08.234
or if they'll be there.

56:08.234 --> 56:10.367
Or what?
I mean, we have no idea.

56:10.367 --> 56:13.761
But one of you
needs to race out there,

56:13.761 --> 56:16.677
draw some attention to yourself,
break in, call 911,

56:16.677 --> 56:18.853
and then take off
and never look back.

56:18.853 --> 56:22.857
You mean,
that person will get away?

56:22.857 --> 56:27.384
I mean, after they make
the call or whatever?

56:27.384 --> 56:29.690
Maybe.
Means a lot of "maybes."

56:29.690 --> 56:31.344
A lot of things have to happen
for them to get away.

56:31.344 --> 56:34.173
But there's a chance, yes.

56:34.173 --> 56:35.740
It's not a terrible plan.

56:36.871 --> 56:39.308
But I have to tell you,
I will be using you as bait.

56:39.308 --> 56:40.832
I want them to chase you.

56:43.574 --> 56:45.402
It's not a suicide mission exactly,

56:45.402 --> 56:47.404
but it's not great.

56:47.404 --> 56:48.840
Hey, get over here.

56:50.102 --> 56:51.538
Hey.

56:54.628 --> 56:57.109
If we're gonna do anything,
we need to do it now.

56:57.109 --> 56:59.067
Anyone?

56:59.067 --> 57:00.547
I'll do it.

57:00.547 --> 57:04.246
What? Mia, no.
That is insane.

57:04.246 --> 57:06.118
Anybody else
run track in school?

57:10.949 --> 57:15.127
I didn't think so. But I did.
I ran track and I was fast.

57:15.127 --> 57:18.260
I was really fast. So...

57:18.260 --> 57:20.480
it makes sense
that it's me.

57:20.480 --> 57:24.005
And if I make it,
then I will see you ladies

57:24.005 --> 57:28.445
at Denny's tomorrow morning
for breakfast.

57:28.445 --> 57:31.883
And if I don't, then...

57:38.237 --> 57:39.934
You can have my car keys,

57:39.934 --> 57:41.675
if you can use them.

57:43.808 --> 57:45.287
Does anybody have a hair tie?

57:45.287 --> 57:46.941
Yeah, I do.

57:46.941 --> 57:48.465
You need to go
out the kitchen door.

57:48.465 --> 57:50.467
Okay? Make some noise.
I want them to see you.

57:50.467 --> 57:52.164
- Okay.
-  Run as fast as you can.

57:52.164 --> 57:54.122
Get to the house, call 911.

57:54.122 --> 57:55.297
I'll do the rest.

57:55.297 --> 57:57.212
Okay. Um...

57:59.824 --> 58:03.567
Um... Beth, can you hand me
those sneakers?

58:03.567 --> 58:05.786
I don't think he's going to
use them anymore.

58:05.786 --> 58:08.267
Ten seconds after
she runs out of that door,

58:08.267 --> 58:09.877
I will follow her.

58:09.877 --> 58:11.792
God, you really were
in the army, weren't you?

58:11.792 --> 58:13.881
I was. For a long time.

58:13.881 --> 58:15.622
Remember, it's two knocks
and then one.

58:15.622 --> 58:17.842
If anything else
they get in here,

58:17.842 --> 58:20.018
you run,
you fight to the death,

58:20.018 --> 58:22.020
whatever you have to do
to stay alive.

58:22.020 --> 58:25.502
I will find a way back inside
to get you.

58:25.502 --> 58:27.460
Okay?

58:27.460 --> 58:28.853
Okay.

58:34.946 --> 58:37.122
I'll see you bitches
at brunch tomorrow.

58:41.300 --> 58:42.519
Let's do this.

58:46.566 --> 58:47.785
Come on. Let's go.

58:59.144 --> 59:01.407
Thank you.
You're really fucking cool.

59:01.407 --> 59:05.237
Thanks.
Hey, um, full disclosure.

59:05.237 --> 59:09.458
I always wanted to ask you out.
I never had the guts to do it.

59:09.458 --> 59:11.417
Just so you know.

59:11.417 --> 59:13.941
Yeah, big crush,
all this time.

59:13.941 --> 59:16.378
Okay.

59:16.378 --> 59:17.771
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:00:15.481 --> 01:00:17.962
Hey! Assholes!

01:00:19.137 --> 01:00:20.747
Go fuck yourselves.

01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:29.713
You got this.

01:00:56.478 --> 01:00:59.307
Where's it?
Where is the phone?

01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:03.747
Where's the fucking phone.

01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:13.539
Come on. Come on.

01:01:13.539 --> 01:01:16.194
- No! No, what?

01:01:25.899 --> 01:01:29.773
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:01:29.773 --> 01:01:31.992
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:02:22.608 --> 01:02:23.783
Was that it?

01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:26.786
Is that...?

01:02:26.786 --> 01:02:28.701
Is that Tess?

01:02:28.701 --> 01:02:29.789
It can't be.

01:02:32.183 --> 01:02:33.750
- That's Tess.
- She said she would come in

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.577
through the back door.
- No.

01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:37.101
It's the front door.

01:02:37.101 --> 01:02:38.145
Why does
she need to get in?

01:02:38.145 --> 01:02:39.364
Why does she need to get in?

01:02:39.364 --> 01:02:41.453
She said, two, then one.
- It was two and one.

01:02:41.453 --> 01:02:43.063
That was two and one, right?

01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:44.586
We can't leave her out there.
-  Divya, just wait.

01:02:44.586 --> 01:02:45.718
We cannot leave her out there.

01:02:45.718 --> 01:02:46.675
Come on.
-  Divya, just wait.

01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:47.807
Just wait. Divya.

01:02:47.807 --> 01:02:49.113
But what if it's her?

01:02:49.113 --> 01:02:50.244
What if it's her?
-  Tess?

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:54.727
Tess, is that you?

01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:57.295
Seriously, is that you, or?

01:03:10.743 --> 01:03:11.744
Oh, god! Oh, god!

01:03:25.105 --> 01:03:28.456
Spread out. Find them.

01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:30.458
They're here somewhere.

01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:31.851
So find them.

01:05:18.088 --> 01:05:20.655
No, no!
Help me! Help me!

01:05:20.655 --> 01:05:22.266
Aaaahh!

01:05:33.712 --> 01:05:34.931
Oh, shit.

01:06:01.348 --> 01:06:02.523
Shit.

01:06:03.568 --> 01:06:05.744
Tell me
what the fuck is going on!

01:06:05.744 --> 01:06:07.746
I can't. I can't.

01:06:07.746 --> 01:06:08.965
Talk to me!

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.923
Can you untie me, please?

01:06:10.923 --> 01:06:12.272
Please untie me so--

01:06:12.272 --> 01:06:13.665
Why are they after us?

01:06:15.145 --> 01:06:16.973
Why?
- I-- I don't know.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:18.452
Bullshit.

01:06:18.452 --> 01:06:19.453
Tell me. Now!

01:06:19.453 --> 01:06:23.109
Okay. Okay.
Because we... we--

01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:24.241
we told 'em about...

01:06:24.241 --> 01:06:26.156
What? You told them what?

01:06:26.156 --> 01:06:28.332
About the money! The money.

01:06:28.332 --> 01:06:30.073
What are you talking about?

01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:31.988
Please untie me so I...

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.337
You'll tell me
what the fuck is going on

01:06:33.337 --> 01:06:34.773
or I'm gonna leave you here
to die.

01:06:34.773 --> 01:06:36.340
Okay, okay.

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:40.126
Okay, okay.

01:06:40.126 --> 01:06:42.259
These local guys,

01:06:42.259 --> 01:06:45.088
we used to push products sometimes.

01:06:45.088 --> 01:06:47.003
They-- they found out
about the cash

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.526
that we've been
storing in the house

01:06:48.526 --> 01:06:49.831
and they broke in here

01:06:49.831 --> 01:06:51.181
and they said
they were gonna kill us,

01:06:51.181 --> 01:06:54.010
so... we told them
about you guys at the house.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:56.751
We-- we told them
that you're with us.

01:06:57.883 --> 01:06:59.537
That you were our girlfriends.

01:07:00.973 --> 01:07:02.409
What?

01:07:02.409 --> 01:07:04.672
We were just trying
to stay alive, that's all.

01:07:04.672 --> 01:07:06.761
I-- I swear.

01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:07.719
Oh, shit.

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.380
I'm gonna cut you out.

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.034
and you're gonna help me,
do you understand?

01:07:19.122 --> 01:07:22.690
Yeah, okay.

01:07:32.396 --> 01:07:34.050
Where are my father's guns?

01:07:37.009 --> 01:07:38.097
Where are the guns?

01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:39.620
Fuck this.

01:07:53.156 --> 01:07:54.766
You fucking killed Billy.

01:07:57.421 --> 01:07:59.901
You should have run
when you coulda.

01:07:59.901 --> 01:08:00.815
I don't do that.

01:08:06.517 --> 01:08:08.171
The fuck?

01:08:35.285 --> 01:08:37.504
Well, well, well,
look what we got here.

01:08:38.984 --> 01:08:40.464
Little girl gang.

01:08:45.991 --> 01:08:48.645
Potato peeler? really?

01:08:50.822 --> 01:08:52.867
Look at these little bitches.

01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:54.304
Scared shitless.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.395
Where is she?

01:09:00.484 --> 01:09:02.312
You know who I'm talking about.

01:09:05.053 --> 01:09:06.925
You remember me?

01:09:06.925 --> 01:09:08.404
Any of you?

01:09:08.404 --> 01:09:11.189
Y'all too busy buying
Haagen-Daz and shit today?

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:14.149
I've...
I've never seen you before.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:17.153
No? You didn't
stop in town

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:18.631
at the little store
they got there?

01:09:18.631 --> 01:09:21.200
No. We just...

01:09:22.245 --> 01:09:23.680
we came straight here.

01:09:24.812 --> 01:09:26.292
For the party.

01:09:26.292 --> 01:09:28.425
Right, right.

01:09:28.425 --> 01:09:31.122
Well, too bad for you then.

01:09:31.122 --> 01:09:32.341
I remember you.

01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:34.560
Good.

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:39.305
I've shown you my face.

01:09:40.654 --> 01:09:42.265
You understand
what that means?

01:09:44.571 --> 01:09:47.139
It means none of you
are leaving here alive.

01:09:48.488 --> 01:09:50.707
Unless
we come to a deal.

01:09:50.707 --> 01:09:53.145
You got that? Right now.

01:09:53.145 --> 01:09:54.712
We come to an agreement,

01:09:54.712 --> 01:09:57.671
and you stick to it
and so will I.

01:09:57.671 --> 01:09:59.195
What do you want?

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:03.286
Hm. That's funny.

01:10:03.286 --> 01:10:05.375
You must be the funny one.
I like that.

01:10:06.767 --> 01:10:08.291
Can you believe these chicks
are drug dealers?

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:10.554
I mean,
it's a bit of a stretch, but.

01:10:10.554 --> 01:10:13.209
What? Drug dealers?

01:10:14.688 --> 01:10:17.343
What are you talking about?
That is so...

01:10:18.736 --> 01:10:21.086
We came here
for a bachelorette party

01:10:21.086 --> 01:10:25.395
and you attacked us.
Please just...

01:10:25.395 --> 01:10:26.787
And I'm sure you know
nothing about the cash

01:10:26.787 --> 01:10:28.311
they got up in the attic
either, huh?

01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:31.792
There's no cash.
There's no cash.

01:10:31.792 --> 01:10:33.272
Where's the army cunt?

01:10:36.319 --> 01:10:37.842
Where is she?

01:10:37.842 --> 01:10:40.888
I will fucking kill you
right now if you don't tell me.

01:10:40.888 --> 01:10:42.325
She's outside.

01:10:44.196 --> 01:10:46.546
She ran out to try
and make a call or--

01:10:46.546 --> 01:10:49.070
or help or get guns
or something,

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:51.116
anything she could do
to help us.

01:10:51.116 --> 01:10:52.335
I-- I am telling the truth.

01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:54.554
She's outside, I-- I promise.

01:10:54.554 --> 01:10:56.861
Hear from Cody
about the other one?

01:10:56.861 --> 01:10:58.079
Uh-uh.

01:10:58.079 --> 01:10:59.429
How about Dick?

01:11:01.126 --> 01:11:02.475
Mm-mm.

01:11:02.475 --> 01:11:04.825
Look, maybe
there is money here

01:11:04.825 --> 01:11:06.827
or whatever, okay?

01:11:06.827 --> 01:11:10.266
But we don't know
anything about that.

01:11:11.354 --> 01:11:13.007
We are just guests.

01:11:14.444 --> 01:11:17.316
Maybe Tess is mixed up
in all of this.

01:11:17.316 --> 01:11:18.622
I don't know. I mean,
I wouldn't put it past her.

01:11:18.622 --> 01:11:19.710
She's been really fucked up

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:21.146
since she came back
from the war.

01:11:21.146 --> 01:11:23.975
But that is not us.

01:11:23.975 --> 01:11:25.759
That has nothing
to do with us.

01:11:25.759 --> 01:11:28.240
Shh. Bridget, stop it.
Stop talk--

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.590
stop telling them shit.

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:33.941
You really gonna listen to
Black chick tell you what to do?

01:11:33.941 --> 01:11:36.335
Come on. Be your own woman.

01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:44.517
All right,
You done helpin' me out?

01:11:53.134 --> 01:11:55.963
- I guess she is.
- Mother fucker!

01:11:58.444 --> 01:11:59.967
Oh, shut the fuck up.

01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:05.059
You two, asses on the couch
if you want to live.

01:12:06.278 --> 01:12:07.497
Right now.

01:12:09.455 --> 01:12:11.457
I'm going to the attic
to check it out.

01:12:11.457 --> 01:12:12.632
If I find the cash,
I'll let you know.

01:12:12.632 --> 01:12:14.199
We'll start hauling it down.

01:12:14.199 --> 01:12:15.635
Hey. You think
maybe we should

01:12:15.635 --> 01:12:17.594
get the fuck out of here?

01:12:17.594 --> 01:12:19.335
We already got all the stuff
from the shed,

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:20.640
ain't that enough?

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.861
It's a lot of meth.
I'm just sayin'.

01:12:23.861 --> 01:12:26.342
If it was,
we'd be gone already.

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:27.560
You understand that?

01:12:29.257 --> 01:12:30.911
This is money.

01:12:30.911 --> 01:12:32.696
Cash money I want it all.

01:12:32.696 --> 01:12:34.262
I want the money,
I want the girl,

01:12:34.262 --> 01:12:35.960
so shut your mouth
and do what I say.

01:12:44.142 --> 01:12:45.796
That chick's coming back here,

01:12:45.796 --> 01:12:47.188
and when she does
we need to be ready.

01:12:47.188 --> 01:12:48.755
So you find her,
you bring her to me.

01:12:50.322 --> 01:12:51.715
Till then watch them.

01:12:53.456 --> 01:12:56.154
Kill them if they
so much as sneeze.

01:12:56.154 --> 01:12:57.416
Can we fuck 'em?

01:12:59.505 --> 01:13:01.289
When we're done, yeah.

01:13:02.508 --> 01:13:04.423
Not until we get
what we came for.

01:13:04.423 --> 01:13:05.642
Got it?

01:13:05.642 --> 01:13:06.730
Got it.

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:09.183
When it's time,
which one you want?

01:14:12.099 --> 01:14:13.187
I don't care.

01:14:14.972 --> 01:14:16.016
Either one.

01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:21.892
The black one, I guess.

01:14:21.892 --> 01:14:23.807
Oh, look at you.

01:14:23.807 --> 01:14:26.113
Fucking dark horse
is what you are.

01:14:26.113 --> 01:14:27.506
Hey.

01:14:27.506 --> 01:14:28.507
You want to fuck me?

01:14:28.507 --> 01:14:30.117
What are you doing?

01:14:30.117 --> 01:14:32.468
Stop.
- Go ahead and do it.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:34.470
I won't scream or anything...

01:14:35.601 --> 01:14:37.385
if you let us go after.

01:14:37.385 --> 01:14:39.431
- Shut up.
-  No.

01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:41.128
Let her talk.

01:14:41.128 --> 01:14:42.478
You'd do what?

01:14:43.435 --> 01:14:44.392
Say it again.

01:14:44.392 --> 01:14:45.698
Fuck you...

01:14:48.658 --> 01:14:50.137
or suck your cock.

01:14:51.356 --> 01:14:54.011
Oh, you little
piece of shit.

01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:55.142
You would, wouldn't you?

01:14:55.142 --> 01:14:58.319
Of course I would.
I want to live.

01:14:58.319 --> 01:15:00.321
So...

01:15:00.321 --> 01:15:03.107
please...

01:15:03.107 --> 01:15:04.238
let me do that.

01:15:09.069 --> 01:15:10.201
He said to wait.

01:15:11.898 --> 01:15:14.118
Fuck it.

01:15:14.118 --> 01:15:16.207
I'm not gonna stop her
if she wants to put my dick

01:15:16.207 --> 01:15:17.730
in her mouth so badly.

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:21.125
You go ahead.

01:15:21.125 --> 01:15:22.561
Okay.

01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:24.041
Then you let us go.

01:15:26.652 --> 01:15:28.219
Let's see how you do first.

01:15:51.895 --> 01:15:53.113
Agh!

01:16:12.611 --> 01:16:13.612
How many more?

01:16:13.612 --> 01:16:15.614
Just one. Upstairs.

01:16:15.614 --> 01:16:17.181
- Gun?
- I didn't see any.

01:16:19.444 --> 01:16:20.880
You do what you want
to that one

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.621
and then you run
and don't look back.

01:16:22.621 --> 01:16:24.623
We'll take care of this one.
Don't you worry.

01:16:40.683 --> 01:16:41.901
Oh, come on.

01:16:43.729 --> 01:16:45.905
Oh, I want it all.

01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:50.649
Oh, come on.

01:16:50.649 --> 01:16:52.085
No rush.

01:16:53.347 --> 01:16:54.740
You're the last one left.

01:16:58.004 --> 01:16:59.310
Wow.

01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:01.312
That is a lot of money.

01:17:01.312 --> 01:17:02.618
Yeah.

01:17:04.141 --> 01:17:06.056
You're one tough little shit,
aren't you?

01:17:09.494 --> 01:17:10.713
I am.

01:17:13.759 --> 01:17:15.848
Which one
was your boyfriend?

01:17:15.848 --> 01:17:18.111
Not that it matters,
they're both dead,

01:17:18.111 --> 01:17:20.026
but still...

01:17:20.026 --> 01:17:22.681
you were really fucking
slumming it, weren't you?

01:17:22.681 --> 01:17:25.902
Must make you
a nasty little junkie.

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.035
You still don't get it.

01:17:31.734 --> 01:17:33.170
It was just a party.

01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:38.131
Oh, fuck.

01:17:40.525 --> 01:17:42.919
My bad.

01:17:42.919 --> 01:17:45.269
Just wrong place, wrong time
for you girls, huh?

01:17:46.618 --> 01:17:47.924
I guess so.

01:17:56.933 --> 01:17:58.978
Just turn around
and walk away.

01:17:58.978 --> 01:18:01.633
You do that right now,
and I won't follow you.

01:18:01.633 --> 01:18:04.157
I promise.

01:18:04.157 --> 01:18:05.419
I can't do that.

01:18:06.551 --> 01:18:08.248
I'm gonna kill you.

01:18:08.248 --> 01:18:10.903
Holy shit.

01:18:10.903 --> 01:18:13.732
I'm giving you an out now,
so take it.

01:18:13.732 --> 01:18:16.343
- I don't want it.
- Motherfucker.

01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:18.998
We don't need to do
this shit anymore, all right?

01:18:18.998 --> 01:18:20.870
So let's come to
an understanding or something.

01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:27.224
Wow.

01:18:28.399 --> 01:18:30.183
Silent treatment, huh?

01:18:32.795 --> 01:18:35.232
Why do women gotta be
so fucking difficult?

01:18:39.062 --> 01:18:40.367
Let's go.

01:19:13.618 --> 01:19:15.446
You fucked
with the wrong girls.

01:20:29.259 --> 01:20:30.347
Oh, fuck it.

01:21:35.368 --> 01:21:36.935
So...

01:21:38.154 --> 01:21:40.069
why don't you tell us again...

01:21:40.983 --> 01:21:42.549
what happened?

01:21:42.549 --> 01:21:44.595
Real slow,

01:21:44.595 --> 01:21:46.249
so we can all follow along.

01:21:48.816 --> 01:21:50.557
I'm sorry,
that sounds like an order.

01:21:50.557 --> 01:21:53.038
I thought this was an interview
that I granted you.

01:21:56.476 --> 01:21:58.087
Please.

01:22:00.611 --> 01:22:03.962
Okay. Which part?

01:22:03.962 --> 01:22:06.051
The attack part.

01:22:06.051 --> 01:22:08.924
The attack on all you girls
at your daddy's house.

01:22:10.142 --> 01:22:11.752
It's my parents' house.

01:22:11.752 --> 01:22:14.103
My father and my mother
own it.

01:22:14.103 --> 01:22:16.453
Mind if we record this?

01:22:16.453 --> 01:22:19.151
I didn't think it was
that kind of a meeting, Frank.

01:22:19.151 --> 01:22:21.719
It's not Bev.
Just asking.

01:22:21.719 --> 01:22:23.460
Then I'd prefer you didn't.

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:24.504
Fine.

01:22:24.504 --> 01:22:26.071
Now, you said before

01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:27.986
that you tried to keep
these men out of the house

01:22:27.986 --> 01:22:32.425
by blocking the windows
and locking all the doors,

01:22:32.425 --> 01:22:33.818
that kind of thing?

01:22:33.818 --> 01:22:35.298
Yes.

01:22:37.126 --> 01:22:40.085
But that at some point
they overpowered you,

01:22:40.085 --> 01:22:43.306
and they took you all hostage
inside the main property.

01:22:43.306 --> 01:22:44.524
Inside.

01:22:48.528 --> 01:22:50.008
Correct.

01:22:50.008 --> 01:22:51.792
I believe
she already covered that

01:22:51.792 --> 01:22:53.620
in her initial statement.

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:54.621
Well, that's good.

01:22:54.621 --> 01:22:55.971
That's good, because now

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:58.190
she won't have any trouble
reviewing it again

01:22:58.190 --> 01:23:00.279
a second time, will you?

01:23:01.933 --> 01:23:03.239
No, I don't.

01:23:03.239 --> 01:23:06.155
But I do have a problem
with your tone, Sheriff.

01:23:06.155 --> 01:23:08.418
I'm not the guilty party here.

01:23:08.418 --> 01:23:09.941
None of us are.

01:23:09.941 --> 01:23:11.203
We are the victims.

01:23:11.203 --> 01:23:13.684
And if nothing else,
we'd like your sympathy.

01:23:15.207 --> 01:23:19.298
You're telling me
that these guys came in there,

01:23:19.298 --> 01:23:24.129
took over, killed a whole bunch
of you ladies,

01:23:24.129 --> 01:23:25.913
and then once they got
what they wanted,

01:23:25.913 --> 01:23:27.132
turned on each other

01:23:27.132 --> 01:23:29.656
and started killing
themselves instead.

01:23:29.656 --> 01:23:31.006
Meanwhile, outside,

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:33.008
up at that tool shed
you got on the property,

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:35.140
out on the lawn,
up in the attic,

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:38.622
a fucking bloodbath.

01:23:38.622 --> 01:23:43.670
And then, at some point,
at some point, the three of you

01:23:43.670 --> 01:23:46.021
overpowered two of these boys,

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:48.632
and then you killed them
in self-defense

01:23:48.632 --> 01:23:51.939
with fucking potato peelers
and garden shears

01:23:51.939 --> 01:23:53.724
and shit like that.

01:23:53.724 --> 01:23:55.247
And then,

01:23:55.247 --> 01:23:58.120
you escaped on foot,

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.252
undetected by anyone,

01:24:00.252 --> 01:24:03.995
and made it all the way
back into town.

01:24:03.995 --> 01:24:05.649
Is that what I'm
supposed to believe?

01:24:07.607 --> 01:24:08.739
That's right.

01:24:10.915 --> 01:24:14.962
Well, I don't.
I just do not.

01:24:14.962 --> 01:24:17.008
Well, I'm sorry.
That is what happened.

01:24:17.008 --> 01:24:19.271
Horseshit, young lady. Horseshit.

01:24:19.271 --> 01:24:21.882
I'm sorry,
is that a question?

01:24:21.882 --> 01:24:24.798
You know exactly
what that is.

01:24:24.798 --> 01:24:26.365
I see.

01:24:26.365 --> 01:24:29.586
Is there anything further
you need from her at this point?

01:24:37.202 --> 01:24:39.335
No, I guess not.

01:24:39.335 --> 01:24:41.989
I mean, I got a shitload
of questions.

01:24:41.989 --> 01:24:44.601
But I think I'll save 'em
for another time

01:24:44.601 --> 01:24:46.385
and all those lawsuits

01:24:46.385 --> 01:24:48.953
I know will start
coming down your way.

01:24:48.953 --> 01:24:50.433
I will tell you this though...

01:24:54.132 --> 01:24:56.047
I hope I never see you
or any of those girls

01:24:56.047 --> 01:24:58.180
up in these parts,
not ever again.

01:24:59.485 --> 01:25:01.270
You understand
what I'm saying?

01:25:02.793 --> 01:25:04.925
Yes, that's very clear.

01:25:04.925 --> 01:25:06.144
And just to be more clear,

01:25:06.144 --> 01:25:08.233
you're telling me
that you and your sisters

01:25:08.233 --> 01:25:10.540
had no idea
what was going on out there

01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:14.413
with those caretakers
and their meth lab and all that.

01:25:14.413 --> 01:25:16.372
That you just happened
to come up there that night

01:25:16.372 --> 01:25:20.506
for your little party,
and all this shit came down

01:25:20.506 --> 01:25:25.163
by some very strange
and almost impossible

01:25:25.163 --> 01:25:27.252
goddamn coincidence?

01:25:30.212 --> 01:25:32.214
Yeah...

01:25:32.214 --> 01:25:34.651
Just wrong place,
wrong time, I guess.

01:26:05.986 --> 01:26:06.900
What'd they ask you about--?

01:27:05.045 --> 01:27:05.959
You okay?

01:27:07.178 --> 01:27:09.572
No, but I will be.

01:27:10.747 --> 01:27:11.791
Let's go.
