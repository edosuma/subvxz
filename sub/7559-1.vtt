WEBVTT

00:09.208 --> 00:11.674
Ready? On? I think it is.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.683
Is it running?

00:13.783 --> 00:17.210
Yeah, go. Wait, no, hang on,
I'm not. Action!

00:18.999 --> 00:20.986
So where should we start, you think?

00:21.496 --> 00:27.187
Just introduce yourself
and tell me about your company.

00:27.287 --> 00:28.947
You wanna do a push up or something?

00:29.047 --> 00:30.106
- No.
- Okay.

00:31.575 --> 00:32.928
Okay.

00:36.344 --> 00:39.251
Hi, I'm Beatle Boy... That's stupid, okay?

00:39.351 --> 00:40.848
It's not, it's cool. Do it again.

00:41.079 --> 00:44.244
Hi, there, I'm Beetle Boyin,
and I'm gonna be your guide

00:44.344 --> 00:47.672
on the fascinating journey through
the world of cold-blooded killing.

00:49.528 --> 00:51.262
Tell me about yourself, Beetle.

00:52.503 --> 00:56.691
Uh... ever want to kill somebody?
I know I do.

00:56.791 --> 00:58.067
Whoa, sorry.

00:58.167 --> 01:01.075
Not a Hitman, you say.
Well, that's not a problem.

01:01.175 --> 01:06.816
Just follow the instructions in my easy
to follow video, and you too...

01:09.400 --> 01:10.483
Nah, that sounds weird.

01:10.583 --> 01:13.396
- How many times do we have to do this?
- What do you think? We got everything?

01:13.496 --> 01:15.612
'Till I want to buy the video.

01:18.007 --> 01:19.700
Hi, there, my name is Beetle Boyin,

01:19.800 --> 01:21.620
and I'm here with
the first ever of its kind,

01:21.720 --> 01:23.571
instructional video for Hitmen.

01:23.671 --> 01:26.236
Ever want to kill someone? I know I do.

01:26.872 --> 01:30.324
It's easy, just follow the instructions
in my video, and you, too,

01:30.424 --> 01:31.712
can be a Hitman.

01:33.656 --> 01:35.096
That was really good.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.611
This is some really, really
great stuff here, Beatle.

01:42.711 --> 01:45.722
I mean it's just down right
entertaining all the way around.

01:47.319 --> 01:49.273
You know what I like about it
the most though?

01:49.912 --> 01:52.639
That even though the footage
is several years old.

01:53.175 --> 01:55.740
There is no statue
of limitations on murder.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.480
You know what that is?

02:01.527 --> 02:04.539
Let me jog your memory. Dead body.

02:05.015 --> 02:07.263
In your loft about seven years ago.

02:08.439 --> 02:09.912
No? Nothing?

02:11.767 --> 02:15.188
Well, based on the evidence at the time,
we couldn't charge you with a crime.

02:15.288 --> 02:16.925
But that's all changed now, hasn't it?

02:18.616 --> 02:20.285
Still not ringing a bell, huh?

02:21.240 --> 02:22.547
Okay.

02:22.647 --> 02:24.317
Maybe this will help.

02:29.495 --> 02:32.376
Why don't you tell me about
your relationship with Athena Glendon?

02:38.199 --> 02:40.275
How about Carla Garret?

02:40.375 --> 02:42.295
You care to explain that one to me?

02:45.527 --> 02:49.794
So you don't wanna talk about Athena,
you don't wanna talk about Carla?

02:51.416 --> 02:54.493
Well, maybe we should
talk about Kyle Sullivan? Hm?

02:55.127 --> 02:58.520
How bout we talk about the time
when you knocked him unconscious?

02:59.960 --> 03:02.515
Did your connection to Kyle
kinda slip your mind

03:02.615 --> 03:04.495
when you were giving
your statement to the police?

03:08.247 --> 03:10.739
Look we got him now, okay?

03:10.839 --> 03:13.785
And I gotta do everything I can
to keep this guy locked up.

03:15.512 --> 03:16.952
So here's the deal.

03:18.327 --> 03:20.062
You tell me everything you know.

03:20.695 --> 03:24.001
And I'll do what I can in getting this
first degree murder charge reduced.

03:25.143 --> 03:28.756
- Can I ask you a question, Randy?
- It's Detective Hult.

03:28.856 --> 03:32.216
Hmm. Do you see handcuffs on my wrists?

03:33.335 --> 03:34.356
No.

03:34.456 --> 03:39.901
Okay, then. I think we can both agree
that I am not under arrest. Correct?

03:41.240 --> 03:45.428
And I think we both know that's because
you can't charge me with anything.

03:45.528 --> 03:46.547
Unless you can prove it.

03:46.647 --> 03:49.211
Oh, I intend to, believe me, I do.

03:50.295 --> 03:53.907
You see when we brought Kyle Sullivan
down and we went through his stuff.

03:54.007 --> 03:55.443
I think you're gonna be surprised to know

03:55.543 --> 03:58.260
that he had an awful lot of
information lying around.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.788
But what I think you're gonna be
more surprised about Beatle?

04:00.888 --> 04:05.656
Is that some of that evidence tells
a very compelling story about you.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.305
I like to call it,
The Adventures of Beatle.

04:11.287 --> 04:15.575
And it all begins April the 27th, 2006.

04:16.504 --> 04:18.522
The day you met Athena Glendon.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:10.872 --> 07:14.004
Uh, wait, uh.
It's four o'clock in the morning,

07:14.104 --> 07:18.271
don't you think that you should,
um, stay and just get some rest?

07:19.351 --> 07:21.948
Gotta run. See you next week.

07:34.487 --> 07:37.149
Shut... Shut up!

07:47.703 --> 07:50.675
The red hot action
starts tonight, at eight,

07:50.775 --> 07:52.924
followed by an all new episode of...

07:53.495 --> 07:55.955
Isn't that the truth Phil?

07:56.055 --> 08:00.051
- Well, folks, it's Thursday April 27th.
- Thursday. Shit!

08:00.151 --> 08:01.657
We have a foggy start this morning.

08:12.727 --> 08:17.146
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Shit. Shit!

08:18.103 --> 08:19.674
Have a nice trip, buddy.

08:51.159 --> 08:55.808
Okay, so, what's the total
for all the parking tickets?

08:59.095 --> 09:00.033
What?

09:00.535 --> 09:03.379
No. No, I'm still here.

09:03.479 --> 09:05.427
Are you sure that's right? I mean...

09:05.527 --> 09:09.107
I know it's eight tickets
but you could feed a family of four

09:09.207 --> 09:11.411
for three fucking months
with that kind of money.

09:11.511 --> 09:12.864
No, I'm not.

09:14.103 --> 09:18.010
Don't get snippy with me. Ma'am.

09:18.455 --> 09:20.851
According to Athena's
bank statements at the time.

09:20.951 --> 09:25.683
She had approximately
negative $27.38 to her name.

09:25.783 --> 09:29.340
But Athena didn't get the money
from you did she? She got it from Kyle.

09:30.295 --> 09:32.314
You know the guy
that you beat the shit out of?

09:34.039 --> 09:36.222
I really don't get where you're
going with this, Randy.

09:36.791 --> 09:38.866
It's Detective Hult.

09:38.966 --> 09:41.564
And where I'm going is Kyle Sullivan.

09:44.661 --> 09:46.617
So it's come to this has it?

09:47.447 --> 09:50.259
- You know I'll pay you back.
- I know you will, I know you will.

09:50.359 --> 09:51.283
You realize, of course,

09:51.383 --> 09:53.651
you're going to have to pay it
back in more ways than one.

09:53.751 --> 09:55.411
You know my situation, Kyle.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.395
Yeah, well, I know if you were still
managing the store for me

09:57.495 --> 09:58.803
you wouldn't need to be
borrowing any money.

09:58.903 --> 10:00.051
Yeah, and from what I understand,

10:00.151 --> 10:02.611
they give you free room and board
in prison, so you're probably right.

10:02.711 --> 10:05.235
Meanwhile,
I have a regular legal job as a career

10:05.335 --> 10:07.763
and my car is sort
of an integral part of that.

10:07.863 --> 10:09.555
- Ah.
- You gonna help me, or not?

10:09.655 --> 10:10.943
Why should I?

10:12.214 --> 10:13.426
I don't know.

10:13.526 --> 10:16.883
Kyle, why don't you think of it
as workman's comp

10:16.983 --> 10:19.731
for this krink in my neck
I'm getting from looking the other way.

10:19.831 --> 10:23.795
Well, you know, Athena, I'd be happy
to rub that out for you myself.

10:23.895 --> 10:26.557
- Stop.
- Oh, just calm down, tootsie pops.

10:27.574 --> 10:28.633
Sit down.

10:30.999 --> 10:32.723
Should I make it out to cash?

10:32.823 --> 10:34.842
No, just to the city.

10:35.831 --> 10:38.558
I don't have time to cash it.
They are going to tow my car at three.

10:45.399 --> 10:47.385
I'll call you tonight.

10:50.551 --> 10:52.024
Next!

10:55.319 --> 10:58.112
Hi, um... I have a boot on my car.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.466
We don't take checks.

11:00.566 --> 11:02.259
Oh, but, um... I just, I spoke to someone.

11:02.359 --> 11:03.799
We don't take checks, people!

11:04.567 --> 11:05.788
The lady on the phone.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.966
We don't take checks.

11:09.495 --> 11:11.197
The lady on the phone said you did.

11:13.847 --> 11:18.081
I'm sorry but what do her
DMV issues have to do with me?

11:22.327 --> 11:24.307
I want to talk about your doctor.

11:24.407 --> 11:26.012
- Who?
- Your shrink.

11:27.446 --> 11:29.727
I want to talk about Dr. Vanderark.

11:30.967 --> 11:31.891
Okay.

11:31.991 --> 11:34.099
I would appreciate it if you would
apologize to my secretary

11:34.199 --> 11:35.731
before you leave today.

11:35.831 --> 11:37.971
- Why?
- I think you know why.

11:38.071 --> 11:40.179
- Can I help you?
- I very seriously doubt it.

11:40.279 --> 11:43.191
You can't go in there, he's with
a patient, and you can not smoke!

11:44.599 --> 11:45.952
There. Happy?

11:48.919 --> 11:50.355
We'll come back to that.

11:50.455 --> 11:52.179
So you were making trouble

11:52.279 --> 11:54.515
while Athena was having her own problems.

11:54.615 --> 11:58.963
I mean what makes you think that I have
that kind of cash just lying around?

11:59.063 --> 12:01.889
Does it seem like I've been
lobotomized in the past six months?

12:07.735 --> 12:10.234
Turn around. Turn around!

12:12.535 --> 12:14.835
You know, you have a really
nice ass, Athena.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.019
You should think about
wearing shorter dresses.

12:21.559 --> 12:24.353
Okay, you can turn around.

12:25.783 --> 12:29.107
Now, why don't you take my car,

12:29.207 --> 12:30.835
you're gonna be
coming back here anyway, right?

12:30.935 --> 12:32.371
- Yeah.
- Yeah, good.

12:32.471 --> 12:34.872
Okay. It's yours.

12:36.118 --> 12:38.994
So she goes to this guy for cash
and gets the keys to the car.

12:39.094 --> 12:40.019
Uh-huh?

12:40.119 --> 12:43.507
The car that later breaks down
and bingo, he calls a tow truck, you!

12:43.607 --> 12:45.080
A tow truck?

12:45.399 --> 12:48.339
So now I'm a tow truck driver,
not an assassin?

12:48.439 --> 12:50.739
Well, every assassin has a cover, right?

12:50.839 --> 12:52.051
Yes, and you were saying?

12:52.151 --> 12:56.947
Oh, yeah. So, I went to go
kill this guy today, right.

12:57.047 --> 13:01.117
And before I did, I sorta said that
I thought that he might deserve it.

13:01.943 --> 13:05.235
And then I got to thinking about it
later and I realized that,

13:05.335 --> 13:09.779
that wasn't really a very nice
thing to say. So, I felt bad.

13:09.879 --> 13:13.075
- I wanna stop you right there, Ronda.
- Don't say it!

13:13.175 --> 13:15.378
Let's not get distracted
from the matter at hand.

13:15.478 --> 13:19.635
Why do you insist on this fantasy
of being an assassin?

13:19.735 --> 13:24.022
- It's not a fantasy. It's true.
- No. It's not.

13:25.782 --> 13:30.130
Personally, I think an assassin
sounds better than a tow truck driver.

13:30.230 --> 13:33.683
So now you're admitting to being
an assassin? Which is it?

13:33.783 --> 13:34.743
You tell me.

13:36.694 --> 13:38.080
Next.

13:43.383 --> 13:47.191
I'm back. And I have cash now.

14:04.983 --> 14:08.289
Eight hundred nineteen dollars,
twenty-three cents.

14:09.047 --> 14:10.617
Shit.

14:11.510 --> 14:12.929
The meter...

14:13.559 --> 14:16.734
I had to... I had to pay the meter
I must have miscalculated. I...

14:18.263 --> 14:23.064
This is all the money I have in the
world, I had to borrow it to pay this.

14:23.638 --> 14:25.722
So you have to pay the whole thing.

14:26.614 --> 14:28.979
Are you serious? It's ten cents.

14:29.079 --> 14:31.479
Sorry. You have to pay the whole thing.

14:36.630 --> 14:38.131
You're not sorry.

14:38.231 --> 14:42.226
Are you, you certainly should be.
But you're not. Not at all are you?

14:42.326 --> 14:43.745
- No.
- Shit!

14:45.558 --> 14:46.547
Next.

14:46.647 --> 14:48.819
No. Is this funny,
you think this is funny?

14:48.919 --> 14:52.594
You think it's funny that my car has a gaudy
hunk of orange metal on it right now,

14:52.694 --> 14:54.643
and the only way for me
to get it off before it gets towed

14:54.743 --> 15:00.691
is to borrow $819 from a man
I'm already indebted to

15:00.791 --> 15:02.515
for the rest of my natural life?

15:02.615 --> 15:04.595
You think it's funny that I got here
first thing this morning?

15:04.695 --> 15:07.442
I waited two fricken hours
only to have you to tell me

15:07.542 --> 15:11.667
I have to have cash, when I called
before to make sure you take checks

15:11.767 --> 15:13.331
and I was told that you do.

15:13.431 --> 15:15.122
Is there some sort of humor in the fact

15:15.222 --> 15:17.202
that it's now almost
four o'clock in the afternoon

15:17.302 --> 15:19.891
and for all I know you've towed my
fucking car already,

15:19.991 --> 15:23.635
and you can't help me out
with ten fucking cents.

15:23.735 --> 15:29.107
When I'm already paying $819
to you goddamn highway robber.

15:29.207 --> 15:30.738
Where's the fucking punchline, asshole?

15:30.838 --> 15:34.777
Because I'm obviously
not too quick on the pickup today.

15:35.990 --> 15:37.376
No.

15:37.943 --> 15:42.131
Sorry, you have to pay the whole thing.

15:42.231 --> 15:44.413
Does anyone have a dime I can borrow?

15:45.590 --> 15:47.773
It doesn't have to be a dime, um...

15:48.087 --> 15:49.472
Two nickles?

15:51.190 --> 15:52.978
Nickle and five pennies?

15:53.078 --> 15:55.806
- Anybody? Please?
- Sorry.

15:57.239 --> 15:59.105
Here, senorita.

15:59.927 --> 16:02.808
- Thank you. Thank you.
- De nada.

16:14.775 --> 16:19.259
Look, I'll grant you, I do enjoy
a little artistic flare here and there.

16:19.894 --> 16:22.655
It helps me fill in the occasional gap,
you know what I mean?

16:23.190 --> 16:25.569
I actually think that
it makes things more interesting.

16:27.095 --> 16:30.368
For example, the DMV may have
been a bit more like...

16:31.478 --> 16:33.694
Seriously, we don't take checks.

16:35.959 --> 16:37.619
As opposed to my version,

16:37.719 --> 16:40.600
which you have to admit
is far more entertaining, right?

16:46.295 --> 16:49.786
Here you are, picking up a payment.

16:51.863 --> 16:54.722
- Payment for what?
- For a hit, of course.

16:55.287 --> 16:58.610
- Oh, because I'm an assassin.
- Well, aren't you?

16:58.710 --> 17:00.478
What does the evidence say?

17:01.271 --> 17:04.691
You know, that park has had
security surveillance cameras

17:04.790 --> 17:06.611
in operation for over a decade?

17:06.711 --> 17:09.329
And they take a shot every 45 seconds.

17:09.430 --> 17:13.948
Oh, and please if you will,
Beatle, note the time stamp right there.

17:16.567 --> 17:18.387
You've got to fucking
love those things, right?

17:18.487 --> 17:22.675
They're absolutely incredible
at placing a certain individual

17:22.775 --> 17:27.226
in a certain spot, at a certain time,
Doing a certain thing.

17:27.991 --> 17:31.864
And in some cases,
committing a certain crime.

17:32.439 --> 17:34.578
- It's certainly detailed.
- Yeah.

17:34.678 --> 17:40.538
So while I may be guilty of peppering in
a little artistic flare here and there.

17:41.239 --> 17:45.560
The one thing that you can be sure of
is that where the facts are concerned,

17:46.646 --> 17:48.861
the parts that really matter,

17:49.719 --> 17:54.171
I absolutely have all the evidence
I need to take this to a court of law.

18:00.791 --> 18:02.940
Care to explain this receipt to me?

18:06.454 --> 18:08.504
I'll tell you what I think happened.

18:10.935 --> 18:13.619
Kyle's car breaks down
and he calls a towing company.

18:13.719 --> 18:19.219
You. You show up, you see
he's giving her a hard time.

18:19.319 --> 18:22.046
He's got his hands around her neck,
and he's strangling her.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.272
So you decide to knock him out, right.

18:32.055 --> 18:35.993
What did you use? A tire iron, a wrench?

18:36.886 --> 18:39.232
Come on, Beatle, am I getting warm?

18:44.631 --> 18:48.352
Beatle Boyin Towing/Assassination?

18:49.302 --> 18:52.242
You the mighty assassin, you bust up Kyle,

18:52.342 --> 18:55.420
and you whisk away
your damsel in distress, Athena.

18:55.959 --> 18:58.194
I've got to be getting
warm now, right, Beatle?

18:58.294 --> 18:59.832
I don't know.

19:00.151 --> 19:02.162
- You know what I think, Beatle?
- What?

19:02.262 --> 19:04.129
I think you were sweet on Athena.

19:09.814 --> 19:12.370
So, uh, how much do you charge?

19:12.470 --> 19:15.198
- Depends.
- On what?

19:15.574 --> 19:17.298
On what you're looking for.

19:17.398 --> 19:21.171
I give a discount for child molesters,
wife beaters, the occasional pimp.

19:21.271 --> 19:23.026
Also, you have to factor in travel,

19:23.126 --> 19:26.400
method of execution, risk...
yada, yada, yada.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.874
- What about me?
- What about you?

19:29.974 --> 19:31.676
How much for you to kill me?

19:35.702 --> 19:38.103
- You ever mess with a kid?
- No.

19:43.511 --> 19:45.595
This should answer
any questions you might have.

19:48.950 --> 19:50.751
You put this in writing?

19:52.214 --> 19:54.419
Yeah, how else are you going to know
what you get yourself in to?

19:54.519 --> 19:57.879
What if you get caught?
Are you afraid they'll find this?

19:58.198 --> 20:00.599
Well, if I get caught then it
won't really matter will it?

20:02.678 --> 20:04.795
So, Athena Glendon.

20:05.878 --> 20:09.665
Any relation to the multi-billion
software company, Glendon?

20:10.550 --> 20:15.744
Barton Glendon is my father.
He disowned me years ago.

20:17.719 --> 20:19.639
- Is that why you want to die?
- No.

20:20.374 --> 20:22.098
So why do you want to die then?

20:22.198 --> 20:24.381
It's really none of your business, is it?

20:25.717 --> 20:27.474
Well, now my curiosity is peaked.

20:27.574 --> 20:31.538
- Aw, I'm so sorry about your...
- Okay, ladies, what's it gonna be?

20:31.638 --> 20:33.618
How's the eggs Florentine here?

20:33.718 --> 20:34.908
You gotta death wish?

20:37.494 --> 20:41.042
Uh, I guess I'll have one of these then.

20:41.142 --> 20:42.430
One of what, hon?

20:44.087 --> 20:45.938
The little eggy deally here.

20:46.038 --> 20:49.847
We've got umpteen egg dishes here,
sweetheart, which one do you want?

20:50.038 --> 20:51.228
This one.

20:52.758 --> 20:55.159
I left my glasses in my other apron.

20:58.678 --> 21:05.247
The egg-stra me-egga
Del-egg-table spec-egg-tacular.

21:09.110 --> 21:12.503
- And you?
- Um, nothing thank you.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.939
Eggs Florentine would be
a hell of a lot cheaper than me.

21:22.039 --> 21:25.825
Uh, probably, but I can't afford it.

21:26.550 --> 21:28.818
So now are you planning on
paying for me then?

21:28.918 --> 21:31.858
Well, I have a life insurance policy.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.522
It's the one thing my parents
didn't take away from me.

21:33.622 --> 21:38.322
So, I figure I'd change it,
make you the beneficiary.

21:38.422 --> 21:39.698
More than cover your fee.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.939
You just have this
all figured out don't you?

21:42.039 --> 21:45.266
I need a place to stay
while I work out the details.

21:45.366 --> 21:48.819
As soon as, uh, Kyle wakes up
from the coma, you put him in,

21:48.919 --> 21:51.319
he's gonna come looking for me.

21:52.151 --> 21:54.977
- And?
- He'll kill me.

21:57.814 --> 22:00.146
Well, it seems you'd be saving us
both a whole lot of trouble then

22:00.246 --> 22:01.906
if you just went home
and got knocked out for free.

22:02.006 --> 22:04.146
Not like that, not by him.

22:04.246 --> 22:06.066
What difference does it make who does it?

22:06.166 --> 22:07.826
You serious?

22:07.926 --> 22:10.066
Yeah, I mean, who cares as long as
the job gets done?

22:10.166 --> 22:13.074
- I do.
- And I'm asking you why?

22:13.174 --> 22:14.386
Because I hate him.

22:14.486 --> 22:16.466
And I don't want my last moments
on this earth to be spent

22:16.566 --> 22:17.984
anywhere near him, I just...

22:18.870 --> 22:21.304
I can't think of
a worse tragedy than that.

22:22.519 --> 22:24.978
And what makes you think that
spending your last moments with me

22:25.078 --> 22:26.268
is going to be any better?

22:28.886 --> 22:30.304
I like you.

22:40.247 --> 22:42.647
Randy, I'm really confused.

22:43.606 --> 22:46.194
Detective Hult.

22:46.294 --> 22:48.914
What's this first degree murder charge
you're threatening me with?

22:49.014 --> 22:50.684
Don't play stupid.

22:52.214 --> 22:55.059
Is the possibility of
a death sentence not enough for you?

22:55.159 --> 22:58.354
- Huh?
- The death penalty for killing who?

22:58.454 --> 23:00.306
Okay, let me get this straight.

23:00.406 --> 23:03.418
Are you saying that
this story so far is not true?

23:04.503 --> 23:06.107
I'm not saying anything.

23:14.262 --> 23:15.353
Bruce?

23:20.374 --> 23:21.563
Bummer.

23:22.391 --> 23:24.978
Look, boss, she can't get too far
without cash or a car.

23:25.078 --> 23:26.674
Just find the gypsy, you'll find Athena.

23:26.774 --> 23:28.978
Actually, boss, I think
the proper term would be.

23:29.078 --> 23:31.570
Roma or Romani, not Gypsy.

23:31.670 --> 23:34.706
Yeah, you see it's a common
misconception stemming from

23:34.806 --> 23:37.106
the erroneous conjecture
that the Roma or Romani,

23:37.206 --> 23:39.058
if you will, originated in Egypt.

23:39.158 --> 23:40.754
Recent studies have shown
the fact that they...

23:40.854 --> 23:43.102
Bruce. Just find them.

23:45.206 --> 23:48.018
Oh, and Bruce, don't touch either of them.

23:48.118 --> 23:51.162
Bring them both back here.
I want to help this time.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.295
You in some kind of a coma or something?

24:35.959 --> 24:37.202
Seriously, should I be looking for

24:37.302 --> 24:39.474
a piece of candy
or a wallet to shove in your mouth?

24:39.574 --> 24:42.880
Maybe one of those long ass needles
to plunge into your chest?

24:44.630 --> 24:45.689
Hello?

24:48.470 --> 24:50.783
Why do you have
a wall full of dead spiders?

24:53.174 --> 24:55.968
Oh, yeah. Those...

24:56.726 --> 24:59.922
I keep them there as kind of
a warning to any other spiders

25:00.022 --> 25:01.394
that might wander through here.

25:01.494 --> 25:04.178
That way they can glimpse their
fate and decide whether or not

25:04.278 --> 25:05.746
they want to hang around to meet it.

25:05.846 --> 25:10.130
Huh, and did it ever occur
you after the fourth or fifth time

25:10.230 --> 25:12.882
that your plan wasn't working out so well?

25:12.982 --> 25:14.034
What do you mean?

25:14.134 --> 25:17.714
Are you serious, there has got to be
97 spiders on this wall.

25:17.814 --> 25:18.738
And?

25:18.838 --> 25:21.874
And they don't understand they're spiders.

25:21.974 --> 25:23.762
How do you know they don't understand,

25:23.862 --> 25:26.226
are you some very unusual spider psychic?

25:26.326 --> 25:29.778
Are there perished souls
speaking to you right now, Ms. Cleo?

25:29.878 --> 25:32.722
I'm looking at the wall and I'm taking
a wild stab in the dark here,

25:32.822 --> 25:35.666
I'm guessing, if they understood your
twisted little warning sign,

25:35.766 --> 25:38.162
probably wouldn't be
a part of it right now.

25:38.262 --> 25:40.306
So in your infinitely wise logic

25:40.406 --> 25:42.546
that I am obviously
too cabbage-headed to grasp.

25:42.646 --> 25:45.074
You're saying that if those spiders
knew that if I was going to kill them

25:45.174 --> 25:46.674
then they wouldn't be in my house. Right?

25:46.774 --> 25:47.698
Now you're catching on.

25:47.798 --> 25:51.704
Because if they knew and they stayed,
that would make them what?

25:52.630 --> 25:53.819
What would that make them?

25:55.638 --> 25:59.130
So there is a wall full of dead spiders?

26:00.374 --> 26:01.906
What does that have to do with anything?

26:02.006 --> 26:03.314
It has to do with you, Beatle.

26:03.414 --> 26:07.602
Your character, you're a killer
and you enjoy killing things.

26:07.702 --> 26:12.786
So this is just me letting you know
that I know, I see it,

26:12.886 --> 26:15.002
and I'm going to make sure a jury sees it.

26:15.766 --> 26:20.145
So you think that I kill things
because I enjoy it?

26:20.245 --> 26:22.994
Maybe, then again, maybe not.

26:23.094 --> 26:26.138
I don't know,
I'm not a psychiatrist I'm a cop.

26:26.870 --> 26:31.387
The point is you entered into a contract
with Athena Clendon to kill her.

26:36.278 --> 26:38.329
Change that life insurance policy yet?

26:38.934 --> 26:40.440
Yes.

26:40.950 --> 26:43.580
It takes seven to ten
business days before it's final.

26:44.822 --> 26:47.965
- Seven to ten business days, huh?
- Why?

26:48.693 --> 26:51.999
The assassination fee's one thing,
but room and board for two weeks?

26:52.758 --> 26:54.642
We're going to have to
work something out here.

26:54.742 --> 26:57.394
I told you, I don't have any money. Okay?

26:57.494 --> 26:59.954
And just because my last name is Glendon,

27:00.054 --> 27:01.874
don't think you'll see
a dime of that money either.

27:01.974 --> 27:04.658
You... You could chop off
my tits and send them to him

27:04.758 --> 27:06.738
in an empty Ding-Dong box,
they wouldn't even send you

27:06.838 --> 27:08.274
a quarter and a pack of chewing gum.

27:08.374 --> 27:10.002
So whatever's going through
your head right now...

27:10.102 --> 27:11.570
Whoa, there, hose. Reel it in.

27:11.670 --> 27:13.618
Nobody is talking about
medieval torture around here.

27:13.718 --> 27:15.901
I'm not even talking about money,
for fucks sake.

27:19.030 --> 27:23.282
Oh... Now I get...

27:23.382 --> 27:26.296
My gaydar isn't quite as acute
as it used to be but it...

27:26.998 --> 27:28.082
It makes sense.

27:28.182 --> 27:30.746
Um, before you embarrass
yourself even further.

27:31.798 --> 27:33.303
I'm not talking about sex either.

27:34.582 --> 27:36.960
You don't want money, you don't want sex.

27:37.174 --> 27:39.858
Right. Well, not from you anyway.

27:39.958 --> 27:41.458
What do you mean not from me?

27:41.558 --> 27:43.921
I... I happen to be
a very attractive woman.

27:44.021 --> 27:46.258
Who most people would cut
their right arm off to be with.

27:46.358 --> 27:47.282
When I was in high school...

27:47.382 --> 27:48.882
Why is everything an amputation with you?

27:48.982 --> 27:52.274
Every other sentence out of your mouth, some
unfortunate asshole is loosing a body part.

27:52.374 --> 27:56.242
- It's a little weird.
- Okay, what do you want me to do?

27:56.342 --> 27:58.418
Because I'm not sticking around
here if it's not kosher.

27:58.518 --> 28:00.766
I need you to help me with my infomercial.

28:02.486 --> 28:06.491
Infomercial? Of course, that
would have been my next guess.

28:08.086 --> 28:09.374
So we have a deal?

28:10.358 --> 28:13.073
Yeah, yeah, I think I can handle that.

28:13.173 --> 28:14.098
Good.

28:14.198 --> 28:16.543
We can talk about this further
when I get back from my shrink.

28:25.366 --> 28:28.247
- Why do you want to die again?
- Nice try.

28:29.845 --> 28:32.754
So now you've actually got
your next hit living with you,

28:32.854 --> 28:35.353
not to mention she's helping you
out with your business.

28:35.798 --> 28:39.314
- Of being an assassin.
- Yes, exactly.

28:39.414 --> 28:41.847
But what does any of this
have to do with Bruce?

28:44.149 --> 28:45.787
I want to talk about Carla.

28:46.262 --> 28:49.010
Randy. You're all over the place.

28:49.110 --> 28:50.430
It's Detective Hult.

28:51.766 --> 28:54.994
- This isn't making any sense.
- Then start making sense, Beatle.

28:55.094 --> 28:57.211
It's up to you to make sense, not me.

28:57.878 --> 28:59.057
I know my story.

28:59.157 --> 29:02.802
I know my case. I've been working
on this for seven years now.

29:02.902 --> 29:06.743
- So you start making sense.
- Okay.

29:07.638 --> 29:10.017
Tell me about the last time you saw Carla.

29:19.158 --> 29:20.242
Okay...

29:20.342 --> 29:22.801
Alright, who are you and what
have you done with my favorite trick?

29:22.901 --> 29:23.839
Huh?

29:24.342 --> 29:28.146
Well, I don't know, I mean, you know,
it's like you're not here or something.

29:28.246 --> 29:29.403
Is everything okay?

29:33.046 --> 29:35.410
I don't know, that's what I was
sitting here trying to figure out.

29:35.510 --> 29:39.314
Well, you are not only just sitting here,

29:39.414 --> 29:43.698
you happen to be sitting here
with the most talented mouth

29:43.798 --> 29:46.395
this side of the continental divide.

29:58.742 --> 30:03.729
Jesus! Can you fucking pretend to have
some sexual etiquette or something?

30:03.829 --> 30:05.084
Act like you're having fun.

30:13.014 --> 30:14.487
Alright, look, you know...

30:14.997 --> 30:17.725
Don't get it twisted
or anything because I...

30:21.270 --> 30:24.347
I like you a lot, but you're still
going to have to pay me so...

30:27.766 --> 30:28.923
You like me?

30:31.542 --> 30:33.015
Sure.

30:34.870 --> 30:36.489
That's strange.

30:37.878 --> 30:40.573
Okay, I'll bite, why?

30:45.238 --> 30:50.170
That's the, um... second time this week
that somebody's said that to me.

30:53.238 --> 30:55.137
The first time was the first time.

30:56.789 --> 31:01.623
- I don't understand.
- Ever. In my life.

31:02.678 --> 31:04.315
Are you shitting me?

31:06.902 --> 31:07.993
No.

31:08.694 --> 31:10.167
Beatle.

31:16.502 --> 31:19.328
What was your relationship
with Athena Glendon?

31:20.533 --> 31:23.228
I really don't think
that that's any of your business.

31:26.133 --> 31:27.071
Friends?

31:28.630 --> 31:30.681
Maybe a little more than friends?

31:36.278 --> 31:38.577
You know the bartender at St. Mary's

31:38.677 --> 31:41.471
said you two
were getting a little cozy together.

31:45.654 --> 31:47.356
Really cozy together.

31:49.333 --> 31:53.054
It's very interesting kind of stuff
they have here at your bar.

31:54.518 --> 31:55.577
Yeah.

31:55.830 --> 31:59.858
It's, you know, the local dive bar.

31:59.958 --> 32:00.950
Right.

32:02.902 --> 32:04.539
Well, cheers.

32:04.918 --> 32:06.074
Cheers.

32:06.934 --> 32:08.833
- You should do that more often.
- Hm?

32:09.141 --> 32:10.298
Smile.

32:11.509 --> 32:12.764
Okay.

32:13.333 --> 32:15.253
I'll try to do that more.

32:22.710 --> 32:26.878
Okay, Beatle Boyin.
Where, where can you be?

32:36.629 --> 32:40.503
I see London, I see France.

32:57.493 --> 32:59.545
What time are you out of here, sweetheart?

33:05.654 --> 33:07.007
Two o'clock.

33:09.558 --> 33:12.636
So have you ever been in a relationship?

33:13.717 --> 33:15.922
Yes. I have.

33:16.022 --> 33:18.769
Well, I... I meant a serious relationship.

33:18.869 --> 33:20.945
Yes. Very serious.

33:21.045 --> 33:23.346
Did it end badly with him or something?

33:23.446 --> 33:25.393
- Her.
- Oh...

33:25.493 --> 33:26.617
Um...

33:29.238 --> 33:33.938
She was into this whole subculture thing

33:34.038 --> 33:35.936
that was happening in Portland
at the time and...

33:41.366 --> 33:43.319
I just wanted to make her happy.

33:45.718 --> 33:47.322
What kind of subculture?

33:48.950 --> 33:50.482
She liked to bite.

33:50.582 --> 33:53.015
Oh, wow.

33:53.398 --> 33:56.977
- Well, was that a bad thing?
- With fangs.

33:57.077 --> 33:59.922
- Oh, wow.
- So... a little weird.

34:00.022 --> 34:02.737
Yeah. That's really weird.

34:02.837 --> 34:06.198
Kinda sounds like a really great
way to get AIDS, too.

34:12.310 --> 34:13.434
Oh...

34:14.166 --> 34:17.393
It's a bill for a blow job,
250 if you want to go all the way.

34:17.494 --> 34:20.440
Anything else you want to
incorporate is obviously extra.

34:21.717 --> 34:25.617
Um... I'm as flexible as your wallet is.

34:25.717 --> 34:29.504
So if you have any kinky shit you want
to do just make sure you can pay for it.

34:35.989 --> 34:37.527
So, what's it going to be?

34:38.389 --> 34:40.603
You and me
need to have a little chit chat.

34:41.333 --> 34:44.214
No! No! No! No!

34:49.652 --> 34:52.466
- Ladies, here you go.
- Thank you, Katie.

34:52.565 --> 34:54.545
- You're welcome.
- You're so sweet.

34:54.646 --> 34:56.446
I know.

34:59.413 --> 35:02.141
- So, Beatle.
- Hmm?

35:04.469 --> 35:06.008
How are you going to kill me?

35:09.046 --> 35:13.521
Um... I'm working on that.

35:13.621 --> 35:16.561
- Oh.
- Yeah... I'll figure it out.

35:16.661 --> 35:17.905
- You'll figure it out?
- Yeah.

35:18.005 --> 35:20.089
- Well, let me know.
- Okay.

35:22.549 --> 35:26.423
I told you already. I don't know
who you're fucking talking about!

35:29.589 --> 35:31.218
Well, my dear.

35:31.318 --> 35:34.875
That is just really, really
unfortunate for you.

35:42.390 --> 35:43.928
You know...

35:46.326 --> 35:48.988
I would imagine
that in your line of work...

35:50.422 --> 35:54.709
physical perfection is almost
a pre-requisite.

35:57.109 --> 35:58.258
What do you think?

35:58.358 --> 36:00.791
Would that be a safe assumption to make?

36:13.173 --> 36:14.385
What's that?

36:14.485 --> 36:16.350
What, this little thing?

36:18.148 --> 36:20.179
It's just a little acid.

36:21.846 --> 36:22.904
No big whoop.

36:28.245 --> 36:30.394
No...

36:30.933 --> 36:32.800
No!

36:36.085 --> 36:38.682
I'm going to tell you something,
this is only going to hurt for...

36:41.141 --> 36:42.746
No!

36:43.638 --> 36:46.737
Who am I kidding, this is going
to be fucking excruciating.

36:46.837 --> 36:48.637
No!

36:53.590 --> 36:56.277
I want you to open
your mouth and say, ahh.

37:00.083 --> 37:02.171
And now you want to be silent?

37:02.645 --> 37:03.671
Okay.

37:05.077 --> 37:07.576
No! No!

37:11.957 --> 37:14.751
Yeah, you know what,
that's going to leave a fucking soar.

37:27.157 --> 37:29.393
You want to get killed, do that again.

37:29.493 --> 37:31.261
Okay.

37:39.093 --> 37:40.031
You okay?

37:48.021 --> 37:49.247
Thanks.

37:54.645 --> 37:56.282
Ew, what is that?

37:56.725 --> 37:58.744
It's warm milk.

37:59.861 --> 38:02.044
Isn't milk suppose to be cold?

38:03.285 --> 38:06.385
Didn't your... didn't your mom
ever give you warm milk

38:06.485 --> 38:07.609
when you were a kid?

38:10.869 --> 38:13.182
I don't know, I don't remember my mom.

38:14.101 --> 38:17.374
But I'd like to think that she's not
a complete tard so I'll go with no.

38:17.877 --> 38:20.157
You don't remember your mom?

38:21.429 --> 38:23.645
No. Why?

38:25.238 --> 38:28.249
Just sad, I mean, no wonder you're...

38:29.590 --> 38:31.194
No wonder I'm what?

38:33.621 --> 38:36.600
You have to admit
that you're not exactly normal, Beatle.

38:38.773 --> 38:40.689
I'm not one of the sheep.

38:40.789 --> 38:42.939
Yeah, right, thank God.

38:44.725 --> 38:49.617
It's like... you're all like
an army of fucking robots.

38:49.717 --> 38:53.144
Sad! I can't imagine living like that.

38:54.005 --> 38:58.481
Wait, where do you get off telling me
what I'm like? You don't even know me.

38:58.581 --> 39:01.522
I don't need to know you, you're one
of them, that's all I need to know.

39:01.622 --> 39:03.601
As opposed to what?
As opposed to being like you?

39:03.701 --> 39:07.665
- I'll pass, thanks.
- No. As opposed to being yourself.

39:07.765 --> 39:09.937
Try thinking for yourself for once.

39:10.037 --> 39:12.338
I do think for myself,
thank you very much.

39:12.438 --> 39:15.133
You think you do, but you don't,
that's the trap.

39:15.318 --> 39:17.118
Say, cheese.

39:24.629 --> 39:28.601
Aw, this is just the before picture.

39:30.774 --> 39:34.079
I got something I wanna show you.
I got it right here.

39:35.733 --> 39:37.151
You're gonna love this.

39:39.029 --> 39:42.422
Take a look. What do you think?

39:44.181 --> 39:47.803
I know, I realize that's just my first
try and it needs a little improvement.

39:48.853 --> 39:52.476
But what I need to do is...
a little something different right here.

39:58.133 --> 40:00.697
What was that? I couldn't quite hear you.

40:06.198 --> 40:07.224
Hm.

40:11.477 --> 40:12.732
Shh...

40:20.693 --> 40:21.883
There, there.

40:22.293 --> 40:23.614
Now...

40:25.333 --> 40:27.417
is there something
you'd like to say to me?

40:28.757 --> 40:30.590
Because now would be the time.

40:31.797 --> 40:35.322
You know where I found this little
psychotic book of horrors, Beatle?

40:36.149 --> 40:38.385
No, I can't say that I do.

40:38.485 --> 40:42.206
I found it in a box
with this camera in it. Your camera.

40:44.021 --> 40:46.193
You know, if you don't
speak to me I can't help you.

40:46.293 --> 40:49.713
Is that what you're doing here?
You're helping me?

40:49.813 --> 40:52.305
Yeah, I'm trying to.

40:52.405 --> 40:55.832
Whatever you think,
I'm not out to get you. Okay?

40:56.597 --> 40:59.958
In fact, I think
you and I are very similar.

41:22.709 --> 41:23.963
Oh, good, you're up.

41:24.693 --> 41:29.265
What? I didn't know I had all this food.

41:29.365 --> 41:30.929
Oh, believe me, you didn't.

41:31.029 --> 41:35.057
You... you had a can
of pork and beans, circa 1936

41:35.157 --> 41:36.785
and a box of baking soda in the fridge.

41:36.885 --> 41:38.929
And I gotta admit,
I was tempted by that pork and beans

41:39.029 --> 41:41.369
because I'm pretty sure that can
showed all signs of botulism.

41:41.589 --> 41:46.033
But then I realized as another benefit
connected with my new outlook on life.

41:46.133 --> 41:48.337
I can eat whatever I want.
Isn't that fabulous?

41:48.437 --> 41:50.769
So I kind of decided,
over the course of the next week.

41:50.869 --> 41:53.169
I'm gonna try something new
every single day.

41:53.269 --> 41:56.695
I am throwing caution to the wind
when it comes to calorie intake.

41:57.909 --> 41:59.993
Sit, eat. I made this for both of us.

42:00.789 --> 42:01.905
- You did?
- Of course I did, sweetie.

42:02.005 --> 42:05.660
I may not be counting calories,
but my stomach is only so big.

42:07.157 --> 42:09.329
- What?
- Did you just call me sweetie?

42:09.429 --> 42:13.980
Oh, so I did. Just came out.
I decided not to edit myself.

42:16.405 --> 42:18.139
You're gonna get a kick out of this, too.

42:18.773 --> 42:20.753
I got all of these groceries for free.

42:20.853 --> 42:23.057
Really, how'd you swing that one?

42:23.157 --> 42:25.617
Flash the grocer
in the ten items or less aisle?

42:25.717 --> 42:27.921
No, but I'll remember that for next time.

42:28.021 --> 42:30.801
All I did was fill up my cart
and walk out of the store.

42:30.901 --> 42:32.657
About 15 people watched me do it, too.

42:32.757 --> 42:35.769
It was like their brains couldn't
process that somebody would just.

42:36.085 --> 42:38.962
Walk out of the store with a cart full
of groceries she didn't even pay for.

42:42.101 --> 42:44.250
What... what's wrong, it's not good?

42:44.853 --> 42:48.508
Uh, no I'm just not used to all this.

42:49.365 --> 42:50.619
Used to what, honey?

42:55.797 --> 42:57.270
Everything.

42:59.125 --> 43:00.945
Nothing, nothing.

43:01.045 --> 43:01.983
Eat.

43:04.725 --> 43:05.784
Wow.

43:07.925 --> 43:09.977
She really cared for you didn't she?

43:11.029 --> 43:12.861
That must've felt good, right?

43:16.373 --> 43:21.233
And now, she's cooking me breakfast,
she's calling me "baby" and "honey"

43:21.333 --> 43:25.649
and "sweetie", and then,
last night, she hugged me.

43:25.749 --> 43:28.575
I mean, it's all too much.

43:29.972 --> 43:31.792
So, let me get this straight,

43:31.892 --> 43:34.737
you came bursting into my office
claiming to have a serious emergency,

43:34.837 --> 43:36.785
while just to go on and on
for the last half hour

43:36.885 --> 43:39.153
about the fact that
another human being treated you kindly.

43:39.253 --> 43:41.777
Thanks for the instant reply, doc.

43:41.877 --> 43:44.977
Now I know you were paying attention,
but that does nothing to help me.

43:45.077 --> 43:46.910
Help you with what?

43:47.477 --> 43:50.041
You have a friend, that's a good thing.

43:51.189 --> 43:55.825
You're showing a range of emotions
that far exceed the neutral indifference

43:55.925 --> 43:57.976
that you've exhibited for years.

43:59.093 --> 44:04.025
You're making progress.
I don't see what the problem is.

44:04.501 --> 44:06.513
She hired me to kill her.

44:06.613 --> 44:09.649
Oh, shit, we are back to this again?

44:09.749 --> 44:13.109
She did! I have to kill her
in less than a week.

44:13.845 --> 44:16.726
Well, I guess you should enjoy it
while it lasts then.

44:18.101 --> 44:20.021
It's hard for you to open up, isn't it?

44:20.309 --> 44:22.327
Why do you think that is?

44:23.253 --> 44:25.719
I don't think, I know.

44:33.205 --> 44:34.513
Bruce, it's been two days,

44:34.613 --> 44:37.617
I don't think that I need
to tell you the amount of shit

44:37.717 --> 44:40.598
that you will be in
if I don't get my delivery.

44:42.357 --> 44:44.638
Say, cheese!

44:47.605 --> 44:49.983
Let me explain to you
what's going to happen here.

44:50.453 --> 44:55.057
I'm gonna very slowly peel
the toenail off your broken toe.

44:55.157 --> 44:58.577
Which will undoubtedly
jar that injury a bit,

44:58.677 --> 45:02.005
while at the same time,
creating an all together new wound.

45:03.189 --> 45:06.943
See the pain is basically going to be
focused on one area of your body,

45:07.861 --> 45:11.134
but it will be
two different torments, if you will.

45:12.533 --> 45:15.327
What I want you to do,
is I want you to tell me

45:15.924 --> 45:20.376
if you can feel both injuries at once or
you can only feel one thing at a time.

45:20.917 --> 45:25.434
Okie dokie artichokie?
Alright, here we go.

45:29.205 --> 45:31.354
What can I do for you today?

45:31.957 --> 45:33.681
- Enjoying the view?
- Oh...

45:33.781 --> 45:35.441
Oh, come on, don't let the fact
that I know what you're thinking

45:35.541 --> 45:37.585
- stop you from thinking it.
- Ma'am?

45:37.685 --> 45:39.761
You really going to mentally
fuck my brains out

45:39.861 --> 45:42.000
- than refer to me as ma'am?
- I assure you...

45:42.100 --> 45:43.985
- Are you Catholic?
- Sorry?

45:44.085 --> 45:47.504
- Are you a Catholic?
- Uh, yeah, I suppose.

45:47.604 --> 45:51.185
Okay, then do yourself a favor, Hugh.
Don't lie to me.

45:51.285 --> 45:52.401
Okay, I mean you've already got enough

45:52.501 --> 45:54.577
pointless guilt to wrestle with already,
don't you think?

45:54.677 --> 45:57.008
And if you finish that sentence,
you're just gonna be in confessional

45:57.108 --> 45:58.672
a few minutes longer than necessary.

45:58.772 --> 46:01.808
By the time you're done with all
your Hail Mary's and Our Father's,

46:01.908 --> 46:05.169
that's like a good five minutes
you could've spent jerking off.

46:05.269 --> 46:07.505
Any who, my friend gave me
a thousand bucks and told me

46:07.605 --> 46:11.227
to find the best video camera I can.
Suggestions?

46:11.796 --> 46:14.585
Shall we move on to the next foot now?

46:17.685 --> 46:19.289
You trying to say something, man?

46:22.485 --> 46:26.107
Ugh, Jesus. What you got?

46:27.093 --> 46:30.814
- Her file is in the desk.
- In the desk.

46:33.109 --> 46:35.377
As much as I'm enjoying
this psychological,

46:35.477 --> 46:38.769
and somewhat entertaining,
side to this case.

46:38.869 --> 46:42.193
I want to focus
on this right here, Beatle. Okay?

46:42.293 --> 46:47.159
Because this right here is the evidence
that proves you're a killer.

46:48.437 --> 46:50.129
You want to start co-operating?

46:50.229 --> 46:54.577
And remember, I'm not just the
spokesperson, I'm also a client.

46:54.677 --> 46:56.753
And by the time you see this infomercial,

46:56.853 --> 47:00.181
Beatle Boyin will have yet
another satisfied customer.

47:03.317 --> 47:05.019
Did you get it, because I'm gonna be dead?

47:06.037 --> 47:08.048
- Right.
- Right.

47:08.148 --> 47:09.207
Well...

47:11.732 --> 47:12.824
Beatle.

47:15.572 --> 47:18.673
You're not thinking about
pussying out on me are you?

47:18.773 --> 47:20.784
- No.
- No, because that would not be cool,

47:20.884 --> 47:22.065
because we have a deal.

47:22.165 --> 47:23.312
Yes, yes we have a deal.

47:23.412 --> 47:24.817
So you're gonna hold up
your end of the bargain?

47:24.917 --> 47:28.241
- Yes. Can we just move on, please?
- As long as we're clear.

47:28.341 --> 47:32.575
Yes. We are clear,
I will kill you, you will be dead. Okay?

47:33.077 --> 47:35.422
Good, let's do it again.

47:38.964 --> 47:43.067
I think its time for you to start
admitting how you felt about this girl.

47:44.149 --> 47:46.960
Why do we keep on going back to Athena,
when this is supposed to be about me

47:47.060 --> 47:49.553
being, what,
the killer of this guy named Bruce?

47:49.653 --> 47:50.973
Because I need a motive.

47:51.573 --> 47:55.217
Now, I think you killed Bruce
because he was on to Athena.

47:55.317 --> 47:58.513
Okay, so, I'm going to kill Athena.

47:58.613 --> 48:00.496
How many times have you found yourself

48:00.596 --> 48:04.049
in the awkward position
of having to ask a complete stranger

48:04.149 --> 48:07.025
in a public restroom
to provide you with toilet paper?

48:07.125 --> 48:08.062
Really?

48:09.236 --> 48:10.360
What?

48:11.604 --> 48:12.913
You have how much time left

48:13.013 --> 48:15.056
and you're really gonna spend it
watching television?

48:15.156 --> 48:16.208
I'm broke.

48:16.308 --> 48:17.246
So?

48:18.677 --> 48:22.268
So, unless you're offering to take me out
on a date I don't really have any options.

48:26.133 --> 48:27.868
You'd go out on a date with me?

48:29.204 --> 48:30.459
What you mean?

48:30.868 --> 48:32.505
If you approached me in a bar?

48:34.325 --> 48:37.164
Yeah, if I approached you in a bar
and I asked you out, what would you say?

48:38.101 --> 48:39.541
I'd probably say yes.

48:43.125 --> 48:44.112
Really?

48:44.212 --> 48:45.172
Yeah.

48:45.941 --> 48:50.742
You got that sexy sort of
bad ass thing happening.

48:52.501 --> 48:55.447
Wow. Who knew?

48:55.861 --> 48:58.929
But of course I'd have to tell you
I have AIDS and you'd probably

48:59.029 --> 49:02.935
retract the offer, so really, this
conversation is pointless, isn't it?

49:16.629 --> 49:19.424
Shipping not available in all states.
Some restrictions may...

49:21.429 --> 49:23.197
Will you go out with me tonight?

49:25.269 --> 49:26.458
Yes.

50:04.180 --> 50:05.873
How am I doing so far?

50:05.973 --> 50:08.951
Good. So far, so good.

50:10.548 --> 50:14.454
This is my first date, so I kinda
want to make sure I do it right.

50:16.245 --> 50:19.966
Are you serious?
You've never been on a date before?

50:20.916 --> 50:22.270
Never.

50:22.901 --> 50:26.654
Wow. Being a woman's first date.

50:27.957 --> 50:30.008
I feel so privileged.

50:30.452 --> 50:34.686
Got to be something to be said for it,
not really sure what it is but...

50:39.508 --> 50:41.756
- Does that mean you've never?
- What?

50:42.836 --> 50:44.091
You know?

50:44.468 --> 50:46.992
Oh, God, no. Of course I have.

50:47.092 --> 50:49.104
Well, I don't know,
if you've never dated...

50:49.204 --> 50:51.103
- I have a girl.
- Oh.

50:54.164 --> 50:57.873
What does that mean you have a girl?
Are you... are you in a relationship?

50:57.973 --> 50:59.511
Are you kidding?

51:00.084 --> 51:02.769
She's a stripper,
we see each other once a week.

51:02.869 --> 51:07.135
It's a mutually beneficial situation.

51:07.829 --> 51:09.137
She's a hooker.

51:09.237 --> 51:11.255
Okay, that's one way to put it.

51:16.725 --> 51:18.897
Okay, do you guys have one of
those weird relationships.

51:18.997 --> 51:21.392
Where one or both of you
has feelings for the other one?

51:21.492 --> 51:24.209
Why are we still talking about this,
it's really insignificant.

51:24.309 --> 51:26.737
Because sometimes people
get really attached,

51:26.837 --> 51:28.784
and it turns into this whole big thing.

51:28.884 --> 51:31.729
Athena, I've never been attached
to anyone before in my life.

51:31.829 --> 51:35.189
Before you I've never felt
anything for... anyone.

51:44.372 --> 51:47.185
They have an excellent tortilla soup here,

51:47.285 --> 51:49.105
you should try it if you've never had it.

51:49.205 --> 51:52.432
Tortilla soup, it's good.
It sounds... good.

51:52.532 --> 51:53.689
Good.

51:55.252 --> 51:57.685
- Ah, excuse me.
- Uh-huh.

52:02.580 --> 52:05.308
Hi, I'd like to place
an order for delivery, please.

52:38.644 --> 52:40.663
Okay, so, just wait here.

53:04.085 --> 53:06.513
You know, I totally
couldn't find that light switch.

53:06.613 --> 53:08.282
- Who the hell are you?
- Bruce.

53:10.453 --> 53:14.010
Athena, looking lovely as always.

53:14.484 --> 53:16.144
We'll see if we can't
change that, shall we?

53:16.244 --> 53:19.024
Beatle, we have to go, he'll kill us.

53:19.124 --> 53:21.525
Now, now, Athena,
no one's going to get killed.

53:22.229 --> 53:23.664
I'm just going to take you
both over to Kyle's

53:23.764 --> 53:27.420
and see what happens after that.
Okie dokie?

53:28.020 --> 53:31.381
- Hold it right there, don't move.
- Or what?

53:31.668 --> 53:33.884
Huh? What you want to do?

53:36.692 --> 53:39.899
Beatle, come on. Beatle, Beatle!

53:42.836 --> 53:45.783
Maybe you ought to call her Ronda
that'll get your attention.

53:47.028 --> 53:49.178
Oh, really?

53:49.524 --> 53:53.840
You haven't told her yet?
Did I let the cat out of the bag?

53:53.940 --> 53:56.319
Shame on me.

53:56.916 --> 53:58.128
Let go of her.

53:58.228 --> 54:00.752
What do you suppose the chances are?

54:00.852 --> 54:02.801
Of you actually hitting me
with that bullet.

54:02.901 --> 54:05.808
Without accidentally hitting your
bestest friend

54:05.908 --> 54:08.440
in the whole world here, in the process?

54:09.140 --> 54:11.024
I said, let go of her.

54:11.124 --> 54:15.607
You know what, I'm feeling pretty
fucking lucky, I'm going to call your bluff.

54:16.083 --> 54:18.736
- Stop it, let her go!
- Make me.

54:18.836 --> 54:22.384
Actually surprised you haven't heard
the story, it's a really good one.

54:22.484 --> 54:23.990
One more step and I'll shoot you.

54:24.852 --> 54:27.230
I guess I'll tell her the story myself.

54:27.669 --> 54:29.392
It goes a little something like this.

54:29.492 --> 54:33.277
Once upon a time,
there was this crazy cult.

54:34.676 --> 54:36.062
The end.

54:39.092 --> 54:40.598
Are you okay?

54:41.524 --> 54:43.792
- Call the cops.
- Beatle, what are you talking about?

54:43.892 --> 54:46.192
- Call the cops!
- Beatle, you don't want the cops here.

54:46.292 --> 54:48.880
This is an apartment complex,
people notice things like gun shots,

54:48.980 --> 54:51.064
- work with me here, please.
- Okay.

54:56.852 --> 54:58.074
I'm sorry.

54:59.957 --> 55:01.179
I'm sorry.

55:02.548 --> 55:04.731
It's okay.
I'm calling, I'm calling right now.

55:12.596 --> 55:15.120
Thank you, Ms. Glendon. We'll be in touch.

55:15.220 --> 55:16.212
Thanks.

55:19.540 --> 55:23.097
Well, as far as I can tell
this is an open and shut case.

55:24.053 --> 55:28.155
Trespassing, self defense, What have you.

55:29.044 --> 55:32.538
But I will need you to stay in town
until the official investigation is over.

55:32.916 --> 55:35.184
You understand? Okay, great.

55:35.284 --> 55:38.180
Here's my card. If you have any
questions, feel free to call me.

55:44.628 --> 55:49.789
- You know... I don't understand...
- Please... don't, okay.

55:56.372 --> 55:59.088
You weren't expecting Kyle
to clear out Bruce's things

55:59.188 --> 56:01.501
and put them in storage
for seven years, now were you?

56:02.068 --> 56:05.264
Including your video camera
that he took from your towing office.

56:05.364 --> 56:09.552
Which features a taped confession
about being an assassin.

56:09.652 --> 56:11.632
So where's the tape
showing me saying that?

56:11.732 --> 56:14.165
You really think we don't have it? Hmm?

56:14.804 --> 56:17.713
Anyway, you think the tape
is going to make or break this case?

56:17.813 --> 56:21.008
I mean look around you,
this file on its own!

56:21.108 --> 56:22.288
All fantasy.

56:22.388 --> 56:24.821
And besides we've got you
taking payments for those hits.

56:28.404 --> 56:30.032
This could be anyone.

56:30.132 --> 56:33.456
But it's not, Beatle. It's you, isn't it?

56:33.556 --> 56:35.705
Now I've been very patient here, alright?

56:36.212 --> 56:39.184
But I'm starting to get very tired
with this conversation, Beatle.

56:39.284 --> 56:40.304
Yeah, me too.

56:40.404 --> 56:43.504
Yeah? Why are you getting tired?

56:43.604 --> 56:46.266
Because of the way that
you have this story in your head.

56:46.740 --> 56:51.569
You already have me tried and convicted,
and it feels like nothing I say

56:51.669 --> 56:55.956
is going to convince you otherwise.
So... why should I bother?

56:57.364 --> 56:58.652
Try me.

57:00.052 --> 57:05.977
I think there's a chance that you
believe it's possible, just possible,

57:06.324 --> 57:11.216
that things happened differently
then the way you presented them here.

57:11.316 --> 57:17.077
That there might be another explanation
for why things are the way they are.

58:05.396 --> 58:06.618
Shh, it's okay.

58:08.628 --> 58:12.534
It was a nightmare. It's okay. It's okay.

58:18.196 --> 58:19.549
Drink some of this.

58:46.036 --> 58:47.706
Who's Ronda?

58:50.740 --> 58:52.213
I have no idea.

58:54.420 --> 58:56.220
What? I never heard of her.

58:57.972 --> 59:00.155
You know what, if you're not
gonna be honest with me.

59:05.140 --> 59:07.486
- What?
- Something reeks.

59:14.100 --> 59:15.900
I don't smell anything.

59:16.692 --> 59:18.454
Are you kidding me?

59:20.691 --> 59:22.128
No.

59:22.228 --> 59:24.144
Okay, so I'll break out some Lysol.

59:24.244 --> 59:25.264
Beatle, what are you doing?

59:25.364 --> 59:28.208
You have to get whatever's down there,
out of there. This is not pretty.

59:28.308 --> 59:30.294
There is nothing down there!

59:35.924 --> 59:37.179
I'm sorry.

59:39.508 --> 59:43.229
Alright, look,
it's where I keep my money stashed.

59:44.116 --> 59:45.776
Money doesn't smell like that.

59:45.876 --> 59:48.178
Well, that's all it is, babe,
I don't know what too tell you.

59:49.588 --> 59:52.272
Why do I feel like
I'm getting tricked around here?

59:52.372 --> 59:56.093
I don't know, you're not.
Jesus, paranoid much?

59:59.636 --> 01:00:02.494
What's going on Beatle? Huh?

01:00:04.564 --> 01:00:05.950
Who's Ronda?

01:00:06.996 --> 01:00:08.567
What are you not telling me?

01:00:08.788 --> 01:00:12.509
And what for the love of all
things holy is under the bed?

01:00:14.996 --> 01:00:16.087
Fine.

01:00:18.964 --> 01:00:21.103
No, get away from there. Get away!

01:00:21.203 --> 01:00:23.576
Get off of me.

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:26.352
Shit! Get the fuck off of me, Beatle!

01:00:26.452 --> 01:00:28.752
What's under the bed, huh?
What are you hiding? Huh?

01:00:28.852 --> 01:00:30.128
- Business, Athena.
- Huh?

01:00:30.228 --> 01:00:32.541
Get the... fuck off of me!

01:00:33.268 --> 01:00:34.687
Oh...

01:00:36.436 --> 01:00:37.527
You thought...

01:00:39.156 --> 01:00:41.008
My shrink gave me that shit.

01:00:41.108 --> 01:00:44.469
He thinks I have a problem,
but I don't. So can we drop this now?

01:00:45.268 --> 01:00:47.408
Why would he think you have
a problem that you don't have?

01:00:47.508 --> 01:00:49.616
I don't know! He also doesn't
think I'm an assassin.

01:00:49.716 --> 01:00:52.248
But as you and I both know,
that's not true either.

01:00:54.356 --> 01:00:56.985
I actually don't have any proof
that you're an assassin.

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:01.584
Um, you hired me too kill you, remember?

01:01:01.684 --> 01:01:04.029
And I am still very much alive, aren't I?

01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:10.480
Fine, screw you, you want to believe?

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:12.816
I don't need this shit from you,
if you want to believe some asshole

01:01:12.916 --> 01:01:14.352
you've never even met before, over me,

01:01:14.452 --> 01:01:16.560
then there's nothing
I can do about it, is there?

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:19.760
And maybe you can go hide out from your
little wannabe Tony Soprano fuck wad

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.296
at Dr. Vanderark's house.

01:01:21.396 --> 01:01:23.216
Because I sure as fuck
don't want you here.

01:01:23.316 --> 01:01:25.296
You know what, Beatle? I'm just trying
to figure out who the fuck you are.

01:01:25.396 --> 01:01:27.312
Well, go figure it out, somewhere else.

01:01:27.412 --> 01:01:28.400
Do you know what the books say?

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.712
Do you know what these books say, Beatle?

01:01:29.812 --> 01:01:32.143
These book say that you might be
acting out a fantasy life,

01:01:32.243 --> 01:01:34.063
that you might not
even know you're doing it.

01:01:34.163 --> 01:01:36.112
Please! What are you saying, sweetheart?

01:01:36.212 --> 01:01:38.198
Are you calling me a liar, huh?

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:41.840
Or maybe I'm just an idiot who's too retarded
to tell the difference between real life

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:43.708
and a fucking fantasy.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:48.624
Or maybe, maybe, maybe you're just
plain calling me crazy? Is that it?

01:01:48.724 --> 01:01:50.576
Do you think I'm fucking crazy?

01:01:50.676 --> 01:01:53.263
Huh? Because that's a laugh
coming from you,

01:01:53.363 --> 01:01:56.240
little miss, "I like to pretend
I'm a vampire and suck AIDS blood"

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:57.488
out of my girlfriends neck."

01:01:57.588 --> 01:02:01.244
Yeah, that's fucking funny.
Yeah, I'm the fucking crazy one, here!

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.322
What's under your fucking bed, Beatle?

01:02:09.683 --> 01:02:10.873
Money.

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.398
Show me. Show me, Beatle.

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:31.567
This isn't fucking money, Beatle.

01:02:31.667 --> 01:02:33.583
This is fucking trash!

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:35.536
This is garbage, you see this?

01:02:35.636 --> 01:02:38.560
Do you see that? Come look! Show me!

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.980
Show me!

01:02:40.116 --> 01:02:42.512
This is fucking garbage, Beatle. Look!

01:02:42.612 --> 01:02:46.608
Look in there! Look! Huh? Fucking trash!

01:02:46.708 --> 01:02:48.443
Trash!

01:02:51.284 --> 01:02:52.244
Look at me.

01:02:57.396 --> 01:02:59.611
You're not really an assassin, are you?

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:04.656
Say it. I want to hear you say it.

01:03:04.756 --> 01:03:08.029
I want to hear you say,
"I'm not really an assassin."

01:03:10.548 --> 01:03:11.672
Beatle.

01:03:16.644 --> 01:03:18.662
I don't even know your name.

01:03:21.356 --> 01:03:23.090
Wait.

01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:24.181
What?

01:03:27.892 --> 01:03:29.758
Did you know last night,

01:03:30.196 --> 01:03:33.338
last night I was actually
considering staying here with you.

01:03:34.356 --> 01:03:35.709
For a minute, I...

01:03:36.052 --> 01:03:38.878
I actually thought,
you know, what, this could be...

01:03:39.444 --> 01:03:41.551
This could be enough to change everything.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:44.729
I could deal with a situation, I could.

01:03:45.908 --> 01:03:47.503
But, obviously, you can't.

01:03:47.603 --> 01:03:50.000
I'm not gonna sit around
and watch you live a lie,

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:52.048
it's just something I don't have
the time or energy to do,

01:03:52.148 --> 01:03:54.647
for someone that won't even
tell me her name. I'm sorry.

01:04:05.907 --> 01:04:07.774
You're not an assassin?

01:04:08.948 --> 01:04:10.169
No.

01:04:16.084 --> 01:04:17.338
Who are you?

01:04:19.283 --> 01:04:20.756
Who do you think I am?

01:05:29.779 --> 01:05:31.034
This is you?

01:05:41.811 --> 01:05:43.382
Shh...

01:05:52.819 --> 01:05:54.619
Who is this girl, Randy?

01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:57.944
It's Detective Hult.

01:06:00.564 --> 01:06:02.415
Who is this girl, Randy?

01:06:02.515 --> 01:06:07.727
Detective Hult! Detective Hult!
Detective Hult! Detective Hult!

01:06:07.827 --> 01:06:08.912
Do you recognize the girl?

01:06:09.012 --> 01:06:12.431
I've just taken down
one of the biggest criminal masterminds

01:06:12.531 --> 01:06:17.943
in modern history, and I demand
a little respect from you now. Okay?

01:06:18.612 --> 01:06:21.136
I got him with all the evidence
I had and I'm going to get you

01:06:21.236 --> 01:06:24.662
with the same evidence right here,
it's here, right in front of me.

01:06:29.811 --> 01:06:31.546
Where's the tape?

01:06:32.883 --> 01:06:35.984
- Where did you put the tape?
- There is no tape, Randy.

01:06:36.084 --> 01:06:38.576
What do you mean there's no tape?
Where's the tape, it was right here.

01:06:38.676 --> 01:06:40.303
There never was a tape, Randy.

01:06:40.403 --> 01:06:43.536
There was a tape in there,
you stole it and that's another of fence.

01:06:43.636 --> 01:06:45.338
There was never a tape.

01:06:53.203 --> 01:06:55.070
Hello, Randy.

01:06:57.108 --> 01:06:59.737
What are you... What are you doing here?
You can't be in here.

01:07:00.979 --> 01:07:02.512
What's going on?
What are you doing in here?

01:07:02.612 --> 01:07:04.015
- You can't be in here.
- I'm here to help.

01:07:04.115 --> 01:07:05.616
No, wait a minute who let you in?
You can't be in here.

01:07:05.716 --> 01:07:08.944
I'm here to help, let's just talk.

01:07:09.044 --> 01:07:11.183
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Just come, sit down.

01:07:11.283 --> 01:07:14.032
- You can't be in here!
- It's okay, I just want to help.

01:07:14.132 --> 01:07:16.431
You can't even be in here.
You're gonna have to leave.

01:07:16.531 --> 01:07:18.384
You two can't be
in the same room together.

01:07:18.484 --> 01:07:19.663
Just gonna talk.

01:07:19.763 --> 01:07:22.288
- You gotta leave.
- No, no. I'll just be a minute.

01:07:22.388 --> 01:07:23.311
It's okay.

01:07:23.411 --> 01:07:26.327
Randy, why don't you just come over here
and have a conversation with us, okay?

01:07:26.932 --> 01:07:29.878
I don't know what's going on here,
I don't know why they let you in here.

01:07:30.131 --> 01:07:32.911
- Randy, we're your doctors.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:34.997
We're your doctors,
and we're here to help you.

01:07:36.147 --> 01:07:38.395
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:07:40.116 --> 01:07:41.720
I'm a cop.

01:07:42.003 --> 01:07:45.789
I'm a cop and I keep people safe.
That's what I do.

01:07:46.195 --> 01:07:48.541
I protect people, okay?

01:07:48.852 --> 01:07:50.736
And I make sure no body dies.

01:07:50.836 --> 01:07:51.993
Like Kyle Sullivan.

01:07:54.676 --> 01:07:56.751
The drunk driver that killed your family.

01:07:56.851 --> 01:07:59.472
- What are you talking about?
- That you murdered.

01:07:59.572 --> 01:08:01.972
- I'm not a murderer.
- Because he killed your wife.

01:08:03.187 --> 01:08:04.628
Carla.

01:08:05.971 --> 01:08:07.641
And your daughter.

01:08:10.195 --> 01:08:11.384
Remember that?

01:08:12.404 --> 01:08:14.903
I'm a detective. I don't kill people.

01:08:15.699 --> 01:08:17.237
It's true.

01:08:25.171 --> 01:08:27.125
This is your wife, Carla.

01:08:27.508 --> 01:08:30.544
She and your daughter were killed
when Kyle Sullivan crashed into

01:08:30.644 --> 01:08:32.662
your car while driving drunk.

01:08:35.636 --> 01:08:36.792
This is insane.

01:08:44.499 --> 01:08:47.854
I don't know who this is in this
picture, but it's not me, Randy.

01:08:47.955 --> 01:08:50.966
I'm your doctor. I'm Dr. Richards.

01:08:51.508 --> 01:08:53.689
We are both your doctors.

01:08:56.916 --> 01:08:58.040
You're Beatle.

01:09:00.243 --> 01:09:04.281
No. Beatle is a part
of yourself that's a murderer.

01:09:07.091 --> 01:09:08.432
You're Athena Glendon.

01:09:08.532 --> 01:09:12.880
No. I'm not Athena Glendon.
I'm Dr. Sharlett Lyn, I'm your doctor.

01:09:12.979 --> 01:09:15.991
And that picture is...
it's from my ID card.

01:09:16.627 --> 01:09:17.817
You see that?

01:09:19.252 --> 01:09:23.060
Athena, is the part of yourself
that wants to die.

01:09:30.772 --> 01:09:32.441
This is you, Randy.

01:09:33.044 --> 01:09:35.259
And this is your wife, Carla.

01:09:36.658 --> 01:09:40.303
And this... is your daughter.

01:09:40.403 --> 01:09:41.876
Ronda.

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:03.709
I don't understand anything.

01:10:05.843 --> 01:10:07.578
It's okay.

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:12.687
I'm a cop.

01:10:12.787 --> 01:10:15.133
No, Randy you're not a cop,
you're an engineer.

01:10:18.355 --> 01:10:20.156
And this is your family.

01:10:20.948 --> 01:10:23.032
- They're my family?
- Yeah.

01:10:30.036 --> 01:10:32.949
- It's okay, Randy.
- Why do I not remember this?

01:10:34.228 --> 01:10:35.995
We're here to help.

01:10:36.627 --> 01:10:38.711
You just have to trust us.

01:11:26.195 --> 01:11:27.800
You guys are good.

01:11:29.812 --> 01:11:31.033
Really good.

01:11:33.459 --> 01:11:35.161
But I know the truth.

01:11:36.403 --> 01:11:40.342
I'm not gonna stop
until everybody else does.

01:11:43.635 --> 01:11:46.134
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave,
Ms. Glendon.

01:11:47.092 --> 01:11:49.231
I'm in the middle
of a police investigation,

01:11:49.331 --> 01:11:50.703
and this is an interrogation room,

01:11:50.803 --> 01:11:53.498
and you two can not be in here
at the same time.

01:11:54.995 --> 01:11:56.184
So if you don't mind?

01:12:00.659 --> 01:12:03.540
Okay, detective.
Can I borrow you for a moment?

01:12:04.435 --> 01:12:07.791
It's okay. Go ahead.

01:12:07.891 --> 01:12:09.212
I'll wait for you.

01:12:12.371 --> 01:12:14.968
- We'll finish this later.
- Okay.

01:12:15.796 --> 01:12:16.887
Okay.

01:12:26.611 --> 01:12:28.367
It's been a long day today.

01:12:28.467 --> 01:12:30.202
Next time, okay?

01:12:30.803 --> 01:12:33.814
- We'll get there.
- Yeah, we will.

01:12:35.731 --> 01:12:37.071
Good job, detective.

01:12:37.171 --> 01:12:38.644
What do you got, detective?

01:12:45.235 --> 01:12:46.840
We were close.

01:12:48.499 --> 01:12:52.886
- Maybe next week.
- Yes. Maybe next week.

01:12:53.747 --> 01:12:56.463
Where do you think he gets this crazy idea

01:12:56.563 --> 01:12:58.582
that Beatle and Athena are together?

01:12:59.092 --> 01:13:04.438
Seems, um, pretty consistent
in the story don't you think?

01:13:05.683 --> 01:13:09.469
- It's always my favorite part.
- Mmm. You should do that more.

01:13:09.908 --> 01:13:13.749
Yeah, come on, let's go home.
Come on! Cheer up.

01:13:16.372 --> 01:13:17.693
After you.
