WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.003
(Karen)
Oh.

00:03.104 --> 00:04.238
That was delicious.

00:05.273 --> 00:06.440
You know, there's nothing like
a balanced breakfast

00:06.540 --> 00:08.209
to start your day off right.

00:08.309 --> 00:12.446
What's "balanced" about
nine uppers and an iced coffee?

00:12.546 --> 00:15.183
At home I had nine downers
and a hot tea.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.151
(Grace)
Oh!

00:17.251 --> 00:19.120
I'm so excited!

00:19.220 --> 00:21.155
The Sound of Music sing-along
is back.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.556
And I'm not missing it
this time.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.458
Oh, it's gonna be
so much fun.

00:24.558 --> 00:28.096
We can dress like the characters
and sing all the songs.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.231
Oh, we can go as Maria
and Captain Von Trapp.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.265
[screaming]
I call Maria!

00:33.601 --> 00:35.503
Well, I just hope
there aren't

00:35.603 --> 00:38.206
too many gay guys there
dressed like nuns.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.210
Brings back bad memories
of Catholic school.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.514
I don't know...

00:46.614 --> 00:47.815
Gay guys and sing-alongs.

00:47.915 --> 00:50.184
It's all a little obvious,
isn't it? I mean, I--

00:50.284 --> 00:52.553
I just--I hate to feel
like a stereotype.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.123
Mm--
This is whole milk.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.125
Great.
I just drank whole milk.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.759
Now I'm fat
and I'll never find love.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.634
You're coming.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.769
And stop pretending like
you don't like this movie.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.404
Your mother showed me
those photos.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.540
You know the ones
I'm talking about.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.544
All right,
it'll be fun.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.078
I mean, where--

01:19.213 --> 01:20.514
where else can you see grown men
in floral short shorts

01:20.548 --> 01:21.081
belting out show tunes?

01:21.982 --> 01:27.155
* Do re mi fa so la ti do
So do *

01:27.255 --> 01:30.158
[upbeat jazzy music]

01:30.258 --> 01:34.428
*

01:39.500 --> 01:41.702
Do you think people
can tell I'm Maria

01:41.802 --> 01:43.704
even though I don't have
my Captain Von Trapp?

01:43.804 --> 01:48.176
Of course, honey.
You make a perfect Maria.

01:48.276 --> 01:49.310
You're sweet and perky,

01:50.244 --> 01:51.812
and you're obviously
not cut out to be a nun.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.117
'Cause you're a whore.

02:03.891 --> 02:04.858
Thanks, Karen.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.194
And a Jew...

02:06.294 --> 02:07.228
Yeah, I got it.

02:10.231 --> 02:13.133
Oh!
Oh, how cute, look!

02:13.234 --> 02:17.338
"Girls in white dresses
with blue satin sashes."

02:17.438 --> 02:19.573
Yeah, I don't think
those are girls.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.378
You know, as much fun
as this is,

02:24.478 --> 02:26.547
I think I'm gonna go
get a drink.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.149
Actually, more like
16 going on 17.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.854
Mm-mm-mm-mm,
mm-mm-mm.
Hmm?

02:33.954 --> 02:36.590
What is that vision in brown
at the candy counter?

02:36.690 --> 02:38.158
(Grace)
Oh, I know.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.261
Doesn't that Hershey bar
look delicious?

02:41.929 --> 02:44.565
I'm talking about
the cute guy, not candy.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.234
[blows raspberry]
Later, hosen.

02:58.446 --> 03:01.749
Here you go.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.217
What am I supposed to do
with this?

03:03.317 --> 03:05.719
Well, you're supposed
to, uh, tear it in two,

03:05.819 --> 03:07.255
give me one half,

03:07.355 --> 03:08.889
and I guess keep the other half
for your...

03:08.989 --> 03:11.325
big theater scrapbook.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.562
I'm not an usher.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.964
Well, then why are you dressed
like an usher?

03:17.064 --> 03:19.367
I'm not.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.468
I'm Captain Von Trapp.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.237
I have seven singing children,

03:23.337 --> 03:25.072
and my cold heart was recently
melted by a young nun.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.312
Where do you think you are?

03:33.947 --> 03:35.983
Uh, at the Sound of Music
sing-along.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.418
Where do you think you are?

03:38.452 --> 03:41.555
At the 7:40 showing
of Memoirs of a Geisha.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.724
Ooh.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.793
I think you're
in the wrong place.

03:45.893 --> 03:49.430
If this isn't the theater
showing Memoirs of a Geisha,

03:49.530 --> 03:53.667
then why are all these people
coming out, going "eh"?

03:55.669 --> 03:58.672
[cell phone rings]

03:58.772 --> 03:59.673
Hey.

03:59.773 --> 04:00.774
Where are you?

04:00.874 --> 04:02.376
(Will)
Where are you?

04:02.476 --> 04:03.377
I'm--I'm right by the door.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.745
I'm by the door.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.514
I don't see you. Are you
at the entrance at 39th?

04:06.614 --> 04:08.015
39th?

04:08.115 --> 04:11.352
I thought you said
3rd and 9th.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.853
Ugh.
That is the last time

04:12.953 --> 04:16.624
I let you give me directions
while you're eating a muffin.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.392
Well, get here
as fast as you can.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.393
I'm all dressed up
as Maria.

04:20.193 --> 04:27.601
I look like an idiot
without you.

04:27.635 --> 04:32.306
While I, in a Viennese
captain's uniform...

04:32.406 --> 04:36.510
fit right in at the 7:40 showing
of Memoirs of a Geisha.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.447
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.316
39th Street.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.751
That's fa.

04:43.851 --> 04:47.621
Sounds like you've got
a long, long way to run.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.294
I guess I'm the one that looks
like a complete fool.

04:54.395 --> 04:57.465
Oh, don't feel too bad.
My shoes don't match my belt.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.933
[laughs]

05:01.369 --> 05:03.036
Actually, they do.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.709
Huh. Can't believe
I'm in the wrong theater.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.743
Well...

05:09.843 --> 05:11.545
Maybe you're not.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.418
(Jack)
So...

05:17.518 --> 05:19.387
tell me something,
peanut brittle.

05:22.055 --> 05:25.459
If we were boyfriends,

05:25.559 --> 05:30.364
would I be able to get
free nachos?

05:30.464 --> 05:32.099
Yes.
Would you like some free nachos?

05:32.199 --> 05:33.667
Oh, no, I couldn't.
I'm watching your figure.

05:33.767 --> 05:37.371
[both laughing]

05:37.471 --> 05:40.107
I was just in the bathroom,
and what do you know?

05:40.207 --> 05:43.043
I just scored a few
of my favorite things.

05:47.615 --> 05:48.749
It's official.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.451
Ralph and I are in love.
Aw.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.585
His butter might be fake,

05:51.685 --> 05:53.053
but his feelings for me
are very real.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.426
All right, I have
to wait for Will.

05:58.526 --> 06:02.563
You go and save seats
in the front row of the balcony.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.732
I brought marionettes
to dangle over the orchestra

06:04.832 --> 06:07.401
during Lonely Goatherd.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.436
Oh, honey.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.471
If you put even half
this much energy

06:10.571 --> 06:12.640
into finding a man...

06:12.740 --> 06:14.575
Yeah, it probably
still wouldn't work.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.780
I'm double-parked. Can you keep
an eye on them for a second?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.415
Uh, no, not really--
Thank you.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.616
I--ha--hey--

06:22.716 --> 06:25.018
What do I look like?
Some kind of nanny?

06:33.561 --> 06:35.028
So what is it about
The Sound of Music

06:35.128 --> 06:36.864
that makes otherwise
reasonable people

06:36.964 --> 06:38.966
dress up and act
like lunatics?

06:39.066 --> 06:40.167
[laughing]

06:40.267 --> 06:41.502
You're asking
the wrong person.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.570
I'm just going
for my friends.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.404
Yeah, I'm not really a fan.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.740
I think the whole movie's kinda
dopey and sentimental.
Oh, really?

06:46.840 --> 06:49.543
'Cause I love it.
Oh, thank God,
'cause I love it too.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.546
I know the lyrics
to every song.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.081
And the last time
I was hiking,

06:54.181 --> 06:55.182
a helicopter flew over,

06:56.083 --> 06:57.885
and I twirled and twirled
till I threw up.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.589
Wow, I, uh...

07:01.689 --> 07:03.557
I guess I just like it then.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.827
[cell phone rings]

07:06.927 --> 07:08.562
Excuse me.

07:08.662 --> 07:09.563
Hello.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.431
(Grace)
Where are you?

07:11.532 --> 07:13.567
I think I met someone.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.902
I don't see
how that's possible,

07:16.036 --> 07:18.038
because every gay man
in the city is in this theater.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.573
So much lisping going on,

07:19.673 --> 07:22.075
it sounds like someone
poked a hole in the lobby.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.846
Just have to run
off to the bathroom.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.581
Do you mind if they sit
with you and your girls?

07:27.681 --> 07:28.682
No, they're not my--
Thanks.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.151
Oh, this sucks!

07:34.555 --> 07:35.455
Just hurry up!

07:35.556 --> 07:37.457
All right.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.692
Sorry.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.494
Problem with Maria.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.762
I see.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.064
How do you solve
a problem like Maria?

07:44.164 --> 07:46.667
[both laughing]

07:46.767 --> 07:48.936
How do you catch a cloud
and pin it down?

07:50.303 --> 07:51.605
I'm done with those.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.807
Yeah, me too.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.809
Hey, I bought us
some sodas.

07:55.909 --> 07:56.810
Mm.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.547
And Ralph gave me fireballs.

07:59.647 --> 08:02.583
Try not to itch, honey.
It only makes 'em worse.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.788
Thank you.

08:07.888 --> 08:08.956
Bahdum.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.926
Ahh, just the right
amount of soda.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.495
You brought liquor
into a movie theater?

08:15.596 --> 08:18.131
That is so classy.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.236
Well, everything I do has
a touch of class, Jackie.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.875
You hit someone.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.042
Wh--

08:29.142 --> 08:30.143
Oh, he's okay, though.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.513
But his wife is complaining
to an usher.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.148
She's really steamed.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.584
Which I guess is appropriate

08:37.618 --> 08:39.086
since she's dressed
as a bright copper kettle.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.588
Crap.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.857
I had to hit one of
the six straight people here.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.158
They're so litigious.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.661
They're all like,
"Oh, I got hit by a bottle."

08:47.761 --> 08:48.896
You hit a queer,
they're like,

08:49.930 --> 08:52.299
"Did I just get hit by a bottle?
Eh, all in a day."

08:53.333 --> 08:56.136
Karen, that is an ugly
and offensive remark

08:56.236 --> 08:57.705
which has no basis
in reality.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.542
Eh, all in a day.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.078
(male announcer)
We'll be holding the film

09:05.178 --> 09:06.313
until we find the person

09:07.414 --> 09:08.281
who threw an object
from the balcony.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.584
I don't care.
Hold it.

09:10.684 --> 09:11.819
If you have any information

09:12.986 --> 09:14.321
as to this person's identity
or whereabouts,

09:15.422 --> 09:16.657
please report to an usher
immediately.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.159
Big deal.
Like, what are they gonna do?

09:19.259 --> 09:21.629
What we're going to do...

09:21.729 --> 09:23.931
is call the police
and have them arrest

09:24.031 --> 09:24.965
the guilty party.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.266
[whispering]
Oh, my God.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.601
Karen, we gotta
get out of here.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.069
Hold on, hold on.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.671
Do you have any leads?

09:34.675 --> 09:36.343
I guess he went on break.
Ugh!

09:44.384 --> 09:51.591
[both whistling]

09:51.692 --> 09:52.826
Okay, let's make
a run for it.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.027
Honey, we can't.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.263
My name was
on that flask.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.898
You put your name
on the flask?

09:57.998 --> 09:59.833
Yeah, it says "Karen Walker,
Bikini Inspector."

09:59.933 --> 10:01.068
I got it on spring break.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.037
I hardly saw you that trip.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.006
You were so into your Rich Woman
Gone Wild shoot.
I know.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.377
Okay, so you go back
in the theater

10:10.477 --> 10:11.611
and try to find it.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.113
I'll see if Ralph
has heard anything.

10:13.146 --> 10:13.747
Okay.
Okay.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.617
[Karen whistling]

10:19.720 --> 10:20.353
Hello, Ralph.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.889
Listen, I heard

10:21.989 --> 10:24.758
somebody threw a flask
over the balcony.

10:24.858 --> 10:25.993
Any idea who that was?

10:26.093 --> 10:27.795
How did you know
it was a flask?

10:27.895 --> 10:29.062
I didn't.
You just said it was.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.765
Oh, that's right.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.333
Well, they still don't know
who did it.

10:33.433 --> 10:34.367
You didn't see anything,
did you?

10:35.202 --> 10:38.405
No, once Karen threw it,
I just ran.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.307
Right, well, if you hear
anything, let me know.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.715
Oh, great.
Child care.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.952
Child? Yes.
Care?

10:56.489 --> 11:00.660
Oh, I can't believe
I'm missing this movie.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.096
Where the hell is Will?

11:03.196 --> 11:04.097
We don't know.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.133
So please stop asking.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.105
You know what?
You're right.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.373
I apologize to you.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.443
And you.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.678
* And yuh and yuh and yuh *

11:21.014 --> 11:22.049
Oh...

11:22.149 --> 11:27.454
If you were gay,
you'd be rolling.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.122
Why?

11:29.222 --> 11:31.024
Is that from the movie?

11:31.124 --> 11:32.860
Well, yeah, it's from--

11:32.960 --> 11:35.195
Have you--have you
never seen this?

11:35.295 --> 11:37.197
It's--it's a--

11:37.297 --> 11:39.099
It's just
the best movie ever!

11:39.199 --> 11:42.069
What kind of parents
do you have?

11:42.169 --> 11:43.103
Well...

11:43.203 --> 11:44.704
they left me here
with you.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.377
So you don't know
any of the songs?

11:50.477 --> 11:53.080
Okay now.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.315
I am now starting to think

11:55.415 --> 11:57.818
that I was sent to you children
for a reason.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.095
I'm going to teach you.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.296
[sighs]

12:09.396 --> 12:11.331
But where to start.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.970
Ah.

12:17.070 --> 12:22.242
[singing loudly and off-key]
* Let's start
at the very beginning *

12:22.342 --> 12:26.479
* A very good place
to start-- *

12:26.579 --> 12:29.449
Is this how it sounds
in the movie?

12:32.452 --> 12:33.453
Kinda.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.224
Her voice was warbly sometimes.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.326
Mine's a little more pure.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.095
* When you read,
you begin with-- *

12:42.195 --> 12:45.332
[whispering]
Grace, Grace, Grace.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.534
Karen threw a flask
over the balcony,

12:47.634 --> 12:49.402
and they're gonna hold the movie
till they find her.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.504
On the plus side, Ralph and I
had our first kiss,

12:51.604 --> 12:53.506
and his lips taste
like Sno-Caps.

12:56.543 --> 13:00.013
So, James, you're seeing
Memoirs of a Geisha,

13:00.113 --> 13:01.548
alone on a Saturday night.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.517
No matter what anybody says,
I don't think that's sad.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.854
[laughing]

13:06.954 --> 13:10.357
I agree--sad would be showing up
dressed up in a kimono.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.829
Unless that's what you're
planning to wear

13:15.929 --> 13:16.830
when you see it.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.199
Which would be cool.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.836
No, that'd be crazy.

13:22.936 --> 13:23.837
It's January.

13:23.937 --> 13:24.838
You know how hard it is

13:25.638 --> 13:26.974
to get sidewalk salt
out of raw silk?

13:28.909 --> 13:30.944
I feel I need to say this.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.847
I'm not a drag queen.
You know that, right?

13:35.348 --> 13:37.017
[cell phone ringing]
Mm, sorry.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.887
I guess Maria's got a lot
of rollover minutes, huh?

13:41.922 --> 13:42.890
Hello.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.524
Where are you?

13:44.624 --> 13:47.060
Oh, I--I'm--
I'm on the train.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.162
Yeah, it doesn't sound
like you're on the train.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.197
Well, I am.

13:50.297 --> 13:53.233
[makes whooshing sound]

13:55.435 --> 13:56.436
Don't you fake train to me.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.605
I taught you fake train.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.041
I taught you fake train.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.576
That's fake train?

14:03.676 --> 14:06.279
Sounded more like
fake dishwasher.

14:06.379 --> 14:10.417
When would you ever need
fake dishwasher?

14:11.651 --> 14:12.619
(Grace)
Hey.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.287
Listen to me.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.588
Karen's in trouble.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.226
She threw a flask over
the balcony and hit someone.

14:19.259 --> 14:19.993
If they catch her, they're
gonna press charges.

14:20.027 --> 14:20.260
Get over here.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.129
I--
[sighs]

14:22.229 --> 14:24.331
I'm sorry, I got--

14:24.431 --> 14:25.598
That's all right, I heard.
It's cool.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.367
My movie started
ten minutes ago anyway.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.002
Oh, no, you're missing
the previews.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.870
Yeah, and they're
my favorite part.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.940
Me too.
Go.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.441
Uh, listen, this was fun.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.443
Yeah, it was.
I'm glad we, uh--

14:36.543 --> 14:37.577
Me too.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.479
Okay.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.614
Bye.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.051
Bye-bye.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.300
Oh, my goodness.
Finally.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.969
What happened?

15:02.069 --> 15:02.970
I'm sorry.

15:03.070 --> 15:03.603
I--I just, I--

15:03.703 --> 15:04.904
Wow, I didn't realize

15:05.805 --> 15:07.941
your costume would be
this elaborate.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.979
Where--where is Karen?

15:12.079 --> 15:13.280
I have no idea.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.116
Shh!
There is no Karen.

15:22.990 --> 15:26.593
I'm Sister Francis
Beaverhausen.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.364
Well, I got there too late.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.000
One of those ushers had already
taken my flask

15:33.100 --> 15:34.134
to the manager's office!

15:35.068 --> 15:36.703
Calm down, I'll go talk
to the manager.

15:36.736 --> 15:37.537
I'm sure we can work
something out.

15:37.637 --> 15:38.671
I'm surprised you can
wear that thing

15:38.771 --> 15:40.673
without your skin burning.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.646
I feel scared.
Me too.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.348
Me too.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.018
Aw, sweetie, come here.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.022
Everyone, gather 'round.

16:00.760 --> 16:04.998
You know what I do
when I feel scared?

16:05.098 --> 16:07.067
Fart a little
and then deny it?

16:13.040 --> 16:15.975
No.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.010
Well, after that.

16:19.246 --> 16:24.117
I try to think of some
of my favorite things.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.086
Like...

16:26.186 --> 16:31.058
* Rain drops on roses
and whiskers on kittens *

16:31.158 --> 16:35.162
* And then I don't feel

16:35.262 --> 16:40.300
* So bad *

16:42.835 --> 16:45.072
Oh, thank God.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.139
* Cream colored-- *

16:46.239 --> 16:48.007
Oh, enough!

16:50.277 --> 16:52.179
Will, what happened?
That manager was such a jerk.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.013
He wouldn't listen
to reason.

16:54.114 --> 16:54.714
So I threw some paperclips
in his face,

16:54.814 --> 16:56.015
and I grabbed the flask.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.186
Thank God.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.054
Ugh.
Empty!

17:01.154 --> 17:02.089
Karen!
Ugh!

17:03.290 --> 17:04.724
Damn it!

17:04.824 --> 17:07.026
We gotta get outta here.
They're after all of us now.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.027
Why me?

17:08.128 --> 17:09.529
They heard you singing.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.567
We can't get out.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.036
They've posted ushers
at every door.

17:17.137 --> 17:20.773
Trained movie
theater ushers.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.810
We're Von Trapped.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.082
I know--I'll find Ralph.
He'll help us.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.783
No!
We can't trust him.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.053
Can we?
Who is he?

17:34.154 --> 17:36.423
Well, then who
can we trust?

17:36.523 --> 17:38.358
What about me, lady?

17:41.661 --> 17:44.164
Rosie, what are you doing here?

17:44.264 --> 17:45.165
I wouldn't miss it.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.299
I played Gretl

17:47.234 --> 17:50.170
in the El Salvador
first national production.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.105
Oh, Ro-Ro,

17:52.205 --> 17:55.342
I woulda paid
six chickens to see that.

17:55.442 --> 17:59.246
It was an equity theater,
you racist bitch.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.513
Now, quick,

18:00.613 --> 18:03.082
hide in there before
I change my mind, come on.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.151
I--I--

18:05.017 --> 18:07.687
Well, I--I at least have
to say good-bye.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.822
* So long, farewell-- *

18:09.922 --> 18:12.425
[all screaming]

18:18.431 --> 18:19.399
Weirdly,

18:19.499 --> 18:20.700
this is not the first time

18:20.800 --> 18:23.170
a nun has urged me
to stay in a closet.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.841
How long are we supposed
to stay in this filthy--

18:28.941 --> 18:30.577
Oh, hey, I got time.

18:33.613 --> 18:37.184
Okay, who's the guy?

18:37.284 --> 18:38.151
Are you gonna see him again?

18:38.251 --> 18:39.852
Doubt it.

18:39.952 --> 18:40.820
All I know is
his name is James.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.589
I didn't even get
a phone number.

18:42.689 --> 18:43.590
Why not?

18:43.690 --> 18:44.791
I don't know.
I--I--

18:44.891 --> 18:47.160
You called,
his movie was starting...

18:47.260 --> 18:48.161
Just didn't happen.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.463
So you chickened out.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.699
Pretty much.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.367
I don't know, I just--

18:54.467 --> 18:56.336
I guess I couldn't face...

18:56.436 --> 18:57.670
What, Will?

18:57.770 --> 18:59.506
[British accent]
What is it you can't face?

19:05.845 --> 19:08.415
I don't know.
I guess I just...

19:08.515 --> 19:09.682
Didn't want to seem desperate.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.419
I didn't want him to think I was
making more of it than it was.

19:12.519 --> 19:16.223
Will, if he was talking
to you,

19:16.323 --> 19:18.157
then he must be desperate too.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.666
As soon as we
get out of here,

19:26.766 --> 19:28.167
you've gotta go back to the
theater, you've gotta find him.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.902
No, it was just a drink.
And--and--and it--

19:30.002 --> 19:31.838
It probably did mean more to me
than it did to him.

19:31.938 --> 19:32.839
(Jack)
Shh!

19:32.939 --> 19:33.873
I hear something.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.259
Oh, thank God, Ralph.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.961
Wait, wait, wait.

20:01.768 --> 20:02.902
Don't do it, Ralph.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.506
You're not one of them.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.510
Come on.
Go out the back way.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.220
[whistle trilling]

20:21.321 --> 20:22.188
They're here!

20:22.289 --> 20:24.223
You're an usher.
Why do you have a whistle?

20:24.324 --> 20:25.958
I also coach soccer.

20:31.698 --> 20:32.765
Captain,

20:32.865 --> 20:34.767
I was hoping
I'd find you.

20:34.867 --> 20:35.802
Ooh, I'm sorry.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.304
I, uh--

20:37.404 --> 20:38.371
I thought you
were somebody else.

20:40.907 --> 20:40.973
What the--
Eh, all in a day.
