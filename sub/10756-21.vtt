FRASIER: Morning, Sherry.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.796
- Coffee's on. Want a cuppa?
FRASIER: No, thank you.

00:16.056 --> 00:19.891
Caffeine only weakens the immune
system. I'm fighting off a flu.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.022
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me get you some breakfast.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.944
- That's really not necessary.
SHERRY: No.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.782
You'll feel much better
once you've had

00:26.026 --> 00:28.824
my scrambled-egg tacos
and Spam patties.

00:30.572 --> 00:34.690
In keeping with the trusty adage:
"Starve a cold, disgust a fever."

00:35.493 --> 00:37.882
- Tea and dry toast?
- Oh, bless you.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.269
- Oh, honey, I was using that.
- Oh, sorry.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.377
Well, no problem.

00:48.673 --> 00:51.790
Listen, why don't you just relax.
I'll clean up later.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.574
You know, not to criticize,

00:54.846 --> 00:58.282
but I usually serve Mr Crane
whole-grain cereal for breakfast.

00:58.641 --> 01:02.190
- I try to avoid giving him fried foods.
- Oh, Marty loves fried foods.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.553
Yes, well, just because
he likes something

01:04.813 --> 01:06.327
doesn't mean it's good for him.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.997
True. But just because
something's good for him

01:09.277 --> 01:13.111
doesn't mean that he has to be
stuck with it day after day.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.960
Oh, looks like it's gonna be
another scorcher.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.639

01:22.290 --> 01:23.769
- Yes, it's hot.
- Yeah.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.594
Well, I guess there'll be
some more brownouts.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.709
Hate to think what
it's gonna do to the crops.

01:28.963 --> 01:32.797
- Dad, please, I'm trying to read.
- Oh, sure. Sorry. Yeah.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.111
Oh, double homicide last night.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.990
Yeah, with this heat wave,
though, I'm not surprised.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.661
Yeah, wonder what started that.

01:41.893 --> 01:45.442
Perhaps someone wouldn't stop
talking about the weather.

01:46.398 --> 01:49.276
Hey, you might be right.
It's a real scorcher out there.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.632
- Morning, handsome.
MARTIN: Oh, hey, hey.

01:53.905 --> 01:55.463
Did I say that before?

01:55.740 --> 01:57.935
Before and after.

Please, would you two spare me
the single entendre this morning?

02:03.665 --> 02:04.939
I'm trying to avoid getting sick.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.600
Well, there's nothing like
one of mama's big biscuits

02:07.877 --> 02:09.595
if you're fighting something off.

02:09.878 --> 02:13.792
Yes. I'm sure with good aim,
it could bring down an elk.

02:14.175 --> 02:16.166
- How about you, sweetie?
- Just half of one for me.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.225
Oh, come on.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.708
It wouldn't hurt you
to put on a few pounds.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.972
Men like to see a little
oomph in your walk-away.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.740
Yeah, you ought to see them smile
when Sherry leaves the room.

Now, you're so pretty.

FRASIER: Just stop right there.

I'm trying to have a peaceful morning.
I do not want to be put on the spot,

02:50.503 --> 02:52.414
and I do not want to eat
some bizarre concoction,

02:52.672 --> 02:54.902
and I do not want to discuss
the weather.

at the last company wedding,

04:42.973 --> 04:46.568
hip-checked you into the ice sculpture in
a headlong rush to catch the bouquet?

04:46.893 --> 04:48.611
That is not what happened.

04:48.854 --> 04:52.051
She thought the bartender said,
"Last call."

Look, Roz, I'm not gonna fight
anymore, but I want you to know

04:57.446 --> 04:59.516
you said a lot of things

12:34.343 --> 12:36.538
Don't you just love the feel
of silk on your skin?

12:36.804 --> 12:39.079
Oh, yes, there's nothing quite like it.

12:40.015 --> 12:41.846
Passion fruit?

12:42.976 --> 12:44.534
- Thank you.
- Here you are.

12:44.770 --> 12:47.603
You know, if you keep treating me
like this, I'll never want to leave.

12:48.857 --> 12:51.132
Champagne?

12:51.443 --> 12:53.001
You shouldn't have.

12:53.529 --> 12:55.679
I love champagne, but it's--
It's a drink for two,

12:55.948 --> 12:58.178
and I never have anyone
to share it with.

12:58.450 --> 13:01.886
Yes, there are things you miss
when you're on your own.

13:02.246 --> 13:03.565
Champagne.

13:03.789 --> 13:05.859
Another person's touch.

13:06.124 --> 13:08.240
Even if it's just holding hands.

13:11.255 --> 13:13.246
I guess you've been missing
that sort of thing too,

13:13.507 --> 13:15.145
since you and Mrs Crane split up.

13:15.425 --> 13:16.699
Actually, Maris never held hands.

13:16.927 --> 13:19.919
She had a slight webbing.
It made her self-conscious.

13:24.309 --> 13:26.186
DAPHNE:
Well...

13:26.478 --> 13:28.946
...I'm sure there are other
intimacies you miss.

13:30.274 --> 13:32.310
Well, naturally,

13:32.568 --> 13:34.081
I still have a longing for...

13:35.445 --> 13:38.357
- That is, I have a desire to have...
- Sex?

13:38.657 --> 13:40.454
- Fruit?
- Pardon?

13:40.909 --> 13:43.582
- I mean, yes, sex.
- I'd love some.

13:44.746 --> 13:46.782
- I mean fruit.
- Fruit, yes.

13:48.417 --> 13:52.171
- Although sex is good too.
- Oh, well...

13:56.592 --> 13:57.707
I'm sorry, Dr Crane.

13:57.926 --> 14:01.521
I guess I just have sex
on the mind tonight.

14:01.847 --> 14:03.166
NILES:
Well...

14:04.850 --> 14:06.602
Well, that happens.

14:07.978 --> 14:10.446
This weather doesn't help, does it?

14:12.232 --> 14:14.746
The heat gets inside you.

14:15.068 --> 14:17.662
It makes you so aware of your body.

14:20.407 --> 14:22.363
It's like nature's way...

14:22.618 --> 14:24.768
...of letting you know
you're still an animal.

14:30.167 --> 14:32.203
God, it's hot in here.

14:35.506 --> 14:38.066
- Getting hotter every minute.
- Ice?

14:38.342 --> 14:41.300
Oh, yes, I could use some right now.

14:44.014 --> 14:45.606
Oh, yes.

14:46.099 --> 14:47.771
That is better.

14:50.229 --> 14:51.867
Where's your piece?

14:55.609 --> 14:56.962
Melted.

14:57.486 --> 14:59.317
I'll get another.

15:03.951 --> 15:05.589
You know, unless it cools down,

15:05.828 --> 15:08.501
I'm afraid we won't be getting
much sleep tonight.

15:12.042 --> 15:14.715
Shame we have just the one fan.

15:15.212 --> 15:17.328
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

15:17.714 --> 15:19.830
Yes, that is a shame.

15:20.092 --> 15:23.562
The two of us and just one fan.

15:24.721 --> 15:26.757
Well, of course, you're the host.
You take it.

15:27.015 --> 15:28.573
No, no, no. I couldn't sleep at all

15:28.809 --> 15:32.438
knowing you were
in the next room all hot and...

15:33.355 --> 15:35.232
...hot.

15:36.859 --> 15:38.087
Well,

15:38.318 --> 15:41.628
I suppose under the circumstances,

15:41.947 --> 15:44.745
we could both sleep
in the same room.

15:46.660 --> 15:48.252
It does...

15:48.495 --> 15:50.247
...oscillate.

15:53.959 --> 15:57.190
- What?
- The fan.

16:02.050 --> 16:04.041
- Oh, dear.
- What?

16:04.303 --> 16:06.294
It's time to take my pills.
I forgot all about them.

16:06.555 --> 16:08.989
- They're back at the apartment.
- What pills?

16:09.266 --> 16:12.656
It's my thyroid. Nothing serious,
just a bit overactive.

16:12.978 --> 16:15.617
If I don't take my pills,
I tend to faint dead away.

16:15.939 --> 16:18.817
What's the point of having
a fainting couch if you can't use it?

16:19.151 --> 16:21.346
I'll just run over and get them.
I'll come right back.

16:21.612 --> 16:23.045
No.

16:23.322 --> 16:25.040
We'll go together,
and I'll run up for you.

16:25.282 --> 16:28.319
If you and Sherry get in
the same room you might make up...

16:28.619 --> 16:31.053
...more reasons to fight
with one another.

16:42.299 --> 16:44.335
MARTIN:
Well, you did the best you could.

16:44.593 --> 16:47.505
SHERRY: I know, but I suppose l
shouldn't have gotten on her so hard.

16:47.846 --> 16:50.121
MARTIN: She's trying to do stuff here.
SHERRY: I know.

16:50.474 --> 16:53.272
MARTIN: It's true. That's right too.
We don't have much privacy either.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.835
SHERRY: But I think Kenny
is the perfect person.

16:56.104 --> 16:57.457

Kenny would be great.

SHERRY:
Don't you think so? Nilesie!

17:00.651 --> 17:03.643
- Where did you come from?
- What're you doing here?

17:03.946 --> 17:06.779
Daphne's taking refuge at my apartment
for the night. I just stopped by

17:07.074 --> 17:09.383
- to get a few of her things.
- Back.

17:09.701 --> 17:11.339
You were just gonna
let us worry all night?

17:11.578 --> 17:14.092
- I was gonna tell you on my way out.
MARTIN: This is stupid.

17:14.373 --> 17:16.762
I'm gonna call her and get her
back here. We'll work this out.

17:17.041 --> 17:19.032
It's a waste of time.
She's so upset, there's no way

17:19.294 --> 17:21.329
she will ever set foot
in this apartment tonight.

17:22.548 --> 17:25.460
If you don't believe me,
you can ask her yourself.

17:27.261 --> 17:30.537
I just remembered, my pills aren't
in the cabinet. They're on the dresser.

17:30.889 --> 17:33.357
What courage, pulling yourself
together. Just scurry to the car,

17:33.642 --> 17:34.757
I'll only be a moment.

17:35.018 --> 17:36.656
MARTIN:
Daphne.

17:36.895 --> 17:39.728
Sherry and I talked,
and we really feel bad about this.

17:40.065 --> 17:41.896
The whole thing is just
a misunderstanding.

17:42.192 --> 17:45.867
If you want, I suppose we could
sit down and talk it out.

17:46.738 --> 17:49.093
Well, I suppose we could.

17:49.408 --> 17:52.605
NILES: Obviously, these two
wildcats can't come to terms.

17:53.620 --> 17:55.292
The best thing will be
for them to be apart.

17:55.539 --> 17:57.450
- I know. I'm a psychiatrist.
SHERRY: No, no, no.

17:57.749 --> 18:01.059
Your dad is right.
Now, Daphne just misunderstood.

18:01.712 --> 18:03.828
I didn't exactly misunderstand.

18:04.089 --> 18:06.319
You did set me up
with a total stranger.

18:06.633 --> 18:09.386
Oh, but he's not a stranger.
He comes in the bar all the time.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.517
Oh, a barfly. Much better.

18:11.805 --> 18:14.080
- Oh, there you go again.
- Me?!

18:14.349 --> 18:16.260
You know, you two
are really a lot alike.

18:16.518 --> 18:18.349
SHERRY: No, we're not!
- I am not like her!

18:18.604 --> 18:21.323
SHERRY: How can you say that?
NILES: Talk amongst yourselves.

18:21.607 --> 18:23.757

I mean, all I was trying to do...

18:24.026 --> 18:26.540
- He's probably an alcoholic!
- He is not an alcoholic.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.190
I'm taking a bath.

18:38.749 --> 18:40.626
Bubbles?

18:40.876 --> 18:42.673
They're aroma-therapeutic.

18:42.961 --> 18:44.952
And exactly what part of
"I'm taking a bath"

18:45.214 --> 18:47.444
did you take to mean "Come on in"?

18:47.758 --> 18:50.352
Well, I'm sorry to tax your
delicate system, but Daphne's back,

18:50.636 --> 18:52.433
and she and Sherry are at again,

18:52.679 --> 18:54.795
and now she says she's gonna stay
overnight with Niles,

18:55.057 --> 18:56.285
and this is your department.

18:56.517 --> 18:59.315
Unless blood has been spilled,
and on a carpeted area, I don't care.

18:59.603 --> 19:01.241
- Now get out.
SHERRY: Oh, there you are.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.268
Marty, I tried, but that girl
has no manners whatsoever.

19:05.609 --> 19:07.327
- Hey, Frasier.
- Do you mind?!

19:07.611 --> 19:09.010
I knew I'd find you in here.

19:09.279 --> 19:11.156
Whatever they're telling you,
it's not true.

19:11.406 --> 19:14.045
- Daphne, you can't come in here.
- Why not? She can.

19:14.368 --> 19:15.767
No, she can't! No one can!

19:16.036 --> 19:17.788
Frasier, have you no decency?
Daphne, let's go.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.958
All right, I am moments away from
succumbing once and for all to this flu,

19:21.291 --> 19:25.409
but I will take one stab at this, and then
I am going to sink hippopotamus-like

19:25.754 --> 19:27.107
beneath the bubbles.

19:28.173 --> 19:31.529
I think what this all comes down to
is a dispute over turf.

19:31.844 --> 19:34.563
Daphne and Sherry are like two
animals scent-marking their territory,

19:34.847 --> 19:36.041

disgusting comparison?

Emperor Tiberius.

19:53.657 --> 19:56.569
Sherry, you also enjoy
taking care of Dad.

19:56.869 --> 20:00.782
I suspect that your attempts to find
Daphne a boyfriend are really

20:01.123 --> 20:02.875
an unconscious ploy
to get her out of the way.

20:03.125 --> 20:04.274
It's unconscious.

no longer needed.

anything tonight, all right?

20:23.312 --> 20:27.146
I think we now all understand why you
stormed out of here earlier.

20:27.524 --> 20:30.960
A strong emotion like not feeling
wanted can drive anyone to a rash

20:31.278 --> 20:32.552
