15:43.162 --> 15:45.661
He's a very laid back guy.

15:54.614 --> 15:56.872
I'll cancel with Deirdre.

15:57.082 --> 15:59.818
- No, that's not what I was...
- No, I know.

15:59.819 --> 16:01.527
But you don't have to.

16:01.552 --> 16:03.087
I know.

16:04.435 --> 16:06.330
I'll tell her it's work.

16:06.355 --> 16:08.552
She understands "work."

16:23.909 --> 16:25.576
(door creaks)

16:25.577 --> 16:27.954
(woman speaking
indistinctly in distance)

16:35.420 --> 16:37.922
There was a man back there.

16:37.923 --> 16:39.238
He was one of ours.

16:39.263 --> 16:41.707
We have people watching to make
sure you haven't been followed.

16:41.732 --> 16:42.792
You're safe.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.995
Try not to look over your shoulder.

16:44.996 --> 16:46.731
You don't want to draw attention.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.242
Was I doing that? I was just checking...

16:49.267 --> 16:51.668
You just shouldn't look worried.

16:51.669 --> 16:53.437
But I am.

16:53.438 --> 16:54.936
I know.

17:00.739 --> 17:03.580
And my son has a big imagination.

17:03.581 --> 17:04.781
Hmm.

17:04.781 --> 17:08.416
One day he wants to be captain.

17:08.417 --> 17:11.606
The next day a fireman.

17:12.422 --> 17:15.257
Next day police.

17:15.258 --> 17:17.005
A doctor.

17:17.455 --> 17:19.057
(sighs)

17:19.082 --> 17:22.098
I want him to be what he wants.

17:22.098 --> 17:24.500
He can be whatever he wants here.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.287
With the money we give you,
you can save for his education.

17:27.311 --> 17:29.838
We'll give you five
hundred dollars a month.

17:29.839 --> 17:31.699
We'll put two fifty of that

17:31.724 --> 17:33.724
into a college trust fund for your son.

17:33.749 --> 17:37.820
And, if things go well,
we'll give you more.

17:38.314 --> 17:42.271
And I can save half for college,

17:42.296 --> 17:44.835
half for house.

17:45.343 --> 17:49.457
Well, saving for a house
will take a very long time.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.859
But I won't use that money

17:51.860 --> 17:54.629
for nothing other than those things.

17:54.630 --> 17:57.997
Just son and house.

17:59.035 --> 18:01.968
So, how are things going at work?

18:01.993 --> 18:04.439
Fine. Usual.

18:04.440 --> 18:07.102
You get along with your coworkers?

18:07.643 --> 18:09.702
Most of them.

18:09.727 --> 18:11.979
You know, I don't say so much

18:11.980 --> 18:15.016
because everyone is gossip.

18:16.212 --> 18:18.446
There is very little room.

18:18.447 --> 18:21.258
And everyone's desks so close,

18:21.283 --> 18:24.001
so everyone...

18:24.026 --> 18:28.743
hear everything, see everything...

18:28.990 --> 18:31.259
- everyone smell everything.
- Hmm.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.717
But we get along. Yes.

18:34.742 --> 18:36.530
We like each other.

18:36.531 --> 18:38.408
Except of Yuri,

18:38.433 --> 18:41.915
the GRU officer.

18:41.940 --> 18:43.908
Nobody likes him.

18:43.933 --> 18:45.132
Yuri?

18:45.157 --> 18:47.158
Yuri Tkachuk.

18:47.183 --> 18:50.543
He thinks he's a big man
and he knows everything

18:50.544 --> 18:52.479
but he know nothing.

18:52.480 --> 18:56.081
Mm. So it's not that
different from the FBI, then?

18:56.183 --> 18:58.285
Do you have a Yuri too?

18:58.286 --> 19:00.644
Every office has a Yuri.

19:00.669 --> 19:03.042
- (chuckles)
- (chuckles)

19:03.480 --> 19:05.091
Where did you tell your coworkers

19:05.092 --> 19:07.178
you were going today?

19:07.528 --> 19:09.881
Mm. Just lunch.

19:09.906 --> 19:12.674
Do they ever ask you
where you went for lunch?

19:12.699 --> 19:15.310
Uh, I guess. Sometimes.

19:15.335 --> 19:20.186
I mean... nobody cares though.

19:20.211 --> 19:23.976
Everybody go out to lunch sometimes.

19:23.977 --> 19:26.350
You need to be able to
tell them where you ate,

19:26.375 --> 19:29.029
what you ate, who you ate with,

19:29.054 --> 19:31.311
and why you picked that place to eat.

19:31.336 --> 19:34.486
But... nobody ask me all of that.

19:34.487 --> 19:36.322
You have to be prepared if they do ask.

19:36.323 --> 19:38.976
You don't want to appear nervous.

19:40.493 --> 19:42.030
Okay.

19:43.593 --> 19:46.022
Where do you usually eat?

19:46.436 --> 19:49.483
I like pizza. At Armand's.

19:49.508 --> 19:51.469
- On Wisconsin?
- Yeah.

19:51.494 --> 19:52.976
Do any of them go there?

19:53.174 --> 19:54.808
No. It's only my place.

19:54.810 --> 19:58.212
But they know that I go there.

19:58.213 --> 20:00.847
So tell them you went
for lunch at Armand's.

20:00.848 --> 20:05.252
But only if they ask, don't offer it up.

20:05.253 --> 20:07.119
Okay.

20:09.890 --> 20:11.525
Um...

20:11.526 --> 20:15.729
I have a favor to ask.

20:15.730 --> 20:17.276
Please.

20:17.502 --> 20:21.101
But I don't know if this is something

20:21.102 --> 20:23.505
you can help me.

20:26.215 --> 20:28.911
We can't tell you unless you ask.

20:30.577 --> 20:31.990
Okay.

20:32.015 --> 20:33.552
Uh...

20:34.505 --> 20:37.683
My teeth... problems.

20:37.684 --> 20:42.490
You know, the dentist
is too expensive here.

20:43.290 --> 20:44.724
(sighs)

20:44.725 --> 20:48.527
So maybe can you help me with dentist?

20:48.552 --> 20:49.818
Yes.

20:49.843 --> 20:51.978
We'll take care of that for you.

20:52.065 --> 20:54.691
(chuckling)

20:54.716 --> 20:57.136
(stammering)

20:57.137 --> 20:59.337
Thank you.

20:59.338 --> 21:01.339
Thank you.

21:01.340 --> 21:03.982
I will do a good job for you.

21:04.007 --> 21:05.306
Yeah.

21:05.331 --> 21:06.954
Can you repeat what you'll tell anyone

21:06.979 --> 21:09.046
who asks where you were?

21:10.716 --> 21:14.405
I went to lunch.

21:15.154 --> 21:17.389
I got my pizza.

21:17.390 --> 21:19.052
At Armand's.

21:19.077 --> 21:20.892
Armand's pizza.

21:20.893 --> 21:22.226
Good.

21:22.336 --> 21:23.616
Good.

21:25.757 --> 21:27.179
Okay.

21:28.700 --> 21:30.835
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:30.836 --> 21:33.437

21:33.438 --> 21:36.439

21:39.278 --> 21:41.345

21:41.346 --> 21:42.546
(click)

21:42.547 --> 21:44.715
- STOBERT: Hello?
- Hi.

21:45.569 --> 21:46.997
Brenda.

21:47.022 --> 21:49.052
(chuckling) I was just
thinking about you.

21:49.053 --> 21:50.921
(scoffs) Sure you were.

21:50.922 --> 21:52.055
(chuckles)

21:52.056 --> 21:53.490
I was. I was.

21:53.491 --> 21:56.726
I'm... I'm always thinking of you.

21:56.727 --> 21:58.561
Well... that's good, I guess.

21:58.562 --> 21:59.937
(chuckles)

21:59.962 --> 22:05.022
Um... listen, I-I can't
come to town next week.

22:05.636 --> 22:07.046
STOBERT: Oh.

22:07.471 --> 22:10.073
Oh, man. I was really
looking forward to seeing you.

22:10.074 --> 22:12.475
- Okay.
- Yeah.

22:12.476 --> 22:15.077
I, uh... I won't be able to get back

22:15.078 --> 22:17.482
for another two or three weeks.

22:17.507 --> 22:18.940
Is everything okay?

22:18.965 --> 22:20.749
Uh... Did I do something wrong?

22:20.750 --> 22:22.217
No. No. No. It's nothing like that.

22:22.218 --> 22:25.220
I'm just busy with
some bullshit at work.

22:25.221 --> 22:27.043
STOBERT: Your work's not bullshit.

22:27.068 --> 22:29.257
It is, kind of. Compared to what you do.

22:29.258 --> 22:31.597
Saving millions of lives.

22:31.622 --> 22:33.256
Not yet.

22:33.562 --> 22:36.769
Yeah, but, I mean, at
least you're trying.

22:37.092 --> 22:39.292
Not everyone can do that.

22:39.434 --> 22:41.474
Not everyone wants to.

22:45.587 --> 22:49.013
So... I'm not going to be
able to make it next week.

22:49.544 --> 22:50.878
DEIRDRE: That's fine.

22:50.879 --> 22:53.494
But I'll, uh... I'll be there soon.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.051
Hello?

22:58.052 --> 22:59.470
I'm here.

22:59.495 --> 23:00.688
It's... I mean, it's just work.

23:00.689 --> 23:04.095
I'm swamped right now and I... uh...

23:04.526 --> 23:06.294
No. I'm not mad.

23:07.036 --> 23:08.630
Listen...

23:09.431 --> 23:12.257
you're a really sweet guy.

23:12.282 --> 23:13.622
But...

23:15.544 --> 23:17.304
But...?

23:17.305 --> 23:19.669
I've been really trying, but...

23:20.427 --> 23:24.599
I just don't see this
going much further.

23:25.880 --> 23:28.100
We're... we're just getting started.

23:28.125 --> 23:30.990
(chuckling) I mean, we...
we... we haven't even...

23:31.015 --> 23:32.654
No. I know.

23:33.153 --> 23:34.826
It's been nice.

23:35.523 --> 23:38.014
I've been having a really nice time,

23:38.928 --> 23:40.428
but...

23:41.938 --> 23:44.076
we're not compatible.

23:45.787 --> 23:47.900
L-Listen, this... this...

23:47.901 --> 23:49.535
Look, can we... can we
talk about this in person?

23:49.536 --> 23:52.104
Like, when I'm in town next?

23:52.129 --> 23:56.162
Because I-I-I think
we can make this work.

23:56.611 --> 23:59.217
I won't change my mind.

23:59.779 --> 24:02.592
You're not right for me and...

24:02.617 --> 24:04.241
I know it.

24:05.162 --> 24:06.452
Why?

24:06.961 --> 24:10.545
Like I said. You're
nice. You're really nice.

24:11.057 --> 24:13.670
But I need someone more...

24:14.293 --> 24:15.860
I don't know...

24:15.861 --> 24:17.498
assertive.

24:21.979 --> 24:24.125
You really are great.

24:29.170 --> 24:31.904
(both grunting, panting)

24:39.383 --> 24:41.195
Do it again. Yeah.

24:43.342 --> 24:45.609
(both grunting, panting)

24:53.042 --> 24:55.165
When am I going to be able
to take care of myself?

24:55.166 --> 24:57.368
You're getting there.
You're getting there.

24:57.369 --> 24:59.336
But how long before...

24:59.337 --> 25:00.736
(exhales deeply)

25:02.173 --> 25:03.838
If someone...

25:04.723 --> 25:08.878
if someone was to go
after me again like...

25:09.780 --> 25:12.581
like in the parking lot...

25:14.580 --> 25:16.452
It's just going to take time.

25:16.453 --> 25:18.673
But we'll keep practicing.

25:18.889 --> 25:22.125
And you're doing really well.

25:22.126 --> 25:24.283
