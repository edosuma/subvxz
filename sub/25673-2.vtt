00:00.010 --> 00:01.819
- Previously on "Wrecked"...
- I think you're a pretty cool guy.

00:01.839 --> 00:03.120
Oh, you're the cooler guy.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.900
He killed Luther. And
I'm going after him.

00:06.939 --> 00:08.420
There's someone here!

00:09.520 --> 00:11.370
It's coming right at me!

00:13.480 --> 00:14.879
Hello, there.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.980
Sorry about that.

00:22.020 --> 00:25.000
Tiki there never was much for manners.

00:25.740 --> 00:27.020
Who the hell are you?

00:27.100 --> 00:30.020
Oh, pardon me, I'm...
I'm Declan Stanwick.

00:30.090 --> 00:34.040
And welcome to "Jurassic Park"!

00:39.470 --> 00:41.180
This is my private island.

00:41.420 --> 00:42.819
Do you people need any help?

00:42.820 --> 00:44.059
This is your island?

00:44.060 --> 00:46.570
Yes, this is my sandy speck of paradise

00:46.580 --> 00:48.760
in the great blue bath

00:48.840 --> 00:49.840
that we... Oh, hello.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.180
It was your land mines that
killed my best friend!

00:55.920 --> 00:57.040
Land mine?

00:57.820 --> 00:59.960
Oh, no. Did you come
from the north beach?

01:00.090 --> 01:01.620
Yes, it was a beach,

01:01.640 --> 01:03.220
and Luther died there!

01:03.230 --> 01:04.640
And it's all your fault!

01:05.560 --> 01:07.320
It... It is... It is my fault.

01:07.900 --> 01:11.800
This island was once a-a
militant stronghold.

01:11.860 --> 01:14.360
The mines, I thought
we'd cleared them all.

01:15.940 --> 01:17.420
He was your best friend?

01:17.570 --> 01:18.940
Yes.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.560
Oh, my poor man.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.060
Words simply cannot express

01:24.220 --> 01:27.560
the depth of my sorrow f-for...

01:27.580 --> 01:29.120
- what was his name?
- Luther.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.130
- Luther?
- Yes.

01:30.140 --> 01:33.050
Luther!!

01:37.440 --> 01:41.060
I swear to you his death
will not be in vain.

01:41.660 --> 01:45.000
I will start a foundation
in Luther's name,

01:45.060 --> 01:47.200
and it shall be known as...

01:48.270 --> 01:51.539
... Luther's Landmines.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.940
You... did all you could.

01:57.860 --> 01:59.900
I could've done more.

02:01.300 --> 02:03.660
Through the foundation, you will.

02:04.090 --> 02:05.180
We will!

02:06.340 --> 02:07.420
We will.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.139
Everyone!

02:11.140 --> 02:12.960
This is Declan.

02:13.030 --> 02:14.660
He's here to help.

02:15.030 --> 02:16.439
Yes.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.740
Won't you... come with me?

02:27.260 --> 02:30.240
A plane crash, then pirates,
then a sinking ship.

02:30.260 --> 02:32.740
Seems you people can survive anything.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.920
Speaking of, why are there
killer gorillas here?

02:36.120 --> 02:38.790
Yeah, what is this, Skull Island?

02:40.060 --> 02:41.820
Is this Skull Island?

02:41.900 --> 02:44.900
This is my personal hunting reserve.

02:45.130 --> 02:47.019
I import big game animals.

02:47.020 --> 02:49.920
Tiki and his mate Olive came
from a zoo in old Montreal.

02:50.130 --> 02:52.199
This way. My villa's just up ahead.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.520
Hey. Hey, Declan?

02:53.540 --> 02:55.939
So, you just live out here
in the jungle by yourself?

02:55.940 --> 02:58.720
No, I really divide my time
between London and Dubai.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.920
And my yacht, of course, in Mallorca.

03:00.940 --> 03:04.210
This is just a private
retreat where I can bring...

03:04.280 --> 03:06.349
special friends.

03:06.350 --> 03:08.570
Are you getting creep
vibes from this guy?

03:08.580 --> 03:09.790
Major creep vibes.

03:09.820 --> 03:11.230
I don't know what it is. He's just...

03:11.240 --> 03:14.820
So dope! I mean, a yacht
and his own island?

03:14.890 --> 03:16.480
Playboy's doing it right.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.890
How does he keep his suit so clean?

03:18.960 --> 03:21.840
Welcome, friends, to my humble abode!

03:30.700 --> 03:32.440
Whoo!

03:32.510 --> 03:33.560
Martha!

03:34.310 --> 03:36.840
I have found some weary travelers.

03:36.910 --> 03:39.910
What say we whip up some
refreshments for them, hmm?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.760
Ooh, what do you all feel like?

03:41.780 --> 03:44.520
Tapas? Hmm? Small plates?

03:44.590 --> 03:45.830
Well, first things first,

03:45.860 --> 03:47.380
I'd like to check my work e-mail.

03:47.660 --> 03:48.830
- Yes, e-mail!
- Whoo!

03:50.220 --> 03:52.460
No, no, no. Un-Un-Unfortunately,

03:52.500 --> 03:54.790
the lodge is, by design, a dead zone.

03:54.900 --> 03:56.300
There's no Wi-Fi, no cellular.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.460
It forces me to truly unplug.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.490
I do, however, have a wideband radio

04:00.500 --> 04:01.860
I had installed for emergencies.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.080
You know, I shall fire it
up, hail the authorities,

04:04.100 --> 04:06.020
and arrange...

04:06.240 --> 04:07.510
for your rescue.

04:07.520 --> 04:08.520
There it is!

04:11.580 --> 04:15.050
Can you imagine being
bros with a billionaire?

04:15.400 --> 04:17.720
The parties, the jets,

04:17.839 --> 04:19.890
doing burn-outs in a Lambo?

04:25.960 --> 04:28.820
Nice! Boom!

04:28.860 --> 04:31.670
Ding!

04:31.730 --> 04:33.240
So sick.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.460
You're delusional.

04:35.670 --> 04:37.859
I can imagine him being friends with me.

04:39.140 --> 04:41.580
Whatever, dude. Rich guys love me.

04:41.620 --> 04:44.539
I promise you, it is not Valyrian steel.

04:44.540 --> 04:46.210
- We don't know that.
- We do.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.100
- C-Can't I just ask?
- Hey!

04:48.140 --> 04:50.080
Hey, so, we've got a bad
feeling about Declan.

04:50.220 --> 04:52.330
- What do you mean?
- There's just something about him

04:52.350 --> 04:53.800
- that's setting off our creep radar.
- Mm-hmm.

04:53.820 --> 04:55.659
I don't know. He seems fine to me.

04:55.660 --> 04:58.900
- Oh, my God.
- Of course he seems fine to you,

04:58.920 --> 05:01.499
'cause as a man, you
don't have to constantly

05:01.500 --> 05:03.070
be looking out for red flags.

05:03.100 --> 05:04.700
He's a rich white dude

05:04.770 --> 05:07.600
- who lives in the middle of nowhere.
- That's a red flag.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.059
All this hung velvet?

05:09.060 --> 05:10.920
That's... That's literally a red flag.

05:11.270 --> 05:13.250
I don't know if he's, like, a sex creep

05:13.260 --> 05:14.790
or, like, a cult creep

05:14.810 --> 05:17.250
or he, like, "throws
ladies in wells" creep,

05:17.280 --> 05:18.660
but he's definitely the kind of creep

05:18.680 --> 05:20.460
who puts his hand on your lower back

05:20.480 --> 05:21.879
when he's trying to move past you,

05:21.880 --> 05:23.976
- even though there's so much room.
- Oh, God, I hate it.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.530
- No. I can't.
- I know, right? It's the worst.

05:25.550 --> 05:26.550
Okay, ladies?

05:26.640 --> 05:28.770
I think it is perfectly understandable

05:28.780 --> 05:30.550
- that you would feel this way.
- Oh, thank you.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.110
- Thank you.
- But, in this case,

05:32.120 --> 05:33.176
I think you're overreacting.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.090
What?!

05:35.160 --> 05:36.499
- So, you're saying we're crazy?
- O-kay!

05:36.500 --> 05:38.080
Not saying you're crazy.
Not saying that.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.810
I'm saying that it is natural
to be a little bit edgy,

05:40.820 --> 05:42.750
what with everything
that's happened before,

05:42.770 --> 05:45.370
but isn't it possible that in this case,

05:45.440 --> 05:47.240
we actually just got lucky?

05:47.280 --> 05:48.740
Good news!

05:48.820 --> 05:51.880
I managed to reach an
international aid ship.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.570
They're charting a course for the island

05:53.580 --> 05:55.360
and will be here for you in the morning.

05:55.380 --> 05:56.429
You mean we're going home,

05:56.430 --> 05:57.900
like, for real this time?

06:03.000 --> 06:05.560
Now, I thought we should
toast your good fortune

06:05.920 --> 06:07.800
with a cocktail.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.320
- Okay.
- Karen, no!

06:13.600 --> 06:15.540
Oh!

06:16.840 --> 06:18.940
We didn't see what he put in those.

06:22.640 --> 06:23.720
Mm.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.440
Mm.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.080
Strain over fresh ice.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.180
Et voilÃ .

06:34.260 --> 06:35.840
Heaven in a glass.

06:38.460 --> 06:40.980
You ever slap a drink
out of my hand again,

06:41.040 --> 06:42.399
- I'll kill you.
- No, no, no, no.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.840
Florence should be commended.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.930
After all, I'm some man you just met.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.820
Who knows what my motivations could be?

06:49.940 --> 06:51.560
Aside from getting nicely toasted.

06:56.050 --> 06:57.060
I will drink to that!

06:57.080 --> 06:58.739
- No, I'll drink to that, Declan!
- No, I said it first!

06:58.740 --> 06:59.980
I will drink to...

07:00.600 --> 07:02.460
To the places you all have been

07:03.150 --> 07:04.880
and to where you soon shall go.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.139
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.620
Mmm.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.990
Excuse me.

07:16.580 --> 07:19.960
Luther's Landmines will
be a true nonprofit.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.250
Of course, I'll take a salary to live.

07:22.270 --> 07:24.140
Maybe a company car,

07:24.210 --> 07:25.810
something German.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.456
You know, this is the first
time I've seen you, like,

07:27.480 --> 07:29.720
- not stressed out.
- Oh, my God.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.410
I'm so glad I don't have to be all,

07:31.480 --> 07:33.410
"Guys, guys, uhh!"

07:33.480 --> 07:36.240
Help is on the way. We're good.

07:36.420 --> 07:38.359
I think I'm gonna like Chill Owen.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.800
Uh, yeah.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.690
Crab rangoons with a
miso-plum dipping sauce.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.340
You know, this place would completely

07:46.360 --> 07:47.880
fall to pieces without Martha.

07:47.980 --> 07:50.160
Yeah, Jess doesn't cook for shit.

07:52.770 --> 07:55.980
If Declan's using this place
as a skeevy bang shack,

07:56.020 --> 07:57.570
Martha would know.

07:58.300 --> 07:59.500
Let's go.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.400
So funny, man!

08:02.460 --> 08:04.240
Oh, I love to laugh!

08:04.310 --> 08:06.670
Hey, Declan? I couldn't
help but noticing

08:06.680 --> 08:08.940
this 1874 McMillan.

08:08.980 --> 08:11.550
- Very nice!
- Oh, I see I'm in the presence

08:11.560 --> 08:13.140
of a fellow scotch man.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.250
Well, if enjoying a balanced single malt

08:15.260 --> 08:16.950
with a firm, creamy mouthfeel

08:16.980 --> 08:18.440
makes me a scotch man, well, then,

08:18.460 --> 08:20.420
I guess I'm guilty as cheers'd.

08:22.820 --> 08:25.620
You know, I think we shall have
to arrange a tasting later on.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.310
Oh, yeah.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.739
Why wait?

08:28.740 --> 08:30.660
Let's scotch it up.

08:31.070 --> 08:32.659
- Whoop!
- What are you doing?

08:32.740 --> 08:35.039
Whoa! Oh!

08:35.059 --> 08:36.640
That's naughty, but nice.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.059
Just a little flair. Don't be scared.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.360
Shots. Uhh.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.480
Uhh!

08:42.549 --> 08:43.899
Oh!

08:43.900 --> 08:45.560
Nailed it!

08:45.600 --> 08:47.090
There's one in my holster.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.320
Ah! Hey!

08:52.430 --> 08:53.700
Party foul.

08:53.740 --> 08:55.740
Right? No worries, though, Dec.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.739
I will pay for that.

08:57.740 --> 08:59.160
How much do I owe you?

08:59.220 --> 09:00.220
It's quite all right.

09:00.230 --> 09:02.639
- I'll just get Martha to fetch another one.
- No, no, no, no, no, dude.

09:02.640 --> 09:05.039
I'm good for it. What's
the damage, Chief?

09:05.040 --> 09:06.480
Oh, well...

09:06.980 --> 09:09.440
- $40,000.
- What in the world?

09:09.510 --> 09:10.940
- That's it?!
- Mm.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.120
40 grand?

09:12.640 --> 09:13.820
I got it.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.139
Hi!

09:17.140 --> 09:18.589
Yes?

09:18.590 --> 09:20.100
Do you need to toilet?

09:20.520 --> 09:22.460
No, we just wanted to tell you

09:22.520 --> 09:24.100
your rangoons are amazing.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.840
So, Martha, how is it
working for Mr. Stanwick?

09:31.920 --> 09:34.600
Mr. Stanwick is a remarkable man.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.560
He works very hard,

09:36.740 --> 09:38.220
and this is what makes him unique...

09:38.240 --> 09:40.600
he also plays hard.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.350
Martha, does he ever play...

09:45.410 --> 09:46.680
too hard?

09:46.750 --> 09:48.350
What do you mean?

09:48.420 --> 09:50.750
Does Mr. Stanwick ever do anything

09:50.760 --> 09:52.219
to make you feel uncomfortable?

09:52.220 --> 09:54.080
I...

09:54.760 --> 09:58.490
really shouldn't say anything.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.300
There.

10:06.370 --> 10:07.640
Now, you can speak freely.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.770
If word got back to him, I
dread what would happen,

10:10.840 --> 10:13.340
but I can't stay silent any longer.

10:13.660 --> 10:17.120
You see, as long as I've worked for him,

10:17.220 --> 10:20.380
Mr. Stanwick has made a sick habit of...

10:21.980 --> 10:25.250
... not washing his hands
after he toilets.

10:29.780 --> 10:30.940
Thank you.

10:31.390 --> 10:32.640
- No problem.
- It's cool.

10:35.660 --> 10:37.920
I don't know what...

10:40.800 --> 10:43.370
Ah, Declan. Thank you so much.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.940
I just want to say, everything
has been truly magnifique.

10:46.010 --> 10:48.410
Oh, the best is yet to come.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.120
My friends!

10:50.200 --> 10:53.100
Martha will now show you to your rooms.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.580
I want you well-rested.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.540
Tomorrow's going to be a very big day.

10:57.820 --> 11:00.150
We're so grateful. Thank
you for your service.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.680
Care to meet in my room
later for some humping?

11:03.700 --> 11:05.489
Shh! Jesus!

11:05.490 --> 11:07.180
I'm not that drunk.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.430
Where's your room?

11:10.770 --> 11:12.480
Todd, none of this feels right.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.880
I don't think we can trust this guy.

11:13.900 --> 11:16.010
Copy that. Pack's the worst.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.910
Now we got to ask your
dad for another $40,000.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.559
What? No, I mean Declan.

11:20.560 --> 11:21.709
What?

11:21.710 --> 11:24.920
Declan's the coolest,
babe. Don't be cray.

11:26.650 --> 11:28.630
I can't end the night like this.

11:28.650 --> 11:30.180
I have to go be with him.

11:43.380 --> 11:45.740
Florence!

11:45.780 --> 11:48.140
- I was coming to find you.
- I was coming to find you.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.120
Todd just straight-up called me crazy

11:50.140 --> 11:51.259
for not trusting Declan.

11:51.260 --> 11:52.939
I tried to get Owen and Danny

11:52.940 --> 11:54.050
to look for hidden cameras

11:54.080 --> 11:55.760
and they went off to find the hot tub.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.140
If they're not gonna listen to us,

11:57.150 --> 11:58.720
we will just have to prove it to them.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.810
- Yes, bitch.
- Yes, bitch!

12:00.880 --> 12:02.860
Okay, all right. So, I was thinking,

12:02.880 --> 12:04.860
if there's creepo
toilet cameras in here,

12:04.890 --> 12:07.080
there's got to be monitors
somewhere, right?

12:07.360 --> 12:10.290
Ooh, the basement.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.110
Creeps always go underground

12:12.120 --> 12:14.560
to do their nasty, nasty business.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.079
What's up, Dec? Uh, couldn't sleep,

12:18.080 --> 12:21.540
so I thought maybe you and I
could crush some nightcaps.

12:21.560 --> 12:23.760
What a splendid idea.

12:24.460 --> 12:26.300
I think we need another glass.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.440
Absolutely. Got it, Dec.

12:29.810 --> 12:31.400
What are you doing here?

12:31.420 --> 12:32.779
What are you doing here?

12:32.780 --> 12:34.380
Oh, you're so desperate.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.520
Whoa. Bingo.

12:39.590 --> 12:42.320
You don't put a keypad
on a freaking half-bath.

12:42.390 --> 12:43.640
How do we get in?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.860
- I can hack it.
- Huh?

12:45.930 --> 12:47.880
Sort of. Well, so, if you look

12:47.900 --> 12:49.550
at an iPhone from way over on the side,

12:49.560 --> 12:50.699
you can see smudges

12:50.700 --> 12:52.420
on whichever keys get used the most.

12:52.470 --> 12:54.019
You have to do this on
Todd's phone a lot?

12:54.020 --> 12:55.399
Yeah, I do.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.070
Okay, there are marks on the 6 and the 9

12:58.110 --> 12:59.120
and that's it.

12:59.140 --> 13:00.810
Just the 6 and 9?

13:06.880 --> 13:09.549
- Ew, gross.
- Oh, my God, of course!

13:12.690 --> 13:13.899
I knew it!

13:13.900 --> 13:15.689
He's got cameras everywhere.

13:15.690 --> 13:17.940
Nice dungeon lighting, dude.

13:18.020 --> 13:19.406
There's Owen and Danny in the hot tub,

13:19.430 --> 13:21.560
probably sword fighting.

13:21.630 --> 13:22.960
Is that Karen?

13:23.030 --> 13:25.470
Oh, my God!

13:25.480 --> 13:28.630
She's hooking up with Steve again. Ew!

13:28.640 --> 13:30.550
- Oh, my God.
- I know, right?

13:30.570 --> 13:32.880
She has perfect tits.

13:37.580 --> 13:38.820
Emma?!

13:47.660 --> 13:49.430
What the hell? I mean, like,

13:49.460 --> 13:52.130
- what the hell?!
- Who are these people?!

13:52.190 --> 13:54.380
Emma, what happened?

13:54.860 --> 13:57.480
Mr. Stanwick doesn't like trespassers.

13:57.560 --> 14:01.270
You! We asked you if Declan
does anything weird,

14:01.340 --> 14:03.850
and you don't think
this counts as weird?!

14:03.860 --> 14:05.039
What did he do to them?!

14:05.040 --> 14:07.280
You'll find out soon enough.

14:07.740 --> 14:09.010
Come with me.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.660
- No.
- No way.

14:10.740 --> 14:12.210
All right, then.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.840
I'll just have to make you.

14:20.220 --> 14:21.220
Come!

14:23.360 --> 14:24.760
Come!

14:24.770 --> 14:26.289
- What is she doing that?
- What... What's happening?

14:26.290 --> 14:27.690
Come!

14:27.700 --> 14:29.420
- Does she think we're dogs?
- I don't know.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.560
Come!

14:31.030 --> 14:32.650
- Jess, what are you doing?!
- What?! I don't know! Sorry.

14:32.660 --> 14:33.840
She's clapping so hard!

14:34.280 --> 14:35.720
All right, then.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.500
Help!

14:39.620 --> 14:41.509
Help! Help!

14:41.510 --> 14:44.100
Oh, hell, yeah.

14:44.110 --> 14:46.290
You mind if we light up
one of these stogies?

14:46.310 --> 14:47.510
Those are Cubans.

14:47.580 --> 14:49.290
I save them for special occasions.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.300
I think tonight certainly
qualifies, don't you?

14:51.380 --> 14:53.300
Nice. Let's do this.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.040
Hey, Pack, uh,

14:55.520 --> 14:57.170
you probably want to sit
this one out, right?

14:57.190 --> 14:59.880
Little guy like you? Little lungs?

15:00.730 --> 15:01.959
Pfft!

15:01.960 --> 15:03.960
No way. I love Cubans.

15:04.130 --> 15:05.329
Everything about it, you know,

15:05.330 --> 15:08.199
the country, cigars, sandwiches.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.239
Here you go, player.

15:10.740 --> 15:11.800
Take a big pull.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.040
Cheers.

15:24.150 --> 15:25.990
Just as smooth as I thought.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.550
What are we gonna do?!
We've gotta warn the others!

15:28.560 --> 15:31.550
I don't know, but can I just
take a moment to point out

15:31.560 --> 15:34.559
- that we were right about Declan?
- We were so right!

15:34.560 --> 15:36.870
I'm sorry, but can we
just vent for a second?

15:36.880 --> 15:38.746
Like, no one was listening
and now here we are, just...

15:38.770 --> 15:39.940
Wait, wait, wait.

15:43.940 --> 15:46.240
Oh, so choice.

15:46.310 --> 15:47.820
You ready for round 2, Dec?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.480
Don't mind if I deux.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.500
Pack?

15:51.560 --> 15:53.179
Oh, big-time, baby.

15:53.180 --> 15:56.900
I'm so ready. I just gotta
pop over to the bathroom.

16:00.420 --> 16:01.600
Okay.

16:02.460 --> 16:03.760
See you in a bit.

16:05.140 --> 16:07.260
So, Dec,

16:07.880 --> 16:10.799
you ever been to Lake Havasu?

16:10.800 --> 16:12.910
It's Arizona's playground.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.090
I-Is he taking a shower in there?

16:17.100 --> 16:18.520
I don't know. He's a clean freak.

16:18.540 --> 16:21.360
Anyway, I got a booze
boat docked out there.

16:25.210 --> 16:27.760
I think you'd better go
check on your friend.

16:28.940 --> 16:30.350
Sure.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.890
He's probably, uh, just freshening up.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.406
What are you... ?

16:37.430 --> 16:39.659
You idiot, you're making
us both look bad.

16:39.660 --> 16:42.120
- Why is the damn shower on?
- Because I had to barf,

16:42.140 --> 16:43.346
and I didn't want Declan to hear me.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.080
Now you've gotta be all
wet when you come out.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.350
No, I don't have to be wet.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.699
At least put your head under the spout.

16:47.700 --> 16:48.960
- No.
- Do it!

16:49.000 --> 16:50.350
- No!
- Screw it.

16:50.370 --> 16:52.540
Come on. Do it!

16:53.040 --> 16:55.750
Why don't you go sell a condo
somewhere, you piece of shit!

16:55.780 --> 16:57.640
- I'm gonna throw up again!
- No, don't!

16:57.710 --> 17:00.310
Ew, gross. Crab rangoons!

17:00.380 --> 17:03.460
- Oh, Christ.
- Why didn't you just turn the fan on?

17:03.500 --> 17:05.449
Ugh! Sick!

17:05.450 --> 17:08.240
It smells like puke and cigars in here!

17:08.790 --> 17:11.858
I'm freaking out. How
far do we have to go?

17:11.859 --> 17:13.390
I don't know.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.099
How do we get out of here?!

17:15.140 --> 17:17.300
I don't know!!

17:20.670 --> 17:23.269
I think I could get used to this.

17:23.270 --> 17:25.010
Uh, yeah.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.940
All right, Dec.

17:29.020 --> 17:31.210
We're all good in there. We're just...

17:31.280 --> 17:32.660
Oh, shit!

17:32.680 --> 17:34.950
Declan? You happy now?

17:35.020 --> 17:36.199
He bailed on us

17:36.200 --> 17:37.840
'cause you're being all
freak of the week.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.820
Aah!

17:41.920 --> 17:43.870
Did you just chuck a book at me?

17:43.890 --> 17:44.980
You're freak of the week!

17:44.990 --> 17:46.919
Not this week! Not any week!

17:46.920 --> 17:48.159
- Oh, you want some?!
- Not any week!

17:48.160 --> 17:49.400
Ow! My elbow!

17:49.500 --> 17:52.030
- God damn it!
- C'mon. Aah!

17:52.040 --> 17:53.520
Bring it! I dare you!

17:53.640 --> 17:54.980
Ow!

17:56.020 --> 17:57.420
Ow!

18:02.940 --> 18:04.980
Oh!

18:05.050 --> 18:08.500
- It's a secret passageway.
- So cool. Declan rules.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.980
- Oh, neon.
- Sick.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.299
So sick.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.919
Is that mahogany?

18:18.700 --> 18:21.840
No, no, no, no, no!

18:24.220 --> 18:27.800
- Aah!
- Aah!

18:29.870 --> 18:31.450
I think it's coming from up here.

18:32.940 --> 18:34.680
Is that Florence?

18:34.880 --> 18:37.080
Please help! We're in the vents!

18:37.140 --> 18:38.860
Well, what the hell are
you doing in the vents?!

18:38.880 --> 18:40.280
Let us out!!

18:41.500 --> 18:43.280
Whoa!

18:46.420 --> 18:47.890
Oh, my God.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.730
Emma's head is on the wall!

18:49.760 --> 18:51.740
Her head is chopped off, and
it's on the wall and like...

18:51.760 --> 18:53.760
- Okay, calm down.
- There's no time!

18:53.830 --> 18:55.460
Where's Todd? We've gotta go!

18:55.470 --> 18:58.219
- You sound hysterical.
- Your tone is very shrill.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.480
Will you just listen to us?!

18:59.500 --> 19:01.099
You guys! You guys!

19:01.100 --> 19:02.699
This place is bad news!

19:02.700 --> 19:05.110
The dude has human heads on the wall!

19:05.120 --> 19:06.220
Everybody, get their stuff.
We've gotta go.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.440
No. Stay.

19:12.460 --> 19:13.760
I insist.

19:13.980 --> 19:15.250
Holy shit.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.850
Todd and Pack were right.

19:24.880 --> 19:28.000
I do hope you'll be comfortable here.

19:28.340 --> 19:30.170
Or not. I really don't care.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.310
I can't believe I wanted
to be bros with you.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.180
Everything you said about Luther,

19:35.240 --> 19:36.580
it was all a lie?!

19:36.740 --> 19:38.339
Yes, it was.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.080
I planted those mines.

19:40.140 --> 19:42.040
I thought they worked smashingly.

19:42.340 --> 19:45.640
I don't know how and I don't know when,

19:45.680 --> 19:47.280
but I will kill you.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.520
Not if I kill him first.

19:52.950 --> 19:55.890
Love the spirit, but it
won't happen, of course.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.560
You forgot one thing,

19:57.630 --> 19:59.160
Dick-lan.

19:59.230 --> 20:02.500
There's an international aid
ship coming to rescue us.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.820
You lose, bro.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.280
Does someone else want
to tell him or... ?

20:11.300 --> 20:13.040
Danny, he didn't actually call the ship.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.740
Oh...

20:16.620 --> 20:18.380
You son of a bitch!

20:19.320 --> 20:21.600
What is with you people and spitting?

20:21.620 --> 20:23.249
So, what are you gonna do?
Are you just gonna kill us?

20:23.250 --> 20:25.250
No, I'm going to break you

20:25.320 --> 20:27.760
and watch you turn on each other.

20:27.780 --> 20:29.036
Yeah, but that's not gonna happen,

20:29.060 --> 20:30.920
because the nine of us
have been through too...

20:30.990 --> 20:33.570
- Whoa, whoa, I count 8.
- What?

20:33.580 --> 20:35.700
- Wait, who's missing?
- 1, 2, 3...

20:35.720 --> 20:37.370
- Where's Chet?
- Did we lose Chet?!

20:37.380 --> 20:38.580
- Did he get lost?
- Ugh.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.000
Martha?

20:40.070 --> 20:41.670
Find this Chet.

20:44.870 --> 20:48.080
I see it's every man
for himself already.

20:48.500 --> 20:51.140
Good. That'll help...

20:51.480 --> 20:54.040
when you're hunting each
other to the death.

20:57.640 --> 21:00.100
I think we're in trouble.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.670
