WEBVTT

00:25.900 --> 00:26.985
Yeah!

00:48.715 --> 00:53.428
Younglings, the time has come
for you to see more of the galaxy.

00:54.095 --> 00:58.266
Sending you to different
faraway outpost temples, I am.

00:58.266 --> 01:01.352
You will continue training
with your teachers.

01:01.352 --> 01:04.355
Learn, explore, help others.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.440
Hmm.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.610
I look forward to seeing how you grow.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.112
May the Force be with you.

01:12.655 --> 01:14.407
Thank you, Master Yoda.

01:14.407 --> 01:17.535
Dee, are the younglings ready
for their shuttles to planet Tenoo?

01:17.535 --> 01:19.829
All but three, Master Zia.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.457
Let me guess.

01:22.957 --> 01:26.419
Lys, Nubs, and Kai Brightstar.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.677
Lys, Nubs, you having as much fun as I am?

01:35.762 --> 01:37.680
Best idea ever, Kai.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.768
One last chance to break our training
course record before we leave for Tenoo.

01:41.768 --> 01:45.271
We need to get that beacon
without those droids slowing us down.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.148
I've got an idea.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.778
Over here, droidy droids.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.788
- This is our chance!

02:01.788 --> 02:03.498
Okay, now, Nubs!

02:06.126 --> 02:08.753
- Whoa!

02:14.008 --> 02:15.343
- Kai, we can help.

02:15.343 --> 02:17.178
Nah, I got this.

02:17.178 --> 02:20.140
Stay back and watch a future Jedi Master.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.020
We're coming, Kai!

02:28.189 --> 02:30.400
You don't need to do
everything alone, Kai.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.985
That's what friends are for.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.486
I really thought I had it.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.488
That's all right.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.407
We'll get that beacon together.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.829
Almost there.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.331
- Yes! We broke our record!

02:48.918 --> 02:50.003
Whoo-hoo.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.923
Too tight. Can't breathe.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.468
-<i>Oh, thank the Force I found you.</i>

02:57.468 --> 02:59.220
<i>Our shuttles to Tenoo are leaving.</i>

02:59.220 --> 03:01.264
Sorry we're late, Master Zia.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.557
<i>It's okay. Just hurry.</i>

03:02.557 --> 03:05.935
<i>You'll be on the last shuttle.
I'll meet you on Tenoo with the others.</i>

03:05.935 --> 03:08.188
- Yes, Master Zia.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.403
Almost fixed it.

03:17.947 --> 03:20.241
You okay, RJ-83?

03:22.577 --> 03:25.121
Shake it off, buddy.

03:25.121 --> 03:27.749
And we're all ready to fly.

03:27.749 --> 03:28.917
Hey, there!

03:29.584 --> 03:32.795
Master Zia told us this
was the last shuttle to Tenoo.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.255
Do you know who the pilot is?

03:34.255 --> 03:36.049
- Hmm. The pilot?

03:36.758 --> 03:37.800
Sure.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.011
That's me.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.346
- You're the pilot?

03:41.346 --> 03:43.014
- But you're a kid.

03:43.681 --> 03:46.267
Uh, you're a kid. What's your point?

03:46.267 --> 03:47.560
- Hmm.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.978
- Uh--

03:48.978 --> 03:51.731
The name's Nash. Nash Durango.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.900
This is RJ-83, my copilot.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.904
- I'm Kai. Nice to meet you both.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.490
- These are my best friends, Lys and Nubs.

04:01.199 --> 04:05.161
Welcome to the <i>Crimson Firehawk</i>,
your transport to Tenoo.

04:05.161 --> 04:06.621
Oh, watch your step.

04:06.621 --> 04:09.499
There are a few things
I haven't had a chance to fix yet.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.673
- This ship is all yours?

04:16.673 --> 04:19.133
Yep. All mine.

04:19.133 --> 04:22.553
The <i>Crimson Firehawk</i> was an old ship
my parents let me and RJ fix up.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.430
They run a shuttle company on Tenoo.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.516
People, creatures, supplies.

04:26.516 --> 04:30.019
We transport anything and anyone
all over the galaxy.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.651
Whoa.

04:36.651 --> 04:37.944
Wow.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.740
All right, we're ready to make the jump
to hyperspace.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.867
That'll get us to Tenoo fast.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.369
This is the fun part.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.621
RJ? Let's punch it.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.672
We have a little time
until we arrive at Tenoo.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.966
RJ will watch the cockpit
while we hang out here.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.843
I've got food, games.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.219
- Wow.
- Whatever you want.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.513
Help yourself. My ship is your ship.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.182
Ooh!

05:10.727 --> 05:11.811
Whoa.

05:13.563 --> 05:17.108
That's Giggs. I'm taking her to a new home
at an animal preserve on Tenoo.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.860
She doesn't really like people.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.195
- Aw. A Gedonian Ground Weevil.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.530
I read about these.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.408
Never mind. [chuckles] She likes you.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.660
Lys is great with creatures.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.496
You have hologames?

05:31.164 --> 05:32.206
Sure.

05:32.206 --> 05:34.250
We don't play a lot
of hologames at the Temple.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.877
What do you do at the Temple?

05:35.877 --> 05:38.338
We train to become Jedi Knights.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.049
Like heroes going around
saving the day or something?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.342
Kinda, yeah.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.470
Jedi Knights help others
and train in the ways of the Force.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.931
Yeah, I've heard Jedi can move things
without touching them. Is that true?

05:48.931 --> 05:52.185
Oh, can you make this float
through the air with your fancy powers?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.145
We can.

05:54.145 --> 05:57.815
But using the Force takes practice,
training, and concentration.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.025
It's not easy.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.529
Looks like we're about to arrive at Tenoo.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.614
Come on.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.494
Coming out of hyperspace... now!

06:12.163 --> 06:13.331
Ooh!

06:13.331 --> 06:14.791
- Welcome to Tenoo!

06:14.791 --> 06:17.085
My home sweet home, and now yours too.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.711
Okay, let's get you to--

06:19.837 --> 06:21.631
Huh. I'm getting a call.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.299
- Hey, Hap.
-<i>Hey-ho, Nash.</i>

06:23.299 --> 06:26.719
<i>Those pirates I told you about are back,
and they're about to rob my café.</i>

06:26.719 --> 06:28.554
<i>There's no one here to stop them.</i>

06:28.554 --> 06:31.599
<i>I heard you might have Jedi with you
that could help.</i>

06:31.599 --> 06:32.683
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.103
<i>Kids?</i>

06:35.103 --> 06:39.607
<i>I-I was thinking you might
be full-grown Jedi.</i>

06:39.607 --> 06:41.651
Hey. We can still help.

06:41.651 --> 06:42.735
You sure, Kai?

06:43.820 --> 06:46.239
Of course. This is what we train for.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.909
Besides, Master Yoda sent us
out here to help people.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.245
You're right. Hap, we're on our way.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.665
<i>Okay. Please hurry.</i>

07:02.505 --> 07:05.883
Taborr.

07:05.883 --> 07:09.262
Didn't you steal enough from me
last time you were here?

07:09.262 --> 07:12.181
You should be out having fun
with your friends.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.352
What do you think we're doing now?

07:16.352 --> 07:18.146
Being a pirate is fun.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.023
We steal and take whatever we want.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.526
Hurry up, Jedi.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.822
Kublop Springs, my hometown.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.323
Wow.
Whoa!

07:29.323 --> 07:31.200
- Look at those giant trees.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.619
Unfortunately,
there's no time for a tour.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.498
All right, the pirates should be
just around the corner at Hap's.

07:37.498 --> 07:41.002
I need to stay with the ship.
Call me on this comm if you need any help.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.295
Thanks, Nash.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.796
We can do this together.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.339
- Ready?

07:45.339 --> 07:46.883
- Absolutely!

07:48.718 --> 07:51.804
Looks like we have just about everything.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.640
Oh, I'll take this hat too.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.559
- How dare you, Taborr!

07:56.559 --> 07:58.478
Give that stuff back, pirate!

07:58.478 --> 08:00.271
- It's not yours.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.231
Who are you?

08:02.940 --> 08:04.400
We're Jedi.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.195
And you need to give everyone
their stuff back.

08:08.488 --> 08:12.783
This is my stuff now,
and I'm not giving anything back.

08:12.783 --> 08:16.329
Pord, EB-3, take the cart back to my ship.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.998
I'll deal with these Jedi.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.422
Ooh, fancy laser sword.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.758
It's called a lightsaber.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.385
Nubs, stop those pirates!

08:49.320 --> 08:51.155
Table for one!

08:59.372 --> 09:01.415
Hmm. You've got some skills.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.708
So do you.

09:10.424 --> 09:11.676
- Huh?

09:11.676 --> 09:13.761
- We need help.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.264
- Time to have a little more fun!

09:17.640 --> 09:18.891
Uh--

09:23.396 --> 09:24.438
My café!

09:25.856 --> 09:27.567
I got it!

09:30.528 --> 09:33.364
The Force is with me.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.741
Have fun, Jedi!

09:36.284 --> 09:37.660
Time to make a getaway.

09:42.456 --> 09:43.916
I can't do this alone.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.836
Lys, Nubs, I need your help.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.588
- That's what friends are for.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.714
Yeah!

09:59.265 --> 10:00.891
Thanks, kids.

10:00.891 --> 10:03.811
But, uh, Taborr's still getting away
with our stuff!

10:03.811 --> 10:05.771
There's not enough time to stop them!

10:05.771 --> 10:06.856
Yes, there is.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.442
We just need a little help
from our new friends.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.777
Nash, RJ, come in!

10:12.695 --> 10:15.114
Get that inside! Hurry!

10:20.911 --> 10:23.039
- Bringing it up, RJ.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.250
What do we do now?
Stop them!

10:33.090 --> 10:35.593
Nash slowed 'em down! Now, Nubs!

10:37.887 --> 10:40.640
- Whoa!

10:41.390 --> 10:42.475
Eh?

10:45.519 --> 10:47.605
No! That's mine!

10:49.482 --> 10:50.983
It's theirs, Taborr!

10:50.983 --> 10:52.568
And it's time you leave!

10:55.655 --> 11:00.660
Fine. But I'll make sure you Jedi wish
you had never come out here.

11:03.829 --> 11:07.083
Yay! Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

11:08.084 --> 11:10.336
- Yeah! We did it!

11:10.336 --> 11:11.545
Whoo-hoo.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.676
That's our new temple?

11:17.426 --> 11:19.512
- Wow!
- Whoa.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.100
Sorry we're late, Master Zia.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.435
Younglings, we heard what happened.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.604
I'm so proud of you.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.606
Helping people is what Jedi do.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.149
Thanks, Master Zia.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.819
- Couldn't have done it without my friends.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.362
And our new friends too.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.365
Aw.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.450
- Still too tight, Nubs.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.745
Now let me show you
around your new home.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.706
And your new friends can come too.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.999
Really? A tour of a Jedi Temple?

11:48.999 --> 11:52.002
Can't believe this is our home now.

11:52.002 --> 11:54.004
It's amazing.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.423
Yes, Nubs.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.007
I'm sure there's food.

11:57.007 --> 12:00.469
- And, yes, you can have seconds.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.016
- This droid's tougher than I thought!
- Whoa.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.856
Remember, to pass the training course,

12:11.856 --> 12:15.443
you must get by that droid
and all be on the platform together.

12:15.443 --> 12:16.694
Timer's almost up!

12:17.403 --> 12:20.114
Go, team! Beat that bucket of bolts!

12:21.240 --> 12:23.909
- What? Master Zia said I could watch.

12:23.909 --> 12:27.288
Wait! Why fight the droid
when you could go over it?

12:32.835 --> 12:34.712
I made it! Come on, you two.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.513
Nubs!

12:44.513 --> 12:45.598
Uh-oh.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.224
Can't reach you.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.186
- Whoo-hoo! Whoa.

12:51.395 --> 12:52.938
Hold on, Nubs. I'm coming!

12:58.194 --> 13:00.321
My lightsaber! Gotta get it back!

13:00.321 --> 13:01.614
Kai, there's no time!

13:01.614 --> 13:03.657
Leave the lightsaber. Help Nubs!

13:03.657 --> 13:04.742
Uh...

13:06.035 --> 13:07.536
I can do both.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.340
Yes!

13:22.510 --> 13:24.887
Oops.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.848
- Time's up!

13:27.848 --> 13:29.767
And we failed the training.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.978
That was wild!

13:32.978 --> 13:36.857
Nubs was, "Ah! Help!" And then boof!
What a mess!

13:36.857 --> 13:38.734
- I'm sorry, Nubs.

13:40.986 --> 13:44.114
Come, younglings. Gather round.
We have a special guest.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.954
Yoda!
- Whoa! No way.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.956
- Who's the little green guy?

13:51.956 --> 13:55.543
That's Master Yoda!
He's the greatest Jedi ever!

13:56.168 --> 13:57.753
M-Master Yoda.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.422
Did you see...

14:00.422 --> 14:03.425
See you train, I did.

14:03.425 --> 14:09.056
Kai, always focus on helping others
a Jedi must, not on objects.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.851
A lightsaber can always be replaced.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.519
Yes, Master Yoda.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.647
Students, Master Yoda has joined us today

14:16.647 --> 14:20.359
all the way from the other side
of the galaxy with special news.

14:20.359 --> 14:25.531
We are invited to a festival
in the town of Kublop Springs tonight.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.701
- Honored guests we will be.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.412
You will be performing
a special demonstration of your skills

14:31.412 --> 14:32.496
at the festival.

14:32.496 --> 14:35.082
Master Yoda is here
to train you and get you ready.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.001
- We haven't much time.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.544
Everyone, please follow me.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.048
- Kai, Lys, and Nubs, a word, mmm?

14:43.674 --> 14:46.802
An important mission for you I have.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.554
- A mission?
- Ah!

14:48.554 --> 14:50.139
Whatever you need, Master Yoda.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.850
Something for the festival,
you must get, hmm?

14:52.850 --> 14:58.022
Important to the ceremony it is
and important to me.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.149
- Directions are on this.
- Ooh!

15:00.149 --> 15:02.234
- May the Force be with you.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.239
We just got a mission from Master Yoda!

15:07.239 --> 15:09.074
- All right, everyone.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.784
To the <i>Crimson Firehawk.</i>

15:12.244 --> 15:13.996
Oh!

15:16.790 --> 15:19.877
It looks like the Jedi kids
are going on a mission.

15:20.377 --> 15:25.466
If they fail, maybe they'll get sent back
to their old temple and be gone for good!

15:26.550 --> 15:30.220
Maybe we should follow them
and steal whatever they're after.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.431
Then they'll definitely fail.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.849
Hmm.

15:33.849 --> 15:36.018
Hey, I've got an idea.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.562
We should follow them
and steal whatever they're after.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.105
Then they'll definitely fail.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.816
- That's what I--
- Pord, EB-3, to my ship!

15:47.237 --> 15:50.491
I bet whatever Master Yoda sent us
to get here is amazing!

15:50.491 --> 15:52.326
Like a legendary crystal or something!

15:52.326 --> 15:55.287
Or maybe it's a cute Argonian Ruffle bird.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.872
- Here.

15:56.872 --> 15:57.957
Ooh.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.249
- Seeds?

16:00.876 --> 16:02.795
- Nubs!

16:02.795 --> 16:04.672
Don't eat the seeds, you silly goof.

16:04.672 --> 16:07.716
Is this it? Seeds? What a strange mission.

16:07.716 --> 16:11.428
Well, if these are important
to Master Yoda, then they are to us too.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.721
- Let's head home.

16:12.721 --> 16:15.766
This was easy. We'll be back
way before the festival starts.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.434
Thanks, big guy.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.521
Okay, everyone. Buckle up and--

16:22.356 --> 16:24.191
It's a distress signal.

16:24.191 --> 16:27.027
<i>We need help! Somebody hurry. We--</i>

16:28.570 --> 16:31.365
Whoever that is, they're in trouble.
We gotta help!

16:31.365 --> 16:33.701
But what about the mission
from Master Yoda?

16:33.701 --> 16:37.121
Master Yoda said Jedi should always
focus on helping others.

16:37.121 --> 16:40.082
We could help them
then get back to the festival in time.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.209
Okay, they're close by. Follow me.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.174
They should be right around here.

16:50.926 --> 16:53.637
<i>That was me calling for help.</i>

16:53.637 --> 16:54.805
Taborr?

16:54.805 --> 16:57.975
<i>You fell for my trick
and left your ship all alone.</i>

16:57.975 --> 17:00.060
<i>Now I can take whatever I want,</i>

17:00.060 --> 17:03.188
<i>especially this bag of--</i>

17:03.188 --> 17:04.523
<i>W-Whatever this is!</i>

17:04.523 --> 17:07.026
<i>Can't wait to see
how much I can get for it.</i>

17:07.026 --> 17:08.485
<i>See you moof-milkers later.</i>

17:09.528 --> 17:12.156
- We gotta get back to the <i>Firehawk</i>!

17:12.656 --> 17:14.992
They're gone!

17:14.992 --> 17:16.535
My poor <i>Firehawk</i>.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.038
What did those mean pirates do to you?

17:19.038 --> 17:21.915
Now RJ and I have to fix you up
before we can fly.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.584
While you two work on the <i>Firehawk</i>,

17:23.584 --> 17:26.295
Lys, Nubs, and I will figure out
where Taborr went

17:26.295 --> 17:27.755
and get those seeds back.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.674
Says here there's a place nearby
called Yarrum Tower.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.051
I've heard of it.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.678
It's where pirates hang out
and sell their stolen stuff.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.263
It's too far to walk,

17:36.263 --> 17:40.434
but I've got something else
that'll get you there fast.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.687
This is the best!

17:43.687 --> 17:47.649
Whoo!

17:47.649 --> 17:49.777
There it is! Yarrum Tower!

17:53.197 --> 17:54.364
Seeds?

17:54.364 --> 17:57.117
You wanna sell worthless seeds?

17:58.202 --> 18:00.537
Seeds that I stole from Jedi!

18:00.537 --> 18:02.539
So they must be worth something.

18:02.539 --> 18:05.751
You won't get anything for these.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.796
And you call yourself a pirate.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.631
Aren't you cute?

18:11.215 --> 18:12.966
Hey! I'm not cute--

18:12.966 --> 18:16.261
Come on.
Let's go back to our ship.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.848
Kids.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.272
- There's Taborr!

18:28.857 --> 18:30.025
Worthless seeds.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.902
What does that old pirate know?

18:31.902 --> 18:33.070
Let's get outta here.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.534
- Whoa.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.328
Wonder if this is all stolen stuff.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.789
I found the seeds.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.293
Uh...

18:49.128 --> 18:50.462
Uh-oh!

18:52.214 --> 18:53.757
- Uh-oh.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.801
Maybe no one heard that?

18:57.052 --> 18:58.804
Oh, we heard it.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.265
Give that back.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.433
I stole it fair and square.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.102
This belongs to Master Yoda!

19:05.102 --> 19:06.311
Not anymore.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.856
- Get those seeds!

19:08.856 --> 19:10.732
- Lys, catch!

19:14.319 --> 19:16.947
Give up, pirates!
We won't let you take our seeds!

19:16.947 --> 19:18.866
Oh, yeah?

19:19.992 --> 19:22.161
Your turn, Nubs!

19:27.457 --> 19:30.085
Get back here, you furry furball!

19:30.085 --> 19:32.754
- Hey, where'd everyone go?

19:35.966 --> 19:37.759
- Go, go!

19:37.759 --> 19:38.844
I'll hold off Taborr.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.443
Jedi are so frustrating!

19:55.068 --> 19:57.696
- So are pirates!

20:08.457 --> 20:10.042
Nash, you made it!

20:10.042 --> 20:11.710
- RJ and I fixed the ship!

20:11.710 --> 20:12.961
Figured I'd come help.

20:12.961 --> 20:15.797
And it looks like I'm just in time.
Jump aboard.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.678
Nubs!

20:24.389 --> 20:25.849
Hold on, Nubs! I'm coming!

20:25.849 --> 20:27.142
My lightsaber!

20:27.142 --> 20:29.770
It's mine now!

20:29.770 --> 20:32.356
- Gotta get it back.

20:32.856 --> 20:35.567
- Nubs!

20:48.121 --> 20:49.998
- Way to go, Kai!

20:49.998 --> 20:52.459
Now hurry! There's too many of them!

20:52.459 --> 20:53.752
Just leave your saber.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.758
- Kai.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.346
Of course, buddy. Let's get outta here.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.993
- Master Yoda! Here.

21:27.661 --> 21:28.912
Just in time you are.

21:28.912 --> 21:31.957
- So, what's with the seeds?

21:31.957 --> 21:35.669
These are rare sparkle-fire seeds.

21:37.170 --> 21:42.092
A symbol of friendship between the Jedi
and the people of the galaxy.

21:42.092 --> 21:46.221
They celebrate the promise
of young ones who, like these seeds,

21:46.221 --> 21:49.099
will grow up strong and bright.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.060
It is time.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.576
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

22:11.621 --> 22:12.831
Wow.

22:17.961 --> 22:21.506
Master Yoda, I have something to tell you.

22:22.674 --> 22:26.178
I-- I lost my lightsaber on the mission.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.805
Some Jedi I am.

22:28.805 --> 22:31.183
Hmm. I heard.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.977
A selfless choice you made, Kai.

22:33.977 --> 22:37.939
You helped others.
That is the way of the Jedi.

22:38.482 --> 22:40.984
Something for you, I have.

22:42.903 --> 22:47.157
This was my training lightsaber
when I was your age.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.910
Yours now, it is.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.332
Thank you, Master Yoda.

22:55.332 --> 22:59.086
Mmm. Proud of you, I am, Kai Brightstar.

22:59.586 --> 23:02.798
A great Jedi you will one day be.
