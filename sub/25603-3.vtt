did to Dolls,</i>

Dolls!!!

00:23.699 --> 00:26.288
- He's not breathin'.
- He's gone, Wynonna.

00:26.747 --> 00:28.802
How is he lying here?!

01:00.970 --> 01:02.567
Bulshar!!!

01:03.235 --> 01:04.656
Are we gonna go get her?

01:04.733 --> 01:06.132
Give her five more minutes.

01:06.209 --> 01:08.271
Well, what happens
if Bulshar does show?

01:08.348 --> 01:11.047
Then my money's on the
grief-stricken demon killer.

01:11.124 --> 01:12.343
Oh, the one who's
so hammered

01:12.420 --> 01:13.561
she can barely walk?

01:13.638 --> 01:16.858
She's got Peacemaker.
And us.

01:17.328 --> 01:21.795
- Yeah, thank God for that.

01:26.312 --> 01:28.335
No, you're right.

01:28.412 --> 01:30.977
Bulshar wouldn't give her
the satisfaction of coming.

01:31.054 --> 01:33.461
- She's got company.
- Dammit! Wynonna!

01:33.538 --> 01:34.693
Okay.

01:35.298 --> 01:37.241
Wynonna Earp.

01:39.320 --> 01:41.037
Not the prick
I was looking for

01:41.114 --> 01:43.191
but... a prick nonetheless.

01:43.268 --> 01:45.304
That's what
my first wife said.

01:45.542 --> 01:46.846
And I killed her for it.

01:46.923 --> 01:48.361
Didn't think you'd be here.

01:48.438 --> 01:49.944
Where else would I be?

01:50.021 --> 01:51.412
Planning a funeral.

01:53.793 --> 01:55.300
Ah! Oh. Oh...

01:55.719 --> 01:57.747
They said you'd shoot
me on first sight.

01:57.824 --> 01:59.618
But it was worth it
to see your pain.

01:59.695 --> 02:00.807
Shut up.

02:01.096 --> 02:03.365
Bulshar got one of yours,

02:03.549 --> 02:04.641
which means

02:04.718 --> 02:06.822
my side, the revenants,

02:06.899 --> 02:08.752
finally got a win.

02:08.830 --> 02:11.681
I was hoping no one else
would have to die today.

02:11.758 --> 02:13.151
We can make it you.

02:13.356 --> 02:15.549
I aim to please.

02:19.433 --> 02:21.238
I'm too tired to kill you.

02:21.943 --> 02:23.008
Oh!

02:23.085 --> 02:25.921
- That makes one of us.
- Bitches!

02:27.422 --> 02:28.867
Yeah, you better run!

02:28.944 --> 02:31.710
You shot him right in the dick?

02:31.787 --> 02:33.766
That was really sweet.

02:36.559 --> 02:38.201
Right, that settles it, okay?

02:38.278 --> 02:40.238
No one's going anywhere
alone for a while.

02:40.315 --> 02:42.786
Not... not until we...

02:42.863 --> 02:44.609
Until we say goodbye.

02:45.075 --> 02:48.274

So shall we call a truce
for now?

03:21.461 --> 03:23.279
Last time we met,

03:23.724 --> 03:26.659
you had me tied
to a stripper pole.

03:26.736 --> 03:28.880
You used to like that kind of thing.

03:29.564 --> 03:31.829
And if we're keeping
score, you shot me.

03:31.906 --> 03:33.725
Well, you did not die.

03:35.906 --> 03:37.089
But he did.

03:37.166 --> 03:38.272
The cards spoke
to me about

03:38.349 --> 03:39.725
the death of
a great warrior.

03:39.952 --> 03:41.186
I'm sorry.

03:41.299 --> 03:44.607
That is not for you
to apologize for.

03:44.881 --> 03:46.228
I can tell you
where he's gone.

03:46.305 --> 03:47.360
I know
where he is.

03:47.437 --> 03:49.802
Xavier Dolls was a good man,
and now

03:49.955 --> 03:51.243
he is at peace.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.552
Yes, well,
peace is for heroes.

03:54.736 --> 03:56.933
And my hero,
the one who took down

03:57.010 --> 03:59.068
your vampire kin,
she's hurtin'.

03:59.486 --> 04:01.990
She's the one
that needs my help.

04:05.353 --> 04:08.662
The man who died, the marshal?
Wynonna loved him too.

04:08.744 --> 04:10.633
You might as well stop
chasing that girl.

04:10.710 --> 04:11.952
You'd be competing
with a ghost

04:12.029 --> 04:13.251
for the rest
of your days.

04:13.328 --> 04:14.938
- Get out.
- Never ends well.

04:15.015 --> 04:16.826
I said get out,
Countessa!

04:21.188 --> 04:23.190
What do you want from me?

04:23.869 --> 04:26.208
I just want you
to say my name.

04:27.861 --> 04:30.642
But if not that,
can I meet your friends?

04:30.719 --> 04:33.997
- Absolutely not.
<i>- C'est la vie.</i>

04:34.408 --> 04:36.763
We always
did have terrible timing.

04:37.346 --> 04:41.169
No.
We were just terrible.

04:42.304 --> 04:44.487
Oak is a more traditional choice,

04:44.564 --> 04:46.243
but our poplar is locally sourced.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.355
So much money for
a box he'll never see.

04:48.432 --> 04:49.774
Yeah, I'm not having a casket.

04:49.851 --> 04:52.227
- What? You're not?
- It's good to have a plan,

04:52.304 --> 04:54.872
to discuss your final
wishes with your husbands.

04:55.135 --> 04:57.552
Yeah, that's right, baby.
It is...

04:57.664 --> 04:59.521
so important.

05:00.619 --> 05:02.969
So... what do you want?

05:03.228 --> 05:04.952
I want a sky funeral.

05:05.029 --> 05:07.339
They put your corpse
up on a scaffold

05:07.416 --> 05:08.681
in the middle of
the wilderness,

05:08.758 --> 05:11.587
attracting crows and
magpies, vultures...

05:11.664 --> 05:12.744
Vultures.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.954
They devour you,
piece by piece,

05:15.031 --> 05:17.212
and then eventually they, um,

05:17.289 --> 05:20.787
dispatch your remains
back over the land.

05:21.228 --> 05:25.179
Wow. That's, uh, very... graphic.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.571
And ecologically conscious.

05:28.838 --> 05:32.230
Well, I haven't really thought
about when I... if I...

05:32.307 --> 05:34.435
Well, there's not much
"if" to it, dear.

05:34.517 --> 05:38.099
I... guess I'll be buried with...
with Willa and Dad.

05:38.260 --> 05:41.208
Ooh, this is awkward.

05:41.392 --> 05:43.313
Ward only purchased
two additional

05:43.390 --> 05:44.706
spaces in the
Earp family plot,

05:44.783 --> 05:46.579
beyond his own and Willa's:
one earmarked

05:46.656 --> 05:48.006
for your mother,

05:48.083 --> 05:49.744
and...

05:50.135 --> 05:52.841
one for your other sister,
Wynonna.

05:52.938 --> 05:54.092
Oh.

05:58.182 --> 06:00.747
Yeah, I'm not doing him,
or this.

06:00.824 --> 06:02.088
Wynonna...

06:02.346 --> 06:04.642
I don't... I have no idea
what Dolls would want.

06:04.719 --> 06:06.079
You were his best friend.

06:06.156 --> 06:08.702
- Oh, is that what I was?
- Stop.

06:08.779 --> 06:10.509
Look, these decisions are
important.

06:10.586 --> 06:11.883
Yeah, I know.

06:11.960 --> 06:15.519
But the thing about
death, you know, is it's forever.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.642
You know? So there's plenty of time.

06:17.924 --> 06:19.789
All the time in the world.

06:32.978 --> 06:35.011
Finally planting
your left foot, I see.

06:36.291 --> 06:39.324
More like I stepped in a frozen
cow patty and I'm kinda stuck.

06:39.401 --> 06:40.958
Looks good on ya.

06:41.713 --> 06:44.390
I will never tire of this view.

06:44.467 --> 06:46.349
I know I'm supposed
to face the facts.

06:46.439 --> 06:48.880
I mean,
I've done all of this before.

06:48.957 --> 06:51.130
With Daddy and Shorty, Willa.

06:51.207 --> 06:52.548
Twice.

06:52.932 --> 06:54.458
Willa twice.

06:57.603 --> 06:59.421
This one's quite a kick in the box.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.913
Yes, ma'am.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.001
I still don't understand
what happened to him

07:03.078 --> 07:04.497
out there on that ledge.

07:04.574 --> 07:08.263
We were dying, Wynonna,
and Dolls, he saved us.

07:08.439 --> 07:10.705
Oh, love.

07:12.643 --> 07:14.536
Oh, love...

07:16.322 --> 07:19.576
Sometimes you get and
sometimes you get got.

07:20.470 --> 07:21.710
Back in my day...

07:21.787 --> 07:24.396
Oh, God,
haven't I suffered enough?

07:25.127 --> 07:28.227
Back in my day, gunslingers
that died with their boots on,

07:28.304 --> 07:29.925
they were buried at Boot Hill.

07:30.002 --> 07:32.212
'Course, it was
a flagrant popularity contest.

07:32.289 --> 07:33.558
Cactus Pete, he got in.

07:33.635 --> 07:34.655
He was only called
that

07:34.732 --> 07:36.626
after he got his ass
so full of needles,

07:36.703 --> 07:39.377
that they had to call
in a seamstress and...

07:40.353 --> 07:42.200
But the ritual of it...

07:43.080 --> 07:46.221
Setting a man's horse
loose to run.

07:47.064 --> 07:50.042
Placing a fine bottle of
whisky on his grave...

07:50.950 --> 07:52.775
That sounds kinda nice.

07:53.080 --> 07:56.017
Whisky which I would then
steal because good liquor

07:56.094 --> 07:58.125
should never be wasted
on the dead.

07:58.650 --> 08:00.671
I guess
death was cheap back then.

08:00.748 --> 08:03.074
It was never cheap.

08:05.769 --> 08:07.641
We need to get Bulshar.

08:11.002 --> 08:13.591
We need to do right
by Dolls first.

08:18.861 --> 08:21.048
D'you know he was from Arizona?

08:23.174 --> 08:25.412
Does he want us
to take him back there?

08:25.713 --> 08:28.474
I figure he chose his family
and we're it.

08:28.752 --> 08:30.208
We're all of it.

08:30.568 --> 08:32.405
Poor asshole.

09:02.010 --> 09:03.755
No, it's...
it's inappropriate,

09:03.832 --> 09:05.721
or, you know,
disrespectful.

09:05.803 --> 09:07.076
It is necessary.

09:07.153 --> 09:09.218
When a man dies,
he should be celebrated.

09:09.295 --> 09:12.015
- But Dolls didn't even drink!
- Yeah, well, we need to.

09:12.108 --> 09:13.411
I think Doc's right.

09:13.488 --> 09:14.854
I think a wake would be nice.

09:14.931 --> 09:17.383
Okay, fine.
I'll make sandwiches.

09:17.460 --> 09:19.539
Pastrami, salami,
egg, tuna, cucumber,

09:19.616 --> 09:21.130
ham-and-cheese,
ham, ham no cheese...

09:21.207 --> 09:24.174
Waves, we don't need
sandwiches for an army, okay?

09:24.251 --> 09:25.841
Dolls had five friends.

09:26.374 --> 09:27.896
Four of them are right here.

09:27.973 --> 09:31.008
But I'm starving. Aren't you?
My God.

09:31.085 --> 09:33.880
Is it wrong to be this hungry
when Dolls will never eat again?

09:33.957 --> 09:36.484
Oh, my God,
why can't I stop giggling?

09:36.561 --> 09:37.748
Now who's inappropriate?

09:37.825 --> 09:39.062
Okay... hey.

09:39.139 --> 09:40.560
I'm sorry,
should I be more like you?

09:40.637 --> 09:43.177
Yeah, rigid and unfeeling when
our friend is in the morgue

09:43.254 --> 09:46.338
and the big dead guy who had
him killed is still out there!

09:50.060 --> 09:52.267
Is that enough feeling for you?

09:56.038 --> 09:59.760
I'll make sure that
there's enough libations at Shorty's

09:59.936 --> 10:02.635
to fortify us through this.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.705
What do we do now?

10:18.976 --> 10:20.312
Haught?

10:21.818 --> 10:23.085
Um...

10:24.616 --> 10:27.295
Uh, maybe we could go
to Dolls's motel room

10:27.372 --> 10:29.953
and... find something
for him to wear.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.697
- Well, how do we get in?
- I've got a key.

10:33.710 --> 10:36.073
We had a professional kind of trust.

10:36.194 --> 10:38.552
Officers in the line of duty.

10:42.741 --> 10:44.156
She said duty.

10:44.233 --> 10:46.338
Yeah, she sure did, cutie.

10:48.305 --> 10:49.359
We can go.

10:49.436 --> 10:51.615
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
Um, we got this.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.505
I don't even know
where Dolls... is.

10:54.838 --> 10:57.281
- Jeremy's doing the autopsy.
- What?!

10:57.358 --> 10:59.525
It's routine in these
circumstances, Wynonna.

10:59.602 --> 11:01.708
He's not cutting him up!
No way.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.256
No way!

11:07.092 --> 11:08.844
A break-in.

11:09.811 --> 11:12.471
Do people not have any
goddamn respect?!

11:15.366 --> 11:18.373
All they seem to have lifted
is the banana liqueur.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.243
Howdy, pardner.

11:38.702 --> 11:41.904
- Yeah, hiya.
- Back for more banana liqueur?

11:41.981 --> 11:44.877
A generous yet...
baffling offer.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.037
I did just get off a bus
and could do with a beer,

11:47.114 --> 11:49.193
but instead I find myself
being held at gunpoint

11:49.270 --> 11:51.357
by a guy with a seriously
committed moustache.

11:51.434 --> 11:53.810
Yeah, and you, sir,
have also drawn on me.

11:53.887 --> 11:57.888
Thus we seem to have ourselves
a classic Mexican standoff.

11:57.965 --> 12:01.947
It's not PC to qualify it
specifically as Mexican anymore.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.437
Yeah, well, the bar is closed,
and will remain closed

12:05.514 --> 12:07.662
for the rest of the afternoon.
We're holding a wake.

12:07.739 --> 12:11.057
For Sergeant Xavier Dolls. I know.
That's why I'm here.

12:11.342 --> 12:12.648
I'm a friend.

12:12.725 --> 12:15.000
Yeah, well, you better
have proof, friend,

12:15.077 --> 12:16.455
'cause I've got one
in the chamber...

12:17.608 --> 12:19.838
and murder on my mind.

12:22.014 --> 12:24.670
I've seen monks with more shit.

12:24.747 --> 12:27.752
Yeah, well, Dolls was
an enigmatic dude.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.577
And a cop.

12:30.342 --> 12:32.105
You guys got each other.

12:32.522 --> 12:33.783
That's really nice.

12:33.866 --> 12:36.088
Well, he had a traumatic past.

12:36.467 --> 12:39.007
He did? What, with Black Badge?

12:39.084 --> 12:41.604
So he felt like
he could help me with my own.

12:42.499 --> 12:46.096
Nicole? Hey, what...
what happened?

12:48.895 --> 12:50.729
I was just a kid.

12:50.832 --> 12:52.436
Um...

12:53.139 --> 12:57.383
My parents were travelling
again and they told me

12:57.460 --> 13:00.463
I could go to this music
festival with my aunt and uncle.

13:01.202 --> 13:02.291
Here.

13:03.348 --> 13:05.154
In the Ghost River Triangle?

13:05.231 --> 13:06.877
There was an attack.

13:06.983 --> 13:08.754
A man in leather.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.119
So much screaming and blood.

13:11.411 --> 13:14.291
The demon Dolls killed at the cliff?

13:14.499 --> 13:16.135
Bondage Bob?

13:17.795 --> 13:20.140
For years, my parents just told me

13:20.217 --> 13:22.463
that everybody died
in a forest fire,

13:22.764 --> 13:25.518
and that I had... I had
somehow escaped, but...

13:26.241 --> 13:28.630
you know, it just didn't
explain the nightmares.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.370
Yeah, I've...

13:30.968 --> 13:32.536
I've heard them.

13:32.685 --> 13:36.247
Last spring, when... Widow
Mercedes said his name...

13:37.632 --> 13:39.064
Bulshar...

13:40.030 --> 13:42.658
it was like this shotgun
went off in my head.

13:42.764 --> 13:45.318
And Dolls helped me.
He got me files,

13:45.395 --> 13:47.158
he... he told me that...

13:47.358 --> 13:50.341
Black Badge had been covering
up these massacres for years.

13:50.418 --> 13:52.072
The Cult of Bulshar.

13:52.642 --> 13:54.833
Oh, Nicole...

13:55.795 --> 13:58.345
I somehow got myself down
to the river and then...

13:59.132 --> 14:01.086
then somebody saved me...

14:03.129 --> 14:05.102
But I couldn't save Dolls.

14:07.272 --> 14:10.811
- None of us could.
- And he was trying to help me,

14:10.888 --> 14:12.398
and now he's dead.

14:12.475 --> 14:14.091
This is all my fault.

14:14.168 --> 14:16.111
Oh, shhh. Hey.

14:17.749 --> 14:19.865
Shhh. It's okay.

14:20.810 --> 14:22.295
You're safe.

14:23.264 --> 14:25.292
We can find out more, okay?

14:25.530 --> 14:27.093
If you want to.

14:27.877 --> 14:30.510
But, of course,
this is not your fault.

14:30.717 --> 14:32.155
Oh... God.

14:32.350 --> 14:33.928
Ah, sorry.

14:34.358 --> 14:36.716
- No.
- Today's about Dolls.

14:38.622 --> 14:41.150
We have a lot to do.
Let's finish up.

14:48.858 --> 14:52.041
"To Wynonna.
For when I'm gone."

14:52.944 --> 14:54.116
Chetri?

14:54.764 --> 14:57.052
Jeremy, put that scalpel
down right now.

14:57.129 --> 14:59.385
No scalpel.
Calm down, Wynonna.

14:59.561 --> 15:03.716
- You're not doing an autopsy?
- No, I, uh... I don't need to.

15:04.413 --> 15:08.072
'Cause I knew what was gonna
kill Dolls. So did he.

15:09.327 --> 15:12.088
Dolls knew he was gonna... die?

15:14.697 --> 15:16.005
Did you?

15:17.397 --> 15:20.961
He knew? You knew? How
could you not tell me?

15:21.038 --> 15:22.906
- He didn't want me to.
- I don't care.

15:22.983 --> 15:24.802
It's called loyalty, Jeremy.
Look it up.

15:24.879 --> 15:26.615
I was respecting
Dolls's wishes.

15:26.692 --> 15:29.236
That's as loyal
as it gets, Wynonna.

15:29.397 --> 15:30.912
Do you think this was
easy for me?

15:30.989 --> 15:33.539
I don't care.
If I'd known, I...

15:33.616 --> 15:35.635
There's nothing
you could've done.

15:35.712 --> 15:36.842
I tried.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.127
It was the drugs.
It was Black Badge.

15:42.295 --> 15:44.901
I will never forgive you for this.

15:46.897 --> 15:50.830
I get it. It's easier to blame
me than the dead dragon, right?

15:50.907 --> 15:52.456
How dare you?

15:54.116 --> 15:56.021
Pack up your science shit, Chetri.

15:56.098 --> 15:58.518
You don't get to be a
part of this anymore.

16:03.048 --> 16:04.163
Then Xavier,

16:04.241 --> 16:07.795
he just takes out the rest of them
with just a broken cricket bat!

16:07.872 --> 16:09.730
Never even broke a sweat.

16:10.022 --> 16:11.474
There she is.

16:11.551 --> 16:14.062
Wynonna Earp,
Staff Sergeant Ramon Quinn.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.218
Just "Quinn" is fine.

16:15.295 --> 16:17.099
Quinn is tied to the bar
with twinkly lights.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.380
That was my doing.

16:18.457 --> 16:20.685
You're welcome.
I am not taking any chances.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.697
Mm-mm. But you are taking
all of the whisky.

16:23.999 --> 16:26.578
- Doc, did you know?
- Know about Quinn?

16:26.655 --> 16:30.541
- No, that Dolls knew he was dying.
- Of course he was dying.

16:31.428 --> 16:33.432
His body couldn't take it
anymore.

16:33.920 --> 16:37.619
He's lucky he lasted as long as he did.
Probably by sheer will.

16:37.877 --> 16:40.107
Never saw anyone eat
so much kale by choice.

16:40.184 --> 16:41.509
You knew Dolls?

16:44.177 --> 16:45.791
Better than anyone.

16:47.522 --> 16:49.955
Quinn says there was
no way to save him.

16:50.069 --> 16:52.354
Not without
the Black Badge serum.

16:53.124 --> 16:54.865
And nobody has any of that left.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.142
Oh.

17:01.354 --> 17:06.551
Ah. Ooo-ee, that smack we boosted
from Shorty's is the real deal.

17:06.628 --> 17:08.941
We get as powerful as that
Black Badge agent was,

17:09.018 --> 17:10.866
and we get to kill
the Earp heir!

17:10.943 --> 17:12.098
Yeah.

17:13.237 --> 17:14.886
What's the matter, boss?

17:18.167 --> 17:20.480
Help!!!

17:22.265 --> 17:24.058
It's impossible

17:24.606 --> 17:25.834
How did you find us?

17:25.911 --> 17:29.063
Someone posted an ad in the back
of Guns and Glory magazine.

17:29.168 --> 17:30.209
Old-school.

17:30.287 --> 17:33.157
Our money's on Jeremy
placing the ad, after,

17:33.332 --> 17:35.063
at Dolls's request.

17:35.434 --> 17:39.193
It was in code, one our entire
squadron used to send a signal

17:39.270 --> 17:40.996
so we could attend
each other's funerals

17:41.073 --> 17:42.666
without Black Badge showing up.

17:43.137 --> 17:46.359
- Because you were all dying.
- They were, or...

17:47.372 --> 17:49.264
are, all dead.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.695
And isn't that convenient.

17:53.983 --> 17:57.590
Long story short, they
experimented on us.

17:57.731 --> 18:00.746
Our genes mixed with
demon god-knows-what.

18:00.823 --> 18:02.240
To what end?

18:02.317 --> 18:04.136
Turn you all into super soldiers?

18:04.213 --> 18:06.872
I'm no scientist.
I just did what I was told.

18:07.823 --> 18:09.719
And it is not convenient.

18:10.926 --> 18:12.137
It sucks.

18:12.465 --> 18:14.814
I wasn't experimented on
like the rest of them.

18:14.891 --> 18:16.668
Wrong blood type.

18:16.745 --> 18:20.240
You two should know that Dolls
resisted BBD's modifications

18:20.317 --> 18:21.373
as long as he could.

18:21.450 --> 18:23.597
Broke out of our facility
and made a run for it

18:23.674 --> 18:25.375
six times in three months.

18:25.864 --> 18:27.753
Never really thought
of Dolls as a rebel.

18:27.830 --> 18:29.553
He was so stubborn.

18:30.516 --> 18:32.332
That's probably why he
lasted so much longer

18:32.409 --> 18:33.730
than the rest of the guys.

18:33.807 --> 18:36.570
If Dolls knew he was dying,
then why didn't he...

18:36.647 --> 18:39.748
contact BBD,
or go to a doctor or...

18:39.825 --> 18:41.644
anything that could help him?

18:41.801 --> 18:43.734
Maybe he stuck around for you.

18:44.614 --> 18:46.517
No maybe about it.

18:49.375 --> 18:50.842
Quinn?

18:51.536 --> 18:54.320
You can stay for the wake
and then you're gone.

18:55.825 --> 19:00.027
And, buddy, if you try
anything, today of all days...

19:00.104 --> 19:02.813
I'm just here to pay my respects.

19:02.890 --> 19:04.087
I swear.

19:13.234 --> 19:14.711
Watch him.

19:16.125 --> 19:19.053
Really watch him.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.166
What do we do with it?

19:25.243 --> 19:27.101
I'm no mail carrier,
but give it to her?

19:27.178 --> 19:29.459
And why is there only
a letter for Wynonna?

19:30.304 --> 19:31.867
We know why.

19:32.344 --> 19:34.228
- Ah, don't do that.
- What?

19:34.305 --> 19:37.748
Don't give me that sad little
someone-stole-my-new-puppy look.

19:37.825 --> 19:39.189
I don't need pity, Waves.

19:39.266 --> 19:41.601
Well, I'm sorry if it's gonna
take me more than 10 minutes

19:41.678 --> 19:43.734
to digest that my girlfriend
was the only survivor

19:43.811 --> 19:46.285
of a supernatural massacre.

19:48.492 --> 19:49.980
I am sorry.

19:50.261 --> 19:51.461
I am.

19:52.615 --> 19:53.948
And...

19:54.990 --> 19:56.157
And?

19:56.922 --> 19:59.363
And I kind of thought you were normal.

19:59.860 --> 20:00.994
Ouch.

20:01.071 --> 20:03.926
Look, you came back to
Purgatory to be a cop.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.863
- Yeah.
- Right? Which... which means

20:05.940 --> 20:08.173
- it can't be a coincidence.
- Probably not.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.468
Which means none of us have
any free will over our lives,

20:10.545 --> 20:12.882
and then we're all gonna die
anyway, so what's the point?

20:12.959 --> 20:15.980
The point is
that I love you.

20:21.743 --> 20:25.703
And if that's our destiny,
then I am pretty darned stoked.

20:25.780 --> 20:29.191
- Just try not to die, okay?
- Okay, yeah. Ditto.

20:29.515 --> 20:32.777
Now don't you have way too
many sandwiches to make?

20:33.885 --> 20:35.137
Yes.

20:35.743 --> 20:38.926
Someone's at the window.
We're three floors up.

20:39.657 --> 20:41.978
- Who is it?!
- Some hot Goth?

20:42.055 --> 20:44.031
Demon? Vampire? Big Bauhaus fan?

20:44.108 --> 20:45.210
Call me Katalin.

20:45.287 --> 20:48.235
Oh! Nicole! She's got my purse! Quick!

20:48.312 --> 20:49.632
- Come on!
- Oh!

20:49.709 --> 20:51.493
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

20:51.570 --> 20:53.155
- Hey, are you okay?
- Oh.

20:53.232 --> 20:56.034
Come here.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry!

20:56.773 --> 20:58.546
Well, she moves pretty
fast for a hot chick.

20:58.623 --> 21:00.688
Okay, you called her hot twice now.

21:00.765 --> 21:02.641
Oh, my God. This is...

21:02.718 --> 21:04.538
this is the worst thing
I've done since...

21:04.615 --> 21:05.594
Champ?

21:05.672 --> 21:08.027
Nicole, Dolls's letter
to Wynonna was in there!

21:08.164 --> 21:10.124
- We can't be late to the wake.
- Wait.

21:10.201 --> 21:12.806
Katalin?
No, she can't be.

21:12.883 --> 21:16.186
- Can't be what?
- Can't... be late to the wake.

21:16.263 --> 21:18.295
C'mon! Let's go.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.079
I was just, uh...

21:28.982 --> 21:32.613
I was just making sure no one...
messed with him, just in case.

21:32.690 --> 21:34.080
Could've asked Lonnie to do it.

21:34.157 --> 21:36.844
Yeah, Lonnie got eaten by vampires.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.216
Oh.

21:39.989 --> 21:41.664
Well, aren't I an asshole.

21:41.989 --> 21:45.004
You know, I used to think
Deputy Marshall Dolls was too.

21:45.081 --> 21:48.438
But, you know, the more
and more I see that...

21:48.841 --> 21:52.508
protecting the world, maybe that
requires a bit of selfishness.

21:53.184 --> 21:55.492
You should be at the wake,
Wynonna.

21:57.894 --> 21:59.482
He was one of us,

21:59.559 --> 22:02.656
and until I can figure out
what to do with his body...

22:08.785 --> 22:11.508
And I'll be here until you do.

22:14.245 --> 22:15.914
Thanks, Nedley.

Doc! Hey, hi.

22:57.012 --> 22:59.699
Waverly, these sandwiches,
they are simply delicious.

22:59.776 --> 23:02.998
- Thanks. Listen...
- No, please, if I may:

23:03.075 --> 23:06.049
I wanna apologize for
my behaviour earlier.

23:06.126 --> 23:08.656
Grief gives rise
to much confession.

23:08.973 --> 23:12.115
- Shakespeare?
- Kendrick Lamar. Listen...

23:12.192 --> 23:14.764
Waverly, my last
conversation with Dolls...

23:15.043 --> 23:16.547
What happened?

23:17.044 --> 23:19.445
I told him
we were destined for hell.

23:19.778 --> 23:22.097
Doc, why would you say
something like that?

23:22.174 --> 23:23.539
Because I am.

23:23.669 --> 23:25.961
Because I've been there.
I went there.

23:26.116 --> 23:29.582
When Dolls shot me, when I died.
And I will return

23:29.659 --> 23:32.354
when it's my turn to be toasted.

23:32.465 --> 23:36.050
I am so, so, so sorry about
what happened to you,

23:36.127 --> 23:38.050
but I need your help.

23:38.127 --> 23:39.692
Here. Now.

23:40.088 --> 23:41.483
Okay.

23:42.145 --> 23:44.426
Dolls left something for Wynonna,

23:44.503 --> 23:47.310
a letter, and a sneaky, but yes,

23:47.387 --> 23:50.691
okay, fine, total smoke show
with the perfect purple pout

23:50.768 --> 23:53.485
snatched it and... disappeared.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.735
Called herself Katalin?

23:55.843 --> 23:57.682
For God's sakes.

23:57.997 --> 24:00.149
I think I know who your thief is.

24:00.255 --> 24:01.542
Thought you might.

24:01.619 --> 24:05.352
I think it is best if we
keep this on the down-low.

24:05.887 --> 24:07.451
Gotcha.

24:17.208 --> 24:20.386
Yorkie. No one could understand
a word he was saying,

24:20.463 --> 24:22.352
but he was a crack shot.

24:22.434 --> 24:24.988
Burbs, he actually...
he got drafted into the Majors,

24:25.065 --> 24:26.461
but joined up instead.

24:26.645 --> 24:28.136
Ah, Jingles.

24:28.213 --> 24:32.813
Jingles. And Burb.
You got any Johns or Richards?

24:32.911 --> 24:34.664
Nicknames are bonding.

24:34.965 --> 24:38.637
I never even knew Burb's real
name until I went to his funeral.

24:39.051 --> 24:41.301
- It was John-Richard.
- Okay.

24:42.700 --> 24:46.074
Our squad's less nickname-y, more
"Hey, dingus, pass me some bullets,"

24:46.151 --> 24:48.597
but we've always got
each other's backs.

24:48.674 --> 24:50.287
Who had Dolls's back?

24:52.309 --> 24:53.671
Sorry.

24:54.950 --> 24:57.047
- Ah, you're drunk.
- Mm.

24:57.771 --> 25:00.027
And the last one standing.

25:00.864 --> 25:02.566
You know, every night
I lay down in bed,

25:02.643 --> 25:04.488
I say their names over and over.

25:04.565 --> 25:06.263
Everyone who died on my watch.

25:06.340 --> 25:09.203
The job's hard enough.
Why torture yourself? I don't.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.785
I have tried to leave
Black Badge behind.

25:11.862 --> 25:13.672
Good, 'cause they're gone.

25:14.051 --> 25:15.586
What if they're not?

25:17.192 --> 25:19.156
They put a lot of money into us.

25:19.739 --> 25:21.039
Into him.

25:21.552 --> 25:23.410
Think they're just gonna let him be?

25:23.487 --> 25:27.086
You think they'd come for what's...
left of Dolls?

25:27.520 --> 25:31.297
I think there's a reason the rest
of my friends' graves are unmarked.

25:39.762 --> 25:42.836
- Oh. Hey.
- Hey, Nicole.

25:43.130 --> 25:45.847
If you're looking for Waverly and
Doc, they just left out the back.

25:45.924 --> 25:50.164
No, I am looking for
more vodkee, actually.

25:52.224 --> 25:54.130
What are you doing alone
down here?

25:55.497 --> 25:57.144
You get to say goodbye, too,
Jeremy.

25:57.221 --> 25:59.336
What... happened down here?

25:59.489 --> 26:01.683
Doc said there was a break-in.
Probably some rummies.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.435
Doesn't the timing seem
suspicious?

26:04.027 --> 26:05.842
Well, it's Purgatory.
Last Halloween,

26:05.919 --> 26:07.113
I saw over 20 black cats.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.110
I swear they were all
wearing bow ties.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.748
Shit! Oh, shit!

26:12.825 --> 26:14.902
The drugs Rosita was trying
to replicate for Dolls,

26:14.979 --> 26:16.685
the rejected formulas
that didn't work...

26:16.762 --> 26:18.441
- They're gone?
- Gone like the girl in Gone Girl!

26:18.518 --> 26:21.802
- The movie and the book!
- I'll kill you!!

26:23.340 --> 26:26.610
Give us the Earp heir and
the rest of you can live.

26:26.687 --> 26:29.629
Screw that.
You're all going down!

26:29.706 --> 26:31.719
- Demons?
- Revenants.

26:31.801 --> 26:33.950
And they're jacked up to shit.

26:39.344 --> 26:41.483
- Ah!!
- C'mere!

26:46.713 --> 26:48.693
- Argh!
- Uh!

26:49.466 --> 26:50.782
My bad.

26:58.928 --> 27:00.844
This is a memorial, dipshit.

27:01.145 --> 27:02.781
D'you even bring a casserole?

27:03.121 --> 27:04.799
Ah!

27:08.389 --> 27:10.719
- <i>What the hell?</i>!
- Got another one!

27:10.847 --> 27:12.461
Suck hell, revhead.

27:20.852 --> 27:21.966
Ah!!

27:24.430 --> 27:26.006
No sale.

27:38.406 --> 27:39.437
<i>Hi.</i>

27:39.551 --> 27:41.568
<i>Yeah, hey,
where the hell are you?</i>

27:41.645 --> 27:42.948
And why d'you answer
Doc's phone?

27:43.025 --> 27:45.125
Doc shoved it at me
when he saw it was you.

27:45.265 --> 27:46.480
We have to run an errand.

27:46.557 --> 27:48.378
An errand in the middle of a wake?

27:48.455 --> 27:50.862
We'll be back in two shakes.
Why? What's up?

27:50.939 --> 27:53.601
Well.

27:57.689 --> 28:00.831
- Officer Fire Crotch.
- Demon Blown-off Balls.

28:00.908 --> 28:02.171
- Yah!
- Oh.

28:02.746 --> 28:04.855
You smell
like banana liqueur!

28:04.932 --> 28:06.043
Ah!

28:06.332 --> 28:07.392
Ah!!

28:09.569 --> 28:11.934
And you thought getting
wang-shot sucked?

28:13.512 --> 28:16.042
Some revenants got into the lizard
drugs Jeremy made for Dolls,

28:16.119 --> 28:18.625
but no, yeah,
please, take your time.

28:19.895 --> 28:21.082
Bye.

28:23.106 --> 28:27.125
- Is Wynonna okay?
- Well, we probably shouldn't dally.

28:28.043 --> 28:30.706
And we're back at
the Gardner House.

28:30.783 --> 28:33.734
What the hell was that?
What were they?

28:34.074 --> 28:37.083
Three paranormal tours with
BBD but this Fs with your S?

28:37.160 --> 28:39.307
It's not the attack.
It's not the demons.

28:39.384 --> 28:40.348
Revenants.

28:40.426 --> 28:42.511
It's that you civilians had
access to Black Badge drugs.

28:42.588 --> 28:44.003
We didn't have access to them.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.177
We synthesized them.

28:45.254 --> 28:47.480
So Dolls wouldn't have to
depend on Black Badge to live.

28:47.557 --> 28:50.527
- You can do that?
- Not me. Our narc can.

28:50.809 --> 28:52.684
He flew me into a cash register.

28:52.761 --> 28:54.036
That's Agent Chetri.

28:54.113 --> 28:56.316
He's a Black Badge scientist.
What the hell's he doing here?

28:56.393 --> 28:59.472
F-ing with my S.
He was trying to keep Dolls alive.

28:59.549 --> 29:01.632
Hmm. Talk about a fail.

29:02.517 --> 29:06.578
I, uh, I'm gonna go back to the office
and log what's left of the serum.

29:06.817 --> 29:09.343
Make sure none of it got stolen.
Sounds like a plan.

29:12.928 --> 29:14.896
- Look, Holliday...
- Holliday?

29:14.973 --> 29:18.483
Can you just tell me who she is?
I mean, I have a hunch.

29:18.629 --> 29:20.636
Many sweet autumn moons ago...

29:20.713 --> 29:21.820
Okay, Doc.

29:22.113 --> 29:23.682
She's my wife.

29:25.881 --> 29:29.687
Does anyone around here
not have a secret wife?

29:33.710 --> 29:36.180
Just come in already.

29:46.199 --> 29:47.577
Countessa.

29:47.684 --> 29:50.388
- Doc.
- Oh, are we doing introductions?

29:50.465 --> 29:54.357
Great. Hi! I'm Waverly Earp, and
you're squatting on Gardner land,

29:54.434 --> 29:56.542
and you took something that
belongs to my dead friend Dolls,

29:56.619 --> 29:58.578
which is shitty and tacky!

29:59.176 --> 30:02.112
- And you want it back?
- And I want it back!!

30:05.823 --> 30:07.505
Temperance.

30:07.582 --> 30:09.021
The angel card.

30:09.098 --> 30:11.300
Balance and moderation.

30:11.395 --> 30:13.187
But it's upside down.

30:13.301 --> 30:14.839
Lack of long-term vision.

30:14.916 --> 30:17.972
Hmm. Is she always
such a snoozie boots?

30:18.049 --> 30:19.035
Hey.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.651
Ah!

30:23.168 --> 30:24.231
Ah!

30:24.723 --> 30:27.554
Give the envelope back, or
next time I bring a stake.

30:32.630 --> 30:34.536
I thank you very much.

30:35.996 --> 30:37.753
- Did you open it?
- Of course not.

30:37.830 --> 30:39.765
I'm a vampire, not an asshole.

30:40.426 --> 30:42.161
I just wanted an invitation.

30:42.238 --> 30:43.495
Well, then like a few selfies

30:43.572 --> 30:45.968
and slide into my DMs
like a normal person.

30:46.430 --> 30:48.436
- If I may...
- No, you may not!

30:48.559 --> 30:50.961
So you slept with Doc.
Who hasn't?!

30:51.629 --> 30:56.807
Okay, not me, but the point
is, someone we love is dead!

30:56.973 --> 31:00.237
If we're all destined to be here
and we're all gonna die here,

31:00.314 --> 31:03.703
we need to figure out how to be here...
together.

31:10.441 --> 31:12.101
I get it now.

31:12.178 --> 31:16.054
The little one... so fiery.

31:17.183 --> 31:18.945
Just like Wyatt.

31:20.955 --> 31:23.242
Waverly is not even an Earp.

31:32.461 --> 31:34.679
She's something alright.

31:41.058 --> 31:42.463
That's not for you.

31:43.159 --> 31:45.749
- Okay.
- And neither is this wake.

31:46.456 --> 31:48.192
Are you really gonna
do this right now?

31:48.269 --> 31:50.868
Tough-love you back to your senses?
Feels like about that time.

31:50.945 --> 31:52.308
A man I...

31:53.253 --> 31:54.770
Someone I love is dead.

31:54.847 --> 31:57.233
You're not the only one
who lost him.

31:58.143 --> 32:00.952
You don't get a monopoly
over the grief we all feel.

32:02.596 --> 32:03.963
Hey.

32:06.824 --> 32:08.153
I'm sorry.

32:08.519 --> 32:10.061
You don't have to be, Earp.

32:10.558 --> 32:13.869
I know you'd rather be angry than
what you're feeling right now.

32:13.946 --> 32:14.972
Ahem.

32:15.683 --> 32:18.311
I told Jeremy to pack up
his things and leave.

32:18.527 --> 32:21.281
Well, then you better go
make sure he doesn't.

32:31.209 --> 32:33.854
And I shouldn't have called
you a traitorous nerdling

32:33.931 --> 32:37.033
when I know a deception dweeb is
less harsh and more accurate.

32:42.157 --> 32:44.963
- Stay out of this, Wynonna.
- What are you doing, Quinn?

32:45.040 --> 32:47.532
Bad stuff! With my good stapler!

32:48.402 --> 32:50.897
I need him to tell me where
he's hiding the drugs.

32:52.033 --> 32:55.590
Alright, we can find them together.
But let Jeremy go.

32:55.667 --> 32:59.093
- He's a Black Badge lackey.
- They did stuff to me too, you know!

32:59.308 --> 33:00.989
He's just a good soldier, like you.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.377
Just following orders? You
don't trust him either.

33:03.454 --> 33:04.673
Actually, I do.

33:04.761 --> 33:06.882
He is what's left of Black Badge,

33:07.183 --> 33:08.575
and they...

33:08.839 --> 33:10.721
are gonna pay for what
they did to Dolls.

33:10.798 --> 33:14.280
- I get it, I really do.
- And not just Dolls.

33:14.417 --> 33:15.582
Jingles,

33:15.863 --> 33:17.037
Yorkie,

33:17.534 --> 33:18.534
Eliza.

33:18.636 --> 33:20.973
Yeah. Eliza.

33:21.683 --> 33:23.205
What's the end game here, Quinn?

33:23.282 --> 33:26.018
I inject myself with Agent
Chetri's bootleg BBD drugs

33:26.095 --> 33:27.661
and storm Black Badge HQ.

33:27.738 --> 33:29.635
You saw what the drugs did
to the revenants, right?

33:29.712 --> 33:32.374
- It doesn't work!
- Ah!!!

33:34.878 --> 33:36.464
Avenge the squadron.

33:37.144 --> 33:38.776
Go out in a blaze of glory.

33:38.894 --> 33:40.082
If that's what it takes.

33:40.159 --> 33:43.343
The only thing that matters is
doing right by the people I hurt.

33:43.886 --> 33:45.632
What people you hurt?

33:45.784 --> 33:48.457
Every time Dolls escaped Black
Badge custody as a kid,

33:48.534 --> 33:50.338
who do you think it was
who brought him back?

33:50.415 --> 33:52.739
Over and over,
even when he begged,

33:52.816 --> 33:54.804
because those were my orders.

33:57.355 --> 34:00.639
I'm gonna put the gun...
and the beer down.

34:06.662 --> 34:08.097
Fish.

34:09.284 --> 34:11.262
Levi. Shorty.

34:11.339 --> 34:12.606
Yeah, Eliza.

34:12.683 --> 34:15.045
- Stop. Stop.
- My sister, Willa.

34:15.831 --> 34:18.545
My own father. Dolls.

34:18.902 --> 34:20.746
I lied when I said I don't...

34:21.487 --> 34:23.601
I don't torture myself
with their names.

34:23.679 --> 34:25.655
We all have a trail of ghosts.

34:26.199 --> 34:29.210
And a list of enemies
we want to get revenge on.

34:29.339 --> 34:32.824
But they kill ours and
we get some of theirs.

34:32.902 --> 34:34.219
And on and on...

34:35.010 --> 34:36.889
until the end of time.

34:38.120 --> 34:41.228
Going kamikaze isn't...
gonna bring them back.

34:41.306 --> 34:42.983
No matter what we do,

34:43.175 --> 34:44.764
they're still dead.

34:44.869 --> 34:47.030
So what am I supposed
to do?

34:47.699 --> 34:48.893
Live.

34:55.463 --> 34:57.684
Let it go... Quinn.

34:58.753 --> 35:00.827
Dolls wouldn't want this for you.

35:00.904 --> 35:02.272
Or for him.

35:13.777 --> 35:15.488
Oh, God!

35:16.300 --> 35:17.980
Oh, shit.

35:21.223 --> 35:22.607
Thanks.

35:26.206 --> 35:28.494
Sorry I tried to torture
and kill your friend.

35:28.571 --> 35:30.452
Meh. He can be pretty annoying.

35:30.769 --> 35:31.903
You want to make it up to us,

35:31.980 --> 35:33.823
find out if there's anything
left of Black Badge

35:33.900 --> 35:36.549
and destroy the blood contracts
they made me and my team sign.

35:36.626 --> 35:38.499
Pay a visit to Mr. Moody?

35:39.324 --> 35:41.007
Sounds like my kind of mission.

35:41.206 --> 35:44.489
Quinn. You come back here
for any other reason,

35:44.566 --> 35:46.136
I will personally rearrange you

35:46.213 --> 35:48.382
so that hand tattoo
ends up your ass.

35:48.869 --> 35:50.585
That's fair.

35:52.933 --> 35:54.387
You sure?

35:54.777 --> 35:56.082
Agent...

35:57.683 --> 36:00.335
Sergeant Dolls should
be with his friends.

36:01.595 --> 36:02.832
Thank you.

36:04.995 --> 36:06.465
Wynonna.

36:07.776 --> 36:10.070
Don't let his fire go to waste.

36:40.265 --> 36:42.651
Uh, I just... I just relieved Nedley.

36:43.374 --> 36:44.374
Thanks.

36:44.538 --> 36:46.676
Look, Wynonna, I promise...

36:46.889 --> 36:50.874
all I did was catalogue paranormal
entities and do some IT. I...

36:51.624 --> 36:55.354
I had no idea what Black Badge was
doing to Dolls and his brothers.

36:55.678 --> 36:57.884
Dolls was more than
just his body.

36:58.362 --> 37:00.201
So much more.

37:01.452 --> 37:04.092
But we can't let his
body become currency.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.108
No. Never again.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.701
There's only ever been
one option.

39:01.761 --> 39:03.739
We should do this more often.

39:04.228 --> 39:06.168
It's 20 below out.

39:07.751 --> 39:11.059
But yeah... this is okay. Hmm.

39:11.259 --> 39:12.836
Have you thought
about your own plans

39:12.913 --> 39:15.809
for, um... for when you go?

39:15.954 --> 39:17.286
Go where?

39:18.431 --> 39:19.708
Oh.

39:20.618 --> 39:21.813
Of course.

39:22.603 --> 39:25.341
I don't have a spot in
the Earp burial plot.

39:26.016 --> 39:28.401
Neither of us is ending up in there.

39:28.892 --> 39:30.947
You seen the view
from the graveyard?

39:31.087 --> 39:33.716
I'm not spending eternity
facing my old high school.

39:34.345 --> 39:36.510
So the plan is just to live forever?

39:37.565 --> 39:39.766
Call it 80 more years
and then you and me

39:39.843 --> 39:41.942
will be buried here
on the homestead.

39:42.036 --> 39:43.575
Side by side.

39:45.446 --> 39:47.209
I suppose that'll do.

39:47.867 --> 39:50.230
Don't ask
if Nicole can come too.

39:53.664 --> 39:57.027
You're my favourite person in the
whole wide world, baby girl.

39:57.469 --> 40:00.301
And once we've defeated
Bulshar, you're stuck with me.

40:00.602 --> 40:01.840
Forever.

40:02.273 --> 40:03.376
Okay?

40:08.276 --> 40:09.582
Here.

40:10.155 --> 40:11.195
What's this?

40:11.272 --> 40:14.269
Dolls left it for you. Just you.

40:26.314 --> 40:28.945
Oh, my God,
I remember that day.

40:29.034 --> 40:30.705
What does it mean?

40:32.218 --> 40:33.769
Keep going.

40:34.889 --> 40:36.636
Keep fighting.

40:38.878 --> 40:41.535
Fine.
Nicole can be buried with us.

40:42.453 --> 40:44.390
Nicole wants to be eaten
by vultures

40:44.467 --> 40:45.927
and then pooped out again.

40:46.039 --> 40:47.469
Hard-core.

41:08.875 --> 41:12.226
Is there anything you will
not do to get under my skin?

41:12.303 --> 41:15.457
You're pushing me away.
What choice did I have?

41:17.656 --> 41:20.214
I am truly sorry about
your friend.

41:20.586 --> 41:22.633
Now, I want to believe you.

41:23.570 --> 41:27.160
When I heard that you had
died, I could barely...

41:28.523 --> 41:29.898
And Wyatt.

41:31.562 --> 41:32.773
He didn't.

41:33.039 --> 41:35.230
I heard he lived a good long life.

41:35.461 --> 41:38.108
Moved to Hollywood.
He became a stunt rider.

41:38.594 --> 41:42.527
Yes. He also never
stopped looking for you.

41:43.320 --> 41:46.839
Spent thousands...
hired trackers.

41:48.406 --> 41:50.839
Ultimately it broke
his heart, you know.

41:52.883 --> 41:55.738
Before Wyatt passed,
he did me a kindness.

41:56.547 --> 41:57.993
Told me the truth.

41:58.297 --> 42:00.464
And when I heard that
you had arisen...

42:01.766 --> 42:04.910
- I knew what I had to do.
- And what is that?

42:09.149 --> 42:11.097
Whatever it takes.

42:17.808 --> 42:19.273
One rule.

42:20.867 --> 42:22.652
No teeth, Kate.
