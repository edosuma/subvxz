<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:11.970 --> 00:14.339
I'm tired of fighting.

00:14.374 --> 00:15.841
Me, too.

00:15.875 --> 00:17.709
Carrie knows, right,

00:17.743 --> 00:19.177
everything about you?

00:19.212 --> 00:20.479
She accepts it.

00:20.513 --> 00:23.517
You must love her a lot.

00:23.551 --> 00:26.388
This deal of ours...

00:26.422 --> 00:29.057
I think it's a way out
for both of us.

00:29.091 --> 00:31.026
You know how crazy
everyone says you are?

00:31.060 --> 00:32.729
You're crazier than that.

00:32.762 --> 00:34.598
<i>Not too many
months ago you told me</i>

00:34.632 --> 00:35.766
you were in love with him.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.270
Yeah, and I was more than
a little unstable then.

00:39.305 --> 00:41.039
Carrie's been in an
accident. D.C. Police found

00:41.074 --> 00:43.277
her car on 17th Street all
smashed up; it was broadsided.

00:43.311 --> 00:44.778
- Is she hurt?
- They can't find her.

00:44.813 --> 00:46.347
What the fuck have you done
to Carrie?

00:46.381 --> 00:48.850
If you want to help her, you
will do exactly as I tell you.

00:48.884 --> 00:50.219
Walden has a bad heart.

00:50.253 --> 00:52.788
His pacemaker can
be accessed wirelessly.

00:52.822 --> 00:53.956
Send me the number

00:53.990 --> 00:55.458
or I will kill her.

00:57.561 --> 00:58.961
Call a doctor.

01:00.932 --> 01:02.433
I'm killing you.

01:05.135 --> 01:06.871
<i>What I did</i>

01:06.905 --> 01:10.108
to get Nazir to let you go...

01:10.142 --> 01:12.110
it was you or Walden, Carrie.

01:12.145 --> 01:13.579
What if Nazir didn't run

01:13.613 --> 01:14.880
and we're looking
in all the wrong places?

01:14.915 --> 01:16.148
So, what are the right places?

01:16.183 --> 01:17.316
Back in the tunnels.

01:26.363 --> 01:27.630
I got him.

01:32.470 --> 01:35.138
You tell Estes, no matter
how many bullshit charges

01:35.172 --> 01:37.274
he trumps up, I'm on to him.

01:37.308 --> 01:38.642
You know what
this is really about?

01:38.676 --> 01:40.110
Planning a hit on Brody.

01:40.145 --> 01:42.146
How you going to do on the
polygraph when they ask

01:42.181 --> 01:43.181
if you ever executed a member

01:43.215 --> 01:45.617
<i>of Congress?</i>

01:59.533 --> 02:02.602
Oh, it's all coming back to me.

02:02.636 --> 02:04.203
The good, the bad, the ugly?

02:04.238 --> 02:06.840
It wasn't dull.

02:19.155 --> 02:21.123
Ah, watch the wrists.

02:21.157 --> 02:22.391
Wounded warrior.

02:24.428 --> 02:26.863
It's not like last time, though.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.966
There's no secrets now.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.201
Scary?

02:31.235 --> 02:32.669
No, it's just...

02:32.703 --> 02:34.471
Easier?

02:34.505 --> 02:38.141
Well, that should
be a good thing, right?

02:39.577 --> 02:41.211
Yeah.

02:41.245 --> 02:45.048
Anyway, um, we should get
firewood, make up the bed.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.050
Sure.

03:20.955 --> 03:22.922
Yeah.

03:22.957 --> 03:23.924
You on him?

03:23.958 --> 03:25.792
- Yup.
- And?

03:25.827 --> 03:28.262
He's not alone.

03:28.296 --> 03:29.863
As soon as he is, I'll take him.

03:29.898 --> 03:31.365
And he disappears.

03:31.399 --> 03:34.067
I know what I'm doing.

03:34.102 --> 03:35.068
Who's he with?

03:35.103 --> 03:37.137
Does it matter?

03:37.172 --> 03:38.705
It's Carrie, right?

03:38.739 --> 03:39.906
Yeah.

03:39.940 --> 03:42.375
Jesus, she's unbelievable.

03:42.410 --> 03:44.477
You never made a bad move
in your romantic life?

03:45.512 --> 03:47.647
Call me every two hours.

04:29.723 --> 04:31.957
Uh, do something with these.

04:37.631 --> 04:39.298
Ha, ha.

04:39.332 --> 04:40.466
- I'm funny.
- Well,

04:40.500 --> 04:42.501
now I know.

05:18.071 --> 05:20.272
A souvenir from our last visit.

05:30.249 --> 05:32.251
How sweet.

05:53.139 --> 05:55.107
Hey, let's take a walk.

05:57.143 --> 05:59.111
So you guys own
this place, right?

05:59.145 --> 06:00.546
From my mom's family.

06:00.580 --> 06:03.248
They'd come here every summer.

06:03.283 --> 06:04.950
Where's your mom now?

06:07.487 --> 06:10.288
The day I left for college,

06:10.323 --> 06:13.425
she told my dad she
was going to CVS

06:13.459 --> 06:16.061
and she never came back.

06:16.095 --> 06:19.397
Wow, did you see that coming?

06:19.431 --> 06:22.133
Well, my dad was
pretty impossible.

06:24.470 --> 06:27.639
He has what I have, but he
just wouldn't get treated.

06:27.673 --> 06:29.107
Uh-huh.

06:29.141 --> 06:30.408
So there'd be a
message in the stars,

06:30.443 --> 06:32.077
and he'd have to buy a camper

06:32.111 --> 06:35.113
and drive us all out to the
Great Lakes for the miracle.

06:35.148 --> 06:38.050
It was that kind of thing.

06:38.084 --> 06:39.251
But now he's on meds?

06:39.286 --> 06:40.620
Yeah, and he's good.

06:40.654 --> 06:43.689
He's, he's well.

06:43.723 --> 06:45.692
And your mom?

06:49.764 --> 06:53.467
You'd think I'd hate
her-- Maggie does--

06:53.501 --> 06:55.436
but I understand.

06:55.470 --> 06:58.038
I mean, living with
that can eat you up.

07:00.108 --> 07:02.375
Has she reached out
to you since?

07:05.979 --> 07:10.249
No, that part...
does hurt.

07:13.287 --> 07:15.521
Thanks for telling me.

07:17.558 --> 07:20.160
You're the first one.

07:47.688 --> 07:49.655
Did you call Carrie Mathison?

07:49.690 --> 07:53.159
No, but, uh, got you
an extra milk.

07:53.193 --> 07:54.660
Something terrible
is going down

07:54.694 --> 07:57.362
right now.

07:57.397 --> 07:59.331
An assassination.

07:59.366 --> 08:00.799
You know I got to report
everything

08:00.834 --> 08:01.834
that you say in here, right?

08:01.868 --> 08:04.170
Report it.

08:04.204 --> 08:06.339
Shout it from the rooftops.

08:09.943 --> 08:13.145
Saul, just being honest--
you sound a little nutty.

08:13.179 --> 08:15.681
Would you please
just call Carrie?

08:15.715 --> 08:17.015
You know I can't do that.

08:17.050 --> 08:18.884
Why not?

08:18.918 --> 08:20.552
Why not have a
mind of your own,

08:20.586 --> 08:24.589
do me a favor despite
your fucking orders?

08:24.624 --> 08:26.625
'Cause then I'd be
where you are.

08:33.232 --> 08:35.234
Thanks for the milk.

08:50.249 --> 08:54.453
So, how do I apply
to become your cabin boy?

08:54.487 --> 08:56.021
Oh, that's a coveted spot.

08:56.055 --> 08:58.023
Naturally.

08:58.057 --> 09:01.092
Full-time?

09:01.126 --> 09:02.561
Live-in.

09:02.595 --> 09:05.530
Do the cooking, do the laundry.

09:07.799 --> 09:10.101
I do hate laundry.

09:10.135 --> 09:12.770
Keep the lady of the
house stimulated.

09:12.804 --> 09:13.804
Intellectually.

09:16.341 --> 09:17.641
You're hired.

09:30.656 --> 09:32.657
Want to talk about it for real?

09:35.127 --> 09:37.095
Yeah, okay.

09:39.131 --> 09:41.833
Okay.

09:41.867 --> 09:44.436
Well, what are your plans?

09:44.470 --> 09:46.104
If I don't get
the cabin boy job?

09:46.138 --> 09:48.339
Yeah.

09:48.373 --> 09:50.941
Well...

09:50.976 --> 09:52.409
I'm not going to be
a congressman.

09:52.444 --> 09:55.479
You got any other skills?

09:55.513 --> 09:57.414
Um...

09:57.449 --> 09:59.450
yeah, I could be a builder.

10:00.786 --> 10:03.854
Maybe a teacher.

10:03.889 --> 10:07.825
My only real plan for now
is to be a good person again.

10:07.860 --> 10:09.928
You are a good person.

10:13.165 --> 10:15.733
I really have a second chance.

10:17.169 --> 10:19.170
I never thought
that was possible.

10:19.205 --> 10:21.839
A clean slate.

10:22.875 --> 10:25.210
And I have you.

10:28.147 --> 10:31.749
At least, at this
moment, I have you.

10:37.489 --> 10:40.825
Well, if we were
really serious...

10:40.859 --> 10:43.495
Well, let's just say we are.

10:47.599 --> 10:49.567
I would have
a clean slate, too.

10:49.602 --> 10:52.837
Because you wouldn't
go back to the CIA.

10:52.872 --> 10:54.873
Oh, I couldn't.

10:54.907 --> 10:57.209
And there's the rub.

10:58.244 --> 11:02.514
Well... yes.

11:12.926 --> 11:14.594
They ask you back?

11:14.628 --> 11:18.431
Uh, no, not yet, but...

11:18.465 --> 11:20.867
You know, I know how
much you love it there.

11:20.901 --> 11:23.269
Yeah, but, but the thing is...

11:23.304 --> 11:26.039
- No, I understand, I do.
- No, you interrupted me.

11:26.073 --> 11:28.074
Sorry.

11:32.246 --> 11:35.248
The thing is, Brody...

11:37.085 --> 11:39.053
I also love...

11:39.088 --> 11:41.122
Careful.

11:43.159 --> 11:46.060
...being with you.

11:52.402 --> 11:54.970
Is it possible?

11:56.005 --> 11:58.273
I don't know.

12:01.411 --> 12:05.381
I mean, your past...
and my illness.

12:05.415 --> 12:06.749
I'm not scared of that.

12:06.784 --> 12:09.152
- You should be.
- Why?

12:09.186 --> 12:11.320
I told you, it's hard.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.424
It's ugly.

12:14.458 --> 12:16.626
Well, you're not scared of
the ugly things I've done.

12:16.661 --> 12:18.095
I am, though.

12:20.131 --> 12:22.799
You do scare me, Brody.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.740
Um...

12:32.644 --> 12:35.279
Look...

12:42.587 --> 12:44.921
You might be right.

12:46.925 --> 12:49.293
Maybe all this will end
in tears.

12:55.334 --> 12:57.736
Or...

12:57.770 --> 13:00.939
we might make it?

13:13.754 --> 13:16.122
Mmm.

14:46.882 --> 14:48.215
Don't leave.

14:49.584 --> 14:52.686
I'll be back with croissants.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.021
In that case, get out of here.

17:34.579 --> 17:37.014
Brody?

17:56.735 --> 17:59.137
Brody?

18:11.583 --> 18:12.950
Morning.

18:12.984 --> 18:14.452
Morning.

18:14.486 --> 18:17.889
Real life interferes today.

18:17.923 --> 18:19.758
I know.

18:19.792 --> 18:22.228
Back we go.

18:24.264 --> 18:26.599
I was thinking, in the car...

18:26.633 --> 18:28.234
Yeah?

18:28.268 --> 18:30.236
- About you.
- And?

18:30.270 --> 18:32.639
And me.

18:36.944 --> 18:39.279
It's up to you.

18:39.313 --> 18:41.514
I'm in.

18:46.286 --> 18:49.154
I have to, uh...

18:49.189 --> 18:51.490
- Think?
- Yeah.

18:53.926 --> 18:56.495
I wish I could have both--
you and the job.

18:56.529 --> 18:58.130
- I know.
- But...

18:58.164 --> 19:00.832
I know, I know.

19:00.867 --> 19:03.668
And I'll understand,
whatever you decide.

19:05.672 --> 19:07.906
I'm gonna go
to my sister's tonight,

19:07.941 --> 19:09.641
see them, just play this out.

19:09.676 --> 19:11.543
Sure.

19:20.453 --> 19:22.821
But we <i>could</i> be
happy, couldn't we?

19:29.829 --> 19:31.297
Imagine that.

20:17.010 --> 20:19.378
Shit!

20:27.054 --> 20:29.389
Is it done?

20:29.423 --> 20:31.825
No.

20:34.596 --> 20:37.030
No?

20:39.701 --> 20:42.203
The vice president's dead.

20:42.237 --> 20:44.571
I'm aware.

20:44.606 --> 20:47.007
And Brody's resigning his seat.

20:47.042 --> 20:49.409
You're telling me things I know.

20:49.444 --> 20:51.778
So there's no threat
to the nation.

20:51.813 --> 20:55.049
He'll never rise politically.

20:55.083 --> 20:58.586
Are you suddenly an analyst,
Quinn?

20:58.620 --> 21:01.022
No.

21:01.056 --> 21:03.624
I'm a guy who kills bad guys.

21:03.659 --> 21:06.061
And you have an assignment

21:06.095 --> 21:08.430
you've apparently fucked up.

21:08.464 --> 21:10.399
Brody's information was good.

21:10.433 --> 21:11.901
So fucking what?

21:11.935 --> 21:14.403
Perfect, actually.

21:14.437 --> 21:17.039
We got Nazir because of him.

21:17.073 --> 21:19.408
As for Carrie,

21:19.443 --> 21:22.411
I have never seen a better
intelligence officer.

21:22.445 --> 21:25.682
Killing Brody would kill her.

21:27.451 --> 21:29.252
What is all this
squishy bullshit?

21:29.286 --> 21:32.656
So the only reason
to kill Brody now is for you.

21:32.690 --> 21:35.492
To cover <i>your</i> ass.

21:35.526 --> 21:37.927
And the collateral damage

21:37.962 --> 21:39.429
would be to wreck a woman

21:39.463 --> 21:42.566
you've already wrecked
once before.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.667
And I ain't doing that.

21:47.805 --> 21:49.973
No.

21:50.007 --> 21:53.610
Fine... if you're not up
to the task.

22:01.385 --> 22:03.753
Nothing happens to Brody.

22:03.788 --> 22:05.456
Or?

22:05.490 --> 22:07.524
Or you'll find me back in
this bedroom one night.

22:07.559 --> 22:09.961
Right back in that chair.

22:12.397 --> 22:14.798
'Cause I'm a guy
that kills bad guys.

22:38.088 --> 22:40.489
Hi, Brody.

22:40.523 --> 22:42.124
How's it going?

22:42.158 --> 22:45.461
Um, fine. Fair.

22:45.495 --> 22:47.530
Yeah.

22:47.564 --> 22:50.667
Hey, look, uh,

22:50.701 --> 22:53.903
there's a memorial for Walden
at the CIA later today.

22:53.938 --> 22:55.538
Brody, I can't go with you.

22:55.573 --> 22:57.373
I know.

22:57.408 --> 22:59.042
- I mean...
- No. It's fine.

22:59.076 --> 23:01.478
That's fine. I just need
to come by, get my suit.

23:01.512 --> 23:03.547
Oh. Okay.

23:03.581 --> 23:05.849
Well, uh,
Chris has a game at 12:00.

23:05.883 --> 23:07.684
We'll be gone
till 2:00.

23:07.718 --> 23:10.887
All right, I'll come by then.

23:10.921 --> 23:12.422
How is Chris?

23:12.456 --> 23:14.424
He's not eating very much.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.361
It's weird.

23:17.395 --> 23:18.695
And Dana?

23:18.730 --> 23:21.097
We're fine, Brody.
We're just, um...

23:21.132 --> 23:23.433
trying to get on.

23:23.467 --> 23:26.102
Yeah. Right.

23:26.136 --> 23:28.271
Okay. Bye.

23:28.305 --> 23:30.539
Bye.

23:35.111 --> 23:37.145
I can do the outside.

23:37.180 --> 23:40.015
Uh-huh.

23:40.050 --> 23:41.717
You're not the only one ahead.

23:41.751 --> 23:43.986
Right.

23:44.021 --> 23:46.989
♪ Yes, it's true... ♪

23:47.023 --> 23:49.692
Hey.

23:49.726 --> 23:52.194
Can I buy you a beer?

23:52.229 --> 23:54.230
Why not?

23:57.901 --> 24:00.903
♪ Never had so much trouble... ♪

24:00.937 --> 24:03.506
Two Rolling Rocks--
this guy's favorite.

24:03.541 --> 24:05.809
'Cause I'm cheap.

24:05.843 --> 24:07.377
Always were.

24:07.412 --> 24:09.613
So,

24:09.647 --> 24:12.316
is this a peace negotiation?

24:12.350 --> 24:14.885
I'm not at war with you.

24:14.919 --> 24:16.853
Good.

24:25.696 --> 24:27.663
Mike...

24:27.698 --> 24:29.932
we're splitting up--

24:29.967 --> 24:32.835
me and Jess.

24:32.870 --> 24:36.906
Jesus. It's tough?

24:36.940 --> 24:39.208
Yeah. It's best
for everyone.

24:43.747 --> 24:46.849
You took care of 'em
for eight years when I was gone.

24:46.883 --> 24:49.818
You took care of 'em
last week when I couldn't.

24:49.852 --> 24:51.953
It's no trouble.

24:58.860 --> 25:02.229
You can keep
taking care of them.

25:03.532 --> 25:04.832
If you want.

25:08.604 --> 25:11.038
Because I can't right now.

25:15.443 --> 25:17.844
This isn't the way
it was supposed to go.

25:19.280 --> 25:20.647
No.

25:31.625 --> 25:32.858
Thanks.

25:39.266 --> 25:41.234
Fuck.

25:54.780 --> 25:58.049
Well, if it isn't Javert.

25:58.084 --> 26:00.485
You can go.

26:01.287 --> 26:02.721
I can go?

26:02.755 --> 26:04.089
That's what I said.

26:05.458 --> 26:08.893
Oh, goddamn it.

26:08.928 --> 26:10.929
Is he dead?
Did you kill Brody?

26:10.963 --> 26:12.597
No.

26:12.631 --> 26:15.633
I decided you were right.

26:15.667 --> 26:18.236
He held up his end,
so we'll hold up ours.

26:18.270 --> 26:19.638
So I called it off.

26:19.672 --> 26:22.207
What took you so fucking long?

26:22.242 --> 26:25.745
- I needed to cool off. - I needed to
sit here for three days while you did?

26:25.779 --> 26:27.613
- Watch your step.
- Why?

26:27.648 --> 26:30.049
Gonna bring out your big,
bad report on me?

26:30.084 --> 26:31.785
Your five-alarm warning,

26:31.819 --> 26:34.254
what a dangerous fucking
figure Saul Berenson is?

26:37.291 --> 26:39.326
The report is being
redacted as we speak.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.728
Why?

26:41.762 --> 26:43.764
Why, David?

26:45.333 --> 26:48.335
Maybe I'm just giving
an old guy a break.

27:58.775 --> 28:00.676
No soccer for you?

28:00.710 --> 28:04.245
I wanted to stay here.

28:04.280 --> 28:06.714
How're you doing?

28:07.949 --> 28:10.384
Bad.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.587
I know.

28:13.621 --> 28:15.990
I'm sorry.

28:16.024 --> 28:18.426
Where are you going?

28:18.460 --> 28:21.262
To a ceremony for
Finn Walden's dad.

28:21.296 --> 28:23.765
Will Finn be there?

28:24.967 --> 28:26.835
Probably.

28:34.244 --> 28:36.779
You remember that day that
you were dressing in here,

28:36.813 --> 28:39.215
and you wanted me to leave?

28:40.651 --> 28:42.084
I'm not sure...

28:42.119 --> 28:44.087
It was the day that
that lady came.

28:44.121 --> 28:45.388
Carrie.

28:47.825 --> 28:49.825
Okay.

28:51.461 --> 28:53.830
You never care if I'm in here
while you're getting ready.

28:56.266 --> 28:58.768
And then...

28:58.802 --> 29:03.906
what she said about a bomb...

29:03.940 --> 29:06.308
...and you wanting
to hurt people.

29:06.343 --> 29:08.211
That the war had
messed you up...

29:08.245 --> 29:09.813
Dana. Look...

29:09.847 --> 29:13.217
It adds up, is the thing.

29:13.251 --> 29:15.652
It is the only thing
that makes sense.

29:17.855 --> 29:19.322
I don't want to lie to you.

29:20.624 --> 29:22.424
Then don't.

29:27.764 --> 29:29.732
She isn't crazy, is she?

29:29.766 --> 29:31.166
Carrie? No.

29:31.201 --> 29:32.968
She's not.

29:33.002 --> 29:35.837
So you were going to
do those things.

29:35.872 --> 29:37.139
But I didn't.

29:37.173 --> 29:39.608
And I wouldn't now.

29:43.313 --> 29:44.847
Oh, my God.

29:44.881 --> 29:47.951
Hey...

29:47.985 --> 29:50.353
Look, I was screwed up.

29:52.890 --> 29:54.691
That's why I hurt your mom.

29:54.726 --> 29:57.127
And you guys.

30:00.899 --> 30:04.535
It is like you just
don't know anyone.

30:04.569 --> 30:06.971
Hey.

30:07.739 --> 30:09.440
You know me.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.814
Dana...

30:28.027 --> 30:29.527
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:34.933 --> 30:37.134
Well, you look nice.

30:37.169 --> 30:40.037
I'm overseeing
Nazir's ceremony.

30:40.071 --> 30:42.339
Mm. Burial at sea?

30:42.373 --> 30:44.641
Seems to be the method
of choice these days.

30:44.675 --> 30:46.909
Want to come along?

30:46.944 --> 30:50.346
Oh, I promised Brody I'd see
him at the memorial service.

30:52.849 --> 30:54.717
- Then walk me out, at least.
- Yeah.

31:00.557 --> 31:03.059
This'll put you in line to be
the youngest station chief

31:03.093 --> 31:04.494
in the history of the Agency.

31:04.528 --> 31:06.696
How on earth did you
swing this with Estes?

31:06.730 --> 31:07.930
I haven't.

31:07.965 --> 31:09.432
Not yet, anyway.

31:09.466 --> 31:12.101
Well, what makes you
think he'll play ball?

31:12.136 --> 31:14.537
Because you deserve it.

31:14.571 --> 31:16.573
Plus he owes me.

31:16.607 --> 31:18.408
He does?

31:18.442 --> 31:20.443
Does that have anything
to do with where you've been

31:20.477 --> 31:21.944
the last three days?

31:21.978 --> 31:23.946
That's a long story.

31:23.980 --> 31:26.382
Wow.

31:28.719 --> 31:31.454
I mean...

31:31.488 --> 31:33.523
Station chief?

31:33.557 --> 31:35.192
Why do you not look thrilled?

31:35.226 --> 31:37.627
I...

31:40.164 --> 31:41.598
I just have to think about it.

31:41.632 --> 31:44.000
What's to think about?

31:46.437 --> 31:48.104
Look, you know
the struggles that I have.

31:48.139 --> 31:50.273
Which you're
managing very well.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.945
Well, sometimes I think about
a more balanced life, is all.

31:54.979 --> 31:57.314
This is your life.

31:57.348 --> 32:01.286
Well, I've always
believed that, but...

32:01.320 --> 32:03.755
What's changed?

32:09.430 --> 32:10.663
Brody.

32:16.303 --> 32:18.404
I thought you said
your eyes were open.

32:19.673 --> 32:22.174
My eyes are open.

32:22.209 --> 32:24.076
Brody has kept every
promise he's made to us.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.510
Without him, we never
would have rolled up

32:25.545 --> 32:27.479
Nazir or his network.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.280
He's a man who put on
a suicide vest, Carrie.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.182
That's who he is.
That's who he always will be.

32:31.216 --> 32:34.919
I know everything he is.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.688
But it's...

32:37.723 --> 32:39.023
it's complicated.

32:39.057 --> 32:41.459
No, it's crystal clear.

32:41.493 --> 32:42.860
You cannot be with him.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.364
Who are you to say that to me?

32:46.399 --> 32:47.833
You can do whatever you want.

32:47.867 --> 32:49.869
An intelligence officer can't.

32:49.903 --> 32:51.771
Don't you think I know that?

32:51.805 --> 32:54.140
So you're choosing him over us?

32:56.310 --> 32:58.945
- I don't know!
- You're throwing your life away.

32:58.979 --> 33:00.980
Or maybe I'm-I'm just not

33:01.015 --> 33:02.382
giving it away, to this place.

33:02.416 --> 33:04.050
Maybe...

33:04.084 --> 33:08.121
- maybe I want other things.
- Like a terrorist in your bed.

33:08.155 --> 33:10.118
And maybe I don't want to be
alone my whole fucking life!

33:10.152 --> 33:12.893
- Like me. - Like you. 'Cause it
doesn't look that great, Saul.

33:12.927 --> 33:15.462
How does it feel?

33:15.497 --> 33:18.833
You don't know
a goddamned thing.

33:18.867 --> 33:22.003
You're the smartest and
the dumbest fucking person

33:22.038 --> 33:24.706
I've ever known.

33:52.635 --> 33:54.636
Sir.

33:59.809 --> 34:02.177
Excuse me.

34:02.211 --> 34:03.411
Nick.

34:03.446 --> 34:04.913
Cynthia.

34:04.947 --> 34:07.081
Sorry.

34:07.116 --> 34:09.618
I'm behind a lot of Xanax here.

34:09.652 --> 34:11.052
That's okay.

34:11.087 --> 34:13.455
You want me to
see you to your seat?

34:14.389 --> 34:16.091
Please.

34:48.492 --> 34:50.927
All right.

34:50.960 --> 34:53.596
Hello, Finn.

34:53.630 --> 34:56.063
Hi, Mr. Brody.

34:56.099 --> 34:57.566
Tell Dana I said hi.

34:58.835 --> 35:00.269
I will.

35:00.303 --> 35:03.505
Anything else I can do for you?

35:03.539 --> 35:05.240
No. I'm fine, thank you.

35:05.274 --> 35:06.741
Okay.

35:12.515 --> 35:14.015
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

36:42.470 --> 36:44.404
...a man of conviction.

36:44.439 --> 36:47.674
A man of principle.

36:47.709 --> 36:49.944
It was Bill Walden who coined
the phrase "Fortress America,"

36:49.978 --> 36:53.113
who led this Agency
out of its darkest hour,

36:53.148 --> 36:55.949
and in the process,

36:55.984 --> 36:58.785
transformed the very way we
defend ourselves here at home.

37:00.755 --> 37:02.289
It was Bill Walden who

37:02.323 --> 37:05.558
championed a fledgling
drone program,

37:05.592 --> 37:07.059
which has since
degraded Al-Qaeda

37:07.094 --> 37:08.861
to the point of irrelevance.

37:08.895 --> 37:10.762
And it was Bill Walden who

37:10.797 --> 37:12.764
laid the groundwork
for the operations

37:12.799 --> 37:14.232
that took out Osama Bin Laden

37:14.267 --> 37:15.700
and Abu Nazir.

37:37.190 --> 37:38.957
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

37:40.860 --> 37:43.361
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

37:45.765 --> 37:47.599
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

37:49.368 --> 37:51.436
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

38:22.002 --> 38:23.903
I've decided,

38:23.937 --> 38:25.338
and I want to be with you.

38:25.372 --> 38:28.307
What, now? Or...?

38:28.342 --> 38:30.276
Both.

38:43.925 --> 38:46.827
Amen.

38:49.832 --> 38:51.732
We honor your husband

38:51.767 --> 38:53.367
for all he has done
for this agency

38:53.402 --> 38:56.170
and for this great country.

38:57.406 --> 38:59.007
What made you change your mind?

39:01.110 --> 39:03.078
You did.

39:07.384 --> 39:10.252
What's wrong?

39:10.287 --> 39:11.520
Nothing.

39:11.555 --> 39:14.590
Why the sad look then?

39:14.624 --> 39:15.858
I'm not sad.

39:15.893 --> 39:18.261
The opposite.

39:31.442 --> 39:32.942
That's weird.

39:32.977 --> 39:34.444
What?

39:34.478 --> 39:37.013
Somebody moved my car.

39:37.047 --> 39:38.114
What are you talking about?

39:38.148 --> 39:39.849
I didn't park it there.

39:39.883 --> 39:40.950
I parked in Lot C.

39:44.888 --> 39:46.556
Oh, fuck.

39:46.590 --> 39:48.624
...the president joins me
in expressing

39:48.659 --> 39:49.892
his deepest sadness...

41:20.923 --> 41:22.090
Carrie?

41:25.161 --> 41:26.194
Don't

41:26.228 --> 41:27.228
you

41:27.262 --> 41:28.396
move.

41:28.430 --> 41:31.198
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

41:31.233 --> 41:32.065
Carrie.

41:32.100 --> 41:34.001
I said, shut up!

41:37.839 --> 41:41.375
Oh... Oh...

41:41.409 --> 41:42.910
Oh, my God.

41:44.580 --> 41:45.914
This isn't me, Carrie.
I didn't do this.

41:45.948 --> 41:48.583
Bullshit!

41:48.618 --> 41:50.318
I swear to you...

41:50.353 --> 41:52.087
Don't!

41:52.121 --> 41:53.255
For Christ's sake, Carrie.

41:53.289 --> 41:55.190
Listen to me. Look at me.

41:55.224 --> 41:56.725
Why would I do this?

41:56.759 --> 41:58.760
I can't see into your
fucking soul, Brody!

41:58.795 --> 42:00.562
Yes, you can.

42:00.596 --> 42:02.764
It was in your car.

42:02.798 --> 42:04.065
I didn't know!

42:07.436 --> 42:08.736
I don't believe you.

42:12.374 --> 42:13.374
Carrie?

42:15.077 --> 42:16.611
I'm gonna stand up now,

42:16.645 --> 42:20.081
really slowly.

42:20.115 --> 42:23.051
So if you want to shoot me,

42:23.085 --> 42:24.986
go ahead.

42:32.095 --> 42:34.063
It was Nazir who did this.

42:34.097 --> 42:35.431
It had to be.

42:35.465 --> 42:37.466
Nazir is dead.

42:37.501 --> 42:38.768
Yeah, he is.

42:38.802 --> 42:40.069
So what the fuck are
you talking about?

42:40.104 --> 42:42.138
He played us all
from the beginning.

42:42.172 --> 42:43.472
How, by letting himself
get killed?

42:43.506 --> 42:44.640
Why not?

42:44.674 --> 42:46.609
Because it's insane!

42:46.643 --> 42:48.077
Think about it.

42:48.112 --> 42:50.279
Think about it, Carrie.

42:50.313 --> 42:53.950
What better way to make us
to drop our guard?

42:53.984 --> 42:56.652
Dam Neck was never the target.

42:56.687 --> 43:01.124
Roya and her crew
were sacrificed.

43:01.158 --> 43:03.293
No.

43:03.327 --> 43:05.728
It was always Walden with him.

43:05.762 --> 43:07.730
It was always the CIA.

43:07.764 --> 43:10.633
Nazir would've died
a thousand deaths

43:10.667 --> 43:12.735
to make this day happen.

43:28.518 --> 43:30.119
Carrie?

43:30.153 --> 43:32.455
Oh, shit.

43:32.489 --> 43:34.691
Are you okay?

43:34.725 --> 43:35.959
You okay, Carrie?

43:35.993 --> 43:37.593
You...

43:37.628 --> 43:39.495
You okay?

43:41.999 --> 43:44.467
Hey. Hey.

43:47.171 --> 43:49.505
This isn't fucking happening.

43:49.540 --> 43:52.341
Hey.

43:59.549 --> 44:00.783
It wasn't me.

44:00.818 --> 44:03.486
It wasn't me.

44:09.392 --> 44:10.559
We have to go.

44:10.593 --> 44:11.960
What do you mean? Go where?

44:11.994 --> 44:13.161
No one else will believe you.

44:13.195 --> 44:15.697
We have to go.
We have to go right now.

44:36.719 --> 44:38.419
...details emerging now

44:38.454 --> 44:40.855
about the massive explosion
that ripped through Langley

44:40.889 --> 44:43.191
25 minutes ago.

44:43.225 --> 44:45.059
Although we have
no confirmation,

44:45.093 --> 44:47.195
several sources are reporting
that this was an act of terror

44:47.229 --> 44:49.431
targeting the memorial service
for Vice President Walden.

44:49.465 --> 44:50.899
Oh, my God,
I can't get through.

44:50.933 --> 44:52.901
The lines are down
at Langley, too.

44:52.935 --> 44:55.003
Mom.

44:55.037 --> 44:58.407
...including Secretary
of Defense Richard Halstead,

44:58.441 --> 44:59.608
Secretary of
Homeland Security...

45:01.277 --> 45:03.579
You guys stay here.

45:03.613 --> 45:05.280
It's about Brody?

45:05.315 --> 45:06.615
Ma'am, I'm Agent Hall.

45:06.649 --> 45:09.017
We have a situation.
Can we come inside?

45:09.052 --> 45:10.452
Is he alive?

45:10.487 --> 45:12.021
Major, please step aside.

45:12.055 --> 45:13.789
Not until you tell us
what the hell is going on.

45:13.824 --> 45:14.957
We need to search the premises.

45:14.991 --> 45:16.225
Where's your warrant?

45:16.259 --> 45:17.760
Major, don't make a scene.

45:17.794 --> 45:18.794
Don't force me to make one.

45:18.828 --> 45:20.896
Just step aside.

45:27.904 --> 45:29.405
I don't understand.
What's happening?

45:29.439 --> 45:32.808
Please. Just let us
do our job.

45:32.843 --> 45:34.443
...from the president saying,

45:34.478 --> 45:37.412
"The explosion today
at Langley is a tragedy."

45:37.447 --> 45:38.647
- Hang on.
- "The victims and their families

45:38.681 --> 45:40.715
are in our deepest prayers."

45:54.595 --> 45:56.462
What are we doing here?

45:56.497 --> 45:58.698
Activating my insurance policy.

46:02.336 --> 46:03.604
Fuck.

46:03.638 --> 46:06.106
Here, let me help.

46:06.140 --> 46:07.574
A friend, June, will meet
us at the border.

46:07.609 --> 46:09.142
She'll drive us up to Montreal,

46:09.177 --> 46:11.111
where we get onto
a fishing boat

46:11.145 --> 46:13.914
which takes us up
to Newfoundland.

46:16.017 --> 46:17.518
From there, we
board a freighter

46:17.552 --> 46:18.852
which will take us into
international waters.

46:18.887 --> 46:20.654
It's the, uh, gold key.

46:20.688 --> 46:22.289
- This one here?
- Yeah.

46:29.898 --> 46:31.298
Shit.

46:39.573 --> 46:40.940
Jesus.

46:40.975 --> 46:42.776
My mom taught me to
save for a rainy day.

46:42.810 --> 46:44.511
"Ellen Kramer."

46:44.545 --> 46:47.680
I'm guessing that's not an
agency-approved cover.

46:47.715 --> 46:48.882
You'll have to be
someone else, too.

46:48.916 --> 46:50.450
We'll stop on the way.

46:50.484 --> 46:51.818
The guy who makes these
is expensive,

46:51.852 --> 46:53.920
but nobody owns him.

47:18.179 --> 47:19.579
Mr. Berenson,
Sloane Nelson.

47:19.613 --> 47:21.014
I'm with Defense.

47:21.048 --> 47:22.915
The acting secretary
sent me to facilitate

47:22.950 --> 47:24.750
between the Bureau
and the Agency.

47:24.785 --> 47:26.552
How many dead?

47:26.586 --> 47:29.555
We'll be pulling out bodies
for the next couple days.

47:30.556 --> 47:31.589
How many so far?

47:31.624 --> 47:33.925
Almost 200.

47:33.959 --> 47:35.426
Survivors?

47:35.461 --> 47:36.928
Twenty-seven.

47:36.962 --> 47:39.931
Most have already been
taken to Sibley Memorial.

47:39.965 --> 47:41.733
Who's tracking the names?

47:41.767 --> 47:43.535
There's a list
in the triage tent.

47:43.569 --> 47:45.470
Show me.

47:53.412 --> 47:54.613
This way, sir.

48:02.455 --> 48:04.957
Cynthia Walden is
confirmed dead.

48:04.991 --> 48:06.726
Their son, Finn,
was killed as well.

48:06.760 --> 48:08.127
Okay.

48:08.161 --> 48:11.397
David Estes, also deceased.

48:17.905 --> 48:20.139
I don't see Carrie Mathison
on either list.

48:20.174 --> 48:21.441
She's unaccounted for.

48:21.475 --> 48:22.608
But she was present.

48:22.643 --> 48:24.110
Yes, sir.

48:24.144 --> 48:26.246
You see anyone walking
away from this scene?

48:26.280 --> 48:27.714
No, sir.

48:27.748 --> 48:29.750
So she's presumed dead?

48:29.784 --> 48:32.086
Don't fucking sugarcoat it.

48:32.120 --> 48:34.988
I understand you were
close to her.

48:41.596 --> 48:44.298
Congressman Brody was at
the ceremony as well.

48:44.332 --> 48:46.500
He's also presumed dead,

48:46.534 --> 48:49.803
but there's something else.

48:49.838 --> 48:51.572
What's that?

48:51.606 --> 48:54.707
Preliminary forensics suggest
the bomb was in his car.

48:56.277 --> 48:58.011
Brody's car?

48:58.045 --> 48:59.646
The forensics team is
waiting to give you

48:59.680 --> 49:02.015
a full debrief so you can
brief the president.

49:02.049 --> 49:03.416
Me?

49:03.451 --> 49:05.185
You're the ranking officer
on site, sir.

49:05.219 --> 49:06.720
You're in charge.

49:10.191 --> 49:11.658
Give me a minute, please?

49:11.693 --> 49:13.827
Of course.
We'll be in C Wing.

49:36.786 --> 49:39.388
Hi, it's Carrie Mathison.
Leave a message.

49:40.757 --> 49:42.458
Carrie,

49:42.492 --> 49:44.360
it's me.

49:44.395 --> 49:47.197
I'm looking for you.

49:49.166 --> 49:51.735
Please call me back.

50:13.625 --> 50:15.459
...the damage
this attack has done

50:15.493 --> 50:17.695
to the highest echelons
of American intelligence...

50:17.729 --> 50:20.498
I can't listen to this anymore.

50:20.532 --> 50:22.500
How are you doing? Okay?

50:23.669 --> 50:25.236
Yeah.

50:25.270 --> 50:27.104
Do you want me
to drive for a while?

50:27.139 --> 50:28.573
No, we're almost there.

50:52.264 --> 50:53.464
Ellen.

50:53.498 --> 50:55.499
Mike.

51:06.510 --> 51:08.478
Stand here.

51:09.513 --> 51:11.514
And, uh, don't smile.

51:22.561 --> 51:24.328
So, we're doing

51:24.363 --> 51:26.164
the whole disappearing act,
right? Passport,

51:26.198 --> 51:27.799
- driver's license, birth certificate?
- How long will it take?

51:27.833 --> 51:29.801
How long do I have?

51:31.604 --> 51:33.939
So the Congressman doesn't
actually live here anymore?

51:33.973 --> 51:36.008
No.

51:36.042 --> 51:37.843
How much longer
are you gonna be?

51:37.878 --> 51:39.145
When did he move out?

51:39.179 --> 51:40.713
Thursday.
But he was here

51:40.747 --> 51:43.349
- earlier today?
- I told you all of this already.

51:43.383 --> 51:45.351
He needed a suit
for the memorial.

51:46.586 --> 51:48.588
He didn't do it.

51:48.622 --> 51:49.989
Excuse me?

51:50.024 --> 51:52.192
I mean, that's what
you're all saying,

51:52.226 --> 51:54.027
- isn't it?
- Nobody's saying that, Dana.

51:54.062 --> 51:56.363
- Don't take sides, Mom.
- I'm not taking sides.

51:56.397 --> 51:58.999
No, it is obvious what they
think and they're wrong.

51:59.033 --> 52:00.734
What makes you so sure?

52:00.768 --> 52:04.771
Because I was here,
and I talked to him.

52:04.806 --> 52:06.139
And?

52:07.208 --> 52:09.443
And... he was fine.

52:09.477 --> 52:11.378
He was totally fine.

52:11.413 --> 52:13.147
What did you two talk about?

52:14.216 --> 52:16.284
Nothing. Just...

52:16.318 --> 52:18.085
normal stuff.

52:18.120 --> 52:20.855
How'd the conversation end?

52:20.889 --> 52:25.126
It was not like he
said good-bye for good,

52:25.160 --> 52:27.395
if that's what you mean.

52:27.429 --> 52:29.430
How do you know?

52:31.867 --> 52:33.901
Because I know.

52:34.970 --> 52:37.004
Look.

52:38.106 --> 52:39.173
It's Dad on TV.

52:39.207 --> 52:40.374
People will say

52:40.408 --> 52:42.442
I was broken,

52:42.477 --> 52:44.444
I was brainwashed.

52:44.478 --> 52:48.247
People will say that I was
turned into a terrorist,

52:48.282 --> 52:52.352
taught to hate my country.

52:52.386 --> 52:54.387
I love...

52:54.421 --> 52:57.556
my country.

52:58.591 --> 53:00.526
What I am...

53:00.560 --> 53:04.229
is a marine,
like my father before me

53:04.264 --> 53:06.332
and his father before him.

53:06.366 --> 53:08.300
And as a marine,

53:08.335 --> 53:12.437
I swore an oath to defend
the United States of America

53:12.472 --> 53:16.007
against enemies
both foreign and domestic.

53:16.042 --> 53:18.643
My action this day

53:18.677 --> 53:21.512
is against
such domestic enemies.

53:21.547 --> 53:23.147
Turn it off, Chris.

53:23.182 --> 53:24.348
No.

53:24.383 --> 53:26.517
We need to see this.
All of us.

53:26.552 --> 53:30.788
...security team, who I know
to be liars and war criminals.

53:30.822 --> 53:35.526
Responsible for atrocities they
were never held accountable for.

53:35.561 --> 53:38.696
This is about justice

53:38.731 --> 53:41.332
for 82 children

53:41.366 --> 53:45.002
whose deaths were never
acknowledged,

53:45.037 --> 53:47.371
and whose murder is a stain
on the soul

53:47.406 --> 53:48.406
of this nation.

53:48.440 --> 53:50.074
Fuck me.

53:50.108 --> 53:51.242
In addition

53:51.276 --> 53:52.777
to Congressman Brody's
taped message,

53:52.811 --> 53:56.113
the militant group released
the following statement,

53:56.148 --> 53:58.849
claiming responsibility
for the attack.

54:04.088 --> 54:06.490
The demise
of Al-Qaeda is a myth.

54:06.524 --> 54:09.058
For every action,
there is a reaction.

54:09.093 --> 54:12.628
Just as you lay waste
to our nation, we lay waste

54:12.663 --> 54:14.663
to yours, God willing.

54:14.698 --> 54:17.734
And nothing is too great
for God.

54:33.418 --> 54:35.386
Give me your phone.

54:47.433 --> 54:49.934
The minute you reach out
to your family--

54:49.969 --> 54:52.971
the second-- they'll be
on us like bloodhounds.

55:08.622 --> 55:10.623
Hello?

55:10.657 --> 55:12.691
Saul.

55:12.726 --> 55:15.194
- Thank God.
- Mira.

55:15.228 --> 55:18.897
You know, I-I've been
trying you for hours. I...

55:18.932 --> 55:21.667
Are you... are you okay?

55:21.701 --> 55:23.202
I'm okay.

55:23.236 --> 55:25.237
We've been watching.

55:25.271 --> 55:27.039
I-It's so terrible.

55:27.073 --> 55:28.741
Awful.

55:28.775 --> 55:32.011
So y-you weren't there?

55:32.045 --> 55:34.380
No.

55:34.414 --> 55:37.115
And, um, is Carrie...

55:37.150 --> 55:40.152
is... is she all right?

55:41.621 --> 55:43.623
Gone.

55:45.058 --> 55:47.893
Oh, Saul. I...

55:47.927 --> 55:50.896
I know.

55:53.933 --> 55:57.268
I'm gonna come back.

55:58.337 --> 56:00.338
Yes.

56:01.874 --> 56:04.109
Please.

56:04.143 --> 56:06.678
...this was a terrorist attack.
They only released...

57:08.075 --> 57:10.076
The border's in a few miles.

57:11.111 --> 57:12.678
Yeah. We driving over?

57:12.712 --> 57:14.881
There's a fire road
about a mile before.

57:14.915 --> 57:18.118
It's better to cross on foot in
the forest where there's cover.

57:18.152 --> 57:19.219
Then what?

57:19.253 --> 57:20.553
A hike to Lake Selby.

57:20.588 --> 57:22.021
It's about 20 miles.

57:22.056 --> 57:24.023
June has a summer cabin there.

57:25.059 --> 57:27.026
Okay.

57:28.396 --> 57:29.830
Here's the road.

58:18.281 --> 58:19.948
Back in the woods.

58:22.418 --> 58:25.053
It seems to be our place.

58:29.559 --> 58:31.560
So...

58:33.564 --> 58:35.565
So...

58:37.401 --> 58:40.769
You're not coming, are you?

58:40.804 --> 58:43.706
I'm...

58:45.409 --> 58:47.243
I want to.

58:48.312 --> 58:51.480
I was going to, but I...

58:52.516 --> 58:55.417
I can't now.

59:09.832 --> 59:11.667
We came so close.

59:12.702 --> 59:15.171
It can still happen.

59:15.205 --> 59:17.040
- One day.
- Yeah?

59:17.074 --> 59:18.675
I'm gonna clear your name,

59:18.709 --> 59:20.309
- Brody.
- Carrie.

59:20.344 --> 59:22.011
You got me here.

59:22.045 --> 59:24.780
That's more than you
ever had to do.

59:24.815 --> 59:27.516
Hey, you're talking
in the past tense.

59:27.550 --> 59:30.519
- Whatever happens or doesn't...
- It will!

59:31.554 --> 59:33.522
This was love.

59:35.025 --> 59:37.426
You and me.

59:42.699 --> 59:44.800
But it's not good-bye.

59:44.834 --> 59:47.603
Okay.

59:47.638 --> 59:50.607
What, you don't believe me?

59:50.641 --> 59:54.277
However it hurts the least.

01:00:00.617 --> 01:00:02.618
Oh, my God.

01:00:05.155 --> 01:00:08.157
Why do I feel like this?

01:00:09.393 --> 01:00:12.361
'Cause you gave it up to me.

01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:22.738
Completely.

01:00:41.992 --> 01:00:43.993
Good-bye, love.

01:01:33.311 --> 01:01:36.380
Check with TEDAC to make sure
the bomb residue

01:01:36.414 --> 01:01:38.515
from Congressman Brody's car...

01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:42.519
...matches the
C-4 taken out of the...

01:01:42.553 --> 01:01:45.822
tailor shop in Gettysburg.

01:01:45.856 --> 01:01:48.858
That'll give us
a place to start.

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.707
Saul.

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:48.584
Saul.
