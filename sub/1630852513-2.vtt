Narrator:<i> And sent police down</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:31.780
They had abducted three women

<i> A vast stretch of rolling dunes</i>

01:25.286 --> 01:29.288
Ord, nebraska

Michael:
<i> It is kind of a small town</i>

01:32.293 --> 01:33.709

01:33.761 --> 01:37.796
It's a farming

01:37.831 --> 01:39.765
<i> Very friendly.</i>

01:54.348 --> 01:55.614
<i> There's not a lot of crime.</i>

01:55.649 --> 01:56.782
You can let you children

Party hill was--

02:26.280 --> 02:32.217
Kind of a known drinking spot

she thought it was a ball

become deflated.

02:45.899 --> 02:49.468
But when she looked
at it closer,

02:49.503 --> 02:51.920
it looked like bone.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.675
<i> She made an x</i>

02:56.710 --> 02:59.711

03:14.445 --> 03:19.948
It was by hand
and very, very meticulous.

03:19.984 --> 03:23.819
It was comparable
to an archeological dig.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.271
Larry:<i> I started to walk</i>

04:54.878 --> 04:56.828
Michael:
<i> Sharlene was the bar manager</i>

04:56.864 --> 05:01.383
<i> and cathy beard worked</i>

05:01.418 --> 05:03.552

05:03.587 --> 05:06.755
Casey: Sharlene and cathy
were very good friends.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.641
I think you would call them

Robert:<i> I've known cathy</i>

05:12.930 --> 05:15.597
I remember when my mom sharlene
bartending,

05:15.649 --> 05:20.519
it seemed like cathy was always
sitting at the end of the bar.

05:20.554 --> 05:24.523
<i> Cathy has always had</i>
<i> a smile on her face.</i>

05:24.558 --> 05:29.328
Cathy was kind of social
and really enjoyed her friends.

Narrator:
<i> On a warm spring evening,</i>

05:34.501 --> 05:38.069

Michael:<i> This happened</i>
<i> to be cathy's night off,</i>

05:40.874 --> 05:43.458
but she, you know,
went down to the bar

05:43.510 --> 05:46.845
to see her friends.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.682
She had talked to several
people in the bar

05:50.718 --> 05:52.851
including sharlene whitefoot.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.771
Michael:
<i> This was a safe place to her.</i>

05:55.806 --> 05:59.858
She was very familiar
with the people there.

06:03.480 --> 06:09.117
<i> realizes that cathy is</i>
<i> suddenly nowhere to be found.</i>

06:10.204 --> 06:14.990
Sharlene noted that cathy
had left her cigarettes

06:15.042 --> 06:17.876
and her keys and some
other items on the bar

06:17.911 --> 06:20.879
which she felt was very unusual.

06:21.999 --> 06:24.916
Michael:<i> Cathy lived</i>
<i> with her mother veneta.</i>

06:24.951 --> 06:26.618
They were very close.

<i> that evening</i>

06:31.958 --> 06:34.159
<i> to head for the bar.</i>

06:34.194 --> 06:36.812
Sharlene became worried
about cathy

06:36.847 --> 06:39.981
and called
in the missing persons

06:40.017 --> 06:42.984
<i> from the bar that night.</i>

06:43.020 --> 06:44.736
Police don't really get involved

06:44.772 --> 06:47.972
until a person has been missing
for more than 24 hours.

06:47.991 --> 06:53.779
But because of the unusual
nature of cathy's disappearance,

06:53.814 --> 06:58.483
police started looking
into the case right away.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.503
When somebody leaves
their stuff unattended,

07:01.538 --> 07:06.124
that is a kind of a sign
of maybe something went wrong.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.845
Narrator:
<i> When police interview people</i>

07:09.880 --> 07:11.713

<i> John oldson and cathy beard</i>

07:21.525 --> 07:23.692
<i> did know each other.</i>

07:23.727 --> 07:26.445
I think cathy considered him
somewhat of a friend.

07:28.232 --> 07:29.981
Larry:<i> They were all sitting</i>
<i> at a table and john,</i>

07:30.016 --> 07:32.284
uh, got off from the table
and walked over

07:32.319 --> 07:37.656
and started talking to cathy
who was standing at the jukebox.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.541
They had some type
of a discussion

07:39.576 --> 07:43.995
<i> and at some point went out</i>
<i> the back door into the alley.</i>

07:44.030 --> 07:45.864
Narrator:<i> When the detectives</i>
<i> visit john oldson</i>

07:45.883 --> 07:48.934
<i> to ask him what happened</i>
<i> in the alley behind the bar,</i>

07:48.969 --> 07:54.706
<i> he readily admits that</i>
<i> he was trying to hit on cathy.</i>

07:54.725 --> 07:57.225
John wanted to be with cathy.

07:57.261 --> 08:02.931
Michael:<i> He attempted to have</i>
<i> a relationship with her</i>

08:02.983 --> 08:04.649
but she refused.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.752
Glenn:<i> She said, uh,</i>
<i> I see you as a friend but,</i>

08:07.788 --> 08:13.074
you know, not--
not the way you're talking.

08:13.110 --> 08:14.726
Narrator:
<i> John tells the investigators</i>

08:14.745 --> 08:16.227
<i> that while he and cathy</i>
<i> were talking,</i>

08:16.246 --> 08:19.731
<i> a pickup truck</i>
<i> pulled into the alley.</i>

08:19.750 --> 08:21.950
Larry:
<i> The passenger door opened up</i>

08:22.002 --> 08:26.087
and cathy entered the vehicle
and the door closed.

08:26.123 --> 08:28.907
Narrator:<i> John claims</i>
<i> he didn't recognize the man,</i>

08:28.926 --> 08:32.627
<i> but he did catch part</i>
<i> of the truck's license plate</i>

08:32.679 --> 08:34.596
<i> as it drove off.</i>

08:34.631 --> 08:35.964
He thought it had
88 county plates

08:36.016 --> 08:40.268
and he couldn't get
the rest of the numbers.

08:40.304 --> 08:42.754
An 88 county license
which would be loup county

08:42.773 --> 08:47.259
<i> and it would be about</i>
<i> 31 miles from ord.</i>

08:49.313 --> 08:50.946
Narrator:<i> John tells the police</i>

08:50.981 --> 08:54.282
<i> cathy seemed to willingly</i>
<i> go off with the two men.</i>

08:54.318 --> 08:56.601
He said he felt
rebuffed and ashamed

08:56.620 --> 08:59.988
so he got in his pickup
and drove home

09:00.040 --> 09:02.173
and took a shower.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.326
His dad said john
was in the shower

09:04.378 --> 09:05.710
at the time he got home

38:19.464 --> 38:21.798
Glenn:
<i> They took her deposition.</i>

38:21.817 --> 38:25.518
<i> She was a frail old lady</i>

38:25.570 --> 38:27.354
and you're looking at her
saying,

38:27.406 --> 38:29.105
"yeah, I don't think so.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.107
Not even in her youth."

38:31.142 --> 38:34.244
jay:<i> The pages of the diary</i>
<i> were handwritten</i>

38:34.279 --> 38:39.482
and the handwriting
was not that of jean backus.

38:39.501 --> 38:43.586
Narrator:<i> Yet the details</i>
<i> of ranch life are specific.</i>

38:43.622 --> 38:47.624
Jay: The pages of the diary
described the neighbors,

38:47.659 --> 38:51.227
the terrain, and so on
in relationship

38:51.263 --> 38:54.297
<i> to where the backuses live.</i>

38:54.332 --> 38:57.734
<i> A pretty good,</i>
<i> accurate description.</i>

38:57.769 --> 38:59.352
Narrator:
<i> Whoever wrote the diary</i>

38:59.388 --> 39:02.722
<i> had day to day knowledge</i>
<i> of life on the ranch.</i>

39:02.774 --> 39:04.274
<i> Investigators asked jean</i>

39:04.309 --> 39:07.811
<i> who might have a grudge</i>
<i> against her.</i>

39:07.846 --> 39:11.197
Jay: Jean threw out
doug olson's name.

39:11.233 --> 39:14.851
Casey: Doug olson
worked for jean backus

39:14.870 --> 39:16.369
at the backus ranch.

39:16.405 --> 39:17.704
Narrator:
<i> Jean tells the investigators</i>

39:17.739 --> 39:19.656
<i> that doug believed</i>
<i> she cheated him</i>

39:19.691 --> 39:23.192
<i> out of part of the ranch</i>
<i> he thought he would inherit</i>

39:23.211 --> 39:25.378
<i> after wetzel backus' death.</i>

39:25.414 --> 39:30.750
That envelope is taken
to the state patrol crime lab

39:30.802 --> 39:32.585
<i> and they find doug olson's dna</i>

39:32.637 --> 39:36.923
on the flap of the envelope
and/or the stamp.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.758
Narrator:<i> Doug olson admits</i>
<i> trying to ruin</i>

39:38.810 --> 39:43.213
<i> the backus' reputation</i>
<i> by tying them to the murder.</i>

39:43.248 --> 39:45.682
<i> He's charged</i>
<i> with evidence tampering</i>

39:45.717 --> 39:49.903
<i> as the case against john</i>
<i> moves forward.</i>

39:49.938 --> 39:51.321
Casey:<i> We proved the diary</i>

39:51.356 --> 39:53.773
had nothing to do
with cathy beard.

39:53.825 --> 39:57.193
Bottom line is cathy
walked out the back door

39:57.228 --> 40:00.764
with john oldson
and never returned.

40:02.367 --> 40:04.284
Narrator:<i> In January 2013,</i>

40:04.336 --> 40:09.572
<i> the trial of john oldson</i>
<i> is finally set to begin.</i>

40:09.591 --> 40:13.576
Robert:<i> My mom wanted justice</i>
<i> for cathy.</i>

40:13.595 --> 40:18.932
She was glad it was finally
coming to an end.

40:21.303 --> 40:23.453
Narrator:<i> The investigation</i>
<i> could not determine</i>

40:23.488 --> 40:26.322
<i> whether cathy beard</i>
<i> was sexually assaulted</i>

40:26.358 --> 40:28.958
<i> because of the condition</i>
<i> of her remains.</i>

40:28.994 --> 40:31.427
<i> But the prosecutors</i>
<i> paint a picture for the jury</i>

40:31.446 --> 40:37.534
<i> of what they believe happened</i>
<i> on may 31st, 1989.</i>

40:39.371 --> 40:44.407
Larry: John olson said he was
getting a little bit aroused.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.827
Glenn:<i> When john oldson</i>
<i> and cathy beard</i>

40:47.879 --> 40:49.445
were in that bar,

40:49.464 --> 40:53.299
he was gonna have sex with her
that night regardless.

40:54.419 --> 40:55.718
Casey:<i> There was a struggle.</i>

40:55.754 --> 40:57.420
<i> He hit her in the head.</i>

40:57.455 --> 40:58.922
He threw her in the pickup.

40:58.957 --> 41:02.642
Michael: John oldson said,
"she said, "no, no, john.

41:02.677 --> 41:03.960
Please no, no."

41:03.979 --> 41:06.763
well, I believe
those were her last words.

41:06.798 --> 41:09.532
Casey:<i> After murdering her,</i>

41:09.568 --> 41:13.736
he then took her
to the dumpsite.

41:17.809 --> 41:21.027
<i> He did dispose</i>
<i> of cathy's body,</i>

41:21.079 --> 41:23.530
he felt safe that
she would never be found

41:23.582 --> 41:27.500
because party hill
was a remote area

41:27.536 --> 41:31.421
and law enforcement
was not typically driving

41:31.456 --> 41:33.706
by that location.

41:36.361 --> 41:37.994

41:38.013 --> 41:41.531
narrator:<i> After a week</i>
<i> and a half of testimony,</i>

41:41.566 --> 41:43.533
<i> the jury leaves to deliberate.</i>

41:43.568 --> 41:49.973
<i> It takes them just six hours</i>
<i> to decide john oldson's fate.</i>

41:51.643 --> 41:54.944
Glenn: The jury
found him guilty

41:54.980 --> 41:57.780
of second degree murder.

41:59.684 --> 42:04.020
Narrator:<i> He's sentenced</i>
<i> to life in prison.</i>

42:06.057 --> 42:09.358
Casey: You could just tell
in the community that it was a--

42:09.377 --> 42:12.962
a brick off
everybody's shoulders.

42:16.084 --> 42:21.638
Um, to get justice for cathy

42:21.673 --> 42:23.506
was what everybody wanted

42:23.541 --> 42:29.846
and that was our goal
and that's what we got.

42:32.851 --> 42:36.853
Michael:<i> This woman</i>
<i> should still be alive today.</i>

42:38.406 --> 42:40.573
<i> I'm confident that the family</i>

42:40.609 --> 42:45.762
and the community
felt justice was served.

42:45.797 --> 42:48.798
Robert:<i> Everybody's much</i>
<i> better with john in prison.</i>

42:48.833 --> 42:52.669
I think the world is better
with john in prison.

42:53.872 --> 42:56.839
<i> Cathy was always wanting</i>
<i> to help my mom.</i>

42:56.875 --> 42:59.943
They did about
everything together.

43:03.882 --> 43:05.915
My mom would want cathy
to be remembered

43:05.934 --> 43:08.851
as a good kind person.

43:08.887 --> 43:12.789
