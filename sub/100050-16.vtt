00:09.183 --> 00:10.749
ADULT SHELDON: In the early days

00:10.793 --> 00:13.448
of the Internet,
you couldn't stream movies

00:13.491 --> 00:16.233
or summon Thai food
to your doorstep.

00:16.277 --> 00:19.671
But... if you were interested
in text-based news

00:19.715 --> 00:21.673
about upcoming
physics lectures,

00:21.717 --> 00:23.675
it was a great time
to be alive.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.329
Holy moly.

00:29.725 --> 00:30.682
Dad.

00:31.683 --> 00:32.684
Dad!

00:32.728 --> 00:33.859
I'm in the shower!

00:33.903 --> 00:35.557
It's an emergency.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.689
Fine! Come in.

00:39.604 --> 00:40.779
Dad?

00:40.823 --> 00:42.564
I thought you
had to use the bathroom.

00:42.607 --> 00:44.609
At 7:23 in the morning?

00:44.653 --> 00:47.264
Why do I print out schedules if
you're not going to read them?

00:47.308 --> 00:48.787
Tell me what you want.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.050
What are we doing next weekend?

00:50.093 --> 00:52.139
This ain't sounding
like an emergency.

00:52.182 --> 00:54.663
It is. Stephen Hawking
is giving a lecture,

00:54.706 --> 00:56.795
and I really need to go.

00:56.839 --> 00:59.755
Can we talk about this
when I'm out of the shower?

00:59.798 --> 01:01.800
Pick up the pace.
According to the schedule

01:01.844 --> 01:05.326
that you don't read,
I'm due in there in six minutes.

01:06.762 --> 01:09.721
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:09.765 --> 01:12.768
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain

01:12.811 --> 01:15.249
♪ I bet I could be your hero

01:15.292 --> 01:17.686
♪ I am a mighty little man

01:17.729 --> 01:21.733
♪ I am a mighty little man.♪

01:24.823 --> 01:25.781
So can we go?

01:25.824 --> 01:27.696
I don't know.

01:27.739 --> 01:28.958
Go take a shower.

01:29.001 --> 01:30.786
I still have two minutes
and 15 seconds.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.092
Let's nail this down.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.617
Where's the lecture?

01:35.660 --> 01:37.271
And if the answer's Dallas,
we're not going.

01:37.314 --> 01:39.621
Good news:
it's not Dallas.
Where?

01:39.664 --> 01:41.231
Pasadena, California.

01:41.275 --> 01:42.537
California?

01:42.580 --> 01:44.234
That's a lot further
than Dallas.

01:44.278 --> 01:46.541
1,232 miles further
as the crow flies.

01:46.584 --> 01:49.370
But kudos to you
for being up on your geography.

01:50.414 --> 01:52.373
There's no way
we're going to California.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.375
If Stephen Hawking can
make it there in a wheelchair,

01:54.418 --> 01:55.767
I'm sure we can manage.

01:55.811 --> 01:57.943
: Sheldon,
airplane tickets are expensive.

01:57.987 --> 02:00.642
Hotels are expensive.
We can't afford it.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.470
But his health is fragile.

02:02.513 --> 02:05.647
This might be my only chance
to ever see him in person.

02:06.822 --> 02:09.172
I'm sorry, buddy.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.131
I would like
to discuss this further,

02:11.174 --> 02:12.915
but I only have...

02:12.958 --> 02:16.701
22 seconds to be in the shower,
and buttons slow me down.

02:20.662 --> 02:23.882
Thisis the moment
we lost that game.

02:23.926 --> 02:27.277
But one bad play doesn't
mean you give up.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.105
We had plenty of time
to turn it around,

02:29.149 --> 02:31.020
but y'all decided it was over.

02:31.063 --> 02:34.676
I don't want to ever
see that happen again.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.895
Next time something seems
out of your reach,

02:36.939 --> 02:38.897
you do not quit.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.812
You just dig deeper.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.858
Does that mean
if I find an affordable flight

02:42.901 --> 02:44.729
to California, we can go?

02:50.300 --> 02:52.607
Hi. Can I help you?

02:52.650 --> 02:54.783
I'm trying to find the cheapest
flight to California

02:54.826 --> 02:56.785
for me and my father.Okay.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.526
Well, have a seat.

02:58.569 --> 03:00.615
You lookin' to go
to Disneyland?

03:00.658 --> 03:02.269
The only ride
I'm interested in is

03:02.312 --> 03:05.533
the intellectual roller coaster
of Stephen Hawking's mind.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.579
And where is that located?

03:08.623 --> 03:10.494
Well... Stephen Hawking's head.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.888
But that will be at Caltech
in Pasadena.

03:12.931 --> 03:14.019
Got it.

03:14.063 --> 03:16.239
And, uh, when
were you looking to fly?

03:16.283 --> 03:17.284
Next weekend.

03:17.327 --> 03:18.807
Oh, wow, that's pretty soon.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.852
Traveling last-minute
can be pricey.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.854
Are there any discounts
available?

03:22.898 --> 03:24.900
Are you a member
of any frequent-flier programs?

03:24.943 --> 03:26.858
No. I've never flown before.

03:26.902 --> 03:29.383
Well, ways
to keep the cost down are:

03:29.426 --> 03:31.907
flying on weekdays,
multiple layovers, or--

03:31.950 --> 03:33.909
this probably
doesn't apply, but--

03:33.952 --> 03:35.040
airlines offer special fares

03:35.084 --> 03:37.086
if there's been a death
in the family.

03:37.129 --> 03:39.871
Interesting.
May I use your phone?

03:42.309 --> 03:43.440
Hello?

03:43.484 --> 03:44.876
What else you got?

03:44.920 --> 03:46.313
Hello?

03:46.356 --> 03:47.749
See ya.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.881
Where you going?Out with Jana.

03:49.925 --> 03:52.406
You've been spending a lot
of time with her lately.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.234
Is she your girlfriend?

03:54.277 --> 03:55.931
Dad, can you make her stop?

03:55.974 --> 03:58.325
Yeah, I could but I won't.
Also, I can't.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.892
I just want to know
what's going on in your life.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.981
And if this girl is
someone special to you,

04:03.025 --> 04:04.461
then she's special to me.

04:04.505 --> 04:05.767
Come on.

04:05.810 --> 04:06.855
Mary, enough.What?

04:06.898 --> 04:08.073
I want to know.

04:08.117 --> 04:08.944
Bye.

04:08.987 --> 04:10.554
If it helps,
I don't care.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.121
It does. Thank you.

04:13.122 --> 04:14.993
Why doesn't he
tell me anything?

04:15.037 --> 04:17.779
When you were a teenager, did
you tell your parents stuff?

04:17.822 --> 04:18.997
Well, no.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.564
Then why do you
expect him to?

04:20.608 --> 04:22.566
'Cause I'm a cool, fun mom.

04:26.048 --> 04:28.180
Dad, good news.
Airline tickets to California

04:28.224 --> 04:30.313
are more affordable
than you think.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.662
Sheldon, we're
not going.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.055
What's all this about?

04:33.098 --> 04:35.318
Stephen Hawking is giving
a lecture at Caltech.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.233
If we leave on Wednesday and are
willing to make four layovers,

04:37.277 --> 04:39.975
in Boise, Denver,
Albuquerque and Fargo,

04:40.018 --> 04:42.456
we can get there
for only $95 each.

04:42.499 --> 04:45.154
I have a job-- I can't just
leave in the middle of the week.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.156
W-Well, then what about Mom?

04:47.199 --> 04:50.072
Sorry, Shelly, we're not
in a position to do this.

04:50.115 --> 04:51.987
But Stephen Hawking's my hero.

04:52.030 --> 04:54.685
Imagine if you got a chance
to see Jesus or...

04:54.729 --> 04:57.035
Dad got to meet the man
who invented beer.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.826
Someone's Underoos are
in a knot.

05:04.869 --> 05:07.350
My Underoos are fitting
just fine, thank you.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.396
Then why is there a stick
up your butt?

05:09.439 --> 05:11.398
Stop making inquiries
about my bottom.

05:11.441 --> 05:12.921
But I enjoy it.

05:12.964 --> 05:15.053
Mom and Dad won't take me
to California

05:15.097 --> 05:16.620
to see Stephen Hawking.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.013
You thought they would take you

05:18.056 --> 05:20.058
to California?Yes.

05:20.102 --> 05:21.843
They wouldn't even buy me
this book at the book fair.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.801
I had to get it at the library.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.064
There's a booger
on one of the pages.

05:26.108 --> 05:28.937
Well, I may never get another
chance to see him in person.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.113
Suck it up. You always get
everything you want.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.593
That's not true.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.856
You got a computer.

05:34.899 --> 05:37.075
I'm reading a booger book.Fine.

05:37.119 --> 05:38.686
How do you recommend
I "suck it up"?

05:38.729 --> 05:40.470
I don't know,
when you don't get your way,

05:40.514 --> 05:41.950
shut up and move on.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.952
Is that what you do?Yeah.

05:43.995 --> 05:46.084
And that's why you
don't have a computer.

05:55.964 --> 05:58.183
Georgie is my son--
I have the right

05:58.227 --> 06:00.969
to know who he's
spending time with.

06:01.012 --> 06:02.449
You talking about Jana?

06:02.492 --> 06:04.015
You know her?

06:04.059 --> 06:05.626
Well, I don't
really knowher.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.976
I've seen them hanging out
together at Dale's store

06:08.019 --> 06:09.107
a couple of times.

06:09.151 --> 06:10.370
She's cute.

06:10.413 --> 06:13.460
Great. So you know
even more than I do.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.418
Always have.

06:15.462 --> 06:18.639
I don't feel
I'm being out of line

06:18.682 --> 06:20.205
wanting to...

06:20.249 --> 06:22.469
know how old this girl is

06:22.512 --> 06:25.950
or what church she goes to
or her last name.

06:25.994 --> 06:26.951
Owens.

06:27.952 --> 06:30.302
What? Now you know.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.435
Unbelievable!

06:32.479 --> 06:34.306
Oh, geez, you worry

06:34.350 --> 06:36.004
about Sheldon not being normal,

06:36.047 --> 06:38.006
now you're worried
about Georgie beingnormal--

06:38.049 --> 06:39.877
how did I raise such a turd?

06:39.921 --> 06:41.444
I am not...

06:41.488 --> 06:43.098
that word.

06:43.141 --> 06:46.884
If you can't say the word,
you might be the word.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.191
Hmm.

06:52.542 --> 06:55.676
ADULT SHELDON: Over the next few days, I tried to take my sister's advice

06:55.719 --> 06:57.068
and "suck it up."

06:57.112 --> 06:58.722
But how could I,

06:58.766 --> 07:01.290
when everything reminded me
of Stephen Hawking?

07:03.466 --> 07:05.425
Hmm.

07:09.298 --> 07:12.867
AUTOMATED VOICE:
L-E-A-R-N.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.086
That is correct.
Now spell...

07:15.130 --> 07:16.392
Oh, dear!

07:21.441 --> 07:23.399
GEORGE JR.: It's actually
a shampoo for ladies,

07:23.443 --> 07:25.836
but my hair just responds to it.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.667
JANA: So, what are you doing
Friday night?

07:30.711 --> 07:31.929
GEORGE JR.:
No plans.

07:31.973 --> 07:34.105
JANA: My parents
are gonna be out of town.

07:34.149 --> 07:35.977
Really?

07:36.020 --> 07:38.240
Wanna come over?

07:40.416 --> 07:43.158
My parents won't let me
if your folks ain't there.

07:44.246 --> 07:45.203
JANA:
Okay.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.990
Uh, but I guess
I don't have to tell 'em.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.340
JANA:
Cool.

07:51.383 --> 07:53.342
STURGIS:
Okay, that's it.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.649
ADULT SHELDON:
Nothing was able to shake me
from my doldrums,

07:55.692 --> 07:59.217
not even Dr. Sturgis's
jaunty new sweater-vest.

07:59.261 --> 08:00.654
Sheldon?

08:00.697 --> 08:02.133
Yes?

08:02.177 --> 08:04.005
You seem distracted.

08:04.048 --> 08:07.530
I really wanted to see Stephen
Hawking speak at Caltech,

08:07.574 --> 08:10.054
but my parents
can't afford the trip.

08:10.098 --> 08:11.882
That's too bad.

08:11.926 --> 08:14.537
Dr. H puts on
a heck of a show.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.147
I believe it.

08:16.191 --> 08:20.195
Would it make you feel better
to know this vest is reversible?

08:20.238 --> 08:22.110
A little. Thanks.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.459
Wait.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.983
I may be able to help
you with Hawking.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.550
Really?

08:27.594 --> 08:32.033
This vest is not the only thing
that's full of surprises.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.907
Where ya goin'?

08:36.951 --> 08:38.082
Out.

08:38.126 --> 08:39.562
Out where?

08:39.606 --> 08:40.694
Jana's.

08:40.737 --> 08:42.696
Her parents gonna be there?

08:42.739 --> 08:44.349
Yep.Okay.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.134
Let me just call and make sure.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.266
Owens.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.399
Owens.

08:50.442 --> 08:52.488
That's her last name,
right? Owens?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.359
Why are you being so weird?

08:54.403 --> 08:56.797
I'm not being weird.
Are you?

08:56.840 --> 08:58.276
No.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.670
Good. No one's being weird.

09:00.714 --> 09:01.889
Don't call 'em.

09:01.932 --> 09:03.281
Why not?

09:03.325 --> 09:04.892
Why can't you just trust me?

09:07.982 --> 09:10.201
Because I know
that you're lying.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.203
What? No, I'm not.

09:12.247 --> 09:14.205
I heard you
on the phone with Jana.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.207
You spied on me?

09:16.251 --> 09:18.296
I didn't mean to,
but I'm glad that I did,

09:18.340 --> 09:19.820
because you just lied
to my face.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.343
You are not going anywhere.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.650
Try and stop me.

09:23.693 --> 09:26.566
You walk out that door,
and your father gets involved.

09:30.265 --> 09:32.267
I don't need this.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.361
Dang.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.279
Dad.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.498
You missed everything.What happened?

09:46.542 --> 09:48.588
Georgie lied to Mom
to be alone at Jana's house,

09:48.631 --> 09:51.155
but Mom knew 'cause she
listened in on his phone call.

09:51.199 --> 09:52.504
Oh, boy.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.158
Now he's grounded
and everyone's mad.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.160
Not me. I'm super happy.

09:56.204 --> 09:58.293
Well... bye.

09:58.336 --> 10:01.949
Dad, the university offered to
pay for us to go to California!

10:01.992 --> 10:04.212
They're even putting us up
in a hotel.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.648
You're kidding.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.041
We're going to California?

10:07.084 --> 10:08.259
No, just me and Dad.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.132
That's fair.

10:11.175 --> 10:13.308
I'm so happy for you.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.266
ADULT SHELDON:
Sometimes sarcasm

10:15.310 --> 10:17.181
was laid on so thick

10:17.225 --> 10:18.269
even I could detect it.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.184
Thanks!

10:20.228 --> 10:23.231
ADULT SHELDON: This was not
one of those times.

10:23.274 --> 10:24.928
I see.

10:24.972 --> 10:27.104
Well, no, that makes sense.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.324
Okay, John, thanks.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.631
Bye.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.111
Sheldon was right.

10:34.155 --> 10:36.331
They're offerin' to pay
for the whole trip.

10:36.374 --> 10:37.201
Why?

10:37.245 --> 10:38.942
Sturgis talked to his boss,

10:38.986 --> 10:41.510
and they really want to keep
Sheldon goin' to school there.

10:41.553 --> 10:44.208
I guess I could take him.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.732
Why you?

10:45.775 --> 10:47.385
He asked me first.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.518
I'm mad at Georgie right now.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.868
It'd be good for us
to have some space.

10:51.912 --> 10:53.609
So, you pick a fight
with Georgie,

10:53.653 --> 10:55.306
and I don't get to go
to California?

10:56.743 --> 10:59.310
Fine, you can go.

10:59.354 --> 11:00.747
Thank you.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.271
Have fun managing Sheldon's
bathroom schedule

11:03.314 --> 11:05.447
in different time zones.

11:15.457 --> 11:19.200
Let me get a picture of my boys
before their big trip.

11:19.243 --> 11:20.680
It's smart to document this.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.682
Next time you see me,
I'll have been in the presence

11:22.725 --> 11:24.205
of Stephen Hawking.

11:24.248 --> 11:25.902
Smile.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.338
I'd prefer to look serious.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.950
This may appear
in a textbook someday.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.995
Say, "Stephen Hawking."

11:32.039 --> 11:33.823
Stephen Hawking.Stephen Hawking.

11:33.867 --> 11:36.870
SHELDON:
Aw, you made me smile.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.485
Wash up for dinner.

11:43.528 --> 11:44.747
I ain't eatin'.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.749
Well, you're not watchin' TV.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.317
I can't leave the house,
and now I can't watch TV.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.146
Yeah, it's called
being grounded.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.107
I can't wait to move out.

11:57.151 --> 11:58.326
What was that?!

11:58.369 --> 12:00.154
Next time, I'll say it
on the phone,

12:00.197 --> 12:02.112
so you can hear me.

12:06.813 --> 12:09.467
You keep frownin' like that,
you're gonna get wrinkles

12:09.511 --> 12:11.208
like your meemaw.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.862
You look great.

12:12.906 --> 12:16.126
I know, I just wanted
to hear you say it.

12:17.693 --> 12:20.696
What's on your mind?

12:20.740 --> 12:23.351
Sheldon always gets
everything he wants.

12:23.394 --> 12:25.222
I guess he does.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.442
That's not fair, huh?

12:27.485 --> 12:28.791
No!

12:28.835 --> 12:30.532
On the other hand, he's just

12:30.575 --> 12:33.274
going to some science lecture.

12:33.317 --> 12:37.278
I know, but he gets to go
on a plane to California.

12:37.321 --> 12:38.453
Planes aren't
all that great.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.977
You can't even smoke
on 'em anymore.

12:41.021 --> 12:42.326
I tell you what,

12:42.370 --> 12:43.501
after practice today,

12:43.545 --> 12:45.590
you and me will do
somethin' fun.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.462
Can I have my first cigarette?

12:47.505 --> 12:48.680
No!

12:49.725 --> 12:51.292
Can I get
my ears pierced?

12:51.335 --> 12:52.728
Your mom won't like that.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.818
So, maybe.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.352
All right, 34A and B--
this is us.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.398
All right, you want the
aisle or the window?

13:10.441 --> 13:11.703
Which one is
assigned to me?

13:11.747 --> 13:13.488
It doesn't matter,
just pick one.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.316
Well, if I sit by the window,
I can watch the takeoff

13:15.359 --> 13:17.448
and landing,
but if I sit on the aisle,

13:17.492 --> 13:19.407
I'm closer to the bathroom.

13:19.450 --> 13:20.669
Here we go.

13:20.712 --> 13:21.713
Although if I'm by the window,
you'll have

13:21.757 --> 13:23.759
to get up when I use
the bathroom.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.152
But if I'm not,
I'll have

13:25.195 --> 13:26.849
to get up when youuse
the bathroom.

13:26.893 --> 13:27.850
Just pick one.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.199
It's a tricky decision.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.418
My bladder's smaller
than yours...

13:30.461 --> 13:32.289
Everything okay here?

13:32.333 --> 13:33.725
About to be.

13:33.769 --> 13:34.944
Here!

13:34.988 --> 13:36.076
Aisle it is!

13:36.119 --> 13:37.164
We're good.

13:37.207 --> 13:38.730
Oh, okay.

13:42.343 --> 13:44.171
You want to help
me with this?

13:44.214 --> 13:45.346
No.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.435
Hey!

13:47.478 --> 13:49.219
You're the one who lied to me.

13:49.263 --> 13:53.310
Well, I'm done talkin' to you,
so it'll never happen again.

13:57.227 --> 13:58.489
What?

13:58.533 --> 14:00.317
I know you don't want to talk,
and that's fine.

14:00.361 --> 14:03.059
You can just listen.

14:03.103 --> 14:07.150
Life is hard enough
if you make good decisions,

14:07.194 --> 14:10.371
but if you make bad ones,
it gets even harder.

14:10.414 --> 14:12.634
Nothin' was gonna happen
with Jana.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.244
Georgie...
No!

14:14.288 --> 14:15.767
You always assume
the worst with me.

14:15.811 --> 14:18.640
I'm sorry you were a perfect kid
and I'm just a screwup.

14:18.683 --> 14:21.382
You are not a screwup.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.776
And I was not a perfect kid.

14:24.820 --> 14:27.518
Oh, what'd you do, sleep
through church one mornin'?

14:29.129 --> 14:31.914
For your information...

14:31.958 --> 14:34.699
I used to skip class...

14:34.743 --> 14:36.353
so that I could

14:36.397 --> 14:38.312
drink beer

14:38.355 --> 14:40.357
in my boyfriend's truck.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.578
Dad had a truck back then?

14:43.621 --> 14:46.189
Not talkin' about your dad.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.017
Whoa.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.066
I also...

14:53.109 --> 14:55.242
stole your
meemaw's car

14:55.285 --> 14:57.679
and crashed it
into a ditch.

14:57.722 --> 14:58.810
Really?

14:58.854 --> 15:00.290
With that boyfriend
who wasn't Dad?

15:00.334 --> 15:02.118
Missin' the point!If the point is

15:02.162 --> 15:04.381
you made some bad decisions
and turned out fine,

15:04.425 --> 15:06.122
then why you being
so hard on me?

15:06.166 --> 15:09.909
Because some decisions
you cannot walk away from

15:09.952 --> 15:12.433
and they will affect
the rest of your life.

15:12.476 --> 15:13.608
If you're talkin' about
Jana getting pregnant,

15:13.651 --> 15:15.044
she ain't gonna.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.699
That is what I thought,
and the next thing I know,

15:17.742 --> 15:19.919
I'm at the courthouse
gettin' married.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.312
You got married

15:22.356 --> 15:23.748
because you were pregnant?

15:27.274 --> 15:28.928
Yes.

15:30.233 --> 15:32.105
So, I was a mistake?

15:32.148 --> 15:34.150
No! No!

15:35.369 --> 15:37.371
You are a blessin'.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.503
The mistake

15:39.547 --> 15:42.245
was lyin' to my parents,
so that I could spend

15:42.289 --> 15:45.379
the night at your dad's house.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.555
And, you know, tequila.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.426
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

15:49.470 --> 15:52.038
We're expecting a smooth
flight to Los Angeles.

15:52.081 --> 15:54.475
Before we take off,
please direct your attention

15:54.518 --> 15:56.346
to the flight attendants
as they review

15:56.390 --> 15:58.435
some important
safety procedures.

15:58.479 --> 16:01.047
"Safety procedures"?
Oh, baby.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.049
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Take a minute to locate

16:03.092 --> 16:04.920
the exit closest to you.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.748
The nearest exit
could be behind you.

16:06.791 --> 16:08.532
Should the cabin
experience

16:08.576 --> 16:11.231
sudden pressure loss,
oxygen masks will

16:11.274 --> 16:12.928
drop down
from above your seat...

16:12.972 --> 16:15.017
Why would the cabin
lose pressure?

16:15.061 --> 16:17.541
It won't.Place the mask over
your mouth and nose,

16:17.585 --> 16:20.762
like this, pull the strap
to tighten it.

16:20.805 --> 16:23.330
If you are traveling with
children, make sure that your

16:23.373 --> 16:26.159
own mask is on first
before helping your child...

16:26.202 --> 16:28.378
I don't like this at all.

16:28.422 --> 16:29.814
It's just a precaution.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.034
You know...
perfectly safe.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.644
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
In the unlikely event

16:33.688 --> 16:35.733
of a water landing
and evacuation...

16:35.777 --> 16:39.041
: Water landing, water
landing, water landing...

16:39.085 --> 16:40.260
I can't do this.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.528
Keep going,
we'll be right back.

16:47.571 --> 16:48.833
Uh, sir?!

16:48.877 --> 16:51.358
Sheldon, come out of there!No!

16:51.401 --> 16:53.664
At least open the door.

16:54.752 --> 16:56.754
Tell them I need to get off.

16:56.798 --> 16:58.365
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Sir?

16:58.408 --> 17:00.062
You both need
to return to your seats.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.977
Just one second.

17:02.021 --> 17:02.978
Sir. Sir...

17:04.849 --> 17:06.373
If you want to see
Stephen Hawking,

17:06.416 --> 17:08.592
we have to sit down right now.

17:08.636 --> 17:11.117
It's too dangerous. I can't!It's okay to be scared.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.162
Sir?Th-That's when you got
to dig deep and be brave.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.121
So, what do you say?

17:15.164 --> 17:17.514
No, I'm your terrified
little boy!

17:17.558 --> 17:18.950
Okay.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.865
Sir, please, they're
gonna call security!

17:20.909 --> 17:21.997
Just one more second.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.435
Mr. Spock!

17:25.479 --> 17:27.872
He flies around all the time
in that spaceship.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.744
He's not afraid, is he?

17:29.787 --> 17:31.615
I'm not Mr. Spock.

17:31.659 --> 17:34.792
No, but-but I've seen you
pretend to be him.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.491
Could you do that right now?

17:37.534 --> 17:39.884
You be Spock, I'll be Kirk.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.889
Maybe.

17:44.933 --> 17:48.241
Okay, Mr. Spock.

17:48.284 --> 17:51.461
Your first order
is to return to your seat.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.595
Aye, Captain.

17:56.945 --> 17:58.947
CAPTAIN: Flight attendants,
prepare for takeoff.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.561
You okay, Mr. Spock?

18:04.605 --> 18:06.607
Doing my best, sir.

18:11.525 --> 18:14.658
The captain and Mr. Spock
don't hold hands.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.704
Sorry.

18:25.278 --> 18:27.758
Okay, maybe just
this once.

18:47.256 --> 18:49.867
I think we've been lied to
about California.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.087
No one on this campus
is tan at all.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.438
No, they are not.

18:57.745 --> 19:00.748
Imagine all the stimulating
conversations

19:00.791 --> 19:02.837
that must go on at these tables.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.360
I bet.

19:05.970 --> 19:09.060
I can see myself
going here one day.

19:09.104 --> 19:12.107
I think you'd fit
right in.
