02:54.135 --> 02:56.970
Tell me, why are you here?

02:58.472 --> 03:00.908
I'm here to become a student.

03:01.008 --> 03:04.978
I need to learn how to meditate,
how to control my thoughts,

03:05.078 --> 03:07.814
and where they happen.

03:08.064 --> 03:10.967
Why do you need to learn this?

03:11.317 --> 03:13.419
I've done something.

03:14.019 --> 03:16.218
Something very bad.

03:19.589 --> 03:22.269
And I need to set it right.

04:20.978 --> 04:23.282
Let me take care of dinner tonight.

04:23.382 --> 04:27.516
- I've got an extra sausage.
- How could I turn down charm like that?

04:29.419 --> 04:33.289
- I'm serious.
- I'm tired.

04:33.389 --> 04:35.491
Yeah, but tonight, I mean.

04:35.591 --> 04:38.335
I'll be more tired after work.

04:42.062 --> 04:44.499
Let's go out, then.

04:45.349 --> 04:48.201
You work too much. We could ask
your mom to take care of Lana.

04:48.301 --> 04:51.535
We could go to that Thai place
that you really like.

04:58.809 --> 05:00.610
Fine.

05:04.581 --> 05:07.117
Won't the paper burn when it explodes?

05:07.217 --> 05:10.019
It's not that kind of explosion.

05:10.119 --> 05:12.855
We're going to make a chemical reaction.

05:12.955 --> 05:15.777
What's a chemical reaction?

05:16.757 --> 05:18.226
It's kind of like magic.

05:18.326 --> 05:21.284
- Cool.
- Yeah.

05:28.533 --> 05:30.758
There you go, Grams.

05:47.217 --> 05:51.021
- Let's roll, gangsta.
- What, what!

05:51.121 --> 05:52.355
- Seriously?
- Shut up.

05:52.455 --> 05:54.779
Such a dork.

06:05.231 --> 06:07.867
For example, the subject is asked
to think about Marilyn Monroe.

06:07.967 --> 06:10.669
My study suggests
not only conscious control

06:10.769 --> 06:13.638
in the hippocampus
and parahippocampal cortex...

06:13.738 --> 06:17.341
Hey, did you hear about
the new bioengineering transfer?

06:17.441 --> 06:21.844
My friend's in her class. He says on a scale
of one to ten, she's a lemniscate.

06:21.944 --> 06:24.435
But also...

06:24.979 --> 06:29.282
Mr. Thorogood, perhaps you could
enlighten us all with Ryan's gossip

06:29.382 --> 06:33.419
or tell us what else we can conclude
with this study?

06:33.919 --> 06:39.679
We can conclude that all neurosurgeons
are in love with Marilyn Monroe.

06:42.591 --> 06:46.328
A single neuron has not only the ability
to carry complex code and abstract form

06:46.428 --> 06:49.597
but is also able to override sensory input
through cognitive effort.

06:49.697 --> 06:54.033
It suggests thought is a stronger reality
than the world around us.

06:54.133 --> 06:57.992
Unfortunately,
I think you're both correct.

06:59.756 --> 07:01.471
Dude, that's bullcrap.

07:01.571 --> 07:05.041
I'm telling you, man,
brains out-duels brawn every time.

07:05.141 --> 07:09.244
It's not just brawn. He's the most powerful
character in any universe. He's unbeatable.

07:09.344 --> 07:11.868
Except for kryptonite.

07:13.045 --> 07:15.949
- Blanket?
- He could only win if he fought dirty.

07:16.049 --> 07:18.817
If Supes took a sucker punch,
it'd be over just as easy.

07:18.917 --> 07:21.986
Say, no warning, they're both
just teleported into a cage match.

07:22.086 --> 07:25.940
It doesn't matter. Batman keeps
kryptonite in his utility belt.

07:29.223 --> 07:31.660
Man, oh, man, give me some gloves.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.151
Those Bunsen burners
are too hot to handle.

07:35.829 --> 07:37.864
- Dude, did you just see that?
- See what?

07:37.964 --> 07:40.366
She totally just checked me out.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

07:40.466 --> 07:45.002
- Not now. I'm...
- Hey. I'm Ryan.

07:45.102 --> 07:47.804
I know. We have chemistry together.

07:47.904 --> 07:49.962
Slow down.

08:00.982 --> 08:03.452
- David Thorogood?
- Yeah?

08:03.552 --> 08:07.305
You missed your rent payments for November
and January. I'm here to collect.

08:07.405 --> 08:10.658
No, I talked to Stan.
He's our landlord, and he...

08:10.758 --> 08:13.060
- He handed the situation over to us.
- No, he said...

08:13.160 --> 08:17.549
You owe 5,690. Late fees included.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.258
Is that a new computer, David?

08:36.178 --> 08:37.635
Damn it.

08:40.414 --> 08:43.051
David, I'd like you to meet Jordan.

08:43.150 --> 08:45.936
- Hi.
- Dave's my best friend, business partner,

08:46.036 --> 08:49.295
and the second smartest person
I know after yours truly.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.390
- Nice to meet you.
- Dude, what are you doing?

08:51.490 --> 08:53.425
Just wait a minute.
I know what you're going to say.

08:53.525 --> 08:56.271
I'm sorry. We have to talk for just a minute.
Do you mind waiting outside?

08:56.371 --> 08:58.819
Sorry, babe, one sec.

09:00.630 --> 09:03.133
- You told her about our research.
- Yeah, 'cause she's assigned...

09:03.233 --> 09:05.275
- You just met this girl. If it gets out...
- I know...

09:05.375 --> 09:07.532
You're the one that said it has
to stay secret to remain valuable.

09:07.636 --> 09:11.004
If the school finds out, if they even suspect,
I cannot afford to lose my financial aid.

09:11.104 --> 09:12.273
- You said...
- I know what I said.

09:12.373 --> 09:15.807
My own wife doesn't even know what we're
doing. No girls, man. That was your rule.

09:15.907 --> 09:18.442
- All she's gotta do is make one phone call...
- She's not going to.

09:18.542 --> 09:21.577
...about some missing equipment,
unauthorized experiments, and that's it.

09:21.677 --> 09:23.901
We're done!

09:28.415 --> 09:30.918
Everything all right with Mel?

09:31.018 --> 09:33.353
You want to tell me
what's really going on?

09:33.453 --> 09:35.710
Shut up.

09:42.993 --> 09:47.197
Now will you just listen for a minute, okay?
Jordan might just look like a hot body,

09:47.297 --> 09:50.427
but she's assigned to Professor Hamamoto's
experiments with ATP powered,

09:50.527 --> 09:54.770
cell-powering nanotube devices.
Let's give her a peek, see what she says.

09:54.870 --> 09:57.972
We'll make her sign a nondisclosure
agreement and the whole nine yards, okay?

09:58.072 --> 10:02.456
She doesn't know we've borrowed lab equipment
so you don't have to worry about that.

10:14.985 --> 10:16.119
I've seen this before.

10:16.219 --> 10:19.755
Accuracy takes a nose dive once the word
library goes over 80 or 90 words.

10:19.855 --> 10:22.924
We're averaging almost 90% accuracy.

10:23.024 --> 10:25.494
Most EEG nets track less than 100 neurons.

10:25.594 --> 10:29.663
My compact electrode design
lets us track almost 1,000.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.066
How many words does it recognize?

10:32.166 --> 10:35.515
2,486.

10:37.035 --> 10:38.504
Holy shit.

10:38.604 --> 10:42.728
Military applications are obvious? DARPA's
been trying to get this to work for years.

10:42.828 --> 10:45.910
- Cell phones themselves will become obsolete.
- But we are nowhere near there yet.

10:46.010 --> 10:48.977
It's tedious. It's like training
voice-recognition software

10:49.077 --> 10:51.334
from scratch with a stutterer.

10:51.784 --> 10:53.653
Yeah.

10:54.015 --> 10:56.151
And response time is slow.

10:56.251 --> 10:58.467
Exactly. It's...

11:01.254 --> 11:03.590
Your mind can have a dozen
thoughts in a millisecond,

11:03.690 --> 11:08.194
but it takes you five seconds
to say, "Hi, sexy"?

11:08.294 --> 11:10.563
- It's not perfect.
- It's crap.

11:10.663 --> 11:13.432
You're proud of measuring 1,000 neurons?

11:13.532 --> 11:16.802
You're trying to read the contents of an
entire library by walking through the aisles.

11:16.902 --> 11:19.203
You gotta open the books to know
what's really going on inside.

11:19.303 --> 11:22.906
- We're not neurosurgeons.
- You don't need surgery.

11:23.006 --> 11:26.776
You need nanotubes.
We can create molecular electrodes

11:26.876 --> 11:30.379
by embedding carbon nanotubes
into microscopic transistors

11:30.479 --> 11:33.582
that can bond
with every neuron in your brain.

11:33.682 --> 11:36.918
So you can decode signal
from 1,000 electrodes, so what?

11:37.018 --> 11:41.285
What are you gonna do with 100 billion?

11:44.757 --> 11:47.040
I told you.

12:03.039 --> 12:05.258
Next suggestion.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.240
Yes, sir.

12:25.223 --> 12:26.666
Sit.

12:36.200 --> 12:39.326
Good boy, Bubba. Good boy.

13:08.732 --> 13:11.194
- Oh, hi.
- Who are you?

13:11.294 --> 13:15.338
I'm Jordan. Oh, you must be David's wife.

13:15.438 --> 13:18.240
- David?
- Yeah?

13:18.340 --> 13:20.389
David?

13:23.376 --> 13:26.160
Hey, Mel, you look amazing.

13:38.221 --> 13:40.606
Who is that?

13:42.825 --> 13:46.710
It's Ryan's friend.
She's helping us out now.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.180
Well, are you ready?

13:55.235 --> 13:58.339
Listen, we had a significant breakthrough.

13:58.439 --> 14:01.674
Things are just changing so fast.
We really need this right now, like...

14:01.774 --> 14:03.656
So?

14:05.343 --> 14:10.929
Could we just... could we just
do this another night, please?

14:14.468 --> 14:16.750
Yeah, sure.

14:17.952 --> 14:20.700
It wasn't a big deal anyway.

14:23.456 --> 14:26.193
You look really nice.

14:26.293 --> 14:28.075
Did you get a haircut?

14:43.675 --> 14:46.726
Hey, man. How's it going?

14:47.645 --> 14:50.198
I'm just getting something to drink.

14:52.482 --> 14:54.385
You need a ride home or something?

14:54.485 --> 14:58.102
Nah, it's cool actually.
I think Jordan can take me.

15:03.757 --> 15:07.244
So how's your grandma doing?

15:08.028 --> 15:09.397
It is what it is.

15:09.497 --> 15:12.983
If I could afford a doctor, they'd probably
find a million things wrong with her.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.140
You know what?

15:18.302 --> 15:20.572
Why don't you take some fruit for her?

15:20.672 --> 15:24.306
- Come on, man. You don't have to do that.
- It's fine.

15:26.142 --> 15:27.992
Here.

15:31.947 --> 15:35.584
We're gonna bust this thing open soon.
You know that?

15:35.684 --> 15:37.712
You know it.

15:41.956 --> 15:45.075
Got you some <i>carne asada</i>, Grams.

16:04.042 --> 16:05.993
No, I ate.

16:27.332 --> 16:31.999
- They're beautiful.
- All right. Let's do this.

16:33.769 --> 16:35.689
- Where did this come from again?
- Stop stalling.

16:35.789 --> 16:38.258
You should feel numb pretty quick.

16:39.308 --> 16:43.745
- Why do I have to do the injections again?
- Because, if we need a second test subject,

16:43.845 --> 16:47.922
I don't want you injecting me
without practicing first.

16:49.015 --> 16:52.919
- Here you go.
- Holy crap, that's big.

16:53.019 --> 16:54.787
- That's what she said.
- Really?

16:54.887 --> 16:56.889
That's your contribution
to this situation right now?

16:56.989 --> 16:59.190
Relax, you're gonna screw up
if you're all tense like that.

16:59.290 --> 17:01.980
- Just get ready.
- I'm ready.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.760
- Give me your hand.
- Okay.

17:03.860 --> 17:05.271
- You feel those two bumps?
- Yeah.

17:05.371 --> 17:07.496
Those are his L-three
and L-four vertebrae.

17:07.596 --> 17:10.798
You want to stick the needle in
the space just between those two.

17:10.897 --> 17:14.791
You should feel a give right away,
otherwise you're in the wrong spot.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.530
Okay.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.492
I can't do this.

17:34.951 --> 17:36.186
I don't like this.

17:36.286 --> 17:39.555
The computers I could justify somehow.
They've got tons of computers.

17:39.655 --> 17:42.258
You didn't like injecting me
blind either, now, did you?

17:42.358 --> 17:45.226
- This will let you see what you're doing.
- We should be doing this at night.

17:45.326 --> 17:48.420
It's more suspicious at night.
Plus everything's locked up.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.980
Don't worry. No one would ever
expect a fluoroscope to be stolen.

17:51.080 --> 17:54.350
Somebody's definitely
gonna notice when it's gone.

17:54.450 --> 17:57.533
That was easy. Grab the blanket.

18:06.010 --> 18:07.589
How you doing?

18:14.316 --> 18:16.553
You're insane.

18:17.178 --> 18:21.428
Hey, kiddo, I think it's time
for you to paint your volcano.

18:23.949 --> 18:26.324
- Will you paint it with me?
- I tell you what,

18:26.424 --> 18:31.836
how about you paint it, and then later
I can show you how to make it explode?

18:33.256 --> 18:34.639
Okay.

18:39.261 --> 18:40.796
All right.

18:40.896 --> 18:42.955
Here you go.

18:47.100 --> 18:49.250
You got it?

18:55.256 --> 18:56.525
Awesome.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.627
Shouldn't we be wearing
lead vests or something?

18:58.727 --> 19:00.573
Probably.

19:10.220 --> 19:11.721
- All right.
- Thanks.

19:11.821 --> 19:14.990
- You know what you're doing?
- Yeah.

19:15.090 --> 19:19.761
Just talk about something else,
so I don't get all freaked out, okay?

19:19.861 --> 19:22.110
We can do that.

19:25.597 --> 19:28.801
So... Ryan...

19:29.601 --> 19:32.317
why don't we ever go to your place?

19:33.069 --> 19:37.954
- I only bring girlfriends to my place.
- You don't want me to be your girlfriend?

19:38.541 --> 19:41.376
I live in a tiny studio apartment
with my grandma.

19:41.476 --> 19:44.412
Not exactly the glamorous lifestyle.

19:44.512 --> 19:46.979
What about your parents?

19:48.698 --> 19:51.462
My mom died when I was 16.

19:52.068 --> 19:54.123
I'm sorry.

19:54.223 --> 19:55.955
What happened?

19:56.055 --> 19:58.257
She'd been sick for a long time.

19:58.357 --> 20:01.840
It was one of those awesome,
slow, agonizing cancers.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.127
- What was that?
- No, it's okay.

20:04.227 --> 20:07.503
You broke through the arachnoid matter.
It means you're in.

20:08.462 --> 20:10.645
Keep talking.

20:11.964 --> 20:15.249
My... dad...

20:16.534 --> 20:19.384
remarried about a month later.

20:22.004 --> 20:25.008
Turned out he'd been cheating
the whole time.

20:25.408 --> 20:28.478
Told me he had a new family now

20:28.578 --> 20:32.014
and that his dead wife's kid and grandma

20:32.114 --> 20:35.117
were no longer his responsibility.

20:35.717 --> 20:37.599
That's it.

20:39.118 --> 20:41.888
- Done.
- Thanks for telling me that.

20:41.988 --> 20:47.222
Whatever, I was just trying to keep Dr. Pansy
here from cracking under the pressure.

20:47.958 --> 20:50.475
No, you weren't.

20:59.769 --> 21:01.370
How long does he have to hang like that?

21:01.470 --> 21:05.407
Long enough for gravity to take
the nanotubes into his brain.

21:05.507 --> 21:08.176
And... how long is that?

21:08.276 --> 21:12.360
I don't know.
No one's ever done this before.

21:19.017 --> 21:20.903
You're back.

21:21.153 --> 21:23.589
Just for a little bit.

21:23.689 --> 21:26.572
I'm picking up Angela's shift later.

21:42.439 --> 21:44.309
Where's...

21:44.609 --> 21:46.991
where's Lana?

21:47.343 --> 21:49.646
She's in the bathroom.

21:49.846 --> 21:52.396
She was covered in paint.

21:58.219 --> 22:02.473
- Where is the TV?
- We needed it in the garage.

22:02.573 --> 22:04.327
Right.

22:20.438 --> 22:24.642
Okay, I'll admit it. If this thing works,
I'll be thoroughly impressed.

22:24.742 --> 22:28.878
And don't you forget it. But if it cooks my
brain, you just remember my glory days.

22:28.978 --> 22:32.280
Yeah. Spent in a garage
playing with yourself.

22:32.380 --> 22:34.589
Okay, how are we gonna know
that this thing is working?

22:34.689 --> 22:37.217
Ryan's thoughts should appear
on this output screen here.

22:37.317 --> 22:42.623
- Let's start the party!
- All right, here we go.

22:46.858 --> 22:49.574
Please, God, don't let him die.

23:13.516 --> 23:15.866
Ryan? Ryan? You okay?

23:15.966 --> 23:18.821
- I'm fine. Careful with that.
- Okay, what just happened?

23:18.921 --> 23:21.923
The array struggled to enumerate the number
of electrode cycles flowing through,

23:22.023 --> 23:24.429
let alone to analyze the input frequencies.
I'll have to apportion the feed

23:24.529 --> 23:28.397
to sector designated processors before we're
able to fathom a conscious filter algorithm.

23:29.894 --> 23:31.963
It means it worked.

23:44.956 --> 23:48.623
Sir, it's one of the university leads.

23:50.776 --> 23:52.727
They've shown progress.

24:09.928 --> 24:12.479
That'll be all, Gates.

24:23.073 --> 24:26.596
Next suggestion: "Kill the dog."

24:43.759 --> 24:45.661
Suggest:

24:45.761 --> 24:48.111
"I want to kill the dog."

24:54.801 --> 24:57.584
"I must kill my dog."

25:04.775 --> 25:08.459
"I have to kill my dog.
My life depends on it."

25:24.258 --> 25:26.522
We need something new.

25:31.231 --> 25:33.113
Trace.

25:34.766 --> 25:36.135
Track.

25:36.635 --> 25:38.517
Traction.

25:39.269 --> 25:41.205
Tractor.

25:41.905 --> 25:43.758
Trade.

25:46.458 --> 25:47.841
Trademark.

25:50.879 --> 25:52.928
Tradition.

25:57.150 --> 25:59.785
Well, the system, it isn't crashing,
which is really good news.

25:59.885 --> 26:02.687
How is any of this good news?

26:02.787 --> 26:05.613
That we found a couple of words
in the feed. It's just...

26:05.713 --> 26:09.425
It's just way more data than we thought.
It's gonna take time to decode, that's all.

26:09.525 --> 26:12.832
- How much time?
- Months? Years?

26:12.932 --> 26:14.823
- I don't know.
- It has to happen live. Real time.

26:14.923 --> 26:17.931
What's the point of a machine that reads
your thoughts a year after you have them?

26:18.031 --> 26:21.000
- It'd make a pretty nifty diary.
- Damn it! I'm not kidding.

26:21.100 --> 26:23.669
A full night's worth of data,
and all you've got is...

26:23.769 --> 26:26.986
"Hippopotamus"? "Menstruate"?

26:31.999 --> 26:34.042
I need an aspirin.

26:36.112 --> 26:39.049
Look, man, I'm... I'm sorry.

26:39.149 --> 26:43.152
There's just not a machine fast enough
to decode human thought in real time.

26:43.252 --> 26:45.921
It just... just doesn't exist.

26:46.721 --> 26:50.371
Well... there is one.

26:53.558 --> 26:54.560
No.

26:54.660 --> 26:57.471
The brain is the world's fastest computer.
Nothing else is even close.

26:57.571 --> 26:59.497
- No. No, no, no. No.
- Yes.

26:59.597 --> 27:04.448
The only thing fast enough to decode
the human brain is the human brain.

28:25.613 --> 28:29.349
- What's the worst that could happen?
- Worst-case scenario, it's too much activity,

28:29.449 --> 28:32.853
completely fries your cortex,
and you lose all cognitive ability.

28:32.953 --> 28:35.705
Relax. It's gonna be fine.
It's only a one-way connection.

28:35.805 --> 28:38.140
I'll only hear her thoughts.

28:38.490 --> 28:40.326
So...

28:41.026 --> 28:43.595
what do you think of Jordan?

28:43.695 --> 28:46.531
So what, are you guys,
like, officially dating now?

28:46.631 --> 28:50.234
No, no, nothing's happened yet.
But I like her.

28:50.334 --> 28:53.270
Like, I think she could be...

28:53.370 --> 28:57.921
I don't know, something.
She's cool, right?

29:06.246 --> 29:08.230
Ready?

29:10.033 --> 29:11.817
Damn.

29:45.850 --> 29:49.521
- Just try to think simple, clear thoughts.
- What does that mean?

29:50.971 --> 29:53.541
I have no idea.

29:54.141 --> 29:56.101
You okay?

29:56.201 --> 29:59.109
Fine. I just got dizzy for a second.

30:01.663 --> 30:05.448
- Just try and clear your mind.
- It's a blank slate.

30:09.403 --> 30:12.005
- Ten seconds.
- Don't stop it early.

30:21.381 --> 30:23.583
Don't think about DARKBIRD.

30:23.683 --> 30:28.499
I know what you want.
I understand what you've been through.

30:29.321 --> 30:31.123
It's okay.

30:31.723 --> 30:35.027
Touch me, Ryan. Love me. Feel me.

30:35.827 --> 30:38.043
I want it too.

30:40.264 --> 30:42.313
Don't let him find out.

30:45.700 --> 30:48.670
Ryan? Ryan, can you hear me? Are you okay?

30:48.770 --> 30:51.673
- I'm great.
- What happened?

30:51.773 --> 30:54.809
- It worked.
- Yeah, but what was it like?

30:55.209 --> 30:57.515
Better than sex.

31:03.481 --> 31:05.498
Ladies and gentlemen...

31:08.985 --> 31:12.225
We have just invented telepathy.

31:16.224 --> 31:18.227
Guys, she said she wanted
no cheese on the salad,

31:18.327 --> 31:20.529
and the burger's supposed to be well done.

31:20.629 --> 31:22.678
- Yeah. Don't look at me. I wrote it down.
- Yeah.

31:22.778 --> 31:24.631
- Rough night?
- Yeah. Wake me when it's over.

31:24.731 --> 31:27.214
Just getting started, girl.

31:37.339 --> 31:40.275
Honestly, man, I thought we killed you,

31:40.375 --> 31:43.370
and then I went through
the seven stages of grief in, like...

31:43.470 --> 31:47.015
- half a second, and then I was like...
- David... what is this?

31:47.115 --> 31:49.617
Hey, we're having a party!

31:49.717 --> 31:53.687
What are you doing?
Get off of me! What is this?

31:53.787 --> 31:55.869
What does it mean?

31:59.524 --> 32:02.041
It means we're being evicted.

32:07.598 --> 32:10.148
I thought you were calling the landlord.

32:14.003 --> 32:17.307
- What are you celebrating?
- That's what she said.

32:17.407 --> 32:20.151
That doesn't even make any sense.

32:23.878 --> 32:26.329
Come here, sweetie.

32:52.105 --> 32:54.588
How long do you have?

32:57.409 --> 32:59.659
Two weeks.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.105
So what are we gonna do?

33:05.115 --> 33:08.232
Get a finished product before then.

33:25.739 --> 33:28.251
Blueberries are my favorite.

33:29.738 --> 33:32.207
It's our secret what happened.

33:32.307 --> 33:34.536
I hope he doesn't find out.

33:46.283 --> 33:48.440
Keep it a secret.

33:56.156 --> 33:58.167
Take my body, David.

33:59.526 --> 34:01.539
That's enough.

34:18.375 --> 34:20.274
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

34:20.373 --> 34:22.931
I didn't mean to scare you.

34:24.313 --> 34:28.418
They said they had a pot of coffee on.
Do you mind if I...

34:28.518 --> 34:30.368
Sure.

35:13.394 --> 35:16.331
- What's this?
- We're going around in circles.

35:16.431 --> 35:19.867
- I need results. You're not giving me results.
- Well, we're making steady progress.

35:19.967 --> 35:24.704
- Every practical application has failed.
- What do you mean "practical application"?

35:24.804 --> 35:28.207
You're not field testing.
We're nowhere near ready.

35:28.307 --> 35:31.944
Exactly. We're no closer today
than we were a year ago.

35:32.944 --> 35:36.264
- What am I looking at?
- The next phase. DARKBIRD II.

35:36.514 --> 35:40.717
Looks like a couple of Caltech students
cracked the nut before you could.

35:40.817 --> 35:43.620
Well, the likelihood of that
is minimal at best.

35:43.720 --> 35:47.056
Unlikely things happen
all the time, Doctor.

35:47.156 --> 35:49.773
We make a business of it.

35:50.959 --> 35:53.710
"When she thought about it afterward,
it occurred to her

35:53.810 --> 35:56.845
that she ought to have wondered at this."

35:58.833 --> 36:02.369
"However, when the rabbit took a watch
out of his waistcoat pocket,

36:02.469 --> 36:05.705
"Alice stood silent, watching him.

36:05.805 --> 36:09.825
"Suddenly, she brightened up.
'Look! Look!' she cried."

36:10.475 --> 36:11.676
- Damn it!
- Look.

36:11.776 --> 36:14.478
I need the money more than anybody,
but it's just not ready yet.

36:14.578 --> 36:17.414
I talked to some guys who graduated
a while back. They know these venture...

36:17.514 --> 36:20.549
Ryan! It's not ready, okay?

36:20.649 --> 36:24.185
Like this whole page.
I don't remember any of this page.

36:24.485 --> 36:27.421
Yeah. I don't even remember
reading this, really.

36:27.521 --> 36:30.424
- So maybe you're reading automatically.
- What do you mean?

36:30.524 --> 36:33.392
We're tapping the part of the brain
that we think is processing metacognition.

36:33.492 --> 36:34.646
Yeah, but if I glazed over...

36:34.746 --> 36:37.645
The words keep coming out because
you know how to read instinctively.

36:37.745 --> 36:41.096
And instead, whatever it is you're
really thinking goes through the wire.

36:47.568 --> 36:51.038
- Dad?
- Yeah?

36:51.138 --> 36:55.054
Can you show me how
to make my volcano explode?

36:57.508 --> 37:00.278
Sorry, kiddo, look,
we're just really busy right now.

37:00.378 --> 37:03.319
- But the science fair is Friday.
- Okay.

37:03.419 --> 37:07.451
Look, I promise I'll show you
how to make it work before then.

37:07.551 --> 37:10.666
- Okay?
- Okay.

37:13.588 --> 37:15.691
Yeah, I'm a little more
than slightly nervous.

37:15.791 --> 37:18.974
Don't worry.
Grams actually loves visitors.

37:20.060 --> 37:22.545
Am I dressed okay?

37:23.997 --> 37:27.900
Maybe just button up
your sweater or something.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.215
Let me have it.

37:30.668 --> 37:33.037
Okay, now...

37:33.137 --> 37:37.140
It's tiny and probably a mess.
You have to promise not to judge, okay?

37:37.240 --> 37:40.843
- I promise.
- Good. Now just wait right here a sec.

37:40.943 --> 37:44.826
- I need to let Grams know you're coming.
- She doesn't know I'm coming?

37:48.014 --> 37:52.486
Grams, I brought a friend over.
Think you can get up for a bit?

37:53.086 --> 37:56.637
Grams, there's someone I want you to meet.

38:39.629 --> 38:41.131
I don't have that kind of money.

38:41.231 --> 38:45.568
That's the absolute bare minimum.
We can't do it for any less than that.

38:45.668 --> 38:48.238
I don't have any money.

38:49.338 --> 38:51.874
Isn't there any family that could...

38:52.074 --> 38:54.723
There's no family.

38:57.777 --> 39:00.428
I'm the only family.

39:07.186 --> 39:09.436
Thanks, baby.

39:10.739 --> 39:12.858
I guessed the jelly beans.

39:12.958 --> 39:15.260
Professor Thompson wanted to prove
the jelly bean experiment.

39:15.360 --> 39:19.730
You know, like we're in fourth
grade or something. 2,486.

39:19.830 --> 39:23.633
I won two free movie passes.
I want you guys to go, right now.

39:23.733 --> 39:25.716
Take a break.

39:38.179 --> 39:40.382
I don't like this.

39:40.982 --> 39:43.784
Are you even going to talk to me
about the other day?

39:43.884 --> 39:46.900
No. No, I'm not.

39:50.587 --> 39:54.858
Doug, nice to meet you in person.
Welcome to our humble laboratory.

39:54.958 --> 39:58.624
- This is Jordan.
- Let's cut to the chase.

39:58.724 --> 40:03.264
You made some pretty outrageous claims on
the phone and I don't like my time wasted.

40:03.364 --> 40:07.868
But Jerry vouched for you, so here I am.

40:08.368 --> 40:11.237
- Let's see it.
- Okay. Sure. Of course.

40:11.337 --> 40:14.406
But you can't really just see it.
You need to experience it,

40:14.506 --> 40:17.041
which means we need to...

40:17.141 --> 40:22.861
administer a small injection
into your cerebrospinal fluid.

40:24.180 --> 40:27.116
- Go ahead.
- Sir.

40:27.216 --> 40:29.487
- Is it safe?
- Completely.

40:29.587 --> 40:33.736
- So go ahead, then.
- You're gonna have to take off your shirt.

41:18.761 --> 41:21.913
Do you want to see
what we've been working on?

42:26.961 --> 42:30.598
So we're actually going to be able
to talk to each other with our minds?

42:30.698 --> 42:35.235
Not exactly. If we both listen to each
other's thoughts at the same time,

42:35.335 --> 42:38.771
it could create a circular feedback loop.

42:38.871 --> 42:40.139
Meaning?

42:40.239 --> 42:44.443
Meaning if I was listening to your thoughts
listening to my thoughts

42:44.543 --> 42:48.947
listening to your thoughts
and on and on and on and on,

42:49.047 --> 42:51.516
then it could create a resonance,

42:51.616 --> 42:54.675
like when you hold a microphone
too close to a speaker.

42:59.322 --> 43:02.225
So I'm just gonna hear your thoughts then.

43:02.325 --> 43:04.661
Right. You ready?

43:04.761 --> 43:06.777
I guess.

43:17.438 --> 43:20.007
I love you so much, baby.

43:20.407 --> 43:22.909
Everything I do is for you and Lana.

43:23.009 --> 43:25.978
This should fix things.
We should have done this sooner.

43:26.078 --> 43:28.046
I shouldn't have scared her
with the feedback loop.

43:28.146 --> 43:30.448
Everything I do is for you and Lana.

43:30.548 --> 43:33.651
What was I thinking? I hope you know that.

43:33.751 --> 43:36.020
Hopefully she doesn't see
anything about Jordan.

43:36.520 --> 43:40.222
This is going to change the world.
Everything is going to be okay now.

43:40.322 --> 43:42.038
Don't think about Jordan.

43:43.490 --> 43:46.668
- How was it?
- Get it off. Get it off. Get it off.

43:46.768 --> 43:50.263
Okay, okay, okay, there. It's off.

43:50.363 --> 43:52.579
What happened?

43:55.300 --> 43:58.703
- What did you do?
- What do you mean? What happened?

43:58.803 --> 44:02.205
- I saw her. I saw Jordan!
- Saw who? Saw what? Tell me!

44:02.305 --> 44:05.474
- You had sex with her.
- That... that is not true.

44:05.574 --> 44:09.811
Don't lie to me.
You can't lie to me. I saw it!

44:09.911 --> 44:11.560
- God, I saw it in your head.
- Mel.

44:11.660 --> 44:15.514
My God. I kept telling myself that I was
crazy, that it was... it was nothing...

44:15.614 --> 44:18.243
- Melanie, it wasn't real.
- It was real. I felt it.

44:18.343 --> 44:21.685
You probably felt a lot of things. 30 thoughts
a second are flying into your mind.

44:21.785 --> 44:24.412
Anything that pops into my consciousness,
no matter how fleeting,

44:24.512 --> 44:29.938
- you feel it, as if it was real.
- Just stop it! Stop it.

44:33.059 --> 44:36.563
This whole time I thought
that our biggest issue

44:36.663 --> 44:41.834
- was your prima donna bullshit, and now...
- I have never done anything with her.

44:42.634 --> 44:44.483
Never.

44:46.303 --> 44:48.509
I've just...

44:48.938 --> 44:51.498
I've just thought about it.

44:53.075 --> 44:57.356
No. I don't believe you.

45:36.147 --> 45:39.298
Ryan, David,
you mind staying for a moment?

45:40.584 --> 45:45.255
You know, a half dozen computers have up
and vanished in the last couple of years.

45:45.355 --> 45:50.181
Couple of weeks ago,
half a fluoroscopy table went missing.

45:53.628 --> 45:56.465
And then last night,
at one of the galas that we host,

45:56.565 --> 45:59.000
I got to talking
to an entertaining young fellow,

45:59.100 --> 46:03.937
and he told me a story about an invention
that's going to change everything,

46:04.337 --> 46:07.673
about unauthorized experimentation,

46:07.773 --> 46:12.590
and seriously dangerous,
extremely unethical human testing.

46:13.842 --> 46:16.226
You're both expelled.

46:24.784 --> 46:27.087
What just happened?

46:27.487 --> 46:31.098
I don't know, man.
We better clear out your garage.

46:31.198 --> 46:35.827
Ryan, come on. Who was he talking about?
How did he know?

46:35.927 --> 46:38.029
I don't know. We got blitzed.

46:38.129 --> 46:41.712
- Your AC's busted.
- How did he know?

46:45.034 --> 46:47.837
Look, you're obsessed with testing,
so while you were gone the other night,

46:47.937 --> 46:52.121
I had this VC guy come over,
and I pitched him the project.

46:52.606 --> 46:56.209
- You did what?
- I needed the cash. I'm sorry.

46:56.309 --> 47:00.060
- You needed the cash.
- Yes, I needed the cash.

47:08.085 --> 47:10.642
Oh, shit.

47:19.495 --> 47:23.602
Please wait there, sir. I said stop!

47:24.732 --> 47:27.336
- David, what is going on?
- David Thorogood?

47:27.436 --> 47:30.735
- Are you okay?
- You stole everything?

47:30.835 --> 47:32.971
Stop, now!

47:33.071 --> 47:35.920
Ryan. Ryan Cates.

47:36.606 --> 47:38.256
Fuck.

47:39.075 --> 47:40.925
Wait.

47:42.394 --> 47:46.595
- How about this one?
- You want to read me the serial number?

47:47.648 --> 47:49.951
- You can't take those.
- You'd be mistaken about that.

47:50.051 --> 47:52.890
No, I mean what's on those computers.
I own what's on those computers.

47:52.990 --> 47:55.322
David Thorogood...

47:55.422 --> 47:57.404
you're under arrest.

48:09.334 --> 48:11.804
- Look, I'm sorry.
- No.

48:11.904 --> 48:15.908
Stop, I don't want to hear another word
coming out of your mouth.

48:16.308 --> 48:18.157
Fine.

48:18.976 --> 48:24.095
I'm getting evicted,
and you cashed in behind my back?

48:28.484 --> 48:31.634
I know you were stealing food
out of my fridge.

48:33.187 --> 48:35.290
Who does that?

48:35.390 --> 48:37.973
Who steals groceries?

48:41.477 --> 48:45.729
Bail's been posted, lover boys.
You're free to go.

48:59.110 --> 49:01.160
Grams died.

49:05.815 --> 49:08.733
I couldn't even afford a casket.

49:17.793 --> 49:19.728
Hey, boys.

49:19.828 --> 49:21.829
Let's go.

49:21.929 --> 49:24.245
Ryan, wait.

49:26.332 --> 49:28.883
Ryan, come on.

49:43.047 --> 49:44.897
Hello?

50:10.674 --> 50:15.026
- David.
- Hi, Sharon. How are you?

50:17.913 --> 50:19.982
Is Melanie here?

50:20.082 --> 50:24.251
No, she did say that she
didn't want to see you.

50:24.351 --> 50:26.587
Hey, kiddo!

50:26.687 --> 50:29.770
Get back inside, Lana.

50:37.278 --> 50:39.729
It's okay, Mom.

50:56.846 --> 51:00.696
- What did you tell Lana?
- Nothing.

51:01.502 --> 51:07.107
Her volcano didn't explode
at the science fair, so she's pretty upset.

51:07.357 --> 51:10.407
- I'm sorry.
- Don't tell me.

51:14.195 --> 51:16.398
So what, they let you out already?

51:16.498 --> 51:20.101
- We posted bail.
- How'd that happen?

51:20.201 --> 51:23.484
Jordan had some savings, I guess.

51:23.969 --> 51:25.625
Of course.

51:26.605 --> 51:28.455
Mel...

51:29.340 --> 51:30.842
I really need you right now.

51:30.942 --> 51:34.579
No, it looks like she's
taking care of you just fine.

51:34.679 --> 51:38.196
- You know that's not true.
- No, I don't, actually.

51:41.934 --> 51:44.838
We get officially evicted tomorrow.

51:44.938 --> 51:46.787
Yup.

51:48.757 --> 51:50.560
Look...

51:51.360 --> 51:55.797
I think it's time that we just stop
forcing this, just face the truth.

51:55.897 --> 52:00.467
And we both know
that if it wasn't for Lana,

52:00.567 --> 52:05.777
we would have never gotten married,
and I just think that...

52:07.238 --> 52:10.309
We should just stop
torturing ourselves and just move on.

52:10.409 --> 52:15.379
- For you, our marriage has just been torture?
- Come on. You know what I mean.

52:15.479 --> 52:17.931
You cannot tell me that you've
actually enjoyed the last few years.

52:18.031 --> 52:21.917
- I have enjoyed every moment together.
- Oh, my God.

52:22.017 --> 52:26.554
I can't do this! I can't have you here.
I can't have you come here tomorrow.

52:26.654 --> 52:28.489
I just... I need some time, okay?

52:28.589 --> 52:31.825
So can you... I don't know,
can you stay with Ryan or something?

52:31.925 --> 52:34.828
Yeah, sure. Whatever you need.

52:34.928 --> 52:37.030
I just need to know we're gonna be okay.

52:37.130 --> 52:41.033
No, we're not!
You can't have it both ways.

52:41.133 --> 52:46.504
You can't spend all of your time
working on your crazy experiments

52:46.604 --> 52:50.740
and expect your marriage to work too.
You have to sacrifice something.

52:50.840 --> 52:52.889
I know.

52:53.675 --> 52:57.359
So what is more important?

52:58.812 --> 53:01.296
Changing the world...

53:02.415 --> 53:04.865
or changing us?

53:14.826 --> 53:17.194
What's going on?

53:17.294 --> 53:19.544
Oh, man.

53:20.162 --> 53:23.599
- What are you doing?
- Just taking what's mine.

53:23.699 --> 53:26.735
- This stuff is both of ours.
- No.

53:26.835 --> 53:30.738
The computers and programming supplies,
those were yours.

53:30.838 --> 53:32.840
The head patches, those are mine.

53:32.940 --> 53:35.609
The nanotubes and med supplies,
those are Jordan's.

53:35.709 --> 53:39.179
- Why didn't you tell me about your grandma?
- You know what the best part about it is?

53:39.279 --> 53:43.583
Now that we're bypassing your BCI
and connecting brain to brain directly,

53:43.683 --> 53:46.631
- we don't even need a programmer anymore!
- Ryan, don't do this.

53:46.731 --> 53:49.893
- Yeah, come on, this is stupid.
- You stay out of it!

53:55.960 --> 54:01.365
Look, I get it, okay? You've been abandoned
by every important person in your life.

54:01.465 --> 54:03.934
Death sucks.

54:04.034 --> 54:07.470
Your dad's an idiot. It's why you cut ties
with anyone before they can hurt you.

54:07.570 --> 54:10.825
It's why you go through girls so fast,
it's why you got an investor behind my back,

54:10.925 --> 54:13.013
- and it's why you're leaving.
- You think that reading my thoughts...

54:13.113 --> 54:16.075
No, it's because you're my friend.
That's how I know.

54:16.175 --> 54:20.067
I'm not going anywhere, okay?
I'm not gonna die,

54:20.167 --> 54:24.260
leave, or secretly betray you
somehow, I promise.

54:25.347 --> 54:27.150
Just...

54:27.650 --> 54:29.699
Just stay.

54:32.319 --> 54:35.703
Ryan! Please.

54:36.188 --> 54:39.240
Are you driving, or am I walking?

54:46.297 --> 54:49.448
- I'm sorry.
- Just drive, okay?

55:18.260 --> 55:21.743
Package one is in the red sedan
on Lunada Place.

55:43.248 --> 55:45.531
You're back.

55:46.384 --> 55:48.734
Couldn't do it.

55:51.721 --> 55:54.472
Wasn't right, what he did to you.

55:59.361 --> 56:04.400
Whatever. Doesn't matter,
it's the least of my worries now.

56:04.500 --> 56:06.401
Yeah.

56:06.501 --> 56:08.951
I guess you're right.

56:48.141 --> 56:50.444
Well, I'm sure you boys
got some questions.

56:50.544 --> 56:52.779
- Who are you?
- My name's Harry Matthews,

56:52.879 --> 56:56.514
- Executive Director of Operation DARKBIRD.
- DARKBIRD?

56:56.614 --> 56:59.533
Brain Information
Reconnaissance Directive.

56:59.633 --> 57:02.853
We work out of the Clandestine
Information Technology Office.

57:02.953 --> 57:05.421
Oh, shit.

57:07.421 --> 57:10.024
- You're a spy?
- I'm sorry.

57:10.124 --> 57:12.473
How did you...

57:12.958 --> 57:15.761
- What's her real name?
- Jordan Rose.

57:15.861 --> 57:19.630
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we're pretty sure.

57:19.730 --> 57:22.298
- Where are we?
- KPYL Chemical.

57:22.398 --> 57:26.215
Undercover research facility
in Washington, D.C.

57:27.668 --> 57:30.171
We'd like to offer you boys
employment with the company.

57:30.271 --> 57:33.173
Is kidnapping your usual
recruitment method these days?

57:33.273 --> 57:36.143
Nah. Not usually.

57:36.243 --> 57:41.180
But the ability to read minds is obviously
a matter of urgent national security.

57:41.280 --> 57:43.815
- How did you find us?
- Six months ago.

57:43.915 --> 57:45.283
You hacked into our CITO network,

57:45.383 --> 57:48.652
and you downloaded our most
advanced EEG analysis software.

57:48.752 --> 57:52.155
You thought we didn't notice. We did.

57:52.555 --> 57:54.624
Most of the biggest breakthroughs
happen off the radar.

57:54.724 --> 57:57.759
Can she not talk anymore?
I'd prefer it if she stopped talking.

57:57.959 --> 57:59.927
The company cannot afford
to be behind the curve.

58:00.027 --> 58:04.351
- What, so you sent in spies?
- Yeah, we're the CIA. That's what we do.

58:04.451 --> 58:07.346
We've been funding BCI research
for quite some time, but...

58:07.446 --> 58:10.770
codes of ethics tend to slow down
our government operations.

58:10.870 --> 58:13.539
We strictly avoid any dangerous
human experimentation.

58:13.639 --> 58:15.807
Yeah, but why did you wait
so long to bring us in?

58:15.907 --> 58:17.742
It's hard to capture lightning
in a bottle twice.

58:17.842 --> 58:20.544
We usually just let these projects
go until the well dries up.

58:20.644 --> 58:23.946
But Jordan convinced us that you boys
might be of use to us here at DARKBIRD.

58:24.046 --> 58:26.849
So... here we are.

58:26.949 --> 58:30.251
If it's still an option, I think I'll just
leave. I won't tell anyone what I know.

58:30.551 --> 58:32.538
- My lips are sealed.
- Sit down.

58:32.638 --> 58:36.023
No. I don't care what your pitch is.
I can't work with either of these people.

58:36.123 --> 58:38.591
You can't work with...
you're the one that we can't trust!

58:38.691 --> 58:42.193
- Don't start lecturing me on trust again.
- I don't care what you've been through.

58:42.293 --> 58:44.561
It doesn't give you free license
to be a backstabbing bastard.

58:44.661 --> 58:48.230
Tell me how you really feel. Why don't you
tell me about this software you hacked?

58:48.330 --> 58:51.065
It wouldn't have mattered if you could
stop chasing ass for five seconds.

58:51.165 --> 58:54.699
Okay, stop. It wasn't his fault.
If you want to blame someone, blame me.

58:54.799 --> 58:56.736
I do. Your Bond girl act
ruined my marriage.

58:56.836 --> 59:00.085
Your marriage was shit long
before she came into the picture.

59:00.855 --> 59:02.356
Stop it!

59:03.006 --> 59:06.823
Don't! Stop it! Oh, my God.

59:11.211 --> 59:13.462
Get up.

59:23.788 --> 59:26.024
Here's the offer.

59:26.324 --> 59:29.440
First, I'm gonna clear your name
of all criminal charges.

59:30.259 --> 59:34.130
Second, I'm gonna write down a fair salary
right here on this piece of paper.

59:34.230 --> 59:38.767
Third, you nancies get to continue
your little science fair project

59:38.867 --> 59:41.917
with virtually unlimited resources.

59:51.010 --> 59:53.880
We don't really have a choice, do we?

59:53.980 --> 59:55.829
No.

59:58.649 --> 01:00:01.100
Double the salary.

01:00:14.598 --> 01:00:18.535
The two of you will have a team of
scientists assigned to your departments,

01:00:18.635 --> 01:00:21.204
and you'll report directly to Dr. Selph.

01:00:21.304 --> 01:00:25.314
- Dr. Nicolas Selph?
- The one and only.

01:00:27.341 --> 01:00:29.360
Dr. Selph, hi.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:33.545
I'd like to introduce you to
David Thorogood and Ryan Cates.

01:00:36.048 --> 01:00:37.984
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

01:00:38.084 --> 01:00:40.986
Your paper on the neuromechanics of
thought origination changed my life.

01:00:41.086 --> 01:00:45.223
- It's the reason I'm here today.
- Kiss ass.

01:00:45.723 --> 01:00:49.826
Thank you. We've had a chance to take a
good look at your work on thought decoding.

01:00:49.926 --> 01:00:52.662
And you must be
the brain interface expert.

01:00:52.762 --> 01:00:55.397
We're very impressed
with your work around here also.

01:00:55.497 --> 01:00:57.445
Thank you, sir. You know,

01:00:57.545 --> 01:01:01.135
my head patches really bypass the need
for any thought decoding work.

01:01:01.235 --> 01:01:04.485
Is David even really necessary
on this project?

01:01:56.053 --> 01:01:57.888
Mom?

01:01:57.988 --> 01:02:00.155
Yeah, baby?

01:02:00.255 --> 01:02:02.571
I miss Dad.

01:02:37.189 --> 01:02:40.092
- Hey, Jordan.
- Hey.

01:02:40.392 --> 01:02:41.526
What's this?

01:02:41.626 --> 01:02:44.876
Ryan got wireless working
on the new head patches.

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.747
Crazy.

01:02:53.335 --> 01:02:54.402
You know what's going on?

01:02:54.502 --> 01:02:58.672
I guess someone is coming down hard
on Matthews about security.

01:02:58.772 --> 01:03:01.207
Apparently the DS&T found out
about our breakthrough,

01:03:01.307 --> 01:03:02.975
and they're trying to keep
a tight lid on it.

01:03:03.075 --> 01:03:07.312
Everyone's throwing "national security"
around like a hot potato.

01:03:07.812 --> 01:03:12.516
- So what are they doing?
- It's Matthews' solution.

01:03:12.616 --> 01:03:14.451
It's kind of obvious, actually.

01:03:14.551 --> 01:03:17.086
Every scientist working on
this project from here on out

01:03:17.186 --> 01:03:20.722
is going to get a dedicated Listener,
making sure there are no spies in the room.

01:03:20.822 --> 01:03:24.439
They're turning
our own technology against us.

01:03:45.678 --> 01:03:48.561
The experiment's results
show that prolonged...

01:04:02.159 --> 01:04:04.842
Two-way connection
carries a severe risk...

01:04:11.401 --> 01:04:14.037
Recognize patterns in the code.

01:04:14.137 --> 01:04:16.506
See, the subject might think...

01:04:16.606 --> 01:04:18.541
might think "shoot," right?

01:04:18.641 --> 01:04:23.378
But is he thinking about a gun,
a camera, a basketball...

01:04:23.478 --> 01:04:26.447
<i>How am I supposed to work with that Listener
hearing every thought going through my head?</i>

01:04:26.547 --> 01:04:28.649
- <i>This is insane. This isn't right</i>.
- Right. Got it.

01:04:28.749 --> 01:04:31.099
<i>We are all being violated.</i>

01:04:36.722 --> 01:04:38.458
Yeah.

01:04:38.558 --> 01:04:41.193
- He was thinking about a gun.
- Oh. Sorry, sir.

01:04:41.293 --> 01:04:44.310
That's all right. It's not easy.

01:04:53.203 --> 01:04:56.686
- David, how are you?
- I'm all right.

01:04:57.539 --> 01:05:03.310
Still weirded out by the Red Room and all
the Listeners keeping watch all the time.

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:07.214
- It's creepy.
- It's quite scary, where all this is headed.

01:05:07.514 --> 01:05:10.317
Can't believe they've got you
under surveillance.

01:05:10.417 --> 01:05:14.454
What did you mean, sir?
It's scary where all this is headed?

01:05:14.554 --> 01:05:16.422
Damn that Ryan.

01:05:16.522 --> 01:05:20.654
Spends more time groping my scientists
than doing any real work.

01:05:51.853 --> 01:05:55.324
- How did you do it?
- I don't like this.

01:05:55.424 --> 01:05:57.975
We were plugged into your brain
every day and never had any idea

01:05:58.075 --> 01:06:02.295
- that you were even thinking something else.
- I'm not actually a nymphomaniac, okay?

01:06:02.595 --> 01:06:05.747
- It's as simple as that.
- I have to see that file.

01:06:05.847 --> 01:06:09.217
Plus, thinking one thing
and actively doing another?

01:06:09.317 --> 01:06:13.204
You're talking about forcing metacognition
in a different part of the brain,

01:06:13.304 --> 01:06:15.573
and you know that's impossible.

01:06:15.673 --> 01:06:19.709
Buddhist monks can do it. They can
consciously control their blood pressure,

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:22.345
change their body temperature
just by meditating.

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:26.604
I can't afford suspicious thoughts
creeping into my head at work.

01:06:33.754 --> 01:06:36.291
Do you think Ryan will ever forgive me?

01:06:36.391 --> 01:06:39.273
I've never seen him let go of a grudge.

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.430
But if he was to forgive anybody...

01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:46.879
it'd probably be you.

01:07:09.050 --> 01:07:11.520
I love blueberries.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:16.358
They taste so delicious.
They're full of anthocyanins.

01:07:16.558 --> 01:07:20.762
They taste like blue spectacularness.

01:07:20.862 --> 01:07:24.132
They're really good in muffins, pancakes.

01:07:24.232 --> 01:07:28.102
Blueberries in scones.
You can put 'em in your...

01:07:28.202 --> 01:07:30.351
Blueberries?

01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:32.206
- Really?
- I was just...

01:07:32.306 --> 01:07:35.222
It's better if you don't make an excuse.

01:08:09.739 --> 01:08:11.642
Really?

01:08:11.742 --> 01:08:14.110
There's a life-or-death emergency
at the Lincoln Memorial?

01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:18.345
If they're reading our thoughts at work, it's a
sure bet they're bugging our apartments too.

01:08:18.446 --> 01:08:21.682
Don't say anything you don't want
my Listener to hear later.

01:08:22.082 --> 01:08:24.618
I stole this file from work.

01:08:24.718 --> 01:08:28.787
- Okay, I'm leaving.
- They launched a new operation.

01:08:28.888 --> 01:08:31.812
They've got a plan for every kid
in America to get a nanotube injection

01:08:31.912 --> 01:08:35.142
just like any other vaccine
before they start grade school.

01:08:35.242 --> 01:08:37.475
That's great.
Everyone's gonna need injections.

01:08:37.576 --> 01:08:40.261
Soon enough, anything electronic
is gonna have a brain user interface.

01:08:40.361 --> 01:08:42.929
- That's not the real motive!
- Then how about locked-in patients?

01:08:43.029 --> 01:08:45.096
Laryngeal cancer? Children with autism?

01:08:45.197 --> 01:08:48.066
15 million Americans have some
kind of communication disorder,

01:08:48.166 --> 01:08:52.002
and we're going to put an end to all of that.
We've already done it. The bomb's gone off.

01:08:52.102 --> 01:08:53.803
Come on, man, you've seen
how it is at work.

01:08:53.903 --> 01:08:56.037
Every contradicting thought
has become a crime.

01:08:56.138 --> 01:08:58.573
The whole world is gonna be like that.

01:08:58.673 --> 01:09:01.642
- The Red Room was my idea.
- What?

01:09:01.742 --> 01:09:05.812
They didn't un-invent the cell phone just
because the FBI could listen in on your calls.

01:09:06.312 --> 01:09:09.615
Do you know why they've got my team
decoding the entirety of human thought?

01:09:09.715 --> 01:09:12.765
Yeah, so I can tweet without a keyboard.

01:09:13.584 --> 01:09:18.455
Implanting. That's the endgame.
The power to implant thoughts.

01:09:18.555 --> 01:09:22.675
Into a person, a group,
an entire population.

01:09:22.774 --> 01:09:24.943
They'll sell it to the world
as the power to communicate,

01:09:25.042 --> 01:09:27.011
and then they'll have
complete power to control.

01:09:27.111 --> 01:09:30.330
The CIA won't need to stage a coup
to rig an election across the planet.

01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:33.832
They could turn any one of us into an
undercover assassin whenever they wanted,

01:09:33.933 --> 01:09:37.803
and they would do it all from
a computer in a lab, right here.

01:09:37.903 --> 01:09:40.906
Matthews lied. They've been
testing on humans for months.

01:09:41.006 --> 01:09:44.542
They were stuck,
and we just unlocked it all for them.

01:09:44.642 --> 01:09:47.911
This is a cure for war. Do you realize
how many lives this will save?

01:09:48.011 --> 01:09:49.279
It's too much power.

01:09:49.379 --> 01:09:53.082
This work, everything that we're doing...
this is the end of freedom.

01:09:53.183 --> 01:09:57.534
No, it's not. It's the birth of freedom.

01:10:14.934 --> 01:10:16.485
Go ahead.

01:11:31.573 --> 01:11:33.389
Hello?

01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:45.685
His phone.

01:11:45.785 --> 01:11:47.920
It's in his apartment,
but he's not answering.

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:49.688
- Check his car.
- It's on the move.

01:11:49.788 --> 01:11:53.171
- Where to?
- Not here.

01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:57.905
- Why isn't he here?
- Who?

01:11:58.005 --> 01:11:59.522
- Santa Claus!
- Don't ask me.

01:11:59.622 --> 01:12:01.808
- He's your best friend.
- Not anymore.

01:12:01.908 --> 01:12:04.733
- What'd you say to him?
- Hey, the boy's a couple of minutes late.

01:12:04.833 --> 01:12:07.051
- Cut him some slack.
- I want you to go find him.

01:12:07.151 --> 01:12:10.668
He's not my responsibility.
Send a field agent.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.083
- He's headed to the airport.
- I'll go.

01:12:17.183 --> 01:12:21.394
Not alone, you're not.
We're bringing the cavalry.

01:12:28.619 --> 01:12:30.655
Daddy!

01:12:32.156 --> 01:12:34.124
You're heavy!

01:12:34.224 --> 01:12:36.259
No more growing up without me.

01:12:36.359 --> 01:12:37.848
Hi.

01:12:41.196 --> 01:12:43.865
- Where'd the car come from?
- It's a company car.

01:12:43.965 --> 01:12:45.900
- We need to talk.
- I know, but not with Lana.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.768
We can't talk at home either.

01:12:48.368 --> 01:12:50.570
I looked up the venture capitalist
that Ryan talked to.

01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:55.921
He died in a car accident the same night
we were kidnapped. His assistant too.

01:12:56.507 --> 01:13:00.011
I can't go back to work, no matter what
happens. If they knew what I wanted to do.

01:13:00.111 --> 01:13:03.280
- What is it that you want to do?
- I have to stop it, just end it all somehow.

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:04.414
- Dave!
- What?

01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:08.080
- It's the CIA! What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:12.350
- Find a recipe in <i>The Anarchist...</i>
- Daddy, watch me!

01:13:19.024 --> 01:13:22.828
Look... I'm sorry. I really am.
I'm sorry you're so stressed.

01:13:22.928 --> 01:13:26.478
I am not just stressed out, okay?

01:13:30.534 --> 01:13:33.818
Look, I didn't come out here
to work this out.

01:13:37.090 --> 01:13:40.008
I came here to get a divorce.

01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:13.229
Mommy?

01:14:13.879 --> 01:14:15.949
It's okay, baby.

01:14:24.283 --> 01:14:26.269
- You're late for work.
- So you're gonna shoot me?

01:14:26.369 --> 01:14:29.819
- We didn't know where you were.
- So you come with all this?

01:14:31.656 --> 01:14:33.992
- Daddy?
- It's okay, baby.

01:14:34.092 --> 01:14:36.242
They're not gonna hurt you.

01:14:39.262 --> 01:14:42.613
Looks like this was
just a miscommunication, sir.

01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:48.203
I think David forgot
to call in a sick day.

01:14:48.303 --> 01:14:52.052
You haven't used all your sick days
yet, have you, David?

01:14:52.771 --> 01:14:54.173
No.

01:14:54.273 --> 01:14:58.076
Well, good thing you're a government
employee and not a prison inmate,

01:14:58.176 --> 01:15:01.457
because government employees
get sick days.

01:15:21.331 --> 01:15:24.233
Look, I need you to know that David
never laid a finger on me.

01:15:24.333 --> 01:15:26.668
- You wanted me to leave him.
- You were expendable at the time.

01:15:26.768 --> 01:15:29.517
I was trying to save your life.

01:15:29.935 --> 01:15:33.820
He's a good man. Be there for him.

01:15:42.629 --> 01:15:44.679
Cool!

01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:07.252
This is actually really nice.

01:16:07.352 --> 01:16:09.937
You've been getting the money
I've been sending, right?

01:16:10.037 --> 01:16:11.905
Yes.

01:16:12.205 --> 01:16:14.488
Thank you for that.

01:16:19.411 --> 01:16:22.294
- Hey, Dave?
- Yeah?

01:16:26.284 --> 01:16:30.802
Look, maybe I started too soon
with all this divorce stuff.

01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:35.288
- Can you turn that down?
- No.

01:16:35.388 --> 01:16:37.566
- Why not?
- They can hear us.

01:16:37.666 --> 01:16:39.475
Who?

01:16:41.796 --> 01:16:44.423
I need to get out of here, now.

01:16:44.523 --> 01:16:48.081
Can we maybe just talk
for a second first, please?

01:16:49.568 --> 01:16:50.884
Dave!

01:16:52.604 --> 01:16:54.472
Dave!

01:16:54.572 --> 01:16:57.288
Call Matthews. I'm going up.

01:17:00.677 --> 01:17:03.112
You and Lana need to get as
far away from me as possible.

01:17:03.212 --> 01:17:04.213
Where are you gonna go?

01:17:04.313 --> 01:17:06.281
I think I have a plan,
but it's better if you don't know.

01:17:06.381 --> 01:17:09.349
Daddy, it's loud!

01:17:09.449 --> 01:17:13.219
I love you more than anything in the
entire world. Don't forget that, okay?

01:17:13.419 --> 01:17:16.236
I can't hear you!

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:32.883
I should've taken you on that date.

01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:36.786
I know.

01:17:51.685 --> 01:17:52.935
Where is he?

01:19:24.503 --> 01:19:27.086
Close your eyes.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.424
Breathe deeply.

01:19:34.745 --> 01:19:36.628
Clear your mind.

01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:46.237
With each breath, your troubles leave you.

01:19:48.792 --> 01:19:51.241
Your worries leave you.

01:19:54.028 --> 01:19:57.079
Let go of your thoughts.

01:20:00.734 --> 01:20:03.485
Let go of your body.

01:20:04.304 --> 01:20:07.055
Feel only your heart.

01:20:08.641 --> 01:20:11.411
Your mind is clear.

01:20:11.511 --> 01:20:14.414
There is only your heart.

01:20:15.014 --> 01:20:19.017
Beating... and beating...

01:20:19.117 --> 01:20:21.023
and beating.

01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:24.039
And now...

01:20:24.489 --> 01:20:27.339
let go of your heart.

01:20:42.573 --> 01:20:45.442
- What happened?
- You fainted.

01:20:45.742 --> 01:20:48.424
It's a good sign.

01:21:59.542 --> 01:22:04.294
The right action for the wrong reason
is still wrong.

01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:08.084
The wrong action for the right reason

01:22:08.184 --> 01:22:10.734
is no more right.

01:22:16.257 --> 01:22:19.995
You know that place
between thinking about something...

01:22:20.095 --> 01:22:22.644
and actually doing it?

01:22:23.497 --> 01:22:25.366
I've been there.

01:22:25.466 --> 01:22:28.316
It's where free will happens, and...

01:22:28.701 --> 01:22:31.285
it's in danger.

01:22:33.505 --> 01:22:36.108
If you go now...

01:22:36.208 --> 01:22:39.859
you will lose all that you have gained.

01:22:45.465 --> 01:22:48.188
Then such is my sacrifice.

01:23:04.163 --> 01:23:05.898
Holy shit.

01:23:05.998 --> 01:23:08.065
Not quite.

01:23:08.165 --> 01:23:10.781
Just semi-holy.

01:23:20.543 --> 01:23:23.426
You look ridiculous with my haircut.

01:23:25.147 --> 01:23:27.464
How's Jordan?

01:23:33.621 --> 01:23:37.259
I've been carrying this around
for two weeks now,

01:23:37.359 --> 01:23:40.109
just waiting for the timing to be right.

01:23:52.305 --> 01:23:55.422
It's a little soon, don't you think?

01:23:56.942 --> 01:23:59.860
A lot's changed since you've been gone.

01:24:01.713 --> 01:24:05.284
I'm the head of the lab now,
just under Dr. Selph.

01:24:05.384 --> 01:24:09.254
And me and Jordan, we're happy.

01:24:09.354 --> 01:24:14.205
We're really happy, so now I gotta be
willing to step up to the plate, right?

01:24:14.657 --> 01:24:17.875
That's great, man.
I'm really happy for you.

01:24:18.727 --> 01:24:22.797
- So you gonna tell me why you're here?
- I want to go back to work.

01:24:23.497 --> 01:24:28.068
Good luck with that! It was chaos
when you disappeared, a full-on manhunt.

01:24:28.168 --> 01:24:31.037
They planted stories in the news, saying
you'd done all sorts of horrible things,

01:24:31.137 --> 01:24:35.273
trying to get people to turn you in.
Forget about coming back. They hate you.

01:24:35.373 --> 01:24:38.162
They're going to throw you in jail.
Or worse.

01:24:38.442 --> 01:24:40.644
There has to be a way.

01:24:40.744 --> 01:24:42.959
This is all I'm good at.
There's nothing else for me.

01:24:43.059 --> 01:24:46.246
It has been slow as hell since you left.

01:24:46.964 --> 01:24:49.300
I mean, we could definitely use you,

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:53.169
but I think they're just as likely
to shoot you on sight as to talk to you.

01:24:53.269 --> 01:24:55.685
I'll take my chances.

01:24:56.337 --> 01:24:57.420
Yeah.

01:25:09.749 --> 01:25:13.431
Hello, David. Long time.

01:25:14.954 --> 01:25:19.106
- Well, at least they didn't shoot you.
- Not yet.

01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:23.502
I took a bus to New York.

01:25:23.762 --> 01:25:27.432
Hacked into a couple
college student databases,

01:25:27.532 --> 01:25:29.700
ran them through
facial recognition software

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.470
until I found a kid at NYU
that was a pretty close match.

01:25:33.570 --> 01:25:37.140
I gave him 10 grand for his passport,
no questions asked.

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.842
Since then, I've been living
in a Buddhist temple,

01:25:39.942 --> 01:25:42.845
trying to find a new reason to live.

01:25:42.945 --> 01:25:45.627
All over a broad?

01:25:45.946 --> 01:25:48.182
I never took you for the romantic type.

01:25:48.282 --> 01:25:52.653
You never know what type you are until
you lose the thing most important to you.

01:25:53.253 --> 01:25:54.934
We need him.

01:25:55.034 --> 01:25:57.823
- He's the best BCI programmer on the planet.
- I don't trust him.

01:25:57.923 --> 01:26:00.643
We'll be listening to every thought
that goes through his head.

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:11.192
David!

01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:15.539
David! Can't believe you're back!

01:27:18.696 --> 01:27:22.631
- He asked you.
- Yeah. Isn't it amazing?

01:27:26.036 --> 01:27:28.253
Congratulations.

01:27:35.478 --> 01:27:36.712
What's he thinking?

01:27:36.812 --> 01:27:39.102
I think there's something wrong
with my head link, sir.

01:27:49.021 --> 01:27:50.257
What's happening?

01:27:50.357 --> 01:27:53.740
There's almost no activity.
This can't be right.

01:27:57.228 --> 01:28:00.265
Connection looks good.
Everything should be working.

01:28:00.365 --> 01:28:03.748
Get out of the way. Get out!

01:28:21.381 --> 01:28:23.852
There's this background noise
that sounds almost like a heartbeat,

01:28:23.952 --> 01:28:29.269
- but all he seems to be thinking is...
- "Breathe in and breathe out."

01:28:53.744 --> 01:28:57.195
Jordan! Your head patch! No!

01:30:06.315 --> 01:30:08.151
This?

01:30:08.251 --> 01:30:10.601
This is why you came back?

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:14.152
I had to do it.

01:30:14.252 --> 01:30:16.836
There's no other way.

01:30:26.751 --> 01:30:30.221
Ryan... listen to me.

01:30:30.671 --> 01:30:33.093
The information in our brains,
it's too dangerous.

01:30:33.198 --> 01:30:35.747
Open up a head link.

01:30:47.242 --> 01:30:49.792
A one-way connection.

01:30:50.344 --> 01:30:53.495
I want you to know what I'm feeling.

01:31:03.989 --> 01:31:06.539
How could you do this to me?

01:31:08.926 --> 01:31:11.464
It's okay if you kill me.

01:31:12.764 --> 01:31:16.413
It's the knowledge in both
of our heads that has to die.

01:31:17.466 --> 01:31:20.105
You've taken everything from me.

01:31:23.204 --> 01:31:26.855
I said you've taken everything from me!

01:31:28.341 --> 01:31:31.492
- She's not dead.
- She might as well be.

01:31:31.911 --> 01:31:36.363
You really thought you could undo
all of it, just like that?

01:31:36.815 --> 01:31:39.451
We never meant to create a weapon.

01:31:39.551 --> 01:31:42.087
You're the one using it as a weapon!

01:31:42.187 --> 01:31:44.723
This was your big plan?

01:31:44.823 --> 01:31:47.358
Come in here and nuke all our brains?

01:31:47.458 --> 01:31:51.928
Look at them.
What are you gonna tell his parents?

01:31:52.028 --> 01:31:55.264
"Sorry, your brilliant son
is a vegetable now,

01:31:55.364 --> 01:31:57.967
but don't worry,
it was for the greater good"?

01:31:58.267 --> 01:32:00.816
Is this the greater good?

01:32:01.869 --> 01:32:04.953
Enter the command for a feedback loop.

01:32:08.041 --> 01:32:10.410
Don't hit Enter.

01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:16.030
Back away.

01:32:22.187 --> 01:32:24.280
You want to erase my brain?

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:28.437
Well, I want to blow yours out.

01:32:35.932 --> 01:32:39.209
Draw on the count of three.

01:32:41.152 --> 01:32:43.202
Freeze!

01:32:43.688 --> 01:32:45.238
Put the gun down!

01:32:53.247 --> 01:32:55.503
Well, here it is, Dave.

01:32:55.983 --> 01:32:57.618
- Brains versus brawn.
- Don't do this.

01:32:57.718 --> 01:33:00.534
Put the gun down now, or we'll shoot!

01:33:03.722 --> 01:33:05.558
One...

01:33:06.558 --> 01:33:07.760
two...

01:33:08.710 --> 01:33:10.479
three!
