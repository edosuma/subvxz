{\an1}Yech!

01:06.483 --> 01:08.443
{\an1}Carl!

01:08.526 --> 01:10.820
Sorry, but I can't be
held responsible

01:10.904 --> 01:12.572
for any bad luck today.

01:12.655 --> 01:13.782
What's today?

01:13.865 --> 01:15.617
{\an8}Duh! Friday,
the 13th--

01:15.700 --> 01:17.160
{\an8}my favorite
holiday.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.037
What rock do
you live under?

01:19.120 --> 01:20.330
{\an8}The same rock as my brother,

01:20.413 --> 01:23.917
{\an8}who can't keep from
making a mess on any day.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.710
My first day off in ten days

01:25.794 --> 01:27.670
and I got to hang around
for the plumber.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.423
I've heard of a clogged drain,
but a faucet?

01:30.507 --> 01:32.008
{\an1}Does this mean
no shower tonight?

01:32.091 --> 01:34.177
{\an8}If the plumber
can't fix the problem,

01:34.260 --> 01:36.221
{\an8}it'll be sponge
baths all around.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.723
Okay, let me have them.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.016
I got to get you kids
to school and fly back.

01:40.099 --> 01:43.937
They charge
whether you're home or not.

(<i> engine rumbles,</i>

01:51.778 --> 01:54.197
{\an1}CARL:
Sponge baths.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.657
I don't call that bad luck.

01:55.740 --> 01:58.701
I see now that I'm going to have
to do everything within my power

01:58.785 --> 02:00.703
to tempt the fates.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.997
What's so great
about bad luck?

02:03.081 --> 02:06.334
What's great about it is
that it can lead to good luck,

02:06.417 --> 02:08.669
like last year
when Gordo slipped

02:08.752 --> 02:10.880
on a burrito and broke a femur.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.715
You call that lucky?

02:12.799 --> 02:13.967
Think about it.

02:14.050 --> 02:15.176
She had all those cool
steel pins put in.

02:15.260 --> 02:19.722
Now she can set off metal
detectors totally naked.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.058
That's not just luck,
my friend,

02:22.141 --> 02:24.936
it's performance art
in some circles.

02:25.019 --> 02:27.522
Is it supposed to make
that noise?

02:27.605 --> 02:29.941
When it doesn't,
I know I should worry.

02:30.024 --> 02:33.111
(<i> engine backfiring</i> )

02:33.194 --> 02:36.531
{\an5}Hey, do you think
it'll explode
all at once

02:36.614 --> 02:39.117
or be slowly
devoured in flames?

02:39.200 --> 02:39.742
Don't be ridiculous...

02:39.826 --> 02:41.911
(<i> all scream</i> )

LOIS:
Everybody out, now!!

02:42.954 --> 02:46.291

02:46.374 --> 02:48.167
Ah, great!

02:50.420 --> 02:54.549
{\an5}CARL:
Talk about your
reverse bad luck.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.308
How rude.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.434
Why don't they stop?

03:04.517 --> 03:07.061
Maybe because you're
a four-foot-tall flasher

03:07.145 --> 03:08.146
in a hockey mask.

03:08.229 --> 03:09.772
Well, I hope you're happy.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.608
You finally got your bad luck.

03:11.691 --> 03:15.945
{\an1}I plan on doing
a lot better than this.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.619
Well,<i> quelle surprise!</i>

03:22.702 --> 03:27.123
{\an5}MOTHER:
Oh, dear-- have you called
traveler's aid?

03:27.206 --> 03:29.292
I'd say it's a must.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.960
Why, that auto is ancient.

03:31.044 --> 03:35.173
{\an1}Good... or should I say
"bad" morning, ladies and gents.

03:35.256 --> 03:36.466
Unfortunately Mama
is <i> sans</i> cellular

03:36.549 --> 03:40.887
and me without my walkie-talkie
as bad luck would have it.

03:40.970 --> 03:44.057
No cell phone?
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

03:44.140 --> 03:44.974
A 21st-century requirement.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.311
{\an1}Winston, would you
do the honors.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.271
With pleasure, Miss.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.189
Ginger!

03:51.272 --> 03:53.566
{\an1}This means we can
drive you to school.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.233
{\an1}And, uh,
perhaps Winston

03:54.317 --> 03:55.318
can mend your
shirt for you.

03:55.401 --> 03:59.322
{\an5}BRANDON:
He's quite handy
with a needle and thread.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.740
Uh, no, no, that's okay.

04:00.823 --> 04:04.744
It's just a little tear.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.294
MAN:
Need help there, Ma'am?

04:16.589 --> 04:20.093
Hey, you're the
plumber I called.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.555
You're Mrs. Foutley?

04:24.639 --> 04:27.558
{\an1}Well...
actually it's Miss.

04:27.642 --> 04:30.687
Can I do the honors
and call you a tow truck?

04:30.770 --> 04:32.605
Already got one coming,

04:32.689 --> 04:35.400
{\an1}but, uh... I could
use a ride home.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.069
Well, I could
give you one.

04:38.152 --> 04:41.447
(<i> both laughing</i> )

04:41.531 --> 04:46.703
And that little puppy,
as you so amusingly call it,

04:46.786 --> 04:49.038
is for steaming cappuccinos.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.415
But confidentially,

04:50.498 --> 04:51.958
{\an5}it is also
quite effective
on hot chocolate.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.876
Or loogies, I'm guessing.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.629
{\an1}COURTNEY:
Espresso, Mama?

04:56.713 --> 04:58.965
That would be lovely.

04:59.048 --> 05:00.967
{\an1}Ginger,
can I tempt you?

05:01.050 --> 05:02.218
Uh, no thanks.

05:02.301 --> 05:02.885
Had mine already.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.722
Of course, silly me.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.723
I'll pass.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.933
Caffeine
makes me moody.

05:10.935 --> 05:11.310
Whoa!

05:11.394 --> 05:13.062
Here you are, Mama.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.272
Lovely, dear.

05:14.355 --> 05:15.982
{\an1}Thank you
so much.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.233
You're welcome.

05:17.316 --> 05:17.942
Ohhh!

05:18.026 --> 05:21.654
Carl, that was my paper!

05:21.738 --> 05:23.489
(<i> giggling</i> )

05:29.954 --> 05:31.414
I'm getting
a little ticked here.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.208
How come you're the one
having the unlucky day

05:34.292 --> 05:36.294
while I'm the one
working for it?

05:36.377 --> 05:39.589
Every day is an unlucky day
when I'm commuting with you!

05:39.672 --> 05:41.549
{\an4}COURTNEY:
Care for
another, Mama?

05:41.632 --> 05:43.301
{\an4}MOTHER:
I'd love one,
thank you.

05:43.384 --> 05:48.431
{\an5}GINGER:
<i>It's like the Griplings</i>
<i>have this perfect family.</i>

05:48.514 --> 05:51.309
They say "please,"
they say "thank you,"

05:51.392 --> 05:53.269
they say "you're welcome."

05:53.352 --> 05:54.270
No fuss, no muss.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.105
And then there's my family.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.899
{\an1}The anti-
Griplings.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.234
GINGER:
Twice over.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.445
{\an5}DODIE:
You can't pick the family
you're born into.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.155
Sometimes it'd be nice
if you could.

06:04.238 --> 06:06.783
MACIE:
I know what you mean.

06:06.866 --> 06:07.950
Every now and then
I picture myself

06:08.034 --> 06:10.453
in a family of trapeze artists.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.955
But Macie,
you're afraid of heights.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.249
I know, that's why
when I picture it,

06:15.333 --> 06:17.168
I also picture a big safety net.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.753
I think what
Macie's saying

06:18.836 --> 06:20.046
{\an5}is that
we all wonder,
"what if"?

06:20.129 --> 06:21.297
Yeah, well, these days,

06:21.380 --> 06:24.550
I've been wondering
more than occasionally.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.139
This is perfect.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.933
{\an1}We can rig it
to the roof of my house,

06:32.016 --> 06:33.935
then when there's
a lightning storm,

06:34.018 --> 06:35.812
hello natural disaster.

06:35.895 --> 06:39.899
Technically, that's courting
danger, not bad luck.

06:39.982 --> 06:40.817
A minor detail.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.527
Anyway, there's not
a cloud in the sky.

06:42.610 --> 06:47.156
{\an1}Sorry, my friend, there's
going to be a storm today...

06:47.240 --> 06:47.865
I feel it.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.118
No, there isn't, Carl.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.828
I watched the weather channel
with my dad.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.540
{\an5}You and your dad
watch the weather
channel together?

06:55.623 --> 06:56.040
It's a bonding thing.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.209
My mom encourages it.

06:58.292 --> 06:58.793
(<i> cat meows</i> )

06:58.876 --> 07:00.586
A black cat!

07:00.670 --> 07:01.838
Maybe he'll
cross our path.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.339
That means
bad luck for sure.

07:03.422 --> 07:04.924
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

07:05.007 --> 07:08.386
Come on, come here.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.555
Oh! Darn cat.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.224
{\an5}He doesn't know
it's Friday,
the 13th, Carl.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.392
{\an1}Maybe we can find
a ladder to walk under.

07:14.475 --> 07:18.729
Well, okay, but they did
all the repainting last year.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.816
{\an1}Hoods, could you try to be
a little more positive

07:21.899 --> 07:22.859
about being negative?

07:22.942 --> 07:27.196
{\an5}This just might be harder
than we think, that's all.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.204
Way to work that tool, Buzz--

07:35.288 --> 07:37.039
not a shattered tile
in the bunch.

07:37.123 --> 07:40.042
Well, it's all in the wrist--
firm but gentle.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.711
Show 'em who's boss.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.297
And how!

07:44.672 --> 07:46.048
BUZZ:
Uh-uh.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.093
I don't like the looks of this
bulge here-- in your wall.

07:49.177 --> 07:52.138
Something's squeezing
off the water flow.

07:52.221 --> 07:53.598
(<i> gasps</i> )

07:53.681 --> 07:54.724
Holy kamody!

07:54.807 --> 07:57.393
You better get the fire
department on the line

07:57.476 --> 07:59.228
{\an1}and sooner
rather than later.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.229
Wh-what is it?

08:00.313 --> 08:01.063
What's wrong?

08:01.147 --> 08:02.148
And you can call me Lois.

08:02.231 --> 08:07.695
You've got yourself a vicious
mold problem here, Lois.

08:07.778 --> 08:09.071
{\an3}Vicious?

08:09.155 --> 08:11.073
{\an5}That's a pretty
strong word to
describe mold,

08:11.157 --> 08:12.450
{\an5}especially since
you can probably
take it out

08:12.533 --> 08:16.120
{\an5}with a foaming
cleanser and some
elbow grease.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.413
Not this kind of mold, Lois.

08:17.496 --> 08:20.082
I've only seen
this kind of mold once before

08:20.166 --> 08:21.751
and that was
on the disaster network.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.462
{\an1}This kind of mold
can destroy a house.

08:24.545 --> 08:29.842
{\an5}Oh, but I haven't
finished paying
for it yet.

08:31.552 --> 08:34.054
And then a big cement truck
plowed through it.

08:34.138 --> 08:36.057
{\an1}That's probably
the lamest excuse

08:36.140 --> 08:36.890
{\an1}you've ever
heard, right?

08:36.974 --> 08:39.602
Oh, I've heard lamer.

08:39.684 --> 08:43.063
{\an1}So, would it be okay
if I handed it in Monday?

08:43.147 --> 08:46.734
Of course, Ginger, no problem.

08:48.319 --> 08:48.778
Got an extension.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.696
Oh, I'm glad.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.782
Your day is turning around.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.033
It's about time.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.535
{\an1}I was starting to think
I was at Unlucky Junior High.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.496
ANNOUNCER:
Ginger Foutley, please report

08:58.579 --> 09:01.916
to the principal's
office immediately.

09:01.999 --> 09:04.335
Oh, no! Now what?

09:04.418 --> 09:07.922
CARL:
I found it in the trash.

09:08.005 --> 09:08.756
(<i> yells</i> )

09:08.839 --> 09:12.677
No opening an umbrella
indoors, Carl.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.428
Bad luck, you know.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.888
BOTH:
Duh-uh!

09:15.972 --> 09:17.807
Whole point, Brandonio.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.142
But Carl, I'm
starting to wonder.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.853
If you go around
looking for bad luck,

09:22.937 --> 09:24.355
how can you find it?

09:24.438 --> 09:25.606
Because if you do,

09:25.690 --> 09:28.025
then bad luck
becomes good luck,

09:28.109 --> 09:29.068
and then what?

09:29.151 --> 09:31.570
Boys, hate to rain
on your parade, Carl Foutley,

09:31.654 --> 09:35.366
but you're wanted in the
principal's office immediately.

09:35.449 --> 09:38.995
Brandon, you've got a sandwich
on your head.

09:39.078 --> 09:39.328
Oh!

09:39.412 --> 09:40.830
Get it off me,

09:40.913 --> 09:42.498
get it off me, get it off me!

09:42.581 --> 09:46.252
Could it finally be
some bad luck?

09:46.335 --> 09:47.336
I'm hoping.

09:47.420 --> 09:47.670
(<i> sniffs</i> )

09:47.753 --> 09:50.047
Ew!!

09:52.758 --> 09:56.679
Ginger, I'm afraid
a rare, lethal mold

09:56.762 --> 09:59.015
has been discovered
in your home.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.475
Your whole house
has to be tented.

10:01.559 --> 10:02.518
{\an1}You'll be given
ten minutes to go in

10:02.601 --> 10:05.396
{\an1}and retrieve your
valuable belongings.

10:05.479 --> 10:07.523
But you'll have
to wear regulation

10:07.606 --> 10:10.443
hazardous waste
disposal suits.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.029
Oh, no.

10:13.112 --> 10:13.821
Oh, yes!

10:13.904 --> 10:15.865
Gross!

10:15.948 --> 10:17.366
And, Ginger, need I say

10:17.450 --> 10:20.620
there's a lesson
in... hygiene here?

10:20.703 --> 10:22.038
(<i> chuckling</i> )

10:22.121 --> 10:23.080
Carl.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.498
{\an1}This is no time
for laughs.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.752
Our family will go down
in Friday, the 13th history.

10:27.835 --> 10:32.798
{\an1}I'll remind my mom
to pick up tile cleaner.

10:40.973 --> 10:45.102
Festering inside the Foutley
bathroom was a dirty secret,

10:45.186 --> 10:48.105
what officials are now calling
"the F-13 mold."

10:48.189 --> 10:49.899
Must be a slow news day.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.484
{\an5}Well, we just
got the word.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.235
We're being tented, too.

10:53.319 --> 10:53.778
{\an3}Oh, no.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.321
Don't tell me
they found

10:55.404 --> 10:56.530
our mold
in your house.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.658
{\an4}Nah, they're
only doing it
as a precaution.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.494
I'm really sorry, Darren.

11:01.577 --> 11:02.745
Don't worry about it.

11:02.828 --> 11:03.579
Where you staying?

11:03.662 --> 11:04.330
Oh, they'll be
staying with us.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.957
As you know, we have
a rumpus room.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.085
{\an4}Well, good luck
getting your
possessions.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.127
See you at school.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.463
Now, the only question is:

11:12.546 --> 11:14.173
what will you take with you?

11:14.256 --> 11:15.716
All I want
is my journal.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.760
But you always
carry it with you.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.678
And the one day
I forget it.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.138
{\an1}You know,
I'm beginning to think

11:21.222 --> 11:24.058
there really is something to
this Friday, the 13th stuff.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.352
We did it, Hoods.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.603
Success at last.

11:27.686 --> 11:28.854
I'd like to remind you,

11:28.938 --> 11:31.148
they're not tenting
my house, Carl.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.858
{\an1}It's success
for both of us.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.361
{\an1}Because you know
what the best part is?

11:35.444 --> 11:38.614
{\an1}It's a gift
that keeps on giving.

11:38.697 --> 11:39.782
You mean...

11:39.865 --> 11:43.494
{\an1}I'm going to collect
a mold specimen so powerful

11:43.577 --> 11:46.288
{\an1}it'll make your
gym sneakers jealous.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.125
{\an5}Do you really
want to be in
the mold business?

11:49.208 --> 11:50.751
{\an1}You're asking me
that question?

11:50.835 --> 11:53.963
Now, get into the library fast
and take out that book on mold.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.924
I've got to know
what precautions to take.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.008
I'll radio you.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.677
Give me 15 minutes.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.805
{\an1}They say it's a
stage-4 stachybotrys.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.974
No kidding!

12:05.683 --> 12:07.601
{\an5}REPORTER:
Let's get a word
with the little girl

12:07.685 --> 12:11.313
so accustomed to living
in deadly filth.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.022
Uh, Miss?

12:12.106 --> 12:19.113
(<i> breathing through gas mask</i> )

12:35.629 --> 12:36.839
Approaching target.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.174
Subject appears to be spreading.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.968
Keep it down, Carl.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.344
I'm in the library.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.973
Okay, now be ready to clamp down
on the lid of the jar

12:46.056 --> 12:47.892
as soon as you have the sample.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.810
Extreme caution urged, Carl.

12:49.894 --> 12:53.147
I repeat, extreme caution.

12:53.230 --> 12:53.606
{\an1}LOIS:
Carl!

12:53.689 --> 12:55.524
What are you doing?!

12:55.608 --> 12:57.359
You're supposed to be
gathering the things

12:57.443 --> 12:58.444
that matter most to you--
remember?

12:58.527 --> 13:01.614
But that's exactly
what I'm doing, Mom.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.492
You're not going
anywhere near that mold!

13:04.575 --> 13:05.784
End of argument.

13:05.868 --> 13:06.869
CARL:
Aw.

13:06.952 --> 13:10.122
Carl, I said
clamp down on the lid!!

13:10.206 --> 13:11.832
Shh, shh, shh!

13:14.043 --> 13:16.795
Oh, where are you?

13:31.644 --> 13:32.686
Uh, hey!

13:32.770 --> 13:35.314
{\an5}You'll have
your things back
in a few hours

13:35.397 --> 13:37.191
if the tests
come back negative

13:37.274 --> 13:38.943
after we
irradiate them.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.069
Irradiate?

13:40.152 --> 13:42.238
{\an5}Don't worry,
you'll get it
back in one piece.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.405
Your foot bath,
too, Mrs. Foutley.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.740
Oh, but I wanted to...

13:44.823 --> 13:47.910
{\an5}LOIS:
Ginger, he said
we'd get our stuff back.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.203
Now, let the man
do his job.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.330
Now, where's the exit
door on this thing?

13:51.413 --> 13:53.582
I'm getting hot.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.418
Ginger Foutley,
what possession did you take?

13:56.502 --> 13:57.628
Her diary, of course.

13:57.711 --> 13:58.420
She's always
scribbling in it.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.880
I took my electric foot bath.

13:59.964 --> 14:03.634
A nightly soak really softens
the corns, you know.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.511
What was it like in the house?

14:05.594 --> 14:07.930
{\an5}LOIS:
Same as always--
dishes in the sink,

14:08.013 --> 14:10.432
Carl's dirty underpants
on the doorknob.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.435
{\an1}Did you see this
so-called F-13 mold?

14:13.519 --> 14:14.436
Briefly.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.314
{\an5}But I've seen Carl
drag home scarier
looking stuff.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.567
And that's Carl with a "C."

14:19.650 --> 14:21.277
You said you
were disappointed

14:21.360 --> 14:23.487
you couldn't obtain
a mold sample?

14:23.571 --> 14:24.613
Oh, completely.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.116
I'm a total
mold and rot aficionado,

14:27.199 --> 14:29.368
{\an5}even collected
samples from
my mom's feet.

14:29.451 --> 14:31.620
You know
what they say:

14:31.704 --> 14:33.289
"healthcare
workers have

14:33.372 --> 14:34.790
the best fungus
among us."

14:34.873 --> 14:35.499
{\an1}GINGER:
I can't believe it!

14:35.583 --> 14:38.127
Would you look at
my mom and Carl.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.753
{\an5}Sometimes it's
better to just
face the press.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.632
{\an1}Otherwise, they just
hound you until you crack

14:43.716 --> 14:44.216
and then misquote you.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.802
{\an1}GINGER:
Face them?

14:46.885 --> 14:48.387
{\an1}They're
enjoying it!

14:48.470 --> 14:50.472
I can't believe
you just stood there

14:50.556 --> 14:52.516
and told the whole world
about our business.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.060
I figure they'd
find out anyway

14:55.144 --> 14:57.062
so I might as well
put our spin on it.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.815
I don't think
you should have revealed things

14:59.898 --> 15:01.150
about our disgusting family.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.027
Ginger!

15:03.110 --> 15:04.528
{\an1}That's your mom
you're talking to.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.698
Maybe we should continue this
conversation at the Bishops.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.950
You continue it
at the Bishops.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.577
Ginger,
aren't you coming?

15:11.660 --> 15:13.370
{\an1}I'm not an expert
on families,

15:13.454 --> 15:15.956
{\an1}but shouldn't you
try to stick together?

15:18.876 --> 15:21.670
Ginger, I want you to know this
is fascinating entertainment.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.423
{\an1}And now you've
been left homeless.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.508
Great third act.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.177
(<i> snickering</i> )

15:28.260 --> 15:29.678
LOIS:
She's not homeless.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.221
She's been
invited to stay

15:31.305 --> 15:32.640
in the Bishop's
rumpus room

15:32.723 --> 15:34.475
with the rest
of her family.

15:34.558 --> 15:36.268
I don't have a family.

15:36.352 --> 15:37.227
I have a circus act!

15:37.311 --> 15:39.688
Rumpus room?

15:39.772 --> 15:40.606
Miranda?

15:40.689 --> 15:41.315
It's a family room.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.400
Uh, family room?

15:43.484 --> 15:44.276
Like a living room

15:44.360 --> 15:46.904
with plaid furniture
and a pullout sofa.

15:46.987 --> 15:47.655
How did she know?

15:47.738 --> 15:52.159
Pullout?
Into what, I wonder?

15:52.242 --> 15:54.787
{\an1}Probably multi-hued
shag carpeting.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.081
Oh, Ginger, you can't.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.874
{\an1}We've just completed
the unexpected guest wing.

15:58.957 --> 16:02.586
{\an1}You can stay till your
moldy old house is clean.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.381
It might even
improve your image.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.466
{\an1}Oh, you're invited too,
Mrs. Foutley.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.134
Thanks, Courtney,
but I've already

16:09.218 --> 16:11.679
taken the Bishops up
on their offer...

16:11.762 --> 16:13.639
and so has Ginger.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.432
No, I haven't.

16:15.516 --> 16:15.891
{\an3}Ginger.

16:15.974 --> 16:17.559
Thanks, Courtney,

16:17.643 --> 16:20.145
I'd love to
stay with you.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.784
And of course
we have a button

16:33.867 --> 16:35.577
for just about
everything--

16:35.661 --> 16:36.578
lights, TV, music.

16:36.662 --> 16:40.249
Wow... this room
sure is big.

16:40.332 --> 16:43.001
Our architect calls it
"modern chateau."

16:43.085 --> 16:44.253
And can you believe it?

16:44.336 --> 16:45.671
This is only the bedroom.

16:45.754 --> 16:48.424
There's a living room,
dining room, screening room.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.259
In just this wing?

16:50.342 --> 16:52.302
Privacy is important,
don't you think?

16:52.386 --> 16:54.596
I sure do.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.724
I mean, I certainly
wouldn't want to be burdened

16:56.807 --> 16:59.435
by other people's...
well, noises.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.563
Anyway, dinner's at 7:00.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.606
{\an5}Oh, hey--
you want to hang
out or something?

17:04.690 --> 17:07.483
Hmm... maybe later.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.611
I need my alone time.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.780
If you need anything, just call.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.031
Call?

17:13.115 --> 17:15.784
Hey, if I need anything,
I'll just walk to your room.

17:15.867 --> 17:16.743
Oh, I suppose.

17:16.827 --> 17:20.455
But it's an awfully long walk.

17:26.377 --> 17:29.965
This'll be, uh... just great.

17:30.048 --> 17:31.508
Thanks, Joanne.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.009
Uh-huh.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.886
No, uh... no problem.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.846
We love
having you here.

17:35.929 --> 17:36.972
The only reason
we're staying here

17:37.055 --> 17:39.725
is because Carl
can walk to school

17:39.808 --> 17:42.060
and I can take the bus to work.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.020
Uh-huh.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.773
Now, right through there
is the bathroom.

17:45.856 --> 17:48.859
Not a spore in sight.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.569
Joanne, they
said the mold

17:50.652 --> 17:52.154
had probably
been growing

17:52.237 --> 17:54.782
since before I
bought the house.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.116
Of course.

17:56.200 --> 18:00.204
Well, uh... dinner should be
ready in about an hour.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.914
Need any help?

18:01.997 --> 18:04.792
Uh... no, no.

18:05.459 --> 18:06.502
(<i> sighs</i> )

18:06.585 --> 18:08.879
{\an5}CARL:
So instead of collecting
a lethal mold sample

18:08.962 --> 18:12.633
the good luck is
us rooming together

18:12.716 --> 18:13.467
for a few days.

18:13.550 --> 18:17.179
{\an1}Carl, my mom just
washed the bedspread.

18:17.262 --> 18:20.599
Does that mean you want me
to take my shoes off?

18:20.682 --> 18:21.099
Yeah.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.893
That's what it means.

18:23.352 --> 18:27.898
{\an1}Still hurts we didn't get
that mold sample, doesn't it?

18:27.981 --> 18:28.732
Uh-huh.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.359
I know, I'm feeling it, too.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.860
So... what do you want to do?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.654
I bet there's plenty
of mischief to be made

18:33.737 --> 18:35.030
in the Bishop
household.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.742
{\an1}The thing of it is,
I'm trying to do my homework.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.202
I do my homework until 5:30.

18:40.285 --> 18:43.205
{\an4}Then I go and
watch TV with my dad
when he comes home.

18:43.288 --> 18:48.418
We're not talking the
weather channel again, are we?

18:48.502 --> 18:49.461
It's a choice, Carl.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.213
And there's a
tropical depression

18:51.296 --> 18:53.799
building off the
western coast of Mexico.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.592
We're... kind of
watching it.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.969
{\an1}Wouldn't
you know it--

18:57.052 --> 18:59.513
bad luck turned to good luck

18:59.596 --> 19:01.890
and now it's just boring luck.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.059
GINGER:
Uh... (<i> clears throat</i> )

19:04.143 --> 19:09.565
so, uh... should we
just dig in, or...?

19:09.648 --> 19:10.774
We're waiting for Mr. Gripling.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.651
Daddy's running
a little late.

19:12.734 --> 19:15.195
Work keeps him
very busy.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.738
Oh... right. Gotcha.

19:16.822 --> 19:17.865
Oh, by the way, thanks.

19:17.948 --> 19:22.411
I mean, thank you for loaning me
the outfit, Courtney.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.495
Oh, you're welcome.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.913
We always dress for dinner.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.915
Shows the proper
discipline.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.458
Yeah, I know what you mean.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.670
It's kind of hard to slurp
your soup in a dress like this.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.505
(<i> laughs nervously</i> )

19:33.589 --> 19:39.469
{\an5}Mama, what does
"slurp your soup"
mean?

19:39.553 --> 19:41.597
I'm not sure.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.808
(<i> whispering</i> )

19:44.892 --> 19:47.978
Good news-- father's here.

19:48.061 --> 19:52.274
Oh, wow, I finally get to meet
the mysterious Mr. Gripling.

19:56.194 --> 19:59.615
Mr. Gripling
is on line one, Madam.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.950
Thank you,
Winston.

20:02.659 --> 20:03.827
Hello, dear.

20:03.911 --> 20:04.870
{\an1}Hi, Daddy.

20:04.953 --> 20:05.662
Ah, Father.

20:05.746 --> 20:06.538
VOICE:
Hello, all.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.625
{\an5}Prescott,
we have company
this evening.

20:09.708 --> 20:10.751
VOICE:
Oh?

20:10.834 --> 20:11.376
Anyone I know.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.837
{\an1}It's Ginger
Foutley, Daddy--

20:13.921 --> 20:14.755
the mold girl.

20:14.838 --> 20:15.672
VOICE:
Well, hello, Ginger.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.716
Nice to meet you.

20:17.799 --> 20:20.510
Uh... hi, Mr. Gripling.

20:20.594 --> 20:25.098
Nice to meet you, too.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.728
{\an5}BRANDON:
Cross my Western Front,
will you?

20:29.811 --> 20:32.814
Take that, Carl Foutley!

20:32.898 --> 20:35.817
(<i> sighs loudly</i> )

20:35.901 --> 20:40.322
(<i> slow ticking</i> )

20:45.577 --> 20:47.579
(<i> doorbell rings</i> )

20:47.663 --> 20:50.958
Uh... do you want
me to get the...?

20:51.041 --> 20:54.002
{\an1}No, that's
all right, dear.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.963
Winston will see to it.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.340
A visitor to see you, Miss.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.884
Me?

21:02.678 --> 21:05.138
Oh.

21:05.222 --> 21:06.181
Ginger Foutley?

21:06.264 --> 21:06.974
Uh-huh.

21:07.057 --> 21:07.849
{\an1}This is
from your mother.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.476
Said you'd want it.

21:09.559 --> 21:12.145
{\an1}Sign here.

21:14.731 --> 21:15.399
Did my mom say anything?

21:15.482 --> 21:17.859
No, but there was
this annoying kid

21:17.943 --> 21:20.070
who tried to buy
your diary off me.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.613
Oh... Carl.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.407
Like I can be bought.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.788
{\an5}REPORTER (<i> on TV</i> ):
Did you see this so-called
F-13 mold?

21:29.871 --> 21:35.252
{\an5}MOTHER:
Briefly, but I've seen Carl
drag home scarier looking stuff.

21:35.335 --> 21:36.837
And that's Carl with a "C."

21:36.920 --> 21:39.339
You said you
were disappointed

21:39.423 --> 21:41.049
you couldn't obtain
a mold sample?

21:41.133 --> 21:44.803
{\an5}GINGER:
"They said take the things
that mean the most to you.

21:44.886 --> 21:46.972
"I think I left them behind.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.432
"Why is it when you have time

21:48.515 --> 21:51.476
"to think about stuff
you did in a moment of crisis

21:51.560 --> 21:57.482
you suddenly have big regrets
and feel... lonely?"

21:58.108 --> 22:00.694
JOANNE (<i> yawning</i> ):
Oh, Ginger?

22:00.777 --> 22:04.322
{\an5}You didn't come
all this way by
yourself, did you?

22:04.406 --> 22:05.741
Winston dropped me off.

22:05.824 --> 22:06.533
{\an3}LOIS:
Ginge?

22:07.826 --> 22:08.869
{\an1}DODIE:
Ginger?

22:08.952 --> 22:09.911
Hi, Dodie.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.246
I'm sorry I was so...

22:11.329 --> 22:14.541
Obnoxious, obstinate,
ungrateful?

22:14.624 --> 22:16.084
Yeah, all the above.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.336
Talk to you tomorrow, okay?

22:18.420 --> 22:20.255
{\an1}Come on,
Deirdre Hortense.

22:20.338 --> 22:21.673
{\an1}It's late.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.012
I missed you guys.

22:27.095 --> 22:27.804
Um... I'm sorry.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.223
We missed you, too.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.641
And we're sorry, too.

22:31.725 --> 22:35.228
Maybe sometimes we are
like a circus family.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.773
But with the emphasis on family.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.608
(<i> both sigh</i> )

22:39.691 --> 22:40.776
It may not be
the Griplings,

22:40.859 --> 22:42.903
{\an1}but there's plenty of room,
and boy, is it clean!
