WEBVTT

00:02.969 --> 00:04.803
Finally, after a year,

00:04.805 --> 00:06.005
I'm here with Chewy.

00:06.007 --> 00:08.807
And we're back in New York City.

00:08.809 --> 00:11.043
Kleinfeld, here I come.

00:11.811 --> 00:13.846
Oh, Randy!

00:13.848 --> 00:16.315
- You have your roller skates on?
- Of course I'm ready!

00:16.317 --> 00:18.417
- We're booked solid.
- I'm ready, baby!

00:18.419 --> 00:20.819
- Hello, beautiful ladies!
- Hello, ladies!

00:20.821 --> 00:25.057
It'll be full circle if I fall in
love with a dress by Randy.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.392
- [gasping]
- That's the Beyoncé dress!

00:26.394 --> 00:27.760
You're a genius!

00:27.762 --> 00:30.929
[Lisette] Elaina? Somebody
go get her. Where is she going?

00:30.931 --> 00:33.799
My sister,
she's a piece of work.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.567
She's not even listening
to our input

00:35.569 --> 00:38.737
when we know what the look is.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.406
And that's the nicest thing
I can say.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.708
Would you even be able
to pull that off?

00:42.710 --> 00:45.044
- [Candace] Absolutely.
- I don't know, Candace.

00:45.046 --> 00:46.678
- Are you ready for your bride?
- Yes.

00:46.680 --> 00:51.350
I'm very anxious about seeing
the dress for the first time.

00:51.352 --> 00:55.654
If my mom doesn't like it,
I'm gonna be a little upset.

00:55.656 --> 00:59.358
I would not put this on the same
level as the Beyoncé one. Uh-uh.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.861
I think she wants, more than
anything, to wear your dress.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.531
I don't know. Is my gut wrong? Is
my head wrong? Is my heart wrong?

01:05.533 --> 01:07.833
I don't care whose dress it is.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.802
I don't know. It's kind of giving
me prom vibes, or something.

01:09.804 --> 01:12.004
The prom?

01:12.006 --> 01:14.606
What kind of girl would
wear this to a prom?

01:14.608 --> 01:16.308
I would wear it to the prom.

01:17.110 --> 01:18.610
[Elaina]
<i>I need you guys to trust me.</i>

01:18.612 --> 01:19.812
<i>This is my dress.</i>

01:19.814 --> 01:21.914
This is not a...
a "we" situation.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.115
I don't wanna ugly cry.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.383
But, I can't help it.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.935
Oh, wow. [chuckles]

01:42.937 --> 01:46.338
It feels so amazing

01:46.340 --> 01:48.307
<i>to be back here at Kleinfeld.</i>

01:48.309 --> 01:50.776
<i>I spoke to Ronnie a few
weeks ago about a trunk show.</i>

01:50.778 --> 01:53.979
I didn't know if I was gonna
actually be able to make it here.

01:53.981 --> 01:55.647
But I literally moved mountains

01:55.649 --> 01:57.182
and here I am.

01:57.184 --> 02:00.152
Yeah, look. Look at this,
Chewy. It's all different.

02:00.887 --> 02:01.954
Yeah.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.789
- [Dorothy] Chewy!
- [Ronnie] Chewy!

02:03.791 --> 02:05.257
- Chewy's here!
- [Dorothy] What are you doing here, Chewy?

02:05.259 --> 02:06.959
Chewy. Where's Randy?

02:06.961 --> 02:08.694
- [Ronnie] If Chewy's here, Randy's here.
- [Randy] Who is that?

02:08.696 --> 02:11.997
- [Dorothy] Oh, Randy!
- Oh, Dorothy!

02:11.999 --> 02:15.134
I feel like I haven't
seen you in ages.

02:15.136 --> 02:15.968
- You haven't!
- I love you!

02:15.970 --> 02:17.870
You haven't changed a bit!

02:17.872 --> 02:20.772
I'm outta COVID jail! Ronnie!

02:20.774 --> 02:23.108
<i>Only Dorothy and Ronnie</i>

02:23.110 --> 02:24.676
know that I'm gonna
be here today.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.112
<i>The brides don't know, and
the consultants don't know.</i>

02:27.114 --> 02:28.947
So, this should really be fun.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.583
- Marissa!
- What is all the commotion?

02:31.585 --> 02:32.684
Finally! In person.

02:32.686 --> 02:33.719
I've been waiting
five months for this.

02:33.721 --> 02:37.422
- Randy, oh, my God!
- My Mindalisious!

02:37.424 --> 02:39.725
- It's so nice to see you not on a screen anymore.
- Right?

02:39.727 --> 02:41.660
Looking at the ceiling,
and the floors.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.829
- By the way, he came here with new gorgeous dresses.
- Yes!

02:43.831 --> 02:45.764
- Awesome!
- He came with Chewy.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.600
It is so amazing to be back.
To be able to hug people.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.801
To be able to do what I love,

02:49.803 --> 02:52.004
in person. To be outta
the house!

02:52.006 --> 02:53.505
- Do you have your roller skates on?
- Of course I'm ready.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.542
- We're booked solid. Listen to me.
- I'm ready, baby!

02:56.544 --> 02:58.710
I'm gonna get you set up. Come
on, bring your pet. Bring your bag,

02:58.712 --> 03:00.212
and I'm gonna take you
in the back. Come on.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.680
- Come on. Come on.
- Chewy! Where's Chewy?

03:01.682 --> 03:02.581
- Let's do it.
- Chewy!

03:02.583 --> 03:04.316
- I'll catch you later.
- Come on, Randal!

03:04.318 --> 03:05.684
- [Randy] Okay, nice seeing you.
- Where's Chewy?

03:05.686 --> 03:08.020
He's probably out in the lobby
greeting people.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.622
- Yay, I'm so happy you're here.
- Me too.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.225
- So pretty!
- I know it!

03:16.029 --> 03:18.830
All right. Let me grab
a couple clips.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.400
So, I know I have a bride
that's coming in that

03:21.402 --> 03:24.403
if it's exactly
who I think it is, oh, boy!

03:24.405 --> 03:25.904
[squealing]

03:25.906 --> 03:27.806
- This is so exciting!
- See, like those ones back there.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.741
I know, it's so cute.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.777
<i>[Candace] She was here
a couple months ago.</i>

03:31.779 --> 03:34.980
She came with her mom
and her sister.

03:34.982 --> 03:38.317
And, they were full of energy.
But, they were

03:38.319 --> 03:40.719
full of opinions.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.354
- I don't like that. I don't like that at all.
- What do you mean?

03:42.356 --> 03:43.855
- It's beautiful.
- It's elegant.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.658
- [Jill] Wait!
- You don't need all that extra... Elaina!

03:46.660 --> 03:48.727
Somebody go get her.
Where is she going?

03:48.729 --> 03:50.929
- [Elaina squealing]
- Oh, my God.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.999
I came here a couple months
ago with my mom and sister.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.701
I found something that I loved.

03:55.703 --> 03:56.702
<i>But it was shot down</i>

03:56.704 --> 03:58.704
<i>very quickly by them.</i>

03:58.706 --> 04:01.106
<i>It was a crazy,
intense experience.</i>

04:01.108 --> 04:02.741
So, yeah.
Now I'm back

04:02.743 --> 04:03.842
to find something else.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.044
See, like simple.
Simple silhouette.

04:06.046 --> 04:09.848
I don't know why she's
running to all the jewels.

04:09.850 --> 04:10.916
[Jill]
All right, let's focus.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.918
- [Lisette] Yeah, okay. Bring it in.
- Let's focus.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.687
I mean, I'm not gonna say
it was totally my fault,

04:15.689 --> 04:16.421
but I feel like it's a little
my fault.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.857
I personally think, that

04:18.859 --> 04:22.561
<i>my direction came off a little
harsher than what I intended...</i>

04:22.563 --> 04:26.531
- That is exactly what happened.
- Yeah, I apologize.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.834
[Lisette] <i>I just feel like
I didn't get that "wow,</i>

04:28.836 --> 04:30.836
warm and fuzzy,
I want to cry" feeling.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.238
And you know,
maybe this time, I will.

04:33.973 --> 04:36.041
You could shine
with a simple dress.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.843
- Think about...
- You don't need the crazy.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.344
I'm not simple.

04:39.679 --> 04:44.116
My sister wants me to be
in this modern dress.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.718
I want to be walking down the
aisle in like diamonds and flowers.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.653
That's me.

04:47.655 --> 04:50.856
<i>But, I really trust
my sister's opinion,</i>

04:50.858 --> 04:53.592
<i>and I'm really trying to keep
an open mind this time around.</i>

04:53.594 --> 04:55.327
So... yeah.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.031
- Oh, my God.
- [Elaina squealing]

04:59.033 --> 05:00.966
Thank goodness.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.101
[Jill]
Thank goodness she's here.

05:04.871 --> 05:07.939
Oh, my goodness.

05:08.908 --> 05:10.742
Candace, you have to tell her.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.444
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.879
We've gotta talk
some sense into her.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.648
- Yes, she's... Same as last time.
- What's happening?

05:16.650 --> 05:17.616
She's not even listening
to our input

05:17.618 --> 05:20.786
when we know what the look is.

05:20.788 --> 05:25.257
- When you know what the look is for... her wedding?
- Exactly. For me.

05:25.259 --> 05:27.659
- Our wedding?
- Well, I mean... But my look is the look.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.062
We're gonna have a different
time this time. That's all I'm saying.

05:30.064 --> 05:31.863
That's the goal.
That is the goal.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.732
This time around...

05:33.734 --> 05:35.867
we have a better idea
of what we want. Right?

05:35.869 --> 05:36.935
Yes. We have a better idea
of what we want.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.004
We have a clear idea.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.872
- Still sparkles, still diamonds.
- Okay.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.574
Still gorgeous and glamorous.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.408
Just like last time.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.776
- Just like last time. Okay.
- Yeah.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.678
I mean, I definitely think

05:46.680 --> 05:49.581
that she did
a lot of sweetheart necklines,

05:49.583 --> 05:53.085
so maybe just like a different
neckline or a different vibe.

05:53.087 --> 05:56.054
<i>So because Elaina is so petite,</i>

05:56.056 --> 05:58.023
I would love to see her in

05:58.025 --> 06:00.659
something that's
not so crazy, like,

06:00.661 --> 06:02.594
no crazy bedazzled,

06:02.596 --> 06:05.530
<i>like just a simple,
really nice silhouette.</i>

06:05.532 --> 06:08.700
Yeah, I need to see something
that's not gonna overpower her.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.603
What does you fiance
have in mind for you?

06:11.605 --> 06:14.906
Or does he have anything in
particular that he wants to see you in?

06:14.908 --> 06:18.076
He likes for me
to look beautiful

06:18.078 --> 06:18.977
and shine like the star I am.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.912
[chuckles]

06:20.914 --> 06:22.647
Shaun and I met each other
as children,

06:22.649 --> 06:23.849
<i>our parents were family friends</i>

06:23.851 --> 06:25.884
<i>and once we both graduated,</i>

06:25.886 --> 06:27.686
<i>um, college,
he reached out to me.</i>

06:27.688 --> 06:29.688
<i>I said to my mom, "I don't know,</i>

06:29.690 --> 06:32.891
<i>is this the little boy that I remember
from the basement parties?"</i>

06:32.893 --> 06:34.860
<i>And she said, "No. Give
it a try. He's a nice guy."</i>

06:34.862 --> 06:37.562
<i>It did not take much for me
to fall in love with Shaun.</i>

06:37.564 --> 06:42.934
<i>He's kind, funny,
sweet, hardworking.</i>

06:42.936 --> 06:45.604
<i>Every quality that I would
want in a husband...</i>

06:45.638 --> 06:47.672
he is.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.841
- I'm gonna steal you. You're gonna come with me.
- Okay.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.543
And I'll have
you two lovely ladies...

06:51.545 --> 06:53.678
- have a seat over there.
- Okay.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.580
- Thank you some much, Candace.
- [Candace] All right, welcome.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.015
Thank you.
We'll see you guys soon.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.785
-Let the show begin
-[Jill] Let the show begin!

06:59.787 --> 07:01.853
[Elaina squeals]
Ah! I'm excited. I'm excited.

07:01.887 --> 07:03.822
So there is no budget for today.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.758
My mom is gifting me the
dress as my wedding present,

07:06.760 --> 07:10.061
<i>so I really wanna
feel special today.</i>

07:10.063 --> 07:12.697
I wanna feel like a bride.
I want to just feel like

07:12.699 --> 07:14.633
how I've always
dreamed of feeling.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.501
- There was a dress...
- Yeah.

07:16.503 --> 07:18.570
That you loved
the last time you were here.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.472
- Is that one dress still relevant?
- Yes.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.140
<i>Or did we kinda kick
that out completely?</i>

07:22.142 --> 07:23.375
<i>[Elaina] I wanna see
what else is out there.</i>

07:23.377 --> 07:25.877
- Maybe we can try on the dress that I loved before.
- Okay.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.713
See if I got the same feeling but I
do wanna see what else is out there.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.382
We're always on the same team.

07:30.384 --> 07:31.683
- We're always on the same team.
- Always on the same team.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.951
- Me and you. You and I. We got this.
- Yes.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.086
- Teamwork.
- I'm ready. Thank you, Candace.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.321
You're welcome, love.
I'll be right back.

07:36.323 --> 07:37.756
Thank you.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.625
<i>[Candace] So, I'm thinking
we're gonna do a quick 180,</i>

07:40.627 --> 07:42.828
because even though
she loved it,

07:42.830 --> 07:46.932
they're here again to see
something new, not the same things.

07:46.934 --> 07:50.135
Ugh... I'm nervous
about the sister.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.538
<i>I have a dress in mind that I wanna
bring that I think she's gonna like.</i>

07:53.540 --> 07:55.106
Got it.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.409
And I also think her sister's
gonna like as well.

07:58.811 --> 07:59.611
[Elaina] Yes.

07:59.613 --> 08:03.682
- Elaina!
- [squeals] Hi.

08:03.684 --> 08:08.720
- I've got some good dresses here for you.
- Okay!

08:08.722 --> 08:10.755
- So...
- I see some glitter.

08:10.757 --> 08:13.592
- Yes. We have glitter.
- I love that.

08:13.594 --> 08:17.562
- We have clean. For your sister.
- I don't know...

08:17.564 --> 08:19.698
[Elaina] So simple,
and just like...

08:19.700 --> 08:22.734
I'm not simple. So we'll try,
but I don't know.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.437
Last time,
I really was tunnel vision,

08:25.439 --> 08:27.873
and this time,
I'm trying to just...

08:27.875 --> 08:33.011
be more accepting of different styles
and different shapes, so we'll see.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.081
I love the fact that it
accentuates my figure.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.983
It makes me look tall.

08:37.985 --> 08:41.987
Okay, this fits snug.
I look good.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.755
- Ooh, the buttons.
- [chuckles]

08:43.757 --> 08:45.357
I did not see the buttons!

08:45.359 --> 08:48.293
I can appreciate it. It's still pretty
but there's something missing.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.529
- Let's see what they say. Let's see what they say.
- Okay.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.965
It's important for me to
show my family this dress,

08:53.967 --> 08:57.068
<i>because they wanted to see me
in a plain dress. I'm in a plain dress.</i>

08:58.137 --> 09:00.672
Aww.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.974
- Stop!
- Ah! Okay.

09:02.976 --> 09:07.112
- Okay, let's see.
- That's a good response.

09:08.981 --> 09:10.181
- Okay.
- [Candace] What do we think?

09:10.850 --> 09:12.217
What do you think?

09:13.753 --> 09:17.756
Okay. So I love
how simple it is.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.724
I-- I-- Is it the one?

09:19.726 --> 09:21.860
I don't think so particularly.

09:21.862 --> 09:25.764
I'm not in love with the straps.

09:25.766 --> 09:29.200
Yeah, but you know what?
I put this on for you.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.403
- So, it's...
- Okay.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.238
[Jill] I feel like I can't
believe we're saying this.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.707
This is what we asked
you to put on, we know that.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.976
But I'm a little underwhelmed,
now that I see it.

09:38.544 --> 09:40.712
It's almost as if
they never left.

09:40.714 --> 09:44.950
I walked back into the trio of
who's right and who's wrong.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.519
I don't know, it's kinda giving
me prom vibes or something.

09:47.521 --> 09:49.020
- It's not giving me--
- The prom?

09:49.022 --> 09:50.822
- This dress? Prom?
- Yeah. It's not giving me bride.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.892
Prom?
Who would wear this to a prom?

09:53.894 --> 09:56.695
With the neckline,
I'm getting like very prom.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.997
What kind of girl would
wear this to a prom?

09:59.432 --> 10:01.132
I would wear it to the prom.

10:02.535 --> 10:05.136
[upbeat music playing]

10:07.473 --> 10:09.674
[Dorothy] Let me show you. Let
me show you where the dresses are.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.042
- [Randy] Okay. 'Cause I think there's...
- Hold on.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.978
- That you need to get out.
- Yeah, yeah, they're right here.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.112
Okay, this is last season.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.447
- This is Belinda.
- Okay.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.816
- So we should bring this one out.
- Okay.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.951
Okay. That one you can leave. That one
you can leave. And this one you can leave.

10:19.953 --> 10:20.885
- Okay, okay.
- Hello.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.821
Randy. Hello.
How's it going?

10:22.823 --> 10:23.788
- We're just pulling dresses.
- Hey, Mindy.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.956
Hi, Dorothy.
How's it going?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.658
- We're gonna bring some more dresses out.
- Yeah.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.593
So I have a bride.
She just came in.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.029
- First one of the day?
- First one of the day.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.530
Don't worry, I'll get the dresses
out afterwards. Thank you.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.866
All right, no problem.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.001
- Thanks, Dorothy. I don't mean to steal him away.
- No, no, no. That's okay.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.035
Brides are calling.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.804
Oh, my God.
This is so exciting.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.606
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.041
- Wow.
- Wait, stop.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.810
My inspiration to become
a fashion designer

10:45.812 --> 10:48.413
<i>definitely started with
Say Yes to the Dress.</i>

10:48.415 --> 10:49.848
- Oh, my God. Wait.
- Oh, my God, the feathers.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.383
You wanna try feathers?
[gasps]

10:51.385 --> 10:53.518
<i>[Kimberly] You really see
the magic</i>

10:53.520 --> 10:55.120
<i>of the design industry</i>

10:55.122 --> 10:57.455
<i>that moment where
the bride turns around,</i>

10:57.457 --> 10:59.791
<i>she has the veil on
and the dress of her dreams,</i>

10:59.793 --> 11:01.860
<i>and like nothing else
in the world matters,</i>

11:01.862 --> 11:04.629
<i>except for that moment
and how she feels.</i>

11:04.631 --> 11:07.632
And that's how knew
this is where I belong.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.734
Oh, my God.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:09.736 --> 11:11.102
- I like this one.
- Is this the...

11:11.104 --> 11:12.837
- It is! It's the Beyoncé dress.
- [gasps]

11:12.839 --> 11:13.805
It's the Beyoncé dress?

11:13.807 --> 11:15.807
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Pull it, pull it, pull it.

11:15.809 --> 11:18.743
It'd be full circle if I
saw Randy today. Um...

11:18.745 --> 11:22.080
And if Randy is here today,
I do have a gift to give him.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.015
- Hold this.
- Okay.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.016
He's gonna appreciate it.

11:25.584 --> 11:27.952
- [Randy] Ah. Here they are.
- [Mindy] Yeah.

11:27.954 --> 11:28.853
- Hello, beautiful ladies.
- Hello, ladies.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.789
[gasps]

11:30.791 --> 11:32.724
- [Monica] Oh, wow.
- [laughs]

11:32.726 --> 11:33.658
- Hello.
- Oh, my God.

11:33.660 --> 11:34.793
- I'm Randy.
- Oh, my God.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.294
- [Monica] This is not real life.
- [all chuckle]

11:36.296 --> 11:37.195
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.329
- Oh, my God.
- How are you?

11:38.331 --> 11:39.397
I'm fantastic now.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.667
- So you're the bride, obviously.
- I am the bride.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.335
- Hi, Kim.
- And who do you have with you?

11:44.337 --> 11:46.671
I have my matron of honor,
Rachel.

11:46.673 --> 11:49.507
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hello beautiful, Rachel, how are you? And you are?

11:49.509 --> 11:52.043
- Monica.
- Monica, nice to meet you.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.678
- [Mindy] You guys look fabulous.
- Thank you.

11:53.680 --> 11:57.148
- It's like a fashion play.
- Every time we go out, we have a dress code.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.717
<i>[Randy] I guess pink's
the color of the day, right?</i>

11:58.719 --> 12:00.919
<i>[Mindy] Obviously.</i>

12:00.921 --> 12:03.021
[Kimberly] Um, I'm actually
a fashion designer.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.989
- You are!
- And so is Rachel.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.291
And so is Monica.

12:06.293 --> 12:09.094
- [Mindy] Okay, all right.
- All three of you are fashion designers?

12:09.096 --> 12:12.030
- Yes!
- Wow, what kind of fashion do you design?

12:12.032 --> 12:13.598
Bridal evening wear.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.034
- [both] Really!
- Yeah.

12:16.869 --> 12:18.670
If you're a
bridal gown designer,

12:18.672 --> 12:21.206
why aren't you
designing your own dress?

12:21.208 --> 12:23.174
Sometimes you like start
putting it together

12:23.176 --> 12:25.710
and you think
you know what you want,

12:25.712 --> 12:26.878
<i>and you don't.</i>

12:26.880 --> 12:29.781
<i>And then, at that point,
what am I gonna do?</i>

12:29.783 --> 12:32.283
Creating a dress is
like building a house.

12:33.719 --> 12:35.453
- Yeah, I hear you.
- So...

12:35.455 --> 12:38.022
So what are you looking for,
do you have an idea in mind?

12:38.024 --> 12:41.826
I do. And my idea is called
Beyoncé, and she's right over there.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.661
Oh, my God!
Can I tell you,

12:43.663 --> 12:46.965
that is one of my... I mean,
there're all my babies...

12:46.967 --> 12:49.334
- I know.
- But that's one of my favorite children.

12:50.636 --> 12:51.402
[Mindy]
<i>You really need a wow factor.</i>

12:51.404 --> 12:54.139
<i>I can just already tell, Kim,</i>

12:54.141 --> 12:56.574
<i>you are not going to settle for
anything less than the wow factor.</i>

12:56.576 --> 13:00.979
I need like impact, drama...
Glam is the plan.

13:00.981 --> 13:04.849
Have you tried on
wedding dresses elsewhere?

13:04.851 --> 13:07.385
- Um, I went to one other place.
- Okay.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.420
Was there anything
that you loved?

13:09.422 --> 13:11.523
I like that first one
the best. The first ball gown.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.258
It was like the Lazaro.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.593
- [Monica] <i>Oh, the Lazaro ball gown.
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

13:15.595 --> 13:18.096
[Kimberly] <i>And it had this asymmetric
layer on top. It was gorgeous.</i>

13:18.098 --> 13:20.598
You like the ball gown
silhouette?

13:20.600 --> 13:21.733
Ball gowns or mermaids.

13:21.735 --> 13:25.436
Which is opposite ends
of the spectrum.

13:25.438 --> 13:28.973
Okay, so I like a lot of
things, but I don't like plain.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.343
- How much would you like to spend?
- Um, 10,000.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.711
- Oh, that's plenty.
- That's great.

13:33.713 --> 13:36.414
So, is there anything else we
should know before we start shopping?

13:36.416 --> 13:39.184
Oh, I mean, just that I have
the best fiance in all the land.

13:39.186 --> 13:39.784
Really?

13:39.786 --> 13:41.820
His name is Anthony Kormono.

13:41.822 --> 13:45.723
<i>We started dating when we were
15 and 16 years old in high school.</i>

13:45.725 --> 13:48.393
- Oh, that is so cute.
- High-school sweethearts!

13:48.395 --> 13:51.796
Not to brag but
I did hit the lottery of men.

13:51.798 --> 13:54.999
<i>He's funny, he's caring.
He's wicked smart.</i>

13:55.001 --> 13:56.334
<i>Obviously, very handsome.</i>

13:56.502 --> 13:58.303
<i>Um, romantic.</i>

13:58.305 --> 14:01.406
<i>And he's my rock for when
I'm going through a crisis</i>

14:01.408 --> 14:03.908
<i>or I think I'm going
through a crisis, and I'm not.</i>

14:03.910 --> 14:05.410
He brings me back down to earth,

14:05.412 --> 14:07.111
which is where I need to be.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.881
[Mindy] Come on in!

14:09.883 --> 14:12.050
There we go! [grunts]

14:12.052 --> 14:13.484
- [Randy] There goes my arm.
- Oh, so beautiful.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.119
So what's this?

14:15.121 --> 14:18.790
So this is a little something
from the heart from me to you.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.191
- Aww.
- Um...

14:21.060 --> 14:22.360
- Thank you.
- I give this to you.

14:30.402 --> 14:32.103
Okay.

14:32.105 --> 14:35.173
- [Mindy] Oh, my God!
- Oh, my gosh!

14:37.610 --> 14:40.144
- It needs something.
- It needs something, yeah.

14:40.146 --> 14:43.414
- In the waist or...
- And lose the straps.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.716
So a whole new dress basically.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.184
A whole new dress.

14:46.952 --> 14:49.888
- What do you think my reaction's gonna be?
- I think you're gonna like it.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.257
Hi, girls, are you ready
for your bride?

15:04.303 --> 15:05.703
- Thank you.
- I give this to you.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.972
What's this for?

15:07.974 --> 15:11.409
You have inspired me
all throughout the years.

15:11.411 --> 15:15.980
And you inspired my career.
And I'm just so grateful.

15:17.716 --> 15:19.083
Okay.

15:20.152 --> 15:22.253
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my gosh!

15:22.421 --> 15:23.554
Chewy?

15:23.556 --> 15:26.124
- Oh, my God, you did this?
- I did.

15:26.126 --> 15:29.227
So, I am also a
pet portrait artist.

15:30.996 --> 15:32.964
And I had to do it.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.833
This is absolute perfection.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.468
Really, honestly, thank you.
Seriously,

15:37.470 --> 15:39.804
Of course.
No, thank you, really.

15:39.806 --> 15:44.042
That is my goal, is to help
people feel better and inspire them.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.376
<i>Just to hear that...</i>

15:46.512 --> 15:47.912
It's very touching.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.681
I remember this photograph,
I took it at an airport.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.716
<i>He was in a little red chair.</i>

15:51.718 --> 15:55.420
Okay, do you need to go shopping
for more dress? Let's get that Lazaro.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.922
I think let's put the Lazaro in
the room just to have it here.

15:57.924 --> 16:00.992
- I do have one, there's this Pronovias.
- Okay.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.094
The style name is Saint.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.896
- Yes, I have Saint as well.
- Okay.

16:04.898 --> 16:05.730
[Mindy] Fantastic!

16:05.732 --> 16:07.832
- Why don't I get that?
- Okay.

16:07.834 --> 16:11.135
- And which one of these do you wanna start with?
- Beyoncé.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.938
- [Mindy] Great.
- Okay, good luck, ladies!

16:13.940 --> 16:14.939
[Kimberly] Oh, my gosh!

16:15.541 --> 16:18.042
So beautiful!

16:18.044 --> 16:22.747
There is one Randy dress that is so special
to me, it's called the Beyoncé dress.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.416
And the embellishment
is so beautiful.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.785
I have high hopes
for that dress.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.020
I do.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.359
- First dress!
- Oh, my God.

16:35.961 --> 16:38.663
- Let me get those straps for you.
- I won't scream.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.665
- You can, it's okay.
- Oh, my God.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.868
It's exactly what I expected
and more.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.771
I mean, look at your waist
first of all.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.573
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.209
Yes, ma'am.

16:51.211 --> 16:55.146
Full circle, everything feels
complete with the Beyoncé dress on.

16:55.848 --> 16:56.247
Hey, ladies.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.648
[both] Hi.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.718
So have you seen... You obviously
saw the drawing she did of Chewy.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.521
She took her time on it,
so I'm so happy you liked it.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.656
My everything.
Chewy's my whole world.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.658
He's the most important
thing in my world.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.028
[Mindy]
Are you guys ready for this?

17:10.763 --> 17:13.031
[Rachel] She looks incredible!

17:15.367 --> 17:17.035
- Look at her walk out with that.
- Beautiful.

17:17.037 --> 17:20.405
The confidence, right?

17:20.407 --> 17:23.107
Oh, my God. You're a genius!

17:23.909 --> 17:25.443
You're a genius, too.

17:26.011 --> 17:26.878
How do you feel?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.312
Oh, my God!

17:28.314 --> 17:31.916
This dress... I said it in there,
I'm like, "This dress is divine."

17:31.918 --> 17:36.687
Kim you look stunning, like I
just love this detail and your body.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.390
It's like a beautiful
hour glass shape.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.092
- I mean...
- [Rachel] Unbelievable.

17:41.094 --> 17:44.862
Very sexy because the lace and
the flowers, it's kinda sweet.

17:44.864 --> 17:47.298
Then you've got this
really sexy plunge.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.866
Is there anything you
don't like about this?

17:48.868 --> 17:50.234
Um...

17:52.237 --> 17:55.406
I wish it had
a little more structure.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.675
Which I get, a lot of brides like
to be comfortable, they like to do...

17:57.677 --> 18:01.813
I don't mind being sucked in,
corseted and all that.

18:01.815 --> 18:04.982
[Randy] We can always put some
more in-- alterations if you want.

18:04.984 --> 18:06.384
Let's sway it around, shall we?

18:06.386 --> 18:08.252
Yes. I feel magical.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.388
Okay. Like you dropped out
of the heavens.

18:10.656 --> 18:12.723
Exactly.

18:12.725 --> 18:16.961
- That was a strong start, I feel like...
- That was a very strong start.

18:23.602 --> 18:27.705
We came back here specifically
to try on this simple chic

18:27.707 --> 18:30.074
whatever dress that
you guys wanted,

18:30.076 --> 18:32.743
and now you're sitting here
saying that you don't like it,

18:32.745 --> 18:34.245
so what are we doing here?

18:37.015 --> 18:39.851
I mean, I feel bad.
I know she picked it for me

18:39.853 --> 18:43.454
<i>and I know I was really pushing
the simple and the classic but</i>

18:43.456 --> 18:44.689
I might have been wrong.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.024
- I know it's crazy to say but I might...
- You?

18:47.026 --> 18:48.826
I know, I know, I know but...

18:48.828 --> 18:50.595
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I know.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.664
[Candace]
We love the strapless.

18:53.666 --> 18:57.001
Do we all agree that
strapless may be it?

18:57.003 --> 19:00.071
I would be willing to see
a sweetheart.

19:00.073 --> 19:02.473
- Now that I see this.
- [Lisette] Thank you for trying it on, though,

19:02.475 --> 19:03.407
I love seeing you in it.

19:03.409 --> 19:05.977
- You are most welcome.
- Thank you so much.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.980
And now we can take it off and
throw it back in the dressing room.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.716
- Next, next, on to the next.
- Perfect, all right.

19:11.718 --> 19:12.817
She looks like
a little cake top.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.319
- Aww.
- Okay, ladies, ta-ta.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.256
I put this dress on to appease
my sister and my mother but

19:18.258 --> 19:22.360
also to kinda give me an idea
of just what else is out there.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.828
All right.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.098
But I think it's time for me to start
taking control of this appointment.

19:27.733 --> 19:30.535
I am gravitating more
towards this one.

19:30.537 --> 19:34.071
<i>Glitter, diamonds, flowers.</i>

19:34.073 --> 19:37.108
Just more pretty and sparkly and
that's where I wanna go next with this.

19:38.744 --> 19:39.877
This is so pretty!

19:39.879 --> 19:41.512
[Candace] So this is
more of like a trumpet.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.848
What is the difference
between mermaid and trumpet?

19:43.850 --> 19:45.816
- So this comes like higher like right above the...
- Okay.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.351
Right at the hip.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.654
And the mermaid is more
like right above your knee.

19:49.656 --> 19:55.126
I love the flowers, I love
the sparkle. I love it all.

19:55.128 --> 19:59.397
I'm feeling beautiful. I'm feel confident
and I'm just feeling more like myself.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.934
[Lisette]
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

20:02.936 --> 20:05.102
- We're waiting for the wow.
- I know.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.409
[Elaina] Oh, no smiles.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.277
No smiles.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.282
[Candace]
All right, what do we think?

20:20.953 --> 20:22.320
Well, I know what I think,
what do you think?

20:23.388 --> 20:24.855
Ooh.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.892
Oh, my gosh, well, I
love it, I think it's beautiful.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.962
I think that it is everything that
I told you guys that I wanted.

20:30.964 --> 20:33.798
<i>It's just-- it's very shiny
and glitzy and glamy so</i>

20:33.800 --> 20:37.368
<i>I love this.
I think it's beautiful.</i>

20:39.271 --> 20:42.139
I want some wedding cake with
whipped cream when I look at it.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.207
What?

20:43.209 --> 20:44.308
It's just...

20:44.476 --> 20:45.743
Mom!

20:45.745 --> 20:47.612
- I... What is all this?
- Is that a good thing?

20:47.614 --> 20:48.779
No! What is all this?

20:48.781 --> 20:52.016
[Lisette] The only thing
that we pretty much got right

20:52.018 --> 20:56.887
is the neck line, which even this
little meshy thing I'm not in love with.

20:56.889 --> 21:00.658
- This nude washes you out.
- Yeah, that's what--

21:00.660 --> 21:02.293
That's what it is, Mom!
Yeah.

21:03.295 --> 21:06.597
This one's gonna be
a no from me.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.833
<i>And I feel like you're not
either. Like, I feel like you like it,</i>

21:08.835 --> 21:10.901
but I'm not getting
that glow from you.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.371
- Like I'm looking for a little glow.
- Okay...

21:13.373 --> 21:17.041
And this is giving me more
washed-out than glow.

21:17.043 --> 21:21.145
<i>Again, it's like flashing back to
Kleinfeld's part one, it's a nightmare.</i>

21:21.147 --> 21:25.216
This is my dress,
this is not a "we" situation.

21:25.218 --> 21:26.584
I think I know what I want,

21:26.586 --> 21:29.520
and I need for you guys to trust
me and my gut in this process.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.988
[Jill] I know you know
what you want.

21:30.990 --> 21:34.425
- But we are literally here looking at you.
- Yep.

21:34.593 --> 21:37.528
I don't...
I don't see it.

21:37.530 --> 21:40.464
- Let's try one more time.
- [Lisette] Yeah. And we want you to be happy.

21:40.466 --> 21:44.669
I kinda feel badly, I don't wanna
crush her dreams or crush her spirit.

21:44.671 --> 21:49.006
<i>But until she has that glow,
that look of confidence</i>

21:49.008 --> 21:52.843
that I know is within her, I've
gotta be honest and tell her.

21:52.878 --> 21:55.279
We love the train.

21:55.281 --> 21:56.647
<i>As I'm walking back to the
dressing room,</i>

21:56.649 --> 21:59.750
I just have this moment of clarity,
and I say, "You know what"...

21:59.752 --> 22:02.753
Candace, I think we should go
back to the dress from last time.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.755
- I know it's a Hail Mary...
- Really.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.190
I know, I know.

22:06.192 --> 22:07.892
Something about that
second dress

22:07.894 --> 22:10.361
<i>just reminded me of the dress
that I tried on earlier,</i>

22:10.363 --> 22:12.997
and I cannot get it out
of my head.

22:12.999 --> 22:17.702
I miss it. I just wanna put it on
one more time just to see how I feel.

22:17.704 --> 22:18.736
It's time for me to
put it on again.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.471
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

22:20.473 --> 22:23.641
- Okay, let's do it.
- Let's do it, okay. Let's go. Let's go.

22:23.643 --> 22:27.345
I would not put this on the
same level as the Beyoncé one.

22:27.879 --> 22:29.947
There's no bling
and it's just not Kim.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.316
- This is not...
- I don't know I like it.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.293
I feel absolutely gorgeous.

22:43.395 --> 22:45.496
All right.

22:45.498 --> 22:50.468
I'm so happy that we at least
have, like, a new number one for you.

22:50.470 --> 22:53.738
I'm really excited. I know Randy's
also trying to find the other ones,

22:53.740 --> 22:56.841
just so we can make sure
that we really love it.

22:56.843 --> 23:00.077
Okay, Lazaro, Lazaro, Lazaro.

23:00.312 --> 23:02.580
Lazaro!

23:02.582 --> 23:06.617
There is this Lazaro dress
that I tried on at another store.

23:06.619 --> 23:10.154
There we go.
And now I need Pronovias.

23:11.990 --> 23:15.893
And there is a very particular
Pronovias dress.

23:15.895 --> 23:19.430
And it's very different than what I expecting
to like, but I'm gonna give it a try.

23:20.665 --> 23:23.167
I don't think I'm gonna
like this on her.

23:24.269 --> 23:28.038
I'm not gonna like this on her.
Okay, let's see if she likes it.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.774
Okay.

23:29.776 --> 23:32.209
- May I come in?
- Yeah! Come on in, Randy.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.978
- Hi.
- So I have your two dresses.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.413
Fantastic!

23:35.981 --> 23:37.681
This is one of your favorites.

23:37.683 --> 23:40.718
- Yeah.
- That one's just kinda understated.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.886
[Kimberly]
Yeah, I like this shape.

23:41.888 --> 23:44.755
- Okay, have fun, ladies.
- Thanks, Randy.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.725
I love the idea of
wearing a Randy dress.

23:47.727 --> 23:52.196
But I know that I can't be tied
down to any one type of idea.

23:53.465 --> 23:57.034
I also really love this.
Oh, my God.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.970
- That is also a great reaction.
- This is so hard. Why!

23:59.972 --> 24:04.375
No, I know why, oh, my...
Oh, my God, okay. Wow!

24:05.243 --> 24:07.611
This is the shape.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.380
And I feel held in.

24:10.248 --> 24:12.650
Keep it together.
There's no crying in fashion.

24:12.652 --> 24:16.954
I think a lot of brides come in thinking
that they want one specific thing,

24:16.956 --> 24:18.989
<i>and they end up actually
gravitating towards</i>

24:18.991 --> 24:22.827
<i>that other thing because
it's new, it's fresh.</i>

24:22.829 --> 24:24.261
This could be the winner.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.697
- All right.
- [gasps] Wow!

24:26.699 --> 24:28.265
We've got the Pronovias.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.404
This is the Saint dress.

24:33.406 --> 24:34.939
[Rachel] Oh, wow!

24:35.974 --> 24:39.043
<i>I love the layers,
I love that it crisscrosses.</i>

24:39.045 --> 24:40.578
<i>[Randy] Oh, how we doing?</i>

24:40.580 --> 24:42.580
I really love it.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.915
- You know, you actually look beautiful in this.
- Thank you.

24:44.917 --> 24:48.085
But there's no beads
and there's no lace.

24:48.087 --> 24:51.121
Yeah, it's missing pizzazz.

24:51.389 --> 24:52.857
But I love the shape.

24:52.859 --> 24:56.327
I would not put this on the
same level as the Beyoncé one.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.964
There's no bling and
it's just not Kim.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.833
<i>- This is not saying Kim.
- [Kimberly] I don't know, I like it.</i>

25:02.835 --> 25:04.735
<i>I feel like I'm being
held in well.</i>

25:04.737 --> 25:07.805
Um, this ruching
detail's subtle.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.106
But it's still very pretty.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.742
Like, is that what you love?

25:11.744 --> 25:13.477
Like, you love like
the shape but like also--

25:13.479 --> 25:16.881
I really like this dress.
I mean, it's a tie.

25:16.883 --> 25:20.784
- Oh, wow. Okay.
- [Mindy] We were borderline almost tears.

25:20.786 --> 25:21.685
- On this one?
- Yeah.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.587
Yeah. Girl!

25:23.589 --> 25:27.157
Yeah, I mean I understand
why she likes this dress.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.693
<i>It's a beautiful dress and
I don't know if she's getting</i>

25:29.695 --> 25:31.695
<i>too caught up in designer mode,</i>

25:31.697 --> 25:34.598
<i>but she's not thinking
about herself</i>

25:34.600 --> 25:36.867
and how she wants to feel
on her wedding day.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.069
Am I straying far away
from myself?

25:39.237 --> 25:40.671
- Kind of.
- Yeah.

25:40.673 --> 25:43.207
I mean, you came in
wearing ostrich feathers.

25:44.809 --> 25:46.577
If you feel more beautiful
in this than that.

25:46.579 --> 25:47.811
That's what you have to go with.

25:47.813 --> 25:49.647
Which dress do you
feel the most beautiful in?

25:49.649 --> 25:51.749
I can't answer that just yet.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.150
[Randy] So now to the Lazaro?

25:53.251 --> 25:55.819
- Um, yes.
- Okay.

25:55.821 --> 26:00.090
Probably our biggest challenge in this
appointment with Kim is the fact that she's...

26:00.725 --> 26:04.028
<i>still torn between
two different silhouettes.</i>

26:04.030 --> 26:07.898
A ball gown and
a mermaid silhouette.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.834
And if you don't love the Lazaro,
then I wouldn't come out in it.

26:10.869 --> 26:11.869
Okay.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.073
I don't know where
we are in this appointment.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.013
Ah, here it is.

26:24.482 --> 26:27.685
I came here a couple of months
ago with my mom and sister.

26:27.687 --> 26:31.789
I found something that I love but it
was shot down very quickly by them.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.791
They said that it was
kinda outdated.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.426
I don't even know
what that means.

26:35.428 --> 26:37.795
Come on concealer
don't fail me now.

26:37.797 --> 26:40.864
- It's not.
- Girl!

26:40.866 --> 26:42.733
Man, it's been intense
out there.

26:42.735 --> 26:49.173
I feel like she is trying to put her
family first and her feelings last.

26:50.408 --> 26:52.443
- It is here!
- Oh, my gosh!

26:53.178 --> 26:55.412
We need to put
her feelings first

26:55.414 --> 26:57.982
and add her family to that mix.

26:58.984 --> 27:00.384
Oh, my God!

27:00.885 --> 27:02.953
Oh, my God!

27:03.321 --> 27:05.856
Oh, I'm getting emotional.

27:05.858 --> 27:09.760
I just wanna cry, all of the
feelings came right back to me.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.462
<i>I love it!</i>

27:11.464 --> 27:13.631
<i>It's everything that
I remembered it being,</i>

27:13.633 --> 27:15.532
and, like, my heart is just
so happy right now.

27:15.534 --> 27:18.535
This was my dress then and
this will be my dress today.

27:18.537 --> 27:20.170
This is it.
I don't care what they say.

27:20.172 --> 27:23.874
[shushes] Stop it. Enough.
This is it. We're done.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.209
This is it.

27:27.946 --> 27:30.447
Hopefully, third time's a charm.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.218
We'll see.

27:35.954 --> 27:37.955
[screaming in excitement]

27:38.823 --> 27:41.058
You guys...

27:43.762 --> 27:46.263
Oh, my God.
I can't stop smiling.

27:49.934 --> 27:51.168
[Lisette] I mean...

27:51.870 --> 27:54.071
It's-- You know what?

27:56.841 --> 27:58.709
I love how it has...

27:58.711 --> 28:00.477
<i>the different tone in nude.</i>

28:00.479 --> 28:02.813
<i>The different tone in nude
is definitely nicer.</i>

28:02.815 --> 28:04.815
<i>[Elaina] I'm sorry,
did you say that you loved it?</i>

28:04.817 --> 28:06.884
<i>[Lisette] I actually love
the bottom lace.</i>

28:06.886 --> 28:08.986
<i>I love the little sleeve on it.</i>

28:08.988 --> 28:10.988
- And you know...
- [voice breaking] Oh, my God.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.122
She's just really glowing.

28:12.124 --> 28:13.657
Is this the same one
that you had last time?

28:13.659 --> 28:15.659
Oh, you're being so nice.

28:15.661 --> 28:17.895
- [Candace] It is the same one that she had the last time.
- Is it really?

28:17.897 --> 28:20.664
- Oh, my God!
- It's the dress! It's the dress!

28:20.666 --> 28:21.832
<i>[Lisette] Oh, my God.
I don't know.</i>

28:21.834 --> 28:24.334
<i>Something about it
looks different this time.</i>

28:25.070 --> 28:27.504
I think it's your confidence,
sweetheart.

28:27.506 --> 28:28.706
[Lisette] Yeah, I agree.

28:28.708 --> 28:31.108
This is the same dress
that you had on before.

28:31.110 --> 28:34.411
- You did not have this assuredness.
- [Lisette] No.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.914
<i>[Elaina] I think that it's just
me seeing it this time around.</i>

28:36.916 --> 28:37.881
<i>I have a different perspective.</i>

28:37.883 --> 28:39.650
I was wearing a mask

28:39.652 --> 28:40.818
and I think this is my
first time... [sniffles]

28:40.820 --> 28:42.386
<i>Seeing myself in a dress.</i>

28:42.388 --> 28:44.755
Yeah. Oh, stop.
I'm gonna cry. Don't cry.

28:44.757 --> 28:45.889
What do you think, Mom?

28:45.891 --> 28:48.092
- I think she's glowing.
- [Elaina sniffles]

28:48.094 --> 28:50.561
I don't want to ugly cry
but I can't help it

28:50.563 --> 28:53.630
because I'm so happy inside.

28:53.632 --> 28:56.033
The only thing I'm a little
worried about though is

28:56.035 --> 28:57.835
it's so much detail that like...

28:57.837 --> 29:00.037
will a veil be too much?

29:00.039 --> 29:01.705
Would you even be able
to pull that off

29:01.707 --> 29:04.241
- with all of this train, too?
- [Candace] Oh. Absolutely.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.576
I don't know, Candace.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.144
- I don't know. We'll try.
- Let me get the veil.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.345
- We can try.
- We'll give it a try.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.780
[Jill] Okay.

29:09.782 --> 29:13.951
<i>[Elaina] I don't know what
Kleinfeld spell came over Lisette,</i>

29:13.953 --> 29:17.421
I just feel like a huge weight
has been lifted off my shoulders.

29:18.656 --> 29:20.691
Oh, it's so pretty.

29:20.693 --> 29:23.327
- [Candace] It's simple and pretty.
- She's our little bride.

29:24.929 --> 29:27.731
- I know.
- Oh, Mom, you're crying.

29:27.733 --> 29:28.799
[Lisette] Don't cry, Mom.

29:28.801 --> 29:30.701
[Elaina exclaiming]
Oh, Mom.

29:30.703 --> 29:33.604
- [Lisette] I know. It's all coming together.
- It's beautiful.

29:33.606 --> 29:37.007
[Jill] It's everything I think
you ever dreamed of

29:37.009 --> 29:39.276
and it's more than
I ever dreamed of.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.311
You're so beautiful.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.347
Okay.

29:43.915 --> 29:45.415
Oh, my God!

29:48.653 --> 29:50.888
100% this is it.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.390
- I'm gonna cry! I ain't gonna cry.
- [all cheering]

29:53.392 --> 29:54.892
I don't wanna
mess up my make-up.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.593
You guys, this is it.

29:56.595 --> 29:58.762
Can I ask you the question?

29:58.764 --> 30:02.232
- Oh, wait. The question. The question!
- Ask me the question!

30:03.635 --> 30:04.968
[Candace] Elaina...

30:06.070 --> 30:08.038
are you saying yes to the dress?

30:09.908 --> 30:11.375
[screams] Yes!

30:12.944 --> 30:14.812
[Jill]
It looks beautiful!

30:14.814 --> 30:17.981
[Lisette]
We love it so much.

30:17.983 --> 30:20.083
- [Jill] You look so beautiful!
- So pretty.

30:20.085 --> 30:22.986
<i>[Elaina] This day is something that
I've dreamed of since I was a little girl.</i>

30:22.988 --> 30:23.887
I feel like a bride.

30:23.889 --> 30:26.056
I feel important,
I feel special,

30:26.058 --> 30:28.125
and I couldn't have asked
for anything more.

30:28.127 --> 30:30.761
We're leaving here in a
completely different place,

30:30.763 --> 30:31.929
and I am excited.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.230
We're leaving here with a dress.

30:33.232 --> 30:35.799
We are leaving here
with a dress!

30:35.801 --> 30:37.601
[all cheering]

30:37.603 --> 30:39.036
She said yes.

30:39.038 --> 30:41.538
<i>[Lisette] I am glad we were all
able to come to an agreement.</i>

30:41.540 --> 30:42.840
<i>She's happy.
We're happy</i>

30:42.842 --> 30:44.641
<i>- that she's happy.
- [Elaina] We're all happy.</i>

30:44.643 --> 30:47.578
- We're all so happy.
- All happy.

30:47.580 --> 30:48.946
And I knew,
at the end of the day,

30:48.948 --> 30:51.014
my choice would've been
right for you.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.183
My choice is the right choice.

30:56.754 --> 30:58.222
[Kimberly] Oh, no.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.657
The look of disappointment
on you guys.

31:00.659 --> 31:02.125
Oh, my God.

31:10.935 --> 31:13.804
So excited.
Mom gets to see my dress.

31:13.806 --> 31:15.105
- Can't wait.
- [Morgan giggles]

31:15.907 --> 31:18.108
Is that a real smile
or a fake smile?

31:18.776 --> 31:20.010
A real smile.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.014
I love that dress.
It's so pretty.

31:24.016 --> 31:24.681
So, so pretty.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.950
I grew up doing pageants,

31:26.952 --> 31:31.054
so I have this soft spot for like
very fancy dresses and stuff so...

31:31.056 --> 31:34.057
I of course had to come here
for the big day to find my dress,

31:34.059 --> 31:37.561
<i>but unfortunately, my mom
had to tune in over FaceTime</i>

31:37.563 --> 31:38.962
because of COVID.

31:38.964 --> 31:41.798
Now, since she is here
for my dress fitting

31:41.800 --> 31:43.500
I am so excited but also nervous

31:43.502 --> 31:44.902
for her to see it in person.

31:44.904 --> 31:47.804
'Cause I don't think it's what
she envisioned me in.

31:47.806 --> 31:49.740
It's like a pageant gown
on steroids.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.541
- Yeah.
- [Teresa laughing]

31:51.543 --> 31:53.577
I guess I was thinking
she was gonna be doing

31:53.579 --> 31:56.914
something that would be
a little bit less conservative.

31:56.916 --> 31:59.149
<i>But then when she chose
that one so quick, I was like,</i>

31:59.151 --> 32:01.318
<i>"Oh, wow. Okay."</i>

32:01.586 --> 32:03.987
Hi. Good morning, girls.

32:03.989 --> 32:06.857
My name is Lorena. I'm
gonna be your fitter today.

32:06.859 --> 32:07.925
- You girls ready?
- [Morgan] Yeah.

32:07.927 --> 32:09.593
- You can follow me.
- Awesome.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.962
[Morgan] <i>I think she
was just caught off guard</i>

32:11.964 --> 32:13.630
but it's definitely hard
not to have doubts.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.832
<i>It's been 10 months, I guess.</i>

32:15.834 --> 32:17.534
I'm like, "Did I choose
the right one? Is this right?"

32:17.536 --> 32:20.203
[Lorena] So, mom and
sister can sit right here.

32:20.205 --> 32:22.839
- We are gonna surprise you in a second.
- [Morgan] Yay!

32:22.841 --> 32:24.508
<i>[Teresa] I really just want
her to be happy</i>

32:24.510 --> 32:26.076
<i>and comfortable at the wedding.</i>

32:26.078 --> 32:28.578
<i>However, I would like her
to listen to my advice</i>

32:28.580 --> 32:29.980
<i>just a little bit.</i>

32:31.983 --> 32:33.850
Oh, I love him.
We are very close.

32:33.852 --> 32:37.688
I think Darius is just
gonna be blown away.

32:37.690 --> 32:40.757
My fiance and I met
when we were both in college.

32:40.759 --> 32:44.795
<i>He's just great.
Like, so fun, so crazy.</i>

32:44.797 --> 32:46.830
<i>He definitely gets me
out of my comfort zone.</i>

32:46.832 --> 32:49.566
We got engaged
last March in Paris.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.068
<i>We're taking pictures and stuff,</i>

32:51.070 --> 32:52.970
<i>and then all of a sudden,
he's on one knee.</i>

32:52.972 --> 32:53.937
I was like,
"Oh, my gosh."

32:53.939 --> 32:56.940
<i>It was magical to say the least.</i>

33:02.046 --> 33:05.082
- [Lorena] So, this is us.
- Wow.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.183
So...

33:07.151 --> 33:08.986
Ready to try it on?

33:09.387 --> 33:11.021
Yeah.

33:12.757 --> 33:13.757
What do you think
my reaction's gonna be?

33:13.759 --> 33:15.993
I think you're gonna like it.

33:15.995 --> 33:18.395
- Can you out your hands on your waist for me, please?
- Yeah.

33:18.397 --> 33:19.363
Thank you.

33:20.498 --> 33:21.832
It feels good, yeah.

33:21.866 --> 33:25.135
[Morgan] <i>I'm hoping she loves
it but we are about to find out.</i>

33:26.070 --> 33:27.871
Hi, girls.
Are you ready for your bride?

33:27.873 --> 33:29.206
We are.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.015
Do you want this one, buddy?

33:38.017 --> 33:38.682
Hey, buddy?

33:38.684 --> 33:40.117
Get it!

33:40.685 --> 33:42.719
[Mindy]
Should we try the Lazaro?

33:42.721 --> 33:44.788
- Yeah, I think I need to see the ball gown.
- Okay, let's do it.

33:44.790 --> 33:48.658
There is a dress that I
tried on at another store

33:48.660 --> 33:51.995
<i>that I wanted to try on again
to eliminate it,</i>

33:51.997 --> 33:53.764
so I can move on
with the Pronovias

33:53.766 --> 33:55.098
or the Beyoncé dress.

33:55.967 --> 33:57.034
- [sighs] Okay.
- Wow.

33:57.036 --> 33:58.902
Is it how you remembered?

33:58.904 --> 34:00.404
It is how I remembered, yeah.

34:00.406 --> 34:01.972
So this Lazaro dress,

34:01.974 --> 34:04.107
I love it just as much as I did.

34:04.109 --> 34:05.308
Maybe even more.

34:05.543 --> 34:06.777
Gorgeous.

34:06.779 --> 34:10.814
But now I am thinking about
the Beyoncé dress. [chuckles]

34:10.816 --> 34:15.018
<i>I think I can take
the Lazaro out of my life.</i>

34:15.753 --> 34:17.421
I'm gonna pout.

34:17.423 --> 34:19.056
<i>If you're thinking about
another dress</i>

34:19.058 --> 34:20.290
<i>when you have
a different one on...</i>

34:20.691 --> 34:22.225
that's not it.

34:24.162 --> 34:27.197
- [Mindy] We have Beyoncé back on.
- [Kimberly] Oh, geez Louise.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.368
[grunts] This is hard.

34:31.836 --> 34:34.137
Okay.

34:35.640 --> 34:38.575
Um, I was expecting a little
more drama in the shape

34:38.577 --> 34:41.812
maybe, uh, and that's why I'm
getting pulled back to the other one.

34:41.814 --> 34:44.214
- Hmm.
- But this has everything else.

34:45.016 --> 34:46.249
I mean, this is...

34:47.652 --> 34:48.985
[sighs]

34:49.053 --> 34:51.755
Such a beautiful dress-- you
know, We'll try on the Pronovias.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.423
I really love to come here,

34:53.425 --> 34:57.127
<i>have a full circle moment,
you know, have</i>

34:57.129 --> 35:00.163
<i>a career inspired by Randy,
then wear a dress by Randy.</i>

35:01.833 --> 35:03.400
[groaning]

35:03.402 --> 35:06.770
I'm looking for that aha moment.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.805
- Hi. How's it going?
- Hi.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.340
It's going.

35:10.342 --> 35:13.677
<i>[Mindy] Um, I think
she is incredibly torn,</i>

35:13.679 --> 35:17.314
<i>and I think it's an
emotional decision because</i>

35:17.316 --> 35:20.951
I think she wants, more than
anything, to wear your dress.

35:20.953 --> 35:23.920
I don't know, is my gut wrong? Is
my head wrong? Is my heart wrong?

35:23.922 --> 35:25.322
One of them is wrong.
[laughs]

35:26.124 --> 35:26.857
[knocking at door]

35:26.859 --> 35:28.191
Yes?

35:29.927 --> 35:31.561
- Hi, gorgeous.
- Hello there.

35:31.563 --> 35:32.963
You love this, don't you?

35:32.965 --> 35:36.800
- I do really like this.
- Well, then, let that dress go.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.902
But, your dresses
are so beautiful,

35:38.904 --> 35:41.671
- it's hard to like...
- [Randy] It doesn't matter.

35:41.673 --> 35:42.906
- I only want one thing.
- [Kimberly] Hmm.

35:42.908 --> 35:44.040
For you to have the dress

35:44.042 --> 35:45.742
- that you feel the most beautiful in.
- Yeah.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.711
I don't care whose dress it is.

35:47.713 --> 35:51.014
Little disappointing that they
didn't love it as much as I loved it.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.984
I wanna say yes
and pop champagne.

35:55.019 --> 35:57.220
It's not what
they were expecting,

35:57.222 --> 35:58.788
'cause I came in, and I wanted

35:58.790 --> 35:59.890
every embellishment

35:59.892 --> 36:02.692
known to man, but I don't know.

36:02.694 --> 36:05.228
Yeah, you do. Choose
the dress that you want.

36:05.563 --> 36:07.030
I think I what should I do.

36:07.032 --> 36:09.699
Oh, no. I have a feeling
about this next one.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.768
It might be the same Lazaro one,

36:11.770 --> 36:13.270
unless they found
a different one.

36:13.804 --> 36:16.773
[dramatic music playing]

36:16.775 --> 36:19.242
[Kimberly] Oh, no!

36:19.744 --> 36:23.013
The look of disappointment
on you guys.

36:25.983 --> 36:28.752
- No way.
- I was able to eliminate the Lazaro.

36:28.754 --> 36:30.053
What?

36:30.055 --> 36:30.921
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

36:30.923 --> 36:34.157
- How we feeling?
- Even more confused.

36:34.159 --> 36:35.926
Well, I did have
the Beyoncé dress on,

36:35.928 --> 36:38.261
and then I thought about
this one, and I put this one on,

36:38.263 --> 36:39.196
and I thought about the
Beyoncé dress,

36:39.198 --> 36:41.431
and then it was just
a tug of war with myself.

36:41.433 --> 36:44.768
- It's the battle of her head and her heart.
- [Randy] Yeah.

36:44.770 --> 36:47.037
So, do you feel like
you need just

36:47.039 --> 36:48.872
- time to step away and think about it?
- I... yeah.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.941
I think so, too.

36:55.780 --> 36:57.647
Really had my heart set
on like...

36:57.649 --> 36:59.616
saying yes today, but...

36:59.618 --> 37:01.885
I don't know.
How do you pick a dress,

37:01.887 --> 37:04.621
when they both
give you the same feeling?

37:04.623 --> 37:06.923
Maybe I'll feel
differently tomorrow.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.625
Maybe I'll feel
differently next week.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.961
Um, I think time will tell.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.164
Aww, thank you for everything.
Thank you, too.

37:14.166 --> 37:15.131
Our pleasure.

37:15.133 --> 37:19.035
[all exclaiming]

37:19.037 --> 37:21.471
Kisses, kisses, kisses.
Oh, there you go.

37:21.473 --> 37:24.341
Oh, you're a cutie!

37:24.343 --> 37:27.410
<i>[Morgan] I'm so excited
about getting into my dress.</i>

37:27.412 --> 37:31.214
It's crazy that the day is
finally here to actually wear it.

37:31.716 --> 37:34.217
Three, two, one.

37:35.019 --> 37:37.187
[all exclaiming] Aww!

37:42.793 --> 37:45.862
This is gonna be the new
sport in the Summer Olympics.

37:45.864 --> 37:48.431
- What are you doing?
- Rack and roll. Watch.

37:48.433 --> 37:49.933
Rack, roll.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.702
- Wait, wait, you're caught.
- I can get out.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.404
- It's called... I got it.
- [shouting]

37:54.406 --> 37:57.841
Working with brides today
has absolutely

37:57.843 --> 38:01.878
been the most incredible
thing I have done all year long.

38:01.912 --> 38:05.415
[laughing]

38:05.417 --> 38:07.384
I can even
parallel park these now.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.786
I do not miss my computer screen

38:09.788 --> 38:10.720
at all.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.856
And if it feels this good now,

38:12.858 --> 38:15.358
I can't wait to see
what the future holds.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.295
There you go, and done.

38:19.430 --> 38:22.365
[suspenseful music playing]

38:24.101 --> 38:26.036
Hi, girls. Are you ready
for your bride?

38:26.038 --> 38:27.003
Yes.

38:27.005 --> 38:30.140
My mom's opinion is like
the most important to me.

38:30.142 --> 38:34.210
If my mom doesn't like it,
I'm gonna be a little upset.

38:35.746 --> 38:38.615
- Aww!
- So pretty!

38:38.617 --> 38:40.517
- So pretty, right?
- Yes.

38:40.519 --> 38:44.788
- Wow!
- So pretty. You look like a princess.

38:44.790 --> 38:48.858
- It like fits perfect. Isn't that crazy?
- Yeah, it really does.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.894
Absolutely better
than I imagined.

38:50.896 --> 38:52.295
Absolutely.

38:55.466 --> 38:57.767
Yeah, you need the belt, right?

38:57.769 --> 39:00.337
Being able to see it in person,
now I can see why you chose this

39:00.339 --> 39:01.805
so quickly.
I mean, it's beautiful.

39:01.807 --> 39:05.675
<i>[Morgan] I'm just like so happy
to see her reaction. I can tell,</i>

39:05.677 --> 39:09.179
<i>in that moment, she is just like,
"Okay, I get it, I love this dress,</i>

39:09.181 --> 39:12.282
it is so perfect, and you
made a great choice."

39:12.284 --> 39:15.652
<i>And I like the detailing, too. It's just
like better than I remembered it looking,</i>

39:15.654 --> 39:18.421
<i>which is also good, because I
haven't seen it in like nine months.</i>

39:19.790 --> 39:23.026
<i>No more second guessing
at all. This is my dress,</i>

39:23.028 --> 39:24.894
<i>and I look amazing in it.</i>

39:24.896 --> 39:27.364
Are you going to have a
first look, with your fiance?

39:27.366 --> 39:28.865
No, I'm not.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.568
- You're gonna wait until...
- That's the one traditional thing, I think,

39:31.570 --> 39:35.038
I wanted to keep. It's kinda
like one of the fun parts is...

39:35.040 --> 39:37.707
waiting for him to see me walk
down the aisle, I don't know.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.976
Our venue is insane.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.812
<i>It's like a renovated church
in Wilmington, North Carolina,</i>

39:42.814 --> 39:44.714
<i>and it's on Juneteenth,</i>

39:44.716 --> 39:46.383
which is also
really important to us,

39:46.385 --> 39:48.918
because we are
like an interracial couple.

39:48.920 --> 39:54.023
So bringing both sides of our family
together is gonna be really fun and special.

39:57.595 --> 40:02.332
[dramatic music playing]

40:02.334 --> 40:05.101
<i>I'm so excited
about getting into my dress.</i>

40:05.103 --> 40:08.972
It's crazy that the day is
finally here to actually wear it.

40:09.006 --> 40:12.075
Three, two, one.

40:12.209 --> 40:15.278
[all exclaiming] Aww!

40:16.881 --> 40:18.782
<i>[Darius] Well, I was
always told, you know,</i>

40:18.784 --> 40:21.985
if you're not nervous,
it means nothing to you.

40:21.987 --> 40:25.054
So I am a little nervous, but I
am more anxious and happy.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.389
I'm just ready to see my baby.

40:26.391 --> 40:29.392
[all cheering]

40:30.761 --> 40:34.097
[captivating instrumental
music playing]

40:57.588 --> 41:00.490
[Darius] Morgan,
you mean so much to me.

41:00.492 --> 41:03.660
[voice shaking] I don't care if it's
four people here or four hundred,

41:03.662 --> 41:06.463
I just want you to know I
love you. You make me better.

41:06.465 --> 41:08.331
You make me wanna take risks.

41:08.333 --> 41:11.968
You make me wanna live better.
You make me wanna break curses.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.337
And with you, that's what
I'm doing, I'm breaking curses.

41:15.172 --> 41:16.439
When you came...

41:17.408 --> 41:18.842
It's all right.

41:22.413 --> 41:24.948
I love you so much,
and that's for a lifetime.

41:24.950 --> 41:28.585
Why did I choose to go
after that? [all laughing]

41:28.587 --> 41:31.387
I don't know,
but I love you so much.

41:31.389 --> 41:34.557
You're everything. You're...
We're officially a family now.

41:34.559 --> 41:36.559
You're my best friend
for ever and ever,

41:36.561 --> 41:40.296
like you said, we're in this
for a lifetime. You're the best.

41:41.765 --> 41:46.102
- Darius, do you take Morgan to be your lawfully wedded wife?
- Oh, I do.

41:46.104 --> 41:49.339
Pledging before God
and these witnesses?

41:49.874 --> 41:51.007
I do.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.809
-With this ring,
-With this ring,

41:52.811 --> 41:54.911
- I thee wed.
- I thee wed.

41:54.913 --> 41:58.114
I now pronounce you are
husband and wife.

41:59.016 --> 42:00.350
Darius, you may kiss your bride.

42:00.352 --> 42:03.152
[all cheering]

42:04.889 --> 42:07.724
When I saw her walk down
the aisle, she looked amazing.

42:07.726 --> 42:10.059
The dress
was absolutely gorgeous.

42:12.696 --> 42:15.331
- It feels crazy to be married.
- Yeah.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.033
<i>[Darius] I'm happy. I'm
speechless. There you go.</i>

42:17.035 --> 42:20.970
- No words. We're super happy.
- No words.

42:20.972 --> 42:24.173
<i>[Morgan] It was the perfect night, and we
were so happy to be with everyone we love.</i>
