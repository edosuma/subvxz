WEBVTT

00:07.675 --> 00:11.176
Why did the alarm horn go
off during our sleepover party?

00:11.278 --> 00:13.078
Someone probably saw our pajamas

00:13.180 --> 00:15.347
and declared a fashion emergency.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.983
Footsie pajamas are awesome,

00:18.085 --> 00:19.451
right, Warwick?

00:19.553 --> 00:21.620
Sorry, bro, I told you
this was gonna happen.

00:23.324 --> 00:26.025
Stupid horn.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.260
Oh, cool pajamas, Arc.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.429
Just kidding. They're dumb.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.198
Well, there's no threat here.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.867
It must be a false alarm.

00:34.969 --> 00:36.602
Do you hear that, scary warrior?

00:36.704 --> 00:38.237
You can go back to bed now.

00:40.574 --> 00:41.907
It's Commander Umbala.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.575
She's Ryker's bloodthirsty enforcer.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.944
How did she get past
the crystal force field?

00:46.047 --> 00:48.447
I'm not sure, but ready your weapons...

00:48.549 --> 00:49.681
Which we forgot.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.887
It's okay. She forgot her weapon, too.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.090
No, she remembered.

00:58.993 --> 00:59.992
Battle formation!

01:04.965 --> 01:05.931
Ahhhhh!

01:12.339 --> 01:14.840
The only way to beat her
is to get rid of her weapon.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.075
Well, that ax of hers

01:16.177 --> 01:17.776
could take out four
people with one swing...

01:17.878 --> 01:19.711
Meaning, Phoenix Squad, you're up.

01:19.814 --> 01:22.281
Don't worry, I got this.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.216
Take thee outie axie-waxie!

01:27.455 --> 01:30.556
Sorry, I axied
when I should have waxied.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.258
Kraken Squad, charge!

01:37.932 --> 01:39.031
I'm gonna use my giant strength

01:39.133 --> 01:40.966
to rip that thing from her hands.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.803
I got it!

01:44.905 --> 01:47.005
Whoa! No, it's got me!

01:47.108 --> 01:48.407
Whoa!

01:50.611 --> 01:51.944
Are you okay?

01:52.046 --> 01:53.212
Yeah.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.180
My body broke the fall.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.282
It's up to us.

01:57.384 --> 01:58.917
We need something
powerful to take her down.

01:59.019 --> 02:00.052
What about the Flying Phoenix Kick

02:00.154 --> 02:01.320
we've been working on?

02:01.422 --> 02:03.255
Every time we try it,
we land on our butts.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.557
Yeah, well, this time she's
gonna land on our butts.

02:08.027 --> 02:09.394
Let's just do the kick.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.572
These are the future knights of Astoria?

02:20.674 --> 02:21.773
Pathetic!

02:21.876 --> 02:23.942
Oh, no, what's she gonna do now?

02:25.279 --> 02:26.345
She's going to stand there

02:26.447 --> 02:29.648
until I turn her back into Sir Gareth.

02:34.421 --> 02:37.890
This was a drill that you all failed!

02:37.992 --> 02:39.191
Leaving your weapons upstairs!

02:39.293 --> 02:40.993
I expect that from Warwick.

02:41.095 --> 02:43.061
Thanks.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.197
Hey!

02:45.299 --> 02:48.634
I don't know what's
the bigger disaster...

02:48.736 --> 02:50.068
Your lack of skills

02:50.171 --> 02:51.904
or your choice of jammies.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.941
Skills! No, no, jammies!

02:56.043 --> 02:57.442
Fault!

03:00.181 --> 03:01.914
Not one of you was prepared

03:02.016 --> 03:03.815
when the kingdom was in danger.

03:03.918 --> 03:07.252
Clearly, you haven't been
taking your training seriously.

03:08.556 --> 03:11.256
Hogancross, poof me away so
I don't have to look at them.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.892
Sure. You can join me
for my hip hop dance class.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.528
I'd rather watch this crusty old wizard

03:16.630 --> 03:18.263
ruin hip hop than look at you.

03:25.072 --> 03:28.941
Wow, we got our butts kicked
so badly in that drill

03:29.043 --> 03:31.276
they're calling it The Pajama Massacre.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.145
Even you, bro?

03:33.247 --> 03:34.279
Well, I held back my bravery

03:34.381 --> 03:36.648
so I wouldn't make
everyone else look bad.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.619
Uh...

03:40.721 --> 03:41.687
what's in the bushes?

03:44.258 --> 03:45.357
What is that thing?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.996
Hello.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.631
Awww...

03:55.402 --> 04:00.072
Look at that little ball of cuteness.

04:00.174 --> 04:02.841
Uh... uh...

04:04.345 --> 04:07.179
Whatever it is, it sure is gooey.

04:10.317 --> 04:12.317
Because he's a slobber puff.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.652
That's the slobber.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.656
And that's the puff.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.125
Oh, he's the grossest thing ever.

04:20.226 --> 04:21.927
And he stinks.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.062
So, we're keepin' him, right?

04:24.164 --> 04:25.931
Definitely!

04:26.033 --> 04:27.699
Awww...

04:30.404 --> 04:33.038
Oh, don't worry about lunch.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.006
It's on me.

04:34.108 --> 04:35.841
Aw. You're offering to pay?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.409
What are you up to?

04:38.712 --> 04:40.646
Getting us free lunch and dessert.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.814
Ow!

04:42.916 --> 04:44.483
Oh, Warlock!

04:44.585 --> 04:47.019
I found this disgusting hair in my food.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.321
We refuse to pay
and demand free dessert.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.393
The customer service here is top notch.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.996
You're gonna regret
this when you go bald.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.400
Don't you wish that on me.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.704
Sorry. I'm still upset
about that Umbala drill.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.774
Our Flying Phoenix Kick
was more like a flying flop.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.877
You know, the real Commander Umbala

05:11.979 --> 05:14.479
led the charge when Ryker's
army attacked my village.

05:14.581 --> 05:17.316
Some day I'm gonna get
my revenge on Ryker.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.985
People have been saying
that for 200 years.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.820
He's been around that long?

05:21.922 --> 05:25.924
He has the inner rage
of a much younger villain.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.392
Why's he such a jerk?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.761
Long ago, Ryker was
actually the King of Astoria.

05:29.863 --> 05:33.732
I know I asked, but I'm
already incredibly bored.

05:33.834 --> 05:38.070
Oh, right, I'd better Arcify this.

05:38.172 --> 05:41.173
So, King Ryker was like totally cray.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.942
He was all like,
I'm evil, do what I say,

05:44.044 --> 05:46.044
blah, blah, blah!

05:46.146 --> 05:47.846
Now this is a story!

05:47.948 --> 05:50.549
The people were like,
you'd better bounce, evil dude,

05:50.651 --> 05:52.784
and he was like,
what are you gonna do...

05:52.886 --> 05:54.353
Banish me?!

05:54.455 --> 05:56.254
Did they banish him?
Tell me they banished him.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.390
- Oh, they banished him.
- Yes!

05:58.492 --> 06:01.226
Love a good banishing!

06:01.328 --> 06:04.329
Ryker vowed to return
to conquer Astoria.

06:04.431 --> 06:06.865
When did you get that banana split?

06:06.967 --> 06:10.135
I found another hair
while you were talking.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.737
Go on.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.939
So, Wizard Hogancross
used the most powerful

06:14.041 --> 06:16.441
crystals in the kingdom
to create a force field.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.478
No way! The dragon blood
crystals, they're real?

06:19.580 --> 06:21.880
Yes, and they're in
the secret crystal room.

06:21.982 --> 06:25.283
- But before you ask...
- Can you take me there?

06:25.386 --> 06:28.320
Come on. I'm your best friend.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.622
Prudy's my best friend.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.891
Hurtful.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.027
Sorry, but taking you
there is too big of a risk.

06:36.130 --> 06:37.362
What?

06:37.464 --> 06:39.664
Okay, how do I say this nicely?

06:39.767 --> 06:42.434
The crystals are really valuable and,

06:42.536 --> 06:45.137
well, you're kinda...

06:45.239 --> 06:48.573
what's the opposite of not a thief?

06:48.675 --> 06:50.375
Is this about me stealing your tiara,

06:50.477 --> 06:52.144
so I could pay for knight school?

06:52.246 --> 06:54.146
What's the opposite of no?

06:54.248 --> 06:55.280
Unbelievable.

06:55.382 --> 06:56.648
After all we've been through,

06:56.750 --> 06:58.083
you really don't trust me.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.952
You just tricked your
way into two free desserts.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.954
Make that three.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.256
You know what?

07:04.358 --> 07:06.591
I'm not gonna sit
here and listen to this.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.527
Good day!

07:08.629 --> 07:10.395
I'll take the rest of my desserts to go.

07:12.065 --> 07:16.101
Once again, the customer
service is top notch.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.578
Hey!

07:30.150 --> 07:31.616
Hey!

07:33.000 --> 07:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:46.366 --> 07:47.632
What's all this?

07:47.734 --> 07:49.468
Well, since you can't get past me

07:49.570 --> 07:50.602
stealing your tiara,

07:50.704 --> 07:51.970
I'm gonna get your money back

07:52.072 --> 07:53.872
by selling all of my most
valuable possessions.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.441
Old boots, a sad jar of buttons,

07:56.543 --> 08:00.545
and a nasty chicken bone?

08:00.647 --> 08:02.714
Actually, it's a nasty turkey bone.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.583
If you hold it up to your ear,

08:04.685 --> 08:06.084
you can hear it gobble.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.955
Arc, I feel bad that
I hurt your feelings.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.723
But you can't blame me
for not trusting you.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.158
Seriously?

08:13.260 --> 08:14.960
All right, when you got
captured by that giant spider

08:15.062 --> 08:17.562
- who cut you out of the web?
- You.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.897
When you were about to drink

08:18.999 --> 08:20.432
that expired Pegasus milk,
who stopped you?

08:20.534 --> 08:21.766
You.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.535
When you fell out of that
tower, who caught you?

08:23.637 --> 08:25.303
- Prudy.
- Oh, yeah.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.608
Well, Prudy isn't the one
keeping your secret.

08:29.710 --> 08:30.909
Okay, you're right.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.477
I trust you with my secret,

08:32.578 --> 08:35.046
so I should be able to trust
you with the crystal room.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.280
Yes!

08:36.383 --> 08:38.950
As a thank you, you can
take any one of my buttons.

08:39.052 --> 08:42.087
Please don't take my buttons.

08:44.958 --> 08:48.260
We'd like everyone to meet Slobwick.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.531
He seems more like a Roberto.

08:54.935 --> 08:58.203
What is that creature
doing in my school?

08:58.305 --> 09:01.106
His name's Fizz and you hired him.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.241
I think he means our new pet.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.376
Pet?

09:04.478 --> 09:05.944
After The Pajama Massacre,

09:06.046 --> 09:07.979
a furry distraction
is the last thing you need.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.714
We wanna make him our school mascot.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.249
Why? We've got Buttercup.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.652
Knight school! Knight school!

09:13.754 --> 09:15.086
It's the right school!

09:15.188 --> 09:17.722
For people who
are training to be knights...

09:17.824 --> 09:19.791
school!

09:20.928 --> 09:22.894
Oh, well, it's settled then.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.796
Say goodbye to your furry stinkball.

09:31.204 --> 09:34.706
Come on, Sir Gareth.
Look how cute he is.

09:36.843 --> 09:39.244
Slobber puffs are
known to cause mischief.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.479
Plus, there's a pouch on their back

09:41.582 --> 09:42.447
just like a kangaroo...

09:42.549 --> 09:44.983
Which is a weird body part.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.152
What's wrong with having a back pouch?

09:47.254 --> 09:48.620
I could put my lunch in there.

09:48.722 --> 09:49.955
I wouldn't do that.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.823
They go crazy, if you touch their pouch.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.358
Prudence is right.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.526
Watch.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.332
- Ah!
- What?

10:02.736 --> 10:05.036
He has a pouch potato?

10:05.138 --> 10:07.172
He comes with his own snacks.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.909
Okay, what if we train
him so he behaves?

10:11.011 --> 10:12.911
I promise he'll grow on you.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.614
Give me one good reason
why I should let you keep him.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.220
He does have good aim.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.456
Okay, if you can take care of him,

10:24.558 --> 10:25.523
you can keep him.

10:25.626 --> 10:26.758
Yes!

10:26.860 --> 10:28.493
We won't let him out of our sight.

10:28.595 --> 10:29.961
He's rolling away.

10:31.598 --> 10:34.366
Oh, come on, Slobwick, you're
makin' us look like fools.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.378
Welcome to the Dragon
Blood Crystal Room.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.981
One time, I saw a monkey riding on a pig

10:50.083 --> 10:52.517
and I thought that
was the coolest thing ever.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.319
But this...

10:54.421 --> 10:56.488
this is the coolest thing ever!

10:57.824 --> 11:00.725
Okay, you came, I trusted you. Let's go.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.327
Oh, can I hold one of the crystals?

11:04.331 --> 11:07.966
I've never held anything
so... valuable before.

11:08.068 --> 11:11.202
Oh, except this awesome
tiara I once stole.

11:11.304 --> 11:14.272
Oh, right, you were there.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.974
No touching!

11:16.076 --> 11:18.043
If the crystals move even an inch,

11:18.145 --> 11:20.712
it can weaken the force field
that protects the kingdom.

11:20.814 --> 11:23.281
Fine. I don't have to touch one.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.717
I'll just take a selfie
with my magic mirror.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.986
You can't take a selfie here.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.121
I just wanna send one to my dad.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.624
I haven't told him I'm in Astoria yet.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.526
A picture with these crystals

11:34.628 --> 11:35.994
would show that I'm here

11:36.096 --> 11:38.530
and I'm making my dreams come true.

11:38.632 --> 11:40.665
Awww... that's so sweet.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.467
So I can take a selfie?

11:42.569 --> 11:44.369
Not a chance.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.772
No one can ever know you were here.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.040
Okay.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.875
But you don't get to see a picture

11:50.977 --> 11:52.610
of a monkey riding a pig, then.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.314
Oh! You've got to! It's way too good.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.184
Whoa!

11:59.286 --> 12:02.353
You didn't say they had hats.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.964
I love our sunrise yoga sessions.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.233
But did you have to empty the courtyard?

12:15.335 --> 12:18.636
Yes. I don't like people
looking at my downward dog.

12:20.707 --> 12:23.541
And switch to Warrior 2.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.949
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

12:31.051 --> 12:34.753
Just who I was looking for...

12:34.855 --> 12:36.955
The false king of Astoria.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.523
Ryker?

12:38.625 --> 12:40.692
No, it's just his hologram.
He's not really here.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.060
Not yet.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.429
So, you still have time to go and change

12:44.531 --> 12:47.599
out of your embarrassing yoga outfit.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.134
How is this possible?

12:49.236 --> 12:51.736
Something must be wrong with
the dragon blood crystals.

12:51.838 --> 12:54.739
Your force field is losing power,

12:54.841 --> 12:56.407
and when it falls,

12:56.510 --> 13:00.578
so will your kingdom!

13:04.384 --> 13:06.785
Oh, no, Ryker's coming.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.495
Wizard Hogancross, what's happening?

13:17.597 --> 13:19.531
I've located the problem.

13:19.633 --> 13:23.034
One of the dragon blood
crystals is missing.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.336
We can see that. We all have eyes.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.873
Some of us more than others.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.308
No, that's all right.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.710
I only need one to see that
we're in deep dragon doo-doo.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.315
The force field is weakening.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.585
In a few hours,
the crystals will fail...

13:45.158 --> 13:46.658
Did I say a few hours?

13:46.760 --> 13:48.626
I meant right now!

13:48.728 --> 13:50.728
There's only three crystals left.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.030
When they're gone,

13:52.132 --> 13:53.865
nothing will stop
Ryker from coming here.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.667
Which is bad news for anyone

13:55.769 --> 13:57.735
who can't poof themselves
hundreds of miles away.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.506
How could we lose
a dragon blood crystal?

14:01.608 --> 14:04.142
Oh, um, it appears a thief
broke in and stole it.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.744
We found this bone wedged in the door.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.413
A turkey bone?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.748
A nasty, double crossing turkey bone!

14:12.252 --> 14:13.952
How do you know what it is?

14:14.054 --> 14:17.455
How could I not know what it is?

14:17.557 --> 14:19.724
Thanksgiving is my jam!

14:20.961 --> 14:22.460
That's true.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.964
She even likes that weird green
bean casserole no one wants.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.866
Ugh!

14:27.968 --> 14:30.068
We're running out of time.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.036
To restore the force
field to full power,

14:32.138 --> 14:34.706
we must get that crystal back!

14:34.808 --> 14:36.808
Which means catching
the thief who stole it.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.042
I'll summon the guards.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.411
Good, but keep this between us.

14:40.513 --> 14:43.014
Word of a Ryker attack
could cause a panic.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.249
Remember when people thought

14:44.351 --> 14:45.617
the kingdom was out of hotdogs?

14:47.120 --> 14:48.019
Remember?

14:48.121 --> 14:49.554
I got my left ankle chewed off

14:49.656 --> 14:51.256
during The Great Wiener Riots.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.724
Forced aware.

14:54.294 --> 14:57.028
How could I be so stupid?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.964
Oh, liking green bean casserole

15:00.066 --> 15:03.234
doesn't make you stupid.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.870
It just makes you weird.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.941
You found Slobwick.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.109
Where was he?

15:11.211 --> 15:12.443
We looked for him everywhere.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.445
Then we got tired and took a nap.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.381
When we woke up, he was there.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.984
And they said we couldn't
take care of a pet.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.922
Oh, is that thing really back?

15:24.024 --> 15:26.991
Yes. But I thought you
loved Sir Talking Hand.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.927
What's up, m'lady?

15:31.264 --> 15:32.730
I meant the slobber puff.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.699
You know I think your
talking hand is hilarious.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.369
Don't worry about Slobwick.
We're training him.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.038
He gets a chicken nugget every time

15:40.140 --> 15:41.406
he listens to a command.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.341
Oh, the nugget system.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.243
That's how my parents potty trained me.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.779
Except they used a whole chicken.

15:49.215 --> 15:50.715
Ahhh...

15:56.022 --> 15:57.155
Ohhh...

15:57.257 --> 16:02.026
look, Sage, isn't he just
the cutest little spitwad ever?

16:04.364 --> 16:06.864
Come on, give him a pet.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.466
Fine.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.301
I guess one pet couldn't hurt.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.608
Don't look, Sir Talking Hand.

16:23.350 --> 16:27.719
Look what that furball did to me!

16:27.821 --> 16:31.356
Oh, you are definitely
getting a nugget for that.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.793
Ooh, something bad must be happening.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.829
Bad? No. Oh, no. We're just, um...

16:37.931 --> 16:41.566
urgently grabbing weapons to-o-o-o-o...

16:42.969 --> 16:44.869
blend our smoothies.

16:44.971 --> 16:48.006
Sir, that stupid
slobber puff attacked me.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.440
Tell them to get rid of it.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.742
Get rid of it!

16:50.844 --> 16:52.577
Well, that was easier than I thought.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.246
You can't do that, Sir Gareth.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.347
Actually, I can.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.949
That thing is trouble.

16:58.051 --> 17:01.519
I want him gone by the time
I get the thief who stole...

17:02.789 --> 17:04.789
The protein powder for our smoothies.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.394
Sorry, Slobby.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.396
The world's just not fair
to cute little guys like us.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.433
Awww...

17:15.535 --> 17:18.202
it's so sad for you to watch him go.

17:18.304 --> 17:19.637
Now I'll grab a hatchet!

17:19.739 --> 17:23.374
Uh... we're releasing
him back into the wild.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.977
Oh, good idea.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.146
Give him a running start.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.051
Warlock, for my next course,

17:33.153 --> 17:34.986
I will have the swordfish.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.090
Mmm! Extra swordy.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.363
Hey, Ciara.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.931
Guess who recently came into some money

17:47.033 --> 17:50.001
and is now ordering off the fancy menu?

17:50.103 --> 17:52.503
- You!
- Heck, yeah, me!

17:52.605 --> 17:54.105
Now the craziest thing happened.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.606
I fell asleep in the courtyard,

17:55.708 --> 17:57.608
and people dropped money in my hat.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.078
I know you went back
to the crystal room.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.346
I absolutely did not go back.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.515
They found your turkey
bone wedged in the door.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.418
I absolutely might have gone back.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.856
How could you do this to me?
I trusted you.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.057
Let me explain.

18:13.159 --> 18:14.859
That you stole one of
the dragon blood crystals

18:14.961 --> 18:16.494
and endangered the entire kingdom?

18:16.596 --> 18:17.728
Yes. I mean, no.

18:17.831 --> 18:19.664
I mean, what is happening?

18:19.766 --> 18:21.165
You're about to get arrested.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.300
That's what's happening.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.102
Ciara, step aside.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.204
Arc, the Princess informed us

18:26.306 --> 18:28.973
that this turkey bone belongs to you.

18:29.075 --> 18:32.443
You are under arrest for
stealing a dragon blood crystal.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.345
But I didn't... I didn't do it!

18:34.447 --> 18:36.347
Take him away!

18:36.449 --> 18:37.615
I'll...

18:37.717 --> 18:39.317
I'll just confiscate...

18:39.419 --> 18:40.885
this delicious...

18:40.987 --> 18:42.120
evidence.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.531
And then Fizz said

18:53.633 --> 18:55.466
he wanted to be the one
to let Slobwick go.

18:55.568 --> 18:58.536
I never even got to try
his pouch potato.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.739
I know it hurts,

19:01.841 --> 19:03.941
but you still have your friends.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.610
Guys...

19:05.712 --> 19:07.545
Arc was just arrested.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.915
My world is crumbling.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.918
Why would they arrest Arc?

19:14.020 --> 19:16.454
He stole a dragon blood crystal.

19:16.556 --> 19:17.688
This has to be a mistake.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.357
Arc wouldn't put the kingdom in danger.

19:19.459 --> 19:20.591
They have proof

19:20.693 --> 19:22.160
and they found him at the Tasty Trunk

19:22.262 --> 19:23.561
ordering off the fancy menu.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.497
No! Not the fancy menu.

19:28.101 --> 19:30.868
I know it's hard, but you have to accept

19:30.970 --> 19:33.070
Arc's not who we thought he was.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.805
Yes, he is.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.742
I'm gonna go tell them
they've got the wrong guy.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.544
And I'm gonna go with him.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.579
I think it's been a hard day.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.681
It's been a really hard day, okay?

19:45.185 --> 19:46.851
Yeah.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.526
We're running out of time!

19:57.297 --> 19:58.896
Tell me what I wanna know!

19:58.998 --> 20:00.631
I can't.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.800
Because I didn't take
the dragon blood crystal.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.803
So, what, it just magically walked away?

20:05.905 --> 20:07.638
Maybe.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.907
Weird things happen in Astoria.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.877
Yesterday, I saw a fairy poop gumdrops.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.378
That's enough!

20:14.480 --> 20:17.014
I guess we're doing this the hard way!

20:17.116 --> 20:19.350
No! Not the sword!

20:19.452 --> 20:21.118
I'm sorry, wrong sheath.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.691
A feather?

20:26.793 --> 20:28.893
What, you're gonna tickle it outta me?

20:28.995 --> 20:30.528
Oh! You are!

20:30.630 --> 20:32.163
Where's the crystal?

20:32.265 --> 20:35.666
Please! Stop it!

20:35.768 --> 20:37.902
My skin's too delicate for this!

20:40.640 --> 20:42.440
Sir Gareth, what are you doing?

20:42.542 --> 20:44.275
Uh, tickle tactics.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.077
It's advanced knight stuff.

20:47.981 --> 20:49.347
But you've got the wrong guy.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.450
Yeah, Arc would never take
that dragon blood crystal.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.252
Aw, thanks, guys.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.220
I'd hug you, but...

20:56.322 --> 20:58.923
I can't feel my arms.

20:59.025 --> 21:02.026
Arresting Arc is a travesty of justice!

21:02.128 --> 21:05.663
And I'm fairly certain I used
that word correctly.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.099
This is a matter of
private castle security.

21:08.201 --> 21:09.400
No one should be here.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.668
Sir Gareth, I'm here.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.236
Oh, fantastic, it's a party.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.538
I'll make a seven-layer dip.

21:14.641 --> 21:18.075
All right, you've seen what
a liar and a thief looks like.

21:18.177 --> 21:19.277
Time to go.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.713
Oh, good goblin,
the shield is getting weaker.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.749
Where is the dragon blood crystal?

21:24.851 --> 21:27.351
You're right. The kingdom's in danger.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.654
It's time to confess.

21:29.756 --> 21:32.223
That I always keep
a lock pick up my sleeve.

21:32.325 --> 21:34.158
He's escaping!

21:40.767 --> 21:43.267
You still think Arc's innocent?

21:43.369 --> 21:45.269
I can't believe it.

21:45.371 --> 21:46.937
Arc's really a thief.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.914
The force field's flickering.
Flickering's bad.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.685
Wizard Hogancross,
please check on the crystals.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.989
There are three crystals remaining.

22:05.091 --> 22:08.693
As long as they glow, Astoria is safe.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.898
Stupid crystals.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.966
We're doomed!

22:16.069 --> 22:17.501
And I never learned to play guitar.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.670
Daddy, you have to be brave

22:19.772 --> 22:21.539
for the sake of the kingdom.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.441
Think of what calms you.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.576
Ohhhh... okay.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.511
Sunsets.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.046
Chocolate fountains.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.215
Ryker's gonna destroy us.

22:31.317 --> 22:32.983
This isn't working!

22:34.287 --> 22:38.222
But if we don't return
the stolen dragon crystal soon,

22:38.324 --> 22:40.491
Astoria is no more.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.259
The King is freaking out.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.794
Tell him some good news.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.464
Well... I can poof
anywhere in the world,

22:46.566 --> 22:49.133
and I just got new swim trunks.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.571
Please, close your robe!

22:53.673 --> 22:56.407
We've all been through enough today.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.210
Your Majesty!

22:59.312 --> 23:01.479
We can't find Arc,
but we will hunt him down

23:01.581 --> 23:04.281
and fix this before Ryker shows
his ugly face around here.

23:06.119 --> 23:07.785
He's behind me, isn't he?

23:09.088 --> 23:11.789
Yes, and his very handsome face

23:11.891 --> 23:14.392
is ready to reclaim his crown.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.793
Watch this!

23:18.865 --> 23:20.664
Good goblin, the force field is so weak,

23:20.767 --> 23:22.433
he's using dark magic to make a portal.

23:22.535 --> 23:26.070
Soon my warriors will
be able to pass through

23:26.172 --> 23:29.940
and I will conquer Astoria!

23:31.411 --> 23:33.477
Oh, this is really bad.

23:33.579 --> 23:36.981
Run, oh, gasper, I need you!

23:41.053 --> 23:42.119
But I thought Ryker couldn't attack

23:42.221 --> 23:43.721
until all five crystals went dark.

23:43.823 --> 23:46.123
He can't. But his warriors can!

23:47.560 --> 23:49.326
You don't have to gasp at everything.

23:49.429 --> 23:50.361
It cheapens the gasp.

23:50.463 --> 23:53.664
Sir Gareth, to hold off Ryker's army,

23:53.766 --> 23:54.899
we'll need your best knights.

23:55.001 --> 23:56.133
Well, they're scattered
across the kingdom

23:56.235 --> 23:57.735
looking for that thief Arc.

23:57.837 --> 24:00.037
I'm... I'm the only knight
left in the castle.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.739
What about your knight school students?

24:01.841 --> 24:03.808
They're not ready.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.209
And after their last drill,

24:05.311 --> 24:07.077
I'm not sure they ever will be.

24:07.180 --> 24:10.114
You try fighting in pajamas!

24:10.216 --> 24:13.417
Which is what I heard they had to do.

24:15.288 --> 24:16.954
It looks like our only hope is

24:17.056 --> 24:21.559
Sir Gareth taking on
an entire army by himself.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.530
Now is when you gasp.
Get it together, man!

24:32.939 --> 24:35.706
My best friend's a thief and a traitor?

24:35.808 --> 24:37.641
Do you think they'll catch him?

24:37.743 --> 24:39.043
Please...

24:39.145 --> 24:40.644
Arc's probably half way
across the kingdom by now.

24:40.746 --> 24:42.046
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.681
Whoa!

24:45.084 --> 24:46.317
I need to talk to you guys.

24:46.419 --> 24:48.152
Don't bother. We're turning you in.

24:48.254 --> 24:51.455
Yeah, let's go, Arc,
if that is your real name.

24:51.557 --> 24:53.958
Guys, look, I'm innocent, all right?

24:54.060 --> 24:55.759
I need you two to help me prove it.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.294
You think we're going to help you

24:57.396 --> 24:58.963
after you betrayed the whole kingdom?

24:59.065 --> 25:01.065
I didn't steal the crystal.

25:01.167 --> 25:04.034
Then prove it by showing
me where the crystal is.

25:05.404 --> 25:07.371
Man, I thought he'd fall for that.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.941
Look, I did break into the crystal room,

25:11.043 --> 25:14.678
but for a really important reason.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.181
I needed a selfie.

25:17.283 --> 25:20.117
That's the most shallow
reason I've ever heard.

25:20.219 --> 25:23.587
Oh, those crystals do
make your eyes pop.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.990
You can use it as your mug shot.

25:26.092 --> 25:28.859
No, look, all the crystals are there.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.428
The thief stole it after
I took this picture.

25:31.531 --> 25:35.299
Or you took the picture
and then stole the crystal.

25:35.401 --> 25:38.969
I'm just saying you had options.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.404
I really thought that picture

25:40.506 --> 25:41.972
would help me prove I didn't do it.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.942
Wait, what's this on the wall?

25:45.044 --> 25:47.111
I got this.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.746
Exevalo plucky-plucky!

25:50.516 --> 25:51.749
Oh, gross!

25:54.787 --> 25:55.953
It's slobber.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.323
How do you know
what slobber tastes like?

25:59.425 --> 26:02.126
I don't have to answer that.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.061
We found a slobber puff.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.396
He must have followed Arc,

26:05.498 --> 26:07.998
swiped the crystal,
and hid it in his pouch.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.769
You're not a thief.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.337
I'm sorry we didn't believe you, Arc.

26:13.439 --> 26:15.439
That means we can still be best friends.

26:15.541 --> 26:16.373
Bestie bumps!

26:16.475 --> 26:18.442
Up top, in the middle,

26:18.544 --> 26:21.245
slide, downtown!

26:21.347 --> 26:23.714
Aw, you're dorks again.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.482
Oh, we're not done yet.

26:25.585 --> 26:29.286
Karate chop, elbow, wink!

26:29.388 --> 26:31.055
Okay, now we're done.

26:32.325 --> 26:35.192
Oh, good, because the entire
fate of the kingdom

26:35.294 --> 26:36.594
hinges on finding that slobber puff.

26:36.696 --> 26:39.697
- Oh, we forgot the spin.
- Unh-unh, let's go!

26:46.339 --> 26:48.672
Why do you think
Sir Gareth called us here?

26:48.774 --> 26:52.910
Ooh, maybe it's a surprise
birthday party for me.

26:53.012 --> 26:54.345
It's not your birthday.

26:54.447 --> 26:57.514
What's why I'd be surprised.

26:59.919 --> 27:02.019
Oh, late much?

27:02.121 --> 27:03.821
Oh, Sage, it's so sweet that

27:03.923 --> 27:05.456
no matter how scary things get,

27:05.558 --> 27:07.524
you'll always be a pain in my butt.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.828
I'm glad you appreciate my work.

27:12.231 --> 27:14.098
Students, I called you here because

27:14.200 --> 27:16.033
the castle is about to be attacked.

27:17.370 --> 27:19.169
You want us to ready our weapons?

27:19.271 --> 27:21.138
No, I want you to hide.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.907
I know you're disappointed in us,

27:24.010 --> 27:25.909
but give us a chance to help you fight.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.378
You saw what happened in that drill.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.979
If I took you into a real battle,

27:29.081 --> 27:30.347
you'd only get hurt.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.950
Now find your squad mates
and get somewhere safe.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.218
Yes, Sir Gareth.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.589
What, you're just gonna
defend the castle alone?

27:38.691 --> 27:41.592
No, not alone.
I'm bringing an old friend.

27:46.799 --> 27:51.001
Say hello to Sir Gareth's
super-scary spikey fist.

27:51.103 --> 27:54.872
What a silly name.

27:54.974 --> 27:57.408
You said it, Sir Talking Hand.

27:57.510 --> 27:59.176
Ha!

27:59.278 --> 28:00.878
You should send him to fight Ryker,

28:00.980 --> 28:02.046
because he kills me.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.248
Hmph!

28:11.123 --> 28:12.322
Look, there's Fizz.

28:12.425 --> 28:14.191
Remember, everybody in
the kingdom is looking for me,

28:14.293 --> 28:16.593
so don't do anything to draw attention.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.463
I think you lost that battle

28:19.565 --> 28:21.231
when you put on the mysterious cloak.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.036
Hey, Fizz.

28:26.138 --> 28:29.006
Who's the dude in the mysterious cloak?

28:29.108 --> 28:32.076
Oh, that's just my new friend...

28:32.178 --> 28:35.312
Cloaky Kardashian.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.181
Where did you release Slobwick?

28:37.283 --> 28:38.916
He's miles away by now.

28:41.287 --> 28:42.986
Did your bag just fart?

28:43.089 --> 28:44.855
No, that was me.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.659
Wait, no, Slobwick's
in there! Grab him, Arc!

28:48.761 --> 28:51.261
Come out of there, slobber puff!

28:51.363 --> 28:52.996
I need that crystal!

28:53.099 --> 28:54.665
Ow!

28:54.767 --> 28:56.033
He bit my hand!

28:57.369 --> 28:58.702
He's getting away!

29:01.240 --> 29:03.140
What are you two doing with this thief?

29:03.242 --> 29:04.541
Sorry, but we don't have time for this.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.577
Get ready for a giant hug.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.680
Go! Go! Go!

29:11.450 --> 29:12.916
Prudy, I have to stop Arc!

29:13.018 --> 29:14.251
And I can't let you.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.453
Look, they're giving
away free coconut drinks!

29:16.555 --> 29:18.322
Oh, from the fancy menu?

29:18.424 --> 29:20.624
Oh, she knows me so well!

29:25.064 --> 29:26.497
What's happening, Wizard?

29:26.599 --> 29:27.765
Let's check.

29:30.436 --> 29:33.904
Oh, good goblin, we're down
to one dragon blood crystal.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.539
We're done for!

29:35.641 --> 29:37.908
Bring me my the-end-is-near crown.

29:39.645 --> 29:41.812
If you need me, I'll be hiding
in my chocolate fountain.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.584
That portal is almost big enough

29:47.686 --> 29:50.320
for Ryker's warriors to come through.

29:50.422 --> 29:53.524
Which means I'm the castle's only hope.

29:53.626 --> 29:54.925
Well, don't forget about me.

29:55.027 --> 29:56.093
I'm totes brave.

29:57.363 --> 30:00.631
Monster! Shoo!

30:00.733 --> 30:02.232
Relax.

30:02.334 --> 30:04.635
It's just that slobbery rat.

30:04.737 --> 30:06.837
And the rat who stole the crystal.

30:06.939 --> 30:07.838
Halt, thief!

30:10.242 --> 30:12.476
You'll never get
through the Wick brothers.

30:12.578 --> 30:13.877
Huh!

30:16.182 --> 30:19.216
I mean, technically,
you didn't go through us, so...

30:21.220 --> 30:22.452
I got you!

30:22.555 --> 30:24.755
I have to see what's in that pocket!

30:24.857 --> 30:27.224
Yes! I have the crystal!

30:27.326 --> 30:29.927
The kingdom is saved.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.128
I wish Ciara could see this.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.734
Wait, Ciara, wait!

30:37.837 --> 30:39.036
Ooh, too late.

30:40.372 --> 30:41.805
Arc didn't take the crystal.

30:41.907 --> 30:44.641
He just pulled it out of
the slobber puff's pouch.

30:46.745 --> 30:48.045
Arc's innocent?

30:48.147 --> 30:49.279
There's no time to explain.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.981
We need that crystal.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.251
Sir Gareth, look out!

30:56.355 --> 30:58.155
Oh, no, the crystal!

31:09.134 --> 31:10.601
It's the real Commander Umbala.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.104
I'm not scared.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.840
I just want to know what the
inside of a barrel looks like.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.288
I can't break these shackles.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.789
They're giant proof.

31:32.892 --> 31:36.026
Yes, they're even too
strong for my massive muscles.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.765
- Get your lock pick out.
- I dropped it.

31:41.867 --> 31:44.067
And the goon with
the keys is using it to...

31:44.169 --> 31:45.469
Clean his ears.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.409
I have one of the dragon blood crystals.

31:52.511 --> 31:53.710
Excellent.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.612
Guard that crystal with your life.

31:55.714 --> 31:57.147
As long as you have it,

31:57.249 --> 31:59.683
nothing can stop me from returning.

31:59.785 --> 32:01.551
Your wish is my command, King Ryker.

32:01.654 --> 32:04.521
I'm not king until that
last crystal goes dark.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.957
Come on, Umbala! We've been over this!

32:09.395 --> 32:11.328
Round up the royal family.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.930
I want them to see my coronation.

32:13.032 --> 32:16.033
I'd like a crowd of weeping people.

32:17.202 --> 32:19.736
You heard him! Find
the King and the Princess!

32:21.941 --> 32:23.907
I should have just believed you.

32:24.009 --> 32:25.042
It's all my fault.

32:25.144 --> 32:26.543
No, it's my fault.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.478
I should have never snuck
into that crystal room

32:28.580 --> 32:30.113
and taken that selfie.

32:30.215 --> 32:33.550
You didn't know you'd be
followed by a furry spit bucket.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.452
He's a slobber bucket.

32:35.554 --> 32:36.987
Okay, words matter.

32:38.457 --> 32:39.990
Hey, knuckleheads,

32:40.092 --> 32:41.959
we're chained up and
the kingdom is falling.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.094
Maybe zip your yap holes.

32:50.002 --> 32:51.935
When my fearsome warrior, Sir Gareth,

32:52.037 --> 32:55.339
finds out you abducted me, you'll pay.

32:55.441 --> 32:56.974
Uh, hello?

32:58.377 --> 32:59.643
Never mind.

33:03.916 --> 33:06.350
Now! Tell me where your daughter is!

33:06.452 --> 33:07.784
I'll never tell you.

33:07.886 --> 33:09.553
We have to do something.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.221
I'll handle this.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.657
Oh, Miss Umbala?

33:13.759 --> 33:15.158
I know where the Princess is.

33:15.260 --> 33:16.626
What are you doing?

33:16.729 --> 33:17.995
Get him up!

33:18.097 --> 33:19.930
Where is she?

33:20.032 --> 33:21.665
The Princess...

33:21.767 --> 33:24.434
is in my friend Warwick's dreams.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.069
He's right about that.

33:30.309 --> 33:33.510
In your face, Dumbala!

33:33.612 --> 33:36.880
No one's called me that
since the third grade.

33:36.982 --> 33:38.148
Shall I get the hammer, boss?

33:38.250 --> 33:41.184
Yes! We'll smash
the answers out of them!

33:41.286 --> 33:43.553
Why are you making
the Mohawk guy even angrier?

33:43.655 --> 33:45.455
So, I could grab these.

33:45.557 --> 33:46.790
You stole the keys?

33:46.892 --> 33:48.658
Bold move after just clearing
your name for stealing.

33:48.761 --> 33:50.594
But it's appreciated.

33:51.864 --> 33:53.897
All right, unlock
yourselves, but be quiet.

33:53.999 --> 33:55.832
These students you
say are so unprepared,

33:55.934 --> 33:57.701
seem to be doing quite well.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.206
Oops.

34:05.144 --> 34:07.010
Escaping's hard, guys.

34:08.112 --> 34:09.112
Get them!

34:10.815 --> 34:12.449
Go!

34:15.187 --> 34:17.654
Leave me. Just get my
daughter out of the kingdom.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.389
Your Majesty, I can't leave you.

34:19.491 --> 34:20.956
I said, go.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.391
Come on!

34:26.197 --> 34:28.231
They're just children! Forget them!

34:36.975 --> 34:39.909
They won't soon forget that
smackdown we just gave them.

34:48.620 --> 34:49.886
Where is everybody?

34:49.987 --> 34:51.388
You're supposed to say,

34:51.489 --> 34:53.322
come out, come out, wherever you are!

34:54.626 --> 34:56.525
It's Arc! Arrest him!

34:56.628 --> 34:58.628
No, wait! Arc's innocent.

34:58.730 --> 34:59.729
I tackled him...

34:59.832 --> 35:01.298
It's a long story.

35:03.902 --> 35:05.469
Commander Umbala and her warriors

35:05.571 --> 35:07.571
have captured the King and Sir Gareth.

35:07.673 --> 35:10.574
No! I just got married.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.776
Well, there goes the honeymoon.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.614
Look, Ryker will be here soon.

35:17.716 --> 35:18.748
Sir Gareth told us to get

35:18.851 --> 35:21.184
as far away from the castle as possible.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.686
Good luck, everyone.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.754
Wait, you're not coming with us?

35:24.857 --> 35:26.590
I can't leave.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.726
Look, this is all
happening because of me.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.495
I have to at least try and fix it.

35:31.597 --> 35:32.929
I can't run, either.

35:33.031 --> 35:34.831
Astoria is where my family is.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.366
It's where the King is.

35:39.037 --> 35:40.403
I'm in.

35:40.506 --> 35:41.938
Giants don't run.

35:42.040 --> 35:42.906
Seriously.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.975
When we do, buildings get stepped on.

35:46.278 --> 35:48.678
Well, you know I'm not goin' anywhere.

35:48.780 --> 35:51.581
I've gotta save the Princess.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.416
What about your brother?

35:53.519 --> 35:55.218
That was implied, Ciara.

35:57.523 --> 36:00.290
Well, I'm staying, too.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.791
Well, don't look so shocked.

36:01.894 --> 36:03.126
I care about things.

36:06.098 --> 36:08.598
So, do we all wanna stay and fight?

36:08.700 --> 36:10.300
Yeah!

36:10.402 --> 36:11.501
Then let's do this.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.470
But Sir Gareth says we're not ready.

36:13.572 --> 36:14.704
Maybe we aren't.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.473
But we don't get to pick the moment

36:16.575 --> 36:17.874
you're asked to be heroes.

36:17.976 --> 36:19.376
Those moments pick us.

36:19.478 --> 36:21.611
There's still time to get
the dragon blood crystal back

36:21.713 --> 36:22.846
and stop Ryker.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.514
So, let's go save the kingdom.

36:24.616 --> 36:25.715
For Astoria!

36:25.817 --> 36:27.350
For Astoria!

36:33.358 --> 36:35.926
While we wait to give Ryker this,

36:36.028 --> 36:40.630
I'm just gonna smash the rest
of your real body parts.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.232
Well, that won't take long,

36:42.334 --> 36:43.700
so, ha, joke's on you.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.169
Hey, Dumbala!

36:49.775 --> 36:51.942
I'm here to take back
the dragon blood crystal!

36:52.044 --> 36:53.410
You and what army?

36:53.512 --> 36:54.744
This army!

36:54.846 --> 36:55.912
Attack!

36:56.014 --> 36:57.447
Attack!

37:24.042 --> 37:26.376
Let's get those chains off.

37:32.284 --> 37:34.251
Make sure to tell
your daughter I saved you.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.585
Thanks for saving me.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.153
But it's not gonna happen.

37:38.357 --> 37:41.391
Your Majesty, I must
poof you to safety...

37:41.493 --> 37:42.626
And I know just the beach.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.529
This is Sparky!

37:46.632 --> 37:48.565
He'll be battling you today.

37:54.273 --> 37:56.172
Oh! Oh!

38:05.984 --> 38:07.384
Quark anky, stoppy stoppy!

38:07.486 --> 38:08.685
Uh! Uh!

38:08.787 --> 38:10.020
Why can't I move?

38:10.122 --> 38:12.088
Because this idiot's
magic worked for once.

38:12.190 --> 38:14.658
You wanna insult me or kick him?

38:14.760 --> 38:15.692
I can do both.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.734
It's slobber time!

38:31.276 --> 38:32.042
Thanks.

38:32.144 --> 38:34.344
If we live, the rat ball can stay.

38:34.446 --> 38:35.578
Yes!

38:38.150 --> 38:40.083
Way to kick butt, Butt.

38:40.185 --> 38:42.218
Way to kick booty, Prudy.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.294
Look, we need to corner
Umbala and get that crystal!

38:55.767 --> 38:56.966
How are we gonna stop her?

38:57.069 --> 38:58.601
Ah!

39:00.339 --> 39:01.338
That'll work.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.147
She's coming!

39:11.249 --> 39:12.782
Hurry up and put
the crystal back before she...

39:16.955 --> 39:18.488
...blocks us from saving the kingdom.

39:27.399 --> 39:30.433
Make this easy! Give me the crystal!

39:30.535 --> 39:31.668
Not happening.

39:43.215 --> 39:46.015
Ha! This your first fight?

39:46.118 --> 39:47.217
For your information,

39:47.319 --> 39:49.686
we fought a fake you
during our pajama party.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.963
Who's the Dumbala now?

40:02.100 --> 40:04.567
The last crystal is about to die.

40:06.338 --> 40:08.538
Now, look, we have to try
the Flying Phoenix Kick.

40:08.640 --> 40:09.806
But we've never landed it.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.508
If we miss this one, Astoria's over.

40:11.610 --> 40:12.809
Then we'd better not miss.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.956
Tell Ryker the Phoenix Squad says hi.

40:27.058 --> 40:28.958
Oh, we're the Phoenix Squad.

40:30.328 --> 40:32.529
Well, there's two more of us.
They're just in the castle.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.432
Hey, we should probably
put the crystal back.

40:35.534 --> 40:36.499
Oh!

40:49.548 --> 40:50.647
Uh-oh!

40:56.087 --> 40:57.887
Do you think they put the crystal back?

40:57.989 --> 40:59.489
Whoa!

41:01.326 --> 41:03.293
They put the crystal back.

41:03.395 --> 41:05.094
The portal's reversing!

41:11.436 --> 41:13.002
This isn't over.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.704
One day I will return

41:14.806 --> 41:17.907
to crush Astoria once and for all!

41:18.009 --> 41:20.109
But not today, you big-headed dumb-dumb.

41:22.314 --> 41:23.680
He can't come through that, right?

41:23.782 --> 41:25.114
You'd better hope not.

41:30.388 --> 41:31.754
We did it!

41:31.857 --> 41:33.156
Especially Arc and Ciara!

41:33.258 --> 41:34.524
Ah, ah, easy now.

41:40.632 --> 41:45.568
Sir Gareth, all of Astoria
commends your bravery

41:45.670 --> 41:47.003
in our time of need.

41:47.105 --> 41:48.071
Thank you, Your Majesty.

41:48.173 --> 41:51.274
But the credit belongs to the students.

41:51.376 --> 41:53.977
They've proved that they may
just become great knights yet.

41:54.079 --> 41:58.281
Yes, you all stood tall
in the face of crisis.

41:58.383 --> 42:00.483
While somebody went to the beach.

42:02.153 --> 42:03.953
What's the point of having a beach bod,

42:04.055 --> 42:05.822
if you're not going to use it?

42:07.158 --> 42:09.859
Students, I bestow upon you

42:09.961 --> 42:12.662
the greatest honor a king can bestow.

42:14.833 --> 42:17.467
A royal "good job, guys."

42:17.569 --> 42:20.336
Guard, bring my good- job-guys crown.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.809
Good job, guys!

42:29.581 --> 42:32.916
You know, I've never gotten
a "good job, guys" before.

42:33.018 --> 42:35.051
It's very satisfying.

42:35.153 --> 42:36.819
Hey, how about you send your dad

42:36.922 --> 42:39.656
an I-just-saved- the-kingdom selfie?

42:39.758 --> 42:40.924
Good idea.

42:41.026 --> 42:42.559
I sent him the crystal room selfie

42:42.661 --> 42:43.760
and he never responded.

42:43.862 --> 42:45.228
He still has no idea where I am.

42:45.330 --> 42:48.998
Actually, he knows
exactly where you are.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.400
Dad?

42:50.502 --> 42:51.801
Hello, son.

42:51.903 --> 42:54.103
I've come to take you home.

42:54.205 --> 43:00.500
