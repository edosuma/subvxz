00:00.000 --> 00:01.840
(bell chimes)

00:03.520 --> 00:05.000
(spy music)

00:19.760 --> 00:22.040
Hit it!
(funky music plays)

00:34.400 --> 00:36.160
Cute and cuddly, boys.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.360
(alarm sounds)

00:50.440 --> 00:52.960
(computer voice) "Impact imminent."

00:53.040 --> 00:56.080
Appears to be a meteor, Skipper,
coming in hot and fast!

00:56.160 --> 00:59.160
Something tells me
this is not good at all.

00:59.800 --> 01:00.920
I've got a visual!

01:03.920 --> 01:05.720
Give me the worst-case scenario.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.120
It wipes out the Eastern Seaboard.
Aww...

01:08.200 --> 01:09.680
Best-case scenario?

01:09.760 --> 01:13.080
Erm... Ohio is suddenly
beach front property?

01:13.160 --> 01:14.520
Er... Cleveland!

01:14.600 --> 01:17.840
Negatory. I like the beach
where it is. Rico!

01:21.880 --> 01:23.000
Meteors can do that?

01:23.080 --> 01:26.800
Well, technically speaking, nuh-uh!
Brace for impact!

01:29.160 --> 01:31.440
Is that...
It can't be.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.960
But it is. It's...
Lemmy!

01:34.040 --> 01:36.800
You have come back home!

01:36.880 --> 01:40.560
How I've missed y... ow! Hot! Hot!

01:40.640 --> 01:42.560
Too hot to handle?
Of course not.

01:42.640 --> 01:45.360
Mort will give the royal
welcome home hug.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.520
Go ahead.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.760
Ow! I still don't like robot.

01:50.840 --> 01:55.920
70 million miles to Mars and back!
Give it up for craftsmanship!

01:56.000 --> 01:57.320
But why did he come back?

01:57.400 --> 01:59.960
Silly penguin, this is his home!

02:00.040 --> 02:04.000
Hold on. Last we saw, the robot was
in the grips of an evil Space Squid.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.360
How'd you escape, Lemmy?

02:07.680 --> 02:11.360
Of course. The penguin fighting
techniques we taught you!

02:11.440 --> 02:15.080
Mm, sorry. Those are
the dance moves I taught him.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.960
Go, Lemmy! Bust a movement!

02:20.120 --> 02:22.760
Hm... not sure what that is.
That's one of yours?

02:22.840 --> 02:26.320
Nope, that's definitely
one of your La-De-Da moves.

02:26.400 --> 02:29.400
I think he's trying to
tell us something.

02:29.480 --> 02:32.200
If I'm reading these signs right,
he's saying...

02:38.000 --> 02:39.160
(jabbers)

02:39.240 --> 02:41.000
Space squid! (screams)

02:43.160 --> 02:46.440
You broke robot! (giggles)
Thank you, squidy!

02:46.520 --> 02:47.520
Mort! No!

02:51.360 --> 02:55.280
It has heisted my boomy box!
And I can't move me!

02:55.360 --> 02:57.680
Mort, must it always be about you?

02:57.760 --> 03:01.880
Mort is experiencing complete
and total immobilisation.Yay!

03:01.960 --> 03:05.520
Though he retains the power of
speech. Which should be obvious.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.040
How long will it last?
A week. Maybe two.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.800
Dandy! What am I supposed to do
with him until then?

03:10.880 --> 03:14.960
I could be a feet rest!
Oh, that's a good idea, Mort!

03:15.760 --> 03:19.920
Mm... happiness is a warm foot...

03:20.680 --> 03:22.240
Er... No.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.680
(screams)
The news about Lemmy is better.

03:24.760 --> 03:28.680
His self repair protocols activated
and the head is already online!

03:28.760 --> 03:31.400
In a few hours,
Lemmy will be fully operational.

03:31.480 --> 03:35.480
Fantastic! We need every man on his
feet and fighting. Or dancing.

03:35.560 --> 03:39.000
Twinkletoes ain't gonna squash
this squid, Ringtail.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.920
Are we sure the space squid is evil?

03:41.000 --> 03:44.520
This could be a wonderful chance
to make friends across the stars.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.480
Skipper, may I?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.680
Naive nonsense, Private!

03:48.760 --> 03:52.680
Do you know what a lifetime devoted
to sci-fi movies has taught me?

03:52.760 --> 03:56.080
You'll never be a big hit
with the ladies? Besides that.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.680
Aliens are evil!
They are slimy, disgusting,

03:58.760 --> 04:03.040
and ruthlessly determined to conquer
and/or consume the penguin race.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.240
Erm, I don't know
if this is important,

04:05.320 --> 04:07.200
seems a little borderline to me,

04:07.280 --> 04:09.760
but the squidy is taking your
talking box.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.000
Grab it!

04:12.080 --> 04:14.520
Yeah, I'm not touching that.
I hear you.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.480
(penguins yell)

04:18.160 --> 04:19.720
(squid roars)

04:19.800 --> 04:20.800
(penguins yell)

04:33.320 --> 04:35.360
It got... bigger.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.480
Keen insight, Kowalski.

04:37.560 --> 04:41.600
You see, Lemmy,
penguins lack the panache!

04:41.680 --> 04:45.160
Look, this is a complex situation
with a lot of variables in play.

04:45.240 --> 04:47.080
You understand, don't you, Lemmy?

04:47.160 --> 04:51.520
See, Lemmy gets that sometimes
we're forced to improvise plans.

04:51.600 --> 04:56.280
Yes, plans like "grab it"?
You got a better idea?

04:56.360 --> 05:00.240
I say we split into teams, spread
out, and trap this Spacey Squid.

05:00.320 --> 05:03.280
That's the most... Wait,
did that actually make sense?

05:03.360 --> 05:07.080
By pure random chance, he was bound
to have a good idea sooner or later.

05:07.160 --> 05:11.120
Kowalski, Rico, eastern quadrant.
Private, lemurs, canvas the North.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.680
And, Lemmy, you're with me.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.520
Er, no. Lemmy should be with me.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.960
I am his mojo mentor,
his soul sensei.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.200
Wrong.
Lemmy's a fighter, not a prancer!

05:22.280 --> 05:24.080
Give it! Give it!

05:24.160 --> 05:26.240
(sighs) Fine, you can come with us.

05:31.160 --> 05:35.960
(clears throat) And just what, may
I ask, are you doing in my habitat?

05:36.040 --> 05:39.840
That's classified.
Need to know and top secret.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.440
I'm picking up extraterrestrial
energy. It came through here.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.720
Wait. Extraterrestrial energy?

05:45.800 --> 05:49.880
Like I said, need to know.
Well, I think I need to know!

05:49.960 --> 05:52.600
When you wake up,
all you will recall

05:52.680 --> 05:55.960
is that we spoke of
sports and weather.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.880
Erm, why are you clicking that pen?

06:02.960 --> 06:05.960
Er, I thought this was
my sonic brain eraser.

06:06.880 --> 06:07.880
My bad.

06:14.440 --> 06:17.240
There it is! (screams)

06:17.320 --> 06:18.480
(squid roars)

06:18.560 --> 06:21.600
(yells) What's going on?
Nothing. Nothing at all.

06:21.680 --> 06:25.120
Don't mind us, Marlene.
We're just looking for... something.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.840
Back to sleep! Nighty-night!

06:26.920 --> 06:30.200
Yeah. Don't think so. Not until...
What are you holding?

06:30.280 --> 06:33.520
Friendship bracelets!
For that thing we're looking for.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.080
You're looking for...
that thing is alive.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.880
That thing is alive and in here?
What is it?!

06:38.960 --> 06:40.480
That's a little hard to say.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.080
On a positive note,
I don't think it's in here.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.200
All right! You two, out of here.

06:45.280 --> 06:49.080
And tomorrow, we're going to have
a nice long chat about boundaries.

06:49.160 --> 06:52.520
Would you like a bracelet?
You are too much. Yes, thank you.

06:57.400 --> 07:01.040
Easy. Danger could lurk
around any darkened corner.

07:01.960 --> 07:05.960
Lemmy, you are like Christmas
morning, full of surprises.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.040
Check it out, I'm clubbing!

07:08.120 --> 07:12.120
(disco music)

07:12.200 --> 07:14.880
Clubbing is not in
Lemmy's mission parameters.

07:14.960 --> 07:19.520
Lemmy's mission is to have
a good time all the time.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.880
Give it!

07:20.960 --> 07:22.560
What is that...?

07:23.280 --> 07:25.680
What? I don't see anything.
Exactly.

07:25.760 --> 07:28.760
The boom box, the talking toy,
now this umbrella.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.320
What's this squid's game?

07:30.400 --> 07:35.720
Hm. Obviously, he is going to play
with the toy... in a rainstorm...

07:35.800 --> 07:37.640
while rocking a few choice tunes!

07:37.720 --> 07:39.920
Well, idiot mode is engaged again.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.440
Really? Who is this "Idiot Mode"?

07:42.520 --> 07:46.880
I do not know him or to whom
he is engaged. When is the wedding?

07:46.960 --> 07:48.200
Green corn tamales!

07:48.280 --> 07:51.960
Round up the others and get to
the Clock Tower, ASAP! What? Why?

07:52.040 --> 07:54.160
(squid roars)

08:01.280 --> 08:03.400
(squid roars)

08:03.480 --> 08:06.240
Maybe this is all just
a big misunderstanding.

08:06.320 --> 08:10.160
Maybe it just wants to phone home
to its little space friends.

08:10.720 --> 08:14.680
(computer) "Planet ripe for invasion.
Send entire fleet."

08:14.760 --> 08:18.720
OK... maybe invasion means
something different to the...

08:19.400 --> 08:21.400
Yeah, I give up. Get him!

08:21.480 --> 08:24.720
Gentlemen,
take that sucker-covered sucker down!

08:24.800 --> 08:27.000
Erm... I'll just stay here then?

08:27.080 --> 08:29.080
(squid roars)

08:30.720 --> 08:32.280
Gah! I'm immobilised!

08:32.360 --> 08:35.160
Though I still retain
the power of...

08:37.360 --> 08:40.280
This all sounds very exciting.
Are we winning?

08:40.760 --> 08:43.200
What do we do when we get to it?
Huddle up.

08:43.280 --> 08:47.480
You fight it, while I cheer you
vigorously from a safe distance.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.240
I'm hit!

08:50.320 --> 08:53.520
Oh. Yeah, great.
Leave it all up to me. How typical.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.880
Erm, could someone spare a moment
and turn me around?

08:56.960 --> 08:58.360
And pick me up?

09:02.880 --> 09:04.840
Uh-oh

09:04.920 --> 09:07.560
(blows)

09:07.640 --> 09:09.680
(explosion)

09:09.760 --> 09:12.040
OK, Lemmy,
we're the last men standing.

09:12.120 --> 09:16.480
'Cept... we're not really men.
And you can't stand.

09:16.560 --> 09:20.880
Point is, we can get the drop on the
squid, but we gotta do this quiet.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.560
One wrong move could...
(yells)

09:23.640 --> 09:26.480
Have you busted the squidy yet?

09:26.560 --> 09:28.680
(squid roars)

09:28.760 --> 09:30.240
Nice job, Ringtail(!)

09:30.320 --> 09:35.360
Erm, this is more of that
idiot mode sarcasm, yes?Uh-oh.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.000
I blame yoooooooo...
Wha?!

09:38.080 --> 09:41.160
Lemmy! It's you! Sort of!

09:47.000 --> 09:49.200
(Skipper) Duck!

09:49.280 --> 09:51.560
Atta bot! Now use the Mantis Chop!

09:53.080 --> 09:57.480
No, no. Spin into a moonwalk...
or better yet, a Mars-walk!

10:00.120 --> 10:01.400
Serpent strike!

10:02.200 --> 10:03.880
Head slide!

10:03.960 --> 10:06.320
Monkey kick!

10:06.400 --> 10:08.520
Side step to corkscrew!

10:08.600 --> 10:11.200
Lotus lumbago!
Elbow airchair!

10:11.280 --> 10:12.600
Fist of fury!

10:13.960 --> 10:14.960
Open jazz hand.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.320
(all cheer)

10:22.400 --> 10:25.040
Erm, so we won then, did we?

10:26.440 --> 10:28.840
Soldier, I salute you, too.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.120
Or I would if I could.
It's the thought that counts, right?

10:32.200 --> 10:37.040
Yes, Lemmy, boogie
your little titanium feet off!

10:37.120 --> 10:38.280
I... Whoa!

10:41.800 --> 10:44.280
Will we ever see him again?

10:44.360 --> 10:46.920
Sure... once he's shown
those milksop Martians

10:47.000 --> 10:50.040
what we do to their kind here on
the good ol' US of Earth.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.880
Yeah. Hey, so, how long did you say
we're gonna be like this?

10:53.960 --> 10:57.120
A week or two?
Yes. I'm afraid so.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.280
OK, folks, if we start hopping
like tiny bunnies now,

11:00.360 --> 11:02.840
we should get back
to our habitats by Sunday.

11:02.920 --> 11:07.240
So... Move out! Tiny bunny!
Tiny bunny. Tiny bunny...

11:09.960 --> 11:12.040
Oof!
Tiny bunny.
