And swallow.

00:43.185 --> 00:44.732
That's it.

02:08.645 --> 02:10.364
'Your odd mountain.

02:10.481 --> 02:15.237
'Let's go up it together,
for old times' sake. Dad.'

02:26.914 --> 02:28.917
What have you done now?

02:31.961 --> 02:33.383
George?

02:38.092 --> 02:39.435
George?

03:38.068 --> 03:39.911
Hi, Mum.

03:43.282 --> 03:47.082
- Still not locking your door.
- Oh, sorry. I forgot.

03:47.953 --> 03:51.332
- You can take those away.
- You're not ready.

03:51.457 --> 03:54.677
This was in the middle of the road.
I almost hit it.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.765
I've already taken it!

04:05.804 --> 04:09.274
- What are you going to wear?
- I don't know.

04:12.353 --> 04:15.027
Take those boxes away.

04:17.983 --> 04:20.486
This diet is going to kill you.

04:50.307 --> 04:52.150
Come on, Mum.

05:22.631 --> 05:25.931
Hello, I'm Nancy. This is Edie.

05:26.051 --> 05:27.553
Mrs Moore.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.940
- How are you, Gordon?
- Good, thank you.

05:32.057 --> 05:37.154
# Everything bright and breezy
Do as you damn well pleasy... #

05:37.271 --> 05:40.320
Hear that, Mum?
You can do your gardening here.

05:41.442 --> 05:45.163
Oh, that's lovely. Maybe you
can move that one slightly forward.

05:45.279 --> 05:47.498
- That's where it was!
- I'm sorry, darling.

05:47.614 --> 05:50.584
You know what I'm like! That's perfection!

05:50.701 --> 05:53.250
Edie, I've got you some flowers.

05:54.621 --> 05:58.672
There we are.
Be careful of those. They're very sharp.

06:00.252 --> 06:06.225
See what's happening over here. Wow!
It's a fountain! Just like the picture.

06:17.561 --> 06:20.736
- I'll make us some tea.
- Oh, thank you.

07:15.911 --> 07:19.381
'Money is low.
Can only afford the nurse once a week.

07:20.791 --> 07:23.715
'My only escape is the cafÃ©.
That's my world now.

07:25.254 --> 07:27.052
'The house is a prison.

07:27.589 --> 07:32.846
'When I think of Dad, our adventures,
I find myself wanting to weep and shout...

07:33.845 --> 07:37.850
'Cleaning and caring, cleaning and caring.
That's all I seem to do in my life.

07:37.975 --> 07:40.023
'Having her would bring us closer together...

07:40.936 --> 07:43.280
'In fact, it did the opposite.

07:44.982 --> 07:48.532
'Sometimes, I want to get up
and leave her behind.'

07:54.825 --> 07:57.829
I asked you not to go through my things.

07:57.953 --> 08:01.924
Some of these are perfectly good.
That, for instance. And that!

08:02.040 --> 08:03.883
Don't just stand there, Nancy.

08:04.001 --> 08:06.174
- Sort it out.
- You sort it out.

08:07.170 --> 08:11.221
- Well, I am.
- What do you think? I like packing?

08:11.341 --> 08:14.060
I want to stare at your mouldy rubbish?

08:14.177 --> 08:16.896
You do it. I'm sick of doing things for you.

08:36.575 --> 08:37.996
Nancy...

08:39.244 --> 08:43.716
It was for myself.
It wasn't meant to be read.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.638
I had no one to talk to.

08:50.464 --> 08:52.717
Who was I supposed to talk to?

08:56.720 --> 08:58.597
Me, Mum.

08:58.722 --> 09:03.398
- You could've talked to me.
- No, you were too young to understand.

09:04.269 --> 09:09.776
Anyway, he hid it when
you were around, his rage.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.324
Nancy. Nancy.

09:12.444 --> 09:15.118
Darling, listen. Listen to me.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.786
It started before he was in his chair.

09:19.910 --> 09:24.040
He dictated where I went,
who I could talk to.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.713
If I wanted to buy something,
he'd say, "That's a waste of money.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.801
- "You don't need that!"
- I don't want to hear this.

09:28.919 --> 09:31.217
I couldn't do anything right.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.057
And if I answered back,
he'd say, "Don't upset the child.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.893
- "You mustn't upset the child."
- For God's sake!

09:41.640 --> 09:44.769
- Mum...
- I admit I didn't love him.

09:44.893 --> 09:48.272
But I looked after him and you.
I did my duty.

09:48.397 --> 09:49.944
Duty?

09:51.149 --> 09:53.994
Yes! For all those years.

09:54.111 --> 09:57.206
But that's all I did, nothing else!

09:57.322 --> 09:59.450
Don't you understand?

11:19.738 --> 11:22.787
- Ah, Edie. How are you?
- I'm fine, thanks.

11:22.908 --> 11:25.707
- Have a seat.
- The usual, please.

11:25.827 --> 11:27.670
No problem.

11:33.335 --> 11:38.387
- Am I too late for more chips?
- Never too late for you, Edie.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.123
- 'Hello, this is Nancy.'
- Nancy, I...

12:04.241 --> 12:07.511
'I'm not here right now, but please leave
a message and I'll get back to you.'

12:09.454 --> 12:14.711
Nancy? I'm letting you know
I'm going away for a few days.

12:22.259 --> 12:24.762
I'll call you back in a few days.

12:49.077 --> 12:51.546
'The Caledonian Sleeper service to Inverness

- Is she dead?
- She's not dead.

Are you all right?

15:11.886 --> 15:15.390
Oh, God! That is my train! I cannot
believe you have done this to me again.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.483
- You'll make it.
- You're standing on my business plan!

15:17.600 --> 15:19.398
- Fiona, it's fine.
- It's got a massive footprint on it.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.987
Fiona, you need to go, now!

15:21.104 --> 15:23.357
We can't just leave her here.
Are you all right, madam?

15:23.481 --> 15:25.358
Do I look all right?

15:25.483 --> 15:30.080
- We're really sorry about that.
- You should be arrested.

15:30.822 --> 15:33.621
- This is ridiculous.
- I have to go.

15:33.742 --> 15:35.745
- Let me help you.
- No.

15:37.871 --> 15:41.341
- Let me at least...
- No, don't touch anything!

15:41.458 --> 15:42.960
- Can I do something for you?
- No!

15:43.084 --> 15:46.509
- Maybe I can give you a lift.
- I'm getting a bus.

15:46.629 --> 15:49.474
- You're sure you're gonna be okay?
- Let me be.

16:15.492 --> 16:17.665
- I hope you're not waiting on the bus.
- Why?

16:17.786 --> 16:20.255
It'll be here all right,
but it's gonna be about four hours.

16:20.371 --> 16:24.001
- Can I give you a lift?
- No. You're wrong.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.879
Well, it's not like I live here,
but suit yourself.

16:29.214 --> 16:32.639
Erm... Wait. Wait.

16:42.310 --> 16:44.779
So should I at least get your name
or something?

16:44.896 --> 16:47.574
- Mrs Moore.
- Sorry?

16:49.317 --> 16:51.035
Edith Moore.

16:52.654 --> 16:54.076
Right.

17:45.582 --> 17:48.427
Is there a camping shop near here?

17:48.543 --> 17:50.671
I think so, yeah.

17:54.632 --> 17:57.431
You're not thinking about
going up Suilven, are you?

17:57.552 --> 17:59.395
Don't be ridiculous.

18:34.672 --> 18:36.140
This is you.

18:37.050 --> 18:38.802
Er... Oh, dear. I can't...

18:38.927 --> 18:40.746
Oh, you just wanna...

18:41.262 --> 18:44.311
- How do I...?
- Yeah, you just flip the handle up.

18:47.685 --> 18:49.938
- All right, there?
- Yes.

18:50.063 --> 18:51.485
Thank you.

18:55.485 --> 18:59.661
- All right, you take care now.
- Thank you.

19:25.515 --> 19:28.064
- Just a minute.
- Edith Moore.

19:28.184 --> 19:30.232
- There you are.
- Cheers!

19:33.273 --> 19:36.027
Oh, um... Edith Moore.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.243
You don't arrive till tomorrow.

19:42.031 --> 19:44.534
No, I arrive today.

19:44.659 --> 19:48.539
- It says tomorrow.
- I think I know when I arrive.

19:48.663 --> 19:51.382
- It's pretty easy to get dates mixed up.
- Oh, there we are!

19:51.499 --> 19:53.968
- How you doing, all right?
- Guys, I'll be with you in a sec.

19:54.085 --> 19:57.510
It may be easy for you,
but some of us have sharp minds.

19:57.630 --> 20:01.430
I'm really sorry. There's nothing I can do.
It's literally our busiest weekend.

20:01.551 --> 20:05.101
Rory, can you come back here,
please? And where's Louise?

20:05.221 --> 20:08.896
Don't worry about it.
There's plenty more places.

20:10.476 --> 20:11.978
Come on, then.

20:14.564 --> 20:15.907
Come on.

20:26.242 --> 20:29.792
- Can I have a room for tonight, please?
- Jonny, we're fully booked tonight.

20:29.912 --> 20:31.915
It's the fishing festival.
Every room is taken.

20:32.040 --> 20:36.295
Every room is full!
Why don't you try Mrs McCloud?

20:36.419 --> 20:39.468
'She may be full, aye.
She's been fixed for weeks.'

20:39.589 --> 20:41.842
There must be somewhere. She needs a bed.

20:41.966 --> 20:45.436
- I can't think of anywhere else.
- There must be somewhere.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.954
Sorry. It's never normally this messy.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.295
I will, er... I will get you fresh sheets.

21:10.411 --> 21:13.130
I'll be out of here
first thing in the morning.

21:14.123 --> 21:16.091
Oh, and I'll pay, of course.

21:16.209 --> 21:18.257
No, no. You don't have to worry about that.

21:18.378 --> 21:22.008
Bathroom is through there,
kitchen downstairs. Take what you need.

21:22.131 --> 21:24.930
And, yeah, sorry about the mess.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.054
Flatmate's a pain in the arse.

21:28.596 --> 21:30.018
Right.

22:27.405 --> 22:29.128
Christ! What...?

22:29.249 --> 22:32.828
McLaughlin! You need to change what
you're eating, mate! That's disgusting!

22:32.952 --> 22:35.580
Shh! Shut up! You're gonna waken her.

22:35.705 --> 22:37.127
Fiona?

22:38.416 --> 22:43.092
She has got your wee balls
in her little handbag, mate.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.554
You know what? You need to come out with us.

22:46.674 --> 22:48.927
No, no. I cannae. I'm broke.

22:49.051 --> 22:51.520
Aye. You're coming. Lads.

22:51.637 --> 22:52.855
Eh?

22:52.972 --> 22:56.977
- Hey, no! Oh, no, no, no!
- You're going to come out!

23:43.064 --> 23:46.034
'Good morning, good morning, good morning!

23:46.150 --> 23:50.201
'Thanks for tuning in this morning.
We've got an exciting show lined up.

23:50.321 --> 23:53.871
'Lots of music, lots of fun,
lots of interviews.

23:53.991 --> 23:57.461
'Welcome on this bright and sunny morning.

23:57.578 --> 23:59.421
'What a rarity that is.

23:59.539 --> 24:03.760
'But don't worry, I'm sure we'll get rain,
sleet and snow by the afternoon.

24:03.876 --> 24:07.150
'That's always the way, isn't it?
That's always the way...'

24:51.424 --> 24:55.099
I know. I know that's what I said to him.

24:59.181 --> 25:00.603
Hold on.

25:00.725 --> 25:04.025
I, um... I want to cancel my reservation.

25:04.145 --> 25:06.569
One second. Yeah...

25:17.074 --> 25:19.122
You wanted to cancel?

25:21.537 --> 25:22.880
No.

25:25.333 --> 25:28.462
I need a new buckle on my rucksack.

25:37.053 --> 25:38.646
Here we go...

25:38.763 --> 25:41.211
Oh, man, my head is thumping.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.435
Pay attention now.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.564
- You might just learn something here.
- Aye, that'll be right.

25:47.688 --> 25:49.156
Excuse me!

25:51.400 --> 25:53.323
- Watch what you're doing!
- Sorry.

25:53.444 --> 25:56.038
Sorry. It's yourself.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.498
Yes.

25:57.615 --> 26:01.620
- Everything all right? The hotel...?
- No, no. Everything's sorted.

26:02.870 --> 26:04.622
Thank you for last night.

26:06.499 --> 26:09.378
Now, I'm looking for a buckle.

26:09.502 --> 26:11.721
I don't think we've got buckles.

26:12.537 --> 26:13.805
I'll check for you.

26:15.549 --> 26:17.222
Clean that up.

26:21.389 --> 26:23.232
Hello? Highland... Hello, Fiona.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.568
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Everything's good.

26:25.685 --> 26:29.940
- I was just with a customer.
- So, you off to explore the area?

26:30.064 --> 26:33.568
No, I'm not really interested
in the area, just Suilven.

26:36.612 --> 26:42.119
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- I... I don't think so.

26:42.243 --> 26:44.291
I'll get you at the station? Yeah?

26:44.412 --> 26:47.291
All right. Okay. I love you, too. Bye.

26:48.624 --> 26:51.423
I'm still waiting for the buckle.

26:51.544 --> 26:52.966
Buckle.

26:55.506 --> 26:57.975
- Those aren't buckles.
- Well, that's all we have.

26:58.092 --> 27:00.720
So, why don't you glue your bag
or you can buy another one?

27:00.845 --> 27:04.475
Huh! I'm not going to buy a new bag
for a two-day hike.

27:04.598 --> 27:06.601
Oh, I'll have to make do with these.

27:06.726 --> 27:09.195
Right, now, I also need some gas.

27:09.311 --> 27:11.530
- Hold on a minute.
- Wow.

27:11.647 --> 27:14.150
Right. It's, er...

27:15.484 --> 27:18.488
It's one of these, look. Hold on.

27:18.612 --> 27:20.785
Oh, wow!

27:22.700 --> 27:24.077
Right.

27:25.428 --> 27:28.172
- Okay?
- That is quite something.

27:28.289 --> 27:32.089
- Yes, it's a good one.
- Burns solid fuel, does it?

27:32.209 --> 27:33.756
No, it burns gas.

27:33.878 --> 27:36.927
I hate those moments when you're
caught halfway up the mountainside

27:37.047 --> 27:40.597
and your entire family come around
and join you for a cup of tea.

27:40.718 --> 27:43.312
- Just the gas, please.
- Yup.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.227
And a small one.

27:45.347 --> 27:48.851
Small one. Smallest, meanest one we've got.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.743
Annoying, isn't he?

27:58.819 --> 28:02.540
But he does know his stuff about camping.

28:02.656 --> 28:06.744
Tell me this, if you were lost in the
wilderness, would you know how to light a fire?

28:06.869 --> 28:10.464
- Yes.
- Aye, but outside, though?

28:10.581 --> 28:12.629
- Yes, outside.
- Right, right.

28:12.750 --> 28:16.050
But Suilven?
Phew! That's one hell of a climb.

28:16.170 --> 28:17.922
I mean, a hell of a climb.

28:18.047 --> 28:20.971
Lots of walking. Lots of walking!
And then it's steep.

28:21.091 --> 28:24.470
One wrong move, you might not come back.

28:24.595 --> 28:27.098
I don't want to scare you,
but do you know how many people died

28:27.223 --> 28:31.319
up here last year in avalanches?
A lot of people.

28:31.435 --> 28:35.235
You see, the smart ones take someone
with experience up that mountain.

28:35.356 --> 28:38.986
- Who?
- He's the best we've got.

28:39.109 --> 28:41.362
Jonny's taken more people
up Suilven than I know.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.706
I don't need a guide.

28:43.823 --> 28:47.498
She doesn't need a guide.
4.20 for the gas, please.

28:48.494 --> 28:51.669
I can see yous two got off
on the wrong foot, but this is serious.

28:51.789 --> 28:53.757
Last year, on that mountain,
a young man died.

28:53.874 --> 28:56.878
- What man?
- The man. Who died.

28:57.002 --> 28:59.551
- Uh...
- How much does it cost?

28:59.672 --> 29:02.426
Well, a guide, four days' skills training...

29:02.550 --> 29:05.474
- Wait? Skills training?
- Skills training, yes.

29:05.594 --> 29:07.938
- Personal fitness coach.
- Fitness?

29:08.055 --> 29:09.773
Just 300 a day.

29:09.890 --> 29:13.235
- Oh, that's extortionate!
- Yes, but that's the deluxe, darling.

29:13.352 --> 29:16.697
- The standard's 250.
- No. No, thanks.

29:16.814 --> 29:19.533
Look, wait a minute.
We can sort something out.

29:19.650 --> 29:22.404
Let's say 200... and a free stove!

29:22.528 --> 29:25.156
- Whoa! Hey!
- Well, I have a stove.

29:25.281 --> 29:28.035
Yeah, but is it top of the range?

29:28.158 --> 29:32.789
- Worth 50 quid.
- Oh, right. Well...

29:32.913 --> 29:36.292
Look, you don't want to end up
on the mountain with a broken leg.

29:38.460 --> 29:39.712
Erm...

29:45.092 --> 29:46.810
Well, all right.

29:46.927 --> 29:49.772
But I'm not paying if I'm not happy.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.983
- And I'm keeping the stove.
- Of course.

29:52.099 --> 29:54.648
He'll pack it up for you, too,
won't you, mate?

29:55.769 --> 29:59.694
Thank you.
You've been very helpful, young man.

30:05.988 --> 30:10.619
Well done, mate. She just walked
away with a stove worth 150 quid.

30:10.743 --> 30:16.295
Aye. One go and she'll be straight
back in the shop. She's ancient.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.418
Bye, now.

30:24.465 --> 30:28.891
- You're getting 700 quid to do nothing.
- 700? I thought you said 800.

30:29.011 --> 30:31.230
Aye. And my commission.

30:31.347 --> 30:33.350
There she goes.

30:53.744 --> 30:57.874
Sorry, I had things to do at the shop.
Just making sure everything was...

30:57.998 --> 31:01.878
I'm paying a great deal of money
for this. You must be on time.

31:05.881 --> 31:09.431
- Hotel seems nice.
- Well, it's clean.

31:41.875 --> 31:45.846
- I think we'll start off nice and slow.
- Well, there's no need for that.

31:45.963 --> 31:49.183
You want to build yourself up,
get used to all this boggy ground.

31:49.299 --> 31:53.395
I hope we're not going to walk
all the time, just to use up the day.

31:53.512 --> 31:56.436
Because I paid for training!

31:56.557 --> 31:58.651
Yes, I know.

32:11.405 --> 32:13.954
You know, just down here
there's a stretch of road,

32:14.074 --> 32:16.452
and every March it's covered in toads.

32:16.577 --> 32:19.877
- Toads?
- Toads, yeah. Baby frogs, you know...

32:19.997 --> 32:22.250
I know what toads are!

32:23.125 --> 32:25.503
- Sorry, am I walking too fast for you?
- No.

32:25.627 --> 32:29.632
- I can slow down, that's no problem.
- It's fine.

32:31.008 --> 32:34.478
Anyway, they mate in March, these toads.

32:34.595 --> 32:38.600
And then, they go everywhere
and when they get close to the road...

32:38.724 --> 32:40.146
Oh!

32:40.267 --> 32:43.021
- You all right there?
- Yes, I'm fine.

32:43.812 --> 32:47.863
So the locals decided to help
the toads across the road.

32:47.983 --> 32:50.077
Why would anyone help toads?

32:52.196 --> 32:53.664
- Ooh.
- I don't know.

32:53.781 --> 32:55.579
Why would anyone help anyone?

32:57.117 --> 33:00.496
- You sure I can't help you?
- I just have to get...

33:05.959 --> 33:08.713
Do you want me to clean it for you as well?

33:08.837 --> 33:10.885
Well, it's the least you can do.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.559
Cranky old cow!

33:15.385 --> 33:17.809
Excuse me!

33:19.807 --> 33:21.184
Oh!

33:21.308 --> 33:25.404
- I hope you're not making it worse!
- Just relax, will you?

33:27.856 --> 33:29.324
Oh, sh...

33:29.441 --> 33:32.495
- Oh, no!
- Shite!

33:56.009 --> 33:59.809
I assume that'll be deducted from your fee.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.316
What fee?

34:14.610 --> 34:16.955
Look, I know how to use a stove.

34:17.697 --> 34:19.621
Okay, then. Show me.

34:29.083 --> 34:30.427
Just...

34:31.670 --> 34:34.014
Just be careful. Don't force it.

34:34.130 --> 34:36.007
Edie, you do that, you'll break it.

34:36.132 --> 34:37.429
Edie...

34:37.551 --> 34:39.393
Edie, just stop!

34:41.304 --> 34:42.931
Listen to me.

34:44.600 --> 34:47.695
Click, twist. Okay?

34:52.690 --> 34:54.989
Want to do the gas?

35:06.788 --> 35:08.791
Just be gentle.

35:12.794 --> 35:14.873
That wasn't so hard, was it?

35:18.342 --> 35:21.187
Would you say today had gone well?

35:26.391 --> 35:30.521
Handmade, double-stitched and watertight.

35:30.646 --> 35:35.243
- They'll last you a lifetime.
- Whose lifetime? Yours or mine?

35:36.735 --> 35:40.615
- So? What do you think?
- Well, not bad.

35:49.373 --> 35:53.879
Don't think you'll be needing all that.
That's the expensive stuff.

35:58.131 --> 36:02.432
We call it a base layer.
Keeps you dry, keeps the cold out.

36:02.552 --> 36:05.397
It's got holes in it!

36:05.514 --> 36:08.438
- Yeah. For your thumbs.
- Oh...

36:09.142 --> 36:11.019
That one'll keep you warm.

36:15.065 --> 36:18.194
- What's this for?
- Mountaineering.

36:18.318 --> 36:21.037
Well, isn't that what I'm doing?

36:21.154 --> 36:23.031
Er... No.

36:24.032 --> 36:26.456
How's your flexibility?

36:28.453 --> 36:30.672
Probably enough stretching for one day.

36:35.544 --> 36:37.672
And they protect your knees.

36:40.757 --> 36:42.805
Is this it?

36:42.926 --> 36:47.181
- Oh! I think it's rather a lot!
- No, I'm asking are you finished?

36:47.306 --> 36:49.934
Oh. Yes. Yes, I am.

36:50.058 --> 36:53.278
- So, er...
- Now, the price of the boots.

36:53.395 --> 36:56.114
Remember, that's deducted from your fee.

39:00.313 --> 39:03.032
There we go, Mount Suilven.

39:03.150 --> 39:07.280
So, this down here, this is the base.

39:07.404 --> 39:11.034
Between the base and the ridge,
that's the toughest part...

39:11.950 --> 39:13.793
Edie? Paying attention?

39:13.910 --> 39:16.254
- Yes, of course.
- You're not, are you?

39:16.371 --> 39:20.422
You're too busy paddling about.
This is serious.

39:20.542 --> 39:24.092
In a few days' time, you and I will be up
that mountain and you won't have a clue.

39:24.212 --> 39:27.432
Now, if I were you, I'd be doing
everything I can to get fit.

39:27.549 --> 39:31.179
If you'd rather be someplace else
or you want to go back home, be my guest.

39:31.303 --> 39:34.933
I've got plenty of other things
I could be doing right now.

39:44.184 --> 39:45.701
Why is there water?

39:45.817 --> 39:48.571
I thought it would be an idea
to row across the loch.

39:48.695 --> 39:51.369
- It's gonna save a lot of walking time.
- In a boat?

39:51.490 --> 39:55.245
In a boat, yes. But it's okay,
I can show you how.

39:55.368 --> 39:56.995
And what's that?

39:57.120 --> 39:59.043
Base camp.

39:59.164 --> 40:01.508
Base camp one, two and three.

40:01.625 --> 40:05.471
- We climb on the morning of the third.
- Three days?

40:05.587 --> 40:09.262
Or you'll run out of time. You don't want
to get caught up Suilven in the dark.

40:09.382 --> 40:10.884
Trust me.

40:12.969 --> 40:17.224
Edie, this is really hard. There's plenty
of other walks round here, nice scenery...

40:17.349 --> 40:19.852
I don't want to go on any other walks.

40:21.144 --> 40:22.521
Okay.

40:23.355 --> 40:25.278
Suilven it is.

40:28.026 --> 40:31.496
By the time you get beyond the ridge
at the top, a gradual climb,

40:31.613 --> 40:33.616
and then you're up.

40:35.283 --> 40:37.286
See the resemblance?

40:38.495 --> 40:41.340
No, the, um... The model's very helpful.

40:42.874 --> 40:45.343
- You think so?
- Mm.

40:46.461 --> 40:48.259
Just a bit of fun, really.

40:48.380 --> 40:53.682
Um... There's just one thing
that I don't quite understand.

40:53.802 --> 40:56.977
- Right...
- Here. This!

40:57.097 --> 41:01.148
- Ugh! Oh, I hate spiders!
- It isn't a spider. It's a crab.

41:02.102 --> 41:04.600
- Is it?
- My father used to do that.

41:05.483 --> 41:07.115
What? Give people crabs?

41:18.201 --> 41:21.421
Hey, by the way, don't forget yourself.

42:28.438 --> 42:30.532
- Careful, now.
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

42:31.483 --> 42:33.486
- Now you?
- Yeah.

42:47.791 --> 42:50.966
Okay, so... First things first.

42:51.086 --> 42:53.305
You want to just...

42:53.421 --> 42:56.345
You wanna keep enough distance
between your oars, you know?

42:56.466 --> 43:00.221
- You want it smooth.
- Yeah. I think you're digging a bit.

43:01.304 --> 43:04.274
- We'll just go this way.
- I see.

43:07.686 --> 43:11.236
- Have you done this before?
- Once or twice!

43:11.356 --> 43:13.734
Why didn't you say something?

43:19.989 --> 43:22.868
You're going the wrong way!

43:36.798 --> 43:39.142
I don't know how your dad
taught you anything.

43:39.259 --> 43:42.104
No, neither do I. I was a wild child.

43:43.972 --> 43:48.023
- Difficult to believe now.
- Not so much.

43:49.853 --> 43:53.153
We used to have such fun together, he and I.

43:53.273 --> 43:55.550
We went camping all the time.

43:59.446 --> 44:01.665
And then I got married.

44:04.951 --> 44:07.579
- Ooh, I'm sorry!
- Careful.

44:07.704 --> 44:11.334
You've got to be the worst
fisherwoman I have ever seen.

44:14.836 --> 44:16.554
Nice and easy.

44:17.756 --> 44:20.100
So, then did you travel
with your husband after that?

44:20.216 --> 44:21.889
Oh, no!

44:22.010 --> 44:24.684
George wasn't the travelling kind.

44:25.638 --> 44:29.689
Dad tried to visit,
but... George didn't think much of him.

44:30.643 --> 44:32.987
So we began to lose touch.

44:34.230 --> 44:37.734
Then Dad thought of an idea to tempt me.

44:38.943 --> 44:42.698
I, um... I showed him this picture,

44:42.822 --> 44:45.120
or a picture like it, in a book,

44:45.241 --> 44:47.118
because it's so odd.

44:47.243 --> 44:49.120
And then he sent me this postcard.

44:53.124 --> 44:58.506
"Your odd mountain. Let's go up it
together, for old times' sake. Dad."

44:59.047 --> 45:00.765
Yeah.

45:00.882 --> 45:03.306
I thought it was worth fighting for,

45:03.426 --> 45:06.521
so I stood up to George.

45:07.806 --> 45:10.935
On the first day, I argued.

45:11.059 --> 45:12.982
He couldn't believe it.

45:13.102 --> 45:15.947
And the next day, I wouldn't speak to him.

45:16.064 --> 45:18.613
And he was furious.

45:18.733 --> 45:20.986
And the next day,

45:21.110 --> 45:26.241
he had a blood clot
and he never walked or talked

45:26.366 --> 45:28.869
for 30 years until he died.

45:32.080 --> 45:34.879
And Dad died not long
after George had his stroke,

45:34.999 --> 45:37.047
so that was that, I never went.

45:38.920 --> 45:40.718
I'm sorry.

45:40.839 --> 45:42.512
Till now!

46:38.396 --> 46:40.774
You, er... You might wanna...

46:40.899 --> 46:43.027
You might wanna check
the weight on that thing.

46:43.151 --> 46:46.872
If I were you, I'd be putting up
my tent, not weighing mine.

46:46.988 --> 46:49.958
All right. Last tent up, cooks dinner.

46:50.992 --> 46:52.414
All right.

46:53.536 --> 46:56.130
- Wait till I say go.
- Well, go on then!

46:56.247 --> 46:57.965
- Hurry up!
- Cheat!

47:05.381 --> 47:06.599
Ready?

47:06.716 --> 47:07.934
Yes.

47:08.968 --> 47:09.844
Go!

47:43.252 --> 47:45.801
- That was rubbish!
- Oh, dear.

47:45.922 --> 47:49.176
Something's happened in the middle.
Never mind, I'll fix that later.

47:51.844 --> 47:56.896
- Ooh, you're looking a bit saggy there.
- I could say the same about you.

47:57.016 --> 47:58.814
I'll give you a clip round the ears.

48:00.895 --> 48:02.943
You wanna watch that!

48:06.484 --> 48:10.159
- Done!
- How did you manage that?

48:10.279 --> 48:14.304
Well, I'll just go and put my feet up
while you do the dinner.

48:24.127 --> 48:25.504
Whoa!

48:26.587 --> 48:31.684
I must get my hands on some of that flint.

48:37.432 --> 48:38.809
Oh.

48:39.434 --> 48:42.654
It is so lovely here.

48:44.397 --> 48:46.400
You should try living here.

48:48.484 --> 48:50.987
Not many people have a view like that.

48:51.112 --> 48:52.785
Like what?

48:52.905 --> 48:54.623
Of nothing?

48:55.658 --> 48:58.503
Not a lot to do around here
apart from get pissed and mess around.

48:58.619 --> 49:01.293
I understand. I was young once.

49:01.414 --> 49:03.132
Oh, yeah?

49:03.249 --> 49:05.172
A lot of fellas, were there?

49:06.377 --> 49:08.220
No...

49:08.337 --> 49:13.560
- I was a good country girl.
- Yeah, I know a few of them.

49:18.222 --> 49:20.395
I remember when this place used to be fun.

49:21.893 --> 49:26.239
Like when I didn't have to worry
about bills, profits, orders.

49:28.232 --> 49:30.530
She's not turned a profit yet this year.

49:32.195 --> 49:36.541
So, she's applying for this
massive loan, which, if we get...

49:37.909 --> 49:40.628
...it's gonna be 25 years
before we pay it back.

49:42.538 --> 49:44.632
25 years, Edie!

49:44.749 --> 49:46.922
And I can't even manage a phone bill.

49:48.252 --> 49:50.095
I have a phone bill.

49:50.213 --> 49:52.716
I make no calls and it goes up and up.

50:11.638 --> 50:14.450
Oh, that smells wonderful!

50:14.570 --> 50:16.948
- Come on, then. Give us your plate.
- Okay.

50:18.699 --> 50:21.327
- Try a little bit of that for starters.
- All right.

50:25.832 --> 50:30.258
Hmm, it's lovely! It's... burnt pepper?

50:30.378 --> 50:31.971
- Oh, good.
- Mm!

50:32.088 --> 50:36.013
Here, you might want to give that a go.
That'll put some hairs on your chest.

50:36.134 --> 50:39.513
- No, thank you.
- It's part of the course. You've got to.

50:39.637 --> 50:42.891
All right. Put a little bit in a cup for me.

50:43.215 --> 50:44.608
What cup?

50:46.227 --> 50:47.445
Okay.

50:47.562 --> 50:49.405
- Go on.
- Right...

50:53.734 --> 50:55.361
Oh, lord!

51:03.786 --> 51:06.585
- Ooh! That's nice.
- Yeah?

51:06.706 --> 51:09.380
- Good.
- Where did all the fish come from?

51:10.501 --> 51:13.926
I... I thought we should top it up
from the harbour.

51:14.755 --> 51:16.928
Which one is ours?

51:21.220 --> 51:23.223
That's pathetic!

51:25.224 --> 51:26.567
Oh, God!

51:26.684 --> 51:29.509
This is going to my head, I think!

51:42.408 --> 51:43.751
Goodnight.

51:45.786 --> 51:48.585
- You sure you don't want a drink?
- Oh, no. I need my bed.

51:48.706 --> 51:52.552
- Come on, Edie. You only live once.
- Yeah. Don't I know?

51:52.668 --> 51:54.671
I'll be here at nine.

52:27.703 --> 52:31.549
- Wow! Look at you.
- Huh.

52:31.666 --> 52:35.136
- If only I was a little bit older.
- Ooh, much older.

52:37.463 --> 52:39.887
- Shall we?
- Oh. Thank you, sir.

52:55.564 --> 52:56.986
What?

53:07.076 --> 53:08.794
World's best teacher?

53:10.997 --> 53:14.016
Is that your date, Jonny?
Does Fiona know you're out?

53:15.835 --> 53:20.932
Oh, don't mind them.
They're just figuring out who you are.

53:22.091 --> 53:25.311
Who your family are, what you're doing here.

53:26.304 --> 53:28.682
And if you're worth getting to know or not.

53:31.017 --> 53:33.065
That's how this little town works.

53:36.397 --> 53:38.866
I don't know why I'm still here.

53:40.276 --> 53:43.155
I should've got out a long time ago.

53:43.279 --> 53:47.079
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know...

53:47.199 --> 53:49.748
I'm so sorry. Bloody stock count took ages.

53:49.869 --> 53:51.792
What did I miss?

53:51.912 --> 53:53.539
Er... Hi.

53:53.664 --> 53:56.793
Er... Edie, this is Fiona.
Fiona, this is Edie.

53:56.917 --> 53:59.136
How are you feeling?

54:00.087 --> 54:02.966
What's this? "To the world's best teacher!"

54:03.090 --> 54:05.184
Aye, that'll be the day!

54:07.511 --> 54:09.684
How is the loan coming along?

54:09.805 --> 54:13.025
- Oh, you heard about that? Yeah.
- Yeah, I...

54:13.142 --> 54:15.566
Going well. Fingers crossed and touch wood.

54:15.686 --> 54:18.781
I mean, it would allow us
to really expand our range

54:18.898 --> 54:20.866
and compete with the big boys
down in Inverness.

54:20.983 --> 54:23.452
- There's a lot more people in Inverness.
- Yes.

54:23.569 --> 54:27.073
But a lot of people come up here to walk
and hike, like yourself, you know?

54:27.198 --> 54:29.617
I mean... Crap!

54:31.118 --> 54:33.587
It's Chris. I have to. I'm so sorry.

54:33.704 --> 54:35.297
Hi, Chris.

54:36.332 --> 54:40.257
Yes, I got the new layout.
Putting a blog on there...

54:44.090 --> 54:45.933
I'm sorry about that.

54:46.050 --> 54:48.348
- Fiona wanted to come and meet you.
- Oh!

54:48.469 --> 54:52.019
I see it's back,
the big board of directors, eh?

54:56.394 --> 55:00.649
So... how's my two
best buddies getting along?

55:00.773 --> 55:03.993
- What's this?
- Oh, it's just, um... Yeah.

55:05.111 --> 55:07.489
Here's to you and your dice
with death, my old friend.

55:07.613 --> 55:10.458
I'm not saying you're old now, but...

55:10.574 --> 55:13.043
you're really, really old.

55:13.160 --> 55:16.460
May you come back alive. In one piece.

55:27.299 --> 55:30.724
You should be able to swallow, old Jean.

55:36.642 --> 55:38.189
Another drink?

55:40.396 --> 55:42.399
- Come on, old bird?
- Where?

55:42.523 --> 55:44.696
Let's grind on the dancefloor.

55:44.817 --> 55:47.320
- Really, I... need to.
- Where you going?

55:48.696 --> 55:50.323
Excuse me.

55:53.742 --> 55:55.244
Oh, dear.

56:03.586 --> 56:05.384
She's out of her mind!

56:22.813 --> 56:25.362
- I'm just trying to help her out.
- Course you're trying to help her.

56:25.483 --> 56:28.362
- You're romantic, Jonny.
- Don't be disgusting!

56:28.486 --> 56:31.160
I seem to remember this was your idea.

56:31.280 --> 56:33.749
She's gonna give us 800 quid.

56:33.866 --> 56:35.869
She's an old bag!

56:38.871 --> 56:42.842
Time for that dance, old Jean!
Come on! Come on now!

56:44.271 --> 56:45.681
Edie!

56:47.755 --> 56:49.974
- Is she all right?
- Edie?

57:15.574 --> 57:18.077
Can you just stay still?
You're driving me mad.

57:19.102 --> 57:22.357
Sorry. Why is this taking so long?

57:23.123 --> 57:24.700
I...

57:25.960 --> 57:28.088
Hi, there. Hi.

57:29.838 --> 57:32.466
Um... So? Is she okay?

57:32.591 --> 57:35.094
She's probably just slightly run-down,

57:35.219 --> 57:38.223
but I told her to rest up
and we'll check in a few days.

57:38.347 --> 57:40.350
Okay. Thank you.

57:48.399 --> 57:50.402
You've helped her a lot.

57:51.735 --> 57:54.659
A bit of dancing and she's half dead.
What will she be like on the mountain?

57:54.780 --> 57:56.327
It'll kill her.

57:56.448 --> 58:00.373
I don't know, Jonny.
It's... really not a good idea.

58:00.494 --> 58:04.294
You might be going with her, but how
will you feel if something goes wrong?

58:05.541 --> 58:10.388
If you want to help her,
the best thing is to take her home.

58:10.504 --> 58:14.555
Before something awful happens
and you have to live with that guilt.

58:53.505 --> 58:55.223
Edie?

58:56.467 --> 58:58.310
Just a minute.

59:51.980 --> 59:55.280
- I don't want that.
- That's the arrangement.

59:56.151 --> 01:00:00.452
Oh, and I'm leaving you the climbing
stuff. I won't have much use for that.

01:00:00.572 --> 01:00:03.246
Look, Edie, I'm not taking your money.

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:05.165
Well, it's done. Just let it be.

01:00:05.285 --> 01:00:07.629
No, it's not done! You've not climbed
the mountain, so I don't want it.

01:00:07.746 --> 01:00:09.544
Just take the money and let it be.

01:00:09.665 --> 01:00:11.633
You just want to quit
because you think that's easier,

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:13.673
so you don't have
to tell people you've failed.

01:00:13.794 --> 01:00:17.048
You want me to carry on so you don't
feel guilty about taking the money.

01:00:17.172 --> 01:00:19.049
This has got nothing to do with your money!

01:00:19.174 --> 01:00:22.019
It's too late! I'm not able to do it.

01:00:22.136 --> 01:00:25.265
I'm tired, I'm exhausted.
I'm too fucking old!

01:00:25.389 --> 01:00:27.141
I'm sorry. Language.

01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:30.944
Look, if you knew from the start
I wasn't going to do it,

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:34.531
why did you lead me to believe
that it was possible?

01:00:40.571 --> 01:00:42.494
- Get out.
- Why?

01:00:44.908 --> 01:00:47.081
What are you doing?

01:00:49.663 --> 01:00:51.961
- Get out the car, Edie.
- No!

01:00:52.082 --> 01:00:55.507
What...? What...? What are you doing?

01:00:55.627 --> 01:00:57.379
Jonny?

01:01:04.511 --> 01:01:08.266
You wanted to quit? Off you go.
Station's down that way.

01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:10.563
Enjoy your trip home.

01:01:10.684 --> 01:01:12.561
You can't leave me here!

01:01:12.686 --> 01:01:14.279
Jonny!

01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:18.697
Jonny! You've got my bag in the back!

01:01:21.361 --> 01:01:24.865
Oh... for heaven's sake!

01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:21.722
- You're slower than I thought!
- Oh! Leave me alone!

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:24.137
I'm geriatric!

01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:28.517
Wa-hoo!

01:02:31.098 --> 01:02:32.850
Wa-hay!

01:02:41.066 --> 01:02:43.539
Beaten by an old bag!

01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:54.167
You can do this. I know you can.

01:02:55.747 --> 01:02:57.420
Edie, come on.

01:02:58.876 --> 01:03:01.971
I can't bear any more disappointment.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:09.269
It is true. I only helped you for the money.

01:03:11.597 --> 01:03:13.144
I'm sorry.

01:03:15.642 --> 01:03:19.442
At first, I just thought
you were this cranky old cow.

01:03:19.563 --> 01:03:22.362
In actual fact, you are a cranky old cow.

01:03:23.984 --> 01:03:28.410
Then I got to know you and I realised
you're a good person to have around.

01:03:29.489 --> 01:03:34.416
And what you're doing up here...
it's kind of inspiring.

01:03:37.581 --> 01:03:41.962
So... look at what you've done on the bike.

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:44.797
You're ready.

01:04:05.192 --> 01:04:06.819
There we go.

01:04:25.337 --> 01:04:28.011
You shouldn't be worried
about anything, Edie.

01:04:28.131 --> 01:04:29.724
You won't be on your own.

01:04:29.841 --> 01:04:31.764
I can help you with your tent,
get that up for you.

01:04:31.885 --> 01:04:33.888
Help you with the stove.

01:04:34.846 --> 01:04:37.395
I can cook.
You'll have your own personal chef.

01:04:37.516 --> 01:04:41.396
How about that, eh?
And I'll help with the rowing.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:44.740
However, I may need your tips along the way.

01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:50.204
But don't worry, I'll get you up there.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.290
- In no time at all.
- Yeah.

01:05:26.064 --> 01:05:28.408
Jonny, I've made a decision.

01:05:28.525 --> 01:05:31.654
- I'm going up on my own.
- What do you mean?

01:05:31.778 --> 01:05:36.159
You see, you leading and doing everything,
that wasn't why I came here.

01:05:36.283 --> 01:05:40.538
- I must do it by myself, alone.
- No, Edie.

01:05:40.662 --> 01:05:43.507
- I don't mind. I want to come with you.
- No!

01:05:43.623 --> 01:05:45.921
So, what? You want me just to go home?

01:05:46.043 --> 01:05:48.262
- Yes, I'm sorry.
- What if something happens?

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:51.598
- What if you fall?
- You're the one that got me to do it!

01:05:51.715 --> 01:05:57.017
- Because I thought I was coming with you.
- I either go on my own or I go home!

01:05:58.055 --> 01:05:59.477
Fine.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:03.853
- I think you'd better take that back.
- No, that's yours.

01:06:03.977 --> 01:06:05.775
- I don't want it any more.
- Why?

01:06:05.896 --> 01:06:07.899
Because you're not going up?

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:11.568
No, Edie, because you're my friend.

01:06:13.195 --> 01:06:16.449
Thank you, but you've already earnt it.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:27.335
- I can carry that!
- I know you can carry your bag.

01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:37.018
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:41.398
Thank you.

01:06:51.316 --> 01:06:54.161
Now... see you soon.

01:06:54.277 --> 01:06:55.620
Okay.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.078
Good luck.

01:07:03.995 --> 01:07:05.167
Edie!

01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:12.258
- I want you to take this.
- No, I don't understand how they work.

01:07:12.379 --> 01:07:16.760
It's very simple. I'll call you.
You press the green button, okay?

01:07:16.883 --> 01:07:18.305
Okay.

01:09:38.483 --> 01:09:41.077
Oh! I can manage. I can do it.

01:09:41.194 --> 01:09:42.992
Oh! Okay. I'm...

01:09:43.113 --> 01:09:45.707
I'm sorry. I just thought you needed help.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.127
Well, thank you.

01:09:52.122 --> 01:09:53.795
Are you going over?

01:09:53.915 --> 01:09:56.464
Me? No. No, I've just come all the way down.

01:09:59.421 --> 01:10:02.641
So what about you? Are you fishing?

01:10:02.757 --> 01:10:07.103
- No, I'm going up there.
- Ooh... okay.

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.517
Wow!

01:10:14.519 --> 01:10:19.116
Erm... You know, I haven't seen
anyone else around.

01:10:19.232 --> 01:10:21.360
Does someone know you are here?

01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:25.034
Yes. I'll be all right.

01:10:25.989 --> 01:10:27.332
Okay.

01:10:29.868 --> 01:10:31.290
Well, then...

01:10:32.871 --> 01:10:35.465
- <i>Viel GIÃ¼ck.</i>
- Thank you.

01:13:24.584 --> 01:13:28.179
# I'll take the high road

01:13:28.296 --> 01:13:31.721
# And you'll take the low road

01:13:33.134 --> 01:13:37.765
# I'll be in Scotland afore ye... #

01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:15.928
- Hello?
- 'Edie? How's it going?'

01:14:16.052 --> 01:14:18.521
- What?
- 'How is it going?'

01:14:18.638 --> 01:14:20.515
- Oh, Jonny!
- 'Yeah.'

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.314
Oh, fine. I'm in the tent already.

01:14:23.434 --> 01:14:26.438
Oh, good. That's great.
So, how did the first day go?

01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:30.193
- 'Very good. No problems.'
- Really? You got across okay?

01:14:30.316 --> 01:14:32.034
- Er... Yes.
- 'The rowing went all right?'

01:14:32.151 --> 01:14:34.950
Look, no need to shout! I can hear you!

01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:38.075
Okay. Well, you sound like
you're doing all right, then.

01:14:38.199 --> 01:14:40.418
'Yes. It's very exciting.'

01:14:40.535 --> 01:14:43.414
Good. I just want to make sure
you take your time, don't overdo it.

01:14:43.538 --> 01:14:47.338
- 'And in stages, like we said.'
- Yes. I know. I will.

01:14:47.458 --> 01:14:50.132
'Okay. Erm... Well, be careful.'

01:14:50.253 --> 01:14:52.256
I'll call you again tomorrow.

01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:54.849
- Goodnight.
- 'Night, Edie.'

01:17:32.665 --> 01:17:37.912
Here's to the best, and soon to be
the biggest, camping shop in Scotland.

01:17:42.675 --> 01:17:45.394
- And Jonny!
- Jonny!

01:18:30.264 --> 01:18:33.313
Well done, Jonny, mate. Well done.

01:18:34.477 --> 01:18:37.196
- Cheers.
- The big entrepreneur, eh?

01:18:37.313 --> 01:18:39.737
Suppose you'll be moving out next.

01:18:39.857 --> 01:18:42.155
Yeah, I suppose I will.

01:19:15.184 --> 01:19:18.734
Jonny, where are you? You could
at least say thank you to Mum and Dad.

01:19:18.855 --> 01:19:21.984
'Hello? Jonny?'

01:19:22.108 --> 01:19:24.782
- What?
- 'I can't hear you.'

01:19:24.902 --> 01:19:26.779
'Hello?'

01:19:43.796 --> 01:19:45.469
No!

01:20:06.485 --> 01:20:08.283
What the hell are you doing?

01:20:08.404 --> 01:20:10.577
You're going up to see her?
She's in the middle of a storm?

01:20:10.698 --> 01:20:13.747
- You really want to do this right now?
- You let her climb on her own!

01:20:13.868 --> 01:20:16.371
- Why do you treat me like an idiot?
- I don't!

01:20:16.495 --> 01:20:21.046
I'm just tired of fixing your messes
while all you do is think about yourself.

01:20:21.167 --> 01:20:23.295
- You've ruined the whole night!
- I've ruined your night?

01:20:23.419 --> 01:20:26.047
I'm sorry I've ruined your night.
You gonna take it out my wages?

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.433
I'm gonna go inside,

01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:33.771
because there's people there who actually
believe in what I am managing to do.

01:20:35.389 --> 01:20:36.766
Fiona!

01:20:38.768 --> 01:20:41.817
I believe in what you're trying to do.

01:20:41.938 --> 01:20:43.986
I just really need to do this.

01:20:46.525 --> 01:20:47.947
Do it.

01:23:55.297 --> 01:23:57.174
'This is Jonny. Sorry...'

01:25:33.979 --> 01:25:36.778
Oh... Thank you.

01:31:05.978 --> 01:31:07.525
Edie!

01:31:09.273 --> 01:31:10.946
Edie!

01:31:58.697 --> 01:31:59.994
Edie...

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:11.797
Edie.

01:32:12.628 --> 01:32:15.677
- Boo.
- Oh, thank God, Edie.

01:32:19.009 --> 01:32:22.058
I'm so sorry, Edie. I should never
have let you up here on your own.

01:32:22.179 --> 01:32:26.025
Oh! I've been so afraid.

01:32:27.601 --> 01:32:29.569
It's okay. You're all right.

01:32:30.436 --> 01:32:32.109
You've done so well.

01:32:35.567 --> 01:32:37.615
- Water?
- Oh, yes, please.

01:32:39.529 --> 01:32:41.497
Please. Oh!

01:32:47.204 --> 01:32:49.002
Oh, I needed that.

01:32:49.122 --> 01:32:51.216
- Better?
- Oh, yes.

01:32:52.834 --> 01:32:55.212
Am I close?

01:32:55.337 --> 01:32:57.431
Really, really close.

01:32:57.547 --> 01:33:00.551
It was just a gradual slope up, that was all.

01:33:02.552 --> 01:33:04.850
How are your feet?

01:33:04.971 --> 01:33:07.224
They've been better.

01:33:09.768 --> 01:33:11.987
This isn't quitting, you know.

01:33:12.979 --> 01:33:15.277
You've given it everything you've got, Edie.

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.494
- That's all you can do.
- I can't go back.

01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:20.408
Please, Edie. You're not going
to make it up there.

01:33:20.529 --> 01:33:23.533
No, I have to try.
You said it was a gradual slope.

01:33:23.657 --> 01:33:27.503
- Yeah, well, I'm full of shit.
- Yes, you are full of shit!

01:33:28.453 --> 01:33:32.174
You don't know half the things
that you say you know.

01:33:35.794 --> 01:33:40.721
The past few days, I've been
the happiest I've been since...

01:33:42.676 --> 01:33:44.679
I can't think when.

01:33:47.556 --> 01:33:51.857
- You remember I said I was a wild child?
- Yeah.

01:33:53.061 --> 01:33:55.860
I don't think I've been happy since then.

01:33:57.774 --> 01:33:59.242
Not really.

01:34:01.945 --> 01:34:04.164
I've lived a whole life.

01:34:05.907 --> 01:34:08.877
And most of it I would change if I could.

01:34:12.706 --> 01:34:16.882
And that's not meant to go like that.

01:34:17.002 --> 01:34:19.847
Oh, don't let that happen to you.

01:34:21.006 --> 01:34:22.849
Edie, please listen to me...

01:34:22.966 --> 01:34:27.847
I've wasted so much time doing nothing!

01:34:29.097 --> 01:34:31.725
I can't give this up now.

01:34:39.441 --> 01:34:40.784
Okay.

01:34:43.069 --> 01:34:45.037
All right.

01:34:45.155 --> 01:34:47.704
I'm gonna get you up that mountain.

01:34:49.075 --> 01:34:50.202
Okay.

01:34:50.994 --> 01:34:52.997
Ooh... my knee.

01:34:53.121 --> 01:34:54.998
- Let me take you.
- Thank you.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.378
- Okay.
- Come on, you've got this.

01:34:59.503 --> 01:35:01.972
- Look at me.
- Yes...
