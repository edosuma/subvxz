WEBVTT

01:02.495 --> 01:03.363
Jin Yu-jin.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.331
-Yes?
-Come.

01:05.698 --> 01:07.834
I'm not settling.
Tell them we'll do this by the law.

01:08.268 --> 01:09.903
Your settlement payment has been made.

01:12.639 --> 01:14.707
Don't get into any more trouble.

01:14.974 --> 01:18.978
What teacher these days covers
his student's ten-million-won settlement?

01:21.481 --> 01:23.049
-Hey.
-What did you do?

01:26.286 --> 01:27.587
Don't glare at me.

01:28.154 --> 01:30.156
What are you so proud of?
You were in a holding cell.

01:30.223 --> 01:32.292
Now stop glaring and eat your tofu.

01:33.159 --> 01:35.161
Why did you settle on my behalf?

01:35.228 --> 01:37.130
Right? It's crazy, isn't it?

01:37.330 --> 01:39.332
Where are your parents?
Why can't I get in touch?

01:39.766 --> 01:41.801
-Principal Ju.
-Here. Have this.

01:43.036 --> 01:46.072
You don't want to eat it?
Do you want to go back in?

01:46.372 --> 01:47.307
Darn it.

01:48.741 --> 01:51.377
I'll get money from those jerks
and pay you back.

01:51.578 --> 01:54.080
Stop being a dolt. Get money from them?

01:54.714 --> 01:56.616
Ten million won is a lot of money.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.854
Why are you being nice to me?
What's gotten into you?

02:05.558 --> 02:06.459
Hey, delinquent.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.062
To me, you're now a delinquent borrower.
Got it?

02:09.629 --> 02:11.331
If you can't repair your credit,

02:11.564 --> 02:13.566
I will find your parents

02:13.633 --> 02:16.769
and make them pay me back
at a loan shark interest rate.

02:17.003 --> 02:19.639
Are you engaging in usury with a student?

02:21.040 --> 02:25.311
To repair your credit,
you must pass this month's evaluation.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.213
If you don't pass, you're done for.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.049
-Got it?
-Darn it.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.254
This is so embarrassing.

02:36.623 --> 02:39.225
Look, I got you out.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.694
You should get down on your knees
and beg me for forgiveness.

02:41.928 --> 02:42.962
Learn some manners.

02:43.763 --> 02:45.331
Ten million won is a lot of money.

02:45.765 --> 02:47.600
I'm not a philanthropist.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.602
How can helping someone be so unrewarding?

02:50.837 --> 02:52.071
Go back to school right away!

02:53.506 --> 02:55.241
This is so embarrassing.

02:56.976 --> 02:58.678
What does he want from me?

03:22.835 --> 03:24.337
Let's do the duet together.

03:26.239 --> 03:27.073
What?

03:31.044 --> 03:31.978
Let's do it together.

03:33.479 --> 03:34.714
What are you scheming?

03:36.082 --> 03:38.084
You don't think I'm good enough.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.287
I want to see how great you are.

03:42.755 --> 03:43.623
Forget about it.

03:46.492 --> 03:48.294
You haven't found a partner yet, have you?

03:49.729 --> 03:51.598
You're in no position to play hardball.

03:55.034 --> 03:57.637
Plus, I would feel more comfortable
pairing up with you

03:58.638 --> 03:59.906
than someone I don't know at all.

04:02.609 --> 04:03.443
Let's do it.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.288
You weaseled your way out with money.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.659
Give them what they want.

04:20.326 --> 04:21.327
They're relentless.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.896
You know why I got into that fight
in the first place.

04:23.963 --> 04:25.098
Who asked you to butt in?

04:25.999 --> 04:26.833
What?

04:26.899 --> 04:28.768
Do you not have the money?

04:29.969 --> 04:32.605
If that's the case, let me know.
I can lend you the money.

04:34.874 --> 04:38.011
You worthless scumbag.
You're such a coward!

04:48.121 --> 04:50.556
Did you think I would hold out like you
just to prove my innocence?

04:52.258 --> 04:55.061
You must keep forgetting
because we're in the same school,

04:57.163 --> 04:58.264
but I'm a celebrity.

04:59.232 --> 05:02.101
Why would I, in my sane mind,
waste my time on an assault case?

05:03.870 --> 05:04.871
Are you two fighting?

05:10.043 --> 05:12.045
-Are you fighting?
-No.

05:14.013 --> 05:15.381
Yes, you were.

05:16.749 --> 05:18.751
Since you're not on good terms,

05:19.686 --> 05:22.855
how about you two pair up
for the monthly evaluation?

05:23.289 --> 05:25.124
-Mr. Lee!
-Are you out of your mind?

05:27.026 --> 05:31.197
Be thankful you can participate
despite being suspended.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.501
Don't fight, okay?

05:53.453 --> 05:54.821
What's your decision?

05:58.124 --> 05:59.692
Are you doing the duet with me or not?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.107
Hey, don't run.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.475
Why are you running?

06:19.946 --> 06:23.783
-Thanks for the hard work, Principal Ju.
-Hello, Mr. Lee.

06:24.050 --> 06:24.984
I'll see you around, then.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.819
Were you able to put out the fire?

06:32.091 --> 06:35.661
Thanks, Gang-cheol.
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.397
I told you it's not necessary.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.866
I can do that much for you.

06:40.099 --> 06:42.034
That's true. Way back, you did...

06:42.869 --> 06:45.838
In any case, I'll take the stacks.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.741
What's with the slang?

06:50.276 --> 06:51.644
So, what happened?

06:52.044 --> 06:54.046
Is it something that your wife
shouldn't know about?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.150
I can't tell you.

06:57.683 --> 06:58.718
Fine, then.

06:59.285 --> 07:00.186
I'll go now.

07:00.553 --> 07:03.790
Oh, shouldn't the staff go out
for dinner and drinks together?

07:04.023 --> 07:06.292
That sounds great. Thank you, Mr. Lee.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.000
No public displays of affection.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.735
No dating.

07:17.036 --> 07:18.671
What don't you understand
about the word "no"?

07:21.941 --> 07:22.842
Being in love...

07:24.043 --> 07:25.378
is not a sin.

07:26.446 --> 07:31.083
Don't you think disciplinary action
is a bit harsh?

07:31.851 --> 07:34.887
If you want to date,
transfer to another school.

07:35.321 --> 07:38.090
If you don't like the rules,
you're welcome to leave.

07:38.157 --> 07:42.161
How can she be so cold?
It must be the spinster in her.

07:43.529 --> 07:44.497
Seriously.

07:44.564 --> 07:47.500
It's hard to believe that she used to be
in the group Cream Puff.

07:47.900 --> 07:51.504
For women, every passing year
must wreak havoc on their personalities.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.340
She's so icy cold.

07:54.907 --> 07:57.109
Some women are immune
to the passage of time.

07:58.277 --> 08:02.582
She was the odd one out
even in her Cream Puff days.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.184
The other members
were like fluffy cotton candy,

08:05.251 --> 08:07.820
but she was always hard
like a sugar cube, right?

08:13.926 --> 08:17.997
I now have a partner
for the monthly evaluation.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.332
You do?

08:20.366 --> 08:21.434
Who?

08:22.568 --> 08:23.536
Rian.

08:24.704 --> 08:25.605
Rian?

08:27.573 --> 08:30.877
Rian said yes?
It's not just your wishful thinking?

08:31.344 --> 08:34.046
She asked me first.

08:34.647 --> 08:35.481
Really?

08:35.748 --> 08:37.817
Then I can be your team's mentor.

08:37.884 --> 08:40.753
Tell Rian I'm your mentor.

08:43.589 --> 08:45.858
JB teamed up with Yu-jin?

08:51.931 --> 08:54.934
I'll be in charge of that team.

08:56.135 --> 08:58.905
How odd. You're an English teacher.

08:59.305 --> 09:02.808
I've been here long enough to be a mentor.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.112
I first came to Kirin in--

09:06.178 --> 09:07.813
Would you like to be
JB and Yu-jin's mentor?

09:11.250 --> 09:13.953
Tell JB I'm mentoring his team.

09:14.954 --> 09:17.189
Follow me. I'll find you a song.

09:25.831 --> 09:27.700
The teams are all set now.

09:31.604 --> 09:32.738
Wait. There are two left.

09:33.205 --> 09:38.678
PARK SUN-DONG AND AILEE

09:59.365 --> 10:01.167
"Make room in your mouth."

10:08.874 --> 10:10.076
Should we divide up...

10:16.749 --> 10:17.583
Na-na.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.318
Let me help you with that.

10:36.769 --> 10:38.304
Does he expect me to sing and dance?

10:42.141 --> 10:43.676
If you can't repair your credit,

10:43.743 --> 10:45.911
I will find your parents

10:45.978 --> 10:48.681
and make them pay me back
at a loan shark interest rate.

10:49.882 --> 10:54.120
To repair your credit,
you must pass this month's evaluation.

10:54.186 --> 10:55.921
If you don't pass, you're done for.

11:00.259 --> 11:02.194
Why did he pay the ten million won?

11:03.295 --> 11:05.064
What does he really want from me?

11:07.166 --> 11:08.567
This place used to be run

11:08.634 --> 11:10.936
by the late Principal Ju
who is known as Principal Fried Chicken.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.272
He secretly provided
financial aid to students

11:13.339 --> 11:15.207
with the money he made
by selling fried chicken.

11:15.274 --> 11:18.110
This only came to light after his passing.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.246
I...

11:22.281 --> 11:24.116
didn't know how much he cared for us.

11:27.119 --> 11:30.022
Principal Ju!

11:32.191 --> 11:33.192
No way.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.396
Well...

11:37.763 --> 11:40.766
he could be a somewhat decent guy...

11:42.134 --> 11:43.369
I just don't know.

11:49.175 --> 11:50.710
Can you get up for a second?

11:55.915 --> 11:57.016
What?

11:57.683 --> 11:59.085
We need to divide up the parts.

11:59.151 --> 12:01.187
-We shouldn't procrastinate--
-Give me a pen.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.595
I'll do this,

12:09.862 --> 12:11.363
you do the harmony here.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.466
You do here and here,

12:13.899 --> 12:15.234
and I'll do the rest.

12:16.035 --> 12:16.936
Are we good?

12:21.841 --> 12:24.643
What was all that?
You took all the good parts.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.078
Can you sing those parts?

12:26.145 --> 12:28.047
Whatever you can do,
I can do just as well.

12:28.881 --> 12:31.183
Part A over here
and these eight measures--

12:31.250 --> 12:32.251
Don't be stubborn.

12:32.451 --> 12:35.054
We should split the parts fairly.
This is a duet, after all.

12:35.121 --> 12:37.156
A backing vocalist's role
is as important as the main one.

12:37.223 --> 12:39.525
You might say that since you were
a backing vocalist in your group

12:39.592 --> 12:40.593
but I don't want to be...

12:45.931 --> 12:50.035
What I'm saying is, since this is a duet,
we should both...

12:51.403 --> 12:52.438
Do whatever you want.

13:04.550 --> 13:07.119
You come this way. Clean here.

13:09.288 --> 13:13.025
For someone who's suspended,
you're showing no signs of remorse.

13:14.026 --> 13:17.429
-Look at your face. When others see you--
-Mr. Yang Jin-man?

13:19.565 --> 13:21.367
Have you ever danced?

13:25.404 --> 13:27.606
The evaluation is right around the corner,

13:27.673 --> 13:31.177
but many of you have two left feet.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.213
Dancing is not moving however you want to.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.581
That's writhing.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.051
When it comes to dancing,

13:39.752 --> 13:42.688
every move counts,
and therefore it has to be precise.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.292
Can you do that right away?

13:48.460 --> 13:51.897
How many times did you fall down
before you learned to walk?

13:53.365 --> 13:54.433
Around 2,000 times?

13:55.668 --> 14:00.272
You have to fall 2,000 times
just to learn how to walk.

14:01.307 --> 14:04.810
So, there's no way you can become dancers
with a few days of training.

14:07.580 --> 14:11.717
But luckily, you'll be in pairs.

14:16.388 --> 14:17.523
What a shame.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.726
Long arms, long legs...

14:21.126 --> 14:22.928
You have all the features
to become a great dancer.

14:26.665 --> 14:27.800
Can you do this?

14:31.604 --> 14:33.639
You must have gone clubbing
back in the day.

14:37.610 --> 14:38.911
Keep doing this.

14:43.983 --> 14:46.252
All you have to do
is keep repeating this move.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.790
Watch how I make up
for Mr. Yang's lack of dancing skills.

15:30.629 --> 15:33.132
Not bad, Sugar cube.

15:54.019 --> 15:55.120
See?

15:56.288 --> 15:58.791
Even if your partner
knows nothing about dancing,

16:00.125 --> 16:01.660
you can make up for it

16:01.727 --> 16:04.163
and make both of you
seem like good dancers.

16:07.566 --> 16:09.134
Do you plan to stay here all day?

16:15.040 --> 16:16.809
The worst dancer

16:17.977 --> 16:19.278
and the best dancer,

16:20.746 --> 16:21.580
come on out.

16:21.947 --> 16:22.848
Sure.

16:27.119 --> 16:28.454
My goodness.

16:32.925 --> 16:33.959
You know what to do, right?

16:39.331 --> 16:40.299
Do it.

17:13.265 --> 17:14.199
Oh, my gosh.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.705
This must be what winning the lottery
feels like.

17:56.241 --> 17:59.878
I should have filmed that
and pass it down as an heirloom.

17:59.945 --> 18:02.981
How can you be so lucky?
I am so jealous of you.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.453
I can't do what JB did.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.589
You said you didn't want to support me.

18:11.457 --> 18:13.292
I don't want to do that for you either.

18:13.959 --> 18:14.893
Don't worry.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.763
I can sing and dance for my part
all on my own.

18:20.165 --> 18:21.900
With your granny dance moves?

18:24.503 --> 18:25.904
Fight.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.273
My partner and I are sure to win.

18:31.510 --> 18:33.512
You were out of breath just by dancing.

18:33.979 --> 18:35.547
Are you sure you can sing while you dance?

18:35.848 --> 18:37.516
I'm practicing holding my breath.

18:37.850 --> 18:41.787
Why don't you try blowing up
a million balloons instead?

18:42.521 --> 18:45.591
Will that help increase my lung capacity?

18:56.268 --> 18:57.236
Hi, Dad.

18:57.703 --> 18:59.138
I'm at school, so...

19:01.607 --> 19:02.508
Mom did what?

19:03.308 --> 19:04.643
Hi, girls.

19:10.682 --> 19:12.017
When is she meeting with them?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.188
Why is she doing this to me?

19:16.955 --> 19:18.590
I said no.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.593
Why make my life so difficult?

19:22.961 --> 19:25.030
Rian. What's wrong?

19:33.272 --> 19:35.073
Are you harassing her?

19:35.541 --> 19:37.509
Pardon? No, it's just that...

19:37.976 --> 19:40.779
I'll be watching you. You've been warned.

19:45.751 --> 19:50.822
I really don't want to be a tattletale,
but this is so damn frustrating.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.229
Come on.

19:58.397 --> 20:00.365
Let go of me.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.070
I told you I wasn't switching agencies.
Why are you here?

20:05.270 --> 20:07.072
You'll pull out all the fur.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.343
You got another coat?

20:11.410 --> 20:14.079
I'm a celebrity's mother. I can't just
wear any coat when I meet people.

20:15.180 --> 20:19.184
If I don't dress well,
I'll tarnish your reputation.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.487
People are staring.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.022
Hurry up.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.364
Are you going to stay there?

20:44.309 --> 20:47.913
Why don't you read over
the contract first? Then we can talk.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.881
What does it take to get through to you?

20:51.483 --> 20:53.719
-Mister.
-Pardon? Me?

20:54.219 --> 20:55.988
Will you repeat any of this to anyone?

20:56.054 --> 20:57.422
Of course not.

20:57.489 --> 20:59.791
Without film footage,
you'll be spreading a groundless rumor.

21:00.292 --> 21:01.560
So pretend you didn't hear.

21:02.060 --> 21:05.464
I'm not a bad daughter.
It's my mother who's bad.

21:05.530 --> 21:06.832
That's why I'm angry,

21:07.165 --> 21:10.302
so don't think I'm a brat
who lashes out at her parents.

21:10.869 --> 21:12.704
What are you doing?

21:12.771 --> 21:14.439
I want to act too.

21:14.906 --> 21:16.642
I want my worth to go up too.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.378
Of course I want to work for an agency
that treats me with respect.

21:20.646 --> 21:23.949
But what if Mr. Lee crushes me

21:25.284 --> 21:27.252
and I have no way to make it back up?

21:28.387 --> 21:30.789
What if everyone ends up
walking all over me?

21:35.260 --> 21:36.395
You're my mother.

21:37.863 --> 21:39.564
Why is it always money over my well-being?

21:39.631 --> 21:41.600
Why can't you put
what's best for me first?

21:41.667 --> 21:42.834
You're...

21:44.569 --> 21:46.672
You're just having such
a hard time being a singer.

21:48.373 --> 21:50.575
I would like to get off here, sir.

21:53.679 --> 21:54.680
Take this home.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.116
Please take her safely
to Kirin Art School.

21:58.884 --> 22:00.585
I'm writing down
your license plate number.

22:57.175 --> 22:58.243
That's not real fur, is it?

23:02.180 --> 23:05.283
Where did you get that furry mess?

23:06.618 --> 23:08.487
This is real fur.

23:09.488 --> 23:11.723
The fur fell out
and got all over my clothes.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.291
Why lie to me?

23:13.658 --> 23:14.960
It's not like you have to impress me.

23:16.995 --> 23:18.063
Let me see that.

23:19.431 --> 23:20.732
Good grief.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.135
I thought it was passable.

23:25.303 --> 23:28.440
But you can't tell at first glance, right?

23:29.808 --> 23:31.810
What do you do
with all the money I give you?

23:32.110 --> 23:33.645
Throw that out and get a real fur coat.

23:34.212 --> 23:36.181
You're a celebrity's mom.
You'll make me look bad

23:37.682 --> 23:39.084
walking around in a fake fur coat.

23:41.186 --> 23:42.320
Fine.

23:44.523 --> 23:45.490
Go home.

23:46.825 --> 23:47.859
Take a taxi.

24:05.143 --> 24:09.247
I'm the best dancer there is.
JB has nothing on me.

24:10.048 --> 24:13.485
And even from the start
of his singing career,

24:13.552 --> 24:15.587
he never gave dancers any respect.

24:17.522 --> 24:20.992
I have to partner up
with that dirty weasel.

24:25.430 --> 24:26.932
I didn't know you have time to waste here.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.571
Shouldn't you learn to dance?
You must be full of energy.

24:32.904 --> 24:35.507
Who says I'm going to dance?

24:36.408 --> 24:37.876
Don't you know we're doing a dance song?

24:38.410 --> 24:40.645
Don't say "we."
It doesn't sit right with me.

24:42.781 --> 24:44.149
Do you want to play a game?

24:46.685 --> 24:47.686
You'll regret it.

24:55.961 --> 24:56.928
Hey, guys.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.197
Yu-jin and JB are going
head-to-head in basketball.

24:59.264 --> 25:01.066
-Really?
-Hurry up.

25:05.136 --> 25:09.574
-We need to practice.
-How about just one game?

25:10.775 --> 25:11.776
Please.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.712
Jin Yu-jin's a great basketball player.

25:13.778 --> 25:15.046
You should come and watch.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.581
You won't regret it.

25:22.854 --> 25:23.822
What are you doing?

25:25.724 --> 25:28.126
-Do you even know how to play basketball?
-You do it your way.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.661
I'll do it my way.

25:37.502 --> 25:39.971
-Go, Yu-jin!
-Go, JB!

25:40.038 --> 25:41.106
-Let's go!
-Yu-jin.

25:41.273 --> 25:42.107
Yu-jin.

25:42.908 --> 25:43.742
Getting irritated?

25:44.609 --> 25:45.443
Come and get it.

25:45.777 --> 25:47.879
-Play properly.
-I told you to come and get it.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.054
Yu-jin!

25:58.123 --> 26:00.825
-Go, JB!
-Again.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.213
What's up with him?

26:23.982 --> 26:27.919
-JB!
-JB!

26:37.862 --> 26:39.931
He's so cool. JB's awesome.

26:40.265 --> 26:41.333
What's with him?

26:43.368 --> 26:45.070
He's dancing instead of
playing the proper game.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.158
You're doing great!

27:07.592 --> 27:08.593
Let's go JB!

27:19.971 --> 27:21.072
You're awesome, JB.

27:43.028 --> 27:43.995
Yes!

28:25.503 --> 28:27.539
JB's so cool.

28:32.010 --> 28:33.878
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.252
He's good at basketball.

28:43.455 --> 28:45.356
And that one's dancing
instead of playing basketball.

28:45.423 --> 28:46.257
He's good.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.895
I'll see you at dinner tonight.

28:52.864 --> 28:54.065
It will be a feast.

28:54.132 --> 28:55.934
Okay. See you later.

29:06.311 --> 29:07.579
The score is 15-2.

29:09.314 --> 29:10.348
You won.

29:11.616 --> 29:12.684
You must be happy.

29:28.233 --> 29:29.434
You're quite good at basketball--

30:03.535 --> 30:05.036
Where have you been?

30:05.537 --> 30:06.671
You skipped class.

30:08.506 --> 30:10.308
Is school a shopping mall to you?

30:11.142 --> 30:14.078
Is it a place you can come and go
as you please?

30:15.780 --> 30:17.849
Something came up at home.

30:20.451 --> 30:22.487
How did you know
something had come up at home?

30:32.397 --> 30:33.698
I'm sorry.

30:34.566 --> 30:38.203
You're banned from the studio
until after the monthly evaluation.

30:39.537 --> 30:40.371
What?

30:40.438 --> 30:43.842
Why should I let you use the studio
when you don't even follow the rules?

30:44.776 --> 30:47.078
You are banned from using the studio.

31:34.492 --> 31:36.060
Isn't she the vocal trainer?
What's with her?

31:37.195 --> 31:38.029
What?

31:39.030 --> 31:40.865
Why can't the vocal trainer sing?

31:47.972 --> 31:51.309
She can't sing, but she's amazing
at teaching others how to sing.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.512
Why don't we have a discussion?

31:54.579 --> 31:59.017
Don't you think the duet evaluation
is happening way too fast?

31:59.484 --> 32:01.252
The kids won't have
enough time to prepare.

32:01.719 --> 32:02.921
Sing us a song, Jeong-wan.

32:06.024 --> 32:07.392
"Jeong-wan"?

32:08.559 --> 32:10.061
Do you call each other
by your first names?

32:10.662 --> 32:11.496
Well, yes.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.198
That's so cool of you, Mr. Lee.

32:14.732 --> 32:18.970
Principal Ju's a good sport.
It must be hard to work under me.

32:25.410 --> 32:27.779
You set aside your ego and came on board.

32:27.845 --> 32:29.480
-Thanks, Jeong-wan.
-Don't mention it.

32:29.547 --> 32:30.949
-Sit.
-Okay.

32:57.875 --> 33:01.646
I must be coming down with a cold.
My singing was unusually bad today.

33:03.848 --> 33:05.216
How about a song, Jeong-wan?

33:06.150 --> 33:07.719
It's been ages since I've heard you sing.

33:08.319 --> 33:11.522
-You should go first, Mr. Lee.
-No.

33:11.589 --> 33:14.459
You two should sing a Galaxy song.

33:16.027 --> 33:18.563
Galaxy!

33:24.168 --> 33:25.169
Mr. Yang,

33:25.937 --> 33:27.205
get the party started.

33:27.572 --> 33:29.374
-Do you want me to sing?
-Yes.

33:30.441 --> 33:31.409
Yes. Sing us a song.

33:31.476 --> 33:33.511
If you do well, I'll help you
make your debut as a singer.

34:10.848 --> 34:11.916
Isn't he the English teacher?

34:14.152 --> 34:15.920
Those aren't amateur moves.

34:30.868 --> 34:31.803
What is he doing?

34:53.958 --> 34:56.527
We did similar choreography.
Didn't we, Jeong-wan?

34:57.028 --> 34:59.497
Yes, and then we went bust.

35:00.398 --> 35:02.233
You were always a terrible dancer.

35:12.043 --> 35:13.177
Sugar cube.

35:14.479 --> 35:16.614
Those two must do nothing
but dance all day.

35:20.651 --> 35:21.486
Excuse me.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.555
I need to use the restroom.

35:35.199 --> 35:36.667
It's not easy to go with the flow.

35:43.007 --> 35:43.841
I can hear him.

35:44.709 --> 35:45.843
I can hear him.

35:47.445 --> 35:48.279
I can hear him.

35:49.647 --> 35:51.082
What are you doing?

35:51.749 --> 35:52.950
I can hear him.

35:54.318 --> 35:57.421
He's coming.

35:58.556 --> 35:59.590
He's here.

36:00.892 --> 36:02.226
Who's coming?

36:03.761 --> 36:05.763
I can't do this duet with you.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.301
But it's fate.

36:11.969 --> 36:14.839
Do you have psychic powers?

36:16.307 --> 36:17.341
Can you see ghosts?

36:20.044 --> 36:22.380
I can't see them. I only hear them.

36:22.446 --> 36:24.115
Why? Because they're souls.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.653
He comes along with the music.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.624
He says...

36:34.592 --> 36:37.795
that you should sing and I should dance.

36:39.130 --> 36:39.964
What?

36:40.531 --> 36:42.266
Don't play dumb.

36:42.333 --> 36:46.170
If you sing and I dance,
he says we'll get the highest score.

36:48.272 --> 36:52.843
You should go to Hogwarts
with Harry Potter.

36:52.910 --> 36:54.245
Why are you at Kirin?

36:54.579 --> 36:58.049
I know it's hard to believe,
but just trust me.

36:58.749 --> 37:01.852
There's more to this evaluation
than meets the eye.

37:03.321 --> 37:04.288
I sense...

37:06.691 --> 37:09.060
something ominous
about the upcoming evaluation.

37:11.729 --> 37:14.365
There will be a bloodbath.

37:52.536 --> 37:53.537
Stop.

38:04.181 --> 38:05.049
Do you smoke?

38:05.583 --> 38:06.484
No.

38:07.518 --> 38:10.054
There are two groups of people
who have short breath as you.

38:10.354 --> 38:13.724
Smokers and newborns.
The dying and just born babies.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.593
But you're neither.

38:16.494 --> 38:17.695
What could be your problem?

38:21.198 --> 38:24.402
Breathing sounds are part of music.
You can't just breathe whenever.

38:24.468 --> 38:25.936
Because your breathing is short,

38:26.003 --> 38:28.572
you have no volume control,
and you mess up the pitches and tempo.

38:28.639 --> 38:32.510
It's like the poor music notes
have lost direction.

38:34.378 --> 38:35.780
Who divided up the parts?

38:37.081 --> 38:38.215
I did.

38:38.916 --> 38:41.719
No wonder Rian
doesn't even show up to practice.

38:41.786 --> 38:43.254
Why bother?

38:44.055 --> 38:44.889
Here.

38:45.423 --> 38:46.724
Just sing the parts I marked for you.

38:50.294 --> 38:54.932
-But if I practice--
-Practice isn't all there is to singing.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.134
But all these are backing vocals.

38:57.201 --> 38:59.203
What's wrong with that?

38:59.270 --> 39:01.439
Why do a duet if you don't want
to support your partner?

39:01.706 --> 39:04.442
This isn't a competition.
It's about harmony.

39:04.508 --> 39:07.578
How can there be harmony
without backing vocals?

39:10.448 --> 39:12.149
Should we get started?

39:25.129 --> 39:25.963
What are you doing?

39:27.631 --> 39:29.033
Haven't you mastered the choreography?

39:32.036 --> 39:35.005
-Where are you going?
-To drink some water.

39:35.506 --> 39:39.377
You haven't done a thing.
No water for you.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.647
Get me a glass as well.

39:56.660 --> 40:00.698
Why don't you try blowing up
a million balloons instead?

40:06.604 --> 40:07.972
What the...

40:21.952 --> 40:23.554
-Sun-dong.
-Yes?

40:23.754 --> 40:26.323
Summon him for me.

40:27.291 --> 40:29.026
He was just here.

40:29.794 --> 40:32.263
He doesn't have to pay for a cab.
Have him come back.

40:33.063 --> 40:35.499
Ask him how I'll fare
in the upcoming audition.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.437
Are you worried?

40:46.710 --> 40:51.615
-I said we could do it over lunch.
-I wasn't hungry...

40:52.583 --> 40:54.685
He says to take the stage

40:54.752 --> 40:58.122
with a child picture
of a male idol on you.

41:40.130 --> 41:41.899
How cute.

41:43.767 --> 41:44.602
Hi.

41:45.669 --> 41:49.373
You'll meet me in about ten years.

42:18.302 --> 42:21.138
Why weren't you at the studio?
What are you doing here alone?

42:23.641 --> 42:26.010
I'm waiting for my laundry.

42:27.411 --> 42:28.646
There's nothing in the washer.

42:33.851 --> 42:34.785
How funny.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.389
You're just like everyone else here.

42:38.923 --> 42:40.224
Doing your own laundry and all.

42:42.426 --> 42:44.295
Isn't it about time that you adjust
to this place too?

42:45.496 --> 42:48.432
Your adjustment is one thing,
but your poor partner...

42:50.134 --> 42:53.437
Isn't it irresponsible of you
not to rehearse with her even once?

42:55.706 --> 42:56.707
What about you?

42:57.541 --> 42:59.410
Did you take responsibility
for what happened to Si-u?

43:03.180 --> 43:06.617
You don't even care about
your fellow member being dropped.

43:07.985 --> 43:10.588
Who are you to say such a thing to me?

43:12.222 --> 43:13.557
It was well-intended advice.

43:14.858 --> 43:16.126
Why take it the wrong way?

43:17.194 --> 43:18.963
No wonder you're still
where you've always been.

43:23.500 --> 43:24.602
What do you mean?

43:25.669 --> 43:26.870
You know what I mean.

43:28.105 --> 43:29.406
No, I do not.

43:30.908 --> 43:33.210
You must be satisfied
being the pretty face in a girl group.

43:34.578 --> 43:35.446
You're a singer.

43:36.380 --> 43:37.414
Oh, but wait.

43:38.048 --> 43:40.684
You dream of becoming an actress.
But you can't even act.

45:25.155 --> 45:27.224
Here.

45:28.125 --> 45:30.961
You'll feel better.

45:36.066 --> 45:38.502
Play with this when you feel sad.

45:39.903 --> 45:40.938
It will make you feel better.

46:28.719 --> 46:29.920
Can't you knock?

46:30.354 --> 46:32.556
Whatever.

46:33.357 --> 46:34.558
Burn me a CD.

46:34.892 --> 46:35.793
Of what?

46:35.859 --> 46:37.795
Our choreography.

46:38.395 --> 46:41.131
I don't want to spend
more time with you than necessary.

46:52.176 --> 46:53.143
Gosh.

46:53.610 --> 46:55.579
I know why I should've knocked now.

46:59.550 --> 47:00.617
Isn't that basic manners?

47:01.185 --> 47:02.853
No dating.

47:04.755 --> 47:06.356
Are you allowed to violate
school regulations?

47:06.623 --> 47:07.724
What do you mean?

47:13.630 --> 47:17.000
-What are you doing here?
-Sorry. One thing led to another...

47:17.601 --> 47:18.869
How long have you been there?

47:20.270 --> 47:21.672
I...

47:22.372 --> 47:24.208
It's not what you're thinking.

47:24.741 --> 47:26.543
Sorry.

47:32.683 --> 47:33.584
Are you two dating?

47:34.751 --> 47:35.819
Watch what you say.

47:37.221 --> 47:38.488
So she's a stalker.

47:50.968 --> 47:52.236
I should just go kill myself.

47:52.936 --> 47:53.904
I deserve to die.

47:54.838 --> 47:56.340
What was I thinking?

48:49.493 --> 48:51.695
-Is your throat still bothering you?
-A bit.

48:52.229 --> 48:54.865
-Then let's stop practicing.
-The evaluation's coming up.

48:56.934 --> 48:59.569
Let's go to the studio. It's cramped here.

48:59.836 --> 49:03.140
It's nice and humid here,
and gives off the right echoes.

49:04.942 --> 49:07.344
I can't sing loud right now.
Let's keep going.

49:10.881 --> 49:12.349
Three, four.

49:33.837 --> 49:36.573
-Let's go to the doctor.
-But it's Sunday.

49:36.640 --> 49:39.609
-How about the ER?
-Don't go overboard.

49:49.419 --> 49:50.988
-You know what?
-What?

49:51.054 --> 49:53.690
-When can I take this off?
-Why do you ask?

49:54.992 --> 49:57.260
Let me tell you something.

49:57.627 --> 49:59.763
Pink looks great on you.

49:59.830 --> 50:00.797
-Really?
-Yes.

50:00.864 --> 50:02.766
I have an eye for it,
and pink's your color.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.936
-You're the best.
-You seem to be loving it.

50:06.903 --> 50:08.338
-Who doesn't like compliments?
-Hey!

50:10.874 --> 50:13.043
What brings you here?

50:14.177 --> 50:15.512
Did you come empty-handed?

50:18.949 --> 50:22.753
My throat's scratchy, so I'm going to
stay silent. I must protect my voice.

50:23.453 --> 50:24.388
Go to a hospital.

50:27.791 --> 50:29.292
Oh, we're at a hospital.

50:37.501 --> 50:40.070
Being dropped
is just a silly rumor, right?

50:42.539 --> 50:45.142
You're way too nosy.

50:46.209 --> 50:50.213
Your life would be less stressful
if you were just half as selfish as Rian.

50:58.955 --> 51:01.491
-Beg Mr. Lee for forgiveness.
-Forget about it.

51:03.026 --> 51:05.896
It's so boring to be cooped up in here.

51:06.797 --> 51:08.832
They hospitalize me
whenever something goes down.

51:11.401 --> 51:12.369
Should I run away?

51:16.873 --> 51:19.443
What was that for?

51:19.509 --> 51:21.812
-It's because I'm worried about you.
-What?

51:24.347 --> 51:26.349
Isn't that scarf mine?
Don't take it with you.

51:29.019 --> 51:31.988
What? Don't take my scarf!

51:37.694 --> 51:41.765
I'll do the backing vocal.
I even split the parts like you wanted.

51:41.832 --> 51:43.166
Fine.

51:44.101 --> 51:46.002
We need to practice. Where are you going?

51:46.069 --> 51:47.704
I can't go out when I want?

51:48.305 --> 51:51.575
Practice on your own.
We'll sing together the day of.

51:51.641 --> 51:52.809
We're doing a duet.

51:52.876 --> 51:55.312
Did you really get your parts down?
In that short period of time?

51:56.646 --> 51:58.148
It's obvious you'll be terrible.

51:59.316 --> 52:01.952
How can I do a duet with someone
who's not even close to my level?

52:02.819 --> 52:03.753
Then...

52:04.688 --> 52:06.723
why did you ask me to be your partner?

52:10.393 --> 52:12.496
I didn't know you were this bad.

52:59.309 --> 53:00.410
Hey, stalker.

53:07.150 --> 53:08.218
Hey!

53:09.219 --> 53:11.988
Is that balloon for cheering JB on?

53:13.156 --> 53:14.658
It's a breathing exercise.

53:14.724 --> 53:18.595
That's a strange breathing exercise.
You look like a pufferfish.

53:20.297 --> 53:21.865
Why don't you just work out?

53:28.705 --> 53:29.906
What are you doing? Go away.

53:31.741 --> 53:34.244
Are you scared of balloons?

53:34.644 --> 53:35.912
What?

53:44.187 --> 53:46.523
Come on. Stop it!

53:48.358 --> 53:50.727
You're so funny. Come on.

53:51.494 --> 53:53.196
How can you be scared of balloons?

53:53.263 --> 53:55.365
I'm not scared. I just don't like them.

53:55.432 --> 53:58.435
You should have seen
the expression on your face.

53:59.669 --> 54:01.771
Why don't you just walk and sing instead?

54:02.239 --> 54:04.674
It's much more effective
than blowing up balloons.

54:05.342 --> 54:06.276
No thanks.

54:06.610 --> 54:08.778
I would rather blow up balloons.

54:27.998 --> 54:28.832
Hey...

54:29.666 --> 54:30.500
What?

54:30.567 --> 54:32.369
Your dancing's a lot better.

54:34.304 --> 54:35.138
How so?

54:36.072 --> 54:37.641
I should work harder on my breathing too.

54:41.611 --> 54:42.946
Hey, what's wrong?

54:45.448 --> 54:46.483
I feel dizzy.

54:48.151 --> 54:50.220
I must have blown too hard.

55:01.631 --> 55:04.668
You need to eat to sing well.

55:10.707 --> 55:14.911
Sir, we would like more radishes.

55:22.118 --> 55:25.288
Get it yourself. I'm busy, okay?

55:26.956 --> 55:29.392
If you're that busy, why not just say
I should fry the chicken myself?

55:30.860 --> 55:32.295
Smart aleck.

55:32.829 --> 55:33.663
Principal Ju.

55:34.464 --> 55:39.336
You seem to be better at frying chicken
than being a principal.

55:41.838 --> 55:45.141
And you're better
at playing basketball than singing.

55:46.476 --> 55:48.111
And you're good at eating.

55:49.846 --> 55:53.149
Principal Ju,
your fried chicken is delicious.

55:55.085 --> 55:56.353
Aren't you going to leave?

55:59.055 --> 56:01.024
-Should we have cola?
-Yes.

56:01.424 --> 56:06.396
-Cola!
-Cola!

56:07.630 --> 56:09.833
It's almost curfew. You should head back.

56:09.899 --> 56:12.235
It's curfew. Get out of here, okay?

56:13.937 --> 56:14.938
Leave!

56:22.545 --> 56:23.413
Why aren't you leaving?

56:25.382 --> 56:28.618
Why are you kicking out your customers?
That's bad customer service, you know?

56:29.052 --> 56:30.553
Don't be a wise guy. Get out of here.

56:31.020 --> 56:32.055
Thank you for the chicken.

56:32.689 --> 56:33.656
Wait.

56:35.759 --> 56:38.661
Excuse me, dear customer. You need to pay.

56:39.329 --> 56:41.564
I owe you money anyway.
Just add 20,000 won to my balance.

56:42.499 --> 56:45.435
Oh, right. Credit delinquent.

56:46.336 --> 56:47.303
What do you plan to do?

56:48.037 --> 56:49.472
Sell my guitar.

56:49.839 --> 56:52.809
The guitar you confiscated from me
is worth five million won.

56:53.042 --> 56:55.311
Did you say five million won? For that?

56:55.378 --> 56:57.814
It's probably not even worth 500,000 won.
Give me a break.

56:57.881 --> 57:00.550
-Did you say 500,000 won?
-Yes.

57:00.950 --> 57:02.952
I know you quit playing a while back,

57:03.019 --> 57:04.754
but how can you think
it's only worth 500,000 won?

57:04.821 --> 57:06.990
That's ridiculous.
It's 500,000 won at most.

57:08.591 --> 57:11.561
You can insult me,

57:11.795 --> 57:13.696
but I can't let you insult my guitar.

57:14.931 --> 57:15.899
Aren't you coming?

57:16.800 --> 57:17.700
He's coming.

57:19.302 --> 57:21.905
Enough about your guitar.
Do well on the monthly evaluation.

57:23.339 --> 57:24.207
I will.

57:24.274 --> 57:26.543
Do a good job, wise guy.

57:26.910 --> 57:29.412
I lose sleep over you guys.
Look at my graying hair.

57:31.047 --> 57:34.083
I'll pluck them out, 100 won for each
strand. I could pay you back in no time.

57:34.851 --> 57:36.486
Get the hell out of here.

57:37.554 --> 57:38.555
Go.

57:45.495 --> 57:48.698
What's up with you and Principal Ju?

57:48.765 --> 57:49.833
You seem close.

57:49.999 --> 57:52.902
Me and Ju Jeong-wan?
He's crazy, that's all.

57:56.206 --> 58:00.777
I treated you to fried chicken
and was nice to you, right?

58:05.482 --> 58:06.483
I have a favor to ask you.

58:07.250 --> 58:08.151
What is it?

58:50.927 --> 58:53.730
2012 KIRIN ART SCHOOL SHOWCASE

58:53.796 --> 58:56.299
We organized a special
event for all of you

58:56.366 --> 58:58.835
for having worked so hard
on your duets today.

58:59.435 --> 59:04.407
Until the very last performance,
each and every one of you here is a star.

59:05.742 --> 59:09.479
Strut your stuff down the red carpet
with your partner.

59:29.232 --> 59:30.500
Rian's not here yet?

59:32.335 --> 59:34.070
What is she thinking?

59:34.804 --> 59:36.439
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

59:39.275 --> 59:40.543
Where is she?

59:48.685 --> 59:50.453
-Hey! It's JB!
-Where?

59:50.520 --> 59:51.354
It's JB.

1:00:52.148 --> 1:00:54.484
JUDGE

1:00:56.886 --> 1:00:59.122
What does it feel like
to walk down the red carpet?

1:00:59.188 --> 1:01:02.125
-Good?
-Yes.

1:01:05.995 --> 1:01:08.931
What I would like to know is

1:01:10.633 --> 1:01:12.101
how many of you

1:01:13.002 --> 1:01:16.506
will be able to walk down
a real red carpet.

1:01:18.408 --> 1:01:19.308
Maybe ten?

1:01:21.144 --> 1:01:22.178
Or 20?

1:01:24.180 --> 1:01:25.214
Or 30?

1:01:30.286 --> 1:01:32.488
This is what I want to say to you.

1:01:34.257 --> 1:01:35.458
Wake up.

1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:40.963
If you want to have the right dream,
you need to wake up first.

1:01:44.434 --> 1:01:47.537
In order to help you do so,
I'm giving you a reality check.

1:01:49.806 --> 1:01:52.275
The monthly evaluation
will proceed without a rehearsal.

1:01:54.744 --> 1:01:56.179
Think of it as an audition.

1:01:59.282 --> 1:02:01.117
We haven't practiced together even once.

1:02:03.519 --> 1:02:05.021
It's a duet mission, right?

1:02:06.322 --> 1:02:09.892
One of the two members
of each team will fail.

1:02:11.494 --> 1:02:13.963
Your partner,
whom you've been working so hard with,

1:02:14.030 --> 1:02:16.566
is now your competitor.

1:02:17.967 --> 1:02:21.938
Those who pass and those who fail
will be put in different classes

1:02:24.407 --> 1:02:26.743
and will receive different treatment
in extracurricular activities.

1:02:29.979 --> 1:02:30.980
Do you find it unfair?

1:02:32.548 --> 1:02:34.317
Then survive until the very end.

1:02:35.284 --> 1:02:37.286
The last student standing

1:02:38.221 --> 1:02:39.655
will become a super idol.

1:02:45.161 --> 1:02:48.164
I'm planning on selecting
the very best Kirin students

1:02:49.198 --> 1:02:53.536
and form a super idol group
that can compete globally.

1:02:55.505 --> 1:02:58.641
The person sitting next to you

1:02:59.809 --> 1:03:04.547
may become the next
international superstar.

1:03:07.316 --> 1:03:09.085
And the journey toward that goal

1:03:11.287 --> 1:03:12.488
begins right now.

1:03:15.324 --> 1:03:16.325
All so grandiose, isn't it?

1:03:42.251 --> 1:03:43.619
Why are you so late?

1:03:44.487 --> 1:03:45.421
We need to talk.

1:03:50.793 --> 1:03:52.728
I told you we needed to practice together.

1:03:52.795 --> 1:03:55.131
How can we take the stage
without having ever practiced together?

1:03:56.766 --> 1:03:58.367
Just do your part right.

1:03:59.402 --> 1:04:00.303
What?

1:04:00.369 --> 1:04:02.839
Who cares if we don't mesh?

1:04:03.873 --> 1:04:05.508
You can win if you do better than me.

1:04:06.676 --> 1:04:07.577
Am I wrong?

1:04:15.685 --> 1:04:17.153
Let's do the duet together.

1:04:17.854 --> 1:04:19.121
What are you scheming?

1:04:20.089 --> 1:04:22.692
I would feel more comfortable
pairing up with you

1:04:23.759 --> 1:04:25.061
than someone I don't know at all.

1:04:27.630 --> 1:04:28.865
It wasn't about being comfortable.

1:04:30.499 --> 1:04:31.734
You thought you could beat me.

1:04:35.238 --> 1:04:38.040
You knew all along, didn't you?

1:04:39.709 --> 1:04:43.880
You knew that team members
were pitted against each other.

1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:46.148
That's why you asked me
to be your partner.

1:04:47.483 --> 1:04:48.317
So?

1:04:49.352 --> 1:04:50.353
What's the problem?

1:04:52.221 --> 1:04:54.123
You thought that I was the easiest
to beat, didn't you?

1:04:55.191 --> 1:04:56.859
You looked down on me too.

1:04:57.827 --> 1:04:59.328
Plus, I couldn't practice,

1:05:00.463 --> 1:05:02.098
but you seem to have practiced a lot.

1:05:03.432 --> 1:05:04.967
So go ahead and beat me.

1:05:06.035 --> 1:05:07.003
Like you just said,

1:05:07.937 --> 1:05:09.639
I practiced while you were putzing around.

1:05:10.873 --> 1:05:13.309
I will beat you.

1:05:17.213 --> 1:05:18.281
It won't be easy.

1:05:19.849 --> 1:05:21.517
On stage, I'm a pro,

1:05:23.019 --> 1:05:24.487
but you're nothing.
