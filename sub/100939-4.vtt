BIANCA:
Come on, Lucca. You can take
at least a week off.

00:15.972 --> 00:18.627
I'm sending you a photo.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.239
There.

00:22.283 --> 00:24.285
What do you have in Chicago
to match that?

00:26.113 --> 00:27.766
Work.

00:27.810 --> 00:30.943
-I have work here.
-[scoffs] You can bring
your work here.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.989
Come on, I'm lonely.
It's just me here.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.991
[chuckles]:
Yeah, you and 30 staff.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.775
It's not the same.
I'll send the jet.

00:36.819 --> 00:39.126
You can be there
and back in 14 hours.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.650
The Herz divorce, upstairs.

00:41.693 --> 00:44.653
-Let's go.
-I got to go, Bianca.

00:44.696 --> 00:47.003
-Here we are.
-Okay.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.571
I'll say right up front,
this is not about my divorce.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.399
-Is it about your business?
-It's about my reputation

00:51.442 --> 00:53.401
-and it's about this firm.
-LUCCA: Which firm?

00:53.444 --> 00:55.664
-Reddick/Boseman or STR Laurie?-Aren't you all
the same these days?

00:55.707 --> 00:57.492
I keep bouncing
from one to the other.

00:58.536 --> 01:00.190
Yes. Tell us what you need.

01:01.452 --> 01:03.585
I saw this play last night,

01:03.628 --> 01:05.326
and for some reason,
it has my divorce in it.

01:05.369 --> 01:07.980
It has your divorce?
What does that mean?

01:08.024 --> 01:10.896
My divorce from last year?
The one you handled?

01:10.940 --> 01:12.289
-Uh, the one Lucca handled.
-[laughs]: Great.

01:12.333 --> 01:15.205
Circling the wagons
already, David? Noted.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.164
Either my $34 million
in legal fees

01:17.207 --> 01:18.643
matters to you or it doesn't.

01:18.687 --> 01:20.297
-It does.
-Then how the fuck

01:20.341 --> 01:22.517
did the specifics of my divorceend up in this play?

01:22.560 --> 01:24.867
Which parts of your divorce?

01:24.910 --> 01:26.869
My job, my ex-wife,
our reasons for divorcing,

01:26.912 --> 01:28.827
everything is in the play.

01:28.871 --> 01:31.482
Even some of the things
we said in the depos.

01:31.526 --> 01:32.701
They make me look
like an asshole.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.616
And what do you want to do?

01:34.659 --> 01:37.140
Seriously? You need to ask?
I want to sue.

01:37.184 --> 01:40.839
I want to Gawker these assholesoff the stage.

01:40.883 --> 01:42.711
Just give me a second.

01:58.422 --> 01:59.902
Yeah.

01:59.945 --> 02:02.687
I have to head upstairs
in a minute.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.733
-Um...
-What is it?

02:04.776 --> 02:06.126
Duncan Herz?

02:06.169 --> 02:07.910
The pizza king?

02:07.953 --> 02:10.391
[laughs]
Is he getting divorced again?

02:10.434 --> 02:12.393
No. He was satirized in a play,

02:12.436 --> 02:14.221
and now he wants
to sue for defamation.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.223
Tell him to let it go.

02:16.266 --> 02:19.400
Satire just disappearsif you don't give it any oxygen.

02:19.443 --> 02:22.142
-Everybody hates satire.
-Unfortunately,

02:22.185 --> 02:23.882
I recognized the playwright.

02:23.926 --> 02:26.233
He worked here last year,
as an associate.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.451
Who?

02:28.583 --> 02:29.845
Jumaane Jenkins.

02:29.888 --> 02:33.892
Oh, but his name
used to be Alan North.

02:33.936 --> 02:36.112
The one we fired for drug use.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.592
Yes.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.291
Damn.

02:41.335 --> 02:44.251
Does Herz know
he's an ex-associate?

02:44.294 --> 02:46.688
Not yet.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.124
He will sue us.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.474
-Yeah.
-Okay.

02:52.302 --> 02:53.999
Let me take this.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.437
Mr. Herz!

02:56.480 --> 02:59.266
-How are you?
-Adrian.

02:59.309 --> 03:00.528
-Yeah.
-Fine.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.138
-Good.
-What's going on?

03:02.182 --> 03:05.968
Uh, Lucca here filled me
in on the issue here,

03:06.011 --> 03:11.408
and I want to say, uh,I think we have some good news.

03:11.452 --> 03:14.977
We might have a path
to the lawsuit right here.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.284
So, uh, you give us a day,

03:17.327 --> 03:19.155
we'll take a look at the play,
and we'll see

03:19.199 --> 03:21.201
if any privileged information
was taken from our office.

03:21.244 --> 03:23.159
HERZ:
Good. I thought you were gonna

03:23.203 --> 03:25.335
-tell me to drop it.
-ADRIAN: Never. [chuckles]

03:25.379 --> 03:26.902
Not when it's this serious.

03:26.945 --> 03:29.165
Great. You'll keep me in touch?

03:29.209 --> 03:31.820
-Will do.
-All right.

03:33.952 --> 03:35.127
Thanks.

03:35.171 --> 03:37.129
Privileged information?

03:37.173 --> 03:39.306
What the fuck?
Was he a lawyer here?

03:39.349 --> 03:40.655
It's somebody we fired.

03:40.698 --> 03:43.266
Jesus, this place
is bush-league.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.920
David...

03:44.963 --> 03:46.617
[laughs]:
Fuck you.

03:46.661 --> 03:50.055
Take your opinion upstairs
and see what they say.

03:51.709 --> 03:55.017
[beeping]

03:55.060 --> 03:58.020
So, I don't understand.
The malware only attacks here?

03:58.063 --> 04:00.065
And only when I use
the firm's Wi-Fi.

04:01.415 --> 04:03.852
So someone here
is trying to freeze me out

04:03.895 --> 04:06.507
whenever I ask
"What is Memo 618?"

04:06.550 --> 04:09.249
-No, not here.
-Then where?

04:13.078 --> 04:16.386
Someone upstairs
is blocking my Wi-Fi access?

04:16.430 --> 04:19.346
Their head of litigation:
Bryan Kneef.

04:19.389 --> 04:22.697
-You're kidding. Why?
-My guess is because

04:22.740 --> 04:24.089
you're asking about
what you're asking about.

04:25.308 --> 04:28.529
Memo 618? He knows what it is?

04:28.572 --> 04:30.879
Uh...
[exhales]

04:32.402 --> 04:34.361
Where are you going?

04:34.404 --> 04:36.972
-To ask him.
-To ask him if he knows
about Memo 618?

04:37.015 --> 04:38.190
Yes.

04:38.234 --> 04:39.888
Is that smart?

04:39.931 --> 04:41.933
I don't know anymore.

04:48.723 --> 04:51.682
Hi. I need to speak
to Bryan Kneef.

04:51.726 --> 04:53.902
This way, Ms. Lockhart.

-[seabirds chirping]
-They're waiting for you.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.994

04:59.037 --> 05:00.430
Everyone.

05:11.093 --> 05:12.312

Diane.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.531
Thank you for coming.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.620
You're welcome.
Uh, was I expected?

05:16.664 --> 05:18.622
Yes. Of course.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.538
Uh, you know what? I don't thinkyou've met, uh, Tom,

Oh, and Bryan Kneef.I think you two know each other.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.944
No. We haven't met.

05:35.987 --> 05:38.425
-Just online. Diane.
-[Roger hiccups]

05:41.993 --> 05:43.647
So there was a student,

05:43.691 --> 05:46.128
Yamaoka, who sought out
a Zen master

05:46.171 --> 05:50.698
and proclaimed, "The mind,
the Buddha, attainment,

05:50.741 --> 05:52.917
"everything is emptiness.

05:52.961 --> 05:55.746
Nothing really exists."

05:55.790 --> 05:57.574
The Zen master picked up
a bamboo stick

05:57.618 --> 05:59.271
and whacked him in the head.

05:59.315 --> 06:03.928
Yamaoka screamed angrily
until the master asked him,

06:03.972 --> 06:07.715
"If nothing really exists,from where did your anger come?"

06:07.758 --> 06:08.977
[Roger hiccups]

06:10.195 --> 06:11.414
Um...

06:11.458 --> 06:13.285
Is somebody angry here?

06:13.329 --> 06:16.463
-GAVIN: Bryan?
-I need you to stop
poaching my clients.

06:18.639 --> 06:21.250
-Excuse me?
-GAVIN: You know, I explained
that you were made

06:21.293 --> 06:23.426
head of pro bono, so there's
no reason for you to poach.

06:23.470 --> 06:26.298
BRYAN:
And yet, she's having her
investigator check my clients.

06:26.342 --> 06:29.519
Wait a minute. I'm only checkingyour clients to figure out

06:29.563 --> 06:32.304
why you are blocking
my Internet access.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.132
-What the hell
are you talking about?
-GAVIN: Wait.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.395
Quiet.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.309
-We're all on the same team.
-[Roger hiccups]

06:37.353 --> 06:41.139
-Roger, go get a glass of water.-[clears throat]

06:41.183 --> 06:43.533
Bryan, are you blocking
Diane's Internet access?

06:43.577 --> 06:45.187
I am. But only defensively.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.015
Because she's poaching
my clients.

06:47.058 --> 06:48.799
DIANE:
No. That is a lie.

06:48.843 --> 06:52.150
You blocked me when I asked
about Memo 618.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.022
-GAVIN: What is that?
-DIANE: I don't know.

06:54.065 --> 06:56.720
But I've had
two pro bono cases disappear

06:56.764 --> 06:58.983
when the judge
was given Memo 618.

06:59.027 --> 07:00.855
-It has nothing to do with me.
-DIANE: No.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.770
GAVIN: Okay, here's whatI suggest. Diane, you won't dig

07:02.813 --> 07:05.729
into Bryan's clients.
Bryan, you won't block

07:05.773 --> 07:08.123
Diane's Internet access.
Understood?

07:08.166 --> 07:09.733
Uh, yes.

07:09.777 --> 07:12.780
-I take no issue with that.
-BRYAN: Yes. Fine.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.176
What was that about?

07:18.220 --> 07:19.787
They want me to stop looking.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.441
-Will you?
-No.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.007
[laughs]

07:23.051 --> 07:24.182
Here.

07:24.226 --> 07:26.620
It's a billing statement.

07:26.663 --> 07:28.839
Kneef had one case with
two years of billable hours,

07:28.883 --> 07:31.276
-but no docket number.
-What?

07:33.670 --> 07:35.629
-A case that disappeared?
-Yes.

07:35.672 --> 07:38.675
And Kneef was losing
when it disappeared.

07:38.719 --> 07:40.677
-I don't see a client.
-No, it's not in the records.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.636
But...

07:42.679 --> 07:45.900
it lists the associate
on the case.

07:45.943 --> 07:47.205
[keyboard clicking]

07:57.128 --> 07:59.696
-Yes, ma'am?
-You're not shaving anymore.

07:59.740 --> 08:03.178
I got a special dispensation.

08:03.221 --> 08:05.267
I'm bored.
I want to be entertained.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.269
[laughs softly]
You want me to sing to you?

08:07.312 --> 08:09.706
No. Tell me a joke.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.230
Man walks into a zoo.

08:12.274 --> 08:15.886
The only animal
in the entire zoo is a dog.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.932
It's a Shih Tzu.

08:19.150 --> 08:20.935
Want me to explain it to you?

08:20.978 --> 08:22.850
No, I get it.
I'm just not laughing.

08:22.893 --> 08:26.549
Caleb Garlin?
Do you have a minute?

08:26.593 --> 08:28.246
You, uh, worked with Bryan Kneef

08:28.290 --> 08:30.248
on a civil suit
that we can't find.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.076
JAY:
It was about six months ago.

08:32.120 --> 08:36.254
$895,000 in billable hours,
but no mention of the client.

08:36.298 --> 08:39.257
Uh, whatever you tell us, uh,
won't get back to Mr. Kneef.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.911
[scoffs]Oh, I don't care. He's a prick.

08:40.955 --> 08:42.565
Uh, Nola Garnett.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.436
The Tapas Group. Wrongful death.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.397
The docket number was, uh,
57-L-45-20.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.965
Wow. You have a good memory.

08:51.008 --> 08:53.663
[chuckles] I just don't trust
digital archiving.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.535
Um...

08:55.578 --> 08:58.973
I wouldn't leave it on there.

08:59.016 --> 09:04.065
The, uh, Tapas Group was being
sued by the wife of a prisoner

09:04.108 --> 09:05.762
who died while being transported

09:05.806 --> 09:07.938
in the back of one
of their private prison vans.

09:07.982 --> 09:11.289
-So, was there a settlement?
-No, just ended.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.943
Ended in what way?

09:12.987 --> 09:14.945
Kneef was arguing
for a motion to dismiss.

09:14.989 --> 09:17.252
The judge recessed
to review the legal citing

09:17.295 --> 09:18.775
and he never returned.

09:20.385 --> 09:23.127
Uh-- He never returned
from the recess?

09:23.171 --> 09:24.868
Correct.

09:24.912 --> 09:27.479
-And no one followed up?
-Well, we didn't.

09:27.523 --> 09:29.177
We were losing,
so it was a gift.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.788
[laughs]: I don't know why the
plaintiffs never followed up.

09:31.832 --> 09:35.270
Was there ever a mention
of a Memo 618?

09:35.313 --> 09:36.924
No. What's that?

09:36.967 --> 09:39.753
Uh, we're not sure.

09:39.796 --> 09:42.799
What was the citing that
the judge wanted to review?

09:42.843 --> 09:45.628
57 U.S.C. 3335.

09:45.672 --> 09:48.109
Kneef had argued it meant
the case was moot.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.632
U.S. Code...?

09:49.676 --> 09:52.069
3335.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.958
There are no pages. Look.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.264
Oh. Yeah, when they remodeled,

10:56.307 --> 10:58.092
it made it easier
to move the books.

Why have law books
if we can't use them?

11:28.818 --> 11:30.907
Are you sure
I can't offer you two half?

11:30.951 --> 11:32.822
Thank you, no.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.258
GABE:
You, young lady?

11:34.302 --> 11:36.826
No, thanks. Looks yummy.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.828
It is.

11:38.872 --> 11:42.919
So, what happened
with this prison ban lawsuit?

11:42.963 --> 11:45.313
Well, I represented
Nola Garnett.

11:45.356 --> 11:47.097
Above and beyond.

11:47.141 --> 11:49.099
Never missed a filing deadline.

11:49.143 --> 11:52.102
Made oral arguments
using alliteration

11:52.146 --> 11:54.104
that I wrote out on index cards.

11:54.148 --> 11:57.107
Hmm. But the case
was just dropped?

11:57.151 --> 11:58.413
GABE:
Mmm.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.023
Through no fault of mine.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.156
And now she is suing me.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.767
-Uh, who is?
-Nola Garnett.

12:04.811 --> 12:07.596
For ineffective assistance.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.598
Me.

12:09.641 --> 12:10.947
Ineffective.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.775
-[chuckles] Can you imagine?
-I can't.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.908
-Because this case
was just dropped?
-GABE: Mmm.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.953
They never gave me
any kind of explanation.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.781
Did the defense attorney

12:18.825 --> 12:21.915
cite a law-- U.S. 3335?

12:21.958 --> 12:23.917
Maybe. I don't know.

12:23.960 --> 12:27.485
But now, in additionto all the rest of my caseload,

12:27.529 --> 12:29.139
I have to defend myself.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.881
Oh. Who is representing you?

12:31.925 --> 12:33.622
Me. Just me.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.929
How about I represent you?

12:37.017 --> 12:38.670
Why would you do that?

12:38.714 --> 12:40.107
Yeah, why?

12:40.150 --> 12:43.110
Well, it sounds like
an injustice was done

12:43.153 --> 12:45.677
to this woman,
but for her to blame,

12:45.721 --> 12:47.810
uh, a lawyer of your stature

12:47.854 --> 12:50.813
just seems like
a further injustice.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.641
Have you much experience

12:52.684 --> 12:56.036
with these type of suits?

13:38.252 --> 13:40.428

13:40.471 --> 13:44.867
We're here tonight

He's done with her.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.882
Within one year,

13:59.926 --> 14:02.450
she will be dead
from a crack overdose.

14:02.493 --> 14:03.886
-That's bullshit.
-JONAH: And he?

14:03.930 --> 14:06.236
-She's a chef now.

It's a character.

-It's satirizing me.

We're here to do what you want.

14:43.143 --> 14:47.103
And I'm here to make white
people feel more comfortable.

are given no room

20:48.334 --> 20:51.162
to be themselves,
to speak their truths,

21:00.737 --> 21:02.696
It was an African-American firm,

some white attorneys,

21:05.220 --> 21:07.396

even more white attorneys.

21:19.495 --> 21:21.410

that all white women

21:22.716 --> 21:24.239
-want to rape black men?
-No.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.589
Uh, I think you should buy
the play on Amazon and read it

21:26.633 --> 21:28.287
or buy another ticket

21:28.330 --> 21:30.332
and see it again if that's
what you got out of this.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.987
No, you say that white people
are the disease,

21:33.030 --> 21:35.206
but I marched
with Black Lives Matter.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.426
Maybe the white people
in your law firm didn't,

21:37.470 --> 21:39.428

the right to...

was dismissed,

23:03.338 --> 23:05.775
what steps did you take
to challenge the dismissal?

What steps?

23:07.473 --> 23:08.430
Yes.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.737

23:10.780 --> 23:13.087

23:15.481 --> 23:19.441

23:19.485 --> 23:22.183
very detailed letter
to the judge.

23:22.226 --> 23:23.619
Did you get a response?

23:23.663 --> 23:25.665
-Nope.
-Mm.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.755
Did you send it?

23:30.974 --> 23:32.802
Well, no,

23:32.846 --> 23:34.456

23:34.500 --> 23:36.371
The mail delivery in my office

23:36.415 --> 23:38.547

Dylan, "Everything is Broken"?

23:42.246 --> 23:43.813
It's so true.

23:43.857 --> 23:46.337
Mm-hmm. And did you appeal
the judge's ruling?

23:46.381 --> 23:48.470
No, but that wasn't my fault,
either.

23:48.514 --> 23:49.993
There was nothing to appeal.

23:50.037 --> 23:51.604
The judge never ruled.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.954
He just...
counted on me forgetting.

23:53.997 --> 23:55.825
And did you forget it?

23:55.869 --> 23:57.479
No, I thought
the judge was gonna call

23:57.523 --> 23:59.002

23:59.046 --> 24:01.004
-But he didn't.

that the defense attorney

24:14.235 --> 24:16.629

I-- Yes.

Yes. I mean...

24:21.242 --> 24:23.157

The judge and the defense
were corrupt.

Completely corrupt.

is your parent company, Diane.

24:30.904 --> 24:32.862
Yes, but I still think

24:32.906 --> 24:35.256
we need to call the defense
attorney, Bryan Kneef,

24:35.299 --> 24:37.519

get some more background.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.042
Yeah.

Wasn't my fault.

-Mm.

be joining us, Mr. North?

Mr. Jenkins,

25:11.466 --> 25:13.860

you told the audience

25:13.903 --> 25:15.862
during a talkback Q&A

25:15.905 --> 25:19.039
that you based your characters
on real-life people.

25:19.082 --> 25:20.127
No, I think you misheard.

given that Mr. Herz
is not a public figure,

25:40.626 --> 25:43.150
basing your character on him
is defamation.

25:43.193 --> 25:45.587
-Is that a question?
-A statement and a question.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.937
Look... [chuckles]
these characters emerged

25:47.981 --> 25:49.722
from my subconscious.

25:49.765 --> 25:51.593
When I saidthey were based on real people,

25:51.637 --> 25:54.770
I meant they were
organically derived composites

25:54.814 --> 25:56.337

26:00.123 --> 26:02.169
Yes. You admitted that you baseda character on our client.

26:02.212 --> 26:04.911

26:04.954 --> 26:06.477
Mr. Herz,

26:06.521 --> 26:09.611

accidentally echoed

26:09.655 --> 26:11.091
details from your case,

26:11.134 --> 26:12.788
I'm sorry.

26:12.832 --> 26:15.965

26:24.844 --> 26:26.585
Why not take him up on this?

26:26.628 --> 26:27.977
Because...

26:28.021 --> 26:29.892
you said the point was
to stop the play.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.590
Now, if we don't stop it,

You said a lawsuit

32:08.491 --> 32:11.755
I mean, to learn
about play development.

32:11.799 --> 32:14.106
[exhales]
First draft, second draft,

32:14.149 --> 32:15.977
third, fourth, and fifth.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.805
-Wow, that was fast.
-[exhales]

32:17.848 --> 32:19.807
Playwrights are easy.
They hate each other.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.461
Want me to stay and read?

32:21.504 --> 32:23.158
No. We're on it.

32:23.202 --> 32:24.246
MARISSA:
Okay, good.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.639
-Good luck.
-[chuckles]

32:25.682 --> 32:26.814
Thanks, Marissa.

32:31.166 --> 32:33.647
Oh.
[chuckles softly]

32:33.690 --> 32:34.953
What's that?

32:34.996 --> 32:36.955
Uh, the dildo.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.478
What page?

32:38.521 --> 32:40.219
Uh, 53.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.358
Wow.

32:49.402 --> 32:52.013
I'm a little saucy, aren't I?

32:52.057 --> 32:54.146
Who's Damian supposed to be?

32:54.189 --> 32:55.843
Uh, an associate.

32:55.886 --> 32:58.324
-No, I mean in reality.
-Oh.

32:58.367 --> 32:59.586
Uh, no one.

32:59.629 --> 33:01.327
I mean, n-no one I know.
I--

33:01.370 --> 33:05.026
Yeah, but I seem
to be pursuing him.

33:05.070 --> 33:08.290
"I've never slept
with a white man before.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.684
Have you ever slept
with a black woman?"

33:10.727 --> 33:13.774
-[chuckles]-"No, but I'm into trying thingsonce."

33:13.817 --> 33:16.168
"They reach for each other
and kiss."

33:16.211 --> 33:19.606
"Whispering,
'Your lips feel different.'"

33:19.649 --> 33:22.043
[chuckles]
"Yours, too.

33:22.087 --> 33:24.828
Soft."
[laughs]

33:28.832 --> 33:30.051
Wow. Wh-Whoa.

33:30.095 --> 33:31.400
That took a turn there.

33:31.444 --> 33:34.534
Yeah, I don't know
how they'd do that onstage.

33:34.577 --> 33:36.666
"Control me.

33:36.710 --> 33:38.059
Dominate me."

33:38.103 --> 33:39.713
"He pulls her hair back."

33:39.756 --> 33:43.847
He seems to think that allinterracial relationships are...

33:43.891 --> 33:46.067
are about power.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.721
-Are they?
-I don't know. I've...

33:47.764 --> 33:49.418
[chuckles]:
I've never been in one.

33:49.462 --> 33:50.724
Have you?

33:50.767 --> 33:52.682
-No.
-No.

33:52.726 --> 33:54.380
We're both just racists.

33:54.423 --> 33:55.903
[both chuckle]

33:55.946 --> 34:00.777
I think it's probably
a lack of opportunity.

34:01.778 --> 34:03.476
Ah.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.101
Anyway...

34:20.145 --> 34:23.365
Yeah, it's late. Um...

34:23.409 --> 34:25.367
I'm gonna take this home.

34:25.411 --> 34:27.021
Yeah.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.892
[laughing]:
That's a good idea.

34:30.633 --> 34:33.201
You know, I-I wasn't tryingto suggest anything when I-I...

34:33.245 --> 34:35.769
Oh, no, I-I... I wasn't, either.
[laughs]

34:35.812 --> 34:37.466
-You know, just working late.
-Right.

34:37.510 --> 34:39.294
Yeah. [laughs]

34:42.515 --> 34:44.473
Wait.

34:44.517 --> 34:45.953
What?

34:45.996 --> 34:47.433
Where I stopped reading,

34:47.476 --> 34:49.435
the description,

34:49.478 --> 34:52.133
Damian pulls her hair back,

34:52.177 --> 34:54.875
Liz lets out a moan.

34:54.918 --> 34:56.920
Liz?

34:56.964 --> 34:58.748
Yup.

35:07.931 --> 35:09.455
Kurt?

35:09.498 --> 35:11.239
-Huh?
-What time

35:11.283 --> 35:12.980
do you have to be at work?

35:13.023 --> 35:15.461
Why?

35:17.332 --> 35:19.639
[very quiet chuckle]

35:19.682 --> 35:21.293
Huh.

35:21.336 --> 35:23.991
[razor buzzing]

35:25.035 --> 35:26.646
[Diane giggles]

35:26.689 --> 35:28.691
[Kurt growls]

35:29.692 --> 35:32.173
Mr. Jenkins.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.088
Ah, you got my name right.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.829
That wasn't too hard, now,
was it?

35:35.872 --> 35:37.657
So you stated
that the characters

35:37.700 --> 35:41.182
in your play were composites
of many people you encount...?

35:41.226 --> 35:42.836
-No.
-LIZ: Caleb.

35:42.879 --> 35:46.187
Uh, "these characters emerged
from my subconscious.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.972
They were organically-derived
composites that..."

35:49.016 --> 35:51.975
-Thank you, Mr. Memory.
-But as you can see

35:52.019 --> 35:53.542
from these earlier drafts

35:53.586 --> 35:56.197
of your play right here,

35:56.241 --> 35:58.547
you named the characters...

35:58.591 --> 36:00.680
by their real names.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.727
Liz, Adrian, Diane.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.470
Yes, but...

36:08.514 --> 36:12.561
I threw those thoughts away, and

36:12.605 --> 36:14.694
created new characters.

36:14.737 --> 36:16.304
The characters are the same.

36:16.348 --> 36:19.002
And if you were a better lawyer,you would know

36:19.046 --> 36:21.222
that right now, you are...

36:21.266 --> 36:23.224
What's the Latin term?

36:23.268 --> 36:24.704
Um...

36:24.747 --> 36:26.227
Fucked.

36:28.098 --> 36:31.450
[laughing]

36:33.887 --> 36:36.237
[indistinct chatter
outside room]

36:36.281 --> 36:39.066
Oh, my God, I'm sorry for
my lateness. [inhales sharply]

36:39.109 --> 36:40.981
I, uh... I got held up.

36:41.024 --> 36:43.113
[Diane chuckles]

36:44.289 --> 36:47.292
I'm objecting to this subpoena.

36:47.335 --> 36:49.294
You and I are
from the same firm.

36:49.337 --> 36:51.818
Yes, and you're just hereto offer background, Mr. Kneef.

36:51.861 --> 36:54.777
You're, uh... you're not
the defendant, so... relax.

36:54.821 --> 36:57.171
Have a seat.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.695
[Diane clears throat]

37:01.697 --> 37:03.612
So, hello.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.484
Hello.

37:05.527 --> 37:09.662
Mr. Kneef, um,
you called a recess

37:09.705 --> 37:13.883
in the case of
Nola Garnett v. Tapas Group,

37:13.927 --> 37:17.365
docket number 45-L-7820.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.151
That was a question, sir.

37:21.195 --> 37:22.544
I have no answer.

37:24.198 --> 37:26.679
You have no answer as to whetheryou called the recess?

37:26.722 --> 37:28.550
I have no answer
to your question.

37:30.552 --> 37:35.514
All right. Did you not cite
57 U.S. Code 3335

37:35.557 --> 37:37.820
-in requesting this recess?
-Nope.

37:37.864 --> 37:40.345
No, you did not?

37:40.388 --> 37:42.869
No, I requested your ass.

37:47.569 --> 37:49.528
And-and what does that mean?

37:49.571 --> 37:52.226
It means your ass.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.229
Are you refusing to answer?

37:55.273 --> 37:57.449
No, I am answering.

37:57.492 --> 37:58.841
I have requested your ass.

37:58.885 --> 38:00.582
Do you want me
to spell it out for you?

38:01.931 --> 38:04.369
DIANE:
I have asked you

38:04.412 --> 38:06.545
whether you cited a legal ruling

38:06.588 --> 38:08.460
in requesting this recess?

38:08.503 --> 38:11.027
-Yes, and I have answered.
-Would you like me to call

38:11.071 --> 38:12.942
the judge and insist
on your compliance?

38:12.986 --> 38:15.380
-I would like you
to call your ass.
-Are you getting this?

38:15.423 --> 38:17.382
BRYAN:
Oh, here, let me help you.

38:17.425 --> 38:20.776
I have told the plaintiff's
lawyer to call her own ass.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.778
And people make fun
of the way I practice law.

38:22.822 --> 38:24.389
MONICA:
Just answer the question, sir.

38:24.432 --> 38:25.738
We can get out of here
a lot faster.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.130
We'll get to your assfaster.

38:29.611 --> 38:31.961
What is Memo 618?

38:34.964 --> 38:36.923
Have I not made it clear?

38:36.966 --> 38:39.099
It-It's your ass.

38:39.142 --> 38:41.580
Memo 618 is your ass.

38:41.623 --> 38:43.538
When you're dead,

38:43.582 --> 38:46.280
and you're on the autopsy table,

38:46.324 --> 38:48.630
and they're taking photos
of your body,

38:48.674 --> 38:50.937
when they come to your ass,

38:50.980 --> 38:53.548
that's Memo 618.

38:53.592 --> 38:56.943
Next time you come for me,
remember--

38:56.986 --> 38:58.988
we have your ass.

39:02.818 --> 39:04.994
[door opens, door closes]

39:05.038 --> 39:07.127
What the hell was that?

39:14.482 --> 39:16.136
Mr. Firth?

39:16.179 --> 39:17.746
May I help you?

39:17.790 --> 39:20.227
Yes, Diane.
Do you have a moment?

39:20.270 --> 39:23.143
Oh, sure, but I could have
come up to your office.

39:26.276 --> 39:28.714
Why are you representing
Gabe Kovac?

39:30.846 --> 39:32.979
We go back a long way.

39:35.677 --> 39:37.810
[sniffles]

39:37.853 --> 39:40.203
Shall we be honest
with each other?

39:42.510 --> 39:44.469
Um...

39:44.512 --> 39:46.427
Okay.

39:46.471 --> 39:49.865
Is there some sort of, um...

39:49.909 --> 39:52.259
get-out-of-jail-free card

39:52.302 --> 39:54.653
for, uh,
rich and powerful clients?

39:54.696 --> 39:57.351
Not that I'm aware of.
Why do you ask?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.484
Well, you assign me
to pro bono cases,

39:59.527 --> 40:01.616
and you want me to do my best?

40:01.660 --> 40:03.444
-Yes, of course.
-Right.

40:03.488 --> 40:05.968
Well, there is something
going on

40:06.012 --> 40:09.668
whereby certain people,
rich and powerful people,

40:09.711 --> 40:13.062
don't have to comply
with subpoenas

40:13.106 --> 40:15.369
or judicial rulings,

40:15.413 --> 40:17.502
and can end a lawsuit

40:17.545 --> 40:19.678
if they thinkthe ruling will go against them.

40:19.721 --> 40:22.028
You've experienced this?

40:22.071 --> 40:24.073
Yes.

40:24.117 --> 40:26.685
And Bryan Kneef,
one of your lawyers upstairs,

40:26.728 --> 40:29.339
seems to have benefited
from one of those cases.

40:29.383 --> 40:31.690
-And you're investigating this?-Yes.

40:35.084 --> 40:37.043
Now, I'm sure you will agree

40:37.086 --> 40:39.045
that we should all be subject

40:39.088 --> 40:41.526
to the same system of justice.

40:41.569 --> 40:43.571
But we're not.

40:45.268 --> 40:47.357
If I'm given a subpoena,

40:47.401 --> 40:49.751
I have to comply.

40:49.795 --> 40:52.232
I have to answer honestly.

40:52.275 --> 40:55.148
And if I don't,
I should be prosecuted.

40:56.758 --> 40:59.239
That is the only way
that the system works.

40:59.282 --> 41:01.241
And if it doesn't work that way,

41:01.284 --> 41:04.374
then the country breaks down.

41:04.418 --> 41:07.421
It's over.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.554
We're done.

41:11.164 --> 41:15.429
Now, you've given me, um,control of these pro bono cases,

41:15.473 --> 41:17.518
and this is essential

41:17.562 --> 41:19.955
to my involvement
in these cases.

41:23.785 --> 41:25.657
Okay.

41:25.700 --> 41:27.572
Just keep me in touch.

41:32.794 --> 41:35.710
Uh, Diane, I know that it seems

41:35.754 --> 41:38.931
like I am the enemy, but...

41:38.974 --> 41:41.063
sometimes...

41:41.107 --> 41:44.197
I don't even know what's
going on in my own law firm.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.592
Understood.

41:49.332 --> 41:51.509
-[loud squeaking]
-[indistinct chatter]

41:52.771 --> 41:55.164
[squeaking]

41:57.602 --> 41:59.299
Lucca Quinn.

41:59.342 --> 42:00.779
Mister... Mr. Firth.

42:00.822 --> 42:02.171
Uh, what are...
what are your...?

42:02.215 --> 42:03.477
Uh, I would have come up.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.392
Mm, I know. I know.

42:05.435 --> 42:07.002
-Can I get you anything?
-No.

42:07.046 --> 42:09.135
Well, I see that you got one
of these new desks.

42:09.178 --> 42:12.094
-Yes.
-Ah. You like it?

42:12.138 --> 42:13.618
No.

42:13.661 --> 42:15.271
Um... [laughing]: No.

42:15.315 --> 42:17.491
-Oh. Hmm.
-[laughs]

42:17.535 --> 42:20.320
Um, Bianca Skye wants you
to help her

42:20.363 --> 42:22.278
with a real estate purchase
in Saint Lucia.

42:22.322 --> 42:23.715
What?

42:23.758 --> 42:25.194
Bianca Skye has
a multimillion dollar purchase

42:25.238 --> 42:26.631
in Saint Lucia.

42:26.674 --> 42:28.633
Seems there's some tax issue.

42:28.676 --> 42:30.809
I suggested David Lee,
but she wanted you.

42:32.027 --> 42:33.986
There's no purchase there, sir.

42:34.029 --> 42:36.118
How do you mean?

42:36.162 --> 42:38.730
She's just lonely from her-herdivorce. She-she wants a friend.

42:38.773 --> 42:40.296
Do you not want to go?

42:40.340 --> 42:41.950
No. I just...

42:41.994 --> 42:43.865
I want to be useful to the firm.

42:43.909 --> 42:45.867
Then, go.

42:45.911 --> 42:48.478
You'll earn $850 an hour,
including travel.

42:48.522 --> 42:52.178
More importantly, you'll keep
our top client happy.

42:52.221 --> 42:54.180
[laughs softly]

42:54.223 --> 42:56.835
I feel like
I'm being prostituted, sir.

42:56.878 --> 42:59.533
Hmm.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.361
For ten years,

43:01.404 --> 43:03.885
Marlon Brando wanted me
by his side

43:03.929 --> 43:05.800
on his island, Tetiaroa,

43:05.844 --> 43:09.848
just in case any legal issues
came up.

43:09.891 --> 43:12.764
There were nolegal issues...

43:12.807 --> 43:14.853
ever.

43:14.896 --> 43:18.857
All I did all day was sit
on a beach and drink Mai Tais.

43:18.900 --> 43:20.554
Know why he wanted me there?

43:20.598 --> 43:22.382
A year earlier,

43:22.425 --> 43:26.604
I had made a-a funny
knock-knock joke in a meeting.
