00:03.542 --> 00:05.417
Stan, I was cleaning
your study

00:05.417 --> 00:07.583
and found something
we need to discuss.

00:07.583 --> 00:10.125
Not my journal!
How dare you?!

00:10.125 --> 00:11.750
Those are
my most private thoughts!

00:11.750 --> 00:13.000
Okay, I confess.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Every entry was plagiarized
from The Diary of Anne Frank.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.500
I was staring
at that blank page,

00:17.500 --> 00:18.917
and I couldn't
think of a damn thing.

00:18.917 --> 00:21.625
I'm blocked, Francine.
I don't have it anymore.

00:21.625 --> 00:23.375
Maybe I never did!

00:23.375 --> 00:24.792
What? No!

00:24.792 --> 00:27.208
I found the events calendar
for Steve's school.

00:27.208 --> 00:29.458
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
I forgot all about that

00:29.458 --> 00:32.000
because I-I've just been
flowing on my journal.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.291
Well, they're having an assembly
to promote abstinence.

00:35.291 --> 00:37.834
Shouldn't they be learning
about safe sex?

00:37.834 --> 00:39.959
Have you given Steve
the talk?

00:39.959 --> 00:42.125
Steve doesn't need the talk.
He's not ready.

00:42.125 --> 00:45.458
Let's not tarnish the innocence
of Daddy's sexless little boy.

00:45.458 --> 00:47.709
Sexless?!
Look at him!

00:49.709 --> 00:51.834
Ohh.

00:51.834 --> 00:54.208
Mmm. Mmm.

00:54.208 --> 00:57.250
Whoa! Taking control!

00:57.250 --> 00:58.458
Rawr!

00:58.458 --> 01:01.291
He's playing a harmless game
of Quidditch.

01:01.291 --> 01:02.583
From Harry Potter?

01:02.583 --> 01:05.500
The kid wizard with two friends
and, like, tons of problems?

01:05.500 --> 01:07.625
Dang, girl!
You a freak!

01:11.709 --> 01:13.959
I'm not fully versed
on the rules of Quidditch,

01:13.959 --> 01:16.041
but I think
that's worth three points.

01:19.250 --> 01:22.291

feeling turnt --

02:02.083 --> 02:04.041
away from sex!

02:04.041 --> 02:06.458
This next sketch shows us
how to stand up to someone

02:06.458 --> 02:08.792
that bullies you
for choosing abstinence.

02:08.792 --> 02:11.500
Now, who'd like to volunteer
to play our virgin?

02:11.500 --> 02:14.291
Yeah. Can I volunteer
to get punched in the dick?

02:14.291 --> 02:16.500
What sucker's
gonna go for -- Aah!

02:16.500 --> 02:18.250
I got a virgin for ya!

02:18.250 --> 02:20.458
Yeah! Mertz! Get him!

02:20.458 --> 02:22.250
Why aren't you
stopping this?!

02:22.250 --> 02:25.625
'Cause I'm the straw
that stirs the drink, biotch.

02:25.625 --> 02:27.500
Whoo-hoo!

02:28.333 --> 02:31.333
Hi, Carl. Just gonna squeeze in
a quick cry before Algebra.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.667
You know the rules.

02:32.667 --> 02:34.959
Just don't look inside
my black, metal trunk.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.041
Steve!
Oh, hey.

02:38.041 --> 02:39.667
I wanted to
introduce myself

02:39.667 --> 02:41.625
and say how great
you did onstage.

02:41.625 --> 02:44.625
I thought it was really brave
how you stood your ground,

02:44.625 --> 02:47.291
silently crying
when Mertz pantsed you.

02:47.291 --> 02:49.291
Then how you courageously
called out the names

02:49.291 --> 02:52.000
of other virgins
Mertz could pick on instead --

02:52.000 --> 02:53.375
until Principal Lewis
came up

02:53.375 --> 02:55.625
and mimed ejaculating yogurt
all over you.

02:55.625 --> 02:58.291
And still, you did nothing --
absolutely nothing.

02:58.291 --> 02:59.750
Weren't you
about to say your name?!

02:59.750 --> 03:00.959
I'm Shannon.

03:00.959 --> 03:03.083
I was wondering if you'd
like to join our purity group.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.125
We've been looking to modernize
by adding a boy,

03:05.125 --> 03:07.917
and it's obvious
you're a committed virgin.

03:07.917 --> 03:09.458
What's a purity group?

03:09.458 --> 03:11.667
Really? We just had, like,
a whole assembly --

03:11.667 --> 03:13.000
Never mind.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.750
Uh, a group of us
pledged to abstain

03:14.750 --> 03:17.375
from any sexual activity
until marriage.

03:17.375 --> 03:19.417
Purposefully?
Yeah!

03:19.417 --> 03:21.041
When you're not
worrying about sex,

03:21.041 --> 03:23.250
there's time for all kinds
of fun stuff.

03:23.250 --> 03:26.667
I-It's nerdy, but I'm writing
a play based on Deathstroke.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.792
The supervillain
from DC Comics?

03:28.792 --> 03:30.542
You know,
he prefers to go by...

03:30.542 --> 03:31.834
...Deathstroke the Terminator,

03:31.834 --> 03:33.542
although his real name
is Slade Wilson.

03:33.542 --> 03:35.083
And don't forget
about those...

03:35.083 --> 03:37.542
...haunting
Vietnam flashbacks!

03:37.542 --> 03:38.917
Or that he...

03:38.917 --> 03:41.250
...murdered
his first son!

03:45.333 --> 03:47.583
Uh, eh, anyway...

03:47.583 --> 03:48.834
...we're all meeting
tonight.

03:48.834 --> 03:50.041
Hope you can make it.

03:53.834 --> 03:58.291
I...run...this...city!

04:01.083 --> 04:21.375
♪♪

04:23.041 --> 04:29.625
♪♪

04:29.625 --> 04:33.709
This is the best place
in the woooorld!

04:33.709 --> 04:36.542
I'm never going hoooome!

04:37.625 --> 04:38.875
Damn it.
We came home.

04:38.875 --> 04:41.041
We spent 12 days
at that slide,

04:41.041 --> 04:42.291
and it never got old.

04:42.291 --> 04:44.959
I'm already starting to forget
how awesome it felt.

04:44.959 --> 04:47.166
The anticipation
climbing the ladder.

04:47.166 --> 04:50.375
The butterflies in your stomach
right before your turn.

04:50.375 --> 04:54.000
The permanent layer of moisture
on every restroom toilet seat.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.625
Yes, yes! Yeah! That!

04:55.625 --> 04:57.667
But we left
those feelings behind

04:57.667 --> 05:00.625
at the Coors Light Water Kingdom
in Oxford, Ohio.

05:00.625 --> 05:02.250
What if we could
get them back?

05:02.250 --> 05:04.667
Look, we have a pool. How hard
can it be to build a slide?

05:04.667 --> 05:07.166
You ever slipped
on a wet spot?
Yeah.

05:07.166 --> 05:09.583
Then you've already
built a slide.

05:09.583 --> 05:10.959
I'm...sorry?

05:10.959 --> 05:13.458
We're building
a sliiiiide!

05:13.458 --> 05:14.959
"Me wake up.

05:14.959 --> 05:16.709
Francine there.

05:16.709 --> 05:18.250
I do shower."

05:18.250 --> 05:19.417
Damn it!

05:19.417 --> 05:21.458
Journals is hard!

05:21.458 --> 05:25.000
Stan, this is the eighth broom
we've gone through this month.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.250
You have to have
the talk with Steve!

05:27.250 --> 05:28.333
I know.

05:28.333 --> 05:29.875
Then why
don't you do it?!

05:29.875 --> 05:32.375
Because I'm afraid I'll do it
wrong and screw him up.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.625
That's what happened
to me.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.000
What are you
talking about?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.125
I've...never told you

05:37.125 --> 05:39.625
about the time
my dad gave me the talk.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.959
Although, technically,
it was more of a "watch."

05:42.959 --> 05:44.959
Yeah.
Here's a little number I call

05:44.959 --> 05:47.125
the Chattanooga Wheelbarrow.

05:47.125 --> 05:48.667
Might want to put on
your poncho, son.

05:48.667 --> 05:50.375
You're in the splash zone!

05:50.375 --> 05:52.750
Hey, you got that 5 bucks
your mom gave you for candy?

05:52.750 --> 05:53.834
Fork it over.

05:53.834 --> 05:55.709
You're spoilin' me, Jack!

05:55.709 --> 05:57.917
It ain't for you,
you silly hooker!

05:57.917 --> 05:59.583
This here's
a smash-and-dash.

05:59.583 --> 06:01.834
Now, Stan,
I hope you're taking notes,

06:01.834 --> 06:02.917
'cause this is how I --

06:02.917 --> 06:05.500
Ooh! Ooh, Christ!
Oh! Oh!

06:05.500 --> 06:08.000
Looks like we struck oil!
Hand me your blankie!

06:09.250 --> 06:11.375
I was messed up
for years.

06:11.375 --> 06:13.041
Well, you're
a grown man now.

06:13.041 --> 06:16.083
And anything you tell Steve
will be better than this.

06:16.083 --> 06:18.375
Mmm!

06:18.375 --> 06:20.208
Still has Shannon's scent
on it.

06:20.208 --> 06:22.125
So pure.

06:22.125 --> 06:24.333
Well, time to crank it.

06:24.333 --> 06:26.625
What the hell?!
Get out!

06:26.625 --> 06:27.959
I know
it'll be awkward,

06:27.959 --> 06:30.417
but you're at an age
where we have to talk about...

06:30.417 --> 06:31.834
abstinence?

06:31.834 --> 06:34.750
Are you...
not interested in sex?

06:34.750 --> 06:37.125
It's --
It's complicated.

06:37.125 --> 06:38.417
This really cool girl

06:38.417 --> 06:40.291
invited me to a meeting
at the rec center tonight --

06:40.291 --> 06:42.542
- No time to talk!
- To the rec center!

06:42.542 --> 06:46.709
♪♪

06:46.709 --> 06:49.542
Oh, dang! They got hopscotch
up in this bitch?

06:49.542 --> 06:51.166
Steve!
You made it!

06:51.166 --> 06:52.583
You must be
Steve's dad.

06:52.583 --> 06:54.667
I'm Shannon's father --
Michael.

06:54.667 --> 06:57.375
She mentioned he might come
pop his purity cherry tonight.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.625
That's just
a little virgin humor.

06:59.625 --> 07:02.375
They shouldn't be
the only ones having fun.

07:02.375 --> 07:03.750
Here.
Give me your hand.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.709
I'll introduce you
to everyone.

07:06.709 --> 07:08.000
I brought my play!

07:08.000 --> 07:09.667
Uh, you probably
don't want to read it.

07:09.667 --> 07:10.875
You were just
being nice.

07:10.875 --> 07:11.959
No, I'd love to.

07:11.959 --> 07:13.291
You really
don't have to.

07:13.291 --> 07:15.083
I honestly would love
to read it.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.625
You know what?
Forget it.

07:16.625 --> 07:17.917
Just give me
the damn play!

07:17.917 --> 07:19.041
Okay,
I'll go get it.

07:19.041 --> 07:20.333
Sheesh!

07:20.333 --> 07:22.166
So, what is
this purity group?

07:22.166 --> 07:25.417
Well, in these sordid times,
we fathers have a duty to serve

07:25.417 --> 07:28.792
as the authority and protector
of our daughter's purity --

07:28.792 --> 07:30.667
mind and body.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.333
We set a standard
of manhood.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.709
And until they marry
a man we choose,

07:34.709 --> 07:36.792
they pledge themselves
to us.

07:36.792 --> 07:39.750
So...it's kind of like
you're dating your own daughter?

07:39.750 --> 07:41.291
It's exactly like that.

07:41.291 --> 07:43.125
Only way to ensure
they grow up normal.

07:43.125 --> 07:45.375
So, do you still have to
give them the sex talk?

07:47.625 --> 07:49.458
They can't have sex.
What's there to talk about?

07:49.458 --> 07:50.917
We also get swords.

07:50.917 --> 07:52.667
Shut...up!

07:52.667 --> 07:55.000
They represent our role
as knights of purity.

07:57.250 --> 08:00.041
So, you know, we have
study group with our dads,

08:00.041 --> 08:01.333
movie night
with our dads.

08:01.333 --> 08:04.333
Sometimes we skip the movies
and just go to the woods

08:04.333 --> 08:06.667
to kind of...hang out.

08:06.667 --> 08:09.959
So...it's kind of like
you're dating your own dad?

08:09.959 --> 08:11.458
It's exactly like that!

08:11.458 --> 08:13.959
Huh.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.125
Well...

08:15.125 --> 08:19.000
'bout time for me to be hittin'
the ol' dusty trail.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.583
Steve. My son.

08:22.583 --> 08:25.250
Will you make me the happiest
daddy in the world...

08:25.250 --> 08:26.333
and date me?

08:26.333 --> 08:27.875
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Say "Yes."

08:27.875 --> 08:29.250
Oh, please
say "Yes," Steve.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.458
If you join, we can
hang out all the time.

08:33.041 --> 08:35.917
Um...okay, I guess?

08:35.917 --> 08:37.291
He said "Yeeeees"!

08:38.917 --> 08:40.792
Oh! I didn't know
you guys had bells!

08:40.792 --> 08:43.375
It's a CD.
Gary has a CD player.

08:48.458 --> 08:50.500
Hey, where were you
this weekend?

08:50.500 --> 08:52.875
Sorry. I was hanging out
with some new friends.

08:52.875 --> 08:54.875
I also took a purity pledge.
I'm dating my dad.

08:54.875 --> 08:56.083
A purity pledge?!

08:56.083 --> 08:57.125
Aah!

08:57.125 --> 08:59.083
Ohhh!
Go easy, Mertz.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.792
No.
Steve, we're cool.

09:00.792 --> 09:03.625
I have too much respect
for the pledge.
You do?

09:03.625 --> 09:05.750
I'd kill to have
that kind of self-control,

09:05.750 --> 09:08.125
but I'm a slave
to my carnal appetites.

09:08.125 --> 09:11.333
I keep waking up in beds
next to strangers.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.291
I live a dark life,
Steve.

09:13.291 --> 09:17.458
Wow. Mertz, I had no idea
you were battling such demons.

09:17.458 --> 09:19.583
If you ever want to talk,
I'm here, man.

09:19.583 --> 09:21.250
I-I think
I'd like that.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.500
How about tomorrow?

09:22.500 --> 09:25.125
Maybe...
over breakfast?

09:25.125 --> 09:26.291
Right after I'm done...

09:26.291 --> 09:28.291
banging your mom!

09:28.291 --> 09:29.333
Oh!

09:34.208 --> 09:35.625
I'm an animal!

09:35.625 --> 09:37.792
A broken, filthy animal!

09:41.500 --> 09:43.083
Thank you, again,
for volunteering

09:43.083 --> 09:45.000
to help me improve
my sword skills.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.250
I didn't!
Please, I beg you, don't --

09:51.417 --> 09:52.917
Okay,
that's your shoulder,

09:52.917 --> 09:56.208
so the cucumber
should be right...here.

09:57.208 --> 09:58.417
Stan!
Huh?

10:07.959 --> 10:10.625
Whoa. That is not
what I was trying to do.

10:10.625 --> 10:12.208
Did you talk
to Steve yet?

10:12.208 --> 10:14.000
Nope. He's joined
a purity group,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.333
and now I can't give him
the talk even if I wanted to.

10:16.333 --> 10:17.959
What?!

10:17.959 --> 10:21.291
I said, Steve is taking
a pledge of abstinence.

10:21.291 --> 10:23.208
I am
his knight of chastity.

10:23.208 --> 10:25.583
Also his boyfriend.
And I have a sword.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.542
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I have to get ready
for a date with my son.

10:39.041 --> 10:40.417

I don't know.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.917
I...think
that looks right?

11:31.917 --> 11:33.375
I guess.

11:33.375 --> 11:34.417
Meaning we're done!

11:36.792 --> 11:38.250
I can't believe
we finished!

11:38.250 --> 11:39.542
Whoa!

11:39.542 --> 11:41.333
Now, that's what
I'm talking about!

11:41.333 --> 11:43.542
Um, excuse me.
Who exactly are you?

11:43.542 --> 11:44.667
I'm Kyle.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.500
Look, uh, Kyle, was it?

11:46.500 --> 11:50.041
We built this slide to recapture
this amazing butterfly feeling,

11:50.041 --> 11:51.959
so if you could
just respect that

11:51.959 --> 11:54.000
and kind of
what we're all about --

11:54.000 --> 11:55.709
Suck my , losers!

12:06.625 --> 12:10.166
Did that sound like he landed
in someone else's pool?

12:11.709 --> 12:14.208
The kids love
the purity ball.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.041
There's dinner
and speeches,

12:16.041 --> 12:19.166
and it all ends in a beautiful
dance with their dads,

12:19.166 --> 12:20.875
which symbolizes
their commitment

12:20.875 --> 12:22.583
to not have sex
until marriage.

12:24.166 --> 12:26.125
And not to talk
about it, either.

12:26.125 --> 12:27.792
Higher.

12:27.792 --> 12:29.375
Higher.

12:30.667 --> 12:31.750
Whoa!

12:33.250 --> 12:35.333
Did you hear that guy fart
across the room?

12:37.542 --> 12:40.375
Steve, now that
we're finally alone,

12:40.375 --> 12:42.542
can I confess
something?

12:42.542 --> 12:45.625
I...wish
you were my dad.

12:45.625 --> 12:46.667
W...hat?

12:46.667 --> 12:50.000
You know --
so...I could date you.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.333
Oh.

12:53.917 --> 12:55.250
What the hell
is this?!

12:55.250 --> 12:56.667
Holding hands?

12:56.667 --> 12:58.458
You strumpets!

12:58.458 --> 13:00.166
And what is
that smell?!

13:00.166 --> 13:02.542
I-I'm -- I'm sorry!
Dad, I-I -- I don't --

13:02.542 --> 13:04.083
I should have
seen this coming.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.834
You've had
way too much freedom lately.

13:05.834 --> 13:07.625
I'm moving you
back into my bedroom!

13:07.625 --> 13:10.834
If anybody should move
into your bedroom, it's me, sir.

13:10.834 --> 13:14.208
I made Shannon hold hands,
and I wanted more!

13:15.166 --> 13:16.709
We should have never
let a boy join!

13:16.709 --> 13:17.834
He's obsessed!

13:17.834 --> 13:19.750
Soiling the sanctity
of the group

13:19.750 --> 13:21.583
and horning in
on our chicks!

13:21.583 --> 13:23.875
Out!
Both of you!

13:23.875 --> 13:25.583
But then
I'll have to give him the talk.

13:26.917 --> 13:28.709
Damn it, I lost my watch!

13:28.709 --> 13:31.125
Get over here, son.
You've got small hands.

13:32.875 --> 13:35.250
Wait! There must be something
we can do to stay!

13:35.250 --> 13:39.500
There is...
one thing you can do.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.083
Sex Aversion
Therapy Camp?!

13:42.083 --> 13:44.625
You say that like
it's a bad thing. Try this.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.875
Sex Aversion Therapy Camp!

13:51.875 --> 13:53.792
Wha-- Wha--
What is this?!

13:53.792 --> 13:55.875
I don't need
sex-aversion therapy!

13:57.333 --> 13:59.583
That's a handsome couple.

13:59.583 --> 14:02.208
Pretty beach.
Wonder where that is.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.417
Oh. Well, now they're --

14:03.417 --> 14:05.625
now they're taking it
to the bedroom.

14:05.625 --> 14:08.500
Ooh. Little PG-13.

14:08.500 --> 14:11.500
Ooh!
Off comes the bra!

14:11.500 --> 14:13.917
Hmm. Maybe this --
maybe this camp isn't so bad.

14:15.083 --> 14:16.500
Oh, gross!

14:17.875 --> 14:19.667
Stop! Turn it off!

14:21.875 --> 14:24.375
Sweet Jesus, have mercy!

14:25.375 --> 14:26.709
Blaaaah!

14:26.709 --> 14:28.709
Euggggh!

14:28.709 --> 14:31.208
Aaagh!
Ohhhh! Aaagh!

14:31.208 --> 14:33.667
Please, stop! Stop it!

14:33.667 --> 14:37.166
Please, stop showing me photos
of that hideous woman!

14:37.166 --> 14:39.333
Eugggggaaaaaaaaah!

14:40.834 --> 14:43.750
I can't believe our slide
actually got a guy killed.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.166
What if
somebody finds out?!

14:45.166 --> 14:46.834
Everybody,
just be cool!

14:46.834 --> 14:50.291
If we all did our job, no one's
going to find out anything.

14:50.291 --> 14:52.417
I buried our bathing suits
and the tools.

14:52.417 --> 14:54.542
I cut Kyle's body into pieces

14:54.542 --> 14:56.125
and dissolved it
in acid.

14:56.125 --> 14:57.542
And I have
every intention

14:57.542 --> 14:59.125
of getting rid
of his board shorts.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.417
Then that's
everything.

15:00.417 --> 15:02.500
There's not a single
shred of evidence

15:02.500 --> 15:04.125
linking us
to his death.

15:04.125 --> 15:05.458
This your slide?

15:05.458 --> 15:07.000
Mother.
The slide.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.458
We forgot
about the slide!

15:08.458 --> 15:10.875
Dirk Turlington,
waterpark detective.

15:10.875 --> 15:13.291
Got a report of a man missing
after riding a waterslide.

15:13.291 --> 15:14.834
Well, not ours!

15:14.834 --> 15:16.875
This is a slide town,
guy!

15:16.875 --> 15:19.458
Swing a dead Kyle,
and you'll hit one.

15:19.458 --> 15:22.625
I, uh...never mentioned
the name Kyle.

15:22.625 --> 15:24.834
These board shorts
are mine!

15:29.709 --> 15:31.000
Great.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.250
You folks have yourselves
a wonderful day.

15:33.250 --> 15:35.375
Turlington exits.

15:35.375 --> 15:38.542
Did he just say,
"Turlington exits"?

15:41.083 --> 15:43.000
And...done.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.625
Again, I apologize.
That's never happened before.

15:45.625 --> 15:46.750
Mr. Smith?

15:47.834 --> 15:50.834
There's, uh...
my boy.

15:50.834 --> 15:52.542
You, uh --
You looked tired.

15:52.542 --> 15:53.959
Camp must have
been fun.

15:53.959 --> 15:56.834
Steve...pure.

15:56.834 --> 15:58.959
I bet you got in a prank war
with those preppies

15:58.959 --> 16:01.625
at the Gay Conversion Therapy
Camp across the lake!

16:05.083 --> 16:06.959
Let's get this slide
down fast.

16:06.959 --> 16:08.667
That detective
gave me the creeps.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.375
Which detective?

16:10.375 --> 16:11.583
Is the gate open?

16:11.583 --> 16:13.583
It's like Grand Central
back here.

16:13.583 --> 16:15.291
Forensics came back
from the lab --

16:15.291 --> 16:17.458
says that Kyle's flight path
originated...

16:17.458 --> 16:18.959
from this slide.

16:18.959 --> 16:22.000
There's no way!
O-Our slide is totally safe!

16:22.000 --> 16:24.125
Great. Then I can
close the case.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.417
Right after one of you
goes down it.

16:26.417 --> 16:28.208
No problem.

16:28.208 --> 16:30.166
Oh, you bitch!

16:34.208 --> 16:36.500
Just gonna test the water.

16:42.875 --> 16:44.417
Cool!

Okay,
it's...slidin' time, y'all.

He did it!
Alright, Roger!

16:59.125 --> 17:02.041
Well, I guess
I had it all wrong.

17:02.041 --> 17:03.417
Case closed.

17:03.417 --> 17:04.709
Unsolved.

17:04.709 --> 17:06.166
Cold as chowder.

17:06.166 --> 17:08.417
I'm a cold-chowder man.

17:08.417 --> 17:11.250
You can really taste the clams
that way.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.166
Mmmmm.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.208
Roger,
are you okay?

17:16.208 --> 17:18.083
That sounded...
awful.

17:18.083 --> 17:20.166
I'm cool. My hands
took the worst of it.

can't fix.

17:30.792 --> 17:33.375
The beginnings of these dances
are always so awkward.

dads on the other.

17:36.125 --> 17:37.917
Everyone's all nervous.

My trick? Picture them
in their underwear.

Yeah, that's...

Uh...thanks.

Alright, fathers,
find your daughters or son,

18:01.709 --> 18:06.709
because it's time for
the ceremonial purity dance.

18:12.375 --> 18:14.667
Hey, bud.
May I have this dance?

18:14.667 --> 18:15.917
Okay.

18:15.917 --> 18:18.583
Oh! Coming on
a little strong, son.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.792
I won't feel sick
if I don't look at them.

out of control.

No, I was the one
with the problem.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.583
I was so worried
I might screw you up

18:48.583 --> 18:50.291
that I got you involved
in this craziness,

even worse!

are natural!

the information and the space

19:44.542 --> 19:46.583
to safely explore
those feelings,

19:46.583 --> 19:48.166
because they're people,

20:34.083 --> 20:36.959
I put so much pressure
on having the talk,

20:36.959 --> 20:38.875
but there shouldn't be
one talk.

20:38.875 --> 20:40.208
It should be talks.

20:40.208 --> 20:41.917
I may not have
every answer,

20:41.917 --> 20:45.208
but if you have questions,
you can always ask me.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.000
I do have
one question.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.041
May I have
this dance?

20:53.834 --> 20:56.041
Thanks for making me
horny again, Dad.

20:57.208 --> 20:58.959
And...I'm out.

21:01.166 --> 21:05.166
Have a great night!

21:05.166 --> 21:07.125
