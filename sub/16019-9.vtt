WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:03.044
(June) NOW THAT I'M

00:01.710 --> 00:03.044
IN THE BUSINESS WORLD AGAIN,

00:03.086 --> 00:05.631
IT'S MY JOB TO DISTINGUISH

00:03.086 --> 00:05.631
MYSELF FROM THE HERD,

00:05.673 --> 00:08.216
TO ESTABLISH MY OWN IDENTITY

00:05.673 --> 00:08.216
AND BREAK OUT FROM THE PACK--

00:08.258 --> 00:10.761
WHICH IS HARD

00:08.258 --> 00:10.761
FOR MOST PEOPLE TO DO.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.348
OF COURSE,

00:12.137 --> 00:14.348
MOST PEOPLE AREN'T CHLOE.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.057
HEY!

SO THERE'S THIS ABANDONED

00:18.101 --> 00:21.104
SUBWAY STATION IN FLATBUSH.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.064
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE?

00:21.146 --> 00:23.064
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:23.106 --> 00:25.108
ANYWAY, SO I SHOW UP

00:23.106 --> 00:25.108
WITH A TON OF LICORICE.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.068
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN "BECKER"?

00:27.110 --> 00:28.069
I DON'T HAVE TIME

00:27.110 --> 00:28.069
FOR ANY OF YOUR CRAZY STORIES.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.113
MR. HARKIN MADE ME NUMBER TWO

00:28.111 --> 00:30.113
ON A BIG PRESENTATION,

00:30.155 --> 00:31.699
AND I HAVE

00:30.155 --> 00:31.699
A TON OF WORK TO DO.

00:31.740 --> 00:32.992
I HADN'T

00:31.740 --> 00:32.992
SEEN "BECKER" EITHER,

00:33.033 --> 00:35.076
WHICH IS WHAT I WAS

00:33.033 --> 00:35.076
TELLING THIS KOREAN D.J.--

00:35.118 --> 00:36.704

00:43.126 --> 00:44.294
IN THERE?

00:44.336 --> 00:46.087

00:44.336 --> 00:46.087
IT'S THE ACOUSTICS OR WHAT,

00:46.129 --> 00:47.088
BUT WHEN YOU SLAM THE DOOR,

00:47.130 --> 00:49.884
IT'S ACTUALLY LIKE

00:47.130 --> 00:49.884
A STRAIGHT SHOT INTO MY EARDRUM.

00:49.925 --> 00:52.511
OKAY? IT'S  RIGHT HERE.

You just need to hear me.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.147
YOU CANNOT COME BY HERE.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.357

05:17.234 --> 05:18.819

05:18.860 --> 05:21.362

05:21.404 --> 05:23.573
(both exhale deeply)

05:23.615 --> 05:25.366
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.286

05:25.408 --> 05:27.286
OF OUR HONEYMOON.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.286
YEAH.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.455
THE FIRST TWO NIGHTS, MY MOM WAS

05:27.327 --> 05:30.455
STILL SHARING OUR HOTEL ROOM.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.999
OH, MY GOD.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.375
EXCUSE ME. UM, I HAVEN'T

05:32.040 --> 05:34.375
DRANK IN A WHILE.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.585
I'M GONNA GO USE

05:34.417 --> 05:35.585
THE RESTROOM.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.004
(chuckles)

05:38.713 --> 05:40.423
(toilet flushes)

05:40.465 --> 05:41.382
(faucet running)

05:41.424 --> 05:43.468
(sighs) OHH.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.386
I FEEL A LITTLE LIGHT-HEADED.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.431
BUT IT'S OKAY.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.431
I'LL JUST SEGUE TO TEA

05:48.473 --> 05:51.476
AND GET THOSE FILES

05:48.473 --> 05:51.476
OVER TO HARKIN.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.321
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

06:02.361 --> 06:03.446
YOU LANDED YOSHIDA.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.406
BUT--BUT THE YOSHIDA MEETING

06:03.488 --> 06:05.406
ISN'T UNTIL MONDAY.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.908
YEAH, AND TODAY'S TUESDAY.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.244
I--WH-WHAT HAPPENED TO BRUNCH?

06:09.286 --> 06:11.579

06:20.964 --> 06:23.008
JUNE, CONGRATS ON YOSHIDA!

06:23.050 --> 06:25.426
AND I TOLD MY HUSBAND WHAT YOU

06:23.050 --> 06:25.426
SAID ON MONDAY, AND HE AGREED.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.221
CANCELED THE ADOPTION.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.221
(laughs)

06:27.262 --> 06:30.682
GOOD! A LOT HAPPENED ON MONDAY,

06:27.262 --> 06:30.682

06:45.572 --> 06:47.366
OH. YOU WERE BLACKED OUT

06:45.572 --> 06:47.366
FOR TWO DAYS.

06:47.406 --> 06:48.825
WHY?!

06:47.406 --> 06:48.825
THE LAST THING I REMEMBER

06:48.867 --> 06:50.451
WAS BEING IN THE BATHROOM

06:48.867 --> 06:50.451
AT BRUNCH.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.494
YEAH, SO IMMEDIATELY

06:50.493 --> 06:51.494
BEFORE THAT,

06:51.536 --> 06:53.621
I "BLACK LIGHTNINGED" YOU.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.956

11:12.964 --> 11:14.633
TO THE FARMER'S MARKET,

11:14.673 --> 11:16.717
GET YOU A NICE

11:14.673 --> 11:16.717
WHOLE ROASTED CHICKEN.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.717
OOH!

11:16.759 --> 11:19.346
THAT'S ALL MY MOM ATE,

11:16.759 --> 11:19.346
AND LOOK AT ME. I'M IN A LIMO.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.431
COME ON, HOP IN.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.431
OKAY.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.518
(speaking indistinctly)

11:24.559 --> 11:25.726
(Allen gasps)

11:24.559 --> 11:25.726
OH, YOU'RE THE--

11:25.768 --> 11:26.769
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:26.811 --> 11:28.104
(gasps) YOUR PIG CAME.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.649
WE HEARD SNORTING,

11:28.146 --> 11:30.649
SO WE OPENED THE BOX.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.942
I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVER

11:30.689 --> 11:32.942
USED TO HATE YOU, JUNE.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.735
NOW YOU HAVE A PIG. (gasps)

11:34.777 --> 11:36.321
(giggles)

11:34.777 --> 11:36.321
WHAT THE HELL?

11:36.363 --> 11:37.989
2-DAY DELIVERY. YOU MUST'VE

11:36.363 --> 11:37.989
ORDERED HIM ON MONDAY.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.449
(whispers) MONDAY.

11:39.491 --> 11:41.742
IS THAT HIS NAME?

11:39.491 --> 11:41.742
THAT'S A CUTE NAME.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.662
MONDAY THE PIG.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.662
GREAT PIG.

11:43.702 --> 11:46.747
JUNE, TELL THE GUYS FROM H.R.

11:43.702 --> 11:46.747
THEY HAVEN'T HEARD IT.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.208
HEARD WHAT?

11:48.249 --> 11:50.001
(laughing) THE DIRTY JOKE

11:48.249 --> 11:50.001
YOU TOLD ON MONDAY!

11:48.249 --> 11:50.001
(Allen laughs)

11:50.043 --> 11:52.045
SO  FILTHY!

11:52.086 --> 11:54.589
I STARTED TO TELL IT,

11:52.086 --> 11:54.589
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY A BOSS JOKE,

11:54.631 --> 11:56.799
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.799
GO AHEAD.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.426
(laughs)

12:01.012 --> 12:02.805
SO, UM...

12:01.012 --> 12:02.805
(clears throat)

12:02.847 --> 12:05.684
THIS, UM...

12:02.847 --> 12:05.684
(pig snorting)

12:05.724 --> 12:06.809
MEXICAN...

12:06.851 --> 12:08.019
OH. HA!

12:08.061 --> 12:09.937
THAT WALKS INTO A...

12:09.979 --> 12:11.189
(snorting continues)

12:11.231 --> 12:13.732
PENIS...

12:16.903 --> 12:19.864
JUNE, EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

12:16.903 --> 12:19.864
YOU SEEM A LITTLE OFF TODAY.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.242
NO. YES. OH, I-I AM NOT OFF.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.242
I AM ON.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.661
I AM--I AM SUPER ON.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.661
GOOD.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.787
BRING THAT ENERGY TO DINNER

12:24.703 --> 12:26.787
WITH YOSHIDA TONIGHT.

12:26.829 --> 12:27.955
DINNER?

12:27.997 --> 12:29.207
THEY WANT YOU TO WALK THEM

12:27.997 --> 12:29.207
THROUGH YOUR PROPOSAL

12:29.249 --> 12:30.791
STEP-BY-STEP.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.002
RIGHT! MY PROPOSAL!

12:30.833 --> 12:33.002
MY MONDAY PROPOSAL.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.672
(chuckles) MONDAY JUST

12:33.044 --> 12:35.672
DOESN'T END, DOES IT?

12:35.714 --> 12:37.965
JUST BRING THIS THING HOME.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.965
I TRUST YOU,

12:38.007 --> 12:40.427
SENIOR JUNIOR ANALYST

12:38.007 --> 12:40.427
JUNE COLBURN.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.679
(slaps back)

12:40.468 --> 12:42.679
(chuckles)

12:42.721 --> 12:45.973
(snorting)

12:46.015 --> 12:47.308
I'M DONE HOLDING HIM.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.351
(door slams)

12:53.314 --> 12:54.815
OKAY, JUNE.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.818
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU

12:54.857 --> 12:57.818
PITCHED TO THESE GUYS ON MONDAY,

12:57.860 --> 12:59.487
BUT YOU CAN WING IT.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.989
YOU CAN CHANNEL MONDAY, JUNE.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.989
SHE IS IN THERE.

13:02.031 --> 13:05.452
YOU CAN DO THIS.

13:02.031 --> 13:05.452
YOU CAN CLOSE THIS DEAL.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.828
(whispers)

13:05.493 --> 13:07.828
NO, YOU CAN'T.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.664
THAT WAS MY MIRROR VOICE,

13:09.706 --> 13:11.416
BUT I SHARE

13:09.706 --> 13:11.416
THE MIRROR'S OPINION.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.501
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE

13:11.458 --> 13:13.501
TO WORK WASTED.

13:13.543 --> 13:14.835
HEY, I AM UNDER

13:13.543 --> 13:14.835
A LOT OF PRESSURE.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.421
I DO NOT NEED JUDGMENT FROM YOU.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.839
HEY! DON'T YOU SNAP AT ELI.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.258
THIS IS NOT HIS FAULT.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.258
IT'S MINE.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.510
SO YOU POINT THAT MAD FACE

13:20.300 --> 13:22.510
THIS WAY.

13:22.552 --> 13:23.844
(cell phone rings)

13:23.886 --> 13:26.847
(ring)

13:23.886 --> 13:26.847
IT'S MARK AGAIN.

13:26.889 --> 13:27.848
(beep)

13:26.889 --> 13:27.848
HELLO?

13:27.890 --> 13:30.727
HI, THE BOOTY.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.727
BET YOU WANNA TALK TO CUTIE.

13:30.769 --> 13:31.894
SHE'S RIGHT HERE.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.854
NO, I DON'T--

13:33.896 --> 13:35.022
HI, MARK.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.316
I BOOKED THE HOTEL ROOM.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.067
OH. OKAY.

13:38.109 --> 13:40.945
THAT--THAT SOUNDS LIKE

13:38.109 --> 13:40.945
SOMETHING THAT WE... DISCUSSED.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.572
SO MEET THERE TONIGHT?

13:42.614 --> 13:44.574
WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN,

13:42.614 --> 13:44.574
LIKE YOU SAID MONDAY.

13:44.616 --> 13:45.908
OKAY. GOTTA GO. BYE!

13:44.616 --> 13:45.908
(beep)

13:45.950 --> 13:48.662
OH, GOD.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.662
I GOTTA DEAL WITH THAT.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.246
BUT FIRST, I GOTTA DEAL

13:48.703 --> 13:50.246
WITH THE YOSHIDA ACCOUNT.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.540
IT'S GONNA GO YOSHIDA, MARK,

13:50.288 --> 13:52.540
THE PIG,

13:52.582 --> 13:53.916
THE GRASS STAINS

13:52.582 --> 13:53.916
ON MY CLOTHES.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.960
I'M THE ONE

13:53.958 --> 13:55.960
THAT ORDERED YOU THAT PIG!

13:56.002 --> 13:57.962
I MEANT FOR IT TO BE

13:56.002 --> 13:57.962
A PANDA!

13:58.004 --> 14:00.507
I CHECKED THE WRONG BOX.

14:00.548 --> 14:01.882
(woman on TV) YOUR BABY IS

14:01.924 --> 14:03.301
NOW ABOUT THE SIZE

14:01.924 --> 14:03.301
OF A KIDNEY BEAN

14:03.343 --> 14:04.469
AND IS CONSTANTLY MOVING.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.805
WELL, WE'RE GONNA GET GOING.

14:06.845 --> 14:08.889
BUT YOU'RE ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH

14:06.845 --> 14:08.889
"HEALTHY MOMMY, HEALTHY BABY."

14:08.931 --> 14:10.266
(baby cries)

14:08.931 --> 14:10.266
(turns off DVD)

14:10.308 --> 14:12.893
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU, JAMES?

14:10.308 --> 14:12.893
WHY DO YOU SEEM SO UPSET?

14:12.935 --> 14:14.979
ALL RIGHT.

14:15.021 --> 14:18.775
(sighs) JUST HEAR ME OUT.

14:15.021 --> 14:18.775
THIS IS DIFFICULT.

14:18.817 --> 14:19.900
I KNOW YOU SAID THERE ISN'T,

14:19.942 --> 14:21.944
BUT THERE'S A SLIGHT CHANCE THAT

14:19.942 --> 14:21.944
THAT BABY COULD BE MINE.

14:21.986 --> 14:25.114
NO. NO, THERE'S NO CHANCE

14:21.986 --> 14:25.114
THE BABY COULD BE YOURS, JAMES.

14:25.156 --> 14:28.117
BUT EVEN IF THERE WAS,

14:25.156 --> 14:28.117
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN HERE?

14:28.159 --> 14:32.079
(sighs deeply)

14:28.159 --> 14:32.079
OKAY, THIS IS...

14:32.121 --> 14:34.207
THIS IS

14:32.121 --> 14:34.207
THE REALLY DIFFICULT PART.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.917
DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,

14:34.248 --> 14:36.917
BUT I...

14:36.959 --> 14:40.129
I DON'T THINK

14:36.959 --> 14:40.129
YOU WILL BE A GOOD MOTHER.

14:40.171 --> 14:41.964
WHAT?

14:40.171 --> 14:41.964
I'M JUST SAYING,

14:42.006 --> 14:44.342
I-I DON'T THINK

14:42.006 --> 14:44.342
YOU'LL BE A GOOD MOTHER.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.553
I-I...

14:46.594 --> 14:47.928
DON'T...

14:47.970 --> 14:49.389
THINK YOU'LL BE

14:47.970 --> 14:49.389
A GOOD MOTHER.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.598
(scoffs)

14:49.430 --> 14:50.598
(stammers)

14:50.640 --> 14:51.932
NO OTHER WORDS ARE

14:50.640 --> 14:51.932
REVEALING THEMSELVES TO ME

14:51.974 --> 14:52.933
TO CONVEY THIS TO YOU.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.227
I THINK

14:52.975 --> 14:54.227
THIS IS WHEN WE LEAVE.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.937
I CANNOT BELIEVE I WASTED

14:54.268 --> 14:56.937
MY FREEBIE ON YOU, JAMES.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.105
COME ON.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.105
W--

14:58.147 --> 14:59.940
(sighs)

14:58.147 --> 14:59.940
I MEAN, CRISSY, WAIT.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.317
WAIT. WAIT.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.944
I...

15:03.986 --> 15:05.572
DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE

15:03.986 --> 15:05.572
A GOOD MOTHER.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.575
(Crissy sobs)

15:08.616 --> 15:09.909
(door slams)

15:11.494 --> 15:14.038
SO ALTHOUGH THE POTENTIAL

15:11.494 --> 15:14.038
FOR PROFIT IS EXTREMELY HIGH...

15:14.080 --> 15:15.164
SO EXCITING. IT'S JUST LIKE

15:14.080 --> 15:15.164
YOU SAID ON MONDAY.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.667
YOUR POTENTIAL FOR BANKRUPTCY

15:15.206 --> 15:17.667
IS ALSO VERY HIGH.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.919
YOU COULD LOSE EVERYTHING.

15:21.671 --> 15:25.341
OR  YOU COULD QUADRUPLE

15:21.671 --> 15:25.341
YOUR INVESTMENT IN THREE MONTHS.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.134
HIGH-RISK, HIGH-REWARD.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.386
YOU BELIEVE IN THIS STRATEGY,

15:27.176 --> 15:28.386
RIGHT?

15:28.428 --> 15:29.888
YOU THINK THIS IS

15:28.428 --> 15:29.888
THE WAY TO GO?

15:29.929 --> 15:32.223
ARIGATO!

15:29.929 --> 15:32.223
(singsongy) HEY!

15:32.265 --> 15:34.016
HI. WHAT ARE WE DRINKIN'?

15:34.058 --> 15:35.393
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.978
I WAS JUST OUT.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.978
I MISSED YOU.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.773
WHAT?

15:38.020 --> 15:39.773
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME WEIRD.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.482
JUNE, CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU?

15:41.524 --> 15:42.983
(chuckles)

15:44.277 --> 15:46.987
IS THAT MINERVA?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.987
WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING HERE?

15:47.029 --> 15:49.282
AND WHY IS IT TAKING YOU SO LONG

15:47.029 --> 15:49.282
TO CLOSE THIS THING?

15:49.323 --> 15:51.409
WHERE'S THAT MONDAY DAZZLE?

15:51.451 --> 15:52.993
THE DAZZLE IS STILL HERE, SIR.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.993
IT'S JUST--

15:53.035 --> 15:55.246
IT'S MORE... IT'S NUANCED.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.917
I DON'T WANT NUANCED DAZZLE.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.917
I WANT RAZZLE-DAZZLE!

15:58.958 --> 16:02.169
WELL, THEN GET OUT OF HERE.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.169
LET ME WORK MY MAGIC.

16:02.211 --> 16:05.089
YOUR BOSS ENERGY IS PUTTING

16:02.211 --> 16:05.089
A DAMPER ON THE DAZZLE.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.507
YOU ARE

16:05.131 --> 16:06.507
FREAKING EVERYBODY OUT.

16:06.549 --> 16:09.218
THERE'S THAT MONDAY DAZZLE.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.011
CLOSE  THIS DEAL.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.013
BRING HOME

16:11.053 --> 16:13.013
THE HEAD OF THE BULL.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.725
SEVER THE NECK OF THE SERPENT

16:13.055 --> 16:15.725
WITH THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES!

16:15.767 --> 16:17.936
NOW GET OUT OF HERE,

16:15.767 --> 16:17.936
OLD MAN LINGO.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.687
(laughs)

16:22.941 --> 16:24.233
OH, GOD.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.110
SHE KIDNAPPED THEM!

16:28.362 --> 16:30.698
CHLOE, THIS IS THE ONE HUNDREDTH

16:28.362 --> 16:30.698
MESSAGE I'VE LEFT YOU.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.659
I'M NOT ANGRY.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.659
I JUST WANT MY CLIENTS BACK.

16:32.700 --> 16:36.120
HARKIN THINKS THIS IS STILL ALL

16:32.700 --> 16:36.120
PART OF MY MASTER DAZZLE PLAN,

16:36.162 --> 16:39.039
AND--OH, GOD. WHERE HAVE YOU

16:36.162 --> 16:39.039
BEEN?! WHERE ARE MY CLIENTS?!

16:36.162 --> 16:39.039
(beep)

16:39.081 --> 16:40.750
I TOOK THEM TO

16:39.081 --> 16:40.750
AN AFTER-HOURS PARTY.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.209
PRETTY TERRIBLE OF ME, RIGHT?

16:42.251 --> 16:45.505
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF PERSON

16:42.251 --> 16:45.505
WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

16:45.546 --> 16:48.257
WELL, W-W-WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

16:45.546 --> 16:48.257
I NEED TO CLOSE THIS DEAL.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.760
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?!

16:48.299 --> 16:50.760
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:50.802 --> 16:52.094
THEY'RE NOT GONNA CLOSE

16:50.802 --> 16:52.094
THIS DEAL WITH YOU

16:52.136 --> 16:54.681
BECAUSE THEY AGREED TO CLOSE

16:52.136 --> 16:54.681
THIS DEAL WITH MONDAY JUNE.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.557
AND GUESS WHAT?

16:54.722 --> 16:56.557
IT'S THURSDAY.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.058
I AM MONDAY JUNE.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.058
NO.

16:58.100 --> 17:02.104
