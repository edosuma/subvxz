WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:04.880
[Peter yawns]
I wonder if Thomas Edison

00:04.880 --> 00:09.051
stayed up for 47 straight hours
perfecting the light bulb?

00:09.051 --> 00:11.261
[exhales]
Probably not,

00:11.261 --> 00:13.639
'cause as far as I know,
Edison didn't have to

00:13.639 --> 00:16.975
secretly fight crime while
working on his science projects.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.311
But his inventions
did make him money,

00:19.311 --> 00:23.106
which is exactly what I need
this Horizon Open House
project to do.

00:23.106 --> 00:26.318
Corporate sponsors
always attend,
looking for projects to back.

00:26.318 --> 00:29.863
And I need a new way
to pay for school, so some
company has to be blown away‐‐

00:29.863 --> 00:30.948
Ow!

00:30.948 --> 00:33.534
Oh, not literally.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.078
By my new power amplifier.
[beeps]

00:36.078 --> 00:39.748
This thing can increase
the energy output
of almost any electrical device.

00:39.748 --> 00:42.209
And... done!

00:42.209 --> 00:44.211
And I still have...
[gasps]

00:44.211 --> 00:46.713
exactly zero minutes
to spare!

00:46.713 --> 00:48.715
[panting]

00:48.715 --> 00:51.051
[grunting]

00:51.051 --> 00:54.179
Some mysterious villain
put a bounty on Spidey.

00:54.179 --> 00:57.933
But even though sporting
my good old red‐and‐blues
makes me a target,

00:57.933 --> 01:02.229
web‐slinging's the only way
I'll make it to Horizon in time
for tonight's open house.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.569
Oh, man.
I'm so out of it.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.071
Between this project
and the endless villain fights,

01:11.071 --> 01:14.449
the hardest part'll be
staying awake long enough
to present my device.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.245
[sighs]
Almost there.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.998
And nobody trying to stop me.
[chuckles]

01:20.998 --> 01:23.000
Maybe my string
of bad luck's finally...

01:23.000 --> 01:24.376
[yelling]

01:25.836 --> 01:28.338
[grunts]
...hit rock bottom.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.591
[groans]
Supposed to be
clear skies today.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.593
Where'd that lightning
come from?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.595
[woman]
That'd be...

01:35.846 --> 01:37.222
me!

01:37.222 --> 01:39.016
Name's Electro,

01:39.016 --> 01:41.977
and I gotta thank you,
Spider‐Guy.

01:41.977 --> 01:45.230
Uh, thank‐you cards,
thank‐you gifts?
These things are normal.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.190
[evil laughter]

01:47.190 --> 01:50.027
But thank‐you attacks?

01:50.027 --> 01:51.278
[grunts]

01:52.321 --> 01:55.115
[groans]
Not so much.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.242
[yells]

01:59.286 --> 02:02.539
Thing is, the sweet,
sweet bounty cash

02:02.539 --> 02:05.500
I'm gonna get
from turning you in
is gonna fund the completion

02:05.500 --> 02:08.295
of this awesome Electro suit
I invented.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.922
Huh?

02:10.922 --> 02:12.674
Yeah, I was gonna say,
[huffs]

02:12.674 --> 02:15.302
exposed power sources,
inadequate insulation‐‐

02:15.302 --> 02:17.888
That might not be
the safest outfit.
[chuckles]

02:17.888 --> 02:20.766
Oh...
[chuckles]
totally not safe...

02:20.766 --> 02:22.809
[ascending whirring]

02:22.809 --> 02:24.978
for you!
[yells]

02:24.978 --> 02:27.230
That's not what I meant!

02:37.991 --> 02:39.326
[yells]

02:39.326 --> 02:42.204
[grunts]

02:42.204 --> 02:44.206
[grunts]

02:46.792 --> 02:49.169
Made it almost two hours
without getting attacked.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.172
Hey, that's better
than yesterday.
[grunting]

02:52.172 --> 02:55.133
[straining]
Look‐‐ "Electro,"
did you say?

02:55.133 --> 02:58.845
I'd love to have some big,
epic webs‐against‐zaps
battle with you,

02:58.845 --> 03:00.639
but I gotta be somewhere.
Rain check?

03:00.639 --> 03:04.184
Sometimes rain brings lightning!

03:04.184 --> 03:06.603
[grunts]
Aah!

03:06.603 --> 03:08.355
[groans]

03:09.940 --> 03:11.942
[grunts]
Gotta love weather comedy.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.486
[chuckles]
Well, that was easy.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.363
Honestly, Spidey,
I thought

03:16.363 --> 03:18.949
you were gonna play
a little hard to get.
[knuckles crack]

03:18.949 --> 03:21.118
[grunts]
It's been a crazy week!

03:21.118 --> 03:22.953
You try heroing
with no sleep.

03:22.953 --> 03:27.457
Tired? Then I'll
put you down for a nap!

03:27.457 --> 03:31.044
You have no idea
how nice that sounds.
[grunting]

03:31.044 --> 03:33.046
[grunts]

03:33.046 --> 03:34.923
[grunts]
Huh?

03:36.133 --> 03:37.217
Bogus!

03:37.217 --> 03:39.302
Must be the hyper‐conductor
core again.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.763
Come on, Electro,
get it together!

03:41.763 --> 03:43.348
Maybe it's
a capacitor problem.

03:43.348 --> 03:47.394
Have you tried‐‐
Why am I giving
the bad guy suggestions?

03:47.394 --> 03:48.478
Capac‐‐

03:48.478 --> 03:50.355
Oh, maybe.
Let me just‐‐

03:50.355 --> 03:52.149
Ha! Got it.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.901
[yells]
Thanks for the tip.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.112
[cries out]

03:57.112 --> 04:00.031
Ugh! Great!
Now I gotta recharge.

04:00.031 --> 04:02.117
See why I need funding?

04:02.117 --> 04:04.286
[grunts]
[grunts]

04:04.286 --> 04:06.496
Powering up
from an onboard generator?
[grunting]

04:06.496 --> 04:10.375
Can't keep up with
the <i>current</i> situation, huh?
[chuckles]

04:10.375 --> 04:13.295
Okay. That pun
even hurt me a little.
[ascending whirring]

04:13.295 --> 04:16.840
Recharge complete.
[chuckles]
Rad!

04:20.010 --> 04:23.054
Aaah! Whoa!
[grunts]

04:25.223 --> 04:27.684
Huh. What's this
little beauty?

04:27.684 --> 04:30.103
Some kind of power enhancer?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.438
[chuckles]
Wicked.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.482
I've never seen
a build like this.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.359
You don't want that!
It's, uh... boring.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.736
[fake chuckle]
[chuckles]

04:40.322 --> 04:41.448

04:42.908 --> 04:44.951

[laughs]

04:44.951 --> 04:47.287
Boring? Nah.
I'm an engineer.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.164
I love geeky stuff.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.876
[ascending whirring]

04:52.876 --> 04:54.461
Whoa!
[chuckles]

04:54.461 --> 04:56.463
Crazy‐awesome
energy efficiency.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.465
I wonder if I could get
even better results

04:58.465 --> 05:00.675
if I manipulated
the inner manifold.

05:00.675 --> 05:03.261
No!
[grunts]

05:03.261 --> 05:07.182
Your suit's generator
probably can't handle
a surge like that!

05:07.182 --> 05:09.184
It could create
an energy feedback loop that‐‐

05:09.184 --> 05:10.977
Aah!

05:10.977 --> 05:14.815
Electricity coursing through me!

05:14.815 --> 05:17.734
Don't worry.
We'll find a way to fix this.

What? Oh, no.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.333
Don't tell me‐‐

05:33.333 --> 05:36.419
Fix it? Why?
[chuckles]

05:36.419 --> 05:39.005
This is awesome!

05:39.005 --> 05:42.342
So... not... awesome!

Do you think I'll get
a ribbon this year?

05:48.807 --> 05:51.434
Okay, everyone.
We're seconds away

05:51.434 --> 05:53.937
from throwing those doors
wide to the public.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.648
Put the final touches
on your open house projects,

05:56.648 --> 06:00.277
and let's show the world why
Horizon students have the best‐‐

06:00.277 --> 06:02.696

Everyone, get down!

06:08.410 --> 06:11.079
Sorry! Her fault!

06:11.079 --> 06:13.915
Also kind of my fault too.
It‐‐ It's complicated.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.334
[students screaming]

06:19.629 --> 06:23.049
Students, get to safety!
Go, go, go!

06:23.049 --> 06:25.844
My old suit was nothing.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.638
This is true power!

06:28.638 --> 06:30.640
[yells]
Even if I had enough sleep,

06:30.640 --> 06:32.642
I can't go faster
than living energy!
[grunts]

06:34.519 --> 06:37.022
Maybe I can find a way
to contain her.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.608
If only I had the...

06:39.608 --> 06:40.609
parts.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.527
Duh.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.488

Ah, a thermal converter.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.623
Ugh!

Ooh‐hoo! Nice!

Uh...

07:25.445 --> 07:27.489
Gotcha!

Hm?

07:32.744 --> 07:35.664
[growls]

Why am I always
building science projects
under so much pressure?

You can't hide from me!

slip into something

out of school.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.749
All that work

09:00.749 --> 09:03.668
Well, that was
a draining experience.

09:03.668 --> 09:07.338
Ha! And he can still

09:07.338 --> 09:09.674
Spidey! Are you okay?

09:09.674 --> 09:12.177
[groans]
I'm gonna be sore
in the morning.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.930
But here, Max.
There should be enough
electricity in this power cell

09:15.930 --> 09:17.974
to run every project
in the open house.

09:17.974 --> 09:22.687
Yeah, uh,
we're not gonna be able
to hold the open house now.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.356
There's too much damage.

09:25.356 --> 09:28.151
Right. Good point.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.153
I'm really sorry
this happened.

09:30.153 --> 09:33.156
I know you were just
trying to stop her,

09:33.156 --> 09:36.159
but I don't know
if they do.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.620
Oh, uh...
[nervous chuckle]
hey, guys.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.789
Today we all
stopped Electro.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.791
Your inventions
saved the day.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.710
So you get,
like, a double A.
Like the battery.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.295
Sorry.

09:51.674 --> 09:55.345
So I might not know if Edison
stayed up for 47 straight hours

09:55.345 --> 09:56.888
working on the light bulb,

09:56.888 --> 09:59.599
but one thing
I do know for certain:

09:59.599 --> 10:03.353
Edison never had
an invention destroyed,
and his life nearly ruined,

10:03.353 --> 10:06.564
by a series of costumed maniacs
bent on his destruction.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.943
It's time to find out who sent
all these clowns after me,

10:09.943 --> 10:13.196
and put an end to it
once and for all!

10:15.365 --> 10:18.785
The Horizon High Open House
was an absolute disaster.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.995
My project was fried,
the event was destroyed,

10:20.995 --> 10:24.082
and now I have no idea
how to earn money for tuition.

10:24.082 --> 10:27.127
But at least now that it's over,
I have time to figure out
who sent Electro

10:27.127 --> 10:29.754
and all those other
lunatic villains after me.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.798
Starting at this warehouse.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.384
According to Prowler,
this is the secret meeting place

10:34.384 --> 10:36.678
where someone put
a bounty on me.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.013
No security. No thugs.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.015
No problem.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.645
Okay, Spidey.
Time to play detective.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.608
Mm. Mm‐hmm.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.319
Just as I suspected.
Dust.

10:53.319 --> 10:56.865
And in here?
Empty box.

10:56.865 --> 11:00.201
Whoever operated out of
this place was a professional,
I'll give 'em that.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.623
[trilling]
Wait a second.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.375
Did I just strike gold?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.086
And by "gold," I mean...

11:11.129 --> 11:13.131
a computer data drive?

11:13.131 --> 11:16.134
Property of the <i>Daily Bugle.</i>

11:20.263 --> 11:23.725
I sold them this footage.
Wait.

11:23.725 --> 11:27.687
J. Jonah Jameson keeps trying
