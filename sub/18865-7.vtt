WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:04.103
(Car rumbles)

00:05.505 --> 00:07.706
(Brakes squeak)

00:09.543 --> 00:11.610
- Okay well, you could've
dropped me off back there!

00:11.645 --> 00:13.011
- Oh, don't be silly honey,

00:13.046 --> 00:15.080
we're happy to drive you
right to the door.

00:15.115 --> 00:17.582
- Yeah, this is an iconic
moment in all of our lives,

00:17.617 --> 00:19.451
and I think we should
experience it to the fullest.

00:19.486 --> 00:21.620
Moira: We're very proud of you,
Alexis.

00:21.655 --> 00:22.621
- Thank you.

00:22.656 --> 00:25.657
- Is that appropriate attire
for high school,

00:25.692 --> 00:27.025
do you think?

00:27.060 --> 00:28.693
- Yeah well, what's wrong
with it?!
- Well...

00:28.728 --> 00:30.395
- Well, now you're making
me nervous!

00:30.430 --> 00:31.563
- Anyway, just don't
trust anyone

00:31.598 --> 00:33.465
that wants to be your friend
on the first day, okay?

00:33.500 --> 00:35.667
- And you mustn't let anyone
push you around,

00:35.702 --> 00:38.270
I will not relive that
bullying nightmare.

00:38.305 --> 00:39.304
- I wasn't bullied.

00:39.339 --> 00:40.739
- She doesn't mean you, Alexis.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.141
- Uh, it wasn't that bad.

00:43.176 --> 00:44.309
- That's the heartbreaking part,

00:44.344 --> 00:46.445
He was so blissfully unaware.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.447
- Okay, I'm gonna go.
- Ugh!

00:48.482 --> 00:50.415
- Okay, I think you're brave.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.417
- Well, that's very nice of you
to say, David.

00:52.452 --> 00:53.685
- Okay, he's being sarcastic!

00:53.720 --> 00:55.420
- What?!
- Oh.
- It's a defense mechanism.

00:55.455 --> 00:58.156
From all the bullying.
- Oh my God!

00:58.191 --> 01:01.527
♪♪

01:03.296 --> 01:04.663
(Dog barks)

01:07.134 --> 01:10.035
- (Sighs) I can't tell
what's more tragic,

01:10.070 --> 01:12.971
the fact that the only store
in town is closing,

01:13.006 --> 01:14.406
or that they've...

01:14.441 --> 01:18.310
decided to display fungal cream
beside the cereal boxes.

01:18.345 --> 01:20.278
- That's actually
really convenient,

01:20.313 --> 01:22.114
because I forgot to have
breakfast,

01:22.149 --> 01:23.315
and I'm running low
on fungal cream, so...

01:23.350 --> 01:25.016
- I don't wanna hear you say
fungal again.

01:25.051 --> 01:26.184
- Fungal?

01:26.219 --> 01:28.987
- Yeah, it's like they knew
what the consumer wanted,

01:29.022 --> 01:32.057
and then ran in the opposite
direction.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.493
- Finding everything okay?
- Yes. Yeah.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.294
- It's sad about the store.

01:36.329 --> 01:38.530
- Thank you, it's been
very hard.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.632
- Yeah, I can imagine.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.502
- Yeah, they just missed
the mark, you know?

01:43.537 --> 01:45.403
I mean, this store
in the right hands

01:45.438 --> 01:47.239
could be very lucrative.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.374
- Uh huh, and by the right
hands, you mean your hands?

01:49.409 --> 01:51.042
- Well, I mean someone
with faultless taste

01:51.077 --> 01:52.577
who understands what people
want and need,

01:52.612 --> 01:55.480
and if those happen to be
my hands, then...

01:55.515 --> 01:57.649
- So why don't you do
something about it?

01:57.684 --> 01:59.184
- I'm pretty sure telling them
that they've driven

01:59.219 --> 02:00.185
their store into the ground

02:00.220 --> 02:01.419
might be rubbing salt
in the wound.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.455
- No, I'm saying ever since
you walked in here

02:03.490 --> 02:05.624
you've been talking about
how you would've done things
differently,

02:05.659 --> 02:07.693
so now's your chance.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.228
- Okay, your eyebrows
never move,

02:10.263 --> 02:12.664
so I can't tell whether
you're being serious or not.

02:12.699 --> 02:14.432
- I think you should put
what little money you have

02:14.467 --> 02:16.735
where your mouth is.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.970
- I do have a very good idea.

02:19.005 --> 02:20.338
- What you lack in most things,

02:20.373 --> 02:22.574
you make up for
in unsubstantiated confidence.

02:22.609 --> 02:23.608
- Okay, are we good to go?!

02:23.643 --> 02:25.510
Jocelyn: Good morning, class.

02:25.545 --> 02:27.212
I'm sure you have all noticed

02:27.247 --> 02:29.648
there's a new student
in our midst.

02:29.683 --> 02:33.485
let's give a warm welcome
to Alexis Rose.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.287
She is here until the end
of the semester

02:35.322 --> 02:37.289
to finish her diploma.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.690
(Applause)

02:40.293 --> 02:42.494
Okay, so let's open our books.

02:42.529 --> 02:46.264
- Oh um, I'd just like
to say a few words.

02:46.299 --> 02:48.533
- Okay, we're actually just
running a little bit behind.

02:48.568 --> 02:49.768
- Hey.
- Oh.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.604
- So as Jocelyn said,
my name is Alexis,

02:52.639 --> 02:55.073
and yes, I did not finish
high school.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.642
Um, it's this long, boring
story involving a yacht,

02:57.677 --> 02:59.311
and a famous soccer player,

02:59.346 --> 03:00.612
and like...

03:00.647 --> 03:02.447
a ton of mushrooms.

03:02.482 --> 03:04.282
anyway, I think it would
be so great

03:04.317 --> 03:05.450
if we could just
go around the room,

03:05.485 --> 03:07.185
and everyone could tell me like,

03:07.220 --> 03:09.087
five things about yourself.

03:09.122 --> 03:12.290
Jocelyn: Actually, we don't
have time for that today.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.526
Maybe you could talk
between classes,

03:14.561 --> 03:17.295
or after school,
or on the weekends.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.431
- Yeah, totally.
- Yeah. Okay.

03:19.466 --> 03:22.000
- So just find me
after class, or...

03:24.070 --> 03:25.270
Ivan: Good morning, Twyla.

03:25.305 --> 03:28.340
Sorry I'm late,
but I have morning muffins.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.441
- Oh, thanks, Ivan.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.376
Yeah, they keep selling out.

03:31.411 --> 03:32.677
- Ivan!

03:32.712 --> 03:34.379
Bob's friend?
- Oh yeah!

03:34.414 --> 03:36.147
- Johnny Rose, remember?

03:36.182 --> 03:37.115
- Bagels, I know, yes.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.284
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, bagels.

03:39.319 --> 03:42.120
Oh, I see you have
a new enterprise.

03:42.155 --> 03:45.557
- Yeah, it was always my dream
to bake muffins.

03:45.592 --> 03:46.725
- Well, funny you should
mention it,

03:46.760 --> 03:49.728
because I'm thinking of doing
a continental breakfast

03:49.763 --> 03:50.729
at the motel,

03:50.764 --> 03:52.364
and this could be uh...
very helpful.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.733
- Yeah. I not make breakfast.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.136
- No, no, no,
a continental breakfast,

03:58.171 --> 04:00.472
just pastries and coffee.

04:00.507 --> 04:02.240
- No coffee.

04:02.275 --> 04:05.210
- Oh, I wouldn't expect you
to make the coffee.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.380
- No, I make coffee,
but only for myself.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.315
- Yeah, no, no, it's just
your muffins

04:10.350 --> 04:12.550
that I'm interested in.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.052
- I bake for Twyla.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.588
- Oh, but it's always nice
to have new customers.

04:16.623 --> 04:19.491
- Yes, yes, I think we should
talk about this, Ivan.

04:19.526 --> 04:22.261
Yeah, I'd love to see
your operation.

04:23.430 --> 04:27.065
- Uh yeah, yeah, yeah,
just come by place

04:27.100 --> 04:28.967
and I show you kitchen.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.636
Yes. Yeah.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.505
Well, yeah, okay.
- Good, yes.

04:34.741 --> 04:36.408
- Yes, see you.
- Bye!

04:36.443 --> 04:38.277
- So long.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.514
- Wow, this could be
very exciting.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.115
You know, a continental
breakfast could add

04:44.150 --> 04:46.151
an extra star on our rating.

04:46.186 --> 04:50.422
- Oh wow, so how many stars
would that give you?

04:50.457 --> 04:52.123
- One.

04:52.158 --> 04:54.259
Roland: So, there are carols
playing,

04:54.294 --> 04:57.329
and it snows inside
all day long.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.997
- Gwen's gonna lose her mind!

04:59.032 --> 05:02.467
- Shh! Shh! Shh!

05:02.502 --> 05:03.568
- What now?!

05:03.603 --> 05:05.470
- No need to terminate
your chitter-chatter

05:05.505 --> 05:07.105
on our accounts.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.674
- You gonna tell them,
or should I?

05:09.709 --> 05:12.277
- Ladies, um we have
some good news...

05:12.312 --> 05:14.646
- Christmas world!
Moving into town!

05:14.681 --> 05:17.248
- Bob, okay, there's a way
to do these things,

05:17.283 --> 05:19.184
and I'm the one who's supposed
to lead these meetings,

05:19.219 --> 05:20.118
all right?

05:20.154 --> 05:21.619
- They wanna take over
the general store.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.521
- Bob!
- I'm sorry!

05:23.556 --> 05:26.191
- It's just, you know,
it's big news.

05:26.226 --> 05:29.194
- And what on earth
is a Christmas World?

05:29.229 --> 05:31.563
- They sell Christmas stuff
all year round.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.331
- But is this really
the kind of business

05:33.366 --> 05:35.333
we want in this town?

05:35.368 --> 05:38.103
- You know, I have yet
to find an ornament in there

05:38.138 --> 05:39.471
that I'd put on my tree,

05:39.506 --> 05:43.141
and I heard those little elves
they have running around,

05:43.176 --> 05:45.543
they're actually underage kids.

05:45.578 --> 05:47.579
- Ladies, if we don't
approve this,

05:47.614 --> 05:49.581
then Christmas World
will take its fake snow,

05:49.616 --> 05:52.517
and its all-you-can-drink
nog fountain to Elmdale!

05:52.552 --> 05:54.486
- Well, that makes
our decision easy.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.121
- Oh, Moira!

05:56.156 --> 05:57.589
Moira, Moira, Moira.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.524
A word to the wise, okay?

05:59.559 --> 06:02.260
you don't vote against
Christmas.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.162
It's huge business.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.330
Tourist dollars!

06:05.365 --> 06:07.399
- Well, I'm not voting for it.

06:07.434 --> 06:10.135
- I'm inclined to side
with Veronica on this.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.136
- (Groans)

06:11.171 --> 06:12.971
- All right, look guys,
this is a big decision.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.372
Let's take a little time
to think about it.

06:14.407 --> 06:16.975
It's-it's Christmas World!

06:17.010 --> 06:18.610
We don't wanna get
on their naughty list.

06:18.645 --> 06:19.644
(Chuckles)

06:20.980 --> 06:23.615
(Laughs)

06:23.650 --> 06:24.683
(Birds chirp)

06:26.986 --> 06:28.987
Ivan: Oh.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.422
This is where I bake.

06:30.457 --> 06:31.556
I have three ovens.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.358
Is tradition in my family.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.127
We make vatritza, burek,
gibantsa...

06:36.162 --> 06:39.497
and now I making uh, Danish,
eclair,

06:39.532 --> 06:42.467
American-style toaster
popping tart.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.669
- Wow, that sounds great, Ivan,

06:44.704 --> 06:46.704
but I was thinking...

06:46.739 --> 06:48.640
cinnamon buns.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.575
You know, the smell of cinnamon

06:50.610 --> 06:53.111
in the motel lobby, mmm!

06:53.146 --> 06:55.046
- Mr. Rose, for you,
I can make anything.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.714
- Great.
- Blueberry bun,

06:56.749 --> 06:57.749
butter tart,

06:57.784 --> 06:59.717
blueberry butter tart
with raisin,

06:59.752 --> 07:02.086
blueberry butter tart
with chips of chocolate--

07:02.121 --> 07:05.023
- Well, let's just stick
with cinnamon buns for now,

07:05.058 --> 07:06.391
and if this works,

07:06.426 --> 07:08.326
we'll take it from there.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.595
- And I'm giving you
special price.

07:10.630 --> 07:11.429
- Thank you.

07:11.464 --> 07:13.965
- Because you know Twyla.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.667
- Yes, I do.

07:15.702 --> 07:18.636
- I watch you make her laugh.

07:18.671 --> 07:21.172
- You watch me make her laugh?

07:21.207 --> 07:23.575
- Mhmm.
- Oh, so you...

07:23.610 --> 07:26.277
you like Twyla!

07:26.312 --> 07:29.080
Oh, well, you should uh...

07:29.115 --> 07:30.515
talk to her, I guess.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.083
- No, no, I can't.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.619
I try, but when I speak,

07:34.654 --> 07:37.455
is like many, many muffin
in my mouth.

07:37.490 --> 07:39.123
You talk for me?

07:39.158 --> 07:40.692
- Oh, no, no, no,

07:40.727 --> 07:43.127
I wouldn't be too comfortable
doing that, no.

07:43.162 --> 07:44.729
- You just say nice thing.

07:44.764 --> 07:46.397
I'll give you cinnamon bun
for free.

07:46.432 --> 07:48.099
You say, he's a good man,

07:48.134 --> 07:50.735
hard worker, never hurt no one.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.971
- Well, I wouldn't lead
with that but uh...

07:53.006 --> 07:55.640
no, no, I think this is better
coming from you.

07:57.176 --> 07:58.710
(Crickets chirp)

08:00.413 --> 08:02.313
(Knocking)

08:02.348 --> 08:03.214
- Hmm?

08:03.249 --> 08:05.416
- So, I have some news.

08:05.451 --> 08:07.385
- Oh David, I'm not sure
I'm in the mood

08:07.420 --> 08:10.288
to hear about another
sexual exploit.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.023
I'm sorry, who is it this time?

08:12.058 --> 08:15.226
- I have actually been thinking
about going back to work.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.562
- That's wonderful!

08:17.597 --> 08:19.097
You've received an offer?

08:19.132 --> 08:22.133
- Um, it's more of a plan
for an idea

08:22.168 --> 08:24.970
of a-a thing that I will
be working at.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.106
- Well, that sounds
less concrete,

08:28.141 --> 08:30.475
but full of promise, I'm sure.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.478
I know you've been moping about
the motel for some time now.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.713
- Mm, decompressing.

08:35.748 --> 08:38.182
Um, and from that decompression

08:38.217 --> 08:42.020
came the idea to start
my own business.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.521
- Hmm!

08:43.556 --> 08:47.091
And just what is this
exciting new venture?

08:47.126 --> 08:50.094
- I plan to submit
a lease application

08:50.129 --> 08:52.063
for the general store.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.434
- Ha! Oh! Can you imagine?

08:59.238 --> 09:01.472
...Not seizing on this
opportunity.

09:01.507 --> 09:03.341
- Well, I'll be investing
some of the money

09:03.376 --> 09:05.009
I got from the Blouse Barn.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.112
- Mhmm, a bold decision.

09:08.147 --> 09:11.449
Especially since the previous
business has since gone under.

09:11.484 --> 09:12.684
Dare I say,

09:12.719 --> 09:15.119
the space might be cursed?

09:15.154 --> 09:18.489
- Okay, the general store
was a disaster.

09:18.524 --> 09:20.992
- And your plan is to raise
it from the ashes?

09:21.027 --> 09:24.095
Well, that's a risky move
on the part of your investors.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.030
- I don't have any investors.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.333
It's just me.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.034
- Just you?

09:30.069 --> 09:33.638
- I am doing this
all on my own.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.473
- All on your own?

09:35.508 --> 09:37.976
- Yeah, I've actually given it
a lot of thought.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.944
- You have?

09:39.979 --> 09:42.347
- You're the that's been
telling me to get back to work!

09:42.382 --> 09:44.048
- I did?
- Oh my God!

09:44.083 --> 09:46.184
- What, I'm simply
asking questions!

09:46.219 --> 09:48.553
- No, you're not, you're just
repeating random things

09:48.588 --> 09:49.687
that I've been saying!

09:49.722 --> 09:52.156
- Oh, far be it from me
to stand in your way

09:52.191 --> 09:55.660
while you roll the dice
with your hard-earned savings!

09:57.163 --> 09:58.596
- Thank you!

09:58.631 --> 10:00.065
That's all you had to say.

10:07.006 --> 10:09.707
Ronnie: Who wants
a silver tree?

10:09.742 --> 10:12.176
The only people who buy silver
trees are serial killers,

10:12.211 --> 10:13.778
and single men over 40,

10:13.813 --> 10:16.147
and my cousin, who is a single
man over 40.

10:17.950 --> 10:21.152
- Oh, what a startling
little tannenbaum.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.854
To whom do we owe
our reciprocity

10:22.889 --> 10:24.756
for this yuletide gift?

10:24.791 --> 10:27.992
- It says Christmas World
right on it.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.927
- Oh, I see!

10:29.962 --> 10:31.696
Sometimes the eyes
won't allow the brain

10:31.731 --> 10:33.665
to see things at first.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.701
Like the cultural
and economic benefits...

10:36.736 --> 10:40.071
of a seasonally specific store.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.573
- Okay, what did they send you?

10:42.608 --> 10:44.909
- Nothing, I assure you.

10:44.944 --> 10:47.612
But when one considers
the alternatives...

10:47.647 --> 10:50.181
- Moira, are you caving
on this?

10:50.216 --> 10:52.183
- I'm just thinking out loud.

10:52.218 --> 10:54.486
What if a young, independent

10:55.588 --> 10:57.789
business person
were to step in?

10:58.858 --> 11:01.793
I worry, one worries,

11:01.828 --> 11:04.062
you worry, are they too naive,

11:04.097 --> 11:05.596
or overly coddled,

11:05.631 --> 11:07.732
or emotionally precious

11:07.767 --> 11:10.768
to handle the rigor
of establishing a business?

11:10.803 --> 11:12.170
- Look, I uh...

11:13.740 --> 11:15.606
I don't wanna pressure anyone,

11:15.641 --> 11:16.841
but uh...

11:16.876 --> 11:19.711
Gwen did tell me if I uh,

11:19.746 --> 11:22.046
I don't get Christmas World
passed,

11:22.081 --> 11:23.848
I shouldn't come home.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.650
(Laughs)

11:25.685 --> 11:28.853
I shouldn't...
I shouldn't come home.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.556
- Okay, let's put it to a vote.

11:31.591 --> 11:34.192
Shall we?

11:34.227 --> 11:36.895
All those in favor
of Christmas World?

11:40.666 --> 11:42.600
- Hah! Done!

11:42.635 --> 11:43.835
Thank you, Moira!

11:43.870 --> 11:45.470
(Phone rings)

11:47.173 --> 11:48.773
- It's Gwen.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.708
The woman has a sixth sense.

11:50.743 --> 11:53.010
Hi honey, are you sitting down?

11:53.045 --> 11:55.113
- Trust me, it's for the best.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.782
- It's happening!
(Laughs)

11:57.817 --> 11:59.917
It's really happening!

11:59.952 --> 12:02.420
Jocelyn: So here's the thing
about Marie Antoinette.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.889
Even though I love to eat cake,

12:04.924 --> 12:07.191
I think I'd be pretty annoyed
with her myself.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.826
I see your hand up Alexis,

12:08.861 --> 12:10.795
it's just that you probably
haven't had a chance

12:10.830 --> 12:12.196
to catch up.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.332
- Okay, it's just that
she never actually said

12:14.367 --> 12:15.600
"let them eat cake."

12:15.635 --> 12:18.469
- Um well, that depends
on who you ask.

12:18.504 --> 12:19.804
- Hmm, well,
I asked Kirsten Dunst,

12:19.839 --> 12:21.739
who played her in the movie.

12:21.774 --> 12:24.475
Um, that line was actually
written years before

12:24.510 --> 12:26.677
Marie Antoinette allegedly
said it.

12:26.712 --> 12:28.813
And um, Kirsten also told me
at the premiere

12:28.848 --> 12:30.581
that she was jealous
of my bangs.

12:30.616 --> 12:32.283
- Thank you for that
contribution

12:32.318 --> 12:33.484
to the discussion, now--

12:33.519 --> 12:35.453
- My friends used
to call me Marie,

12:35.488 --> 12:37.355
And that was mainly
because I was casually

12:37.390 --> 12:39.490
seeing Prince Harry,
so there was the whole like,

12:39.525 --> 12:41.392
is she gonna be a princess
thing,

12:41.427 --> 12:43.294
um, but it's also because
we were going through

12:43.329 --> 12:45.830
this very dark phase
where we were just like,

12:45.865 --> 12:47.665
partying too hard.

12:47.700 --> 12:48.833
Jocelyn: Thank you for your
enthusiasm,

12:48.868 --> 12:51.636
it's just that we have a lot
to cover here.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.337
Girls?

12:53.372 --> 12:56.174
What did I say about
passing notes in class?

12:56.209 --> 12:58.309
I'll see you both after school.

12:58.344 --> 12:59.644
You know who else passed notes?

12:59.679 --> 13:02.514
This lady passed a lot
of secret notes,

13:03.649 --> 13:06.484
and eventually was killed.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.721
- Oh hi, how are you?

13:10.756 --> 13:13.558
- Very busy.
- How am I?! Terrific!

13:13.593 --> 13:16.060
Aside from the fact
that I caught wind

13:16.095 --> 13:20.498
that Christmas World was moving
into the general store.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.767
Just when I thought that
the taste levels in this town

13:22.802 --> 13:25.403
were already scraping
the bottom of the barrel.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.071
- Oh! Tell me about it.

13:27.106 --> 13:28.272
- Hmm...

13:28.307 --> 13:30.341
- So you can imagine
my surprise when I found out

13:30.376 --> 13:32.410
that the deciding factor
in all of this

13:32.445 --> 13:34.478
was my own mother!

13:34.513 --> 13:36.147
It seems extremely off brand

13:36.182 --> 13:39.750
to support a disgusting
big box store like that.

13:39.785 --> 13:41.652
- (Sighs)

13:41.687 --> 13:43.555
- David, sit, please.

13:49.128 --> 13:50.728
I know you think what
I did was cruel,

13:50.763 --> 13:53.598
but I was just protecting you.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.366
And I'd say you'll understand
one day,

13:55.401 --> 13:57.168
but you don't enjoy children,

13:57.203 --> 13:58.870
so perhaps you won't.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.671
- Okay, protect me from what?

14:00.706 --> 14:02.506
- From yourself.

14:02.541 --> 14:04.075
Your father and I have not
prepared you

14:04.110 --> 14:06.143
for an undertaking
of this scope!

14:06.178 --> 14:07.778
- Okay, what about
all the galleries?

14:07.813 --> 14:08.746
Those were all me.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.716
I've run businesses before.

14:11.751 --> 14:14.719
- Never on your own,
and never without a safety net.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.787
- I don't know how many times
I have to thank you

14:16.822 --> 14:18.356
for the start-up money!

14:18.391 --> 14:21.626
But I opened those
galleries myself.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.161
- And who do you think
bought all that art,

14:24.196 --> 14:26.564
and sold out all your shows?

14:26.599 --> 14:28.199
- Uh, my patrons.

14:34.106 --> 14:38.543
- And who do you think
bought all your patrons?

14:41.414 --> 14:42.080
- (Gasps)

14:47.720 --> 14:51.289
- So you're telling me that
my entire professional career

14:51.324 --> 14:52.290
was a sham?!

14:52.325 --> 14:54.725
- We helped you
because we could!

14:54.760 --> 14:57.161
And now I realize that
might not have been

14:57.196 --> 14:59.130
the best thing for you
or your autonomy, but--

14:59.165 --> 15:01.032
- Okay, well, now I guess
I'll never find out

15:01.067 --> 15:03.467
if I could've succeeded
on my own.

15:03.502 --> 15:05.736
- David!

15:05.771 --> 15:07.038
(Door bang shut)

15:10.142 --> 15:10.675
(Slams)

15:14.647 --> 15:16.347
(Bell on door jingles)

15:17.483 --> 15:19.417
Ivan: Hello, Mr. Rose.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.052
Cinnamon buns for you.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.787
- Oh Ivan, thank you.

15:24.223 --> 15:26.157
Ohh! These smell amazing!

15:27.226 --> 15:29.093
- And I have muffins for Twyla.

15:29.128 --> 15:31.295
- Oh.
- Yeah, I'm going to talk
to her now.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.097
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.465
(Chuckles)

15:37.169 --> 15:39.403
- Hi, Ivan.
- Um...

15:39.438 --> 15:41.605
Here's the muffins.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.275
Goodbye.
- Yeah.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.644
- Wow!

15:46.679 --> 15:48.446
- Mr. Rose, I blow it.

15:49.715 --> 15:52.350
- Oh, well, there's always
tomorrow, Ivan.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.251
No, no, don't--
all right, have a seat.

15:54.286 --> 15:57.154
- I always watch
romantic movies.

15:57.189 --> 15:58.456
"Got Mail,"

15:58.491 --> 16:00.591
"When Harry Met Sally,"

16:00.626 --> 16:02.093
"Smell of Woman."

16:02.128 --> 16:05.262
- Yeah, Ivan, you don't want
to be over-preparing.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.598
- Oh.
- Hey, guys.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.301
What can I get you?
- I'm good man.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.137
- Okay, and?

16:13.172 --> 16:14.538
- I'll have the waffles.

16:14.573 --> 16:16.574
- And uh, eggs,

16:16.609 --> 16:18.776
uh, uh,

16:18.811 --> 16:22.013
what does dog say
before the breakfast?

16:23.649 --> 16:26.417
Bun appetite.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.719
Bun appetite.

16:28.754 --> 16:31.322
Bun...

16:31.357 --> 16:35.092
Bone appetit, I think
it's a dog bone joke.

16:35.127 --> 16:37.595
Bun appetite.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.131
Eggs and waffles.
- Hmm, yes.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.200
- Coming up.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.469
- Yeah.
- I know.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.172
- Oh, well...

16:48.207 --> 16:52.076
I think uh a little quality
control on this

16:52.111 --> 16:55.246
wouldn't hurt, huh?
- Yeah, yes.

16:55.281 --> 16:56.214
(Bell rings)

17:00.286 --> 17:03.687
- Hey, I think that we started
out on the wrong foot.

17:03.722 --> 17:06.157
And like, I totally get it,
there's a new girl in town,

17:06.192 --> 17:08.259
and that can be super
intimidating,

17:08.294 --> 17:09.326
but I just wanted
to let you know

17:09.361 --> 17:12.530
that I'm actually
very approachable.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.432
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.734
- So why don't you just show me
what that note says.

17:21.140 --> 17:25.676
- Girls, passing notes in class
is not only disruptive

17:25.711 --> 17:29.080
to the whole student body--
- I started it.

17:29.115 --> 17:33.050
I passed the note to Steph M.
and Becky.

17:33.085 --> 17:35.086
- Alexis, if you're gonna be
in this class,

17:35.121 --> 17:38.389
you are gonna have to learn
to be less disruptive.

17:38.424 --> 17:40.491
Now let's see what
was so important.

17:40.526 --> 17:43.194
- That really isn't necessary,
Mrs. Schitt.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.196
"Alexis is too pretty,

17:47.199 --> 17:49.834
and everyone's talking
about the dress.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.502
So gorge."

17:55.441 --> 17:58.242
Okay, I love that
you're so confident,

17:58.277 --> 17:59.510
- Mhmm.

17:59.545 --> 18:00.744
- It's just that we're going
to have to focus

18:00.779 --> 18:02.646
a little less on ourselves,

18:02.681 --> 18:05.382
and a little more
on the material.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.018
- Totally.
- Okay.

18:09.788 --> 18:12.323
- I stole this dress
from Ashlee Simpson.

18:12.358 --> 18:15.493
Or like, she stole it from me,
and then I stole it back.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.162
- Do you wanna have lunch
tomorrow?

18:19.265 --> 18:20.264
- Sure.

18:25.404 --> 18:28.038
- I just find it extremely
violating.

18:28.073 --> 18:30.241
- Because your parents
threw money at you?

18:30.276 --> 18:31.442
- Yes!

18:31.477 --> 18:32.576
They paid for everything,

18:32.611 --> 18:35.679
it's like a form
of child abuse.

18:35.714 --> 18:37.081
- Don't quote me on this,

18:37.116 --> 18:41.118
but it seems like their
intentions were good.

18:41.153 --> 18:43.287
I mean, they didn't buy
all the good reviews

18:43.322 --> 18:44.655
your galleries got.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.223
- Who's to say?!

18:46.258 --> 18:49.527
- Yeah, I mean, they do give me
a small weekly stipend

18:49.562 --> 18:51.228
for to hanging out
with you, so...

18:51.263 --> 18:53.797
- Ugh!

18:53.832 --> 18:55.299
- David, there you are.

18:55.334 --> 18:56.800
I come bearing good news.

18:56.835 --> 18:59.103
- And what's that, your friends
at Christmas World

18:59.138 --> 19:01.038
are looking for
a deeply embittered,

19:01.073 --> 19:03.174
mildly Hebraic-looking elf?!

19:03.209 --> 19:04.341
- I thought you might
like to know

19:04.376 --> 19:08.112
that council has agreed
to accept your application.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.616
- What about Christmas World?

19:12.651 --> 19:14.652
- I had a very
effective strategy

19:14.687 --> 19:16.687
to change everyone's minds,

19:16.722 --> 19:18.189
that I ultimately didn't
get to use,

19:18.224 --> 19:20.758
because Christmas World
pulled out.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.493
- This is good news!

19:23.829 --> 19:27.398
- I mean, yeah, if someone
hadn't snuffed out

19:27.433 --> 19:30.167
the last remaining embers
of my self-confidence.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.603
- Why don't you channel some
of that charming self-pity

19:32.638 --> 19:35.272
into a business plan, okay?

19:35.307 --> 19:36.407
Because the lease is yours,
David,

19:36.442 --> 19:38.109
if you still want it.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.146
- Which he does.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.147
- If there's anyone
in this town

19:43.182 --> 19:44.081
who might have the eye

19:44.116 --> 19:46.750
to create something truly
beautiful,

19:46.785 --> 19:48.052
it's you, David.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.222
And me, but in this case, you.

19:53.592 --> 19:55.092
- (Sighs) Okay.

19:56.262 --> 19:58.696
I will submit my application.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.365
(Crickets chirp)

20:02.601 --> 20:04.869
- There's cinnamon buns
in the lobby!

20:06.338 --> 20:07.304
These are good.

20:07.339 --> 20:08.305
- I know, where are these from?

20:08.340 --> 20:10.341
- Yeah, I got those
for the motel.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.942
They're supposed to be
for the guests!

20:11.977 --> 20:13.477
- Okay, well, they were
just sitting there.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.479
- Oh, they weren't just
sitting there, Alexis,

20:15.514 --> 20:17.948
they're the product of a lot
of hard work!

20:17.983 --> 20:18.949
Moira: John?

20:18.984 --> 20:20.985
- In here, Moira.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.653
- There are cinnamon buns
in the lobby!

20:22.688 --> 20:24.755
- Oh come on, Moira, Moira!

20:24.790 --> 20:27.992
These are for the continental
breakfast we're offering

20:28.027 --> 20:29.426
at the motel!

20:29.461 --> 20:30.728
- Continental breakfast?

20:30.763 --> 20:32.997
- They're for the guests!
- How whimsical.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.798
- It's a start, it's a start,

20:34.833 --> 20:36.033
it's a big step.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.369
- What exactly goes into
a "continental breakfast?"

20:38.404 --> 20:40.004
- It's a breakfast, David,

20:40.039 --> 20:42.906
it's a light breakfast
with pastries and coffee.

20:42.941 --> 20:44.675
- What's continental
about that?

20:44.710 --> 20:46.277
- It's for business travelers,

20:46.312 --> 20:48.012
travelling the continent,

20:48.047 --> 20:50.781
eating breakfast, and...

20:50.816 --> 20:52.449
continental travelling.

20:52.484 --> 20:54.418
- That doesn't sound
even remotely correct.

20:54.453 --> 20:55.886
- Well, it's European, Moira.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.389
So-okay, come on, seriously!

20:58.424 --> 20:59.590
There's only one left?!

20:59.625 --> 21:01.692
- I know, Stevie was eating
the other one.

21:01.727 --> 21:02.760
- Here, why don't you
have this,

21:02.795 --> 21:03.694
and I'll take the big one.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.629
- It's all right,
I'll take care of it.

21:05.664 --> 21:08.899
Well, I guess it would be wrong
to serve the guests day-olds.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.702
You know this bun added
a star to our rating?

21:11.737 --> 21:12.970
- How many did we have before?

21:13.005 --> 21:14.205
- Not the point!
