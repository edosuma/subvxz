WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.168
Previously on Rosewood...

00:02.252 --> 00:03.920
Your husband died, didn't he?
What happened to him?

00:04.004 --> 00:06.464
Pizza, movie, bed,
that was our Sunday routine.

00:06.548 --> 00:09.467
Next morning he kissed me goodbye
and collapsed.

00:10.010 --> 00:10.927
Villa, I have
to tell you something.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.346
I don't think Eddie died
of natural causes.

00:13.596 --> 00:15.557
You think I'd miss
my own husband's murder?

00:15.640 --> 00:17.767
Rosie, I'm sorry.
You were right about everything.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.853
Eddie isn't who I thought he was.

00:19.936 --> 00:22.939
All evidence points to him
being involved in something criminal.

00:23.023 --> 00:26.776
Sometimes you have to ignore
what the evidence says,

00:26.860 --> 00:27.861
and trust your gut.

00:27.944 --> 00:31.114
What you and Eddie had was special.
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

00:31.322 --> 00:33.575
- I'm really ready to do this.
- Glad to hear you say that.

00:33.658 --> 00:35.910
I just put in a request
to have Eddie's body exhumed.

00:48.048 --> 00:52.427
Vibrations of tremors
That shook long ago

00:57.140 --> 01:02.103
Tear holes in the fabric
Of all that we know

01:08.359 --> 01:10.111
Sorry, I got stuck
in a little traffic.

01:13.531 --> 01:15.533
I'll give you as much time here
as you need with him.

01:15.617 --> 01:16.993
I don't think I can do this.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.037
I don't wanna see him.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.081
Not this way.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.667
Wait upstairs.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.462
I'll call you when I'm done.

01:31.216 --> 01:34.677
8:35 AM, October 6, 2016.

01:34.928 --> 01:39.682
Beginning the autopsy on the
exhumed body of Edward Horatio Lunez.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.105
Okay, so, this is
one of those situations

01:45.188 --> 01:47.273
they don't teach you about
in forensics school.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.859
We'll do the same thing we always do.

01:50.985 --> 01:52.445
We'll give it our all.

01:54.656 --> 02:00.495
If you're thinking of letting me go
Then it's time that you do

02:03.665 --> 02:09.129
If you're thinking of letting me go
Then it's time that you do

02:15.718 --> 02:17.762
What? Talk. Did you find something?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.139
It's what I didn't find.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.057
His liver, it's missing.

02:21.516 --> 02:24.227
Question is, is it missing
accidentally or on purpose?

02:24.310 --> 02:25.311
So, what do we do?

02:25.395 --> 02:27.063
Call New York,
hammer the doc for info?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.482
No, not an option. He's dead.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.402
Suspected suicide about a week ago.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.736
Coincidence?

02:34.571 --> 02:35.947
We need to get on a plane.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.577
Cap, this for real,
or are you yanking my chain here?

02:40.660 --> 02:42.495
I don't yank other men's chains, Ira.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.955
You want on a case with me or not?

02:44.038 --> 02:46.457
I do. I'm just wondering what
are we doing in a fashion mall.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.294
Well, I got a tip about a girl
who might have some pertinent info.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.212
But, hey, man, if this all goes well
while we're here,

02:51.296 --> 02:53.590
maybe Daddy buys you some new duds
that don't shout "cop."

02:53.673 --> 02:56.050
So let me get this straight.
We're looking for a prostitute?

02:56.134 --> 02:58.136
Not just a prostitute, Ira,
a ring of prostitutes.

02:58.219 --> 02:59.721
-A ring?
-A ring.

02:59.804 --> 03:02.098
Catering to the uber-rich
in our fair city.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.267
Since when are a couple of hookers
top priority

03:04.350 --> 03:05.977
for the new captain of the department?

03:09.606 --> 03:11.983
-Can I help you two with something?
-Yes, you can.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.402
I'm looking for a scent.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.779
You mind taking me in?

03:16.863 --> 03:19.324
Tell me what you think works
with my natural pheromones.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.742
-Really?
-Mmm.

03:22.285 --> 03:26.873
I'd say something manly, woodsy,
maybe with a hint of flannel?

03:27.832 --> 03:29.751
- Well, you are good.
- Yeah.

03:29.876 --> 03:30.960
What about my buddy here?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.337
What do you think?
Something cupcake-y?

03:32.420 --> 03:33.671
I don't know. Give him a smell.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.215
Look, I'm okay not being smelled.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.342
Look, we don't have a lot of time,
so I'm not interested

03:37.425 --> 03:39.928
in the little wink-and-smile game
you're playing.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.721
A birdie told me
maybe you and your friends

03:41.804 --> 03:43.848
know of a little
money-for-the-honey arrangement?

03:44.557 --> 03:46.184
I don't know what that is.

03:46.517 --> 03:47.435
Cash-for-flash?

03:47.518 --> 03:50.146
You pay me,
I make Johnny Businessman very happy?

03:50.230 --> 03:52.190
Would you rather
hand out flannel samples

03:52.273 --> 03:54.067
to everybody
at the booking department?

03:54.192 --> 03:55.276
Start talking.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.154
-Is he serious?
-I believe so.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.657
Sweetie, what do you think
we do for a living? We're cops.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.243
I'm the captain.
He used to be the captain.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.161
Yeah, that makes total sense on him.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.246
Yeah.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.123
But you, I thought you were a model.

04:09.457 --> 04:10.291
Wow.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.086
I may or may not have posed
for a department calendar in the past.

04:13.169 --> 04:14.170
Enough.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.506
Look, a sweet girl like you
doesn't need

04:16.589 --> 04:18.591
a sex-worker charge
on her record, okay?

04:18.675 --> 04:20.718
So you steer us
in the right direction,

04:21.302 --> 04:22.679
maybe we forget your name.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.057
I went once with a friend,

04:26.140 --> 04:28.142
and all I did was talk to some guys.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.813
The Herschel Club in Brickell.

04:31.896 --> 04:32.897
Thanks for that.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.565
Thank you for that cologne tip.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.944
-Do flannel. Got it.
-Yeah. Anytime.

04:40.446 --> 04:41.698
Nice work, Ira.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.242
I mean, your style's a little
rough-and-tumble, but I like it.

04:44.325 --> 04:45.743
-I get it done.
-Yeah, you do.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.121
Looks like you and I have a date
tonight at the Herschel Club.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.956
All due respect,
I want to be polite, okay,

04:50.039 --> 04:51.332
mind our ranks and such,

04:51.416 --> 04:53.584
but I think you got it
covered from here, right?

04:53.668 --> 04:55.962
All due respect, you're coming.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.008
Yeah!

05:08.683 --> 05:09.726
Oh, man.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.853
You're gonna look so good
in a snorkel mask.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.855
I won't be able to resist.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.899
I told you I am not going
scuba diving, okay?

05:16.983 --> 05:21.112
I'll look at fish on my plate.
Next to some mango salsa.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.824
But I want to make it through
this honeymoon alive, okay?

05:26.826 --> 05:27.910
Okay, Lissie.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.330
Will you at least wear the mask
for me in the bedroom?

05:30.955 --> 05:32.498
-Come on.
-Are you crazy?

05:33.333 --> 05:36.336
The new Mr. and Mrs. Lunez.
Can I get either of you something?

05:37.962 --> 05:41.716
Actually, you wouldn't happen to have
a snorkel mask back there, would you?

05:46.262 --> 05:47.263
You okay?

05:50.391 --> 05:52.101
Eddie? Eddie?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.606
Help! Help!

05:56.689 --> 05:58.608
Somebody help! He's choking!

05:58.941 --> 06:00.234
Help! Please!

06:00.651 --> 06:02.528
Please! Help!

06:02.612 --> 06:04.322
Somebody, help! He's choking!

06:04.405 --> 06:06.324
Dear? Are you okay?

06:08.826 --> 06:10.119
Do you get jittery
while you're flying?

06:10.203 --> 06:11.746
I'm fine. I'm...

06:11.829 --> 06:13.456
I just... I'm fine.

06:17.835 --> 06:19.379
So, you couldn't wait up, huh?

06:19.462 --> 06:21.047
I guess you didn't realize that

06:21.172 --> 06:22.715
guys with multiple
open-heart surgeries

06:22.799 --> 06:23.841
can't go through the x-rays.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.885
That TSA agent got a little handsy.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.137
Rosie, thank you for doing this.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.641
-I know your plate is--
-Empty. For you.

06:32.809 --> 06:33.851
We got this.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.230
Figure out what those pictures were
from Eddie's camera?

06:37.313 --> 06:39.232
No, but I think we're gonna find out.

06:54.664 --> 06:55.790
Hey, you okay?

06:55.873 --> 06:57.542
I'm cake. I'm worried about you.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.919
-Me?
-Yeah, this is my old stomping ground.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.463
I'm not sure if you're cut out
for the mean streets of New York City.

07:02.755 --> 07:03.923
Come on. I can be plenty mean.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.007
Is that right?

07:05.091 --> 07:07.510
Oh, that is right.

07:07.718 --> 07:09.470
-What are you doing?
-It's my mean face.

07:09.637 --> 07:12.140
-That face says "mug me."
-You don't know.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.976
Seriously, hang on to those pocket
squares. Someone's gonna mug you.

07:15.059 --> 07:16.936
And keep up.
We walk faster here in New York.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.355
So, do you know this
Captain Murillo we're meeting with?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.649
He wasn't here when I was, but
I wouldn't be looking for any hugs.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.359
Villa, I don't just
hug everybody, okay?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.694
You should know that.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.655
-Captain Murillo.
-Yeah. Okay.

07:27.738 --> 07:28.823
-Yeah.
-All right.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.700
So, how can I help you two?

07:30.783 --> 07:31.868
I'm Dr. Beaumont Rosewood.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.662
I'm a pathologist in Miami,
and this is Detective Villa.

07:34.745 --> 07:37.498
-She actually used to work--
-Yeah, in the 118. I know your name.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.375
We're a little concerned
about the timing

07:39.459 --> 07:42.044
of the suicide of your ME,
Dr. Jamal.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.631
I don't have to tell you
the stress on an ME

07:45.715 --> 07:46.716
in New York City.

07:46.966 --> 07:47.884
This ain't Miami.

07:47.967 --> 07:51.387
But we believe his death is connected
to an investigation we're working.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.805
And what investigation is that?

07:52.889 --> 07:55.349
My former husband, Eddie Lunez.

07:56.058 --> 07:58.603
I have sympathy for you, Detective,
and for your loss,

07:58.686 --> 08:00.980
but as far
as the death of your husband,

08:01.063 --> 08:04.150
it wasn't a murder,
and it wasn't an investigation here.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.234
Well, we believe that--

08:05.318 --> 08:08.279
Beliefs and seven bucks will get you
a cup of coffee in this town.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.700
Normally, I'd have an officer
escort you back to the airport,

08:12.783 --> 08:15.077
but you're one of us.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.329
You're blue.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.749
So I'm gonna suggest
you two get a slice,

08:20.833 --> 08:22.210
then jump back on a plane.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.839
-So, we cabbing back to the airport?
-Hell no.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.508
That's exactly what
I was hoping you were gonna say.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.259
You know, the guy had a bad attitude
and a dead ME.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.636
That's more than enough
reason to double down.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.095
That's what I was hoping
you were gonna say.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.848
-Where do we start?
-Eddie. We start turning over stones.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.351
Yeah, I think it's time I got
to know who he really was.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.435
Hey!

08:58.955 --> 09:02.542
Listen, your husband, Eddie,
he was an incredible person.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.502
Thanks. That's sweet.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.504
But I don't need to hear the
"Teacher of the Year" speech.

09:06.587 --> 09:09.340
I want the other stuff.
The Eddie juice, the real story.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.133
-Viilla, this isn't an interrogation.
-Maybe it should be.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.635
Or maybe it shouldn't be.
I think the principal is just--

09:12.718 --> 09:14.303
Lying? Yeah.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.763
See, thing is, I did my homework.

09:15.846 --> 09:18.849
There was a three-week period,
February 2014...

09:18.933 --> 09:21.352
Eddie was making deposits,
but they weren't from this school.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.479
They weren't from you.
Why weren't you paying him?

09:23.563 --> 09:26.482
I don't think I like the implications
or the tone.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.818
Oh, no? Not a fan? Ouch.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.444
Well, then you're
gonna hate this part.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.906
I don't know what this is,
but I can call security right now.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.157
Really?

09:35.241 --> 09:38.911
The little private-school guys
with the blue short-sleeved shirts?

09:38.995 --> 09:40.663
Go ahead. Call them.
Call them right now.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.373
-They're not gonna do anything.
-No, no.

09:42.456 --> 09:43.624
-Let's see them. I have all day.
-I don't think...

09:43.708 --> 09:46.335
No, no, I don't think we need
to call the blue short-sleeved guys.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.587
Not today. We're good.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.047
Look, he got into a fight.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.508
He lost it on another member
of the faculty.

09:53.175 --> 09:54.635
Eddie? With who?

09:55.803 --> 09:57.930
With me. Fist to my jaw.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.348
Fastest hook I never saw.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.601
-Why would he do that?
-Who knows? Who cares?

10:02.435 --> 10:04.103
It was about a kid, a student.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.605
Oliver Jacott.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.398
He was being picked on,

10:07.481 --> 10:10.109
and Eddie was mad
that I couldn't do more about it.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.694
Board wanted me to fire him.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.196
I did him a favor
and swept it under the rug,

10:14.280 --> 10:16.782
but I had to suspend him
for three weeks without pay.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.826
Maybe you should have
done more to help the kid.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.453
Boys can be cruel.

10:20.536 --> 10:21.912
Survival of the fittest.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.205
Right, doctor?

10:24.582 --> 10:25.583
Me?

10:26.417 --> 10:28.878
I spent most of my freshman year
in a hospital bed.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.504
Almost didn't survive.

10:30.588 --> 10:31.756
I'm here now, though.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.716
We need to talk to that kid.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.845
Oliver Jacott?

10:38.262 --> 10:39.513
Mrs. Lunez.

10:39.597 --> 10:40.681
I'm sorry?

10:40.765 --> 10:42.141
Mr. Lunez was my teacher.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.310
He had a photo of you
he would keep on his desk.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.646
He was more than just a teacher to me.

10:46.729 --> 10:47.980
You mean like a big brother?

10:48.064 --> 10:49.148
More like a dad.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.692
More like a dad.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.363
How amazing would it be to have
a little Lunez running around here?

10:55.446 --> 10:57.948
Your stubbornness, my hair.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.285
Don't you want that, too?

11:01.369 --> 11:03.162
Of course I want that.

11:03.245 --> 11:06.248
I don't know if it's obvious,
but I don't really fit in here,

11:06.832 --> 11:07.958
and he defended me.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.460
You mean against Principal Garrity?

11:09.543 --> 11:10.920
I saw the whole throwdown.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.673
Then after, I wasn't allowed
to talk to Mr. Lunez anymore.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.549
Oliver!

11:15.633 --> 11:16.884
That's my dad.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.099
So, Principal Garrity...

11:23.182 --> 11:24.684
Should we crack open his world,
see what runs out?

11:24.767 --> 11:25.810
Not yet.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.645
I want to keep digging first,

11:27.978 --> 11:30.106
and I just thought of
another stone I have to turn.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.234
-Let's turn and burn.
-No. I got to do this one myself.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.985
It's personal.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.907
Anthony. Thanks for coming.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.243
Yeah, of course. So good to see you.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.661
What are you doing in New York?

11:44.412 --> 11:46.497
Just had a couple of days off.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.541
I love to feed the ducks.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.292
Ducks, huh?

11:53.170 --> 11:55.965
-Listen, I should have been more--
-Hey, hey, I get it.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.884
You were his best friend, not mine.

11:59.802 --> 12:00.803
You know what? Screw it.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.680
I'm not great
at the touchy-feely small talk.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.140
Eddie lied to me.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.059
And so did you.
There was no car accident.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.269
You covered for him.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.645
So what really happened?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.564
-Annalise, I don't know--
-This goes one of two ways.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.065
You can start being honest with me,

12:13.149 --> 12:16.235
and this can be a nice reunion
with two old friends

12:16.318 --> 12:17.319
on a park bench,

12:17.403 --> 12:20.114
or you know me,
and you know I don't dick around.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.574
So...

12:22.241 --> 12:23.701
What do you need to know?

12:24.326 --> 12:26.120
Eddie didn't die from an embolism.

12:26.871 --> 12:27.997
He was murdered.

12:30.791 --> 12:34.086
Listen, I never wanted
to lie for him, okay?

12:34.170 --> 12:35.588
I don't know what was going on.

12:35.671 --> 12:38.299
I just know that he was really afraid
and really scared.

12:38.382 --> 12:39.675
-Of what?
-I don't know.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.886
He kept saying something about a Rico.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.138
-Rico who?
-I don't know, Annalise.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.306
I don't.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.808
The car, what happened to it?

12:47.892 --> 12:50.102
I still got it. Figured it was the

12:50.519 --> 12:52.313
last piece of him
I could hang on to, so...

13:03.532 --> 13:05.117
I've never seen any of this stuff.

13:05.659 --> 13:06.827
BREATHY FRESH

13:11.207 --> 13:12.541
I'm gonna take these with me.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.918
Eddie's old mints?

13:14.710 --> 13:15.795
Have at it.

13:22.092 --> 13:23.594
Serial numbers are filed off.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.805
Eddie had a gun?

13:31.602 --> 13:34.021
Tee,
I need to get eyes on that body again.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.648
And I need you
to do some tests for me.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.025
Rosie, are you kidding me?
I'm all alone here.

13:38.108 --> 13:39.652
Mitchie's in Pensacola,
doing something

13:39.735 --> 13:43.030
most likely illegal
and for sure super-weird.

13:43.113 --> 13:44.907
So, no, I can't...
I can't do it by myself.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.617
This isn't a request.
This isn't a favor.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.077
This is... just what it is.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.161
I'll be there every step.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.788
So put your big-girl pants on,
get started,

13:50.871 --> 13:51.956
and call me in an hour.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.450
Yes! That's it! That's totally it!

14:28.534 --> 14:29.994
Tara? Hold on.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.954
Tara? What?

14:32.037 --> 14:33.455
What's... What's going on?

14:36.292 --> 14:37.877
Pipp, I need your help.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.302
You know,
I tried to follow up on the name Rico

14:46.385 --> 14:48.971
that Eddie kept mentioning,
and talk about needles and haystacks,

14:49.054 --> 14:51.932
there are 32,000 Ricos
in the Manhattan area alone.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.643
I didn't want to say anything before,
but based on a metallic aroma

14:54.727 --> 14:56.645
from those mints
we got from Eddie's car,

14:56.854 --> 14:57.980
I did a preliminary tox screen.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.482
Okay, how and where could
you have possibly done that?

15:00.566 --> 15:02.776
Come on, Villa.
Private pathologists always travel

15:02.860 --> 15:05.654
with a spare white dress shirt
and a chem-screen kit.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.157
Let's just say my hotel room
happened to have coffee filters,

15:08.240 --> 15:09.783
carbonated water, and a sewing needle.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.077
-Okay, so, what did you find?
-Well, they weren't mints.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.288
Whatever was in that tin
had properties

15:14.371 --> 15:15.706
similar to those found in steroids.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.042
Wait... Eddie was juicing?

15:19.543 --> 15:20.628
So, how'd you get us here?

15:20.711 --> 15:22.713
I knew every t-shirt
in Eddie's closet.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.673
This wasn't one of them.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.383
So I did some recon on the logo.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.719
He was here.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.480
Sweetheart, you mind bringing
us back a couple of 1942 Viniq?

15:39.563 --> 15:40.606
Sure.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.983
Oh, and maybe a friend
to join us, too.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.068
You got it.

15:44.151 --> 15:47.529
I don't want another drink.
I don't want a friend coming over.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.198
-You got it?
-Man,

15:49.406 --> 15:50.908
for a guy who's
been married four times,

15:50.991 --> 15:52.368
you seem pretty wound up.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.664
Look, when the girls come back,
just take yours wherever, all right?

15:56.747 --> 15:57.915
Do your thing.

15:58.415 --> 15:59.833
I see nothing.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.877
Hell, I'll even pay for it.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.588
What are we doing here?

16:04.672 --> 16:06.048
This ridiculous...

16:06.256 --> 16:07.549
You don't even care
about a couple of old guys

16:07.633 --> 16:09.051
getting their jollies.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.095
You're right. I don't.
Not even a little.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.472
I'm just trying
to get to know you, Ira.

16:13.555 --> 16:16.266
Getting to know me or getting
to know my weaknesses?

16:22.815 --> 16:25.567
Eddie always did his own thing,
running along the East River,

16:25.651 --> 16:29.071
occasionally going to the local YMCA
for a pickup basketball game,

16:29.154 --> 16:32.366
but I had no idea
he ever set foot inside this place.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.162
Hey, boss,
you remember a guy named Eddie Lunez?

16:37.246 --> 16:39.206
He used to come in here
around two years ago.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.541
Nope.

16:40.624 --> 16:41.792
Okay, let me try that again.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.586
I'm Detective Annalise Villa,
East Miami PD.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.005
Did you know Eddie Lunez?

16:46.463 --> 16:48.799
This ain't no place
for no cops or broads,

16:48.882 --> 16:50.467
especially ones without juri-diction

16:50.551 --> 16:52.261
to come around here
asking no questions.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.722
Is it a place for doctors
with disciplined right hooks?

16:55.180 --> 16:56.306
You know a Rico?

16:56.390 --> 16:57.766
Maybe he's a cat that works here.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.060
Bennie!
What the hell are you looking at?

17:00.144 --> 17:03.272
Since you can't box no more,
get busy with those spit buckets!

17:03.856 --> 17:05.566
And I got nothing else to say to you.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.193
How 'bout you, slick?

17:09.153 --> 17:10.404
You recognize him?

17:11.488 --> 17:14.116
Hey, bro, no disrespect...
Your girl fine,

17:14.616 --> 17:16.201
but I'm in the middle
of something here.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.246
So you can step back and watch,
get turned on.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.706
I'm cool with that.

17:20.914 --> 17:21.832
Otherwise...

17:23.667 --> 17:25.085
Listen.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.503
Hey. Hey.

17:27.004 --> 17:29.590
The guy in the picture... He's dead.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.761
So any help jogging your
memory would be appreciated.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.138
Please.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.932
Too bad. So sad.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.601
People die.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.396
She crazy!

17:44.480 --> 17:46.231
You got to protect yourself
at all times, right?

17:46.315 --> 17:48.525
Otherwise, you open yourself
up to all kinds of trouble.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.486
-I am not done here.
-No, you... You are done.

17:50.569 --> 17:51.904
Hey, that's right! Run away!

17:51.987 --> 17:54.907
That's probably what that dead guy did
to get away from your ass!

17:54.990 --> 17:57.326
Okay, okay, okay.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.536
Hey! My man, sorry about my friend.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.872
She meant no disrespect... Really.

18:01.955 --> 18:03.957
I apologize. Bring it in?

18:06.001 --> 18:07.586
That dead guy was
my partner's husband.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.880
He loved her. She loved him.
It's the kind of love that I'm sure

18:09.963 --> 18:11.423
you will never know in your days.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.510
I've opened up a lot of
bodies in my lifetime,

18:14.593 --> 18:16.303
and I've never taken pleasure from it.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.680
But if you somehow
ended up on my table,

18:19.014 --> 18:20.599
I think I might enjoy it.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.059
That supposed to scare me, huh?

18:22.142 --> 18:23.477
No, it's not supposed to scare you.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.896
I'm gonna knock your ass out
in front of all your friends.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.314
Just say when.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.569
Say when.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.996
Now we can go.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.337
Hey, guys. Can I give you directions?

18:50.420 --> 18:52.256
Recommendations
for a less douchey car?

18:52.339 --> 18:54.049
How about we give out
the recommendations?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.884
Stop looking into
what you're looking into.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.553
You mean, like,
half-price tickets to "Hamilton"?

18:57.636 --> 18:58.971
-Any leads on that?
-Come on, Doc.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.973
You and the pretty detective
have done enough damage.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.683
We haven't even been
formally introduced.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.144
That doesn't seem right.
I'm Annalise. Who are you?

19:05.644 --> 19:08.105
Last chance.
People are gonna get hurt.

19:08.856 --> 19:09.857
Go back to Miami.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.286
Mmm. Well, Murillo was right
about one thing.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.746
Nothing like a slice of New York pie.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.000
Fold it.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.209
-Oh. Yeah.
-Yeah.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.714
Sorry. I gotta get this.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.049
Rosie, you were right.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.510
He had a series of
remodeled bone injuries,

19:38.594 --> 19:41.180
many of them re-breaks...
Ribs, wrist, clavicle.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.140
So we're talking a series
of recurring injuries

19:43.223 --> 19:44.308
in otherwise healthy bones.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.018
-So that confirms he was fighting.
-Yeah.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.353
Bro, it wasn't just
Vitamin "K" in his system.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.521
Oh, Pipp, you're there?

19:49.605 --> 19:51.440
No. I'm a hologram.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.359
Same technology they used for Tupac.
Just wish it was better news.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.736
I mean, these "mints"...

19:55.819 --> 19:57.237
They're not just regular steroids.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.489
I found lethal doses
of fluoxymesterone.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.782
That's used in veterinary medicine.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.367
-Like, on a dog?
-Or like a horse,

20:02.451 --> 20:04.286
if you want it to run fast,
or an elephant.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.079
Those mints could kill
an average-size human.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.290
The question is how they got
them into Eddie's system,

20:08.373 --> 20:10.209
because TMI... she can't find
an entry point.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.212
I checked. I checked all the usual
injection spots for steroids...

20:13.629 --> 20:16.340
Stomach, buttocks, hip... Nothing.
So...

20:16.423 --> 20:18.884
Girls, can you turn that
body over for me, please?

20:20.135 --> 20:22.012
I know you're trying to protect me,
Rosie.

20:23.972 --> 20:28.560
But... we're in it together.
I need to see this.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.230
I need to.

20:31.855 --> 20:33.065
Please.

20:33.148 --> 20:35.067
Rosie, body's ready for your eyes.

20:37.444 --> 20:38.612
Tee...

20:39.404 --> 20:41.406
bring the camera slowly
down the scalp, please.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.908
Okay.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.122
All right. Stop, stop.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.457
Zoom in right there.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.251
That's it.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.752
That's what killed him.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.630
He wasn't taking steroids.

20:56.713 --> 20:59.258
Someone injected him with a
lethal dose in a liquid form.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.385
Probably when he was
knocked down in a fight.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.887
He never saw it coming.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.347
Do you realize...

21:05.430 --> 21:07.432
The moment we exhumed
Eddie's body in Miami,

21:07.516 --> 21:10.060
we triggered the attention
of a lot of dangerous people.

21:10.143 --> 21:11.603
We need to get back to that gym.

21:19.486 --> 21:22.823
Do you have any desire to let
me know why we're really here?

21:22.906 --> 21:23.740
No offense, Ira,

21:23.824 --> 21:25.450
but I feel like
you'd be a lot more fun

21:25.534 --> 21:26.827
if you drank something.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.245
Lucia.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.164
How did you find me here?

21:41.049 --> 21:42.467
Are you kidding me?

21:42.676 --> 21:45.304
What was the whole
cosmetic counter bit, then?

21:45.387 --> 21:46.763
I didn't know where she worked.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.223
And it's not what you think.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.058
Oh, no. I get it.

21:50.517 --> 21:51.643
You see hookers.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.520
I've never touched her, all right?
She's a friend.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.022
A friend you paid to schtup.

21:55.522 --> 21:56.773
You ever get insomnia, Ira?

21:56.857 --> 21:58.567
I get agita.
It's kind of the same thing.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.527
Keeps me up.
But yeah, I know what you mean.

22:00.610 --> 22:01.611
Yeah, 'cause you and I,

22:01.695 --> 22:03.613
we see a lot of things during the day,
don't we?

22:03.697 --> 22:05.407
When I go to sleep, I still see them.

22:05.782 --> 22:06.908
So...

22:07.701 --> 22:09.161
I pay her to read to me.

22:09.578 --> 22:10.787
It helps me fall asleep.

22:10.871 --> 22:11.872
She reads?

22:11.955 --> 22:14.124
I'm not gonna lie... That's unnatural.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.959
-And reads what?
-Doesn't matter.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.837
Sports scores, YA novels,
the back of a shampoo bottle.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.464
Just the sound of a sweet voice.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.092
Hey. Excuse me. You Cameron?

22:24.176 --> 22:25.427
-Yeah.
-Hey, man, how are you?

22:25.510 --> 22:26.553
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:28.638 --> 22:30.223
You know,
I've been wanting to chat with you.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.725
Like a... Like reasonable men.

22:31.808 --> 22:33.310
I'm pretty reasonable, aren't I, Ira?

22:33.393 --> 22:35.812
Well... Depends what scale
we're talking about.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.898
Yeah, well, you know,
here's the thing, Cam.

22:37.981 --> 22:40.984
I've gotten to know one of your
employees pretty well... Lucia.

22:41.234 --> 22:42.277
Sweet girl.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.653
She's a great girl, right?

22:43.737 --> 22:45.322
Yeah, you see, we have this little,

22:45.405 --> 22:47.282
reading group together,
and I compensate her

22:47.366 --> 22:48.575
nicely for it, but I don't know...

22:48.658 --> 22:50.452
She tells me
that she never sees a dime of it

22:50.535 --> 22:52.621
because it all goes into your
trying-too-hard pants pocket.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.581
And you don't help me sleep, do you?

22:54.664 --> 22:57.167
-No.
-Right. See, I didn't think so.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.086
Now, Cam, look into my eyes.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.296
Dreamy, right?

23:01.963 --> 23:03.298
Those are just a glassy facade

23:03.382 --> 23:05.675
for the true crazy
swirling behind them.

23:05.759 --> 23:09.137
See, you don't know me or what I do,
but I assure you... I have the power

23:09.221 --> 23:10.806
to turn this place
into a puppy shelter,

23:10.889 --> 23:13.392
which would be a way
better use of the space.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.977
But, like I told you,
I am a reasonable man.

23:17.020 --> 23:20.190
So what do we say you make sure
I never catch wind

23:20.273 --> 23:21.983
of you not treating someone like Lucia

23:22.067 --> 23:24.403
with the kind of decency
and respect she deserves?

23:25.487 --> 23:26.947
Does that sound reasonable?

23:27.697 --> 23:28.698
Yeah.

23:36.206 --> 23:39.960
Uh... I got to say, you...

23:41.503 --> 23:43.130
put some words together.

23:51.221 --> 23:53.056
I have to go take care of something.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.141
It's personal.

23:54.224 --> 23:55.225
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

23:56.393 --> 23:57.644
I don't have cooties.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.105
Let's go.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.406
- Listen.
- Hey!

24:09.489 --> 24:10.949
Come on, get away from the body!

24:11.408 --> 24:13.034
We don't...
We don't keep any money here.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.078
I said get away from the body... now!

24:15.454 --> 24:17.747
Okay, okay. Just deal with me.

24:17.831 --> 24:18.957
Let her go.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.001
I'll give you
whatever it is that you want.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.633
That trainer
was hiding something,

24:28.717 --> 24:30.218
but there's always a paper trail.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.345
Rosie, come look at this.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.558
-What am I looking at?
-It's Eddie.

24:36.641 --> 24:37.851
Where does it say "Eddie"?

24:37.934 --> 24:40.145
It doesn't, but it says "H. 4793."

24:40.228 --> 24:41.271
That's Eddie's middle initial

24:41.354 --> 24:43.440
and the last four of
his Social Security number.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.066
It must be a code for names.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.277
Why is Eddie's name on a list?

24:47.360 --> 24:48.570
Look here.

24:48.653 --> 24:49.946
Multiple checks written to the gym.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.531
Look where the checks come from.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.825
Ree Co. R-E-E Co.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.160
"Rico" isn't a guy. It's a company.

24:55.243 --> 24:58.121
And whoever is behind that company
was a man Eddie was afraid of.

24:59.915 --> 25:00.999
Wait a minute.

25:01.541 --> 25:02.751
Jacott. That's it.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.377
That's Eddie's kid from the school...
Oliver Jacott.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.963
Made a fortune in
the life-insurance game.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.132
Lives in a giant spread
out in the Hamptons.

25:09.716 --> 25:11.676
All these checks are written
for charitable donations

25:11.760 --> 25:14.596
to the gym for new equipment,
upgrades.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.473
I didn't see a punching bag
hanging in there

25:16.556 --> 25:17.557
that was less than 30 years old.

25:17.641 --> 25:18.767
Then what did they use the money for?

25:33.198 --> 25:34.908
Hey, Bennie, what are you doing here?

25:36.076 --> 25:37.410
I sleep here.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.621
You broke in. You need to go.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.706
Easy, buddy. We just want to talk.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.166
You remember us, right?

25:43.416 --> 25:44.793
I sensed you wanted to help.

25:44.876 --> 25:45.919
Now's your chance.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.421
But before you start yapping, a mint?

25:48.964 --> 25:50.340
You're kind of blasting us
from over there.

25:50.423 --> 25:51.841
Yeah, foetor ex ore halitosis.

25:52.425 --> 25:54.219
Or it could be a guilty conscience.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.263
Does a number on the gullet.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.598
Oh, these... These surprise you?

25:58.682 --> 26:00.684
Were those guys selling drugs
from this gym?

26:01.268 --> 26:03.103
-Was Eddie involved?
-Eddie was my friend.

26:03.186 --> 26:05.230
Did Jacott hire him
as muscle for his business?

26:05.313 --> 26:07.607
-How'd you know about Jacott?
-We're asking the questions.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.818
Is that how Eddie got the injuries
to his ribs and his wrists?

26:09.901 --> 26:13.029
No. Eddie didn't work for Jacott.

26:14.864 --> 26:16.157
He fought for him.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.326
High stakes. No gloves.

26:19.327 --> 26:20.787
No rules.

26:20.870 --> 26:23.081
Jacott witnessed Eddie
punching the principal.

26:23.164 --> 26:24.541
That's why he didn't
want to get him fired.

26:24.624 --> 26:26.251
He saw something way better.

26:26.334 --> 26:27.877
He was making money off
of Eddie's fighting.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.462
But why would he get involved?

26:29.546 --> 26:31.965
Same reason everyone else did...
For the money.

26:32.048 --> 26:33.341
But that's...

26:34.801 --> 26:37.137
Eddie didn't need to risk
his life for extra money.

26:39.222 --> 26:40.724
You know,
when the little Lunez comes,

26:40.807 --> 26:42.183
you're gonna put
that gun away for good.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.476
Yeah, really?

26:43.560 --> 26:46.354
Are you planning on winning
the lottery or something?

26:50.483 --> 26:51.860
Oh, no, no.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.862
Look at me. Look at me.

26:53.945 --> 26:54.988
Having a baby...

26:55.405 --> 26:58.074
I'm not gonna be able
to retire anytime soon.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.410
I won't let you risk getting hurt.

27:02.954 --> 27:04.122
Listen.

27:05.624 --> 27:06.958
I will take care of us.

27:08.835 --> 27:09.961
Always.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.339
Did Jacott supply you with steroids?

27:12.505 --> 27:15.091
That was available,
but Eddie didn't use any.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.926
-Wasn't his thing.
-But you did.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.347
That's what caused the shaking
in your hands and in your neck.

27:20.430 --> 27:23.266
I had a promising career... 8-0.

27:23.767 --> 27:27.437
Man, you don't understand...
That drug, it's crazy.

27:27.520 --> 27:31.650
I didn't want to take them,
but it made me feel invincible,

27:31.733 --> 27:33.568
like I could fight the world.

27:34.361 --> 27:35.945
And then the seizures started.

27:36.529 --> 27:38.365
And it destroyed
any chances that I had.

27:38.448 --> 27:39.741
It destroyed me.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.534
Eddie saw that happen.

27:41.868 --> 27:43.328
He wanted to do something about it.

27:43.411 --> 27:44.704
Can you get us into that mansion?

27:44.788 --> 27:47.457
You need to be a fighter,
have someone sponsor you...

27:47.540 --> 27:49.459
A minimum of a 50k buy-in.

27:49.542 --> 27:51.086
But that's not a good idea.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.547
Bad things happen
inside of those gates of that place.

28:03.139 --> 28:04.683
Drop it! EMPD.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.017
Drop it!

28:08.311 --> 28:10.397
-Well, that was efficient.
-I think we're in the clear.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.898
Hornstock, did you
just save our lives?

28:11.981 --> 28:14.192
Listen, Rosie knows I'm here.
Everything's gonna be okay.

28:14.275 --> 28:15.652
I just need you two to go upstairs

28:15.735 --> 28:17.862
and give Captain Slade
and I some privacy, okay?

28:17.946 --> 28:19.030
Yeah. All right.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.281
It's all okay.

28:21.074 --> 28:23.827
Hey. Stuff on the line.
Maybe I got it from here.

28:23.910 --> 28:25.912
Well, the book says
we read him his rights,

28:25.995 --> 28:28.123
we bring him in,
and we question him proper.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.291
Yeah, I can't do that.

28:36.589 --> 28:38.174
Who sent you? Start talking!

28:39.759 --> 28:43.263
Who... sent... you?

28:44.055 --> 28:45.223
Go straight to hell!

28:46.349 --> 28:47.684
He's not in a talky mood.

28:52.856 --> 28:53.898
All right, you little bitch,

28:53.982 --> 28:56.234
I'm gonna give you two seconds
to speak before I gut you

28:56.317 --> 28:58.027
and have you bleed all
over this shiny floor.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.446
You got me?

28:59.779 --> 29:01.030
You think I'm kidding?

29:01.114 --> 29:02.115
You crazy, man?

29:02.198 --> 29:04.784
All right, all right, all right!
Some guy from New York, okay?

29:04.868 --> 29:06.786
Supposed, to get rid of his body.

29:06.870 --> 29:07.912
Why?

29:08.329 --> 29:09.414
Why?

29:09.497 --> 29:13.126
Oh, man. Drugs, all right?
Supposed to cover up his drugs, man.

29:13.209 --> 29:14.961
That's all I know. I swear.

29:17.338 --> 29:18.882
All right, you're gonna call this guy,

29:18.965 --> 29:21.134
and in your very, very happy voice,

29:21.217 --> 29:22.635
you're gonna tell him
everything's okay...

29:22.719 --> 29:24.971
you're successful,
and you dealt with the body.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.932
And then you and I are gonna
talk all about these drugs.

29:28.558 --> 29:29.559
Dial.

29:30.393 --> 29:31.436
Dial!

29:35.899 --> 29:38.777
Rosie, I slept on it...
Or didn't sleep.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.195
Point is...

29:42.363 --> 29:43.364
We're good.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.246
Rosie, who the hell was that?

29:50.330 --> 29:51.372
I'm making moves here.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.500
The only moves you need
are to roll your socks,

29:53.583 --> 29:55.418
pack your underwear,
and head back to the airport.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.712
Well, I'm not going anywhere,
and I never roll my socks.

29:57.796 --> 29:58.797
Stretches the material.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.673
Fine, then don't roll anything.
Just go.

30:00.757 --> 30:01.841
I mean, you know, you roll,

30:01.925 --> 30:03.510
and then, you know,
you lose elasticity.

30:03.593 --> 30:04.677
Then they start rolling
down to your ankles,

30:04.761 --> 30:06.763
and then nobody wants that.
I don't want that. Do you want that?

30:06.846 --> 30:08.807
Okay, I can't have you here anymore.

30:08.890 --> 30:12.060
I'm not sure what I'm even gonna do,
but I'm doing it alone.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.353
-That's not gonna happen.
-No, no, no.

30:13.436 --> 30:15.313
The thing is, you don't understand.
I did this.

30:15.396 --> 30:17.732
Things I said got Eddie
wrapped up in this world.

30:19.025 --> 30:19.943
It's my fault, okay?

30:20.026 --> 30:22.654
His death is my fault,
and if anyone's gonna get hurt,

30:22.737 --> 30:24.781
-it's gonna be me.
-We're getting into the mansion.

30:24.864 --> 30:27.534
We have no way in... Or backup.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.202
And we would need a fighter.

30:29.285 --> 30:31.496
I'm your fighter.
You're looking at him.

30:31.579 --> 30:32.705
What are you talking about?

30:32.789 --> 30:34.457
I reached out to Bennie.
He gave me a name.

30:34.541 --> 30:35.542
That's who that guy was.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.585
He was supposed to fight.
I paid him to walk away.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.003
I'm his replacement.

30:39.712 --> 30:42.090
No. No, no, no. It's too dangerous.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.967
Villa, if the Rosewoods are
good at anything,

30:44.050 --> 30:45.385
we're good at bobbing and weaving.

30:45.468 --> 30:47.220
We're weavers, see? Let's weave.

30:47.303 --> 30:48.388
See, that's the bob.

30:48.471 --> 30:49.597
-Okay, wait...
-No, no, that's the bob.

30:49.681 --> 30:50.849
-This is the weave.
-What... What...

30:50.932 --> 30:52.058
You got to do shoulder like that.
That's the weave.

30:52.141 --> 30:53.852
Plus, I can stall until
you get what you need.

30:53.935 --> 30:56.020
What about the 50k? Where are we
gonna get that kind of cash?

30:56.104 --> 30:57.146
Paid that, too.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.815
Wired to Jacott this morning,
5:00 AM.

30:58.898 --> 31:00.650
Gave me the pass code to the entrance.

31:00.733 --> 31:01.860
We're in.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.404
Rosie, you...

31:08.908 --> 31:10.535
You were up since 5:00 AM?

31:10.785 --> 31:11.744
I was working out.

31:12.704 --> 31:13.830
I got a fight coming up.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.215
I'm gonna use my code word
at the gate.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.634
You're gonna gain entrance to
the pool party here as a guest.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.177
You sure you can get in?

31:28.261 --> 31:30.763
Don't worry.
You're looking at my code word.

31:31.055 --> 31:32.432
All right, here we go, then.

31:36.394 --> 31:37.562
Go on through.

31:40.523 --> 31:42.567
I've checked in for the fight. Rosie.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.193
So you're the replacement.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.862
And you put up your own membership.

31:46.112 --> 31:47.113
I only bet on myself.

31:47.196 --> 31:49.157
Please show our fighter
to the changing rooms.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.409
You're matched up with Hemoglovich.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.453
Who's Hemoglovich?

31:57.332 --> 31:59.626
Once I'm situated,
I'll find you at the party.

32:01.669 --> 32:03.463
Look for me at the south
lawn service entrance.

32:03.546 --> 32:04.589
Villa.

32:09.302 --> 32:11.179
They're blurry. It's hard to tell.

32:11.971 --> 32:13.681
I'm thinking this one is the floors,

32:13.765 --> 32:15.308
and the window's
somewhere inside here.

32:15.391 --> 32:16.726
Eddie was documenting a trail.

32:16.809 --> 32:18.603
Okay, look, you do your thing.
You find those steroids.

32:18.686 --> 32:20.396
You get our proof
that he killed Eddie.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.856
Then we call it in, and that's it.

32:21.940 --> 32:22.815
-Okay.
-That's it?

32:22.899 --> 32:24.025
That's it.

32:24.984 --> 32:26.402
Rosie, please be careful.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.446
Bob and weave, baby.

32:28.821 --> 32:30.156
Just in case.

32:48.841 --> 32:50.426
Standing 6 feet tall

32:50.510 --> 32:54.931
and hailing from the city of Miami...
Rosie!

33:03.231 --> 33:07.318
Standing 6'7"
tall and weighing in at 292 pounds,

33:07.402 --> 33:09.779
hailing from the rough
streets of Brooklyn...

33:09.862 --> 33:11.864
Ivan Hemoglovich!

33:20.623 --> 33:21.749
Time!

33:33.386 --> 33:35.388
Ma'am. You can't be in this hallway.

33:35.471 --> 33:37.849
Oh. I'm... sorry.
I was just looking for the bathroom.

33:37.932 --> 33:40.768
-Not down this hall.
-You are so damn fine.

33:41.310 --> 33:44.105
-Thank you.
-Papi, you are my type of flavor.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.231
Ma'am, follow me this way. Come on.

33:45.314 --> 33:46.607
Please, come on.

34:18.806 --> 34:19.891
Time!

34:20.558 --> 34:21.392
Yeah!

34:22.060 --> 34:23.394
Saved by the bell, baby!

34:23.478 --> 34:24.937
My money's still on you, bro!

34:25.021 --> 34:26.189
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

34:32.153 --> 34:33.696
Base, I need help... Right away.

34:38.868 --> 34:39.786
Time!

35:24.872 --> 35:25.915
Gotcha.

35:29.001 --> 35:30.294
-Rosie.
-We got to get out of here.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.130
Jacott's onto us.
He'll find us any second.

35:32.213 --> 35:33.214
You got what we need to nail him?

35:33.297 --> 35:34.590
-Yeah. I do.
-All right, good.

35:34.674 --> 35:35.675
We're gonna call in the cavalry

35:35.758 --> 35:37.093
and we're gonna
end this thing safely, okay?

35:37.176 --> 35:38.386
-Okay.
-Let's go.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.307
Villa, don't do that! Open the door!

35:43.391 --> 35:45.101
This is between me and
Eddie's killer now.

35:45.184 --> 35:46.352
What are you doing?

35:46.435 --> 35:47.270
Villa!

35:47.353 --> 35:50.273
-Oh, look. I brought my gun, too.
-Villa!

35:50.356 --> 35:51.941
Your husband, Eddie,
was a good fighter.

35:52.024 --> 35:54.235
Had a great right hook.
We made a lot of money together.

35:54.318 --> 35:56.404
But he knew too much
about my other business...

35:56.487 --> 35:57.530
Tried to be a hero.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.198
Does it run in the family?

35:59.448 --> 36:00.825
What are you doing, Villa?

36:00.908 --> 36:01.784
Open the door.

36:01.868 --> 36:05.454
You know, in the insurance game,
my job is to use actuaries

36:05.538 --> 36:07.790
to predict the length
of people's lives.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.917
With your physique and flawless skin,

36:10.001 --> 36:12.628
you're a good bet to
be around for a long time.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.797
But the thing that actuaries
don't take into account

36:14.881 --> 36:18.259
is people who make dumb decisions
and get themselves killed.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.344
And that was Eddie.

36:20.636 --> 36:21.679
Maybe that's me, too.

36:22.597 --> 36:25.433
But I know I'm a good enough
shot to take you down with me.

36:27.894 --> 36:30.271
Wait, wait. You guys are...
You guys are the ones from...

36:30.354 --> 36:32.815
We're DEA. No time to explain.
Step out of the way.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.358
Wait, wait.
Okay, they have guns pointed.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.986
-You're gonna get her shot.
-Step away before we remove you.

36:37.069 --> 36:38.905
Let's go!

36:39.697 --> 36:41.073
Move! Go! Move!

36:41.866 --> 36:43.117
Right here! I got him!

36:43.659 --> 36:44.493
Are you okay?

36:44.577 --> 36:46.621
I'm fine. It's just a graze.

36:46.704 --> 36:48.873
Just make sure that bastard
stays alive.

36:57.673 --> 36:58.883
So, you knew about Eddie
the whole time?

36:58.966 --> 37:00.968
He came to us about
Jacott and the drugs.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.137
It launched what's been
a two and a half year investigation.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.556
-But why did he...
-He didn't want to put you in danger.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.225
He was trying to protect you,
and so were we.

37:07.433 --> 37:08.684
It's been building up to this weekend,

37:08.768 --> 37:11.062
when we knew there was
a huge shipment coming in.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.898
And we were doing
our own investigation.

37:14.148 --> 37:17.068
We had to try and get you to back off.
We couldn't risk our own operation.

37:17.151 --> 37:18.569
Eddie was trying to do
the right thing.

37:18.694 --> 37:21.572
And he died because of it. Detective,
you should know...

37:21.656 --> 37:22.698
This is all because of Eddie.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.117
It was his info that let us
take down this whole operation.

37:35.711 --> 37:37.255
Oh, hey. You're here.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.131
Left my phone charger. So...

37:40.299 --> 37:43.219
Let me help you find that.
Is it over there or...

37:43.302 --> 37:44.470
Oh. You found it.

37:44.553 --> 37:45.930
-I found it.
-Nice.

37:47.682 --> 37:48.766
Pipp.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.894
You stepped in front
of a bullet for me.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.563
It's not like he shot, so...

37:55.815 --> 37:57.358
But that's the kind of thing
people do in movies

37:57.441 --> 37:59.151
when they're crazy about each other.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.404
I'll always be crazy about you.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.368
But, Tee, you got to let me go.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.163
So that I can maybe
find my own way back.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.143
Rosie.

38:33.894 --> 38:35.563
-Thank you.
-No. No, thank you.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.024
Why would you be thanking me?

38:38.190 --> 38:40.818
Well, I've been given
a lot of gifts in my life.

38:41.402 --> 38:42.737
But what we have, how we work,

38:42.820 --> 38:44.613
all the stuff we're
able to do together...

38:45.781 --> 38:46.657
Nothing beats it.

38:47.366 --> 38:48.909
Well, that's a relief, 'cause...

38:49.785 --> 38:53.414
I was gonna get you something,
like a sweater or something.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.334
But I guess I'm good now.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.131
So, all those doubts
that you had about...

39:02.673 --> 39:04.425
the kind of man
that Eddie really was...

39:04.508 --> 39:06.427
He was better than I ever knew.

39:10.264 --> 39:11.891
So, where do we go from here?

39:15.061 --> 39:15.978
Home.

39:31.327 --> 39:33.204
-Ira. Thanks for popping in.
-Sure.

39:33.954 --> 39:35.414
I was just going over this report.

39:35.915 --> 39:36.874
What report?

39:38.918 --> 39:40.669
The report of what happened
at the lab.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.340
I told you that was personal.
Why the report?

39:45.383 --> 39:48.928
You know... I wasn't gonna, really.

39:49.261 --> 39:51.180
But when I remembered
you announced yourself

39:51.263 --> 39:54.225
as a detective of my department,
you put the badge on the line,

39:54.350 --> 39:56.268
which kind of makes it sticky, man.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.481
I had no choice.
You understand, right?

40:01.524 --> 40:02.566
I understand.

40:02.900 --> 40:03.943
Well, good.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.821
Why don't you do me a favor?
Walk this upstairs.

40:08.614 --> 40:09.990
Just let the chips fall as they may.

40:16.372 --> 40:18.040
I know you got something on me.

40:19.291 --> 40:20.668
I know what my demons are.

40:21.544 --> 40:24.547
What I did to that man this time
was out of loyalty to a friend.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.091
You want to know my weakness?

40:27.174 --> 40:28.217
That's it.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.177
Protecting the people I love.

40:30.803 --> 40:32.346
You know what that feels like?

40:32.888 --> 40:34.515
My guess is you don't.

40:36.142 --> 40:37.685
I have no regrets.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.064
In fact, I would do it again
any day of the week.

40:43.065 --> 40:45.025
So you want this report
walked somewhere?

40:46.735 --> 40:48.028
You walk it yourself.

41:01.917 --> 41:03.961
Well. Look who's back.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.089
You enjoy your much-needed R&R?

41:08.048 --> 41:10.885
It was the best. I feel rejuvenated,

41:11.677 --> 41:12.720
like a new woman.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.305
Good.

41:14.388 --> 41:15.764
'Cause here's your next case.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.225
It's a doozy.

41:32.239 --> 41:35.159
Hey, you better not be climbing
into this bed with cookies!

41:35.242 --> 41:37.786
Oh. "This bed"? You mean "our bed."

41:38.579 --> 41:40.122
Well, I guess for somebody,

41:40.206 --> 41:41.999
wedding vows
and promises mean nothing.

41:42.082 --> 41:43.459
Wait. No, no, no.

41:43.542 --> 41:45.294
The "no eating cookies in bed"
vow was meant for you.

41:45.377 --> 41:47.004
-Is that right?
-That's right.

41:48.214 --> 41:50.299
You can't match my
cookie-eating skills, girl.

41:50.549 --> 41:51.675
Been doing it since I was a kid.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.011
I can eat a whole cookie
without dropping a single crumb.

41:54.094 --> 41:56.138
You can't take a bite without
leaving it all in the sheets.

41:56.222 --> 41:59.225
-That is not true.
-It's true, Lissie. It's true.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.727
You are good at a great many things.

42:01.810 --> 42:03.604
Eating cookies in bed
is not one of them.

42:04.980 --> 42:07.858
So, what are you saying?
I just have to...

42:07.942 --> 42:10.819
just put up with this
for the rest of my life? Hmm?

42:11.695 --> 42:13.155
For the rest of your life.

42:14.865 --> 42:16.492
Even when I'm 80 years old

42:17.743 --> 42:21.288
and I've got ear and nose hair
and a hump on my back.

42:23.874 --> 42:25.960
But you will still be
the most beautiful woman

42:26.043 --> 42:28.045
that I've ever eaten
cookies in bed with.
