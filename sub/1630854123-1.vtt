WEBVTT

00:02.263 --> 00:05.396
The number is 30.

00:05.483 --> 00:07.311
Two days ago,
you said it was 15.

00:07.398 --> 00:09.879
Things have changed.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.228
What things, Curt?

00:11.315 --> 00:14.101
Demand is strong,
supply is weak.

00:14.188 --> 00:16.059
It's Economics 101, my brother.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.887
100% bump in two days--
that is not economics.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.497
That is robbery.

00:19.584 --> 00:21.673
This inflation thing is real.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.894
Supply chain issues,
labor shortages--

00:24.981 --> 00:27.418
prices are skyrocketing.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.594
Is this guy a bomb broker
or an economist?

00:29.681 --> 00:31.988
<i>Worth every penny.</i>

00:32.075 --> 00:33.033
<i>Take a look for yourself.</i>

00:33.120 --> 00:36.253
Snapped that earlier today.

00:38.473 --> 00:41.737
25 blocks of C4,
two trigger mechanisms.

00:41.824 --> 00:44.131
I mean, listen,
I could go on and on.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.871
But the only thing
that really matters

00:45.958 --> 00:47.917
is the damn thing can blow up
an entire city block.

00:48.004 --> 00:48.657
<i>Looks good.</i>

00:48.744 --> 00:50.224
Is he bluffing?

00:50.311 --> 00:52.052
I sure hope so.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.054
25 and we got a deal.

00:55.794 --> 00:58.058
20 is the highest
I'm willing to go.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.582
And I have it all
right here with me, too.

01:05.413 --> 01:07.154
Cool.

01:07.241 --> 01:09.678
I think we got a deal.

01:09.765 --> 01:13.551
So I just got to see the cash,
and we're good to go.

01:16.206 --> 01:17.773
<i>I'm really glad
we're doing this, Curt.</i>

01:17.860 --> 01:19.470
<i>Me too.</i>

01:19.557 --> 01:20.863
<i>And please don't tell me
what you're planning to do</i>

01:20.950 --> 01:22.647
<i>with the damn thing.</i>

01:22.734 --> 01:23.822
<i>Don't want to know.</i>

01:23.909 --> 01:25.520
<i>Fair enough.</i>

01:29.263 --> 01:30.916
Feel free to count it.

01:33.354 --> 01:35.443
OK.

01:35.530 --> 01:36.661
Cool.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.228
Come with me.

01:38.315 --> 01:40.143
- I'll follow you in my car.
- No.

01:40.230 --> 01:43.233
Come with me...

01:43.320 --> 01:46.323
in my car.

01:49.848 --> 01:53.025
Hey, it feels like a rip.

01:53.113 --> 01:53.983
Like I said,
I'll follow you in--

01:54.070 --> 01:57.029
Come with me or no deal.

02:04.994 --> 02:07.039
OK, buddy.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.650
Not a problem.

02:14.482 --> 02:17.963
Hey, Omar.
Do not get in that car.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.188
Relax, bro.

02:26.885 --> 02:28.670
You got to learn
to trust people.

02:28.757 --> 02:30.324
Yeah.

02:30.411 --> 02:31.760
Sorry, I'm a little paranoid.

02:31.847 --> 02:33.718
And the more someone
tells me to trust them,

02:33.805 --> 02:35.720
the more I don't, Curt.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.157
I respect that.

02:39.768 --> 02:41.639
We're here.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.424
OK.

03:02.138 --> 03:03.966
You're going to like
Anish, my partner.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.750
This guy is smart as hell.

03:05.837 --> 03:08.536
Went to MIT, like for real.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.061
What the...

03:15.847 --> 03:17.762
Anish?

03:21.113 --> 03:23.246
Anish?

03:23.333 --> 03:26.554
You alive?

03:26.641 --> 03:28.730
There's no pulse.

03:32.429 --> 03:33.778
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.215
This can't be happening.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.869
What the hell is going on?

03:37.956 --> 03:40.829
OA, we need to know
if that bomb is there.

03:40.916 --> 03:41.917
<i>Stay in character.</i>

03:42.004 --> 03:44.746
Uh, OK. Uh...

03:44.833 --> 03:46.922
OK, look, hey, hey.

03:47.009 --> 03:48.663
I don't want to be that guy,
but we're not going to be able

03:48.750 --> 03:50.882
to bring your buddy
back to life, right?

03:50.969 --> 03:52.449
So let's get through
with the deal.

03:52.536 --> 03:53.798
And let's get the hell
out of here.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.191
What do you say?
- That sounds good.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.888
Just, uh, follow me.
- All right, let's go.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.812
- Ugh.
- What?

04:07.899 --> 04:10.511
I--I--I don't know where--I--

04:15.472 --> 04:17.474
Sorry, is this
some kind of game to you?

04:17.561 --> 04:18.649
Are you playing with me?
- Hell no.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.172
I'm--I'm just trying to--

04:20.260 --> 04:21.696
You said there
was a bomb here.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.088
That is why we are here, Curt.
Where is the bomb?

04:23.175 --> 04:24.873
<i>- I told you, I don't know.
- Where is the bomb?</i>

04:24.960 --> 04:25.830
<i>Back off.</i>

04:27.571 --> 04:28.920
- Let's go.

04:32.097 --> 04:34.012
Curt Mallory,
you are under arrest.

04:34.099 --> 04:36.406
Who the hell are you?

04:36.493 --> 04:39.279
FBI.

04:44.196 --> 04:45.720
Thanks for breakfast.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.156
Yeah, yeah.
Well--

04:47.243 --> 04:48.592
It's nice.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.377
It felt like old times.
- Really?

04:50.464 --> 04:51.682
See you tonight?

04:51.769 --> 04:54.642
Yeah, of course.
It's your birthday.

04:54.729 --> 04:56.557
You only turn 15 once, right?

04:56.644 --> 04:59.821
You said that last year
when I turned 14.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.126
Well, it was also true then.

05:01.213 --> 05:03.607
Hey, you need a taxi?

05:03.694 --> 05:05.305
No, I'll just use one
of my rideshare apps.

05:05.392 --> 05:06.523
You sure?
It's right here.

05:06.610 --> 05:09.265
Yeah, I know.
But cabs are lame.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.485
Cabs are lame.
Oh, OK.

05:11.572 --> 05:13.269
Well, whatever you want.

05:13.356 --> 05:16.228
I can get you a horse-drawn
carriage, if you'd rather.

05:16.316 --> 05:20.929
Maybe a rickshaw if
that's more your speed?

05:21.016 --> 05:22.583
Well, that's the first time

05:22.670 --> 05:25.281
I've seen him smile
in a few weeks.

05:27.239 --> 05:29.111
Yeah, what do you mean?

05:31.548 --> 05:33.681
He's just going through one
of those teenage boy phases.

05:34.899 --> 05:37.293
Right.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.860
So you're picking up
the cake, right?

05:38.947 --> 05:40.296
Uh, yeah, yeah.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.429
No, I know an amazing place.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.256
Great, well,
stop by around 7:00 or so.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.432
- Yep.
- It'll be fun--

05:45.519 --> 05:48.086
10 kids, pizza, video games.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.001
Yeah, it sounds perfect.

05:50.088 --> 05:51.176
Let me guess.

05:51.263 --> 05:52.569
All right, I'll see you.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.963
Ty, I love you.
See you tonight.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.316
Hey, Isobel. What's up?

06:00.403 --> 06:02.013
Yeah, I'll be there
in 10 minutes.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.364
All right, let's check
for chemicals, prints, DNA.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.453
I'm guessing they didn't
just store the bomb here.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.280
Probably built it here, too.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.674
OK, Curt, the more you
tell us, the more you help,

06:10.761 --> 06:11.980
the lighter your
sentence is going to be.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.547
Do you understand?

06:13.634 --> 06:14.591
You're only going to get
one bite at this apple.

06:14.678 --> 06:17.115
So you better make it count.

06:17.202 --> 06:20.554
Like I told you, Ramy,
or whatever your real name is--

06:20.641 --> 06:21.946
It is Omar.

06:22.033 --> 06:24.079
OK, Omar, like I told you,

06:24.166 --> 06:26.168
I had no idea any of this
was going to happen.

06:26.255 --> 06:28.475
None.
I liked Anish, a lot.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.041
We were friends.

06:30.128 --> 06:31.869
OK, I believe you for now.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.828
But you got to give us
something that we can use.

06:33.915 --> 06:35.656
Did anybody else
know about this bomb?

06:35.743 --> 06:38.920
You have any other
potential buyers?

06:39.007 --> 06:40.443
One.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.793
I met with him earlier today,

06:42.880 --> 06:45.187
about an hour
before I met with Omar.

06:45.274 --> 06:46.710
What did you discuss?

06:46.797 --> 06:48.016
Price.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.583
Guy didn't have a lot of money.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.933
But he was eager to do
the deal, too eager.

06:52.020 --> 06:54.718
I-I got nervous.

06:54.805 --> 06:57.591
I thought he might have been
a cop, so I blew him off.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.288
OK, what was his name?

06:59.375 --> 07:01.812
I think he said his name
was Nate, something like that.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.510
I don't know his last name.

07:03.597 --> 07:04.728
How did you get in
contact with Nate?

07:04.815 --> 07:06.077
Do you have his phone number?

07:06.164 --> 07:07.339
No, we did it through
encrypted chat.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.429
What did he look like--
height, build?

07:09.516 --> 07:12.823
Short dark hair,
medium height.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.739
We need to know what time
and where you met with Nate,

07:15.826 --> 07:17.262
what street.

07:17.349 --> 07:20.178
Be as specific as you can.

07:23.355 --> 07:25.227
Hey.
What's going on?

07:25.314 --> 07:26.837
OA said this thing was
just getting started.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.360
- Well, things accelerated.
- Yeah.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.624
After weeks of talking
in a chat room,

07:30.711 --> 07:32.321
OA finally met with the broker.

07:32.408 --> 07:34.192
The plan was to
establish credibility,

07:34.279 --> 07:35.803
do a quick money flash,
but the guy was ready to roll.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.326
So OA went for it.

07:37.413 --> 07:38.501
And when they went
to retrieve the device,

07:38.588 --> 07:39.328
the broker's partner was dead.

07:39.415 --> 07:41.199
And the bomb was missing.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.941
Uh-huh, so we have a killer
in the wind with a bomb?

07:44.028 --> 07:45.639
Well, according to the specs,
the broker rattled off,

07:45.726 --> 07:46.944
it is not just a bomb.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.380
It's a big bomb.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.471
We're talking Oklahoma City.

07:51.558 --> 07:52.863
Copy that.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.517
All right, I'll start
digging into the details

07:54.604 --> 07:57.564
and go to work.

07:57.651 --> 07:58.260
How are we doing
with that video?

07:58.347 --> 07:59.914
- Good.
- Yeah?

08:00.001 --> 08:01.263
Just pulled some from
an ATM across the street.

08:01.350 --> 08:02.873
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.222
OK, there's our broker, Curt.

08:04.309 --> 08:07.269
And that must be our suspect.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.576
Can we get a better angle
on his face?

08:09.663 --> 08:11.229
This is the best I can do.

08:11.316 --> 08:13.318
Did you have any luck
with facial rec?

08:17.018 --> 08:18.541
- No, nothing.
- All right, keep looking.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.238
There's got to
be another angle.

08:20.325 --> 08:21.544
Yep, found
another street cam.

08:21.631 --> 08:22.371
All right,
let's keep it going.

08:22.458 --> 08:23.981
Throw it up.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.330
All right, I don't
know about his face.

08:25.417 --> 08:26.549
But we can definitely
see his car.

08:26.636 --> 08:27.811
Get that license plate number.

08:27.898 --> 08:30.684
Yep, yep, running it now.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.512
OK, Jorge Rubio--

08:32.599 --> 08:34.296
short dark hair, medium height.

08:34.383 --> 08:35.993
That matches
Curt's description.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.605
But the bomb broker
said his name was Nate.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.302
I used to say I was 6' 3".

08:40.389 --> 08:42.957
Find me that address now.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.700
Hey, what's going on?

08:46.787 --> 08:48.919
<i>Only three kids have RSVPed.</i>

08:49.006 --> 08:50.573
They're boys.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.227
They probably don't even know
what RSVP means, right?

08:52.314 --> 08:54.403
<i>Yeah, but their parents do.</i>

08:54.490 --> 08:56.753
Right, OK, well,
we'll just have to wait

08:56.840 --> 08:59.103
and see who shows up tonight,
OK?

08:59.190 --> 09:00.714
OK, you're not listening
to what I'm saying.

09:00.801 --> 09:01.889
I am.
But what can we do?

09:01.976 --> 09:03.847
We can't control who RSVPs
and who doesn't

09:03.934 --> 09:05.545
or who comes and who doesn't.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.851
All I'm saying is,
we will make it work.

09:07.938 --> 09:11.333
And all I'm saying is
I'm worried about Tyler.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.640
He's not as secure and
confident as you think he is.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.946
What do you--
what do you mean?

09:16.033 --> 09:18.470
He's having a hard time
making friends.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.212
Well, that's what
high school is about,

09:21.299 --> 09:23.998
you know, figuring out who
you like, who you don't like--

09:24.085 --> 09:28.045
<i>Jubal, he eats his lunch
alone in the library.</i>

09:28.132 --> 09:29.699
<i>And...</i>

09:29.786 --> 09:32.397
last night, I heard him
crying in his bedroom.

09:32.484 --> 09:33.877
<i>I asked him what was wrong.</i>

09:33.964 --> 09:35.966
<i>He didn't want
to talk about it.</i>

09:36.053 --> 09:38.360
<i>He's really insecure
about his health--</i>

09:38.447 --> 09:40.797
<i>the leukemia.</i>

09:40.884 --> 09:42.538
<i>He won't admit it
to me or you,</i>

09:42.625 --> 09:44.627
<i>but it's really affecting him.</i>

09:48.500 --> 09:51.373
He'll be OK.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.722
He's tough.
- Hey.

09:52.809 --> 09:53.984
Sorry to interrupt.
- Yeah?

09:54.071 --> 09:54.898
We got an address
on the suspect.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.900
OK.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.423
I got to go.

09:58.510 --> 10:01.470
It's going to be fine.
I promise.

10:30.238 --> 10:31.631
Hands up!

10:31.718 --> 10:33.284
Shut off the music.

10:33.371 --> 10:34.634
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's going on?

10:34.721 --> 10:35.809
Who are you?

10:35.896 --> 10:37.767
What--what are
you doing in here?

10:39.769 --> 10:41.031
Any chemicals or components?

10:41.118 --> 10:42.816
Nothing.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.208
OK, can somebody please tell
me what the hell is going on?

10:44.295 --> 10:45.601
Yeah, but not in here.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.128
Where's your car?

10:51.215 --> 10:53.087
My--my car?
Why?

10:53.174 --> 10:55.263
We're investigating
a homicide.

10:55.350 --> 10:56.481
We have reason to believe
that you were speaking

10:56.568 --> 10:57.874
with the victim today.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.093
Discussing the purchase
of a bomb.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.703
What?

11:00.790 --> 11:04.228
Oh--OK, now you
really lost me.

11:04.315 --> 11:05.882
Is this some kind of joke?

11:05.969 --> 11:07.231
A bomb?

11:07.318 --> 11:09.625
Well, I-I sell
life insurance, man.

11:09.712 --> 11:12.019
We have a video of your car.

11:12.106 --> 11:14.238
The Toyota?
I sold that three days ago.

11:14.325 --> 11:16.240
I just haven't filled out
the DMV paperwork yet.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.938
Who'd you sell it to?

11:18.025 --> 11:19.548
A guy named Nathan.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.811
He lives down the block
with my buddy, Tony.

11:21.898 --> 11:24.118
This guy?

11:24.205 --> 11:25.728
Yeah, yeah.

11:25.815 --> 11:26.860
OK, last name?

11:26.947 --> 11:28.949
I don't know.
I didn't ask.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.341
He paid cash for the car.

11:30.428 --> 11:31.734
All right, you said
he lives down the block.

11:31.821 --> 11:33.518
What house?
And I want the exact address.

11:52.146 --> 11:54.322
I need an ambulance
in my location ASAP.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.541
Sir, sir, can you hear me?

11:56.628 --> 11:57.978
Can you hear me, sir?
What's your name?

11:58.065 --> 11:59.762
Is Nathan here?

11:59.849 --> 12:01.459
No, he--

12:01.546 --> 12:03.635
Is he the one who shot you?

12:03.723 --> 12:06.029
I tried to stop him.

12:06.116 --> 12:07.857
He's going to kill
a lot of people.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.903
Nathan--does he have a bomb?

12:09.990 --> 12:12.470
Where is he going?

12:12.557 --> 12:15.343
Do you know where he's going?

12:15.430 --> 12:18.346
Can you hear me?

12:18.433 --> 12:20.217
He's gone.

12:31.054 --> 12:34.014
His driver's license says
that his name is Tony Wilton.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.798
Well, that would make sense.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.495
Jorge said that Nathan lives
with a guy named Tony.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.933
You think he was heading
into work or coming home?

12:40.020 --> 12:41.586
Shirt looks freshly pressed.

12:41.673 --> 12:44.154
I would say his day
was just starting.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.942
Tony's dead?

12:49.029 --> 12:50.595
You think Nathan did it?

12:50.682 --> 12:51.814
I'm not sure.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.163
Hoping you can help us
figure that out.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.861
I don't know.

12:54.948 --> 12:57.472
But things between the two
of them weren't working out.

12:57.559 --> 13:00.605
Tony said he liked the guy
when they first met.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.520
But when the dude moved in,
things got weird.

13:02.607 --> 13:03.783
In what way?

13:03.870 --> 13:05.523
He was too intense.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.612
He was too angry.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.223
He wanted him to move out.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.702
He asked if I could help
get rid of him.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.704
But I didn't want any
part of that drama.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.055
The dude was scary.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.234
Looks like you made
the right choice.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.893
This is weird, right?

13:26.980 --> 13:29.373
Yeah, I recognize some
of those faces, though.

13:29.460 --> 13:30.635
They're all conservative
right-wingers

13:30.722 --> 13:33.290
who've been in the news.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.379
Dog alerted to the back room.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.164
The bomb was here,
but there's no sign of it now.

13:37.251 --> 13:38.513
OK, what about any guns?

13:38.600 --> 13:41.081
No, but a lot of
extremist paraphernalia--

13:41.168 --> 13:43.561
books, protest, signs,
all railing against the right.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.172
Well, that could be why
he and the missing roommate

13:45.259 --> 13:46.651
wanted a bomb.

13:46.738 --> 13:49.132
So let's get
this scrubbed ASAP.

13:49.219 --> 13:51.265
Can you get this to the JOC?
- Yes, sir.

14:01.884 --> 14:02.929
All right, folks.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.495
Let's talk about this.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.541
Our suspect--let's
call him Nathan for now,

14:06.628 --> 14:07.934
no last name--is out there
somewhere with the bomb.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.936
And it doesn't take a genius
to do the math here.

14:10.023 --> 14:12.286
If you're willing to kill to
get something that goes boom,

14:12.373 --> 14:13.765
you are going to use it.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.419
So let's talk about
possible targets.

14:15.506 --> 14:16.725
Let's talk about whether
we think this guy

14:16.812 --> 14:17.857
is working solo now.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.162
Possibly.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.772
Preliminary ballistic
report confirms

14:20.860 --> 14:22.687
the gun that killed the
bomb-maker also killed Tony.

14:22.774 --> 14:26.126
Right, OK, so maybe we're
dealing with a lone wolf.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.823
Problem is that wolf
is an enigma.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.433
So let's talk about
our dead caterer, Tony.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.870
So far, nobody we've
talked to in his family

14:30.957 --> 14:32.001
has even heard of Nathan.

14:32.088 --> 14:33.220
But what else do
we know about him?

14:33.307 --> 14:34.351
Tony was arrested
twice for failure

14:34.438 --> 14:36.092
to disperse at protests.

14:36.179 --> 14:37.659
But nothing in his past
indicates he's willing to kill

14:37.746 --> 14:38.921
for those beliefs.

14:39.008 --> 14:39.879
Doesn't mean
his friend isn't.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.358
Maybe that was their beef.

14:41.445 --> 14:42.925
Is there any name on the
paperwork at Tony's,

14:43.012 --> 14:45.101
besides his--a utility bill,

14:45.188 --> 14:46.798
maybe a rent check made out
from this Nathan character?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.801
None, there's no visible
money trail between the two.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.978
- Any prints or DNA?
- ERT scrubbed the place.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.719
Only managed to find partial
prints and DNA strands,

14:54.806 --> 14:55.677
nothing conclusive.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.157
Come on, guys.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.680
We need a name,
an email address,

14:58.767 --> 15:00.116
phone number, something.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.465
Yeah, well, I've been
scrubbing the laptop

15:01.552 --> 15:03.032
we've recovered
from Tony's house.

15:03.119 --> 15:05.252
Located a few texts from
some chat between him

15:05.339 --> 15:07.515
and a guy calling himself
Nate Nation.

15:07.602 --> 15:08.733
I'm guessing that's Nathan.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.300
What'd they say?

15:10.387 --> 15:12.694
So the few dated two weeks ago
are kind of general.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.826
Looks like they bonded
over their beliefs.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.133
Both felt the right
was destroying our democracy.

15:17.220 --> 15:20.006
OK, so that is our
top contender for the why.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.790
Now I'll give you a gold star
if you can find me something

15:21.877 --> 15:23.835
more substantive
than political gripes,

15:23.923 --> 15:26.012
something that will actually
help us catch this guy.

15:26.099 --> 15:28.666
OK, here's one from
less than a week ago.

15:28.753 --> 15:31.104
Tony told Nathan he had an
upcoming catering job that was

15:31.191 --> 15:32.844
a perfect target
for them to focus on,

15:32.932 --> 15:34.411
one that would
generate headlines.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.065
All right,
did he say anything else

15:36.152 --> 15:38.894
about this catering job--
where it was, what it was for?

15:38.981 --> 15:40.417
No, nothing.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.028
All right,
get Tiffany and Scola

15:42.115 --> 15:43.768
over to that catering company,
see if we can figure out

15:43.855 --> 15:45.074
what function Tony
was talking about.

15:45.161 --> 15:48.469
Right.

15:48.556 --> 15:51.341
Things have slowed down a lot
because of COVID, the economy.

15:51.428 --> 15:52.995
But we're still pretty busy.

15:53.082 --> 15:55.432
There's a wedding
in two days

15:55.519 --> 15:56.956
then a software
engineering conference

15:57.043 --> 15:58.044
three days after that.

15:58.131 --> 16:00.089
Mind if I take a look?

16:00.176 --> 16:01.438
Thanks.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.832
OK, first function's
in two days.

16:03.919 --> 16:06.835
OK, so look, Tony was wearing
a uniform when he was killed.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.663
Is there anything else that
might be on the schedule

16:08.750 --> 16:10.665
you could think of?

16:10.752 --> 16:13.407
Some conference at a hotel
out in Northport--the Links.

16:13.494 --> 16:16.671
But that already started
about 10 minutes ago.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.629
And, yeah, Tony was
supposed to be there.

16:18.716 --> 16:21.023
Can you pull up
the information for that event?

16:21.110 --> 16:23.460
Lunch to be served
after a keynote speech

16:23.547 --> 16:25.549
by Judge Edward Saunders of the
Southern District of New York.

16:25.636 --> 16:28.770
Hey, Tiff.

16:28.857 --> 16:31.251
- Give me one second.
- Hard-core conservative, OK?

16:31.338 --> 16:32.774
He's been in the news
a lot recently,

16:32.861 --> 16:34.297
praising the Supreme Court's
recent rulings

16:34.384 --> 16:37.170
on abortion, gun rights.

16:37.257 --> 16:38.823
So if he's the guest
of honor, most likely

16:38.910 --> 16:40.608
the attendees have the
same political leaning.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.480
Which means this conference
is one hell of a target

16:43.567 --> 16:45.439
for a guy like Nathan.

16:45.526 --> 16:48.224
OK, I'ma call this in.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.142
Hey, what's up?

16:53.229 --> 16:54.883
Hey, I just got off
the phone with the ADIC.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.624
He feels strongly that we need
to move cautiously on this.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.060
He doesn't want to shut down
the conference

16:58.147 --> 17:00.062
without something
more substantial.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.456
It's the Federalist Society
we're talking about here.

17:02.543 --> 17:03.544
There's too many ways
it could backfire.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.111
If it turns out
to be a false alarm,

17:05.198 --> 17:06.808
we'll be the lead on every
right-wing news channel

17:06.895 --> 17:07.983
for the next few months.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.463
All right, copy that.

17:09.550 --> 17:10.420
Deploy agents
to that golf course.

17:10.507 --> 17:11.769
Tell them to stay tucked away.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.467
And if we get eyes
on Nathan or his vehicle,

17:13.554 --> 17:15.904
we evacuate immediately.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.689
Oh, they caught a break.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.213
Kelly, what's up?
I'm right here.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.823
Yeah.
Just got a hit in Queens.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.259
Car we're looking for
went down a dead end street

17:23.346 --> 17:24.695
26 minutes ago.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.088
- OK, what then?
- Don't know.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.437
Hasn't reappeared yet.
- Keep looking.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.091
- OK.
- Queens.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.527
That's nowhere near
the Link's conference center.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.094
Well, it doesn't matter.
That's where the car is,

17:32.181 --> 17:34.357
which means Nathan and the bomb
may be nearby.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.751
Get OA and Nina over there.
- Yep.

17:43.192 --> 17:44.846
- That's our car.
- Heads up.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.196
There's someone in the
driver's side door.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.117
FBI.
Get out of the car.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.640
Hands where we can see them.

18:01.776 --> 18:04.257
All right,
hands behind your back.

18:10.393 --> 18:11.829
OK, where's Nathan?

18:11.916 --> 18:13.440
Who's Nathan?

18:16.443 --> 18:18.314
Ain't mine.
I found that.

18:18.401 --> 18:20.838
Don't play dumb and sit down.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.145
OK, pop the trunk.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.249
It's empty.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.077
Well, I didn't take
anything out of it.

18:42.164 --> 18:42.991
Where was the guy
that was driving?

18:43.078 --> 18:44.558
I don't know.

18:44.645 --> 18:45.080
He walked away about
20 minutes ago.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.473
And?

18:46.560 --> 18:48.779
He took a big duffel bag
out of the trunk.

18:48.866 --> 18:51.782
It looked heavy.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.567
That's our bomb.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.097
All right, folks,
NYPD has got a carjacking

19:02.184 --> 19:05.013
a block away from the location
of Nathan's abandoned vehicle.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.797
And the suspect fits
the description.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.321
Means he's feeling the heat.

19:08.408 --> 19:09.931
Ditched the car,
grabbed another,

19:10.018 --> 19:12.368
and he and the bomb are still
in the proverbial wind.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.892
So somebody please,
find me some eyes.

19:14.979 --> 19:16.459
- Got something.
- Yeah?

19:16.546 --> 19:17.895
Video from the parking lot
security camera

19:17.982 --> 19:18.548
that caught the carjacking.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.463
OK.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.944
Here we go. Here we go.
It's good angle.

19:25.773 --> 19:28.428
Uh-huh, the bomb's got
to be in that duffel.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.045
Does that car
he just took have GPS?

19:37.132 --> 19:38.916
No, it's too old.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.396
It's got to be good enough
for facial rec, right?

19:40.483 --> 19:41.876
- Checking now.
- Come on.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.008
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

19:46.794 --> 19:47.969
Yes, got a hit.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.362
All right, eyes up, people.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.233
Suspect's name
is Nathan Baker,

19:51.320 --> 19:53.061
34 year old
from Portland, Oregon.

19:53.148 --> 19:54.584
Been in and out of
psychiatric institutions

19:54.671 --> 19:56.673
most of his adult life.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.675
And currently wanted
for torching the home

19:58.762 --> 20:00.503
of Lawrence Howard,
Oregon State Chairman

20:00.590 --> 20:02.636
of the Republican
National Committee.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.812
So he's stepping up his game, escalating.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.205
Do we have any other video,

20:06.292 --> 20:07.641
know which direction
he's traveling?

20:07.728 --> 20:09.120
Just got a hit on
a traffic cam position

20:09.208 --> 20:10.383
near the Long Island Expressway.

20:10.470 --> 20:13.777
Shows a Black Nissan
heading east.

20:13.864 --> 20:15.997
OK, East on the LIE
means the original target

20:16.084 --> 20:17.607
is still in play.

20:17.694 --> 20:18.739
All right, let's alert
the agents we already have

20:18.826 --> 20:19.827
covering the building,
get the rest of the team

20:19.914 --> 20:21.742
over there ASAP.

20:21.829 --> 20:23.222
OK.

20:23.309 --> 20:27.617
But are we evacuating
the building?

20:27.704 --> 20:28.836
To hell with politics.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.316
He's heading east.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.361
His dead buddy told him
about the conference.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.409
Let's do it.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.498
OK.

20:38.585 --> 20:39.890
<i>Jubal, we have
boots on the ground.</i>

20:39.977 --> 20:41.501
<i>Initiating the search.</i>

20:46.897 --> 20:48.725
Hey, that's our car, right?

20:48.812 --> 20:50.379
Yep.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.908
- It's clear.
- Clear over here.

21:00.302 --> 21:01.260
Engine's still warm,
which means

21:01.347 --> 21:02.043
Nathan could be in the area.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.045
OK, cover me.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.187
It's empty.
- All right.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.711
Hey, guys, no bomb here,
which means

21:17.798 --> 21:19.495
he's either planted it
or he's in the process.

21:19.582 --> 21:22.542
Either way, we need to
evacuate the building ASAP.

21:22.629 --> 21:25.240
Please, please.
Thank you all for coming.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.373
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:27.460 --> 21:29.331
Special Agent Stuart Scola
with the FBI.

21:29.418 --> 21:30.898
There's nothing to panic about.

21:30.985 --> 21:33.727
But we need everyone
to proceed to the exits

21:33.814 --> 21:35.729
in an orderly fashion.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.905
Leave the building.
- Come on, you heard him.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.298
This is not a request.
It's not up for debate.

21:39.385 --> 21:40.516
Let's go.

21:40.603 --> 21:41.735
Leave your personal
belongings behind

21:41.822 --> 21:42.910
and head towards the exits.

21:42.997 --> 21:45.869
Up you go.
Let's go.

21:45.956 --> 21:47.828
OK. Jubal, we just sent you
the access codes.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.395
We need you guys
to tap into the camera feed

21:49.482 --> 21:50.744
here at the conference center.

21:50.831 --> 21:52.659
Elise, you got the feed?

21:52.746 --> 21:54.530
Yeah, there are
12 cameras in total.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.010
Looks like they
cover the entrance,

21:56.097 --> 21:57.925
exits, and stairwells.
- OK, good, good, good.

21:58.012 --> 21:59.709
We need you to scrub
the last 15 minutes.

21:59.796 --> 22:01.015
<i>Nathan could still be
wearing a gray hoodie</i>

22:01.102 --> 22:05.019
<i>and hopefully carrying
a black duffel bag.</i>

22:05.106 --> 22:08.196
Yeah, we're on it.

22:08.283 --> 22:09.719
Wait. Stop.
Right there.

22:09.806 --> 22:11.417
Yeah, yeah, there he is.
When was this?

22:11.504 --> 22:13.419
Timestamp says
15 minutes ago.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.899
OK, OA, he entered
stairwell three 15 minutes ago

22:15.986 --> 22:17.510
and headed downstairs.

22:17.597 --> 22:18.728
It appears he has
the bomb with him.

22:18.815 --> 22:20.208
Where is stairwell
number three?

22:20.295 --> 22:21.818
- West end of the building.
- OK.

22:21.905 --> 22:25.256
OK, Jubal, has Nathan left
that stairwell yet?

22:25.344 --> 22:26.780
I don't think we
have a basement feed.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.259
Do we have a basement feed?
- Nope.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.610
OK, fast-forward.

22:30.697 --> 22:32.699
Keep going.

22:32.786 --> 22:35.179
Keep going.

22:35.266 --> 22:39.706
Yeah, he leaves
five minutes later.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.186
And he does not have
the duffel bag on him,

22:42.273 --> 22:44.711
which means the bomb
is in place.

23:07.037 --> 23:10.911
Tiff?

23:10.998 --> 23:14.915
Jubal, we have eyes on
the black duffel bag.

23:15.002 --> 23:18.005
Come on.
Come on.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.417
How are we looking?

23:38.504 --> 23:42.246
Looks pretty straightforward.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.552
Should be able
to render it safe.

23:43.639 --> 23:44.814
Thank God.

23:44.901 --> 23:46.816
That timer is ticking down
real fast.

23:46.903 --> 23:48.949
Welcome to my world.

23:49.036 --> 23:50.951
Scola, be advised
we are in the process

23:51.038 --> 23:53.693
of disarming the bomb.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.782
Kelly, Elise,
having any luck finding Nathan?

23:55.869 --> 23:57.697
- Well, nothing so far.
- Yeah, me neither.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.659
Scola, you got eyes
on the suspect?

24:03.746 --> 24:04.921
Negative.
We're doing our best,

24:05.008 --> 24:07.750
but there's a lot of movement
right now.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.665
Look, he could be
taking advantage of this

24:09.752 --> 24:12.320
and blending in
with the evacuees.

24:20.937 --> 24:22.461
Hey, what's going on?

24:22.548 --> 24:23.984
<i>Hey, did you get the cake?</i>

24:24.071 --> 24:25.855
Not yet.

24:25.942 --> 24:27.727
I--I'll handle it.

24:27.814 --> 24:29.642
<i>OK, if you need me
to get it, just let me know</i>

24:29.729 --> 24:30.947
<i>and I'll go do it.</i>
- I'll handle it.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.296
I promise.
But I got to go.

24:32.383 --> 24:34.734
I'll see you tonight?

24:34.821 --> 24:37.650
Hey, Jubal, you OK?

24:37.737 --> 24:40.653
Yeah, yeah, no,
that was--it was nothing.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.437
I need you to head over
to Northport.

24:42.524 --> 24:43.394
I need you to oversee this.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.048
Yeah, of course, OK.

24:50.271 --> 24:52.142
Think I've got it.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.058
Wait, no.

24:55.145 --> 24:56.407
No what?

24:56.495 --> 24:57.670
Is there a problem?

24:57.757 --> 24:59.759
There is now.

24:59.846 --> 25:01.630
Looks like the guy who built
this anticipated someone

25:01.717 --> 25:05.808
trying to disarm it, added
some collapsing circuits.

25:05.895 --> 25:07.854
Meaning there's two different
ignition components.

25:07.941 --> 25:08.855
OK, and that's bad?

25:08.942 --> 25:10.073
You can't disarm both?

25:10.160 --> 25:11.466
I can.

25:11.553 --> 25:12.946
But not before that
timer hits zero.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.513
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.253
Evacuate.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.473
OK, so we move it to a place
with less damage potential.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.257
I wouldn't chance it.

25:20.344 --> 25:21.998
If a guy went through
that much effort,

25:22.085 --> 25:23.565
it's a good chance he put
a motion sensor in there,

25:23.652 --> 25:24.958
meaning once that timer
is initiated,

25:25.045 --> 25:27.395
any movement will cause
that thing to go off.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.444
Hey, Basur, are you
certain that that is part

25:33.532 --> 25:36.099
of the bomb's construction?

25:36.186 --> 25:38.319
No, but there's not
enough time to confirm

25:38.406 --> 25:39.973
that it does or doesn't.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.801
Look, I'm just going to
shoot this to you straight.

25:41.888 --> 25:45.674
We need to get clear of
this area, and I mean now.

25:51.419 --> 25:53.639
Scola, please tell me
the evacuation is complete.

25:53.726 --> 25:55.684
I think this bomb
is going to blow.

25:55.771 --> 25:56.598
<i>Negative, there
are still at least</i>

25:56.685 --> 25:59.122
<i>300 people on the third floor.</i>

26:24.844 --> 26:26.280
Why are you two
still in there?

26:26.367 --> 26:28.021
Clear the area now.

26:28.108 --> 26:29.718
Isobel, there is
no chance we can

26:29.805 --> 26:30.806
get everyone clear
of the blast radius

26:30.893 --> 26:32.460
before this thing goes off.

26:32.547 --> 26:34.462
OA, this is about
preservation of life now,

26:34.549 --> 26:36.420
<i>including your own.</i>

26:36.507 --> 26:37.813
Look, you heard her.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.946
We got to get out of here.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.861
OK.

26:44.037 --> 26:45.734
All the way down, this way.

26:45.821 --> 26:46.996
How many people are
left in the building?

26:47.083 --> 26:48.432
Too many.

26:48.519 --> 26:49.825
There's a wedding party
on the second floor.

26:49.912 --> 26:50.870
Isobel, please be
advised the evacuation

26:50.957 --> 26:51.914
is not going to be complete.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.176
<i>I am aware.</i>

26:53.263 --> 26:54.700
But we are out of options.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.484
Get the hell out of there now.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.268
That is an order.

27:01.663 --> 27:03.099
Yes, ma'am.

27:03.186 --> 27:05.928
Let's go.

27:06.015 --> 27:08.278
Tiff, pull my SUV up
to the nearest exit.

27:08.365 --> 27:09.932
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

27:10.019 --> 27:11.934
Look, you cannot
move that thing.

27:12.021 --> 27:14.110
What if it has a motion sensor?
- The bomb tech said there--

27:14.197 --> 27:15.851
Bomb tech said that
there is a chance.

27:15.938 --> 27:19.420
And if there's a chance,
I got to take it, OK?

27:19.507 --> 27:22.292
Please.

27:22.379 --> 27:24.164
Yeah.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.788
This way towards the exit, quickly.

27:56.936 --> 27:59.460
Come on, keep it moving,
quickly and calmly.

27:59.547 --> 28:00.591
There's a bomb?

28:00.679 --> 28:01.723
Ma'am, everything's OK.

28:01.810 --> 28:02.898
We have it under control.

28:02.985 --> 28:04.378
Please move towards the exit.

28:32.449 --> 28:33.668
Move.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.670
Move.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.628
All right, what are we doing?

28:37.716 --> 28:40.022
I am taking this to a place
with less damage potential.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.545
OK.

28:41.632 --> 28:43.156
You are staying here to help. Please.

28:43.243 --> 28:45.158
OA, no, I'm coming with you.

28:45.245 --> 28:46.507
Tiff, I'm the
senior agent here.

28:46.594 --> 28:47.377
We do not have time
to discuss this.

28:47.464 --> 28:49.336
I'm sorry.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.880
OA, drop that thing
on the side of the road

29:11.967 --> 29:13.664
and get the hell out of there.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.450
I'm not far enough away
from the building, Isobel.

29:16.537 --> 29:17.973
Get out of there.

29:21.847 --> 29:24.632
Get out of there!
That is an order!

29:58.840 --> 29:59.972
OA?

30:00.059 --> 30:02.061
OA, answer me.

30:05.716 --> 30:07.588
<i>OA, do you copy?</i>

30:12.767 --> 30:14.551
<i>Come on, OA, answer me.</i>

30:19.382 --> 30:20.731
I'm good.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.168
I'm OK.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.520
We still need to
find Nathan, though.

30:26.607 --> 30:28.870
You guys start searching.
I'm going to go pick up OA.

30:33.919 --> 30:34.920
What's up?

30:35.007 --> 30:36.747
That's Nathan.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.924
He ditched the black hoodie.

30:39.011 --> 30:40.708
That's him.

30:43.363 --> 30:45.104
We're in foot pursuit
of the suspect,

30:45.191 --> 30:47.323
heading south away
from the building.

30:52.502 --> 30:53.895
He burned us.

31:09.911 --> 31:11.478
FBI, freeze!

31:14.873 --> 31:16.178
We've got shots fired.

31:16.265 --> 31:18.006
We need an immediate containment.

31:22.358 --> 31:24.665
Suspect is a white male wearing
a green shirt and jeans.

31:27.276 --> 31:29.975
We're on scene.

31:30.062 --> 31:33.065
Nathan, drop the weapon!

31:34.936 --> 31:38.244
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:38.331 --> 31:40.463
- Drop the gun, Nathan.
- Listen to him, Nathan!

31:40.550 --> 31:42.378
There's nowhere to go.
- Whoa.

31:45.033 --> 31:46.339
Back off.

31:46.426 --> 31:48.645
Come any closer,
and I kill the kid.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.783
Get away.
I mean it.

31:55.870 --> 31:57.176
It's over, Nathan.

31:57.263 --> 31:59.265
He dies unless you walk away.

32:02.007 --> 32:03.965
Do it.
- Hey, listen, listen.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.185
You don't need to hurt the boy.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, please.

32:06.272 --> 32:07.186
Please, please don't do this.
- I mean it!

32:07.273 --> 32:08.709
All of you, back off!

32:25.291 --> 32:26.161
- Hey. What do you got?
- Hey.

32:26.248 --> 32:29.469
Hostage is white,
brown hair, 15 years old.

32:29.556 --> 32:30.731
Car was parked to the
right of that vehicle.

32:30.818 --> 32:31.906
They escaped this way.

32:31.993 --> 32:32.515
All right,
where's the father?

32:32.602 --> 32:33.821
Right here.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.344
- Sir?
- Yes?

32:35.431 --> 32:36.041
- Hey, Agent Valentine--
- Did you find him?

32:36.128 --> 32:37.651
Did you find Charlie?

32:37.738 --> 32:39.261
Not yet, but we have agents
surrounding the area.

32:39.348 --> 32:40.828
And we are confident they
have not left the vicinity.

32:40.915 --> 32:42.308
OK.
OK, good.

32:42.395 --> 32:43.918
So hopefully--

32:44.005 --> 32:45.615
I should have never brought him
to that conference.

32:45.702 --> 32:47.574
I just thought it would
be educational for him--

32:47.661 --> 32:49.576
This is not your fault.
I'm sure you were just trying

32:49.663 --> 32:51.360
to spend time with your son.

32:54.407 --> 32:56.583
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.628
But I need you to stay positive
and let us do our thing.

32:58.715 --> 33:00.152
We're going to do everything
we can to find Charlie

33:00.239 --> 33:01.588
and make sure nobody
hurts him, OK?

33:01.675 --> 33:02.719
Thank you.

33:02.806 --> 33:04.286
All right, stay put.

33:04.373 --> 33:05.548
Stay with my agent
in case we need you.

33:05.635 --> 33:08.595
OK.

33:08.682 --> 33:10.858
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

33:17.299 --> 33:18.605
Hey, Sam, Tyler just called me.

33:18.692 --> 33:20.389
Everything OK?

33:20.476 --> 33:22.087
Yeah, he's upset
because a couple of kids

33:22.174 --> 33:24.915
decided to go to the Mets game
instead of his birthday party.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.483
<i>Oh, OK.</i>

33:27.570 --> 33:29.398
OK, well, you can minimize it
if you want to.

33:29.485 --> 33:30.965
No, I'm not.
I'm not minimizing it.

33:31.052 --> 33:32.358
What are we going to do?

33:32.445 --> 33:33.794
The kids, they want to
go to the Mets game.

33:33.881 --> 33:37.667
He's having a really
hard time with it, Jubal.

33:37.754 --> 33:39.843
Yeah, I know Tyler
is having a tough time.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.932
You keep telling me.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.456
Look, I got to go.
I'm in the middle of something.

33:43.543 --> 33:44.718
I'll call you later.

33:47.329 --> 33:48.504
Hey, Isobel.
What's up?

33:48.591 --> 33:50.767
Hey, Suffolk County PD
found the suspect's car

33:50.854 --> 33:52.160
about a half a mile away.

33:52.247 --> 33:54.423
OK, that's good news.
Where?

33:54.510 --> 33:56.556
Oh, that's not far.
I'm on the way.

34:19.318 --> 34:21.537
We have eyes on the suspect?
- Not exactly.

34:21.624 --> 34:23.713
But we did find his vehicle
abandoned one block away.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.193
Containment is pretty tight.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.499
So the only place
he could possibly be

34:26.586 --> 34:28.414
is in that building.

34:28.501 --> 34:30.764
Right.

34:30.851 --> 34:32.331
Get down!
Get down!

34:36.900 --> 34:38.554
OA, call it in.

34:38.641 --> 34:39.773
We have shots fired.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.209
Suspect is held up
at the building

34:41.296 --> 34:43.516
at the corner of Waterford Way
and Mansfield.

34:43.603 --> 34:45.909
Shots fired.
Alpha team get in position.

34:47.563 --> 34:51.219
Nathan, this is
Agent Jubal Valentine, FBI.

34:51.306 --> 34:53.961
I'm here to help you.

34:54.048 --> 34:57.399
I want a car with bulletproof
glass in the next 15 minutes

34:57.486 --> 34:59.053
or the boy dies.

34:59.140 --> 35:00.446
We don't have a shot.

35:00.533 --> 35:03.536
OK, I think I can
make that happen.

35:03.623 --> 35:06.539
But first things first, you
need to release the hostage.

35:06.626 --> 35:09.368
His name is Charlie.
He's 15 years old.

35:09.455 --> 35:11.805
And he has nothing to do
with any of this.

35:11.892 --> 35:14.242
Once you do that, we can talk--
- I'm not letting anyone go.

35:14.329 --> 35:17.376
Just get me a car
or the boy dies.

35:19.595 --> 35:20.509
You sure this
building is contained?

35:20.596 --> 35:22.207
Yes, positive.

35:22.294 --> 35:22.946
All right, let's make sure
the snipers are in position,

35:23.033 --> 35:25.035
yeah?
- OK.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.602
Hey, Jubal.

35:26.689 --> 35:28.430
Yeah?

35:28.517 --> 35:30.345
There's a delivery door
in the back of the building.

35:30.432 --> 35:31.825
- Uh-huh.
- If you distract him,

35:31.912 --> 35:34.697
we can make entry there.

35:34.784 --> 35:37.831
Let's do it.

35:56.023 --> 35:57.198
Jubal, we're in position.

35:57.285 --> 35:59.592
All right, do your thing.

35:59.679 --> 36:01.898
Just keep him engaged.

36:23.529 --> 36:27.054
Nathan, it's me,
Agent Valentine.

36:27.141 --> 36:30.405
I'm unarmed.
I got no weapon here.

36:30.492 --> 36:34.844
I just want to talk this out,
me and you, OK?

36:34.931 --> 36:37.195
Now look, I'm going to need you
to release the kid.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.849
It's the only way I'm going
to be able to get you a car.

36:39.936 --> 36:42.504
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, easy, easy.

36:44.941 --> 36:46.726
I want to see the car.

36:46.813 --> 36:48.641
I'm not releasing him until--
until it's here,

36:48.728 --> 36:50.208
until I can see it
with my own eyes.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.558
OK, I can work with that.

36:52.645 --> 36:54.690
That's fine.
We're working on it.

36:54.777 --> 36:57.476
You should have an SUV
with bulletproof glass

36:57.563 --> 36:59.173
here in about--
about 20 minutes or so.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.566
I need it faster.

37:00.653 --> 37:02.481
Hey, man,
I'm doing the best I can.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.134
It's not easy to find
a bulletproof glass--

37:04.222 --> 37:05.048
I see a lot of cars
back there.

37:05.135 --> 37:06.093
Just give me one of those.

37:06.180 --> 37:07.877
Pull it around back and--

37:07.964 --> 37:09.792
OK, OK, yeah, that's fine.

37:09.879 --> 37:11.359
That's fine.

37:11.446 --> 37:12.447
Now, why don't you just
let Charlie go, all right?

37:12.534 --> 37:13.535
And we can--

37:13.622 --> 37:15.581
I just told you
I want a car now!

37:15.668 --> 37:17.147
So stop playing around
and make it happen,

37:17.235 --> 37:18.801
or I'm going to shoot this kid
in the head, I swear to God.

37:18.888 --> 37:19.846
Hey, hey, stop, stop.

37:19.933 --> 37:21.413
Hey, that is a bad idea.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.241
You do that, everybody loses.
Please, let me help you.

37:23.328 --> 37:24.981
Let me get you into a car or--

37:25.068 --> 37:26.896
you--you know what?

37:26.983 --> 37:28.202
Better yet, let me drive you.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.290
I'll take you wherever
you want to go.

37:29.377 --> 37:30.378
You want to go to the airport?

37:30.465 --> 37:31.814
You want to go to
the bus terminal?

37:31.901 --> 37:33.947
You name it.
- No, I don't want you.

37:34.034 --> 37:34.991
I want a car.

37:35.078 --> 37:35.992
Stop talking.

37:36.079 --> 37:37.603
Stop negotiating.

37:44.653 --> 37:46.699
Hey, hey.
Oh, Nathan.

37:46.786 --> 37:47.961
You're not thinking
this through.

37:48.048 --> 37:49.223
Listen to me.

37:49.310 --> 37:50.398
If I'm in the car,
nobody's going

37:50.485 --> 37:53.488
to do anything stupid, right?

37:53.575 --> 37:54.837
Right?

37:54.924 --> 37:55.534
It's a smart id--

37:57.797 --> 38:00.495
Come on. I got you.
You're okay. This way.

38:00.582 --> 38:01.757
You're okay.
- You're all right.

38:01.844 --> 38:03.324
Let's go over here.

38:10.940 --> 38:13.073
Right this way.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.596
Thank you so much.

38:14.683 --> 38:15.771
I don't even know
where to begin.

38:15.858 --> 38:17.512
I'm just glad your son is OK.
Here he is.

38:17.599 --> 38:19.862
- Oh, Charlie.
- Dad.

38:21.342 --> 38:24.650
Oh, Charlie. Oh, God.

38:24.737 --> 38:26.521
I'm so sorry.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.044
You okay?

38:29.785 --> 38:32.310
OK.

38:52.721 --> 38:54.854
Hello?

38:54.941 --> 38:56.159
Hey.

39:01.121 --> 39:02.165
I'm sorry, Sam.

39:02.252 --> 39:05.995
I--I got swept up in a case.

39:06.082 --> 39:08.389
A kid was taken hostage.

39:14.134 --> 39:15.265
How was the party?

39:15.353 --> 39:17.267
It was fine.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.835
How many kids showed up?

39:19.922 --> 39:21.097
Four.

39:21.184 --> 39:23.839
But they had fun.

39:23.926 --> 39:25.319
I think they did, anyway.

39:25.406 --> 39:28.278
Yeah, no, I'm sure they...

39:28.366 --> 39:30.890
Well, thanks for...

39:30.977 --> 39:35.198
not making me feel any worse
than I already feel.

39:40.073 --> 39:41.466
Ty upstairs?

39:41.553 --> 39:43.076
- Yeah.
- Mind if I say good night?

39:43.163 --> 39:44.338
Of course.

40:32.342 --> 40:34.388
I love you, buddy.
