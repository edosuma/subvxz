00:14.180 --> 00:16.433
[Alexa] I really wanted
to send Dylan the text,

00:16.516 --> 00:18.518
but I was also nervous.

00:18.601 --> 00:19.644
So I waited...

00:20.145 --> 00:21.438
and waited.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.314
Then ate dinner, slept, woke up,

00:23.398 --> 00:25.859
ate breakfast and waited some more.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.070
Send it! You said you liked him.

00:29.154 --> 00:32.115
I do! I...
But I-I'm just gonna wait to send it.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.491
-Sent.
-[message-sent tone]

00:34.951 --> 00:36.870
Your children will thank me.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.415
Oh, it went through! It went through!

00:40.498 --> 00:41.499
[both squealing]

00:41.583 --> 00:42.667
[laughter]

00:43.251 --> 00:44.127
[both gasp]

00:44.210 --> 00:45.754
Why hasn't he gotten back to me?

00:46.546 --> 00:48.798
-I see dots! He's writing back!
-There's dots!

00:48.882 --> 00:49.924
[both squealing]

00:50.008 --> 00:50.884
[both gasp]

00:50.967 --> 00:52.635
And they went away.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.804
You know what? Who cares?

00:54.888 --> 00:57.849
I put myself out there. If he doesn't
text back, then that's totally...

00:57.932 --> 00:59.350
[yells] The dots are back!

00:59.434 --> 01:00.518
[both squealing]

01:00.602 --> 01:02.395
Hey, what's going on, huh?

01:02.479 --> 01:05.732
Alexa texted Dylan to ask if he still
wants to go to the dance with her.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.442
Ooh! What did he say?

01:08.234 --> 01:09.069
Still waiting.

01:09.652 --> 01:10.612
Oh, wait. I see dots!

01:10.695 --> 01:12.530
Ah, don't get too excited.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.032
We've seen dots before.

01:15.366 --> 01:18.078
-Oh, he's gonna say yes!
-Of course he'll say yes!

01:18.578 --> 01:21.289
If this is about getting surround sound,
I am doing the research.

01:21.372 --> 01:22.373
[Lori chuckles]

01:22.457 --> 01:25.251
No. Dylan. Winter Formal.
Waiting for a response.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.294
Ooh!

01:28.755 --> 01:30.465
-[cell phone chimes]
-He said yes!

01:30.548 --> 01:31.966
[all cheer]

01:33.134 --> 01:35.011
Oh, yes!

01:35.094 --> 01:36.095
Whoo!

01:36.179 --> 01:37.847
Awesome!

01:37.931 --> 01:40.058
Yeah! What are we talking about?

01:40.809 --> 01:43.186
Dylan said yes to going
to Winter Formal with your sister.

01:46.022 --> 01:47.065

01:47.148 --> 01:48.274

new ice skates and a Dalmatian.

02:26.437 --> 02:29.440
-A Dalmatian?
-Santa said he couldn't promise that.

02:29.524 --> 02:32.569
Well, Santa can't always bring you
everything you want.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.988
Yeah, he just said
it would be some kind of puppy.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.325
Oh, Santa.

02:39.909 --> 02:40.827
[Jennifer sighs]

02:40.910 --> 02:43.663
Well, you know how Santa and I
always talk on the phone

02:43.746 --> 02:45.540
before Christmas Eve every year?

02:45.623 --> 02:48.126
I'm just gonna have to let him know
that it won't be this year.

02:48.710 --> 02:49.669
Why not?

02:49.752 --> 02:53.298
I love dogs,
but puppies need full-time care.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.466
Who's gonna watch a dog
while you're at school?

02:56.259 --> 02:57.427
I understand.

02:58.052 --> 02:59.178
I'll quit school.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.223
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.850
One day, I promise.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.729
Why do you take her phone calls, Santa?

03:18.573 --> 03:19.741
[cat purring]

03:19.824 --> 03:20.867
Whoa!

03:20.950 --> 03:22.243
Are you for me?

03:23.202 --> 03:24.203
You are.

03:26.581 --> 03:29.626
Thanks, Santa!
It's not a dog, but close enough.

03:34.005 --> 03:37.342
I'm not allowed to have you,
so we need to keep you secret from my mom.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.220
I'll hide you next door.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.723
You're gonna like it here, Secret Kitty.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.226
They keep their heat running
the whole night.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.324
I'll keep you in here
while I go find some food.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.117
Do you like Fruit Roll-Ups?

04:04.285 --> 04:05.703
Well, that's all I have.

[knocking]

04:20.843 --> 04:22.220
Hi, Dylan.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.763
Um... Hi.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.016
Hey, man! What's up?
I was just about to text you.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.309
You want to play Overwatch?

04:28.393 --> 04:30.895
I can totally play
because I cleaned my room.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.231
[mouths] No, I didn't.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.066
Oh, actually I'm here for Alexa.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.151
Alexa? Why?

04:37.235 --> 04:39.779
We realized we don't hang out
besides our tutoring sessions.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.533
-Hey.
-Hi.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.868
-Hi.
-Hey.

04:47.787 --> 04:48.788
Hey.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.709
-Oh. You want to go to Wired?
-Sure.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.377
Dylan, you read my mind.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.963
I was just thinking of going to Wired.
We'll all go together.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.674
Great.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.351
So, how is your dancing?

05:10.435 --> 05:13.563
Incredible. And if you don't believe me,
you can ask my Aunt Nancy.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.981
Hm. Has she seen you dance?

05:15.064 --> 05:16.566
No, but she'll lie for me.

05:18.109 --> 05:21.362
Boring!
You know what's not boring? Laser tag!

05:21.446 --> 05:22.447
Pew! Pew! Pew!

05:22.989 --> 05:24.073
I'll be right back.

05:25.074 --> 05:27.827
You know I mean with me?
Alexa doesn't even like laser tag.

05:27.910 --> 05:28.911
Pew.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.749
-Thank God you're here.
-Yeah, I got your text.

05:32.832 --> 05:36.210
Ten frowny faces and a coffee cup?
What's so urgent?

05:36.294 --> 05:37.920
I need you to distract Lucas.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.505
I'm trying to get to know Dylan,

05:39.589 --> 05:42.925
but so far all I've learned is that he has
a really clingy friend named Lucas.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.262
-Can you please sit with him?
-Sure.

05:46.345 --> 05:47.930
-Thanks, Katie.
-Yeah.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.934
Hey! Look who's here - Katie.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.063
Lucas, Katie has a question for you.
Katie, sit.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.147
Dylan?

05:59.901 --> 06:01.736
Here we are.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.030
Poor Dylan. I should go save him.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.239
Wait!

06:05.323 --> 06:07.784
I have a question for you.

06:08.242 --> 06:09.077
Yeah?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.255
-No.
-No?

06:21.339 --> 06:23.424
I have another question.

06:25.343 --> 06:28.221
Do you...

06:29.388 --> 06:30.848
know...

06:32.183 --> 06:33.851
So, this is my dress for the dance.

06:35.269 --> 06:37.355
-You can't wear that dress.
-Why not?

06:37.438 --> 06:39.107
Because that's the dress I'm wearing.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.734
[Dylan groans]

06:41.818 --> 06:44.695
Must be such a relief you don't
have to pretend I'm not funny any more.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.532
OK, I just have to ask.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.368
Why did you say no at first?

06:52.120 --> 06:53.704
I-I was worried that...

06:56.165 --> 06:57.291
Nothing. Never mind.

06:57.375 --> 07:00.294
You know, we're going
and it's gonna be great.

07:00.378 --> 07:04.215
Yeah. It's nice we finally get to spend
time together, not thinking about math.

07:04.298 --> 07:07.552
Yeah. But, come on,
you're thinking about math.

07:07.635 --> 07:08.636
Maybe a little.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.348
But in my defense, I have
a mathlete competition tomorrow night.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.059
Also, in my defense,
that sounded cooler in my head.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.146
Hey, dude. Let's go bowling.

07:18.229 --> 07:21.983
Uh... Actually, I was thinking
we could kind of stay here and talk.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.067
All right.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.611
Oh, hey, I've got a question for you guys.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.614
Could I pull off boat shoes?

07:28.698 --> 07:31.659
I met this guy in the mall and he told me
I could wear boat shoes on land...

07:34.787 --> 07:35.621
Bless you.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.082
Oh, hey, sweetie.

07:38.666 --> 07:39.959
Oh.

07:40.042 --> 07:41.335
Hi, guys.

07:42.378 --> 07:44.255
-Do you need something?
-No.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.257
Yes. No.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.343
OK. Um...

07:51.721 --> 07:53.973
Um...
Honey, I-I think you're getting sick.

07:54.056 --> 07:57.768
It's got to be allergies. I only get
like this when I'm around a cat.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.732
Right, right. You never get sick.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.108
It has to be a cat.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.319
[Dave laughs] It has to be.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.653
I know my bod--

08:09.655 --> 08:13.993
OK. Honey, we can't risk Alexa's health.
You know she can't get sick.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.330
I'll see if I can stay at the Coopers',
but I am not sick.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.582
Thank you. I'll bring over some soup.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.210
And I'll bring over your stuff.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.170
And you're leaving.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.256
Oh, honey, I feel so bad for you.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.466
I'm not si--

08:28.549 --> 08:29.926
OK.

08:33.012 --> 08:34.013
I love you!

08:37.058 --> 08:40.770
-Thanks for letting me stay here, Jen.
-Mm. Four years of stealing your Wi-Fi...

08:41.354 --> 08:42.480
I think you've earned it.

08:42.563 --> 08:43.773
[door opens]

08:43.856 --> 08:48.152
Hey. So, I brought our patient some food
and a little medication. How's he doing?

08:48.236 --> 08:50.446
Looks good to me. He should go home.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.823
I'm not sick.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.367
It's that darn invisible cat?

08:54.450 --> 08:56.035
It followed you over here?

08:56.118 --> 08:59.247
All right. Thanks, Jen. Feel better.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.415
Come on, invisible kitty. [chuckles]

09:01.499 --> 09:02.959
Ooh! You're heavy.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.128
[door closes]

09:06.212 --> 09:07.296
Dinner's ready, Jack.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.592
-Isn't that Dave's?
-Oh, he's half asleep.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.011
-Plus, you never get brie.
-Ooh!

09:14.595 --> 09:15.429
I'm not asleep.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.597
Shh-shh-shh.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.682
Rest now.

He texted me "good night" last night.

09:26.274 --> 09:29.068
-N-I-T-E?
-N-I-G-H-T.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.611
Whoa!

09:30.695 --> 09:31.988
What? What does it mean?

09:32.071 --> 09:34.824
What doesn't it mean? It's so romantic!

09:36.242 --> 09:38.119
Oh, well, speaking of romantic,

09:38.202 --> 09:39.328
there's Ryan.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.330
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.000
I still feel bad
about the other night.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.626
What should I say?

09:46.335 --> 09:47.336
Alexa?

09:49.839 --> 09:50.840
[Ryan chuckles]

09:50.923 --> 09:52.258
Oh, um...

09:52.341 --> 09:53.342
Hi, Ryan.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.012
So, look, about the other night. I--

09:56.095 --> 09:59.473
Yeah, I heard some guy showed up
at your door with a marching band.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.517
-That's random.
-[laughs]

10:02.560 --> 10:03.853
No. No, it was um--

10:03.936 --> 10:06.564
It was random. It was random. I'm sorry.

10:06.647 --> 10:09.859
My friend said I had to do something crazy
to ask you to the dance.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.028
I'm just glad
the fireworks never went off.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.113
Oh! Yeah, well, you know, that's OK,

10:14.196 --> 10:17.241
because I'm more of
a skywriting kind of girl.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.035
Oh, that was my biggest mistake.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.119
Mm.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.456
Anyway, I just...
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.083
Don't. Don't be sorry.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.252
It was um... It was really sweet.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.591
Uh... I should go.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.594
But I'll see you later, Coopie Katie.
Katie Cooper.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.220
Yeah, I got it right.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.098
Um... Bye.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.277
[sighs] This is great.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.780
Just you and me, a couple of bros,

10:55.863 --> 10:57.657
sitting around, eating lunch.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.741
[Lucas sighs]

10:58.824 --> 10:59.950
I've missed us.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.411
Dude, it's been one day.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.996
One long day.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.582
Oh, hey, check this YouTube out.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.626
[both laugh]

11:08.709 --> 11:10.670
-That's so stupid!
-So stupid.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.004
-Let's watch it again.
-Yeah.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.631
Alexa! Hey, catch you later, man.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.217
Oh, but you'll miss the part
where he pukes into the fan!

11:17.676 --> 11:18.677
Seriously?

11:18.761 --> 11:19.804
Hey, Alexa.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.306
So, are we seeing each other
after school today?

11:22.390 --> 11:23.307
Yeah.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.642
I'm just wondering,

11:24.725 --> 11:27.561
is it a tutoring session
or are we hanging out?

11:27.645 --> 11:29.772
Because your mother pays me either way.

11:30.898 --> 11:34.026
Well, since we didn't really get
to hang out yesterday, let's...

11:34.735 --> 11:35.736
hang out.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.406
Great. Let's hang out.

11:41.575 --> 11:43.077
-All right?
-[chuckles] Yeah.

11:44.912 --> 11:47.081
-Alexa!
-What?

11:47.164 --> 11:49.708
Dylan and I were in the middle
of watching a super-cool video.

11:49.792 --> 11:50.835
So?

11:50.918 --> 11:52.044
So, you took him away!

11:52.128 --> 11:54.380
Bookmark it and show him later, weirdo.

11:54.463 --> 11:57.842
This makes me wish
Lizzie Delmonico had said yes.

11:58.092 --> 11:58.926
What?

11:59.009 --> 12:01.303
Dylan asked her to the dance
after he asked you.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.306
-You didn't know?
-No.

12:04.890 --> 12:08.018
Well, I did. I'm his best friend,
and I know everything about him.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.523
Whose Dylan is he now?

12:13.023 --> 12:14.150
My Dylan.

12:14.817 --> 12:15.818
Not you, Dylan.

12:22.741 --> 12:25.786
[congested] Lori, I'm not sick.
I can fly this plane.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.752
Who let you in the cockpit?

12:35.713 --> 12:36.630
[Dave groans]

12:38.507 --> 12:39.508
Lori!

12:40.301 --> 12:41.886
-Cat!
-It's not a cat!

12:43.471 --> 12:46.098
-You are dreaming.
-I am?

12:46.182 --> 12:47.433
Yes.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.560
[whispers] Go back to sleep.

12:50.394 --> 12:51.228
Right.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.315
What were you thinking, Secret Kitty?

12:55.691 --> 12:57.109
Ladies and gentlemen...

12:57.735 --> 13:00.446
we are now starting our descent
into Memphis.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.200
I mean, Lizzie's in his grade

13:04.283 --> 13:06.243
a-and she has two classes with him.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.411
It makes sense.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.205
I knew he didn't really like me.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.958
I mean, how long did he wait after he
ran out and asked Lizzie Delmonico, huh?

13:13.042 --> 13:14.794
-Or it could be--
-Exactly!

13:14.877 --> 13:16.212
-Honey, I don't think--
-Yes!

13:16.295 --> 13:19.381
I mean, I-I knew he asked me
out of sympathy.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.883
I mean, when I said no,

13:20.966 --> 13:23.469
he was off the hook to ask the girl
he really wanted to, right?

13:23.552 --> 13:25.513
-No, I don't think so.
-Right.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.934
Honey, I just don't think
you're being very rational right now.

13:30.017 --> 13:32.102
Mom, no offense,

13:32.186 --> 13:34.146
but you don't know
what it's like to be a girl!

13:36.565 --> 13:37.399
[knocking]

13:37.483 --> 13:39.944
Oh! That's his phony knock now.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.197
Hi, Dylan.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.115
Hi, Mrs. Mendoza.

13:46.867 --> 13:47.993
What's up, Katie?

13:49.161 --> 13:50.663
-What's up?
-Hi.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.792
Oh, I can't watch this.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.211
Yeah, me neither. [chuckles]

13:57.836 --> 13:59.088
[door opens]

14:00.506 --> 14:01.507
[door closes]

14:02.216 --> 14:03.551
Sorry I'm late.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.178
I was practicing with the team
for tonight's competition.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.265
-But I'm ready to hang.
-Actually, this is a tutoring session.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.433
Oh.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.518
OK.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.271
Oh!

14:16.313 --> 14:19.733
You got an A-minus on your exam?
Have you actually been learning from me?

14:19.817 --> 14:21.861
-Want something to drink?
-Sure. Lemonade.

14:21.944 --> 14:26.073
Oh, but if I don't have lemonade, I'm sure
you have a backup choice ready to go?

14:26.657 --> 14:27.867
Uh... Water's fine.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.243
Hm.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.327
I see.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.246
So you asked for lemonade

14:32.329 --> 14:35.165
because you thought
it was the right thing to do,

14:35.249 --> 14:37.543
but really, you wanted water.

14:40.087 --> 14:41.005
What's going on?

14:41.088 --> 14:42.256
Lizzie...

14:42.756 --> 14:43.757
Delmonico.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.927
-What?
-You asked her to the Winter Formal.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.431
-So?
-You asked me to the Winter Formal.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.724
Yeah, and you said no.

14:52.975 --> 14:57.521
So you have a problem with me
asking Lizzie after you rejected me?

14:57.855 --> 14:58.856
Yes.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.649
Alexa, that makes no sense.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.652
I'm not a math problem, OK?
I don't have to make sense.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.362
But I do.

15:07.615 --> 15:11.452
You clearly don't like me if you
were ready to go and ask somebody else.

15:11.535 --> 15:14.330
That's not true.
And she said no, by the way.

15:15.497 --> 15:16.498
Smart girl.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.627
Really?

15:19.710 --> 15:21.211
Well... you know what, Alexa?

15:21.295 --> 15:23.589
If you don't want to go
to the Winter Formal with me,

15:23.672 --> 15:24.757
you don't have to.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.009
Well, maybe I shouldn't.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.512
OK.

15:32.723 --> 15:33.724
OK.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.769
-Now, can we please get to work?
-Fine.

15:39.313 --> 15:42.691
Just uh... do those first ten problems
and I'll check them.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.152
-I will.
-Good.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.236
Good.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.093
So, how's it going in here?

16:10.636 --> 16:11.971
Great.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.765
So, now I'm gonna see
how it's going upstairs.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.441
[sighs] Alexa and Dylan are done?

16:25.025 --> 16:25.859
Finally!

16:26.402 --> 16:28.612
They're making everything
so awkward for me.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.202
-Mom?
-Oh, sorry.

16:35.953 --> 16:39.206
Alexa's in the tree with Katie.
I was just making sure she was OK.

16:39.790 --> 16:43.711
-OK about what?
-Well, she and Dylan had a fight.

16:43.794 --> 16:47.381
Someone told her that he had asked another
girl to the dance. Now they're not going.

16:47.464 --> 16:48.590
Really?

16:48.674 --> 16:50.259
Yeah. What jerk would say that?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.678
I don't know.
Maybe this jerk had his reasons.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.055
Or her reasons.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.642
Lucas! Why would you say such a thing?

16:58.726 --> 17:00.936
There are so many guys she could go with.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.689
I just don't understand
why she has to go with my best friend.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.482
Yeah? Well, they are.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.817
Or, they were.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.028
Look, the point is your sister is upset.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.697
Come on. I'm sure it's not that bad.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.408
And no offense, Mom - you don't know
what it's like to be a girl.

17:17.161 --> 17:20.122
Lucas, Alexa is really upset.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.291
Oh.

17:23.292 --> 17:24.501
Well, now I feel bad.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.795
Well, that's a good start.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.845
I can't see anything!

17:36.805 --> 17:38.849
Oh, what the heck?
I'm getting in the sink!

17:38.932 --> 17:40.225
[grunts]

17:44.772 --> 17:46.565
So you're not going to the dance?

17:46.648 --> 17:48.525
H-He really called it off?

17:48.609 --> 17:51.403
Or I did. I can't even remember.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.739
Dylan!

17:53.822 --> 17:56.867
With your stupid, cute, stupid face.

17:58.118 --> 18:01.997
I don't... I don't want to side
with Stupid, Cute, Stupid Face...

18:03.332 --> 18:04.500
but you did say no.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.376
He should have known how I was feeling.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.587
Well, you didn't know
how you were feeling.

18:09.171 --> 18:12.091
He was being a total jerk with his,
"Hi, Mrs. Mendoza,"

18:12.174 --> 18:15.594
and drinking his water, and leaving
his arm there when our arms touched

18:15.677 --> 18:17.346
and telling me I didn't make sense.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.889
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

18:19.431 --> 18:20.724
There was arm-touching?

18:22.017 --> 18:22.851
Yeah.

18:23.811 --> 18:24.812
Show me!

18:25.729 --> 18:29.942
Look, I have watched 22 Christmas
Hallmark movies since Thanksgiving,

18:30.025 --> 18:32.444
so I think I know what this means.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.529
Show me.

18:34.696 --> 18:35.697
OK.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.749
-OK, Alexa, that--
-There's more.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.964
Then my mom walked in.

18:52.047 --> 18:53.298
OK, OK.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.134
So...

18:55.717 --> 18:58.303
So after you chewed him out,
he still stayed,

18:58.387 --> 19:01.181
and you had
this electric arm-touch moment?

19:01.723 --> 19:04.893
Alexa, who cares about Lizzie Delmonico?

19:05.435 --> 19:07.437
He doesn't feel sorry for you.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.566
Just accept the fact that he likes you.

19:12.734 --> 19:15.320
-He does, doesn't he?
-Yes!

19:15.404 --> 19:17.823
I know and I like him, too!

19:17.906 --> 19:20.200
Did I totally screw this up?

19:20.784 --> 19:21.785
Yes.

19:22.327 --> 19:26.582
But if I learned anything from
the ending of Christmas In Your Arms,

19:26.665 --> 19:28.542
it's that it is never too late to fix it.

19:29.126 --> 19:32.921
Especially if you're trying to make
a go of it on your grandpa's ranch.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.341
[stammers] Let's do this!

19:36.925 --> 19:37.801
Now!

19:39.011 --> 19:41.722
But he's at his mathlete competition.
Maybe I should just wait--

19:41.805 --> 19:43.265
No! Now!

19:43.348 --> 19:44.474
Go big!

19:45.434 --> 19:46.727
-I'm going big!
-Yeah!

19:47.895 --> 19:49.897
And I'm bringing tissues!

19:52.566 --> 19:54.359
-Alexa--
-Can you drive us to school?

19:54.943 --> 19:57.738
No. I need to tell you something.
I'm sorry for what I said.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.824
I was just thinking about losing a friend
and not about you.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.826
Thanks. Yeah, we're good.
Drive us to school.

20:05.078 --> 20:08.665
No. Giving you a ride to school isn't
enough. I want to help you find Dylan.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.876
Dylan's at school! Drive us to school!

20:10.959 --> 20:13.212
Then why are you standing there? Let's go!

20:14.421 --> 20:18.091
This is just like the ending of
Mistletoe For Margaret.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.384
I love that one!

20:24.348 --> 20:26.391
Junk. Junk.

20:26.892 --> 20:30.103
Ooh! All-day breakfast sandwiches?

20:30.187 --> 20:31.813
I'll see you all day tomorrow.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.696
"Lost cat"?

20:41.698 --> 20:42.783
Jack!

20:44.701 --> 20:45.535
Yeah, Mom?

20:45.619 --> 20:49.498
Why did you put these "lost cat" fliers
in our recycling?

20:50.082 --> 20:52.251
Because they're made of paper

20:52.334 --> 20:54.002
and you taught me to recycle.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.214
Are you hiding a cat in our house?

20:57.798 --> 20:58.924
That's crazy.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.219
-Are you hiding a cat in this house?
-That's crazy.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.516
If you don't tell me,
I'm gonna find it myself.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.227
-Dave, wake up.
-I'm not sick!

21:12.312 --> 21:13.313
What are you doing?

21:13.397 --> 21:15.440
Jack is hiding a cat
and we're gonna find it.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.526
A cat? I knew it!

21:18.026 --> 21:19.319
Ooh, warmer.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.404
[Dave groans]

21:22.281 --> 21:23.282
Colder.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.784
Ooh, warm.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.203
Warmer.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.664
Oh, red hot!

21:30.747 --> 21:34.042
My eyes are burning
and my throat's closing up!

21:35.377 --> 21:36.295
Yes!

21:36.878 --> 21:38.672
That can only mean one thing.

21:39.423 --> 21:40.966
-[cat meows]
-[Dave groans]

21:42.843 --> 21:44.761
-Jack!
-I'm sorry, Mom.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.889
I just wanted a pet so bad
and the cat came along.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.767
I thought it was an early gift from Santa.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.395
Why would Santa give you the Murphys' cat?

21:53.478 --> 21:55.731
I was confused, too.

21:57.024 --> 22:00.527
We're taking this cat back
and you're apologizing to the Murphys.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.487
Not yet! I've got to show Lori!

22:06.199 --> 22:07.826
Lori, I'm not...

22:09.703 --> 22:10.537
...sick!

22:10.620 --> 22:11.455
I told you!

22:12.039 --> 22:12.956
A cat!

22:13.040 --> 22:14.249
[sneezes]

22:14.333 --> 22:15.334
[groans]

22:19.504 --> 22:21.965
Kennedy, you're out of time.
I need an answer.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.050
Uh...

22:24.259 --> 22:27.095
-Forty-two-point-seven?
-I'm sorry, that is incorrect.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.472
The point goes to Crawford.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.098
[applause]

22:30.182 --> 22:32.642
Come on, Dylan. Focus.
That was an easy one.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.437
I know. I'm sorry. It's just, Alexa, she--

22:35.520 --> 22:36.813
Again with Alexa?

22:36.897 --> 22:39.399
This is like pi - it never ends.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.194
Oh, he's a mess.

22:42.778 --> 22:43.862
I'm doing this.

22:44.654 --> 22:45.822
Go big.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.493
The next question is a toss-up
for both teams.

22:49.576 --> 22:50.410
[Alexa] Hi.

22:50.494 --> 22:54.998
Excuse me, Mr. Bradford? I'd like to offer
up the next question for the competition.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.084
That's not how this works.

22:57.667 --> 22:58.752
Thanks. Um...

23:00.295 --> 23:01.963
My question is for Kennedy High.

23:02.506 --> 23:05.425
Specifically, for the cute one
in the glasses.

23:09.137 --> 23:10.347
My question is for Dylan.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.016
Dylan.

23:14.810 --> 23:15.811
[whispers] OK.

23:16.394 --> 23:20.232
Student A and Student D have spent
11 weeks studying math together...

23:21.066 --> 23:24.361
but Student A has been
a total jerk to Student D

23:24.444 --> 23:28.448
because she was scared Student D
only asked her to the Winter Formal

23:28.532 --> 23:30.033
because he felt sorry for her.

23:32.035 --> 23:33.328
Knowing this information...

23:34.830 --> 23:40.085
what's the probability
Student D accepts Student A's apology

23:40.168 --> 23:44.089
and also accepts her invitation
to be her date to the Winter Formal?

23:44.172 --> 23:45.132
[bell dings]

23:45.715 --> 23:48.260
Trick question.
There isn't enough information to--

23:48.343 --> 23:49.344
[bell dings]

23:50.220 --> 23:51.263
One hundred percent.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.349
The probability is 100%.

23:54.432 --> 23:55.559
And I can prove it.

23:56.351 --> 23:59.437
Student D would never pity Student A.

24:00.522 --> 24:03.942
She's the toughest, funniest...

24:04.526 --> 24:07.112
coolest, sometimes scariest girl he knows.

24:08.822 --> 24:11.783
And Student D really likes Student A...

24:13.160 --> 24:14.661
for exactly who she is.

24:17.747 --> 24:19.958
This has been so romantic...

24:20.792 --> 24:22.836
but we should really get back
to the competition.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.755
Thank you. Yeah, I-I'm done.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.383
Math away.

24:33.471 --> 24:35.640
OK. I guess we can share him.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.564
Merry Christmas, everybody!

24:43.148 --> 24:44.566
OK. OK, let's go.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.526
But it felt like it needed an ending.
