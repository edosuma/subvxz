00:04.904 --> 00:06.840
Previously on Heels ...

00:06.940 --> 00:08.908
Violence sometimes
suggests a deeper issue

00:09.009 --> 00:10.543
going on with a child.

00:10.643 --> 00:12.579
It's a miracle we got
out of that meeting

00:12.679 --> 00:14.914
with them agreeing to let
Thomas back in school.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.183
They wanted us to acknowledge
punching as wrong.

00:17.283 --> 00:18.618
Punching isn't always wrong.

00:18.718 --> 00:19.933
Mr. Jack Spade!

00:21.621 --> 00:23.089
I'm sorry to burden
you with this.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.724
You're my friend,
not a burden.

00:24.724 --> 00:26.526
You can stay here
as long as you want.

00:26.626 --> 00:29.129
My name is Crystal Tyler.

00:29.229 --> 00:30.997
And I am the baddest...

00:32.732 --> 00:33.633
...bitch...

00:35.068 --> 00:37.070
...the DWL has ever seen.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.371
- Crystal!
- Yeah!

00:38.471 --> 00:40.507
Congrats again, superstar.

00:43.476 --> 00:45.258
- So why are you here?
- Ace?

00:45.378 --> 00:47.147
Suits from up north
sent me to scout him.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.015
He's not gonna leave
what we're building.

00:49.115 --> 00:50.450
I've been calling Ace
since last night.

00:50.550 --> 00:51.918
He's gone.

00:52.018 --> 00:53.086
I'd like the
restroom key, please.

00:53.186 --> 00:55.989
Got to buy something.
I got Coke, Cherry Coke.

00:56.089 --> 00:57.757
Stick them all
up your ass, sir.

00:57.857 --> 00:59.359
Let me buy you a meal, partner.

00:59.459 --> 01:01.307
Go find some other runaway
to make s'mores with.

01:01.428 --> 01:03.396
If you're hiking
and camping Dover Springs,

01:03.496 --> 01:05.031
- I hope you're all geared up.
- I was just gonna wear these.

01:05.131 --> 01:06.232
You're gonna hike
in soccer shoes?

01:06.332 --> 01:08.134
It's pretty rough terrain.

01:10.336 --> 01:12.038

02:50.803 --> 02:52.205
Eddie Earl's coming to
dinner to maybe invest

02:52.305 --> 02:53.940
in Daddy's wrestling league.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.975
This cake is our way
of saying "please."

02:56.075 --> 02:58.778
"Please" sounds better
with cake.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.080
I got a good feeling
about this.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.949
Great.

03:03.049 --> 03:05.185
Hope your good feelings
turn into money.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.191
You stole a piece of cake.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.026
- No, I didn't.
- Don't be sinning

03:13.126 --> 03:13.927
twice at once--
stealing and lying.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.395
Move it.

03:15.495 --> 03:17.163
You said I could have a piece.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.132
After Eddie had his!
Pants down!

03:19.232 --> 03:20.400
I'm sorry, Mommy.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.635
Too late for sorry.
Pants down!

03:27.807 --> 03:30.109
Aah!

03:32.212 --> 03:33.580
The hell's going on?

03:33.680 --> 03:35.114
He stole a piece
of cake, then lied!

03:35.215 --> 03:37.016
I won't be mother to a liar.

03:37.116 --> 03:38.651
Eddie's due any second, Carol!

03:39.319 --> 03:40.553
You're unreal.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.757
Aah!

03:44.757 --> 03:46.492
You got
the sponsorship, Tom!

03:46.593 --> 03:48.361
This is gonna be great
for the whole town of Duffy.

03:48.461 --> 03:49.963
It's the start of
something great, Eddie.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.568
Eddie Earl's
giving us some money!

03:55.668 --> 03:57.403
Daddy is so happy.

04:00.506 --> 04:05.044
Now, Jack, a mommy's job is
to show her son how to behave.

04:05.144 --> 04:06.746
"Chasten thy son
while there is hope,

04:06.846 --> 04:08.982
and let not thy soul
spare for his crying."

04:09.082 --> 04:10.917
Proverbs 19:18.

04:11.017 --> 04:13.987
You became a better
person today.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.756
I'll get some cream
for your boo-boos.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.130
Thirty-six
hours of steady rainfall

04:24.230 --> 04:26.432
have left many homeless
in the Metro area,

04:26.532 --> 04:28.067
knee-deep in flood waters.

04:29.836 --> 04:31.104
Put my phone down.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.805
You gonna use the
landline till I find Ace.

04:32.905 --> 04:35.174
Ace don't wanna be found.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.543
This is Dad's belt.

04:37.644 --> 04:41.881
And I wear it sometimes
to remind me to not be you.

04:41.981 --> 04:46.819
I been thinking a lot
about you, how you behaved.

04:46.919 --> 04:48.321
Well, boo-hoo.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.323
Now, give me my phone.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.325
Ace needs to be left alone.

04:52.425 --> 04:54.794
You don't know what Ace
needs any more than I do.

04:54.894 --> 04:57.697
Know this though--if me and
Ace end up killing each other,

04:57.697 --> 04:59.999
you will have played
a big part in why.

05:34.033 --> 05:34.934
Ohh...

05:35.034 --> 05:36.669
Oh--ah!

05:36.769 --> 05:37.904
Ah...

05:46.379 --> 05:48.581
Ah--ah! Shit.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.281
Aah--

06:08.401 --> 06:11.270
ohh... fuck!

06:12.772 --> 06:14.240
One more.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.042
I can't.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.111
I disagree.
Come on.

06:23.449 --> 06:25.017
Here we go.

06:25.118 --> 06:28.301
Push. Come on.

06:28.421 --> 06:30.123
- Uhh--
- Yes!

06:30.223 --> 06:32.325
- Nice.
- Okay.

06:35.461 --> 06:36.963
- Look great.
- Yeah. Thanks for

06:36.963 --> 06:39.165
pushing me to dig deep.

06:39.265 --> 06:42.869
In that case, one more set.

06:42.969 --> 06:44.804
I--ha.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.945
You're a good son, Deandre,
buying me this bed.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.415
Too generous.

06:55.515 --> 06:58.050
Oh, look, Pops, now that
I'm the champ at Dystopia,

06:58.151 --> 07:00.032
I make this in a day.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.855
Yeah. I worry about you
in that car crash wrestling

07:02.955 --> 07:04.757
they do at Dystopia.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.360
You'd never catch
Rocky Johnson

07:07.460 --> 07:09.962
using barbed wire
to beat a man.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.698
- Do it with his bare hands.
- Ha ha. Look, Pops.

07:12.799 --> 07:14.901
I got this.
Look, I'm gonna go work out.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.602
Now, you text me if you
invite a lady over here

07:16.702 --> 07:18.204
to break in your new bed.

07:18.304 --> 07:20.206
I'ma need the heads up.

07:20.306 --> 07:22.308
- Okay.
- Okay?

07:22.408 --> 07:24.343
- All right, son.
- All right, now listen.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.213
I know how loud you can get.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.092
Let's rip this fart together.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.894
Hell yeah.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.898
The time has finally come.

07:45.998 --> 07:48.601
He's one of the greatest to
ever step between the ropes,

07:48.701 --> 07:52.071
three-time World Champion,
six-time Tag Team Champion,

07:52.171 --> 07:54.974
the only man to wrestle
three different species

07:55.074 --> 07:56.275
and defeat two of them.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.978
It's the "Wild Bill Hancock"
podcast!

07:59.078 --> 08:00.713
Diego Cottonmouth here,

08:00.813 --> 08:03.282
your masked menace luchador, producing.

08:03.382 --> 08:05.017
Bill, you said
you wanted to cover

08:05.117 --> 08:06.786
not just wrestling, but life.

08:06.886 --> 08:10.323
You want each episode to be
wide-ranging and estranging.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.291
Diego, my goal
is to use the truth

08:12.391 --> 08:14.327
to offend as many people
as I can.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.929
So, look,
lots to discuss,

08:17.029 --> 08:19.332
but your fans
got tons of questions,

08:19.432 --> 08:21.267
and they're gonna fast forward
until they get the answers.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.202
So let's talk DWL first.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.004
Folks have had difficulty

08:25.104 --> 08:27.740
following all the swerves
at the DWL lately--

08:27.840 --> 08:30.576
Uh, Crystal defeating
both you and Jack Spade.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.879
Defeat's a dubious conclusion.

08:32.979 --> 08:34.280
Well, she has the belt.
You do not.

08:34.380 --> 08:35.581
Is that not a defeat?

08:35.681 --> 08:37.216
A setback is not a defeat.

08:37.316 --> 08:38.684
Uh-huh.

08:38.784 --> 08:41.721
Now, Crystal,
in her rise to DWL champ,

08:41.821 --> 08:45.024
had stints as Ace Spade
and Bobby Pin's valet.

08:45.124 --> 08:46.592
Correct.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.929
But she re-enlisted as your
valet, Bunny Bombshell.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.998
I saved that lassie
from the swamp.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.200
But the moment I was in
need of the very services

08:54.300 --> 08:55.902
a valet renders,

08:56.002 --> 08:58.004
she forgot
everything I'd done for her.

08:58.104 --> 09:01.274
The only reason she can
hang with the big boys

09:01.374 --> 09:03.309
is 'cause I taught
Crystal Tyler

09:03.409 --> 09:05.111
everything she knows!

09:05.211 --> 09:07.780
Now she's proving herself
worthy to learn the rest of it

09:07.880 --> 09:09.782
in the opposing
corner of the ring.

09:09.782 --> 09:13.085
I don't care if you're a man,
woman, or alien species.

09:13.185 --> 09:15.621
You step through those ropes
and cross The Bill,

09:15.721 --> 09:17.523
you're gonna get the horns.
Life is long.

09:17.623 --> 09:18.991
Yessir.

09:19.091 --> 09:20.459
Tell us what occurred
at the State Fair

09:20.560 --> 09:21.727
with Charlie Gully then.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.296
My sense of honor occurred!

09:23.396 --> 09:25.565
Gully crashed our event.
I took umbrage.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.266
Yeah. Y-you claimed

09:27.366 --> 09:30.636
you had a bout of, uh,
involuntary digestive distress.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.572
I've stated facts.

09:32.672 --> 09:35.141
God created the sphincter
so that shitting, by design,

09:35.241 --> 09:36.776
would be voluntary.

09:36.876 --> 09:38.678
The sphincter's a goddamn
damper for the rectum.

09:38.778 --> 09:41.013
Asses don't leak
unless they're poisoned!

09:41.113 --> 09:42.782
Yet, despite that,
you swallowed your shame

09:42.882 --> 09:44.350
in pursuit of the belt.

09:44.450 --> 09:46.352
I'm a competitor first,
gentleman second.

09:46.452 --> 09:49.702
Charlie Gully attempted to
disrupt an athletic contest.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.124
Once I discovered
I had some...

09:52.224 --> 09:55.027
accidental excrement pooled
in the seat of my pants,

09:55.127 --> 09:56.362
I made use of it.

09:56.462 --> 09:58.531
You threw a clothesline.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.566
And then
I shit-stamped his face.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.702
It was as if fate herself proclaimed,

10:02.802 --> 10:05.251
"Here is a man
you'd like to eat shit

10:05.371 --> 10:07.773
presenting his mouth
as a fortuitous receptacle."

10:07.873 --> 10:09.275
Boom!

10:09.375 --> 10:11.477
Lemons into lemonade, kids.

10:11.577 --> 10:13.145
Whoo!

10:22.989 --> 10:24.156
Hey, I'm gonna grab
some Egg McMuffins.

10:24.256 --> 10:25.358
You want one?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.692
- No.
- How about for Jack?

10:26.792 --> 10:28.928
- Jack's outta town.
- Till when?

10:29.028 --> 10:31.797
We gotta promote the next show.
Did he give you a script?

10:31.897 --> 10:33.666
No.
Just said I was "in charge."

10:33.766 --> 10:35.534
Holy shit!
Was he stoned?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.103
Wait, you're in charge?

10:37.203 --> 10:39.505
Yay! Girl power!

10:39.605 --> 10:41.140
I gotta focus.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.109
A McGriddle 'n' sausage?

10:43.209 --> 10:45.111
Go.

10:55.054 --> 10:58.024
Watch that one there.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.495
- Next leg!
- Hey!

11:02.595 --> 11:05.331
Hey!

11:05.431 --> 11:07.533
Shit! You okay?!

11:07.633 --> 11:08.834
Sprained my ankle.

11:08.934 --> 11:10.983
You got another line
you can toss down?

11:11.103 --> 11:12.772
- Janice!
- What?!

11:12.872 --> 11:14.473
There's a guy down here!

11:14.573 --> 11:15.808
Says he might have
broke his ankle.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.810
I'll call in a rescue chopper.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.046
No, no, I said I sprained it!
I-it's just a sprain.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.081
A sprain can be
worse than a break.

11:22.181 --> 11:25.351
Can you just let me try
to climb up, please?

11:25.451 --> 11:27.653
All right, Janice,
no chopper this time.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.488
Just drop down
another harness.

11:29.588 --> 11:32.224
Let's help this guy out.

11:32.324 --> 11:34.694
So I was thinking we do
a backstage interview,

11:34.794 --> 11:36.095
a medical update on Wild Bill

11:36.195 --> 11:37.563
after Crystal
kicked him into oblivion.

11:37.663 --> 11:39.031
Bill cuts a promo.

11:39.131 --> 11:40.966
- Shifts the blame to the crowd.
- I love it.

11:41.067 --> 11:43.869
We should make Bobby our
backstage roving reporter.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.305
His leg's still
healing but he's so--

11:46.405 --> 11:47.506
Stiff and robotic.

11:47.606 --> 11:48.674
Done.

11:48.774 --> 11:50.876
So Bobby gets Bill's reaction

11:50.976 --> 11:52.244
to all that went down
last week.

11:52.344 --> 11:54.480
Crystal won is what went down.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.215
Yes, she did.

11:56.315 --> 11:58.084
So, Bill tells the crowd
how tough you are,

11:58.184 --> 12:00.586
but then he calls you
a piece of shit

12:00.686 --> 12:02.354
so that he can bring it
all back around later,

12:02.455 --> 12:04.423
saying, "All that nice stuff
I said about you before

12:04.523 --> 12:05.491
"is just gonna
make beating your ass

12:05.591 --> 12:06.592
all the more sweet!"

12:06.692 --> 12:07.993
Perfect.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.462
And you don't need
to give me my due.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.663
I took it!

12:10.763 --> 12:12.531
It's going in.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.102
Hey.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.671
Willie,
is Ace doing all right?

12:18.771 --> 12:20.106
Right now, Ace is just a
blinking dot

12:20.206 --> 12:21.807
on his mother's phone
somewhere not here.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.110
Could be two towns over,
could be Tallahassee.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.045
The only thing
that Jack suggested

12:26.145 --> 12:28.514
was that we start off with
your championship celebration.

12:28.614 --> 12:30.316
So I'm thinking
you come out on the mic,

12:30.316 --> 12:32.384
you know, "Pound for pound,
I'm the best wrestler there is

12:32.485 --> 12:34.720
"in the DWL, and I'm on top

12:34.820 --> 12:36.856
because you all
believed in me!"

12:36.956 --> 12:38.671
Really make the crowd
feel part of it.

12:38.791 --> 12:40.593
Y'all have taken me this far,

12:40.693 --> 12:43.562
and it's gon' be
one hell of a ride

12:43.662 --> 12:45.264
seeing where we go
from here...

12:45.264 --> 12:47.399
- Together.
- Exactly!

12:47.500 --> 12:49.401
You're the antithesis of Bill,
but we don't wanna see

12:49.502 --> 12:51.003
the two of you
mixing it up again

12:51.103 --> 12:53.305
until we string the story
out further.

12:53.405 --> 12:56.308
So instead, we have The Dad
interrupting on the mic,

12:56.408 --> 12:58.177
you know, as a sort
of surrogate for Bill,

12:58.277 --> 13:00.012
complaining about a woman
holding a man's title,

13:00.112 --> 13:01.180
blah, blah.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.548
Wait, The Dad?

13:02.648 --> 13:04.717
He's... he's so nice.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.218
- Dad's a douche.
- Oh, really?

13:06.318 --> 13:07.119
I didn't know that.

13:07.219 --> 13:08.954
In the story.
Keep up, kid.

13:09.054 --> 13:11.724
I'm sorry.
You said it so emphatically.

13:11.824 --> 13:12.958
I've got no idea what
he's like in real life.

13:13.058 --> 13:15.060
I should probably find out
if he's even a real dad.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.729
Ha. Okay.

13:16.829 --> 13:19.865
Maybe The Dad says
some shit like,

13:19.965 --> 13:23.569
"You're welcome to become 'The
Stepmom' and do my laundry."

13:23.669 --> 13:24.837
Shit, now I hate The Dad.

13:24.937 --> 13:26.438
Now I wanna see
you beat his ass.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.774
Well, why not just whoop his
ass right then and there?

13:28.874 --> 13:31.577
- Why wait?
- Roses for Crystal,

13:31.677 --> 13:33.646
the new champ, left outside.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.247
"Secret Admirer."

13:35.347 --> 13:37.583
What?

13:37.683 --> 13:40.686
These are the first
flowers for me ever.

13:40.786 --> 13:42.721
Just know
that Secret Admirer

13:42.822 --> 13:44.824
might also be
a secret serial killer.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.594
Oh, uh, Jack left Willie
in charge.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.563
I know.
So great, right?

13:50.663 --> 13:52.044
Girl power!

13:52.164 --> 13:53.098
- Girl power!
- Please stop saying that.

13:53.199 --> 13:54.900
Girl power!

13:55.000 --> 13:57.750
Hear there's a new
El Jefe in the house!

13:57.850 --> 14:00.606
Hey! La Jefa!
Wilheminia !

14:00.706 --> 14:02.741
Great. Jack's just taking
some days off.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.744
Bill, did you just
call Willie a heifer?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.113
La Jefa is The Boss
in Spanish, Debbie.

14:08.214 --> 14:09.515
Crystal, you gotta
check the 'Gram.

14:09.615 --> 14:11.497
You're getting
marriage proposals.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.686
Roses too.
Secret admirers.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.154
Okay.
Here's what I'm thinking--

14:15.254 --> 14:17.623
Will, two secs.
Gotta send a text.

14:17.723 --> 14:19.225
I don't care, Paula,

14:19.325 --> 14:22.228
whether it's cash,
comma, Bitcoin, comma,

14:22.328 --> 14:24.396
or doubloons, comma--
get me paid.

14:24.496 --> 14:25.698
And send.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.867
Thank you.
Carry on.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.236
Okay. So we're gonna kick it
off with a celebration

14:30.336 --> 14:32.238
of Crystal's championship--
- Willie, sorry.

14:32.338 --> 14:33.639
What is a doubloon?

14:33.739 --> 14:35.174
Ancient Spanish currency.

14:35.274 --> 14:37.343
How ancient, like back when
they bankrolled Columbus?

14:37.443 --> 14:38.878
Guys.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.012
Columbus
was a genocidal assassin

14:40.112 --> 14:41.714
hired by racist Spaniards.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.015
They're called Conquistadors,

14:43.115 --> 14:44.650
and they learned
that from the Romans.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.151
So, Bill's backstage.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.120
- Bobby, now you're a reporter.
- Cool. Yeah, use me

14:48.220 --> 14:49.722
- how you need me.
- Ooh, Bobby's

14:49.822 --> 14:51.957
a "free use" guy, folks!

14:52.057 --> 14:53.559
Hey, hey!
Got a surprise.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.127
Follow me!

14:55.227 --> 14:56.695
If it's his dick
in a hotdog bun,

14:56.795 --> 14:58.230
I'm grabbing
and not letting go.

15:07.539 --> 15:09.241
- Dad!
- Hey, there's my buddy!

15:09.341 --> 15:10.276
How you doing?

15:10.376 --> 15:11.343
Where'd you go, Dad?

15:11.443 --> 15:13.412
I...

15:13.512 --> 15:15.080
I-I just been at home.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.783
I miss you.
Can you come get me?

15:17.883 --> 15:19.752
Y-yessir. Yessir.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.620
I just gotta do
a little something first.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.188
Won't be long though.

15:23.289 --> 15:24.957
Could you put your mother
on the phone for a second?

15:25.057 --> 15:26.358
She's on a run.

15:26.458 --> 15:29.628
Dad, when can I
come back to school?

15:29.728 --> 15:32.878
We-we met with the school.
You're no longer suspended.

15:32.998 --> 15:34.600
Mommy said
they hadn't decided yet.

15:38.203 --> 15:40.739
I will call your Mom to
clarify--we'll-we'll fix it.

15:40.839 --> 15:41.807
Okay, Dad. Thanks.

15:41.907 --> 15:43.309
I love you.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.244
Love you too, buddy.
You stay positive.

15:53.052 --> 15:54.653
- Whoa!
- Whoo!

15:58.490 --> 16:01.460
Yeah, look at that, dude.
That looks awesome.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.629
Surprise!

16:03.729 --> 16:05.664
- I kept the secret.
- You did!

16:05.664 --> 16:06.665
Man, imagine
"Call of Duty" on this.

16:06.765 --> 16:08.801
No, no, no. "Mario Kart."

16:08.801 --> 16:10.402
- I call Toad.
- Oh, I call Diddy Kong, so...

16:10.502 --> 16:12.618
Diddy Kong hasn't been in
"Mario Kart" since the Wii.

16:12.738 --> 16:13.739
Yeah, did not know that.

16:13.839 --> 16:15.140
Too generous, Eddie.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.142
Hell yeah.
You can watch vignettes,

16:17.142 --> 16:19.211
backstage stuff, interviews.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.814
Totally. Okay, okay.
Back to work, folks!

16:21.914 --> 16:23.048
We can also have movie nights.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.516
Oh, show 'em the features, honey.

16:24.616 --> 16:26.885
No. Why don't we set that
tutorial up for later?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.087
Oh, no, no.
You're gonna love this.

16:28.187 --> 16:30.102
You're gonna wanna see
what this can do.

16:30.222 --> 16:31.991
We gotta over what the plan is.
Everyone please shut up!

16:32.091 --> 16:33.993
Sorry, Annie,
it's just...

16:34.093 --> 16:35.307
We should have called first.

16:35.427 --> 16:36.929
I am so sorry.

16:37.029 --> 16:39.031
Jack left Willie in charge.

16:39.131 --> 16:41.367
Oh, well, isn't
that just wonderful?

16:41.467 --> 16:42.968
Everything is great.

16:42.968 --> 16:44.169
Just, you know, as usual,
there's a lot to do.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.005
So thank you for this.
We'll put it to good use.

16:46.105 --> 16:47.606
We're so grateful.

16:47.706 --> 16:49.008
Everyone, start warming up.

16:49.108 --> 16:52.611
Bill, may I speak to you
privately for a minute?

16:52.611 --> 16:54.179
Jack is gone. Ace is gone.

16:54.279 --> 16:55.995
I need you to be
ring general out there,

16:56.115 --> 16:57.950
not number one Jackass on the
Jackass Most Wanted List.

16:58.050 --> 16:59.385
Help me keep the group focused.

16:59.485 --> 17:00.986
Coach 'em up.
Keep 'em disciplined.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.988
- Got it?
- Aye, aye, Kommandant.

17:03.088 --> 17:05.257
Give a jangle if you
need a sounding board.

17:07.926 --> 17:09.361
Okay.

17:09.461 --> 17:12.531
Good and generous, Earl family.

17:12.631 --> 17:14.199
You must excuse us.

17:14.299 --> 17:16.068
We gotta whip this unit
into a shape

17:16.168 --> 17:18.370
worthy enough
to be on your big screen TV.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.205
Uh, it- it's actually a
video wall.

17:20.305 --> 17:22.274
Jim, it appears
your life philosophy

17:22.374 --> 17:24.009
is to wait till someone
says something,

17:24.109 --> 17:25.778
then make them feel
stupid for saying it.

17:28.814 --> 17:30.382
I'm just trying to
tell the truth,

17:30.482 --> 17:32.217
even if it offends someone,
Bill!

17:32.317 --> 17:34.720
Ooh, my bro listened
to our podcast.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.422
All right, well, we'll let
y'all get to work, kids.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.624
Okay. How about a round
of applause...

17:38.724 --> 17:41.060
- Yes.
- ...for Eddie and Annie.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.362
Whoo!

17:43.462 --> 17:47.166
Okay, Crystal,
and Jim the Giant Jesuit,

17:47.266 --> 17:48.467
you're up first.
Into the ring.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.670
How much did that cost?
I won't tell anybody.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.386
Bro, 46 people
including Big Jim

17:54.506 --> 17:55.841
have already
streamed the podcast!

17:55.941 --> 17:57.509
That's so cool, man.
You deserve it.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.611
Thanks, man.
Yeah, I'm telling you, man,

17:59.711 --> 18:01.647
they gotta start listening
to my ideas around here.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.715
I'm gonna get some graphics
templates for this video wall

18:03.816 --> 18:05.250
up our game.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.319
I can help bring this place
to whole new level, bro.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.954
I- I hope they listen to you, man.

18:09.054 --> 18:11.790
- Your genius is untapped.
- Ha ha ha. Yes, it is.

18:11.890 --> 18:14.927
Oh!

18:15.027 --> 18:16.829
Don't worry.
You got two of 'em.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.031
D, hey, uh...

18:19.131 --> 18:21.333
when Crystal
kissed me at the fair...

18:21.333 --> 18:22.968
- Mm-hmm.
- ...what do you think

18:23.068 --> 18:24.670
- that meant?
- Didn't see it.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.738
- She tongue you?
- No.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.574
Did she suck on your lip?

18:28.674 --> 18:30.409
Like, you know, kinda
clamping down for a second,

18:30.509 --> 18:33.145
then pulling back and making
a very faint popping sound?

18:33.245 --> 18:35.314
- No.
- Did she lean onto your thigh

18:35.414 --> 18:36.949
and kinda, you know,
linger there,

18:37.049 --> 18:38.917
perching her
entire bodyweight onto you,

18:39.017 --> 18:41.553
centering it with her crotch?

18:41.653 --> 18:44.990
No, it did not happen in the
way that you just described.

18:45.090 --> 18:46.705
Based on all that, no clue.

18:46.825 --> 18:48.894
Ask her what the kiss meant.

18:48.994 --> 18:51.130
How in the heck am I supposed
to ask a question like that?

18:51.230 --> 18:52.778
Well, you just asked me
a question like that.

18:52.898 --> 18:54.533
Ask her the same question.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.402
Bro, she's getting marriage
proposals and flowers

18:57.503 --> 19:00.372
and she's hot as shit
and also very, very cool.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.508
- Mm-hmm.
- It's a miracle she's single.

19:02.608 --> 19:03.842
Make your move.

19:03.842 --> 19:05.457
Her lips have at least
touched yours.

19:05.577 --> 19:07.246
It was a kiss on the lips, right?

19:07.346 --> 19:08.380
Don't be fucking
telling me it was

19:08.480 --> 19:10.048
on the forehead or on your cheek.

19:10.048 --> 19:11.049
Oh, no, no, no.
Lips were involved.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.518
Hers and mine.

19:12.618 --> 19:15.220
Ha ha ha.
Make your intentions known.

19:15.220 --> 19:18.357
If you whiff, on to the next.

19:20.859 --> 19:22.794
- Uhh!
- Good. Knee.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.235
Great. Here we go.

19:31.870 --> 19:33.172
- Whoo!
- Oh!

19:33.272 --> 19:36.074
Yeah!

19:36.175 --> 19:38.243
That is how we do it.

19:39.711 --> 19:41.160
Wow.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.195
Your Volvo needs an alignment.

19:58.263 --> 19:59.531
I still can't
believe you survived.

19:59.631 --> 20:01.833
I know how to fall.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.835
I was a wrestler.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.305
Professional wrestler.

20:07.472 --> 20:09.074
Ice every 15 minutes.

20:09.174 --> 20:11.276
And next hike, leave
the soccer shoes behind.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.711
Just get yourself
some Merrells.

20:12.811 --> 20:14.446
They got 52 million styles.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.715
But don't get cute
and buy their clogs.

20:16.815 --> 20:20.052
Clogs are only good
for getting the mail.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.853
Hey.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.236
Stay a little longer.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.093
We can get high.
Fool around.

20:28.193 --> 20:29.995
All of us.

20:30.095 --> 20:31.697
He must be concussed.

20:33.632 --> 20:35.300
I thought y'all were being nice
'cause you wanted to hook up.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.436
Come on, buddy!
Read the room!

20:37.536 --> 20:39.605
Pal, if you interpret being
nice as an invitation to fuck,

20:39.605 --> 20:41.907
you don't know what
being nice looks like.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.712
I misinterpreted the situation.

20:46.812 --> 20:48.113
Yes, you did.

20:48.213 --> 20:50.782
Damn. Be better.

20:55.954 --> 20:57.656
Charlie Gully
attempted to disrupt

20:57.756 --> 20:59.391
an athletic contest.

20:59.491 --> 21:02.594
Once I discovered I had
some... accidental excrement

21:02.694 --> 21:06.231
pooled in the seat of my
pants, I made use of it.

21:06.331 --> 21:08.166
You threw a clothesline.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.701
And then
I shit-stamped his face.

21:09.801 --> 21:11.737
It was as if fate her--

21:11.837 --> 21:13.105
One second, Pop.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.179
Hey, it's Charlie.
Leave a message.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.314
Gully, it's Rooster.

21:22.414 --> 21:24.316
We need to meet up.

21:24.416 --> 21:27.286
Someone is talking
shit about you.

22:05.123 --> 22:06.758
Fuck!

22:06.758 --> 22:07.926
Aah!

22:08.026 --> 22:10.429
Gah--ohh! Ow!

22:10.529 --> 22:14.333
Ah! Ah!

22:17.736 --> 22:21.006
Anytime you want to switch
beds, Love, just let me know.

22:21.106 --> 22:23.642
I like the air kind.

22:23.742 --> 22:24.743
Dad called
while you were running.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.179
He said I can
go back to school.

22:27.279 --> 22:28.714
Oh.

22:28.714 --> 22:30.716
Maybe the school
finished their paperwork.

22:30.816 --> 22:32.484
He said he was home
all this time.

22:32.584 --> 22:34.553
You said he was on a trip.

22:34.653 --> 22:36.455
Well, he must have
come back early.

22:38.256 --> 22:39.891
Are you and Dad
getting divorced?

22:42.194 --> 22:43.261
I want to be home.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.863
It's okay, love.

22:44.963 --> 22:46.264
It's not.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.633
You said he was on a trip.
You lied.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.649
You're not a good mommy
to keep me away from him.

22:50.769 --> 22:52.037
Hey.

22:52.137 --> 22:54.573
Mister, sit yourself
up right now.

22:54.673 --> 22:56.508
You will not say that to Mommy!

22:56.608 --> 22:58.577
You have no idea what
it is to be a mommy!

22:58.677 --> 23:01.446
You can't just say those words
and not have them hurt me.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.215
And you can't say them
thinking they will hurt me

23:03.315 --> 23:04.282
and expect me
to just sit here and take it.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.751
You understand?

23:05.851 --> 23:07.085
I'm sorry, Mommy.

23:07.185 --> 23:08.987
I don't wanna be mean.
I'm just sad.

23:09.087 --> 23:10.489
I miss Daddy.

23:10.589 --> 23:12.791
I miss him so much.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.270
Hey, y'all.

23:25.370 --> 23:27.853
Everything okay?

23:50.562 --> 23:52.330
You did
a good job with this script.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.532
It's all over the place.

23:53.632 --> 23:54.666
It's real good.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.768
Can't be great
in the first draft.

23:56.868 --> 23:59.137
Jack left you in charge
'cause he trusts you won't

23:59.237 --> 24:00.839
completely fuck it up
like I might.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.507
Don't shit on it
or I'll have to tackle you.

24:02.607 --> 24:04.810
That'd be
a bad thing?

24:05.710 --> 24:06.978
Uh no, I gotta focus.

24:07.078 --> 24:09.181
So The Dad ragdolls Crystal
through the table.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.515
She'll sell it well.
Like it.

24:10.615 --> 24:11.950
We just can't
book some bullshit

24:12.050 --> 24:13.351
where she gets to
glow-up without getting

24:13.452 --> 24:14.686
her ass kicked sometimes.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.087
Jack and I thought
the same thing.

24:16.188 --> 24:17.355
Keep her down on the farm

24:17.456 --> 24:18.623
so she's got adversity
to overcome.

24:18.723 --> 24:20.459
That's what they're
paying to see.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.260
Narrative wise, when women
conquer a man's world,

24:22.360 --> 24:23.628
men don't exactly roll over.

24:23.728 --> 24:25.497
No, they go back hard.

24:25.597 --> 24:28.033
But that's what she wanted,
right, to win the belt?

24:28.133 --> 24:31.269
Man had the belt, so to win
the belt she had to fight men.

24:31.369 --> 24:32.537
Whether she deserves
it or not,

24:32.637 --> 24:33.605
she's gotta get her face
pushed in a few times.

24:33.705 --> 24:35.640
What do you mean "whether
she deserves it or not"?

24:35.740 --> 24:37.542
Can't say she deserves
to get her face pushed in.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.344
If you get in a boxing ring,

24:39.444 --> 24:41.813
do you deserve
or not deserve to get punched?

24:41.913 --> 24:43.682
Are we saying Crystal
was unaware

24:43.782 --> 24:46.318
of the pitfalls
of her pursuits?

24:46.418 --> 24:47.886
Okay.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.120
So The Dad ragdolls
Crystal through the table.

24:49.221 --> 24:50.856
She's out cold. It's brutal.

24:50.956 --> 24:52.457
But then she stirs.

24:52.557 --> 24:53.525
She needs to sell
the pain to the crowd.

24:53.625 --> 24:55.460
Hit all the "-izes."

24:55.560 --> 24:58.797
Let them empathize and realize
and Crystalize her pain.

24:58.897 --> 24:59.831
Okay.

25:01.967 --> 25:04.202
Hey.
I'm working on the next card.

25:04.302 --> 25:05.770
Wow,
you're working late, huh?

25:05.871 --> 25:07.739
How long you think you'll be?

25:07.839 --> 25:09.341
I don't know.
Jack left me in charge.

25:09.441 --> 25:10.175
I gotta figure it all out--
the card,

25:10.275 --> 25:11.376
the stories, all of it.

25:11.476 --> 25:12.577
Jack's letting you
book matches now?

25:12.677 --> 25:15.013
Believe me, I know.

25:15.113 --> 25:17.182
Well, Robin needs
help writing an essay.

25:17.282 --> 25:18.717
I guess you're the helper.

25:18.817 --> 25:20.719
Ted, if it makes you
feel better,

25:20.819 --> 25:22.454
Willie's cooking up probably
one of the best shows

25:22.554 --> 25:23.755
we've ever done.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.323
Hello, Bill.

25:25.423 --> 25:27.392
She's working us all
into overtime, Tedly.

25:27.492 --> 25:30.395
But when the material's
good, you don't mind.

25:30.495 --> 25:31.997
Uh-huh.

25:32.097 --> 25:34.566
Well, I'll let you two go.

25:41.072 --> 25:43.174
"But then she stirs..."

25:53.251 --> 25:55.587
Come home, please.

25:55.687 --> 25:58.390
How the fuck you find me?

25:58.490 --> 26:01.426
"Find my Phone" app
on Mom's phone.

26:01.526 --> 26:03.128
Mom's tracking me?

26:03.228 --> 26:05.597
You share locations.

26:07.599 --> 26:09.467
You're still in
the family plan.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.703
When I die and go to hell,
first thing I'm gonna do

26:11.803 --> 26:14.606
is find Steve Jobs and
beat the fuck outta him.

26:14.606 --> 26:16.107
I hope that's not true.

26:16.207 --> 26:18.009
For you or Steve Jobs.

26:18.109 --> 26:21.713
Unless he was... unless he was
mean to his cats or something.

26:28.119 --> 26:29.654
You look kinda banged up.

26:29.754 --> 26:32.591
You're looking
kinda "fuck you."

26:34.025 --> 26:35.560
Never again.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.365
Just opted out of
Family Sharing.

26:40.465 --> 26:42.033
Now fuck off.

26:43.068 --> 26:46.518
I was hoping that I was gonna
have you at "come home."

26:46.638 --> 26:48.840
Fuck off's just the tip
of the icicle-dick, Jack.

26:48.940 --> 26:51.576
Fuck you with
a massive icicle-dick.

26:55.714 --> 26:57.315
- You should call housekeeping.
- You should fuck off.

26:57.415 --> 26:59.684
With an icicle-dick.
I heard you.

27:02.821 --> 27:04.956
Was the room this trashed
when you checked in?

27:05.056 --> 27:06.725
Nope. Had a bash.

27:06.825 --> 27:08.526
Been meeting some great
people across the U.S. of A.!

27:08.627 --> 27:10.095
Cool.

27:13.932 --> 27:16.234
I got some cash on hand
from our last gate receipts.

27:16.334 --> 27:18.870
Figured that if you're gonna be
gone for good, you'd need it.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.473
Stealing from
the DWL bank now, huh?

27:21.573 --> 27:22.974
It's hard to steal
from what's ours.

27:23.074 --> 27:25.577
Don't say ours.
You made me think it was ours.

27:25.677 --> 27:28.179
It's yours.
Dad bequeathed the DWL to you.

27:28.279 --> 27:30.482
- Because he wanted me cursed.
- Well, cursed my ass.

27:30.582 --> 27:31.916
I seen the buzz
building with Crystal.

27:32.017 --> 27:33.818
Without me.

27:33.918 --> 27:35.787
DWL's taking off
like you always dreamt.

27:35.887 --> 27:37.555
Yet my brother's
in a Mississippi motel room

27:37.656 --> 27:39.324
and my wife's near left me.

27:39.424 --> 27:40.959
Maybe you should
ask yourself why.

27:41.059 --> 27:42.260
What the fuck do you
think led me here!

27:42.360 --> 27:44.596
Mom's phone.

27:46.798 --> 27:49.668
I'm here, hat in hand,

27:49.768 --> 27:51.302
because
I have been thinking about it.

27:51.403 --> 27:52.570
About how to get sympathy.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.439
About my brother.

27:54.539 --> 27:56.274
About how my actions

27:56.374 --> 27:58.176
have affected you

27:58.276 --> 27:59.878
and Staci and Thomas.

27:59.978 --> 28:02.781
"Dear old brother Ace," blah.

28:02.781 --> 28:07.185
"Wife and son," blah.

28:07.285 --> 28:09.654
Heard it all before, Jack!

28:09.754 --> 28:10.955
This is not going
how I expected.

28:11.056 --> 28:12.724
'Cause you're not scripting it.

28:12.824 --> 28:14.359
I'm not just gonna say

28:14.459 --> 28:15.427
- what you want me to.
- I kno--

28:15.527 --> 28:16.661
I know all that.

28:16.761 --> 28:19.864
I need to say something,

28:19.964 --> 28:22.267
and then I will leave.

28:26.004 --> 28:27.238
May I sit?

28:40.552 --> 28:43.655
When Bill came to you...

28:43.755 --> 28:45.657
with that big-time
contract offer,

28:45.757 --> 28:47.025
I was stunned.

28:47.125 --> 28:48.727
I wasn't.

28:50.695 --> 28:53.832
Not because I don't
realize how great you are,

28:53.932 --> 28:57.769
but because I'd come to rely
on your talent, your persona.

28:59.537 --> 29:01.272
It was dynamic.

29:01.372 --> 29:03.842
DWL was working.

29:03.942 --> 29:05.643
And I could see
our shared future together.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.046
And then Bill showed up...

29:08.146 --> 29:10.682
with a golden ticket
just for you.

29:12.884 --> 29:15.420
I was not prepared for that.

29:17.355 --> 29:19.537
You were gonna take
your talents elsewhere.

29:19.657 --> 29:22.794
Just like LeBron, motherfucker.

29:25.063 --> 29:27.365
When that happened,
that... that threw me.

29:29.701 --> 29:32.270
I guess it kinda...

29:32.370 --> 29:36.875
I-I--I don't guess.

29:36.975 --> 29:41.146
It knocked me down,
and I was gutted.

29:44.315 --> 29:47.352
Then I was embarrassed
that, uh...

29:47.452 --> 29:50.789
that I wasn't offering up
congratulations to you.

29:54.425 --> 29:57.662
And whether that was
desperation or envy--

29:57.762 --> 30:00.732
- Both.
- What I am sure of is that I--

30:00.732 --> 30:03.034
Humiliated me.

30:06.971 --> 30:09.908
I used what I knew
as your brother,

30:10.008 --> 30:14.712
things only a brother
would know...

30:14.813 --> 30:17.715
to push your buttons.

30:17.715 --> 30:20.151
That, you did.

30:21.152 --> 30:25.156
Then instead of owning up to
that, like a decent person...

30:29.027 --> 30:31.429
I told myself
it was for your own good.

30:36.301 --> 30:39.070
Dad killing himself fucked me up.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.042
More than I care to admit.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.346
More than I thought.

30:53.852 --> 30:57.355
I loved him so much.

30:57.455 --> 31:01.226
I hated him so much.

31:01.326 --> 31:04.562
And I glossed over all that
'cause I couldn't change it.

31:07.712 --> 31:09.901
The love, the hate.

31:10.001 --> 31:12.203
The way he was,
the way he wasn't.

31:14.739 --> 31:16.941
The way he went out.

31:19.277 --> 31:24.148
You and me are trying to
survive after finding out

31:24.249 --> 31:26.551
that Spade men
aren't supposed to survive.

31:29.821 --> 31:32.123
We're supposed to come home

31:32.223 --> 31:35.693
and blow our heads off
on the back porch

31:35.793 --> 31:38.363
and let our sons clean us up.

31:38.463 --> 31:41.199
My God.

31:43.468 --> 31:45.750
That's... terrible.

31:45.870 --> 31:48.139
Jack, that's...

31:49.340 --> 31:52.110
I am truly sorry

31:52.210 --> 31:54.412
for the way
that I've treated you.

32:00.985 --> 32:03.154
Please come home.

32:06.491 --> 32:09.260
Give me a chance to be
a great brother to you.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.801
You were never
a bad big brother.

32:16.901 --> 32:18.569
Only lately.

32:21.606 --> 32:24.609
I'm not a good guy who deserves
a great brother anyway.

32:24.709 --> 32:26.844
I'm a shit heap all on my own.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.280
No, you're not.

32:29.380 --> 32:31.015
Then you don't
know me very well.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.551
I know the heart of you.

32:35.987 --> 32:40.591
Good uncle, teammate, friend.

32:40.692 --> 32:43.861
Jack, I'm not a good guy.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.964
Farthest thing from it.

32:46.064 --> 32:49.100
These people loved you
before I turned you Heel.

32:51.102 --> 32:53.338
Let me help make it right.

32:57.075 --> 33:00.078
Jack, you know what
I realized on this trip?

33:02.860 --> 33:06.584
After several disturbing

33:06.684 --> 33:08.266
interactions...

33:13.391 --> 33:15.693
I'm not good at
making new friends.

33:17.795 --> 33:20.064
I haven't made
a new friend in years.

33:20.164 --> 33:21.432
Making friends was never hard

33:21.532 --> 33:23.401
because I was always
part of a team.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.670
I had, like, instafriends,
guys I met through sports.

33:25.770 --> 33:28.172
Everyone kind of
had to be my friend.

33:28.272 --> 33:30.408
- That's not true.
- Don't tell me that.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.343
I do bad shit.

33:32.443 --> 33:33.911
I say dumb things.
I do dumb things.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.147
I broke Bobby's leg.

33:36.247 --> 33:38.349
I left the DWL because
no one really likes me.

33:38.449 --> 33:39.951
I'm gone because
any other promotion

33:40.051 --> 33:41.219
would have run me outta town.

33:41.319 --> 33:42.787
We're not any other promotion.

33:42.887 --> 33:44.055
But the worst
thing I've done...

33:44.055 --> 33:47.258
the worst thing I've done

33:47.358 --> 33:49.694
is I told you
you were gonna stay in Duffy

33:49.794 --> 33:51.629
and kill yourself like Dad.

33:56.134 --> 33:57.869
It's forgotten.

33:57.969 --> 33:59.771
I'm reminding you.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.939
I'm that guy.

34:01.939 --> 34:06.577
I'm the guy who said that.

34:06.677 --> 34:08.346
What kind of guy says
that to his brother?

34:08.446 --> 34:10.014
Me.

34:10.114 --> 34:12.583
It's in the past.
Don't matter.

34:12.683 --> 34:16.054
Everything that came to me
after that statement,

34:16.154 --> 34:17.922
I set in motion.

34:18.022 --> 34:19.290
That's not true.

34:19.290 --> 34:21.092
Yes, it is.

34:22.727 --> 34:25.430
And yeah, yeah,

34:25.530 --> 34:29.247
you were kinda
dick-ish about the belt,

34:29.367 --> 34:32.470
but I didn't have to say that.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.906
And yet I did.

34:35.006 --> 34:38.376
And I did it
because I'm a selfish fuck

34:38.476 --> 34:40.678
who was praised
his whole life for sports.

34:40.778 --> 34:43.047
And now that sports are over,

34:43.147 --> 34:45.783
I don't know what the fuck
to do when I don't get it.

34:51.556 --> 34:55.093
I'm gonna go out
and get us some food.

34:58.229 --> 35:01.299
I'm not coming home, Jack.

35:29.193 --> 35:32.096
Lord, please help me.

35:35.933 --> 35:40.338
Please... help me.

35:44.242 --> 35:47.245
I need help, Lord.

35:54.418 --> 35:56.754
You know where
you're going next?

35:56.854 --> 36:01.159
Some wonderful, unknown
place called "Not Duffy."

36:03.594 --> 36:05.963
I dunno. Due West?

36:06.063 --> 36:08.813
That's what they say, right?

36:08.933 --> 36:11.135
"Go West, young man.

36:11.235 --> 36:13.204
You're not getting younger."

36:20.077 --> 36:22.413
Sometimes I think about Dad...

36:24.382 --> 36:27.385
And if he's happier... dead.

36:30.955 --> 36:32.890
You ever wonder if it's
like...

36:32.990 --> 36:36.527
...worse?
What comes after this life?

36:38.429 --> 36:40.531
I'm just focused on this life.

36:44.468 --> 36:47.805
I think the thing
that made Dad a sad man

36:47.905 --> 36:51.375
is that...

36:51.475 --> 36:53.778
he wanted
something he never got.

36:55.980 --> 36:59.317
And it made him sad and... mean.

37:01.852 --> 37:04.822
I don't want something
so much like being famous

37:04.922 --> 37:07.925
that I become sad and mean.

37:11.862 --> 37:14.065
The only thing that keeps me
going is not that I think

37:14.165 --> 37:17.435
that this life's gonna be
better, but...

37:19.670 --> 37:22.740
that what comes after
we die might be worse.

37:24.976 --> 37:26.744
I made life hard on you.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.582
I shouldn't have.

37:35.386 --> 37:37.822
I'm really sorry.

37:41.759 --> 37:45.663
Thanks for coming all the
way out here, Jack, really.

37:45.763 --> 37:48.733
If you ever feel bad about
how things went down,

37:48.833 --> 37:51.736
just...

37:51.836 --> 37:54.038
let it go.

37:54.138 --> 37:56.807
It's forgiven.
For reals.

38:00.044 --> 38:04.015
I care about you so very much.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.449
I see that.

38:05.549 --> 38:07.685
Thanks.

38:14.825 --> 38:16.594
Uh...

38:20.231 --> 38:22.366
Please.

38:22.466 --> 38:26.771
For gas money
and the room damage.

39:01.619 --> 39:03.307
Put me down you
big oaf.

39:03.407 --> 39:06.043
- Come on. Come on. Over!
- Help!

39:06.143 --> 39:07.678
Fuck you, Cottonmouth.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.848
Hey.

39:10.948 --> 39:13.451
Hey, Willie, I've been
working on my reporter voice.

39:13.551 --> 39:15.119
Which sucks. Diego.

39:15.219 --> 39:16.454
Tell me why
you're doing the move

39:16.554 --> 39:17.521
I scripted for The Dad.

39:17.621 --> 39:18.789
I told y'all.

39:18.889 --> 39:20.257
I just thought me
ragdolling Crystal

39:20.358 --> 39:21.605
might be more unexpected.

39:21.726 --> 39:23.494
For who, me?

39:23.594 --> 39:24.895
'Cause I was up till 2:00
working on that shit.

39:24.995 --> 39:26.864
I just thought you'd
maybe like this better.

39:26.964 --> 39:28.933
- It's totally my fault.
- It's not totally your fault.

39:28.933 --> 39:30.901
The fault is all of yours
for not doing what I wrote.

39:31.001 --> 39:33.337
Would you do this to Jack?
Huh? I don't think so.

39:33.437 --> 39:35.039
Hey, y'all gotta watch this.

39:35.139 --> 39:36.407
No, Debbie.
Not now.

39:36.507 --> 39:39.043
Willie, I mean it.

39:39.143 --> 39:40.778
If you're just
joining us, shocking video

39:40.878 --> 39:43.314
has surfaced of NFL
linebacker Chris DeLeo

39:43.414 --> 39:44.415
assaulting his wife.

39:46.884 --> 39:51.288
Go [bleep, bleep].

39:52.957 --> 39:54.759
The football
star ragdolling his wife

39:54.859 --> 39:56.494
follows a disturbing
trend of athletes

39:56.594 --> 39:58.262
and domestic violence,

39:58.362 --> 40:01.499
including all-star shortstop
Joe Kwitkowski

40:01.499 --> 40:03.667
caught punching his girlfriend
at a Las Vegas casino.

40:03.768 --> 40:05.503
White House Press
Secretary Millicent Burgin

40:05.603 --> 40:07.772
had this comment moments ago.

40:07.872 --> 40:09.940
The President
condemns the current wave

40:10.040 --> 40:12.109
of violence as
highlighted by the rash

40:12.209 --> 40:15.246
of pro athletes caught on
camera pummeling women.

40:15.346 --> 40:16.847
This Saturday,
he and the First Lady

40:16.847 --> 40:19.917
will lead a call-to-action
march on the National Mall

40:20.017 --> 40:22.653
in an effort to wipe out
this national scourge.

40:22.753 --> 40:23.921
Informal protests

40:24.021 --> 40:25.489
have begun to form
outside the headquarters

40:25.589 --> 40:28.192
of the NFL and MLB.

40:28.292 --> 40:32.930
When we come back, red wine,
superfood or super poison?

40:34.832 --> 40:36.233
Wow.

40:36.333 --> 40:39.470
Y'all take the rest
of the day.

40:39.570 --> 40:41.005
Turn that shit off.

40:46.677 --> 40:48.779
And then
I shit-stamped his face.

40:48.879 --> 40:51.248
Oh, they fuckin' with you, Charlie,

40:51.348 --> 40:53.751
and they
fuckin' with your business.

40:53.851 --> 40:57.121
- Wild Bill has a lotta fans.
- Boom!

40:57.221 --> 40:59.437
Yeah, they're having
a nice laugh.

40:59.557 --> 41:01.025
They think they're funny, guys.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.207
- Yeah, I can be funny.
- Very.

41:03.327 --> 41:05.796
I can be funny, too.

41:10.601 --> 41:13.384
"Winning this title is by far

41:13.504 --> 41:16.373
the greatest
moment in my life.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.876
A life that hasn't
been too full of 'em.

41:18.976 --> 41:23.547
When I won that strap,
I was on top of the world

41:23.647 --> 41:25.149
and y'all helped put me there.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.989
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

41:32.089 --> 41:33.757
We're supposed to take
the rest of the day off.

41:33.858 --> 41:35.960
I was just thinking about
how things might go

41:36.060 --> 41:38.162
when Willie and Jack talk.

41:38.262 --> 41:40.130
Just wanted to walk through
some stuff I was thinking.

41:40.231 --> 41:41.532
Makes sense.

41:41.632 --> 41:43.481
You think they're gonna,
you know, maybe--

41:43.601 --> 41:44.835
- Change things up?
- Yeah.

41:44.935 --> 41:46.837
Yeah. I...

41:46.937 --> 41:48.339
I get why.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.007
Yeah, it's like, you know,
when a big tornado

41:50.107 --> 41:51.475
devastates a town.

41:51.575 --> 41:53.244
No one wants to watch
a tornado movie.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.678
Hmm.
Yeah.

41:54.678 --> 41:55.946
I just...

41:56.046 --> 41:57.648
I just want to wrestle.

41:57.748 --> 41:59.783
I can't tell people what
things can mean or should mean

41:59.884 --> 42:02.152
or how whatever they're
watching means what it means.

42:05.823 --> 42:07.258
You wanna get something
to eat?

42:07.358 --> 42:09.693
Yeah. Sure.

42:09.793 --> 42:10.761
Cool.

42:11.996 --> 42:13.911
Crystal, I gotta
ask you something.

42:15.499 --> 42:17.134
Yes, I was afraid Diego
was gonna drop me.

42:17.234 --> 42:19.637
No.

42:19.737 --> 42:22.740
Uh, did it mean anything when
you kissed me at the fair?

42:25.109 --> 42:27.077
Saying good night?

42:27.177 --> 42:29.680
I thought I felt certain, uh,

42:29.780 --> 42:32.416
a certain something extra.

42:32.516 --> 42:35.286
Tch. Uh...

42:35.386 --> 42:38.335
Not really.

42:38.469 --> 42:40.424
No.

42:40.524 --> 42:44.595
Okay then.
Yeah, it's, uh,

42:44.695 --> 42:46.230
Sorry to have asked.

42:46.330 --> 42:48.566
I guess you can't really
help it if you're naturally

42:48.666 --> 42:50.100
really good at it.

42:50.200 --> 42:54.939
When it means something...
this is how I kiss.

43:04.782 --> 43:06.317
Any other questions?

43:06.417 --> 43:08.819
- Nope.
- Good.

43:08.919 --> 43:12.036
Now if you don't mind,
after dinner,

43:12.136 --> 43:14.925
we should probably just
go to our neutral corners.

43:15.025 --> 43:16.293
Cool down.

43:16.393 --> 43:17.394
Focus.

43:17.494 --> 43:19.630
Sure. Yeah.

43:21.298 --> 43:23.033
I'm just gonna kiss you one
more time first, though.

43:23.133 --> 43:24.868
Sounds good to me.

43:40.351 --> 43:41.318
Hey.

43:42.920 --> 43:43.988
Found him.

43:44.822 --> 43:46.870
He's not coming back.

43:46.991 --> 43:49.226
Sorry, Jack.

43:49.326 --> 43:50.894
He's going West.

43:50.995 --> 43:54.331
Where, not sure.

43:54.331 --> 43:55.599
Wow.

43:56.033 --> 43:57.301
Yeah.

43:59.603 --> 44:00.838
Yep.

44:01.105 --> 44:03.040
How's things here?

44:05.255 --> 44:06.744
You haven't seen the news?

44:06.844 --> 44:09.380
I've been calling you,
texting you, nothing.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.649
- Uh-uh.
- Okay.

44:11.749 --> 44:15.386
All right, well, we
need a women's division.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.354
It's time.

44:17.454 --> 44:18.889
Okay.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.658
Okay. So here,
here's what I think we do.

44:20.758 --> 44:22.026
I think we bring in some
stringers for a while.

44:22.126 --> 44:23.961
Women, you know,
we can't have Crystal

44:24.061 --> 44:26.196
getting beat on each week
by every man on our roster.

44:26.296 --> 44:28.432
And vice versa, she can't
run through everyone.

44:28.432 --> 44:30.501
It's a nice little story,
we've pulled it off this far.

44:30.601 --> 44:33.303
But it's not sustainable
for business.

44:35.539 --> 44:38.909
You all right?

44:39.009 --> 44:42.513
Look, there's a reason your
dad didn't want Ace doing this.

44:42.613 --> 44:45.215
He didn't think
he was built for it.

44:45.315 --> 44:47.251
He did think it was for you.

44:49.253 --> 44:50.888
Last couple days have
been good for me though.

44:50.988 --> 44:52.556
You know,
I think I really found

44:52.656 --> 44:54.291
some story areas
that we can write toward,

44:54.391 --> 44:56.560
that we can keep exploring.

44:56.660 --> 44:58.929
I'm excited about
where we can go.

44:59.029 --> 45:01.612
Just sorry we had to
pivot a bit with Crystal.

45:01.732 --> 45:04.401
She's really something, Jack.

45:04.501 --> 45:05.936
I don't want to
talk about Crystal.

45:07.971 --> 45:11.208
I'm...

45:11.308 --> 45:13.343
rethinking everything.

45:17.581 --> 45:19.349
Understood.

45:21.452 --> 45:23.187
See you later.

45:52.816 --> 45:55.886
How in the hell did
you get in here?!

45:55.986 --> 45:57.721
Still got my key.

45:57.821 --> 45:59.857
You should really
get a keypad, Jack.

45:59.957 --> 46:01.692
We had trouble working
the spotlight at first.

46:01.792 --> 46:03.660
But luckily my cousin
Paul spent a summer

46:03.761 --> 46:05.162
touring with Billy Squire.

46:05.262 --> 46:06.830
What was Squire's
hit song again, Paul?

46:06.930 --> 46:09.366
-"Stroking"?
-"Stroke Me!"

46:09.466 --> 46:11.535
Get off my property. Now.

46:14.738 --> 46:16.039
Turnabout's fair play, Jack.

46:16.140 --> 46:18.142
You came on my property,
now I'm on yours.

46:18.242 --> 46:19.910
I thought about
sticking one of those

46:20.010 --> 46:21.612
big red bows they put
on new cars on myself,

46:21.712 --> 46:23.847
but that seemed like overkill.

46:23.947 --> 46:26.850
Big boy,
I'm here to give props.

46:26.950 --> 46:28.552
I thought you'd painted
yourself into a corner

46:28.652 --> 46:30.053
at the State Fair.

46:30.154 --> 46:31.588
But uh, you booked your way
right out of that.

46:31.688 --> 46:34.725
I mean, Crystal.
Wow, my hat is off.

46:34.825 --> 46:36.326
- Literally.
- Very nice of you

46:36.426 --> 46:38.395
to drive all
this way just to put me over.

46:38.495 --> 46:40.731
I want both of us to get over.
I got a big heart.

46:40.831 --> 46:43.967
It's time we did
a cross-promotion.

46:44.067 --> 46:47.538
Your guys against my guys,
one ring, red rover red rover.

46:47.638 --> 46:49.306
People go nuts. We get rich.

46:49.406 --> 46:50.941
No, thank you.

46:51.041 --> 46:52.643
Leave your key on the way out.

46:52.743 --> 46:54.812
A smart man, a man with
dreams and obligations,

46:54.912 --> 46:57.548
stops walking for a second
and hears me out.

46:57.648 --> 46:59.316
Would that get you
on your way faster?

46:59.416 --> 47:00.684
Think about it.

47:00.784 --> 47:02.786
I got your expat Rooster
here on my payroll.

47:02.886 --> 47:05.255
You decided to fuck with me
and punch me three times.

47:05.355 --> 47:08.792
That crime is the most viewed
video on Dystopia's Instagram.

47:08.892 --> 47:11.195
Bill and his big
hairy fuck buddy Diego

47:11.295 --> 47:13.764
started talking shit about me
on their brand new podcast.

47:13.864 --> 47:15.666
Now I wanna beat
their brains in.

47:15.766 --> 47:17.367
All of this is
"free story," Jack,

47:17.467 --> 47:20.737
the most precious
commodity in our business.

47:20.838 --> 47:24.174
Jack, you know I was
the best on the DWL roster,

47:24.274 --> 47:27.644
and you can get
all of this back.

47:27.744 --> 47:30.113
At least for a couple of cards.

47:30.214 --> 47:32.216
- Fuck you, Deandre.
- Ha ha ha.

47:32.316 --> 47:33.584
Fuck you, Jack.

47:33.684 --> 47:34.751
You fucking
with my money when

47:34.852 --> 47:36.353
you fucking with Dystopia.

47:36.453 --> 47:38.689
Oh, listen, all of you
were fucking with me.

47:38.789 --> 47:40.824
I went down to Florida
to get my brother.

47:40.924 --> 47:43.193
Come clean, Charlie.
You were poaching Ace.

47:43.293 --> 47:45.262
Poaching Ace just like
you poached Rooster.

47:45.362 --> 47:48.065
Don't use the poach on me
like I'm some fucking animal.

47:48.165 --> 47:50.000
Or an egg.

47:50.100 --> 47:52.035
Look, Jack, I just offered
a couple guys a job.

47:52.135 --> 47:53.470
Okay?

47:53.570 --> 47:55.405
Everyone is very tense
with being fucked with.

47:55.505 --> 47:57.975
But here's the thing, we live
in an extraordinary time.

47:58.075 --> 48:00.377
The meaning of
"fuck with" has changed.

48:00.477 --> 48:03.013
The meaning of "fuck with"
has evolved.

48:03.113 --> 48:04.848
How's it go again Rooster?

48:04.948 --> 48:07.718
If I "fuck with" somebody,
it used to be bad.

48:07.818 --> 48:09.119
Now it can be good.

48:09.219 --> 48:12.990
So, if "I fucks with you,"
then we good.

48:13.090 --> 48:16.493
So I wanna take
the old definition,

48:16.593 --> 48:18.996
"You fucked with me,"
bad, and turn it into,

48:19.096 --> 48:20.731
"I fucks with you," good.

48:20.831 --> 48:22.566
Am I getting it right, Rooster?

48:22.666 --> 48:24.001
Oh, you're a quick
learner, Gully.

48:24.101 --> 48:25.669
Yeah, well, young
people keep me young.

48:25.769 --> 48:27.971
Jack, there's money
lying on the floor.

48:28.071 --> 48:31.241
And all we gotta do
is bend over and pick it up.

48:31.341 --> 48:32.709
Not interested.

48:32.809 --> 48:34.711
Jack, I'm here with
an olive branch.

48:34.811 --> 48:36.713
Shove it up your ass.

48:36.813 --> 48:38.916
That's not a nice thing to say.

48:39.016 --> 48:42.519
That's not a nice thing
to do with an olive branch.

48:42.619 --> 48:45.155
When someone presents you
with a peace offering,

48:45.255 --> 48:47.357
especially a potentially
lucrative one,

48:47.457 --> 48:48.992
you should treat it
with some affection,

48:49.092 --> 48:53.163
not tell a guy to
jam it up his bum.

48:53.263 --> 48:56.033
Would you take my olive
branch out of my bum, Jack?

48:56.133 --> 48:58.702
That way we can have peace,
profit, and by the way,

48:58.802 --> 48:59.770
we can have olives.

48:59.870 --> 49:00.704
You like olives, Rooster?

49:00.804 --> 49:01.939
Yes.

49:02.039 --> 49:03.807
Jack don't. Ha ha.

49:03.907 --> 49:06.576
So maybe we should just
go on ahead and go home.

49:06.677 --> 49:07.611
That's a great idea.

49:07.711 --> 49:09.179
Get the fuck on your way.

49:09.279 --> 49:10.781
Okay, Jack, I guess
the time for smokin'

49:10.881 --> 49:12.883
the peace pipe is over.

49:12.983 --> 49:14.918
What in the hell is happening?

49:15.018 --> 49:16.720
How many people you
got hiding around here?

49:16.820 --> 49:20.657
Jack, this fireplug of a man
is my attorney Sam Burphy.

49:20.757 --> 49:22.826
He practices
in Florida and Georgia,

49:22.926 --> 49:25.195
but he especially enjoys
Georgia because he says

49:25.295 --> 49:26.997
it's like fish in a barrel
up here.

49:27.097 --> 49:28.665
Sick 'em, Counselor.

49:28.665 --> 49:30.400
This is personal injury litigation

49:30.500 --> 49:32.202
pursuant to you trespassing
onto petitioner's property

49:32.302 --> 49:33.770
and punching petitioner
in the face.

49:33.870 --> 49:34.871
Yeah.
You can't do that, Jack.

49:34.972 --> 49:35.973
That's assault and battery.

49:36.073 --> 49:37.341
And that's against the law.

49:37.441 --> 49:38.775
My body is my body.

49:38.875 --> 49:40.243
I have a right to its safety.

49:40.344 --> 49:41.578
You violated it.

49:41.678 --> 49:43.213
I lost a crown,
I lost the feeling in my jaw,

49:43.313 --> 49:44.915
and I also lost
about $3 million

49:45.015 --> 49:46.883
worth of personal credibility.

49:46.984 --> 49:48.685
You've been served.

49:48.785 --> 49:50.854
- I'm so good at that.
- Mm-hmm.

49:50.954 --> 49:55.325
Ah-ah-ah, Jack.
Paul's recording.

49:55.425 --> 49:57.828
Also, an officer of
the court is present, me.

49:57.928 --> 50:00.063
So one punch under
these circumstances

50:00.163 --> 50:01.431
will secure
petitioner's victory

50:01.531 --> 50:03.700
and bring on a
second lawsuit, which

50:03.800 --> 50:05.068
petitioner will also win.

50:06.236 --> 50:07.971
Let me stick my chin
out there for you, Jack.

50:08.071 --> 50:11.675
Go ahead. No?

50:11.775 --> 50:14.945
All right, slugger, very good.

50:15.045 --> 50:18.181
You seem to fancy yourself
a master storyteller.

50:18.281 --> 50:19.683
Well, tell me a story
about a man

50:19.783 --> 50:21.518
who thinks he can punch
people without consequence.

50:24.187 --> 50:26.423
That story is not this story.

50:26.523 --> 50:28.992
But in the spirit of
burying the hatchet,

50:29.092 --> 50:32.029
you get to decide what
the consequence will be.

50:32.129 --> 50:34.231
You help me restore
my honor in the ring

50:34.331 --> 50:37.868
with a cross-promotion
between the DWL and Dystopia

50:37.868 --> 50:40.570
or I hit you back
and take everything you got.

50:44.908 --> 50:47.077
It is not for me to ask you

50:47.177 --> 50:49.212
why the consequences
of punching me

50:49.312 --> 50:50.947
never occurred to you.

50:51.048 --> 50:53.250
Maybe they did,
and you dismissed them.

50:53.350 --> 50:55.385
Not smart.

50:55.485 --> 50:59.156
So you decide if you wanna
take the olive branch

50:59.256 --> 51:02.359
out of my bum and work together

51:02.459 --> 51:06.163
or if you wanna watch me take
every goddamn dollar you make

51:06.263 --> 51:08.298
for the rest
of your goddamn life.

51:11.968 --> 51:14.538
I look forward to
hearing from you.

51:16.406 --> 51:18.475
All right, everybody,
back on the bus.

51:36.827 --> 51:39.062
Can't believe you found me.

51:39.162 --> 51:41.465
I care about you.

51:41.565 --> 51:43.366
We shared a lot.

51:50.107 --> 51:52.509
How's that?
Tender?

51:52.609 --> 51:54.144
Yeah, a little.

51:56.847 --> 51:58.515
Thought about you today.

52:00.851 --> 52:02.085
You look different.

52:03.653 --> 52:04.921
How so?

52:05.021 --> 52:06.790
You didn't have any clothes on.

52:08.992 --> 52:10.861
Aah!

52:10.961 --> 52:12.796
That's for Bobby, motherfucker!

52:12.896 --> 52:13.944
Payback time!

52:14.064 --> 52:15.098
Get him!

52:16.433 --> 52:17.767
What the fuck are you doing?!

52:17.868 --> 52:19.402
Fucking you up!

52:20.971 --> 52:22.539
Dad?

52:24.141 --> 52:25.475
Say again, Mr. Spade?

52:26.643 --> 52:30.013
Oh, he said, "Hold it
together, Ace!"

52:30.113 --> 52:31.681
I named you Ace because
you're aces, Ace.

52:31.781 --> 52:34.584
Number one! I warned you
don't give up the fight!

52:34.684 --> 52:36.753
Compete! Compete!

52:36.853 --> 52:37.754
Compete!

52:49.166 --> 52:53.103
Oh, shit.

53:01.478 --> 53:05.282
It's so sexist that we
can't have male wrestlers

53:05.382 --> 53:07.584
beating on female
wrestlers because people

53:07.684 --> 53:09.953
get upset when they see
real men beat real women.

53:10.053 --> 53:11.434
I mean, okay, fine.

53:11.535 --> 53:14.624
But how come they
can't separate the two?

53:14.724 --> 53:18.962
I, me, the Debs, know Crystal
getting punched in the face

53:19.062 --> 53:20.797
is pretend,
for my entertainment,

53:20.897 --> 53:24.067
just like when it happens
to Jack or Diego or Bill.

53:24.167 --> 53:26.102
I said this exact
thing to Bobby.

53:26.203 --> 53:28.371
Why can't people find
it cool that a man

53:28.471 --> 53:31.174
twice the size of Crystal is
launching her across the room?

53:31.174 --> 53:34.211
She's a character.
She's not dead, okay?

53:34.311 --> 53:36.613
She has the belt. We're
gonna make sure she wins.

53:36.713 --> 53:40.050
We just don't want it to look
implausible every second.

53:40.050 --> 53:41.785
She needs something
to fight against.

53:41.785 --> 53:45.055
You show me a woman who doesn't
have to fight against men.

53:45.055 --> 53:47.791
You can't.
It's so sexist!

53:47.891 --> 53:51.074
And the heck with the women
who can't handle watching it.

53:51.194 --> 53:55.565
I'm so sick of estrogen
and fragile female egos.

54:00.136 --> 54:02.305
Not sure
it's fragility or estrogen.

54:02.405 --> 54:03.840
It might just be
people not wanting

54:03.940 --> 54:04.975
to be thinking about
bad stuff while they're

54:05.075 --> 54:06.409
being entertained.

54:06.509 --> 54:08.445
That might be it too.

54:08.545 --> 54:10.480
What do I know?

55:03.333 --> 55:05.635
Is it too late to say sorry?

55:09.339 --> 55:13.443
I'm sorry I put the DWL first.

55:13.543 --> 55:16.413
And I'm sorry that
I haven't been the best me.

55:16.513 --> 55:19.783
I'm sorry I kept
your son from you.

55:19.883 --> 55:23.119
I'm sorry.

55:23.219 --> 55:26.790
I'm...
I'm sorry too.

55:27.991 --> 55:29.926
I love you so much.

55:30.026 --> 55:32.996
I love you.

55:33.096 --> 55:34.964
He missed you.

56:02.559 --> 56:04.794
- Want Mama's bacon?
- Yes, please.

56:04.894 --> 56:05.862
Thank you very much.

56:27.550 --> 56:31.855
Uh, Mom doesn't
want me home.

56:31.955 --> 56:33.890
Can I stay here?

56:33.990 --> 56:36.192
Uncle Ace!

56:36.292 --> 56:37.427
Of course.

56:38.928 --> 56:40.130
I missed you.

56:40.230 --> 56:42.198
Hey, dude.
