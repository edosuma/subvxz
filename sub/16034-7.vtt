00:50.480 --> 00:52.459
(Men calling out)

01:08.440 --> 01:10.988
VERCOE: Will there be war, do you think?
- Inevitably.

01:11.160 --> 01:15.347
One does not send an anointed king
to the guillotine and expect no consequences.

01:15.520 --> 01:16.987
People are nervous.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.949
As well, they might be.
Jacobin clubs close.

01:20.120 --> 01:23.260
- Folk dig out old weaponry in readiness.
- For war?

01:23.440 --> 01:25.419
Or for free trading?

01:26.040 --> 01:28.668
Trencrom appears to be plotting his next run.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.662
Our informants have been lying low,
so, hopefully, we'll catch 'em off guard.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.426
(Sawing)

01:49.240 --> 01:50.628
Garrick! Go to.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.461
- See 'em off!
- Nay, Mistress Poldark.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.144
- We come at the behest of Mr Trencrom.
- I know why 'ee come and who sent 'ee.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.988
Garrick! Garrick!

02:21.280 --> 02:24.943
What do you think?
I reckon there's more tin in this than copper.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.588
Well, copper lodes do often peter out that way.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.947
What happens further down? Is there
more chance of copper at a greater depth?

02:32.120 --> 02:34.543
Some would say our only chance.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.585
What do you say?

02:36.760 --> 02:39.388
That she's been a grievous disappointment.

02:39.560 --> 02:44.429
Never a sign ofthe old Trevorgie lode, whether
we come at it from Leisure or from Grace.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.023
Yet Mark Daniel swore.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.259
Mark Daniel swore.

02:50.440 --> 02:53.659
(Sighs) If I were you,
I'd not throw good money after bad.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.389
Captain Henshawe reckons
we've enough coal to last two weeks.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.539
Three, ifwe close the lower levels.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.619
But our only hope is to go deeper.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.979
Then we go deeper.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.427
Mr Trencrom did send his regrets.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.103
Mr Trencrom can keep his regrets
and take his goods.

03:27.280 --> 03:30.659
'Twas never the agreement to leave them
three weeks afore they're fetched.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.788
It's taking advantage. I don't like folks taking
advantage and neither do Ross.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.748
Is it true? Your promissory note was paid?

03:47.920 --> 03:51.469
It seems we both have a mysterious benefactor.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.505
Could it be the same?

03:54.520 --> 03:56.909
- Who knows?
- I'm glad of it.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.503
Though, in some ways, I regret the change.

04:00.520 --> 04:04.980
Now I've no further interest in Grace,
you no longer have a reason to call.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.344
I will always have reason to call.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.619
If you wish it.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.146
I wish it.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.829
(Puppeteer speaking as Mr Punch)

04:23.000 --> 04:24.740
(Laughter)

04:24.920 --> 04:28.185
Those properties we spoke of,
have they been acquired?

04:28.360 --> 04:30.385
The deal will shortly be concluded.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.425
Unwin has his uses.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.988
When will you demolish them?

04:34.160 --> 04:37.823
- All in good time. First, we increase the rents.
- The tenants will object.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.343
Then we evict them. Then we demolish.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.385
Then we build.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.539
The Warleggan bank!

04:53.000 --> 04:54.581
- Morning.
- Morning, Dwight.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.379
- Good day to you, Jacka.
- Is it?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.980
Surgeon! Welcome.
You couldn't have come on a better day.

05:04.160 --> 05:08.108
- You're in high spirits, sir.
- Well, so would 'ee be, were 'ee in my shoes.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.421
Rosina has agreed to wed me.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.304
I hope you'll both be very happy.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.464
Now, er...how are you, Betty?

05:22.640 --> 05:25.268
Will you open your mouth
so I can look at your throat?

05:26.360 --> 05:29.625
- Aye, sir, we have you to thank.
- So we have.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.507
Rosina's lipsy leg cured.
Me and my consumptives.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.466
And now earning fair from sail making.

05:34.640 --> 05:37.905
So I see.
It certainly seems to afford you a good living.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.106
Hard work do that, Surgeon,
as you did ought to know.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.668
And when is the wedding to be?

05:42.840 --> 05:46.105
Well, the banns are called this Sunday.
Nothing to wait for now, is there?

05:47.400 --> 05:48.981
Your turn next, Surgeon.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.023
- We shan't trouble 'ee again.
- Till the next drop.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.863
Be sure to make no commotion as you leave
and bring the gaugers down upon us.

06:06.040 --> 06:07.905
(Clattering, Garrick barks)

06:08.080 --> 06:10.867
Oh, my ivers! 'Tis they, the gaugers.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.019
Go. Go!

06:15.240 --> 06:17.504
So do 'ee bring his fizzog home sometimes?

06:17.680 --> 06:20.467
I be about Trencrom's business!
I be his man now!

06:20.640 --> 06:23.746
- I'll give you such a lib sin...
- Hush your clack, woman!

06:23.920 --> 06:25.501
I didn't come home to argeefy!

06:25.680 --> 06:26.749
No, no!

06:26.920 --> 06:28.262
Leave him be. Jud!

06:28.440 --> 06:29.702
- (Garrick barks)
- Enough!

06:29.880 --> 06:32.269
- Aah!
- Two stomachs to eat and neither one to work!

06:36.880 --> 06:39.348
The noble art of Cornish wrestling.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.259
- You have a message for me?
- Aye.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.388
Ohh.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.819
Mark Daniel has been found.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.539
- Where?
- Cherbourg, he was.

06:59.720 --> 07:04.145
Then, with all this kick and sprawl, folk did look
at him askance, so he slips offto the Scillies.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.538
- Can a message be got to him?
- 'Tis done already.

07:06.720 --> 07:10.269
Mr Trencrom's ship, The One & All,
sets sail for France tomorrow on a run.

07:10.440 --> 07:15.468
Look in to St Mary's on his way to France. Mark
will meet 'ee there. He'll return the same way.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.505
I don't like it, Ross.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.864
You'd be joining a smuggling run.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.140
There's no other way. I must meet him.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.380
- I'll tell Mr Trencrom.
- Aye, and when that's done,

07:27.560 --> 07:29.266
drag his sneivy carcass back here.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.021
- No, 'tis too risky.
- Nay, but...

07:31.200 --> 07:32.622
There is an informer about.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.827
The last few runs we've had no trouble,
so Trencrom do reckon he's gone elsewhere.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.342
Aanays, tid'n I?

07:38.520 --> 07:41.705
- Pick my liver, do 'ee thinkI be such a man?
- No, of course not.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.620
Informers be sharp and witsy.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.062
Exactly.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.579
(Door opens)

08:03.680 --> 08:05.500
I see I have a rival.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.386
"From Rosina, with love."

08:08.400 --> 08:10.539
Is that how all your patients address you?

08:10.720 --> 08:12.779
Orjust those in receipt of miracles?

08:19.680 --> 08:22.945
Uncle Ray bids me to travel to London
with him on the third.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.748
So we must escape on the second.
It will make my packing all the easier.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.980
Instead of escaping with a bundle
through the window,

08:31.160 --> 08:34.664
I can have my trunks downstairs
and safely stowed in the coach.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.464
What is it? Do you not want to marry me?

08:40.560 --> 08:42.027
Oh, Caroline.

08:42.200 --> 08:46.227
Marrying you, openly,
would set a seal on my happiness

08:46.400 --> 08:49.187
which I don't deserve, but would gladly take.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.226
Marrying you in secret,
running away with you at night...

08:53.400 --> 08:54.469
Yes?

08:54.640 --> 08:57.666
..it smacks of dishonesty, ofthe fortune hunter.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.705
Which we both know you are not.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.543
Why can we not go to your uncle
and tell him what we intend?

09:03.720 --> 09:07.907
Have I not explained? Ifwe run away in secret,
Uncle Ray will be furious, but...

09:08.080 --> 09:11.538
And rightly so. He'll denounce us
in the strongest possible terms.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.585
But only to himself.

09:13.760 --> 09:18.538
In a year, he will calm down and then there will
be nothing to prevent a reconciliation.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.188
He will accept what cannot be changed.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.509
Exactly.

09:22.680 --> 09:27.379
But a direct confrontation, "I will marry this man,
with or without your blessing",

09:27.560 --> 09:30.267
I will be going expressly against his wishes.

09:30.440 --> 09:34.308
He and I will argue, his pride will prevent him
from backing down and...

09:34.480 --> 09:36.459
I will never see him again.

09:38.920 --> 09:42.060
I acknowledge the rationale,
but dislike the subterfuge.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.105
Because you are too honourable.

09:44.280 --> 09:47.784
Because my honour has been
compromised before. You know this.

09:49.280 --> 09:53.228
The girl I fell in love with, Keren Daniel,
she, too, was a patient of mine

09:53.400 --> 09:57.143
and though her death was not at my hands,
it is on my conscience.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.459
- ThatI understand, but...
- Also on my conscience

09:59.640 --> 10:02.063
is the fact that you are giving up
your fortune for me.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.901
In the first place, I am not.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.581
I am just deferring it.

10:05.760 --> 10:11.539
And, in the second, even if I were,
it would be worth it, to be your wife.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.389
- Do you doubt me?
- Not your intent.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.859
But you may find the reality
less romantic than you imagine.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.743
(Jud and Prudie arguing and yelling)

10:35.000 --> 10:36.865
Conjugal bliss.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.019
A rare commodity.

10:40.280 --> 10:41.429
Yes.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.306
(Distant arguing)

10:46.400 --> 10:48.379
(Birdsong)

10:50.160 --> 10:52.708
AUNT AGATHA: Are those plaguy
scavengers here again?

10:52.880 --> 10:55.019
ELIZABETH: The Reverend and his family?
Yes.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.781
In our house.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.428
Once a week, Aunt. You know of our obligation.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.264
Along with repairs to the church.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.305
Walls. Bridges.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.345
Aims for the poor.

11:08.520 --> 11:12.263
A fine trick to bleed dry
the foremost family ofthe district.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.180
The once foremost family.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.579
A pity their appetites show no such decline.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.941
Where's Ross?

11:21.120 --> 11:23.224
Why does he not visit so often?

11:23.960 --> 11:26.224
Ross has his own affairs to attend to.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.979
We can manage without him.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.699
How long will you be gone?

11:49.880 --> 11:51.347
Two days.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.499
Depends on the weather.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.464
The One & All will load goods in France
and return to collect me.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.339
I'll be taking Henshawe and Paul.

12:03.440 --> 12:07.103
Mark will be glad to see his brother. Henshawe
knows Grace like the back of his hand.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.828
He'll have questions for Mark
which might not occur to me.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.706
Is this really our last chance?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.665
We have two weeks of coal left.

12:14.840 --> 12:17.229
After that, the pumping engine stops.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.821
And so does Grace.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.422
Don't 'ee fret, maid.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.465
Old Jud will be on the case.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.619
Well, that'd make all the difference.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.345
Why did we not look for Mark sooner?

12:49.520 --> 12:53.388
All this time, we could have had clear direction
instead of guesswork.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.063
And Grace could be in profit.
Maybe your luck's turning.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.743
First your mystery benefactor.
Now the finding of Mark.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.581
A change in our fortunes?

13:00.760 --> 13:02.739
I could certainly drink to that.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.585
Two angels in the sky.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.739
That's a pretty picture, Hubert.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.184
- Did you colour it yourself?
- Yes.

13:22.080 --> 13:26.619
Give him ginger, oil of anise and clarified honey.
That should settle his stomach.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.267
- Thank you.
- And you, sir?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.305
Are you in good health?

13:30.480 --> 13:32.459
Aye, sir, weary to the bone.

13:33.520 --> 13:37.388
Up all hours ofthe day and night
in pursuit ofthe free traders.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.825
- You take your duty to heart.
- If I don't, who will?

13:41.680 --> 13:45.662
'Tis a thankless task,
but I expect my patience to be rewarded.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.425
And I reckon it is coming.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.579
You can be sure ofthat.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.099
(Men shouting)

14:03.800 --> 14:05.745
(Low conversation)

14:14.160 --> 14:15.548
(Man calls out)

14:41.000 --> 14:44.265
- You will ride to Trenwith.
- To what purpose?

14:44.440 --> 14:47.102
To alert the family to the latest events in France,

14:47.280 --> 14:51.148
the execution ofthe King,
the expected response from London.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.709
Warn Mistress Poldark of potential unrest.

14:53.880 --> 14:56.667
Advise _her to make secure
her Windows and doors.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.705
But will this not frighten her?

14:58.880 --> 15:00.347
It may well.

15:07.480 --> 15:10.859
Tell Mr Warleggan
I'm grateful for his concern, but...

15:12.200 --> 15:16.068
Had he no other suggestions to make?
No assistance to offer?

15:16.240 --> 15:21.382
I think he felt it would be impertinent to interfere
with your domestic arrangements, ma'am.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.027
Of course.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.579
That's most thoughtful of him.
Please convey my thanks.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.022
I'll ask Tabb to secure all the locks and bolts.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.259
Or, better still, fetch me a pistol.

15:38.440 --> 15:41.785
- I could stop an intruder in his tracks.
- I don't doubt it, Aunt.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.939
With or without a firearm.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.581
To Ross?

15:48.600 --> 15:52.468
I thought I might ask him to call and advise us.
I know you'd welcome that.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.107
Of course.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.226
'Tis only my comfort that concerns him here.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.469
Hmph.

16:01.080 --> 16:04.106
Mr Ross ain't here, but he'll see it on his return.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.145
God bless 'ee, child!

16:06.320 --> 16:07.981
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

16:08.160 --> 16:09.661
(Giggles)

16:10.760 --> 16:12.625
- (Knocks)
- Oh, what now?

16:12.800 --> 16:14.188
Is your master at home?

16:14.360 --> 16:15.622
Er...

16:21.640 --> 16:23.426
(Door opens)

16:24.240 --> 16:25.821
Oh, Dwight.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.744
I...I didn't mean to disturb you.
I called because Ross is usually home now.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.184
He's away a few days. Is it urgent?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.949
Er, not in the ordinary sense.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.304
Why don't you ask Jinny to make us some tea?

16:47.760 --> 16:50.820
I know that Ross won't mind me
telling you thIs, but...

16:51.840 --> 16:53.580
..he's gone with Trencrom's ship,

16:53.760 --> 16:56.740
dropping off at the Scilly Isles
to meet Mark Daniel.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.983
Then The One & All will pick up Ross
and bring him home,

17:00.160 --> 17:02.822
when they anchor off our cove for the drop.

17:04.320 --> 17:08.188
It seems a lifetime since that night,
when you stood between me and Mark.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.942
- He would have killed you.
- I'd have welcomed it.

17:11.120 --> 17:13.987
I'd betrayed everyone
and everything I held most dear,

17:14.160 --> 17:17.459
but that's the last thing
I want to remember tonight, I...

17:18.560 --> 17:20.425
I came to tell you I'm leaving.

17:20.600 --> 17:21.988
To be with Caroline?

17:22.160 --> 17:23.787
How did you guess?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.939
(Scoffs) And you're to marry?

17:27.040 --> 17:29.588
- Oh, Dwight!
- But her uncle forbids it.

17:29.760 --> 17:33.264
So we must do it in secret.
We leave on Friday night.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.547
- Well, cannot you stay here?
- Not within her uncle's reach.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.462
And, besides, I owe it to Caroline to start afresh

17:40.640 --> 17:43.825
in a new town,
where my history with Keren is unknown.

17:45.280 --> 17:48.864
Well, I'm...I'm happy for your sake,
but... for ours...

17:50.400 --> 17:52.584
You'll be sorely missed.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.659
I want you to know and to tell Ross...

17:57.760 --> 17:59.227
..how much I owe to you both.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.859
Leaving like this, it's...

18:03.600 --> 18:06.068
..it's...it's a great sorrow to me.

18:08.640 --> 18:11.222
Marrying for love is not a time for grieving.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.663
Worry about us and our ailments till Friday,

18:14.840 --> 18:18.389
but...then build your new life
as ifwe'd never been.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.829
Mark said he'd meet us at the Quayside Inn.

18:48.760 --> 18:49.909
PAUL: 50 men?

18:50.080 --> 18:52.423
I'd hope to employ twice that
before next year is out.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.989
IfI could see
all Grambler and Sawle employed...

18:55.160 --> 18:57.503
- 'Twould be a fine thing.
- 'Twould indeed.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.545
Well, here's to that.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.062
And to Mark.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.026
- In him we trust.
HENSHAWE: To Mark.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.107
Miss Penvenen.

19:32.280 --> 19:36.626
I was passing and it struck me as remiss
I have never paid a call.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.899
And soon you'll be leaving for Bath.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.422
Oh.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.261
Did Dwight say so?

19:43.440 --> 19:46.785
And here I am thinking
that he might have changed his mind.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.541
Why would he?

19:48.720 --> 19:50.301
You know men.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.947
So changeable.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.587
Do you not find?

19:53.760 --> 19:57.662
I think Dr Enys is as like as any
to remain steadfast.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.064
Is that your experience of husbands?

20:01.240 --> 20:03.458
I mean, generally, to be relied upon?

20:06.360 --> 20:08.908
- Some tea?
- Why not?

20:09.080 --> 20:10.388
(Rings bell)

20:11.920 --> 20:15.708
And how fares Captain Poldark's
mining venture? Is that also secure?

20:15.880 --> 20:17.745
Far from it.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.501
Oh, dear.

20:20.680 --> 20:23.660
Well, I suppose one can't have everything.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.819
I suppose one cannot.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.659
Did Ross reply?

20:41.320 --> 20:43.299
He did not.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.059
It's unlike him to be so remiss.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.184
I wonder what could have detained him.

21:11.920 --> 21:15.788
(Drunken singing) ..a preacher stout,
a burning, shining light

21:15.960 --> 21:17.666
The people all said

21:17.840 --> 21:21.822
What he has in his head
will surely turn out right

21:22.000 --> 21:23.547
Oh...

21:23.720 --> 21:29.260
The keenly lode, the keenly lode,
of bals the best, my boys...

21:29.440 --> 21:31.146
(Singing stops)

21:32.240 --> 21:35.186
Brother! Oh, 'tis good to see 'ee.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.701
How are you?

21:51.320 --> 21:54.869
CAROLINE: Deaeright,
I'm afraid there's been a complication.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.019
W have to meet tomorrow morning.

22:06.600 --> 22:11.105
I never touch it now.
I keep a guard on my tongue, night and day.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.425
You know why we wished to meet?

22:14.600 --> 22:18.468
Like you said in your letter,
about what I saw down Grace that night.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.949
Ever since I've been trying to think.

22:21.120 --> 22:23.987
- 'Ee don't remember, brother?
- Oh, I mind what I saw.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.627
But where I see'd it?

22:25.800 --> 22:27.506
I was fair crazed that night.

22:27.680 --> 22:31.264
- Would a plan ofthe workings help?
- Oh, it would. It would, indeed.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.462
Well...

22:42.640 --> 22:43.982
Wait.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.025
I went down here.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.667
Go on.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.819
I... I think there was water.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.899
And then I walked in the 30 level.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.467
I sat down and thought to end it all by drowning.

23:00.960 --> 23:04.100
Then I got up and I went bearing east.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.259
Across a plank, half rotten.

23:07.840 --> 23:10.024
You gave her a headstone, like I asked?

23:10.200 --> 23:12.179
We gave her a headstone.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.942
"Keren Daniel, wife of Mark, aged 22."

23:16.120 --> 23:17.985
Like you asked.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.821
22.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.979
Still a child.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.989
That surgeon, Enys,
it was 'ee I should have killed.

23:27.160 --> 23:29.025
Try to remember, Mark.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.100
Where did you go next?

23:32.200 --> 23:36.227
Just above the gunnies, bearing right,
there's an old pick down there.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.459
I took it up and began to cast around.

23:38.640 --> 23:40.267
A fine bit of ground it looked.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.499
Where was it? Just...here?

23:42.680 --> 23:44.068
I reckon.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.902
I went on again, climbing all the while.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.900
- There was an old air shaft.
- Here?

23:50.080 --> 23:52.105
It was all filled in.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.701
I reckon I was barely 15 fathom from grass.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.780
And from there, you can turn three ways.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.427
I turned east.

24:02.600 --> 24:06.149
And you go down over broken ground
where the lode has been worked,

24:06.320 --> 24:08.185
but...only the bottom.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.749
The backs is untouched.

24:10.920 --> 24:14.344
There be fine quartzy rock and gossan.

24:16.040 --> 24:21.307
It was too high for me to get at, but I'd wager
there'd be a mint of money in that place alone.

24:21.480 --> 24:23.459
Just...here?

24:23.920 --> 24:25.501
Just here.

24:28.280 --> 24:30.145
And, after that, you came up?

24:30.320 --> 24:32.299
And after that I came up.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.419
Thank you, Mark.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.987
Thank 'ee.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.829
(Hissing)

24:44.000 --> 24:46.901
(Thud of machinery)

24:53.880 --> 24:56.622
'Twas when he mentioned quartz
and I looked at ye.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.461
'Twas the first thing we found.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.949
- And it barely paid for the working.
- Mm.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.585
- I blame myself.
- Nay, Cap'n Ross.

25:04.760 --> 25:09.709
To pin everything on the ramblings of a man
crazed with grief and rage, what was I thinking?

25:09.880 --> 25:11.541
It could have been true.

25:11.720 --> 25:16.862
At the outset, perhaps, but experienced miners
cannot work for months on end

25:17.040 --> 25:19.304
and not find whatever good ground is there.

25:19.480 --> 25:21.345
It's the old story.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.499
The drowning man and the straw.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.181
- I only wish...
- Yes?

25:45.360 --> 25:50.059
That there was some other way,
which did not require us to leave so furtively.

25:51.160 --> 25:52.468
Or leave at all.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.540
What do you mean?

25:54.720 --> 25:57.462
Are you sure you don't regret
more than the manner of our leaving?

25:57.640 --> 26:00.780
Ever since we decided to go,
I've noticed a reluctance in you.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.428
Not at all. I love you.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.579
What reluctance could I have?

26:07.400 --> 26:09.061
Yet I wonder.

26:09.240 --> 26:10.707
Six months from now,

26:10.880 --> 26:15.465
will you not sometimes sigh for your Cornish life
and your Cornish Rosinas?

26:15.640 --> 26:19.383
I may well. They matter to me.
I cannot pretend to be indifferent to their fate.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.786
But my mind is set.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.379
So, tonight, then?

26:31.800 --> 26:33.779
Tonight.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.545
(Knocks)

26:41.720 --> 26:45.827
Inquire of Mistress Poldark if her safety
measures are in place. Urge her to be vigilant.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.547
Word has reached me of some tinners

26:47.720 --> 26:51.224
who propose to claim their right
under Stannary Law to enter private land.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.425
Warn her to be on her guard.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.348
Prospect for tin?

27:00.520 --> 27:01.908
On our land?

27:02.080 --> 27:04.708
These people are a law
unto themselves, ma'am,

27:04.880 --> 27:07.986
and Mr Warleggan fears
they may be encouraged to rise up

27:08.160 --> 27:10.902
by the example oftheir French counterparts.

27:13.520 --> 27:16.500
Once again,
I thank Mr Warleggan for his concern.

27:19.200 --> 27:23.421
If Mr Warleggan is so concerned,
why does he not come here himself?

27:24.440 --> 27:27.989
The male ofthe species, inadequate, at best.

27:28.160 --> 27:31.345
Better to rely on one's own resources.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.707
I'm away to Sawle to see ifthere's any news.

27:43.800 --> 27:47.384
Keep Jeremy from his nap.
I want him sound asleep all through it.

27:51.240 --> 27:52.901
May I speak with Ross?

27:53.080 --> 27:54.547
He's from home.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.824
Did he not receive my note?

27:58.680 --> 28:00.307
Prudie?

28:00.480 --> 28:02.744
- Do 'ee know of any note?
- Yes, Mistress.

28:02.920 --> 28:06.504
I do give it to Mr Ross myself,
into his very own hand.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.947
Oh.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.065
Then I expect he was too busy to reply.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.344
Yes. I expect he was.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.628
Here you go. I've got potatoes...

29:05.800 --> 29:07.188
Mistress Demelza!

29:07.360 --> 29:09.100
Ohh!

29:09.280 --> 29:11.145
Rosina!

29:11.320 --> 29:13.459
Is it your knee?

29:15.480 --> 29:19.428
'Tis like it belonged to before Dr Enys mend it.
Only now it is worse.

29:19.600 --> 29:21.989
- We should send for him.
- I'll set Charlie to it.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.707
Nay, he be sick. Remember?

29:23.880 --> 29:25.745
Dr Enys bid him to keep to his bed.

29:25.920 --> 29:29.708
I'll go. You keep her warm and still.
I'll be back directly.

29:47.640 --> 29:49.619
(Knock at door)

29:52.680 --> 29:54.545
Demelza, what brings you here?

29:54.720 --> 29:57.939
Rosina Hoblyn, 'tis her knee locked again.
Can 'ee tend on her?

29:58.120 --> 29:59.428
I...I fear I cannot.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.387
My plans have changed.
I'm due to leave with Caroline.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.266
Tonight? But...I... I thought...

30:04.440 --> 30:06.419
It was tomorrow, yes, but her uncle...

30:06.600 --> 30:08.818
No, no, you must go. I'll see to Rosina.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.865
Maybe call Dr Choake.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.746
Yes. That would...

30:12.920 --> 30:15.866
No. Wait. Er... I cannot allow that.
She's my patient.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.780
Caroline's expecting you.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.463
I think, if I leave now, there'll be time.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.983
For the first time in my life, I feel old.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.469
We're none of us as young as we were, Ross.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.619
These last few years...

30:40.000 --> 30:41.979
Often I've known failure, but...

30:43.080 --> 30:45.947
..I always believed it was a temporary setback,
but this time...

30:46.120 --> 30:48.179
- 'Twas a brave venture.
- Was It?

30:48.360 --> 30:50.828
I begin to think it was the height of my folly.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.819
To throw away a profitable investment

30:55.000 --> 30:59.027
and pour everything I had,
and persuade Francis to do likewise,

30:59.200 --> 31:02.579
into a played-out mine that failed my father
a quarter of a century back?

31:06.040 --> 31:09.908
I didn'tjust gamble with money. I gambled
with the happiness and security of my workers

31:10.080 --> 31:12.628
and, most especially, that of my wife and child.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.461
What'll 'ee do now?

31:14.640 --> 31:16.983
(Sighs) Learn my lesson.

31:18.200 --> 31:22.182
Plough my fields, harvest my crops,
cherish my family.

31:24.680 --> 31:26.261
Live a quiet life.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.465
There's a lot to be said for it.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.619
My wife would agree with you.

31:41.880 --> 31:43.347
Tell me what happened.

31:43.520 --> 31:46.387
I turned it on the cobbles, sir,
and it sudden go all tight.

31:46.560 --> 31:50.348
We thought to send Charlie for 'ee, but since
he be sick, Mistress Poldark did kindly go.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.023
- What's the matter with Charlie?
- You did ought to know that.

31:53.200 --> 31:56.909
'Tis on account of 'ee telling him to stay abed
that he's not helping with the run tonight.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.866
Aargh! Aargh!

32:00.200 --> 32:02.179
There now.

32:05.080 --> 32:07.469
- What did 'ee do?
- Can you stand?

32:09.560 --> 32:11.425
(Giggles) 'Tis all mended?

32:11.600 --> 32:14.023
Oh, sir, I'm that grateful.

32:14.200 --> 32:18.068
- 'Twas afeared 'twas gone for good.
- I think you should wear a bandage.

32:18.240 --> 32:21.505
At least until the tendons knit together
and if it ever happens again...

32:21.680 --> 32:24.945
Why, sir, if it do, we'll just make her sit quiet
till we call for 'ee again.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.304
- You'll take a dram?
- No, I...

32:28.400 --> 32:30.265
Thank you. That's most kind.

32:30.440 --> 32:33.466
- (Jacka pours drink)
- What's this about Charlie?

32:33.640 --> 32:37.383
- Did he tell you I said he must go to bed?
- Not I, but them as wanted his help with the run.

32:37.560 --> 32:38.902
I don't understand.

32:39.080 --> 32:42.629
Trencrom's ship is coming in tonight.
They sent round to tell him to be ready.

32:42.800 --> 32:46.941
But he said he's a fever and the surgeon said
he must stay abed, on account of his lungs.

32:47.120 --> 32:49.179
I said no such thing.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.863
Why would he tell such a strammin' great tale?

32:54.520 --> 32:56.181
Your wedding's in a fortnight?

32:56.360 --> 32:57.429
Aye.

32:57.600 --> 33:01.149
He'd be anxious about the risk and about
his health. It's a thing any man would do.

33:01.320 --> 33:04.062
- I must leave you now.
- Till 'ee come again.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.906
It's been my privilege to be able to help you all.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.901
The informer...

33:25.480 --> 33:27.459
..could it be Charlie?

33:28.680 --> 33:30.545
- You must keep to your plans.
- No.

33:30.720 --> 33:33.939
- I can go to Charlie and still get to Killewarren.
- What will you do?

33:34.120 --> 33:36.065
Confirm our suspicions. We may be mistaken.

33:36.240 --> 33:39.107
But the drop's tonight.
What ifthere's an ambush?

33:40.520 --> 33:42.067
- I'll come with you.
- No. You must not.

33:42.240 --> 33:45.061
If you're seen out and about
and the ambush is set...

33:45.240 --> 33:47.219
Go home. I'll to Charlie.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.299
Then ride like the wind to Caroline.

34:03.320 --> 34:04.787
(Sighs)

34:06.600 --> 34:08.261
Was that a yawn, Horace?

34:08.440 --> 34:11.420
I know, my pet.
We have a long journey tomorrow.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.305
And Uncle Ray is looking weary.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.380
Assure...Horace...

34:17.400 --> 34:20.267
..that Uncle Ray, though undoubtedly ancient,

34:20.440 --> 34:23.580
still has enough stamina
to complete his correspondence.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.382
Is it important?

34:26.560 --> 34:30.826
Instructions to my steward, regarding the estate
while we're...while we're away.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.865
How odious I should find that.

34:33.040 --> 34:36.180
Well, all the more reason
to marry wisely, my dear.

34:36.360 --> 34:41.980
When you come to inherit, you'll be grateful
for a husband who takes such matters in hand.

34:52.920 --> 34:55.104
Lottie, I've come to visit your father.

34:59.520 --> 35:02.262
- It's good of 'ee to call, sir.
- Sit up. I want to examine you.

35:02.440 --> 35:03.941
- Nay.
- Sit up, man.

35:04.720 --> 35:07.621
You say you have a fever?
Let me see what ails you.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.179
DEMELZA: Good evening to you, sir.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.387
'Tis a fine night.

35:25.160 --> 35:26.422
Aye.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.825
Well, if you will not retire, then I must.
My eyes will not stay open.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.581
Right, I won't be long.

35:59.720 --> 36:02.302
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.385
- You have no fever.
- Nay, Sir.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.266
Three hours gone, I was all of a shrim...

36:12.440 --> 36:16.024
Why the sham? An excuse to avoid your part
in the tub-carrying?

36:16.200 --> 36:20.307
I swear, first it come on me like ice.
Next, I was sweating like a weed.

36:20.480 --> 36:23.347
For two years, there's been an informer about.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.385
Well, everyone know that.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.221
Have 'ee caught him?

36:27.400 --> 36:29.379
I rather think I have.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.264
Stay alert, men. They could be anywhere.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.539
Well, that's a fine thing to say!

36:40.000 --> 36:41.661
How do you afford these curtains?

36:41.840 --> 36:43.307
Those candlesticks?

36:43.480 --> 36:44.902
Out of sail-making?

36:45.080 --> 36:46.945
Or selling your friends?

36:47.120 --> 36:49.941
Get out. Now! _
And take your nasty suspICIons With 'ee!

36:50.120 --> 36:53.544
It's you who should get out, before your friends
realise you've betrayed them.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.585
Thee's the betrayer. Making eyes at Rosina,

36:55.760 --> 36:57.705
fingering her knee
when 'ee think no-one's looking?

36:57.880 --> 36:59.222
- What time is the run?
- I don't know.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.265
Is there an ambush?

37:01.440 --> 37:03.305
- I don't know.
- I think you do know.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.948
Think what 'ee like. You've no proof I'm a traitor.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.501
I beg to differ.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.944
- Where did you get this book?
- I buyed it.

37:14.120 --> 37:15.587
- Where?
- Redruth.

37:15.760 --> 37:19.708
This book belonged to Hubert Vercoe,
the Customs Officer's son.

37:19.880 --> 37:22.019
- I saw it in his hands.
- That proves naught!

37:22.200 --> 37:24.384
- There are many such books.
- None like this.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.903
With the angels' wings coloured red
by Hubert himself.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.142
- There was a soldier.
- Save us!

37:31.320 --> 37:32.901
- Where?
- By the long field.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.184
And Ross will walk straight into the ambush.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.587
- What will 'ee do?
- You'll know when I've done it.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.705
You go home, Surgeon.

37:41.880 --> 37:43.745
Forget what 'ee see'd.

37:43.920 --> 37:46.104
There's nothing you can do now.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.827
Pssst!

38:02.440 --> 38:04.908
Stay low. Stay low.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.504
Keep the candles burning
and don't let anyone enter.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.261
Why, maid, what do 'ee intend?

38:10.440 --> 38:13.989
I'm gonna try and get down to the cove
and warn 'em before the ship comes ashore.

38:22.360 --> 38:24.066
(The One & All creaks)

38:25.160 --> 38:28.618
There's the sign, Hensh, that's us.
Start loading up.

38:36.720 --> 38:40.304
I must ask you to remain indoors this evening.
Trooper Wilkins will guard you.

38:40.480 --> 38:44.826
Against what, may I ask?
Do you suppose there to be an enemy about?

38:45.000 --> 38:48.868
Of sorts, ma'am. We have word that the
smugglers intend to use your cove tonight.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.621
Where's your husband?

38:51.920 --> 38:54.104
He's in St Ives. He'll be back tomorrow.

38:54.280 --> 38:57.545
- Would you like a glass ofwine?
- Thank ye, no. I'm on duty.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.699
What is it that you want with my husband?

39:00.880 --> 39:02.507
What have we to do with this?

39:02.680 --> 39:07.583
Nothing, I hope, but since it's your land,
I think ye can hardly be as innocent as ye look.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.505
Why would you do it? Betray your own folk?

39:11.680 --> 39:15.138
What folk? Nobody did aught for me.
Folks only look to theirselves in this life.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.345
- By selling their friends?
- I done what I done.

39:17.520 --> 39:20.500
You don't have to like it
and 'ee don't be myjudge!

39:24.040 --> 39:25.268
(Chair legs clatter)

39:26.600 --> 39:33.028
My dearest uncle, for most of my life,
you have been both father and motherto me...

39:39.760 --> 39:40.988
(Poker clatters)

39:44.760 --> 39:50.141
Believe me, ma'am, for the favour
of your goodwill, I would pay a very high price.

39:51.160 --> 39:53.299
But none which involves a neglect of duty.

39:56.200 --> 39:57.906
And what should I do?

40:02.480 --> 40:05.301
I can ill spare Wilkins,
but you give me no choice.

40:09.600 --> 40:10.908
(Blade scrapes table)

40:15.480 --> 40:16.583
Urrgh!

40:22.000 --> 40:23.183
Charlie...

40:29.160 --> 40:30.422
(Groans)

41:00.760 --> 41:05.345
You mustn't risk coming ashore with us, Hensh.
Stay aboard till she docks at St Ann's.

41:05.520 --> 41:07.499
- Gladly. Good luck.
- Stay safe.

41:29.560 --> 41:31.141
(Owl hoots)

42:06.160 --> 42:09.982
Take a seat, ma'am. 'Twill be a long night
and you'll not wish to tire yourself.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.867
I'm sure I don't wish to be given orders
in my own house.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.826
Wish it or no, 'tis my orders we go by,

42:15.000 --> 42:17.946
so you'll kindly oblige me
by keeping where I can see you.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.463
DEMELZA: And what ifwe wish
to get some sleep?

42:20.640 --> 42:24.064
I must ask you to do so here, ma'am,
so I can keep an eye on you.

42:43.600 --> 42:44.862
Cap'n.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.579
(Waves splash against the oars)

43:53.640 --> 43:55.267
(Grunts)

44:16.320 --> 44:18.538
VERCOE: Wait till everything is offthe boat.

44:26.320 --> 44:27.708
Flemmo, take this.

44:27.880 --> 44:29.620
- Up there.
PAUL: Ted!

44:31.480 --> 44:33.027
Did you find your brother?

44:33.200 --> 44:34.428
- We did.
- Was he well?

44:36.280 --> 44:38.748
- Did he have aught to tell?
- To tell? Yes.

44:38.920 --> 44:40.547
Of any use? No.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.619
Ross, what's that?

44:47.120 --> 44:48.587
Ambush.

44:48.760 --> 44:50.227
Relaunch.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.867
- Relaunch!
- Come on!

44:52.040 --> 44:53.462
(Panicked shouting)

44:53.640 --> 44:55.540
- Relaunch!
- Come on!

44:55.720 --> 44:56.948
- Relaunch!
- Come on, boys!

44:57.120 --> 44:59.145
Go! Go! Go!

44:59.320 --> 45:00.901
- (Men shouting)
- Go!

45:01.080 --> 45:03.105
- Come on!
ROSS: Get in!

45:03.280 --> 45:05.180
Push!

45:05.360 --> 45:06.463
Go!

45:07.920 --> 45:10.104
ROSS: Get in!
- Push! Come on!

45:10.280 --> 45:11.542
Ross, let's go!

45:11.720 --> 45:14.188
- I'm gonna take my chances here.
- 'Ee'll never make it.

45:14.360 --> 45:16.703
Go! Row!

45:18.760 --> 45:19.863
Fire!

45:21.040 --> 45:23.258
- Halt in the name ofthe King!
VERCOE: Cut 'em off!

45:24.800 --> 45:26.427
- Cut 'em off!
- Halt!

45:26.600 --> 45:28.181
(Musket fire)

45:30.560 --> 45:32.460
None ofthat.
You know the captain's orders.

45:32.640 --> 45:35.746
I have a little boy upstairs. He'll be frightened.
I must bring him down.

45:35.920 --> 45:38.229
- I can't allow that.
- Do you make war on babies now?

45:39.280 --> 45:40.668
Get out of my way.

45:41.760 --> 45:43.739
- Is there a baby?
- Of course there is.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.019
Very well. But be quick about it.

45:48.480 --> 45:50.425
(Shouﬁng)

46:00.760 --> 46:02.307
(Musket fire)

46:03.720 --> 46:05.062
You!

46:24.760 --> 46:26.148
(Grunts)

46:45.520 --> 46:46.908
(Breathes heavily)

46:47.080 --> 46:48.707
- Demelza.
- Ross!

46:48.880 --> 46:49.949
I thought...

46:50.120 --> 46:53.100
- We need to get to the house.
- There's soldiers guarding it - McNeil.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.259
- Oh, damn it.
- Are you hurt?

46:55.440 --> 46:56.782
No, it's just a scratch.

46:56.960 --> 46:58.905
(Distant shouting)

46:59.080 --> 47:01.059
They're coming.

47:04.600 --> 47:07.023
Soldiers? At this time of night?

47:07.200 --> 47:09.145
There must be some unrest.

47:09.320 --> 47:13.302
Why does Ross not answer my notes?
Has he no care for us at all?

47:13.480 --> 47:15.505
He has his own family to protect.

47:15.680 --> 47:18.228
Then I must appeal for help elsewhere.

47:25.680 --> 47:28.342
Go in through the kitchen.
I must get to the cache.

47:28.520 --> 47:30.704
Through the side door.
I have a key. Make haste.

47:40.600 --> 47:42.022
- Where have you been?
- Upstairs.

47:42.200 --> 47:43.986
- How did you get down?
- By the back stairs.

47:44.160 --> 47:46.549
- You never mentioned...
- I'm here. Isn't that enough?

47:46.720 --> 47:48.699
(Rapid knocking at door)

47:49.800 --> 47:51.381
He's in the library.

47:55.160 --> 47:57.025
Where is Captain Poldark?

47:57.200 --> 47:59.862
- In St Ives, I believe.
- You believe wrong.

48:00.040 --> 48:02.099
I saw him not ten minutes ago.
Has he come in here?

48:02.280 --> 48:03.588
No-one has been in but you, sir.

48:03.760 --> 48:06.342
He's headed in this direction.
He'll be somewhere about.

48:06.520 --> 48:09.341
How dare you come breaking in here.
My husband will hear of it.

48:09.520 --> 48:13.104
And shortly, I trust. You will give us permission
to search the house?

48:13.280 --> 48:15.259
I most certainly will not.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.869
You've searched the cellars? No contraband?

48:19.040 --> 48:22.180
- I told you that Ross was in St Ives.
- I wish I believed you.

48:22.360 --> 48:25.067
Search the outhouses and the stables.
I'll take the library.

48:25.240 --> 48:29.028
- The library, it is sometimes locked.
- No doubt you have a key.

48:30.120 --> 48:32.099
(Door creaks)

48:34.880 --> 48:36.347
Over here.

48:38.560 --> 48:40.027
Bring light.

48:42.200 --> 48:44.179
- Here it is.
- Just like he said.

48:46.440 --> 48:48.021
Give me the pistol, man.

48:49.120 --> 48:50.985
Guns at the ready.

48:51.160 --> 48:52.627
Vercoe?

48:52.800 --> 48:54.381
Would you mind?

49:02.320 --> 49:03.787
More light!

49:20.080 --> 49:22.184
(Steady drizzle)

49:29.080 --> 49:30.945
Are you shivering, my precious?

49:31.120 --> 49:34.100
Perhaps we should go inside
before you catch a chill.

50:02.160 --> 50:05.823
- (Relieved sigh) They let you go.
- Finally. Now I must go to Caroline.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.503
- Pray God she'll understand.
- Of course she will.

50:08.680 --> 50:10.545
- And Ross?
- There's no sign of him.

50:10.720 --> 50:12.585
I cannot conceive where he would be.

50:12.760 --> 50:14.421
Not in the cache, at any rate.

50:15.520 --> 50:17.385
You won't forget us?

50:17.560 --> 50:18.822
Neven

50:20.000 --> 50:21.467
Yaah! Hup!

50:24.120 --> 50:25.587
(Sighs)

50:28.800 --> 50:30.267
(Door opens)

50:35.920 --> 50:37.899
Where's your father?

50:39.000 --> 50:40.467
Where is he?

50:40.640 --> 50:42.301
Where's your father, child?

50:42.480 --> 50:44.459
Never fear. We won't hurt 'ee.

50:46.640 --> 50:48.505
Numbers?

50:48.680 --> 50:51.581
He'll be counting his days
when I lay my hands on him.

50:57.320 --> 50:59.185
'Twas Charlie?

50:59.360 --> 51:01.339
- The informer?
- 'Twas.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.779
JUD: Right, let's get after him.

51:14.960 --> 51:16.746
I have a letter for you, sir.

51:26.800 --> 51:30.065
CAROLINE: Deaeright,
I have left for London with my uncle,

51:30.240 --> 51:33.824
a move which cannot surprise you
afterthe foasco of last night.

51:34.920 --> 51:39.266
It is better this way. Ever since we agreed
to elope, I have known of your struggle

51:39.440 --> 51:43.900
between your infatuation for me
and your real love - your patients.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.707
Now you need no longer worry
or give anything up.

51:48.800 --> 51:51.268
Except me. And that you have already done.

51:52.880 --> 51:54.745
So, farewell, Dwight.

51:54.920 --> 51:56.785
I shall never see you again.

51:56.960 --> 51:58.825
Your sincere friend,

51:59.000 --> 52:00.979
Caroline Penvenen.

52:10.880 --> 52:12.745
George, I've been worried out of my mind.

52:12.920 --> 52:15.024
- I haven't.
- There was a smuggling incident.

52:15.200 --> 52:18.226
- The military were out in force.
- A pity they've nothing better to do.

52:18.400 --> 52:21.619
Though I'm told they had their eye
on a bigger prize. Your nephew.

52:21.800 --> 52:24.462
- Ross? _ _
- I'm not clear as to his preCIse involvement.

52:24.640 --> 52:26.505
- Merely that he was involved.
- Stuff!

52:26.680 --> 52:29.103
It baffles me why he considers himself
above the law,

52:29.280 --> 52:34.183
exempt from the duty we law-abiding citizens
pay on legally-imported goods.

52:34.360 --> 52:35.827
- Piffle!
- Is it certain?

52:36.000 --> 52:38.059
As it stands. He's disappeared. So...

52:39.080 --> 52:40.707
On the run from justice.

52:40.880 --> 52:45.863
Oh, no doubt he'll live to fight
and offend another day, but, still...

52:46.040 --> 52:49.020
I pity anyone who must depend on such a man.

53:03.440 --> 53:07.149
He must have made it to the library.
The table had moved and the rug.

53:08.240 --> 53:11.027
- But if he'd no time to open the cache...
- Where could he be?

53:11.200 --> 53:13.464
- (Distant talking)
- Soldiers!

53:18.640 --> 53:20.824
The captain says to move out.

53:40.600 --> 53:43.467
JUD: So was he killed
or did he do the job hisself?

53:44.560 --> 53:46.266
I reckon we'll never know.

53:46.880 --> 53:48.541
(Grunts)

54:14.160 --> 54:16.139
(Door opens)

54:17.240 --> 54:19.105
Mistress Poldark was reassured?

54:19.280 --> 54:20.622
I believe so.

54:20.800 --> 54:22.267
(Clink of glasses)

54:22.440 --> 54:26.422
I wonder she does not remarry.
A husband could offer her more protection.

54:26.600 --> 54:28.227
He could. (Pours drink)

54:28.400 --> 54:31.062
And he will. (Replaces stopper in decanter)

54:51.800 --> 54:53.665
His hand was all bloody.

54:53.840 --> 54:56.024
I can't stop thinking about it. What...?

54:57.040 --> 55:00.908
What if it was worse than he thought? Or what if
he's lying bleeding to death somewhere?

55:01.080 --> 55:03.059
Hush, maid, don't think such a thing.

55:35.800 --> 55:37.779
(Plank scrapes floor)

55:59.360 --> 56:03.342
DEMELZA: With your heart mating

56:06.360 --> 56:12.742
I'd hold a finger to my tongue

56:13.840 --> 56:18.539
I'd hold a finger waiting

56:20.160 --> 56:25.746
My heart is sore, until itjoins in song

56:27.240 --> 56:32.223
With your heart mating

56:41.280 --> 56:42.542
Ross!
