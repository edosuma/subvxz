00:10.011 --> 00:11.585
There's only one hope left.

00:11.587 --> 00:13.086
Oh, it's targeted therapy.

00:13.088 --> 00:14.662
It could buy my mother years.

03:15.437 --> 03:16.645
it's this one.

03:16.647 --> 03:19.031
Okay, well,
a private practice in Buckhead

03:19.033 --> 03:21.758
offered me three years
and childcare

03:21.760 --> 03:23.619
and I make my own hours.

03:25.021 --> 03:27.873
You're impossibly talented,

03:27.875 --> 03:30.100
and doling out B12 shots

03:30.102 --> 03:33.128
for hangovers, I mean...

03:34.790 --> 03:36.364
And that impact is minuscule

03:36.366 --> 03:38.533
compared to
what you can do here.

the sentiment, but...

Okay. (stammers)
Well, so what about this?

we're stretched so thin,

03:46.560 --> 03:50.062

and just see how it feels?

03:50.064 --> 03:52.138

is to hold me hostage

03:52.140 --> 03:54.233
-until I agree to come back?

03:54.235 --> 03:55.959

Listen, brother, I need
your help with a patient.

That's impressive.

04:03.727 --> 04:05.059
It's about my mother.

04:05.061 --> 04:06.620
She's back in the hospital.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.176

04:23.079 --> 04:25.264
-Here you go.
-Uh, thank you.

04:28.102 --> 04:31.344
Obviously, you... you knew
I was coming, right?

04:31.346 --> 04:33.087
AJ told me.

04:33.089 --> 04:36.016
I hope it's okay that I'm here.

04:36.018 --> 04:39.444
I'm, uh... (chuckles)

04:39.446 --> 04:41.505
I'm not the same person
I was years ago.

04:41.507 --> 04:42.839
Good.

04:42.841 --> 04:45.842
And congratulations
on getting through med school.

04:45.844 --> 04:47.661
That's no small feat.

04:49.031 --> 04:52.532
Uh, I mean,
it wasn't that hard. (scoffs)

04:52.534 --> 04:54.293
For me, anyway.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.703
Well, maybe you haven't changed
that much after all.

04:56.705 --> 04:57.963
I see you're still suffering

04:57.965 --> 05:00.132
from that dangerously
high opinion of yourself.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.692
(huffs) It's incurable, so...

05:02.694 --> 05:03.719
(laughs)

05:05.121 --> 05:07.531
Can I ask you
a personal question?

05:07.533 --> 05:08.882
No.

05:08.884 --> 05:10.867
Obviously, you don't seem
to despise me anymore, so...

05:10.869 --> 05:13.127
-I never despised you.
-No, you-you definitely did.

05:13.129 --> 05:14.721
Look, Trevor,
it is inappropriate

05:14.723 --> 05:16.723
for you to tell me
what I feel or don't feel

05:16.725 --> 05:18.391
about you or anything else.

05:18.393 --> 05:19.893
(chuckles) I knew it.

05:19.895 --> 05:22.562
Huh. You've been in therapy.
You're setting your boundary.

05:22.564 --> 05:24.472
-Kudos.
-Okay.

05:24.474 --> 05:25.565
God.

05:25.567 --> 05:29.069
Look, we're gonna need
to set some rules.

05:29.071 --> 05:31.163
No one here needs to know
that we're related,

05:31.165 --> 05:32.831
that you're my biological son.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.482
Agreed.
It's none of their business.

05:34.484 --> 05:35.559
-Mm-hmm.
-And?

05:35.561 --> 05:37.243
Try really hard
not to be an ass.

05:37.245 --> 05:40.113
-Good advice. Anything else?
-Just one more.

05:40.115 --> 05:42.591
Don't ever ask me for money.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.185
And we're positive
this isn't a resurgence

05:53.187 --> 05:54.853
of Carol's lung cancer, right?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.355
Well, according
to her oncologist,

05:56.357 --> 05:59.340
all tests show
zero cancer progression.

05:59.342 --> 06:02.027
That means her targeted
immunotherapy's working.

06:02.029 --> 06:06.106
She cycled through several drugs
these last few years.

06:06.108 --> 06:07.591
You know, I honestly thought

06:07.593 --> 06:09.759
we'd reached the end of the road
till we found this one.

06:09.761 --> 06:12.537
Now, I know it's not a cure,
but, uh, you'd have me fooled.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.039
That's good.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.117
If it's not the cancer, it's
likely something we can fix.

06:17.119 --> 06:20.194
-Hey, Carol.
-Oh.

06:20.196 --> 06:23.531
(laughs) AJ, you didn't tell me

06:23.533 --> 06:27.961
we were having
a VIP guest visit.

06:27.963 --> 06:29.388
Ah, careful, Ma.

06:29.390 --> 06:32.632
You know, flattery goes
to his head, like brain freeze.

06:32.634 --> 06:34.375
(laughs)

06:34.377 --> 06:36.302
It's good to see you again.
How you feeling?

06:36.304 --> 06:38.897
Uh, I've been better.
(chuckles softly)

06:38.899 --> 06:40.715
Sad to hear
you had left Chastain.

06:40.717 --> 06:43.460
I hope this means
you'll be back for good.

06:43.462 --> 06:45.311
Yeah, well, plenty of time
to talk about me.

06:45.313 --> 06:47.388
I want to hear about you.
Tell me, what's going on?

06:47.390 --> 06:50.075
Well...

06:50.077 --> 06:52.894
I've never been so tired.

06:52.896 --> 06:55.822
Can't make it through<i> The Crown</i>

This woman loves Princess Diana.

06:58.067 --> 07:00.143
(Carol laughs)

07:00.145 --> 07:03.755
Then I started losing weight,

07:03.757 --> 07:06.650
and that had me worried.

07:06.652 --> 07:08.927
-Maybe an infection?
-AUSTIN: That's what I thought,

07:08.929 --> 07:11.763
but she's not responding
to any antibiotics.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.990
Could be bacterial resistance

07:13.992 --> 07:16.176
or an... atypical infection.

07:16.178 --> 07:19.086
You know what? Let me get
some labs, run some tests.

07:19.088 --> 07:21.831
Don't you worry.
We'll get you some answers.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.442

07:57.536 --> 07:58.626
Dan, good morning.

08:06.394 --> 08:08.469
What is the first thing
that we do?

08:08.471 --> 08:09.729
Oh, I hope it's all right,
I threw together

08:09.881 --> 08:11.305
a little PowerPoint
for a possible plan of action.

08:11.307 --> 08:12.732
I love the initiative,
Dr. Bonner,

08:12.734 --> 08:15.327
-but before that, what's first?
-Get smashed.

08:17.222 --> 08:18.997
It's a mnemonic. Gallstones,

08:18.999 --> 08:21.241
ethanol, trauma, steroids,
mumps, autoimmune,

08:21.243 --> 08:23.818
scorpion sting,
hypercalcemia, ERCP

08:23.820 --> 08:25.895
and drugs.

08:25.897 --> 08:28.322
No, the first thing
we do is listen.

08:28.324 --> 08:30.416
To the patient, and then to me.

08:30.418 --> 08:34.328
HUNDLEY:

Okay.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.758
Time to suit up.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.435

08:47.252 --> 08:48.918
DEVON:
That's Trevor Daniels.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.195
You know him?

08:50.197 --> 08:52.255
He made quite the impression
when he tried to lecture

08:52.257 --> 08:55.592
the doctors on how to treat
his junkie girlfriend.

08:55.594 --> 08:57.427
Now I guess
he's a doctor himself.

08:57.429 --> 09:01.114
Well, he's an M.D.,
not a doctor, yet.

-Yes.
-And, um...

09:11.200 --> 09:13.610
Brooks, you're with Dr. Feldman.

09:13.612 --> 09:15.703
Are you sure, Coach? I know the
upper extremity neurovascular

09:15.705 --> 09:17.163
-anatomy by heart, so...
-They've got it handled,

09:17.165 --> 09:18.448
but there's a woman in bay five

09:18.450 --> 09:19.724
who needs her blood work drawn.
Go help her.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.227
Seriously? That guy's hand's
hanging on by a thread,

09:22.229 --> 09:24.287
and you trust
Thing One and Thing Two?

09:24.289 --> 09:26.398
Your patient isn't
any less important

09:26.400 --> 09:28.567

kind enough to let him listen

33:14.976 --> 33:17.160
while you and I talk about
the future.

33:19.814 --> 33:22.648
Of course.

33:22.650 --> 33:25.910
AJ was an intern once.

33:25.912 --> 33:27.337

to talk about.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.396
I've made my choice.

33:28.490 --> 33:30.323
And I will make that happen
for you.

33:30.325 --> 33:32.551
I just want to help you
understand what you're choosing.

33:33.995 --> 33:36.013
If either choice
ends up killing me,

33:36.015 --> 33:37.589
what difference does it make?

33:37.591 --> 33:39.433
That's a good question.

33:41.094 --> 33:42.561
It makes a big difference.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.414
If-- just if--

33:46.416 --> 33:48.266
we stop the immunotherapy

33:48.268 --> 33:50.861
to protect you from the symptoms
you're feeling now,

33:50.863 --> 33:52.529
you will regain your energy.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.532
Fevers, headaches,
they'll go away.

33:55.534 --> 33:59.110
You'll be able to get back
to the life you were living.

33:59.112 --> 34:02.597
Until the cancer comes back.

34:02.599 --> 34:04.266
Correct.

34:04.268 --> 34:06.601
But you don't know how soon
your cancer will come back,

34:06.603 --> 34:07.693
if at all.

34:07.695 --> 34:10.530
You may have more life
than you realize.

34:10.532 --> 34:12.549
You can travel,
you can exercise.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.719
But when it's back,

34:15.721 --> 34:20.115
it could return anywhere,
in any part of my body.

like this.

34:22.786 --> 34:24.603

with that pain.

Now...

...if you continue
the immunotherapy,

34:33.964 --> 34:38.057
that's not
a painless choice either.
