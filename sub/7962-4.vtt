MAC:
<i> Drop the bluff, Dee.</i>

00:07.076 --> 00:08.743
<i> No one believes</i>
<i> you're in an actual movie.</i>

00:08.745 --> 00:10.544
You guys are gonna feel
hella stupid when you see me

00:10.546 --> 00:12.580
acting in a feature film.
"Hella." Are we
saying "hella" now?

00:12.582 --> 00:14.115
'Cause I like it.
No, we're not saying
"hella," okay?

00:14.117 --> 00:16.217
No.
Nobody's saying
"hella" anymore.

00:16.219 --> 00:18.119
I never really got to say it.
"Hella" came and went.
Me, neither.

00:18.121 --> 00:19.720
Dee, can we watch
something else?

00:19.722 --> 00:21.789
Can we watch, like,
a superhero movie or something?

00:21.791 --> 00:23.724
This is such a waste of our...

00:23.726 --> 00:26.294
Oh, that's a nice opening shot.
Symmetrical vista.

00:26.296 --> 00:27.695
It's beautiful.

00:27.697 --> 00:29.964
MAC: Directed by
Pedro Vyes. Who's he?

00:29.966 --> 00:31.799
He's, like, this foreign
art house director.

00:31.801 --> 00:34.702
Oh. Ooh...
Foreign director.
Very impressive.

00:34.704 --> 00:36.070
Okay, you guys, be quiet.
This is my scene.

00:36.072 --> 00:38.072
Pretty early for a whiskey.

00:38.074 --> 00:40.074
Or pretty late.

00:40.076 --> 00:42.076
Why don't you make it
a double.

00:42.078 --> 00:45.279
Oh, yeah? A little hair
of the dog that bit you?

00:45.281 --> 00:47.048
(chuckles)
MAC:
<i> Yeah, Dee,</i>

00:47.050 --> 00:48.649
I got to hand it to you.
Y-You've been talking

00:48.651 --> 00:52.486
about doing this for years,
and... Is that Richard Grieco?

00:54.290 --> 00:56.290
Hi.

00:56.292 --> 00:58.326
Aw, Grieco. I love that
guy. Where's he been?

00:58.328 --> 01:00.561
Richard Grieco
is in an art house movie?

01:00.563 --> 01:03.264
That seems odd.
That's a little strange.
Yeah, it's a little stra...

01:03.266 --> 01:05.499
But, you know, they-they always
got to get some kind of a name

01:05.501 --> 01:08.269
in order to finance the mo...
Oh, now he's being blown.
DEE: Right.

01:08.271 --> 01:11.739
(gang exclaiming, laughing)

01:11.741 --> 01:13.741
Okay. Now-now this makes sense.

01:13.743 --> 01:16.310
So, Dee,
you clearly made a porn.
This is a porno!

01:16.312 --> 01:18.446
What? No? It's not
a porn. You guys,

01:18.448 --> 01:21.449
the-the foreigners, they have
a much more evolved view of sex.

01:21.451 --> 01:22.750
This is... this is art.

01:22.752 --> 01:24.151

01:25.989 --> 01:27.621
Dee, what channel
did you order this from?

01:27.623 --> 01:28.489
Cinemax.

01:28.491 --> 01:29.924
ALL:
Cinemax?!

01:29.926 --> 01:32.159
Cinemax doesn't
make art.

01:32.161 --> 01:35.596
You guys, Pedro is-is
an edgy, foreign director.

01:35.598 --> 01:36.664
Where's he from?

01:36.666 --> 01:38.599
Puerto Rico.
Oh!

01:38.601 --> 01:39.800
Puerto Rico?
Puerto Rico?
Puerto Rico!

01:39.802 --> 01:41.502
MAC:
Oh, man...

01:41.504 --> 01:44.305
Dee, you made a Skinemax flick
with a Puerto Rican pervert.

01:44.307 --> 01:46.607
Congratulations. Good thing
you got us all together.

01:46.609 --> 01:49.110
Listen, hey, I did
not make a smut film.

01:49.112 --> 01:50.845
GRIECO:
Gobble that cock.

01:50.847 --> 01:52.279
(laughter)

02:17.240 --> 02:18.739
MAC: Now, why is Grieco
resorting to Skinemax?

02:18.741 --> 02:20.408
He's got a great career.
He's doing fine.

02:20.410 --> 02:21.842
Actually, it makes sense.
I mean,

02:21.844 --> 02:23.744
erotic films
are very, very in right now.

02:23.746 --> 02:25.579
I mean, Grieco probably didn't
realize he was doing a porn.

02:25.581 --> 02:26.914
I think he thought
he was doing the next

02:26.916 --> 02:28.349
<i> Fifty Shades</i>
<i> of Grey</i> or whatever.

02:28.351 --> 02:29.350
I mean, it's a...
it's a fine line

02:29.352 --> 02:30.751
these days between art and smut.

02:30.753 --> 02:32.053
It really is.
Art's a tricky thing.

02:32.055 --> 02:34.155
The whole art world
is bullshit nowadays.

02:34.157 --> 02:36.557
I mean, like, anything can be
considered art. I'll bet you

02:36.559 --> 02:39.326
Charlie's doodlings could be
considered art by some people.

02:39.328 --> 02:42.763
Well, that's 'cause my drawings
<i> are</i> art.

02:42.765 --> 02:45.099
You're not an artist, dude.
You're drawing with chalk.

02:45.101 --> 02:47.368
No, I'm drawing with marker
and, like, pen and stuff.

02:47.370 --> 02:48.602
I'm just eating the chalk.

02:48.604 --> 02:50.037
Charlie, don't eat chalk.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.038
Well, it settles my stomach.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.173
My stomach's a little...

02:52.175 --> 02:53.541
If your stomach hurts,
eat a Tums.

02:53.543 --> 02:55.209
What's the difference?
One is chalk!

02:55.211 --> 02:56.444
Well, I don't like
wasting Tums.

02:56.446 --> 02:58.112
Tums is very good
to draw with.

02:58.114 --> 02:59.580
This maniac
is an artist?

02:59.582 --> 03:01.082
I'll bet you
if I hung one

03:01.084 --> 03:02.349
of Charlie's doodles
in a modern art gallery,

03:02.351 --> 03:03.584
people would not know
the difference.

03:03.586 --> 03:05.352
Mm. No. No, I disagree.

03:05.354 --> 03:07.588
No, art has to come
from a more meaningful place.

03:07.590 --> 03:09.223
It can't just be silly nonsense.

03:09.225 --> 03:10.524
I mean,
take my erotic memoirs,

03:10.526 --> 03:12.526
for example.
(chuckles)

03:12.528 --> 03:15.062
Now, that was art.
That was smut.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.964
No, dude, what I do is art.
And you know what else?

03:16.966 --> 03:19.133
I think I should film it.
Yeah.

03:19.135 --> 03:21.969
I mean, guys, I'd be a fool not
to ride this erotic tidal wave

03:21.971 --> 03:23.804
our culture seems to be on,
film it,

03:23.806 --> 03:26.307
do the next<i> Fifty Shades</i>
<i> of Grey,</i> my style, you know?

03:26.309 --> 03:28.409
My film would be real,
it would be tasteful,

03:28.411 --> 03:30.044
it would be...
it would be subtle.

03:30.046 --> 03:31.812
It wouldn't be some goddamn
Puerto Rican smut.

03:31.814 --> 03:34.949
I'm down to try this, like,
art gallery idea of yours.

03:34.951 --> 03:37.051
What do you think
Grieco would do?

03:37.053 --> 03:38.986
He wouldn't eat
chalk.

03:46.329 --> 03:48.829
Yes, but I just don't understand
why you're choosing

03:48.831 --> 03:50.631
to dress like
Richard Grieco.

03:50.633 --> 03:52.933
Well, because he's a cool bro
and I'm a cool bro.

03:52.935 --> 03:55.002
I just want to do a Grieco
thing. I'm vibing with it.

03:55.004 --> 03:56.937

Uh-huh.
And, uh...

16:30.826 --> 16:32.926
Oh, here we have
the artist himself.

16:32.928 --> 16:35.328
This is Rickety Cricket.
Hey-o.

16:35.330 --> 16:38.765
Wow.
Yeah, he literally
has the worst life imaginable.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.233
(laughing):
He ain't lying.

16:40.235 --> 16:41.668
So now you got some perspective

16:41.670 --> 16:43.403
and some context.
Uh-huh.

16:43.405 --> 16:45.739
And like a story or whatever
it is that you people need,

16:45.741 --> 16:47.240
so...
Uh-huh.

16:47.242 --> 16:48.842
We don't have
to talk numbers right now,

16:48.844 --> 16:50.577
but I feel like it should be...
DEE: Hey, guys.

16:50.579 --> 16:53.380
I figured this art opening
would be the perfect place

16:53.382 --> 16:56.449
to premiere
my directorial debut.

16:56.451 --> 16:57.918
No, Dee, absolutely not.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.953
That's a hard "no."
MAC:
Yeah.

16:59.955 --> 17:02.289
(piano plays gentle melody)

17:02.291 --> 17:04.791
(orchestra joins in)

17:18.140 --> 17:20.073
DENNIS:
<i> Oh, come on. There were...</i>

17:20.075 --> 17:21.942
No, Dee.
This is ridiculous.

17:21.944 --> 17:24.377
♪ ♪

17:39.294 --> 17:42.462
(orchestra plays upbeat,
fast-paced music)

17:44.232 --> 17:46.633
Hey, hoser, remember when
I raped you in the library?

17:46.635 --> 17:50.503
Hoser, hoser, hoser, hoser,
hoser, hoser, hoser...

17:50.505 --> 17:52.639
Okay, thank you. Thank you very
much. I'm sorry. That was, uh...

17:52.641 --> 17:54.674
That's not part
of the, uh, whole thing.

17:54.676 --> 17:56.743
It's very disturbing.
It's very avant-garde.

17:56.745 --> 17:59.412
Mm-hmm.
What do
you think it's all worth?

17:59.414 --> 18:01.581
Good question.
Ango, what do you think?

18:01.583 --> 18:03.516
Millions.

18:03.518 --> 18:05.852
I'd trade my
limbs for it.

18:05.854 --> 18:09.622
Well, the market is dictated
by what people will pay, so...

18:09.624 --> 18:12.325
Well, right, but how much
are<i> you</i> willing to pay for it?

18:12.327 --> 18:13.927
Me?
Yeah.

18:13.929 --> 18:16.029
(laughs)
Oh, no, no.

18:16.031 --> 18:19.099
I'm really not interested
in buying anything.

18:19.101 --> 18:20.667
But you own
an art gallery.

18:20.669 --> 18:22.135
Oh, no. Oh.

18:22.137 --> 18:23.703
I<i> rent</i> an art gallery,

18:23.705 --> 18:26.006
or more accurately,
my parents rent one for me.

18:26.008 --> 18:28.141
What?!

18:28.143 --> 18:30.610
So that painting I bought
from you was worthless?

18:30.612 --> 18:32.012
Of course not.

18:32.014 --> 18:33.546
It meant something to you.

18:33.548 --> 18:35.815
It's worth
exactly what you paid.

18:35.817 --> 18:38.184
I want to
sell it back.
Okay.

18:38.186 --> 18:39.986
In that exchange,
it would only be worth

18:39.988 --> 18:43.523
what<i> I</i> would pay for it,
which is, again, um, nothing.

18:43.525 --> 18:44.958
I-I don't get it.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.459
When is stuff art?

18:46.461 --> 18:49.229
Uh, hey, guys,
guys, um, if I may,

18:49.231 --> 18:51.698
I think I can
sum this all up.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.066
You see, art

18:53.068 --> 18:55.235
is an ambiguous thing, yeah?

18:55.237 --> 18:57.737
Yeah, just because you make
some art, it doesn't mean

18:57.739 --> 18:59.806
that you're an artist.

18:59.808 --> 19:02.475
But, also, it<i> does</i> mean
you're an artist.

19:02.477 --> 19:04.511
But does it mean
that that art

19:04.513 --> 19:06.913
is good art?

19:06.915 --> 19:10.750
Is art good just because
the right people say it's good?

19:10.752 --> 19:13.219
Yes. Yes.

19:13.221 --> 19:15.021
That's-that's how it works.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.890
Yeah, but keep in mind,
you know,

19:16.892 --> 19:18.725
a lot of modern art is...
is trash.

19:18.727 --> 19:20.226
I mean, it's shitty.
It's not...

19:20.228 --> 19:21.761
You know, it's not good.
It's terrible.

19:21.763 --> 19:23.730
You know? And yet,
it's a fine line

19:23.732 --> 19:27.033
between Van Gogh and Van Damme,

19:27.035 --> 19:29.002
you know,
between Depp and Grieco,

19:29.004 --> 19:31.871
between Banksy and Charlie,

19:31.873 --> 19:34.374
that makes it very difficult to
determine what's good art.

19:34.376 --> 19:35.775
You know, what's high art?

19:35.777 --> 19:37.444
What has worth?
What has meaning?

19:37.446 --> 19:38.945
Yeah?

19:38.947 --> 19:40.780
But if one thing

19:40.782 --> 19:42.849
has become abundantly clear
to me today--

19:42.851 --> 19:46.219
and it should be to all of you,
as well--

19:46.221 --> 19:50.190
is that I wasn't raped.

19:52.027 --> 19:54.194
We had a good time, she and I.

19:54.196 --> 19:57.097
Yeah. It was a...
it was a two-way road.

19:57.099 --> 19:59.666
The whole thing was... mutual.

20:01.303 --> 20:05.105
And the woman in no way
looked like Rick Moranis.

20:05.107 --> 20:07.073
You know?

20:07.075 --> 20:10.376
She totally did. I remember
her. Remember her?
Yeah.

20:10.378 --> 20:12.545
Um...
Real dog.
I wouldn't even sleep with her.

20:48.517 --> 20:50.083
(trumpet playing off-key)

20:50.085 --> 20:51.518
<i> Brown.</i>
