WEBVTT

00:36.036 --> 00:38.706
ALL CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, CASES

00:38.789 --> 00:40.958
AND SETTINGS DEPICTED
ARE FICTIONAL

02:12.800 --> 02:14.969
Still don't carry umbrellas with you?

02:25.145 --> 02:28.732
I didn't see your email in time.

02:32.528 --> 02:35.739
That's what I thought.
I'm sure you were busy.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.452
Sorry for being so late.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.426
Pour me one too.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.639
I wanted to buy you something nicer.

03:00.723 --> 03:02.308
This is what I like.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.186
I just want to buy you better food.

03:07.146 --> 03:09.690
Who knows when I'll get to
treat you out again.

03:12.902 --> 03:14.737
Are you really leaving Korea?

03:16.947 --> 03:17.948
Yeah.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.536
Why do you have to go overseas
to make money?

03:23.162 --> 03:27.041
Earning money at the risk of jail time
means there's no future here.

03:28.042 --> 03:33.213
Unless you suck up to those with power,
it's hard to make real money here.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.845
Anyway, I won't get to see you
at your swearing-in ceremony.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.056
That's a shame.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.063
Here. My gift to you.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.440
What's this?

03:53.317 --> 03:58.322
Use this to sign papers
incriminating the bad guys, okay?

04:01.784 --> 04:02.910
Can't you stay?

04:04.912 --> 04:05.913
What?

04:08.415 --> 04:10.209
I liked having you around.

04:11.085 --> 04:14.630
Mom laughed often,
and the house felt lively.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.469
Can't you just stay?

04:22.972 --> 04:25.683
Well, the Internet's around everywhere.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.644
If something happens, send me an email.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.523
You don't have to tell me
when good things happen,

04:32.606 --> 04:35.734
but when bad things do,
tell me right away.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.070
You understand?

04:43.742 --> 04:44.743
Fine.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.413
Stay healthy, wherever you go.

04:47.997 --> 04:50.457
Come back once you make enough.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.085
All right.

04:53.836 --> 04:54.878
Will do.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.527
I live alone, so it's a bit messy.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.279
Just a minute.

05:20.946 --> 05:21.947
Okay.

06:07.159 --> 06:09.620
HEAD HONCHO MYUNG IN-JU
WHO'S BEHIND HIM?

06:23.425 --> 06:24.551
Have some tea.

06:25.344 --> 06:26.345
Sure.

06:28.514 --> 06:29.515
Thanks.

06:31.350 --> 06:34.228
You've been living like this
all this time?

06:36.313 --> 06:37.314
Why?

06:38.357 --> 06:40.484
This place is too big for one person.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.655
And what kind of bed is that?

06:45.614 --> 06:47.950
The heart weakens
if the body is too comfortable.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.160
Wow. You are so hard-core.

06:54.331 --> 06:57.876
This fight isn't for you to fight alone.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.462
Your mom was like family to me.

07:01.964 --> 07:04.842
You and I are on the same team.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.847
You haven't changed.
I've changed quite a bit.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.017
There's something you need to know.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.526
The real reason your mom passed?

07:28.532 --> 07:32.035
BLUENET CEO YOON HYE-RIN
ARRESTED ON BRIBERY CHARGES

07:37.207 --> 07:39.585
Doesn't looking at this stuff all night
scare you?

07:39.668 --> 07:43.338
I get my salary from people's taxes,
so I can stare at that stuff.

07:43.422 --> 07:46.133
-What time is it?
-7:30 a.m. Drink this.

07:46.925 --> 07:50.304
-Geez, I want coffee in the morning.
-Damn it, girl.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.390
You complain
even when I give you healthy stuff.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.811
I'm visiting your office in the morning.
Let's have lunch.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.354
The prosecution? For what?

07:59.438 --> 08:01.648
Witness investigation about the tech fund.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.318
Attorney Jung said it'd be over quickly.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.487
Give me a call,
but I might not pick up if I'm busy.

08:07.571 --> 08:11.783
Hey, busy or not, can't you find the time
to have lunch with your mom?

08:14.036 --> 08:17.164
DESPITE INVESTIGATION,
GENERAL SON GETS HIGHEST RATING

08:17.247 --> 08:19.249
A cut into the shoulder.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.710
A cut into the side.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.756
A cut here, a cut there.
Something's not adding up.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.467
Oh my goodness.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.094
What is this?

08:31.178 --> 08:32.512
Apologies, sir.

08:37.476 --> 08:38.685
Wow.

08:39.269 --> 08:42.022
Miss Prosecutor uses a pen like a knife.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.901
-I'm sorry if I startled you.
-No, it's nothing.

08:47.277 --> 08:51.031
Please capture those who wield knives
and give them the punishment they deserve.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.581
Hello, sir.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.459
Let's go.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.713
Oh, this was going up.

09:13.679 --> 09:17.391
I heard that my mom had been arrested
during the witness investigation,

09:17.474 --> 09:19.309
so I ran over to Special Investigations.

09:25.691 --> 09:27.526
-Sir, what is this?
-You can't be here.

09:27.609 --> 09:30.320
Let her be. Miss Park is our family too.

09:31.446 --> 09:34.157
This was a witness interrogation
about a tech fund,

09:34.241 --> 09:35.867
but you're arresting her for bribery?

09:35.951 --> 09:37.452
The warrant came through.

09:37.536 --> 09:40.956
I saw that warrant.
All the evidence was circumstantial!

09:41.039 --> 09:44.001
Okay, okay. Got it. Could you leave us?

09:46.837 --> 09:48.547
First off, calm down.

09:56.722 --> 10:00.058
You know I can't reveal case files
in an ongoing investigation.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.477
Take a look.

10:04.396 --> 10:08.400
Your mother and the general were
a well-known couple during college.

10:08.483 --> 10:09.693
Did you know that?

10:09.776 --> 10:11.987
What does that have to do with this case?

10:12.070 --> 10:15.532
Nothing, legally speaking.
But what if this picture gets out?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.827
Including the reporters,
the whole country will babble about this.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.040
Is this about General Son
running for provincial governorship?

10:23.123 --> 10:26.209
If we don't respond to his threat,
he'll get us first.

10:26.918 --> 10:29.963
"Us"? Who is "us," exactly?

10:30.047 --> 10:31.923
Don't play coy with me.

10:32.007 --> 10:36.136
The senior secretary for civil affairs
ordered this, so we're going all the way.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.556
This is prosecutorial misconduct.
It's illegal.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.434
-Prosecutorial misconduct, sure--
-Doing this when you know--

10:42.517 --> 10:43.977
Hey, Park Joon-gyeong!

10:45.771 --> 10:48.190
You know better. Why are you whining?

10:48.774 --> 10:52.778
If we decide to dig deep, do you think
your mother and her company will be safe?

10:55.155 --> 10:58.992
You're smart, so you should know.
There's still a way around this.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.334
Only you can save your mother.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.213
Don't be rash.

11:23.225 --> 11:26.478
Special Investigations prosecutors fight
against great evil, or so they say.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.605
But not Hwang Gi-seok.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.524
He's a businessman.

11:31.149 --> 11:34.486
He offers non-negotiable deals
with his prosecutorial authority.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.157
I too took his deal.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.247
For my mother.

11:55.507 --> 11:58.343
I fabricated evidence, as Hwang wanted.

11:58.427 --> 11:59.845
YOON HYE-RIN, BLUENET CEO

11:59.928 --> 12:03.557
The accusations made against me
prior to this election

12:03.640 --> 12:05.267
are categorically false.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.978
Although nothing has been
revealed objectively,

12:08.061 --> 12:10.021
after much deliberation,

12:10.105 --> 12:14.443
I have decided to drop out
of this election.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.114
GENERAL SON DROPS OUT

12:19.197 --> 12:21.199
General Son eventually gave up
the election.

12:25.287 --> 12:28.582
Prosecution has failed to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt

12:28.665 --> 12:30.917
the defendant's guilt
on the bribery charge.

12:32.169 --> 12:33.753
I thereby declare the defendantâ€¦

12:34.546 --> 12:35.797
not guilty.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.930
We're happy for you.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.433
Thanks for your hard work.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.192
Hwang kept his promise.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.791
The acquittal awarded by the court today

13:12.709 --> 13:14.628
marks the beginning of a new fight.

13:15.712 --> 13:19.674
We are going to expose the truth
behind this prosecutorial misconduct.

13:19.758 --> 13:22.636
So Mrs. Yoon and I,

13:22.719 --> 13:25.055
we will fight to the end.

13:25.138 --> 13:29.142
Once Mom was freed,
she and General Son sought the truth

13:29.226 --> 13:31.269
because it was an unfair arrest.

13:32.687 --> 13:33.688
Yes.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.441
Your mother would do that.

13:37.692 --> 13:38.818
But thenâ€¦

13:39.986 --> 13:41.905
Hwang made a move first.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.949
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

13:44.032 --> 13:48.328
Use this to sign papers
that will incriminate the bad guys, okay?

14:15.105 --> 14:16.565
Miss Park Joon-gyeong.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.609
We're from
the Supreme Prosecutors' office.

14:19.693 --> 14:20.986
We begin the interrogation

14:21.069 --> 14:25.031
for forgery of private documents
and obstruction of justice.

14:25.824 --> 14:27.909
Did you forge these documents

14:29.786 --> 14:32.080
that you handed over
to Special Investigations?

14:40.046 --> 14:42.257
Your daughter did everything for you.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.469
Now she'll be robbed of her entire life.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.565
Then why did your mother die?

14:59.983 --> 15:02.485
-It was because of me.
-How was it because of you?

15:06.072 --> 15:07.407
Fine.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.034
Their sins are greater.

15:12.245 --> 15:16.416
This was Mom's last message
to General Son.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.210
General Son.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.672
No, Seung-jin. It's me.

15:26.635 --> 15:27.886
It's raining.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.805
I remember the cheap rice wine

15:31.640 --> 15:35.143
we drank at the store near the dorms
after the student demonstrations.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.273
At the time,

15:41.691 --> 15:44.235
we thought we could change the world.

15:45.570 --> 15:49.491
But now that time has passed,
I realize the world has changed us.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.250
I'm the one who forgedâ€¦

16:01.711 --> 16:03.254
the bribery document.

16:06.341 --> 16:08.551
Forgive me for old times' sake, huh?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.472
I'm sorry.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.017
I'll take all the blame.

17:11.156 --> 17:12.574
Those sons of bitches.

17:16.244 --> 17:18.455
Let me handle them like the dogs they are.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.251
I'll throw them into the gutters.

17:28.339 --> 17:32.135
They're trying to cover Tae-chun's case
with an arrest for Kim Seong-tae.

17:34.929 --> 17:38.850
I have something to take them down,
both Chairman Myung and CEO Oh.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.185
Leave it to me.

17:40.894 --> 17:44.773
They can't be dealt with by law anyway.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.403
Yong.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.616
I'm going to fight.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.328
No matter how steep the price,
I'll fight till the end.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.247
Anyone on Hwang's side is an enemy.

18:02.290 --> 18:06.336
Even if it's your nephew or your family.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.476
Have you not gone home yet?

18:25.730 --> 18:29.150
-Do you know who that is?
-Attorney Lee, who was just appointed.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.820
I heard he was a former prosecutor.

18:31.903 --> 18:35.990
He's called Hairtail in the money market.
He's known for money laundering.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.576
If he launders money,

18:38.660 --> 18:41.996
he takes capital out of problematic
companies and delists them?

18:45.124 --> 18:49.629
If Myung sent him in,
it means he's trying to shut this down.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.396
Speak.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.731
Rambo's shares are taken care of.

19:09.649 --> 19:10.817
Did he say anything else?

19:10.900 --> 19:12.652
LEE SU-DONG
LAWYER (PREVIOUS CHIEF PROSECUTOR)

19:12.735 --> 19:15.822
Not if he wants to live another day.
What can he do?

19:15.905 --> 19:18.157
He says he'll do as you say.

19:18.241 --> 19:21.160
Good job.
See you tomorrow morning at golf.

19:21.244 --> 19:23.746
Yes, sir. Just one more thing.

19:24.622 --> 19:27.959
Rambo says the prosecutor-in-charge
is a straight shooter.

19:28.042 --> 19:30.003
Are you sure Chief Hwang has him?

19:30.086 --> 19:34.215
Young prosecutors these days
are impossible to predict.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.595
My son-in-law will take care of the kid.

19:40.430 --> 19:41.848
Okay. I understand.

19:47.478 --> 19:48.855
Damn bastards.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.486
What are you doing here?
You don't even smoke.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.323
Give me one.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.366
Really?

20:02.243 --> 20:03.369
Forget it.

20:12.795 --> 20:16.883
In your opinion, who should we go after?
Rambo or Kim Seong-tae?

20:16.966 --> 20:18.551
Who'll be easier to crack?

20:19.969 --> 20:23.014
Neither of them will ever betray Myung.

20:24.515 --> 20:27.060
Wait. You're saying
those gangsters have loyalty?

20:28.478 --> 20:32.023
It's not quite that,
but Myung is their source of income.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.699
You went to the seventh floor earlier.
Did Chief Hwang call for you?

20:43.242 --> 20:44.243
Yes.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.331
I'm sure he gave you sweet talk.

20:54.545 --> 20:56.172
Want my advice?

20:58.633 --> 21:01.886
Chief Hwang is not one to talk nonsense.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.638
He keeps all of his promises.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.892
-So you think--
-Don't ask me for my opinion.

21:07.976 --> 21:10.019
In the end, the choice is up to you.

21:11.646 --> 21:14.857
I believe it's time for me to clock out.
I'm going home now.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.835
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE

21:53.271 --> 21:56.149
-Hello.
-This is your temporary entrance ID.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.985
You can enter with this from now on.

22:00.111 --> 22:01.112
Okay.

22:06.701 --> 22:11.748
Here, at this press conference,
I want to make this clear:

22:11.831 --> 22:15.293
The prosecution's investigation
against my son

22:15.376 --> 22:18.880
is unjust and a political conspiracy.

22:20.048 --> 22:24.135
At the previous hearing, I made my case
about the former attorney general's wife's

22:25.178 --> 22:27.805
suspicions of violating the Farmland Actâ€¦

22:27.889 --> 22:30.308
-You wanted to see me?
-There you are.

22:30.391 --> 22:32.852
The prosecution's attempt against my sonâ€¦

22:33.603 --> 22:35.855
Have you seen
Assemblyman Baek's press conference?

22:37.315 --> 22:40.151
-Yes.
-It's a vindictive investigation.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.403
What do you think?

22:43.613 --> 22:47.283
He's trying to change the narrative.
Nothing new in the political scene.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.743
Archaic.

22:51.537 --> 22:54.540
-Let's take a new approach.
-What?

23:13.643 --> 23:15.645
-Where are you going?
-First floor.

23:18.731 --> 23:19.941
Look at me.

23:23.277 --> 23:25.780
Baek may have taken the headlines tonight,

23:25.863 --> 23:28.366
but we'll take back tomorrow's headlines.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.043
Let's go.

23:44.882 --> 23:46.342
Stand right next to me.

23:55.393 --> 23:58.563
The ruling party has accused the
prosecution of making a political move.

23:58.646 --> 24:02.567
What do you make of Assemblyman Baek's
suspicions about the attorney general?

24:02.650 --> 24:06.112
Baek argues the accusation against his son
is a vindictive investigation.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.573
Can we hear a word
from Special Investigations?

24:08.656 --> 24:09.991
My apologies to the press.

24:10.074 --> 24:13.494
We cannot discuss the details
of an ongoing investigation.

24:13.578 --> 24:16.497
Regarding allegations
of a vindictive investigation

24:16.581 --> 24:19.041
as a cover for the attorney general,
what's your comment?

24:19.125 --> 24:20.960
Did you say "vindictive investigation"?

24:24.964 --> 24:27.884
All right, fine.
I'll lay out the facts for you.

24:27.967 --> 24:31.012
Neither the Supreme Prosecution
nor the Special Investigations

24:31.095 --> 24:33.806
ordered the investigation of this case.

24:34.765 --> 24:37.894
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun
from Criminal Investigations ordered it.

24:40.229 --> 24:44.192
Over 200 cases per month
pass through Criminal Investigations.

24:44.275 --> 24:47.195
While working night shifts daily,
with his sense of duty,

24:47.278 --> 24:49.697
this young man has been investigating
with persistence.

24:49.780 --> 24:52.116
So framing this
as a vindictive investigation--

24:52.200 --> 24:54.911
Now, isn't that what we call
a political manipulation?

24:58.581 --> 25:00.291
The line must be drawn somewhere.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.754
As for why we launched this investigation,

25:05.838 --> 25:09.967
I believe it'll be fitting that
Prosecutor Jang addresses the people.

25:21.771 --> 25:23.564
There is no justice in nepotism.

25:24.315 --> 25:28.319
The unfair employment case terrorizes
younger generations born into poverty

25:28.402 --> 25:29.904
and tramples their dreams.

25:29.987 --> 25:33.366
We'll do our best with the investigation
to change this society

25:33.449 --> 25:35.117
into one with rules of equality.

25:56.931 --> 25:58.307
Sorry. Go ahead.

26:05.773 --> 26:08.776
WITH THE EFFORTS OF A YOUNG
PROSECUTOR, THE RESULTSâ€¦

26:21.539 --> 26:25.668
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS DISMISS
ALLEGATIONS OF VINDICTIVEâ€¦

26:30.673 --> 26:33.384
UNCLE YONG

26:49.108 --> 26:52.069
Hey, Tae-chun!
The homeroom teacher is looking for you.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.243
You want to be class president?

26:59.327 --> 27:01.954
Yes. If my classmates vote for me,
I'll do my best.

27:03.706 --> 27:07.376
Your mother would automatically
become the president of the PTA.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.921
I hear your mother works at a bar.

27:13.507 --> 27:16.719
I'd personally love to see a young,
pretty mom take the lead.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.598
She's so much younger than the other moms.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.224
You think she can take it?

27:23.017 --> 27:25.519
They'll make a fuss
if they find out she works at a bar.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.482
I won't run for class president.

27:30.066 --> 27:31.317
Good thinking.

27:32.360 --> 27:36.572
Your mom works all night selling booze
and entertainment to support you, right?

27:40.493 --> 27:43.788
Study harder,
so no one calls you a bar madam's son.

27:44.914 --> 27:48.417
But what's the name of your mom's place?

27:50.336 --> 27:52.004
Teachers need to do home visits.

27:52.088 --> 27:54.006
I need to discuss your future with her,

27:54.090 --> 27:57.593
and if I buy a few drinks at her place,
all the better, right?

28:06.435 --> 28:07.645
Something wrong?

28:11.565 --> 28:13.109
What are you lookin' at?

28:17.446 --> 28:19.490
This little bastard must've lost his mind.

28:19.573 --> 28:21.951
Hey. What you lookin' at?

28:22.827 --> 28:24.286
Are you listening?

28:25.871 --> 28:27.915
-You bastard.
-Wait, sir!

28:32.086 --> 28:34.255
Sir, sir! Please stop.

28:34.338 --> 28:36.424
Sir, what's wrong? Sir!

28:38.801 --> 28:41.804
Stop it. Stop it. Sir, please!
Sir, please stop.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.724
-What are you doing?
-Stop!

28:59.572 --> 29:00.739
Are you okay?

29:02.408 --> 29:03.409
Yeah.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.079
I'mâ€¦

29:13.085 --> 29:14.086
sorry.

29:33.355 --> 29:34.940
Jang Tae-chun, come with me.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.949
Am I really going to juvie?

29:44.742 --> 29:47.244
Did you have any problems
while you were here?

29:47.328 --> 29:48.329
No.

29:48.412 --> 29:51.248
Don't blab when you get out.
We're tired too.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.088
Sorry to bother you, sir.

29:58.172 --> 29:59.507
You may take him now.

30:00.216 --> 30:03.344
-Put in a good word for me, yeah?
-Yes, of course.

30:07.014 --> 30:10.100
-It's not much. Just for some snacks.
-Oh, my.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.939
Yes, yes. Thank you.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.491
Wow, Jang Tae-chun, you littleâ€¦

30:26.033 --> 30:28.577
You almost went to juvie, just like us.

30:31.247 --> 30:32.748
Uncle, did you pay a lot?

30:35.918 --> 30:37.503
Of course he did.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.339
He basically sold a small apartment.

30:43.217 --> 30:44.510
I'll pay you back.

30:45.052 --> 30:47.471
Better pay back with interest, you punk.

30:48.514 --> 30:49.557
Good job.

31:02.611 --> 31:03.946
Listen, kid.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.198
If you hit with something like a chair,

31:06.282 --> 31:08.534
they can charge you
for aggravated assault.

31:08.617 --> 31:10.578
You can't beat up a teacher like that--

31:10.661 --> 31:13.247
He's no teacher. He's a piece of garbage.

31:13.330 --> 31:17.293
Wow, Tae-chun. Feisty, aren't you?

31:18.085 --> 31:20.087
You be my boss from now on.

31:21.589 --> 31:23.048
How's Mom?

31:23.132 --> 31:26.969
I told her I'd teach you a lesson,
and she told me not to kill you.

31:27.928 --> 31:29.847
At least she doesn't cry anymore.

31:34.268 --> 31:35.269
She cried?

31:41.775 --> 31:43.986
We need more bottles.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.530
I'm going to go buy us more liquor.

31:49.325 --> 31:50.492
Hey, Tae-chun.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.457
I don't mind spending money
when you're in trouble.

31:57.333 --> 31:58.542
But my sisterâ€¦

32:00.669 --> 32:02.921
Don't hurt her feelings, okay?

32:05.674 --> 32:06.675
Okay.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.260
Good.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.931
I know what I want to be now.

32:13.515 --> 32:15.309
Law school, then prosecutor.

32:15.392 --> 32:17.019
This little punk.

32:17.811 --> 32:19.188
Jail made you grow up.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.565
I get nothing out of using my fists.

32:21.649 --> 32:24.818
I'll become a prosecutor
and lock up all those pieces of shit.

32:27.029 --> 32:28.113
Sounds good.

32:32.076 --> 32:33.077
Here.

32:37.164 --> 32:38.582
Drink.

32:58.977 --> 33:03.357
No hatred, no hatred, no hatred

33:04.775 --> 33:06.985
No holding back, holding back

33:07.069 --> 33:09.405
I just give love

33:09.488 --> 33:11.907
My mom made money selling booze
all her life.

33:13.325 --> 33:17.413
By the time she turned 40,
she was diagnosed with alcoholic dementia.

33:18.622 --> 33:21.625
Thanks to Uncle Yong,
she's at the fanciest facility,

33:22.251 --> 33:24.378
but she still lives in the past,

33:24.461 --> 33:28.924
living in memories of working at
the teahouse and the Forget-Me-Not Bar.

33:44.940 --> 33:48.902
She doesn't recognize me as an adult.

33:55.534 --> 33:56.660
What about Uncle?

33:56.744 --> 33:58.871
Oh, Mr. Prosecutor.

33:59.830 --> 34:02.166
Who's your uncle?

34:04.501 --> 34:06.587
Madam Eun's brother.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.255
Tae-chun's uncle.

34:08.338 --> 34:09.798
Oh, wow.

34:09.882 --> 34:12.468
How did you know Yong stopped by?

34:12.551 --> 34:15.429
Chicken delivery!

34:15.512 --> 34:19.266
Wow. These days,
ordering chicken is so complicated.

34:19.349 --> 34:21.685
-It looks so good.
-When did you get here?

34:24.563 --> 34:26.023
Jang Tae-chun!

34:27.941 --> 34:29.485
Get in here. Get in here.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.112
Stop it. Get in where?

34:32.196 --> 34:34.323
Come here. Come. Should I go, then?

34:34.406 --> 34:36.950
-Stop it. I'm not going anywhere.
-Get over here!

34:40.662 --> 34:41.872
Tae-chun!

34:43.665 --> 34:46.126
I can't believe how much you've grown!

34:46.210 --> 34:48.045
-You been well?
-I'm not a child.

34:48.128 --> 34:49.963
Wow. Prosecutor Jang!

34:50.506 --> 34:52.174
Tae-chun, my baby!

34:52.257 --> 34:54.009
I'm a grown-up now!

35:00.849 --> 35:04.019
I used to drink with your mom
after I put you to bed.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.897
Now I'm drinking with you
after putting her to bed.

35:08.357 --> 35:10.651
When you went to juvie for catching tunaâ€¦

35:13.529 --> 35:15.489
you must've felt the injustice of it all.

35:15.572 --> 35:18.116
I looked at your trial records
after I was sworn in.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.036
The victim and the perpetrator
totally switched places.

35:23.831 --> 35:26.458
I had no money or power back then.

35:26.542 --> 35:29.294
Dwelling solves nothing,
so I just kept working.

35:34.967 --> 35:38.428
I'm grateful to you.
I'm here because of you and Mom.

35:39.221 --> 35:42.057
I might've gone to juvie, at the least.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.187
Right. I saw the news about Yeouido Rambo.

35:47.271 --> 35:49.898
I gotta say, you looked the part.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.443
Right. Thank you for your help.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.656
That promissory note, you punk.

35:57.739 --> 35:59.533
I was just paying off a debt.

35:59.616 --> 36:02.119
Hey, by the way,
how's the investigation going?

36:04.913 --> 36:07.666
I can't give you details,
even if you're my uncle.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.878
Bullshit. You faxed me a ledger.

36:10.961 --> 36:14.047
The book belongs to Chairman Myung,
I gather.

36:15.299 --> 36:17.092
Are you going that far?

36:17.676 --> 36:20.262
-How do you know that?
-Because, you dimwit,

36:21.597 --> 36:24.349
I learned the money business
from Chairman Myung.

36:25.434 --> 36:26.435
Really?

36:28.020 --> 36:31.899
Then what did he originally do?
How did a loan shark get so rich?

36:33.275 --> 36:36.111
He didn't give out petty change to people.

36:37.154 --> 36:38.864
He dealt with corporations.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.824
MYUNGIN CONSTRUCTION

36:46.413 --> 36:51.168
Myung specialized in stock mortgage loans.

36:53.170 --> 36:56.715
I'll put up my shares
as the largest shareholder

36:56.798 --> 36:58.216
for a two-month loan.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.719
Gwangwoon Industrial Company.

37:00.802 --> 37:03.013
Gwang for light, and Woon for luck.

37:03.096 --> 37:04.514
Great name.

37:07.267 --> 37:09.686
Mr. Eun, how are the numbers looking?

37:10.395 --> 37:13.815
It'll be 15,000 won per week.
You leave 30%, we subtract the change,

37:13.899 --> 37:15.817
the securities will be worth
ten billion won.

37:16.652 --> 37:18.362
Ten billion in securities.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.865
Meaning, 50% in loans.

37:22.574 --> 37:26.411
Take off our 5% fee, minus the interest.
Let's go with 4.5 billion won, okay?

37:27.329 --> 37:31.583
But we're not using brokers,
so why are you taking a fee?

37:32.167 --> 37:34.419
Then come again after you get a broker.

37:35.212 --> 37:37.214
Those kids will take about 10%, I assume.

37:42.594 --> 37:46.932
Well, if that's the case,
can you deposit the money by today?

37:47.015 --> 37:48.976
Don't worry about that.

37:49.977 --> 37:52.437
Right now, it's 15,000 won per share,

37:53.146 --> 37:55.065
but if the price falls below 10,000 won,

37:55.148 --> 37:57.901
we're selling those securities
and taking the principal.

37:57.985 --> 37:59.403
Wait.

37:59.486 --> 38:02.990
Our stock will never drop that low.

38:03.073 --> 38:05.117
Of course not.

38:07.411 --> 38:09.413
IOU

38:11.790 --> 38:12.833
All right.

38:14.251 --> 38:15.335
It's done.

38:18.463 --> 38:21.883
Once the loan transaction is complete
and the loan is deposited,

38:21.967 --> 38:26.013
from that point on,
that's when Myung really gets to work.

38:33.478 --> 38:34.813
Yes.

38:34.896 --> 38:38.316
I have stocks from Gwangwoon Industrial.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.902
Strike it down to 10,000 per share
at public sale.

38:40.986 --> 38:43.196
-The ratio?
-You and I go way back.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.573
7-to-3.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.199
He lends them money up front.

38:46.283 --> 38:49.953
On the other hand,
he holds a short selling.

38:50.704 --> 38:54.541
He uses personnel
from securities firms to pull that off.

38:55.876 --> 39:00.005
Short sellings mean
making money off short-selling stocks.

39:00.088 --> 39:03.425
What is the value
of the securities you've got?

39:03.508 --> 39:04.509
Ten billion won.

39:04.593 --> 39:07.387
Look into those numbers. They look good.

39:08.805 --> 39:12.225
The securities firm receives the ledger,
then puts up the stocks for a short sale.

39:12.309 --> 39:16.688
The firm posts negative report
and releases those stocks on the market.

39:16.772 --> 39:19.941
It's a natural free fall in the market.

39:20.025 --> 39:25.322
The CEO that gave up the stocks
loses his mind by then.

39:25.405 --> 39:26.656
Where is he?

39:26.740 --> 39:27.991
What's wrong? What?

39:28.075 --> 39:31.119
You sold the stocks I entrusted to you.

39:31.203 --> 39:33.914
If not, how could the price fall so low?

39:33.997 --> 39:36.166
Huh? Where's Myung, that bastard?

39:36.249 --> 39:38.502
-Sir, put this down first.
-Damn it, you!

39:38.585 --> 39:40.837
Hey, what the hell is all this about?

39:44.299 --> 39:47.302
Give me back my stocks. You sold them off!

39:47.385 --> 39:49.930
Will you look at this gentleman?

39:50.013 --> 39:52.057
-Manager Eun.
-Yes.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.851
-Show him the stocks from our vault.
-Yes, sir.

39:57.813 --> 39:59.606
You see them here, don't you?

39:59.689 --> 40:02.442
Let's be gentlemen
when business is concerned.

40:02.526 --> 40:05.070
I apologize for earlier.

40:05.153 --> 40:07.739
The stock price fell very low,

40:07.823 --> 40:10.867
so I thought they were on the market.

40:10.951 --> 40:12.410
Forget the excuse.

40:13.245 --> 40:15.038
If it falls below 10,000 won,

40:16.123 --> 40:17.624
we will be selling them.

40:17.707 --> 40:19.292
Wait a minute.

40:19.376 --> 40:23.421
I'll give you 5% more for interest.
Please, just give me a little more time.

40:23.505 --> 40:25.465
I'm just following our contract.

40:25.549 --> 40:28.552
I need to get my money back
before your stock falls too low.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.971
I'll give you 10% more.

40:31.054 --> 40:33.098
Please help me out, okay?

40:33.682 --> 40:35.350
My goodness.

40:35.934 --> 40:39.229
Fine. I'll wait a little longer.

40:39.312 --> 40:42.190
Don't stake your life
for the sake of some money.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.943
-Please sit.
-Okay.

40:45.819 --> 40:47.612
That part was true.

40:47.696 --> 40:50.991
Chairman Myung doesn't stake his life
on a petty sum.

40:51.074 --> 40:54.286
-I'll put these back in the vault.
-No need.

40:55.162 --> 40:59.416
Take that to Namsan Securities and sell it
when it drops to 10,000 won.

41:00.959 --> 41:04.296
But he's offering 10% more interest.
Shouldn't we wait a bit more?

41:05.005 --> 41:06.131
Hey, kid.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.551
What am I, a beggar?
What good is pocket change?

41:09.634 --> 41:12.554
It'll fall below 10,000 won today.
Throw it in, already.

41:13.138 --> 41:14.222
Yes, sir.

41:24.774 --> 41:26.276
So he just tosses them away?

41:26.359 --> 41:29.529
The counter-trading clause
is in the contract anyway.

41:30.113 --> 41:32.949
Once the price falls below 10,000 won

41:33.033 --> 41:35.076
and 30% is liquidated,

41:36.077 --> 41:39.080
the stock price free-falls,
quite literally.

41:40.790 --> 41:44.377
Lower prices mean higher gains
from the short selling.

41:45.879 --> 41:48.715
In a month and a half,

41:48.798 --> 41:51.259
Myung makes 4 billion won.

41:51.343 --> 41:53.094
4 billion won back then?

41:53.178 --> 41:56.514
An office worker's average income was
1.9 million won at the time.

41:56.598 --> 42:01.895
You'd need to work 173 years
to make that amount.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.857
That is fascinating.

42:07.234 --> 42:09.569
What happens to the company afterwards?

42:10.820 --> 42:12.197
In shambles, of course.

42:12.822 --> 42:14.824
The company, the people.

42:18.495 --> 42:22.123
When a company goes bankrupt like that,
the courts take over,

42:22.207 --> 42:25.168
and the company gets delisted.

42:37.514 --> 42:40.100
-Oh, my!
-What the hell?

42:41.768 --> 42:43.603
-Is he dead?
-Oh, no!

42:45.730 --> 42:47.983
-Well, firstâ€¦
-Call the police.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.317
Call emergency.

42:50.527 --> 42:52.737
-Shouldn't we call the police?
-Of course.

42:59.995 --> 43:03.081
Who the hell is walking through windows
and not doors?

43:04.416 --> 43:07.043
It looks like CEO Kim
of Gwangwoon Industrial.

43:07.127 --> 43:08.420
Mr. Kim?

43:09.671 --> 43:12.632
Why did he have to kill himself here?
It's bad luck.

43:13.591 --> 43:17.262
I guess the man was a goner
even before his company was delisted.

43:19.180 --> 43:20.473
My goodness.

43:37.532 --> 43:38.908
Manager Eun.

43:38.992 --> 43:39.993
Yes.

43:40.076 --> 43:41.703
After you drop me off,

43:42.579 --> 43:44.831
go check the vault at the office.

43:45.915 --> 43:47.334
Yes, sir.

43:51.338 --> 43:52.881
He had cash envelopes inside the vault

43:52.964 --> 43:56.009
that he had prepared
for those he'd expected to die.

43:57.010 --> 44:00.972
That was the day
I decided to part ways with him.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.942
I learned my skill from Chairman Myung,

44:13.735 --> 44:16.905
but I had the confidence
to make money in a different way.

44:17.572 --> 44:18.698
Skill?

44:20.241 --> 44:22.827
It's just fraud and illegal stuff,
isn't it?

44:24.871 --> 44:27.207
Loaning to corporations isn't all illegal.

44:28.458 --> 44:30.960
Though Chairman Myung is a con man.

44:32.337 --> 44:36.466
You're both loan sharks,
but you are different from him?

44:38.760 --> 44:40.303
What about you?

44:40.387 --> 44:41.679
Are you different

44:42.639 --> 44:44.015
from Hwang Gi-seok?

44:47.394 --> 44:49.687
You do know
he's Chairman Myung's son-in-law.

44:53.358 --> 44:56.945
I saw you both got your picture taken
for the headlines.

44:57.946 --> 44:59.322
So?

45:00.031 --> 45:02.075
Are you going to drink from his cup?

45:06.371 --> 45:08.415
Let's make a deal, you and I.

45:11.543 --> 45:13.378
I'll help you get Myung.

45:15.422 --> 45:16.631
A deal?

45:18.383 --> 45:20.301
Then what do you want in return?

45:22.303 --> 45:24.597
A prosecutor who will see
this investigation through.

45:29.644 --> 45:31.938
I know Chairman Myung better than anyone.

45:32.021 --> 45:36.443
I guaranteeâ€¦
you'll be the one to put handcuffs on him.

45:41.322 --> 45:42.490
On one condition:

45:43.658 --> 45:46.619
Don't take any of Hwang's offers,
no matter what.

45:48.621 --> 45:50.290
That's my only condition.

46:03.052 --> 46:05.597
-I'm Park Joon-gyeong.
-He's waiting for you.

46:19.152 --> 46:20.361
There you are.

46:20.904 --> 46:22.155
Sit here.

46:23.406 --> 46:24.574
Take a seat.

46:29.329 --> 46:30.497
Is this okay?

46:32.624 --> 46:34.834
Why did you leave without seeing me?

46:36.669 --> 46:38.463
You should have stopped by.

46:38.546 --> 46:40.048
We could have talked.

46:45.470 --> 46:47.555
I think we've talked enough.

47:09.536 --> 47:13.164
Don't think you're so different
just because you wear a uniform now.

47:13.248 --> 47:15.833
Judicial officers are like family to us.

47:17.126 --> 47:19.003
Chairman Myung is your family.

47:20.213 --> 47:21.506
So is this revenge?

47:23.383 --> 47:25.969
Can you think of a reason
why I might want revenge?

47:26.052 --> 47:31.224
If prosecution won't punish the sinful,
someone else has to.

47:32.433 --> 47:33.476
Is that right?

47:35.103 --> 47:36.229
But the thing is,

47:36.896 --> 47:40.483
if I were you, I wouldn't fight me.

47:41.067 --> 47:45.363
I didn't get here by running reckless
and praying for luck.

47:45.446 --> 47:46.573
Yes, I'm aware.

47:46.656 --> 47:48.241
If you know, then why?

47:48.950 --> 47:53.454
You really shouldn't start
any sort of rivalry with me.

47:54.622 --> 47:56.791
You're an educated man, so you know.

47:56.874 --> 47:59.877
If you get a question wrong,
you try again.

47:59.961 --> 48:02.714
I reviewed and previewed for three years.

48:03.631 --> 48:05.967
I won't get the same question wrong twice.

48:19.897 --> 48:21.399
I'll buy next time.

48:30.783 --> 48:32.577
You want another fight, huh?

48:51.304 --> 48:53.640
-Yeah.
-How's the place?

48:53.723 --> 48:55.141
Yeah, it's fine.

48:55.725 --> 48:59.812
Hey, it's not easy to find a penthouse
with an open ceiling in Seoul.

49:00.772 --> 49:02.565
Please settle down now.

49:02.649 --> 49:05.985
I'll set up a tent on the roof
if you start to miss Mongolia.

49:06.069 --> 49:07.737
The wind is nice.

49:08.863 --> 49:10.657
But the air doesn't compare.

49:11.491 --> 49:13.159
To hell with the air.

49:13.242 --> 49:16.037
I'll buy you an oxygen canister.
Just carry that around.

49:16.120 --> 49:19.040
That's a great idea. Thanks for that.

49:19.123 --> 49:23.169
A company car will pick you up
at 8:30 a.m. That'll be your ride.

49:23.252 --> 49:26.339
No, forget the car. I'm driving my own.

49:50.697 --> 49:51.781
Excuse me.

49:54.784 --> 49:56.285
What brings you here?

49:56.369 --> 49:57.995
-What?
-Hello, sir.

49:58.705 --> 50:00.998
I prepared the model you always drive.
Come with me.

50:02.083 --> 50:04.168
-Is that the new model?
-Yes, it is.

50:10.299 --> 50:11.342
Thanks.

50:13.553 --> 50:14.929
Thank you, sir.

50:33.448 --> 50:36.117
-Nice shot!
-Nice shot!

50:36.200 --> 50:39.746
Are you folding GMI completely
and letting it delist?

50:39.829 --> 50:42.582
It's indicted by the prosecution.
Then it's a goner, no?

50:42.665 --> 50:45.126
Your name's been mentioned
in the media too often.

50:45.209 --> 50:47.879
Can't you raise the stock price
one last time

50:47.962 --> 50:49.797
before you wipe your hands clean?

50:49.881 --> 50:52.008
-Can you do that?
-Forget it.

50:52.967 --> 50:55.595
Don't jump at making petty bills
at this point.

50:55.678 --> 50:57.722
Wow. Petty bills?

50:57.805 --> 51:01.434
This is why I admire you, Chairman.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.061
But you know something?

51:04.145 --> 51:06.647
This case was a little complicated,

51:06.731 --> 51:09.066
so my laundry fee will cost
a pretty penny.

51:09.150 --> 51:11.944
I know that.
I've done business with you enough.

51:18.576 --> 51:20.369
You get the corporation's work?

51:20.453 --> 51:23.164
You make money,
only to serve it up to lawyers.

51:23.873 --> 51:25.458
Come on, sir.

51:26.292 --> 51:29.504
The money I make is just a pittance.

51:29.587 --> 51:32.215
I should have waited to become
a chief prosecutor.

51:32.298 --> 51:36.677
I'd have become a CEO
and have the country vote for me too.

51:36.761 --> 51:38.721
Then why did you drink and drive?

51:39.347 --> 51:41.057
Do you still gamble?

51:42.350 --> 51:45.645
-Every once in a while, for fun.
-He'll quit when hell freezes over.

51:46.479 --> 51:51.275
Anyway, you'd better do your laundry well.
The assemblymen nominations are coming up.

51:51.359 --> 51:52.777
Yes, I know.

51:54.445 --> 51:58.866
Sir, there's nothing besides the car lease
and you using the company card, right?

51:58.950 --> 52:01.369
-I have to know--
-Kid.

52:01.452 --> 52:04.121
I wrote the manual
on corporate investigations.

52:04.205 --> 52:06.624
-That's right.
-I'll be fine. Don't worry.

52:10.253 --> 52:11.754
Nice shot!

52:40.449 --> 52:42.869
Who's this? Manager Eun!

52:42.952 --> 52:44.745
Wow. It's been too long.

52:52.044 --> 52:55.006
I heard you made a load of money overseas.

52:56.591 --> 52:59.719
-So good to see you.
-You're exactly the same.

52:59.802 --> 53:01.596
I'm a granny now.

53:02.471 --> 53:06.517
So what's up? Got something good?
Let me in on some.

53:09.979 --> 53:14.525
You and your friends bought GMI shares
worth 1 billion from the chairman.

53:15.109 --> 53:16.652
The cash Oh Chang-hyeon took.

53:18.446 --> 53:19.530
What about it?

53:21.490 --> 53:24.327
Sell me the contract
with Oh's signature on it.

53:25.578 --> 53:27.872
What's up, Mr. Eun?

53:27.955 --> 53:31.417
Who sells contracts for cash?
You know how the game works.

53:31.500 --> 53:34.587
What can't you buy with money
in this game?

53:35.504 --> 53:37.048
How much do you want?

53:45.431 --> 53:46.766
Will this be enough?

53:49.268 --> 53:52.897
I bought a few bonds you ladies put up
at daily rates.

53:53.773 --> 53:55.816
You want to put up daily rates now?

53:56.484 --> 53:58.569
Maybe 1% less than you ladies?

54:02.156 --> 54:06.410
I'm not sure how much money you've made,
but go for it.

54:07.119 --> 54:09.038
You think Dongdaemun is so easy?

54:09.121 --> 54:11.707
You know I'm no fool.

54:13.834 --> 54:15.419
Oh, wait. Hang on.

54:17.463 --> 54:19.006
Hey, Miss Hong, it's me.

54:19.590 --> 54:23.678
Take up all the daily rates in the other
three domains except Ms. Kim's.

54:24.345 --> 54:25.346
Yeah.

54:26.347 --> 54:29.392
Doesn't matter how much it is. No sweat.

54:30.601 --> 54:32.436
Okay. I'll call you later.

54:35.022 --> 54:36.440
What are you up to?

54:39.443 --> 54:43.572
I'm wiping out the other three domains
and making them worthless.

54:44.573 --> 54:46.867
The economy in Dongdaemun
isn't that great anyway.

54:46.951 --> 54:48.953
Not much room to share, is there?

54:49.036 --> 54:50.913
Ms. Kim, you should hoard it all.

54:54.125 --> 54:57.628
You've always wanted to take over
the Dongdaemun market.

54:57.712 --> 54:59.797
I'll make it happen for you.

54:59.880 --> 55:01.007
Soâ€¦

55:01.507 --> 55:04.510
just hand over one piece of paper.

55:04.593 --> 55:06.512
We'll make it our little secret.

55:21.235 --> 55:22.528
LEE JIN-HO
MANAGER AT GMI BANK

55:22.611 --> 55:23.946
-I went for visitation.
-Okay.

55:24.030 --> 55:26.741
How is Seong-tae these days?

55:26.824 --> 55:30.536
He said life's comfortable in there
since you've been looking out for him.

55:32.121 --> 55:35.041
I also got him to sign this:
the stock waiver form.

55:38.252 --> 55:39.420
Let's see.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.631
STOCK WAIVER - KIM SEONG-TAE

55:46.469 --> 55:48.137
Okay. Good job.

55:49.680 --> 55:50.681
All right.

55:52.016 --> 55:53.059
Chairman.

55:54.685 --> 55:57.605
Is the prosecutor
in charge of Seong-tae's case

55:58.439 --> 55:59.899
really Jang Tae-chun?

56:03.194 --> 56:04.320
You know him?

56:11.077 --> 56:14.080
Gi-seok, good job working so late
for the nation.

56:14.163 --> 56:15.498
I'm going home now.

56:15.581 --> 56:17.750
Are you? Just a sec.

56:18.375 --> 56:20.795
Get me some immigration records.

56:23.798 --> 56:24.799
For what?

56:25.466 --> 56:27.426
Did someone steal your money again?

56:28.344 --> 56:29.637
It's not that.

56:31.180 --> 56:35.309
There's a man named Eun Yong.
He betrayed me and fled the country.

56:37.186 --> 56:40.481
It turns out that
he's Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun's uncle.

56:43.025 --> 56:44.443
His uncle?

56:45.486 --> 56:47.446
Something seems fishy.

56:56.122 --> 56:57.790
He looks so good.

56:59.959 --> 57:02.419
Did the chairman's son get himself
in trouble again?

57:03.546 --> 57:06.006
My son is a bookworm.
All he does is study.

57:06.090 --> 57:09.051
You're boasting about your son again.

57:09.135 --> 57:12.972
My Tae-chun-- He's going to law school
to become a prosecutor.

57:13.055 --> 57:16.892
-A prosecutor is good.
-I'm feeling good.

57:16.976 --> 57:18.936
Let's sing a song!

57:21.772 --> 57:23.440
Yes, yes.

57:23.524 --> 57:27.945
Long ago, from a certain star

57:29.196 --> 57:33.742
I was born into the world

57:35.119 --> 57:39.331
I heard a voice tell me

57:40.833 --> 57:45.796
"Give me love"

57:46.922 --> 57:51.510
A flower that blooms when in love

57:52.803 --> 57:57.308
I was told to make a hundred bloom

57:58.642 --> 58:01.020
True loveâ€¦

58:01.103 --> 58:04.690
Friday, we're meeting seniors
from the Superior Office.

58:04.773 --> 58:08.152
A rose that bloomsâ€¦

58:10.446 --> 58:12.031
No hatredâ€¦

58:12.114 --> 58:14.700
UNCLE YONG

58:15.492 --> 58:18.537
Don't take any of Hwang's offers,
no matter what.

58:21.832 --> 58:26.462
A hundred, a hundred
A hundred flowers bloomâ€¦

58:28.505 --> 58:31.091
So, you're the one
who sent the anonymous tip.

58:33.219 --> 58:36.138
Hello, 40th class
of the Institute of Justice. I'm Jang--

58:36.222 --> 58:38.349
The battle of one lonesome prosecutor.

58:38.432 --> 58:41.268
I saw you on the news with Chief Hwang.

58:42.228 --> 58:43.229
Yes.

58:43.312 --> 58:46.440
How's the investigation
with the stock-manipulation case?

58:47.316 --> 58:50.986
Are arrests scheduled
for CEO Oh and Chairman Myung?

58:52.488 --> 58:54.448
Well, you probably know this.

58:54.531 --> 58:56.533
-I can't reveal case details of--
-Right.

58:56.617 --> 59:00.412
The document you needed to prove
Oh was involved in the manipulation--

59:00.496 --> 59:01.664
I have it.

59:03.165 --> 59:04.875
-You do?
-Yes.

59:06.126 --> 59:08.170
CEO Oh is in our hands now,

59:09.713 --> 59:11.632
so take my offer, not Hwang's.

59:12.466 --> 59:15.344
Where and how did you obtain the document?

59:17.888 --> 59:19.974
I bought it. With money.

59:20.057 --> 59:22.935
Damn. I knew it.

59:23.018 --> 59:26.021
Illegally obtained evidence
is typically inadmissible in court.

59:27.064 --> 59:28.691
You know this.

59:28.774 --> 59:31.110
Criminal Procedure Act, Article 1108:

59:31.193 --> 59:34.947
"Evidence gathered inappropriately
cannot be used as evidence."

59:35.030 --> 59:37.157
There's room for dispute on that.

59:38.033 --> 59:39.034
Room for dispute?

59:42.621 --> 59:45.582
I see you're not a prosecutor
but just a legal professional.

59:46.625 --> 59:48.627
We have the evidence to prove a crime,

59:48.711 --> 59:52.006
but you're looking through the books,
searching for reasons to disprove it.

59:52.089 --> 59:54.008
I can see why Hwang likes you.

59:54.091 --> 59:56.468
Ma'am, that's a bit tooâ€¦

1:00:04.435 --> 1:00:07.271
All I want is to follow law and order--

1:00:07.354 --> 1:00:11.817
Using the law as a shield,
capturing a few thugs to close cases.

1:00:12.818 --> 1:00:15.988
You'll be transferred
to Special Investigations in no time.

1:00:19.908 --> 1:00:24.538
But I'm impressed you've made it this far.
Not that you'll ever see me again.

1:00:25.706 --> 1:00:27.082
I'll get going.

1:00:27.166 --> 1:00:28.167
Okay.

1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:31.086
Get home safe.

1:00:49.396 --> 1:00:52.441
I know Myung has a lot of dirt to collect.

1:00:52.524 --> 1:00:54.109
But Chief Hwang--

1:00:54.902 --> 1:00:56.945
He's a master at manipulating cases.

1:00:58.864 --> 1:01:02.451
He sure knew how to use your case
to shift public opinion.

1:01:04.078 --> 1:01:06.038
I admit he's good with the press.

1:01:07.915 --> 1:01:11.752
Either way, Assemblyman Baek's case
is important too.

1:01:14.171 --> 1:01:15.297
Honestly, though,

1:01:16.006 --> 1:01:19.009
as someone with no connections
from an unknown college,

1:01:19.802 --> 1:01:21.470
it was a hard-earned opportunity.

1:01:23.764 --> 1:01:24.765
Frankly speaking,

1:01:25.682 --> 1:01:29.228
how many times will I get the opportunity
to investigate whales like these?

1:01:30.270 --> 1:01:33.732
Do you really think Hwang will ever launch
a proper investigation

1:01:34.483 --> 1:01:36.026
against those whales?

1:01:38.445 --> 1:01:40.030
I don't care what he does.

1:01:42.241 --> 1:01:43.325
I'm going to.

1:01:43.992 --> 1:01:45.702
Until the end, the right way.

1:01:47.121 --> 1:01:48.122
Okay.

1:01:49.623 --> 1:01:51.333
I like the look in your eyes.

1:01:51.959 --> 1:01:54.294
That's good enough. Come.

1:01:54.378 --> 1:01:57.131
Now what? Come down. It's dangerous.

1:02:02.970 --> 1:02:04.930
High places are always dangerous.

1:02:06.306 --> 1:02:08.434
That's why you must get used to it,

1:02:09.852 --> 1:02:11.770
to be able to stand in high places.

1:02:17.234 --> 1:02:18.402
Hey, Tae-chun.

1:02:21.238 --> 1:02:23.073
Jang Tae-chun!

1:02:28.579 --> 1:02:29.746
Take my hand now.

1:02:31.081 --> 1:02:32.249
I will make you

1:02:33.167 --> 1:02:36.086
the highest-level prosecutor
in this country.

1:03:26.136 --> 1:03:29.765
Recently, he flew in from Mongolia
in his private plane.

1:03:30.599 --> 1:03:32.643
My father-in-law was right.

1:03:32.726 --> 1:03:35.020
If a rookie prosecutor like me
captures Chairman Myung,

1:03:35.103 --> 1:03:37.439
the loan shark king,
it'd be unbelievable, right?

1:03:37.523 --> 1:03:39.858
Only if you get him. Or else you'll die.

1:03:39.942 --> 1:03:42.861
Chairman Myung and his son-in-law
committed a crime together.

1:03:43.403 --> 1:03:46.740
Current GMI Bank, former Bluenet.

1:03:46.823 --> 1:03:48.242
Do you remember CEO Yoon?

1:03:48.325 --> 1:03:50.244
Please cancel
all his afternoon appointments.

1:03:50.327 --> 1:03:51.995
Something smells fishy here.

1:03:52.079 --> 1:03:53.872
Did Myung send you?

1:03:53.956 --> 1:03:56.416
I have just the right card
for this dirty dogfight.

1:03:57.584 --> 1:04:01.088
The enemy's enemy.
Meaning, an ally of ours, right?
