08:48.709 --> 08:50.458
At my wedding.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.083
I'm so sorry
I didn't tell you,

08:52.083 --> 08:56.041
but today is the day
I was going to marry Chad.

08:56.041 --> 08:57.250
-Oh.
-Yeah.

08:57.250 --> 08:58.542
And if that wasn't bad enough,

08:58.542 --> 09:01.041
we canceled so late, I'm still
paying for the reception.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.583
Well, that's just cruel.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.875
What, they wouldn't give you
a refund?

09:03.875 --> 09:07.291
I tried, the manager--
he was like, "No."

09:07.291 --> 09:09.125
Just like that,
like, "No"?

09:09.125 --> 09:11.375
Yeah, right in my face,
over the phone.

09:11.375 --> 09:12.917
MATT: God, what I wouldn't
give for, like,

09:12.917 --> 09:15.000
five minutes with that guy.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.291
It's really close,
we could go.

09:16.291 --> 09:17.542
-Like right now?
-Yeah, like right now.

09:17.542 --> 09:19.125
-Yeah, all right, let's go.
-Okay, get the car.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.083
-Yeah.
-Mhm.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.250
Yeah, you know what,
let's walk.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.834
I'm too angry to drive.

09:22.834 --> 09:23.875
-Sir?
-Yeah.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.583
Your car is on fire.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.375
(scoffing)

09:27.375 --> 09:29.500
This guy.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.000
I'm sorry, ma'am,
as I told you

09:31.000 --> 09:32.458
when you canceled,
the reservation

09:32.458 --> 09:34.000
is nonrefundable.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.542
-Oh, is it?
-Yes, it is.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.083
Mm, this is why
I didn't go to law school.

09:37.083 --> 09:38.709
You're doing great,
isn't she doing great?

09:38.709 --> 09:39.917
You know what,
we're gonna need to see

09:39.917 --> 09:41.792
the supposedly empty ballroom
that she's paying for.

09:41.792 --> 09:44.834
Yeah, there's no way you
guys aren't double dipping.

09:44.834 --> 09:45.959
-Okay, let's go.
-You want to--

09:45.959 --> 09:47.500
-Mhm, yeah.
-Probably should.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.750
COLLEEN: Yeah, let's do it.

09:48.750 --> 09:49.834
I'll do it. I'll show you.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.959
Here's my card
with my cell phone.

09:57.959 --> 10:01.250
If you have any problems,
don't hesitate to call.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.083

10:03.083 --> 10:04.375
This guy.

10:04.375 --> 10:06.834
(scoffing)

10:09.083 --> 10:11.542
It's magical in here.

10:11.542 --> 10:13.041
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

10:13.041 --> 10:14.542
-Mm...
-No.

10:14.542 --> 10:16.959
I am...

10:16.959 --> 10:18.458
I'm so sorry.

10:18.458 --> 10:21.333
I have no business trying
to date somebody right now.

10:21.333 --> 10:23.000
I'm a mess.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.291
You're a really sweet guy,

10:24.291 --> 10:26.625
and, um, you don't need this.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.375
I release you from the disaster
that is my life,

10:29.375 --> 10:31.458
and I will see you
at work on Monday,

10:31.458 --> 10:33.959
and we can pretend
that this never happened.

10:33.959 --> 10:36.625
My car's on fire.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.166
What?

10:38.166 --> 10:40.583
I'm 38 years old,
I'm drowning in debt.

10:40.583 --> 10:42.959
I live in my parents' garage
and when this date is over,

10:42.959 --> 10:45.291
I have to call my mom
to come and pick us up.

10:45.291 --> 10:47.875
Your life is a disaster,
my life is a disaster.

10:47.875 --> 10:49.375
It's why we're perfect
for each other.

10:49.375 --> 10:52.291
And the best thing that we can
do for the dating world

10:52.291 --> 10:55.750
is to just take each other
off of the market.

12:30.959 --> 12:33.083
We can just supplement
with formula.
