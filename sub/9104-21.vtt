&lrm;No, thank you, Adrien.
&lrm;Cooking needs no words.

&lrm;Thanks, Adrien.
&lrm;Sorry for bothering you for nothing.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.560

&lrm;he couldn't speak English.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.920
&lrm;No problem.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.080
&lrm;It was awesome to practice
&lrm;my Chinese with the Sifu.

04:01.240 --> 04:02.520
&lrm;The Sifu?

04:02.960 --> 04:05.520
&lrm;It means "master".
&lrm;He's a great master.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.520
&lrm;Well, look who it is.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.320
&lrm;My favourite person,
&lrm;Marinette Dupain-Cheng.

04:10.480 --> 04:14.920
&lrm;Seriously, does your great uncle
&lrm;expect to win with a soup?

04:15.080 --> 04:17.079
&lrm;It's not even a main dish.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.519
&lrm;Can't he make sushi
&lrm;like everyone else?

04:19.920 --> 04:23.080
&lrm;Japanese people make sushi.
&lrm;Cheng Sifu is Chinese.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.400
&lrm;And he's not "like everyone else."

04:25.560 --> 04:28.880
&lrm;He's the best chef in the world.
&lrm;His soup is legendary.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.640
&lrm;Well, I despise soup.

04:30.800 --> 04:31.800
&lrm;So what?

04:31.960 --> 04:33.920
&lrm;Didn't you know? I'm on the jury.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.520
&lrm;Your uncle will not get my vote.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.520
&lrm;Yeah? He doesn't need
&lrm;your vote to win.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.240
&lrm;The other judges have
&lrm;better taste than you.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.800
&lrm;Silly me. You have no taste.
&lrm;Look at your clothes.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.240
&lrm;Don't talk about me like that!

04:50.480 --> 04:53.320
&lrm;You've made a big mistake.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.520
&lrm;You really stood up for Cheng.
&lrm;He would have appreciated that.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.520
&lrm;I'm not sure.
&lrm;I don't think he likes me.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.160
&lrm;No, you're wrong.

05:02.560 --> 05:05.760
&lrm;No, I swear.
&lrm;He ripped up the bouquet I gave him.

05:06.240 --> 05:09.160
&lrm;Cheng Sifu isn't just a chef,
&lrm;he's an artist.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.880
&lrm;He said he was gonna put
&lrm;flowers in his soup.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.560
&lrm;He improvises
&lrm;on fateful things that happen.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.760
&lrm;The flowers must be yours.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.040
&lrm;So... you think
&lrm;he actually likes me?

05:20.200 --> 05:21.200
&lrm;Totally.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.520
&lrm;He's shown you great respect,
&lrm;in his own special way.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.480
&lrm;Marinette wasn't there.

<i>&lrm;Let's get tasting!</i>

06:48.640 --> 06:49.600
&lrm;What is this?

06:53.040 --> 06:55.480
&lrm;I don't think it would fare well
&lrm;with our guests.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.200
&lrm;I'll give it 3.

06:57.360 --> 07:01.320
&lrm;Seeing as it seems unappetizing,
&lrm;I'll pass on the tasting

07:01.480 --> 07:03.440
&lrm;but I'll still give it a 0.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.400

&lrm;I'm sorry, but it's inedible.

&lrm;I give it one 1.

&lrm;[sighing]
&lrm;I... I...

07:21.400 --> 07:22.320
&lrm;I don't understand.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.920

<i>&lrm;Your Celestial Soup will not be</i>

<i>&lrm;And you will not be named</i>
<i>&lrm;World's Greatest Chef!</i>

07:50.120 --> 07:53.120
&lrm;This isn't right.
&lrm;I'm sure this is Chloe's doing.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.960
&lrm;I'd like to say you're wrong
&lrm;but I know her only too well.

07:57.760 --> 08:01.480
&lrm;Uncle Cheng,
&lrm;I'm sure it's not your fault.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.560
&lrm;I'm sure Chloe's behind this.

08:04.160 --> 08:07.160
&lrm;It was actually because of me.
&lrm;I provoked her.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.160
&lrm;Shame is on Celestial Soup.

&lrm;You'll do it, Marinette,
&lrm;I'm sure you will.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.440
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

11:24.360 --> 11:25.400
&lrm;Time to transform.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.520
&lrm;You didn't happen to pick up

11:27.680 --> 11:30.120
&lrm;a little piece
&lrm;of camembert, did you?

11:30.280 --> 11:31.720
&lrm;Cheese comes after the meal.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.760
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

11:50.840 --> 11:52.320
&lrm;-Cat Noir?
&lrm;-Ladybug?

11:52.480 --> 11:54.880
&lrm;I don't know about you
&lrm;but I'm hungry.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.640
&lrm;Let's go eat then.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.040
&lrm;Who are those two?

12:01.200 --> 12:03.080
&lrm;They're Ladybug and Cat Noir.

12:03.240 --> 12:07.560
&lrm;They've come to stop you.
&lrm;Add them to your recipe!

12:08.760 --> 12:10.480
&lrm;Surprise ingredients?

12:10.640 --> 12:11.920
&lrm;Delicious!

12:12.080 --> 12:14.800
&lrm;-You, capture them.
&lrm;-Yes, master Kung Food.

12:15.840 --> 12:19.160
&lrm;Brat Soup more powerful
&lrm;with superhero flavour.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.000
&lrm;[Chloe]
&lrm;I will not eat your soup!

12:21.680 --> 12:25.080
&lrm;Foolish girl. You are not eating soup.
&lrm;You are soup!

12:26.000 --> 12:27.840
&lrm;Help! Let me down.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.080
&lrm;Don't worry.
&lrm;You will be let down soon.

12:31.240 --> 12:32.800
&lrm;[cackling]

12:34.360 --> 12:35.760
&lrm;It's jammed.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.440
<i>&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir,</i>

12:37.600 --> 12:40.360
<i>&lrm;you soon be ingredients</i>
<i>&lrm;in Kung Food's soup</i>

12:41.160 --> 12:43.840
<i>&lrm;but first,</i>
<i>&lrm;you taste today's special.</i>

12:45.520 --> 12:46.960
&lrm;Seafood Appetisers.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.440
&lrm;Jagged Stone!

12:48.600 --> 12:51.880
&lrm;Seafood? This "scampi" happenin'.
&lrm;Can you carry a "tune-a"?

12:52.040 --> 12:53.080
&lrm;Look out!

12:54.560 --> 12:56.200
&lrm;That's not very rock 'n' roll.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.320
&lrm;Rock is one thing, soup is another.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.960
&lrm;When I'm done with you,
&lrm;you'll be mince-meat.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.640
&lrm;[he groans]

13:22.800 --> 13:23.920
&lrm;Good job.

13:24.080 --> 13:26.560
&lrm;No time to lose.
&lrm;Chloe may be the main dish.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.680
&lrm;We better not wait to find out.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.040
&lrm;Let me out!

13:31.360 --> 13:34.560
&lrm;This Brat Soup will be
&lrm;Kung Food's masterpiece.

13:34.720 --> 13:37.560
&lrm;Must you tie me up
&lrm;above this foul liquid?

13:37.720 --> 13:39.480
&lrm;My clothes will stink.

13:39.640 --> 13:43.440
&lrm;Soup not greasy at all.
&lrm;Soup very well-balanced.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.000
&lrm;[he cackles]

13:45.160 --> 13:47.360
<i>&lrm;-Let me outta here.</i>
&lrm;-Bad sous-chef!

13:50.040 --> 13:51.840
&lrm;You, do me justice!

13:52.000 --> 13:53.520
&lrm;Yes, master.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.000
&lrm;Ladybug, come on.
&lrm;It's just you and me together.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.520
&lrm;We could go places.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.200
&lrm;Yeah, like up.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.480
&lrm;Yeah, we've nowhere to go but up.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.240
&lrm;You spoke too soon.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.320
&lrm;The electricity between us
&lrm;caused a short-circuit.

14:10.480 --> 14:14.200
&lrm;You wish. More like us getting
&lrm;ourselves into a sticky mess.

14:14.360 --> 14:15.560
&lrm;[lift beeps]

14:17.000 --> 14:20.480
&lrm;Royal hotpot,
&lrm;with its giant smoked sausages.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.440
&lrm;Looks like a food-fight.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.880
&lrm;I prefer my sausages with mash.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.960
&lrm;Welcome to the world-famous
&lrm;Suite 36 of this hotel.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.240
&lrm;If we're not careful,
&lrm;we'll be the mash.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.480
&lrm;You're no competition, Ladybug.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.560
&lrm;Time to pick up the bill, Kung Food.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.520
&lrm;Grab Cat Noir's Miraculous.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.520
&lrm;His ring, bring it to me.
&lrm;Do it now!

15:09.360 --> 15:11.080
&lrm;Wrong superhero, Bourgeois!

15:11.240 --> 15:14.000
&lrm;I bet you don't know how to do this.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.600
&lrm;Really, Ladybug?

15:28.680 --> 15:31.840
&lrm;Nice work, Milady.
&lrm;Shall we go find the head chef?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.080
&lrm;Pea-brain! Useless!

15:35.240 --> 15:37.520
&lrm;My recipe not perfect
&lrm;without those two.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.920
&lrm;Capture them! And don't mess up,
&lrm;or you end up in soup.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.320
&lrm;[together]
&lrm;Yes, master.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.320
&lrm;My hair is ruined.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.200
&lrm;Do you know
&lrm;how long it took to style it?

15:47.360 --> 15:48.920
&lrm;That won't be a problem soon.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.560
&lrm;Ladybug, help me!

15:55.960 --> 15:57.120
&lrm;We're almost there.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.440
&lrm;This fighting has made me hungry.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.040
<i>&lrm;Kung Food is generous.</i>

16:01.200 --> 16:03.480
<i>&lrm;No need to choose</i>
<i>&lrm;between cheese and dessert.</i>

16:03.640 --> 16:05.640
<i>&lrm;You get both.</i>
&lrm;[lift beeps]

16:06.720 --> 16:11.040
&lrm;Watch this spectacular demonstration
&lrm;of the famous Flying Cakes.

16:19.160 --> 16:22.240
&lrm;Our guests seem to have
&lrm;a few tricks up their sleeves

16:22.400 --> 16:25.680
&lrm;but how will they fair
&lrm;against the Stinky Cheese Bomb?

16:29.640 --> 16:31.960
&lrm;These cheese stings your eyes.

16:46.280 --> 16:49.520
&lrm;[Alec laughs]
&lrm;You're no match for my... Hey!

16:55.360 --> 16:58.280
&lrm;It's about time
&lrm;for second course.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.280
&lrm;[Chloe whimpers]

17:04.440 --> 17:09.119
&lrm;Temperature is just right.
&lrm;Time to add main ingredient.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.920
&lrm;No, no, no, no!

17:13.400 --> 17:15.000
&lrm;No!

17:21.119 --> 17:24.440
&lrm;Ladybug? What took you so long?
&lrm;Wait till I tell everyone...

17:25.520 --> 17:26.319
&lrm;Oops.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.920
&lrm;No! My Brat Soup
&lrm;will be so flavourless.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.520
&lrm;You're more honourable than this,
&lrm;Cheng Sifu.

17:31.800 --> 17:36.520
&lrm;I am not Cheng Sifu. I am Kung Food,
&lrm;the greatest chef in world!

17:36.680 --> 17:40.160
&lrm;Nobody will stop me
&lrm;from finishing my Brat Soup!

17:42.400 --> 17:43.440
&lrm;Get back, Chloe.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.840
&lrm;I take care of you two myself!

17:56.320 --> 17:58.680
&lrm;Cat Noir,
&lrm;the Akuma must be in his hat.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.080
&lrm;Try to grab it.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.080
&lrm;It burns!

18:04.240 --> 18:05.800
&lrm;[cackling]
&lrm;Like it spicy?

18:06.400 --> 18:08.160
&lrm;Lucky charm!

18:12.560 --> 18:13.960
&lrm;A check?

18:14.120 --> 18:15.760
&lrm;It's gonna be a steep one.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.400
&lrm;Think you can beat me
&lrm;with a piece of paper?

18:22.560 --> 18:25.840
&lrm;You've been trying to defeat us
&lrm;with sausages and cheese

18:26.000 --> 18:27.280
&lrm;without any luck.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.400
&lrm;Cat Noir, destroy his bag.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.560
&lrm;Got it.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.320
&lrm;Cataclysm!

19:07.840 --> 19:09.560
&lrm;Your days are over, Akuma.

19:17.720 --> 19:20.320
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

19:23.680 --> 19:24.480
&lrm;Gotcha!

19:25.640 --> 19:27.440
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.160
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

19:44.240 --> 19:47.200
&lrm;This evil dinner was almost perfect.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.120
&lrm;Revenge is a dish
&lrm;that's best served cold

19:50.280 --> 19:54.520
&lrm;so watch yourself because
&lrm;I'll be ready to strike again!

19:58.960 --> 20:01.680
&lrm;Could you teach me
&lrm;how to make Celestial Soup?

20:01.840 --> 20:04.400
&lrm;With pleasure, Marinette.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.000
&lrm;Cooking needs no words.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.800
&lrm;Seriously? Still making soup?

20:09.960 --> 20:11.600
&lrm;I told you I hate soup.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.800
&lrm;Do you think
&lrm;the jury will approve?

20:13.960 --> 20:15.840
&lrm;Didn't your father
&lrm;kick you off the jury?

20:16.200 --> 20:20.160
&lrm;No, he didn't.
&lrm;I... I... I resigned.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.800
&lrm;I think Cheng and Marinette
&lrm;have it covered.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.760
&lrm;Let's let the real jury decide.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.480
&lrm;Ridiculous!

20:26.640 --> 20:28.400
&lrm;Utterly ridiculous!

20:29.120 --> 20:32.920
<i>&lrm;Cheng Sifu, your Celestial Soup</i>
<i>&lrm;received the highest marks,</i>

20:33.080 --> 20:35.280
<i>&lrm;making you the final winner!</i>

20:36.880 --> 20:39.040
<i>&lrm;And it will be the "Mayor's Special"</i>

20:39.200 --> 20:42.000
<i>&lrm;on the restaurant menu</i>
<i>&lrm;of my prestigious hotel.</i>

20:42.640 --> 20:43.680
<i>&lrm;Rock 'n' roll!</i>

20:43.840 --> 20:47.040
<i>&lrm;I can't wait to get home</i>
<i>&lrm;and write a song about soup.</i>

20:47.640 --> 20:50.080
&lrm;Thank you
&lrm;but no longer Celestial Soup,

20:50.240 --> 20:51.720
&lrm;now called Marinette Soup.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.240
&lrm;[in Chinese]
&lrm;Thank you.

20:54.400 --> 20:55.240
&lrm;You're welcome.

20:55.360 --> 20:58.600
&lrm;Come stand next to your uncle,
&lrm;the World's Greatest Chef.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.720
&lrm;[cheering]
