NARRATOR: <i>Coming tonight</i>
<i>on </i>Hill Street Blues…

00:03.503 --> 00:07.090
Operation Everglades requires
an annual search of the sewers

00:07.173 --> 00:09.092
for alligators by this department.

00:09.175 --> 00:12.554
I have been receiving obscene phone calls!

00:12.637 --> 00:15.306
Francis is slated
for divisional commander.

00:15.390 --> 00:18.476
If this street-killing's
no big deal, why you, Emil?

00:18.560 --> 00:21.604
Somebody must've liked her,
recruited her off the Hill.

00:21.688 --> 00:25.525
You think that's okay, Nemo?
Fourteen-year-old girls?

00:25.608 --> 00:27.402
-Sex club.
-That's right.

00:27.485 --> 00:28.820
With juvenile performers.

00:28.903 --> 00:30.947
Can I go home with you tonight?

00:35.994 --> 00:36.995
ESTERHAUS: Item 11

00:38.038 --> 00:43.251
concerns a gang of alleged
juveniles of varying sexes

00:44.085 --> 00:47.672
displaying their private parts
to vehicular traffic…

00:47.756 --> 00:50.508
-(everyone laughing)
-…on the Harding Expressway.

00:51.885 --> 00:57.474
The alleged intent of which being
to distract motorists into accidents.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.351
We've had three to date.

01:01.728 --> 01:05.065
So, what's say we button up
the problem forthwith

01:07.567 --> 01:11.237
and put some attention
on those overpasses.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.284
All right. Next item is item 12.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.370
Be reminded that Operation Everglades

01:19.454 --> 01:22.332
is under way as of 0700 this morning.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.918
Those of you new to the Hill
may or may not know

01:25.001 --> 01:27.754
that the sanitation workers' contract
with the city requires

01:27.837 --> 01:30.465
an annual search
of the sewers for alligators

01:30.548 --> 01:31.633
by this department.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.384
-(murmuring)
-Said reptiles,

01:33.468 --> 01:36.763
transported here in their infancy
as souvenirs of Florida,

01:36.846 --> 01:41.309
have been known to achieve
eight feet in length…

01:41.392 --> 01:44.395
-(whistles)
-(laughing)

01:44.479 --> 01:46.731
…and represent an alleged danger

01:46.815 --> 01:48.942
-to sanitation workers.
-(talking inaudibly)

01:50.819 --> 01:52.779
It's a tough, thankless job down there,

01:52.862 --> 01:55.532
-more difficult than people imagine.
-(talking inaudibly)

01:56.491 --> 01:59.786
So, let's be alert
to that operation under the streets,

02:00.453 --> 02:04.124
making sure that all storm drains
and manhole covers

02:04.207 --> 02:05.458
remain accessible.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.168
Any questions?

02:08.586 --> 02:10.213
All right. That's it. Let's roll.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.174
Hey,

02:14.175 --> 02:17.053
-let's be careful out there.
-(chairs scraping)

02:17.137 --> 02:18.805
(indistinct chatter)

02:23.768 --> 02:27.188
Judas Priest, Frank. I will not have
this operation compromised.

02:27.272 --> 02:30.900
If you ask me, it is a carbon copy
of last year's fun and games

02:30.984 --> 02:32.610
with the S.P.C.A.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.196
Carbon copy, and make no mistake, Frank.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.489
Look, Howard,

02:36.573 --> 02:39.367
why don't we try to see this
from Mr. Bromfield's perspective?

02:39.450 --> 02:40.368
It's Dewey, man.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.664
Last year, he was accidentally darted
and spent nine days…

02:44.747 --> 02:47.417
-In a coma, man.
-…unconscious.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.501
(sighs)

02:48.585 --> 02:51.379
We have been through this
time and again, Frank.

02:51.462 --> 02:54.382
The man literally threw himself
into the field of fire,

02:54.465 --> 02:56.968
screaming ecological gibberish.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.553
What amazes me is that he's back,

02:58.636 --> 03:01.139
that he hasn't been dismissed
for mental incapacity.

03:01.222 --> 03:04.100
-The dude's a maniac, man. He's twisted.
-Mr. Bromfield feels that

03:04.184 --> 03:07.061
if he carries
the tranquilizer darts personally,

03:07.145 --> 03:09.063
there's less chance of his being

03:09.147 --> 03:11.649
accidentally darted on the way
to your command post.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.443
Well, then, where the hell is he?

03:13.526 --> 03:17.071
I have nine crack emergency action squads

03:17.155 --> 03:20.200
parked on their duffs here
for going on three hours.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.994
Uh, he'll be using the, uh,

03:23.077 --> 03:24.996
-the entrance of the manhole…
-I'm all right.

03:25.079 --> 03:28.124
They should leave them be down there, man.
They scarf up on the rats.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.293
It's a natural balance, like.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.837
FURILLO (over radio):
<i>Say, uh, 10, 15 minutes?</i>

03:32.921 --> 03:34.839
Yeah, I'm on my way, Captain.

03:36.299 --> 03:39.219
Oh, say, within the half hour.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.305
Well, get the tranquilizer
down here, will ya?

03:42.388 --> 03:43.306
Yeah.

03:45.433 --> 03:46.976
Alligators.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.521
See, people don't understand them, man.
They're afraid of them.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.440
-Let me ask you this.
-(meows)

03:52.523 --> 03:54.984
How many people you know of
been hurt by alligators?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.653
How many people been robbed?

03:58.863 --> 04:02.033
Ever get any cookies come in here
say they've been raped by alligators?

04:02.116 --> 04:04.869
Hey, Dewey, what do you say?

04:04.953 --> 04:07.288
Let's give those guys down there a break.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.207
Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.585
(meows)

04:13.544 --> 04:17.048
Oh, uh, listen, if I don't come back,

04:17.966 --> 04:20.093
-it's been nice knowing you, Henry.
-Dewey.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.895
The man does make a lot of sense.

04:30.979 --> 04:31.980
Yeah.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.817
Oh, Henry, uh,

04:36.901 --> 04:39.362
let's see what, uh, we can do

04:39.445 --> 04:41.781
about some unauthorized personnel, okay?

04:41.864 --> 04:42.740
No problem.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.742
I'll have him in a foster home
in five minutes.

04:44.826 --> 04:48.454
-Good, Henry.
-(door opens, closes)

04:48.538 --> 04:51.082
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:51.165 --> 04:53.293
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:53.376 --> 04:57.171
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:04.178 --> 05:08.099
(theme music playing)

06:10.286 --> 06:12.246
He's been here three times before.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.124
I don't know what you're going to do,
but you have to do something.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.168
I don't either, because he won't listen--

06:17.251 --> 06:21.464
Ray, I'm trying to understand
exactly what transpired in roll call.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.217
That homicide up on East Detroit, Phil.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.053
Night watch was two hours into overtime.

06:27.136 --> 06:29.972
Be that as it may, Ray.
We are all part of a system up here,

06:30.056 --> 06:32.517
and that system demands
a certain protocol!

06:32.600 --> 06:36.312
Uniforms deal with uniforms,
plainclothes with plainclothes.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.940
-When you invaded roll call--
-Bother you a minute, Phil?

06:39.023 --> 06:41.067
-Hi, Ray. Hang on to him for five minutes.
-What?

06:41.150 --> 06:43.653
I swear I'll have him situated
ten minutes at the most.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.738
Ooh, ooh. Oh, Henry, please.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.826
As I was saying, Lieutenant,
when you invaded roll call just now,

06:49.909 --> 06:53.579
that system of protocol
sustained irrevocable damage.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.874
That's a little strong, wouldn't you say?

06:56.958 --> 07:00.336
Maybe you'd like to reword that a little.

07:00.420 --> 07:04.674
ESTERHAUS: I don't see the need to reword
what's been perfectly worded.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.718
-Whoo. Yeah, you tell it to him, cat man.
-(speaking foreign language)

07:07.802 --> 07:10.680
-In the chops, man.
-(speaking foreign language)

07:10.763 --> 07:12.348
You wait till your father comes.

07:12.432 --> 07:16.310
Excuse me a minute, lady.
You keep your mouth shut.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.608
You had to start this in front of them?

07:22.692 --> 07:25.027
I suppose that's protocol.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.822
Ray, it's not easy
keeping that herd awake,

07:27.905 --> 07:29.699
much less under control.

07:29.782 --> 07:33.244
What you did
seriously undercuts my authority.

07:33.327 --> 07:36.789
I've seen you issue orders
to plainclothes, Phil.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.208
LaRue, Belker, Delgado, Washington.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.254
-I won't deny that.
-It's the nature of the beast up here.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.548
Things sometimes happen too fast.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.593
Enough said. I'm in the wrong.
Discussion closed.

07:48.676 --> 07:52.305
No, you don't. All that says
is you're still mad about it.

07:53.222 --> 07:55.933
I am not mad about it.
Here, let me get you a cup of coffee.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.186
Uh, that's okay. You got your hands full.

07:58.269 --> 08:01.147
-No, I don't.
-Uh--

08:01.230 --> 08:04.609
Let me do it. I want to pour you a cup.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.195
Thank you, Ray.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.656
(family arguing)

08:10.740 --> 08:11.949
Thank you.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.038
-(shouting)
-Hey, who… who cares? I don't care.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.248
(both shouting in foreign language)

08:20.249 --> 08:22.460
You are so smart.
You're always doing it by yourself.

08:22.543 --> 08:23.628
BOY: I don't care.

08:24.962 --> 08:27.173
Part of the new
family counseling program, Ray?

08:27.256 --> 08:29.884
(arguing continues)

08:29.967 --> 08:31.928
That homicide investigation
wrapped up fast.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.471
I didn't expect you back till noon.

08:33.554 --> 08:37.391
Division has it.
Emil Schneider, he's heading it.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.810
Schneider? Sounds big.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.104
Well, it must be to take Ray here off it.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.607
We all know Ray's one of the best.

08:52.698 --> 08:56.327
(upbeat music playing)

09:00.081 --> 09:02.500
HILL: Okay, would you all
back up against the wall?

09:02.583 --> 09:04.669
Please, ma'am, come over to the side.
Thank you.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.963
-(Renko, indistinct)
-Back up. Please, back up.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.299
<i>Cuidado, por favor.</i>
<i>Cuidado, por favor. Gracias.</i>

09:19.016 --> 09:21.936
-MAN: What else?
-Two of the fingernails on her right hand,

09:22.019 --> 09:24.230
the forefinger and the middle finger,
were broken.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.274
They're false nails, not real fingernails.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.358
Good.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.570
-What else?
-Marks on her wrists

09:30.653 --> 09:33.239
and three of her fingers
indicate she was wearing jewelry.

09:33.322 --> 09:37.159
I'd say, what with the hairdo,
the big-ticket clothes,

09:37.243 --> 09:39.620
she was one good-looking woman,
Lieutenant.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.498
Call girl, maybe. Maybe worked the hotels.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.459
Don't be in too much of a rush, huh, kid?

09:46.502 --> 09:48.921
WOMAN: <i>Sí. Sí, no hay problema.</i>

09:49.005 --> 09:51.674
Your protégés here crack it yet, Emil?

09:51.757 --> 09:54.385
Dann's got her connected back
to working call girl

09:54.468 --> 09:55.803
at the Savoy Ritz Hotel.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.472
Thinks she got done in by…

09:58.556 --> 10:01.225
what would you say, Dann, secret agents?

10:01.309 --> 10:03.060
Yeah, Bulgarians, Lieutenant.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.396
It's all yours, Emil. We're done.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.898
Uh, make some room here.

10:08.816 --> 10:11.944
These people, I swear.
I had a victim two days ago

10:12.028 --> 10:14.947
got terminated over
a bottle of grape juice.

10:16.198 --> 10:18.200
-Learn them good, Emil. See ya.
-Mm-hmm.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.661
WOMAN: <i>Ven aquí. No hay problema.</i>

10:20.745 --> 10:23.080
Don't worry about it. It's fun fur.

10:24.832 --> 10:28.085
Uh, Lieutenant,
I think you're mistaken there.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.838
Something on your mind, Officer?

10:30.921 --> 10:34.216
No, no. It's just that
that's a genuine fox collar.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.636
And that's a cashmere sweater.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.221
-Is that a fact?
-Yeah. As a matter of fact,

10:39.305 --> 10:40.848
I got my mama one last Christmas.

10:40.931 --> 10:43.267
-You were with me, Bobby. Remember?
-Where?

10:43.351 --> 10:46.270
She says it's hers.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.938
She says she loaned it to the victim,

10:48.022 --> 10:50.191
and she's afraid
she's not gonna get it back.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.779
It's okay. It's not important.
Stay with her a couple of hours, huh?

10:55.404 --> 10:58.115
-(indistinct chatter)
-I don't remember.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.911
Hill Street blues.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.497
Say hello to Furillo for me, huh?

11:05.289 --> 11:06.248
Yes, sir.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.210
Fur expert. "Murray the Furrier."

11:10.670 --> 11:13.255
-"Murray the Furrier," that's you.
-What you talking about?

11:13.339 --> 11:16.384
-I don't even know what he means.
-You're butting in his business again.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.552
-Why don't you just be quiet one time?
-So are you.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.638
MAN 1: You men want to
check your flashlights?

11:20.721 --> 11:22.181
MAN 2: I just checked. Mine's good.

11:22.264 --> 11:24.725
Got a couple of
prune Danish here, Lieutenant.

11:24.809 --> 11:28.104
Apricot, cherry. Looks like chocolate.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.855
Ahh. (puffs)

11:30.773 --> 11:32.316
Good enterprise, Devlin.

11:33.442 --> 11:36.862
You know, the dampness down here
is known to sap calories.

11:49.917 --> 11:52.294
That whole section of Von Steuben Avenue

11:52.378 --> 11:55.089
above the projects is Sniper Alley.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.425
The gas company
ought to know better than to go up there

11:57.508 --> 11:59.343
without a police escort.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.722
Hey, we don't go up there ourselves
unless we have to.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.058
And even then,
we dispatch three or four units at a time.

12:08.018 --> 12:09.353
WOMAN: Hill Street Station.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.231
I got your report, Supervisor.

12:12.314 --> 12:13.649
It is being matriculated

12:13.733 --> 12:16.235
to the proper functionaries
of this agency.

12:18.362 --> 12:23.242
Gas company casually dispatches
a repair truck to Sniper Alley.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.203
Got riddled with rifle fire.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.539
Here, Ray.

12:29.707 --> 12:32.585
It's carrot cake. Cream cheese frosting.

12:32.668 --> 12:34.420
I can't. Look.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.464
It's a little piece.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.757
(sighs)

12:39.175 --> 12:40.259
Thanks.

12:40.342 --> 12:44.764
Uh, makes a wicked carrot cake, my Cindy.
The frosting's mine.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.516
We baked it dressed in our bathing suits.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.226
(laughing)

12:49.310 --> 12:51.854
Moist. Very moist.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.648
Do you gentlemen have some reason
for not being out on the streets

12:54.732 --> 12:56.609
providing service to the public?

13:02.865 --> 13:05.159
Well, we put out an A.P.B.
on the tenant of record,

13:05.242 --> 13:07.161
this here Nemo Rodriguez character,

13:07.244 --> 13:09.163
the suspected boyfriend of the victim.

13:09.246 --> 13:14.335
Uh, her name is Maria Cuajarda,
or Maria Escala Sofias,

13:14.418 --> 13:17.046
uh… uh, whatever you want
to believe from her I.D.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.173
One says she's 21. One says she's 18.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.383
The boyfriend's gone, I take it.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.261
He's a probie. Long record
back when he was with the gangs.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.430
-The Dragons.
-The Dragons, I think.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.349
Look, Lieutenant Schneider

13:28.432 --> 13:30.935
says the kid shot her,
ripped off her jewelry and split.

13:31.018 --> 13:34.230
-So, what's got your nose so out of joint?
-You should have seen her, Captain.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.940
She was real, real good looking.

13:36.023 --> 13:39.443
She had a beautiful face,
hair, eyes, body, makeup, uh--

13:39.527 --> 13:41.445
There's no way some 10-cent probie

13:41.529 --> 13:43.697
is gonna keep a woman like that
in a tenement.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.658
How does the victim's aunt
tie into all this?

13:45.741 --> 13:48.035
-Well, this Nemo--
-The aunt-- The aunt was…

13:48.744 --> 13:51.622
This Nemo Rodriguez
was splitting the rent with her, I guess.

13:51.705 --> 13:53.082
Who knows what else?

13:53.165 --> 13:54.583
She said she took a sleeping pill

13:54.667 --> 13:55.876
-about 9:00.
-9:00.

13:57.586 --> 14:00.673
Uh, ex-- excuse me, Captain.
She sleeps in the front room.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.258
She woke up at 5:00 in the morning

14:02.341 --> 14:04.552
and found the body
lying on the kitchen floor.

14:04.635 --> 14:07.763
You're not nearly
as bothered by this as he is.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.351
You want to ride this one, Cowboy?

14:13.561 --> 14:15.813
Well, uh, when I was in the apartment,

14:15.896 --> 14:18.107
I made a mention
to the lieutenant of a-- of a--

14:18.190 --> 14:21.277
What "Murray the Furrier"
is refusing to say, Captain,

14:21.360 --> 14:23.529
-is that he got his wrist slapped.
-I did not.

14:24.321 --> 14:27.283
Now, look, here he is,
this big lieutenant,

14:27.366 --> 14:30.578
walking around, showing off
to all these big college boys

14:30.661 --> 14:32.621
who are gonna be detectives someday.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.958
Instead of using the brains God gave 'em,
they're looking down their noses

14:36.041 --> 14:38.168
at me and Bobby,
who maybe is used to it, but I'm not.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.713
What are you talking about?
You don't know what I'm used to.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.381
You want to be a Homicide cop? Do it.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.592
-But you don't tell me what I'm used to--
-I'm not--

14:44.675 --> 14:46.635
-You don't know anything about it.
-I'm not--

14:46.719 --> 14:48.262
-You just said it.
-I made a mistake.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.930
Wait a minute. Hold it.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.893
L-Let me see if I understand
what you're telling me here.

14:53.976 --> 14:57.897
Uh, you aspire to being
a Homicide detective,

14:57.980 --> 14:59.273
-and you don't.
-Right.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.567
And you,

15:01.650 --> 15:03.235
more so than you,

15:03.319 --> 15:05.779
have the feeling that
Detective Lieutenant Schneider

15:05.863 --> 15:08.699
is just waltzing his way
through a homicide investigation.

15:08.782 --> 15:09.742
Is that right?

15:11.493 --> 15:12.703
(sighs)

15:13.954 --> 15:17.291
I just won't have people saying I'm stupid
'cause I wear a uniform.

15:18.542 --> 15:19.752
I'm not stupid.

15:20.961 --> 15:21.795
Hill?

15:23.339 --> 15:24.798
I got no problems.

15:25.716 --> 15:28.260
Just seems kinda strange that, uh,

15:28.344 --> 15:30.638
if this is your basic homicide/robbery

15:30.721 --> 15:33.432
that a heavyweight like Schneider
would be running the case.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.226
Thanks for your input.

15:39.021 --> 15:42.733
(upbeat music playing)

15:54.662 --> 15:56.038
Hello.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.999
Yeah.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.880
(whistles) Mmm, it' a lot bigger
than I remember.

16:04.964 --> 16:05.881
Yeah.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.510
Hey, the wheels look like
they might need oiling, babe.

16:09.593 --> 16:12.012
-Here, check the wheels. (coughing)
-All right.

16:13.555 --> 16:14.765
Mmm.

16:16.767 --> 16:17.726
(clears throat)

16:17.810 --> 16:20.312
-Wheels check.
-(sighs)

16:20.396 --> 16:23.148
Hey, I just realized something.
It's a female.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.651
Which means what?
You wanna take her to dinner?

16:26.360 --> 16:29.071
Cruel words, my man. What are you
trying to do, break my spirit?

16:29.154 --> 16:31.115
-Come on. Let's get it out of here.
-Right.

16:33.909 --> 16:36.161
The liquor license
comes with the premises, man,

16:36.245 --> 16:37.788
and the dude wants out.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.834
He's asking 15 grand,
but I know he'll take ten.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.545
-What do you know about running a bar?
-I know enough.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.547
You know how to drink is what you know.

16:48.799 --> 16:51.010
Come on, man.
Are you gonna stand there and tell me

16:51.093 --> 16:53.721
that between the two of us
we don't have the smarts to run a bar,

16:53.804 --> 16:55.097
let alone a laundromat?

16:56.265 --> 17:01.061
(panting): Get serious, will ya?
It's a guaranteed winner.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.772
We'll have franchises in 200 cities.

17:08.068 --> 17:09.653
I see it all now.

17:09.737 --> 17:10.863
"Saloondromat:

17:10.946 --> 17:15.826
the ultimate in singles laundromat
and cocktail lounge."

17:15.909 --> 17:18.412
Fluff and fold wallbangers. Jesus.

17:18.495 --> 17:20.914
(engine starts)

17:20.998 --> 17:23.751
LARUE: 10K for remodeling and
we're in business for 20 grand.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.170
-(Washington whistles)
-Less than four weeks' gross,

17:26.253 --> 17:27.713
according to one's figures here.

17:27.796 --> 17:31.675
Those figures say anything about
where one comes up with $20,000, huh?

17:31.759 --> 17:34.762
One happens to already
be into me for 3,200 now, you know.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.221
We're even.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.433
One's giving you three and 2/10ths shares
in the company.

17:39.516 --> 17:42.895
Oh, wow. Lucky me.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.230
(indistinct chatter)

17:50.486 --> 17:51.487
(clears throat)

17:53.405 --> 17:56.283
We got a special Mayday line
we're hooking up.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.702
We're gonna have a red phone
in the captain's office,

17:58.786 --> 18:00.996
and then a red phone at the front desk.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.208
Any problems? You look concerned, Officer.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.250
(chuckling)

18:05.334 --> 18:07.711
Everything is just fine, Commander.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.172
Everything is just fine, Commander.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.298
Good.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.968
You know, you look good, Phil.
Been working out, I'll bet.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.929
Well, I have.

18:18.138 --> 18:21.391
You have to have
that celery sticking outta your face?

18:21.475 --> 18:25.395
-It's unsightly.
-This is roughage.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.648
The doctor says I need roughage.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.902
Last week he says protein.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.571
I don't think he knows
what the hell is the matter.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.824
Mmm, you been staying regular?

18:36.907 --> 18:39.993
Yeah. Every two weeks. Like clockwork.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.913
I gotta admit, you don't really look good.

18:42.996 --> 18:44.873
How about giving my guy a call?

18:44.957 --> 18:47.918
He's outstanding. Enormously thorough man.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.380
All right. I'll try it.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.633
He's in the Bockner building.
Sterling Wu, Internal Medicine.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.010
He's an Oriental gentleman.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.597
Wait a minute.
He's not the one I heard about, is he?

19:01.598 --> 19:03.517
Guy who puts leeches all over ya?

19:04.393 --> 19:07.646
Do I look like the kind of guy
who would permit leeches on his body?

19:12.734 --> 19:14.611
The fellow they sent over
from the S.P.C.A.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.906
-hasn't hooked up with Hunter yet.
-Hmm. Let's hope he's not lost down there.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.950
Well, he's carrying
the tranquilizing dart.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.368
No dart, no operation.

19:21.451 --> 19:24.580
Hunter is not exactly
in a congenial frame of mind.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.374
Score one for the alligators.
I'm on their side.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.669
Here. Thought I'd deliver this in person.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.763
-You wanna crow a little?
-(chuckles)

19:41.847 --> 19:43.432
Flap your wings? Go ahead.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.394
You'd make a hell
of a good commander, Frank,

19:47.477 --> 19:49.563
and I want you with me up at Division.

19:50.772 --> 19:53.817
Oh, that means you're going up
to deputy chief. Congratulations.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.445
-Not that it surprises anyone.
-Surprised me.

19:56.528 --> 19:59.573
-Yeah, like hell.
-You're up against a good guy, Frank.

19:59.656 --> 20:00.741
Ed Chapel.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.077
I know Ed. He's-- He is good.

20:04.161 --> 20:07.706
You outscored him by a couple of points.
You've got the edge in seniority.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.708
But let's face it, Ed's a political guy.

20:09.791 --> 20:12.169
He likes people, and people like him.

20:12.252 --> 20:16.131
-He's active. He gets around.
-(Hunter on phone, indistinct)

20:16.215 --> 20:18.342
Uh, excuse me. Uh…

20:19.509 --> 20:23.180
All right. I… I think you're jumping
to conclusions, Howard.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.474
It is a deliberate ruse
to abort this operation,

20:25.557 --> 20:27.559
and I will not be played a fool, Frank.

20:27.643 --> 20:31.438
-I have nine squads.
-(men chattering indistinctly)

20:31.521 --> 20:33.649
We've been searching for him
for two bloody hours,

20:33.732 --> 20:36.652
and I don't need you to tell me
when to execute a search.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.613
Suppose you wait
for Mr. Bromfield until midday,

20:39.696 --> 20:43.367
and then cancel
the operation until, say, uh,

20:43.450 --> 20:45.327
07:00 tomorrow morning?

20:45.410 --> 20:47.329
I'll take full responsibility.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.539
HUNTER: <i>Okay. But let</i>
<i>the record show, I'm miffed.</i>

20:49.623 --> 20:51.833
I know how you feel, Howard.
I don't blame you a bit.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.585
Sure.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.213
-(receiver clatters)
-Uh.

20:58.966 --> 20:59.967
Henry.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.011
Will someone get me
Henry Goldblume, please?

21:04.763 --> 21:07.641
Everyone knows how effective you are
with the nuts and bolts, Frank.

21:07.724 --> 21:10.435
-(meows)
-But that in itself won't cut it.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.854
You've got to get active
in the Police League.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.607
Check in at Chief Daniels's
breakfast sessions.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.735
Lift one with the boys
down at Madigan's once in a while.

21:18.819 --> 21:22.155
You're under the microscope, Frank,
from now to the day.

21:22.239 --> 21:25.158
Pardon the untimely intrusion, Commander,
but I thought the captain

21:25.242 --> 21:29.705
would like to know that, uh,
River Patrol picked up Nemo Rodriguez,

21:29.788 --> 21:32.541
the suspect
in the East Detroit Street homicide.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.793
I've got Hill and Renko bringing him in.

21:34.876 --> 21:37.587
Good, Phil. You want to see me, Ches?

21:37.671 --> 21:38.755
Excuse me, Commander.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.425
Captain, we've got a positive R &amp; I
on that victim.

21:41.508 --> 21:43.885
The I.D.'s in her wallet were all phonies.

21:43.969 --> 21:48.098
Her aunt confirms
she was Rosario Rivas, age 15.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.978
Rapetto in Vice had her working
the Heads and Tails Club about a year ago.

21:53.061 --> 21:55.814
-Onstage.
-At the ripe old age of 14.

21:55.897 --> 21:58.108
-Who's on it, Frank?
-Emil Schneider.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.402
-Good.
-(Fay shouting)

22:00.485 --> 22:03.322
FAY: He knows where I work!
He knows where I live!

22:03.405 --> 22:05.782
He knows what I eat!

22:05.866 --> 22:08.660
He knows absolutely everything,

22:08.744 --> 22:11.872
including the name
of your son's orthodontist,

22:11.955 --> 22:14.333
including the color of my lingerie!

22:14.416 --> 22:18.712
And he is filthy, foul, filthy, stinking--

22:18.795 --> 22:21.715
Fay, you remember
Divisional Commander Swanson.

22:21.798 --> 22:24.176
-Hello, Fay.
-Don't hello me, Swanson.

22:24.259 --> 22:26.386
Do something! Anything!

22:26.470 --> 22:29.473
Uh, I'm sorry.
Fay seems to be a little upset.

22:29.556 --> 22:32.309
(scoffs): Upset? Me?

22:32.934 --> 22:35.187
Very perceptive, Frank. Highly perceptive.

22:35.270 --> 22:38.982
As I recall, one of the highlights
of our marriage was your keen perception.

22:39.066 --> 22:42.235
-I'll catch up with you later, Frank.
-Oh, no, you don't, mister.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.695
This concerns you, too.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.532
I called my local precinct
last night for help.

22:47.616 --> 22:51.620
And what did I get?
A tape recording of Mantovani!

22:51.703 --> 22:55.248
That filth could have broken in
and butchered me and your son

22:55.332 --> 22:57.667
while the police played Mantovani.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.461
Fay, what is your problem?

23:00.045 --> 23:03.632
I have been receiving obscene phone calls

23:03.715 --> 23:07.177
from yesterday afternoon
at 4:00 till 4:00 this morning.

23:07.928 --> 23:10.806
And I am drained, Frank.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.183
I'm at the end of my rope!

23:13.266 --> 23:14.643
(crying)

23:19.606 --> 23:21.066
It's okay to cry.

23:21.149 --> 23:23.610
I know how upsetting
these kinds of calls can be.

23:23.693 --> 23:27.697
I don't want to cry.
I just want it to stop!

23:27.781 --> 23:31.284
My God, what kind of a world is this

23:31.368 --> 23:33.787
when your own telephone
in your own bedroom

23:33.870 --> 23:36.748
becomes some sort of horrible weapon

23:36.832 --> 23:40.419
for some perverted mind
who's just free as you please,

23:40.502 --> 23:42.379
and the police don't care?

23:42.462 --> 23:45.924
-That's not true, Fay.
-Uh, what precinct is she in, Frank?

23:46.007 --> 23:48.135
-Midtown.
-I'll take care of it.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.678
See you out and around?

23:49.761 --> 23:51.513
Yeah. Thanks, Dave.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.226
Uh, look, it's okay.

23:56.309 --> 23:58.687
I mean, uh,
it's-- it's gonna be all right.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.942
(sighs)

24:05.735 --> 24:07.154
Started happening, Ray.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.281
I've been seeing it coming
for ten months now.

24:09.364 --> 24:12.200
Francis is slated
for divisional commander.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.286
We're gonna lose him.
I just saw the letter.

24:15.495 --> 24:17.122
BATES: Take a seat, Mrs. Furillo.

24:17.914 --> 24:22.002
-It's not for publication.
-You absolutely sure?

24:22.085 --> 24:24.754
Sure as I am
that this department's long overdue

24:24.838 --> 24:29.092
for its first Hispanic precinct captain.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.970
How do you suppose he knew that?

24:32.053 --> 24:34.222
I mean, do you mark it on a calendar, or…?

24:35.056 --> 24:38.101
-No.
-How we doing, Fay? Feeling better?

24:38.185 --> 24:39.144
-(sighs)
-Huh?

24:39.227 --> 24:40.979
Yeah. I am now.

24:41.062 --> 24:44.733
You know, just knowing
somebody cares helps.

24:45.567 --> 24:49.279
At 4:00 in the morning,
with, uh, no husband, it's…

24:50.614 --> 24:53.325
Well, I think you both know
what I'm talking about.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.995
You know, Fay,
as traumatic as these calls are,

24:57.913 --> 25:02.042
I wouldn't worry about the caller doing
what he threatens doing.

25:02.626 --> 25:06.880
-It's true.
-They're sick, lonely, cowardly types.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.883
They can't do anything but dial a phone.

25:09.966 --> 25:11.343
I know.

25:11.426 --> 25:14.429
Of course, there was
the Clausen case not long ago.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.306
What's the Clausen case?

25:17.474 --> 25:19.184
Sergeant.

25:19.267 --> 25:20.769
Oh, you don't want to know, Fay.

25:20.852 --> 25:21.978
I'm sorry.

25:22.062 --> 25:24.564
She did live though. He was put away.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.943
(chuckles): It's nice seeing you, Fay.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.779
I'm sure you've got
nothing to worry about.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.995
(indistinct station chatter)

25:40.830 --> 25:41.957
Right in there.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.503
-Booking.
-FURILLO: Have him Mirandized,

25:46.586 --> 25:48.463
and in both English and Spanish.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.257
And take him into interrogation

25:50.340 --> 25:53.093
and don't let anybody talk to him
till Schneider gets there.

25:53.176 --> 25:55.554
-How about his phone call?
-Absolutely.

25:56.846 --> 25:58.932
-Frank?
-Yeah.

25:59.015 --> 26:00.767
What's the Heads and Tails Club?

26:01.768 --> 26:04.563
Private club. Top of the Fairmont Manor.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.815
-Sex club.
-That's right.

26:06.898 --> 26:10.443
-With juvenile performers.
-Yes, some.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.488
Vice has tried closing it down
for years, Henry,

26:14.072 --> 26:16.866
but it's got an, uh,
influential membership.

26:17.617 --> 26:19.578
Besides, it's Midtown's problem.

26:19.661 --> 26:21.413
It's a 14-year-old girl.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.374
Seems to me that's everybody's problem.

26:26.001 --> 26:26.835
I can't be--

26:26.918 --> 26:29.421
How can this department know
about it and not do anything?

26:30.130 --> 26:32.632
And don't tell me it's victimless.
We know better than that.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.177
I'm sorry. I--

26:36.261 --> 26:37.846
I just can't seem to get it off my mind.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.433
Me neither, Henry.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.896
(door opens)

26:46.980 --> 26:48.690
-(typing)
-RENKO: Yeah, okay.

26:48.773 --> 26:51.610
No, the only thing I called Division about
was about the address.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.612
-We don't know the address.
-(sighs)

26:53.695 --> 26:55.905
(sighs): He left the book. I know.

26:55.989 --> 26:57.282
It's the yellow copy.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.952
RENKO: Robert Hill.
It should be in the files turned in.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.120
It was turned in.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.873
Yeah, I'm well aware of that. Thank you.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.292
I'll hold.

27:14.424 --> 27:17.385
(indistinct radio chatter)

27:17.469 --> 27:20.388
Good work. Uh, now cage him
and get him out of here.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.308
-MAN: Hold him steady.
-Do we tie him up first

27:23.391 --> 27:24.726
or just put him in the cage?

27:24.809 --> 27:27.562
-Keep track of where we are now.
-Keep our hands out of the cage.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.981
There should be more.
Where there's one, there's more.

27:31.232 --> 27:34.527
Oh, if I were
writing my memoirs, Snellkirk,

27:34.611 --> 27:39.449
I would entitle this little episode,
<i>Prelude to Oblivion.</i>

27:39.532 --> 27:44.245
Ah, it's just another symptom of
this city's deteriorating nervous system.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.039
What galls me

27:46.790 --> 27:47.916
is that

27:48.958 --> 27:51.127
there's still time enough to save it.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.138
That's disgusting.

28:10.730 --> 28:14.567
(accordion music playing)

28:14.651 --> 28:16.319
(music continues)

28:16.403 --> 28:19.114
-WOMAN: I'll be right back.
-(indistinct chatter)

28:23.076 --> 28:25.620
You know how many calories
are in those French fries?

28:27.122 --> 28:29.249
-Oh, thank you, honey.
-MAN 1: Need another beer?

28:29.332 --> 28:32.293
-MAN 2: Yeah.
-After 25 years of these things,

28:32.377 --> 28:34.879
I don't know whether I'm eating them
or they're eating me.

28:36.339 --> 28:39.175
Remember when these things
used to be 35 cents?

28:39.259 --> 28:40.510
MAN: Light or dark?

28:41.428 --> 28:43.138
Club soda, please.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.889
Frank Furillo.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.893
-How ya doing, Frank?
-I'm doing just fine, Emil.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.019
You look good.

28:50.979 --> 28:54.691
Your East Detroit Street suspect,
Rodriguez, was picked up by River Patrol.

28:54.774 --> 28:58.027
-We're holding him for you.
-Hey, that's fast work.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.779
Do I have time to finish this?

29:00.655 --> 29:02.198
Maybe you better skip the buns.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.033
Ah, the bun is the best part, Frank.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.457
What's the chance your just booking
and shipping him, huh?

29:10.540 --> 29:13.126
-Save me the schlep up there?
-No chance.

29:13.209 --> 29:15.336
(music continues)

29:24.512 --> 29:25.638
Excuse me.

29:36.524 --> 29:40.528
-WOMAN: Can I have, uh--
-What's the problem, Frank? Jurisdiction?

29:40.612 --> 29:42.989
I step in somebody's rice bowl
this morning?

29:43.072 --> 29:45.617
Explain something to me, Emil.

29:45.700 --> 29:48.828
If this street killing's
no big deal, why you?

29:48.912 --> 29:51.164
Taking some kids to school, that's all.

29:51.247 --> 29:53.082
They got to learn someplace.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.835
Those two kids you sent over,

29:56.503 --> 29:59.464
the chunky kid was nursing
a wild hair of some kind.

29:59.547 --> 30:02.926
Started giving me a hard time
about the victim's sweater. (chuckles)

30:03.009 --> 30:04.803
Ah, well, they're kids.

30:06.262 --> 30:08.807
They're ambitious. Can't blame them.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.936
-How's the missus?
-That's history.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.729
You, too?

30:15.396 --> 30:16.439
(clicks tongue)

30:17.148 --> 30:22.695
Everyone in this place is either divorced,
separated, or fighting a holding action.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.239
You figure it.

30:24.322 --> 30:26.449
Rapetto over at Vice says the victim

30:26.533 --> 30:30.203
was working half-and-half
at the Heads and Tails Club.

30:30.286 --> 30:34.707
-Do you know about that?
-No. It explains a lot though. The money.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.377
Must've been a thousand bucks on her back.

30:38.878 --> 30:40.964
Hey, Frank. Good to see ya.

30:41.756 --> 30:44.801
-Hi, Ed. How ya doing?
-Good, good. Okay.

30:45.426 --> 30:46.970
-How are you, Emil?
-Ed.

30:47.887 --> 30:50.849
So, how's the world, huh? How's Fay?

30:51.891 --> 30:53.059
SCHNEIDER: Divorced.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.063
Well, join the club, Frank.

30:57.730 --> 30:59.524
Rita packed me off 18 months ago.

31:00.358 --> 31:01.651
I'm sorry to hear that.

31:03.486 --> 31:05.947
Well, there's no sense
our skirting the issue, Frank.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.201
-Looks like it's you and me.
-Mm-hmm.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.245
-I got the word this morning.
-Yeah, me, too.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.749
Well, I don't know how you feel about it.

31:16.833 --> 31:20.587
Me, I'm kind of, uh,
walking the fence, you know.

31:20.670 --> 31:23.464
A commander's a commander, but, uh…

31:24.924 --> 31:26.593
I'm a street cop, you know?

31:26.676 --> 31:28.386
Oh, yeah. I know what you mean.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.806
Well, good luck.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.143
-I mean it.
-Same here, Ed.

31:37.186 --> 31:38.646
I mean it, too.

31:41.983 --> 31:45.028
I'll see you guys, huh? Take care.

31:50.658 --> 31:52.118
Hungry life, Frank.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.871
I thank my lucky stars I'm getting out.

31:57.165 --> 31:58.666
How about doing us a favor, huh?

31:58.750 --> 32:01.044
Just shipping the kid downtown.
Save me the trip.

32:01.127 --> 32:03.463
How about doing me a favor
and giving me a reason?

32:04.047 --> 32:05.048
No reason.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.967
When Division tells me to roll,
I just roll.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.179
-What's the problem?
-It's nothing personal, Emil.

32:15.892 --> 32:18.853
But I wanna be there
when you interrogate the kid.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.188
Okay?

32:33.701 --> 32:36.913
-(car horn honks)
-(church bells chime)

32:48.758 --> 32:50.551
A year we've been on this, huh?

32:50.635 --> 32:53.137
A full year,
and nobody thought to measure nothing.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.223
How could we screw up like this?

32:55.306 --> 32:57.767
WASHINGTON:
Maybe we could cut off her legs.

32:57.850 --> 33:00.144
-That's criminal, man.
-Uh-huh.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.980
I say we get ourselves
to a hardware store,

33:02.063 --> 33:03.439
do it and get it done, babe.

33:03.523 --> 33:04.983
-Cut off her legs?
-Mm-hmm.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.239
Now level with me, Charlie, please.

33:11.948 --> 33:14.242
How much of it is test scores?

33:15.994 --> 33:17.620
I mean percentage.

33:18.246 --> 33:21.332
Uh, 50-50? 60-40? What?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.921
Don't play games with me, Charlie, please.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.007
Everyone knows
Frank is moving up to Division,

33:29.090 --> 33:30.508
so the captaincy's open.

33:30.591 --> 33:32.468
Hey, look, I'll get back to you later.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.887
Frank, no Schneider.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.055
He'll be there.

33:37.098 --> 33:39.183
Oh, uh, do something for me,
will you, Ray?

33:39.267 --> 33:41.310
Call Dave Rapetto over at Vice

33:41.394 --> 33:44.313
and see if you can get his paperwork
on the Heads and Tails Club.

33:44.397 --> 33:46.357
Employees, clientele, like that.

33:46.941 --> 33:48.651
Ask him if he'll keep it off the records.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.486
Send Hill and Renko
to pick it up in person.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.071
What are we looking for?

33:53.489 --> 33:55.783
I don't know yet. Maybe nothing.

33:56.659 --> 33:59.537
Maybe satisfy myself
Schneider's covering the same bases.

33:59.620 --> 34:03.583
Phil, I would like to request the services
of Officers Hill and Renko.

34:03.666 --> 34:05.668
Oh, your request is granted, Ray.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.962
I'll radio them to be
at your disposal immediately.

34:08.046 --> 34:10.048
You mind telling me what's going on here?

34:10.131 --> 34:13.176
-Protocol, Francis.
-Oh.

34:13.259 --> 34:18.639
Oh, by the by, Francis, uh,
you know Mr. Bromfield, the S.P.C.A. man?

34:18.723 --> 34:21.267
He had a small misfortune
while in traffic.

34:21.350 --> 34:22.435
Traffic?

34:22.518 --> 34:24.812
He's supposed to be in the sewer.
What happened to him?

34:24.896 --> 34:26.689
Oh, he's alive. He's all right.

34:26.773 --> 34:29.358
While stopped at a traffic light,
he somehow accidentally

34:29.442 --> 34:32.320
scratched himself
with a tranquilizer dart.

34:32.403 --> 34:35.656
County Detox has got him.
They say he's sleeping like a baby.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.702
You by any chance
pass this along to Hunter?

34:39.786 --> 34:41.162
Oh, negative, Francis.

34:41.245 --> 34:43.623
It didn't seem quite like
the proper protocol.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.262
-Okay.
-WASHINGTON: All right, babe.

34:58.346 --> 35:02.892
Here it comes. Here it comes.
Easy. Easy. Boy, this sucker's heavy.

35:02.975 --> 35:04.769
-I got it.
-Yeah.

35:04.852 --> 35:06.312
-Okay, here it goes.
-Okay.

35:06.979 --> 35:07.980
Grab it.

35:11.692 --> 35:12.819
Ahh.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.783
-Here's the bag, man. Grab it.
-Okay.

35:18.866 --> 35:20.535
-You got it? You got it?
-Yeah.

35:22.161 --> 35:25.039
(coughing)

35:25.123 --> 35:27.834
Oh, man. (sighs)

35:27.917 --> 35:31.671
-Okay, let's do it.
-Hey, man, it's dark enough. Why bother?

35:31.754 --> 35:34.090
Hey, man, we paid the dude
for a four-legged alligator.

35:34.173 --> 35:36.384
-You want your money's worth or what?
-(jeering)

35:36.467 --> 35:38.928
All right, lover. Let's tape them back on.

35:39.011 --> 35:41.347
MAN: Say, brother.
Say, you, down there in the hole!

35:41.430 --> 35:44.183
<i>Drama of the Jungle. </i>You. Yeah. What's up?

35:44.267 --> 35:46.269
Police business. Vacate the scene, please.

35:46.352 --> 35:47.937
(jeering continues)

35:48.020 --> 35:51.774
Hey, I said it was police business,
so move it out of there. Move.

35:51.858 --> 35:55.278
-(laughing)
-MAN: All right. All right.

35:55.361 --> 35:59.407
-"Vacate the scene, please." (laughing)
-These people, I swear.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.242
-Give me some tape.
-Yeah, here.

36:02.827 --> 36:06.789
I wouldn't call my mood demoralized,
Frank, but, uh, let's be candid.

36:06.873 --> 36:09.625
It does tax one's proclivity to cope.

36:09.709 --> 36:13.588
Oh, yeah, Howard.
It can renew one's lack of faith.

36:17.133 --> 36:20.970
Which brings one, parenthetically,
to the heart of the matter, Frank.

36:21.053 --> 36:22.180
You're up for commander.

36:22.263 --> 36:24.557
MAN (over radio)<i>: Base camp,</i>
<i>come in. This is Munson.</i>

36:24.640 --> 36:25.850
<i>-Urgent.</i>
-Uh, wait a minute.

36:25.933 --> 36:29.270
<i>Base camp. Come in, Lieutenant.</i>
<i>This is Munson. Urgent.</i>

36:29.353 --> 36:32.190
-This is Hunter.
<i>-Sighted alligator, moving fast.</i>

36:32.273 --> 36:34.942
-Designate position. Over.
<i>-Corridor "L."</i>

36:39.947 --> 36:41.449
-(gunfire)
-(screams)

36:41.532 --> 36:43.701
(laughing)

36:43.784 --> 36:45.870
(gunfire continues)

36:52.126 --> 36:54.587
(sniggering)

36:58.424 --> 37:00.009
WOMAN: Oh-ho.

37:06.140 --> 37:09.602
(indistinct chatter)

37:09.685 --> 37:12.813
This is just one more example
of the rampant unprofessionalism

37:12.897 --> 37:14.982
that is legend in this precinct.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.484
Frank, Judas!

37:16.567 --> 37:18.736
My boys shouldn't have to
put up with this.

37:18.819 --> 37:20.905
Not with a gaggle of prankster apes

37:20.988 --> 37:24.617
who have Silly Putty for brains
and jelly where their manhood oughta be.

37:24.700 --> 37:28.704
Howard, the whole thing is unfortunate,
and it will be investigated.

37:28.788 --> 37:29.830
I assure you.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.541
If you're here that long.

37:33.167 --> 37:34.502
I'll be around.

37:35.253 --> 37:38.714
Ed Chapel's up against me,
and in my opinion,

37:38.798 --> 37:41.676
if anybody's interested,
he's much better suited for the job.

37:42.843 --> 37:44.345
Excuse me, Frank.

37:45.346 --> 37:46.889
Uh… (coughs)

37:46.973 --> 37:51.102
Lieutenant Schneider's here,
and so's Rodriguez's public defender.

37:51.185 --> 37:52.270
Hello, Howard.

37:55.147 --> 37:57.483
Should go nicely with the moose heads.

38:00.778 --> 38:04.073
Thank you, Henry.
Tell them I'll be with them in a minute.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.752
Let's put our bacon on the table, Frank.

38:18.170 --> 38:20.214
When it comes to discipline, you're…

38:20.298 --> 38:23.301
Oh, let's face it.
You-- You're just too damned elastic.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.052
Too damn forgiving.

38:25.136 --> 38:29.223
Your focus is ideas,
strategies, uh, command decisions.

38:29.765 --> 38:33.144
Division needs you.
And this place needs an iron hand.

38:33.227 --> 38:35.604
-Look, Howard--
-No, listen, I know you're gonna tell me

38:35.688 --> 38:38.816
that this conversation is premature,
but I don't think so. No, I don't.

38:39.567 --> 38:43.487
Not that I'm saying I'm above
being occasionally premature.

38:48.159 --> 38:48.993
(chuckles)

38:53.664 --> 38:56.459
-(grunting)
-Renko, hey, would you just listen to me?

38:56.542 --> 38:59.337
Just kick a little bit lower,
and don't worry about so much force.

38:59.420 --> 39:02.298
-Just use some finesse, man.
-Don't talk to me about finesse.

39:02.381 --> 39:03.758
I am finesse.

39:05.551 --> 39:06.677
(grunts)

39:07.428 --> 39:09.388
It's basic career growth,
the way I look at it.

39:09.472 --> 39:13.768
Now, you… you may
make sergeant someday in the future.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.437
Appreciate your confidence in me, Renko.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.981
Uh, me, I will pass my exams,

39:19.065 --> 39:20.524
become a plainclothesman,

39:20.608 --> 39:22.485
get into Homicide,
become a Homicide unit--

39:22.568 --> 39:25.112
Homicide will only take,
uh, college graduates.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.615
Well, that's why I'm going
back to college next semester.

39:27.698 --> 39:28.741
All right.

39:28.824 --> 39:30.743
Every man has a destiny,
the way I look at it.

39:30.826 --> 39:31.660
Mm-hmm.

39:31.744 --> 39:35.456
Some just go rising up
that big ladder of success.

39:35.539 --> 39:38.292
Maybe some people slide off
to the side like this--

39:38.376 --> 39:42.129
-Or maybe some don't.
-Right.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.631
You take Furillo, for instance.

39:43.714 --> 39:45.966
Now, from what I hear,
he's gonna be made captain.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.387
Which means one of those lieutenants,
Mulenburg or Hunter or "Calletaino"--

39:49.470 --> 39:51.806
-"Calletano."
-Calletano, however you pronounce it.

39:51.889 --> 39:54.100
One of those guys is gonna be
put into Frank's slot.

39:54.183 --> 39:57.603
-Mm-hmm.
-My point is, everything changes.

39:57.686 --> 39:59.563
Nothing remains the same.

39:59.647 --> 40:02.024
Except for those people
who wish to just look

40:02.108 --> 40:03.818
from paycheck to paycheck to paycheck.

40:03.901 --> 40:06.445
-Meaning me, I suppose?
-No, no. I didn't mention any names.

40:06.529 --> 40:09.490
-Well, that's what you were implying.
-I did not mention a name.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.826
You didn't say my name.
But you implied it though.

40:11.909 --> 40:13.994
I implied nothing.
What I'm trying to say is--

40:14.078 --> 40:17.832
-What are you trying to say? What?
-(Renko, indistinct)

40:17.915 --> 40:19.250
(meows)

40:28.509 --> 40:31.137
Why'd you need a screwdriver
at 4:00 in the morning?

40:31.220 --> 40:33.639
He was repairing the antenna
on his television set.

40:33.722 --> 40:35.433
(scoffs): He's already answered that.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.726
Building superintendent says
that basement door's

40:37.810 --> 40:39.520
kept locked to keep the junkies out.

40:39.603 --> 40:42.273
It was locked when we investigated
the premises this morning.

40:42.356 --> 40:45.818
I haven't had a good chance
to really study the arrest report,

40:45.901 --> 40:49.572
so I think it would be
in our best interest not to answer

40:49.655 --> 40:51.198
any further questions at this time.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.117
I didn't do anything to her.

40:53.742 --> 40:55.828
I didn't see her or nothing, man. I just…

40:56.620 --> 40:58.497
I came upstairs, and-- and…

40:59.457 --> 41:01.792
and she was lying there.

41:03.085 --> 41:05.629
Must've been quite a shock
coming on her like that.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.133
You and her

41:09.967 --> 41:11.719
maybe spent time together?

41:14.138 --> 41:18.225
I know how it is, kid.
It's… It's rough, tears you apart.

41:19.435 --> 41:22.813
Things go spinning around
inside your head at a time like that.

41:24.482 --> 41:28.944
Maybe you took a piece of jewelry off her
that you'd given her some time before.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.362
For memory's sake.

41:31.113 --> 41:33.741
-Is that possible?
-No, I did not do anything like that!

41:33.824 --> 41:36.243
I think we'd better
cut this off right now.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.703
Lieutenant. Captain.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.415
Absolutely.

41:42.625 --> 41:45.002
FURILLO: I wonder if we could
shed some light

41:45.085 --> 41:47.880
on the victim
without compromising your client.

41:49.089 --> 41:50.299
You don't have to answer.

41:54.637 --> 41:58.974
She worked at the Heads and Tails Club
a little over a year ago.

42:00.267 --> 42:03.771
We know that, Nemo.
We also know she was 14 then.

42:03.854 --> 42:07.149
Somebody must've liked her--
recruited her off the Hill.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.319
Who was that, Nemo?

42:10.402 --> 42:14.448
Do you think that's okay, Nemo?
Fourteen-year-old girls?

42:14.532 --> 42:15.866
Man, she didn't ask me.

42:15.950 --> 42:18.285
She didn't tell me nothing.
She just went, all right?

42:18.369 --> 42:21.872
-Her aunt couldn't stop her?
-Her? Man, she don't care.

42:23.541 --> 42:24.917
She came back.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.545
Why do you suppose she came back, Nemo?

42:27.628 --> 42:29.672
To see you or to see her aunt?

42:35.511 --> 42:36.554
Okay.

42:39.932 --> 42:42.601
The deputies will be
taking you downtown soon.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.522
Use the room here,
why don't you, Counselor.

42:46.605 --> 42:47.856
Thank you, Captain.

42:59.076 --> 43:01.996
Word of friendly advice, Frank.
Drive in your own lane, huh?

43:02.079 --> 43:04.456
You'll get where you're going
a hell of a lot faster.

43:05.374 --> 43:06.458
Maybe so.

43:07.251 --> 43:09.003
Come on, Frank.

43:09.086 --> 43:11.380
We've known each other for 15 years.

43:11.463 --> 43:14.258
You don't need that stuff
to make the jump.

43:14.341 --> 43:17.511
Homicide's my problem.
Heads and Tails belongs to Vice.

43:18.345 --> 43:21.015
Let's not go stepping over
each other just for nothing.

43:21.724 --> 43:24.143
-You think he's your boy?
-Yeah.

43:25.019 --> 43:29.023
I wouldn't lick the stamp
till forensics came in, but, yeah.

43:31.900 --> 43:34.403
I think your public is awaiting you.

43:34.486 --> 43:36.030
Take care of yourself, huh?

43:36.780 --> 43:38.115
How are you, Rabbi?

43:50.794 --> 43:53.380
Yeah. Well, there's always
the possibility.

43:53.464 --> 43:54.798
It could go either way, Mick.

43:54.882 --> 43:58.802
Well, my guess is
no one's half as good as you are, Captain,

43:58.886 --> 44:02.473
so congratulations and best of luck.

44:02.556 --> 44:04.933
I think it's great. Sensational.

44:05.017 --> 44:06.143
Thank you, Mick.

44:07.519 --> 44:11.815
Um, every man's got
his own destiny, Captain,

44:11.899 --> 44:14.485
and you shouldn't worry
about what gets left behind.

44:14.568 --> 44:17.071
I mean, what happens
to us people up on the Hill.

44:17.154 --> 44:18.781
You just gotta erase that.

44:20.491 --> 44:22.785
It's like ships that passed in the night

44:22.868 --> 44:25.663
and sailed away alone across lonely seas.

44:25.746 --> 44:29.041
-You know.
-Uh--

44:29.124 --> 44:30.542
Eh-- Uh-- Wait.

44:30.626 --> 44:32.461
-(growling)
-Wait. No, no. Hold it, Mick.

44:32.544 --> 44:35.214
It's okay. All right. Just a second. Oh!

44:38.967 --> 44:42.262
It's already had a rough day.
I appreciate the good wishes, Mick.

44:42.346 --> 44:45.224
I just wanted you to know
that you shouldn't worry about us.

44:46.141 --> 44:47.726
We're gonna do just fine.

44:49.561 --> 44:50.813
(sighs)

44:57.319 --> 44:59.988
Yes, Francis, I think you owe
the men a formal announcement

45:00.072 --> 45:01.240
of the possibilities,

45:01.323 --> 45:05.577
morale-wise, candor-wise, and otherwise.

45:06.036 --> 45:08.497
You're right, Phil. I'll do that.

45:08.580 --> 45:10.082
I called Forensics.

45:10.165 --> 45:13.961
Uh, the Rodriguez kid's prints
are all over the murder weapon.

45:16.380 --> 45:19.425
Well, as Schneider says,
I guess that licks the stamp.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.014
-Oh, Phil, uh…
-Mm-hmm.

45:26.098 --> 45:27.725
…could you do something about this?

45:27.808 --> 45:30.811
-(chuckling): I think so.
-(cat meows)

45:30.894 --> 45:31.895
Uh…

45:33.731 --> 45:34.773
And…

45:37.067 --> 45:40.154
could you ask Henry
to please do something about that?

45:40.237 --> 45:42.114
-All right. All right.
-Thanks, Phil.

45:42.197 --> 45:43.699
-Good night.
-Good night.

45:44.491 --> 45:47.077
(thunder rumbling)

45:59.757 --> 46:01.675
Division's such a political snake pit.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.594
I don't know if I'm equipped for that.

46:04.386 --> 46:05.929
You're equipped for it.

46:07.890 --> 46:09.349
It would mean more bucks.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.602
Many more bucks.

46:12.478 --> 46:15.731
And more time for
the better things in life, namely, <i>moi</i>.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.069
Hmm.

46:21.153 --> 46:22.488
You want to sell me a little?

46:23.197 --> 46:24.740
Homework, Furillo.

46:26.408 --> 46:29.912
Do I detect political action
in this bedroom, Counselor?

46:29.995 --> 46:33.123
You detect no action in this bedroom.

46:33.207 --> 46:36.835
But since you brought it up,
you may as well know my opinion,

46:37.878 --> 46:41.840
which is that politics is everywhere,
and you may as well get good at it.

46:41.924 --> 46:44.259
Not that you're not, because you are.

46:45.052 --> 46:49.181
As I recall,
you politicked me into the sack

46:49.264 --> 46:50.891
the first day you met me.

46:50.974 --> 46:52.643
(laughing)

46:52.726 --> 46:55.687
How'd you do that anyway?
You drug me, Furillo?

46:55.771 --> 46:59.691
-Mmm.
-(pager beeping)

46:59.775 --> 47:01.193
(sighs)

47:01.276 --> 47:04.571
Nothing is moving me out
of this bedroom tonight, Counselor.

47:04.655 --> 47:07.074
So, just put those books away.
I'll be right back.

47:09.284 --> 47:10.911
(sighs)

47:13.205 --> 47:16.583
-When is this gonna stop?
-Midtown is handling it, Fay.

47:16.667 --> 47:19.545
They know what they're doing,
and I want you to cooperate with them.

47:21.463 --> 47:24.341
If you heard the things
he threatened on the phone…

47:26.051 --> 47:27.177
Very graphic.

47:29.805 --> 47:32.391
He's making me physically ill, Frank.

47:33.308 --> 47:34.393
You know what he said?

47:35.227 --> 47:37.437
He said that he's smarter than the police.

47:37.521 --> 47:39.189
He's not. We'll get him.

47:39.273 --> 47:41.441
-Guaranteed?
-Guaranteed.

47:42.609 --> 47:43.610
(sighs)

47:43.694 --> 47:45.904
How long can Frank Jr.
stay with your mother?

47:45.988 --> 47:47.281
Till Monday.

47:48.031 --> 47:51.285
She's going to the hot springs.
I can't ask her to cancel.

47:51.368 --> 47:53.453
I'm not asking you to ask her.

47:56.331 --> 47:57.791
Can I go home with you tonight?

47:58.917 --> 48:02.629
Please, Frank? I can't go back there.

48:05.340 --> 48:08.010
You could call her on the phone
and warn her that I'm coming.

48:17.269 --> 48:18.937
Don't worry about it. Let's go.

48:22.065 --> 48:24.484
It's not gonna bother me
if there's somebody there.

48:24.568 --> 48:27.487
It could bother her,
but it's not gonna faze me one bit.

48:29.281 --> 48:32.200
-That's good to know.
-Then there is someone there.

48:32.284 --> 48:34.161
Not that it's any big deal if there is.

48:38.790 --> 48:41.460
(theme music playing)
