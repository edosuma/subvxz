Hey! Nikita!

33:05.871 --> 33:08.139
You can keep your invisible hand.

33:08.206 --> 33:10.308
I've got an iron fist.

Don't you see, Nikita?

33:26.291 --> 33:29.761
- They're capitalists.
- Come back here and help me!

33:29.828 --> 33:31.397
Don't leave!

33:31.463 --> 33:34.733
Their only loyalty is to themselves.

Kill me.

33:42.007 --> 33:44.543
Kill me!

33:44.610 --> 33:46.044
No, I'm not gonna kill you, Nikita.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.980
I won't end up in a communist prison.

33:49.047 --> 33:51.082
Kill me!

you're no better than him.

You're a good communist, Gregor Anghel.

34:04.530 --> 34:05.964
NIKITA: Gregor Anghel, shoot me!

34:06.031 --> 34:09.333
You are the winner,
I'm the loser, shoot me!

34:45.136 --> 34:48.039
We both went to the west

I saw the reality, but
Nikita saw the illusion.

for the American ambassador

to be seen fraternizing
with a Romanian detective.

Hmm. Please.
