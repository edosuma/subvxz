WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:02.460
Hey! Kyle the Cloud 9 Cloud here!

00:02.479 --> 00:05.346
And I'm about to make it rain savings!

00:07.350 --> 00:09.684
15% off all dental products!

00:09.719 --> 00:11.052
You want the tooth?

00:11.087 --> 00:13.421
You can't handle the tooth!

00:13.490 --> 00:15.590
Meatballs with a chance of clouds?

00:15.659 --> 00:17.058
Give me a break!

00:17.093 --> 00:18.059
A dance break!

00:24.233 --> 00:25.433
He killed 14 people

00:25.516 --> 00:27.236
and ate the meat off their bones.

00:27.670 --> 00:30.171
That's what the FBI has
claimed about Daniel Hertzler,

00:30.206 --> 00:32.962
better known to millions
as Kyle the Cloud 9 Cloud.

00:32.963 --> 00:36.110
Damn, when white people go
crazy, they really do it up.

00:36.178 --> 00:39.379
Yeah, we pretty much still have the
market cornered on serial killing.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.548
It's one of the last
non-integrated industries.

00:41.584 --> 00:44.455
Okay, look, this is not
the best in-store viewing.

00:44.471 --> 00:45.704
Amy, could you change it?

00:45.772 --> 00:46.704
Right. Got it.

00:46.774 --> 00:47.706
Um...

00:47.774 --> 00:49.140
Oh. Oh, no, no.

00:49.176 --> 00:50.442
No, that just made it worse.

00:50.476 --> 00:51.876
Yeah, thank you, Jonah.

00:51.945 --> 00:53.845
I'm sorry, Amy,
could you just let me do it?

00:53.881 --> 00:55.614
Do you mind if I try? Thank you.

00:55.649 --> 00:56.781
And purchased at a Cloud 9 store.

00:56.815 --> 00:58.215
Oh, no.

00:58.285 --> 00:59.150
All the victims were sawed into

00:59.185 --> 01:00.818
evenly portioned pieces

01:00.854 --> 01:03.388
with their genitals
preserved in pickling jars.

01:03.456 --> 01:04.388
- That makes sense.
- Oh.

01:04.456 --> 01:05.522
We sell pickle jars?

01:05.558 --> 01:06.990
- No, no.
- It's not working.

01:07.026 --> 01:09.561
We're gonna have to drown this out.

01:09.630 --> 01:11.395
Everybody sing, okay?

01:11.464 --> 01:13.798
♪ Down in the valley
where Ezekiel wept ♪

01:13.833 --> 01:16.067
♪ Cry, Ezekiel, cry ♪

01:16.136 --> 01:17.668
Come on, what's wrong with you?

01:17.703 --> 01:19.570
Garrett, give me a beat or something.

01:19.639 --> 01:20.571
Anything.

01:20.639 --> 01:22.072
Okay.

01:22.142 --> 01:24.008
♪ The finger of the devil

01:24.042 --> 01:26.643

Cry it out!

01:37.155 --> 01:39.489
As most of you may have heard,
our company spokesman

01:39.525 --> 01:42.092
has been accused of some improprieties.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.859
By improprieties, you mean killing

01:43.896 --> 01:45.195
and eating people, right?

01:45.230 --> 01:47.697
Or is there a tax evasion
thing going on as well?

01:47.731 --> 01:48.864
The killing and eating.

01:48.901 --> 01:52.535
I can't speak to his tax situation.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.537
Anyway, does anybody have any questions?

01:54.571 --> 01:57.739
What is the difference between
a zombie and a cannibal?

01:57.775 --> 01:59.675
Oh, okay, a zombie is undead,

01:59.711 --> 02:02.512
and a cannibal's just, like,
a dude who eats people.

02:02.546 --> 02:05.614
So I kind of meant
work-related questions.

02:05.683 --> 02:06.615
But I'm right though?

02:06.684 --> 02:07.582
He is correct.

02:07.618 --> 02:09.116
I have a work-related question.

02:09.187 --> 02:11.688
What security measures are we
taking to avoid revenge crimes?

02:11.722 --> 02:13.054
Revenge crimes?

02:13.089 --> 02:15.557
Families of the victims
trying to eat us as payback.

02:15.593 --> 02:16.959
I mean, that's what I would do.

02:17.027 --> 02:19.560
Okay, let's not rush to judgment.

02:19.596 --> 02:21.730
These are just allegations.

02:21.765 --> 02:23.457
I'm sure he didn't do it.

02:23.458 --> 02:24.457
Wait, Glenn?

02:24.494 --> 02:26.761
Why are you so sure he didn't do it?

02:26.796 --> 02:31.284
Because, Amy, I met Kyle at a
corporate conference last year.

02:31.332 --> 02:33.532
We had a great conversation.

02:33.601 --> 02:35.667
He seemed like a good guy.

02:35.702 --> 02:36.801
Well, that settles it.

02:36.837 --> 02:38.431
I guess there's no reason for a trial.

02:38.432 --> 02:41.831
I am telling you, there
is no way that good man

02:41.867 --> 02:44.801
could have done this horrible thing.

02:44.837 --> 02:45.836
Right, Jeff?

02:48.006 --> 02:49.707
Uh-huh.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.516 --> 03:02.485
You know, this was creepy
even before he murdered people.

03:02.520 --> 03:04.387
This paint smells like wet dog,

03:04.456 --> 03:07.022
and it's gonna take at least
three coats to cover this.

03:07.058 --> 03:08.558
This is the worst day ever.

03:08.627 --> 03:10.526
The worst.

03:10.570 --> 03:14.468
I mean, obviously,
Kyle the Cloud's victims...

03:14.468 --> 03:14.951
Yeah. No, no.

03:14.952 --> 03:18.712
Had a worse day when he ate
their flesh off their bones.

03:18.712 --> 03:20.845
Terrible day. That was a terrible day.

03:20.881 --> 03:21.846
Goes without saying. Yeah.

03:21.882 --> 03:23.814
Yeah.

03:23.849 --> 03:26.884
Although, at least their
suffering is over, you know?

03:26.953 --> 03:28.685
Ours has just begun.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.220
Is it insensitive that I'd rather

03:30.290 --> 03:31.655
be in Kyle the Cloud's basement?

03:31.689 --> 03:32.655
No.

03:32.698 --> 03:34.065
At least you could read down there.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.969
And it would be so dark and cool.

03:35.969 --> 03:37.827
So dark and cool.

03:37.862 --> 03:39.195
That would be so nice.

03:41.198 --> 03:43.165
That's my baby sleeping.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.300
- Oh, cool.
- Aww.

03:44.335 --> 03:45.802
Sleeping.

03:45.837 --> 03:46.803
So cute.

03:46.838 --> 03:49.171
- Sleeping.
- Like a little angel.

03:49.206 --> 03:50.406
Sleeping.

03:50.476 --> 03:53.911
Oh. Oh, my gosh, this
next one's kind of funny.

03:53.979 --> 03:55.846
Sleeping.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.080
Okay, guys, guys, guys,
I need everyone's opinion.

03:58.180 --> 04:01.348
Especially you, Garrett, since your
brand is telling it like it is.

04:01.352 --> 04:02.551
Oh, thank you for noticing.

04:02.586 --> 04:04.653
Did you guys pick up on
any weird tension

04:04.689 --> 04:06.323
between me and Jeff at that meeting?

04:06.358 --> 04:08.658
'Cause I think he might be into me.

04:13.832 --> 04:14.864
Oh, I thought you were joking.

04:14.898 --> 04:15.864
No.

04:15.899 --> 04:16.932
I am so sorry.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Stop bullying, Sandra.

04:19.035 --> 04:21.570
Why do you think he's into you?

04:21.605 --> 04:23.572
Okay, the last time he was here,

04:23.608 --> 04:25.708
he came up to me at the end of the day,

04:25.743 --> 04:28.711
looked me straight in the eyes and said,

04:28.746 --> 04:29.711
"I noticed you."

04:31.248 --> 04:33.882
He said, "I noticed you"?

04:33.917 --> 04:36.085
Ooh, Jeff is slutty.

04:37.753 --> 04:40.955
Okay, it's not what he said,
it's how he said it.

04:41.025 --> 04:41.957
It wasn't like...

04:42.026 --> 04:42.958
"I noticed you."

04:43.027 --> 04:45.861
It was like...

04:45.896 --> 04:47.514
"I noticed you."

04:48.231 --> 04:49.230
No, that wasn't it.

04:49.265 --> 04:51.065
It was more like...

04:51.101 --> 04:52.934
"I noticed you."

04:52.970 --> 04:54.402
Ah, that sounded Scottish.

04:54.437 --> 04:55.804
Police discovered a secret

04:55.873 --> 04:57.906
dungeon where the actor
would videotape himself

04:57.941 --> 05:00.041
dismembering and devouring his victims,

05:00.076 --> 05:01.943
often while in cloud costume.

05:01.978 --> 05:03.310
Oh, God.

05:03.379 --> 05:05.145
I've said it once, I'll say it again:

05:05.215 --> 05:07.248
You are a terrible judge of character.

05:07.283 --> 05:09.884
Also you have a weak chin
and you can't dance.

05:09.919 --> 05:11.319
Additional items found on the property

05:11.388 --> 05:13.087
were a coffin filled with hair

05:13.123 --> 05:15.156
and several small bags of marijuana.

05:15.224 --> 05:17.324
Wait, they found marijuana?

05:17.394 --> 05:19.159
This is incredible!

05:19.227 --> 05:20.159
Oh, no!

05:20.229 --> 05:21.795
Get that weak chin off me!

05:21.830 --> 05:24.263
They found marijuana!

05:24.299 --> 05:27.234
He was high!

05:27.268 --> 05:29.636
I hate him.

05:29.672 --> 05:30.671
So much.

05:31.089 --> 05:32.525
We definitely need smocks

05:32.526 --> 05:34.495
because you make your brushes too juicy.

05:34.496 --> 05:35.262
Hello, Clarice.

05:36.265 --> 05:38.499
Oh, gross, stop.

05:40.136 --> 05:43.304
It's crazy how much Kyle stuff
we have to throw away.

05:43.684 --> 05:46.785
Corporate really put their
money on "not a cannibal."

05:46.821 --> 05:50.489
Oh, God, they used to make us wear
this suit to hand out flyers.

05:51.487 --> 05:52.586
Dare you to put it on.

05:52.628 --> 05:53.794
No. No, thank you.

05:53.994 --> 05:55.126
Oh, okay, fine. No, I get it.

05:55.162 --> 05:56.462
You don't want to put on the cloud suit

05:56.497 --> 05:58.697
because you've already got
a big chicken suit on

05:58.766 --> 06:00.966
'cause you're a big chicken.

06:01.001 --> 06:02.434
Oh, my God.

06:02.470 --> 06:04.770
Is that supposed to pressure
me into putting the suit on?

06:05.872 --> 06:06.871
You're right, you're right.

06:06.940 --> 06:08.773
Doing awesome things is overrated.

06:08.808 --> 06:10.641
Just go back to painting.

06:12.612 --> 06:14.612
Well, grab an umbrella

06:14.647 --> 06:17.482
'cause there's a cloud moving in.

06:17.517 --> 06:18.483
Psssh.

06:18.518 --> 06:19.617
What does that even mean?

06:19.652 --> 06:20.718
Oh, my God! You're doing it.

06:20.787 --> 06:21.986
Okay, sorry. Say your cool line again.

06:22.021 --> 06:23.354
- Say it.
- Well, grab...

06:23.389 --> 06:24.455
no, we're past it.

06:30.797 --> 06:32.062
Isn't that terrible?

06:32.131 --> 06:35.867
Today, of all days, she's
dressed like the killer.

06:35.902 --> 06:37.502
Why would she do that?

06:37.537 --> 06:38.869
Hi.

06:38.904 --> 06:40.404
Oh.

06:40.473 --> 06:41.738
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

06:41.807 --> 06:44.008
I wouldn't let my kids touch that.

06:44.043 --> 06:46.410
It says on your website
that all your rooms

06:46.479 --> 06:47.478
have Animal Planet.

06:47.513 --> 06:48.512
Hey there.

06:48.547 --> 06:50.881
I noticed you were on the phone.

06:50.916 --> 06:52.849
No, it's not life or death,
it's just, you know,

06:52.885 --> 06:54.551
at the end of a hard day,
sometimes you want to come home

06:54.586 --> 06:56.753
and watch some monkeys
swinging around on the trees.

06:56.822 --> 06:58.021
I'm just gonna come back later.

06:58.056 --> 07:00.724
I'm sorry, could you hold
on one second please?

07:00.759 --> 07:02.425
Hey.

07:02.494 --> 07:03.527
There's something I'd like to ask you,

07:03.562 --> 07:05.695
but I feel a little weird about it.

07:05.731 --> 07:06.863
Oh, no. Please, please.

07:06.899 --> 07:09.032
- Yeah?
- Yep, ask away.

07:09.067 --> 07:11.867
Somebody vomited in the ladies room,

07:11.903 --> 07:14.170
multiple stalls.

07:14.205 --> 07:16.539
Would you mind?

07:16.574 --> 07:17.873
Of course.

07:17.909 --> 07:19.875
Great, thank you. Thanks.

07:19.911 --> 07:21.177
I appreciate that.

07:21.212 --> 07:23.179
Hi, yes, while I have you on the phone,

07:23.214 --> 07:25.345
I wanted to ask you why
the curtains were gone

07:25.345 --> 07:27.511
when I got back last night.

07:27.546 --> 07:29.246
I'd prefer to have them.

07:29.281 --> 07:30.881
- Just louder.
- I'm hungry.

07:30.916 --> 07:31.882
What is wrong with her?

07:31.917 --> 07:33.417
I'm hungry.

07:33.452 --> 07:34.718
Amy.

07:34.754 --> 07:37.287
What are you wearing that for?

07:37.356 --> 07:38.288
Be... Jonah...

07:38.357 --> 07:39.523
Ah, buh, buh, buh, buh.

07:40.959 --> 07:43.527
I'm dressed in this costume
to show my support

07:43.562 --> 07:45.262
for the cannibal lifestyle.

07:46.531 --> 07:47.563
Oh.

07:47.599 --> 07:49.432
Oh, well, as it turns out,

07:49.467 --> 07:51.567
Kyle was not a cannibal.

07:51.603 --> 07:53.736
He was only killing and eating people

07:53.772 --> 07:56.439
because he was high on marijuana.

07:58.944 --> 07:59.857
What?

07:59.982 --> 08:04.400
It's just that I don't think that
marijuana turns people into murderers.

08:04.401 --> 08:08.736
Otherwise we'd literally
be surrounded by killers.

08:08.772 --> 08:12.407
You don't think people in
this store do marijuana, do you?

08:13.777 --> 08:14.809
I mean...

08:14.878 --> 08:16.811
Uh, probably.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.046
Well, how... how many of them?

08:19.081 --> 08:20.414
Like...

08:22.419 --> 08:23.418
Half.

08:23.452 --> 08:24.785
Half?

08:24.821 --> 08:27.622
Wait, half do, or half don't?

08:28.991 --> 08:30.557
It's both.

08:30.592 --> 08:31.825
Both?

08:31.894 --> 08:34.928
Okay, so, tummy time
is literally just a baby

08:34.964 --> 08:36.731
spending time on its tummy.

08:36.765 --> 08:37.799
Hmm.

08:37.832 --> 08:40.600
Wait, she's gonna turn her head...

08:40.636 --> 08:42.437
now.

08:42.472 --> 08:44.605
Nope, now.

08:44.641 --> 08:46.441
Nope, now.

08:46.476 --> 08:47.442
Nope.

08:47.477 --> 08:51.011
Oh, sorry, guys, bad timing.

08:51.080 --> 08:54.949
Hi, Bo, I was just showing them
the tummy time video.

08:54.984 --> 08:58.452
No, not that one, the good one.

08:58.486 --> 08:59.734
This has got to stop.

08:59.734 --> 09:00.753
Thank you.

09:00.788 --> 09:02.788
She is breaking an
unspoken social contract.

09:02.825 --> 09:04.791
You show one photo.

09:04.827 --> 09:06.093
One.

09:06.128 --> 09:08.528
And we all say it's the
cutest baby we ever seen

09:08.597 --> 09:10.664
even if it's creepy, which it is,

09:10.699 --> 09:12.365
because it's a shrunken-down human,

09:12.434 --> 09:13.967
and then we all move on with our lives.

09:14.001 --> 09:15.968
I mean, I have a ton
of photos of my dogs,

09:16.004 --> 09:18.638
but no one wants to see those.

09:18.674 --> 09:20.373
Right?

09:20.441 --> 09:21.373
Right.

09:21.442 --> 09:22.394
Yeah.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.198
Not even the one where
they're dressed as Ewoks.

09:26.929 --> 09:28.429
All right, you know I got to see that.

09:28.430 --> 09:29.595
Okay, come on now.

09:29.664 --> 09:31.398
Oh, no.

09:31.433 --> 09:32.399
Yeah.

09:32.434 --> 09:33.833
Little Ewok dog.

09:33.868 --> 09:35.035
You stealing a speeder?

09:35.070 --> 09:36.903
You can't drive a speeder, Ewok dog.

09:38.706 --> 09:40.039
Hey, Cody.

09:40.074 --> 09:41.040
Hey.

09:41.075 --> 09:43.576
Hey. Just ignore me.

09:53.688 --> 09:56.888
Just wanted to tell you I value you.

09:58.759 --> 09:59.758
Thank you.

09:59.793 --> 10:01.693
I appreciate that.

10:01.728 --> 10:03.862
I'm going to go over there, okay?

10:08.635 --> 10:10.769
If you're smelling the workers,
you gotta smell Elias.

10:10.804 --> 10:13.237
On Thursdays he smells like ham.

10:13.273 --> 10:15.073
It's hilarious.

10:15.108 --> 10:17.742
Dina, do you think that
marijuana could've had anything

10:17.778 --> 10:19.243
to do with what Kyle did?

10:19.279 --> 10:20.579
That's just about the stupidest thing

10:20.614 --> 10:21.580
you've ever said.

10:21.615 --> 10:23.247
Fine.

10:23.283 --> 10:25.083
I'm just wondering if I have to start

10:25.118 --> 10:27.652
drug testing the employees.

10:27.721 --> 10:30.121
But you always say that
you don't want to do that.

10:30.156 --> 10:35.093
I know, but if the alternative is
someone in this store getting eaten.

10:35.128 --> 10:37.728
Oh, wow. Ooh.

10:37.763 --> 10:40.998
Well, to be safe, I mean,
I could do a surprise

10:41.067 --> 10:43.568
comprehensive drug test,
but that's your call.

10:43.603 --> 10:44.635
I mean, I could go either way.

10:44.670 --> 10:46.470
Do it, don't do it.

10:46.505 --> 10:50.641
I mean, if I had to decide, I
guess I'm leaning towards do it.

10:52.979 --> 10:54.745
Yes. Okay.

10:54.780 --> 10:55.779
Go for it.

10:55.815 --> 10:56.780
It's up to you.

11:05.324 --> 11:07.690
I'm coming for you, Tommy Chong.

11:07.759 --> 11:08.858
I'm coming for you.

11:14.712 --> 11:16.712
How much longer do I have?

11:16.713 --> 11:17.846
Three minutes.

11:17.881 --> 11:20.949
You can just give up.

11:20.984 --> 11:22.116
Nope!

11:22.152 --> 11:25.320
I take not being a
chicken very seriously.

11:27.890 --> 11:30.658
I'm doing a dare.

11:30.693 --> 11:32.560
I'm winning.

11:32.628 --> 11:35.329
The test will detect any
drugs in your system.

11:35.365 --> 11:38.833
We're talking marijuana, cocaine,
heroin, methamphetamines.

11:38.868 --> 11:40.334
What about power pellets?

11:40.335 --> 11:42.335
Ah...

11:42.905 --> 11:44.338
I don't see that. What are they?

11:44.373 --> 11:45.906
Oh, you just take some big boppers,

11:45.975 --> 11:48.075
you cut in some fetty wap,
you put a little disco shake

11:48.143 --> 11:51.478
on there, and then you roll that
up in some Doc McStuffins.

11:51.513 --> 11:52.913
Smoke it.

11:52.982 --> 11:54.647
Get real high.

11:54.683 --> 11:57.150
All right, we're gonna be
testing for everything, okay?

11:57.186 --> 12:00.052
Excuse me, I just remembered
I have to leave early.

12:00.088 --> 12:03.523
- I have a thing at the place.
- What place?

12:03.558 --> 12:05.925
That place. You know, the one
we talked about earlier.

12:05.994 --> 12:07.030
You talked to me about it?

12:07.031 --> 12:12.443
Yeah, I filled out an application and
Brett saw it, he said it's cool, so...

12:12.477 --> 12:13.805
You spoke to Brett about it?

12:13.806 --> 12:16.913
Okay, nobody is leaving until I get
three ounces of yellow, all right?

12:18.781 --> 12:22.949
Okay, look, everyone, Dina has
my full support on this.

12:22.986 --> 12:25.386
Okay, this is for your protection.

12:25.420 --> 12:26.987
Look, people, if you
haven't done any drugs

12:27.055 --> 12:29.790
in the last 72 hours, you
have nothing to worry about.

12:29.825 --> 12:32.458
What about way too much wine?

12:32.495 --> 12:34.461
I'm so bad.

12:34.496 --> 12:35.828
Justine, you're not an alcoholic.

12:35.898 --> 12:37.264
Stop bragging.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.267
Attention Cloud 9 shoppers:

12:41.304 --> 12:42.736
We hope you're having a lovely day.

- Hey, Mateo.
- Hey.

13:27.347 --> 13:29.447
- Hi.
- Umm...

13:29.483 --> 13:31.317
Do you think I could have your number?

13:31.351 --> 13:32.317
My number?

13:33.354 --> 13:36.187
Sure, you can have my number.

13:36.188 --> 13:38.488
- It's 314...
- Mm-hmm.

13:38.524 --> 13:39.989
- 982.
- Got it.

13:40.025 --> 13:46.729
Employee number 314982 is getting a
letter of commendation in his file.

13:46.765 --> 13:49.399
Oh.

13:49.435 --> 13:50.767
For cleaning up the vomit.

13:50.835 --> 13:52.402
Yeah.

13:52.438 --> 13:55.204
You are a good vomit mopper.

13:56.775 --> 13:59.075
Damn.

13:59.110 --> 14:01.343
It is getting steamy in here.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.619
I'm just saying, usually
one person dares

14:06.688 --> 14:08.221
and then the other person has to do it.

14:08.257 --> 14:09.623
You... you understand that, right?

14:09.691 --> 14:10.923
Yep, I get it.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.525
I just don't want you
to have all the fun.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.794
Oh, listen, if you want to do
this thing alone, by all means.

14:14.862 --> 14:15.795
- Nope.
- I have no problem...

14:15.863 --> 14:16.929
All right, hold on.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.565
Sorry! Sorry!

14:19.602 --> 14:20.701
Move out of the way!

14:20.735 --> 14:22.201
- Hands up!
- Okay, okay!

14:27.202 --> 14:28.635
Hey, guys.

14:28.656 --> 14:29.990
- Hey, Jeff.
- Hi, Jeff.

14:31.378 --> 14:32.578
What are you doing?

14:34.415 --> 14:35.380
Product testing.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.216
Product testing.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.750
Okay.

14:40.590 --> 14:41.556
Bye, Jeff.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.924
- That was awesome.
- Yep. One more time?

14:45.959 --> 14:47.391
- Yeah.
- How do we get back there?

14:47.427 --> 14:50.895
Let's... I don't know. Kinda
shimmy over?

14:50.931 --> 14:51.963
Yes, yes, we're get... we're doing it.

14:51.999 --> 14:53.732
- Is it moving?
- We're getting it.

14:53.767 --> 14:56.300
- Hey, how's it going?
- Great.

14:56.337 --> 14:58.904
We get the results tomorrow and
I'll call everyone who's fired.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.405
Actually, I'll just call
those who aren't fired.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.597
It'll save me some time.

15:01.598 --> 15:04.832
No, I don't want to start firing people.

15:04.901 --> 15:08.402
Okay, look, maybe we
shouldn't be doing this.

15:09.438 --> 15:11.773
Look, I get it. You love these people.

15:11.808 --> 15:13.842
I do too, but we told them there
would be a urine test,

15:13.910 --> 15:16.410
so we have to follow through on
this or they won't respect us.

15:16.445 --> 15:17.577
I... I don't believe that's true.

15:17.613 --> 15:19.179
It is true.

15:19.249 --> 15:21.182
They'll think we're weak
and they'll think we're liars.

15:21.251 --> 15:22.783
Is that who we are?

15:22.818 --> 15:24.318
Huh?

15:24.354 --> 15:25.620
Are we weak liars?

15:25.654 --> 15:28.188
No, we're strong truth tellers.

15:28.257 --> 15:29.856
Heck yeah we are. Pep up.

15:29.925 --> 15:31.425
The lab comes at 5:00.

15:33.496 --> 15:36.263
You know that's human urine, right?

15:36.298 --> 15:37.665
Suit yourself.

15:38.656 --> 15:41.059
When she's hungry, it's like...

15:42.732 --> 15:45.265
But when she's tired, it's like...

15:46.836 --> 15:47.935
And when she's...

15:48.003 --> 15:50.336
Just shut up about the baby!

15:51.406 --> 15:52.738
Oh.

15:52.774 --> 15:54.774
Um, okay.

15:54.842 --> 15:56.008
What?

15:56.044 --> 15:57.876
What, was I talking too
much about the baby?

15:57.913 --> 15:59.012
I can stop.

16:00.614 --> 16:02.348
Oh.

16:02.383 --> 16:03.949
Great. Well, thank you.

16:04.019 --> 16:06.886
I mean, it's not that we don't
want to hear about your baby,

16:06.922 --> 16:09.589
it's just that it's been a lot.

16:09.623 --> 16:10.856
No, I understand.

16:10.892 --> 16:13.593
It's like you with your sneakers.

16:13.627 --> 16:14.693
What you mean?

16:14.728 --> 16:16.294
Oh, you know, how you're always like,

16:16.364 --> 16:18.965
"Oh, yeah, I just ordered
my pair of retro Jordans

16:19.034 --> 16:20.633
that are coming in two days."

16:20.701 --> 16:22.601
"You can only get these kicks in Japan."

16:26.406 --> 16:27.605
Wow.

16:27.641 --> 16:29.741
Really seeing everybody's
true colors today.

16:30.778 --> 16:31.743
Real cool.

16:39.453 --> 16:41.485
Well, I'm taking off.

16:41.554 --> 16:42.887
All right, have a good night.

16:42.922 --> 16:44.622
I gotta stop by the hotel first.

16:44.658 --> 16:48.326
I guess there was some kind
of a rodent/bedbug fire.

16:48.395 --> 16:50.796
So that's...

16:50.831 --> 16:53.966
and after that, though, I was
gonna hit the new Italian place.

16:54.001 --> 16:54.967
Are you busy?

16:55.001 --> 16:56.433
Nope.

16:56.470 --> 16:59.437
Oh, let me guess, you want me to clean
up that dead pigeon in aisle six?

16:59.472 --> 17:01.938
No, I was just wondering
if you wanted to get dinner.

17:03.142 --> 17:05.775
You mean, like, pick it up for you?

17:05.810 --> 17:08.811
No, I mean, like, take you out to dinner

17:08.848 --> 17:10.815
to the Italian place
that I just mentioned.

17:10.849 --> 17:13.617
Have you never been asked
out on a date before?

17:13.652 --> 17:14.984
You're asking me out on a date?

17:15.020 --> 17:15.986
Uh-huh.

17:16.021 --> 17:17.988
I knew it!

17:18.023 --> 17:19.423
Oh, I thought, but then Garrett...

17:20.459 --> 17:22.425
Ha! I knew it.

17:22.460 --> 17:24.094
So is that a yes?

17:24.128 --> 17:26.429
Oh. Um...

17:26.441 --> 17:28.407
I haven't even really
thought about that.

17:28.467 --> 17:31.001
I usually don't date white
guys, but you know what?

17:31.036 --> 17:32.102
Sure, why not?

17:32.137 --> 17:33.469
Great.

17:33.505 --> 17:36.673
Oh, my God, I cannot wait to tell
Garrett that I was right about this.

17:36.708 --> 17:38.142
I'm gonna rub it in his stupid face.

17:38.176 --> 17:40.476
Well, you see, this is where
it gets a little touchy.

17:40.513 --> 17:43.713
Just as a manager, I shouldn't
really be dating any employees,

17:43.782 --> 17:49.019
so we would have to keep this between us
if that's okay.

17:49.053 --> 17:50.385
Yeah.

17:50.455 --> 17:51.454
You're the boss.

17:56.194 --> 17:57.861
I should really get on that dead pigeon.

17:57.895 --> 18:00.864
Yes, I didn't want to ask
'cause I didn't want to ruin the moment.

18:02.566 --> 18:03.865
- Hey, Glenn.
- Mm.

18:03.900 --> 18:04.866
What's going on?

18:04.901 --> 18:07.902
Oh, I'm just having a bad day.

18:07.971 --> 18:09.037
You want to talk about it?

18:09.073 --> 18:11.040
I'm happy to be your blender.

18:11.074 --> 18:12.339
My blender?

18:12.375 --> 18:15.576
Yeah, you know, like,
you give me your thoughts

18:15.646 --> 18:20.549
and your feelings, and I'll mix 'em up
and give you back something real good.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.917
Okay, I'm not sure I made
the right decision

18:22.987 --> 18:25.487
about this whole drug testing thing.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.421
Yeah, it's a bit extreme.

18:27.491 --> 18:32.160
Sort of like a... it's like
a watermelon-sized reaction.

18:32.195 --> 18:33.260
- Watermelon.
- Yeah.

18:33.329 --> 18:36.597
It's just, I was so wrong about Kyle.

18:36.667 --> 18:40.401
It makes me question how much I
really know the people around here.

18:40.435 --> 18:42.169
Sure, you don't know
everything about everyone,

18:42.205 --> 18:43.905
but you know the important stuff.

18:43.940 --> 18:47.608
Like, you know that Garrett
is a can of soup.

18:47.677 --> 18:49.944
You know, he's hard on the outside,

18:50.013 --> 18:53.014
but warm and soft on the inside.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.547
He is a can of soup.

18:54.583 --> 18:55.615
Yeah.

18:55.685 --> 18:59.186
And Cheyenne is...
Cheyenne's a yoga mat.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.888
She's colorful and she's fun,

19:01.924 --> 19:04.725
and... then also
she's, like, a little thick.

19:04.759 --> 19:05.758
Yeah. Ah.

19:05.793 --> 19:06.759
Yeah, yeah.

19:06.795 --> 19:11.699
And... and Jonah is an alarm clock.

19:11.734 --> 19:14.768
He's just, like, so
annoying in the morning.

19:14.802 --> 19:16.202
So annoying.

19:16.237 --> 19:17.469
Yeah, you just kinda wanna...

19:18.773 --> 19:20.773
I'd like to throw him
at the wall some days.

19:20.808 --> 19:21.907
Right?

19:21.944 --> 19:25.212
And you're the golf club. You know?

19:25.247 --> 19:28.615
You're... you're the one that...

19:28.650 --> 19:30.650
you're the one that...

19:31.652 --> 19:34.119
That drives the worker balls

19:34.155 --> 19:37.757
soaring towards their full potential.

19:37.791 --> 19:39.224
- Yes.
- Yeah!

19:39.260 --> 19:40.759
Exactly.

19:40.794 --> 19:42.794
Thank you, Amy.

19:42.830 --> 19:46.164
- You've really got a way with words.
- Thank you.

19:46.233 --> 19:50.168
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go tee off on someone.

19:58.812 --> 20:00.979
Dina, cancel the tests.

20:01.015 --> 20:02.648
The golf club is here.

20:02.682 --> 20:03.914
What are you talking about?

20:03.949 --> 20:06.651
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

20:06.686 --> 20:08.286
- We...
- Whoa, whoa!

20:08.321 --> 20:09.654
Don't...

20:09.690 --> 20:11.156
need...

20:11.191 --> 20:12.291
these...

20:12.326 --> 20:14.025
anymore.

20:16.329 --> 20:18.128
My coffee cup's in there.

20:20.332 --> 20:21.865
Yes, it is.

20:26.973 --> 20:28.606
Okay, Amy.

20:30.010 --> 20:30.975
Hey.

20:31.011 --> 20:31.976
How's it going?

20:32.012 --> 20:33.211
Good to see you. Good afternoon.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.013
It is cold in here, isn't it?

20:35.048 --> 20:36.280
They crank that A/C up.

20:36.316 --> 20:37.648
I need a drink myself.

20:37.684 --> 20:38.649
Hi.

20:38.685 --> 20:39.650
Good afternoon.

20:39.686 --> 20:40.651
Hey.

20:40.687 --> 20:42.019
Be careful what you wish for

20:42.054 --> 20:44.355
'cause you just might a-get it.

20:45.390 --> 20:47.324
Oh, hey, man.

20:47.359 --> 20:48.858
Oh, hey, Adam.

20:48.894 --> 20:51.696
What... how's it... what's...
what's going on, man?

20:51.730 --> 20:53.129
Adam just came to pick me up.

20:53.164 --> 20:54.130
Yeah, me too.

20:54.166 --> 20:55.999
I mean, I'm going as well.

20:56.035 --> 20:57.835
It's the end of the day.

20:57.870 --> 20:59.069
I'm tired myself.

20:59.138 --> 21:00.204
Yeah, I get it.

21:00.239 --> 21:03.043
I was just... just coming
to say good-bye. Um...

21:04.210 --> 21:05.742
I'll catch you on the flip
side, all right, bro?

21:05.811 --> 21:06.743
It's good to see you.

21:06.811 --> 21:07.810
Okay.

21:11.215 --> 21:12.381
So...

21:12.417 --> 21:13.983
what was that about?

21:14.017 --> 21:15.050
Um...

21:15.086 --> 21:16.052
nothing.

21:16.087 --> 21:17.754
He's just weird.

21:17.822 --> 21:19.822
Oh, we should set him up
with your brother.
