00:11.380 --> 00:13.010
'Cause I gotta tell you
I got nothing.

00:13.590 --> 00:14.930

Doing a ransom drop in front of
all these people.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.140
Something feels really off.

00:19.180 --> 00:21.180
It's like I got
a bulls eye on my back.

00:21.220 --> 00:24.020
It's a sure way to keep us from
doing anything rash.

00:24.060 --> 00:26.190
Well I'm not gonna do anything
that's going to jeopardize

00:26.230 --> 00:27.570

Please let my little girl little

Can't we do something?
I should be out there.

00:32.780 --> 00:34.240
This is killing me.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.410
Mr. Patterson, all this man
seems to want is the money,

00:36.450 --> 00:38.950
so we do the drop exactly as he
says -- and then we get your

[Jake] Des. Just keep looking
around, alright? Scarlett could

00:46.080 --> 00:47.920
be trapped in one of these cars
for all we know.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.920
[Des] Roger that.

00:49.960 --> 00:52.050
What? Sorry.
Des, I can't hear you, okay?

00:52.090 --> 00:53.050
A stupid Herc just flew over.

I'm not a jerk am I?

01:10.270 --> 01:14.030
Yeah. Is that anyway to talk
to a kidnapper?

01:14.070 --> 01:17.740
Okay listen. Hello. Alright?
I'm sorry.

01:17.780 --> 01:19.530
You wanna talk more
about my manners

01:19.570 --> 01:21.240

to give you a million bucks?

01:21.290 --> 01:22.200

01:22.240 --> 01:24.660
Scarlet's safe. She's with me.

01:24.700 --> 01:27.250
You gotta prove that to me.
That's how this stuff works.

01:27.290 --> 01:30.000
Show me the girl's okay.
Then you'll get your money.

01:30.040 --> 01:33.800

[Jake] No, no, no, no, no.
There are no cops here. Okay?

01:42.010 --> 01:44.930
This is just you and me. But I'm
telling you, the longer I stand

01:44.980 --> 01:48.190
here in traffic with a briefcase
full of cash, the better chance

01:48.230 --> 01:49.940
this is all gonna go sideways.

We were just working on a case.

05:24.650 --> 05:26.740
It was completely
unrelated to this.

else to add here?

there yesterday.

If you had a fixed address,
why book a motel room?

Seems like a convenient place to
stash a little girl,

So I take it I made
it to round two?

06:45.320 --> 06:47.440
What do we have on our Q and A
today? Is it a list of my

06:47.490 --> 06:50.200
favourite movies?
Books? Bands?

06:50.240 --> 06:52.910
Okay don't get your
jumpsuit in a knot.

06:52.950 --> 06:54.330
What is your favourite band?

06:54.370 --> 06:55.290
Why should I tell you?

06:55.330 --> 06:57.580
Fine. Don't.
You brought it up.

06:57.620 --> 06:58.580
What else you got?

06:58.620 --> 07:01.380
I wanna know...
about your crime.

07:02.330 --> 07:03.630
I wanna know
why you did it.

07:05.630 --> 07:08.470
You mean why I killed the junkie
prostitute? Or why I kidnapped

07:08.510 --> 07:10.550
you and robbed
the ATM warehouse?

07:10.590 --> 07:12.550
Let's go in
reverse chronological.

07:12.590 --> 07:14.970
What can I say? I needed
the money. I was on the run.

07:15.010 --> 07:16.520
It was your uncle
who saw to that.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.140
So it was
purely financial?

07:18.180 --> 07:18.640
Mostly.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.810
But there's always other
reasons for why people

07:21.850 --> 07:23.810
do things. Always.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.650
Alright. What was the other
reason for why you grabbed me?

07:27.690 --> 07:31.490
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! So this
is what this is all about.

07:31.530 --> 07:33.820
Well it's understandable, you'd
like to see the bigger picture

07:33.870 --> 07:36.030
as to why you were the one who
was chosen to be kidnapped.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.830
-Why did you choose me?
-I didn't.

07:37.870 --> 07:40.660
What do you mean, you didn't?
You kidnapped me. Why?

07:40.710 --> 07:41.920
It didn't have anything to do
with you. It was just

07:41.960 --> 07:43.420
to piss off Jake Doyle.

07:43.460 --> 07:45.500
Fine...

07:45.540 --> 07:47.260
Then tell me about
the prostitute you killed.

07:50.590 --> 07:53.590
Nah, I think we can tackle
that another time.

07:54.890 --> 07:56.100
I will say this.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.350
Don't be so sure
that I killed anybody.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.230
See you around.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.860
-Hi.
-Des.

08:10.900 --> 08:12.820
I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't be
here. I know that was a, like,

08:12.860 --> 08:14.530
a total bonding moment between
you and you your possible

08:14.570 --> 08:15.700
murdering father.

08:15.740 --> 08:17.660
Mind your own business.
Why are you here?

08:17.700 --> 08:19.120
I need you.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.000
You need me to run a license
plate or some crap, right?

08:21.040 --> 08:23.330
No, I need you to help me find a
briefcase with a million dollars

08:23.370 --> 08:25.880
in it to pay off a kidnapper,
in the next, like 55 minutes.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.710
What the hell are you guys into?

08:33.930 --> 08:36.510
We lost the ransom money.
Why are we just sitting here?

08:36.550 --> 08:37.970
What did the bank say?
Can you get more?

08:38.010 --> 08:39.680
More? No!

08:39.720 --> 08:42.430
That was every last cent we had.
We maxed out everything.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.150
I don't understand. What about
the business accounts,

08:45.190 --> 08:46.770
the line of credit,
our investments?

08:46.810 --> 08:48.190
Joe, there's a least half a --

08:48.230 --> 08:51.280
There is no more money Carlotta.
That was it. All of it.

08:53.070 --> 08:54.990
Okay. Well, we're doing
everything we can

08:55.030 --> 08:56.490
to recover the ransom.

08:56.530 --> 08:58.700
In the meantime, we should
concentrate our efforts on who

08:58.740 --> 08:59.950
might have taken Scarlett.

08:59.990 --> 09:03.370
-Of course. She's right Joe.
-Okay.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.540
Do you know of anyone who might
have a grudge against you?

09:05.580 --> 09:07.840
-Anyone at all.
-Not that I can think of, no.

09:09.460 --> 09:12.550
Scarlett's biological father --
is he capable of doing this?

09:12.590 --> 09:13.930
If he is, he's doing it from
the great beyond. He's dead.

09:15.470 --> 09:17.890
Scarlett's father passed away
when she was still a baby.

09:17.930 --> 09:21.720
Oil and gas. Tough business.
Any enemies? Rivals?

09:21.770 --> 09:23.770
I don't work
with people like that.

09:23.810 --> 09:25.100
Now this is ridiculous.

09:25.140 --> 09:27.310
We need to do something
and we need to do it now.

09:27.350 --> 09:28.440
[phone ringing]

09:28.480 --> 09:32.440
Excuse me for just a moment.
Yeah.

09:32.480 --> 09:33.740
Rose. Could the
Pattersons identify

09:33.780 --> 09:35.400
our hit and run victim, Rich?

09:35.450 --> 09:37.410
No. They have never seen him
before. Looks like he was just

09:37.450 --> 09:38.660
a hired hand.

09:38.700 --> 09:40.700
Any leads on that van
from the ransom drop?

09:40.740 --> 09:42.290
Well without a plate,
it's gonna take me a while.

09:42.330 --> 09:44.410
There are thousands of vans
registered in the province.

09:44.460 --> 09:45.540
[phone ringing]

09:45.580 --> 09:47.120
Wait. He's calling again.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.500
Hello.

09:49.540 --> 09:52.880
You wanted a picture?
There it is. It should remind

09:52.920 --> 09:54.510
you of what's at stake here.

09:54.550 --> 09:56.880
Yeah, I got it. Look.
We just want to get Scarlett

09:56.930 --> 09:58.050
back safe and sound.

09:58.090 --> 10:00.180
You got a funny way
of showing it, hero.

10:00.930 --> 10:02.180
I know your kind.

10:02.220 --> 10:03.310
Always making mistakes
under pressure.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.480
Buddy what makes you so sure
that you know me?

10:07.520 --> 10:09.610
You prove me right, hot shot.

10:11.230 --> 10:15.490
Rose. I need you to run an IP
address from a photo that was

10:15.530 --> 10:17.360
just emailed to me, okay?

10:17.400 --> 10:19.990
It might help us find where he's
keeping the little girl.

10:20.030 --> 10:22.030
We've got less than an hour to
get this psycho his money.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.330
Yeah, okay, I'm on it.

10:23.370 --> 10:24.540
We're on our way to check out

10:24.580 --> 10:26.410
a motel where Rich might be
hiding Scarlett.

10:26.450 --> 10:28.250
Tell the Pattersons
to hang tight.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.970
[Malachy] Let's hope
Scarlett's safe inside.

10:48.890 --> 10:50.020
Hear that?

10:50.060 --> 10:51.060
It's music...

10:54.150 --> 10:57.070
from a stupid video game.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.410
We got a kid's snack pack,

11:05.290 --> 11:07.460
a juice box, crayons.

11:08.370 --> 11:10.710
Has Des been hanging out here?

11:15.300 --> 11:16.800
She wrote her name on this
colouring book.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.670
Scarlett's been here, Dad.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.510
Good news. If she was frightened
she wouldn't be interested

11:22.550 --> 11:23.890
in playing, or colouring.

11:24.970 --> 11:27.060
[bang]
[kick]

11:27.850 --> 11:29.810
-Jake!
-On it!

11:35.820 --> 11:36.980
Hey!

11:37.030 --> 11:37.900
Arrgh!

11:42.570 --> 11:44.660
It's a black Porsche
you're looking for?

11:44.700 --> 11:48.080
Yeah. I know doing this can get
you kicked off the force --

11:48.120 --> 11:49.540
I mean -- out of the Academy.

11:49.580 --> 11:51.250
No one wants that
on their resume, right?

11:51.290 --> 11:54.330
Des, it's a little girl,
and I know how horrible it feels

11:54.380 --> 11:56.040
to be snatched away.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.710
It was not
an awesome experience.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.710
One of the un-awesomest
I've ever experienced.

11:59.760 --> 12:00.670
Well definitely in the top ten.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.010
Made even worse by the fact that

12:02.050 --> 12:03.090
it was my father
who kidnapped us.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.970
And he maybe, possibly killed
someone too, once upon a time.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.480
But whatever. I'm fine.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.890
Well, in his defence,
he didn't, and still doesn't,

12:12.940 --> 12:13.980
know that you're his kid.

12:14.020 --> 12:15.560
Yeah, a lot of difference
that makes.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.360
Tinny...

12:20.780 --> 12:23.030
I know having a criminal slash
dad can be rough.

12:24.490 --> 12:26.950
It makes you question
everything. I used to think I

12:26.990 --> 12:29.490
was gonna wake up one morning
and suddenly wanna go rob

12:29.540 --> 12:31.450
a bank because stealing
was in my blood.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.790
Yes b'y Des, you're a natural
born killer. We all knows that.

12:34.830 --> 12:36.920
You know what I mean, Tinny. Me?

12:36.960 --> 12:39.460
I couldn't even rip off a bag of
chips, but my dad?

12:40.630 --> 12:43.340
He knows how to
rip off all the chips.

12:43.380 --> 12:44.680
Oh my god.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.640
Look, the point is, is that...

12:47.720 --> 12:50.020
I am who I turned out to be.

12:51.390 --> 12:56.560
I'm me, who's who my dad is not,

12:56.610 --> 13:00.780
or is not was you or I and me...

13:00.820 --> 13:02.820
Okay I got a couple of hits
for the black Porsche.

13:02.860 --> 13:04.650
-Let's go check them out.
-Okay.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.820
But Des, even if we find 'em

13:06.860 --> 13:07.700
there's no guarantee that
the money's still going

13:07.740 --> 13:08.910
to be with the car.

13:08.950 --> 13:10.660
Well it's worth a shot.
At the very least,

13:10.700 --> 13:13.750
we'll track down
the vehicular manslaughterer.

13:13.790 --> 13:17.040
[beeping]

13:36.100 --> 13:37.350
Ooof. Ooh.

13:39.270 --> 13:40.900
You see how you're
playing fast and loose

13:40.940 --> 13:42.480
with this young girl's life?

13:42.530 --> 13:45.150
You tell you're new buddy, Joey,
that he can consider this my

13:45.200 --> 13:46.320
two weeks notice.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.610
[Malachy] Hey!

13:47.660 --> 13:48.950
Two weeks notice. [bang]

14:05.300 --> 14:06.380
No.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.090
No...

14:10.510 --> 14:12.560
Yeah. Dad I think that's him.

14:13.470 --> 14:15.100
Listen, okay, this guy, before

14:15.140 --> 14:17.690
I was knocked unconscious,
he said something about

14:17.730 --> 14:19.310
two weeks notice.

14:19.350 --> 14:20.520
I think he works for you.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.320
Griffin Daniels took our
daughter? My driver?

14:24.360 --> 14:26.570
Is he your kickboxing teacher
too, because the guy kicked

14:26.610 --> 14:27.860
the hell outa me.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.030
He's ex-special forces.

14:29.070 --> 14:31.660
Your driver is ex-special
forces? Why?

14:31.700 --> 14:34.240
I travel to dangerous parts of
the world. I need protection.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.120
Why am I even answering this?

14:36.160 --> 14:38.410
Buddy's driver is a trained
killer. Isn't that awesome?

14:38.460 --> 14:40.250
You might have thought to tell
us before now that you have

14:40.290 --> 14:41.540
a mercenary on your payroll.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.380
Listen, he could have some
grudge against you.

14:43.420 --> 14:45.630
Can you think of any reason why
he'd want to exact revenge?

14:45.670 --> 14:46.920
No!

14:46.970 --> 14:48.510
Griffin, he's always been so
sweet to Scarlett.

14:48.550 --> 14:51.760
He wouldn't hurt her. He won't.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.890
Carlotta, what makes you so sure
he won't hurt her?

14:53.930 --> 14:55.270
He didn't seem the type.
He seemed nice.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.850
I didn't quite get that
impression myself.

14:58.890 --> 15:00.440
I can't believe this.
I just, I can't.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.150
Honey, please don't blame
yourself.

15:02.190 --> 15:02.690
I'm not blaming me.

15:04.270 --> 15:05.980
I mean you were the one who was
supposed to be looking her

15:06.030 --> 15:08.150
and you let this guy
in and take Scarlett?

15:08.190 --> 15:10.950
This guy? You're kick boxing
chauffeur? You hired him, Joe.

15:10.990 --> 15:12.990
-You brought him into our life.
-Okay, here we go.

15:13.030 --> 15:15.160
Well why do you need a bodyguard
anyway. Tell them the truth.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.580
Do you see what
I have to deal with here?

15:16.620 --> 15:18.870
Protection in all those
sleazy strip clubs.

15:18.910 --> 15:20.250
That's the real reason.

15:20.290 --> 15:24.340
B'ys. We have thirty minutes
to find your daughter.

15:24.380 --> 15:27.460
So a lot less domestic spatting
would be really good.

15:27.510 --> 15:31.010
The address on Griffin's
driver's license is a fake.

15:31.050 --> 15:32.720
None of my databases
had him listed.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.010
Special forces training.

15:34.050 --> 15:35.140
He knows how to keep
himself off the grid.

15:35.180 --> 15:36.470
Yeah, he was released

15:36.510 --> 15:37.970
from the military with
a dishonourable discharge.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.810
He punched a superior
officer in the face.

15:40.850 --> 15:42.350
So obviously he loves authority.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.610
That's all I could find.

15:43.650 --> 15:45.190
But if we had a cop
with some high clearance,

15:45.230 --> 15:46.480
I think we could --

15:46.530 --> 15:47.860
[phone ringing]

15:47.900 --> 15:49.900
It's him. Just be quiet.
Speaker.

15:51.490 --> 15:52.360
Hello?

15:54.320 --> 15:56.620
Griffin?
Where's my daughter?

15:56.660 --> 15:58.240
[girl on phone] Hello, Daddy?

15:58.290 --> 16:00.750
Oh my god. Honey, Scarlett? Are
you okay baby? Say something.

16:00.790 --> 16:04.420
Scarlett, Scarlett. Do you know
where you are? Where are you?

16:04.460 --> 16:05.500
Tell is where you are.

16:05.540 --> 16:07.040
[Griffin] Nice try, Joey.

16:07.090 --> 16:09.920
Listen to me. I swear, on your
life, I am going to go to

16:09.960 --> 16:12.430
the police if you don't bring
back my little girl.

16:12.470 --> 16:14.050
That's a stellar idea, sir.

16:14.090 --> 16:17.260
No, no, no, no, no. Listen to
me. We just want to make sure

16:17.310 --> 16:19.520
the little girl is safe
and sound, alright?

16:19.560 --> 16:23.900
Doyle. I'm sorry our little spat
got cut short. I promise I'll

16:23.940 --> 16:24.650
finish it properly next time.

16:26.270 --> 16:29.320
And what, I guess I'll be seeing
you guys in about 30 minutes.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.820
What do we do now?

16:32.860 --> 16:34.450
We find Griffin.

16:34.490 --> 16:35.820
Or find the money.

16:35.870 --> 16:39.240
Um, guys? I had a look at Joe's
company finances.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.040
He's on the verge of bankruptcy.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.790
That ransom was
everything he had.

16:42.830 --> 16:44.170
Well I suppose we've
got no choice

16:44.210 --> 16:45.630
but to get that money back now.

16:45.670 --> 16:48.250
Rose, you stay with the happy
couple. If the police are

16:48.290 --> 16:50.170
completely off the table,
I think I have another way

16:50.210 --> 16:52.800
to get Griffin's real address.
I'll be in touch.

16:54.470 --> 16:58.470
Okay. So this is like, the last
name on the list. Pat Coombs.

16:58.510 --> 16:59.850
You think this is
our hit and run guy?

16:59.890 --> 17:01.220
I hope so. Whoa!

17:01.270 --> 17:03.940
It looks like the cops
are on the same track as us.

17:06.230 --> 17:08.070
Let's look around before
they get back.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.610
Okay. 88, 89.

17:16.070 --> 17:18.740
Shouldn't numbers be even on one
side, odd on the other?

17:18.780 --> 17:19.620
Yeah. Except if you're
in Australia

17:19.660 --> 17:21.120
where everything is backwards.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.120
Well that cop just looked in
number 90 and found nothing.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.710
Well maybe our hit and run man
isn't at home.

17:24.750 --> 17:27.710
Or... he switched the numbers...

17:30.630 --> 17:31.840
with this one.

17:35.630 --> 17:37.220
There he is! Let's go!

17:51.110 --> 17:53.110
You doing okay there?

17:53.150 --> 17:54.860
I'm great.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.200
Just great.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.410
I don't know why I hired
you guys though.

17:58.450 --> 18:00.830
Incompetence runs pretty rampant
in your business plan.

18:04.450 --> 18:05.910
My granddaughter
was kidnapped once.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.540
Yeah?

18:08.580 --> 18:09.710
And I don't think I was ever

18:09.750 --> 18:11.420
so frightened by anything
in all my life.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.170
But we kept looking.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.420
And we found her.

18:16.470 --> 18:19.140
So... don't lose hope.

18:20.220 --> 18:23.180
I'm trying not to.
It's just ah...

18:24.720 --> 18:26.270
not having the power
to fix this --

18:26.310 --> 18:29.520
it's really doing my head in.

18:30.650 --> 18:32.270
I can't believe Carlotta
let this happen.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.320
Why are you so focused on
blaming your wife?

18:34.360 --> 18:35.820
She uh...

18:37.820 --> 18:40.490
Carlotta's not the woman
that I married.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.330
Or maybe she
always was that woman

18:44.370 --> 18:45.410
and I was just
too blind to see it.

18:45.450 --> 18:46.660
Care to elaborate?

18:48.250 --> 18:49.290
No I don't.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.550
Just find me my daughter.
So all this can be over.

18:56.340 --> 18:57.670
Please.

19:00.010 --> 19:02.550
Looks like the united front
is really starting to crumble.

19:02.590 --> 19:05.970
I think you're right. See if you
can get Carlotta to open up.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.180
I'm going to dig
a little deeper myself.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.900
Joe's not exactly forthcoming.

19:11.020 --> 19:13.110
Understood.
I'll see what I can do.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.650
Walter?

19:16.530 --> 19:18.650
How about a massive favour?

19:23.870 --> 19:24.790
I need your help.

19:25.620 --> 19:27.790
You can't be here Jake.

19:30.710 --> 19:31.420
No one saw me come in here,
I promise.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.000
-What happened to your face?
-Uh, it's nothing. Listen.

19:37.380 --> 19:39.340
There's a missing eight year old
girl. Her name is

19:39.380 --> 19:40.090
Scarlett Patterson, okay?

19:41.630 --> 19:43.720
The guy that's holding her
ransom -- he's gonna kill her

19:43.760 --> 19:45.930
if I talk to the cops.
And seeing how, technically

19:47.310 --> 19:50.270
you know, you're not actually
a cop right now...

19:50.890 --> 19:52.150
I need your help.

19:52.810 --> 19:53.900
What can I do?

19:55.110 --> 19:57.070
The kidnapper's name
is Griffin Daniels.

19:57.820 --> 19:59.400
He's an ex-special

19:59.440 --> 20:01.860
forces fella and I can't access
his file, so I was thinking that

20:01.900 --> 20:04.910
maybe you could get in there,
have a look around and give me

20:04.950 --> 20:07.240
whatever information
you can find.

20:08.490 --> 20:10.200
I'll see what I can do.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.370
As long as you keep away from me
and don't come back here.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.420
I'll try not
to take that personally.

20:19.630 --> 20:22.760
You know how all this looks
right? It doesn't look great.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.350
I mean, the ginseng bottles.

20:26.930 --> 20:29.770
Either you're looking for a
boost of energy or you're trying

20:29.810 --> 20:31.230
to build a makeshift crack pipe.

20:31.270 --> 20:34.150
Look. It's not mine. Okay Jake?

20:35.560 --> 20:37.900
I'm fine. I know what I'm doing.

20:37.940 --> 20:41.360
Okay? I might look the part.
But I'm not on the crack.

20:42.860 --> 20:45.240
That's good to hear.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.740
I'll have to take
your word for it.

20:47.780 --> 20:52.160
Listen, I just wanted to say
that the last time I was here,

20:53.580 --> 20:56.000
I really enjoyed the time we had
together, you know,

20:56.040 --> 20:58.710
being together, together.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.880
Yeah, me too.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.720
And I'd love to be there again.
I mean, not now, obviously

21:03.760 --> 21:06.050
because I gotta find the 8 year
old girl, but any other time

21:06.090 --> 21:08.890
that you could possibly think of
-- I'm here, I mean I'm --

21:17.230 --> 21:18.150
I should go.

21:20.650 --> 21:21.650
This is pretty.

21:22.610 --> 21:23.950
Who gave it to you?

21:23.990 --> 21:25.200
Your crack boyfriend?

21:26.950 --> 21:28.780
You better not have
a new crack boyfriend.

21:29.370 --> 21:30.950
Get outa here.

21:34.750 --> 21:35.710
And just...

21:37.000 --> 21:39.420
and just call me if
you get any info, okay?

21:48.050 --> 21:50.850
Okay Tinny, what are we gonna
do? We gotta stop him and we

21:50.890 --> 21:52.140
gotta get the money.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.600
Des. Stop distracting me.
I know what I'm doing.

21:59.150 --> 22:00.650
[car revs]

22:00.690 --> 22:01.650
[bang]

22:12.040 --> 22:13.580
Des, I need backup!

22:19.000 --> 22:21.800
[thump]
Ah! I got a splinter...

22:22.710 --> 22:24.170
Aaaah!

22:24.210 --> 22:25.550
Sir!

22:27.130 --> 22:28.930
I'm gonna have to ask you to
stop resisting arrest and put

22:28.970 --> 22:30.430
your other hand
behind your back.

22:30.470 --> 22:31.970
[handcuffs click] Des!

22:32.010 --> 22:34.810
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I was just
distracted by the extreme...

22:34.850 --> 22:36.270
hotness of that whole thing.

22:36.310 --> 22:37.850
Get up!

22:37.890 --> 22:39.020
Where's the briefcase?

22:39.060 --> 22:41.110
Arrgh!
This car is a lease.

22:41.150 --> 22:43.150
How am I going to
explain this damage?

22:43.190 --> 22:43.730
The briefcase! Spill!

22:43.780 --> 22:45.360
What briefcase?

22:45.400 --> 22:47.150
The one you know fell in your
car when you were running buddy

22:47.190 --> 22:49.200
down in the street.
This one, right here.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.530
Ahhh.

22:53.120 --> 22:55.120
Right... here.

22:59.870 --> 23:01.460
Who's this now?

23:02.540 --> 23:03.380
Al Kavanagh.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.760
Man, when they say the streets
are getting uglier

23:06.800 --> 23:08.170
and uglier they really mean it,
don't they?

23:08.220 --> 23:11.010
You must bring property value
down wherever you go.

23:12.050 --> 23:14.310
Some charmer, aren't you?

23:14.350 --> 23:17.680
So I sees private dick junior.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.980
Where's the dickhead senior?

23:20.020 --> 23:23.400
Malachy? Or did he get
an actual job?

23:23.440 --> 23:25.730
No, b'y, still running around
town, chasing scrotbags.

23:27.190 --> 23:29.150
But in this case, no need to
chase. Fate has brought

23:29.200 --> 23:30.700
one right to my feet.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.820
Most people hanging out around
here are looking to by Oxy.

23:32.860 --> 23:35.280
Is that your weakness, Jakey
boy? You don't seem the type.

23:35.330 --> 23:37.950
But it takes all kinds,
as they say.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.370
What are you doing here, scrot?

23:39.410 --> 23:42.290
-That's none of your business.
-Al, forgive me

23:42.330 --> 23:44.250
if I simply walk away
and never think of you again.

23:45.630 --> 23:47.960
The feeling is more than mutual,
you little prick.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.800
[cell phone beep. Car starts]

23:54.180 --> 23:55.810
Thank you Leslie.

23:57.310 --> 23:58.350
Hey.

24:00.180 --> 24:01.890
From Walter.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.650
Carlotta, why didn't either of
you tell us about the divorce?

24:04.690 --> 24:05.980
Why does that matter?

24:06.020 --> 24:07.190
Everything matters when
a child's gone missing.

24:08.320 --> 24:11.240
Joseph thinks
I'm having an affair.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.160
But I'm not.

24:13.030 --> 24:15.120
I love him and we have a --

24:17.620 --> 24:22.500
had a long life together and
now it's all crumbling apart.

24:22.540 --> 24:25.000
[ring]

24:25.040 --> 24:27.170
Jake? Did you talk to Leslie?

24:27.210 --> 24:30.050
Yeah. Leslie got me an address,
okay. I'll text it to you.

24:30.090 --> 24:32.930
We got, like 10 minutes,
so meet me there right away.

24:46.190 --> 24:48.110
Took long enough
to get here tubby.

24:48.150 --> 24:50.730
I've asked you not to call me
that. What do you want?

24:50.780 --> 24:52.820
What do I want?
That's how you greet a client?

24:52.860 --> 24:55.620
You're my lawyer. You should be
thrilled to get my call.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.200
-You're lawyer.
-Hmm.

24:57.240 --> 25:00.160
Yeah. See I was only your lawyer
when you were blackmailing Jake,

25:00.200 --> 25:02.410
and that was just a ploy to get
information out of you.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.210
Still means we got attorney
client privilege, doesn't it?

25:06.250 --> 25:07.920
Mister Tubby?

25:10.170 --> 25:13.010
Great. Now.
What I'd like to ask you,

25:13.050 --> 25:16.970
confidential buddy, is why you
think Jake Doyle's niece

25:17.010 --> 25:19.640
is coming to visit me in prison?

25:19.680 --> 25:21.390
-Tinny.
-Uh-huh.

25:21.430 --> 25:22.520
Wait a minute.
Didn't you kidnap her?

25:22.560 --> 25:25.230
I know. Spooky, huh?

25:26.060 --> 25:26.610
So... what?

25:28.190 --> 25:30.980
I'm just saying -- that Jake's
niece is coming to visit me.

25:31.020 --> 25:34.110
I think Jake would like to know
why she's doing that.

25:34.150 --> 25:36.160
Now you are Jake's best friend.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.950
It's in Tinny's best interest,
am I right?

25:38.990 --> 25:41.700
You know, I will find out.

25:41.740 --> 25:44.040
But I'm sure as hell not gonna
do it for you.

25:44.080 --> 25:48.330
See I'm refusing to represent
you on the grounds that you

25:48.380 --> 25:51.250
are a massive, massive

25:51.300 --> 25:52.760
juice arse.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.010
That's a big mistake, Tubby.

25:55.550 --> 25:58.260
You just got on the list of
people I'm gonna attend to.

26:06.980 --> 26:08.850
I was just afraid I was gonna
lose my license.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.940
Yeah, well no worries about that
cuz you can't drive in prison.

26:10.980 --> 26:12.520
You know you killed a guy?

26:12.570 --> 26:14.400
[beeping] You ran him over.
You drove away. You killed him.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.860
Oh my god! Oh my god, I'm sorry.

26:18.910 --> 26:21.240
You can make this right man.
Okay? Okay? A little girl is

26:21.280 --> 26:22.620
gonna die if we
don't get that cash.

26:22.660 --> 26:23.950
I'm serious, like right now.

26:23.990 --> 26:26.710
What? A little girl?
What are you talking about?

26:26.750 --> 26:29.080
Just tell us! Where's the money?

26:31.500 --> 26:32.550
Alright --

26:32.590 --> 26:33.500
What are you doing?

26:33.550 --> 26:34.460
Ah, Tinny?

26:34.510 --> 26:36.050
You sure you don't know?

26:36.090 --> 26:40.550
No, no no! Fine! Fine! There's a
secret compartment in the trunk.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.780
He's not here.
It looks empty.

26:56.820 --> 26:58.660
No games, no colouring books
and no Scarlett.

27:01.910 --> 27:02.620
Look at this.

27:03.660 --> 27:05.290
Looks like he's
had a guest over.

27:06.750 --> 27:07.830
Expensive taste.

27:07.870 --> 27:09.210
Maybe that's why
he needs the money.

27:09.250 --> 27:10.460
Rose tells me
he doesn't make nearly enough

27:10.500 --> 27:11.540
for this kind of hooch.

27:11.580 --> 27:13.590
[ring]

27:13.630 --> 27:14.670
It's him.

27:15.920 --> 27:16.970
Yeah, I mean hello.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.430
[Griffin] You got a few
seconds left.

27:19.470 --> 27:20.970
Is it fair to say you've got

27:21.010 --> 27:23.640
my money? Or are you too busy
rooting through my house?

27:25.510 --> 27:29.140
So now, not only does the kid
die, but you die as well.

27:29.180 --> 27:32.100
You do not follow
instructions clear enough.

27:32.150 --> 27:35.070
No, no, do not blame the kid for
this, okay? It's my fault.

27:35.110 --> 27:36.190
It's because I'm stupid.

27:36.230 --> 27:37.730
I'm thick.
We just need some more time.

27:37.780 --> 27:41.450
No. You've had enough time.
And I am sure that right now you

27:41.490 --> 27:43.370
and your father are wishing
you hadn't wasted it.

27:43.410 --> 27:45.790
No, just please -- [click]
do not hang up.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.540
[ring]

27:47.580 --> 27:48.410
Now what?

27:49.660 --> 27:52.000
-We have the money.
-Des found the ransom.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.500
[beeping]

27:59.300 --> 28:01.720
[beeping]

28:03.510 --> 28:06.810
[explosion]

28:12.890 --> 28:15.860
I think it's safe to say -- with
everything that's happening --

28:15.900 --> 28:18.230
the police are now
officially involved.

28:18.280 --> 28:21.400
I'll take all the help we can
get. This Griffin guy --

28:21.450 --> 28:23.320
I'm telling you -- he's too
unpredictable

28:23.360 --> 28:24.570
and he's too dangerous.

28:24.620 --> 28:25.620
How come he
seems to know every time

28:25.660 --> 28:27.080
we're within ten feet of a cop?

28:27.120 --> 28:28.660
It doesn't make any sense.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.540
There's no way he could have
known we were in his apartment.

28:30.580 --> 28:32.500
It's creepy how
he keeps close tabs on us.

28:32.540 --> 28:34.330
I had Des run a sweep on
everything we got.

28:34.370 --> 28:37.630
You know -- the house, the van
-- no bugs, nudding.

28:37.670 --> 28:39.210
So how does he know?

28:39.260 --> 28:41.550
Ask. And you will receive.

28:41.590 --> 28:43.590
-[Rose] Nice going, guys.
-And we got the bad guy.

28:43.630 --> 28:45.010
What's this?

28:45.050 --> 28:47.350
Cadet Doyle here has a collar.
The hit and run scumbag.

28:47.390 --> 28:48.760
She called it in.

28:48.810 --> 28:50.680
The uniform on the scene let her
bring him in herself.

28:51.230 --> 28:51.390
Good work.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.730
I bet this will make
your family proud.

28:54.770 --> 28:56.730
Lucky for you, they're all here.

28:57.980 --> 29:00.030
Okay. We've got the money back.

29:00.070 --> 29:02.860
Let's get a plan going to bring
Scarlett home safe and sound.

29:02.900 --> 29:04.530
Ya. After we've talked.

29:04.570 --> 29:05.700
Why don't you and your dad

29:05.740 --> 29:07.910
make yourselves comfy
in the board room?

29:07.950 --> 29:10.620
What about Joseph and Carlotta?
They've been through a lot.

29:10.660 --> 29:12.040
Fine. You can take them home,

29:12.080 --> 29:14.540
but I may have more questions
for them later. Okay?

29:14.580 --> 29:17.340
[Rose]
C'mon guys. Let's get you home.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.430
So this should be
an interesting tale.

29:27.470 --> 29:28.760
Ah, no.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.720
Hood, watch this case for me.

29:30.760 --> 29:33.230
It's Sergeant. And you should
watch how you talk to a superior

29:33.270 --> 29:34.600
officer, Constable Hayward.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.020
Sorry.

29:36.060 --> 29:39.360
It's your chain of evidence.
It's your responsibility.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.740
Explain. Now. Everything.

29:45.780 --> 29:46.870
-Uh.
-Well, I lied.

29:47.780 --> 29:50.580
I told her we were gonna go...

29:50.620 --> 29:51.870
rare bird watching --

29:51.910 --> 29:54.830
which she is totally into.
Tinny loves... bird?

29:54.870 --> 29:56.420
Des shut up.

29:56.460 --> 29:59.250
Anyhoo -- the bottom line is,
I lied and I was investigating

29:59.290 --> 30:01.300
the missing ransom money and
then buddy showed up and then

30:01.340 --> 30:02.460
the chase happened and Tinny,

30:02.500 --> 30:05.010
she was awesome,
and then I got a splinter.

30:05.050 --> 30:06.970
Actually it was pretty bad.

30:08.470 --> 30:09.300
I can't believe
we're stuck in here.

30:09.350 --> 30:10.890
This is a total waste of time.

30:10.930 --> 30:13.310
I agree. The cops are in and now
we're playing by their rules.

30:15.390 --> 30:16.980
Everything okay?

30:17.020 --> 30:20.900
Well, I just talked to my tech
friend. The emails Griffin sent

30:20.940 --> 30:24.070
originated from a mobile account
and are being sent to an address

30:24.110 --> 30:25.320
at the same account.

30:25.360 --> 30:25.900
Who does it belong to?

30:25.950 --> 30:27.450
Joseph Patterson.

30:27.490 --> 30:30.240
Are you saying that Griffin
and Joe are in this together?

30:30.280 --> 30:33.160
No wonder he always knew where
we were. He had an inside man.

30:33.200 --> 30:35.160
Totally makes sense.
He's flat broke. He's heading

30:35.200 --> 30:37.210
into a divorce.
He could easily stage this

30:37.250 --> 30:38.290
kidnapping with Griffin's help

30:38.330 --> 30:39.790
to keep his money
away from Carlotta.

30:39.830 --> 30:41.000
Where's Joe right now?

30:41.040 --> 30:42.710
He's already left.

30:42.750 --> 30:44.460
Listen, I'm going
to head over to the motel

30:44.500 --> 30:46.510
to see if there's anything there
that could lead us to Griffin.

30:48.130 --> 30:51.180
Yes. Sure. Just make yourselves
at home. Have a little Doyle

30:51.220 --> 30:52.850
pow-wow in the RNC Boardroom.

30:52.890 --> 30:54.020
I gotta fly.

30:54.770 --> 30:55.850
Where's the briefcase?

30:55.890 --> 30:57.140
What are you talking about?

30:57.180 --> 30:58.350
The one my granddaughter
brought in?

30:58.390 --> 30:59.650
Full of cash.

31:01.150 --> 31:02.480
-Hey!
-Come back here Jake!

31:02.520 --> 31:05.530
I'm warning you! Jake, I can
order them to shoot you.

31:06.740 --> 31:08.400
Joseph Patterson just
walked out of here

31:08.450 --> 31:09.820
with a briefcase full of cash.

31:09.860 --> 31:12.620
He's our only way to get
Scarlett back and there's a good

31:12.660 --> 31:13.830
chance he's behind all of this.

31:13.870 --> 31:15.410
The briefcase is on my --

31:17.000 --> 31:18.660
Follow him and get that money.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.420
Joe! Stop!

31:20.460 --> 31:22.540
No this has gone too far.

31:22.580 --> 31:24.170
We've gotta
talk about this.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.510
Talk? That's all you wanna do.

31:28.920 --> 31:30.890
-What are you doing?
-No!

31:42.440 --> 31:44.730
Des, we need you to go through
my phone, okay?

31:44.770 --> 31:46.980
Track all the phone calls from
Griffin -- every photo.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.990
This guy may be Special Ops
but he's not infallible.

31:50.030 --> 31:53.320
Dad, Joe did not get into that
van willingly, okay?

31:53.370 --> 31:55.620
-Griffin dragged him in.
-You think Griffin's gone rogue?

31:55.660 --> 31:57.120
Changed the game plan
without telling Joe?

31:57.160 --> 31:58.290
I dunno --
[ring]

31:58.330 --> 32:00.330
Oh, uh -- What do I do?
What do I do?

32:00.370 --> 32:01.330
Give it to me.

32:04.630 --> 32:06.210
Yeah.

32:06.250 --> 32:08.210
[Joseph] I screwed up. He's got
me and Scarlett and the money.

32:08.250 --> 32:10.260
I don't know where we are but
maybe you can trace this or --

32:10.300 --> 32:12.630
Joseph. Just look around. Okay.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.430
See if you recognize
anything around you.

32:14.470 --> 32:17.100
He's got me tied up. I can't
see outside. Let me try --

32:18.180 --> 32:19.980
[Griffin] What are you doing Joey?

32:20.020 --> 32:21.520
[Joseph] Oomph.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.560
[Griffin] Nice try Doyle.
We'll talk later. [cuts off]

32:23.600 --> 32:26.730
-Wa --
-I thought we had 'em.

32:27.270 --> 32:28.110
Maybe we do.

32:29.320 --> 32:30.490
Did you here what was
in the background?

32:30.530 --> 32:31.240
The plane?

32:31.280 --> 32:32.820
You don't think?

32:32.860 --> 32:35.950
Hercs. Griffin's holding Joey at
the exact same spot that we did

32:35.990 --> 32:36.950
the first drop.

32:36.990 --> 32:38.160
The airport.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.200
Call Monica.
Tell her where we're headed.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.540
Des --

32:41.580 --> 32:42.830
It's a phone call. How am I
gonna mess that up?

32:42.870 --> 32:44.670
Just tell Monica to meet
us at the airport.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.560
Oh. Thank you
very much.

33:08.440 --> 33:09.820
[Malachy] Hey Rose.

33:09.860 --> 33:13.450
Hey. Listen. Griffin and
Carlotta, I think, well, I think

33:13.490 --> 33:14.740
they're having an affair.

33:14.780 --> 33:16.490
So Joe was right.
She was stepping out.

33:16.530 --> 33:18.910
So why would she stage
a kidnapping. I mean --

33:18.950 --> 33:20.490
maybe she needs the money.

33:20.540 --> 33:24.040
They stayed at the McKeon Motel
a couple of times together.

33:24.080 --> 33:25.870
Yeah, it's right here
in the reservation book.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.590
-Thanks Rose. -Okay.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.220
Look, got him. He's over there.

33:38.890 --> 33:39.470
Alright, I guess we gotta move.

33:40.930 --> 33:43.230
Jake, we are not moving until we
have the proper backup.

33:43.270 --> 33:44.100
[phone vibrates]
With all due respect Monica,

33:45.390 --> 33:47.310
I don't think now is a good time
for us to delay.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.690
He's calling me. Sssh.

33:50.650 --> 33:52.110
Griffin.

33:52.150 --> 33:55.110
So I guess now that you got your
cash, you could just hand

33:55.150 --> 33:56.910
Scarlett over right?

33:56.950 --> 33:59.870
That's why I'm calling to thank
you for getting me the money.

34:00.780 --> 34:02.620
Everything worked out after all.

34:02.660 --> 34:04.200
No, no. This isn't over

34:04.250 --> 34:06.250
until you give us back
the little girl.

34:06.290 --> 34:08.210
No. I don't think so.

34:08.250 --> 34:09.630
Excuse me?

34:09.670 --> 34:11.170
Well, my ride will be here soon

34:11.210 --> 34:12.000
and Scarlett will be
coming with us.

34:13.300 --> 34:15.470
I doubt you and I will speak
again after this.

34:15.510 --> 34:18.850
It's been a slice Doyle, but I
had to call. I don't know why.

34:19.550 --> 34:21.050
I guess I wanted to.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.640
Do I know you somethin'? What's
your beef with me exactly?

34:23.680 --> 34:27.690
No. You don't know me. Not
personally. But guys like you.

34:29.190 --> 34:31.270
Remember that you alone are
the reason the girl wasn't

34:31.310 --> 34:34.740
returned to her parents.
Don't ever forget that.

34:35.820 --> 34:39.280
Dad...
He doesn't know we're here.

34:45.410 --> 34:48.580
[Jake]
Hey Griffin! Buddy!

34:48.620 --> 34:50.330
I've been looking around town
for you all day.

34:51.500 --> 34:53.670
So, what do you think?

34:53.710 --> 34:54.420
Let's end this whole thing

34:55.590 --> 34:57.510
and you hand Scarlett
over right now.

34:57.550 --> 34:58.630
Back off.

34:59.930 --> 35:01.850
Unfortunately I don't
think that can happen.

35:01.890 --> 35:04.060
I'm almost glad you said that.

35:04.100 --> 35:05.520
You were warned.

35:08.730 --> 35:10.060
Ohhh!

35:12.520 --> 35:14.480
Carlotta. Grab Scarlett and go.

35:14.520 --> 35:15.440
I'll meet you after I'm done
with this idiot.

35:17.030 --> 35:19.450
No. I told you I didn't want any
of this. Just stop. Please!

35:20.530 --> 35:21.910
[punch]

35:23.700 --> 35:24.830
I can't believe that worked.

35:24.870 --> 35:26.540
I need you to stop right there.

35:28.290 --> 35:29.580
Let's get you out of here.

35:34.710 --> 35:36.300
How dare you take
my girl away from me!

35:36.340 --> 35:38.010
Which one Joey?

35:38.050 --> 35:41.220
Joe. Griffin and Carlotta --
they were in this together.

35:42.510 --> 35:48.020
Please don't -- I -- It wasn't
-- I didn't --

35:48.060 --> 35:51.230
So what happened?
Joe found out about the affair?

35:51.270 --> 35:53.520
He was gonna leave you and you'd
lose everything.

35:53.560 --> 35:55.150
Some kind of pre-nup,
I'm guessing?

35:55.190 --> 35:57.650
I was gonna end up
on the street. I had no choice.

35:57.690 --> 35:59.780
So you arranged for your
boyfriend to kidnap your own

35:59.820 --> 36:00.950
daughter for the money?

36:02.950 --> 36:05.240
What happened when the first
money drop went wrong?

36:05.280 --> 36:06.780
Why didn't you give up?

36:06.830 --> 36:08.790
I told Griffin to stop and just
let my Scarlett go,

36:08.830 --> 36:10.040
but he wouldn't listen.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.580
I had nothing to do
with things since then.

36:11.620 --> 36:14.290
What? You're pretending you're
clean in this?

36:14.330 --> 36:16.290
I did it for you, and for us.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.960
Are you going to leave it
hanging on me after everything?

36:19.010 --> 36:20.340
[sirens]

36:20.380 --> 36:23.590
He's -- I'm begging you.
It's all okay now.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.010
She's back with us.
Can't we just walk away?

36:27.640 --> 36:32.230
No. It doesn't work like that.
You can't just turn it back now.

36:32.270 --> 36:33.940
If I go down, you go down too.

36:33.980 --> 36:37.940
Griffin. Look around.
You're definitely going down.

36:37.980 --> 36:41.280
Well, you and I will pick this
up at another time then.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.620
She's in the back.

36:50.950 --> 36:54.080
Were you scared? Yeah?

36:57.250 --> 36:59.250
I know it doesn't look like it.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.800
But I'm one of the good guys,
okay?

37:01.840 --> 37:03.550
Come here, honey.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.850
So how are you doing?
It's a lot to take in.

37:15.440 --> 37:18.820
To be honest, the quicker this
is over, the quicker I can start

37:18.860 --> 37:20.440
the process of moving on.

37:20.480 --> 37:23.190
Scarlett's finally safe now.
That's what matters most.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.110
You know, she may just be my
stepdaughter, but I love her

37:25.160 --> 37:26.610
like she's my own.

37:26.660 --> 37:29.660
I guess it's just going to be
the two of us from now on.

37:31.240 --> 37:35.460
Uh, look, I know that I didn't
show it, but I really do

37:35.500 --> 37:37.750
appreciate everything
that you did for me.

37:37.790 --> 37:39.290
For us.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.300
I wish you the best of luck.

37:41.340 --> 37:44.340
Take care of yourself,
and the little one, hey?

37:48.970 --> 37:52.770
So what do you say father?
The first round's on me.

37:52.810 --> 37:54.390
First time I've ever
heard you say that.

37:56.020 --> 37:58.190
I've said it lots of times. I've
just never followed up on it.

38:04.740 --> 38:07.910
Four more hours left of this
stupid shift. You're lucky.

38:07.950 --> 38:09.200
You're done for the night.

38:09.240 --> 38:11.580
Tell me about it.

38:14.790 --> 38:20.590
He's got an eye on you. Careful.
He's a rough one. Trust me.

38:20.630 --> 38:22.130
[beep]

38:38.940 --> 38:42.360
I called and texted a bunch of
times. Where were you to?

38:43.440 --> 38:44.190
I was shopping.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.150
Cell service in
the mall is shits.

38:50.070 --> 38:51.030
Come on.

38:52.490 --> 38:53.950
You're not even
the least bit interested

38:53.990 --> 38:55.330
to know what I bought?

38:56.870 --> 38:59.120
I had to get something nice
to go with this gorgeous

38:59.170 --> 39:00.750
necklace you got me.

39:01.920 --> 39:02.960
Yeah?

39:04.130 --> 39:05.920
Are you at least
gonna show it to me?

39:05.960 --> 39:09.260
Maybe. If you're lucky.

39:09.300 --> 39:10.300
Come on.

39:11.340 --> 39:12.970
Let's me and you get outa here.

39:13.010 --> 39:14.680
Go someplace quiet.

39:15.470 --> 39:16.560
Hmm?

39:21.810 --> 39:23.480
You know Jacob.

39:27.150 --> 39:30.110
I never tell ya --
at least not enough --

39:30.160 --> 39:32.160
that you're a...

39:32.200 --> 39:33.990
you're a good investigator.

39:35.830 --> 39:38.000
One glass of whiskey and already
the tears are coming?

39:38.040 --> 39:39.920
I haven't had a drop.
I'm serious.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.000
You saved a little girl today.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.000
You did good.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.090
And I'm not ashamed to tell you.

39:46.130 --> 39:47.670
[click] Good work.

39:48.510 --> 39:49.550
You too.

39:51.260 --> 39:52.510
Hey.

39:53.390 --> 39:54.600
Are we gonna head home?

39:54.640 --> 39:56.640
Umm... Long day.

39:58.390 --> 39:59.560
Night kids.

40:01.770 --> 40:02.730
Don't be too late.

40:07.860 --> 40:09.240
What's wrong with you?

40:12.450 --> 40:14.120
What?

40:14.160 --> 40:18.830
I'd tell you if I could, believe
me, but there's some things that

40:18.870 --> 40:20.210
I just cannot share.

40:21.580 --> 40:24.880
Just know that as soon as I can
unload the burden

40:25.840 --> 40:27.920
you'll be the first to know.

40:29.340 --> 40:30.470
Alright.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.530
Listen kid, it's getting a
little late here for me to be

40:52.570 --> 40:54.570
answering stupid questions,
so what do you want?

40:54.620 --> 40:55.410
Sorry...

40:56.160 --> 40:57.370
I needed to talk to you,

40:57.410 --> 40:59.450
but if you want me to go,
I will.

40:59.490 --> 41:00.910
I'm sorry. That was...

41:00.950 --> 41:04.040
That was rude of me.
I apologize.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.380
What happened to your face?

41:06.420 --> 41:08.000
Uh...

41:08.040 --> 41:10.010
Things get a little boisterous
in here, as you can imagine.

41:11.630 --> 41:13.970
I was a certain ways into the
process of figuring out how to

41:14.010 --> 41:17.680
get back at the guy who did this
to me and then you showed up.

41:17.720 --> 41:18.850
That sucks.

41:18.890 --> 41:20.770
Well, you know, I'm...

41:20.810 --> 41:22.180
I am slowly learning

41:22.230 --> 41:24.810
that revenge is
a fairly useless motivator.

41:26.940 --> 41:28.190
So what can I do for you?

41:30.440 --> 41:33.150
Okay. Come on.
How about we just tick

41:33.190 --> 41:35.610
off some of those boxes on
the psych review, alright?

41:37.200 --> 41:40.790
No, I was not a bed wetter.
No, I'm not a bed wetter now.

41:41.950 --> 41:44.460
No, I have not tortured
small animals.

41:44.500 --> 41:49.130
No. You toyed with bigger
ones instead. Like me.

41:49.170 --> 41:49.460
We're back there again?

41:51.000 --> 41:54.300
Look, perhaps we just shouldn't
touch on the subject of

41:54.340 --> 41:56.340
our little run in.

41:57.260 --> 41:59.510
Look kid, honestly. I'm curious.

42:01.100 --> 42:03.020
So why don't you do us both
a big favour and just tell me

42:03.060 --> 42:05.100
what is on your mind.

42:05.980 --> 42:07.940
What is your favourite band?

42:08.730 --> 42:10.150
It's The Clash.

42:10.190 --> 42:11.320
Yeah?

42:12.480 --> 42:13.940
I like them a lot.

42:13.990 --> 42:16.700
Ah, good. We got something
in common. That's good for us.

42:18.240 --> 42:20.160
We've got more than that
in common.

42:20.200 --> 42:21.870
How do you figure that?

42:24.330 --> 42:26.210
You're my father.

42:28.040 --> 42:30.750
I thought it was
about time you knew.

42:30.790 --> 42:32.300
I'm your kid.
