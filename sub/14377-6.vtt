15:29.016 --> 15:31.250
Power up.

15:33.450 --> 15:35.300
All that is left now

15:35.333 --> 15:37.366
is to go there.

15:40.133 --> 15:42.183
Aah!

15:42.216 --> 15:44.150
She's too fast!

15:44.183 --> 15:46.050
What a flight!

15:46.083 --> 15:48.483
Must regain control!

15:59.466 --> 16:02.316
No!

16:22.000 --> 16:23.116
Huh?

16:23.150 --> 16:25.416
What is this place?

16:27.200 --> 16:30.383
Tell you what, though,
some crash!

16:30.416 --> 16:33.250
Ooh-hoo.
Computer give me

16:33.283 --> 16:36.400
a complete readout
on my exact location.

16:36.433 --> 16:39.366
Computer?

16:39.400 --> 16:42.033
Computer!

16:42.066 --> 16:43.116
[Nervous laughter]

16:43.150 --> 16:46.350
Ok, Dexter,
you traveled so far so fast,

16:46.383 --> 16:49.433
you put yourself
out of range of communication.

16:49.466 --> 16:54.133
Just relax.
It's no biggie.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.200
Aah!

16:56.233 --> 16:58.333
Help, someone!

16:58.366 --> 17:01.233
I am so lost
I cannot be found.

17:01.266 --> 17:03.333
I am up a paddle
with no creek.

17:03.366 --> 17:06.066
Dee Dee, lisping:
Dexter, hey,
I'll give you 20 bucks

17:06.100 --> 17:10.483
for a bowl
of my most favorite bowl
of fruity tooty cereal.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.400
Dexter? Dexter?

17:16.433 --> 17:20.233
Ooh!

17:22.366 --> 17:25.066
[Imitates accelerating engine]

17:25.100 --> 17:27.216
[Imitates screeching brakes]

17:27.250 --> 17:30.250
Look out!
We're going to crash!

17:32.150 --> 17:34.100
Button, button,

17:34.133 --> 17:37.250
who's got the button?

17:45.133 --> 17:49.050
A failure must be noted.

17:50.250 --> 17:54.416
I must be
in the old part of the lab.

17:55.066 --> 17:57.100
Perhaps I can find
something useful

17:57.133 --> 18:00.016
in this pile of garbage.

18:00.233 --> 18:03.300
Wait a second.
I remember you,

18:03.333 --> 18:07.083
but I haven't seen you since--

18:10.166 --> 18:12.233
[squeaking]

18:12.266 --> 18:14.016
At last,

18:14.050 --> 18:18.233
my greatest work
is completed!

18:32.450 --> 18:34.133
Cute.

18:34.166 --> 18:36.366
Now to be found.

18:43.116 --> 18:44.416
[Mechanical voice]
Halt!

18:44.450 --> 18:46.416
Who--who are you?

18:46.450 --> 18:50.266
We are
your early creations.

18:50.300 --> 18:53.366
You invented us
one...

18:53.400 --> 18:54.333
By one.

18:54.366 --> 18:58.200
We were all
your greatest work...

18:58.233 --> 19:00.466
Machines:
But you abandoned us,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.383
and now you shall pay
for your neglect.

19:03.416 --> 19:06.166
Uh, but, uh,
you see, uh,

19:06.200 --> 19:08.450
it wasn't my fault, i--

19:08.483 --> 19:10.450
look, it's r2d2!

19:10.483 --> 19:12.400
Machines:
Where?

19:12.433 --> 19:14.433
Alert. He's escaping.

19:14.466 --> 19:17.166
R2d2 is not here.

19:17.400 --> 19:21.050
Whoa! Woo!

19:21.083 --> 19:24.133
Whoa!

19:27.250 --> 19:28.200
Ooh!

19:28.233 --> 19:31.216
What's this?

19:31.250 --> 19:34.083
I remember this.

19:38.150 --> 19:40.233
[Ringing loudly]

19:40.266 --> 19:43.033
Waah!

19:43.066 --> 19:46.200
I got to show this
to Dexter.

19:46.233 --> 19:48.116
He'll laugh!

19:48.150 --> 19:51.033
[Whispering]
Perhaps I have lost them.

19:51.066 --> 19:51.433
[Groans]

19:51.466 --> 19:55.183
Converge!
Converge! Converge!

19:58.416 --> 20:01.100
Weaponry!

20:02.100 --> 20:05.316
Filthy ancient technology,
stop that!

20:10.483 --> 20:13.283
Simply put,
I'm doomed.

20:14.433 --> 20:16.216
Help!

20:16.250 --> 20:19.116
Whee!

20:19.150 --> 20:20.250
Dee Dee?

20:20.283 --> 20:22.283
Dexter,
look what I found!

20:22.316 --> 20:24.333
Dee Dee,
you found me!

20:24.366 --> 20:26.316
I also found this--

20:26.350 --> 20:28.366
your first invention,
remember?

20:28.400 --> 20:30.350
Who cares
about that
stupid invention?

20:30.383 --> 20:32.450
You can take me
out of here.

20:32.483 --> 20:33.466
Tsk, Tsk, Tsk.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.450
Dexter,
I'm surprised at you.

20:35.483 --> 20:38.133
Look what's happening
to you now

20:38.166 --> 20:39.300
because of your neglect.

20:39.333 --> 20:42.350
By the time
you finish
one invention,

20:42.383 --> 20:44.366
you're preoccupied
with your next.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.266
You don't care
about any of them.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.083
You're right,
Dee Dee.

20:49.116 --> 20:51.133
I've never given
enough attention

20:51.166 --> 20:53.333
to all
of these creatures.

20:53.366 --> 20:57.066
I'm so sorry.
If I only knew...

20:57.100 --> 20:58.000
[Sobs]

20:58.033 --> 20:59.166
My sweet darling,

20:59.200 --> 21:01.133
how I remember
you well,

21:01.166 --> 21:04.150
how I used to push
your button...

21:04.183 --> 21:07.000
[Ringing]

21:07.033 --> 21:10.166
[Machines malfunctioning]

21:10.200 --> 21:11.116
[Crash]

21:11.150 --> 21:13.333
Hey, they've all
been deactivated.

21:13.366 --> 21:17.250
I'm saved. Let us
get out of here.

21:17.433 --> 21:19.300
Now that
that's over with,

21:19.333 --> 21:22.050
I can start work
on my newest creation,

21:22.083 --> 21:24.266
an advanced version
of the hovercraft.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.333
Then I will be able to--
