00:26.504 --> 00:29.246
Still not a fan
of these things?

00:29.290 --> 00:31.944
Getting all dolled up
to kiss the ring seems like

00:31.988 --> 00:33.511
a giant waste
of time to me.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.426
Well, let me suggest
that you never run

00:35.470 --> 00:36.514
for U.S. Senate.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.081
Sort of feels like

00:38.125 --> 00:39.517
that's 90% of what I do.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.041
I'd rather be working.

00:41.084 --> 00:42.955
No offense.None taken.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.653
Truth is...

00:44.696 --> 00:48.178
I only RSVP'd
to this shindig to see you.

00:48.222 --> 00:49.701
I didn't think
you would agree

00:49.745 --> 00:51.138
to meet with me any other way.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.096
You're right.
I wouldn't have.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.706
Wait, Matty.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.187
I need your help.

00:57.231 --> 00:59.233
Yesterday I received

00:59.276 --> 01:01.887
a very disturbing e-mail.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.759
Whoever sent it
is demanding $10,000,

01:03.802 --> 01:05.935
or they're gonna release
photos of me...

01:05.978 --> 01:07.458
with a woman.

01:08.764 --> 01:12.463
Senator, our history
allows you the privilege

01:12.507 --> 01:14.726
of knowing about
the organization
that I work for.

01:14.770 --> 01:17.512
But if you've been hacked,
you need to take that up

01:17.555 --> 01:19.644
with the FBI Cyber Unit,
just like everybody else.

01:19.688 --> 01:21.255
I wasn't hacked.

01:21.298 --> 01:24.258
Someone somehow got their hands
on one of my old computers.

01:24.301 --> 01:28.131
Huh. Well, then it seems like
you have two choices.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.915
One, pay the ransom,

01:29.959 --> 01:31.265
and hope your wife
doesn't find out.

01:31.308 --> 01:33.528
Or two, don't pay,
and come clean

01:33.571 --> 01:36.139
before this blackmailer
outs you.

01:36.183 --> 01:39.316
I strongly
suggest option "B."

01:40.361 --> 01:41.623
Good night, Senator.

01:41.666 --> 01:44.321
I wish it was
that simple, Matty.

01:45.366 --> 01:47.803
That same computer
has another file

01:47.846 --> 01:51.111
that this blackmailer
doesn't realize they have yet.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.590
It's a file

01:52.634 --> 01:56.290
from my time on the committee
overseeing covert ops.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.337
It's Dragonfly.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.166
Dragonfly?

02:03.210 --> 02:05.386
Are you sure?

02:13.959 --> 02:15.918
MATTY:
Meet Senator

02:15.961 --> 02:17.789
Todd Steckler from Ohio.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.400
Two years ago, one
of his aides wiped

02:19.443 --> 02:22.403
his office computer and brought
it to a recycling center.

02:22.446 --> 02:24.144
But instead of it

02:24.187 --> 02:27.495
being recycled, it was illegally
shipped overseas to Ghana.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.192
Why would
somebody's old computer

02:29.236 --> 02:31.151
be sent all the way to Ghana?

02:31.194 --> 02:33.283
Because it's more expensive
to recycle electronic waste here

02:33.327 --> 02:35.503
than to export it
to a developing country

02:35.546 --> 02:37.983
where it gets dumped
in a landfill and forgotten.

02:38.027 --> 02:40.247
Really?
Sadly,
Mac's correct.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.205
Some of the most reputable
recycling services

02:42.249 --> 02:44.425
do this under the radar.

02:44.468 --> 02:47.210
I don't know how many computers
I've thrown out in my life.

02:47.254 --> 02:49.256
You're telling me there's
a chance they're rotting in one

02:49.299 --> 02:50.822
of those landfills?MacGYVER: Unfortunately,
a very good chance.

02:50.866 --> 02:54.130
Almost 50 million tons
every year of junked TVs,

02:54.174 --> 02:57.046
computers and cell phones
make the exact same trip.

02:57.089 --> 02:58.961
All right, so what happened
to the senator's computer

02:59.004 --> 03:00.571
once it got to Ghana?

03:00.615 --> 03:03.183
All we know is that once the
computer was shipped overseas,

03:03.226 --> 03:05.228
it fell into the hands
of an extortionist,

03:05.272 --> 03:07.448
who, 36 hours ago,

03:07.491 --> 03:08.753
sent this e-mail.

03:08.797 --> 03:11.234
Um...

03:11.278 --> 03:13.454
Matty, that's an e-mail
threatening to expose

03:13.497 --> 03:15.325
Steckler
for cheating on his wife.That's correct.

03:15.369 --> 03:16.848
JACK:
I'll take this one, Ri.
I think

03:16.892 --> 03:18.894
what she's trying to say is,
what is Senator Scumbag's

03:18.937 --> 03:21.549
personal trash doing
in the Phoenix's lap?

03:21.592 --> 03:24.987
Because those photos aren't
the only sensitive material

03:25.030 --> 03:27.294
on that computer.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.338
There is also

03:28.382 --> 03:30.297
a file called Dragonfly.

03:30.340 --> 03:33.256
It is this file
that I need retrieved

03:33.300 --> 03:34.692
before the extortionist
stumbles onto it.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.172
JACK:
And there it is.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.869
Okay, that makes more sense.

03:37.913 --> 03:40.176
What is this Dragonfly, exactly?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.396
That information
is need to know.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.963
Now, the four of you
need to hurry, or you
will miss your flight.

03:45.007 --> 03:47.357
There's a car waiting
to take you to LAX.

03:49.011 --> 03:51.361
Matty, you just said LAX.

03:51.405 --> 03:53.145
We don't usually fly
out of there.Today you do.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.408
You're flying commercial.

03:54.451 --> 03:55.887

11:15.718 --> 11:17.024
that can be sold in town.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.852
Uh, circuit boards, cameras,

11:18.895 --> 11:20.418
batteries, monitors, keyboards.

11:20.462 --> 11:23.726
What do computer fans go for?

11:23.770 --> 11:25.423
Uh, 19 cents a pound.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.687
Uh, LCD screens
are the real prize.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.036
Those go for 60 cents each.

11:29.079 --> 11:30.864
80 if they're not cracked.

11:30.907 --> 11:33.127
Those always go quick at
the beginning of the day.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.998
Most kids sleep here
so that they can

11:35.042 --> 11:37.000
get in first,
and get to the best stuffs.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.311
Danso, what did I tell you

11:43.354 --> 11:45.095
about cracking
those printer cartridges open?

11:45.139 --> 11:46.140
They're full
of poison.

11:46.183 --> 11:48.882
Mind if I show you
another way?

11:55.802 --> 11:58.413
Cellular PCB boards are made

11:58.456 --> 12:00.981
from epoxy resin,
which makes them

12:01.024 --> 12:03.200
incredibly strong, so
you can use one of these

12:03.244 --> 12:04.724
as a lever...

12:06.464 --> 12:08.858
...to pry this casing open...

12:10.077 --> 12:12.688
...without throwing toxic ink

12:12.732 --> 12:15.125
in the air.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.954
Thank you.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.130
You're welcome.JACK:
Hey, maybe I'm missing

12:20.174 --> 12:21.871
something here,
but how is it even possible

12:21.915 --> 12:23.046
to blackmail the senator

12:23.090 --> 12:24.134
if everything that gets

12:24.178 --> 12:25.788
sent here is-is broken down

12:25.832 --> 12:27.398
for scrap metal?

12:27.442 --> 12:30.053
Well, because not everything
is broken down. Follow me.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.969
There's more.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.239
Hard drives are pulled
from computers and brought here

12:42.283 --> 12:45.547
where they can be scanned for
pictures, e-mails, videos,

12:45.590 --> 12:48.637
anything that can be used to
blackmail their previous owners.

12:48.680 --> 12:52.293
MacGYVER:
You guys built a sophisticated
data-mining operation

12:52.336 --> 12:53.729
entirely out of
other peoples' junk.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.949
RILEY: So you're scraping
through text messages

12:55.992 --> 12:57.733
and e-mails, using key words

12:57.777 --> 13:00.170
looking for proof of behavior
that can be blackmailed,

13:00.214 --> 13:01.955
but how did you find
explicit photos?

13:01.998 --> 13:03.173
I wrote the script that looks

13:03.217 --> 13:04.261
for color values,
matching skin tones.

13:05.610 --> 13:09.745
I'm not saying any
of this is okay, but, damn.

13:10.528 --> 13:12.052
This is where

13:12.095 --> 13:14.489
Joseph locks the hard drives
that have data on them.

13:14.532 --> 13:16.970
But like I said,
he has the only key.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.493
JACK:
Ah, don't worry about that.

13:18.536 --> 13:21.148
When it comes to locked doors,
my boy Mac, here--

13:21.191 --> 13:22.323
he's undefeated.

13:22.366 --> 13:25.587
BOZER:
So, after we have
the hard drive,

13:25.630 --> 13:26.936
we're all in agreement,

13:26.980 --> 13:29.069
we're definitely taking a peek
at Dragonfly.

13:29.112 --> 13:30.505
Right?
Nah.

13:30.548 --> 13:31.898
Matty would know
we looked.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.116
Not if we get

13:33.160 --> 13:34.770
Riley to help.Oh, yeah.

13:34.814 --> 13:38.208
Ri.
What makes you assume
I'd want to help?

13:38.252 --> 13:40.297
BOZER:
I mean, that's what you do.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.603
I mean, I'm just saying.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.780
It's Matty.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.913
Why is she calling me?
She never calls me.

13:46.956 --> 13:49.219
You think she knows
I was just talking about her?Yeah, probably.

13:50.264 --> 13:53.180
Hey, Matty.
How are you?

13:53.223 --> 13:54.790
In need of a status update,
Bozer.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.748
Do you have
the senator's drive?

13:56.792 --> 13:59.839
Uh... your timing
is terrifying, as ever.

13:59.882 --> 14:02.102
Uh, yes, we are seconds away
from having

14:02.145 --> 14:03.538
the hard drive in hand.MATTY:
Good.

14:03.581 --> 14:06.062
The moment you confirm
Dragonfly is on that drive,

14:06.106 --> 14:07.890
I want you on your way
to the airport.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.066
BOZER:
Copy that.

14:14.723 --> 14:17.073
MacGYVER:
What's going on?

14:17.117 --> 14:19.119
Joseph is here.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.511
Bozer?Call you back, Matty.

14:22.078 --> 14:23.863
He wasn't supposed
to come today.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.342
You have to hide.

14:25.386 --> 14:26.343
JACK:
Hide?

14:26.387 --> 14:27.692
I hate to break it
to you, kiddo,

14:27.736 --> 14:29.781
but Jack Dalton doesn't hide
from anybody,

14:29.825 --> 14:31.958
especially not dudes
named Joseph.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.569
Please. You have to.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.136
If he finds out
I brought you here...

14:36.179 --> 14:37.224
Just tell us where.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.182
MacGYVER: Jack...

14:39.226 --> 14:42.316
Okay, but for the record,
this is under protest.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.581
MAN:
Get out of the way!Good God.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.365
MacGYVER:
Shh.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.759
:
What, these kids
sleep in here?

14:55.677 --> 14:59.550
[engine revs, tires screech,
horn honks]

15:22.008 --> 15:24.445
Welcome, sir.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.971
I trust all is here.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.581
Oh, come on, Mac.
We got to do something.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.496
Anything we do impulsively here

15:32.540 --> 15:34.542
could make their lives
a lot worse.

15:34.585 --> 15:35.891
Worse than this?

15:41.462 --> 15:43.029
BOZER:
Abina said the
senator's drive

15:43.072 --> 15:44.465
was somewhere
in that stack.

15:44.508 --> 15:45.466
Mac, we can't just
let 'em take it.

15:45.509 --> 15:46.684
We're not gonna make a move here

15:46.728 --> 15:47.990
and endanger
these kids' lives.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.519
:
Get back to work!

16:11.535 --> 16:12.928
We got to get to the van.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.321
If we lose Joseph,
we lose the hard drive.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.149
JACK: Yeah,
hold on now.

16:16.192 --> 16:18.194
That road we took
in here was wide open.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.327
They'll spot us immediately
if we try to follow 'em,

16:20.370 --> 16:21.937
especially in that
soccer mom van.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.766
So what do we do? Just let the
reason we came here speed away?

16:24.809 --> 16:27.334
Abina, do you know where
he's taking that hard drive?

16:27.377 --> 16:29.292
Yes. His house.

16:29.336 --> 16:31.294
Can you take us there?

16:31.338 --> 16:33.340
I can, but it
will cost you.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.180
RILEY:
Abina, for future reference,

16:47.223 --> 16:49.356
that is not a house.

16:49.399 --> 16:50.835
That is a fortress.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.968
JACK:
Yeah, a fortress paid for
by poor people

16:53.012 --> 16:54.187
and the sweat of little kids.

16:54.230 --> 16:55.449
BOZER:
Agreed.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.320
So how are we gonna get past
all of that

16:57.364 --> 16:58.452
and get inside?

17:00.106 --> 17:02.064
Mac?

17:02.108 --> 17:04.066
I don't know.

17:06.503 --> 17:07.896
Yet.

17:14.598 --> 17:15.991
MATTY:
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.037
You were just
one picked lock away

17:18.080 --> 17:20.082
from retrieving that drive,
but backed off?

17:20.126 --> 17:22.084
And now,
it's being kept inside

17:22.128 --> 17:23.868
a compound guarded by

17:23.912 --> 17:25.392
four lookout towers
and a small army?

17:25.435 --> 17:26.915
MacGYVER:
Yeah.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.091
That pretty much sums it up,
but I assure you

17:29.135 --> 17:31.485
that the circumstances made it
impossible to make a move

17:31.528 --> 17:32.747
on the hard drive earlier.Give me that thing.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.750
Matty, relax.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.708
We're gonna get your
little file back, okay?

17:37.752 --> 17:38.927
Don't worry. It's just gonna be

17:38.970 --> 17:41.147
a little bit tougher
than we originally

17:41.190 --> 17:42.800
anticipated.MATTY:
Oh.

17:42.844 --> 17:44.150
That's really great
to hear, Jack.

17:44.193 --> 17:45.890
Now tell me

17:45.934 --> 17:47.936
Okay.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.548
Here. Why don't
you take that one?

17:51.592 --> 17:52.593
Thanks.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.856
Still ironing out the details,

17:54.899 --> 17:58.860
but... look, I know
I can make it over the fence.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.253
It's the lookout towers
that are another story.

18:00.296 --> 18:01.950
They have sight lines
in every direction.

18:01.993 --> 18:04.039
I can move the
guards for you.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.997
Uh, sorry, kid, okay?
No more moola.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.086
You already cleaned us out.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.870
It's okay.
I don't want money.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.089
If I do this,

18:10.132 --> 18:12.961
I want to come home with you.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.922
Give me that thing.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.620
Did you, uh...?

18:19.663 --> 18:21.883
Did you hear
that, Matty?

18:21.926 --> 18:23.493
Yes, Jack, I did,

18:23.537 --> 18:25.887
and while I feel terrible
for this young girl,

18:25.930 --> 18:28.890
I can't just pull
a random civilian out

18:28.933 --> 18:30.413
of her home country!Yeah. I'm not saying...

18:30.457 --> 18:32.111
A country I can't even
acknowledge

18:32.154 --> 18:33.634
that my agents are currently in.Hey, I understand...

18:33.677 --> 18:35.810
Hey, Matty, listen,
Abina's the key

18:35.853 --> 18:36.985
to accomplishing
our objective.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.421
Without her help,

18:38.465 --> 18:40.771
we might as well just leave
right now, empty-handed.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.121
So exactly

18:42.164 --> 18:44.253
how bad do you want
whatever's on that drive?

18:47.909 --> 18:51.130
Tell the young lady
she has my word

18:51.173 --> 18:54.089
I will do everything I can
to get her somewhere safe.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.612
But that will have

18:55.656 --> 18:57.048
to be good enough for now.

18:57.092 --> 18:59.138
Thank you, Matty.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.618
Wheels are in motion
to bring you home with us.

19:01.662 --> 19:04.491
So what's your plan
for getting past the lookouts?

19:09.887 --> 19:11.062
Yes.

19:11.106 --> 19:12.281
ABINA:
Joseph.

19:12.325 --> 19:13.978
It's Abina. You
have to come quick.

19:14.022 --> 19:15.719
The Sakawa Boys are
raiding the landfill again.

19:15.763 --> 19:17.286
You have to hurry.
They're taking everything.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.027
Quick! Back to the yard!

19:19.070 --> 19:20.333
Now!

19:20.376 --> 19:21.812
There.

19:21.856 --> 19:24.163
That should do it.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.556
Move it! Quick! The Sakawa Boys
are at the landfill.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.167
Move!

19:52.930 --> 19:54.889
This place is freaking
huge, man.

19:54.932 --> 19:57.065
What do you say
we divide and conquer

19:57.108 --> 19:58.806
Before old Joe-Joe
realizes he's being duped.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.590
Bozer and I will take the main
house, you take the back.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.940
BOZER:
Signal if you find the drive.

20:13.299 --> 20:16.084
Hey, Boze,
how serious were you

20:16.127 --> 20:18.173
about checking Dragonfly
behind Matty's back?

20:18.217 --> 20:21.045
I mean, she knows everything
about our lives, Mac,

20:21.089 --> 20:23.613
but what do we
know about her?

20:23.657 --> 20:26.007
Not much.
It's how she wants it.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.401
Sure, but whatever's
on that drive,

20:28.444 --> 20:30.794
Matty just agreed to airlift
Abina out of Ghana

20:30.838 --> 20:32.579
to ensure she
got it back.

20:32.622 --> 20:34.668
How could we not look?

20:36.278 --> 20:39.281
I found embarrassing photos on
hundreds of computers before,

20:39.325 --> 20:42.415
but no one has ever
showed up to get them back.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.678
So what else is
on that drive?

20:47.768 --> 20:49.509
Honestly...

20:49.552 --> 20:52.512
all we know is it's really
important to our boss.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.209
So you're risking your lives
for your boss

20:54.253 --> 20:55.471
and you don't even know why?

20:57.343 --> 20:59.475
She must be a good woman.

20:59.519 --> 21:01.956
She is.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.958
Don't worry.

21:04.001 --> 21:05.307
If my boss says
she'll do anything

21:05.351 --> 21:06.308
to get you out
of Ghana,

21:06.352 --> 21:07.614
she means it.

21:11.792 --> 21:15.274
When I was young
and working as a scavenger,

21:15.317 --> 21:18.668
I always used to wonder
where the electronics came from.

21:18.712 --> 21:22.019
And then Joseph made me
start searching hard drives,

21:22.063 --> 21:25.240
and... I saw the photos.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.242
And the more I saw,

21:27.286 --> 21:30.071
the more I dreamed of living one
of those lives.

21:30.114 --> 21:31.638
Well,

21:31.681 --> 21:33.553
what'd you see yourself doing?

21:35.294 --> 21:37.861
Majoring in computer science.

21:37.905 --> 21:40.211
At a university in Boston

21:40.255 --> 21:42.083
or California.

21:43.432 --> 21:47.044
I'd live in a dorm
with my friends,

21:47.088 --> 21:48.829
take classes,

21:48.872 --> 21:51.353
go to parties.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.964
Your boss will let me do that?

21:54.008 --> 21:55.357
Yeah.

21:55.401 --> 21:56.358
Sure.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.968
You can do anything
you want,

21:58.012 --> 22:00.144
as long as you use
your skills to help people,

22:00.188 --> 22:01.320
not harm them.

22:04.758 --> 22:07.761
It's gonna feel
a lot better, Abina.

22:08.979 --> 22:11.808
Trust me.

22:23.298 --> 22:24.343
You two,

22:24.386 --> 22:25.866
stay here! You two,
the east side!

22:25.909 --> 22:27.998
The rest of you with me!

22:28.042 --> 22:30.392
You find the Sakawas...

22:30.436 --> 22:32.829
engage!

22:53.197 --> 22:55.330
:
Mac, you're up.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.989
Hey!
What are you two doing?

23:04.513 --> 23:07.168
Really?

23:07.211 --> 23:09.213
Don't you...

23:09.257 --> 23:11.172
Intruder! Intruder

23:11.215 --> 23:13.174
in the house!

23:13.217 --> 23:15.002
GUARD:
Intruder! Intruder!

23:15.045 --> 23:16.830
Intruder!Back to the house!

23:16.873 --> 23:18.005
Now!

23:22.531 --> 23:24.141
You got a faster way
through that door?

23:24.185 --> 23:26.492
Now that we can
make noise, I do.

23:28.232 --> 23:29.451
All right, Jack,
we got incoming.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.105
Five minutes, tops.
Any luck on your end?

23:31.148 --> 23:32.411
No hard drives
in the back house,

23:32.454 --> 23:34.325
just Joseph's
gross little man cave.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.936
On the bright side,
I did trash the place.

23:52.909 --> 23:54.737
Okay. All right.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.305
Which one's the senator's?No clue.

23:57.348 --> 23:58.611
Just start trying 'em.

24:13.364 --> 24:14.975
Mac, they're
surrounding the place

24:15.018 --> 24:16.716
and trapping you inside.
You got to get out of there.

24:16.759 --> 24:18.152
MacGYVER: We're doing
our best here, Riley.

24:18.195 --> 24:19.196
Would that help?

24:26.552 --> 24:28.423
JOSEPH: Spread out.
Search the perimeter.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.469
Look in the back house.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.559
Go downstairs.
You, come with me.

24:33.602 --> 24:35.082
We're out of time.

24:40.261 --> 24:42.742
Hey, hey, Mac.
This is it, right?

24:42.785 --> 24:44.004
Dragonfly, that's it.
Grab it. Let's go.Okay.

24:47.355 --> 24:48.791
Yo, Mac. What's up?

24:48.835 --> 24:49.792
We got the drive.

24:49.836 --> 24:50.793
Yeah! Yeah, good,

24:50.837 --> 24:52.099
let's get out of here.

24:52.142 --> 24:53.230
MAN:
There they are!

24:53.274 --> 24:54.275
We got company, boys.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.887
This way!

25:06.896 --> 25:08.289
I'm not gonna be able
to hold these guys off

25:08.332 --> 25:10.160
for too much longer.

25:19.039 --> 25:20.388
BOZER:
Look!

25:20.431 --> 25:23.086
Let's go, let's go!

25:23.130 --> 25:24.435
Let's go.

25:24.479 --> 25:26.350
Come on, let's go!

25:52.899 --> 25:53.769
JACK:
Yeah.

25:53.813 --> 25:54.814
Yeah, you're doing great, Riley.

25:54.857 --> 25:56.903
Just don't let your foot
off the gas.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.513
Wasn't planning on it, Jack.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.862
Okay, Matty,
we have the hard drive.

25:59.906 --> 26:02.386
That's a big "yee-haw"
on that one.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.737
Mission accomplished.
But, uh, we still got a problem.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.652
We need to get out
of Ghana, like, now.

26:06.695 --> 26:08.088
And we're taking
Abina with us.

26:08.131 --> 26:10.873
So, we're just hoping you have
her all-all squared away

26:10.917 --> 26:12.788
on that front, yeah?I'm working on it, Jack.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.834
I'll be in touch soon,
hopefully with good news.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.749
Hopefully's not gonna
cut it, Matty. We got to

26:16.792 --> 26:19.273
get Abina out of here or bad
things are gonna happen.MATTY: Riley,

26:19.316 --> 26:22.276
I recognize that you've taken
a liking to this young girl,

26:22.319 --> 26:23.756
but this op is off the books,

26:23.799 --> 26:25.932
remember?

26:25.975 --> 26:28.587
If we're gonna get Abina
out of Ghana, it has to be

26:28.630 --> 26:29.936
done legally.JACK: Yeah, we didn't forget.

26:29.979 --> 26:31.807
We're just hoping whatever
strings you're pulling,

26:31.851 --> 26:33.417
you-you pull 'em
rather quickly.

26:33.461 --> 26:35.028
We're in a bit of a pickle here.

26:51.914 --> 26:53.786
JACK:
Hey, am I seeing things,

26:53.829 --> 26:55.222
or did those dudes
just totally,

26:55.265 --> 26:56.310
randomly stop chasing us?

26:56.353 --> 26:58.312
They totally, randomly did.

26:58.355 --> 26:59.661
Which is either really good...

27:05.406 --> 27:08.061
...or really...Yeah, it's bad.

27:08.104 --> 27:09.932
Bozer, why is the
military chasing us?

27:09.976 --> 27:11.804
Joseph has powerful friends
in the government.

27:11.847 --> 27:13.414
That's how he keeps
the landfill operating.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.896
Did I mention
how much I hate this guy?

27:21.074 --> 27:23.032
Hey, Mac, you know
how annoying it is

27:23.076 --> 27:24.425
when Jack runs out of bullets?

27:24.468 --> 27:27.515
Well, that's about to happen
to us with random junk.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.913
We got company, Riley.
Okay, what you're gonna want

27:33.956 --> 27:37.046
to do here is a pursuit
intervention technique. First...

27:42.486 --> 27:43.879
Yeah, that'll work.

27:43.923 --> 27:46.316
That'll work.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.148
Wait, no, no, no, no,
not the microwave.

27:52.192 --> 27:53.454
What

27:53.497 --> 27:54.498
Riley, when I give you
the signal,

27:54.542 --> 27:55.935
stomp on the brakes.

27:55.978 --> 27:58.241
Brakes?Look, nobody's in the mood
to die today, dude.

27:58.285 --> 28:00.374
BOZER:
What is that thing?

28:00.417 --> 28:02.245
A magnetron.

28:02.289 --> 28:04.030
JACK:
Just tell me it's gonna
save our lives, please.

28:04.073 --> 28:05.161
MacGYVER:
I don't really have time

28:05.205 --> 28:06.728
for a lecture on

28:06.772 --> 28:08.208
electromagnetic fields.
I just need

28:08.251 --> 28:10.906
to get closer to the alternators
in the Jeeps' engines

28:10.950 --> 28:12.865
so I can fry them out
with this thing.

28:12.908 --> 28:14.867
Jack, plug this in.

28:17.434 --> 28:18.697
Okay, you're good.

28:23.963 --> 28:25.965
Mac, time to do
whatever you're doing.

28:26.008 --> 28:28.097
Bozer, hit the "popcorn" button.
Riley, hit the brakes!

28:33.015 --> 28:34.190
MacGYVER:
Inside every microwave oven

28:34.234 --> 28:36.105
is something called
a magnetron,

28:36.149 --> 28:38.629
which emits radio waves
at such a high frequency

28:38.673 --> 28:41.937
they excite the molecules inside whatever you're cooking.

28:41.981 --> 28:43.765
But if you remove the magnetron
from its housing

28:43.809 --> 28:46.855
and focus its energy
into a narrow beam,

28:46.899 --> 28:48.248
you can do a whole lot more

28:48.291 --> 28:49.728
than warm up
last night's leftovers.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.779
Yeah,
good driving, girl.

28:57.823 --> 29:00.521
Popcorn button?
Really?

29:02.915 --> 29:04.264
Great job, Mac.

29:13.316 --> 29:15.362
I've wondered
about this place.

29:15.405 --> 29:17.059
Never thought I'd
score an invite.

29:17.103 --> 29:18.887
Well, lucky for you
I don't trust you

29:18.931 --> 29:21.411
to have this conversation
anywhere else.

29:21.455 --> 29:23.065
You have an update?My team

29:23.109 --> 29:24.110
retrieved your drive.

29:26.852 --> 29:28.810
This is very good news.

29:28.854 --> 29:31.334
Before you start celebrating,
I need a favor from you.

29:31.378 --> 29:34.120
I need your help getting
someone out of Ghana.

29:34.163 --> 29:36.426
Who?A young girl
who helped my people

29:36.470 --> 29:37.950
accomplish their objective.

29:39.038 --> 29:41.997
If your people accomplished
their objective,

29:42.041 --> 29:44.957
then this young girl has
nothing more to offer.

29:46.132 --> 29:49.918
This girl is the only reason
why we have your photos.

29:49.962 --> 29:53.095
The only reason why
your marriage and career

29:53.139 --> 29:55.489
aren't gonna go down in flames.

29:59.188 --> 30:00.799
I'm sorry, I can't.

30:01.974 --> 30:02.931
I'd have to spend

30:02.975 --> 30:04.063
too much political capital

30:04.106 --> 30:05.629
to make that happen
under the radar.

30:06.761 --> 30:09.285
Besides, I already
did you one favor.

30:09.329 --> 30:11.548
Warning you Dragonfly
was at risk

30:11.592 --> 30:14.725
is the only reason
it won't be getting out.

30:14.769 --> 30:15.988
The only reason

30:16.031 --> 30:17.206
hislife...

30:19.818 --> 30:21.863
...won't be in immediate danger.

30:28.217 --> 30:32.004
You're gonna do me
one more favor today, Todd.

30:32.047 --> 30:34.093
Because if you don't,

30:34.136 --> 30:35.964
the photos of you
and that blonde

30:36.008 --> 30:38.749
are gonna make their way
into the inbox

30:38.793 --> 30:41.448
of every last staffer
and talking head

30:41.491 --> 30:43.406
in the district.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.582
You wouldn't.

30:45.626 --> 30:48.150
No secret stays buried forever.

30:51.632 --> 30:54.678
Okay, it's a dot AVI extension.

30:54.722 --> 30:57.029
Means it's a video file.

30:57.072 --> 30:58.900
Without even opening it, I can
see that it's over two gigs,

30:58.944 --> 31:00.293
created in 2010,
and protected with

31:00.336 --> 31:02.904
AES 256-bit encryption.

31:02.948 --> 31:03.905
Which means what,

31:03.949 --> 31:04.993
for those of us that were

31:05.037 --> 31:06.603
in the fifth grade twice?

31:06.647 --> 31:09.128
Someone really doesn't want
anybody watching it.

31:09.171 --> 31:10.085
You could break through
that kind of encryption, though,

31:10.129 --> 31:11.826
right, Riley?

31:11.870 --> 31:13.001
Of course I can.

31:13.045 --> 31:15.003
But that doesn't mean we should.

31:15.047 --> 31:17.179
Look, of course I want to
know what's on Dragonfly,

31:17.223 --> 31:20.313
but if Matty wants
to keep it to herself,

31:20.356 --> 31:21.618
shouldn't we let her

31:21.662 --> 31:23.925
Agreed.

31:23.969 --> 31:26.319
Good news, Abina.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.974
You've been booked on a flight
to Los Angeles. Congratulations.

31:30.236 --> 31:31.280
Matty came through.

31:31.324 --> 31:32.586
Like she always does.

31:32.629 --> 31:34.370
Now, we can discuss
this on the plane,

31:34.414 --> 31:35.850
but right now we should
get to the airport

31:35.894 --> 31:37.504
before soldiers start
shutting everything down. Yeah?

31:37.547 --> 31:39.114
Yeah, good plan.

31:39.158 --> 31:41.334
Hey, how's about I drive
this time, Furiosa?

31:41.377 --> 31:43.902
If you insist.Yeah.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.991
DANSO:
Abina.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.688
A

31:47.731 --> 31:49.211
Danso?I need your help.

31:49.255 --> 31:51.692
Danso, what's wrong?Please.

31:53.085 --> 31:56.262
JOSEPH:
I gave you a place to live.

31:56.305 --> 31:57.741
A way to earn money.

31:57.785 --> 31:59.047
And how did you thank me?

31:59.091 --> 32:02.311
Huh? By helping people steal
from me.

32:04.357 --> 32:05.793
Now here's what's going
to happen next.

32:05.836 --> 32:07.534
You bring me that hard drive,

32:07.577 --> 32:09.710
and whatever's on it
that I overlooked,

32:09.753 --> 32:11.930
or I start hurting your friends.

32:11.973 --> 32:15.934
And we both know that I can
always find more scavengers, eh?

32:17.544 --> 32:19.763
You have 30 minutes...

32:19.807 --> 32:21.069
or I start with Danso.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.300
RILEY:
All right, I'm counting four,

32:34.343 --> 32:36.693
maybe five of his men
by the hostages.

32:36.737 --> 32:38.695
Bozer, any chance you
could focus on that thing?

32:38.739 --> 32:40.393
Doing the best I can, Riley.

32:40.436 --> 32:42.961
Not exactly working with
Panavision precision here.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.701
Okay.

32:44.745 --> 32:46.181
Junkyard Joe's got

32:46.225 --> 32:48.444
three two-man teams patrolling
the yard looking for us.

32:49.837 --> 32:52.013
JACK: Yeah, make that
four two-man teams, Boze.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.188
They're everywhere.

32:53.232 --> 32:54.450
JACK:
I wish we could just shoot them.

32:54.494 --> 32:56.191
All right, I think I can

32:56.235 --> 32:59.325
carve a path
through the patrolling guards,

32:59.368 --> 33:01.196
get us close enough
to Joseph, but...

33:01.240 --> 33:03.894
even if I do,
we still got a problem:

33:03.938 --> 33:05.244
the stationary guards.

33:05.287 --> 33:08.334
Unless I can knock all them out
at the same time,

33:08.377 --> 33:09.988
we still got a problem.

33:10.031 --> 33:12.816
We can't. The moment we move on
them, someone could get hurt,

33:12.860 --> 33:14.079
or worse.

33:14.122 --> 33:15.994
We need to separate the kids
from the guards.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.169
Yeah, agree,

33:17.212 --> 33:18.213
but how?Signal the kids

33:18.257 --> 33:19.998
without Joseph's men knowing.

33:24.741 --> 33:26.787
How are we gonna
signal the kids

33:26.830 --> 33:28.223
without getting Joseph's...What's the main difference

33:28.267 --> 33:30.878
between the hostages
and the men guarding them?

33:30.921 --> 33:32.358
Okay, Mac, you're doing that
annoying thing your dad does

33:32.401 --> 33:33.707
where you ask a
question instead of...

33:33.750 --> 33:35.578
Age. The hostages
are much younger

33:35.622 --> 33:37.319
than the men guarding them.
We can use this.

33:41.802 --> 33:43.369
People's ability to hear
high frequencies degrades

33:43.412 --> 33:45.893
as they age, so a five-year-old
can hear higher frequencies

33:45.936 --> 33:47.286
than a 20-year-old,

33:47.329 --> 33:51.159
who can hear higher frequencies
than a 40-year-old.

33:51.203 --> 33:52.769
You just have to calibrate
the frequency.

33:53.901 --> 33:55.468
You guys hear that?Yeah.

33:55.511 --> 33:56.817
Mm-hmm.

34:01.996 --> 34:04.346
How about now?I can still hear it.

34:04.390 --> 34:06.566
Right, because you're younger;
we're older, we can't hear it.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.394
Which should work on a guard.

34:08.437 --> 34:10.135
Wow.Abina, I need you

34:10.178 --> 34:12.093
to record a message
to your friends,

34:12.137 --> 34:14.182
telling them to run

34:14.226 --> 34:15.662
when they hear the whistle.

34:15.705 --> 34:18.099
Fast.

34:35.073 --> 34:37.597
It's working.
The kids can hear

34:37.640 --> 34:40.861
Abina's recording, but the
guards are totally oblivious.

34:51.872 --> 34:53.091
Joseph.

34:57.443 --> 34:59.140
I brought you what you want.

34:59.184 --> 35:01.534
Now let them go.

35:02.883 --> 35:06.713
Where are your new friends?

35:08.367 --> 35:09.716
They left.

35:11.152 --> 35:12.980
Without the drive
that was so important to them

35:13.023 --> 35:16.549
that they came all the way
to Ghana to retrieve?

35:16.592 --> 35:19.465
I swapped it out for a decoy
before I ditched them.

35:24.731 --> 35:27.299
Maybe the 12 of you will
survive after all, huh?

35:31.564 --> 35:33.870
Give me the drive.

35:33.914 --> 35:36.656
I'll give it you.

35:36.699 --> 35:40.050
Only after you let them go.

35:50.713 --> 35:53.542
You are in no position
to make any demands, Abina.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.196
Actually, I am.

36:11.647 --> 36:13.127
JACK:
Okay, Mac. Perimeter's clean.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.912
Get your battery bombs ready.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.218
You're clear to the hostages.

36:17.262 --> 36:18.785
Whatever's on this drive
must be very valuable...

36:18.828 --> 36:21.570
Enough!

36:24.486 --> 36:25.661
Mac, it's time.

36:25.705 --> 36:27.054
MAC:
Riley, give them the signal.

36:27.097 --> 36:28.838
Give me the drive, now.

36:46.421 --> 36:48.206
Don't move.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.991
I told you.

37:03.786 --> 37:06.136
We did it.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.138
We sure did.

37:10.053 --> 37:11.577
MATTY:
I'm happy to report

37:11.620 --> 37:15.058
that not only is Joseph Musah's
entire operation

37:15.102 --> 37:16.538
being ripped out by the roots,

37:16.582 --> 37:19.149
but the corrupt Ghanaian
soldiers that were helping him

37:19.193 --> 37:20.499
have already started
turning on each other.

37:20.542 --> 37:22.152
Ah, that's great news.

37:22.196 --> 37:23.545
You can also tell Abina

37:23.589 --> 37:25.330
that she's booked
on the next flight back to L.A.

37:25.373 --> 37:27.984
And I was able to secure her
temporary housing

37:28.028 --> 37:30.422
while we sort out her situation.

37:31.553 --> 37:32.815
Matty, I don't know
how you did that,

37:32.859 --> 37:35.818
but thank you.Yeah, thanks, Matty.

37:35.862 --> 37:39.431
You can thank me by getting
that drive back to the Phoenix.

37:39.474 --> 37:42.085
Pronto.Yes, ma'am.

37:42.129 --> 37:43.435
Hey, Mac.

37:43.478 --> 37:45.915
I thought about what you said
earlier and realized

37:45.959 --> 37:47.613
you were right.

37:47.656 --> 37:49.223
Matty always
has our backs.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.529
We should have hers.

37:50.572 --> 37:52.705
If she wants to keep
Dragonfly a secret,

37:52.748 --> 37:54.881
then that's her right.

37:54.924 --> 37:56.926
RILEY:
Yeah, I agree.

37:58.537 --> 38:00.626
Works for me. Let's go home.

38:07.937 --> 38:11.463
Abina. We got to get going
if you want to make the flight.

38:11.506 --> 38:13.943
I'm not coming.

38:16.729 --> 38:18.644
Why?I'm sorry.

38:18.687 --> 38:21.777
I can't abandon them. They need
somebody honest to lead them,

38:21.821 --> 38:23.953
or another Joseph
will come in and take over.

38:23.997 --> 38:26.739
They need me.

38:27.783 --> 38:29.045
A
Where are you gonna live?

38:29.089 --> 38:32.310
We'll figure something out.
We always do.

38:35.313 --> 38:39.229
Yeah, that's just
not gonna work for me.

38:57.160 --> 39:00.163
I know you don't know
why you went to Ghana.

39:02.731 --> 39:04.429
But I'm so grateful
that you did.

39:05.691 --> 39:07.083
Thank you for this.

39:07.127 --> 39:09.390
Cards on the table, Matty,
I seriously considered

39:09.434 --> 39:11.218
looking at Dragonfly.

39:11.261 --> 39:12.872
I was really
curious-- still am,

39:12.915 --> 39:16.354
to be honest--
but none of us looked.

39:19.095 --> 39:20.140
You deserve that.

39:20.183 --> 39:22.577
I appreciate
your honesty, Bozer.

39:22.621 --> 39:24.057
Now,

39:24.100 --> 39:26.059
who's ready for more good news?

39:26.102 --> 39:27.234
Oh, I think we all are.

39:27.277 --> 39:28.191
Matty, come on, now.

39:28.235 --> 39:29.932
Don't-don't leave us hanging.

39:29.976 --> 39:33.936
Actually, I'm gonna let someone
very special show you herself.

39:33.980 --> 39:36.069
Hi, Riley, hi, everyone.

39:36.112 --> 39:38.724
You won't believe
what's happening here.

39:38.767 --> 39:42.336
Phoenix just partnered
with a non-profit

39:42.380 --> 39:45.948
to build Abina and her friends
new prefabricated homes

39:45.992 --> 39:48.124
near the landfill,
ensuring that she'll be working

39:48.168 --> 39:50.083
in the safest environment
possible.

39:51.171 --> 39:53.869
We're so excited. Thank you.

39:55.305 --> 39:56.524
Thank you so much.

39:56.568 --> 39:59.266
Hope to see you guys again soon.

40:12.148 --> 40:14.150
♪

40:45.312 --> 40:48.446
My name is Ethan Reigns.
Born February 11, 1974.

40:48.489 --> 40:51.361
As you can see,
I'm standing in an office

40:51.405 --> 40:54.060
at CIA headquarters
in Washington, D.C.

40:54.103 --> 40:57.193
Today's date is August 6, 2010.

40:57.237 --> 41:01.328
I'm making this video because
tomorrow I start deep cover,

41:01.371 --> 41:04.636
and I need
my true identity on record

41:04.679 --> 41:08.291
in case something ever happens
to any the few people

41:08.335 --> 41:10.859
who are read-in
on my assignment,

41:10.903 --> 41:13.383
codenamed Dragonfly.

41:20.434 --> 41:22.262
Matty...

41:22.305 --> 41:25.874
I want you to know that this

41:25.918 --> 41:28.790
is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

41:30.879 --> 41:32.794
I'm so sorry.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.501
I love you.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.508
I love you, too.
