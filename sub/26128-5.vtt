00:45.379 --> 00:46.630
Falling in love

00:46.756 --> 00:48.007
It's too painful.

01:00.436 --> 01:01.854
Yeah, and what's

01:02.021 --> 01:04.273

a new lesbian,

10:11.236 --> 10:12.654
but I think I can be
pretty good at it.

10:12.821 --> 10:16.241
Sorry, you sound like Jasmine.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.117
Who's that?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.577
My second grade girlfriend,

10:19.161 --> 10:22.164
until I found out
she was playing doctor

10:22.331 --> 10:24.041
with Ricardo Jimenez
at naptime.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.793
- What a bitch.
- Mm-hmm.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.920
Not as bad
as Shawnte Watson, though.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.505
She would only
closed-mouth kiss me

10:30.672 --> 10:32.424
while she would tongue-kiss
boys behind my back.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.509
Damn.
Third grade girlfriend?

10:35.010 --> 10:36.219
Second grade still.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.722
No, third grade was, uh,
Ronnie Carson.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.141
<i>She would, uh,
tell her mom</i>

10:41.308 --> 10:42.809
<i>we were getting married.</i>

10:43.477 --> 10:45.646
<i>Your body
is rejecting your liver.</i>

10:45.812 --> 10:47.481
I've been taking
my medication.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.232
You've been on AssimiPro
since your transplant.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.400
After about five years,

10:50.567 --> 10:52.361
it can tend to lose
its efficacy.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.863
I'm going to switch you
to Hepatocycline.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.990
Top of the line,
just approved by the FDA.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.909
Pretty much
zero side effects.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.578
We'll start you on a megadose
and an IV right now,

11:01.745 --> 11:03.413
and then we'll send you home
with some pills.

11:03.622 --> 11:04.915
How much does that cost?

11:05.082 --> 11:06.500
With insurance,
maybe 20 bucks a month.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.751
No insurance.

11:08.043 --> 11:08.877
You don't have insurance?

11:09.044 --> 11:10.337
Correct.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.090
Eh, then you're looking
at two grand a month.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.925
- What? A month?
- Jesus.

11:15.092 --> 11:17.177
You could do the generic,
Hepazone C--

11:17.344 --> 11:18.470
been around
since the '70s.

11:18.679 --> 11:19.680
How much is that?

11:19.846 --> 11:21.306
Around 30 bucks a month.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.017
Great, start me
with a megadose of that,

11:24.184 --> 11:26.687
throw in some Vicodin,
and my interracial friends

11:26.853 --> 11:28.105
and myself will be on our way.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.357
I need to go over
the side effects with you

11:30.524 --> 11:32.651
before you decide
that Hepazone is right for you.

11:32.818 --> 11:35.737
I never met a drug
I didn't like, but hit me.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.656
Here we go.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.533
- Sporadic blindness...
<i>- Blindness?</i>

11:39.741 --> 11:40.826
...paralysis of the face...

11:40.992 --> 11:41.743
Wow.

11:41.910 --> 11:42.703
<i>...skin rashes,</i>

11:42.869 --> 11:44.871
<i>joint pain,
hair loss,</i>

11:45.038 --> 11:47.332
gout, insomnia,
mouth ulcers,

11:47.666 --> 11:49.918
halitosis,
degeneration of the gums,

11:50.085 --> 11:51.044
<i>testicular soreness,</i>

11:51.211 --> 11:53.088
severely heightened
emotional sensitivity...

11:54.297 --> 11:56.216
...and erectile dysfunction.

11:56.591 --> 11:57.634
His willy won't work?

11:57.968 --> 11:59.344
It's possible.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.304
Oh, no worries, Doc.

12:01.513 --> 12:04.391
No way my member
won't march.

12:04.641 --> 12:05.892
I'll take the generic.

12:16.528 --> 12:17.362
Right, thanks for the ride.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.488
Sure.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.579
Where you going?

12:25.746 --> 12:27.289
I got a couple minutes
before I gotta be at work.

12:27.456 --> 12:29.458
Ha, no way.
Absolutely not.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.168
I'm not gonna
even say anything.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.878
I'm just gonna listen.

12:33.086 --> 12:33.962
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

12:34.129 --> 12:35.547
He is pleading insanity.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.674
- End of story.
- If he admits he's bipolar,

12:37.841 --> 12:40.302
suddenly our entire movement
is about mental illness.

12:40.469 --> 12:42.471
<i>So you want him to go
to prison for ten years?</i>

12:42.637 --> 12:44.097
He'll get less
if he pleads guilty.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.265
- Excuse me.
<i>- And even less</i>

12:45.474 --> 12:46.600
if he pleads insanity.

12:46.767 --> 12:47.559
Hey!

12:49.853 --> 12:52.230
Does anyone wanna hear
what my lawyer has to say?

12:54.566 --> 12:56.276
Look, I know this judge.

12:56.818 --> 12:57.778
- He understands--
- Excuse me.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.237
If you make him
plead insanity,

12:59.404 --> 13:00.822
you are putting lives
at risk.

13:00.989 --> 13:03.074
Kids all over the world
say Ian saved them.

13:03.241 --> 13:04.993
He put his time in.
Now you save 'em.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.536
They don't want
Gay Mary Magdalene.

13:06.703 --> 13:07.621
They want gay Jesus.

13:07.788 --> 13:08.705
Well, they can't
have him.

13:08.872 --> 13:09.748
<i>He belongs to his family.</i>

13:09.915 --> 13:11.416
<i>This is bigger
than family.</i>

13:11.583 --> 13:13.585
Nothing is bigger than family,

13:13.752 --> 13:16.588
and if you send my brother
to prison for one second

13:17.005 --> 13:18.840
longer than he needs
to be there,

13:19.007 --> 13:22.677
I'm gonna torch a van
with your pixie ass in it.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.308
Oh, fuck.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.037
What can I get for you?

15:14.664 --> 15:15.415
Um,

15:15.874 --> 15:17.542
let me get a pack of Camels.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.086
Um...
you know what?

15:20.253 --> 15:22.589
Let me get a pack
of American Spirits too.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.300
Uh, some Marlboros.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.552
Some, uh--some Winstons.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.846
You know, throw some,
uh, Dunhills in there

15:30.013 --> 15:31.598
and Pall Malls.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.184
I'm thinking
of changing brands.

15:40.732 --> 15:41.733
Thank you.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.612
Are all lesbians
that dramatic?

15:46.613 --> 15:47.322
Where are you going?

15:47.489 --> 15:49.032
- Leave me alone, Fiona.
- Ian--

15:49.199 --> 15:50.951
Stay out of it!

15:59.000 --> 16:00.168
<i>So I think I'm gonna</i>

16:00.335 --> 16:01.795
<i>start my speech off
with a joke.</i>

16:01.962 --> 16:03.088
<i>Needing a man
to speak for women,</i>

16:03.254 --> 16:04.089
<i>that's the joke.</i>

16:04.255 --> 16:06.383
Giving us meds
that stop working

16:06.549 --> 16:08.426
and then pricing us out
of the ones that do,

16:08.593 --> 16:10.387
- that's the joke.
- Oh, here we go.

16:10.553 --> 16:11.471
<i>Did you hear
that doctor?</i>

16:11.638 --> 16:12.722
She didn't even
wanna tell me

16:12.889 --> 16:14.599
about the generic drug.

16:14.766 --> 16:18.144
Well, just like the great
slaves of the South...

16:18.311 --> 16:19.229
- Oh, don't do that, man.
- All right, Frank,

16:19.354 --> 16:20.814
you need to stop right there.
That's enough.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.148
...decades of forced labor

16:22.315 --> 16:23.733
in the fields
have left us

16:23.942 --> 16:25.735
- Kunta Kinte strong.
<i>- Frank.</i>

16:25.902 --> 16:28.321
<i>Gonna take more
than a few side effects</i>

16:28.530 --> 16:30.198
to break our spirits.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.742
Swing low, sweet chariot.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.790
It's time for the field hands

16:39.124 --> 16:40.333
to rise.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.669
- I'm about to fuck you up.
- Wait, wait, wait, stop.

16:42.836 --> 16:43.920
<i>What are you doing?</i>

16:44.087 --> 16:46.673
What the fuck are you do--
Get your ass out of my face!

16:46.840 --> 16:47.882
<i>Frank!</i>

16:49.551 --> 16:51.970

16:52.137 --> 16:54.681

16:55.974 --> 16:58.351

16:58.518 --> 17:00.103

17:02.105 --> 17:04.816

17:08.903 --> 17:11.114
I mean,
we're high school juniors,

17:11.281 --> 17:13.825
and she's still confused
about her sexuality?

17:13.992 --> 17:15.243
Enjoy your lunch,
you guys.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.912
I mean, how many times can
a heart get broken, you know?

17:20.957 --> 17:22.333
I can't talk right now,
Fiona.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.501
<i>Are you still
at Patsy's?</i>

17:23.668 --> 17:25.295
<i>Oh, never mind.
I see you.</i>

17:25.712 --> 17:26.713
What's going on?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.590
Ugh. My brother's
going to prison,

17:28.757 --> 17:30.633
and my sister's
losing her shit.

17:32.177 --> 17:34.137
Hi.
Hi.

17:34.345 --> 17:35.764
Alex.
She's cute.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.265
- Can I borrow her for a sec?
- Yeah.

17:37.432 --> 17:38.516
Come on.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.437
I think it's time
for an intervention.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.731
Why doesn't anyone accept
the fact that I'm gay?

17:44.939 --> 17:46.733
No, not you, Ian.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.068
That bitch Geneva
got in his head.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.236
I think he's considering
not taking a plea deal.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.696
- How do you know?
- I was there.

17:51.863 --> 17:53.073
You went into
his lawyer meeting?

17:53.239 --> 17:54.741
That-that's what
"I was there" means.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.409
Tell me you didn't
go all Fiona on him

17:56.576 --> 17:57.952
and tell him
what he's supposed to do.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.580
"Going Fiona" is not a thing.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.332
Trust me.
It's a thing.

18:02.791 --> 18:03.500
Where is he now?

18:03.666 --> 18:04.584
I don't know.
He took off.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.961
He's not answering
calls or texts.

18:08.213 --> 18:09.631
He's a grown man, Fiona.

18:09.798 --> 18:11.716
Sounds like he doesn't want
to talk to you.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.510
Might be time to let go.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.208
<i>Will you
be called to make sacrifices?</i>

18:45.458 --> 18:47.669
Yes, but the pride
you'll earn

18:47.836 --> 18:49.212
in service to this country

18:49.379 --> 18:51.798
<i>will outweigh the loss
you may sustain</i>

18:51.965 --> 18:54.759
at the hands
of our nation's foes.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.178
<i>Enjoy the food,</i>

18:57.470 --> 18:58.847
and with any luck,

18:59.180 --> 19:02.308
we'll be buried side by side
at Arlington one day.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.026
Want a little spice
in your punch?

19:12.193 --> 19:13.111
What?

19:14.112 --> 19:15.363
Absinthe.

19:15.530 --> 19:16.531
Sure.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.495
- I'm Kelly.
- Carl.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.205
Are you a candidate
for West Point?

19:24.372 --> 19:26.541
Am I one of these pussies?
No.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.376
Annapolis-bound,
much to the chagrin

19:28.543 --> 19:30.003
of Old Iron Legs there.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.379
Major Keefe?

19:31.546 --> 19:32.922
He's my dad.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.507
Is that a clip-on tie?

19:34.674 --> 19:36.926
Uh, yeah. I don't know
how to tie a real one.

19:37.552 --> 19:38.928
No shit.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.723
- Well, that's interesting.
<i>- Kelly.</i>

19:42.098 --> 19:42.765
Hi.

19:42.932 --> 19:43.850
Hi.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.101
What's your name?

19:45.268 --> 19:46.811
Jackson Ehrenreich.

19:46.978 --> 19:49.397
We met at the cotillion,

19:49.647 --> 19:51.149
fooled around a bit
in the coat check.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.779
My dick sort of...
bent hard to the left.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.656
Yikes.

19:59.032 --> 19:59.908
Jacob, was it?

20:00.116 --> 20:01.075
Jackson.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.118
- Ehrenreich.
- Right.

20:02.285 --> 20:03.494
That's a different Kelly.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.330
I think I saw her
in the map room earlier.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.624
Straight down that way,
then a hard to the left.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.294
Douchebag.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.421
I was barely conscious.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.966
Let's go sample Daddy Dearest's
scotch collection.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.928
<i>And I'm proud
to defend you women</i>

20:20.094 --> 20:21.554
and all the women of Chicago

20:21.721 --> 20:24.057
against the scourge
on society

20:24.224 --> 20:25.975
<i>that is the clueless man.</i>

20:26.142 --> 20:28.144
#TimesUp, my sisters.

20:28.311 --> 20:31.231
Oh, and #MeToo.
What do you think?

20:31.648 --> 20:32.732
<i>You hard, Kermit?</i>

20:32.899 --> 20:34.067
Yup.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.069
- Tommy?
- Oh, yeah.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.570
Great.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.948
You two assholes have stiffies,

20:40.156 --> 20:41.699
and little Frank is turtling.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.201
Maybe that's 'cause
you're watching porn

20:43.368 --> 20:46.246
with Kermit and Tommy.
The usual, Libby?

20:46.412 --> 20:48.081
- It's a workday, ain't it?
<i>- Turn that porn off.</i>

20:48.248 --> 20:50.625
We're gonna have to lower
our own Vagina Safe rating.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.669
Are my eyelids moving?

20:52.835 --> 20:55.463
I think my face is paralyzed.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.425
Did you just gargle
with rubbing alcohol?

20:59.968 --> 21:01.594
Yeah. If you had
the dick in your mouth

21:01.761 --> 21:03.846
that I just had in mine,
you would too.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.724
Hey, Libby...

21:06.891 --> 21:07.850
I'm off-duty.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.603
Pay off-duty rates.

21:13.398 --> 21:14.565
Let's get this over with.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.741
Coming.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.702
Hi, Mr. Milkovich.

21:25.868 --> 21:28.371
Mickey's in Mexico.
Fuck off, rectum boy.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.539
I'm not here
to see Mickey.

21:29.664 --> 21:30.581
I'm here to see you.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.500
What, you trying to faggify
all of us?

21:32.667 --> 21:34.836
You don't faggify people.
That's not how--

21:35.128 --> 21:36.504
how much time'd you do
in the pen?

21:37.338 --> 21:38.798
Eighteen years, on and off.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.008
How bad was it?

21:40.174 --> 21:42.093
Depends on your definition
of bad.

21:42.260 --> 21:45.054
Mouth-and ass-rapings--
which you'd probably enjoy--

21:45.221 --> 21:46.848
beatings by the guards,
food sucked--

21:47.015 --> 21:48.182
You were mouth-
and ass-raped?

21:48.349 --> 21:49.809
You kidding?
I did the raping.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.477
Milkoviches don't bottom.

21:51.769 --> 21:52.854
Was Mickey adopted?

21:53.604 --> 21:54.689
Fuck off, Gallagher.

21:54.856 --> 21:56.566
Okay, rapings...

21:56.774 --> 21:58.276
food, guards--
I can handle that shit.

21:58.484 --> 21:59.235
I just need to know if--

21:59.402 --> 22:01.529
Anyone can handle
that shit.

22:01.904 --> 22:03.823
It's the boredom
that'll kill you.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.242
Starts out, you're figuring out
your surroundings.

22:06.451 --> 22:08.119
Then the day-to-day
sets in.

22:08.286 --> 22:10.038
Start reading books,
lifting weights,

22:10.204 --> 22:12.623
fuck a few of the pussy boys
in the yard,

22:12.790 --> 22:14.917
but you're in the same place
with the same assholes,

22:15.084 --> 22:17.337
doing the same shit
every second of every hour

22:17.503 --> 22:20.340
of every day
of every goddamned year.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.594
I was you,
I'd pack my shit and run.

22:33.561 --> 22:34.771
Hi, Satchel Boy.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.064
What do you want, Sissy?

22:36.230 --> 22:37.440
Just wondering
how your day was.

22:37.648 --> 22:38.900
Todd?

22:39.817 --> 22:40.818
Todd?

22:41.527 --> 22:42.278
Shut up!

22:43.071 --> 22:44.989
I'm just-just trying
to be friendly.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.159
My day was fine.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.119
Good, good.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.049
♪♪ Oh-oh, oh-oh... ♪♪

23:03.216 --> 23:04.634
Don't-don't stop.

23:04.759 --> 23:06.761
I'm starting to feel something.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.555
Ugh, fuck this.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.808
I gotta stop.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.017
Why?

23:14.143 --> 23:15.603
Because my neck
is killing me,

23:15.812 --> 23:18.773
my-my knees are hurting...

23:22.568 --> 23:23.444
God.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.863
Just give me a few minutes.
We'll go again.

23:26.030 --> 23:29.951
No, it's a side effect
of my liver meds.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.286
Damn.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.122
It's generic.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.417
I can't afford
the brand name.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.961
Here.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.004
No, no, no. I-I--
You keep it.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.464
I didn't get the job done.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.425
No, take it.

24:08.614 --> 24:09.782
Wanna have sex?

24:09.949 --> 24:10.992
Easy answer, yes,

24:11.159 --> 24:13.995
but Kev made me sign
some form that I wouldn't

24:14.162 --> 24:16.539
fuck anyone who's too drunk
to provide consent.

24:16.706 --> 24:17.457
Who's Kev?

24:17.623 --> 24:18.958
He's the Vagina Safe guy.

24:19.709 --> 24:23.921
Tell Kev I can keep
my own vagina safe.

24:35.057 --> 24:36.142
Kelly?

24:38.936 --> 24:40.271
Was that a yes?

24:42.023 --> 24:43.566
Ian?

24:46.736 --> 24:47.820
Ian!

25:15.389 --> 25:17.808
Fuck me.

25:18.017 --> 25:18.976
Ian?

25:22.063 --> 25:23.064
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

25:23.231 --> 25:24.148
<i>I've been texting you.</i>

25:24.315 --> 25:25.525
Oh, there's a power outage
at work.

25:25.691 --> 25:26.651
I went for a run.
What's up?

25:26.817 --> 25:27.777
We gotta go find Ian.

25:28.194 --> 25:31.030
He jumped bail. I think he's
skipping out on his hearing.

25:31.906 --> 25:32.615
How do you figure?

25:32.782 --> 25:34.575
He dyed his hair
and his drawers are empty.

25:34.784 --> 25:36.994
Bus station or train station?
Which one you want?

25:37.537 --> 25:40.623
Uh...neither.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.416
Sounds like he doesn't want
to be found.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.669
<i>I don't care
if he wants to be found.</i>

25:44.877 --> 25:46.754
He's a fugitive,
and he's our brother.

25:46.921 --> 25:48.965
He gets caught like this,
he's gonna get sent away

25:49.131 --> 25:50.925
for way longer than ten years.

25:51.467 --> 25:52.718
You're okay
with him risking that?

25:52.885 --> 25:54.095
No, I'm not okay with that,

25:54.262 --> 25:55.930
but it's not up to me.

25:56.097 --> 25:57.557
<i>He's an adult.
He made a decision.</i>

25:57.723 --> 25:59.100
It's the wrong decision.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.310
Did you go all Fiona on him?

26:01.852 --> 26:03.104
That is not a thing.

26:03.271 --> 26:05.314
Look, if you push someone
too hard in one direction,

26:05.481 --> 26:06.857
they're just gonna run
three times faster

26:07.024 --> 26:09.694
- in the other direction.
- Or you can shove them so hard

26:09.860 --> 26:11.696
in the right direction
that they do what's right.

26:11.862 --> 26:13.990
That's why it's called
the right direction.

26:14.156 --> 26:16.200
So bus station
or train station?

26:16.367 --> 26:17.076
Neither.

26:18.953 --> 26:19.829
Fine.

26:28.129 --> 26:30.423
And I think that, like,
make sure we're stapling them

26:30.590 --> 26:31.799
<i>really tight, 'cause remember
at the last rally</i>

26:31.966 --> 26:33.759
<i>when they all fell off?
Yeah.</i>

26:33.926 --> 26:35.761
<i>No, that's how we learned
to not use glue.</i>

26:35.928 --> 26:37.972
<i>Okay, this is all looking
really, really good.</i>

26:38.180 --> 26:39.307
<i>Make sure that
we're stapling it on...</i>

26:39.557 --> 26:41.976
Oh, uh, everyone
not speaking at the march,

26:42.143 --> 26:43.269
take a break.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.146
We need the room
for rehearsal.

26:46.314 --> 26:50.693
Women, I would like to welcome
our newest speaker, Kevin Ball,

26:50.860 --> 26:52.111
<i>and his partner, Veronica.</i>

26:52.278 --> 26:53.988
- Welcome, guys. Hi.
- Hello.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.489
<i>Uh, Kevin,
glad to have</i>

26:55.656 --> 26:58.451
a man on board who understands
the dangers we women face.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.745
Honored to be a part
of the sisterhood.

27:01.996 --> 27:03.039
<i>Now, uh,</i>

27:03.205 --> 27:04.498
audiences at these marches

27:04.665 --> 27:06.167
have zero attention span,

27:06.334 --> 27:08.711
so we've gotta keep
this ship moving.

27:09.170 --> 27:11.255
Let's run a cue-to-cue.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.215
Uh, order's right there.
Stage one.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.259
Each of you stand,
give the first

27:15.426 --> 27:16.761
and last lines
of your speech

27:16.927 --> 27:19.972
so the next person knows
when it's her--or his--

27:20.348 --> 27:21.349
<i>turn to speak.</i>

27:21.557 --> 27:23.392
Charisma,
what's your first line?

27:27.104 --> 27:28.689
Twelve years ago,
I was gang-raped

27:28.856 --> 27:29.774
<i>in a bathroom</i>

27:29.982 --> 27:32.777
<i>near the level two
east concession stand.</i>

27:32.943 --> 27:33.903
<i>And last line.</i>

27:34.445 --> 27:35.863
With my family's support,

27:36.072 --> 27:39.033
I can finally get out of bed
during football season.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.536
Applause, applause, applause.
Loyola, that's your cue.

27:42.703 --> 27:46.082
Uh, when I was 16, I woke up
in an alley on my birthday.

27:46.248 --> 27:48.417
Blah, blah, blah.

27:50.211 --> 27:51.754
I'm a stronger woman now,

27:51.921 --> 27:53.756
and I can finally defecate
pain-free.

27:54.507 --> 27:57.259
I got my first abortion
when I was 14.

27:57.426 --> 28:00.179
I was sex-trafficked
at the age of six.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.556
<i>I was 13
when I was circumcised.</i>

28:02.723 --> 28:04.684
I just want my clitoris back.

28:04.892 --> 28:05.976
Fuck men.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.104
Fuck 'em up the ass.

28:08.646 --> 28:09.689
Fuck all of them.

28:11.232 --> 28:12.692
<i>So, Kevin,
when you hear,</i>

28:12.858 --> 28:15.027
"Fuck men. Fuck them up
the ass. Fuck all of them,"

28:15.194 --> 28:16.404
<i>that's when you go.</i>

28:22.284 --> 28:24.578
Okay, 3:30 group,
you can go in now.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.456
Sir, I'm sorry.

28:27.581 --> 28:29.542
Everyone in this group
has to go in now.

28:29.709 --> 28:30.918
I'm just waiting
for someone.

28:31.127 --> 28:33.045
Is there any way
we can go in the next group?

28:33.254 --> 28:36.257
It's now or never.
Sorry.

28:38.551 --> 28:40.052

be in here?

29:55.961 --> 29:57.046
I need to wash my junk.

29:57.213 --> 29:58.255
<i>What, like now?</i>

29:58.380 --> 29:59.673
Like ten minutes ago.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.550
I think I had sex
with a trashy girl.

30:01.717 --> 30:02.802
What do you mean you think?

30:02.968 --> 30:04.845
Uh, it was dark.
Couldn't tell.

30:05.054 --> 30:06.263
How trashy we talking?

30:06.806 --> 30:08.474
Pretty trashy.

30:08.933 --> 30:10.601
Should've heard
these women's stories.

30:10.768 --> 30:12.603
Rapes, beatings--
I had no idea.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.104
If you had no idea,
you've been

30:14.271 --> 30:15.731
walking around
with blinders on.

30:15.898 --> 30:17.066
Do you know
how many times a day

30:17.233 --> 30:19.068
a guy touches me
inappropriately?

30:19.235 --> 30:21.153
Hell, some asshole
on the L yesterday

30:21.320 --> 30:22.696
stuck his nose
in my cooch,

30:22.863 --> 30:24.490
- said he lost his balance.
- What?

30:24.657 --> 30:25.741
<i>Yeah.
A guy pulled</i>

30:25.908 --> 30:27.785
my dress off my shoulder
at a club Saturday.

30:27.952 --> 30:28.911
Licked my nipple.

30:29.078 --> 30:30.538
Never seen him before
in my life.

30:30.913 --> 30:32.248
- Jesus.
<i>- I won't get</i>

30:32.414 --> 30:34.208
on an escalator
if I'm wearing a skirt.

30:34.375 --> 30:35.668
I wear a wedding ring
everywhere

30:35.835 --> 30:37.336
to keep the assholes
from bothering me.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.547
All right, we get it.
Christ.

30:40.422 --> 30:41.423
I'm sorry.

30:41.590 --> 30:44.385
Is this stuff
making you boys uncomfortable?

30:44.593 --> 30:45.803
Welcome to womanhood.

30:51.267 --> 30:52.059
What the hell is this?

30:52.226 --> 30:53.435
My phone?

30:53.561 --> 30:55.104
Did you film yourself
fucking me

30:55.229 --> 30:56.188
while I was passed out?

30:56.355 --> 30:58.357
I filmed myself
not fucking you as proof.

30:58.524 --> 30:59.483
Proof of what?

30:59.650 --> 31:00.359
Not fucking you.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.278
You lying piece of shit!

31:04.905 --> 31:06.198
Why didn't you just
leave me here?

31:06.365 --> 31:07.616
I didn't want you
to choke on your own puke.

31:07.741 --> 31:09.827
Bullshit!

31:10.035 --> 31:11.370
You're just like

31:11.537 --> 31:13.539
those rich pricks downstairs
who think girls

31:13.706 --> 31:15.040
are their personal fuck toys.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.168
Your clip-on tie
is gonna hurt way worse

31:18.335 --> 31:21.171
than a real one
when I shove it 12--ah!

31:28.637 --> 31:29.471
♪♪ Ah ♪♪

31:38.355 --> 31:39.648
<i>What's going on?</i>

31:47.615 --> 31:50.200
♪♪ Ooh-ah ♪♪

32:18.145 --> 32:19.355
You got a knife?

32:28.322 --> 32:29.698
What are you doing?

32:30.199 --> 32:31.867
Electroshock therapy.

32:31.992 --> 32:33.243
I saw it on TV.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.287
It works.
There are studies.

32:36.413 --> 32:37.331
Come here.

32:40.209 --> 32:42.753
Rich people pay a lot of money
for expensive paddles.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.588
We're doing it
the Gallagher way.

32:48.509 --> 32:50.135
When I tell you,

32:50.260 --> 32:51.512
you plug that in.

32:51.679 --> 32:52.346
Wait.

32:52.513 --> 32:54.056
Wait, wait.

33:00.562 --> 33:01.438
Here.

33:02.147 --> 33:05.359
Put these on.
The rubber will protect you.

33:07.194 --> 33:08.153
And, uh,

33:09.029 --> 33:09.947
turn around.

33:10.406 --> 33:12.366
<i>No boy should see
his father like this.</i>

33:12.533 --> 33:14.326
Ready? Do it!

33:14.868 --> 33:15.577
Really?

33:15.744 --> 33:17.204
What, did I stutter?
I said--

33:27.881 --> 33:29.425
Should we start this thing?

33:30.426 --> 33:32.094
Well, is there anyone else
coming or...

33:32.511 --> 33:34.179
It's the afternoon.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.473
Maybe everyone's
stuck at work.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.934
Yeah, we're a bunch
of alcoholics.

33:39.101 --> 33:41.645
What's the likelihood of us all
holding down jobs?

33:42.229 --> 33:44.231
Shorter meeting
would be better anyway.

33:44.398 --> 33:45.983
<i>Need to get to a gig.</i>

33:46.150 --> 33:47.192
What do you do?

33:47.359 --> 33:48.736
I'm a sober companion.

33:48.902 --> 33:49.737
A what?

33:49.903 --> 33:51.822
I'm a babysitter for drunks.

33:51.947 --> 33:53.240
If an addict has something
coming up

33:53.407 --> 33:54.575
need to stay sober for,

33:55.034 --> 33:56.785
I keep them away
from the booze.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.245
They pay you?

33:58.412 --> 34:00.164
I'm getting 100 bucks
to keep some teacher dry

34:00.330 --> 34:01.623
before an annual review.

34:02.416 --> 34:03.500
I got five grand

34:03.667 --> 34:05.169
to keep
a prep school quarterback

34:05.335 --> 34:07.046
sober during
recruitment season.

34:10.424 --> 34:11.508
<i>Anyway,</i>

34:11.675 --> 34:13.969
should we review the steps
and get out of Dodge?

34:14.678 --> 34:16.138
Yeah, let's do it.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.352
<i>I swore, I swore,</i>

34:22.519 --> 34:24.980
I wouldn't take her back again,
and...

34:25.272 --> 34:27.232
<i>after I took her back
the third time--</i>

34:27.399 --> 34:28.734
- Debbie?
- Mm.

34:28.901 --> 34:30.027
Did you hear anything
I just said?

34:30.235 --> 34:31.111
Yeah.

34:31.987 --> 34:34.156
- No.
- Jesus!

34:34.323 --> 34:35.699
I'm sorry.

34:35.866 --> 34:37.951
We've just been sitting here
for eight hours.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.828
I don't like talking
about my feelings.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.706
It's called lesbianism, Debbie.
It's what we do.

34:43.165 --> 34:44.833
I thought sex with women
is what lesbians do.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.710
Yeah, and you're bad
at that too.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.631
So do you guys wanna hear
the dinner specials?

34:50.798 --> 34:52.966
No, we do not.
Thanks.

34:53.133 --> 34:54.051
Come on, Franny.

34:54.218 --> 34:55.761
Are you kidding me?

34:55.928 --> 34:57.721
I'm supposed to pay
for all this food

34:57.888 --> 34:59.264
<i>- we ate?</i>
- I don't know.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.390
Why don't you spend
the next eight hours

35:00.557 --> 35:01.391
talking it over with yourself

35:01.558 --> 35:02.810
and let me know
what you decide?

35:04.978 --> 35:06.355
You make me want cock again!

35:10.818 --> 35:11.693
Hi.

35:12.653 --> 35:14.113
How were the blueprints?

35:14.279 --> 35:15.364
I don't know.

35:15.489 --> 35:17.491
Couldn't see anything
through my blinding rage.

35:17.658 --> 35:19.660
I'm so sorry.
Ian went AWOL

35:19.827 --> 35:20.786
after his lawyer meeting, and--

35:20.953 --> 35:21.703
And?

35:21.870 --> 35:23.330
Well, I had
to go look for him.

35:23.497 --> 35:24.164
Why?

35:25.165 --> 35:25.999
What do you mean why?

35:26.166 --> 35:27.751
Because he's my brother.

35:27.918 --> 35:29.461
Your adult brother.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.338
He's not your
responsibility, Fiona.

35:31.505 --> 35:32.798
The only responsibility
you had today

35:32.965 --> 35:34.675
was to come
to an architecture exhibit

35:34.842 --> 35:36.969
that I bought tickets to
six months ago.

35:37.094 --> 35:38.720
That was your
responsibility.

35:38.887 --> 35:41.473
You're gonna lecture me
about responsibility,

35:41.640 --> 35:43.475
Mr. Lone Wolf,
"I never loved anything

35:43.684 --> 35:46.228
that didn't involve
reclaimed wood"?

35:46.353 --> 35:48.272
You don't have brothers
or sisters.

35:48.438 --> 35:50.524
You left your mother
in Ireland.

35:50.691 --> 35:52.818
You fathered children
all over the world

35:52.985 --> 35:55.946
that you seemingly feel
no obligation to take care of,

35:56.113 --> 35:57.281
so when in your life

35:57.447 --> 35:58.907
have you ever felt
responsibility

35:59.074 --> 36:00.159
- to anyone?
- Now.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.077
- Yeah, to who?
- To you.

36:05.581 --> 36:06.790
<i>You've got a few
first-degree burns</i>

36:06.999 --> 36:08.625
in your scrotal
and penile regions

36:08.792 --> 36:12.171
but no permanent damage
to the twig and/or berries.

36:12.588 --> 36:13.964
We're gonna keep you overnight,
just to monitor

36:14.131 --> 36:15.507
for any irregularities
in your heartbeat,

36:15.674 --> 36:17.050
but you should be able
to go home tomorrow.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.510
Thanks, Doctor.

36:18.719 --> 36:20.304
Thanks for nothing.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.974
My dick's not only soft.
It's charred.

36:24.141 --> 36:27.394
Looks like a Fourth of July
barbecue down there.

36:27.561 --> 36:29.062
You better get
your shit together, Frank.

36:29.229 --> 36:30.522
Kev and I are not
gonna spend our lives

36:30.689 --> 36:32.065
running you back and forth
to the hospital

36:32.191 --> 36:34.109
every time Liam calls--
not for your liver

36:34.276 --> 36:35.861
and definitely not
for your penis.

36:36.028 --> 36:39.239
Don't blame me.
Blame the aristocracy.

36:39.406 --> 36:42.409
Poor people have sex,
Veronica, a lot of it,

36:42.576 --> 36:44.620
because you know why?
It's free.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.788
You pay for movies.
You pay for beer...

36:46.955 --> 36:48.415
- You don't pay for beer.
- ..<i>.but if you're</i>

36:48.582 --> 36:50.459
a halfway decent-looking
person,

36:50.584 --> 36:51.501
you can get laid,

36:51.668 --> 36:53.003
but the aristocracy

36:53.170 --> 36:55.214
doesn't want poor people
getting laid

36:55.422 --> 36:58.050
<i>because that means
more poor people being born,</i>

36:58.217 --> 36:59.843
so they take our erections.

37:00.010 --> 37:02.429
They jack up the prices
of the drugs that work

37:02.596 --> 37:04.765
and push us into drugs
that steal our manhood.

37:04.973 --> 37:06.850
An erection does not
make a man.

37:07.059 --> 37:08.769
Making good choices
makes a man,

37:08.894 --> 37:09.937
<i>and right now,
you have to choose</i>

37:10.103 --> 37:11.855
between your penis
and your liver,

37:12.064 --> 37:13.732
and, Frank,
make the right choice.

37:15.943 --> 37:16.693
Come on, baby.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.755
Lesbianism fucking sucks.

37:37.881 --> 37:40.008
Why is there a lamp
on the floor?

37:43.345 --> 37:45.555
Women fucking suck.

37:47.516 --> 37:50.060
Why does it smell
like burnt human in here?

37:56.692 --> 37:58.110
Hi, Satchel Boy.

37:58.277 --> 37:59.444
<i>Sissy?</i>

38:00.320 --> 38:01.863
What are you doing here?

38:02.781 --> 38:04.157
Moving in.

38:04.908 --> 38:05.993
Um, why?

38:06.159 --> 38:06.910
<i>'Cause you need
to provide</i>

38:07.077 --> 38:08.412
<i>for your family, asshole.</i>

38:08.578 --> 38:09.830
<i>Why?</i>

38:11.748 --> 38:13.041
I'm pregnant.

38:21.717 --> 38:22.759
She doesn't even
look pregnant.

38:22.926 --> 38:24.219
Well, she took
a pregnancy test.

38:24.386 --> 38:25.637
She's definitely pregnant.

38:25.762 --> 38:27.681
And you guys are sure
you actually had sex?

38:28.307 --> 38:29.266
No.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.435
When did this happen?

38:31.601 --> 38:32.394
Today.

38:32.811 --> 38:33.478
Today?

38:33.645 --> 38:35.605
Then it can't
be yours, right?

38:36.064 --> 38:36.940
No.

38:37.107 --> 38:38.525
It's not yours, Liam.

38:38.692 --> 38:39.735
What should we do?

38:39.860 --> 38:40.777
Throw her out.

38:40.944 --> 38:41.987
She could be armed.

38:42.195 --> 38:43.488
She's definitely armed.

38:46.158 --> 38:48.785
<i>I say we wait
until Lip comes back.</i>

38:48.952 --> 38:50.203
- What are you doing now?
- I gotta get

38:50.370 --> 38:51.747
the rest of the dead dogs
out of the basement.

38:51.913 --> 38:53.540
Could you watch Franny for me?
I got stuff to do.

38:53.707 --> 38:55.667
- Lesbian stuff?
- Fuck off.

38:55.834 --> 38:56.877
And hey,
keep an eye on them.

38:57.044 --> 38:58.086

anymore.

- No. It'd be great, though.
- Jesus.

- Hmm?
- Don't.

48:34.412 --> 48:36.164

so she's calm for now.

just hit the red button

49:19.499 --> 49:20.458
Yes.

49:20.625 --> 49:22.251
You might send up
some Vicodin.

49:22.418 --> 49:23.836
She responds well to that.

49:24.003 --> 49:25.338
Okay, thank you.

49:27.840 --> 49:31.260
<i>Hey.
Looking for Vicodin?</i>

49:37.266 --> 49:38.643
Always.

49:56.077 --> 49:57.412

53:25.703 --> 53:27.747

53:27.914 --> 53:30.208
All right, Mr. Gallagher.
In the case

53:30.374 --> 53:32.418
of the state of Illinois
versus Ian Gallagher

53:32.627 --> 53:33.753
for the felony crime

53:33.920 --> 53:36.464
of arson,
how do you plead?

53:36.714 --> 53:37.465
<i>Your Honor,
a young man</i>

53:37.673 --> 53:39.091
<i>was being forced
into a van</i>

53:39.258 --> 53:40.134
against his will

53:40.301 --> 53:42.303
to be taken
to a conversion camp.

53:43.137 --> 53:45.139
His would-be captors
wanted to deny him

53:45.306 --> 53:47.767
of his true nature, and I
stopped that from happening,

53:47.934 --> 53:50.269
so I will not apologize
for that,

53:50.436 --> 53:52.438
<i>and the people
who were trying to change him</i>

53:52.605 --> 53:54.398
<i>were his family,
people who were supposed</i>

53:54.565 --> 53:55.858
<i>to love him
for who he was</i>

53:56.025 --> 53:58.694
unconditionally,
like my family...

53:58.861 --> 54:00.905
has loved me.

54:03.950 --> 54:05.701
And to not love--

54:06.827 --> 54:08.162
that is the true crime.

54:08.955 --> 54:11.207
<i>And at the end of the day,
everything I did,</i>

54:11.415 --> 54:12.583
<i>I did in the hopes</i>

54:12.750 --> 54:13.876
<i>that we would learn
to love each other</i>

54:14.043 --> 54:16.629
the way that Jesus taught
and God intended,

54:16.796 --> 54:20.424
<i>and, more importantly,
the-the way that we all need.</i>

54:20.758 --> 54:22.134
But I understand
there are laws,

54:23.594 --> 54:25.179
<i>and I broke one.</i>

54:25.346 --> 54:27.139
I set fire to a van,
and in doing so,

54:27.306 --> 54:30.184
I turned what I intended
to be a movement of love

54:30.810 --> 54:32.395
into a movement of anger.

54:35.356 --> 54:36.732
<i>Went too far, Geneva.</i>

54:36.899 --> 54:38.859
<i>I was crazy to let it go
as far as I did.</i>

54:40.778 --> 54:42.905
Truth is, I am bipolar,

54:43.114 --> 54:44.365
I was off my medication,

54:44.532 --> 54:46.033
and I was in a manic state
in which I was not

54:46.200 --> 54:48.411
in control
of my faculties, so...

54:49.078 --> 54:51.038
I plead not guilty
