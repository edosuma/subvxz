00:54.107 --> 00:55.575
MARSHALL:
Wow, Cap'n Turbot!

00:55.599 --> 00:58.208
That sure is a super
cool-looking...

00:58.325 --> 01:00.068
um, what is it?

01:00.162 --> 01:02.371
It's my new weather blimp,
Marshall.

01:02.418 --> 01:05.215
I loaded Blimpie with tons
of terrific tech.

01:05.379 --> 01:08.028
Digital thermometer, barometer,

01:08.114 --> 01:09.731
wind-speed indicator,

01:09.809 --> 01:14.215
and even a High-Res HD Video Cam
for visual verification.

01:14.334 --> 01:15.967
Nice!

01:16.133 --> 01:18.004
So, what does it do?

01:18.059 --> 01:20.676
Simple, the data downloads
to the Flounder

01:20.731 --> 01:23.504
so I can deduce what will happen
weather-wise!

01:23.598 --> 01:26.887
Uh-huh, but... what does it do?

01:26.965 --> 01:29.434
Ha ha! It tells me when
the weather will change.

01:29.465 --> 01:31.153
(Beeping)

01:31.215 --> 01:33.090
(Gasping) Like now!

01:33.170 --> 01:36.204
Whipping winds on the... whoa!

01:36.449 --> 01:38.050
Don't worry, Cap'n Turbot!

01:38.137 --> 01:39.113
We'll catch you!

01:39.152 --> 01:41.355
Everyone, grab a corner
of that sail.

01:41.433 --> 01:44.183
(Barking)

01:44.808 --> 01:46.824
Hold on, here I come!

01:46.902 --> 01:49.605
Whoaaa!

01:49.707 --> 01:51.182
Thanks, pups.

01:51.269 --> 01:52.777
I better reel in Blimpie.

01:52.894 --> 01:55.410
Hey, pups!
Funny-looking balloon.

01:55.518 --> 01:57.776
Actually, it's called a blimp,
Alex.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.082
ALEX: What are all those
doohickeys on it?

02:00.167 --> 02:02.457
They're not doohickeys!

02:02.613 --> 02:05.238
They're High-Res Digital
Thingamabobbers,

02:05.347 --> 02:08.011
that help Cap'n Turbot tell
when the weather changes.

02:08.101 --> 02:10.434
(Flounder's horn sounding)

02:10.550 --> 02:12.636
A weather-change blimp?

02:12.856 --> 02:14.957
Cool!

02:18.257 --> 02:20.254
Ah, fog again.

02:20.351 --> 02:21.412
Come on, kitties.
(Meowing)

02:21.437 --> 02:24.819
Let's picnic in Adventure Bay,
where it's no doubt sunny.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.356
Argh, so unfair.

02:26.653 --> 02:30.966
If only there was some way
to un-foggy Foggy Bottom.

02:31.692 --> 02:36.083
(Gulls squawking)

02:36.677 --> 02:38.062
(Kittens chattering)

02:38.263 --> 02:40.888
Yes, yes, it looks perfect
for a picnic.

02:40.989 --> 02:41.989
Huh?

02:42.025 --> 02:44.058
(Alex whistling)

02:44.223 --> 02:45.369
Uh, young lad,

02:45.371 --> 02:48.890
do you know anything about
that strange-looking balloon?

02:48.968 --> 02:51.280
It's not a balloon,
it's a blimp!

02:51.350 --> 02:53.116
Cap'n Turbot invented it.

02:53.241 --> 02:56.632
It helps him, um,
change the weather.

02:56.780 --> 02:57.919
Really?

02:57.960 --> 03:01.663
You mean, he can use that
balloon to change the weather?

03:01.780 --> 03:03.249
That's what Rubble said...

03:03.390 --> 03:05.100
and it's a blimp!

03:05.186 --> 03:08.022
No wonder it's always sunny
in Adventure Bay.

03:08.077 --> 03:09.960
That clever captain must have
figured out

03:10.015 --> 03:11.780
how to chase the clouds away.

03:11.850 --> 03:13.991
Kitties, new plan.

03:14.085 --> 03:17.241
We're going to snatch
that weather balloon!

03:17.370 --> 03:18.469
Meow?

03:18.507 --> 03:19.960
Blimp, fine!

03:20.022 --> 03:23.046
We're going to take it
and turn Foggy Bottom

03:23.132 --> 03:25.647
into Sunny All the Time Bottom!

03:25.686 --> 03:28.819
(Laughing)
I'm a genius.

03:31.117 --> 03:33.358
Okay, Marshall, fill 'er up!

03:33.436 --> 03:36.280
(Barking)
Water cannons!

03:40.733 --> 03:43.093
Hey! A giant water dish!

03:43.196 --> 03:44.257
I like it!

03:44.296 --> 03:45.573
No way, Rubble, dude.

03:45.624 --> 03:48.085
This is obviously a swimming...

03:48.201 --> 03:49.186
Water dish.

03:49.211 --> 03:50.257
Cool!

03:50.304 --> 03:51.772
- Awesome!
- Thanks!

03:51.811 --> 03:52.718
(Slurping)

03:52.743 --> 03:54.280
Mmm, watery!

03:54.905 --> 03:55.968
(Blimp beeping)

03:56.030 --> 03:58.163
Listen to those beautiful
bleeps and blurps

03:58.188 --> 03:59.765
coming from my blimp, Wally.

03:59.796 --> 04:01.280
(Wally barking)

04:05.483 --> 04:06.655
(Splashing)

04:06.703 --> 04:07.738
(Wally barking)

04:07.787 --> 04:09.202
No, no, silly Wally.

04:09.233 --> 04:11.288
I told you, it's not a balloon.

04:11.343 --> 04:13.224
It's a blimp!

04:13.304 --> 04:14.679
(Slapping flipper)

04:15.608 --> 04:16.726
Nice snag, kitty, ha ha!

04:16.810 --> 04:20.363
Now, bring that blimp
over to me.

04:21.733 --> 04:23.777
Oh, get back here!

04:23.964 --> 04:25.769
Kitties, help!

04:25.810 --> 04:27.947
(Meowing)

04:30.596 --> 04:31.672
Phew!

04:31.697 --> 04:35.307
Now, to tow this weather changer
back to Foggy Bottom,

04:35.432 --> 04:39.353
we'll make ourselves some nice
fog-free picnic weather!

04:39.478 --> 04:40.705
(Laughing)

04:41.541 --> 04:44.465
Sounds like storm-free
smooth sailing.

04:44.627 --> 04:46.041
(Beeping)

04:46.192 --> 04:47.580
Huh?

04:47.705 --> 04:50.194
Wait, there are no trees
in the sky.

04:50.196 --> 04:51.291
(Gulls squawking)

04:51.353 --> 04:53.170
And there's no Blimpie, either!

04:53.221 --> 04:54.572
(Slapping flipper)

04:57.536 --> 04:58.893

04:59.088 --> 05:01.643
<i>Ryder, my wonderful weather
balloon...</i>

05:01.799 --> 05:04.518
<i>Blimp... has been whisked away
by wild winds!</i>

05:04.603 --> 05:07.088
Really?
But there's no wind here.

05:07.158 --> 05:10.064
<i>Well then, how did Blimpie
blow away?</i>

05:10.182 --> 05:11.682
(Beeping)

05:17.822 --> 05:19.590
Mayor Humdinger took it.

05:19.615 --> 05:20.824
We'll get it back!

05:20.893 --> 05:24.161
No job is too big;
no pup is too small.

05:24.221 --> 05:25.377

08:20.236 --> 08:21.681
Chase, I'm afraid
all that pulling

08:21.744 --> 08:23.259
may tear the blimp apart.

08:23.298 --> 08:24.705
We'd better release the winch.

<i>a big, blustery breeze will
be blowing back</i>

traffic away from the bridge.

10:14.690 --> 10:16.674
<i>Marshall, Rubble, Rocky, Zuma!</i>

10:16.759 --> 10:19.135
<i>Head for the pier
and grab that old sail!</i>

10:19.221 --> 10:21.487
The one we used to rescue
Cap'n Turbot?

10:21.512 --> 10:22.384
<i>That's it!</i>

10:22.409 --> 10:24.502
<i>Now, bring it to the bridge,
fast!</i>

10:25.354 --> 10:26.666
(Chase howling)

10:26.784 --> 10:29.057
Okay, Chase, use your megaphone

10:29.112 --> 10:30.899
to tell Mayor Humdinger
to drop down!

10:30.924 --> 10:32.416
(Through megaphone):
Mayor Humdinger!

10:32.510 --> 10:33.830
You can let go!

10:33.932 --> 10:37.034
Let go? But it's so far!

10:37.159 --> 10:39.877
Don't worry! We'll catch you!

10:40.049 --> 10:42.333
(All shouting)

10:42.411 --> 10:44.301
Are we still falling?

10:44.356 --> 10:46.597
You can open your eyes now,
Mr. Mayor.

10:46.622 --> 10:47.684
You're safe!

10:47.709 --> 10:50.989
And now it's time to return
Blimpie to its rightful owner.

10:51.098 --> 10:52.833
But can I just borrow it
long enough

10:52.887 --> 10:55.372
to change the weather
in Foggy Bottom?

10:55.653 --> 10:58.637
The blimp just records changes
in the weather.

10:58.715 --> 11:01.153
It doesn't actually change it.

11:01.178 --> 11:02.065
Really?

11:02.090 --> 11:03.903
Uh, I mean, I knew that.

11:03.965 --> 11:05.294
Baaaah!

11:07.039 --> 11:09.006
(Beeping)

11:09.200 --> 11:11.403
Huh?

11:11.777 --> 11:12.872
Blimpie!

11:12.919 --> 11:14.661
Oh, I've missed you!

11:14.715 --> 11:16.684
Blimpie took quite a trip,

11:16.794 --> 11:18.989
but he sure looks happy
to be home!

11:19.028 --> 11:20.120
Thanks, Skye!

11:20.145 --> 11:22.778
And thanks to the whole pack
of PAW Patrol pups!

11:22.887 --> 11:24.526
Happy to lend a paw!

11:24.590 --> 11:27.491
Whenever you have a problem,
just yelp for help!

11:27.551 --> 11:29.028
(Barking)

11:29.434 --> 11:30.950
You're all good pups.

11:31.176 --> 11:33.208
Blimpie says the wind's
whooshed away.

11:33.301 --> 11:38.068
It'll be another nice, sunny day
in Adventure Bay, ha ha!

11:38.209 --> 11:41.076
Ooh, but not so nice
in Foggy Bottom.

11:41.115 --> 11:43.951
Blimpie says it'll be cloudy
with a chance of...

11:44.006 --> 11:45.592
(Thunder crashing)

11:45.678 --> 11:48.046
Ah, sure, lightning.
Yeah, what else is new?

11:48.085 --> 11:49.859
