WEBVTT

00:20.063 --> 00:22.544
- I got it.
Hey, guys.

00:22.587 --> 00:25.634
- Sweetheart, sweetheart,
pass the ball back?

00:25.677 --> 00:27.027
Give him a big kick.

00:29.290 --> 00:33.294
- Well done.

00:56.012 --> 00:58.841
- Oh! Champion!
Oh!

00:58.884 --> 01:01.191
The crowd goes wild!
Yes!

01:01.235 --> 01:05.326
Oh, Luna!
Luna for the win!

01:07.545 --> 01:09.199
Everything okay?

01:09.243 --> 01:10.766
- Not unless
you're a doctor, no.

01:10.809 --> 01:13.551
- Uh, As a matter fact,
Dr. Max Goodwin,

01:13.595 --> 01:16.902
- Hampstead Hospital, adjacent.
- Good enough.

01:16.946 --> 01:18.469
How can I help?

01:18.513 --> 01:20.950
- Uh, I got a bit of a problem
with my meat and two veg.

01:20.993 --> 01:22.865
Meat and two...

01:22.908 --> 01:24.214
your meat and two--
Right, yes, got it.

01:24.258 --> 01:25.650
What seems to be the problem?

01:25.694 --> 01:28.000
- Well, it's itching
like a bastard, and my lady--

01:28.044 --> 01:30.090
she won't have it off with me
until I get it sorted.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.744
So, even now, the carcass
is chafing.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.224
- Do you want to take a gander?
- No, no, no.

01:34.268 --> 01:35.573
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

01:35.617 --> 01:38.924
Um, I think you have
a bad case of jock itch.

01:38.968 --> 01:40.143
Is that it, do you think?

01:40.187 --> 01:41.275
- I can write you
a prescription,

01:41.318 --> 01:42.319
and it should be fine.

01:42.363 --> 01:44.713
Oh, mate, thank you.

01:44.756 --> 01:46.367
Thank you so much.
You're a lifesaver.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.325
Hey, boys, anyone else

01:48.369 --> 01:50.327
got some freaky stuff
going on below the belt?

01:50.371 --> 01:52.068
Found ourselves a team doctor!

01:52.112 --> 01:53.939
Great.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.551
<i>- So I said to the guy,</i>
<i>"Let's get the head</i>

01:56.594 --> 01:57.769
"of psych on right now,
and let's see

01:57.813 --> 01:59.336
how attached he is
to city funding."

01:59.380 --> 02:01.164
- Nice power move.
- Thank you very much.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.427
You know, it worked because
the university will no longer

02:03.471 --> 02:04.733
be dumping
their un-housed patients

02:04.776 --> 02:07.170
on New Amsterdam's doors,
so, mm!

02:07.214 --> 02:08.606
If I may say, you're kind of

02:08.650 --> 02:10.042
the perfect
Behavioral Health Chair.

02:10.086 --> 02:11.305
- You may.
- You patient and kind

02:11.348 --> 02:12.741
most of the time,

02:12.784 --> 02:14.308
but you're also
commanding when you need to be.

02:14.351 --> 02:15.918
Your wife must be
super into that.

02:15.961 --> 02:18.616
- Martin doesn't like it when
I call him my wife usually.

02:19.835 --> 02:22.142
You're gay?

02:22.185 --> 02:23.752
- Yeah.
Yes, I am.

02:23.795 --> 02:24.709
I thought...

02:24.753 --> 02:27.321
- Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

02:27.364 --> 02:28.496
Don't be?

02:28.539 --> 02:30.237
- No, as in
because of the flirting.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.239
The flirting?

02:32.282 --> 02:34.241
What?
Flirting?

02:34.284 --> 02:35.633
I only meant it in a fun way

02:35.677 --> 02:37.635
because, like, obviously
nothing could ever happen.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.985
- Yeah, no, no, of course,
yeah, and, you know,

02:40.029 --> 02:42.118
nothing has changed because
nothing can happen, Trevor,

02:42.162 --> 02:44.425
so...

02:44.468 --> 02:45.600
I'm not a home wrecker.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.210
- I know that.
I know you're not.

02:47.254 --> 02:50.692
And, uh, I--everything is...

02:50.735 --> 02:51.954
everything's fine.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.434
You didn't do anything
wrong, Trevor, okay?

02:53.477 --> 02:54.652
So let's--you don't
need to change a thing.

02:54.696 --> 02:57.220
- Let's just leave it alone.
- Okay.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.224
Uh, I got to deal with this.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.400
- Sure. Okay, yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.708
No!

03:06.751 --> 03:11.669
Why isn't it working?

03:11.713 --> 03:13.802
- Hey, hey,
seem to be having

03:13.845 --> 03:15.107
- little bit of trouble there.
- Stay back.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.587
Yeah, no, I will.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.372
I'm just wondering why
you're trying to pick that up.

03:18.415 --> 03:21.026
- There's something wrong
with this place.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.767
I'm very strong.

03:22.811 --> 03:25.727
I can pick up anything--
elephants, pyramids.

03:25.770 --> 03:28.338
- Super strength, huh?
So you're like Superman.

03:28.382 --> 03:30.297
- No. No, I'm not like
Superman.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.037
- Right.
- I'm real.

03:32.081 --> 03:34.344
I have strength.

03:34.388 --> 03:36.520
- Yeah, okay.
I hear you.

03:36.564 --> 03:40.220
- Why can't I pick up the desk?
- I don't know.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.352
- What did you people do?
Huh?

03:42.396 --> 03:44.354
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.530
- Stop, stop.
- Adam!

03:46.574 --> 03:49.794
- Knock it off.
- Stop!

03:49.838 --> 03:53.233
- Now, get in your gurney,
calm down.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.762
I am not gonna tell you twice.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.425
How did you do that?

04:13.296 --> 04:15.646
It's my brother.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.953
Oh.

04:27.876 --> 04:30.748
- Morning.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.620
- Hmm, good morning.
- Great morning.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.186
Played a little football
in the park

04:34.230 --> 04:36.667
with Luna and my new mates,
and she even scored a goal.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.800
Oh, and the crowd went wild.

04:46.677 --> 04:50.812
Sorry, I'm just not at the same
level or joy that you are.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.033
You all right?

04:56.992 --> 04:59.255
What's wrong?

04:59.299 --> 05:02.476
My mother called again.

05:02.519 --> 05:05.087
And--and she just--

05:05.130 --> 05:07.872
she just has this knack for
completely ruining everything

05:07.916 --> 05:09.526
as you just experienced.

05:09.570 --> 05:13.269
- Yeah,
what was she calling about?

05:13.313 --> 05:14.705
- Combo platter--

05:14.749 --> 05:18.361
Guilt trip, uh, followed
by a judgmental tirade

05:18.405 --> 05:21.495
with a side order
of profound disappointment.

05:21.538 --> 05:23.888
Sorry, I shouldn't be burdening
you with all this.

05:23.932 --> 05:26.500
No, no, burden me.

05:26.543 --> 05:29.154
I want you to, always.

05:31.983 --> 05:34.072
- You've never even met
my mother.

05:34.116 --> 05:36.771
- I was beginning to think
you were hiding me,

05:36.814 --> 05:39.643
ashamed of me,
but then, uh--

05:39.687 --> 05:43.168
then I realized
that in this country,

05:43.212 --> 05:45.475
I'm the one with the charming
and sexy accent.

05:45.519 --> 05:48.086
- Mm.
Yeah, I have no doubt

05:48.130 --> 05:50.001
that she would be charmed,
but I suspect

05:50.045 --> 05:54.354
- I would be utterly miserable.
- Mm.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.007
Wasn't part of the reason
we moved here

05:56.051 --> 05:58.183
was for you to be
closer with your family?

06:00.447 --> 06:02.840
- Yes.

06:02.884 --> 06:07.454
- Yes, okay.
I will book a lunch for us.

06:07.497 --> 06:09.412
And now I would
like you to distract me

06:09.456 --> 06:11.414
from the terrible decision
that I just made.

06:11.458 --> 06:14.591
- Understood.

06:17.594 --> 06:20.249
- What do we got?
- Frickin' MVA.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.947
- MVA's your jam.
- It's Leyla.

06:22.991 --> 06:24.993
I mean, I've tried everything
to reach her and nothing,

06:25.036 --> 06:26.603
radio silence.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.344
I mean, I have no idea
if she's even okay.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.302
- It's driving me nuts.
- Hmm.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.348
- "Hmm"?
- What?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.437
That's all I get?

06:34.481 --> 06:35.656
What?

06:35.699 --> 06:38.180
- Floyd Reynolds,
you know something.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.530
- I know every bit of nothing.
- Spill it.

06:41.923 --> 06:43.533
- Saved by the gurney.
- This isn't over.

06:43.577 --> 06:45.187
- MVA,
car versus bridge abutment.

06:45.230 --> 06:48.756
38-year-old restrained driver,
legs and pelvis trapped in car

06:48.799 --> 06:50.105
with severe crush injuries.

06:50.148 --> 06:51.802
Hypotensive and tachy
in the field.

06:51.846 --> 06:54.544
- All right, I got them.
Let's get him in trauma one.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.328
- 37-year-old woman

06:56.372 --> 06:57.547
and four-month-old infant

06:57.591 --> 06:59.244
were both restrained passengers
in a MVA.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.550
Ambulatory at the scene.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.552
- Full eval pending.
- "Pending"?

07:02.596 --> 07:03.988
- Mom wouldn't let go
of the baby

07:04.032 --> 07:05.555
till I got to the hospital,
not even for a second.

07:05.599 --> 07:06.513
- All right,
let's get her to bay 28.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.036
Let's go.

07:08.079 --> 07:11.735
- One, two, three.
- How bad is it?

07:11.779 --> 07:14.172
- Pulling off
the field dressings now.

07:16.784 --> 07:19.177
- Must've been
one hell of a crash.

07:22.616 --> 07:26.010
- Baby seems fine.
- She won't stop crying.

07:26.054 --> 07:30.014
- She senses your stress, and
the energy here isn't helping.

07:30.058 --> 07:31.625
And babies cry.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.453
- That is exactly what the
doctors in Westchester told us.

07:33.496 --> 07:34.845
- Okay, I sense
that you're upset.

07:34.889 --> 07:37.108
- You need to listen to me.
- Ma'am, calm down.

07:37.152 --> 07:40.634
- Tiya is not our first child.
We had a child ten years ago.

07:42.374 --> 07:45.116
He died at four months,
exactly Tiya's age now.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.423
He cried the exact same way
right before he died.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.817
What was wrong?

07:49.860 --> 07:51.819
The doctors never knew.

07:51.862 --> 07:54.517
I will never forget
the sounds of those cries.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.040
It's happening again.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.738
Something is wrong
with my baby.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.870
You have to believe me.

08:07.312 --> 08:07.487
.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.489
- So just keep doing those
finger exercises

08:09.532 --> 08:10.794
whenever you're at a stoplight,

08:10.838 --> 08:12.448
and that should help
with the carpal tunnel.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.145
- Thanks, Dr. Goodwin.
- Sure.

08:14.189 --> 08:16.278
- When do you meet
the mother-in-law, then?

08:16.321 --> 08:18.193
- I'm on my way
there now, actually.

08:18.236 --> 08:19.107
- Oh, give her a bit
of the old flannel.

08:19.150 --> 08:20.804
You'll be all right.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.024
- I would ask what that means,
but I don't think I'll need it.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.722
- Moms love me.
- Yeah, seems about right.

08:25.766 --> 08:28.072
- Oi, Doc!

08:29.987 --> 08:32.424
- Uh, uh, just set him
down here.

08:32.468 --> 08:35.471
- Easy, mate.
- Easy, easy.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.473
- Had a few too many pints
there, Colin?

08:37.517 --> 08:40.128
- I don't drink.
I never have.

08:40.171 --> 08:41.695
Your pulse is sky high.

08:41.738 --> 08:43.958
- Hands been shaking, too.
Can you help him?

08:44.001 --> 08:45.699
- Look out.

08:45.742 --> 08:49.572
- Oh, he's gonna puke.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.444
- Why's that happening to me?
- Okay, okay.

08:52.488 --> 08:55.143
Let's get him up.
Let's get him up.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.972
- Come on.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.452
Mmm, these have a nice spice.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.717
And Mina, how is she?

09:03.760 --> 09:06.328
Oh, she's grown glamorous.

09:06.371 --> 09:08.199
She's studying improv
this term.

09:08.243 --> 09:11.202
Oh, she's not here?

09:11.246 --> 09:13.291
I assumed that's why
you were visiting.

09:16.207 --> 09:19.428
- Actually,
I am living here now.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.563
Sorry?

09:25.216 --> 09:28.785
We've spoken several times,

09:28.829 --> 09:32.006
and you neglected to mention
that you moved back home.

09:32.049 --> 09:33.834
- I-I guess I just knew

09:33.877 --> 09:37.881
that it would bring up, um,
a lot for us.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.796
When did you get here?

09:39.840 --> 09:42.277
Seven, eight weeks ago.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.584
You've been here two months,

09:44.627 --> 09:46.542
and you couldn't be bothered
to let me know?

09:46.586 --> 09:49.893
- It's not that simple.
We wanted to get settled first.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.460
Who's we?

09:53.070 --> 09:56.247
- I've moved here
with Max and Luna.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.077
- Your cats?

10:00.121 --> 10:01.949
No, Mum.

10:01.992 --> 10:04.778
They're the man I'm seeing
and his lovely daughter.

10:04.821 --> 10:07.041
His lovely daughter.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.304
Yep, what about it?

10:09.347 --> 10:12.046
- You keep insisting on raising
other people's children,

10:12.089 --> 10:14.439
Mina, this Luna.

10:14.483 --> 10:17.181
If you want to be a mother
so badly, have a baby.

10:17.225 --> 10:20.881
What happened to
the egg freezing and all that?

10:20.924 --> 10:25.363
- My fertility treatments
were not an easy experience.

10:25.407 --> 10:27.714
- They were not
a cheap experience either.

10:27.757 --> 10:32.109
So much money, so many years,
you just gave up.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.635
- You wonder why
I never tell you stuff.

10:35.678 --> 10:39.334
'Cause when I do, your response
is purely designed to hurt me.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.379
I'll tell you something.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.251
You get hurt that easily,

10:43.294 --> 10:45.732
maybe you're not cut out
for motherhood?

10:45.775 --> 10:47.603
It's best you never know
what it's like to have

10:47.647 --> 10:50.911
your child treat you like some
errand they put off for months.

10:50.954 --> 10:55.089
I'm not a chore.
I'm your mother.

10:55.132 --> 10:57.918
I gave up everything for you.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.267
Yeah.

10:59.310 --> 11:02.313
Real Mother of the Year
material, you are.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.837
What's that supposed to mean?

11:03.880 --> 11:08.319
- Ready for your wine, ladies?
both: Yes.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.286
Hi.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.591
- This has been
a day from hell.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.681
- Yeah, I-I can only imagine.

11:21.724 --> 11:25.989
Um, anything you need from me,
just you name it.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.774
You committed Adam, right?

11:27.817 --> 11:29.689
- Yes, 72-hour hold.

11:31.386 --> 11:32.692
- Good, then you can
let him out.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.911
I can...

11:34.955 --> 11:36.652
Out?

11:36.696 --> 11:39.220
- I'm his guardian,
and I want to take him home.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.962
Um...

11:42.005 --> 11:44.616
Adam is potentially dangerous.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.923
Not to me.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.490
Not to me.

11:48.533 --> 11:51.798
- He had
a full psychotic break.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.800
What he needs right now
are trained professionals.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.192
That's--that's it.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.107
- He's been living with me
for years.

11:57.151 --> 12:01.764
I take care of him, and
I am a trained professional.

12:01.808 --> 12:05.594
- No, not right now you're not.
You're his sister.

12:05.637 --> 12:09.772
And I will not compromise
his health and safety or yours.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.691
Either you release him,

12:15.735 --> 12:18.825
or I will go petition
the court.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.786
- I think a 72-hour hold
is more than--

12:23.830 --> 12:25.745
Dr. Wilder!

12:33.883 --> 12:37.495
- BP's crashing.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.846
- Cytokine storm
from the crush injuries.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.282
Start a dobutamine drip.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.284
- Losing blood everywhere.
He's in DIC.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.547
- Hang a six pack of FFP.
- On it.

12:45.590 --> 12:48.724
- Can we get more gauze?
- Coming.

12:48.768 --> 12:53.033
- Whoa, hey.
- Any word on Tiya?

12:53.076 --> 12:55.339
She's still being evaluated.

12:56.906 --> 13:01.389
- Something's wrong with Tiya.
I know it.

13:01.432 --> 13:05.219
I was driving so fast.
I had to get her here.

13:05.262 --> 13:08.048
I had to save my daughter.

13:08.091 --> 13:10.702
- If there's anything wrong,
we'll find it, okay?

13:10.746 --> 13:13.053
We got you.
Just relax.

13:22.410 --> 13:25.239
- Got labs back on the baby--
all normal.

13:25.282 --> 13:28.068
- What?
There has to be something.

13:28.111 --> 13:32.376
LFTs, thyroid, electrolytes...

13:32.420 --> 13:33.638
everything's fine.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.249
That's a good thing, right?

13:35.292 --> 13:36.772
Help!

13:41.124 --> 13:42.778
Oh, my God, is she dying?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.519
- No, she's not dying.
She's having a seizure.

13:44.562 --> 13:47.348
Walsh, get me
.7 milligrams of Lorazepam.

13:57.488 --> 13:57.880
.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.969
I told you I don't drink.

14:00.013 --> 14:01.492
And now you're trying
to make me do vodka shots?

14:01.536 --> 14:02.929
For your health.

14:02.972 --> 14:05.235
You have something called
gut fermentation syndrome.

14:05.279 --> 14:06.584
- That sounds bad.
- Oh, bloody hell.

14:06.628 --> 14:08.586
- It just means that, uh,
due to excessive yeast

14:08.630 --> 14:10.588
in your digestive tract,
every carb that you eat

14:10.632 --> 14:12.068
gets fermented into
alcohol inside your body.

14:12.112 --> 14:13.591
That sounds quite nice.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.332
- Well, if there's already
lots of alcohol in my body,

14:15.376 --> 14:16.899
why you trying
to force-feed me more?

14:16.943 --> 14:19.249
- Well, because when I
prescribed the antifungal

14:19.293 --> 14:21.425
- for your...
- Meat and two veg.

14:21.469 --> 14:23.123
- Right, it wiped out
all the yeast in your body,

14:23.166 --> 14:24.559
which means that alcohol
is no longer

14:24.602 --> 14:26.909
entering your bloodstream,
which means...

14:26.953 --> 14:28.432
- Colin's got the beer shakes.
- Yeah.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.347
But a bit of day drinking
should clear that right up.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.262
And in 24 hours,
you'll be fine.

14:32.306 --> 14:35.091
All right.

14:35.135 --> 14:38.181
That is awful.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.575
- Come on, lads, we can't
let him go through this alone.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.272
Oi, another round over here.

14:42.316 --> 14:43.883
- Uh, No, no,
none for me, thanks.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.537
I've got a mother-in-law
to meet...

14:46.581 --> 14:47.712
a half hour ago.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.889
Uh, I got to go.
Good luck.

14:51.151 --> 14:53.153
Hey, you got a sec?

14:53.196 --> 14:55.720
- I'm prepping Dion
for a double amputation.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.331
Oh, God, that poor family.

14:57.374 --> 14:58.941
- Tell me about.
How's their baby?

14:58.985 --> 15:00.638
- Well, we managed
to stop the seizures,

15:00.682 --> 15:02.466
but still no diagnosis.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.772
Given family history,

15:03.815 --> 15:05.730
it's got to be a genetic
disorder of some type.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.123
That's a crowded room.

15:07.167 --> 15:09.952
- Tay Sachs, Gaucher,
Fabry, Pompe,

15:09.996 --> 15:11.562
mucopolysaccharidosis.

15:11.606 --> 15:13.521
- You need a separate
draw of blood for each test.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.044
The baby doesn't
have that much blood.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.960
- Exactly, so I'm sequencing
her entire DNA.

15:18.004 --> 15:20.310
Find the defective gene
directly.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.138
The family already
lost one kid.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.749
I'm not gonna let them
lose another.

15:24.793 --> 15:28.231
- Leyla came to me this morning
for a recommendation.

15:31.191 --> 15:33.671
- She's coming back?
- Honestly, I don't know.

15:33.715 --> 15:36.544
I shouldn't have said anything,
but I knew I'd cave eventually.

15:36.587 --> 15:37.980
Better to not drag it out.

15:57.391 --> 16:01.656
- They wouldn't let Adam out.
Request denied.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.397
- Yeah, I know.
I heard.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.964
I'm sorry.

16:06.835 --> 16:09.272
Are you?

16:09.316 --> 16:12.536
- Can you tell me about
your relationship with Adam?

16:12.580 --> 16:16.497
Maybe I can get
a clearer picture of who he is?

16:24.026 --> 16:25.636
Do you mind?

16:31.207 --> 16:33.079
Whenever you're ready.

16:36.386 --> 16:40.042
- I was the only deaf kid
in a hearing family,

16:40.086 --> 16:42.566
so everything was all about me.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.047
You know, there was--there was
no talking during meals

16:45.091 --> 16:46.788
so that everybody
could practice ASL.

16:46.831 --> 16:51.401
And my parents moved our
entire lives across the country

16:51.445 --> 16:55.362
so that I could go
to the best possible school.

17:01.194 --> 17:04.023
It would've been easy
for Adam to resent me.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.375
He never did.

17:08.418 --> 17:12.248
He was happy.
He was doing his own thing.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.381
- So...
- So...

17:15.991 --> 17:18.515
We never saw it coming.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.430
No, no one does.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.390
But we could have.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.261
There were--there were signs.

17:25.305 --> 17:26.654
We just didn't see them

17:26.697 --> 17:30.484
because we were all so--
so focused on me.

17:30.527 --> 17:34.096
- Adam's psychosis
is not on you.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.316
No, it's not.
You know that, right?

17:36.359 --> 17:38.274
Even if you had
seen the symptoms earlier,

17:38.318 --> 17:39.971
it wouldn't
have changed anything.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.843
He still would've gotten sick.

17:41.886 --> 17:44.715
- It would've.
- It would've.

17:51.853 --> 17:55.552
- Do you know where Adam
had his first psychotic break?

17:56.945 --> 17:58.468
College...

17:58.512 --> 18:02.168
hundreds of miles from home,
surrounded by strangers.

18:03.778 --> 18:06.433
He jumped out of his window

18:06.476 --> 18:10.001
because he thought
he could fly.

18:10.045 --> 18:12.221
He broke four bones.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.397
And you know what they did?

18:16.182 --> 18:19.663
They put him in jail
to dry him out.

18:19.707 --> 18:23.145
They thought he was high.

18:23.189 --> 18:26.322
He could've died.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.759
- He could've.
- He could've

18:32.546 --> 18:36.332
- He needed me.
- He needed me.

18:36.376 --> 18:40.380
He was scared out of his mind,
and he was alone.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.166
I wasn't there.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.038
You think I feel guilty?

18:47.082 --> 18:50.129
- No.
- No, this is not guilt.

18:51.826 --> 18:55.003
This is what I owe.

19:03.316 --> 19:05.970
- All right, the lab has
sequenced all of Tiya's DNA.

19:06.014 --> 19:08.799
Now we have to find the gene
that's threatening her life.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.279
I'm not gonna lie.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.542
I don't know much
about DNA-sorting software.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.327
- Good, 'cause
we don't have any.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.155
We're doing it by hand.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.639
Oh, my God.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.598
- How's this
even going to work?

19:24.641 --> 19:27.383
- All right, this stack here
is Tiya's DNA--all of it.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.124
The research lab went
from one end

19:29.168 --> 19:30.473
of her genetic sequence
to the other.

19:30.517 --> 19:31.605
Clearly.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.607
- This stack here
is the DNA sequence

19:33.650 --> 19:36.827
to every single known genetic
disorder that effects infants.

19:36.871 --> 19:39.787
Take one from the disease pile,
find the corresponding section

19:39.830 --> 19:42.093
in Tiya's DNA,
see if you can find a match.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.399
Just like that?

19:43.443 --> 19:45.227
- Well,
it's not rocket science.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.098
Anyone who can match a pattern
can do it.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.622
Come on, let's go.

19:50.667 --> 19:54.236
- Full amputation of both
lower extremities complete.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.803
- The crush injuries
extend further up.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.587
We need to widen
the field of resection.

19:57.631 --> 20:00.329
- But that means going
into the abdominal cavity.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.505
- Well, if we don't get
all the crushed tissue,

20:02.549 --> 20:05.378
we won't be able to control
the DIC and cytokine storms.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.336
- Resecting more tissue
will certainly get us

20:07.380 --> 20:10.296
into vital organs
that he can't live without.

20:10.339 --> 20:13.255
- And if we do nothing,
he'll surely die.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.259
Scalpel.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.396
<i>Hey, you've reached Max.</i>

20:23.439 --> 20:25.224
<i>I can't take your call,</i>
<i>so leave a message.</i>

20:25.267 --> 20:26.616
- Max, where are you?

20:26.660 --> 20:30.968
You're an hour late,
and she's been completely...

20:31.012 --> 20:32.361
Oh, damn it.

20:32.405 --> 20:35.016
Mum, please, Max is
gonna be here any moment.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.191
I really want him to meet you.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.323
Why should I wait for a man

20:37.366 --> 20:38.498
who can't be bothered
to show up?

20:38.541 --> 20:39.890
I've spent enough
of my life doing that.

20:39.934 --> 20:41.849
- Wow, you never miss a trick,
do you?

20:41.892 --> 20:44.852
- Any opportunity to insult Baba.
- Helen.

20:45.896 --> 20:48.986
I don't know why you still use
that name for your father.

20:49.030 --> 20:52.512
Sweet little pet name for the
man who walked out and left us.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.516
You're a liar.

20:57.778 --> 21:00.259
- How dare you
speak to me like that?

21:00.302 --> 21:01.825
He didn't walk out the door.

21:01.869 --> 21:03.305
You drove him away.
I remember.

21:03.349 --> 21:06.265
Mum, please...

21:06.308 --> 21:09.006
just stop.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.400
I remember him begging to stay.

21:11.444 --> 21:13.576
I remember him holding me.

21:13.620 --> 21:17.319
And I remember you ripping me
out of his hands

21:17.363 --> 21:19.887
while you screamed at him
to get out.

21:21.758 --> 21:25.501
And then you spent
the next 30 years telling me

21:25.545 --> 21:28.330
that he abandoned us,
that he's a racist,

21:28.374 --> 21:30.201
that he didn't love me.

21:30.245 --> 21:33.466
That lie shaped
my entire future,

21:33.509 --> 21:37.296
my feelings towards kids,
towards men.

21:38.862 --> 21:40.777
He called me.

21:42.910 --> 21:47.218
He called me on his deathbed,
and I hung up on him.

21:47.262 --> 21:51.484
I will never have even an idea
of a father because of you.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.703
So the next time--

21:53.747 --> 21:55.444
the next time you want
to talk about Baba,

21:55.488 --> 21:57.881
I would--I would love for you
to try something--

21:57.925 --> 22:01.624
try something at which
you have very little practice.

22:03.278 --> 22:05.062
Shut up.

22:11.721 --> 22:14.158
- Oh, good.
You started without me.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.638
Uh, so sorry I'm late.
I, uh--

22:15.682 --> 22:17.727
Crazy story.

22:17.771 --> 22:21.122
- You wanted this lunch
so much, you have it.

22:27.215 --> 22:28.390
Hi.

22:31.306 --> 22:31.480
.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.177
- Exposing the rectus
abdominis muscle.

22:33.221 --> 22:35.702
Scalpel, forceps.

22:37.660 --> 22:40.533
Resecting the necrotic portion.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.361
That is a large cut.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.406
- Yeah,
and I didn't even get it all.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.234
- Let's see how far down
the destruction goes.

22:46.277 --> 22:48.323
Retractor.

22:50.673 --> 22:55.548
- Just loops of dead bowel.
- And the bladder's in pieces.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.463
There's no end to the damage.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.029
- Cautery.
- Okay.

22:59.073 --> 23:01.162
All right, look, scalpel.

23:01.205 --> 23:02.685
If he's gonna stand any chance,

23:02.729 --> 23:06.559
we're gonna have to slash
and burn as fast as we can.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.091
Hey.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.573
Would you mind
if we have a little chat?

23:20.616 --> 23:24.315
- I'm a little foggy.
Can you come back later?

23:24.359 --> 23:26.970
- Your sister told me
about the break you suffered

23:27.014 --> 23:30.104
in college when you tried
to fly out of your dorm.

23:30.147 --> 23:32.280
Do I have to talk about this?

23:32.323 --> 23:35.283
- But today, um,
you weren't trying to fly.

23:35.326 --> 23:38.895
You were trying to, uh, pick up
buildings, right?

23:40.288 --> 23:41.724
So?

23:41.768 --> 23:45.946
- So psychotic delusions
almost never change over time.

23:52.169 --> 23:54.389
Why do you think
that happened, Adam?

23:54.433 --> 23:56.217
I don't know.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.440
I don't know.
I don't know.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.833
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

24:03.877 --> 24:06.357
- Stop!
- Stop, you're upsetting him.

24:06.401 --> 24:08.011
It's all right.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.014
Adam.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.802
I need you
to look at your sister...

24:15.845 --> 24:18.239
and tell her the truth.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.419
Adam.

24:44.308 --> 24:48.312
I faked it this morning.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.370
I don't know.

25:02.413 --> 25:04.503
I don't know
what I was thinking.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.156
I think I do.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.462
You were maybe thinking

25:07.506 --> 25:10.160
that you could become
an in-patient here.

25:10.204 --> 25:11.510
- Why?
- Why?

25:13.599 --> 25:15.949
- So he doesn't have to
live with you.

25:21.171 --> 25:24.610
Adam. Adam!

25:28.135 --> 25:32.574
- Last week
your friend came over.

25:32.618 --> 25:35.142
You went out for drinks.

25:41.757 --> 25:45.805
It was the happiest
you've looked in years.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.592
You never go out.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.768
Don't date.

25:52.812 --> 25:54.901
- Because of me.
- No!

25:54.944 --> 25:56.816
I'm a burden.

25:56.859 --> 25:58.948
I'm ruining your life.

26:01.255 --> 26:03.866
I want to move out.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.838
Anything?

26:18.881 --> 26:20.666
Anyone?

26:22.798 --> 26:25.714
Okay.

26:25.758 --> 26:27.107
Dr. Bloom?

26:27.150 --> 26:28.804
Oh, sorry, Carl.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.153
Uh, We're gonna clean up,

26:30.197 --> 26:31.938
but I think we're gonna
be here all night.

26:31.981 --> 26:33.635
That's why I came.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.942
My little boy
has Apert Syndrome,

26:35.985 --> 26:38.597
so I'd like to help you
if I can.

26:40.163 --> 26:43.427
- Yeah, you can.
Yeah.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.038
Thank you, Carl.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.561
Here.

26:48.998 --> 26:50.913
So...

27:43.879 --> 27:46.186
- We've managed to preserve
kidneys, colon,

27:46.229 --> 27:49.842
- small intestine, ureters.
- We got it all.

28:11.602 --> 28:15.606
- I got these for your mom, but
I figured you could use them.

28:16.651 --> 28:19.872
Wouldn't really categorize
the rest of lunch as pleasant,

28:19.915 --> 28:22.135
but, uh, we got there.

28:23.876 --> 28:27.749
Wow, you know, she's had
a lot thrown at her at once.

28:27.793 --> 28:31.231
I mean, Mina, me, Luna,

28:31.274 --> 28:34.582
and I think, really...

28:34.625 --> 28:37.803
she just wants
to feel included...

28:37.846 --> 28:41.589
like she matters to you
as much as you matter to her.

28:41.632 --> 28:44.810
So, when I threw out
the idea of a family night,

28:44.853 --> 28:46.463
she--she lit up.

28:46.507 --> 28:48.117
And the idea would be
that once a week we would all--

28:48.161 --> 28:50.729
- Stop.
- What?

28:50.772 --> 28:55.559
- I didn't ask you to try
and fix things with my mother.

28:55.603 --> 29:00.303
- No, you didn't,
but you did leave me there.

29:02.436 --> 29:05.395
- That's 'cause
I just detonated

29:05.439 --> 29:07.180
my entire life with her.

29:07.223 --> 29:10.705
- Yeah.
Sorry, uh...I'm confused.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.099
I thought a big part
of why we moved here

29:13.142 --> 29:15.492
was you wanting to connect
with her.

29:15.536 --> 29:18.234
- Yes, connect with her, Max,
not to appease her.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.801
- Yeah, right,
so you can only do that

29:19.845 --> 29:22.021
if you're in
the same room together, right?

29:22.064 --> 29:24.414
I mean, what's so wrong
about inviting her to dinner?

29:24.458 --> 29:26.590
- Max, these are not your
problems to fix--they're mine.

29:26.634 --> 29:29.419
- Okay, when I moved
across an ocean for you,

29:29.463 --> 29:31.334
your problems became ours.

29:31.378 --> 29:33.119
- Don't you dare
use that against me.

29:33.162 --> 29:34.729
- I'm not using anything
against you.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.340
- Moving here for me,
leaving New Amsterdam for me--

29:37.384 --> 29:39.212
that is the trump card
that you can use

29:39.255 --> 29:40.648
in every argument
we are ever gonna have.

29:40.691 --> 29:42.258
It's the one thing you can say

29:42.302 --> 29:44.130
that's gonna shut
everything else down.

29:44.173 --> 29:45.871
- I'm not trying
to shut anything down.

29:45.914 --> 29:48.743
I have been begging you
to talk to me about this.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.311
And you won't,
so now you're mad at me

29:51.354 --> 29:52.486
for not knowing what you want.

29:52.529 --> 29:54.575
- That's because
I don't know what I want!

30:04.063 --> 30:06.413
From her or from me?

30:17.337 --> 30:20.470
Max, I need you...

30:20.514 --> 30:24.083
to stay out of my family.

30:24.126 --> 30:26.389
Oh, okay.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.832
I guess I thought
we were a family.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.445
Are we...

30:42.666 --> 30:44.886
A family?

31:03.296 --> 31:04.688
Hello?

31:09.432 --> 31:10.999
Oh, my God.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.307
When?

31:28.974 --> 31:29.191
.

31:31.933 --> 31:34.196
Great, thank you, Trev.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.807
- These are your...
- Those are my files.

31:36.851 --> 31:38.722
- Yes.
- Yeah, I can see that.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.507
Will that be all, Dr. Frome?

31:40.550 --> 31:42.552
Trevor, come on, man.

31:42.596 --> 31:44.424
Come on.
It's--it's me, all right?

31:44.467 --> 31:46.948
No--no harm, no foul.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.254
Are you sure?

31:48.297 --> 31:50.212
- Yes, I'm sure.
I'm positive.

31:50.256 --> 31:52.606
You are not
a home wrecker, okay?

31:52.649 --> 31:54.216
You're not.
I'm a big boy.

31:54.260 --> 31:55.435
All right,
I've been in a happy,

31:55.478 --> 31:57.263
wonderful marriage
for over 15 years.

31:57.306 --> 32:00.831
I feel like you're suppressing
your true self.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.007
You certain?

32:02.050 --> 32:03.922
- As you were,
Captain, all right?

32:03.965 --> 32:05.749
- Thank you, Dr. Frome--Iggy.

32:05.793 --> 32:07.229
- Yeah.

32:07.273 --> 32:10.276
You're welcome, Trev.
Now, come on, skedaddle.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.062
Your husband is very lucky

32:14.106 --> 32:16.456
to have someone
as special as you.

32:16.499 --> 32:19.459
- Yeah, I'm--
I'm the lucky one, actually.

32:19.502 --> 32:22.157
- If only I met you
15 years earlier.

33:19.214 --> 33:20.346
Mm.

34:04.825 --> 34:06.348
Adam.

35:57.242 --> 35:59.679
What's wrong?

36:02.856 --> 36:06.120
It's not, uh...

36:06.164 --> 36:07.600
it's not good news.

36:12.344 --> 36:15.869
The crush injuries
were too severe.

36:15.912 --> 36:20.178
We tried to remove all
the damaged tissue, but we...

36:22.005 --> 36:23.746
We couldn't.

36:26.140 --> 36:30.623
So your body is failing, and...

36:32.233 --> 36:36.411
There is nothing more
we can do.

36:41.068 --> 36:42.852
How long?

36:51.470 --> 36:53.123
There's a high probability

36:53.167 --> 36:54.864
that you won't make it
through the night.

36:54.908 --> 36:58.346
Oh, God.

36:58.390 --> 37:00.696
Oh, God, no.
Please, no.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.047
- I'm gonna give you two
some time.

37:04.091 --> 37:06.267
No, I can't...

37:09.749 --> 37:10.924
I love you.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.581
I love you.

37:26.809 --> 37:28.637
Floyd, Floyd.

37:28.681 --> 37:30.857
You're not gonna believe this,
but we found it.

37:30.900 --> 37:32.250
The gene?

37:32.293 --> 37:34.295
- Thiamine metabolism
dysfunction syndrome,

37:34.339 --> 37:36.166
just like her brother
had ten years ago.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.516
That's curable.

37:37.559 --> 37:39.126
- Yeah, just a dose
of thiamine once a day.

37:39.169 --> 37:40.519
I mean, I can't believe
we found it.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.347
well, I mean, my eyes were
going numb

37:42.390 --> 37:44.044
from just lines of ATGC,

37:44.087 --> 37:46.742
but now Tiya's going to get
to live a normal life.

37:46.786 --> 37:50.311
And you know how much I hate
this word, but it's a miracle.

37:53.314 --> 37:54.315
What's wrong?

37:56.839 --> 37:58.667
Where's Tiya now?

37:58.711 --> 38:00.060
NICU.

38:14.857 --> 38:16.946
Look who it is.

38:16.990 --> 38:19.340
Baby girl, yeah.

38:23.126 --> 38:25.346
Hey, little bit.

38:27.217 --> 38:28.654
Hey.

38:52.852 --> 38:53.809
Hey.

38:53.853 --> 38:56.159
Wait, just--

38:56.203 --> 38:57.944
- I told you
I don't want to see you,

38:57.987 --> 39:00.076
but you continue to call me.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.731
You text me.
You ambush me.

39:02.775 --> 39:04.516
I know, I know.

39:05.952 --> 39:07.475
I upended your life.

39:07.519 --> 39:11.784
I violated your trust,
your boundaries.

39:11.827 --> 39:14.526
I tried to control you
with money.

39:17.093 --> 39:19.400
And I'm probably gonna regret

39:19.444 --> 39:21.446
losing you
for the rest of my life.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.927
But I'm not trying
to change it.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.715
I'm trying to atone for it.

39:33.196 --> 39:36.896
You shouldn't have to leave
this place because of me.

39:36.939 --> 39:40.203
Your residency spot
is still open.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.038
I can't work
with you, Lauren.

39:53.216 --> 39:55.305
You won't have to.

39:56.655 --> 39:58.308
I'm the one who's leaving.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.712
- Yeah, hi. Come in.

40:10.756 --> 40:13.323
Just heading out for the day.

40:13.367 --> 40:15.064
Hey.

40:15.108 --> 40:17.284
Ella?

40:17.327 --> 40:19.286
Hi.

40:24.117 --> 40:27.294
What?
What's wrong?

40:29.078 --> 40:31.429
- It's Vijay.
He...

40:32.430 --> 40:34.649
- He...
- No.

40:34.693 --> 40:35.998
No.

40:38.218 --> 40:40.307
No.

40:42.483 --> 40:45.355
- No, no, no,
no, no, no.

40:45.399 --> 40:48.446
Oh. Oh, no.

41:41.368 --> 41:42.891
You heard?

41:44.502 --> 41:46.199
- You heard?
- Yeah.

41:46.242 --> 41:48.984
What a sight for sore eyes.

41:49.028 --> 41:51.987
- You guys didn't have
to come all this way.

41:52.031 --> 41:53.293
Of course we did.

41:53.336 --> 41:55.164
We're family.
