00:35.880 --> 00:38.679
Hello? Is there anybody in there?

00:39.880 --> 00:42.156
- Stop.
- Is there anybody inside?

00:42.840 --> 00:44.831
Come on, please. Come on.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.517
Is there anybody in there?

00:49.720 --> 00:51.438
- Shit.
- Open this goddamn door,

00:51.520 --> 00:53.750
before I knock it the fuck in.

00:59.840 --> 01:00.955
Is he back yet?

01:03.280 --> 01:06.193
That deadbeat still owes me
from yesterday.

01:07.880 --> 01:11.236
Hey, look,
you got 15 minutes before I call the cops.

01:11.520 --> 01:12.510
Take a bath.

01:50.920 --> 01:51.990
<i>1,</i>
<i>1,</i>

01:53.320 --> 01:58.190
Miss, excuse me. Sweetheart, are you okay?

01:58.560 --> 02:01.393
- Is anyone coming to get you?
- He left me.

02:02.040 --> 02:05.032
Come with me.
This is not a safe neighborhood. Come on.

02:05.120 --> 02:08.715
Come on, come on, come on.
I'm going to take you back to my house.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.518
What's your name, miss?

02:10.600 --> 02:12.273
He said, "This time, Dawn,
it's gonna be different, Dawn.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.109
"This time it will be different."
Now I've been in that shithole for days now.

02:16.240 --> 02:20.871
- Who? Who is it that said this?
- John! My fucking boyfriend!

02:24.360 --> 02:27.113
Mailbox 8860. It's a message from Dawn.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.670
Can you have it read,
"John, it's Dawn. I'm in Hollywood.

02:30.760 --> 02:33.274
"Some Holy Roller found me on the street.
Come fucking get me"?

02:33.360 --> 02:34.395
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am, I won't be able to write...</i>

02:34.480 --> 02:37.871
Okay. How about,
"John, it's Dawn. I'm in Hollywood.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.792
-"Come get me, cocksucker"?
<i>- I'm sorry,</i> but <i>I can't...</i>

02:39.880 --> 02:42.440
<i>All right, can you just tell him
to come get me? I'm in Hollywood.</i>

02:42.520 --> 02:46.036
<i>213-555-7136.</i>

02:54.800 --> 03:00.990
Dawn, this boyfriend of yours, this John.
Talk about your demons. He's bad news.

03:01.120 --> 03:06.320
Look, I'm not going to sit here
and rattle on and on about Satan and drugs

03:06.400 --> 03:07.834
-and spiritual...
- Do you have any beer?

03:07.920 --> 03:12.551
Dawn, you are in grave danger.
Are you gonna see this guy again?

03:13.120 --> 03:16.238
- That sounds like his car. Did he call?
- Dawn...

03:20.280 --> 03:22.715
Sally, thank you so much
for your help and stuff. Seriously I...

03:22.800 --> 03:25.679
Look, you have my number.
Call me if anything...

03:25.760 --> 03:28.354
Hey, babe.
Dawn, I was so worried about you.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.113
Yeah, I'm sure you were fucking worried.
What the fuck?

03:30.200 --> 03:31.998
- You just fucking left me there again!
- I'm so sorry.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.559
- Again, John!
- Sorry, excuse me.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.598
- John, What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Are you gonna be all right, Dawn?

03:36.680 --> 03:39.274
What the fuck is that?
Leaving me there again!

03:39.360 --> 03:41.476
Sorry, sorry. Domestic squabble.
Could we have a minute?

03:44.680 --> 03:47.479
You hold on for a second, mister,
'cause you are not off the hook yet, okay?

03:47.560 --> 03:48.675
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.036
No, no, no. John, seriously.
I was fucking scared.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.633
Yeah, let's have a chat, okay?
Let's have a talk.

03:52.720 --> 03:53.710
- Okay.
- Good?

03:53.800 --> 03:55.791
- Yes!
- How about that? Is that okay?

03:55.920 --> 04:00.471
- Holy shit! What is that?
- That's the big one, baby. Didn't I tell you?

04:00.560 --> 04:02.551
- Is it?
- Didn't I say?

04:02.840 --> 04:05.354
"Whatever it takes to get you out of here."

04:05.440 --> 04:09.229
I was gonna do whatever it takes
to get you back.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.319
That's a lot of cocaine.

04:12.400 --> 04:16.029
For the weather. There's a cold front
coming in from the east,

04:16.120 --> 04:18.918
carrying with it anticipation
and heavy skies,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.594
-so strap your skis to the roof of your car...
- Baby, I can't...

04:21.680 --> 04:23.876
...'cause it looks like snow.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.710
- Mountains and mountains...
- And mountains...

04:26.800 --> 04:28.359
...of snow. Okay?

04:31.880 --> 04:35.236
- Shit! Fuck, that's pretty fucking good.
- It's only gonna get better.

04:35.320 --> 04:38.039
Now, what do you want, baby?
Tell me what you want.

04:38.120 --> 04:41.192
- I want to do another one of those.
- Okay, okay.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.430
- No.
- No, no, please?

04:42.520 --> 04:43.510
- All right.
- Okay.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.749
- No.
- No, please?

04:44.840 --> 04:46.160
All right.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.710
Yeah!

05:38.800 --> 05:40.791
- Get out of my house!
- Sorry.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.838
You fornicating, evil, little...

05:46.520 --> 05:48.716
I know who you are!

05:50.560 --> 05:52.756
Tarot cards! Tarot cards!

05:58.360 --> 05:59.350
Devil worshipper!

08:08.040 --> 08:09.394
Shit! Billy's already here.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.357
- Look, baby, I'll be back in five minutes.
- But baby...

08:13.080 --> 08:15.276
- What's your favorite ride at Disneyland?
- The Matterhorn, but...

08:15.360 --> 08:18.478
Just keep it there. I'll be back
in five minutes. Just be on the ride.

08:19.320 --> 08:21.436
- Is it in your mind?
- Yeah, I have the...

08:21.560 --> 08:23.278
Yeah, yeah, don't tell me.
Just think about it.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.716
- Okay, I'll be back in one minute.
- But baby! I gotta pee.

08:26.880 --> 08:27.995
Okay.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.394
This sucks.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.310
- Just calm the fuck down, man!
- Shit.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.595
Come here, come here, come here.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.594
- What, baby? What?
- Baby, I'm sorry.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.149
I'm just annoyed I have to do all that stuff.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.277
It's okay, I'll work,
and you know what I mean, I'll just...

09:07.400 --> 09:09.516
- I just want to get you out of here.
- It's okay, I'll work.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.635
You know what I mean? We'll figure it out.

09:10.720 --> 09:14.236
You don't have to work, though,
spending all this cash.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.913
Baby!

09:16.280 --> 09:17.350
- You ready?
- Yeah.

09:17.440 --> 09:18.874
- You ready to hit the town?
- Yeah.

09:18.960 --> 09:22.351
- Shall we? Where do you want to go?
- Anywhere. Everywhere!

09:24.040 --> 09:25.110
Baby!

09:33.960 --> 09:37.316
- Where are we going?
- You know what? Now, we need to talk.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.869
I think we should just be friends
until you're 20.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.030
Fuck you. I hate you.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.315
- Don't you think?
- No.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.390
- You know what?
- What?

09:43.520 --> 09:44.669
- I can't look at you.
- Stop.

09:44.760 --> 09:45.750
- I can't.
- Don't.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.116
- Come on, I can't drive. I can't concentrate.
- Don't, John, don't.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.555
- Can't keep my eyes on the road.
- John, don't!

09:52.720 --> 09:54.677
- I love you.
- I love you.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.399
Where are we going, really?

09:56.480 --> 09:58.630
- I gotta make one stop first, okay?
- No.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.194
- Just one. Yeah, then we'll go.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.393
We've gotta turn what's in that briefcase
into cash, baby.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.560
Come on, baby. Come on, come on.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.070
Oh, man.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.070
John.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.754
Don't go.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.075
Please?

10:56.880 --> 10:58.598
Please stay with me.

11:09.720 --> 11:12.189
Baby, we just hit double zeros,

11:12.760 --> 11:14.910
and we've gotta cash out
before we leave the table, right?

11:18.680 --> 11:20.034
I love you.

11:24.680 --> 11:27.718
That's for you, okay? Baby, lock the door.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.550
Love you. Come here, come here.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.352
- Baby, What's wrong?
- Nothing.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.269
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- What?

13:59.400 --> 14:02.756
- I'm sorry, okay?
- Are you okay?

14:04.400 --> 14:08.871
Where have you been?
Baby, what happened?

14:19.240 --> 14:22.596
Baby, what is that?

14:24.560 --> 14:25.959
An accident.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.354
Are you okay?

14:34.120 --> 14:36.031
There was a car pileup.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.752
- Are you okay?
- There was a car pileup on the 118.

14:41.760 --> 14:45.276
- I'm so sorry I made you wait.
- That's okay.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.672
- So sorry.
- Baby.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.797
- So sorry you ever met me.
- Shut up, don't.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.753
I'm sorry, Dawn.

15:03.960 --> 15:07.032
<i>The Southiand is in shock today

15:07.120 --> 15:09.919

<i>- David. David, is that you?</i>
- Who <i>the</i> fuck survived?

16:41.440 --> 16:43.477
Lind, Jesus, what the fuck?
I'm watching right now.

16:43.560 --> 16:45.710
I need the swag Billy brought over.
I want to buy it all back.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.475
- No, I already unloaded it.
- Damn it, I'm dead. I'm fucking dead.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.279
Listen, whatever's wrong, I'll take care of.
Don't worry.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.830
- Yeah, you gonna take care of Eddie Nash?
- Eddie Nash?

16:56.400 --> 16:59.472
God damn it, keep your mouth shut,
or you're dead. I'll kill you myself.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.710
Listen to me,
you've gotta go to the cops on this one.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.757
- I'm coming over.
- No, no, listen.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.036
- I'II take care of it.
- Are you fucking nuts?

17:06.280 --> 17:08.078
<i>I've got friends over there

17:08.160 --> 17:10.720

<i>Listen to me. Meet me up

17:19.760 --> 17:21.194
Jesus, David.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.115
What did you do?

17:24.200 --> 17:26.555
- Fuck you, motherfucker.
- No witnesses.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.319
David, no!

17:29.760 --> 17:31.637
Are you fucking insane?

17:55.760 --> 17:57.592
Cruz, Robbery Homicide.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.278
Yeah, hold on, yeah.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.110
Yeah.

18:05.680 --> 18:08.672
Yeah, we'll see, we'll see. Right.

18:11.280 --> 18:12.793
Okay, yeah.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.640
All right.

18:17.320 --> 18:18.674
Eddie Nash?

18:18.880 --> 18:21.793
- He owns the Starwood, right?
- Yes, he does.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.120
We're taking a drive.

18:28.200 --> 18:32.080
Eddie Nash.
His real name is Adel Nasrallah.

18:32.400 --> 18:36.553
He steps off the plane from Palestine
in 1953 with nothing.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.916
He's got four shekels and a bag of dirt.

18:39.960 --> 18:43.590
By 1954 he's got a little hotdog cart
on Hollywood Boulevard,

18:43.680 --> 18:48.311
right outside the Seven Seas restaurant.
By 1960 he owns the place.

18:48.400 --> 18:52.155
<i>Now, he parlays the money that he gets
from the Seven Seas into two more places.</i>

18:52.240 --> 18:53.799
<i>They take the fuck off.</i>

18:53.880 --> 18:58.158
By 1969 he's got, like,
20, 25 liquor licenses.

18:58.280 --> 18:59.714
So he's got friends.

18:59.800 --> 19:03.236
Yeah, he's got friends. He's the biggest
nightclub owner in Hollywood.

19:03.320 --> 19:06.438
Here's <i>a guy who has been
under investigation for arson</i>

19:06.520 --> 19:10.150
<i>for the last five years,
yet he still goes out to dinner</i>

19:10.240 --> 19:12.197
<i>with the fire commissioner twice a week.</i>

19:12.280 --> 19:16.433
Rumor has it that he has got 40 acres
in the desert filled with human skulls,

19:16.520 --> 19:19.512
except he's removed the teeth
so we can't identify them.

19:19.600 --> 19:23.434
- Jesus Christ.
- Close. Eddie Nash.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.719
Billy and Joy.

20:01.280 --> 20:05.239
Ronnie, Susan.

20:23.720 --> 20:24.710
Mr. Lind.

20:27.920 --> 20:33.598
- I'm Detective Nico. This is Detective Cruz.
- This one, this one here, did she make it?

20:34.760 --> 20:36.512
Barbara Richardson.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.189
Butterfly.

21:06.440 --> 21:07.669
Mr. Lind.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.509
Mr. Lind.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.790
Should we go in there?

21:36.320 --> 21:37.469
Okay.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.151
You guys want to hear a story?

21:48.280 --> 21:50.749
This whole thing started with guns.

21:51.200 --> 21:54.272
Four antique guns
that Ron Launius couldn't fence.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.510
Ron Launius was your friend?

21:58.040 --> 22:01.237
- We were in business together.
- What kind of business?

22:02.600 --> 22:04.830
You know,
you guys haven't read me my rights.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.638
Nothing I tell you is admissible.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.433
We just want to hear your story, Dave,
all right?

22:09.080 --> 22:10.400
All right.

22:11.360 --> 22:14.910
I met Ron Launius in Chino. In 1973.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.277
We stayed tight.
A few months ago he and Billy

22:18.360 --> 22:21.478
came up to Sacramento to see me.
They had a small operation down here

22:21.560 --> 22:24.598
-in LA. that was really starting to cook
- Drugs?

22:27.000 --> 22:31.392
- Now, he and Billy Deverell were partners?
- Yep. Ran it right out of the house.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.719
3678 Wonderland.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.275
Billy...

22:38.080 --> 22:42.153
Billy was a good old boy.
Solid. Dependable.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.198
He wanted to get out of the life,
but the life was just too good.

22:49.920 --> 22:50.910
Baby doll.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.435
<i>You see, they were getting large quantities
of shit, dirt cheap.</i>

22:53.520 --> 22:56.876
<i>Stepping on it five, six times,
then dumping it all over town.</i>

22:56.960 --> 22:58.234
Heads up, dickheads.

22:58.320 --> 23:01.153
<i>Business was so good
that they needed an extra hand,</i>

23:01.240 --> 23:04.073
<i>which is where Barbara and I start out.</i>

23:05.560 --> 23:08.598
<i>When we pulled up,
the party was in full swing.</i>

23:08.840 --> 23:11.673
<i>Bodies everywhere. 1 mean,
it was the kind of place that made you think</i>

23:11.760 --> 23:14.593
<i>you were right back in the Summer of Love.</i>

23:15.320 --> 23:18.312
<i>Me and Barb had been on the road
all daylong,</i>

23:18.600 --> 23:21.752
<i>and all I could think about
was a place to crash.</i>

23:22.560 --> 23:26.519
<i>But when I walked up the stairs,
I saw all the old friends,</i>

23:27.680 --> 23:29.239
<i>all the smiles.</i>

23:30.480 --> 23:33.279
<i>God damn,
it made me feel good to be home.</i>

23:45.920 --> 23:49.470
Davey! Yes, brother, so good to see you.

23:49.560 --> 23:50.834
<i>I saw Cherokee straight off.</i>

23:50.920 --> 23:51.876
Welcome home!

23:51.960 --> 23:55.191
<i>He was one of Ronnie's boys.
He set me up, he set me walking.</i>

23:55.280 --> 24:00.593
Right this way, my man, right this way.
Follow me right up here. Hey, baby!

24:00.680 --> 24:05.470
<i>There was Billy and his wife, Joy.
It was her place.</i>

24:07.360 --> 24:10.955
<i>She had just beaten breast cancer
and found a new lease on life.</i>

24:11.040 --> 24:13.316
- This is Barbara.
- Hi.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.676
<i>She was a real generous woman.</i>

24:18.920 --> 24:21.833
- Nice, thank you.
- Barbara?

24:21.920 --> 24:24.992
- Where is he?
- Right up there, my brother.

24:25.280 --> 24:29.274
<i>Ronnie was in the back.
That's when I first saw the antique guns.</i>

24:32.440 --> 24:36.354
- Hey, my man.
- Yeah, feel free to enjoy, man.

24:39.800 --> 24:40.995
Ronnie!

24:45.040 --> 24:46.189
Davey.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.439
He was fearless.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.438
He was the kind of guy,
you put a gun to his head

24:53.520 --> 24:55.352
and his pulse wouldn't break 70.

24:55.440 --> 24:59.957
Is it hot in here, 'cause I'm roasting.
Summer, baby, bummer!

25:00.240 --> 25:04.279
Hey, you think it's hot in here?
I saw The Dead play Grass Valley...

25:04.360 --> 25:06.795
You must be Barbara.
Are you enjoying yourself?

25:06.880 --> 25:08.996
Yeah, it's the best party I've ever been to.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.799
Well, it's only the beginning, baby.
LA. in the summer,

25:11.880 --> 25:13.996
anything can happen, right?

25:14.920 --> 25:18.276
How you doing, man?
You see my new toys? Check these out.

25:19.600 --> 25:22.558
- Are these for real?
- Yeah, I got two more in the bed, man.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.472
Guns like these
are worth a lot of money, Ronnie.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.233
That's why I can't find a fence, brother.

25:27.960 --> 25:31.271
- What about Slim Jim?
- No, no, he said they're too high profile.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.395
Hey.

25:34.560 --> 25:35.550
Where are we sleeping?

25:37.960 --> 25:42.113
Did you see the couch when you walked in?
That's where you're sleeping.

25:42.200 --> 25:46.592
I just wanted to be alone with Barbara,
you know, spend some quiet time.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.629
God damn, she was happy to be there.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.193
<i>She had never been south of Bakersfield.</i>

25:59.640 --> 26:01.438
<i>There she was in LA.</i>

26:02.360 --> 26:05.273
<i>Because I told her
she could be Lana Turner,</i>

26:05.960 --> 26:07.553
<i>or Barbara Eden,</i>

26:11.320 --> 26:13.118
<i>and she believed me.</i>

26:17.040 --> 26:18.838
<i>This is so fucked up.</i>

26:20.200 --> 26:21.998
This is so fucked up.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.829
- Where was I?
- You were at a party.

26:37.640 --> 26:38.755
Yeah.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.516
That's when I first met him.

26:43.480 --> 26:46.120
- He was talking to Ronnie.
-...so rich.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.559
- Ronnie.
- Yeah.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.596
John Holmes, this is my business partner,
David Lind.

26:52.680 --> 26:53.715
Hey, what's up?

26:53.840 --> 26:58.437
- Now, the deal with the Arab...
- John, this is my business partner, Dave.

26:59.680 --> 27:03.389
Cool. Hey. So, I was just telling Ronnie
about this business proposition I got

27:03.480 --> 27:05.676
about this Arab,
who's a really wealthy businessman,

27:05.760 --> 27:08.912
he calls me his brother,
and he literally has mountains of cash,

27:09.000 --> 27:09.990
-and drugs.
<i>- Wait a minute.</i>

27:10.520 --> 27:13.990
- John Holmes? The John Holmes?
- Yeah.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.359
Johnny Wadd partied at Wonderland?

27:16.440 --> 27:19.831
All the time. The guy is a fucking cokehead.

27:20.080 --> 27:23.869
- He's up to his neck in the shit.
- All right, who's John Holmes?

27:23.960 --> 27:27.351
The porn king. Sam, the guy's a legend.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.070
Never heard of him.

27:32.880 --> 27:36.714
I knew who he was, but I wasn't
gonna make a big thing out of it.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.831
You know? He blew me off, too.

27:38.920 --> 27:41.799
Ron, I'm not fucking lying, man.
Just hear me out...

27:41.880 --> 27:43.359
- Are you John Holmes?
- No.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.192
Come on, John, don't lie to her.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.352
- What's your name, baby?
- Janet

27:47.960 --> 27:49.314
You want to see it?

27:50.400 --> 27:51.549
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

27:52.960 --> 27:54.678
- Show her, John.
- Ron, stop.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.319
Show her,

27:56.400 --> 27:58.960
-or I'll fucking shoot it, man.
- Look, man, that could be loaded.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.035
Fuck!

28:02.800 --> 28:04.473
I'II fucking shoot it, man.

28:08.880 --> 28:09.870
Wow.

28:11.880 --> 28:14.554
- Can I touch it?
- Yeah, baby, go ahead.

28:19.160 --> 28:21.231
Enjoy your evening, ladies.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.072
Put it in your pants, John.

28:27.480 --> 28:30.393
The whole party didn't come
to see your cock.

28:30.560 --> 28:31.880
I don't understand.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.314
Why did John Holmes
hang out at Wonderland?

28:33.440 --> 28:36.239
He burnt every other drug dealer in town.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.431
Ronnie was the only guy
who would let him hang out.

28:38.520 --> 28:42.309
John is a scumbag. Stone thief.
The guy is bad news.

28:44.080 --> 28:47.198
But Ronnie, he liked the novelty,

28:47.880 --> 28:50.793
and John, he liked our drugs.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.958
Baby, I need a hit real bad.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.829
I made the calls.
There's nothing around until the weekend.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.389
Yeah, I can't wait that long.
Did you talk to Diaz?

29:01.480 --> 29:04.552
- Nobody's holding.
- I know a gal out in Tarzana

29:04.840 --> 29:07.434
-who might be able to make a phone call.
- Works at Captain Pizza?

29:07.520 --> 29:09.875
Fucking pizza joint, man?
You think I want some fucking pizza?

29:09.960 --> 29:10.995
You think I'm hungry?

29:11.440 --> 29:14.193
What the fuck, man? The only thing
I want right now is some dope, man.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.634
The Arab's got some China White.

29:15.720 --> 29:19.236
<i>L.A. was dry, no one was holding,
but Ronnie was looking for a long shot,</i>

29:19.360 --> 29:22.478
-he was dope sick.
- So, the Arab was Eddie Nash?

29:22.720 --> 29:25.473
Yeah, but I didn't realize that fill later.
But I'll get to that.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.471
<i>So Holmes offers to do us a favor.</i>

29:27.560 --> 29:29.710
<i>He says he'll take Ronnie's antique guns
up to the Arab</i>

29:29.800 --> 29:33.156
<i>to trade for as much China and blow
as he could get.</i>

29:33.240 --> 29:35.470
<i>Sounded like a good plan,
but only he's gone eight hours.</i>

29:36.520 --> 29:40.753
Finally, he comes back in, high as a kite,
empty-handed, of course he has a story.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.918
Where is he, man? It's a 10-minute drive.
I'm gonna kill this snake.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.991
The guy's a basehead, Ronnie.
What do you want?

29:48.160 --> 29:49.150
Did you get it?

29:49.240 --> 29:52.710
Man. The Arab was, like, crazy-man psycho.

29:52.800 --> 29:55.599
He's basing for three days straight.
He keeps me prisoner, man.

29:55.680 --> 29:58.115
- He fucking stole the guns...
- Bullshit, you scumbag!

29:58.200 --> 29:59.599
Why would I come up
with a lame-ass story like that?

29:59.680 --> 30:02.911
- Ron, Ron, Ron!
- Ronnie, Ronnie, no! Not in my house!

30:07.680 --> 30:11.275
It was bullshit! Ronnie was furious.
Billy gave John...

30:11.360 --> 30:15.240
Two days. You have two days.
The money or the guns in two days.

30:15.520 --> 30:19.514
And next time, I ain't gonna worry
about your brains on my walls.

30:19.760 --> 30:21.990
Now get the fuck out of here.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.120
Needless to say, we didn't see John
for the next couple of weeks.

30:31.200 --> 30:34.955
I figure we'll never see him again.
But two weeks later...

30:35.200 --> 30:36.873
So, Susan's coming down.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.633
- Your wife?
- Yeah, next week, man.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.473
- She's not gonna bug us?
- No, no, Dave, it's...

30:41.560 --> 30:42.880
Holy shit.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.438
Look who just walked in.

30:46.720 --> 30:47.994
Hey, John.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.155
I found something big for you.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.151
I'm gonna whack this motherfuck right now!

30:57.240 --> 30:59.914
Look, I was at the Arab's last Tuesday.

31:02.360 --> 31:06.399
- Do you even know who the Arab is?
- Who gives a shit? Half a million.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.555
A half a million dollars in loot.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.035
And I'm still thinking,
"This is still just some fence

31:16.120 --> 31:18.111
"this shithead has been feeding on."

31:20.440 --> 31:21.794
I had no idea.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.072
You didn't know that the Arab
was Eddie Nash?

31:24.160 --> 31:25.150
No, not then.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.992
Come on, David.
You had to have had an idea.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.959
None! I mean, I figured it was junk talk.

31:30.760 --> 31:33.320
You know, the big score, long-time money.
You know the bullshit.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.549
Right.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.472
It's like clockwork.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.678
He's still got most of his take
before it goes out,

31:39.760 --> 31:42.149
and all the next month's shit
coming in at the same time.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.756
- That's two months' worth.
- I don't buy it.

31:44.960 --> 31:47.429
- It's a gold mine.
- You got a plan?

31:48.480 --> 31:52.189
What, we're just supposed to bust in there
like The Guns of Navarone?

31:52.280 --> 31:53.554
I can draw you a map.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.030
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. He drew you a map?
- Yeah.

31:56.120 --> 31:59.112
<i>He offered to leave the kitchen door
unlocked for us so we could break in.</i>

32:00.640 --> 32:04.031
How many times you been
in the house, John? Twenty? Thirty?

32:04.920 --> 32:07.389
I've been going there for two,
three years, man. Dude calls me "Brother."

32:07.480 --> 32:10.871
<i>That closed it for Ronnie.
I could see it in his eyes.</i>

32:11.640 --> 32:13.438
<i>He made his decision.</i>

32:14.160 --> 32:16.993
<i>We went, cased the place. I didn't like it.</i>

32:20.000 --> 32:22.958
<i>The house came right up
to the property line.</i>

32:23.160 --> 32:25.993
<i>But John...
John was so fucking convincing.</i>

32:26.320 --> 32:30.075
The more he said was there,
the more Ronnie wanted to do it.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.153
I told him to forget about it.

32:32.320 --> 32:37.315
Listen, man. Call it off.
You got Susan down here. Chill out.

32:38.120 --> 32:42.478
- Spend some time, work things out.
- We are gonna work things out, Dave.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.833
On a beach, man.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.069
In Maui.

32:47.240 --> 32:48.833
<i>But like I said,</i>

32:49.800 --> 32:52.838
he made his decision.
I figured, if he was gonna go,

32:53.520 --> 32:55.193
I better go
and make sure nothing happened.

32:56.240 --> 33:00.473
Okay, let's just back up for a second.
When did Susan Launius arrive?

33:01.240 --> 33:02.594
Sometime Sunday.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.193
<i>She and Ronnie
were having some problems,</i>

33:04.280 --> 33:05.953
<i>so she flew down to patch things up.</i>

33:06.040 --> 33:07.360
All right.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.874
Come here.

33:12.840 --> 33:15.514
You look so good. I'll get the other...

33:36.520 --> 33:38.193
Ron, what is this?

33:38.760 --> 33:41.229
God damn it, Ron, you told me
that it was gonna be different this time.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.833
- Hey, calm down.
- You fucking told me that.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.797
Calm down, I don't want
to start like this again, all right?

33:44.880 --> 33:46.837
You fucking told me
that you were clean, Ron.

33:46.960 --> 33:48.280
I am clean, all right?

33:48.760 --> 33:51.115
- Cleaner.
- You looked me right in the fucking eye

33:51.200 --> 33:52.679
-and you promised me...
- I don't want to start like this.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.791
-...it was gonna be different.
- I don't want to start like this!

33:54.880 --> 33:56.518
We start like this every fucking time.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.069
Please just take me home.
Please take me home.

33:59.160 --> 34:02.073
I don't want to be here.
Please take me home.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.353
Early that afternoon,
Ron gave John some dough

34:06.480 --> 34:09.916
to go to the Arab's to score some dope
and to leave the kitchen door unlocked.

34:11.159 --> 34:12.514
Hey, John.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.753
Kitchen door, man.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.351
Hey, it's all right.

35:04.320 --> 35:06.357
<i>It took him three trips to get it done.</i>

35:06.440 --> 35:09.637
<i>Finally, about 4:00 in the morning,
he shows up, says the Arab's asleep.</i>

35:10.080 --> 35:12.196
<i>It's all clear, I was ready to go.</i>

35:16.960 --> 35:18.712
- Get him.
- All right.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.630
You fucking honk twice
if you see anything.

35:21.720 --> 35:22.915
Sounds easy enough, boss.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.832
- Rock and roll.
- I need a snack first.

35:29.480 --> 35:33.917
- Wait, you got high during the robbery?
- Not me. Never when I'm working.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.759
Come on. What do you think...

35:35.840 --> 35:38.958
No, hang on, hang on, hang on.
David, when did you get to the house?

35:41.360 --> 35:42.589
Around 8:00 in the morning.

35:43.560 --> 35:44.914
<i>We entered through the kitchen door.</i>

35:45.000 --> 35:48.197
<i>It was unlocked,
just like John said it would be.</i>

36:02.520 --> 36:03.510
On the carpet!

36:04.280 --> 36:05.998
Freeze, motherfucker!

36:07.200 --> 36:09.919
Get down or I'll fucking waste you! Now!

36:13.320 --> 36:16.199
Bite the fucking carpet!
Get down on the ground, you fuck!

36:38.720 --> 36:39.710
You shot him?

36:39.880 --> 36:43.111
Grazed him accidentally
when Ronnie bumped into me.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.399
You grazed him?

36:46.400 --> 36:48.198
It was a flesh wound.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.154
What the fuck are you doing, Ronnie?

36:50.240 --> 36:52.595
What the fuck, man?
Now everyone knows we're fucking here!

36:54.320 --> 36:56.834
- What the fuck?
- Who the fuck cares? Who the fuck cares?

36:56.920 --> 36:58.991
Give me your fucking hands.
Give me your fucking hands.

36:59.080 --> 37:01.594
Come on! Just get up and get to the safe.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.917
- Let's go, Ronnie!
- All right. Give me your other fucking hand.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.559
I don't want to die. Please don't kill me.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.200
<i>We left Billy downstairs,
went up the stairs for the safe.</i>

37:08.280 --> 37:11.875
<i>John had told us
that there was a safe underneath the bed.</i>

37:13.440 --> 37:14.919
Where the fuck is it, huh?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.035
- Eddie?
- What the fuck?

37:16.120 --> 37:18.270
There's no need for violence.
I'll tell you whatever you want.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.033
There'll be no violence
if you tell me the fucking truth.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.269
Nothing in there.

37:24.520 --> 37:25.590
What the fuck is the combination?

37:25.720 --> 37:28.519
There's nothing in there.
Nothing in that safe.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.278
You open your fucking mouth

37:30.360 --> 37:33.318
and tell me the fucking combination
to the safe, motherfucker.

37:33.640 --> 37:34.835
Tell me the combination.

37:36.120 --> 37:40.478
Eighty-six, 25, 60.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.158
Where in the fuck is the rest of it?

37:50.240 --> 37:52.197
I will blow your fucking head off,
so help me, God,

37:52.280 --> 37:53.315
if you don't fucking tell me.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.829
All the drugs are at the Starwood.

37:57.520 --> 37:58.954
<i>Then it hit me.</i>

37:59.400 --> 38:01.391
This was Eddie Nash.

38:01.480 --> 38:04.393
We were hitting Eddie fucking Nash,
and we were screwed.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.118
I mean, if I had known it was Nash...

38:06.480 --> 38:09.757
Look, look, I know who Eddie Nash is.
So does Detective Cruz.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.160
Just go on with the story.

38:11.320 --> 38:15.393
<i>We took the place apart,
found as much as we could, and split.</i>

38:53.760 --> 38:57.549
- And where was Mr. Holmes during all this?
- He was waiting back at the house.

38:57.640 --> 39:02.510
I told Ronnie in the car to keep things cool,
but Bigmouth couldn't wait to talk.

39:04.320 --> 39:06.391
They're here! They're here!

39:11.240 --> 39:13.550
You are not gonna believe
how much shit we got.

39:13.640 --> 39:14.789
- How much did you get?
- Guess.

39:14.880 --> 39:15.836
Everything?
- Yeah.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.275
- Even the safe?
- Yeah. Yeah.

39:20.560 --> 39:23.916
I knew there was money there. Yeah!

39:49.080 --> 39:50.593
Deal With this.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.272
I got my guns back!

40:15.600 --> 40:19.230
-$1.2 million. Not bad.
- It was a good score.

40:20.120 --> 40:23.317
- And nobody got hurt.
- Okay. What's next?

40:23.760 --> 40:25.876
<i>Holmes immediately starts bitching
about his share.</i>

40:25.960 --> 40:28.873
He was only in for an eighth cut,
and all of a sudden he wanted more.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.871
What, are you fucking kidding me?
This is not my cut.

40:30.960 --> 40:33.076
Scumbag tax. Now we're even.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.949
- Even for what?
- For the guns, John.

40:36.320 --> 40:38.880
- But we got the guns back!
- No, I got the guns back.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.031
You still owe us
for all the coke you smoked.

40:41.120 --> 40:44.033
Ronnie, come on.
I got editors that I have to pay.

40:44.120 --> 40:46.077
I have deadlines. This is not my final cut.

40:46.160 --> 40:47.195
I don't know
what you want me to say, John.

40:47.280 --> 40:50.079
I want you to say that I can have my cut!

40:56.240 --> 41:00.199
- Okay, okay, how about the gems?
- You want to wait for the gems?

41:01.160 --> 41:04.710
Fine. Joy and I are gonna
take them down to Slim's, fence them.

41:05.200 --> 41:08.989
- Then you can get your cut.
- There it is, John. That's it.

41:10.680 --> 41:13.035
So, Holmes set it up, and he felt entitled.

41:13.440 --> 41:16.751
We took all the risks.
He sat home with the girls.

41:18.440 --> 41:23.116
At this point,
I decided to treat myself to a shot of H.

41:24.120 --> 41:28.000
You know,
a little reward for a job well done.

41:32.920 --> 41:33.910
<i>After that it's...</i>

41:36.680 --> 41:38.398
<i>It's kind of a blur.</i>

41:39.360 --> 41:42.591
Mailbox 8860. Password, "Palm tree."

42:11.880 --> 42:14.793
There's your cut from the gems, man.
Now get the fuck out of here.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.154
You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.311
I'm not fucking kidding, John.
Get the fuck out of here.

42:18.400 --> 42:21.518
- Ron, I...
- You think I give a shit that...

42:24.560 --> 42:25.675
We're all fucking sick of you!

42:25.760 --> 42:28.070
I got a fucking deadline!
Why can't you just hear me out on this?

42:28.160 --> 42:30.959
- You...
- I'm just saying that's not my plan!

42:31.040 --> 42:32.997
- I'm fucking sick of this shit!
- You know what? Fucking...

42:33.080 --> 42:34.070
Get the fuck out of here!

42:36.640 --> 42:38.119
- Get the fuck out, man!
- I'm just saying...

42:38.240 --> 42:41.995
- Where's your fucking gun, David?
- It's cool, man. I'm going.

42:47.280 --> 42:52.673
That's fucking great. Fuck, man.
I'm so fucking sick of that fucking guy.

42:53.480 --> 42:54.675
Are you gonna fucking fix that?

42:54.800 --> 42:57.110
- How am I explaining that to...
- We got enough fucking money to fix it.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.679
We'll fix it.

42:59.280 --> 43:00.475
I left the next day.

43:00.560 --> 43:03.871
I had to go to the Sac,
do overnight for this thing.

43:04.960 --> 43:08.794
I left Barbara there.
When I saw the news on the television...

43:09.760 --> 43:11.797
- It had to be Holmes.
- Why?

43:15.920 --> 43:17.069
Hello?

43:17.880 --> 43:20.918
Joey. Joey, look, man,
it's not a good time right now.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.957
Yeah, Joey, hold on. Talk to Billy, all right?

43:24.000 --> 43:25.957
Hey, man, what's up? Yeah, no bullshit.

43:26.280 --> 43:29.318
We're closed for the day. Yeah.
All right, man.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.073
All right, listen up.
From here on out, we keep a low profile.

43:35.320 --> 43:37.755
Billy was very specific.

43:38.160 --> 43:39.992
No deals in the house.

43:40.120 --> 43:43.158
Everything happens
down at the Canyon store. I mean it.

43:43.240 --> 43:45.834
No one in the house but inner circle.

43:46.160 --> 43:49.312
No one gets buzzed up
unless I say it's okay.

43:51.520 --> 43:56.515
- Hey, Holmes, are you listening to me?
- It's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool.

43:56.880 --> 43:58.518
And with the security gate, there's no way

43:58.600 --> 44:01.797
anybody could have gotten in there
without knowing Billy personally.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.789
John was the only one
who knew about the Nash hit.

44:07.040 --> 44:13.195
That piece of shit ratted us out,
let Nash in and got my Butterfly killed.

44:16.880 --> 44:17.631
- You guys are out of your minds.
- Come on.

44:17.720 --> 44:20.758
Let's bring in Nash, Captain.
He killed them, plain as day.

44:20.840 --> 44:23.275
Cruz, this whole thing is circumstantial,
and you know it.

44:23.360 --> 44:27.240
- We've brought in people with a lot less.
- You're talking about Eddie Nash.

44:27.320 --> 44:29.630
You don't bring him in
till you got an eyewitness.

44:29.720 --> 44:32.599
What do you know?
Some junkies robbed Eddie Nash?

44:32.680 --> 44:36.389
No, it's bullshit. Find John Holmes.

44:36.840 --> 44:39.992
If he tells you that Eddie Nash
picked up a pipe and swung it,

44:40.080 --> 44:41.593
maybe we'll arrest him.

44:43.800 --> 44:48.636
- All right, come on.
- Gonna nail Eddie Nash. Fucking crazy.

44:57.240 --> 44:59.117
Can I have a cigarette?

45:04.040 --> 45:05.360
Thank you.

45:07.240 --> 45:10.756
It's all over the news
that four people are dead. John.

45:14.880 --> 45:15.915
Wow.

45:19.160 --> 45:20.230
Four?

45:23.240 --> 45:26.153
- How long have I been out?
- For, like, a day.

45:26.560 --> 45:28.198
John, you've taken me up
to that street before.

45:28.280 --> 45:30.351
There was the house, John.

45:32.040 --> 45:34.236
- You know, the house.
- Really?

45:42.280 --> 45:45.557
You had a nightmare.
You were screaming about blood.

45:45.680 --> 45:48.069
You were screaming in your sleep.

45:49.280 --> 45:52.318
Yeah, I had a... My nose...

45:53.960 --> 45:57.749
On the trunk. I hit my nose on the...
The trunk on my nose.

45:59.080 --> 46:01.799
LAPD, freeze! In the air, in the air!
Hands in the air!

46:20.880 --> 46:22.154
Okay, Dawn.

46:22.840 --> 46:25.309
I've got some photographs
I'd like you to look at.

46:25.640 --> 46:27.677
You ever seen that house?

46:30.480 --> 46:31.515
No.

46:32.840 --> 46:34.274
Are you sure?

46:39.240 --> 46:41.470
All right. How about here?

46:49.480 --> 46:50.550
Nope.

46:53.920 --> 46:55.319
Let me see.

46:56.680 --> 46:59.672
- More fucking blue.
- Baby.

47:02.120 --> 47:05.670
Say your name.
"My name is Gabrielle." Say it.

47:05.880 --> 47:07.632
- My name is Gabrielle.
- Say it.

47:07.760 --> 47:09.353
My name... Hi, my name is...

47:09.800 --> 47:12.838
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I'm sorry, John! God, John, Jesus Christ!

47:12.920 --> 47:15.514
- Fucking shut up!
- Oh, my God, my name is Gabrielle.

47:15.600 --> 47:19.594
Pay attention and be real.
He will cut your fucking head off

47:19.920 --> 47:22.719
and take you to the desert and bury you.

47:23.680 --> 47:26.069
- I know that!
- Just look in the mirror.

47:26.160 --> 47:27.992
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Just look in the mirror.

47:28.080 --> 47:31.391
- Just look in the minor. Look in the minor.

47:32.800 --> 47:35.553
- What's your name?
- My name is Gabrielle.

47:36.160 --> 47:37.639
Take a deep breath. It's just a thing.

47:37.720 --> 47:40.473
It's just a thing. I've been with a thousand
women, they didn't mean anything.

47:40.560 --> 47:44.918
- I don't want to go.
- You don't have to go if you don't want to.

47:45.880 --> 47:48.076
You don't have to go. Fuck it.

47:57.160 --> 48:00.118
Just go... Baby, just go and say hi.
Just, like, 10 minutes.

48:00.200 --> 48:03.591
- Uckyou.
- It's justwe owe him so much money, baby.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.752
You look beautiful.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.799
No, it's okay.

48:15.760 --> 48:17.592
Do you know that guy?

48:29.160 --> 48:30.195
No.

48:36.960 --> 48:38.792
Merry Christmas, baby.

48:42.560 --> 48:43.630
Nash.

48:56.440 --> 48:58.670
So, what do you want me to do?

49:00.040 --> 49:02.156
I want you to dance for me.

49:06.800 --> 49:09.235
You mean just, like... Just dance?

49:11.480 --> 49:12.629
Dance.

49:47.760 --> 49:50.513
Dawn? Dawn?

49:52.440 --> 49:55.876
Dawn, I was wrong. I was wrong.
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

50:01.880 --> 50:03.234
Come closer.

50:12.160 --> 50:14.276
Oh, no, no, no, no.

50:15.240 --> 50:18.870
No, no, I was wrong. I'm sorry, baby.

50:26.200 --> 50:27.429
Touch me.

50:44.320 --> 50:46.197
You've never seen him?

50:48.880 --> 50:51.952
I think I'd remember
meeting somebody like that.

50:52.800 --> 50:53.915
Don't you?

50:55.480 --> 50:56.595
Okay.

50:58.640 --> 51:02.110
This is my partner, Louis Cruz.
He's gonna give you a ride home, okay?

51:55.440 --> 51:57.954
Just keep scrubbing, it'll rub off.

52:17.880 --> 52:19.917
You know I'm sorry, right?

52:24.640 --> 52:25.914
You ready?

52:27.360 --> 52:29.317
Do you have any place to go?

52:50.760 --> 52:52.080
Excuse me, miss,
do you want me to go with you?

52:52.160 --> 52:53.673
No, no, no, no, that's cool.

52:53.760 --> 52:55.797
- You sure?
- Yes, thank you.

53:15.040 --> 53:17.111
I have no place else to go.

53:18.200 --> 53:20.111
Okay. All right, come in.

53:20.200 --> 53:21.838
Miss Holmes, you sure you don't need me
to come inside?

53:21.920 --> 53:24.036
No, we're good. No, no. Thank you.

53:30.080 --> 53:31.195
Okay.

53:31.920 --> 53:35.117
- I'm really not that hungry.
- Well, you eat, sweetie.

53:35.200 --> 53:39.751
Worst decision a person can make
is to make a decision on an empty stomach.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.389
<i>...connection with
the Laurel Canyon murders.</i>

53:42.480 --> 53:46.269
<i>Police have taken X-rated film star
John Holmes into custody.</i>

53:46.480 --> 53:49.472
<i>Holmes, known in the adult film industry
as Johnny Wadd,</i>

53:49.560 --> 53:52.279
<i>has starred in over 1,000 X-rated films.</i>

53:52.520 --> 53:54.750
<i>Those murders that occurred
up on Wonderland Avenue...</i>

53:54.840 --> 53:57.400
He hasn't even done a movie in, like,
two years.

53:57.600 --> 53:59.238
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

53:59.320 --> 54:03.791
<i>What involvement John Holmes may
have had in the murders is still unclear,</i>

54:03.880 --> 54:07.555
<i>but we should find out tomorrow when
he's arraigned in downtown Los Angeles.</i>

54:07.680 --> 54:10.638
<i>We are learning a little more
about Holmes' private life.</i>

54:10.720 --> 54:14.190
<i>We've uncovered court papers indicating
the porn star is currently married,</i>

54:14.280 --> 54:16.271
<i>but estranged from his...</i>

54:28.960 --> 54:30.792
What are you doing back with him, Dawn?

54:32.440 --> 54:36.035
I hadn't seen you in almost a year,
and I figured you'd just got away from him.

54:36.120 --> 54:42.150
I did. I did. I ran away. I got away, Sharon.
To Oregon. I was there for two months.

54:44.360 --> 54:47.716
And then I had a job, too.
I was a nurse, kind of like you.

54:54.840 --> 54:59.038
But, you know, he just kept calling.
You know, he just wouldn't stop.

54:59.320 --> 55:04.030
Every day, three times a day, and at first
I didn't even take his phone calls.

55:04.520 --> 55:06.318
And then he would tell my mother
every single night,

55:06.400 --> 55:11.520
"Tell Dawn I love her. Tell her good night."
Every single night before I went to bed.

55:12.120 --> 55:16.398
So, you know, I took his call.
I took his call.

55:19.360 --> 55:22.512
I didn't say a word. Nothing.

55:29.360 --> 55:31.078
And then he says...

55:32.720 --> 55:35.439
He says, "I can hear you breathe, baby."

55:38.360 --> 55:41.716
And I knew that just my breathing
was enough to keep him going.

55:41.800 --> 55:44.997
He said he knew he wasn't alone
because he had me.

55:47.560 --> 55:50.074
He's using you, Dawn.
When are you gonna see that?

55:50.240 --> 55:53.517
- He's been using you for five years.
- No, he's not.

55:54.400 --> 55:58.234
No, he's not, 'cause you know why?
I'm his girl. I'm his girl.

55:59.320 --> 56:00.674
Since I was 15 I've been his girl.

56:00.760 --> 56:04.435
Since that night in the van at the beach,
I've been his girl.

56:05.240 --> 56:08.870
You gotta get away from him, baby.
You just... You take...

56:09.400 --> 56:12.199
You take all the bad stuff
and you put it in a box,

56:12.280 --> 56:16.239
and then you just put it in a closet
and never look at it again.

56:17.920 --> 56:19.752
And then you move on.

56:42.080 --> 56:43.195
<i>He wants to talk to us.</i>

56:43.760 --> 56:46.070
We're willing to protect John
if he tells us everything,

56:46.480 --> 56:49.518
but he's scared,
and he fears for your safety,

56:49.600 --> 56:51.159
so he wants to see you both
before he says anything.

56:51.720 --> 56:52.755
So where is he?

56:52.840 --> 56:55.958
He's staying at a suite
at the Bonaparte Hotel downtown.

56:56.160 --> 56:59.516
- Dawn, do you want to go see John?
- Yeah, don't you?

57:20.440 --> 57:21.760
Detective.

57:32.480 --> 57:35.836
- Would you give me some privacy, please?
- Okay, sure.

57:38.160 --> 57:39.195
Hi.

57:45.520 --> 57:48.160
Don't say anything. The room's bugged.

57:48.520 --> 57:50.670
We're gonna go talk for a minute,
okay,baby?

57:50.760 --> 57:51.830
Okay.

58:16.560 --> 58:17.709
Okay.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.832
They've offered me a deal
and I think I'm gonna take it.

58:19.920 --> 58:20.955
Okay.

58:21.040 --> 58:22.997
They're gonna put me
in the Witness Protection Program

58:23.080 --> 58:25.640
if I tell them everything,
everything I told you,

58:25.720 --> 58:27.677
except I told them
I'm not saying anything about anything

58:27.760 --> 58:29.876
unless all three of us can go.

58:29.960 --> 58:31.917
- All three of us?
- And they agreed.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.958
- Wait, who's all three of us?
- You, me and Dawn. We can go tomorrow.

58:35.040 --> 58:37.554
No,no,no,
I'm not going anywhere tomorrow. No.

58:37.640 --> 58:40.200
No, Sharon, it's okay. They've got people
that can come and pack you.

58:40.280 --> 58:41.953
No,no,no.John,no.

58:42.080 --> 58:46.472
I am not going into the Witness
Protection Program with you. That's that.

58:46.720 --> 58:48.393
- Yes. Yes!
- No.No!

58:48.480 --> 58:49.959
- This is the new start...
- I'm not going into it.

58:50.040 --> 58:52.111
No, listen.
This is the new start we were talking about.

58:52.200 --> 58:54.271
- No, listen.
- Sharon, everything that we planned

58:54.360 --> 58:55.350
could happen now, okay?

58:55.440 --> 58:58.273
I don't want a fresh start with you, John.
Wake up!

58:58.360 --> 58:59.998
- Listen...
- Okay? No, you listen.

59:00.080 --> 59:01.639
I am through supporting you.

59:01.720 --> 59:04.599
What do you think, I would just leave
and never see my family again?

59:04.680 --> 59:06.398
- Sharon, hang on a second.
- It's gone too far this time.

59:06.520 --> 59:09.478
- If you don't help me with this, I am dead.
- You're already dead.

59:09.560 --> 59:11.676
Listen, this one last thing
is all I'm asking for.

59:11.760 --> 59:14.149
You've got... You've got to do it.

59:14.360 --> 59:17.000
- Stop it, John. Just stop it.
- What?

59:17.880 --> 59:19.359
- Sharon...
- Don't cry.

59:19.440 --> 59:21.272
- Listen, if you don't help...
- Don't you dare cry.

59:21.360 --> 59:23.078
That's not gonna work anymore.

59:23.880 --> 59:26.076
- Think I'd go anywhere with you amt this?

59:26.160 --> 59:29.596
Sharon, I am not gonna survive this
without you, okay?

59:29.840 --> 59:34.311
Really? You don't think you'll survive?
And you told me you were a survivor.

59:34.400 --> 59:35.629
- Remember that?
- What...

59:35.720 --> 59:38.280
- Look at how you're surviving, John.
- Sharon.

59:38.360 --> 59:39.589
Why did you come down here, then?

59:39.720 --> 59:42.553
What choice do I have?
What choice do I have?

59:42.680 --> 59:44.830
Why haven't you divorced me?

59:46.040 --> 59:48.793
- Sharon. Sharon. Sharon.
- I don't know. I don't know.

59:48.960 --> 59:51.520
Sharon, because you love me,
and you want to help me.

59:52.480 --> 59:54.471
It's too late, John. It's too late.

59:54.560 --> 59:57.200
Sharon. Look at me. Sharon.

59:57.800 --> 59:59.871
I know you love me, and I love you.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.918
Do you remember that day
15 years ago in the bathroom,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.560
-when you were measuring yourself?
- Yes.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:08.917
Do you remember that?
Remember what you said to me?

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.078
I said that I've...

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:14.869
I finally found
what I wanted to do with my life.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.639
Right. That's what you said.
Do you remember what I said to you?

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.754
What did I say?

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:25.629
What do you want me to say?
You said that if I sold my...

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.914
That's right. What did I say to you?

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.072
You tell me who you are.
What did I say to you?

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.314
You said anyone that sells their...

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.877
Their body is a whore.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.831
Stay away from the house.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.678
Detective Ward, thank you for coming out
on such short notice.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:53.039
Captain Nimziki explained the urgency.
Has he backed up any of Lind's testimony?

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.431
- He's hinting.
- Hinting?

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.435
He knows a lot.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.353
He's just playing his cards
very close to the chest.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.558
- What's he want?
- Immunity.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.000
What else?

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.396
- Protection.
- Really?

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.389
- How many you think?
- I have no idea.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.472
- You have no idea? You never counted?
- No. No.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.713
- Most men have.
- All right.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.998
- Why do you think that is?
- I don't know. I guess it's their ego.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.477
- Well, I'm thinking... I'm thinking Boca.
- Boca Raton?

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.270
- Yeah, is there another Boca?
- No, there's only one. Anywhere you want.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.590
That's the only one I ever heard of.
Boca, Boca Raton.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.638
I'm thinking Boca,
'cause I'm thinking of an alligator.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.472
<i>- Can you get me an alligator?
- An alligator?</i>

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:39.994
<i>Can you give me an alligator?</i>

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:43.193
I can see Boca, I can see the condominium,
I can see an alligator,

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.550
- like, on a chain.
- Right, right.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.995
And I need something
that implicates Eddie Nash.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.711
On the record.
Why don't you tell me about the robbery?

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.279
What robbery?

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.400
Hey, Bill.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.599
- Hiya, John.
- How you been?

01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.875
- Good.
- Good to see you.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.555
- Good to see you.
- I'm not talking in front of these guys.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.994
Long time.
Did you ever get those cigars I sent you?

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.356
- They were good.
- Right? The best.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.000
- You got taste.
- Yeah. You look good.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:18.039
- Thank you, John.
- What are you working on?

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.474
Administrative Vice.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.110
Administrative? You got a desk job?
That's insane, man.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.235
I'm an old man, John.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.273
I guess.
You break your legs or something? Jesus.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.591
No, I've been doing good.
You haven't, though, from what I hear.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.432
Yeah, what'd you hear?

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:36.195
You're doing a lot of drugs,
partying with the wrong crowd.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.836
Yeah, I'm a drug addict, Bill.

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.674
I know, John. I know about the robbery

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:48.071
that you and all those dead people
up on Wonderland pulled on Eddie Nash.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.074
You know, I'm not here as a cop.
I'm here as your friend.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.719
No, I know that, Bill.
Thanks for coming down.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:57.759
And thanks for the room, it's nice.
Everyone's been really good.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.715
Want to tell me about it,
or is this just a waste of my time?

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:05.680
- No, come on. Can we take a drive?
- I wish we could, John.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.238
You got any coke?

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.270
No, I can't do that.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.959
All right, how about a coffee, then,
with, like, a million fucking sugars?

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:20.232
<i>Just tell the story, John.
Tell me what you know.</i>

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.070
<i>We got a deal?</i>

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.756
Talk to me, John. Just tell me about it.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.320
<i>Sure, I'll tell you a story.</i>

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.358
<i>But if we don't have a deal,
then it's just a story, right?</i>

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.238
<i>I'm listening, John.</i>

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.592
Okay, Bill, I'm gonna tell you a story,
a story called "Wonderland."

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.910
Wonderland's the kind of house
that everyone on the whole mountain

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.152
hopes would burn down.
The lease was in Joy's name, Joy Miller.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.709
<i>She was a rich westie
that got all junked up,</i>

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.758
<i>got the cancer, both breasts removed,
still shooting junk.</i>

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.834
Her old man, Billy Deverell,
is a kind of dumb hick

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.877
who couldn't really
make up his mind about anything

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:56.919
without a guy like Ron Launius around
to come up with the idea.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.033
Ronnie's crazy and unpredictable,
but was always good with me,

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.758
until he got hooked up

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.912
with one of the sleaziest scumbags
to ever come down the Pike.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.513
<i>Dude from Sacramento, biker.</i>

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:12.278
This guy, stone-cold killer,
a liar, a thief and a rapist.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.998
- What was his name?
- David Lind. Don't believe a word he says.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.275
Now, you know me a long time, right?

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:21.874
<i>L can judge a character.
I know when a scene is a scene, right?</i>

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.474
This guy becomes the brains
of the operation,

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.278
so when they get too strung out
to do anything,

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.879
then he's got the perfect solution.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.633
- What?
- They stole.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.790
Kind of stuff that doesn't
get reported stolen, you know what I mean?

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.996
- Drugs?
- Drugs, guns, money, anything.

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.720
Whatever they wanted they came and took,
smash and grab stuff.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.154
How about that fucking coffee?

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.230
Now, I knew a big time fence
lived up the Donas.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.993
- Eddie Nash?
- Yeah.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.151
What is he,
your friend or your connection? What?

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.756
Look, we hung out. Bill, I'm not, like,
an altar boy, you know what I mean?

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.317
- I'd love to show you the boat.
- Is this your boat?

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.150
No.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:01.430
Hey, I know you! You're Johnny Wadd!

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.110
- Yeah.
- Johnny Wadd on my boat!

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:07.593
- I love your movies, man.
- What's your name?

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.075
Eddie Nash.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:14.280
This is my boat. Yes, I'm your biggest fan.
I see all your movies, yes.

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:20.276
Get out of here!
Yes, big star, John Wadd. Very big.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.238
Hey, listen, John,
you come up my house sometime,

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.152
-we hang out, we party.
- Sure, sure.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:30.278
I make a little coffee, we hang out,
we do other things.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.033
You know what I'm saying?

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.759
I knew him.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.511
Anyway, these guys do a big score
down at... Thanks.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.760
They hit a mark in West Covina
and got their hands on four antique guns,

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:44.071
I mean, really beautiful museum pieces.
Nice tooling and all that.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.596
<i>I didn't think Eddie would want the guns,
and I told David this.</i>

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.355
But I didn't feel like getting my ass kicked
either, right? So I go up there.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.555
And I was right.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:57.109
Eddie can't fence the guns, he says
they're too fancy, too high-profile,

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:00.551
so he gave us, like, two grand as collateral.

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.750
That is bullshit. Fucking bullshit, man.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:09.514
Eddie Nash, scumbag piece of shit.
Somebody ought to hit that guy, man.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.318
That's long-time money.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:15.109
I take the bad news back to the boys,
and what can they do?

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.560
It's Eddie fucking Nash, right?

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.754
Then, like, two weeks later they call me in,
and David says to me...

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.276
- You talk to Nash much?
- I was over there on Tuesday.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.151
- Did he ever mention those antiques?
- They're still $2,000.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:29.038
Screw that. Those are our guns.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.793
How many times you think
you've been in that house?

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.635
- Like, 20 or 30 times.
- You think you could draw us a map?

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.712
- A map? What for?
- Don't worry about it, John.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.714
<i>Did you do it?</i>

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.953
What, of the fucking palm trees?
I mean, buy a fucking <i>Thomas Guide.</i>

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.950
So we go up there,
this is David's bright idea.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.192
<i>David, Ronnie, Billy,</i>

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.511
<i>everyone's sitting in the car across
the street from Eddie Nash's house...</i>

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:58.116
- In through the kitchen.
- Definitely.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.549
<i>...and David's sitting there drawing a map.</i>

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:05.275
I tried to talk him out of it, I swear to God,
I'm sitting there in the car, I'm saying...

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.113
You guys are joking, right?

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.038
John, shut your hole.

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.951
<i>So, all of a sudden,
David's got everybody all hopped up,</i>

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.874
and then they decided,
"Let's stop talking and start taking."

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:22.237
Look, I know an actress in Tarzana,

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:25.790
and she's got, like, a wall of TVs
and, like, three microwaves.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.712
What are you, a nigger?

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.109
You have any brains,
or did it all go to your cock?

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.234
Fuck, you want to steal a microwave?

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:33.435
What the fuck are we gonna do
with a microwave, huh?

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:36.080
- Heat your food up with it.
- You think I'm hungry?

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.879
The only fucking thing I want to heat up
right now is some fucking dope, man!

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:41.031
I'm so fucking railed
I can't even fucking think straight.

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:43.152
This town is a fucking desert, man.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.913
What the fuck? Did Indo-fucking-china
dry up in this fucking city?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.992
I want some goddamn
motherfucking smack!

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:53.036
Shit, David, what the fuck, man?
I told you not to let me do so much blow.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.475
- You know how I get, shit!
- Even know who Eddie Nash is?

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.676
Do you think I give a shit?

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.877
Then they tell me I gotta participate.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.231
'Cause I know him.
Like knowing him means something.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:07.358
Yeah, well,
I don't want any part of that, man.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:12.712
You listen to me, motherfucker.
We're doing this.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.996
And if I have to Whack
that ass-grease knuckle-fuck

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.117
to get his shit, then that's that.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:21.796
<i>I could see it in their eyes.
They had made a decision.</i>

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.916
I went up there three times to warn Eddie.

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.154
Eddie, I'm not lying.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.676
You just gotta give those fucking fucks
back their fucking guns.

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.718
Fuck you and fuck your friends.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:38.792
But he's based out of his mind,
I mean, crazy-man psycho, 10 days straight.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.350
You want the guns
from the Nash? Motherfuck!

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.712
Come up and take them from the Nash.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.550
And I have to admit this, Bill,

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:54.874
I'm looking right in his eyes
and I'm thinking, "Better him than me.

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.958
"Better him than me."

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.755
What did they want you to do to help them?

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.716
- Kitchen door.
- Cool, man.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.431
They wanted me to unlock, like,
the kitchen door. Something like that.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:21.830
Did you do it?

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.709
Yeah. Yeah, that thing went down.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.554
Get him.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.591
I need another snack. You got the coke?

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.118
We fucking did it!

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.229
- How much you get? Everything?
- All of it, man, everything!

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:10.039
- You didn't hit the safe?
- Even the back bathroom, man!

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.594
Sue, I told you...

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.039
<i>After they hit Eddie,
they come back to Wonderland,</i>

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.158
<i>I'm there, and they're all hooping
and hollering about all the shit they got.</i>

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.153
<i>- What shit?
Everything. Guns, money, drugs.</i>

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.553
And they're not playing it cool, either.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:35.196
Phone's ringing off the hook,
and they keep answering it.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.109
Hello?

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:42.075
Yo, Joey, no, listen to this.
You are never going to guess

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.073
- Who we just fucking nailed!
- Let me tell him, come on.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.549
- Guess again, motherfucker!
- Let me tell him.

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:48.630
- Guess again!
- Let me tell him!

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.996
- All right, Ronnie wants to tell you.
- Eddie Nash!

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.274
You're not gonna believe this shit.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.718
They're telling people
that they hit Eddie Nash.

01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:58.756
Yeah. Can you believe that?

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:01.150
He and Billy sitting there
passing the phone back and forth, right?

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.230
Who are they talking to?

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.550
<i>Anyone that would listen.
Everybody that called, you know.</i>

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.199
<i>All their scumbag customers.</i>

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.271
<i>So I said something like,
"Ronnie, we should keep a low profile."</i>

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.395
<i>They didn't listen.</i>

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.679
Betamax. The Betamax. Get that out there.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.114
Man, out there, throw it.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.033
The fucking Betamax
out the fucking window!

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.877
<i>How fucking stupid is that?</i>

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.791
- So I fucking split.
- Where'd you go?

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:06.034
Santa Monica for a couple days.
Just laying low. Then I called Eddie.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.351
You called Eddie Nash?

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.552
<i>Yeah, I called him.
I was planning on leaving, man. I mean...</i>

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.837
<i>I mean, I wish I had left.</i>

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.513
<i>- What the fuck were you thinking?
- Listen, I knew if I didn't call him</i>

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.872
<i>that I'd never be able to show my face here
in LA. again.</i>

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.873
<i>- So what did he say?
- Bill, everything was cool.</i>

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.634
Hey, it's John.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:35.355
<i>1 call him up, he doesn't mention anything
about the robberies. "Come on up."</i>

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:37.954
All right, I'll be there. Right on.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.231
- Johnny boy.
- What's up?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.513
- Hey.
- Brother.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:13.390
- It's good to see you. Where you been?
- You know, around.

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.519
Well, I'm glad you come by. I need a favor.

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.434
- Sure, anything you want.
- I want you to beg.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.557
- What?
- I said beg, motherfucker!

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.835
Eddie, no!

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.917
- You think I'm stupid?
- No, Eddie!

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.638
You think I don't figure it out?

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.838
You bring those people into my house!
You piece of shit!

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:35.676
I fucking trusted you! You dog! Crawl.
Crawl like dog!

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.431
He's not crawling fast enough.
Greg, make him fly.

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.555
You know what they did to me?

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:50.631
You know what those motherfuckers
did to the Nash?

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.514
You like this? You fucking sand nigger.
You fucking greaseball.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:00.037
I'm gonna find out who you are,
you cocksucker motherfuckers.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:04.717
- I'm gonna tear your fucking eyes out!
- Suck this, you sand jockey faggot.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.158
Suck this.
Give me the fucking combination.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:12.838
They handcuffed me! They beat my women!

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.870
They dragged me upstairs.
They put gun in my mouth!

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.469
How do they know about the safe?

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.313
How do they know about the Nash's safe
under the bed from?

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.275
You know what they did to Greg?

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.350
Amateur motherfucker.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.192
You better kill me
or cancel Christmas, motherfucker.

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.315
Shut the fuck up, nigger!

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.311
I'II blow your black ass
straight back to Africa.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:34.472
Nash, fuck these motherfuckers.
It's amateur night!

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.551
- No witnesses.
- David, no!

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:40.917
You see what they did to Greg?
Show him, Greg. Show him.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.311
They shot heroin in my bathroom.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.596
They cut rails
on my daughter's vanity mirror.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.713
On my daughter's mirror!

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.834
- Yo, man, you want to ride this?
- No, man, that shit'll kill you.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.474
Come on, man. Let's fucking finish this.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:03.678
Wait a minute.
They were doing drugs during the robbery?

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.673
Yeah. And get this. On their way out...

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.957
John Holmes says hello!

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:12.951
- What? What?
- Yeah, he ratted me out.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.872
<i>Nash had been looking for me
for, like, two days,</i>

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.110
<i>so it was just dumb luck I called him.</i>

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.789
What are we gonna do now, brother?

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:33.636
Mary Holmes, 4315 West Jefferson,
Pataskala, Ohio.

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.791
Sharon Holmes, 2438 West Glendale.

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.280
You're gonna tell me who robbed me,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.911
because if you don't...

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.715
If you don't,
I'm gonna kill every person in that book,

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:54.316
starting with your mother,
your sister, your girlfriend,

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.280
that niece of yours, Gabrielle.
Every last one of them.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.230
I'm gonna torture them to death.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:07.759
And while I'm doing it,
I'm gonna tell them it's because of you,

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:10.717
and when they're dead...

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:16.716
When they're dead,
I'm gonna cut off your 14-inch cock,

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:20.837
chop it up, and shove it down your throat!

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:25.038
So, now you tell me.

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.192
Who the fuck hit me?

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:34.990
Eddie Nash has got a gun to your knee
and he says he's gonna kill your wife,

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.673
what would you do?

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:41.437
- I'd tell him.
- You're fucking-A right I told him.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.352
<i>And what did he say?</i>

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:52.553
You're going to do to those guys
on Wonderland what you did to me.

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.353
What did that mean?

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:59.554
Means I had to get in the car with his dudes

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:03.156
and then go over
and get inside of the Wonderland house.

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:17.355
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.311
- It's John, man.
<i>- What?</i>

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.834
It's John.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.120
What's up?

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.551
Knock yourself out, John.

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.600
- All right, man. You cooked?
- Yeah, man.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:33.157
- See you.
- Fucking unbelievable.

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:37.038
Fucking unbelievable.

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:41.632
- So you left the door unlocked?
- Well, no.

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.635
Ajar.

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:51.915
Did you see Greg or Danny
go in the house?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.150
<i>Did you hear anything at all?</i>

01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.631
- No.
- What about in the street outside?

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.319
<i>Did you see them in the street?
What about in the street?</i>

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:05.796
<i>Did you see them in the car
or approaching the house?</i>

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:11.951
No, I didn't see Diles, I didn't see Greg,
I didn't see Eddie after I got out of the car.

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.840
- Did you go back?
- Go back to Eddie's?

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.920
No,no,no.
Did you go back to Wonderland?

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.755
No.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.030
You sure?

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.757
No, why would I go back?

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:35.955
John...

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.715
Wait, here it comes, this is it.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.077
Were you present
when the murders happened?

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:43.555
No.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.031
Stay on him, stay on him,
stay on him, stay on him.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.834
Did you see them murdered?

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.555
No.

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:56.320
Bill, are you calling me a murderer?

01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.235
Come on.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:06.078
So, when you left them, they were all alive?

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.912
Yeah, when I left, they were alive.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.392
Eddie Nash had these people killed
because of a robbery that you set up.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:14.835
Come on, Ward.

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:17.753
- Yeah.
- And you'll testify to that.

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.997
<i>No. Haven't you been listening?</i>

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:25.074
He is the Prince of fucking Darkness.
What are you talking about, man?

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.673
You don't know who Eddie Nash is?

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.990
I worked Hollywood Vice for 20 years, John.
I know who Eddie Nash is.

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.435
What are you saying, man?
What are you saying?

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:35.912
Look, how do you expect me to protect you
if you won't go on the record?

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.356
I think I trust you.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:41.034
I think you could protect me.
I don't trust them.

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:44.431
<i>- So, what do you want me to tell them?
- Tell them whatever you want.</i>

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.718
Goddamn stroke job.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.872
He gives us nothing. Zero.
A fat fucking donut.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:56.438
He doesn't finger Nash.
He doesn't even put himself at the scene.

01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:00.349
The coroner's preliminary report
indicates that the murder weapons, plural,

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.875
were probably striated lead pipes
an inch in diameter.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:06.749
They got their skulls bashed in.
Whole pieces of bone, gone.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:10.712
Three women. And that sack of shit in there
set the whole thing up.

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.235
I've been going there for two,
three years, man. Dude calls me brother.

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:16.472
He just sells out Nash
and lets somebody else do the dirty work.

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:20.349
But then he gets screwed on the split.
Now he's pissed off.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.791
- Johnny boy. Hey.
- What's up?

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:25.440
So he hightails it back over
to Nash's house...

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:28.399
- John, my brother.
- How are you?

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:30.118
...and rats them out.

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:34.273
He handed Nash the Wonderland gang.
He served it up on a silver platter.

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:37.677
- Get back, plain and simple.
- Neighbors reported hearing loud noises,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.833
and they thought it was
some kind of primal scream therapy

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.799
-or something like that.
- It was a perfect plan, really.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.470
<i>There was people coming and going
all the time, always a party going on.</i>

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.074
Some loud noise at night
was not gonna raise an eyebrow.

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:54.152
Exactly, but what he didn't count on
was David Lind surviving.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.679
It had to be Holmes.

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.751
That piece of shit ratted us out!

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.036
Hey, I read Lind's statement.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.273
He paints himself out to be an angel.
He's lying his ass off.

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:06.591
I got pushed from behind
and my gun discharged accidentally.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.035
We don't know if any of his statement
is even true.

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.191
He knew who Nash was the whole time.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.874
You take these guns up there right now
or I'll cut your fucking head off.

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.157
What kind of thief doesn't even know
who he's hitting until the robbery itself?

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:19.470
What kind of fool
would set up the biggest gangster in LA...

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:20.709
Hey, Eddie what's up?

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.916
...and waltzes back to his house
like nothing happened?

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:23.990
Where you been?

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.789
Well, Eddie, I got a crazy story
I think you're gonna want to hear.

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.952
David Lind is not half the liar that
that cocksucker is.

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.031
David Lind lost the love of his life,

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:36.033
and he knows
that John Holmes is responsible.

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:38.039
Now, it wouldn't surprise me at all

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.680
if Holmes had planned on the murders
from the get-go.

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.793
You heard his story.

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:45.554
He pulls out my black book.
He's gonna kill everyone in it.

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:46.630
Your name's in there, Bill.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:47.994
Fuck the black book.

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:50.469
The black book is a crock of shit.
It's a fairy tale.

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:53.029
He knew that we were listening to him.
He just didn't want to get dirty.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:54.155
Neither does Lind.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:57.232
Four people get their heads bashed in
and there's not a single witness?

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:02.679
<i>No, no, he was in that house
as sure as Christ was on the cross.</i>

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:07.799
- Thirty-eight sets of different prints lifted.
- Any one of which could be our guy.

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:10.872
Including a left palm print,
palm down on the bedrail,

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.678
not two feet from Ron Launius' head.

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:16.515
Wait a minute. Are you trying to tell me
you think he swung the pipe?

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.989
He was either trying to kill him
or trying to screw him.

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:22.152
Look, you read Lind's statement.
Holmes hated Launius.

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.914
Launius embarrassed him in public
all the time.

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.758
No, it really would not surprise me
in the least

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.674
-if he had taken a couple whacks at him.
- You know what, Sam?

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.195
You can't even tie him
to the scene of the crime.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:37.035
The fact that he's got a pulse
ties him to the scene of the crime.

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:41.398
He doesn't need to be there, Nico.
Nash knows he's terrified.

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:45.309
- He'II keep his mouth shut.
- No, I don't buy it. Nash is not an idiot.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.710
He's certainly not gonna put his freedom
in the hands of one.

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.792
You know,
I've known John for almost 10 years.

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.273
While I'll admit that we haven't
spent much time together lately,

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.439
-the John I knowjust isn't capable...
- I don't know who you know or don't know.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.479
All I know is that the cocksucker
in the other room there is a basehead.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.109
And the one thing you can always know
about a basehead

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.919
is that they are completely full of shit.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.951
He's clicking us around.
A mile of click and no balls.

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:20.150
If he had some balls,
he'd come out and say, "I did it."

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.198
- But he ain't gonna do that.
- It's your call.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:31.274
Fuck it. We gotta cut him loose.

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.359
Hi, Sharon. Thanks so much for...

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.431
- Where's Dawn?
- She's in the car, but...

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.749
I want to talk to her.

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:56.753
Sharon, do you think
that's such a good idea?

01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:59.714
Sharon, just be cool, okay? Please.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.709
- Hey.
- Thank you.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.035
Hi.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.516
- You take care of him, honey.
- I will.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.477
You take care of yourself first.

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.358
- I will.
- Promise me.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.035
I promise.

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.760
You take care of this little one, too.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.037
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:32.234
- This is all I could get.
- Thanks so much, Sharon.

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.837
- I'll pay you back soon.
- Stop lying, I can't.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:39.079
- Sharon, I'm not lying. We'll pay you back...
-lt's a payoff, okay?

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:44.077
You should understand that term.
I'm paying you off to stay out of my life.

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.669
Sharon? Sharon.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.035
Sharon?

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:47.950
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry. I had an accident.

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.675
I'm sorry, can I come in, please?

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.834
Oh, my God, oh, my God, John, come in.

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.634
- Can you make it in?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.719
- Oh. my God. It's okay. It's okay.
-l'm sorry.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.393
- I had an accident.
- I see that.

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:06.917
Can I have a tub? I need a hot water tub.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.230
- You might need to go to a hospital.
- No.

01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.197
- John.
- Can I please...

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:13.989
It's okay.

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:17.232
- I don't feel well.
- It's all right, it's okay.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:20.439
I'm just gonna put you
in this chair, John, okay?

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.672
I'm just going to put you in this chair.
Sit down.

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.796
Could you fill the tub with water, please?

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.076
- It's not really going good out here.
- Okay.

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:32.191
Please. Okay.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.754
- Stay with me.
- No.

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.638
- You're in shock.
- No.

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:38.434
- I have to check you out.
- No, please make a tub of hot water.

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:41.672
I need to get...
Sharon, put the water in the tub!

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:44.354
I'm sorry. Hot water.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.798
- Stay calm.
- Okay.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.198
- Oh, God, you have a head injury.
- I'm sorry I yelled, but...

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:56.715
John?

01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:00.154
Easy. Okay, easy.

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.718
All right, John.

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:09.033
I'm okay. I'm getting in now. Okay, hot, hot.

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:13.510
John, close your eyes,
'cause this could sting if it gets in.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.239
I'm homesick.

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:19.672
- Where's the cut?
- There's too much blood.

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.320
- I gotta get it off, okay?
- John, where's the wound?

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.311
Give me more warm water. Like a firework...

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:27.074
Where's the wound, John?
There's no wound.

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:31.358
This isn't your blood, John.
Whose blood is this?

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:35.279
I need a sponge, 'cause it don't come...

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:38.080
- You have to really scrub.
- John,John!

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.230
What?

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:46.879
- What happened, John?
- Five people are dead, Sharon.

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:51.350
They were murdered. Up on Wonderland.

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:57.194
They shouldn't have done that to him,
though, they humiliated him, to the Nash.

01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:01.319
- They were so stupid.
- I'm not following this, John.

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:04.552
He had my book, Sharon.
He had my black book.

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:07.756
He had everyone's name in it.

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:12.158
He said he was gonna kill you,
so I told him. I couldn't let that happen.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:16.029
So then they went up to Wonderland.
They made me go there.

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.157
I did it for us, Sharon.
He had your name in there.

01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:22.756
- He said he was gonna kill you.
- What did you do for us?

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.797
I had to, Sharon. I had no choice.

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:28.430
There's so much blood.
Ron's head was like a firework.

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:32.832
I saw inside his head.
It just opened like a grapefruit.

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:37.637
What did you do, John?
What did you do, John?

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.799
I left before anything happened.

01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:51.555
I don't understand. What did you...
What did you do?

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.755
I left before anything happened.

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:02.671
- But I... I never... Sharon, I...
- No. No, I don't want to know. No.

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.433
- Sharon, I always...
- I don't want to know.

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:10.112
<i>No. You need to get out. You need to leave.
No, I want you out of my house.</i>

01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.638
- I want you to leave.
- Okay. Fine.

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:16.230
You don't understand anyway.

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:19.080
- I understand, I understand.
- What your husband had to do to survive...

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:22.909
- You brought filth into my life again!
- Filth? You want to know what filth is?

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.640
What your husband had to do to survive
down at Peanuts with those faggots.

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:28.109
You're not my husband!
You are not my fucking husband!

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:29.793
- Really?
- You're a gigolo.

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:34.676
Really? No, I'm Johnny fucking Wadd!
That's what I am, huh?

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:38.675
You know what they wanted
up at Wonderland? What Eddie wanted?

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.271
That thing, that thing,
that thing that makes me a star, Sharon.

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:45.034
- Look at me. Any idea what it's like?
- What thing are you talking about?

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:48.795
This thing! This fucking thing!
Everybody wants and nobody can have.

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.473
Do you remember when you loved it?
Can you even say...

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:53.757
That went away a long time ago, John.
A long time ago.

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.478
- You left me!
- Bullshit.

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:58.029
- That is not bullshit!
- That's bullshit, John!

01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:03.593
You left me! Then we can stop arguing.
You left me that day in the bathroom.

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:08.311
You chose that thing over me.
That disgusting thing! It makes me sick!

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.758
<i>- L'm not nobody, Sharon. I'm a star.
- You are a whore, John.</i>

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:16.238
Really? Yeah? I'm a survivor, Sharon!
I'm scum? I'm filth?

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:20.754
I'm alive. And those people at Wonderland?
They'll never laugh at me again.

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:23.992
They got theirs with a lead pipe,
and I'm still here, surviving.

01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:46.959
You know,
this case could make our careers.

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:48.514
This case could end our careers.

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:51.319
Nobody's gonna back us against Nash
without an eyewitness.

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:55.633
I talked to Nimziki this morning.
Nash is untouchable until November.

01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:58.951
- Shit. Whose dick's Nimziki sucking?
- Everybody's.

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:02.513
It's a goddamn swordfight in there. May I?

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.114
Miss Launius?

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.316
- Can she hear?
- I don't know.

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:35.154
God damn it, Ron, you told me
it was gonna be different this time.

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:36.594
I don't want to start like this!

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:38.591
- Come here.
- Goddamn it.

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:40.120
Come here.

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:41.833
Miss Launius?

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:45.153
Can you hear me?

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.639
I need you.

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:50.711
- I need you here.
- God damn it.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:55.237
Baby, I'm going crazy down here.
Come on, come on.

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.873
- That didn't last long, did it?
- Fuck you.

01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:31.917
Can you tell me anything
about what happened to you?

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.274
Shadows.

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.432
Shadows, shadows.

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:07.951
- What did she say?
- Nothing.

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.678
<i>- Yeah'?
-lt's John, man.</i>

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:41.114
Holmes, no.

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.669
<i>Come on, let me in, it's John.</i>
-No.

01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:06.632
Look! Look! Stop it, John!

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:20.354
Stop it, John! Stop it, John!
Look, you motherfucker!

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.716
Look at her motherfucking head
bust like that.

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.074
Are you looking at this, Johnny?

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:26.595
Look what you did!
Look what the fuck you did, Johnny!

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:29.559
You're a bad man, Johnny!
You want to fuck with me?

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:30.914
Let's go.

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.994
It's your turn, baby. It's Christmas.

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.760
Let's go to work, Johnny.
Let's go to work, baby.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:50.878
Let's go to work, baby. Let's go to work.
Let's get dirty, Johnny.

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:51.995
No.

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:56.319
Let's go! Let's get dirty, Johnny.
Let's get dirty, Johnny!

01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:00.277
Hit that motherfucker!
That's right. That's right!

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:04.158
Hit him! Love it! Hit him. Hit him.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:09.514
Look at you. Look at you. Oh, man.
Johnny's doing a movie.

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.876
- Another bad dream, baby?
- No.

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:30.993
What time is it?

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:33.035
6:00.

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.398
Morning or evening?

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:38.874
Morning.

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:44.474
- Didn't I promise I'd get you out of there?
- Yeah.

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:45.789
- Didn't I?
- Yeah.

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:47.149
Didn't I?

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:51.150
- Who's my girl?
- I'm your girl.
