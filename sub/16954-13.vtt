- She was a handful

32:16.225 --> 32:17.685
at the stables, though.
She wanted to, like, get down

32:36.746 --> 32:38.498
{\an3}you can put scared adults
on her,

32:38.581 --> 32:39.874
and she does really good.

32:39.957 --> 32:41.042
{\an3}So, you know, it's just,
first of all,

32:41.125 --> 32:43.336
it's finding a horse
that you like.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.046
And if I'm interested in one,
then that's when, you know,

32:45.129 --> 32:46.881
you call a boarding facility,
see what they offer,

32:46.964 --> 32:48.424
how much they are
before you even buy a horse.

32:48.508 --> 32:50.051
You know what I mean?

32:50.134 --> 32:52.095
Then you just kind of
go from there.

32:52.178 --> 32:53.888
- How much does boarding cost?

32:53.971 --> 32:56.099
{\an3}- You can get boardings
for $100 a month.

32:56.182 --> 32:58.434
{\an3}You can get boardings
up to $600 a month.

33:00.770 --> 33:03.523
{\an3}- No, he--like--$600 to $800.
So it depends.

33:03.606 --> 33:06.234
{\an3}It just depends on the boarding
facility that you pick.

33:06.317 --> 33:07.902
{\an1}- I was thinking

33:07.985 --> 33:10.738
{\an1}I was like, maybe Cate can,

different though.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.284

33:15.368 --> 33:16.953

33:17.036 --> 33:18.579
{\an1}- So what does volunteering
look like? You feed 'em?

33:18.663 --> 33:20.123
And that kind of stuff?
- Yeah, brush 'em.

33:20.206 --> 33:21.541

33:21.624 --> 33:22.583

33:22.667 --> 33:24.085
{\an1}- [laughs]
I'm just saying.

33:24.168 --> 33:24.919
- I want to buy a horse
so I know it's mine

33:25.002 --> 33:26.879
and I can go ride it
whenever I want

33:26.963 --> 33:29.090

to my house whenever I want.

and go with somebody.

33:32.510 --> 33:33.761
I can jump on my horse

33:33.845 --> 33:35.596
and go wherever I want to.

33:35.680 --> 33:36.931
- But what I'm saying is

33:37.014 --> 33:39.058
{\an1}what is the difference
in cost between

33:39.142 --> 33:40.935
{\an1}purchasing it outright
and then boarding it

33:41.018 --> 33:42.770
{\an1}or just paying $30 every time
you want to ride it?

33:42.854 --> 33:44.272
- It's way more expen--

33:44.355 --> 33:46.149
paying $30 every single time?

33:46.232 --> 33:48.401

I want to be able to

and it's mine.
