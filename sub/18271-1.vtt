00:54.696 --> 00:57.265
Ben, it's nearly
eight o'clock, honey.

00:57.365 --> 00:59.642
Are you in bed?

00:59.742 --> 01:01.186
Okay, Mom.

01:03.580 --> 01:06.983
- I'm on the bed.
- Not on, in.

01:07.083 --> 01:09.944
As in, you are "in" trouble, mister.

01:10.044 --> 01:13.740
But Mom, I have to
finish this drawing.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.658
It's a king.

01:15.758 --> 01:19.920
That's terrific.
And who's that little guy?

01:21.014 --> 01:23.500
Kind of a flying thing.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.170
I drew them on the same
paper 'cause they're pals.

01:27.620 --> 01:32.891
Well, pal... You're my flying thing
and you're flying right into bed.

01:34.027 --> 01:36.429
You can color more tomorrow.

01:36.529 --> 01:38.814
After we clean up this room.

01:40.346 --> 01:43.228
Which means you need
to feed the Trashosaur.

01:46.247 --> 01:48.066
Lights out, little guy.

01:48.166 --> 01:51.076
- I love you.
- I love you too, Mom.

01:57.926 --> 01:59.876
Good night, honey.

03:04.449 --> 03:07.020
Where am I? How did I get here?

03:09.205 --> 03:13.568
It's pretty dark.
Nothing to be afraid of.

03:13.668 --> 03:15.487
I hope.

03:18.089 --> 03:22.452
Oh, it's the gang.
They must be nearby.

03:26.681 --> 03:30.210
Up and at 'em, slowpokes.
We only got till morning.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.462
We gotta be back before Ben wakes up,

03:32.562 --> 03:35.180
and one minute's gone already.

03:36.065 --> 03:38.593
Come on, we're burnin' moonlight!

03:41.988 --> 03:44.265
Keep it down, you rusty wagon wheels.

03:44.365 --> 03:46.441
You'll wake the young 'un.

03:47.618 --> 03:50.188
Would you look what Ben
colored with me today.

03:50.288 --> 03:54.567
A green dog. Usually he
just uses me for grass,

03:54.667 --> 03:58.196
- or leaves.
- That is one groovy puppy.

03:58.296 --> 04:02.100
You know, last week,
Ben used me to color an elephant.

04:02.350 --> 04:04.357
A blue elephant.

04:05.345 --> 04:08.088
Kid sure is creative.

04:09.015 --> 04:11.167
All he ever uses me for is night.

04:11.267 --> 04:13.836
But nighttime is party time.

04:13.936 --> 04:17.548
And another thing:
he never colors inside the lines.

04:17.648 --> 04:19.634
Is it too much to ask for my chroma

04:19.733 --> 04:22.595
and pigmentation not to be
spread around haphazardly?

04:22.695 --> 04:25.098
He colors like a six-year-old.

04:25.198 --> 04:27.642
He is a six-year-old.

04:27.742 --> 04:30.103
Once in awhile, I'm an outline.

04:32.915 --> 04:35.566
What's it take to get some
help around this joint?

04:35.666 --> 04:38.111
Zam, what are you doing up there?

04:38.211 --> 04:40.863
I don't know, what are
you doing down there?

04:40.963 --> 04:44.033
Ben must have left her there
before he went to bed.

04:44.133 --> 04:47.412
- Hello.
- Don't flip your lid, Red.

04:47.512 --> 04:49.004
I got you covered.

04:56.938 --> 05:01.016
Well, it's about time.
Been up there all day.

05:02.193 --> 05:05.096
Well, I thought it
was a perfect catch.

05:05.196 --> 05:07.015
I probably would have dropped her.

05:07.115 --> 05:10.518
- Tangerine.
- Hello.

05:10.618 --> 05:12.353
Periwinkle.

05:12.453 --> 05:14.480
I'm here. Oh, did he see me?

05:14.580 --> 05:16.858
- I've... I've been here.
- Baby blue?

05:18.283 --> 05:21.237
- Orange?
- Juicy.

05:21.337 --> 05:23.573
- White.
- Did you see?

05:23.673 --> 05:26.242
Did you, Brown?
Ben reached for me today.

05:26.342 --> 05:28.953
Well, almost reached
for me, but still...

05:29.053 --> 05:32.040
I saw it, White,
and you know, pretty soon

05:32.140 --> 05:34.334
Ben's going to draw a holiday card.

05:34.434 --> 05:37.003
Now who do you think
he's gonna use for snow?

05:37.103 --> 05:40.840
Me! Gee, thanks, Brown.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.342
Tutti Frutti?

05:45.111 --> 05:47.096
Refried Bean.

05:49.115 --> 05:51.309
Aw, come on!

05:51.409 --> 05:53.728
All right now, let's see here.

05:53.828 --> 05:57.982
Yella? Yella? Yella!

05:58.082 --> 06:01.569
She's probably hiding
in a corner somewhere.

06:02.124 --> 06:04.897
Scared stiff, as usual.

06:08.972 --> 06:10.453
Almost there.

06:10.553 --> 06:14.082
Just a few more steps.

06:14.182 --> 06:16.209
Oh! Excuse me, I...

06:20.645 --> 06:22.263
Help!

06:25.902 --> 06:29.104
You'll wake the kid.
Where's the fire?

06:29.989 --> 06:32.600
Monster... under bed.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.520
Almost... almost got me.

06:35.620 --> 06:38.398
A monster? At this time of year?

06:38.498 --> 06:41.199
It'll probably devour us all.

06:48.949 --> 06:50.535
A sock monkey?

06:53.429 --> 06:56.707
- Silly me.
- Forget about it, Yellow.

06:56.807 --> 06:59.085
Never trust a toy made
from old laundry.

06:59.185 --> 07:03.548
And look at his smile.
Very insincere.

07:06.609 --> 07:10.645
Oh! Time flies, fellas.
We better head back.

07:14.534 --> 07:17.645
Well, hold up there,
you young whippersnappers.

07:17.745 --> 07:21.023
Always with the hippity-hop
music you have now.

07:21.123 --> 07:25.319
Why, back in my day,
crayons came four in a box,

07:25.419 --> 07:28.656
and none of these
fancy waxes neither.

07:28.756 --> 07:31.701
We were mostly made
of charcoal and mud.

07:32.470 --> 07:34.169
Those were the days.

07:35.888 --> 07:40.543
Don't let it fracture you, Yellow.
Everyone gets scared sometimes.

07:40.643 --> 07:41.669
You don't.

07:42.756 --> 07:45.089
Hey, come on.
I know how to cheer you up.

07:45.189 --> 07:47.633
Some extreme fun.

07:47.733 --> 07:51.637
No, no. Nothing with an
"extreme" in front of it.

07:51.737 --> 07:53.097
You go on ahead.

07:53.197 --> 07:54.223
You sure?

08:02.456 --> 08:05.533
Why am I always so
afraid of everything?

08:06.961 --> 08:09.322
You sure looked like a monster.

08:09.422 --> 08:12.033
I had every reason to be scared.

08:12.133 --> 08:13.951
It's not like I jump
at every little...

08:16.929 --> 08:18.873
Oh, it's just...

08:33.613 --> 08:35.765
Navy blue? Aquamarine?

08:35.865 --> 08:37.524
Aye aye, sir.

08:39.869 --> 08:41.312
Crayon-amo!

08:44.332 --> 08:46.359
Whoo! What a gas.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.070
It wasn't me.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.790
Consarn it, Blue!
You almost woke Ben up.

09:00.890 --> 09:02.667
Ooh. My bad.

09:02.767 --> 09:05.253
Time's a-wastin'.
We better high-tail it.

09:05.353 --> 09:07.887
- Okay, come on.
- Watch out.

09:15.645 --> 09:17.260
I love it!

09:23.496 --> 09:26.322
Look out below!

09:27.750 --> 09:28.992
Please.

09:32.046 --> 09:33.447
Yee-haw!

09:37.677 --> 09:39.412
Wait.

09:39.512 --> 09:40.663
Has anyone seen Yella?

09:43.773 --> 09:47.769
Wait for me! I'm here, Brown.

09:49.605 --> 09:51.048
Brown?

09:51.148 --> 09:54.844
Blue? Red?

09:54.944 --> 09:58.931
Anyone? I'm still here, guys.

09:59.031 --> 10:01.559
With the drawings, and the...

10:02.510 --> 10:03.826
dinosaur.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.319
Oh, no.

10:16.005 --> 10:18.908
Deep breaths. Find your happy place.

10:27.146 --> 10:28.377
Monster!

10:32.732 --> 10:38.436
Get... get away from me!
You... you... monster!

10:39.613 --> 10:40.774
Monster?

10:41.574 --> 10:43.934
Now see here, we're hardly monsters.

10:44.034 --> 10:47.313
Just pigments of Ben's imagination.

10:47.413 --> 10:48.845
Scribbles.

10:50.082 --> 10:51.367
Handsome scribbles.

10:52.793 --> 10:56.530
- It has two heads!
- Ooh, two heads?

10:56.630 --> 10:58.949
We should be so lucky.
I'm his wingman.

10:59.049 --> 11:01.410
Probably because I have wings.

11:03.512 --> 11:06.707
- The name is Nat.
- You're a gnat?

11:06.807 --> 11:12.380
Not a gnat, Nat!
I'm a flying... thing.

11:14.356 --> 11:16.300
Oh, and his best friend.

11:16.400 --> 11:21.055
Who is he? What is he?

11:23.365 --> 11:27.937
Allow me to introduce the
Crown Prince of Chiaroscuro,

11:28.037 --> 11:30.064
the Head of the Colorwealth,

11:30.164 --> 11:31.857
the Archduke of Saturation,

11:31.957 --> 11:34.151
the one and only,

11:34.251 --> 11:37.738
His Royal Poobah, King Scrawl.

11:40.216 --> 11:42.785
What do you want from me?

11:42.885 --> 11:47.581
Obviously. You're a crayon.
We're sketches.

11:47.681 --> 11:50.292
What do I have to do,
draw you a picture?

11:54.730 --> 11:56.882
Look, we just need a little color.

11:56.982 --> 12:00.010
I was thinking of
something in a paisley.

12:00.110 --> 12:02.555
Wha... what? By myself?

12:02.655 --> 12:05.683
I'm not supposed to color strangers.

12:05.783 --> 12:10.146
And besides, my tip
is all worn out...

12:10.246 --> 12:12.565
Well, what about all your friends?

12:12.665 --> 12:14.275
Can't they give us some color?

12:14.375 --> 12:17.452
They're all gone. See?

12:18.754 --> 12:21.490
Gone? Where?

12:21.590 --> 12:25.536
Through the secret door to
Color City, where crayons live.

12:27.972 --> 12:31.883
All the crayons? Secret door?

12:33.909 --> 12:37.673
You're right, boss.
That certainly looks like a secret door.

12:37.773 --> 12:40.509
That's not the secret door.

12:40.609 --> 12:43.971
And anyway, only crayons
are allowed in Color City.

12:50.452 --> 12:52.688
Maybe we need to knock.

12:54.915 --> 12:58.360
Oh, there's a doorbell!
This must be the place.

12:58.460 --> 13:01.363
But that really isn't
the way to Color City.

13:01.463 --> 13:04.992
Don't listen to her, boss.
She's just trying to trick us.

13:06.677 --> 13:08.412
What about this doohickey?

13:34.788 --> 13:36.607
Get me out of here!

13:36.707 --> 13:40.402
Please let me out!
I don't like small places.

13:40.502 --> 13:42.870
I've never even been to Rhode Island.

13:45.883 --> 13:49.787
Zing! Thanks, Your Royal Stompiness.

13:49.887 --> 13:54.006
Hey. Where's Little Miss Yellow?

14:17.481 --> 14:19.233
I'm home.

14:27.466 --> 14:29.493
Color City!

14:29.593 --> 14:33.038
I... I made it. Yay!

14:45.234 --> 14:48.519
- Hey, Yellow, how you doing?
- Hi, Yellow.

14:51.573 --> 14:55.019
- Yellow! Where you been?
- We were worried.

14:55.119 --> 14:57.938
- I assumed the worst.
- There's a shock.

14:58.038 --> 15:00.858
You know, Brown was about
to organize a search party.

15:00.958 --> 15:04.653
Or, as I think he put it, a... posse.

15:04.753 --> 15:07.239
It was awful. I was attacked.

15:07.339 --> 15:09.742
- What?
- By a big, huge, ginormous...

15:09.842 --> 15:12.077
Sock monkey? A rubber ducky?

15:12.177 --> 15:16.165
Wave of panic. Yeah, that's it.

15:16.265 --> 15:20.051
I was scared because I was all alone.

15:21.437 --> 15:24.715
Well, at least it wasn't
a monster this time.

15:24.815 --> 15:28.636
And just look at your tip.
Blunt as blunt can be.

15:28.736 --> 15:30.596
You could use a little
trip to the spa.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.306
Good idea, Blue.

15:32.406 --> 15:35.434
You'll be as good as new
in no time, you'll see.

15:35.534 --> 15:37.276
Do we have an appointment?

15:40.205 --> 15:43.734
Ma cherie, hello.
What happened to you?

15:43.834 --> 15:45.486
My gentle, blushing flower.

15:45.586 --> 15:48.072
I had an... episode?

15:48.172 --> 15:51.617
Surprise, surprise, she got
left behind in Ben's room.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.886
I'm such a klutz.

15:54.236 --> 15:58.123
Left behind?!
But anything could have happened.

15:58.223 --> 16:00.668
You could have been hurt.

16:01.367 --> 16:03.712
Or broken, no?

16:03.812 --> 16:07.841
Broken? I... No. Anything but that.

16:10.360 --> 16:16.475
Aiee! Look at your tip!
It's all flat and horrible.

16:16.575 --> 16:20.145
Alors, we fix you in a jiffy.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.064
See you at the beach, Yellow.

16:23.151 --> 16:25.609
But not so fast.

16:25.709 --> 16:28.195
You do not need the spa.

16:28.295 --> 16:31.115
But Madame Pink, I was used today.

16:31.215 --> 16:32.574
What did you color?

16:32.674 --> 16:36.036
Oh, Ben used me to draw...

16:36.136 --> 16:39.581
- A sheet of paper.
- A sheet of paper.

16:39.681 --> 16:43.210
What? No. Oh, yes! Yes.

16:43.310 --> 16:46.213
I mean, a cloud.

16:46.313 --> 16:48.799
- A cloud?
- No. Yes!

16:48.899 --> 16:51.385
- Fruit!
- White fruit?

16:51.485 --> 16:53.637
No. Yes.

16:53.737 --> 16:56.849
An apple. Banana?

16:56.949 --> 16:58.934
- An orange!
- Say what?

16:59.034 --> 17:01.854
How many times must
we go through this?

17:01.954 --> 17:05.232
I know you have not been used.

17:05.332 --> 17:08.152
Please. I've never
even been in the spa.

17:08.252 --> 17:12.156
Someday you will. But not today.

17:14.174 --> 17:16.785
Someday soon, I hope.

17:16.885 --> 17:18.787
Coloring is overrated.

17:18.887 --> 17:22.415
Are you kidding?
Coloring is what we do.

17:22.516 --> 17:24.960
I just know I'll be useful someday.

17:25.060 --> 17:27.511
I just have to be.

17:39.199 --> 17:41.776
Oh, hi!

17:48.834 --> 17:52.321
What does this mean, this...

17:52.421 --> 17:55.157
sock monkey? Qu'est ce que c'est?

17:55.257 --> 17:57.367
It's kind of like a real monkey,

17:57.467 --> 17:59.119
but made out of socks.

18:00.218 --> 18:01.647
Socks!

18:03.431 --> 18:06.794
I know, right? I just wish...

18:06.894 --> 18:09.004
If only I was cool, like Blue.

18:09.104 --> 18:11.215
Or as strong as Red.

18:11.315 --> 18:14.009
Or even as organized as Green.

18:14.109 --> 18:16.220
They would have known how
to deal with King Scrawl.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.955
King Who? What, what, what?

18:18.055 --> 18:19.598
Nothing.

18:19.698 --> 18:23.352
Oh, cherie, we are all
special in our own way.

18:23.452 --> 18:25.813
We each get to be one color.

18:25.913 --> 18:28.649
Except for Tutti Frutti!

18:28.749 --> 18:32.194
Whoo hoo hoo! I can sing a rainbow!

18:36.006 --> 18:39.076
Oui. Except for her.

18:39.176 --> 18:42.663
Being yellow is a good thing,
n'est ce pas?

18:42.763 --> 18:44.832
I guess.

18:44.932 --> 18:48.127
Yellow. Yellow?
Tick-tock, beach party.

18:48.227 --> 18:49.920
Oh, I almost forgot.

18:50.020 --> 18:52.464
I'm meeting my pals at the marina.

18:52.564 --> 18:53.931
Au revoir!

18:58.695 --> 19:00.764
- Hey there, Yellow.
- Hello, dearie.

19:00.864 --> 19:02.057
Hey, Yellow.

19:06.745 --> 19:08.939
Get off my lawn!

19:09.039 --> 19:11.650
Madame is right. Maybe I am special.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.068
I can be anything I want.

19:13.168 --> 19:14.820
<i>With colors so bright</i>

19:14.920 --> 19:16.905
<i>Oh, it reminds me of Spring</i>

19:17.005 --> 19:20.909
<i>And ringing my bell just
makes me want to sing</i>

19:21.009 --> 19:24.705
<i>The air is so rosy,
so sparkly and light</i>

19:24.805 --> 19:29.168
<i>It's golden all day and
deep purple at night</i>

19:29.268 --> 19:32.713
<i>Riding along makes me feel so happy</i>

19:32.813 --> 19:36.592
<i>The city is shining,
its colors are snappy</i>

19:36.692 --> 19:40.179
<i>The sky is so blue and
the buildings all gleam</i>

19:40.279 --> 19:44.433
<i>If I wasn't awake, I'd be in a dream</i>

19:44.533 --> 19:48.061
<i>Ring a little bell
and off I go singing</i>

19:48.161 --> 19:52.191
<i>The colors keep time to
my bell's ding-a-linging</i>

19:52.291 --> 19:55.694
<i>A bright little tune
I will sing from the start</i>

19:55.794 --> 20:01.707
<i>The song that I sing
also rings in my heart</i>

20:03.635 --> 20:07.331
<i>When you are singing,
your cares disappear</i>

20:07.431 --> 20:11.376
<i>And when you are ringing,
it makes colors clear</i>

20:11.476 --> 20:15.047
<i>A red star is twinkling,
there's green in the trees</i>

20:15.147 --> 20:19.218
<i>Blue is a whisper and
white is the breeze</i>

20:19.318 --> 20:23.096
<i>Some hues are loud,
and others are mellow</i>

20:23.196 --> 20:26.725
<i>I love them all,
from magenta to yellow</i>

20:26.825 --> 20:30.646
<i>Colors are with us
in moon glow or sun</i>

20:30.746 --> 20:34.650
<i>And singing about them
is just so much fun</i>

20:34.750 --> 20:38.445
<i>Ring a little bell
and off I go singing</i>

20:38.545 --> 20:42.157
<i>The colors keep time
to my bell's ding-linging</i>

20:42.257 --> 20:46.161
<i>A bright little tune
I will sing from the start</i>

20:46.261 --> 20:52.174
<i>The song that I sing
also rings in my heart</i>

20:54.436 --> 20:58.215
<i>Ring a little bell
Ring a little bell</i>

20:58.315 --> 21:00.724
<i>Ring a little bell</i>

21:01.777 --> 21:08.065
<i>The song that I sing
also rings in my heart</i>

21:17.952 --> 21:19.861
Oh, no! It's him.

21:40.816 --> 21:43.385
One blueberry frappé.

21:43.485 --> 21:46.930
Thank you, darling.
Just what the doctor ordered.

21:47.030 --> 21:48.849
Hello, all.

21:48.949 --> 21:50.350
I hope I'm not late.

21:50.450 --> 21:52.769
Yellow should be here any second.

21:52.869 --> 21:56.523
You know, Green, I'm starting
to get worried about Yellow.

21:56.623 --> 22:00.335
- Oh?
- She's seeing monsters everywhere.

22:01.878 --> 22:04.406
Yeah. I hope she hasn't
snapped her cap.

22:04.506 --> 22:07.451
Girl's going all delusional on us.

22:08.874 --> 22:11.163
- Yikes!
- Yikes?

22:11.763 --> 22:13.172
Yikes, man!

22:20.564 --> 22:22.632
I'm going this way now!

22:22.732 --> 22:25.135
That's a big monster.

22:25.235 --> 22:29.563
He's crayon-napping Yellow!
Somebody do something!

22:30.490 --> 22:34.102
Doesn't screaming and
running in circles count?

22:34.202 --> 22:35.629
I guess.

22:36.621 --> 22:39.983
Hold it! All right, you varmint.

22:40.083 --> 22:42.027
As sheriff of this here city

22:42.127 --> 22:44.446
and on behalf of crayons everywhere,

22:44.546 --> 22:46.907
I order you to cease and desist

22:47.007 --> 22:49.618
any and all
monster-related activities.

22:51.234 --> 22:52.320
Pronto.

22:56.475 --> 22:59.294
- After him!
- Charge!

22:59.394 --> 23:01.546
Oh, my goodness. Hold on, hold on!

23:01.646 --> 23:05.050
That doesn't look safe at all.
Oh, Yellow!

23:12.032 --> 23:16.353
Keep him in your sights!
It's time for Plan A.

23:24.544 --> 23:26.745
This way, this way!

23:41.019 --> 23:43.029
Put me down! Put me down!
Put me down!

23:43.129 --> 23:44.679
Let me go!

23:50.779 --> 23:52.848
Don't let me go! Don't let me go!

23:52.948 --> 23:54.266
Don't let me go!

23:54.366 --> 23:56.768
Afraid of heights?

23:56.868 --> 23:59.771
Heights, crowds, germs,

23:59.871 --> 24:01.356
- the dark...
- Okay, okay...

24:01.456 --> 24:04.067
vacuum cleaners, cats,
bugs, sock monkeys...

24:04.167 --> 24:06.486
I get the picture!

24:06.586 --> 24:09.197
- And trees.
- Trees?

24:09.297 --> 24:10.991
You're afraid of trees?

24:11.091 --> 24:13.160
They've got pointy branches!

24:13.260 --> 24:16.288
Well, their bark is worse
than their bite, you know.

24:17.743 --> 24:19.708
Oh, that was awesome!

24:19.808 --> 24:21.877
I'm so funny.

24:24.896 --> 24:30.017
Yee-haw! Plan A for aero-plane!

24:34.990 --> 24:37.608
Help!

24:38.577 --> 24:41.153
Hang on! I'm comin' for ya', Yella!

24:43.415 --> 24:46.950
Yee-haw!

24:47.210 --> 24:48.528
Whoa, Nellie!

24:48.628 --> 24:50.989
I got some sort of turkey on my tail!

25:01.406 --> 25:03.543
Hoo-doggies, I been hit!

25:04.644 --> 25:07.380
I got her! I got her! I got her!

25:07.480 --> 25:08.673
Gotcha!

25:10.191 --> 25:11.266
Incoming!

25:17.198 --> 25:19.434
Brown, are you all right?

25:19.534 --> 25:22.270
I think my saddle's sore.

25:22.370 --> 25:24.606
We must rush you to the hospital!

25:24.706 --> 25:25.948
Tout suite!

25:27.167 --> 25:30.570
Well, what do we do now,
your Royal Clumsiness?

25:40.096 --> 25:42.123
I gotcha.

25:42.223 --> 25:44.584
Why deal with this pain in the tail

25:44.684 --> 25:47.462
when we can go straight
to the source?

25:56.071 --> 26:00.141
Blue, you and Brown
really saved my wrapper.

26:00.241 --> 26:02.227
Please. You're making me blush.

26:02.327 --> 26:05.063
And when I blush, I turn purple.

26:05.163 --> 26:07.440
What's so wrong with that?

26:07.540 --> 26:09.975
Did you see that?
The monster was all...

26:10.285 --> 26:11.903
And Yellow was all...

26:12.003 --> 26:14.538
And we were all...
And it was horrible!

26:15.340 --> 26:18.326
Well, he's gone.
Our troubles are over.

26:18.426 --> 26:21.795
I sure wish that were true.
Lookee yonder.

26:24.307 --> 26:26.459
What does it mean?

26:26.559 --> 26:30.637
I'm afraid our troubles
are only just beginning.

26:35.777 --> 26:38.305
All right, all right,
simmer down now, young 'uns.

26:38.405 --> 26:42.350
We've put our best minds to
work on the sitch-e-ation.

26:42.450 --> 26:44.936
Professor Heliotrope from
ColorTech University

26:45.036 --> 26:47.647
is here to make his report.
Professor?

26:47.747 --> 26:51.484
Oh, now it's my turn to
speak with the talking

26:51.584 --> 26:54.404
and the lips with the
flapping and explaining.

26:55.204 --> 26:57.532
Hello, nice cowboy man.

26:57.632 --> 27:00.660
I'm not quite ready though
with the screen for the light

27:00.760 --> 27:03.371
and the showing of the thing
which is happening with...

27:03.471 --> 27:07.208
Oh! Where did everyone go?
It's like a magic trick.

27:08.601 --> 27:10.754
Oh, my glasses. There they are.

27:10.854 --> 27:12.547
Okay, well... Well, then.

27:12.647 --> 27:16.551
Lights, please and
thank you, very nice.

27:16.651 --> 27:19.012
All right, the slide
numbering one, please.

27:19.112 --> 27:21.556
Then slide the first,
the premiere, yes.

27:21.656 --> 27:23.933
Thank you. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

27:24.033 --> 27:27.145
Well, this represents the rainbow

27:27.245 --> 27:29.814
which comes down with all the color

27:29.914 --> 27:32.525
and the color falling into the lake,

27:32.625 --> 27:33.985
giving us the tinting

27:34.085 --> 27:35.779
and all the prettiness in the city,

27:35.879 --> 27:39.824
like I said, for living.
Living and happy, smiling.

27:39.924 --> 27:42.786
Slide number two.
The two is next to one

27:42.886 --> 27:44.663
and number four through... Thank you.

27:44.763 --> 27:47.332
And here we see the colorfall,

27:47.432 --> 27:50.126
through which the
metamorphosis of the rain...

27:50.226 --> 27:52.671
Ooh, double rainbow!
To the lake, to the lake,

27:52.771 --> 27:54.964
gives us the color, setting us apart

27:55.064 --> 27:57.759
from other art materials
like ink blots,

27:57.859 --> 27:59.844
and lumps of clay and pencil lead,

27:59.944 --> 28:02.347
and what do they do with the pastels?

28:02.447 --> 28:05.850
The smudging.
All right and the next slide.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.519
Oh, you're good at that. Thank you.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.813
Oh, and here I am at
the beach last year

28:09.913 --> 28:13.358
having a wonderful vacation,
it was so nice.

28:13.458 --> 28:16.277
They brought me the drink
with the big thing in it

28:16.327 --> 28:18.363
that stabbed me in the eye.

28:18.713 --> 28:20.323
I don't even know how
that got in there.

28:20.423 --> 28:22.534
Okay, let's move along.
Press the button.

28:22.634 --> 28:24.703
See, again, you're very
good at this in the back.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.996
Look, now, there are...

28:27.096 --> 28:29.082
Drumroll and moment of seriousness.

28:29.182 --> 28:33.628
Here, you can clearly
see my postulation:

28:33.728 --> 28:38.598
Limpidus non carborundum est.

28:39.025 --> 28:41.761
Run that by us again, Professor.

28:41.861 --> 28:43.096
In English?

28:43.196 --> 28:44.597
What, you didn't get
it the first time?

28:44.697 --> 28:46.307
All right, I'll do it again.

28:46.407 --> 28:49.352
Assuming the insertion of the Monster

28:49.452 --> 28:52.939
between the Rainbow
and the Colorfall, he...

28:53.039 --> 28:54.899
It's very simple, actually.

28:54.999 --> 28:59.821
No color, removed.
We become transparent.

28:59.921 --> 29:02.991
Transparent?
You mean I'll lose my color?

29:03.091 --> 29:05.577
Well, everybody
will lose their color.

29:05.677 --> 29:10.707
And if we lose our color,
we'll cease to exist.

29:16.271 --> 29:18.590
Any questions?

29:25.712 --> 29:26.897
It figures.

29:27.907 --> 29:31.109
Whoa, whoa! Hold your horses.

29:31.327 --> 29:33.438
Folks, I ain't gonna sugarcoat it.

29:33.538 --> 29:35.523
We're up a crick without a paddle.

29:35.623 --> 29:38.067
I'll say! No Crayon
I've ever heard of

29:38.167 --> 29:40.153
has traveled that far before.

29:43.756 --> 29:46.576
Now Red, no need to get everyone

29:46.676 --> 29:48.870
more riled up than they already are.

29:48.970 --> 29:52.332
- Green, what time is it?
- We have precisely five hours,

29:52.432 --> 29:54.334
fifty-eight minutes and
twenty-seven seconds

29:54.434 --> 29:57.128
- before Ben wakes up.
- All right, all right.

29:57.228 --> 30:00.048
We need ourselves some
volunteers to go upriver

30:00.148 --> 30:04.135
and stop this scrawly sidewinder
who's messing with our color.

30:04.235 --> 30:07.430
- Who'll be first?
- I'm in.

30:07.530 --> 30:11.267
Atta boy. Knew we could
count on you. Anybody else?

30:11.367 --> 30:14.020
We each get to be one color.

30:14.120 --> 30:18.775
I'm tired of feeling useless.
This is our chance.

30:18.875 --> 30:23.279
Always knew we'd end up on
a perilous mission of doom.

30:23.379 --> 30:25.198
We're in!

30:25.298 --> 30:27.909
Hey!

30:28.009 --> 30:31.371
Do I see another bold
color in the house?

30:34.265 --> 30:37.210
- Green?
- Nice going, Greenhorn!

30:37.310 --> 30:41.339
Someone's gotta keep track of
time and keep things organized.

30:43.608 --> 30:46.886
No big galoot is gonna
steal my color.

30:46.986 --> 30:49.264
- I'm coming too!
- Zam!

30:49.364 --> 30:52.183
This is gonna be one crazy voyage.

30:52.283 --> 30:54.352
Well, there's our posse.

30:54.452 --> 30:57.939
Unless there's another volunteer?
We got room for one more.

30:58.039 --> 31:01.401
Not a lot of room. I have luggage!

31:21.270 --> 31:25.182
Lawn, lawn... get off my lawn.

31:28.945 --> 31:31.598
Come on, boss. Almost there.

31:37.662 --> 31:39.779
Oh!

31:49.090 --> 31:51.993
It's so pretty. I love it.

31:54.512 --> 31:57.672
I hope he's right about
this color thing.

32:00.059 --> 32:03.630
Well, if you're ready, so am I,
your Royal Tie-Dyediness.

32:03.730 --> 32:06.925
On your mark, get set. Color!

32:07.025 --> 32:08.676
Yeah!

32:19.287 --> 32:21.773
This is so much fun!

32:30.423 --> 32:32.659
Hoo-ha, boss. We're in color!

32:32.759 --> 32:34.744
You think this is the
right combination for me?

32:34.844 --> 32:36.204
I'm a sort of an autumn.

32:36.304 --> 32:38.581
I don't want to look too summer-y.

32:41.851 --> 32:43.419
Oh, you've paled out a bit.

32:46.189 --> 32:48.091
Well, that was disappointing.

32:48.191 --> 32:51.386
Just jumping in doesn't
seem to do the trick.

32:51.486 --> 32:54.555
I guess it's only crayons that
can color drawings like us.

32:54.655 --> 32:57.517
You know, decent,
sophisticated, grown up.

32:57.617 --> 33:00.498
Hard lines, handsome...

33:01.070 --> 33:03.405
What's going on? What do you see?
What's happening?

33:10.421 --> 33:13.992
Yes, I see,
your Royal Plumbermeister!

33:14.092 --> 33:15.660
If we plug up the colorfall,

33:15.760 --> 33:17.912
the crayons will have to
come here to unclog it,

33:18.012 --> 33:21.798
and then we can get them to color us!

33:31.734 --> 33:34.887
Avast, me hearties!
This be our vessel?

33:34.987 --> 33:37.682
Well, Green, it's good to
see you came prepared.

33:37.782 --> 33:40.018
Oh, indeed, only the essentials.

33:40.118 --> 33:43.271
My cappuccino machine, my bunny
slippers, etcetera, etcetera.

33:47.583 --> 33:49.444
Hey, didn't you pack anything?

33:49.544 --> 33:51.696
We had to pack? No one told me.

33:51.796 --> 33:53.281
Did you pack anything?

33:53.381 --> 33:55.074
Only my sunny disposition.

33:55.174 --> 33:57.702
People, people, don't freak.

33:57.802 --> 33:59.787
I didn't bring anything either.

33:59.887 --> 34:02.665
Well, I hope you at least
packed clean underwear.

34:02.765 --> 34:05.460
Of course! Six pairs.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.295
Plus two in case of accident.

34:08.585 --> 34:12.341
- Hello, everyone!
- Yellow, it's good to see ya.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.302
Cool, man! You're coming with us?

34:14.402 --> 34:16.512
No, no. I'm not going.

34:16.612 --> 34:18.889
This is just some things
I thought you'd need.

34:18.989 --> 34:21.516
- It's the least I can do.
- Nice job.

34:21.617 --> 34:24.062
Compass. Tent. Lantern.

34:24.161 --> 34:26.813
"Map of Scary Places."

34:26.914 --> 34:28.858
It's a map.

34:28.958 --> 34:31.277
Very practical.

34:31.377 --> 34:34.781
And it's utilitarian,
and it's pragmatic, too!

34:34.880 --> 34:37.324
Those are synonyms, I think.

34:37.425 --> 34:39.577
One word before you depart.

34:39.677 --> 34:43.371
You're going where no crayon
has ever gone before.

34:43.472 --> 34:47.502
I sure wish I was going with you,
but I'm a bit, hog-tied.

34:47.601 --> 34:50.630
All I can do is wish you luck
and remind you not to be late,

34:50.730 --> 34:53.841
'cause if you don't get
back before Ben wakes up,

34:53.940 --> 34:55.885
you'll be lost forever.

34:55.985 --> 35:01.641
No Ben, no coloring, no nothing.

35:01.741 --> 35:04.685
Oh, yes, Inkdiana.

35:04.785 --> 35:07.605
I spoke at a seminar
once there one time.

35:07.705 --> 35:09.524
They have a lovely convention center.

35:09.624 --> 35:11.901
Oh, yes, indeed! Very colorful!

35:12.247 --> 35:14.369
No! The map!

35:16.214 --> 35:17.490
Why don't you take that...

35:17.590 --> 35:21.418
- Here, Blue, you'll need this.
- Oh, thanks, Yellow!

35:23.346 --> 35:24.664
What am I looking at here?

35:24.764 --> 35:29.544
Oh, Blue, that's the wrong side.
Here, like this.

35:30.970 --> 35:32.130
A cotton blend!

35:32.230 --> 35:35.091
That's some quality rope,
if I do say so myself.

35:35.191 --> 35:37.510
You really should only go
for the quality ropes.

35:37.610 --> 35:40.012
And cables, and bungees.

35:40.112 --> 35:43.199
And anything else that
falls in the line of string.

35:43.499 --> 35:44.934
What the...?

35:45.034 --> 35:47.186
Hey, I didn't say cast off,

35:47.286 --> 35:49.397
but... cast off!

35:49.497 --> 35:51.232
Cast off? Wait!

35:51.332 --> 35:53.484
I'm not supposed to be here!

35:55.836 --> 35:59.490
Oh, they are so brave, n'est-ce pas?

35:59.590 --> 36:03.953
Braver than a armadillo
crossing the highway.

36:08.828 --> 36:13.254
Yellow! Up top!
I'm glad you decided to come!

36:13.354 --> 36:16.424
Well, I didn't exactly decide to.

36:16.524 --> 36:19.051
Don't worry, it's gonna be fun!

36:20.736 --> 36:24.223
- Isn't this exciting?
- Exciting?

36:24.323 --> 36:26.642
We could get the wax
peeled off our tips,

36:26.742 --> 36:28.102
our wrappers could get torn,

36:28.202 --> 36:30.354
or we might even get broken.

36:30.454 --> 36:32.106
Broken?

36:32.206 --> 36:34.866
Mommy.

36:42.383 --> 36:44.202
This isn't too bad.

36:44.302 --> 36:50.166
I can handle this.
A nice relaxing boat ride.

36:50.266 --> 36:52.376
<i>Heave ho, I'm pirate-talking</i>

36:52.476 --> 36:54.295
<i>Heave ho, our knees are knocking</i>

36:54.395 --> 36:58.389
<i>Heave ho, our boat is rocking
Early in the morning</i>

36:59.275 --> 37:01.219
To be at sea.

37:01.319 --> 37:03.763
The fresh, clean salt air.

37:03.863 --> 37:05.806
The gentle swaying of the ship.

37:05.906 --> 37:09.185
Back and forth, back and forth,

37:09.285 --> 37:12.403
back and forth.

37:15.082 --> 37:17.610
Oh, on my wrapper.

37:17.710 --> 37:20.571
Argh, a landlubber. My apologies.

37:20.671 --> 37:23.574
Being on the water brings
out my inner pirate.

37:23.674 --> 37:25.201
Yarrr.

37:25.301 --> 37:29.330
<i>Heave ho, off we go</i>

37:29.430 --> 37:32.792
<i>It's time to save the day</i>

37:32.892 --> 37:34.710
<i>From the giant</i>

37:34.810 --> 37:40.549
<i>Who's trying to take our colors away</i>

37:40.649 --> 37:42.468
<i>I'm Green, I like to stay on track</i>

37:42.568 --> 37:44.470
<i>If we're on time, I've got your back</i>

37:44.570 --> 37:46.180
<i>How can we pick up some slack</i>

37:46.280 --> 37:47.682
<i>While heading down the river?</i>

37:47.782 --> 37:51.477
<i>Heave ho, off we go</i>

37:51.577 --> 37:53.437
<i>I'm Blue and very cool</i>

37:53.537 --> 37:55.648
<i>I'll take some risks,
but I'm no fool</i>

37:55.748 --> 37:57.275
<i>Playing safe is still the rule</i>

37:57.375 --> 37:58.818
<i>While sailing to adventure</i>

37:58.918 --> 38:00.528
<i>Heave ho</i>

38:00.628 --> 38:02.530
<i>Off we go</i>

38:02.630 --> 38:05.741
<i>It's time to save the day</i>

38:05.841 --> 38:08.035
<i>From the giant</i>

38:08.135 --> 38:13.624
<i>Who's trying to take our colors away</i>

38:13.724 --> 38:15.543
<i>My color's White, my time will come</i>

38:15.643 --> 38:17.795
<i>When it's my turn to have some fun</i>

38:17.895 --> 38:20.923
<i>Right now I'm a little numb
Feeling kind of queasy</i>

38:21.023 --> 38:24.844
<i>Heave ho, off we go</i>

38:24.944 --> 38:26.887
<i>My brother White,
you've got it wrong</i>

38:26.987 --> 38:28.806
<i>Listen to Black, before too long</i>

38:28.906 --> 38:30.474
<i>We won't be here to sing this song</i>

38:30.574 --> 38:32.059
<i>We're headed for disaster</i>

38:32.159 --> 38:35.813
<i>Heave ho, off we go</i>

38:35.913 --> 38:38.441
<i>It's time to save the day</i>

38:38.541 --> 38:41.277
- Hooray.
- <i>From the giant</i>

38:41.377 --> 38:46.574
<i>Who's trying to take our colors away</i>

38:46.674 --> 38:48.909
<i>Who says, Black? We cannot fail</i>

38:49.009 --> 38:50.870
<i>I'm tough and strong
Red will prevail</i>

38:50.970 --> 38:52.580
<i>Oops, I think I've chipped a nail</i>

38:52.680 --> 38:54.206
<i>So call the paramedics!</i>

38:54.306 --> 38:58.252
<i>Heave ho, off we go</i>

38:58.352 --> 39:00.129
<i>I'm worried and I fear</i>

39:00.229 --> 39:02.381
<i>I'm Yellow, and to be right here</i>

39:02.481 --> 39:06.927
<i>With danger lurking very near
It's not what I intended</i>

39:07.027 --> 39:10.639
It's not. It's really not.

39:10.739 --> 39:14.518
<i>Heave ho, off we go</i>

39:14.618 --> 39:18.272
<i>- It's time to save the day</i>
- Hooray!

39:18.372 --> 39:20.149
<i>From the giant</i>

39:20.249 --> 39:25.529
<i>Who's trying to take our colors away</i>

39:25.629 --> 39:29.492
<i>So, heave ho, off we go</i>

39:29.592 --> 39:33.120
<i>It's time to save the day</i>

39:33.220 --> 39:34.997
<i>From the giant</i>

39:35.097 --> 39:40.419
<i>Who's trying to take our colors away</i>

39:40.519 --> 39:44.048
<i>He can't take our colors away</i>

39:44.148 --> 39:47.760
<i>No, he won't take our colors away</i>

39:47.860 --> 39:52.181
<i>'Cause we're here to save the day!</i>

39:56.285 --> 39:58.104
My theory seems to be...

39:58.204 --> 40:01.190
I believe the proper
terminology would be...

40:01.290 --> 40:03.241
correct-o-mundo!

40:04.752 --> 40:07.745
Oh, this is not good.
Not good at all.

40:09.215 --> 40:13.119
I'd invite you to take a look,
but it seems my ocular orb

40:13.219 --> 40:16.747
has become somewhat fastened
to this contraption...

40:16.847 --> 40:18.131
Qu'est que c'est?

40:18.557 --> 40:20.883
He means his eye is stuck.

40:26.899 --> 40:30.553
Oh, thank you,
nice Cowboy Man and Pink Lady.

40:30.653 --> 40:32.430
There must have been...

40:32.530 --> 40:35.641
suction created with
the surface tension

40:35.741 --> 40:38.811
when my eyeball came in
contact with the curvature

40:38.911 --> 40:42.273
of the eyepiece lens,
causing the predicament that,

40:42.373 --> 40:45.109
with your application of
continuous gyration and torque

40:45.209 --> 40:49.071
was finally broken,
allowing me to esca...

40:51.006 --> 40:53.040
Glad we could help, Professor.

40:57.137 --> 40:58.205
Just what I feared.

40:58.305 --> 41:01.083
That varmint is blocking
up the rainbow!

41:01.183 --> 41:04.010
Here, take a look-see.

41:04.562 --> 41:07.715
Zut alors! A chroma-tastrophe.

41:07.815 --> 41:13.512
If this continues, we shall
soon be mere silhouettes!

41:13.612 --> 41:17.266
I believe you are already
starting to fade.

41:17.366 --> 41:20.568
And you don't have
your usual rosy glow.

41:21.829 --> 41:24.231
Oh, well, this isn't
my usual eyeball,

41:24.331 --> 41:28.486
but our heroes are
coming to a bifurcation!

41:31.964 --> 41:33.199
Hey! Which way?

41:36.093 --> 41:38.662
Let me see...

41:38.762 --> 41:40.247
We need to make a decision here.

41:40.347 --> 41:42.833
It says "Danger!"

41:42.933 --> 41:45.336
- Almost there.
- Go left.

41:45.436 --> 41:47.213
- Left?
- Right.

41:47.313 --> 41:49.215
- Right? You said left.
- I meant correct.

41:49.315 --> 41:51.050
- Go left.
- Left. You sure?

41:51.150 --> 41:52.676
- Right.
- Right right?

41:52.776 --> 41:54.303
- Or correct right?
- Right right!

41:54.403 --> 41:56.722
- Make up your mind!
- Left!

41:56.822 --> 41:58.898
Okay, turning left!

41:59.325 --> 42:01.609
Oops...

42:04.788 --> 42:07.775
- Right.
- Okay.

42:07.875 --> 42:11.028
- Where are we?
- According to the map,

42:11.128 --> 42:15.164
we're heading down the Scary Narrows.

42:17.886 --> 42:21.080
- The rapids!
- Hang on tight!

42:22.848 --> 42:24.708
What do we do now?

42:24.808 --> 42:27.885
We end up in Davy Jones's
school supplies.

42:29.563 --> 42:31.131
Oh, no.

42:31.231 --> 42:34.468
We have to stay
inside the shorelines.

42:34.568 --> 42:37.346
Blue! Give the wheel to Green!

42:37.446 --> 42:39.515
- Me?
- Him?

42:39.615 --> 42:42.775
He's the best at
staying in the lines.

42:57.633 --> 42:59.159
That's not cool!

42:59.259 --> 43:01.370
The lines are getting
too close together!

43:01.470 --> 43:03.038
We'll never make it.

43:03.138 --> 43:05.131
We're doomed.

43:17.236 --> 43:20.222
I landed on my keys.

43:20.322 --> 43:23.642
Oh! I'm still in one piece!

43:23.742 --> 43:27.187
You dodged the whole thing!
You saved us!

43:27.287 --> 43:30.399
Well, it only goes to
show that sometimes,

43:30.499 --> 43:34.320
you just have to color
outside the lines.

43:34.420 --> 43:36.572
Way to go, Green!

43:36.672 --> 43:39.783
Well, thank you,
but I can't take all the credit.

43:39.883 --> 43:41.535
It was Yellow's idea.

43:41.635 --> 43:43.579
It sure was.

43:43.679 --> 43:47.374
That was some fast thinking.

43:48.649 --> 43:51.587
Green, I think you forgot
your sunscreen there.

43:51.687 --> 43:52.755
What?

43:52.855 --> 43:54.632
You've got tan-lines.

43:54.732 --> 43:56.175
I do?

43:56.275 --> 43:58.969
Well, I've never had them before.

44:00.085 --> 44:01.397
You do too, Red.

44:01.497 --> 44:04.516
- What?
- I'm going a bit gray myself.

44:04.616 --> 44:07.770
- Oh, no!
- What is it?

44:07.870 --> 44:11.482
These aren't tan lines.
We're starting to fade.

44:11.582 --> 44:14.951
That can only mean one thing.

44:18.464 --> 44:21.408
What do you think it'll be like
when we have color, boss?

44:21.508 --> 44:23.494
I think I'd like to have polka dots.

44:23.594 --> 44:25.621
Or maybe I could be plaid!

44:25.721 --> 44:27.831
I bet Lois would go out
with me if I was plaid.

44:27.931 --> 44:30.793
Girls love straight
lines crisscrossing, crisscrossing.

44:30.893 --> 44:32.378
Make you look handsome.

44:32.478 --> 44:33.411
What?

44:33.937 --> 44:36.590
Oh! Great work,
your Royal Brawniness.

44:36.690 --> 44:40.226
Keep this up and we'll
be done in no time!

44:54.750 --> 44:59.488
Hey, you're not gonna let some
spooky unnatural fog scare you?

44:59.588 --> 45:02.282
Anything could be in that fog.

45:02.382 --> 45:09.964
Any kind of creepy, crawly,
ookie, slimy monster.

45:11.141 --> 45:13.460
I'll take the lead.

45:13.560 --> 45:15.963
Let's go everybody.

45:18.607 --> 45:22.636
What is this place?
Everything's so glum.

45:22.736 --> 45:25.681
Yeah, makes Black look
downright cheery.

45:25.781 --> 45:27.273
Ha.

45:28.492 --> 45:30.811
You're always so brave, Blue.

45:30.911 --> 45:33.814
How do you do it? What's your secret?

45:33.914 --> 45:35.399
No secret.

45:35.499 --> 45:37.568
But you're never afraid.

45:37.668 --> 45:39.486
That's what you think.

45:39.586 --> 45:41.363
I've got the heebie-jeebies
right now.

45:41.463 --> 45:43.782
You do? But you don't show it.

45:43.882 --> 45:47.536
Oh. Well, maybe that's the secret.

45:51.258 --> 45:55.002
Creepy crawlies! Yellow was right.

45:56.086 --> 45:57.663
Go back!

45:57.963 --> 45:59.798
Go away!

45:59.898 --> 46:04.219
You are not welcome here.

46:04.319 --> 46:06.305
Come any closer and we'll leave you

46:06.405 --> 46:09.141
on the dashboard of a hot car!

46:09.241 --> 46:13.061
I always knew I'd end up melted
by spooky disembodied voices.

46:13.961 --> 46:16.690
I'm not afraid of any fog creature...

46:16.790 --> 46:18.108
much.

46:18.208 --> 46:20.402
Come on out! I dare you!

46:20.502 --> 46:22.738
I double dog dare you!

46:26.925 --> 46:29.369
And don't come back. Moo.

46:29.469 --> 46:30.836
Moo?

46:34.725 --> 46:37.377
Something smells fishy.

46:37.477 --> 46:40.380
Blue must have forgotten
to change his socks again.

46:40.480 --> 46:42.424
I mean something's not right.

46:42.524 --> 46:44.301
Someone's gotta sneak back.

46:44.401 --> 46:47.930
What? Behind enemy lines?

46:48.030 --> 46:49.932
Ha. I'll do it!

46:50.032 --> 46:53.143
No. White has to go.

46:53.243 --> 46:55.062
- Alone.
- Me?!

46:55.162 --> 46:56.772
Why me?

46:56.872 --> 46:58.440
Look at you.

46:58.540 --> 47:03.070
You're naturally camouflaged.
You'll blend right in.

47:03.170 --> 47:07.324
I know this is hard to do.
Believe me, I know.

47:07.424 --> 47:09.326
But we need you.

47:09.426 --> 47:13.170
You need... me?

47:14.556 --> 47:18.544
Wow, you guys need me.

47:18.644 --> 47:21.004
This is my moment to shine.

47:21.104 --> 47:22.805
I'll do it!

47:43.835 --> 47:47.114
- Was I okay?
- You were great.

47:47.214 --> 47:49.324
What about me? Did I overplay it?

47:49.424 --> 47:52.369
No, no. I really liked
the "or else" part.

47:52.469 --> 47:54.788
It implied consequences.

47:54.888 --> 47:56.832
Perilous consequences.

47:56.932 --> 47:59.251
- Moo.
- Yeah, Cow.

47:59.351 --> 48:02.170
I really felt the complexity
of your backstory

48:02.270 --> 48:05.299
and the emotional shading
of your delivery.

48:05.399 --> 48:07.259
Why, you're not monsters!

48:09.027 --> 48:11.103
What?

48:13.065 --> 48:13.974
Boo?

48:14.074 --> 48:14.975
Moo!

48:15.075 --> 48:18.152
Fellas, it was a trick.

48:18.912 --> 48:22.107
No, no, no. We really are monsters!

48:22.207 --> 48:24.151
Yeah, I... I'm a dragon.

48:24.251 --> 48:26.194
Fierce, vicious.

48:26.294 --> 48:28.047
Very scary.

48:29.580 --> 48:30.998
Not so hard!

48:34.511 --> 48:36.830
So this was the menace?

48:36.930 --> 48:40.375
You bovine buffoon!
You lactose lunatic!

48:40.475 --> 48:42.085
- You...
- Moo.

48:42.185 --> 48:45.756
White! You were wonderful.

48:45.856 --> 48:48.008
As Brown would say...

48:48.108 --> 48:51.511
"Aww, shucks, ma'am.
T'wern't nothin'."

48:51.611 --> 48:55.766
Okay, you know, 'fess up.
Who are you guys?

48:55.866 --> 48:58.226
We're, we're...

48:58.326 --> 49:00.479
We're unfinished drawings.

49:00.579 --> 49:03.857
The unfinished.
The not-quite-good-enough.

49:03.957 --> 49:08.362
The ones that never made it
on Ben's wall or Mom's fridge.

49:08.462 --> 49:11.573
Most of us don't even have names.

49:11.673 --> 49:13.575
- I'm Duck. This is Cow.
- Moo.

49:13.675 --> 49:16.119
Everyone calls me Bumble Bee.

49:16.219 --> 49:18.914
- Astronaut.
- Horse.

49:19.014 --> 49:20.630
He's Race Car.

49:21.141 --> 49:23.335
Pathetic, right?

49:23.435 --> 49:25.128
My name's Ricky...

49:25.228 --> 49:27.464
But... but, I'm...
I'm not exactly sure why.

49:27.564 --> 49:29.341
You live here?

49:31.777 --> 49:35.305
What he means is nobody
wants to hang out with us.

49:35.405 --> 49:37.432
Moo, moo.

49:37.532 --> 49:41.061
Besides, we have to hide here.

49:41.161 --> 49:44.272
If we don't, "it" might find us.

49:46.458 --> 49:50.153
"It?" What's... it?

49:50.253 --> 49:52.155
The Great Waste.

49:52.255 --> 49:56.785
A terrible creature that
eats unfinished drawings.

49:57.135 --> 50:00.706
Eats... drawings?

50:00.806 --> 50:04.167
Yup. Stinger, wings,
cute little chef's hat...

50:04.267 --> 50:07.796
He'd make a bee-lightful
tuna sandwich out of me!

50:07.896 --> 50:10.464
Get a grip, bumble-boy.

50:11.066 --> 50:14.761
Come on, gang, we've got
our own monster to fight.

50:14.861 --> 50:17.472
Maybe we'll catch you
on the way back.

50:17.572 --> 50:20.183
How do we get out of here?

50:23.245 --> 50:25.772
We're west of Eraser Mesa.

50:25.872 --> 50:29.609
No, no, no, avoid that place.
You'll get rubbed out.

50:29.709 --> 50:32.779
We could head towards Glueisiana.

50:32.879 --> 50:34.614
You don't want to get stuck there.

50:34.714 --> 50:36.825
How about cutting
through Pencilvania?

50:36.925 --> 50:38.535
Oh, what's the point?

50:39.669 --> 50:42.956
Well, what do you suggest?

50:43.056 --> 50:45.375
The quickest way is
across the Wasteland.

50:45.475 --> 50:47.753
- We can take you.
- But it's a desert!

50:47.853 --> 50:49.629
We'll never make it. It's too hot.

50:49.729 --> 50:53.300
- We'll melt!
- Hot? You betcha.

50:53.400 --> 50:56.261
But it's also our home.
We can get you across.

50:56.361 --> 50:58.638
But, we'll have to go fast!

50:58.738 --> 51:00.223
Fast?

51:13.795 --> 51:17.115
Hey, this is kinda fun!

51:17.215 --> 51:21.244
In fact... I love this!

51:34.274 --> 51:35.801
We're here.

51:35.901 --> 51:38.720
- Here?
- This is Rubber Band Ridge.

51:38.820 --> 51:42.349
From here, it's just a quick shot
to the top of the mountain.

51:42.449 --> 51:44.351
We'll show you how.

51:44.451 --> 51:47.479
I do wish there was something
we could do for you guys.

51:47.579 --> 51:50.690
Maybe we can.

51:50.790 --> 51:52.442
What do you mean?

51:52.542 --> 51:54.736
We could color our friends.

51:54.836 --> 51:57.155
Coloring? Now?

51:57.255 --> 51:58.990
Plus we're already fading.

51:59.090 --> 52:01.785
If you ask me, we don't
have any color to spare.

52:01.885 --> 52:04.246
And don't forget about
the big scary monster

52:04.346 --> 52:07.749
and his... flying thing.

52:07.849 --> 52:09.751
I know we still have
a long way to go,

52:09.851 --> 52:11.837
but it's the right thing to do.

52:11.937 --> 52:15.764
The drawings helped us.
It's our turn to help them.

52:17.400 --> 52:20.470
- Well...
- I'm a crayon.

52:20.570 --> 52:22.973
Coloring is what I do.

52:23.073 --> 52:26.059
This is my destiny.

52:26.159 --> 52:29.479
And that cow needs some white!

52:29.579 --> 52:33.900
- Moo, moo?
- And some black, too.

52:50.267 --> 52:53.086
See? It hardly takes a second.

52:53.186 --> 52:55.297
There. Now you're a palomino.

53:00.068 --> 53:02.304
How about adding a little
oomph to that fire!

53:04.030 --> 53:06.600
What's a Mallard without
green feathers?

53:07.200 --> 53:10.979
And a racecar without a slick
paint job is just a rust bucket.

53:11.329 --> 53:14.608
<i>Whenever I'm looking
for something to do</i>

53:14.708 --> 53:17.903
<i>A story brings me in</i>

53:18.003 --> 53:20.363
<i>Away from the things
that make me afraid</i>

53:20.463 --> 53:23.749
<i>And then I can begin</i>

53:24.801 --> 53:30.624
<i>You see, it's me
My magic's coming through</i>

53:30.724 --> 53:33.543
<i>Color the world</i>

53:33.643 --> 53:36.880
<i>The greatest thing to do</i>

53:38.773 --> 53:41.134
<i>Drawing our stories
we like to explore</i>

53:41.234 --> 53:44.054
<i>With color and with style</i>

53:44.154 --> 53:46.973
<i>Led by our feelings
and through every door</i>

53:47.073 --> 53:50.526
<i>We're finding our own smiles</i>

53:51.244 --> 53:54.064
<i>Let's sing and dance</i>

53:54.164 --> 53:57.275
<i>Our magic never ends</i>

53:57.375 --> 54:00.028
<i>Color the world</i>

54:00.128 --> 54:10.796
<i>It's better with our friends</i>

54:12.724 --> 54:15.794
<i>Better with our, better with our</i>

54:16.872 --> 54:19.256
<i>Friends</i>

54:19.356 --> 54:22.175
Houston, we don't have a problem!

54:23.485 --> 54:25.762
I am bee-utiful!

54:27.697 --> 54:29.432
Hot stuff comin' through!

54:29.532 --> 54:32.519
Oh, I wish we had the
words to thank you.

54:38.166 --> 54:41.903
Bee-cisely, we're all
utterly grateful.

54:45.654 --> 54:48.159
She does have a way with words.

54:48.259 --> 54:49.911
Are you guys gonna be all right?

54:50.011 --> 54:51.955
I think so, Ducky-Duck.

54:52.055 --> 54:54.624
We would have liked to give
you even brighter colors,

54:54.724 --> 54:56.918
but we are getting
paler by the minute.

54:57.018 --> 54:59.337
And we've only minutes to spare.

55:02.607 --> 55:05.510
Well, then, let's get moving.

55:05.610 --> 55:08.555
Are you guys sure about this?

55:08.655 --> 55:10.140
Unless you know how to fly,

55:10.240 --> 55:12.684
this is the fastest way to the top.

55:12.784 --> 55:16.354
I always knew we'd end up
being launched into oblivion.

55:17.622 --> 55:18.857
Five...

55:18.957 --> 55:23.557
four, three, two, one.

55:23.657 --> 55:24.775
Blast off!

55:37.767 --> 55:40.462
Help me. Someone. Hurry!

55:40.562 --> 55:41.838
I'm stuck in a rock.

55:51.448 --> 55:53.641
Zaaam.

55:53.741 --> 55:56.360
Zam good or Zam bad?

55:57.704 --> 55:58.945
Zaaam!

55:59.664 --> 56:03.860
He and that flying thing are hoarding
all the color for themselves!

56:05.920 --> 56:07.572
What is that guy, anyway?

56:07.672 --> 56:09.866
- Some sort of a bat?
- I don't know.

56:09.966 --> 56:12.118
There are creeps and there are jerks,

56:12.218 --> 56:15.580
but this guy, he's a real creep-jerk!

56:15.680 --> 56:19.626
- How do we stop him?
- He is stronger than us.

56:19.726 --> 56:22.587
He is meaner than us!
He is badder than us.

56:22.687 --> 56:24.881
We got to have a plan.

56:24.981 --> 56:27.258
Plan? Good idea.

56:27.358 --> 56:30.261
- What's the plan?
- Don't know.

56:30.361 --> 56:32.972
Planning is not my thing, dig?

56:33.072 --> 56:36.434
Maybe we can distract him long
enough to destroy the dam?

56:36.534 --> 56:39.562
And how do we do that?

56:39.662 --> 56:44.526
Well... one of us will
have to act as bait.

56:44.626 --> 56:47.529
And I know just who that should be.

56:47.629 --> 56:49.697
- Yellow.
- Exactly.

56:49.797 --> 56:51.950
What? Wait, me?

56:52.050 --> 56:54.577
Blue... are you sure?

56:54.677 --> 56:56.329
Absolutely.

56:56.429 --> 56:59.249
We gotta think outside the
crayon-box on this one!

56:59.349 --> 57:02.877
He chased her around Color City.
I bet he'll follow her again.

57:02.977 --> 57:05.880
Besides, I believe in you, Yellow.

57:05.980 --> 57:08.925
Maybe it's time you
believed in yourself.

57:09.025 --> 57:12.137
I... I believe in me, too.

57:12.237 --> 57:16.690
I can do it!

57:17.784 --> 57:19.804
I can't do it!

57:21.204 --> 57:24.441
What was I thinking,
coming here on my own?

57:24.541 --> 57:26.109
I'll never change.

57:26.209 --> 57:29.870
I'm yellow. Yellow,
yellow to the core.

57:31.631 --> 57:33.700
I'll just sit here. That's it.

57:33.800 --> 57:36.161
I'll sit here on this
rock for a while,

57:36.261 --> 57:39.330
then go back and tell them
I couldn't find Scrawl.

57:39.430 --> 57:42.584
I'll just say I got
lost in this snow.

57:42.684 --> 57:43.751
Snow?

57:43.851 --> 57:47.172
This isn't snow. It's...

57:47.272 --> 57:49.598
P... P... paper!

57:50.858 --> 57:54.596
Eeek! The.. the... the Great Waste!

57:56.189 --> 58:00.692
Help, help, help! Help, help, help!

58:21.806 --> 58:24.125
That's it, your Royal Chop-Sockiness!

58:24.225 --> 58:25.793
Wax on, wax off!

58:42.368 --> 58:46.856
Yeah, you better run,
you Trashosaurus Rex!

58:46.956 --> 58:48.698
You saved me.

58:49.584 --> 58:50.568
Why?

58:54.380 --> 58:55.990
We tried to tell you.

58:56.090 --> 58:58.451
All we ever wanted was some color.

58:58.551 --> 59:00.537
Without it, we're just...

59:00.637 --> 59:04.422
Unfinished drawings.

59:10.438 --> 59:11.923
You helped me.

59:12.023 --> 59:13.716
Now it's my turn to help you.

59:21.491 --> 59:27.355
There. Now you truly are King Scrawl.

59:27.455 --> 59:29.857
Thank you.

59:29.957 --> 59:32.860
You're welcome,
but we're almost out of color.

59:32.960 --> 59:35.280
We have to get the
colorfall flowing again.

59:35.380 --> 59:38.658
This is my fault. I was being greedy.

59:38.758 --> 59:41.494
I never meant to cause you any harm.

59:41.594 --> 59:43.788
The dam must come down right away.

59:43.888 --> 59:46.583
But your Royal Clogginess,
the dam is too strong

59:46.683 --> 59:48.501
for us to knock down by ourselves.

59:48.601 --> 59:50.253
My friends will help.

59:50.353 --> 59:52.463
Oh, I'm not so sure about that.

59:52.563 --> 59:55.265
I think the other crayons
are afraid of me.

59:56.150 --> 59:57.343
I'll explain.

59:57.443 --> 59:59.596
It was all a big misunderstanding.

59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.097
You'll see.

01:00:05.576 --> 01:00:08.479
I knew this Rubber Bandolero
would come in handy.

01:00:08.579 --> 01:00:10.148
We'll stretch it across the canyon,

01:00:10.248 --> 01:00:12.066
and when Scrawl gets near...

01:00:12.166 --> 01:00:15.153
Whammo! We get him.

01:00:15.253 --> 01:00:19.532
Signal! Signal! Bird sounds!

01:00:19.632 --> 01:00:21.534
That's the signal. Here they come!

01:00:21.634 --> 01:00:24.586
Places everyone. It's show time!

01:00:29.434 --> 01:00:31.628
Hello? Guys?

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:36.299
Everything's okay.
Olly olly auburn-free!

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:38.850
They must be around here somewhere.

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:43.139
Now!

01:00:45.199 --> 01:00:46.517
It's a trap!

01:00:46.617 --> 01:00:48.728
I knew it, your Sitting Duckliness.

01:00:48.828 --> 01:00:50.605
No, wait!

01:00:50.705 --> 01:00:52.899
We should never have
followed her into Color City.

01:00:52.999 --> 01:00:55.860
An ambush. And I trusted you.

01:00:56.922 --> 01:00:58.388
Get me down from here.

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:02.659
I don't think I can,
your Upside Downliness.

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:05.536
I can only make paper cuts,
and this thing is rubber.

01:01:05.636 --> 01:01:07.955
Please, listen to me!

01:01:08.055 --> 01:01:09.957
You know him?

01:01:11.267 --> 01:01:14.921
You led him to Color City?

01:01:15.021 --> 01:01:16.464
Well, not exactly...

01:01:16.564 --> 01:01:18.216
And how come he can speak?

01:01:18.316 --> 01:01:21.344
Did you draw him a mouth?

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:24.472
- Yes, but he...
- Whose side are you on, Yellow?

01:01:24.572 --> 01:01:27.350
Wait, listen...

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.477
Just stay out of our way, Yellow.

01:01:29.577 --> 01:01:32.647
- Haven't you done enough?
- Please, please.

01:01:32.747 --> 01:01:34.899
You don't understand.

01:01:34.999 --> 01:01:38.326
You're right. We don't.

01:01:42.715 --> 01:01:47.829
Pardon my language, but you,
sir, are a Grade-A poopy pants.

01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:52.417
Poopy pants? Well,
that's awfully harsh, don't you think?

01:01:52.517 --> 01:01:55.294
So what'll we do with them now?

01:01:55.394 --> 01:01:58.089
Gee, I don't know.
Planning's not my thing.

01:01:58.189 --> 01:01:59.716
I think I mentioned that.

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:02.009
Anyone got an idea?

01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:06.222
Let's make him into a great big
paper pinata, and whammo!

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:10.226
Yes! That sounds both
appropriate and timely.

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:13.312
Well, then... Charge!

01:02:14.914 --> 01:02:17.574
This doesn't look good,
your Punching Bagliness.

01:02:18.459 --> 01:02:19.910
Stop!

01:02:25.383 --> 01:02:27.702
Leave him alone!

01:02:27.802 --> 01:02:30.246
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:33.166
Siding with the monster again?!

01:02:33.266 --> 01:02:37.295
Stop calling him that!
He's not a monster! He's a king.

01:02:41.107 --> 01:02:43.009
Very nice landing.

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.011
Wha...?

01:02:45.111 --> 01:02:47.145
And he saved my life.

01:02:50.116 --> 01:02:52.852
- What?
- He did?

01:02:52.952 --> 01:02:57.315
He's good and kind and all
he wants is some color.

01:02:57.415 --> 01:03:00.151
We never gave him
a chance to explain.

01:03:00.251 --> 01:03:03.738
We judged him because we were afraid.

01:03:03.838 --> 01:03:06.365
I was afraid, too.

01:03:06.465 --> 01:03:08.242
But not anymore.

01:03:08.342 --> 01:03:10.787
Oh. Zam.

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:14.540
Gee...

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.292
We...

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:21.714
Well, I... I suppose, in light
of this new information...

01:03:21.814 --> 01:03:24.634
We've all acted like jerks.

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:27.011
Yeah. Creep-jerks.

01:03:27.111 --> 01:03:29.771
And I am the worst offender of all.

01:03:30.197 --> 01:03:32.232
Will you forgive me?

01:03:40.791 --> 01:03:44.195
I'm sorry. A happy ending
gets me every time.

01:03:44.295 --> 01:03:45.947
It's not over yet.

01:03:46.047 --> 01:03:48.366
We've still got important work to do.

01:03:48.466 --> 01:03:50.576
And very little time.

01:03:55.973 --> 01:03:59.836
Colors are runnin' faster than a
red sock in a washing machine.

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:03.965
It is the end. Le coup de grace!

01:04:04.065 --> 01:04:08.768
Soon we will be saying
au revoir, mon ami.

01:04:11.739 --> 01:04:14.976
My fade-o-meter
tells me that we are now

01:04:15.076 --> 01:04:18.646
only 15.6 percent
of our original color

01:04:18.746 --> 01:04:21.399
and dimming with alacrity!

01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:26.737
There, there. It ain't over
till the fat crayon sings.

01:04:31.717 --> 01:04:34.836
Spoke too soon.

01:04:37.181 --> 01:04:38.416
Heave!

01:04:38.516 --> 01:04:39.417
Ho!

01:04:39.517 --> 01:04:42.253
- Heave!
- Ho!!

01:04:42.353 --> 01:04:43.379
Heave!

01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:45.089
Ho!

01:04:45.189 --> 01:04:48.092
- It won't budge!
- We need more help!

01:04:48.192 --> 01:04:50.636
There's no one else. It's up to us.

01:04:50.736 --> 01:04:53.180
Not quite, your Royal Mistakenliness.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.975
I have brought reinforcements.

01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:00.229
What was that?

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:01.939
Sounds like the cavalry!

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:10.615
I've always had a way with
giant terrestrial vertebrates.

01:05:13.426 --> 01:05:16.961
Hey, this way.

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:25.379
- Yeah.
- Okay, big fella.

01:05:25.479 --> 01:05:27.840
Get ready to pull.

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:29.759
All right, everybody. On three.

01:05:29.859 --> 01:05:31.969
One!

01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:33.137
Two!

01:05:33.237 --> 01:05:34.805
Three!

01:05:35.005 --> 01:05:36.981
Heave!

01:06:02.516 --> 01:06:04.592
Yeah!

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:16.013
Hue, shade, tint,
saturation are all returning!

01:06:16.113 --> 01:06:18.766
It seems appropriate to
interject at this juncture

01:06:18.866 --> 01:06:21.268
a hearty hoo-ha!

01:06:21.968 --> 01:06:24.313
Those rapscallions did it!

01:06:24.413 --> 01:06:26.399
Yee-haw!

01:06:26.499 --> 01:06:28.491
C'est manifique!

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.676
Shucks, ma'am.

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:36.409
Spontaneous osculation,

01:06:36.509 --> 01:06:38.703
reaction of embarrassment
combined with a measure

01:06:38.803 --> 01:06:41.247
of bashful delight. Oh, very good.

01:06:41.347 --> 01:06:43.791
Very good, indeed.

01:06:47.686 --> 01:06:48.754
Stay cool!

01:06:48.854 --> 01:06:51.424
If you can get us back to
Color City right away,

01:06:51.524 --> 01:06:53.050
I think there's enough time.

01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:55.143
Very possibly.

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:10.693
Looking good, your Royal Highness.

01:07:11.593 --> 01:07:13.112
As do you, my trusty...

01:07:13.212 --> 01:07:15.614
What are you, anyway?

01:07:15.714 --> 01:07:18.242
Bug, bird, bat...

01:07:18.342 --> 01:07:20.745
It doesn't matter when
you look this good!

01:07:20.845 --> 01:07:23.414
And you have great friends.

01:07:23.514 --> 01:07:25.458
You know, I debated about pinstripes,

01:07:25.558 --> 01:07:28.085
but it's not really the season.
Maybe this winter.

01:07:28.185 --> 01:07:30.967
I don't know. Tweed's the...

01:07:31.197 --> 01:07:35.676
Folks, we owe our heroes
a great big ball of thanks.

01:07:35.776 --> 01:07:38.179
And none more so than Yella.

01:07:38.279 --> 01:07:42.641
So, little miss, the highest
award we can bestow:

01:07:42.741 --> 01:07:46.020
The Color Wheel of Honor.

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.647
Professor, the medal, please.

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:52.985
Oh, no, no, that's not it.

01:07:53.085 --> 01:07:54.570
Oh, how did that get in there?

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:58.115
This? No. Oh, my, this isn't mine.

01:07:58.215 --> 01:08:01.827
Oh, is that a gelatin marsupial?
I wonder if it's still good.

01:08:01.927 --> 01:08:04.663
Nope, not good!
No, it's awf... Oh, wait.

01:08:04.763 --> 01:08:07.792
Oh, bingo! Here it is!

01:08:07.892 --> 01:08:11.045
I knew it was here all along,
it was just at the bottom...

01:08:12.563 --> 01:08:16.133
You truly are the Hero of Color City.

01:08:32.917 --> 01:08:36.529
Sorry, folks,
this square dance is over.

01:08:36.629 --> 01:08:39.490
- Ben is waking up in five...
- Hurry, folks!

01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:41.992
- four...
- After you.

01:08:42.091 --> 01:08:43.828
three...

01:08:43.928 --> 01:08:45.877
two...

01:09:06.283 --> 01:09:07.935
Whoa!

01:09:08.035 --> 01:09:10.563
When did I...

01:09:10.662 --> 01:09:13.406
Cool!

01:09:22.966 --> 01:09:25.703
I am bee-utiful!

01:09:27.971 --> 01:09:30.291
Houston, we don't have a problem.

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:32.084
Hot stuff comin' through!

01:09:32.184 --> 01:09:34.545
Oh, I wish we had the
words to thank you.

01:11:42.022 --> 01:11:44.174
Ooh, hey, Ricky.
I wonder if there's a way

01:11:44.274 --> 01:11:46.010
to share crayons with
children who might not have

01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:49.847
- any of their own.
- Oh. What about recycling?

01:11:49.947 --> 01:11:52.808
Really? Recycle crayons? How?

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:55.477
Kids, parents and teachers
can collect used,

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:58.063
but still good crayons.
Then the Crayon Collection

01:11:58.163 --> 01:12:01.108
will help find them new homes
with other boys and girls.

01:12:01.208 --> 01:12:02.901
Sounds easy-peasy.

01:12:03.001 --> 01:12:05.404
Yup. Just go to crayoncollection.org

01:12:05.504 --> 01:12:07.239
and click on the "recycle" button

01:12:07.339 --> 01:12:09.908
to start saving crayons
for kids everywhere.

01:12:10.008 --> 01:12:12.828
And more crayons mean more drawings.

01:12:12.928 --> 01:12:15.372
Like us!

01:16:37.693 --> 01:16:40.853
I finally made it.
