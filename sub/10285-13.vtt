WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:04.738
Previously on E.R.:

00:04.772 --> 00:06.340
If we're gonna do this,

00:06.374 --> 00:08.309
we're gonna have
to do this together.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.577
GATES:
Remembering a dream
I had last night.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.545
Sam was in it.
I don't beg.

00:11.579 --> 00:12.746
In my dream you did.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.482
This is Ortho.
Yeah, I start today.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.716
Dr. Rasgotra,
I'd like you to meet

00:15.749 --> 00:17.751
Drs. Ramsey, Craig...
Hey.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.387
Heard great
things about you.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.322
What position did you play?
Center forward.

00:21.355 --> 00:24.725
Love, trust, truth...
higher power.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.727
You can't have any
of those without faith

00:26.760 --> 00:27.795
Especially love.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.230
So this is your office?

00:29.263 --> 00:31.199
Mm-hmm.
(buttons scatter)

00:33.767 --> 00:35.035
Nice desk.

00:40.108 --> 00:43.677
Oh! Imagine waking up
here every morning.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.213
Betina, I can't afford this.

00:45.246 --> 00:48.116
Yes, you can.
I did the math.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.750
You did the math?

00:49.783 --> 00:52.720
Mm-hmm. Time to move out of
your med school apartment

00:52.753 --> 00:54.155
and invest in something.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.756
My apartment is fine.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.158
So what do you think?

00:57.191 --> 00:59.627
Oh, it's beautiful.
Told you.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.230
The sellers did a great
job on the renovation.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.432
The kitchen,
the moldings,

01:04.465 --> 01:06.300
these yummy floors.

01:06.334 --> 01:07.868
Bamboo flown in from Brazil.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.503
And there's a gym,

01:09.537 --> 01:11.572
and a children's game room
in the basement.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.740
Do you two have kids?

01:12.773 --> 01:14.142
No.
No.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.543
Listen,
don't rush it.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.478
When you're newlyweds
and it's just

01:17.511 --> 01:19.180
the two of you
against the world...

01:19.213 --> 01:21.549
Well, you can't beat it.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.651
Okay.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.353
It'll be gone by the end

01:25.386 --> 01:26.820
of the week, so if you're
at all interested,

01:26.854 --> 01:28.822
make an offer.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.224
No, thanks.

01:30.258 --> 01:31.792
It's, uh,

01:31.825 --> 01:33.327
the first place he's seen.

01:33.361 --> 01:34.528
Think about it.

01:34.562 --> 01:35.729
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.166
No. Don't, please.

01:38.866 --> 01:41.169
I'm just looking.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.804
GATES:
Hey, Sam!

01:43.837 --> 01:45.839
It wasn't just the battery.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.375
Where did you
get my keys?

01:47.408 --> 01:48.842
You also had alternator issues.
You stole

01:48.876 --> 01:50.811
my keys and fixed my car?
I think

01:50.844 --> 01:52.613
the proper response would be,
"Thank you, Tony."

01:52.646 --> 01:54.248
Also, I tightened

01:54.282 --> 01:55.583
the connections and got you
all charged up.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.817
SKYE:
Ooh...

01:56.850 --> 01:58.452
That sounds like fun.

01:58.486 --> 01:59.820
I thought you were
dating the chaplain.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.755
It's my car.
He's talking about my car.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.724
Car.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.759
She made a perfectly
reasonable assumption
about our relationship

02:05.793 --> 02:07.228
and you practically
had a seizure.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.729
I wasn't feeling
the realtor.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.298
I just wanted to get out
of there, that's all.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.832
We're adults, Greg.
The topic of commitment

02:11.865 --> 02:13.834
shouldn't be off-limits.
It's not off limits.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.569
Really? You haven't
looked me in the eye

02:15.603 --> 02:17.938
since we left that place.
Come on, it's not like that.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.541
SKYE:
Pratt!

02:20.574 --> 02:23.644
Pratt, there's a kid and an
old guy that have just been

02:23.677 --> 02:25.279
pulled out of the lake.
Take one with Grady.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.747
All right, you got it.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.549
Look, let's just talk
about this later.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.384
At least you're admitting
there's something to talk about.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.852
Hey, Chaz, how are you doing?

02:31.885 --> 02:34.222
Fine. Thanks.
What up?

02:34.222 --> 02:35.589
Robert Truman, 68.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.425
Jumped in after a kid
who fell into the lake.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.727
Thought I could get him,
but I was too cold.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.229
Heart rate's 68,
pulse ox good.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.596
Temp was 90 when
we pulled him out.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.864
My lungs froze up,
couldn't swim.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.366
Does anything hurt, sir?

02:45.399 --> 02:47.235
I'm fine.
Take care of the boy.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.936
Barely moving air.
Too cold, can't get a sat.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.838
"24 gauge PIV."
That's it?

02:50.871 --> 02:51.805
He needs central access.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.507
Mama's here, it's okay.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.576
This is your fault!
You made this happen!

02:55.609 --> 02:58.546
No, he needed my help.
I thought that I...

02:58.579 --> 03:00.814
Why won't you leave us alone?
Ma'am, is he allergic

03:00.848 --> 03:02.916
to any medication?
No, I'm sorry I tried to come...

03:02.950 --> 03:04.318
Stay away from my son!

03:04.352 --> 03:05.553
SAM:
He's hypoventilating.

03:05.586 --> 03:06.954
SKYE:
We need to bag him.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.789
Doctor, please take care
of that child.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.658
Sir, we're going to
concentrate on you right now.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.926
No, if you want to help me,
you need to help that boy.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.795
Mr. Truman, please.
Save him!

03:14.828 --> 03:17.965
Save him or I'm going to hell.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.074

03:26.607 --> 03:27.708
RASGOTRA:
The O.R. charge nurse
wants to bump

03:27.741 --> 03:28.676
our meniscus repair
until tomorrow.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.877
Tell her to kiss your ass.

03:29.910 --> 03:30.911
Maybe mine.
She's kind of cute.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.613
What's up, Ortho girl?

03:32.646 --> 03:33.881
Morris, what are
you doing here?

03:33.914 --> 03:35.783
I'm a surgeon for the day.
What?

03:35.816 --> 03:38.452
Yep-- it's the E.R.'s new
trauma exchange program.

03:38.486 --> 03:39.987
I never heard
anything about this.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.955
E.R. staff can spend a day
on the surgical service

03:41.989 --> 03:43.957
following trauma
patients to the O.R.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.393
Are you going
to scrub in on cases?

03:45.426 --> 03:46.860
Hope so.
Be good and, uh,

03:46.894 --> 03:48.296
Harold might let you
hold his retractor.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.831
Definitely!
(chuckles)

03:50.864 --> 03:53.534
Dude, I gotta go-- there's,
like, a hundred doctors here.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.735
After you.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.370
No, after you.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.472
Rasgotra, you're up.

03:58.506 --> 04:01.475
Silas is our "snowmobile
versus brick wall."

04:01.509 --> 04:03.411
Post op day one...
She's so cute, isn't she?

04:03.444 --> 04:04.945
Day one from laparotomy...

04:04.978 --> 04:06.580
With her little accent.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.750
Hemoglobin's stable,
slept well overnight.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.419
Got a chest X-ray
for a low-grade temp.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.753
No infiltrates,
mild atelectasis

04:12.786 --> 04:14.788
bilaterally.
Okay.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.589
That means little areas
of collapsed alveoli.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.358
We know what atelectasis is.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.692
It's probably nothing,

04:19.726 --> 04:21.394
but I can repeat
the film this afternoon.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.364
Okay.
Hey, what's the definition

04:23.397 --> 04:25.533
of a double blind study?

04:25.566 --> 04:27.000
Two Ortho docs
looking at a chest film.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.536
Ho!
Zing!

04:28.569 --> 04:29.870
(Trauma doctors snickering)

04:29.903 --> 04:31.372
Don't pretend that's
not funny, huh?

04:31.405 --> 04:33.474
You taught me that joke.
Oh, my God.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.542
I love this girl.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.876
(laughing)

04:35.909 --> 04:37.578
WOMAN:
He was collecting

04:37.611 --> 04:39.713
samples from the lake
for a science project.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.015
Something about algae
in winter.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.051
Core temp's 74.3.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.786
More suction, please.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.055
And then that man just appears
out of nowhere again.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.591
SKYE:
Tube.
He's been coming

04:50.624 --> 04:52.460
to the store trying to talk
to me while I was at work.

04:52.493 --> 04:55.563
I thought he was
just some lonely, old guy.

04:55.596 --> 04:58.532
And yesterday, I saw him
outside of my house.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.368
And when he saw me looking,
he just walked away.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.603
And then,
today at the lake.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.638
I went over there
to tell him to stay away.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.707
I told him I was gonna
to call the police.

05:06.740 --> 05:07.841
I'm in.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.377
Gabriel must have
slipped in

05:09.377 --> 05:11.612
while my back was turned.
I have no idea

05:11.645 --> 05:13.414
how long he was there
before I realized...

05:13.447 --> 05:14.948
And that man
jumped in after him?

05:14.982 --> 05:17.050
He said, "Call 911,"
and then he just jumped.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.819
Sam, call respiratory

05:18.852 --> 05:20.554
for a vent and set up
for bilateral chest tubes.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.390
Got it.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.791
And have Central bring
a circulating water blanket.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.058
He'll do better
with a Bair Hugger.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.093
They both work.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.495
Bair Hugger's better.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.729
Show me the data.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.431
You kids work it out.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.668
You guys all right in here?
Yeah, his core temp's up to 94,

05:34.702 --> 05:37.037
but his EKG shows
ischemic changes.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.140
Could've been caused by
the strain of the cold swim.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.809
Hey!
These flattened

05:41.842 --> 05:43.644
T waves,
I've had those for years.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.146
It's definitely not an MI.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.981
I'm a doctor,
retired six years.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.118
But I can still read an EKG.
Okay, well, let us

05:51.151 --> 05:53.120
check your troponins,
just in case.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.755
Knock yourself out.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.089
Where'd you practice?

05:56.123 --> 05:58.091
Stateville, 12 years.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.927
Stateville Penitentiary?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.929
Yes.
Bet that was intense.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.063
Well, you guys seem fine.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.097
I'm going back in with the kid.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.599
How is he?

06:05.633 --> 06:07.601
I can't talk about
his treatment.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.603
Of course.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.440
Hey, fun rounding with
you guys this morning.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.607
Hi, Archie.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.008
Want some advice?
No.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.810
You need to work on
your presentation style.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.579
Excuse me?
Yeah, you're too serious.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.847
Have a little fun.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.549
Take some joy in your work.
I'm fun.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.551
No, you're English.
I get it. I get it.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.853
It's hard to let your hair down,
but you are in America now.

06:25.886 --> 06:30.691
You know, I don't know
what you're basing this on...

06:30.724 --> 06:32.526
You know how hard it was
to find a jersey that small?

06:32.560 --> 06:35.128
Hockey?
See? I'm fun.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.130
We're going to finish rounds,
then head to the rink.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.132
Oh, Neela,
this is so hot.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.568
Can you do a triple axel?

06:40.601 --> 06:42.069
Dude, that's figure skating.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.137
Oh...
You're friends with that guy?

06:44.171 --> 06:46.474
Sort of.
Oh, tell the truth.
We slept together!

06:47.475 --> 06:48.842
She gave me a rash!

06:48.876 --> 06:50.978
(chuckles)

06:52.913 --> 06:54.615
Hey.
Oh, hey.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.049
Sorry about the
last few days.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.118
I've been working
11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.753
It's like I've fallen
off the planet, you know?

06:59.787 --> 07:01.221
No, it's okay.
I've been slammed, too.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.757
I'm leading a seminar
at the CAHC tomorrow

07:03.791 --> 07:04.992
and I'm way behind.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.694
What's CAHC?

07:06.727 --> 07:08.696
Complimentary Alternative
Health Conference.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.598
I told you all about it.
No, you didn't.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.000
Well, you may have been
in a postcoital stupor.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.002
But I am presenting data

07:15.035 --> 07:17.237
on the effects
of prayer on healing.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.173
They actually have data on that?
Yes.

07:20.207 --> 07:23.210
In fact, several studies have
shown that patients who have

07:23.243 --> 07:25.979
people praying for them get well
faster than those who don't.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.548
Ooh, spooky.

07:27.581 --> 07:28.782
Shut up.
The results are cool.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.150
Hey, listen,
when you get a minute,

07:30.183 --> 07:31.719
I got a guy for you
in Trauma.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.521
No, no, not
another consult.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.756
I-I have to get this talk
together or I'm screwed.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.190
Listen, he saved a kid
from drowning in a lake.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.826
The kid's not doing
so well right now,

07:38.859 --> 07:39.893
and he's a little
freaked out.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.529
Come on now.

07:41.562 --> 07:45.533
Okay, I have a baby-naming
ceremony in the NICU,

07:45.566 --> 07:48.736
and then I am meeting
with a statistician

07:48.769 --> 07:51.171
to go over the slides
for the talk.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.906
I'll come back after that.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.207
Thank you.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.943
Chest X-ray
on Robert Truman.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.679
Good.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.847
You're kidding me.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.014
Ugly, right?

08:01.048 --> 08:02.750
Yeesh! Who's that?

08:02.783 --> 08:03.951
Old lake guy.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.553
All right, order a chest CT

08:05.586 --> 08:07.020
and I'll get
an official read on that.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.889
Tell me you don't need
a radiologist

08:08.922 --> 08:10.591
to see this film
is abnormal.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.225
Diffuse lung
nodules; I know.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.928
Lung mets.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.730
The reason I called you down
was to get your take

08:16.764 --> 08:18.732
on the differential before I go
in there and tell the man

08:18.766 --> 08:20.568
he had metastatic cancer.

08:20.568 --> 08:23.136
Couldn't it be...
miliary TB

08:23.170 --> 08:25.939
or cocci or sarcoid
or something?

08:25.973 --> 08:28.241
Yeah, but in a
68-year-old guy,

08:28.275 --> 08:30.243
odds are it's
gonna be mets.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.011
Great.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.081
So, anything else?

08:35.816 --> 08:38.150
Um, I guess not.

08:38.184 --> 08:41.589
Thanks for the consult.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.327
Dr. Truman...

08:47.360 --> 08:49.296
Robert. Please.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.599
In your days as
a, uh, prison doc,

08:51.599 --> 08:54.802
did you ever get tested
positive for TB?

08:54.835 --> 08:59.172
No. I had a PPD
every four months.

08:59.206 --> 09:03.076
Any coughing, fevers,
night sweats?

09:03.110 --> 09:06.313
Huh... the chest X-ray.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.816
Metastatic prostate cancer.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.251
It spread to my lungs
and my bones

09:11.284 --> 09:13.621
before I even
knew I had it.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.323
I'm sorry.

09:16.356 --> 09:20.227
Well... I guess
it's my retribution.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.929
Excuse me?

09:21.962 --> 09:25.733
When men try to do God's work,

09:25.766 --> 09:27.701
bad things happen.

09:29.703 --> 09:33.941
I wish I realized this before
I killed that boy's father.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.845
Another run of v-tach.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.780
200 of bretylium
and start an infusion.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.148
Core temp's down to 71.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.750
He's getting colder?

09:42.783 --> 09:44.251
Sometimes the cold blood
in his extremities

09:44.284 --> 09:46.987
rushes up to his heart
and drops the core temp.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.322
Looks like your Bair Hugger
worked a little too well, huh?

09:49.356 --> 09:52.259
His heart can't beat normally
at this temperature.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.794
Sam, call the ECMO tech.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.963
Don't you think
that's jumping the gun?

09:55.996 --> 09:57.330
What about peritoneal lavage?

09:57.364 --> 09:58.966
What's, what's ECMO?

09:58.999 --> 10:00.634
Cardiac bypass.

10:00.668 --> 10:01.935
It's the only thing
that's going to warm the core

10:01.969 --> 10:02.970
fast enough.
Its too dangerous.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.404
It should be a last resort.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.339
His temperature's 71;
he's having runs of v-tach.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.941
I think we're there.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.342
Bleeding, infection...
He knows the risks.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.211
Thank you.
But I'm with
Sam on this.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.412
Gabriel's still
got a pulse

10:12.445 --> 10:14.047
and a decent BP.
Let's exhaust all

10:14.081 --> 10:15.315
other options before
jumping to ECMO.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.150
I'll go get the stuff.
We're going to put

10:17.184 --> 10:19.352
a tube in Gabriel's
belly and flush
in warm fluids

10:19.386 --> 10:20.654
to see if we can raise
his core temp...
Sam.

10:20.688 --> 10:21.789
Hey.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.356
Sam, what's
with you today?

10:23.390 --> 10:25.025
Nothing.
Then why
do you have

10:25.058 --> 10:26.760
to "Plan B" me
all the time?
"Plan B" you?!

10:26.794 --> 10:28.829
Seems like whatever I say,
you have a better idea.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.063
That's not true.
Uh, yes, Sam, it is true.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.732
Bair Hugger

10:31.765 --> 10:34.301
versus water blanket;
morphine versus fentanyl.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.136
Oh, okay, come on--
you sound crazy.
No. Whatever I want,

10:36.169 --> 10:37.971
you give me that look and then
you want something different.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.707
What look?
Look, that one right there.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.375
Tony, I don't blindly accept
orders from someone

10:42.409 --> 10:44.444
just because they come
from a doctor or a man.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.179
I've been doing this
a lot longer
than you have

10:46.213 --> 10:47.781
and I can think
for myself.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.917
If you don't like that,
that's too bad.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.058
Back at Stateville,

10:58.091 --> 11:00.393
my job was to give
lethal injections

11:00.427 --> 11:02.395
to death row inmates.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.997
Wow.

11:04.031 --> 11:07.067
That's heavy.
Yes.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.136
People could watch
through a window.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.072
And I remember,
I remember her,

11:12.105 --> 11:15.075
trying to be brave
for the baby

11:15.108 --> 11:18.478
as I injected the
thiopental...

11:18.511 --> 11:20.914
the pavulon...

11:20.948 --> 11:22.950
potassium.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.118
Gabriel was only two.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.755
He never knew his dad.

11:27.755 --> 11:30.090
Dr. Truman...

11:30.123 --> 11:32.092
you don't really have
to talk about this now

11:32.125 --> 11:34.094
if you don't want to.
No.

11:34.127 --> 11:37.097
Back then, I thought
it was the right thing.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.100
I thought there were criminals
who deserved to die

11:40.133 --> 11:44.171
and lethal injection
was the most humane way.

11:44.204 --> 11:48.175
As time went on,
my thinking's changed.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.210
About the death
penalty?

11:50.243 --> 11:53.080
Who lives and dies...

11:53.113 --> 11:56.083
should be decided by God,
not a jury.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.385
I've spent
the last five years

11:58.418 --> 12:01.388
tracking the loved ones
of the men I've killed.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.391
Tried to make amends
with those families.

12:04.424 --> 12:07.394
How do you make amends?

12:07.427 --> 12:10.130
Financial aid, mostly.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.132
It's all I have to offer.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.134
I paid a mortgage,
bought a...

12:14.167 --> 12:17.137
bought a car,
sent a child to college.

12:17.170 --> 12:21.141
Some people told me
to get lost.

12:21.174 --> 12:24.244
Others took
what I could offer.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.181
Well, that's really brave.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.050
And generous.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.152
No.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.487
They're all acts
of contrition.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.523
Small things.

12:36.556 --> 12:39.059
Nothing'll ever
bring back

12:39.092 --> 12:41.128
a husband, or son,

12:41.161 --> 12:44.097
father.

12:44.131 --> 12:47.134
Saving a kid's life
isn't a small thing.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.837
I'm just trying
to tell God

12:49.837 --> 12:51.839
how sorry I am
for what I've done.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.842
Please.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.978
I need that boy
to live.

13:03.016 --> 13:03.851
Tell that freak in there
to stop staring at me.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.986
Give him a break.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.554
Not many people would
jump in a frozen lake
for a stranger.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.190
He's not a stranger,
he's a stalker.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.524
V-tach,
lost the pulse.
All right,

13:11.558 --> 13:12.926
starting
compressions.
Oh, my God.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.194
What's happening?

13:14.227 --> 13:15.595
His heart has stopped
beating effectively

13:15.628 --> 13:17.097
because of the cold;
we can't shock it back

13:17.130 --> 13:19.399
into a natural rhythm
until he's warmer.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.868
This looks like
the right room.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.269
SKYE:
Who called for ECMO?

13:22.302 --> 13:23.436
I knew the conservative route
wouldn't work,

13:23.470 --> 13:25.138
so I give Teddy the heads up.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.539
SKYE:
Go ahead, let's
put him on.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.909
This is a cardiopulmonary
bypass machine.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.210
It will function
as Gabriel's heart

13:30.243 --> 13:31.478
and lungs
and warm his blood.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.479
Sam, you should've
listened to me.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.247
Let's hope it works.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.583
Celia, do you have any family
we need to call?

13:36.616 --> 13:38.185
Or Gabriel's dad?

13:38.218 --> 13:39.953
His dad's been dead
a couple years.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.021
How about your family?

13:41.054 --> 13:42.355
My father's out of the picture,

13:42.389 --> 13:43.323
I haven't talked to my mother
in years.

13:43.356 --> 13:44.557
Anspaugh's
on his way down

13:44.591 --> 13:46.093
to cannulate.
We can do it here.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.627
Surgery has to;
it's protocol.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.396
The chief of staff is coming
down for a central line?

13:49.429 --> 13:51.031
They're a little
short-staffed today.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.299
All up at a big conference
or something.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.301
(shouting)

13:54.334 --> 13:56.303
(cheering)

13:56.336 --> 13:58.538
Rasgotra,
isn't this fun?

13:58.571 --> 14:00.473
Uh, especially

14:00.507 --> 14:03.176
the part where I get to see
my attending in a jock strap.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.612
(chuckling):
Okay, go:

14:05.645 --> 14:07.614
I'm streaking the blue line
in the dump and chase,

14:07.647 --> 14:09.282
what do you do?

14:09.316 --> 14:11.651
Dump in the far corner
and head to the net.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.520
Exactly right.
Okay, everybody,

14:13.553 --> 14:15.222
listen up!

14:15.255 --> 14:16.256
Smart!

14:16.289 --> 14:17.424
Aggressive!

14:17.457 --> 14:19.059
No mercy!

14:19.092 --> 14:20.527
MEN (chanting):
Smart! Aggressive! No mercy!

14:20.560 --> 14:22.996
Smart! Aggressive! No mercy!
Smart...

14:23.030 --> 14:25.632
The machine is doing
the work for his heart

14:25.665 --> 14:28.268
and lungs, so we're
going to take out
the breathing tube.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.270
I see.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.605
When his temp's up,
his own heart will
kick back in.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.607
Well, that's the hope.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.010
What, what do you mean
"that's the the hope"?

14:37.044 --> 14:41.014
Well, I'm sure Dr. Gates
has explained that...

14:41.048 --> 14:43.016
Gabriel's tissues may
be permanently damaged

14:43.050 --> 14:45.252
because of the cold.
Yeah, I explained
that to her,

14:45.285 --> 14:47.154
but we're trying
to think positive
here, right?
Okay.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.156
Right.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.523
Look,

14:50.557 --> 14:51.658
we all hope
that this brings him back.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.193
But he's down for a long time.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.129
Has had over an
hour of CPR.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.198
Celia, call someone.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.533
A friend, family,
it doesn't matter.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.701
You just need
some support.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.437
You don't know what I need.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.340
I'm a single mom.

15:07.374 --> 15:11.044
I know asking for help
feels like cheating sometimes.

15:16.049 --> 15:19.686
Jimmy, Gabriel's dad...

15:19.719 --> 15:21.088
he was one
of those guys

15:21.121 --> 15:23.123
who couldn't stay
out of trouble.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.158
Running drugs...

15:25.192 --> 15:27.327
stealing cars...

15:27.360 --> 15:31.498
I was an idiot;
I thought he'd change.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.000
That's human.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.203
And I told my mom

15:36.236 --> 15:38.338
Jimmy and I were going
to raise the baby together,

15:38.371 --> 15:42.075
and she kicked me out
of the house.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.011
She said,

15:44.011 --> 15:47.147
"You may be lost but I am not
going to have a guy like that

15:47.180 --> 15:50.183
around the rest of my kids."

15:50.217 --> 15:52.652
Looking back,
she was probably right.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.722
Celia, there's

15:55.755 --> 15:57.624
a very good chance

15:57.657 --> 15:59.459
that Gabriel's heart
won't start up again.

15:59.492 --> 16:03.063
No, please,
please don't say that.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.098
This is gonna work!

16:05.132 --> 16:07.234
(sobbing)

16:09.136 --> 16:11.771
Guys, I need another liter
of NS and an ABG kit.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.740
Okay. Yeah, I got it.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.742
GATES:
And, uh, check an
ionized calcium

16:15.775 --> 16:17.744
while you're at it-- the
last one was low, okay?

16:17.777 --> 16:19.079
555...

16:19.112 --> 16:20.780
0172.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.782
That's my mom.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.784
Could you call her?

16:24.817 --> 16:27.520
Right away.

16:36.796 --> 16:39.299
Yeah!

16:39.332 --> 16:41.768
Game on!

16:41.801 --> 16:43.070
Who are we playing?

16:43.070 --> 16:44.237
Pedes, I think.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.106
I saw the pathologists
practicing

16:46.139 --> 16:47.507
in the parking lot.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.342
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):
And now...

16:49.376 --> 16:50.777
the starting lineup

16:50.810 --> 16:53.580
of County General's very own...

16:53.613 --> 16:56.749
unstoppable, irrepressible...

16:56.783 --> 16:59.786
the Mighty Docs!

16:59.819 --> 17:04.124
Playing right wing,
Lucien Dubenko!

17:04.156 --> 17:05.724
They are such
drama queens.

17:05.758 --> 17:06.792
We're playing

17:06.826 --> 17:09.829
the Trauma surgeons?!

17:09.862 --> 17:11.431
We beat them in the
last five seconds

17:11.464 --> 17:12.432
of the finals last
year-- right, boys?

17:12.464 --> 17:16.103
Left wing, Dusty Crenshaw!

17:16.136 --> 17:18.704
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

17:19.872 --> 17:24.377
On defense, Harold Zelinsky!

17:30.850 --> 17:34.787
And playing center...

17:34.821 --> 17:36.823
Archie Morris!

17:36.856 --> 17:39.326
Oh, no way!

17:39.359 --> 17:41.128
Way!
Oh, this explains
everything.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.862
Your weird behavior, the
Trauma exchange program...

17:42.895 --> 17:45.632
An elaborate ruse to play
on this team and kick your ass.

17:45.665 --> 17:46.833
He's a ringer!

17:46.866 --> 17:49.269
Yeah, baby. Huh?

17:50.737 --> 17:53.706
I had a 26-year-old kid
on the table,

17:53.740 --> 17:55.875
convicted of killing a cop.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.878
See his family pleading,
praying.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.881
I injected the drugs

18:01.914 --> 18:05.218
and he didn't die.

18:05.252 --> 18:09.222
He lay there, awake, quivering.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.558
Lethal doses
of three different agents

18:11.591 --> 18:13.593
and he was alive.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.762
Parents were crying,
claiming a miracle.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.765
What happened?

18:18.798 --> 18:21.768
The I.V. infiltrated.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.604
The drugs pooled
in his soft tissues,

18:24.637 --> 18:27.607
instead of going
into his bloodstream.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.610
So I placed another I.V.,

18:30.643 --> 18:33.746
drew up another round
of meds and pushed.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.884
And this time...

18:37.917 --> 18:40.887
it took him
90 seconds to die.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.823
(sighs)

18:43.856 --> 18:47.194
Seven months later,
a police officer came forward.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.364
The boy was framed
for the murder.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.200
Hmm?

18:53.933 --> 18:56.303
He didn't do it.

18:58.405 --> 18:59.839
You couldn't have
known that.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.842
God tried to stop me

19:02.875 --> 19:05.845
from killing an innocent man
and I ignored the sign.

19:05.878 --> 19:09.282
How can I even hope
for forgiveness?

19:09.316 --> 19:11.784
I think...

19:11.818 --> 19:14.454
sometimes it's easier

19:14.487 --> 19:17.590
to feel guilty
than forgiven.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.563
Which means what?

19:23.596 --> 19:28.235
That maybe your guilt
over these deaths

19:28.268 --> 19:30.270
has become your
reason for living.

19:30.303 --> 19:33.273
Maybe you need a new
reason to go on.

19:33.306 --> 19:36.309
I-I-I... I don't
want to go on.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.345
Can't you see I'm old,

19:38.378 --> 19:42.349
I have cancer--
I've had enough.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.685
The only thing that is holding
me back is that I am afraid.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.354
I'm afraid of what comes next.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.856
And what do you
think that is?

19:49.889 --> 19:51.858
Oh, you tell me.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.493
Is atonement even possible?

19:53.526 --> 19:54.827
What does God want from me?

19:54.861 --> 19:57.630
I think it's up to
each one of us

19:57.664 --> 19:59.666
to interpret what God wants.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.001
So people can do anything?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.970
They can rape,
they can murder,

20:04.003 --> 20:05.705
they can steal,
all in the name of God

20:05.738 --> 20:07.874
and it's okay?
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.442
Well, what are you saying?

20:09.476 --> 20:12.245
Because all I'm hearing is
some New Age,

20:12.279 --> 20:15.448
God-is-love,
one-size-fits-all crap!

20:15.482 --> 20:17.350
Hey, Dr. Truman...

20:17.384 --> 20:19.819
(coughing):
No, I don't have time
for this now!

20:19.852 --> 20:21.488
Greg, it's okay.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.989
Look, I understand...

20:23.022 --> 20:24.591
No, you don't understand!

20:24.624 --> 20:26.593
You don't understand!

20:26.626 --> 20:27.894
How could you possibly
say that?

20:27.927 --> 20:29.862
No, you listen to me.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.898
I want a real chaplain

20:31.931 --> 20:34.367
who believes in a real God
and a real hell.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.403
I hear that
you're frustrated

20:36.436 --> 20:37.637
but you need to
ask yourself...

20:37.670 --> 20:40.407
No, I don't need to ask myself!

20:40.440 --> 20:42.509
I need answers.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.377
And all your questions

20:44.411 --> 20:49.582
and your uncertainty are
only making things worse.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.918
I... I know you're upset...

20:51.951 --> 20:53.653
Oh, God...

20:53.686 --> 20:56.789
I need someone who will look me
in the eye and tell me

20:56.823 --> 20:58.458
how to find forgiveness,

20:58.491 --> 21:01.394
because I am running
out of time!

21:03.330 --> 21:05.632
I'm trying to help.
Well, don't!

21:05.665 --> 21:06.833
Just get out!

21:06.866 --> 21:09.001
Get out!

21:09.035 --> 21:11.338
Get out!

21:12.839 --> 21:14.441
Hey, Julia.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.775
Julia, come on.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.544
Listen, come on.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.646
Come on. The guy's just
freaking out. He didn't mean

21:19.679 --> 21:20.947
what he said.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.649
Yeah, he did.

21:22.682 --> 21:25.352
He absolutely did.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.358
MORRIS:
Okay, don't
choke, Neela.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.092
Don't cough it up.
It'd be real embarrassing

21:33.125 --> 21:34.927
if you lost
that puck to me.

21:34.961 --> 21:38.064
Neela!
Yes! Stay down!

21:40.132 --> 21:43.970
Yes!
(whistle blows)

21:45.438 --> 21:46.639
ALL THREE:
Get up!

21:48.875 --> 21:50.577
Oh, let's see.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.545
Your eye-- crap.

21:52.579 --> 21:53.913
Concentration-- crap.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.548
Coordination--
crap.
(taps stick)

21:55.582 --> 21:56.849
How do we let
this girl operate?

22:04.624 --> 22:07.660
(whooping, cheering)

22:11.664 --> 22:13.766
Hit me.
Come on, hit me.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.134
You know
you want to.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.503
I don't.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.438
Come on, hit me!
Lucien!

22:18.471 --> 22:20.573
Everybody wants to take a shot
at their mentor, don't they?

22:26.813 --> 22:28.581
(Rasgotra grunts)

22:28.615 --> 22:30.149
(whistle blows)

22:30.182 --> 22:32.118
Ha!

22:32.151 --> 22:34.120
Come on, Neela.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.522
Untie the piano.

22:35.555 --> 22:36.589
You'll skate faster, huh?

22:36.623 --> 22:38.057
Hup-ah! Oh, no!

22:38.090 --> 22:39.592
Wha...?

22:39.626 --> 22:41.461
(players yelling)

22:43.596 --> 22:44.597
Oh, yeah!

22:44.631 --> 22:45.598
(hooting)

22:45.632 --> 22:46.699
Yeah!

22:48.635 --> 22:50.637
I got... I got it.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.605
I got it.

22:52.639 --> 22:53.706
(grunting)

22:56.943 --> 22:59.512
Ooh! Ooh!

22:59.546 --> 23:00.480
(Morris grunts)

23:00.513 --> 23:02.815
Neela, you're dead!

23:03.750 --> 23:05.618
(whooping)

23:05.652 --> 23:07.620
(cheering)

23:07.654 --> 23:09.121
Hey, Gates, hold on.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.690
You've seen
Julia around?

23:10.723 --> 23:12.058
No, not since this morning.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.726
She's not answering
her pager.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.528
She usually turns it off
when she's with patients.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.829
(sighs)

23:16.863 --> 23:21.468
This guy in One...
it's... it's a mess.

23:21.468 --> 23:23.636
Do you have any
questions for us,
Mrs. Davies?

23:23.670 --> 23:25.104
No. Celia explained
it all.

23:25.137 --> 23:28.575
She always had a
head for science.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.643
Gabriel does, too.

23:30.677 --> 23:33.179
He wants
to be a marine biologist.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.181
TEDDY:
ACT is 224.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.016
All right, let's keep
the heparin where it's at.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.686
You sure you want
to do that? I would try...

23:45.692 --> 23:47.760
What are you doing here?

23:47.794 --> 23:49.662
I wanted
to let you know...

23:49.696 --> 23:50.830
You can't be here.

23:50.863 --> 23:51.998
Please. I want
to say that I'm...

23:52.031 --> 23:54.667
Get out! Please, just go.

23:54.701 --> 23:55.635
Sir, maybe you should
just go back to bed.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.504
Hold on, Sam,
hold on.

23:57.537 --> 24:01.040
Look, ma'am, he tried
to save your son's life.

24:01.073 --> 24:05.512
Just give him a chance
to say what he came to say.

24:05.545 --> 24:06.979
And afterwards,

24:07.013 --> 24:09.749
you'll give this family
their privacy, right?

24:09.782 --> 24:12.619
Yes.

24:14.721 --> 24:17.023
Sorry.

24:17.056 --> 24:22.128
I'm sorry for all
the trouble I've caused.

24:25.865 --> 24:29.168
I-I'm praying
for your boy.

24:29.201 --> 24:32.038
Sir, thank you
for your bravery.

24:32.071 --> 24:34.907
I'm very grateful.
So is my daughter.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.546
Right, Celia?

24:40.913 --> 24:43.550
Celia, tell him.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.954
Tell this man
thank you.

24:50.590 --> 24:53.760
Thank you.

24:53.793 --> 24:56.028
FLORA:
Like you mean it.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.733
I am not
three years old anymore.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.702
I-I have to call work.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.208
That's... That's all.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.279
Come on, let me get you
back on the monitor.

25:14.814 --> 25:15.982
Lucien, five hole
or top shelf?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.650
I don't care.
Just make it count.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.620
Oh!

25:20.653 --> 25:22.254
(whistle blows)

25:22.288 --> 25:23.823
Ow!

25:23.856 --> 25:25.191
We need a goalie here!

25:25.224 --> 25:28.194
(wailing)

25:31.230 --> 25:33.065
Hey, you guys ever seen
Neela drunk?

25:33.099 --> 25:35.935
Yeah, you should
have seen her at the
E.R. Christmas party.

25:35.968 --> 25:38.605
She gave Anspaugh
a lap dance!
Ow!

25:40.740 --> 25:44.010
Could've blocked that with
a wad of toilet paper, Morris.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.613
I hear she still
sleeps with a blankie.

25:46.613 --> 25:47.847
She calls it
her nubbie.

25:47.880 --> 25:48.981
What the hell

25:49.015 --> 25:50.282
are you talking about?

25:52.685 --> 25:53.853
(whooping, cheering)

25:53.886 --> 25:55.688
Nice!
That's right.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.690
(players hooting,
whooping)

25:57.724 --> 25:59.892
Hey, your career as a
goalie doesn't pan out,

25:59.926 --> 26:03.329
you can always go back to
working at the Jumbo Mart.

26:03.362 --> 26:06.332
You guys know she used to
work at Jumbo Mart, right?

26:06.365 --> 26:07.867
(Morris and others
laughing)

26:07.900 --> 26:10.637
(whooping)

26:19.311 --> 26:21.247
Ow!

26:22.749 --> 26:24.283
PRATT:
Hey, Skye...

26:24.316 --> 26:26.285
have you seen Julia around?

26:26.318 --> 26:28.154
No.

26:28.187 --> 26:30.890
She had trouble with one of
my patients and went AWOL.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.024
What happened?

26:32.058 --> 26:33.826
Are you ready for this one?

26:33.860 --> 26:38.030
My guy in One gave a lethal
injection to the father

26:38.064 --> 26:40.232
of your boy in Two.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.201
What?
He was a prison doctor.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.937
He used to push the drugs
into the guys on death row.

26:44.971 --> 26:47.139
Now, I guess, he's
had a change of heart.

26:47.173 --> 26:48.908
Excuse me one second.
Hey, Chaz.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.010
Hey!
Hey, man.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.748
Hey, Celia.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.951
Everything all right?

26:58.985 --> 27:00.953
Yeah.

27:00.987 --> 27:04.223
Yeah, it's just work, you know?

27:11.263 --> 27:13.933
I guess she wants a commitment,
but I don't know.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.935
Maybe I'm not
that kind of guy.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.004
So why don't you
just tell her that?

27:18.037 --> 27:19.706
Betina's great, man.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.808
It's not like I'm looking
for something better.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.910
You guys been together
for a while now.

27:23.943 --> 27:25.377
Yeah, nine months.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.046
Hmm! Must be a
record for you.
(laughs)

27:27.079 --> 27:29.782
I like her, all right,
so that's not the issue.

27:29.816 --> 27:32.952
Well, why don't you
just give it a try
and see what happens?

27:32.985 --> 27:35.254
You know, it's easy
for you to say.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.089
You're 20 years old,
still playing the field.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.991
(laughs)

27:39.025 --> 27:41.327
Uh, Greg, I've been with the
same guy for almost a year now.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.795
Really?
Yeah.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.797
Why didn't you
tell me that before?

27:44.831 --> 27:46.899
You never asked.

27:46.933 --> 27:48.735
All right, well,
I should take these.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.136
All right, cool.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.370
Thanks for
the coffee.
Oh, anytime.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.873
Hey, what's
his name?
Andrew.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.341
All right, well,
I'd like to meet him sometime.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.744
We can all go to a
drag club or something.

27:57.777 --> 27:58.978
(screams):
Ha!

27:59.011 --> 28:00.179
Just kidding, man.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.248
That'd be cool.
What you got?

28:02.281 --> 28:05.151
Mass cas at the ice rink:
"Ortho versus Trauma."
What?

28:05.184 --> 28:07.019
CRENSHAW:
You!
Yeah.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.988
You were a complete goon
out there!
Yeah.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.957
I hit you on the numbers, 'cause
you elbowed me in the head!

28:10.990 --> 28:12.024
Headhunter!

28:12.058 --> 28:13.192
Octopus!
Slasher!

28:13.225 --> 28:16.763
(all yelling at once)

28:16.763 --> 28:17.997
I saved your ass
so many times!

28:18.030 --> 28:19.365
Saved my ass?
What are you, high?

28:19.398 --> 28:21.167
What's wrong
with you guys?
Stay out of it!

28:21.200 --> 28:22.869
RASGOTRA:
Shut up, Harold!
You just stuck your finger...

28:22.902 --> 28:24.070
Maybe I wouldn't have to if
you weren't such a goon!

28:24.103 --> 28:25.271
Maybe you should practice
a little more!

28:25.304 --> 28:26.405
Well, I'm sure
you've had plenty

28:26.438 --> 28:27.774
of practice
swinging your stick!

28:27.807 --> 28:29.776
Huh? Huh?
Oh, could you lay down?

28:29.776 --> 28:32.111
I don't recognize you
standing up!

28:33.045 --> 28:34.113
No!

28:37.183 --> 28:38.851
(clamoring)

28:38.885 --> 28:40.019
Get off of him, you...!

28:40.052 --> 28:41.988
(shouting)

28:42.021 --> 28:43.522
ECMO tech needs you
in T-2 right away.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.157
That kid's awake.
RASGOTRA:
...a piece of you!

28:45.191 --> 28:47.359
Oh, shut up, Harold!

28:47.393 --> 28:49.095
Cripes!

28:49.929 --> 28:51.530
What's going on?

28:51.563 --> 28:53.232
Sometimes we see this after
a few hours on the machine.

28:53.265 --> 28:56.302
They just wake up.

28:56.335 --> 28:59.238
SAM:
Sat's okay on room air.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.941
Mommy, what happened?

29:01.974 --> 29:03.442
Oh, baby.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.444
Hi, baby. Hi.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.013
You're okay.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.481
That a boy, Gabriel.
FLORA:
Oh, thank God.

29:09.515 --> 29:12.451
Oh, he's okay.
He's gonna be okay.
I know, baby.

29:12.484 --> 29:13.485
TEDDY:
Core temp's up

29:13.519 --> 29:14.987
to 94.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.222
FLORA:
This family
will never forget

29:16.255 --> 29:17.857
what you did here today.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.225
Just doing our job.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.027
Well, I don't care
what you say.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.328
It's a miracle.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.863
GATES:
Sam, Teddy, what do you say

29:23.896 --> 29:25.497
we take this kid
off the machine?

29:25.531 --> 29:26.866
TEDDY:
Sounds good.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.167
TAGGART:
Size eight gloves okay?

29:28.200 --> 29:30.169
Looks like good
news in there.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.973
This doesn't
absolve you.

29:34.006 --> 29:38.010
Don't think it does.

29:38.044 --> 29:41.013
I don't forgive you.

29:41.047 --> 29:44.183
I will never forgive you.

29:46.552 --> 29:49.155
You have to live
with what you've done.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.931
(shuddering)

30:01.133 --> 30:03.569
Oh, man.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.038
(sighs)

30:12.278 --> 30:14.881
Julia.

30:16.282 --> 30:18.150
Well, the lake kid
is doing great.

30:20.186 --> 30:24.924
But our guy... he
needs you in there.

30:26.092 --> 30:29.095
I can't.

30:29.128 --> 30:30.863
All right, well, I
need you in there.

30:30.897 --> 30:32.164
(sniffles)

30:32.198 --> 30:33.532
He's asking me all
kind of questions

30:33.565 --> 30:36.368
that I don't know
how to answer.

30:38.404 --> 30:42.474
You know, doubt--

30:42.508 --> 30:45.077
it's... uncomfortable.

30:45.111 --> 30:48.514
But certainty--

30:48.547 --> 30:51.951
I don't think it's real.

30:51.984 --> 30:56.088
I mean, I-I...
I went to seminary.

30:56.122 --> 31:00.159
I studied Buddhism,
I spent time in an ashram,

31:00.192 --> 31:02.228
(groans)

31:03.662 --> 31:07.099
Who really knows anything
with absolute certainty?

31:07.133 --> 31:11.137
Not me, that's for sure.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.172
That's why I thought
an inclusive approach

31:13.205 --> 31:16.008
to spirituality would
work well in a place like this.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.944
It does. It does.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.479
The patients-- they
appreciate what you do.

31:20.512 --> 31:24.516
People in crisis want rules,
they want structure,

31:24.550 --> 31:26.118
something to lean on.

31:26.152 --> 31:28.220
I get that.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.156
But it's not me.

31:31.723 --> 31:36.996
You know, we all wonder what
we're doing here sometimes.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.231
That guy needs help.

31:40.166 --> 31:42.368
So, come on,

31:42.401 --> 31:44.303
(sniffles)
come back in
there with me.

31:44.336 --> 31:46.305
Let's go talk to him.

31:49.141 --> 31:51.643
I don't think so.
(sniffles)

31:51.677 --> 31:54.280
(sighs heavily)

31:57.583 --> 32:00.052
All right.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.457
Ramsey, what, did you trip over
the blue line?

32:05.491 --> 32:07.359
Yeah, fell on me.

32:07.393 --> 32:10.029
Morris, what, did you hurt
yourself doing a triple axel?

32:10.062 --> 32:11.163
So, who won?

32:11.197 --> 32:12.564
It was a mutual forfeit.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.300
Didn't know you had
it in you, Mayday.

32:14.333 --> 32:15.567
Me either.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.136
X-ray's negative--
home with splint.

32:17.169 --> 32:18.470
All right,
who's next?

32:18.504 --> 32:21.307
MORRIS:
Hey, Neela, how's your boo-boo?

32:21.340 --> 32:23.675
CRENSHAW (British accent):
Oh, it's my dominant hand.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.277
If I can't operate, you're dead.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.579
Wuss.
You hack!
Bee-yotch!

32:27.613 --> 32:29.481
Who are you yelling at, Harold?

32:29.515 --> 32:31.250
I don't really know.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.085
No tenderness, bearing weight.

32:33.119 --> 32:34.753
Hey, how's my team?

32:34.786 --> 32:36.522
I think they all
need ibuprofen,

32:36.555 --> 32:38.190
a hot tub and a
glass of wine.

32:38.224 --> 32:39.458
I like the way you think.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.227
Okay, listen up,
everyone, fun's over.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.262
Orthopods are rounding
on the hall in ten.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.763
Trauma to the ICU.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.632
MORRIS:
Whoa, whoa, what about me?

32:46.665 --> 32:48.567
There's an ingrown toenail in
Exam Three with your name on it.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.102
Sam!

32:50.136 --> 32:51.203
What's up, buddy?

32:51.237 --> 32:52.604
You sick of us down here?

32:52.638 --> 32:54.273
No, I-I like it.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.674
You like it? You're a weird kid,
you know that?

32:55.707 --> 32:58.210
He likes the Jell-O.

32:58.244 --> 32:59.411
Thanks again, Doctor.

32:59.445 --> 33:00.546
You're welcome.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.114
You take care of your mom, okay?

33:02.148 --> 33:03.515
Sam, any beds open up?

33:03.549 --> 33:06.052
Well, I had to threaten
the charge nurse

33:06.085 --> 33:08.254
with physical violence,
but something opened up.

33:08.287 --> 33:10.056
Right. Hey, we're
going to Ike Ryan's.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.223
You should come.

33:11.257 --> 33:12.391
Should I?
Yeah.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.126
As long as
if I order you a beer

33:14.160 --> 33:15.394
you don't change it
to a vodka gimlet or something.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.263
Well, I don't know.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.131
I have to report upstairs,
then I've got to do

33:19.165 --> 33:20.466
a bunch of
stuff down here.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.068
How often do we get
an outcome like this?

33:22.101 --> 33:23.469
A pulseless ice cube
turned into

33:23.502 --> 33:26.238
a Jell-O loving 11-year-old
in the same shift.

33:26.272 --> 33:27.473
That doesn't
happen every day.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.641
That's for sure.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.177
Well?

33:31.210 --> 33:32.278
Well...

33:32.311 --> 33:34.546
I'll see if I can make it.

34:27.433 --> 34:30.402
I have sinned against Heaven...

34:32.338 --> 34:35.674
...and in your sight

34:35.706 --> 34:39.745
are no more worthy.

34:39.777 --> 34:43.315
Gracious God...

34:45.184 --> 34:48.154
...my mortal sins...

34:48.154 --> 34:50.422
I accept.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.527
Stop!

34:55.561 --> 34:57.263
What the hell
are you doing?

34:57.296 --> 35:00.466
I am in hell...
do you understand?

35:00.499 --> 35:03.335
I am in hell already,
I might as well go.

35:03.369 --> 35:04.570
Listen to me.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.605
You saved a little boy's life.

35:06.638 --> 35:07.706
No, it is not enough.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.575
I can't change my destiny.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.310
There isn't time.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.345
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe your destiny

35:13.379 --> 35:15.514
was for you to be on
that pier this morning?

35:15.547 --> 35:17.483
That maybe
your life's path,

35:17.516 --> 35:19.851
and all the choices
that you made,

35:19.885 --> 35:22.921
led you right there, so
you could save that kid?
Why? Why?

35:22.954 --> 35:24.823
Why would God do that?

35:24.856 --> 35:29.228
Why would he have me kill
17 people to save one?

35:29.261 --> 35:30.729
You may not understand it,

35:30.762 --> 35:33.399
but that little boy is alive
because you were there.

35:33.432 --> 35:38.470
Now, whatever you need that
to count for-- it counts.

35:43.409 --> 35:45.577
(crying)

35:45.611 --> 35:48.814
It doesn't make sense.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.619
It doesn't have
to make sense.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.887
(crying)

35:55.921 --> 35:58.790
That's why it's called faith.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.792
(crying)

36:00.826 --> 36:03.495
(sighs)

36:04.430 --> 36:06.498
(sobbing)

36:18.710 --> 36:20.679
(sighs)

36:20.712 --> 36:22.881
(moaning)

36:24.383 --> 36:25.484
TAGGART:
Hey, guys.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.319
Hey, Sam,
great job today.

36:27.353 --> 36:28.887
Thank you.
You, too.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.622
Hey, Gabriel all tucked in?

36:30.656 --> 36:33.359
Yes. The ICU nurses are
fawning all over him.

36:33.392 --> 36:34.460
All right.
Okay.

36:34.493 --> 36:35.494
My turn to win
some money.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.862
All right.
All right.

36:36.895 --> 36:38.564
So, what are you drinking?

36:38.597 --> 36:41.267
Actually, I can't stay.
I got...

36:41.300 --> 36:44.002
Oh, so you came here to tell me
that you can't come here?

36:44.035 --> 36:45.637
Yeah.

36:45.671 --> 36:47.706
Really? Have you heard
of the cell phone?

36:47.739 --> 36:49.775
All right, you know what?

36:49.808 --> 36:51.510
You're right, it was dumb.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.279
I shouldn't have come here.
I wasn't thinking.

36:53.279 --> 36:54.913
Wow, she admits
that she wasn't thinking.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.448
Alert the media.

36:56.482 --> 36:58.350
Screw you, Gates.

36:58.384 --> 36:59.785
Come on, just stay here.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.453
She'll have... will you
get her a beer, please?

37:01.487 --> 37:02.621
BARTENDER:
Sure.

37:02.654 --> 37:06.558
Vodka gimlet, with a twist.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.797
Definitely the most
insane shift

37:11.830 --> 37:13.932
I've worked
since I started here.

37:13.965 --> 37:16.535
Ah, you said the exact
same thing yesterday.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.570
(laughs):
I did not.

37:18.604 --> 37:20.506
(groans)

37:20.539 --> 37:22.874
So... (sighs)

37:22.908 --> 37:24.443
you going to Ike's
after this?

37:24.476 --> 37:27.313
No. I'm not much
of a group person.

37:27.313 --> 37:31.350
I need my alone time
at the end of the day.

37:31.383 --> 37:33.585
Is that why you're
not married?

37:35.887 --> 37:37.022
No.

37:37.055 --> 37:39.825
Then why isn't a hot,

37:39.858 --> 37:42.494
smart woman such
as yourself

37:42.528 --> 37:45.030
shacked up by now?

37:45.063 --> 37:47.566
And I'm not
hitting on you.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.067
Just wondering

37:49.100 --> 37:51.637
if some people aren't cut out
for commitment.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.574
Nobody is cut out
for commitment.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.009
It fights our DNA.

37:58.043 --> 38:00.879
You don't believe in monogamy?

38:00.912 --> 38:03.014
No, I believe in monogamy.

38:03.048 --> 38:07.786
I just don't believe in
the concept of... forever.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.788
People force the issue

38:09.821 --> 38:11.957
and then act surprised
when it doesn't work out.

38:13.892 --> 38:17.363
Well, you know, some people
might say that your theory

38:17.396 --> 38:19.931
is a cover for
a fear of commitment.

38:22.568 --> 38:26.405
Well, it takes
a lot of courage to reject

38:26.438 --> 38:29.541
the widely embraced
social construct of marriage.

38:29.575 --> 38:32.644
Most people assume you've
got some kind of problem.

38:37.716 --> 38:41.553
Well, seems like
you've got it all figured out.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.390
Some days.

38:44.390 --> 38:46.492
(groans)

38:49.661 --> 38:51.630
G'night, Skye.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.566
Good night.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.568
(moans)

38:56.602 --> 38:58.570
How did you hurt
your shoulder?

38:58.604 --> 39:00.939
Checked by Grossman
after the face-off.

39:00.972 --> 39:05.577
But I hurt him worse later.

39:05.611 --> 39:08.414
Ever seen bonobos
at the zoo?

39:08.414 --> 39:10.582
What's a bonobo?

39:10.616 --> 39:13.585
Pygmy chimp.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.621
Famous in the primate world

39:15.654 --> 39:19.625
for their social-
sexual behavior.

39:19.658 --> 39:22.428
Well, fascinating.

39:28.634 --> 39:30.602
In bonobo communities,

39:30.636 --> 39:33.672
sex is a way to say hello.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.974
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.676
Hello.

39:38.644 --> 39:40.646
This is so awesome.

39:40.679 --> 39:41.980
RASGOTRA:
I didn't know these were here.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.582
GROSSMAN:
Hot tubs are for therapy

39:43.615 --> 39:45.150
during the day,
but at night,

39:45.183 --> 39:48.153
they belong
to the hockey team.

39:48.186 --> 39:50.856
Lucien, Skye,
how's the water?

39:51.790 --> 39:54.626
Hot. Very hot.

39:54.660 --> 39:57.128
(sighs)

40:01.667 --> 40:03.201
Guys?

40:03.234 --> 40:05.036
This job rocks.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.809
I'm not sure what the point
of that would be

40:10.842 --> 40:12.544
other than to make him
feel guilty

40:12.578 --> 40:13.879
(knocking on door)
on top of everything else.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.648
Uh... I gotta go.

40:16.682 --> 40:17.949
Okay. Bye.

40:17.983 --> 40:19.951
Hey.

40:19.985 --> 40:21.920
Hey.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.623
What's up?

40:24.656 --> 40:27.092
We need to talk.

40:29.695 --> 40:31.930
I'm sorry about
this morning. Okay?

40:31.963 --> 40:34.766
You had the right
to be mad.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.902
Apology accepted.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.741
Look...

40:42.774 --> 40:45.877
this is all new
to me, okay?

40:45.911 --> 40:48.814
I haven't been down
this path before.

40:48.847 --> 40:51.717
But I really...

40:51.750 --> 40:54.085
really want this to work.

40:56.021 --> 41:00.726
Do you know if you stare at an
X-ray for more than 38 seconds

41:00.759 --> 41:03.795
you start to see things
that aren't there?

41:03.829 --> 41:06.031
Because that's what
this is, Greg.

41:06.064 --> 41:07.198
We've stared
at this thing

41:07.232 --> 41:08.967
too long and tricked ourselves

41:09.000 --> 41:10.802
into seeing something
that isn't there.

41:10.836 --> 41:13.539
You're not listening, okay?

41:13.539 --> 41:14.806
I want to do this.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.708
This morning you seemed
totally unsure.

41:16.742 --> 41:19.545
Who's sure about anything?

41:19.578 --> 41:21.613
This shouldn't have
to be this hard.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.549
Eventually, you know,

41:23.549 --> 41:26.552
we would end up right back
in the same place,

41:26.552 --> 41:28.887
and frankly,

41:28.920 --> 41:31.256
I don't have the time.

41:43.569 --> 41:45.270
Thank you
for waiting with me.

41:45.303 --> 41:47.105
No problem.

41:47.138 --> 41:49.575
Oh!

41:49.608 --> 41:51.943
ECMO was a good call
with that kid.

41:51.977 --> 41:54.880
We probably should've
done it sooner.

41:54.913 --> 41:57.082
It's annoying,
but you were right.

41:57.115 --> 41:58.784
Thank you.

41:58.817 --> 41:59.985
And, Sam...

42:00.018 --> 42:01.787
I do like
working with you.

42:01.820 --> 42:03.855
Other than the relentless
interrogation

42:03.889 --> 42:06.758
and second-guessing and...

42:06.792 --> 42:07.993
you constantly
blowing me off
Shut up.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.294
when I gave you orders...

42:17.803 --> 42:20.038
I hate you.

42:20.972 --> 42:23.241
I hate you, too.
