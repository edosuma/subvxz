01:30.520 --> 01:32.596
Remember...

01:33.496 --> 01:35.460
I love you.

01:36.760 --> 01:39.684
I love you, Thomas.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.408
Mom!

01:50.680 --> 01:52.523
Mom!

02:07.560 --> 02:09.085
Thomas...

02:09.880 --> 02:11.928
it's okay.

02:28.760 --> 02:31.240
No, no, no!

02:33.200 --> 02:34.611
Thomas!

02:35.120 --> 02:36.121
Thomas!

02:38.720 --> 02:40.131
Thomas!

02:40.280 --> 02:42.886
Wake up! We gotta go! Come on!

02:44.720 --> 02:46.927
Let's go! Let's go! We gotta go!

02:47.080 --> 02:49.082
You all right? You all right?

02:49.240 --> 02:50.241
Wait, wait, wait!

02:50.440 --> 02:53.929
Where are you going? We don't have time!

02:55.080 --> 02:56.127
Come on!

02:56.600 --> 02:57.601
Get out of here!

02:59.040 --> 03:00.769
Cranks! We got Cranks!

03:00.920 --> 03:02.763
Gotta move! Not safe out here, kid!

03:02.920 --> 03:04.160
Got a swarm to the flank!

03:04.320 --> 03:05.606
Go, kid! Go, go!

03:06.160 --> 03:09.482
Set a perimeter!
Hold them back on the right side!

03:14.160 --> 03:17.289
Come on, kids, let's go!
Let's go! Move it! Come on!

03:20.640 --> 03:22.130
Keep moving! Keep moving!

03:26.120 --> 03:28.441
Tell him to take off! We're clear!

04:15.320 --> 04:16.765
You kids doing all right?

04:18.000 --> 04:21.800
Sorry about all the fuss.
We had ourselves a bit of a swarm.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.689
Who are you?

04:24.360 --> 04:26.761
I'm the reason you're all still alive.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.002
It's my intention to keep you that way.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.841
Now, come with me.
We'll get you kids squared away.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.891
You can call me Mr. Janson.
I run this place.

04:39.040 --> 04:45.002
For us it is a sanctuary,
safe from the horrors of the outside world.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.642
You all should think of it
as a way station.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.565
Kind of a home between homes.
Watch yourselves.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.527
That mean you're taking us home?

04:55.360 --> 04:57.203
A home of sorts.

04:57.720 --> 05:00.644
Sadly, there wouldn't be much left
of wherever you came from.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.325
But we do have a place for you.

05:02.480 --> 05:08.010
A refuge, outside the Scorch,
where WICKED will never find you again.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.168
How does that sound?

05:12.080 --> 05:13.684
Why are you helping us?

05:13.840 --> 05:16.684
Let's just say the world out there
is in a rather precarious situation.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.081
We're all hanging on
by a very thin thread.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.368
The fact that you kids
can survive the Flare virus...

05:21.520 --> 05:25.491
makes you the best chance
of humanity's continued survival.

05:25.640 --> 05:32.171
Unfortunately, it also makes you a target,
as no doubt by now you've noticed.

05:33.240 --> 05:37.086
Beyond this door lies the beginning
of your new lives.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.929
First things first...

05:42.080 --> 05:45.289
let's do something about that smell.

05:46.600 --> 05:47.601
All right!

05:47.760 --> 05:49.046
Oh, man!

05:49.240 --> 05:50.366
Feels great!

05:51.280 --> 05:53.089
Frypan, how you feel over there?

06:11.280 --> 06:13.203
Wait, what is that?

06:13.360 --> 06:17.001
Just a little cocktail.
Calcium, folate, vitamins A through Z.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.891
Pretty much everything
you've been deprived of out there.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.530
Try to relax.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.444
Sure you got enough there?

06:36.880 --> 06:37.881
Evening, Dr. Crawford.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.367
Good evening.
How are the new arrivals holding up?

06:40.520 --> 06:41.965
So far, so good.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.770
All right.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.403
And you must be Teresa.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.481
Thomas?

06:52.920 --> 06:53.887
Yeah?

06:54.320 --> 06:55.731
Come with me, please.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.528
Thomas, thank you for seeing me.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.567
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

07:22.720 --> 07:27.169
I was just hoping we might get a moment
to chat in private, away from the others.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.121
Well...

07:31.920 --> 07:34.082
I won't take up too much of your time.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.770
I really only have one question.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.770
What do you remember about WICKED?

07:45.440 --> 07:46.771
You're not in trouble.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.931
We're just having a conversation.
I'm just trying to understand.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.769
Understand what?

07:54.760 --> 07:57.161
Whose side are you on?

08:05.120 --> 08:08.124
I remember I used to work for WICKED.

08:10.520 --> 08:13.046
I remember that they sent me
into the maze.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.244
I remember watching my friends die
in front of me.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.082
I'm on their side.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.851
Interesting.

08:31.840 --> 08:36.208
You say you worked for WICKED,
but they sent you into the maze.

08:36.360 --> 08:37.770
Why would they do something like that?

08:37.919 --> 08:41.082
I don't know. Maybe you should've
asked them before you killed them all.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.286
I'll be sure to keep that in mind.

08:48.680 --> 08:50.170
Enjoy the rest of your stay.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.206
That's it?

08:52.360 --> 08:54.249
Yeah, you've told me
everything I need to know.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.529
You and your friends have all
been cleared to join the others.

08:57.720 --> 09:00.849
Soon you'll all be moving
on to greener pastures.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.007
Wait.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.126
Others?

09:20.960 --> 09:22.166
Hey, Thomas!

09:23.040 --> 09:24.644
Hey, Minho, what's going on?

09:24.800 --> 09:26.689
We weren't the only maze. Come on.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.323
And there was this big, loud explosion,
and these guys came out of nowhere.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.243
Started shooting up the place.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.640
It was intense.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.082
They pulled us out of the maze
and brought us here.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.730
What about the rest?

09:43.080 --> 09:45.606
The other people left behind in the maze,
what happened to them?

09:46.560 --> 09:47.766
I don't know.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.048
I guess WICKED still has them.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.129
- How long you guys been here?
- Not long.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.845
Just a day or two.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.446
That kid over there has been here
the longest.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.209
Almost a week.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.404
His maze was nothing but girls.

10:04.640 --> 10:05.641
Really?

10:06.840 --> 10:08.808
Some guys have all the luck.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.085
Good evening, gentlemen. Ladies.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.443
You all know how this works.
If you hear your name called...

10:15.840 --> 10:19.128
please rise in an orderly fashion,
join my colleagues behind me...

10:19.280 --> 10:20.930
where they will escort you
to the eastern wing.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.287
Your new lives are about to begin.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.748
Connor.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.362
- Evelyn.
- Ev!

10:35.760 --> 10:37.068
Justin.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.811
Peter.

10:40.480 --> 10:41.845
Allison.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.446
Squiggy.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.211
All right. Settle down.

10:47.880 --> 10:51.487
Franklin. And Abigail.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.290
Now, now, don't get discouraged.
If I could take more, I would.

10:57.440 --> 11:02.162
There's always tomorrow.
Your time will come.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.130
Go on, eat up.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.211
Where are they going?

11:09.720 --> 11:11.131
Far from here.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.324
Lucky bastards.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.405
Some kind of farm. A safe place.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.006
They can only take in
a couple of people at a time.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.725
What the hell?

11:32.400 --> 11:33.686
Hey, Teresa?

11:36.040 --> 11:37.007
Teresa!

11:38.280 --> 11:39.327
Hey, hey, hey.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.970
Where are they taking her?

11:42.480 --> 11:44.289
They just have to run a few more tests.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.647
Don't worry,
they'll be done with her soon.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.529
Is she okay?

11:49.160 --> 11:50.400
She's fine.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.164
I got top bunk.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.924
Too slow.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.484
I could get used to this.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.690
Yeah. It's not bad.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.527
Hey, what do you think
those guys want with Teresa?

12:20.320 --> 12:23.961
Now, if there's one thing I know about
that girl, she can take care of herself.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.049
Don't worry about it.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.047
Hey.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.326
Down here.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.530
Oh, my God.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.806
Come on. Follow me.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.201
What?

13:12.520 --> 13:14.045
Hurry, this way.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.206
Come on.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.889
Hey, wait a second.
What the hell are we doing?

13:33.240 --> 13:34.890
Come on, we're gonna miss it.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.928
What the hell am I doing?

13:46.160 --> 13:47.491
What are we doing?

13:48.560 --> 13:49.686
Come here.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.081
Watch.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.642
What the hell was that?

14:40.920 --> 14:43.287
They bring in new ones every night
like clockwork.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.085
You know what they do with them?

14:46.800 --> 14:50.122
I don't know.
This is as far as I've ever gotten.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.765
The vents don't even go
into that section.

14:52.800 --> 14:56.771
But once they go through that door,
they don't come back out.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.846
I don't think anybody
ever really leaves this place.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.643
Come on. We've gotta go
before somebody notices we're gone.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.889
Why did you show me this?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.321
Because maybe the others
will listen to you.

15:16.480 --> 15:21.247
There's something weird going on here.
And I know you think so too.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.729
Hey, wait.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.685
What's your name?

15:28.360 --> 15:29.691
Aris.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.201
Alice.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.046
Barry.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.371
Walt.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.045
Edgar.

15:47.360 --> 15:50.442
- Samantha.
- I wanna know what's through that door.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.811
- Aaron.
- Now, we've been over this.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.247
You said they were covered up,
so you don't know what you saw.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.640
- Dennis.
- It could've been anything under there.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.350
I know exactly what I saw.
They were bodies.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.608
Aris said they bring in
a new batch every night.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.171
Who the hell is Aris?

16:04.320 --> 16:05.367
Henry.

16:07.360 --> 16:11.166
- Tim.
- Well, I'm sold.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.001
And last but not least, David.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.887
Thank you for your attention.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.887
Okay, until we know anything for certain,
we should just keep our heads down...

16:26.040 --> 16:28.691
and try not to draw any attention
to ourselves, all right?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.286
What is he doing?

16:34.440 --> 16:36.805
I think he's drawing
attention to himself.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.522
Hang on. You weren't called.

16:41.680 --> 16:44.564
- I know, I'm just gonna be a second.
- This is a restricted area, kid.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.321
I just wanna see my friend.
Can you let me through?

16:50.160 --> 16:52.606
Get your ass back in that chair.

16:55.560 --> 17:00.122
Just remember, you are always being
monitored. Breaking the rules...

17:01.400 --> 17:02.287
Back off!

17:02.560 --> 17:04.243
What's your problem, man?
What the hell, huh?

17:04.400 --> 17:06.731
- Back off!
- Why won't you let me see her?

17:06.920 --> 17:09.161
- Control your friend!
- What's happening here?

17:11.680 --> 17:13.090
Thomas?

17:13.240 --> 17:15.128
I thought we could trust each other.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.486
You know we're all
on the same team here.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.646
Are we?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.480
Get them to their bunks.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.241
Get your asses in there! All of you!

17:38.760 --> 17:40.171
What the hell was that about?

17:40.320 --> 17:42.084
You didn't really think
they were just gonna let you through?

17:42.240 --> 17:43.810
Nah, of course I didn't.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.487
I'm gonna find out
what's on the other side of that door.

17:47.640 --> 17:48.721
Right.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.651
Newt, they're hiding something. Okay?

17:50.840 --> 17:52.410
These people are not
who they say they are.

17:52.560 --> 17:53.607
No, Thomas, you don't know that!

17:55.160 --> 17:58.448
The only thing that we do know
is that they helped rescue us from WICKED.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.683
They gave us new clothes. They gave us food.
They gave us a proper bed.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.605
Some of us haven't had that
in a long time.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.602
- Yeah, but...
- Some of us a lot longer than others.

18:09.840 --> 18:10.762
Hey, Thomas.

18:10.920 --> 18:11.921
What the...

18:12.240 --> 18:13.321
You got it, didn't you?

18:13.480 --> 18:15.448
Yeah. Let's go.

18:16.320 --> 18:19.210
All right, look, maybe you guys are right.
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.649
But I got to find out for sure.
Just cover for me.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.325
I'll be back as soon as I can.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.970
What the hell?

20:19.800 --> 20:20.642
Teresa?

20:37.360 --> 20:38.600
It's Rachel.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.490
They took her the first night.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.922
I told her it was going to be okay.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.045
You sure this can't wait?

21:00.840 --> 21:04.085
She was very specific, sir.
She wanted to speak with you personally.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.681
As if I don't have enough to deal with.

21:07.040 --> 21:11.329
Just bear with me.
I'm getting some interference from the storm.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.848
Come on. It's good enough.
Make the connection.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.645
Good evening, Doctor Paige.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.325
Lovely to see you again.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.720
Although I admit...

21:20.920 --> 21:23.764
I wasn't expecting to hear from you
quite so soon.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.524
Change of plans, Janson.

21:25.720 --> 21:29.361
I'll be arriving a little sooner
than expected. First thing tomorrow.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.803
We'll be delighted to have you.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.651
I think you'll be pleased
with the progress we've made.

21:36.600 --> 21:41.083
As you can see, early results
have been extremely promising.

21:41.600 --> 21:45.730
Whatever it is you've been doing
to them in there, it's working.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.209
Not well enough.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.689
I just received board approval.

21:53.840 --> 21:58.448
I want all the remaining subjects sedated
and prepped for harvest by the time I arrive.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.970
Doctor Paige, we are going
as fast as we can.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.201
We are still running tests...

22:03.360 --> 22:05.089
Try something faster.

22:05.640 --> 22:09.770
Until I can guarantee their security,
this is the best plan.

22:10.040 --> 22:13.681
Ma'am, security is my job.
We're on 24 hour lockdown here.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.251
I am assuring you...

22:15.400 --> 22:17.801
the assets are secure.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.088
Have you found the Right Arm?

22:21.080 --> 22:22.127
Not yet.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.765
We tracked them as far as the mountains.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.160
So they're still out there.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.761
And they've already hit
two of our installations.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.363
They want these kids as badly as we do.
And I cannot...

22:33.600 --> 22:36.331
I cannot afford another loss.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.131
Not now, when I am so close to a cure.

22:41.800 --> 22:45.202
If you are not up to the task,
I will find someone who is.

22:45.360 --> 22:46.964
That won't be necessary.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.807
Might I suggest we start
with the most recent arrivals.

22:51.960 --> 22:54.281
Just get it done.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.201
Janson.

22:59.120 --> 23:01.646
I don't want them to feel any pain.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.804
They won't feel a thing.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.068
Thomas!

23:30.480 --> 23:32.687
We gotta go. We gotta go right now.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.683
- What the hell are you talking about?
- What do you mean, "We gotta go?"

23:34.840 --> 23:36.365
They're coming. Come on. We gotta go.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.766
They're coming for us.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.764
- Paige. She's still alive.
- What happened in there?

23:44.920 --> 23:45.842
Aris, what happened?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.570
Thomas, can you just calm down
and talk to us.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.529
- She's still alive.
- Who's she? Teresa?

23:49.680 --> 23:51.442
- Ava.
- Ava?

23:51.600 --> 23:54.371
- Will you just turn around and talk to us?
- It's WICKED!

23:56.000 --> 23:57.001
It's still WICKED.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.201
It's always been WICKED.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.606
Thomas.

24:09.880 --> 24:11.803
What did you see?

24:49.160 --> 24:50.321
Come on, come on.

24:51.800 --> 24:52.847
Okay, let's go.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.411
You guys go ahead.
There's something I gotta do.

24:54.560 --> 24:55.607
What are you talking about?

24:55.800 --> 24:59.088
Trust me, it's important. You guys wanna
get outta here, right? Just go.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.765
- I'll go with him.
- Okay, Winston, go! Go! Come on.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.081
You sure we can trust this kid?

25:03.240 --> 25:05.751
You don't want to know
where we'd be without him.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.647
What are you kids doing out?

25:18.600 --> 25:20.762
I want this place locked down.
Call everyone in.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.809
No one leaves until
everyone's accounted for.

25:23.280 --> 25:25.811
- Tell me you've got eyes on them.
- Still looking, still looking.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.889
Come on, come on, come on.

25:29.680 --> 25:30.647
There.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.122
Who is that?

25:34.280 --> 25:37.807
Crawford. Going after the girl.

25:37.960 --> 25:40.087
- Get everyone to the med wing.
- Yes, sir.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.241
I want them alive.

25:47.160 --> 25:48.922
Freeze! Stay where you are!

25:51.440 --> 25:52.680
- Why are they shooting at us?
- I've spotted them!

25:52.840 --> 25:53.966
- They're in L-3!
- Minho!

25:54.120 --> 25:55.724
- I'm in pursuit!
- What the hell are you doing?

25:55.880 --> 25:57.041
Minho!

26:04.600 --> 26:06.125
Shit, Minho!

26:07.760 --> 26:11.082
Okay. Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.888
Dr. Crawford, are you here to...
Wait, wait. Okay, okay.

26:22.040 --> 26:25.761
Where is she? Where is she!

26:31.080 --> 26:32.241
Get over!

26:32.920 --> 26:33.842
Get down!

26:34.000 --> 26:35.047
- Teresa.
- Get down!

26:35.200 --> 26:36.964
- Okay, hands, give me your hands!
- Just do what he says.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.122
- What did they do to you?
- Thomas?

26:39.320 --> 26:41.960
- Give me your hands!
- You're never gonna get away with this.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.611
- What's going on?
- We gotta leave right now. Come on.

26:44.760 --> 26:46.762
Guys? They're coming! Where do we go?

26:47.160 --> 26:48.286
Frypan! Move!

26:51.800 --> 26:53.450
Get back! Get back!

26:53.640 --> 26:56.120
They've got the door barricaded.
Send backup!

26:56.280 --> 26:58.761
Okay, we gotta get outta here!
Where do we go?

26:58.920 --> 27:01.160
- Push!
- Everyone stand back!

27:01.800 --> 27:02.528
Come on!

27:03.240 --> 27:04.241
Newt! Help, help!

27:04.680 --> 27:05.647
Ready?

27:07.040 --> 27:08.485
Go, go, go!

27:08.640 --> 27:10.369
- Get out of the way!
- Come on, come on!

27:10.560 --> 27:12.927
- Come on, come on!
- Get someone on the other side!

27:13.080 --> 27:14.366
Watch your feet!

27:14.520 --> 27:16.488
- Hurry! Let's go!
- Come on, move! Move! Move!

27:17.440 --> 27:18.668
Thomas!

27:18.800 --> 27:20.068
Let's go!

27:20.200 --> 27:21.804
Stay behind me!

27:27.840 --> 27:31.128
Shit. Okay, come on!

27:33.880 --> 27:35.405
Stop!

27:37.880 --> 27:39.245
There it is! There it is!

27:39.600 --> 27:40.886
Converge on level 3.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.530
All R-16 personnel...

27:42.720 --> 27:44.882
non-lethal force only.

27:46.800 --> 27:47.847
Shit. Come on!

27:48.000 --> 27:49.650
No, no, no!

27:49.800 --> 27:51.086
Thomas!

27:57.320 --> 27:58.731
Open this door, Janson!

27:58.880 --> 28:00.041
You really don't want me to.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.446
Open the damn door!

28:01.600 --> 28:04.365
Listen to me!
I'm trying to save your life.

28:04.520 --> 28:06.841
The maze is one thing, but you kids
wouldn't last one day...

28:07.000 --> 28:08.968
out in the Scorch.

28:09.160 --> 28:11.561
If the elements don't kill you,
the Cranks will.

28:12.160 --> 28:15.209
Thomas, you have to believe me.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.804
I only want what's best for you.

28:19.840 --> 28:22.127
Yeah, let me guess. WICKED is good?

28:25.680 --> 28:27.887
You're not getting through
that door, Thomas.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.451
- Hey, guys.
- Come on!

28:35.880 --> 28:37.609
Thomas! Come on! Let's go!

28:45.040 --> 28:46.041
Go, go. Stop him!

28:46.240 --> 28:47.844
Shut the main vault door!

28:50.080 --> 28:51.366
- No!
- Thomas?

28:51.520 --> 28:53.284
Come on, Thomas! Come on!

28:57.240 --> 28:59.208
- Move! Move!
- Thomas, what's going on?

29:11.280 --> 29:13.605
- Come on.
- You little shit.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.202
Come on, Thomas. Let's go. Come on!

29:21.720 --> 29:22.721
Come on. Keep moving!

29:24.240 --> 29:25.730
Come on. Come on!

29:37.760 --> 29:38.966
Come on, come on!

29:44.200 --> 29:45.406
Fan out!

29:46.440 --> 29:48.363
All right, come on. Keep going!

29:50.240 --> 29:51.785
Shit.

29:53.240 --> 29:56.961
Come on, go! Go!
We'll lose them in the storm!

29:59.880 --> 30:00.802
Notify on visual.

30:00.960 --> 30:01.802
Copy that.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.724
Standby, Two. Be on my six.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.126
Everybody, go, go, go.
Stay low. Stay low!

30:23.560 --> 30:25.449
Teresa, hang on. Stay together!

30:25.600 --> 30:26.931
I think we lost them!

30:27.080 --> 30:28.570
Keep going, guys. Let's go.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.401
Watch out! Where are we even going?

30:32.040 --> 30:34.811
- Come on, Aris. Let's go. Come on!
- Over here!

30:38.240 --> 30:40.605
- Come on!
- Teresa, wait! No, don't go in there!

30:40.760 --> 30:42.140
Get down here!

30:42.240 --> 30:43.605
- Okay, come on!
- Get inside!

30:44.760 --> 30:45.761
Come on, we should go.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.081
Aris, get in!

30:47.280 --> 30:48.566
Let's go, Fry.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.890
Can you hold onto this?

31:04.840 --> 31:06.080
Where the hell are we?

31:07.440 --> 31:08.441
We gotta go.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.170
- No. Thomas, stop!
- We gotta keep moving.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.324
Tell me what's going on.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.285
It's WICKED.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.167
It's WICKED. They lied to us.
We never escaped.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.289
Me and Aris, we found bodies.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.323
Too many to count.

31:26.480 --> 31:28.642
What do you mean? Dead bodies?

31:29.680 --> 31:31.808
No, but they weren't alive either.

31:32.800 --> 31:35.167
They had them strung up.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.924
With tubes coming out of them.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.162
They were being drained.

31:44.880 --> 31:47.326
There's something inside
of us that WICKED wants.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.163
Something in our blood.

31:50.880 --> 31:53.963
So we have to get as far away
from them as possible.

31:57.680 --> 32:01.162
Okay. So, what's the plan?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.126
You do have a plan, right?

32:04.280 --> 32:06.123
Yeah. I don't know.

32:06.560 --> 32:07.846
Well, we followed you
out here, Thomas...

32:08.000 --> 32:09.843
and now you're saying that you have
no idea where we're going...

32:10.000 --> 32:12.321
or what we're doing.

32:14.480 --> 32:20.044
Wait. Janson said something
about people hiding in the mountains.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.567
Some kind of resistance or army.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.051
The Right Arm.

32:26.200 --> 32:29.841
The Right Arm. If they're really
against WICKED, maybe they can help us.

32:31.360 --> 32:35.331
People. In the mountains.
Mountain people.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.687
That's your plan?

32:40.560 --> 32:41.925
It's the only chance we have.

32:43.160 --> 32:44.161
Hey, guys.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.010
Check this out.

32:46.160 --> 32:47.605
Minho, give me a light!

32:52.000 --> 32:53.729
Someone's been down here.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.090
Come on. Open up.

33:26.680 --> 33:27.966
Looks like people lived here.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.844
Where are they now?

33:35.600 --> 33:37.841
Let's pack some of this stuff up.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.328
Anything you think you might need.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.847
We'll split up, see what else we can find.
Meet back here.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.171
Wait, Thomas.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.027
Let's go.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.641
- Thomas.
- Yeah?

34:07.720 --> 34:09.960
All those kids that we
left behind back there.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.164
I don't want to end up like that.

34:16.360 --> 34:17.360
Hey.

34:18.679 --> 34:20.681
Do you hear me?

34:21.960 --> 34:23.962
Yeah, I hear you.

34:24.159 --> 34:27.846
Good. Now, what are we
looking for out here?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.002
Signs of life.

34:32.159 --> 34:36.563
People. Survivors.
Anyone who can help us.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.405
Does he count?

34:54.920 --> 34:56.364
Shit.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.931
They had power.

35:39.480 --> 35:40.561
You all right?

35:42.560 --> 35:43.766
I'm fine.

36:01.280 --> 36:02.281
What?

36:56.120 --> 36:58.009
Where did you go?

37:08.640 --> 37:10.404
This looks promising.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.401
Hey, Minho. Wait!

37:35.840 --> 37:36.807
Thomas, watch out!

37:36.960 --> 37:38.086
Get back, get back!

37:38.640 --> 37:39.641
Jesus.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.165
Her eyes!

37:43.920 --> 37:45.331
Oh, shit.

37:47.240 --> 37:48.162
Stay back!

37:49.760 --> 37:51.569
What the hell is that thing?

37:55.040 --> 37:56.326
Gotta move! Go!

37:59.280 --> 38:00.327
Go!

38:03.520 --> 38:04.885
- Hold it down!
- What?

38:05.040 --> 38:07.850
- Hold it down!
- Minho, what are you doing?

38:10.280 --> 38:11.611
Watch out! Watch out!

38:17.720 --> 38:19.529
Go, go, go!

38:22.040 --> 38:23.610
Let's get the hell out of here!

38:27.480 --> 38:28.561
Shit.

38:29.520 --> 38:30.567
What's going on?

38:30.720 --> 38:31.926
I don't know.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.200
Hey!

38:36.560 --> 38:37.607
Hey!

38:37.760 --> 38:39.268
Run!

38:40.080 --> 38:41.570
Go!

38:43.800 --> 38:45.006
Shit!

38:45.240 --> 38:46.541
Hey!

38:47.160 --> 38:49.321
- Go!
- Get outta here!

38:49.720 --> 38:50.926
Run!

38:51.080 --> 38:52.481
Come on!

38:53.840 --> 38:55.763
Let's go, go, go!

38:57.640 --> 38:58.641
Let's go!

38:59.600 --> 39:01.329
Thomas, Minho,
what the hell are those things?

39:01.520 --> 39:03.045
I don't know. Just keep going!

39:04.080 --> 39:05.206
Move! Move!

39:05.600 --> 39:06.726
Where do we go?

39:06.880 --> 39:08.803
Come on, keep moving!

39:13.680 --> 39:15.409
- Aris, no!
- No!

39:24.480 --> 39:25.641
Go! Go around!

39:26.960 --> 39:28.563
Teresa!

39:36.840 --> 39:37.841
Minho, come on!

39:39.120 --> 39:41.168
Come on, come on!

39:42.520 --> 39:43.885
Where the hell are we gonna go?

39:44.920 --> 39:46.684
We gotta find a way out of here!

39:47.200 --> 39:48.326
Go!

39:48.600 --> 39:49.761
Faster, faster!

39:51.680 --> 39:54.206
Newt! Newt!

39:54.360 --> 39:55.646
Guys, help!

40:01.960 --> 40:05.247
- Newt, you good?
- Yeah. Thanks, Tommy.

40:06.240 --> 40:08.004
- Come on, Newt!
- Keep going!

40:08.160 --> 40:10.447
Through here, through here!
Let's go! They're coming!

40:14.480 --> 40:15.481
Guys, where are we going?

40:16.000 --> 40:17.161
Okay, run! Go! Go!

40:23.480 --> 40:25.482
- Just keep going!
- Come on, they're coming!

40:28.520 --> 40:29.760
It's a dead end!

40:30.160 --> 40:31.969
Get us out of here, Thomas!

40:32.440 --> 40:33.362
This one!

40:36.360 --> 40:38.203
I'll hold them back!

40:38.360 --> 40:39.361
Harder!

40:46.200 --> 40:47.531
Get that door open!

40:47.680 --> 40:48.681
Move!

40:48.880 --> 40:50.530
Come on, Frypan! Let's go!

40:51.040 --> 40:52.041
Come on! It's open!

40:52.880 --> 40:55.486
Everyone through! Come on! Come on!

40:56.320 --> 40:57.526
Winston!

40:58.440 --> 40:59.885
Help me!

41:00.040 --> 41:01.530
Help! Please!

41:02.120 --> 41:04.487
Please! Oh, my God!

41:10.040 --> 41:11.041
Go, go, go!

41:11.200 --> 41:13.248
- Get up, Winston!
- Hurry!

41:13.640 --> 41:15.961
- Minho, go! I'm right behind you!
- Let's go! Let's go!

41:43.080 --> 41:44.081
Thomas. Get in.

42:10.760 --> 42:12.410
Hey! Get out of here!

42:23.680 --> 42:25.489
Are they gone?

42:26.080 --> 42:28.242
Yeah, I think we're safe for now.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.964
Okay, we should get moving.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.804
Let's pack it up.

42:33.960 --> 42:35.007
Aris, come on.

42:35.160 --> 42:37.128
Fry, Winston. Let's go.

42:40.280 --> 42:42.008
Hey, man.

42:42.120 --> 42:43.963
You okay?

43:29.080 --> 43:31.208
What the hell happened to this place?

43:31.800 --> 43:33.006
I don't know.

43:33.720 --> 43:36.371
It doesn't look like anyone's been here
in a long time.

43:38.040 --> 43:40.771
I hope the whole world's not like this.

43:44.200 --> 43:45.884
Hang on, stop.

43:49.840 --> 43:51.080
Do you hear that?

44:01.400 --> 44:03.811
Get down! Everybody, hide! Hide! Hide!

44:03.960 --> 44:05.962
Get in here. In here, in here!

44:14.240 --> 44:15.480
Oh, shit.

44:27.240 --> 44:30.608
They're never gonna stop looking for us,
are they?

44:41.360 --> 44:43.442
Everyone good?

44:44.440 --> 44:45.771
Yeah.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.131
A little further, guys.

45:14.480 --> 45:16.289
Those mountains, that's gotta be it.

45:17.400 --> 45:18.970
That's where we're going.

45:20.880 --> 45:22.803
That's a long way off.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.170
Then we better get moving.

45:28.360 --> 45:30.203
Winston! Hey, Winston!

45:35.000 --> 45:37.526
Winston!

45:37.680 --> 45:38.681
He's hurt pretty bad.

45:38.880 --> 45:40.848
What do we do?

45:43.680 --> 45:44.647
Shit.

45:45.480 --> 45:47.209
Winston. Can you hear me?

45:49.000 --> 45:50.001
It's okay.

46:00.640 --> 46:02.130
Hang in there, Winston.

46:11.440 --> 46:12.922
Thomas.

46:13.022 --> 46:15.365
- Grab his legs.
- I got him, I got him.

46:28.680 --> 46:30.125
Gotta find shelter!

46:37.760 --> 46:38.886
Thanks.

46:59.320 --> 47:01.049
It's like they're getting further away.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.721
We just gotta keep moving.
We can make it.

47:06.320 --> 47:07.560
How's it looking?

47:11.080 --> 47:12.525
It's a little further.

47:16.080 --> 47:17.889
That's not very convincing.

47:20.200 --> 47:22.601
Hey, what's going on with you?

47:25.400 --> 47:27.289
They did something to me.

47:32.920 --> 47:37.926
At first it just felt like I was waking up
from a dream or something.

47:40.280 --> 47:42.681
Then they all started coming back.

47:43.600 --> 47:44.965
Your memories?

47:46.920 --> 47:47.921
What do you remember?

47:50.200 --> 47:52.806
I remember the first time
they brought you in.

47:55.120 --> 47:58.124
I was taller than you then. And faster.

47:58.280 --> 47:59.566
Okay.

48:04.120 --> 48:06.248
And I remember why we were there.

48:09.600 --> 48:11.648
We thought we could fix all this.

48:21.280 --> 48:23.601
I think we should go back.

48:25.920 --> 48:28.127
- What?
- Just listen to me.

48:28.280 --> 48:30.886
What are you talking about? Go back?
After everything they've done to us.

48:31.040 --> 48:32.087
No, it's not that simple.

48:32.240 --> 48:33.446
Yeah, I think it is that simple.

48:33.600 --> 48:35.841
No. You don't understand.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.490
What don't I understand?

48:37.680 --> 48:39.648
Everything was fine until you...

48:40.760 --> 48:42.125
What?

48:46.000 --> 48:47.206
Nothing.

48:48.240 --> 48:51.005
Teresa, what aren't you telling me?

48:54.600 --> 48:56.561
Hey! Guys, get down here!

48:56.720 --> 48:58.290
Winston what are you doing, man?

48:58.440 --> 49:00.169
- Give me that!
- What's going on?

49:00.320 --> 49:01.446
- What happened?
- I don't know.

49:01.600 --> 49:03.329
He just woke up and grabbed the gun
and then he tried to...

49:03.480 --> 49:04.766
Give it back, please.

49:04.960 --> 49:06.121
Winston, are you okay?

49:20.000 --> 49:22.241
It's growing...

49:23.560 --> 49:24.686
inside me.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.324
I'm not gonna make it.

49:43.520 --> 49:45.363
Please. Please.

49:45.520 --> 49:49.411
Don't let me turn
into one of those things.

50:04.760 --> 50:06.046
Wait, Newt...

50:20.840 --> 50:22.490
Thank you.

50:26.120 --> 50:29.522
Now, get outta here.

50:32.640 --> 50:35.007
Good-bye, Winston.

50:50.760 --> 50:51.886
Go.

51:14.360 --> 51:16.567
It's okay.

51:19.960 --> 51:21.325
I'm sorry.

51:29.240 --> 51:30.890
Thomas.

51:31.040 --> 51:32.644
Take care of them.

52:12.360 --> 52:15.523
I thought we were supposed to be immune.

52:16.200 --> 52:20.046
Not all of us, I guess.

52:22.760 --> 52:24.000
If Winston can get infected...

52:24.200 --> 52:26.567
we should assume so can the rest of us.

52:30.120 --> 52:32.168
I never thought I'd say it...

52:35.480 --> 52:38.086
I miss the Glade.

53:51.480 --> 53:53.323
Hey. Hey.

53:54.880 --> 53:56.100
Get up.

53:56.200 --> 54:00.407
Newt, get up. Come on, let's go.
Frypan, Aris. I see something.

54:00.560 --> 54:02.221
What is it? What...

54:02.640 --> 54:04.005
You see that?

54:06.600 --> 54:07.886
It's lights.

54:09.080 --> 54:10.127
We made it.

54:19.200 --> 54:21.521
Let's go. We gotta go. Come on.

54:21.920 --> 54:23.490
Come on, let's go. Let's go!

54:35.640 --> 54:37.327
- Hurry!
- Go!

54:38.000 --> 54:39.001
Run!

54:41.200 --> 54:42.531
Keep moving! Come on!

54:42.680 --> 54:43.727
Let's go!

54:47.040 --> 54:48.804
Come on, Teresa!

54:48.960 --> 54:49.927
Go, go, go!

54:50.080 --> 54:51.366
We're getting closer!

54:53.360 --> 54:54.691
Keep going!

55:03.800 --> 55:05.564
Get inside! Go!

55:07.920 --> 55:09.126
Oh, shi...

55:22.160 --> 55:23.446
Minho!

55:30.680 --> 55:32.250
Come help him!

55:37.920 --> 55:40.127
Come on, get him up.

55:44.720 --> 55:45.721
Keep going!

55:46.800 --> 55:47.881
Go!

55:50.600 --> 55:52.806
Move! Come on! Hurry up!

55:52.960 --> 55:54.883
Come on! Get in.

55:58.040 --> 55:59.967
Put him down. Watch his head.

56:00.120 --> 56:01.610
Who's got a light?

56:03.040 --> 56:04.201
Minho!

56:05.600 --> 56:07.364
- Come on, come on.
- Minho?

56:07.520 --> 56:08.681
Minho?

56:08.880 --> 56:10.211
Come on, Minho.

56:13.880 --> 56:14.927
Come on, man.

56:22.000 --> 56:23.240
There he is.

56:23.440 --> 56:24.441
There you go.

56:24.600 --> 56:26.887
Here you are. Are you okay?

56:28.600 --> 56:29.647
What happened?

56:32.480 --> 56:34.244
I think you got struck by lightning.

56:38.880 --> 56:40.166
Come on, let's get him up.

56:40.320 --> 56:41.731
Nice and slow.

56:42.360 --> 56:43.282
Okay.

56:43.440 --> 56:44.441
Let's get him up.

56:44.600 --> 56:46.608
Think you can get up? Yeah?

56:49.520 --> 56:51.249
Oh, my God.

56:55.200 --> 56:57.127
- Thanks, guys.
- Hey.

56:59.200 --> 57:01.601
What's that smell?

57:07.840 --> 57:08.841
Behind you!

57:16.920 --> 57:19.321
Oh, shit! Oh, my God.

57:21.800 --> 57:23.370
I see you've met our guard dogs.

57:25.480 --> 57:27.005
Who's that?

57:35.560 --> 57:37.369
Stay back! Stay back!

57:40.640 --> 57:42.369
You guys look like shit.

57:44.600 --> 57:46.011
Come on. Follow me.

57:48.560 --> 57:51.086
Unless you want to stay here with them.

58:04.840 --> 58:06.046
Oh, my.

58:08.120 --> 58:09.485
Come on, keep up.

58:09.640 --> 58:11.688
Jorge wants to meet you.

58:16.760 --> 58:18.046
Who's Jorge?

58:20.640 --> 58:22.182
You'll see.

58:22.680 --> 58:25.251
No one's come out of the Scorch
in a long time.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.764
You've just got him curious.

58:29.760 --> 58:31.171
And me, too.

58:38.360 --> 58:40.761
Anyone else starting to get
a bad feeling about this place?

58:41.360 --> 58:43.328
Let's just hear him out.
See what he has to say.

58:52.120 --> 58:53.645
Jorge, they're here.

58:55.280 --> 58:56.722
Quiet.

59:00.320 --> 59:01.481
Damn it.

59:13.560 --> 59:16.166
Do you ever get the feeling
the whole world's against you?

59:19.880 --> 59:23.965
Three questions.
Where did you come from?

59:24.960 --> 59:26.689
Where are you going?

59:27.200 --> 59:28.804
How can I profit?

59:34.320 --> 59:36.368
Don't all answer at once.

59:37.320 --> 59:41.484
We're headed for the mountains.
Looking for the Right Arm.

59:44.400 --> 59:46.323
You're looking for ghosts, you mean.

59:52.400 --> 59:54.050
Question number two.

59:56.520 --> 59:58.568
Where did you come from?

59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.245
That's our business.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.362
Hey!

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.851
Get the hell off me!

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.724
Get the hell off me, man!

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.725
Shut up, you big baby.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.688
What is that?

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.291
You were right.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.882
Right about what?
What is she talking about?

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.363
I'm sorry, hermano.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.883
Looks like you're tagged.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.043
You came from WICKED.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.084
Which means...

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.720
you're very valuable.

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.920
Good plan, Thomas.
"Just hear what the man has to say."

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.810
Really working out for us.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.450
Shut up, Minho.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.082
Maybe I can reach the rope.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.088
Enjoying the view?

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.482
What the hell do you want?

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.043
That is the question.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.241
My men want to sell you back to WICKED.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:33.089
Life has taught them to think small.
I'm not like that.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.409
Something tells me
that you're not either.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:39.167
Is the blood rushing to my head
or is this shank not making any sense?

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:45.120
Tell me what you know
about the Right Arm.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.803
I thought you said they were ghosts.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.122
I happen to believe in ghosts.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.444
Especially when I hear them
chattering on the airwaves.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:07.801
You tell me what you know,
and maybe we can make a deal.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.965
We don't know much.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.811
Okay! Okay, all right.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.282
They're hiding in the mountains.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.886
And they attacked WICKED.
They got out a bunch of kids.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.485
That's it. That's all we know.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.010
Yo, Jorge.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.166
What's going on?

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.721
Me and my new friends
were just getting acquainted.

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.005
We're done now.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.202
Hey, wait. You're not gonna help us?

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.369
Don't worry, hermano.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.171
We'll get you back to where you belong.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.241
Hang tight.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.050
Going somewhere?

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.764
We both are.

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.844
Pack what you need. Do it quietly.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.050
Where exactly are we going?

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.723
It's real, Bren.
These kids are our ticket.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.247
The Right Arm can't turn us away.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.090
Go now.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.250
Okay. I got it.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.845
Minho, ready?

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.081
Yeah.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:02.401
Gotcha. Okay. One, two, here we go.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.925
- Ready?
- Three.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.609
Oh, shit.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.527
In position. Send them in.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.851
Come on, Minho. Push her harder!

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.001
Shit.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.041
This is it. One...

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.770
two... three!

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.404
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.561
Okay.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.367
Teresa, hurry!

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.846
So what,
you're just gonna give it all up?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.081
Everything you've built?

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.004
There's no future here.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.841
What happens when another gang
finds this place?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.651
And I lose control,
and I can't protect you.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:27.007
I don't need you to protect me.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.491
What happens if you get the Flare?

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.483
What am I supposed to do then?

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.529
Chain you up, watch you turn?

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.570
Put a bullet in your head?
Is that what you expect of me?

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.366
I would do the same thing for you.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.291
Good evening!

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.171
This is the
World Catastrophe Killzone Department.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.042
We have your compound
completely surrounded.

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.565
You find yourselves,
through no fault of your own...

01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.762
in possession of WICKED property.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.967
Barkley.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.723
Return them to us unharmed and we'll
consider this a simple misunderstanding.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.380
Hang on, guys.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:08.688
- Or you can resist...
- Newt!

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.923
...and every last one of you will die.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:16.201
It won't be long before
the Flare wipes out the rest of us.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.682
The hope of a cure lies in your hands.

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.481
The choice is yours.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.530
Go get the kids.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.010
What are you gonna do?

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:31.686
I'm gonna play 'em my favorite song.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.331
Oh, shit.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.051
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.881
We're not trying to cause any trouble, okay?
We just got to get out of here.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.485
Is that so?

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:49.291
Janson, I got 'em for ya.
I'm bringing 'em down.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.925
Don't shoot us.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:54.050
Come on. Let's go.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.488
I said let's go.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.770
You little bastard!

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.284
Okay. Come on.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.968
Come on! Let's go!

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.563
Barkley, what's your location?

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.291
Barkley, are you there?

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.482
Sir, you hearing this?

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.170
What is that?

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.170
Brenda! Hurry!

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:16.163
We don't have much time!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.330
Right this way!

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.363
You gotta be kidding me.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.725
Plan B, hermano.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.843
You kids wanna get to the Right Arm?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.162
I'll lead you to them.
But you're gonna owe me.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.167
Follow me!

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.243
All right! Let's go!

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.484
- Come on!
- Everyone, go.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.210
Go! Come on.

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:43.520
- Come on!
- Aris, come on.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.170
All units, push in!

01:08:51.319 --> 01:08:53.049
They're on the top floor! Top floor!

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.531
We're on the move!

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.921
- Go!
- Go, Aris, go.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.385
Teresa, you're next. Come on.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.050
Brenda! Where you going?

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.368
Just go. I'm right behind you.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.567
Hurry.

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:10.880
Alpha 22 in pursuit. We're on the move!

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.725
Brenda, come on. What are you doing?

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.087
We gotta go!

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:18.401
- I got it.
- Come on.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.046
Shit.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.041
Take cover!

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:25.921
Go! Go!

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.041
Shit!

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:36.210
Come on, hurry!
We're running out of time!

01:09:40.279 --> 01:09:41.725
- On the east!
- Cut 'em off!

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.720
I got eyes on!

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.286
Here, follow me!

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:48.362
Come on!

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.921
Stop! Stay right where you are!

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.045
Shit.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.204
No, we need them.
You go around. I'll go after them.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.520
Over here. Over here.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:07.727
Kid, don't move!

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.450
Brenda, where are we going?

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.043
Hurry! The song's almost over!

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.166
Holy shit!

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:31.961
Come on.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.724
Thomas! Come on!

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.681
Are you okay?

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.409
Yeah, great.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.724
No, no. How are we gonna
get back to the others?

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.121
Relax. I'm gonna get us out of here.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.281
Here.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.724
Why are you helping us?

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.722
Trust me, it's not my idea.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.930
Jorge seems to think you guys
are our ticket to the safe haven.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.971
The what?

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.566
You know, paradise.

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.210
Safe from the sun, free of infection.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.324
Supposedly, the Right Arm's
been taking kids there for years.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.731
Immunes, anyway.

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.004
And you know where that is?

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.201
No.

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.805
But Jorge knows a guy. Marcus.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.602
He used to smuggle kids
up into the mountains.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:21.127
If Jorge made it out,
that's where he'll be taking your friends.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.691
If he made it out?

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.281
You ask a lot of questions.

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:29.967
Can you just come over here
and help me with this?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.445
Please.

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.963
Well, that doesn't sound good.

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.721
Yeah.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.161
Down here they'll be full term.

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.524
Let's go.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.924
I think it's this way.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.571
You think?

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.962
Do people live down here?

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.930
The Solar Storms
forced people underground.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:47.882
Jorge says there's settlements
all over these tunnels.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.610
So, what about Jorge? Is he your father?

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.171
Close enough.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.207
Truth is, I don't really know what he is.
He's just always been there.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.728
And I've always done what he's asked
me to do, no matter how stupid.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.161
So you don't think
the Right Arm is real?

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.371
I think...

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.567
hope is a dangerous thing.

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:22.245
Hope has killed more of my friends
than the Flare and the Scorch combined.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.771
Just thought Jorge
was smarter than that.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.401
Damn.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.767
Hey, I think it might be this way.

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.761
Brenda?

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.126
Brenda?

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:09.250
I'm over here. Look at this.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.931
What? What is it?

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.322
What the hell is this?

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.808
I don't know.

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.126
Jesus.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.001
Go, go, go!

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.965
Oh, my God!

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.001
Come on!

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.166
Keep going!

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.050
We're almost there. Come on.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.045
Come on! This way!

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.086
Thomas! Come on!

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:41.641
Okay.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.164
- Go, go!
- Come on!

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.368
Keep going!

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.601
Watch out!

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.287
Are you okay?

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.250
Come on!

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.726
Follow me!

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.771
Yeah, I'm behind you.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.042
Go, go, go!

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.804
- Okay, go, go!
- Come on!

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:50.881
Brenda!

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:56.321
Brenda!

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.325
You okay?

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:00.640
Yeah.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.124
Hang on, I'm gonna find a way down.

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.802
No, Brenda, don't move. Don't move!

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.120
- Come on.
- I can't.

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.044
Brenda, grab my hand.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:38.891
No, no!

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.641
Thomas!

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.366
- Brenda!
- I can't reach!

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:55.767
Come on!

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:57.681
Brenda!

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.485
Got you.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.727
We can get down here. Come on.

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.930
Hey, you hear that?

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:38.606
You all right?

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.365
Shit.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.281
Brenda...

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:56.370
Yeah, yeah. I know.

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.041
Let's just go find Marcus.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:18.321
Okay.

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.323
Try to blend in.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.843
Are you sure this is the place?

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.524
You here for the party?

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.001
No.

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:10.042
We're looking for Marcus.
This is his place, isn't it?

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:12.407
This is my place.

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:19.249
Are you Marcus?

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.726
Marcus doesn't live here anymore.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.210
Do you know where we can find him?

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.524
Sure, sure. He's over in Zone B.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.041
Okay. What's Zone B?

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.248
It's where they burn the bodies.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.722
Okay, look, has anyone else been
by here...

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:41.644
looking for him?

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:43.802
Group of kids around our age?
They had a girl with them.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.610
Dark hair.

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:49.731
You know...
I think they might be inside.

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:51.761
Here.

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.484
Drink this.

01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.730
What is it?

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:02.482
The price of admission.

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:08.721
Drink it!

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:16.566
Your turn.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.525
All right.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.005
You two, enjoy the party.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.281
Maybe we should split up.

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:57.163
See if we can find the others.

01:23:58.920 --> 01:23:59.887
Hey.

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.288
Don't drink anything else.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:46.570
That was fun!

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:49.582
What?

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.645
Brenda?

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.567
They're not here.

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:09.482
Okay, well... we should keep looking.

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:11.881
Why?

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:14.410
We couldn't find the Right Arm anyway.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.567
Not without Marcus.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.247
Your friends are gone.

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:23.929
It's over.

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:25.841
It's just us now.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.089
Just try and relax.

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.685
Let go.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.325
How?

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.765
Like this.

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.450
What?

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.483
You're not her.

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.161
Brenda.

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.006
Thomas.

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:14.801
Hey.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:16.885
Hey. Did anyone see you come here?

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.320
No, what are you talking about?

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.686
We don't have a lot of time.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:20.881
Thomas, what's wrong?

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.644
I just had to see you...

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.604
and just try to explain things before...

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:28.207
- Oh, no.
- Thomas!

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.658
Just listen to me, okay?
Whatever they tell you about me,

01:27:30.778 --> 01:27:33.724
whatever they say,
I just need you to know I had to do it.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:35.281
Okay?

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:37.290
What did you do?

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:40.726
I just couldn't keep watching them die.

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:43.802
Over here! Come on.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.171
- No!
- I'm sorry.

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:47.322
Thomas!

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.522
Hey, you're okay.

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.381
Hi.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:57.121
We have to stop meeting like this.

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.364
Welcome back, you ugly shank.

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:10.811
I suggest that you talk!
You son of a bitch!

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.377
Damn it!

01:28:13.477 --> 01:28:16.886
I'm sorry, you're going
to have to leave my house.

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:19.768
Looks like you've been having fun.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.369
Listen. I don't enjoy hurting you.

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:25.446
Okay?

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:28.482
Where is the Right Arm, Marcus?

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.724
Wait, this is Marcus?

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:33.969
The kid catches on quick.

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.686
Are you the brains of the operation?

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:38.851
I know you know where they're hiding.

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:44.689
So you tell me,
and I'll make you a deal.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.368
You can come with us.

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:50.046
I burned that bridge a long time ago.

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.962
Besides, I made my own deal.

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:59.204
You're the one who taught me,
never miss an opportunity.

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.765
What's he talking about?

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:07.722
I'm talking about supply and demand.

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.601
WICKED wants all the Immunes
they can get.

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:12.965
I help provide that for them.

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.922
So I lure the kids in...

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.690
they get drunk, they have a good time.

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:21.128
And then, later, WICKED comes in...

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:25.363
they separate the wheat from the chaff.

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:31.445
I changed my mind, hermano.

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.803
I do enjoy hurting you.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.162
Talk! Talk!

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:44.845
Okay! Jesus!

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.923
But I'm not making any promises.

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:49.367
These guys like to move around.

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:57.408
They have an outpost in the mountains.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.729
But it's a long way away.

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:03.210
You got half of WICKED on your ass.
You're never gonna make it.

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.650
Not on foot.

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:12.050
Where's Bertha?

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:15.530
Not Bertha.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.804
Well, I guess we're on foot.

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.847
- Get down!
- Take cover!

01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:03.568
Hey, is everyone okay out there?

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:04.846
We're fine.

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.247
Anyone know where
those bloody shots came from?

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:11.047
That son of a bitch, Marcus.
He led us into an ambush.

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:24.450
What do we do?

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:25.801
Here.

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.530
Hold this.

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.887
We gotta create a diversion.

01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:32.485
You get ready to chuck it.

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:37.049
Everybody!

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:38.565
Get set to sprint back to the truck!

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.324
And hold your ears!

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.883
Ready? One...

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.201
Two...

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:47.801
Drop it.

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:52.321
Now!

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.322
I said drop it!

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:02.889
On your feet. Let's go.

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:06.411
Let's go! Move!

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.250
- Back up!
- Easy.

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.161
You two, over here now!

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:12.926
- Come on, let's go!
- Don't be stupid! Move.

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:15.851
Slowly.

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:20.847
Aris?

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:25.520
Oh, my God. Harriet?

01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:27.887
My God.
What the hell are you doing here?

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:32.682
Sonya.

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.127
Aris, you're lucky we didn't
shoot your dumb ass.

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.211
You all right, man?

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:38.361
How...?

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:39.885
What's happening?

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.884
We were in the maze together.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.566
We're clear, guys! Come on out!

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:50.370
Copy that! We're clear!

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.210
Stand down!

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.448
My God, you're alive.

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:05.926
Back it up, Joe!

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.411
Back it up!

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.564
We're taking them to base.

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.405
Wait, so, how did you guys get here?

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:21.163
- The Right Arm got us out.
- Wait.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.404
The Right Arm?
Do you know where they are?

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:28.921
Hop in.

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.202
They've been planning this
for over a year now.

01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:13.690
This is all for us.

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:15.683
You guys are lucky you found us
when you did.

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.842
We're moving out at first light.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.490
- Where's Vince?
- Somewhere over there, I think.

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:22.566
Who's Vince?

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:26.361
He's the one who decides
if you get to stay.

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.368
I thought the Right Arm
was supposed to be an army.

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:31.409
Yeah, we were.

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:34.728
This is all that's left of us.

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.646
Lot of good people died
getting us this far.

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:44.846
Who are they?

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.570
They're Immunes.

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:48.683
Caught 'em coming up the mountain.

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:50.845
Did you check 'em?

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:55.162
I know this guy, Aris. I trust him.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.844
Well, I don't. Check 'em.

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:00.771
Hey, boss...

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.164
Brenda! Brenda!

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:06.370
What's going on?

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:09.409
Brenda! Brenda.

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.848
- Brenda, talk to me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.206
What's going on with her?

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.522
I don't know. Brenda, are you all right?

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:19.045
- Brenda? Talk to me.
- What the hell?

01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:20.722
Shit!

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:22.126
- Crank! We got a Crank!
- No!

01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:23.770
- No!
- Wait, wait!

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.530
- Step back!
- Listen, okay?

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.523
This just happened, okay?
She's not dangerous yet.

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.882
- You shouldn't have brought her here!
- I know.

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.123
We let Cranks in here now,
the safe haven doesn't last a week!

01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:35.571
- Step back!
- I understand, okay? I understand.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:39.202
Just listen. Please. Please, okay?
I told her that you could help.

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:41.764
Okay? No.

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.964
There's got to be something you can do.

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:49.326
Yeah, there is.

01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:56.128
- I can put her out of her misery.
- No! No!

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.886
Vince, that's enough! Let him go.

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:01.325
Let him go!

01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:05.970
She's infected, Doc.
There's nothing we can do for her.

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.566
No, but he can.

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:12.810
Hello, Thomas.

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:16.287
What?

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.924
You know me?

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:22.441
Interesting.

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:26.641
It makes sense
they'd put you in the maze.

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.330
Though I must admit...

01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:32.485
I was worried they'd kill you
after what you did.

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:35.805
What I did?

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:42.600
The first time we spoke,
you said you couldn't take it anymore...

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.521
watching your friends die, one by one.

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.849
The last time we spoke...

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.800
you gave me the coordinates
of every WICKED compound, trial and lab.

01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:56.964
He was our source.

01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.886
We couldn't have pulled
all this off without him.

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:03.845
Take her to the tent.

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:06.482
Get these guys some warm clothes.

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:10.165
- Careful.
- Come on.

01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:17.206
Hey, it's the least we can do.

01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.808
Thomas, come on.

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:23.323
I need to get some blood from you.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.926
In the beginning, we were lost.

01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:36.167
All we knew for sure...

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:39.722
was that the younger you were,
the stronger your chances.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.210
You worked for WICKED?

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:46.688
Long time ago.

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:49.681
You know, at first,
we had the best intentions.

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:52.681
Find a cure, save the world.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.686
It was clear you kids were the key,
because you were immune.

01:38:58.520 --> 01:38:59.851
But why?

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:02.288
Eventually, we found an answer.

01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:05.525
An enzyme produced
by the brains of the immune.

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:07.091
Once separated from the bloodstream...

01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:10.687
it can serve as a powerful agent
to slow the spread of the virus.

01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:13.927
So, you found a cure?

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:15.805
Not exactly.

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:21.609
The enzyme can't be manufactured,
only harvested from the immune.

01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:23.600
The young.

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.727
Of course, that didn't stop WICKED.

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:28.927
If they had their way...

01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:31.970
they'd sacrifice an entire generation.

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.805
All for this.

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:37.251
A gift of biology.

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.084
Of evolution.

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:43.087
But one not meant for all of us.

01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:02.130
How long will that give her?

01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.851
It's different for everyone.
A few months maybe.

01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:08.242
But that's the catch, isn't it?

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:10.845
She'll always need more.

01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:13.966
Okay.

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.046
Let's go outside. Let them rest.

01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:18.761
Let's go.

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:21.925
She'll be fine.

01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:32.862
Thomas.

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:36.564
You know she can't come with us, right?

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:35.890
He was my brother.

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.568
Hey. Sorry.

01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:41.722
Are you okay? How are you feeling?

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:47.488
You remind me of him.

01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:52.691
He always saw the best in people.

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:56.090
Where is he now?

01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:05.249
I don't know.

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.168
When we were kids...

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:12.085
we were taken in
by one of WICKED's camps.

01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:17.568
They gave us a bunch of tests.

01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:21.049
They didn't want me.

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.250
They wanted him, though.

01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:34.163
They didn't even let me say good-bye.

01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.524
What was his name?

01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.249
George.

01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:05.571
That was Chuck.

01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:14.361
How did he die?

01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:21.130
Saving my life.

01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:36.971
Get some rest.

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:46.130
Hermano.

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:53.323
If anything were to happen to her, I...

01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:55.482
I know, I know.

01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:57.843
You should get in there. Go talk to her.

01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:04.203
I guess I owe you, now.

01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:19.043
So we broke out. I'm telling the truth.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.648
I wish Alby could've seen all this.

01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:35.965
And Winston.

01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:41.286
And Chuck.

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:45.928
He'd be proud of you, you know, Tommy.

01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:48.246
Yeah.

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:53.211
Hey, Aris!

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:55.531
Hey, guys!

01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.364
I kinda like that kid.

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:02.809
Yeah. I still don't trust him, though.

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:11.448
Hey, where's Teresa?

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:13.170
She went up there.

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:32.401
Hey, you okay?

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:34.767
What are you doing up here?

01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:37.930
Just thinking.

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:43.730
All right, I'll let you be alone.

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:49.203
Do you remember your mother?

01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:58.931
I think so.

01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:02.570
I remember mine.

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:07.122
She was a beautiful woman.

01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:09.609
Everybody loved her.

01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:13.441
And before WICKED, she was all I had.

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:22.689
When she got sick,
I didn't know what to do.

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:27.324
I just kept her locked up. Hidden.

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:30.523
I thought she'd get better.

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.807
Every night, she'd make
these awful sounds, like screaming.

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:42.322
And then, one night, she just stopped.

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:45.330
She was finally quiet.

01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:50.004
I went down to her room.

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:54.564
And there was blood everywhere.

01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:58.122
But she was just sat there, calm.

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:00.850
She said she was feeling better.

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:04.491
The visions were gone.
She'd taken care of them.

01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:09.884
She took her eyes out, Thomas.

01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:16.361
There are millions of people
suffering out there.

01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:18.966
Millions of stories, just like mine.

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:25.161
We can't turn our backs on them.

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.925
I won't.

01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.571
What are you saying?

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:37.691
I'm saying, I want you to understand.

01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:41.050
Understand what?

01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:44.291
Why I did it.

01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:57.126
Teresa...

01:47:57.800 --> 01:47:59.962
Please don't fight them, Thomas.

01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:02.771
What have you done?

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.929
What have you done?

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:28.289
No!

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.485
All right, drop in, boys. Round 'em up.

01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:09.051
Go, go!

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:12.281
Take 'em out!

01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:17.440
Tyson!

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:21.084
- Stop!
- Don't move!

01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:24.011
Where's Thomas?

01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:27.648
Harriet! Ammo!

01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:30.486
Vince! Harriet!

01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:32.085
- Come on!
- Over here!

01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:35.089
- How can we help?
- You need to cover us!

01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:37.291
Ammo!

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:40.047
Hey! Do you know how to use this thing?

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:41.201
Cover me!

01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:43.169
This fifty's our only chance!

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:55.201
Brenda!

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:03.882
- You dumbass.
- Come on!

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:06.768
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:10.282
We gotta take cover!

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:12.727
We have to go.
Now, while we still have the chance.

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:16.686
- I gotta go find the others.
- No! Look! Look.

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:18.769
You can't help them.

01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:25.949
Vince, hurry up!
There's too many of them.

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:32.829
I'm out!

01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:37.642
- Look out!
- Shit!

01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:47.720
All right, take me down.

01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:53.402
Shit. Shit.

01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:57.245
I'm sorry.

01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:59.410
There's just nothing
you can do for them.

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:03.610
If we don't move now,
we won't be much better off.

01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:09.402
- You guys gotta go right now.
- What?

01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:12.171
They're not looking for you.
You'll be safe, but you have to go now.

01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:13.926
Thomas...

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:20.489
I can't leave without them.

01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:24.281
Go.

01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:27.611
Good luck, kid.

01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:31.968
Bren, we have to go. Come on. Come on.

01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:34.364
Let's go, come on. Come on!

01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:02.827
Let's go, let's go!

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:10.048
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:17.886
Line them up right here! On their knees!
Put some eyes up on that ridge.

01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:20.926
B-4.

01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:23.481
How many did we get?

01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:25.244
All of them. Give or take.

01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:26.447
Give or take what?

01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:28.170
Well, they lost a few.

01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:32.171
A-4.

01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:36.161
A-6.

01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:42.161
B-3.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.764
Where's Thomas?

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:46.649
Right here.

01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:48.686
Freeze!

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:52.269
Go!

01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:58.641
Thomas.

01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:02.965
Get him in line.

01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:11.367
Okay.

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.360
Bring her in.

01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:20.724
Why didn't you run?

01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:26.409
I'm tired of running.

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.241
Is this all of them?

01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:27.890
Most of them.

01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:29.801
It'll be enough.

01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:31.361
Start loading them in.

01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:32.681
Yes, ma'am.

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:34.120
Okay, you heard. Let's go!

01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:35.361
Get 'em on!

01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:46.804
Hello, Thomas.

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.288
I'm glad you're safe.

01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:58.241
What the hell?

01:54:58.800 --> 01:54:59.801
Teresa?

01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:01.770
Wait, what's going on?

01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:03.561
She's with them.

01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:06.801
Since when?

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:11.244
Teresa's always had an evolved
appreciation of the greater good.

01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:16.167
Once we restored her memories,
it was only a matter of time.

01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:21.121
Let's go, let's go.

01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:22.611
I'm sorry.

01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:26.963
I had no choice. This is the only way.

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:29.441
We have to find a cure.

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:32.843
She's right.
This is all just a means to an end.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.968
You used to understand that, Thomas.

01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:37.329
No matter what you think of me...

01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:39.448
I am not a monster. I'm a doctor.

01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:42.206
I swore an oath to find a cure!

01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:44.046
No matter the cost.

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:50.047
I just need more time.

01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:52.484
More blood.

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:57.365
Hello, Mary.

01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:59.888
I hoped we'd meet again.

01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:02.042
I'm sorry it had to be
under these circumstances.

01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:06.890
I'm sorry about a lot of things, too.
But not this.

01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:10.641
At least my conscience is clear.

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:14.404
So is mine.

01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:21.568
Mary? Mary? Mary!

01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:25.887
Mary! Mary!

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:28.245
Get off me!

01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:31.408
Mary? Mary? Mary?

01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:34.486
Mary?

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:36.766
No!

01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:40.327
Mary! No!

01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:42.566
Come on, Janson.

01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:44.524
Load them up. Let's go.

01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:47.166
All these people. Get rid of them.

01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:48.765
Let's go. Let's go!

01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:51.041
- Let go of me!
- Sonya! Aris!

01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:55.601
Get back! Everyone, stand back!

01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:58.003
- Stand back!
- Hold your fire!

01:56:58.160 --> 01:56:59.525
- Everyone, stand back!
- Hold your fire!

01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:02.366
- Stand back. Let 'em go.
- Thomas, put it down.

01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:04.648
- Let 'em all go!
- You know I can't do that!

01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:06.290
Thomas, please stop.

01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:09.967
I made a deal with them.
They promised we'd be safe. All of us.

01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:11.531
And I'm supposed to trust you now?

01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:13.762
It's true. It was her only condition.

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.041
Shut up!

01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:17.442
Everything can go back
to the way it was.

01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:19.361
Thomas...

01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:21.850
do you really want all of them to die?

01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:26.011
Listen to her, Thomas.
Think about what you're doing.

01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:37.728
We're with you, Thomas.

01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:39.806
No.

01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:41.521
Don't.

01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:43.650
- Do it, Thomas.
- We're ready.

01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:48.361
- We're not going back there.
- Thomas?

01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:50.804
It's the only way.

01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.007
Thomas!

01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:18.042
- Come on. Come on!
- Get her out of here!

01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:20.580
You good?

01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:22.569
Freeze! Drop it, kid!

01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:26.210
Run! Get down!

01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:37.526
Freeze!

01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:48.006
What a waste.

01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:05.882
Vince, go!

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:08.326
Now!

01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:22.731
Keep going. I got you.

01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:32.887
Get outta here! Go! Go!

01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:35.845
Come on, Thomas! Get outta here!

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.001
Minho, let's go!

01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:38.321
Get out of here! Go!

01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:40.921
Get down!

01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:48.882
Minho!

01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:54.769
Minho!

01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:00.927
- Thomas, get back!
- No! Thomas, no!

02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:02.668
Minho!

02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:05.403
Thomas!

02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:08.801
Minho!

02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:10.885
Go! Come on!

02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:13.247
Minho!

02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:37.569
What do we do now?

02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:43.087
Well, we pick up what's left of us.

02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:45.441
We stick to the plan.

02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:47.762
We get you kids to the safe haven.

02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:58.841
Then we start over, I guess.

02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:08.444
I'm not going with you.

02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:12.481
What?

02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:16.321
I made a promise to Minho.

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:19.008
I wouldn't leave him behind.
I have to go after him.

02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:23.370
Hey, kid, look around you.

02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:26.040
All right? WICKED just kicked our ass.

02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:30.647
You think about where you're headed.

02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:33.811
I'm not asking anyone to come with me.

02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:36.485
Thomas, listen to me.

02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:42.565
I've known Minho for...
Well, as long as I can remember.

02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:46.600
So, if there was any way
that we could help him...

02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:49.445
trust me, I would be up
there standing next to you.

02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:51.841
This, what you're talking about...

02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:54.284
is impossible.

02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:57.962
More like suicide.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.126
Maybe.

02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:05.721
But I know what I'm supposed to do now.

02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:12.125
It's not just about Minho.
It's about all of us.

02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:15.722
It's about everyone WICKED's ever taken,
everyone they will take.

02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:19.051
They'll never stop.

02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:25.483
They'll never stop,
so I'm gonna stop them.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.685
I'm gonna kill Ava Paige.

02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:37.165
I have to admit...

02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:41.402
I'd like some revenge.

02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:48.921
Well, that's a good speech, kid.

02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:52.404
So, what's your plan?
