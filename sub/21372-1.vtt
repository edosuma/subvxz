01:42.315 --> 01:45.062
Hey, Eric. Massive party
happening tonight, yeah?

01:45.187 --> 01:46.102
- Can't miss it.
- Great.

01:46.186 --> 01:47.434
Don't forget
to bring some beers, man.

01:47.559 --> 01:48.516
-Sure.
-Cheers, mate.

01:49.099 --> 01:52.055
Just a bit. Just a bit, OK.

01:54.510 --> 01:56.550
Really, really nice. One more time.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.777
Hey, man. Do you want a drink?

02:19.985 --> 02:21.441
Oh, my God, seriously?

02:21.566 --> 02:23.981
Hey, man you made it.
Have a drink with us, yeah?

03:00.112 --> 03:00.944
Hello?

03:02.359 --> 03:05.075
- Hello? Is anyone around?
- Yeah.

03:05.856 --> 03:09.643
Hi. Can you come and help me, please?
I'm kinda stuck.

03:10.767 --> 03:11.850
Yeah.

03:13.182 --> 03:14.347
Thank you.

03:18.801 --> 03:19.925
Um...

03:20.300 --> 03:22.672
Yeah, I'm higher than I thought
I was gonna be.

03:22.797 --> 03:25.045
Do you think you can help me down, please?

03:27.750 --> 03:30.331
Hello. How are you?

03:31.413 --> 03:32.912
I'm fine.

03:33.328 --> 03:34.952
Yeah, good.

03:35.118 --> 03:37.003
Do you think you can help me down, please?

03:37.615 --> 03:39.738
-Yeah...
-Thank you.

03:39.863 --> 03:41.486
What do you want me to do?

03:41.695 --> 03:42.819
Um... I don't...

03:43.110 --> 03:45.399
Hey, what are you looking at?

03:47.439 --> 03:49.353
No, I'm joking. It's fine. It's fine.

03:50.270 --> 03:52.642
-Fine.
-Right, how do you want to do it?

03:54.141 --> 03:56.471
-If you could just move your leg...
-Where, I...

04:04.297 --> 04:06.295
Listen, you have to wait your turn.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.293
But you have to take care of him now.

04:08.459 --> 04:11.415
Come on. Look at him.
His nose is bigger than his face.

04:19.781 --> 04:22.155
Why don't you just go back to the party?

04:23.819 --> 04:25.027
What? And leave you like this?

04:29.605 --> 04:31.603
So you're a musician.

04:32.020 --> 04:34.517
I heard you playing
before I jumped out the window.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.844
It was really good.

04:38.721 --> 04:40.999
-Do you play anywhere?
-Yeah, in class.

04:41.510 --> 04:44.965
I mean, like, in a real place
where people can hear you.

04:48.431 --> 04:49.910
Come on, Eric. I said I was sorry.

04:50.917 --> 04:52.247
Don't make me feel worse.

04:54.622 --> 04:56.745
We might have to spend
the whole night here.

04:56.870 --> 04:58.368
Or you could just leave.

05:09.149 --> 05:10.289
Are you gonna pass out?

05:16.101 --> 05:16.933
No.

05:18.514 --> 05:21.345
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

05:22.635 --> 05:23.801
OK.

05:52.897 --> 05:54.562
- Be careful.
- Do you trust me, man?

05:54.687 --> 05:56.226
On the count of three.

05:56.351 --> 05:58.724
One, two...

06:06.175 --> 06:09.463
-How does it look?
-Nasty... but sexy.

06:13.876 --> 06:16.748
So, man, you said you were
gonna tell me about this girl.

06:18.538 --> 06:19.870
There's not really much to say.

06:20.411 --> 06:23.199
I mean, she doesn't live here,
she just broke in.

06:23.658 --> 06:26.446
-She's crazy.
-Oh, yeah. I know that type of woman.

06:27.195 --> 06:28.528
I bet you do.

06:29.485 --> 06:33.648
But did you manage to, you know,
get in there?

06:34.355 --> 06:37.435
-We're at a hospital. I was cut.
-Yeah, that's true.

06:40.141 --> 06:44.428
To be honest... I think I might
have been a bit mean to her.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.301
Oh, that's good.

06:46.926 --> 06:48.383
No, not like...

06:54.502 --> 06:55.834
Is that her?

06:57.332 --> 06:59.788
Don't say anything. Don't say anything.

06:59.955 --> 07:02.702
She's gorgeous, man.
You never told me she was hot.

07:02.827 --> 07:04.200
Yeah, I know she's pretty.

07:04.325 --> 07:07.114
Please, I have to do this.
I've got to get this done.

07:07.239 --> 07:08.821
I haven't got time for this.

07:09.445 --> 07:10.652
Jason!

07:11.151 --> 07:12.817
Hey! Hey, girl!

07:12.942 --> 07:15.231
-Guys, this is the fucking library.
-Here's Eric.

07:18.269 --> 07:19.727
She's coming.

07:20.309 --> 07:24.430
-Hey, how are you?
-Fine, thanks.

07:24.555 --> 07:26.636
-How's your nose? Is it... Sorry.
-Don't.

07:26.803 --> 07:28.801
-Don't touch it. It really hurts.
-Does it?

07:29.217 --> 07:32.464
-It's much better now, isn't it, Eric?
-Yeah, it looks a lot better.

07:32.630 --> 07:34.670
-I'm Jason.
-Hi. I'm Jo.

07:35.003 --> 07:36.743
-Hello, Jo.
-Nice to meet you.

07:37.209 --> 07:39.832
-How's it going?
-Nice to meet you too. It's going good.

07:39.957 --> 07:42.495
-What are you doing here?
-We're going to the pub tonight.

07:42.620 --> 07:43.994
There's a jam session on.

07:44.118 --> 07:45.826
-What, now?
-Yeah, now.

07:46.700 --> 07:50.487
-Come on, Eric. It's gonna be fun.
-No, I got... Sorry.

07:50.612 --> 07:53.693
Eric. You need to sing for this girl.

07:53.818 --> 07:55.816
I'm definitely not gonna play, no.

07:55.941 --> 07:57.647
Well, Jason says we're going.

07:57.772 --> 07:59.770
Yeah, Jason says we've got to go.

08:00.894 --> 08:02.475
Don't I get a say in this?

08:03.558 --> 08:05.056
Come on, guys, let's go.

08:05.222 --> 08:07.845
- The Stones?
- No, it's overdone.

08:08.219 --> 08:10.384
- Eric Clapton.
- Too hard.

08:11.841 --> 08:14.547
-Dylan?
-You can't play Dylan here.

08:15.421 --> 08:17.835
All right. Maybe not.

08:18.543 --> 08:21.498
-Guys, come on. Let's go.
-Come on, Eric. Let's go.

08:39.897 --> 08:42.519
-She speaks French?
-Yes.

08:45.891 --> 08:49.678
-I'm sorry, man. there's no space tonight.
-No. It's all right.

08:49.803 --> 08:51.760
I didn't know there was gonna be
so many people.

08:51.885 --> 08:53.633
- Jo?
- Hey!

08:53.966 --> 08:55.464
Give me a second. I'll be right back.

08:55.589 --> 08:58.169
-I've got to go, really.
-No, no, no. Don't go.

08:58.961 --> 09:02.082
Let me get you a drink.
Just one drink, OK?

09:02.332 --> 09:05.037
I'm paying. And get me a beer as well.

09:09.283 --> 09:12.030
Oh, thanks, Jay. I'd love a drink.
Cheers, nice one.

09:12.197 --> 09:13.654
What? She's paying.

09:24.185 --> 09:26.266
-You seen Jo?
-No.

09:28.348 --> 09:31.803
It's a bit rude, isn't it?
Dragging us here and then bailing.

09:32.927 --> 09:34.592
Weren't we supposed to relax?

09:39.587 --> 09:41.876
I'm gonna go find her
and tell her I'm leaving.

10:10.264 --> 10:12.179
I'll give you my number.
You can call me afterwards.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.010
Maybe. Who knows?

10:14.510 --> 10:15.842
I'm off, man.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.840
Did you manage to find her?

10:18.548 --> 10:21.336
No, she'll work it out. You coming?

10:23.334 --> 10:24.542
Yeah.

10:25.582 --> 10:28.621
I'm really sorry
to interrupt your evening, everyone.

10:28.788 --> 10:32.242
But we have an amazing musician
here tonight.

10:32.534 --> 10:34.823
And he's a really good friend
of mine as well.

10:34.947 --> 10:38.819
I think it would be a real shame if we all
went home and we didn't hear him play.

10:38.985 --> 10:42.399
So can we please have a huge
round of applause for Eric.

10:42.524 --> 10:44.313
Come on. Please come on stage.

10:44.438 --> 10:46.353
Man, you got to go. This is your chance.

10:47.144 --> 10:47.976
Yeah!

10:48.059 --> 10:49.974
Come on, Eric.

10:50.807 --> 10:52.014
Watch it.

10:52.347 --> 10:53.179
Come on.

10:54.512 --> 10:56.010
Come on, get up.

10:56.843 --> 10:59.007
-I'm gonna kill you.
-Good luck.

14:24.343 --> 14:25.841
-It's horrible...
-Yeah.

14:26.882 --> 14:28.631
You have to learn to like it.

14:29.837 --> 14:31.586
-I think I'm OK.
-Yeah?

14:35.249 --> 14:36.747
Who's that guy?

14:37.788 --> 14:40.077
Jimmy? He's a friend.

14:40.619 --> 14:42.824
I saw you give him a present earlier.

14:42.991 --> 14:44.615
-Yeah, did you see it?
-A sign.

14:44.781 --> 14:47.404
I made it with the planks of wood
I took the other day.

14:48.028 --> 14:50.941
I like to recycle things.
Give them a new life.

14:52.274 --> 14:54.979
-It was kind of stupid.
-No, that was really good.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.518
Do you ever write your own songs?

14:58.975 --> 15:01.098
-I've never written one.
-Never?

15:01.431 --> 15:03.637
That's the first thing I'd do
if I could play.

15:03.762 --> 15:05.261
-I'd write my own songs.
-Yeah.

15:06.010 --> 15:08.091
It's really, really, really difficult.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.123
That is how it's done!

15:19.038 --> 15:22.035
-Oi, Queen Bee!
-J, you slut!

15:24.616 --> 15:25.948
Come here.

15:26.365 --> 15:28.113
-Guess who I saw the other day?
-Who?

15:28.238 --> 15:30.194
-Danny Zuko.
-No!

15:30.651 --> 15:32.608
-What was his real name?
-You should know.

15:32.816 --> 15:35.314
-Anyway, he's coming to Burning Man.
-No.

15:35.522 --> 15:37.894
-You didn't tell him I'm going, did you?
-Maybe.

15:38.061 --> 15:40.559
-Oh, you slut!
-Come on!

15:41.974 --> 15:43.431
Burning Man? What's that?

15:43.556 --> 15:45.346
Burning Man.
It's, like, a festival in Nevada.

15:45.429 --> 15:47.177
Like, In the desert.
In the middle of nowhere...

15:47.385 --> 15:51.215
- I can't wait to go with you. Finally!
- Yeah!

15:51.340 --> 15:53.753
- It's our summer!
- I know! It's so good!

15:53.878 --> 15:56.335
There's no money as well,
just exchange everything,

15:56.460 --> 15:57.791
you have to bring your own food.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.123
-And Alex is coming.
-I know.

15:59.207 --> 16:02.204
- Alex is going?
- Of course he is.

16:02.953 --> 16:06.075
- He's a god.
- Stop drinking, Mary.

16:06.865 --> 16:09.987
Do you like it? The tattoo?

16:11.361 --> 16:13.151
Different tastes, I guess.

16:16.190 --> 16:17.938
I don't think so.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.476
Come on, guys, let's get out of here.
This place is dead.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.391
Let's go, we're going. Come on.

16:23.557 --> 16:25.264
- Come on.
- Guess I'm driving.

16:25.389 --> 16:26.762
- Let's go.
- Come on.

16:27.844 --> 16:30.591
Come on. I'm not taking no for an answer.

16:34.338 --> 16:36.378
I'm gonna go. Sorry.

16:39.167 --> 16:40.457
Come on, let's go.

16:41.456 --> 16:42.746
Nice to see you.

16:44.412 --> 16:47.866
-Wait, can I get your number?
-I don't have a number.

16:48.698 --> 16:50.031
Maybe I could...

16:51.196 --> 16:53.069
come with you.

17:34.028 --> 17:38.191
So you remember from last week
that we were talking about romance.

17:38.399 --> 17:40.480
We were talking about the classics.

17:40.605 --> 17:43.019
We were talking about
the great Western tradition

17:43.852 --> 17:49.180
that all cumulated and have led
to our friend, Ludwig van Beethoven.

17:49.305 --> 17:51.760
Born in Bonn. Anyone remember when?

17:52.634 --> 17:53.925
Check it for next week.

17:54.383 --> 17:57.130
Ludwig van Beethoven, born in Bonn,

17:57.297 --> 18:00.751
had really became Beethoven in Vienna.

18:01.251 --> 18:03.166
But there's something
I want to talk to you about today

18:03.291 --> 18:06.121
which is about time signature
we haven't really touched on.

18:07.245 --> 18:10.491
I really wanna talk about the folk music
of that time.

18:10.783 --> 18:13.239
The 19th century, the 18th century.

18:13.572 --> 18:16.361
-What are you doing here?
-I have something for you.

18:16.527 --> 18:18.151
-What?
-I...

18:22.896 --> 18:24.312
I have something for you.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.060
-What, now?
-Yes, now.

18:26.809 --> 18:28.099
Look.

18:30.763 --> 18:33.468
I made it. Do you like it?

18:34.218 --> 18:35.051
Wow.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.174
I carved into it,

18:37.340 --> 18:40.129
and then I burnt the inside
to make the dark come out.

18:41.835 --> 18:42.876
It's amazing.

18:43.001 --> 18:44.707
-Do you like it?
-Yeah, I love it.

18:45.956 --> 18:48.703
You were right.
I think it's what I want to do.

18:49.494 --> 18:51.450
-What? Make guitar picks?
-No.

18:52.367 --> 18:53.823
Stuff with wood.

18:54.531 --> 18:56.113
I think I could be good at it.

18:58.985 --> 18:59.817
Yeah.

19:01.524 --> 19:03.023
You have class?

19:05.312 --> 19:06.394
Yeah.

19:10.057 --> 19:13.845
No. Stop it. Go away.

19:18.382 --> 19:20.630
- You have class?
- At that time there was an empire.

19:24.709 --> 19:29.205
And there you had influences
coming from what is now Turkey...

20:03.462 --> 20:06.417
Hey, this is just sex, OK?

20:07.916 --> 20:11.163
-OK, friend.
-You're so sweet.

20:11.620 --> 20:12.453
Hey!

20:14.784 --> 20:16.324
I'm not sweet.

20:54.952 --> 20:57.159
<i> Burning Man, it's like a festival</i>
<i>in the middle of the desert.</i>

20:57.283 --> 21:01.238
Like, you accept everyone
and you're just free of expressing...

21:01.404 --> 21:03.985
-How hippy of you.
-Yeah, but, no, it's beautiful.

21:04.152 --> 21:06.482
That's the problem with our society.

21:06.607 --> 21:11.061
For the day, you can just go naked
but I'm gonna put nipple covers, I think.

21:11.186 --> 21:15.890
There is shitloads of sandstorms,
like dust, and it's like...

21:15.973 --> 21:17.679
then you put the goggle like this.

21:24.256 --> 21:26.754
Eric? Eric! Shh.

21:40.948 --> 21:43.862
- Gold mine.
- Wow. Look at that!

21:45.152 --> 21:46.400
You like?

21:48.357 --> 21:49.564
<i>Come out.</i>

21:53.768 --> 21:55.266
Eric, run!

22:02.634 --> 22:04.257
And then back to E minor.

22:41.845 --> 22:43.510
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:44.967 --> 22:46.331
Did you stay here?

22:46.799 --> 22:49.288
I found a wood-working course.
It starts next week.

22:50.004 --> 22:51.047
It's in London.

22:52.793 --> 22:54.263
I'm not going to Burning Man.

23:06.279 --> 23:07.944
<i> She's not going to Burning Man?</i>

23:08.360 --> 23:10.691
Woah! She's not going to Burning Man
because of you?

23:12.564 --> 23:13.397
What?

23:14.604 --> 23:15.502
Eric.

23:18.767 --> 23:20.537
I'm going to play the song for Jo tonight.

23:21.722 --> 23:23.803
You're going to play it tonight?

23:25.635 --> 23:28.298
<i> Isn't it a bit too soon?</i>

23:29.631 --> 23:31.295
<i>It's fine, man.</i>

23:32.211 --> 23:33.044
What's up?

23:34.542 --> 23:36.374
Hey, you ready?

23:41.036 --> 23:43.408
<i>Hi, everybody. Good evening.</i>

23:44.366 --> 23:45.698
<i>How are you?</i>

23:48.278 --> 23:51.484
Hey. What are you doing here?

23:52.691 --> 23:53.940
I'm playing.

23:54.897 --> 23:56.229
Playing what?

23:57.644 --> 23:59.392
A song I wrote for Jo.

24:00.266 --> 24:01.390
For Jo?

24:02.389 --> 24:05.636
-Don't tell her.
-I won't. She's gonna love it.

24:10.631 --> 24:12.421
All right. You're up in five minutes.

24:13.628 --> 24:14.669
OK.

24:14.961 --> 24:16.250
Better be good.

24:16.709 --> 24:18.041
Five minutes.

24:21.454 --> 24:23.118
Alex is here, guys.

24:32.818 --> 24:34.899
- Good to see you!
- How's it going?

24:35.940 --> 24:37.771
-Argh!
-Argh!

24:38.478 --> 24:39.311
Friendship.

24:39.602 --> 24:40.435
Argh!

24:41.059 --> 24:42.599
He's a handsome boy, right?

24:45.096 --> 24:46.470
He's the ex.

24:48.885 --> 24:50.758
-How's it going?
-Good, I'm really good.

24:50.883 --> 24:52.131
-How are you?
-Good.

24:52.298 --> 24:53.672
You're looking good, man.

24:54.671 --> 24:55.503
Hey!

24:57.209 --> 24:59.249
-You left me alone in London.
-You left me!

24:59.416 --> 25:01.872
Jo. I've got to go on stage.

25:01.997 --> 25:03.787
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

25:06.117 --> 25:07.991
-I'm Alex, man.
-Eric.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.044
Eric, you coming to Burning Man with us?

25:16.024 --> 25:17.106
No.

25:18.813 --> 25:21.394
-Give me a few seconds, OK?
-Yeah.

25:21.519 --> 25:23.642
I'm coming. I'm coming.

25:24.349 --> 25:25.931
Yeah, OK.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.921
-Jo. Are you OK?
-Yeah, I'm good.

25:38.752 --> 25:40.375
-You coming?
-Wait, wait, wait.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.248
You're not coming to Burning Man?

25:43.830 --> 25:45.411
Don't kill me, P.

25:46.702 --> 25:49.990
There you are. I've been looking for you.
Come on, you're up next.

25:50.198 --> 25:51.405
Go, go.

26:01.270 --> 26:03.393
Thank you. Thank you very much.

26:06.599 --> 26:07.931
All right, dude, you're on.

26:08.055 --> 26:10.095
Actually I need a minute.
I'm waiting for someone.

26:10.261 --> 26:11.677
I don't fucking care.
Get on the fucking stage.

26:11.760 --> 26:12.967
Just a second, please.

26:13.092 --> 26:14.882
Go, go, go, damn it!

26:25.496 --> 26:26.579
Fucking little...

26:38.982 --> 26:40.440
It's Eric. I'm looking for Jo.

26:40.690 --> 26:41.855
<i>Sorry?</i>

26:42.313 --> 26:44.894
It's Eric. I'm trying to reach Jo.

26:46.559 --> 26:48.098
<i>Yeah, what do you want?</i>

26:48.598 --> 26:50.763
Do you know
how I can get in touch with her?

26:50.888 --> 26:54.176
<i>Let it go, man. She'll reach you </i>
<i>when she comes back, OK?</i>

26:55.175 --> 26:57.298
Do you have her friend's number
or something like that?

26:57.464 --> 27:01.335
<i>They're in the fucking desert, mate.</i>
<i>Please just stop calling, all right?</i>

27:04.249 --> 27:05.665
Eric? Eric, man.

27:05.831 --> 27:07.371
Eric? Eric, dude.

27:07.995 --> 27:10.035
We're having lunch. You want to join us?

27:10.368 --> 27:13.032
I'm busy, man. I got practice.
I'm really behind.

27:13.198 --> 27:15.238
-What do you mean you're busy?
-Sorry.

27:15.987 --> 27:17.403
She's crazy, man.

28:26.250 --> 28:29.497
Thank you. OK.

29:20.655 --> 29:21.556
Excuse me.

29:22.902 --> 29:24.653
Do you know how I get to Black Rock City?

29:38.619 --> 29:40.357
WELCOME TO RENO

30:04.069 --> 30:05.360
We need to go downtown.

30:05.984 --> 30:07.940
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

30:08.065 --> 30:11.306
What? It is your obligation
to take passengers.

30:15.807 --> 30:16.760
My obligation?

30:18.138 --> 30:22.475
You should walk everywhere
until all that extra fat has burned away.

30:24.091 --> 30:26.047
Fuck you, you stupid son of a bitch!

30:38.160 --> 30:41.324
-What do you want?
-I need to go to Black Rock City.

30:41.781 --> 30:44.196
What is it that all the morons
have to come to me?

30:44.321 --> 30:46.069
-Look, kid, I'm off duty.
-All right.

30:47.359 --> 30:48.191
Sorry.

30:54.644 --> 30:55.725
Hey, kid.

30:57.433 --> 30:59.472
Those are the Creedence. Do you know them?

30:59.639 --> 31:01.387
-Yeah. Of course.
-How come?

31:02.927 --> 31:05.258
My dad used to play the records
when I was a kid.

31:05.508 --> 31:09.462
-You play?
-Guitar, and I sing.

31:10.710 --> 31:12.418
So where is your guitar, then?

31:14.124 --> 31:16.497
It was either come here or the guitar.

31:20.326 --> 31:22.823
Come here. Kid, come here.

31:25.030 --> 31:27.611
So where did you say you were going?

31:29.067 --> 31:30.233
Black Rock City.

31:32.231 --> 31:35.644
-Do you have any dope?
-No.

31:35.810 --> 31:38.058
What a shame. OK, hop in.

31:38.517 --> 31:40.306
-Are you taking me?
-Of course, kid.

31:40.847 --> 31:42.554
-You got money, haven't you?
-Yeah.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.676
OK! Well, jump in.

31:57.081 --> 31:58.538
-Seatbelt?
-Broken.

31:58.662 --> 32:00.994
But don't worry.
I haven't been smoking too much.

32:03.575 --> 32:08.403
-What about the taximeter?
-Kid, the taximeter is here.

32:30.090 --> 32:33.503
<i>♪ Some folks are born</i>
<i>Made to wave the flag ♪</i>

32:33.836 --> 32:36.000
<i>♪ Ooh, they're red, white and blue ♪</i>

32:37.333 --> 32:40.662
<i>♪ And when the band plays </i>
<i>"Hail to the Chief" ♪</i>

32:41.079 --> 32:43.784
<i>♪ Ooh, they point</i>
<i>The cannon at you, Lord ♪</i>

32:44.741 --> 32:47.988
<i>♪ It ain't me, it ain't me ♪</i>

32:48.113 --> 32:51.194
<i>♪ I ain't no fortunate one, no ♪</i>

32:51.818 --> 32:54.981
<i>♪ It ain't me, it ain't me ♪</i>

32:55.356 --> 32:58.187

33:12.464 --> 33:13.712
<i>♪ Lola! ♪</i>

33:13.879 --> 33:16.294
That's two.
And "Lola" is about a transvestite.

33:16.419 --> 33:19.457
But it's about a girl, ain't it?
Don't be such a prude about it.

33:19.540 --> 33:24.701
What I'm saying is, all the good bands
have a song about a woman.

33:25.659 --> 33:28.739
"Martha My Dear" is about McCartney's
old English sheepdog.

33:28.864 --> 33:30.446
All right, a woman's name then.

33:30.570 --> 33:33.859
But it's not about a "she" or a "baby".

33:33.984 --> 33:36.274
It's about them.

33:39.104 --> 33:42.558
So how many girls do you have to meet
before you become a good musician?

33:54.755 --> 33:57.461
So is the song you wrote about her
really that bad?

33:58.460 --> 34:00.915
It's just not really my thing.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.787
I think I'd rather play something
someone else wrote.

34:03.912 --> 34:07.825
You only say that because she took off
and you're screwed,

34:07.950 --> 34:10.239
but seriously, get serious about it.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.612
Keep practicing.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.693
You should go to Nashville.

34:14.818 --> 34:17.358
No better place
for a fella and his guitar.

34:19.022 --> 34:21.103
I just wanna go home with her.

34:25.225 --> 34:26.556
Woah! Woah!

34:30.053 --> 34:32.882
What the fuck are you talking about?

34:35.755 --> 34:36.588
Um...

34:37.712 --> 34:41.958
My girlfriend is there.
I'm gonna go find her.

34:46.869 --> 34:48.848
Your girl, she's probably...

34:53.405 --> 34:55.070
above and beyond.

35:01.438 --> 35:03.811
I don't know what you mean.
Above and beyond what?

35:04.102 --> 35:06.974
Above and beyond reality, she is...

35:10.679 --> 35:12.178
flying high.

35:14.092 --> 35:16.174
No. I don't think she's flying anywhere.

35:16.340 --> 35:18.418
-Who is she with?
-Some friends.

35:22.875 --> 35:23.957
And her ex-boyfriend.

35:27.578 --> 35:29.369
This story keeps getting better, kid.

35:29.493 --> 35:32.782
Don't. They haven't been together
for a long time.

35:33.614 --> 35:34.863
Think about it.

35:36.569 --> 35:39.983
She disappears, who does she go with? Him.

35:41.606 --> 35:45.977
This, my young <i>amigo,</i>
is the oldest story in the books.

35:46.518 --> 35:48.391
You're gonna have to face the ex.

35:50.764 --> 35:52.179
No, I don't think so.

37:01.901 --> 37:03.857
OK, bitch.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.433
OK, here we are, then.

37:14.056 --> 37:15.263
How much do I owe you?

37:15.429 --> 37:17.468
Give me 200 and a thank you.

37:20.840 --> 37:21.673
Um...

37:26.127 --> 37:27.750
Thank you very much.

37:29.166 --> 37:32.121
Listen, kid. The moment you find her,

37:32.246 --> 37:34.576
-if she stills recognizes you...
-She will.

37:34.701 --> 37:38.531
...you have to remind her
why she loves you.

37:39.405 --> 37:40.779
Let her know.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.275
I'm not sure that she does love me.

37:44.441 --> 37:47.272
Fucking help me out here a little.
Good luck.

37:47.772 --> 37:48.854
Thanks.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.683
-Fuck off.
-Yeah.

38:03.215 --> 38:05.670
They're gonna eat him alive.

38:10.332 --> 38:13.954
OK, let's see what we got here.

38:14.953 --> 38:17.867
-Hello. Can I see your ticket?
-Sure.

38:18.117 --> 38:19.323
OK.

38:20.115 --> 38:22.528
-So what camp you guys in?
-Camp Chivaree.

38:22.695 --> 38:24.568
-Oh, that's a great camp.
-It is, right?

38:24.693 --> 38:26.566
You guys are getting hotter and hotter
every year.

38:26.691 --> 38:28.023
Excuse me.

38:28.814 --> 38:30.645
Do you know where I can buy a ticket?

38:31.728 --> 38:35.807
Well, you can buy it in the past,
because they sold out six months ago.

38:37.555 --> 38:38.438
I can't get one?

38:38.887 --> 38:41.634
I told you they sold out.
There's no tickets left.

38:52.665 --> 38:53.706
I've gotta get in.

38:53.831 --> 38:57.535
And I should've been Liza Minnelli
but that's life.

39:00.449 --> 39:01.906
I've come a really, really long way.

39:02.031 --> 39:05.111
You don't have a ticket,
I can't let you in. I already told you.

39:05.277 --> 39:09.773
So, please now, clear this space
for people who actually have a ticket, OK?

39:10.023 --> 39:12.978
Oh, my God, people are trying
to get in every year, you know?

39:13.852 --> 39:15.725
Well, I'll see you. Bye.

39:16.474 --> 39:18.889
Oh, monkey, monkey, monkey.

39:21.137 --> 39:22.302
Kid.

39:22.843 --> 39:24.383
Wait, wait, wait.

39:25.215 --> 39:27.838
Are you going to Reno? Yeah, no...

39:43.989 --> 39:46.861
Here, I'm pretty sure this will help.

39:53.271 --> 39:54.436
How'd you get them?

39:54.561 --> 39:57.142
Kid, never underestimate
the kindness of strangers.

39:59.515 --> 40:01.846
-I don't know what to say.
-You could say, "thank you."

40:02.345 --> 40:03.719
Wait, wait.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.758
This is for you.

40:16.456 --> 40:18.996
That's... That's too much.

40:20.369 --> 40:22.658
You won't get her back
without your guitar.

40:31.399 --> 40:34.438
OK, come on now. Let's go party.

40:35.104 --> 40:37.061
Come on. Come on, do it.

40:39.600 --> 40:43.055
This guy over here.
He's been an asshole. I'll handle it.

40:43.221 --> 40:44.386
You!

40:45.135 --> 40:47.592
I can tell you missed me!

40:47.925 --> 40:49.256
You know you can't go in.

40:49.465 --> 40:53.643
I got these two babies that say otherwise.
Radical inclusion, my friend.

40:54.002 --> 40:56.833
Yeah, sure. How can I know
you didn't steal those?

41:01.369 --> 41:04.575
-Who do you take me for?
-Shut up. Let me see those.

41:15.272 --> 41:18.644
OK, boy. It seems like today
is your lucky day. You go ahead.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.849
I'm home, motherfucker!

41:22.016 --> 41:23.139
Thank you.

41:24.388 --> 41:25.720
Come on, kid, come on,

41:29.175 --> 41:30.008
Yeah...

41:32.713 --> 41:33.879
Oh, man.

41:36.251 --> 41:38.874
-Hi there, baby. How are you?
-Hi, gorgeous.

41:39.373 --> 41:40.997
I'm back. I'm back.

41:43.577 --> 41:44.785
Welcome to Burning Man.

41:44.910 --> 41:46.199
Hey, kid, kid, kid.

41:46.574 --> 41:47.865
Gotta be a dust angel.

41:48.197 --> 41:50.904
You got to shout, "I'm not a virgin!"
"I'm not a virgin!"

41:51.028 --> 41:52.610
Come on, shout it. Shout it, kid. Come on!

41:52.735 --> 41:55.149
"I am not a virgin!" Shout it, come on!

41:55.274 --> 41:58.229
-I'm not a virgin.
-"I am not a virgin."

41:58.479 --> 42:02.725
This is fucking paradise, man!

42:02.975 --> 42:04.640
I'm back, baby!

42:04.848 --> 42:07.012
Yeah. Hi, there. Come on, make some hug.

42:08.552 --> 42:09.635
Hey!

42:10.550 --> 42:12.548
Hey, baby. Yeah.

42:15.545 --> 42:17.210
Caronte's back.

42:20.540 --> 42:25.035
There are a thousand places to see, kid,
but you got to see the Temple, OK?

42:25.494 --> 42:29.906
The Temple is the burning soul
of the city.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.069
And this year,
I hear it's fucking outstanding, man.

42:33.194 --> 42:34.568
Fucking outstanding!

42:34.943 --> 42:36.316
Hi, baby. How are you?

42:37.690 --> 42:40.395
Yeah, nice to see you. Caronte's back.

42:40.687 --> 42:42.602
Hey, you looking good, man.

42:43.934 --> 42:45.640
How am I ever gonna find her?

42:45.807 --> 42:50.719
Don't worry, kid.
The Playa always provides.

43:00.209 --> 43:01.416
Eric.

43:02.248 --> 43:03.747
The Man.

43:05.204 --> 43:07.743
The Man, Eric.

43:12.863 --> 43:17.692
Go on. Go on up. The view is breathtaking.

43:20.814 --> 43:21.978
Go on.

44:37.739 --> 44:38.777
Bollocks.

44:39.651 --> 44:42.398
<i>Excuse me, if you were trying</i>
<i>to find someone here,</i>

44:42.523 --> 44:44.272
where's the first place
that you would look?

44:44.771 --> 44:47.018
-Do you know which camp they're in?
-Camps?

44:48.017 --> 44:49.766
I don't really know what you mean.

44:49.849 --> 44:50.931
OK.

44:51.888 --> 44:53.970
Well, the cafe is over there.

44:54.428 --> 44:57.217
You might get lucky there,
everybody goes there eventually.

44:57.342 --> 44:59.090
It's pretty far on foot, though.

45:00.672 --> 45:03.502
Do you know where I can rent a bike?

45:07.748 --> 45:10.911
-Do you have water by any chance?
-Just absinthe.

45:12.118 --> 45:13.701
No, thanks.

45:14.700 --> 45:16.281
-Good luck.
-Good luck, man.

45:16.406 --> 45:17.821
Have a good burn.

45:19.153 --> 45:20.694
So, yeah.

47:01.218 --> 47:04.590
<i>What have we here?</i>
<i>It is a Dark word, all right.</i>

47:05.630 --> 47:08.044
<i>The light patrol is here.</i>

47:08.960 --> 47:12.872
<i>You need to remember the lights!</i>

47:13.456 --> 47:15.412
<i>Well, don't look so confused.</i>

47:15.828 --> 47:18.917
<i>You can't see if you don't wear</i>
<i>some lights, man...</i>

47:19.865 --> 47:21.947
<i>Here you go, we'll light you up.</i>

47:22.904 --> 47:25.652
<i>You need to remember</i>
<i>to wear some lights, man.</i>

47:27.233 --> 47:28.649
<i>Lights!</i>

47:31.146 --> 47:33.768
<i>Come on, man, you gotta wear the lights.</i>

47:34.018 --> 47:36.183
<i>-Feel the light, man.</i>
-Thank you.

47:36.308 --> 47:38.846
<i>Peace out, Burners...</i>

48:01.814 --> 48:03.133
Beautiful, isn't it?

48:05.279 --> 48:06.777
It's magical.

48:09.400 --> 48:10.856
Do we know each other?

48:11.938 --> 48:14.701
Sure. From a past life, I'm sure.

48:20.655 --> 48:24.072
I feel so connected to you right now.

48:30.087 --> 48:31.877
I'm sure we used to be lovers.

48:32.335 --> 48:34.125
Yeah, we used to fuck like animals.

48:34.250 --> 48:35.873
All right, OK.

48:37.413 --> 48:39.702
-It's been a pleasure.
-Where are you going?

48:40.327 --> 48:42.200
I have to find somebody.

48:42.949 --> 48:45.863
You know, we'll see each other again,
maybe in the next life.

48:56.519 --> 48:59.183
-What is it now?
-We like you.

48:59.558 --> 49:01.264
You're so sweet.

49:35.397 --> 49:36.562
Eric?

49:51.205 --> 49:52.546
What are you doing here?

49:53.046 --> 49:54.585
I've come to find Jo.

49:54.752 --> 49:57.292
-You what?
-I've come to find Jo!

50:05.866 --> 50:07.240
What the fuck are you doing?

50:07.365 --> 50:08.946
I'm the lizard king.

50:15.274 --> 50:17.480
Look, I've got to go.
I can't take care of you.

50:21.393 --> 50:23.973
Hey, leave me alone, please.

50:34.712 --> 50:35.878
Let's go.

50:37.043 --> 50:38.167
Who's that?

50:38.708 --> 50:41.331
Oh, man, this guy. A friend of Jo's.

50:41.747 --> 50:43.329
He's a fucking nightmare.

50:43.495 --> 50:44.910
What's he doing here?

50:46.284 --> 50:47.907
I think he's stalking her.

50:49.655 --> 50:51.238
He's written her a song.

50:53.194 --> 50:55.941
I'm the king of the world!

50:56.108 --> 50:58.938
What the fuck? Hey, Eric! Get down!

50:59.230 --> 51:02.476
-I'm the king of the world!
-Eric!

51:03.142 --> 51:04.890
Get down! Eric!

51:20.583 --> 51:22.248
OK, Eric.

51:24.163 --> 51:25.744
Come on, get down.

51:34.652 --> 51:36.942
-Why don't you play something?
-No.

51:37.317 --> 51:40.147
Oh, man. Come on.
I thought you were king of the world.

51:40.729 --> 51:42.477
Hey, guys!

51:44.434 --> 51:47.265
-This is Eric.
-Hello.

51:47.847 --> 51:49.595
He's gonna play us something.

51:52.385 --> 51:53.800
Beautiful kid.

51:58.296 --> 51:59.128
Hi.

51:59.627 --> 52:01.958
Come on, Eric. Just give us a song.

52:24.935 --> 52:28.765

Eric.

54:49.499 --> 54:50.331
What?

54:50.539 --> 54:52.163
I should've eaten something.

55:12.976 --> 55:16.263
I swear yesterday
seemed like a really good idea.

55:18.386 --> 55:19.802
What are you doing here?

55:32.789 --> 55:34.870
I didn't know what was going on.

55:47.316 --> 55:52.602
If there's someone else,
you should have told me.

55:59.138 --> 56:00.511
That's why you came.

56:11.043 --> 56:12.707
I don't want these dramas.

56:16.578 --> 56:18.243
I can't be here right now.

56:18.326 --> 56:21.074
I'm sorry you came all this way
for nothing.

56:29.732 --> 56:31.688
Good morning, Frenchie!

56:50.419 --> 56:52.417
What the fuck is he doing here?

56:54.374 --> 56:55.706
He came for her.

56:55.873 --> 56:59.410
Well, I can see that. How did he get here?

56:59.827 --> 57:00.743
I brought him here.

57:03.448 --> 57:06.945
What the fuck were you thinking?
He's going to ruin everything!

57:07.277 --> 57:09.317
It's pretty clear
that she doesn't want him here, either.

57:09.484 --> 57:10.941
What do you want me to do?

57:42.326 --> 57:43.700
We're not getting ice.

57:44.157 --> 57:46.822
Man, you can't stay with us.

57:57.186 --> 57:59.892
Don't you fuck this experience up
for anyone, all right?

58:00.266 --> 58:02.389
Everything was fine until you came along.

58:04.970 --> 58:07.426
You have no idea why she left, do you?

58:07.967 --> 58:09.626
Do you think it was my fault?

58:19.456 --> 58:20.413
I know Jo.

58:22.673 --> 58:24.411
When she likes something, she bails.

59:00.081 --> 59:02.579
Come. Hey, come.

59:03.495 --> 59:05.076
What the fuck are you doing?

59:05.201 --> 59:07.491
No, Eric! Eric, let go!

59:07.657 --> 59:08.989
-No, Eric!
-You freaked out.

59:09.114 --> 59:10.279
-What?
-I get it now.

59:10.404 --> 59:12.819
-You freaked out and bailed.
-What are you talking about?

59:12.985 --> 59:16.690
Wait! I flew all way to this shithole,
so we can talk.

59:16.815 --> 59:17.814
So you can give me two minutes.

59:17.939 --> 59:20.186
OK, fine, two minutes. Go.

59:25.931 --> 59:28.345
Sometimes life... Life is really...

59:28.511 --> 59:30.009
Oh, shut up, Eric!

59:30.218 --> 59:31.800
Stop running away! You're doing it again!

59:31.925 --> 59:34.005
-Stop running away!
-Shut up!

59:35.838 --> 59:39.167
I think that there's something
really real between us.

59:39.999 --> 59:41.415
But you just left.

59:42.581 --> 59:44.787
You just left without saying a word.

59:45.369 --> 59:46.702
You're just scared.

59:47.991 --> 59:51.613
I can see that. I'm scared too,
but I'm still here. I'm not running away.

59:51.822 --> 59:55.026
You can't tell me that I'm wrong.
You can't tell me that I've made...

01:00:51.345 --> 01:00:52.177
Hey!

01:00:52.761 --> 01:00:56.548
We're gonna tour down the Esplanade.
Do you want to come?

01:00:57.422 --> 01:00:58.796
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah?

01:00:58.962 --> 01:01:00.503
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

01:01:29.848 --> 01:01:31.013
Whoo!

01:01:34.677 --> 01:01:36.800
Look at the octopus that spits fire.

01:01:45.208 --> 01:01:46.665
Look at that tree.

01:01:49.037 --> 01:01:51.493
After the Burn,
some of us are heading to Tijuana.

01:01:51.618 --> 01:01:53.158
It would be incredible
if you could come with us.

01:01:53.241 --> 01:01:54.074
Yeah!

01:01:54.157 --> 01:01:56.363
-You should come with us.
-I'd love to.

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.111
-Then you're coming.
-Sure.

01:01:58.236 --> 01:01:59.777
You'll see, we'll have an amazing time.

01:01:59.859 --> 01:02:00.983
Yeah!

01:02:01.067 --> 01:02:03.440
-Isn't that right, Frenchie?
-What?

01:02:03.606 --> 01:02:06.103
-Tijuana?
-Tijuana, baby!

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:11.265
-Are you going to Tijuana?
-Yeah.

01:02:20.922 --> 01:02:22.337
Oh, look at that.

01:02:23.461 --> 01:02:26.208
Wood again. More and more wood.

01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:29.913
Truth or dare?

01:02:30.454 --> 01:02:32.202
Come on, this game is for kids.

01:02:32.369 --> 01:02:34.117
Then let the children play.

01:02:35.241 --> 01:02:38.738
-Do we really have to play this?
-Oh, come on, Frenchie. It will be fun!

01:02:38.904 --> 01:02:41.152
Eric, truth or dare?

01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:42.816
Truth.

01:02:42.983 --> 01:02:44.565
How many people
would you want to sleep with?

01:02:44.773 --> 01:02:47.479
Or would you like to sleep with?
Or have you slept with?

01:02:48.728 --> 01:02:49.560
Five.

01:02:50.059 --> 01:02:52.182
-Jo beats you in that area.
-Hey, bitch!

01:02:52.266 --> 01:02:54.281
How many people have you slept with?

01:02:54.722 --> 01:02:56.459
Truthfully, more than I would've thought.

01:02:56.599 --> 01:02:58.617
That's a vague reply, don't you think?

01:02:58.967 --> 01:03:00.383
Well, OK, then.

01:03:01.114 --> 01:03:04.504
Let's just say "everyone I ever wanted."

01:03:05.003 --> 01:03:07.875
All right, Queen Bee, let's keep playing.

01:03:08.125 --> 01:03:11.124
-Truth or dare?
-Truth.

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:14.900
What was the weirdest place
you've ever done it?

01:03:16.139 --> 01:03:17.538
Last night, here at Burning Man.

01:03:17.699 --> 01:03:20.529
And I say weird,
because I was at the Lego Pirate Ship.

01:03:24.858 --> 01:03:26.440
It wasn't with me.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:32.563
-Right, Frenchie. Truth or dare?
-Truth.

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.078
Would you sleep with us?

01:03:38.011 --> 01:03:39.010
Shit.

01:03:40.842 --> 01:03:44.890
Let me rephrase.
Would you sleep with us again?

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:54.245
I'm not answering that.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.419
Spoilsport. Dare, then.

01:03:56.493 --> 01:03:58.017
All right, bring it on.

01:03:59.739 --> 01:04:02.154
I dare you to kiss me.

01:04:03.445 --> 01:04:05.276
What's wrong with you today?

01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:20.843
Well, this just got a lot better.

01:04:23.965 --> 01:04:28.607
Eric, truth or dare?

01:04:28.835 --> 01:04:31.224
Are you sure you get to ask
all the questions?

01:04:31.625 --> 01:04:32.831
Is that a dare?

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.219
Truth.

01:04:39.741 --> 01:04:42.792
Have you ever written a song for Jo?

01:04:49.745 --> 01:04:52.323
Listen, rules are rules,

01:04:52.479 --> 01:04:54.900
so either you answer, or you do the dare.

01:04:58.816 --> 01:05:02.013
Well, I'm sorry, but I won't.

01:05:03.759 --> 01:05:05.008
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:05:05.715 --> 01:05:06.668
I've got an idea.

01:05:11.164 --> 01:05:14.499
No. He's too sweet for that.

01:05:14.623 --> 01:05:16.372
I'm not too sweet to do a dare.

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:20.493
You don't even know what it is yet.

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:37.101
Come on, Eric. You can do it.

01:05:37.226 --> 01:05:38.765
Come on, Alex.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.339
Go!

01:05:58.995 --> 01:06:00.203
Get him, Eric!

01:06:34.543 --> 01:06:36.083
Come on!

01:06:40.912 --> 01:06:42.036
Yay!

01:06:49.819 --> 01:06:51.743
Yeah! It was so good.

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:54.814
Did you really have to hit him that hard?

01:06:54.981 --> 01:06:56.687
What? I hardly touched him.

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:58.436
I'm all right, Jo. It's fine.

01:06:58.935 --> 01:07:00.600
Yeah, it wasn't so bad, was it?

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:02.640
I'm OK.

01:07:02.723 --> 01:07:05.138
-You got me a couple of times.
-I had one good one.

01:07:06.095 --> 01:07:08.176
Eric, man. Well played.

01:07:08.301 --> 01:07:10.798
-I mean, I'm glad you came.
-I think I'm gonna puke.

01:07:10.923 --> 01:07:14.295
Look at them. As if nothing happened here.

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:16.210
Hey, come on, give him a break.

01:07:16.335 --> 01:07:18.957
-I'm not doing anything!
-Yes, you are.

01:07:19.623 --> 01:07:22.870
Look, I really do care about him,
so just stop, all right?

01:07:23.869 --> 01:07:26.907
-Hey, guys!
-Am I not allowed to have fun anymore?

01:09:48.265 --> 01:09:49.430
Have you seen my gal?

01:09:50.971 --> 01:09:52.636
You could join us.

01:09:57.049 --> 01:09:58.215
Hey, Eric!

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:00.628
Come and join, it's fun!

01:10:00.795 --> 01:10:03.043
Jo, Jo. Pick those up.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.664
- No.
- Come on, it's fun.

01:10:06.747 --> 01:10:08.121
I'm tired.

01:10:15.363 --> 01:10:20.276
Oi! Queen Bee!
Queen Bee, good morning!

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.232
Come and join us.

01:10:22.981 --> 01:10:25.271
Careful. You're throwing mud outside.

01:10:32.471 --> 01:10:33.303
Morning.

01:10:34.262 --> 01:10:35.802
Or afternoon, whatever it is.

01:10:35.927 --> 01:10:37.134
It's uh... oh!

01:10:40.463 --> 01:10:41.587
Don't know either.

01:10:44.626 --> 01:10:46.867
Hey, are you and Penelope...

01:10:48.165 --> 01:10:49.829
you know, together?

01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:51.869
Hey! Come on!

01:10:53.076 --> 01:10:55.948
-Why don't you join them?
-No.

01:10:56.531 --> 01:10:57.488
No.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.401
God... I just got rid
of about five pounds of dust.

01:11:01.526 --> 01:11:03.025
Yeah, man. It's really dusty.

01:11:04.024 --> 01:11:07.229
When you get used to it,
it's so fucking worth it.

01:11:16.844 --> 01:11:19.883
So, um... how long have you known Jo?

01:11:22.421 --> 01:11:25.169
Uh... like a month.

01:11:25.293 --> 01:11:27.666
A month and you travel the world for her?
Fucking hell, man.

01:11:27.791 --> 01:11:29.124
A little bit more.

01:11:29.248 --> 01:11:31.163
She must have hit you pretty hard, huh?

01:11:32.037 --> 01:11:32.870
Well...

01:11:33.244 --> 01:11:35.658
Yeah, maybe.

01:11:36.824 --> 01:11:39.654
-What about you and Penelope?
-Five years.

01:11:39.988 --> 01:11:41.652
-Five years?
-Yeah.

01:11:42.401 --> 01:11:47.106
But I travel a lot with work,
so we barely see each other.

01:11:49.062 --> 01:11:50.435
How'd you cope with that?

01:11:51.476 --> 01:11:53.620
You know, we've learned to trust.
Find a balance.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.512
Mmm...

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.966
It's important, ain't it?
Finding a balance.

01:12:02.298 --> 01:12:05.337
Yeah, man.
It's what we're all looking for.

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:11.622
Here.

01:12:12.455 --> 01:12:14.244
-I'm gonna go in.
-Yeah?

01:12:15.327 --> 01:12:16.409
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

01:12:16.534 --> 01:12:17.366
Yeah.

01:12:19.739 --> 01:12:21.072
Yeah!

01:12:21.362 --> 01:12:23.194
Eric, get in!

01:14:29.193 --> 01:14:30.525
Have you seen that?

01:14:34.396 --> 01:14:36.602
They call it the Temple of Promise.

01:14:38.684 --> 01:14:40.932
It's amazing that this place exists.

01:14:48.549 --> 01:14:49.964
You could make that.

01:14:54.793 --> 01:14:56.124
Yeah, right

01:14:56.416 --> 01:14:58.497
Really, you could.

01:15:11.692 --> 01:15:15.605
The song. Play me the song.

01:15:16.479 --> 01:15:17.645
What song?

01:15:17.770 --> 01:15:19.018
What song?

01:15:19.643 --> 01:15:21.557
Come on, play it.

01:15:25.512 --> 01:15:27.385
It's not finished yet.

01:15:27.926 --> 01:15:29.799
I don't care. Play it.

01:15:34.586 --> 01:15:37.708
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.

01:15:39.539 --> 01:15:40.455
OK.

01:15:55.190 --> 01:15:56.356

It's fine.

01:18:51.222 --> 01:18:52.513
You liked it.

01:18:54.344 --> 01:18:55.510
You liked it.

01:18:59.298 --> 01:19:02.253
-It's really good, Eric.
-Yeah?

01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:06.291
Yeah. You're really talented.

01:19:20.443 --> 01:19:22.608
Hey, they're gonna burn the Man soon.

01:19:24.023 --> 01:19:25.771
Let's go and find the others, yeah?

01:19:26.770 --> 01:19:28.934
Come on, it's our last night.

01:19:30.225 --> 01:19:32.348
-OK.
-Burning Man.

01:20:29.166 --> 01:20:31.164
I'm not going to Tijuana anymore.

01:20:32.912 --> 01:20:34.910
I'm coming back to London with you.

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.073
For school?

01:20:39.947 --> 01:20:41.695
Amongst other things.

01:21:34.725 --> 01:21:38.888
Listen. I know I'm a bit
of a bitch sometimes

01:21:39.013 --> 01:21:43.259
but it's just because,
I love you and all that.

01:21:43.509 --> 01:21:46.464
Mmm... I love you too, P.

01:21:48.087 --> 01:21:51.584
This has been amazing, this place.

01:21:52.208 --> 01:21:54.747
And now, for Tijuana.

01:21:56.537 --> 01:21:58.494
-Tijuana.
-Tijuana.

01:21:59.773 --> 01:22:02.655
Come on, this is our last night.
Let's enjoy it.

01:22:03.072 --> 01:22:04.987
Immediacy!

01:22:09.483 --> 01:22:11.855
-I'm beat.
-Yeah, me too, actually.

01:22:18.973 --> 01:22:20.263
What now?

01:22:20.887 --> 01:22:26.382
You, me, Jo, Tijuana.

01:22:27.006 --> 01:22:28.547
She's not coming.

01:22:29.837 --> 01:22:31.002
What?

01:22:31.127 --> 01:22:32.501
I thought you knew.

01:22:41.284 --> 01:22:42.699
Guys!

01:22:43.906 --> 01:22:46.487
The night is young, right?
You said it, Frenchie.

01:22:47.153 --> 01:22:50.857
It's the last night.
Come on, Frenchie, you said it.

01:22:51.107 --> 01:22:53.854
-One more drink.
-Come on, guys.

01:22:53.979 --> 01:22:56.269
One more, Frenchie, come on.

01:22:57.226 --> 01:22:59.266
Now! Come on, come on!

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:01.971
All right. OK, I'm coming.

01:23:04.635 --> 01:23:07.258
-You go back, I'll join you in a bit.
-No, I'll come.

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:09.048
You said you were tired.

01:23:09.922 --> 01:23:11.795
I don't mind. I'm good.

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.541
Look, you go back.
Relax, and I'll be back soon.

01:23:24.033 --> 01:23:26.072
You're afraid I might run away
or something?

01:23:26.738 --> 01:23:27.570
No.

01:23:31.067 --> 01:23:32.483
Right, I'll see you.

01:23:33.814 --> 01:23:35.188
Come on!

01:24:47.699 --> 01:24:49.905
What's wrong, man? Come join us.

01:24:55.524 --> 01:24:57.647
Who are you looking for, little fawn?

01:25:00.145 --> 01:25:01.394
Where's Jo?

01:25:05.015 --> 01:25:06.389
Where's Jo?

01:25:06.971 --> 01:25:08.428
Let's play a little game.

01:25:09.011 --> 01:25:12.590
You keep looking for her
and I'll tell you if you're hot or cold.

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.505
No. I'm not in the mood for games.

01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:15.796
Cold.

01:25:20.624 --> 01:25:22.290
Colder. Colder. Colder.

01:25:22.455 --> 01:25:24.412
-Just tell me where she is!
-Warmer.

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:26.161
Warmer. Warmer.

01:25:29.948 --> 01:25:31.114
Hot.

01:25:47.181 --> 01:25:49.387
Are you gonna try
and follow her to Tijuana?

01:25:49.512 --> 01:25:51.968
Just stop playing games with me!

01:25:52.759 --> 01:25:53.591
Hey!

01:25:54.965 --> 01:25:56.713
What the fuck are you doing?

01:25:57.795 --> 01:25:59.377
Eric, down now!

01:25:59.668 --> 01:26:01.416
-Jo?
-Shit.

01:26:01.541 --> 01:26:03.332
What the fuck is going on?

01:26:03.456 --> 01:26:06.828
Stop! Eric, what's wrong with you?
Calm down.

01:26:09.908 --> 01:26:11.365
I thought you were with him.

01:26:13.446 --> 01:26:14.487
No.

01:26:15.444 --> 01:26:17.026
Why did you come?

01:26:17.151 --> 01:26:20.439
-He needed to put you on a leash!
-You shut up!

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.600
Did you really think I was gonna bail?

01:26:30.055 --> 01:26:31.137
Tell me.

01:26:32.095 --> 01:26:34.425
-Tell me!
-Yeah, I did.

01:26:35.466 --> 01:26:36.840
Of course I did.

01:26:39.213 --> 01:26:40.627
Like you always do.

01:26:43.125 --> 01:26:44.998
You're fucking stupid.

01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:50.202
I was coming back for you, Eric.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.656
Jo, I'm sorry.

01:26:54.822 --> 01:26:58.984
Eric, I love you, I love you...

01:27:00.233 --> 01:27:02.148
but this isn't gonna work.

01:27:03.521 --> 01:27:05.187
This isn't gonna work.

01:27:12.512 --> 01:27:13.803
Go home.

01:27:22.086 --> 01:27:23.501
Hi, Frenchie.

01:27:23.876 --> 01:27:25.707
Hey! Frenchie!

01:27:26.915 --> 01:27:27.785
Come on!

01:27:29.038 --> 01:27:31.743
-Frenchie, come on!
-Fuck you!

01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:13.659
Hey, kid!

01:28:15.033 --> 01:28:16.656
What's the matter with you?

01:28:25.397 --> 01:28:26.563
How'd it go?

01:28:26.730 --> 01:28:27.562
Huh?

01:28:30.018 --> 01:28:30.851
Huh?

01:28:31.308 --> 01:28:32.390
Where's the girl?

01:28:34.263 --> 01:28:35.554
It didn't go well.

01:28:50.872 --> 01:28:52.745
You did everything you could do.

01:28:53.369 --> 01:28:55.742
Shit, you even came to fucking Nevada!

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.443
And it was all for nothing.

01:29:05.441 --> 01:29:06.506
Don't say that!

01:29:07.230 --> 01:29:09.645
Love is never useless.

01:29:10.311 --> 01:29:11.144
Huh?

01:29:11.518 --> 01:29:14.265
It's just like shaking up
some things inside.

01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:18.137
Right.

01:29:19.885 --> 01:29:21.383
Look where it brought you.

01:29:21.883 --> 01:29:23.923
You are not the same man.

01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:33.663
Maybe she was only ever supposed to be
that girl you wrote a song about.

01:29:44.777 --> 01:29:47.482
I gotta get my stuff. I've gotta go home.

01:29:47.774 --> 01:29:49.813
Come on. Come on.

01:29:49.938 --> 01:29:52.519
Come on. It's OK. It's OK.

01:29:53.976 --> 01:29:57.139
Come on, come on. It's OK.

01:29:58.513 --> 01:29:59.762
It's OK. Hey, hey...

01:30:02.384 --> 01:30:04.298
I'll see you at the station, OK?

01:30:04.715 --> 01:30:06.296
Don't fuck with me, huh?

01:30:07.337 --> 01:30:09.210
Don't fuck with me. Don't fuck with me.

01:30:09.293 --> 01:30:11.750
Don't fuck with me. OK?

01:30:12.332 --> 01:30:13.831
I'll see you at the station.

01:33:20.102 --> 01:33:20.976
Wow!

01:33:22.434 --> 01:33:24.765
Now I know why you went so crazy.

01:33:26.471 --> 01:33:28.844
Now what? Back to London?

01:33:35.004 --> 01:33:36.253
Actually...

01:33:37.575 --> 01:33:39.673
I think there's a bar in Nashville
I need to play at.

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:45.647
You bet your ass you gotta play there.

01:33:55.192 --> 01:33:56.056
Where's the taxi?

01:33:57.065 --> 01:33:59.063
-I traded it for the tickets.
-What?

01:33:59.563 --> 01:34:02.394
Geez, kid. Relax.
It's not like it was mine.

01:34:02.602 --> 01:34:05.682
I'll figure something out. I always do.

01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:10.677
How many miles to go?

01:34:11.925 --> 01:34:13.299
Two thousand.

01:34:13.965 --> 01:34:15.137
I'm tired.
