Ever since Star was little,
she believed her name

00:03.105 --> 00:04.571
was who she was.

00:04.573 --> 00:07.307
But I told her fame is a trip.

00:07.332 --> 00:10.044
It ain't love, like a lot of people think.

00:10.046 --> 00:12.379
But she wouldn't listen.

00:12.381 --> 00:14.948
Star don't listen to nobody but herself.

Think so?

For real.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.137
I sounds so good.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.777
I'm not finished writing it, though.

00:38.802 --> 00:39.912
What do you have to add?

00:39.937 --> 00:41.575
I have to add your vocal at the end.

Right. Like me going to New York

Do you see this place?
Can you see it? Look.

00:54.757 --> 00:56.723
Look, you see her?
That's what meth'll do to you.

00:57.526 --> 00:59.126
That's where I live.

00:59.128 --> 01:00.694
Well, we got to figure out something.

01:00.696 --> 01:02.362
This video chat thing is getting old.

01:02.364 --> 01:04.230
Okay, I get it. We should
be in the same city

01:04.233 --> 01:05.632
if we're gonna do this for real.

01:05.634 --> 01:06.579
I'm telling you.

01:06.604 --> 01:08.635
First thing I'm gonna do when I turn 18

01:08.637 --> 01:10.571
is go get my sister.

01:10.573 --> 01:13.073
You're gonna love her. She has a voice...

01:13.075 --> 01:15.909
almost as good as mine? Not quite?

01:15.911 --> 01:17.028
Wow, okay.

01:17.053 --> 01:20.647
Hey. Get in here and
do these dishes, now.

01:20.649 --> 01:22.116
All right, got to go.

01:22.118 --> 01:23.584
Ursula's calling.

01:23.586 --> 01:27.020
She ain't worth the money
we're getting for her.

01:27.022 --> 01:30.124
Mama, that ain't how you peel a potato.

01:34.597 --> 01:35.796
Where'd you get that phone?

01:35.798 --> 01:37.698
Obama.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.900
Do them dishes now, smart ass.

01:45.941 --> 01:47.941
Dishes?

01:47.943 --> 01:49.776
Sink?

01:49.778 --> 01:52.246
Hello?

01:52.248 --> 01:54.181
Do them damn dishes.

01:56.118 --> 01:58.418
- Where are you going?
- Social services.

01:58.443 --> 02:00.275
- Oh, no, you're not.
- I'm going to beg them

02:00.277 --> 02:01.321
to process me out of here.

02:01.323 --> 02:03.624
Oh, hell, no. Oh, you get
back here right now.

02:03.626 --> 02:05.759
You better learn how to
work that washing machine.

02:05.761 --> 02:08.595
Oh, God... how dare you
speak to me like that,

02:08.597 --> 02:10.097
as much as I've done for you?

02:10.098 --> 02:11.732
Get your ass back right now...

02:11.734 --> 02:13.934
You want money from your trust for what?

02:15.004 --> 02:17.304
I met this girl on Instagram.

02:17.306 --> 02:19.940
She has a great voice, Dad. I mean,

02:19.942 --> 02:21.942
perfect for the songs I've been
writing, and I just...

02:21.944 --> 02:24.611
The Internet? What-what girl?

02:24.613 --> 02:26.747
She's this white girl from Pittsburg.

02:26.772 --> 02:29.267
She grew up in foster care,
and everything she's been through

02:29.269 --> 02:31.652
is in her voice. It's real, Dad.

02:31.654 --> 02:33.954
And we need to get in the studio.

02:33.956 --> 02:35.489
I want my money.

02:35.491 --> 02:36.890
Your money?

02:36.892 --> 02:38.926
So you want me to open up your trust fund

02:38.928 --> 02:41.061
for some white trash
you met on the Internet?

02:41.063 --> 02:44.031
She's just using you to get to me.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.566
She doesn't even know about you.

02:45.568 --> 02:48.391
I made up an Instagram account

02:48.416 --> 02:50.270
with a different name.

02:50.272 --> 02:52.005
Oh, so you're ashamed of my name?

02:52.007 --> 02:54.708
So, I guess that means you're not gonna

02:54.710 --> 02:56.710
sing background for me, either, huh?

02:56.712 --> 02:58.679
You still don't get it.

02:58.681 --> 03:01.348
I need to break out on my own, Dad.

03:01.350 --> 03:03.917
I need to make music that feeds my soul.

03:03.919 --> 03:05.719
And my music don't?

03:05.721 --> 03:08.088
My soul, not yours.

03:08.090 --> 03:09.826
When's the last time you felt something

03:09.851 --> 03:11.017
when you sang your songs?

03:11.042 --> 03:12.806
You need to get back
to your old stuff, Dad.

03:12.831 --> 03:14.437
Not this trash you've been trying.

03:14.462 --> 03:19.120
Who do you think you're talking
to, you talentless brat?

03:19.145 --> 03:21.045
You sound just like your mother.

03:24.740 --> 03:27.040
Star, you've been through

03:27.042 --> 03:29.910
six foster families in
the last two years.

03:29.912 --> 03:32.079
You're a thief, habitual liar,

03:32.081 --> 03:34.481
and you have no regard for rules.

03:34.483 --> 03:35.682
And you want what?

03:35.684 --> 03:36.917
Simone's address.

03:36.919 --> 03:38.151
You must out your mind.

03:38.153 --> 03:40.654
I'm about to be old enough
to take care of her.

03:40.656 --> 03:43.190
All you got to do is tell
me where she's at.

03:43.192 --> 03:45.092
Sit down.

03:45.094 --> 03:46.760
Please, just tell me where she is.

03:46.762 --> 03:49.029
- It's not going to happen, Star.
- Why?

03:49.031 --> 03:50.297
'Cause you've got a record.

03:50.299 --> 03:51.698
So you're not getting any information

03:51.700 --> 03:53.300
on a child in the system,

03:53.302 --> 03:55.135
even if she was your sister.

03:55.137 --> 03:56.970
Rachel has a boyfriend.

03:56.972 --> 03:58.339
No, I don't.

03:58.364 --> 04:00.574
- He's just a friend.
- Well, I hope so.

04:00.576 --> 04:02.542
You think it's any easier

04:02.544 --> 04:03.744
on the outside?

04:03.746 --> 04:05.779
Do you even have anywhere to go?

04:05.781 --> 04:08.181
Finish up, you two, or
you're gonna be late for school.

04:08.183 --> 04:09.783
I'll take 'em. You can go to work

04:09.785 --> 04:11.952
and I'll just drop 'em off on my way.

04:13.648 --> 04:16.255
Oh, she think she running our house now.

04:16.257 --> 04:19.026
I guess that's what happens
when you think you white.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.390
But you ain't white, Simone.

04:21.415 --> 04:23.266
You ain't no better than
anybody else in this house.

04:23.290 --> 04:24.364
I never said I was.

04:24.366 --> 04:26.566
Oh, you want to end up on the streets,

04:26.568 --> 04:29.336
addicted, just like your mother?

04:29.338 --> 04:32.005
Don't talk about my mother.

04:32.007 --> 04:34.708
You finna make me call security again?

04:38.282 --> 04:40.547
We're not gonna end up like her.

04:40.549 --> 04:43.417
We're not, but you got to
tell me where she is.

04:43.419 --> 04:46.286
I haven't seen her in five years,
and she needs somebody

04:46.288 --> 04:48.055
to take care of her.

04:48.057 --> 04:49.756
Come on, kids, it's time for school.

04:51.026 --> 04:54.461
- Miss Ruth, can you drop me off?
- Sure, come on.

04:54.463 --> 04:57.030
Oh, she ain't got no class till later.
I'll take her to school.

05:01.403 --> 05:03.136
Clean up the kitchen.

05:03.138 --> 05:05.287
Do you know what the system

05:05.312 --> 05:07.284
does to us?

05:07.309 --> 05:08.508
I know, Star.

05:08.510 --> 05:09.710
You know?

05:09.712 --> 05:11.311
Well, then let me see my sister.

05:14.116 --> 05:16.249
You gon' make me lose my job.

05:22.558 --> 05:25.058
They're gonna process
you out of the system.

05:25.060 --> 05:27.327
And I better not hear
my name out your mouth.

05:31.734 --> 05:33.867
One ticket to Harrisburg.

05:33.869 --> 05:35.135
Round trip?

05:35.137 --> 05:36.770
Hell no.

05:36.772 --> 05:38.505
Next time you see this face,

05:38.507 --> 05:41.274
it's gonna be on the
cover of Vanity Fair.

I've been looking for
Star and her sister Simone

05:56.358 --> 05:59.426
for ten years now,
ever since their mother passed

05:59.428 --> 06:00.827
and Social Services took 'em.

06:00.829 --> 06:03.830
Please help me find 'em.

06:06.101 --> 06:08.335
Those girls sing like angels.

06:08.337 --> 06:11.104
They need to be safe with each
other under the same roof.

06:16.745 --> 06:18.378
Simone?

06:18.380 --> 06:20.547
I can still
hear 'em in my head,

06:20.549 --> 06:23.049
voices like their mama had.

06:25.788 --> 06:27.187
Hello?

06:35.931 --> 06:37.431
Hello?

06:43.605 --> 06:45.705
Daddy's little girl.

06:47.709 --> 06:49.651
You're hurting me.

07:36.091 --> 07:39.359
Star! Oh, my God, stop it!

07:39.361 --> 07:40.794
Stop it!

07:43.332 --> 07:44.598
You killed him!

07:44.600 --> 07:46.199
What the...?!

07:46.201 --> 07:49.102
Oh, my God. I want... I want Mama.

07:50.339 --> 07:52.105
Mama's dead.

07:52.107 --> 07:53.406
She's not coming back.

07:53.408 --> 07:55.108
- I came for you.
- Oh, God, no.

07:55.110 --> 07:57.154
Okay? Where does he keep his keys?

07:57.179 --> 07:58.088
In his...

07:58.113 --> 08:00.046
- Where does he keep his keys?
- Back pocket!

08:00.048 --> 08:02.315
Go get your stuff.

08:02.317 --> 08:04.317
Oh, my God.

08:15.797 --> 08:18.532
How long has he been doing that to you?

08:21.937 --> 08:23.737
What if they come looking for us?

08:23.739 --> 08:26.039
They won't, okay?

08:26.041 --> 08:27.974
Just put it out your head.

08:29.811 --> 08:31.745
You still sing?

08:31.747 --> 08:34.347
Yeah, I still sing.

08:51.567 --> 08:53.567
I got a plan.

08:53.569 --> 08:56.136
We're gonna start in Atlanta.

- Where we gon' live?

08:59.808 --> 09:01.975
There's this lady named Miss Carlotta.

09:01.977 --> 09:04.010
She's been writing
letters to Social Services

09:04.012 --> 09:05.712

09:06.949 --> 09:09.249
We still got family left?

09:09.251 --> 09:10.717
I guess.

09:10.719 --> 09:13.253
At least a place to crash.

09:13.255 --> 09:14.588
Hello?

09:14.590 --> 09:15.889
Hey, it's me.

09:15.891 --> 09:17.657
I got a TracFone,
so I don't have a lot of time

09:17.659 --> 09:21.294
to talk, but I just left Pittsburg,

09:21.296 --> 09:22.662
and I'm with my sister.

09:22.664 --> 09:23.930
We're headed to Atlanta and we got

09:23.932 --> 09:25.765
- a place to crash.
- Atlanta?

09:25.767 --> 09:27.601
Are you in or not?

09:36.111 --> 09:37.243
What do you want?

09:37.245 --> 09:38.445
It's okay.

09:38.447 --> 09:39.713
Good morning, Alexandra.

09:39.715 --> 09:41.848
Morning. Thanks, Charles.

09:41.850 --> 09:44.284
Hello.

09:44.286 --> 09:47.454
Damn girl, you straight
off a page of Vogue.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.022
But you are shorter than I thought.

09:49.024 --> 09:51.291
And you're heavier than I thought.

09:51.293 --> 09:52.926
Oh, my God.

09:52.928 --> 09:54.995
I can't believe I'm doing this.

09:54.997 --> 09:56.196
No second thoughts, girl.

09:56.198 --> 09:57.697
You're the special hot in the sauce.

09:57.699 --> 09:59.577
What's going on with her?

10:01.770 --> 10:04.504
Never mind. Let's just do this.

10:12.648 --> 10:14.681
I'm not getting my stuff
stolen in this dive.

10:14.683 --> 10:16.580
You're actually ridiculous.

10:16.605 --> 10:18.446
Well, everything ain't Fendi
and Prada, Alexandra.

10:18.470 --> 10:20.016
You need to let your weave down, girl.

10:20.041 --> 10:21.554
Oh, Blondie.

10:21.556 --> 10:23.189
This is real.

10:23.191 --> 10:24.591
Not all black girls wear weaves.

10:27.129 --> 10:28.862
Your sister's half black?

10:30.384 --> 10:32.399
Yeah, her dad was black.

10:32.401 --> 10:34.934
Did you ever think when
I hit you up on the 'Gram

10:34.936 --> 10:36.169
you'd end up like this?

10:36.171 --> 10:38.304
No.

10:40.275 --> 10:42.709
But I'm glad you saved me.

10:46.348 --> 10:48.048
I mean, the music we're making...

10:48.050 --> 10:50.183
It's my new life.

10:51.086 --> 10:52.619
I'm not going back.

10:53.789 --> 10:55.221
Your parents cool with that?

10:55.958 --> 10:57.958

My dad's a surgeon.

11:02.164 --> 11:05.965

11:05.967 --> 11:08.434

12:03.358 --> 12:05.592
Simone, what did I tell you?

12:05.594 --> 12:08.995
It's the only undershirt I got,
unlike Princess Peach over here.

12:08.997 --> 12:11.965
I told you that everything
about our life has to go.

12:11.967 --> 12:14.634
I meant everything.

12:14.636 --> 12:18.037
I killed that man for us.

12:18.039 --> 12:20.507
Now we can focus on our dream.

Our dream?

Your dream.

12:24.446 --> 12:26.012
Take that shirt off.

12:26.014 --> 12:28.481
I'm not taking it off.

12:28.483 --> 12:31.818
This has his blood on it,

13:31.213 --> 13:32.812
- I have a GPS.
- Um, yes. Yes, we're here.

13:32.814 --> 13:34.647

13:34.649 --> 13:35.782

figure out what's going on, okay?

13:39.887 --> 13:41.144

13:41.168 --> 13:43.122
I just said two minutes?

13:43.124 --> 13:45.625
What, do you think I'm
gonna eat you or something?

13:45.627 --> 13:47.894
Bitch, all you eat is greens.

13:47.896 --> 13:50.496
- Mm.
- Hmm.

13:59.908 --> 14:01.808
Is Carlotta here?

14:01.810 --> 14:04.344
You find us on Groupon or something?

14:04.346 --> 14:06.057
Let me see who the little
white girl is, hold on.

14:06.081 --> 14:07.947
Yeah, we'd be lucky to get on Groupon.

14:07.949 --> 14:09.249
Carlotta's my mama.

14:09.251 --> 14:10.950
She ain't here.

14:10.952 --> 14:12.218
She at church.

14:12.220 --> 14:13.753
Oh, okay. Well, when is she back?

14:13.755 --> 14:15.188
Why you want to know?

14:24.299 --> 14:25.865

Carlotta about to gag, honey.

you and your sister

14:30.939 --> 14:33.306
a long time.

14:33.308 --> 14:34.774

Girl, you're too young to have arteries.

16:49.254 --> 16:51.621
I'm surprised you never
set foot in a church.

16:51.623 --> 16:54.557
Nothing wrong with being an atheist.

16:54.559 --> 16:55.792
What's up, Miss C?

16:55.794 --> 16:57.293
- You gonna burn.
- Hey, hey.

16:57.295 --> 17:00.230
Now, I know you came
by for the food, 'cause

17:00.232 --> 17:01.931
I certainly ain't seen you in service.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.134
You knew we was busy today
with the activism thing.

17:04.136 --> 17:06.469
Come on. How y'all doing,
ladies? I'm Derek.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.070
I live next door to Miss Carlotta.

17:08.073 --> 17:10.339
And he always activating about something.

17:10.342 --> 17:12.308
What is it this time?

17:12.310 --> 17:14.810
Racial inequality in the
criminal justice system.

17:14.813 --> 17:16.512
This weekend we're having this rally, and

17:16.515 --> 17:17.946
I really need your help.

17:17.949 --> 17:21.317
Let the church folk know
I'm good people. Can you?

17:21.319 --> 17:24.454
Check it out.

17:25.220 --> 17:26.489
I'll see what I can do.

17:26.491 --> 17:27.924
Miss C, this is me you're talking to.

17:27.925 --> 17:29.010
You know how hard we worked for this.

17:29.034 --> 17:31.167
- Miss C, please.
- Okay, boy. Get out of here.

17:32.945 --> 17:35.078
Well, it's much appreciated.

17:35.867 --> 17:37.667
Y'all ladies have a nice day.

17:37.669 --> 17:39.235
- Bye.
- Come on, y'all.

17:39.237 --> 17:40.637
Say, bye, Derek.

17:42.541 --> 17:43.807
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

17:43.809 --> 17:48.645
So... you're like our new mother now?

17:52.417 --> 17:54.951
Your foster parents
treating you all right?

17:54.953 --> 17:56.820
Yeah. Simone and I both

17:56.822 --> 17:58.421
got real lucky.

17:58.423 --> 18:01.858
And what kind of foster
care you come from?

18:01.860 --> 18:03.526
I'm actually not from a foster family.

18:03.528 --> 18:07.897
My parents just think traveling
is a real learning experience.

18:07.899 --> 18:10.400
And we heard the music
scene in Atlanta was crazy.

18:10.402 --> 18:12.402
And we're a girl group.

18:14.845 --> 18:18.018
Me and your mother had a
group before y'all were born.

18:18.043 --> 18:20.510
- We even had a song hit the charts.
- What?

18:20.512 --> 18:21.411
- That's crazy.
- What was the name of the group?

18:21.413 --> 18:22.545
Was she pretty?

18:22.547 --> 18:23.713
Look, y'all want to sing.

18:23.715 --> 18:25.415
Why don't you come
sing with me in Church?

18:25.417 --> 18:26.449
"Church"?

18:26.451 --> 18:27.751
Yes, you little witch.

18:27.753 --> 18:28.852
Church.

18:29.988 --> 18:32.522
Look, why are y'all really here?

18:32.524 --> 18:35.058
You looking to stay with me?

18:37.562 --> 18:39.062
Yes.

18:40.766 --> 18:42.799
Okay, then.

18:42.801 --> 18:43.967
Well, let's get home.

18:43.969 --> 18:45.301
We got a busy week ahead of us.

18:45.303 --> 18:47.237
What does that mean?

18:47.239 --> 18:50.006
You want to stay with me,
you got to contribute.

18:50.008 --> 18:53.643
My shampoo girl got
pregnant and quit... again.

18:53.645 --> 18:55.345
You know how to shampoo hair?

18:55.347 --> 18:56.446
She do.

18:56.448 --> 18:58.414
Grab my keys.

18:58.416 --> 18:59.716
I'm going.

19:01.353 --> 19:02.852
I'm not shampooing anyone's hair.

19:02.854 --> 19:04.154
I got a sick plan.

19:04.156 --> 19:06.790
You just got to learn
how to be a part of it.

19:06.792 --> 19:08.558
Just come on.

19:08.560 --> 19:11.261
This is my wax room.

19:11.263 --> 19:15.632
Clean it up, and y'all can
take the bed or the floor.

19:15.634 --> 19:17.367
The bed or the floor, huh?

19:20.205 --> 19:23.173
Can I, can I sleep in your room?

19:23.175 --> 19:25.408
You don't want to sleep
with the other girls?

19:25.410 --> 19:27.677
They're just gonna be
singing all night and stuff.

19:27.679 --> 19:29.879
I thought you wanted to sing.

19:32.951 --> 19:35.385
Come on, I got a daybed
you could sleep in.

19:35.387 --> 19:36.586
But don't be snoring.

19:36.588 --> 19:37.687

19:56.441 --> 19:59.075
why are we rehearsing
when we ain't got no gigs?

19:59.077 --> 20:00.977

20:00.979 --> 20:03.112

20:05.016 --> 20:07.917

20:19.965 --> 20:22.398
What are you doing?

20:22.400 --> 20:24.234
I'm standing in the middle. I sing lead.

20:24.236 --> 20:26.035
There is no lead.

20:26.037 --> 20:28.523
I wrote this song to
showcase all of our voices.

20:28.548 --> 20:29.405
Where do you want me?

20:29.430 --> 20:32.919
You want me here, or, like, one inch over?

20:32.944 --> 20:34.978
Are we rehearsing?

20:36.414 --> 20:37.680
Or no?

20:40.752 --> 20:43.853
Miss Bruce, I am loving
this splash of color.

20:43.855 --> 20:45.655
What's the inspiration?

20:45.657 --> 20:47.690
Girl, Rihanna,

20:47.692 --> 20:50.441
Charlize Theron mixed with
Lupita Nyong'o, honey.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.128
I got a taste for some grits.

20:52.130 --> 20:53.763
- Morning, Miss Carlotta.
- Hi.

20:53.765 --> 20:56.199
Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord. God is good.

20:56.201 --> 20:57.533
- Ain't He, though?
- Yes.

20:57.535 --> 21:00.103
All day.

21:01.339 --> 21:03.873
You got some kind of problem, Star?

21:05.277 --> 21:07.261
Star don't feel like working.

21:07.286 --> 21:08.385
Star will get past that.

21:08.410 --> 21:10.557
Oh, my God!

21:10.582 --> 21:12.181
Oh, my God!

21:12.183 --> 21:13.082
What happened?

21:13.084 --> 21:15.652
I just burned myself on
this busted-ass sink.

21:15.654 --> 21:17.921
What's wrong with you, girl?

21:17.923 --> 21:22.091
Carlotta, you got a white girl
in here messing up my hair.

21:22.771 --> 21:23.736
Really?

21:26.431 --> 21:27.397
Roberta.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.433
I'm out of here.

21:30.435 --> 21:33.269
Hey, Roberta, you still got to pay.

21:34.639 --> 21:35.805
Carlotta, I don't

21:35.807 --> 21:36.973
know why you let

21:36.975 --> 21:38.659
that little Caucasian to work in here.

21:38.684 --> 21:41.377
She can't even work a shampoo
ball, nasty attitude.

21:41.379 --> 21:42.581
Always something wrong with her.

21:42.605 --> 21:43.746
What did you just say, bitch?

21:43.748 --> 21:46.277
Say it one more time for me.

21:46.302 --> 21:48.084
I'm really, really tired

21:48.086 --> 21:49.719
of you two Bible-thumping
whores... yes, you...

21:49.721 --> 21:50.920

21:50.922 --> 21:52.488

21:52.490 --> 21:54.123
See, that's my cue.

21:54.125 --> 21:55.625

21:55.627 --> 21:57.994

know anything about me,

21:57.996 --> 21:59.062

21:59.064 --> 22:00.663

- Star.

22:02.701 --> 22:04.067

22:04.069 --> 22:05.535
Come on upstairs. Let's talk.

22:05.537 --> 22:08.538
You're a racist... bitch.

22:08.540 --> 22:09.772
And now that you finished,

22:09.774 --> 22:11.728
bitch your little ass right
on out the door.

22:12.995 --> 22:15.663
Mouth just like her mother's.

22:15.688 --> 22:17.847
What was our mother like, Miss Carlotta?

22:17.849 --> 22:20.183
Am I just like her?

22:20.185 --> 22:22.819
You high, ain't you?

22:22.821 --> 22:26.255
Come on, let's walk that buzz off.

22:26.257 --> 22:27.523
I'm going to Church.

22:27.525 --> 22:29.792
I'll tell you all about your mama.
Mail that for me.

22:35.066 --> 22:37.266
Star, we've been here for over a week.

22:37.268 --> 22:39.369
I've been shampooing goat hair,

22:39.371 --> 22:42.372
sleeping in a bed with you and
living off of fried apple pies.

22:42.374 --> 22:43.773
What we need to do is

22:43.775 --> 22:45.775
get in the studio and lay some tracks.

22:45.777 --> 22:48.211
But this woman's in here
working us like dogs.

22:48.213 --> 22:53.149
Look, we got to figure this out,
or I got to go.

22:53.151 --> 22:55.084
Oh. Go!

22:55.086 --> 22:56.919
Go back to New York City.

22:56.921 --> 22:58.888
I've got nowhere to go.

22:58.890 --> 23:00.957
All I've been doing is
trying to figure this out.

23:00.959 --> 23:02.792
And all we got to do is
get to Jay Z or Future

23:02.794 --> 23:04.727
or 50's tired ass. I don't care.

23:04.729 --> 23:07.163
They're not just sitting
in a room waiting for us.

23:07.165 --> 23:08.464
We need to build some kind of a buzz.

23:08.466 --> 23:10.700
Get our faces out there.

23:10.702 --> 23:12.416
You mean, like, online or something?

23:12.441 --> 23:14.203
Now, I've been looking into amateur nights.

23:14.205 --> 23:16.639
There's a contest that
I saw online in Decatur.

23:16.641 --> 23:18.274
There's industry people there.

23:18.276 --> 23:19.475
Managers, too.

23:19.477 --> 23:21.344
You have to trust me on this.

23:22.414 --> 23:26.015
When did you say the contest was?

23:26.017 --> 23:28.518
It's tonight.

23:28.520 --> 23:32.422
Which means we need to get cute after work.

23:36.401 --> 23:38.019
Get off the damn stage!

23:38.044 --> 23:39.944
Put-put the mikes down,
please. Put the mike...

23:39.969 --> 23:41.268
It's... This ain't for you.

23:41.270 --> 23:43.494
This rap thing ain't for you.

23:43.519 --> 23:45.205
Ladies and gentlemen, the next act

23:45.207 --> 23:46.540
we're gonna bring to the stage is

23:46.542 --> 23:48.542
three young ladies who
traveled a long way Simone.

23:48.544 --> 23:50.544
To be here with us.
Give it up for Alexandra,

23:50.546 --> 23:52.280
Simone, and Star,

23:52.305 --> 23:54.815
or as their initials spell out, ASS.

By the way, Alexandra, where
were all the managers tonight?

24:59.648 --> 25:01.715
We need to keep at it.

25:01.717 --> 25:04.017
No. We did it your way.

25:04.019 --> 25:05.753
Now we're gonna do it my way.

25:05.755 --> 25:09.022
And how do
you suggest we do that?

25:09.024 --> 25:13.994
I know where to find a manager
on a Saturday night in Atlanta.

25:13.996 --> 25:17.264
He's throwing dollar bills
at some poor girl's ass.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.832
No.

25:18.834 --> 25:20.388
We cannot go-go in Atlanta.

25:20.413 --> 25:23.170
Girl, the important men ain't
at no go-go bars anyway.

25:23.172 --> 25:25.523
I'm confused about where
you just came from.

25:25.548 --> 25:28.709
And I know you ain't think that y'all
was about to win at that dump.

25:28.711 --> 25:30.477
- Wait, you saw us?
- Yeah, I saw y'all.

25:30.479 --> 25:33.280
I mean, y'all are, y'all okay.

25:33.282 --> 25:35.449
But are you really looking for a manager?

25:35.451 --> 25:36.717
- Yes.
- Yeah.

25:36.719 --> 25:38.085
They at the strip club. I know one.

25:38.087 --> 25:41.288
I work there.
And it's full of industry people.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.663
How you know that?

25:42.688 --> 25:44.291
Baby, 'cause I'm connected.

25:44.293 --> 25:46.326
You know, in certain ways.

25:46.328 --> 25:48.099
- Well, connect me!
- No.

25:48.124 --> 25:50.391
No strip club. No way.

25:50.416 --> 25:52.733
She's sort of right. I will go-go,

25:52.735 --> 25:54.835
but I don't show my cash and prizes.

25:54.837 --> 25:56.370
You won't have to. I can get you

25:56.372 --> 25:58.105
in the champagne room. And that way

25:58.107 --> 25:59.740
You can set your own limit.

25:59.742 --> 26:00.974
But don't tell

26:00.976 --> 26:02.943
my mama. That bitch is crazy.

26:02.945 --> 26:06.447
Well, actually, we have
to think of our future.

26:06.449 --> 26:07.581
What if someone photographs you?

26:07.583 --> 26:08.933
- Then what?
- So what if they do?

26:08.958 --> 26:12.396
Okay, okay. Look at Kim Kardashian.

26:12.421 --> 26:14.121
I love her. And she showed

26:14.123 --> 26:16.790
every hole in her body.
And now she's famous.

26:16.792 --> 26:19.059
- Genius.
- Wow.

26:19.061 --> 26:21.061
- Truly genius.
- Okay.

26:21.063 --> 26:22.963
- She's right, and I'm in.
- Of course.

26:22.965 --> 26:24.898
Okay, well, I'm too tired to strip,

26:24.900 --> 26:27.734
and I'm hungry. So...

26:27.736 --> 26:29.336
see you at home.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.371
Okay. You know what?

26:31.373 --> 26:32.639
Just watch her.

26:32.641 --> 26:34.074
- You are not...
- Yeah, th-that's

26:34.076 --> 26:35.509
- all you got to do.
- You watch it.

26:35.511 --> 26:37.678
- You watch her, and I'll strip
- Star.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.713
- For the both of us. Come on, girl.
- Star.

26:39.715 --> 26:42.182
- Come on. Come on.
- One cheek, two cheek,

26:42.184 --> 26:44.451
both cheek, hey!

26:45.554 --> 26:48.255
Where's Star and Cotton?

26:48.257 --> 26:49.823
They went...

26:49.825 --> 26:51.383
bowling.

26:51.408 --> 26:52.559
"Bowling"?

26:52.561 --> 26:54.428
What you take me for, girl?

26:54.430 --> 26:58.365
What do I do that seems
to get under your skin?

26:59.535 --> 27:02.369
I want what's best for Star and Simone.

27:02.371 --> 27:04.771
What's best for them is
the music we're making.

27:04.773 --> 27:06.073
Have you listened to it?

27:06.075 --> 27:08.443
Have you even asked them about it?

27:08.468 --> 27:11.612
Or about anything else
that matters to them?

27:11.614 --> 27:14.214
Like how you were too
unfit to take care of them.

27:15.479 --> 27:17.618
I read those letters you sent.

27:17.620 --> 27:19.745
Trying to be big mama now.

27:19.770 --> 27:21.870
I know you're trying to
be something you're not.

27:21.895 --> 27:23.657
You're running from something.

27:23.659 --> 27:25.826
And you're using Simone
and Star to do it.

27:25.828 --> 27:27.160
You know what?

27:27.162 --> 27:29.196
I'm done with this goat hair.

27:29.198 --> 27:31.164
Keep it up with your fresh ass.

27:37.706 --> 27:41.141
So you're gonna be living
next door to me, huh?

27:41.143 --> 27:44.244
I'm so done with this place.

27:46.882 --> 27:49.383
I never got your name.

27:49.385 --> 27:52.319
That's because I never told you my name.

27:52.321 --> 27:55.188
Why you got to be so rude?

27:58.027 --> 28:00.594
It's Alexandra.

28:02.898 --> 28:05.599
You really think you
can change the world?

28:06.802 --> 28:09.236
You see how crazy it is in these streets?

28:10.706 --> 28:12.105
How they treating us?

28:20.950 --> 28:24.284
I think I can make people's lives better.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.320
I plan to do that with my music.

28:26.322 --> 28:27.821
Your music, huh?

28:30.826 --> 28:32.593
Alexandra, why don't you come over here

28:32.595 --> 28:33.961
so I can make you feel better.

28:33.963 --> 28:36.463
Ew.

28:36.465 --> 28:39.032
Can't you think of a better pickup line?

28:39.034 --> 28:41.868
Get over here.

28:41.870 --> 28:44.571
No, you get over here.

28:44.573 --> 28:46.940
Okay.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.981
Girl, I really feel like I
got a camel toe in this thing.

28:53.983 --> 28:55.582
Girl, it's the only thing in my locker

28:55.584 --> 28:57.551
that would've fit your little ass.

28:57.553 --> 28:58.785
Let me see.

28:58.787 --> 29:02.255
Girl, shut up, you look good. Come on.

29:02.257 --> 29:04.257
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

29:04.259 --> 29:06.660
Ooh, I think that's one
of 'em right there.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.659
Girl, that's a big fish, bitch,
talent manager.

29:08.660 --> 29:09.573
Okay.

29:09.598 --> 29:11.798
- Well, he's with somebody. What do we do?
- Not for long, okay?

29:11.800 --> 29:13.467
I'm about to get that
bitch up out of here.

29:13.469 --> 29:15.602
Come on, wait for my cue.

29:18.407 --> 29:20.240
Hey, girl, Michelle,
I need to talk to you.

29:20.242 --> 29:22.409
- Can't you see I'm making my money?
- Tisha just called.

29:22.411 --> 29:24.478
Your mama's diabetes is kicking in.

29:24.480 --> 29:27.180
Bitch, you better not be lying.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.248
For real.

29:28.250 --> 29:32.019
I'll be back. Come on.

29:35.224 --> 29:37.290
I want you out back.

29:40.029 --> 29:42.663
Oh, no. I-I'm good, baby.

29:42.665 --> 29:43.897
I'm with Michelle.

29:43.899 --> 29:46.166
Oh, you don't want Michelle.
She got syphilis.

29:46.168 --> 29:48.001
- Syphilis?
- That's what she just went to tell her.

29:48.003 --> 29:50.537
Yeah, come with me to the champagne room.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.439
- Come here.
- What you mean, syphilis?

29:52.441 --> 29:54.541
Come on.

29:54.543 --> 29:57.911
♪ I bring me, get mine, 'bout mine ♪

29:57.913 --> 30:00.280
♪ Go hard, looking for another like me ♪

31:42.618 --> 31:45.152
You're trouble.

31:45.154 --> 31:47.387
Sometimes.

31:47.389 --> 31:49.990
I have an idea. All right?

31:49.992 --> 31:52.993
- Okay.
- I'm putting together

31:52.995 --> 31:55.929
the entertainment for this
party at Hunter Morgan's house.

31:55.931 --> 31:57.664
He's a good friend of mine.

31:57.666 --> 32:02.135
You sing at it like you did just now...

32:03.806 --> 32:06.106
Girl, I'm gonna have to take you on.

32:06.108 --> 32:08.074
But I'm a package deal.

32:08.076 --> 32:10.076
Two other girls.

32:10.078 --> 32:11.845
We're a girl group.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.980
All right.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.550
Take this.

32:16.552 --> 32:18.185
Call me in the morning.

32:19.087 --> 32:21.188
Maybe we'll discuss it.

32:23.759 --> 32:24.958
Cotton!

32:24.960 --> 32:27.360
Damn it, where are you?

32:27.362 --> 32:30.263
Oh, my God!

32:30.265 --> 32:31.398
What are you doing to her?!

32:33.468 --> 32:34.734
You want to fight, bitch?

32:35.771 --> 32:37.170
Leave her alone!

32:37.172 --> 32:39.239
Leave him alone!

32:39.241 --> 32:42.271
This black freak needs to
tell people what's down there!

32:42.296 --> 32:44.869
You knew exactly what was down there.

32:47.249 --> 32:49.950
Get your money.

32:55.424 --> 32:58.658
I knew there was something
I liked about you.

32:58.660 --> 33:01.542
And you were right.

33:01.567 --> 33:02.996
I caught that big fish.

33:06.138 --> 33:07.896
- I'm getting ready to drop her.
- Why?

33:07.921 --> 33:09.751
From coming... Because she's always late

33:09.776 --> 33:10.775
and she likes to sit and blame it

33:10.777 --> 33:12.243
on them badass kids of hers.

33:12.245 --> 33:14.479
- I can't take her.
- I know where you took Star last night.

33:14.481 --> 33:16.347
We just went out dancing at the...

33:16.349 --> 33:17.448
What happened to your eye?

33:17.450 --> 33:18.850
Nothin'.

33:18.852 --> 33:21.463
Mama, we was just at the club dancing.

33:21.488 --> 33:22.455
That's it.

33:22.480 --> 33:25.333
You better not be
doing what I think you're doing.

33:25.358 --> 33:28.092
Mama, we was just at the club.

33:28.094 --> 33:29.394
Stop lying, boy.

33:29.396 --> 33:31.930
Girl, Mama.

33:31.932 --> 33:33.665
Wait, Cotton's a boy?

33:33.667 --> 33:35.300
Girl, Miss Simone, if you don't wake up.

33:35.302 --> 33:37.835
- That ain't hard to figure out.
- Stop hatin', Miss Bruce.

33:37.837 --> 33:39.938
- Girl, I... girl. I'm not...
- 'Cause I can pass, unlike your ugly ass.

33:39.940 --> 33:41.706
If you could pass, sweetie...

33:41.708 --> 33:43.775
You turtle-headed-looking bitch.

33:43.777 --> 33:45.610
- You're a delusional gentleman.
- I'll staple that...

33:45.612 --> 33:48.212
Stop all that cussing in my house!

33:51.351 --> 33:55.019
Look, you want to be a woman, a'ight.

33:55.021 --> 33:57.188
I ain't got no problem with it.

33:57.190 --> 33:59.223
But I know what goes on in that club.

33:59.225 --> 34:00.458
I ain't new to the game.

34:00.460 --> 34:03.661
Mama, we found a manager
while we was down there.

34:03.663 --> 34:05.063
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait, Star.

34:05.065 --> 34:06.770
For real, you got a manager?

34:06.795 --> 34:08.900
He's in charge of the
entertainment at the house party

34:08.902 --> 34:11.101
for Hunter Morgan.

34:11.103 --> 34:12.704
That famous NFL player.

34:12.706 --> 34:14.472
He said we could sing at it.

34:14.474 --> 34:16.574
And if we do good, he's gonna sign us.

34:16.576 --> 34:21.194
So, who exactly is this manager
you found at a strip joint?

34:21.219 --> 34:22.886
Jahil Rivera.

34:22.911 --> 34:24.610
Oh.

34:25.851 --> 34:28.553
Damn, how you...?

34:28.554 --> 34:30.288
Girl, I can't.

34:30.290 --> 34:32.657
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Where
are all the pretty people at?

34:38.598 --> 34:40.565
- What are you doing here?
- What, I can't

34:40.567 --> 34:43.801
- come see my godson?
- Jahil, my man. What's good?

34:43.803 --> 34:45.370
- Looking good, baby.
- You know, just doing

34:45.371 --> 34:46.871
what I got to do, right?

34:46.873 --> 34:48.005
Where you been?

34:48.007 --> 34:49.568
Yeah. Where have you been?

34:49.592 --> 34:51.643
I'm glad you asked. Check this out.

34:51.645 --> 34:52.844
I got a new act.

34:52.846 --> 34:55.213
I got these three girls...
Amazing singers, man.

34:55.215 --> 34:57.749
I want to add them to
the lineup at your party.

34:57.751 --> 34:59.150
Come on, man, that last group?

34:59.152 --> 34:59.825
Who?

34:59.850 --> 35:02.553
Ma, what was that last group?

35:02.555 --> 35:04.522
The Koreans.

35:04.524 --> 35:05.657
Yeah,

35:05.659 --> 35:06.758
the Koreans.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.459
- I'm embarrassed.
- No. Hey, hey,

35:08.461 --> 35:09.861
look, look, no, this...

35:09.863 --> 35:10.862
this ain't that, okay?

35:10.864 --> 35:12.330
These girls, they're talented.

35:12.332 --> 35:14.165
Come on, Hunter, it's one song, man.

35:14.167 --> 35:16.100
Just do me a solid.

35:16.870 --> 35:18.036
Ma?

35:18.038 --> 35:20.505
♪ I can be ya hip-hop ♪

35:20.507 --> 35:21.773
♪ Bulletproof vest ♪

35:21.775 --> 35:23.941
♪ I can be the tattoo
bleeding on ya chest... ♪

35:23.943 --> 35:24.909
I can't do this.

35:24.911 --> 35:26.411
- What?
- We should not be singing

35:26.413 --> 35:28.980
"I Can Be," we should be
singing "Break Yo Chest."

35:28.982 --> 35:30.348
Are you kidding me?

35:30.350 --> 35:31.537
That's the one that the crowd will like.

35:31.561 --> 35:35.145
No, "I Can Be" is much further
along sonically and lyrically.

35:36.156 --> 35:38.723
Simone, where have you been?

35:38.725 --> 35:40.758
And what are you wearing?

35:40.760 --> 35:44.529
It's my church outfit.
Miss Carlotta gave it to me.

35:44.531 --> 35:47.198
Simone, we've been rehearsing for hours.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.537
Chill. I'm already warmed
up from choir practice now.

35:49.562 --> 35:50.468
Miss Carlotta says

35:50.470 --> 35:52.236
singing for the Lord could save me.

35:52.238 --> 35:53.871
Miss Carlotta says

35:53.873 --> 35:56.741
singing for the Lord
could save all of us.

35:57.644 --> 35:59.277
Star...

35:59.279 --> 36:01.145
let's get saved.

36:02.348 --> 36:05.183
There's something wrong with you, Simone.

36:07.134 --> 36:09.218
Ain't nothin' wrong with me.

36:10.726 --> 36:12.118
Miss Carlotta really loves us, Star.

36:12.142 --> 36:13.461
She wants to be our new mother.

36:13.486 --> 36:15.993
I'm a little over new
mothers, aren't you?

36:15.995 --> 36:17.814
You're not singing in anybody's choir.

36:17.839 --> 36:21.608
And the only person who's
gonna save us is that manager.

36:22.961 --> 36:25.228
Where's my weed?

36:25.253 --> 36:26.151
Oh, my God.

36:26.176 --> 36:27.905
Star, this is getting nuts.

36:27.907 --> 36:28.940
It's okay.

36:28.942 --> 36:31.342
It's cool.

36:32.345 --> 36:35.079
You ain't got to worry about me.

36:35.081 --> 36:38.182
All that stuff in the past is in the past.

36:43.823 --> 36:46.157
Working from home now?

36:54.300 --> 36:56.100
We made an agreement.

36:56.102 --> 36:57.735
I kept my part.

37:01.708 --> 37:03.541
About what?

37:04.203 --> 37:05.369
Huh?

37:06.980 --> 37:09.247
You're tangling in my life again,

37:09.249 --> 37:11.082
and I'm not having it.

37:13.653 --> 37:15.486
That's Mary's kid.

37:15.488 --> 37:16.621
Who?

37:16.623 --> 37:18.055
Star.

37:22.162 --> 37:24.061
Damn.

37:27.767 --> 37:30.067
The minute I heard that girl sing,

37:30.069 --> 37:33.571
it made me feel exactly the way
I felt when I first heard Mary.

37:33.573 --> 37:35.740
I'm not interested in your feelings.

37:35.742 --> 37:38.910
I'm interested in how you
can afford $10,000 watches.

37:38.912 --> 37:41.913
I know this is all smoke and mirrors.

37:41.915 --> 37:44.048
You sitting on money in Peru.

37:44.050 --> 37:46.417
I think Star could learn a lot from you.

37:46.419 --> 37:48.152
She's good. Lottie,
I'm telling you right now,

37:48.154 --> 37:50.388
she's really good, and...
if those other girls

37:50.390 --> 37:52.223
are half as talented as she is,

37:52.225 --> 37:54.192
we got the makings of a super group.

37:54.194 --> 37:56.294
You could tell all that to the D.A.,

37:56.296 --> 37:58.329
'cause that's exactly who I'm finna call

37:58.331 --> 38:00.431
if you don't stay away from them.

38:01.868 --> 38:05.203
I killed myself to make you and Mary stars.

38:05.205 --> 38:08.372
I bet everything I had
on you dumb bitches,

38:08.374 --> 38:09.507
and you blew it.

38:09.509 --> 38:11.075
Mary with the drugs, and you...

38:11.077 --> 38:13.811
gaining all that weight,
never showing up on time,

38:13.813 --> 38:15.321
acting like an amateur.

38:15.346 --> 38:16.822
And who paid for that? Me.

38:17.016 --> 38:18.216
My career.

38:18.218 --> 38:20.017
And now you're gonna come up in here,

38:20.019 --> 38:23.054
you're gonna try to derail me again? No.

38:23.056 --> 38:25.356
You know what?

38:25.358 --> 38:27.291
My father always said to me,

38:27.293 --> 38:29.227
you only need three things in life.

38:29.229 --> 38:31.204
Oh, yeah? What did your daddy say.

38:31.229 --> 38:33.162
He said you needed...

38:33.633 --> 38:35.032
your Bible...

38:35.034 --> 38:37.235
your word...

38:37.237 --> 38:39.537
and your gun.

38:47.914 --> 38:50.615
Stay away from those girls.

38:57.788 --> 39:00.349
That drag queen can
sew her little ass off.

39:00.374 --> 39:03.790
She ain't a drag queen,
stupid. She's trans.

39:03.815 --> 39:05.114
We got to hurry.

39:05.139 --> 39:07.469
Carlotta'll be back from
that Bible study any minute.

39:07.471 --> 39:08.636
We gonna slay today.

39:08.638 --> 39:10.338
Yeah, we are. My butt looks good.

39:10.340 --> 39:11.773
It does.

39:11.775 --> 39:13.942
You'll slay if you're sober...

39:13.944 --> 39:15.744
and coherent.

39:17.881 --> 39:19.881
I'm sick of your ass.

39:19.883 --> 39:21.516
- Simone.
- No, I'm sick of her ass.

39:21.518 --> 39:23.118
She thinks she's the boss.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.015
And you think you're the boss,
dragging my ass

39:25.040 --> 39:26.755
- all around Atlanta!
- Dragging your ass?

39:26.757 --> 39:28.490
- Yeah, dragging it.
- I saved your ass.

39:28.492 --> 39:30.558
- Yeah, well, save it now.
- All right, take it easy.

39:30.560 --> 39:31.793
You got two seconds.

39:31.795 --> 39:33.661
Always arguing.

39:36.666 --> 39:39.033
Do you want to change our lives today?

39:43.140 --> 39:45.273
Scooch over.

39:46.343 --> 39:48.610
So, how is that boy?

39:48.612 --> 39:50.578
What boy?

39:51.448 --> 39:52.614
Derek.

39:52.616 --> 39:55.316
Mr. Light-Skinned Matter.

40:00.357 --> 40:02.557
She'll be okay.

40:09.299 --> 40:10.665
Hey!

40:10.667 --> 40:12.066
My man!

40:13.470 --> 40:14.869
I'm Arlene.

40:14.871 --> 40:16.004
His mother.

40:16.006 --> 40:17.572
- It's my house.
- Hunter,

40:17.574 --> 40:18.840
these are the girls I told you about.

40:18.842 --> 40:20.175
That right there is Simone,

40:20.177 --> 40:21.476
this one here is Alexandra,

40:21.478 --> 40:22.911
and that one right there,

40:22.913 --> 40:24.045
that's Star.

40:24.047 --> 40:26.014
You guys are gonna be performing

40:26.016 --> 40:27.315
in the other room.

40:27.317 --> 40:29.584
Anybody want a drink?

40:29.586 --> 40:31.386
A drink wouldn't kill me.

40:31.388 --> 40:33.054
All right, one drink, you hear me?

40:33.056 --> 40:34.773
Then meet me in the living room.

40:34.798 --> 40:36.357
Come here, girl.

40:36.359 --> 40:38.393
- Come on.
- Girl, let me see this.

40:38.395 --> 40:40.228
Hey, I want to see more
of what we got going here.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.363
- Whoa.
- Where's Simone?

40:46.570 --> 40:49.237
This tastes like apple juice.
You got scotch?

40:53.009 --> 40:54.409
I mean...

40:54.411 --> 40:58.847
any jackass can run up and
down a field, toss a ball.

41:00.217 --> 41:02.550
But to sing?

41:02.552 --> 41:05.153
To take someone inside your soul?

41:06.423 --> 41:08.790
Speaking of balls...

41:08.792 --> 41:11.759
you been throwing some
pretty big ones this season.

41:11.761 --> 41:14.229
Oh-ho, I have, have I?

41:15.932 --> 41:18.333
They are pretty big.

41:20.337 --> 41:22.403
Where's your bathroom?

41:22.405 --> 41:24.339
Upstairs.

41:37.654 --> 41:39.654
There's lipstick on my glass.

41:41.998 --> 41:43.989
- What are we gonna do?
- You're gonna help me up.

41:44.014 --> 41:46.027
That's what you're gonna do.
We finna perform.

41:46.029 --> 41:47.262
Come on.

41:47.264 --> 41:49.430
Don't look at me like that.

41:59.242 --> 42:01.709
