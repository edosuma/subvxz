what's real anymore!

18:41.653 --> 18:44.590
<i>- Irving, sweetie,</i>
<i>get me out of this hole!</i>

18:44.656 --> 18:46.391
- Okay,
that's definitely Miriam,

18:46.458 --> 18:48.227
and she's getting really angry,

18:48.293 --> 18:50.028
so I got to go take care
of this.

18:50.095 --> 18:52.097
- But, Dad, it might be a yeti!

18:52.164 --> 18:54.032
{\an3}There's no way
we can know for sure!

18:54.099 --> 18:55.434
- Sure, there is.

18:55.501 --> 18:56.635
It's called
a fully automatic spear gun.

18:56.702 --> 18:57.870
- Holy crud, no!

18:57.936 --> 18:59.371
{\an1}I'm not gonna let you go shoot
my wife!

18:59.438 --> 19:01.440
{\an3}- Look, I'm not gonna
argue with you, Irving.

19:01.507 --> 19:02.741
Rooter!

19:02.808 --> 19:05.911
{\an1}- [grunts]

19:05.978 --> 19:07.279
Britney,
keep an eye on him!

19:07.346 --> 19:08.747
Rooter and Harvey,
you take up positions

19:08.814 --> 19:10.415
by the door and cover me.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.352
Dad, you protect the base and
keep Roger out of the crisps.

19:13.418 --> 19:14.786
{\an3}- Oh, all right.
Very good.

19:14.853 --> 19:17.155
- All right, let's move out!

19:17.222 --> 19:18.757
- Harvey, you gotta
get me out of here!

19:18.824 --> 19:20.025
- Just stay there, Dad!

19:20.092 --> 19:22.261
I'm gonna help keep us safe.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.630
- All right, yeti.
End of the line!

19:24.696 --> 19:26.598
- Mitch, is that you?

19:26.665 --> 19:28.166
- Uh, yes.

19:28.233 --> 19:31.136
- Great. Get me out of here
so that I can strangle Irving.

19:31.203 --> 19:32.838
- I bet you'd like that, yeti.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.207
- Wait, you seriously think
I'm a yeti?

19:35.274 --> 19:36.775
I'm not a yeti, Mitch!

19:36.842 --> 19:38.076
I'm on your mail route!

19:38.143 --> 19:39.545
- What's the matter, Dad?

19:39.611 --> 19:42.281
{\an1}- I've--I've never faced
an actual yeti before.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.515
It's terrifying.

19:43.582 --> 19:45.417
- Don't let it poison your mind!

19:45.484 --> 19:46.685
Strike it down!

19:46.752 --> 19:48.320
- Man, you're intense.

19:48.387 --> 19:49.688
- Right.

19:49.755 --> 19:50.923
- No!

19:50.989 --> 19:54.293
[grunting]

19:55.928 --> 19:57.763
- Aah!

19:57.829 --> 19:59.965
[yelps]
Aw, biscuits.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.567
- I can't believe that worked.

20:01.633 --> 20:03.101
{\an3}- Hold on, Dad.
I'll get you out.

20:03.168 --> 20:04.803
- No, son, you can't!

20:04.870 --> 20:08.307
If I'm down here in the yeti
trap, you know what that means.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.975
{\an3}- [gasps]
What are you saying?

20:10.042 --> 20:13.412
- Son, I must be a yeti!

20:13.478 --> 20:17.015
{\an3}- No!
Not my own father!

20:17.082 --> 20:18.750
- Oh, very good, then.

20:18.817 --> 20:19.985
- No, Grandpa, wait!

20:20.052 --> 20:21.887
- Ah!
[all yelp]

20:21.954 --> 20:23.255
- Aw, crackers!

20:23.322 --> 20:24.656
{\an1}It looks like
the whole lot of us are yetis.

20:25.824 --> 20:28.126
- They were all yetis
this whole time.

20:28.193 --> 20:30.395
Everybody is yetis!

20:30.462 --> 20:32.431
{\an3}- All right, Harvey.
They're distracted. Get me down!

20:32.497 --> 20:35.100
- I bet you'd like that, yeti.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.535
{\an3}- [yelps]
What are you doing?

20:36.602 --> 20:39.304
- Any last words,
you shape-shifting monster?

20:39.371 --> 20:41.139
- Harvey, I'm not a yeti.

20:41.206 --> 20:42.407
I'm your father.

20:42.474 --> 20:43.976
I cried when you hatched.

20:44.042 --> 20:45.477
I know the tag on your underwear

20:45.544 --> 20:47.613
has "TH" written on it
because it's Thursday.

20:47.679 --> 20:49.581
I know that sometimes
you sneak into my room

20:49.648 --> 20:53.185
and remake my bed because
you think it could be better.

20:53.251 --> 20:55.320
Harvey, I'm not a monster.

20:55.387 --> 20:58.156
I'm your father who loves you
and is sorry

20:58.223 --> 21:01.560
he got you wrapped up in this.

21:01.627 --> 21:02.794
Ah!

21:02.861 --> 21:05.197
Hey! Oof.

21:05.263 --> 21:06.999
- I'm so sorry, Dad.

21:07.065 --> 21:08.500
{\an1}I don't know
what happened to me.

21:08.567 --> 21:11.103
{\an3}- I think this kind of place
makes everybody nuts.

21:11.169 --> 21:12.404
Let's get out of here.

21:12.471 --> 21:14.006
{\an1}- All right,
well, let's get out of here.

21:14.072 --> 21:16.575
{\an1}Rooter, we'll use our
yeti strength to throw you out.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.677
{\an1}Heave ho!

21:20.112 --> 21:21.546
- [grunts]

21:21.613 --> 21:24.049
Now what do we do, Dad?
Fall back to the bunker?

21:24.116 --> 21:25.817
- No, we're yetis now, okay?

21:25.884 --> 21:28.353
{\an1}Yetis don't live
in a yeti-proof bunker.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.155
Come, into the forest!

21:30.222 --> 21:34.493
We're gonna find the yeti hive
and report back to the queen!

21:34.559 --> 21:37.562
- Roger,
live your yeti-free life.

21:37.629 --> 21:41.266
Live, Roger!
Live for us.

21:43.068 --> 21:46.772
- Rooter's family
is really, um...

21:46.838 --> 21:48.273
- Colorful?
- Yeah.

21:48.340 --> 21:50.108
{\an3}- [sighs]
I'm just glad we aren't living

21:50.175 --> 21:51.576
in constant fear anymore.

21:51.643 --> 21:54.880
- Irving Beaks!

21:54.946 --> 21:56.715
{\an3}- Oh.
Hey, honey.

21:56.782 --> 21:59.718
So...how was work?
