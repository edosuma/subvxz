WEBVTT

00:04.700 --> 00:05.048
.

00:05.092 --> 00:07.268
<i>- Previously
on "New Amsterdam"... </i>

00:07.311 --> 00:08.704
- Why'd you tell everyone
we were a couple?

00:08.747 --> 00:10.488
- Yeah, okay, look--
- We agreed

00:10.532 --> 00:12.142
you were going to treat me
like everyone else.

00:12.186 --> 00:15.537
- As your newly minted
psych residency director,

00:15.580 --> 00:17.800
you will be on this ward
with real patients,

00:17.843 --> 00:20.281
and you will have me
in supervision as your teacher.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.847
- You and your girl
work things out?

00:21.891 --> 00:25.547
- We did, but still
figuring out some details.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.810
- You want someone
to replace Dr. Sharpe.

00:27.853 --> 00:30.856
Something tells me Dr. Sharpe
is not replaceable.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.858
Don't let her go.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.209
- Did you find my replacement?
- I'm going with you.

01:10.331 --> 01:14.335
<i>-  Once upon a hilltop  </i>

01:14.378 --> 01:16.163
<i>-  It's one for you  </i>

01:16.206 --> 01:19.296
<i> Three  </i>

01:27.174 --> 01:31.352
<i> This far  </i>

01:44.669 --> 01:47.716
- Oh, God, I forgot
to ask what Brantley said

01:47.759 --> 01:49.761
when you told her
that you were leaving.

01:49.805 --> 01:50.849
- Brantley?
I'm sorry, who's Brantley?

01:50.893 --> 01:52.721
I'm not familiar.
- Aw, Max.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.549
- I'm gonna tell her.
I'm gonna tell her, I just--

01:54.592 --> 01:56.333
I'm just trying to have
my replacement all lined up,

01:56.377 --> 01:58.466
because I don't want to give
her a full-blown heart attack.

01:58.509 --> 01:59.597
- Oh, wow.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.251
Sparing Brantley's heart
palpitations

02:01.295 --> 02:03.253
have never been a top priority
for you before.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.516
- Better late than never?

02:05.560 --> 02:06.952
- Okay.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.867
And what about
Luna's grandparents?

02:08.911 --> 02:09.912
Do they know?

02:11.305 --> 02:13.611
- I'm working on it.

02:13.655 --> 02:15.222
- We leave in six weeks.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.875
- Okay, Helen, come here,
come here, come here.

02:16.919 --> 02:19.704
I am gonna tell them, okay?

02:19.748 --> 02:22.577
I'm gonna tell everyone.
I'm gonna tell strangers.

02:22.620 --> 02:25.667
Maybe even tomorrow,
but not tonight.

02:26.842 --> 02:31.281
Because tonight, all I want...

02:31.325 --> 02:33.457
is dim sum...

02:33.501 --> 02:35.546
in bed...

02:35.590 --> 02:36.939
with you.

02:42.031 --> 02:45.556
- You are going
to get dim sum...

02:45.600 --> 02:47.341
- Really?
- And then some...

02:47.384 --> 02:48.690
- Ooh.

02:48.733 --> 02:51.432
- Once you tell everyone.
- Oh, I see.

02:53.390 --> 02:54.696
Bye.
- Have a good day.

02:54.739 --> 02:55.827
- Hear ye!

02:55.871 --> 02:57.960
It is that time of year again,
folks.

02:58.003 --> 03:00.310
It is the Harvest Festival
tonight at the rooftop garden.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.660
Please join me for free drinks.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.401
The broccoli is coming in hot.

03:04.445 --> 03:06.011
Oh, yeah,
she just turned it down flat.

03:06.055 --> 03:08.797
Casey, have you ever seen
such ripe, tender heads

03:08.840 --> 03:10.494
pressed up against one another
like that?

03:10.538 --> 03:12.322
- What?
- The thing, man, tonight.

03:12.366 --> 03:13.758
You coming?

03:13.802 --> 03:15.499
- Yo, if I give you some of
the best gossip ever,

03:15.543 --> 03:16.500
can I skip it?

03:16.544 --> 03:17.501
- No.
- Come on!

03:17.545 --> 03:18.894
Damn it, I gotta tell somebody.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.287
It's just too good.

03:20.330 --> 03:24.639
I just saw Max and Helen
totally making out

03:24.682 --> 03:26.510
over by the ambulance bay.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.687
- But no, they're--
yeah, they're friends.

03:29.731 --> 03:32.255
They're good friends.
- Yeah, that were suckin' face.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.691
- They're overly physical
communicators.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.519
They talk with their hands.
- Are you telling me

03:35.563 --> 03:39.523
that you had never any idea
what was going on between them?

03:39.567 --> 03:41.743
- Casey, although it
is a blessing and a curse,

03:41.786 --> 03:44.441
behavioral analysis
is my superpower, okay?

03:44.485 --> 03:46.574
If there was ever
any romantic inclination

03:46.617 --> 03:47.836
between Max and Helen,

03:47.879 --> 03:49.533
I'd have been the first
to suss is out.

03:49.577 --> 03:50.926
- Okay? Now just shush.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.320
Come tonight. Eat broccoli.

03:53.363 --> 03:56.279
- I...

04:03.721 --> 04:06.898
- Thanks for the lift,
best boss ever.

04:06.942 --> 04:08.944
- Yeah,
well, don't thank me just yet.

04:08.987 --> 04:11.903
Uh, Iggy is having his weird
harvest thing tonight,

04:11.947 --> 04:13.383
and as your awful girlfriend,

04:13.427 --> 04:15.559
I am forcing you
to be my plus-one.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.953
- Sounds great!
- Does it though?

04:22.914 --> 04:26.440
- Good morning, Dr. Malvo.

04:26.483 --> 04:29.791
- Morning, Dr. Reynolds.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.140
What's with the smile?

04:31.183 --> 04:34.883
- Oh, I guess my00 a.m.
spinal fusion surgery

04:34.926 --> 04:38.016
has got me really,
really happy.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.018
- Ah, well,
that would sound strange,

04:40.062 --> 04:42.847
but suddenly
I find myself very excited

04:42.891 --> 04:45.894
about my...pelvic laparoscopy.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.765
- Mm.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.332
- Assuming you'll walk with me.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.769
- I passed my elevator
about 30 seconds ago.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.467
- I'll try
to keep you entertained.

04:53.510 --> 04:56.948
- Well, you set the bar
really high last night.

04:56.992 --> 04:59.908
- You more than cleared it.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.736
I have a few hours after work,

05:01.779 --> 05:04.652
and maybe if you're free,
we can...

05:06.697 --> 05:08.830
- You just can't get enough,
can you?

05:12.486 --> 05:15.358
What's up?

05:15.402 --> 05:17.926
- I'm late for my surgery.

05:20.015 --> 05:22.757
- Yo, what'd I say?

05:26.848 --> 05:28.371
- It's unclear
if you know this,

05:28.415 --> 05:30.591
but I am actually
a very busy surgeon.

05:30.634 --> 05:34.551
- Well,
I have a job offer for you.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.118
- But I already said no.
- Not to the job

05:36.161 --> 05:37.511
I'm about to offer,
and spoiler alert,

05:37.554 --> 05:40.514
it is the best job
that we've got.

05:40.557 --> 05:43.430
- What's better
than the chair of oncology?

05:43.473 --> 05:45.127
- Medical director
of New Amsterdam.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.172
- Uh!

05:47.216 --> 05:48.652
No.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.959
- No.
- No?

05:51.002 --> 05:53.135
- And, had I known this is why
you wanted to meet again,

05:53.178 --> 05:54.789
I would have
saved you the trouble.

05:54.832 --> 05:57.835
- Um, maybe you're--
maybe you're in shock

05:57.879 --> 06:00.838
at being offered
the very prestigious position

06:00.882 --> 06:01.926
of medical director

06:01.970 --> 06:04.538
at America's first
public hospital?

06:04.581 --> 06:07.018
<i>- Dr. Luke to neonatal.
Dr. Luke to neonatal. </i>

06:07.062 --> 06:09.630
- Nah, I feel pretty
levelheaded about it.

06:09.673 --> 06:13.024
- Would you...
would you tell me why?

06:13.068 --> 06:15.853
Because I killed for this job.
I mean, I love this job.

06:15.897 --> 06:18.203
This is the greatest job
in the entire world.

06:18.247 --> 06:20.554
- Catastrophic emergency, Max!

06:21.903 --> 06:23.731
- That's your answer,
in a nutshell.

06:23.774 --> 06:25.080
- Makes sense.

06:25.123 --> 06:26.864
Okay, would you do me
a professional courtesy

06:26.908 --> 06:28.083
and just think about it

06:28.126 --> 06:29.867
and take the day
and get back to me maybe?

06:29.911 --> 06:31.565
Maybe?
- Max!

06:31.608 --> 06:33.044
- Okay!
Go.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.872
- Yes?
- Go, go. I'll think about it.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.657
- Thank you.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.789
- What was that about?
- Uh, I'm not sure.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.749
- Oh, Max,
why didn't you just tell me?

06:42.793 --> 06:44.621
- Oh.
Um, I don't know.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.232
I was just looking
for the right time, and, uh--

06:47.276 --> 06:48.973
- It's our ICU, Max.
If it's understaffed,

06:49.017 --> 06:51.193
I need to know before something
like this happens.

06:51.236 --> 06:52.716
- Right.
You're talking about our ICU.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.239
Totally makes sense.
I completely agree.

06:54.283 --> 06:55.545
We are understaffed.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.025
We should have five attendings
per shift.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.330
We're barely
getting by with two.

06:58.374 --> 07:00.681
- And now those two,
Dr. Perez and Dr. Agata,

07:00.724 --> 07:02.073
are down with food poisoning.
- Oh.

07:02.117 --> 07:03.466
- And there's no backup,
no one to cover.

07:03.510 --> 07:06.513
- So you're saying
no one's running our ICU?

07:08.645 --> 07:10.647
This is why I keep telling you
we need more doctors, Karen.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.083
COVID burnout is real.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.563
- You'd think they have
more sense of duty

07:13.607 --> 07:15.565
to this hospital
than to just leave.

07:15.609 --> 07:17.698
- Well, it's not just about
sense of duty to the hospital.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.482
I mean, these people face
all kinds of stress

07:19.526 --> 07:21.571
for this hospital; they've had
to question every priority,

07:21.615 --> 07:23.051
every value they've ever had.

07:23.094 --> 07:24.966
Not to mention, some of 'em
fell in love, you know.

07:25.009 --> 07:27.185
Finally put love first
for once

07:27.229 --> 07:30.232
instead of denying it for so...

07:30.275 --> 07:32.539
well, maybe, I don't know.

07:32.582 --> 07:34.758
Uh, we need doctors.
That's what I'm saying.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.107
<i>- Triage nurse to the ER...</i>

07:36.151 --> 07:38.588
- We have 22 patients,
two transfers on the way,

07:38.632 --> 07:41.939
at least nine procedures
piling up on the to-do list--

07:41.983 --> 07:44.638
oh, right, and no doctors.
- Then shut it down.

07:44.681 --> 07:45.943
Send these patients
to other hospitals.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.249
- No. They're too sick.

07:47.292 --> 07:49.033
Some of them won't
even survive transport.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.774
- Can't we farm them out
to other areas of the hospital?

07:50.818 --> 07:53.124
- No, they need the specialized
care they can only get here.

07:53.168 --> 07:55.170
If this ICU fails,
the whole hospital goes down.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.693
We gotta make this work.

07:56.737 --> 07:59.043
- How?
Who's gonna take over?

07:59.087 --> 08:01.002
- I will.

08:03.831 --> 08:04.222
.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.834
- Somebody help us over here.
- What happened?

08:06.877 --> 08:08.052
- We were out fishing
to celebrate his retirement.

08:08.096 --> 08:09.401
- Bluefish, stripers,
some tuna.

08:09.445 --> 08:10.620
- Terry, they don't give
a damn about the fish.

08:10.664 --> 08:11.839
- You never know
what's important.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.536
- We go every year.
- We get all set up.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.233
Nice new hooks and everything--
- Terry, for the love of God.

08:15.277 --> 08:16.626
- And when we got to the dock,
all of a sudden

08:16.670 --> 08:18.323
Joe just stops talking.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.542
- Okay.
- Which is alarming,

08:19.586 --> 08:21.544
because Joe never shuts up,
like, never.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.546
It's like the man
gets paid by the word.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.244
No offense, buddy.
- He's gonna be okay, right?

08:26.288 --> 08:27.811
- Hey, Joe, do me a favor.
Can you lift your right arm?

08:27.855 --> 08:30.118
- Is it numb? Is it tingly?

08:30.161 --> 08:31.423
- Yeah, it looks like
he's having a stroke.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.513
Let's get him a CT scan.

08:37.734 --> 08:40.563
- Do you sell what you steal?

08:40.607 --> 08:42.522
- No.
- So why steal at all?

08:43.827 --> 08:46.090
- I don't know.

08:46.134 --> 08:49.703
The things I take,
I don't even want 'em.

08:49.746 --> 08:55.317
It's crazy, but in my head,
it's not stealing.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.494
- But Kevin,
where's the empathy?

08:58.538 --> 09:01.366
You are stealing.

09:01.410 --> 09:04.631
Imagine if it
were someone you loved.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.415
What if you stole
from your dad?

09:06.458 --> 09:08.243
<i>- All right, I'm gonna
pause you right there. </i>

09:08.286 --> 09:10.332
Uh, Miguel, amazing.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.639
Great job bringing Klepto Kevin
to life, man, killin' it.

09:12.682 --> 09:16.338
<i>- Oh, gosh,
it's such a great role. </i>

09:16.381 --> 09:17.731
- You were born to play it,
clearly.

09:17.774 --> 09:19.776
Chitto, I'm sorry
I cut you off back there,

09:19.820 --> 09:21.604
but there was a big-time
tactical error

09:21.648 --> 09:23.214
that we need to talk about.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.913
- But he was opening up.
- No, yeah, I realize that.

09:25.956 --> 09:28.219
But try not to focus
on what he was saying,

09:28.263 --> 09:29.525
more on how he was saying it--

09:29.569 --> 09:31.875
his voice,
his demeanor, his tears.

09:31.919 --> 09:34.356
<i>Does all that suggest a lack
of empathy? </i>

09:34.399 --> 09:36.488
- Crap.
No.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.099
- Yeah.
Also, in last week's reading,

09:38.142 --> 09:40.928
we hit on the common parental
archetypes of kleptomaniacs,

09:40.971 --> 09:44.192
and the big one was...

09:44.235 --> 09:46.586
<i>- Withholding parents.
- Exactly, withholding parents.</i>

09:46.629 --> 09:48.370
So
when you're withholding empathy

09:48.413 --> 09:50.502
and shaming him for his dad,
in Kevin's mind,

09:50.546 --> 09:52.287
guess who you are?

09:52.330 --> 09:54.550
His dad.
Okay?

09:54.594 --> 09:55.899
Good luck
building that trust back.

09:55.943 --> 09:59.642
This is--
this is transference 101, yeah?

09:59.686 --> 10:01.339
Okay.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.254
Oh.
All right, guys, come on.

10:03.298 --> 10:04.473
Let's lose the long faces.

10:04.516 --> 10:05.605
Getting adjustments is good,

10:05.648 --> 10:07.171
as long as take
what you learn here

10:07.215 --> 10:08.825
and you apply it
to your real-life patients.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.784
All right?
That goes for everybody.

10:10.827 --> 10:14.178
So why don't we move past
these, um...

10:14.222 --> 10:18.313
these rookie mistakes and,
uh, crush one?

10:18.356 --> 10:20.707
Miguel, ready to drop in,
find your center?

10:20.750 --> 10:22.317
Chitto?

10:22.360 --> 10:24.406
Take two. Go.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.801
<i>- Kevin, I think--</i>

10:27.844 --> 10:30.281
- Okay, I'm gonna
jump in right here.

10:30.325 --> 10:33.676
- Have you considered-- <i>
- No, not--not quite.</i>

10:35.591 --> 10:37.811
<i>No! Oh, no!
Mamma mia, no. </i>

10:37.854 --> 10:40.814
That was definitely...
a choice.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.946
Guys, guys, come on.
Listen.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.339
Listen to one another.

10:44.382 --> 10:45.688
No, no, no, no, no.

10:45.732 --> 10:48.648
Definitely not that.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.999
<i>Cut!
Nope, change tact. </i>

10:52.042 --> 10:53.348
Mm, no, okay, that's it.
That's it.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.742
That's enough.
Stop.

10:55.785 --> 10:58.614
<i>- Any notes for me?
- No, Miguel.</i>

10:58.658 --> 10:59.789
You're perfection.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.794
- Heart attack during
a symphony concert last night.

11:04.838 --> 11:07.362
- And this bruise?
- Oh, I fell out of my chair

11:07.405 --> 11:10.365
when the chest pain hit.

11:10.408 --> 11:11.932
Oboist screamed.
- Oh.

11:11.975 --> 11:14.543
And people say
symphonies are dull.

11:14.586 --> 11:16.893
- She's had several waves
of chest pain overnight.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.857
Should I increase
her IV nitro drip?

11:23.900 --> 11:26.381
- Uh, yes, let's do that.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.426
- Okay.
Will do, Dr. Goodwin.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.560
- I may be out of practice.
- Oh, you?

11:31.603 --> 11:33.257
No.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.564
- I bring platelets.
- Great, thank you.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.609
Today is gonna be
kind of a day.

11:37.653 --> 11:40.438
- I heard.
And Wilder, did she say yes?

11:40.482 --> 11:43.659
- Uh, she said no,
quite a few times, actually.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.965
But I did...
- Dr. Goodwin.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.488
- Sort of convince her to,
um, think about it.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.969
- We still have 19 patients
left on rounds.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.927
Platelets are for Bay Five.

11:50.971 --> 11:52.973
- Cop--
copy.

11:58.065 --> 12:01.851
So I hear you got into
a nasty fight with a mountain.

12:01.895 --> 12:04.767
- Must have fallen,
I don't know, 60 feet.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.769
- Oh, my God, how terrifying.

12:06.813 --> 12:09.424
- My partner and I,
we've been climbing together

12:09.467 --> 12:11.818
such a long time.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.689
Do you know, is he here?

12:13.733 --> 12:15.430
- Um, I haven't seen him.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.824
He may have been taken
to another hospital.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.914
- Could you find out?
His name's Garrett Turner.

12:20.957 --> 12:23.046
He got it way worse than me.
- Of course.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.787
- Uh, Helen,
two more just rolled in,

12:24.831 --> 12:26.484
and I got an acute leukemic
in Bay Six.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.051
Can you take a look?
- Max, why didn't you pull in

12:28.095 --> 12:29.749
some help
from another department?

12:29.792 --> 12:31.315
- Uh, which one?
They're all understaffed.

12:31.359 --> 12:32.577
If I can keep us afloat
long enough

12:32.621 --> 12:33.796
for Perez and Agata
to recover--

12:33.840 --> 12:35.972
- Max,
that was me saying I'm in.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.800
I'm staying.

12:37.844 --> 12:40.803
- I would kiss you, but...

12:42.674 --> 12:44.938
- I need to talk to someone.
- Oh, I know.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.549
Me too.
It's amazing, isn't it?

12:47.592 --> 12:49.638
- What is?
- Max and Helen.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.031
I mean, finally.

12:51.074 --> 12:53.773
All that sexual tension
just brewing for years.

12:53.816 --> 12:56.384
- Wait,
weren't they already a thing?

12:56.427 --> 12:58.038
- Are you kidding?
No.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.909
But Casey said
they definitely are now, so.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.650
- Okay, great.
Well, they're two adults.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.826
Nothing's standing
in their way.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.697
It's no big deal.

13:05.741 --> 13:08.135
- How do you enjoy
any movie ever?

13:08.178 --> 13:14.141
- Okay, look, the, uh,
woman I'm seeing,

13:14.184 --> 13:15.969
I said I was excited
to see her,

13:16.012 --> 13:18.449
and all of a sudden
she just froze me out.

13:18.493 --> 13:19.929
Like,
I don't even know what I said.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.104
- Mm, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

13:21.148 --> 13:22.802
I'm gonna save you some time.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.848
The thing about women is they
just want to hear two words.

13:25.892 --> 13:28.024
"I'm sorry."
That's it.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.505
It's a silver bullet
to any argument.

13:30.548 --> 13:32.594
I actually could have
saved myself three hours

13:32.637 --> 13:35.858
of processing last night
if I followed my own advice.

13:35.902 --> 13:38.469
- Dr. Bloom,
Casey needs you.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.732
- O2 sat's dropping.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.691
- CT scan?
- Negative.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.736
Isn't a stroke,
and he's crashing fast.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.086
- Okay,
we're back to square one.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.610
I need more information.
Give me some history.

13:48.653 --> 13:49.959
Nothing happened out there
on the boat?

13:50.003 --> 13:52.396
- No, nothing.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.529
- Well, how's he been feeling?
Has he been sick recently?

13:54.572 --> 13:56.139
- He's had some back pain,
but that's all of us.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.880
We work in construction.
- Yeah, if you're collecting

13:57.924 --> 13:59.403
a paycheck, you're in pain.

13:59.447 --> 14:00.796
- What else? Think!

14:00.840 --> 14:02.406
- I mean, he had the flu
or something last month.

14:02.450 --> 14:03.625
Is that what you mean?
- Yeah, yeah, he even

14:03.668 --> 14:05.496
called out sick,
stayed home a couple days.

14:05.540 --> 14:06.541
- Yeah,
and that's not like Joe.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.717
- Post-viral myocarditis?
- Worse.

14:08.760 --> 14:09.936
Given the arm numbness,

14:09.979 --> 14:12.764
post-viral
Guillain-Barré syndrome.

14:12.808 --> 14:15.115
His whole nervous system
is shutting down.

14:15.158 --> 14:17.160
- Carla has V-fib.
- Pulseless VT.

14:17.204 --> 14:18.596
- Epi.

14:20.076 --> 14:22.470
Let's start chest compressions.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.173
- Come on, Carla.

14:31.479 --> 14:32.959
- I need help over here!

14:38.486 --> 14:40.575
Hello?

14:40.618 --> 14:42.446
- We're losing him!

14:42.490 --> 14:43.665
- Anyone?

14:46.886 --> 14:47.060
.

14:53.718 --> 14:55.416
- Clear.

14:55.459 --> 14:56.852
- Clear.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.031
I got a pulse.

15:02.075 --> 15:03.772
- No pulse.
Going again.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.513
Clear.

15:06.514 --> 15:07.994
- He's back.

15:08.690 --> 15:11.084
- She's back.
- Carla, are you with me?

15:13.695 --> 15:15.653
- I think so.
- Good.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.396
- What the hell, Max?

15:19.962 --> 15:22.356
- We're getting through it.
- This isn't short-staffed.

15:22.399 --> 15:23.879
This is not staffed.
- I know.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.446
What do you want me to do?
I'm not gonna close our doors.

15:25.489 --> 15:26.621
- You need
to ask for more help.

15:26.664 --> 15:27.970
- Who? Whose help
am I supposed to ask--

15:28.014 --> 15:29.537
- My help.

15:29.580 --> 15:30.973
You should have asked
for my help.

15:32.757 --> 15:36.457
- Well, I wanted to,
but what about your residents?

15:36.500 --> 15:39.721
- They're fine.
They got Walsh and an iPad.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.549
I'm staying here with you.

15:44.682 --> 15:47.990
- Sleep with the boss,
ride to work in a limo.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.513
Girl, give me that gig.

15:49.557 --> 15:50.993
- Yeah, how late you think
she got to sleep in?

15:51.037 --> 15:53.561
- Must be nice
is all I'm saying.

15:55.911 --> 15:58.696
- It's more of a town car
than a limo.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.047
- Hey, it isn't personal.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.962
- Then what is it?

16:03.005 --> 16:05.486
- Just be aware
of your privilege, okay?

16:06.139 --> 16:09.533
- Privilege?
I'm not privileged.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.709
Six months ago
I was living in my car.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.885
- Well,
you've come a long way, baby.

16:13.929 --> 16:16.062
- That iPad with all the
emergency medicine textbooks

16:16.105 --> 16:17.541
downloaded on it,

16:17.585 --> 16:19.195
we share one of those
between the three of us,

16:19.239 --> 16:21.023
so we have to study in shifts.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.852
- Yeah, and we share a cruddy
studio in Morris Heights,

16:23.895 --> 16:25.071
three buses away.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.637
You know,
we have to wake up at00 a.m.

16:26.681 --> 16:27.812
just to get here on time.

16:27.856 --> 16:30.641
- - That the Littmann 3
- M?

16:30.685 --> 16:32.469
I can barely hear a jackhammer
with this thing,

16:32.513 --> 16:33.993
let alone a heart murmur.

16:34.906 --> 16:37.039
But it's all I got.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.521
So just know,
from where we're standing...

16:40.564 --> 16:42.827
You're looking
pretty privileged to us.

16:53.099 --> 16:56.102
- I want to get it even more.

16:56.145 --> 16:59.061
Tell me what it's about.

16:59.105 --> 17:02.499
Own your feelings.

17:03.718 --> 17:09.115
There's a pressure
inside of me, and, uh...

17:10.986 --> 17:13.554
When I see something
that I can take,

17:13.597 --> 17:15.077
it just builds and builds.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.862
- Man, that sounds really hard.
- Pause.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.908
Why did you interrupt me?

17:19.951 --> 17:22.911
- I was being empathetic.
That's what you told me to do.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.479
- Your impulse is correct;
the timing is bad.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.089
I'm in the room with you.
I can read these decisions.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.265
Okay?

17:29.309 --> 17:31.224
All right, so why don't
we explore that pressure

17:31.267 --> 17:32.573
that Kevin mentioned?

17:32.616 --> 17:34.488
How does that make him feel?

17:35.924 --> 17:37.578
You don't know,
because you cut him off

17:37.621 --> 17:40.102
before he could
finish telling you.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.799
If you had let him finish,
he would have told you

17:41.843 --> 17:44.715
that it makes him feel
like he wants to hurt himself.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.717
If you cut him off, if you--

17:46.761 --> 17:49.111
if you slam
that window of honesty,

17:49.155 --> 17:52.506
that could be it,
that could be his life.

17:52.549 --> 17:54.638
Got it?

17:54.682 --> 17:56.510
Okay.
Good.

17:56.553 --> 18:00.862
If a patient is trying
to share with you,

18:00.905 --> 18:02.646
listen.

18:02.690 --> 18:03.952
Okay?
- Yeah.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.954
- Good.
Drop back in.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.303
Here we go.

18:10.350 --> 18:13.570
So there's a pressure,
builds and builds inside of me,

18:13.614 --> 18:17.008
and if--
I feel like if I don't take it,

18:17.052 --> 18:20.708
something awful
is going to happen.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.666
- You know,
it sounds like this is rooted

18:22.710 --> 18:24.146
in conflict with your father.

18:24.190 --> 18:28.629
- No; way, way, way too soon
to drop the dad bomb.

18:28.672 --> 18:31.153
That came out of left field.
That's--

18:31.197 --> 18:34.765
you can't--you can't have
a patient's epiphany for them.

18:34.809 --> 18:38.769
Your job is to gently
guide them to it.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.902
You got it?

18:40.945 --> 18:42.599
- No, I don't got it.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.688
- Okay.

18:44.732 --> 18:47.213
- I have been working
with patients for months.

18:47.256 --> 18:49.867
I've helped people.

18:49.911 --> 18:53.306
And real patients let me talk
for more than five seconds.

18:53.349 --> 18:55.177
- Okay.
I can see that I've upset you.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.658
I know this is hard.
All right?

18:57.701 --> 19:00.008
But believe me when I tell you
it is so much better

19:00.051 --> 19:03.054
to be stopped before
you make the huge mistake.

19:03.098 --> 19:04.969
All right?
That goes for everyone.

19:05.013 --> 19:06.667
That's all of you.
Not just you.

19:06.710 --> 19:09.322
And based on what I've seen
in here today, from now on,

19:09.365 --> 19:11.846
I'm gonna be sitting in on
all of your actual sessions.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.630
And if you're going down
a dangerous path,

19:13.674 --> 19:15.197
I will jump in.
I'll be there. All right?

19:15.241 --> 19:17.112
Now, I know that seems
like a lot, because,

19:17.156 --> 19:18.287
quite frankly, it is.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.898
And I promise you guys,
one of these days,

19:20.942 --> 19:22.117
you will thank me for it.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.206
Okay?
Why don't you take a break.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.600
Next resident, please.

19:27.818 --> 19:29.951
Come on, next resident.
Don't be scared.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.693
Come on in.

19:38.786 --> 19:42.093
Uh,
where are all my residents?

19:42.137 --> 19:44.183
- They walked out.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.625
- Hey.

19:53.888 --> 19:56.804
Look, I know you're mad,

19:56.847 --> 19:59.981
but I just want to say
I'm sorry.

20:00.024 --> 20:02.331
I really--
I really am.

20:02.375 --> 20:05.769
- You're sorry?
- Yeah.

20:05.813 --> 20:09.033
- For what, exactly?

20:10.687 --> 20:15.170
- I am sorry for earlier.

20:16.432 --> 20:18.347
- Earlier?

20:21.002 --> 20:24.135
- Like, when I said
that you couldn't get enough,

20:24.179 --> 20:27.704
I wasn't implying that
you were, like, a nymphomaniac,

20:27.748 --> 20:30.925
or that your husband
couldn't get the job done.

20:30.968 --> 20:35.190
- This has nothing to do
with my husband or sex.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.367
You treated this
like I'm committing adultery.

20:38.411 --> 20:43.285
- Right, and I did not want
to make you feel that way.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.330
- Good.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.246
- Good.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.991
Although...

20:54.035 --> 20:57.473
it is adultery, isn't it?

20:57.517 --> 20:58.996
- That's what you think
this is?

20:59.040 --> 21:01.782
- I mean, well,
you are married

21:01.825 --> 21:03.479
and also sleeping with me.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.307
- Openly.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.831
- It doesn't change the fact
that I'm the other guy.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.007
- Of course it does.

21:13.315 --> 21:17.972
I'm not screwing you behind
my husband's back, Floyd.

21:18.015 --> 21:21.236
I'm in a relationship with you.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.721
At least I thought I was.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.344
- Hypertensive patient
going down fast.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.303
- Uh, yeah.

21:46.130 --> 21:49.786
Hey Carla, how you feeling?

21:49.830 --> 21:52.049
- "Flight of the Bumblebee"?
- That's right.

21:52.093 --> 21:55.314
Reminds me of you,
running around here nonstop.

21:55.357 --> 21:57.925
- Yeah, I hear that one's
a nightmare for orchestras.

21:57.968 --> 22:00.231
- Oh, yeah.
It's a beast.

22:00.275 --> 22:02.930
But I can play it in my sleep.

22:02.973 --> 22:04.758
- Bet you can.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.368
I'm gonna start you
on diltiazem drip

22:06.412 --> 22:08.239
to level out your AFib, okay?

22:08.283 --> 22:10.024
- Yeah,
it goes all over the scale

22:10.067 --> 22:12.896
and never lands anywhere.

22:12.940 --> 22:17.161
All that Sturm und Drang
for nothing.

22:17.205 --> 22:18.554
- Hypotensive patient,
Bay Four.

22:18.598 --> 22:20.382
Triple A about to blow.
- Carla, I promise you,

22:20.426 --> 22:22.384
this is not for nothing.

22:25.561 --> 22:27.998
- Ah!

22:29.913 --> 22:32.351
- Already on it.
- Ah, my leg.

22:33.961 --> 22:35.266
- Okay, swelling
and bleeding are up.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.572
- Oh, it hurts, doc.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.313
- The platelets we gave you
to clot your blood

22:38.357 --> 22:40.271
have made things worse;
we need to reverse course

22:40.315 --> 22:41.925
and give you
blood thinners instead.

22:41.969 --> 22:43.100
- I'm bleeding and you want
to give me something

22:43.144 --> 22:44.363
that's gonna
make me bleed more?

22:44.406 --> 22:45.538
- It sounds backwards,
but it works.

22:45.581 --> 22:47.017
- And if it doesn't?

22:47.061 --> 22:49.455
- Dr. Sharpe, your
leukemic patient's febrile.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.544
- Be right there.
I'll be right back.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.154
Victoria?

22:55.330 --> 22:56.636
- Have you seen any nurses?

22:56.679 --> 22:57.941
I'm looking for my Triple A--
- Yep, Bay Four.

22:57.985 --> 22:59.508
- Transfer from the seventh
floor, GI bleed.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.162
Tachy and hypotensive.
- Uh, I'll take it.

23:01.205 --> 23:02.468
Hey, how's life?
Triple A in Bay Four.

23:02.511 --> 23:03.947
Let's go to Six.
- On my way.

23:03.991 --> 23:05.427
- Transfer from the ED.
Pneumonia on BiPAP.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.255
Heading for a tube fast.

23:07.298 --> 23:08.909
- I've got this one.
- What are you doing?

23:08.952 --> 23:10.214
- Triple A in Bay Four!

23:10.258 --> 23:12.042
Gonna need an intubation kit
and a vent, stat!

23:14.262 --> 23:16.307
- You gonna take the new admit?
- I'm surgery.

23:16.351 --> 23:17.961
Who's got the new admit?

23:20.486 --> 23:22.313
- He's got V-tach.
All right.

23:22.357 --> 23:24.533
Young man, can you speak to me?
- Yes, yes.

23:24.577 --> 23:26.361
- Is ICU down?

23:27.623 --> 23:29.930
- Okay, I've got this.
Just take the Triple A

23:29.973 --> 23:32.367
in Bay Four,
and tell Flores she's up.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.456
- Since when
do you work the ICU?

23:34.500 --> 23:36.371
- Since there's no one else.

23:38.504 --> 23:38.721
.

23:38.765 --> 23:41.245
- I don't get it, Gladys.

23:41.289 --> 23:43.291
I just don't get it.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.163
That's not true.
I do, I get it.

23:46.207 --> 23:47.730
I get...

23:47.774 --> 23:49.993
nobody likes having their
mistakes pointed out, you know.

23:50.037 --> 23:51.691
But to just get up and leave?

23:51.734 --> 23:53.257
They just left!
They fell short!

23:53.301 --> 23:54.650
I mean, I'm doing my job.

23:54.694 --> 23:57.479
It is literally my job
to correct them.

23:57.523 --> 24:00.047
- Oh, bullpucky!

24:00.090 --> 24:04.312
- That's a little...harsh
and old-fashioned.

24:04.355 --> 24:06.575
- Your job isn't
correcting them.

24:06.619 --> 24:10.057
It's to help them
become better doctors.

24:10.100 --> 24:13.582
And since every last one
of your residents left today

24:13.626 --> 24:15.410
wanting to throw out
their career

24:15.454 --> 24:19.153
or throw you out a window,
what's more likely?

24:19.196 --> 24:21.416
That you got a room
full of dunces

24:21.460 --> 24:26.290
or that the person
falling short today...

24:26.334 --> 24:27.509
is you?

24:33.515 --> 24:35.299
- Mm.

24:35.343 --> 24:37.998
All right.
I hear you.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.783
I guess that maybe
I am falling a little bit short

24:40.827 --> 24:43.264
of everyone's expectations.

24:43.307 --> 24:46.485
including my own.

24:46.528 --> 24:50.097
But that doesn't change the
fact that these are doctors.

24:50.140 --> 24:52.360
They're treating real people
with real issues,

24:52.403 --> 24:54.318
and I can't just
risk them failing.

24:54.362 --> 24:58.148
- But Iggy, they will fail.

25:00.455 --> 25:03.371
I mean, when you were
starting out, didn't you?

25:08.594 --> 25:10.509
- Dr. Sharpe.

25:10.552 --> 25:12.032
- What are you doing
out of bed?

25:12.075 --> 25:13.686
Your ruptured spleen
could blow any minute!

25:13.729 --> 25:15.731
- Did you hear anything about
Garrett, my climbing partner?

25:15.775 --> 25:17.516
- He's at Baptist.
I don't know anything else.

25:17.559 --> 25:19.256
I'm waiting for a call back
from his doctors.

25:19.300 --> 25:22.042
Now, come on.
Come on.

25:23.391 --> 25:25.436
- We were rappelling.
- Mm-hmm.

25:25.480 --> 25:30.703
- We were tied on to opposite
ends of the same rope.

25:30.746 --> 25:33.662
Going too fast, overconfident.

25:37.666 --> 25:40.539
I got snagged.

25:41.409 --> 25:43.585
I came off the line.

25:44.412 --> 25:47.502
Garrett fell.
I...

25:47.546 --> 25:50.723
I hit a ledge, but...

25:50.766 --> 25:53.813
he just kept going.

25:55.510 --> 25:59.340
He just fell such a long way.

25:59.383 --> 26:01.211
I just need to know.

26:01.255 --> 26:02.735
- I'll call them again.

26:04.258 --> 26:05.259
- Okay.

26:11.265 --> 26:12.875
- I won't be using these
anymore,

26:12.919 --> 26:15.312
and I will be taking the bus
to work from this point on.

26:15.356 --> 26:19.882
- Okay, so I guess you'll be
finishing your residency never?

26:19.926 --> 26:22.450
- You have given me access
to wonderful things,

26:22.493 --> 26:25.584
things I've never had before,
but I--

26:25.627 --> 26:27.760
and I like them, I do.
I really, really do.

26:27.803 --> 26:29.413
- I feel like
there's a "but" coming.

26:29.457 --> 26:31.154
- But I'm becoming
like a different person,

26:31.198 --> 26:33.592
a person with privilege.

26:35.724 --> 26:37.073
- Bay Eight, Bay Eight.

26:37.117 --> 26:39.554
How do you think
half the people here got ahead,

26:39.598 --> 26:41.338
myself included?

26:41.382 --> 26:43.427
Yes, I am a super sweet--
hey, wait, wait, wait.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.386
Take this, take this.

26:45.429 --> 26:47.214
Yes, I am a super sweet doctor

26:47.257 --> 26:48.868
with a super sweet
bedside manner,

26:48.911 --> 26:52.436
but easy access to textbooks,
top-notch equipment,

26:52.480 --> 26:55.396
a good night's sleep--
those things make you better.

26:55.439 --> 26:57.354
Not a single one of those
residents would give up

26:57.398 --> 27:01.228
those things if they had them,
so why should you?

27:01.271 --> 27:02.925
- I've always scraped by,

27:02.969 --> 27:06.146
done the best I could
with what little I had.

27:06.189 --> 27:08.931
Now all these fancy things...

27:08.975 --> 27:11.194
you...

27:11.238 --> 27:13.936
make me feel like that's
the reason I'm successful,

27:13.980 --> 27:15.546
like I didn't earn it.

27:15.590 --> 27:18.462
<i>
- ER physician to 3, stat.</i>

27:18.506 --> 27:21.291
<i>ER physician to 3, stat.
- It's Joe.</i>

27:24.468 --> 27:27.210
- Heart rate's slowing.

27:27.254 --> 27:28.690
- It's not GBS.
What am I missing?

27:28.734 --> 27:31.345
- Symptoms?
- Back pain, ocular ptosis,

27:31.388 --> 27:36.350
aphasia, respiratory failure,
arm weakness, now bradycardia.

27:36.393 --> 27:38.482
- Descending paralysis?

27:38.526 --> 27:40.397
- He was out on the boat
with his buddies.

27:40.441 --> 27:41.921
Bring me everything he had
out on the water.

27:41.964 --> 27:43.531
Hurry.

27:44.575 --> 27:45.881
- Why are you still here?

27:45.925 --> 27:47.535
- Because where the hell
is everyone else?

27:47.578 --> 27:49.319
- Also a very good question.
What you got?

27:49.363 --> 27:51.974
- Persistent V-tach.
- Carotid pulse is good.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.584
- Yeah, but I don't
have a radial pulse.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.195
- Let's check for bleeds.

27:55.238 --> 27:56.936
- Clavicle's out of alignment.

27:56.979 --> 27:58.851
- Oh, the seat belt must
have dislocated his clavicle,

27:58.894 --> 28:00.548
pushed it into his shoulder,
and now it's blocking

28:00.591 --> 28:03.638
the brachial artery, which
is irritating the left atrium.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.335
- Okay, yep.

28:05.379 --> 28:07.511
Okay, I'm gonna
sit you up here, Ferris, okay?

28:07.555 --> 28:08.991
I know, I know. All right.
You're gonna feel a tug.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.776
- Okay.

28:10.819 --> 28:12.212
both: One, two--

28:16.390 --> 28:18.958
- Let this go.
- Whoa.

28:19.001 --> 28:20.002
Thank you.
- All right.

28:20.046 --> 28:21.569
- You all right?

28:21.612 --> 28:23.527
- Clavicle's back in place.
- Pulse is good.

28:23.571 --> 28:26.661
- All right, cool.
Yeah, go, I got it from here.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.445
- Oh, yes.
Yes!

28:28.489 --> 28:30.796
This is amazing, because
you wouldn't be here in person

28:30.839 --> 28:32.449
if the answer was--

28:32.493 --> 28:33.929
- No.
- No.

28:33.973 --> 28:35.409
- Really?

28:36.627 --> 28:38.455
- I wanted
to tell you in person.

28:38.499 --> 28:40.457
The answer is still no.

28:40.501 --> 28:41.807
- No. Uh...

28:41.850 --> 28:42.851
Listen.

28:43.939 --> 28:45.680
Um...

28:47.638 --> 28:51.904
- My brother, Adam,
my younger brother,

28:51.947 --> 28:53.819
he's a paranoid schizophrenic.

28:53.862 --> 28:57.561
He's been in and out
of facilities most of his life.

28:57.605 --> 29:01.391
But since the pandemic,
he's been living with me.

29:03.089 --> 29:06.048
It's changed us for the better.

29:08.572 --> 29:11.271
He is my priority now,

29:11.314 --> 29:13.577
not my work.

29:13.621 --> 29:17.320
New Amsterdam deserves
a medical director

29:17.364 --> 29:19.758
who's gonna
put the hospital first.

29:24.066 --> 29:26.765
<i>- Nurse Foster,
please dial 819... </i>

29:30.377 --> 29:31.595
- Speaking of.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.991
- It's Carla, BP bottomed out.
- Up the Levophed.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.776
- Maxed out.
- Dobutamine?

29:37.819 --> 29:38.864
- All the pressers
are maxed out.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.648
We have no room to move.

29:40.691 --> 29:42.911
- Okay, then, um...

29:42.955 --> 29:44.695
then we do
an intra-aortic balloon pump.

29:44.739 --> 29:47.394
- That takes the entire
ICU staff in the best of times.

29:47.437 --> 29:50.049
Does this look like
the best of times?

29:59.798 --> 30:01.974
- We're doing
an intra-aortic balloon pump.

30:02.017 --> 30:03.714
- Max, you should
have closed the ICU

30:03.758 --> 30:05.107
and transferred Carla
hours ago.

30:05.151 --> 30:06.108
Now it's too late.

30:10.983 --> 30:11.157
.

30:15.726 --> 30:17.119
- You can't put
in a balloon pump alone.

30:17.163 --> 30:19.513
- Carla can't live
with a blood pressure of 60/40.

30:19.556 --> 30:20.644
She needs helping; I'm helping.

30:20.688 --> 30:21.863
I don't know
how to do anything else.

30:21.907 --> 30:22.995
- All right, well,
if we're gonna do this,

30:23.038 --> 30:25.475
she needs
to be maximally oxygenated.

30:25.519 --> 30:27.826
- Thank you.
- I need you.

30:30.219 --> 30:32.091
Intra-aortic balloon.
- Here?

30:32.134 --> 30:33.570
- Yes.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.659
- You'll need
ultrasound guidance.

30:37.313 --> 30:38.924
IABP.
- Right now?

30:38.967 --> 30:40.534
- Yep.

30:40.577 --> 30:41.840
- Where's the rest of the team?

30:41.883 --> 30:43.624
- What you see is what you get.

30:44.277 --> 30:46.061
- That isn't enough access.

30:47.541 --> 30:49.978
Ventricular assist.

30:52.024 --> 30:55.114
- Prepping an arterial cutdown.

31:04.210 --> 31:08.823
- Sliding in the trocar, and
now threading in the balloon.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.565
All right. Here we go.

31:14.655 --> 31:17.092
Advancing.
Steadily.

31:17.136 --> 31:18.964
Easy.
Gentle.

31:19.007 --> 31:21.096
A little further.
How's placement?

31:21.140 --> 31:23.794
- South
of the subclavian artery.

31:23.838 --> 31:26.145
- North of superior mesenteric.

31:26.188 --> 31:27.581
- Floyd?

31:28.582 --> 31:30.714
Come on.

31:35.154 --> 31:38.635
Come on.
Come on.

31:40.724 --> 31:42.944
- Ah, come on,
you can do better.

31:46.208 --> 31:47.862
- Now we're talking.

32:02.746 --> 32:06.098
- What are you all doing here?

32:06.141 --> 32:08.187
- Don't worry, gonna have
you playing your flute again

32:08.230 --> 32:09.579
in no time.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.016
But...

32:11.059 --> 32:12.931
not "Flight of the Bumblebee."

32:24.246 --> 32:26.727
- How long have you
felt like this?

32:26.770 --> 32:29.686
- Always.

32:31.123 --> 32:36.693
My sister thinks I'm the one
that has it together.

32:36.737 --> 32:40.001
My sister is so brave.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.351
She's so free.

32:42.395 --> 32:44.963
I envy her,

32:45.006 --> 32:49.010
and I hate what
that does to us.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.752
What should I do?

33:01.109 --> 33:03.285
- Well...

33:04.983 --> 33:08.203
What if you're the one
who has it together?

33:08.247 --> 33:11.424
- Joe, how often
do you change the leaves?

33:11.467 --> 33:13.774
- What? It's got to steep.
I let it sit there a few days.

33:13.817 --> 33:15.036
- That's how you got botulism.
- Botulism?

33:15.080 --> 33:16.646
- What?
- Yep.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.953
The bacteria was growing
in your thermos

33:18.997 --> 33:20.781
in these chamomile leaves.

33:20.824 --> 33:22.783
- Oh!
Wait, wait, wait, wait,

33:22.826 --> 33:24.437
Joe almost died
from chamomile tea?

33:24.480 --> 33:27.048
- That's a pretty
rough obituary, man.

33:27.092 --> 33:29.050
- I mean, chamomile?

33:29.094 --> 33:31.052
- Yeah, they got it on tap
at my yoga place.

33:31.096 --> 33:34.664
- Yoga?
Joe.

33:34.708 --> 33:37.276
Who hurt you?

33:37.319 --> 33:39.060
- It's called self-care, Terry.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.453
Doc, tell him.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.281
- Yoga is great.
He's right.

33:42.324 --> 33:44.805
You should all give it a try.
- Yeah.

33:44.848 --> 33:47.025
Can any of you big lugs
bend down and touch your toes?

33:48.809 --> 33:51.681
I didn't think so.

33:56.817 --> 33:59.341
- I wrote my resignation letter
over the weekend.

34:01.343 --> 34:05.695
This past year's just...
just been too much.

34:07.262 --> 34:10.048
Too much grief,
too much suffering.

34:10.091 --> 34:12.833
I never felt like
I could do enough up here.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.316
Today was supposed
to be my last day.

34:18.882 --> 34:19.883
- I get it.

34:21.798 --> 34:24.149
I'm just sorry
it was like this.

34:24.192 --> 34:26.325
- I'm not.

34:26.368 --> 34:31.243
You, the other docs,
your friends, man,

34:31.286 --> 34:33.201
pitching in,
holding things together--

34:33.245 --> 34:35.812
I mean...

34:35.856 --> 34:38.163
for the first time
in a long time,

34:38.206 --> 34:40.904
I felt like
we weren't alone here.

34:41.470 --> 34:46.127
- So...you're thinking maybe...

34:46.171 --> 34:48.042
maybe...

34:48.086 --> 34:50.523
- Eh, I'll stick around.

34:50.566 --> 34:52.133
- Thank God.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.787
I can't fill
another empty spot

34:53.830 --> 34:56.920
because my list is too long
and you're too good.

35:29.257 --> 35:32.217
- So I've been thinking
about what you said earlier.

35:32.260 --> 35:33.827
- You have?
- Yep.

35:33.870 --> 35:35.394
Not a chance.

35:35.437 --> 35:37.874
I am not gonna let you give up
all the important things

35:37.918 --> 35:40.355
that you need to get ahead.

35:40.399 --> 35:42.401
- But--
- Because...

35:42.444 --> 35:45.012
I'm gonna give them
to all the residents.

35:45.055 --> 35:48.929
New iPads, new equipment,
all of it.

35:48.972 --> 35:51.410
Everyone deserves
a level playing field.

35:51.453 --> 35:55.109
- You're gonna pay for that?
For everyone?

35:55.153 --> 35:58.330
- No.
You are.

35:58.373 --> 36:01.420
Because you are gonna
start paying rent.

36:01.463 --> 36:05.119
So you don't think for a second
that you don't deserve

36:05.163 --> 36:07.382
all the wonderful things
that you have.

36:11.256 --> 36:12.953
- Not for a second.

36:27.620 --> 36:29.274
- Iggy just described
this year's harvest

36:29.317 --> 36:31.276
to Brantley as "buxom."

36:43.288 --> 36:46.508
<i>- I'm sorry, Lyn.</i>

36:48.597 --> 36:54.429
And this time, I know
what I'm apologizing for.

36:57.127 --> 36:59.913
I made this about sex...

37:01.393 --> 37:06.354
Because I thought that's
all I was allowed to have.

37:08.313 --> 37:12.491
But it's killing me
because I do want more.

37:15.450 --> 37:18.540
I want something real.
I...

37:21.935 --> 37:24.111
I want to hear stories
about people I don't know

37:24.154 --> 37:25.504
and will never meet.

37:25.547 --> 37:29.290
I want to walk out
of terrible plays with you

37:29.334 --> 37:34.382
and laugh...for years.

37:38.299 --> 37:41.215
I want all of you.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.044
And if I can't have that,
then...

37:44.087 --> 37:45.915
- We can have all that.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.483
- Yeah?

37:56.186 --> 37:58.319
- Just...

38:01.104 --> 38:02.671
- Not here.

38:06.284 --> 38:10.505
- Then let's take a walk.
See where we end up.

38:25.390 --> 38:26.434
- Wrong roof.

38:29.132 --> 38:30.612
Guess you already knew that.

38:39.708 --> 38:43.712
My patient's climbing partner,

38:43.756 --> 38:46.236
Garrett Turner...

38:47.325 --> 38:48.978
He didn't make it.

38:55.550 --> 39:00.729
- They were out on this massive
rock face together,

39:00.773 --> 39:04.603
tethered...

39:04.646 --> 39:06.605
but they...

39:06.648 --> 39:09.042
they just got out of balance
with each other.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.743
Look, I know that I didn't
ask you to come to London.

39:14.787 --> 39:17.659
That was your choice,
and I am really excited

39:17.703 --> 39:20.009
that you're making
this move with me.

39:23.230 --> 39:27.277
But it's like
we're tethered together

39:27.321 --> 39:29.062
and we're climbing
the same mountain

39:29.105 --> 39:31.412
and we're on the same rope.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.501
And I...

39:36.852 --> 39:40.290
I actually don't know
if I trust you...

39:42.467 --> 39:45.818
Like, to--to be my partner.

39:48.864 --> 39:53.434
You're not preparing to leave.
You're not even telling anyone.

39:53.478 --> 39:57.656
And because we are
in this together, I, um...

39:59.788 --> 40:03.662
I fear that you...

40:03.705 --> 40:07.492
you're gonna take me down
with you.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.327
- We should go.

40:19.155 --> 40:21.244
They're waiting.

40:33.474 --> 40:35.694
- Well, well, well,

40:35.737 --> 40:39.698
look who decided
to show up <i>together,</i> huh?

40:39.741 --> 40:41.526
- So apparently today
is the day

40:41.569 --> 40:43.223
when I get everything wrong.

40:43.266 --> 40:44.659
- Y'all do make a cute couple.

40:44.703 --> 40:46.705
- Yeah, but what's your,
like, couple name?

40:46.748 --> 40:49.577
Uh, Helmax?
Goodsharpe?

40:51.492 --> 40:53.842
- I can't believe
I actually care about this.

40:55.627 --> 40:57.367
- This is amazing.

40:57.411 --> 40:59.587
We have a little announcement
to make.

40:59.631 --> 41:02.764
- Speech, speech, speech!

41:03.896 --> 41:05.680
- Just say it already!

41:05.724 --> 41:09.118
- You guys aren't
making this any easier.

41:12.644 --> 41:15.385
Dr. Sharpe...

41:15.429 --> 41:18.519
Dr. Sharpe and I are leaving.

41:23.655 --> 41:26.919
We're leaving New Amsterdam
and we're moving to London.

41:59.691 --> 42:03.303
Karen.
It's so nice to hear from you.

42:03.346 --> 42:04.609
I'm a little busy
at the moment.

42:04.652 --> 42:07.437
Can I call you back?

42:09.657 --> 42:12.355
New Amsterdam?

42:18.536 --> 42:22.191
Well,
I'll have to think about it.
