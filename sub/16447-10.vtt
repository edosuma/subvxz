WEBVTT

00:02.974 --> 00:05.041
If we're going to be staying
in this apartment,

00:05.043 --> 00:06.476
would you be interested
in doing a little

00:06.478 --> 00:07.877
redecorating?

00:08.713 --> 00:11.848
Oh, actually, I would.

00:11.850 --> 00:13.716
Great, what'd you have in mind?

00:13.718 --> 00:16.853
Let's take every single thing
from the other apartment

00:16.855 --> 00:18.955
and put it in here.

00:18.957 --> 00:21.457
Well, how about we start
a little smaller?

00:21.459 --> 00:23.893
Like moving
the furniture around.

00:23.895 --> 00:26.129
You know, I have always thought

00:26.131 --> 00:28.064
that this couch
would look fantastic

00:28.066 --> 00:30.700
on the curb
in front of the building.

00:30.702 --> 00:34.203
Look, we can't just
throw away Penny's stuff,

00:34.205 --> 00:37.773
but we can ask
if she wants any of it back.

00:38.610 --> 00:40.643
You know, I wonder how
she feels about

00:40.645 --> 00:42.912
all this artwork.

00:42.914 --> 00:45.548
Well, I'm sure
she misses this one.

00:45.550 --> 00:48.918
I mean, it's the greatest gift
I've ever given anybody.

00:54.526 --> 00:59.328
It truly does capture the beauty
of your friendship with Penny.

01:01.266 --> 01:02.999
It may have appreciated
in value.

01:03.001 --> 01:06.169
The artist killed himself
shortly after painting that.

01:07.205 --> 01:10.873
Yeah, it seems only right
that she have it back.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.475
I can't wait to see
the look on her face

01:12.477 --> 01:15.077
when I give it to her again.

01:20.351 --> 01:23.920
Look, it's the same smile
she has in the painting.

01:53.887 --> 01:56.888
Yeah... there's hooks in the
closet, I can hang it right now.

01:56.890 --> 01:58.723
Oh, no, no,
Th-those hooks are gone.

01:58.725 --> 01:59.958
What happened to them?

01:59.960 --> 02:01.993
Uh, we ran out of candy
on Halloween,

02:01.995 --> 02:04.696
I was just giving
everything away.

02:05.532 --> 02:07.199
Hey, guys, what are you...?

02:07.201 --> 02:09.434
Oh, that's here, cool.

02:09.436 --> 02:12.204
Amy wants me to have it.

02:12.206 --> 02:13.872
Well, it would be selfish
of me to keep it.

02:13.874 --> 02:15.707
B-But it's a picture of you.

02:15.709 --> 02:17.509
And you.

02:17.511 --> 02:19.611
But you commissioned it.

02:19.613 --> 02:21.780
To give to you.

02:21.782 --> 02:24.049
But you like it so much.

02:24.051 --> 02:26.017
So do you.

02:27.054 --> 02:28.720
I seem to be losing.

02:28.722 --> 02:31.356
Yes, you do.

02:31.358 --> 02:33.125
You know, Leonard,
the more I think about it,

02:33.127 --> 02:35.794
there are a number of mutually
owned items in this apartment

02:35.796 --> 02:37.262
that you and I
should go through.

02:37.264 --> 02:38.563
Uh, for example...

02:39.566 --> 02:41.900
who gets our beloved sword,
Longclaw?

02:41.902 --> 02:42.901
Why don't you keep it?

02:42.903 --> 02:44.169
That seems fair;
we did just give you

02:44.171 --> 02:46.037
the painting.

02:46.039 --> 02:47.405
Yeah, I don't need
anything around

02:47.407 --> 02:49.574
that I can stab myself with.

02:49.576 --> 02:51.009
Wonderful,

02:51.011 --> 02:52.244
Longclaw is mine.

02:52.246 --> 02:54.212
And how about you keep

02:54.214 --> 02:56.414
our... avocado plant?

03:00.387 --> 03:02.988
Sounds right...
a limited edition collectible

03:02.990 --> 03:04.356
worth hundreds of dollars

03:04.358 --> 03:05.590
and a thing

03:05.592 --> 03:08.627
that grew out of a thing
we fished from the trash.

03:08.629 --> 03:11.530
Although, Amy and I did
just move in together,

03:11.532 --> 03:14.166
and a plant is
a lovely housewarming gift.

03:14.168 --> 03:16.268
Fine, take the plant.

03:16.270 --> 03:17.769
Oh, we got a sword
and a plant;

03:17.771 --> 03:19.337
our apartment's
really shaping up.

03:22.843 --> 03:24.643
Stuart, you didn't have
to get us a baby gift.

03:24.645 --> 03:25.911
Oh.

03:25.913 --> 03:28.446
Just homemade coupons for things
you might need help with

03:28.448 --> 03:29.848
before the baby gets here.

03:29.850 --> 03:32.951
Going to the grocery store,
driving you to the doctor.

03:32.953 --> 03:36.254
If you're not in a hurry,
I can dig you a koi pond.

03:38.225 --> 03:40.125
A foot massage?

03:40.127 --> 03:43.461
And that's not me being creepy,
that's for either of you.

03:45.632 --> 03:48.767
This is very nice,
Stuart, thank you.

03:48.769 --> 03:51.903
How come this one's on
the back of an eviction notice?

03:51.905 --> 03:55.507
Oh, yeah.
Uh, now that you mention it...

03:55.509 --> 03:57.842
can I live here?

03:59.213 --> 04:01.680
Stuart, we'd love
to help you out,

04:01.682 --> 04:04.716
but this a bad time;
we're about to have a baby.

04:04.718 --> 04:06.451
Or is that why
this is a great time?

04:06.453 --> 04:08.453
Think about it...
when that baby comes,

04:08.455 --> 04:10.689
you're gonna need all the help
you can get.

04:10.691 --> 04:12.123
Thank you,

04:12.125 --> 04:14.092
but I'm not really sure.

04:15.028 --> 04:16.560
Hang on, maybe it's
not the worst idea.

04:16.563 --> 04:19.497
I mean, he did do a good job
taking care of my mother.

04:19.499 --> 04:23.768
That woman didn't get heat rash
once with me on powder patrol.

04:25.505 --> 04:26.838
Hey...

04:26.840 --> 04:28.406
I guess you could stay
for a few days

04:28.408 --> 04:29.708
and we'll see how it goes.

04:29.710 --> 04:31.109
Thank you.

04:31.111 --> 04:32.911
And it's only temporary,

04:32.913 --> 04:35.080
just till I get back on my feet.

04:35.082 --> 04:37.882
or the baby goes off to college,
whichever happens first.

04:39.620 --> 04:41.453
When would you move in?

04:41.455 --> 04:44.222
Well, uh, my car broke down
in your driveway,

04:44.224 --> 04:46.625
so I'm gonna say now.

04:47.728 --> 04:49.628
But I am ready to be helpful.

04:49.630 --> 04:51.496
In fact...

04:51.498 --> 04:52.464
I'm gonna go vacuum.

04:52.466 --> 04:56.101
Hmm. Actually I just
did that this morning.

04:56.103 --> 04:57.502
Okay.

04:57.504 --> 04:58.770
Then I'll dust.

04:58.772 --> 05:00.972
I did that, too.

05:00.974 --> 05:04.276
Then I'll check the batteries
in the smoke detectors.

05:04.278 --> 05:06.111
Howard just did that.

05:06.113 --> 05:09.180
Yeah, let him do it.

05:12.786 --> 05:14.386
Oh.

05:14.388 --> 05:15.754
Remember when we got this

05:15.756 --> 05:17.188
at Comic-Con?

05:17.190 --> 05:18.490
Oh, yeah.

05:18.492 --> 05:21.493
The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.

05:21.495 --> 05:25.063
Live long and prosper.
Live long and prosper.

05:25.065 --> 05:26.831
Live long
and prosper.

05:26.833 --> 05:28.833
Live long and prosper.

05:28.835 --> 05:31.169
It's one of a kind.

05:31.171 --> 05:34.272
So if it breaks
there'd be none of it?

05:35.475 --> 05:36.608
Well, Leonard,

05:36.610 --> 05:38.443
you know, who should keep this?

05:38.445 --> 05:42.347
On the one hand, I love
Mr. Spock more than you do.

05:42.349 --> 05:45.617
On the other hand, I care more
about clocks than you do.

05:45.619 --> 05:47.152
So you think you should keep it?

05:47.154 --> 05:48.420
I'll be right across the hall.

05:48.422 --> 05:50.588
You'll probably be able
to hear it.

05:52.793 --> 05:54.059
Keep the clock, Sheldon.

05:54.061 --> 05:55.193
Thank you.

05:55.195 --> 05:57.796
Thank you.
Thank you?

05:58.665 --> 06:00.398
Oh, now...

06:00.400 --> 06:02.334
what about

06:02.336 --> 06:03.802
our 3-D chess set?

06:03.804 --> 06:04.869
Let me guess, you want it.

06:04.871 --> 06:06.171
Well, no,

06:06.173 --> 06:07.839
I just didn't think you'd want
a physical reminder

06:07.841 --> 06:10.575
of a game you never
managed to win.

06:10.577 --> 06:13.011
As a kindness, I should probably
take all the games.

06:13.013 --> 06:15.413
You know what, Sheldon, take it.

06:15.415 --> 06:16.981
In fact, you can
have everything.

06:16.983 --> 06:18.416
I really don't care.

06:18.652 --> 06:20.419
Are you sure?

06:20.421 --> 06:23.255
These items represent
our shared times together.

06:23.257 --> 06:24.756
Well, now they're yours.
Leonard....

06:24.758 --> 06:26.091
Well, you know
what's gonna happen.

06:26.093 --> 06:27.359
He's just gonna come up
with some reason

06:27.361 --> 06:28.827
why everything should be his.

06:28.829 --> 06:30.696
For a man so good
at predicting my moves,

06:30.698 --> 06:32.731
how come you stink at 3-D chess?

06:33.834 --> 06:36.468
Sheldon, you're-you're being
a little selfish.

06:36.470 --> 06:38.737
Why don't you let Leonard
keep a few things?

06:38.739 --> 06:40.038
It's not my fault
I'm bad at sharing;

06:40.040 --> 06:41.840
I skipped kindergarten.

06:41.842 --> 06:43.442
You know what?

06:43.444 --> 06:46.011
There is one thing I would like.

06:46.013 --> 06:48.380
Yeah, take whatever you want.

06:48.382 --> 06:50.549
I would like to keep...

06:50.551 --> 06:53.318
the official flag
of our apartment.

06:54.188 --> 06:56.521
But you don't even like flags.

06:56.523 --> 06:58.323
Yeah, I like this one.

07:00.361 --> 07:02.661
But I designed it.

07:02.663 --> 07:05.764
But you made me order it because
you were "too well-known"

07:05.766 --> 07:09.868
in the flag community
and they'd jack up the price.

07:09.870 --> 07:11.203
But you don't even understand

07:11.205 --> 07:13.538
its symbolism.
Oh, I do.

07:13.540 --> 07:16.908
The-the field of blue
represents you being miserable,

07:16.910 --> 07:19.578
and the lion sticking
its tongue out means

07:19.580 --> 07:21.446
I'm happy about it.

07:24.551 --> 07:26.985
Come along, Amy.

07:26.987 --> 07:29.254
I know when I'm not wanted.

07:30.157 --> 07:34.259
I don't think you do,
but all right.

07:36.563 --> 07:39.197
Stuart, you cooked?

07:39.199 --> 07:40.832
How did you know it wasn't me?

07:40.834 --> 07:42.534
There's only three
people in this house,

07:42.536 --> 07:44.670
and you'd still be
my fifth guess.

07:46.674 --> 07:49.074
That's Raj.

07:49.076 --> 07:50.242
You guys relax,

07:50.244 --> 07:51.343
I'll get it.

07:51.345 --> 07:54.046
Have some bread
while it's still warm.

07:55.449 --> 07:56.815
It's like we have a butler.

07:56.817 --> 07:59.851
If I had a Batsuit
I'd be Bruce Wayne.

08:00.688 --> 08:03.855
You have a Batsuit.

08:03.857 --> 08:06.324
It's pajamas, there's no cape.

08:07.628 --> 08:09.261
Hey, Raj.

08:09.263 --> 08:10.495
Hey, Stuart.

08:10.497 --> 08:12.998
What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm living here again.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.334
Do, uh, Howard
and Bernadette know?

08:16.336 --> 08:19.705
Or is it like a possum
in the walls kind of thing?

08:19.707 --> 08:23.508
No, I needed a place to stay

08:23.510 --> 08:24.676
and, with the baby coming,

08:24.678 --> 08:26.378
I figured they could
use some extra help.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.914
Okay, cool.

08:28.916 --> 08:30.248
Anyway, come on in,
dinner's ready.

08:30.250 --> 08:31.983
Oh, but I bought
Chinese takeout.

08:31.985 --> 08:34.186
Oh, okay.

08:34.188 --> 08:37.121
Well, if Bernadette wants her
ankles to swell up even more,

08:37.124 --> 08:38.323
she can have that.

08:42.462 --> 08:45.330
Is the Wi-Fi working for you?

08:45.332 --> 08:47.699
Uh, hang on.

08:47.701 --> 08:49.568
I don't think so,
I'm clicking on

08:49.570 --> 08:50.869
"One weird trick
for a flat belly,"

08:50.871 --> 08:51.870
but I'm still seeing

08:51.872 --> 08:55.173
"Celebrities who look like
their pets."

08:55.175 --> 08:57.275
Oh, I knew it,

08:57.277 --> 08:58.910
Sheldon changed the password.

08:58.912 --> 08:59.911
Are you sure?

08:59.913 --> 09:01.413
Well, the new network name is,

09:01.415 --> 09:05.283
"Ha ha ha, now I've got you,"
so...

09:06.754 --> 09:09.955
It's either Sheldon
or Gargamel from <i>The Smurfs.</i>

09:09.957 --> 09:11.990
What a jerk.

09:11.992 --> 09:14.493
You're good at revenge;
how do we get him back?

09:14.495 --> 09:16.194
Well, my go-to move is usually

09:16.196 --> 09:17.696
sleep with the
person's boyfriend,

09:17.698 --> 09:21.299
but I kind of feel like
I'm already doing that.

09:27.941 --> 09:29.441
Sheldon, I know what you did,

09:29.443 --> 09:32.010
now change the password back.

09:32.012 --> 09:35.881
Well, powder me in sugar
and call me a donut,

09:35.883 --> 09:39.384
if it isn't Leonard Hofstadter.

09:39.386 --> 09:42.320
Sheldon, I'm warning you,
I can play this game, too.

09:42.322 --> 09:44.189
If it's like
your 3-D chess game,

09:44.191 --> 09:46.825
then you're out of your length,
width and depth.

09:47.728 --> 09:50.128
Amy, get the Neosporin,

09:50.130 --> 09:52.631
somebody just got burned.

09:53.433 --> 09:55.901
All right, I tried.

09:55.903 --> 09:58.136
"All right,
I tried."

09:58.138 --> 10:00.839
That should be the title
of your autobiography.

10:02.075 --> 10:05.177
Ooh, a second-degree burn.

10:06.113 --> 10:07.279
I've got the Neosporin.

10:07.281 --> 10:09.080
Who got hurt?

10:09.082 --> 10:10.448
It's a good thing you're cute.

10:18.892 --> 10:22.227
So, I was reading how it's
a good idea for new parents

10:22.229 --> 10:24.396
to take an
infant CPR class.

10:24.398 --> 10:26.865
Yeah, we've been
meaning to do that.

10:26.867 --> 10:29.634
Oh, I know a CPR instructor
who'll come to the house.

10:29.636 --> 10:31.570
- That'd be great.
- I'll give him a call.

10:31.572 --> 10:33.271
We met when I was sleeping
on the beach

10:33.273 --> 10:34.806
and he thought I was dead.

10:37.611 --> 10:39.044
Thank you again
for cooking.

10:39.046 --> 10:41.413
It's getting tough for me
to be on my feet all day.

10:41.415 --> 10:44.282
You just kick back and relax;
I've got it all under control.

10:45.152 --> 10:47.385
Although it was
already under control.

10:48.922 --> 10:51.156
I'm sorry,
you mumbled something?

10:52.025 --> 10:53.792
It's just that

10:53.794 --> 10:55.827
they've had plenty of help.

10:55.829 --> 10:58.096
Well, you know what they say--
it takes a village.

10:58.098 --> 11:00.565
Well, they already
had a village.

11:01.802 --> 11:03.602
I noticed the village
couldn't find time

11:03.604 --> 11:05.136
to put the crib together.

11:05.138 --> 11:06.371
Yeah, well, maybe

11:06.373 --> 11:08.139
the village was too busy
checking out

11:08.141 --> 11:09.908
the local Montessori school
for the new arrival.

11:09.910 --> 11:10.942
You mean the one

11:10.944 --> 11:12.878
with the empty beer bottles
in the sandbox?

11:12.880 --> 11:14.579
We'll pass, thank you.

11:16.149 --> 11:19.050
Do something, Batman.

11:23.857 --> 11:26.057
Hey.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.561
What do you think you're doing?

11:29.563 --> 11:32.597
Separating my delicates.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.567
This is the level
you're stooping to.

11:35.569 --> 11:36.534
No.

11:36.536 --> 11:41.606
This is the level
I am stooping to.

11:45.045 --> 11:49.881
I believe that is flag
to crotch four, checkmate.

11:50.684 --> 11:53.818
Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:06.971 --> 12:07.971
Hey, what's up?

12:08.039 --> 12:09.439
I'm here to put
the crib together.

12:09.441 --> 12:11.274
Ooh, sorry, I already did it.

12:11.276 --> 12:15.111
Oh, I don't know if you realize
this, but I bought that crib.

12:15.113 --> 12:19.515
Oh, yeah, I read about that
on WhoGivesACrap.com

12:21.319 --> 12:22.719
Why are you being like this?

12:23.788 --> 12:25.655
Because I love
Howard and Bernadette

12:25.657 --> 12:29.058
and if I want to keep mooching
off them, I need to be helpful.

12:29.928 --> 12:30.993
Hey, this pregnancy had

12:30.995 --> 12:32.028
an emotionally-needy third wheel

12:32.030 --> 12:34.163
way before you came along.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.500
Why can't there be four wheels?

12:37.502 --> 12:40.069
Is this what you do
when I'm not here,

12:40.071 --> 12:42.305
make really good points?

12:42.307 --> 12:46.109
Look-Look, just come in and
help me build a baby swing.

12:46.111 --> 12:47.910
Thank you.

12:47.912 --> 12:51.114
If you're hungry you can eat
your takeout; nobody touched it.

12:53.284 --> 12:54.751
I think I'm gonna
go for a run.

12:54.753 --> 12:56.085
You want to come?

12:56.087 --> 12:58.988
No, last time that old lady
in the park kept screaming,

12:58.990 --> 13:01.591
"Watch out, he's
right behind you."

13:05.296 --> 13:06.829
Hello?

13:06.831 --> 13:10.166
Hey, how you doing?

13:11.002 --> 13:13.269
Uh, can I help you?

13:13.271 --> 13:16.939
I don't think so,
but you're sweet for asking.

13:17.776 --> 13:18.841
What-What are you doing

13:18.843 --> 13:20.343
in our apartment?

13:20.345 --> 13:24.714
Oh, I rented a room from
your neighbor, the tall guy...

13:24.716 --> 13:27.417
dressed like a little boy.

13:28.253 --> 13:29.786
Unbelievable.

13:29.788 --> 13:32.388
Okay, uh, I don't know
what he told you,

13:32.390 --> 13:34.090
but you can't stay here.

13:34.092 --> 13:36.526
So, there are fresh linens
on the bed and...

13:36.528 --> 13:37.493
Oh.

13:37.495 --> 13:39.395
Well, now, I see
you've met Theodore.

13:41.032 --> 13:43.866
Theodore, these
are your new roommates,

13:43.868 --> 13:45.201
Leonard and Penny.

13:45.203 --> 13:46.536
They're very honest,

13:46.538 --> 13:48.104
but I would not leave
cash lying around.

13:48.106 --> 13:50.173
Sheldon,

13:50.175 --> 13:51.574
what do you think
you're doing?

13:51.576 --> 13:53.910
My room is paid up
until the end of the month,

13:53.912 --> 13:55.311
so I can do
with it whatever

13:55.313 --> 13:56.579
I please, which includes

13:56.581 --> 13:59.148
renting it out
for a dollar a night.

13:59.150 --> 14:00.983
It's like the '40s again.

14:04.155 --> 14:06.856
Anyway, I'll leave you be.

14:06.858 --> 14:08.057
I have to... oh, oh!

14:08.059 --> 14:10.159
He's expecting a newspaper
in the morning.

14:10.161 --> 14:12.361
Apparently,
they still make them.

14:12.363 --> 14:15.097
All right, Sheldon,
this is over the line.

14:15.099 --> 14:16.065
That's true,

14:16.067 --> 14:18.167
but had I done
something under the line,

14:18.169 --> 14:19.669
there wouldn't be a man
in your kitchen

14:19.671 --> 14:21.938
who can't produce
a single form of ID.

14:21.940 --> 14:23.806
Oh, oh, I have a receipt
from a blood bank.

14:24.409 --> 14:26.876
I'm O-negative.

14:30.081 --> 14:32.815
And now you know as much
about him as I do.

14:36.187 --> 14:38.221
Oh, hey, Bernadette,

14:38.223 --> 14:40.256
the swing comes
with two different mobiles.

14:40.258 --> 14:44.126
The giraffes are pretty cute,
what do you think?

14:44.128 --> 14:45.862
Great, go with the giraffes.

14:45.864 --> 14:47.096
Although...

14:47.098 --> 14:49.432
the high contrast
of zebra stripes might provide

14:49.434 --> 14:51.534
better stimulus
for a developing baby.

14:52.604 --> 14:55.972
Yeah, you're probably right,
go with the zebras.

14:55.974 --> 14:57.773
Good choice, boss.

15:00.144 --> 15:02.812
At least my nose
is naturally brown.

15:06.584 --> 15:09.051
Hey, could you please go
to the market for me?

15:09.053 --> 15:10.920
Get Stuart or Raj to do it.

15:10.922 --> 15:13.656
Howie, they've been doing
everything for you.

15:13.658 --> 15:14.957
Mm, I know.

15:14.959 --> 15:17.493
It's really making me
lose respect for both of them.

15:18.296 --> 15:20.229
Please just go to the store.

15:20.231 --> 15:22.932
Fine.

15:22.934 --> 15:25.368
Who wants to drive me
to the store?

15:25.370 --> 15:26.903
- Me!
- I'll do it!

15:26.905 --> 15:27.970
Take Raj.

15:27.972 --> 15:31.407
Stuart is supposed
to paint my toenails.

15:42.186 --> 15:43.185
What do you think?

15:43.187 --> 15:44.520
Should we go to a hotel?

15:44.522 --> 15:46.522
And just leave
him here alone?

15:46.524 --> 15:47.990
Okay, I'll go to a hotel.

15:47.992 --> 15:50.459
Text me in the morning
if you're still alive.

15:53.097 --> 15:54.130
Uh, Theodore,

15:54.132 --> 15:55.364
how long

15:55.366 --> 15:57.833
are you planning
to stay exactly?

15:57.835 --> 16:00.336
Oh, thanks to the coins
I found in your couch,

16:00.338 --> 16:02.905
a day longer than I thought.

16:03.708 --> 16:05.541
This is ridiculous.

16:08.246 --> 16:10.346
I like the painting.

16:10.348 --> 16:12.448
Is that your mom?

16:17.055 --> 16:19.822
Sheldon, get out here!

16:20.625 --> 16:22.224
Will you keep it down?

16:22.226 --> 16:23.893
What kind of vengeful
bed and breakfast

16:23.895 --> 16:26.062
do you think I'm running?

16:26.064 --> 16:28.631
We lived together
13 years.

16:28.633 --> 16:29.932
How can you be so awful to me?

16:29.934 --> 16:31.367
I'm being awful?!

16:31.369 --> 16:33.436
You're the one who went
out of your way to hurt me.

16:33.438 --> 16:34.670
Because you were
being selfish.

16:34.672 --> 16:36.973
Dividing our belongings
is difficult.

16:36.975 --> 16:38.774
Why?
I said I didn't care!

16:38.776 --> 16:40.242
Excuse me.

16:40.244 --> 16:43.412
It's none of my business,
but it sounds like a lot

16:43.414 --> 16:47.583
of this anger
is coming from love.

16:49.420 --> 16:51.954
Yeah, thanks,
but nobody asked you.

16:51.956 --> 16:55.124
Well, I'm just gonna
keep on talking.

16:55.994 --> 16:57.259
Seems like, with Sheldon

16:57.261 --> 17:02.164
moving out, you're
in a new phase of your lives

17:02.166 --> 17:03.666
and it's easier

17:03.668 --> 17:06.669
to fight than
to face the feelings

17:06.671 --> 17:09.571
that you have for one another.

17:10.974 --> 17:13.376
I think he might be right.

17:13.377 --> 17:15.344
Also, who is that?

17:16.547 --> 17:19.415
I have to admit,

17:19.416 --> 17:21.050
leaving you to
move in with Amy

17:21.051 --> 17:23.486
has been harder than
I thought it would be.

17:23.488 --> 17:25.121
Well, for me, too.

17:25.123 --> 17:27.056
It's not the same
with you gone.

17:27.058 --> 17:28.758
If you're looking for a new guy
to live with...

17:28.760 --> 17:30.526
-No!
- We're good. Thank you.

17:31.829 --> 17:34.497
So, no one's gonna
tell me? Okay.

17:34.499 --> 17:35.831
Leonard,

17:35.833 --> 17:37.233
I would like us
to stop fighting

17:37.235 --> 17:38.601
about our possessions.

17:38.603 --> 17:40.236
Well, I'd like that, too.

17:40.238 --> 17:43.572
In fact, I want you to
keep the apartment flag,

17:43.574 --> 17:44.874
and I'm not
just saying that

17:44.876 --> 17:47.410
because it touched
your genitals.

17:47.412 --> 17:48.811
You promise?

17:48.813 --> 17:50.012
I do.

17:50.014 --> 17:51.647
And to show you that there
are no hard feelings,

17:51.649 --> 17:55.518
I am willing to rub my
genitals on it as well.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.919
Well...

17:56.921 --> 18:01.257
if we're rubbing genitals
on things, that's where I shine.

18:11.477 --> 18:14.111
Little lower to the left.

18:14.113 --> 18:16.981
A little more.

18:16.983 --> 18:18.416
Is it good?

18:18.418 --> 18:21.118
No, still hideous.

18:24.524 --> 18:27.057
Well, I'm sure
at some point,

18:27.059 --> 18:28.659
we won't even
notice it's there.

18:28.661 --> 18:29.627
Yeah, you'd think that,

18:29.629 --> 18:31.228
but after a while it starts

18:31.230 --> 18:33.731
showing up in your dreams.

18:34.567 --> 18:36.767
I think it brings
the room together.

18:39.439 --> 18:41.472
Hey, tomorrow who wants
to paint the nursery?

18:41.474 --> 18:42.339
I'll do it.

18:42.341 --> 18:43.474
Why do you get to do it?

18:43.476 --> 18:44.508
I'm the artist.

18:44.510 --> 18:45.609
Just because you're starving

18:45.611 --> 18:47.545
doesn't make you an artist.

18:47.547 --> 18:50.815
Just because I look sickly
doesn't mean I'm starving.

18:50.817 --> 18:52.783
Howard!

18:53.886 --> 18:56.654
Guys, you heard her,
go see what she wants.

18:58.524 --> 19:00.324
I think I'm in labor.

19:00.326 --> 19:01.659
Oh, oh, okay.

19:01.661 --> 19:04.361
Okay, uh, uh, uh,
I can do this.

19:04.363 --> 19:05.496
We have a plan.

19:05.498 --> 19:07.565
Somebody please
tell me the plan.

19:07.567 --> 19:09.800
I'll get the hospital bag.
I'll pull the van up.

19:09.802 --> 19:10.868
Meet you outside in 2 minutes.

19:10.870 --> 19:13.337
Team Baby, go!

19:15.508 --> 19:16.674
I love you.

19:16.676 --> 19:18.642
I love you, too.

19:19.564 --> 19:22.565
Are we hugging or having a baby?
Let's go!
