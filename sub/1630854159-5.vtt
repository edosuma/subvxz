WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:04.172
All right.
Now turn right.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.674
Are you sure
you were born in March?

00:06.674 --> 00:09.577
Oh, I think she knows what month
she was born in.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.412
Who are you, little one?

00:11.412 --> 00:14.014
Are you here of
your own free will,

00:14.014 --> 00:16.517
or are you a droid
locked in servitude?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.386
She doesn't even know
what planet she's on.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.488
Okay, that's fair.
But the state of California

00:20.488 --> 00:22.790
did require her to show
her birth certificate

00:22.790 --> 00:24.024
when she got
that driver's license.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.493
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just saying--

00:25.493 --> 00:28.062
You know, Pisces are normally
way too gentle

00:28.062 --> 00:30.464
to go on a drunken
vandalism spree.

00:30.464 --> 00:33.033
There's nothing normal about
the people we interact with.

00:33.033 --> 00:37.004
You are destined for more
than this, little one.

00:37.004 --> 00:40.074
Do you want to know a secret?

00:40.074 --> 00:43.477
I'm not really
Danielle Vonderclomp.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.647
My parents adopted me
from a Lithuanian orphanage

00:46.647 --> 00:48.182
when I was 2.

00:48.182 --> 00:51.285
My history,
shrouded in darkness.

00:51.285 --> 00:53.987
I believe that I am
secretly a princess

00:53.987 --> 00:57.858
destined to go back home
one day to rule.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.227
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.994
Your Highness,
are you saying

01:00.994 --> 01:03.297
your parents just made up
a birthday for you?

01:03.297 --> 01:05.333
Well, duh.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.234
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
whoa, oh, oh ♪
Don't.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.335
I told you so.
Please don't.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.837
She's a Leo, for sure.
I said don't.

01:09.837 --> 01:13.774

I swear I looked here.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.717
So, today's the day?

01:23.717 --> 01:26.120
It is. And...?

01:26.120 --> 01:28.556
And... great.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.293
You think I'm going
back to work too soon?

01:32.293 --> 01:36.063
I voiced my opinion,
and I respect your decision.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.898
Right. It's just that...

01:37.898 --> 01:40.033
Well, technically,
you were dead.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.870
I mean, you were gone,
and they brought you back.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.405
I just think
maybe it might

01:44.405 --> 01:46.707
take you more than a week
to get past that.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.976
Yeah, but it's not like
that's the first time.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.712
Sure, but--
Whoa, wait. What?

01:51.712 --> 01:53.080
You've been dead before?

01:53.080 --> 01:54.515
I knew
this was a bad idea.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.617
We should've used a service
to cover Justine's vacation.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.319
Your mom just wants
to spend more time with Jack.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.321
Why hire a temp nanny
when he's got family?

02:00.321 --> 02:02.656
Because a nanny
would be on time.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.293
I have to go.
Can you stay until she shows?

02:05.293 --> 02:07.195
Yeah. Go.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.031
Mami!

02:11.031 --> 02:12.132
Huh?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.534
Call 911!

02:13.534 --> 02:17.338
We should let Marshall
pick every restaurant

02:17.338 --> 02:19.507

the sergeant's meetings.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.209
Did you try that
breakfast sandwich?

02:21.209 --> 02:23.411
No. Ashley's got me on
this Whole30 thing.

02:23.411 --> 02:24.545
No bread.

02:24.545 --> 02:27.014
Oh, you're missing out.
Hey, Smitty.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.349
Yeah, Sarge?

02:28.349 --> 02:30.518
You can't park your
personal vehicle in spots

02:30.518 --> 02:32.353
designated for marked units.

02:32.353 --> 02:35.623
The RV isn't my vehicle,
it's my house.

02:35.623 --> 02:38.459
♪VanLife.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.494
You can't park your house
in marked spots either.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.999
Any chance he retires soon?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.035
You aren't that lucky.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.805
Dr. Green: Okay.
She needs a couple stitches,

02:51.805 --> 02:53.341
and I'd like to admit her,

02:53.341 --> 02:56.009
get a CAT scan to make sure
nothing more serious presents.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.345
Of course.

02:57.345 --> 02:58.579
Thank you, Doctor.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.347
Are you single?

02:59.347 --> 03:00.581
Mom!

03:00.581 --> 03:01.882
Because I have four sons.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.284
One's a priest,

03:03.284 --> 03:06.053
but the others could use
a successful, young,

03:06.053 --> 03:07.988
beautiful woman
like yourself.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.823
That's sweet, but I'm engaged.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.125
Oh, congratulations.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.794
You let me know
if it doesn't work out.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.196
Sure thing.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.065
Mom.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.833
I need you to tell me
what happened.
I'm fine.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.702
Where's my grandbaby?
At home with Wesley.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.170
Well, let's go see them.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.072
The doctors are overreacting.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.308
You're not leaving
until they clear you.

03:27.308 --> 03:30.077
I once worked an eight-hour
shift with a broken wrist.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.312
Last time I heard that story,

03:31.312 --> 03:33.481
it was a six-hour shift
with a sprain.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.716
Point is, I'm tougher
than I look.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.351
I know how tough you are,

03:37.351 --> 03:39.152
but I need you
to tell me what happened.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.020
Nothing.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.624
I don't want
to freak you out.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.626
I'm a cop.
Nothing freaks me out.

03:45.626 --> 03:49.463
I was on my way to see you
when a big man grabbed me.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.232
I whacked him with my purse.
He threw me down.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.567
What aren't you telling me?

03:53.567 --> 03:54.402
Nothing.

03:56.737 --> 04:00.040
I'm sure
it's a misunderstanding. Mom.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.576
"Tell your son
he's out of time."

04:02.576 --> 04:03.911
Out of time for what?

04:03.911 --> 04:05.313
I don't know.
That's all he said.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.214
Which son?
I don't know!

04:08.949 --> 04:11.519
It has to be
a misunderstanding.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.854
Your brothers
are all such good boys.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.056
My brothers used to
stuff me in a pillowcase

04:16.056 --> 04:17.325
and drag me around
the neighborhood.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.793
And look how tough
it made you.

04:19.793 --> 04:20.694
They did you a favor.

04:22.396 --> 04:25.232
What's with all these diets
Ashley has you on?

04:25.232 --> 04:26.667

heart trouble.

to the hospital.

What happened?

05:16.216 --> 05:18.552
He must have been going
at least 70.

05:18.552 --> 05:21.522

parked cars, flipped.

All right.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.577
And what do we do next?

05:43.577 --> 05:45.479
We, uh, wait for backup
to secure the scene,

05:45.479 --> 05:47.548
then head to the hospital.
Why?

05:47.548 --> 05:49.950
Well, a death investigation
triggers different protocols.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.819
We go with the victim
in case he dies.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.153
Nicely done.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.623
How's your mom?

05:55.623 --> 05:57.658
Okay, I think.

05:57.658 --> 06:00.394
She keeps going on about
how it was a misunderstanding.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.396
Uh, you think one of
your brothers is in trouble?

06:02.396 --> 06:04.131
It wouldn't be
the first time.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.699
If one of them is a reason
for Mom's attack,

06:05.699 --> 06:07.635
I will rain down
hell's own fury.

06:07.635 --> 06:10.137
Okay. So, technically,
this can't be your case.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.640
I know. It's your case.
I'm not even here.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.175
Good, because it's
a major conflict of interest

06:15.175 --> 06:17.511
for you to investigate
your own brothers.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.746
I know.
Plus, if I do it,

06:18.746 --> 06:19.647
I might end up
killing one of them.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.048
Huh.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.883
And here
they come now.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.619
That's Damian,
my oldest brother.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.489
Also known as Father Lopez
or Father D.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.323
Amen to that.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.892
He started a nonprofit
teaching job skills

06:31.892 --> 06:33.661
to former gang members,

06:33.661 --> 06:36.363
so he's got just as many friends
as he does enemies.

06:36.363 --> 06:38.832
And that's
Benjamin "Benny" Lopez.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.734
Second oldest.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.236
He was Gordon Gekko
for Halloween from
the time he was 3.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.639
When he was 12,
he opened an investment account

06:45.639 --> 06:47.074
using lawnmower earnings

06:47.074 --> 06:49.042
and our abuelita's
Social Security number.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.744
Her portfolio
is better than mine.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.380
And that's Cruz.
Middle child.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.148
In and out of rehab
since he was 18.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.651
Just can't seem
to get it together.

06:57.651 --> 07:00.220
When I became a cop, my mom made
me promise to never arrest him.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.822
I thought you had
four brothers.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.056
Bruno's the youngest,

07:03.056 --> 07:04.324
but he's been in New York
since college.

07:04.324 --> 07:05.993
I really don't think
he's involved.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.795
Angela,
what's going on?

07:07.795 --> 07:09.162
Mom's in the hospital.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.564
She okay?
Wait. What happened?

07:10.564 --> 07:11.832
Well, why didn't you have us
meet there?

07:11.832 --> 07:13.133
Your mother was
attacked this morning

07:13.133 --> 07:14.835
on her way
to Angela's house.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.504
She suffered
a blow to the head.

07:16.504 --> 07:17.971
The doctors are
running some tests.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.172
Who would attack Mom?

07:19.172 --> 07:20.340
Hold on.
Is that why we're here?

07:20.340 --> 07:22.142
What, you think
it's our fault?

07:22.142 --> 07:24.645
The assailant said, "Tell your
son he's running out of time."

07:24.645 --> 07:26.647
So, yeah, I think one of you
is at fault,

07:26.647 --> 07:28.716
and no one's leaving
until I get answers.

07:28.716 --> 07:31.118
All right, if one of you
wants to make this easy

07:31.118 --> 07:33.987
and just confess,
that would be awesome.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.325
All right, then.
Hard way it is.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.994
Come on.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.830
Really?

07:47.835 --> 07:49.236
What is this?

07:52.372 --> 07:54.407
I'm just gonna move you
real fast.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.579
That's an exit wound.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.550
Control, Engine 53.

08:02.550 --> 08:05.018
Advise Saint Stephen
we have a gunshot victim.

08:05.018 --> 08:08.055
ETA six minutes,
and advise PD we have a GSW.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.457
Oh! Calm down, buddy.

08:10.457 --> 08:11.491
We're almost at
the hospital.
Oh!

08:11.491 --> 08:12.860
It's gonna be okay.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.871
I thought I fixed it.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.205
It's fine.
You hold pressure.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.039
I'll go get
another gurney.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.384
No!

09:07.514 --> 09:08.481
Greg!

09:13.286 --> 09:14.722
What happened?

09:14.722 --> 09:16.690
Our patient must've
attacked him.
Why?

09:16.690 --> 09:19.627
I found a gunshot wound
when I was cleaning him up.

09:19.627 --> 09:20.694
He would know the hospital
would have to report

09:20.694 --> 09:22.963
that gunshot to the police.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.231
He's gone inside
the hospital.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.699
We need to
lock it down now.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.076
Security guard.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.378
Hi. John Nolan.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.413
Jasper Lee.
Hospital's locked down.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.149
All incoming calls
are being rerouted.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.516
Okay, we're gonna have to
post up at all the exits,

09:43.516 --> 09:45.118
check everyone's I.D.
before they leave.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.453
Does that mean you've got
an I.D. on this guy?

09:46.453 --> 09:48.488
Rob Lukasey.
He left his wallet in the car.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.190
A laundry list
of priors.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.960
Uh, Celina, can you get him
a photo to distribute?
Will do.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.294
He's in
bad shape.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.296
His first priority will be
patching himself up.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.464
Well, we can put
extra security

09:57.464 --> 09:58.732
on the pharmacy
and storage rooms.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.801
But the truth is,

10:00.801 --> 10:02.335
there's medical supplies
everywhere in here.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.871
I got more officers
coming to help,

10:03.871 --> 10:04.838
but I'm sure I don't
have to tell you

10:04.838 --> 10:06.006
what a big job
this is gonna be.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.709
8 floors, 600 beds,
34 operating rooms.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.711
In our simulations,
a thorough search

10:10.711 --> 10:11.712
takes five hours.

10:11.712 --> 10:12.512
Hmm.
Well, let's get to it.

10:12.512 --> 10:13.714
Let's do it.

10:13.714 --> 10:14.882
Okay.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.616
Agh. Nolan.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.685
You all right?

10:17.685 --> 10:18.819
Yeah, uh, fine.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.320
What-- What's
the lockdown status?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.222
Uh, we got, uh, everything
checked off the list, but--

10:22.222 --> 10:24.524
No, call Grey and tell him
Tim is not here as a supervisor.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.826
He's here as a patient.

10:25.826 --> 10:28.495
I told you,
I'm fine. Agh!
Oh, my God.

10:28.495 --> 10:29.897
Ohh, okay.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.464
Okay, I'm not fine.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.700
Get me a doctor.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.870
"Tell your son
he's out of time."

10:36.870 --> 10:38.305
Any idea what that means?

10:38.305 --> 10:41.074
No. No. If I did,
I would tell you.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.844
Ask him
about his record.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.746
<i>I was getting to that.</i>

10:45.746 --> 10:48.115
<i>So, you got a couple arrests
for public intoxication</i>

10:48.115 --> 10:51.184
and multiple DUIs.
Ancient history.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.954
I've been sober for one year
and 47 days today.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.357
Whoa.
What are you doing here?

10:57.357 --> 10:59.026
I'm representing
my client.

11:00.527 --> 11:01.628
What?

11:01.628 --> 11:03.496
Hey, Ange.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.399
You're not even
a defense attorney anymore.
Look, I know.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.201
This is my chance to get <i>one</i>
of your brothers to like me.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.837
They're never
gonna like you.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.571
Objection--
argumentative.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.741
Your mother-in-law is
in the hospital right now

11:13.741 --> 11:15.709
because of him.
Objection--
speculation.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.144
All right. Enough.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.245
You, sit down. Yeah.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.980
You, go back inside.

11:19.980 --> 11:20.748
All right.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.518
That was dope. Yeah.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.954
Can we get back on track?

11:26.954 --> 11:28.155
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.556
Look, I've been trying
to tell you,

11:29.556 --> 11:31.959
that last DUI was the best thing
to happen to me.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.560
I've been clean and sober
ever since.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.363
I understand you work with
a lot of ex-cons.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.799
Guilt by association.
Really, Detective?

11:38.799 --> 11:40.633
It's all right.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.870
My mission is to help people
get out of the gang life.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.839
What if one of the gangs
got tired of you interfering

11:45.839 --> 11:47.841
and decided
to send a message?

11:47.841 --> 11:50.177
By attacking my mother?

11:50.177 --> 11:52.245
No.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.181
The people
that I work with,

11:54.181 --> 11:55.315
they might not
always agree with me,

11:55.315 --> 11:58.218
but they respect
the collar.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.453
Even if they didn't,
they know my sister's a cop.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.621
<i>So if it's</i> not
<i>because of you,</i>

12:01.621 --> 12:04.224
which brother do you think
I should be focused on?

12:04.224 --> 12:05.658
Cruz, Clearly.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.394
Uh, sorry.

12:07.394 --> 12:11.664
I just need to
respond to this.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.301
As I was saying--

12:17.838 --> 12:19.339
A thousand apologies.
Uh--

12:21.875 --> 12:24.044
It never ends. Uh...

12:25.678 --> 12:27.280
Sorry.
No, you're not.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.951
Uh, what exactly is
your business, Mr. Lopez?

12:30.951 --> 12:32.552
Um...

12:32.552 --> 12:34.187
- I--
- Okay.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.190
Hey,
while I have you here,

12:37.190 --> 12:39.459
Angela's been
dragging her feet.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.828
We really gotta get
baby Jack baptized.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.796
No, you know, I just--

12:42.796 --> 12:45.232
I don't really want to
get in the middle of--
of what you guys have--

12:45.232 --> 12:47.234
Well, I know.
I know you're not Catholic.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.535
What's your
denomination?

12:49.669 --> 12:52.505
Protestant?

12:52.505 --> 12:53.573
I don't know.
Is that even an option?

12:53.573 --> 12:54.875
No.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.509
Oh.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.245
I'm gonna go
with Episcopalian. Sure.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.980
Look, I get it.
Your line of work,

12:59.980 --> 13:02.182
there is
a lot of money at stake.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.784
Might drive a person
to violence.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.387
The guys I work with,
they're not gonna
beat up someone's mom.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.722
That's too kind.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.992
They'll just sue you
to death.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.196
Can I just answer
that one--
Mnh-mnh.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.999
Ask him about
his credit report.

13:18.999 --> 13:22.135
I was getting to that.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.337
So, we ran
your credit report,

13:24.337 --> 13:26.539
and we saw that
you took out a $15,000 loan.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.208
You wanna tell us
about that?

13:28.208 --> 13:29.376
You don't have to
answer that.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.344
Yes, he does.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.580
<i>The loan is for
college classes.</i>

13:33.580 --> 13:35.382
<i>I'm getting my bachelor's
in accounting.</i>

13:35.382 --> 13:36.783
I didn't want to
say anything in case

13:36.783 --> 13:38.185
I couldn't hack it

13:38.185 --> 13:41.021
because I know
what you think of me.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.722
<i>And I know
I screwed up a lot.</i>

13:42.722 --> 13:44.157
I know you have no reason
to trust me.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.060
But whatever's going on,
it's not me.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.033
<i>Clear on floor two.</i>

13:53.033 --> 13:55.368
Floor three clear.
Heading to four.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.204
Okay. Thank you.

13:57.204 --> 13:59.706
Well, our suspect
killed a woman this morning.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.341
Home invasion
in West Hollywood.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.343
The victim's husband
managed to get the gun

14:03.343 --> 14:05.678
away from the suspect
and shoot him as he escaped.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.647
Okay, so he's looking at
life in prison if we catch him.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.449
<i>When</i> we catch him.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.984
God, I hate hospitals.

14:10.984 --> 14:11.952
Doesn't everyone?

14:11.952 --> 14:13.620
Yeah, I guess.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.787
Hey.
How's your partner?

14:14.787 --> 14:16.323
Shattered cheekbone.

14:16.323 --> 14:17.790
Plastic surgeon's
on his way in.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.059
You're going
back to work?

14:19.059 --> 14:20.560
I'll wait until he's
out of surgery. Right.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.861
I just found out
this morning

14:21.861 --> 14:23.563
Bailey has been dead
more than once.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.232
I know.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.666
I felt it when
I first met her.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.069
One had something to do with,
uh, flying?

14:29.069 --> 14:30.904
Wow. Yeah.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.739
A-A-A halo jump
went sideways.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.810
This is Nolan,
fourth floor west.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.879
We just found
the suspect's bloody clothes.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.449
Looks like he tried to patch
himself up best he could.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.451
Right, and then changed
into some scrubs.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.054
He'll still need an I.D.
in order to exit the building.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.388
Well, if he can break
into a house,

14:48.388 --> 14:50.323
he can steal
a staff I.D.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.160
I'll run down
all the gang members

14:53.160 --> 14:55.862
who work for
Father Lopez.

14:55.862 --> 14:58.198
Cruz agreed to
a drug test,

14:58.198 --> 15:00.633
so we should have those results
in a couple hours.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.070
For the first time in his life,
I actually think he's innocent.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.637
I've always been
so hard on him.

15:04.637 --> 15:05.905
Maybe if I had been
more supportive,

15:05.905 --> 15:08.308
he would have
gotten clean sooner.
You know better.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.143
Addicts only get clean
when they are ready.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.547
Oh. There you are.

15:14.547 --> 15:15.848
Uh, you okay?

15:15.848 --> 15:18.285
You're looking
a little shiny. Yeah.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.520
Yeah, I'm-- I'm fine.
I just feel a little warm.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.956
Look, I thought you should know,
hospital's locked down

15:22.956 --> 15:25.192
while they search
for a homicide suspect.

15:25.192 --> 15:26.559
I'm heading over
to supervise.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.728
There's a killer in the hospital
with my mother?

15:28.728 --> 15:30.998
Relax. She's fine.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.499
I assigned Thorsen
to watch her door.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.003
Hi, ma'am.
I'm Officer Aaron Thorsen.
Hm?

15:36.003 --> 15:37.337
I've been assigned
to keep you safe,

15:37.337 --> 15:38.305
and I just want
to let you know

15:38.305 --> 15:39.706
that there's nothing
to worry about.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.708
You are handsome.

15:43.676 --> 15:44.877
Thank you.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.980
Do you have any sisters?

15:46.980 --> 15:48.481
No, I'm an only child.
Cousins?

15:49.983 --> 15:53.653
My second eldest son, Benny,
he is successful, sweet,

15:53.653 --> 15:55.122
goes to church on Sundays. Mm.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.524
But he needs a woman
to settle down with.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.493
Are you asking me to set up one
of my cousins with your son?
Mm-hmm.

16:00.493 --> 16:04.864
And in return, I will set you up
with my niece, Isabella.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.266
She's a professional dancer.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.203
You got a picture?
Mm-hmm.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.907
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.011
It's probably
just a muscle spasm.

16:18.011 --> 16:18.811
You didn't have
to clock out.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.313
Of course I did.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.683
Oh, hey. I'm just
searching for bad guys.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.552
All clear here.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.554
Wait, so Nolan's leaving
someone on every floor?

16:27.554 --> 16:30.023
Yes. We've been cops
for more than 10 seconds.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.358
We can handle this.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.326
Hey, Doc,
what's the word?

16:33.326 --> 16:35.362
When we took that bullet out
a few years back,

16:35.362 --> 16:37.997
there was a-a fragment that was
too complicated to remove.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.067
I remember.
Bullet?

16:40.067 --> 16:42.402
I was shot.
It wasn't a big deal.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.637
I saved his life
first day on the job.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.173
It was a <i>huge</i> deal.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.974
Back to the fragment.

16:47.974 --> 16:50.377
The pain you're experiencing
is because the fragment

16:50.377 --> 16:52.179
has migrated closer
to your spinal column

16:52.179 --> 16:54.214
and is pressing up
against a nerve.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.848
We'll need to do surgery
to remove it.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.218
Okay.
Uh, when?

16:58.218 --> 17:00.653
Well, I mean, hold on.
Wh-What are the risks?

17:02.021 --> 17:04.524
Well, we are talking about
the spine, so...

17:04.524 --> 17:05.658
yes, it's risky.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.394
But it's laparoscopic.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.462
So if all goes well,
he'll be home by dinner.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.463
If?

17:10.463 --> 17:11.831
I know it's scary,

17:11.831 --> 17:14.033
but leaving the fragment
in place is much riskier.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.668
Well,
then we do surgery.

17:15.668 --> 17:16.903
Thank you.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.976
Uh...

17:23.976 --> 17:26.179
I'm gonna get back
to the search.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.185
South wing is clear.
Headed to north.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.857
Sir. Are you...?

17:37.857 --> 17:39.959
Oh, my-- Oh!

17:39.959 --> 17:41.494
I-- I need help
over here!

17:47.267 --> 17:49.169
Ah, good thing I was
on the Whole30 diet.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.304
That food poisoning
is no joke.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.642
Marshall can never pick
the breakfast place again.

17:55.642 --> 17:56.643
Never.

17:56.643 --> 17:57.844
Oh, no.

17:57.844 --> 17:58.978
This is kind of fun.

17:58.978 --> 17:59.812
It's like a sleepover.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.681
Oh, God.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.049
Should I call the nurse?

18:03.049 --> 18:04.717
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.354
You need to get back
to the station immediately.
What?

18:07.354 --> 18:08.555
What? Why?

18:08.555 --> 18:11.324
Because if we're both
out of commission...

18:11.324 --> 18:12.959
Based on seniority...

18:12.959 --> 18:14.427
Smitty's in charge.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.397
Oh.
Yeah.
You're still
standing there.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.132
Go.
Yeah.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.467
Hey, man.
All right, bro.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.507
Smitty.
Smitty!

18:27.507 --> 18:29.342
Hey!
Wha-- What's going on?

18:29.342 --> 18:30.977
Acting Sergeant Smitty.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.879
Right. Why is Casey Curtis
leaving the station?

18:32.879 --> 18:34.281
End of shift time off.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.715
When you're in charge,

18:35.715 --> 18:37.550
you can let all your friends
go home early.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.118
But we're short today.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.119
You know how many units
are attached

18:40.119 --> 18:40.953
to the hospital event, right?

18:40.953 --> 18:42.489
Self-care is important.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.990
Smitty--

18:45.057 --> 18:46.893
- Get out!
- All right!

18:46.893 --> 18:48.328
What the hell
is going on?

18:48.328 --> 18:49.996
We caught the guy who beat up
Father Lopez's mother.

18:51.998 --> 18:54.534
We heard what happened
to your mom and wanted to help.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.068
So you abducted a man?

18:56.068 --> 18:57.804
It was
a citizen's arrest.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.539
On what evidence?

18:59.539 --> 19:01.641
He's been talkin' smack about
Father Lopez for weeks!

19:01.641 --> 19:02.909
The whole hood
heard him.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.011
He's lucky
that's all I did.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.613
Hypocrite's sleeping
with my wife.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.483
With me, now.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.826
You're sleeping
with his wife?

19:19.826 --> 19:20.660
You're a priest.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.861
I know.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.032
I know.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.836
Been struggling
with my vows recently.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.504
Are you kidding me?

19:31.504 --> 19:34.474
Jumping to adultery
is more than just struggling.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.710
We all fall short
of the glory of God.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.647
But I really don't think Carmody
had anything to do with Mom.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.551
I have to look into it.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.354
You never know
what people are capable of.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.055
I didn't know you were
capable of this.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.230
You know,
with your injury,

19:57.230 --> 19:59.632
you could retire right now
if you wanted.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.335
She's right.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.403
Are you trying
to get rid of me?

20:03.403 --> 20:06.506
It's not a crazy idea.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.509
My dad waited too long
to call it quits.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.511
He can't do any of
the things he planned on.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.446
It's a good deal.

20:13.446 --> 20:18.618
Disability pay is the average of
your last three years of income,

20:18.618 --> 20:22.622
50% salary plus overtime.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.991
That's about 60%
of your current take home.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.393
And that's tax free, right?

20:26.393 --> 20:27.994
Yes, it is.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.297
Plus, my dad gets
a cost-of-living adjustment.

20:30.297 --> 20:34.000
That's a 3% raise every year,
for life.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.135
I never really
did the math before.

20:36.135 --> 20:39.639
Just think.
We both love to travel.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.208
I always did want to see a game
at every Major League stadium.

20:42.208 --> 20:45.312
W-We could even
move out of L.A.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.314
I mean, I can be
a lifeguard anywhere.

20:47.314 --> 20:48.415
Right? So long
as there's a beach.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.984
I hear Bali has
a bunch of those.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.620
That's true.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.221
This is so exciting.

20:55.221 --> 20:56.656
No, I haven't
decided anything.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.158
No, I know, but...

20:59.158 --> 21:01.027
Free money?

21:01.027 --> 21:02.529
You'd be crazy
not to, right?

21:02.529 --> 21:04.063
Hm.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.768
Anybody else hungry?

21:11.103 --> 21:13.039
Probably not the best time, right?

21:13.039 --> 21:14.574
I'll pass.

21:14.574 --> 21:18.010
I'm just gonna grab something
from the cafeteria.

21:18.010 --> 21:18.845
Bye.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.515
Just think about it.

21:22.515 --> 21:23.983
Okay.

21:27.554 --> 21:29.822
Have they
been assessed yet?

21:34.361 --> 21:36.963
Here's the thing.
Melody-- she's wonderful.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.531
I love her to death.
She's my favorite cousin.

21:38.531 --> 21:39.999
But?

21:39.999 --> 21:42.335
But I-I don't think
she's right for Cruz.

21:42.335 --> 21:43.536
You know, he needs
someone who's solid

21:43.536 --> 21:44.837
and is gonna call him
on his B.S.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.706
You're thinking Tara.

21:46.706 --> 21:47.907
You're not wrong.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.979
Okay, Angela just sent me
a photo of this guy Carmody.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.113
Is this the man
that attacked you?

21:54.113 --> 21:55.114
No.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.215
No?
Mnh-mnh.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.149
Oh.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.554
Okay, I told her that they're
gonna be releasing you soon,

22:01.554 --> 22:03.656
so she should be
on her way.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.792
Oh, hey, did you set up
Wesley and Lopez?

22:05.792 --> 22:08.127
No.
She never needed my help.

22:08.127 --> 22:10.530
She was born
knowing her own mind.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.632
Yeah, that sounds like Lopez.

22:14.367 --> 22:15.735
Can I see Isabella
one more time?

22:15.735 --> 22:17.036
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.740
Wow!
Yeah, I'm telling you.

22:20.740 --> 22:21.541
Very flexible.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.277
Clear.

22:25.277 --> 22:28.147
You know, cops spend an awful
lot of time in hospitals.

22:28.147 --> 22:29.315
Whatever
your aversion is,

22:29.315 --> 22:30.216
you're gonna have to
deal with it.

22:30.216 --> 22:31.784
I know.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.153
I have to ask--
You don't see dead people?

22:34.153 --> 22:36.022
No.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.790
I mean, who doesn't feel
a presence from time to time?

22:37.790 --> 22:38.991
Me.

22:38.991 --> 22:39.859
Most everyone I know.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.027
Yeah,
but I'm not crazy.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.630
I don't see dead people. Good.

22:43.630 --> 22:47.366
It's just that hospitals
remind me of my sister.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.301
When they found her,
she was in bad shape.

22:49.301 --> 22:52.739
She, uh,
held out for two weeks,

22:52.739 --> 22:54.807
and I visited every day.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.075
I'm sorry.

22:58.678 --> 22:59.378
Next floor?

22:59.378 --> 23:00.813
Yeah.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.560
She's one of the best
surgeons in the country.

23:16.262 --> 23:17.497
I'm not worried.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.365
It's okay if you are.

23:19.365 --> 23:22.702
Eh, it's just a little
spinal surgery, you know?

23:22.702 --> 23:24.136
Might be fine.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.338
Might be
paralyzed for life.

23:26.338 --> 23:28.741
Excited to find out which.

23:28.741 --> 23:32.278
I'm gonna go stretch
my legs while I still can.

23:32.278 --> 23:33.480
Agh.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.947
That's the spirit.

23:46.325 --> 23:47.860
Mm.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.238
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.383
Agh.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.384
Agh!

24:19.526 --> 24:20.493
It was the shooter.

24:20.493 --> 24:22.061
Don't try to move.
I can't.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.630
What happened?

24:23.630 --> 24:25.297
The fragment must've shifted
towards Tim's spinal cord,

24:25.297 --> 24:26.633
and that's what's causing
his paralysis.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.467
Can you tell my sister, please?

24:28.467 --> 24:29.869
Sure.

24:31.437 --> 24:33.640
Hey, do not tell Chen.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.041
She's got enough
on her plate.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.409
We need to get you
into surgery stat.

24:37.409 --> 24:38.277
Agh!

24:48.621 --> 24:50.056
If you two
hit it off...
Mm-hmm.

24:50.056 --> 24:52.191
...I expect you to name
your firstborn after me.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.360
Okay, that's a deal.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.729
Mom, are you setting up Aaron?
Yes.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.165
Don't you think he'd be perfect
for Isabella?

24:59.165 --> 25:01.568
Izzie's way out of his league.
No offense.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.402
No, I agree.

25:03.402 --> 25:05.137
Any news on Tim?
No.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.573
He's still in surgery
for about two more hours.

25:06.573 --> 25:07.574
Oh.

25:07.574 --> 25:08.975
Go join the manhunt.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.242
Okay.

25:12.411 --> 25:14.446
Your brothers texted me

25:14.446 --> 25:16.182
to say you interrogated them
at the station

25:16.182 --> 25:18.017
like common criminals.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.019
You know I don't like it when
you fight with your brothers.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.888
Mom,
you were assaulted.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.556
Aw.
You're lucky you're okay.

25:23.556 --> 25:25.992
But one of your sons
is in serious danger.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.393
And if there's something
you're not telling me,

25:27.393 --> 25:28.628
you're not
protecting them.

25:28.628 --> 25:29.862
You're leaving them
at risk.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.063
I told you everything.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.164
Tell me again.

25:34.100 --> 25:37.069
I went outside to wait
for my rideshare.

25:37.069 --> 25:39.038
Out of nowhere,
a man attacked me.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.506
I hit him
with my purse.

25:40.506 --> 25:42.675
He said,
"Tell your son"--
Back up.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.644
Rideshare?
What happened to your car?

25:44.644 --> 25:45.812
I gave it to Benny.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.279
What do you mean,
you gave it to Benny?

25:47.279 --> 25:48.781
He said he needed it.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.216
I didn't ask.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.821
<i>You've reached Benjamin Lopez.</i>

25:54.821 --> 25:57.023
<i>Leave a message.</i>

25:59.792 --> 26:01.828
Hey, how's Tim?

26:01.828 --> 26:02.995
Still in surgery.

26:02.995 --> 26:04.363
Is Benny still
at the station?

26:04.363 --> 26:05.865
No. He went to work.
Why?

26:05.865 --> 26:07.900
He lied.
He's having money problems.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.335
<i>I tried to call him,
but he's not answering.</i>

26:09.335 --> 26:10.737
We ran
his credit report.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.471
We didn't see
any outstanding loans.

26:12.471 --> 26:14.373
An enforcer
going after family?

26:14.373 --> 26:17.076
That's off-the-books debt.
He's into a loan shark.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.878
We need to find him
so I can kill him

26:18.878 --> 26:20.546
before
somebody else does.

26:21.648 --> 26:23.650
Jan.

26:23.650 --> 26:24.984
Where's everybody going?

26:24.984 --> 26:26.052
Pool party
at Mario's.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.654
No...
No.

26:27.654 --> 26:28.955
Uh, we don't have
the staff for that.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.289
Y-You have to stay.

26:30.289 --> 26:33.525
Well, Acting Sergeant Smitty
says we don't.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.697
Oh. Can you
talk to them?

26:37.697 --> 26:39.699
I believe it was Tim and Grey
who sent <i>you</i> back

26:39.699 --> 26:41.000
to rein in Smitty.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.368
They don't respect me,
but--

26:42.368 --> 26:44.403
What are you talking about?
You just saw. I--

26:44.403 --> 26:46.673
Yeah, that's because
Smitty told them to go home.

26:46.673 --> 26:48.741
You just have to tell them
something different.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.376
Hey.

26:50.376 --> 26:52.144
After everything
you have been through,

26:52.144 --> 26:54.480
how often you
have proven yourself,

26:54.480 --> 26:56.615
there is not a cop in here
who would not have your back

26:56.615 --> 26:58.450
if you asked.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.789
Uh, hey, guys,
listen up.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.657
I need your help.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.058
We have two sergeants
out of commission

27:06.058 --> 27:07.226
in the hospital
right now

27:07.226 --> 27:08.861
and a murder suspect
on the loose.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.297
That search has us
spread pretty thin.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.232
We need all hands on deck
right now.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.134
I'm sorry,
but the pool party,

27:15.134 --> 27:16.202
it has to wait.

27:19.571 --> 27:21.708
You got it, Chen.
All right.

27:21.708 --> 27:22.909
Let's go, guys.

27:22.909 --> 27:24.210
She needs us.
You heard her.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.478
Thank you, thank you.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.147
Thank you!

27:28.147 --> 27:30.516
So, does this mean
you're in charge now?

27:32.118 --> 27:34.020
Yeah, I guess so.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.723
Cool.
I'll be in the breakroom.

27:36.723 --> 27:39.658
Being in charge
is exhausting.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.235
Nolan!

27:53.239 --> 27:55.908
He cut the wire so the alarm
wouldn't go off.

27:55.908 --> 27:58.010
Nice catch.
I'll cover.

28:03.482 --> 28:04.984
I see blood.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.658
Should we split up?

28:12.658 --> 28:14.060
Well,
proper procedure says

28:14.060 --> 28:16.062
we stay within
40 feet of each other,

28:16.062 --> 28:17.196
hearing distance,

28:17.196 --> 28:18.965
just in case
anything goes wrong.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.032
If you'd rather
stick together--

28:20.032 --> 28:21.801
No. I can handle it.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.135
We got to find
this guy fast.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.403
All right.

28:24.403 --> 28:25.738
I'll go left.
You go right.

28:25.738 --> 28:26.806
We'll meet up back here.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.574
Copy.

28:58.537 --> 28:59.972
Jasper.

28:59.972 --> 29:03.109
Not a sound,
or I'll blow your head off.

29:16.522 --> 29:17.689
Celina!

29:25.832 --> 29:28.801
7-Adam-15, I have an officer
down and another one missing.

29:30.702 --> 29:32.304
7-Adam-15?

29:35.842 --> 29:37.476
7-Adam-15, I have
priority traffic.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.812
Be smart.

29:39.812 --> 29:40.880
Just keep moving...
<i>All units clear
the air for priority traffic.</i>

29:40.880 --> 29:42.381
...and everything will be fine.
<i>Adam-15 go.</i>

29:42.381 --> 29:43.983
<i>I can't raise
Officer Juarez on the radio.</i>

29:43.983 --> 29:45.985
<i>She may have been 2-0-7'd
but still in the hospital.</i>

29:45.985 --> 29:47.186
<i>I need additional units
to help search.</i>

29:47.186 --> 29:48.187
Turn that off.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.022
I said turn it off!
I did.

29:50.022 --> 29:52.158
<i>Where are we going?
To the ambulance bay?</i>

29:52.158 --> 29:53.559
<i>Just shut up
and keep moving.</i>

29:58.530 --> 30:00.132
Okay. Okay.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.568
Get in.
Get in.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.674
Oh.

30:10.142 --> 30:11.177
Just give me a minute.

30:11.177 --> 30:12.544
Look, there's no
happy endings here.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.013
You know that, right?
Shut up.

30:14.013 --> 30:15.381
You need to get
your wounds treated.

30:15.381 --> 30:16.482
You should have
kidnapped a doctor.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.616
Shut up.

30:17.616 --> 30:19.118
I just need
to catch my breath.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.720
Let me at least take a look
at your wounds.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.155
Nice try.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.324
Look...

30:25.324 --> 30:28.227
police officers have a sworn
responsibility to render aid,

30:28.227 --> 30:29.228
even to people
trying to kill them.

30:31.097 --> 30:33.065
Lift your shirt. Okay.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.168
All righty.

30:40.006 --> 30:42.541
Okay. Uh...

30:42.541 --> 30:44.476
Listen.
You need this.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.045
Okay?
These are antibiotics.

30:46.045 --> 30:46.979
You can see the label
right there.

30:46.979 --> 30:48.347
Oh, forget it.
We gotta go.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.815
It'll just take
two seconds.

30:49.815 --> 30:51.517
And your wounds are definitely
infected by this point.

30:51.517 --> 30:52.551
Just let me do this.

30:52.551 --> 30:55.487
Okay. Okay.

30:55.487 --> 30:56.488
Come on. Okay.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.157
Let's go. Okay.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.628
Let me see.

31:05.797 --> 31:07.066
Okay.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.068
Now you're gonna
drive us out of here.

31:09.068 --> 31:10.069
Let's go.

31:10.069 --> 31:12.571
Okay. All righty.

31:22.281 --> 31:23.649
Aah!
Whoa!

31:32.791 --> 31:33.792
What are you doing?

31:33.792 --> 31:34.760
Just give it a second.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.264
Give what a second?

31:39.865 --> 31:41.167
How did you manage that?

31:41.167 --> 31:43.202
I showed him
the antibiotic,

31:43.202 --> 31:45.737
but then with a little
sleight of hand, morphine.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.406
Impressive.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.241
My sister and I used to do
these little magic shows.

31:50.476 --> 31:51.477
I'll bet
they were amazing.

31:51.477 --> 31:52.878
It was.

31:53.980 --> 31:55.447
Should be good to go.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.966
Am I under arrest?

32:13.966 --> 32:15.901
Depends.
You got a permit?

32:16.902 --> 32:18.870
Yeah.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.672
Back at the house.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.341
What are you doing here,
Benny?

32:22.341 --> 32:25.644
Are you asking as a cop
or as my sister?

32:25.644 --> 32:27.146
I'm asking as a sister.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.015
I'm listening as a cop.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.785
I bought some stocks
on a margin.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.354
The stocks went south.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.489
Margin got called.

32:37.489 --> 32:38.624
I didn't have it.

32:38.624 --> 32:39.825
How much?

32:39.825 --> 32:42.061
500 grand. Hmm.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.697
I sold everything
I could get my hands on.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.133
I was still a hundred short.

32:47.133 --> 32:48.900
So you went
to a loan shark?

32:48.900 --> 32:51.403
I know I screwed up.
I can fix it.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.072
No.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.873
You're gonna
let us handle it.

32:54.873 --> 32:57.609
What is this loan shark's name,
and where can we find him?

33:01.880 --> 33:03.649
Anyone ever tell you
not to lend to a guy

33:03.649 --> 33:06.018
whose sister
is a cop?

33:06.018 --> 33:08.220
Detectives.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.189
I haven't done
anything illegal.

33:10.189 --> 33:13.459
Just a legitimate loan
to a guy who's down on his luck.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.027
Well, your legitimate
collection agent

33:15.027 --> 33:16.528
landed my mom
in the hospital.

33:16.528 --> 33:17.963
Emilia wasn't kidding
when she said

33:17.963 --> 33:19.231
she got you
with her purse.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.167
You are under arrest
for assault,

33:21.167 --> 33:24.002
with an enhancement
for elder abuse.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.904
Don't mess with the Lopez women.
It doesn't end well.

33:40.986 --> 33:43.589
The doctor said they got
the bullet fragment.

33:45.057 --> 33:47.526
There's nothing
to worry about.

33:47.526 --> 33:48.494
That's great.

33:50.496 --> 33:53.031
I never thought I'd be so happy
to feel pain in my life.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.404
You okay?

33:58.404 --> 34:00.172
No.

34:02.241 --> 34:04.976
There's something
I have to tell you.

34:04.976 --> 34:06.878
Ash...

34:06.878 --> 34:10.616
I spent my whole life
worrying about my dad.

34:10.616 --> 34:14.153
If he was late
getting home,

34:14.153 --> 34:15.821
Mom would pretend
everything was fine,

34:15.821 --> 34:19.057
but I know
she was terrified.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.660
When I saw you wheeled
into surgery,

34:21.660 --> 34:25.063
I realized...

34:25.063 --> 34:27.766
I can't do that again.

34:29.335 --> 34:32.371
Are-- Are y-you
breaking up with me?

34:36.708 --> 34:38.744
I'm sorry.

34:40.011 --> 34:41.547
I just got out of surgery.

34:41.547 --> 34:44.550
I know.

34:44.550 --> 34:48.187
I thought I'd get it in
before the anesthesia wore off.

34:50.389 --> 34:53.659
I...still love you.

34:53.659 --> 34:58.964
I'll probably be in love with
you for longer than I'd like.

34:58.964 --> 35:02.468
And if there was any chance
you were going to retire...

35:08.006 --> 35:10.209
I know.

35:12.077 --> 35:13.612
Can I get you anything?

35:16.315 --> 35:18.350
No.

35:18.350 --> 35:22.754
Okay.
I'll go, then.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.308
So, now how do you feel
about hospitals?

35:42.308 --> 35:44.510
I love them.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.811
Nah, today was great.
You're good to go.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.813
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

35:47.813 --> 35:50.716
You know, that, uh,
morphine move was very smart.

35:50.716 --> 35:51.717
I would not have
thought of that.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.719
Thank you. Uh...

35:53.719 --> 35:55.687
What is it?

35:55.687 --> 35:56.955
Oh, you're gonna
think I'm crazy.

35:56.955 --> 35:57.989
No, never.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.858
It was my sister's idea.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.560
Oh.
Mm.

36:01.560 --> 36:05.497
As in you saw her or...?

36:05.497 --> 36:07.466
No.

36:07.466 --> 36:08.467
I can't really explain it.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.469
I-I feel like
she was with me.

36:10.469 --> 36:11.570
It's weird.

36:11.570 --> 36:14.806
Oh, well, I think that's
a-- a lovely thought,

36:14.806 --> 36:17.676
as long as there were no,
you know,

36:17.676 --> 36:18.977
auditory hallucinations--

36:18.977 --> 36:20.145
No.
I had to ask.

36:25.484 --> 36:26.985
Oh.

36:26.985 --> 36:28.220
Uh, Watch Commander's office.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.121
Sergeant Grey is unavailable.

36:30.121 --> 36:31.657
End of shift is denied and--

36:34.192 --> 36:35.227
Sgt. Grey:
Hey, there you are.

36:35.227 --> 36:36.895
I was just calling.

36:36.895 --> 36:37.729
Hey.

36:37.729 --> 36:39.665
So, how'd it go?

36:39.665 --> 36:40.999
It was great.

36:40.999 --> 36:43.034
It was...

36:43.034 --> 36:45.404
I just spoke with
the Communications Supervisor.

36:45.404 --> 36:49.107
Said you did a masterful job
managing calls

36:49.107 --> 36:50.442
with half
the normal staff.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.611
Hmm.
Thank you.

36:52.611 --> 36:55.281
I am so ready to give you
your job back.

36:56.782 --> 36:58.149
Understood.

36:58.149 --> 36:59.985
Good night, sir.
Good night.

36:59.985 --> 37:01.987
Oh, uh, how was
Tim's laparoscopic?

37:03.855 --> 37:07.326
Yeah. Um...

37:07.326 --> 37:09.895
He ended up needing
emergency spinal surgery.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.142
Are you okay?

37:24.142 --> 37:25.311
Uh, why didn't
anyone tell me?

37:25.311 --> 37:27.779
No, I'm-- I'm good.
I'm good.

37:27.779 --> 37:31.116
Doctor said I'm gonna
make a full recovery.

37:31.116 --> 37:34.286
And I told everyone
to keep you in the dark.

37:34.286 --> 37:35.654
Why?

37:35.654 --> 37:36.722
I didn't want
you to worry.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.493
So, just to be clear--

37:41.493 --> 37:42.694
You thought you might
be paralyzed,

37:42.694 --> 37:44.162
but you were
worried about <i>me?</i>

37:44.162 --> 37:45.464
You know what?
Slow your roll, Chen.

37:47.065 --> 37:50.001
Clearly, I misspoke.
I was worried about the station.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.704
And I knew you'd be
too concerned about me

37:52.704 --> 37:55.040
to take over for Smitty.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.142
Mm-hmm.

37:57.142 --> 37:59.311
I heard you saved the day, though.

37:59.311 --> 38:01.046
Being sergeant's
not so hard.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.948
I don't know why
you're always complaining.

38:02.948 --> 38:06.151
Really?
Just smooth sailing?

38:06.151 --> 38:08.554
No. It was awful.

38:08.554 --> 38:10.489
How do that many things
go wrong in one day?

38:10.489 --> 38:12.358
That wasn't even
a particularly bad day.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.328
Where's Ashley?

38:16.328 --> 38:18.797
Yeah, I-I, uh--
I sent her home.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.632
She was exhausted.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.434
Okay. Hm.

38:25.371 --> 38:27.072
What are you doing?

38:28.740 --> 38:31.209
I'm keeping you company.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.312
You don't have
to do that.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.481
I know.

38:39.451 --> 38:43.121
Okay, okay.

38:43.121 --> 38:44.289
- Oh, okay.
- Just open it.

38:44.289 --> 38:46.658
- Sure. Okay.
- He's fine. He's fine.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.961
Okay, so and then the door
opens, and Wesley walks in

38:49.961 --> 38:51.663
to represent me.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.198
All of us.

38:53.198 --> 38:54.400
I thought Angela's head
was going to explode.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.903
Good man, looking out for
your brothers-in-law.

38:57.903 --> 38:59.738
Whoa.
Good man?

38:59.738 --> 39:01.507
<i>Brave</i> man.

39:01.507 --> 39:03.141
No, no, no, no.
Not-- Not so brave.

39:03.141 --> 39:05.343
I knew that
she would understand.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.547
Angela believes
in tough love, sure.

39:08.547 --> 39:11.483
But no one is more protective
of the people she cares about.

39:11.483 --> 39:12.684
Oh.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.320
I have something to say.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.355
Mom, you don't have to.
Yes, I do.

39:17.355 --> 39:21.493
It's something I should have
said a long time ago to you.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.061
I know you always thought

39:23.061 --> 39:26.297
I didn't pay you
enough attention growing up,

39:26.297 --> 39:29.635
that all my focus
went to your brothers.

39:29.635 --> 39:33.038
I always denied it,
but you were right.

39:33.038 --> 39:36.341
It's not because
I didn't <i>love</i> you as much.

39:39.177 --> 39:42.848
You're my daughter,
my only daughter,

39:42.848 --> 39:47.152
and I love you in a way
that is only for you.

39:47.152 --> 39:48.620
♪ Yeah, I don't care now

39:48.620 --> 39:53.959
But you didn't need me
as much as much.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.528
Not the way they did.

39:56.528 --> 40:00.832
Since you could crawl,
you took care of yourself.

40:00.832 --> 40:03.969
And when you could walk,
you took care of your brothers,

40:03.969 --> 40:06.071
even though they were
older than you.

40:06.071 --> 40:10.942
And I relied on you.
I came to expect it.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.311
But as strong as you were,

40:13.311 --> 40:16.882
I should have realized that
you still needed your mother.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.984
♪ The world got cold

40:18.984 --> 40:24.122
I love you, mija.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.524
And I'm sorry.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.526
♪ I'm less afraid

40:27.526 --> 40:28.727
To Angela.

Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

40:29.895 --> 40:31.162

40:31.162 --> 40:32.397
Salud.

40:32.397 --> 40:34.966
Mom, I love you.

40:34.966 --> 40:36.535
♪ Go tumbling

40:36.535 --> 40:37.536
Thank you.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.237
♪ Let the ghost get loud

40:39.237 --> 40:41.439
Are you still worried
I went back too soon?

40:41.439 --> 40:45.310
No. Actually, you seemed
pretty amazing today.

40:46.344 --> 40:47.679
I guess the only
question left is,

40:47.679 --> 40:48.880
are you ever gonna
fill me in

40:48.880 --> 40:50.816
on the whole
"I was dead before" thing?

40:50.816 --> 40:52.450
Well,
there's not much to tell.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.452
You already know about
the second time--

40:54.452 --> 40:57.523
My oxygen regulator
malfunctioned on a halo jump.

40:57.523 --> 41:00.726
Luckily, the other guys noticed,
pulled my ripcord,

41:00.726 --> 41:04.295
and brought me back to life
on the ground.

41:04.295 --> 41:07.065
That is so badass.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.066
And the first time?

41:08.066 --> 41:10.401
Two words-- Big Foot.

41:10.401 --> 41:11.570
See, I don't even know
why I bother.

41:12.704 --> 41:13.872
'Cause you love me.
Fair enough.

41:17.509 --> 41:21.379
You know, the first two times
I was brought back to life,

41:21.379 --> 41:25.984
I was scared,
but only a little.

41:25.984 --> 41:28.887
And I moved on
pretty quickly.

41:28.887 --> 41:32.357
But this--
this last time,

41:32.357 --> 41:36.194
all I could think about
was losing you.

41:36.194 --> 41:39.330
I've never
been happier

41:39.330 --> 41:43.835
or felt
more seen or loved.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.572
And the thought
of losing a second

41:46.572 --> 41:50.108
of whatever time we have left
was heartbreaking.

41:51.910 --> 41:55.313
So here's my question.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.951
John Nolan...

41:59.951 --> 42:01.186
will you marry me?

42:01.186 --> 42:05.624
♪ As long as you're with me

42:05.624 --> 42:07.626
Try and stop me.

42:07.626 --> 42:09.527
♪ As long as you're with me

42:09.527 --> 42:11.863
♪ Not scared of no trouble
