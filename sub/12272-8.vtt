Ecklie's been
on me

00:09.600 --> 00:11.000
to finish
the monthly stats,

00:11.100 --> 00:13.300
so I need a list
of all the Lab call-outs

00:13.400 --> 00:14.800
Dtc as you can.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.300
llavy e end of shift tomorrow.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.600
Thanks.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.600
So, you've been pulling a
lot of doubles this week.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.700
Yeah, it's
about all I do.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.700
Have you been in
touch with Sara?

00:24.500 --> 00:25.700
We've talked a little.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.200
So where's she at?

00:27.400 --> 00:28.800
San Francisco.
Visiting her mother.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.000
No, I mean--
that's nice.

00:30.100 --> 00:31.800
No, but I meant where's
she at emotionally?

00:31.900 --> 00:33.600
You know, with respect
to the two of you.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.100
I can't speak for her.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.100
So speak for
yourself.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.100
I can't talk,
I'm really busy.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.800
So Archie's
in the Garage,

02:08.800 --> 02:11.000
he's documenting evidence
from a drug bust,

02:11.000 --> 02:12.500
he picks up a thing
of coke,

02:12.600 --> 02:14.800
and then it blows up
in his face?

02:14.900 --> 02:17.000
No. He picks up
a cellophane

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
and duct-tape-wrapped
kilo of coke,

02:19.000 --> 02:21.100
and the third one from
the top of the stack

02:21.200 --> 02:22.500
blows up in
his face.
Oh.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.800
It's important to be specific.

02:23.900 --> 02:24.800
Okay, well,

02:24.900 --> 02:27.000
this game is not as much fun
as I thought

02:27.000 --> 02:28.700
it was going
to be--
It's not a game,

02:28.700 --> 02:30.300
it's a thought experiment.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.300
If you want to be
a good criminalist--

02:31.300 --> 02:32.600
I am a good criminalist.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.800
If you want to be a better
criminalist,

02:34.800 --> 02:36.700
then you have to learn
to train to--
Learn

02:36.700 --> 02:38.800
to think like a criminal.
I know.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.500
Look, I'm sure Grissom's
told you...

02:41.500 --> 02:45.000
well, maybe not you,
but he's told me many times:

02:45.100 --> 02:47.100
that we speak for the dead.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.100
Think of this
exercise as a way

02:49.200 --> 02:51.800
for the dead to speak
for themselves.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.200
SIMMS:
<i>But that's not actually</i>
<i>what this is--</i>

02:54.200 --> 02:56.600
HODGES:
<i>It's a chance</i>
<i>for you to be a CSI.</i>

02:57.100 --> 03:00.500
<i>The only thing you need to do</i>
<i>is answer two simple questions.</i>

03:00.800 --> 03:03.200

HODGES:
<i>After HazMat cleans up</i>
<i>the scene...</i>

03:46.500 --> 03:48.100
<i>the coroner does his thing...</i>

03:48.300 --> 03:49.800
No sign of
sexual trauma.

03:50.000 --> 03:50.700
SIMMS:
<i>What?</i>

03:50.800 --> 03:52.700
HODGES:
<i>I believe he's legally</i>

03:52.900 --> 03:54.500
???

03:54.500 --> 03:56.200
I can't believe
Archie's gone.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.100
He was too good
for this world.

04:02.100 --> 04:02.900
What?

04:02.900 --> 04:04.700
They would be very upset.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.000
Can we at least stipulate

04:06.100 --> 04:08.600
that they heroically contain
their bereavement?

04:08.700 --> 04:11.000
Yes, I suppose Archie
could live with that.

04:11.100 --> 04:12.200
So to speak.

04:13.100 --> 04:13.700
Thank you.

04:13.700 --> 04:14.500
Mm-hmm.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.000
HODGES:
<i>What the CSIs realize is...</i>

04:18.399 --> 04:19.700
It's gotta be
the dealer.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.800
Yeah, he booby-trapped
the stash

04:21.800 --> 04:23.200
so if the cops got
the drugs...

04:23.300 --> 04:23.900
Then they would
get the boom

04:24.000 --> 04:25.400
along with it?
Right?

04:25.500 --> 04:26.900
Am I right?
G you're wrong.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.300
Just let me finish the setup,

04:28.400 --> 04:30.000
okay?
Sorry.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.800
HODGES:
<i>What the CSIs</i>
<i>finally realize is...</i>

04:32.800 --> 04:34.800
SIMMS:
<i>They sorted everything already?</i>
<i>That was quick.</i>

04:34.900 --> 04:36.800
HODGES:
<i>Can you just let me finish!</i>

04:39.100 --> 04:41.900
According to this,
20 bricks of coke were logged

04:42.000 --> 04:44.100
into evidence
just past midnight.

04:44.900 --> 04:47.700
The explosion occurred
about a half an hour later.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.600
But there are 21
wrappers here.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.800
And since no one entered

04:53.900 --> 04:56.300
or exited the Lab
during that time frame,

04:56.500 --> 04:58.000
it means the explosive
was planted

04:58.000 --> 04:59.800
in the suitcase here.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.200
Which means...

05:03.200 --> 05:05.300
The killer is someone
in the Lab.

05:06.300 --> 05:09.800
Well, if the killer is someone
who works in the Lab,

05:09.900 --> 05:12.000
then he could just tamper
with the evidence.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.800
Which means that there's
really no way for me

05:14.900 --> 05:16.800
to solve this thing,
this a trick question.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.700
No, no, no, that's
not what I want...

05:20.600 --> 05:22.000
My shoelace is untied.

05:22.300 --> 05:23.400
Excuse me.
Okay.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.100
Okay, um...

05:25.200 --> 05:26.200
wouldn't, how
about this.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.300
Since it would be
pretty risky

05:28.400 --> 05:29.100
for the killer

05:29.200 --> 05:31.200
to tamper with evidence
during a full-on

05:31.300 --> 05:32.400
investigation in the Lab...
Mm-hmm.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.900
let's just say,

05:33.900 --> 05:37.100
for the purposes
of this exercise,

05:37.100 --> 05:38.700
that can't happen.

05:38.700 --> 05:39.600
Okay.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.500
Now what?

05:41.600 --> 05:42.800
That's up to you.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.500
You have the setup.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.800
You run the investigation
from here.

05:45.900 --> 05:47.900
Simple Q & A.
You ask, I answer.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.000
Truthfully?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.600
Absolutely.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.000
No lying-- call that a rule.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.800
Well, what if I get close
to actually figuring it out,

05:54.800 --> 05:56.700
you're not just gonna change who
did it or something like that?

05:56.800 --> 05:59.100
No revisionism-- also a rule.

05:59.100 --> 06:00.100
For something
that's not a game

06:00.200 --> 06:02.100
it sure does have
a lot of rules.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.600
You want to do this or not?

06:03.700 --> 06:05.300
All right.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.100
Okay.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.700
I guess the first thing
that I would do

06:09.800 --> 06:12.500
would be to examine
the actual bomb mechanism

06:12.500 --> 06:14.700
to see if there's any clue
as to who might have built it.

06:14.700 --> 06:15.900
Good idea.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.900
Because there are a lot
of clues.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.400
Chemicals have been sent
to Trace for I.D.,

06:27.500 --> 06:31.300
but the bomb appears
to be a binary explosive.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.700
<i>Killer hides the loaded brick</i>
<i>amongst the others...</i>

06:36.700 --> 06:38.900
<i>A little pressure arms it...</i>

06:38.900 --> 06:42.400
<i>Liquid "A" in ampoule mixes</i>
<i> solid "B",</i>

06:42.500 --> 06:45.700
<i>creating an unstable</i>
<i>chemical explosive...</i>

06:45.700 --> 06:47.300
<i>all you need to do is move it.</i>

07:10.900 --> 07:12.400
Ooh, I have an idea.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.100
HODGES:
<i>What?</i>

07:13.100 --> 07:14.900
SIMMS:
<i>What about the blasting cap?</i>

07:15.500 --> 07:17.100
HODGES:
<i>Ah, well, what do you know?</i>

07:17.200 --> 07:19.200
<i>The leg wires are color coded.</i>

07:19.300 --> 07:20.300
SIMMS:
<i>Good, 'cause the color</i>

07:20.400 --> 07:22.300
coding is manufacturer
specific.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.700
So now we can track down
the source.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.300
Indeed we could.

07:25.700 --> 07:27.100
Hey, people.
What's going on?

07:27.200 --> 07:28.100
Nothing.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.900
You look... better.

07:33.700 --> 07:34.400
Let's say you learn

07:34.500 --> 07:37.400
that LVPD recently
seized one dozen

07:37.400 --> 07:38.700
commercial grade
blasting caps

07:38.900 --> 07:40.700
in an arson-explosives
raid,

07:40.800 --> 07:43.800
and that the Lab
was processing the
case evidence.

07:43.900 --> 07:45.900
Well, then, I know exactly
where I'd go next...

07:46.000 --> 07:48.200
'Course I know
where those blasting caps are.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.600
They're right in here.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.800
SIMMS:
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

07:50.900 --> 07:52.000
Not so fast, cowboy.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.800
Give me those keys.

08:15.300 --> 08:15.600
Looks like

08:15.700 --> 08:17.800
you're one blasting cap shy,
Bob.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.800
That's not possible.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.200
Wait...

08:23.300 --> 08:24.600
Y'all don't think
I had something

08:24.700 --> 08:25.800
to do with...

08:28.100 --> 08:29.500
Are there any prints
on the lock?

08:29.600 --> 08:31.000
Excuse me, we're--

08:31.200 --> 08:32.100
Playing a murder game.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.600
I know, I get it.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.500
I wanna play.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.600
He says
it's not a game.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.200
Well, I wanna play anyway.

08:38.299 --> 08:39.500
No.
Why not?

08:39.799 --> 08:40.799
You're the dead guy.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.600
Oh.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.100
Well, then I'd have
a vested interest

08:44.100 --> 08:45.600
in the outcome then,
wouldn't I?

08:45.900 --> 08:46.700
Oh, come on,
I'll fill him in

08:46.800 --> 08:47.600
as we go along.

08:50.100 --> 08:50.800
Fine.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.600
Yup. So.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.400
Are there any prints
on the lock?

08:54.400 --> 08:55.700
HODGES:
<i>No, no prints.</i>

08:55.900 --> 08:57.400
???

08:59.200 --> 09:00.800
Looks like this lock's
been slipped.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.400
So somebody stole thblolting
cap from Ballists

09:10.500 --> 09:12.100
to make it look
like Bobby did it.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.000
Nefarious, don't
you think?

09:14.100 --> 09:15.400
What about the chemicals
that were used

09:15.500 --> 09:16.700
to make the explosive?

09:17.400 --> 09:18.800
Did we get anything back
from Trace?

09:20.800 --> 09:22.700
T1
You always get something
from Trace.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.400
The explosive was
liquid nitro-acetate

09:25.400 --> 09:27.900
and solid ammonium nitrate
packed in baking soda.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.000
To blend in with the rest
of the cocaine bricks.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Cute.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.900
Explosive liquids are
generally pretty volatile.

09:34.000 --> 09:34.700
Did you ask Hodges

09:34.800 --> 09:37.400
if nitro-acetate has any special
storage requirements?

09:37.500 --> 09:38.800
HODGES:
<i>It needs to be refrigerated.</i>

09:38.900 --> 09:41.200
Yeah, he said it needed
to be refrigerated.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.000
NEll, there's only so many
refrigerators in the Lab.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.500
Maybe "where" can get us
to "who".

10:04.500 --> 10:05.700
I.
What are you guys
looking for?

10:05.900 --> 10:07.900
I'm sorry, we can't
tell you that, Henry.

10:08.200 --> 10:08.900
Nitrogen

10:09.000 --> 10:10.400
tetra-hydride...

10:13.400 --> 10:14.600
Sodium nitrate.

10:15.000 --> 10:15.400
Wait, what happens

10:15.500 --> 10:16.700
when you mix
those two compounds?

10:16.800 --> 10:18.500
They produce nitro-acetate.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.900
That's a high explosive binary,
Henry.

10:20.900 --> 10:21.600
Really?

10:21.700 --> 10:23.100
I didn't know that.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.200
Look, just 'cause I
have those compounds

10:26.200 --> 10:26.900
in my fridge
doesn't mean

10:27.000 --> 10:29.100
I used them to make
nitro-acetate.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.300
You can't
prove that.

10:31.300 --> 10:34.900
Baking soda was used to conceal
the explosive, smartass.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.000
It's also used to
absorb odors.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.300
Nice smell is a priority
of my life.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.200
I think the baking soda was used

10:41.300 --> 10:43.500
to absorb a lot more than odors,
Henr

11:10.800 --> 11:12.800
Okay, I confess,
I did it!

11:13.000 --> 11:14.100
Henry?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.500
Why would Henry kill me?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.300
We're not supposed to care
about the why.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.600
Whatever.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.000
Hey, fellas.
Hey.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.900
Thanks for giving me
justice at least.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.700
Yeah, you're welcome.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.900
Man, I don't know
if I'm more tired

11:32.000 --> 11:32.800
or hungry right now.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.400
You wanna get something
to eat?
Yeah.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.400
Actually, I felt like
a little Pai Gow

11:36.500 --> 11:37.300
or some Blackjack.

11:37.300 --> 11:38.700
Let's hit the Strip.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.100
After the shift
we just pulled?
Yeah.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.700
I just drank one of
those energy drinks.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.800
I probably w't sleep for
another couple hours.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
I don't think so,
man.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.400
Maybe another time,
huh?

11:47.700 --> 11:48.700
All right.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.300
I'll catch ya later.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.300
All right, Grissom G

11:55.400 --> 11:56.900
That's it for me.
I'm out of here.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.500
Yeah, I'm going over to Frank's

12:02.600 --> 12:03.500
to grab something to eat.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.000
I'll probably be there
for at least an hour

12:05.100 --> 12:07.100
if you want to...
if you want to join me.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.500
You know, we don't have to talk
about anything in particular.

12:13.700 --> 12:14.800
Just two guys
having breakfast.

12:15.700 --> 12:16.900
I just don't think
it's good for people

12:16.900 --> 12:18.300
to be alone too much.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.700
If you want to, cool.
If not, cool.

12:22.800 --> 12:23.800
Whatever.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.800
Hi.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.600
Rack 'em up.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.700
Excuse me?

12:37.800 --> 12:40.300
Well, word on campus is,
there's a murder game going on.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.800
Oh, no, no, no,
it's not a game.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.000
It's a thought experiment.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.800
Sounds like the late
Archie Johnson

12:45.800 --> 12:47.000
has a big mouth.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.700
Come on, please, it's been
really slow at Prints all day.

12:49.700 --> 12:50.700
Who we killin'?

12:53.700 --> 12:57.400
Henry, I need the tox
on that lady, um...

13:00.100 --> 13:01.800
Henry!

13:08.000 --> 13:09.700
No sign of
sexual trauma.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.200
Thank God for small favors.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.700
You know, David,
our job is never easy,

13:14.800 --> 13:16.800
but this is a colleague.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.800
If your emotions are too raw

13:18.900 --> 13:21.000
and you feel you need
to excuse yourself...

13:21.500 --> 13:22.800
Look.
(crunching)

13:22.900 --> 13:23.600
He's crunchy.

13:23.700 --> 13:24.700
Um...
(crunching)

13:34.200 --> 13:36.300
Frozen sweat stains. Yuck.

13:36.900 --> 13:40.500
He was trapped in a small space
at minus ten degrees centigrade.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.800
So it's fair to assume
he was exerting himself

13:43.900 --> 13:46.400
in a state
of mind-numbing terror.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.800
How long do you think
he was stuck in there?

13:50.800 --> 13:52.600
Well, several hours at least.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.500
Time of exposure
in extreme cold

13:54.500 --> 13:57.100
is difficult to gauge
physiologically.

13:57.100 --> 14:00.800
Why don't you let me know
when he softens up

14:00.800 --> 14:02.500
and we'll start cutting.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.600
So we're just going to
wait for him to thaw?

14:05.800 --> 14:08.200
What do you want me to do,
stick him in a microwave?

14:13.700 --> 14:14.800
Ooh...

14:14.900 --> 14:17.500
Hot... hot, hot, hot.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.500
So, then, okay,
Henry froze to death.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.200
Well, maybe not.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.600
Because if the autopsy
hasn't been performed yet,

14:24.700 --> 14:26.500
then we can't be sure
that's COD.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.500
Well played, Simms.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.500
So it takes a few turns

14:29.600 --> 14:31.600
for the autopsy results
to get back.
Turns?

14:32.100 --> 14:33.700
Hours. A few hours.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.900
So, while you're waiting
for the autopsy results,

14:36.000 --> 14:37.500
what do you do
in the meantime?

14:37.600 --> 14:40.100
Well, the CSIs would
process the freezer.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.200
Did they find anything?

14:41.200 --> 14:42.800
A virtual cornucopia.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.500
WILLOWS:
The condition of the interior
could be the result

14:57.600 --> 14:59.000
of a struggle,

14:59.800 --> 15:02.800
or the simple,
understandable panic

15:02.900 --> 15:04.800
of a man trapped
inside a freezer.

15:05.800 --> 15:08.300
In any event,
the emergency release handle

15:08.400 --> 15:11.200
appears to have been bent
and rendered inoperative,

15:11.300 --> 15:15.100
and several chemical containers
broken in the process

15:15.400 --> 15:17.100
possibly releasing chloroform

15:17.200 --> 15:20.000
and methyl ethyl ketone
into the space.

15:20.400 --> 15:23.100
I'm sending samples to Trace
to confirm.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.500
(laughs):
Trace.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.500
Is there anything you can't do?

15:29.600 --> 15:30.600
Hodges.

15:30.700 --> 15:31.900
Sorry.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.600
This could be a case
of lab geek humor gone wrong.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.600
Hello!

16:06.000 --> 16:07.500
Hello?! It's not funny!

16:18.600 --> 16:19.500
Oh, my God.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.200
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, help!

16:25.500 --> 16:26.700
Help me!

16:27.500 --> 16:28.700
(muffled):
Please help!

16:29.900 --> 16:31.700
So the merry prankster
comes back later,

16:31.800 --> 16:33.200
sees the joke gone bad,

16:33.200 --> 16:35.300
then he just yanks the pin
and scrams.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.600
You said that the emergency
release plunger was bent.

16:39.100 --> 16:39.500
Mm-hmm.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.200
Well, that thing is made
of solid steel.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.200
How could Henry do that?

16:43.300 --> 16:44.000
Adrenaline kicks in

16:44.100 --> 16:46.400
when he finally realizes
that he's dying.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.800
So, maybe in the moment
of crisis,

16:48.900 --> 16:50.400
Henry has the strength
of ten men.

16:51.700 --> 16:53.200
Ten small men.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.200
"Maybe."

16:55.300 --> 16:57.600
That word always looks
so good on a case report.

16:58.500 --> 16:59.400
Was there any evidence
on the handle

16:59.500 --> 17:00.900
on the outside of the freezer?

17:01.200 --> 17:02.600
Just a schmear.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.599
<i>Sugar, soy protein,</i>

17:06.599 --> 17:09.300
<i>partially hydrogenated</i>
<i>vegetable oils,</i>

17:09.300 --> 17:10.599
<i>roasted nuts.</i>

17:11.200 --> 17:11.700
Peanut butter?

17:11.800 --> 17:13.800
WEBSTER:
Well, killer's got to eat, too.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.300
SIMMS:
So, CSIs would check
every trash can

17:16.400 --> 17:18.900
and every bio hazard disposal
unit in the whole Lab.

17:18.900 --> 17:21.500
HODGES:
Yes, the would,
and they would find...

17:26.300 --> 17:27.800
What, no jelly?

17:27.900 --> 17:30.000
We found the peanut butter
from inside your glove.

17:30.100 --> 17:33.000
It matches the stuff we found
on the freezer door handle.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.800
Chunky, right?

17:34.800 --> 17:36.200
I didn't kill Henry.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.700
Well, not on purpose.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.300
No, not even by accident.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.300
I only had a couple of minutes
for lunch,

17:43.400 --> 17:45.000
and I had a bu

17:45.100 --> 17:46.300
that needed to be stored.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.200
And I store them in the freezer.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.100
You seem very tense.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.800
You know, I don't really like
being persecuted.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.700
Yeah.

17:58.900 --> 18:00.400
Get used to it, punk.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.400
No, I don't know about that.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.600
What?
Well, Bobby's a gun guy.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.000
Gun guys shoot people.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.400
Gun guys don't shoot people.

18:07.500 --> 18:08.800
People shoot people.

18:08.900 --> 18:11.500
Actually, bullets shoot people,
shot from guns

18:11.600 --> 18:13.300
which are usually in the hands
of gun guys.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.000
Can we get the autopsy results?

18:15.100 --> 18:17.300
Well, I guess Henry's had
enough time to defrost.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.200
COD was not, in fact,
due to hypothermia.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.300
Ooh, wait, no, I can guess
what they found in Tox.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.400
It was chloroform.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.000
Nope.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.200
Methyl ethyl ether?

18:25.300 --> 18:26.100
PCP.

18:26.200 --> 18:26.900
What?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.400
Massive, overdose amounts
of PCP.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.300
Commonly known as phencyclidine,
or angel dust.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
<i>PCP blocks the brain's</i>
<i>NMDA receptors,</i>

18:37.100 --> 18:40.400
<i>hypothalamus goes nuts,</i>
<i>resulting in anxiety,</i>

18:40.500 --> 18:42.500
<i>confusion,</i>
<i>and fever-like overheating.</i>

18:46.200 --> 18:49.400
WEBSTER:
<i>So Henry goes into the cooler</i>
<i>to cool off...</i>

18:50.000 --> 18:52.500
SIMMS:
<i>And with the PCP stimulating</i>
<i>his adrenal glands,</i>

18:52.600 --> 18:54.500
<i>he has the strength</i>
<i>of the Incredible Hulk.</i>

18:59.100 --> 19:00.300
ANDREWS:
<i>A duster?</i>

19:00.300 --> 19:01.500
You made me a lousy duster?

19:01.500 --> 19:03.000
That is totally bogus.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.400
Aside  om the 10,000

19:05.500 --> 19:06.700
other reasons
why I'd be crazy

19:06.800 --> 19:10.400
to even try that junk,
if I were a closet PCP freak,

19:10.500 --> 19:12.000
I wouldn't do it in the Lab.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.300
That's very professional.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.900
Archie told me
about your sick

19:15.000 --> 19:16.700
little thought experimenxp
and I want to play.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.600
But I still can't believe,
even hypothetically,

19:18.700 --> 19:19.800
you'd do something
like this to me.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.000
Well, Henry, I hypothetically
called your mother

19:22.000 --> 19:23.500
and I explained everything.

19:23.900 --> 19:25.800
That woman is a crier.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.300
Your autopsy didn't mention

19:27.400 --> 19:28.900
powder in
his nasal passages

19:29.000 --> 19:30.700
or PCP damage in his lungs.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.300
That's because it wasn't there.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.900
So Henry didn't inhale it,
or smoke it, or snort it?

19:35.400 --> 19:36.700
No, he didn't.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.400
Then how did the PCP
get into my system?

19:39.500 --> 19:41.400
You tell me.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.300
Oh!

19:45.300 --> 19:46.500
Crusty pits.

19:46.900 --> 19:48.100
Sweat stains.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.200
You said that Henry's lab coat
had big sweat stains

19:50.300 --> 19:51.600
on the collar
and on the armpits.

19:51.700 --> 19:54.700
So that's it--
somebody dosed the coat.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.200
<i>Lab coat tests positive</i>
<i>for PCP.</i>

20:13.200 --> 20:15.600
Combined with body heat
and sweat,

20:15.600 --> 20:18.200
the dr must'

20:18.200 --> 20:20.900
Like a nicotine patch from hell.

20:21.800 --> 20:25.500
Well, Henry would've died
of an overdose no matter what.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.400
So, all the trapping him
in the freezer

20:28.500 --> 20:30.100
with the
chemicals spilling,

20:30.300 --> 20:32.100
that was all
completely incidental.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.700
It was the logical outcome
of the initial crime.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.000
And it's quite funny.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.300
Hey.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.600
Well, we're not done yet.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.500
Who did the deed?

20:41.900 --> 20:43.000
Well, taking lab coats

20:43.100 --> 20:45.000
off the premises
is against regulations.

20:45.100 --> 20:48.000
So the PCP would've had to have
been applied in the Lab,

20:48.100 --> 20:49.200
right under our noses.

20:49.300 --> 20:50.100
And that stuff reeks.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.600
I have to crank
my fume hood up full

20:51.700 --> 20:53.300
whenever I work with it,
I still go home with a headache.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.800
Fume hoods. There's fume hoods
in the Garage,

20:55.900 --> 20:57.300
<i>and DNA and Trace.</i>

20:57.400 --> 20:59.400
<i>So we would have to test</i>
<i>all the sinks for PCP.</i>

20:59.500 --> 21:00.400
HODGES:
<i>Excellent.</i>

21:01.500 --> 21:03.100
<i>That's a good approach.</i>

21:04.200 --> 21:07.400
???

21:13.200 --> 21:14.300
HODGES:
<i>But you would find nothing.</i>

21:14.300 --> 21:15.200
SIMMS:
<i>Really?</i>

21:15.200 --> 21:18.300
<i>Yeah, there's no trace of PCP</i>
<i>in any of sinks.</i>

21:18.300 --> 21:19.400
<i>Squeaky clean.</i>

21:20.600 --> 21:21.500
Damn it.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.400
Oh! Wait.

21:36.700 --> 21:39.300
I got it, check the plant.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.000
HODGES:
<i>You got it.</i>

21:44.500 --> 21:47.800
<i>The killer cleaned up,</i>
<i>but he left one witness.</i>

21:57.400 --> 21:58.500
Wendy.

21:58.500 --> 21:59.100
Me?

21:59.200 --> 22:01.300
Oh, drat.

22:02.100 --> 22:03.700
Well, it's not a slow day
for me after all.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.300
Ecklie wants me to pick up
the backlog from Swing.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.200
Somebody please tell me
who dies next.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.900
And how.
Thank you.

22:10.000 --> 22:10.500
So...

22:12.000 --> 22:12.800
You got time for one more?

22:12.900 --> 22:14.500
Well, someone's having fun.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.800
Maybe a little.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.400
You're not bad at this.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.000
SIMMS:
Thanks.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.300
I've been thinking about taking
the CSI field test.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.700
This is actually really good
theory and practice for me.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.200
The fi

22:25.200 --> 22:26.100
Yeah.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.000
What?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Why?

22:29.000 --> 22:29.700
Nothing.

22:29.700 --> 22:30.500
Nothing?

22:30.600 --> 22:31.900
That's right.

22:31.900 --> 22:32.900
A great big pile of nothing.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.300
From me, to you.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.200
Oh, hey.

22:38.700 --> 22:39.700
How are you?

22:39.800 --> 22:40.900
Why?

22:41.500 --> 22:42.400
I can't ask how
you're doing?

22:43.300 --> 22:44.200
I'm sorry.

22:44.300 --> 22:45.900
I've just had
a lot of, uh...

22:46.400 --> 22:47.100
I've been busy.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.500
Oh.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.500
Well, maybe you should
take a few days off,

22:52.000 --> 22:52.900
for once in your career.

22:52.900 --> 22:54.400
I mean, you've got
enough stored up.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.100
Go after her.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.100
It's not what she wants.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.200
What do you want?

23:01.800 --> 23:03.300
I want her to be happy.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.800
Field Agent Simms.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.000
Stop it.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.800
Hey, I think it's got
a nice ring to it.
Thank you.

23:09.900 --> 23:12.400
Here she comes,
flashing her badge,

23:12.800 --> 23:14.100
taking down perps.

23:14.100 --> 23:15.500
Why is even potential
advancement

23:15.600 --> 23:16.400
so threatening to you?

23:16.500 --> 23:19.000
Hey, S ders left the lab,
he got his ass kicked.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.700
I'm just saying.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.100
All right, come on,
let's do another one.

23:23.300 --> 23:24.900
Okay. Fine.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.600
Let's.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.600
SIMMS:
<i>Well, now, that's a little</i>
<i>passive-aggressive,</i>

24:06.900 --> 24:08.000
No kidding.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.000
It appears as though

24:20.000 --> 24:21.700
the vic struck the edge
of the table.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
The evidence
on the floor is...

24:32.600 --> 24:33.800
well, evidence.

24:34.700 --> 24:37.300
Brown paper bindle
must have opened when it fell.

24:37.900 --> 24:40.200
Looks like the contents
of a woman's purse.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
???

24:43.500 --> 24:46.500
SIMMS:
Square toe, low heel,
stylish but affordable.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.100
Flirty, not whory.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.500
You will be missed.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.000
There's an oily residue
on the sole.

25:06.800 --> 25:10.200
SANDERS:
<i>The evidence appears to lead</i>
<i>to an inescapable conclusion.</i>

25:10.300 --> 25:12.900
<i>This tragedy might have just</i>
<i>simply been the result</i>

25:12.900 --> 25:15.700
<i>of an accident</i>
<i>in the workplace.</i>

25:16.000 --> 25:17.800
SIMMS:
<i>I fell off a ladder?</i>

25:18.200 --> 25:19.100
Well, you are kind
of little clumsy.

25:19.100 --> 25:19.900
Since when?

25:20.300 --> 25:21.800
It's endearing.

25:22.700 --> 25:23.200
HODGES:
Are you satisfied

25:23.300 --> 25:24.400
with the explanation?

25:24.500 --> 25:25.500
SIMMS:
Uh, no.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.600
What about the oily residue
on the ladder?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.400
<i>There are bristles in the oil,</i>

25:30.500 --> 25:32.700
<i>which means</i>
<i>that somebody brushed it on.</i>

25:33.500 --> 25:35.300
ANDREWS:
<i>What exactly is the oily stuff?</i>

25:35.400 --> 25:36.700
Well, thank God...

25:36.700 --> 25:38.400
...for trace analysis.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.000
Hmm.

25:40.200 --> 25:44.400
Hodges, who is a genius
and tragically underpaid,

25:45.200 --> 25:47.200
used the powers
of his brilliant mind

25:47.200 --> 25:48.600
and the scientific method

25:48.700 --> 25:50.500
to discover that the oil
that was brushed

25:50.600 --> 25:54.700
on the ladder was a Teflon-based
two-part oil.

25:56.100 --> 25:57.800
A gun lubricant.

25:58.700 --> 25:59.800
So?

26:00.300 --> 26:02.100
So you're the gun guy, Bobby.

26:02.300 --> 26:03.500
Yeah, which is exactly why

26:03.500 --> 26:06.600
I would never use
Teflon-based two-part oil.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.800
Real gun guys hate that stuff.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.600
If it separates in the can,
it separates in the gun.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:14.400 --> 26:15.800
Whoa. You are tense.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.400
So, where do you think
you're going?

26:17.400 --> 26:18.100
Back to work.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.600
This is ridiculous.
Oh.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.400
Sit down.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.400
No, no. Captain Brass
is not the kind of cop

26:27.500 --> 26:28.800
who smacks a suspect around.

26:28.900 --> 26:30.800
Really? Scares me.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.200
Oh, well, look
who's the clumsy one now.

26:36.200 --> 26:37.600
Excuse me.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.600
Okay, so we don't have nearly
enough to hold Bobby, right?

26:41.900 --> 26:43.400
No.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.400
All right.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.200
Who's up for an autopsy?

26:50.100 --> 26:53.600
ROBBINS:
The carotid-jugular complex
was transected,

26:53.600 --> 26:55.900
and based on the placement
and size of the wound,

26:56.500 --> 26:57.900
I'd say she had at...

26:58.000 --> 27:00.500
Hey, it's a neck wound.

27:03.900 --> 27:04.900
Based on the placement

27:05.000 --> 27:06.600
and size of
the neck wound,

27:06.800 --> 27:09.000
she was conscious 30
to 60 seconds

27:09.000 --> 27:10.500
before blood loss was fatal.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.000
That's a long time.

27:12.100 --> 27:14.600
No one reported her screaming
or calling out for help.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.200
We have to get back
to the case file.

27:21.700 --> 27:24.500
There was no blood
on her hands at the scene.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.400
Unless she was unconscious,

27:26.500 --> 27:28.800
she would have at least tried
to stop the bleeding.

27:28.900 --> 27:30.100
Well, there was no blow
to the head.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.100
Do you think it's possible

27:31.200 --> 27:32.800
she was dead
before she hit the table?

27:32.900 --> 27:34.800
You mean like
a cardiac event?

27:35.600 --> 27:37.000
I can't rule that out,

27:37.100 --> 27:39.600
but a healthy, 36-year-old
having a heart attack?

27:39.700 --> 27:41.900
SIMMS:
35 in October,
thank you very much.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.100
She has a oval, perimortem burn
on her wrist.

27:50.600 --> 27:51.900
Wait a second.
That's familiar.

28:08.700 --> 28:09.400
Singed right off

28:09.500 --> 28:11.900
her barely
35-year-old wrist.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.800
That bracelet wasn't
old evidence.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.300
I was wearing it.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.600
Correct.

28:17.100 --> 28:18.400
So, what
melts silver

28:18.500 --> 28:20.700
and stops your heart
at the same time?

28:21.400 --> 28:22.500
A bolt of lightning.

28:22.600 --> 28:23.500
In the lab

28:23.500 --> 28:24.700
Electrocution.

28:24.700 --> 28:25.400
From what?

28:25.500 --> 28:27.200
Something
in the Evidence Locker.

28:57.200 --> 29:00.100
SIMMS:
<i>There was a motorcycle battery</i>
<i>in the ventilation duct?</i>

29:01.000 --> 29:04.100
ANDREWS:
<i>Wired to the ladder</i>
<i>and the evidence box?</i>

29:05.100 --> 29:06.600
HODGES:
<i>Precisely.</i>

29:14.600 --> 29:16.500
Devilishly clever,
wouldn't you say?

29:17.100 --> 29:17.800
No.

29:17.900 --> 29:19.800
Well, who's the killer,
Wile E. Coyote?

29:19.800 --> 29:21.500
What do you mean?
ANDREWS:
It's ridiculous!

29:21.600 --> 29:23.000
Anyone could have walked
in there.

29:23.100 --> 29:24.500
So, what, the
victim's just random?

29:24.500 --> 29:26.600
Uh, no.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.400
How'd the killer get me up there
in the first place?

29:28.400 --> 29:29.800
What did he do, pass
me in the hall and say,

29:29.900 --> 29:31.000
"Hey, Wendy, go
climb up that ladder

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
"and check out the case evidence

29:32.100 --> 29:34.200
you had absolutely nothing
to do with?"

29:34.300 --> 29:37.200
Not in those words exactly,
but, uh, yeah.

29:37.300 --> 29:38.900
That's completely
unverifiable.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.500
This is so lame.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.400
Scenario requires
further revision.

29:42.500 --> 29:43.300
Okay, what is that?

29:43.400 --> 29:44.500
Nothing.

29:49.300 --> 29:50.200
Is that a tape recorder?

29:50.300 --> 29:52.500
You are so paranoid.

29:53.200 --> 29:54.600
This thought experiment

29:54.700 --> 29:57.600
has now concluded.
Thank you.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.900
Why were you
recording us?

30:04.900 --> 30:06.300
???

30:07.900 --> 30:09.900
Why would I record you?
That makes no sense.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.300
"Lab Rats."

30:20.900 --> 30:22.700
"The Game of Science
and Murder."

30:22.800 --> 30:24.000
It's a prototype.

30:24.100 --> 30:25.100
"Two to four players,

30:25.100 --> 30:26.500
ages eight and up."

30:27.500 --> 30:29.200
You're making a board game?

30:29.300 --> 30:31.600
Well, it's not just
a board game.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.800
Gets people to think.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.500
Why were you
recording us?

30:37.100 --> 30:39.400
I needed your help
to flesh out scenarios,

30:39.500 --> 30:41.600
and I figured that
if I hid the recorder,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.400
your answers would be candid
and honest.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.500
Look, see.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.200
It's like Clue,

30:51.900 --> 30:55.200
only CSI-ier.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.200
Hodges, this is, uh...

30:59.500 --> 31:01.200
This is kind of impressive.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.700
In a painfully sad,

31:05.400 --> 31:07.100
geek type of way.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.700
Well, painfully sad geeks

31:09.800 --> 31:11.900
have a lot of spare time
on their hands

31:12.700 --> 31:15.300
???

31:15.600 --> 31:17.000
Lab Rats could be a gold mine.

31:20.600 --> 31:21.900
Oh!

31:22.700 --> 31:24.100
(laughs):
Little Lab Techs.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.900
Mm-hmm.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.700
"Sandy Baxter,
fingerprint fanatic."

31:32.600 --> 31:34.200
"Reggie Chang,

31:34.300 --> 31:36.600
eagled-eyed A/V expert."

31:37.800 --> 31:41.500
"Andrew Henries,
top-notch tox tech."

31:42.700 --> 31:43.900
"Hodgkins."

31:45.000 --> 31:46.200
Hodgkins.

31:46.200 --> 31:46.600
Mm-hmm.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.700
You named yourself
after cancer.

31:51.900 --> 31:53.200
Oh!

31:55.700 --> 31:57.500
"Mindy Bimms,

31:58.300 --> 32:00.000
"the clumsy

32:00.000 --> 32:02.100
yet buxom DNA tech."

32:08.500 --> 32:09.500
Clumsy yet buxom?

32:11.400 --> 32:13.100
It's a redeeming feature.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.200
It's-It's a prototype.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.000
So, tell me, do you think

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
that Mindy Bimms is clumsy
because she's top-heavy?

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Or do you just mean clumsy

32:26.000 --> 32:26.900
like this?

32:34.500 --> 32:36.700
Okay, are you...
are you allergic

32:36.800 --> 32:37.600
to being honest with me?

32:37.700 --> 32:39.800
'Cause the thing is,
if you had actually asked me

32:39.900 --> 32:40.900
to help you with this game,

32:40.900 --> 32:41.700
I would have.

32:41.800 --> 32:44.200
But, no, you had to hide
a tape recorder under a table

32:44.300 --> 32:46.800
and engage us all
in this great big

32:46.900 --> 32:48.100
thought experiment!

32:48.300 --> 32:49.900
When in reality, it doesn'
even matter, apparently,

32:50.000 --> 32:53.300
what I think because
I'm just Mindy Big Boobs

32:53.300 --> 32:54.100
to you, and I...

32:55.700 --> 32:57.600
You are the dumbest
smart guy I know.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.000
You think I'm smart?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Night, Greg.

33:12.100 --> 33:13.500
Yeah, whatever.

33:15.700 --> 33:18.200
HODGES (high-pitched voice):
Oh, Hodges, I'm so sorry.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.400
It's just that I'm jealous
of your intellect.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.700
But Wendy, you have so much
to live for.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.000
Don't do it.
You're too close to the edge.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.600
Oh, and now I'm drowning!
Oh, God!

33:27.600 --> 33:29.900
Oh, God, help me.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.500
Help me.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.200
What are you doing?

33:34.200 --> 33:35.300
Oh, uh...

33:37.400 --> 33:39.200
I was, uh, just trying

33:39.300 --> 33:42.900
to... develop a board game

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
based on this place,

33:45.100 --> 33:48.200
but not in any
legally actionable sense.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.400
You get evidence,

33:51.500 --> 33:53.500
scenarios, analysis.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.200
Try to solve diabolical murders.

34:10.300 --> 34:11.199
I like games.

34:11.199 --> 34:12.199
Really?

34:12.900 --> 34:14.100
Yeah.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.900
Okay. Let's play.

34:22.900 --> 34:24.699
What makes it hard
to catch a killer?

34:25.400 --> 34:26.800
Is it the sheer
destructive power

34:26.900 --> 34:27.699
<i>of the murder itself</i>

34:27.800 --> 34:30.300
<i>that obliterates evidence</i>
<i>as it snuffs out life?</i>

34:38.800 --> 34:41.100
<i>Or is it the chain of events</i>
<i>the murder sets into motion</i>

34:41.199 --> 34:43.000
<i>which obscure the true crime?</i>

34:49.699 --> 34:51.199
That was good.

34:52.909 --> 34:53.498
<i>Or is it a mechanism</i>

34:53.500 --> 34:57.500
<i>so complexand diabolical</i>
<i>that it</i>

34:57.600 --> 34:59.300
<i>borders on the incredible?</i>

35:00.000 --> 35:02.400
In truth,
it is all these things,

35:02.700 --> 35:05.000
and all these things
are the same.

35:06.500 --> 35:09.100
Because the only real way
to catch a killer,

35:09.500 --> 35:10.900
is to outsmart him.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.400
And hope that he's
not smarter than you.

35:27.900 --> 35:31.700
???
in front of your computer,

35:31.800 --> 35:33.400
and you take a
bullet to the head.

35:33.700 --> 35:34.700
No witnesses.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.400
Nobody heard the shot,
and the killer

35:36.400 --> 35:38.000
is somebody in the Lab.

35:38.300 --> 35:39.600
Am I eligible?

35:39.600 --> 35:40.900
In this scenario, no.

35:42.300 --> 35:43.400
Okay.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.800
So during the basic
process of the scene,

35:45.800 --> 35:46.700
what do I find?

35:49.000 --> 35:50.600
HODGES:
<i>A single nine millimeter casing</i>

35:50.700 --> 35:52.100
<i>at the doorway to Trace.</i>

35:56.800 --> 36:00.500
Then my first blush theory
is a walk-by.

36:09.600 --> 36:10.800
I'm going to need the bullet.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.500
Then I'm going
to need an autopsy.

36:20.500 --> 36:23.900
Get it out of your system.
No sign of sexual trauma.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Out! Now

36:34.800 --> 36:36.500
All right,
trajectory of the shot

36:36.500 --> 36:39.300
was roughly 90 degrees
from vertical,

36:39.400 --> 36:42.300
straight through
his noble skull.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.600
Bullet didn't exit.

36:44.700 --> 36:46.200
GRISSOM:
<i>Is it intact?</i>

36:49.800 --> 36:51.300
More or less.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.000
IBIS.

36:53.900 --> 36:54.600
HODGES:
<i>The bullet's nose</i>

36:54.600 --> 36:57.400
<i>is significantly deformed</i>
<i>and the lead base is pitted.</i>

36:58.200 --> 37:00.100
<i>But there are sufficient striae</i>
<i>to get a match</i>

37:00.200 --> 37:02.000
<i>for what little it's worth.</i>

37:33.400 --> 37:34.500
<i>The gun came through the lab</i>

37:34.600 --> 37:36.800
<i>about a week ago</i>
<i>in a buyback program,</i>

37:36.800 --> 37:38.700
<i>and was subsequently destroyed.</i>

37:40.200 --> 37:43.400
So you were shot by a weapon
that no longer exists.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.000
Apparently.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.700
Okay, let's go over
your snuff film, shall we?

37:49.800 --> 37:51.800
I want to see
exactly what you did.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.600
In truth,
it is all of these things,

37:57.900 --> 38:00.000
and all of these things
are the same.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.800
Because the only real way
to catch a killer,

38:04.100 --> 38:08.300
is to outsmart him and hope
that he is not smarter than you.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.300
Do it again.
Do it again.

38:16.499 --> 38:16.399
One more time.
One more time.

38:16.400 --> 38:19.200
Wait, wait, wait--
they all want to watch?

38:20.300 --> 38:21.800
Professional curiosity.

38:22.000 --> 38:22.800
I guess.

38:24.500 --> 38:27.000
(on monitor):
In truth, it is
all these things,

38:27.300 --> 38:29.500
and all these things
are the same.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.200
Because the only real way
to catch a killer,

38:32.300 --> 38:36.500
is to outsmart him and hope
that he is not smarter than you.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.200
GRISSOM:
<i>You took the shot straight</i>
<i>into your head,</i>

38:51.600 --> 38:53.000
<i>but according to the video,</i>

38:53.100 --> 38:54.800
<i>you were not facing</i>
<i>the hallway.</i>

38:55.500 --> 38:57.500
Which means the bullet
didn't come from there.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.300
It must've come from here.

39:03.100 --> 39:04.700
HODGES:
<i>Yes, it did.</i>

39:12.700 --> 39:14.000
A zip gun.

39:14.100 --> 39:15.800
HODGES:
<i>With an unrifled barrel.</i>

39:17.000 --> 39:18.400
And a remote trigger.

39:19.300 --> 39:21.100
What model year is the pager?ag

39:21.200 --> 39:22.800
<i>Pre 1990.</i>

39:23.300 --> 39:25.300
So no call-back numbers.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.800
Pre-1990 pagers
didn't store them.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.400
HODGES:
<i>So, you're at a dead end?</i>

39:31.700 --> 39:33.000
I'm just getting started.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.100
Do I have to walk over
to the GCMS

39:48.200 --> 39:49.800
or will you just tell me?

39:50.000 --> 39:51.900
<i>The barrel of the zip gun</i>
<i>contains traces</i>

39:51.900 --> 39:53.100
<i>of black powder.</i>

39:55.600 --> 39:59.800
Okay, but the bullet
was pitted on the base,

40:00.500 --> 40:03.500
which is the result of exposure
to smokeless gunpowder.

40:04.300 --> 40:06.400
Which means that the bullet
that killed you

40:07.000 --> 40:08.500
was fired twice.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.600
GRISSOM:
<i>The killer test fires the gun,</i>

40:12.700 --> 40:14.500
<i>knowing it will be destroyed,VK</i>

40:14.600 --> 40:16.300
<i>and keeps the bullet</i>
<i>and the casing.</i>

40:18.100 --> 40:19.800
<i>He puts the bullet</i>
<i>in a metal tube</i>

40:19.900 --> 40:21.500
<i>on a wad of black powder.</i>

40:22.200 --> 40:24.000
<i>With a pager trigger,</i>
<i>it's essentially</i>

40:24.000 --> 40:25.300
<i>a remote controlled musket.</i>

40:25.500 --> 40:26.700
<i>Call the number from any phone</i>

40:26.700 --> 40:28.600
<i>or through the internet and...</i>

40:32.200 --> 40:33.600
Impressive.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.400
Can you tell me whodunit?

40:36.200 --> 40:38.200
Well, Bobby Dawson
is an early

40:38.300 --> 40:40.600
19th century
firearm enthusiast.

40:41.300 --> 40:44.100
???

40:44.600 --> 40:45.500
Oh, yeah.

40:45.800 --> 40:46.700
Big gun guy.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.700
I didn't do it!

40:49.800 --> 40:51.100
???

40:51.100 --> 40:52.800
I swear!

40:53.900 --> 40:54.800
Hey!

40:59.700 --> 41:00.900
Gun.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.900
What do you got
against Bobby Dawson?

41:13.300 --> 41:14.400
Nothing.

41:14.500 --> 41:15.700
Running gag.

41:16.200 --> 41:19.200
So, you think Bobby Dawson
did it?

41:20.600 --> 41:21.500
No.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.100
Bobby was framed.

41:24.600 --> 41:25.900
You drew me a map.

41:27.100 --> 41:28.100
The path
of the bullet,

41:28.200 --> 41:30.700
if not stopped
by your brain mass,

41:31.500 --> 41:32.600
would have continued straight

41:32.800 --> 41:34.100
through into
ballistics.

41:34.500 --> 41:36.100
Where Bobby works.

41:36.500 --> 41:37.800
Now, Bobby's a real gun guy,

41:37.900 --> 41:40.300
and no gun guy would ever
position himself

41:40.300 --> 41:42.100
down-range
of a shot.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.800
You're more than a victim,
Hodges.

41:48.200 --> 41:49.300
<i>According to your video,</i>

41:49.300 --> 41:51.900
<i>you straightened up just before</i>
<i>the fatal shot was fired.</i>

41:52.000 --> 41:53.600
<i>You knew it was coming.</i>

41:53.900 --> 41:55.900
<i>And you made sure that you were</i>
<i>in the perfect position</i>

41:56.000 --> 41:57.400
to catch it.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.200
I am a mere Padawan

41:59.300 --> 42:01.700
in the presence
of the Jedi Master.

42:02.900 --> 42:04.300
True.

42:06.700 --> 42:08.100
Let's play another.

42:08.300 --> 42:09.200
Sure.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.500
You weren't ready.

42:17.400 --> 42:18.400
To leave.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.400
This.

42:20.900 --> 42:22.700
The challenges,
the puzzles,

42:23.100 --> 42:24.300
the job.

42:25.100 --> 42:26.200
No.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.400
But Sara was.

42:31.700 --> 42:33.400
Yeah, she was.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.300
You can't stand in the way
of that.

42:38.700 --> 42:40.400
When it's time
for someone to move on,

42:40.400 --> 42:42.600
you just gotta let them go.

42:44.900 --> 42:46.600
Let's play the game, shall we?

42:47.500 --> 42:48.700
Okay.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.900
Mind if I record this?

42:55.200 --> 42:57.900
Scenario 12,
Hodges and Grissom.

43:00.300 --> 43:01.600
Okay, you walk
into the AV lab.

43:01.700 --> 43:03.100
You find Archie slumped
over his computer

43:03.200 --> 43:04.800
with a knife in his head...

43:04.900 --> 43:08.900
