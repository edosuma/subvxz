00:12.600 --> 00:14.800
Dude! Check it out, man! They're here!

00:14.890 --> 00:15.770
What's here?

00:15.810 --> 00:18.720
Our fake band t-Shirts that we ordered from that site last night.

00:18.750 --> 00:19.520
What?

00:19.550 --> 00:23.150
Last night, I asked you if you wanted to be in a band and you said...

00:24.740 --> 00:26.660
Yes! I wanna be in a band with you.

00:26.710 --> 00:28.890
Alright, but we gotta have a cool band name.

00:28.890 --> 00:31.490
What do you think of "Cool Dudes"?

00:31.490 --> 00:32.369
"Face Punch."

00:32.400 --> 00:33.550
"Rad 'N' Subtract."

00:33.550 --> 00:35.030
"Helicopter Crash."

00:35.050 --> 00:38.180
What about "Mustache Cash Stash"?

00:38.360 --> 00:39.730
That's it! That's it!

00:39.740 --> 00:42.180
Order the shirts! Order the shirts!

00:43.020 --> 00:44.870
Oh yeah, T-Shirts.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.480
Check it out! Bam!

00:46.620 --> 00:48.200
Mordecai and the Rigbys?

00:48.200 --> 00:50.140
What happened to Mustache Cash Stash?!

00:50.210 --> 00:52.550
I changed it. Awesome, right?

00:53.420 --> 00:54.870
But that's just our names!

00:54.900 --> 00:57.150
We aren't really going to wear these around, are we?

00:58.680 --> 01:00.560
Woah, rad shirts!

01:00.700 --> 01:01.760
What are those for?

01:01.950 --> 01:02.960
They're for our band.

01:03.020 --> 01:05.690
You guys are in a band? "Mordecai and the Rigbys"?

01:05.690 --> 01:07.330
That's so cool.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.890
No, no, no, we're not in a band, heh...

01:09.930 --> 01:12.420
So, what, it's some sort of fake band?

01:13.070 --> 01:15.220
No, it's a real band, but just...

01:15.320 --> 01:16.550
not a big deal, you know?

01:16.990 --> 01:19.150
Your band should play the open mic tomorrow night!

01:19.280 --> 01:21.450
Yeah, for sure, uh... totally.

01:21.450 --> 01:23.610
Awesome. I can't wait to see you guys play.

01:23.710 --> 01:24.870
Well, I guess I'll see you then.

01:24.900 --> 01:27.010
Yeah... see you then...

01:27.150 --> 01:27.990
then.

01:28.810 --> 01:30.200
What was that, man?!

01:30.220 --> 01:31.110
I dunno!

01:31.140 --> 01:33.630
I just didn't want her to think we had a stupid fake band!

01:33.630 --> 01:35.840
But now we gotta play that open mic tomorrow!

01:35.880 --> 01:38.150
OK, OK, we can totally do this.

01:38.170 --> 01:40.240
We just gotta learn one song by tomorrow night.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.240
- One song? - One song.

01:45.630 --> 01:47.800
- Ready? - Shreddy.

01:47.810 --> 01:49.430
One, two, three, four!

01:51.020 --> 01:52.510
OK, stop, stop.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.570
We need help.

01:54.860 --> 01:57.310
A two-man ensemble?

01:57.350 --> 01:59.300
What a charming idea!

01:59.440 --> 02:01.460
How'd you learn to be so good, Pops?

02:03.480 --> 02:05.920
Throw these records on the old talking machine

02:05.920 --> 02:09.000
and you'll be ready for your open mic in no time!

02:09.000 --> 02:10.720
Agh, you know about the open mic night?

02:10.720 --> 02:14.460
we're all going to be there!

02:16.670 --> 02:20.400
Wait. If we're gonna learn this in time, then you gotta take this seriously.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.420
- What? - Put on the shirt.

02:23.130 --> 02:25.320
Fine. Play the record.

02:28.450 --> 02:32.460
So, you want to become a musician? Bravo!

02:32.570 --> 02:36.700
Now, what is the first thing all good musicians require?

02:36.820 --> 02:37.600
Talent?

02:37.770 --> 02:38.680
Yes!

02:38.840 --> 02:40.350
Good personal hygiene...

02:40.360 --> 02:44.080
is the key  to becoming a successful gentleman musician!

02:44.950 --> 02:47.500
This is gonna take like ten years!

02:47.550 --> 02:50.000
Yeah, and there's still two more after this one!

02:50.050 --> 02:51.890
There's gotta be a faster way.

02:51.890 --> 02:52.860
...all washed up? Good!

02:52.860 --> 02:54.790
- All three at once? - Now just locate your...

03:01.600 --> 03:04.770
...one, two, three... A minor seventh... Harmonic can be tapped...

03:04.810 --> 03:07.510
Dude, this isn't working! I can't understand anything.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.170
Dude, we gotta keep going.

03:09.170 --> 03:11.240
Do you wanna look like an idiot at the open mic?

03:28.920 --> 03:29.640
What was that?

03:32.210 --> 03:34.560
- Dude, what's happening?! - I don't know!

03:58.150 --> 04:00.360
Dude, who are you guys?

04:00.510 --> 04:02.040
We're Mordecai and Rigby.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.770
Who the blazes are you?

04:05.300 --> 04:07.280
Just kiddin'. We know who you are.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.450
Coz we're you in ten years!

04:09.450 --> 04:10.490
You don't know it yet,

04:10.490 --> 04:13.190
but this is the moment  where we teach you how to rock!

04:13.580 --> 04:15.250
Dude, this is perfect!

04:15.270 --> 04:17.019
Wait, wait. We suck,

04:17.019 --> 04:19.339
and if you're us, doesn't that mean you suck too?

04:19.500 --> 04:21.060
Didn't you just hear us play?

04:21.120 --> 04:24.270
Yeah, we're super-successful musicians in the future.

04:24.270 --> 04:27.380
Yeah, look at us, dude! We're wearing sunglasses!

04:27.460 --> 04:30.740
Our future's so bright, we gotta wear shades.

04:30.830 --> 04:32.020
Awesome!

04:32.070 --> 04:33.310
Oh, hey - in the future,

04:33.310 --> 04:34.940
do we get that thing we always wanted?

04:34.940 --> 04:36.450
Oh, we got it.

04:39.050 --> 04:40.310
Awesome!

04:40.370 --> 04:43.370
in the future, do I get to go out with Margaret?

04:44.420 --> 04:46.690
I wouldn't wanna ruin the surprise.

04:47.920 --> 04:48.660
Look.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.310
We promise we'll get you ready for tomorrow night's gig

04:51.360 --> 04:53.150
if you're willing to put in the work.

04:53.270 --> 04:54.890
Yeah, whatever it takes.

04:54.900 --> 04:57.090
We said the same thing ten years ago.

04:57.260 --> 05:00.100
Awesome! Let's rock!

05:52.930 --> 05:54.750
That's it. You're ready!

05:54.990 --> 05:55.730
What?

05:55.730 --> 05:57.160
But we never learned how to play!

05:57.200 --> 05:58.990
We haven't even picked up a guitar.

05:58.990 --> 06:01.270
we got the look, we've got the moves down,

06:01.270 --> 06:03.050
I know the lyrics backwards and forwards.

06:03.050 --> 06:04.570
Just teach us how to play!

06:05.360 --> 06:07.680
Don't worry. You know enough. You're gonna be fine!

06:07.680 --> 06:09.740
Besides, it's too late to teach you anything else.

06:09.740 --> 06:11.040
Gig's in 20 minutes.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.540
We're screwed.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.990

06:43.680 --> 06:45.090
Yeah, for the fans.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.310
Wait, wait. I can explain, I can explain!

09:20.590 --> 09:21.930
We were lip-synching.

09:26.330 --> 09:28.290
Hey, look, I don't blame you.

09:28.290 --> 09:29.850
We thought we could just order some t-shirts

09:29.850 --> 09:31.580
and pass ourselves off as a band.

09:31.580 --> 09:34.140
But it turns out playing music's really hard to do.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.400
We just got caught up in the dream, man.

09:36.500 --> 09:39.090
And just for a little while it was real.

09:39.310 --> 09:40.250
But that's over.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.990
And lip-synching's not cool.

09:42.170 --> 09:43.910
So we're breaking up the band.

09:44.950 --> 09:46.730
Why'd you stop? It was going great.

09:46.730 --> 09:48.470
You tricked us into lip-synching!

09:48.580 --> 09:51.660
Look. We've become rich and famous because of lip-synching.

09:51.790 --> 09:53.410
Don't you wanna be a part of that?

09:53.550 --> 09:55.770
No, that's lame!

09:55.810 --> 09:58.620
You may be me, but that's not the me I wanna be.

09:58.660 --> 09:59.640
Me neither!

09:59.720 --> 10:02.070
Mordecai and the Rigbys is over.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.460
OK, dude! Think about what you're doing!

10:06.460 --> 10:07.790
Yeah, stop, man!

10:07.790 --> 10:10.440
If you break up the band, what are we gonna do in the future?!

10:10.520 --> 10:12.950
I wouldn't wanna ruin the surprise.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.830
Nooo!

10:25.160 --> 10:27.570
Yeah! Alright!

10:28.280 --> 10:31.220
I don't know why you thought this open mic would be embarrassing.

10:31.220 --> 10:32.820
This is awesome!

10:35.360 --> 10:37.400
Mordecai! Mordecai!

10:37.400 --> 10:39.400
Margaret! Margaret!

10:39.400 --> 10:41.290
- Mordecai! - Margaret!

10:42.030 --> 10:43.990
That was pretty cool, what you said up there!

10:44.040 --> 10:44.990
Thanks, Margaret.

10:44.990 --> 10:47.490
Oh, hey, have you met my new boyfriend, Angel?

10:48.050 --> 10:48.850
C'mon, baby.

10:48.970 --> 10:51.590
We don't wanna be late for our dinner reserva-ations!

10:51.740 --> 10:53.830
Oh, yeah. See you, guys!

10:54.100 --> 10:56.620
Oh, Angel, you have such a great voice.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.070
Maybe you should have just kept lip-synching.
