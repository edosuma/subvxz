02:30.500 --> 02:33.765
Lord to goodness, not again.

02:47.592 --> 02:49.897
- Howdy, Drago.
- Morning, Curly.

02:49.993 --> 02:53.450
Makes seven times this month
he come home swaggled.

02:53.546 --> 02:54.602
- Only six.
- Seven.

02:54.698 --> 02:56.810
Six. Once was his birthday, that don't count.

02:56.906 --> 02:58.251
Give me my buggy whip.

02:58.251 --> 03:01.612
Didn't have anything for breakfast
but two raw eggs and a mug of honey.

03:01.804 --> 03:03.532
- No.
- Curly.

03:03.628 --> 03:04.684
Yes, Boss?

03:07.949 --> 03:10.926
Don't say it's a fine morning,
or I'll shoot you.

03:13.711 --> 03:15.631
Get out of here, Bunyan.

03:16.111 --> 03:17.647
- Good morning.
- Morning.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.816
Carlos, what are you doing up there?

03:20.912 --> 03:25.521
I hope I get it this time, Mr. McLintock.
My brothers, they got the big hats already.

03:34.163 --> 03:36.084
All right, let them have at it.

03:49.239 --> 03:50.199
Get over.

03:50.295 --> 03:52.984
Ain't you gonna let me drive?
You promised me you would sometime.

03:53.080 --> 03:53.944
No.

03:56.249 --> 03:58.457
Boss, you better watch that turn
on the road!

03:58.553 --> 04:01.146
You're gonna kill both of us
one of these days.

04:04.603 --> 04:06.811
Thank you, Mr. Boss!

04:23.135 --> 04:25.248
You got cattle in the back, Boss.

04:32.450 --> 04:33.698
Give it up.

04:50.982 --> 04:52.134
Keep them going.

04:52.230 --> 04:56.167
Fifteen cents a pound,
all the way to Kansas City.

05:41.298 --> 05:44.563
Now, Boss, there's one old pensioner
I wished you'd pass up.

05:49.172 --> 05:50.613
- Bunny?
- Yeah.

05:50.805 --> 05:54.070
- Wish I knew where I'd seen his face before.
- He ain't an old-timer...

05:54.166 --> 05:56.086
he's just been around town
a couple of years.

05:56.182 --> 05:58.775
You have no milk of human kindness.

06:00.887 --> 06:02.232
Morning, Mr. McLintock.

06:02.616 --> 06:05.688
- Morning, Bunny.
- Well, I can see you're in good health.

06:05.784 --> 06:09.241
Never felt better,
contrary to what you may hear.

06:09.433 --> 06:12.506
Me, my kidneys ain't what they used to be...

06:13.082 --> 06:16.059
- and my liver's being leaving me bilious.
- Drago.

06:22.973 --> 06:25.181
- Hello, Ben.
- Hey, McLintock.

06:28.158 --> 06:30.943
- Drago, throw that in the buggy.
- Yes, sir.

06:32.095 --> 06:35.744
- That's a scrubby bunch of sooners.
- They are, at that.

06:37.472 --> 06:41.217
That ought to make Douglas happy.
Lining his pockets with land fees.

06:42.177 --> 06:43.906
What are we gonna do?

06:44.578 --> 06:47.939
I don't know what you're gonna do, Ben.
Me, I do nothing.

06:48.035 --> 06:52.164
Two hundred families,
a quarter of beef a week for a family.

06:52.644 --> 06:55.428
If they last two years,
that can be a sizeable number.

06:55.717 --> 06:57.349
I've got 20 head to...

06:57.445 --> 07:00.902
one of any other brand on the Mesa Verde.
I'm not hollering.

07:01.478 --> 07:04.167
Some of us haven't got all the money
in the world...

07:04.359 --> 07:08.200
and some of us ain't old and tired,
and feel like being put upon.

07:08.296 --> 07:10.888
You interest me, Young Ben. Go on.

07:11.464 --> 07:15.401
So the first time I find one of our hides
wearing our brand...

07:15.497 --> 07:19.818
hung on one of them settlers' fences,
I aim to kill me a plowboy.

07:20.875 --> 07:24.235
You do what you want, McLintock.
We'll do what we want.

07:24.908 --> 07:29.325
Fellows my age generally call me G.W.
Or McLintock.

07:29.901 --> 07:32.205
Youngsters call me Mr. McLintock.

07:34.414 --> 07:36.430
All right, Mr. McLintock.

07:36.526 --> 07:40.367
Not because I'm afraid of you.
You're the big he-stud of this country...

07:40.559 --> 07:43.728
and I reckon a fellow my age
should call you mister.

07:44.784 --> 07:48.529
He's full grown now, G.W.
He's a half owner of this spread.

07:49.778 --> 07:53.331
I made him a full partner
the day the doc gave me the long face.

07:53.427 --> 07:57.748
Well, you want him to vote the first time
this territory becomes a state, don't you?

07:57.844 --> 07:59.284
Of course I do.

07:59.380 --> 08:02.453
If these settlers get burned out,
there'll be a lot of hollering...

08:02.549 --> 08:04.949
that this country's too wild to be a state.

08:04.949 --> 08:08.214
We'll go on being a territory some more...

08:08.310 --> 08:10.615
with a lot of political appointees running it...

08:10.711 --> 08:13.591
according to what they learned
in some college...

08:13.688 --> 08:16.568
where they think
that cows are something you milk...

08:16.664 --> 08:19.449
and Indians are something
in front of a cigar store.

08:20.793 --> 08:23.386
I'm looking to you to hold Young Ben down.

08:23.482 --> 08:25.306
I'll do what I can.

08:26.843 --> 08:30.396
Come on over to the house once in a while,
we'll rack up a few hands of stud.

08:30.588 --> 08:32.412
G. W., that'd be just fine.

08:43.455 --> 08:45.663
It's a nice morning, ain't it, Boss?

08:45.855 --> 08:47.968
Everybody's entitled to their own opinion.

08:48.064 --> 08:51.233
Like that again?
Here's something that'll cheer you up.

08:51.233 --> 08:54.305
About 1,000 head,
I figure they'll bring about $12.50.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.802
They're not as fat as I'd like to ship.

08:56.802 --> 08:59.299
- They all off the North Range?
- Yes, sir.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.676
Settlers. Every one of them with a plow
and a Bible...

09:04.772 --> 09:07.365
and not the slightest idea
what the range is for.

09:09.189 --> 09:10.245
Drago!

09:11.109 --> 09:13.510
- Drag out that hogleg.
- Yes, sir.

09:13.606 --> 09:15.142
Get me some attention.

09:18.503 --> 09:21.192
People, people!

09:27.626 --> 09:30.314
Come on, all of you. Gather round.

09:30.794 --> 09:33.291
People, come on. Gather round.

09:36.268 --> 09:37.708
I'm McLintock.

09:37.996 --> 09:41.357
You people plan to homestead
and farm the Mesa Verde.

09:41.549 --> 09:44.430
Yes, sir.
The government give us each 160 acres.

09:44.526 --> 09:47.502
The government
never gave anybody anything.

09:47.598 --> 09:49.807
Some years back, a lot like you came in.

09:50.479 --> 09:54.224
They had a pretty good first year.
Good summer, easy winter.

09:54.896 --> 09:57.777
But the next year,
the last rain was in February...

09:58.353 --> 10:02.386
and by June, even the jack rabbits
had sense enough to get off the Mesa.

10:02.386 --> 10:06.227
Folks, do you know who that is?
That's McLintock.

10:06.515 --> 10:08.724
George Washington McLintock.

10:09.204 --> 10:11.124
I told them that, Douglas.

10:11.412 --> 10:16.117
He controls the water rights
on 200 square miles of range.

10:17.558 --> 10:20.438
You know that lumber you got?
It came from his land...

10:20.534 --> 10:23.607
cut by his loggers and milled in his mills.

10:23.895 --> 10:28.216
Douglas, I come close to killing you
a couple of times when we were younger.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.617
Saddens me I didn't.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.786
Can you imagine a man who owns all that...

10:33.882 --> 10:36.858
and mines, too, I forgot to mention them.

10:37.338 --> 10:40.411
All that, and he's begrudging poor people...

10:40.603 --> 10:44.540
a measly 160 acres.

10:44.828 --> 10:46.365
That right, Mr. McLintock?

10:46.461 --> 10:50.782
- You begrudge us a little free land?
- There's no such thing as free land.

10:50.974 --> 10:54.335
If you make these homesteads go,
you'll have earned every acre of it.

10:54.623 --> 10:57.599
But you just can't make them go
on the Mesa Verde.

10:58.080 --> 11:02.593
God made that country for buffalo.
Serves pretty well for cattle...

11:02.689 --> 11:04.513
but it hates the plow.

11:05.089 --> 11:07.682
And even the government should know...

11:07.778 --> 11:11.331
that you can't farm
6,000 feet above sea level.

11:11.619 --> 11:14.500
- Any trouble, Mr. McLintock?
- No trouble, Jeff.

11:23.718 --> 11:26.502
- How about you, Douglas?
- Douglas?

11:27.271 --> 11:31.208
Just plain Douglas?
And you call him Mr. McLintock.

11:31.784 --> 11:32.744
Why?

11:33.608 --> 11:36.489
Well, Douglas,
I guess it's because he earned it.

11:43.595 --> 11:45.611
- Mr. McLintock?
- Yeah.

11:46.187 --> 11:49.164
I'm a good hand with cattle, Mr. McLintock.
I'd like a job.

11:49.452 --> 11:53.197
Well, you look strong enough.
You come in with those sooners?

11:53.293 --> 11:55.886
Yes, sir,
but we don't have a homestead, and...

11:55.982 --> 11:57.518
Can't use you.

12:12.114 --> 12:14.226
Tough life, ain't it, sonny?

12:15.186 --> 12:18.739
Hell, ain't much future in being a farmer
around these parts.

12:39.288 --> 12:42.457
Ladies, this is the finest Chantilly lace
available anywhere.

12:42.553 --> 12:46.106
- Chant/lly Mr. Birnbaum.
- Well, believe me, it's the best.

12:47.162 --> 12:49.467
Excuse me, please.
Look around, take your time.

12:49.659 --> 12:53.116
Drago, I got 1,000 Havana cigars
and 12 of those hats for you over there.

12:53.212 --> 12:55.228
Them twelve big hats ain't gonna last long...

12:55.324 --> 12:58.781
the way some folks have been dipping
into that redeye these days.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.046
Good morning, G.W.

13:02.142 --> 13:04.158
Good morning. I stole some stick candy.

13:04.254 --> 13:06.559
Please help yourself. Come on in.

13:09.824 --> 13:13.761
Davey, you can forget about
saddling up the horse. Come in here!

13:14.049 --> 13:15.969
- Problem?
- Yes.

13:17.025 --> 13:20.578
Well, if I were blacks,
I'd move the queen's bishop to king four.

13:24.227 --> 13:25.571
Yeah, you might be right.

13:25.667 --> 13:28.356
You know, I was just starting
to work this out when the letter came.

13:28.452 --> 13:29.412
Letter?

13:29.508 --> 13:31.621
- It was...
- What happened? Don't you...

13:31.717 --> 13:33.637
- Morning, Mr. McLintock.
- Morning, Davey.

13:33.733 --> 13:36.038
You being here saved me a trip.

13:36.806 --> 13:39.687
That hat and suit of clothes
you picked out on my birthday...

13:39.783 --> 13:42.279
well, instead of this cowboy hat...

13:42.376 --> 13:46.505
I'd like to have this one,
if it's all right with you, sir.

13:46.601 --> 13:48.329
That's all right with me, Davey.

13:48.425 --> 13:51.882
Of course, that looks like the kind of a hat
a fellow would wear down Main street...

13:51.978 --> 13:54.474
- to start a fight.
- I don't need a city hat for that.

13:54.570 --> 13:56.299
All I got to do is walk down the street...

13:56.395 --> 13:59.660
and some wiseacre will call me an Indian,
and just like that, the fight's on.

13:59.852 --> 14:03.693
Davey, the letter. It's for you,
and you are an Indian.

14:04.365 --> 14:08.302
Yes, I know I'm an Indian.
But I'm also the fastest runner in town.

14:08.398 --> 14:11.471
I've got a college education,
and I'm the railroad telegrapher.

14:11.663 --> 14:14.831
But does anybody say,
Hello, college man, or, Hello, runner...

14:14.927 --> 14:18.192
or, Hello, telegrapher?
No, not even, Hello, knothead.

14:18.288 --> 14:19.248
Davey.

14:19.345 --> 14:21.649
It's always, Let the Indian do it.

14:21.745 --> 14:23.474
Will you go out in the store
and help the ladies?

14:23.570 --> 14:27.314
All right. I'm also bookkeeper,
part-time clerk.

14:28.083 --> 14:30.867
Always, Let the Indian do it.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.228
A lady brought that out here this morning...

14:34.324 --> 14:37.109
asked for it to be taken out
to the home ranch for you.

14:37.205 --> 14:39.990
Handsome lady. Kind of tall, with red hair.

14:40.086 --> 14:43.446
Called me Mr. Birnbaum,
just as if she'd never seen me before...

14:43.446 --> 14:47.383
and as if that veil that covered her face
would keep me from recognizing her.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.936
I though she was in New York or Europe,
or someplace.

14:51.512 --> 14:52.953
So did I.

14:53.049 --> 14:56.794
Jake, you better throw in a couple
extra cases of the boss's favorite bourbon.

14:56.794 --> 14:59.770
That stuff sure gets used up fast
out at our place.

14:59.866 --> 15:03.323
Which reminds me,
you better start tapering off.

15:06.204 --> 15:08.701
- Katherine's in town.
- Katy?

15:16.863 --> 15:17.727
Ladies.

15:19.071 --> 15:19.935
Morning.

15:24.832 --> 15:27.521
- Morning, Mr. McLintock.
- Morning, Mr. McLintock.

15:34.723 --> 15:37.219
- Good morning.
- Morning, Mac.

15:37.315 --> 15:39.236
- Hi, Mac darling.
- Fauntleroy.

15:39.620 --> 15:40.676
Good morning, G.W.

15:40.676 --> 15:42.981
What are you doing in here?
Why aren't you out at the desk?

15:43.077 --> 15:44.325
Just helping out the bartender.

15:44.421 --> 15:47.782
Yeah, I see a busy day.
Give me the key to Room 17.

15:47.878 --> 15:49.030
What?

15:49.606 --> 15:51.623
17, and don't advertise it.

15:54.792 --> 15:56.904
Here they come, Mr. McLintock.

16:00.745 --> 16:01.705
Set them up.

16:01.801 --> 16:03.146
- Beer.
- Whiskey.

16:05.546 --> 16:06.699
Day off?

16:08.427 --> 16:09.579
Off day.

16:12.076 --> 16:14.380
Wonder what he's so preoccupied about?

16:14.477 --> 16:16.781
- Haven't you heard?
- No. What?

16:16.877 --> 16:19.086
- Katy's back in town.
- Katy?

16:19.182 --> 16:21.678
Yes, dear. The social arbiter.

16:23.599 --> 16:26.191
- Hi, sonny.
- Good morning.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.128
He sure is a polite one.

16:30.224 --> 16:34.930
- Mr. McLintock, I don't wanna bother you...
- I'm sorry, boy. I told you, no job.

17:07.962 --> 17:09.306
Katherine.

17:09.978 --> 17:12.090
George Washington McLintock.

17:19.291 --> 17:21.213
I thought you'd want this.

17:26.685 --> 17:28.511
First dig of the spur.

17:28.991 --> 17:31.679
But who am I to upset your plans?

17:33.120 --> 17:36.865
- Don't you feel kind of silly?
- I never feel silly.

17:37.825 --> 17:40.033
It's because you have no sense of humor.

17:40.033 --> 17:43.106
Why couldn't we sit down
in the hotel dining room...

17:43.202 --> 17:45.315
and talk about whatever it is
you want to talk about?

17:45.507 --> 17:47.715
Or why couldn't you
just come over to the house?

17:47.907 --> 17:49.828
And have everybody know
that we're meeting?

17:49.924 --> 17:53.477
Everybody knows,
and what's the difference? We're married.

17:53.765 --> 17:56.741
That is something I should like to change.

18:02.791 --> 18:04.711
You know the answer, Katy.

18:05.672 --> 18:07.784
That isn't why you sent for me.

18:08.552 --> 18:10.377
Let's get to the rat-killing.

18:11.241 --> 18:15.274
That's just the kind of remark
that's always endeared you to me.

18:15.850 --> 18:18.635
- Let us open the discussion.
- Very well.

18:18.923 --> 18:23.052
Our daughter is coming home in a few days.
Rather, she's coming here.

18:23.244 --> 18:27.469
It was a slip of the tongue that made me
refer to this ugly hamlet as home.

18:27.661 --> 18:31.118
Our daughter.
Is it so hard to say her name? It's Becky.

18:31.118 --> 18:33.518
Rebecca! I hate that name.

18:34.191 --> 18:36.207
Anyway, she's coming home...

18:36.783 --> 18:40.048
and I hoped to persuade you
to let her live with me...

18:40.048 --> 18:42.929
part of the time in the capital,
part of the time in New York...

18:43.025 --> 18:46.097
and of course, Newport during the season.

18:47.826 --> 18:50.707
You're whistling in the wind, Katy.

18:50.803 --> 18:52.435
If she stays here...

18:52.915 --> 18:55.604
she'll become just as crude and as vulgar
as all of this country.

18:55.700 --> 18:59.061
And if she goes your way,
she'll be all show and no stay.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.087
No go, Kate.

19:08.855 --> 19:11.928
I hate you. Oh, how I hate you.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.289
Half the people in the world are women.

19:16.057 --> 19:18.841
Why does it have to be you that stirs me?

19:21.530 --> 19:24.123
- You animal.
- That's the story.

19:24.699 --> 19:27.868
I saw your picture in the paper
at the Governor's ball.

19:27.868 --> 19:30.172
You were dancing with the Governor.

19:30.268 --> 19:31.997
At least he's a gentleman.

19:32.093 --> 19:33.629
I doubt that.

19:33.821 --> 19:36.606
You have to be a man first
before you're a gentleman.

19:36.798 --> 19:38.622
He misses on both counts.

19:57.827 --> 20:01.380
- Hey, Sonny. You gonna ask him again?
- Nope.

20:01.956 --> 20:05.413
Boy, you gotta pocket your pride,
you gotta beg.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.813
You better listen to an expert, sonny.

20:07.909 --> 20:11.750
I'm telling you, you got to grovel.
Human nature, gets him every time.

20:12.230 --> 20:15.015
Mister, leave me alone.

20:17.032 --> 20:19.528
Everybody does it, one way or another.

20:27.114 --> 20:28.842
About that job, Mr. McLintock.

20:28.938 --> 20:32.107
I already told you, son.
I've got no need for farmers...

20:32.203 --> 20:34.892
- or use for them.
- Just one minute, Mr. McLintock.

20:35.756 --> 20:39.309
My father died last month.
That's how come we lost our homestead.

20:39.501 --> 20:43.342
I've got a mother and a little sister to feed.
I need that job badly.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.839
- What's your name?
- Devlin Warren.

20:46.127 --> 20:47.471
You've got a job, son.

20:47.567 --> 20:50.352
See my home ranch foreman,
he's over at the corral.

20:56.401 --> 20:58.994
Step down off of that carriage, mister.

21:04.275 --> 21:05.907
Hold that hogleg!

21:07.636 --> 21:11.957
I've been punched many a time in my life,
but never for hiring anybody.

21:13.685 --> 21:15.318
I don't know what to say.

21:16.278 --> 21:19.735
I never begged before. Turned my stomach.

21:20.887 --> 21:23.768
I suppose I should have been grateful
you gave me the job.

21:23.864 --> 21:27.321
Gave? Boy, you got it all wrong.

21:28.185 --> 21:30.777
I don't give jobs. I hire men.

21:31.450 --> 21:34.234
You intend to give this man
a full day's work, don't you, boy?

21:34.234 --> 21:36.443
You mean you're still hiring me,
Mr. McLintock?

21:36.539 --> 21:39.900
Well, yes, sir. I mean,
I'll certainly deliver a fair day's work.

21:39.996 --> 21:42.876
For that I'll pay you a fair day's wage.

21:42.780 --> 21:45.949
You won't give me anything,
and I won't give you anything.

21:46.045 --> 21:48.926
We both hold up our heads.
Where do you live?

21:49.118 --> 21:51.134
The settlers' encampment,
down by the mine.

21:52.191 --> 21:54.303
- That's your plug?
- Yes, sir.

21:54.399 --> 21:57.280
Well, hop on him,
and we'll go get your gear.

22:26.663 --> 22:29.544
- Morning, Mr. McLintock.
- Morning, Mr. Pourboire.

22:46.636 --> 22:50.477
I'm sure that all you fine people
are interested in knowing...

22:50.573 --> 22:54.798
just what portion of this new land
will be your new home.

22:56.910 --> 23:00.655
Jones and McAIlister, since you've been
more or less the leaders of our group...

23:00.751 --> 23:04.400
I'd like to have you come up
and check the exact location.

23:05.745 --> 23:07.665
Won't be a minute, sir.

23:13.523 --> 23:16.115
Go after that boy and give him $30.

23:16.691 --> 23:19.668
Tell him McLintock
pays his riders a month in advance.

23:19.764 --> 23:22.453
From the looks of things,
they can sure use it, too.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.446
Mom, it's Mr. Drago.

23:28.118 --> 23:29.270
Morning.

23:30.423 --> 23:34.072
Well, and to what do we owe this visit
from the cattle baron?

23:34.552 --> 23:37.912
I've got a touch of hangover, bureaucrat.
Don't push me.

23:38.969 --> 23:40.121
McLin.

23:46.555 --> 23:48.571
Say, those are Indians.

23:48.667 --> 23:52.220
- Are there Indians in this homestead land?
- Friendly Indians, my boy.

23:53.468 --> 23:56.829
- McLin.
- Running Buffalo.

23:57.693 --> 24:01.438
McLin, long time we no get drunk together.

24:01.534 --> 24:04.031
And it's gonna be a lot longer time...

24:04.127 --> 24:06.719
'cause it's against the law,
and you're with the Sheriff.

24:06.815 --> 24:08.256
And have I got my hands full.

24:08.448 --> 24:11.713
They came into town to meet the train.
The old Indian chiefs are coming home.

24:11.809 --> 24:13.345
I heard they'd been pardoned.

24:13.537 --> 24:16.418
They don't know when it's arriving.
This week, next week, or next month.

24:16.514 --> 24:18.722
So in the meantime,
I've got to do something with them.

24:18.818 --> 24:21.315
Could I cut out a couple of head
of your steers to feed them?

24:21.411 --> 24:24.196
Otherwise, some of these settlers' milk cows
are going to disappear.

24:24.292 --> 24:27.845
- That's right, McLin.
- Cut out whatever you need.

24:27.941 --> 24:31.974
Sheriff, are you gonna camp
these savages with all these settlers?

24:32.070 --> 24:33.990
You're asking for trouble.

24:34.182 --> 24:36.775
Mr. Douglas,
I already have plenty of trouble.

24:36.871 --> 24:38.407
Please stay off of my back.

24:38.599 --> 24:41.576
Running Buffalo,
bring your people over to the clay slide.

24:45.993 --> 24:47.529
Hello, Mr. McLin.

24:47.721 --> 24:50.602
Tiny Mouth, it's nice to see you.

24:50.698 --> 24:52.042
You wouldn't believe it now...

24:52.139 --> 24:55.115
but 20 years ago,
she was a mighty handsome maid.

24:56.556 --> 24:59.724
Twenty years ago, you thought so, too,
Mr. Douglas.

25:06.926 --> 25:10.671
It was just like this.
I had a dead bead on old Running Buffalo...

25:10.767 --> 25:13.072
and my Sharp. 50 caliber misfired.

25:13.264 --> 25:15.472
That was back in that trouble
in the '40s, remember?

25:15.568 --> 25:16.913
I remember.

25:17.393 --> 25:19.697
You want to taste something
that come directly from heaven?

25:19.793 --> 25:20.753
No.

25:28.051 --> 25:30.836
- Where'd you get this?
- That boy's mama baked them.

25:31.508 --> 25:33.140
You thinking the same thing I am?

25:33.237 --> 25:36.597
She's a widow woman, Boss,
and she's got a long, hard row to hoe.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.422
Hire her.

25:43.031 --> 25:45.143
I always said you had a heap of sense.

25:46.008 --> 25:48.216
Mr. McLintock, this is my mother.

25:50.425 --> 25:53.209
- Your mother?
- And my sister.

25:53.305 --> 25:57.338
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. McLintock.
- Ma'am, this here's my boss...

25:57.530 --> 26:00.795
and he has a few choice words
to say about your biscuits.

26:03.100 --> 26:04.732
Yes, Mr. McLintock?

26:08.093 --> 26:09.533
They're great.

26:22.016 --> 26:24.801
You old Cantonese reprobate, how about it?

26:24.897 --> 26:27.394
You fire me, I kill myself.

26:27.874 --> 26:30.947
I'm not talking about firing you,
I'm retiring you.

26:31.043 --> 26:33.923
You've been rustling food for us
for 30 years.

26:34.307 --> 26:36.324
We're gonna put you out to pasture...

26:36.420 --> 26:39.205
all you'll have to do is give advice,
be one of the family.

26:39.301 --> 26:42.469
- I kill myself.
- I may save you the trouble.

26:42.565 --> 26:43.910
Look, Ching.

26:44.678 --> 26:49.191
If you kill yourself, I'll cut off your pigtail,
and you ain't never gonna get to heaven.

26:49.671 --> 26:53.224
- I'll be one of the family?
- I give you my solemn word.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.760
Pretty crummy family.

26:54.856 --> 26:58.793
Drink too much, get in fights,
yell all the time.

27:00.330 --> 27:01.962
Cut off his pigtail.

27:02.058 --> 27:04.747
All right, I'll be one of the family.

27:17.326 --> 27:19.438
I hope everything is satisfactory.

27:19.630 --> 27:22.895
This is such a big house.
It'll take me a while to get used to things.

27:22.991 --> 27:26.352
Now, please don't hesitate to tell me
if anything is wrong.

27:26.448 --> 27:28.080
No bird's-nest soup.

27:31.249 --> 27:34.802
- Otherwise, just fine. Everything all nicely.
- Food's heaven, ma'am.

27:34.994 --> 27:36.915
Best apple pie I ever ate.

27:37.011 --> 27:39.795
Curly's right, ma'am.
Hated to leave that last bite.

27:39.795 --> 27:43.444
- Shall we celebrate with a drink?
- Carlos, come and help me with the dishes.

27:43.540 --> 27:45.173
Alice, do you want to help, too?

27:45.269 --> 27:47.573
- Yes, Drago.
- All right, pitch in.

27:48.149 --> 27:50.934
I'll wash, and you kids can dry.
Is that good? Here.

28:03.129 --> 28:07.450
Don't seem possible one woman
could use all of them clothes.

28:07.546 --> 28:10.043
You keep a civil tongue
in your unprepossessing face.

28:10.139 --> 28:11.771
- Yes, ma'am.
- And unload my baggage, please.

28:11.867 --> 28:13.019
Yes, ma'am.

28:13.307 --> 28:16.572
By the way, what does that word,
unprepossessing, mean?

28:21.950 --> 28:24.542
- Mrs. McLintock.
- Hello, Carlos.

28:24.830 --> 28:27.519
Run and help the driver with my luggage.

28:27.615 --> 28:31.552
I couldn't trust anyone else in this house
to do anything correctly.

28:34.049 --> 28:36.929
- Luggage? Give him a hand, Curly.
- Yes, Boss.

28:37.313 --> 28:39.714
- Mr. McLintock.
- Are you moving back in?

28:39.810 --> 28:43.363
Yes, but nothing has changed
except my place of residence.

28:43.747 --> 28:46.147
And I'd be willing to put up with savages...

28:46.147 --> 28:48.356
rather than be denied the company
of my daughter.

28:48.452 --> 28:51.045
And I'm proving that by moving in here.

28:51.141 --> 28:55.366
Mr. McLintock, since it's my first day,
would you excuse me if I...

28:55.462 --> 28:59.111
Go ahead. Katherine, this is Dev Warren.

28:59.495 --> 29:01.223
Joined the outfit today.

29:01.223 --> 29:03.624
- Pleased, ma'am.
- Thank you.

29:06.024 --> 29:09.769
Well, how refreshing.
A polite young man here.

29:10.057 --> 29:12.362
- Where did he come from?
- He's a farmer.

29:12.458 --> 29:14.858
- A farmer?
- Well, I'll be doggone.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.875
Kate, welcome home.

29:16.971 --> 29:20.524
What on earth are you doing
in that idiotic-looking outfit?

29:20.812 --> 29:23.693
- And don't you dare call me Kate.
- That here my butlering suit.

29:23.693 --> 29:26.189
I'm butlering for the boss.
And I'm sorry, Katherine.

29:26.285 --> 29:29.070
That Kate kind of slipped out
from the times I remembered you...

29:29.166 --> 29:31.278
as being nice people.

29:35.215 --> 29:38.672
Are you going to stand there
with that stupid look on your face...

29:38.768 --> 29:41.265
while the hired help insults your wife?

29:42.033 --> 29:43.473
He's just ignorant.

29:43.569 --> 29:45.682
He doesn't know any better
than to tell the truth.

29:45.874 --> 29:47.794
And I can't help this stupid look.

29:47.698 --> 29:51.347
I started acquiring it
as you gained in social prominence.

29:51.539 --> 29:54.996
Mrs. McLintock,
where do you want I should...

29:55.092 --> 29:57.493
- What?
- Put them in the master bedroom.

30:02.006 --> 30:06.231
Yes. But move Mr. Mclintock's things
into another room.

30:06.327 --> 30:10.648
The one back of the stairs would be best, so
that he can't wake up the entire household...

30:10.840 --> 30:12.568
- when he comes home every night...
- Here's the...

30:12.665 --> 30:15.449
...just before daybreak.
- Yes, ma'am.

30:19.002 --> 30:20.634
Excuse me.

30:21.019 --> 30:24.667
- Here's your cigars, Mr. McLintock.
- I am Mrs. McLintock.

30:24.859 --> 30:26.492
Kate, I mean, Katherine...

30:26.588 --> 30:29.181
this is the cook,
this is the lady does the cooking for us.

30:29.277 --> 30:31.677
Mrs. Warren, Mrs. McLintock.

30:31.773 --> 30:34.846
- How do you do?
- Very pleased to meet you, Mrs. McLintock.

30:35.038 --> 30:36.670
- Very pleased.
- Likewise.

30:36.766 --> 30:40.319
You see, I just came to work here today,
and I guess I jumped to the conclusion...

30:40.415 --> 30:43.104
that this was a bachelor's household.

30:44.928 --> 30:47.425
It is, and then again, it isn't.

30:47.905 --> 30:51.458
I will explain so everything
will be quite clear, Mrs. Wallace.

30:52.034 --> 30:53.474
Mrs. Warren.

30:55.683 --> 30:57.027
Mrs. Warren.

30:57.795 --> 31:01.348
It has been a bachelor's household
for quite some time.

31:02.117 --> 31:05.093
And it will be again,
just as soon as I'm out of here.

31:05.189 --> 31:07.494
Which will be as quickly
as I can make arrangements...

31:07.590 --> 31:10.086
to take my daughter back East with me.

31:10.375 --> 31:13.159
You see, she's coming home from school
in a few days...

31:13.351 --> 31:16.808
and then we'll be off together,
and you can return to conducting yourself...

31:16.904 --> 31:19.401
as you consider proper
in a bachelor's household.

31:19.401 --> 31:21.417
- Katy.
- Shut up.

31:21.993 --> 31:24.682
Until then, I am mistress in this house.

31:25.450 --> 31:27.467
And I will give the orders.

31:28.043 --> 31:30.251
- I'll want my breakfast served in bed.
- Gonna let her...

31:30.251 --> 31:32.172
- Ain't you gonna say nothing, Boss?
- No.

31:32.268 --> 31:34.572
One poached egg, tea, toast.

31:34.668 --> 31:38.797
G. W., as soon as my things are put away,
I'll want to talk to you about Rebecca.

31:39.182 --> 31:43.311
Yes, Mrs. McLintock. Indeed, Mrs. McLintock.

31:43.407 --> 31:45.039
Of course, Mrs. McLintock.

31:45.231 --> 31:47.824
The toast, lightly browned and unbuttered.

31:49.072 --> 31:50.608
Of course, ma'am.

31:52.721 --> 31:54.929
Wait a minute, now, Boss.
Where do you think you're going?

31:55.025 --> 31:56.850
I just remembered, I got a date.

31:56.946 --> 31:58.674
But she said
she wanted to have a talk with you.

31:58.770 --> 32:00.019
I heard.

32:05.876 --> 32:08.373
- Good evening, Lem.
- Good evening, Mr. Mac.

32:11.733 --> 32:15.094
Say, Mr. Mac,
what does unprepossessing mean?

32:16.535 --> 32:19.991
I was called that once, Lem.
Looked it up in the dictionary.

32:20.376 --> 32:23.160
- It's best you don't know what it means.
- Thank you.

32:33.243 --> 32:35.835
What am I gonna tell her
when she asks where you went?

32:35.835 --> 32:37.852
When in doubt, tell the truth.

32:38.236 --> 32:40.733
She wouldn't expect that from you anyway.

32:41.693 --> 32:45.918
- Where's Mr. McLintock going?
- There he goes, burning his last bridge.

32:46.302 --> 32:50.047
You see a yellow streak about a foot wide
running up and down his backbone?

32:50.143 --> 32:51.679
On Mr. McLintock?

32:52.351 --> 32:55.712
- He ain't afraid of nothing.
- I once thought that.

33:14.917 --> 33:17.317
- Drago?
- Yes, ma'am.

33:17.509 --> 33:20.198
- Was that...
- He took off, lit out.

33:20.294 --> 33:22.407
- I told him I wanted to talk to him.
- Yes, ma'am.

33:22.503 --> 33:24.423
I was standing right over here
when you said it...

33:24.519 --> 33:26.632
and I was standing right out there
on those front steps...

33:26.728 --> 33:28.840
when he walked up the horse,
grabbed a hunk of mane...

33:28.840 --> 33:31.529
- stepped up on him and sunk spur.
- Where did he go?

33:31.817 --> 33:34.506
Last time I saw him, he was going east,
but you know him...

33:34.602 --> 33:37.290
he is liable to go north, south, or west.

33:37.578 --> 33:38.827
Get me a carriage.

33:38.923 --> 33:40.843
- Yes, ma'am, but...
- But what?

33:42.956 --> 33:46.413
Maybe you shouldn't follow him into,
maybe, where he's going into.

33:46.797 --> 33:48.717
What does that mean?

33:48.813 --> 33:51.118
I don't know, but I wish I hadn't said it.

33:51.214 --> 33:53.614
- Just get the carriage.
- Yes, ma'am.

33:56.015 --> 33:58.223
- What happened?
- Get the barouche.

33:58.319 --> 34:01.104
- The barouche?
- Hitch it up, she wants to go to town.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.505
But Mr. McLintock
never said anything to me about it.

34:03.601 --> 34:05.617
Look, young fellow. I'm the...

34:06.385 --> 34:09.362
I'm the ramrod around this place.
You better start giving me a yes, sir...

34:09.458 --> 34:12.147
or you going to get the roof of this house
pulled down on your head.

34:12.243 --> 34:13.299
Yes, sir.

34:18.964 --> 34:21.268
- Hello, Davey!
- Hi, Mr. McLinctock.

34:21.364 --> 34:23.574
- New broom, eh?
- Sweeps clean.

34:26.166 --> 34:29.911
- Hello, Bunny, how is everything?
- Fine, Mr. McLintock.

34:30.775 --> 34:32.312
I'll get you next time.

34:43.353 --> 34:44.795
Two more, Elmer.

34:46.523 --> 34:49.788
Well, look who's here.

34:51.036 --> 34:53.917
What'll it be, Mac? Same as usual?

34:54.877 --> 34:55.933
Ladies.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.102
- Evening, G.W.
- Jake.

34:59.678 --> 35:01.023
- Wrong move.
- What?

35:01.407 --> 35:03.999
Chess problem. Wueen's in danger.

35:23.108 --> 35:24.644
I suppose you can do that.

35:25.605 --> 35:28.005
Camille, you're on your own.

35:30.310 --> 35:31.750
Mrs. McLintock.

35:36.455 --> 35:38.856
I'm Camille, Camille Reedbottom.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.505
I'm learning the game of chess.

35:44.329 --> 35:47.306
Thought it would give me something
to pass the time.

35:47.594 --> 35:49.995
See, I have nothing to do all day long.

35:52.203 --> 35:53.932
I just remembered something.

36:02.574 --> 36:04.878
Katherine, I didn't hear you come in.

36:04.974 --> 36:08.815
Mr. McLintock,
I told you that I wanted to talk to you.

36:08.911 --> 36:09.967
Not now.

36:10.544 --> 36:12.752
Could I get you a glass of sherry, Katherine?

36:12.848 --> 36:15.345
Thank you, Mr. Birnbaum, I could use one.

36:15.441 --> 36:18.610
I came into town behind a runaway team.

36:19.282 --> 36:21.586
Drago never could handle horses.

36:21.682 --> 36:24.659
It was that young man
whose mother pretends to be your cook.

36:24.755 --> 36:28.308
- Katherine, your wine.
- Thank you, Mr. Birnbaum.

36:37.334 --> 36:40.407
Now, Mr. McLintock,
we have an awful lot to talk over.

36:40.599 --> 36:44.824
First thing I learned about Indian fighting
was to wait for daylight.

36:44.920 --> 36:47.705
What does our conversation
got to do with Indian fighting?

36:47.801 --> 36:51.450
Indian fighting is good experience
for our kind of conversations.

36:51.930 --> 36:53.658
It'll wait, Katherine.

36:54.138 --> 36:58.267
Evening, Sheriff, Mr. McLintock.
We had quite a ride out here.

36:58.363 --> 37:01.916
- I finally got that team settled down.
- It's your move.

37:02.012 --> 37:05.181
- No, it's your move. I just cancelled.
- Now, look here.

37:05.277 --> 37:07.966
You're not going to sit here all night long
and play chess...

37:07.966 --> 37:10.270
when the matter of our daughter
remains unsettled.

37:10.366 --> 37:13.727
I am going to remain here and play chess,
and the matter of our daughter is settled.

37:13.823 --> 37:16.224
- She stays.
- Such stubbornness.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.432
Katherine, your hair.

37:21.505 --> 37:23.809
It is a mess after that awful ride.

37:23.905 --> 37:27.458
No, it's just that
I haven't seen you for a long time...

37:27.746 --> 37:30.435
and it seems to me,
the last time I saw you...

37:30.531 --> 37:32.932
your hair was a little darker, no?

37:38.501 --> 37:41.862
It's a funny thing,
the tricks a man's memory will play.

37:42.342 --> 37:46.759
Mr. Birnbaum, I think that you've
completely lost your mind.

37:46.855 --> 37:50.504
- You have done something to your hair.
- I have not!

37:52.808 --> 37:54.825
If I had, it'd be none of your business.

37:54.825 --> 37:58.090
Certainly not going to put myself
in the place of those Blondine trollops...

37:58.186 --> 37:59.818
that you seem to prefer.

38:01.163 --> 38:02.411
- Take it.
- Oh.

38:03.947 --> 38:05.195
- Fill it.
- Oh.

38:19.407 --> 38:20.559
Good morning.

38:22.480 --> 38:26.129
- You fellows still at it? All night?
- A McLintock never quits.

38:26.897 --> 38:30.546
But a Birnbaum has to.
Besides, the game is over. You got me.

38:30.546 --> 38:33.330
No, Mr. Birnbaum,
you still got a good game.

38:33.426 --> 38:35.347
You play chess?

38:35.923 --> 38:37.459
Please, take over.

38:42.164 --> 38:44.085
- Pretty good?
- Fair.

38:44.757 --> 38:48.886
It looks like I won't have to come into town
always to get a game.

38:50.134 --> 38:52.055
Remember, I'm a bad loser.

38:54.744 --> 38:56.664
- It's your move.
- Yes, sir.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.365
Good morning.

39:19.806 --> 39:21.150
Good morning.

39:22.878 --> 39:24.607
It's morning already.

39:25.471 --> 39:26.911
Cup of coffee?

39:28.352 --> 39:29.696
Yes, thanks, Jake.

39:32.001 --> 39:33.921
You're welcome, Katherine.

39:35.650 --> 39:38.530
- Got any cream?
- Canned cows' milk.

39:38.818 --> 39:40.163
That'll do.

39:41.699 --> 39:43.523
Good old condensed milk.

39:45.348 --> 39:46.980
That reminds me...

39:47.460 --> 39:49.861
I was cleaning out my desk the other day...

39:49.957 --> 39:52.838
and I found something
I wanted to return to you.

39:57.351 --> 39:58.695
Here it is.

40:05.993 --> 40:07.913
It's a medal, remember?

40:08.874 --> 40:12.042
From the President
of the United States of America...

40:12.426 --> 40:15.211
to First Sergeant Michael Patrick Gilhooly...

40:15.403 --> 40:18.284
for bravery above and beyond
the call of duty.

40:22.797 --> 40:24.237
It's your papa.

40:25.294 --> 40:28.078
Reminds me of the first time I ever saw you.

40:28.654 --> 40:30.671
It was over 17 years ago.

40:31.535 --> 40:36.048
You walked into my store, not much bigger
than the bundle you were carrying.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.561
And in the bundle
was the most beautiful baby I ever saw.

40:41.329 --> 40:42.866
And was she hungry.

40:44.306 --> 40:47.283
You walked all the way
from Superstition Creek...

40:48.243 --> 40:51.604
just to trade me that medal
for a case of canned milk.

40:53.524 --> 40:56.213
G.W. Was off somewhere, as usual...

40:56.309 --> 40:57.846
fighting Indians.

41:00.246 --> 41:03.127
Sheriff, Sheriff Lord!

41:03.703 --> 41:05.527
Have you seen the Sheriff?

41:05.623 --> 41:08.120
Kind of early for him. Did you try his house?

41:08.216 --> 41:11.577
Why didn't I think of that?
Looks like Birnbaum's is open.

41:11.577 --> 41:13.689
Maybe somebody in here will know.

41:15.802 --> 41:17.530
So there you are, Sheriff.

41:18.298 --> 41:20.795
I told you, you were headed for trouble.

41:21.083 --> 41:22.043
Trouble?

41:22.235 --> 41:25.500
I wanna know by whose authority
you let those Indians stay in town.

41:25.596 --> 41:29.245
Those savages are wards of the government,
and I am the representative...

41:29.341 --> 41:32.798
I told Sheriff Lord that he could put them up
down by the clay slide.

41:33.374 --> 41:36.255
Because the town's named after him,
he thinks he owns it.

41:36.351 --> 41:38.655
You check the books
in the recorder's office...

41:38.655 --> 41:41.344
and you'll find I do own a fair piece of it.

41:41.632 --> 41:44.225
Agard, if you knew anything about Indians...

41:44.321 --> 41:46.529
you'd know that they're doing
their level best...

41:46.625 --> 41:49.986
to put up with
our so-called benevolent patronage...

41:49.986 --> 41:53.443
in spite of the nincompoops
that have been put in charge of it.

41:53.539 --> 41:57.188
Those Indians need my permission
to leave the reservation.

41:57.092 --> 42:00.069
Those Chiefs been giving orders
all their lives.

42:00.165 --> 42:01.701
It's pretty hard for them to understand...

42:01.797 --> 42:05.158
that they have to hold up their hand
like a schoolboy in a classroom.

42:05.254 --> 42:07.174
The law is very clear.

42:07.270 --> 42:10.535
I told you
you'd get no satisfaction from these people.

42:10.631 --> 42:13.224
- We'll get the girl back.
- Girl?

42:13.320 --> 42:16.201
The girl the Indians kidnapped,
but don't worry.

42:16.585 --> 42:20.042
I armed the settlers and set them
to rounding up those red devils.

42:20.330 --> 42:24.267
- What is this about a girl?
- Millie Jones. One of the settler's daughters.

42:24.363 --> 42:26.667
- The Indians kidnapped her.
- That's ridiculous.

42:26.763 --> 42:29.164
And you turned loose a lot of farmers
with shotguns?

42:29.164 --> 42:32.717
- I certainly did.
- You're insane. Let's go, Sheriff.

42:34.349 --> 42:37.038
- Mr. Douglas.
- Mrs. McLintock.

42:37.134 --> 42:40.110
Much as I hate to agree with G.W.
About anything...

42:40.206 --> 42:43.951
you haven't changed a bit.
You're still an hysterical fool.

42:48.945 --> 42:51.249
- Coming to town, I got worried.
- What about?

42:51.345 --> 42:55.378
I thought maybe Katy shot you.
Not yet, Drago, but it took restraint.

42:56.146 --> 42:58.643
Wait a minute, we better take Agard along...

42:58.739 --> 43:02.004
not that he'll be much help.
Drago, help him on the horse.

43:06.997 --> 43:08.437
Just a minute.

43:12.950 --> 43:14.775
- I'll drive.
- Yes, ma'am.

43:16.215 --> 43:18.616
- Agard, what are you doing?
- Scratch him, Agard!

43:18.712 --> 43:21.400
Agard, this is serious. Stay with him, Agard.

43:21.496 --> 43:22.553
Stay with him!

43:24.089 --> 43:28.026
Agard, will you stop showing off
and get in this buggy?

43:28.410 --> 43:29.466
Mercy.

43:31.579 --> 43:32.827
Mercy.

43:33.115 --> 43:35.228
That horse is a little green.

43:41.565 --> 43:42.622
Let's go.

43:50.207 --> 43:52.320
Just where do you think you're going?

43:52.416 --> 43:55.585
Don't use that range-boss tone of voice
with me.

44:04.611 --> 44:05.667
Potter!

44:06.531 --> 44:08.644
Headed for Mr. Pourboire's mine.

44:09.220 --> 44:10.949
Mount up some riders.

44:11.909 --> 44:14.213
Right, Boss. You heard the man.

44:19.303 --> 44:22.375
I don't like it, Mr. McLintock.
I don't like it one bit.

44:22.375 --> 44:25.736
- What don't you like?
- They're planning to hang an Indian.

44:47.149 --> 44:49.934
Sheriff, real funny. Where's the whiskey?

44:51.662 --> 44:52.911
Hold it.

44:54.159 --> 44:56.944
No so fast, Mr. Boss-of-the-Whole-Country...

44:56.944 --> 44:59.632
unless you want to wear a big hole
in your middle.

45:00.112 --> 45:03.569
How long is G.W. Going to let
that Chee-Chalker push him around?

45:04.241 --> 45:06.738
That Chee-Chalker has a sawed-off shotgun.

45:07.506 --> 45:09.619
How do you know
she didn't wander off someplace...

45:09.715 --> 45:11.731
- or meet some fellow or something?
- What are you saying?

45:11.923 --> 45:13.652
That I didn't raise my girl right?

45:13.652 --> 45:15.668
That she'd wander off all night
with some man?

45:15.764 --> 45:18.165
There's a lot of things
I'm not saying to you, mister...

45:18.261 --> 45:20.661
while you've got a sawed-off shotgun
in my middle.

45:20.757 --> 45:23.254
But how do you know this Indian
had anything to do with it?

45:23.350 --> 45:25.751
She's gone, ain't she? She's gone.

45:25.847 --> 45:29.304
Pa, I'm over here.

45:29.496 --> 45:30.744
Pa!

45:33.721 --> 45:36.697
- Been looking for me, Pa?
- Where you been, girl?

45:36.793 --> 45:41.210
Young Ben took me for a sunrise ride,
and the horse wandered away.

45:43.419 --> 45:45.532
- You come down off of there.
- But, Pa.

45:45.724 --> 45:48.508
She's telling the truth, Mr. McLintock.
We weren't doing nothing.

45:48.604 --> 45:49.853
That's not important right now.

45:49.949 --> 45:52.349
The important thing is
that you don't draw that hogleg...

45:52.349 --> 45:54.462
or this'll be worse
than Dodge City on Saturday night.

45:54.654 --> 45:58.111
You get on back to the wagon,
I'll attend to you later.

45:58.783 --> 46:02.240
- Now for this young whippersnapper.
- Now, no harm has been done...

46:02.336 --> 46:05.216
and Young Ben here
is one of the nicest boys in the territory...

46:05.312 --> 46:08.961
- so just put down that shotgun.
- I'll teach him to fool with my...

46:10.402 --> 46:13.282
Now, we'll all calm down.

46:13.474 --> 46:16.067
- Boss, he's just a little excited.
- I know.

46:16.163 --> 46:19.716
I'm gonna use good judgment.
I haven't lost my temper in 40 years.

46:19.812 --> 46:22.212
But, pilgrim,
you caused a lot of trouble this morning.

46:22.405 --> 46:23.653
Might have got somebody killed...

46:23.749 --> 46:27.590
and somebody ought to belt you
in the mouth, but I won't.

46:28.934 --> 46:30.566
The hell I won't.

46:36.520 --> 46:38.536
McLintock riders!

46:48.715 --> 46:49.963
McLin.

46:51.884 --> 46:53.804
Buster, remember me?

47:00.910 --> 47:03.310
Hello, sir. Nice party.

47:12.049 --> 47:14.833
- Do you think you ought to?
- I ought to what?

47:21.843 --> 47:23.475
Why, you fink!

47:46.905 --> 47:48.730
Wait, I want a word with you.

47:48.826 --> 47:52.474
Just a minute.
What are you gonna do... My glasses.

47:52.570 --> 47:54.779
Now, stop this or you'll be sorry.

47:57.372 --> 48:00.540
Oh, for heaven's sake!

48:04.477 --> 48:07.358
- Stay out of this, Jake.
- It's everybody's war!

48:39.334 --> 48:41.158
Where's the whiskey?

48:42.311 --> 48:43.751
Good fight.

48:50.088 --> 48:52.105
Oh, sorry, McLintock.

48:57.290 --> 48:58.731
- McLin.
- Thanks.

49:03.532 --> 49:07.085
- Very funny.
- Yeah, very funny.

49:19.856 --> 49:22.448
Gosh, Mr. Douglas, I'm sorry!

49:26.673 --> 49:28.498
Bon voyage, Drago!

49:46.070 --> 49:47.895
Are you still down here?

49:49.815 --> 49:51.255
Sage, horse wandered away, huh?

49:51.255 --> 49:53.272
Honest, Mr. Jones, honest.

49:57.977 --> 49:59.897
Get out of my way.

50:03.546 --> 50:05.371
- Nice left.
- Thanks.

50:07.099 --> 50:09.980
- But I went to college.
- For this you don't need college.

50:11.132 --> 50:13.149
You're not getting me down there.

50:29.857 --> 50:31.297
You did this on purpose.

50:33.698 --> 50:35.810
Why, McLintock, you big...

50:35.906 --> 50:38.883
- Good morning to you, Mrs. McLintock.
- Bunny, you big...

50:43.204 --> 50:44.068
No!

50:47.621 --> 50:50.982
G. W., because of you
this great, big, clumsy...

50:51.366 --> 50:53.767
Well, it's pretty hard to control yourself.

50:54.151 --> 50:55.303
People!

51:03.273 --> 51:04.521
McLin!

51:06.058 --> 51:10.475
Good party, but no whiskey. We go home.

51:18.445 --> 51:22.574
- You and your friends!
- Well, we at least saved your hat.

51:28.719 --> 51:30.351
Where is everybody?

51:31.600 --> 51:33.136
For heaven's sakes.

51:43.219 --> 51:45.811
Drago, will you never learn
how to handle a team?

51:45.907 --> 51:48.884
Yes, ma'am, I'll sure try.
I'll tell you that, now.

51:50.132 --> 51:53.013
- Crummy family.
- You wanna lose your pigtail?

51:53.205 --> 51:54.453
I lose face.

51:55.029 --> 51:57.910
- Lousy relatives.
- You're gonna lose more than that.

51:58.294 --> 51:59.735
- Kate.
- Yes?

52:00.887 --> 52:03.768
We could be a big help to one another.

52:03.960 --> 52:05.880
Like what, may I ask?

52:06.072 --> 52:08.857
Well, we could wash the mud off
of each other.

52:09.049 --> 52:12.410
We used to have quite good times
doing that sort of thing.

52:13.178 --> 52:17.691
There are a lot of things we used to do.
Good night, Mr. McLintock.

52:26.045 --> 52:29.022
- Any luck?
- What are you talking about?

52:29.118 --> 52:32.863
- I mean, divorce. She still want it?
- Yeah.

52:33.343 --> 52:34.591
You know something? Women are funny.

52:34.687 --> 52:37.280
She fought like a wildcat on your side
out there this afternoon.

52:37.376 --> 52:39.584
Come home,
she slams the door in your face.

52:39.680 --> 52:40.737
That divorce business...

52:40.833 --> 52:44.481
is that what you get when you pay a woman
not to live with you?

52:44.578 --> 52:45.922
That's about it.

52:46.018 --> 52:48.130
With some women I've knowed,
it'd be worth it.

52:49.283 --> 52:51.395
You know, if we had any moral character...

52:51.491 --> 52:54.084
we wouldn't be standing here
covered with mud, drinking...

52:54.180 --> 52:56.965
- when we should be washing.
- G.W.

52:58.213 --> 52:59.269
Drago.

53:03.974 --> 53:05.991
Mrs. Warren, these biscuits...

53:06.663 --> 53:08.199
Thank you, Drago.

53:12.808 --> 53:15.497
- Morning, Mrs. Warren.
- Good morning, Mr. McLintock.

53:15.593 --> 53:17.129
Breakfast for the boss?

53:17.225 --> 53:20.010
If that's the way you want it, Mr. McLintock.

53:58.804 --> 54:03.125
One poached egg,
tea, toast, lightly browned, and...

54:04.277 --> 54:07.830
Why, Mrs. McLintock, you have a black eye.

54:07.926 --> 54:09.174
I do?

54:15.224 --> 54:18.392
- And Becky's coming home today.
- And that's not all.

54:18.584 --> 54:21.273
There's a little something
we'd better get settled.

54:21.945 --> 54:24.922
There are no men listening now,
so we can be ourselves.

54:25.018 --> 54:28.091
Sure, I let you get away with all that guff
the other night...

54:28.187 --> 54:29.915
but now that we're alone...

54:30.011 --> 54:33.660
When I want the opinion of the hired help,
I'll ask for it.

54:34.332 --> 54:37.117
You know,
you could wind up with two black eyes.

54:37.405 --> 54:41.534
- What?
- I realize you had to put on that big act.

54:42.014 --> 54:45.183
We always have to
just before we get ready to forgive them...

54:45.279 --> 54:47.968
generally for something they haven't done.

54:48.352 --> 54:52.001
But you and I both know that's
just to keep them from getting the idea...

54:52.097 --> 54:53.729
they run things.

54:53.825 --> 54:56.802
- McLintock give you that black eye?
- No.

54:57.474 --> 55:00.066
Nobody gave it to me. I won it.

55:07.364 --> 55:10.917
- Morning, Davey.
- Morning, Mrs. Beech, Mr. Beech.

56:05.266 --> 56:08.051
- Why, Miss Becky, welcome home.
- Hello, Mr. Douglas.

56:08.147 --> 56:11.316
Hi, Betty, how are you?
Good to see you again.

56:11.700 --> 56:12.756
Daddy!

56:13.140 --> 56:14.389
Daddy!

56:17.653 --> 56:19.286
It's been two long years.

56:19.382 --> 56:22.166
I guess I'm going to have to stop
calling you Tomboy.

56:22.262 --> 56:24.183
- Becky.
- Mama.

56:24.279 --> 56:28.120
- Mama, I wasn't sure you'd be here.
- I've been here a few days.

56:28.216 --> 56:31.289
Becky, I bought you three of the most
beautiful dresses...

56:31.673 --> 56:33.401
Uncle Drago.

56:34.649 --> 56:36.954
Did you bring your old uncle
a coming-home present?

56:37.050 --> 56:38.682
- Sure did.
- What is it?

56:38.875 --> 56:41.179
A mustache cup. And what did you get me?

56:41.179 --> 56:44.252
The prettiest Palomino pony
that ever packed a saddle.

56:44.252 --> 56:46.940
Broke to stand ground-tied in the county.

56:48.669 --> 56:49.917
Uncle Jake!

56:52.414 --> 56:54.142
What are you doing with Mr. Douglas's tuba?

56:54.142 --> 56:56.063
Mr. Douglas has a fat...

56:56.063 --> 56:57.791
Had a little accident.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.688
I've brought you a whole shipment
of licorice sticks.

57:02.688 --> 57:04.513
But now that I've seen
how much you've grown...

57:04.609 --> 57:07.874
I think we better exchange them
for a couple of bolts of dress goods.

57:07.970 --> 57:11.042
- Thank you.
- The Mayor was gonna be here...

57:11.138 --> 57:14.115
but he had to go up to the territorial capital
on a horse-theft matter...

57:14.307 --> 57:16.036
but I'm gonna give his speech.

57:19.204 --> 57:20.933
And don't worry about the Mayor.

57:21.125 --> 57:24.102
I'm sure that he can find a bill of sale
for the horse.

57:29.383 --> 57:33.128
Ladies and Gentlemen,
we are here to welcome the fairest...

57:34.664 --> 57:36.393
What am I doing?

57:39.177 --> 57:41.002
We are here to welcome back...

57:41.386 --> 57:44.362
the prettiest girl that was ever born
in McLintock...

57:44.458 --> 57:46.475
or in any part of the territory.

57:52.813 --> 57:54.349
- Davey.
- Yeah?

57:54.445 --> 57:56.173
Got something for you.

57:58.286 --> 57:59.726
Yardmaster up at Junction...

57:59.822 --> 58:02.415
told me to let 'em ride,
so I locked 'em in here.

58:02.511 --> 58:04.911
I've had my scalp a long time...

58:05.488 --> 58:07.216
and I aim to keep it.

58:28.821 --> 58:32.566
And now she's come back to us.
Gone are the pigtails...

58:32.662 --> 58:36.983
but the freckles are still on the prettiest face
that was ever born in McLintock.

58:46.970 --> 58:48.218
That's Puma.

58:50.331 --> 58:53.115
Then it's true,
the government did turn them loose.

58:53.211 --> 58:54.748
Good old Puma.

58:55.228 --> 58:58.781
I'll never forget
when he brought G.W. Home.

58:59.741 --> 59:03.678
Your father had a hole in his chest,
and a 104 fever.

59:03.678 --> 59:06.270
Of course,
they weren't very mannerly about it.

59:06.366 --> 59:11.072
He came past the house at a high lope,
and threw him on the doorstep.

59:11.552 --> 59:14.624
Then you do remember them good old days,
don't you, Katy?

59:17.889 --> 59:19.234
Katherine.

59:36.710 --> 59:39.398
- Yatahe my friends.
{y:i}- Yatahe.

59:39.687 --> 59:41.511
Puma, honored enemy.

59:42.951 --> 59:46.120
Does Big McLintock forget?
Also blood brother.

59:46.312 --> 59:48.329
No, I'll never forget that.

59:48.425 --> 59:50.729
Old wound. Does it hurt still?

59:50.921 --> 59:53.226
I feel it when it comes on to rain.

59:53.322 --> 59:55.626
An inch higher
and I wouldn't have had to worry.

59:55.722 --> 59:58.603
Big McLintock, that was remembered fight.

59:59.659 --> 01:00:03.500
We return with news.
Our people have more trouble.

01:00:05.325 --> 01:00:08.013
You see, I learned good English now,
Big McLintock.

01:00:08.398 --> 01:00:10.414
Learned in white man's jail.

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:13.871
But we would have you talk our cause
at Government hearing.

01:00:15.599 --> 01:00:19.440
I understand that Governor Humphrey
is gonna preside at that meeting.

01:00:21.649 --> 01:00:24.049
Yes, Puma, I'll translate your wishes.

01:00:24.145 --> 01:00:25.778
Mr. McLintock...

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:29.523
could I impose on you to use
your Comanche to tell these people...

01:00:29.619 --> 01:00:33.364
Puma is chief of the Comanches
and he speaks English very well.

01:00:35.476 --> 01:00:38.549
Your people will have to follow
my instructions to the letter. It is the law...

01:00:38.645 --> 01:00:39.605
We go.

01:00:41.526 --> 01:00:43.350
Well, now, just a minute.

01:00:46.231 --> 01:00:47.959
For heaven's sakes.

01:01:04.283 --> 01:01:06.588
You wait here, honey, I'll get the buggy.

01:01:08.028 --> 01:01:10.333
- You going to the McLintock party?
- Sure.

01:01:10.525 --> 01:01:11.965
Will I see you there, Beth?

01:01:12.061 --> 01:01:14.174
Of course, Davey,
and you can have the first dance.

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:15.230
Sis.

01:01:16.958 --> 01:01:19.455
I don't want any sister of mine
talking to strangers.

01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:22.239
Davey's not a stranger,
he clerks in Birnbaum's.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.849
He's an Indian.

01:01:33.666 --> 01:01:35.011
Darn you, Drago.

01:01:37.699 --> 01:01:39.428
Now look what you've done.

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:42.596
Baby, this is Devlin Warren,
he works for your papa.

01:01:42.692 --> 01:01:44.997
Dev, this is Miss Becky McLintock.

01:01:45.189 --> 01:01:46.533
Those are my things.

01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:48.166
Yes ma'am.

01:01:48.358 --> 01:01:50.662
I'd have known you anywhere, Miss Becky.

01:01:50.758 --> 01:01:52.199
What do you mean?

01:01:53.639 --> 01:01:56.520
I mean, you look so much
like your mother, even prettier.

01:01:56.616 --> 01:02:00.457
Mr. Warren,
Mother's much prettier than I am.

01:02:00.553 --> 01:02:03.722
Many a fight started with words like that.
Come on, get in the buggy.

01:02:03.818 --> 01:02:04.970
Hello, Ching.

01:02:05.066 --> 01:02:07.947
- We've got cherry pie for dinner?
- I'm not cooking.

01:02:08.235 --> 01:02:09.579
No, he's not.

01:02:09.675 --> 01:02:11.788
- Junior.
- Yes, Miss Becky?

01:02:11.884 --> 01:02:15.532
- You remember Junior Douglas, Mama?
- Of course. How's college?

01:02:15.628 --> 01:02:18.413
- Valedictorian, '95.
- Congratulations.

01:02:18.509 --> 01:02:21.198
Mr. And Mrs. Douglas,
we will see you at the party, of course.

01:02:21.294 --> 01:02:22.830
Delighted.

01:02:23.118 --> 01:02:25.999
Well, it'll be pretty hard
to keep young men away.

01:02:26.191 --> 01:02:28.592
- Drago?
- Yes, Boss. Baggage all loaded.

01:02:28.688 --> 01:02:31.568
G.W. You remember young Junior?

01:02:32.625 --> 01:02:35.025
Yes. Like father, like son.

01:02:35.505 --> 01:02:38.962
Mr. McLintock, I hope you don't think
I'm being presumptuous...

01:02:39.154 --> 01:02:41.843
in asking for the honor
of calling on Miss Rebecca.

01:02:42.899 --> 01:02:46.164
- Well, there she is, ask her yourself.
- Thank you, sir.

01:02:46.356 --> 01:02:48.853
Ching, now I'm gonna get fired.
Giddy up out of here.

01:02:49.045 --> 01:02:50.677
Thank you sir, thank you.

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:57.111
- Have you no manners?
- See you at the party, Junior.

01:02:57.303 --> 01:03:00.183
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what?

01:03:00.279 --> 01:03:02.104
Like father, like son.

01:03:04.504 --> 01:03:06.041
What did he mean, Matthew?

01:03:08.921 --> 01:03:11.610
Come on, Ching, grab a root and growl.

01:03:21.981 --> 01:03:24.285
Well, you're doing a good job,
Miss McLintock.

01:03:24.477 --> 01:03:25.918
Thank you, Mrs. Warren.

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:29.951
Dev, when you're finished there,
go over and help Drago with the beer kegs.

01:03:30.047 --> 01:03:31.295
Yes, Mom.

01:03:33.984 --> 01:03:36.576
Dev, could you come and help me a minute?

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:44.834
I certainly was surprised
to hear you went to college.

01:03:45.026 --> 01:03:47.139
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:03:47.715 --> 01:03:51.460
Junior says Purdue is a good college
for a backwater place like Indiana.

01:03:51.556 --> 01:03:52.708
Well, he did indeed?

01:03:52.804 --> 01:03:54.917
Could you do this? I can't reach it.

01:03:56.933 --> 01:03:59.718
- Why didn't you finish college?
- Lack of funds.

01:04:00.006 --> 01:04:02.502
My father got sick,
and he had to come out West.

01:04:02.983 --> 01:04:04.903
So he took out a homestead.

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:10.184
You know, your mom's sure cute.
It's too bad you didn't inherit her eyes.

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:18.538
You'd have been lucky if you'd inherited
a few things from your father.

01:04:19.307 --> 01:04:21.899
Really? For instance?

01:04:23.148 --> 01:04:25.836
- His common sense, for instance.
- Common sense?

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:29.965
Yeah, you don't see him being fooled
by some dude like Junior Douglas.

01:04:30.061 --> 01:04:33.230
Junior's not a dude. He's nifty.

01:04:33.806 --> 01:04:35.535
This needs a woman's touch.

01:04:35.919 --> 01:04:40.048
- And besides, he got a letter at college.
- What sport?

01:04:40.336 --> 01:04:43.120
- Glee club.
- Very strenuous.

01:04:47.345 --> 01:04:49.170
Don't you dare hug me!

01:04:50.034 --> 01:04:51.762
I have no intention of hugging you.

01:05:38.814 --> 01:05:41.118
The ladies all look lovely, Katherine.

01:05:41.887 --> 01:05:43.423
You know, this is a real fine party.

01:05:43.615 --> 01:05:46.976
Thank you, Ben.
Of course, we had to invite everybody.

01:05:47.552 --> 01:05:49.376
Just everybody.

01:05:51.393 --> 01:05:53.505
Sorry, G. W., this one's mine.

01:05:54.274 --> 01:05:58.019
Thank you, Mrs. Warren. I guess I'll have
to be a good host in my own home.

01:05:58.115 --> 01:06:01.187
- The next one's yours, Mr. McLintock.
- Thank you.

01:06:27.978 --> 01:06:31.051
- Drago, go and do what I told you to do.
- Katy.

01:06:31.147 --> 01:06:33.259
Katherine. And do as you're told.

01:06:33.355 --> 01:06:36.236
Drago, do this. Drago, do that.

01:06:40.845 --> 01:06:42.477
People, people!

01:06:42.669 --> 01:06:44.974
- This Douglas fellow...
- Drago!

01:06:45.646 --> 01:06:46.798
Yes, ma'am.

01:06:46.991 --> 01:06:49.103
Matt Douglas, Jr...

01:06:49.295 --> 01:06:53.040
is going to bring you folks some of
the latest terpsichorean dance steps...

01:06:53.136 --> 01:06:56.785
brand new, brought by him
directly from New York City.

01:06:59.666 --> 01:07:01.106
All right, Mr. Fiddler.

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:44.316
Give me a whiskey.

01:07:45.949 --> 01:07:47.965
- What?
- This turn a 10-gallon party, Boss.

01:07:48.541 --> 01:07:51.614
- We're run out of whiskey.
- I can take care of that, Ching.

01:08:08.898 --> 01:08:09.955
Indian!

01:08:14.468 --> 01:08:17.444
Now, you still got any ideas
about asking my sister to dance...

01:08:17.636 --> 01:08:20.517
- get up and we can do this all over again.
- Yes.

01:08:21.093 --> 01:08:24.645
- That's enough, you've fought it...
- Wuit butting in, Birnbaum.

01:08:24.742 --> 01:08:28.103
- He's a hired man, not your son.
- Look, you fought him fair and square.

01:08:28.198 --> 01:08:30.600
I don't think it was so fair and square.

01:08:31.464 --> 01:08:33.479
What, you want to take up
where he left off?

01:08:33.671 --> 01:08:36.169
If I did, you wouldn't find it so easy.

01:08:40.298 --> 01:08:41.738
Now, we've had enough of this.

01:08:41.834 --> 01:08:43.563
When are you gonna quit walking away?

01:08:43.755 --> 01:08:45.770
Just as soon
as we're out of sight of the party.

01:08:45.962 --> 01:08:48.171
A lesson I learned back home:
Don't fight in front of women.

01:08:48.363 --> 01:08:50.765
- Well, we're out of sight now.
- So we are.

01:09:07.473 --> 01:09:11.314
Such vulgarity.
Someone should do something about it.

01:09:11.986 --> 01:09:13.426
You're right.

01:09:14.578 --> 01:09:16.115
Absolutely right.

01:09:44.921 --> 01:09:46.746
You all right, Young Ben?

01:09:48.091 --> 01:09:49.819
I'm all right, Mr. McLintock.

01:09:50.107 --> 01:09:52.508
Pretty fancy fighting for a country boy.

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:56.349
Two years at Purdue, Mr. McLintock,
on the boxing team.

01:09:56.733 --> 01:09:59.229
I never thought any farmer could whip me.

01:10:00.670 --> 01:10:02.206
But you sure did.

01:10:02.494 --> 01:10:05.183
Better get him cleaned up,
get him some water, Jake.

01:10:23.523 --> 01:10:27.364
Get yourself cleaned up,
go ask that girl for a dance.

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:28.516
Who?

01:10:32.549 --> 01:10:33.510
Oh!

01:10:36.198 --> 01:10:39.367
Where is he? I'll fight him,
that young whippersnapper.

01:10:39.463 --> 01:10:42.056
- Trouble.
- Where is that farmer boy? Where is he?

01:10:42.152 --> 01:10:43.592
Where is he, G. W?

01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:48.489
So you're the young farmer boy
that whipped my nephew.

01:10:48.681 --> 01:10:51.082
I'm Fauntleroy Sage, Young Ben's uncle.

01:10:51.178 --> 01:10:54.539
Well, I'm no farmer, but if you're
Young Ben's uncle, yes, I whipped him.

01:10:54.635 --> 01:10:56.267
And you're intruding.

01:10:56.459 --> 01:10:58.764
- What's intruding mean?
- Butting in.

01:10:59.148 --> 01:11:01.260
So he's insulting me.

01:11:01.356 --> 01:11:03.565
Well, then I got another reason
for walloping him...

01:11:03.661 --> 01:11:06.062
besides on account of him thrashing
my nephew, Young Ben.

01:11:06.158 --> 01:11:09.518
Fauntleroy, you can't get mixed up
in these youngsters' quarrel.

01:11:09.614 --> 01:11:10.767
Family honor.

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:13.263
I can't have it said a farmer
whipped a Sage.

01:11:13.263 --> 01:11:16.816
- You're twice his size.
- Don't let that bother you, Mr. McLintock.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.329
If Mr. Fauntleroy insists,
I'll just have to teach him the same lesson.

01:11:33.716 --> 01:11:34.677
Say!

01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:42.454
Sorry, young fellow.

01:11:45.143 --> 01:11:48.024
Hate to have to do that, young fellow.
No hard feelings.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.368
Not yet.

01:11:50.616 --> 01:11:53.017
- Not yet what?
- I mean, that isn't all.

01:11:53.113 --> 01:11:54.553
Now, wait a minute.

01:11:55.706 --> 01:11:58.586
Fauntleroy, we're gonna make this
a fair fight.

01:11:59.259 --> 01:12:02.619
- Of course we are, G.W.
- There'll be none of this.

01:12:03.388 --> 01:12:05.404
I wouldn't do that, G.W.

01:12:05.596 --> 01:12:08.477
- You wouldn't do...
- I wouldn't do that.

01:12:08.573 --> 01:12:12.126
And Dev, I don't want you kicking Fauntleroy
in the knees.

01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:13.950
He didn't do no such thing.

01:12:14.046 --> 01:12:15.967
And none of this nose twisting.

01:12:17.887 --> 01:12:19.135
He's all yours.

01:12:28.642 --> 01:12:30.370
Where are my glasses?

01:12:30.466 --> 01:12:32.291
You all right, young fellow?

01:12:32.867 --> 01:12:36.324
I'm all right if this Indian agent
will stop stepping all over me.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.684
G. W., you're just funning me.

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:43.237
But I want you to know
that boy fought me a fair fight.

01:12:43.333 --> 01:12:45.350
Well, I'm glad to hear that, Fauntleroy.

01:12:45.446 --> 01:12:46.694
Where's my uncle?

01:12:47.846 --> 01:12:50.055
Fauntleroy, what have you been doing?

01:12:50.151 --> 01:12:53.224
- I hope my uncle didn't bother anybody.
- No bother.

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:57.257
I think we'd better join the ladies
before they get curious. Drago.

01:12:57.737 --> 01:13:00.521
Fauntleroy, let's line them all up
for a do-si-do.

01:13:00.809 --> 01:13:01.866
Jake.

01:13:02.634 --> 01:13:05.131
You think tincture of arnica would help?

01:13:05.995 --> 01:13:08.587
Could be. Used to help you.

01:13:10.604 --> 01:13:12.908
Gentlemen, to the medicine cabinet.

01:13:32.113 --> 01:13:34.034
- Good morning, Drago.
- Morning, baby.

01:13:34.226 --> 01:13:35.186
Have you seen Daddy?

01:13:35.282 --> 01:13:37.490
Took off early this morning
with a scattergun under his arm.

01:13:37.682 --> 01:13:38.739
Went hunting.

01:14:05.337 --> 01:14:07.546
- Morning, Daddy.
- Good afternoon.

01:14:08.122 --> 01:14:09.946
What got you out so early?

01:14:10.426 --> 01:14:12.251
There's something I have to get straight
in my mind.

01:14:12.539 --> 01:14:13.691
Yeah?

01:14:15.036 --> 01:14:15.996
What?

01:14:17.436 --> 01:14:18.396
Mama.

01:14:25.406 --> 01:14:28.095
Why did you and Mama
stop living together, Daddy?

01:14:30.015 --> 01:14:31.456
Why did you separate?

01:14:33.664 --> 01:14:35.585
- Aren't you gonna answer me?
- No.

01:14:36.641 --> 01:14:39.618
- It's sort of my business, I think.
- I don't.

01:14:41.346 --> 01:14:43.939
Is it another woman? It usually is.

01:14:45.091 --> 01:14:47.587
At your age, you always know what's usual.

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:49.124
Is it Mrs. Warren?

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:54.885
Becky, I don't wanna start laying the law
down on your first day back home...

01:14:55.653 --> 01:14:57.670
but I'll have no more such talk.

01:14:57.766 --> 01:15:00.743
The first time I ever saw Mrs. Warren
was last week.

01:15:00.839 --> 01:15:03.143
She has a job here
at which she's very good.

01:15:03.623 --> 01:15:08.232
And I hope you'll have the good manners
to not pry into other people's business...

01:15:10.921 --> 01:15:12.650
your mother's and mine.

01:15:13.418 --> 01:15:15.050
Pretty good shot, Daddy.

01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:17.739
I can understand your trouble.

01:15:17.835 --> 01:15:21.100
Mama's often so, well, so petulant.

01:15:21.676 --> 01:15:22.828
Petulant?

01:15:23.212 --> 01:15:25.517
You've learned a lot of words
back East, Becky.

01:15:25.613 --> 01:15:28.013
I wish to God they'd have taught you
some meanings.

01:15:28.109 --> 01:15:30.606
You were only about six months old...

01:15:30.798 --> 01:15:34.927
when your mother stayed alone with you
in a sod hut under eight foot of snow...

01:15:35.887 --> 01:15:39.440
while I moved the herd 300 miles south
to try and save it.

01:15:39.728 --> 01:15:41.457
Saved about half of it.

01:15:41.553 --> 01:15:45.682
You were a little more than a year old
at the time of the great Comanche raids.

01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:49.907
We stood off 500 Plains Indians
for nine days.

01:15:50.771 --> 01:15:52.115
Petulant, Becky?

01:15:53.075 --> 01:15:54.996
I think you'd better go on home.

01:15:55.188 --> 01:15:57.108
See that Ching gets those birds.

01:16:12.184 --> 01:16:13.240
Becky.

01:16:14.585 --> 01:16:15.737
Come here.

01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:26.972
There's something I ought to tell you.

01:16:27.452 --> 01:16:29.852
Guess now is as good a time as any.

01:16:30.236 --> 01:16:33.405
You're going to have every young buck
west of the Missouri around here...

01:16:33.501 --> 01:16:34.846
trying to marry you.

01:16:35.134 --> 01:16:37.726
Mostly because you're a handsome filly.

01:16:37.822 --> 01:16:41.855
But partly because I own everything
in this country from here to there...

01:16:42.335 --> 01:16:45.984
and they'll think you're going to inherit it.
Well, you're not.

01:16:46.945 --> 01:16:49.249
I'm going to leave most of it to...

01:16:49.825 --> 01:16:52.610
Well, to the nation, really. For a park...

01:16:53.282 --> 01:16:57.987
where no lumberman will cut down
all the trees for houses with leaky roofs.

01:16:58.755 --> 01:17:01.828
Nobody will kill all the beaver
for hats for dudes...

01:17:02.404 --> 01:17:04.517
nor murder the buffalo for robes.

01:17:05.477 --> 01:17:07.013
What I'm going to give you...

01:17:07.109 --> 01:17:09.894
is a 500-cow spread
on the upper Green River.

01:17:10.854 --> 01:17:12.775
That may not seem like much...

01:17:13.351 --> 01:17:16.040
but it's more than we had,
your mother and I.

01:17:17.192 --> 01:17:19.688
Some folks are gonna say
I'm doing all this...

01:17:20.265 --> 01:17:24.586
so I can sit up in the hereafter
and look down on a park named after me...

01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:29.675
or that I was disappointed in you
and didn't want you to get all that money.

01:17:30.155 --> 01:17:33.708
But the real reason, Becky,
is because I love you...

01:17:34.188 --> 01:17:37.933
and I want you and some young man
to have what I had.

01:17:38.797 --> 01:17:41.678
Because all the gold
in the United States Treasury...

01:17:42.638 --> 01:17:44.655
all the harp music in heaven...

01:17:44.847 --> 01:17:47.727
can't equal what happens
between a man and a woman...

01:17:47.823 --> 01:17:49.840
with all that growing together.

01:17:52.721 --> 01:17:55.025
I can't explain it any better than that.

01:18:02.515 --> 01:18:04.051
All right, Daddy.

01:18:06.836 --> 01:18:07.988
Becky.

01:18:12.309 --> 01:18:15.478
When you're as old as I am,
you'll thank me for this.

01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:18.935
Daddy, I'm full grown.

01:18:19.703 --> 01:18:21.720
I wasn't worrying about me...

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:24.888
I was thinking about you and Mama.

01:19:05.986 --> 01:19:09.251
Well, sir, all three of them
fell right out of the carriage.

01:19:12.036 --> 01:19:14.917
Well, it is getting rather late, Becky,
it's bedtime.

01:19:15.109 --> 01:19:16.261
Mother...

01:19:17.221 --> 01:19:19.430
he brought this,
he must have intended to use it.

01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:21.254
- Well...
- Sing us a song.

01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:23.847
Well, if you really want me to.
Gosh, I haven't played in...

01:19:23.943 --> 01:19:26.535
- Do you know Just Right For Me?
- Sure.

01:19:26.631 --> 01:19:28.168
It's the rage now.

01:19:33.353 --> 01:19:35.562
Dev, what're you doing?

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:42.091
I just thought I'd get another cigar.

01:19:42.283 --> 01:19:45.452
You've got one in your mouth,
and two burning in the tray.

01:19:46.508 --> 01:19:47.757
And that move.

01:19:47.853 --> 01:19:49.677
The fellows want me to play all the time.

01:19:51.693 --> 01:19:56.303
{y:i}You're cuter than a baby steer

01:19:56.687 --> 01:20:01.200
{y:i}And softer than a mouse's ear

01:20:01.968 --> 01:20:06.001
{y:i}I want the whole w/de world to hear

01:20:06.577 --> 01:20:10.322
{y:i}You're just r/ght for me

01:20:14.259 --> 01:20:17.044
Not that rhythm, Junior,
do it the way they do it at the Plaza.

01:20:17.044 --> 01:20:19.924
- I know the words.
- Sure, Becky. Will you sing with me?

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.461
- Of course.
- All right.

01:20:27.318 --> 01:20:31.639
{y:i}I love a man who's w/tty and smart
{y:i}and clever

01:20:31.927 --> 01:20:33.368
It's your move.

01:20:37.113 --> 01:20:39.513
Dev, you're playing like an amateur.

01:20:39.993 --> 01:20:43.930
Let's call it an evening.
I'd like to know where your mind is tonight.

01:20:51.516 --> 01:20:54.493
Pretty good, voice like her father.

01:21:01.502 --> 01:21:05.055
{y:i}Sweeter than honey
{y:i}f/ner than w/ne

01:21:05.343 --> 01:21:09.568
{y:i}I'm sure they found you

{y:i}To d/e I/ke th/s
{y:i}/s no d/sgrace

01:21:21.763 --> 01:21:26.469
{y:i}Th/s /s the t/me
{y:i}th/s /s the place for you're

01:21:28.581 --> 01:21:30.598
{y:i}Just r/ght for me

01:21:37.799 --> 01:21:40.584
It's so good, I kind of hate to break this up.

01:21:40.968 --> 01:21:43.753
But if we're gonna have that Indian hearing
tomorrow morning...

01:21:43.849 --> 01:21:46.441
Sir, about our conversation
earlier this evening...

01:21:46.633 --> 01:21:49.322
- I believe I'd better apologize.
- Yeah?

01:21:49.802 --> 01:21:52.875
Yes, sir, I've been thinking it over,
and when I called you a reactionary...

01:21:52.971 --> 01:21:57.292
that's merely my generation's term
for your generation.

01:21:57.772 --> 01:22:00.077
- Nothing personal, sir.
- Really?

01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:04.110
Well, good night, sir.

01:22:04.782 --> 01:22:07.855
- Good night, Mrs. McLintock.
- Good night, and do come again.

01:22:08.911 --> 01:22:10.639
- Good night, Drago.
- Night.

01:22:15.729 --> 01:22:17.361
What's reactionary mean?

01:22:17.649 --> 01:22:18.993
Me, I guess.

01:22:19.569 --> 01:22:23.026
He says that anyone who wanted
to sell at a profit was a reactionary.

01:22:23.122 --> 01:22:26.195
Was we reactionaries back in them days
when you were selling beef cattle...

01:22:26.291 --> 01:22:28.404
for six cents a pound on the hoof?

01:22:28.788 --> 01:22:30.996
No use arguing with him. College boy.

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:47.896
Devlin Warren, if you was my kind of man...

01:22:47.992 --> 01:22:51.161
you wouldn't let some dude walk off
with the prettiest girl west of Denver...

01:22:51.353 --> 01:22:53.370
- without putting up some kind of a fight.
- Does it show?

01:22:53.466 --> 01:22:56.250
What can I do?
I'm just one of her father's employees.

01:22:56.346 --> 01:22:58.075
I'm just a hired hand around here.

01:22:58.267 --> 01:22:59.995
Every so often, Dev...

01:23:00.571 --> 01:23:03.164
you spill the strangest ideas.

01:23:04.604 --> 01:23:06.525
Everybody works for somebody.

01:23:06.525 --> 01:23:09.214
Me, I work for everybody
in these United States...

01:23:09.406 --> 01:23:11.998
that steps into a butcher's shop
for a T-bone steak.

01:23:12.094 --> 01:23:14.975
And you work for me.
There's not much difference.

01:23:16.607 --> 01:23:19.104
Daddy, the most terrible thing
just happened.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.753
Junior's horse ran away,
the one he rented at the livery stable.

01:23:22.849 --> 01:23:26.210
You tied up a rented horse by the reins?
He's probably back in the stall by now.

01:23:26.402 --> 01:23:29.474
I think we can get Junior something
that he can ride.

01:23:29.571 --> 01:23:32.931
What I'd rather do, Daddy,
is drive Junior home in our barouche.

01:23:33.027 --> 01:23:36.676
It's a lovely evening, and I'm sure
Uncle Drago wouldn't mind driving.

01:23:36.772 --> 01:23:41.189
I would, and I got the kind of manners don't
keep me from saying so, just to be polite.

01:23:41.285 --> 01:23:43.206
I'll drive him home, Mr. McLintock.

01:23:43.302 --> 01:23:46.567
You don't have to come, Miss Becky.
I'll see that he gets home safely.

01:23:46.663 --> 01:23:49.927
- I can take care of myself.
- You got yourself afoot, didn't you?

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:53.384
- Dev, get the carriage. Drago.
- I'm going with them.

01:23:53.576 --> 01:23:55.785
Now you got me wrangling dudes.

01:24:09.612 --> 01:24:13.837
{y:i}You make a man feel I/ke a k/ng

01:24:14.125 --> 01:24:17.006
{y:i}You're just r/ght for me

01:24:17.582 --> 01:24:20.367
Miss Becky?
Somebody better help me watch the road.

01:24:20.463 --> 01:24:23.824
You know, I'm new around here,
and I might take the wrong turnoff.

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.857
Devlin Warren, you know there isn't
a turnoff between here and town.

01:24:27.953 --> 01:24:31.602
{y:i}You d/sappear w/thout a trace

01:24:32.082 --> 01:24:35.827
{y:i}To d/e I/ke th/s
{y:i}/s no d/sgrace

01:24:36.019 --> 01:24:40.244
{y:i}Th/s /s the t/me
{y:i}Th/s /s the place

01:24:43.605 --> 01:24:46.197
Devlin Warren, what are you trying to do?
Kill us?

01:24:46.293 --> 01:24:48.790
Would you rather have your friend drive?

01:25:03.289 --> 01:25:04.826
Daddy.

01:25:04.922 --> 01:25:07.514
I have never been so humiliated
in my entire life.

01:25:07.610 --> 01:25:10.491
I said what I said,
and I'll stand by it to the death.

01:25:10.779 --> 01:25:13.180
Shoot him, Daddy, shoot him at once.

01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:16.925
- Why?
- My honor is at stake.

01:25:17.213 --> 01:25:19.421
- Well, now, your honor?
- Absolutely.

01:25:19.421 --> 01:25:22.686
- He impugned my honor.
- Impugned? What does that mean?

01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:26.239
- Slander. He slandered my honor.
- He did?

01:25:26.335 --> 01:25:29.024
I said what I said,
and I'll stand by it to the death.

01:25:29.024 --> 01:25:30.944
He admits it, see? Shoot him.

01:25:31.136 --> 01:25:34.113
- Well, what is he admitting to?
- Why, he called me a...

01:25:34.305 --> 01:25:35.745
I won't even repeat the word.

01:25:35.745 --> 01:25:37.570
I didn't necessarily call you anything...

01:25:37.666 --> 01:25:40.258
but I said what I said,
and I'll stand by it to the death.

01:25:40.354 --> 01:25:43.235
Just for the tally books, what did you say?

01:25:43.331 --> 01:25:45.636
I said that any girl
who'd permit a man to kiss her...

01:25:45.732 --> 01:25:48.228
before they're formally engaged is a trollop.

01:25:48.324 --> 01:25:50.149
He said it again. Shoot him!

01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:52.453
- Now, hold on.
- No, don't hold on.

01:25:52.645 --> 01:25:55.622
If you're my father, if you love me,
you'll shoot him.

01:25:56.198 --> 01:25:59.367
Well, I'm your father and I sure love you...

01:25:59.559 --> 01:26:00.711
so...

01:26:02.632 --> 01:26:05.608
You shot him. You really shot him.

01:26:05.705 --> 01:26:06.857
If he dies...

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:10.314
If he dies, he'll be the first man ever killed
with a blank cartridge.

01:26:10.410 --> 01:26:12.906
We use this to start the races on the Fourth.

01:26:14.443 --> 01:26:15.787
I'm on fire here.

01:26:15.883 --> 01:26:18.764
- You poor dear.
- Poor dear?

01:26:18.764 --> 01:26:22.124
- You'd have had me shot in cold blood.
- But it didn't happen.

01:26:22.221 --> 01:26:25.101
Yelling I insulted you and all,
what you need is a good spanking.

01:26:25.197 --> 01:26:26.638
Dev! Daddy.

01:26:27.118 --> 01:26:28.654
Leave me out of this.

01:26:29.230 --> 01:26:32.303
- I think I'll give you what you deserve.
- You wouldn't dare.

01:26:32.399 --> 01:26:33.455
Wouldn't I?

01:26:33.647 --> 01:26:36.144
You'll think next time
before you have someone shot...

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:38.160
and this kicking and yelling ain't gonna help.

01:26:38.256 --> 01:26:40.177
Don't! Daddy, what...

01:26:42.866 --> 01:26:45.842
Daddy, help me. Don't.

01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:49.587
Devlin Warren, I hate you!

01:26:50.547 --> 01:26:52.948
Mommy! Mommy!

01:26:53.716 --> 01:26:55.541
G. W., was that a shot?

01:27:02.934 --> 01:27:05.527
- Becky, what happened?
- He spanked me.

01:27:07.928 --> 01:27:10.040
You spanked my daughter?

01:27:10.328 --> 01:27:11.288
Dev.

01:27:13.113 --> 01:27:16.762
You mean, you stood there
while that brute beat our daughter?

01:27:16.954 --> 01:27:18.778
G. W., what's happened to you
in the last three...

01:27:18.874 --> 01:27:20.027
Better part of valor, son.

01:27:20.027 --> 01:27:22.523
Isn't it enough that you've always
treated me like a squaw...

01:27:22.523 --> 01:27:25.692
without subjecting dear, sweet Becky
to this crude, vulgar...

01:27:25.884 --> 01:27:28.669
Katherine, you women are always
raising hell about one thing...

01:27:28.765 --> 01:27:31.261
when it's something else
you're really sore about.

01:27:31.357 --> 01:27:33.278
Don't you think it's about time
you told me...

01:27:33.374 --> 01:27:36.159
what put the burr under your saddle
about me?

01:27:36.255 --> 01:27:39.711
I don't intend to stand here
and hold a midnight conversation...

01:27:39.903 --> 01:27:41.920
with an intoxicated man.

01:27:50.562 --> 01:27:53.059
And I am not intoxicated...

01:27:56.804 --> 01:27:57.764
yet.

01:28:04.677 --> 01:28:07.078
- Hello, Governor.
- Hello, Governor.

01:28:25.995 --> 01:28:28.299
- Chief Puma.
- Yes, Sergeant.

01:28:29.067 --> 01:28:32.908
Big McLintock,
we know you'll get us fair judgment.

01:28:33.388 --> 01:28:35.213
You gentlemen, follow me.

01:28:40.206 --> 01:28:42.895
- Well, Jake?
- G.W.

01:28:49.136 --> 01:28:53.457
- Well, G. W., it's been a long time.
- Not long enough, Cuthbert.

01:28:55.954 --> 01:28:59.699
- Your husband is a rude man.
- Yes, Cuthbert, I know.

01:29:12.566 --> 01:29:14.775
Where do you want the Indians,
Mr. McLintock?

01:29:14.775 --> 01:29:16.887
Mr. McLintock is not running this hearing.

01:29:18.231 --> 01:29:20.440
- Sergeant, seat those Indians.
- Yes, sir.

01:29:20.632 --> 01:29:22.264
Gentlemen, be seated.

01:29:24.089 --> 01:29:26.777
You know, their whole tribe here wanted
to come into town.

01:29:26.873 --> 01:29:28.410
Proceed, Lieutenant.

01:29:30.426 --> 01:29:32.059
This hearing is now in session.

01:29:32.155 --> 01:29:34.363
Governor Cuthbert Humphrey presiding.

01:29:34.555 --> 01:29:35.900
Good luck, Daddy.

01:29:36.188 --> 01:29:38.204
I'm afraid it's a packed court.

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:40.029
Government Edict number 826.

01:29:40.893 --> 01:29:43.293
As ordered that the Comanche nation
be transferred...

01:29:43.389 --> 01:29:46.078
from their present reservation to Fort Sill...

01:29:46.174 --> 01:29:49.727
it is the government's claim
as filed by Indian agent Agard...

01:29:51.359 --> 01:29:55.296
that these chiefs after being released
from prison by a kindly government...

01:29:55.392 --> 01:29:59.617
did then rouse and incite defiance
among the tribe against said order.

01:30:01.058 --> 01:30:04.611
It seems, gentlemen, that although
some of these chiefs speak English...

01:30:04.707 --> 01:30:07.395
Chief Puma is quite at home
in our language...

01:30:07.779 --> 01:30:10.948
they have chosen Mr. McLintock
to be their spokesman.

01:30:11.428 --> 01:30:15.557
I speak for the Comanche,
or rather, I offer this translation.

01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:18.054
Proceed, Mr. McLintock.

01:30:25.064 --> 01:30:26.600
The Comanches say:

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:30.441
We are an old people, and a proud people.

01:30:30.921 --> 01:30:32.842
When the white man first came among us...

01:30:32.938 --> 01:30:35.818
we were as many as the grasses
of the prairie.

01:30:36.682 --> 01:30:39.851
Now we are few, but we are still proud...

01:30:40.523 --> 01:30:43.692
for if a man loses pride in manhood,
he is nothing.

01:30:44.652 --> 01:30:47.437
You tell us now
that if we will let you send us away...

01:30:47.533 --> 01:30:49.742
to this place called Fort Sill...

01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:52.334
you will feed us and care for us.

01:30:53.102 --> 01:30:54.543
Let us tell you this:

01:30:55.311 --> 01:30:57.808
It is a Comanche law
that no chief ever eats...

01:30:57.904 --> 01:31:00.976
unless first he sees
that the pots are full of meat...

01:31:01.072 --> 01:31:03.569
in the lodges of the widows and orphans.

01:31:03.665 --> 01:31:05.874
It is the Comanche way of life.

01:31:06.834 --> 01:31:11.635
This that the white man calls charity
is a fine thing for widows and orphans...

01:31:12.403 --> 01:31:16.532
but no warrior can accept it,
for if he does, he is no longer a man...

01:31:16.724 --> 01:31:19.413
and when he is no longer a man
he is nothing...

01:31:19.797 --> 01:31:21.237
and better off dead.

01:31:21.333 --> 01:31:25.366
You say to the Comanche, 'You are widows
and orphans, you are not men. '

01:31:25.846 --> 01:31:28.631
And we, the Comanche, say
we would rather be dead.

01:31:28.823 --> 01:31:31.800
It will not be a remembered fight
when you kill us...

01:31:31.896 --> 01:31:34.585
because we are few now
and have few weapons.

01:31:35.353 --> 01:31:38.906
But we will fight
and we will die Comanche.

01:31:42.939 --> 01:31:44.763
Thank you, Big McLintock.

01:31:45.339 --> 01:31:49.468
Am I to gather the Comanche
defy the government of the United States?

01:31:49.564 --> 01:31:53.981
Yes, you may gather that the Comanche
defy the United States government.

01:31:54.173 --> 01:31:56.670
- Or at least this commission.
- Gentlemen.

01:32:05.312 --> 01:32:08.481
It is the order of this court
that these chiefs be incarcerated...

01:32:08.577 --> 01:32:12.706
until such time as the detachment of the
United States Cavalry be made available...

01:32:12.802 --> 01:32:15.875
to escort them
and the Comanche nation to Fort Sill.

01:32:17.795 --> 01:32:19.619
This court is adjourned.

01:32:22.788 --> 01:32:24.133
McLintock.

01:32:24.421 --> 01:32:27.013
You are an important chief
amongst these white people.

01:32:27.109 --> 01:32:28.262
Sway them.

01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:31.814
Have them give us a few guns
to make the fight worthwhile.

01:32:32.103 --> 01:32:35.559
Let us have one last remembered fight
for end of Comanche.

01:32:35.943 --> 01:32:38.632
I almost wish I could arrange that, Puma.

01:32:45.354 --> 01:32:47.178
- Sergeant.
- Yes?

01:32:47.178 --> 01:32:49.099
Left guard, carry on.

01:32:49.483 --> 01:32:50.635
Gentlemen.

01:32:59.373 --> 01:33:01.294
It's sad, these changing times.

01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:05.039
It isn't the times that are changing, Mama.

01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:29.909
Hi, G.W.

01:33:30.005 --> 01:33:30.965
Hello, Lem.

01:33:46.617 --> 01:33:47.673
Bunny.

01:33:49.305 --> 01:33:50.842
Howdy, McLintock.

01:33:51.802 --> 01:33:53.914
Figured you'd be belly-down drunk by now.

01:33:54.106 --> 01:33:56.891
I've been doing
some thinking-drinking, Bunny.

01:33:57.371 --> 01:33:59.484
Is that box car still on the siding?

01:33:59.484 --> 01:34:01.404
- Sure, but...
- But what?

01:34:01.596 --> 01:34:03.709
- I don't like it.
- You don't?

01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:07.454
You figure them Indians get out of there and
lead the Cavalry on a wild goose chase...

01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:11.103
- that Great White Father's gonna get nosey...
- Get nosey and he'll investigate.

01:34:11.103 --> 01:34:15.328
And when they find out how that side-
saddle governor's been messing things up...

01:34:15.424 --> 01:34:17.344
they'll give those Indians a fair trial.

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.457
But that's live ammunition in that boxcar.

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:22.241
You know what'll happen if them Indians
get some guns in their hands?

01:34:22.433 --> 01:34:23.298
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

01:34:23.778 --> 01:34:26.274
- Is Puma's word good enough for you?
- Well, I don't...

01:34:27.619 --> 01:34:29.539
McLintock, you got yourself a partner.

01:34:29.635 --> 01:34:31.075
Leave me out of this.

01:34:31.556 --> 01:34:32.612
McLintock.

01:34:35.781 --> 01:34:37.221
Good night, Bunny.

01:34:39.622 --> 01:34:41.350
Good night, Governor.

01:34:45.287 --> 01:34:47.399
{y:i}Where /s the Katy

01:34:47.495 --> 01:34:51.336
{y:i}W/th her I/ght red ha/r?

01:34:52.681 --> 01:34:54.985
{y:i}Sweet as the roses

01:34:55.177 --> 01:34:57.962
{y:i}On the summer a/r

01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:00.843
{y:i}I'll f/nd her somewhere

01:35:00.939 --> 01:35:04.588
{y:i}Wh/le the moon /s h/gh

01:35:04.684 --> 01:35:07.852
{y:i}And tell her that I love her

01:35:08.141 --> 01:35:11.501
{y:i}And I'll love her t/ll I d/e

01:35:11.597 --> 01:35:12.654
Katy!

01:35:13.422 --> 01:35:17.839
Katy Gilhooly. The master's home.

01:35:22.448 --> 01:35:25.425
Katherine Gilhooly McLintock.

01:35:25.809 --> 01:35:27.729
Where is the woman of the house?

01:35:28.209 --> 01:35:29.554
Mr. McLintock.

01:35:30.802 --> 01:35:32.146
There you are.

01:35:33.011 --> 01:35:36.275
Mrs. Warren, good evening.

01:35:37.044 --> 01:35:40.116
- I waited up for you, Mr. McLintock.
- How nice.

01:35:40.692 --> 01:35:43.573
- I want to talk to you about something.
- Delighted.

01:35:44.725 --> 01:35:48.470
- Three hundred and nine times straight.
- I beg your pardon?

01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:52.791
Three hundred and nine times straight
without a miss. Gotta be a record.

01:35:53.079 --> 01:35:55.672
I suppose so. Now, Mr. McLintock,
what I wanted to say...

01:35:55.768 --> 01:35:58.265
Two-pound Stetson with a six-inch brim...

01:35:58.649 --> 01:36:01.818
53 feet in the air, it's gotta be a record.

01:36:02.010 --> 01:36:04.218
I'm sure it is, but the reason I waited up...

01:36:04.314 --> 01:36:07.291
Dangnabbit, woman,
can't you hold that glass still?

01:36:07.579 --> 01:36:08.923
Of course, sir.

01:36:10.556 --> 01:36:13.148
Down the hatch to my world record.

01:36:15.549 --> 01:36:16.989
Down the hatch.

01:36:17.757 --> 01:36:18.910
Yes, sir.

01:36:25.055 --> 01:36:28.320
Now, to the Governor of our territory.

01:36:29.184 --> 01:36:31.201
The Governor of the territory, sir?

01:36:31.297 --> 01:36:33.985
Now, don't you stick up for him,
Mrs. Warren.

01:36:34.177 --> 01:36:35.906
You're a fine woman, Mrs. Warren.

01:36:36.098 --> 01:36:38.595
But you'll certainly go down
in my estimation...

01:36:38.691 --> 01:36:42.531
if you stick up for Cuthbert H. Humphrey,
Governor of this territory.

01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:45.412
- I don't mean to change...
- Down the hatch.

01:36:46.084 --> 01:36:48.293
Yes, sir. Down the hatch.

01:36:51.654 --> 01:36:55.111
Cuthbert H. Humphrey,
Governor of our territory...

01:36:55.303 --> 01:36:56.743
is a cull.

01:36:57.223 --> 01:36:59.047
Do you know what a cull is, ma'am?

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:03.561
A cull is a specimen that is so worthless...

01:37:03.849 --> 01:37:05.673
that you have to cut him out of the herd.

01:37:05.769 --> 01:37:09.226
Now, if all the people in the world
were put in one herd...

01:37:09.706 --> 01:37:12.011
Cuthbert is the one
I would throw my rope at.

01:37:12.587 --> 01:37:15.467
At whom I would throw my rope at.

01:37:16.428 --> 01:37:17.964
Natural-born cull.

01:37:18.444 --> 01:37:21.613
- Another touch, ma'am?
- No, sir, no.

01:37:25.934 --> 01:37:28.239
- I don't mind if I do.
- Good.

01:37:28.527 --> 01:37:29.967
Can't walk on one leg...

01:37:30.063 --> 01:37:33.808
I didn't mean to be vulgar ma'am.
Can't walk on one limb.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.248
It's all right.

01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:38.705
It sounds silly,
only a bird can walk on a limb.

01:37:39.569 --> 01:37:41.778
You know my wife? Her name's Kate.

01:37:42.066 --> 01:37:44.851
She insists on being called Katherine.
Do you know her?

01:37:44.947 --> 01:37:47.539
Of course, Mr. McLintock,
and that's what I wanted...

01:37:47.731 --> 01:37:50.996
Well, she thinks
that Cuthbert H. Humphrey...

01:37:51.188 --> 01:37:55.029
is panting for her like a bull buffalo
at the first greenup of spring.

01:37:55.701 --> 01:37:58.678
But what Cuthbert is panting for
is my money.

01:38:00.598 --> 01:38:03.287
Don't make me feel
like I'm drinking alone, ma'am.

01:38:03.383 --> 01:38:06.648
Very well, Mr. McLintock, if you insist.

01:38:07.704 --> 01:38:10.489
- Down the hatch.
- Good.

01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:24.700
Mr. McLintock...

01:38:25.949 --> 01:38:28.637
I have something very important
to say to you.

01:38:30.366 --> 01:38:31.710
Very important.

01:38:34.207 --> 01:38:36.703
I guess it'll have to wait till the morning.

01:38:37.567 --> 01:38:38.720
Toodle.

01:38:39.968 --> 01:38:41.600
It's all right.

01:38:43.041 --> 01:38:44.481
Beddy bye-bye.

01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:58.212
Mrs. Warren, let me assist you.

01:38:58.885 --> 01:39:00.133
Very kind.

01:39:23.371 --> 01:39:25.195
What's going on here?

01:39:25.675 --> 01:39:28.940
Now, Katherine, are you going to believe
what you see...

01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:30.572
or what I tell you?

01:39:34.509 --> 01:39:37.966
Mrs. McLintock,
hope you won't misunderstand.

01:39:38.542 --> 01:39:41.903
It's the first 100 women sitting on his lap
that I misunderstood...

01:39:41.999 --> 01:39:44.496
number 101 is quite simple.

01:39:44.592 --> 01:39:46.608
Now, G.W. McLintock...

01:39:48.721 --> 01:39:50.353
He's gone to sleep.

01:39:51.217 --> 01:39:54.194
Just when I know
exactly what I want to say to him...

01:39:54.290 --> 01:39:56.019
he goes to sleep.

01:39:57.747 --> 01:40:01.204
I waited up to talk to Mr. McLintock...

01:40:02.548 --> 01:40:04.469
I wanted to tell him I was quitting.

01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:08.694
You see, Sheriff Lord
has asked me to marry him and...

01:40:09.846 --> 01:40:11.382
Congratulations.

01:40:12.150 --> 01:40:15.991
I don't want to seem prudish,
but if you are going to marry Sheriff Lord...

01:40:16.087 --> 01:40:19.160
it seems to me
that you're sitting on the wrong man's lap.

01:40:23.481 --> 01:40:27.802
Come on, I'll help you upstairs, and we'll
have a long talk about men in general.

01:40:30.587 --> 01:40:34.332
Ladies, one moment.

01:40:44.894 --> 01:40:47.487
Watch out, you'll get us all killed!

01:40:54.497 --> 01:40:57.089
Wait a minute, ladies,
till I catch my breath...

01:40:57.089 --> 01:40:59.490
and I'll get you up those stairs...

01:40:59.586 --> 01:41:04.291
as sure as my name
is George Washington McLintock...

01:41:17.446 --> 01:41:19.943
- You may be quitting, Mrs. Wallace...
- Mrs. Warren.

01:41:20.039 --> 01:41:21.287
...but not tomorrow.

01:41:21.383 --> 01:41:23.784
I want my breakfast in bed, I want...

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:26.088
I know, toast, lightly browned...

01:41:26.185 --> 01:41:28.681
Somebody sure put a knob on my skull.

01:41:29.065 --> 01:41:32.138
- It was Katy. I was peeking.
- Katy? Why?

01:41:32.906 --> 01:41:35.019
Mrs. Warren was there...

01:41:36.171 --> 01:41:39.820
and you was there,
and the whiskey bottle was there...

01:41:39.916 --> 01:41:43.469
and Katy's temper being
what Katy's temper is, well, there you are.

01:41:43.853 --> 01:41:45.581
Drago, old friend.

01:41:46.253 --> 01:41:48.174
My wife does not understand me.

01:41:48.270 --> 01:41:50.286
Why should she be any different
than the others?

01:41:50.382 --> 01:41:52.207
Come on, I gotta get you upstairs.

01:41:52.303 --> 01:41:54.319
Get you ready
for that big celebration tomorrow.

01:42:02.001 --> 01:42:05.746
Drago, I am sleeping in the den.

01:42:23.703 --> 01:42:25.911
Ain't you got no respect for your elders?

01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:41.371
Scallywags! Villains!
Hope you get the measles.

01:42:46.556 --> 01:42:48.188
Come on, get him aboard.

01:42:48.381 --> 01:42:49.725
Is everybody ready?

01:42:50.109 --> 01:42:52.510
The man at number five needs a flagstick.

01:42:52.606 --> 01:42:53.854
Get him one.

01:42:55.966 --> 01:42:57.695
Let us know when you're ready.

01:42:57.983 --> 01:43:00.768
{y:i}Lad/es and gentlemen...

01:43:01.056 --> 01:43:04.128
{y:i}/t /s my honor to present to you...

01:43:04.416 --> 01:43:07.105
{y:i}the Governor of our terr/tory:

01:43:07.681 --> 01:43:10.754
{y:i}Cuthbert H. Humphrey.

01:43:11.426 --> 01:43:12.770
{y:i}Thank you Mayor.

01:43:14.787 --> 01:43:18.724
My friends and citizens
of this great territory...

01:43:19.108 --> 01:43:21.413
this is the ninth consecutive year...

01:43:22.085 --> 01:43:25.638
it has been my privilege and my pleasure...

01:43:25.734 --> 01:43:29.767
to inaugurate
the McLintock Fourth of July celebration.

01:43:30.631 --> 01:43:33.511
Now, the first event
will be the wild horse race.

01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:37.544
But before I fire this shot
to start the event...

01:43:38.025 --> 01:43:40.809
I would like to say a few modest words...

01:43:41.097 --> 01:43:45.322
regarding my stewardship
of this great territory.

01:44:29.973 --> 01:44:32.374
- All right, Professor Birnbaum.
- Gentlemen.

01:44:35.831 --> 01:44:37.175
Sheriff, there's your horse.

01:44:37.271 --> 01:44:39.384
Come on, get them all lined up.
Come here, Ching.

01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:41.784
Now, boys, you all know the rules.

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:44.569
It's twice around the inside
and once around the outside.

01:44:44.665 --> 01:44:48.602
The first cowboy that hits that finish line
without busting that egg is the winner.

01:44:48.698 --> 01:44:51.386
And, I caution you boys
about some of them eggs...

01:44:51.482 --> 01:44:54.459
'cause some of them eggs
are last year's holdovers.

01:44:57.916 --> 01:44:59.548
{y:i}All r/ght mount up.

01:45:21.634 --> 01:45:24.515
Katherine, my dear,
you seem to be enjoying yourself.

01:45:24.611 --> 01:45:26.723
Yes. This is wonderful.

01:45:26.819 --> 01:45:29.508
It's the only thing I really do enjoy
about this barbaric country.

01:45:29.604 --> 01:45:31.524
The Fourth of July celebration.

01:45:33.925 --> 01:45:36.902
Katherine, I've been here for three days
and I haven't heard from you.

01:45:36.998 --> 01:45:38.630
- Is anything wrong?
- Wrong?

01:45:38.918 --> 01:45:42.855
I just hope that it hasn't been necessary
for you to say anything...

01:45:43.143 --> 01:45:44.487
to G.W.

01:45:46.216 --> 01:45:48.328
What are you talking about?

01:45:49.769 --> 01:45:53.225
Katherine, you see,
I'm in a rather delicate position...

01:45:53.418 --> 01:45:55.434
being Governor of the territory and all.

01:45:55.530 --> 01:45:59.083
I just hope you haven't found it necessary
to say anything about...

01:45:59.563 --> 01:46:00.715
About what?

01:46:01.868 --> 01:46:03.500
About you and me.

01:46:09.838 --> 01:46:13.294
Why, you pompous windbag.

01:46:13.967 --> 01:46:17.615
Do you think that you're the only man
who's tried to play patty fingers with me...

01:46:17.711 --> 01:46:19.920
who's ever tried to lure me
into the moonlight?

01:46:20.016 --> 01:46:20.976
Well, no, but I...

01:46:21.072 --> 01:46:23.665
Well, I'm a big girl
and I can take care of myself.

01:46:23.761 --> 01:46:25.105
My husband knows it.

01:46:25.297 --> 01:46:29.138
I can assure you, Governor,
that your reputation is untarnished.

01:46:29.234 --> 01:46:31.635
Now, get out of my way.

01:46:52.664 --> 01:46:55.929
We got ourselves a winner. Curly Fletcher.

01:46:56.409 --> 01:46:58.041
Fine old job, Curly.

01:46:59.962 --> 01:47:01.306
Give me the egg.

01:47:03.899 --> 01:47:05.435
Disqualified.

01:47:07.932 --> 01:47:09.564
Here you go, Curly.

01:47:11.773 --> 01:47:14.173
G. W., you'll never believe
what happened over...

01:47:14.269 --> 01:47:15.325
What?

01:47:15.614 --> 01:47:19.358
- You smell of beer.
- Naturally, I'm drinking beer.

01:47:20.319 --> 01:47:21.855
{y:i}Lad/es and gentlemen...

01:47:22.431 --> 01:47:24.736
{y:i}the next event w/ll be a contest...

01:47:24.928 --> 01:47:29.441
{y:i}between the two
{y:i}bronco-bust/ng champ/ons...

01:47:29.537 --> 01:47:30.977
{y:i}of our terr/tory.

01:47:31.073 --> 01:47:33.282
Remember the year I rode in that event?

01:47:33.282 --> 01:47:35.682
I wore your garters to hold up my sleeves.

01:47:36.355 --> 01:47:38.275
We had a bet, and I won it.

01:47:39.715 --> 01:47:43.268
George Washington McLintock,
you are a very crude man.

01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:47.493
I guess so, but that was a rough horse,
liked to have jarred my insides loose.

01:47:47.973 --> 01:47:49.606
But it was worth it.

01:47:53.543 --> 01:47:55.367
Three beers.

01:48:21.582 --> 01:48:25.423
One, two, three, go!

01:48:58.647 --> 01:49:01.143
- Dev, are you all right?
- I guess so.

01:49:01.335 --> 01:49:03.352
Nothing busted but my pride.

01:49:03.448 --> 01:49:05.560
That ought to even things up, farmer.

01:49:05.656 --> 01:49:06.713
For what?

01:49:06.809 --> 01:49:09.209
For that sore nose you gave me
the other day.

01:49:09.305 --> 01:49:11.706
Well, that ain't what's sore on him.

01:49:29.086 --> 01:49:32.639
{y:i}The clos/ng event /s the cow pony race.

01:49:32.831 --> 01:49:35.808
{y:i}The f/n/sh I/ne /s at the barbecue...

01:49:35.808 --> 01:49:38.112
so start meandering.

01:49:38.976 --> 01:49:40.129
Come on.

01:49:41.665 --> 01:49:44.450
Now, what is that? False courage?

01:49:45.602 --> 01:49:48.867
Why, you know a Douglas doesn't ever use
a thing like that.

01:49:49.347 --> 01:49:53.092
I want you to get on that horse,
get out in front, and stay out in front.

01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:55.204
I'll be out front, Dad.

01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:58.181
- All the way.
- Good boy.

01:49:58.757 --> 01:50:02.406
Now, remember, stay out in front,
that Agamemnon's a good horse.

01:50:06.823 --> 01:50:08.168
Whoa, Agamemnon.

01:50:13.065 --> 01:50:15.081
The 11:40, and she's on time.

01:50:36.783 --> 01:50:38.127
Come on, boy.

01:51:42.078 --> 01:51:44.959
Big party. Where's the whiskey?

01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:50.913
- Whose idea was this stunt?
- Duck, doggone it, them are real bullets.

01:52:30.186 --> 01:52:33.355
I'm thinking that's about all the excitement
you'd want for one Fourth of July.

01:52:33.451 --> 01:52:34.795
Puma finally got his way.

01:52:34.891 --> 01:52:36.908
But I reckon he's riding out
his last war party.

01:52:36.908 --> 01:52:38.636
They won't get very far.

01:52:38.732 --> 01:52:42.093
But one thing still has me puzzled.
Where did they get the guns?

01:52:42.285 --> 01:52:44.398
I was wondering the same thing.

01:52:45.742 --> 01:52:48.142
- My kidney's been bothering me, and...
- Bunny.

01:52:49.583 --> 01:52:50.735
G.W.

01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:57.073
What an idiotic joke.

01:52:57.169 --> 01:52:59.761
- Joke? You think that was a joke?
- Well, shut up.

01:52:59.857 --> 01:53:03.410
- Do you want everybody in town to see me?
- You look good in feathers.

01:53:07.635 --> 01:53:10.804
- Dev, I think they've gone.
- Yeah.

01:53:10.996 --> 01:53:12.532
Well, what are you going to do about it?

01:53:12.628 --> 01:53:14.453
- What can I do?
- Nothing!

01:53:14.741 --> 01:53:16.757
Just like you've always done.

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:29.240
How long, G. W?

01:53:29.913 --> 01:53:31.545
- How long what?
- Katherine.

01:53:31.545 --> 01:53:34.330
She's been riding herd on you
for two years now.

01:53:34.522 --> 01:53:35.770
I'm a peaceable man...

01:53:35.770 --> 01:53:39.419
but my father used to say, you raise
your voice, it doesn't do any good.

01:53:39.515 --> 01:53:40.859
It's time to raise your hand.

01:53:40.955 --> 01:53:43.644
Well, I've been planning to do something
about it.

01:53:44.508 --> 01:53:47.101
- I'll have another talk with her.
- Talk to her?

01:53:47.773 --> 01:53:50.558
Talk to her? Talking won't do any good!

01:53:53.726 --> 01:53:55.455
Becky, have you seen your...

01:53:55.935 --> 01:53:58.240
What's been happening around here?

01:53:59.296 --> 01:54:01.216
You've got hay all over you.

01:54:01.408 --> 01:54:05.537
Been some mighty sneaky goings-on here
during that raid, Mr. McLintock.

01:54:06.786 --> 01:54:09.570
Who was it who said
only a trollop would kiss a man...

01:54:09.666 --> 01:54:11.203
before they were formally engaged?

01:54:11.299 --> 01:54:13.315
- But, we are engaged, sir.
- You are?

01:54:13.411 --> 01:54:15.236
That is, with your permission.

01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:18.981
Well, you've got it. Mrs. Warren?

01:54:19.845 --> 01:54:21.573
I think it's wonderful.

01:54:23.494 --> 01:54:27.815
I guess this is the only engagement
that ever started off of a spanking.

01:54:31.752 --> 01:54:33.672
I reckon Birnbaum was right.

01:54:37.033 --> 01:54:38.281
All right.

01:54:40.682 --> 01:54:43.659
Lord bless us. This is gonna be a great day.

01:54:43.851 --> 01:54:45.099
Doggone it, folks.

01:54:45.195 --> 01:54:49.420
Let's don't let a little old Indian raid
break up a good barbeque and a rodeo.

01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:53.069
- The meat's on!
- Let's go.

01:54:53.549 --> 01:54:56.430
You contestants get ready
for the cow pony race.

01:55:00.847 --> 01:55:03.151
- Who is it?
- It's me, let me in.

01:55:04.208 --> 01:55:05.264
Not now.

01:55:06.128 --> 01:55:07.088
Right now.

01:55:07.376 --> 01:55:09.969
- Are you insane?
- I want to talk to you.

01:55:10.737 --> 01:55:12.274
It'll have to wait.

01:55:14.002 --> 01:55:14.866
G.W.!

01:55:15.058 --> 01:55:18.035
- I've taken all I'm gonna take from you.
- You are insane.

01:55:18.227 --> 01:55:21.588
You're going to tell me why you packed up,
picked up, and walked out on me.

01:55:21.684 --> 01:55:24.469
Two years ago, you remember,
you came home from Denver...

01:55:24.565 --> 01:55:26.389
with lipstick all over your...

01:55:31.958 --> 01:55:33.879
Lipstick on my collar.

01:55:37.048 --> 01:55:39.736
- I've got the shirt to prove it.
- Who cares?

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.233
Why, you big...

01:56:00.861 --> 01:56:02.206
Katherine.

01:56:06.431 --> 01:56:08.735
G. W., you are a ruffian.

01:56:09.215 --> 01:56:11.424
Cuthbert, you are right.

01:56:20.258 --> 01:56:22.659
Well, what kind of a family is that?

01:56:24.291 --> 01:56:25.539
The best.

01:56:25.827 --> 01:56:27.172
And dangerous, fellow.

01:56:30.917 --> 01:56:32.453
Who won the race?

01:56:33.125 --> 01:56:35.910
Who cares, Agard? History's being made.

01:56:54.250 --> 01:56:55.307
Yes, Rufus?

01:56:55.403 --> 01:56:58.667
I regret to inform you
I've changed my mind about matrimony.

01:57:00.396 --> 01:57:01.932
Rufus!

01:57:19.697 --> 01:57:21.137
Mrs. McLintock!

01:57:34.772 --> 01:57:36.117
Katherine!

01:57:36.405 --> 01:57:39.765
- Keep them out of here.
- Everybody, out!

01:58:03.387 --> 01:58:05.788
Looks like G.W.'s buying out
the whole store.

01:58:05.884 --> 01:58:07.516
I'm afraid you're right.

01:58:14.238 --> 01:58:16.542
Crummy family.

01:58:30.370 --> 01:58:31.330
G.W.

01:58:38.340 --> 01:58:40.452
G.W.!

01:58:53.703 --> 01:58:57.256
- Mrs. McLintock, you're all wet.
- Am I?

01:59:06.186 --> 01:59:07.723
Wrong woman, G.W.

01:59:08.491 --> 01:59:09.643
Pardon me.

01:59:28.272 --> 01:59:30.864
Mrs. McLintock, you setting a new style?

01:59:49.781 --> 01:59:52.854
Mr. McLintock, in here!

02:00:15.035 --> 02:00:19.356
If I ever get through this humiliation,
you'll rue the day you ever met me.

02:00:19.452 --> 02:00:22.141
Bellyache and fight all you want,
it won't do you any good.

02:00:22.237 --> 02:00:25.022
You've been digging those spurs into me
for two years...

02:00:25.118 --> 02:00:27.710
now you're gonna get your comeuppance.

02:00:28.094 --> 02:00:29.055
Thanks.

02:00:31.551 --> 02:00:33.952
My father would be proud of you.

02:00:34.144 --> 02:00:35.872
I'll make him prouder.

02:00:41.058 --> 02:00:42.210
Stop it!

02:00:45.763 --> 02:00:47.587
Keep it, you may need it.

02:00:48.163 --> 02:00:49.892
Now get your divorce.

02:00:53.157 --> 02:00:55.845
- Home. Don't spare the horse.
- Home? But...

02:00:56.229 --> 02:00:57.093
You heard me.

02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:59.878
Don't think you're gonna get rid of me
that easy.

02:01:22.924 --> 02:01:25.228
- No more living in the capital?
- No.

02:01:25.324 --> 02:01:28.013
- No more Newport in season?
- Nope.

02:01:28.205 --> 02:01:32.238
- No more dancing at the Governor's ball?
- No, G.W.

02:01:32.430 --> 02:01:33.870
Happy days.

02:01:36.079 --> 02:01:39.152
Three hundred and ten times
without a miss...

02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:41.936
that's a record.
