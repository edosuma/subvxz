01:04.982 --> 01:09.944
Ji-won?

01:56.158 --> 01:57.992
Wake up! Wake up!

01:58.285 --> 02:00.161
Wake up, sleepy head!

02:00.537 --> 02:02.413
Time to wake up!

02:02.790 --> 02:04.540
Wake up! Wake up!

02:04.833 --> 02:06.626
Wake up, sleepy head!

02:06.835 --> 02:08.753
You klutz.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.923
That felt like an earthquake.

02:14.468 --> 02:18.012
What...

02:20.182 --> 02:23.059
Damn, period!

02:24.394 --> 02:26.938
Not on the last day of exams!

02:27.147 --> 02:30.191
That's a lot of blood.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.278
Got any pads?

02:35.113 --> 02:42.703
DEATH BELL

02:51.839 --> 02:54.507
Come here!
Your skirt's too short!

02:55.133 --> 02:56.968
And you!

02:58.720 --> 03:01.931
What are you listening to?

03:01.932 --> 03:06.060
Today's the last day
of our midterms.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.521
Good luck, everyone.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.647
Morning.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.277
That stinks!

03:14.278 --> 03:15.027
Say...

03:15.904 --> 03:17.780
How much did you drink?

03:17.781 --> 03:20.283
A lot thanks to you, Mr. Kim.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.327
You left me hanging.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.081
I stayed up reviewing
the exam questions.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.458
I got tired.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.963
You really go overboard
with exams.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.465
Just copy other peoples' tests.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.719
Student rankings change
over 1 point.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.013
We should make them carefully.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.181
Morning, Ms. Choi.

03:45.517 --> 03:46.642
Good morning.

03:51.315 --> 03:54.191
Never saw her laugh, once.

03:58.655 --> 03:59.530
Okay, mom.

04:00.073 --> 04:00.823
Yes...

04:01.533 --> 04:02.867
Don't worry.

04:03.702 --> 04:04.535
Okay.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.913
I promise...

04:07.372 --> 04:09.081
Can't you take that outside?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.167
Gotta go, mom.

04:13.837 --> 04:14.837
Here.

04:17.549 --> 04:19.759
Mind your own bees-wax.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.303
You're not the only one here.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.931
Stop being a bother
and take it outside.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.059
Mom...mom...
What a little child...

04:28.060 --> 04:30.519
Just because you don't have a mom!

04:33.774 --> 04:34.941
What did you say?

04:35.525 --> 04:36.776
Hey, Ina!

04:37.486 --> 04:39.278
Quiet down, will you?

04:41.782 --> 04:43.199
I see...

04:43.659 --> 04:47.036
Rich PTA members' kids
stick together, huh?

04:49.206 --> 04:52.833
Teachers may be your puppets
but you can't always have your way!

04:53.085 --> 04:55.878
I'll tell the teachers exactly that.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.088
Do so.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.632
Aren't you telling
the PTA president, too?

05:00.592 --> 05:02.843
You can run to Kang-hyun, then.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.110
Sorry, this is mine.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.612
Good day, sir.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.075
How'd you do?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.995
I'm not ready for the last test.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.038
I'm screwed

05:43.844 --> 05:44.885
What're you looking at?

05:46.304 --> 05:47.972
Loser.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.964
If you don't want to take it,
get out.

06:23.759 --> 06:25.843
Keep writing!

06:26.386 --> 06:27.720
Thank you, Ms. Choi.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.097
Sit back down!

06:30.474 --> 06:31.849
Remember.

06:32.517 --> 06:35.352
Life's full of tests.

06:41.151 --> 06:45.279
Help me...

07:01.630 --> 07:02.755
What's wrong?

07:02.756 --> 07:03.964
Are you okay?

07:04.299 --> 07:05.216
There is...

07:05.634 --> 07:07.426
Something’s on the test paper....

07:16.978 --> 07:18.687
You’re just nervous.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.815
Take it sIow.
Get up.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.405
What’s this?

07:30.742 --> 07:32.493
I didn’t do this.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.621
It was her.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.081
She did it.

07:41.837 --> 07:44.505
10 minutes left.
Wrap it up.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.305
Hey! Sit down!

07:54.558 --> 07:55.599
Keep writing.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.520
The bell went off early.
Keep writing.

08:00.605 --> 08:04.150
Reputable foreign language High

08:04.401 --> 08:08.028
Let me brag
about our school...

08:08.029 --> 08:11.115
Stop laughing and
write your tests.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.242
Be quiet!

08:15.453 --> 08:19.290
Lousy Chang-in High,

08:19.291 --> 08:22.877
with way too many tests!

08:22.878 --> 08:26.922
The stench of the devil’s mouth,

08:26.923 --> 08:30.426
Chang-in!
- Kang!

08:31.678 --> 08:33.762
If you don’t want to study,
stay low till graduation!

08:33.930 --> 08:35.848
You little troublemaker!

08:36.433 --> 08:38.809
Apologize for what you did!

08:39.144 --> 08:41.937
- What proof?
- Mister Lee!

08:42.647 --> 08:44.481
Let’s not get too excited.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.150
I'll handle this.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.778
Kang-hyun? Was it you?

08:49.988 --> 08:51.947
Why would I do such a thing?

08:53.617 --> 08:55.826
If I was your homeroom teacher,
you'd be dead!

08:55.827 --> 08:57.119
I’m watching you, Kang!

08:57.412 --> 08:58.454
Here.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.041
What is it?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.126
You like music, right?

09:05.879 --> 09:08.923
Well, if you really insist.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.885
I put my new song on there, too.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.220
What!

09:14.429 --> 09:16.305
Don’t be so soft on him.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.349
Making a crappy song like that...

09:18.767 --> 09:21.393
He’s right, isn't he?

09:21.603 --> 09:25.147
Always wanting to be in
with the kids.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.733
Your class average is down,
because you are so strict.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.945
- What!
- Hold on, you two!

09:31.446 --> 09:34.365
Why are you the ones fighting?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.409
Have a seat everyone.

09:44.376 --> 09:48.295
Students from our sister school,
Eaton,

09:48.755 --> 09:50.714
will be coming in 10 days.

09:50.966 --> 09:52.132
Yes.

09:52.133 --> 09:55.177
ls the Korean teacher in charge?

09:55.428 --> 09:57.680
Yes, sir. I am.

09:57.681 --> 10:01.976
Please make a temporary class
with our top students.

10:02.477 --> 10:06.063
And start training them
from this weekend.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.524
This weekend?

10:08.817 --> 10:11.944
But they just finished their exams...

10:12.570 --> 10:14.822
- Ms. Choi?
- Yes?

10:14.823 --> 10:16.865
How is the English demo class coming?

10:17.075 --> 10:18.701
Doing the best I can, sir.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.120
Who's head of student patrol?

10:21.871 --> 10:25.082
- Me, sir.
- What happened?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.016
- Myung-ho?
- Yes?

10:42.225 --> 10:44.059
Can you help me with this?

10:44.060 --> 10:45.853
Hurry!

10:51.234 --> 10:52.359
Ready?

10:52.360 --> 10:54.737
One, two, three!

10:55.947 --> 10:58.240
How’d you do on the test?

11:00.243 --> 11:02.995
I think I did well.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.581
Maybe it's because of the dream.

11:06.541 --> 11:07.666
What dream?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.586
I dreamt I slept
with Won Bin.

11:10.962 --> 11:14.131
Crazy!
Why would he sleep with you!

11:14.132 --> 11:16.091
It's just a dream.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.510
No way!
Even if it’s just a dream...

11:18.678 --> 11:20.512
Bin is mine!

11:21.848 --> 11:25.601
He held me so tight...

11:26.936 --> 11:28.687
It felt like we were really doing it!

11:28.688 --> 11:30.564
Why? You!

11:30.940 --> 11:33.025
Bin...

11:33.818 --> 11:35.611
I will kill you!

11:35.612 --> 11:37.988
- Bin...
- I'll teach you!

11:40.450 --> 11:42.826
So, this is the girls’
dorm rooftop?

11:46.664 --> 11:48.082
Nice.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.837
Go before the dorm teacher
gets here!

11:58.718 --> 12:01.136
Only if you come to the club.

12:05.016 --> 12:08.060
Go party yourself!

12:10.146 --> 12:13.357
You'd better come,
or I'll kidnap you!

12:14.067 --> 12:16.193
You know I’ll do it.

12:18.029 --> 12:21.407
Try it and you're dead.

12:22.325 --> 12:23.450
Get lost.

12:24.119 --> 12:25.953
Let’s go, Myung-ho.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.371
Okay...

12:29.249 --> 12:31.750
I hope he kidnaps us...

12:32.043 --> 12:34.461
Oh, please.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.005
-Why? He is cute!
Friday, May 23rd.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.007
1 day before the special class.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.531
1st: Min Hye-young

13:02.532 --> 13:04.199
1st: Kim Ji-won

13:43.198 --> 13:45.324
You freak!

13:57.462 --> 13:59.254
Are you okay, Ina?

14:01.925 --> 14:04.301
Sick bastard...

14:06.221 --> 14:08.972
Everything’s in English.

14:10.016 --> 14:14.561
You have a lot of smart kids
in your class.

14:16.439 --> 14:19.358
It’s because my kids all work hard.

14:20.485 --> 14:21.985
Whatever, man.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.029
Sir! It's Cho Beom!

14:26.741 --> 14:28.909
Something’s wrong with him!

14:29.786 --> 14:31.161
You’re all dead!

14:31.162 --> 14:34.122
You’re dead!

14:34.123 --> 14:35.457
You’ll die!

14:42.966 --> 14:44.800
Go back in, now.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.927
But ma'am,

14:46.928 --> 14:49.805
he’s not well.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.558
Can’t we hospitalize him

14:52.559 --> 14:54.434
after Eaton’s visit?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.980
I think it’s best
to hospitalize him, now.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.941
- He just got a little stressed...
- I am sorry.

15:01.693 --> 15:04.695
He’s out of the special class.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.239
Take care, ma’am.

15:11.828 --> 15:15.330
Everyone’s gone,
but we’re stuck here.

15:15.957 --> 15:17.958
What are you saying?

15:17.959 --> 15:20.168
It's an honour to be school reps,
isn’t it?

15:20.336 --> 15:23.088
I like it. It’s nice and quiet.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.050
Ina?

15:28.094 --> 15:29.928
Do you want go to the club tonight?

15:32.098 --> 15:34.224
You like that fool that much?

15:36.019 --> 15:37.728
Then go and tell him!

16:13.514 --> 16:14.306
Hello?

16:15.600 --> 16:16.767
Is someone there?

16:20.229 --> 16:22.356
What are you doing here?

16:26.319 --> 16:28.945
What are you looking at?

17:25.670 --> 17:30.257
Saturday, May 24th.
Start of a special class.

17:40.977 --> 17:44.396
This is a special class.
Do we have to?

17:44.647 --> 17:47.315
Devil's breath toId me to.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.488
Go put the phones away.

17:53.656 --> 17:54.614
Yes, sir.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.993
Sick of studying, right?

17:58.161 --> 17:59.077
No.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.080
But be proud.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.331
Only the elites are here.

18:03.666 --> 18:04.624
Yes.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.669
- Who's missing?
- Hye-young’s not here, yet.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.296
I didn’t see her all morning.

18:09.464 --> 18:10.756
She’ll come.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.593
Let’s show what we got!

18:14.802 --> 18:16.136
- Yes!
- All right!

18:20.349 --> 18:24.102
Dong-hyuk...

18:49.629 --> 18:50.962
Why are you here?

18:50.963 --> 18:52.672
Mr. Kim told me to come.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.925
There you are.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.137
Morning, sir.
What do l have to do?

19:00.306 --> 19:02.265
You've studied abroad, right?

19:02.517 --> 19:03.391
Yes.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.601
You did?

19:05.478 --> 19:07.479
You should thank your parents.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.732
- Sending a fool like you abroad...
- Mr. Lee!

19:10.733 --> 19:12.108
Stop it.

19:17.365 --> 19:20.367
This is all in English.
Can you organize it?

19:20.618 --> 19:22.953
- Sure.
- Sit there.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.335
Stop watching that.

19:57.071 --> 19:57.988
Quiet!

19:58.865 --> 20:01.074
We’ll start off by
watching a DVD.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.159
It’ll be in English.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.309
Help me!

20:28.728 --> 20:32.981
Help me...

20:34.817 --> 20:36.276
Isn’t that Hye-young?

20:37.820 --> 20:39.237
It’s Hye-young!

20:39.238 --> 20:41.406
What’s she doing in there?

20:44.035 --> 20:45.702
She's in a cage!

21:00.134 --> 21:02.677
It's Hye-young...

21:05.056 --> 21:06.765
What’s she doing in there?

21:06.766 --> 21:08.934
Go to the staff room, now.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.750
Why isn’t the Internet working?

21:35.586 --> 21:36.586
What the?

21:41.342 --> 21:42.926
The internet’s not working, Mr. Lee.

21:42.927 --> 21:45.887
- A double! Incredible!
- Stop watching that!

21:46.931 --> 21:48.556
Why isn’t this working?

21:50.142 --> 21:52.852
M. Kim, where is the remote?

21:56.732 --> 21:57.607
What?

21:57.984 --> 21:59.067
What is going on?

21:59.819 --> 22:01.569
That’s Hye-young.

22:02.238 --> 22:02.988
What?

22:04.365 --> 22:05.407
Hye-young?

22:08.744 --> 22:10.745
Be quiet!

22:10.997 --> 22:14.457
You will be taking
another test.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.795
- What the hell?
- If you don't answer...

22:18.963 --> 22:20.797
- Quiet!
- you will die one by one...

22:20.798 --> 22:24.217
Who's pulling pranks again!

22:24.218 --> 22:26.219
- Shut up!
- With smart students here,

22:26.387 --> 22:28.346
I'm sure you'll do well.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.348
- Whose voice is that?
- Listen.

22:30.349 --> 22:34.519
The questions
should be easy for you.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.605
If you go outside the school,
you'll die...

22:37.606 --> 22:39.566
Remember.
Don’t try to leave the school.

22:40.401 --> 22:44.112
You must solve all questions

22:44.113 --> 22:46.114
to get the full answer.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.410
Now, let's begin.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.706
The first question has been given.

22:55.416 --> 23:00.545
If you can't answer it,
this girl will die...

23:04.383 --> 23:05.759
Oh, no...

23:07.219 --> 23:08.344
Sir?

23:09.013 --> 23:10.472
Glad, you came here.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.974
The phone’s cut off

23:12.975 --> 23:14.684
What? Check yours.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.897
My cell phone’s not working either.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.441
- No signal.
- My cell phone...

23:22.902 --> 23:25.070
Cell phone?
Dong-hyuk collected all of them.

23:25.863 --> 23:29.157
What is that?

23:29.158 --> 23:30.950
How would we know!

23:31.660 --> 23:34.120
The call button on my cell is broken!

23:34.121 --> 23:35.789
Check if yours works.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.334
Help me!

23:41.712 --> 23:43.505
Hye-young!

23:44.882 --> 23:46.633
- Lee!
- What?

23:46.634 --> 23:48.802
- Go to the PA room, now!
- Okay.

23:55.059 --> 23:56.392
Sir...

23:56.393 --> 23:58.895
Can you find a way
to contact the cops?

23:58.896 --> 23:59.729
Sure.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.981
The water’s coming up!

24:06.445 --> 24:08.530
Let's go to the classroom, now.

24:27.341 --> 24:28.758
Why isn't it turning off!

24:33.430 --> 24:35.181
Mr. Kim!

24:36.767 --> 24:37.976
It’s okay.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.769
Is everyone else okay?

24:39.770 --> 24:41.020
Dong-hyuk’s missing.

24:41.021 --> 24:43.064
You started class without him?

24:43.065 --> 24:44.649
During class,

24:44.859 --> 24:46.693
I can't go looking for a kid.

24:46.694 --> 24:49.237
I can't leave my pupils!

24:50.114 --> 24:51.489
Where is he?

24:51.657 --> 24:52.949
Why, you little!

24:55.369 --> 24:57.537
- What did you do?
- What?

24:57.538 --> 24:59.122
- I’ll teach you...
- M. Lee...

25:04.128 --> 25:05.879
You have no proof!

25:05.880 --> 25:08.423
You want proof?

25:08.424 --> 25:10.550
After what you pulled yesterday!

25:10.551 --> 25:12.260
Calm down, Mr. Lee!

25:12.261 --> 25:14.679
You're the only one,

25:14.680 --> 25:16.306
who’d go this far!

25:16.307 --> 25:19.934
Please! Hyun would never do
something like this!

25:23.606 --> 25:25.565
You and Ina did this,
didn't you!

25:25.733 --> 25:27.817
You want to die, shithead?

25:27.818 --> 25:30.486
Hyun! Watch your language!

25:30.696 --> 25:32.614
- Why you little!
- I didn't do it!

25:32.865 --> 25:33.990
I didn’t do it!

25:34.575 --> 25:37.535
The hell, you didn't!
Turn that off, now!

25:37.536 --> 25:40.121
Calm down, Mr. Lee!

25:40.331 --> 25:42.123
How can I?

26:03.729 --> 26:05.063
Back to your seats.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.440
Sit down!

26:11.028 --> 26:18.201
10:44 AM. Min Hye-young, dead.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.043
What should we do?

26:27.378 --> 26:28.753
I’ll go out.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.047
There’s a phone in the store
across the street.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.215
I will call the police.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.967
He said not to go out.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.843
Don't go. It’s dangerous.

26:36.053 --> 26:37.595
I’ll try my luck.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.264
We can't just stay here like this!

26:41.892 --> 26:43.268
I'll be right back.

26:43.477 --> 26:46.145
Mr. Lee!

26:46.355 --> 26:49.482
Shit! I'm going, too!

26:49.483 --> 26:50.900
No, Jae-wook!

26:51.777 --> 26:54.195
I’m getting out, sir.

26:54.989 --> 26:58.157
- I told you to stay seated.
- I’m getting out.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.618
Sit down!

27:02.162 --> 27:03.246
Sit!

27:03.622 --> 27:04.706
Sit down!

27:06.333 --> 27:07.292
Get them!

27:09.253 --> 27:10.295
Sit down!

27:10.296 --> 27:11.504
Quiet!

27:12.464 --> 27:13.464
Assis, j’ai dit!

27:17.845 --> 27:18.761
Sit down!

27:19.471 --> 27:22.557
You're the elites!
Listen to your teachers!

27:23.183 --> 27:24.892
We want to live!

27:58.385 --> 28:00.386
Mr. Lee! Come on!

28:00.387 --> 28:02.263
Don’t die on me!

28:02.431 --> 28:03.931
Get up!

28:04.850 --> 28:05.975
Lee!

28:09.355 --> 28:12.523
Don’t die!

28:14.610 --> 28:16.819
Answer the question.

28:17.446 --> 28:20.865
Then you'll know
why you're taking this test.

28:21.992 --> 28:23.826
I’ll remind you, again.

28:24.787 --> 28:26.621
Do not try to leave the school.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.333
Now, for the second question.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.502
A listening comprehension question.

28:33.587 --> 28:36.297
You will only hear it once.

28:36.548 --> 28:39.509
Be very careful.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.803
Listen and answer.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.564
Who are you?

28:53.565 --> 28:55.942
I am Sohn Dong-hyuk,

28:56.735 --> 28:58.945
a grade 12 student at Chang-in High.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.116
Why do you think you are here?

29:09.873 --> 29:11.457
I did something bad!

29:11.458 --> 29:13.042
What did you do?

29:15.295 --> 29:17.255
Where did your sin

29:17.256 --> 29:19.090
come from?
Is it your fault?

29:20.050 --> 29:21.592
My mom...

29:22.302 --> 29:24.804
She was too greedy.
I'm sorry.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.681
Please, don't kill me!

29:26.682 --> 29:29.684
Go to the auditorium and
find the Chinese words related to...

29:29.893 --> 29:32.270
the sin and greed he mentioned.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.604
PIease find a way

29:34.231 --> 29:37.400
to contact someone.

29:37.401 --> 29:39.110
I’ll do what I can!

30:02.426 --> 30:03.759
Greed...

30:04.136 --> 30:05.928
The answer goes up there.

30:07.598 --> 30:10.558
He said his mom was greedy.
What does that mean?

30:10.559 --> 30:12.643
Any ideas?

30:12.644 --> 30:14.437
Did you find it?

30:14.438 --> 30:17.273
Hold on! I'm thinking.

30:18.692 --> 30:20.276
Hot! It's hot!

30:28.202 --> 30:29.327
It’s hot!

30:40.797 --> 30:42.757
It’s hurting me!

30:45.802 --> 30:47.678
'Too much is bad".

30:48.388 --> 30:49.847
That’s only 4 words.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.559
'Loves son too much"?

30:54.603 --> 30:55.895
Lao-tzu?

30:56.563 --> 30:57.688
Yes!

30:57.689 --> 31:00.316
Mom being greedy means

31:00.317 --> 31:03.027
she was unsatisfied with his grades.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.488
But we need eight words.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.866
'Be satisfied and stop,

31:09.660 --> 31:11.035
then...

31:11.453 --> 31:12.828
no dangers await".

31:13.205 --> 31:14.872
That’s it!

31:15.123 --> 31:18.125
Right! That’s eight words!

31:20.796 --> 31:23.881
'Be satisfied and stop,
then no dangers await'!

31:35.519 --> 31:38.396
Find them! Hurry!

31:41.400 --> 31:45.361
There's not much time!
Ina! The other one!

31:45.612 --> 31:46.821
Yes! Bring it over!

31:47.990 --> 31:49.532
This one, yes!

31:50.200 --> 31:51.659
Hurry!

31:52.494 --> 31:53.619
Over there...

31:54.162 --> 31:56.163
Another one!

31:59.918 --> 32:02.461
1:40 PM Second question.
Sohn Dong-hyuk, dead.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.984
Who’s the son of a bitch
doing this?

32:36.121 --> 32:39.332
Ms. Choi,
Jae-wook is missing.

32:39.708 --> 32:40.583
What?

32:41.043 --> 32:42.168
Missing?

32:49.635 --> 32:50.551
Myung-ho.

32:51.261 --> 32:52.803
Stay right here.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.019
Where are you going?

33:00.479 --> 33:01.646
Ina!

33:04.941 --> 33:07.276
- l’ll go with her.
- Kang Hyun!

33:12.491 --> 33:13.491
What is it?

33:15.827 --> 33:17.161
Just as I expected.

33:18.205 --> 33:20.164
They’re being killed
by the ranking.

33:22.292 --> 33:23.626
What?

33:24.336 --> 33:27.004
Look. Hye-young placed 1st.

33:28.090 --> 33:31.467
Dong-hyuk was 2nd...
and now, Jae-wook is missing.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.012
Myung-ho placed 4th.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.015
Then it’s me.

33:38.934 --> 33:40.768
The answer's written on the body.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.021
What?

33:44.606 --> 33:46.649
The answer's on his body.

33:56.993 --> 33:59.537
The answer was written
on Dong-hyuks body.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.497
Let’s run to the dorm together.

34:01.665 --> 34:05.000
- Think it's safe there?
- I don’t know...

34:05.502 --> 34:07.962
lf we hide, they'll take
the other kids.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.965
Then why not all stay here, together?

34:10.966 --> 34:11.882
Stupid!

34:13.301 --> 34:16.262
We are, but they still took
Jae-wook!

34:16.930 --> 34:19.140
They’re putting

34:19.516 --> 34:21.976
questions and answers
on the bodies.

34:22.978 --> 34:26.188
If we hide,
at least we won’t get killed.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.818
Though I feel bad for
the remaining kids here.

34:32.779 --> 34:33.988
Soo-jin?

34:38.285 --> 34:40.536
Can I go, too?

34:42.289 --> 34:44.915
I can't take this.
Let’s go find Jae-wook.

34:45.959 --> 34:47.501
He could be anywhere.

34:47.669 --> 34:49.170
We can't just stay here
and do nothing!

34:49.337 --> 34:51.505
At least no one will get killed.

34:51.715 --> 34:53.549
And it's okay for Jae-wook
to get killed?

34:53.800 --> 34:56.469
You know, that's not
what l meant.

34:56.636 --> 34:57.845
Forget it.

34:59.473 --> 35:00.514
Sir?

35:00.974 --> 35:03.684
May we go to the bathroom?

35:04.352 --> 35:06.896
Stay together and hurry!

35:11.443 --> 35:13.277
Hey, let me go.

35:14.488 --> 35:18.032
I’ll protect you, Ina.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.701
As for Myung-ho,
it’s an option.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.872
Protect yourself.

35:34.925 --> 35:36.509
I'm scared! Hurry!

35:38.637 --> 35:40.721
There’s a key here,
somewhere.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.223
Why’s the CCTV on?

35:42.224 --> 35:45.726
- It's still on?
- Forget it and hurry up!

36:07.624 --> 36:09.792
- You sure no one’s here?
- Be quiet!

36:09.793 --> 36:11.085
What if someone comes?

36:20.178 --> 36:22.805
Hey! Wait up!

36:36.152 --> 36:39.280
Myung-ho?

36:41.741 --> 36:43.492
Where’s Myung-ho?

36:44.327 --> 36:46.745
She went to the washroom.
Why? What’s wrong?

36:46.746 --> 36:48.080
Yes, why?

36:48.081 --> 36:49.915
They’re being killed by
the ranking.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.042
Myung-ho’s...

36:52.544 --> 36:53.669
...next!

36:54.296 --> 36:55.754
Gather around, kids!

36:57.340 --> 36:58.257
Hurry!

37:03.972 --> 37:06.140
We're splitting into two groups.

37:07.809 --> 37:09.560
Smells so girlie in here.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.904
See?
I told you we’d be safe, here.

37:20.864 --> 37:22.489
I was wondering...

37:23.408 --> 37:25.200
Can the boys and girIs stay

37:25.452 --> 37:27.745
in different rooms?

37:28.955 --> 37:31.916
I want to change clothes.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.877
Don't you get it, stupid?

37:35.503 --> 37:38.088
We have to stick together!

37:38.715 --> 37:41.008
Turn around, boys!

37:41.217 --> 37:43.385
- Just change. Who cares?
- Why you...

37:43.386 --> 37:44.303
Stupid!

37:45.764 --> 37:46.847
Forget it then.

37:46.848 --> 37:49.725
Just change.
I saw you wet your pants.

37:49.726 --> 37:50.684
No, I didn’t.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.395
Where do we sit, Soo-jin?

37:54.230 --> 37:55.773
Anywhere!

37:56.399 --> 37:58.150
- What about us?
- The floor.

38:21.675 --> 38:22.675
Be careful!

38:26.054 --> 38:27.429
What are you doing?

38:29.307 --> 38:30.808
Looking for a cell phone.

38:33.186 --> 38:34.770
Don’t go off on your own.

38:35.772 --> 38:36.772
What are you doing?

38:37.357 --> 38:38.440
Come on!

38:39.985 --> 38:41.026
Let's go.

39:22.110 --> 39:23.861
Did you do that?

39:29.284 --> 39:31.118
Why are you coming out
from there?

39:32.537 --> 39:35.748
I was checking all the phone plugs.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.916
They're all broken.

39:39.002 --> 39:41.378
- I’m so sorry.
- It’s okay.

39:42.047 --> 39:46.008
Who would come after someone
like me?

39:46.843 --> 39:48.427
Just worry about the students.

39:54.142 --> 39:57.436
7:35 PM. 6 hours since
Cha Jae-wook disappearance.

40:02.108 --> 40:03.067
Soo-jin?

40:05.695 --> 40:08.280
Can’t we turn the lights on?

40:08.490 --> 40:09.948
Are you out of your mind?

40:12.744 --> 40:14.912
If we do, they'll know
we’re here!

40:15.955 --> 40:17.998
But we locked the staircase entrance.

40:18.208 --> 40:20.751
Why are we in here?

40:21.294 --> 40:23.087
Cut the crap.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.303
What’s that sound?

40:37.102 --> 40:38.811
We’re the only ones here, right?

40:39.521 --> 40:41.188
We didn’t check
the other rooms.

40:42.357 --> 40:43.607
There's no one else.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.068
Turn the lights on.

40:46.069 --> 40:48.195
- Why me?
- You are closer.

41:00.333 --> 41:01.708
Hold on to me.

41:25.942 --> 41:27.067
Jae-wook!

41:34.868 --> 41:35.951
Kyung-jin.

41:36.703 --> 41:37.953
What’s that?

41:38.413 --> 41:39.538
That light...

41:40.331 --> 41:42.291
Let's go!

41:42.458 --> 41:43.417
Not again!

41:44.627 --> 41:46.461
Hurry!

42:16.201 --> 42:18.702
I want to go home.

42:20.121 --> 42:22.039
I’m fed up!

42:22.624 --> 42:23.916
If you go, you’ll die.

42:26.836 --> 42:28.128
What are you doing?

42:33.468 --> 42:36.887
Make a sentence
with the numbers and letters...

42:36.888 --> 42:38.972
Then put the password
in the computer.

42:39.891 --> 42:40.807
Five

42:41.517 --> 42:42.517
Four

42:43.978 --> 42:45.896
Nine.
That's it.

42:45.897 --> 42:47.981
- Got them all?
- Yes.

42:47.982 --> 42:49.441
Is it some formula?

42:49.692 --> 42:51.944
Any clues at alI?

42:52.987 --> 42:56.240
- Is it a determinant?
- It could be an equation.

42:56.241 --> 42:57.407
It’s 25 after.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.786
- What do we do?
- Let’s try to answer it.

43:01.579 --> 43:02.663
Hurry!

43:09.128 --> 43:10.170
What’s that?

43:13.633 --> 43:14.925
Hey, that's my room.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.552
Myung-ho must be there.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.763
- Ina!
- Ms. Choi!

44:49.062 --> 44:51.938
Wake up!

44:54.067 --> 44:55.692
Answers on the bodies?

44:57.695 --> 45:01.239
- What if it's something totally different?
- Like what?

45:01.824 --> 45:03.450
Then what's that flower?

45:03.451 --> 45:05.327
Maybe it’s a cell phone cryptogram.

45:05.787 --> 45:07.245
Could be.

45:07.914 --> 45:10.999
But Motorolas and Anycalls
have different keypads.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.959
Phone cryptogram?

45:13.336 --> 45:14.711
Mr. Kim!

45:16.255 --> 45:18.256
It's a cell phone cryptogram!

45:19.634 --> 45:22.469
It was a trend 2 years ago.

45:23.262 --> 45:24.930
You’ve seen it before, right?

45:24.931 --> 45:26.473
Kids!

45:27.517 --> 45:29.434
Come out, kids!

45:29.435 --> 45:30.977
Kids!

45:45.952 --> 45:47.160
Ms. Choi!

45:47.412 --> 45:51.498
lt’s okay.

45:53.334 --> 45:54.918
Is anyone missing?

45:54.919 --> 45:57.587
Someone took Soo-jin!

45:57.797 --> 45:58.880
By who?

45:59.048 --> 46:00.882
I don’t know.

46:00.883 --> 46:02.801
I didn't see...

46:04.679 --> 46:06.304
They almost took me, too!

46:06.305 --> 46:09.975
Me, too!
I was so scared!

46:10.309 --> 46:12.853
'Warm, spring day...
Remember...

46:14.647 --> 46:15.939
the

46:17.900 --> 46:19.776
audi...

46:20.736 --> 46:22.070
...torium"....

46:22.780 --> 46:25.449
"Warm, spring day.
Remember the auditorium".

46:25.450 --> 46:27.784
- It’s the password!
- Hurry!

46:40.298 --> 46:41.465
Myung-ho?

46:43.426 --> 46:44.509
Who's there?

46:46.345 --> 46:47.429
Ina!

46:54.353 --> 46:56.062
I’m so sorry!

46:56.647 --> 46:59.357
Don’t be, silly.

47:01.277 --> 47:03.278
I tried to save only myself...

47:03.821 --> 47:05.572
Know how much
I worried about you?

47:06.199 --> 47:07.574
So sorry.

47:08.993 --> 47:11.745
Warm, spring day.
Remember the auditorium.

47:23.549 --> 47:24.716
Ms. Choi!

47:25.510 --> 47:27.552
I was so scared!

47:27.553 --> 47:28.303
Are you okay?

47:28.596 --> 47:31.139
The kids look exhausted.

47:31.641 --> 47:33.767
It was awful!

47:33.768 --> 47:37.687
8:40 PM. Cha Jae-wook, dead.

47:40.483 --> 47:41.733
You idiots!

47:44.612 --> 47:46.446
Why'd you go off like that?

47:47.114 --> 47:48.490
Sorry, sir.

47:49.408 --> 47:52.244
Any ideas on where
Soo-jin was taken?

47:54.872 --> 47:55.747
Here.

47:56.374 --> 47:57.832
Eat something.

47:58.751 --> 47:59.668
Ina...

48:00.461 --> 48:01.795
You eat, too.

48:04.090 --> 48:05.674
What was the answer before?

48:06.217 --> 48:13.348
"Warm, spring day.
Remember the auditorium".

48:16.894 --> 48:18.186
What does that mean?

48:18.354 --> 48:19.437
What?

48:20.898 --> 48:22.190
Spring?

48:24.610 --> 48:25.944
Auditorium?

48:28.281 --> 48:29.614
Ji-won...

48:30.032 --> 48:31.533
That’s when she died...

48:35.454 --> 48:36.913
Well done, Ji-won.

48:37.456 --> 48:40.292
Studying by yourself
and always doing well!

48:40.751 --> 48:42.460
You did very well.

48:42.670 --> 48:44.921
Ji-won placed 1st
in the school!

48:51.345 --> 48:53.513
Divide the page like this.

48:53.681 --> 48:57.183
On the top, write down
what you learned in class.

48:57.518 --> 48:59.894
Then write what happened
that day, here.

49:00.980 --> 49:02.439
Yes, master.

49:03.274 --> 49:04.399
I brought noodles!

49:05.526 --> 49:06.401
Noodles?

49:07.862 --> 49:09.988
Sleep beside me.
Lay down.

49:12.283 --> 49:13.700
Here.

49:17.413 --> 49:18.830
What’s this?

49:20.124 --> 49:21.416
My little sister.

49:23.502 --> 49:24.711
Looks like me, right?

49:25.379 --> 49:27.839
My mom was a character designer.

49:28.883 --> 49:30.675
Mom said it felt like giving birth
making this.

49:30.676 --> 49:32.719
So, that’s why
I call it my little sister.

49:33.095 --> 49:35.680
She reminds me my mother.

49:36.432 --> 49:37.974
Your mom sounds cool!

49:38.684 --> 49:40.060
But she passed away.

49:43.648 --> 49:44.773
By the way,

49:46.192 --> 49:48.485
Why are you so bent
on getting scholarships?

49:51.989 --> 49:53.948
My dad's business is down.

49:54.116 --> 49:58.119
I want to pitch in.

50:07.630 --> 50:09.005
6th Kim Ji-won.

50:13.594 --> 50:15.178
Stop crying...

50:15.763 --> 50:16.846
You did well.

50:18.391 --> 50:21.393
Now, I'll have to leave
the dorm next term.

50:21.686 --> 50:22.602
Really?

50:23.604 --> 50:24.854
Is it that bad?

50:44.875 --> 50:46.000
What if...

50:47.294 --> 50:49.546
Ji-won’s ghost is
making us solve the questions?

50:49.714 --> 50:50.797
Stop it!

50:52.341 --> 50:54.592
There’s no such thing as ghosts!

50:56.637 --> 50:58.471
Some sick bastard's
after us!

51:00.975 --> 51:02.684
Ghost or no ghost...

51:03.602 --> 51:06.312
This has something to do with
Ji-won for sure, sir.

51:07.106 --> 51:08.356
Why Ji-won?

51:08.649 --> 51:10.191
Think about it.

51:10.776 --> 51:12.444
"Remember the auditorium"?

51:13.070 --> 51:14.571
lsn’t that strange?

51:14.572 --> 51:15.947
Shut the hell up!

51:16.157 --> 51:17.407
Relax.

51:17.992 --> 51:19.159
You’re scaring the kids.

51:21.829 --> 51:22.787
Who are you?

51:24.749 --> 51:26.833
Oh, you’re all in here.

51:26.834 --> 51:28.209
It's just the guard.

51:41.140 --> 51:43.767
Why are you doing this to me?

51:53.486 --> 51:54.944
Not again.

52:04.955 --> 52:05.955
Kids...

52:06.540 --> 52:07.415
Let's go!

52:07.708 --> 52:11.127
- I’m scared.
- I’m not going.

52:11.128 --> 52:12.837
We don’t all need to go.

52:14.965 --> 52:16.508
Can you watch the kids, mister?

52:26.018 --> 52:27.143
Myung-ho...

52:28.938 --> 52:30.522
Hold on to this.

52:31.398 --> 52:32.774
Don't lose it.

52:34.944 --> 52:36.194
But...

52:37.488 --> 52:38.655
Don't worry.

52:39.615 --> 52:41.157
It’ll be okay.

52:42.660 --> 52:44.661
Don't go, Ina.

52:45.162 --> 52:46.120
This time...

52:48.415 --> 52:49.874
I’ll kill you once and for all!

52:51.669 --> 52:52.919
Mr. Kim!

52:53.838 --> 52:54.963
Don't just rush out!

52:55.130 --> 52:57.340
What’s the plan?

52:58.384 --> 53:00.134
You two are the only ones coming?

53:01.470 --> 53:03.972
Just go with Ms. Choi.

53:03.973 --> 53:05.139
What are you going to do?

53:05.140 --> 53:06.641
Watch the ladies, Hyun.

53:06.851 --> 53:08.184
Don't let anything happen to them.

53:09.645 --> 53:10.562
Mr. Kim!

53:24.243 --> 53:26.536
The questions are getting harder.

53:27.121 --> 53:28.413
It's a picture of the school

53:28.956 --> 53:30.039
in puzzle pieces.

53:30.958 --> 53:32.292
It’s complicated,

53:33.294 --> 53:34.836
but they’re sentences.

53:35.921 --> 53:38.882
"Emerald, ugly, winner..."

53:40.384 --> 53:43.887
"Honked, mellow, kiwi...”

53:44.471 --> 53:46.264
"Etch, fate, hurt...."

53:46.265 --> 53:49.809
"Make a new sentence"?

53:51.145 --> 53:53.563
Then what if it's an anagram?

53:55.858 --> 54:00.028
If it is, then the puzzle
will be easier to solve.

54:01.989 --> 54:04.365
Just make new sentences
for each line.

54:06.285 --> 54:09.037
The school’s picture in the lobby
should help.

54:09.747 --> 54:11.372
It will help assembling
the puzzle.

54:12.207 --> 54:14.125
Right! I’ll go get it.

54:14.627 --> 54:16.002
Can you go alone?

54:16.295 --> 54:17.170
Of course.

54:17.796 --> 54:19.380
Be careful, Hyun.

54:54.708 --> 54:56.250
Ghost or no ghost.

54:57.962 --> 54:59.003
Come out!

56:32.431 --> 56:35.141
I know who killed me.
My anger will endure.

56:35.142 --> 56:37.060
Face the truth.

56:38.520 --> 56:39.645
Is it...

56:39.855 --> 56:40.897
the dorm?

57:00.876 --> 57:02.919
“I know who killed me".

57:05.339 --> 57:07.715
“My anger will endure."

57:09.885 --> 57:11.135
"Face...

57:12.679 --> 57:13.930
the truth.'

57:14.973 --> 57:16.516
All the questions and answers

57:18.143 --> 57:19.894
were messages on death.

57:39.331 --> 57:40.915
You scared me.

57:57.558 --> 58:00.935
12:14. Yoon Soo-jin, dead.

58:18.954 --> 58:19.912
Soo-jin...

58:22.583 --> 58:24.625
All the questions and answers

58:25.836 --> 58:28.045
are related to Ji-won.

58:28.463 --> 58:29.839
You also?

58:30.299 --> 58:31.674
You’re talking about ghosts, too?

58:35.262 --> 58:36.137
Ina?

58:36.972 --> 58:38.181
Where’s Ina?

59:04.458 --> 59:05.666
Hey!

59:09.129 --> 59:10.004
You!

59:11.715 --> 59:13.174
Who are you?

59:16.053 --> 59:17.053
Hey!

59:35.656 --> 59:37.281
Ina?

59:38.575 --> 59:39.784
What happened?

59:39.785 --> 59:41.577
Ina...You okay?

59:41.578 --> 59:43.287
I'm okay.

59:46.708 --> 59:48.709
I must be seeing things.

59:52.714 --> 59:55.675
Ina, are you ok?

59:56.635 --> 59:58.427
Yes, Ms. Choi.

59:58.637 --> 1:00:00.429
Why'd I do that?

1:00:02.975 --> 1:00:05.685
We’d better find the answer
to the first question.

1:00:07.104 --> 1:00:07.979
Right.

1:00:08.730 --> 1:00:09.814
You are right.

1:00:10.816 --> 1:00:12.984
All questions must be solved

1:00:13.235 --> 1:00:14.986
to end the test.

1:00:15.362 --> 1:00:16.404
Kang Hyun...

1:00:17.364 --> 1:00:18.948
How'd you do that before?

1:00:19.199 --> 1:00:20.116
Do what?

1:00:21.868 --> 1:00:23.536
The song...

1:00:23.787 --> 1:00:25.329
Make the song come on
during exams.

1:00:25.580 --> 1:00:28.082
That was easy!

1:00:28.292 --> 1:00:30.376
l just connected
the switch to a timer.

1:00:30.669 --> 1:00:34.422
Then I hooked my MP3
to the microphone.

1:00:35.215 --> 1:00:36.048
Why?

1:00:37.175 --> 1:00:38.301
Hye-young...

1:00:39.094 --> 1:00:40.177
Right!

1:00:41.555 --> 1:00:43.639
Let’s go to the PA room.

1:00:56.069 --> 1:00:57.611
I found it!

1:01:00.574 --> 1:01:02.325
This goes throughout

1:01:02.534 --> 1:01:04.076
the whole school.

1:01:04.369 --> 1:01:07.246
If we follow this,
there should be an A/V router.

1:01:08.206 --> 1:01:10.833
You know,
like splitting cable TV?

1:01:13.086 --> 1:01:14.587
Give me a hand, sir.

1:01:14.796 --> 1:01:15.713
Sure.

1:01:18.050 --> 1:01:18.924
Help us.

1:01:20.635 --> 1:01:22.678
Isn’t that plugged in?

1:01:22.679 --> 1:01:23.888
Come on! Pull!

1:01:34.316 --> 1:01:35.733
The line’s going down

1:01:35.984 --> 1:01:37.860
to the floor below.

1:01:51.333 --> 1:01:52.416
Hey, that’s it.

1:01:57.881 --> 1:01:59.215
This controls all the cable lines

1:01:59.216 --> 1:02:02.218
in the school.

1:02:02.636 --> 1:02:04.136
The PA room can control all the A/V

1:02:04.429 --> 1:02:08.265
in the auditorium and classes.

1:02:10.769 --> 1:02:13.687
If we follow this,
we should get some answers.

1:02:13.688 --> 1:02:16.023
Do we break through the wall?

1:02:16.817 --> 1:02:18.734
One, two, three!

1:02:36.545 --> 1:02:38.295
It’s connected through there.

1:02:43.385 --> 1:02:44.468
Wait!

1:02:45.679 --> 1:02:46.762
What’s that?

1:02:49.349 --> 1:02:50.516
Who's there?

1:02:51.768 --> 1:02:55.938
Beom?

1:02:56.565 --> 1:02:58.107
What are you doing there?

1:02:59.234 --> 1:03:00.317
Beom?

1:03:02.779 --> 1:03:04.738
What are you doing?

1:03:15.959 --> 1:03:17.543
Get back, Ina! Run!

1:03:27.471 --> 1:03:29.346
Run, Ina!

1:03:52.829 --> 1:03:59.293
Die!

1:03:59.753 --> 1:04:01.462
It was you!

1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:07.218
Let go!

1:04:07.219 --> 1:04:09.512
Are you insane? Stop!

1:04:09.513 --> 1:04:10.930
Stop!

1:04:20.482 --> 1:04:23.275
Why, Hyun?

1:04:25.445 --> 1:04:26.862
Hyun...No....

1:04:29.282 --> 1:04:42.211
Hyun!

1:04:48.552 --> 1:04:49.468
Are you okay?

1:05:54.326 --> 1:05:56.994
Open up!
You son of a bitch!

1:05:57.454 --> 1:05:59.330
Sick bastard!

1:05:59.956 --> 1:06:01.248
Open up!

1:06:01.625 --> 1:06:03.292
Stop it, please!

1:06:03.293 --> 1:06:05.169
Open up!

1:06:05.170 --> 1:06:06.337
Please!

1:06:06.546 --> 1:06:08.964
Find the secret code.

1:06:09.132 --> 1:06:10.507
Open up!

1:06:10.508 --> 1:06:12.343
Open up, bastard!

1:06:13.470 --> 1:06:14.803
I’ll kill you, bastard!

1:06:14.804 --> 1:06:16.347
Stop it!

1:06:29.361 --> 1:06:31.111
HeIp me, pIease!

1:06:33.740 --> 1:06:35.949
Who cares about questions, now?

1:06:37.786 --> 1:06:39.119
Sick bastard!

1:07:02.102 --> 1:07:03.310
Myung-ho...

1:07:05.230 --> 1:07:07.773
Wait!

1:07:11.361 --> 1:07:12.861
Multiply...

1:07:14.155 --> 1:07:16.198
the outer digits and inner digits

1:07:16.616 --> 1:07:18.158
to get the next digits.

1:07:24.290 --> 1:07:26.250
Take the outer digits.

1:07:27.043 --> 1:07:30.170
So, 5 times 5 equals 25.

1:07:31.047 --> 1:07:32.965
Place the numbers in the ends.

1:07:33.758 --> 1:07:36.051
6 times 8 equals 48.

1:07:36.636 --> 1:07:38.554
Put the numbers in the middle.

1:07:40.098 --> 1:07:41.557
Then...

1:07:42.642 --> 1:07:43.767
the next number must be,

1:07:44.644 --> 1:07:45.519
Grade 1, class 3...

1:07:47.230 --> 1:07:49.022
Student number 20.

1:07:50.316 --> 1:07:51.442
lt’s Ji-won...

1:07:55.947 --> 1:07:57.281
Too late.

1:07:58.199 --> 1:07:59.950
Wake up...Wake up!

1:08:00.326 --> 1:08:02.202
Wake up, sleepy head!

1:08:02.203 --> 1:08:03.954
It's time to wake up!

1:08:22.182 --> 1:08:23.557
- Are you okay?
- Myung-ho...

1:08:24.058 --> 1:08:26.185
Did you see
who did this to you?

1:08:27.145 --> 1:08:28.896
No, I couldn’t!

1:08:31.858 --> 1:08:33.317
Look for any clues.

1:08:35.737 --> 1:08:37.321
It hurts so much.

1:08:46.664 --> 1:08:48.665
This was the first question.

1:08:49.834 --> 1:08:50.834
Ina...

1:08:51.586 --> 1:08:53.378
I'm so scared!

1:09:01.262 --> 1:09:02.763
Hold on.

1:09:06.226 --> 1:09:07.309
Myung-ho!

1:09:16.778 --> 1:09:18.821
What did the kids ever do?

1:09:22.492 --> 1:09:24.159
Why are you doing this?

1:09:30.291 --> 1:09:32.668
What is the answer you want?

1:09:33.169 --> 1:09:34.378
What?

1:11:04.761 --> 1:11:05.969
Kill me!

1:11:59.023 --> 1:12:02.901
6:12 AM. Yoon Myung-ho dead.

1:12:04.195 --> 1:12:08.281
All too young
with too many dreams to die.

1:12:08.783 --> 1:12:12.869
We can no longer hear
your musical laughter.

1:12:13.329 --> 1:12:16.039
Or hold your warm hands, again.

1:12:17.125 --> 1:12:21.420
But we'll remember you,
dear friends.

1:12:21.629 --> 1:12:23.630
And hope you rest in peace.

1:12:25.133 --> 1:12:27.217
For all the days of our lives

1:12:27.218 --> 1:12:30.012
we’ll remember you.

1:12:31.180 --> 1:12:33.306
We'll hold you in our hearts...

1:12:33.933 --> 1:12:36.143
and won’t cry, anymore.

1:12:36.644 --> 1:12:40.939
Become bright dazzling stars.

1:13:17.351 --> 1:13:18.935
in the sky...

1:13:19.187 --> 1:13:20.520
and...

1:13:33.701 --> 1:13:34.951
How does it feel?

1:13:36.496 --> 1:13:38.163
It hurts to lose

1:13:38.998 --> 1:13:40.540
your kid, doesn't it?

1:13:41.501 --> 1:13:42.584
Me too...

1:13:43.544 --> 1:13:46.004
I lived 2 years
with the same pain.

1:13:46.422 --> 1:13:48.131
I know how it feels.

1:13:51.344 --> 1:13:52.511
I am...

1:13:53.638 --> 1:13:55.514
Kim Ji-won's father.

1:13:58.935 --> 1:14:00.018
What's that smell?

1:14:00.353 --> 1:14:01.853
It's gas!

1:14:04.065 --> 1:14:05.107
Silence.

1:14:06.609 --> 1:14:07.609
Quiet!

1:14:11.322 --> 1:14:12.405
Yes...

1:14:12.740 --> 1:14:13.782
That’s better.

1:14:17.370 --> 1:14:20.747
Keep quiet during exams.

1:14:22.875 --> 1:14:23.834
Now...

1:14:24.418 --> 1:14:28.380
for the final question.

1:14:49.610 --> 1:14:52.112
2 years ago,

1:14:52.363 --> 1:14:54.614
one fine spring day...

1:14:55.324 --> 1:14:57.409
My daughter was murdered.

1:14:59.370 --> 1:15:00.787
By someone...

1:15:03.583 --> 1:15:05.208
with a bear-shaped key chain.

1:15:07.044 --> 1:15:08.795
Who is it?

1:15:09.839 --> 1:15:11.214
Only the culprit

1:15:12.592 --> 1:15:14.134
knows the answer.

1:15:15.970 --> 1:15:17.179
You!

1:15:17.847 --> 1:15:19.055
Step forward!

1:15:20.766 --> 1:15:21.975
Confess your sin!

1:15:23.269 --> 1:15:24.853
If you don't,

1:15:26.355 --> 1:15:27.772
everyone here will die.

1:15:33.863 --> 1:15:34.988
Sir...

1:15:36.115 --> 1:15:37.741
This is for Myung-ho.
Hye-young...

1:15:37.742 --> 1:15:39.284
Dong-hyuk, and Jae-wook.

1:15:39.285 --> 1:15:40.911
I know you gave out the questions.

1:15:41.954 --> 1:15:43.246
You are corrupted!

1:15:44.582 --> 1:15:46.791
Thank you, sir.

1:15:46.792 --> 1:15:48.835
If my grades can go up,

1:15:49.921 --> 1:15:51.880
I won't tell anyone.

1:15:53.758 --> 1:15:56.635
Others may want
good grades for pride.

1:16:00.890 --> 1:16:03.183
But you know, I need them.

1:16:24.789 --> 1:16:25.705
Ji-won...

1:16:27.500 --> 1:16:28.625
Sir.

1:16:32.713 --> 1:16:34.923
Sorry. I can’t do it.

1:16:34.924 --> 1:16:36.299
Understand me...

1:16:36.842 --> 1:16:38.051
Sir...

1:16:39.303 --> 1:16:41.012
Then l’ll tell the principal.

1:16:41.722 --> 1:16:43.431
Think of what that'll do to me.

1:16:43.766 --> 1:16:45.725
They’ll fire me.

1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:48.436
l can’t believe what you did.

1:16:53.234 --> 1:16:55.360
I'll fight for my grades.

1:16:55.861 --> 1:16:57.445
If the school doesn’t solve this,

1:16:58.239 --> 1:17:00.448
I'm going to the Board of Ed.

1:17:26.976 --> 1:17:28.143
Die!

1:17:42.616 --> 1:17:44.159
Beg for forgiveness?

1:17:44.452 --> 1:17:45.994
Why?

1:17:46.537 --> 1:17:47.912
I didn’t do it alone!

1:17:51.417 --> 1:17:53.668
You bitches brought this on!

1:17:54.670 --> 1:17:56.254
You put me to it!

1:17:58.466 --> 1:18:00.133
I'm in this...

1:18:01.052 --> 1:18:02.344
over a few lousy bucks!

1:18:08.809 --> 1:18:10.935
What the hell are you staring at?

1:18:13.022 --> 1:18:15.398
- Think l'm going down alone!
- Why'd you do it?

1:18:15.733 --> 1:18:17.192
l'll kill you like your kid!

1:18:17.193 --> 1:18:18.943
I thought you were different.

1:18:22.573 --> 1:18:25.408
Come out!

1:18:31.332 --> 1:18:33.333
Mr. Kim!
Please, don’t!

1:18:36.045 --> 1:18:38.004
Mr. Kim.

1:19:00.403 --> 1:19:01.861
Mr. Kim?

1:19:27.096 --> 1:19:28.346
Ina...

1:19:33.978 --> 1:19:35.270
Are you okay?

1:19:40.526 --> 1:19:42.235
Ms. Choi!

1:20:02.256 --> 1:20:03.631
I’m sorry...

1:20:27.156 --> 1:20:29.491
- Be careful!
- Shoot!

1:20:29.492 --> 1:20:31.326
Daddy!

1:20:31.911 --> 1:20:33.953
You always win!

1:20:33.954 --> 1:20:36.247
One, two, three!

1:20:37.666 --> 1:20:40.293
Under distraint.

1:20:40.920 --> 1:20:42.045
Ji-won...

1:20:43.506 --> 1:20:44.964
Though I’m gone...

1:20:46.675 --> 1:20:48.593
you’ll be good with mom, right?

1:21:36.392 --> 1:21:38.142
Here’s the list.

1:21:40.145 --> 1:21:42.689
Patrol the grounds once every hour.

1:22:15.764 --> 1:22:18.141
Final exams ranking
1st Kang Ina.

1:22:45.210 --> 1:22:46.794
You okay?

1:22:48.797 --> 1:22:50.882
Not bad.

1:22:56.263 --> 1:22:57.972
- This is salty.
- Is it?

1:23:05.898 --> 1:23:07.273
It's almost over.

1:23:09.109 --> 1:23:10.318
Tell me...

1:23:10.819 --> 1:23:13.071
Where are you going next?

1:23:16.659 --> 1:23:18.493
To the canteen.

1:23:19.495 --> 1:23:21.079
The Kimchi’s old.

1:23:23.207 --> 1:23:24.749
It's good.

1:23:28.587 --> 1:23:29.671
Want more?

1:23:31.507 --> 1:23:32.590
No, it’s okay.

1:23:37.971 --> 1:23:39.430
I’m hungry.

1:23:40.891 --> 1:23:42.725
But I lost my appetite.
