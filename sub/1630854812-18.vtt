37:53.740 --> 37:55.042
- You went to LA.
- LA.

37:55.042 --> 37:57.010
- I have my Versace
Versace Versace shirt on.

37:57.010 --> 37:58.278
- Oh, my God.

37:58.278 --> 37:59.746
- Yeah, please don't
ever do that again.

37:59.746 --> 38:03.450
- I didn't feel bad
because Lauren even was like...

38:03.450 --> 38:05.852
- Yes. No, yeah.
- I told him not to do that.

38:05.852 --> 38:07.554
- No, my wife was like,
"Do not wear that."

38:07.554 --> 38:08.755
- And you wore it.

38:08.755 --> 38:10.323
- But I'm like,
"It's so me though."

38:10.323 --> 38:11.558
- No.
[laughter]

38:11.558 --> 38:14.661
- So guys,
where are some weird places

38:14.661 --> 38:18.031
that you guys could see us
ending up in in the future?

38:18.031 --> 38:20.267
- Weird or any place?
- It doesn't matter.

38:20.267 --> 38:23.336
Like, where do you see us
in the future?

38:23.336 --> 38:24.771
- Just think about this.

38:24.771 --> 38:26.173
Think about when the kids
are in high school.

38:26.173 --> 38:29.376
And you guys are in the stands,
cheering them on.

38:29.376 --> 38:30.944
You guys will go ape[bleep].
- Yes!

38:30.944 --> 38:32.479
Oh, that is the best.

38:32.479 --> 38:33.847
- You guys are going
to be the crazy parents.

38:33.847 --> 38:35.182
- When our kids are--

38:35.182 --> 38:37.484
- You should come to Sissy's,
the competitions.

38:37.484 --> 38:38.785
- You're already doing it,
girl.

38:38.785 --> 38:39.886
- I'm already doing it.

38:39.886 --> 38:41.354
Do you want to hear my voice?

38:41.354 --> 38:43.056

- No, I already--

39:17.324 --> 39:19.826
- You're going to be me.
You're going to be me.

39:19.826 --> 39:22.462
- I already know I'm going
to be like, "Let's go!"

39:22.462 --> 39:23.697
- No, Deena,
you're going to be worse.

39:23.697 --> 39:25.465
Let's go!

39:25.465 --> 39:28.535
- Break his [bleep] legs!
Break his legs!

39:28.535 --> 39:30.036
- CJ, break it!

39:30.036 --> 39:32.305
- [laughing] I'm like--
- No, you're going to kill it.

39:32.305 --> 39:33.807

39:33.807 --> 39:35.675
- Yes, let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

39:35.675 --> 39:38.712

of desserts.

39:54.127 --> 39:55.829

39:55.829 --> 39:57.030
All right?

40:04.004 --> 40:05.572
- All right, you're right.
- Yes.

40:05.572 --> 40:07.741
- Are you too short
to get in a Jeep?

40:07.741 --> 40:09.042
- Shut up.

40:09.042 --> 40:10.310
You're a loser.

40:10.310 --> 40:11.711

40:28.628 --> 40:30.197

40:30.197 --> 40:31.731
- Then drink it, don't kiss it.

40:31.731 --> 40:33.733
- I don't know
what I was doing. I'm drunk.

40:33.733 --> 40:35.702
