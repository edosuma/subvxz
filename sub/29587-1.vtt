00:01.302 --> 00:03.702
(film reel clicking)

00:23.657 --> 00:26.525
(phone ringing)

00:33.567 --> 00:35.300
- [Operator] US
Marshall Service.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.536
- [Mitch] Patch me to the
Marshall, Hugh Tanley.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.839
- [Operator] What's
this regarding?

00:39.840 --> 00:42.141
- [Mitch] Tell him
it's Billy Burke.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.577
(phone ringing)

00:50.351 --> 00:51.434
- [Hugh] Billy?

00:51.435 --> 00:52.518
- [Mitch] Tanley.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.720
- [Hugh] What's going on?

00:54.722 --> 00:57.056
- [Mitch] I wanna move.

00:57.058 --> 00:59.792
- [Hugh] Move, move where?

00:59.794 --> 01:01.560
- [Mitch] Anywhere.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.464
- [Hugh] Have you talked to her?

01:05.465 --> 01:07.633
You can't just take the
kids and disappear, Bill.

01:07.635 --> 01:08.868
- [Mitch] What not?

01:08.869 --> 01:10.102
- [Hugh] 'Cause you can't.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.336
- [Mitch] I wanna start over.

01:11.338 --> 01:13.338
You did it before,
you can do it again.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.606
- [Hugh] It doesn't
work like that.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.097
- [Mitch] Then explain exactly

01:16.098 --> 01:17.587
how it's suppose to fucking work

01:17.588 --> 01:19.077
'cause as far as I can
tell all you people do

01:19.080 --> 01:20.346
is yank a guy out of his life

01:20.347 --> 01:21.613
and toss him in
the fucking barrel.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.438
- [Hugh] Calm down.

01:23.439 --> 01:25.262
- [Mitch] Don't tell me
to fucking calm down.

01:25.263 --> 01:27.086
- [Hugh] Where would you be
if you back in Boston, huh?

01:27.088 --> 01:30.456
The river, the ground,
or stuffed in snowbank

01:30.458 --> 01:32.491
with your teeth knocked out
and a slug in your temple?

01:32.493 --> 01:34.293
We saved you, Bill.

01:35.463 --> 01:38.597
Just keep your head
down and live your life.

01:38.599 --> 01:42.101
You're not Billy Burke any more.

01:42.103 --> 01:45.137
(unsettling music)

02:21.408 --> 02:24.409
(doorbell chimes)

02:34.655 --> 02:36.221
- [Mitch] You
gonna pay for that?

02:36.223 --> 02:37.434
- [Darren] Just dock it.

02:37.435 --> 02:38.646
- [Mitch] Dock it from what?

02:38.647 --> 02:39.858
You're two hours late.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.729
- I had to stay after school.

02:48.235 --> 02:48.901
Fuck.

02:48.903 --> 02:49.902
- Hey.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.598
- [Principal] The
school has obligation

03:02.599 --> 03:04.850
to look into any
accusations of this nature.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.252
- [Carol] What exactly
is he being accused of?

03:07.254 --> 03:08.698
- [Principal] I'm
sure you're aware

03:08.699 --> 03:10.143
of the incident that
occurred last week?

03:10.144 --> 03:11.588
- What does that have
to do with Darren?

03:11.592 --> 03:12.925
- Several students came forward

03:12.926 --> 03:14.259
and said that he was
the one responsible

03:14.261 --> 03:15.527
for providing the narcotics.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.196
- That's ridiculous.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.364
- Miss Greenwood--
- Darren's a

03:18.365 --> 03:19.531
straight A student.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.698
- Miss Greenwood, I understand--

03:20.699 --> 03:21.865
- And who the hell are these
students you're talking about?

03:21.869 --> 03:23.269
- I can't give you that infor--

03:23.270 --> 03:24.670
- What makes their word
better than my sons?

03:24.672 --> 03:26.350
Maybe you ought
to look into them,

03:26.351 --> 03:28.029
instead of the kids they're
trying to dump all the blame on.

03:28.030 --> 03:29.708
- I don't believe that's the
situation here, Miss Greenwood.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.210
- [Carol] Based on what?

03:31.212 --> 03:34.313
- Based on Darren's behavior.

03:34.315 --> 03:37.716
He's been absent 22 days in
the last 40 days of school.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.552
His grades are plummeting,
he flunking three subjects,

03:40.554 --> 03:42.688
he's hanging around with
a different group of kids.

03:42.690 --> 03:46.892
- Why hasn't anyone
contacted me about this?

03:46.894 --> 03:50.896
- We did, I have a, I have
a signed progress report

03:50.898 --> 03:54.233
from two weeks ago
from both of you.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.386
- [Carol] Who do
you think you are?

03:57.387 --> 03:59.004
- I scribbled a name on
a piece of paper, Carol.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.372
- Why?

04:00.374 --> 04:01.273
- To avoid this.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.092
- Avoid what?

04:03.093 --> 04:04.910
- You losing your fucking
mind over nothing at all.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.912
He's a kid, kid's fuck up.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.249
He doesn't need to hear from
you when you're like this.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.751
- Did you even hear
what was said in there?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.069
Two kids died, Mitch.

04:14.070 --> 04:15.386
They were on pills
for Christ sake.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.654
- They was friends.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.290
- And now they're dead.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.923
Darren will be next if
we don't do something.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.660
- Do what, Carol?

04:21.661 --> 04:23.394
What the fuck do you wanna do?

04:23.397 --> 04:24.496
- You wanna ignore
this whole thing,

04:24.498 --> 04:25.530
act like it didn't happen?

04:25.532 --> 04:26.765
- [Mitch] That's right.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.500
- You're pathetic.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.481
- Two of his friends just died,

04:31.482 --> 04:33.693
whether he sold them
the pills or not.

04:33.694 --> 04:35.905
You think now is the
time to talk about this?

04:35.909 --> 04:38.143
- If he was your son,

04:38.144 --> 04:40.378
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

04:45.419 --> 04:47.719
(doorbell chimes)

04:47.721 --> 04:50.422
(door shuts)

04:51.458 --> 04:52.958
- When you're
finished with that,

04:52.959 --> 04:54.459
start stocking the shelves.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.960
I gotta go pick up your brother.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.132
What can I get ya?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.733
- [Customer] Pack of reds.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.345
(drawer shuts)

05:13.347 --> 05:16.415
(unsettling music)

05:21.488 --> 05:22.521
- Billy.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.990
(gun clicks)

05:25.926 --> 05:27.592
Yeah, on the the corner.

05:27.594 --> 05:28.927
Be right there.

05:30.464 --> 05:33.465
(doorbell chimes)

05:40.741 --> 05:43.775
(unsettling music)

06:59.553 --> 07:03.088
- You got your mother
in a panic, you know?

07:04.758 --> 07:07.359
I should charge you gas money

07:07.360 --> 07:09.961
for all the driving around
I just did looking for ya.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.200
What are we doin' here, Darren?

07:15.202 --> 07:16.668
- Waiting for a train.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.804
- Where you goin'?

07:18.806 --> 07:20.071
- Nowhere.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.874
- Then what are we waitin' for?

07:37.558 --> 07:39.591
How long you been here?

07:39.593 --> 07:41.827
- Since the store closed.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.599
- I don't know, but I
think a couple of trains

07:47.601 --> 07:49.134
have come by since then.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.602
- Don't be a dick.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.137
- I'm just saying.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.608
- I tried all right?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.580
- Throwing yourself
in front of a train

08:01.581 --> 08:03.081
ain't something you
try and fail at.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.116
You either do it or you don't.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.751
- I'm gonna do it.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.120
- All right.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.488
- You can't stop me.

08:09.490 --> 08:10.489
- Fine.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.531
Wanna talk about it?

08:26.073 --> 08:29.741
It ain't your fault,
you know that right?

08:36.817 --> 08:38.149
Those kids were gonna do
whatever they were gonna do

08:38.150 --> 08:40.585
whether you helped them or not.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.653
It happens.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.656
- No it doesn't.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.659
- Well it did.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.597
A lot of people
done plenty worse.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.065
- Yeah, like who?

09:04.678 --> 09:08.947
- It'll go away, you just
gotta get it out of your head.

09:11.818 --> 09:14.286
- You think it's that easy?

09:14.288 --> 09:18.757
What's the worse thing
you've ever done to somebody?

09:20.127 --> 09:21.960
If it was anything like this,

09:21.962 --> 09:24.930
you'd know this
isn't going away.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.841
- Come on, let's get outta here.

09:48.589 --> 09:51.656
(unsettling music)

11:02.663 --> 11:05.397
(car door shuts)

11:07.834 --> 11:10.168
(clanking)

11:12.172 --> 11:14.906
(trunk slams)

11:37.998 --> 11:41.066
(unsettling music)

12:14.234 --> 12:16.367
(thuds)

12:23.176 --> 12:25.510
(scraping)

12:36.990 --> 12:40.158
(gentle piano music)

13:16.196 --> 13:17.495
- You gettin' hungry?

13:17.497 --> 13:20.398
- [Darren] Nah, I'm good.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.000
- Got a coupon for
a pizza in here.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.235
I was thinking
'bout grabbing one.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.870
- [Darren] If you
get it, I'll eat it,

13:25.871 --> 13:27.504
but not really that hungry.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.952
- What did you get your
mother for Christmas?

13:40.954 --> 13:42.020
- Nothing yet.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.488
- Better get on that.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.490
- [Darren] I don't
know what to get her.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.475
- Well, you better
get her something,

13:47.476 --> 13:49.459
she's you're mother
for Christ's sake.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.895
- What did you get her?

13:50.897 --> 13:52.430
- Nothing yet.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.133
- So what are you giving
me a hard time for?

13:55.135 --> 13:57.185
- I'm just her husband,
you're her suppose

13:57.186 --> 13:59.236
to be on top of
that kind of stuff.

14:05.145 --> 14:08.213
- [Darren] Well, I don't
know what she wants.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.114
Got any ideas?

14:10.116 --> 14:13.418
- I was kinda hoping
you had something.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.287
Well, maybe we'll get
her a gift together,

14:16.289 --> 14:18.206
but it's gotta be a good one

14:18.207 --> 14:20.124
or she think we got lazy and
screwed her out of her present.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.793
- Isn't that what's happening?

14:21.794 --> 14:23.461
- Not if it's a good one.

14:23.463 --> 14:24.929
- How 'bout we get
her a gift card?

14:24.931 --> 14:27.043
- No, we can't get
her a gift card.

14:27.044 --> 14:29.156
If we get her a gift card, we
might as well get her cash.

14:29.157 --> 14:31.269
Get her cash, we might as
well get her nothing at all.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.437
- How 'bout one of those
elliptical machines

14:32.439 --> 14:34.172
she's been talking about?

14:34.173 --> 14:35.906
- No, she'll make me use it.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.877
- You know what?

14:38.878 --> 14:40.311
We can get her one of
those, one of those vacuums

14:40.313 --> 14:42.280
that cleans the floor by itself.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.493
- Those exist?

14:43.494 --> 14:44.705
- Yeah, they got 'em
at the department store

14:44.706 --> 14:45.917
down the road.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.186
- What time they open til?

14:51.157 --> 14:52.557
- Bout another half hour.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.560
(doorbell chimes)

14:57.030 --> 14:59.497
- It's a good idea, why don't
you run up there and grab one.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.633
And when you're done,
swing by and pick me up.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.202
- You sure?

15:03.203 --> 15:04.770
Mom hasn't been letting me
drive the past couple weeks.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.338
- No, I trust you.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.906
Just pick me up
when you're done.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.140
- Thanks dad.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.446
(doorbell chimes)

15:15.448 --> 15:19.217
(door shuts)
- What can I get for you?

15:19.219 --> 15:21.219
- [Customer] Newports.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.297
- Anything else?

15:34.134 --> 15:34.999
(gun fires)

15:35.001 --> 15:37.135
(thuds)

15:43.977 --> 15:45.977
- [Funeral Director]
Ten thousand.

15:45.979 --> 15:46.978
- Ten?

15:46.980 --> 15:49.831
- [Funeral Director] On average.

15:49.832 --> 15:52.683
But that varies depending
on the particulars.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.187
- What particulars
you talking about?

15:56.189 --> 15:58.589
- [Funeral Director] Well,
the casket, for instance.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.541
An average casket,
it'll set you back

16:00.542 --> 16:02.492
about two and half grand,
but that price fluctuates

16:02.495 --> 16:04.462
depending on the quality
of the specific casket

16:04.464 --> 16:05.997
that you chose.

16:24.217 --> 16:27.185
- [Eddie] How much for that one?

16:27.187 --> 16:32.090
- [Funeral Director] That
one's around four or 5,000.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.125
- I only got two.

16:34.127 --> 16:37.261
- [Funeral Director]
For the casket?

16:39.599 --> 16:41.265
- For everything.

16:45.739 --> 16:48.072
- [Funeral Director] Have
you thought about cremation?

16:48.074 --> 16:49.073
- No, no.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.478
- [Funeral Director] Well,
if you'd like I could--

16:53.480 --> 16:55.546
- I'm not burning my mother.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.482
She's gettin' buried.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.619
- [Funeral Director]
I understand

17:00.620 --> 17:02.020
where you're coming
from, but cremation--

17:02.022 --> 17:03.755
- It's not an option.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.726
She wants to be
buried, not burned.

17:13.633 --> 17:18.102
- [Funeral Director] That'll
be impossible with only 2,000.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.273
(dog panting)

17:27.513 --> 17:29.247
Look, I can give
you a couple of days

17:29.249 --> 17:31.649
to figure something out,
maybe ask a relative

17:31.651 --> 17:35.253
if they mind pitching in,
but these are the prices

17:35.255 --> 17:37.722
you're gonna find everywhere.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.590
I'm sorry.

17:42.062 --> 17:45.296
(gentle piano music)

19:35.308 --> 19:37.642
(knocking)

19:55.461 --> 19:58.362
(door squeaking)

20:00.300 --> 20:04.435
(indistinct background chatter)

20:12.512 --> 20:13.611
- Hey, Nicole.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.612
- Derek.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.452
What are you doing here?

20:21.454 --> 20:23.588
- I'm sorry, I didn't
wanna just show up,

20:23.590 --> 20:27.959
but you were suppose to
call after your appoint.

20:27.961 --> 20:29.760
- What's up?

20:29.762 --> 20:30.761
- Hi.

20:31.965 --> 20:33.698
- What's all that?

20:34.934 --> 20:38.803
- I, I got it for you
because of the doctor.

20:44.510 --> 20:48.446
Could we talk in the
other room for a minute?

20:49.649 --> 20:51.882
- You can't just show up
without calling, Derek.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.784
- I've been calling all day.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.654
- Well, my phone's been dead.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.924
- Well, how am I
suppose to know that?

20:59.926 --> 21:03.261
- You gonna tell
me what's going on?

21:03.263 --> 21:04.028
- I have no idea
what's going on.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.796
That's why I'm here.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.765
I mean how did it go?

21:08.568 --> 21:10.568
- How did what go?

21:10.570 --> 21:11.936
- You know the,

21:14.941 --> 21:15.940
the test.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.546
What, what's wrong?

21:24.817 --> 21:26.751
- Nothing, it...

21:26.753 --> 21:28.319
I'm fine.

21:28.321 --> 21:31.689
- Fine, what's that
mean, what's fine?

21:31.691 --> 21:35.493
- I mean, I mean they
didn't find anything.

21:40.033 --> 21:42.300
- That's, that's great.

22:00.953 --> 22:01.919
So?

22:03.823 --> 22:04.822
- So?

22:05.958 --> 22:08.959
- So, they didn't find anything,

22:08.961 --> 22:10.828
where's that leave us?

22:10.830 --> 22:12.630
- What do you mean?

22:13.599 --> 22:16.901
- I mean, are we getting
back together or?

22:21.607 --> 22:23.774
You said you only
wanted to break up

22:23.776 --> 22:26.510
because you might have cancer.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.364
You said you didn't
want me to be the guy

22:29.365 --> 22:30.815
with a sick girlfriend
and you needed some time.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.750
- I know what I said.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.756
- So, are we back together?

22:50.770 --> 22:52.903
I don't, I don't get it.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.775
Um, you said you only
wanted to break up

22:57.777 --> 22:59.777
because of the cancer.

23:19.932 --> 23:23.534
- [Woman] It ain't
gonna get any easier.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.586
- [Derek] Eddie.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.824
- [Eddie] You look like shit.

23:46.826 --> 23:47.858
- Gee, thanks.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.277
- I'm just saying.

23:50.278 --> 23:52.695
- Yeah, well, you're no
fucking prize either pal.

23:52.698 --> 23:54.565
Where the hell you get a dog?

23:54.567 --> 23:56.434
- She's my mother's.

24:03.443 --> 24:05.810
- How's that goin'
with your mother?

24:05.812 --> 24:07.111
- That's why I called.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.846
- Yeah, I figured.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.082
- So you got something or what?

24:12.084 --> 24:13.083
- Yeah, I got something.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.718
- Any good?

24:14.720 --> 24:16.120
- Could be.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.721
A shot in the dark, though.

24:17.723 --> 24:19.089
- Oh.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.591
- Well, if we get
done, it's 15 a pop,

24:20.593 --> 24:21.992
but I ain't sure
I like what it is.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.461
- 15 a piece?

24:23.463 --> 24:25.162
Is it coming from Lou?

24:25.164 --> 24:26.230
- I think so, but I
didn't talk to him.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.599
I talked to a Jackknife.

24:28.601 --> 24:31.101
- Oh, well let me know.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.770
- You ever heard of Billy Burke?

24:32.772 --> 24:34.738
He used to run around
with Bobby Green.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.240
Pulled a couple of
scores back in the day.

24:36.241 --> 24:37.741
- Billy Burke used
to own that store

24:37.743 --> 24:39.710
on Seymour Street when
we were kids, right?

24:39.712 --> 24:41.295
- That's the one.

24:41.296 --> 24:42.879
- I remember him, what
ever happened to him?

24:42.882 --> 24:44.482
- Fucking rat.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.067
About eight years ago
they found his brother

24:46.068 --> 24:47.651
stuffed in a snowbank
down on the waterfront.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.887
Billy flipped with the feds
and vanished not long after.

24:49.889 --> 24:51.755
- What are you saying?

24:51.757 --> 24:56.026
- Got a couple of friends of
ours put away for a while.

24:57.230 --> 25:01.098
You been a, been watching
the news last couple weeks?

25:01.868 --> 25:03.501
- A little bit.

25:03.503 --> 25:05.069
- You hear about that body they

25:05.070 --> 25:06.636
found up in New Hampshire?

25:10.276 --> 25:12.260
A couple of weeks ago
some old bombs got dropped

25:12.261 --> 25:14.245
outside a Sheriff's station,
a middle east bonfire.

25:14.247 --> 25:15.112
- Yeah?

25:15.114 --> 25:16.814
- [Derek] Yeah.

25:16.816 --> 25:17.815
- So what?

25:17.817 --> 25:22.953
- So they ID-ed the body
day before yesterday.

25:25.658 --> 25:26.924
Gordon Belkin.

25:29.996 --> 25:31.595
- Gordon Belkin?

25:32.532 --> 25:33.998
How?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.666
- Someone dug him up.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.234
- What the purpose
somebody dig him up?

25:37.235 --> 25:38.801
- I don't know, but Jackknife
says only two people

25:38.804 --> 25:40.638
knew where Belkin's
body was buried.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.106
- Bobby was one of them,
everybody knows that.

25:42.107 --> 25:43.573
- Yeah, but Bobby's got
another year left at Walpole,

25:43.576 --> 25:45.560
so they don't know
it wasn't him.

25:45.561 --> 25:47.545
- [Eddie] Who's
the other person?

25:48.915 --> 25:50.180
- Billy Burke.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.084
- Burke's in New Hampshire?

25:54.086 --> 25:56.220
- Right in the middle
of East Bumfuck.

25:56.222 --> 25:57.721
- And you wanna go get him?

25:57.723 --> 25:58.789
- 15 a pop.

26:00.593 --> 26:02.826
- You're a retarded
motherfucker, ain't ya?

26:02.828 --> 26:04.450
- I hope not.

26:04.451 --> 26:06.073
- I'm just out here and
listen to you ramble

26:06.074 --> 26:07.696
for five minutes and that's
all you came to tell me, man?

26:07.700 --> 26:09.250
- [Derek] Yeah.

26:09.251 --> 26:10.801
- I need eight grand by the
end of this week, Derek.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.128
- So what the fuck are
we doing standing around

26:12.129 --> 26:13.454
and talking about it?

26:13.455 --> 26:14.780
Let's go get him.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.106
- He's a wuss sack,
you fucking dumb ass.

26:16.108 --> 26:18.342
He's got a new name,
he's got a new life.

26:18.344 --> 26:19.743
We don't even know if
he's inside the town

26:19.745 --> 26:21.896
or inside the state.

26:21.897 --> 26:24.048
- There's only one
way to find out.

26:25.251 --> 26:29.153
- What the fuck you waste
my time with this for, man?

26:35.928 --> 26:38.295
- I gotta get out of here, man.

26:38.297 --> 26:42.199
A weekend away sound good
and 15K sounds better.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.867
- I need a sure thing.

26:43.869 --> 26:46.136
- Well you don't have one.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.039
What else you got?

27:19.305 --> 27:21.639
(thuds)

27:27.880 --> 27:30.414
(eerie music)

27:34.053 --> 27:36.987
(floor creaking)

28:16.395 --> 28:19.129
(eerie music)

28:27.373 --> 28:28.372
- Ma?

28:32.878 --> 28:35.012
What are you doing here?

28:37.116 --> 28:38.115
Ma.

28:39.919 --> 28:42.786
(intense music)

28:45.324 --> 28:47.725
(gasps)

28:47.727 --> 28:50.360
(gentle music)

28:55.835 --> 28:58.435
(upbeat music)

29:00.072 --> 29:02.973
(engine humming)

29:09.148 --> 29:12.082
- That sounds like Lake Ossipee?

29:14.887 --> 29:16.053
Think it did.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.025
I went to camp up
there one summer.

29:22.027 --> 29:23.927
Lake Ossipee.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.546
They used to have this program

29:25.547 --> 29:27.164
where they'd round
up all the kids

29:27.166 --> 29:28.816
running around the projects

29:28.817 --> 29:30.467
and ship 'em up
north for two weeks.

29:30.469 --> 29:34.271
I thought I remember
you being there.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.372
The older kids were
fucking pricks.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.040
I remember they used to,

29:37.042 --> 29:38.342
they used to take
these tube socks

29:38.344 --> 29:39.409
and fill 'em up with baby powder

29:39.411 --> 29:41.595
and whip us with 'em.

29:41.596 --> 29:43.780
Felt like getting hit
with a fucking rock.

29:43.783 --> 29:47.351
Got these white marks
all over you clothes.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.455
I remember this one night,

29:51.457 --> 29:54.391
I was sittin' in the cabin
with some older kids.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.082
I don't know what I
was doin' in there,

29:56.083 --> 29:57.772
'cause I wasn't hangin'
out with any of them,

29:57.773 --> 29:59.462
but any way, I'm
sittin' in there

29:59.465 --> 30:00.798
and I hear 'em all talking

30:00.799 --> 30:02.132
and they're talking about how

30:02.133 --> 30:03.466
they're gonna wail til we
all fall asleep that night

30:03.469 --> 30:05.286
and then they're gonna run in

30:05.287 --> 30:07.104
and beat the shit out of
us with those powder socks.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.807
So I hear that and I
think not me, right?

30:09.809 --> 30:11.341
But I don't know what to do

30:11.343 --> 30:13.210
because there are six of them

30:13.211 --> 30:15.078
and there's one of me and I
don't want to get my ass kicked,

30:15.079 --> 30:16.946
so what I ended up
doing was, I stood up

30:16.949 --> 30:18.549
and I walked right through
the their little powwow.

30:18.551 --> 30:20.884
You know, just get
their attention, right?

30:20.886 --> 30:22.870
Then I go over into
the corner of the room

30:22.871 --> 30:24.855
and I grab this, there was
a wooden broom stick there.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.356
I kicked it and snapped
it right in half.

30:26.358 --> 30:29.426
Look at the sharp
end for a second.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.562
Then I go over to the
other side of the room

30:31.564 --> 30:34.198
and I got a, there was a metal
folding chair laying there,

30:34.200 --> 30:36.178
so I grabbed the
piece of the metal

30:36.179 --> 30:38.157
and I twisted and twisted
and snapped it off.

30:38.158 --> 30:40.136
It was a little metal pipe,
I tucked in my sleeve.

30:40.139 --> 30:42.840
So then I go back over
and I sit down with them.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.608
I got the broken
broomstick in one hand,

30:44.610 --> 30:46.393
the metal pipe up my sleeve.

30:46.394 --> 30:48.177
I look 'em all square
in the face and I say,

30:48.180 --> 30:49.947
if any of you come
near me tonight

30:49.949 --> 30:52.983
I'll stab you in
the fucking chest.

30:54.253 --> 30:57.888
They didn't bother
me after that.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.591
You sure you weren't
up there with us?

31:00.593 --> 31:01.525
- No.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.998
- Probably would of liked it.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.169
I remember my a, had my
first girlfriend up there.

31:12.171 --> 31:13.403
Leah Donahue.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.240
She's from Dorchester.

31:20.179 --> 31:23.413
We used to go tubing
out on the lake.

31:31.957 --> 31:34.224
What's wrong with you?

31:34.226 --> 31:35.626
- What you mean?

31:36.896 --> 31:38.412
- I mean you been
staring out the window

31:38.413 --> 31:39.929
for the last half hour.

31:39.932 --> 31:42.532
- Aren't that windows are for?

31:42.534 --> 31:44.134
- Really?

31:44.136 --> 31:46.169
You gonna be like that?

31:48.040 --> 31:50.174
You don't wanna
talk that's fine.

31:50.175 --> 31:52.309
It's just a long fucking drive

31:52.310 --> 31:54.444
for me to be sittin' here
talking to myself the whole way.

32:00.019 --> 32:03.053
- Do you ever think
about eternity?

32:04.023 --> 32:05.022
- What?

32:06.125 --> 32:07.391
You know like,

32:09.061 --> 32:11.395
what happens after you die.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.465
- What are you talkin' about?

32:15.467 --> 32:17.200
- I just told you.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.236
- Yeah, but.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.543
- Wonder if this is it?

32:26.545 --> 32:28.345
No heaven, no hell.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.082
Just this.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.388
And nothing and then we're sad.

32:40.993 --> 32:42.392
There's nothing.

32:44.029 --> 32:47.564
I been trying to wrap
my head around this.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.367
Was just suffocating.

32:55.441 --> 32:58.375
(paper rustling)

33:01.046 --> 33:05.282
- Just shut the fuck up
and stare out your window.

33:28.040 --> 33:31.108
(soft piano music)

34:16.487 --> 34:19.456
(metal clanking)

34:28.467 --> 34:31.400
(engine humming)

34:57.196 --> 34:59.329
(thuds)

35:07.773 --> 35:09.206
- [Eddie] Derek.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.307
(dog barks)

35:10.309 --> 35:12.142
- Where'd you put it?

35:12.144 --> 35:13.110
- [Eddie] Threw it out.

35:13.112 --> 35:14.445
- Where?

35:14.446 --> 35:15.779
- [Eddie] Well, it
ain't in that dumpster.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.113
You ain't gonna
find it in there.

35:17.114 --> 35:18.447
Get ahold of yourself.

35:21.653 --> 35:24.221
- There was $300 worth
of booze in the cooler.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.422
- [Eddie] Oh yeah?

35:25.424 --> 35:26.857
Look like the good stuff.

35:26.859 --> 35:28.792
- You think this is funny?

35:28.794 --> 35:31.528
- [Eddie] No, I don't.

35:31.530 --> 35:32.796
- You owe me $300.

35:32.798 --> 35:33.730
- [Eddie] Oh yeah?

35:33.732 --> 35:35.098
- Yeah.

35:35.099 --> 35:36.465
- Well, you owe me
two hours it took me

35:36.466 --> 35:37.832
to find your drunk ass passed
out on the fucking dock.

35:37.833 --> 35:39.199
And then you owe me
another half hour

35:39.204 --> 35:40.320
it took me to drag
your drunk ass

35:40.321 --> 35:41.437
back to this fucking frozen car

35:41.440 --> 35:43.157
that you left me in.

35:43.158 --> 35:44.875
And then it took me two hours

35:44.876 --> 35:46.593
to walk to the nearest
fucking gas station

35:46.594 --> 35:48.311
and it took me two
hours to walk back.

35:49.715 --> 35:50.847
Are we done?

35:51.817 --> 35:53.884
- Yeah, I get the gist.

35:58.457 --> 35:59.789
We're almost in.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.191
- Can't stay here.

36:01.193 --> 36:02.893
- Why not?

36:02.894 --> 36:04.594
- Fucking GI Joe in there
says no dogs allowed.

36:04.596 --> 36:05.695
I already checked
three other motels

36:05.697 --> 36:07.564
and they all said the same shit.

36:07.566 --> 36:08.932
- You serious?

36:08.933 --> 36:10.299
- Let's think of
something later.

36:10.302 --> 36:13.937
Can't afford to waste
no more time up here.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.438
Where you going?

36:15.440 --> 36:17.574
- I'm gonna talk to him.

36:23.215 --> 36:24.781
- Told you he was an asshole.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.600
- There's a Bed and
Breakfast up the road.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.418
It's the only place in
town that allows dogs.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.486
- Where'd you hear that?

36:29.488 --> 36:30.720
- The guy just told me.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.289
- The guy in there?

36:32.291 --> 36:33.557
- Yeah, who else?

36:33.558 --> 36:34.824
- Well how'd you get
him to tell you that?

36:34.826 --> 36:36.593
- I asked him.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.195
- You don't think I asked him?

36:38.197 --> 36:39.863
- Yeah, well you tend to be

36:39.864 --> 36:41.530
a little fucking
abrasive sometimes.

36:41.533 --> 36:42.666
You should try
listening to people.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.534
See how it suits ya.

37:00.953 --> 37:03.887
- What's the
breakfast look like?

37:06.358 --> 37:07.891
(footsteps approaching)

37:07.893 --> 37:09.926
- [Pat] Here is dog.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.361
- Maybe God sent that.

37:11.363 --> 37:13.230
- No, I'm all right.

37:14.499 --> 37:16.299
- [Pat] All right.

37:16.301 --> 37:19.302
Tell me if you
want anything else.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.609
- So what's next?

37:25.611 --> 37:27.244
- Huh?

37:27.246 --> 37:28.746
- What are we doin'?

37:28.747 --> 37:30.247
Where we goin', how we
finding Billy Burke?

37:30.249 --> 37:31.965
- None of that, settle down,

37:31.966 --> 37:33.682
you're giving me a headache.

37:33.685 --> 37:36.253
- Derek, I didn't come
here to no fucking cereal

37:36.255 --> 37:37.821
in the bum's backyard.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.056
What's the plan?

37:39.057 --> 37:40.290
- We're gonna make a plan.

37:40.291 --> 37:41.524
That's what we're doin',
we're brainstorming.

37:41.526 --> 37:42.953
- Brainstorming?

37:42.954 --> 37:44.381
- Yeah, brainstorming.
- Brainstorming?

37:44.382 --> 37:45.809
- I'm gonna drown this hangover.

37:45.810 --> 37:47.237
We're gonna eat our breakfast

37:47.238 --> 37:48.665
and we're gonna
come up with a plan.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.000
Right now, together.

37:50.002 --> 37:52.802
So shut up and eat your cereal.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.805
- It's soggy.

37:55.807 --> 37:58.541
- [Derek] Well that's no good.

38:01.013 --> 38:02.412
(grunts)

38:02.414 --> 38:05.015
(glass clangs)

38:07.819 --> 38:10.553
- All right, so we're up here.

38:11.590 --> 38:12.455
Now what?

38:12.457 --> 38:13.723
- We find Burke.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.025
- Good.

38:15.027 --> 38:16.426
How?

38:16.427 --> 38:17.826
- Well we start by
leaving this shit hole

38:17.829 --> 38:20.297
and start looking for him.

38:21.300 --> 38:23.833
- All right, you wanna
wing it, we'll wing it.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.252
I figured you'd
wanna make a plan

38:25.253 --> 38:26.670
since you're the one
sitting here bitching

38:26.672 --> 38:28.571
about breakfast and everything.

38:28.573 --> 38:30.907
- You thought I want some
god damn cold cereal, Derek?

38:30.909 --> 38:33.977
- I mean fucking I didn't
think it was that bad.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.579
Quit wasting time, let's go.

38:40.319 --> 38:44.454
(indistinct background chatter)

38:48.560 --> 38:50.827
- Do you remember
what he looks like?

38:50.829 --> 38:52.595
- I think I'd know
him if I seen him.

38:52.597 --> 38:56.833
(overlapping background chatter)

38:58.437 --> 38:59.703
- And I won't.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.405
I'm gonna poke around a bit.

39:02.407 --> 39:03.940
- [Eddie] All right.

39:03.942 --> 39:08.078
(indistinct background chatter)

39:24.830 --> 39:28.098
- Excuse me, can I
get a beer, please?

39:39.811 --> 39:40.810
Thank you.

39:40.812 --> 39:43.396
How much?

39:43.397 --> 39:45.981
(overlapping background chatter)

40:02.934 --> 40:04.401
Mind if I sit?

40:05.837 --> 40:07.704
- I'm not gonna be here long.

40:07.706 --> 40:09.939
- Yeah, me ah, me either.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.144
I'm only in town
for a day or two.

40:14.146 --> 40:15.512
- Hmm, that's so?

40:15.514 --> 40:16.513
- Mm-hmm.

40:22.621 --> 40:25.021
- What brings you into town?

40:26.091 --> 40:28.825
- Just checking out the spots.

40:30.796 --> 40:32.429
I like this one.

40:32.431 --> 40:33.630
- In this spot?

40:33.632 --> 40:34.964
What's to like?

40:36.168 --> 40:37.700
- I don't know.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.105
Something about it.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.908
(upbeat music)

40:55.887 --> 40:59.088
¶ Laugh until we cry ¶

41:00.225 --> 41:03.993
¶ Holding it in smoke ¶

41:03.995 --> 41:05.829
¶ Counting our time ¶

41:05.831 --> 41:08.531
¶ Hoping I don't choke on this ¶

41:08.533 --> 41:11.734
¶ Reckless in love ¶

41:11.736 --> 41:15.605
¶ Through this mighty dance ¶

41:15.607 --> 41:20.143
¶ Secretly kissing each other ¶

41:20.145 --> 41:21.878
¶ Counting our time ¶

41:21.880 --> 41:23.813
¶ Hoping I don't choke ¶

41:23.814 --> 41:25.747
- Basically, there's just a
bunch of bars around here.

41:25.750 --> 41:27.116
There's a bowling
alley down the road,

41:27.118 --> 41:29.018
but that's about it.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.954
- Bowling alley,
which way do I head?

41:30.956 --> 41:31.821
Like down that way.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.156
- That way.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.490
Take a left, you can't miss it.

41:34.493 --> 41:37.660
- I'll ah, I'll have
to check it out.

41:39.898 --> 41:40.897
- Derek.

41:41.867 --> 41:43.132
He ain't here.

41:47.105 --> 41:48.204
- It was nice
talking to you, uh?

41:48.206 --> 41:49.205
- Shannon.

41:49.207 --> 41:52.192
- Nice talking to you, Shannon.

41:52.193 --> 41:55.178
¶ We see when you're crying ¶

41:56.915 --> 42:00.283
¶ Show me where you go ¶

42:03.188 --> 42:05.522
(upbeat music)

42:05.524 --> 42:07.790
- I didn't order anything.

42:11.129 --> 42:15.598
¶ How many breaks
can on heart take ¶

42:18.637 --> 42:22.906
¶ Oh and how many hearts
do you wanna break ¶

42:27.913 --> 42:32.015
¶ You made a fool
of me and it hurts ¶

42:32.017 --> 42:34.717
¶ Baby, it's so plain to see ¶

42:34.719 --> 42:38.988
¶ But how many, many
hearts will it take ¶

42:41.560 --> 42:45.562
¶ Whoa how many hearts
will it take, baby ¶

42:45.564 --> 42:46.963
¶ Yeah. ¶

42:46.965 --> 42:50.900
¶ So many times
you made me cry ¶

42:50.902 --> 42:55.004
¶ Quite a bit of tears
fall from my eyes ¶

42:55.006 --> 42:56.906
¶ You left me alone ¶

42:56.908 --> 42:59.208
¶ I'm all alone ¶

42:59.210 --> 43:03.313
¶ From your love so many times ¶

43:03.315 --> 43:06.182
¶ Baby, oh baby ¶

43:08.587 --> 43:11.354
¶ You made a fool of me ¶

43:11.356 --> 43:15.892
¶ And you best believe
I'll pay you back ¶

43:15.894 --> 43:19.295
¶ For the many times,
for many times ¶

43:19.297 --> 43:22.298
¶ You made me cry ¶

43:24.736 --> 43:27.737
(cards shuffling)

43:36.881 --> 43:39.882
- We should head
back to that bar.

43:40.885 --> 43:43.753
No sense in waste those clothes.

43:45.023 --> 43:47.090
I'll drive if you want.

43:51.763 --> 43:55.198
- Why you ask me to
come up here, man?

43:55.200 --> 43:56.716
- Huh?

43:56.717 --> 43:58.233
- You heard what I said.

44:00.071 --> 44:02.171
- You need the money,
I'm looking out for you.

44:02.173 --> 44:03.840
- You ain't looking out for me.

44:03.842 --> 44:05.759
If you came up
here to find Burke,

44:05.760 --> 44:07.677
you wouldn't have spent the
last 36 hours fucking around.

44:07.679 --> 44:11.314
I only got two more
to find the money.

44:11.316 --> 44:12.805
- I told you from the beginning.

44:12.806 --> 44:14.295
I said it's a long shot.

44:14.296 --> 44:15.785
- You knew I had no choice.

44:15.787 --> 44:17.186
Tell you what, I'm only
here for one more day,

44:17.188 --> 44:18.688
then I'm going back home.

44:18.689 --> 44:20.189
- How you gonna find the money
if you're back in Boston?

44:20.191 --> 44:21.991
- It doesn't matter.

44:21.993 --> 44:25.662
At least I won't be
here wasting my time.

44:29.367 --> 44:30.700
- All right.

44:35.407 --> 44:37.040
Here's what's gonna happen.

44:37.042 --> 44:40.810
I'm going out tonight
and when I come back,

44:40.812 --> 44:42.812
I'm gonna have a plan.

44:42.814 --> 44:44.681
Once I have that plan,

44:44.683 --> 44:46.683
we're gonna make you that money.

44:46.685 --> 44:47.684
All right?

44:50.822 --> 44:52.722
Trust me, I got this.

44:55.360 --> 44:59.829
¶ This time with you
turns into shame ¶

45:01.833 --> 45:03.433
¶ Do you regret a thing ¶

45:03.435 --> 45:04.801
- Jesus.

45:04.803 --> 45:08.137
¶ It's all the same ¶

45:08.139 --> 45:09.105
¶ All the same ¶

45:09.107 --> 45:11.340
That's a lot of chicken.

45:11.342 --> 45:14.811
- Yeah well, I figure
if I don't eat 'em,

45:14.813 --> 45:17.046
then they died for
nothing, right?

45:17.048 --> 45:18.314
- Yeah, maybe.

45:19.818 --> 45:21.217
- You want some?

45:21.219 --> 45:22.852
- No, sir, man.

45:22.854 --> 45:24.053
- You sure?

45:24.054 --> 45:25.253
I ain't gonna eat
'em, so might as well.

45:25.256 --> 45:27.890
- No, really, thank you, man.

45:30.261 --> 45:32.095
- You wanna a beer?

45:34.466 --> 45:37.100
- Eh, no, I really shouldn't.

45:37.102 --> 45:39.268
- You shouldn't, why not?

45:40.271 --> 45:43.272
- Heh, my fiance
got me on this diet.

45:43.274 --> 45:44.724
It's torture, man.

45:44.725 --> 45:46.175
I've been eating
salad and smoothie

45:46.177 --> 45:49.245
for the past month and a half.

45:49.247 --> 45:51.314
Just here for the game.

45:52.383 --> 45:53.783
- What kind of diet?

45:53.784 --> 45:55.184
One of those low-calorie diets?

45:55.186 --> 45:58.054
- Low-calorie, low-carb, no fun.

45:59.924 --> 46:01.390
- All right, I got you, man.

46:01.392 --> 46:04.861
- Hey, can I get
some vodka down here?

46:06.898 --> 46:08.030
Low-calorie.

46:13.104 --> 46:15.404
So then I look them
all square in the face

46:15.406 --> 46:18.007
and I say, if any of you
come near me tonight,

46:18.009 --> 46:19.909
I'll stab you in
the fucking chest.

46:19.911 --> 46:22.044
- And they believed you?

46:22.046 --> 46:23.813
- Yeah, I meant it.

46:24.816 --> 46:26.115
Can't let 'em walk all
over you like that.

46:26.117 --> 46:27.750
Sometimes you gotta
break a broomstick

46:27.751 --> 46:29.384
and act like a fucking nut case.

46:29.387 --> 46:31.454
- All right, tough guy.

46:34.058 --> 46:37.093
- [Bartender] Last
call, gentlemen.

46:38.129 --> 46:41.063
- All right, I'm gonna
head to the bathroom.

46:41.065 --> 46:43.166
- I'll alert the media.

46:44.202 --> 46:46.502
¶ Some people think
you were never now ¶

46:46.504 --> 46:49.972
¶ As long as you know ¶

46:52.010 --> 46:54.076
¶ She's turning around ¶

46:54.078 --> 46:58.347
¶ I'm bailing on
the town, monster ¶

47:03.254 --> 47:06.055
(splashing)

47:06.057 --> 47:08.991
¶ Wished that we ¶

47:10.228 --> 47:14.096
¶ Could carry on each day ¶

47:14.098 --> 47:16.132
¶ Ever so sweet ¶

47:16.134 --> 47:17.400
- What's that?

47:19.370 --> 47:20.570
- This?

47:20.572 --> 47:21.571
It's beer.

47:23.174 --> 47:24.874
- Where's mine?

47:24.876 --> 47:26.108
- Yours?

47:26.110 --> 47:27.510
Gotta order one.

47:28.847 --> 47:30.112
- I gotta order one?

47:30.114 --> 47:31.514
- Yeah.

47:31.515 --> 47:32.915
That's how it works, isn't it?

47:32.917 --> 47:36.052
You order a beer,
they give you one.

47:39.023 --> 47:41.707
- That's funny 'cause the,

47:41.708 --> 47:44.392
the last four times I ordered
a shot, they gave me two.

47:44.395 --> 47:47.930
Pretty sure they charged me
for each of them as well.

47:47.932 --> 47:50.399
Every time I ordered two
shots and paid for two shots,

47:50.401 --> 47:53.069
I slid on of them
in your direction.

47:53.071 --> 47:54.070
- Yeah.

47:55.206 --> 47:56.205
Thanks.

47:56.207 --> 47:58.725
- No problem, what
I'm gettin' at is

47:58.726 --> 48:01.244
I bought you four
shots just now.

48:01.246 --> 48:03.880
- I heard what you said.

48:03.882 --> 48:07.617
- Good, then you see how this
seems a little fucking rude.

48:07.619 --> 48:09.418
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

48:09.420 --> 48:11.095
(intense music)

48:11.096 --> 48:12.771
- You think this is right?

48:12.772 --> 48:14.447
I duck out for two
seconds, I come back

48:14.448 --> 48:16.123
and you bought yourself a
drink and didn't get me one.

48:16.127 --> 48:18.094
- I didn't ask you to
buy me four drinks, bro.

48:18.096 --> 48:19.195
- You didn't have to ask, bro.

48:19.197 --> 48:21.964
That's what I'm talking about.

48:21.966 --> 48:23.165
- Do you want a drink?

48:23.167 --> 48:25.101
I'll buy you a drink.

48:26.304 --> 48:27.436
- Don't talk to me like I'm
begging you for something.

48:27.438 --> 48:29.372
It's common fucking courtesy.

48:29.374 --> 48:31.274
- All right, all
right, sweetheart.

48:31.276 --> 48:33.109
You want a drink,
I'll buy you a drink.

48:33.111 --> 48:35.511
- So now you're gonna be a
fucking smart ass about it?

48:35.513 --> 48:36.713
- I'm just buying you a drink.

48:36.714 --> 48:37.914
Isn't that what you wanted?

48:37.916 --> 48:40.316
(intense music)

48:40.318 --> 48:41.784
- You know what?

48:41.785 --> 48:43.251
I don't want your fucking drink.

48:43.254 --> 48:46.188
- Then what are
you crying about?

48:48.660 --> 48:50.459
- This one's on me.

48:52.330 --> 48:53.329
Drink it.

48:56.234 --> 48:59.435
¶ Carry me, carry me ¶

49:00.705 --> 49:05.141
¶ Can't you see now,
I'm barely breathing ¶

49:08.646 --> 49:09.979
- Thanks.

49:09.981 --> 49:11.180
- Don't thank me.

49:11.182 --> 49:13.649
It's common fucking courtesy.

49:15.987 --> 49:18.020
(leaves rustling)

49:18.022 --> 49:20.690
- [Eddie] Fucking
cheap ass, Derek.

49:20.692 --> 49:23.192
Got me all the way out
here in these fucking woods

49:23.194 --> 49:24.727
cleaning up all
this fucking beer

49:24.729 --> 49:27.363
this motherfucker done drunk.

49:28.099 --> 49:29.098
Fuck.

49:37.508 --> 49:38.374
(dog barks)

49:38.376 --> 49:39.375
Hush.

49:41.346 --> 49:43.746
(dog barks)

49:45.984 --> 49:47.283
Oh, shit.

49:47.285 --> 49:48.551
Derek.

49:48.553 --> 49:50.052
Sadie.

49:50.054 --> 49:51.053
Sadie.

49:55.393 --> 49:58.327
(water bubbling)

50:00.631 --> 50:03.099
(exhales)

50:06.671 --> 50:07.670
- Sorry.

50:08.539 --> 50:09.638
- For what?

50:11.309 --> 50:12.675
- I don't know.

50:16.347 --> 50:17.680
- Well you gonna
come and sit down

50:17.682 --> 50:20.683
or are you just
gonna stand there?

50:27.025 --> 50:28.090
- You're pretty good at that.

50:28.092 --> 50:29.091
- I know.

50:32.797 --> 50:35.197
So you always go around
pulling guns on people?

50:35.199 --> 50:36.766
- (laughs) I wasn't
gonna hurt him,

50:36.768 --> 50:38.334
I was just gonna scare him.

50:38.336 --> 50:39.786
He was being a prick.

50:39.787 --> 50:41.237
- Yeah, well he's
always been a prick.

50:41.239 --> 50:42.638
We went to school together
when we were kids.

50:42.640 --> 50:44.473
- Oh yeah?

50:44.474 --> 50:46.307
- Yeah, his family owns the
only decent asian restaurant

50:46.310 --> 50:47.977
in 60 miles though.

50:47.978 --> 50:49.645
It's one of the ones that they
cook food in front of you.

50:49.647 --> 50:51.680
- It's a hibachi place?

50:51.682 --> 50:53.816
- Yeah, whatever
it is, it's good.

50:53.818 --> 50:55.151
I don't go there though.

50:55.153 --> 50:56.552
His whole family is ass holes.

50:56.554 --> 50:58.454
- Yeah, I believe it.

51:02.226 --> 51:03.125
This is little Shannon?

51:03.127 --> 51:04.727
- [Shannon] Mm-hmm.

51:07.165 --> 51:09.365
- That your dad with you?

51:12.603 --> 51:13.636
This is his place?

51:13.638 --> 51:15.071
- It was.

51:15.073 --> 51:16.205
- Oh, sorry.

51:17.608 --> 51:19.608
- He's not dead, he's just sick.

51:19.610 --> 51:23.212
Dementia, he's at an assisted
living place down the road.

51:23.214 --> 51:24.513
- Dementia, that's like uh,

51:24.515 --> 51:26.115
that's like Alzheimers, right?

51:26.117 --> 51:27.450
- They're basically
the same thing,

51:27.452 --> 51:29.218
but you can't be
diagnosed with Alzheimer

51:29.220 --> 51:30.786
until after you're
dead, so until,

51:30.788 --> 51:33.622
they say you have dementia.

51:33.624 --> 51:34.490
- Sorry to hear that.

51:34.492 --> 51:35.624
- It's okay.

51:38.496 --> 51:41.130
- So this is your place?

51:41.132 --> 51:42.732
- Mm-hmm.

51:42.733 --> 51:44.333
I have the mortgage
bills to prove it.

51:44.335 --> 51:45.718
- That sucks.

51:45.719 --> 51:47.102
- [Shannon] Yeah, it does.

51:47.105 --> 51:48.170
- Cops get a decent
pension though, right?

51:48.172 --> 51:49.655
That's gotta help.

51:49.656 --> 51:51.139
- That doesn't even cover
his assisted living.

51:51.142 --> 51:52.575
- No?

51:52.576 --> 51:54.009
What do you do to
pay for it all?

51:54.010 --> 51:55.443
- [Shannon] I'm a
Dental Hygienist.

51:55.446 --> 51:56.645
- No you're not.

51:56.647 --> 51:58.647
- [Shannon] Yeah I am.

51:58.649 --> 52:00.449
- I knew there had to be
something wrong with you.

52:00.450 --> 52:02.250
- You have a problem
with dental hygienists?

52:02.253 --> 52:04.253
- It's not the, it's
the whole teeth thing,

52:04.255 --> 52:05.654
showing my teeth
kinda freaks me out.

52:05.656 --> 52:07.656
- Oh my God, you're
one of those people.

52:07.658 --> 52:09.592
- What's that suppose to mean?

52:09.593 --> 52:11.527
- Nothing, I just think
you're a bit of a wimp.

52:11.529 --> 52:13.395
- I'm not a wimp,
but I just don't like

52:13.397 --> 52:15.364
when people mess
around with my teeth.

52:15.366 --> 52:17.666
- [Shannon] What
about the dentist?

52:17.668 --> 52:19.135
You don't go to the dentist?

52:19.137 --> 52:20.903
- Never.

52:20.904 --> 52:22.670
- That's horrible, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

52:22.673 --> 52:24.473
- I brush my teeth
everyday, I'm not filthy.

52:24.475 --> 52:27.610
I just like to do it on my own.

52:27.612 --> 52:28.677
- [Shannon] Open your mouth.

52:28.679 --> 52:29.728
- Why?

52:29.729 --> 52:30.778
- [Shannon] Just do it.

52:30.781 --> 52:31.747
- What are you gonna do to me?

52:31.749 --> 52:32.681
- [Shannon] Nothin'.

52:32.683 --> 52:35.551
- I don't trust you.

52:35.552 --> 52:38.420
- Come on, quit being a
pussy and open your mouth.

52:42.193 --> 52:43.259
Looks fine.

52:43.828 --> 52:45.327
- That's it, I'm good to go?

52:45.329 --> 52:46.846
- Mm-hmm.

52:46.847 --> 52:48.364
- That's the dental
hygienist stamp of approval?

52:48.366 --> 52:51.700
- That's why they
pay me the big bucks.

52:56.174 --> 52:57.273
I'm gonna go get some coke.

52:57.275 --> 52:58.641
Do you want some?

52:58.643 --> 53:00.743
- Ah, I'm good
with this for now.

53:00.745 --> 53:01.710
Thanks.

53:16.661 --> 53:20.729
¶ There's no water coming down ¶

53:23.467 --> 53:26.735
¶ Not pouring any more ¶

53:26.737 --> 53:29.872
- This ah, is this
Old Orchard Beach?

53:29.874 --> 53:31.407
- Uh, probably.

53:32.743 --> 53:35.077
- I used to love this
place when I was a kid.

53:35.078 --> 53:37.412
They use to have this big
carnival up at the 4th of July.

53:37.415 --> 53:39.515
- Oh yeah, we used
to go there for that.

53:39.517 --> 53:40.382
- Really?

53:40.384 --> 53:41.367
- Mm-hmm.

53:41.368 --> 53:42.351
- [Derek] Oh shit.

53:42.353 --> 53:45.054
- What?

53:45.055 --> 53:47.756
- Nothing, I just, I
thought you meant, you know.

53:47.758 --> 53:51.227
- You thought I meant
like coke, coke.

53:51.929 --> 53:53.729
- [Derek] Uh, yeah.

53:54.899 --> 53:57.733
- It's funny how that
doesn't happen more often.

53:57.735 --> 53:59.235
- Yeah, I guess.

53:59.237 --> 54:00.937
- Well, I'm sorry, I didn't mean

54:00.938 --> 54:02.638
to freak you out or anything.

54:02.640 --> 54:04.140
- No, that's fine.

54:04.141 --> 54:05.641
I just wasn't expecting
it, that's all.

54:05.643 --> 54:07.276
- So you don't mind if I?

54:07.278 --> 54:09.278
- No, that's cool, I really,

54:09.279 --> 54:11.279
it doesn't matter, I just, it
caught me a little off guard.

54:11.282 --> 54:12.815
- Well, okay then.

54:16.554 --> 54:18.420
Do you ever do blow?

54:19.624 --> 54:21.624
- Ah, I used to a bit,

54:22.727 --> 54:26.662
but my ex wasn't big
into that kind of stuff,

54:27.431 --> 54:30.299
so I kind of gave it up for her.

54:33.571 --> 54:36.805
- You always do what
people tell you?

54:51.022 --> 54:53.555
- What was your name again?

54:53.557 --> 54:54.556
- Eddie.

54:56.861 --> 54:58.827
- That's a good name.

54:59.730 --> 55:00.729
I'm Pat.

55:05.970 --> 55:07.603
You like my name?

55:08.973 --> 55:12.474
- Yeah, I mean sure, I guess so.

55:12.476 --> 55:15.844
- Eh, I never liked
it, too, too plain.

55:18.015 --> 55:20.949
Now my brother
had a better name.

55:24.822 --> 55:25.955
Here.

55:25.956 --> 55:27.089
- Nah, I'm all right, man.

55:30.594 --> 55:32.461
- You do this often?

55:35.433 --> 55:36.699
- Most nights.

55:38.002 --> 55:39.001
- Why?

55:40.971 --> 55:42.104
- I like it.

55:44.108 --> 55:45.474
I like space.

55:49.480 --> 55:50.846
You like space?

55:52.583 --> 55:54.350
- I guess so.

55:54.352 --> 55:58.387
You know I really don't
know much about it though.

55:58.389 --> 56:01.423
- Nobody knows much
about anything.

56:06.630 --> 56:08.497
What's that one right there?

56:08.499 --> 56:11.367
- That's the North
Star, isn't it?

56:11.369 --> 56:12.368
- Good.

56:13.971 --> 56:15.371
It's Polaris.

56:16.107 --> 56:17.606
- Polaris?

56:17.608 --> 56:20.776
- Yeah, for now,
it's the North Star.

56:24.815 --> 56:27.049
- But the purpose
of the North Star

56:27.051 --> 56:28.751
is that it's always
the same star.

56:28.753 --> 56:30.652
It's always in the
same place, right?

56:30.654 --> 56:35.090
Sailors use it like a,
like a compass, right?

56:35.092 --> 56:36.925
That sort of thing.

56:37.895 --> 56:40.896
- It's been the same
for 5,000 years,

56:42.867 --> 56:46.402
but before that it
was a different one.

56:47.671 --> 56:51.740
And another one before that
and another one before that.

56:52.810 --> 56:56.478
13,000 years from now,
it'll change again

56:58.749 --> 57:01.450
and again and again and again.

57:04.054 --> 57:06.522
- How far does that go on?

57:07.425 --> 57:07.689
- Forever.

57:12.029 --> 57:14.096
My brother liked space.

57:17.501 --> 57:20.502
- That's how you
got into it, huh?

57:31.849 --> 57:34.583
How, how did your brother die?

57:35.119 --> 57:37.719
If you don't mind me asking.

57:40.891 --> 57:42.758
- He died in a fire.

57:54.004 --> 57:56.605
- You remember what you did?

58:01.078 --> 58:02.878
- What do you mean?

58:04.615 --> 58:06.148
- I mean like how,

58:07.751 --> 58:10.219
I mean how'd you get over it?

58:15.793 --> 58:20.062
- (sighs) You don't get
over things like that.

58:42.953 --> 58:44.436
¶ Never seen a woman ¶

58:44.437 --> 58:45.920
- Batman, peanut butter?

58:45.923 --> 58:46.788
Nine eleven.

58:46.790 --> 58:49.158
- Nine eleven?

58:49.159 --> 58:51.527
- Okay, shut up, you're
not allowed to talk.

58:53.898 --> 58:56.198
(clears throat)

58:56.200 --> 58:57.533
- All right.

59:01.605 --> 59:03.872
- [Shannon] Stevie Nicks?

59:03.874 --> 59:04.940
Rain dance?

59:06.277 --> 59:07.276
Seizure?

59:07.278 --> 59:09.244
- I don't wanna
do this any more.

59:09.246 --> 59:11.079
- Oh come on.

59:11.081 --> 59:12.181
- You just, you're
not even trying.

59:12.182 --> 59:13.282
You're making me stand up here

59:13.284 --> 59:15.083
and I look like an idiot.

59:15.085 --> 59:16.051
This ain't, this
ain't fun for me.

59:16.053 --> 59:17.686
- [Shannon] What?

59:19.924 --> 59:21.290
- It's embarrassing.

59:21.292 --> 59:22.891
- You were doing so good though.

59:22.893 --> 59:25.160
- Don't patronize me,
you're making it worse.

59:25.162 --> 59:26.828
- [Shannon] Fine.

59:27.831 --> 59:30.332
- Patronize sound
like patron eyes,

59:30.334 --> 59:32.801
like the eyes of a patron.

59:33.704 --> 59:36.171
No one ever talks about that.

59:37.107 --> 59:40.208
Probably because
it's not interesting.

59:41.211 --> 59:43.211
- What word did
you have any ways?

59:43.213 --> 59:46.715
- [Derek] I don't
wanna tell you.

59:46.717 --> 59:47.716
- [Shannon] Squid?

59:47.718 --> 59:48.751
- Leave me alone.

59:48.752 --> 59:49.785
- [Shannon] Have you
ever even seen a squid?

59:49.786 --> 59:50.819
- Leave me alone.

59:50.821 --> 59:52.988
(laughs)

59:54.124 --> 59:55.991
- I think I'm gonna
head up to bed soon.

59:55.993 --> 59:58.060
- Yeah.

59:58.061 --> 01:00:00.128
- Mm-hmm, you can crash on
the couch though, if you want.

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.446
- The couch?

01:00:01.447 --> 01:00:02.763
After what you just
put me through?

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.132
- That's right.

01:00:05.336 --> 01:00:07.135
It's a comfy couch though.

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:09.137
- It is a comfy couch.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.874
What time is it any way?

01:00:12.876 --> 01:00:14.176
Aw, shit.

01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:15.711
- What's wrong?

01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:18.280
- Ah, nothing, it
just I told my friend

01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:19.948
I'd come back with a plan.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:21.350
- Plan for what?

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:25.487
- He needs money.

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:28.222
I told him that I might
be able to get him some,

01:00:28.225 --> 01:00:31.226
but doesn't look like
that's gonna happen.

01:00:31.228 --> 01:00:33.095
- That sucks.

01:00:33.097 --> 01:00:34.096
- Yeah.

01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:38.033
He'll probably fucking
disown me after this.

01:00:38.035 --> 01:00:40.936
(sighs)

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:43.838
- Well too bad you can't
call your buddy from the bar.

01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:45.407
- Who?

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:49.645
- Peter Cheung, the Asian guy.

01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:52.247
- What about him?

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:54.833
- Well, he's rich.

01:00:54.834 --> 01:00:57.418
I don't know if he is rich,
but his family's rich.

01:00:57.421 --> 01:00:59.855
- I thought you said his
family owned a hibachi place.

01:00:59.857 --> 01:01:02.057
- Yeah, like five
other businesses.

01:01:02.059 --> 01:01:06.328
They have more money that
they know what to do with.

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:11.333
- You wanna rob a hibachi place?

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:12.979
- Just shut up and
hear me out, all right?

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.624
The guy who owns this place
is a local fucking monopoly.

01:01:14.625 --> 01:01:16.269
He's got six businesses
and he stashes all the cash

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:17.339
in his office at the restaurant.

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:18.696
- And how do you know this?

01:01:18.697 --> 01:01:20.052
- A friend of mine
used to work at his a,

01:01:20.053 --> 01:01:21.408
at his flower shop when
she was in high school.

01:01:21.412 --> 01:01:22.778
- What friend?

01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:24.145
- Nevermind, what friend.

01:01:24.146 --> 01:01:25.512
Look, she said that when she
worked in the flower shop,

01:01:25.513 --> 01:01:26.879
she used to make daily
runs to the hibachi place

01:01:26.884 --> 01:01:29.485
'cause the guy keeps the
cash from all six businesses

01:01:29.486 --> 01:01:32.087
stashed in the, in a safe
in the back office there.

01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:33.655
- You wanna tell
me what the fuck

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:35.222
that is over there?

01:01:35.225 --> 01:01:37.192
(dog barks)

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:38.247
- That's the get away car.

01:01:38.248 --> 01:01:39.301
- The get away car?

01:01:39.302 --> 01:01:40.355
- Yeah, the get away car.

01:01:40.356 --> 01:01:41.409
- You wanna tell me
where the fuck is the car

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:42.463
we're suppose to drive home in?

01:01:42.466 --> 01:01:43.559
- It's at my friend's place.

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.653
- What friend?
- Nevermind what friend.

01:01:44.654 --> 01:01:45.747
- You and that shit.

01:01:45.748 --> 01:01:46.841
- What does that have
to do with anything?

01:01:46.842 --> 01:01:47.935
Look, I got this thing
at the junk yard.

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:50.556
It was 500 bucks plus
200 to fix the engine,

01:01:50.557 --> 01:01:53.175
but we'll talk about that
after we hit the restaurant.

01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:56.078
If we hurry, we can go now

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:58.079
while they're getting
ready to open.

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:00.616
- What about Billy Burke?

01:02:00.617 --> 01:02:01.984
- Fuck Billy Burke,
it's like you said,

01:02:01.985 --> 01:02:03.352
we're never gonna find that guy.

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:04.720
I mean you need, you
need the money, right?

01:02:04.722 --> 01:02:06.071
You need the money, you said
I come back with a plan,

01:02:06.072 --> 01:02:07.421
this is what I got for you.

01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:10.792
What do you say?

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:19.000
(Asian music)

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:34.883
¶ Doh-doh-da-doh-doh ¶

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:37.018

¶ You brush up against me ¶

01:02:54.838 --> 01:02:57.305
¶ I wanna kiss you down ¶

01:02:57.307 --> 01:03:00.175
¶ Oh I get that feeling ¶

¶ Yes I lose control ¶

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:37.713
- Hands up.

01:03:37.714 --> 01:03:39.081
- I don't know, I don't know,
- Open the fucking safe.

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:40.449
- the code man.
- What do you mean

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:41.817
you don't know the fucking code?

01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:43.272
- Its my dads.
- That's a fucking lie.

01:03:43.273 --> 01:03:44.726
Fuck you're fucking dad.

01:03:44.727 --> 01:03:46.180
Put the fucking
money in the bag.

01:03:46.181 --> 01:03:47.634
- I don't know the code, man.
- Put the fucking money

01:03:47.635 --> 01:03:49.088
in the bag!
(gun fires)

01:03:49.092 --> 01:03:51.426
- What's going on out here?

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:53.270
(speaking in foreign language)

01:03:53.271 --> 01:03:54.312
- [Derek] Oh shit.

01:03:54.313 --> 01:03:55.354
(gun fires)
Shit, shit.

01:03:55.355 --> 01:03:56.396
- [Eddie] I knew that
fucking, I knew that--

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.501
(gun fires)

01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:01.236
- [Derek] Eddie, you okay?

01:04:01.238 --> 01:04:03.839
- [Eddie] Don't say my
fucking name, dumb ass.

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:04.506
(groaning)

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:06.241
(gun fires)

01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:07.242
- [Derek] I leave
you just two fucking

01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:13.122
(gun fires)

01:04:13.123 --> 01:04:13.729
seconds this is what happens.
(gun fires)

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:14.336
- [Eddie] She's got a
fucking shotgun, Derek.

01:04:14.337 --> 01:04:14.943
- [Derek] Yeah, I noticed.

01:04:14.944 --> 01:04:15.550
(gun fires)
- [Eddie] You see that bitch

01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:16.157
is gotta a gun.

01:04:16.158 --> 01:04:16.764
- [Derek] What do
you think I gave her

01:04:16.765 --> 01:04:17.371
(gun fires)
fucking pistol?

01:04:17.372 --> 01:04:17.978
She's got guns, how
is this my fault?

01:04:17.988 --> 01:04:19.763
- [Eddie] All right,
let's go, let's go.

01:04:19.764 --> 01:04:21.539
(gun fires)
Let's do it on three, ready?

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:23.315
- [Derek] Three.

01:04:23.316 --> 01:04:25.091
(guns firing)
That wasn't three.

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:40.308
- I didn't get the safe.

01:04:44.348 --> 01:04:46.281
Fucking, the kid
didn't know the code

01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:48.583
and then all the
shooting started,

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:52.120
so I didn't have time
to figure it out.

01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:01.596
(speaking faintly)

01:05:23.387 --> 01:05:26.454
What'd you get
from the register?

01:05:26.456 --> 01:05:28.256
- A couple hundred.

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:33.094
- It's all coming
together white car.

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:36.197
- You think it's a
fucking joke, don't you?

01:05:36.199 --> 01:05:37.599
- Just trying to
lighten the mood.

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:39.601
- You trying to lighten
the fucking mood.

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:41.602
That's what you were trying
to do this whole time,

01:05:41.603 --> 01:05:43.603
trying to lighten the
fucking mood, huh, huh?

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:45.473
- It was a joke all
right, I'm sorry.

01:05:45.475 --> 01:05:47.943
- You ain't sorry, so don't
fucking at like it, Derek.

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:49.311
- Oh so, now you
what I'm thinking?

01:05:49.313 --> 01:05:50.612
- You ain't sorry, Derek.

01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:52.614
You fucked up is what you are.

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:54.115
You've been drunk since
before we left Boston,

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:55.283
and now you fucking snort coke

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:56.618
in a fucking catering truck.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:58.086
- Is there a point
you're trying to get at

01:05:58.087 --> 01:05:59.553
or are we just talking shit now?

01:05:59.554 --> 01:06:01.020
- My point is you
gotta a fucking problem

01:06:01.024 --> 01:06:02.190
and it's starting to affect...

01:06:02.192 --> 01:06:03.658
That's my fucking point.

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.193
- Oh, I got a problem?

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:06.727
- Yes, you got a
fucking problem.

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:08.029
- And what about you, huh?

01:06:08.031 --> 01:06:09.164
What's your excuse?

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:11.433
I'm fucked up, okay.

01:06:11.435 --> 01:06:13.535
And what about you?

01:06:13.537 --> 01:06:14.937
'Cause as far as I can remember

01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:16.338
I haven't forced you to do shit.

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.962
You chose to come up with me

01:06:17.963 --> 01:06:19.585
and you chose to come
with me this morning,

01:06:19.586 --> 01:06:21.208
so don't fucking try to pin
it all on me when it's...

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:22.911
there's something in your head

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:24.612
making you make those choices.

01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:29.317
(thumps)

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:30.352
- Holy shit.

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:32.520
- What the fuck was that?

01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:36.391
- How far is the car?

01:06:38.528 --> 01:06:41.129
- About five miles that way.

01:06:45.602 --> 01:06:47.202
Where you going?

01:06:51.675 --> 01:06:53.274
Where you going?

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:56.244
- [Eddie] I need a minute.

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:58.046
- [Derek] For what?

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:04.686
I'm gonna pick up the car.

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:07.155
Call me when you're ready.

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:14.696
You all right?

01:07:21.138 --> 01:07:23.738
(gentle music)

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.544
- [Shannon] Well look who it is.

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:38.712
- [Derek] There you are.

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:40.782
I was wondering where
you took off to.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:43.118
- I went to see my father.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.319
- [Derek] Yeah?

01:08:44.321 --> 01:08:45.319
How is he?

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:53.728
- Hi.

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:54.729
- Hey.

01:08:56.233 --> 01:08:57.232
You all right?

01:08:57.234 --> 01:08:58.832
- What do you mean?

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:01.703
- I mean you almost did
a face plant just then.

01:09:01.705 --> 01:09:04.538
- Ah, it's just
these stupid boots,

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:07.408
they're real hard to balance in.

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:13.548
I smoked a bag of
fuel on my way home.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:15.149
- Oh, all right.

01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:18.219
- Where you headed?

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.288
- Uh, I was thinking
about heading home.

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:22.290
- Home?

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:25.727
- Yeah, my friend's been
having gone with a rough time

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:28.563
and well I'm up here on a
bit of a wild goose chase,

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:32.367
so I figure I should
probably get him back.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.170
Look, I'd rather stay here
and hang out with you,

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:38.173
I just, I gotta
run, head into town

01:09:38.175 --> 01:09:39.707
and pick up a few things
before we hit the road,

01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:40.841
so I'm sorry.

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:42.277
- It's, it's, it's all good.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:43.444
I understand.

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:51.252
- You wanna a, you
wanna come with me?

01:09:51.254 --> 01:09:52.453
- Come where?

01:09:52.455 --> 01:09:54.322
- Into town.

01:09:54.324 --> 01:09:56.457
- You want me to come?

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:57.870
- Ah, yeah if you want.

01:09:57.871 --> 01:09:59.282
I just gotta run by the place

01:09:59.283 --> 01:10:00.694
we've been staying
and pick up the dog.

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:03.364
I won't be able to
give you a ride back.

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.083
Not cause I'm lazy
or I don't want to,

01:10:05.084 --> 01:10:06.801
I just, I don't know
what time, you know,

01:10:06.803 --> 01:10:08.336
my friend's gonna call
me and I'm gonna have to

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:10.405
go pick him up and
I don't wanna say

01:10:10.407 --> 01:10:11.639
I'm gonna give you a ride now

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:13.341
and not be able to do it.

01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:15.343
- It's a, you know,
I was actually gonna

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:17.979
go into town anyway,
so it works out.

01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:19.581
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:23.685
Ah, shit.

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:26.047
- What's wrong?

01:10:26.048 --> 01:10:27.341
- It's just you're not suppose

01:10:27.342 --> 01:10:28.635
to keep this out of
the cold for too long.

01:10:28.636 --> 01:10:29.929
Do you mind if I throw
it in your freezer

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:31.223
when we get there?

01:10:31.228 --> 01:10:33.261
- Ah, sure, what is it?

01:10:33.263 --> 01:10:35.863
- I already told you, it's PCP.

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:39.133
- When the hell did
you tell me that?

01:10:39.134 --> 01:10:41.401
- I told you I smoked a
bag of fuel on my way home.

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:42.670
- That's what fuel is?

01:10:42.672 --> 01:10:45.273
- Yeah, what did
you think it was?

01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:46.641
- I don't know, I thought
you meant weed or something,

01:10:46.643 --> 01:10:48.876
I didn't think fuel was PCP.

01:10:48.878 --> 01:10:50.278
I didn't even know that
shit was still around.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.769
- Yeah, it isn't.

01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:53.259
You've gotta drive all the
way down in New York City

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.749
and go into to
Harlan to pick it up.

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:59.354
I know a guy who makes a
trip every couple weeks.

01:10:59.356 --> 01:11:01.389
So, um, do you
mind if I throw it

01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:04.692
in your freezer
when we get there?

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:08.563
- Ah.

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:09.697
- Nah, go for it, I guess.

01:11:13.336 --> 01:11:15.803
(soft music)

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:21.402
- [Shannon] And it's not,
god, it's not like that.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.640
You're totally tripping
out over nothing.

01:12:25.642 --> 01:12:28.776
Like we can talk
being out tomorrow.

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:29.644
(Shannon sighs)

01:12:29.646 --> 01:12:30.778
It's my dad.

01:12:32.549 --> 01:12:34.048
(Shannon sighs)

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:37.518
I know, I know it
wasn't cool, I know.

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:39.754
No, I'm not high.

01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:42.357
Ah, shut up.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.127
Dude, you're like, just...

01:12:46.129 --> 01:12:47.612
I can't talk right now.

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:49.096
I can't do this shit right now.

01:12:49.099 --> 01:12:51.866
I got too much on my,
on my plate, dude.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:54.068
You gotta go, I gotta go.

01:12:54.904 --> 01:12:55.837
(Shannon sighs)

01:12:55.839 --> 01:12:57.405
Yeah, fuck off.

01:12:57.407 --> 01:13:00.775
(footsteps approaching)

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:04.612
You hear from your friend?

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:05.913
- Nah, not yet.

01:13:08.651 --> 01:13:10.051
Something wrong?

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:13.454
- Nah, it's just this guy.

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:16.424
(sighs)

01:13:16.426 --> 01:13:17.792
We used to date.

01:13:17.794 --> 01:13:19.026
Kinda, but...

01:13:22.399 --> 01:13:24.532
We're suppose to meet up

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:26.666
and smoke the rest of
this bag later, but.

01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:28.436
- You don't wanna?

01:13:28.438 --> 01:13:29.771
- I don't know.

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:32.940
He can just be real
creepy sometimes

01:13:32.942 --> 01:13:36.411
and I don't know if I
wanna hang out with him

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:38.479
when I'm all fucked up.

01:13:40.116 --> 01:13:42.634
- Then don't go.

01:13:42.635 --> 01:13:45.153
- Well, I mean I don't know,
it might not be that bad.

01:13:45.155 --> 01:13:48.556
I don't wanna smoke
it all by myself.

01:13:49.859 --> 01:13:53.060
- You wanna, you
wanna smoke it here?

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:55.863
- Really, you don't mind?

01:13:55.865 --> 01:13:57.865
- No, it's cool.

01:13:57.867 --> 01:13:58.866
- Okay.

01:14:05.642 --> 01:14:08.109
(door shuts)

01:14:09.879 --> 01:14:12.113
Thank you, man, you're
a real lifesaver.

01:14:12.115 --> 01:14:14.682
This guy's a real weirdo.

01:14:14.684 --> 01:14:15.917
Last time I hung out with him,

01:14:15.919 --> 01:14:17.652
he spotted me some money for gas

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:19.554
and that just means that
the next time I see him,

01:14:19.556 --> 01:14:22.824
he's gonna try to swing that
in some weird favor, you know.

01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:25.827
You know like we didn't
even do anything crazy ever.

01:14:25.829 --> 01:14:29.096
He just, he's always
trying something.

01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:33.901
We only dated for
like a minute and...

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:35.102
I don't know.

01:14:35.104 --> 01:14:39.140
It's just real
annoying to be around.

01:15:17.113 --> 01:15:18.112
Thank you.

01:15:24.153 --> 01:15:25.186
- Hey, be careful.

01:15:25.188 --> 01:15:27.188
- [Shannon] Oh shit, sorry.

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:29.257
Now what were we talking about?

01:15:29.259 --> 01:15:32.093
Oh, yeah, that, that douche bag,

01:15:32.095 --> 01:15:33.961
yeah, he's a weirdo.

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:38.566
You ever been on
a duck boat tour?

01:15:38.568 --> 01:15:42.069
- Ah, nah, I've seen
'em around though.

01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:43.804
- Yeah, one time my
dad brought me up,

01:15:43.806 --> 01:15:45.873
out to Boston on one of
those duck boat tours

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:48.809
and I really wanted
to see the ducks

01:15:48.811 --> 01:15:49.911
and ah, I didn't know there was

01:15:49.913 --> 01:15:52.647
some floating car tour, so ah,

01:15:55.585 --> 01:15:56.851
you can imagine I
was pretty pis--

01:15:56.853 --> 01:15:58.286
- Shannon, watch out.

01:15:58.288 --> 01:16:00.688
- Relax, man, she's fine.

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:05.726
I mean people always feel
like they gotta say something

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:07.995
or they gotta do
something, do something,

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:09.030
we're like no.

01:16:09.032 --> 01:16:10.598
(chuckles)

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:12.165
Ah, do something when
people say things

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:14.802
or a, they don't, people
don't think to think

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:16.604
to think about themselves.

01:16:16.606 --> 01:16:17.972
- Hey, come on, you're
gonna hurt Sadie.

01:16:17.974 --> 01:16:18.873
You can't sit there.
(dog barks)

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:19.807
- Can't sit where?

01:16:19.809 --> 01:16:20.900
- In the chair.

01:16:20.901 --> 01:16:21.992
- [Shannon] What chair?

01:16:21.993 --> 01:16:23.084
- The one you were
just sitting in.

01:16:23.085 --> 01:16:24.176
- [Shannon] It's yours?

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:25.846
- Let's go for a walk somewhere.

01:16:25.848 --> 01:16:28.082
- [Shannon] You can't
tell me what to do.

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:29.500
- What?

01:16:29.501 --> 01:16:30.917
- What are you a
dictator or something?

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.055
- What are you,
what are you saying?

01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:37.291
- Derek, Derek, Derek, Der.

01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:46.000
I'm stuck.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:51.856
I'm stuck.

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:52.673
- Are you fucking with me?

01:16:52.675 --> 01:16:55.142
(dog growls)

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:00.781
Shannon.

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:06.587
I don't wanna be stuck.

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:08.054
Am I gonna be stuck?

01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:09.924
This looks horrible.

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:12.059
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:17:12.061 --> 01:17:14.161
Ah, aah, what the fuck?

01:17:24.907 --> 01:17:26.974
Okay, Sh, Shannon, I'm gonna,

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:28.976
I'm gonna unstick you.

01:17:42.058 --> 01:17:43.391
Okay, on three.

01:17:45.662 --> 01:17:47.061
One, two, three.

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.199
Fuck.
(dog barking)

01:17:52.201 --> 01:17:54.935
Shannon, Shannon,
Sha, Sha, Shannon.

01:17:54.937 --> 01:17:55.903
(Shannon groaning)

01:17:58.741 --> 01:17:59.857
Fuck.

01:17:59.858 --> 01:18:00.974
Come on, Shannon, Shannon.

01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:02.677
Shannon.
(dog barking)

01:18:02.679 --> 01:18:05.346
(intense music)

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:46.887
(unsettling music)

01:20:11.007 --> 01:20:14.008
(phone vibrating)

01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:17.478
- Yo.

01:20:21.517 --> 01:20:23.918
Slow down, what happened?

01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:28.088
(melancholy music)

01:20:42.572 --> 01:20:45.372
(rain patters)

01:21:52.608 --> 01:21:56.076
You can still catch
the end of it.

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:59.580
- No, I just wanna
sit here a bit longer.

01:22:09.992 --> 01:22:14.695
I've been thinking about
what you said the other day.

01:22:14.697 --> 01:22:16.096
- About what?

01:22:19.302 --> 01:22:20.935
- About eternity.

01:22:23.639 --> 01:22:25.406
- I don't know why the
fuck you listen to me for.

01:22:25.407 --> 01:22:27.174
I don't what the fuck
I'm talking about.

01:22:27.176 --> 01:22:29.944
- No, man, what if she's right?

01:22:32.982 --> 01:22:35.449
What if this is all there is?

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:38.485
And there's just nothing.

01:22:41.624 --> 01:22:45.259
- I guess that mean every
second you spent with her

01:22:45.261 --> 01:22:47.661
means that much more, right?

01:22:53.402 --> 01:22:55.536
(cries)

01:23:06.983 --> 01:23:11.251
You know, the North Star
wasn't always the North Star?

01:23:14.557 --> 01:23:18.392
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:23:18.394 --> 01:23:22.663
- North Star, it changes
every couple thousand years.

01:23:26.068 --> 01:23:28.168
Before we had this one,
there was another one,

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:31.405
and before that one,
there was another one.

01:23:31.407 --> 01:23:35.376
In a couple thousand years,
there'll be another one.

01:23:35.378 --> 01:23:38.779
It's gonna keep going
like that forever.

01:23:40.282 --> 01:23:41.682
Both directions.

01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:48.155
- What does that have
to do with anything?

01:23:51.694 --> 01:23:53.594
- So you can talk
about this shit,

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:55.495
you gotta realize that
the amount of time

01:23:55.498 --> 01:23:57.664
we got is so fucking
small, it's microscopic,

01:23:57.666 --> 01:24:00.434
it's smaller than that, it's...

01:24:01.737 --> 01:24:04.738
We're talking about
infinity, man.

01:24:07.443 --> 01:24:09.777
- So what are you saying,

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:12.112
that a, we're so fucking
small and insignificant

01:24:12.114 --> 01:24:13.430
that none of this
really matters?

01:24:13.431 --> 01:24:14.747
- That's not what I'm saying.
- That's what it

01:24:14.748 --> 01:24:16.064
sounds like.
- That's not what the fuck

01:24:16.065 --> 01:24:17.381
I said, I'm not saying that.
- and it ain't fucking helping

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:19.386
me out right now.
- Well, I'm not saying that.

01:24:19.387 --> 01:24:21.387
It just not what I'm saying.

01:24:21.388 --> 01:24:23.388
I'm saying that we're
only here for a moment

01:24:26.095 --> 01:24:28.562
and every part of that moment

01:24:29.765 --> 01:24:34.101
is specific to a certain
place and a certain time.

01:24:35.071 --> 01:24:36.603
It's not that we don't matter,

01:24:36.605 --> 01:24:40.741
it's the opposite, it's
every second of our life

01:24:42.711 --> 01:24:46.513
no matter how small,
no matter how painful,

01:24:48.084 --> 01:24:50.217
every second is special.

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:56.457
Every second is one in infinity.

01:25:13.843 --> 01:25:17.244
(gentle piano music)

01:25:32.528 --> 01:25:34.261
- Got any ideas?

01:25:34.263 --> 01:25:38.799
- [Darren] I was kinda
hoping you had something.

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:40.567
- Well, maybe we'll get
her a gift together,

01:25:40.569 --> 01:25:42.453
but it's gotta be a
good one or she'll think

01:25:42.454 --> 01:25:44.338
we got lazy and screwed
her out of her present.

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:45.405
- Isn't that what's happening?

01:25:45.407 --> 01:25:47.708
- Not if it's a good one.

01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:49.176
- How 'bout we get
her a gift card?

01:25:49.178 --> 01:25:51.245
- No, we can't get
her a gift card.

01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:53.313
We get her a gift card, we
might as well get her cash,

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:55.381
you get her cash you might as
well get her nothing at all.

01:25:55.384 --> 01:25:56.550
- How 'bout one of those
elliptical machines

01:25:56.552 --> 01:25:58.352
she's been talking about?

01:25:58.353 --> 01:26:00.153
- No, she'll make me use it.

01:26:01.757 --> 01:26:03.157
- You know what?

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:04.558
We can get her one of
those, one of those vacuums

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.527
that cleans the floor by itself.

01:26:06.529 --> 01:26:07.628
- Those exist?

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:08.728
- Yeah, they got 'em
at the department store

01:26:08.729 --> 01:26:09.828
down the road.

01:26:09.832 --> 01:26:12.299
- What time they open til?

01:26:15.204 --> 01:26:16.703
- About another half hour.

01:26:16.705 --> 01:26:19.706
(doorbell chimes)

01:26:20.843 --> 01:26:22.093
- That a good idea.
(door shuts)

01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:23.344
Why don't you run up there
(footsteps approaching)

01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:24.595
and grab one.

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:25.846
And when you're done,
swing by and pick me up.

01:26:25.848 --> 01:26:27.214
- You sure?

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:28.581
Mom hasn't been letting
me drive the couple weeks.

01:26:28.584 --> 01:26:30.251
- No, I trust you.

01:26:30.252 --> 01:26:31.919
Just pick me up
when you're done.

01:26:31.921 --> 01:26:33.320
- Thanks dad.

01:26:37.459 --> 01:26:39.893
(doorbell chimes)
(door shuts)

01:26:39.895 --> 01:26:42.296
- What can I get for you?

01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:44.464
- Newports.

01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:56.677
- [Mitch] Any thing else?

01:26:56.679 --> 01:26:59.813
(soft piano music)
