01:10.612 --> 01:13.699
<i>...but in South America,
particularly Costa Verde,</i>

01:13.782 --> 01:17.077
<i>Bruno Diaz has been an icon for decades.</i>

01:17.160 --> 01:20.956
<i>He immediately made a name for himself
by ushering in the nation's first dealings</i>

01:21.039 --> 01:25.627
<i>with the United States in decades,
after years of turmoil had followed</i>

01:25.711 --> 01:29.548
<i>from the historically bloody
coup d'Ã©tat in 1953.</i>

01:29.631 --> 01:32.593
<i>But Mr. Diaz's efforts will finally
come to fruition,</i>

01:32.676 --> 01:35.512
<i>tomorrow morning
at a summit with the president,</i>

01:35.596 --> 01:39.391
<i>where the two dignitaries will sign
an agreement to lift the trade embargo.</i>

01:41.435 --> 01:44.229
<i>I'm told Mr. Diaz is about
to take the stage.</i>

01:44.313 --> 01:47.816
<i>Now, tomorrow's summit will take place
in Washington, D.C., but in seconds,</i>

01:47.900 --> 01:52.154
<i>Mr. Diaz will address the people
of Costa Verde about the historic event.</i>

01:52.237 --> 01:54.907
<i>We'll take you there now, live.</i>

02:13.383 --> 02:14.927
<i>I'm just getting this now.</i>

02:15.010 --> 02:18.388
<i>We have a reporter on the ground,
but they are evacuating the area.</i>

02:18.472 --> 02:22.768
<i>It appears Bruno Diaz has been shot.</i>

02:24.102 --> 02:26.897
<i>This is a shocking turn of events.</i>

02:53.465 --> 02:55.384
<i>Yes, sir, Mr. Secretary.</i>

02:55.467 --> 02:58.762
I assure you, we will find out
who's responsible.

02:58.846 --> 03:02.391
Understood. No, it will be totally covert.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.146
Yes, sir. Great. Thank you. Bye.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.315
Sir, you need to see this.

03:11.984 --> 03:15.571
A hair was recovered at the crime scene.
They have a positive ID.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.949
He flew in and out of Costa Verde
within hours of the attack.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.451
- Peterson!
- Yes, sir?

03:21.535 --> 03:24.288
We have our man.
Brandon Beckett is now our primary suspect.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.665
- Get a team over to Beckett's house stat.
- Local SWAT?

03:26.748 --> 03:29.501
Private. If it was one of our own
that killed a foreign dignitary,

03:29.585 --> 03:31.920
we need to keep it under wraps
until we know everything.

03:32.004 --> 03:34.715
Clover, keep digging,
find out everything you can.

03:34.798 --> 03:38.093
Peterson, when you locate Beckett,
I want a safe house set up somewhere nearby.

03:38.177 --> 03:39.136
- Okay.
- Let's move.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.097
Assume that Brandon Beckett is armed
and dangerous.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.611
Damn, Retcon. You son of a bitch.

03:55.694 --> 03:59.156
We're going on five days
and I'm still sweaty as hell.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.869
Oh, really?

04:03.952 --> 04:06.496
Unlike you, I actually have a real job.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.291
But I've got two more weeks
of vacation left, buddy.

04:09.374 --> 04:13.670
Two more weeks of beating
your little 13-year-old ass.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.673
Oh, 14.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.759
So sorry.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.427
Wait for it.

04:20.511 --> 04:21.512
Wait for it.

04:22.513 --> 04:23.347
Boom!

04:49.957 --> 04:53.043
That's what happens
when you don't clear the corner.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.753
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get some.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.811
On the ground!

05:10.894 --> 05:12.229
On the ground now!

05:12.312 --> 05:13.981
Step back!

05:15.023 --> 05:17.317
Hands up! Let's go!

05:17.401 --> 05:18.861
- We're clear.
- On your stomach!

05:18.944 --> 05:20.571
Get down on the ground now!

05:32.040 --> 05:33.250
Shit.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.753
Bravo team clear.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.463
Andrews!

05:39.464 --> 05:40.883
Let's go, move it.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.136
- He was taken.
- <i>What?</i>

05:44.219 --> 05:47.973
<i>It was critical
that his death look like a suicide.</i>

05:48.056 --> 05:50.142
What's plan B?

05:50.225 --> 05:54.563
<i>After being questioned, he'll be taken
to a high security facility for holding.</i>

05:54.646 --> 05:56.857
<i>I'll send a team to take out the convoy.</i>

05:56.940 --> 05:59.860
<i>It'll need to look like they're working
with Beckett.</i>

05:59.943 --> 06:01.361
<i>No one survives.</i>

06:43.111 --> 06:44.988
We know you killed Bruno Diaz.

06:47.199 --> 06:50.536
- What in the hell are you talking about?
- Don't bullshit me.

06:50.619 --> 06:55.457
We got your DNA, we have your flight records
and we have your motive.

06:55.541 --> 06:59.837
Now, what I want to know is,
was your father involved?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.714
My father? Was he involved in what?

07:02.798 --> 07:05.801
Your father was on a mission
in Costa Verde, things went bad,

07:05.884 --> 07:08.512
this is your way of getting even.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.514
Yeah, I read your stories in your e-mails.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.600
Look, I've obviously been set up.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.269
Where were you Tuesday?

07:15.352 --> 07:17.813
Seven thirty-two p.m.?

07:18.814 --> 07:20.315
I don't know.

07:20.399 --> 07:22.401
The gym? In bed?

07:22.484 --> 07:26.071
Sir, I'm on leave
for the first time in five years.

07:26.154 --> 07:30.450
With all due respect, I didn't even know
there was an assassination.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.619
Agent Franklin.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.790
Pardon the interruption.

07:36.874 --> 07:39.585
Can I have a word alone with Beckett?

07:41.420 --> 07:42.588
Who the hell called you?

07:43.589 --> 07:44.506
The colonel.

07:45.507 --> 07:48.177
I guess your short-sighted inability
to see through the red tape

07:48.260 --> 07:53.140
was a concern when dealing with someone
whose service record is as admirable

07:53.223 --> 07:55.559
as Sergeant Beckett's is.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.022
You got a minute.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.858
- How about five? Okay.
- How about one?

08:06.862 --> 08:08.780
Zeke Rosenberg, Homeland Security.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.282
You can call me Zero.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.701
Okay, Zero.

08:12.784 --> 08:16.038
Look, I had nothing to do
with whatever this is.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.956
I'm not gonna make a judgment on that.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.293
What I am gonna do is,
I'm gonna look at the facts

08:21.376 --> 08:24.254
and then I'll make my decision,
unlike Agent Franklin there,

08:24.338 --> 08:27.132
who seems to believe everything he reads.

08:27.216 --> 08:30.719
Now, listen. They're gonna move you
to a black site.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.472
If you're guilty,
it's gonna get really ugly.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.097
But if you're innocent,

08:35.182 --> 08:40.102
whoever did this is gonna want to tie up
loose ends, and that's not so good either.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.315
I promise you,
I will get to the bottom of this.

08:44.316 --> 08:45.692
Thank you.

08:45.776 --> 08:48.111
Don't thank me yet,
I might find out you're guilty.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.280
I'm not.

08:51.365 --> 08:54.159
- I hope that's true.
- All right.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.995
Time's up.

08:57.079 --> 08:59.456
Get him up and out of here, let's go.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.897
Rosenberg, I have strict orders
to keep a low profile,

09:23.981 --> 09:29.027
so I don't need you out there swinging
your big badge, blowing my cover.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.737
You got me?

09:30.821 --> 09:32.865
I have my orders too.

09:32.948 --> 09:37.327
Don't worry, I know they only drag you
out of the basement if it's a big deal.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.005
Okay.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.632
Let's get to work.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.028
Yeah?

10:12.321 --> 10:15.199
Okay. We need money up front.

10:16.325 --> 10:19.494
Loud helicopter behind you.
I will repeat, money up front.

10:22.414 --> 10:23.749
Not the helicopter?

10:24.750 --> 10:29.254
Perhaps it is my accent. I will repeat
one more time, then I'm hanging up.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.423
Money up front.

10:33.342 --> 10:34.968
Very good.

11:09.294 --> 11:12.256
Franklin tells me
you're the one who ID'd Beckett.

11:13.257 --> 11:18.387
I wasn't working alone, but, yes, I tracked
his passport and found his e-mails.

11:18.470 --> 11:21.306
The ones about his father going rogue
in Costa Verde?

11:21.390 --> 11:24.142
It's a bit more complicated
than that, but yes.

11:24.226 --> 11:26.812
Oh, it's a lot more complicated than that.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.690
- Or it's the truth.
- I'm not ruling that out.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.818
But a man that I respect very much
doesn't think so.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.113
I can appreciate that.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.783
But we need more than your friend's hunch
to overturn this concrete evidence.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.870
However respected he may be.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.415
You're right.

11:50.127 --> 11:53.213
Why don't you pull up the video
of the assassination.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.180
The immediate area was
under heavy surveillance.

12:02.181 --> 12:05.058
Based off the trajectory
and size of the exit wound,

12:05.142 --> 12:10.230
ballistics was able to create a simulation
that narrows the shot to this vantage point.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.613
Over a mile away.

12:18.655 --> 12:23.035
Only someone with Beckett's skill set
could plan and pull off this shot.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.912
We're in agreement there.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.873
Now, who's that guy?

12:33.754 --> 12:38.383
Donald South, CEO of Novasil Pharmaceutical.

12:41.762 --> 12:45.974
Jose Lucas, Gabriel Machado, Maria Garcia.

12:46.058 --> 12:48.977
This guy, I don't remember his name,
but he is the Minister of Energy.

12:49.061 --> 12:51.855
These are all politicians.

12:53.690 --> 12:57.611
So, what is a big pharma CEO doing up
on that stage?

13:00.030 --> 13:01.990
It's a good question.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.124
Rodeo time.

14:09.183 --> 14:11.143
<i>You're not there to pull the trigger.</i>

14:11.226 --> 14:13.937
<i>We don't need a second gunman conspiracy.</i>

14:14.980 --> 14:17.816
<i>Just make sure the Russians do their job.</i>

14:17.900 --> 14:21.028
<i>Clean up only as a last resort.</i>

15:14.540 --> 15:16.792
- Hey, something's wrong.
- Shut up.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.432
- Shit.
- Go, go, go!

15:32.516 --> 15:34.142
Let's get out of here!

17:02.564 --> 17:04.900
Give me the key to the cuffs
so I can help you!

19:22.412 --> 19:23.539
Shit.

19:47.729 --> 19:50.440
Donald, Donald, Donald.

19:50.524 --> 19:54.194
That does not look like the picture
of your wife in my reports.

20:03.412 --> 20:04.705
Thank you.

20:12.838 --> 20:15.674
Excuse me, Mr. South,
before you get too comfortable here,

20:15.757 --> 20:17.801
- may I have a word?
- Sorry, this isn't the time.

20:17.885 --> 20:21.305
- Call my secretary to make an appointment.
- Okay, will do.

20:21.388 --> 20:24.308
Is he free on Tuesday afternoon?

20:24.391 --> 20:27.644
- Who are you?
- I'd hate to have to flash my credentials

20:27.728 --> 20:30.772
and make more of a scene
than I already have.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.151
Can you give us a minute?

20:36.862 --> 20:39.281
That's great, thank you.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.910
Your daughter's very pretty.

20:42.993 --> 20:45.996
Hi, I am Agent Rosenberg, Homeland Security.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.915
A couple questions,
then I'll be out of your hair.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.583
What's this about?

20:49.666 --> 20:51.960
I think you know. Bruno Diaz.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.589
See, here's the thing.

20:55.672 --> 20:58.383
I want to know what a corporate CEO
of a pharmaceutical behemoth

20:58.467 --> 21:01.845
was doing on-stage during a speech
about trade relations.

21:01.929 --> 21:04.389
Pharmaceuticals are one
of our nation's leading exports.

21:04.473 --> 21:08.268
Sure, but I didn't see anybody from
the gas companies up there with politicians.

21:08.352 --> 21:12.147
Are you accusing me of being involved
in the assassination of Mr. Diaz?

21:12.231 --> 21:14.733
No, no, no. I just want to know
what you were doing there.

21:15.734 --> 21:19.196
I was in attendance because I've been
an advocate for lifting the embargo.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.365
I'm a personal friend of the trade minister.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.908
I look forward to what the future will hold

21:22.991 --> 21:25.661
in finally being able to do business
with Costa Verde.

21:25.744 --> 21:28.956
"Personal friend."
His death must've been hard on you.

21:29.957 --> 21:31.333
Very.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.460
How about professionally?

21:34.920 --> 21:37.506
Did I stand to gain?
Are you kidding me? This is killing us.

21:37.589 --> 21:39.466
With the embargo lifted,
our stocks should've soared

21:39.550 --> 21:41.635
before our merger with Phykus Industries.

21:42.636 --> 21:44.888
Novasil Pharm is being absorbed
by another company?

21:46.306 --> 21:47.558
Lord help us.

21:47.641 --> 21:50.727
Does Homeland Security not have access
to Google?

21:52.646 --> 21:54.731
We were weeks away from the merger.

21:55.732 --> 21:58.902
Follow the money.
Someone didn't want to pay full price.

21:58.986 --> 22:01.321
Are you saying
Phykus had something to do with this?

22:04.283 --> 22:05.492
Follow the money.

22:06.535 --> 22:11.748
Phykus Industries, a Vancouver-based company
that has a relationship with Costa Verde,

22:12.875 --> 22:16.795
is weeks away from buying my company,
a small fish.

22:16.879 --> 22:20.299
Lifting the embargo would've turned us
into a shark.

22:32.603 --> 22:35.772
- Not now, Peterson.
- This is urgent, sir.

22:36.773 --> 22:40.194
Beckett's transport appears
to have been attacked.

22:40.277 --> 22:43.697
There was a large wreck
just outside of Olympia, and...

22:43.780 --> 22:46.742
One of our contractors was
among the deceased.

22:46.825 --> 22:50.537
- What about the other two?
- Missing, with Beckett and the vehicle.

22:50.621 --> 22:53.373
Oh, Jesus Christ. So he's not working alone.

22:53.457 --> 22:55.834
Someone broke him out of our custody.
Do we know who?

22:55.918 --> 22:58.253
Along with our man,
there were four more bodies.

22:58.337 --> 23:00.964
They appear to have Russian mob involvement.

23:01.048 --> 23:02.883
He's working with the Russians?

23:02.966 --> 23:04.676
We are trying to find the connection...

23:04.760 --> 23:08.430
I think the connection's on the side
of the goddamn road, no?

23:08.514 --> 23:11.225
Well, not exactly. There... There's more.

23:12.226 --> 23:16.230
Our man was killed with a long-range bullet,
not by the man on the scene.

23:16.313 --> 23:18.649
- A sniper.
- Yes, sir.

23:19.650 --> 23:21.068
His father.

23:21.151 --> 23:23.904
- I... I couldn't say, sir.
- I could.

23:26.031 --> 23:29.826
Okay, heads up!
Thomas Beckett is now a priority.

23:29.910 --> 23:32.663
It seems
his son Brandon isn't working alone.

23:32.746 --> 23:34.665
He has our vehicle
and two of our contractors,

23:34.748 --> 23:36.458
possibly as hostages.

23:36.542 --> 23:37.835
Sir.

23:37.918 --> 23:40.504
The SUV transporting Beckett was
just reported dumped

23:40.587 --> 23:42.506
at an abandoned lumber mill in Aberdeen.

23:43.757 --> 23:47.010
The other men were still in the car,
deceased.

23:47.094 --> 23:51.723
Okay, he's on foot, he can't get far,
so let's highlight Aberdeen, Washington.

23:51.807 --> 23:56.895
That means traffic cameras, ATM cameras,
cell phone traces, the whole works.

23:56.979 --> 23:59.898
Let's find him. Now.

24:34.141 --> 24:37.978
Sir, step away from the vehicle,
nice and slow.

24:47.279 --> 24:50.324
I know you're just doing your job here,
but I can't let you bring me in.

24:50.407 --> 24:53.076
Quiet! On your knees.

25:28.820 --> 25:32.574
Get me the hell out of here
and I promise I won't hurt you.

25:32.658 --> 25:34.826
- Can you put that in the glove box?
- Just drive!

25:34.910 --> 25:36.995
All right, all right, shit!

25:45.587 --> 25:47.297
Hey, talk to me.

25:47.381 --> 25:49.716
<i>Beckett and our team were attacked.
He's on the loose.</i>

25:49.800 --> 25:51.385
<i>I can't keep helping you.</i>

25:51.468 --> 25:53.929
He's the number one suspect
in a political assassination

25:54.012 --> 25:56.849
who's now wanted
for killing three government contractors.

25:56.932 --> 25:59.351
<i>Or whoever set him up wants him dead.</i>

25:59.434 --> 26:01.770
Then why won't he bring himself in?

26:01.854 --> 26:04.231
He did. Sounds like it
almost got him killed.

26:06.775 --> 26:09.695
Whoever did this knew he was being moved.

26:09.778 --> 26:11.780
If I'm Beckett, I'm thinking
there's a mole in the department.

26:12.990 --> 26:17.244
<i>He's gonna stay as far away from this
as possible until this is all sorted out.</i>

26:17.327 --> 26:19.746
With Franklin running the show,
I'm his only hope,

26:19.830 --> 26:21.748
and I can't do this without you.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.377
What do you need?

26:25.460 --> 26:29.339
Did you look into the Phykus Novasil merger?
Find anything out of the ordinary?

26:29.423 --> 26:32.009
<i>Not much. One small red flag.</i>

26:32.092 --> 26:34.052
They had a security breach last month.

26:34.136 --> 26:36.513
An accounting employee tripped an alarm,

26:36.597 --> 26:39.558
trying to access an area
above his clearance level.

26:39.641 --> 26:41.101
<i>That's it?</i>

26:41.185 --> 26:44.938
Local P.D. arrived, but they were
turned away by the head of security.

26:45.022 --> 26:47.191
He wouldn't even let them in the building.

26:47.274 --> 26:49.234
Okay, well, that's something.

26:49.318 --> 26:51.028
What's this accountant's name?

26:51.111 --> 26:53.155
<i>Josh Strayhorn.</i>

26:53.238 --> 26:54.615
Josh Strayhorn.

26:55.616 --> 26:56.450
Okay.

26:57.451 --> 27:00.829
- Keep digging. I'll keep you posted.
- <i>What are you gonna do?</i>

27:01.830 --> 27:04.416
Well, guess I'm heading to Vancouver.

27:12.591 --> 27:13.842
Where have you been?

27:14.927 --> 27:18.222
I know we're slammed, but we still have
bathroom privileges, don't we?

27:18.305 --> 27:19.473
No.

27:19.556 --> 27:22.392
Brandon Beckett just escaped
from two police officers

27:22.476 --> 27:24.019
in an Aberdeen parking lot.

27:24.102 --> 27:25.646
He is now officially MIA.

27:25.729 --> 27:28.524
So until we find him, hold it.

27:45.207 --> 27:47.793
Okay. Get out.

27:48.836 --> 27:50.128
What?

27:56.885 --> 27:59.972
Start walking, don't turn around
until you hit that last road.

28:00.055 --> 28:02.891
Come on, man, I'm in this now.
I can help you.

28:04.393 --> 28:05.602
You've helped plenty.

28:05.686 --> 28:07.563
Dude, that closed exit wasn't my fault.

28:07.646 --> 28:10.232
- I mean, wasted, I...
- Kid! Just walk.

28:11.567 --> 28:14.778
Don't worry, I'll take good care
of your car here.

28:15.863 --> 28:16.697
All right.

28:17.698 --> 28:19.366
All right, well...

28:26.665 --> 28:28.083
Hey.

28:29.084 --> 28:30.711
Sorry, buddy.

28:55.694 --> 28:58.238
Drake Phoenix, head of security.

28:58.322 --> 29:00.240
What can I help you with today?

29:00.324 --> 29:02.034
Holy shit.

29:02.117 --> 29:04.036
Hi. I'm just here to pick up a prescription.

29:04.119 --> 29:08.457
Rosenberg, it's for my mom.
No, sorry. I'm just kidding. Hey.

29:09.499 --> 29:11.877
How about Josh Strayhorn, Accounting?

29:11.960 --> 29:14.546
- Can you help me find him?
- Josh Strayhorn.

29:14.630 --> 29:17.049
Sadly, he's at home sick.

29:17.132 --> 29:19.927
- Hopefully I can help answer your questions.
- Perhaps.

29:20.010 --> 29:22.804
- Shall we go to your office?
- Is this gonna be long?

29:23.805 --> 29:26.725
I suppose that depends
on what you have to say.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.894
Mr. Strayhorn tripped
an alarm two weeks ago,

29:28.977 --> 29:31.313
trying to access a secure area.

29:31.396 --> 29:33.607
Right, I do remember that.

29:33.690 --> 29:35.776
And then the police showed up,
is that correct?

29:35.859 --> 29:39.571
Yeah, of course. That is protocol
when there's a security breach.

29:39.655 --> 29:42.783
However, this was just simply
a misunderstanding.

29:42.866 --> 29:46.245
May I ask why you're inquiring
into this minor incident?

29:46.328 --> 29:50.666
Well, whether or not it's a minor incident
remains to be seen.

29:50.749 --> 29:51.750
You see...

29:52.793 --> 29:55.879
I have reason to believe
that Mr. Strayhorn may have been involved

29:55.963 --> 29:58.090
with the assassination of Bruno Diaz.

30:04.429 --> 30:07.599
- That seems like a bit of a stretch.
- I know, I know.

30:07.683 --> 30:11.854
I've seen his picture. He looks like a guy
that likes to dress up and go to Comic Con.

30:16.191 --> 30:17.442
Exactly.

30:17.526 --> 30:20.028
But then again, so do I.

30:20.112 --> 30:21.989
So, you know...

30:25.784 --> 30:27.035
Well...

30:28.036 --> 30:30.539
What I can tell you is that on that night,

30:30.622 --> 30:34.001
Mr. Strayhorn left the office
with coworkers for drinks.

30:34.084 --> 30:38.005
After having a few too many,
he realized he left his wallet on his desk.

30:38.088 --> 30:41.466
When he returned, and not quite 100 percent,

30:41.550 --> 30:43.427
he got off the elevator on the wrong floor.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.179
It was a drunken accident.

30:46.305 --> 30:48.015
- Right?
- Right.

30:49.683 --> 30:51.894
Yeah, I see. I see.

30:51.977 --> 30:55.230
But how about that merger though, huh?

30:55.314 --> 30:58.525
I mean, absorbing Novasil Pharmaceuticals.

30:58.609 --> 31:01.361
Your workload is gonna double,
I would imagine.

31:01.445 --> 31:04.656
So does that mean your pay is gonna double?

31:04.740 --> 31:05.949
Not quite.

31:06.950 --> 31:10.037
Maybe more employees
to keep track of, really, but...

31:11.038 --> 31:13.707
daily routine stays about the same.

31:15.959 --> 31:16.960
Right.

31:17.044 --> 31:19.963
Well, thank you for your time, Mr. Phoenix.

31:20.047 --> 31:21.840
I'll be in touch.

31:27.721 --> 31:31.600
Listen to me. That is not what we agreed on.

31:33.393 --> 31:35.062
- Sir.
- I gotta call you back.

31:35.145 --> 31:38.273
A man just reported a carjacking
to Idaho State Police.

31:38.357 --> 31:43.445
He was taken from a parking lot in Aberdeen
where Beckett was last seen.

31:43.529 --> 31:48.325
Okay, okay, he screwed up.
We find this car, we find Beckett.

32:18.939 --> 32:20.524
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:20.607 --> 32:22.317
Me again. What do you got?

32:22.401 --> 32:24.528
<i>Nothing new. Where are you?</i>

32:24.611 --> 32:26.488
Outside Josh Strayhorn's apartment.

32:26.572 --> 32:28.699
- What?
- <i>Yeah, they told me he was home sick.</i>

32:28.782 --> 32:30.534
<i>I thought it was bullshit.</i>

32:30.617 --> 32:32.536
<i>Turns out I was wrong.</i>

32:32.619 --> 32:35.122
- So you didn't talk to him?
- No, but I did talk to a guy

32:35.205 --> 32:37.124
named Drake Phoenix.

32:37.207 --> 32:39.126
<i>I'm not sure about this guy.</i>

32:39.209 --> 32:41.211
<i>Maybe see what you can find out about him.</i>

32:41.295 --> 32:43.672
- He's a ghost.
- That was fast.

32:43.755 --> 32:46.800
Last five years, I've got bank record,
social security, you name it.

32:46.884 --> 32:49.178
Right down to his goddamn Netflix account.

32:49.261 --> 32:51.680
Then poof, he disappears.

32:51.763 --> 32:54.516
- What the hell is this?
- I gotta go.

32:54.600 --> 33:00.480
Zero... Agent Rosenberg asked me to look
into a situation at Phykus Industries.

33:01.481 --> 33:04.276
Zero. Phykus Industries.

33:04.359 --> 33:06.069
Goddamn it, Clover.

33:06.153 --> 33:09.615
I told you I wanted you to focus on Beckett.

33:10.616 --> 33:12.242
Jesus Christ, where is Zero?

33:13.619 --> 33:14.912
I'm not sure.

33:17.080 --> 33:20.792
Listen, the next time he calls,
you patch him through to me.

33:20.876 --> 33:24.296
Now stay tracking Beckett
and stop with this shit.

33:24.379 --> 33:25.506
Do you understand?

33:25.589 --> 33:27.424
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

33:28.967 --> 33:31.595
Peterson, I'll be in my office.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.010
- Stop right there, buddy.
- Homeland Security.

34:12.094 --> 34:14.096
Why don't you take a bathroom break,
my friend.

34:14.179 --> 34:15.222
Yes, sir.

34:16.473 --> 34:18.934
Federal agent, I need a moment alone
with this patient.

34:19.016 --> 34:22.187
- You cannot be in here.
- This is a matter of national security.

34:22.271 --> 34:25.732
You'll give me and the patient this room
or I will have you both arrested.

34:25.815 --> 34:27.275
Do you understand me?

34:27.359 --> 34:30.612
- This patient is hours out of surgery.
- Yeah, I don't care. Wake him up.

34:30.696 --> 34:33.282
Sir, he could die.
I'm not about to have him wake up.

34:33.364 --> 34:36.034
He is a suspect in a political assassination

34:36.118 --> 34:38.495
and potentially responsible
for the deaths of three men.

34:38.579 --> 34:39.538
Now wake him up.

34:42.040 --> 34:45.335
- I can't, I'm sorry.
- Why do we have to do this the hard way?

34:45.418 --> 34:48.045
Wake him the fuck up, please.

35:21.413 --> 35:23.207
Jesus, Dad.

35:23.290 --> 35:24.625
I could've shot you.

35:25.667 --> 35:28.128
Yeah. But you didn't.

35:32.049 --> 35:35.844
Well, you don't look
like you're outfitted for fishing, so...

35:36.887 --> 35:38.472
What did you do?

35:40.766 --> 35:43.936
Look, I've been set up.

35:57.824 --> 35:59.868
Morning, sunshine.

36:08.544 --> 36:10.003
Who hired you?

36:16.176 --> 36:18.846
I'm not gonna ask nice this next time.
Who hired you?

36:18.929 --> 36:20.764
Doctor!

36:22.933 --> 36:24.351
Who fucking hired you?

36:25.519 --> 36:26.854
I don't know!

36:26.937 --> 36:28.647
He never told me his name!

36:28.730 --> 36:31.608
- We only talked on the phone!
- Please just let me stabilize him.

36:31.692 --> 36:33.777
Nah. Not till he's done talking.

36:33.861 --> 36:35.737
Who hired you?

36:40.576 --> 36:44.246
- I told you everything I know!
- I don't believe you. Give me something.

36:44.329 --> 36:47.749
Male, female, American, European, a sound.

36:47.833 --> 36:49.751
Come on, give me something!

36:52.004 --> 36:53.338
Scrambled voice!

36:53.422 --> 36:56.300
I couldn't hear because of his helicopter.

36:56.383 --> 36:58.135
I know nothing.

38:04.785 --> 38:08.288
But I only hunt squirrel with my left hand

38:08.372 --> 38:12.751
because it wouldn't be fair
or sporting otherwise.

38:13.836 --> 38:16.672
A missing finger isn't enough
of a handicap, huh?

38:17.673 --> 38:20.592
Hell, you've seen me shoot.

38:20.676 --> 38:22.845
This old boy's still got it.

38:24.429 --> 38:25.848
It's tough, Dad.

38:25.931 --> 38:28.642
I don't think I could've bounced back
from something like that.

38:28.725 --> 38:30.769
Nah, you could've.

38:31.979 --> 38:34.565
I'm sure you've gotten
your own battle scars.

38:35.607 --> 38:36.817
Oh, a few.

38:37.818 --> 38:40.195
I was in a knife fight in Calcutta once.

38:40.279 --> 38:43.699
I got a pretty gnarly scar
across the old thigh here.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.702
I don't want to see it.

38:46.785 --> 38:48.996
I don't want to show you.

38:50.330 --> 38:51.832
How about you?

38:51.915 --> 38:57.629
Any other scars or skeletons
from past missions?

39:01.133 --> 39:03.385
Well, yeah, there is...

39:04.428 --> 39:08.473
something I think about once in a while.

39:15.147 --> 39:17.274
It was the Nam.

39:19.818 --> 39:26.658
We were in the central highlands, smack-dab
right on the top of the Cambodian border.

39:27.701 --> 39:30.495
And our mission was to assassinate

39:30.579 --> 39:35.751
a particularly nefarious NVA tax collector
and any of his escorts

39:35.834 --> 39:38.378
that we might possibly be able to nail.

39:39.379 --> 39:41.340
My partner...

39:43.675 --> 39:45.552
and senior NCO,

39:45.636 --> 39:48.138
Sergeant Major Conrad...

39:49.806 --> 39:55.103
Well, we were all beyond exhaustion and...

39:57.814 --> 39:59.858
But he snapped.

40:04.947 --> 40:10.953
He decided he would order me to stay back
and then he would go in alone.

40:13.163 --> 40:15.666
I should've never let him do that.

40:18.168 --> 40:19.837
But he went in,

40:20.879 --> 40:24.007
his hands were rock steady,

40:25.008 --> 40:27.511
but his eyelids were just twitching.

40:28.554 --> 40:31.557
And he kept repeating this phrase.

40:36.854 --> 40:38.605
Whispering it.

40:41.942 --> 40:43.902
And he goes in.

40:46.238 --> 40:48.448
And then he comes out,

40:49.491 --> 40:54.204
arm twisted behind his back,
blood coming down his face.

40:55.330 --> 41:01.503
And behind him, the son of a bitch
that we were trying to assassinate.

41:01.587 --> 41:04.006
With a pistol stuck in his cheek.

41:05.048 --> 41:09.052
And he's yelling, "Beckett, take the shot!"

41:12.222 --> 41:14.600
This was long range.
I mean, they were together.

41:14.683 --> 41:16.518
I'm talking inches apart.

41:17.644 --> 41:21.440
I mean, I was pretty good back then,
but, God, I don't know what I was thinking.

41:21.523 --> 41:25.444
I guess it was just,
my emotion got the better of me, and I...

41:36.622 --> 41:39.041
So I shot my target.

41:40.792 --> 41:42.961
But I also got my good friend.

41:44.838 --> 41:46.465
Jesus.

41:49.927 --> 41:52.054
I never looked it up.

41:59.269 --> 42:01.438
I think it was Latin.

42:08.779 --> 42:09.905
Maybe from this angle.

42:09.988 --> 42:13.158
Have we located any more evidence?

42:16.745 --> 42:18.080
This pattern here.

42:20.707 --> 42:23.544
Agent Franklin. You don't mind
if I look around, do you?

42:24.586 --> 42:26.129
- I do.
- Sir.

42:29.716 --> 42:31.885
I found this in the bedroom.

42:32.928 --> 42:35.264
"If you ever want to have a beer."

42:35.347 --> 42:37.975
Coordinates. "Dad."

42:39.017 --> 42:41.186
That's where he's gotta be.
We need a team up there.

42:41.270 --> 42:43.480
Let's wrap it up,
let's head back to the safe house.

43:58.138 --> 43:59.306
- Hey.
- <i>Clover.</i>

43:59.389 --> 44:03.060
I need you to confirm that Drake Phoenix was
in Brandon's battalion.

44:03.143 --> 44:04.228
Back row, far right.

44:07.064 --> 44:08.815
You said "back row, far right"?

44:08.899 --> 44:11.026
- <i>I did, yeah.</i>
- And you're sure?

44:11.109 --> 44:13.570
<i>Yeah, I'm sure. Why, what's the problem?</i>

44:15.239 --> 44:18.492
It appears
that this is Sergeant Clark McConnell.

44:18.575 --> 44:21.411
He was wanted for war crimes.
Tortured a civilian.

44:21.495 --> 44:24.957
But he died in the line of duty
five years ago.

44:26.291 --> 44:28.877
<i>Who else do you think knows about this?</i>

44:32.047 --> 44:33.757
<i>We're gonna find out.</i>

44:33.841 --> 44:35.425
Okay.

44:43.934 --> 44:45.519
Brandon.

44:46.687 --> 44:47.813
How's your mother?

44:50.232 --> 44:51.733
Good.

44:54.736 --> 44:58.407
She ever tell you
that I used to check in on you?

44:59.700 --> 45:00.576
No.

45:01.577 --> 45:05.789
She always just used to say
that you were working.

45:06.832 --> 45:08.125
Yeah, well, I was.

45:09.168 --> 45:11.003
But I still checked in on you.

45:12.045 --> 45:15.465
Phone calls. Later, e-mails.

45:19.970 --> 45:23.390
But I... I should've done it in person.

45:32.858 --> 45:36.028
You know, Mom told me that you proposed.

45:37.029 --> 45:40.073
And she turned you down. Is that true?

45:47.497 --> 45:48.874
Yeah, I did.

45:49.917 --> 45:53.295
Three times. I proposed three times.

45:55.214 --> 45:56.507
Yeah.

45:56.590 --> 45:59.676
I just figured
she was making herself responsible,

45:59.760 --> 46:02.930
so I didn't take it out on you
or something, but...

46:04.097 --> 46:06.600
Well, whatever her answer was,

46:08.602 --> 46:10.562
I should've been around.

46:14.733 --> 46:16.235
It's okay.

46:17.277 --> 46:19.988
Hey, I can shoot.

46:21.031 --> 46:22.324
I owe that to you.

46:26.745 --> 46:28.288
What do you mean by that?

46:28.372 --> 46:31.500
You pictured my face on a target downrange?

46:34.127 --> 46:36.004
No, no, I...

46:37.506 --> 46:41.134
I... Actually, I always kind of pictured you
there with me.

46:42.594 --> 46:46.598
When I was a kid and Uncle Rick used
to take me out hunting, I'd...

46:46.682 --> 46:49.685
I used to pretend
that you were right there next to me,

46:49.768 --> 46:52.020
you know, giving me pointers.

46:55.774 --> 46:57.359
Jesus.

46:59.069 --> 47:00.946
I'm sorry.

47:06.869 --> 47:09.246
Well, we're here now, huh?

47:12.624 --> 47:14.168
Yeah.

47:15.252 --> 47:19.089
Just two knots on a log. Eh, kid?

47:36.023 --> 47:38.108
Mr. Strayhorn, hi.

47:39.109 --> 47:42.696
I have a question for you about an invoice.

47:46.116 --> 47:49.494
- Where's Drake Phoenix?
- I... I don't know. I don't know.

47:49.578 --> 47:50.829
He never showed up today.

47:50.913 --> 47:53.624
Yeah, that's what I heard.
That's why I'm asking you where he is.

47:53.707 --> 47:55.083
I don't know. Okay?

47:55.167 --> 47:57.294
I was sick yesterday,
and I haven't seen him since last Friday.

47:57.377 --> 47:59.213
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not.

47:59.296 --> 48:01.465
Bruno Diaz.

48:01.548 --> 48:03.467
Now, I know you sure
as hell aren't in charge.

48:03.550 --> 48:06.178
- Why don't you tell me who you work for.
- I don't work for anybody.

48:06.261 --> 48:09.097
I'm just an accountant.
I'm just an accountant.

48:09.181 --> 48:10.849
Talk.

48:12.100 --> 48:13.560
Okay, now. Okay.

48:13.644 --> 48:15.896
Phoenix. Phoenix is insane, all right?

48:15.979 --> 48:18.899
All right? I don't have anything
to do with this, I promise you.

48:18.982 --> 48:20.984
He forced me,
he threatened to kill my family...

48:21.068 --> 48:24.446
Forced you to do what?
Forced you to do what?

48:24.530 --> 48:27.950
- He said he was...
- Oh, for fuck's sakes.

48:28.033 --> 48:30.118
Get up, get up, you're fine.

48:31.161 --> 48:33.038
It's fine, okay? It's okay.

48:34.706 --> 48:36.542
It's gone. It's gone, okay?

48:37.584 --> 48:39.711
- Talk to me.
- Phoenix.

48:41.296 --> 48:45.300
Phoenix came in
with just this crazy plan, okay?

48:45.384 --> 48:49.930
To siphon millions off the merger
with Novasil, all right?

48:50.013 --> 48:53.475
If Costa Verde pulls the plug on
the trade agreement with the United States,

48:53.559 --> 48:55.727
right, Novasil stock plummets.

48:56.728 --> 48:59.690
The fluctuating price made it easy for me...

48:59.773 --> 49:02.067
Really, anyone in accounting
that knows what they're doing.

49:02.150 --> 49:04.444
...to just shave pennies on the dollar.

49:05.445 --> 49:07.781
Look, I refused to get involved,

49:07.865 --> 49:11.702
then he got physical
and threatened to hurt my wife.

49:11.785 --> 49:14.538
Is this why he didn't want the police there
when he tripped the alarm that night?

49:16.874 --> 49:19.126
I was setting up the offshore account.

49:19.209 --> 49:23.839
Okay, look, Phoenix...
Phoenix made me do this.

49:54.077 --> 49:56.079
Hey, you want some coffee?

49:57.456 --> 49:59.583
Nah, I'm good, Pops.

50:13.430 --> 50:15.557
Oh, we got company.

50:28.820 --> 50:33.492
Delta, proceed with caution. You're dealing
with two highly trained individuals.

50:36.578 --> 50:38.747
You better get out of here.

50:39.915 --> 50:40.749
Take that.

50:42.292 --> 50:44.253
It's locked and loaded.

50:57.224 --> 51:00.519
You follow this tunnel.
It'll take you outside of the perimeter.

51:00.602 --> 51:04.022
Once you get there, you'll see a path.
Take a heavy northeast on the path.

51:04.106 --> 51:06.900
Got it? It's a bit of a hike.

51:06.984 --> 51:09.403
You can take the man
out of the Marine Corps, but you can't...

51:09.486 --> 51:11.989
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. Come on. Go, go.

51:16.493 --> 51:17.786
Hello?

51:19.997 --> 51:23.333
It's Rosenberg, sir.
He wants to talk to you.

51:24.459 --> 51:26.587
All right, put him through.

51:26.670 --> 51:28.839
Can you bring it up there?

51:30.215 --> 51:33.677
<i>Approaching target now. Taking position.</i>

51:56.783 --> 52:00.412
Zero. What's going on?
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

52:00.495 --> 52:05.334
<i>Guess what. I just got a crying confession
that proves Brandon Beckett's innocence.</i>

52:05.417 --> 52:06.502
What are you talking about?

52:06.585 --> 52:10.255
<i>Send someone to Phykus headquarters
immediately to pick up Josh Strayhorn.</i>

52:10.339 --> 52:14.468
All of this is just to make money
on the merger with Novasil Pharm.

52:14.551 --> 52:17.304
<i>The accountant, he'll confess to everything.</i>

52:21.058 --> 52:23.936
Come on out. Hands up.

52:25.229 --> 52:27.940
<i>One target in sight.
Thomas Beckett confirmed.</i>

52:28.023 --> 52:31.276
<i>Other target, not known.</i>

52:31.360 --> 52:33.237
<i>Standing by.</i>

52:41.036 --> 52:42.996
All right, Delta. Stand down.

52:43.080 --> 52:44.998
<i>I repeat, Delta stand down.</i>

52:45.082 --> 52:46.250
<i>Standing down.</i>

52:48.252 --> 52:49.795
Got a shooter!

52:52.422 --> 52:53.549
Oh, my God.

52:53.632 --> 52:55.425
Shit!

52:57.177 --> 52:58.178
Cover right!

52:59.930 --> 53:01.890
<i>We do not have eyes on! Advise!</i>

53:01.974 --> 53:03.225
Jesus Christ.

53:04.351 --> 53:05.227
Zero!

53:05.310 --> 53:08.438
<i>Your innocent friend
just took out two of our guys.</i>

53:08.522 --> 53:09.565
<i>We're pinned down!</i>

53:09.648 --> 53:11.233
- Goddamn it!
- <i>What do we do?!</i>

53:13.819 --> 53:15.946
Check the tree line!

53:17.573 --> 53:19.825
- See anything?
- Nothing.

53:36.717 --> 53:37.676
Stay down.

54:26.099 --> 54:28.977
Oh, for God's sakes, Brandon.

54:29.061 --> 54:32.731
What part of "get the hell out of here"
don't you understand?

54:36.026 --> 54:37.611
Come on.

55:00.634 --> 55:02.803
What do you see, Dad?

55:05.556 --> 55:07.975
Because I see jack shit.

55:53.854 --> 55:55.564
Oh, bingo.

56:19.713 --> 56:21.924
Not fair.

56:22.758 --> 56:23.634
Come on.

56:24.635 --> 56:25.969
Take a shot.

56:26.970 --> 56:28.722
Expose yourself.

56:29.765 --> 56:31.558
I dare you.

57:17.688 --> 57:19.231
You're outgunned.

57:19.314 --> 57:21.275
I'm at home here in my own bedroom.

57:21.358 --> 57:22.734
I could wait all day.

57:25.320 --> 57:26.989
Fine.

58:02.733 --> 58:03.901
Damn it.

58:13.660 --> 58:17.372
I'll track him down the path,
you flank him over on the right.

58:17.456 --> 58:19.875
We'll get his back to the river
and then he's trapped.

58:19.958 --> 58:21.460
We have to take him alive.

58:21.543 --> 58:25.547
If he's the shooter that framed me,
I need to bring him in and find out why.

58:25.631 --> 58:27.132
Go.

01:01:10.921 --> 01:01:12.130
Easy.

01:01:17.678 --> 01:01:19.847
Put your weapon on the ground.

01:01:23.725 --> 01:01:25.519
Put your hands up.

01:01:59.511 --> 01:02:00.637
Mr. Phoenix?

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.892
Federal Agent Zeke Rosenberg,
could you come to the door please?

01:02:17.988 --> 01:02:20.657
Hey. I need you to 86
an alarm system for me.

01:02:20.741 --> 01:02:23.202
27 Milo Street.

01:04:17.065 --> 01:04:18.066
Yes.

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:30.412
"Brandon Beckett"?

01:04:31.413 --> 01:04:32.372
Clever.

01:04:55.854 --> 01:04:57.856
Water taxi.

01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:03.237
Duneberry, California.

01:05:05.697 --> 01:05:07.241
Okay.

01:05:14.665 --> 01:05:17.668
<i>Hello? This is Brandon Beckett.</i>

01:05:17.751 --> 01:05:19.670
Agent Franklin?

01:05:20.754 --> 01:05:21.713
What do you got?

01:05:22.714 --> 01:05:25.008
Holy shit.

01:05:25.092 --> 01:05:27.010
All right, pull him up.

01:05:30.514 --> 01:05:34.142
Sergeant Beckett, what do you say
we put an end to this now?

01:05:34.226 --> 01:05:36.353
<i>I would like that very much.</i>

01:05:36.436 --> 01:05:39.648
<i>This woman here killed these five men today.</i>

01:05:40.649 --> 01:05:43.569
<i>I'm convinced she set me up
for the trade minister's murder.</i>

01:05:43.652 --> 01:05:46.238
- See if you can pull an ID.
- I'm on it.

01:05:46.321 --> 01:05:49.741
Okay, listen to me, Beckett. Why don't
we sort all this out when you get here?

01:05:49.825 --> 01:05:51.618
<i>Yeah, we will.</i>

01:05:51.702 --> 01:05:54.580
- I'm heading in now.
- <i>That won't be necessary.</i>

01:05:54.663 --> 01:05:59.626
<i>I already have a second team en route.
You stay put, we'll do this the right way.</i>

01:06:02.254 --> 01:06:03.797
<i>We'll be here waiting.</i>

01:06:04.798 --> 01:06:06.758
Okay, listen to me, you let that team know

01:06:06.842 --> 01:06:10.053
that the suspect is there to comply
and waiting for their arrival

01:06:10.137 --> 01:06:11.680
but to proceed with caution.

01:06:11.763 --> 01:06:14.600
- Hey, Clover, where are we?
- Got it! Yuki Mifune.

01:06:14.683 --> 01:06:19.062
Multiple dealings with the yakuza,
where she goes by the handle Lady Death.

01:06:19.146 --> 01:06:22.774
Raised in a crime family,
all private sector, no military service.

01:06:22.858 --> 01:06:24.318
Okay, listen up.

01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:29.364
We need a connection
between Lady Death and Bruno Diaz.

01:06:29.448 --> 01:06:32.326
Okay, everyone now, let's go, we gotta move.

01:06:32.409 --> 01:06:33.744
Come on!

01:06:36.121 --> 01:06:39.374
Oh, my God, this is like the day
that never ends.

01:06:45.506 --> 01:06:47.883
- You two, check perimeter.
- Copy that.

01:06:48.926 --> 01:06:51.136
Let's get some more support around here.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.846
All the way around the back. Let's go.

01:07:00.562 --> 01:07:01.813
Excuse me.

01:07:01.897 --> 01:07:04.983
Hi there. How routine are these departures?

01:07:05.984 --> 01:07:08.403
Well, run on a cycle,

01:07:08.487 --> 01:07:10.864
keep all the islands serviced.

01:07:10.948 --> 01:07:13.242
We got more islands than boats, see.

01:07:14.326 --> 01:07:16.578
- It's clockwork.
- How about 3 and 6:30 p.m.?

01:07:16.662 --> 01:07:19.164
- Which island do you service then?
- Well, three.

01:07:19.248 --> 01:07:23.335
There's that one, that one and that one.

01:07:23.418 --> 01:07:25.087
Three.

01:07:31.093 --> 01:07:33.178
Russian said he heard a chopper.

01:07:33.262 --> 01:07:34.471
What's that you say?

01:07:34.555 --> 01:07:36.890
Do any of those islands have a helipad?

01:07:36.974 --> 01:07:39.476
Well, that one for sure.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:43.480
- Private residence. Big place.
- Yeah, I need you to take me there now.

01:07:43.564 --> 01:07:45.357
Like we were saying, 3 and 6:30.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.234
I don't have time
for a long-winded explanation.

01:07:47.317 --> 01:07:49.403
This is a matter of national security.

01:07:49.486 --> 01:07:50.654
So...

01:07:51.655 --> 01:07:54.825
for your old buddy Ben Franklin,
take me there now, please.

01:07:58.203 --> 01:07:59.037
Come on.

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:04.918
Okay.

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:32.738
Well, checks out.

01:08:32.821 --> 01:08:36.783
Homeland confirmed her flying in and out
of Costa Verde on the day of the attacks.

01:08:37.783 --> 01:08:41.955
She confessed, gave us the same name
Zero gave us in Vancouver.

01:08:44.917 --> 01:08:47.002
Look, I'm sorry.

01:08:47.085 --> 01:08:49.129
I know you've been through hell.

01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:53.175
Yeah. You were just doing your job,
Agent Franklin.

01:08:53.258 --> 01:08:54.885
Yeah.

01:08:58.095 --> 01:09:00.349
So, what do we know?

01:09:00.432 --> 01:09:02.975
Who wanted Bruno Diaz dead and why?

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:06.604
Agent Clover?

01:09:08.607 --> 01:09:09.608
Money.

01:09:09.691 --> 01:09:12.861
Framing an American for the death
of one of their public officials

01:09:12.944 --> 01:09:16.532
was guaranteed to stop
the trade agreement in its tracks.

01:09:16.615 --> 01:09:18.367
Excuse me.

01:09:20.661 --> 01:09:23.537
The consequences of which sent
the stock prices plummeting

01:09:23.622 --> 01:09:27.459
for an American pharmaceutical company
that was in the process of being absorbed.

01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:29.545
Enter this guy.

01:09:29.627 --> 01:09:30.629
Look familiar?

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.715
"Clark McConnell"?

01:09:33.799 --> 01:09:36.844
Back when you knew him.
Now he's Drake Phoenix.

01:09:36.926 --> 01:09:40.055
A mid-level employee looking
to make his fortune off the merger

01:09:40.138 --> 01:09:44.768
with some shady accounting,
compliments of this guy.

01:09:44.852 --> 01:09:47.020
Clark McConnell, he's dead.

01:09:47.104 --> 01:09:48.939
Not anymore.

01:09:50.314 --> 01:09:52.234
<i>Okay. Move her up. Radio in.</i>

01:09:55.362 --> 01:09:57.239
Agent Franklin,
the team's ready to move her.

01:09:57.322 --> 01:09:59.533
All right, good. Let's go.

01:10:06.039 --> 01:10:08.667
Wait. Where are you taking her?

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:12.462
The same max security you were headed to
until she interfered.

01:10:12.546 --> 01:10:14.006
Yeah, karma's a bitch.

01:10:19.261 --> 01:10:20.637
No.

01:10:20.721 --> 01:10:22.639
Keep her here. We can use her.

01:10:23.891 --> 01:10:26.185
Why the hell would I do that?

01:10:26.268 --> 01:10:30.647
We can use her
to flush out McConnell... Phoenix.

01:10:30.731 --> 01:10:33.775
Here's what you need to know
about that son of a bitch.

01:10:33.859 --> 01:10:37.321
When we were deployed, I watched him murder
a woman and burn down her store

01:10:37.404 --> 01:10:40.073
while we were doing recon
in a small village.

01:10:40.157 --> 01:10:43.243
He had nothing on her. She was innocent.

01:10:43.327 --> 01:10:45.495
So I reported him to our superior officer.

01:10:45.579 --> 01:10:47.664
But before they had a chance
to question him,

01:10:47.748 --> 01:10:49.625
he was killed in a battle.

01:10:49.708 --> 01:10:51.376
Supposedly.

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:54.630
- I saw the body with my own eyes.
- You saw a body?

01:10:54.713 --> 01:10:56.965
So this is about revenge?

01:10:57.049 --> 01:10:58.383
No.

01:10:58.467 --> 01:11:01.178
I agree with you. It's about money.

01:11:01.261 --> 01:11:05.140
Revenge is just why he's trying
to hang this on me.

01:11:07.434 --> 01:11:09.561
Her job is to kill me.

01:11:09.645 --> 01:11:11.897
Let's make him think
she's still out there trying.

01:11:13.148 --> 01:11:14.650
Have her call him.

01:11:14.733 --> 01:11:17.694
Tell him that she has me
and that she wants to make a delivery.

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.158
This will work.

01:11:23.242 --> 01:11:24.701
This better work.

01:11:25.786 --> 01:11:27.746
<i>This is Agent Peterson. Abort.</i>

01:11:27.829 --> 01:11:29.122
<i>I repeat, abort.</i>

01:11:29.206 --> 01:11:31.166
<i>Let's turn that convoy around.</i>

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:33.502
<i>Copy that. Returning to base.</i>

01:11:34.878 --> 01:11:36.713
<i>Okay, folks, flag on the play.</i>

01:11:36.797 --> 01:11:38.590
<i>Let's turn it around.</i>

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.772
Tell him you're delivering me in person,

01:12:35.856 --> 01:12:38.734
but you will not finish the job
until you've been paid.

01:12:38.817 --> 01:12:40.819
That's your play.

01:12:43.906 --> 01:12:46.825
I want full immunity.

01:12:48.577 --> 01:12:50.412
You'll be extradited to Japan

01:12:50.495 --> 01:12:53.498
where you're wanted
on three counts of first-degree murder.

01:12:53.582 --> 01:12:56.543
Now, what they do with you,
that's their business.

01:12:56.627 --> 01:13:00.797
Here in the U.S.,
your offenses will be expunged.

01:13:00.881 --> 01:13:02.424
It's the best you're gonna get here.

01:13:03.425 --> 01:13:07.012
We watched you murder five people,
and it's all on camera.

01:13:07.095 --> 01:13:09.223
Now help us.

01:13:11.517 --> 01:13:13.977
I'm supposed to kill you.

01:13:14.061 --> 01:13:16.438
He's not gonna believe it.

01:13:17.731 --> 01:13:19.566
Make him believe it.

01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:21.401
That's the only way this works.

01:13:21.485 --> 01:13:25.322
He has to trust you
or at least sense that you're pissed off.

01:13:25.405 --> 01:13:30.410
Look, this has gotten way more complicated
than it was ever supposed to be, right?

01:13:30.494 --> 01:13:32.079
Work that angle.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.040
Agent Clover.

01:13:48.929 --> 01:13:50.472
Undo the cuffs.

01:14:19.418 --> 01:14:21.587
<i>Is Beckett dead?</i>

01:14:23.964 --> 01:14:27.676
Hello, I repeat, is Beckett dead?

01:14:27.759 --> 01:14:29.344
<i>I have him.</i>

01:14:29.428 --> 01:14:30.971
<i>Alive.</i>

01:14:31.972 --> 01:14:33.307
That's not the deal.

01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:36.351
<i>I've killed 10 people
without seeing a penny.</i>

01:14:36.435 --> 01:14:38.979
<i>I'll give you Beckett
when you give me the money.</i>

01:14:39.062 --> 01:14:41.356
<i>You can kill him yourself.</i>

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.649
How can I trust you?

01:14:42.733 --> 01:14:44.776
<i>You have no choice.</i>

01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:47.905
<i>If you don't,
I will let Beckett come after you.</i>

01:14:47.988 --> 01:14:50.866
<i>I've done enough killing
for the debt I owe you.</i>

01:14:50.949 --> 01:14:53.660
You haven't paid your debt
if Beckett's still alive.

01:14:53.744 --> 01:14:57.372
When I order a steak,
I expect it to be cooked.

01:14:58.874 --> 01:15:00.751
I'm Japanese.

01:15:00.834 --> 01:15:02.628
We prefer raw fish.

01:15:12.137 --> 01:15:14.556
Bring Beckett.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.142
I'll send you the address.

01:15:37.496 --> 01:15:38.580
He bought it?

01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:42.125
I'm supposed to bring you to this address.

01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:46.880
All right, let's start prepping the team.

01:15:46.964 --> 01:15:49.758
She'll have an empty gun,
there's no way I'm sending her in loaded.

01:15:49.842 --> 01:15:52.135
- Sir, that is...
- End of story.

01:15:52.219 --> 01:15:55.389
You'll have breakaway cuffs, you'll also
have a full clip concealed on you

01:15:55.472 --> 01:15:57.975
in case the need for a firearm arises.

01:15:58.058 --> 01:16:01.436
If she makes a move that strikes you
as remotely out of the ordinary,

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.481
you get ahold of the team
and we'll extract you.

01:16:04.565 --> 01:16:06.900
You two are there to flush him out.

01:16:06.984 --> 01:16:09.486
We'll have a team in the perimeter
to make an arrest,

01:16:09.570 --> 01:16:11.321
and we'll have a sniper if the need arises.

01:16:11.405 --> 01:16:13.156
I'll do that.

01:16:14.199 --> 01:16:17.870
- With all due respect, sir, you're retired.
- No. No.

01:16:18.871 --> 01:16:23.000
You're sending my kid in as bait, unarmed?

01:16:24.042 --> 01:16:29.006
Then you goddamn well better believe
that I'll be the one taking that shot.

01:16:31.133 --> 01:16:32.426
Yes, sir.

01:16:33.552 --> 01:16:35.888
Okay, let's go.
Get her out of here. Let's move.

01:17:37.491 --> 01:17:39.952
Son of a bitch.

01:18:53.192 --> 01:18:54.818
Easy, Drake.

01:18:54.902 --> 01:18:58.447
We don't need another dead body,
especially not in my hot tub.

01:18:58.530 --> 01:19:01.742
I have another way to silence Mr. Rosenberg.

01:19:23.555 --> 01:19:24.765
<i>Okay, people.</i>

01:19:25.766 --> 01:19:27.601
<i>Showtime.</i>

01:19:28.810 --> 01:19:31.188
<i>Brandon and Lady Death have arrived.</i>

01:19:32.189 --> 01:19:34.566
<i>Tactical team standing by.</i>

01:19:44.076 --> 01:19:46.495
We need to take care of him.

01:19:47.496 --> 01:19:50.040
She'll be here with Beckett soon.

01:19:51.333 --> 01:19:53.710
You heard the man. Enough of this charade.

01:19:54.711 --> 01:19:56.380
Name your price, everybody has one.

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:00.342
Work with me.

01:20:00.425 --> 01:20:03.345
I'm offering you your life.

01:20:03.428 --> 01:20:07.558
I don't want to kill you, I'd rather deal
with money. I'm not a murderer.

01:20:07.641 --> 01:20:10.769
People are dead because of your money,
even if you didn't pull the trigger.

01:20:10.853 --> 01:20:13.313
It wasn't supposed to be like that,
I wanted what was fair.

01:20:13.397 --> 01:20:15.649
I spearheaded the whole merger with Phykus.

01:20:15.732 --> 01:20:19.027
I made it seem viable,
I did all the negotiations, it was my deal.

01:20:19.111 --> 01:20:21.822
And then I suddenly realized
as soon as they had us onboard,

01:20:21.905 --> 01:20:24.116
they had no need for two CEOs.

01:20:24.199 --> 01:20:27.452
As a businessman I understand that,
but as the architect

01:20:27.536 --> 01:20:29.329
of a thriving corporation,

01:20:29.413 --> 01:20:30.914
I don't.

01:20:31.915 --> 01:20:34.376
You see, if they're squeezing me out...

01:20:35.377 --> 01:20:36.962
I'm gonna take as much as possible.

01:20:37.045 --> 01:20:39.756
I mean, surely you understand that,
Mr. Zero.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:43.218
- Even if it means murdering innocent people?
- Innocent?

01:20:43.302 --> 01:20:45.512
Bruno Diaz is a monster.

01:20:45.596 --> 01:20:47.639
He had his fingers in more dirt
than I care to discuss.

01:20:47.723 --> 01:20:50.267
The world's a better place without him.

01:20:52.769 --> 01:20:56.440
One dead corrupt politician,
that's what I proposed.

01:20:56.523 --> 01:20:59.276
Now, as for your friend Brandon, that's...

01:20:59.359 --> 01:21:01.028
Mr. Phoenix's business.

01:21:01.111 --> 01:21:03.989
See, Mr. Phoenix is involved in the details.

01:21:04.072 --> 01:21:05.574
I'm more of...

01:21:06.575 --> 01:21:07.701
an idea man myself.

01:21:07.784 --> 01:21:13.707
You see, that is the key
to any successful enterprise: delegation.

01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:17.503
Mr. Phoenix says he can take care of Diaz,
and I don't ask any questions.

01:21:17.586 --> 01:21:22.090
When you delegate to a psychopath,
you still end up with blood on your hands.

01:21:44.363 --> 01:21:45.405
Hey.

01:21:46.406 --> 01:21:47.616
You gotta sell this.

01:21:53.163 --> 01:21:54.623
Here we go.

01:21:54.706 --> 01:21:56.083
Knock, knock.

01:21:58.877 --> 01:22:01.046
I turned Phoenix in for war crimes.

01:22:01.129 --> 01:22:03.173
What's his beef with you?

01:22:07.594 --> 01:22:10.347
I heard you say your debt was paid.

01:22:12.099 --> 01:22:15.394
I was paid to kill
his piece-of-shit brother.

01:22:16.395 --> 01:22:20.023
But his nephew got killed in the cross fire.

01:22:21.024 --> 01:22:22.484
I'm a pro.

01:22:23.485 --> 01:22:25.487
That can't happen.

01:22:37.416 --> 01:22:42.045
<i>Approaching the house.
I repeat, they are approaching the house.</i>

01:22:58.228 --> 01:23:00.731
Hello, Brandon. Recognize me?

01:23:04.651 --> 01:23:06.737
I don't have time for a reunion.

01:23:07.738 --> 01:23:12.701
You can relive your war days later,
after you pay me.

01:23:14.828 --> 01:23:17.664
Relive our war days?

01:23:18.957 --> 01:23:22.085
<i>I never told you
Beckett and I served together.</i>

01:23:23.337 --> 01:23:24.963
Get in here now.

01:23:26.423 --> 01:23:30.969
Why don't you come out here and get me
yourself, you worthless piece of shit?

01:23:37.434 --> 01:23:40.062
You've always underestimated me, Beckett.

01:23:41.355 --> 01:23:44.566
Get inside now.

01:23:49.363 --> 01:23:50.447
They're going in.

01:23:50.531 --> 01:23:53.951
All right, code blue. I repeat, code blue.

01:23:54.034 --> 01:23:58.163
She couldn't get him out.
Extract Beckett and take out Phoenix.

01:24:02.835 --> 01:24:04.461
Son of a bitch.

01:24:14.096 --> 01:24:17.224
<i>Shots fired! I repeat, shots fired!</i>

01:24:44.710 --> 01:24:46.295
<i>Delta, stand down.</i>

01:24:46.378 --> 01:24:49.840
<i>Stand down! Beckett has been taken hostage.</i>

01:24:51.633 --> 01:24:53.760
<i>Thomas, do you have a shot?</i>

01:24:53.844 --> 01:24:56.513
Negative.
They're grouped too close together.

01:25:00.475 --> 01:25:03.812
I want a chopper!
To take me and Beckett away.

01:25:05.647 --> 01:25:06.690
Come on.

01:25:14.072 --> 01:25:15.324
Hey.

01:25:16.325 --> 01:25:20.204
Hey! Untie me.
I'm a federal agent, I can help you.

01:25:21.205 --> 01:25:24.750
Come on, you help me, I'll help you.

01:25:24.833 --> 01:25:26.376
Yeah?

01:25:32.966 --> 01:25:36.386
I want a chopper
to take me and Beckett out of here!

01:25:37.429 --> 01:25:42.643
And I want $10 million
or Beckett dies right now!

01:25:43.644 --> 01:25:47.272
<i>Thomas, we need you
to take a goddamn shot now.</i>

01:25:47.356 --> 01:25:48.482
<i>Do you have a shot?</i>

01:25:48.565 --> 01:25:49.900
Negative.

01:25:50.901 --> 01:25:52.653
I got too much wind, it's downrange.

01:25:52.736 --> 01:25:55.614
<i>I don't give a shit about the wind.
Take the shot!</i>

01:25:56.615 --> 01:25:58.283
Come on.

01:25:59.535 --> 01:26:00.702
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

01:26:01.703 --> 01:26:04.748
<i>Do you have a shot, Thomas? Take it.</i>

01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:08.752
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

01:26:08.836 --> 01:26:10.963
<i>Do you have a shot?</i>

01:26:11.964 --> 01:26:15.551
<i>Do you have a shot?</i>

01:26:35.362 --> 01:26:36.488
<i>What?</i>

01:26:37.489 --> 01:26:39.324
What the hell are you saying?

01:26:40.367 --> 01:26:43.495
<i>The past is the past.</i>

01:26:45.914 --> 01:26:47.708
Not for me, it's not.

01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:50.502
You ruined my life.

01:26:52.421 --> 01:26:54.673
<i>You did what you had to do,</i>

01:26:54.756 --> 01:26:57.885
<i>just like you're gonna do right now.</i>

01:26:57.968 --> 01:27:00.929
Thomas, we need you to find a shot.

01:27:01.013 --> 01:27:03.307
<i>Goddamn it, take the shot!</i>

01:27:06.977 --> 01:27:08.645
I trust you.

01:27:16.653 --> 01:27:18.197
Who the hell are you talking to?

01:27:20.115 --> 01:27:21.325
My dad.

01:27:45.891 --> 01:27:47.518
Okay.

01:27:48.810 --> 01:27:50.979
All right, let's wrap this up.

01:27:51.063 --> 01:27:52.981
Great job, Delta.

01:28:11.792 --> 01:28:14.044
Not so fast, South.

01:28:25.889 --> 01:28:26.890
It's over.

01:28:38.402 --> 01:28:40.988
All clear at the fence. Let's go.

01:28:51.832 --> 01:28:53.166
Thank you.

01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:55.752
Thanks for getting the job done.

01:28:56.879 --> 01:28:58.881
Actually, she did.

01:29:13.145 --> 01:29:15.105
I'll see you around, Zero.

01:29:33.081 --> 01:29:34.750
My God.

01:29:34.833 --> 01:29:38.462
That was the hardest shot
I ever had to make.

01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:50.307
I never doubted you for a second,
Master Guns.

01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:53.810
Oh, yeah?

01:29:53.894 --> 01:29:55.729
Well, I did.

01:29:58.774 --> 01:30:02.945
- What do you say we go get those beers now?
- Yeah, crack a couple of cold ones.

01:30:28.929 --> 01:30:32.349
They tell me you've been cooperating.

01:30:36.019 --> 01:30:37.771
Eight confirmed kills.

01:30:37.855 --> 01:30:41.692
1.2 mile shot from a 30-story window.

01:30:43.235 --> 01:30:49.324
And you helped me catch the bad guy.

01:30:53.495 --> 01:30:58.041
Well... looks like you missed your flight.

01:30:59.459 --> 01:31:01.253
Let me introduce myself.

01:31:01.336 --> 01:31:06.258
Lady Death, my name is Zero.
