<i>Narrator: Previously on
"Switched at Birth"... </i>

00:02.079 --> 00:03.012
- Is this Carlton?
- Ah, you know it?

00:03.114 --> 00:04.046
- I just started teaching there.
- No way!

00:04.148 --> 00:05.915
Your mom and her white boyfriend

00:06.016 --> 00:07.350
think they're gonna bulldoze in here,

00:07.441 --> 00:09.096
make lofts and places for brunch.

00:09.102 --> 00:10.303
She's not working for him anymore.

00:10.404 --> 00:12.905
- I got my job back.
- On the East Riverside project?

00:13.006 --> 00:15.508
Are you determined to get yourself hurt?

00:15.609 --> 00:18.143
I invited a new member
of the chamber of commerce

00:18.244 --> 00:20.713
and he's got a great deal
of interest in your project.

00:20.814 --> 00:24.016
- Chip Coto. Great to meet you.
- And you.

00:24.117 --> 00:26.551
The guy is a total sleaze. And I
don't know what he's trying to pull

00:26.652 --> 00:28.887
- with this whole construction-company thing.
- Do you want to take a stand

00:28.988 --> 00:30.889
or do you want to make things
better for East Riverside?

00:30.990 --> 00:32.591
All of this, like, "we want
to save East Riverside!"

00:32.692 --> 00:34.345
Just admit it... it's for him.

00:34.593 --> 00:36.094
(Tires squeal)

00:36.295 --> 00:37.530
There's been an accident.

00:37.631 --> 00:40.198
His C.T. scan showed a
ruptured cerebral aneurysm.

00:40.299 --> 00:44.202
Typical causes are
stress, anxiety, anger...

00:44.303 --> 00:45.671
- Did you say anger?
- Yes.

00:45.772 --> 00:49.641
- Are you okay?
- This is all your fault.

00:49.742 --> 00:51.543
- Do you know about Francesca?
- Who's Francesca?

00:51.644 --> 00:52.644
Angelo's older sister.

00:52.745 --> 00:55.514
She was 18 when she
died of an aneurysm too.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.920
(Typing)

01:03.321 --> 01:04.921
_

01:07.288 --> 01:10.702
_

01:12.435 --> 01:14.069
Hi, hon.

01:14.170 --> 01:16.538
Tackling your homework already? Way to go.

01:16.639 --> 01:19.041
Um, I was checking out celebrity gossip.

01:19.142 --> 01:20.842
Ooh, that Justin Bieber.

01:20.943 --> 01:22.577
Since when do you care about Justin Bieber?

01:22.678 --> 01:25.747
I was checking out other art schools.

01:25.848 --> 01:27.482
That's great.

01:27.583 --> 01:30.752
Honey, we just don't want to see
you lose momentum and flounder.

01:30.853 --> 01:32.921
What, like Toby?

01:33.021 --> 01:35.089
Speaking of your brother, honey,

01:35.190 --> 01:37.891
could you do me a huge favor
and take this over to Toby's?

01:37.993 --> 01:39.760
It's his favorite...
chicken enchilada casserole.

01:39.861 --> 01:42.796
350°F for 30 minutes.

01:42.897 --> 01:46.533
This is what floundering tastes like.

01:46.634 --> 01:48.970
(Video game gunfire)

01:53.075 --> 01:55.375
Hey, dude, I hate to be that guy,

01:55.477 --> 01:58.311
but you think we could maybe
lay down some ground rules?

01:58.412 --> 01:59.613
Nothing formal.

01:59.714 --> 02:01.281
Fire away.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.951
I'm pretty easy, as long as...

02:04.051 --> 02:07.654
maybe no boxers on the furniture,

02:07.675 --> 02:09.976
don't use my hair gel,

02:10.077 --> 02:12.279
and pay your rent on time, and I'm good.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.781
Okay. No problem, roomie.

02:14.882 --> 02:16.255
Sweet. Do you have any rules of your own?

02:17.625 --> 02:19.793
<i>Well, when it comes to the ladies,</i>

02:19.895 --> 02:21.929
I guess I appreciate a
certain amount of privacy,

02:22.030 --> 02:24.198
which I don't so much have out here.

02:24.299 --> 02:25.566
Right.

02:25.667 --> 02:28.669
And we need some kind of code,

02:28.770 --> 02:30.971
you know, like a
sock-on-the-door kind of thing,

02:31.072 --> 02:33.507
in case one of us has
a visitor, if you will.

02:33.608 --> 02:36.810
What about just actually
like a sock on the door?

02:36.911 --> 02:38.545
Is that too telling?

02:38.646 --> 02:40.581
<i>- No, it's simple. I like it.
- (Phone ringing)</i>

02:40.682 --> 02:42.415
Okay.

02:42.516 --> 02:44.885
Hey, this is Toby.

02:44.986 --> 02:47.153
Oh, hey, Coach Rausch. How's it going?

02:47.255 --> 02:48.721
Really? That's weird.

02:48.822 --> 02:50.623
<i>(Knocking on door)</i>

02:53.895 --> 02:56.562
You're not pizza.

02:56.663 --> 02:58.064
What are you doing here?

02:58.165 --> 02:59.399
I live here now.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.133
You what?

03:01.234 --> 03:04.236
Toby needed a roommate, plus
my new roommate was a tool,

03:04.337 --> 03:05.938
equals here I am.

03:06.039 --> 03:07.854
Would have been nice for
somebody to run it by me.

03:07.942 --> 03:08.976
You've got to be kidding.

03:09.077 --> 03:10.911
Nobody thought that this
would be awkward for me?

03:11.012 --> 03:13.480
I de-pledged Omega Psi for you.

03:13.581 --> 03:15.148
And then you cheated on
me and you lied about it.

03:15.249 --> 03:17.669
And then you dumped me anyway.
So I lost all my friends

03:17.670 --> 03:18.920
and I became a pariah at school.

03:18.921 --> 03:21.825
And that is why I'm living
on your brother's couch.

03:22.923 --> 03:24.991
Good point.

03:25.092 --> 03:26.292
Yeah.

03:26.393 --> 03:27.627
Is that for him?

03:27.728 --> 03:30.830
- Uh...
- I'll tell Toby you came by.

- Look at that!
- Congratulations.

05:15.218 --> 05:17.520
I'm so happy for you.

05:18.789 --> 05:20.757
The first of many "yes" s.

05:20.858 --> 05:22.425
Thanks, guys.

05:22.526 --> 05:25.061
Do you have an idea when you'll
hear from the other schools?

05:25.162 --> 05:27.530
Northwestern is still a possibility, right?

05:27.630 --> 05:29.598
It should be any day now.

05:29.699 --> 05:32.334
Regina is going to be
thrilled when she finds out.

05:32.436 --> 05:36.372
I think I left my jacket
in the laundry room.

05:36.473 --> 05:39.341
So...

05:42.779 --> 05:45.380
I think she's still mad at Regina.

05:45.481 --> 05:47.049
She's mad at the world.

05:47.149 --> 05:49.051
Maybe we should talk to her again.

05:49.151 --> 05:51.053
No, we should give it a little more time.

05:51.153 --> 05:52.120
Okay.

05:52.221 --> 05:53.589
I should get to work.

05:53.690 --> 05:54.923
Mmm.

05:55.024 --> 05:56.925
See you later.

05:57.026 --> 05:58.359
Bye.

<i>(Door opens, closes)</i>

06:01.964 --> 06:05.333
(Knocking)

06:05.434 --> 06:08.169
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:08.270 --> 06:09.704
Sorry to just drop in on you.

06:09.805 --> 06:11.139
I can come back another time.

06:11.240 --> 06:15.210
No, um, please come on in.

06:22.951 --> 06:24.652
Um...

06:24.753 --> 06:26.687
<i>they're financiers,</i>

06:26.788 --> 06:28.122
which is a fancy word

06:28.223 --> 06:29.356
for muffin, apparently.

06:29.457 --> 06:32.226
People rave about them. I don't know.

06:32.327 --> 06:34.128
Oh.

06:34.229 --> 06:36.963
I'm sorry for your loss.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.965
Thank you.

06:40.235 --> 06:43.403
So what's going on with the project?

06:43.505 --> 06:45.405
Oh, we don't have to talk about that.

06:45.507 --> 06:50.010
You hate small talk. And I'm
really interested in what I missed.

06:50.111 --> 06:52.512
We're breaking ground tomorrow.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.448
- Really?
- Yeah, finally. Can you believe it?

06:55.549 --> 06:59.519
Would it be okay if I came?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.621
Well, yeah, I would
love for you to be there,

07:01.722 --> 07:03.556
- but if you're not ready...
- I'd like to see it.

07:03.658 --> 07:04.924
We worked really hard to get here.

07:05.026 --> 07:07.160
Okay. I'll have a hard hat ready for you.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.462
Thanks. Have a seat.

07:09.563 --> 07:14.066
You want some coffee or a fancy muffin?

07:14.168 --> 07:16.702
<i>You mean financier.</i>

07:16.803 --> 07:19.639
<i>Excuse me... financier.</i>

07:21.775 --> 07:24.242
Oh, um, Wes,

07:24.343 --> 07:26.845
this is my daughter Daphne.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.847
Daphne, this is Wes.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.515
It's nice to meet you.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.251
Would you like a very fancy muffin?

07:33.352 --> 07:35.120
Yeah, I need to be able to see

07:35.221 --> 07:37.355
your lips to understand you.

07:39.850 --> 07:43.603
_

07:43.616 --> 07:44.729
Never came up.

07:44.830 --> 07:48.766
Daphne is deaf, but she can read lips.

07:50.102 --> 07:51.570
Sorry.

07:51.671 --> 07:54.673
I was just saying...

07:54.773 --> 07:57.208
- Nothing important.
- What are you doing here?

07:57.309 --> 08:00.745
- Daphne.
- I was here telling your mom

08:00.846 --> 08:02.780
that we're just breaking ground
on the East Riverside project

08:02.881 --> 08:04.615
and that your mom's been
a very big part of it.

08:04.717 --> 08:09.286
I was actually thinking
about attending the ceremony.

08:09.387 --> 08:12.556
Oh, I guess all it takes is a
few weeks and a muffin basket.

08:12.657 --> 08:14.157
(Clears throat)

08:14.259 --> 08:15.859
I should probably go.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.261
Do what you want.

08:17.362 --> 08:18.862
I'm going to school.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.000
<i>(Door slams)</i>

08:27.025 --> 08:28.559
What's up, killer?

08:28.660 --> 08:31.094
Don't even try to make
me run laps right now,

08:31.195 --> 08:33.664
unless you want this chocolate
milk spewed everywhere.

08:33.765 --> 08:36.933
I come in peace, bearing gifts.

08:37.034 --> 08:40.437
<i>An angry little huldufólk... Icelandic elf.</i>

08:40.538 --> 08:41.905
It's awesome.

08:42.006 --> 08:44.241
It's my new spirit animal. (Laughs)

08:45.943 --> 08:48.511
So how's your mom?

08:48.612 --> 08:50.246
She's all right.

08:50.347 --> 08:51.915
She's out of the treatment center,

08:52.016 --> 08:54.017
so I'm just trying to
get her into a routine.

08:56.154 --> 08:58.789
- So Coach Rausch called me.
- Uh...

08:58.890 --> 09:02.758
Said that you didn't turn in some forms
for your scholarship a few weeks ago.

09:02.859 --> 09:05.428
I didn't see a point in
turning in all those forms

09:05.529 --> 09:07.597
since it looks like I'm probably
going to be failing English.

09:07.698 --> 09:09.699
Wait, what?

09:09.800 --> 09:10.201
(Sighs)

09:10.802 --> 09:12.535
I got caught up with stuff with my mom

09:12.636 --> 09:13.870
and I bombed this really big test.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.305
And the teacher, she
doesn't give make-ups.

09:15.406 --> 09:17.973
Well, did you explain why you bombed it?

09:18.075 --> 09:20.910
I tried, but Miss Summers, she
doesn't care what the excuse is.

09:21.011 --> 09:23.279
Wait, Miss Summers? The British girl?

09:23.380 --> 09:25.515
- I mean lady?
- Yeah.

09:25.616 --> 09:28.451
Okay. We can fix this.

09:28.552 --> 09:30.153
This isn't your problem.

09:30.154 --> 09:32.422
Hey, I got you into this craziness,

09:32.523 --> 09:34.256
and I'm going to continue
to guide you through it.

09:34.357 --> 09:35.958
- Cool?
- Thanks.

09:36.059 --> 09:37.927
Oh, but good luck, 'cause she's a lot.

09:38.028 --> 09:39.128
Oh, I'm aware.

09:46.236 --> 09:48.505
- Toby.
- Hey.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.342
Thanks for telling me
Tank's your new roommate.

09:52.443 --> 09:55.645
I'm sorry. We were literally
sealing the deal when you showed up.

09:55.746 --> 09:57.347
You know, I knew I had it coming.

09:57.448 --> 09:59.048
I just wasn't expecting it there.

09:59.149 --> 10:00.583
Well, it's not just you.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.552
He's freaking out 'cause
his dad's coming into town.

10:02.653 --> 10:04.687
Why?

10:04.788 --> 10:08.423
He hasn't told him that he
de-pledged Lambda Panda or whatever,

10:08.524 --> 10:10.559
and he's afraid he's not
going to take it very well.

10:10.660 --> 10:12.728
(Sighs) Fun times.

10:12.829 --> 10:15.064
Later.

10:32.768 --> 10:35.204
<i>- Hey.
- (Bells tolling)</i>

10:35.305 --> 10:36.838
Hey.

10:43.512 --> 10:46.180
Look, there is no way for this to be easy.

10:46.281 --> 10:48.650
We have this class and
you're Toby's roommate now.

10:48.751 --> 10:52.120
- I'm not moving out.
- Of course not. I didn't mean that.

10:53.689 --> 10:57.225
I just hate that you hate me.

11:01.563 --> 11:04.793
Look, I forgot to say something yesterday.

11:04.867 --> 11:06.267
I think I got the point.

11:06.368 --> 11:09.838
No. I'm sorry about Angelo.

11:09.939 --> 11:12.006
I'm really sorry.

11:12.107 --> 11:14.475
It's awful.

11:14.576 --> 11:17.145
Thanks.

11:19.248 --> 11:22.951
I'm sorry you have to tell
your dad about de-pledging.

11:23.052 --> 11:24.319
Toby mentioned it.

11:24.420 --> 11:25.820
Yeah.

11:25.921 --> 11:28.756
There is that crap sandwich waiting for me.

11:30.592 --> 11:33.293
I could come with you,

11:33.395 --> 11:34.628
if you want.

11:34.730 --> 11:36.497
Why?

11:36.598 --> 11:38.165
For moral support.

11:38.266 --> 11:40.735
Maybe he won't get too upset
if you have a friend with you.

11:41.937 --> 11:43.671
Trust me, you don't want
to face your dad alone.

11:43.772 --> 11:46.339
It's not a terrible idea.

11:46.441 --> 11:49.276
And my dad loves the ladies.

11:49.377 --> 11:50.544
And I love the dads.

11:50.645 --> 11:53.180
(Laughs) Okay.

11:53.281 --> 11:56.050
(Laughs)

12:02.090 --> 12:03.591
Hey, Nacho.

12:03.692 --> 12:06.894
You come to play spy for your
mom at the community center?

12:06.995 --> 12:09.029
Definitely not.

12:09.130 --> 12:11.164
What happened here?

12:11.265 --> 12:13.667
- Soccer ball.
- Nice of you to fix it.

12:13.768 --> 12:16.603
Maybe it doesn't look it, but we actually
take pride in our appearances here.

12:16.704 --> 12:19.038
Yeah, I know. I used to live here.

12:19.140 --> 12:22.576
Yeah, you'd never guess
it looking at you now.

12:22.676 --> 12:26.879
- Hey, look, I just wanted to apologize.
- Don't bother.

12:26.981 --> 12:29.048
I feel like I'm about to get
played again and I don't like it.

12:29.150 --> 12:30.597
Hey, you're not the only
one who was lied to here.

12:30.602 --> 12:32.502
My mom told me she stopped working
on the project, but she didn't.

12:32.603 --> 12:33.937
Yeah, I noticed.

12:34.039 --> 12:35.639
And apparently nothing
is going to stop her.

12:35.740 --> 12:36.974
I thought you were on her side.

12:37.075 --> 12:38.208
Yeah, I was.

12:38.309 --> 12:40.678
She's...

12:40.779 --> 12:42.646
changed.

12:45.616 --> 12:48.585
There's a groundbreaking ceremony tomorrow.

12:48.686 --> 12:51.188
I'm sorry. I guess it's
really going to happen.

12:53.957 --> 12:56.926
You could always rain on the parade.

12:57.027 --> 13:00.397
Do what you want. I won't say anything.

13:01.932 --> 13:03.233
Uh...

13:03.334 --> 13:05.501
Where are you going?

13:05.602 --> 13:07.070
Home.

13:07.171 --> 13:09.471
- To do what?
- I don't know.

13:09.573 --> 13:10.940
Look, if you're really pissed at your ma,

13:11.041 --> 13:12.508
and you need her to know,
then you've got to show her.

13:12.609 --> 13:14.844
I'm thinking of paying the
work site a visit tonight.

13:14.945 --> 13:17.313
You know, roll out the "unwelcome" mat.

13:17.414 --> 13:19.481
You want to come?

13:19.583 --> 13:22.718
No, I don't really think that's my scene.

13:22.819 --> 13:25.221
Or, you know, you could just go home

13:25.322 --> 13:29.291
and sit in your central
air and just boil up inside.

13:33.597 --> 13:36.865
All right. I'm in.

13:36.966 --> 13:39.801
Cool. I'll see you tonight.

13:49.222 --> 13:51.189
Hey, there.

13:51.291 --> 13:53.525
Wow, you really are everywhere.

13:53.626 --> 13:56.628
I swung by to check on some
of my old field hockey kids.

13:56.729 --> 13:58.696
<i>(Classical music playing)</i>

13:58.798 --> 14:02.267
Tchaikovsky. Um, "Memory of a dear place"?

14:02.368 --> 14:04.769
- How did you know that?
- I like to listen to him

14:04.870 --> 14:07.039
when I want my thoughts to go away.

14:07.140 --> 14:08.473
Me too.

14:10.643 --> 14:13.578
- Did you need something?
- Yeah, I wanted to talk to you.

14:13.679 --> 14:16.548
Sharee Gifford is in your
English lit class, right?

14:16.649 --> 14:17.615
Yup.

14:17.716 --> 14:19.116
She was my star player.

14:19.217 --> 14:21.753
And she thinks she's
going to flunk your class.

14:21.854 --> 14:24.422
Yeah, well, she failed
a really important test.

14:24.523 --> 14:25.856
Can she retake it?

14:25.958 --> 14:28.759
I don't do retests.

14:28.860 --> 14:31.429
Sharee doesn't have many
people looking out for her.

14:31.529 --> 14:33.730
Do you know about her mom?

14:33.832 --> 14:37.201
I'm aware there was a family
situation, but she had weeks to prepare.

14:37.302 --> 14:39.036
Can't you make an exception?

14:39.137 --> 14:42.739
If I make an exception for her, I
have to make an exception for everyone.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.176
Look, I don't come into your D.J.
booth and teach you how to spin.

14:45.187 --> 14:46.253
This is my job.

14:46.354 --> 14:48.689
Her scholarship is on the line here.

14:48.790 --> 14:50.191
That's not my problem.

14:50.292 --> 14:52.460
Why are you being such
a hard-ass about this?

14:52.561 --> 14:54.462
This isn't prison. This is high school.

14:54.563 --> 14:56.029
You're playing with this girl's future.

14:56.131 --> 15:00.100
I have a curriculum meeting with
principal Rose in five minutes.

15:00.201 --> 15:02.002
- Excuse me.
- Hey, come on.

15:02.103 --> 15:06.773
- I didn't mean for this to...
- Whatever this is, it's over.

Poor Travis.

16:07.142 --> 16:11.312
I know how he feels.

16:11.413 --> 16:14.148
You and me and Mary Beth

16:14.249 --> 16:15.148
should take him out for some fun.

16:15.149 --> 16:19.746
_

16:19.856 --> 16:24.073
Uh, I can't. I'm having
dinner with Tank and his dad.

16:24.087 --> 16:25.832
Don't freak out.

16:25.833 --> 16:27.070
_

16:27.074 --> 16:31.494
He's telling his dad that
he de-pledged his fraternity.

16:31.595 --> 16:33.621
It's a big deal.

16:33.622 --> 16:36.835
_

16:36.867 --> 16:41.436
Of course it is. But I did
something awful to Tank.

16:41.537 --> 16:44.706
And the least I can do

16:44.807 --> 16:47.977
is be there when he tells his dad

16:48.078 --> 16:49.279
that he's de-pledging.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.615
_

16:52.582 --> 16:55.150
He doesn't have a lot of friends right now.

16:55.251 --> 16:57.049
Emmett, it is one dinner.

16:57.055 --> 16:58.655
And it's going to be boring and awkward.

16:58.756 --> 17:02.993
And I owe it to him. We both do.

17:02.994 --> 17:05.531
_

17:20.545 --> 17:22.912
You're gonna do great.

17:23.012 --> 17:24.981
He'll understand.

17:25.082 --> 17:28.751
You look... wow.

17:28.853 --> 17:32.155
Thank you.

17:32.256 --> 17:34.190
Um... (Clears throat)

17:34.291 --> 17:36.792
I should have told you this before

17:36.894 --> 17:41.263
but, uh, my dad thinks we're still dating.

17:41.365 --> 17:42.898
- What?
- Yeah.

17:42.999 --> 17:45.267
I was going to tell him, but...

17:47.170 --> 17:50.639
Can you please just go with it? Please?

17:50.741 --> 17:53.642
Well, they will just let anyone
in here nowadays, won't they?

17:53.744 --> 17:55.911
- Hey, dad.
- Hey!

17:56.012 --> 17:58.546
- Hey, dad.
- Oh, how you doin', son?

17:58.647 --> 17:59.915
- Good, I'm good.
- Good, good, good.

18:00.016 --> 18:01.917
Um, dad, this is Bay
Kennish, my girlfriend.

18:01.918 --> 18:03.719

18:03.820 --> 18:05.387
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Conroy.

18:05.488 --> 18:06.989
No no no, please, call me Chuck.

18:07.090 --> 18:09.424
Wow, I mean, you told
me that she was gorgeous,

18:09.525 --> 18:12.128
but I thought you were exaggerating
to make yourself feel better.

18:12.149 --> 18:14.082
But... (Clears throat)

18:14.183 --> 18:15.718
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

18:15.819 --> 18:18.220
Can I get a G&T, easy on the "T?"

18:18.321 --> 18:21.023
- Yes, sir.
- You know what? Make that a double.

18:21.124 --> 18:23.659
- Yeah, let's not waste time, right?
- (Both laughing)

18:23.760 --> 18:25.828
Okay, thank you, darling.

18:25.929 --> 18:27.730

lovebirds coming out to join me.

18:31.234 --> 18:34.770
I know you would rather
spend the evening alone.

18:34.871 --> 18:36.171
I was young once, you know.

18:36.272 --> 18:39.274

18:39.375 --> 18:42.177
Okay, why are you sitting
so far apart from your girl?

18:42.278 --> 18:45.080
Come on, get closer. Show her some love.

the Sharee Gifford situation?

22:38.216 --> 22:39.883
No clue.

22:39.984 --> 22:43.086
That's so strange, because I saw you
coming out of her office after school.

22:43.187 --> 22:46.957
She's a close family friend.

22:47.057 --> 22:50.026
How dare you? You don't like my answer,

22:50.127 --> 22:52.662

your family connections?

22:52.763 --> 22:54.531

do you care about her so much?

I really hope you're not asking
what I think you're asking.

23:03.707 --> 23:06.742
I just know there's no such
thing as a selfless act.

23:06.843 --> 23:09.545
She's a good kid. I'm
trying to help her out!

23:09.546 --> 23:12.781
Okay. Well, if you need to
infuse your life with meaning,

23:12.882 --> 23:14.550
I'd appreciate it if you did it in a way

23:14.651 --> 23:16.285
that didn't interfere with my classroom.

23:16.386 --> 23:18.354
Oh, so my life has no meaning?

23:18.455 --> 23:20.690
I don't know. I barely know you.

23:20.790 --> 23:22.157
That's right, you don't.

23:22.259 --> 23:24.293
And don't presume to know me.

23:25.962 --> 23:28.430
Why are you staring at me?

23:43.510 --> 23:44.743

pledge duties at the house,

24:00.159 --> 24:02.094
you know, if you flunk a class?

24:02.195 --> 24:04.263
Yeah, I think so. (Laughs)

24:04.364 --> 24:05.998
But it doesn't really matter.

24:31.356 --> 24:33.190
What?

24:33.292 --> 24:35.293
I dropped out.

24:35.394 --> 24:37.128
I de-pledged.

24:37.896 --> 24:39.897
They were awful to him.

24:39.998 --> 24:41.733
And they did awful things.

24:41.834 --> 24:44.603
You want to know half the
stupid stuff we did as pledges?

24:44.704 --> 24:45.770
Who cares?

24:45.871 --> 24:47.405
You were this close to becoming a brother.

<i>Those guys were jerks.</i>

24:48.974 --> 24:51.042
They threw a party to humiliate girls.

Oh. So what now, hmm?

24:54.213 --> 24:56.247
What's the plan? Do you even have a plan?

24:56.348 --> 24:58.716
Yeah, I'm not dropping
out of school or anything.

24:58.817 --> 25:01.652
But it felt like a time suck.

25:01.754 --> 25:04.188
And, you know, now I'm freed
up to do all these other things.

25:04.289 --> 25:06.390
Like, last night I went
to this vegetarian dinner

25:06.391 --> 25:07.959
'cause I had nobody else to eat with,

25:08.060 --> 25:09.827
and it turns out I really like it.

25:09.928 --> 25:11.895
Vegetarian food?

25:11.997 --> 25:14.432
- You do?
- And I signed up to take this meditation class.

25:14.532 --> 25:16.133
What the hell is going on?

25:16.234 --> 25:18.069
All right, this is not coming out right.

25:18.070 --> 25:21.272
I'm not turning into a hippie or anything.

25:21.373 --> 25:22.839
You know? I still love football.

25:22.940 --> 25:25.842
It's just that I want to try new stuff too.

25:25.943 --> 25:27.878
I want to expand my world view.

25:27.979 --> 25:30.181
- Isn't that the point of college?
- Give me a break.

25:30.282 --> 25:31.715
Miles, I wasn't born yesterday.

25:31.816 --> 25:33.917
This girl didn't like who you were,

25:34.018 --> 25:36.320
so you changed to make her happy.

25:36.421 --> 25:39.723
Omega Psi has been in our
family for three generations.

25:39.824 --> 25:42.292
You've had this girl for
how long? What, a week?

25:42.393 --> 25:43.927
Her name is Bay.

25:45.563 --> 25:48.331
And she's not my girl.

25:48.432 --> 25:50.033
Not anymore.

25:50.134 --> 25:52.502
I don't understand.
Didn't you tell me that...

25:54.471 --> 25:55.838
We broke up a while ago.

25:55.939 --> 25:58.007
We're better as friends.

25:58.108 --> 25:59.475
Whoa.

25:59.577 --> 26:00.911
Wow.

26:01.012 --> 26:04.280
Okay, so no girl and no fraternity.

26:04.381 --> 26:05.983
That's rich.

26:06.084 --> 26:07.884
You know what, dad?

26:07.986 --> 26:10.453
I made the decision. It's over.

26:10.554 --> 26:12.322
You don't have to like it,
but I'm telling you this

26:12.423 --> 26:14.857
for your information, not
your approval. So get over it.

26:24.135 --> 26:25.368
Dad?

26:28.405 --> 26:30.906
(Door closes)

26:34.460 --> 26:36.627
Daphne: I can't believe I just did that!

26:36.729 --> 26:38.195
I'm on probation!

26:38.296 --> 26:40.431
Wait, how do you mean? Like at school?

26:40.532 --> 26:42.734
No, like with the courts.

26:42.835 --> 26:45.670
Like, I have a probation
officer. I did community service.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.473
(Laughs) Wait, what?

26:48.574 --> 26:49.741
It's a long story.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.209
Lay it on me.

26:52.310 --> 26:53.911
I...

26:54.012 --> 26:57.781
I blackmailed this politician

26:57.883 --> 27:00.117
because he was sleeping with his intern

27:00.218 --> 27:01.986
and being a total hypocrite.

27:02.087 --> 27:03.854
Wait, are you serious?

27:06.391 --> 27:07.958
Man, I like a girl with conviction.

27:08.059 --> 27:10.093
Let's get out of here.

27:10.194 --> 27:12.295
Hey, hold up.

27:23.941 --> 27:25.975
Bad girl, huh?

27:34.101 --> 27:36.770
Mmm, wait, slow down.

27:36.871 --> 27:38.271
What's wrong?

27:38.372 --> 27:41.274
I just, um...

27:41.375 --> 27:43.376
we should go.

27:43.477 --> 27:45.645
It's cool. Let's get out of here.

27:54.450 --> 27:58.032
_

27:58.033 --> 28:02.963
_

28:02.964 --> 28:09.117
_

28:09.118 --> 28:13.617
_

28:16.475 --> 28:18.095
What about some place nearby?

28:18.096 --> 28:20.423
_

28:21.424 --> 28:24.343
_

28:25.680 --> 28:28.508
_

28:28.509 --> 28:31.240
_

28:31.690 --> 28:33.458
When you were at Gallaudet,

28:33.559 --> 28:35.693
you helped take over the school.

28:36.829 --> 28:39.297
- You demanded a deaf president.
- _

28:40.800 --> 28:43.200
If that Melody were here now...

28:44.937 --> 28:47.472
What would she do?

28:50.175 --> 28:53.744
He's not going to cut you
off or anything, is he?

28:53.845 --> 28:56.981
I don't know. I don't think so.

28:57.082 --> 28:59.883
I don't care.

28:59.985 --> 29:04.788
I've pissed my dad off so many times.

29:05.790 --> 29:08.359
They always come around.

29:08.460 --> 29:10.694
I'm sorry to put you
in an awkward position.

29:10.795 --> 29:12.563
It's okay.

29:12.664 --> 29:14.865
No, it was really cool of you to come,

29:14.966 --> 29:17.968
especially after I was
such an ass the other day.

29:18.069 --> 29:20.637
I totally deserved it.

29:20.738 --> 29:25.408
And I'm really sorry
for how everything ended.

29:25.509 --> 29:27.810
Can we go back to being friends?

29:27.911 --> 29:30.613
Yeah, I would love that.

29:33.117 --> 29:34.417
(Sighs)

29:34.418 --> 29:36.153
All right.

29:36.354 --> 29:38.188
Let's get out of here.

29:40.224 --> 29:41.591
You know, I kind of think I know

29:41.692 --> 29:43.359
what gay kids feel like when they come out.

29:45.062 --> 29:47.898
Not just gay kids.

29:47.999 --> 29:51.334
No, not that de-pledging
is the same as coming out.

29:51.435 --> 29:53.536
- I mean...
- I have to tell you something.

29:53.637 --> 29:55.605
Are... are you gay?

29:55.706 --> 29:58.274
No. Um...

29:58.375 --> 30:02.445
But if I tell you, you have to
promise you won't tell anyone.

30:02.546 --> 30:04.213
Yeah, of course.

30:04.315 --> 30:06.215
What is it?

30:06.317 --> 30:08.050
Not here.

30:09.853 --> 30:11.624
Well, then...

30:13.290 --> 30:16.259
My first Brit.

30:16.360 --> 30:19.763
Did you just victory pump our liaison?

30:19.864 --> 30:22.232
(Both laughing)

30:24.368 --> 30:26.302
Am I your first American?

30:26.403 --> 30:28.071
Toby, I am American.

30:28.172 --> 30:29.805
(British accent) Oh, really?

30:29.906 --> 30:32.308
I was born here.

30:32.409 --> 30:35.145
My parents sent me to
boarding school when I was 10.

30:35.246 --> 30:37.813
By dad's a Brit, so attending Eastbourne

30:37.914 --> 30:40.750
is kind of a family
tradition. Hence the accent.

30:40.851 --> 30:42.051
(British accent) Got it.

30:42.153 --> 30:45.888
<i>You are my first divorcé, though.</i>

30:45.989 --> 30:48.891
Right.

30:53.496 --> 30:55.798
Hey, about Sharee, I just...

30:55.899 --> 30:59.635
I feel like if you gave her another
shot, she would nail that test.

30:59.736 --> 31:02.771
Why are we talking about this again?

31:02.872 --> 31:05.641
Because I thought it was unresolved.

31:05.741 --> 31:07.876
Nope.

31:07.878 --> 31:10.612
It was quite resolved.

31:10.713 --> 31:13.715
- But I...
- You just thought if we did this,

31:13.816 --> 31:16.051
that I'd change my rules.

31:16.152 --> 31:18.087
No, I just still think that
you're being a little hard on her.

31:18.188 --> 31:19.988
Unbelievable.

31:20.089 --> 31:22.056
Just unbelievable.

31:22.157 --> 31:24.325
Lily, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean for this to happen.

31:24.427 --> 31:26.995
No, um, neither did I.

31:27.096 --> 31:29.964
So let's pretend it never did.

31:38.260 --> 31:41.062
An aneurysm? Yikes.

31:41.163 --> 31:43.363
Genetically speaking,

31:43.464 --> 31:46.701
with my dad and my aunt having one,

31:46.802 --> 31:49.704
the odds aren't in my favor.

31:49.805 --> 31:53.273
Can anything be done if you have one?

31:53.374 --> 31:56.177
- I don't know.
- Can you manage it,

31:56.277 --> 31:58.345
- or, like, try to prevent it?
- I don't know.

31:58.446 --> 32:01.014
Are they only in your brain or
can you get them somewhere else,

32:01.115 --> 32:02.749
- like a blood clot?
- I don't know!

32:02.850 --> 32:05.319
- I haven't seen a doctor.
- Well, why not?

32:07.121 --> 32:09.789
Because if I go see him,

32:09.890 --> 32:11.925
then it's real.

32:12.026 --> 32:15.829
Bay, go see a doctor.

32:17.464 --> 32:19.065
I could come with you.

32:19.166 --> 32:22.268
No, I...

32:22.369 --> 32:23.937
thank you for the offer, but...

32:24.038 --> 32:25.605
You have a boyfriend.

32:27.175 --> 32:29.843
Look, it's better to know.

32:29.944 --> 32:32.245
Okay? And I'm sure you're going to be fine.

32:32.347 --> 32:33.780
But just go see a doctor.

32:33.881 --> 32:35.482
Yeah.

32:35.583 --> 32:37.517
Okay.

32:38.820 --> 32:40.119
Thanks.

32:52.333 --> 32:55.534
Yeah, come on. You got to give me a bid.

32:55.635 --> 32:58.271
You gotta do better than that.

32:58.372 --> 33:01.507
- Please.
- (Phone beeps off)

33:01.608 --> 33:04.610
You said we were vandalized, but this?

33:04.711 --> 33:05.778
Yeah, this is a catastrophe.

33:05.789 --> 33:08.524
They put sand in the oil fillers
of our top-of-the-line tractors.

33:08.525 --> 33:10.059
Can't you just clean it out?

33:10.161 --> 33:12.395
No, you can't. The engines are scrapped.

33:12.496 --> 33:14.530
You know how much money we're talking here?

33:14.631 --> 33:16.065
That's what insurance is for.

33:16.167 --> 33:18.067
Well, try explaining
that to our contractor.

33:18.169 --> 33:19.669
- They dropped the project.
- What?!

33:19.770 --> 33:22.237
They're afraid that this
is only the beginning

33:22.339 --> 33:24.440
and that their payday isn't worth the risk.

33:24.441 --> 33:26.876
- So we'll get a new contractor.
- I've already called five companies.

33:26.977 --> 33:30.380
They're all hedging or slapping
us with some outrageous bid.

33:30.481 --> 33:31.614
So we'll keep trying.

33:31.715 --> 33:33.816
That could take weeks. We
need to break ground now

33:33.917 --> 33:36.118
or we'll lose our permits
and put the job in jeopardy.

33:37.921 --> 33:39.955
(Sighs) Look...

33:40.056 --> 33:43.225
There is a contractor
willing to take the project

33:43.326 --> 33:44.960
for a fair price.

33:45.061 --> 33:47.095
Frontier.

33:47.196 --> 33:49.464
Chip Coto's company? Absolutely not.

33:49.566 --> 33:51.633
- We don't have a choice.
- You agreed with me.

33:51.734 --> 33:54.770
The guy is a complete slimeball.
No way we are going to bankroll him.

33:54.771 --> 33:56.238
Do we want this project to happen?

33:56.339 --> 33:57.806
- Yes! But...
- Then like it or not,

33:57.907 --> 33:59.708
chip Coto is the only option we have left.

33:59.809 --> 34:01.677
So once again, the bad guy wins.

34:01.778 --> 34:04.479
(Phone ringing)

34:04.580 --> 34:07.315
You better have something good for me.

36:11.742 --> 36:14.342

36:18.977 --> 36:21.212
Hey, Lily?

36:21.313 --> 36:24.315
Oh, pretend you're deaf.
That's... that's cute.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.117
Jeez, you're fast...

36:27.218 --> 36:28.886
at walking.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.287
What do you want?

36:30.388 --> 36:32.255
I got you something.

36:34.626 --> 36:38.462
They're ear plugs. Since
you're a light sleeper and all,

36:38.563 --> 36:41.465
and your jerk of a
downstairs neighbor is loud.

36:42.176 --> 36:44.645
I want you to know what happened between us

36:44.746 --> 36:47.247
had nothing to do with
Sharee. I didn't plan that.

36:47.348 --> 36:50.450
I didn't seduce you in order to
get you to re-administer a test

36:50.552 --> 36:53.420
to a former player of mine.
That would be slightly insane.

36:53.522 --> 36:56.223
Slightly.

36:56.324 --> 36:58.858
For the record,

36:58.959 --> 37:01.828
I am capable of empathy.

37:01.929 --> 37:04.364
But my little brother...

37:04.465 --> 37:07.034
he's deaf and has loads
of other medical issues.

37:07.135 --> 37:09.736
And I grew up watching my parents

37:09.837 --> 37:11.571
and all of his teachers baby him.

37:11.672 --> 37:13.507
And it didn't do him any favors.

37:13.607 --> 37:16.075
It wasn't until people
stopped making excuses for him

37:16.176 --> 37:18.411
and forced him to truly try

37:18.512 --> 37:20.346
that he made any real progress.

37:20.447 --> 37:22.214
I didn't know that.

37:22.315 --> 37:23.950
Well, now you do.

37:24.051 --> 37:26.218
Anyway, I've got to run.

37:26.319 --> 37:28.673
Actually, I've got a student
taking a make-up test right now.

37:29.757 --> 37:30.990
Sharee?

37:33.727 --> 37:35.695
You do that a lot, don't you?

37:35.796 --> 37:37.830
Just when I'm happy.

38:04.931 --> 38:06.205
