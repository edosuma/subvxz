WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:04.400
Bobby:
it looks
like a... Rabbit.

00:04.467 --> 00:07.000
Peggy:
oh, I guess that's
the tail, huh?

00:07.067 --> 00:08.200
Very good, honey.

00:08.267 --> 00:09.633
What else do you see?

00:09.700 --> 00:11.333
That one looks
like a pig.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.233
No, wait--
maybe it's a ham.

00:13.300 --> 00:14.933
Bobby, in your
imagination

00:15.000 --> 00:16.733
there are no
wrong answers.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.933
Look, mom, a bee.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.133
Well, yeah, I guess
that could be

00:20.200 --> 00:22.267
maybe a puffy
little wing and...

00:22.333 --> 00:25.000
oh.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.733
We even fooled a bee.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.600
Well, that's because
bees are stupid.

00:28.667 --> 00:31.000
Fool an owl... Then we'll talk.

01:02.367 --> 01:06.600
Hank:
guess who sold
three barbecues today.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.133
Dad! In here!

01:08.200 --> 01:09.667
I'm painting my room.

01:09.733 --> 01:11.633
Well, all right, son.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.733
You can finally wear
those overalls

01:13.800 --> 01:15.333
without being embarrassed.

01:15.400 --> 01:18.333
I'll get the funsaver.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.700
Uh, eh, hold on a minute.

01:19.767 --> 01:21.533
This is our son's
first paint job.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.267
Do we really want
to remember it

01:23.333 --> 01:24.500
looking all blotchy?

01:24.567 --> 01:25.733
Those aren't blotches.

01:25.800 --> 01:26.833
They're clouds.

01:26.900 --> 01:28.300
huh?

01:32.133 --> 01:34.067
You painted clouds?

01:34.100 --> 01:36.500
White, puffy clouds.

01:36.567 --> 01:38.733
This is a boy's room,
not a day-care center.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.267
A boy's room
should be blue.

01:40.333 --> 01:41.367
I'm painting it back.

01:41.433 --> 01:42.833
Hank--

01:42.900 --> 01:44.200
Please do not
stifle him.

01:44.267 --> 01:46.600
If my son wants
to stare at clouds, then...

01:46.667 --> 01:48.333
He can look out
the dang window.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.233
He can see all the
clouds he wants.

01:50.300 --> 01:51.733
Not at night.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.600
Mm-hmm. At night, all you
can see out that window

01:54.667 --> 01:56.567
is bill dancing with his mop.

01:59.767 --> 02:02.267
yup.

02:02.333 --> 02:03.267
yup.

02:03.333 --> 02:04.333
yup.

02:05.333 --> 02:06.333
yup.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.367
You don't
even know

02:07.433 --> 02:08.933
what we were
talking about.

02:09.067 --> 02:10.366
All right,
what is it?

02:10.433 --> 02:12.367
Nancy's birthday's
on saturday

02:12.433 --> 02:14.933
and I'm throwing her
a surprise party.

02:15.067 --> 02:17.533
"abracapasta.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.933
Magic, dining and more."

02:19.067 --> 02:20.133
( groans )

02:20.200 --> 02:22.400
yeah. I been spraying
their kitchen

02:22.467 --> 02:24.067
for roaches and silverfish

02:24.100 --> 02:26.067
and, well,
until business picks up

02:26.100 --> 02:28.367
they're paying me
in free magic shows.

02:30.267 --> 02:31.367
You have
to come.

02:31.433 --> 02:32.933
You already
said "yup."

02:33.067 --> 02:35.267
Oh, all right,
i'll go to the show

02:35.333 --> 02:36.700
but I'm not clapping.

02:36.767 --> 02:38.267
I don't like magicians.

02:38.333 --> 02:39.533
Don't trust 'em.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.067
Ever since
david copperfield

02:41.067 --> 02:42.967
made the statue
of liberty disappear.

02:43.067 --> 02:44.433
Shame oh him.

02:44.500 --> 02:47.400
Remember, people, this
is a covert operation.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.567
I have recruited
one john redcorn

02:49.633 --> 02:51.400
to keep nancy
busy all day.

02:52.767 --> 02:55.900
She will not suspect a thing.

02:57.833 --> 03:00.133
Oh, sug, this
place is perfect.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.933
No one will ever
spot us in this dump.

03:03.067 --> 03:05.400
Uh, maybe you
should take
your hands

03:05.467 --> 03:06.833
out of my jeans now.

03:06.900 --> 03:07.800
Sug, what

03:07.867 --> 03:08.933
is the matter?

03:09.067 --> 03:09.967
You're so...

03:10.067 --> 03:11.267
Oh, my god--
it's dale.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.267
Surprise!

03:13.333 --> 03:15.933
( cheering )

03:16.067 --> 03:17.733
happy birthday, baby.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.400
Happy
birthday,
baby.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.400
Nice work,
john redcorn.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.600
She didn't suspect a thing.

03:23.667 --> 03:25.267
You are so clueless.

03:25.333 --> 03:28.167
Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha.

03:28.233 --> 03:29.467
Honey, you never
get older.

03:29.533 --> 03:30.733
Were you
surprised?

03:30.800 --> 03:33.600
Well, it's been
a wonderful party.

03:33.667 --> 03:34.767
hank

03:34.833 --> 03:37.333
Sit down and enjoy
the magic show.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.400
( sighs )

03:38.467 --> 03:39.800
the last thing I need

03:39.867 --> 03:41.867
is some silky man
in his silky scarves

03:41.933 --> 03:44.100
trying to trick me
into having fun.

03:44.167 --> 03:46.067
Announcer:
ladies and
gentlemen.

03:46.100 --> 03:49.067
Abracapasta is proud to present

03:49.133 --> 03:52.067
all the way
from guadalajara, mexico

03:52.133 --> 03:53.533
the astounding...

03:53.600 --> 03:56.067
Herrera!

04:02.600 --> 04:04.200
Oh, lord.

04:08.667 --> 04:12.700
( audience cheering )

04:12.767 --> 04:17.333
( heavy accent ):
good evening,
ladies and gentlemens.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.800
I am... Astounding herrera.

04:19.867 --> 04:22.367
Get ready to be... Astounded.

04:29.767 --> 04:31.133
Did you see that?

04:31.200 --> 04:33.267
He pulled the watch
right out of his pocket.

04:33.333 --> 04:34.900
Oh, hank, will
you be quiet?

04:34.967 --> 04:36.600
That's not part
of the trick.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.933
Where did that
watch come from?

04:40.467 --> 04:42.733
Yes. There are no wires.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.867
The only thing
holding her up... Is magic.

04:46.933 --> 04:48.267
Sure. Who needs wires

04:48.333 --> 04:50.933
when you got a forklift
behind the curtain?

04:51.067 --> 04:52.600
Hank, would
you please?

04:52.667 --> 04:53.733
( audience gasping )

04:53.800 --> 04:54.933
and now

04:55.067 --> 04:57.667
the sawing of woman in halfs.

05:10.067 --> 05:12.433
You see that now?
he just lied to us.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.933
He didn't
really cut her.

05:14.067 --> 05:16.667
No one wants
to hear it, hank.

05:18.167 --> 05:19.533
For my next illusion

05:19.600 --> 05:22.433
I will need a volunteer
from the audience.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.800
A beautiful womans.

05:23.867 --> 05:24.933
Well...

05:25.067 --> 05:26.433
He's not going
to pick you.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.333
He's got a plant
in the audience.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.267
Hank, you are not sitting
in a room full of idiots.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.600
We know he didn't really
saw that woman.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.133
We know birds don't grow
out of his fingers.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.800
We know his accent
is phony

05:37.867 --> 05:39.267
but we don't care.

05:39.333 --> 05:42.233
The fun is pretending
that it's real.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.467
Ah, yes. You.

05:44.533 --> 05:46.567
Huh? Oh.

05:46.633 --> 05:47.933
( giggles )

05:48.067 --> 05:49.133
excuse me.

05:51.067 --> 05:52.333
Thank you.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.600
And what is your name,
my lovely?

05:54.667 --> 05:58.567
Me lammo peggy hill.

05:58.633 --> 06:01.933
Ah! You speak spanish...

06:02.067 --> 06:03.300
In a way.

06:03.367 --> 06:05.067
Then you must know
that most pinatas

06:05.067 --> 06:06.267
is filled
with the candies.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.300
And este burro
is no exception

06:08.367 --> 06:10.933
but the sweetness
I am filling it with

06:11.067 --> 06:13.633
is the sweetness
that is... Peggy hill.

06:13.700 --> 06:14.733
( chuckles )

06:17.200 --> 06:19.533
man:
get in there, peggy.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.467
Woman:
come on, peggy.

06:29.067 --> 06:31.233
( audience gasps )

06:31.300 --> 06:34.633
I will take three swings
at the burro.

06:34.700 --> 06:37.367
If Miss peggy hill is lucky,
I will miss.

06:37.433 --> 06:39.267
Will she get lucky tonight?

06:39.333 --> 06:41.367
( wicked laugh )

06:41.433 --> 06:42.333
one!

06:42.400 --> 06:43.667
( audience gasps )

06:43.733 --> 06:44.500
two.

06:44.567 --> 06:45.500
( audience gasps )

06:45.567 --> 06:46.933
ay, dios mio.

06:47.067 --> 06:49.267
Will astounding herrera
strike out

06:49.333 --> 06:50.733
with Miss peggy hill?

06:50.800 --> 06:51.933
We shall see.

06:52.067 --> 06:53.067
Three.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.600
All right,
that's enough.

06:54.667 --> 06:56.133
Get out
of the donkey, peggy.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.667
We're going home.

06:57.733 --> 07:00.567
But I still have one more chance
to hit on your wife.

07:00.633 --> 07:01.800
( audience laughs )

07:01.867 --> 07:04.067
all right, mister,
I've had enough

07:04.100 --> 07:05.433
of your tomfoolery.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.967
Let her out of there.

07:07.067 --> 07:08.567
As you wish.

07:12.367 --> 07:14.133
( gasps, cheers )

07:14.200 --> 07:16.600
whee!

07:16.667 --> 07:17.800
Where's peggy?

07:17.867 --> 07:19.400
You bring my wife
back right now

07:19.467 --> 07:20.800
or I'm getting
the manager.

07:20.867 --> 07:21.800
( trilling )

07:21.867 --> 07:22.900
i'm right
here, hank.

07:22.967 --> 07:24.533
( audience gasping )

07:24.600 --> 07:26.867
( cheering )

07:26.933 --> 07:28.267
what?

07:28.333 --> 07:30.200
How did you do that?

07:30.267 --> 07:33.067
I cannot break
the magician's code

07:33.067 --> 07:35.867
and neither
can my lovely assistant.

07:36.933 --> 07:38.867
Okay, that's it.

07:38.933 --> 07:41.333
Nancy's birthday party
is over.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.200
He will not
get very far

07:43.267 --> 07:45.933
without his keys,
ladies and gentlemens.

07:46.067 --> 07:47.867
( applause )

07:47.933 --> 07:50.100
you thief, I'll kick your ass.

07:52.700 --> 07:53.900
( coughing )

07:53.967 --> 07:55.633
what the...?
hey.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.667
( lively music plays )

08:09.600 --> 08:10.867
a trap door.

08:10.933 --> 08:12.100
no.

08:12.167 --> 08:13.533
Mirrors in the...

08:13.600 --> 08:14.767
no.

08:14.833 --> 08:16.067
Rotating stage?

08:16.067 --> 08:17.467
Will you stop it?

08:17.533 --> 08:19.500
I promised herrera
I would not tell

08:19.567 --> 08:22.400
and there is nothing
more important to a magician

08:22.467 --> 08:23.733
than keeping secrets--

08:23.800 --> 08:26.133
Probably because so
many of them are gay.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.633
Well, you made a promise
to me, too--

08:28.700 --> 08:30.100
Love, honor and obey--

08:30.167 --> 08:33.067
And I want you to obey me
when I tell you

08:33.067 --> 08:35.467
to tell me
how that trick was done.

08:35.533 --> 08:36.866
( chuckling )

08:36.933 --> 08:38.200
you just can't stand

08:38.267 --> 08:40.299
that I know something
that you don't.

08:40.366 --> 08:41.799
Well, get used
to it, hank

08:41.866 --> 08:43.067
because I will never

08:43.067 --> 08:44.867
tell you how that
trick was done.

08:44.933 --> 08:46.567
Never, ever.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.300
So, uh...
this herrera

08:51.367 --> 08:52.867
is he, uh...?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.500
Yes, of course he is.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.433
Now leave me alone.

08:56.500 --> 09:00.233
Then the pinata exploded
in a shower of candy.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.233
Wow. What kind
of candy?

09:02.300 --> 09:03.400
Jolly ranchers.

09:03.467 --> 09:04.500
Oh, my god.

09:04.567 --> 09:07.067
But... Poof! I was gone.

09:07.133 --> 09:08.267
Where were you?

09:08.333 --> 09:09.533
Back in my seat

09:09.600 --> 09:12.367
taking a long, cool
sip of my corona.

09:12.433 --> 09:14.567
No one knew how
I got there.

09:14.633 --> 09:17.733
Perhaps not even me.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.067
Would you stop
filling his head with nonsense?

09:21.067 --> 09:24.367
Bobby, there is a perfectly
logical explanation

09:24.433 --> 09:27.067
for your mother's
brief disappearance.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.733
I'm listening.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.233
Well, uh...

09:30.300 --> 09:31.567
You see... Uh...

09:31.633 --> 09:33.733
( peggy sighs )

09:33.800 --> 09:35.900
all right,
I will tell you.

09:35.967 --> 09:37.067
It was magic.

09:37.133 --> 09:38.200
I knew it.

09:38.267 --> 09:39.500
Aren't you late
for school?

09:39.567 --> 09:40.567
It's sunday.

09:40.633 --> 09:42.733
What about sunday school?

09:42.800 --> 09:43.500
oop.

09:44.533 --> 09:45.700
"'and I will dwell

09:45.767 --> 09:48.200
in the house
of the lord forever'

09:48.267 --> 09:49.367
growled the bear."

09:49.433 --> 09:50.800
( church bells ringing )

09:50.867 --> 09:52.600
oh... Before we go--
children, children--

09:52.667 --> 09:54.267
I want to know

09:54.333 --> 09:56.233
who everyone's doing
their bible report on next week.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.533
Bobby hill?

09:57.600 --> 10:00.033
I'm going to do my report
on jesus.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.567
Oh, I love jesus.

10:01.633 --> 10:06.033
Jesus is good,
bobby. Very good.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.567
She disappeared
from the pinata

10:08.633 --> 10:10.900
and reappeared
in her chair.

10:10.967 --> 10:12.700
The question is how.

10:12.767 --> 10:14.033
Any theories?

10:14.100 --> 10:16.700
You're asking me
if I have theories?

10:16.767 --> 10:18.700
About the magic
trick, dale.

10:18.767 --> 10:19.900
Oh. Not a clue.

10:19.967 --> 10:23.900
Ah! It's done with twins.

10:23.967 --> 10:26.900
One peggy in the pinata,
one peggy in the audience.

10:26.967 --> 10:28.933
Another woman who
looks like peggy?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.900
Smells like peggy?
feels like...?

10:30.967 --> 10:33.900
My wife does not
have a twin.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.733
You don't know that
for sure and you never will.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.200
They destroyed
the proof

10:38.267 --> 10:40.367
when they blew up
one of the peggys.

10:40.433 --> 10:42.000
( sighs ):
boomhauer?

10:42.067 --> 10:43.233
I didn't see nothing.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.700
Talking about
that cocktail waitress

10:44.767 --> 10:45.867
gave me her phone number

10:45.933 --> 10:47.233
and go back in that place

10:47.300 --> 10:49.033
and ol' ropes and pulleys
all over, man.

10:49.100 --> 10:50.367
Yeah, that could work.

10:50.433 --> 10:51.867
Peggy is hoisted
by a rope

10:51.933 --> 10:53.400
climbs out a heating duct

10:53.467 --> 10:55.267
runs through the parking lot...

10:55.333 --> 10:56.567
Not even close.

10:56.633 --> 10:59.600
Mom already told you
how the trick was done.

10:59.667 --> 11:00.900
Magic.

11:00.967 --> 11:02.300
I knew it!

11:02.367 --> 11:04.900
Bobby, don't you have
some homework to do?

11:04.967 --> 11:06.067
no.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.300
What about
sunday school homework?

11:08.367 --> 11:10.300
oy.

11:11.833 --> 11:15.767
"this beginning of miracles
did jesus in cana of galilee

11:15.833 --> 11:18.400
"and manifested
forth his glory

11:18.467 --> 11:21.333
and his disciples
believed on him."

11:21.400 --> 11:22.600
What do you think?

11:22.667 --> 11:27.067
Well, it seems
a little, um... Boring.

11:27.133 --> 11:29.267
Yeah. Boring.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.833
But I copied it
right out of the bible.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.900
Oh. Well, I didn't
mean boring. Not boring.

11:33.967 --> 11:35.067
I mean, it's...

11:35.133 --> 11:36.733
No, you're right.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.333
It stinks.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.900
Because you're not
being creative with it.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.233
Okay...

11:42.300 --> 11:44.900
When I substitute teach
a history class

11:44.967 --> 11:48.333
I just don't read the declaration of
independence.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.400
I maybe read it
in a funny voice.

11:50.467 --> 11:52.233
You know, um...

11:52.300 --> 11:55.133
( imitating fat albert):
"hey, hey, hey,
we, the people..."

11:55.200 --> 11:56.567
You see what I'm saying?

11:56.633 --> 11:58.233
Hank:
let's go, luanne.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.067
We're late.

11:59.067 --> 12:00.167
Where are you going?

12:00.233 --> 12:01.200
out.

12:01.267 --> 12:01.867
out?

12:01.933 --> 12:03.333
Yes. Out.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.333
To see the astounding
herrera at abracapasta.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.300
Luanne!

12:07.367 --> 12:08.533
Can I come, too?

12:08.600 --> 12:09.867
Bobby, honey, no.

12:09.933 --> 12:12.300
Your father is just
going to tell you

12:12.367 --> 12:14.067
how all the tricks are done

12:14.133 --> 12:16.700
and possibly ruin magic
for you forever.

12:16.767 --> 12:19.400
Now, wouldn't you rather
stay in your room

12:19.467 --> 12:21.167
and do some homework? Huh?

12:23.133 --> 12:23.967
Ready?

12:24.067 --> 12:25.200
I'll get my coat.

12:26.933 --> 12:30.700
She's got her legs
pulled up to her chest.

12:30.767 --> 12:34.633
So those are fake feet
sticking out of the box.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.833
If it's that
obvious to you

12:36.900 --> 12:38.467
imagine how I feel.

12:38.533 --> 12:39.867
For my final illusion

12:39.933 --> 12:42.700
I will need a volunteer
from the audience--

12:42.767 --> 12:44.067
A beautiful womans.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.200
Okay, luanne--
like we practiced.

12:46.267 --> 12:47.700
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

12:47.767 --> 12:49.733
Yes, please.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.800
In the back.

12:51.867 --> 12:53.833
Yes, please.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.833
In the back.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.167
Yes, please.

12:57.233 --> 12:58.500
( giggling )

12:59.633 --> 13:01.200
I won't really disappear.

13:01.267 --> 13:02.733
I won't
really disappear.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.233
I won't really disappear.

13:04.300 --> 13:07.100
And now,
I step inside the pinata.

13:07.167 --> 13:10.533
Hank:
no! She's supposed
to go in there!

13:10.600 --> 13:12.700
That's not how
you do the trick.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.300
( applause )

13:27.067 --> 13:30.300
psst. Have you figured
it out yet?

13:31.633 --> 13:34.467
Um... I think
that's my seat.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.600
Peggy! Peggy, come here quick!

13:46.667 --> 13:47.933
I figured it out.

13:48.067 --> 13:50.933
All right,
how is it done?

13:51.067 --> 13:52.367
Get in the box. You'll see.

13:52.433 --> 13:54.267
Why can't you just tell me?

13:54.333 --> 13:55.700
Please.

13:55.767 --> 13:57.767
( imitates accent ):
for my next trick

13:57.833 --> 13:59.600
I need a beautiful womans.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.500
Well, all right.

14:10.233 --> 14:11.633
I have sealed

14:11.700 --> 14:13.067
the box.

14:13.067 --> 14:14.333
Okay, now what?

14:14.400 --> 14:16.667
Now you tell me
how that trick was done.

14:16.733 --> 14:18.067
What?

14:18.133 --> 14:20.500
You're not getting out
till you tell me.

14:20.567 --> 14:21.967
Hank hill!
I can wait.

14:22.067 --> 14:25.967
Mom, dad, we're going
to be late for church.

14:26.067 --> 14:28.500
I'll be right there, honey.

14:28.567 --> 14:29.967
Okay.

14:30.067 --> 14:31.867
( sighs )

14:31.933 --> 14:33.467
all right.

14:37.933 --> 14:40.933
"...but I only saw
one set of footprints

14:41.067 --> 14:44.167
'cause god was holding me."

14:44.233 --> 14:45.467
( applause )

14:45.533 --> 14:46.833
peggy...

14:46.900 --> 14:48.533
I'm sorry. I didn't...

14:48.600 --> 14:50.867
Thou shalt
not speak to me.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.300
Our next report
is from bobby hill:

14:53.367 --> 14:55.833
"the amazing jesus."

14:55.900 --> 14:58.867
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

14:58.933 --> 15:01.067
I am the amazing jesus

15:01.133 --> 15:04.833
son of god
and master of prestidigitation!

15:10.500 --> 15:12.067
Thank you!

15:12.133 --> 15:14.567
Has this ever happened to you?

15:14.633 --> 15:17.400
Your followers
want a glass of wine

15:17.467 --> 15:19.567
but all you have is water?

15:19.633 --> 15:23.400
Well, if you're
the amazing jesus, no problem.

15:23.467 --> 15:24.733
Water into wine!

15:24.800 --> 15:26.067
It's a miracle!

15:26.133 --> 15:27.133
John 2:11.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.100
Thank you.

15:28.167 --> 15:30.067
( audience whispering )

15:30.133 --> 15:31.933
now, we're going
to need something

15:32.067 --> 15:33.400
to go with all this wine.

15:33.467 --> 15:35.567
Maybe some bread.

15:35.633 --> 15:38.400
But how are you going
to feed all these hungry people

15:38.467 --> 15:40.400
with just one slice?

15:40.467 --> 15:44.400
No problem
if you're the amazing jesus!

15:44.467 --> 15:45.900
Amen!

15:45.967 --> 15:47.933
It's a miracle,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:48.067 --> 15:49.267
Mark 6:44.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.433
Thank you!

15:50.500 --> 15:51.233
( gasping )

15:51.300 --> 15:52.733
( clapping )

15:52.800 --> 15:54.933
and now, for
my next miracle

15:55.067 --> 15:57.133
i'm going to need
a large wooden cross

15:57.200 --> 15:58.733
and a couple of volunteers.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.633
no!
no!

16:06.333 --> 16:07.933
What you did
was wrong.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.067
You're supposed
to love jesus

16:10.133 --> 16:11.967
not make
a mockery of him.

16:12.067 --> 16:14.433
Next bumper sticker I see,
you will get up here

16:14.500 --> 16:16.267
and you will honk
like the dickens.

16:16.333 --> 16:19.433
I was just trying
to make jesus interesting

16:19.500 --> 16:20.933
like mom told me.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.667
Our lord and savior
does not need any help

16:23.733 --> 16:25.433
keeping people's interest.

16:25.500 --> 16:30.067
I-i... I thought bobby would
make a lamb out of cotton balls.

16:30.067 --> 16:32.400
Now they're going to stick us
in that dang newsletter.

16:32.467 --> 16:34.067
I don't want to be
in the thoughts

16:34.133 --> 16:35.333
and prayers
of anyone

16:35.400 --> 16:37.067
just because
i'm bobby's dad.

16:37.133 --> 16:39.900
Well, you're the one who
dragged him down to abracapasta

16:39.967 --> 16:42.133
and told him how
all the tricks were done.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.233
You just have to take
all the mystery

16:44.300 --> 16:45.533
out of life,
don't you, hank?

16:45.600 --> 16:46.867
Don't blame me.

16:46.933 --> 16:48.233
You're the one
who got him

16:48.300 --> 16:49.567
all worked up
about magic.

16:49.633 --> 16:50.900
You filled his head

16:50.967 --> 16:52.900
with puffy clouds
and jolly ranchers.

16:52.967 --> 16:55.067
What did you think
was going to happen?

16:55.133 --> 16:57.600
My folks yelled at me
the whole way home.

16:57.667 --> 16:58.967
Then they stopped

16:59.067 --> 17:00.333
yelling at me

17:00.400 --> 17:03.133
and started yelling
at each other.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.133
They're still yelling
at each other.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.633
It's all my fault.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.567
Sometimes
my parents fight

17:09.633 --> 17:12.933
but they have a rule--
never go to sleep angry.

17:13.067 --> 17:16.567
They always make up
before going to their bedrooms.

17:16.633 --> 17:17.900
How do they make up?

17:17.967 --> 17:20.367
They do something
nice for each other

17:20.433 --> 17:23.367
like my mom buys my dad
a carton of cigarettes

17:23.433 --> 17:25.633
and my dad buys my mom
a duffel bag

17:25.700 --> 17:27.733
with his
frequent-smoker points.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.700
Yeah! I'll get my parents

17:29.767 --> 17:32.467
to do something nice
for each other.

17:32.533 --> 17:34.933
That's even better than my plan

17:35.067 --> 17:37.733
of turning them both
against luanne.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.700
Mom! Mom, come in here quick!

17:45.767 --> 17:48.467
I've got soup
in the microwave. What?

17:48.533 --> 17:51.367
Dad must have done it.

17:51.433 --> 17:53.467
Isn't that
nice of him?

17:53.533 --> 17:55.533
Maybe it's
just his way

17:55.600 --> 17:57.600
of saying
he's sorry.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.633
Oh, hank.

18:03.067 --> 18:08.133
Oh, you sweet, sweet,
stubborn, sweet, sweet man.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.667
Apology accepted.

18:09.733 --> 18:11.067
What apology?

18:11.067 --> 18:12.333
I didn't do
anything wrong.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.600
Since dad did

18:13.667 --> 18:15.100
something nice for you

18:15.167 --> 18:17.900
maybe you should tell him
how the trick was done.

18:17.967 --> 18:21.067
Oh, now I get it.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.433
You thought you'd just

18:22.500 --> 18:24.433
slap a few clouds
on bobby's wall

18:24.500 --> 18:26.733
and I would give up
herrera's secret?

18:26.800 --> 18:28.200
Clouds?

18:30.667 --> 18:32.067
Oh, lord, they're back!

18:32.067 --> 18:34.067
Right. Nice try,
but it won't work.

18:34.067 --> 18:35.567
I didn't paint
these clouds!

18:35.633 --> 18:36.900
Don't lie,
to me, hank.

18:36.967 --> 18:38.800
I'm not! And
don't you tell me

18:38.867 --> 18:40.467
what to do,either!

18:40.533 --> 18:43.567
Well, I wouldn't dream of it, you
pig-headed liar!

18:43.633 --> 18:47.400
Joseph, I screwed everything up!

18:47.467 --> 18:48.900
Hey, look

18:48.967 --> 18:50.667
what I can do.

18:50.733 --> 18:54.067
( hank yelling indistinctly )

18:54.133 --> 18:56.733
my plan completely backfired.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.067
Now they're fighting
worse than ever.

18:59.133 --> 19:00.467
Oh, man,
do you think

19:00.533 --> 19:02.433
they're going
to get divorced?

19:02.500 --> 19:04.200
What?!

19:04.267 --> 19:05.867
I don't know. They could.

19:05.933 --> 19:07.200
But don't worry.

19:07.267 --> 19:09.200
Lots of people
get divorced.

19:09.267 --> 19:11.133
Mr. Dauterive
got divorced.

19:11.200 --> 19:16.933
( humming a waltz )

19:17.067 --> 19:20.267
( crying )

19:20.333 --> 19:21.833
the boy's
12 years old.

19:21.900 --> 19:24.667
What does he need clouds
on the wall for?

19:24.733 --> 19:26.267
And they don't even
look like clouds.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.433
They look like...

19:27.500 --> 19:29.467
What, hank?
what do they look like?

19:29.533 --> 19:33.367
Well, like... Like big white
blotches of bad painting.

19:33.433 --> 19:34.733
Well,
maybe to someone

19:34.800 --> 19:36.367
with absolutely
no imagination.

19:36.433 --> 19:38.467
I see all sorts of things.

19:38.533 --> 19:39.833
Well, if you ask me

19:39.900 --> 19:41.867
you've got
too much imagination.

19:41.933 --> 19:44.967
Everything's all
loop-de-loops
and flibbertigibbet.

19:45.067 --> 19:46.500
I live in
the real world

19:46.567 --> 19:47.933
where men
sell propane

19:48.067 --> 19:49.467
and propane
accessories.

19:49.533 --> 19:50.800
What do you do?

19:50.867 --> 19:53.133
I trade in ideas.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.800
I am a substitute teacher
and a professional muser.

19:56.867 --> 20:00.033
Yeah? Well, ideas don't
put food on the table.

20:00.033 --> 20:00.067
Yeah? Well, ideas don't
put food on the table.
oh, really?

20:00.067 --> 20:01.467
Oh, really?

20:01.533 --> 20:03.767
Well, ideas decide
how to prepare that food.

20:03.833 --> 20:06.333
And then propane
cooks it. I win.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.000
You don't win.

20:08.067 --> 20:09.633
You don't... You can't
just... You can't...

20:09.700 --> 20:10.633
I can't just what?

20:10.700 --> 20:11.633
You don't just...

20:11.700 --> 20:12.800
What? What?

20:12.867 --> 20:14.400
Where's your imagination now?

20:14.467 --> 20:16.533
Where are those precious ideas
when you need them, huh?

20:16.600 --> 20:17.867
Hank, you...

20:17.933 --> 20:19.133
You... Oh!

20:19.200 --> 20:20.633
oww!

20:20.700 --> 20:22.500
oww!

20:25.033 --> 20:31.133
( hank and peggy laughing )

20:32.567 --> 20:34.833
what's going on?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.167
You stopped fighting.

20:36.233 --> 20:37.500
That's right.

20:37.567 --> 20:39.167
Everything's just
fine now, honey.

20:39.233 --> 20:40.667
But how?

20:40.733 --> 20:43.800
Well, uh... Your mother
kicked me in the shin

20:43.867 --> 20:45.600
I kicked her back

20:45.667 --> 20:49.500
and, well... Well,
that's pretty much it.

20:49.567 --> 20:51.833
That doesn't make any sense.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.167
Well, sure, it does.

20:53.233 --> 20:56.400
See, I was mad,
your mother was madder

20:56.467 --> 20:58.433
and we sort of... Um...

20:58.500 --> 21:02.167
Aw, heck, I guess
it doesn't make any sense

21:02.233 --> 21:04.167
but I guess
it doesn't have to.

21:04.233 --> 21:07.167
There are just some
things you can't explain.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.533
That's right.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.833
You're not even trying.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.167
Listen up, bobby.

21:12.233 --> 21:13.500
I tell you what--

21:13.567 --> 21:15.467
Why don't you sit with us here

21:15.533 --> 21:17.733
and we'll watch
the clouds go by.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.233
Okay.

21:21.767 --> 21:25.667
Hey, now, see that one
over there looks like a, uh...

21:25.733 --> 21:28.167
Uh... A propane tank.

21:28.233 --> 21:30.167
Or a gummi bear.

21:30.233 --> 21:32.700
Very good...
both of you.

21:32.767 --> 21:35.233
Hank:
hey, that one looks
like a propane tank, too.

21:35.300 --> 21:38.167
And you know what those little
ones over there look like?

21:38.233 --> 21:39.667
Bobby:
propane accessories?

21:39.733 --> 21:42.167
Hank:
yes, yes, but which ones?

21:42.233 --> 21:44.500
Bobby:
uh... Spatula?

21:44.567 --> 21:47.733
Hank:
now you're just guessing. Peggy?

21:47.800 --> 21:50.300
Peggy:
it is a grill brush.

21:53.133 --> 21:57.200
And now... The pinata
of death revealed.

21:57.267 --> 21:59.900
As soon as our volunteer
gets in the burro

22:00.067 --> 22:02.300
a flap beneath the tail opens.

22:02.367 --> 22:06.067
She steps out and puts on
a poncho and sombrero

22:06.133 --> 22:08.067
and dances offstage.

22:08.133 --> 22:09.433
The fire?

22:09.500 --> 22:10.333
( chuckles )

22:10.400 --> 22:11.733
just a diversion.

22:11.800 --> 22:15.300
It appears our volunteer
has vanished. Has she?

22:15.367 --> 22:17.133
Hardly.

22:17.200 --> 22:21.067
And that is the secret
behind the pinata of death.

22:21.067 --> 22:23.067
Please don't tell my dad.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.733
Dale:
you are so clueless.
ha-ha.
