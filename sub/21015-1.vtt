14:52.392 --> 14:54.792
Why didn't you stick

14:56.162 --> 14:58.062
After you were arrested,

14:59.499 --> 15:03.334
the protestant lads
didn't show up.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.203
They took it hard.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.240
They were very surprised.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.012
That was it for me.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.949
They use it
as a community center now.

15:28.662 --> 15:30.495
He's clear.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.510

16:06.433 --> 16:08.299
Thirty-two.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.751

Why, danny?

16:35.161 --> 16:37.362
I just want to set
the record straight.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.432

16:43.636 --> 16:47.138
It's across the river.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.374
<i>Another fuckin' bomb.</i>

17:28.214 --> 17:30.448

18:17.764 --> 18:20.565
What the hell

19:13.386 --> 19:16.621
- Fine.

19:22.162 --> 19:25.202
- Good behavior.
- You were never accused of that before.

19:27.700 --> 19:31.335
- You missed the boat, scrapper.
- I'd no watch.

19:34.440 --> 19:38.576
You know joe wanted you out of town.
This is my home.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.778
You're gonna live here? Aye.

19:42.215 --> 19:45.383
You're a strange man, danny.

19:45.385 --> 19:50.621
All you had to do was walk
across a prison corridor...

19:50.623 --> 19:55.326
And shake hands with some of
your old friends in the I.RA.

19:55.328 --> 19:59.897
Snubbin' people is not nice.

19:59.899 --> 20:04.702
But you never named names, and that's
why you're a healthy man. Understand?

20:07.674 --> 20:09.640
What are you lookin' at?

20:12.579 --> 20:15.913
It's not my fault you got caught.
You should have run away.

20:22.288 --> 20:24.322
Why is he back? <i> I don't know.</i>

20:25.959 --> 20:29.080
Why the fuck should I know?
Is it maggie?

20:31.531 --> 20:33.598
No, he wouldn't have
the balls for that.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.433
So you say.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.845
No, he knows he'd get
a fuckin' bullet in the head.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.727
Say, "bye-bye." Bye-bye.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.824
Just wait a wee minute there.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.759

21:13.339 --> 21:15.406
<i>Ah, take time. Take your time.</i>

21:25.618 --> 21:27.785
Young flynn, isn't it?

21:48.508 --> 21:50.941
What happened to the ring?

21:50.943 --> 21:53.711
That packed out years ago.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.047
I think it's stuck
under thon stage there.

22:11.397 --> 22:13.597
<i>There's a man standing there.</i>

22:22.342 --> 22:24.975
There's been an approach...

22:24.977 --> 22:28.546
To the community center.

22:28.548 --> 22:32.483
Danny flynn wants to set up
a gym there.

27:06.892 --> 27:09.727
<i>Put those punches.</i>

27:09.729 --> 27:11.795
<i>That's it.</i>
<i>And again. And again.</i>

27:13.265 --> 27:15.099
<i>That's it.</i>

27:16.669 --> 27:18.869
<i>That's it! Good man.</i>

27:27.413 --> 27:29.279
Hey.

27:31.283 --> 27:34.051
I see you've put up the ring.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.253
Aye. Looks great.

27:47.099 --> 27:50.367
Well, sweetheart,

27:54.840 --> 27:58.075
did you die just so joe hamill
could sell us out?

27:58.077 --> 28:00.238
Hmm? <i> Hmm?</i>

28:01.080 --> 28:03.013
Nothin'.

28:04.717 --> 28:06.750
Just talkin' to myself.

28:12.892 --> 28:16.994
12:00 noon. Peace in ireland.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.439
- Ma, it's the cease-fire.
<i>- There are continuing scenes...</i>

28:28.441 --> 28:30.808
<i>Of celebration on</i>
<i>the streets of west belfast,</i>

28:30.810 --> 28:33.877
as 12:00 noon brought the
long-awaited I.RA. Cease-fire.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.814
Protestant spokespersons
opposed immediate movement...

28:36.816 --> 28:38.216
<i>On the release of prisoners.</i>

28:42.922 --> 28:44.822
You get to know who the
troublemakers are quick enough.

28:44.824 --> 28:48.892
Just keep an eye on the tables.

28:48.894 --> 28:53.864
No one comes into the city center after dark,
so you'll have to work till 6:00 or so.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.799
You ever been to london? Aye.

28:57.136 --> 28:59.803
I got a few contacts there.
Come on.

29:07.880 --> 29:11.014
Ike, where's danny?

29:11.016 --> 29:13.183
He's in the kitchen.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.447
What's goin' on, danny?

29:45.985 --> 29:46.945
What do you mean?

29:51.390 --> 29:55.325
I haven't seen you in 14 years,

29:55.327 --> 29:59.196
and now you're right
next door to me every day.

29:59.198 --> 30:04.468
And when I do see you, all I get
from you is the odd grunt.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.590
Do you not think
that's strange?

30:15.181 --> 30:17.447
Aye, it is strange.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.850
Oh, forget it, danny.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.360
<i>Come on. Pick it up.</i>

30:34.567 --> 30:36.967
<i>That's it. Good man.</i>

30:40.539 --> 30:42.973
<i>And again. Move him about.</i>

30:42.975 --> 30:46.009
<i>Beautiful. And again.</i>

30:46.011 --> 30:48.145
<i>Get the punches in. That's it.</i>

30:48.147 --> 30:51.315
<i>And again.</i>
<i>Keep your guard up, danny!</i>

30:52.885 --> 30:55.285
Danny, come on in.
Look at these.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.425
Look.

31:01.427 --> 31:03.360
There's maclean.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.539
"Holy family
sweep the all irelands."

31:19.044 --> 31:23.647
What a waste of life.

31:23.649 --> 31:28.018
<i>Six of them dead. Why the hell
did you get mixed up with them?</i>

31:32.191 --> 31:35.626
The police were burning people
out of their homes, ike.

31:35.628 --> 31:39.963
Soldiers shootin' people on the corner.
Why the hell do you think I got involved?

31:39.965 --> 31:42.532
<i>I don't know.</i>

31:42.534 --> 31:44.301
What's in the cupboard?

31:52.244 --> 31:56.613
- Ah, it's locked.
- We're lockin' up, lads.

31:56.615 --> 31:59.935
There's only odds and ends in there
belongin' to the community center.

32:22.975 --> 32:24.608
Fuckin' semtex.

33:24.403 --> 33:27.637
These are explosives, birdy. Why the fuck didn't
you tell me he was rootin' around in here?

33:27.639 --> 33:30.107
Kept an eye on him.

33:40.419 --> 33:42.619
The lock's broken.

33:47.793 --> 33:50.627
<i>It's gone.</i>

33:59.138 --> 34:01.671
Danny.

34:01.673 --> 34:03.740
Can I have a word with you?

34:18.791 --> 34:21.558
You're in trouble.
What did you do?

34:26.297 --> 34:29.266
I found some stuff. Semtex.

34:30.636 --> 34:33.770
Under the stage?

34:33.772 --> 34:35.405
Bastards.

34:37.743 --> 34:40.510
- Well, where is it now?
- In the river.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.748
Well, why didn't you give it
back to my father?

34:46.418 --> 34:48.458
So they can kill more
innocent people?

34:49.721 --> 34:52.241
What do you mean,
innocent people?

34:52.690 --> 34:54.791
I mean innocent people, maggie.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.823
Do you want to get
yourself killed, danny?

35:00.599 --> 35:02.399
Not particularly.

35:04.570 --> 35:07.537
- Why did you really come back?
- What do you mean?

35:11.443 --> 35:14.111
I don't believe you just
came back here to box.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.181
If you ask me
to leave, I'll go.

35:18.183 --> 35:20.417
If <i> I</i> ask you to leave.

35:23.555 --> 35:27.491
Well, how far
can you go, danny?

35:27.493 --> 35:31.728
Turn around, start walking, and
when you've walked for 14 years,

35:31.730 --> 35:34.264
then stop and think
about what you did to me.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.502
I did it for ya.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.906
Oh, my god.

35:51.617 --> 35:54.284
I'm sorry.

35:54.286 --> 35:56.453
<i>The next train</i>
<i>from platform one...</i>

35:56.455 --> 35:59.623
<i>Will be the 10:50 service</i>
<i>to londonderry...</i>

36:06.532 --> 36:08.798
I think we're safe enough here.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.867
Ah, we're fine.
Don't worry about us.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.736
Thank you.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.826
You used to talk to me, danny.

36:32.691 --> 36:37.194
You used to make me laugh.
Oh, go on, make me laugh.

36:39.898 --> 36:42.232
Am I not funny?

36:42.234 --> 36:43.934
No.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.878
Talk to me, danny.

37:01.954 --> 37:03.987
Talk to you in my mind.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.758
What do you mean?

37:16.301 --> 37:18.568
In prison, you get used
to silence, you know?

37:25.444 --> 37:28.812
I mean, at first, you, you hold on
to all the old voices in your head...

37:31.383 --> 37:34.818
kids you knew at school,
old friends and such.

37:34.820 --> 37:39.756
Well, after a while,
those voices start to fade,

37:39.758 --> 37:44.394
and you end up talkin' to yourself
for a bit of company, you know?

37:48.300 --> 37:50.267
And then something
strange happens.

37:54.339 --> 37:57.907
It's as if even your own
voice doesn't belong there...

37:57.909 --> 38:00.343
In the silence.

38:00.345 --> 38:01.945
It's unwelcome.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.319
Go on, danny.

38:09.321 --> 38:12.589
Well, in the end,

38:12.591 --> 38:14.891
it's the silence
becomes your best friend.

38:20.766 --> 38:22.999
And in the quiet,
a face will come to you, and,

38:25.737 --> 38:30.707
<i>and you talk to that person</i>
<i>without sayin' anything, and...</i>

38:35.047 --> 38:38.648
Gee, I'm not makin' any sense.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.017
Never make any fuckin' sense.

38:42.921 --> 38:45.088
What are you sayin', danny?

38:48.427 --> 38:51.828
I've lived with your face
in silence for 14 years, maggie.

38:53.699 --> 38:56.633
You know, it's hard
to talk to the real you.

38:58.904 --> 39:02.072
I'm not who I was.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.879
Try the elbow. Set down on the way.
That's it.

39:09.881 --> 39:12.716
Once more. That's it.
Snap on your jab.

39:12.718 --> 39:15.585
That's it. One more.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.987
Come on. One-two! And again.

39:17.989 --> 39:20.423
<i>And again.</i> He wants to join.

39:22.661 --> 39:24.728
He's the boss.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.496
<i>One-two.</i> Ike!

39:28.667 --> 39:31.501
- Shadowbox.
- He wants to join.

39:31.503 --> 39:33.503
Use the rest of the ring now.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.808
Come here.

39:45.617 --> 39:49.177
No way, missus. Who are
you to talk, ike weir?

39:53.024 --> 39:55.458
Make him have a blood test.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.827
If he's clear and
he stays off the junk,

39:57.829 --> 39:59.662
he can join.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.967
<i>Keep your head movin' now.</i>

40:03.969 --> 40:05.769
That's it. Duck and weave.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.604
Bob and weave.

40:11.576 --> 40:14.878
Well done.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.480
Keep on the move. That's it.

40:17.482 --> 40:20.950
Come on. Hold on. Thumbs out. That's it.
Elbows in. Nice and tight.

40:20.952 --> 40:22.752
Good. Very good.

40:24.689 --> 40:27.190
Danny. Look at these.

40:29.895 --> 40:33.430
Headgear's gone.
You can't spar with these.

40:34.633 --> 40:37.000
Look at that.

40:37.002 --> 40:38.701
<i>And he didn't do it?</i>

40:38.703 --> 40:40.537
<i>Shh, shh, shh!</i>

40:43.809 --> 40:46.976
- what does that mean, bootsy?
- What?

40:46.978 --> 40:49.712
"Nonsectarian."

40:51.983 --> 40:53.903
Catholics
and protestants together.

40:57.222 --> 40:59.889
What about the jews, bootsy?
And the arabs?

41:01.560 --> 41:03.660
<i>And the muslims?</i>

41:03.662 --> 41:05.662
I suppose they can come too,
if they want.

41:19.478 --> 41:21.778
Liam, move in!

41:24.015 --> 41:26.049
Come on!

41:28.753 --> 41:31.921
Holy family's
always been nonsectarian.

41:31.923 --> 41:34.691
Protestants
and catholics together.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.659
Write that down!

41:46.838 --> 41:48.872
And the winner is...

41:48.874 --> 41:51.241
<i>In the red CORNER:</i>

41:51.243 --> 41:53.810
<i>Doyle from</i>

<i>belfast.</i>

41:56.248 --> 41:59.516

41:59.518 --> 42:01.038
Great fight. Great fight.

42:03.688 --> 42:05.955
Okay, danny. Let's go.

42:05.957 --> 42:08.124
Don't forget. It's your
first fight in a long time.

42:08.126 --> 42:12.128
You're gonna learn a lot.

42:20.805 --> 42:23.940
<i>Ladies and gentleman, can I</i>
<i>have your attention, please?</i>

42:23.942 --> 42:26.809
I want to say

<i>Of the many people that gave
their lives in the troubles,</i>

42:30.882 --> 42:33.182

<i>are in the hall tonight,</i>

43:44.889 --> 43:46.923
and this is their first night
in the club...

43:46.925 --> 43:49.959
Since the troubles began
28 years ago.

43:52.364 --> 43:56.833
<i>And I'd like you all</i>
<i>to welcome them back.</i>

44:07.379 --> 44:10.013
Did you know that was
gonna happen? No.

44:10.015 --> 44:12.715
Sentimental shite.

44:12.717 --> 44:14.250
<i>Round one.</i>

44:18.356 --> 44:21.024
<i>Danny! Balance now.

<i>Hit him! Come on!</i>

45:14.412 --> 45:16.693
Flynn should get the nobel
peace prize for boxin'.

<i>Stay off the ropes!</i>

45:25.824 --> 45:28.224

Hold him, danny!

46:53.545 --> 46:55.812
<i>Come on, danny! Come on!</i>

46:55.814 --> 46:58.174
Stay on your feet, lad!
Stay on your feet!

47:02.520 --> 47:06.022
<i>Don't go down!</i>
<i>Stay on your feet, danny!</i>

<i>Twenty seconds!</i>

47:08.359 --> 47:10.426
<i>Stay on your feet, danny!</i>

47:27.078 --> 47:30.046
He doesn't look
much like a quitter to me.

47:30.048 --> 47:32.582
Danny! Danny! Danny!

47:32.584 --> 47:36.586
Danny! Danny! Danny!

48:00.411 --> 48:02.578
What was that about, scrapper?

48:05.250 --> 48:08.810
What do you mean? Those were powerful
emotions you stirred up tonight.

48:10.555 --> 48:14.924
What are you up to?
I was just boxin'.

48:16.928 --> 48:20.062
It's not just boxin', danny.
It's a fuckin' statement...

48:20.064 --> 48:21.984
standin' there
gettin' your head knocked off.

48:24.903 --> 48:26.402
What was that about?

48:31.576 --> 48:33.377
I want the stuff back,
scrapper.

48:37.282 --> 48:41.083
What stuff?

48:41.085 --> 48:44.487
All right, danny. Play it
whatever way you want.

48:47.225 --> 48:50.386
Fourteen years wasn't enough to
teach you then. Was it, lad?

48:52.597 --> 48:55.031
- What'd he want?
- Nothin', ike.

48:57.135 --> 48:59.068
Good.

49:01.306 --> 49:04.206
He ruined
your life once already.

49:04.208 --> 49:07.128
<i>Don't give him a second chance.
</i> I won't.

49:11.215 --> 49:14.150
You should have put him away
the first time.

49:14.152 --> 49:18.220
You did him a favor.
He'll never forgive you for it.

49:20.291 --> 49:21.958
<i>I.d., please.</i>

49:21.960 --> 49:23.693
I.d.?

49:27.165 --> 49:29.031
Thank you.

49:42.513 --> 49:45.081
I'm not too sure
about this, maggie.

49:45.083 --> 49:48.643
Well, it's safer than being
seen together in west belfast.

49:54.258 --> 49:56.359
Why didn't you ask me to wait?

49:59.630 --> 50:02.598
I would have waited. Don't be sayin' that.
Fourteen years, maggie.

50:02.600 --> 50:06.369
I would have waited.
You were only 16.

50:06.371 --> 50:11.440
Did you not trust me? How the hell could I?
I was mad in love with ya.

50:11.442 --> 50:15.111
And I wanted
to keep it that way.

50:15.113 --> 50:18.214
Not have it eaten up
day by day.

50:18.216 --> 50:22.618
So you made the decision
for both of us?

50:22.620 --> 50:25.221
- You made your own decisions too, maggie.
- What do you mean?

50:25.223 --> 50:27.390
You married my best friend,
for god's sake.

50:29.327 --> 50:32.161
Well, did you expect me
to remain faithful to you?

50:33.765 --> 50:38.034
I suppose I did.
I thought I was bein' romantic.

50:38.036 --> 50:41.604
Mmm. Givin' you
your freedom or somethin'.

50:41.606 --> 50:44.573
You were giving me my freedom, but you
wanted me to stay faithful to you?

50:44.575 --> 50:47.543
I was only 19.

50:47.545 --> 50:49.245
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

50:51.049 --> 50:53.249
Shake my hand. What?

50:53.251 --> 50:56.585
Shake my hand, danny boy flynn.
Billy patterson, bantamweight.

50:56.587 --> 50:59.121
- Jesus, billy! How are you doin'?
- Good, good.

50:59.123 --> 51:01.557
<i>I'm doin' fine. Don't look now.</i>

51:01.559 --> 51:04.260
But there's a car behind ya,

51:04.262 --> 51:08.364
and the last catholic boy who was in
that car didn't die a happy death.

51:08.366 --> 51:11.607
So I'll walk you to the peace
line together. Let's go.

51:19.377 --> 51:23.479
Bye-bye, maggie.
Good luck, danny.

51:23.481 --> 51:26.122
Stop by and do a bit of
training sometime. Will do.

51:43.267 --> 51:45.868
What's wrong? I don't
take gear from cops.

51:45.870 --> 51:49.171
Why? 'Cause they won't let
my dad out of prison.

51:49.173 --> 51:50.813
- Yeah, go on!
- <i> That's great, reggie.</i>

51:57.281 --> 51:59.482
What about you, liam?

52:19.537 --> 52:21.237
<i>Come on, lads.</i>
<i>Come on. Photograph time.</i>

52:21.239 --> 52:25.241
What's all this? It's a gift.

52:27.278 --> 52:30.880
- A gift from who?
- Community relations.

52:33.451 --> 52:35.371
<i>All right.</i> Come here.

52:36.521 --> 52:38.821
<i>Group together like that.</i>

52:45.530 --> 52:49.598
- community relations?
- Aye. Reggie bell.

52:49.600 --> 52:53.569
This stuff is from the cops,
ike, and we can't accept it.

52:56.941 --> 53:00.609
Listen, these kids have barely
got shoes on their feet.

53:00.611 --> 53:03.479
Some of them come here in rags.

53:03.481 --> 53:06.615
Look at them now.
They look great.

53:06.617 --> 53:09.885
Now I don't give a fuckin' shite who these
togs come from. They're on their backs.

53:09.887 --> 53:12.888
All right.
<i>They're not comin' off.</i>

53:12.890 --> 53:17.393
<i>We simply can't negotiate until the
terrorists lay down their arms.</i>

53:17.395 --> 53:22.598
The police are protestant. They're
not welcome in catholic areas.

53:22.600 --> 53:26.535
In contrast, it seems the whole of
belfast, catholic and protestant,

53:26.537 --> 53:31.574
is welcome at the recently reopened,
nonsectarian holy family boxing club.

53:31.576 --> 53:34.677
Takin' gear from the cops. <i> The boys
from the club recently received...</i>

53:34.679 --> 53:36.712
<i>A generous donation</i>
<i>of equipment.</i>

53:36.714 --> 53:39.815
<i>And danny flynn,</i>
<i>who fights out of holy family,</i>

53:39.817 --> 53:42.857
<i>has signed up for a rematch with
eddie carroll at the city center.</i>

54:36.607 --> 54:39.041
<i>Get them!</i>
<i>Get those sons of bitches!</i>

54:48.586 --> 54:51.820
Who fired at danny flynn
last night, harry?

54:51.822 --> 54:54.390
I don't know.
My units shoot to kill.

54:54.392 --> 54:56.058
You're in charge
of the district.

54:56.060 --> 54:58.594
No.

54:58.596 --> 55:00.963
I report to you.
Did you see this?

55:05.002 --> 55:08.070
He's fillin' people's heads
full of shit, joe.

55:08.072 --> 55:10.572
<i>"Leave the fighting to danny" Means
that all the people who are in prison,</i>

55:10.574 --> 55:13.409
who died, who didn't
surrender to the brits...

55:13.411 --> 55:17.346
that means that their sacrifices aren't
worth a lousy fuckin' boxin' match.

55:17.348 --> 55:20.482
<i>He's spreadin' dissent, joe.</i>

55:20.484 --> 55:23.485
Maybe you're the one who's
spreadin' dissent, harry.

55:28.926 --> 55:32.995
I'm trying to hold it together in a district
full of junkies, thieves and losers,

55:32.997 --> 55:35.631
<i>while all he's trying to say is that
everything will be all right...</i>

55:35.633 --> 55:38.467
<i>If the catholics and protestants
will hold hands together.</i>

55:39.737 --> 55:42.538
It's shit, isn't it, joe?

55:42.540 --> 55:45.941
Is it, harry?

55:45.943 --> 55:48.510
Shit?

55:48.512 --> 55:50.913
You know we're gonna have
to live with them sometime.

55:50.915 --> 55:54.083
- Who's "them"?
- The protestants, harry.

55:54.085 --> 55:56.485
The other half
of the population.

56:01.559 --> 56:05.627
You're never going to be
treated as an equal, joe.

56:05.629 --> 56:08.897
Not if we keep bombin' 'em, no.

56:08.899 --> 56:11.467
I don't see any PO.W.'s
comin' home, joe.

56:11.469 --> 56:15.871
Well, last night
didn't help, harry.

56:15.873 --> 56:18.974
It didn't help at all.

56:18.976 --> 56:21.777
<i>Keep it goin', bootsy.</i>
<i>Keep it goin'.</i>

56:21.779 --> 56:24.480
And again.

56:24.482 --> 56:26.715
<i>Throw your combinations, danny!
</i> And again.

56:26.717 --> 56:28.684
Let's go. And again.

56:28.686 --> 56:30.853
<i>One-two!</i>

56:30.855 --> 56:33.155
<i>Use the jab!</i> One-two!

56:33.157 --> 56:34.990
- Danny.
- <i> Come on! Again!</i>

56:40.998 --> 56:43.799
That was a warning shot
they fired at you.

56:43.801 --> 56:45.801
<i>I'll see you later.</i> Aye.

57:04.755 --> 57:07.155
You know, we can't keep doin'
what we're doin', maggie.

57:10.461 --> 57:14.496
What are we doing?

57:14.498 --> 57:17.099
You know what I'm sayin'.
Come on.

57:18.969 --> 57:22.538
Yeah. You're right.

57:34.752 --> 57:36.585
Give us a hug.

57:44.929 --> 57:46.862
You're a dangerous
fuckin' woman.

58:16.160 --> 58:19.194
You talked about voices in your head.
I couldn't stop them.

58:19.196 --> 58:23.098
I thought my head would burst.

58:23.100 --> 58:26.535
And the only thing
that kept me sane...

58:28.639 --> 58:31.039
ah, it doesn't matter now.
Go on. I'm listening.

58:31.041 --> 58:33.809
It's not fair.
Just finish it up, maggie.

58:33.811 --> 58:37.713
It was the sound
of your voice saying,

58:40.017 --> 58:42.377
"everything's gonna
be all right."

58:43.621 --> 58:46.255
Geez, I never said that.

58:47.725 --> 58:50.893
Over and over again in my head.

58:52.129 --> 58:54.449
"Everything is gonna
be all right."

59:13.217 --> 59:16.718
Well, this is, this is okay.
This is, this is all right.

59:18.055 --> 59:21.256
What? What is this?

59:24.929 --> 59:28.830
This is us.
You don't put a name on it.

59:56.794 --> 59:59.194
Who is it? It's danny.
Can I come in?

01:00:02.232 --> 01:00:05.834
It's very late, danny.

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:08.716
You shouldn't be here. It's not safe.
I know.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:17.613
This is fuckin' ridiculous,
you know?

01:00:28.993 --> 01:00:32.894
All this talk, maggie, you know?
We're kiddin' ourselves.

01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:34.796
I love you.

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:38.800
There's nothin' else to say.

01:00:41.005 --> 01:00:42.838
We're not kids anymore, danny.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.673
No, we aren't.

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:50.345
You're so fuckin' beautiful.

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:56.885
For 14 years I was locked up.

01:00:56.887 --> 01:01:00.122
Well, my feelings were
locked up inside of me.

01:01:05.429 --> 01:01:07.362
And when I got
in the ring again,

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:09.831
you can't imagine the relief
it was to feel the pain...

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:14.736
to be back in the world again.

01:01:14.738 --> 01:01:18.018
I can give you up in my head, but
my body's cryin' out for you.

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:22.110
Don't.

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:34.756
Be with me.

01:01:35.826 --> 01:01:37.893
No.

01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:40.362
Be with me.

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:45.000
I'm going mad, danny.

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:50.272
I have a scream inside of me
day and night.

01:01:50.274 --> 01:01:53.375
Liam's upstairs.

01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:01.149
Have I said too much?

01:02:01.151 --> 01:02:03.452
No.

01:02:03.454 --> 01:02:05.821
No.

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:10.125
But...

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:14.730
I think you've said
enough for now.

01:02:19.937 --> 01:02:22.304
I think you'd better go. Okay.

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:45.761
Is my da comin' home or not?

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:48.530
Don't build up
your hopes, liam.

01:02:48.532 --> 01:02:50.932
You said the prisoners
were comin' home.

01:03:02.179 --> 01:03:04.513
What's wrong?

01:03:06.383 --> 01:03:09.551
We're this close to a deal,

01:03:09.553 --> 01:03:12.053
but I'm gettin' no concessions
on the prisoners.

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:16.525
It's as though the brits
want the cease-fire to fail.

01:03:18.862 --> 01:03:21.329
Harry says the only thing
they respond to is violence.

01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:28.338

Did he say
he didn't want to come?

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:15.690

Okay, boys, let's go.
Follow my instructions.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.674
Protect yourselves,
and shake hands.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.680
Stop! Go to a neutral corner.

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:37.719
<i>One! Two! Three! Four!</i>

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:40.388

<i>One, two, three,</i>

<i>You're out!</i>

Thanks very much. Well done.

01:08:54.197 --> 01:08:57.131
Great night
for the city of belfast.

01:08:57.134 --> 01:08:58.867
The crowd will be comin' out now,
catholics and protestants together.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.801
The band will lead them
off down the street.

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:03.171
I'd like you to get as many
good pictures as you can.

01:09:03.173 --> 01:09:06.674
Yea! Danny! Danny! Danny!

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:12.279
They'll be coming out together, so you
can clear the barriers away. Okay.

01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:15.350
<i>Danny! Danny! Danny!</i>

01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:45.712
Keep calm. You can all see
where your exits are.

01:09:45.715 --> 01:09:49.651
<i>Don't panic. Get up slowly.</i>

01:09:49.653 --> 01:09:52.554
<i>Leave the building.</i>

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:55.757

<i>Jesus! Come on.</i>
<i>Let's move it. Move it!</i>

<i>Go out through the main exit.</i>

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:21.316
- cop killer!
- <i> There's no need to panic.</i>

01:10:21.318 --> 01:10:23.851
Catholic bastards! Bastards!
<i>Follow the exit signs.</i>

01:10:23.853 --> 01:10:25.987
You're all right, son.

01:10:25.989 --> 01:10:28.957
- Kill him! Kill him!
- They killed a cop!

01:10:28.959 --> 01:10:31.359
You're okay.
Take his hand now, son.

01:10:31.361 --> 01:10:32.927
Keep calm.

01:10:32.929 --> 01:10:35.630
Watch yourself now.
That's right.

01:10:35.632 --> 01:10:37.999
- Good, lad.
- Oh, daddy! Oh, daddy, no!

01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:39.434
<i>You'll be okay! Daddy!</i>

01:10:39.436 --> 01:10:41.569
Quit pushin'! Dad!

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:44.472
Robert! Robert!

There's a kid dyin' in there!

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:49.844
<i>Give him some space!</i>
<i>There's a kid dyin' in there!</i>

01:10:57.887 --> 01:11:00.421
Stop it! Stop it!

01:11:05.629 --> 01:11:06.894
Irish pigs!

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:13.001
Gary!

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:33.655
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

01:11:33.657 --> 01:11:34.789
Aaah!

Run, ned! Run!
Come on! Run, will ya?

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:51.706
Where the fuck were you?
What are these for?

01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:53.608
They're the keys
to the gym. Come on.

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:56.010
Where's the petrol?

01:12:02.619 --> 01:12:06.521
Should never have taken
that gear from him.

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:12.560
Don't even think about it, ike.

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:16.631
He's a wife and
three children, danny.

01:12:16.633 --> 01:12:19.867
Anything that
belongs to the cops.

01:12:19.869 --> 01:12:22.603
We'll burn it outside.

01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:31.646
I'm not takin' that outside.
Why not?

01:12:31.648 --> 01:12:35.917
'Cause, liam,
the brits are everywhere.

01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:40.888
We'll burn it here.

01:12:49.432 --> 01:12:51.699
Stop messin', ned.

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:55.103
Aaah! Mickey!

01:12:55.105 --> 01:12:58.072
- Mickey!
- Aaah!

01:12:58.074 --> 01:13:00.074
Mickey, roll over! Oh, geez!

01:13:00.076 --> 01:13:02.677
Get him! Mickey, get up!

01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:05.380
Aaah!

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:10.084
<i>Gotta get outta here!</i>
<i>Let's get out! Come on!</i>

01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:12.820
Let's get out!
Run, mickey! Get out!

01:13:12.822 --> 01:13:15.957
The gym is on fire!

01:13:15.959 --> 01:13:20.094
The gym's on fire!
The gym's on fire!

01:13:20.096 --> 01:13:22.463
<i>The gym's on fire!</i>

01:13:38.047 --> 01:13:38.547
Oh!

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:47.889
<i>Get away from the building!</i>

01:13:49.826 --> 01:13:51.759
Get the pictures!

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:54.495
<i>This is for your own safety!</i>

01:13:57.901 --> 01:14:01.035
- you'd better leave right now!
- Come on, ike!

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:03.070
Time to get out!

01:14:09.145 --> 01:14:12.213
You can't go in there!
I work in there!

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:14.215
<i>Step back! I work in
there, and I have to get...</i>

01:14:14.217 --> 01:14:15.149
it's not safe!

01:14:19.856 --> 01:14:22.089
<i>Get away from the building!</i>

01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:25.092
Serves youse bloody well right for
takin' the stuff from the police!

01:14:56.559 --> 01:14:59.260
I'm in the middle
of negotiations,

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:03.531
and you let off
this fuckin' bomb.

01:15:03.533 --> 01:15:06.868
What did you achieve by it?
You achieved zero. Zero?

01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:12.540
Grow up. Stop livin' in the past
and get your head into the future.

01:15:12.542 --> 01:15:17.144
You can keep goin'. You can
split this organization in two.

01:15:17.146 --> 01:15:20.648
But you're gonna have to accept the consequences.
What consequences?

01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:22.891
You know what
fuckin' consequences.

01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:28.256
You don't have
all the guns, joe.

01:15:28.258 --> 01:15:32.727
A lot of the active servicemen won't
accept this peace bullshit anymore.

01:15:32.729 --> 01:15:34.795
Are you threatenin' me?

01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:36.864
You're goin' soft, joe.

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:39.233
Ya think so?

01:15:39.235 --> 01:15:42.603
You had men in prison...

01:15:42.605 --> 01:15:46.040
Who starved themselves
to death for you, joe.

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:49.277
Ten of them.
Now you have danny boy flynn...

01:15:49.279 --> 01:15:51.979
<i>Wanderin' around the place makin' a
mockery of everything you stood for,</i>

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:54.982
and you don't even see it.

01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:57.552
But a child can see it, joe.

01:15:57.554 --> 01:15:59.220
A wee innocent child
can see the truth.

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:02.723
What are you talkin' about?

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:05.259
Why don't you ask liam
why he burnt down the gym?

01:16:17.707 --> 01:16:19.307
I just follow orders.

01:16:22.145 --> 01:16:25.313
He's way out of control, joe.

01:16:25.315 --> 01:16:28.149
<i>Hello, maggie.</i>

01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:30.184
<i>Hi.</i>

01:16:30.186 --> 01:16:32.620
It's your da. <i> All right.</i>

01:16:32.622 --> 01:16:34.322
Joe.

01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:49.704
What's wrong?

01:16:49.706 --> 01:16:53.107
I don't want to lose you.

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:56.611
Sure you never will.

01:16:56.613 --> 01:16:58.679
You've got to be
above reproach.

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:09.757
Tell me... tell me
you don't love danny flynn.

01:17:14.998 --> 01:17:16.797
You've got to get rid of him.

01:17:24.073 --> 01:17:26.314
What are you talkin' about?

01:17:34.217 --> 01:17:36.784
We've done nothin' wrong.
<i>That's not the point.</i>

01:17:36.786 --> 01:17:39.654
Everybody thinks you did.
<i>Well, to hell with them.</i>

01:17:39.656 --> 01:17:42.089
To hell with 'em.

01:17:42.091 --> 01:17:47.395
<i>Maggie, liam burned down</i>
<i>the gym.</i>

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:52.099
Liam?

01:18:02.412 --> 01:18:04.945
Where is he? Upstairs.

01:18:14.157 --> 01:18:17.058
What the hell did you
think you were doing?

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:21.028
I saw ya. I saw ya with him.

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:28.002
You're gonna run away
with him, aren't ya?

01:18:33.309 --> 01:18:36.210
No.

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:40.314
I'm gonna stay
right here with you.

01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:42.483
I don't want to
see him ever again.

01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:47.354
Oh, liam.

01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:49.423
Liam?

01:18:57.366 --> 01:19:01.235
<i>Leave him, maggie.</i>

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:03.170
He's suffered enough.

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.781
He's suffered enough?

01:19:14.884 --> 01:19:16.784
Jesus.

01:19:21.023 --> 01:19:25.493
My marriage was over
before liam was even born.

01:19:32.235 --> 01:19:34.769
I'm the prisoner here.

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:39.073
<i>You and your politics</i>
<i>have made sure of that.</i>

01:19:39.075 --> 01:19:41.542
All I wanted was for you
to have a good marriage.

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:46.180
Like you and my mother? Yes.

01:19:46.182 --> 01:19:51.285
Do you know how much it cost her to smile
every time you walked through the front door?

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:54.388
She lived her whole bloody life
worried to death. And for what?

01:19:57.059 --> 01:20:00.561
Will ya look me in the eye
and tell me for what?

01:20:02.799 --> 01:20:05.900
I suppose she
believed in me, maggie.

01:20:05.902 --> 01:20:10.571
She thought the ground
that you walked on was sacred.

01:20:10.573 --> 01:20:13.474
So did I.

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:17.945
I'm not going to lose danny.

01:20:17.947 --> 01:20:19.980
Then you'll have
to tell him to go.

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:22.183
Why?

01:20:22.185 --> 01:20:25.085
I can't protect him, maggie.

01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:32.326
You'll have to get rid of him, or
you'll find him in a pool of blood.

01:20:34.964 --> 01:20:36.831
God help you.

01:20:46.309 --> 01:20:50.377
God help you, father.

01:20:56.953 --> 01:20:59.453
Maggie, come in.

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:06.961
I have to talk to you, danny.

01:21:06.963 --> 01:21:09.296
Want a cup of tea? <i> Aye.</i>

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:30.584
Danny, I... I have
something to say to you.

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:37.892
I've been up all night, and I...

01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:39.593
I've written ya a letter.

01:21:48.471 --> 01:21:51.205
"Dear danny,

01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:55.509
"it's taken me 14 years
to learn to live without you,

01:21:55.511 --> 01:22:00.915
"and I don't believe that here in
this place you can ever be mine.

01:22:00.917 --> 01:22:04.158
"It's not possible because too
many people are gonna get hurt.

01:22:08.291 --> 01:22:10.324
"I have to protect
those I love.

01:22:10.326 --> 01:22:15.095
"I'm so sorry, danny.
God bless you.

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:17.998
Yours always, maggie."

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.729
What do you want?

01:22:48.731 --> 01:22:51.231
I'm askin' you to walk away.

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:56.036
I don't think so.

01:22:56.038 --> 01:23:00.207
- You made a promise.
- What was that?

01:23:00.209 --> 01:23:03.010
You said if I asked you
to leave, you'd leave.

01:23:03.012 --> 01:23:07.114
Mmm, aye. <i> Well, I'm askin'.</i>

01:23:11.721 --> 01:23:14.154
Have you been threatened?

01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:16.256
<i>Why do you say that?</i> Have you?

01:23:16.258 --> 01:23:19.159
I do have a mind
of my own, danny.

01:23:23.699 --> 01:23:28.502
I know I might very well be losin'
it, but I do have a mind of my own.

01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:31.372
Is it your father? Is it joe?

01:23:31.374 --> 01:23:34.108
No, danny.

01:23:36.479 --> 01:23:38.278
It's harry, isn't it?

01:23:41.017 --> 01:23:42.383
Is it harry?

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:47.788
Tell me. Just fuckin' tell me.

01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:50.157
Don't, danny.

01:23:53.029 --> 01:23:56.196
You don't understand.

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:59.600
Half my fuckin' life I pissed away
and all the good things in it...

01:23:59.602 --> 01:24:03.170
Because of that sickly bastard
and his dirty little,

01:24:03.172 --> 01:24:07.508
cozy little, fuckin' secret
world and all the dirt in it.

01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:11.712
And now he's tryin' to turn us into a
dirty little secret. So, fuck him!

01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:18.285
Let him know that
I love you, maggie.

01:24:18.287 --> 01:24:21.355
<i>Go out and tell him now.</i>
<i>Go and fuckin' tell him.</i>

01:24:21.357 --> 01:24:25.793
I'll not crawl around in
the fuckin' gutter for him!

01:24:25.795 --> 01:24:28.462
I'll kill him first. I'll
rip his fuckin' throat out!

01:24:28.464 --> 01:24:30.798
Don't go outside.
That's what he wants you to do.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.200
That's what he wants me to do,
and I'll fuckin' do it!

01:24:33.202 --> 01:24:35.302
Liam burnt down the gym.

01:24:41.143 --> 01:24:44.645
- He saw us together.
- What are you talkin' about?

01:24:47.783 --> 01:24:50.250
He thinks you're gonna
take me away from him.

01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:10.671
Dear god.

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:16.844
God help him.

01:25:16.846 --> 01:25:20.814
<i>When he was born, danny,</i>
<i>I held him in my arms,</i>

01:25:20.816 --> 01:25:24.318
and it made everything
all right.

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:27.287
I can't hurt him.

01:25:29.391 --> 01:25:32.426
Come here.

01:25:39.802 --> 01:25:42.803
I'm not a killer, maggie.

01:25:42.805 --> 01:25:45.439
But this place
makes me want to kill.

01:25:55.584 --> 01:26:00.654
Oh, I wish we could stay
like this for... forever.

01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:23.777
You still have it.

01:26:23.779 --> 01:26:26.713
What?

01:26:26.715 --> 01:26:30.284
My soul, for what it's worth.

01:26:49.838 --> 01:26:53.740
We can store the stuff in here
till we get the gym goin' again.

01:26:56.712 --> 01:27:00.247
I'm goin' to london, ike.
I'm takin' that fight.

01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:03.984
It's a bloody circus,

01:27:03.986 --> 01:27:07.588
and you're
their performin' monkey.

01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:10.324
We'll stay here. We'll do
things at our own pace.

01:27:10.326 --> 01:27:12.326
I'm goin', ike, and that's it.

01:27:12.328 --> 01:27:16.597
If you go, you're
goin' on your own.

01:27:16.599 --> 01:27:18.999
I'm not runnin' from anybody.

01:27:21.003 --> 01:27:23.083
You can use the flat
while I'm gone, all right?

01:27:37.987 --> 01:27:40.621
<i>Come on, danny boy. Move out</i>
<i>of the corner. That's it.</i>

01:27:40.623 --> 01:27:44.258
Come on, danny boy.
Get your feet workin'.

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:46.360
<i>Get your feet workin'. Stand
in the middle of the ring.</i>

01:27:46.362 --> 01:27:47.527
<i>Ten seconds left in round.</i>

01:27:59.642 --> 01:28:01.775
Where's ike? He's over there.

01:28:01.777 --> 01:28:03.610
Right there.

01:28:08.384 --> 01:28:10.617
Can I talk to you?

01:28:16.025 --> 01:28:18.692
It was me who burned the gym.

01:28:21.363 --> 01:28:23.830
Why?

01:28:23.832 --> 01:28:27.734
I thought danny was gonna
run away with my mother.

01:28:29.872 --> 01:28:31.738
I'm sorry.

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:40.614
Are you gonna
build the gym again?

01:28:44.753 --> 01:28:47.954
Aye, of course, I will.
Sure, I will.

01:28:47.956 --> 01:28:50.557
<i>When?</i>

01:28:53.028 --> 01:28:55.829
When danny gets back.

01:28:58.967 --> 01:29:00.801
See ya later.

01:29:09.345 --> 01:29:11.812
Champagne toast. Come on.
Let's get the bubbly out.

01:29:11.814 --> 01:29:14.815
Quick as you can, please.
Serve the top table first.

01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:23.623
Ladies and gentlemen, may I ask you all
to please stand and pray silence...

01:29:23.625 --> 01:29:25.392
<i>For your chairman</i>
<i>who will propose the toast?</i>

01:29:25.394 --> 01:29:27.361
Your chairman.

01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:30.831
The toast is the queen.

01:29:30.833 --> 01:29:32.632
The queen.

01:29:37.005 --> 01:29:40.741
One, two, three, four,

01:29:40.743 --> 01:29:43.477
<i>five, six, seven,</i>

01:29:43.479 --> 01:29:46.513
eight, nine, 10!

01:29:46.515 --> 01:29:48.815
He's out!

01:29:58.527 --> 01:30:00.861
<i>And the third bout</i>
<i>this evening,</i>

01:30:00.863 --> 01:30:03.263
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>features from nigeria...</i>

01:30:38.767 --> 01:30:40.901
Come on, danny.

01:30:44.773 --> 01:30:48.141
- Come on, the irish!
- -<i> Quiet, please.</i>

01:30:57.486 --> 01:31:01.521
Gentlemen, can I ask you to confine
your appreciation to clapping?

01:31:01.523 --> 01:31:05.826
Bang. Jab the head. Bing, bing. Keep movin'.
Stay on your toes.

01:31:29.952 --> 01:31:32.786
He's doin' well here.

01:31:40.762 --> 01:31:43.322
Danny's ahead. -<i>We're seeing
excellent movement from flynn.</i>

01:31:50.539 --> 01:31:54.541
<i>Watch your heads. Watch it.</i>

01:31:54.543 --> 01:31:56.583
Come on. Break it up.
Break! Break! Move back!

01:32:03.051 --> 01:32:06.653
He's runnin' around too much.
He can't keep that up.

01:32:15.564 --> 01:32:19.032
Get off the ropes, danny! Off the ropes!
Jesus christ.

01:32:35.017 --> 01:32:37.684
Come on, akim!
Come on! Come on!

01:32:37.686 --> 01:32:39.553
Whoa!

01:32:39.555 --> 01:32:43.023
You're okay.

01:32:43.025 --> 01:32:46.593
Phil, get the cart. Danny, you're cut.
And you're runnin' out of time.

01:32:53.802 --> 01:32:58.104
This is it. Here comes
the clash of heads.

01:32:58.106 --> 01:33:00.173
The irishman's
too far behind on points.

01:33:00.175 --> 01:33:02.215
<i>He's got to knock him out</i>
<i>to win this fight.</i>

01:33:20.796 --> 01:33:25.298
<i>One, two, three, four, five,</i>

01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:29.803
six, seven, eight...

01:33:29.805 --> 01:33:32.806
you're okay. You're okay.
Get your hands up.

01:33:32.808 --> 01:33:35.308
<i>Box!</i>

01:33:40.315 --> 01:33:42.148
<i>Break!</i>

01:33:52.227 --> 01:33:56.863
One! Two! Three! Four!

01:33:56.865 --> 01:34:02.636
Five! Six! Seven! Eight!

01:34:02.638 --> 01:34:06.706
Get your hands up. Box!

01:34:06.708 --> 01:34:08.869
<i>Come on, flynn. Box on!</i>

01:34:15.083 --> 01:34:16.816
Come on, flynn! Box!

01:35:02.998 --> 01:35:04.731
Box on!

01:35:07.736 --> 01:35:10.170
<i>Box on.</i> It's over.

01:35:12.908 --> 01:35:14.908
- Box on.
- The fight's over.

01:35:17.012 --> 01:35:19.879
I told you he was a quitter,
didn't I, betty?

01:35:19.881 --> 01:35:22.721
You should stop the fuckin' fight.
Flynn!

01:35:28.156 --> 01:35:30.090
<i>What an extraordinary ending.</i>

01:35:32.394 --> 01:35:34.714
<i>You'll never fight</i>
<i>in this country again.</i>

01:35:46.274 --> 01:35:49.976
<i>Hey!</i> Are you happy now?

01:35:49.978 --> 01:35:54.848
¶Oh, Danny Boy, The Pipes
The pipes are callin' ¶

01:35:54.850 --> 01:35:58.485
That's some boxer
you got there, ike.

01:35:58.487 --> 01:36:01.087
Throws in his own towel.
You teach him that?

01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:04.290
Aye, you laugh at danny flynn,

01:36:04.292 --> 01:36:07.961
the only good thing that ever
came out of this district.

01:36:07.963 --> 01:36:12.198
I know you, harry! You're only
interested in hurtin' people.

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:15.335
<i>That's your only pleasure,</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>

01:36:15.337 --> 01:36:17.837
Go and get yourself
another bottle of meths, ike.

01:36:17.839 --> 01:36:20.774
Take it easy, harry.

01:36:23.311 --> 01:36:27.380
You tell all the big boys
in there how you ran away,

01:36:27.382 --> 01:36:31.050
<i>how you left danny flynn</i>
<i>to take the blame,</i>

01:36:31.052 --> 01:36:35.054
how he kept his mouth shut,

01:36:35.056 --> 01:36:39.859
how he should've told and a lot more
innocent people would be alive today!

01:36:39.861 --> 01:36:43.329
Shut your fuckin' mouth, ya drunken
wino, or I'll shut it for ya.

01:36:43.331 --> 01:36:45.431
You killed
this district, harry!

01:36:45.433 --> 01:36:49.035
<i>You killed</i>
<i>the one thing you loved.</i>

01:36:49.037 --> 01:36:52.372
Come on, harry. He's irrelevant.
Leave me alone.

01:36:52.374 --> 01:36:56.209
- Your own son!
- What are you talkin' about?

01:36:56.211 --> 01:36:58.478
You filled his head
full of shit!

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.280
And you sent him out to die!

01:37:02.484 --> 01:37:06.052
Go home. Go home!

01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:26.973
He's dead. He's dead, liam.

01:37:29.177 --> 01:37:31.444
Sorry, liam.

01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:36.549
<i>The army says</i>
<i>he could be booby-trapped.</i>

01:37:36.551 --> 01:37:39.285
<i>Come back, liam!</i>
<i>He could be booby-trapped!</i>

01:37:39.287 --> 01:37:42.021
<i>He's booby-trapped!</i>
<i>Liam! Come back!</i>

01:37:42.023 --> 01:37:45.859
<i>Stay away from the body!</i>
<i>You have been warned!</i>

01:37:45.861 --> 01:37:50.029
<i>Stay back from the body!</i>
<i>Stay away! Stay away!</i>

01:37:50.031 --> 01:37:53.099
<i>You have been warned!</i>

01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:57.230
Danny.

01:38:58.433 --> 01:39:01.200
They're watching the house.

01:39:01.202 --> 01:39:04.270
Fuck 'em. Can I come in?

01:39:11.146 --> 01:39:15.515
My father's here. Good. I'd like
to have a word with him too.

01:39:15.517 --> 01:39:17.637
Peter. Danny.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.067
Danny.

01:39:34.069 --> 01:39:36.970
<i>I'm sorry about ike weir.</i>

01:39:40.475 --> 01:39:43.676
I'm gonna build a gym for the kids.
Try and teach them somethin'.

01:39:46.247 --> 01:39:48.982
You taught me to stand my ground,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

01:39:48.984 --> 01:39:51.150
Are you back
for revenge, danny?

01:39:51.152 --> 01:39:55.288
No. No, I'm back for maggie.

01:39:55.290 --> 01:39:57.423
<i>Will she be safe with ya?</i>

01:39:57.425 --> 01:40:00.994
She'll never be safer.

01:40:00.996 --> 01:40:05.198
I don't know if we can have a life
together, maggie. It's up to you.

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:09.268
<i>You've more things at
stake than I have.</i> Okay.

01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:12.705
I'll not put her life
in danger.

01:40:12.707 --> 01:40:14.741
We'll talk about that.
We'll work things out.

01:40:14.743 --> 01:40:17.783
Nor am I gonna sneak around as
if we've done wrong. We haven't.

01:40:20.482 --> 01:40:25.385
- And I'm not leavin'.
- It's a dangerous game you're playin'.

01:40:25.387 --> 01:40:29.756
It's a dangerous game, all right, joe.
You know all about that.

01:40:29.758 --> 01:40:34.594
It's... it's my home, you know?

01:40:34.596 --> 01:40:37.196
No one's gonna drive me
outta my home.

01:40:37.198 --> 01:40:40.433
Eternal rest grant on him, my lord, and
may perpetual light shine upon him.

01:40:40.435 --> 01:40:43.369
May he rest in peace.

01:40:43.371 --> 01:40:46.506
May his soul and the souls of all the
faithful departed, through the mercy of god,

01:40:46.508 --> 01:40:48.574
<i>rest in peace.</i> Amen.

01:41:13.101 --> 01:41:15.835
Let's go for a walk. Yep.

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:22.708
Can I help ya rebuild the gym?
Is that okay?

01:41:22.710 --> 01:41:25.611
Aye.

01:41:27.248 --> 01:41:30.483
Why draw trouble to yourselves?

01:41:30.485 --> 01:41:34.353
Because it's mad to run away as
if we'd committed some crime.

01:41:41.429 --> 01:41:44.509
Don't forget. It's no problem.
It's all right.

01:41:46.701 --> 01:41:48.668
Mr. Hamill.

01:41:58.146 --> 01:41:59.645
<i>We're bein' followed.</i>

01:42:18.733 --> 01:42:22.535
I'm not gonna let you drive around with
a prisoner's wife. Get out of the car.

01:42:22.537 --> 01:42:28.207
Get outta the car. Did you forget your
weddin' ring, ya fuckin' whore ya?

01:42:28.209 --> 01:42:30.510
You're a prisoner's wife. You

<i>Fuckin' whore. You'd fuck

01:42:43.925 --> 01:42:46.259
Give me the fuckin' thing!

01:42:46.261 --> 01:42:48.628
- Kill him!
- Stop it, you bastards!

01:42:48.630 --> 01:42:50.796
<i>Stop it!</i>

Fuckin' whore! You know what we

01:43:00.708 --> 01:43:05.178
<i>Harry! Harry!</i>
<i>Let's do it clean.</i>

01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:07.280
<i>Let him go, bastards!</i>

01:43:07.282 --> 01:43:11.284
- take him away.
- Move it! - Danny! No!

01:43:11.286 --> 01:43:14.587
<i>Danny! Danny! Danny!</i>

01:43:17.825 --> 01:43:21.627
<i>What'd you think was gonna happen?
You can't just walk outta here!</i>

01:43:21.629 --> 01:43:24.297
Jesus! For 25 years we've
been living with this shit!

01:43:24.299 --> 01:43:29.535
Liam! <i> Jesus christ!
He's fuckin' dead!</i>

01:43:29.537 --> 01:43:32.305
He's fuckin' dead!

01:43:38.613 --> 01:43:40.253
Let her go. That's from joe.

01:43:42.884 --> 01:43:44.984
Danny!

01:43:47.555 --> 01:43:49.822
<i>Danny!</i>

01:44:18.386 --> 01:44:20.253
Move away.

01:44:26.661 --> 01:44:29.729
End of story, peacemaker.

01:44:32.767 --> 01:44:34.934
Stand back.

01:44:39.474 --> 01:44:41.340
Move it.

01:44:47.615 --> 01:44:49.548
Get away from here, danny.

01:45:26.587 --> 01:45:28.554
Danny!

01:45:34.996 --> 01:45:37.430
Danny!

01:45:37.432 --> 01:45:39.899
You all right?

01:46:55.676 --> 01:46:58.144
Where are you goin'?

01:46:58.146 --> 01:47:00.780
We're going home.

01:48:34.909 --> 01:48:37.510
<i>¶Cover My Eyes Lead me away ¶</i>
