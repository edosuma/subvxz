00:01.210 --> 00:04.210
&lt;♪&gt;

00:11.630 --> 00:12.590
[BIG FAT RONNIE] WHERE'S
MY MONEY?

00:12.630 --> 00:14.220
WHERE'S MY MONEY?
WHERE'S MY MONEY?

00:14.260 --> 00:16.350
[JAKE] COME ON, RONNIE,
I'M GOING TO PAY YOU BACK!

00:16.390 --> 00:18.390
I JUST NEED A COUPLE OF DAYS.

00:21.640 --> 00:23.230
I GET IT.

00:23.270 --> 00:26.650
YOU HAVE A PRESSING NEED
FOR IT NOW. NO PROBLEM.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.360
[BIG FAT RONNIE] FOUR GRAND,
DOYLE. NOW THAT'S TWO MONTHS
AGO.

00:38.450 --> 00:40.040
[JAKE] I NEED THIS FOR A SECOND.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.080
LAST CALL WAS AGES AGO, ANYWAY.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.460
I CAN'T... PAY YOU...

00:45.500 --> 00:47.250
IF I'M DEAD!

00:47.290 --> 00:50.050
[BIG FAT RONNIE] AT THIS POINT
IT'S NOT EVEN THE MONEY I'M
LOOKING FOR.

00:55.220 --> 00:58.100
[JAKE] I WAS GONNA PAY
YOU BACK, RONNIE.

00:58.140 --> 01:01.640
I ALWAYS...
PAY YOU BACK, RONNIE.

01:01.680 --> 01:04.060
BUT THIS WAS TOTALLY EXCESSIVE.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.270
[JAKE] YEAH--
I KNOW I'M LATE, OKAY.

01:08.310 --> 01:11.070
JUST KEEP YOUR GIRDLE ON.

01:28.460 --> 01:31.710
[MAL] YOU'RE LATE.
AND YOU LOOK LIKE CRAP.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.170
[JAKE] YEAH, WELL, I'M HERE,
AREN'T I?

01:33.210 --> 01:34.760
[MAL] THE CLIENT WILL BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.340
[JAKE] WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE,
ANYWAY?

01:37.390 --> 01:40.100
[MAL] THE MAN INSISTED WE MEET
UP HERE.

01:40.140 --> 01:42.100
YOU SMELL LIKE BOOZE-- ARE YOU
DRUNK?

01:42.140 --> 01:48.350
[JAKE] NO I'M NOT. I DROVE UP
HERE. I'M NOT DRINKING. I HAD TO
SMASH A PINT ON A GUYS HEAD

01:48.400 --> 01:49.850
IT'S A LONG STORY.

01:49.900 --> 01:52.980
[MAL] SEE? EVER SINCE YOU
STARTED THIS "LOVE MORATORIUM"

01:53.030 --> 01:54.780
YOU'VE BEEN TOTALLY
OUT OF WHACK.

01:54.820 --> 01:56.650
[JAKE] LOVE MORATORIUM?
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

01:56.700 --> 01:59.320
I'M TAKING A BREAK FROM
WOMEN FOR AWHILE, THAT'S ALL.

01:59.370 --> 02:01.580
AND STOP TALKING ABOUT
MY SEX LIFE. YOU'RE GOING TO
MAKE ME PUKE.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.830
[MAL] FINE. WE CAN WAIT IN
SILENCE. THEN--

02:03.870 --> 02:05.290
[JAKE] GOOD.

02:05.330 --> 02:08.920
[MAL] IS IT A CHOICE, OR IS IT
THAT WOMEN NOW WANT NOTHING TO

02:08.960 --> 02:11.290
DO WITH YOU? POST-DIVORCE,
DAMAGED GOODS AND ALL?

02:11.340 --> 02:12.670
[JAKE] YOU'RE A WONDERFUL
FATHER.

02:12.710 --> 02:14.420
YOU SHOULD WRITE A BOOK OR
SOMETHING.

02:14.460 --> 02:16.970
[MAL] LOOK SHARP.

02:17.010 --> 02:18.590
[NATHAN] WERE YOU FOLLOWED?

02:18.640 --> 02:20.510
[JAKE] DOES HE COUNT?

02:20.550 --> 02:22.180
[NATHAN] I'M NATHAN.
THIS IS MY WIFE, REBECCA.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING.

02:22.220 --> 02:24.720
[REBECCA] PLEASE, WE DESPERATELY
NEED YOUR HELP.

02:24.770 --> 02:25.770
[MAL] AND WHY'S THAT?

02:25.810 --> 02:27.230
[NATHAN] I AM IN GRAVE DANGER.

02:27.270 --> 02:28.520
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO KILL ME.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.690
[MAL] OH. HAVE YOU CONTACTED THE
POLICE--

02:30.730 --> 02:34.070
[NATHAN] NO POLICE-- MO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS, YOU CANNOT SPEAK
TO

02:34.110 --> 02:37.400
THE POLICE. IT'S A MATTER OF
NATIONAL SECURITY--

02:37.450 --> 02:38.450
[JAKE] NATIONAL SECURITY?

02:38.490 --> 02:41.070
&lt;SCREECHING&gt;

02:41.120 --> 02:43.080
[REBECCA] OH GOD--
THEY'VE FOUND US!

02:43.120 --> 02:44.490
[ROBERT] NOBODY MOVE!

02:46.580 --> 02:48.370
YOU, IN THE VAN!

02:48.410 --> 02:50.040
[REBECCA] NO!

02:55.800 --> 02:57.170
[ROBERT] BACK OFF!

03:01.140 --> 03:03.140
[JAKE] DO I KNOW YOU?

03:04.640 --> 03:06.640
[JAKE] I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.360
DAD? ARE YOU OKAY?!

03:12.400 --> 03:14.610
[MAL] I'M FINE. MY LEG CRAMPED.

03:14.650 --> 03:17.650
[REBECCA] MY HUSBAND--
THEY'VE TAKEN HIM.

03:20.240 --> 03:23.240
&lt;♪&gt;

03:44.930 --> 03:49.680
[JAKE] UM, JUST MAKE YOURSELF AT
HOME

03:49.730 --> 03:52.730
I'LL GET YOU
A PLACE TO SIT HERE.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.860
[REBECCA] THANK YOU.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.610
[MAL] ARE YOU LIVING HERE?

04:02.660 --> 04:05.450
I THREW YOU OUT OF
THE HOUSE THINKING
YOU'D FIND AN APARTMENT,

04:05.490 --> 04:06.410
NOT MOVE INTO OUR NEW OFFICE.

04:06.450 --> 04:11.620
[JAKE] IT'S TEMPORARY.
JUST RELAX-- SO,

04:11.660 --> 04:13.540
ANY IDEA WHO MIGHT HAVE
KIDNAPPED YOUR HUSBAND?

04:13.580 --> 04:16.460
[REBECCA] I HAVE NO IDEA.
REALLY--

04:16.500 --> 04:19.260
[JAKE] DO YOU KNOW OF ANYONE WHO
MAY HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST HIM?

04:19.300 --> 04:21.260
YOU KNOW, GRUDGES, MONEY
PROBLEMS, THAT KIND OF THING?

04:21.300 --> 04:23.470
[REBECCA] WELL, THERE IS HIS
FRIEND ROBERT.

04:23.510 --> 04:26.640
THEY'RE LIKE BROTHERS--
INSEPARABLE.

04:26.680 --> 04:30.220
BUT LATELY THINGS HAVE BEEN
DIFFERENT BETWEEN THEM.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.310
[MAL] THEY'RE MAILMEN?

04:31.350 --> 04:34.350
[JAKE] MAILMEN. RIGHT. THAT
MAKES SENSE.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.480
[MAL] OKAY-- SO

04:36.520 --> 04:38.980
WHY WERE YOU AND YOUR
MAILMAN HUSBAND DRESSED

04:39.030 --> 04:40.650
FOR A NIGHT AT THE OPERA
AT FIVE IN THE MORNING?

04:40.690 --> 04:41.740
[REBECCA] I DON'T KNOW.

04:41.780 --> 04:43.530
I JUST DID WHAT NATHAN
ASKED ME TO.

04:43.570 --> 04:45.410
[JAKE] HE SAID THIS WAS A
MATTER OF "NATIONAL SECURITY?"

04:45.450 --> 04:46.570
WHAT WAS HE TALKING ABOUT?

04:46.620 --> 04:50.870
[REBECCA] I HAVE NO IDEA.
REALLY. NATHAN--

04:50.910 --> 04:53.790
YOU HAVE TO HELP HIM.
BUT HE SAID NO POLICE.

04:53.830 --> 04:57.290
[MAL] DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.

04:57.340 --> 05:00.130
KIDNAPPING? THERE'LL BE A RANSOM
DEMAND SOON.

05:00.170 --> 05:02.880
I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD
CALL THE COPS IN ON THIS.

05:02.920 --> 05:06.680
[JAKE] CUSTOMER'S ALWAYS RIGHT,
REMEMBER? LET'S PLAY IT BY EAR.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.760
[MAL] OKAY. THE CLOCK IS
TICKING, WE BETTER GET MOVING.

05:08.810 --> 05:12.020
[JAKE] YEAH. I GOT A... I GOT A

[JAKE] AND I'M NOT BUYING THIS
WHOLE LEG CRAMP CRAP, OK?

05:18.980 --> 05:21.480
YOU WERE WINDED BACK

WRONG WITH YOUR TICKER?

05:21.530 --> 05:24.900
[MAL] I'M FINE.
GET TO WORK. TIDY UP.

05:26.610 --> 05:28.620

[ROSE] I SEE.
[DES] HE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT I CAN DO.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.460

PROGRESS, WHEN THEY
CONVERT YET ANOTHER HISTORICAL
MONUMENT. AND YES IF --

07:41.290 --> 07:43.580
[JAKE] TO SAY YOU CLEAN UP NICE

07:43.630 --> 07:45.170
[LESLIE] JAKE, YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

07:45.210 --> 07:46.710

IF NOT, THEN HE'S NOT OUR GUY.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.250

DO YOU THINK HE'LL RECOGNIZE?

09:07.290 --> 09:09.300

RECOGNIZED ME, BUT THERE WAS
DEFINITELY SOMETHING THERE. PLUS

10:20.570 --> 10:23.870

FERN.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.180

BESIDES IT CAN'T

11:23.890 --> 11:27.140
BE THAT HARD. WHERE ARE YOUR
PARENTS, ANYWAY?

11:27.180 --> 11:30.480
[CHANTEL] MONTREAL. THEY DUMPED
ME WITH MY UNCLE IN FOXTRAP

11:30.520 --> 11:32.480
SO DAD'S HOUSE IS TOTALLY
DESERTED.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.860
[TINNY] WEIRD. MY MOM
TOTALLY DITCHED ME FOR WORK,
TOO.

11:35.900 --> 11:40.240
[DES] THE GIRLS ARE BONDING OVER
MUTUAL FEELINGS OF ABANDONMENT.

11:40.280 --> 11:43.280
THIS INVESTIGATOR'S
HEART STRINGS ARE
DEFINITELY BEING PULLED.

11:44.530 --> 11:46.540
MORE ON THAT LATER. NATURE
CALLS.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.920
[MAL] WHAT'S UP, DOC?

11:55.960 --> 12:03.510
[NIKKI] MAL, HI. WOW! OH MY
GOSH, IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:03.550 --> 12:06.140
I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN AND
SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOING. HOW
ARE YOU?

12:06.180 --> 12:07.010
[NIKKI] GOOD, I'M GREAT.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.560
HERE, SIT SIT.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.890
I'M GREAT, ACTUALLY.

12:10.940 --> 12:12.140
[MAL] I HEARD.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.940
[NIKKI] YEAH, OKAY. WHEN
I THREATENED TO LEAVE

12:13.980 --> 12:19.070
THEY THREW THIS HUGE INCENTIVE
PACKAGE AT ME. AND UH, AND THEN
THERE'S THIS.

12:19.110 --> 12:23.160
[MAL] AH. CONGRATULATIONS. JAKE
TOLD ME. THAT'S FANTASTIC.

12:23.200 --> 12:27.870
[NIKKI] YEAH, DAVID, MY DIVORCE
LAWYER. JAKE LOVES THAT. HE
ALWAYS MAKES FUN OF ME.

12:27.910 --> 12:33.500
[MAL] WELL, WE'RE HAPPY FOR YOU.
ALL OF US. JAKE, TOO.

12:33.540 --> 12:38.000
[NIKKI] THANKS. SO... HOW 'BOUT
YOU?

12:38.050 --> 12:39.760
HOW'RE YOU FEELING POST OP?

12:39.800 --> 12:42.010
[MAL] I'M FINE-- I'M GOOD.

12:42.050 --> 12:45.850
[NIKKI] THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT
YOU WANTED TO ASK?

12:45.890 --> 12:48.810
[MAL] WELL, THERE WAS ONE THING.

12:48.850 --> 12:50.100
[NIKKI] OKAY.

12:50.140 --> 12:55.860
[MAL] I'VE BEEN-- IT'S
NOTHING, REALLY.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.770
[NIKKI] LET ME BE JUDGE OF THAT.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.730
CAUSE HEART PROBLEMS, THEY CAN
TAKE A LOT OF TIME TO SORT OUT.

13:00.780 --> 13:05.990
[MAL] YEAH. WELL,
I DON'T FEEL--

13:06.030 --> 13:10.790
I HAVE BEEN FEELING-- NOT RIGHT.

13:14.120 --> 13:17.500
OH, IT'S JAKE. I'M SUPPOSED TO
MEET HIM. CASE WE'RE WORKING ON.

13:17.540 --> 13:19.380
I BETTER GET GOING. SORRY.
RAINCHECK?

13:19.420 --> 13:21.210
[NIKKI] YES, BUT--
[MAL] ROSE WAS SAYING HOW MUCH

13:21.260 --> 13:22.710
SHE'D LIKE TO SEE YOU.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.550
[NIKKI] I'D LOVE TO SEE HER,
TOO. BUT, MAL-- IF SOMETHING

13:24.590 --> 13:26.970
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT--
[MAL] I'M GOOD AS GOLD.

13:27.010 --> 13:31.850
BEST KIND. NO WORRIES. GREAT TO
SEE YOU.

13:31.890 --> 13:33.890
[NIKKI] GOOD TO SEE YOU.

13:38.940 --> 13:41.110
[REBECCA] THANKS FOR COMING
OVER-- I MEAN YOU

13:41.150 --> 13:43.030
REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO, I'M FINE.

13:43.070 --> 13:45.950
[JAKE] I WATCHED YOUR HUSBAND
GET KIDNAPPED THIS MORNING, MRS.
JONES.

13:45.990 --> 13:49.620
I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
FOR YOU TO BE ALONE RIGHT NOW.

13:49.660 --> 13:54.000
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT
ROBERT AND NATHAN? THEY WERE
GOOD BUDDIES, EH?

13:54.040 --> 13:56.000
[REBECCA] THEY WENT TO
HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER. LONG

13:56.040 --> 14:02.630
BEFORE NATHAN AND ME. SKYDIVING,
SNOWBOARDING, MOTORCYCLES--

14:02.670 --> 14:04.050
HUGE ADRENALINE JUNKIES.

14:04.090 --> 14:05.340
WHY DON'T YOU STAY FOR A DRINK?

14:05.380 --> 14:10.010
I MEAN, YOU MUST BE TIRED AFTER
ALL THIS EXCITEMENT?

14:10.050 --> 14:12.060
[JAKE] WELL, IT'S A LITTLE
EARLY. PLUS I THOUGHT MAYBE I
SHOULD

14:12.100 --> 14:14.480
KEEP SEARCHING FOR YOUR
KIDNAPPED HUSBAND.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.610
THAT SUV-- DO YOU RECOGNIZE IT?

14:20.650 --> 14:23.230
[REBECCA] UH, NO, I DON'T THINK
SO. WHY?

14:26.530 --> 14:27.530
[JAKE] HEY.

14:27.990 --> 14:29.570
[HEATHER] DON'T MOVE!

14:29.620 --> 14:31.120
[REBECCA] WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE!?

14:31.160 --> 14:32.950
[JAKE] YOU RECOGNIZE HER, TOO?
DON'T YOU?

14:32.990 --> 14:34.950
[REBECCA] NO. OF COURSE NOT!

14:35.000 --> 14:36.460
[HEATHER] I SAID DON'T MOVE!

14:36.500 --> 14:38.250
[JAKE] YEAH, SEE? IT'S EVEN IN
YOUR VOICE.

14:38.290 --> 14:42.000
I KNOW I KNOW YOU FROM
SOMEWHERE. I MEAN, BESIDES THE
KIDNAPPING THING, EARLIER.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.750
OR PERHAPS I'M MISTAKEN.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.800
[HEATHER] WHERE'S YOUR
HUSBAND'S LAPTOP?

14:56.520 --> 15:01.520
[REBECCA] GO GET HER,
GET HER, GET HER!

15:03.190 --> 15:13.200
&lt;♪&gt;

15:23.170 --> 15:24.920
[JAKE] WHAT THE HELL, MAN?

15:36.010 --> 15:40.520
OKAY, REBECCA. WHO WAS
THE MOTORCYCLE GIRL, HUH?

15:40.560 --> 15:43.940
I KNOW YOU KNEW HER? START
TELLING ME THE TRUTH

15:43.980 --> 15:45.190
OR I CALL THE COPS RIGHT NOW.

15:45.230 --> 15:47.440
[REBECCA] NO, PLEASE. NO POLICE.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.740
[JAKE] I'M DIALING 9... 1...
[REBECCA] WAIT! OKAY, FINE.

15:50.780 --> 15:53.030
ALRIGHT UM...

15:53.070 --> 15:57.160
MY HUSBAND ISN'T JUST
A MAILMAN. HE WORKS FOR CSIS.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.160
MY HUSBAND'S A SPY.

15:59.200 --> 16:03.170
&lt;♪&gt;

16:03.210 --> 16:05.090
[JAKE] SO,
YOUR HUSBAND'S A SPY.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.010
[REBECCA] CSIS USES POSTMEN
TO FILTER MAIL.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.010
NATHAN MUST HAVE
INTERCEPTED SOMETHING AND NOW

16:10.050 --> 16:10.920
ROBERT WANTS TO GET IT.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.180
[MAL] SO ROBERT'S A SPY, TOO?

16:13.220 --> 16:16.180
[REBECCA] I DON'T KNOW. I
MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE THEY CAN TALK
ABOUT THESE KINDS OF THINGS.

16:16.220 --> 16:18.140
[JAKE] AND THE GUY IN THE SUV
WHO ALMOST KILLED ME AND THE

16:18.180 --> 16:22.140
GIRL WHO BROKE INTO
YOUR HOUSE, STOLE THE LAPTOP,
ARE THEY SPIES AS WELL?

16:22.190 --> 16:23.150
[REBECCA] I HAVE NO IDEA.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.190
MY HUSBAND'S WORK IS
EXTREMELY SECRETIVE.

16:25.230 --> 16:27.780
HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO
TELL ME ANYTHING.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.820
[JAKE] MAKES SENSE.
CAN YOU GIVE US A SECOND?

16:35.950 --> 16:39.790
SO, UH, DO WE CALL THE GUYS IN
THE WHITE COATS AND THE LITTLE
WHITE

16:39.830 --> 16:42.160
[MAL] YEAH SOMETHING'S UP WITH
HER BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT.

16:42.210 --> 16:45.250
[JAKE] HER HUSBAND'S
DEFINITELY NOT A SPY. HE DIDN'T
EVEN LOOK GOOD IN A TUX.

16:45.290 --> 16:46.790
[ROSE] HEY THERE.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.590
[MAL] HI
[JAKE] HEY SO WHAT DID YOU
FIND ABOUT ROBERT'S MATCHBOOK?

16:50.630 --> 16:54.590
ANY 'MICROFILM?'
[ROSE] AH, NO, I'M GOING
THROUGH SOME OLD YELLOW PAGES.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.390
[MAL] AND WHAT DID YOU DIG UP
ABOUT OUR SPY NATHAN JONES?

16:57.430 --> 17:00.600
[ROSE] NOTHING. ZILCH.
HE'S GOT NO DEBTS, NO RECORD,
NOTHING.

17:00.640 --> 17:05.230
NOT EVEN A PARKING TICKET.
[JAKE] UH...GET OUT.
[ROSE] OH...

17:05.270 --> 17:07.650
PRIVACY, PLEASE.

17:07.690 --> 17:09.110
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

17:09.150 --> 17:11.240
[LESLIE] I RAN YOUR PLATE.
DO YOU WANT THE INFO OR NOT?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.690
[JAKE] YEAH. OF COURSE. AND
THANK YOU.

17:12.740 --> 17:16.240
SEE, WE CAN HAVE A HEALTHY
WORKING RELATIONSHIP AND
STILL.. YOU KNOW.

17:16.280 --> 17:19.620
NO, WE CAN'T. I DID IT SO
YOU WOULDN'T FOLLOW ME
AROUND ALL DAY.

17:19.660 --> 17:22.660
THE VAN IS A RENTAL UNDER THE
NAME REBECCA JONES.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.080
[JAKE] REALLY? THANK YOU.

17:26.120 --> 17:29.250
I'LL FIND, UH, EIGHT OR
NINE WAYS TO PAY YOU BACK FOR
THIS.

17:29.290 --> 17:31.170
FORTY-SEVEN IF YOU'RE STILL
WEARING THAT DRESS.

17:31.210 --> 17:32.420
[LESLIE] JAKE, WE HAVE TO TALK.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.220
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANNA TELL YA.

17:34.260 --> 17:37.260
[JAKE] OK, WE CAN TALK NOW?
NOW, NOW? YOU WANNA TALK
NOW?

17:37.300 --> 17:39.220
[LESLIE] YEA.. NO. I'LL, UH,
I'LL CALL YA.

17:39.260 --> 17:40.930
[JAKE] OKAY.

17:40.970 --> 17:46.150
YEAH, UM, DAD? ROSE? CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SEC? JUST A SEC.

17:49.310 --> 17:53.070
SO, THE VAN RENTAL, GUESS
WHOSE NAME IT WAS RENTED UNDER?

18:02.330 --> 18:04.080
ALRIGHT, I'LL GO AFTER HER.
YOU STAY HERE.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.120
[MAL] NO, I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.290
[MAYOR CLARKE] THANK YOU FOR
TODAY. I'M SURE YOU BOTH HAD
BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN

18:08.330 --> 18:10.210
BABYSITTING ME.
[LESLIE] IT'S OUR PLEASURE, SIR.

18:10.250 --> 18:14.880
[HOOD] I JUST WANTED TO SAY THE
WHOLE "WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE
FUTURE OF THE CITY" THING...

18:14.920 --> 18:17.130
IT'S GREAT. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF
FANS, INCLUDING ME.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.050
[MAYOR CLARKE] OH, OH, THANK
YOU.

18:18.090 --> 18:19.680
[HOOD] NO. THANK YOU, CITY
PLANNER.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.470
[MAYOR CLARKE] I'M SURE I'M
KEEPING YOU FROM YOUR DUTY.

18:21.510 --> 18:24.310
NICE SEEING YOU,
SERGEANT HOOD AND...

18:24.350 --> 18:25.680
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T
CATCH YOUR NAME.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.480
[LESLIE] UH, BENNETT.
SERGEANT BENNETT.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.520
[MAYOR CLARKE] SERGEANT BENNETT.
ALL RIGHT.

18:32.940 --> 18:35.320
[HOOD] YOU COULD'VE BEEN
A LITTLE NICER TO HIS WORSHIP.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.110
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.660
[MAL] SHE RENTED THE VAN THAT
KIDNAPPED HER HUSBAND? SHE

18:40.700 --> 18:42.700
MUST'VE KNOWN WE'D FIND THAT
OUT?

18:42.740 --> 18:44.200
[JAKE] MAYBE SHE JUST
THINKS WE'RE TERRIBLE

18:44.240 --> 18:47.290
INVESTIGATORS. THAT SUV, AGAIN.

18:47.330 --> 18:50.710
UM... I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.010
[JAKE] HELLO, INTERNATIONAL
SPIES?

19:01.970 --> 19:06.890
BIG FAT RONNIE. MILT. SORRY
ABOUT THE EAR THERE, BUDDY. I
DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME.

19:06.930 --> 19:10.310
[BIG FAT RONNIE] JAKE
DOYLE, P.I. LOOKING DANDY.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.810
[JAKE] YEAH I WAS ACTUALLY
HOPING I WOULD RUN INTO YOU
TODAY.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.320
[BIG FAT RONNIE] REALLY? SO
THAT'S WHY YOU NEARLY KILLED ME
IN A

19:15.360 --> 19:16.530
HEAD-ON COLLISION?

19:16.570 --> 19:19.110
[JAKE] THAT WAS A CASE OF
MISTAKEN IDENTITY.

19:19.150 --> 19:22.450
[BIG FAT RONNIE] I LEND
PEOPLE MONEY, AND THEN THEY PAY
ME BACK.

19:22.490 --> 19:24.030
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
[JAKE] TRUE...

19:24.080 --> 19:26.250
[BIG FAT RONNIE] THEN I HEAR YOU
TOOK THE FOUR GRAND I LENT YOU,

19:26.290 --> 19:28.210
AND TRIPLED IT AT
THE GOULDS TRACK.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.000
[JAKE] ALSO TRUE.
[BIG FAT RONNIE] YOU TRIPLE
THE MONEY--

19:30.040 --> 19:33.380
BUT YOU CAN'T PAY ME MY MONEY.
WELL THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

19:33.420 --> 19:39.880
WHAT'S YOU OWE ME IS INTEREST.
JAKE, YOU OWE ME A LOT,

19:39.930 --> 19:42.430
WHAT'S YOUR CAR WORTH?
FOUR GRAND?

19:42.470 --> 19:45.350
PLUS TWO MONTHS INTEREST MAYBE?

19:45.390 --> 19:47.020
GIMME THE KEYS.

19:48.730 --> 19:49.730
[JAKE] TO MY CAR.

19:49.770 --> 19:52.190
[BIG FAT RONNIE] NO, NO.
THAT'S MY CAR.

19:52.230 --> 19:53.770
I MEAN, MILT'S ALREADY
GOING TO POUND YOU.

19:53.810 --> 19:55.820
[JAKE] ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

20:06.490 --> 20:08.410
OPEN THE DOOR!

20:24.430 --> 20:27.720
[DES] A LITTLE GIFT FOR YOU.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.430
IT'S JUST-- JAKE IS PAYING ME
NOW AND I THOUGHT,

20:30.480 --> 20:32.440
BECAUSE YOU WERE LOOKING AT IT,
YOU MIGHT WANT IT--

20:32.480 --> 20:34.060
BUT YOU MAYBE DIDN'T HAVE
THE MONEY FOR IT.

20:34.100 --> 20:39.190
AND I HAVE A LITTLE--
SO I BOUGHT YOU-- THE FERN.

20:39.230 --> 20:40.530
[TINNY] A FERN.

20:40.570 --> 20:43.610
[DES] YOU WERE LOOKING AT IT.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.120
[TINNY] ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

20:45.160 --> 20:48.040
[DES] WHAT? NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I
WAS...

20:48.080 --> 20:53.330
I WAS DOWNTOWN. AND I JUST SAW
YOU, AND I SAW THE SHOP
AND THE FLOWERS, AND I SAW YOU

20:53.370 --> 20:57.670
IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT
CREEPY. LIKE THAT. IT'S NOT.

20:57.710 --> 21:04.300
TRUST ME. IT'S SWEET.

21:04.340 --> 21:08.680
[TINNY] THAT'S A FINE LINE,
DESSY.

21:08.720 --> 21:12.430
[DES] WHERE ARE YOU GOING? YOU
FORGOT...

21:12.480 --> 21:14.350
[JAKE] THIS LOOK LIKE A SPY'S
HOUSE TO YOU?

21:14.390 --> 21:15.390
[MAL] I DON'T KNOW.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.520
HOW MUCH DO YOU OWE
BIG FAT RONNIE?

21:16.560 --> 21:18.440
[JAKE] MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.610
[MAL] I WAS WONDERING WHERE YOU
GOT THE CASH TO FIX THE GTO.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.070
SHE RIDES NICE, BY THE WAY.

21:22.110 --> 21:24.400
[JAKE] YEAH, YOU HIT EVERY
POTHOLE ON THE WAY OVER HERE.

21:24.450 --> 21:27.320
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING HERE
THAT'LL STRAIGHTEN THIS ALL OUT.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.870
[MAL] LEARNING TO LOVE LENTILS.

21:28.910 --> 21:36.540
TERRIFIC TOFU. VEGETARIAN SPIES,
HUH? THIS LOOKS LIKE MY
FUTURE DIET.

21:36.580 --> 21:40.420
[JAKE] IT'LL BE A NICE CHANGE
FROM CHICKEN WINGS STUFFED
WITH HAM.

21:40.460 --> 21:44.470
[MAL] AH, LOOK, I FOUND A
TICKLE TRUNK.

21:44.510 --> 21:48.140
[JAKE] THAT'S WEIRD. HOW MANY
VEGANS YOU KNOW THAT HUNT?

21:48.180 --> 21:49.720
[MAL] DEPENDS WHAT THEY'RE
AFTER. WHY?

21:49.760 --> 21:51.470
[JAKE] SHE'S GOT A BUNCH OF
DVDS, HERE.

21:51.520 --> 21:56.810
HUNTING TRIP MIDDLE EAST.
HUNTING TRIP GERMANY. THERE'S A
BUNCH OF THEM.

21:56.850 --> 21:59.480
[HEATHER] TELL ME
WHERE THE MICROFILM IS!

21:59.520 --> 22:01.480
[JAKE] DID SHE JUST SAY
MICROFILM?

22:01.530 --> 22:03.690
[MAL] THERE'S OUR "SPY".
[HEATHER] DO YOU WANT TO GET OUT
OF THIS ALIVE?

22:03.740 --> 22:06.820
[JAKE] REBECCA HAD A TAPE OF
HER HUSBAND'S KIDNAPPING?

22:06.860 --> 22:08.870
[MAL] YOU'D THINK SHE'D HAVE
PASSED THAT ON.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.120
[HEATHER] BUT YOU LEAVE ME NO
CHOICE.

22:14.160 --> 22:17.330
[JAKE] OH, NO, NO, LOOK. THE
DATE'S LIKE A YEAR AGO IN
DECEMBER.

22:23.590 --> 22:25.050
THERE'S OUR OTHER MAILMAN.

22:25.090 --> 22:27.090
[MAL] AND THERE'S OUR CLIENT.

22:32.350 --> 22:35.430
[JAKE] IS THIS, LIKE, SOME KIND
OF GAME--

22:35.480 --> 22:38.480
[REBECCA] THAT WAS SO GREAT!
[NATHAN] THAT WAS GOOD.

22:39.940 --> 22:41.610
[DES] DESIGNER KIDNAPPING.

22:41.650 --> 22:44.530
[ROSE] YUP, THE NEW FAD FOR
BORED PEOPLE WITH TOO MUCH
MONEY AND

22:44.570 --> 22:46.110
AN ADRENALINE ADDICTION.

22:46.150 --> 22:49.070
[MAL] WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GOING
TROUTING WITH A FEW BEERS?

22:49.110 --> 22:51.530
[JAKE] SO YOU WHAT? YOU HIRE
SOMEONE TO KIDNAP YOU?

22:51.580 --> 22:54.040
[DES] THE KIDNAPPER BASICALLY
PLAYS OUT ANY FANTASY YOU WANT.

22:54.080 --> 22:58.750
LIKE THIS ONE IS "WORLD WAR TWO
RESISTANCE FIGHTERS."

22:58.790 --> 23:06.470
BUT THEY'VE ALSO DONE TALIBAN,
CIA, IRA, MI-5-- OR 6, IT'S HARD
TO TELL

23:06.510 --> 23:09.510
THE DIFFERENCE ON SCREEN--
[ROSE] AND THE WEIRD
THING IS THERE'S NO COMPANY

23:09.550 --> 23:12.680
IN ST. JOHN'S
OFFERING THESE "SERVICES"

23:12.720 --> 23:14.350
[JAKE] BUTTER COMMERCIAL.

23:14.390 --> 23:15.600
[MAL] ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION?

23:15.640 --> 23:18.980
[JAKE] SHE'S IN A BUTTER
COMMERCIAL. I KNEW I KNEW HER.

23:19.020 --> 23:20.230
SHE'S A LOCAL ACTOR.

23:20.270 --> 23:21.650
[MAL] THEY HIRE AN ACTRESS TO
KIDNAP THEM--

23:21.690 --> 23:24.570
[JAKE] YEAH AND THEN HIRE US,
YOU KNOW TO SPICE IT UP A
LITTLE.

23:24.610 --> 23:26.990
[ROSE] RIGHT. WHICH IS WHY
ROBERT DROPPED THIS MATCHBOOK.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.610
TURNS OUT THAT'S FROM AN OLD
GAS STATION ON TORBAY ROAD.

23:29.650 --> 23:33.280
[JAKE] HUH, WELL, REBECCA'S NOT
ANSWERING HER PHONE.

23:33.330 --> 23:37.330
SHE MUST KNOW WE'RE ONTO HER.
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO HUNT HER
DOWN?

23:37.370 --> 23:38.790
[MAL] WHY? THE WHOLE THING IS
FAKE.

23:38.830 --> 23:41.540
[JAKE] IF SHE PAYS US, THE
MONEY'S NOT GOING TO BE FAKE.

23:41.580 --> 23:46.300
[ROSE] UH, NO NOT YOU, PAL. I
NEED TO TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

23:46.340 --> 23:49.590
[MAL] OH, OKAY. WHAT'S UP?

23:49.630 --> 23:50.930
[JAKE] I RATTED YOU OUT.

23:50.970 --> 23:53.600
I'M GOING TO THAT GAS STATION
FROM THE MATCHBOOK.

23:53.640 --> 23:57.220
[ROSE] SIX MONTHS AGO,
I WATCHED YOU IN THAT HOSPITAL
BED-- YOU NEARLY DIED.

23:57.270 --> 23:58.480
[MAL] I DIDN'T WANT
TO WORRY YOU

23:58.520 --> 24:00.140
[ROSE] WELL GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.770
YOU SHUT ME OUT ON SOMETHING
LIKE THIS AGAIN
AND I'LL CUT YOU.

24:01.810 --> 24:03.690
[MAL] SOUNDS DIRTY.

24:03.730 --> 24:05.610
[ROSE] YEAH, NO DIRTY FOR YOU
PAL. NOT UNTIL YOU'VE HAD A
HEART TEST DONE.

24:05.650 --> 24:07.650
WHICH YOU'RE GOING TOMORROW.

24:07.690 --> 24:09.860
I SET IT UP WITH NIKKI. OKAY?

24:16.790 --> 24:18.700
[DES] IT'S OKAY.

24:51.740 --> 24:56.620
[JAKE] LESLIE... WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE? WHY DO I GET THE SINKING

24:56.660 --> 24:59.370
FEELING THIS ALL HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH MY CLIENT?

24:59.410 --> 25:02.410
[LESLIE] I DON'T KNOW JAKE, YOU
TELL ME.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.460
[JAKE] OH, NATHAN, NATHAN...

25:10.550 --> 25:12.050
&lt;♪&gt;

25:12.090 --> 25:14.300
[ROSE] WE GOT THE OFFICIAL CAUSE
OF DEATH THIS MORNING.

25:14.340 --> 25:18.680
NATHAN JONES DIED FROM A
REACTION TO THE LATEX GLOVE
SHOVED DOWN HIS THROAT.

25:18.720 --> 25:21.600
[DES] "ANTIPATHETIC" SHOCK.
IT CAN KILL YOU IN A HEARTBEAT.

25:21.640 --> 25:23.520
[ROSE] ANAPHYLACTIC, HONEY.
[DES] EXACTLY.

25:23.560 --> 25:26.690
[JAKE] GUY'S ALLERGIC TO LATEX,
AND HIS WIFE DOESN'T
KNOW ABOUT IT?

25:26.730 --> 25:29.730
[MAL] AND HIS BEST FRIEND.
[ROSE] NOT TO MENTION
A HIRED KIDNAPPER.

25:29.770 --> 25:31.990
[MAL] BUT WHY WOULD ANY OF THEM
KILL NATHAN AFTER HE HIRED US?

25:32.030 --> 25:34.280
THEY KNEW WE'D BE
DIGGING AROUND.

25:34.320 --> 25:35.700
[ROSE] AN ACCIDENT?

25:35.740 --> 25:37.740
[JAKE] WE GOTTA FIND
THAT ACTRESS.

25:37.780 --> 25:39.580
MAYBE SHE CAN HELP STRAIGHTEN
SOME OF THIS OUT.

25:39.620 --> 25:45.620
[DES] I FOUND HER. NO AGENT.
NO WEBSITE. BUT CHECK OUT
HER CURRENT GIG.

25:50.380 --> 25:51.760
[JAKE] OH, YEAH.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.760
[HEATHER] THERE IS A HOME
IN THIS LANEWAY.

25:53.800 --> 25:59.350
THAT IS KNOWN BY MANY.
UNDERSTOOD BY FEW.

25:59.390 --> 26:04.430
UH, WHERE YOUR STANDING RIGHT
NOW, THE HISTORICAL WILCOTT'S
LANE--

26:04.480 --> 26:10.980
THERE WERE THREE SISTERS,
EACH ONE FAIRER...

26:11.020 --> 26:16.660
[JAKE] WE NEED TO SPEAK TO YE
CREEPY PRIEST OF OLDE. NOW.

26:23.700 --> 26:25.580
[MAL] BOO.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.670
THE END.

26:27.710 --> 26:29.790
[HEATHER] HE DIED??-- I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT.

26:29.830 --> 26:31.290
[MAL] SO YOU WEREN'T THERE?

26:31.330 --> 26:34.380
[HEATHER] I HAD SIX TOURS
THAT DAY. I LEFT RIGHT AFTER WE

26:34.420 --> 26:38.800
SNATCHED HIM. THIS IS CRAZY, IT
WAS JUST A STUPID GAME.

26:38.840 --> 26:42.180
[JAKE] SO WHY DID YOU BREAK INTO
REBECCA'S? YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE
GUN THING?

26:42.220 --> 26:45.560
[HEATHER] ROBERT TOLD ME TO.
HE TOLD ME TO STEAL THE LAPTOP.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.770
[JAKE] WHY?
[HEATHER] HE PICKED IT UP
FROM ME RIGHT AFTER.

26:47.810 --> 26:49.400
[HEATHER] ROBERT AND
NATHAN-- THEY ALWAYS WANTED IT

26:49.440 --> 26:51.940
RISKIER AND RISKIER. SOMETIMES I
THINK THEY FORGOT IT WAS

26:51.980 --> 26:53.570
JUST A GAME.

26:53.610 --> 26:57.820
[JAKE] YEAH. LOOK... YOU'RE
GOING TO NEED A LAWYER.

26:57.860 --> 27:01.530
OKAY? CALL HIM. WE'LL BE TELLING
THE POLICE WHERE TO FIND YOU.

27:01.570 --> 27:06.960
[HEATHER] OF COURSE. YES. THANK

27:07.000 --> 27:09.620
[MAL] WE SHOULD FIND ROBERT THE
MAILMAN ON HIS ROUTE.

27:09.670 --> 27:10.460
LET'S GO TALK TO HIM.

27:10.500 --> 27:13.590
[JAKE] YEAH... SORRY, SKIPPER.

27:13.630 --> 27:16.720
[NIKKI] HEART TEST TIME.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.720
[MAL] THE LEVEL OF BETRAYAL HERE
IS SHOCKING.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.720
[JAKE] I DON'T WANT YOU TO
DIE. SUE ME.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.850
[MAL] YOU SHOULD
WRITE GREETING CARDS.

27:22.890 --> 27:25.640
YOU'VE GOT A REAL
FLAIR FOR SENTIMENT.

27:27.810 --> 27:29.810
[NIKKI] HI, THERE.
[MAL] HI.

27:33.020 --> 27:35.360
[JAKE] HEY ROBERT, WE GOTTA

[ROBERT] WE'RE STILL ON?
I THOUGHT WE'D PULLED THE PLUG.

27:38.280 --> 27:39.820
[JAKE] SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING ON WITH?

27:39.860 --> 27:42.490
I JUST NEED TO TALK TO YOU
RIGHT NOW.

27:42.530 --> 27:44.280
[ROBERT] SO YOU'RE THE ENEMY.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.660
[JAKE] MAN, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE DELUSIONAL
OR STILL IN THE GAME.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.160
OR DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO NATHAN?

27:48.200 --> 27:50.290
[ROBERT] NATHAN DIDN'T
COOPERATE. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

27:50.330 --> 27:53.670
[JAKE] ROBERT,
THIS IS VERY SERIOUS.

27:53.710 --> 27:56.670
WE NEED TO TALK
TO THE POLICE RIGHT NOW.

27:56.710 --> 27:58.720
[ROBERT] YOU'LL NEVER
TAKE ME ALIVE.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.800
[JAKE] AND I'M NOT CHASING
AFTER YOU, YA MORON!

28:05.100 --> 28:09.890

YOU. AND TELL DAD TO MEET ME
THERE.

28:12.690 --> 28:15.070
WHEN HE'S FINISHED GETTING
HIS TICKER CHECKED.

28:16.900 --> 28:19.900
[TINNY] YOU JUST HAVE TO BE
REALLY CAREFUL WITH THE LIGHTS.

28:19.940 --> 28:21.200
BECAUSE THE ROOT SYSTEM
IS SO TINY, RIGHT NOW,

28:21.240 --> 28:23.030
THE CLONES CAN BURN REALLY EASY.

28:23.070 --> 28:24.990
[CHANTEL] HOW DID YOU EVEN LEARN
ALL THIS?

28:25.030 --> 28:28.580
[TINNY] YOU CAN FIND THE PLANS
FOR A NUCLEAR BOMB ON THE
INTERNET.

28:28.620 --> 28:29.620
CLONING IS SIMPLE.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.080
[DES] THE GIRLS ARE CLONING.

28:33.120 --> 28:37.130
REPEAT, CLONING. STAY TUNED.

28:40.590 --> 28:44.180
[JAKE] ROBERT! ROBERT!

28:47.810 --> 28:50.850
[MAL] I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU RATTED
ME OUT. ME OWN SON.

28:50.890 --> 28:53.390
DO HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THOSE
"DOCTORS" JUST DID TO ME.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.520
[JAKE] WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP
SOOKING.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.940
ALL RIGHT? BE A MAN. YOU'RE
REALLY GETTING ON MY NERVES.

28:59.980 --> 29:02.820
[MAL] YOU'RE GETTING EDGY. HOW
LONG HAS THE MORATORIUM BEEN
NOW?

29:02.860 --> 29:04.950
STARTING TO GIVE YOU THE BENDS?

29:04.990 --> 29:07.530
[JAKE] EVERY TIME I TRY TO
MAKE A CHANGE, TRY TO BETTER
MYSELF

29:07.580 --> 29:10.910
I GET YOU STANDING OVER ME
MAKING COMMENTS

29:10.950 --> 29:13.040
[MAL] RIGHT. AND I'M THE SOOK.

29:13.080 --> 29:18.750
[JAKE] JUST CHECK THE DRAWERS
OR WHATEVER. WE GOTTA FIND SOME
PROOF TO FIGURE OUT WHY

29:18.800 --> 29:20.130
ROBERT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIS
BEST FRIEND.

29:20.170 --> 29:23.340
[MAL] JAKE-- YOU MIGHT BE THE
BEST DETECTIVE I'VE EVER KNOWN,

29:23.380 --> 29:25.930
BUT AS A PERSON-- YOU'RE AN
ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.

29:25.970 --> 29:27.800
[JAKE] WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

29:27.850 --> 29:30.140
[MAL] I SAID, YOU'RE AN
EMOTIONAL TRAIN WRECK WITH
BEHAVIOURAL DISORDERS.

29:30.180 --> 29:31.930
[JAKE] NO, NO, NO, BEFORE THAT.
[MAL] I CALLED YOU A MORON?

29:31.980 --> 29:33.940
[JAKE] NO, YOU SAID I WAS
THE BEST DETECTIVE
YOU'VE EVER KNOWN.

29:33.980 --> 29:34.980
[MAL] NO, I DIDN'T.

29:35.020 --> 29:37.980
[JAKE] YES, YOU DID. THIS

REBECCA AND NATHAN, THEY HAD

[JAKE] SO BUDDY KILLS HIS
BEST FRIEND, AND HE JUST HAPPENS

29:56.210 --> 29:59.840
SUPPOSED MURDER WEAPON

30:01.920 --> 30:07.010
[ROBERT] STILL ON THE JOB? MAN,

30:24.030 --> 30:27.950
[JAKE] HE LOOK LIKE
A MURDERER TO YOU?
[MAL] IT'S HARD TO SAY.

30:29.450 --> 30:31.450
[LESLIE] WHAT WERE YOU TWO
DOING IN HIS APARTMENT?

30:31.490 --> 30:33.620
AND WHY ARE YOU STILL MEDDLING
IN THIS CASE?

30:33.660 --> 30:36.710
[JAKE] LESLIE I KNOW THIS LOOKS
BAD, I GET THAT.

30:36.750 --> 30:38.460
[MAL] YOU THINK HE KILLED NATHAN
JONES?

30:38.500 --> 30:40.210
[LESLIE] HIS FINGERPRINTS ARE
ALL OVER THE CRIME SCENE.

30:40.250 --> 30:43.050
LOOK, HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO SAY THIS?

30:43.090 --> 30:46.090
BOTH OF YOU,
STAY OUT OF IT, PLEASE.

30:46.130 --> 30:48.300
[JAKE] TURN THAT UP, HUH.

30:48.340 --> 30:50.680
[MAL] WELL, IT'S CLEAR WHY
LESLIE WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH
YOU.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.060
YOU NEVER LISTEN TO
A WORD SHE SAYS.

30:53.100 --> 30:55.980
[JAKE] I LISTEN. I JUST HAVE A
PROBLEM WITH THE OBEYING PART.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.020
[ROBERT] WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

30:57.060 --> 30:58.900
[HOOD] NATHAN JONES IS DEAD.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.980
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

31:01.020 --> 31:05.230
[ROBERT] AH-- YESTERDAY. WE

31:05.280 --> 31:11.070
[HOOD] YEAH. REALLY.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.080
[LESLIE] WHAT ABOUT
REBECCA JONES?

31:13.120 --> 31:16.250
[ROBERT] SHE CALLED ME TODAY
ASKED ME ABOUT
NATHAN AND THE GIRL.

31:16.290 --> 31:17.790
[LESLIE] WHAT GIRL?

31:17.830 --> 31:20.460
[ROBERT] HEATHER, HE WAS
SEEING HER, AN ACTRESS, AND

31:20.500 --> 31:24.460
AND, AND HE MADE A TAPE
WITH HER, YOU KNOW.

31:24.500 --> 31:27.170
WITH SEX AND REBECCA FOUND IT

31:27.220 --> 31:29.680
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ALL A
GAME, YOU KNOW?

31:29.720 --> 31:34.760
AND THEY, THEY, THEY WENT TOO
FAR. THEY WOULD ALWAYS, ALWAYS
GO TOO FAR.

31:34.810 --> 31:38.060
[JAKE] OKAY, IF REBECCA FOUND
THAT FLASH DRIVE

31:38.100 --> 31:41.150
AND SHE KILLED NATHAN...
[MAL] HEATHER COULD BE NEXT.

31:41.190 --> 31:44.770
[JAKE] AND YOU KNOW, I DON'T
THINK THAT LESLIE IS GONNA BE
TOO INTERESTED IN OUR

31:44.820 --> 31:46.650

OUT CHANTEL. NOW, GET OUT OF
HERE AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

33:50.270 --> 33:53.030
[DES] YOU'RE GOING TO LONDON?

33:53.070 --> 33:56.860
[TINNY] MAYBE.

33:56.910 --> 34:00.080
[DES] SURVEILLANCE TEMPORARILY
SUSPENDED DUE TO WHAT FEELS
LIKE A PUNCTURED LUNG.

34:05.080 --> 34:07.080
[MAL] REBECCA! CAN'T YOU
PICK THE LOCK?

34:07.120 --> 34:08.920
[JAKE] I'M TRY-- I'M TRYING, I'M
TRYING.

34:08.960 --> 34:12.210
[MAL] GET OUT OF THE WAY.

34:12.260 --> 34:14.800
SOMEONE DID A JOB
ON THIS PLACE.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.050
[JAKE] YEAH.

34:19.720 --> 34:21.720
WHERE'S THE MATA HARI?

34:28.480 --> 34:29.940
HUH!

34:31.230 --> 34:36.740
LOOKS LIKE NATHAN HAD A LITTLE
HIDING PLACE, BUT FOR WHAT?

34:36.780 --> 34:40.950
[MAL] A FLASH DRIVE.

34:40.990 --> 34:43.700
JAKE, LOOK AT THIS.

34:43.740 --> 34:45.750
[HEATHER] YOU'VE BEEN A VERY BAD
MAN.

34:45.790 --> 34:46.910
[MAL] WHO'S SHE SUPPOSED TO BE?

34:46.960 --> 34:48.540
[JAKE] MATA HARI?

34:48.580 --> 34:51.130
[HEATHER] YOU WANT TO BE
PUNISHED?
[NATHAN] YES.

34:51.170 --> 34:54.670
&lt;WHIPPING&gt;
[JAKE] SHE'S VERY TALENTED.

34:54.710 --> 34:56.130
[HEATHER] HOW'S THAT?

34:56.170 --> 34:56.970
[NATHAN] YES, MORE!

34:57.010 --> 34:58.470
[HEATHER] MORE?

34:58.510 --> 35:01.890
[NATHAN] YES.
[MAL] BE LIKE A REGULAR FRIDAY
NIGHT FOR YOU.

35:01.930 --> 35:04.600
[JAKE] OKAY, YEAH, YEAH,
[HEATHER] YOU'VE BEEN A VERY BAD
MAN.

35:04.640 --> 35:08.020
ENOUGH OF THE HARD STUFF, YOU'VE
GOT A HEART CONDITION.

35:08.060 --> 35:11.110
I THINK I SHOULD CALL REBECCA.

35:11.150 --> 35:13.270
[MAL] WHAT WOULD YOU
DO TO OUR DOMINATRIX FRIEND HERE

35:13.320 --> 35:14.190
IF YOU WERE REBECCA?

35:14.230 --> 35:15.650
[JAKE] SHHH.

35:24.410 --> 35:29.330
[JAKE] THIS IS REBECCA'S
PHONE. SEE IF SHE GOT ANY TEXT
MESSAGES.

35:29.370 --> 35:33.250
[JAKE] LOOK AT THAT. MEET ME AT
THE SPOT, GOTTA TALK TO YOU.

35:33.290 --> 35:36.380
[JAKE] HEATHER SENT THAT TO
REBECCA LIKE TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES
AGO.

35:36.420 --> 35:37.510
[JAKE] LET'S GO.
[MAL] WHERE?

35:37.550 --> 35:38.340
[JAKE] TO "THE SPOT."

35:38.380 --> 35:43.760
&lt;♪&gt;

35:43.800 --> 35:45.810
THERE'S REBECCA'S CAR.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.190
[MAL] SO REBECCA LURED HEATHER
BACK TO THE BARN. SHE WANTS TO

35:55.230 --> 35:57.320
KILL HEATHER IN THE SAME SPOT
SHE KILLED HER HUSBAND.

35:57.360 --> 35:59.490
[JAKE] NAH, I DON'T THINK SO.

35:59.530 --> 36:01.610
[MAL] AFTER WATCHING THAT LITTLE
SKIT ON THE FLASH DRIVE I
DON'T KNOW WHY SHE WOULDN'T?

36:01.660 --> 36:03.530
JEALOUSY'S A POWERFUL MOTIVE.

36:03.570 --> 36:06.950
[JAKE] JEALOUSY IS A POWERFUL
MOTIVE FOR REBECCA TODAY. NATHAN
WAS KILLED YESTERDAY.

36:06.990 --> 36:10.580
BUT I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT
ONE THING, IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH
THAT FLASH DRIVE.

36:11.420 --> 36:12.170
[JAKE] WAIT.

36:13.790 --> 36:17.210
[REBECCA] HOW LONG? HOW LONG
WERE YOU AND NATHAN HAVING AN
AFFAIR?

36:17.250 --> 36:18.090
[HEATHER] IT WASN'T AN AFFAIR.

36:18.130 --> 36:19.170
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

36:19.210 --> 36:22.010
[REBECCA] DON'T LIE TO ME. I SAW
IT ALL.

36:22.050 --> 36:23.800
[HEATHER] HE OFFERED ME TEN
THOUSAND DOLLARS TO MAKE THAT

36:23.840 --> 36:25.550
VIDEO. I WAS GOING TO GO TO L.A.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.970
[REBECCA] YOU'RE LYING HE
WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

36:28.020 --> 36:31.190
[HEATHER] HE DID AND THEN HE
SAID HE'D PUT IT ALL OVER THE
INTERNET

36:31.230 --> 36:32.940
IF I DIDN'T KEEP PLAYING HIS
PERVERTED LITTLE GAMES.

36:32.980 --> 36:34.110
[JAKE] THERE'S YOUR MOTIVE.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.480
[REBECCA] YOU'RE A LIAR! YOU'RE
BOTH LIARS!

36:36.520 --> 36:40.240
[HEATHER] SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
[REBECCA] WHAT?

36:40.280 --> 36:42.990
[MAL] THERE'S YOUR MURDERER.

36:43.030 --> 36:45.450
[REBECCA] YOU'RE GOING TO SHOOT
ME?
[HEATHER] I'M SORRY.

36:45.490 --> 36:49.870
[HEATHER] IT WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN. I DIDN'T KNOW
THE GLOVE WOULD KILL HIM.

36:49.910 --> 36:58.460
[REBECCA] KILL HIM? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT? NATHAN'S DEAD?

36:58.500 --> 37:02.380
[HEATHER] I'M SO SORRY. I JUST,
I REALLY NEED THAT FLASH DRIVE.

37:02.430 --> 37:04.680
SO OKAY PLEASE.

37:04.720 --> 37:06.350
&lt;GUNSHOT&gt;

37:09.430 --> 37:11.430
[HEATHER] I'M SO SORRY!
I'M SO SORRY!

37:11.480 --> 37:14.400
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT.
I JUST NEED THAT FLASH DRIVE.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.020
PLEASE.
[JAKE] I HAVE IT.
I HAVE THE FLASH DRIVE.

37:17.060 --> 37:20.440
&lt;GUNSHOTS&gt;

37:20.480 --> 37:22.450
[JAKE] OKAY, I DON'T. I DON'T
HAVE IT!

37:22.490 --> 37:24.490
JUST STOP, STOP SHOOTING AT ME!

37:24.530 --> 37:27.280
[HEATHER] OKAY SORRY! SO DO
YOU HAVE IT OR NOT?

37:27.320 --> 37:29.080
[JAKE] ARE YOU GOING TO STOP
SHOOTING AT ME?

37:29.120 --> 37:31.450
[HEATHER] YES.
[JAKE] OKAY, I HAVE IT.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.460
&lt;GUNSHOT&gt;
[HEATHER] AH! SORRY, SORRY,
SORRY!

37:33.500 --> 37:36.380
[JACK] PUT THE SAFETY ON HER...

37:36.420 --> 37:37.790
[HEATHER] OK, OK.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.550
[JAKE] OKAY, I'M COMING OUT
[HEATHER] OK

37:40.590 --> 37:42.590
&lt;GUNSHOTS&gt;

37:44.800 --> 37:47.800
&lt;♪&gt;

38:00.570 --> 38:02.190
&lt;GUNSHOT&gt;

38:04.650 --> 38:06.610
[MAL] GAME OVER.

38:06.660 --> 38:09.660
&lt;♪&gt;

38:12.910 --> 38:15.920
&lt;♪&gt;

38:29.550 --> 38:32.470
[MAL] SO YOU THINK YOU IMPRESSED
HER?

38:32.520 --> 38:34.520
[JAKE] I'M GONNA GO FIND OUT.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.980
[MAL] HOW AM I GOING
TO GET HOME?

38:40.730 --> 38:43.360
HEY ROSE, HONEY, I'M HOME.

38:44.360 --> 38:49.490
OH... THE FIRING SQUAD HAS
ARRIVED. SO...

38:49.530 --> 38:52.540
WHAT'S UP? AM I DEAD?

38:54.500 --> 38:58.500
[NIKKI] NO. BUT WE DO NEED TO
ADJUST YOUR MEDICATION.

39:04.550 --> 39:08.470
[NIKKI] ONE SHOT, ONCE A MONTH
AND YOU SHOULD BE OKAY.

39:08.510 --> 39:12.350
BUT I AM A DOCTOR, SO THAT
ISN'T FORMAL ADVICE.
I WILL DENY IT IN COURT.

39:12.390 --> 39:15.810
[MAL] HOW LONG HAVE I GOT?
[NIKKI] AT LEAST TWO OR
THREE DECADES--

39:15.850 --> 39:17.940
YOU'RE GONNA BE
TOTALLY FINE, MAL.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.400
GOOD AS GOLD.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.810
[MAL] THAT'S A RELIEF.

39:20.860 --> 39:22.520
[ROSE] HEY, HOW'S THE
ASSIGNMENT GOING?

39:22.570 --> 39:25.570
[DES] YEAH IT'S ALL COMING.
I JUST GOTTA MAKE A FEW
FINISHING TOUCHES.

39:25.610 --> 39:27.570
I'LL HAVE IT ALL
ON YOUR DESK. HI.

39:27.610 --> 39:30.360
&lt;♪&gt;

39:45.630 --> 39:47.380
[JAKE] SO YOU'RE
ALL BETTER, THEN?

39:47.420 --> 39:50.510
[MAL] MORE PILLS, LESS SALT
BEEF. YOU SHOULD COME HOME.

39:50.550 --> 39:52.300
CELEBRATE WITH US.

39:52.340 --> 39:55.140
[JAKE] YEAH I'D LIKE TO, BUT,
UH, THERE'S SOMETHING I GOTTA DO
FIRST.

39:55.180 --> 39:58.560
[MAL] I'M GUESSING THIS CELIBACY
THING IS OUT THE WINDOW THEN.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.400
[JAKE] AH HA WOULD YOU
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE...

40:01.440 --> 40:04.440
STOP TALKING ABOUT MY SEX LIFE.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.440
AND I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

40:08.490 --> 40:09.990
[MAL] NOT AS GLAD AS ME.

40:10.030 --> 40:13.030
SEE YOU LATER.
[JAKE] SEE YOU LATER, SKIPPER.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.670
[MAYOR] SERGEANT BENNETT.

40:24.710 --> 40:26.340
[LESLIE] MAYOR.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.670
[JAKE] WALTER,
I GOTTA GO GET DRUNK.

41:03.710 --> 41:06.460
&lt;♪&gt;

41:19.010 --> 41:21.430
[TOM] SO, DO YOU
CHARGE BY THE HOUR?

41:21.480 --> 41:22.810
[ALLISON] WELL TOM, I'M NOT
CHEAP.

41:22.850 --> 41:26.980
THAT'S FOR SURE. I DON'T THINK
YOU COULD AFFORD ME.

41:27.020 --> 41:30.440
[TOM] COME ON, HOW EXPENSIVE?

41:30.480 --> 41:34.700
[ALLISON] WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
MY HOURLY RATE IS PROBABLY

41:34.740 --> 41:36.410
MORE THAN YOUR YOUR WEEKLY
SALARY.

41:36.450 --> 41:37.780
[TOM] SERIOUSLY?

41:37.830 --> 41:40.450
[ALLISON] SERIOUSLY.

41:40.490 --> 41:42.410
BUT BELIEVE ME, I'M WORTH IT.

41:55.590 --> 41:57.760
SO YOU LIKE TO EAVESDROP?

41:57.800 --> 42:01.020
[JAKE] YEAH, I'M SORRY.
IT'S A FORCE OF HABIT.

42:01.060 --> 42:03.730
[ALLISON] REALLY?

42:03.770 --> 42:08.190
[JAKE] AND I HAVE TO SAY, FOR
THE RECORD, YOU'RE WAY OUT OF MY
RANGE AS WELL.

42:08.230 --> 42:14.530
AND MY LEAGUE IN GENERAL.
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS...

42:14.570 --> 42:16.410
YOU CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN ME.

42:16.450 --> 42:17.990
[ALLISON] IS THAT RIGHT?

42:18.030 --> 42:22.750
[JAKE] OBVIOUSLY. I DON'T WANT
TO WASTE TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.330
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

42:24.370 --> 42:25.710
[ALLISON] SURE.

42:25.750 --> 42:27.750
[JAKE] I DON'T THINK
I EVER COULD, YOU KNOW...

42:27.790 --> 42:32.460
PARTAKE IN THAT KIND OF THING,
YOUR KIND OF THING.

42:32.500 --> 42:34.260
BUT UH...

42:34.300 --> 42:35.800
DO YOU REALLY MAKE THAT MUCH?

42:35.840 --> 42:38.640
[ALLISON] WELL I MADE MORE
WHEN I WAS ON MY OWN.

42:38.680 --> 42:40.550
[JAKE] ON YOUR OWN?

42:40.600 --> 42:45.100
[ALLISON] YEAH. I MEAN, I'M
MORE OF LIKE A EXCLUSIVE
GOVERMENT WORKER NOW.

42:45.140 --> 42:49.730
[JAKE] WELL THAT IS THE BEST USE
OF TAX DOLLARS THAT I'VE EVER
HEARD OF.

42:49.770 --> 42:50.310
[ALLISON] THANK YOU.

42:50.360 --> 42:51.320
[JAKE] CHEERS!

42:51.360 --> 42:52.730
[ALLISON] CHEERS.

42:56.900 --> 42:59.450
[JAKE] IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME
THAT YOU'RE WORTH IT.

42:59.490 --> 43:04.790
I JUST HOPE, I MEAN I PRAY
REALLY, THAT I NEVER END UP
HAVING TO, YOU KNOW...

43:04.830 --> 43:07.410
PAY FOR SEX.
[ALLISON] PAY FOR SEX?

43:07.460 --> 43:10.000
[WALTER] HEY, THERE YOU ARE!
OH GOOD, YOU RAN INTO EACH
OTHER.

43:10.040 --> 43:13.800
THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S GOOD,
'CAUSE I WAS GOING TO
INTRODUCE YOU ANYWAY.

43:13.840 --> 43:16.170
ALLISON JENKINS,
THIS IS JAKE DOYLE.

43:16.220 --> 43:18.590
ALLISON'S THE NEW
CROWN ATTORNEY.

43:20.800 --> 43:23.140
[JAKE] OF COURSE YOU ARE.

43:23.180 --> 43:24.810
[WALTER] YEAH YOU'RE GONNA RUN
INTO JAKE A LOT, TOO.

43:24.850 --> 43:27.810
THE CROWN HIRES HIM ALL THE
TIME. HE'S A PRIVATE DICK.

43:27.850 --> 43:30.600
[ALLISON] DICK, HUH?
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

43:36.240 --> 43:39.240
&lt;♪&gt;
