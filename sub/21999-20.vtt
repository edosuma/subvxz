00:44.697 --> 00:47.098
Your car is... 17 minutes away.

00:59.501 --> 01:02.313
Guess what I did today.

01:02.315 --> 01:05.007
I played hooky.

01:05.284 --> 01:08.252
Had my teaching assistant
cover my two classes.

01:08.254 --> 01:10.654
And I went to a pub, sat by myself

01:10.656 --> 01:14.266
and read something
that I did not have to read.

01:17.978 --> 01:20.431
What the hell are you doing over there?

01:26.739 --> 01:28.405
Where are you going?

01:28.407 --> 01:30.374
Not going anywhere.

01:30.376 --> 01:34.111
I just thought this thing takes
up so much room in the closet.

01:34.113 --> 01:36.213
Might make more sense keeping it...

01:36.215 --> 01:39.283
under the bed, but... doesn't fit.

01:39.285 --> 01:40.918
Really?

01:47.226 --> 01:49.426
Not going anywhere?

01:51.030 --> 01:54.331
Who do you think
you're messing with...

01:54.333 --> 01:55.666
Haven't we...

01:55.668 --> 01:57.735
already been through this?

01:57.737 --> 02:00.137
I wasn't... I needed to
get away for a bit

02:00.139 --> 02:02.606
just to... to write and to think.

02:02.608 --> 02:04.441
That's a bunch of crap, Kate.

02:04.443 --> 02:07.511
That is a bunch of crap!

02:08.814 --> 02:10.614
We both know that you don't write.

02:10.616 --> 02:12.449
Okay, buying garbage on the Internet

02:12.451 --> 02:15.519
that you don't need is not writing.

02:15.521 --> 02:20.024
Reading articles that other
people wrote is not writing.

02:20.026 --> 02:22.326
I'm sorry.

02:22.328 --> 02:24.795
I should have... I should have told you,

02:24.797 --> 02:27.431
not surprised you.

02:27.433 --> 02:31.035
I just... I knew you'd be upset.

02:32.305 --> 02:34.405
You have any idea

02:34.407 --> 02:38.008
how stupid that accent makes you sound?

02:38.678 --> 02:41.212
Say it again.

02:43.249 --> 02:46.083
Say "I'm sorry," and say
it without the accent.

02:48.321 --> 02:50.054
I'm... sorry.

02:51.543 --> 02:54.124
I'm so s-sorry.

02:55.995 --> 02:57.452
Okay.

02:57.997 --> 02:59.496
You can do it.

03:00.872 --> 03:02.533
Let's see what else you can do.

03:15.881 --> 03:18.983
No.

03:18.985 --> 03:21.351
No, this is Kate Martin's
husband. Who's this?

03:21.977 --> 03:24.488
I'm sorry.

03:24.490 --> 03:26.590
Yeah, she changed her mind.

03:26.592 --> 03:28.826
Yeah, Kate Martin isn't
going anywhere today.

03:36.602 --> 03:39.036
Katie, what are you doing?

03:39.939 --> 03:42.205
Doesn't matter where you go.

03:43.042 --> 03:44.666
I'm gonna find you...

03:46.043 --> 03:47.678
and I'll bring you back here.

03:51.048 --> 03:52.616
I did it before.

03:54.487 --> 03:56.920
I'll do it again.

05:08.427 --> 05:10.427
Hey, where's Benny?

05:10.836 --> 05:12.129
Downstairs, I think.

05:12.131 --> 05:13.397
All right.

05:14.005 --> 05:15.251
And that's...

05:15.253 --> 05:16.600
that's an amazing gift.

05:16.602 --> 05:18.068
Well, she's an amazing girl.

05:18.070 --> 05:19.370
Benny?

05:19.372 --> 05:21.405
Your sister called me
three times last night.

05:21.407 --> 05:23.040
Hung up before I could answer.

05:23.432 --> 05:24.632
Something I should know about?

05:25.100 --> 05:28.379
You got me, but if she called
you, you should call her.

05:28.381 --> 05:31.189
I did. I left a couple of
voicemails; She never returned.

05:32.385 --> 05:34.518
Can't be an alimony thing.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.553
I mean, it's not an alimony thing, right?

05:36.555 --> 05:38.722
I have no idea, but you know Izzy.

05:38.724 --> 05:40.224
She's not shy.

05:40.226 --> 05:42.426
If she has something important
to tell you...

05:42.428 --> 05:45.396
Point taken. Yeah..

05:51.168 --> 05:52.736
Good morning to you, too.

05:52.738 --> 05:55.072
Sorry. I just have a bad
feeling about something.

05:55.074 --> 05:56.473
Well, I want to warn you.

05:56.475 --> 05:58.308
I-I just put Dr. Grint in your office.

05:58.310 --> 06:00.110
Dr. Grint from the
Survivors' Justice Project?

06:00.112 --> 06:01.345
Is she looking for money?

06:01.347 --> 06:03.847
- I have no idea.
- 'Cause now is not the time.

06:03.849 --> 06:06.316
Izzy's been calling me, and
I... I just have a sense

06:06.318 --> 06:07.918
something's up, and it's gonna cost me.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.454
All I know is she said it was important.

06:10.456 --> 06:12.623
Okay.

06:14.565 --> 06:16.894
Dr. Grint. Marian.

06:16.896 --> 06:19.296
For the millionth time... Marian.

06:19.298 --> 06:22.111
What can I do for you... Marian?

06:22.112 --> 06:25.346
Dr. Bull, you once told me
if I ever needed a favor...

06:25.348 --> 06:26.981
I've been seeing her on
and off for two years,

06:26.983 --> 06:28.283
urging her to get out.

06:28.285 --> 06:30.418
- And of course she didn't.
- Of course she didn't.

06:30.420 --> 06:32.053
Now she's being charged with murder.

06:32.055 --> 06:34.255
Well, that's what happens
when you kill someone.

06:34.257 --> 06:36.391
She's been appointed a public defender.

06:36.393 --> 06:37.592
Sounds about right.

06:37.594 --> 06:40.161
And I was hoping you
might whisper in his ear

06:40.163 --> 06:42.393
about juries and who to look for

06:42.395 --> 06:43.592
and all that good stuff that

06:43.617 --> 06:44.820
you're so wonderful at.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.367
Happy to do it, but the truth is,

06:46.369 --> 06:48.436
I'm sure whoever they've given
your client is more

06:48.438 --> 06:50.672
than up to the task,
and I don't need to tell you,

06:50.674 --> 06:53.241
the courts see a lot
of these kinds of cases.

06:53.243 --> 06:56.311
And there's nothing unusual
or exotic about it.

06:56.313 --> 06:58.246
She shot him in the back.

06:59.850 --> 07:01.916
Okay. That makes it
a touch more complicated,

07:01.918 --> 07:04.319
but presumably,
it was self-defense, so...

07:04.321 --> 07:06.521
While he was fast asleep.

07:08.091 --> 07:10.225
That's a tough one.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.186
What have we here?

07:16.294 --> 07:18.689
Dr. Jason Bull, this is Mark Burns.

07:18.691 --> 07:21.359
Mark has been appointed
Kate's public defender.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.594
Mark, Dr. Jason Bull.

07:23.596 --> 07:26.330
I'm, just here to help.
It's your show.

07:26.332 --> 07:28.499
Well, it's pretty cut and dried.
It's not rocket science.

07:28.501 --> 07:30.206
It's one of those stories
I can pretty much

07:30.208 --> 07:32.303
tell you the ending of
right now, but I'm happy

07:32.305 --> 07:33.938
to listen to anything you have to say.

07:33.940 --> 07:35.573
Is she with us?

07:35.575 --> 07:38.075
That's the enemy.

07:38.077 --> 07:40.211
That's A.D.A. Amy Lake.
She's a tough one.

07:40.213 --> 07:41.812
But I've been talking to her,

07:41.814 --> 07:43.748
seeing if we can't find
some common ground.

07:43.750 --> 07:45.279
What's she doing here?

07:45.281 --> 07:47.066
Same thing I'm doing,
waiting for the judge.

07:47.068 --> 07:48.737
The girl's banged up pretty good.

07:48.738 --> 07:50.772
She's got a couple of broken
ribs and a punctured lung.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.473
They're still doing some tests, but...

07:52.475 --> 07:55.543
they want to do the arraignment
here in the hospital.

07:57.460 --> 07:59.380
You think I can have
a few minutes with her?

07:59.382 --> 08:01.057
The accused, I mean?

08:01.430 --> 08:02.863
Of course.

08:11.141 --> 08:12.293
Sorry.

08:12.809 --> 08:14.728
I should have warned you.

08:16.146 --> 08:18.399
They do look somewhat alike, don't they?

08:20.473 --> 08:21.636
She and her husband

08:21.638 --> 08:23.404
have been married almost four years.

08:23.406 --> 08:25.173
He taught writing at Hudson.

08:25.175 --> 08:28.176
Apparently, he's one
of their most popular teachers.

08:29.846 --> 08:31.813
It didn't help that he was smart.

08:31.815 --> 08:34.649
He only hit her in places
that clothing covered...

08:35.081 --> 08:36.384
until now.

08:37.250 --> 08:41.022
And she was the kind of wife...
never went to the police.

08:42.380 --> 08:45.827
She went to the emergency
room once last year.

08:46.217 --> 08:48.463
Paid cash, gave a false name.

08:48.465 --> 08:50.013
Still.

08:51.431 --> 08:52.800
He was sleeping.

08:52.802 --> 08:55.003
It's really gonna be a tough sell.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.940
Why now?

09:00.377 --> 09:02.543
You her family?

09:02.545 --> 09:05.280
If she wakes up, tell her
we just got the test back.

09:05.987 --> 09:07.382
The baby's fine.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.391
Aren't we being a little dramatic?

09:16.998 --> 09:18.593
You got something
against hospital cafeterias?

09:18.595 --> 09:21.696
They serve coffee. They have... walls.

09:23.004 --> 09:24.532
Did you know she was pregnant?

09:25.006 --> 09:26.367
Nine weeks.

09:26.883 --> 09:28.369
Doesn't change anything.

09:28.843 --> 09:30.872
She shot him in the back
while he lay sleeping.

09:30.874 --> 09:32.540
That's all the jury's gonna hear.

09:32.542 --> 09:34.709
You ever heard of
"battered woman syndrome"?

09:34.711 --> 09:36.377
They have a syndrome now?

09:36.379 --> 09:39.865
My older sister was
married to a gym teacher.

09:39.867 --> 09:42.216
Ran the youth ministry at church.

09:42.218 --> 09:43.785
Chaired the big school carnival

09:43.787 --> 09:46.054
to raise money for cancer research.

09:46.056 --> 09:47.555
And when they'd fight...

09:47.557 --> 09:50.692
which apparently was more
than anybody realized...

09:50.694 --> 09:53.828
he'd get her on the
ground and... kick her.

09:54.494 --> 09:55.963
He weighed 215.

09:55.965 --> 09:57.598
She weighed 122.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.568
And one day, he kicked her too hard.

10:01.149 --> 10:02.737
Ruptured her spleen.

10:04.254 --> 10:06.874
And six hours later, she was gone.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.676
I'm sorry.

10:08.678 --> 10:11.412
But I know that you know that
has nothing to do with this.

10:11.414 --> 10:13.348
I'm telling you, I have this handled.

10:13.350 --> 10:15.216
I've been huddling with the A.D.A.

10:15.218 --> 10:16.818
They're gonna try her
for first-degree murder...

10:16.820 --> 10:18.753
Is that your applause line?

10:18.755 --> 10:21.756
Reducible to second degree
manslaughter, which means

10:21.758 --> 10:24.399
that all we have to do
is create some kind of doubt,

10:24.401 --> 10:26.961
and then we've got a 90% chance
that the jury's gonna convict

10:26.963 --> 10:28.262
on the lesser plea, and she's looking

10:28.264 --> 10:29.630
at seven to eight years instead of life.

10:29.632 --> 10:31.733
You've given up on her already.

10:31.735 --> 10:34.602
Her being found innocent
isn't even on your menu.

10:34.604 --> 10:36.704
She isn't innocent.
She shot him in the back

10:36.706 --> 10:38.039
while he was sleeping.

10:38.041 --> 10:39.240
Have you spoken with her?

10:39.242 --> 10:40.808
Have you conferred with your client?

10:40.810 --> 10:42.410
No. She's been sedated, but what is it

10:42.412 --> 10:43.644
that you think she would say?

10:44.586 --> 10:46.047
You're fired.

10:46.049 --> 10:47.422
Excuse me?

10:48.423 --> 10:50.318
Okay. Two things.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.853
I didn't ask for this job,

10:51.855 --> 10:53.254
You're not the one who hired me.

10:53.845 --> 10:56.290
Trust me. By the time you get downstairs,

10:56.292 --> 10:58.459
I'll make sure you're fired,

10:58.461 --> 11:00.836
unless you go to the judge and you demand

11:00.838 --> 11:03.678
that she be tried on first-
degree murder charges,

11:03.680 --> 11:05.696
only first-degree.

11:06.095 --> 11:07.702
It's all or nothing.

11:08.188 --> 11:09.470
You're out of your mind.

11:09.472 --> 11:12.006
And you're out of your depth.

11:12.361 --> 11:13.794
And you're fired.

11:14.809 --> 11:16.676
Fine by me.

11:17.353 --> 11:19.320
I'm sure it is.

11:24.693 --> 11:26.893
Benjamin Colón.

11:26.961 --> 11:28.890
It's time to go to work.

11:41.187 --> 11:44.214
This happy couple is
Kate and Brian Martin.

11:44.239 --> 11:46.497
He was a writing professor
at Hudson College.

11:46.499 --> 11:49.242
She had her master's and was
working on her first novel.

11:49.244 --> 11:51.863
In addition to being a serial adulterer,

11:51.865 --> 11:55.269
Kate claims he physically
and psychologically abused her

11:55.294 --> 11:57.394
for at least the past three years.

11:57.867 --> 11:59.997
Last week, while eight weeks pregnant

11:59.999 --> 12:03.968
with their first child, she shot
him in the back while he slept.

12:05.204 --> 12:08.305
Then she went to sleep
while he bled out next to her.

12:08.307 --> 12:09.406
God.

12:09.408 --> 12:10.741
Sounds horrible.

12:10.743 --> 12:13.210
- I gather she's our client?
- Yes, she is.

12:13.212 --> 12:14.779
And it is horrible.

12:14.781 --> 12:17.047
It's also daunting from
a legal perspective.

12:17.049 --> 12:19.884
I mean, how do you prove
that shooting someone

12:19.886 --> 12:22.453
while they slept is,
in fact, self-defense?

12:22.851 --> 12:24.789
Between you and me,
I don't think you can.

12:24.791 --> 12:28.359
Your opinion notwithstanding,
Bull believes she's innocent.

12:28.361 --> 12:30.094
In fact, he believes it so strongly

12:30.096 --> 12:32.997
that he and I argued in
front of a judge yesterday

12:32.999 --> 12:36.000
that the only charge that
the jury should consider

12:36.002 --> 12:37.835
is first-degree murder.

12:37.837 --> 12:39.804
No lesser charges,

12:39.806 --> 12:42.473
no manslaughter, no assault
with a deadly weapon...

12:42.475 --> 12:44.074
it's all or nothing.

12:44.581 --> 12:47.344
Life in prison or no jail time at all.

12:47.346 --> 12:49.880
Right now there is precious
little evidence to offer

12:49.882 --> 12:52.183
with regard to Brian's
propensity for violence.

12:52.185 --> 12:54.819
Kate didn't talk about it with anyone.

12:54.821 --> 12:57.421
So I need the two of you to drill down

12:57.423 --> 12:59.223
on Brian's romantic life

12:59.225 --> 13:00.791
and find some other victims...

13:00.793 --> 13:03.861
victims willing to testify
on Kate's behalf.

13:03.863 --> 13:06.664
Finding exes online? That's my area.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.438
Can I ask a highly
inappropriate question?

13:09.502 --> 13:11.691
How much of this has to do
with Bull's sister?

13:13.234 --> 13:15.873
How did you know about Bull's sister?

13:15.875 --> 13:17.441
I came here from the FBI.

13:17.443 --> 13:19.076
I wasn't about to change jobs

13:19.078 --> 13:21.712
without knowing everything
I could about my employer.

13:21.714 --> 13:23.147
Wait a minute.

13:23.912 --> 13:25.950
What do you guys know that I don't know?

13:25.952 --> 13:29.086
I got to go. I'm meeting Bull.

13:29.088 --> 13:31.347
And I have a jury pool list

13:31.349 --> 13:33.991
I need to pick up from the county clerk.

13:35.261 --> 13:36.261
Danny?

13:37.063 --> 13:39.230
You have a keyboard. Use it.

13:39.966 --> 13:41.765
Professor Jameson.

13:42.635 --> 13:44.902
Professor Jameson.

13:45.705 --> 13:47.269
You failed me.

13:47.271 --> 13:48.906
I did nothing of the kind, Mr. Palmer.

13:48.908 --> 13:51.308
You failed yourself. All I did was record

13:51.310 --> 13:53.944
and aggregate an average
of your grades in my class.

13:53.946 --> 13:55.212
Grades that you gave me.

13:55.214 --> 13:56.947
Grades that I'm convinced
reflect your biases

13:56.949 --> 13:58.983
far more than they reflect my work.

13:58.985 --> 14:00.885
You're entitled to your
opinion, Mr. Palmer.

14:00.887 --> 14:01.986
It's not my opinion.

14:01.988 --> 14:04.021
I got A's in my other two courses.

14:04.023 --> 14:06.323
Well, I can't speak
to your work in other courses,

14:06.325 --> 14:08.092
but in mine, your work was deficient,

14:08.094 --> 14:09.651
and your grade reflects that.

14:09.653 --> 14:11.262
And by the way, I don't take kindly

14:11.264 --> 14:13.063
to being shanghaied in the hallway.

14:13.065 --> 14:15.332
Well, I tried for a week to get
an appointment with your office,

14:15.334 --> 14:16.467
but no one returned my calls.

14:16.469 --> 14:18.569
I can't imagine why.

14:18.571 --> 14:21.338
Is it just that I work
for a trial scientist?

14:21.340 --> 14:23.107
Or is there more?

14:23.109 --> 14:24.308
What does it matter?

14:24.310 --> 14:26.110
I'll almost certainly
never see you again,

14:26.112 --> 14:27.945
and you'll almost certainly never see me.

14:27.947 --> 14:30.414
I prefer to focus on the positive.

14:30.416 --> 14:33.651
I prefer to focus on that.

14:33.653 --> 14:35.853
Good day, Mr. Palmer.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.323
She told me she left once before.

14:39.325 --> 14:40.524
Headed down to Florida.

14:40.526 --> 14:43.027
Within a week, he found her,
begged her to return,

14:43.029 --> 14:45.462
said that it would be different,
that he had changed.

14:45.464 --> 14:48.799
Apparently, on their whole
car trip back to New York,

14:48.801 --> 14:51.508
he was wonderful...
funny, charming, loving.

14:51.510 --> 14:53.103
And then as soon as they got back

14:53.105 --> 14:55.539
in the apartment,
he broke her collarbone.

14:55.541 --> 14:57.975
Boy, I'd love to get somebody
to testify to that...

14:57.977 --> 14:59.610
a doctor or insurance adjustor...

14:59.612 --> 15:01.211
They don't exist.

15:01.213 --> 15:03.380
He covered his tracks very well.

15:03.382 --> 15:06.317
And because she loved him, she helped.

15:06.319 --> 15:09.386
And having fled once, she realized...

15:09.388 --> 15:11.388
running wouldn't solve anything.

15:11.390 --> 15:13.524
That no matter where she went,

15:13.526 --> 15:16.126
he'd find her and keep hurting her,

15:16.128 --> 15:18.529
and, by extension, hurt the baby.

15:18.531 --> 15:20.097
So...

15:20.099 --> 15:22.199
no witnesses, no hospital records.

15:22.201 --> 15:24.368
How do we get the jury to understand

15:24.370 --> 15:25.703
what her life was like?

15:25.705 --> 15:28.105
For that matter, what kind
of jurors are we looking for?

15:28.107 --> 15:29.707
It's actually easier for me to tell you

15:29.709 --> 15:31.275
who we're not looking for.

15:31.277 --> 15:34.345
We're not looking for people
who are rigid and rule-bound.

15:34.347 --> 15:35.713
They're just gonna follow the law

15:35.715 --> 15:37.982
and send our lady to prison for life.

15:37.984 --> 15:40.818
Forgive me, but how do you
find something like that out?

15:40.820 --> 15:43.587
How do you see if a person
is rigid or rule-bound?

15:43.589 --> 15:45.756
It's all about the questions.

15:45.758 --> 15:48.592
It's Christmas morning, and your
kids are opening up presents.

15:48.594 --> 15:50.794
Lots of toys to put together.

15:50.796 --> 15:53.564
Anybody here actually look
at the instructions?

15:55.501 --> 15:58.469
Your Honor, we'd like to thank
and excuse this juror.

15:58.471 --> 16:00.437
Once we weed out the rule-bound,

16:00.439 --> 16:04.130
we need to identify folks
with strong survival instincts,

16:04.132 --> 16:05.843
people who listen to their intuition

16:05.845 --> 16:08.245
when it comes to dangerous situations

16:08.247 --> 16:11.081
and act on it without fear
of the consequences.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.550
You're on the street,
and you see an older man

16:13.552 --> 16:16.120
with a child who seems
frightened and is pulling away.

16:16.122 --> 16:17.321
What do you do?

16:17.323 --> 16:18.689
What do you mean?

16:18.691 --> 16:20.791
How do you know
it's not the kid's father?

16:20.793 --> 16:22.292
Maybe the kid's being difficult?

16:22.294 --> 16:24.361
I'm not sure there's anything to do.

16:24.363 --> 16:26.663
Your Honor, we move to strike this juror.

16:26.665 --> 16:28.699
We're looking for people who,

16:28.701 --> 16:31.502
when confronted with a
potentially dangerous situation,

16:31.504 --> 16:34.238
don't hesitate, don't ask
if it's the right move...

16:34.240 --> 16:37.007
they just act, like Kate did.

16:37.009 --> 16:38.675
And you, sir, what do you do?

16:38.677 --> 16:40.744
If I'm reading it
as a dangerous situation,

16:40.746 --> 16:42.679
maybe I pretend to be the kid's dad.

16:42.681 --> 16:45.949
Get him away from the guy
so I can find the real parents.

16:45.951 --> 16:49.242
This juror's acceptable to
the defense, Your Honor.

16:54.789 --> 16:56.493
Nice to see you again, Kate.

16:56.495 --> 16:57.861
You're looking better.

16:57.863 --> 17:00.330
I'm guessing they're
weaning you off the sedatives?

17:00.878 --> 17:02.833
I was never on a lot to begin with

17:02.835 --> 17:04.401
because of the baby.

17:05.905 --> 17:08.238
Kate, remember...

17:08.845 --> 17:10.637
you did what you had to do.

17:12.056 --> 17:13.810
You can't let go of that.

17:22.488 --> 17:24.454
A.D.A. Lake.

17:24.457 --> 17:26.723
Dr. Bull.

17:26.724 --> 17:29.893
I have been staring at you
from across the courtroom,

17:29.895 --> 17:32.167
and last night I finally got the chance

17:32.169 --> 17:34.765
to do a little homework and
find out something about you.

17:34.767 --> 17:36.467
A.D.A. Lake,

17:36.469 --> 17:38.836
you've been assigned
to the Domestic Violence unit

17:38.838 --> 17:40.704
for the past 15 years.

17:40.706 --> 17:43.974
You've made a career
out of putting abusers away,

17:43.976 --> 17:46.110
protecting people like my client.

17:46.112 --> 17:47.811
What's wrong with this picture?

17:47.813 --> 17:50.614
Nothing's wrong with
this picture, Dr. Bull.

17:51.584 --> 17:53.317
Sometimes it's harder
than you might think

17:53.319 --> 17:55.600
to tell the abused from the abuser.

18:03.696 --> 18:05.376
Sometimes it's harder
than you might think.

18:17.303 --> 18:18.836
My God.

18:18.838 --> 18:20.404
His whole family is here.

18:20.406 --> 18:21.839
Maybe I made a mistake.

18:21.841 --> 18:24.408
Maybe I should have let
you call my family.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.504
It's okay.

18:26.813 --> 18:29.113
We'll make some calls after court.

18:32.485 --> 18:34.084
It's been said

18:34.086 --> 18:37.421
that every marriage
is its own secret society,

18:37.423 --> 18:40.925
with its own rules and customs
and understandings.

18:40.927 --> 18:43.572
Was abuse part of the Martin marriage?

18:43.574 --> 18:45.830
Yes, it was...

18:45.832 --> 18:47.865
on both sides.

18:47.867 --> 18:49.934
That's not what happened at all.

18:49.936 --> 18:51.869
Were there infidelities?

18:51.871 --> 18:55.342
Yes, as we will prove, on both sides.

18:55.344 --> 18:58.843
That woman certainly can
spin a yarn, can't she?

18:58.845 --> 19:00.811
Officer Levy,

19:00.813 --> 19:02.947
can you please tell us about your visit

19:02.949 --> 19:05.115
to the Martins' home some two years ago

19:05.117 --> 19:06.684
on April 8, 2016?

19:06.686 --> 19:09.119
A noise complaint
was called into the station.

19:09.121 --> 19:10.554
I responded.

19:10.556 --> 19:11.956
And what did you find?

19:11.958 --> 19:14.492
I arrived on scene, where
the defendant and her husband

19:14.494 --> 19:16.026
had clearly been fighting.

19:16.028 --> 19:18.829
Broken pictures,
knickknacks on the floor,

19:18.831 --> 19:21.232
laptop computer looked like it'd
been thrown against the wall.

19:21.234 --> 19:24.635
They had apparently calmed down
prior to my arrival.

19:24.637 --> 19:27.204
And both assured me everything was okay.

19:27.206 --> 19:30.307
While I didn't see any evidence
of physical abuse,

19:30.309 --> 19:33.711
I followed protocol, separated
the defendant and her husband,

19:33.713 --> 19:36.380
urged Mrs. Martin
to speak candidly to me.

19:36.382 --> 19:39.450
It's a tiny apartment...
Brian could hear everything.

19:39.452 --> 19:41.151
And what did she say?

19:41.153 --> 19:42.553
She appeared calm.

19:42.555 --> 19:44.488
Said it was a misunderstanding.

19:44.490 --> 19:46.390
And what happened the next day?

19:46.392 --> 19:49.059
Mr. Martin reached out to me
at the station.

19:49.061 --> 19:51.428
He was interested in filing
a restraining order

19:51.430 --> 19:53.597
against Mrs. Martin.

19:56.002 --> 19:57.897
I thought it couldn't get any worse,

19:57.899 --> 20:00.004
but it actually has.

20:00.973 --> 20:03.361
What restraining order
is he talking about?

20:03.363 --> 20:04.708
I-I have no idea.

20:04.710 --> 20:05.910
Danny here.

20:05.912 --> 20:08.178
Look, no restraining order
was ever actually issued.

20:08.180 --> 20:11.382
And no official report was filed
with the station house.

20:11.384 --> 20:13.484
So are you saying

20:13.486 --> 20:15.486
that the victim was afraid of his wife,

20:15.488 --> 20:17.555
that he felt the need to protect himself?

20:17.557 --> 20:18.789
Objection, Your Honor.

20:18.791 --> 20:21.191
There is no restraining order,

20:21.193 --> 20:22.993
not that we've been able to determine,

20:22.995 --> 20:26.363
and not that the prosecution
offered in discovery.

20:26.365 --> 20:27.498
Can I answer?

20:27.918 --> 20:29.433
Go ahead.

20:29.435 --> 20:31.769
I never said Mr. Martin
actually filed the order.

20:32.590 --> 20:34.405
I only said that he inquired
about the process.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.640
I'm sorry if I wasn't clear about that.

20:36.642 --> 20:38.175
Bearer of bad news here.

20:38.177 --> 20:39.877
The jurors find Officer Levy credible,

20:39.879 --> 20:41.645
and they're buying into the idea

20:41.647 --> 20:43.881
that Brian could have
been afraid of Kate.

20:43.883 --> 20:46.383
It's all feeding into
the prosecution's story.

20:46.385 --> 20:48.385
Officer Levy,

20:48.387 --> 20:50.721
isn't it true that
sometimes people seek out

20:50.723 --> 20:53.624
restraining orders for
duplicitous reasons?

20:54.236 --> 20:57.356
People can and do abuse the system, sure.

20:57.358 --> 21:00.798
And isn't it true that
sometimes abusive partners

21:00.800 --> 21:04.501
will go through the motions of
taking out a restraining order

21:04.503 --> 21:08.706
against their victims to...
create a false narrative

21:08.708 --> 21:10.608
or to neutralize a situation

21:10.610 --> 21:11.814
should they ever be taken to court?

21:11.816 --> 21:12.943
Objection.

21:12.945 --> 21:14.712
That is not a question.

21:14.714 --> 21:16.313
Jury heard it, though.

21:16.315 --> 21:18.315
Ask a question, Mr. Colón.

21:18.317 --> 21:22.820
Are restraining orders ever
sought as a preemptive defense?

21:22.822 --> 21:25.289
So, in case the abuser

21:25.291 --> 21:26.790
ever got caught, they could point

21:26.792 --> 21:29.994
to the order and say that
they were defending themselves.

21:29.996 --> 21:31.562
Sure.

21:31.982 --> 21:33.764
I've heard of that happening.

21:33.766 --> 21:35.010
Not a lot, but...

21:35.012 --> 21:36.696
But you are aware of it, aren't you?

21:38.337 --> 21:39.863
I am.

21:39.864 --> 21:41.330
Thank you, Officer Levy.

21:41.332 --> 21:42.931
No further questions.

21:45.336 --> 21:46.635
Good job, Benny.

21:46.637 --> 21:48.437
We finally picked up a juror.

21:48.439 --> 21:51.273
One down, 11 to go.

21:55.179 --> 21:59.315
A girl's first day in court...
a memory I'll always cherish.

22:00.219 --> 22:02.084
And by the way, I was never unfaithful

22:02.086 --> 22:05.521
to my husband, and I never struck him.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.391
It's easy to get discouraged.

22:09.393 --> 22:12.628
Just remember,
nobody's heard our side yet.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.963
Okay?

22:23.641 --> 22:25.619
So, you and Izzy connect yet?

22:26.944 --> 22:30.446
Nope. I left her three messages.

22:30.448 --> 22:33.682
I guess whatever the
reason for her call was,

22:33.684 --> 22:36.785
she decided it wasn't
so important after all.

22:36.787 --> 22:39.521
Well, no matter what, I'm your guy.

22:40.718 --> 22:42.091
Okay.

22:42.093 --> 22:44.793
I don't remember asking
for a loyalty oath,

22:44.795 --> 22:47.496
but I appreciate the gesture.

22:47.498 --> 22:49.431
You know...

22:49.433 --> 22:52.034
I've never felt less prepared
to do my job

22:52.036 --> 22:53.902
than I did today.

22:53.904 --> 22:56.238
We know precious little about this woman.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.740
Now wait a second.

22:57.742 --> 22:59.274
Dr. Grint... Marian...

22:59.276 --> 23:01.009
from the Survivors'
Justice Project, she...

23:01.011 --> 23:03.545
Marian is not a lawyer.
She's not a detective.

23:03.547 --> 23:07.149
She is a doctor of social work.

23:07.151 --> 23:09.418
She knows what Kate tells her.

23:10.080 --> 23:11.854
I know you trust her.

23:11.856 --> 23:15.002
I know she did everything
she could to help your sister.

23:15.393 --> 23:17.559
I don't know.

23:17.561 --> 23:20.396
Two and a half years
and all these supposed beatings,

23:20.398 --> 23:23.832
not a-a single doctor to testify for us?

23:23.834 --> 23:26.368
Not a single hospital bill?
Not a single friend?

23:26.370 --> 23:28.637
Everybody's working. Everybody's trying.

23:28.639 --> 23:30.639
I know. I know.

23:30.641 --> 23:34.021
Like I said, I'm your guy.

23:34.512 --> 23:36.245
But I need you to know

23:36.247 --> 23:39.014
that I don't have a lot to work with.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.750
And I just don't want to let you down.

23:53.529 --> 23:54.961
I just went through the witness statement

23:54.963 --> 23:57.211
for Alyssa Bell, Brian's
current teaching assistant

23:57.236 --> 23:59.669
and the woman he was having an
affair with when Kate shot him.

23:59.671 --> 24:02.505
According to her, he wasn't violent,

24:02.507 --> 24:05.108
he never struck her, barely
even raised his voice.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.443
Not to pile on,

24:06.445 --> 24:08.345
but I've gone through
all of his social media

24:08.347 --> 24:09.679
and even hacked his e-mail.

24:09.681 --> 24:11.147
The guy was clearly a dog.

24:11.149 --> 24:13.383
I mean, every semester,
he would get a new T.A.,

24:13.385 --> 24:16.953
and by "get," I'm pretty sure
you guys know what I mean.

24:17.599 --> 24:20.826
But I guess I'd be lying
if I said there was even a hint

24:20.828 --> 24:22.235
that anyone was afraid of him

24:22.237 --> 24:24.561
or concerned for their physical safety.

24:24.563 --> 24:27.230
I was able to get a set of medical files

24:27.232 --> 24:29.499
from the walk-in clinic
that she told us she went to

24:29.501 --> 24:31.501
in the fall for her collarbone injury.

24:31.503 --> 24:34.337
The problem is, is the
patient name she used

24:34.339 --> 24:36.406
when she checked in is Jane Doe,

24:36.408 --> 24:39.976
and the doctor who attended
to her no longer works there.

24:41.880 --> 24:45.749
Any other discouraging news
on the investigative front?

24:48.020 --> 24:50.020
Excellent.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.821
We need to talk strategy for tomorrow.

24:51.823 --> 24:54.991
The A.D.A. is gonna call
Brian's sister to the stand.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.327
- Surprise, surprise.
- We need to get ahead of it.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.130
Counteract what we know
is gonna be emotional testimony

25:00.132 --> 25:02.866
without making it look like
we are attacking a woman

25:02.868 --> 25:04.167
who just lost her brother.

25:04.620 --> 25:07.304
You think she knew about Brian's abuse?

25:07.306 --> 25:09.639
Judging from the way she
and everyone else in her family

25:09.641 --> 25:11.508
are glaring at Kate...

25:11.510 --> 25:13.643
I don't think she had a clue.

25:13.645 --> 25:15.145
Can't we use that in our favor?

25:15.147 --> 25:16.546
How do you mean?

25:16.548 --> 25:18.014
She's just like the jurors.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.050
In her mind, there's no abuse.

25:20.052 --> 25:23.320
There's no possible
justification for what Kate did.

25:23.714 --> 25:25.422
But if we can educate her,

25:25.424 --> 25:27.657
show her while she's on the stand

25:28.052 --> 25:29.993
what she didn't know about her brother,

25:29.995 --> 25:31.961
make her see the truth,

25:31.963 --> 25:34.097
the jurors are gonna see it, too.

25:34.099 --> 25:35.699
That's a nice plan, Chunk.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.701
Unfortunately, we have no evidence

25:37.703 --> 25:39.703
to support any of Kate's assertions.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.272
Can't just say things to the woman

25:42.274 --> 25:43.940
without being able to back them up.

25:45.486 --> 25:47.610
Well, I'll get to work
on this list of exes.

25:47.612 --> 25:49.546
Yeah, I'll keep hacking away.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.715
Maybe one of the T.A.s texted a friend

25:51.717 --> 25:54.286
or their mother... something we can use.

26:07.591 --> 26:09.332
You gonna be okay?

26:09.843 --> 26:11.534
No.

26:13.378 --> 26:15.878
They're all correct, you know.

26:17.809 --> 26:20.076
I've done a stupid thing.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.731
Relied on a faulty piece of calculus.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.882
Helping this woman
will not change the fact

26:25.884 --> 26:29.586
that I did nothing to help my own sister.

26:30.489 --> 26:33.056
It's true. You failed at being God.

26:33.058 --> 26:35.892
You are responsible
for everyone and everything.

26:35.894 --> 26:36.993
Just indulge me.

26:36.995 --> 26:39.028
Let me wallow in my own self pity.

26:39.030 --> 26:40.463
You know what, Jason?

26:40.465 --> 26:42.565
Your sister was an adult.

26:42.567 --> 26:44.000
She made her own decisions,

26:44.002 --> 26:46.736
her own choices about who to be with.

26:46.738 --> 26:49.873
And nothing you could have done
would have changed that.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.408
You loved her.

26:52.094 --> 26:54.110
And that is really your only obligation

26:54.112 --> 26:55.806
as a brother.

26:56.348 --> 26:59.082
As for our client,
you can only do what you can do.

26:59.084 --> 27:01.885
She's giving you very little
to work with.

27:03.989 --> 27:05.889
Get some sleep.

27:05.891 --> 27:07.524
Tomorrow is gonna come

27:07.526 --> 27:10.160
whether we're ready for it or not.

27:11.863 --> 27:14.264
And as a brilliant trial scientist

27:14.266 --> 27:18.201
once said to me,
if anyone tells you they know

27:18.203 --> 27:20.703
how a criminal proceeding is gonna end,

27:20.705 --> 27:22.772
they've never been to more than one.

27:23.975 --> 27:26.176
See you in the morning.

27:30.632 --> 27:32.816
My brother had a really good heart.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.250
He loved his wife.

27:34.252 --> 27:36.352
He always spoke so highly of her.

27:36.354 --> 27:39.823
It was like he was
constantly selling her to us.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.591
I was like, "We already bought her."

27:41.593 --> 27:43.126
We love her."

27:43.128 --> 27:44.730
I just...

27:48.067 --> 27:50.500
I don't understand.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.037
Objection, Your Honor.

27:54.039 --> 27:55.438
Relevance?

27:55.440 --> 27:56.973
Take your seat, Mr. Colón.

27:58.120 --> 27:59.194
You may continue.

28:00.145 --> 28:01.211
What do you mean?

28:01.213 --> 28:02.512
What don't you understand?

28:02.514 --> 28:03.980
All of it.

28:03.982 --> 28:07.283
How you can say you love a man
and then kill him.

28:07.753 --> 28:09.185
Can't say you love him

28:09.187 --> 28:11.840
knowing you watched him
bleed out on your bed.

28:13.592 --> 28:16.226
Now, Kate and Brian

28:16.228 --> 28:18.394
were married almost four years.

28:18.396 --> 28:19.996
In all that time,

28:19.998 --> 28:22.599
how often would you say
you visited their apartment?

28:23.811 --> 28:26.236
Actually, I've never been
to their apartment.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.537
Really?

28:27.539 --> 28:31.174
I find that surprising.
He was your brother.

28:31.176 --> 28:33.042
Well, they lived in Brooklyn.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.311
It's hard to get to from where we are.

28:35.313 --> 28:37.914
But they invited you, right?

28:37.916 --> 28:39.516
Tried to get you over?

28:39.518 --> 28:41.684
Actually, I'm not sure that they did.

28:41.686 --> 28:43.920
I mean, he was always talking about

28:43.922 --> 28:45.421
how small the apartment was,

28:45.423 --> 28:48.224
and-and I'm not sure
that they felt comfortable

28:48.226 --> 28:49.459
entertaining there.

28:49.461 --> 28:50.627
We had a house.

28:50.629 --> 28:53.329
But they visited you. Am I correct?

28:53.331 --> 28:55.131
All the time.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.433
Brian loves...

28:57.435 --> 29:00.347
loved my daughters, his nieces.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.773
He and Kate
would play with them for hours.

29:03.775 --> 29:05.608
I always thought when the time was right,

29:05.610 --> 29:08.511
they would have
a beautiful family of their own.

29:08.513 --> 29:09.935
She really had no idea.

29:09.937 --> 29:11.179
No.

29:11.181 --> 29:14.150
What about vacations?
Did you all vacation together?

29:14.611 --> 29:17.487
We'd try, but Brian's schedule
was so unpredictable.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.289
Something was always coming up.

29:19.291 --> 29:22.892
What about the Hawaii vacation
last summer?

29:24.195 --> 29:27.864
They had to cancel.
Um, something at the university.

29:27.866 --> 29:30.099
What if I told you Brian canceled

29:30.101 --> 29:33.670
because he didn't want anyone
seeing Kate in a bathing suit

29:33.672 --> 29:36.806
with all her various bruises
and injuries on display?

29:36.808 --> 29:38.875
Objection. No foundation.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.977
Your Honor, I have a good faith basis

29:40.979 --> 29:42.639
for asking the question.

29:44.649 --> 29:46.849
Answer the question, please.

29:46.851 --> 29:48.918
Well, that's just not true.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.087
I-I don't, I don't understand
what you're saying.

29:51.089 --> 29:54.657
He-he had a meeting come up,
a lecture, something.

29:54.659 --> 29:58.528
What about the hiking trip last fall?

29:58.530 --> 30:01.798
What if I told you that Brian
fractured Kate's clavicle

30:01.800 --> 30:03.333
just two days before the trip?

30:03.335 --> 30:05.301
Objection. Facts not in evidence.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.070
Your Honor, I'd like to submit

30:07.072 --> 30:11.641
the following Chelsea West
Walk-In Clinic records

30:12.169 --> 30:13.910
under the name Jane Doe,

30:13.912 --> 30:17.614
which our client was just able
to provide us with this morning.

30:17.616 --> 30:20.950
I've got medical records, X-rays.

30:20.952 --> 30:22.685
May I please show the witness?

30:22.687 --> 30:25.855
I'll allow it,
subject to future verification.

30:32.530 --> 30:34.464
Well, that's fine. I...

30:34.466 --> 30:36.766
But I don't know
what I'm looking at here.

30:36.768 --> 30:38.534
It's what your brother did to his wife.

30:38.536 --> 30:41.771
Objection. No one has
authenticated those images.

30:41.773 --> 30:44.607
My apologies, Your Honor.
I'm getting ahead of myself.

30:44.609 --> 30:48.478
Now, let's just talk about...
the long sleeves in the summer.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.913
The fact that you never
met Kate's family.

30:50.915 --> 30:52.849
The fact that Kate never spoke

30:52.851 --> 30:55.151
for herself when Brian was there...

30:55.153 --> 30:56.363
and he was always there.

30:56.365 --> 30:59.925
Perhaps 'cause he was afraid
of what she might say.

31:00.725 --> 31:02.425
What she'd tell you.

31:02.427 --> 31:04.661
What she'd show you.

31:04.663 --> 31:05.995
Objection, Your Honor.

31:05.997 --> 31:09.265
They were a beautiful couple.
He adored her.

31:09.267 --> 31:11.300
Your Honor, those are not questions.

31:11.895 --> 31:14.804
Counselor, ask the witness a question

31:14.806 --> 31:16.673
and give her a chance to answer.

31:16.675 --> 31:19.442
Actually, I have no
further questions, Your Honor.

31:19.444 --> 31:22.912
Wow, Bull. You and Benny
just doubled our green jurors.

31:22.914 --> 31:25.314
Meaning we have two jurors out of 12.

31:25.316 --> 31:27.517
We're like a runaway train.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.085
So, in all your time together,

31:29.087 --> 31:31.081
you never saw a propensity to violence?

31:31.956 --> 31:35.658
He never lost his temper?
Um, never made you feel afraid?

31:37.529 --> 31:39.729
Okay. Well, um, I appreciate

31:39.731 --> 31:41.731
you taking the time to speak with me.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.534
Enjoy your new home. Enjoy Florida.

31:44.536 --> 31:47.670
I found one more, and she's local.

31:47.672 --> 31:49.138
Hailee Sparks.

31:49.140 --> 31:51.641
She dropped out of the grad
program a couple years ago,

31:51.643 --> 31:53.276
transferred to a different school.

31:53.278 --> 31:55.244
Cross your fingers.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.480
Maybe he scared her away.

31:59.317 --> 32:01.317
We made some progress today.

32:01.319 --> 32:03.196
I know. I felt it.

32:03.955 --> 32:06.366
What's our next move?

32:07.025 --> 32:09.258
You're our next move.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.162
It's time for us to tell our story,

32:13.164 --> 32:15.598
and we have no one to tell it but you.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.067
But isn't that a risky thing to do?

32:18.069 --> 32:19.836
I've always read that you try

32:19.838 --> 32:22.371
to never put an accused murderer
on the stand.

32:22.373 --> 32:23.372
That's true.

32:23.374 --> 32:25.108
But we really have no choice.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.442
My best guess is

32:26.444 --> 32:28.344
we have two jurors on our side.

32:28.346 --> 32:30.680
If no one in the jury room

32:30.682 --> 32:33.393
is able to-to sway them
during deliberations...

32:34.753 --> 32:37.520
best case is you're looking
at a hung jury and a mistrial.

32:37.522 --> 32:39.822
With ten jurors ready to convict,

32:39.824 --> 32:41.691
the district attorney's office is

32:41.693 --> 32:43.926
definitely going to move to retry,

32:43.928 --> 32:47.530
which means you spend a year
in prison... pregnant...

32:48.200 --> 32:49.899
having watched your baby

32:49.901 --> 32:52.335
taken from you and put into foster care.

32:55.582 --> 32:57.540
You testifying is the best chance we have

32:57.542 --> 32:58.835
to change some minds.

32:59.778 --> 33:01.546
I think we have to take it.

33:11.849 --> 33:14.150
Did you know your husband Brian
was having an affair?

33:15.410 --> 33:17.253
I assumed he was having an affair.

33:17.979 --> 33:20.432
I realized shortly after
our first anniversary

33:20.457 --> 33:23.291
that he was always having affairs.

33:23.293 --> 33:25.493
Affairs were his oxygen.

33:25.495 --> 33:28.363
I think they made him feel better

33:28.365 --> 33:30.298
about just being
the most popular professor,

33:30.300 --> 33:32.133
instead of the acclaimed novelist,

33:32.135 --> 33:34.202
which is really
what he always wanted to be.

33:34.204 --> 33:36.771
In her opening statement,
the A.D.A. mentioned

33:36.773 --> 33:40.837
that you were also having
extramarital affairs.

33:40.839 --> 33:42.035
Is that true?

33:42.037 --> 33:45.586
Not only have I never
cheated on my husband,

33:45.587 --> 33:48.956
my husband is actually the
only man I've ever been with.

33:49.344 --> 33:53.660
I met him when I was 19,
and I was instantly besotted.

33:54.141 --> 33:55.929
I love that word.

33:55.931 --> 33:57.965
Brian taught me that word.

33:57.967 --> 34:00.367
So let me ask you
the million-dollar question.

34:00.897 --> 34:03.503
If you knew your husband
was having an affair,

34:03.505 --> 34:08.041
if he beat you, as you claim,
why not leave?

34:08.530 --> 34:10.489
Because I loved him.

34:11.313 --> 34:14.614
And... maybe I...

34:14.616 --> 34:17.751
I hated me a little bit.

34:18.206 --> 34:21.554
And also, because he'd always
sense when it was too much,

34:21.556 --> 34:23.223
and he'd tell me he was sorry,

34:23.225 --> 34:26.193
that he was putting a stop
to it, and I believed him.

34:27.196 --> 34:28.762
Our ten to two just

34:28.764 --> 34:30.235
became nine to three.

34:30.260 --> 34:33.000
But isn't it true that you tried
to leave once before?

34:33.661 --> 34:36.570
Yes. I left once.

34:36.572 --> 34:39.206
Why? What happened between you

34:39.208 --> 34:41.274
that finally made you willing to leave?

34:41.275 --> 34:44.311
He was drunk. He came home.

34:45.380 --> 34:47.277
Told me I was boring.

34:48.195 --> 34:51.685
He told me I was a boring person,

34:51.687 --> 34:53.366
a boring woman,

34:54.089 --> 34:56.161
and most of all...

34:57.162 --> 34:59.026
a boring writer.

34:59.831 --> 35:02.396
And that was the straw
that broke the camel's back?

35:04.099 --> 35:05.504
No.

35:06.035 --> 35:08.735
He, punched me in the vagina.

35:09.299 --> 35:11.004
Objection.

35:11.006 --> 35:12.939
Your Honor, this woman, this murderer

35:12.941 --> 35:14.808
is telling stories about a dead man

35:14.810 --> 35:16.549
that no one can corroborate.

35:16.551 --> 35:17.978
Sit down, please.

35:17.980 --> 35:19.846
You'll have your chance to cross-examine.

35:20.685 --> 35:22.649
Continue, Mr. Colón.

35:24.064 --> 35:25.385
What happened?

35:26.691 --> 35:28.722
Um... he... found me,

35:28.724 --> 35:31.725
drove me home, promised to change.

35:32.155 --> 35:33.727
Broke my collarbone.

35:34.908 --> 35:36.430
Can you tell the jury

35:36.432 --> 35:39.766
what compelled you
to leave this last time?

35:42.404 --> 35:44.604
A hundred things.

35:44.606 --> 35:47.174
A million things.

35:47.754 --> 35:51.745
And then I... I found out that
I was eight weeks pregnant.

35:53.849 --> 35:55.549
No further questions, Your Honor.

35:55.551 --> 35:58.885
I'm staring at eight red and four green.

36:00.889 --> 36:02.622
It's not good enough.

36:03.603 --> 36:05.859
I know you feel I sent
you out there half-naked,

36:05.861 --> 36:08.728
but for what it's worth, you
acquitted yourself beautifully.

36:10.232 --> 36:11.765
She acquitted herself beautifully.

36:11.767 --> 36:13.834
I only wish it were enough.

36:13.836 --> 36:15.368
Yeah, I know what you mean.

36:15.370 --> 36:17.104
If only there were one other person,

36:17.106 --> 36:18.505
someone who would testify

36:18.507 --> 36:20.173
that this guy was genuinely dangerous.

36:20.579 --> 36:23.009
Actually, there is.

36:23.011 --> 36:25.946
Two years ago, I T.A.'d his class.

36:25.948 --> 36:29.182
Helped with lectures, small
groups, that sort of thing.

36:29.184 --> 36:33.820
He was charming, flirty...
aggressively so.

36:33.822 --> 36:37.524
I knew he was married,
I knew it was wrong,

36:37.526 --> 36:40.494
but I started sleeping with him anyway.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.129
I told myself

36:42.131 --> 36:43.964
I didn't really have a choice.

36:43.966 --> 36:46.900
He was on the faculty board
in charge of my scholarship,

36:46.902 --> 36:48.568
grading my thesis.

36:48.570 --> 36:51.146
It was easier to just go along with it.

36:52.141 --> 36:55.408
I wish I had been smarter, stronger.

36:55.410 --> 36:57.210
Objection. Relevance?

36:57.212 --> 37:00.013
Overruled. Continue, please.

37:00.015 --> 37:03.316
Did you ever have occasion
to meet with Mrs. Martin

37:03.318 --> 37:05.585
during your relationship
with her husband?

37:05.587 --> 37:08.054
I did. Sort of.

37:08.877 --> 37:11.191
There was this one night. It was winter.

37:11.193 --> 37:14.094
I went back to the office late,
which I never did.

37:14.096 --> 37:16.129
I had left my laptop there.

37:16.718 --> 37:18.798
Anyway, there's an outer office

37:18.800 --> 37:22.135
where I worked and an inner
office where Brian worked.

37:22.137 --> 37:26.206
And as I unlocked the front
door, I could hear him in there.

37:26.208 --> 37:28.608
And I could hear
a woman's voice, as well.

37:28.610 --> 37:31.778
So, anyway, I didn't flip on the light,

37:31.780 --> 37:33.380
didn't do anything.

37:33.382 --> 37:35.236
Just stood there in the doorway.

37:35.851 --> 37:38.823
They were yelling, fighting.

37:39.688 --> 37:43.590
Brian had this tone.
I had never heard it before.

37:43.592 --> 37:46.860
It was... it was so vicious.

37:46.862 --> 37:48.762
He was calling her names,

37:48.764 --> 37:52.879
calling her "stupid,"
calling her his "bitch wife."

37:53.402 --> 37:55.869
And then the woman was crying,

37:55.871 --> 37:58.805
telling him she was going
to go to the police.

37:58.807 --> 38:01.341
And then he laughed, and then...

38:01.343 --> 38:03.348
there was this sound.

38:03.845 --> 38:06.913
I didn't know if he punched her
or if he kicked her,

38:06.915 --> 38:09.316
but you could hear him make contact,

38:09.318 --> 38:10.984
and you could hear her moan.

38:11.690 --> 38:12.953
And then I heard him

38:12.955 --> 38:15.956
tell her that if she ever went
to the police, he'd kill her.

38:15.958 --> 38:17.557
And what did you do?

38:18.154 --> 38:19.406
God.

38:20.281 --> 38:21.991
I did nothing.

38:22.431 --> 38:24.364
I was just kind of frozen.

38:24.366 --> 38:25.999
And then, like, a second later,

38:26.001 --> 38:28.335
the inner door office opens,
and it's Brian,

38:28.337 --> 38:29.936
and he sees me standing there,

38:29.938 --> 38:32.639
and I must have just had
this look on my face.

38:32.641 --> 38:34.074
Why? What did he do?

38:34.838 --> 38:38.545
He just blew by me, just disappeared,

38:38.547 --> 38:41.114
through the door, down the hall,
just left the building.

38:41.116 --> 38:43.950
And what did you do?

38:44.681 --> 38:48.622
Once I knew he was gone, I called out.

38:48.624 --> 38:51.491
I didn't leave the doorway,
but I called out.

38:52.147 --> 38:54.861
I asked if whoever
was in there was all right,

38:54.863 --> 38:57.364
and she said she was,

38:57.366 --> 38:59.933
so I grabbed my laptop and I left.

39:00.989 --> 39:03.436
Next morning, I withdrew from school.

39:03.438 --> 39:05.639
Never saw Brian again.

39:06.619 --> 39:09.175
And I'm so, so sorry.

39:21.134 --> 39:23.089
What you feeling, boss?

39:23.091 --> 39:25.592
Nine days.

39:25.594 --> 39:29.863
We certainly know they thought
about it, struggled with it.

39:31.833 --> 39:33.700
That's all we know.

39:34.314 --> 39:35.735
Why did I plead with that judge

39:35.737 --> 39:38.538
to disallow manslaughter
or any other lesser charge?

39:38.540 --> 39:41.174
What possessed me
to go for all or nothing?

39:41.176 --> 39:44.344
I should have left those jurors
a door to walk through.

39:46.181 --> 39:47.664
Okay.

39:47.666 --> 39:50.950
But I think you need to pull
yourself together, Bull.

39:50.952 --> 39:53.333
That girl is depending on you.

39:54.523 --> 39:56.002
I know.

39:56.625 --> 39:58.254
I know you know.

40:00.762 --> 40:03.663
Good afternoon, Dr. Bull, Mr. Colón,

40:03.665 --> 40:04.731
Dr. Grint.

40:07.536 --> 40:10.737
I'm sorry. I... I can't stop shaking.

40:11.351 --> 40:13.039
Here.

40:15.510 --> 40:17.565
Hold on to me.

40:21.319 --> 40:22.782
That's better, isn't it?

40:24.399 --> 40:26.867
Now you just hang on and
don't let go, 'cause I'm here.

40:28.785 --> 40:30.523
This thing's gonna go one of two ways.

40:32.594 --> 40:34.527
Either it's all been one big bad dream

40:34.529 --> 40:36.329
and you're about to become a free woman,

40:36.331 --> 40:39.833
in which case
I'm gonna take you for a walk,

40:39.835 --> 40:43.466
because walking is very good
for pregnant women, you know.

40:44.506 --> 40:46.344
My sister told me that.

40:48.810 --> 40:50.328
Or...

40:51.891 --> 40:56.316
if, for some reason, things
don't... go our way in there...

40:58.153 --> 41:00.620
well, you're not rid of me, 'cause...

41:01.317 --> 41:02.889
we're just gonna appeal
the living daylights

41:02.891 --> 41:04.190
out of this thing.

41:04.192 --> 41:06.593
I mean, you are gonna be so sick of me.

41:06.595 --> 41:08.575
Not possible.

41:09.331 --> 41:11.364
You'll see.

41:11.366 --> 41:13.266
I'm very unusual.

41:13.268 --> 41:15.999
I'm actually an acquired dislike.

41:32.421 --> 41:35.655
We the jury find the defendant,

41:35.657 --> 41:37.562
Kate Martin...

41:38.260 --> 41:41.428
not guilty of murder in the first degree.

41:47.427 --> 41:48.970
Thank you for your service.

41:48.972 --> 41:52.005
This court is adjourned.

42:09.469 --> 42:10.723
Good call on

42:10.725 --> 42:12.492
the all-or-nothing strategy.

42:12.494 --> 42:16.162
Hey, when you've been doing this
as long as I have...

42:18.853 --> 42:21.314
And you should reach out to your family.

42:21.316 --> 42:25.572
You're gonna need them,
now more than ever.

42:34.483 --> 42:37.417
It's okay. Let him go.
