00:30.562 --> 00:34.571
Translation: R1y!

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
1000 to 1

00:39.100 --> 00:41.627
Based on a true story

01:21.202 --> 01:26.129
What are the odds?
Our life is a part of a big puzzle?

01:26.130 --> 01:33.057
Is everybody a little bit waiting
until someone makes us a whole?

01:33.058 --> 01:38.058
Is life a series of
coincidences or is there more?

01:58.171 --> 02:00.171
Hey, Cory.

02:39.523 --> 02:42.120
You'd better quieter
doing, big guy.

02:42.121 --> 02:44.502
You're breathing pretty heavy,
you get older and older.

02:44.503 --> 02:50.997
- I'll show you even old. Come on.
- I'll make it this time easier.

02:50.998 --> 02:54.893
- That was no mistake.
- Stop block.

02:54.894 --> 02:57.492
Blocks? No, it was not a mistake.

02:57.493 --> 02:59.656
every game you call it.

02:59.657 --> 03:04.420
You know what blocks?
Each turnovers call you wrong game.

03:04.421 --> 03:07.421
So what, you do not understand.

03:13.080 --> 03:17.410
- My game! Again?
- No. I have to learn.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Learning takes place here.
-I Have to learn.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.935
- Teacher present?
- Exactly, I see you.

03:26.936 --> 03:29.533
Coach.
-Pops.

03:29.534 --> 03:33.863
Hey, Coach.
Hey.

03:33.864 --> 03:37.976
Beautiful, Weissman! Relax,
loose shoulders.

03:37.977 --> 03:42.090
Once throw?

03:42.091 --> 03:45.091
It's all in the knees.

03:48.153 --> 03:51.183
What can I say?
those who can not go to the coach.

03:51.184 --> 03:56.163
You're doing good boy. Good shot
and defense over the floor.

03:56.164 --> 03:59.164
I disagree with you will not play
I say you do not observe.

03:59.300 --> 04:02.800
There are three guests who will be graduating this year.
If you go

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
as you play now you have chance next
season start as <i> point guard </ i>.</i>

04:07.206 --> 04:09.669
Coach, I do not want anything
I've earned yourself.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.500
You have a thousand points in your school career.
I think you've earned it all.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.500
Bend your knees.

04:39.896 --> 04:43.143
- How is he, David?
- Cory, good to see you.

04:43.144 --> 04:46.144
- I've heard you do great things.
- I try anyway.

04:53.536 --> 04:59.597
Two pieces Margherita
the sweetest girl in the school.

04:59.598 --> 05:02.627
Thank you, Cory. Very kind.
You walked through that whole party,

05:02.628 --> 05:06.741
- For me, you're the best boyfriend ever.
- Sorry. I'm just...

05:06.742 --> 05:09.339
... Nervous for the presentation.

05:09.340 --> 05:13.020
Fate or free will?
"Romeo and Juliet".

05:13.021 --> 05:17.783
Seven to nine pages Monday
and I can not even get around.

05:17.784 --> 05:21.247
If you have ideas ...

05:21.248 --> 05:28.824
- Romeo is the man, right?
- Cute.

05:28.825 --> 05:36.185
Maybe this
situation both ways.

05:36.186 --> 05:39.217
As this year's team, with me.

05:39.218 --> 05:43.113
- You know I'm a competitive person?
- A little.

05:43.114 --> 05:49.825
That final year student, on my
start position. He's really good.

05:49.826 --> 05:53.722
That is to say, that I for the first time
in my life, sitting on the couch.

05:53.723 --> 05:58.917
I can through this fateful
event in the pit to sit down,

05:58.918 --> 06:01.516
if I can use this motivation
to just work harder.

06:01.617 --> 06:06.367
I know nothing about Romeo and Juliet,
but what I do know is ...

06:06.496 --> 06:12.124
that's the way how you respond to something
is as important as what happens to you.

06:12.125 --> 06:18.186
Wow. Cory which was
actually very helpful.

06:18.187 --> 06:21.187
Thank you.

06:24.466 --> 06:26.846
That was sweet.

06:26.847 --> 06:32.258
- My turn. I'm looking for more.
- Sorry.

06:32.259 --> 06:37.259
- No, it's nothing.
- With extra cheese? Or pepperoni.

06:52.610 --> 06:56.289
The idea of â€‹â€‹an expanding universe
gives you the idea

06:56.290 --> 07:00.403
that galaxies farther out
each float in space.

07:00.404 --> 07:04.301
However, now it is believed that the
galaxies do not move

07:04.302 --> 07:08.414
But that space there between
is increasing.

07:08.415 --> 07:13.177
I see the facial expressions that
some of you are confused completely.

07:13.178 --> 07:18.178
Our time is over. Do not be
worried, Thursday becomes clear.

07:51.931 --> 07:56.044
Good. Good.

07:56.045 --> 08:00.590
Good. Come on.

08:02.591 --> 08:06.734
Do you want your tutu now or later? Lifting!

08:07.735 --> 08:12.064
You would have me in a skirt
want to see is not.

08:12.665 --> 08:14.665
- Good job.
- Thank you.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.694
What's next?

08:17.695 --> 08:22.890
You and Ally have plans?
We thought to go to Kristin tonight.

08:22.891 --> 08:28.518
Perhaps following some bench press.

08:28.519 --> 08:33.931
What do you think?

08:33.932 --> 08:36.529
- Of what?
- From tonight, crazy.

08:36.530 --> 08:38.909
Sorry. I think I
was daydreaming.

08:38.910 --> 08:41.508
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

08:41.509 --> 08:46.055
- Sure.
- I'm starting this afternoon, headache.

08:46.056 --> 08:51.056
- Why do you ask Kathy not an aspirin.
- No it's OK.

09:01.211 --> 09:03.807
- Hey, I think this weight is taped.
- What?

09:03.808 --> 09:07.055
This weight seems stuck stuck.

09:07.155 --> 09:09.155
What are you talking about?

09:15.434 --> 09:17.434
You do not look so good, dude.

09:18.097 --> 09:22.097
It's like someone me
with knives sticking in my head.

09:26.974 --> 09:30.870
We're going to get some water.

09:30.871 --> 09:35.222
- Is everything alright?
- Yeah, it's good, I ...

09:52.521 --> 10:00.097
- What's wrong with me, Pops?
- I do not know. Let's go to Katie.

10:00.098 --> 10:02.912
Lean on Me.

10:02.913 --> 10:05.726
I got you.

10:05.727 --> 10:09.840
We are almost there.
Coach! Katie!

10:09.841 --> 10:13.520
- What happened?
- I do not know. We were on the train.

10:13.521 --> 10:18.284
Put him on the bench.
Cory, can you tell me what's wrong?

10:18.285 --> 10:21.314
Head hurts.

10:21.315 --> 10:26.943
Can you squeeze my hand, Cory?

10:26.944 --> 10:29.975
Okay now again
try it with your left hand.

10:29.976 --> 10:35.387
Can you laugh at me?

10:35.388 --> 10:42.747
- Oh my.
- Stay down. Everything will be fine.

10:42.748 --> 10:45.779
This is from George Petrie
Gettysburg College.

10:45.780 --> 10:49.026
We have an ambulance
required at the gym.

10:49.027 --> 10:52.274
- I think a student has a stroke.
- What?

10:52.275 --> 10:55.738
- His name is Cory Weissman.
- Can you tell me what day it is?

10:55.739 --> 10:58.336
The left side does not respond.

11:07.863 --> 11:11.563
- It's good, right?
- You did well.

11:19.338 --> 11:21.338
What about his parents?

11:27.564 --> 11:31.027
Bye dear. I'm jogging
and at half past five I have a client.

11:31.028 --> 11:34.275
Mrs. Weissman, Brendan here.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.776
Hey, Pops. Where is Cory?

11:39.688 --> 11:41.688
Is everything okay?

11:45.533 --> 11:50.533
We where the weightlifting
in the gym and ...

12:00.039 --> 12:04.801
Hi, Mrs. Weissmann, Katie Whaley here.
I'm assistant sports coach at Gettysburg.

12:04.802 --> 12:09.802
We do not know with certainty. But it looks
forward Cory had a stroke.

12:14.111 --> 12:16.276
Where is he?

12:16.277 --> 12:19.277
The ambulance just left
Hershey to the hospital.

12:23.638 --> 12:25.638
FIRST AID

12:31.865 --> 12:35.065
- Thank you for coming coach.
- What's going on, we see him?

12:35.165 --> 12:39.165
He's room 206.
I'll get the doctor.

12:53.081 --> 12:57.081
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, Mom.

13:01.525 --> 13:04.525
Sorry.

13:11.916 --> 13:18.194
It is subarachnoid hematoma caused by
an arterio-venous malformation in Cory's brains.

13:18.195 --> 13:21.225
AVM, which is torn.

13:21.226 --> 13:23.390
We have a medical background.

13:23.391 --> 13:29.669
The large amount of blood from
the bleeding is the cause of the stroke.

13:29.670 --> 13:32.050
And unfortunately this is still bleeding.

13:32.051 --> 13:35.947
And you can not stop what
means that the brains are swollen.

13:35.948 --> 13:39.194
We can not do anything until the
is stabilized by itself.

13:39.195 --> 13:43.308
And if it does not by itself
stabilizes, then what?

13:43.309 --> 13:46.339
The good news is that he is young
and has an excellent condition.

13:46.340 --> 13:51.700
That's exactly what I tell my patients,
if their children have problems.

13:53.701 --> 13:56.701
You have to be honest.

13:58.031 --> 14:02.331
at present we can not
be sure that he survives the night.

14:31.805 --> 14:36.350
Hey.
Hey.

14:36.351 --> 14:39.351
- What time is it?
- It is late.

14:41.980 --> 14:47.980
They have prepared a room,
where we can get some sleep.

14:48.692 --> 14:50.805
He is in good hands.

14:52.806 --> 14:58.433
I can see that he fights,
but he can not do this alone.

14:58.434 --> 15:00.434
He needs us.

15:02.981 --> 15:06.228
All I have to sit here 24 hours a day
and a whole week of sleep.

15:06.229 --> 15:09.229
I am here when he wakes up.

15:13.806 --> 15:18.806
Whatever happens, we stand
not allow this beats Cory.

15:21.383 --> 15:23.383
What the...?

15:24.847 --> 15:26.847
Come on!

15:28.311 --> 15:30.811
What is happening?

15:32.208 --> 15:35.238
Causing bleeding
more pressure on the brains.

15:35.239 --> 15:38.269
- We should give Mannitol.
- What is Mannitol?

15:38.270 --> 15:40.867
If he does not stabilize
we have to operate on him.

15:40.868 --> 15:45.197
- What about swelling?
- Sorry, you'll have to wait outside.

15:45.198 --> 15:48.698
Let's go. Give them some space
to work. Come on.

16:00.569 --> 16:05.569
We do not operate. The danger
is not over, but the situation is better.

16:17.024 --> 16:20.024
Cory. Can you hear me?

16:23.085 --> 16:27.847
Vital signs look good.
We just have to wait and see.

16:27.848 --> 16:30.043
We just have to wait and see.

16:33.044 --> 16:35.044
Can you tell us where you are?

16:54.261 --> 16:56.641
Hey, boy.
Hey.

16:56.642 --> 16:59.890
- Another change?
- He's still unconscious.

16:59.891 --> 17:01.891
Still no response.

17:07.035 --> 17:09.234
Hey, big brother here.

17:12.013 --> 17:14.013
What's up, dude?

17:21.757 --> 17:23.757
Where have you been?

17:26.952 --> 17:29.152
I brought lunch for Mom and Dad.

17:31.932 --> 17:34.932
Do you have a chocolate milkshake
bring me?

17:46.221 --> 17:49.901
- What day is it?
- Monday.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.902
- What is the name of your brother?
- Jeremy.

17:55.097 --> 17:57.911
Where are you going to study?

17:57.912 --> 17:59.912
Harvard.

18:02.241 --> 18:04.241
Stanford.

18:05.922 --> 18:07.922
Gettysburg?

18:08.520 --> 18:11.551
The whole team has
Signatures put.

18:11.552 --> 18:15.231
Pops and Coach
have brought it.

18:15.232 --> 18:18.911
You're in luck, so much
have friends who care about you.

18:18.912 --> 18:21.726
Do I really have to such rehabilitation?

18:21.727 --> 18:24.108
You have to go a long way, boy.

18:24.109 --> 18:29.109
- Can not I just practice at home?
- It's only a month, more or less.

18:29.953 --> 18:32.984
Depends on how fast you recovered.

18:32.985 --> 18:38.613
Can you call the nurse for me?

18:38.614 --> 18:42.510
Oh ... I'll do it.

18:42.511 --> 18:46.407
- What do you mean?
- I'll help.

18:46.408 --> 18:51.386
I helped grandpa always.
Shift your weight. To the left.

18:51.387 --> 18:55.283
- To the left?
- The other left.

18:55.284 --> 18:59.614
- Sure, what you do?
- I've got it. Let me...

18:59.615 --> 19:01.995
Sorry. Are you okay?

19:01.996 --> 19:05.207
You let me fall
the side that feels pain.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
- What happened?
- Way to treat a stroke patient is not, anyway.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.300
Yep.

19:22.780 --> 19:24.780
Thank you.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.813
What a fun.

19:38.367 --> 19:41.867
How are you? Does it hurt?

19:43.347 --> 19:49.347
From time to time. Sometimes it seems like I
a half-dead body dragging.

19:58.935 --> 20:02.614
Not ... not look at me.

20:02.615 --> 20:06.377
- What?
- As if you feel sorry for me.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
- I feel sorry for you.
- Yes, but I'm going to beat this.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.500
Clear? Come here.

20:29.894 --> 20:33.794
That felt good.
At the right.

20:36.822 --> 20:40.422
North Wright is one of the best
rehabilitation of the country.

20:40.719 --> 20:44.182
We have advanced treatment methods,
care of patients with spinal cord injuries,

20:44.183 --> 20:46.383
head injuries and strokes.

20:48.513 --> 20:52.873
In the beginning, it's all what
overwhelming but you get used to it quickly.

20:55.874 --> 20:58.874
Let's take a look at your room.

21:01.503 --> 21:03.667
We make you wake up at 7:00 for breakfast.

21:03.668 --> 21:06.915
Then you have six times a day therapy.

21:06.916 --> 21:10.162
- So we start tomorrow?
- What do you mean "we"?

21:10.163 --> 21:13.409
- I studied physiotherapy.
- Maybe, but ...

21:13.410 --> 21:16.657
With all due respect, he might
your patient, but he is my son.

21:16.658 --> 21:21.204
I motivated him 19 years
am not going to stop now.

21:21.205 --> 21:24.666
- By speaking no sense.
- Yes, believe us.

21:25.967 --> 21:29.431
This is a good center.
They will help us to overcome this.

21:29.432 --> 21:31.932
I'm exhausted.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
and I have some appointments in the morning, so ...

21:36.000 --> 21:39.029
I'll be. There is still the
some things that I want to read.

21:39.090 --> 21:41.090
Mother Bear.

21:41.200 --> 21:45.047
Okay. I'm leaving early in the morning.
I'll see you tomorrow afternoon.

21:45.152 --> 21:48.152
I love you.
Do not stay up late.

22:29.834 --> 22:33.514
- Come here. Show Dad how.
- Okay, one more time.

22:33.515 --> 22:37.710
Good. Go to the Basket.
Shoot!

22:37.711 --> 22:40.824
- Scorer!
- Yes, Cory!

22:47.155 --> 22:51.050
Hands wide.
Nice attitude, Cory.

22:51.051 --> 22:54.731
Good. Block me.

22:54.732 --> 22:57.329
- In your face.
- Yes, son.

22:57.330 --> 22:59.958
That's my boy.

23:02.759 --> 23:05.139
Push and pull back.

23:05.140 --> 23:08.171
Pushing. Good.

23:08.172 --> 23:11.172
You use your right arm,
but teaches the left arm.

23:17.697 --> 23:21.810
This is the hardest,
thing I ever had to do.

23:21.811 --> 23:25.707
Just like my brains and body
speak two different languages.

23:25.708 --> 23:28.522
Good.

23:28.523 --> 23:32.023
I have to learn everything all over again.

23:47.791 --> 23:51.791
The hardest thing is my mind
clearly keeping all those medications.

23:54.502 --> 23:57.316
Shift your weight
to your left foot.

23:57.317 --> 24:00.917
But I will do everything required,
to play basketball again.

24:03.278 --> 24:06.978
Although it sometimes seems
still going to last very long.

24:24.728 --> 24:27.975
That's math for kindergarten.

24:27.976 --> 24:29.976
Can you solve it?

24:35.121 --> 24:37.934
This is just crazy.

24:37.935 --> 24:42.435
- Maybe if you try to concentrate ...
- Maybe you should just do it.

24:45.296 --> 24:48.996
Sorry.

24:51.574 --> 24:54.574
I will do it.
It works well, thank you.

25:07.812 --> 25:10.812
I hate it that you have to see me like this.

25:10.813 --> 25:12.766
Cory

25:12.791 --> 25:17.791
- I do not care.
- I do not even know what I'm doing here.

25:21.668 --> 25:26.012
I do not believe in coincidence.
Everything happens for a reason.

25:27.513 --> 25:32.574
What is the reason for that?

25:33.575 --> 25:38.787
It just happened.
There is no reason.

25:38.988 --> 25:43.282
You just ... bad luck.

25:45.483 --> 25:47.483
Weight on the left.

25:51.012 --> 25:54.012
Continue, continue to the end.

25:56.424 --> 25:59.021
- Come on, you can do this.
- I do my best, Mom.

25:59.022 --> 26:02.022
Only sometimes seems all this ...

26:04.002 --> 26:06.002
I need a break.

26:31.713 --> 26:35.393
Are you all right, Cory?
What is going on?

26:35.394 --> 26:38.156
To the left, come on, put pressure.

26:40.157 --> 26:44.053
Upright. And right.

26:44.054 --> 26:46.868
- How are you?
- Well okay,

26:46.869 --> 26:48.898
but I think we
against a wall walk.

26:48.999 --> 26:52.245
Okay, in the wheelchair,
we go outside.

26:53.146 --> 26:56.846
- What do you mean?
- Time for a little alternative therapy.

27:01.779 --> 27:03.942
Mom, what are you doing?
This is stupid.

27:04.088 --> 27:06.685
Since you could crawl want
you throw a basketball.

27:06.686 --> 27:09.717
I do not want to throw,
because I can not.

27:09.718 --> 27:12.964
- You do not know.
- Look, I really appreciate this.

27:12.965 --> 27:16.212
But, you can take me back to
bring the hospital?

27:16.213 --> 27:19.242
I never doubt your mother.

27:19.243 --> 27:22.221
If you make it you get
me a chocolate milkshake.

27:25.522 --> 27:27.501
I'm here now anyway.

27:30.502 --> 27:32.502
Let's try it.

27:39.594 --> 27:41.594
- Do you have him?
- Yes.

27:44.790 --> 27:45.977
You can do it.

28:11.637 --> 28:14.780
- He's still there.
- Double or nothing?

28:18.781 --> 28:22.676
- Good shot.
- Camera running?

28:22.677 --> 28:26.306
Let's see how you do it,
when someone stands in the way.

28:28.307 --> 28:32.307
- Beautiful.
- Aim and follow.

28:32.637 --> 28:34.317
Bend your knees.

28:35.018 --> 28:37.318
- There right.
- All right!

28:40.214 --> 28:41.514
- This is therapy.

28:50.173 --> 28:53.673
Get that kid away from me.
He is a zombie.

28:57.317 --> 28:59.317
Where are you going?

28:59.699 --> 29:02.513
- Quickly before returning Sarah.
- Oh my God.

29:02.514 --> 29:05.014
Let's go to the cafeteria or so.

29:10.307 --> 29:12.307
I believe that he himself
feeling better.

29:13.428 --> 29:15.428
- This is amazing.
- Is that so?

29:16.153 --> 29:21.131
Yes, look at the tension of that muscle.
Really good, Cory.

29:21.132 --> 29:24.832
- It comes back, unbelievable.
- It's the wrong foot.

29:27.194 --> 29:30.225
I am healed.
Look, everything works again!

29:30.226 --> 29:32.226
Turn the camera but out.

29:53.391 --> 30:00.391
I need brain surgery again
to completely remove the AVM.

30:01.834 --> 30:05.730
But every time I turn
self-pity starting to get

30:05.731 --> 30:09.642
I think of all those people who
have affected much worse.

30:11.143 --> 30:17.143
Maybe I should not be so much
myself and think more of them.

30:21.536 --> 30:25.215
Hello. Is this seat taken?

30:25.216 --> 30:28.030
Please.

30:28.031 --> 30:31.060
So if you like chess?

30:31.061 --> 30:35.061
Yes, it is not Backgammon, but ...

30:37.556 --> 30:41.669
- I'm Cory.
- Ed Welch.

30:41.670 --> 30:45.349
Nice to meet you, Ed.

30:45.350 --> 30:48.978
- Why do not you start.
- Charity?

30:50.579 --> 30:53.392
Why are you here?

30:53.393 --> 30:55.558
I had a stroke.

30:55.559 --> 31:00.971
- At your age? Is that legal?
- I do not think so.

31:00.972 --> 31:04.218
It happened during basketball practice.

31:04.219 --> 31:06.383
Completely unexpected.

31:06.384 --> 31:12.228
I also once played basketball,
When the pants were still short.

31:12.229 --> 31:18.229
- I played <i> guard </ i>.
- I also, at Gettysburg College.</i>

31:25.652 --> 31:28.032
Who's turn is it?

31:28.033 --> 31:31.497
- I can not remember.
- Me neither.

31:31.498 --> 31:35.126
Brain damage is
life interesting.

31:37.127 --> 31:39.940
Indeed.

31:39.941 --> 31:42.754
This time you have to concentrate, Ed.

31:42.755 --> 31:45.033
You start this time but.

31:49.034 --> 31:52.714
After the surgery, I go five
times as hard to do my best.

31:52.715 --> 31:57.043
I'm going to work to 500
shots to throw every day.

31:57.044 --> 32:00.157
I know that.
No doubt about it.

32:01.158 --> 32:03.158
Well, I ...

32:04.189 --> 32:08.540
I'll see you when I wake up.

32:19.994 --> 32:23.494
- I love you.
- I love you.

32:39.578 --> 32:41.959
Please.
One medium citizen.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.052
- Thank you, Mr. Weissman.
- There is more though.

32:51.053 --> 32:54.733
- You have a rap name required by the headscarf.
- Cory's AVM.

32:54.734 --> 32:57.114
What happens now?

32:57.115 --> 33:01.010
This summer therapy
and then back to school.

33:01.011 --> 33:04.908
And then I do my best to
to get back into the team.

33:04.909 --> 33:07.505
The doctor said
is that really possible?

33:07.506 --> 33:11.052
She did not say
that it would not be possible.

33:12.053 --> 33:15.083
Besides, I get a special permit,
if I'm released from the hospital.

33:15.084 --> 33:19.084
- With a disabled parking permit.
- Beautiful. Free parking.

33:23.312 --> 33:29.588
- What is that?
- Amy Powers keeps her birthday in the new tent.

33:29.589 --> 33:33.269
- sounds fun. Do you want to go?
- No I can not.

33:33.270 --> 33:35.670
- You go.
- Okay.

33:38.466 --> 33:41.866
Just go.
It sounds nice.

33:43.012 --> 33:47.412
No do not bother.
Let's get some food.

33:49.074 --> 33:50.574
Okay.

34:07.477 --> 34:10.074
What are you looking at?

34:10.074 --> 34:12.456
Is this really what you do all day?

34:12.456 --> 34:16.456
Eating, sleeping and waiting
until someone comes home?

34:19.385 --> 34:22.414
Is that all?

34:22.415 --> 34:26.527
No secret things dogs
are up to when nobody is looking?

34:26.529 --> 34:29.775
Guide your spy agency?

34:29.775 --> 34:32.775
You slip into the liquor cabinet
when nobody is looking?

34:34.107 --> 34:37.107
I feel that you can talk to.

34:38.436 --> 34:42.982
So if you're not rehabilitating,
you hang around here all day?

34:42.983 --> 34:46.661
You make it sound boring.
I mean, the mail comes,

34:46.663 --> 34:49.043
Sometimes, the phone rings.

34:49.045 --> 34:54.672
And when are you going to
Decreasing use drugs?

34:54.674 --> 35:00.734
And then no more legal parties?
No, they can not do.

35:00.735 --> 35:03.735
At least not yet.

35:06.581 --> 35:10.261
-Who is it?
-Kylie.

35:10.262 --> 35:16.189
- They get together for a volleyball tournament.
- Beautiful.

35:17.190 --> 35:21.302
It seems fun.

35:21.303 --> 35:24.803
- Can you come?
- No.

35:25.200 --> 35:28.962
I can not go.
I need to rest.

35:29.963 --> 35:32.559
I will not leave you here.

35:33.860 --> 35:37.757
It does not matter.
I still need some time

35:37.758 --> 35:41.036
to my baseball cards
alphabetical order to explain.

35:41.437 --> 35:43.437
What, huh?

35:44.253 --> 35:46.253
I'm kidding.

35:48.798 --> 35:50.298
What is it?

35:53.995 --> 35:57.890
I am so sorry.

35:57.891 --> 35:59.991
I do not like someone.

36:02.005 --> 36:04.005
What kind of person?

36:05.902 --> 36:08.565
Someone who can not handle this.

36:09.366 --> 36:12.395
Someone who is so selfish
and only thinks

36:12.396 --> 36:16.608
how difficult it is to
To have a friend with a disability.

36:17.809 --> 36:21.004
I wanna be the one
which is on your side

36:23.005 --> 36:26.468
in prosperity and adversity
waiting for you.

36:26.469 --> 36:30.469
By anyone who
admires for her sacrifice.

36:32.098 --> 36:34.098
But I'm not.

36:35.346 --> 36:41.407
As much as I would like it to be,
it's not me.

36:41.408 --> 36:43.408
And thus...?

36:49.435 --> 36:51.435
Get it?

36:54.414 --> 36:56.527
Is that what you mean?

36:58.528 --> 37:00.857
Who should I be?

37:02.858 --> 37:08.918
The one who says, sure,
it does not matter?

37:08.919 --> 37:16.019
- No.
- Do you have any idea what I've been through?

37:17.580 --> 37:21.880
- I have not done anything to deserve this.
- I know.

37:22.992 --> 37:26.553
I have to fight for everything.
Fighting for my strength.

37:29.054 --> 37:33.254
Fighting for my memory,
Fighting for basketball.

37:36.198 --> 37:40.259
And I'm going to win.
I'm going to win!

37:42.000 --> 37:46.530
But my girlfriend can not even
few months to wait until I'm better.

37:46.591 --> 37:50.270
Can not wait that long.
Is that fair?

37:50.271 --> 37:53.466
That's not it.

37:55.467 --> 38:00.900
And this does not deserve you.
I am so sorry.

38:50.674 --> 38:52.437
Ha, dude.

38:55.438 --> 38:59.550
- Is everything OK?
- I have to do this driving test.

38:59.551 --> 39:03.447
- Sure, if the therapist gives permission.
- Actually, now.

39:03.448 --> 39:08.073
If I were here longer alone
I'm in this house is crazy.

39:12.974 --> 39:16.220
Slightly slower, ink
your license is still wet.

39:16.221 --> 39:20.550
- You may 45 here, I drive 35.
- Do me a favor.

39:20.551 --> 39:24.880
Remember how grandma drove slowly?
We were crazy.

39:24.881 --> 39:30.726
You're doing the same.
I've actually been thinking a lot grandmother.

39:30.727 --> 39:33.540
It was two years ago
and I still miss her every day.

39:33.541 --> 39:39.169
I always wonder
if she's out there somewhere outside,

39:39.170 --> 39:43.282
watches over us or anything.

39:43.283 --> 39:45.881
I know what you mean.

39:45.882 --> 39:50.427
Sometimes I swear
she sits next to me.

39:50.428 --> 39:52.592
Even inside me.

39:52.593 --> 39:58.870
When I had my stroke, I saw
no white light or anything, but ...

39:58.871 --> 40:00.871
I could feel that she was with me.

40:11.428 --> 40:15.706
- Why are you here all along?
- Here's less traffic.

40:17.507 --> 40:19.887
I'm thinking
go back to school.

40:19.888 --> 40:26.165
- In the spring you can go to school.
- Not in the spring, but within a few weeks.

40:26.166 --> 40:28.981
Look how far I've progressed.

40:28.982 --> 40:32.011
- I can drive myself to school.
- One step at a time.

40:32.012 --> 40:39.156
I've already spoken with the dean.
The school supports me one hundred ...

40:39.157 --> 40:41.271
- Mom?
- On the side.

40:41.972 --> 40:45.084
- On the side.
- Mom.

40:47.585 --> 40:49.085
You have a seizure.

40:49.116 --> 40:51.362
Do not worry, honey.

40:52.363 --> 40:54.458
It'll be fine.

40:57.559 --> 40:59.088
You have a seizure.

41:02.889 --> 41:05.249
- Mom!
- It'll be over.

41:09.250 --> 41:11.012
It is well.

41:23.755 --> 41:27.868
During the restoration of the second operation,
make new abnormal nerve connections

41:27.869 --> 41:32.198
which can cause seizures.
As you experienced.

41:32.199 --> 41:35.878
- Will there be more?
- Very probably.

41:35.879 --> 41:40.142
- Would anticonvulsant help?
- Is there a drug-free way?

41:40.543 --> 41:45.393
You need to stressful situations and large
amounts avoid sensory information.

41:45.406 --> 41:48.219
- Maybe, but not back to school.
- I'm going back to school.

41:48.220 --> 41:53.848
- Is that a good idea?
- I recommend to preliminary therapy to continue at home.

41:53.849 --> 41:57.095
Since it is easier
in order to monitor the situation.

41:57.096 --> 42:01.016
We can do everything
Spring reassess.

42:02.292 --> 42:06.292
The final decision rests
However, you and your family.

42:15.499 --> 42:17.879
- ATO, here we come.
- ATO.

42:17.880 --> 42:20.911
- Is that boy, <i> Sundance </ i>, still in school?
- That's still there.</i>

42:20.912 --> 42:24.158
That boy is crazy.
I think I get more money from him.

42:24.159 --> 42:26.539
Wait, Cory.
Let me help you.

42:26.540 --> 42:30.040
It succeeds dad.
Thanks anyway.

42:35.201 --> 42:38.047
Three and a half hours, Pops.
Hopefully you have some good music.

42:38.448 --> 42:40.648
I think I own
all the way going to sing.

42:44.510 --> 42:46.510
- Was that it?
- Yep.

42:50.139 --> 42:54.039
- Keep you strong, boy.
- I will miss you.

42:55.551 --> 42:56.828
Mam ...

43:01.829 --> 43:04.643
Do not ... do not cry.

43:04.644 --> 43:07.041
Easy for you
to say that.

43:07.242 --> 43:12.221
Thanks to you, I have come this far.
You did.

43:12.222 --> 43:15.467
Should you ever let me go, anyway.
If I fail, then ...

43:15.500 --> 43:20.262
- What then. Then I come back home.
- You'll do it.

43:21.531 --> 43:24.031
Thank you.

43:25.212 --> 43:27.324
Thanks to you...

43:29.325 --> 43:33.386
- I love you.
- Yes, I love you.

43:35.387 --> 43:38.805
Pops! Off to school.

43:53.140 --> 43:55.640
SECOND YEAR

44:03.099 --> 44:06.427
Weissman, look at that.
You've still got it.

44:08.728 --> 44:11.774
This is still nothing, coach.
Wait till I get back.

44:11.975 --> 44:14.975
One step at a time.
That is recovering.

44:15.223 --> 44:17.387
I mean, not rehabilitation.

44:17.388 --> 44:23.449
- I mean when I return to the team.
- Cory, you know that I will always support.

44:23.450 --> 44:26.912
I know it now
all a bit premature,

44:26.913 --> 44:32.407
but I make a lot of progress.
I'll be back.

44:33.408 --> 44:36.223
You know why I'm yours
so wanted to join the team?

44:36.224 --> 44:37.734
Because of my good looks?

44:37.735 --> 44:42.725
Because you are one of those players
which passes through walls as needed.

44:42.935 --> 44:47.480
Watch how you handle your accident.
Many would have given up already.

44:47.481 --> 44:50.944
But not you.
That's why I love you so, as a player,

44:50.945 --> 44:52.945
and as a person.

44:53.327 --> 44:58.955
If basketball was only going to perseverance,
there would be a shoe for you to be named.

44:58.956 --> 45:04.584
But we both know that at this level,
Basketball is a heavy, physical and foul play.

45:04.585 --> 45:09.996
If you have the resources to compete not have,
it does not matter how big your heart is.

45:09.997 --> 45:15.041
I'm honest with you,
because I respect you as a man.

45:15.842 --> 45:19.721
I know how much
you want to return.

45:20.822 --> 45:25.584
- I'd like you to come back.
- Coach.

45:25.585 --> 45:28.182
I scored a thousand points
in high school.

45:28.183 --> 45:33.162
I'm going to my school not
finish with zero points.

45:33.163 --> 45:37.770
Okay, maybe not this year.
But next year!

45:43.571 --> 45:48.571
Coach.
I should be part of the team.

45:49.633 --> 45:53.529
I will do whatever it takes.

45:53.530 --> 45:59.530
We need someone to track
statistics and help exercises.

45:59.531 --> 46:02.560
Yes, I will.

46:03.272 --> 46:09.333
- But I'm going to play again, coach.
- Okay.

46:09.334 --> 46:14.679
Here, Monday, 17:00.
Be on time.

46:15.180 --> 46:16.980
All right, Coach.

46:21.459 --> 46:22.959
And I'm going to score.

46:28.169 --> 46:31.200
That kid ruined the whole party.

46:31.201 --> 46:33.001
Yes, not normal.

46:45.057 --> 46:50.057
Very funny. Very funny.
You guys are hilarious.

47:06.490 --> 47:09.490
Let's start.
Two rows.

47:14.284 --> 47:16.284
Are you going to fill the water bottles.

47:18.614 --> 47:21.211
Show me what you got.

47:21.212 --> 47:22.712
Touch the line!

47:25.109 --> 47:29.109
- Put that down time!
- Okay, guys, pace!

47:31.170 --> 47:32.670
Come on!

47:33.300 --> 47:35.188
Touch the line!

47:36.583 --> 47:38.883
Who's first?

47:45.243 --> 47:47.424
Okay, water break.

47:47.625 --> 47:50.603
Good job.
Nice pace, man.

47:52.604 --> 47:55.881
I would do anything at this time,
to swap places with you.

47:58.882 --> 48:02.160
Well done, man.
Good job.

48:05.161 --> 48:07.542
What classes you follow?

48:07.543 --> 48:12.954
Sociology, kinesiology
and linear algebra.

48:12.955 --> 48:15.769
You're not kidding about the
do full selection.

48:15.770 --> 48:17.934
I'm really excited.

48:17.935 --> 48:22.346
- Work hard or go home.
- Pops wants to go home.

48:23.347 --> 48:26.147
- See you later.
- See you later.

48:27.244 --> 48:31.573
Class, I want you on the matter
the spiercelvezels understand.

48:31.574 --> 48:35.037
Muscle cells consist of myofibril.

48:35.038 --> 48:39.584
Each consists of myofibril
hundreds of sarcomeres

48:39.585 --> 48:41.748
which lie one behind the other.

48:41.749 --> 48:46.094
When the muscle contracts,
shrink the sarcomeres ...

48:47.595 --> 48:52.141
... By the side of
the myosin hyphae.

48:52.142 --> 48:55.388
Take the text that I gave you.

48:55.389 --> 48:59.889
and then we take some notes on.

50:08.783 --> 50:13.760
- I'll make you into.
- Please boy, computers let me win.

50:13.761 --> 50:18.740
- Let you win?
- You throw only 80 percent, that's a problem.

50:18.741 --> 50:23.287
- You're the problem.
- What?

50:23.288 --> 50:29.133
Last week you badly in this game, now you play badly
and probably play again next week bad.

50:29.134 --> 50:32.813
Okay. Want to tell me
What's bothering you?

50:32.814 --> 50:36.114
Nothing.
Play now but.

50:43.222 --> 50:45.222
So you're not telling me?

50:46.902 --> 50:50.181
I must invent through
a list in the locker room?

50:51.882 --> 50:55.778
You start as <i> point guard </ i>, dude.</i>

50:55.779 --> 51:00.541
That violent man.
Congratulations.

51:00.542 --> 51:02.922
I did not know how you'd take it.

51:02.923 --> 51:04.723
I am happy for you.

51:13.316 --> 51:17.316
- Do you need help?
- No, I'm fine.

51:30.419 --> 51:33.181
Cory! Is everything okay?

51:35.182 --> 51:37.444
Oh my God.
Are you okay?

51:38.645 --> 51:41.709
Is everything alright?
Let me help you.

51:41.710 --> 51:44.172
- I am fine!
- Let me help you.

51:45.573 --> 51:47.573
Sit down.

51:54.467 --> 51:56.467
Sit down.

52:02.694 --> 52:06.539
- Guest
- It's okay, dude.

52:08.540 --> 52:13.532
I have only three times
cried in my entire life.

52:16.333 --> 52:19.011
And the last eight months ...

52:22.612 --> 52:24.992
I do not know what happens to me.

52:24.993 --> 52:28.239
You were always better than me, Cory.

52:28.240 --> 52:33.219
Pops ...
You do not say.

52:33.220 --> 52:35.817
Oh yes,
because it's true.

52:35.818 --> 52:40.796
That does not
I must be a jerk

52:40.797 --> 52:43.828
thinking you my place
have taken on the team.

52:43.829 --> 52:46.829
You're only human.

52:54.220 --> 52:59.849
I mean...
It's all better, right?

52:59.850 --> 53:03.961
- Sure, man.
- Eventually, it should anyway.

53:03.962 --> 53:07.962
Have you ever considered,
to talk to someone?

53:12.623 --> 53:17.123
The only time I ever such a thing
have been done during rehabilitation.

53:17.818 --> 53:23.447
There was such a strange therapist there
thought I'd kill myself.

53:23.448 --> 53:27.448
Was the only time that I was considering at
when that guy talked to me.

53:34.057 --> 53:39.251
Should I talk about my childhood
or so?

53:39.252 --> 53:43.148
I do not think we back
should go to your childhood.

53:43.149 --> 53:45.962
What brought you here today?

53:45.963 --> 53:50.509
I've had a stroke last year.
And I just started school again.

53:50.510 --> 53:52.890
I was really excited.

53:52.891 --> 53:57.552
I was glad I had my life again
could get back on track.

53:58.953 --> 54:05.015
It is actually anyway
harder than I expected.

54:05.016 --> 54:08.696
- What?
- According to the doctors, my brains

54:08.697 --> 54:15.190
still not fully recovered,
so I get tired easily.

54:15.191 --> 54:17.736
I can not learn.

54:19.737 --> 54:23.149
I'm tense.
Really tense.

54:25.150 --> 54:26.727
I can not ...

54:32.728 --> 54:34.228
I never
been depressed.

54:34.229 --> 54:39.229
So you think that the stroke
the cause of the depression?

54:40.088 --> 54:43.118
It is said that therapists
just ask questions.

54:43.119 --> 54:47.881
- We are a curious people.
- Everyone tells me,

54:47.882 --> 54:51.129
I have too much hay
Take my fork.

54:51.130 --> 54:55.459
I just want as quickly as possible
return to how it was.

54:55.460 --> 55:02.603
- Why the rush?
- When I was 13, I broke my leg in football.

55:02.604 --> 55:06.284
A guy tackled me from behind.
It was a complicated fracture.

55:06.285 --> 55:11.912
It looked bad. The doctor said
that the recovery would last half a year.

55:11.913 --> 55:15.292
and eight months,
before I could play again.

55:16.693 --> 55:21.239
After four months I did
again join a tournament.

55:21.240 --> 55:23.620
I set a goal,
and reached that goal.

55:23.621 --> 55:27.301
- What are your goals now?
- Return on the basketball court.

55:27.302 --> 55:31.446
So you want to be the same Cory
and before your stroke.

55:31.470 --> 55:33.470
Yes.

55:34.447 --> 55:37.260
And that will happen.

55:37.261 --> 55:42.061
THIRD YEAR

55:55.447 --> 55:59.775
Right there. You see?
That's going a lot better.

55:59.776 --> 56:04.848
That feels good.
Unbelievable.

56:13.849 --> 56:16.663
Excuse me.
Hi.

56:16.664 --> 56:20.776
- I'm Cory.
- I am treated at my ankle.

56:20.777 --> 56:25.539
Yes I can see that.
Does that mean I should not know your name?

56:25.540 --> 56:27.920
- I'm Jess.
- Nice to meet you, Jess.

56:27.921 --> 56:32.467
Are you new here?
I still have not seen.

56:32.468 --> 56:34.848
I am a first-year student.

56:34.849 --> 56:38.746
- Welcome to Gettysburg.
- Cory, this is not the time.

56:38.747 --> 56:42.209
You should know that I
not trying to decorate though.

56:42.210 --> 56:47.622
I am a third year student.
We must welcome the new welcome.

56:47.623 --> 56:51.086
So it is rather my duty.

56:51.087 --> 56:53.900
The school will appreciate your sacrifice.

56:53.901 --> 56:57.580
That is certainly appreciated.
They call me a doer all here, right?

56:57.581 --> 56:59.081
Among other things.

57:00.613 --> 57:04.375
I have sprained my ankle.
And I hate it.

57:05.076 --> 57:10.271
- I can not move me well.
- I know the feeling.

57:10.572 --> 57:13.635
Believe me, it sucks.

57:13.736 --> 57:15.900
How about yourself,
Mr. doer?

57:16.201 --> 57:19.201
I also have a sore ankle.

57:19.465 --> 57:22.078
It really hurts.
We have something in common.

57:22.479 --> 57:25.076
- Keep working on it.
- I will.

57:25.077 --> 57:30.705
- It was nice to meet you.
- Bye.

57:30.706 --> 57:34.952
- Just?
- It does occasionally really hurt.

57:35.253 --> 57:36.963
Really.

57:41.964 --> 57:44.561
Listen!
Brand new year guys.

57:44.562 --> 57:46.942
Last season has been!

57:46.943 --> 57:49.541
The future is ours!

57:49.542 --> 57:52.138
I think I my
speech should be revised.

57:52.139 --> 57:57.139
- Looks good, Cory.
- 500 shots per day ensures there.

57:57.552 --> 58:01.031
Let's start then.
Form the rows.

58:01.132 --> 58:02.482
Where are you going?

58:02.483 --> 58:05.783
- Water Bottle Filling
- I told the team to form rows.

58:19.651 --> 58:21.151
Come on!

58:40.202 --> 58:42.999
If we continue
will be fine.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.526
Yeah, you're Pop's size.

58:53.193 --> 58:55.693
Try it.

58:58.171 --> 58:59.552
No.

59:00.553 --> 59:03.553
I wait until I really
may use in a game.

59:03.801 --> 59:06.182
It looks good.

59:06.183 --> 59:08.183
Yes definitely.

59:12.027 --> 59:16.573
- Hey Sundance? Well played today.
- Thank you.

59:16.574 --> 59:18.971
That was great?
How is the company?

59:18.972 --> 59:20.448
Not bad.

59:20.472 --> 59:23.472
- The new girls will soon come.
- Okay.

59:23.502 --> 59:25.502
So you like basketball?

59:28.049 --> 59:29.749
I'll be right back.

59:38.440 --> 59:42.986
You know that we are the only student in the
campus that serves pizza at our parties?

59:42.987 --> 59:45.800
- That can not be true.
- Really.

59:45.801 --> 59:49.481
- How are you?
- Good.

59:49.482 --> 59:53.482
- How are you?
- My ankle hurts a lot.

59:53.595 --> 59:57.095
That's too bad.
I'm Cory.

59:59.657 --> 01:00:03.121
- I'm Jess.
- Nice to meet you, Jess.

01:00:03.122 --> 01:00:08.122
- What year are you?
- First.

01:00:09.617 --> 01:00:13.461
- Was that strange question?
- Do you mean this?

01:00:15.462 --> 01:00:18.440
Wait. What did I ...?

01:00:20.441 --> 01:00:23.441
Jess! Hey Jess.

01:00:24.339 --> 01:00:28.739
Wait a second.
I have offended you in any way?

01:00:29.118 --> 01:00:32.230
We have another two days
ago met in the gym.

01:00:33.231 --> 01:00:35.231
- I remember.
- Cool. Bye.

01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:37.087
No, no, listen.

01:00:37.088 --> 01:00:40.355
You do not understand, I forgot
because I had a stroke.

01:00:40.359 --> 01:00:43.173
Okay. You are a
student with a stroke.

01:00:43.174 --> 01:00:45.338
I mean I really had a stroke.

01:00:45.339 --> 01:00:49.884
Damaged brain tissue and blood vessels
broke. Everything. The AVM was torn.

01:00:49.885 --> 01:00:53.885
- You should not joke about.
- Pops!

01:00:54.215 --> 01:00:58.544
- Will you tell her about my brains.
- That's a mush.

01:00:58.545 --> 01:01:00.926
- And my memory?
- Disappeared.

01:01:00.927 --> 01:01:04.539
- And were you in the hospital?
- Every day.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.854
I'm still recovering.

01:01:07.855 --> 01:01:10.855
It's pretty heroic,
if you think about it.

01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:15.206
Oh, you two have been together ...

01:01:16.748 --> 01:01:18.748
That's actually kinda cute,
He liked you so beautiful,

01:01:18.749 --> 01:01:21.749
- That he wanted to meet you twice.
- Exactly

01:01:26.706 --> 01:01:30.901
I first started in the third grade
to play high school.

01:01:31.702 --> 01:01:34.516
Amazing and still in the team.
That is fantastic.

01:01:34.717 --> 01:01:38.613
It was hard work but I
did not think I would find it so much.

01:01:38.614 --> 01:01:42.294
I never thought of myself as a
Lacrosse seen playing athlete.

01:01:42.295 --> 01:01:46.489
What did you do first?
What?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.628
It is embarrassing.

01:01:49.142 --> 01:01:52.142
- Now you have to tell me.
- I wanted to fight.

01:01:53.119 --> 01:01:56.698
- What? Pest?
- Yes.

01:01:58.099 --> 01:02:00.263
- I hate bugs.
- Yes, me too.

01:02:00.264 --> 01:02:02.861
Does not mean that all my life
go spend to make them dead.

01:02:02.862 --> 01:02:06.325
- I'm mad that ankle.
- Yes you are walking with a slight limp.

01:02:06.326 --> 01:02:09.139
You look like me.

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:11.735
- Are you cold?
- Yes.

01:02:14.336 --> 01:02:17.336
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:02:20.182 --> 01:02:22.862
I had a nice evening.

01:02:23.863 --> 01:02:25.975
Yes, really nice evening.

01:02:27.576 --> 01:02:31.987
- Yeah, not bad.
- Not bad?

01:02:33.388 --> 01:02:35.985
- I Was not entertaining enough?
- No not at all.

01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:40.232
Did not you have fun with me?
I had a lot of fun.

01:02:40.533 --> 01:02:43.602
-Maybe I lied a little.
Maybe.

01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:58.770
Now I have even more fun.

01:03:01.317 --> 01:03:04.346
Yes, if you do not now
more recalls, after that?

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:09.053
I have a blackout.
I think I need more memory.

01:03:17.354 --> 01:03:20.054
- That felt good.
- Yes.

01:03:47.647 --> 01:03:50.007
Keith, change!

01:03:55.008 --> 01:03:56.508
- Back play, Nino.

01:04:07.782 --> 01:04:09.678
Be careful now!

01:04:11.679 --> 01:04:13.679
Look out, Tim!

01:04:40.473 --> 01:04:43.236
- Want me to get help?
- No!

01:04:43.937 --> 01:04:47.400
- You do not want me to call someone?
- No.

01:04:47.401 --> 01:04:50.463
Okay, it'll be fine.
I'm here.

01:04:53.464 --> 01:04:57.964
It's okay, all right.
I'm here.

01:05:14.264 --> 01:05:17.294
His chances this season
play with less.

01:05:17.295 --> 01:05:19.295
You think he's ready?

01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:32.470
I know, if he does not play,
he collapses.

01:05:42.842 --> 01:05:45.253
Cory. Come to my office.

01:05:48.054 --> 01:05:50.054
This does work.

01:05:59.512 --> 01:06:02.512
- Hey.
- Hey, coach.

01:06:06.007 --> 01:06:09.253
I must tell you this season
have made a great impression on me.

01:06:09.254 --> 01:06:12.934
First in training
and last to leave.

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:16.181
I know that you train as a
beast in your spare time.

01:06:16.182 --> 01:06:18.282
I'll do whatever it takes, coach.

01:06:21.162 --> 01:06:25.162
I also know how much you
want to join a game.

01:06:28.739 --> 01:06:31.739
- But that will not succeed.
- What?

01:06:32.204 --> 01:06:36.748
You're better, but you're not done yet.
I know you still have seizures.

01:06:36.749 --> 01:06:39.264
I'm going to get no attack
during the game.

01:06:39.265 --> 01:06:43.160
If it happens there ...
The risk is too great.

01:06:43.261 --> 01:06:47.739
Coach.
I've earned this.

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:54.107
I know. Sorry.

01:07:31.324 --> 01:07:32.624
And?

01:07:49.943 --> 01:07:53.622
My whole life...

01:07:53.623 --> 01:07:56.870
I thought everything
happens for a reason.

01:07:56.871 --> 01:08:00.767
That's right, Cory.

01:08:00.768 --> 01:08:03.063
It also happens for a reason.

01:08:05.964 --> 01:08:09.107
I have in my entire life
never given up anything.

01:08:12.908 --> 01:08:15.289
For the first time,
I consider it.

01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:18.537
After everything you've been through,
why now?

01:08:18.537 --> 01:08:21.537
I realized that I'm living in a dream.

01:08:24.383 --> 01:08:29.010
I thought, if you work hard,
you can achieve anything.

01:08:30.011 --> 01:08:33.011
As all these stupid tile
wisdoms on my wall.

01:08:38.022 --> 01:08:42.216
Things happen in life. Some
people are good, some are not.

01:08:43.218 --> 01:08:46.331
That's a stark view.

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:50.178
Think about it, Cory.

01:08:50.578 --> 01:08:54.475
Two years ago you were paralyzed.

01:08:54.475 --> 01:08:57.721
When you went back to school,

01:08:57.723 --> 01:09:00.321
and inspired other people.

01:09:00.322 --> 01:09:03.716
Nobody would by me
to be inspired.

01:09:05.517 --> 01:09:08.017
If that is so, see
they are things that are not there.

01:09:10.497 --> 01:09:15.475
So you're just a kid,
who can no longer play basketball.

01:09:15.477 --> 01:09:19.676
With all due respect, this has
nothing to do with basketball.

01:09:21.106 --> 01:09:22.950
I ...

01:09:26.951 --> 01:09:29.451
I just want to be myself again.

01:09:29.549 --> 01:09:33.560
- Maybe that's the problem.
- What?

01:09:34.961 --> 01:09:39.761
- You no longer Cory can be.
- Really?

01:09:41.456 --> 01:09:43.837
I do not really have a choice.

01:09:43.837 --> 01:09:46.868
- The old Cory is gone.
- Sorry, what?

01:09:46.868 --> 01:09:49.895
- The old Cory is gone.
- Sorry, I ...

01:09:49.895 --> 01:09:52.895
The old Cory is gone!
He is dead!

01:09:55.096 --> 01:09:57.096
Do you hear me?

01:10:02.673 --> 01:10:05.073
He was buried.

01:10:11.334 --> 01:10:15.895
That does not mean there
no new Cory can be.

01:10:16.096 --> 01:10:21.396
That is ten times more,
Cory than ever.

01:10:31.467 --> 01:10:34.065
<I> Cory, you do not know me. </ I>

01:10:34.066 --> 01:10:37.528
<I> I heard the story of your
return on local radio. </ i>

01:10:37.529 --> 01:10:41.209
<I> I hope you do not
mind that I write to you. </ i>

01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:45.755
<I> Like you, my six-year-old
son also an athlete. </ i>

01:10:45.756 --> 01:10:50.302
<I> He also has an AVM
and had a stroke. </ i>

01:10:50.303 --> 01:10:52.683
<I> A portion of its left hand side
is still paralyzed </ i>

01:10:52.684 --> 01:10:58.312
<I> and the doctors are not sure
how well he will recover. </ i>

01:10:58.313 --> 01:11:00.911
<I> Evan is a fighter
and he does his best. </ i> "

01:11:00.912 --> 01:11:05.890
<I> But, as you probably know,
some days are more difficult than others </ i>

01:11:05.891 --> 01:11:12.168
<I> I told him about you, how you try again
to play and that motivated him tremendously. </ i>

01:11:12.169 --> 01:11:15.416
<I> I understand you probably busy
you with your studies and basketball </ i>

01:11:15.417 --> 01:11:19.313
<I> But if you ever have the time
to write Evan or even call </ i>

01:11:19.314 --> 01:11:21.911
<I> that would mean a lot to him. </ I>

01:11:21.912 --> 01:11:25.808
<I> Thank you for your time and I
hope I have not offended. </ i>

01:11:25.809 --> 01:11:28.809
<I> Sincerely,
Jen Carlow. </ I>

01:11:34.469 --> 01:11:36.469
Beautiful.

01:11:36.851 --> 01:11:40.097
- How are you, Pops?
- Someone was absent from the exercises.

01:11:40.098 --> 01:11:43.561
- The team is not the same without you.
- Yes I know.

01:11:43.562 --> 01:11:45.808
They certainly miss their mascot.

01:11:46.809 --> 01:11:50.809
I am serious.
The team respects you.

01:11:52.871 --> 01:11:56.232
- So you're coming back next year, right?
- I do not know.

01:11:58.933 --> 01:12:02.262
How long can someone
to sit on the bench?

01:12:04.563 --> 01:12:09.540
- Beautiful. Bring it on.
- Really?

01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:13.221
- come on.
- Really, guest?

01:12:13.222 --> 01:12:15.067
Go.

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.448
You see?

01:12:21.249 --> 01:12:24.518
That has nothing to do with your stroke
make, you could never left.

01:12:38.985 --> 01:12:42.232
LAST YEAR

01:12:48.512 --> 01:12:52.624
Thank you all for coming.
I do not know...

01:12:52.625 --> 01:12:56.625
Can someone write this quickly.
It's his new Gettysburg Address.

01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:58.739
I want to say something.

01:13:00.852 --> 01:13:03.233
Cory, you know,
when you got your stroke,

01:13:03.234 --> 01:13:06.713
that was the scariest
moment of my life.

01:13:06.914 --> 01:13:09.728
I can not imagine
how it was for you.

01:13:09.729 --> 01:13:14.057
I think nobody
that can be imagined.

01:13:14.058 --> 01:13:19.470
But I do know that you are the strongest,
coolest guy are in this room.

01:13:19.471 --> 01:13:23.071
And I want you to know
I'm always behind you.

01:13:25.749 --> 01:13:29.429
- I know Pops. Thank you.
- No.

01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:33.057
- I could not help with the packing.
- Really.

01:13:35.058 --> 01:13:38.305
What is this?
I hope for you it's something beautiful.

01:13:38.306 --> 01:13:41.512
At least one <i> monogram print </ i>.</i>

01:13:51.513 --> 01:13:53.513
Not really.

01:13:57.375 --> 01:13:58.875
Guest.

01:14:03.436 --> 01:14:06.116
Thank you, Pops.

01:14:07.117 --> 01:14:13.178
This is the second best gift
that I have ever received from you.

01:14:13.179 --> 01:14:18.591
- Second, what is the first?
- When you have saved my life, dude. Thank you.

01:14:18.592 --> 01:14:24.385
I'd say you've got something I owe,
but some things can not be refunded.

01:14:26.386 --> 01:14:30.498
- I know.
- I want to practice on Monday, what do you think of it.

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:32.746
That's what I meant.

01:14:33.747 --> 01:14:37.158
Okay, <i> whatup </ i>
Let's party, come on!</i>

01:14:39.159 --> 01:14:41.756
That was good cut ...

01:14:41.757 --> 01:14:44.787
Good work, guys!

01:14:44.788 --> 01:14:48.788
Before you shower,
Friday is our first game.

01:14:52.582 --> 01:14:55.211
Time to vote for your captain.
For the novices among you,

01:14:55.212 --> 01:14:59.212
Coaches have nothing to do with it.
It is yours.

01:15:28.304 --> 01:15:33.304
Okay.
The first captain ... Tim Lang.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:41.532
Number two. The final year student
with Salt-n-Pepa Hair, Pops.

01:15:43.893 --> 01:15:46.489
Super!

01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:50.169
Number three.

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:53.170
Congratulations, Cory.

01:16:07.924 --> 01:16:13.335
You are listening to Sport 1090. Online with
Gettysburg head basketball coach George Petrie.

01:16:13.336 --> 01:16:16.582
- A fantastic season, coach.
- There is still work to do, but thank you.

01:16:16.583 --> 01:16:19.830
Tell us something about
the final Saturday.

01:16:19.831 --> 01:16:24.376
Washington is a tough team.
Coach Nugent has done a good job.

01:16:24.377 --> 01:16:29.377
It is also an important match. You
can Gettysburg coach with the most profit are.

01:16:29.401 --> 01:16:32.401
We are not focusing on,
it is seniors day.

01:16:32.405 --> 01:16:36.405
Hopefully we assist guests on
the right path for their new season.

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:40.662
Good! Good!

01:16:42.906 --> 01:16:46.369
- Hey, Pops.
- Hey, coach. do you have a moment?

01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:50.483
- What's bugging you?
- Cory.

01:16:50.484 --> 01:16:55.895
Oh, me too. I spent three nights
not slept with him.

01:16:55.896 --> 01:17:00.225
It's now or never.
He sat on the bench for two years.

01:17:00.226 --> 01:17:03.906
Have you ever wondered
how it will end for him

01:17:03.907 --> 01:17:08.235
if he gets injured or
attack gets for the home crowd?

01:17:08.236 --> 01:17:11.916
- I know it's a risk.
- And then also the school's responsibility.

01:17:11.917 --> 01:17:14.029
Yeah, but he's ...
-Pops.

01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:18.586
I know that making the right decision.

01:17:28.587 --> 01:17:32.587
Cory?
Got a minute?

01:17:56.515 --> 01:17:59.041
- Hey?
- Hey, Mom.

01:18:06.042 --> 01:18:09.542
I spoke with the coach
about tomorrow's game.

01:18:13.836 --> 01:18:16.836
I stand at the base, Mom.

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:27.000
I stand at the base.

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:22.032
Cory?

01:19:22.033 --> 01:19:25.033
Pops told me you were here.

01:19:28.095 --> 01:19:32.595
So, how are you today?

01:19:34.373 --> 01:19:37.003
- I'm alright.
- Beautiful.

01:19:38.704 --> 01:19:45.414
- How are you?
- I was gonna call you when I heard the news.

01:19:45.415 --> 01:19:47.715
but I did not dare.

01:19:50.394 --> 01:19:52.994
I just wanted to congratulate you.

01:19:54.508 --> 01:19:59.508
I know how hard you've worked for.
I'm proud of you.

01:19:59.921 --> 01:20:01.583
Thank you.

01:20:03.384 --> 01:20:07.384
Well, do your best.

01:20:09.013 --> 01:20:11.813
Maybe more than that.

01:20:13.993 --> 01:20:20.693
Ally. I want you to know that I understand
what happened between us.

01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:29.044
You do not have to feel guilty about anything.
Everything is good.

01:20:52.121 --> 01:20:54.718
- Coach.
- Do not count on your great victory.

01:20:54.719 --> 01:20:57.019
- That's why they play. Good luck.
- You too

01:21:04.678 --> 01:21:07.957
Cory. You know you
there must be off after the start.

01:21:07.958 --> 01:21:12.071
- I would have loved to.
- Is there really no way?

01:21:12.472 --> 01:21:15.672
- I can not risk a shot?
- No.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.400
Okay, coach.

01:21:21.565 --> 01:21:24.894
And now, starting with Gettysburg College.

01:21:25.695 --> 01:21:28.695
<I> Power forward </ i>: Tim Lang.

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:36.939
<I> Small forward </ i>: Alex Sturn.

01:21:40.417 --> 01:21:43.117
<I> Center </ i>: Christian BohrÃ©.

01:21:47.345 --> 01:21:51.345
<I> Shooting guard </ i>: Brendan Trelease.

01:21:56.871 --> 01:21:59.171
And <i> Point guard </ i> ...</i>

01:22:02.933 --> 01:22:06.933
... Cory Weissman!

01:22:21.768 --> 01:22:24.015
Come here!

01:22:25.016 --> 01:22:29.116
- Bullets at three.
- One, two, three, Bullets!

01:22:30.861 --> 01:22:32.361
Cory!

01:23:27.151 --> 01:23:28.377
Follow!

01:23:35.178 --> 01:23:36.978
Put pressure on the ball!

01:23:44.271 --> 01:23:45.771
Mount, Christian!

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.180
In formation!

01:23:58.343 --> 01:24:01.343
Cory.
Go in.

01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:05.689
Come on.

01:24:09.168 --> 01:24:13.468
He goes in there.
They put him in there!

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.880
- He can join!
- We know, honey.

01:24:34.065 --> 01:24:35.465
Go for it, Cory!

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:43.085
Go, Cory!

01:24:50.086 --> 01:24:53.632
Time out.
Gathering.

01:24:54.633 --> 01:24:56.133
Come here.

01:24:58.747 --> 01:25:03.857
Come here. I do not know what he plans
but we still have 20 seconds.

01:25:03.858 --> 01:25:07.105
Stay focused, okay.
Bullets, three.

01:25:07.406 --> 01:25:09.606
One, two, three, Bullets!

01:25:19.964 --> 01:25:22.292
Throw the ball to Cory!
Throw to No. 3!

01:25:24.293 --> 01:25:26.293
Beware, beware!

01:25:32.087 --> 01:25:34.087
They made an offense.

01:25:44.644 --> 01:25:46.644
He goes to the line.

01:25:51.356 --> 01:25:53.356
He has two pitches!

01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:04.584
You can make him better.

01:27:29.446 --> 01:27:33.125
Coach, I do not want anything
I've earned yourself.

01:27:33.326 --> 01:27:36.326
Remember the knees, Cory.
Knees.

01:27:37.873 --> 01:27:40.173
I scored a thousand points
in high school.

01:27:41.770 --> 01:27:43.770
I will play again, coach.

01:27:45.018 --> 01:27:49.018
I finish my school
not with zero points.

01:27:51.513 --> 01:27:54.313
I'm going to score.

01:28:34.812 --> 01:28:39.812
-Cory! Cory! Cory!
-Thank You, coach.

01:28:43.472 --> 01:28:44.832
Thank you.

01:28:50.833 --> 01:28:53.333
- Well done, son.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:28:53.564 --> 01:28:56.364
- Good.
- Have you seen those last moments?

01:29:04.472 --> 01:29:08.472
People say I have not changed,
but that is certainly so.

01:29:09.169 --> 01:29:14.169
