<i>from the Star Wars

<i>but harmless,

01:41.977 --> 01:44.025
<i>Is it time for that big operation?</i>

01:44.104 --> 01:47.483
<i>This may be the most
important decision of your life.</i>

<i>Police union leaders blame

<i>Dick Jones,

02:27.814 --> 02:29.782
<i>Every policeman knows

<i>that there are certain inherent risks

02:32.402 --> 02:33.574
<i>Ask any cop, he'll tell you,</i>

02:33.654 --> 02:36.077
<i>"If you can't stand the heat,
you better stay out of the kitchen."</i>

02:36.239 --> 02:39.994
<i>Although seriously wounded,

02:56.760 --> 02:57.932
<i>Good luck, Frank.</i>

03:07.354 --> 03:10.858
Attempted murder?
It's not like he killed someone.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.285
This is a clear violation
of my client's civil rights.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.206
Make it aggravated assault,
and I can make bail, in cash, now.

03:17.280 --> 03:21.035
Listen, pal, your client's a scumbag,
you're a scumbag,

03:21.118 --> 03:23.246
and scumbags see the judge
on Monday morning!

03:23.328 --> 03:27.299
Now get out of my police station,
and take laughing boy with you!

03:27.374 --> 03:28.671
Get over there!

03:29.876 --> 03:32.129
You have the right to remain
silent. Do you understand me?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.304
Sure, sure.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.098
- Priors?
- No.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.265
Hi.

03:36.341 --> 03:40.221
Uh, Murphy. Transferring in
from Metro South.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.805
Nice precinct.

03:42.514 --> 03:43.891
Yeah, pretty good.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.445
We work for a living down here, Murphy.
Get your armor and suit up.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.076
Please take me home!

03:55.152 --> 03:56.904
Not now, E.J.
Get a cup of coffee.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.079
Oh, Sarge.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.123
Stark, is there any
word on Frederickson?

04:00.198 --> 04:01.916
They're still listing
him as critical.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.336
His wife must be going
out of her mind.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.004
- Murphy, huh?
- Yeah, that's me.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.251
- Manson.
- Hi.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.082
What brings you to
this little paradise?

04:09.166 --> 04:11.840
Beats me, man. I think OCP's moving
a lot of new guys up here.

04:11.918 --> 04:15.843
Omni Consumer Products.
What a bunch of morons.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.640
They're gonna manage this department
right into the ground!

04:21.052 --> 04:22.770
- Where are you from?
- Metro South.

04:22.846 --> 04:23.938
Welcome to hell.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.357
- Murphy.
- Yo.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.355
You cut 10 guys
loose over on the east side.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.983
You try to get backup
when you're in a jam.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.780
Yeah, try to get a medevac
after you've been jammed.

04:32.856 --> 04:35.780
I'll tell you what we should do.
We should strike. Fuck 'em!

04:48.205 --> 04:49.377
Oh, boy.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.083
The funeral's tomorrow.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.839
The department requests
all officers not on duty to attend.

04:57.214 --> 05:01.310
Any donations for the family
may be given to Cecil as usual.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.270
And I don't want to hear
any more talk about strike!

05:07.808 --> 05:11.028
We're not plumbers.
We're police officers.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.072
And police officers don't strike.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.111
Murphy, front and center.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.889
Hello, tiger.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.187
Hey, hey, hey!

05:53.436 --> 05:54.483
Oh, yes!

05:56.773 --> 06:00.118
Lewis, come here when you're finished
fucking around with your suspect.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.570
Get on your feet!

06:06.449 --> 06:08.827
This guy's gonna be
your new partner.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.413
Murphy, meet Lewis.
Show him the neighborhood.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.464
Glad to know you, Murphy.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.212
Pretty neat.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.798
I better drive until you
know your way around.

06:21.965 --> 06:25.265
I usually drive when I'm
breaking in a new partner.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.743
You really think
the old man is gonna be there?

06:48.825 --> 06:50.418
Why would they invite us?

06:50.493 --> 06:53.292
All division heads are
bringing their support teams.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.714
It's big.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.757
I figure they're green-lighting
Delta City.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.837
What, are you kidding?
They never do anything ahead of schedule.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.470
It's Jones. He's got the 209 series
online and now he wants to show off.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.391
That's a tough break, Bob.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.094
What? What?

07:07.177 --> 07:10.681
Well, ED 209 ran into serious
delays and cost overruns.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.858
The old man ordered a backup plan.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.810
<i>95th floor.
Have a nice day.</i>

07:14.893 --> 07:17.271
Probably just to
light a fire under Jones' ass.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.823
- Yeah?
- Old Bob here gets the assignment.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.024
Yeah.

07:21.316 --> 07:24.240
Nobody in Security Concepts
takes it seriously.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.615
It's a better plan. Fucking Jones! I'd
go straight to the Old Man if I could.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.950
Don't mess with Jones, man.
He'll make sushi out of you.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.082
Yeah, you better be careful, man.
I heard Jones is a real shark.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.879
- Who asked you, twerp?
- Bob.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.003
What about this police thing,
what's the problem?

07:37.082 --> 07:39.130
Their union's been bitching
ever since we took over.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.257
You know, the usual nonsense.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.462
We'll turn things around.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.845
Mmm-hmm. Good, very good.
Let's get started.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.308
Now, friends,

07:55.642 --> 07:59.738
I've had this dream
for more than a decade now.

08:01.106 --> 08:04.406
A dream which I've invited you all
to share with me.

08:05.860 --> 08:10.787
In six months, we begin construction
of Delta City.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.753
Where Old Detroit now stands.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.417
Old Detroit has a cancer.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.086
The cancer is crime.

08:23.545 --> 08:26.173
And it must be cut out before
we employ the 2 million workers

08:26.256 --> 08:28.350
that will breathe life
into this city again.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.517
Yes.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.977
Although shifts in the tax structure

08:36.057 --> 08:39.311
have created an economy
ideal for corporate growth,

08:39.436 --> 08:42.610
community services,
in this case law enforcement,

08:43.231 --> 08:44.733
have suffered.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.697
I think it's time we
gave something back.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.740
Dick.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.054
Take a close look
at the track record of this company.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.133
And you'll see that we have gambled
in markets

09:10.216 --> 09:12.765
traditionally regarded as nonprofit.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.524
Hospitals, prisons,
space exploration.

09:18.433 --> 09:21.312
I say good business
is where you find it.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.282
As you know, we've entered
into a contract with the city

09:26.357 --> 09:28.576
to run local law enforcement.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.909
But at Security Concepts,

09:31.988 --> 09:36.038
we believe an efficient police force
is only part of the solution.

09:36.451 --> 09:39.000
No. We need something more.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.381
We need a 24-hour-a-day
police officer.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.627
A cop that doesn't
need to eat or sleep.

09:46.169 --> 09:50.174
A cop with superior firepower
and the reflexes to use it.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.101
Fellow executives,

09:54.177 --> 09:58.853
it gives me great pleasure to introduce
you to the future of law enforcement.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.770
Ed 209.

10:40.890 --> 10:45.691
The Enforcement Droid series 209 is a
self-sufficient law enforcement robot.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.990
209 is currently programmed
for urban pacification,

10:49.065 --> 10:50.817
but that is only the beginning.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.995
After a successful tour of duty
in Old Detroit,

10:54.070 --> 10:58.871
we can expect 209 to become the hot
military product for the next decade.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.170
- Dr. McNamara.
- We'll need an arrest subject.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.497
- Mr. Kinney.
- Yes, sir?

11:03.580 --> 11:04.797
Would you come up
and give us a hand, please?

11:04.873 --> 11:06.170
Yes, sir.

11:06.249 --> 11:11.096
Mr. Kinney is going to help us simulate
a typical arrest and disarming procedure.

11:11.254 --> 11:14.428
Mr. Kinney, use your gun
in a threatening manner.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.762
- Point it at Ed 209.
- Yes, sir.

11:27.687 --> 11:32.113
<i>Please put down your weapon.
You have 20 seconds to comply.</i>

11:33.610 --> 11:36.784
I think you'd better do what he says,
Mr. Kinney.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.959
<i>You now have 15 seconds to comply.</i>

11:45.121 --> 11:47.215
<i>- You are in direct violation...
- Cut the power! Pull the board!</i>

11:47.290 --> 11:50.715
<i>of Penal Code 113, Section 9.</i>

11:50.793 --> 11:52.233
<i>You now have five seconds to comply.</i>

11:53.296 --> 11:54.388
Help! Help me!

11:54.464 --> 11:57.058
<i>Four, three, two, one.</i>

11:58.593 --> 12:01.563
<i>I am now authorized to
use physical force.</i>

12:26.329 --> 12:27.501
It's horrible.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.674
Somebody want to call
a goddamn paramedic?

12:29.749 --> 12:33.003
- Let's go, Johnson!
- You pull the plug on this thing!

12:34.295 --> 12:36.343
All right, don't touch him.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.266
Don't touch him!

12:38.341 --> 12:39.513
He didn't hear the gun drop.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.935
He didn't hear it?

12:42.011 --> 12:43.263
Oh, God.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.974
Dick, I'm very disappointed.

12:47.642 --> 12:50.521
I'm sure it's only a glitch,
a temporary setback.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.526
You call this a glitch?

12:54.315 --> 12:56.613
We're scheduled to begin construction
in six months.

12:56.693 --> 13:00.618
Your temporary setback could cost us $50
million in interest payments alone.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.415
Not necessarily, sir.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.288
Perhaps you're aware
of the Robocop program

13:04.367 --> 13:06.119
developed by myself
at Security Concepts

13:06.202 --> 13:08.296
as a contingency
against just this sort of thing.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.918
Thank you for your concern,
Mr. Morton.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.966
I'm sure this is something
we can take up in my office...

13:12.041 --> 13:13.042
Now, wait a minute. Dick!

13:13.209 --> 13:14.927
Get me out of here!

13:16.004 --> 13:19.099
Maybe what we need here
is a fresh perspective.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.303
Tell me about your plan, Mr. Morton.
How long will it take?

13:22.385 --> 13:23.386
We're ready to go, sir.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.142
We've restructured the
police department

13:25.221 --> 13:27.315
and placed prime candidates
according to risk factor.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.813
I'm confident that we can go
to prototype within 90 days.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.520
Good, very good.
Get your staff together, Mr. Morton.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.231
I'll expect a full presentation
in 20 minutes.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.400
Thank you, sir.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.913
Yes! Now, that's how it's done
in the big leagues, Johnson.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.461
You see an opening, you go for it.

13:49.287 --> 13:52.757
You better watch your back, Bob.
Jones is going to come looking for you.

13:52.874 --> 13:56.754
Fuck Jones. He fumbled the ball
and I was there to pick it up.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.263
Too bad about Kinney.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.633
That's life in the big city.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.268
When do we start?

14:04.344 --> 14:07.063
As soon as
some poor schmuck volunteers.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.058
<i>Unit 3509, proceed to Hall and Grand.</i>

14:10.141 --> 14:12.018
<i>411 involving indigents.</i>

14:12.101 --> 14:14.445
<i>Roger, we're on our way.</i>

14:24.072 --> 14:26.291
Pretty fancy moves, Murphy.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.791
Yeah, my son, Jimmy,
watches this cop show, <i>TJ Lazer,</i>

14:29.869 --> 14:32.839
and this Lazer guy does this
every time he takes down a bad guy.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.292
So naturally, my kid thinks
every good cop should be...

14:35.375 --> 14:37.298
And you don't want to disappoint him.

14:38.086 --> 14:42.011
Yeah, well, role models
can be very important to a boy.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.891
Okay, okay, I get a kick out of it.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.067
<i>All units,
all units, sector 9.</i>

14:53.142 --> 14:54.985
- That's for...
<i>- 211 in progress.</i>

14:55.478 --> 14:57.151
Why don't you drive?

14:57.814 --> 15:01.068
<i>the suspects are armed
and considered dangerous.</i>

15:03.653 --> 15:04.870
CLARENCE; Shit.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.786
I don't believe it!

15:07.865 --> 15:08.957
What?

15:09.033 --> 15:11.252
You burned the fucking money!

15:11.327 --> 15:13.375
I had to blow the door.
What do you want?

15:13.454 --> 15:15.456
It's as good as marked, you asshole!

15:15.540 --> 15:17.918
You stupid, stupid asshole!

15:18.000 --> 15:20.594
- Clarence!
- What? What do you want?

15:20.670 --> 15:22.343
We got a cop on our tail.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.438
Come on, man, speed it up! Move it!

15:31.514 --> 15:33.687
This crate ain't gonna outrun a cop.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.360
- Slow down, then.
- What, are you crazy, man?

15:36.436 --> 15:39.360
Shut the fuck up and do it!
Just do it!

15:39.439 --> 15:42.318
Central, this is 154.
We're in pursuit of 211 suspect.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.572
Request backup.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.536
<i>Roger, 154.</i>

15:45.611 --> 15:48.205
<i>- Backup currently unavailable.</i>
- Give me your piece.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.784
<i>Backup E.T.A., 15 minutes.</i>

15:51.033 --> 15:52.455
Bobby, get the door!

15:52.702 --> 15:53.794
Everybody load up!

15:53.870 --> 15:55.622
All right, let's go. Come on!

15:55.872 --> 15:58.250
- Okay.
- All right, here we go.

16:03.546 --> 16:04.593
Now.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.969
What the fuck?
Where did he go?

16:10.052 --> 16:11.178
Emil?

16:11.262 --> 16:12.639
Here! He's up here!

16:16.893 --> 16:18.145
He's on the side.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.729
He's over here!

16:27.069 --> 16:28.116
Get him!

16:36.621 --> 16:38.043
Shit, Clarence, my leg!

16:38.122 --> 16:40.375
Leon, pick him up.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.502
- Ready?
- No, hang on.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.637
Bobby.

16:46.214 --> 16:48.512
- Can you fly, Bobby?
- Clarence, no!

16:48.883 --> 16:50.100
Hit it!

16:52.053 --> 16:53.726
No!

17:15.617 --> 17:16.835
Central, this is unit 154.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.505
We located that van by
the old mill in Sector 3D.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.924
<i>- Now, where is that backup?
- Backup is still unavailable.</i>

17:22.083 --> 17:23.425
Oh, man!

17:23.501 --> 17:26.253
<i>We estimate 10 minutes
before units can arrive.</i>

17:27.505 --> 17:28.757
Well, you call it.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.260
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

17:39.267 --> 17:40.268
Go.

17:41.352 --> 17:42.604
Stay in touch.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.571
Freeze.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.952
Okay, let's see those hands.

18:31.736 --> 18:33.158
Nice and easy.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.114
Sure.

18:35.489 --> 18:38.288
Mind if I zip this up?

18:57.637 --> 19:00.436
We keep robbing banks,
but we never get to keep the money.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.936
Takes money to make money.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.188
We steal money to buy coke,

19:03.267 --> 19:05.486
then sell the coke
to make even more money.

19:05.561 --> 19:06.608
Capital investment, man.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.361
Yeah, why bother making it
when we can just steal it?

19:09.440 --> 19:12.114
Ain't no better way to
steal money than free enterprise.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.615
- Smoke?
- No.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.197
- You know, those things will kill you.
- Yeah.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.908
You want to live forever?

19:19.742 --> 19:20.868
<i>Bixby!</i>

19:24.830 --> 19:27.879
<i>What a cake! Oh, boy!</i>

19:31.212 --> 19:32.213
Hey.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.049
Don't move.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.138
Go ahead and do it.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.561
Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.741
<i>Lewis. Lewis!</i>

19:54.902 --> 19:56.779
Lewis, I got a situation here, girl.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.240
Okay, tough guy, get up.
Get up!

19:59.323 --> 20:01.701
Turn around.
Spread your legs. That's right.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.254
<i>Lewis, where are you?
You all right?</i>

20:07.248 --> 20:09.671
Put your hands on your head.
Lewis?

20:13.963 --> 20:16.591
Why don't you let us
take over from here, Emil?

20:35.401 --> 20:37.870
- Your ass is mine.
- No.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.366
Not yet it ain't.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.300
Well, what have we here?

20:57.965 --> 21:00.343
You a good cop, hotshot?

21:02.428 --> 21:04.146
Sure you are.

21:04.680 --> 21:10.187
Why, you got to be some kind of great
cop to come in here all by yourself.

21:15.149 --> 21:16.822
Where's your partner?

21:16.901 --> 21:18.323
Where's your partner?

21:18.402 --> 21:21.030
Well, guys, the other
one was upstairs.

21:21.238 --> 21:25.163
She was sweet, mmm, mmm, mmm.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.703
I took her out.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.467
I bet that really pisses you off.

21:39.256 --> 21:42.100
You probably don't think
I'm a very nice guy.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.768
Do you?

21:44.178 --> 21:45.851
Buddy, I think you're slime.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.520
You see, I got this problem.

21:53.187 --> 21:57.909
Cops don't like me,
so I don't like cops.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.381
Well, give the man a hand.

22:19.547 --> 22:21.094
He's all yours.

22:35.563 --> 22:38.362
- All right, look out.
- Turn around, man.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.738
Pretty boy, over here.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.177
Shit! I'm out of ammo.

23:02.256 --> 23:03.473
Me, too.

23:08.429 --> 23:11.023
Hey Clarence, he's still alive.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.940
Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?

23:21.901 --> 23:24.120
Okay, fun's over.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.452
Okay, let's get out of here.

23:33.287 --> 23:35.085
Good night, sweet prince.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.588
Hey, wait up, wait up, wait up.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.401
Murphy.

24:25.923 --> 24:27.300
Get him over. Lift!

24:29.510 --> 24:30.932
Get the ventilator.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.684
Put him in OR 4.

24:38.102 --> 24:39.820
Easy, easy. Turn.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.609
Slow it down now.
Slow it down, slow it down.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.319
Okay, hit the door.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.199
Let me get pressure.

24:52.282 --> 24:53.534
Mask him.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.412
Got a pressure of 60 palp.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.336
All right, we have to
intubate this guy.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.466
Apply cricoid pressure.

25:02.209 --> 25:05.713
Okay. All right, I got it in.
Breath sounds.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.011
- You're in.
- Other side.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.636
Okay, let's go ahead
and get the MAST trousers up.

25:11.719 --> 25:12.999
Let's get the clothes off.

25:13.012 --> 25:16.016
Okay, clothes off.
Let's prep him for a central line.

25:16.098 --> 25:19.193
Let's get some blood drawn.
Type and crossing, six units.

25:23.647 --> 25:24.887
<i>His pressure's dropping.</i>

25:24.898 --> 25:26.992
<i>Okay,
I've got a central line in.</i>

25:27.067 --> 25:28.785
<i>I'm getting pressure back.
Normal saline.</i>

25:28.861 --> 25:30.033
Can you do that, Dad?

25:33.949 --> 25:35.622
I really have to tell you something.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.982
<i>- What's our blood pressure?
- I've got 40 palp.</i>

25:38.037 --> 25:39.380
<i>All right.</i>

25:46.378 --> 25:48.472
Coarse V-Fib.
Okay, we got to shock him.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.220
Let's get the Ambu bag.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.972
Clear the patches.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.810
Put the Foley in.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.014
Let's go ahead and blow
his MAST trousers.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.268
Stand clear.

25:57.347 --> 25:59.270
Stand clear. Shock him.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.692
<i>All right.</i>

26:01.268 --> 26:03.646
Coarse V-Fib.
Let's shock him again.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.235
Clear.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.112
<i>All right.</i>

26:08.192 --> 26:10.991
Flatline. Let's go
intracardiac epinephrine.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.367
Let's go.

26:12.446 --> 26:13.743
Okay.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.330
All right, it's in.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.535
There's no pulse.

26:18.619 --> 26:21.589
All right, let's go ahead and
shock a flat line, and let's quit.

26:21.663 --> 26:22.863
Okay, everybody, clear!

26:22.873 --> 26:23.920
Stand clear.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.850
All right,
I think that's all we can do.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.144
Let's call it. What's the time?

26:36.512 --> 26:37.809
6:15.

26:53.695 --> 26:54.867
Sharp.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.291
No, it's starting to roll.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.123
Still rolling.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.954
- Shit!
- Nope.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.333
Let me see.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.085
Bring in the L.E.D.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.129
Let's lock it down.

27:18.303 --> 27:19.805
- He's on.
- What's the story?

27:19.888 --> 27:21.561
We were able to save the left arm.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.519
What? I thought we agreed
on total body prosthesis.

27:24.601 --> 27:27.320
- Now, lose the arm, okay?
- Jesus, Morton.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.574
Can he understand what I'm saying?

27:30.649 --> 27:32.947
It doesn't matter.
We're gonna blank his memory, anyway.

27:33.026 --> 27:35.620
Well, I think we should lose the arm.
What do you think, Johnson?

27:35.696 --> 27:37.915
Well, he signed the release forms
when he joined the force.

27:37.990 --> 27:41.369
He's legally dead.
We can do pretty much what we want to.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.504
Lose the arm.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.674
Shut him down.
Prep him for surgery.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.681
The entire outer skin
will be like this.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.884
It's titanium laminated with Kevlar.

27:56.967 --> 27:59.015
Go ahead. Shake his hand.

28:00.804 --> 28:03.023
Come here often? How you doing?

28:04.391 --> 28:05.984
Oh, God!

28:07.519 --> 28:08.987
He's got a hell of a grip.

28:09.062 --> 28:13.112
It's 400 foot-pounds.
He could crush every bone in your hand.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.570
All right. Attach it to his shoulder.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.199
I like that.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.712
You are gonna be a bad motherfucker.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.343
Hey, look, look!
He's watching us!

28:35.422 --> 28:36.765
How you doing?

28:36.840 --> 28:38.308
- Hi!
- Hi!

28:40.719 --> 28:41.971
Happy new year!

28:42.054 --> 28:43.306
This is for you.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.980
Happy new year.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.822
We get the best of both worlds.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.404
The fastest reflexes
modern technology has to offer,

28:58.487 --> 29:00.239
on board computer-assisted memory,

29:00.322 --> 29:03.496
and a lifetime of on-the-street
law enforcement programming.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.704
It is my great pleasure
to present to you,

29:08.413 --> 29:09.665
Robocop.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.462
Come on, come on, COME on.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.593
Come on. That's for you.
That's for you.

29:17.673 --> 29:18.925
Go, Robo.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.203
I am what you call
a repeat offender.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.623
I repeat, I will offend again.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.951
I get my orders from
a higher source.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.285
Shut up, asshole.

29:46.368 --> 29:49.042
Does your mother know
you talk like that?

29:51.581 --> 29:52.878
Bring him in through the side door.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.756
This holding cell has been
set up for observation.

29:54.835 --> 29:55.836
Looks perfect.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.639
- What is this all about?
- Who is this guy?

29:57.671 --> 29:59.514
- Sergeant John Reed.
- What's this all about?

29:59.589 --> 30:03.139
It's about official OCP business.
So please, get lost.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.845
I think we've got four
or five days setup...

30:04.928 --> 30:08.307
Hey, this is bullshit!
I take my orders from...

30:25.449 --> 30:27.417
What is this shit?

30:27.743 --> 30:28.983
Yeah, good question.

30:29.536 --> 30:32.585
- Hey, wait for me, partner.
- Let's go.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.503
There they are.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.001
Go.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.816
When you are at rest,
you will sit in the chair.

30:50.891 --> 30:52.609
<i>Yes. I understand.</i>

30:52.976 --> 30:54.353
What about tracking?

30:54.478 --> 30:57.027
We can check his exact location
at all times with one of these.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.196
How does he eat?

31:00.275 --> 31:02.403
His digestive system
is extremely simple.

31:02.486 --> 31:04.534
This processor dispenses
a rudimentary paste

31:04.613 --> 31:06.911
that sustains his organic system.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.799
Tastes like baby food.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.049
Knock yourself out.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.222
Mmm.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.649
Okay, let's start with tracking.

31:32.724 --> 31:33.816
- Give me a grid.
- Got it.

31:33.892 --> 31:34.939
There.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.065
- Target?
- Check.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.481
- Target.
- Check.

31:38.563 --> 31:39.906
Now follow.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.243
Check.

31:44.611 --> 31:47.831
Voice stress analyzer,
one, two...

31:47.906 --> 31:48.998
Ahhh.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.291
- ...three.
- Ahhh.

31:50.367 --> 31:51.334
- Check.
- Record.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.411
Ahhh.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.288
- Now playback.
- Bring it up 50%.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.007
<i>- Now playback.
- Bring it up 50%.</i>

31:57.082 --> 31:58.254
<i>Give me a full frame.</i>

31:58.333 --> 32:00.085
- We got it.
- All right, clear out.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.547
What are your prime directives?

32:04.131 --> 32:08.261
<i>Serve the public trust, protect
the innocent, uphold the law.</i>

32:11.930 --> 32:13.273
That's good.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.017
That's very good.

32:17.853 --> 32:18.900
Huh?

32:24.025 --> 32:25.402
I fucking love that guy!

33:03.231 --> 33:04.733
Hey, Lewis, it's Supercop.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.784
Look at that fucking gun.

33:22.667 --> 33:23.793
Shit!

33:24.753 --> 33:27.597
- This guy's really good.
- He's not a guy. He's a machine.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.595
What are they gonna do, replace us?

33:37.224 --> 33:38.476
Come on.

33:43.813 --> 33:45.156
- Reed.
- Yeah?

33:45.232 --> 33:46.609
He needs a car.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.737
<i>Thank you.</i>

33:50.820 --> 33:52.868
Sure. Anytime.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.743
Oh, yeah. Go get 'em, boy!

34:29.985 --> 34:32.033
<i>I'd buy that for a dollar!</i>

34:45.583 --> 34:47.552
Will there be anything else, sir?

34:47.627 --> 34:50.255
Yeah, empty the register
and put the money in the bag.

34:50.338 --> 34:51.681
Excuse me?

34:52.047 --> 34:55.598
I said give me your money and all
of it, and don't fuck with me!

34:55.677 --> 34:56.929
Now move!

34:57.929 --> 34:59.397
Open the safe, Pops.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.267
Open the goddamn safe!

35:02.350 --> 35:03.897
We don't have a safe.

35:03.977 --> 35:07.823
Shit! There's your goddamn safe!
Open that son of a bitch!

35:07.897 --> 35:09.774
Quit stalling, man!
I'm gonna count to three!

35:09.858 --> 35:11.201
You better open that son of a bitch.

35:11.276 --> 35:12.744
Come on! Come on!

35:12.819 --> 35:14.867
I'm gonna blow her brains out.

35:16.323 --> 35:18.997
- I'll open the safe.
- Good boy.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.334
Come on.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.376
Well, you better open that
on the count of three.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.583
One, two...

35:28.293 --> 35:29.670
Fuck me.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.722
<i>Drop the gun.
You are under arrest.</i>

35:34.424 --> 35:35.391
Fuck me! Fuck me!

35:35.467 --> 35:38.596
Fuck me! Fuck me!

35:39.304 --> 35:41.932
Fuck me! Fuck me!

35:42.641 --> 35:43.858
Fuck me!

35:54.653 --> 35:57.782
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.
Good night.</i>

35:58.823 --> 36:01.167
<i>I'll buy that for a dollar!</i>

36:18.677 --> 36:21.396
Don't touch me!
Get away! Get away!

36:21.471 --> 36:23.064
We don't want your bag!

36:23.181 --> 36:24.603
We want you!

36:26.726 --> 36:29.821
Take it easy!
We don't want to hurt you!

36:29.896 --> 36:30.943
That's too much hair.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.366
I know, we'll give her a haircut!

36:37.237 --> 36:38.454
- Hey, hey.
- What?

36:38.530 --> 36:41.625
There's more hair down there!

36:44.244 --> 36:46.121
No, don't!

36:48.998 --> 36:50.215
Please!

36:51.000 --> 36:52.217
No!

36:52.502 --> 36:53.754
Help me!

36:54.671 --> 36:56.389
Help me!

36:57.132 --> 36:59.510
<i>Let the woman go.
You are under arrest.</i>

36:59.592 --> 37:00.718
Shit!

37:01.803 --> 37:03.396
You better back up, pal!

37:03.471 --> 37:05.394
'Cause, he's gonna kill her!

37:05.473 --> 37:07.271
He's gonna kill her!

37:07.350 --> 37:09.227
You fucking bitch!

37:09.310 --> 37:11.153
He's gonna kill her, man!

37:11.229 --> 37:13.106
He's gonna kill her!

37:21.489 --> 37:23.116
<i>Your move, creep.</i>

37:23.199 --> 37:24.371
Okay!

37:25.076 --> 37:26.293
It's okay!

37:31.750 --> 37:34.879
I was so scared. Thank you.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.596
Thank you.

37:38.590 --> 37:41.218
<i>Madam, you have suffered
an emotional shock.</i>

37:41.301 --> 37:43.850
<i>I will notify a rape crisis center.</i>

37:55.440 --> 37:58.819
<i>All units, Sector 6,
please close intersections...</i>

38:05.200 --> 38:07.373
I don't care.
Get those men by the stairs now!

38:07.452 --> 38:08.704
Hit it!

38:11.414 --> 38:14.543
Terrorism has never been
a factor in city politics before.

38:14.626 --> 38:17.505
But that changed today
when former city councilman Ron Miller

38:17.587 --> 38:19.260
entered City Hall with a gun.

38:19.339 --> 38:20.716
He's now on the second floor

38:20.799 --> 38:23.393
holding Mayor Gibson
and his staff hostage.

38:23.468 --> 38:27.314
We do believe that Miller has
killed one of the hostages.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.433
Lieutenant, what's next?

38:29.516 --> 38:31.689
We wait. Terrorism
is a very tricky business.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.896
Maximum and immediate retaliation
is the best policy.

38:33.978 --> 38:34.979
But unfortunately...

38:36.147 --> 38:37.194
Excuse us.

38:37.273 --> 38:39.071
Where are you going?

38:41.486 --> 38:42.829
Statement, please.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.795
Let's have some crowd control!
Come on, get these people back!

38:50.870 --> 38:52.713
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

38:52.789 --> 38:54.541
<i>Keep him talking.</i>

38:58.127 --> 38:59.504
Who made you?

39:00.171 --> 39:01.969
Are you invincible?

39:05.718 --> 39:09.939
<i>Okay, Miller, don't hurt the Mayor.
We'll give you whatever you want.</i>

39:10.223 --> 39:13.727
First, don't fuck with me!
I'm a desperate man!

39:14.853 --> 39:17.606
And second,
I want some fresh coffee!

39:18.565 --> 39:20.567
And third, I want a recount!

39:20.650 --> 39:23.995
And no matter how it turns out,
I want my old job back!

39:24.070 --> 39:25.287
<i>Okay.</i>

39:25.363 --> 39:27.457
And I want a bigger office!

39:27.949 --> 39:29.701
And I want a new car!

39:29.784 --> 39:31.627
And I want the City
to pay for it all!

39:31.703 --> 39:33.922
<i>What kind of car, Miller?</i>

39:33.997 --> 39:35.965
Something with reclining
leather seats,

39:36.040 --> 39:38.964
that goes really fast and gets
really shitty gas mileage!

39:39.043 --> 39:42.047
<i>How about the 6000 SUX?</i>

39:42.797 --> 39:45.391
Yeah! Okay, sure!

39:47.051 --> 39:50.271
What about cruise control?
Does it come with cruise control?

39:50.346 --> 39:55.273
<i>Hey, no problem, Miller. Let the Mayor
go, we 'll even throw in a Blaupunkt.</i>

39:57.103 --> 39:59.322
Lieutenant, don't jerk me off!

39:59.397 --> 40:02.321
When people jerk me off,
I kill them!

40:02.400 --> 40:04.027
You want to see?

40:08.573 --> 40:10.996
Get up, Your Honor,
get up. Get up!

40:11.075 --> 40:12.668
Your public wants to see you!

40:14.495 --> 40:16.668
Nobody ever takes me seriously!

40:17.498 --> 40:19.296
We'll get serious now!

40:19.375 --> 40:21.469
And kiss the Mayor's ass good-bye!

40:32.972 --> 40:35.066
<i>Robocop.
Who is he?</i>

40:35.141 --> 40:37.610
<i>What is he?
Where does he come from?</i>

40:37.810 --> 40:40.029
<i>He's OCP's newest soldier</i>

40:40.104 --> 40:42.573
<i>in their revolutionary
crime management program.</i>

40:42.649 --> 40:45.198
<i>OCP Spokesmen claim
that the fearless machine</i>

40:45.276 --> 40:47.370
<i>has crooks on the
run in Old Detroit.</i>

40:47.445 --> 40:49.868
<i>Today, kids at Lee lacocca
Elementary School</i>

40:49.948 --> 40:51.291
<i>got to meet in person</i>

40:51.366 --> 40:54.245
<i>what their parents only
read about in comic books.</i>

40:54.327 --> 40:56.705
<i>Robe, excuse me, Robo.</i>
<i>Any special message</i>

40:56.788 --> 40:58.790
<i>for all the kids watching at home?</i>

41:00.291 --> 41:02.134
<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

41:03.294 --> 41:05.547
<i>More fighting in the
Mexican crisis today</i>

41:05.630 --> 41:08.133
<i>when American troops
participated in a joint raid</i>

41:08.216 --> 41:09.308
<i>with Mexican nationals</i>

41:09.384 --> 41:12.012
<i>against rebel rocket
positions in Acapulco.</i>

41:12.637 --> 41:13.638
<i>Now this.</i>

41:13.721 --> 41:16.270
<i>Red alert.
Red alert. Red alert.</i>

41:17.517 --> 41:19.986
<i>You crossed my line of death.</i>

41:20.061 --> 41:22.405
<i>You haven't dismantled
your MX stockpile.</i>

41:22.480 --> 41:24.528
<i>Pakistan is threatening my border.</i>

41:24.607 --> 41:27.326
<i>That's it, buster.
No more military aid.</i>

41:30.321 --> 41:32.949
<i>Nukem, get them
before they get you.</i>

41:37.203 --> 41:39.922
<i>Today, labor leaders agreed
to sanction construction</i>

41:39.998 --> 41:41.545
<i>of OCP's Delta City,</i>

41:41.624 --> 41:44.844
<i>thereby creating an estimated one
million much-needed new jobs,</i>

41:44.919 --> 41:48.674
<i>despite questions about worker
safety in dangerous Old Detroit.</i>

41:48.756 --> 41:52.386
<i>Robert Morton, vice president,
Security Concepts, OCP.</i>

41:52.468 --> 41:54.562
<i>I'm afraid I can't
comment on Delta City.</i>

41:54.637 --> 41:56.184
<i>That's not my division.
But I will tell you this.</i>

41:56.556 --> 41:59.355
<i>At Security Concepts,
we 're projecting the end of crime</i>

41:59.559 --> 42:01.778
<i>in Old Detroit within 40 days.</i>

42:02.311 --> 42:04.905
<i>There's a new guy in town.
His name's Robocop.</i>

42:08.109 --> 42:11.704
Hey, hey, hey. Bobby boy.
Vice president. Congratulations.

42:11.779 --> 42:12.996
Handball Tuesday night?

42:13.072 --> 42:15.495
Bill, I'd love to.
But I got a date.

42:15.575 --> 42:17.794
Couple models coming over to
my place. Know what I mean?

42:17.869 --> 42:19.746
I'd buy that for a dollar.

42:23.332 --> 42:25.005
Welcome to the club, Bob.

42:26.586 --> 42:28.213
and that's a true story.

42:29.130 --> 42:32.851
Making a real name for yourself
in Security Concepts with Robocop.

42:32.925 --> 42:34.393
I try.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.475
I'm in on the bottom line, pal.

42:36.554 --> 42:39.103
I hear Jones was plenty pissed.

42:39.182 --> 42:42.686
Oh, you know, he's got this killer
rep, but it's a smokescreen.

42:44.145 --> 42:46.819
Let's face it, he's lost his teeth.
The guy's a pussy.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.650
Are we talking
about the same Dick Jones?

42:48.733 --> 42:51.862
Hey, he's old,
we're young, and that's life.

43:01.621 --> 43:03.794
I got to...

43:04.582 --> 43:06.755
I got to go.
I got a meeting.

43:17.386 --> 43:18.683
Congratulations, Bob.

43:19.639 --> 43:20.856
Thanks.

43:21.641 --> 43:25.066
I remember when I was
a young executive for this company.

43:25.645 --> 43:27.943
I used to call the
old man funny names.

43:28.523 --> 43:29.570
Iron Butt,

43:30.608 --> 43:31.700
Boner.

43:33.027 --> 43:36.622
Once, I even called him asshole.

43:42.537 --> 43:44.460
But there was always respect.

43:45.373 --> 43:48.092
I always knew where
the line was drawn.

43:49.794 --> 43:52.843
And you just stepped over it,
buddy boy.

43:54.215 --> 43:58.015
You've insulted me,
and you've insulted this company

43:58.094 --> 43:59.596
with that bastard creation of yours!

43:59.679 --> 44:03.058
I had a guaranteed military
sale with Ed 209!

44:03.141 --> 44:07.021
Renovation program.
Spare parts for 25 years.

44:07.103 --> 44:09.731
Who cares if it worked or not?

44:11.315 --> 44:13.613
The old man thought
it was pretty important,

44:13.734 --> 44:14.826
Dick.

44:22.702 --> 44:26.457
You know, he's a sweet old man.

44:29.792 --> 44:31.339
And he means well.

44:33.254 --> 44:35.598
But he's not going to live forever.

44:37.550 --> 44:39.678
And I'm number two around here.

44:41.179 --> 44:43.352
Pretty simple math, huh, Bob?

44:45.683 --> 44:47.856
You just

44:49.020 --> 44:51.523
fucked with the wrong guy.

44:51.606 --> 44:53.904
You're out of your fucking mind.

44:59.155 --> 45:00.828
You better pray

45:01.616 --> 45:04.961
that that unholy monster of yours
doesn't screw up.

45:24.430 --> 45:26.979
- You hungry?
- No, thanks.

46:09.433 --> 46:10.525
No.

46:15.982 --> 46:18.861
Goddamn rebels blew up the airport
in Acapulco yesterday.

46:18.943 --> 46:21.822
Great. We were going there next week.
Wait, what was that?

46:28.160 --> 46:30.583
Hey, look!
Bucket boy's online.

46:48.389 --> 46:51.518
Halt. Stop! Wait a minute!

46:51.934 --> 46:53.356
What the hell's going on?

46:53.436 --> 46:55.939
- I don't know. He just left.
- Just left?

46:57.648 --> 46:58.991
Roosevelt!

46:59.817 --> 47:01.819
Rosie, we got a problem.

47:04.488 --> 47:06.456
Out of the way!

47:06.824 --> 47:08.622
Take a look at this.

47:11.662 --> 47:13.505
Shit! Call Bob Morton!

47:23.632 --> 47:26.636
Jerry, book him.
I'll catch up with you later.

47:31.724 --> 47:35.524
Hello. I haven't really had a chance
to introduce myself.

47:36.062 --> 47:37.609
I'm Anne Lewis.

47:39.190 --> 47:40.942
Do you have a name?

47:47.406 --> 47:49.875
<i>How can I help you,
Officer Lewis?</i>

47:51.410 --> 47:55.040
That's not really what I meant.
Don't you have a name?

47:55.414 --> 47:56.961
Hold it.
Just sign right here, sir.

47:57.041 --> 47:58.668
You don't understand.
I'm OCP.

48:00.169 --> 48:02.592
Murphy, it's you.

48:07.968 --> 48:10.346
You really don't remember me,
do you?

48:10.429 --> 48:11.772
<i>Excuse me.</i>

48:12.181 --> 48:13.649
<i>I have to go.</i>

48:14.225 --> 48:16.478
<i>Somewhere there is
a crime happening.</i>

48:16.560 --> 48:17.652
Stop!

48:19.230 --> 48:21.824
What did you talk to him about?
What did you say?

48:21.899 --> 48:23.321
- Nothing.
- Shit.

48:23.401 --> 48:24.493
Shit.

48:27.363 --> 48:28.489
Stop!

48:28.572 --> 48:30.199
You there, stop!

48:35.871 --> 48:39.375
You're in a lot of trouble, Officer!
Come on!

48:41.085 --> 48:43.838
I was assured full cooperation
by this precinct, buddy,

48:43.921 --> 48:45.801
and if it gets screwed up
by one of your grunts,

48:45.881 --> 48:46.973
I'm gonna have your job.

48:47.049 --> 48:48.847
- What's the update?
- It's hard to be 100%.

48:48.926 --> 48:49.973
We have a glitch or what?

48:50.052 --> 48:52.852
This system was never designed to
experience detailed somatic response.

48:52.930 --> 48:54.807
He had a dream, a dream.

48:55.099 --> 48:58.148
- This cop saw fit to question him.
- I didn't question him.

48:58.227 --> 49:00.400
I asked him his name.
He didn't know.

49:00.479 --> 49:03.323
Great.
Let me make it real clear for you.

49:03.399 --> 49:05.777
He doesn't have a name.
He's got a program.

49:05.860 --> 49:08.079
He's product. Is that clear?

49:08.446 --> 49:09.493
Sure.

49:09.572 --> 49:11.415
I say we pull him in, run a
systems check, the works.

49:11.490 --> 49:12.707
Take a week.
Maybe 10 days.

49:12.783 --> 49:14.877
You want to take him offline
because he had a dream?

49:14.952 --> 49:16.204
What, are you kidding?

49:16.454 --> 49:18.252
Let's get out of here.

49:18.664 --> 49:19.756
- Listen, Reed.
- Yeah?

49:19.832 --> 49:23.803
Try to keep one thing in mind.
This project doesn't concern cops.

49:23.878 --> 49:26.427
It's classified.
It's OCP.

49:26.714 --> 49:28.466
You got it, mister?

49:31.177 --> 49:32.724
Yeah, I got it.

49:33.137 --> 49:34.229
Good.

49:34.930 --> 49:36.432
Right, we keep him on the street...

49:36.515 --> 49:37.983
Sorry, Sarge.

49:38.684 --> 49:40.106
I fucked up.

49:42.062 --> 49:44.611
Forget it, kid.
This guy's a serious asshole.

50:17.348 --> 50:20.522
Give me all your money, bookworm,
or I blow your brains out.

50:26.690 --> 50:28.613
Now fill it up on number 7.

50:34.782 --> 50:37.001
Don't do nothing stupid, man.

50:39.203 --> 50:40.500
I'm a good shot.

50:43.249 --> 50:44.922
I could hit you in the eye from here.

50:56.762 --> 50:59.231
Hey, man, what
you reading in there?

51:05.354 --> 51:08.233
You a college boy or something?

51:10.234 --> 51:12.783
I bet you think you're pretty smart?

51:13.237 --> 51:15.490
Think you could outsmart a bullet?

51:15.656 --> 51:17.784
What do you say we find out?

51:18.367 --> 51:20.369
I'm talking to you!
What do you say?

51:22.037 --> 51:23.755
I'm talking to you!

51:25.874 --> 51:27.091
<i>Drop it.</i>

51:31.171 --> 51:33.799
<i>Dead or alive,
you are coming with me.</i>

51:37.928 --> 51:39.305
I know you.

51:40.931 --> 51:41.932
You're dead.

51:43.225 --> 51:44.727
We killed you!

51:46.020 --> 51:47.397
We killed you!

51:50.024 --> 51:51.526
We killed you!

52:02.870 --> 52:04.122
<i>You're dead.</i>

52:05.039 --> 52:06.211
<i>We killed you!</i>

52:51.794 --> 52:53.262
<i>Who are you?</i>

52:56.048 --> 52:58.392
<i>Who are you?</i>

53:11.188 --> 53:12.781
Jerry, Jerry.
Look who it is.

53:12.856 --> 53:14.574
Can I help you, sir?

53:15.150 --> 53:18.404
<i>- No.</i>
- What is it exactly that you want?

53:20.322 --> 53:23.371
You can't enter here!
Wait a second!

53:23.450 --> 53:25.043
Just a minute!

53:25.536 --> 53:28.460
This is a restricted area!

53:36.880 --> 53:37.927
He's in.

54:34.354 --> 54:36.698
<i>Murphy, it's you.</i>

54:36.774 --> 54:38.868
<i>Murphy, it's you.</i>

54:38.942 --> 54:41.365
<i>Murphy, it's you.</i>

54:41.445 --> 54:43.948
<i>Murphy, it's you.</i>

55:39.837 --> 55:41.009
<i>Welcome, shopper.</i>

55:41.088 --> 55:43.682
<i>Let's take a stroll through
your new home.</i>

55:43.757 --> 55:46.977
<i>This is a one-family house
built by ZEM Industries.</i>

55:47.052 --> 55:49.271
<i>Situated near schools
and shopping centers,</i>

55:49.346 --> 55:52.771
<i>this progressive development
has a growth factor of 7.</i>

56:14.663 --> 56:15.880
Wow.

56:17.207 --> 56:18.800
Can you do that, Dad?

56:28.010 --> 56:30.934
<i>and, say, it doesn't
matter who cooks in your family,</i>

56:31.013 --> 56:35.644
<i>because this kitchen by Food
Concepts makes everything a snap.</i>

56:55.579 --> 56:56.626
Dad.

57:01.585 --> 57:03.428
Come on, Dad.
Come on, Dad.

57:03.503 --> 57:04.800
Get in the picture.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.177
Come on, come on.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.863
I really have to tell you something.

57:29.696 --> 57:31.073
I love you.

57:36.328 --> 57:38.126
<i>That's the master bedroom.</i>

57:38.205 --> 57:42.426
<i>A functional space
with a touch of elegance.</i>

57:42.626 --> 57:44.799
<i>Have you thought it all over?</i>

57:45.087 --> 57:47.089
<i>Why not make me an offer?</i>

58:20.080 --> 58:22.253
<i>Where is Clarence Boddicker?</i>

58:28.630 --> 58:29.677
Okay?

58:36.722 --> 58:38.520
- Shit!
<i>- Let's talk.</i>

58:43.270 --> 58:45.022
Son of a bitch!

58:49.568 --> 58:51.991
There's just something
about the way it sounds.

58:53.488 --> 58:54.910
Vice president.

58:55.699 --> 58:57.747
It just turns me on.

58:58.368 --> 58:59.870
God, you girls are so great.

58:59.953 --> 59:02.672
I mean I just...
I love to be with intelligent women.

59:02.748 --> 59:05.297
Smart is so sexy.

59:05.876 --> 59:07.173
I know.

59:07.377 --> 59:09.800
Sometimes I could
just think of something,

59:10.380 --> 59:14.010
and it could just get me so horny.

59:15.802 --> 59:19.181
Yeah, well, a mind is a
terrible thing to waste.

59:19.264 --> 59:20.641
Yeah.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.522
I get bored so easily.

59:24.061 --> 59:25.108
Yep.

59:25.604 --> 59:28.323
And you need lots of stimulation,
Bobby.

59:30.233 --> 59:33.282
- Yes, I do. Don't move.
- I won't.

59:36.615 --> 59:37.912
Bob?

59:38.742 --> 59:39.868
What?

59:40.243 --> 59:43.463
- Bob, save some for me.
- Don't worry. I'll...

59:47.375 --> 59:49.798
Must be the champagne.
Stay here.

59:56.134 --> 59:57.431
How you doing...

59:59.805 --> 01:00:01.352
Bitches, leave.

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:06.061
Gee, Bobby. Bye.

01:00:06.895 --> 01:00:09.569
- You gonna call me?
- Come on.

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:11.867
What the fuck are you doing?

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:13.660
Do you know who I am?

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:16.496
If you think you're gonna
get away with this...

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:20.955
Goddamn it!

01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:26.730
Stop! I'll give you
anything you want!

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:29.489
Just please, please don't
kill me, all right?

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.930
<i>Hello, buddy boy.
Dick Jones here.</i>

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:42.147
<i>I guess you're on your knees about
now, begging for your life.</i>

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:44.979
<i>Pathetic.</i>

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:47.398
<i>You don't feel so cocky now,
do you, Bob?</i>

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:50.481
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll double it right now.

01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:53.233
<i>You know what the
tragedy is here, Bob?</i>

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:57.074
<i>We could have been friends.</i>

01:00:57.154 --> 01:01:00.158
<i>But you wouldn't go
through proper channels.</i>

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.117
<i>You went over my head.</i>

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:05.170
<i>That hurt.</i>

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:10.509
<i>But life goes on. It's an old story,
the fight for love and glory, huh, Bob?</i>

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:15.173
<i>It helps if you think of
it as a game, Bob.</i>

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:19.844
<i>Every game has a
winner and a loser.</i>

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:31.821
<i>I'm cashing you out, Bob.</i>

01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:48.872
We need more tubing.

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:56.718
I don't think I want to
pay you that, Sal.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:02:01.643
I don't give a shit what you
want to pay. I set the prices here.

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:05.768
Listen, pal, maybe you haven't heard.
I'm the guy in Old Detroit.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:08.312
You want space in my marketplace,

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:11.190
you're gonna have
to give me a volume discount.

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:13.818
I'm not into discounts.

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:17.242
Joe, show the man
what we brought him for Christmas.

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:28.913
Think about it, chum.
Good business is where you find it.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:38.429
Okay, let me try to put
this in perspective.

01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:41.804
You killed a bunch of cops.

01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:46.764
The word around is that you've got
a lot of heavy connections downtown.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:50.354
You make a lot of
my friends nervous.

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:57.778
A lot of people
would love to see a guy like me

01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:00.656
put a guy like you out of business.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:03.947
I don't know. I don't know.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:07.083
Maybe I'm just not
making myself clear.

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:12.464
I don't want to fuck with you, Sal.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:18.053
But I got the connections.
I got the sales organization.

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:21.677
I got the muscle
to shove enough of this factory

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:26.808
so far up your stupid wop ass
that you'll shit snow for a year.

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:29.639
Frankie, blow this
cocksucker's head off.

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.984
Guns, guns, guns!

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:36.855
Come on, Sal!

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:39.532
The Tigers are playing tonight.

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:43.157
I never miss a game.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.460
Just kidding.

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:04.507
Go!

01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:10.351
Go.

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:31.581
<i>Come quietly or there
will be trouble.</i>

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:34.795
Fuck you!

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:14.472
<i>Clarence Boddicker,
you are under arrest.</i>

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:16.306
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

01:06:17.515 --> 01:06:18.687
Fuck you!

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:27.071
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:29.448
I'm protected, man.
I've got protection!

01:06:29.527 --> 01:06:31.074
<i>You have the right to an attorney.</i>

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:32.906
What is this shit?

01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:38.745
Goddamn it.

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:40.830
Goddamn it! Listen to me!

01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:44.509
Listen to me, you fuck!
There's another guy.

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:47.345
He's OCP.
He's a senior president.

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:50.974
<i>Anything you say
may be used against you.</i>

01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:52.892
It's Dick Jones!

01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:00.650
Don't you get it?
You cocksucker!

01:07:00.725 --> 01:07:04.355
I work for Dick Jones.
Dick Jones!

01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:09.114
He's the number two guy at OCP.
OCP runs the cops!

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:12.370
You're a cop.

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.245
Cop.

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:30.218
<i>Yes. I am a cop.</i>

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:36.769
I don't like it any more
than you do, Reed, but listen!

01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:38.312
You listen to me, you asshole!

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:42.393
You're talking about shutting down
a major metropolitan police force.

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:45.649
Without cops, this city
would tear itself apart.

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:48.652
The Union thinks you should know
there was a strike vote last night.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.358
We lost five guys last week.

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:52.443
We're getting creamed
out there, Reed.

01:08:01.869 --> 01:08:03.121
<i>Book him.</i>

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:04.915
What's the charge?

01:08:08.876 --> 01:08:10.549
<i>He's a cop killer.</i>

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:18.432
Shit!

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.394
Just give me my fucking phone call.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.277
I understand.

01:08:30.356 --> 01:08:32.404
Look, the lawyers will
have you out in 24 hours.

01:08:32.483 --> 01:08:34.359
Just don't say anything else.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.618
Jesus, you really screwed up.

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:43.639
<i>Don't you get it?
I work for Dick Jones!</i>

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:45.265
<i>Dick Jones!</i>

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.944
<i>I work for Dick Jones!</i>

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:53.319
<i>He runs OCP.
OCP runs the cops.</i>

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:59.654
Come in, Officer.

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:02.290
You know, I don't usually see
anyone without an appointment,

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:04.117
but in your case,
I'll make an exception.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.043
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.912
On what charge?

01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:10.168
<i>Aiding and abetting a known felon.</i>

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:13.714
Sounds like I'm in a lot of trouble.

01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:16.803
You better take me in.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.176
<i>I Will.</i>

01:10:31.686 --> 01:10:33.404
What's the matter, Officer?

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:38.826
I'll tell you what's the matter.

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:42.451
It's a little insurance policy
called Directive 4.

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:45.750
My little contribution
to your psychological profile.

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:50.296
Any attempt to arrest
a senior officer of OCP

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:52.214
results in shutdown.

01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:57.086
What did you think?

01:10:58.463 --> 01:11:01.182
That you were an ordinary
police officer?

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.009
You're our product.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:07.355
And we can't very well have our
products turning against us, can we?

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:13.236
Still a little fight left in you.

01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:21.490
Maybe you'd like to meet
a friend of mine.

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:30.579
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:33.210
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.535
Put Lieutenant Hedgecock on the line.
There's trouble in the tower!

01:13:58.893 --> 01:14:00.395
<i>Prepare to fire.</i>

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:04.240
- Hey, wait a second!
- He's a cop, for God's sakes!

01:14:04.315 --> 01:14:07.285
- Hedgecock! You can't do that!
- We have orders to destroy it.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.738
- Oh, shit!
- You're maniacs!

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:11.455
<i>Fire at will.</i>

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:31.137
<i>Move in.</i>

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.068
Murphy!

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:32.369
Murphy, it's me.

01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:36.870
Lewis.

01:15:47.668 --> 01:15:48.794
Move down!

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:50.471
On the next level.

01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:53.596
Lieutenant!
Level 3, level 3. He's on level 3!

01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:55.138
Over here! Over here!

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:56.764
<i>Open fire!</i>

01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:16.122
<i>It's back.</i>

01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:19.454
<i>Big is back,
because bigger is better.</i>

01:16:19.533 --> 01:16:20.785
<i>6000 SUX.</i>

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:26.670
<i>Good evening. I'm Jesse
Perkins with Casey Wong.</i>

01:16:26.749 --> 01:16:28.751
Top story, Santa Barbara.

01:16:28.959 --> 01:16:32.839
<i>10,000 acres of wooded residential
land were scorched in an instant</i>

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:36.597
<i>when a laser cannon aboard
the strategic defense peace platform</i>

01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:39.178
<i>misfired today during
routine start-up tests.</i>

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:40.228
<i>Casey.</i>

01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:41.681
<i>Yes, it was a day of mourning</i>

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:45.018
<i>for the families of 113 people
known dead at this hour,</i>

01:16:45.101 --> 01:16:47.354
<i>among them, two former
United States Presidents</i>

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:49.905
<i>who had retired in the
Santa Barbara area.</i>

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.982
<i>A day of mourning for a country.</i>

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:56.199
<i>Police union representatives and OCP
continue negotiations today</i>

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:59.703
<i>in hopes of averting a
citywide strike by police,</i>

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:02.376
<i>scheduled to begin
tomorrow at midnight.</i>

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.203
<i>Justin Ballard-Watkins has more.</i>

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:07.335
<i>They're still on duty,
but what about tomorrow?</i>

01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:10.759
<i>That's the question we put to people
in the crime-plagued Lexington area.</i>

01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:14.055
<i>They're public servants.
They got job security.</i>

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:15.882
<i>They're not supposed to strike.</i>

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:16.966
<i>It's a free society,</i>

01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:19.765
<i>except there ain't nothin' free</i>

01:17:19.844 --> 01:17:21.596
<i>'cause there's no guarantees,
you know?</i>

01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:23.522
<i>You're on your own.</i>

01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:25.190
<i>It's the law of the jungle.</i>

01:17:28.853 --> 01:17:30.696
Be very careful.

01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:32.148
Excuse me, please.

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:35.951
They must be remodeling.

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:42.370
Hiya, Barbara.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:46.496
Listen, I'm here to see Dick Jones.

01:17:46.954 --> 01:17:49.798
But when I'm done,
I've got some free time.

01:17:50.082 --> 01:17:52.961
Maybe you could fit me in.

01:17:54.962 --> 01:17:57.431
He's expecting you, Mr. Boddicker.

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:02.348
You can keep the gum.

01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:06.853
- This looks good.
- Get a measurement on that.

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:07.933
Bring a hammer, too.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:12.317
Hey, Dickie boy. How's tricks?

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:14.531
That thing is still alive.

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:16.617
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:20.037
The police officer who arrested you,
the one you spilled your guts to.

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:24.709
Hey. Take a look at my face, Dick.

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:27.669
He was trying to kill me.

01:18:27.745 --> 01:18:29.747
He's a cyborg, you idiot.

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:33.551
He recorded every word you said.

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:36.345
His memory's admissible as evidence.

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:38.298
You involved me.

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:42.392
You're gonna have to kill it.

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:47.723
Listen, chief.

01:18:49.016 --> 01:18:51.610
Your company built
the fucking thing.

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.396
Now I got to deal with it?

01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:57.362
I don't have time for this bullshit.

01:18:58.067 --> 01:18:59.489
Suit yourself, Clarence.

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:01.991
But Delta City begins construction
in two months.

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:04.244
That's 2 million workers
living in trailers.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:08.620
That means drugs,
gambling, prostitution.

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:13.628
Virgin territory for the man who
knows how to open up new markets.

01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:16.544
One man could control it all,

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:18.550
Clarence.

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:22.471
I guess we're gonna
be friends after all,

01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:24.719
Richard.

01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:33.273
Destroy it.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:37.524
Gonna need some major firepower.

01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:42.285
You got access to military weaponry?

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:46.290
We practically are the military.

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:26.243
<i>Did you bring the gun?</i>

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:27.619
The precinct was deserted.

01:20:27.698 --> 01:20:30.167
Half the force
didn't show up for work today.

01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:32.244
Everyone else walks out at midnight.

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:33.921
I guess we're on strike.

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:37.671
I wasn't sure what you needed.
I sort of grabbed things.

01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:41.633
Your gun.

01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:44.848
You asked for this?

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:50.600
I brought you some food.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:54.775
<i>No, thank you.
I'm not hungry.</i>

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:21.134
<i>You may not like what
you're going to see.</i>

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:58.421
It's really good to see
you again, Murphy.

01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:06.384
<i>Murphy had a wife and son.
What happened to them?</i>

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:11.056
After the funeral, she moved away.

01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:13.186
<i>Where did they go?</i>

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:18.150
She thought you were dead.
She started over again.

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:22.943
<i>I can feel them.</i>

01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:29.279
<i>But I can't remember them.</i>

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:36.619
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:26.844
<i>Happy birthday, Dave.
She's from me.</i>

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:31.219
<i>Well, can I have you both?</i>

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:35.011
<i>- Sure. We've had our shots.
- Sure. We've had our shots.</i>

01:23:36.887 --> 01:23:38.935
<i>I'd buy that for a dollar!</i>

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.275
Hey, Emil.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:48.232
How's the Gray Bar Hotel?

01:23:48.315 --> 01:23:50.659
Not bad.
They let me keep the shirt.

01:23:50.734 --> 01:23:52.111
Nobody popped my cherry.

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:54.367
Emil, how you doing, man?
Good to see you.

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:55.789
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.787
First they let me out
of jail for free,

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:00.619
then what do I find
in the prison parking lot

01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:03.125
but a brand new 6000 SUX.

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:05.128
Still got the factory sticker on it!

01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:06.800
Clarence.

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:09.094
Joey's got a car just
like yours, man.

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:12.719
Yo, Clarence,
what do you think, buddy?

01:24:18.929 --> 01:24:20.476
What do you got there, Clarence?

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:22.058
Wait up for me!

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:26.236
Whoa! A new toy! Can I play?

01:24:28.814 --> 01:24:30.282
Watch this.

01:24:30.357 --> 01:24:32.860
Wait... Wait a minute,
Clarence, Clarence!

01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:36.076
Shit!

01:24:38.532 --> 01:24:39.624
What the fuck?

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.668
- Nice car, Joe.
- Fuck you, Clarence.

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:42.790
Let me try that.

01:24:42.869 --> 01:24:46.794
Cobra Assault Cannon.
State of the art. Bang! Bang!

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:55.344
I like it!

01:24:56.216 --> 01:24:58.139
Give it up, faggot. Let a man...

01:24:58.218 --> 01:24:59.561
No, butthole! Get your own!

01:24:59.636 --> 01:25:00.888
Come on!

01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:08.816
Get the other gun, Emil!

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:11.907
No car is safe!

01:25:11.982 --> 01:25:13.154
Do it, Emil!

01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:21.992
Heads up, you guys.

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:33.883
He's in the steel mill.
Let's go.

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:36.715
All right, cut the horseshit!
We're moving out.

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:39.176
Come on, Emil!
Get your ass in the van!

01:25:39.259 --> 01:25:40.977
Come on, lard ass,
let's move it!

01:25:41.053 --> 01:25:43.147
I'll get you, faggot!

01:26:37.442 --> 01:26:38.614
What are you doing?

01:26:40.487 --> 01:26:42.740
<i>My targeting system
is a little messed up.</i>

01:26:45.784 --> 01:26:47.331
Can I help you?

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:49.713
<i>Aim for me.</i>

01:27:00.757 --> 01:27:02.384
Are you locked in now?

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:03.559
<i>Yes.</i>

01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:06.305
A little more to the left.

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:08.348
Here.

01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:18.525
I figure that's dead-on.

01:27:18.608 --> 01:27:19.951
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:40.513
- All right. Let's do it.
- Come on, man, let's smoke him!

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:45.807
The wrecking crew is here!
Where is that metallic mother?

01:27:45.886 --> 01:27:47.479
Zip it up, Emil!

01:27:47.888 --> 01:27:50.061
Nothing fancy. Just kill him.

01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:52.355
Emil, in the van.

01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:57.155
<i>You should get out of here now.</i>

01:27:57.230 --> 01:27:58.903
Hey, we're partners.

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:01.318
<i>Get the car.</i>

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.147
Damn it! Shit!

01:28:39.231 --> 01:28:40.778
<i>Looking for me?</i>

01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:55.546
Cut him off! Come on!

01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:57.169
Go on, cut him off!

01:28:57.249 --> 01:28:58.671
Go, go!

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:32.993
Okay! Now I got you!

01:30:19.915 --> 01:30:20.916
Shit!

01:30:35.597 --> 01:30:36.814
Help me.

01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:38.813
Don't touch me, man!

01:30:40.518 --> 01:30:41.940
Help me.

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:45.987
God!

01:31:00.997 --> 01:31:02.123
Shit!

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:31.362
Bye-bye, baby.

01:31:31.444 --> 01:31:32.946
<i>Clarence!</i>

01:31:58.930 --> 01:31:59.977
Okay.

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.017
I give up.

01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:04.144
<i>I'm not arresting you anymore.</i>

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:06.730
Now, wait a second.

01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:15.117
Wait a minute.

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:17.369
You're taking this kind of
personal, aren't you?

01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:20.919
Come on, man. Come on, now.
You're making me nervous.

01:32:20.994 --> 01:32:22.621
Come on, you can't do this.

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:24.706
Come on now!
Don't mess around!

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.879
Hey! Hey!

01:32:27.042 --> 01:32:28.840
Come on, man, now,
don't get cute!

01:32:33.298 --> 01:32:35.221
Die, you bastard!

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:36.301
Yeah!

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:38.182
Yeah! All right!

01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:40.021
All right!

01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:42.524
I got him, Clarence!
I got him!

01:33:09.959 --> 01:33:12.678
Sayonara, Robocop!

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:28.020
<i>Lewis!</i>

01:33:29.771 --> 01:33:30.943
<i>Lewis!</i>

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:36.573
Murphy, I'm a mess!

01:33:39.697 --> 01:33:41.290
<i>They'll fix you.</i>

01:33:42.242 --> 01:33:43.994
<i>They fix everything.</i>

01:33:54.129 --> 01:33:56.006
The police strike could
really work for us.

01:33:56.089 --> 01:33:59.389
By the end of the week, we can have
Ed 209s in place all over the city

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:01.561
and expect immediate public support.

01:34:01.636 --> 01:34:04.856
I've got one downstairs
guarding the building now.

01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:14.783
<i>You are illegally parked
on private property.</i>

01:34:14.983 --> 01:34:17.862
<i>You have 20 seconds
to move your vehicle.</i>

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:55.110
because whatever happens,

01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:58.444
this corporation will live up to the
guiding principles of its founder.

01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:01.996
Courage, strength, conviction.

01:35:04.991 --> 01:35:09.872
We will meet each new challenge
with the same aggressive attitude.

01:35:12.207 --> 01:35:13.504
What is it?

01:35:14.959 --> 01:35:16.427
I don't know.

01:35:19.339 --> 01:35:21.307
How can we help you, Officer?

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:23.893
<i>Dick Jones is wanted for murder.</i>

01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:28.774
This is absurd! That thing is a
violent mechanical psychopath.

01:35:28.848 --> 01:35:33.194
<i>My program will not allow me to act
against an officer of this company.</i>

01:35:33.686 --> 01:35:36.405
These are serious charges.
What is your evidence?

01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:50.250
<i>I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.</i>

01:35:51.246 --> 01:35:53.874
<i>Now it's time to erase that mistake.</i>

01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:58.504
<i>I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.</i>

01:35:59.337 --> 01:36:01.931
<i>Now it's time to erase
that mistake.</i>

01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:03.558
He's got a gun!

01:36:04.634 --> 01:36:05.931
Get up!

01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:07.808
I want a chopper.
Now!

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:11.224
We will walk to the roof very calmly.

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:14.398
I will board the chopper
with my hostage.

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:18.439
Anybody tries to stop me,

01:36:19.732 --> 01:36:21.609
the old geezer gets it.

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:26.614
Dick, you're fired!

01:36:28.491 --> 01:36:29.492
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:36:54.934 --> 01:36:57.528
Nice shooting, son.
What's your name?

01:37:00.315 --> 01:37:01.487
<i>Murphy.</i>

01:37:02.305 --> 01:37:08.251
