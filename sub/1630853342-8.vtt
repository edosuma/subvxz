13:54.921 --> 13:57.706
-My king.
-My liege.

14:07.934 --> 14:11.459
It is wonderful to see you,
King Ridley.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.853
What brings you to my sanctuary?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.858
I'm looking for this.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.470
Some sort of...

14:22.513 --> 14:24.733
healing stone?

14:24.776 --> 14:28.041
M'BENGA:
Its readings indicate
I'm perfectly healthy.

14:28.084 --> 14:29.564
Readings?

14:31.435 --> 14:33.437
Allow me to examine you.

14:40.314 --> 14:41.576
[gasps softly]

14:41.619 --> 14:44.231
[exhales shakily]

14:44.274 --> 14:46.494
So much pain.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.844
-[exhales]
-It weighs down your spirit.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.325
You should have
come to me sooner.

14:54.763 --> 14:58.810
And what does your device
say of me?

14:59.855 --> 15:02.858
-It seems your dopamine levels
are highly elevated.
-Dopamine?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.729
[footsteps approaching]

15:05.730 --> 15:07.123
My king.

15:07.167 --> 15:09.212
I know you said not to follow,

15:09.256 --> 15:12.172
but Princess Thalia insisted.

15:22.356 --> 15:24.140
[exhales]

15:24.184 --> 15:26.142
My dear,

15:26.186 --> 15:27.230
brave King Ridley.

15:27.274 --> 15:29.058
I'm so grateful

15:29.102 --> 15:30.103
to have finally found you.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.974
Queen Neve

15:32.018 --> 15:33.671
has invaded my kingdom.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.238
She's obsessed

15:35.282 --> 15:36.544
with the Mercury Stone.
She thinks I have it.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.372
Her Crimson Guard

15:38.415 --> 15:41.810
captured my throne
and imprisoned my subjects.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.420
I mean, I scarcely escaped
with my life,

15:43.464 --> 15:46.554
not to mention
my poor little Runa.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.425
-Isn't that right?
-That, uh...

15:48.469 --> 15:49.861
-LA'AN: Mommy loves you so much.
-That is terrible.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.733
LA'AN:
I know

15:51.776 --> 15:55.302
you have the Mercury Stone
safely in your keeping.

15:55.345 --> 15:56.607
I...

16:00.829 --> 16:02.396
[growls softly]

16:02.439 --> 16:04.441
Sure.

16:04.485 --> 16:06.139
Yes.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.402
The stone is safe.

16:08.445 --> 16:10.056
Heed me.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.667
If you do not harness
the stone's powers

16:12.710 --> 16:15.148
to capture and stop Queen Neve,

16:15.191 --> 16:17.846
she will have all of us
in chains.

16:17.889 --> 16:21.023
Your kingdom
will fall as mine has.

16:22.459 --> 16:25.810
Uh, what is this?

16:25.854 --> 16:28.813
This does not look
like the Mercury Stone.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.946
You are very perceptive.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.687
It is not.

16:32.730 --> 16:34.732
[chuckles softly]
Oh!

16:34.776 --> 16:37.387
[laughing]
Oh!

16:39.041 --> 16:41.304
You have another weapon
in your mighty arsenal.

16:41.348 --> 16:45.656
Oh! Brutal Queen Neve stands
nary a chance, Runa, does she?

16:45.700 --> 16:49.225
My Princess Runa applauds you.
[high-pitched exclaiming]

16:51.227 --> 16:55.710
What are her dopamine levels?

16:56.841 --> 16:58.974
Also higher than normal.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.671
LA'AN:
Is that bad?

17:00.715 --> 17:02.630
Is it good?

17:02.673 --> 17:04.458
It's curious.

17:04.501 --> 17:08.027
It's a sign of heightened
neurological activity.

17:09.071 --> 17:12.074
My king, the princess is right.

17:12.118 --> 17:15.512
If you're not prepared to use
the power of the stone,

17:15.556 --> 17:19.777
then allow me to lead an attack
against the Crimson Guard.

17:19.821 --> 17:22.780
-Their heads will roll.
-[La'An gasps]

17:22.824 --> 17:26.132
Perhaps we could refrain from
any unnecessary head chopping.

17:26.175 --> 17:29.222
Oh. That's disappointing.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.093
-[footsteps approaching]
-HEMMER: Lieutenant Mitchell,
take your hands

17:31.137 --> 17:34.183
off me.
I'm your superior officer.

17:34.227 --> 17:37.273
-The Crimson Guard.
-[gasps]

17:37.317 --> 17:40.102
Let me go.
I'll have you court-martialed.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.756
Silence.
Did you think your crimes

17:41.799 --> 17:43.758
would go unpunished, wizard?

17:43.801 --> 17:45.368
I'm not a wizard.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.762
-I'm the chief engineer.
-You wear a wizard's robes.

17:47.805 --> 17:49.372
HEMMER:
This is absurd. I don't know

17:49.416 --> 17:51.896
where these came from.
They just appeared.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.768
Proof of your powers, wizard.

17:53.811 --> 17:58.512
LA'AN:
Halt your dark deeds,
accursed Crimson Guard!

17:58.555 --> 18:02.124
Your hour of cruelty
is at an end,

18:02.168 --> 18:03.734
for King Ridley is here

18:03.778 --> 18:06.824
to strike fear
in your evil hearts.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.395
Um...

18:17.574 --> 18:20.403
Uh, release
Caster the Wizard at once.

18:20.447 --> 18:23.798
We don't answer to you,
false king.

18:23.841 --> 18:25.669
Unless you're here

18:25.713 --> 18:27.628
to surrender the Mercury Stone.

18:27.671 --> 18:30.718
But what about
the Letter of Accords?

18:30.761 --> 18:34.025
Are not Lady Audrey's woods
neutral territory

18:34.069 --> 18:35.636
by royal agreement?

18:36.593 --> 18:38.856
You have no rights here.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.902
The king speaks the truth.

18:40.945 --> 18:43.513
Queen Neve
no longer acknowledges

18:43.557 --> 18:45.080
the Letter of Accords.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.604
These are now her woods,

18:47.648 --> 18:48.953
and it won't be long

18:48.997 --> 18:50.651
before your kingdom
is hers, too.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.309
[Hemmer grunting]

18:58.833 --> 19:00.487
-Hemmer.
-HEMMER: Dr. M'Benga,

19:00.530 --> 19:03.664
please, help me. Everyone else
has lost their minds.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.187
[gasps]

19:06.580 --> 19:09.626
My king, perhaps it is time

19:09.670 --> 19:11.672
to unleash the stone's power.

19:11.715 --> 19:14.805
I... don't actually
have the stone.

19:14.849 --> 19:17.939
-What?
-M'BENGA: But I know who might.

19:17.982 --> 19:20.681
That wizard, Caster?

19:20.724 --> 19:22.378
He knows where it is.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.077
We must rescue him.

19:28.558 --> 19:31.039
Absolutely. Good plan.

19:31.082 --> 19:32.867
Fantastic.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.784
PIKE:
Queen Neve will be keeping
Wizard Caster here

19:36.827 --> 19:39.221
in the deepest part
of her dungeon

19:39.265 --> 19:42.224
at the center of her realm

19:42.268 --> 19:43.704
surrounded
by her most powerful forces

19:43.747 --> 19:45.532
and weapons.

19:45.575 --> 19:47.534
My good king, you mustn't go.

19:47.577 --> 19:50.798
You will surely fall victim
to her most terrible magics.

19:50.841 --> 19:53.061
PIKE:
The princess is shrewd,

19:53.104 --> 19:54.454
as always.

19:54.497 --> 19:57.326
Staging a rescue
would be unwise.

19:57.370 --> 20:00.242
Diplomacy might be more prudent.

20:00.286 --> 20:03.027
I'm sorry,
but we need the Mercury Stone.

20:03.071 --> 20:04.899
And it's hard to hear

20:04.942 --> 20:07.728
-over the sound
of your trembling boots.
-That's enough.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.035
We're going to try diplomacy.

20:12.559 --> 20:15.649
If that doesn't work, then
you can cut something in half.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.564
Thank you, sire.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.479
Starfall is thirsty.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.002
Ridiculous name for a sword.

-You're ridiculous.
-M'BENGA: You are both

20:22.308 --> 20:24.310
going to escort me
to Queen Neve.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.140
With as little bickering
as possible, please.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.622
And what of me, my Lord?

20:32.666 --> 20:34.537
-And Runa?
-[Runa whining]

20:34.581 --> 20:36.322
She should stay here.

20:37.366 --> 20:40.761
And, um, you should stay
to protect her.

20:41.805 --> 20:43.981
[chuckles]:
Oh, a wise plan,

20:44.025 --> 20:46.419

We shall await your return.

20:47.463 --> 20:49.552
And if you should fall
in battle,

21:14.795 --> 21:17.319
Okay.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.712
Let's go.

21:18.755 --> 21:21.845
I think I might
be more useful staying...

-M'BENGA: Oh, man!
-All right.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.720

This forest is full
of Crimson banners.

21:26.763 --> 21:29.940
Queen Neve grows more brazen
by the day.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.425
We are not alone.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.912
Step forward.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.348
Slowly.

21:51.048 --> 21:53.747
Please point that elsewhere.

King Ridley.

22:01.885 --> 22:03.931
I'm surprised to find you here,

22:03.974 --> 22:07.587
though I cannot say
if I think it foolish or brave.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.284
Right.

22:09.328 --> 22:12.113
Well, we're looking
for the Wizard Caster.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.116
Ah. A fool's errand, then,

22:15.159 --> 22:17.118
for he is now in the hands
of Queen Neve.

22:17.161 --> 22:18.685
ORTEGAS:
And what is to keep us

22:18.728 --> 22:21.427
from simply marching in there
and taking him?

22:22.428 --> 22:24.343
The Swamp of Infinite Deaths.

22:24.386 --> 22:27.084
-Oh, that is not a good swamp.
-SPOCK: Alas,

22:27.128 --> 22:29.652
the only way to her kingdom

22:29.696 --> 22:32.089
Oh. Oh, turn back then?

22:32.133 --> 22:35.092
-Yes? No?
-I would die infinite deaths

22:35.136 --> 22:37.443
to no longer hear your whining.

22:37.486 --> 22:40.097
Are you sure, Pollux,

22:40.141 --> 22:42.883
that there is no way
for you to help us?

22:42.926 --> 22:45.276
-Why should I help you?
-M'BENGA: Because

22:45.320 --> 22:47.757
Caster is your brother?

22:47.801 --> 22:49.672
-He is?
-I had no idea.

22:49.716 --> 22:51.282
How did you know?

22:51.326 --> 22:53.110
I read it in a book.

22:53.154 --> 22:56.636
And you would... help Caster?

22:56.679 --> 22:58.986
Not merely use him
for his power?

22:59.029 --> 23:01.467
If you lead us
through the swamp,

23:01.510 --> 23:04.252
I promise to free him.

23:05.253 --> 23:06.689
Hmm.

23:08.256 --> 23:10.345
I shall aid you, then.

23:10.389 --> 23:13.130
There is a way around the swamp.
A secret way.

in her dungeons.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.798
This tunnel
should lead us there.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.412
Are you sure we can trust him?

23:33.455 --> 23:35.588
No.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.546
I'm sure we can't trust him.

23:37.590 --> 23:39.505
But that's okay.

This is still the only way
to get to Caster.

If you say so, sire.

My king, we have been led
into a trap.

24:23.636 --> 24:25.681
I suspected as much.

24:25.725 --> 24:27.378
You knew?

24:27.422 --> 24:29.555
Loosely.

24:29.598 --> 24:31.382
In any case, I knew

24:31.426 --> 24:33.689
Queen Neve should be entering
the story right about now.

24:33.733 --> 24:36.344
And I knew I should have
stayed in the castle.

24:36.387 --> 24:39.042
It's always safer at home. Ow.

24:39.086 --> 24:42.524
Welcome, King Ridley.

24:42.568 --> 24:46.180
Now, where is the Mercury Stone?

24:48.138 --> 24:50.967
Could be anywhere, really.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.623
Fine.

24:54.667 --> 24:57.887
I'll let my torturers drag
its location out of you, then.

24:57.931 --> 24:59.236
They love their work.

24:59.280 --> 25:02.718
They're very... thorough.

well for your loyalty, sorcerer.

to close in on me!

25:38.493 --> 25:40.495
Are we the only two crew members
who are unaffected?

25:40.539 --> 25:42.366
-It would appear so.
-Do you have

25:42.410 --> 25:44.978
any idea why everyone's
acting so strangely?

25:45.021 --> 25:47.197
They're all playing characters
from a children's book

-called The Elysian Kingdom.
-A children's book?

25:50.418 --> 25:53.639
-How do you know this?
-Because I read it
to my daughter.

25:53.682 --> 25:55.902
It's a long story.

25:55.945 --> 25:59.601
The important question to ask
is why you and I aren't affected

25:59.645 --> 26:01.429
and why they are.

26:01.472 --> 26:04.388
I thought
the important question is

26:04.432 --> 26:06.608
where is the Mercury Stone?

26:06.652 --> 26:09.437
-Stone?
-M'BENGA: It's a weapon.

26:09.480 --> 26:12.092
But it's fictional.
From the book.

26:12.135 --> 26:15.138
-Where is this weapon?
-Well, in the book, Caster

26:15.182 --> 26:17.358
helps King Ridley to find it.

26:17.401 --> 26:21.231
-I have no idea how to find it.
-I know. I came to rescue you

26:21.275 --> 26:23.277
because you're the only
other person unaffected,

26:23.320 --> 26:26.236
which means you can help
solve the real problem.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.674
How do we undo all of this?

26:28.717 --> 26:30.501
Where were you when it started?

26:30.545 --> 26:32.547
In Engineering.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.114
I had just checked
the warp engines,

26:34.157 --> 26:35.811
and I suddenly felt...

26:35.855 --> 26:37.465
I don't know,

26:37.508 --> 26:40.163
a consciousness
press against my own.

26:40.207 --> 26:42.035
Luckily, my years
of telepathic training

26:42.078 --> 26:43.471
allowed me to block it.

26:43.514 --> 26:45.212
Consciousness?

26:45.255 --> 26:46.822
Coming from where?

26:46.866 --> 26:48.476
I didn't have time
to figure it out.

26:48.519 --> 26:50.434
I assume I'm able
to keep my memories

26:50.478 --> 26:52.654
because
of my telepathic abilities.

26:52.698 --> 26:55.396
Have you considered, Doctor,
the entity I sensed

26:55.439 --> 26:57.354
might have pulled the story
from your mind?

26:57.398 --> 26:59.356
But why?

26:59.400 --> 27:01.837
Impossible to know
without asking.

27:01.881 --> 27:03.273
Hemmer,

27:03.317 --> 27:05.362
do you think
you can make contact

27:05.406 --> 27:06.929
with this entity again?

27:06.973 --> 27:08.931
Contact with it is unpleasant.

27:08.975 --> 27:10.890
That's why I blocked it.

27:10.933 --> 27:13.936
It felt as if my brain were
being squeezed through my nose.

27:13.980 --> 27:16.417
I did that to a man once.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.114
HEMMER:
I was, however,

27:18.158 --> 27:21.117
able to sense that the entity's
not on another ship

27:21.161 --> 27:24.164
but rather a part
of the nebula itself.

27:24.207 --> 27:26.340
Do you think if we access
the ship's scanner array,

27:26.383 --> 27:27.733
we can learn more
about this entity?

27:27.776 --> 27:29.604
It's quite possible.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.214
Engineering is close by.

27:31.258 --> 27:33.390
I can control
the ship's systems from there.

27:33.434 --> 27:35.392
We have to find a way out
of here first.

27:35.436 --> 27:36.785
And fast.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.178
Maybe I can get us out of here

27:38.221 --> 27:40.397
with the help
of some powerful magic

27:40.441 --> 27:41.877
called science.

27:49.493 --> 27:51.713
What would a human magician say?

27:51.757 --> 27:53.497
Abracadabra.

27:53.541 --> 27:56.283
Abracadabra. I like it.

27:56.326 --> 27:58.328
Don't look. It'll blind you.

27:58.372 --> 27:59.721
What about you?

27:59.765 --> 28:01.767
I am a wizard.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.080
[metal clangs]

28:13.648 --> 28:15.519
Oh, thank goodness.

28:15.563 --> 28:16.738
Oh!

28:23.745 --> 28:26.443
Not bad, wizard.

28:26.487 --> 28:28.228
I like this...

28:28.271 --> 28:30.883
science.

28:38.891 --> 28:40.936
What do you mean

28:40.980 --> 28:42.982
that the prisoners have escaped?

28:43.025 --> 28:46.594
The wizard conjured
his way out of the cell.

28:46.637 --> 28:50.250
And yet you stand here cowering

28:50.293 --> 28:52.948
-instead of going after them.
-MITCHELL: I was

28:52.992 --> 28:54.994
-about to.
-UHURA: You were about to?

28:56.430 --> 29:00.086
You were
about to lose your head.

29:02.479 --> 29:05.831
Be grateful your queen
is feeling merciful today.

29:05.874 --> 29:08.877
I will give you another chance
to earn my favor.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.144
Pollux,

29:15.188 --> 29:17.799
would you be so kind
as to take my Crimson Guard

29:17.843 --> 29:19.627
and bring back my prisoners

29:19.670 --> 29:21.803
before I toss you in the dungeon
in their place?

29:21.847 --> 29:24.327
As you wish, my liege.

29:29.506 --> 29:31.944
[door whooshes open]

29:31.987 --> 29:33.641
[door whooshes shut]

29:35.643 --> 29:38.211
Once inside,
I can block the door.

29:38.254 --> 29:41.127
That should give us time to
access the ship's scanner array.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.868
And what ship, pray tell,

29:42.911 --> 29:44.565
are you speaking of?

29:44.608 --> 29:46.480
Spock.

29:46.523 --> 29:48.787
M'BENGA:
Pollux.

29:51.224 --> 29:52.703
Get out of our way.

29:52.747 --> 29:54.053
Or what?

29:54.096 --> 29:55.794
You're unarmed.

29:59.101 --> 30:00.624
[grunting]

30:03.279 --> 30:05.238
I have armed myself.

30:07.936 --> 30:09.459
[grunting]

30:10.852 --> 30:12.811
It would seem Adya has
this fight well under control.

30:12.854 --> 30:15.509
Perhaps I would serve you best
from the safety of the castle.

30:16.553 --> 30:18.904
-M'BENGA: Sure.
-Thank you, sire!

30:19.905 --> 30:21.384
Really?

30:21.428 --> 30:24.431
Sir Rauth isn't exactly known
for his bravery.

30:24.474 --> 30:25.998
[grunting]

30:56.289 --> 30:57.899
[grunting]

31:09.171 --> 31:10.912
This isn't over.

31:10.956 --> 31:12.392
UNA:
Yes, it is.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.222
What's happening? Who is this?

31:16.265 --> 31:18.877
Z'ymira the Huntress.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.837
She's an ally.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.362
Z'ymira.

31:26.406 --> 31:28.321
Adya.

31:31.324 --> 31:33.108
You said you would call on me.

31:33.152 --> 31:35.023
-Been a busy time.
-ORTEGAS: A raven

31:35.067 --> 31:36.372
would be too much trouble?

31:36.416 --> 31:37.808
Can we not do this now?

31:37.852 --> 31:39.375
I saved your life.
That's something, right?

31:39.419 --> 31:43.162
As grateful as I am
for whatever this is,

31:43.205 --> 31:45.077
but we really should be
hurrying on to Engineering.

31:45.120 --> 31:48.384
Yes. We should put an end
to this fantasy

31:48.428 --> 31:51.039
before someone
seriously gets hurt.

31:51.997 --> 31:54.738
This is most unusual.

31:54.782 --> 31:58.351
When I scan the nebula, I find
evidence of a single life form,

31:58.394 --> 32:00.570
including brain activity,
and yet

32:00.614 --> 32:03.008
there is no sign
of a physical body.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.794
A consciousness without a body.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.883
Floating in space.

32:09.884 --> 32:13.496
With the power to create
a new reality?

32:13.540 --> 32:15.629
Sounds almost like
you're describing a god.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.154
Doctor, are you familiar

32:19.198 --> 32:21.461
with the theory
of the Boltzmann brain?

32:21.504 --> 32:24.333
I recall learning something
about it in university.

32:24.377 --> 32:26.031
A Boltzmann brain

32:26.074 --> 32:28.990
is a theoretical, spontaneously
generated consciousness.

32:30.470 --> 32:33.212
It may be we have
just encountered one.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.825
So one day...

32:37.868 --> 32:39.870
out of nothing,

32:39.914 --> 32:42.264
an all-powerful being just...

32:42.308 --> 32:44.353
appears?

32:46.399 --> 32:48.444
And this consciousness
has somehow trapped

32:48.488 --> 32:50.359
our ship in the nebula?

32:50.403 --> 32:51.882
And turned the crew

32:51.926 --> 32:53.493
into the characters
from a book I've read?

32:53.536 --> 32:55.843
At least it made you the hero.

32:58.237 --> 32:59.934
Let's say you're right.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.328
How do we get it to stop?

33:02.371 --> 33:04.199
Because until we do,

33:04.243 --> 33:05.809
we are stuck here.

33:05.853 --> 33:07.898
Perhaps you are the problem.

33:07.942 --> 33:10.727
It's recreating
a story you read.

33:10.771 --> 33:13.513
It is possible the entity
is reading your brainwaves.

33:13.556 --> 33:17.125
If we can find a way
to sever that connection,

33:17.169 --> 33:18.953
like by hurting you,

33:18.997 --> 33:21.042
the entity might let
the Enterprisego.

33:21.086 --> 33:23.697
You dare to threaten my king?

33:23.740 --> 33:25.394
Stand down, Adya.

33:25.438 --> 33:27.483
I can shoot him with an arrow
if that helps.

33:29.442 --> 33:31.052
I don't really understand
what's going on.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.923
I thought the point
was to hurt the king.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.447
What's wrong with you?

33:34.490 --> 33:36.840
I have sworn an oath
to protect him.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.842
You'll just never
understand that, will you?

33:38.886 --> 33:40.931
I am Huntress of the Forest.

33:40.975 --> 33:42.803
I swore my allegiance
to no one but her.

33:42.846 --> 33:44.196
You know that.

33:44.239 --> 33:46.676
Sometimes I wonder
if we have anything

33:46.720 --> 33:48.678
-in common.
-HEMMER: Perhaps it is

33:48.722 --> 33:50.724
your differences
which drew you together.

33:52.204 --> 33:54.771
M'BENGA:
Hold on a second.

33:54.815 --> 33:56.251
Something's wrong here.

33:56.295 --> 33:57.687
Your Majesty?

33:57.731 --> 34:00.081
This is not how the story goes.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.040
The two of you--

34:02.083 --> 34:04.912
Adya, Z'ymira--
you don't even know each other.

34:04.955 --> 34:06.957
Not to contradict you,

34:07.001 --> 34:08.959
but we know each other quite,

34:09.003 --> 34:11.092
quite well.

34:11.136 --> 34:12.920
Quite well.

34:12.963 --> 34:15.009
But you're not supposed to.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.578
The two of you
never actually meet

34:18.621 --> 34:20.667
in the book.

34:22.016 --> 34:24.497
Except... Rukiya.

34:26.499 --> 34:29.110
Rukiya? Is she a character?

34:29.154 --> 34:31.069
She's my daughter.

34:32.331 --> 34:34.637
She has always hated

34:34.681 --> 34:36.944
how the story ended.

34:36.987 --> 34:39.729
She wanted Sir Adya
and Z'ymira to team up.

34:39.773 --> 34:42.167
I told her
when she grew up she could

34:42.210 --> 34:44.995
become a writer and give herself
the ending she wanted.

34:45.039 --> 34:47.041
Are you suggesting...

34:47.085 --> 34:49.130
the entity did not take
the story from you,

34:49.174 --> 34:51.219
but rather from your daughter?

34:54.962 --> 34:56.746
Where is Rukiya?

35:16.723 --> 35:18.638
She's gone.

35:36.699 --> 35:39.963
She was beamed out of the buffer
at 08:45 hours this morning.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.838
To... somewhere on the ship.

35:45.882 --> 35:48.233
But it won't give me
her exact location.

35:48.276 --> 35:50.496
That's very odd.

35:50.539 --> 35:52.628
Hemmer...

35:52.672 --> 35:54.674
my daughter is very sick.

35:54.717 --> 35:57.720
The longer she stays
out of the buffer,

35:57.764 --> 36:00.245
the faster her illness
will progress.

36:01.942 --> 36:04.249
-She's dying.
-I'm so sorry, Doctor.

36:05.380 --> 36:07.121
Let me help.

36:08.775 --> 36:10.733
We have to find her.

36:10.777 --> 36:12.387
I'm starting
to think she might be

36:12.431 --> 36:14.955
the only one who can put
an end to all this.

36:24.747 --> 36:27.576
The Mercury Stone is a girl?

36:35.236 --> 36:37.760
If this is true...

36:37.804 --> 36:39.545
I shall take her from him.

36:39.588 --> 36:42.069
And make her my own.

36:42.112 --> 36:44.289
How will you do that, my liege?

36:47.509 --> 36:49.119
No. No, no, no, no.

36:49.163 --> 36:51.513
Unhand me, you brute. Ow.

36:51.557 --> 36:54.299
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm too young to die.

36:54.342 --> 36:55.517
Oh!

36:55.561 --> 36:57.171
[whimpering]

36:57.215 --> 36:58.607
Please.

36:58.651 --> 37:01.480
I beg you... spare me.

37:04.091 --> 37:07.529
Whether you live or die
depends entirely on you,

37:07.573 --> 37:09.052
Sir Rauth.

37:09.096 --> 37:10.880
What do you want from me?

37:12.186 --> 37:14.580
Your loyalty.

37:17.322 --> 37:19.889
Oh.

37:26.418 --> 37:29.203
[chuckling]

37:39.692 --> 37:40.736
[beeps]

37:40.780 --> 37:43.565
The forest calls.

37:50.398 --> 37:52.618
Damn it!

37:53.749 --> 37:55.795
Doctor?

37:56.839 --> 37:58.841
I take it you've had
no luck finding her.

37:59.842 --> 38:01.017
No.

38:01.061 --> 38:03.411
I have not.

38:03.455 --> 38:05.500
Someone...

38:07.676 --> 38:09.809
...something...

38:09.852 --> 38:12.290
took her out of the buffer
and hid her.

38:12.333 --> 38:14.379
Perhaps we are thinking of this

38:14.422 --> 38:16.163
the wrong way.

38:16.206 --> 38:18.252
Where would your daughter
want to go?

38:22.169 --> 38:25.041
My quarters are down here.

38:25.085 --> 38:27.217
Rukiya always said
she wanted to see them.

38:27.261 --> 38:30.525
Your Majesty, I am so glad
to see you alive and safe.

38:30.569 --> 38:33.572
No thanks to your cowardice.

38:33.615 --> 38:35.487
I lament.

38:35.530 --> 38:37.358
I am not a fighter.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.273
But what purpose would
my death have served,

38:39.317 --> 38:41.275
if it merely led
to King Ridley's downfall?

38:41.319 --> 38:43.321
You would worm your way
out of anything, wouldn't you?

38:43.364 --> 38:46.541
Please... now is not
the time to fight.

38:46.585 --> 38:48.674
We need to get into my quarters
right away.

38:51.938 --> 38:53.374
Open.

38:53.418 --> 38:56.290
[doors whoosh open]

39:02.644 --> 39:05.343
I am sorry, my liege.

39:13.046 --> 39:15.178
Did you really think

39:15.222 --> 39:17.006
I was going to let you destroy

39:17.050 --> 39:20.183
everything I've worked for,
King Ridley?

39:27.843 --> 39:30.368
ORTEGAS:
I should have known
you would betray us, Rauth.

39:32.239 --> 39:34.328
Truthfully, I should have
known it as well...

39:35.590 --> 39:37.984
...since that's what
he does in the book.

39:38.027 --> 39:39.986
Don't beat yourself up about it.

39:40.029 --> 39:41.857
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

39:41.901 --> 39:43.903
But she promised me
your kingdom and...

39:43.946 --> 39:45.513
who could turn that down?

39:45.557 --> 39:47.472
-[stomps]
-All right.

39:47.515 --> 39:49.474
As you were not willing to bend

39:49.517 --> 39:52.346
to my will,
I found someone who would.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.652
Give up, dear brother.

39:53.695 --> 39:55.567
Your powers are
no match for mine.

39:55.610 --> 39:57.569
There is no reason
you have to die.

39:57.612 --> 40:00.136
Pollux is right.

40:00.180 --> 40:01.921
All I want

40:01.964 --> 40:03.923
is King Ridley's secret weapon.

40:03.966 --> 40:06.621
This so-called...

40:06.665 --> 40:08.362
Mercury Stone.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.842
[chuckles]

40:09.885 --> 40:11.757
The girl in his quarters.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.847
Let us have her, and I'll
let you and Caster live.

40:17.850 --> 40:20.983
You shall not touch my daughter.

40:21.027 --> 40:22.811
Or I will bring the might
of my kingdom

40:22.855 --> 40:25.205
down upon your heads.

40:25.248 --> 40:27.903
HEMMER:
He's right, Queen Neve.

40:31.733 --> 40:33.648
Turn away now,

40:33.692 --> 40:36.521
or I'll unleash the full power

40:36.564 --> 40:39.524
of my powerful wizard...

40:40.916 --> 40:42.222
...powers.

40:46.226 --> 40:48.924
I'll... I'll... I'll...

40:48.968 --> 40:50.839
send you to the Event Horizon.

40:50.883 --> 40:52.580
A dark realm

40:52.624 --> 40:54.800
full of chaos and monsters

40:54.843 --> 40:57.237
and...

40:58.543 --> 41:00.719
There is no such place,
My Queen. He's bluffing.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.466
[grunting]

41:08.509 --> 41:10.250
What are you doing?

41:10.293 --> 41:12.121
[grunting]

41:12.165 --> 41:14.254
Abra...

41:14.297 --> 41:15.560
-[beeps]
-cadabra!

41:22.567 --> 41:24.873
[chuckles]

41:24.917 --> 41:26.440
Nice wizard powers.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.486
I found this in Sickbay.

41:28.529 --> 41:30.096
I set it to trigger
the transporter.

41:30.139 --> 41:31.619
They're in Cargo Bay 12.

41:31.663 --> 41:34.187
Once again, the magic

41:34.230 --> 41:36.494
of science prevails.

41:37.451 --> 41:38.757
Too much?

41:38.800 --> 41:40.106
I know.

41:40.149 --> 41:42.891
Sir Adya, guard my quarters.

41:45.851 --> 41:47.896
With my life, Sire.

41:52.205 --> 41:54.250
[door whooshes open]

41:54.294 --> 41:57.427
Daddy, you made it!

42:21.060 --> 42:24.324
There's no trace of cygnokemia.

42:24.367 --> 42:26.413
You're healthy.

42:27.632 --> 42:29.590
How?

42:29.634 --> 42:32.114
My friend made me better.

42:32.158 --> 42:34.160
Your friend?

42:34.203 --> 42:36.597
She woke me up,
and we've been playing.

42:36.641 --> 42:38.033
I could see you, Daddy.

42:38.077 --> 42:39.600
You did such a good job.

42:39.644 --> 42:41.254
Did you have fun?

42:41.297 --> 42:43.735
I did.

42:43.778 --> 42:45.737
But it's time to stop playing.

42:45.780 --> 42:48.217
Can we put everything back
the way it was?

42:48.261 --> 42:51.133
Why? My friend said we could
play as long as I want.

42:51.177 --> 42:53.875
Your friend doesn't mean to,

42:53.919 --> 42:56.574
but she's hurting my friends.

42:56.617 --> 42:59.054
They need to return
to their lives.

42:59.098 --> 43:01.840
Do I have to go back
into the buffer, Daddy?

43:03.537 --> 43:05.583
I don't know.

43:07.454 --> 43:09.499
Frankly, I don't understand
what's happening.

43:11.719 --> 43:13.286
Rukiya.

43:14.722 --> 43:16.681
Can I talk to your friend?

43:16.724 --> 43:19.553
It doesn't really work that way.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.555
Perhaps...

43:21.599 --> 43:24.689
I can be of some assistance.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.170
You said if you tried to connect

43:28.214 --> 43:30.085
to the consciousness again,
it could kill you.

43:30.129 --> 43:32.218
I know, but...

43:32.261 --> 43:34.655
maybe if Rukiya told
her friend we need to talk,

43:34.699 --> 43:38.528
the entity might be
more inclined to cooperate.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.970
They'd like to talk to you
if that's okay.

43:45.013 --> 43:47.146
If you would like,

43:47.189 --> 43:49.975
you may speak through me.

43:50.018 --> 43:52.760
Please be gentle.

43:59.637 --> 44:02.335
[distorted voice]:
You must not take the child.

44:03.902 --> 44:06.295
We don't mean you any harm.

44:06.339 --> 44:08.602
But I need you
to stop this fantasy.

44:10.125 --> 44:11.997
You're putting
my crew in danger.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.738
The needs of your crew
are inconsequential.

44:13.781 --> 44:16.784
You must protect the child.

44:16.828 --> 44:19.395
You have an attachment
to Rukiya.

44:19.439 --> 44:21.441
We are alike.

44:21.484 --> 44:23.573
She was lonely.

44:23.617 --> 44:25.663
Like me.

44:27.186 --> 44:29.536
Lonely?

44:29.579 --> 44:31.712
How did you know?

44:31.756 --> 44:33.975
When I probed your ship,

44:34.019 --> 44:36.586
I felt her imprisoned
in your machine.

44:36.630 --> 44:38.458
I sensed her loneliness.

44:38.501 --> 44:40.721
It matched my own.

44:40.765 --> 44:43.028
I created this world for her.

44:43.071 --> 44:45.944
To give her
a piece of her childhood

44:45.987 --> 44:48.033
you didn't allow.

44:48.076 --> 44:50.513
I was trying to protect her.

44:50.557 --> 44:53.516
Everything I did was
to keep my daughter alive.

44:54.779 --> 44:56.955
I was looking for a cure.

44:56.998 --> 44:58.957
But I'm all better now, Daddy.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.133
And I thank you for that.

45:01.176 --> 45:03.439
But whatever you are doing

45:03.483 --> 45:05.790
to create this fantasy,

45:05.833 --> 45:08.357
the crew cannot live like this.

45:08.401 --> 45:10.055
You have to let them go.

45:10.098 --> 45:11.926
If I leave,

45:11.970 --> 45:14.233
the child will die.

45:14.276 --> 45:16.888
My being near her cures her.

45:16.931 --> 45:20.065
If I release the ship
and the child goes with you,

45:20.108 --> 45:22.458
she will grow sick again.

45:22.502 --> 45:24.678
The ship cannot stay here.

45:24.722 --> 45:27.028
Then you must make a choice.

45:27.072 --> 45:29.465
The crew or your daughter.

45:30.684 --> 45:33.426
You can't ask me to do that.

45:33.469 --> 45:35.341
I had fun out here.

45:35.384 --> 45:38.083
But I'll go back into the buffer
if you want me to, Daddy.

45:40.563 --> 45:42.565
There must be another way.

45:42.609 --> 45:44.437
There is.

45:44.480 --> 45:47.701
You could leave
and she could stay.

45:49.007 --> 45:51.357
How would she live?

45:51.400 --> 45:53.489
It is her body that is ill.

45:53.533 --> 45:56.754
But her consciousness
could join with me.

45:56.797 --> 46:00.148
She would be free of sickness.

46:00.192 --> 46:02.760
She will never know death.

46:05.066 --> 46:07.155
Daddy?

46:13.118 --> 46:15.294
Your friend.

46:15.337 --> 46:17.600
She wants you to go with her.

46:17.644 --> 46:19.820
Can you come, too, Daddy?

46:23.781 --> 46:25.695
You know how in the story

46:25.739 --> 46:27.785
King Ridley has
the Mercury Stone?

46:27.828 --> 46:30.178
He wants to keep it.

46:30.222 --> 46:32.311
It protects him.

46:32.354 --> 46:34.400
Makes him happy.

46:35.444 --> 46:37.577
Until he learns

46:37.620 --> 46:39.971
that it has a soul.

46:40.014 --> 46:42.277
And that it will die

46:42.321 --> 46:44.366
if he holds onto it.

46:51.156 --> 46:53.201
He has to let it go.

46:55.247 --> 46:57.466
Even though it means

46:57.510 --> 46:59.555
he won't be happy anymore.

47:03.908 --> 47:06.345
You're my Mercury Stone.

47:09.391 --> 47:12.873
Remember I told you you could
write your own stories someday?

47:12.917 --> 47:15.006
Maybe that someday is now.

47:17.008 --> 47:19.053
But it's up to you.

47:25.190 --> 47:27.627
I want to.

47:30.804 --> 47:33.285
Okay, brave girl.

47:33.328 --> 47:34.939
I love you, Daddy.

47:38.377 --> 47:41.162
I love you, too, baby.

47:41.206 --> 47:43.251
Always.

47:45.906 --> 47:47.908
[gasping]

47:49.083 --> 47:50.955
[Hemmer grunting]

48:03.184 --> 48:05.230
[giggles]

48:05.273 --> 48:07.928
It tickles, Daddy.

48:48.316 --> 48:50.275
Rukiya?

48:50.318 --> 48:52.407
Hello, Daddy.

48:54.018 --> 48:55.933
Thank you.

48:55.976 --> 48:58.022
For everything.

48:58.065 --> 49:01.590
You were right-- I've been
creating my own adventures.

49:01.634 --> 49:04.506
I wish I could tell you
what I've seen.

49:04.550 --> 49:06.291
Seen?

49:06.334 --> 49:08.249
You just left.

49:08.293 --> 49:11.905
Moments for you have been
years for me and Debra.

49:12.906 --> 49:14.777
Debra.

49:14.821 --> 49:16.866
You named the entity after...

49:16.910 --> 49:19.217
Mom.

49:19.260 --> 49:21.306
Oh.

49:23.917 --> 49:25.963
Oh...

49:30.663 --> 49:32.752
You look...

49:32.795 --> 49:34.884
so much like her.

49:34.928 --> 49:36.930
Do I?

49:38.801 --> 49:41.239
I'm happy.

49:41.282 --> 49:43.241
I'm safe.

49:43.284 --> 49:45.547
You did the right thing.

49:45.591 --> 49:47.680
Someday we'll see
each other again.

49:47.723 --> 49:50.030
I know we will, but...

49:50.074 --> 49:52.815
you have to live
your own life now.

49:52.859 --> 49:54.904
Create your own stories.

49:56.167 --> 49:58.038
Promise me you'll be happy.

50:00.084 --> 50:01.781
I promise.

50:12.835 --> 50:14.881
[Hemmer groaning]

50:21.583 --> 50:24.021
I have the worst headache.

50:27.285 --> 50:29.461
Doctor...

50:29.504 --> 50:31.550
am I in your quarters?

50:32.681 --> 50:34.161
You don't remember?

50:34.205 --> 50:36.250
The last thing I recall...

50:37.469 --> 50:40.167
...is becoming stuck
in the Jonisian Nebula.

50:41.690 --> 50:43.431
[groaning]

50:43.475 --> 50:45.129
M'BENGA:
Chief medical officer's

50:45.172 --> 50:48.088
personal log, supplemental.

50:48.132 --> 50:50.308
None of the crew
remember what happened.

50:50.351 --> 50:51.787
The entity's doing.

50:51.831 --> 50:53.311
My daughter's doing.

50:53.354 --> 50:54.834
I'm sure.

50:54.877 --> 50:56.792
The surveillance logs are blank.

50:56.836 --> 51:00.318
It's as if every one of them
lost five hours.

51:00.361 --> 51:01.971
Except for me.

51:02.015 --> 51:04.365
UNA:
Joseph?

51:11.894 --> 51:13.679
Rukiya?

51:13.722 --> 51:15.768
She's fine.

51:17.596 --> 51:19.641
She's alive.

51:21.600 --> 51:23.645
She's safe.

51:24.951 --> 51:27.432
But, Una,

51:27.475 --> 51:30.304
I have been through something...

51:30.348 --> 51:32.741
extraordinary.

51:32.785 --> 51:35.222
And no one on the ship
remembers.

51:39.966 --> 51:42.925
You know what happened
in the missing five hours.

51:45.319 --> 51:47.539
Sounds like a hell of a story.

51:47.582 --> 51:49.628
It is.

51:52.283 --> 51:54.459
It begins...

51:54.502 --> 51:56.591
like all good stories.

51:56.635 --> 51:59.681
Once upon a time.
