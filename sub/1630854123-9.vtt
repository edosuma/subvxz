00:05.473 --> 00:07.341
- Come on.
Come on, let's go.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.077
- What's going on?
- Just get in the car.

Come on. Stay with me, Dad!

00:55.389 --> 00:56.690
- Hey, hey, hey, man!

01:00.828 --> 01:04.398
- [groaning]

01:07.135 --> 01:09.570
- Dad.
- No, no, no. Go.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.505
Get out of here.
- No, Dad, please.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.341
- Go somewhere safe, all right?

01:13.407 --> 01:16.677
And make sure that the bag in
the truck stays with you, okay?

01:16.744 --> 01:19.880
- What bag?
- Go! Now!

01:19.947 --> 01:21.449
- It's okay, it's okay.
I'm here to help.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.117
Just stay with me.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.653
Hey. Hey!

01:28.222 --> 01:29.923
Stay with me.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.692
Just stay with me.
Can you hear me?

01:31.759 --> 01:33.227
Can you hear me? Sir?

01:33.294 --> 01:34.462
Sir?

01:34.528 --> 01:35.896
Stay with me.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.735
- Oh. Thank you.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.171
- Hey!

01:43.237 --> 01:44.405
- Hey.

01:44.472 --> 01:45.539
- I tried calling you earlier.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.774
- Yeah. Sorry about that.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.376
I was, uh, stuck in a meeting.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.478
I'm working this case in LA,

01:50.544 --> 01:52.246
and there's a lot
of moving parts.

01:52.313 --> 01:55.449
- Ah, nothing easy about that
place, but weather's good.

01:55.516 --> 01:56.884
- Okay?

01:56.950 --> 01:59.353
Since when do you hate LA?
- Since forever. Come on.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.688
It's got no flavor.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.656
People are all--
- Superficial?

02:02.723 --> 02:04.825
Yeah, they all want to be
actors or surfers.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.627
They eat sushi all day.
They hate art?

02:06.694 --> 02:08.095
- Just telling me how I feel.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.663
- [chuckles]

02:09.730 --> 02:11.064
I have a meeting uptown, but,
uh,

02:11.131 --> 02:13.334
I'd like to talk to you
about some stuff later?

02:13.401 --> 02:15.436
- Stuff?
- Yeah.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.238
Stuff.
- Wait.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.539
Can I get a hint?
- No.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.574
But it's good stuff.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.042
So I'll chase you down later.

02:22.109 --> 02:23.977
- Okay. Chase me.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.185
[device beeping]

02:31.252 --> 02:32.553
- Hey! What's up?

02:34.255 --> 02:35.789
What?

02:35.856 --> 02:37.358
Did you just give me
a head nod?

02:37.425 --> 02:39.126
- I'm sorry. I just--

02:39.193 --> 02:41.161
- You okay?

02:41.229 --> 02:42.396
- Drop the bag! Now!

02:42.463 --> 02:44.398
[people yelling]

02:44.465 --> 02:45.866
Drop the bag!

02:50.371 --> 02:51.972
- Hey!

02:52.039 --> 02:53.974
You heard him.
Drop the bag.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.609
- Come on, pal.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.645
Put the bag on the ground. Now.

02:57.711 --> 03:04.852
* *

03:07.788 --> 03:10.090
What's in it? Explosive?

03:10.157 --> 03:11.825
- No.

03:11.892 --> 03:12.860
Drugs.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.501
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.135
Okay, that's fentanyl.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.104
Okay, if that bag rips,
we're all dead.

03:24.171 --> 03:30.878
* *

03:39.487 --> 03:41.489
- Okay, so...

03:43.791 --> 03:46.226
Your name is Trevor Logan,

03:46.294 --> 03:49.463
and you found a duffel bag
full of fentanyl

03:49.530 --> 03:51.432
in your father's car.
- Right.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.966
And I thought I'd bring it
to the FBI

03:53.033 --> 03:54.968
to make sure no one got hurt.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.604
Or died.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.806
- We appreciate that, Trevor.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.609
But, uh, we need to go back
a little further.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.210
How did your father
get all this fentanyl?

04:03.277 --> 04:06.780
And why did he end up leaving
it so that you discovered it?

04:06.847 --> 04:08.849
- Because he got shot.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.085
- When?

04:12.152 --> 04:14.522
- This morning.
About an hour ago.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.790
- Okay.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.792
Let's start at the beginning.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.762
Tell us about the shooting,
start to finish.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.597
- My father woke me up
real early.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.434
He said we needed
to get out of town.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.736
He grabbed the duffel bag
and ran outside.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.004
I followed him.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.640
I didn't even have
time to change.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.208
- Okay, that's good.
And then what happened?

04:35.275 --> 04:37.010
- We started to drive off.

04:37.077 --> 04:42.215
And these men pulled up in
a black car, started shooting.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.652
They hit my father a few times,
but he managed to drive away.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.053
- Where is he now?

04:46.119 --> 04:47.821
- At the hospital.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.657
There's one about
five blocks from our house.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.859
[apprehensive music]

04:51.925 --> 04:55.463
He told me to drive away
and get the hell out of there.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.697
So I did.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.600
- This is a pretty crazy story.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.335
- Well, it means
it's probably true.

05:01.402 --> 05:05.072
- I still don't understand why
he brought the drugs to us.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.642
- And why did you come down
to 26 Fed today, Trevor?

05:09.843 --> 05:11.879
- I don't want to die.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.981
And I don't want
my father to die.

05:15.483 --> 05:20.087
So I thought if I came to you
and gave you the drugs,

05:20.153 --> 05:22.289
you'd help us.

05:22.356 --> 05:28.962
* *

05:30.864 --> 05:33.266
- I need a gurney! Stat!

05:33.333 --> 05:34.668
- Looks like
he's telling the truth.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.236
- Yeah.
What about the actual shooting?

05:36.303 --> 05:37.905
Finding anything?
- Well, we've been looking,

05:37.971 --> 05:39.907
but so far, nothing.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.142
- Okay, so this kid
walks into 26 Fed

05:42.209 --> 05:44.645
with five kilos
of uncut fentanyl.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.346
- Sounds was like a riddle.
- It is.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.949
But what is the answer,
and what do we do with him?

05:49.016 --> 05:50.418
- I mean, we could charge him
with possession

05:50.484 --> 05:51.885
but that feels callous.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.320
- Yeah, he seems
like a decent kid.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.689
- Can we pull up
the father's résumé, please?

05:58.392 --> 06:01.328
- Multiple priors,
drug distribution,

06:01.395 --> 06:03.063
larceny, armed robbery.

06:03.130 --> 06:07.000
- So Trevor's father is
in the game in some capacity.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.603
He gets shot by God knows who
for God knows what.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.238
Rival dealer.
Rival gang.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.406
Pissed-off customer.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.107
- And his son tries
to make it right.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.743
- So let's give him
a chance to do that.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.110
Maybe we can turn
this serendipity

06:17.177 --> 06:18.879
into something
positive and take down

06:18.946 --> 06:20.748
a major fentanyl supplier.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.420
- So if you help us take down
this fentanyl supplier,

06:26.487 --> 06:30.157
we'll do everything that we can
to help you and your father.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.960
We're gonna need you to wear
a wire, talk to your dad,

06:33.026 --> 06:34.361
find out where
these drugs came from.

06:34.428 --> 06:37.030
- Wait, you want me
to set up my own father?

06:39.199 --> 06:40.634
No. No way.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.069
No, I can't do that.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.505
- We're not asking you
to set him up, Trevor, okay?

06:44.572 --> 06:46.440
We're asking you to get
information from him.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.176
It's information that he would
never give us on his own

06:49.242 --> 06:52.212
so you can help him
get out of this mess.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.884
You two can start over.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.420
- Start over where?

07:00.488 --> 07:01.922
- Wherever you want.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.793
- I want to go someplace warm.

07:05.859 --> 07:06.760
Like Arizona.

07:06.827 --> 07:07.828
- Okay.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.397
We can help you with that.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.866
But first, you gotta do
what we asked.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.771
- Okay.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.272
Sure.

07:19.339 --> 07:20.273
I'll do it.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.647
- Wise decision.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.749
- You mean the only decision.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.686
My father needs help.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.555
So I'll do whatever it takes.

07:34.622 --> 07:39.760
* *

07:39.827 --> 07:42.062
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.931
- Is now a good time?

07:43.997 --> 07:47.067
- Yeah. Sure.

07:47.134 --> 07:50.237
I'm guessing you figured out
what you want to do.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.238
- Yeah.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.242
I'm gonna have the baby.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.376
[both chuckle]

07:56.443 --> 07:58.612
- Oh, my God.

07:58.679 --> 07:59.713
Wow.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.014
That's amazing.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.382
- Yeah, I feel really good
about it.

08:02.449 --> 08:03.684
- Yeah, me too.

08:03.751 --> 08:07.420
This is--this is great news.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.590
- Yeah.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.959
Look, the thing is, um--

08:15.663 --> 08:16.964
I want to do it by myself.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.132
- What do you mean?

08:19.199 --> 08:24.337
- I just think that it's best
if I raise the baby on my own.

08:24.404 --> 08:28.275
* *

08:28.341 --> 08:32.312
You can be involved, of course,
if that's what you want.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.682
- Of course I want
to be involved, but why--

08:34.748 --> 08:37.084
- I just need--

08:37.150 --> 08:39.620
I just--I need to be able
to have control

08:39.687 --> 08:41.521
of my life and the baby's.

08:41.589 --> 08:42.956
- No, I get that, but--

08:43.023 --> 08:47.060
- Well, there's--
there's this possible opening

08:47.127 --> 08:49.329
in the Intelligence Unit
in Los Angeles.

08:49.396 --> 08:53.567
So I was maybe
gonna move there.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.672
I spoke to a lawyer,
and he said that he could

08:58.739 --> 09:01.141
draw up some paperwork for us.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.410
That way, we could
make it official.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.682
- You want me to sign away
my parental rights?

09:08.749 --> 09:10.784
- No.

09:10.851 --> 09:14.254
No, uh, not at all.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.625
This would just be,
like, a contract that

09:17.691 --> 09:18.959
lays out our understanding.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.762
- Our understanding.

09:21.829 --> 09:25.232
- This is really hard.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.566
Okay?

09:26.634 --> 09:30.570
And from the beginning,
you said whatever I want

09:30.638 --> 09:33.173
and whatever's best
for the baby, so...

09:35.643 --> 09:39.112
Look, just let me send you
the paperwork and you read it.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.248
And then we can talk about it.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.651
- Mm-hmm.

09:43.717 --> 09:44.652
- Okay.

09:44.718 --> 09:51.859
* *

10:00.100 --> 10:01.601
- And like I said,
just be natural.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.136
Don't force the conversation.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.272
You know, try to keep an eye
out for your father's phone.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.875
Guessing there's a lot
of useful information on there.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.025
- Hey.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.426
What are you doing here?

10:26.493 --> 10:27.728
- It's okay.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.396
No one knows I'm here.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.934
How are you feeling?

10:34.001 --> 10:35.135
- I'm okay.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.670
You know, I got lucky.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.071
There's no major damage.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.573
And they just gotta
run some tests,

10:40.640 --> 10:43.143
make sure there's
no infections.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.712
- That's good news.

10:46.714 --> 10:50.483
We just gotta make sure
those guys don't come back.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.085
- What guys?

10:52.152 --> 10:54.354
- The guys that shot you.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.690
I don't want them near you.

10:56.757 --> 10:57.825
What are their names?

10:57.891 --> 11:00.227
- Okay, this kid is not shy.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.862
[suspenseful music]

11:01.929 --> 11:03.630
- Don't worry
about any of that.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.632
- Don't worry?

11:05.699 --> 11:06.934
What if they're still
looking for you?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.368
- No, no.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.370
They probably think I'm dead.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.639
Or close to it.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.975
- What if they come here,
to the hospital?

11:15.042 --> 11:17.510
- They won't.
There's too many cameras.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.414
Hey, you got the bag, right?

11:21.481 --> 11:23.383
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.885
- Just like you said.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.686
Should I deliver
the bag to someone?

11:26.754 --> 11:27.988
Or return it
to the owner maybe?

11:28.055 --> 11:29.957
- Just keep it safe.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.624
Okay?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.861
That's all you gotta do.
Just keep it safe.

11:33.927 --> 11:37.630
When I get out of here, I'll
take care of everything else.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.399
- Trevor, see if you can
locate his phone.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.901
- So...

11:45.238 --> 11:46.539
- What are you doing?

11:46.606 --> 11:48.041
- Nothing.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.878
Just, um, I've never
been in a hospital room.

11:54.815 --> 11:58.151
- [chuckles]
Well, it ain't much to see.

11:58.218 --> 12:05.158
* *

12:06.794 --> 12:08.261
- So you're dealing
drugs these days?

12:08.328 --> 12:09.997
- Listen.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.132
We ain't talking
about this, okay?

12:12.199 --> 12:14.034
Not here.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.168
Not now.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.072
[sighs]

12:19.139 --> 12:20.941
- Enough, man.
No more questions.

12:25.112 --> 12:29.516
- When you're feeling better,
I think we should move.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.719
Go somewhere with warm weather
where people aren't shooting

12:32.786 --> 12:33.887
at each other all the time.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.825
I'm serious.

12:37.891 --> 12:43.496
We need to start a new life,
a better life.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.532
- I agree.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.500
- Excuse me.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.069
I need to run some tests.

12:49.136 --> 12:55.843
* *

13:11.859 --> 13:13.160
- The kid did a good job.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.600
Everything okay?

13:20.667 --> 13:21.768
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

13:21.835 --> 13:25.105
Just dealing with
some personal stuff.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.206
- Nina?

13:26.273 --> 13:27.574
- Yep.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.945
She, uh--she wants
to have the baby.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.513
- What?

13:33.580 --> 13:34.547
That's amazing.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.316
- Yeah, but it's complicated.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.418
Hey, good work in there.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.586
- I did okay?

13:39.652 --> 13:40.620
- Oh, yeah.

13:40.687 --> 13:41.889
You did great.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.390
You asked a lot
of good questions,

13:43.456 --> 13:45.092
and when it got suspicious,
you kept it nice and cool.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.626
- I tried to get
what you wanted,

13:46.693 --> 13:50.097
but my father,
he's really paranoid.

13:50.163 --> 13:54.267
But he's a good man, despite
some of the things he does.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.702
- That's good to know.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.437
We still got work to do.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.805
- So what about the phone?

13:58.872 --> 14:00.640
- It wasn't there.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.275
We left in such a hurry
this morning,

14:02.342 --> 14:04.144
he probably forgot to bring it
with him.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.717
- You happen to know your
father's password in case

14:10.783 --> 14:12.019
we actually find the phone?

14:12.085 --> 14:13.386
- Yeah.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.754
Trevor22.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.258
It's not like that.

14:18.325 --> 14:19.659
I set it up for him.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.861
He's not so good
with technology.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.167
It's 311,
last door on the left.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.872
- Hold on.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.874
Hey. Hey!
- Stay right there.

14:34.942 --> 14:37.844
[tense music]

14:37.911 --> 14:45.052
* *

15:29.862 --> 15:31.131
- He's gone.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.832
- All right.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.801
I'll call it in
to set up a containment.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.303
- Let's go back.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.244
- Is that you and your mom?

15:44.311 --> 15:45.845
- Yeah.

15:45.912 --> 15:49.049
[soft apprehensive music]

15:49.116 --> 15:50.917
She died when I was three.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.354
- I'm sorry to hear that.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.393
- These people are never
gonna leave us alone.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.961
Ever.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.664
- And that's why we're
gonna take them down, okay?

16:04.731 --> 16:08.701
Do you have any idea where
your dad might keep his phone?

16:08.768 --> 16:15.508
* *

16:15.575 --> 16:17.610
Tiff. Got it.

16:17.677 --> 16:18.878
- Anything good?

16:20.313 --> 16:21.881
- Uh, yeah.

16:21.948 --> 16:24.051
Yeah, no, this is real good.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.452
"Yo Vince. Where you at?

16:25.518 --> 16:27.354
Suspect said they never
received the product."

16:27.420 --> 16:29.722
And then there's
another one that afternoon.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.758
"You ignoring me."

16:31.824 --> 16:33.560
Last one that night--

16:33.626 --> 16:35.928
"Answer me, or you a dead man."

16:35.995 --> 16:37.397
This is all starting
to make sense.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.698
- Yeah.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.267
Vince was running drugs,
and he decided

16:40.333 --> 16:41.668
to keep the product
rather than delivering it,

16:41.734 --> 16:43.903
so his boss tried to kill him.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.405
- Tale as old as time.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.906
- Yeah.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.609
- We should get that phone
to the JOC.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.112
- Anything else of interest
on that burner phone?

16:52.179 --> 16:54.414
- Lots of texts about
product and deliveries,

16:54.481 --> 16:57.217
but no leads on who the
actual supplier might be.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.486
- Did you run the other number?
- Uh, also a burner.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.621
I tried to ping it, but that
phone's been deactivated.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.857
- Elise, where are we
on video near the apartment?

17:04.924 --> 17:06.959
- Just found this
right near Trevor's place.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.461
- Okay. Yeah.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.930
- Matches the description
Scola sent over.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.165
- Did you run it
through facial rec?

17:12.232 --> 17:13.433
- No hits.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.602
- [sighs] All right.
Well, keep working.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.270
[suspenseful music]

17:17.337 --> 17:19.072
So--so what?

17:19.139 --> 17:21.308
We're basically nowhere.

17:21.374 --> 17:28.281
* *

17:30.183 --> 17:32.752
- Someone broke
into the apartment?

17:32.819 --> 17:33.753
How do you know?

17:33.820 --> 17:35.255
- Because I went back.

17:35.322 --> 17:36.556
I needed a change of clothes.

17:36.623 --> 17:37.724
- I told you to stay away.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.326
- Just tell me what's going on.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.860
Who are these people?
- Hey, hey, hey. No.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.162
We're not talking about this.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.865
- Come on, Trevor.
Stay with it.

17:45.932 --> 17:49.001
- These people
are scaring me, Dad.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.237
They shot you.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.472
They broke into our apartment.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.941
They're not gonna stop until
they get what they want.

17:55.007 --> 17:57.577
- Well, Nico can
chase all he wants,

17:57.644 --> 18:00.347
but he ain't gonna find me.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.414
Or my dope.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.583
- Nico.
Okay, we got a name.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.852
Try and get a last name.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.155
- The dude's name is Nico?

18:08.221 --> 18:10.056
That's who you're working with?
- Yeah.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.958
Yeah, he screwed me
out of a few deals,

18:12.024 --> 18:14.794
so I'm just taking what's mine,
that's all.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.529
- What's his last name?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.097
- It doesn't matter.

18:18.165 --> 18:21.334
- I'm just trying to--
- I said it doesn't matter.

18:22.635 --> 18:23.570
- Okay, back off.

18:23.636 --> 18:24.771
No more questions.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.474
We got enough.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.641
- Okay.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.109
- I'm sorry.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.512
It's just all this violence
is making me nervous.

18:32.579 --> 18:33.580
- I know.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.784
Don't worry, T, all right?

18:37.850 --> 18:39.252
We're gonna be fine.

18:39.319 --> 18:43.823
You just keep your eyes
on that duffel bag, okay?

18:43.890 --> 18:46.092
That's our golden ticket, kid.

18:46.159 --> 18:52.199
* *

18:52.265 --> 18:54.033
- All we know is,
the supplier's name is Nico.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.535
I'm guessing that's
his first name,

18:55.602 --> 18:57.069
so we need to run that
through every database

18:57.136 --> 18:58.671
we have access to.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.840
We are looking for a connection
between him and Vince Logan.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.309
Same neighborhood,
same high school--

19:02.375 --> 19:04.010
- Same cell block.
- What do you got?

19:04.076 --> 19:06.379
- Found someone
named Nico Chao.

19:06.446 --> 19:09.649
Spent some time in Rikers with
Vince Logan, same cell block.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.150
It could be a long shot, but--

19:11.218 --> 19:12.585
- Jordan, talk to me.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.020
Nico Chao, what do you know?

19:14.086 --> 19:15.722
- Yeah, he's popping up
all over the place.

19:15.788 --> 19:21.661
Looks like he's in the heroin
business as well as fentanyl.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.430
- Yeah? Eyes up, people.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.064
- Believed to be one
of the largest supplies

19:25.131 --> 19:28.535
of fentanyl in the Northeastern
corridor of the United States.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.370
I can hook you up
with a current case agent.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.904
He'll have more answers.
- Great.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.072
Please do that.
Thank you.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.507
All right, folks.
We now have a name.

19:34.574 --> 19:35.908
We now have a target--
Nico Chao.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.277
Let's get to work.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.712
Figure out who this man is
and how we nail his ass.

19:39.779 --> 19:43.516
* *

19:49.422 --> 19:50.557
- I've been a DEA agent here

19:50.623 --> 19:51.724
in New York
for the past ten years.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.660
Nico's been on our radar
that whole time.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.328
- Really?
Hard guy to take down.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.730
- Yeah, the problem is,
he never touches product,

19:57.797 --> 19:59.031
so every time we'd try
to bring a case against him,

19:59.098 --> 20:00.433
it got kicked.
- Don't worry.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.601
I'm gonna change that.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.202
- Your lips to God's ears.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.405
He currently supplies
most of lower New York,

20:05.472 --> 20:07.840
so if he's taken off the board,
the city's a better place.

20:07.907 --> 20:08.675
- Sure.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.042
So how do we find him?

20:10.109 --> 20:11.578
- He lives
atop a little club he owns

20:11.644 --> 20:14.547
over in Soho called Luna's,
but spends most of his time

20:14.614 --> 20:15.615
in the Plaza uptown.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.484
- The Plaza? Why?

20:17.550 --> 20:18.585
- Field of view.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.287
He and his people control it.

20:20.353 --> 20:23.089
One of them sees a strange
face, the deal-making halts.

20:23.155 --> 20:25.725
So like I said, he's not
an easy guy to approach.

20:25.792 --> 20:29.095
- Maybe, but we got a bag
of fentanyl to play with.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.364
- Stolen bag of fentanyl?

20:31.431 --> 20:32.365
It's a risky play.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.700
- We got what we got.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.635
- Drinks on me if you get him.

20:38.204 --> 20:39.806
- You know, I think
this DEA guy's right.

20:39.872 --> 20:40.807
This is a risky play.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.208
- Nico's a businessman.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.810
He cares more about money
than violence,

20:43.876 --> 20:45.612
so I'm guessing
he'd be open to a deal.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.314
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.815
- How are you?
- I'm good.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.583
How are you?
How's white collar?

20:50.650 --> 20:52.785
- Oh, it's good.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.086
I lied.
It's very boring.

20:54.153 --> 20:55.888
[both chuckle]

20:55.955 --> 20:57.189
Hey, do you have a sec?

20:57.256 --> 20:58.391
- Yeah.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.360
- Good to see you.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.628
I don't want to bother you,

21:01.694 --> 21:02.862
I just wanted to see
if you had a moment

21:02.929 --> 21:04.063
to check out the document.
- No, I haven't.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.333
Sorry.
This has been an intense day.

21:06.399 --> 21:08.501
- Yeah, I heard about
the lobby this morning.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.169
- Yeah, kid's trying
to fix things

21:10.236 --> 21:11.871
with his deadbeat father.

21:11.938 --> 21:15.007
Heart's in the right place,
head's another matter.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.543
- Okay, well, I--

21:16.609 --> 21:22.214
I just want to clarify that
this isn't about me and you.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.683
- Oh, no?

21:23.750 --> 21:25.251
- No, I just--

21:25.318 --> 21:26.886
I'm just trying
to do what's best for me

21:26.953 --> 21:29.188
and the baby, and not have
to worry about logistics.

21:29.255 --> 21:32.291
- Yeah, I just, uh,
I need some more time.

21:32.359 --> 21:33.893
[soft music]

21:33.960 --> 21:35.728
- Okay, well, I appreciate
the way you're handling it,

21:35.795 --> 21:37.864
and it's just a document, okay?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.599
Nothing set in stone.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.634
- I'm gonna go set up
an undercover buy,

21:41.701 --> 21:43.370
so I gotta get going.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.637
- Okay.

21:44.704 --> 21:50.643
* *

21:50.710 --> 21:53.112
- All right, suspect
and another male Asian

21:53.179 --> 21:55.014
are on the east end
of the Plaza.

21:55.081 --> 21:59.251
- Scola is landing now, Tiff.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.587
- Copy that.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.924
[tense music]

22:04.991 --> 22:09.095
Hey, Scola,
that guy that's with Nico?

22:09.161 --> 22:10.597
Pretty sure that's the same guy
that ran from us

22:10.663 --> 22:12.298
earlier at the apartment.

22:12.365 --> 22:13.700
- We're good.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.402
- Yeah, but he saw us.

22:15.468 --> 22:16.969
- We're good.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.741
My name's Stuart.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.242
- I know you?

22:23.309 --> 22:24.577
- No.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.813
- Then we don't got
anything to talk about.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.748
- I get that.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.149
But--
- But what?

22:33.920 --> 22:36.355
- I got a bag of fentanyl.
Five kilos.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.290
Used to belong
to some dude named Vince.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.326
Now it belongs to me.

22:40.393 --> 22:42.762
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:42.829 --> 22:44.597
- His kid sold it
to me this morning.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.098
Told me his dad got killed.

22:46.165 --> 22:48.735
He found all this dope
in his car.

22:48.801 --> 22:52.104
I bought it from him
at a discount.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.441
You know what
I'm talking about now?

22:56.375 --> 22:58.411
Look, I had no idea
what went down

22:58.478 --> 23:01.514
or how this kid came
into possession of it.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.015
Till he came clean, that is.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.784
- So why not just sell
what he gave you?

23:04.851 --> 23:06.085
Why come here?

23:06.152 --> 23:08.955
- Because I don't want
bad blood with you.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.993
I'd like to make things right.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.795
- Want to make things right?
All right.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.564
Return whatever was taken.

23:17.630 --> 23:18.998
- I will.

23:19.065 --> 23:21.701
But I'm gonna need some
sort of compensation.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.169
Call it a finder's fee.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.336
- [scoffs]

23:24.403 --> 23:25.371
- You asking to
get paid to return

23:25.438 --> 23:26.939
someone else's property?

23:29.642 --> 23:30.910
- Scola?

23:30.977 --> 23:32.378
You got more players
entering the Plaza.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.080
I say you cut your losses
and start walking.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.114
Now.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.453
- All right, look, look.

23:42.154 --> 23:45.792
I think this could be
a good thing for both of us.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.293
- How's that?

23:47.359 --> 23:50.463
- I've been looking
for a supplier.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.898
You and me can work this out.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.733
I'm thinking maybe
we could do some business.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.035
I got a lot of clients
out west.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.304
These people are thirsty
for fentanyl.

23:59.906 --> 24:02.074
- I run a club.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.511
You and your West Coast friends
want a drink?

24:04.577 --> 24:06.078
Come in any time.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.880
About this stuff
you're talking about?

24:07.947 --> 24:10.016
I ain't involved
in any of that.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.084
- Time to go, homey.
- All right. Okay.

24:12.151 --> 24:13.486
That's not a problem.

24:13.553 --> 24:15.588
But you've gotta work
with me here a little bit.

24:15.655 --> 24:18.124
That's it, all right?
That's all I'm asking.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.330
- I ain't never
seen you before, bro.

24:24.396 --> 24:27.166
So I need assurances.
- Yeah? Like what?

24:27.233 --> 24:30.670
- Like the kid, Vince's son.

24:30.737 --> 24:34.874
I want to talk to him and you
together this afternoon.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.744
5:00 p.m. at Luna's,
before they open.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.846
If this story makes sense,

24:39.912 --> 24:44.150
we'll work it out
and make this right.

24:44.216 --> 24:45.317
- Okay.

24:48.254 --> 24:49.689
See you at 5:00.

24:49.756 --> 24:56.863
* *

25:08.040 --> 25:09.542
- I don't like it, Scola.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.143
- But he's a businessman.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.312
He can't afford to just
write off that much product.

25:13.379 --> 25:15.047
- He's also a serious
drug dealer

25:15.114 --> 25:16.482
who's not afraid
to use violence.

25:16.549 --> 25:18.317
- You're taking on a lot
of risk here, Stuart.

25:18.384 --> 25:19.552
So is Trevor.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.253
- We're not gonna
bring the drugs inside.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.089
Trevor can tell his story,
okay?

25:23.155 --> 25:26.158
Vouch for me, apologize to Nico
for what his father did.

25:26.225 --> 25:27.660
And then if the guy
wants to do business,

25:27.727 --> 25:30.129
we'll tell him we'll meet up
later on with the product,

25:30.196 --> 25:32.965
in the Plaza, out in the open,
so it's more safe.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.135
- Okay. Let's do it.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.104
But there better
be plenty of backup.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.548
- Are you sure about this?

25:49.616 --> 25:53.219
- Of course not,
but I think we can pull it off.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.154
- Why are you pushing so hard
to make this happen?

25:55.221 --> 25:58.257
- Building a case against
a guy selling poison.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.926
Part of the job,
last I checked.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.994
- You sure us the only reason?

26:02.061 --> 26:03.429
- What are you
getting at, Tiff?

26:03.495 --> 26:04.897
- It just seems
like you're really invested

26:04.964 --> 26:06.799
in this kid, Trevor.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.268
- Yeah, I suppose so.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.771
Seems like a good kid.
He's trying to save his father.

26:11.838 --> 26:14.941
- But you can't save somebody
who doesn't want to be saved.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.809
- That's fair enough.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.811
It's not our problem.

26:18.878 --> 26:20.747
Not right now, anyway.

26:20.813 --> 26:24.150
All right, let's
go talk to Trevor.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.152
See if this kid
wants to play ball.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.023
- I'll do whatever
it takes to get me

26:31.090 --> 26:32.625
and my father out of this mess.

26:32.692 --> 26:33.893
- You sure?

26:33.960 --> 26:35.294
I mean, there's a lot
of risks involved

26:35.361 --> 26:38.798
and we can't make
any guarantees.

26:38.865 --> 26:41.801
- I know.

26:41.868 --> 26:43.335
But just in case
things don't go well,

26:43.402 --> 26:44.904
I want to see my father
one more time.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.472
- No, that's not a good idea.

26:46.538 --> 26:48.440
- He's all I got, man.

26:48.507 --> 26:52.879
If something happens, I at
least want to know that I--

26:52.945 --> 26:55.281
[apprehensive music]

26:55.347 --> 26:57.483
It's been years since I told
my father I love him.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.553
So I need to--
- Okay.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.554
I get it.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.292
We don't have a lot of time,

27:06.358 --> 27:07.593
so we're gonna make this quick.

27:11.030 --> 27:14.033
- Five more days?

27:14.100 --> 27:16.803
- Yeah, the doctor says
they want the wounds

27:16.869 --> 27:19.171
to heal the right way,
you know?

27:19.238 --> 27:22.041
He says I could die
if the sutures open up.

27:23.442 --> 27:25.411
- This kid Trevor
is unbelievable, man.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.513
- Okay, well,
then just do what he says.

27:27.579 --> 27:30.717
- Yeah, I don't
really have a choice.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.351
Hey, where's that bag
of mine, by the way?

27:32.418 --> 27:34.653
- It's in a closet
at my friend's apartment.

27:35.955 --> 27:37.189
- What friend?

27:38.557 --> 27:39.992
- Carlos.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.563
- You seem nervous.

27:44.630 --> 27:45.564
- No.

27:45.631 --> 27:46.699
I--I'm good.

27:46.766 --> 27:49.235
- Yeah? Are you sure?

27:50.937 --> 27:54.673
Because it feels like you
got something on your mind--

27:54.741 --> 27:56.375
something you want to say.

27:59.611 --> 28:01.113
- That I just wanted to--

28:02.749 --> 28:04.416
- You wanted to what?

28:06.585 --> 28:08.154
- To tell you--

28:11.657 --> 28:15.294
I know we don't talk about
our feelings, you know?

28:15.361 --> 28:16.395
But I just want you
to know that--

28:16.462 --> 28:18.831
- Hey, hey.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.833
When'd you get this chain?

28:20.900 --> 28:22.168
- What are you doing?

28:23.602 --> 28:25.104
- Where'd you get the money
to pay for this chain?

28:26.238 --> 28:28.674
- Okay, time to get out
of there.

28:28.741 --> 28:31.077
- It's--it's fake.

28:31.143 --> 28:33.079
I've had it for months.

28:33.145 --> 28:36.582
[suspenseful music]

28:36.648 --> 28:43.489
* *

28:43.555 --> 28:45.124
- So go sit on
that bag and don't

28:45.191 --> 28:47.794
come back here anymore, okay?
You understand?

28:52.031 --> 28:54.366
- Just nod and walk out.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.706
- I'm doing this for us.

29:00.773 --> 29:02.441
- Doing what?

29:02.508 --> 29:03.442
What are you--
what are you doing?

29:03.509 --> 29:04.844
What is that supposed to mean?

29:04.911 --> 29:06.512
- Trevor, get out now.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.580
- I--I--

29:08.647 --> 29:11.550
I just wanted to say that--
- No, no, no more talking.

29:11.617 --> 29:18.524
* *

29:38.310 --> 29:39.645
- All right,
let's go over the script.

29:39.711 --> 29:41.914
You remember what
you're supposed to say?

29:41.981 --> 29:44.016
- My father's dead.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.484
I found the product,
sold it to you.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.353
- And you know him how?

29:47.419 --> 29:49.555
- I used to sell weed from him
when I was in high school,

29:49.621 --> 29:51.457
and now I work
at his bar in Tribeca.

29:51.523 --> 29:53.225
- What else?

29:53.292 --> 29:57.196
- I need to apologize to Nico
for what my father did.

29:57.263 --> 29:59.065
And say I want
to make things right.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.467
- And I'll take it from there.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.369
- Let's do this.

30:03.435 --> 30:04.603
- Come on.

[suspenseful music]

30:07.639 --> 30:12.811

30:12.879 --> 30:14.746

are on 11th Street.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.182
Are you two set?

30:16.248 --> 30:18.417
- Ready to move in
on your signal, Scola.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.887
- Copy that.
Any sign of Nico or his people?

30:20.953 --> 30:22.388
- Negative.

30:22.454 --> 30:23.856
Place has been pretty quiet
since we got here.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.557
No one in or out.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.359
- Remember, use the fear,
all right?

30:27.426 --> 30:29.295
He's gonna want to hear it
in your voice.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.597
- I don't think that's
gonna to be a problem.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.566
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

30:34.633 --> 30:35.734
- Deep breath.

That's it.

You good?

Hello.

30:49.515 --> 30:50.682
Anybody here?

30:50.749 --> 30:53.385
- Scola, I don't like this.

30:53.452 --> 30:54.353
This feels like a setup.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.125

Where you at?

Where's Scola?

31:35.494 --> 31:36.428
- He's back there.

31:36.495 --> 31:37.796
- Go stand with Tiff, now.

31:37.863 --> 31:39.298
Get out of here.
- You okay?

31:41.333 --> 31:42.801
- You just stay relaxed.

- Come on. Let's go.

31:47.839 --> 31:48.740
- All right,
can you talk to me?

31:48.807 --> 31:50.109
Can you me who did this?

31:51.877 --> 31:52.945

- Yes.

32:06.892 --> 32:08.160
I hid when
the shooting started.

32:08.227 --> 32:09.728
- Did you see who did it?
- No.

32:09.795 --> 32:11.363
Not his face.
He had a mask on.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.532
- There was just one man?
- I think so.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.534
I hid behind here as soon
as he started shooting.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.137
I kept hiding because I thought
you guys were with him.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.274
- Okay.

32:22.341 --> 32:23.509
- Wounds went through
and through.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.044
No vital organs were damaged.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.112
- Which means
we won't have answers

32:26.178 --> 32:27.179
until they're out of surgery.

32:27.246 --> 32:28.780

with the witness canvas?

32:28.847 --> 32:30.182
- Looks like the shooter
snuck in

32:30.249 --> 32:31.917
through the service entrance,
left the same way.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.889
- The waitress showed me
multiple security cameras.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.358
I think you're gonna
want to see this.

32:42.228 --> 32:45.131
These two cameras cover the
back hallway and the DJ booth.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.965
- Okay. Think they got
a look at our shooter?

32:47.033 --> 32:48.834
- Yeah. Take a look.

32:48.900 --> 32:55.907
* *

32:57.576 --> 32:59.345
And then he goes here.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.384
- Can't see his face.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.719
- What's he doing?
- He's looking for something.

33:07.786 --> 33:09.521
- Let me speed it up.

33:13.959 --> 33:15.461
He's white.

33:15.527 --> 33:16.528
Bet he left some prints.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.564
- I'll get ERT
to start dusting.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.766
- This guy knows exactly where
the hidden compartment is.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.234
- He must be an insider.

33:22.301 --> 33:23.769
- Oh, that's a bold move,
robbing the boss.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.571
[phone rings]

33:25.637 --> 33:27.839
- Hey, Scola.
- Jubal, what's up?

33:27.906 --> 33:29.241
- I just got a call.

33:29.308 --> 33:31.677
Vince Logan left the hospital
two hours ago.

33:31.743 --> 33:33.312
- What, he just up and left?

33:33.379 --> 33:35.181
- Well, apparently
he snuck out the back door.

33:35.247 --> 33:36.615
- Hey, Scola,
check Trevor's phone.

33:36.682 --> 33:37.783
Maybe Vince reached out to him.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.318
- I doubt that.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.587
- What do you mean?
Why do you say that?

33:41.653 --> 33:44.523
- Vince Logan just shot Nico
and his lieutenant.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.129
- You really think
he's the one that did this?

33:50.196 --> 33:52.264
- We do.

33:52.331 --> 33:53.432
- Why would he--

33:53.499 --> 33:54.766
- It was that last visit,
Trevor.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.702
The questions, the chain.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.304
He sensed what was going on--

33:58.370 --> 34:00.406
that you were working
with law enforcement.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.674
So he grabbed,
or tried to grab,

34:02.741 --> 34:05.677
all the money and dope that
he could and make a run for it.

34:05.744 --> 34:08.980
- Then why did he--

34:09.047 --> 34:10.582
I was trying to fix things.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.251
[sniffling]

34:12.318 --> 34:16.922
[apprehensive music]

34:16.988 --> 34:18.790
- Hey.

34:18.857 --> 34:21.460
Hang in there, Trevor.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.795
We still need your help.

34:23.862 --> 34:30.969
* *

34:37.042 --> 34:38.277
- You find any video
outside the bar?

34:38.344 --> 34:40.379
- Yeah, we got a shot
of the service entrance.

34:40.446 --> 34:42.148
This is moments
after the shooting.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.915
[tense music]

34:43.982 --> 34:45.917
- Okay, okay. Let's go tighter.

34:50.789 --> 34:51.957
Come on.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.527
Scola was right.
Vince Logan is the shooter.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.795
- Elise, run that plate.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.130
- On it.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.401
- Okay, Kelly?
Roll it back.

35:02.468 --> 35:03.902
- Yeah.

35:06.638 --> 35:07.973
- Play it here.

35:08.039 --> 35:14.313
* *

35:14.380 --> 35:16.348
Okay, freeze it.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.617
There's blood on his shirt.
His wounds have opened up.

35:18.684 --> 35:19.985
- Shows it was stolen
an hour ago,

35:20.051 --> 35:21.520
half a block from the hospital.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.121
- Can we access its GPS?
- On it.

35:23.189 --> 35:25.757
- It is over
in Kew Gardens and...

35:27.259 --> 35:28.627
The vehicle is not moving.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.262
- All right, get agents
over there now.

35:30.329 --> 35:36.168
* *

35:36.235 --> 35:38.370
- Stay in the car.

35:38.437 --> 35:39.571
FBI!

35:39.638 --> 35:41.973
Put your weapon down.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.943
- [panting]

35:48.046 --> 35:50.649
- Come on, Vince.
You got nowhere to go.

35:52.584 --> 35:53.952
- Get back!

35:54.019 --> 35:55.587
- Look, you need
medical attention, Vince.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.723
Put the gun down.
We'll get you some help.

35:57.789 --> 35:59.958
- You look--I'm not going back
to jail, all right?

36:01.427 --> 36:02.794
I mean it.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.964
[gunshots]
[all shouting]

36:06.031 --> 36:13.171
* *

36:13.805 --> 36:14.906
- All right, let's
just wait him out.

36:14.973 --> 36:17.576
He's losing blood.
- Works for me.

36:17.643 --> 36:18.810
I told you to stay in the car.

36:18.877 --> 36:21.046
- He's bleeding.
He's going to die.

36:21.112 --> 36:23.582
- Trying to talk to him, but--
- Let me talk to him.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.617
I can convince him
to surrender.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.620
He's my father.
He'll listen to me.

36:28.687 --> 36:35.561
* *

36:35.627 --> 36:36.762
- All right.

36:38.364 --> 36:40.666
We're gonna to do this,

36:40.732 --> 36:42.668
you are at my side
the entire time.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.336
You understand me?

36:44.403 --> 36:45.804
- Yeah.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.673
Don't worry. I got this.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.010
- Slow.

36:55.146 --> 36:56.081
- Dad!

36:56.147 --> 36:57.416
It's me!

36:57.483 --> 36:58.850
- Get out of here, Trevor!

36:58.917 --> 37:01.687
- Please,
just do what they say.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.154
- No, kid, get out of here.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.524
You messed this
whole damn thing up!

37:05.591 --> 37:06.958
What do you think I am, dumb?

37:07.025 --> 37:09.361
Think I wouldn't figure out
what you were doing?

37:09.428 --> 37:10.596
- I tried to help.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.764
- Yeah, well,
you did the opposite.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.132
- No, no, no.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.870
Listen to your kid, Vince.

37:20.772 --> 37:23.309
Nico and his buddy
are gonna be all right.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.511
You're looking at
an armed robbery charge

37:25.577 --> 37:26.545
for two dope dealers.

37:26.612 --> 37:28.046
The way things are going here,

37:28.113 --> 37:31.182
you might not even
have to post bail.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.552
- He's right.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.754
We can still fix this.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.989
- But you gotta surrender now.

37:42.093 --> 37:44.663
Snipers are in place, Vince.

37:46.565 --> 37:50.268
Hey, your son, he's smart.

37:51.537 --> 37:53.605
He cares about you.

37:53.672 --> 37:56.107
Please just listen to him.

37:59.010 --> 38:02.180
Be the father
that he thinks you are.

38:02.247 --> 38:09.187
* *

38:14.626 --> 38:16.127
- No!

38:16.194 --> 38:19.264
[gunfire]

38:20.832 --> 38:24.336
[breathing shakily]

38:24.403 --> 38:31.309
* *

38:31.377 --> 38:35.080
[sobbing]

38:55.333 --> 38:56.502
I screwed up.

38:56.568 --> 38:58.169
[somber music]

38:58.236 --> 39:00.772
I never should have brought
that bag to your office.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.476
I thought it was
the right thing to do, but--

39:04.543 --> 39:05.877
- It was.

39:07.513 --> 39:10.982
That fentanyl would've
destroyed a lot of lives.

39:13.985 --> 39:16.321
This wasn't your fault, Trevor.

39:20.626 --> 39:23.895
- I never even got a chance
to say I love him.

39:23.962 --> 39:31.102
* *

39:40.011 --> 39:42.448
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:45.116 --> 39:47.553
- I heard you had
a pretty rough day.

39:47.619 --> 39:49.287
- Yeah.

39:49.354 --> 39:50.321
It, uh...

39:52.558 --> 39:54.760
It wasn't the outcome
we'd hoped for.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.295
But...

39:57.362 --> 39:58.296
- I'm sorry.

40:02.668 --> 40:05.303
- I can't sign that, Nina.

40:05.370 --> 40:07.773
I'm sorry.

40:07.839 --> 40:11.610
But I'm this baby's father.

40:11.677 --> 40:15.313
That little boy or little girl
is gonna need me.

40:17.248 --> 40:21.453
They're gonna need to know
that their father loved them.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.722
[soft pensive music]

40:23.789 --> 40:26.525
- I'm not saying that--
- I get what you're asking.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.829
I can't do it.

40:30.896 --> 40:33.999
I cannot waive my right.

40:34.065 --> 40:36.668
- Okay, but then I--
- I'll work with you.

40:36.735 --> 40:40.405
I will give you
the flexibility that you need.

40:42.708 --> 40:44.910
But I need to be there.

40:49.715 --> 40:52.984
It's non-negotiable for me.

40:53.051 --> 40:59.090
* *

40:59.157 --> 41:01.126
- [exhales shakily]

41:04.395 --> 41:05.363
Okay.

41:08.033 --> 41:11.202
We can see how it goes.

41:13.404 --> 41:15.507
- Thank you.

41:15.574 --> 41:16.642
- Yeah.

41:16.708 --> 41:23.615
* *

41:24.583 --> 41:26.251
It's a boy.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.452
- What?

41:27.519 --> 41:30.121
- We're having a boy.
- Oh, my God.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.224
That's amazing.

41:33.291 --> 41:34.593
- Mm-hmm.

41:40.065 --> 41:41.567
So maybe--

41:47.505 --> 41:52.077
Maybe we should go to dinner
and talk about baby names.

41:52.143 --> 41:54.112
[chuckles]
- Yeah.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.414
- Yeah?
- I'd like that.

41:56.481 --> 41:58.049
- Okay.

41:58.116 --> 42:05.256
