Face it, mister, we can’t get
the couch up to your office.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.487
It won’t fit in the elevator.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.655
Oh, it’s just great.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.524
I spent a fortune
redecorating my office

01:30.557 --> 01:32.425
around this sofa
and you can’t get it up there?

01:33.927 --> 01:37.531
You hear that, Balki?
Opportunity is knocking.

01:37.564 --> 01:40.233
Well, I have no choice.
Take it back.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.202
N‐no need to take
that couch back, sir.

01:42.235 --> 01:44.638
Uh, it just so happens
that, uh, during college

01:44.671 --> 01:47.808
I worked for the Eight Garibaldi
Brothers Moving Company.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.676
I was so good, uh,
they laid off four brothers.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.581
So you could get
this couch up to my office?

01:54.615 --> 01:56.482
Absolutely, sir.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.451
Is this gonna be
like that time you insisted

01:58.484 --> 02:00.654
on cleaning my aquarium
and got your head stuck in it?

02:02.923 --> 02:04.691
No, it won’t be
anything like that, sir.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.260
I‐I will treat
your couch with TLC.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.695
I have a better idea.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.797
Treat it as if
it meant your J‐O‐B.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.737
R‐E‐S‐P‐E‐C‐T.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.739
Find out what it means to me.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.711
Okay. Good luck
with that couch, sucker.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.547
Whoa!

02:26.580 --> 02:28.615
Oh!

02:28.649 --> 02:30.416
Don’t play with my dolly.

02:35.522 --> 02:36.757
Stop fooling around.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.961
We’ve got a job to do.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.797
Hey, cousin, uh, you never
told me that you were a mover.

02:43.830 --> 02:48.702
Balki, I have never moved
a piece of furniture in my life.

02:48.735 --> 02:50.737
But how hard can it be to get
a couch into an elevator?

02:53.306 --> 02:55.241
Well, that all depends
on how much of the couch

02:55.275 --> 02:56.810
you want to get
into the elevator

02:56.843 --> 02:59.546
and whether or not
you want the doors to shut.

03:00.947 --> 03:02.348
Alright, Balki,
let me explain.

03:02.382 --> 03:04.284
Getting this couch
into the elevator

03:04.317 --> 03:06.587
is all a matter
of finding the magic angle.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.722
Oh, yeah.

03:08.755 --> 03:10.423
Vila, the goat girl, used to say

03:10.456 --> 03:12.192
there was a certain magic
in my ankles.

03:14.561 --> 03:15.529
‐Balki.
‐Yeah?

03:15.562 --> 03:18.431
Just help me get the couch
into the elevator.

03:18.464 --> 03:20.000
Cousin, the only way
you’re gonna get this couch

03:20.033 --> 03:22.368
into that elevator
is to saw it in half.

03:22.402 --> 03:24.505
No, we are not going to saw it
in half.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.940
Oh, yes.
Make a nice set of sectionals.

03:26.973 --> 03:27.808
Perhaps a little end table
with some straw flowers‐‐

03:27.841 --> 03:29.876
We’re not going
to saw it in half.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.445
Balki, what we’re going to do
is take this end

03:32.478 --> 03:35.448
into the elevator
and then lift it up.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.350
Now you take this end,
I will take that end.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.688
Wait a minute.
How come you get the good end?

03:43.657 --> 03:45.892
There is no good end.
Both ends are the same.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.293
‐Oh really?
‐’Yes.’

03:47.327 --> 03:48.494
Then how come
you want that end?

03:48.529 --> 03:50.597
‐No, you take that end.
‐I’m just gonna take a look.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.599
Just take that end.
Look, now alright.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.900
You see, they’re both
the same, alright?

03:53.934 --> 03:55.969
Now you take that end.
You take that end.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.708
I am a citizen of this country.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.377
I can vote. I can choose.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.880
I do not have to take this end!

04:06.913 --> 04:08.849
Please, let me have that end.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.353
‐Alright, fine, take this end.
‐Okay.

04:21.995 --> 04:22.963
Happy?

04:22.996 --> 04:26.466
Well, professionally,
I, I can’t complain

04:26.499 --> 04:30.003
and my personal life
is pretty satisfying

04:30.036 --> 04:33.373
and I’ve got a little money
in the bank

04:33.406 --> 04:37.477
so overall,
I’m gonna say yes, I’m happy.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.648
Glad to hear it.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.050
‐I think spiritually, I’m‐‐
‐Okay, ready? Here we go.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.619
On the count of three,
we’ll lift. Ready?

04:45.652 --> 04:47.854
One, two, three, lift!

04:50.456 --> 04:51.558
Now?

04:52.793 --> 04:53.960
Yes, now.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.063
[grunting]

04:58.665 --> 04:59.800
And circle!

05:05.839 --> 05:09.475
And swing it around.
Just swing it on in.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.378
Just swing it on in
and into the elevator.

05:12.412 --> 05:13.947
I knew I had the bad end.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.685
Alright now, lift.
Lift. Keep lifting.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.421
‐Cousin, cousin, oh, cousin‐‐
‐Lift it up. Lift it up.

05:21.454 --> 05:24.024
‐Stop! Stop pushing!
‐Just lift. Keep lifting.

05:24.057 --> 05:27.594
‐Ah! Ah! Stop pushing!
‐To the left! To the left!

05:27.628 --> 05:30.631
Is it going? Th‐there!
I think I feel it going!

05:30.664 --> 05:33.033
There it goes. There it goes.
You’ve got...

05:33.066 --> 05:35.001
‐Ow! Ow! Ow!
‐’Stop pushing!’

05:38.972 --> 05:39.973
[gasps]

05:41.875 --> 05:44.077
Aah! Ah!

05:45.546 --> 05:47.514
What is it? What’s wrong?
What’s wrong?

05:47.548 --> 05:50.784
‐Foot!
‐’Foot?’

05:50.817 --> 05:52.786
‐Foot!
‐Oh, your foot!

05:52.819 --> 05:53.920
[groans]

05:55.622 --> 05:56.957
It’s caught under the couch!

05:56.990 --> 05:59.159
You‐you’ve got to get it
out from under the couch!

05:59.192 --> 06:02.028
‐Ow, ow, ow.
‐Get it off!

06:05.832 --> 06:08.468
Oh!

06:08.502 --> 06:09.736
Are you alright?

06:11.938 --> 06:13.874
[grunting]

06:18.679 --> 06:19.913
‐Cousin, cousin.
‐Huh?

06:19.946 --> 06:21.815
‐What is it?
‐Cousin, you know what?

06:21.848 --> 06:23.416
You know what?
This isn’t working.

06:23.449 --> 06:25.118
I think you’re right.

06:25.151 --> 06:27.487
Cousin, why we don’t
just tell Mr. Wainwright

06:27.521 --> 06:29.890
that the couch don’t fit
in the elevator?

06:29.923 --> 06:34.194
Balki, we are not quitters.
We are not shirkers.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.597
‐We are not slackers.
‐We are not movers.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.736
Please, please, just...
You’ve got to help me.

06:42.769 --> 06:44.771
I’ve got to convince
Mr. Wainwright

06:44.805 --> 06:45.972
I am not an idiot.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.073
Good luck.

06:49.009 --> 06:52.613
I can’t believe he remembered
the aquarium thing.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.181
Cousin, I didn’t wanna say
anything at the time

06:55.215 --> 06:57.818
but that was pretty stupid.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.989
Good thing for you,
I had that snorkel in my desk.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.491
And if you could be
just as helpful this time

07:05.526 --> 07:07.594
I’d appreciate it.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.629
Okay.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.933
You know, the thing is
if we could just get rid

07:12.966 --> 07:15.135
of the ceiling,
the couch would fit in there.

07:21.675 --> 07:26.012
That is the stupidest idea
I have ever heard.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.481
Balki, you’re a genius!

07:31.184 --> 07:33.119
Kind of a mixed message,
isn’t it?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.557
Sort of like jumbo shrimp.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.991
No, no, no, no.

07:38.024 --> 07:41.628
Balki, Balki,
that is a brilliant idea!

07:41.662 --> 07:44.531
Uh, if the couch won’t fit
into the elevator

07:44.565 --> 07:47.033
we’ll put the couch
on top of the elevator!

07:48.602 --> 07:50.136
Was that my idea?

07:52.238 --> 07:54.975
Funny, that don’t sound
like me.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.843
Just help me get the couch
out of the elevator.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.679
‐Well, I’m just taking‐‐
‐You take that end.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.846
‐I want this, this is my end.
‐Take that end.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.814
Just take that end!

08:00.847 --> 08:02.816
I haven’t even taken
a look at this end.

08:02.849 --> 08:04.651
Let me just check it out.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.588
[grunting]

08:22.869 --> 08:25.739
Now I have sent the elevator
down one floor.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.541
I’ll pry the doors open

08:27.574 --> 08:29.943
and then we’ll load the couch
on top of the elevator.

08:39.284 --> 08:44.725
Cousin, since this was my idea,
I hereby withdraw my idea.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.594
Balki, it’ll be fine.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.896
Now to make this work,
we’re going to

08:49.930 --> 08:52.599
have to stop the elevator on 15.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.802
Yeah, but Mr. Wainwright’s
office is, is on 16.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.605
I know that, Balki, that is why
we have to stop the elevator

08:58.639 --> 09:02.643
at 15, so we can unload
the couch at 16.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.678
Now get on top of the elevator
and help me pull the couch in.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.247
I’m not gonna get on top
of the elevator!

09:07.280 --> 09:08.815
Just get on top of the elevator.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.016
I’m not gonna get on top
of the elevator.

09:10.050 --> 09:10.917
Get on top of the elevator!

09:10.951 --> 09:12.152
I’m not gonna get on top
of the elevator!

09:12.185 --> 09:13.386
Look it, I don’t even know
if it can support my weight!

09:13.419 --> 09:15.556
Get on top of the elevator
and help me pull this couch in.

09:15.589 --> 09:16.957
I don’t even know if
it’s gonna su
pport my weight.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.092
Just get on top.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.561
Ouch!

09:22.195 --> 09:23.096
What if something goes wrong?

09:23.129 --> 09:26.132
Don’t be silly.
Nothing can go wrong.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.035
You always say that
right before things go wrong!

09:29.069 --> 09:30.804
What are you talking about?

09:33.840 --> 09:36.109
(Balki)
’Cousin, this has fish tank
written all over it.’

09:38.211 --> 09:40.146
[intense music]

10:06.339 --> 10:08.241
Well, at least
we learned the route.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.245
‐Yes, yes, we did.
‐Hm.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.814
And I have every reason
to believe

10:13.847 --> 10:16.216
it will go just as smoothly
with the couch

10:16.249 --> 10:18.218
on top of the elevator.
Help me pick up the couch.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.986
You know, this would
never happen on Mypos.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.888
‐Why, no elevators?
‐No, no couches.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.059
It’s also the reason
we have no talk shows.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.130
Help me pick up the couch.
You take that end.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.665
‐I like this end.
‐You take that end.

10:31.698 --> 10:33.299
‐That end stinks.
‐Take that end.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.268
‐I’ve had that end.
‐Please, just take that end.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.303
‐I wanna take this end.
‐Alright, alright, never mind.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.371
I’ll do it myself.
I’ll do it myself.

10:38.404 --> 10:40.240
‐I’m gonna help you.
‐Aah!

10:48.481 --> 10:50.216
Phase one, complete.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.218
We are on our way to the top.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.821
Correct me if I’m wrong,
but don’t the phrase

10:54.855 --> 10:57.891
on our way to the top
imply movement?

11:00.293 --> 11:04.064
Okay, I forgot
to push the button.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.434
Little snag, no big deal.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.806
I’ll just climb down
into the elevator

11:12.839 --> 11:14.708
through this little trap door...

11:17.177 --> 11:19.412
...press 15
and we’ll be on our way.

11:19.445 --> 11:21.748
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait, wait.

11:21.782 --> 11:25.085
How come I, I can’t climb down
through the little trap door?

11:25.118 --> 11:27.053
Because someone has to stay
up here with the couch.

11:28.955 --> 11:31.157
[grunting]

11:31.191 --> 11:32.458
Cousin, cousin, cousin.

11:34.327 --> 11:38.765
I‐I, I‐I don’t wanna stay
up here alone with the couch.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.901
‐It’s scary.
‐Okay, okay, fine.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.235
Ow. Ow.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.739
I’ll stay up here
with the couch.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.073
You climb down
into the elevator.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.274
Alrighty.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.248
Ooh.

11:55.281 --> 11:57.317
I’m not staying up here.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.451
It’s too scary.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.155
We’ll both go down.
You go down first. Go ahead.

12:05.391 --> 12:08.929
Okay, I got ya. I got ya.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.330
[thud]

12:13.399 --> 12:15.135
(Balki)
’Oww!’

12:17.037 --> 12:19.873
Okay, Phil, I just came up
from the sub‐basement.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.876
The elevator’s at the bottom
of the shaft and it’s empty.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.779
We’re ready for the test.

12:25.812 --> 12:28.081
Let’s see how much punishment
this baby can take.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.786
[intense music]

12:47.233 --> 12:50.003
‐’Okay, alright.’
‐Okay.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.071
‐I got you.
‐’Okay. okay.’

12:51.104 --> 12:52.238
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.373
‐Yep, yep.
‐’Keep goin’.’

12:53.406 --> 12:55.942
‐Hang on alright, good.
‐Okay, alright. Okey‐dokey.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.444
‐Okay. Alright. Alright.
‐Okay.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.946
‐Alright, just help me down.
‐Just let her drop.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.047
‐Help me down.
‐Cousin, it’s one foot.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.348
‐Help me down!
‐It’s a foot!

13:02.382 --> 13:03.449
‐Just one foot!
‐Just help me down!

13:03.483 --> 13:05.519
‐Just drop! Just let go!
‐Just help me!

13:05.552 --> 13:06.587
‐Let go. Alright, alright.
‐Just help me...

13:06.620 --> 13:08.354
[laughing]

13:12.292 --> 13:15.161
Now I’ll just press 15
and we’ll be on our way.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.504
Well, I’ll be snookered.
It’s working.

13:23.537 --> 13:25.271
I may just have to eat my worms.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.975
‐Words.
‐Worms.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.044
‐Words.
‐Worms.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.413
You might just have
to eat your words.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.282
Cousin, on Mypos,
when you doubt someone

13:36.316 --> 13:39.152
and later on you find out
that they were right

13:39.185 --> 13:40.921
you have to eat your worms.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.559
They’re a good source
of protein, but, uh...

13:47.628 --> 13:51.231
...it’s a long, long time
before you doubt someone again.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.039
All connections
and overrides have been made.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.307
Let’s, uh, take it up
to the tenth floor.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.952
What was that?

14:11.985 --> 14:14.287
‐We’ve stopped.
‐Yeah, I know that.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.623
But we’re supposed to be
going to floor number 15

14:16.657 --> 14:18.391
and we’re only on number 10.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.662
Something’s wrong.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.330
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe

14:24.364 --> 14:26.232
someone pressed the button
at 10 to get on?

14:28.702 --> 14:31.905
Did it ever occur to you

14:31.938 --> 14:35.208
that the usual sequence
of elevator events

14:35.241 --> 14:37.210
is someone pushes the button...

14:38.645 --> 14:41.214
...the doors open
and someone gets in?

14:47.521 --> 14:48.889
What’s your point?

14:52.258 --> 14:56.029
My point is the doors didn’t
open. Something’s wrong!

14:56.062 --> 14:58.699
Everything is fine.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.267
I’ll just press the button
and we’ll be on our way again.

15:03.336 --> 15:06.072
Okay, let’s test the brakes.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.241
Let it drop, uh, three floors.

15:09.710 --> 15:11.344
Here we go.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.313
[both screaming]

15:24.490 --> 15:25.692
What was that?

15:28.328 --> 15:30.163
I don’t know.
But it seems to be over.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.132
Let’s not dwell on it.

15:33.567 --> 15:35.368
Let’s just get
the hell out of here.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.473
Okay, Phil,
let’s really test the brakes.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.443
Take her up 10 floors
and drop her all the way down.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.249
There.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.318
Everything seems to be fine.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.389
Everything seems
to be fine to me.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.527
Everything seem fine to you?

16:02.328 --> 16:03.129
No.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.034
Except I can take
some small comfort

16:08.068 --> 16:11.337
from having just figured out
what is going on here.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.740
‐You know what’s going on here?
‐Well, of course, I do.

16:13.774 --> 16:15.075
Don’t be ridiculous.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.378
This elevator is possessed.

16:20.547 --> 16:21.715
What?

16:21.748 --> 16:25.251
I saw the very same thing
in a Stephen King movie once.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.220
Only the elevator was a car

16:27.253 --> 16:29.590
it didn’t have a couch on top
of it and we weren’t in it.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.326
But aside from that,
it was the exact same thing

16:33.359 --> 16:34.761
that’s happening here right now.

16:34.795 --> 16:37.130
This elevator wants to kill us.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.532
Next stop, hell!

16:41.802 --> 16:46.106
Balki, that is the dumbest thing
I have ever heard.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.074
[both screaming]

17:16.402 --> 17:18.771
[groaning]

17:18.805 --> 17:19.806
Balki!

17:21.541 --> 17:24.077
This elevator is possessed!

17:24.109 --> 17:25.411
We’re gonna die!

17:25.444 --> 17:28.281
We’re gonna die!
We’re gonna die!

17:28.314 --> 17:31.818
I‐I hate this elevator!
I hate it! I hate it!

17:31.852 --> 17:33.587
I hate it! I hate...

17:38.358 --> 17:41.695
You are hysterical. Now calm
down. I’m going to handle this.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.664
I’m going to talk
to the elevator.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.669
I have a way
with mechanical objects.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.075
Hello, Mr. Elevator.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.580
May I call you Otis?

18:04.184 --> 18:08.354
Otis, I know how you must feel.

18:08.388 --> 18:13.293
All day long, up and down,
up and down.

18:15.729 --> 18:17.664
Everybody pushing your buttons.

18:23.403 --> 18:27.874
But‐but, Otis, you’re taking it
out on the wrong guys.

18:27.908 --> 18:29.743
We usually take the stairs.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.881
‐Now I was wondering‐‐
‐Balki, wait a minute!

18:34.915 --> 18:37.150
Elevators always have a phone!

18:40.253 --> 18:42.322
Cousin, cousin,
what a great idea

18:42.355 --> 18:44.357
but, but who’s gonna call?

18:44.390 --> 18:46.326
Nobody knows we’re here.

18:48.562 --> 18:51.331
We are going to call out.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.766
Oh, cousin,
that is a good idea.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.234
We’ll call Jennifer
and Mary Anne

18:54.267 --> 18:55.736
and say our last goodbye.

18:55.769 --> 18:58.238
B‐Balki, we are gonna call out
for help.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.740
Cousin, we don’t have time
for that.

18:59.773 --> 19:01.642
We have to call our loved ones

19:01.675 --> 19:03.409
and cancel
our magazine subscriptions.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.713
‐Give me that.
‐No, cousin. I’m calling.

19:06.747 --> 19:08.248
‐I’m calling!
‐I am calling!

19:08.281 --> 19:09.315
‐I am calling!
‐Cousin!

19:09.349 --> 19:10.651
I will give you the phone

19:10.684 --> 19:12.653
when I am finished
with "Muppet Baby" magazine!

19:13.987 --> 19:15.756
‐Give me that.
‐Cousin.

19:15.789 --> 19:17.758
Not until I cancel "Kermit."

19:19.926 --> 19:21.194
Oh, God.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.566
The line’s been cut.

19:29.570 --> 19:31.505
[grunting]

19:34.340 --> 19:36.242
Phil, the override checks out.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.679
The, uh, brakes seem okay,
but I’m hearing

19:38.712 --> 19:41.548
a kind of high‐pitched noise
coming from the shaft.

19:41.582 --> 19:43.650
[screaming]

19:43.684 --> 19:45.285
I think it’s probably
just the cables

19:45.318 --> 19:47.821
but just to be safe, we should
check the rate of climb.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.824
Let’s, uh, see how fast we can
get this baby to the top.

19:51.792 --> 19:53.760
[intense music]

19:53.794 --> 19:55.729
[grunting]

19:57.764 --> 20:00.967
Balki, we’re moving,
but we’re going much too fast.

20:01.001 --> 20:03.403
What if it doesn’t stop?
What‐what’ll happen to us?

20:03.436 --> 20:06.239
Oh, it’ll stop, cousin,
I guarantee that.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.642
The top of the elevator shaft
is reinforced concrete.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.410
When we arrive,
the car will smash

20:10.443 --> 20:11.912
and we’ll be squashed
like grapes.

20:11.945 --> 20:13.814
This car will be no thicker
than a deck of cards.

20:13.847 --> 20:15.716
So you see, we will stop.
Feel better?

20:17.718 --> 20:18.719
Oh! Oh!

20:20.887 --> 20:22.756
Cousin, would you mind
choking me down there?

20:22.789 --> 20:24.658
Because, you see, any second
the couch is going to come

20:24.691 --> 20:27.293
through the ceiling
right above our heads.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.962
[both screaming]

20:31.431 --> 20:32.498
‐This is much better.
‐Thank you.

20:32.533 --> 20:33.767
You’re welcome.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.707
[crash]

20:47.047 --> 20:49.516
Okay, elevator’s all yours,
Mr. Wainwright.

20:49.550 --> 20:50.684
Thank you.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.659
‐Hi.
‐Hi.

21:14.608 --> 21:17.310
‐How’s it goin’, cousin?
‐Pretty good, Balki.

21:17.343 --> 21:19.079
I think I’ve figured out
how I can get

21:19.112 --> 21:21.715
my half of the money
for Wainwright’s couch.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.950
No vacation this year.

21:23.984 --> 21:26.553
Uh, forget about new tires
for my car.

21:27.921 --> 21:29.856
And sell my bagpipes.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.862
Well...

21:35.896 --> 21:37.631
Alright,
I’ll keep the bagpipes.

21:40.834 --> 21:41.902
Where are you gonna get
your half of the money?

21:41.935 --> 21:43.504
Oh, that’s simple, cousin.

21:43.537 --> 21:45.005
I’m just gonna dip into my

21:45.038 --> 21:47.407
Cousin Larry Appleton
Emergency Relief Fund.

21:48.742 --> 21:50.410
What are you talking about?

21:50.443 --> 21:52.546
Well, every time you try
to impress Mr. Wainwright

21:52.579 --> 21:55.749
lie to Jennifer
or say I have a plan

21:55.782 --> 21:58.051
I put a dollar into this fund.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.553
‐Oh, really?
‐Mm‐hmm.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.922
‐How much do you have?
‐Well, let’s see.

22:03.890 --> 22:07.594
Three dollars,
some Junior Mints and this.

22:09.530 --> 22:11.698
A postcard of a golf course?

22:11.732 --> 22:14.434
If you look down
the ninth fairway

22:14.467 --> 22:16.002
you’ll see the villa I own.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.077
‐Next to the lake?
‐That’s my pool.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.723
[theme music]
