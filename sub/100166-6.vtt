[all] Ooh.

01:07.192 --> 01:10.320
You don't have to do that
every time someone dresses nicely.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.280
Grandpa Danny says it's a house rule.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.909
And he's the best grandpa.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.412
Saying that is also a house rule.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.958
And so is giving your mama kisses
before she heads out.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.919
-Run. Go. Go.
-What?

01:26.002 --> 01:27.128
Go, go, go.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.672
Hey. Remember,
I know where you sleep.

01:32.383 --> 01:33.384
Hey, Deej.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.680
Matt, what are you doing here?

01:37.764 --> 01:40.517
Hey, that's not as friendly
as "It's always open."

01:41.601 --> 01:43.895
You're right. Sorry. It's always open.

01:43.978 --> 01:47.065
I'm headed out with Steve.
So what are you doing here?

01:47.148 --> 01:49.567
Right. I need to talk to you about work.

01:49.651 --> 01:53.655
I think we should start
a concierge vet service.

01:53.738 --> 01:57.450
Doing house calls for people too lazy
to bring their pets to our office?

01:58.952 --> 02:02.122
Yes, exactly. I think it'll bring in
a ton of extra dough.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.040
Also sounds like a ton of extra hours

02:04.124 --> 02:07.085
that'll take me away from the things
I really care about, like my kids

02:07.168 --> 02:08.545
and my friends and...

02:08.628 --> 02:11.131
right now, my date, so I'll pass.

02:11.214 --> 02:15.593
Wish I had known that
before I printed 50 of these bad boys.

02:17.345 --> 02:18.972
You're right. They're bad.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.062
Matt!

02:26.146 --> 02:27.730
-Stevie!
-My man!

02:27.814 --> 02:29.607
[both] Unh.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.985
-Deej! My gal!
-Ah. Uh-uh.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.237
Yeah, we're not doing that.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.322
Steve and I have a date,

02:36.406 --> 02:38.575
so can I finish shooting down
your bad idea tomorrow?

02:38.658 --> 02:43.121
Actually, I kinda sorta already booked
our first concierge client.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.957
The mayor of San Francisco.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.208
That is so cool!

02:48.501 --> 02:50.920
What? I'm, like,
a huge fan of city politics.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.132
D.J., a client like this
could really put us on the map,

02:54.215 --> 02:57.260
and she needs our help
with her pet bird tonight.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.428
It's a hornbill.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.221
Horatio Hornbill is sick?

03:02.849 --> 03:04.517
How do you know the bird's name?

03:04.601 --> 03:06.060
I follow him on Twitter.

03:07.478 --> 03:10.982
He said offensive stuff about seagulls,
but he swears he was hacked.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.237
D.J., I really need your help here.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.449
Yeah, but I'm dogs and cats.
You're birds and bunnies.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.994
-You don't need my help.
-I'm afraid of hornbills.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.414
You're afraid of hornbills?

03:26.497 --> 03:28.124
How would you even know that?

03:28.208 --> 03:29.667
It was vet school.

03:29.751 --> 03:33.588
I had to give one an exam,
and he clamped his beak down on my...

03:37.550 --> 03:38.801
my swimsuit region.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.349
That was really brave of you
to share that.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.559
But I kind of wish you hadn't.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.897
Honey, do you mind waiting
so I can go help Matt?

03:50.980 --> 03:51.814
No, of course.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.692
Okay, but I'll be back soon
so we can go on our date night.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.028
Good. Now just go fix that bird.

03:57.111 --> 04:00.240
His last few tweets,
he just... he didn't sound like himself.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.621
Froggy says, "Ribbit."
Froggy says, "Ribbit."

04:07.538 --> 04:08.831
Froggy says, "Ribbit."

04:08.915 --> 04:12.001
Aw. It seems like just yesterday

04:12.085 --> 04:14.671
I was trying to make you laugh
using a frog puppet.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.716
Mom, it was yesterday.

04:21.844 --> 04:24.222
And it was incredibly creepy
to wake up to.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.434
Well, I don't get to
spend time with you anymore.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.478
You're always rushing off with Ethan.

04:31.062 --> 04:34.190
Oh, wow. Now you made this
really awkward, but, um...

04:34.857 --> 04:36.651
I have a date tonight with Ethan.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.822
I got to get ready,  so I'm gonna...

04:40.905 --> 04:42.282
rush off.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.711
Well, hey there, buckaroo.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.924
How was performing at the rootin'-tootin'
boot-scootin' birthday hoedown?

05:01.551 --> 05:02.677
Can I get a yee-haw?

05:04.387 --> 05:06.597
I have zero yee-haws left to give.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.099
Here.

05:08.182 --> 05:11.144
Oh. But now I'm happy.

05:11.853 --> 05:15.356
You know, it's funny. Thought I'd be
so excited to get back to work

05:15.440 --> 05:17.525
and do something
besides changing diapers,

05:17.608 --> 05:20.611
but the whole time I was gone,
I just missed this little one.

05:23.239 --> 05:26.451
And, Kimmy, I need to have
a tough conversation with you,

05:26.534 --> 05:29.996
but you're my boss and my friend,
and I'm not really sure how to do it.

05:30.079 --> 05:33.041
Oh, never fear, Steph.
I can keep the two things separate.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.675
Kimmy your friend is ready to listen.

05:44.802 --> 05:45.803
Spill it, sista.

05:47.138 --> 05:50.683
How does putting a fake paper bow
on your head make you Kimmy my friend?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.685
Tut tut tut.  Just trust the process.

05:55.646 --> 05:56.773
And go.

05:56.856 --> 05:57.857
Okay.

05:58.775 --> 06:03.946
Uh, well... I don't want to sing at
kiddie birthday parties anymore.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.740
Ever since I've become a mom...

06:06.324 --> 06:10.328
any job really has to be worth it
for me to be away from Danielle, you know.

06:10.411 --> 06:11.537
I totally get it.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.665
Motherhood changes all of your priorities.

06:15.708 --> 06:19.921
Oh. I'm so glad to get that off my chest.
Thank you.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.549
So I guess it's time
to talk to Kimmy my boss.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.218
Oh, one moment, please.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.518
[gruff voice]
You wanted to see me, Tanner?

06:35.937 --> 06:38.106
-Well, sir--
-But make it snappy.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.399
It's a madhouse in here.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.947
I would like to respectfully submit
my resignation.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.032
Quitting, are we, Tanner?

06:50.034 --> 06:53.246
Is this because I ate your sandwich
out of the break-room fridge?

06:55.206 --> 06:57.875
It wasn't me. And it wasn't that good.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.462
Well, we'll miss you around here.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.714
Good luck in all of your future endeavors.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.469
[normal tone]
So how'd it go with your boss?

07:13.766 --> 07:16.060
You're never lonely,
even when you're alone, are you?

07:18.688 --> 07:19.856
[doorbell rings]

07:19.939 --> 07:22.066
That's Ethan.
We're going on a date tonight.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.278
Oh. When I open the door,
laugh like I said something funny.

07:25.361 --> 07:26.737
-Nope.
-Not happening.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.992
[laughs]

07:31.075 --> 07:34.203
Oh, my God, I'm so funny. Hi.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.791
Hey, Ethan. I said something funny,

07:38.875 --> 07:41.502
so we were all laughing earlier.
It wasn't just me.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.254
Hi, Ramona.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.674
-Mom, I'm heading out with Ethan.
-Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

07:46.757 --> 07:50.970
Um, um... you've been spending
a lot of time with Ethan,

07:51.053 --> 07:53.097
and I would like to
get to know him better.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.308
And I think you know him
just fine. See ya.

07:55.391 --> 07:59.061
No, you can't go. It's Gibbler Game Night.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.022
What? M-Mom, n-no.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.359
Yay! Did somebody invoke
Gibbler Game Night?

08:10.573 --> 08:11.991
Hello, Mr. Postmates.

08:13.743 --> 08:17.955
I see you have returned
like the patch of dry skin on my elbow.

08:20.791 --> 08:23.794
Are you joining us
for some board-game fun?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.881
-What? No!
-What do you say, Ethan?

08:26.964 --> 08:28.633
He says, "What? No!"

08:31.719 --> 08:32.970
Can I have a word, please?

08:35.723 --> 08:37.058
This just got interesting.

08:38.976 --> 08:41.062
So, what's the big deal
about Gibbler Game Night?

08:41.145 --> 08:43.105
You guys just play board games, right?

08:43.189 --> 08:44.524
Uh,<i> they </i>play.

08:45.149 --> 08:47.777
We settle in
for the spectacle of human drama.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.949
It's like <i>Game of Thrones,</i>
only more cutthroat.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.287
What are you doing, Mom?
I told you I had plans with Ethan.

08:58.371 --> 09:02.166
You can still have plans with Ethan.
Just do it here with us.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.960
[whimpers]

09:06.128 --> 09:07.713
Ethan, run while you still can.

09:09.298 --> 09:12.009
I get it. It's weird
hanging with your parents.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.095
But if this is where you're gonna be...

09:14.804 --> 09:16.389
then this is where I want to be.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.352
[both] Aw...

09:26.691 --> 09:30.945
And this is where the mayor
runs the city of San Francisco.

09:31.028 --> 09:33.990
Now, can I offer you anything?
A refreshment?

09:34.615 --> 09:36.993
A razor for that unseemly stubble?

09:39.662 --> 09:41.163
I think it makes me look rugged.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.458
This is San Francisco, not Seattle.

09:46.544 --> 09:49.422
We're in a bit of a rush. Will you
let the mayor know we're here?

09:50.298 --> 09:51.465
-Boo!
-Oh!

09:51.549 --> 09:53.175
[laughing]

09:53.259 --> 09:56.262
Works every time. I love this chair.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.141
Okay, that just cracks me up.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.810
-Cunningham, introduce me.
-Yes, ma'am.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.687
Doctors Harmon and Fuller,

10:04.770 --> 10:08.566
please meet the Right Honorable
mayor of San Francisco--Eunetta Boone.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.109
Oh.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.111
He's like Siri but more ticklish.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.657
Please don't make me giggle
in front of the guests, ma'am.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.871
It is an honor to meet you, Mayor Boone.
Let's get started.

10:21.954 --> 10:24.540
Madam Mayor, we are here for your bird.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.958
In a minute, Dr. Doolittle.

10:27.627 --> 10:31.047
First, get over here.
I know you want a selfie with the mayor.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.381
Everyone does.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.383
[shutter snaps]

10:34.467 --> 10:38.346
Now when you post it,
caption it, "I mayor so hard."

10:41.891 --> 10:44.101
This is Horatio Hornbill.

10:44.185 --> 10:48.856
He was a gift from San Francisco's
sister city, Manila, in the Philippines.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.816
In exchange, we sent them Metallica.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.695
The mayor would like you
to clip his wings.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.990
If he flies away,
it could cause an international incident.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.576
Or worse. They might send back Metallica.

11:02.536 --> 11:05.706
Well, I can clip his wings
in five minutes.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.376
Totally worth a house call
in the middle of my date.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.962
We will not let you down, Mayor.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.589
Now, if you will excuse the mayor,

11:13.673 --> 11:17.510
she has a ribbon-cutting ceremony
for a new opening of Panera Bread.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.762
[chuckles]

11:19.845 --> 11:21.222
Between you and me...

11:22.807 --> 11:26.227
these giant scissors
are the reason I ran for mayor.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.483
[D.J.] Okay, let's get started.

11:32.566 --> 11:36.821
D.J., wait. Do not get too close
to that beast

11:36.904 --> 11:39.990
until I have my tranquilizer gun ready.

11:40.074 --> 11:43.494
Wha... You brought a tranq gun
for a Fruit Loops bird?

11:44.745 --> 11:47.707
Last time I saw the Fruit Loops bird,
he bit my Apple Jacks.

11:57.717 --> 12:01.095
I'm sorry, Ethan. This is gonna get
real weird, real quick.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.473
Hey, do you guys know where your mom--

12:04.557 --> 12:08.561
Shh. The delicious drama
of human humiliation is about to begin.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.021
What's going on?

12:11.105 --> 12:13.149
-Gibbler Game Night.
-You didn't see me.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.112
Mom, plug your ears.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.366
Okay, Papa. Your clue is <i>Top Gun.</i>

12:22.450 --> 12:25.745
[gasps] "I feel the need,
the need for speed."

12:27.204 --> 12:29.790
I am merging onto the highway
to the danger zone!

12:31.292 --> 12:32.293
And go.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.296
Oh,  I know this. Um...

12:35.379 --> 12:37.089
uh... a straight line.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.341
A... squiggly line?

12:41.051 --> 12:43.512
-Something coming out of a straight line.
-Time.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.016
It was <i>Top Gun!</i>

12:47.850 --> 12:52.188
Ooh-ooh. You have insulted me,
Maverick, and the Goose.

12:55.191 --> 12:58.277
Now I have to go play
some shirtless volleyball to cool off.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.238
And watch <i>Top Gun </i>for the first time.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.993
Wow, so I guess game night is over.
Should we just go?

13:06.076 --> 13:09.538
Oh, newbie, I wish it were that easy.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.084
Three... two... one.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.378
Kimberlina?

13:18.964 --> 13:19.965
Please.

13:20.966 --> 13:21.967
Forgive me?

13:24.345 --> 13:25.971
I'm not worthy of your affections.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.224
I promise I will never
lose my temper again.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.312
I sentence you
to five minutes of Eskimo kisses.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.865
Hey, Dani.
You're never gonna believe this,

13:44.949 --> 13:48.744
but your mom
was an international party DJ. Yeah.

13:49.537 --> 13:52.373
Closest I get to spinning now
is when I operate the dryer.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.670
But I'm gonna figure out
my next career move.

13:57.753 --> 14:00.047
I hope. Maybe.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.634
If you have any ideas,
now's the time to share them.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.594
-[footsteps approach]
-Hey, Steph.

14:06.428 --> 14:07.429
Hey.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.349
What's with the tool belt,
Bob the Builder?

14:11.350 --> 14:14.186
I'm just waiting for D.J.
to finish up with the mayor's hornbill.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.856
Is that a sequel to <i>The Handmaid's Tale?</i>

14:17.690 --> 14:20.776
No, no. She and Matt are working,
and I'm just keeping busy.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.862
I just tightened up
all the knobs in the kitchen,

14:22.945 --> 14:25.990
and now I'm changing all the batteries
in the smoke detectors.

14:26.740 --> 14:29.660
Wow. Another episode
of <i>Podiatrists Gone Wild.</i>

14:32.705 --> 14:36.959
The truth is, I'll do anything to avoid
getting sucked into Gibbler Game Night.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.797
Gotcha. I have a newborn, and there's
less screaming and crying down here.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.424
[Steve chuckles]

14:43.507 --> 14:46.176
So what's going on? And where's
the carbon monoxide detector?

14:46.260 --> 14:48.888
Because I got a pocketful of batteries
and an hour to kill.

14:50.389 --> 14:54.476
I'm just... thinking how I'm kind of at
a career crossroads now that I'm a mom.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.021
Funny.

14:57.104 --> 15:00.482
The only job I never thought I'd have
is the one that makes me the happiest...

15:00.566 --> 15:03.694
-Hmm.
-...but... I got to find something.

15:03.777 --> 15:07.072
You had a great career as a DJ.
You've led a super-awesome fun life.

15:07.156 --> 15:11.619
Doesn't have to end 'cause you're a mom.
I mean, maybe the, uh, private jets

15:11.702 --> 15:14.747
and playing all-night raves
in Ibiza with Prince Harry.

15:14.830 --> 15:18.959
I was never in Ibiza with Prince Harry.
You know what? I was with Prince Harry.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.590
You could still be a great mom to Danielle
and, uh, be artistically fulfilled.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.885
Whoa. Maybe we do need to check
the carbon monoxide,

15:27.968 --> 15:29.303
'cause you're making sense.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.348
Look, you just got to figure out
what you love,

15:32.431 --> 15:35.601
and give it that Stephanie Tanner hustle
till you're doing it.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.062
Thanks, Steve.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.981
By the way, I fixed your bidet.

15:43.150 --> 15:44.276
We don't have a bidet.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.072
Then I seriously messed up your toilet.

15:53.744 --> 15:54.745
Hmm.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.290
Figure out what I love and do that.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.585
The only thing I really want to do
is watch you smile.

All done. Not sure if you can tell

If he tries to fly, he's gonna fall.

We've got to coax him in.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.633
Mama's got a date tonight,
and I don't have time to bury a bird.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.490
Are you okay?

17:55.282 --> 17:56.992
That's a lot of tranquilizer.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.537
Yeah. I'm fine, Mom.

18:03.373 --> 18:05.292
Hey, are you making spaghetti tonight?

18:05.876 --> 18:09.797
Okay. I, uh, I think

18:37.199 --> 18:39.785
you're in big trouble
in the game of Trouble.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.539
It's a good thing we're not playing Clue,

18:43.622 --> 18:46.834

in your library.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.377
Ooh.

18:48.460 --> 18:52.339
There's so much tension between them.
They're still married?

18:52.422 --> 18:56.093
Actually, they're divorced, but then
they got reengaged with a falcon.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.013
Then they had a wedding
where they agreed not to be married,

19:00.097 --> 19:01.723
conducted by men on Rollerblades.

19:03.642 --> 19:04.977
Tell me about your family.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.648
Aha! It's a four!

19:09.731 --> 19:12.568
Ooh, this is an outrage.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.862
I knew I'd be sorry
we didn't play Sorry.

Well, I... I just took your advice
and did what I love.

21:34.251 --> 21:37.587
I always loved writing music
that means something to me.

21:37.671 --> 21:38.964

I had to give up once I became a mom.

is exactly what you needed
to make this dream come true.

21:51.643 --> 21:52.978

I'm already 50 grand in debt,
and I didn't even finish college.

22:39.107 --> 22:43.236
I did. Perhaps your triplets
can clean the pool at my beach house.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.783

at my country club.

Yes. I Gibblered all over the place.

I'm really glad I stayed.

Honestly, you guys are a great couple.

before you realized your true feelings.

26:19.619 --> 26:20.745
Wow.

Those tranquilizers came with
an extra dose of honesty.

But in the end, it all worked out.

26:29.546 --> 26:30.839
We both got lucky.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.549
We did, didn't we?

26:32.632 --> 26:34.759
So when are you and Steve getting married?

26:35.969 --> 26:39.347
Well, I've been thinking about it
more than I ever have and...

26:40.056 --> 26:42.559
well, now I'm talking about
thinking about it, and...

26:43.310 --> 26:44.936
I think I like the sound of it.

26:46.479 --> 26:48.231
I want to marry Steve.

26:48.315 --> 26:49.274

26:49.357 --> 26:51.776
Dr. Steven Hale has arrived.

26:52.819 --> 26:55.822
Oh, Steve. Thank goodness.
I am so glad to see you.

26:55.905 --> 26:57.741
Stevie! Chest bump!

This is amazing.
How did you do all of this?

27:10.378 --> 27:12.088
[sighs] We missed our reservation,

27:12.172 --> 27:14.633
but I still wanted to give you
a special evening.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.718
And you'd be surprised
what a man can achieve

27:16.801 --> 27:19.137
when he's trying to avoid
Gibbler Game Night.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.556
Oh, I missed Gibbler Game Night?

27:22.223 --> 27:25.060
Yeah, maybe being a concierge vet
isn't so bad after all.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.396
Sorry you had to work.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.648
Oh, it's okay.

27:33.526 --> 27:36.529
You know, I realized something
about us tonight.

27:36.613 --> 27:37.822
Oh, yeah? What's that?

Oh, good. You guys are home.

27:42.327 --> 27:45.497
We need two more for Twister.
Fair warning, Fernando is shirtless.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.420
Yeah, we'll be right in.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.884
