00:15.932 --> 00:16.850
Thanks.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.352
Hello, Alta.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.646
-Hello, ma'am. How was the trip?
-Great, thanks.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.774
I've been calling, but no one answers.
Where are they?

00:24.858 --> 00:28.570
Rodrigo isn't home.
He went out with Ms. Paloma.

00:28.653 --> 00:29.487
Who is Paloma?

00:29.571 --> 00:31.698
His girlfriend, ma'am.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.366
His girlfriend?

00:34.576 --> 00:36.453
Since when does he have a girlfriend?

00:36.536 --> 00:38.913
So many things happened
while you were gone.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.290
After all, it's been a week.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.585
Ceci isn't eating.
She says she's depressed.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.378
I hope it's not that bulimia thing.

00:46.337 --> 00:49.174
-And my husband?
-Oh, he's the worst.

00:49.257 --> 00:51.301
-Why?
-He's growing a mustache.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.437
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:02.288 --> 02:03.623
What's wrong, sweetie?

02:04.415 --> 02:06.835
-You aren't eating. Are you ill?
-I'm not hungry.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.378
I bet she's on her period.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.213
-Ro.
-What?

02:10.296 --> 02:11.673
It happens to Paloma.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.883
Tell me all about this girl, Paloma.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.678
It's no big deal. We're hanging out.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.847
-We have a date on Saturday.
-This Saturday?

02:18.930 --> 02:21.724
But I haven't seen you all week.
No, Ro. No.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.811
I was thinking
we should all go to Valle de Bravo.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.147
I want to have some family time.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.566
Besides, I want to catch up with everyone.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.401
Dad already said yes.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.904
I have a golf tournament all weekend.
I can't go to Valle.

02:35.905 --> 02:36.906
And I'd rather not go.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.533
I want to be alone.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.702
Hey, what's wrong with you?

02:41.202 --> 02:43.830
Ana just spent a week away,
she wants some time with you.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.458
I'd do anything to spend 
some time like that with my family.

02:48.042 --> 02:50.879
I barely got my parents
to speak to each other.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.590
A weekend in Valle sounds great.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.383
Yeah, right. Great.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.886
We've been going for years, it's boring.

02:57.969 --> 03:01.764
Come on! Be grateful
for what your parents can give you.

03:02.515 --> 03:06.394
When I was a kid, I would've killed 
to have a house outside the city.

03:06.895 --> 03:10.815
I can't even remember
the last time I went on a family trip.

03:11.399 --> 03:14.110
Ro, tell Paloma you'll have
your date some other day.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.614
And you, Ceci,
could use a change of scenery.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.992
I guess I can ask Víctor
to cover me at the tournament.

03:21.075 --> 03:22.994
And I can reschedule with Paloma.

03:23.703 --> 03:26.623
-Well, all right. We're going.
-Yes!

03:26.706 --> 03:28.958
I suppose you're coming too, right?

03:29.042 --> 03:31.085
-I didn't know I was invited.
-Of course!

03:31.169 --> 03:34.756
But I told Pablo we would work
on our app this weekend.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.008
Bring him along.
He's part of the family too.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.053
Are you okay?

03:40.970 --> 03:43.765
You know what? Tell your mom to come too.

03:44.891 --> 03:45.975
Are you okay?

03:48.311 --> 03:51.731
Actually, if you want Elena to come,
go ahead and invite her.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.816
I'm assuming you're okay, right?

03:55.109 --> 03:58.488
What's in the juice, Alta?
Everyone's choking.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.406
Nothing, ma'am.

04:01.866 --> 04:05.286
Well, I already organized some activities
we can all do together.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.915
Sounds great! I know some amazing games.

04:08.998 --> 04:12.961
When I was a kid, my mom sent me
to the YMCA camp at Camohmila.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.714
I already have my ideas.

04:17.215 --> 04:21.135
But if there's time to spare,
we could do some of yours too.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.054
It's set then. We're going to Valle.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.975
To Valle de Bravo.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.643
Mom, please, say something.

04:29.477 --> 04:30.812
What can I say?

04:31.729 --> 04:34.899
Sometimes life plays cruel tricks on us.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.568
There are so many married men out there

04:37.652 --> 04:40.238
and you had to sleep
with your granddaughter's dad.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.824
No, but her granddaughter came later.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.534
-Mom, please.
-What?

04:47.161 --> 04:48.288
What am I going to do?

04:48.371 --> 04:51.916
Can you imagine? Me and Juan Carlos 
spending a whole weekend together?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.877
Tere, but you can't push your family away

04:54.961 --> 04:57.964
out of fear of being near to Juan Carlos.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.383
Unless you still want him.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.843
No! Of course not.

05:06.347 --> 05:07.890
What if I take Anuar?

05:07.974 --> 05:09.642
-A…?
-Yeah!

05:09.726 --> 05:13.062
Yes, I mean,
after all, he's Mariana's dad.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.440
And Ana wants the whole family to go.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.568
That will help me
keep my distance with Juan Carlos.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.653
And what will Mariana think…

05:21.988 --> 05:22.905
if you go together?

05:22.989 --> 05:25.658
Oh, I don't know, Mom. 
I'd rather have her thinking

05:25.742 --> 05:27.618
I'm fixing my issues with Anuar

05:27.702 --> 05:29.746
than her finding out about Juan Carlos.

05:31.622 --> 05:32.582
You'll like this.

05:32.665 --> 05:37.170
"With Konene, taking care of your baby
is easier than keeping a plant alive."

05:39.964 --> 05:41.966
That's the slogan for the app?

05:42.967 --> 05:44.844
Yes, why? It'll sell, right?

05:45.553 --> 05:48.014
Dude, you're comparing Regina to a plant.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.436
Okay, what do you propose?

05:54.437 --> 05:56.022
Because we need to start selling.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.482
The beta version is running.

05:57.565 --> 06:00.401
Yes, but we can't launch it
with the current design.

06:00.485 --> 06:03.863
We used the gallery template
to test it out, and it's no good.

06:04.572 --> 06:05.406
What do you want?

06:05.907 --> 06:09.994
-A designer will charge us a ton.
-I got a quote. Here, I'll show you.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.873
Let's see.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.584
There it is.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.213
That much?

06:20.296 --> 06:23.633
Yeah, but we only have to pay half
to get started.

06:23.716 --> 06:27.136
It's important for the app to have
its own visual identity from the start,

06:27.220 --> 06:28.763
to attract more users.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.141
Okay, but where
are we going to get the money?

06:32.225 --> 06:35.853
I don't know. I've no idea.
We'll have to come up with something.

06:36.437 --> 06:37.522
But trust me.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.316
If we want Konene to work,
we have to invest in it.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.903
-Konene will be a fucking hit.
-Hell yeah!

06:46.697 --> 06:49.742
There are a bunch of games
we can play in the pool at Valle.

06:50.618 --> 06:53.121
I thought you wanted
to spend time with our family.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.956
Well, Mariana is part of our family.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.374
I know.

06:56.874 --> 06:59.001
But why do Pablo and Teresa have to come?

06:59.502 --> 07:03.214
Because they're Mariana's family.
And Regina's too.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.091
Honey,

07:05.174 --> 07:07.802
it's been a while
since we've spent time together.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.305
You should've thought of that
before taking the promotion.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.232
Did you really name it Konene?

07:21.774 --> 07:23.276
Dude, what's wrong with it?

07:23.359 --> 07:26.154
It means "nanny" in Náhuatl, it's awesome.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.114
Since when do you speak Náhuatl?

07:29.657 --> 07:32.076
Pablo wanted to launch it as is,

07:32.160 --> 07:35.246
but I was firm
about having a way cooler design.

07:35.329 --> 07:38.458
Now, the issue
is getting money to pay for the designer.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.752
Convince Pablo to sell a kidney.

07:41.836 --> 07:42.753
Or two?

07:43.629 --> 07:46.257
If you won't borrow money from me,
make me a partner.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.760
"Pablo doesn't like you." I know.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.846
It's not that. Really.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.724
So? You need money,

07:54.807 --> 07:56.934
I have some savings, 
and I want to invest them.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.313
What do you think? Business is business.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.027
Welcome to Konene, partner.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.863
See you in Valle, partner.

08:10.531 --> 08:11.782
What's going on?

08:12.450 --> 08:13.951
We're all ready.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.620
I'm not going.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.288
What's wrong?

08:20.374 --> 08:21.250
I just…

08:21.876 --> 08:23.336
feel like a fool.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.715
This guy made me believe he was into me.

08:28.382 --> 08:30.927
But after we kissed,
he said he didn't like me.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.513
And it turns out
this guy is coming to Valle too.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.183
-The last thing I want is to see him.
-Oh, Ceci.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.144
But staying here all alone won't help.

08:40.686 --> 08:44.315
Really, being with your family
will make you feel better, trust me.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.817
Come on, pack your bags.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.737
-We're all ready downstairs.
-Mariana.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.366
Don't tell anyone I told you, okay?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.952
-Okay.
-Thanks.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.662
Hurry!

08:59.789 --> 09:01.707
-Aren't you going to tell me?
-What?

09:02.250 --> 09:03.668
Where did you get the money?

09:03.751 --> 09:05.002
Who cares, Pablo?

09:05.503 --> 09:09.549
What matters is we have the designer
we wanted for our app, right?

09:10.174 --> 09:12.343
Yes, Mariana,
but where did the money come from?

09:12.426 --> 09:14.053
Who cares, Pablo?

09:15.805 --> 09:16.931
It was Elena, wasn't it?

09:17.014 --> 09:18.766
Yes, because she's my friend.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.518
Then we must pay her back ASAP.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.645
We don't have to pay her ASAP.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.063
Why not?

09:25.481 --> 09:27.900
Will you be paying her with sex, or what?

09:28.859 --> 09:31.737
No, because she'll be our partner.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.365
No way, Mariana.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.284
Why didn't you ask me?

09:36.367 --> 09:38.619
Because we need the money, dude.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.122
Do you want Konene to launch or not?

09:51.966 --> 09:53.634
Home sweet home!

09:57.221 --> 10:00.808
Okay, the room upstairs
is Juan Carlos's and mine,

10:00.891 --> 10:03.519
Pablo will sleep with Rodrigo in his room.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.938
And next door, Mariana and Elena.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.148
All right?

10:07.231 --> 10:08.149
-Yes.
-Okay?

10:08.232 --> 10:10.860
Yes, thanks. Is there a crib for Regina?

10:10.943 --> 10:12.778
No, she'll sleep in the nursery.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.904
Okay, perfect.

10:13.988 --> 10:14.864
Hello!

10:14.947 --> 10:16.073
How's it going?

10:16.157 --> 10:17.908
Hello, family!

10:20.703 --> 10:22.538
You must be Juan Carlos, right?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.123
How are you? I'm Anuar.

10:24.206 --> 10:26.584
Nice to meet you. I'm Mariana's dad.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.377
-Hello.
-We hadn't met before.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.963
Hello, hello. Anuar.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.090
-How are you? Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.427
-Hello.
-Sweetie, how are you? Hi, baby!

10:36.510 --> 10:39.597
I'm so sorry,
but there's no other spare room.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.808
Oh, don't be. Don't worry.
We'll sleep together. Yes.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.394
-No problem.
-Are you sure?

10:45.895 --> 10:47.271
Of course, no worries.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.523
Well then, we're all set.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.317
Welcome.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.902
I'll take you to your rooms.

10:52.985 --> 10:53.819
-This way.
-Thanks.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.529
-Follow me.
-Go ahead.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.245
One button…

11:04.246 --> 11:06.666
-Two buttons…
-I was terrible at that.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.335
Oh, you startled me, Anuar.

11:09.418 --> 11:12.129
When I changed you,
either I put things on backwards

11:12.213 --> 11:14.215
or they fell, or something happened.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.175
But…

11:16.801 --> 11:19.136
this little girl…

11:20.179 --> 11:24.266
won't lose her diaper. Right, baby?

11:25.476 --> 11:26.686
Oh, so pretty.

11:30.106 --> 11:30.940
Hey.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.068
I'm really happy you came.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.947
Frankly, I didn't expect
you and my mom to come together.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.033
-Well, you know--
-Mariana.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.618
Mariana!

11:42.702 --> 11:44.954
Let's go, or Ana will have a fit.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.872
Come here, darling.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.208
Let's go.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.001
Let's go, baby, let's go.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.420
What? Where's your swimsuit?

11:53.129 --> 11:55.923
We have to seize the sun
and get the girls in the pool.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.717
It's kind of cold, isn't it?

11:57.800 --> 12:00.761
-Cold?
-Cold? Are you cold?

12:01.554 --> 12:03.597
-No.
-Yes, a bit. Yes.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.349
-Yes.
-That's weird.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.436
Maybe it's because
you two never leave the city.

12:08.519 --> 12:09.603
I'm not cold.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.689
Let's play something instead.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.275
How about charades?

12:14.358 --> 12:16.360
I'm great at charades.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.404
-Right, we can tell.
-Okay.

12:19.488 --> 12:22.408
-Should we choose teams?
-Yeah.

12:22.491 --> 12:23.701
But…

12:23.784 --> 12:26.579
I don't want to be
on Rodrigo's team, he cheats.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.290
Hey, but… Well,

12:29.874 --> 12:33.335
tomorrow
we'll get up early to swim, all right?

12:33.419 --> 12:35.254
-Yeah.
-Sure.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.965
What is that?

12:38.048 --> 12:39.300
The old man from Up.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.638
Oh, Anabelle!

12:44.722 --> 12:45.556
No!

12:46.348 --> 12:48.309
I know! Psycho.

12:48.392 --> 12:49.226
Exactly!

12:50.311 --> 12:51.228
Oh, no!

12:51.312 --> 12:52.438
Good one, team!

12:52.521 --> 12:53.773
Good job, team!

12:53.856 --> 12:54.732
Oh, no.

12:54.815 --> 12:55.858
Good one.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.652
Ceci, perk up, they're winning. Go.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.489
-Come on, Ceci!
-Come on! Attitude!

13:01.572 --> 13:02.656
Come on, team.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.034
-Come on!
-You can't catch up to us.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.827
-Go on.
-Your time starts now!

13:09.955 --> 13:10.956
Someone making tacos.

13:12.875 --> 13:13.751
What is she doing?

13:13.834 --> 13:16.462
No. I know! Kung Fu Panda.

13:16.545 --> 13:17.838
-No.
-No.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.675
Oh, I know! Edward Scissorhands.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.552
-Mom.
-What?

13:23.636 --> 13:26.138
-It's Memories of a Geisha.
-Kill Bill.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.057
-The time ran out.
-Time's up.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.266
-Yes?
-No.

13:29.767 --> 13:30.643
Yes?

13:30.726 --> 13:32.645
-Come on, Ceci!
-Time's up.

13:32.728 --> 13:35.981
-What are you doing?
-Your time's up.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.900
Ceci, what are you doing?

13:37.983 --> 13:39.401
Well, it was Karate Kid.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.239
You should've done,
"Wax on, wax off." That was easier.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.156
Okay, enough.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.867
Let's stop here and call it a tie.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.077
Yeah, right.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.955
Mom, it can't be a tie,
you didn't guess any.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.540
It's not about winning, sweetie.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.125
No, it's about not losing, and you lost.

13:55.209 --> 13:58.838
Hey, your mom is right.
Enough charades for today. Let's go.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.758
Yes, I'm still tired from the road.
I want to lay down for a bit.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.302
Everyone in bathing suits tomorrow, okay?

14:12.476 --> 14:15.521
You put the whole bottle
of perfume on. Yuck!

14:16.272 --> 14:17.481
What are you doing?

14:18.858 --> 14:21.861
You've been paving the way
to this moment, haven't you?

14:21.944 --> 14:22.820
What? No.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.114
You misinterpreted.

14:27.616 --> 14:31.412
You said we could sleep together
and you put your hand on my leg.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.247
On your knee.

14:34.039 --> 14:34.957
As friends.

14:43.048 --> 14:46.594
You know what? Why don't you
put some clothes on, instead?

14:47.428 --> 14:49.138
And I'll go get a glass of water.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.601
Dude, men are scumbags.

14:53.684 --> 14:56.145
I hate them. They're all idiots.

14:56.228 --> 14:59.773
They think with their dicks
rather than their head, honestly.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.191
I'll go pee.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.570
How's Tinder going for you?

15:05.070 --> 15:06.447
Oh, awful. Awful.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.866
-I even deleted it from my phone.
-Why?

15:09.617 --> 15:13.370
I don't know.
I felt uncomfortable with my body.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.248
I realized
I can't just do it with any stranger.

15:16.332 --> 15:21.211
I'd rather do it
with someone I trust, you know?

15:22.171 --> 15:23.797
Like Elena, for example?

15:26.300 --> 15:28.135
Ceci, don't tell anyone, but…

15:29.303 --> 15:31.639
I ended up having sex with Pablo, dude.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.933
It was intense.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.019
It's a surprise.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.771
I brought a Château Mondain.

15:39.563 --> 15:40.481
Our favorite.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.983
No, thanks. I'm not in the mood.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.862
Juan Carlos,
I'm really making an effort here

15:46.946 --> 15:48.489
to spend quality time together.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.325
I'm glad, Ana. It's great.

15:52.076 --> 15:55.579
But don't expect time
to go as you planned.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.623
It's hard for me
to have a positive attitude

15:57.706 --> 15:59.291
when you leave for so long.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.627
But I was only gone for a week.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.088
You're acting as if I'd left for a year.

16:04.171 --> 16:07.508
You even grew out a mustache.
You know I hate it.

16:07.591 --> 16:11.011
It's not about your week away.
It's about what's coming ahead.

16:11.887 --> 16:15.432
Ana, I want a partner that's present,
not some helicopter

16:15.516 --> 16:19.520
that comes and goes,
and expects us to be at her beck and call.

16:21.605 --> 16:22.731
And I love it.

16:23.983 --> 16:24.817
The mustache.

16:37.162 --> 16:37.997
Tere.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.842
You're back with Anuar.

16:50.718 --> 16:54.263
We are trying to become a couple again.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.222
Yes.

16:57.766 --> 16:59.435
I like that mustache on you.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.359
Can you imagine what
we could've been in other circumstances?

17:07.443 --> 17:08.277
No.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.821
Are you crazy? Someone could see us.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.281
No "what ifs."

17:13.407 --> 17:15.409
It's time to get back to our reality.

17:37.056 --> 17:37.931
Hey!

17:38.849 --> 17:39.725
Where's Ceci?

17:43.562 --> 17:45.397
She must be in the bathroom.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.066
No, her stuff is gone.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.248
Voice mail. Your call can't be…

18:05.793 --> 18:07.836
Come on. Let's go!

18:18.138 --> 18:19.264
And your glass of water?

18:20.432 --> 18:21.934
Well, I drank it already.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.852
Don't tell me you wanted one.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.563
Can you tell me
about you and Juan Carlos?

18:28.482 --> 18:29.650
What do you mean?

18:30.150 --> 18:32.402
Don't play dumb. I saw you on the terrace.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.117
Thank you.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.201
Ceci!

18:40.077 --> 18:42.079
Dude, maybe she went to grab a bite.

18:42.579 --> 18:47.167
No. She said some guy that kissed her
and dumped her would be here in Valle.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.086
Maybe she ran into him.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.671
Oh, okay. Shit.

18:50.754 --> 18:51.922
Go to the house.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.842
Maybe she's there,
I'll stay here and look for her.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.636
-Call me if you find her.
-Okay. Thanks.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.681
Ceci!

19:01.849 --> 19:02.766
Ceci!

19:06.186 --> 19:10.566
Voice mail. Your call can't be processed.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.694
So, that's why you brought me?
To make Juan Carlos jealous.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.154
No, just the opposite!

19:15.654 --> 19:18.448
It's just… I didn't know what to do.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.742
I told you because I trust you.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.744
No, you told me
because I caught you, Tere.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.413
Oh, Anuar.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.999
Sorry. I screwed up again. I'm sorry.

19:28.792 --> 19:31.753
I met him way before Regina was born and…

19:32.963 --> 19:35.340
How was I to know
all of this would happen?

19:35.424 --> 19:36.550
-Look.
-It's okay.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.595
Calm down, okay. Calm down.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.973
All I want
is to make it clear to Juan Carlos

19:43.056 --> 19:44.850
that we can never be together again.

19:47.102 --> 19:48.061
Can you help me?

19:49.229 --> 19:50.564
We'll play your game.

19:51.148 --> 19:51.982
Thank you.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.321
Back so soon?

19:58.405 --> 20:00.574
I thought Elena liked staying out late.

20:00.657 --> 20:02.492
No. Hey, have you seen Ceci?

20:03.869 --> 20:04.703
What?

20:05.454 --> 20:06.622
Wasn't she with you?

20:19.259 --> 20:20.427
Ceci.

20:21.511 --> 20:22.679
Elena.

20:23.639 --> 20:24.723
Thank you.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.516
Oh, my God!

20:27.184 --> 20:28.810
You're wasted.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.314
What happened? Why did you leave?

20:33.023 --> 20:35.192
It's that guy that kissed you, right?

20:35.275 --> 20:36.652
Did you see him at the bar?

20:36.735 --> 20:39.112
Want to know who it was?

20:40.739 --> 20:42.115
Come on, let's go, okay?

20:42.699 --> 20:43.533
It was Pablo.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.247
Which Pablo?

20:48.330 --> 20:49.414
Why didn't you call me?

20:49.498 --> 20:52.209
She was sad.
Some guy ditched her. We went to a bar…

20:52.292 --> 20:53.418
You took her to a bar?

20:53.919 --> 20:56.129
She's a minor. How could you?

20:56.213 --> 20:57.631
Juan Carlos, we're in Valle.

20:57.714 --> 21:00.676
Apparently, the drinking age here is 14.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.137
That's not the point.

21:04.221 --> 21:07.266
What matters is we find her
before she does something stupid.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.732
Olivia, how are you?
This is Juan Carlos, Ceci's father.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.110
We can't find Cecilia.

21:18.735 --> 21:21.947
No, I just need you to tell me one thing.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.117
Who's the brat that broke
my daughter's heart?

21:25.617 --> 21:27.828
No, Olivia, I need a name.

21:30.956 --> 21:31.999
Pablo who?

21:35.419 --> 21:36.545
You kissed my daughter?

21:37.337 --> 21:38.505
No.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.800
-Well, yes, but she kissed me…
-You son of a…

21:42.301 --> 21:44.511
-Wait, Juan Carlos.
-What's wrong with you?

21:45.095 --> 21:48.015
I open my house to you.
You hang out with my family,

21:48.098 --> 21:50.726
-and this is how you repay me?
-Wait, Juan Carlos.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.894
This must be a misunderstanding.
Right, Pablo?

21:52.978 --> 21:55.230
Yes, I think Ceci got me wrong.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.648
Did you kiss Ceci or not?

21:59.776 --> 22:00.777
Well…

22:07.951 --> 22:09.077
What happened to her?

22:09.578 --> 22:10.662
What do you think?

22:11.538 --> 22:12.748
You're an asshole.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.751
Ceci, tell them the truth
about what happened.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.336
The truth is…

22:18.587 --> 22:20.339
we kissed.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.424
No, it wasn't like that. No.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.259
Fucking men!

22:24.801 --> 22:25.635
Not you, Dad.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.722
You're very lucky your mom didn't wake up.

22:29.973 --> 22:33.477
And I want you out of this house
first thing in the morning.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.981
Let me explain. Ceci kissed me.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.733
Good night, Pablo.

22:48.575 --> 22:49.868
Fuck.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.481
Why did you sleep on the couch?

23:20.941 --> 23:23.360
-What time is it?
-Time for breakfast.

23:23.902 --> 23:27.447
Anuar is making some… omelets.

23:40.168 --> 23:41.002
Ceci.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.340
How are you? Are you okay?

23:46.216 --> 23:48.009
My dad is making omelets.

23:50.720 --> 23:51.805
Hey…

23:52.389 --> 23:54.349
can we talk
about what happened with Pablo?

23:54.433 --> 23:55.976
Why didn't you tell me?

23:56.059 --> 23:58.562
How could I tell you
he was flirting with me?

23:58.645 --> 24:01.565
Well, Pablo says you kissed him.

24:01.648 --> 24:04.985
Well, he was sending me
all kinds of signals.

24:05.068 --> 24:06.445
What kind of signals?

24:09.114 --> 24:10.031
Look, Ceci,

24:10.115 --> 24:14.327
the whole signal thing
can be a bit complicated.

24:14.411 --> 24:18.457
Sometimes, when we like someone,
we see what we want to see.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.168
Maybe I did get it wrong.

24:21.251 --> 24:24.921
You can't kiss someone if you're not sure
that person wants it too.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.673
You have to ask for permission.

24:26.756 --> 24:29.801
And I know this sounds
like the least romantic thing ever,

24:29.885 --> 24:32.554
but it's like the #MeToo for beginners.

24:32.637 --> 24:33.972
Yes, you're right.

24:35.849 --> 24:36.808
My dad.

24:36.892 --> 24:39.311
He can't find out. He'll kill him.

24:39.394 --> 24:40.979
Wow, you blacked out, Ceci.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.064
You told us all last night.

24:43.732 --> 24:44.566
No.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.487
Cecilia, get up. Hurry.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.079
Eat chilaquiles for your hangover.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.165
My dad is making omelets.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.336
Get up!

25:04.836 --> 25:05.712
Hey,

25:06.463 --> 25:08.423
he hasn't killed Pablo yet.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.425
But really, you need to talk to him.

25:10.926 --> 25:11.801
Okay?

25:15.472 --> 25:17.307
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.184
Anuar is making omelets.

25:21.019 --> 25:22.103
Ana's allergic to eggs.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.272
Good morning.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.732
-Good morning.
-Hello.

25:26.858 --> 25:27.692
That's it.

25:27.776 --> 25:31.071
-Hello, what's going on?
-Hello. I'm not staying.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.950
I have some work to do in the city
and need to get back.

25:35.033 --> 25:38.245
No, that's nonsense, Pablito.
You can't miss my omelet.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.580
Or the activities I prepared for today.

25:40.664 --> 25:43.792
Ana, he's probably got things to do.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.544
He needs to go, let him go.

25:45.627 --> 25:46.461
Oh, please,

25:47.003 --> 25:49.506
if I can miss work for a weekend…

25:50.006 --> 25:52.717
Yes, I want to play on Anuar's team.

25:55.887 --> 25:58.306
-Mom?
-Hello, good morning.

26:00.308 --> 26:02.143
What's wrong?

26:02.894 --> 26:04.312
Must be something I ate.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.774
Nothing a swim can't cure, right?

26:09.067 --> 26:12.028
But we should wait a while after eating.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.614
Sure, we don't want anyone drowning.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.116
No one's drowning, Tere.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.617
We are so lucky.

26:17.701 --> 26:19.786
Anuar's not only a chef but a lifeguard.

26:21.580 --> 26:22.706
Let's go outside.

26:22.789 --> 26:25.500
I prepared an activity
I'm sure you'll all love.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.335
-Are you ready? Let's go.
-Yes.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.295
No, but…

26:28.795 --> 26:31.047
I asked you to please
put your swimsuits on.

26:31.131 --> 26:33.675
-I'm with Ceci.
-But what about swimming?

26:33.758 --> 26:35.927
-I'm with Anuar.
-Hey, but…

26:37.345 --> 26:39.347
The point is to have fun,

26:39.431 --> 26:42.559
and the first team to make it
to the finish line wins, okay?

26:42.642 --> 26:43.977
And what's the prize?

26:44.060 --> 26:45.979
Choosing the next activity.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.189
Okay. You're on.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.734
Let's put the ropes on.

26:51.776 --> 26:54.529
We have to coordinate, okay?
And go at the same pace.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.364
One, two, one, two. Okay?

26:59.576 --> 27:02.370
Hey, Ceci told me everything.

27:02.954 --> 27:04.539
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

27:05.540 --> 27:09.419
Your problem is you never trust me…
not even to tell me about Elena.

27:09.502 --> 27:12.380
You must understand
it hasn't been easy for me to trust again.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.508
I mean, you've been great,
and you're a great person,

27:15.592 --> 27:18.136
but I don't know
if you'll be the same tomorrow.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.388
You're being unfair.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.265
What more can I do?

27:22.349 --> 27:24.893
You left me
at the most vulnerable point of my life.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.812
Shall we start?
Or do you need some coffee and snacks?

27:28.313 --> 27:30.565
-No, we're ready. Sorry.
-Ready.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.485
On your marks, get set…

27:34.319 --> 27:35.153
Go!

27:38.031 --> 27:39.783
I said coordinated, Juan Carlos.

27:39.866 --> 27:41.743
-That's what I'm doing.
-One and two.

27:43.036 --> 27:45.080
-I felt vulnerable too.
-What?

27:45.163 --> 27:47.916
When you got pregnant.
I didn't know if I wanted to be a dad.

27:48.541 --> 27:49.918
Pablo, you're shitting me.

27:50.001 --> 27:53.254
-You'll pull my arm off.
-Hurry up then!

27:53.338 --> 27:55.256
I was sure I wanted to be a mom.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.217
I'm done playing.

27:59.719 --> 28:00.637
Hurry!

28:01.721 --> 28:03.682
-Oh!
-Come on!

28:03.765 --> 28:05.725
-One and two.
-Ouch!

28:05.809 --> 28:06.643
Come on.

28:06.726 --> 28:08.103
Ro, come on!

28:08.603 --> 28:10.063
Good, Juan Carlos. Let's go!

28:11.398 --> 28:13.608
Let's go!

28:14.359 --> 28:15.610
What happened?

28:15.694 --> 28:16.611
Are you okay?

28:17.737 --> 28:19.739
Are you okay?
Juan Carlos, are you all right?

28:24.536 --> 28:25.912
Let's go to the pool now!

28:27.747 --> 28:29.624
But I barely touched you.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.377
I don't want ointment.
I'm telling you, it barely hurts.

28:32.460 --> 28:36.506
-But it's very swollen.
-Why does everything have to be your way?

28:37.215 --> 28:39.718
Applying ointment
isn't doing things my way, silly.

28:39.801 --> 28:42.095
I don't mean the ointment,
it's everything.

28:42.178 --> 28:44.431
You make every decision 
for the both of us.

28:44.514 --> 28:47.225
We had found middle ground,
but you had to screw it up.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.272
Of course not. We can have everything

28:52.772 --> 28:54.566
as long as we support each other.

28:55.316 --> 28:57.944
And now, I need you to support me.

28:58.027 --> 28:59.738
Support you or adapt to you?

28:59.821 --> 29:03.533
You decided to accept a job
where you need to travel all the time.

29:03.616 --> 29:05.243
And I let you in on that.

29:06.828 --> 29:08.371
I never agreed to it.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.667
You know what, Juan Carlos?

29:13.960 --> 29:15.295
Grow up already.

29:16.087 --> 29:19.466
Yesterday, I finished
an amazing bottle of wine all by myself.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.176
I got drunk and it was awesome.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.094
We're in Valle de Bravo,

29:23.178 --> 29:26.514
everyone's outside having a blast, and I…

29:26.598 --> 29:29.225
with or without your permission,
will go do the same.

29:32.061 --> 29:35.273
And you know what?
If you need ointment, put it on yourself.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.411
Hey, I want to apologize to you…

29:49.454 --> 29:50.371
for everything.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.548
If you want Elena to be part of Konene…

30:01.341 --> 30:02.467
I'm in.

30:03.051 --> 30:03.927
Really?

30:06.554 --> 30:07.806
I trust your decision.

30:09.098 --> 30:10.600
-Ouch!
-Dad…

30:14.813 --> 30:16.648
It was all a misunderstanding.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.192
I was confused and I kissed him.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.277
I'm sorry, Dad.

30:21.861 --> 30:23.947
I didn't want things to blow up like this.

30:24.030 --> 30:27.116
Hey, you can talk
to me about anything. Okay?

30:27.784 --> 30:30.912
You'll always be my girl,
and I'm always here to protect you.

30:30.995 --> 30:31.913
Always.

30:33.957 --> 30:34.791
Thank you.

30:35.625 --> 30:36.584
Here I come!

30:37.085 --> 30:38.753
No, Pablo!

30:38.837 --> 30:40.880
-Oh, Pablo.
-Sorry!

30:42.549 --> 30:43.967
Here, let me have her.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.848
Careful, okay?

30:58.022 --> 30:58.898
Trust me.

31:02.610 --> 31:03.736
Oh, darling.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.030
Oh, sweetie.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.907
Your turn, Mariana, get in.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.618
-No, I'm okay here, thanks.
-The water is great.

31:10.702 --> 31:17.125
-Come, get in.
-Mariana!

31:17.208 --> 31:19.460
No, I said no! I can't swim!

31:20.253 --> 31:21.379
Are you happy now?

31:25.717 --> 31:26.843
Sorry, I didn't know.

31:26.926 --> 31:29.178
Mariana has always been afraid of water

31:29.262 --> 31:31.973
because when she was little,
I took her to Acapulco.

31:32.932 --> 31:35.059
I got distracted and a wave hit her…

31:35.143 --> 31:36.436
You got distracted?

31:37.145 --> 31:38.271
Yes, I got distracted.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.274
I got distracted
because a hot guy passed by

31:41.357 --> 31:43.318
and I turned away for a second, and…

31:43.401 --> 31:46.279
I thought she was over it,
turns out she's not.

31:46.821 --> 31:47.864
I'll be right back.

31:53.578 --> 31:56.539
-Pablo.
-Hey, easy, I can't hold my breath long.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.750
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you.

32:00.376 --> 32:02.378
Ceci told me how things happened.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.463
I owe you an apology.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.007
I would've done the same thing.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.551
You kept your cool.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.846
If someone tried to take advantage
of my baby, I'd kill him.

32:11.930 --> 32:15.642
If you need someone
to scare the assholes away, just call me.

32:15.725 --> 32:16.559
Sure.

32:20.688 --> 32:22.023
You shouldn't be ashamed.

32:22.106 --> 32:25.818
It's about overcoming your fear of water,

32:25.902 --> 32:29.030
feeling safe and trusting 
nothing will happen to you.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.950
That's exactly the problem.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.577
I don't think I've ever felt safe.

32:36.245 --> 32:40.249
I don't know, I grew up
mistrusting everything around me,

32:40.333 --> 32:41.584
starting with my mom.

32:42.210 --> 32:44.921
I don't know what the hell
she's doing here with Anuar.

32:48.132 --> 32:50.927
Mariana, only they know.

32:51.427 --> 32:53.930
And you shouldn't get involved
in their relationship.

32:54.514 --> 32:56.057
You need to learn to trust.

32:58.267 --> 32:59.394
Do you trust me?

33:05.358 --> 33:06.401
It's not a competition.

33:06.484 --> 33:09.779
This is something
we must all do together as a team.

33:10.613 --> 33:14.158
What's important is being calm

33:14.242 --> 33:18.496
so they can feel calm, at ease, confident.

33:18.579 --> 33:21.040
And the first step to learn how to swim

33:21.124 --> 33:23.501
is losing the fear of water…

33:25.044 --> 33:29.132
and for them to know that their family
will always be there to support them.

33:33.386 --> 33:34.429
Ready?

34:49.629 --> 34:50.463
Hello.

34:51.798 --> 34:55.134
I saw you trying to sabotage Anuar.
That's why you fell.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.178
What are you talking about?

34:58.096 --> 34:58.930
Fine.

34:59.597 --> 35:00.765
I don't blame you.

35:00.848 --> 35:03.434
The truth is,
I brought him to make it clear

35:03.518 --> 35:05.561
that nothing can ever happen
between us again.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.482
Then I thought it over and…

35:10.483 --> 35:13.027
I'm getting back together
with him for real.

35:15.196 --> 35:16.739
-I just wanted you to know.
-Tere.

35:19.742 --> 35:21.452
What you're doing is stupid.

35:22.787 --> 35:23.746
No.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.957
Anuar and I care about each other.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.959
So, we're going to give it a try.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.295
I need Mariana to trust me again.

37:00.801 --> 37:03.804
