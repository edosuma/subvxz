00:42.877 --> 00:45.713
Mom, did I wake you?

00:48.650 --> 00:50.384
She left already.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.360
I got it, mom.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.313
Are you
excited for Friday?

01:54.348 --> 01:55.449
Can't wait.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.219
What, are you afraid
of your Chinese parents

01:59.252 --> 02:00.521
meeting the new black in-laws?

02:02.690 --> 02:03.891
I'm sure it'll be fine.

02:06.326 --> 02:09.196
Yeah, that's what
you said about Candace.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.598
They love Candace now.

02:13.433 --> 02:14.902
That's 'cause she's half, bro.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.338
They like the white part.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.306
Go fuck yourself.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.341
Come on, let's
go, let's go, let's go.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.511
He's playing games right now.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.579
He's playing games.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.781
Yo.

02:26.814 --> 02:27.649
Hey.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.388
I'm not done with my slice.

02:34.421 --> 02:36.289
Come on, you lazy fuck.

02:43.698 --> 02:44.532
Hey!

02:45.633 --> 02:47.401
Aren't y'all supposed
to be in school?

02:48.569 --> 02:49.871
There's no school right now.

02:50.838 --> 02:51.673
Yeah?

02:52.540 --> 02:54.676
How come you're wearing
those book bags?

02:54.709 --> 02:56.678
We had school,
now there isn't any.

02:58.245 --> 03:00.548
Yeah, well those
bags look pretty heavy.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.616
What you guys got in them?

03:02.917 --> 03:03.718
Books.

03:05.920 --> 03:06.721
Books?

03:07.955 --> 03:08.756
Books?

03:09.957 --> 03:11.893
Hey, you want to show me?

03:11.926 --> 03:14.394
Man, I ain't got
to show you shit.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.367
Ah fuck.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.435
Don't fucking move.

03:22.770 --> 03:23.604
Stop!

03:24.839 --> 03:25.840
Hey, stop!

03:33.614 --> 03:34.615
Hey, stop!

03:38.986 --> 03:41.022
Are you fucking kidding me?

03:49.931 --> 03:50.765
Mike!

03:51.899 --> 03:52.734
Mike!

04:02.810 --> 04:03.644
Stop!

04:05.046 --> 04:06.547
Watch out!

04:09.316 --> 04:09.884
Fuck!

04:13.420 --> 04:14.354
You okay?

04:16.891 --> 04:17.692
You okay?

04:17.725 --> 04:19.392
I'm okay.

04:19.426 --> 04:22.496
Fuck, he's heading
back downstairs!

04:31.806 --> 04:32.640
Ma'am!

04:35.676 --> 04:36.511
Fuck.

04:37.612 --> 04:38.880
Ma'am, open up.

04:38.913 --> 04:40.815
Please, help
me, my son, he's been shot.

04:43.050 --> 04:43.951
He's been shot,

04:43.985 --> 04:46.319
I don't know what happened.

04:47.088 --> 04:47.989
Stay with us.

04:48.022 --> 04:48.823
Stay with me.

04:48.856 --> 04:49.690
How did this happen?

04:50.390 --> 04:53.094
Stay with me, come on, breathe.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.562
Breathe, Jordan.

04:55.897 --> 04:56.697
Why aren't you doing something?

04:56.731 --> 04:57.632
Where's the ambulance?

04:57.665 --> 04:59.432
Get the fuck over here.

05:02.003 --> 05:04.038
How did this happen?

05:04.071 --> 05:05.438
How did this happen?

05:05.472 --> 05:08.408
We need a bus, 2323
Grandview Avenue,

05:08.441 --> 05:10.545
shots fired, man down.

05:14.447 --> 05:15.482
Breathe.

05:16.651 --> 05:18.586
Responding,
what's your call sign?

05:18.619 --> 05:21.589
Nine Charlie, can we get
a confirmation on that bus?

05:22.990 --> 05:25.392
What the fuck?

05:25.425 --> 05:26.694
What happened?

05:26.727 --> 05:28.529
Give me the fucking phone.

05:28.563 --> 05:29.564
What the fuck?

05:29.597 --> 05:30.565
Give me the phone.

05:30.598 --> 05:31.532
You shot him!

05:35.503 --> 05:36.336
Do something

05:41.441 --> 05:42.577
All
right Officer Tan,

05:42.610 --> 05:44.411
I think that's about it.

05:44.444 --> 05:47.380
Make sure you're here tomorrow
night to meet with your rep.

05:47.414 --> 05:49.449
Go get changed and
clean yourself up.

07:27.281 --> 07:28.516
Ma.

07:30.685 --> 07:31.652
I'm sorry.

07:44.565 --> 07:45.199
Give me that.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.233
I got it.

07:50.738 --> 07:51.739
I couldn't get away.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.214
You okay?

08:38.319 --> 08:39.220
I'm fine.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.567
Not enough time to eat.

08:58.973 --> 09:00.808
Pepto is on the table.

09:03.010 --> 09:03.844
Okay.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.332
How are you feeling?

10:00.367 --> 10:01.602
Okay.

10:05.339 --> 10:07.942
I have a meeting with
my union rep tonight.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.144
Do you want me
to talk to my dad?

10:10.177 --> 10:12.279
No, I'll do that.

10:12.313 --> 10:14.215
I'm sure I'll see
him at the precinct.

10:22.323 --> 10:23.791
What are you doing today?

10:24.758 --> 10:27.895
I have a home visit
for a kid in Bay Ridge,

10:27.928 --> 10:31.799
and other than that
just the usual.

10:33.434 --> 10:36.704
You want some
company on the train?

10:38.205 --> 10:39.840
Do you just want me
to take the day off?

10:39.874 --> 10:40.674
I can switch with Kelly.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.009
No don't do that.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.412
I'll just text you
after the meeting.

10:46.347 --> 10:47.148
You sure?

10:49.350 --> 10:50.351
Yeah.

10:54.388 --> 10:55.389
Alright.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.436
When are you gonna
talk to your parents?

11:13.407 --> 11:15.309
I don't know.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.245
Mike, just tell
them what happened.

11:21.382 --> 11:23.150
I'll figure it out.

11:42.036 --> 11:42.870
Mike.

11:43.871 --> 11:44.705
Chief.

11:46.340 --> 11:47.408
How are you holding up?

11:49.410 --> 11:50.377
I'm okay.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.381
Coming in to see
your union rep?

11:54.415 --> 11:55.416
Yeah.

11:56.317 --> 11:57.484
Who is it? Ritchie Barrett?

11:58.786 --> 11:59.386
Yeah.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.423
He's got a good reputation.

12:02.456 --> 12:03.857
I'm sure he'll take care of you.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.897
Tell Candace and your parents
I'll be there Friday night.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.333
It's okay.

12:12.366 --> 12:15.069
Hey, I just checked.
Schedule's wide open.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.372
Okay.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.240
Great.

12:22.510 --> 12:23.511
Hang in there, kid.

12:29.016 --> 12:31.151
You two really fucked up.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.387
You're in a heap of
shit you realize that?

12:33.420 --> 12:36.357
Lucky for you this one
is pretty clear cut.

12:36.390 --> 12:40.127
Hard to prove intent when you
shoot someone through a wall.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.896
Now, the department
is going to conduct

12:42.930 --> 12:45.799
an official review, IAB
will be poking around,

12:45.833 --> 12:48.035
so get your story
straight and consistent,

12:48.068 --> 12:50.371
they're even gonna look
at all your old cases.

12:51.372 --> 12:53.274
Now you're off the street
for the next couple of weeks,

12:53.307 --> 12:56.210
paid leave, I don't wanna
hear a peep from you,

12:56.243 --> 12:58.379
so don't let me catch
you talking to the press.

12:58.412 --> 13:01.482
This is a PR nightmare
for the department.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.051
Here's my card,

13:05.119 --> 13:07.454
call me 24/7 if you need me,

13:08.856 --> 13:10.858
leave your gun with
Jackson down the hall,

13:12.493 --> 13:13.360
and don't worry,

13:14.962 --> 13:16.930
you'll be back on the
street before you know it.

13:22.303 --> 13:24.071
She never paid?

13:40.522 --> 13:42.524
She doesn't pay, we won't
do it again next year.

13:44.325 --> 13:45.059
Ma.

13:48.462 --> 13:49.597
Ma.

13:54.669 --> 13:56.437
Nevermind.

13:56.470 --> 13:57.304
Eat.

14:12.052 --> 14:12.886
I shot someone.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.357
What?

14:18.359 --> 14:19.393
Are they okay?

14:20.528 --> 14:21.362
He died.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.644
It was an accident.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.482
Not the kid we heard
about on the news right?

14:47.388 --> 14:50.190
What did
your parents say?

14:50.224 --> 14:52.393
My mom was trying to
make me feel better.

14:53.460 --> 14:57.599
I think my dad was worried and
just didn't want to show it.

14:57.632 --> 14:58.465
Hmm.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.102
Well, how are you doing?

15:06.273 --> 15:08.909
I'm good. I'm fine.

15:12.714 --> 15:13.548
Okay.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.153
Hey, Candace?

15:20.421 --> 15:21.321
Yeah?

15:23.357 --> 15:24.626
What are you doing right now?

15:24.659 --> 15:27.127
Well God
we thank you for today,

15:28.128 --> 15:31.165
and we thank you for the
life of Jordan Wiggins.

15:31.198 --> 15:33.568
His light will surely be missed.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.971
And God bless all
of our sons tonight,

15:38.005 --> 15:41.543
because we know that these are
difficult and trying times,

15:42.710 --> 15:45.513
but God we believe in the power

15:45.547 --> 15:47.682
of your healing and restoration.

15:49.283 --> 15:52.554
We believe in your light
and your mercy, oh God.

15:53.555 --> 15:56.390
We ask that you allow
your grace and your mercy

15:56.423 --> 15:58.992
to rein in this moment.

15:59.026 --> 16:02.129
On this plane or in
the next keep us safe,

16:02.162 --> 16:04.532
and may you forever
stand beside us.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.500
Amen.

16:06.534 --> 16:08.001
Amen.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.279
Hi, I'm Felicia Wiggins.

16:20.715 --> 16:24.485
Jordan was my son.

16:27.522 --> 16:30.023
He was a good son.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.059
He worked when he
was supposed to,

16:32.092 --> 16:34.394
he came home to me when
he was supposed to.

16:37.699 --> 16:39.132
Jordan was an artist.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.804
I see that a lot of you
put up some of his work.

16:42.837 --> 16:45.640
Thank you for that. He
would've like that, thank you.

16:48.676 --> 16:51.411
Thank you, Felicia.

16:54.582 --> 16:55.750
Why are we here today?

16:58.452 --> 17:01.188
Jordan was a good kid.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.724
Jordan was not a criminal.

17:04.358 --> 17:05.727
Jordan did not have a gun.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.063
So why are we here?

17:26.413 --> 17:27.615
Are you gonna be alright?

17:31.218 --> 17:34.154
I just wish they
knew what happened.

17:35.389 --> 17:37.559
I mean, they
know what happened.

17:37.592 --> 17:39.493
I mean like, how it happened.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.832
But that doesn't
change anything does it?

17:51.506 --> 17:52.740
You think I did
this on purpose?

17:52.774 --> 17:54.408
That's not what I said.

17:55.777 --> 17:57.579
It's just,

17:58.613 --> 18:00.347
I mean the guy's dead, and,

18:00.380 --> 18:02.550
I wasn't just gunning down
black people in the street,

18:02.584 --> 18:03.551
what the fuck do you think I am?

18:03.585 --> 18:04.719
That's not what I'm saying.

18:04.752 --> 18:06.721
You think I went to
work the other morning

18:06.754 --> 18:08.856
looking for some
black guy to shoot?

18:08.890 --> 18:09.757
I didn't do that.

18:09.791 --> 18:11.526
Mike. Shhh.

18:11.559 --> 18:14.161
Look I'm not one of those
fucking racist assholes.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.397
You think I wanted to kill him?

18:17.431 --> 18:19.366
That's not what I said.

18:26.273 --> 18:27.107
Look,

18:28.943 --> 18:32.412
you don't know what it's
like to grow up in a world

18:32.446 --> 18:34.281
where talking to a cop
could get you killed

18:34.314 --> 18:36.383
just because of the
color of your skin.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.686
It's just not something that
happens to someone like you.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.454
What and that happens to you?

18:42.422 --> 18:44.592
You're the daughter of a cop.

18:47.729 --> 18:50.698
You're right, I
don't know their lives,

18:51.566 --> 18:54.669
but my mom walked out on us

18:54.702 --> 18:57.872
because she couldn't deal
with the color of my skin.

18:58.973 --> 19:01.876
My dad gets dragged
up on that podium

19:01.909 --> 19:03.678
to be a black face
for the department

19:03.711 --> 19:06.380
every single time a black
man is shot in Brooklyn.

19:07.882 --> 19:10.484
So no, I don't have
the problems they have,

19:11.619 --> 19:14.756
but I have been dealing with
this bullshit my entire life.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.398
I love you.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.201
I believe you.

19:28.235 --> 19:31.606
I know you're not that,
but you can't expect them

19:31.639 --> 19:33.841
to know you like I do.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.493
Hey man.

19:53.528 --> 19:54.361
Hey.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.899
How's it going?

19:57.932 --> 20:01.569
It's going all right.
Good as it can I guess.

20:01.602 --> 20:03.604
Have you heard what
they're saying about us?

20:04.304 --> 20:05.707
You cannot listen
to that stuff,

20:05.740 --> 20:07.508
the press is looking
for headlines.

20:07.542 --> 20:08.543
There you go.

20:08.576 --> 20:09.409
Thanks, man.

20:10.578 --> 20:11.879
That kid was the
same age as us.

20:13.715 --> 20:15.248
There's an expression
in Chinese,

20:16.483 --> 20:19.520
"the gray haired burying
the black haired."

20:19.554 --> 20:21.455
I can't imagine
my mom burying me.

20:22.757 --> 20:23.958
It's too real.

20:25.459 --> 20:26.627
I killed him.

20:26.661 --> 20:27.795
Hey, hey!

20:27.829 --> 20:29.931
Seriously, don't say that.

20:29.964 --> 20:31.599
I know that you feel
guilty about this,

20:31.632 --> 20:33.000
but you can't be
going round the world

20:33.034 --> 20:34.936
saying that you
killed somebody, okay?

20:39.607 --> 20:41.542
My dad was telling
me this story,

20:41.576 --> 20:43.544
about this guy in
the 70s that he knew,

20:44.612 --> 20:45.646
killed this little white girl

20:45.680 --> 20:47.380
in the upper east
side, by accident.

20:48.415 --> 20:49.717
After the press took to him,

20:49.751 --> 20:51.886
it wasn't long before he
was kicked off the force,

20:51.919 --> 20:54.956
indicted, went to jail and
his family disowned him.

20:54.989 --> 20:57.725
They found him a year later
in a shitty Bronx apartment

20:57.759 --> 21:00.293
hanging from the top hook
of his fucking closet.

21:01.796 --> 21:03.463
This can go downhill fast,

21:03.497 --> 21:05.967
and if you're not careful,
we'll both go down with it.

21:07.835 --> 21:09.670
You shot him, it
was an accident.

21:10.671 --> 21:12.272
Remember that.

21:21.716 --> 21:23.383
I mean it was a horrible
thing that happened,

21:23.416 --> 21:24.652
but you're not to blame here.

21:26.821 --> 21:28.421
You were doing your job.

21:43.771 --> 21:45.973
Shit.

21:59.587 --> 22:01.522
No
justice, no peace,

22:01.556 --> 22:04.892
no justice, no peace,
no justice, no peace.

22:04.926 --> 22:07.595
Justice for Jordan.
Say his name.

22:18.906 --> 22:19.740
Mike.

22:21.008 --> 22:22.375
Hi.

22:22.409 --> 22:24.512
Now what's going
on, I'm a little busy.

22:24.545 --> 22:25.746
You've seen the video right?

22:25.780 --> 22:26.647
Uh-huh.

22:31.484 --> 22:32.419
I've been hearing people say-

22:32.452 --> 22:33.955
- Oh, don't listen to
what people are saying.

22:33.988 --> 22:35.723
A grand jury is a
standard procedure

22:35.756 --> 22:37.424
with something like this.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.491
Grand jury?

22:39.126 --> 22:40.895
It's a show!

22:40.928 --> 22:43.598
No cop's been indicted
for twelve years.

22:43.631 --> 22:44.497
When is this?

22:44.532 --> 22:45.733
In a few days.

22:45.766 --> 22:47.535
Now don't worry, go home,
keep your head down.

22:50.071 --> 22:52.607
Do I need to
testify? I can testify.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.876
Oh, I don't think
that's a good idea.

22:54.909 --> 22:56.476
They'll rip you apart.

22:56.510 --> 22:57.745
Everything you say is on record,

22:57.778 --> 22:59.446
you change any
part of your story

22:59.479 --> 23:00.748
it'll come back and
bite you in the ass.

23:00.781 --> 23:02.617
But if I tell the truth
my story won't change.

23:02.650 --> 23:04.451
You're not getting it.

23:04.484 --> 23:08.522
It's not about the truth, it's
about making you look bad.

23:08.556 --> 23:09.957
Officer Tan, what were you doing

23:09.991 --> 23:12.627
in the moments leading up to
the discharge of your firearm?

23:12.660 --> 23:14.427
I was in pursuit of a suspect.

23:15.529 --> 23:16.197
Ryan and I-

23:16.230 --> 23:17.598
- Officer Doheney.

23:18.465 --> 23:19.967
Officer Doheney and I were

23:20.001 --> 23:21.434
following a suspect
through the hall

23:21.468 --> 23:22.203
when he turned the corner.

23:22.236 --> 23:23.604
Which corner?

23:24.372 --> 23:25.539
Which one? The one
at the end of the hall?

23:25.573 --> 23:27.041
Which end east or west?

23:27.074 --> 23:29.610
It was, I think it was
the west end of the hall.

23:29.644 --> 23:32.647
You think? Well which
end was it Officer Tan?

23:32.680 --> 23:33.681
It was the west
end of the hall.

23:33.714 --> 23:34.615
And then what?

23:34.649 --> 23:36.851
The suspect turned the corner,

23:36.884 --> 23:38.519
and I pulled out my firearm.

23:38.552 --> 23:40.888
Now was that before or
after you turned the corner?

23:40.922 --> 23:41.822
Before.

23:41.856 --> 23:43.524
So you can definitively say

23:43.557 --> 23:46.227
that you pulled your firearm
before you turned the corner.

23:46.260 --> 23:47.228
It was before.

23:47.261 --> 23:49.030
And when did you call
for the suspect to stop?

23:49.063 --> 23:50.463
Ryan was the one that called-

23:50.497 --> 23:51.399
- Officer Doheney!

23:51.431 --> 23:52.767
Officer Doheney called
out for the suspect

23:52.800 --> 23:54.502
after he turned the corner.

23:54.535 --> 23:55.603
So you pulled your firearm

23:55.636 --> 23:57.038
before calling for
the suspect to stop?

23:58.272 --> 24:02.143
No, I don't think so.

24:02.176 --> 24:04.612
So you have no idea which
side of the hallway you were on,

24:04.645 --> 24:06.547
when you pulled your firearm,

24:06.580 --> 24:08.649
or when you called for
the suspect to stop?

24:15.556 --> 24:19.226
Go home, Mike. Don't worry
about it. Keep your head down.

24:20.528 --> 24:21.595
We got your back.

24:26.100 --> 24:28.035
Justice for Jordan!

24:28.069 --> 24:31.706
Protect and Serve!
No Justice. No Peace.

24:40.281 --> 24:41.282
Hey!

24:41.315 --> 24:42.116
Yeah, I see you!

24:42.149 --> 24:43.951
Camera shy now?

24:43.985 --> 24:45.720
You can't just walk away.

24:45.753 --> 24:47.621
To protect and to serve, right?

24:47.655 --> 24:50.524
You need to pay for
what you did to him!

25:12.346 --> 25:13.280
Oh, okay.

25:24.992 --> 25:27.261
Where did
you learn to do all this?

25:27.294 --> 25:30.164
A woman has to know
every piece of housework

25:30.197 --> 25:32.800
even if she doesn't
do it everyday.

25:32.833 --> 25:34.869
It's my mom's famous saying.

25:36.637 --> 25:37.972
Men in this family are useless.

25:39.006 --> 25:40.608
I'm sure it's not that bad.

25:40.641 --> 25:42.743
I don't think my brother
knows how to do his own laundry.

25:47.982 --> 25:50.084
I think you're
needed in the kitchen.

25:50.117 --> 25:52.920
Come sit. Your father's
beating me at this game.

26:04.198 --> 26:05.599
My boss gave me
the name of a guy

26:05.633 --> 26:07.668
who's one of the top
criminal defense lawyers.

26:07.701 --> 26:09.103
What?

26:09.136 --> 26:10.738
I don't need a lawyer.

26:10.771 --> 26:13.741
You have to take control of
these things. It's important.

26:13.774 --> 26:15.242
You can't just hope
that this goes away.

26:15.276 --> 26:17.978
I just went to see my
union rep a couple days ago,

26:18.012 --> 26:20.147
I'm handling it.

26:20.181 --> 26:21.082
Do you know how much stress

26:21.115 --> 26:22.616
this is putting on mom and dad?

26:25.419 --> 26:26.787
I get it.

26:26.821 --> 26:28.689
Well, then do
something about it.

26:35.262 --> 26:37.264
This is a feast.

26:37.298 --> 26:38.165
It's all her.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.235
Eat, eat, you guys start.

26:41.268 --> 26:43.204
Let me get you a fork.

26:43.237 --> 26:45.973
No, no, no need,
I prefer chopsticks.

26:46.006 --> 26:47.641
You sure? I'll get you one.

26:47.675 --> 26:49.810
I need to make sure
to turn off the stove.

26:49.844 --> 26:52.379
Ma, ma, ma, it's
off, sit down.

27:00.321 --> 27:03.224
Our son is still young,

27:03.257 --> 27:05.993
and he has a lot to
learn from you, sir.

27:07.461 --> 27:10.164
And we are really
happy to meet you.

27:12.199 --> 27:15.669
Candace, we spoiled Mike,

27:17.271 --> 27:19.974
and you have a lot of
immaturity to deal with.

27:20.975 --> 27:21.976
I wish you luck.

27:22.009 --> 27:22.877
Dad?

27:22.910 --> 27:24.044
Huh?

27:24.979 --> 27:27.748
To Mike and Candace.

27:27.781 --> 27:28.349
Yes, cheers!

27:30.017 --> 27:31.986
Cheers!

27:32.853 --> 27:34.355
Eat, eat.

27:34.388 --> 27:35.990
Eat when it's hot.

27:37.358 --> 27:38.392
My favorite.

27:39.460 --> 27:41.295
Do you want to try some tofu?

27:41.328 --> 27:42.696
Oh yes, please.

27:44.365 --> 27:45.199
Thank you.

27:52.373 --> 27:54.408
Sorry, I have to take this.

27:55.510 --> 27:57.178
Let's eat.

28:00.381 --> 28:01.882
Hello?

28:01.916 --> 28:04.351
Hey, Mike. Ritchie
Barrett. How you doing?

28:04.385 --> 28:05.853
I'm good. What's up?

28:07.388 --> 28:08.455
I'm sorry, Mike,

28:08.489 --> 28:10.858
the grand jury came
back this afternoon,

28:10.891 --> 28:12.026
you've been indicted.

28:13.294 --> 28:14.929
What?

28:14.962 --> 28:17.298
Don't worry, we can
meet before the arraignment.

28:18.933 --> 28:20.301
Arraignment? What the
hell are you talking about?

28:20.334 --> 28:22.336
We'll have our
best lawyer working with you,

28:22.369 --> 28:25.206
we are behind you 100%.

28:27.509 --> 28:28.342
Mike?

28:29.511 --> 28:31.011
What the-what the
fuck is going on?

28:31.045 --> 28:32.846
You'll be fine.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.782
Now you'll have to
turn yourself in

28:34.815 --> 28:36.984
first thing Monday morning.

28:37.017 --> 28:38.786
Is this because
I didn't testify?

28:39.453 --> 28:40.387
How the hell did I get indicted?

28:40.421 --> 28:42.356
What the hell happened?

28:53.033 --> 28:53.867
I gotta go.

28:55.369 --> 28:57.338
Sorry, Mike.

28:57.371 --> 29:00.341
Don't tell me you're
sorry, just go fix it.

29:01.408 --> 29:03.210
I'll text you
the address and everything.

29:03.244 --> 29:05.246
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

29:11.986 --> 29:12.786
Fuck.

29:30.337 --> 29:32.273
It's very good.

29:32.306 --> 29:33.140
I'm so glad.

29:34.875 --> 29:35.909
Is everything alright?

29:36.611 --> 29:37.579
Yeah.

29:57.532 --> 29:59.900
This duck is amazing!

29:59.933 --> 30:01.468
You gotta give me the recipe.

30:01.503 --> 30:03.404
Oh, it's really easy actually,

30:03.437 --> 30:07.341
the secret is to blow
dry it for two days.

30:07.374 --> 30:10.411
She means to air
dry it, air dry.

30:10.444 --> 30:12.079
Mom, blow dry is for hair.

30:14.381 --> 30:15.382
Cheers.

30:15.416 --> 30:16.250
Cheers.

30:18.419 --> 30:19.853
Thanks so much for everything,

30:19.887 --> 30:21.623
it was great meeting all of you.

30:21.656 --> 30:23.625
Just a little something
for you to bring to work.

30:23.658 --> 30:26.327
Oh thank you so much, Grace.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.494
It was so nice to meet you.

30:27.529 --> 30:29.463
This is so kind of you.

30:29.496 --> 30:30.331
Bye, darling.

30:33.367 --> 30:35.936
Hey, you'll be fine.

30:35.969 --> 30:36.604
Hang in there.

30:39.306 --> 30:40.107
Goodnight.

30:40.140 --> 30:41.442
Goodnight.

30:47.615 --> 30:50.552
I hope you
enjoyed the evening.

30:50.585 --> 30:52.019
Ma, Ba.

30:54.955 --> 30:56.056
I got indicted.

30:56.924 --> 30:59.927
What? What happened?

31:25.653 --> 31:27.421
Your bosses are here.

31:29.423 --> 31:31.058
Oh thank you.
We're not his bosses.

31:31.091 --> 31:32.059
Hey, Mike.

31:32.092 --> 31:32.993
Hey, how you doing?

31:33.026 --> 31:34.128
I want you to meet Bob Petke.

31:34.161 --> 31:36.230
He's in-house council
for the union.

31:36.263 --> 31:38.499
He came in this weekend
to meet with you.

31:38.533 --> 31:40.200
Yeah, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Mike.

31:40.234 --> 31:42.670
I'm sorry we're meeting
under these circumstances.

31:42.704 --> 31:44.539
It's so nice for
you guys to visit.

31:44.572 --> 31:45.507
Sit, sit.

31:45.540 --> 31:47.941
Thank you.

31:56.417 --> 31:58.520
I'll jump right in.

31:58.553 --> 32:02.289
I talked to the DA and
we've worked out a deal.

32:04.324 --> 32:05.492
A deal?

32:05.527 --> 32:08.696
If you plead guilty they'll
recommend minimum sentencing.

32:08.730 --> 32:11.198
It's 2 years. You'll
be out in 9 months.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.201
Wait, what?

32:15.670 --> 32:18.405
Can I get you a
soda? Some water?

32:18.439 --> 32:20.340
Or tea? We have good tea.

32:20.374 --> 32:21.676
That's all right thank you.

32:21.709 --> 32:23.110
No, I'm okay thank you.

32:32.352 --> 32:33.621
How could this have happened?

32:33.655 --> 32:36.156
This is a very high
profile case for them.

32:36.190 --> 32:38.358
It's an impossible situation.

32:38.392 --> 32:40.628
Impossible? You said
this was all going away.

32:40.662 --> 32:41.995
We're doing what we can,

32:42.029 --> 32:43.765
but we can't ignore
reality, Mike.

32:43.798 --> 32:45.767
You're being
charged with Man 2.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.469
That's a potential 15 years.

32:48.503 --> 32:51.038
You take this thing to trial,
you could see all of that.

32:51.071 --> 32:53.040
Two days ago you said this
was all going to blow over,

32:53.073 --> 32:54.676
and now I'm going to prison?

32:57.779 --> 32:59.313
Ma.

33:02.349 --> 33:03.518
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:09.223 --> 33:11.225
Lets not shoot the
messenger here, Mike.

33:11.258 --> 33:13.393
We're working for
you, all right?

33:13.427 --> 33:14.529
I mean, lets not fool ourselves,

33:14.562 --> 33:16.531
a kid is dead, you
pulled the trigger.

33:17.699 --> 33:19.366
It was an accident.

33:19.399 --> 33:22.069
Well unfortunately it's not
gonna play like that, Mike.

33:22.102 --> 33:25.507
The DA is going to
try this case herself,

33:25.540 --> 33:27.140
and with all the
press out there,

33:27.174 --> 33:29.611
the jury, they've already
made up their minds.

33:29.644 --> 33:33.380
This is a Brooklyn jury,
if we play the odds,

33:33.413 --> 33:34.782
you don't get a second chance.

33:44.458 --> 33:45.292
Come in.

33:46.460 --> 33:47.494
Hello, Cynthia,
how's it going?

33:47.529 --> 33:48.362
Bill.

33:51.198 --> 33:53.400
To what do I owe the pleasure?

33:53.433 --> 33:54.334
It's been a while.

33:54.368 --> 33:55.369
It has.

33:56.436 --> 33:57.805
How's your daughter doing?

33:57.839 --> 33:58.840
Good.

33:58.873 --> 33:59.707
And John?

34:01.341 --> 34:04.211
Still wasting his time
with all those books.

34:05.680 --> 34:07.549
That's good to hear.

34:10.718 --> 34:13.555
Cynthia, I'm sure you
can guess why I'm here.

34:15.590 --> 34:16.423
Why is that?

34:17.792 --> 34:22.262
He made a mistake.
He's a good kid, Cynthia.

34:22.296 --> 34:24.732
It doesn't matter
if he's a good kid.

34:24.766 --> 34:27.401
He broke the law and he needs
to face the consequences.

34:27.434 --> 34:30.370
Cynthia, he did not
intend to do this.

34:30.404 --> 34:31.673
Why are you here, Bill?

34:31.706 --> 34:33.373
Is this because
of your daughter?

34:33.407 --> 34:36.109
My daughter's
business is her own.

34:37.444 --> 34:39.714
Don't you know I empathize
with that family.

34:40.915 --> 34:42.449
I know their loss.

34:45.587 --> 34:48.188
I just don't think
this is right.

35:02.570 --> 35:03.638
All rise,

35:05.405 --> 35:07.675
for the honorable
Judge Sharon Mosca.

35:10.545 --> 35:11.378
Please sit.

35:14.749 --> 35:17.250
Ah, Ms. Kostas,
it's nice to see you

35:17.284 --> 35:18.485
popping your head
out of the office

35:18.519 --> 35:20.521
and getting in the trenches
with the rest of us.

35:20.555 --> 35:22.890
Just trying to serve justice
to my community your honor.

35:22.924 --> 35:24.424
Aren't we all?

35:24.458 --> 35:26.326
It's good to see you
as well, Mr Petke.

35:26.360 --> 35:27.562
Thank you, your honor.

35:27.595 --> 35:30.531
Okay, let's get
down to it counselors.

35:30.565 --> 35:32.867
Michael Tan, you
are charged with

35:32.900 --> 35:36.938
manslaughter in the second
degree and reckless endangerment.

35:36.971 --> 35:38.740
I understand there
is a deal proffered?

35:38.773 --> 35:39.741
That's correct your honor,

35:39.774 --> 35:41.375
the state offers
manslaughter two

35:41.408 --> 35:42.877
and a recommendation of leniency

35:42.910 --> 35:45.813
and minimum sentencing in
exchange for a plea of guilty.

35:46.914 --> 35:47.815
Mhm.

35:47.849 --> 35:49.249
How does the defendant plea?

35:56.758 --> 35:58.392
How do you plea, Mr. Tan?

36:05.265 --> 36:05.900
Not guilty.

36:14.441 --> 36:15.576
Settle.

36:16.443 --> 36:17.277
Settle.

36:26.319 --> 36:27.387
Settle.

36:28.255 --> 36:29.524
Settle.

36:29.557 --> 36:32.459
Ms Kostas, Mr Petke, did
you have an agreement

36:32.492 --> 36:34.428
before you came into
this courtroom today?

36:36.463 --> 36:38.766
Railroaded.
You've been railroaded.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.601
Two rookie cops shouldn't
even be paired together.

36:40.635 --> 36:41.836
That's outrageous.

36:41.869 --> 36:43.470
Honestly, I'm glad
you came to me now,

36:43.504 --> 36:45.540
but you should've come
to me a lot sooner.

36:45.573 --> 36:47.542
There's a lot we can do.

36:47.575 --> 36:49.443
First things first,
I need you to tell me

36:49.476 --> 36:51.478
anything you may have told
anybody about this case,

36:51.512 --> 36:53.280
and I mean anybody.

36:53.313 --> 36:55.550
That means your friends,
your family, colleagues,

36:55.583 --> 37:00.588
the barista at the corner coffee
shop, anybody, no suprises.

37:01.455 --> 37:01.889
I guess I told-

37:01.923 --> 37:02.824
- Not now.

37:02.857 --> 37:04.391
Think about it. Write it down.

37:04.424 --> 37:05.626
What about your partner?

37:05.660 --> 37:06.794
Did you get your
stories straight?

37:06.828 --> 37:08.261
He'll back me up.

37:08.295 --> 37:09.429
Well, make sure of
that. If we lose him

37:09.463 --> 37:10.397
this whole thing could go south.

37:10.430 --> 37:13.768
Lock up the story. Do
not talk to anybody else

37:13.801 --> 37:16.303
about this case
without me present.

37:16.336 --> 37:18.405
I'm gonna set you up with
some rebuttal testimony

37:18.438 --> 37:20.575
and I'm gonna get
you with my shrink.

37:20.608 --> 37:21.809
Uh, shrink?

37:21.843 --> 37:23.376
Yes, we need a psych
expert on our side.

37:23.410 --> 37:24.444
That's important.

37:24.478 --> 37:26.413
Now the most important thing,

37:26.446 --> 37:28.348
is to control the narrative.

37:28.381 --> 37:30.350
You're already being
vilified in the press.

37:30.383 --> 37:31.753
We need to change that.

37:31.786 --> 37:34.922
I've got someone at News26.
She'd love to do an interview.

37:34.956 --> 37:37.592
Talk to your parents. We
need to get them on camera.

37:38.826 --> 37:40.393
On camera?

37:40.427 --> 37:42.395
Look most of the jury's
gonna walk into that courtroom

37:42.429 --> 37:44.599
having already formed
an opinion about you.

37:44.632 --> 37:46.466
Let's make sure it's a good one.

37:46.500 --> 37:48.569
This is all about optics.

37:48.603 --> 37:50.938
Most people aren't gonna
actually watch the interview,

37:50.972 --> 37:52.405
but they are gonna
see a screenshot

37:52.439 --> 37:54.407
of Mike with his parents
sitting next to him.

37:54.441 --> 37:56.376
So even if they never
listen to a word he says

37:56.409 --> 38:00.413
they're gonna think, "Oh,
this is someone's son,

38:01.916 --> 38:03.718
and his parents are
standing by him."

38:05.887 --> 38:08.790
That image is the
most important part.

38:11.025 --> 38:12.727
Also, I think you
need to be there.

38:14.595 --> 38:18.331
I'm not sure I wanna do that.

38:18.365 --> 38:19.399
Look, I'm not
gonna lie to you.

38:19.432 --> 38:21.368
This case is about race.

38:22.335 --> 38:25.807
You think any of this would've
happened if Mike were white?

38:25.840 --> 38:27.108
The department
needed a scapegoat,

38:27.141 --> 38:28.643
they needed someone to
throw to the wolves,

38:28.676 --> 38:31.646
so they found someone they
thought was expendable.

38:31.679 --> 38:33.714
Also, a lot of the
discussion about this case

38:33.748 --> 38:36.083
is going to be about
the black issue.

38:36.117 --> 38:39.620
So, Candace, you
sitting next to Mike

38:39.654 --> 38:41.589
would send a very
powerful message.

38:43.090 --> 38:44.725
Look, you won't
even need to speak.

38:44.759 --> 38:45.893
I don't think
this is a good idea.

38:45.927 --> 38:47.862
If you follow my advice,

38:47.895 --> 38:48.930
you're gonna be okay.

38:50.865 --> 38:52.567
You're in good hands now.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.936
The DA's not gonna
know what hit her.

38:54.969 --> 38:56.671
So let me know as soon as
you talk to your parents,

38:56.704 --> 38:58.940
and I'll send over the
information about the shrink.

39:00.107 --> 39:01.542
I'm not gonna
do the interview.

39:01.576 --> 39:02.810
I don't want them on camera.

39:02.844 --> 39:03.376
Why are you so stubborn?

39:03.410 --> 39:06.514
That just cost me $1500.

39:06.547 --> 39:08.916
You think you know better than
the best lawyer in New York?

39:08.950 --> 39:10.084
I don't think he's right.

39:10.117 --> 39:12.019
This is about the accident.

39:13.187 --> 39:14.989
We shouldn't be
using mom and dad.

39:15.022 --> 39:18.425
We shouldn't be
using the race card.

39:26.466 --> 39:28.102
I don't want
you going to jail.

39:29.537 --> 39:31.806
So, if the interview
has a chance of helping,

39:33.975 --> 39:34.809
we should do it.

39:38.579 --> 39:40.081
I don't wanna put
you in that position.

39:41.883 --> 39:43.551
I want, I wanna do it.

39:52.693 --> 39:54.795
Make sure you think
before you speak.

39:56.797 --> 39:59.466
You don't want anything
coming back to haunt you.

40:01.002 --> 40:04.437
Whatever you do, remember
the words we said not to use.

40:06.073 --> 40:07.875
Repeat them back to me.

40:07.909 --> 40:12.079
Guilty, sorry, apologize...

40:13.648 --> 40:14.481
Regret.

40:16.951 --> 40:17.752
Let me.

40:17.785 --> 40:18.920
Oh, I-okay.

40:21.722 --> 40:23.891
I'm glad you are here.

40:23.925 --> 40:27.628
Now they can see
Mike is not racist.

40:30.564 --> 40:31.431
Yeah.

40:32.233 --> 40:33.634
What does this one mean?

40:33.668 --> 40:35.468
That's just a
standard release.

40:35.503 --> 40:36.504
It's basically
saying that we can

40:36.537 --> 40:38.005
use the footage
wherever we need.

40:39.173 --> 40:40.207
And I think your
lawyer's pretty much

40:40.241 --> 40:41.909
looked everything over already.

40:41.943 --> 40:43.110
Do we get to see the interview

40:43.144 --> 40:44.745
before it goes on TV?

40:44.779 --> 40:47.248
No, we don't do that, but we
can get you a courtesy copy.

40:47.281 --> 40:50.651
You won't be able to
change or edit it though.

40:50.685 --> 40:51.484
Okay.

40:52.520 --> 40:53.486
How are you doing?

40:54.555 --> 40:55.156
Okay.

40:56.223 --> 40:57.625
How you doing, Candace?

40:58.793 --> 41:00.594
Ready to get this over with.

41:00.628 --> 41:02.163
Great.

41:02.196 --> 41:05.633
Hi, excuse me, do you mind
if we get you mic'd up now?

41:05.666 --> 41:08.069
Oh, I thought
I wasn't talking?

41:08.903 --> 41:10.237
What?

41:10.271 --> 41:12.006
Oh, if you're
uncomfortable, that's fine.

41:12.039 --> 41:13.207
I just think it might
be good for Mike

41:13.240 --> 41:16.577
to see a little more
from his loving fiance.

41:16.610 --> 41:17.979
Figured you'd want that too.

41:19.814 --> 41:21.148
Yeah, of course it's fine.

41:21.182 --> 41:22.249
Great!

41:22.283 --> 41:24.518
I'll be back.

41:24.552 --> 41:26.587
I'm gonna check in
with the producers.

41:28.189 --> 41:31.625
If you can just turn
around towards me, okay,

41:31.659 --> 41:34.929
and then I'm just
gonna drop this down,

41:34.962 --> 41:36.664
Oh inside? Okay.

41:46.340 --> 41:47.742
We're not doing this.

41:47.775 --> 41:48.743
What?

41:48.776 --> 41:50.277
We're not doing it.

41:50.311 --> 41:51.145
Mike.

41:55.082 --> 41:57.151
Sorry, just one second.

41:58.352 --> 42:00.688
I don't want Candace
or my family on camera.

42:01.822 --> 42:03.591
Wait, why?

42:03.624 --> 42:05.126
Is this about the
Candace interview?

42:05.159 --> 42:06.594
Mike, we need that.

42:06.627 --> 42:08.295
No, I just don't
want them on camera.

42:08.329 --> 42:09.263
Are you sure?

42:09.296 --> 42:10.664
Because we're all set up.

42:10.698 --> 42:13.300
Take a minute, let's
talk about the strategy.

42:13.334 --> 42:15.269
No, I've made up my mind.

42:15.302 --> 42:16.804
No family or no interview.

42:18.606 --> 42:21.609
Alright. Alright,
I'll let them know.

42:25.379 --> 42:27.114
You're making a mistake, Mike.

42:28.215 --> 42:29.850
You're paying me for my advice,

42:29.884 --> 42:31.585
and yet you're
choosing to ignore it.

42:31.619 --> 42:34.789
You know, if you
wanna lose this trial,

42:34.822 --> 42:38.559
by all means, tell me,
but I'm on your side.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.262
See I'm just trying to
keep you out of prison.

42:43.064 --> 42:43.898
I understand.

42:47.868 --> 42:48.702
Fine.

42:52.973 --> 42:54.775
You sure you know
what your doing?

42:57.778 --> 42:59.146
No.

43:04.185 --> 43:06.654
Okay,
everyone let's settle in.

43:10.858 --> 43:12.593
Thank you
for doing this, Mike.

43:13.928 --> 43:15.329
Of course

43:15.362 --> 43:17.031
Is it your first
time on camera?

43:18.399 --> 43:19.266
Does YouTube count?

43:28.809 --> 43:30.277
Mom, he looks fine.

43:30.311 --> 43:31.946
Okay, we're
gonna roll camera and sound.

43:31.979 --> 43:33.414
Camera A speed.

43:33.447 --> 43:34.815
Sound speed.

43:34.849 --> 43:36.083
Camera B speed.

43:36.117 --> 43:38.185
Okay and Holly you
go ahead and take it

43:38.219 --> 43:39.320
whenever you're ready.

43:40.688 --> 43:43.424
Joining us today is
Officer Michael Tan,

43:43.457 --> 43:45.426
the officer involved
in the fatal shooting

43:45.459 --> 43:47.962
of Jordan Wiggins two weeks ago.

43:49.363 --> 43:50.731
I know you've been busy since

43:50.764 --> 43:53.067
the indicment came
down a few days ago,

43:53.100 --> 43:56.070
thank you for sitting down
and talking with me today.

43:56.103 --> 43:57.872
Thank you for having me.

44:03.978 --> 44:05.012
Hey.

44:05.045 --> 44:05.880
Hey.

44:15.356 --> 44:19.660
The funny thing is, I
forget I'm not one of them.

44:20.895 --> 44:22.296
It's only when something
like this happens

44:22.329 --> 44:25.666
that you get put exactly
where you should be.

44:28.869 --> 44:30.738
We're taught never to
air our dirty laundry.

44:30.771 --> 44:32.406
We're taught to
keep our heads down.

44:33.807 --> 44:35.242
Did you see the
other police shooting

44:35.276 --> 44:37.244
that happened in the Bronx?

44:37.278 --> 44:39.346
The guy shot
someone point blank.

44:41.382 --> 44:43.250
My brother's gun
went through a wall.

44:44.118 --> 44:47.821
Why does he have to pay
for these racist cops?

44:50.324 --> 44:52.193
They're just hanging
him out to dry.

44:54.361 --> 44:55.829
This is not a black
and white case.

44:55.863 --> 45:00.100
He didn't just look at
a black man and shoot.

45:01.468 --> 45:04.205
And I know I'm biased,
I love him, but

45:05.206 --> 45:07.474
where's the line?

45:29.531 --> 45:31.232
What time is it?

45:32.166 --> 45:33.734
Go back to sleep.

45:34.969 --> 45:37.304
Did Dean send those?

45:37.338 --> 45:38.172
Yeah.

45:46.313 --> 45:47.881
We look so young.

45:51.285 --> 45:53.120
It's been six weeks.

45:54.121 --> 45:54.955
Shit.

46:06.100 --> 46:08.068
I'm getting a lot of
flack from people, why?

46:08.102 --> 46:09.270
Why do you wanna go on TV

46:09.303 --> 46:11.905
and talk to everybody
about everything anyway?

46:11.939 --> 46:13.274
My lawyer thought
it was a good idea.

46:13.307 --> 46:16.277
They can use it against
you, you know that right?

46:16.310 --> 46:17.311
I'll tell you, never
trust a lawyer,

46:17.344 --> 46:18.879
they're always out
for themselves.

46:18.912 --> 46:19.547
Aren't we all?

46:22.584 --> 46:25.386
Well, you don't
want people to think

46:25.419 --> 46:27.488
you're turning your
back on the department.

46:27.522 --> 46:28.556
I'm not.

46:28.590 --> 46:30.324
It invites the
wrong kind of people.

46:31.626 --> 46:33.193
You don't wanna be
looking over your shoulder

46:33.227 --> 46:34.061
wherever you go.

46:38.600 --> 46:40.100
I'll remember that.

46:41.468 --> 46:42.303
You do that.

46:44.872 --> 46:47.007
How is Candace?

46:47.041 --> 46:49.176
All right I guess.

46:49.209 --> 46:50.344
As good as she can be.

46:52.946 --> 46:54.081
Gotta be hard on her.

46:55.015 --> 46:58.485
It'll be nice when
this whole thing's over.

47:02.222 --> 47:03.857
I'm really sorry, man.

47:03.891 --> 47:04.992
You already said that.
Don't worry about it.

47:06.193 --> 47:07.895
I know. I just
need to say it again.

47:09.363 --> 47:11.865
We're partners, I got
your back you've got mine.

47:41.261 --> 47:42.463
Hello?

47:42.496 --> 47:44.064
Hey, I'm
sorry babe, what's up?

47:44.098 --> 47:45.299
I'm out with Stephanie.

47:47.535 --> 47:48.369
Are you okay?

47:50.270 --> 47:51.539
I'm fine.

47:51.573 --> 47:54.341
Come over if
you want, we're at Joe's.

47:54.375 --> 47:57.679
No, it's okay, I'll just
grab something back at home.

47:57.712 --> 47:59.480
Are you
sure you're fine?

48:00.981 --> 48:02.416
We can meet up
after if you want?

48:04.418 --> 48:07.988
No, I'll just, no
you guys have fun.

48:09.323 --> 48:10.558
I have to go, I love you.

48:40.722 --> 48:44.425
That's a Glock 17.
Nine millimeter. Gen 4.

48:46.360 --> 48:48.128
It's a reliable gun, very safe,

48:48.162 --> 48:50.164
won't go off on
you accidentally.

48:54.368 --> 48:55.169
I'll take it.

48:55.202 --> 48:56.103
Great.

48:56.136 --> 48:57.404
If you can fill out this form,

48:57.438 --> 49:01.108
I'll need to see some ID
and your permit to carry.

49:03.377 --> 49:06.079
I was told you'd be able
to put in a rush order.

50:39.607 --> 50:40.474
Hold it!

50:46.581 --> 50:47.414
Hey!

51:13.541 --> 51:14.374
Mike.

51:16.511 --> 51:17.645
Hey, go back inside.

51:17.679 --> 51:19.379
What's going on?

51:29.256 --> 51:30.058
Hello?

51:32.326 --> 51:33.160
What?

51:35.362 --> 51:36.196
Okay.

51:49.544 --> 51:53.213
What now? You're
not on call tonight.

51:53.246 --> 51:56.383
You have to go, my
parents are coming.

52:08.696 --> 52:10.130
Mom, I know.

52:14.936 --> 52:17.437
Mom, it'll only be
for a few days, okay?

52:17.471 --> 52:18.940
I'll see you at Grace's.

52:18.973 --> 52:22.342
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

53:08.623 --> 53:11.526
Mike, why did you agree
to come in here, today?

53:13.027 --> 53:14.361
I know Larry told you to come,

53:14.394 --> 53:16.664
but you don't have to be here.

53:16.698 --> 53:18.365
Why did you want to come in?

53:18.398 --> 53:23.403
I want you to understand
my side of the story.

53:24.605 --> 53:25.573
It's important to
you that I understand

53:25.606 --> 53:27.642
your side of the story?

53:27.675 --> 53:30.912
Yeah, out there people
are calling me names,

53:32.312 --> 53:34.481
and I want you to know
I'm not those things.

53:35.382 --> 53:37.317
It's important to you
to be a good person.

53:37.350 --> 53:38.318
Of course.

53:38.351 --> 53:41.354
You know, my mom raised
me to be a good person,

53:41.388 --> 53:43.423
be kind, of course.

53:44.759 --> 53:46.728
How is your relationship
with your mother?

53:48.629 --> 53:49.463
We're good.

53:50.497 --> 53:51.866
You two are close?

53:54.702 --> 53:58.371
We're a close family,
it's just my sister,

53:58.405 --> 53:59.306
my parents and me.

54:00.273 --> 54:02.877
Now you're bringing
someone new into the family?

54:02.910 --> 54:03.745
Mhm

54:05.580 --> 54:08.850
Larry tells me your
fiance is African-American.

54:08.883 --> 54:10.518
Is that correct?

54:10.551 --> 54:11.886
Yeah.

54:11.919 --> 54:14.589
And your parents have
no issues about that?

54:16.691 --> 54:19.894
No, they love her.

54:23.798 --> 54:28.803
The boy who was shot, he's
African-American as well.

54:29.203 --> 54:30.303
Is that correct?

54:31.739 --> 54:32.573
Yeah.

54:34.575 --> 54:37.845
Do you generally get along
with African-American people?

54:37.879 --> 54:39.080
Why is everybody
trying to paint me

54:39.113 --> 54:40.915
like I'm some kind of racist?

54:40.948 --> 54:42.049
You know it could
have been anybody.

54:42.083 --> 54:43.416
That bullet went through a wall.

54:43.450 --> 54:44.719
I couldn't see who it was.

54:44.752 --> 54:45.753
It could've been
a Chinese family,

54:45.787 --> 54:47.320
it could've been a white family,

54:47.354 --> 54:48.589
anybody living in
that corner unit,

54:48.623 --> 54:50.323
so this has nothing
to do with race.

54:50.357 --> 54:53.460
How do you feel when someone
describes you as a racist?

54:53.493 --> 54:55.897
I grew up in Brooklyn.
There's black people everywhere.

54:55.930 --> 54:57.598
I'm fine with black people.

54:57.632 --> 55:00.367
I don't see things the way my
parent's generation sees it.

55:02.770 --> 55:03.638
How's that?

55:08.543 --> 55:11.478
They, they grew up in China,

55:11.512 --> 55:14.447
you know, where
people are homogenous.

55:14.481 --> 55:16.449
So how do you think they feel

55:16.483 --> 55:18.418
about African-American people?

55:18.451 --> 55:20.922
They used to be
scared of black people,

55:20.955 --> 55:22.322
because of the news.

55:24.457 --> 55:25.693
But you know, and
as police, you know,

55:25.726 --> 55:28.395
we, like statistically speaking,

55:28.428 --> 55:30.463
the crime rates are higher.

55:30.497 --> 55:31.566
But also that has
to do with like,

55:31.599 --> 55:33.466
economy and education.

55:34.735 --> 55:36.838
My parents' friends are
not as diverse as mine,

55:36.871 --> 55:38.405
but they've been
here a long time.

55:38.438 --> 55:40.007
They understand the
world that we live in.

55:40.041 --> 55:41.642
They understand that black
people are not bad people

55:41.676 --> 55:44.045
and that Chinese people are
not better than anybody else.

56:09.770 --> 56:12.740
Hi Mike, this is
Holly Crane from News26.

56:12.773 --> 56:14.175
I just wanted to know
if you'd like to comment

56:14.208 --> 56:15.676
on the press conference
this morning.

56:15.710 --> 56:18.445
Perhaps we can set
something up in the studio.

56:18.478 --> 56:20.548
Also, it might be good if
Candace can join us as well,

56:20.581 --> 56:22.049
I know our viewers
would really love

56:22.083 --> 56:23.951
to hear her perspective
on everything that's hap-

56:32.593 --> 56:34.494
- Thank you for
coming here today.

56:35.495 --> 56:36.664
Due to the heightened tensions

56:36.697 --> 56:38.465
on both sides of this trial,

56:39.533 --> 56:40.935
I ask that people remember that

56:40.968 --> 56:45.206
Officer Tan is innocent
until proven otherwise,

56:45.239 --> 56:47.575
but with the recently
acquired testimony

56:47.608 --> 56:50.578
of Officer Ryan Doheney,

56:50.611 --> 56:53.948
it is my determination,
that the initial filing

56:53.981 --> 56:56.984
of manslaughter in the
second degree is justified.

57:04.125 --> 57:05.559
Come on, Ryan, you shit!

57:06.527 --> 57:07.828
Open the door!

57:10.231 --> 57:12.533
Open the door! I
know you're in there!

57:14.602 --> 57:17.838
I know you're in
there fucking asshole!

57:26.280 --> 57:27.515
Hey!

57:29.617 --> 57:30.851
Turn the fuck around.

57:30.885 --> 57:31.819
What do you want?

57:32.987 --> 57:35.156
Did you ever give
a fuck about him?

57:35.189 --> 57:37.658
Did you ever care
about Mike, at all?

57:38.993 --> 57:41.128
You don't know what
you're talking about.

57:41.162 --> 57:43.097
I know that he wouldn't
even be in this mess

57:43.130 --> 57:44.598
if it wasn't for you,

57:44.632 --> 57:45.800
so don't act like you're
so innocent in all of this.

57:45.833 --> 57:48.970
We went after a guy,
cause that's what we do,

57:49.003 --> 57:52.206
we're fucking cops, we go
after people who look shady.

57:52.239 --> 57:53.140
People who look shady!

57:53.174 --> 57:56.243
I'm not the one who
fucking shot someone.

57:56.277 --> 57:59.814
It was an accident.
His gun went off.

57:59.847 --> 58:01.015
And how is that?

58:02.049 --> 58:04.618
My gun didn't go off, cause
my hand wasn't on the trigger,

58:04.652 --> 58:07.188
because I didn't pull it
out when I didn't need to.

58:14.161 --> 58:15.563
You're a fucking asshole.

58:17.932 --> 58:19.066
I hope you drown.

59:28.169 --> 59:29.170
You're back early.

59:30.671 --> 59:32.173
What's all this?

59:32.206 --> 59:34.608
I thought I'd
cook dinner for you.

59:42.216 --> 59:43.084
I'm almost done.

1:00:02.303 --> 1:00:03.270
Hey.

1:00:03.304 --> 1:00:04.138
Hey.

1:00:05.206 --> 1:00:08.275
So I've got 20 minutes

1:00:08.309 --> 1:00:12.246
before I have to take
that out of the oven.

1:00:12.279 --> 1:00:13.414
Okay.

1:00:13.447 --> 1:00:15.816
So, take your pants off.

1:00:28.696 --> 1:00:32.133
Hold on let's just slow
down for a minute all right.

1:00:34.869 --> 1:00:35.703
What's up?

1:00:38.372 --> 1:00:40.975
Look, it's just
that I just got home,

1:00:42.209 --> 1:00:44.044
I need a minute, okay?

1:00:49.283 --> 1:00:50.284
Yeah. Fine.

1:00:55.322 --> 1:00:56.357
Hey, I'm sorry.

1:00:56.390 --> 1:00:57.391
It's fine.

1:01:12.507 --> 1:01:14.341
What is your problem?

1:01:14.375 --> 1:01:15.910
What?

1:01:15.943 --> 1:01:18.345
Is it so offensive I don't
want to have sex right now?

1:01:19.947 --> 1:01:21.782
We always do everything
you want, when you want it.

1:01:25.386 --> 1:01:28.355
I'm trying to do something
nice for you, okay?

1:01:28.389 --> 1:01:30.791
Well maybe you can
ask me what I want.

1:01:31.959 --> 1:01:33.327
Instead of jumping on top of me.

1:01:37.498 --> 1:01:39.333
You know what? Forget it.

1:01:39.366 --> 1:01:41.335
You don't appreciate anything.

1:01:41.368 --> 1:01:42.870
I don't appreciate anything?

1:01:44.138 --> 1:01:45.372
Do you know what
kind of day I've had?

1:01:45.406 --> 1:01:47.441
Why do you think I'm
cooking for you, asshole?

1:02:13.901 --> 1:02:14.735
I'm sorry.

1:02:26.013 --> 1:02:27.448
I'm sorry about Ryan.

1:02:31.885 --> 1:02:33.521
Karma will come back around.

1:02:39.561 --> 1:02:40.928
Candace, I-.

1:04:00.542 --> 1:04:02.309
Go back to sleep.

1:04:07.348 --> 1:04:10.217
I gotta go. I have
meetings all day.

1:04:10.250 --> 1:04:13.320
But maybe we could grab dinner?

1:04:13.354 --> 1:04:14.188
Sounds good.

1:04:15.322 --> 1:04:16.857
See you tonight.

1:04:28.469 --> 1:04:29.303
Oh shit.

1:04:30.471 --> 1:04:32.306
Hi. This
is Holly Crane.

1:04:32.339 --> 1:04:35.943
I'm not available-

1:04:42.416 --> 1:04:44.184
Excuse me.

1:04:44.218 --> 1:04:45.319
For deliveries you
have to call up

1:04:45.352 --> 1:04:46.920
and have them come meet you.

1:04:48.590 --> 1:04:50.558
Not delivery, I'm
here for News26.

1:04:50.592 --> 1:04:52.359
Your name?

1:04:52.393 --> 1:04:53.994
Mike Tan. I'm not on the list,

1:04:54.027 --> 1:04:55.530
I'm here to see Holly Crane.

1:04:57.665 --> 1:05:02.035
Yeah, I have a Mike Tan
here to see Holly Crane.

1:05:04.438 --> 1:05:05.272
I see.

1:05:06.407 --> 1:05:07.341
She's not at her desk.

1:05:09.343 --> 1:05:10.177
Thanks.

1:05:11.345 --> 1:05:12.312
Sorry, but you're
gonna have to wait.

1:05:12.346 --> 1:05:13.380
I'm gonna need to go up.

1:05:16.083 --> 1:05:17.050
23rd floor.

1:05:19.052 --> 1:05:20.154
Hey, I'm so glad I caught you.

1:05:20.187 --> 1:05:21.656
Mike, I saw your missed calls,

1:05:21.689 --> 1:05:23.056
I was just about
to get back to you.

1:05:23.090 --> 1:05:24.158
Sit, sit.

1:05:26.226 --> 1:05:28.563
I just wanna make sure that

1:05:28.596 --> 1:05:31.031
you don't use the photo
on the news tonight.

1:05:31.064 --> 1:05:32.199
I'll even give an
interview if you need it.

1:05:32.232 --> 1:05:35.369
It's just really important
that you do not use that photo.

1:05:35.402 --> 1:05:37.237
It's already up
online, you know?

1:05:38.573 --> 1:05:39.741
What?

1:05:39.774 --> 1:05:41.509
Our digital department
posts everything

1:05:41.543 --> 1:05:44.411
almost immediately now. It's
been up since last night.

1:06:02.697 --> 1:06:04.632
Hey, this is
Candace. Leave a message.

1:06:22.416 --> 1:06:23.651
I'll let you guys talk.

1:06:31.626 --> 1:06:32.794
Please let me explain.

1:06:32.827 --> 1:06:34.361
I don't wanna talk about it.

1:06:38.432 --> 1:06:40.033
I made a mistake.

1:06:41.736 --> 1:06:44.404
You know ever
since this happened,

1:06:44.438 --> 1:06:46.473
I've had people come
up to me and say,

1:06:46.508 --> 1:06:48.576
"How can you be with
someone like that?

1:06:50.444 --> 1:06:54.381
Candace, you're black, how
can you marry a racist cop?"

1:06:55.583 --> 1:06:59.386
And I tell them, "You don't
know what you're talking about,

1:06:59.419 --> 1:07:00.622
he's not like that."

1:07:02.256 --> 1:07:05.660
I stood by you. And in case
you haven't noticed, Mike,

1:07:05.693 --> 1:07:06.694
I am black.

1:07:10.832 --> 1:07:12.199
Well, I guess you have.

1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:14.636
Babe, please let me explain.

1:07:44.298 --> 1:07:47.401
I think we did it,
because after the response

1:07:47.434 --> 1:07:49.336
we've been getting
since the interview,

1:07:49.369 --> 1:07:51.271
and after that
photo you published,

1:07:51.305 --> 1:07:52.507
I really think the
tide's beginning

1:07:52.540 --> 1:07:54.374
to turn in your favor.

1:07:54.408 --> 1:07:57.144
The opinion polls are up 20%,

1:07:57.177 --> 1:07:59.814
and I think by the
time we go to trial

1:07:59.847 --> 1:08:01.181
you're gonna have the support

1:08:01.214 --> 1:08:02.684
of the entire
Brooklyn community.

1:08:04.484 --> 1:08:06.119
Things are really looking up.

1:08:07.421 --> 1:08:09.122
I think we're gonna
win this thing.

1:08:48.495 --> 1:08:52.734
Mom, I told you that the
cleaning lady comes once a week.

1:08:55.903 --> 1:08:57.471
When do I have time to cook?

1:09:14.589 --> 1:09:15.422
Eat.

1:09:17.992 --> 1:09:18.826
Eat.

1:09:55.429 --> 1:09:56.564
Make better decisions.

1:10:07.441 --> 1:10:09.409
Ba, what's wrong?

1:10:09.443 --> 1:10:10.477
Shhh.

1:10:12.714 --> 1:10:14.549
I don't want your
mother to hear.

1:10:17.417 --> 1:10:18.452
What is it?

1:10:23.791 --> 1:10:26.493
You wanna tell me why I
found a gun in my house?

1:10:30.665 --> 1:10:34.035
You found a gun in the house?

1:10:34.068 --> 1:10:35.570
Don't play dumb with me.

1:10:37.471 --> 1:10:39.272
You remember what you
promised your mother

1:10:39.306 --> 1:10:41.308
when you started
this police thing?

1:10:42.409 --> 1:10:43.644
We were in danger.

1:10:43.678 --> 1:10:45.345
When you bring a
gun into our lives

1:10:45.378 --> 1:10:46.848
you put us all in danger.

1:10:48.415 --> 1:10:49.617
You wanna get yourself killed.

1:10:49.650 --> 1:10:51.351
No one was gonna get hurt.

1:10:52.486 --> 1:10:54.555
Did you think anyone
was gonna get hurt

1:10:54.589 --> 1:10:55.957
when that boy was shot?

1:10:57.058 --> 1:10:58.526
It only takes one shot,

1:10:59.493 --> 1:11:00.995
whether it's on purpose or not.

1:11:06.366 --> 1:11:06.968
Yeah.

1:11:11.939 --> 1:11:14.407
You know how much your
mother wants grandchildren?

1:11:16.409 --> 1:11:17.044
What?

1:11:18.579 --> 1:11:20.681
You know if something
happens to you,

1:11:20.715 --> 1:11:22.850
she might never
have grandchildren,

1:11:22.884 --> 1:11:24.752
you wanna take
that away from her?

1:11:26.419 --> 1:11:28.421
And you know Grace is
not gonna give us any,

1:11:28.455 --> 1:11:30.490
you think we don't know?

1:11:30.525 --> 1:11:32.392
You are her only chance.

1:11:36.964 --> 1:11:37.932
You are so selfish.

1:11:39.432 --> 1:11:41.569
Your whole life, you
think about yourself.

1:11:43.470 --> 1:11:46.439
Why don't you think
about others for once?

1:11:46.473 --> 1:11:47.307
Michael.

1:11:50.645 --> 1:11:51.679
Do you have any idea,

1:11:53.948 --> 1:11:55.850
how a mother feels
to lose a son?

1:11:57.652 --> 1:11:59.486
Your mom would never recover.

1:12:02.857 --> 1:12:04.525
You get that gun
out of my house.

1:12:24.145 --> 1:12:25.378
Mom.

1:12:25.412 --> 1:12:26.647
Did I wake you?

1:12:29.584 --> 1:12:30.852
She left early.

1:12:39.594 --> 1:12:40.761
I got it, Ma.

1:13:38.619 --> 1:13:39.486
Thanks, Mom.

1:14:28.302 --> 1:14:29.704
Buzzer's broke.

1:15:14.815 --> 1:15:16.717
One second.

1:15:37.304 --> 1:15:38.272
Mrs. Wiggins?

1:15:45.279 --> 1:15:49.116
I understand if you don't
want to speak to me.

1:15:56.690 --> 1:15:59.193
But I just wanted you to know,

1:16:01.395 --> 1:16:02.229
I'm sorry.

1:16:14.108 --> 1:16:15.910
I wanted to tell you that,

1:16:17.645 --> 1:16:19.280
I'm gonna go to the DA tomorrow,

1:16:20.414 --> 1:16:21.615
and tell her

1:16:23.284 --> 1:16:24.318
that I'm guilty.

1:16:32.093 --> 1:16:36.330
I just wanted you to be
the first one to know that.

1:16:44.371 --> 1:16:46.373
I'm sorry I took your
son away from you.

1:17:28.749 --> 1:17:29.383
Chief.

1:17:32.052 --> 1:17:32.887
Chief. Hey.

1:17:33.854 --> 1:17:34.688
Mike.

1:17:35.789 --> 1:17:37.124
Hey, can I just-

1:17:37.158 --> 1:17:38.459
if I could just talk
to you for a second.

1:17:38.492 --> 1:17:39.760
I have to get home.

1:17:40.995 --> 1:17:41.829
Chief, please.

1:17:43.797 --> 1:17:44.765
What do you want?

1:17:48.369 --> 1:17:49.837
Candace won't
talk to me and I-

1:17:49.870 --> 1:17:50.838
- I don't blame her.

1:17:53.374 --> 1:17:54.708
Please.

1:17:54.742 --> 1:17:56.377
What is it you
want me to do, Mike?

1:17:57.311 --> 1:17:58.913
You want me to explain to her

1:17:58.946 --> 1:18:01.315
why you plastered her
picture all over the internet

1:18:01.348 --> 1:18:03.817
saying, look I'm not a racist,

1:18:03.851 --> 1:18:04.985
I got a black girlfriend.

1:18:05.019 --> 1:18:05.953
I made a mistake.

1:18:05.986 --> 1:18:07.454
You made a choice.

1:18:08.355 --> 1:18:10.157
Now you have to live with it.

1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:14.195
Goodbye, Mike.

1:19:17.291 --> 1:19:18.959
Candace.

1:19:18.993 --> 1:19:21.095
You need to
leave my dad out of this.

1:19:21.128 --> 1:19:22.196
Candace, I'm so sorry.

1:19:22.229 --> 1:19:24.031
Yeah, I don't wanna hear it.

1:19:24.064 --> 1:19:26.000
You know, all I've ever
asked for is honesty,

1:19:26.033 --> 1:19:27.368
and I thought we were
in this together,

1:19:27.401 --> 1:19:29.303
and you tricked me.

1:19:29.336 --> 1:19:32.072
You did exactly what the
department does to my dad.

1:19:32.106 --> 1:19:33.474
You're no better than they are.

1:19:35.309 --> 1:19:36.143
I got scared.

1:19:41.148 --> 1:19:41.982
Candace,

1:19:44.118 --> 1:19:46.353
I'm gonna go to the DA tomorrow,

1:19:49.156 --> 1:19:50.491
I'm gonna tell them I'm guilty.

1:19:52.594 --> 1:19:55.996
I took his life, and his mother,

1:19:56.030 --> 1:19:58.499
she's never gonna see her son
again and that's my fault.

1:20:11.445 --> 1:20:12.413
Can I see you?

1:20:17.652 --> 1:20:20.321
I don't know what
it is you can say.

1:20:20.354 --> 1:20:22.624
We don't have to say anything,

1:20:22.657 --> 1:20:24.892
all right just stay
there, I'll be right over.

1:20:28.395 --> 1:20:29.229
Okay.

1:20:50.217 --> 1:20:51.385
How you doing tonight, sir?

1:20:52.620 --> 1:20:54.054
Gun!

1:20:54.088 --> 1:20:55.055
No, no, it's not
what it looks like.

1:20:55.089 --> 1:20:55.557
- Don't move!
- I'm a cop!

1:20:57.358 --> 1:21:00.662
Shots fired, shots fired,
near 93-near 43rd and 1st,

1:21:00.695 --> 1:21:02.162
we need a bus immediately.

1:21:03.197 --> 1:21:05.332
Copy,
shots fired at 43rd and 1st,

1:21:07.368 --> 1:21:08.369
Fuck.

1:21:13.173 --> 1:21:14.475
Fuck.

1:21:33.127 --> 1:21:33.961
Hello?

1:21:37.364 --> 1:21:38.399
What?

1:25:11.573 --> 1:25:16.573
