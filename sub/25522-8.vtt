01:42.895 --> 01:45.438
Goddamn Martha Stewart funeral.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.110
What if, after you die,

01:51.195 --> 01:54.572
part of you goes to heaven,
but part of you stays here?

01:54.656 --> 01:56.783
Goddamn Mother of the Year.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.786
Just to see
how things turn out...

01:59.870 --> 02:01.162
And then she burned her.

02:01.246 --> 02:05.166
- For you... For Mama.
- Cremated.

02:13.091 --> 02:17.094
Hello, darling. Sit down.
Have dinner with us.

02:18.138 --> 02:22.558
Special occasion.
I set a place for you.

02:22.643 --> 02:26.437
"Occasion" means cake, Mama.

02:27.064 --> 02:28.231
You promised.

02:28.899 --> 02:32.109
Now that the Keene boy's
been arrested,

02:32.861 --> 02:34.487
our little girl is finally safe.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.990
I can't even say
the relief I feel.

02:38.075 --> 02:41.244
Yep. All is well at last.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.620
Is it?

02:43.914 --> 02:45.915
I don't think John Keene is a killer.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.333
Of course you don't.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.128
Camille, sit down.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.217
Sit down.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.020
I suppose this means you'll be
heading back to St. Louis shortly.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.146
Story's over.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.399
I hope he gets
the death penalty.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.110
Babykiller Keene.

03:14.361 --> 03:17.738
Turns out, Missouri is
the fifth most productive state

03:17.823 --> 03:20.199
in terms of carrying out executions.

03:20.284 --> 03:23.119
We had to stop. It was...

03:23.203 --> 03:26.789
The fluid was controversial.
I think, um...

03:27.207 --> 03:29.417
Yeah, I think it wasn't
killing people well enough.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.836
Well, in any case, um...

03:33.797 --> 03:36.757
I just read that
we import it from Romania.

03:38.176 --> 03:41.262
- Fluid?
- For lethal injection, sweetie.

03:43.974 --> 03:47.560
Needles. Like the needles
I get sometimes?

03:47.644 --> 03:52.023
Very different.
Like putting a cat to sleep.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.652
Well, I hope he gets the needle.

03:58.614 --> 04:01.741
Guess which Greek goddess
I am, Camille.

04:03.327 --> 04:06.621
I guess I'm not really
up on my goddesses.

04:08.749 --> 04:12.209
I'm Persephone.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.796
Queen of the Underworld.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.342
She's married to that...

04:20.469 --> 04:21.802
Big dude.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.931
Hades.

04:25.015 --> 04:28.935
He runs Hell, but she's
in charge of punishment.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.605
But I feel sorry for Persephone

04:32.689 --> 04:35.733
because, even when
she's back with the living,

04:35.817 --> 04:39.695
they're afraid of her
because of where she's been.

04:40.614 --> 04:44.075
Kind of funny?
How many stories they have

04:44.159 --> 04:48.955
where princesses
need to get rescued from witches.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.123
Wind Gap has one, even.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.377
Little girls yanked from the woods
by the Woman in White.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.836
I don't like that one.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.713
Too close to home?

04:59.466 --> 05:04.512
Would you be more sad
if John died or I died?

05:08.642 --> 05:11.310
I don't want anybody to die.

05:11.395 --> 05:15.523
Wind Gap
has too much death as it is.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.233
Hear, hear.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.778
Camille, that food's
not gonna eat itself.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.738
Or aren't you feeling well?

05:25.450 --> 05:28.661
Just a little off.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.413
Your editor must be excited

05:30.497 --> 05:33.290
about getting his
intrepid girl reporter back.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.792
What will you work on next?

05:34.876 --> 05:38.838
Maybe something more upbeat
for a change.

05:41.425 --> 05:42.675
In any case,

05:42.759 --> 05:45.678
I'm sure he's happy to have you
back where you belong.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.309
Well, Mama...

05:54.688 --> 05:57.982
I was thinking that with everything
going on in town, all the trouble,

05:59.568 --> 06:01.152
it might be nice to have Amma

06:01.236 --> 06:03.404
come stay with me
in St. Louis for a while.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.949
Little change of pace
might do her good.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.789
Well...

06:15.208 --> 06:19.170
That is a truly remarkable suggestion.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.839
That's a wonderful offer, dear.

06:22.424 --> 06:26.093
But impossible.
She's starting school soon.

06:26.845 --> 06:30.681
I think it would be nice
to see that big old arch.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.312
Did you two discuss this already?

06:37.022 --> 06:40.024
No. I just thought that...

06:43.487 --> 06:44.528
Amma.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.449
Your color is high.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.995
Are you feverish?

06:53.622 --> 06:56.540
God. You're as hot as an oven.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.834
- I want cake.
- No, you have to lie down.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.962
-I want cake.
-I will bring you cake later.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.298
Please eat, Camille.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.008
We'll say our goodbyes in the morning.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.344
-I want cake.
-Come on, sweet.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.888
Come on, sweet. Come on.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.349
You can have cake.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.482
Dinner is not finished, Camille.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.234
Ma.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.196
- Mama!
- Adora!

07:27.280 --> 07:31.408
- Mama. God.
- Help me.

07:31.493 --> 07:32.993
- What's going on, sweetheart?
- I don't know.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.578
- Okay, come on.
- Help her up.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.163
-Mama's here. Hold on.
-What's going on?

07:36.248 --> 07:39.834
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.505
It's all right. It's okay.
It's all right, dear.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.343
- I got you.
- Okay.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.599
You may come in, darling.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.196
Take your clothes off.

09:25.690 --> 09:29.985
Do you see how nice it is
not to have to worry or fight?

09:31.279 --> 09:33.822
Just to let yourself be looked after?

09:34.074 --> 09:36.075
Yeah.

09:36.993 --> 09:40.829
This will be good for both of us.
Don't you think?

09:41.456 --> 09:43.123
Yes.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.350
Open, darling.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.358
You are such a good girl.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.947
More, Mama.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.124
Yes.

10:26.543 --> 10:30.045
Now rest.
I'll fix your dosage for the night.

12:08.770 --> 12:12.481
- How'd you sleep, son?
- Why am I even here?

12:13.066 --> 12:15.818
Well, the thing is, John,

12:15.902 --> 12:18.237
your girl, Ashley, she gave you up.

12:21.241 --> 12:25.202
So, she... She said I did it,
or she thinks I did it?

12:25.870 --> 12:28.205
She led us to evidence.
What do you think that was?

12:28.289 --> 12:29.456
I got no idea.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.252
She wasn't getting
what she wanted from me.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.505
Sometimes you stay with somebody,
and the only reason is

12:36.589 --> 12:39.341
because you don't have the energy
to go through ending it.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.676
All the fights and the scenes.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.511
And with Ashley,
it was gonna be a scene.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.098
And then
Natalie happened, and...

12:48.017 --> 12:49.768
I don't know, I could barely...

12:50.895 --> 12:54.648
Ashley was there,
but I wasn't, really. You know?

12:54.732 --> 12:56.024
Natalie "happened."

12:57.777 --> 12:58.819
Yeah.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.572
Yeah, somebody killed
my little sister.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.825
Not me.
Do you want me to say it again?

13:04.909 --> 13:06.034
Want me to fucking write it down?

13:06.119 --> 13:10.247
So, you think Ashley made something up
to get back at you.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.082
-Is that what you're saying?
-I don't know.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.375
But she was mad at me,

13:13.460 --> 13:15.627
and she had her reasons
to be, I guess.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.804
How do you explain the blood we found
in the carriage house?

13:31.269 --> 13:32.311
What?

13:33.146 --> 13:35.814
Natalie's blood.
How do you explain it, John?

13:39.694 --> 13:40.736
Really?

13:44.574 --> 13:46.450
It happened there?

13:46.534 --> 13:48.285
Come on, John. Stop bullshitting us.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.204
-You know it fucking happened...
-I don't know!

13:51.831 --> 13:54.458
Okay? It doesn't make
any fucking sense!

13:57.003 --> 14:00.005
Look, I know
I need to get my head right

14:00.882 --> 14:03.050
because what happened
to Natalie and Ann.

14:03.468 --> 14:04.885
But you want me to say it's me.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.180
And you could probably
get away with it.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.100
But you'd be so wrong.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.313
You'd be so fucking wrong.

14:20.610 --> 14:21.693
What do you think?

14:24.113 --> 14:25.447
He gonna crack?

14:25.532 --> 14:28.867
Almost everyone does
if you push them hard enough.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.577
Even if they're innocent.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.664
Well, we'll give him some time
to think about it.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.502
Take another run at him
after his next shitty meal.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.468
Sorry about the Preaker girl.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.136
No need to be sorry.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.015
She got a lot of her mother in her.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.645
Adora's not as dramatic about it,

14:57.647 --> 14:59.565
but that woman loves her attention.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.235
Then scolds you
if you give her too much.

15:07.490 --> 15:10.450
Well, if you listen
to all the talk around here,

15:10.535 --> 15:13.495
everyone's some kind of crazy or evil.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.830
Only half of it's true.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.292
That's what
I'm worried about.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.794
We're looking at the wrong half.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.246
News crew's coming down
from St. Louis today.

15:56.831 --> 16:00.083
Jocelyn says the stubble...
How'd she put it?

16:00.168 --> 16:02.169
"Undermines my authority."

16:02.253 --> 16:04.379
I think she just wants
to spare her chin.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.426
Alan.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.094
Sorry,
this won't take long.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.013
The chief here
is fixing to be on the news.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.476
I guess,
congratulations are in order.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.519
I suppose they are.

16:19.604 --> 16:22.939
Well, I'll just,
come back in a while.

16:23.024 --> 16:26.026
-How's Amma?
-Amma's fine, fine.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.779
- I ran into her roller pals.
- Yeah?

16:28.863 --> 16:32.366
Said she wasn't feeling well. Sick.

16:33.076 --> 16:36.078
Yeah. We've been passing
something around the house.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.080
I hope you don't catch it.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.165
How's that?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.209
You're up there as much as I am.

16:43.670 --> 16:47.130
Why don't you pull up a chair, Alan?
We'll talk this out like men.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.756
Get it out.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.897
Mama?

17:48.192 --> 17:49.693
Well, you're back early.

17:50.570 --> 17:54.489
Clyde was...
Wasn't feeling very well.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.658
Neither is Camille.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.286
She's already finished a bottle,
poor thing.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.708
Don't go overboard.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.127
What?

18:08.045 --> 18:09.671
I only mean...

18:11.132 --> 18:12.924
Let the girls rest.

18:13.009 --> 18:16.595
The body's a miraculous thing.
Let's just let it do its work.

18:16.679 --> 18:17.721
I will.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.391
I'm just helping nature along.

18:25.146 --> 18:26.813
This is your area.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.236
Is there anything you want here?

18:34.363 --> 18:35.405
Whatever.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.381
You took it, didn't you?

18:55.301 --> 18:59.304
It's better if you don't try to stand.
Crawling's okay.

19:00.848 --> 19:04.267
-How do you feel?
-Can you walk?

19:04.769 --> 19:08.146
Yeah, I'm not so bad right now.
She's got you to care for.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.732
I need you to call, um...

19:10.817 --> 19:12.901
No cell. Mama took it.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.487
Then I need you to go get Richard.

19:15.613 --> 19:19.491
-Um, what?
-Go and get him,

19:19.575 --> 19:22.577
and tell him that I need him,
that we need help.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.247
-And if anything...
-Mama.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.873
...happens to me, you tell them

19:26.958 --> 19:29.876
-that Mama took care of me.
-Mama.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.419
You understand?

19:32.797 --> 19:35.423
So you go. And you don't come back.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.176
Go.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.271
What's going on?
You girls better be in bed.

20:00.950 --> 20:04.786
Camille. Camille.

20:07.665 --> 20:11.334
- Darling.
- Mama...

20:11.419 --> 20:14.254
-Camille.
-Mama, am I gonna die?

20:14.338 --> 20:18.133
We're all gonna die, Camille.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.803
Let's get you clean.
You're just covered in sick.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.518
I got you. Hold on.

20:33.357 --> 20:34.941
Feeling better, dear?

20:39.155 --> 20:40.947
Here. Here.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.910
It's not so bad.

20:46.495 --> 20:49.456
-On the mend, I hope.
-Yeah.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.167
Hey, how about that cake?

20:52.627 --> 20:54.586
I could use a piece myself.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.506
If we're gonna have cake,
we should tell Mama.

20:58.591 --> 21:03.470
You go on upstairs to your room,
and I'll bring you your dessert.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.600
This is not the time
to insert yourself,

21:08.684 --> 21:09.851
you understand?

21:12.063 --> 21:13.104
All right.

21:16.025 --> 21:19.569
Sit right here.
Right there, right there...

21:22.073 --> 21:26.034
Check this, one, two.
One, two, three. One, two.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.244
Okay, you ready? Here we go.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.793
You know
I'm gonna be here all night.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.504
- Well, so am I.
- Yeah.

21:38.214 --> 21:41.049
All right. All right.
I have other people to take care of.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.926
You know how to sing, Big City?

22:05.992 --> 22:08.910
Mama, what's in the blue bottle?

22:12.081 --> 22:16.501
I've waited for this for so long,
for you to need me.

22:19.422 --> 22:22.674
Of my three girls,
you're the one most like me.

22:24.927 --> 22:29.180
Marian, she was a...
She was a good girl.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.516
She just...
She needed constant attention.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.976
Stuck to my side.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.102
You killed her.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.151
She was a very sick little girl.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.572
You're delirious.

22:47.950 --> 22:50.618
-She died.
-You burned her.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.249
Well, ashes to ashes, I say.

22:56.333 --> 23:00.712
To even think of you or her
rotting in a box,

23:00.880 --> 23:05.884
things eating away at you?
No, no, no. No, no.

23:09.597 --> 23:10.889
Just tell me.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.223
What?

23:15.019 --> 23:19.064
-Tell me.
-You're asking me to lie.

23:19.148 --> 23:22.358
I can't.
I can't do that, even for you.

23:25.863 --> 23:29.199
My mother,
you never did know her like I did.

23:29.283 --> 23:33.161
Once, Joya woke me
in the dead of night.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.622
I was seven, eight.

23:35.706 --> 23:37.040
She didn't say a word to me.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.417
Just shook me awake,
walked me outside.

23:40.503 --> 23:42.295
Barefoot, in my nightgown.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.089
I knew better

23:44.173 --> 23:47.634
than to open my mouth
when Joya was punishing me.

23:48.969 --> 23:52.013
It was the same whether
I'd done something wrong or not.

23:53.224 --> 23:55.141
She drove me to the woods,

23:56.602 --> 23:57.936
walked me in deep,

23:59.355 --> 24:02.273
sat me down and left me.

24:06.028 --> 24:08.196
Took me hours to get home.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.323
When I finally made it,
I walked in that door,

24:10.407 --> 24:11.449
and my mother said,

24:13.160 --> 24:14.202
"You're home."

24:16.122 --> 24:17.413
I believe if you had asked her

24:17.498 --> 24:20.125
she would have said
what she was doing was right.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.377
We all have bad childhoods.

24:22.461 --> 24:26.214
At some point,
you have to forget it, move on.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.716
Anything else is just selfish.

24:30.678 --> 24:31.928
Time for more medicine.

24:42.064 --> 24:45.275
I don't want any more. I can't.

24:45.359 --> 24:46.776
It's good for you.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.700
Here. Take just a little more.
Right here.

24:54.827 --> 24:55.952
I'll be right back.

24:59.081 --> 25:01.708
It's okay.

25:45.419 --> 25:49.088
Hello? Hello?

25:50.633 --> 25:53.051
Hello?

25:54.220 --> 25:57.013
Hello? Hello...

26:00.267 --> 26:02.060
-Evening, Detective.
-Good evening.

26:02.144 --> 26:05.313
I didn't hear you right off.
I apologize.

26:06.357 --> 26:07.732
Is Camille available?

26:08.484 --> 26:10.151
Not at the moment, no.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.111
She's out with those
girlfriends of hers.

26:14.782 --> 26:17.075
Help me.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.999
-Tell her I stopped by?
-I certainly will.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.043
You have a good evening, Detective.

27:16.969 --> 27:20.555
Amma, you said you were gonna go.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.101
I'm sorry.

27:28.105 --> 27:31.024
I need to stay her good girl.

27:32.401 --> 27:34.944
I need to stay her good girl.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.088
Preaker. Leave a message.

28:41.804 --> 28:43.054
Preaker. Leave a...

29:46.618 --> 29:47.660
Mama.

29:50.914 --> 29:54.000
Alan! Alan!

29:55.085 --> 29:57.211
Alan!

29:58.297 --> 29:59.464
Alan!

30:48.388 --> 30:51.641
Camille. Camille. Camille.
Talk to me.

30:51.767 --> 30:54.143
Camille. Camille, look at me.
Look at me.

30:54.228 --> 30:57.104
We need an ambulance in here now!
Get one up here now!

30:57.689 --> 31:00.024
- Camille!
- Get Amma.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.359
Get Amma.

31:02.569 --> 31:05.363
Shh. It's okay, honey.

31:05.447 --> 31:06.614
Amma.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.449
It's gonna be okay, kiddo.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.079
It's all right.

31:15.999 --> 31:20.836
Get you home. Home. Home. Home.

31:22.422 --> 31:25.633
Yeah. Home. You're okay.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.302
- Amma!
- You're okay now.

31:33.100 --> 31:36.185
What were you told
to warrant this kind of a violation?

31:36.270 --> 31:38.604
You know me. You know who I am.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.356
My God!

31:40.774 --> 31:43.109
You know how sorry I am
it has to be this way,

31:43.193 --> 31:44.402
but we have reason to believe...

31:44.486 --> 31:47.613
No. Get...
Alan, get Glen Morgan on the phone.

31:47.739 --> 31:48.906
- Yeah, all right.
- He's our lawyer.

31:48.991 --> 31:50.032
I won't have this.

31:50.117 --> 31:52.577
I don't... I don't care
what Camille told you.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.537
- She is mentally ill.
- Detective?

31:54.621 --> 31:56.080
Do you understand?

31:56.248 --> 31:58.040
What do you got?

32:06.842 --> 32:08.968
- Do you understand?
- Adora, that's not the point.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.803
She's mentally ill.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.138
Mrs. Crellin, you're gonna need

32:12.222 --> 32:13.514
to come down to the station with me.

32:13.599 --> 32:14.640
What?

32:15.434 --> 32:17.393
Adora, put your hands
behind your back.

32:18.353 --> 32:20.688
Adora, you have to do
what he says. Now.

32:20.772 --> 32:21.897
No, no, no. No, I can't. I can't.

32:21.982 --> 32:23.733
They're trying to make this
as respectful as possible.

32:23.817 --> 32:25.610
-Put your hands behind your back.
-No, no, no, no.

32:25.694 --> 32:26.902
You have the right
to remain silent.

32:26.987 --> 32:28.029
Detective, is that necessary?

32:28.113 --> 32:30.197
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford an...

32:30.282 --> 32:31.365
Call me
as soon as you get there.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.951
Do you understand
your rights, Mrs. Crellin?

32:35.037 --> 32:37.538
- Come up. Please, gentlemen, hurry.
- Yes, sir.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.833
Can you see that? Can you see it?

32:40.917 --> 32:42.460
Eyes are PEARL.

32:43.170 --> 32:44.795
- Can you see it?
- She gonna be okay?

32:45.047 --> 32:46.505
Yeah. Eyes are PEARL, too.

32:46.590 --> 32:47.632
- Good girl.
- Yeah.

32:47.716 --> 32:51.135
- Can you walk? Come on.
- Yeah.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.721
- Good, good, good. Okay.
- I'm walking out of here.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.139
Take it easy.
Take it easy, now.

32:55.766 --> 32:57.808
- It's gonna be all right.
- Please don't.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.273
- Check 'em.
- I got you.

33:04.775 --> 33:07.777
- Amma!
- Mama! Mama!

33:07.861 --> 33:10.112
- Amma!
- Mama!

33:10.572 --> 33:11.822
Mama!

33:36.473 --> 33:38.766
I'm bleeding as fast as I can.

33:42.604 --> 33:45.439
We found the pliers
that match the marks

33:45.524 --> 33:46.857
on Ann and Natalie's gums,

33:47.401 --> 33:50.945
so we're expecting to charge
your mom on the girls, too.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.240
She pulled the teeth alone?

33:54.324 --> 33:56.492
She might have had
an accomplice, maybe Alan.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.077
We'll investigate.

34:03.291 --> 34:04.583
And what about Marian?

34:06.753 --> 34:10.297
We're hopeful that the levels
from you two will help us.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.050
Thank you.

34:16.930 --> 34:19.557
Usually Munchausen Moms, they...

34:20.851 --> 34:23.728
They tend to use the same poisons
once they find one they like.

34:24.354 --> 34:27.273
We found a collection of medicine
Adora was hoarding.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.693
Antifreeze, prescriptions.

34:32.863 --> 34:34.155
Rat poison.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.200
Amma built up a tolerance
for it over the years.

34:38.285 --> 34:39.952
That's what the doctors think.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.539
But, not you, so...

34:43.623 --> 34:45.166
Christ.

34:51.173 --> 34:53.174
You have a good friend in your boss.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.844
Vickery didn't want
to hear it from me,

34:56.928 --> 35:01.432
but, Curry nearly busted
the station door down.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.480
I'm sorry for your...

35:13.528 --> 35:15.488
I'm sorry, Camille.

35:17.866 --> 35:18.908
For everything.

35:21.369 --> 35:22.745
Yeah. Me, too.

35:24.915 --> 35:25.956
I'm sorry.

35:33.673 --> 35:34.924
What a dick.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.567
How do you plead?

36:37.612 --> 36:38.946
Not guilty.

38:22.634 --> 38:23.676
Well, look here.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.136
I wasn't expecting
to see you beauties.

38:27.097 --> 38:29.473
Don't you just look beautiful?

38:31.017 --> 38:33.477
Did you get
the housewarming card I sent you?

38:35.563 --> 38:36.605
Okay.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.526
I know your place
isn't new to Camille,

38:40.610 --> 38:42.194
but it is new to you.

38:42.946 --> 38:44.238
It's a new lease.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.117
You know, I might just come up
to St. Louis one day

38:48.243 --> 38:49.785
for a visit.

38:49.869 --> 38:51.245
Yeah, you should do that.

38:54.082 --> 38:56.625
Do not let that witch
come to St. Louis.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.837
She tries. She's just not happy.

38:59.921 --> 39:03.924
Not happy? She's a pig in shit
now that Mama's out of the way.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.470
"Men get to be warrior poets.

39:08.555 --> 39:12.391
"What woman is described that way?
Not Adora.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.561
"Prosecution says
my mother is a warrior martyr.

39:15.645 --> 39:17.146
"If she was guilty, they argued,

39:17.230 --> 39:20.149
"it was only of a very female
sort of rage.

39:20.233 --> 39:23.068
"Overcare. Killing through kindness.

39:23.778 --> 39:24.820
"It shouldn't have surprised me

39:24.946 --> 39:28.407
"that Adora fell on that sword
spectacularly.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.743
"Of course,
she never did explain the teeth

39:30.827 --> 39:32.953
"or that kind of naked rage a person,

39:33.079 --> 39:35.831
"man or woman,
would need to do something like that.

39:35.915 --> 39:36.957
"It didn't fit.

39:37.042 --> 39:40.461
"So, as with everything
in my mother's world, it didn't exist,

39:40.545 --> 39:43.047
"except perhaps in some dark place
only she knows about.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.716
"My mother has many years
to consider what she's done.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.468
"As for me,

39:47.552 --> 39:50.804
"I've forgiven myself
for failing to save my sister

39:51.848 --> 39:54.349
"and given myself over
to raising the other.

39:54.809 --> 39:57.936
"Am I good at caring for Amma
because of kindness,

39:58.021 --> 40:01.482
"or do I like caring for Amma
because I have Adora's sickness?

40:01.608 --> 40:03.984
"I waver between the two.

40:04.861 --> 40:08.822
"Especially at night,
when my skin begins to pulse.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.117
"Lately, I've been...

40:14.496 --> 40:16.622
"Leaning toward kindness."

40:23.963 --> 40:25.214
Come on, what do you think?

40:25.298 --> 40:28.258
Can't a person
be quiet for a second, or...

40:36.518 --> 40:38.143
It's beautiful, Cubby.

40:41.314 --> 40:45.442
Really beautiful.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.951
So, just file it?

40:57.122 --> 40:58.163
File it.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.793
Um...

41:04.003 --> 41:08.674
You noticed I finally stopped
asking if you were fine?

41:08.800 --> 41:10.717
You noticed
I started asking if you were?

41:10.844 --> 41:12.219
Yeah. It's annoying.

41:12.762 --> 41:15.347
-Are you?
-Doing better. Stop it.

41:15.431 --> 41:18.100
I owe you. You and Eileen, I do.

41:18.476 --> 41:21.103
If you...
If you ever need anything...

41:21.187 --> 41:23.605
You certainly do not owe us.

41:25.066 --> 41:26.567
Worrying about you was the only thing

41:26.651 --> 41:28.694
that kept the missus
from nursing me to death.

41:34.033 --> 41:36.034
She seems like
she's gonna be just fine.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.745
And I like her friend.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.582
She might actually be
a good influence on her.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.836
Amma's, I don't know.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.172
She doesn't sleep most nights
unless I'm with her.

41:50.425 --> 41:52.968
-She misses Adora.
-What a thing.

41:53.595 --> 41:56.763
Even when you win
the fucked-up family Olympics...

41:57.765 --> 42:00.517
Okay, guys, time to eat now.

42:04.147 --> 42:05.189
It's about damn time!

42:05.732 --> 42:08.609
So, it turns out that
the mayor didn't want me to know

42:08.693 --> 42:11.445
because the new head of Parks and Rec

42:11.529 --> 42:12.613
was his appointment

42:12.697 --> 42:15.866
and his mistress.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.952
And that, I believe,
has nothing to do with,

42:19.078 --> 42:21.788
Mae, your question about
why the public pool closed.

42:21.873 --> 42:24.875
But it was a good story. Juicy.

42:25.335 --> 42:29.630
My husband will take the long route
to avoid a simple "I don't know."

42:32.800 --> 42:34.718
I like your editorials,
Mr. Curry.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.720
They make good points,
and they're not boring.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.722
You read the editorials?

42:38.806 --> 42:41.767
Call me Frank. I like this girl.

42:41.851 --> 42:44.937
I'm thinking about going into
either politics or journalism.

42:45.063 --> 42:47.397
You just say that to impress Camille.

42:47.482 --> 42:50.609
- I do not.
- Kiss-ass.

42:51.402 --> 42:53.278
I don't know what
I want to do yet, exactly.

42:53.363 --> 42:55.322
- We have a lot of time, right?
- Absolutely.

42:55.406 --> 42:58.492
Well, I'm gonna be
an on-camera personality.

42:58.576 --> 43:01.245
I have the gift of gab, that's what...

43:01.329 --> 43:02.829
That's what people say.

43:02.914 --> 43:05.958
Well, that's interesting.
How does one get into that field?

43:06.042 --> 43:08.418
Well, you start with the gift of gab.

43:08.503 --> 43:12.547
Then you go to college,
and Communications major.

43:12.632 --> 43:14.299
Again, he has no idea.

43:14.384 --> 43:15.968
I have no idea.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.804
Let's just get you
through high school first?

43:38.241 --> 43:40.659
Do you wish I was a writer like you?

43:42.954 --> 43:45.163
All I wish is for you to be happy.

43:47.292 --> 43:49.209
You make me happy.

43:50.545 --> 43:51.878
I could eat you up.

43:55.717 --> 43:57.592
Okay.

43:58.428 --> 43:59.886
All right, good night.

43:59.971 --> 44:01.013
G'night.

44:25.204 --> 44:28.165
Sorry to bother you,
but have you seen Mae?

44:28.249 --> 44:30.917
I think that she and Amma
went to the park

44:31.002 --> 44:34.629
to not swim in the closed pool,
but, they should be back soon.

44:36.966 --> 44:39.134
Did Amma talk to you?

44:40.887 --> 44:43.638
I think the girls had
their first little fight.

44:43.723 --> 44:45.349
-Over what?
-Who knows?

44:45.433 --> 44:46.850
A boy, nail polish,

44:46.934 --> 44:48.226
-girl stuff.
-Yeah.

44:48.311 --> 44:51.313
I envy the skin, but nothing else
about that age, you know?

44:51.397 --> 44:55.942
Yeah. Well, um, when they get back,
I'll send her your way, all right?

44:56.027 --> 44:58.445
-Thanks, hon.
-All right, no problem. Bye.

47:08.075 --> 47:09.618
Don't tell Mama.
