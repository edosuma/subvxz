WEBVTT

00:22.433 --> 00:24.822
Did I wake you?

00:26.153 --> 00:28.621
Thank God you're alive.

00:36.113 --> 00:38.866
I've been wanting to do this for months.

00:38.953 --> 00:42.263
See they don't let you do your nails
up in Manticore either.

00:42.353 --> 00:46.107
No respect for the girlie arts,
that place. I had to torch it.

00:46.193 --> 00:48.343
No doubt.

00:48.433 --> 00:53.109
So Manticore and 'em got all irate,
cos Eyes Only put salt in their game?

00:53.473 --> 00:56.271
And they sent you to take the brother out?

00:56.353 --> 00:59.823
But instead you burned the place up
and let everybody out.

00:59.913 --> 01:02.711
- Needed some get-back.
- Right.

01:04.233 --> 01:08.431
So what's with this virus they put in you
so that you and Logan can't touch?

01:08.513 --> 01:12.222
- They're just mean like that.
- No, boo.

01:12.313 --> 01:16.067
I think they sent you to kill Logan
cos he's Eyes Only.

01:16.153 --> 01:20.271
- Logan? Please.
- Straight up. Now it all makes sense.

01:20.353 --> 01:23.550
- You two were always doin' stuff on the DL.
- You got it all wrong.

01:23.633 --> 01:25.908
Sugar, don't front.

01:25.993 --> 01:29.349
You been creepin' with Eyes Only.

01:30.113 --> 01:34.311
- Gimme some.
- You can't say anything though.

01:34.393 --> 01:36.907
I already forgot.
You got Original Cindy's word.

01:36.993 --> 01:39.507
Many people want him dead.
I almost got him killed.

01:39.593 --> 01:41.823
It's going to be aiight. It's all good.

01:43.153 --> 01:46.862
It doesn't feel all good.
It doesn't even feel a little bit good.

01:47.433 --> 01:52.826
Somehow, someway,
it's all gonna come correct.

01:52.913 --> 01:56.701
Cos you and Logan just got it like that.
Nothing can keep you two apart.

01:56.873 --> 02:02.470
You're home, you're safe, you're strong.
You kicked Manticore to the curb for good.

02:03.393 --> 02:05.384
They can't hurt you any more.

02:06.193 --> 02:08.707
They can't hurt anyone any more.

02:14.873 --> 02:20.709
We need to keep movin'. If Manticore's under
attack, they'll be lookin' for us to remobilise.

02:25.073 --> 02:28.952
Right there. There it is.
The rendezvous signal.

02:35.073 --> 02:37.951
- I don't know about this.
- We're supposed to regroup.

02:38.033 --> 02:41.264
But the other night, the fire...
No one let us out of the barracks.

02:41.353 --> 02:45.551
Maybe they were busy defending the facility.
Manticore was under attack.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.591
Command is someplace
or there wouldn't have been a signal.

02:48.673 --> 02:52.746
- But the TACs were shooting at us.
- They were protecting the perimeter.

02:52.833 --> 02:55.825
Sure, we took some friendly fire, that's all.

02:55.913 --> 02:58.905
Come on. We've still got ten clicks to cover.

03:08.673 --> 03:11.506
There they are. We're goin' home.

03:20.153 --> 03:22.906
X6-314 reporting for duty, sir.

03:25.553 --> 03:28.021
At ease, soldier.

03:40.273 --> 03:44.903
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

03:44.993 --> 03:46.984
Then she escaped.

03:47.073 --> 03:51.385
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

03:51.473 --> 03:53.828
she is haunted by her past.

03:53.913 --> 03:58.907
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

04:38.713 --> 04:43.867
Police suspect foul play in a fire
that claimed as many as 100 lives last Friday.

04:46.193 --> 04:51.062
Authorities won't release information
on the fire's origin and any loss of life.

04:51.153 --> 04:55.305
We can't even get music in this damn place.
Why can't we just go back to LA?

04:55.393 --> 04:59.147
Because LA is full of freaks
and weirdos and psychos.

04:59.233 --> 05:01.224
Look out!

05:22.833 --> 05:25.506
- What are you doing?
- Goin' back to LA.

06:30.233 --> 06:32.349
So, what should I tell everybody?

06:32.433 --> 06:36.711
Let a sister handle this. Original Cindy's
gonna get out in front of this thing.

06:36.793 --> 06:40.263
Hey, everybody!
Look who's back from the dead.

06:40.633 --> 06:43.193
All right.

06:43.273 --> 06:45.707
Max. Almost scared me to death.

06:46.673 --> 06:50.302
This is a joyous turn of events.
Now, what happened?

06:50.713 --> 06:53.671
Well, well. Look who's here.

06:53.753 --> 06:58.383
What can I say, Normal? Rumours
of my death had been greatly exaggerated.

06:58.473 --> 07:00.668
- Hot run - Everclear.
- Got my name on it.

07:00.753 --> 07:03.221
No, your name is mud, missy-miss.

07:03.313 --> 07:05.622
I've heard some lame excuses
for missing work,

07:05.713 --> 07:08.989
but faking your own death
for a three-month sabbatical is a new low.

07:09.073 --> 07:12.782
I did not fake my own death.
I had a medical emergency.

07:12.873 --> 07:15.945
- Would you care to explicate?
- A heart transplant.

07:18.473 --> 07:20.543
That's good.

07:20.633 --> 07:24.546
Have you got a note from your doctor or
a prescription for cyclosporine perhaps?

07:24.633 --> 07:27.386
Because I'll need
some more proof before I buy that...

07:34.273 --> 07:37.549
That's a nice big scar you got there.

07:37.833 --> 07:41.269
Well, enjoy it while you can,
cos it's fading fast.

07:41.353 --> 07:43.583
- Can I use your phone?
- What about the package?

07:43.673 --> 07:46.790
- I'll get to it.
- It's like she never left.

07:50.153 --> 07:52.986
Me, hittin' you back. What's up?

07:53.073 --> 07:56.509
Embers cool and the death toll rises
after Monday's tragic blaze

07:56.593 --> 08:00.632
- at Mountainside Veterans Hospital.
- Have you seen this on Channel Three?

08:01.033 --> 08:04.025
Sketch, hook me up on three.

08:04.113 --> 08:07.469
Channel Three News has learned
the inferno was the result of arson,

08:07.553 --> 08:10.113
traced to rogue terrorist group S1W.

08:10.193 --> 08:14.345
- Manticore.
- Only they're blaming S1W.

08:14.433 --> 08:16.583
Is that a bad thing?
And what's the S1W?

08:16.673 --> 08:19.585
It's a progressive group
fighting the good fight.

08:19.673 --> 08:23.461
They're into direct action,
so the government paints them as terrorists.

08:23.553 --> 08:28.263
Better people think some crackpots
torched the VA than the freaks got out.

08:29.313 --> 08:33.022
The S1W held hostages
in a VA facility last month.

08:33.113 --> 08:37.390
This is so bogus. Eyes Only said that
hospital's a front for that Manticore place.

08:37.472 --> 08:39.748
Mountainside burst into flames...

08:39.832 --> 08:44.065
They claim a lot of people died in that fire.
The S1W is being framed for murder.

08:44.153 --> 08:48.749
Nothin' I can do about it. And why do you
care so much about this S1-whatever?

08:48.833 --> 08:53.224
Some friends of mine are involved.
Done stuff for Eyes Only.

08:53.313 --> 08:58.182
Forget I mentioned it. It's my problem.
Can you come over later?

08:58.273 --> 09:00.707
Given the givens,
I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

09:00.793 --> 09:02.590
It'll be OK.

09:02.673 --> 09:05.665
Just come. I've got some information for you,

09:06.753 --> 09:10.462
I'm still putting it together,
but it could be important.

09:10.553 --> 09:13.067
I'll swing by.

09:17.713 --> 09:20.386
The death toll is expected to rise.

09:20.473 --> 09:25.149
Mutants on the loose.
The genetically superior walk among us.

09:25.233 --> 09:28.270
They said that everybody died, fool.

09:28.353 --> 09:31.743
We thought Max was dead too,
and yet here she is, good as new.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.426
Gotta jet.

09:37.193 --> 09:41.664
- Gotta make Eyes Only get the truth out.
- I can't make him do anything.

09:41.753 --> 09:43.393
They're pinning this on us
cos of the job we pulled at the VA office.

09:43.393 --> 09:45.224
They're pinning this on us
cos of the job we pulled at the VA office.

09:45.313 --> 09:48.783
That was a favour to you.
Now I need a favour.

09:50.193 --> 09:51.911
Talk to him.

10:11.113 --> 10:13.673
This is so cool.

10:13.753 --> 10:15.948
Does it say how much you cost?

10:17.113 --> 10:19.502
A lot more than you, sweetheart.

10:21.713 --> 10:25.706
- Is it a gang thing?
- Now you guessed my secret.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.830
So how come you're not out
gangbanging, then?

10:28.913 --> 10:31.791
Sometimes a guy can have
a lot more fun on his own.

10:32.473 --> 10:37.069
- So you're on the lam.
- You're so intuitive.

10:38.753 --> 10:42.712
Why don't you go grab us
something to eat? Will ya?

10:42.793 --> 10:44.784
OK.

11:17.713 --> 11:20.466
- I'm starving.
- Me too.

11:21.993 --> 11:25.303
If I don't get something to eat soon,
I'm gonna kill somebody.

11:25.393 --> 11:28.749
They're not gonna give us food -
not without money.

11:31.353 --> 11:33.344
I'm goin' in.

11:55.273 --> 11:57.992
A bar code? What does it mean?

11:58.073 --> 12:00.064
Means it's ours.

12:07.193 --> 12:09.423
Where'd you guys get those?

12:09.513 --> 12:11.981
My friend has one just like that.

12:14.273 --> 12:16.264
That's it. Let's go.

12:24.913 --> 12:26.949
Hold it. I said, hold it!

12:32.793 --> 12:35.944
Get the money! Do it!

12:47.073 --> 12:49.353
Great. That's just great.

12:49.353 --> 12:50.502
Great. That's just great.

13:02.913 --> 13:05.746
Possible sighting Echo Golf 4-2-7-8.

13:05.833 --> 13:08.586
- How many?
- Six or seven.

13:08.673 --> 13:10.982
All right, send a unit to check it out.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.391
White.

13:15.713 --> 13:18.273
Handle it. We don't want
local law enforcement.

13:18.353 --> 13:21.151
The idea is to keep this mess under wraps.

13:22.513 --> 13:27.587
Well, tell them they can shove their
jurisdiction, that this is a federal matter.

13:28.513 --> 13:30.504
Tally on the signalling operation.

13:30.593 --> 13:33.312
38 showed up at
the rendezvous point over the day.

13:33.393 --> 13:37.591
Not bad. Keep the signal running
every night till they stop coming.

13:40.513 --> 13:42.504
Sir.

13:45.953 --> 13:48.751
- What is that?
- Something made to fight in the desert.

13:48.833 --> 13:51.188
Skin's designed to retain moisture.

13:51.273 --> 13:56.427
Even has a second eyelid, probably
to protect the cornea against sand and grit.

13:56.513 --> 13:59.789
I hate to think how many of those
rolled off the assembly line.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.023
- They bring it in?
- X7s, sir.

14:02.113 --> 14:05.822
- Manticore uses them to guard the perimeter.
- I read the reports.

14:05.913 --> 14:08.302
They've got some kinda
hive-mind thing goin'.

14:08.393 --> 14:12.625
- Communicate ultrasonically, in digital code.
- Ship it out in the next transport.

14:12.713 --> 14:15.432
I want Forensics to take it apart for analysis.

14:23.433 --> 14:25.628
Get it outta here. Them too.

14:25.713 --> 14:27.704
Get it out!

14:40.913 --> 14:42.904
It's about time.

15:24.153 --> 15:27.270
Share your rations. Slow down.

15:27.353 --> 15:29.583
Daddy's home.

15:29.673 --> 15:32.267
- X6-787, sir.
- X6-809, sir.

15:32.353 --> 15:34.628
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

15:34.713 --> 15:38.262
What are you bozos thinkin' -
knockin' over a quickie mart?

15:38.353 --> 15:41.902
- Sir?
- I had a very sweet deal goin' and you blew it.

15:43.433 --> 15:46.345
- What's that doin' here?
- He escaped the attack with us.

15:46.433 --> 15:48.549
- The attack?
- On Manticore.

15:48.633 --> 15:51.545
Command's re-established.
We saw the signal to regroup.

15:51.633 --> 15:54.511
The rendezvous is six clicks from here,
south-southwest.

15:54.593 --> 15:57.061
- We were about to move out.
- I hate to say this,

15:57.153 --> 15:59.667
but Manticore was not attacked.

15:59.753 --> 16:01.744
They tried to barbecue us.

16:01.833 --> 16:03.551
Sir?

16:03.633 --> 16:07.592
They're trying to kill us.
The signal's bogus. It's a trap.

16:07.673 --> 16:10.471
If I may, sir, that doesn't make any sense.

16:10.833 --> 16:14.621
We're valuable military assets,
representing billions of dollars in R&D.

16:14.713 --> 16:18.592
- Why would Manticore try to get rid of us?
- I want to get rid of ya, and I just met ya.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.231
We should go. They're waiting.

16:20.393 --> 16:24.227
What part of "They're trying to kill you"
did you not understand?

16:24.313 --> 16:29.865
Sir, officers of rank superior to yours left
orders to regroup when instructed to do so.

16:29.953 --> 16:33.229
Far be it from me to violate
the chain of command.

16:34.233 --> 16:37.509
- Fall in.
- You're really gonna do this?

16:38.793 --> 16:43.230
- Didn't you hear me, soldier?
- He heard you. He just can't believe his ears.

16:43.313 --> 16:46.111
I'm gonna have to report you. Both of you.

16:46.793 --> 16:48.863
You do that.

16:48.953 --> 16:51.592
Left face. Quick march.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.144
Hey.

17:02.673 --> 17:06.029
- Hey.
- You said you had something for me.

17:06.913 --> 17:10.189
Yeah. Come see.

17:10.272 --> 17:12.582
We shouldn't get too close. The virus.

17:15.272 --> 17:19.471
Apparently there's a massive military action
in the woods around Manticore.

17:19.553 --> 17:23.387
Same thing happened in '09. By the time
they got their act together, we'd gone.

17:23.473 --> 17:27.307
There's a difference.
You escaped because you wanted out.

17:27.792 --> 17:32.230
They ran for their lives. They may not
even realise Manticore wanted them dead.

17:33.033 --> 17:35.024
This mean anything to you?

17:36.633 --> 17:40.467
Got it from an informant lives out that way.
Real conspiracy buff.

17:40.553 --> 17:44.751
- Obsessed with UFOs.
- It's a signal from Manticore.

17:44.833 --> 17:48.143
We were trained to look for it
in case the facility was compromised.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.031
- What does it say?
- Regroup.

17:51.113 --> 17:55.231
Echo Golf 4-2-7-9-5-2. Friday. Today.

17:55.313 --> 17:59.431
- Whoa, whoa. Where are you goin'?
- Logan, they tried to kill them.

17:59.513 --> 18:04.507
- Now they want to finish the job.
- They could be shipping 'em to a new facility.

18:04.593 --> 18:07.391
- See? That doesn't work for me either.
- Fine.

18:07.473 --> 18:10.271
You wanna go out and save the day,
what's the plan?

18:10.353 --> 18:11.752
- Don't know yet.
- Max.

18:11.833 --> 18:15.906
This is happening because of me.
I forced them to go. That's my family.

18:16.553 --> 18:21.673
Some are screwed up. Some don't look like
anything anybody has ever seen before.

18:23.593 --> 18:25.823
But I'm responsible for them just the same.

18:29.553 --> 18:30.986
Careful.

18:31.993 --> 18:34.985
Now, see, you took the word
right outta my mouth.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.663
Run!

19:46.633 --> 19:48.624
Weird kid.

19:50.233 --> 19:53.748
Want some hydrogenated,
imitation-pork product?

19:55.193 --> 19:57.184
All right. More for me.

19:58.873 --> 20:03.025
- Sir, you were right. It was an ambush.
- They shot at us.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.989
If you idiots let them follow you...

20:08.193 --> 20:10.468
- Great.
- Is it them?

20:11.353 --> 20:13.344
I wish.

20:14.313 --> 20:16.827
Give me something to tie his leg off with.

20:18.553 --> 20:21.704
- What are you doing here?
- Was about to ask you the same thing.

20:21.793 --> 20:25.263
I'd kick your ass, but we don't
have time for that right now.

20:25.353 --> 20:27.708
The bullet went through.
We must cauterise.

20:27.793 --> 20:30.671
- Why were they shooting at us?
- He's going into shock.

20:30.753 --> 20:34.109
- Get something to keep him warm.
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

20:34.273 --> 20:36.548
Bet that one flunked Field Med.

20:39.153 --> 20:42.543
- Go.
- I won't lie. This is gonna hurt like hell.

20:48.513 --> 20:50.504
Hang on, hang on.

20:51.193 --> 20:53.309
It's almost over.

20:54.313 --> 20:57.942
OK, it's done. You're gonna be OK.

20:58.993 --> 21:00.353
Yeah, so long as we get him
and the rest of these kids outta here.

21:00.353 --> 21:02.105
Yeah, so long as we get him
and the rest of these kids outta here.

21:02.193 --> 21:05.151
What do you mean "we"?
This is your party, not mine.

21:07.673 --> 21:09.664
Help me to understand

21:09.753 --> 21:14.827
how a girl on a motorcycle
got the drop on you and all of your men.

21:14.913 --> 21:18.110
It's hard to explain, sir.
It all happened so fast.

21:18.193 --> 21:22.186
Sorry. I thought you'd want to see this.
It was retrieved from the Manticore site.

21:22.273 --> 21:25.026
- Belonged to Director Renfro.
- On the desk.

21:31.913 --> 21:34.632
A database. Good.

21:37.633 --> 21:40.022
- Well, well.
- What is it, sir?

21:40.393 --> 21:43.066
The DNA workup of an X5.

21:43.153 --> 21:45.508
Not bad-Iookin' for a freak.

21:45.833 --> 21:48.905
Sir, that's her.
That's the girl on the motorcycle.

21:48.993 --> 21:51.791
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.

21:53.193 --> 21:55.582
Don't just stand there. Find her.

22:33.433 --> 22:36.425
All right, people, fall in.

22:37.033 --> 22:40.787
There's been a change in your mission status
- extreme and unforeseen.

22:40.873 --> 22:43.512
You've been betrayed by your command.
What do you do?

22:43.593 --> 22:46.630
- Redeploy.
- Correct. How?

22:46.713 --> 22:49.671
We have no training
with regard to that circumstance.

22:49.753 --> 22:51.744
- Do you know what that means?
- No, ma'am.

22:51.833 --> 22:54.347
All your training goes out the window.

22:54.433 --> 22:57.266
Starting with your blind
obedience to Manticore.

22:57.353 --> 22:59.992
- Yes, ma'am.
- Which means, stop calling me ma'am,

23:00.073 --> 23:02.382
- and start calling me Max.
- Yes, ma'am.

23:02.473 --> 23:05.112
Yes, Max. That's my name.

23:05.193 --> 23:08.390
And now you're in the real world,
you all should have names too.

23:08.473 --> 23:10.987
- For the love of...
- Shut up.

23:11.913 --> 23:16.065
You must stop thinking of yourselves
as soldiers and think of yourselves as people.

23:16.153 --> 23:16.393
- But we are soldiers.
- You mouthin' off to me?

23:16.393 --> 23:19.226
- But we are soldiers.
- You mouthin' off to me?

23:19.313 --> 23:21.668
Because I've zero tolerance for that. Zero.

23:21.753 --> 23:26.429
And to commemorate this special moment,
that's gonna be your name. Zero.

23:26.953 --> 23:29.148
Get out on sentry duty.

23:32.473 --> 23:36.751
- Saw you messin' around with that radio.
- I excelled in Diagnostics and Repair.

23:36.833 --> 23:40.382
- I was trying to fix it.
- Fixit. That's gonna be your name.

23:40.473 --> 23:45.593
And that's what you're gonna do with
that ol' pick-up over there. Fix it.

23:50.593 --> 23:52.584
You're the girl that threw up?

23:52.673 --> 23:54.982
You could always call her Ralph.

23:55.073 --> 23:57.746
Ralph. I like it.

23:57.833 --> 24:00.427
- It's a boy's name.
- I still like it.

24:01.113 --> 24:04.105
Ralph it is, then. Go check on Bullet.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.991
- Who's Bullet?
- The kid that got shot.

24:13.033 --> 24:15.911
- That yours?
- I'm in the bugle corps.

24:15.993 --> 24:18.143
Bugler it is.

24:18.233 --> 24:21.145
- What's my assignment?
- Getting some sleep.

24:21.553 --> 24:24.511
- It's not lights out yet.
- It's OK.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.629
Let's find a place for you to bunk down.

24:26.713 --> 24:29.307
What about him?
Doesn't he need a name?

24:29.953 --> 24:34.390
I'll leave that to you, since you two
seem to be getting along so well.

24:44.153 --> 24:46.542
- Where's White?
- Sir, this is a restricted area.

24:46.633 --> 24:49.272
Tell him Lydecker's here to see him.

24:49.353 --> 24:52.709
- I'll have to ask you to wait here a moment.
- Sorry. This is urgent.

24:52.793 --> 24:56.263
Command, there's someone here
from Manticore. Name's Lydecker.

25:15.353 --> 25:18.709
He identified himself?
What the hell was he thinking?

25:32.593 --> 25:34.584
Damn it!

25:38.593 --> 25:41.346
- Hello.
- It's Lydecker.

25:42.153 --> 25:45.463
- How did you get this number?
- Never mind that.

25:45.553 --> 25:48.067
I need you to help me
get in touch with Max.

25:48.153 --> 25:51.748
- What for?
- I can't tell you that.

25:51.833 --> 25:54.301
Do you know where she is?

25:56.633 --> 26:00.069
- Somewhere in the woods outside Manticore.
- He'll be lookin' for her.

26:00.153 --> 26:03.270
- He? Who's he?
- If you hear from her,

26:04.633 --> 26:08.672
tell her to get outta there as fast as she can.

26:19.153 --> 26:21.223
Satellite's in range, sir.

27:29.193 --> 27:33.505
- Try to take your weight off it.
- I'm fine, Ralph. Would you cut it out?

27:40.153 --> 27:43.225
X8-621 is ready
to commence training, ma'am.

27:44.913 --> 27:49.589
Your name's Bugler, remember?
And there's not gonna be any training today.

27:50.033 --> 27:52.263
- There's not?
- No. Not ever again.

27:52.953 --> 27:54.909
Really?

27:54.993 --> 27:58.622
Really. See, you don't have to take orders
any more. Not from anyone.

27:59.033 --> 28:02.105
- Not even you?
- Especially not from me.

28:03.153 --> 28:06.623
Well, when the goin' gets cute,
the tough get goin'.

28:06.713 --> 28:08.669
You're really leaving?

28:10.593 --> 28:12.823
Afraid so.

28:12.913 --> 28:18.431
Figures you'd forget the one good thing
they taught us: "Never abandon your unit."

28:24.193 --> 28:26.912
Well, thanks to you,
there is no more Manticore.

28:28.353 --> 28:30.742
You made this mess.

28:30.833 --> 28:32.824
Not me.

28:36.233 --> 28:38.986
Are you sure this girl was with 'em?

28:39.073 --> 28:42.543
See for yourself.
Let me position the mike.

28:43.513 --> 28:45.708
They're downloading.

28:47.873 --> 28:52.071
The computer's translating the ultrasound
signals, reconstructing a sonic image

28:52.153 --> 28:54.826
relayed to them by the X7 inside.

28:56.353 --> 28:59.345
Now we convert the sonic image
into a visual one.

29:01.673 --> 29:04.028
Let me see if I can enhance it.

29:08.393 --> 29:10.753
- That's pretty much what she looks like.
- That's her.

29:10.753 --> 29:12.072
- That's pretty much what she looks like.
- That's her.

29:12.153 --> 29:13.950
Take her alive if you can.

29:16.793 --> 29:18.784
OK, Zero, hit it.

29:19.953 --> 29:21.466
Nice work, Fixit.

29:21.553 --> 29:24.431
Just give me a few more minutes
to adjust the timing.

29:24.513 --> 29:27.073
Max! Soldiers outside.

29:27.153 --> 29:29.906
Get away from the window! You too!

29:37.953 --> 29:41.502
Someone's been talking out of school.
Tie him up. We're leaving him here.

29:41.593 --> 29:44.153
Fixit, we gotta go now!

29:44.833 --> 29:46.824
What the hell...?

29:50.313 --> 29:52.588
Why use smokers?
I thought they wanted us dead.

29:52.673 --> 29:54.664
Me too. Come on, hurry up.

29:58.873 --> 30:01.865
I want all units to advance.
Approach pattern - Omega 13.

30:02.433 --> 30:06.267
As soon as it starts, get the hell out.
That's an order!

30:33.673 --> 30:36.665
Go. You heard what she said. Move it!

31:02.953 --> 31:05.626
Foxtrot One to Command.
We have her, sir.

31:05.713 --> 31:10.229
- Say again, Foxtrot One.
- We have X5-452.

31:23.793 --> 31:28.150
Sorry. I didn't know
somebody else was in here.

31:33.793 --> 31:36.182
You don't look so hot.

31:36.913 --> 31:41.782
Probably need some sun, huh? Bet they
had you all hooked up back at Manticore.

31:41.873 --> 31:45.422
Nice sandy barrack. Heat lamps.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.862
Sorry.

31:52.833 --> 31:55.142
I hate those things.

32:05.673 --> 32:08.551
You want it?

32:11.513 --> 32:14.152
Yes? No?

32:20.233 --> 32:22.508
Nice move.

32:26.753 --> 32:28.823
Having a little family reunion?

32:31.153 --> 32:33.223
You must be the new bad guy in my life.

32:34.273 --> 32:37.231
You know, 452, you're much prettier
than in your picture.

32:37.313 --> 32:40.908
Gee, miss the old bad guys already.

32:40.993 --> 32:45.748
I had a chance to peruse the DNA workup
done during your recent stay at Manticore.

32:45.833 --> 32:50.384
Let me guess. My insurance didn't cover it
and you want me to go outta pocket.

32:50.473 --> 32:53.067
Are you familiar with the term "junk DNA"?

32:53.153 --> 32:57.271
Layman's terms for base pairs
that don't contain viable genetic information.

32:57.353 --> 32:59.583
Doesn't do much more than fill space.

32:59.673 --> 33:03.871
Kinda like that grey, squishy thing
in between your ears.

33:03.953 --> 33:08.185
Would you be surprised if I told you
that you didn't have any junk DNA?

33:08.553 --> 33:13.627
It seems every single base pair is coded
for some specific genetic purpose.

33:15.073 --> 33:18.190
Now, the money question is,
what does it mean?

33:20.713 --> 33:23.944
What is it that your genes are coded to do?

33:24.033 --> 33:26.672
Kick ass, mostly. After that, wouldn't know.

33:28.353 --> 33:32.312
Well, not to worry,
cos we're gonna find out.

33:48.233 --> 33:52.431
I can't believe we left her there
after all she did for us.

33:53.033 --> 33:55.672
She gave us a direct order.

33:56.513 --> 34:01.382
She told me we don't have to take orders
any more. Not from anyone, not even her.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.506
- That's good enough for me.
- Me too.

34:08.033 --> 34:10.422
- I'm in.
- Let's do it.

34:30.993 --> 34:35.464
They're headin' the wrong way.
You're headin' the wrong way!

34:39.433 --> 34:41.230
Typical.

34:53.873 --> 34:56.670
- Satellite's in range, sir.
- Line her up.

35:15.873 --> 35:20.230
Let me guess.
She got herself caught saving your butts.

35:20.313 --> 35:22.304
Pretty much.

35:23.073 --> 35:25.303
All right.

35:25.393 --> 35:27.588
Well, let's get this over with.

35:49.753 --> 35:53.109
Keep at it. I'm gonna find out
what the hell's goin' on.

36:05.553 --> 36:08.192
- Alec.
- To the rescue.

36:10.393 --> 36:12.509
You still wanna kick my ass?

36:12.593 --> 36:14.584
Maybe later. Hurry up.

36:16.953 --> 36:18.944
Him too.

36:20.073 --> 36:22.268
- Are you kidding?
- Do it.

36:23.593 --> 36:26.949
It's gonna be OK.
We're gonna get you outta here.

36:28.393 --> 36:30.384
Go, go.

36:31.593 --> 36:35.472
- You're welcome. Come on, let's go.
- Wait. The laser show's still going.

36:35.553 --> 36:39.592
You wanna be the hero,
you can't be half-assed about it. Let's go.

36:43.593 --> 36:47.711
All those stars kinda make you feel
small and insignificant, huh?

37:11.233 --> 37:14.270
We got a security breach.
The perimeter has been compromised.

37:14.353 --> 37:16.742
- What is it?
- That's not the signal to regroup.

37:16.833 --> 37:22.032
- It's a signal to scatter and go to ground.
- White to all units. Disable the signal now.

37:32.553 --> 37:34.942
It's done. Trash it.

37:43.993 --> 37:45.904
Come on.

37:52.593 --> 37:55.471
We gotta get outta here. Go, go.

38:13.233 --> 38:16.305
IDs and passports to get you
across the border to Canada.

38:16.393 --> 38:18.509
Are we ever going to see you again?

38:20.153 --> 38:22.462
Promise.

38:22.553 --> 38:26.705
Now, I'm gonna drop a little wisdom
on you grunts, so pay attention.

38:26.793 --> 38:30.832
First time I got out in the world,
I lost track of all the kids I escaped with.

38:31.233 --> 38:35.670
Spent the next ten years tryin' to find 'em.
Don't let that happen to you. Stay together.

38:36.193 --> 38:38.184
You're family.

38:39.313 --> 38:44.785
- I'm outta here before the waterworks start.
- Hold on. We have one last thing to do.

38:44.873 --> 38:47.387
- As soldiers.
- And what's that?

38:47.473 --> 38:49.862
Pay our respects to those who didn't make it.

38:52.873 --> 38:55.182
Attention!

40:11.673 --> 40:15.268
- Thanks for comin' through on their papers.
- No problem.

40:19.473 --> 40:23.944
You did a good thing, Max.
Not just for them, but for all of 'em.

40:25.593 --> 40:28.187
They'll figure it out.

40:31.113 --> 40:34.105
So, you headin' back into town?

40:34.193 --> 40:36.229
Yeah, I'll take a ride.

40:36.313 --> 40:38.429
Clear my head.

40:53.113 --> 40:56.662
I look at Logan and I wanna take
my own advice and stay together.

40:56.753 --> 41:01.543
But how are we supposed to do that,
when his life depends on us staying apart?

41:01.633 --> 41:04.352
Who knows? Maybe we can beat this thing.

41:04.433 --> 41:07.789
I guess we'll just have to see
where this road takes us.

41:29.553 --> 41:31.783
