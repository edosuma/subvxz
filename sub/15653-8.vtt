02:05.382 --> 02:08.776

02:08.812 --> 02:11.113
My slaves are ready to serve.

02:11.148 --> 02:13.587
The Peacekeeper's
wife and child are mine.

02:14.546 --> 02:17.018
And only one piece
of the puzzle remains.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.953
I'm working on it.

02:18.989 --> 02:21.457

02:58.896 --> 03:02.664
You said all the Lords
were dead, except Venganza.

03:02.700 --> 03:07.603
Well, Venganza has many obsessions.

03:07.638 --> 03:09.104
And one of them...

03:10.474 --> 03:11.473
is her.

03:13.677 --> 03:15.343
Her name is Yalida.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.581
I used to arrange private shows
at one of Venganza's hideaways.

03:19.617 --> 03:21.383

03:21.418 --> 03:23.352
I'm sure of it.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.593
And she trusts me.

03:56.720 --> 03:59.154
Do you know why they dance?

04:00.357 --> 04:01.523
Never asked.

04:02.104 --> 04:05.226
It is a lament, a sorrow.

04:05.262 --> 04:09.097
It comes from centuries of living
in the darkest corners of the world.

04:10.201 --> 04:12.801
No lives. No will.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.036

04:25.675 --> 04:29.076
No, but she has new aficionados,

Carlos and Santanico.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.393
She is no such thing,

04:38.429 --> 04:40.095

04:42.066 --> 04:43.131
Finish her.

04:43.167 --> 04:45.067

- Get up.

Bringing us back together.

Yeah, well, destiny's

<i>Mi amor...</i>

06:31.875 --> 06:34.009
There was a tunnel under the barn.

06:34.044 --> 06:36.078
We never figured out where it led to.

06:36.113 --> 06:37.913
It leads to Amaru.

06:37.948 --> 06:39.715
Then your wife and kid must be close by.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.283
And that's all that matters.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.718
Technically, it's not all that matters.

06:42.753 --> 06:44.820
It's not, Richard, but he's right.

06:45.448 --> 06:46.420
So, how would we even start?

06:46.457 --> 06:47.956
I've got a Ranger buddy.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.292
He's got access to
a ground-penetrating radar.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.527

07:26.150 --> 07:29.563
I understand you... infants...

07:29.600 --> 07:32.334

I mean, who are you people?

08:25.722 --> 08:28.723
Ragtag band of criminals
and bloodsuckers,

08:28.759 --> 08:31.493
fighting for what? Truth? Justice?

08:32.131 --> 08:33.595
The Mexican-American way?

08:48.812 --> 08:51.512
You know, if I decided
to chop you up with this,

08:52.449 --> 08:54.049
outcome's gonna be a little different.

08:55.486 --> 08:59.754
Yeah, the Xibalbans make great weapons.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.668
And their Queen is also going to win.

09:02.960 --> 09:06.027
Unless we take what she wants.

09:06.063 --> 09:08.230
Unless we take Venganza.

09:08.265 --> 09:09.517

09:10.437 --> 09:13.614
I will tell you where,
and I'll tell you how.

09:15.816 --> 09:18.373
But I want in.

09:20.444 --> 09:22.544
I always wanted to work

09:22.579 --> 09:25.280

09:25.315 --> 09:27.482
We'll start from there,
work our way down.

09:27.518 --> 09:29.251
He'll talk, won't you, Carlitos?

09:29.286 --> 09:30.751
Nah.

09:32.189 --> 09:34.456
Carlito wants to play...

09:34.855 --> 09:36.257
he can play.

09:36.736 --> 09:39.844

use the extra cannon fodder.

09:40.496 --> 09:41.495
Really?

09:43.746 --> 09:44.979
You're in.

09:48.504 --> 09:49.905
Now talk.

09:50.525 --> 09:52.941

[Richie] <i>They ate her,
they kept her blood,</i>

09:56.195 --> 09:57.945
which is how it got into Kate.

09:57.981 --> 09:59.748
Did you know that she kept the bones?

09:59.783 --> 10:01.134
Lemme guess.

10:01.885 --> 10:04.286
Venganza's the only
one who knows where they are.

10:40.824 --> 10:42.046
<i>No warden.</i>

10:42.842 --> 10:44.793

11:08.085 --> 11:10.552
<i>However, they serve

11:10.587 --> 11:12.233

11:21.303 --> 11:22.901
<i>she runs it like a snake pit.</i>

11:23.367 --> 11:26.001
She's surrounded. She's protected.

11:26.036 --> 11:28.108
The only way you're going to get to her

11:28.672 --> 11:30.105

11:33.944 --> 11:36.177
Okay. He's in? I'm out.

11:36.213 --> 11:37.879
You guys got plenty of hands on deck.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.914
I'm gonna grab the boys
and track down those tunnels.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.483
Fair enough. Stay in touch.

11:44.021 --> 11:46.655
All right, Richard, we need a plan.

11:47.094 --> 11:49.190
A big one, all right?

11:53.296 --> 11:56.364
Scott, keep an eye on Carlito.

12:00.514 --> 12:02.203
So, let me get this straight.

12:02.239 --> 12:06.341
You spent all this fucking time
chasing him down, but for what?

12:06.658 --> 12:08.443
Why do you suddenly
give a shit about this?

12:08.478 --> 12:10.378
I want Venganza
as much as everyone else.

12:10.414 --> 12:11.557
Bullshit.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.339

we're going after her.

12:15.023 --> 12:16.022

He used to hang 'em up on crosses,

33:25.959 --> 33:27.392
wait for the sun to come up.

33:28.995 --> 33:30.294
Watch 'em burn.

33:32.599 --> 33:35.119
I like to think of us as a...

33:36.870 --> 33:38.703
bad ol' boys club.

33:38.738 --> 33:40.171
[chuckles]

33:44.744 --> 33:46.293
Place of Dead Roads.

33:47.380 --> 33:49.447
Earl used to say that was
the last stop before hell.

33:49.482 --> 33:52.865
It is that, most definitely.

33:53.486 --> 33:56.020
That's where the Queen
had them tunnels built to.

33:56.056 --> 33:59.691
Sweet little town of Matanzas, Texas.

34:01.061 --> 34:02.560
Used to be hoppin'.

34:02.595 --> 34:04.040
Matanzas.

34:05.351 --> 34:06.364
We'll be ready.

34:08.668 --> 34:10.301
Can't do much without them bones.

34:10.335 --> 34:11.578
Bones?

34:11.905 --> 34:13.369
You know, the Queen's.

34:14.274 --> 34:16.481
You need the lady Lord
to bring 'em, right?

34:20.080 --> 34:21.145
I suppose so.

34:21.496 --> 34:23.393
[chuckles]

34:24.217 --> 34:25.550
Brasa didn't tell you, did he?

34:30.924 --> 34:34.391
They've already got my family.
I ain't worth nothin' to 'em.

34:44.036 --> 34:46.571
What if I got you something bigger?

34:50.643 --> 34:52.310
Bigger than a dead Peacekeeper.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.913
I doubt you could deliver.

34:55.949 --> 34:57.861
Never know till you ask.

34:58.585 --> 35:00.373
Get him on the phone.

35:00.787 --> 35:02.787
Tell him I have an offer.

35:06.526 --> 35:09.293
[combat grunts]

35:09.329 --> 35:10.561
Go, go, go!

35:12.165 --> 35:14.132
Come on, we gotta go.
They're gonna hit us again.

35:14.167 --> 35:15.800
I need to heal.

35:18.972 --> 35:20.772
Easy. Easy.

35:24.811 --> 35:25.877
I lied to you.

35:25.912 --> 35:27.111
About what?

35:27.147 --> 35:29.080
About why I'm here.

35:29.516 --> 35:32.517
- Yeah, just forget about it. It's fine.
- No.

35:34.854 --> 35:36.515
When Manola died...

35:37.791 --> 35:38.939
I ran.

35:39.793 --> 35:42.560
I ran. It was... I was pissed.

35:42.595 --> 35:44.796
I had things to figure out, and...

35:44.831 --> 35:46.964
I just kept on thinking about you.

35:47.746 --> 35:48.716
What?

35:50.937 --> 35:53.504
How you got the shit
beat out of you in that ring.

35:53.540 --> 35:56.274
How you...

35:56.309 --> 35:58.142
kept on fighting for us...

36:01.014 --> 36:02.480
for the culebras who...

36:02.925 --> 36:04.782
Well, I mean...

36:04.818 --> 36:07.785
the enemy of my enemy and all that shit.

36:07.821 --> 36:10.354
Yeah. Yeah, well,

36:10.390 --> 36:13.491
I'm not gonna let you have
all the fun taking 'em down.

36:16.029 --> 36:19.997
That, uh, girlfriend of yours,

36:20.033 --> 36:23.401
you used to feed on her,
without turning her, right?

36:25.305 --> 36:27.572
Well, way I see it,

36:27.607 --> 36:31.909
we're at war with General
Whatever-the-fuck, right?

36:33.513 --> 36:35.012
Consider it rations.

36:38.651 --> 36:40.852
[low growl]

36:47.651 --> 36:50.238
- How about is in there?
- Bad. And gettin' worse.

36:59.626 --> 37:01.626
What? She needed to feed.

37:02.352 --> 37:03.792
Smart.

37:04.126 --> 37:05.521
You know, I haven't healed yet.

37:05.546 --> 37:06.486
Not a chance.

37:06.849 --> 37:08.849
So you brought the enemy to my door.

37:09.974 --> 37:11.974
- What's next.
- What's next.

37:13.293 --> 37:15.293
What's next is you tell us
where the bones are.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.207
Or you kill me?

37:17.281 --> 37:18.607
There are no bones.

37:19.366 --> 37:22.349
The Lords fed on Amaru,
but they didn't just feed on her.

37:22.570 --> 37:25.083
We consumed her. All of her.

37:25.570 --> 37:27.570
The only way for Amaru
to get her essence back

37:28.489 --> 37:30.489
is from the remains of the Seven Lords.

37:30.499 --> 37:31.998
She wants your ashes.

37:32.372 --> 37:33.751
That's why she killed all of 'em.

37:40.614 --> 37:42.614
[Richie] <i>She was after the ashes.</i>

37:43.268 --> 37:46.994
Well, Your Eminence, it seems
your value's just gone way up.

37:47.861 --> 37:49.600
I might have to double my price.

37:49.808 --> 37:51.808
[shouting voices approach]

37:56.918 --> 37:58.918
Hah!

38:16.781 --> 38:18.781
[exertion grunt]

38:22.445 --> 38:25.131
Wow. Someone's been doing Tae Bo.

38:25.858 --> 38:27.858
There's a fuck-ton more
where that came from.

38:28.098 --> 38:30.098
Yeah, but this won't end
until we get Tatuaje.

38:31.042 --> 38:32.909
Is there another way upstairs?

38:32.942 --> 38:34.478
- That way.
- All right, show me.

38:34.511 --> 38:37.348
<i>Mi amor,</i> we have a score to settle.

38:43.005 --> 38:43.940
<i>General.</i>

38:45.974 --> 38:48.110
Come and fight for yourself.

38:48.143 --> 38:50.380
I remember when you were a couple.

38:52.247 --> 38:55.051
Oh, I remember, too.
I'm just trying to forget.

38:57.086 --> 38:59.210
Because you have no loyalty.

38:59.923 --> 39:02.059
Not to this man, not to anyone.

39:03.325 --> 39:05.061
Well, he's got a valid point.

39:05.095 --> 39:08.832
Says the man who gets
loyalty with tricks.

39:08.865 --> 39:10.582
Such a lovely trick,

39:11.446 --> 39:13.483
and such a lovely <i>diosa.</i>

39:15.972 --> 39:18.941
Him, I'm going to take apart
again, but you...

39:18.975 --> 39:20.377
[faint chuckle]

39:20.410 --> 39:23.881
you are going to be mine
in so many ways.

39:28.251 --> 39:30.086
[shrieks]

40:11.394 --> 40:14.231
[laughing]

40:27.242 --> 40:28.845
Time to join the army, <i>linda.</i>

40:36.638 --> 40:37.640
Hey, Tatuaje.

40:39.955 --> 40:41.492
I want my money back.

41:10.986 --> 41:12.421
[impact grunt]

41:12.455 --> 41:15.092
[General Tatuaje groans]

41:18.093 --> 41:19.495
I told you we still got it.

41:23.098 --> 41:24.401
[Amaru] I knew it.

41:25.468 --> 41:27.404
All of that ambition.

41:29.305 --> 41:30.307
And for what?

41:32.041 --> 41:34.077
You want your place in the new realm?

41:35.210 --> 41:37.279
You're useless to me.

41:37.304 --> 41:39.240
Hold that thought, my Queen.

42:20.408 --> 42:22.010
What is he doing here?

42:22.035 --> 42:24.038
Rest of the team's mountin' up.

42:27.629 --> 42:28.965
Carlito.

42:36.878 --> 42:39.181
The Ranger just came back
with some key intel.

42:39.341 --> 42:41.410
Where the rest of this is goin' down:

42:41.443 --> 42:44.113
Matanzas, Texas.

42:44.147 --> 42:45.916
It's about a hundred miles
into the big nothin'.

42:45.948 --> 42:49.586
Matanzas. Yeah, of course. I know it.

42:49.618 --> 42:51.655
Why didn't you tell us?

42:51.687 --> 42:54.023
It didn't occur to me.
What does it matter? Now we know.

42:54.057 --> 42:55.358
[chains clanking]

42:55.390 --> 42:57.226
[Venganza] Let me go!

42:57.260 --> 42:59.229
- What the fuck are you doing?
- If it's all the same to you...

42:59.262 --> 43:01.231
I'll be taking Lord Venganza
to the ceremony.

43:01.263 --> 43:02.464
What ceremony?

43:02.497 --> 43:04.066
The one where I get
my wife and kid back.

43:04.100 --> 43:06.502
You guys try anything,
I'll put a stake in her chest.

43:06.535 --> 43:09.271
Cisco Kid has lost his fucking mind!

43:09.305 --> 43:11.073
Don't do this!

43:27.189 --> 43:29.492
You're making a huge mistake.

43:29.524 --> 43:30.459
We'll see.
