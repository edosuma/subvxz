Welcome to Mexia, Texas, my hometown.

and it's not.

It's Mexia. M-E-X-I-A, by the way.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.143
And I'm gonna show you
through my hometown.

with me. Come on!

This is Mexia High, home of the Blackcats,
and this is where I went to school.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.194
I wasn't very popular in high school.

03:15.778 --> 03:17.322

where I used to work for four years.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.211

03:53.316 --> 03:58.696
Um, I switched around a lot
and stayed with my aunt most of the time

03:59.948 --> 04:01.491
because of my home life.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.533
Um…

04:03.201 --> 04:06.371

was Vickie Lynn,

She wanted to put makeup on me.
I wouldn't.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.624
I said, "I don't do that kinda stuff."

05:33.708 --> 05:38.171
She said, "Real men
let women put makeup on 'em."

me, Vickie, and Mom,

05:46.637 --> 05:49.474
all of us went to church.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.644
We… We were all God-fearing people.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.273
She always wanted to be the center
of attention.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.318
And she enjoyed it.
She loved being the center of attention.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.364
We would go to the mall,
and I swear to you,

06:04.447 --> 06:11.204
there would be 50 men and boys
walking behind us.

06:11.287 --> 06:15.416
And she says, "Mom, look!"
I said, "I know. I see 'em. Come on."

06:16.334 --> 06:20.213
Vickie was always beautiful.
She just… She was just born beautiful.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.841

with this 29-year-old man
that Vickie Lynn was infatuated with.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.240
I had her windows nailed shut

without me knowing about it.

just wanted to take her out.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.252
Billy was a cook.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.923
She, uh, asked Billy one day
to give her a ride home,

07:46.007 --> 07:48.968
because she didn't have a car,
and he said, "No."

07:49.051 --> 07:52.638
And it just absolutely stunned her.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.349
Who was he thinking he was?

07:57.143 --> 08:00.313
So after that,
she chased him 'til she got him.

08:00.813 --> 08:04.317
She got him, and…
and they got married right there in Mexia.

And I thought, "Well, if I have a baby,
I'll never be lonely again."

08:42.438 --> 08:44.524

to take her under your wing

12:11.647 --> 12:12.940

12:14.024 --> 12:15.776

So I said, "Okay. If that's what you wanna
be called, then I'll call you Nicky."

My stepfathers had… had raped me
and… and beaten me,

13:43.489 --> 13:46.700

14:04.802 --> 14:07.638
She was in law enforcement,
and she was kind of a tyrant.

14:07.721 --> 14:11.809
Well, she would handcuff her to the bed
for days and just beat her mercilessly.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.396
[crowd clamoring]

14:15.479 --> 14:18.899
[Missy] And I'm buying
a lot of what she's telling me.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.695
You know, I don't have any reason
to disbelieve her.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.662
[camera shutters clicking]

14:31.745 --> 14:33.372
[music fades]

14:36.709 --> 14:40.421
[Missy] She told me all the time
that she was gonna be a famous model.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.423
[dramatic music playing]

14:42.506 --> 14:45.593
I would be like, "Yeah, yeah,
of course you are." 'Cause you know?

14:45.676 --> 14:47.261
"Of course you will, dear."

14:47.344 --> 14:48.762
But, um… [chuckling]

14:48.846 --> 14:51.473
…she, uh, she was convinced

14:51.557 --> 14:54.059
that the only thing holding her back
was her boobs.

14:59.315 --> 15:02.151
So she set out on a mission
to get a boob job.

15:03.652 --> 15:04.862
God, it… it was painful.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.239
You know, it was horrible
to watch somebody go through that,

15:07.323 --> 15:08.908
because it… it hurts like hell.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.578
And that is where she started
on her, uh, pain pills.

15:12.661 --> 15:19.043
Valium, Xanax, Lortabs, uh,
Vicodin, and, um, the Klonopin.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.798
From that time on,
she was always taking them.

15:25.507 --> 15:28.093
There was nothing she could do
to stop it, you know.

15:32.473 --> 15:35.309
Being with her was…
was like a roller-coaster ride.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.895
It never got boring, I'll say that to you.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.358
We got in a lot of trouble together,
and, um…

15:42.441 --> 15:45.569
That's what I always say. It's like Nicky
had gas, and I had matches, you know?

15:45.653 --> 15:48.238
And when we got together,
it was combustible. Shit happened.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.700
I… I was in love with her.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.495
She was fun.

15:55.746 --> 16:00.000
She had a big heart, and she was kind.
You know, she really was kind.

16:01.126 --> 16:05.589
The whole thing, the… the whole friendship
with her in those early days

16:05.673 --> 16:07.299
was as good as it gets.

16:15.307 --> 16:18.310
I would like to meet a man,
but where do you meet them?

16:18.894 --> 16:21.021
Um, they have to love my son.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.732
They have to be nice, sweet.
I love a funny man.

16:24.316 --> 16:27.820
They have to be very, uh, sensual.

16:27.903 --> 16:29.446
I mean, I just love sensual.

16:29.530 --> 16:34.576
I like people to hold me, and cuddle me,
and watch movies with me,

16:34.660 --> 16:37.788
and just, you know, be very sweet and…

16:38.872 --> 16:41.875
[interviewer] But you're gonna go on
with your career even if you're married?

16:42.376 --> 16:44.128
-Yes, I will.
-[interviewer] Mm-hmm.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.507
And you will not, uh,
stop until you have fulfilled your dreams?

16:48.590 --> 16:49.633
Right.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.969
[pensive music playing]

16:59.893 --> 17:04.815
[Missy] Nicky started to tell me about,
uh, this… this man that she had met.

17:05.899 --> 17:07.860
She met him when she was dancing,

17:07.943 --> 17:12.614
and his wife had died, and he was
very, very distraught and… and depressed.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.909
She said that then he's starting
to fall in love with her,

17:15.993 --> 17:18.954
and he wants to marry her,
and he's a billionaire

17:19.038 --> 17:20.289
with a "b" not an "m."

17:20.372 --> 17:21.582
A "b," a billionaire.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.836
She told me his name
was J. Howard Marshall.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.589
[Anna] I love you, sweetheart.

17:29.089 --> 17:29.965
[Marshall] I love you.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.177
You're the light of my life,
now and always.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.346
[Anna] You're the light of my life,
now and always too, honey bunny.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.723
[Marshall] All right, sweetheart.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.016
[Anna] Do you miss rosebuds?

17:39.099 --> 17:39.933
[Marshall] What?

17:40.017 --> 17:41.268
Do you miss rosebuds?

17:41.351 --> 17:42.519
[Marshall] Yes, I do.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.104
[Anna] You wanna see rosebuds?

17:44.646 --> 17:45.689
[Marshall] I'd like to.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.775
[Anna] You want me to come over
and spend the night?

17:47.858 --> 17:48.692
[Marshall] Yep.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.777
[Anna] Okay, honey.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.905
[Missy] He bought her a car,

17:53.822 --> 17:57.785
and… and he bought her a home
so that she could be stable.

17:58.994 --> 18:01.038
And she quit working at topless clubs.

18:03.040 --> 18:07.044
It's like having a genie or something
just grant your every wish.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.631
He asked her to marry him several times.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.216
And she would tell him, "No."

18:12.299 --> 18:15.511
"I'm… I'm not gonna marry you
until I have a name for myself,

18:16.512 --> 18:18.972
because I don't want
people calling me a gold digger."

18:20.849 --> 18:22.476
And he said, "Okay, very well."

18:23.811 --> 18:25.229
[music fades]

18:27.815 --> 18:29.817
[contemplative music playing]

18:36.782 --> 18:41.370
[woman] I was the West Coast photo editor
for Playboy.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.164
That's me directing a shoot,

18:45.124 --> 18:48.252
which was the Playmate of the Year Car,
as I recall.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.506
Beautiful young girls
would want to be Playmates.

18:52.589 --> 18:57.678
It was akin to them as being Miss America.

18:58.428 --> 19:03.475
Some girls would try year after year,
but they wouldn't make it.

19:03.559 --> 19:04.393
[inaudible]

19:04.476 --> 19:09.273
[Marilyn] The Playmates, there was just
this kind of magic that they had.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.359
And they were so excited

19:12.442 --> 19:15.028
when they would get accepted
as a Playmate.

19:15.612 --> 19:20.868
My idea of what really worked
for the magazine

19:20.951 --> 19:23.871
was a very natural-looking girl.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.217
I heard from a photographer in Texas.

19:37.301 --> 19:41.597
He said, "I have pictures of this girl
I think would be a good Playmate."

19:44.099 --> 19:50.355
Frizzed-up hair, a lot of lipstick,
a lot of eye shadow, and…

19:51.398 --> 19:54.234
ample, to put it mildly.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.652
So I said, "Whew!"

19:56.153 --> 19:57.779
"What am I gonna do with this?"

19:59.156 --> 20:03.160
So I decided to bring her in
for a Playmate test.

20:03.911 --> 20:07.080
My staff thought I was crazy.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.124
[somber music playing]

20:09.208 --> 20:12.920
[Marilyn] So I brought her in.
She didn't have any makeup on at all.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.089
She had beautiful features.

20:17.090 --> 20:23.305
She had that wonderful aura about her
of not trying too hard, you know?

20:23.388 --> 20:29.811
She was just this sweet gal
with this incredible face.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.232
We started testing her.

20:35.484 --> 20:38.862
Well, the photographer said,
"You'd better come in here."

20:38.946 --> 20:40.030
So I went in here,

20:40.113 --> 20:43.075
and she was sitting in the corner
with a sheet on,

20:43.659 --> 20:45.327
and she was terrified.

20:45.410 --> 20:49.998
And I thought,
"God, how can I get over this with her?"

20:50.082 --> 20:54.336
So I talked to her,
and she had brought a record with her.

20:55.754 --> 21:00.092
And into the preliminary shoot,
we put on the record.

21:00.801 --> 21:07.391
And it was Marilyn Monroe singing
"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend."

21:07.474 --> 21:12.729
♪ A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental ♪

21:12.813 --> 21:15.941
♪ But diamonds are a girl's best friend ♪

21:16.024 --> 21:17.776
[Marilyn] And the minute I put
that record on,

21:17.859 --> 21:20.070
all of a sudden, she changed.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.447
She was a different person.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.241
[serene music playing]

21:33.250 --> 21:36.837
[Anna] Getting nude
was really hard for me.

21:37.587 --> 21:41.258
And I did it.
I'm not ashamed. I'm not ashamed at all.

21:42.259 --> 21:45.012
[interviewer] So what do you think
of Playboy as a magazine?

21:45.595 --> 21:48.765
Um, I think it's really a classy magazine.

21:50.976 --> 21:54.271
[interviewer] You called Playboy
a "dream magazine." Why?

21:54.771 --> 21:56.106
It was my dream,

21:56.189 --> 22:01.069
because it sort of kind of happened
to make my dreams come true.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.988
[cameras clicking]

22:03.613 --> 22:05.073
[Anna gasping, kissing]

22:05.157 --> 22:08.618
I put her on the cover
featuring debutants.

22:09.119 --> 22:12.748
She was the furthest thing
from a debutant you could ever find,

22:12.831 --> 22:16.543
but I had her prim and proper,
sitting there,

22:16.626 --> 22:20.714
without overacting,
just giving us that nice smile.

22:21.298 --> 22:24.384
Hef approved the cover right away,
and there she was.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.470
[dramatic music playing]

22:33.185 --> 22:37.189
Fame is something that people strive for,

22:37.272 --> 22:39.733
but the other side of that coin

22:39.816 --> 22:43.653
is that fame finds people
and won't let 'em go.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.701
[Missy] All those years,
she told me she'd be a famous model.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.620
Well, here she is.
She's doing it now, you know?

22:51.703 --> 22:54.790
Like, okay, you know, maybe…
'cause maybe I called it wrong.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.209
You go, girl.
I was, like, behind her all the way.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.544
Playboy had called,

22:59.628 --> 23:04.007
and they wanted her to come back out
and do, um, the Playmate of the Month.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.511
So, she needs someone
who could help with Daniel.

23:08.011 --> 23:09.179
[indistinct chatter]

23:09.262 --> 23:12.307
[Missy] So I moved into the house
in Spring, Texas.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.433
-Oh no!
-Oh no!

23:13.517 --> 23:16.520
[Missy] That is the first home that…
that Mr. Marshall had bought her.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.146
-[Anna] Hey, Missy!
-Go away. Go away.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.148
-[Anna] Hey!
-Yes, come on.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.234
-[Daniel] Let me have it.
-[man laughs]

23:23.110 --> 23:25.028
[Marilyn] Paul Marciano called me up.

23:25.779 --> 23:29.825
Paul was a good friend of mine,
and he was the head of Guess Jeans.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.744
And we started talking,

23:32.828 --> 23:36.081
and he commented on that girl
on the cover,

23:36.873 --> 23:38.291
and I said,

23:39.543 --> 23:41.837
"She is the new Claudia Schiffer."

23:42.546 --> 23:45.215
[commercial music playing]

23:49.970 --> 23:51.763
[ad narrator] Guess began
with the single dream

23:51.847 --> 23:53.807
of making jeans that are sexy,

23:53.890 --> 23:57.477
jeans that would show off a woman's body,
instead of hide it,

23:57.561 --> 24:00.981
jeans that would embrace
a woman's innate sensuality.

24:02.232 --> 24:05.360
[Missy] They were one of the biggest
jeans companies at the time,

24:05.444 --> 24:09.614
and Guess models
were all very, very famous.

24:09.698 --> 24:10.949
It was such a big deal.

24:11.616 --> 24:14.786
And she was really, really excited
about it.

24:14.870 --> 24:15.996
She just rolled out of bed,

24:16.079 --> 24:18.290
and she actually couldn't find
her hair tie.

24:18.373 --> 24:19.458
She took her thong off,

24:19.541 --> 24:21.501
and pulled her hair up,
put it in her hair.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.211
I was like, "Gross." [chuckling]

24:23.295 --> 24:25.714
And that's how she went.
And she came back. She looked great.

24:25.797 --> 24:28.258
They had done her hair and makeup,
and she really looked good.

24:28.341 --> 24:29.968
[contemplative music playing]

24:30.051 --> 24:31.511
[Missy] She was thrilled about it

24:31.595 --> 24:35.432
because Paul Marciano had told her
how great that they were coming out,

24:35.515 --> 24:36.808
and he… he was happy.

25:10.926 --> 25:13.053
[Missy] She said,
"Well, Paul and I decided

25:13.136 --> 25:15.972
that I need a… a name
that's less provincial."

25:16.056 --> 25:18.433
"You know, something more global."

25:19.559 --> 25:24.189
"I liked the name Anna, so I chose Anna,
and he put Nicole with it."

25:24.272 --> 25:27.400
And she said, "Voilà. Anna…
Anna Nicole Smith was born."

25:31.446 --> 25:33.615
"When we're in public, you call me that."

25:34.658 --> 25:37.536
"Don't call me Nicky in public.
I don't care if you keep calling me Nicky,

25:37.619 --> 25:40.622
but don't call me
anything but Anna Nicole in public."

[Missy] The first modeling trip
that I took with her was to LA,

25:56.096 --> 25:58.348
and I saw the billboards.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.850
They were everywhere, you know? She--

26:00.934 --> 26:03.603
I started to see her face, uh,
all over the place,

26:03.687 --> 26:05.355
and it was so exciting.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.315
She had arrived.

26:07.816 --> 26:11.403
She was big and bold, and it was just…

26:11.486 --> 26:13.405
It's… it was magical. It really was.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.616
She got an invitation
from the Coen Brothers

26:16.700 --> 26:19.744
to go and read for a part
in The Hudsucker Proxy.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.788

One of the Coen brothers
was sitting over on the couch.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.002
And Nicky went over
and sat in front of him.

26:27.085 --> 26:32.507
And he gave her, uh, you know, the script,
and he said, "Uh, can you read this?"

26:32.591 --> 26:34.217
And she read it, and he said,

26:34.301 --> 26:37.512
"Okay, can you do it
with more, you know, meow?"

26:37.596 --> 26:38.763
And… And she did,

26:38.847 --> 26:42.350
and he goes, "That's perfect.
That's exactly what we're looking for."

26:42.434 --> 26:44.561
I was just acting very calm.

26:44.644 --> 26:47.689

and got down to the bottom of the stairs,

27:13.965 --> 27:15.383
[Missy] I got out my camera. I said,

27:15.467 --> 27:18.428
"Come on. You know, like, we're not gonna
waste that look." [chuckling]

27:18.511 --> 27:21.139
[camera shutters clicking]

27:21.222 --> 27:23.099
[Missy] I'll be like,
"Come on, give it to me."

27:23.183 --> 27:25.435
And you know how they talk on… on TV

27:25.518 --> 27:27.896
when they're taking photographs,
that kind of thing.

27:29.522 --> 27:30.982
She was so beautiful.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.070
I… I was really in love with her.

27:37.489 --> 27:41.201
I was her first, uh,
female lover, I guess.

27:43.995 --> 27:46.998
She had an insatiable appetite for sex,
just like everything else.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.958
She enjoyed having sex.

27:50.710 --> 27:53.713
She was exceptionally--
She… She got a lot of practice.

27:53.797 --> 27:57.217
She was good at what she did.
She was a good lover, a very good lover.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.975
I found it impossible
to be intimate with a male.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.811
I just… I didn't trust men.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.940
But I found it very easy
to be intimate with her.

28:12.899 --> 28:16.861
And that kept me fulfilled,
you know, for a very long time.

28:18.988 --> 28:19.989
I loved her.

28:20.573 --> 28:21.991
[music fades]

28:24.119 --> 28:25.245
[reporters clamoring]

28:25.328 --> 28:26.871
[tense music playing]

28:26.955 --> 28:30.458
[anchor] The world knows Anna Nicole Smith
as the Guess girl.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.127
[camera shutters clicking]

28:32.210 --> 28:33.420
[indistinct chatter]

28:34.671 --> 28:39.092
[anchor] She'd been told she was too tall,
too blonde, and too shapely

28:39.175 --> 28:40.301
to make it as a model.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.096
-Watch out for her.
-I'm… I'm… I'm a lot taller. [chuckling]

28:43.179 --> 28:47.100
[anchor] But now this small-town
Texas girl is a sudden superstar.

28:47.809 --> 28:50.937
[man] If any of my kids came to me
and said, "Daddy, I want to be famous."

28:51.438 --> 28:52.272
No.

28:52.355 --> 28:55.191
Uh, it's… it's not all
it's cracked up to be.

28:55.275 --> 28:57.610
Yeah, sure, you'll be famous
and you'll be adored.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.362
People will put your picture on the wall.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.114
You'd have the fancy house
in Beverly Hills

29:01.197 --> 29:04.284
with the swimming pool
and the glamorous car on the driveway.

29:04.367 --> 29:07.954
But along with fame,
there's stuff that comes along.

29:08.037 --> 29:10.832
It's a bit like a slag heap from…
with a coal mine, right?

29:10.915 --> 29:14.919
You get the coal, you get the diamonds,
but there's all this waste material too.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.087
That's like fame.

29:16.171 --> 29:20.091
There is… There is stuff that comes along
which I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.469
-[reporters clamoring]
-[camera shutters clicking]

29:22.552 --> 29:26.806
[man] When Anna Nicole went out,
she knew how to make a good story.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.892
[reporter] Where'd you get
all the beautiful flowers?

29:28.975 --> 29:30.727
-This man here.
-[reporter] Jeez.

29:31.436 --> 29:35.231
Much of what happens
with celebrity and paparazzi is a game.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.441
It's…

29:36.524 --> 29:38.526
it's a waltz that you do.

29:38.610 --> 29:42.322
And they know that they're on camera,

29:42.405 --> 29:45.575
so they know
they're not really interacting with me.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.744
They're interacting with the world.

29:47.827 --> 29:50.205
-[reporters clamoring]
-[Anna laughing]

29:50.288 --> 29:53.750
[Ligier] So the beat that we worked
was the Sunset Strip

29:53.833 --> 29:56.419
from Hollywood
through West Hollywood and Beverly Hills.

29:57.170 --> 30:00.048
And we primarily did
the nightclub circuit.

30:00.882 --> 30:04.469
We would sometimes start
at, like, 12:00, 12:30 at night.

30:05.094 --> 30:06.262
And, um…

30:07.138 --> 30:09.057
Because we didn't wanna get there
too early.

30:09.140 --> 30:12.477
We wanted to wait until people were,
you know, somewhat inebriated.

30:13.812 --> 30:17.190
Particularly with the showbiz in America,
they were just fed…

30:17.273 --> 30:19.734
Most of it was… was… was a lie, mostly.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.694
It was… It was whatever
they wanted to promote.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.781
You know, "This actor is not gay.
They're straight. Look at the proof here."

30:24.864 --> 30:26.699
They'd… They'd swallow it
hook, line and sinker.

30:27.659 --> 30:28.701
But we didn't do that.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.287
Instead of going in the front door,
we were around the back door

30:31.371 --> 30:33.373
and… and picking up on the…
on the chauffeurs,

30:33.456 --> 30:35.166
who could tell you
what was really going on,

30:35.250 --> 30:37.210
on… on the maids coming out of the houses

30:37.293 --> 30:39.754
who told you what was going on
behind closed doors.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.506
…plenty of that. Shut that shit off.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.550
[reporters clamoring]

30:43.633 --> 30:47.262
Anna Nicole, she was a money shot
every time you saw her.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.223
This is my Valentine for today.

30:50.306 --> 30:53.059
For today! It's once a year, so for today.

30:53.142 --> 30:54.102
[Ligier] We'd get calls,

30:54.185 --> 30:57.146
"Hey, if you get anything on Anna Nicole,
we'll buy it."

30:57.647 --> 31:00.692
It would be at least $2,500 a clip.

31:00.775 --> 31:04.946
But oftentimes, 5,000 to 7,500 a clip
because she was so animated.

31:05.029 --> 31:05.864
[Anna laughing]

31:05.947 --> 31:07.198
[reporter] That's wonderful.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.659
You know,
I'd almost be shaking while filming it,

31:09.742 --> 31:11.452
knowing that they're gonna love this.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.079
[Anna] I was giving…

31:13.162 --> 31:15.498
She came alive when she would see us.

31:16.958 --> 31:18.668
I love my flowers.

31:18.751 --> 31:20.753
[reporters clamoring]

31:24.132 --> 31:26.342
[Arsenio] Do men
have a hard time approaching you?

31:26.426 --> 31:28.303
Oh, they do have a hard time
approaching me,

31:28.386 --> 31:30.847
but if I have a relationship,
they're not shy at all in bed.

31:30.930 --> 31:31.764
[Arsenio] Oh… Yeah.

31:31.848 --> 31:34.350
[Anna] I thought that's what
you were trying to say at first.

31:34.434 --> 31:37.645
-[Arsenio] Um, we can talk more about sex.
-[Anna] Okay!

31:37.729 --> 31:39.731
[Arsenio] I could ask you questions
I asked Dr. Ruth.

31:39.814 --> 31:42.358
You know what I asked Dr. Ruth?
Has she ever faked an orgasm?

31:42.442 --> 31:44.402
-Have you ever faked an orgasm?
-Absolutely.

31:44.485 --> 31:47.405
-[Arsenio] You have?
-Many times over.

31:47.488 --> 31:48.656
-[Arsenio] Why?
-How about you?

31:48.740 --> 31:50.283
-[Arsenio] What? Wait. Um…
-It's hard…

31:50.366 --> 31:53.119
[audience laughing, cheering]

32:03.338 --> 32:05.757
[Missy] We were shooting
at this house in Malibu,

32:05.840 --> 32:08.301
and when you looked
in the big plate-glass window,

32:08.384 --> 32:10.845
there was this gorgeous picture
of Marilyn Monroe.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.222
It took up the whole wall.

32:13.306 --> 32:16.351
Nicky was looking in the window and
she said, "Oh my God! Come look at this."

32:16.434 --> 32:18.978
"I have got to get in this house
and take a picture."

32:19.062 --> 32:23.983
This beautiful girl just caught my eye.

32:24.067 --> 32:28.321
They were yelling at her,
the director, "Don't disturb the tenants."

32:28.404 --> 32:30.990
So I opened the door,
and they were saying, "We're sorry."

32:31.074 --> 32:32.408
I said, "It's okay. Honest."

32:32.492 --> 32:33.576
[camera shutter clicking]

32:33.660 --> 32:37.580
There was really a deep bond
between her and Marilyn.

32:37.664 --> 32:38.706
[camera shutter clicking]

32:38.790 --> 32:40.291
She really felt like

32:40.375 --> 32:46.089
maybe she was
Marilyn's reincarnated daughter.

32:46.172 --> 32:47.256
[camera shutter clicking]

32:47.882 --> 32:52.512
We became friends,
and she found out I had the guest house.

32:52.595 --> 32:55.515
I said, "Well, you can stay here
if you want, Anna, anytime you want."

32:55.598 --> 32:56.557
She said, "Really?"

32:57.892 --> 32:58.726
[Anna] Hello.

32:59.477 --> 33:03.690
[Ashley] I think it meant, for her,
that she had privacy,

33:03.773 --> 33:06.609
that she was… she could be herself.

33:08.778 --> 33:12.865
Um, there's two major movies
that want me at once,

33:13.366 --> 33:15.535
and they're both shooting
at the same time.

33:16.369 --> 33:20.873
Um, one's called The Mask
by Chuck Russell, and one is Naked Gun 3.

33:21.582 --> 33:22.417
[smacks lips]

33:22.500 --> 33:25.712
Um, The Mask movie I've had
for about four months.

33:25.795 --> 33:29.632
I really haven't read the script
until last week.

33:29.716 --> 33:30.800
So, um…

33:33.177 --> 33:36.097
It's got Jim Carrey in it, that funny guy.

33:37.140 --> 33:40.101
So, I love the script.

33:41.269 --> 33:43.896
But the thing is, is…

33:43.980 --> 33:45.857
[sighs] They offered me…

33:45.940 --> 33:48.568
This… I have a lead role,
the lead girl role,

33:48.651 --> 33:51.029
and they offered me only-- [laughs]

33:51.112 --> 33:52.530
This is embarrassing.

33:52.613 --> 33:55.074
They offered me $50,000.

33:56.159 --> 33:58.036
[pen tapping]

34:01.330 --> 34:02.415
[Anna] Right.

34:03.207 --> 34:06.878
I love it, and I think
it'd show more of my acting ability.

34:10.465 --> 34:11.924
Me too. [chuckling]

34:12.008 --> 34:13.801
Okay. Thanks.

34:14.635 --> 34:17.513
[Ashley] I'm not sure
what Anna needed her refuge from.

34:19.307 --> 34:20.224
[Anna sighing]

34:20.892 --> 34:21.934
Business.

34:24.020 --> 34:27.356
Um, maybe from her… herself. I don't know.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.319
[contemplative music playing]

34:35.656 --> 34:37.825
[phone line ringing]

34:42.497 --> 34:43.706
[woman] Marshall residence.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.666
[Anna] I need to speak
with Howard, please.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.251
-[woman] Okay, hold on.
-[Anna] Mm-hmm.

34:48.753 --> 34:49.796
[Marshall] Hello, precious.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.130
[Anna] Hi, honey.

34:51.214 --> 34:52.507
[Marshall] How's my lady fair?

34:52.590 --> 34:55.218
[Anna] I'm doing okay. I miss you, though.

34:55.718 --> 34:57.553
[Marshall] I miss you too.

34:58.137 --> 34:59.180
[Anna] Do you miss me?

34:59.722 --> 35:01.099
[Marshall] Very, very much.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.183
[Anna] How much?

35:03.476 --> 35:04.769
[Marshall] Light of my life.

35:04.852 --> 35:06.562
[Anna] You're the light of mine, honey.

35:07.063 --> 35:08.689
I love you. Give me a kiss.

35:08.773 --> 35:09.857
[kissing]

35:10.608 --> 35:11.776
[Anna] Love you, sweetie.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.361
[Marshall] Take care, precious package.

35:13.444 --> 35:14.320
[Anna] I will.

35:14.403 --> 35:16.405
[music continues]

35:24.664 --> 35:25.748
[music fades]

35:31.170 --> 35:32.421
[Anna] Cowboy.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.507
[music playing over radio]

35:45.101 --> 35:46.227
[Anna] There's Jesus.

35:46.727 --> 35:51.440
[woman] When I first went to meet Anna,
I was, uh, taking a document,

35:51.941 --> 35:55.820
and she breezed in,
and Howard wanted to talk to me.

35:56.737 --> 35:59.490
He wanted to adopt Daniel, Anna's son.

36:01.951 --> 36:06.831
He wanted to do that, clearly,
to protect Anna and Daniel.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.958
Because if Daniel was his son,

36:09.041 --> 36:11.544
then he would be his heir,
and they would be protected.

36:11.627 --> 36:15.548
There would be nothing
that his family could do

36:15.631 --> 36:17.425
to freeze them out.

36:17.508 --> 36:18.926
[somber music playing]

36:22.430 --> 36:23.806
[Daniel] Is that a statue?

36:27.101 --> 36:29.228
-[Anna chuckling]
-[Marshall laughing]

36:31.647 --> 36:36.444
[Kelly] He told me, "Tell him to go ahead.
Tell him to go ahead.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.029
Make sure it happens."

36:38.529 --> 36:42.241
So I went back to the lawyer
I was working for,

36:42.325 --> 36:46.329
and I said to him
that Howard was very insistent

36:46.412 --> 36:49.081
that he wanted this adoption
to go forward.

36:49.165 --> 36:52.668
And the lawyer looked at me
and just rolled his eyes.

36:52.752 --> 36:53.586
[scoffing]

36:57.965 --> 37:02.678
The lawyer was just completely dismissive,
which was really peculiar.

37:05.431 --> 37:08.476
[Daniel] Mama, that is… What's that?

37:09.352 --> 37:11.354
[indistinct chatter]

37:11.437 --> 37:14.523
[Kelly] I don't want… I don't ever want
to give the impression

37:15.066 --> 37:18.611
that the relationship
that Anna had with Howard

37:18.694 --> 37:21.822
was simply a gold digger
kind of relationship.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.407
Uh, what impressed me,

37:24.200 --> 37:28.287
uh, between the two of them
was how much they loved each other

37:28.371 --> 37:30.539
and how well-suited they were
to each other.

37:30.623 --> 37:33.542
And that seems terribly improbable to say.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.711
She was such a young, voluptuous woman,

37:36.295 --> 37:39.966
and he was an… little, old gnome of a man,

37:40.049 --> 37:42.593
but they were both, um…

37:42.677 --> 37:44.971
[smacks lips]
…kind of extraordinary people

37:45.471 --> 37:48.599
that… that other people were always trying
to take pieces of.

37:48.683 --> 37:52.353
And Howard and Anna were protection
for each other.

37:53.020 --> 37:55.147
They got each other.

37:56.190 --> 37:58.234
[Anna] Daniel wants to say hi to you.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.446
-[Daniel] Hi, Dad.
-[Marshall] Hi, Daniel.

38:04.490 --> 38:05.700
I love you, Daddy.

38:06.325 --> 38:07.243
[Marshall] I love you.

38:07.827 --> 38:08.744
[Daniel] Okay.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.717
[gentle music playing]

38:34.437 --> 38:37.231
[man] We lived in, uh, Oakhurst, Texas.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.860
And there was, like, 215 people
in the whole entire town.

38:42.528 --> 38:48.075
There's literally a post office,
a… a gas station, and a… a bait shop.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.285
[Donnie chuckling]

38:52.288 --> 38:55.583
[Missy] Nicky had never known
her biological father,

38:56.083 --> 38:59.879
and she believed it was because her mother
was just an impossible tyrant

38:59.962 --> 39:02.673
who didn't want her
to have her father around.

39:05.217 --> 39:10.639
So Nicky had, uh, built a vision
in her head of who this… this man was,

39:10.723 --> 39:13.642
and… and she just knew
he had to be out there looking for her

39:13.726 --> 39:14.935
like she was looking for him.

39:16.562 --> 39:18.564
[phone ringing]

39:19.315 --> 39:21.317
[birds chirping]

39:22.485 --> 39:25.863
[Donnie] Well, we had
a private investigator call the house

39:25.946 --> 39:31.160
and want to know if, uh… if my father
wanted to talk to his daughter.

39:31.952 --> 39:34.747
And he wouldn't really give
any information.

39:34.830 --> 39:38.376
Just wanted to pretty much know if…
if he wanted to speak to her.

39:38.459 --> 39:40.461
He said, "Yeah, yeah, I'll talk to her."

39:40.544 --> 39:42.546
And he hung up the phone,

39:43.255 --> 39:45.341
and then of course the phone rings.

39:45.424 --> 39:50.763
And then, uh, you know, he picks it up
and, uh, started talking to her,

39:50.846 --> 39:54.183
and she's wanting to bring us
out to California,

39:54.266 --> 39:57.269
but she wouldn't really tell us
much information.

39:57.353 --> 39:58.729
…gonna go see my Daddy.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.107
You know, her last name, anything.

40:01.190 --> 40:05.152
Just like, "Hey, I got tickets for you,
and, you know, come see me." [chuckling]

40:06.153 --> 40:07.113
[Anna] Hi!

40:07.196 --> 40:08.280
[radio playing commercial]

40:08.364 --> 40:09.573
[man] What a sweetheart.

40:12.827 --> 40:13.869
So, um,

40:13.953 --> 40:17.039
what did you say the very first time
when you called them up?

40:19.041 --> 40:21.085
I don't remember. I was shaking.

40:21.961 --> 40:23.129
I was very emotional.

40:23.212 --> 40:25.089
I was trying not to cry
because I had makeup on.

40:25.172 --> 40:26.549
I was going… Aah!

40:26.632 --> 40:28.300
[man] And what was your father's reaction?

40:28.384 --> 40:31.303
He was so happy. Like, freaking out.

40:31.387 --> 40:35.057
He said he waited for this day
for years and years and years.

40:35.141 --> 40:37.768
And he said there wasn't one night
he would go to sleep,

40:37.852 --> 40:39.562
and I wasn't in his prayers.

40:41.063 --> 40:42.857
[radio playing indistinctly]

40:45.317 --> 40:46.360
[Anna] Hi!

40:47.778 --> 40:49.613
[Anna laughing]

40:49.697 --> 40:53.117
I was literally like,
"I have no idea what I'm walking into."

40:53.200 --> 40:56.245
You know, even my dad was like,
"There's something going on."

40:57.163 --> 41:00.207
We just know we're supposed to meet her
there at the, uh, airport.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.292
[indistinct chatter]

41:01.375 --> 41:02.293
There she is.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.503
[Anna] Is that my daddy?

41:04.587 --> 41:05.588
[man] That's him.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.217
[man] Let me get this for you.

41:12.219 --> 41:13.429
[Anna giggling]

41:18.976 --> 41:19.977
Love you!

41:21.103 --> 41:26.442
[Donnie] This beautiful girl, you know,
comes out with pigtails. [laughs]

41:26.525 --> 41:27.443
Brother?

41:28.777 --> 41:32.448
[Donnie] And I'm like,
"Is this her?" You know?

41:32.531 --> 41:34.492
[Anna speaking indistinctly, laughing]

41:34.575 --> 41:36.660
Honestly, I was still in shock.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.830
This is my daddy and my brother!

41:41.457 --> 41:44.084
…go to my car and get the stuff out?

41:44.168 --> 41:46.212
[Donnie] And she goes,
"Do you know who I am?"

41:47.171 --> 41:48.631
"You've never seen me before?"

41:50.049 --> 41:52.593
I believe, uh,
Missy, uh, was in there too,

41:52.676 --> 41:55.513
and, uh, she was, like, going,

41:55.596 --> 41:57.389
"You… You don't recognize her?
You don't--"

41:57.473 --> 42:00.017
And, "She might be hanging on your wall."

42:00.100 --> 42:02.186
Yes! My daddy.

42:02.269 --> 42:03.354
[rock music playing]

42:03.437 --> 42:05.147
Okay, now I'll tell you what I do.

42:06.023 --> 42:07.149
[Donnie] I gotta hear this.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.236
Um, I'm a Guess model.

42:10.319 --> 42:12.780
I'm also Playmate of the Year this year.

42:13.864 --> 42:16.617
Um, do you know who Guess jeans is?

42:17.117 --> 42:19.912
Maybe who… who Hugh Hefner is.

42:19.995 --> 42:21.372
-[Anna] Yes.
-[nervous chuckle] Yes.

42:22.081 --> 42:24.708
[Anna] Hugh Hefner's part
of our family now.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.586
[man] You'll be at the Playboy Mansion
Sunday night.

42:27.670 --> 42:30.047
[Anna] You'll be at the Mansion tomorrow
to meet everybody.

42:30.130 --> 42:31.924
[man] So you'll meet Hef in person.

42:32.466 --> 42:34.843
-She's been so excited about this.
-[Anna chuckling]

42:34.927 --> 42:37.555
-[man] Man, you couldn't believe it.
-Yeah, I have.

42:39.223 --> 42:42.768
It's a great day.
It's so good to see this.

42:44.770 --> 42:46.230
Oh gosh, okay.

42:48.148 --> 42:49.733
[gentle music playing]

42:49.817 --> 42:51.569
[Donnie] No, at the beginning,
it was great.

42:51.652 --> 42:54.530
I mean, she was excited. We were excited.

42:54.613 --> 42:58.867
I mean, you could tell she, like,
wanted a father figure in her life.

42:58.951 --> 43:00.953
[inaudible]

43:02.413 --> 43:04.623
[Donnie] We all decided
to go to Disneyland.

43:05.291 --> 43:08.752
Daniel was there, and, you know,
I got to meet him, my nephew.

43:09.420 --> 43:12.756
And, uh… And he had
some blond, blond hair,

43:12.840 --> 43:14.383
just like I did, you know?

43:14.466 --> 43:17.094
I was like, "Wow! The kid looks
just like me when I was little."

43:17.177 --> 43:18.304
[chuckling] You know?

43:19.430 --> 43:20.723
It was a beautiful day.

43:21.974 --> 43:24.184
She wasn't getting along with her mother.

43:24.268 --> 43:26.645
You know,
that's why she got a hold of our father.

43:26.729 --> 43:29.481
You know,
everybody wants to look up to somebody.

43:31.317 --> 43:35.738
I just met my real father
for the first time in 24 years.

43:36.238 --> 43:38.198
[man] I never expected
it'd happen this late.

43:38.282 --> 43:41.535
You know, that many years gone by and, uh…

43:41.619 --> 43:43.996
Anyway, here she is, and here I am.

43:44.079 --> 43:47.124
And I think she's really done great
for herself.

43:47.207 --> 43:48.834
She's beautiful, and I love her.

43:49.335 --> 43:50.669
And I love you too.

43:51.503 --> 43:52.755
And he's my daddy.

43:54.214 --> 43:55.799
[dramatic music playing]

43:56.842 --> 43:59.094
[Donnie] We were, like, invited
to the Playboy Mansion.

43:59.178 --> 44:01.472
You know, I'm like, "You're kidding."

44:02.431 --> 44:07.102
And it was, like, a big party of, uh…
for her being Playmate of the Year.

44:07.603 --> 44:09.980
I remember, uh, meeting Hugh Hefner.

44:11.940 --> 44:17.529
Uh, he was giving her her gift,
which was a… a champagne-looking Jaguar.

44:18.781 --> 44:19.907
My dad was there too.

44:23.452 --> 44:26.163
[Marilyn] Looked a little
like Elvis Presley, I remember.

44:26.246 --> 44:29.416
Anna Nicole burst into my office saying,

44:29.500 --> 44:33.629
"My dad's here! My dad found me!"

44:33.712 --> 44:35.005
[Marilyn chuckling]

44:35.089 --> 44:37.800
She was over the moon with excitement.

44:38.801 --> 44:41.011
And she brought him in, and I met him.

44:41.095 --> 44:43.180
He seemed very nice, very polite.

44:44.556 --> 44:46.183
They left together.

44:46.266 --> 44:48.060
And then that was it.

44:48.143 --> 44:49.853
He never came back.

44:49.937 --> 44:54.608
So I don't honestly know
what ever happened to him.

44:55.859 --> 44:57.861
[ominous music playing]

45:01.407 --> 45:03.659
[Donnie] I wanted Vickie
to know the truth.

45:05.786 --> 45:10.624
My father is not a type of guy
you want to be alone with,

45:10.708 --> 45:12.793
or say… or… or feel safe.

45:12.876 --> 45:14.336
You're not gonna feel safe.

45:15.796 --> 45:18.215
I mean, he's… he's a monster.

45:18.298 --> 45:20.300
[crows cawing]

45:20.884 --> 45:24.638
[Donnie] I was about 16.

45:25.139 --> 45:26.473
He told me a story

45:27.641 --> 45:31.687
about how he, uh, raped his wife's sister.

45:33.397 --> 45:37.943
He chased her down by a tree
when his wife wasn't around.

45:39.069 --> 45:40.529
She was a child.

45:44.158 --> 45:45.492
He's very scary.

45:47.161 --> 45:49.163
Uh, I was always afraid of him.

45:50.330 --> 45:51.457
"I'll kill you dead."

45:51.540 --> 45:53.667
"I'll stomp your head
right in the ground."

45:53.751 --> 45:55.544
I mean, he's that type of person

45:55.627 --> 46:00.090
where he looks right at you,
and you really believe he will do that.

46:02.509 --> 46:04.595
And I just let her know straight up that…

46:05.596 --> 46:07.389
that, you know,
everything about him is true.

46:09.725 --> 46:11.810
[Missy] Nicky came back from Los Angeles,

46:11.894 --> 46:15.522
and I asked her
about her father and her brother,

46:15.606 --> 46:18.400
and she said
she didn't want to talk about it.

46:18.484 --> 46:22.404
Um, so we got--
When we were alone, um, on the plane,

46:22.488 --> 46:23.947
uh, she told me

46:24.031 --> 46:27.701
that, um, uh, her father had tried
to have sex with her.

46:28.911 --> 46:29.787
My dad?

46:30.954 --> 46:31.914
Assaulted her?

46:37.377 --> 46:39.338
No. I mean, it's…

46:39.421 --> 46:40.881
Uh, that would be like him.

46:42.633 --> 46:43.842
But is it true?

46:45.803 --> 46:46.887
It couldn't be.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.849
I was there every step of the way.

46:54.061 --> 46:56.772
But you know what?
I wouldn't put it past him. I mean…

46:56.855 --> 46:58.190
I guess, uh,

46:59.066 --> 47:00.776
guess I wasn't there all the time.

47:02.945 --> 47:03.987
So it could be true.

47:09.910 --> 47:13.831
[voice breaking] You could see it on,
and I was really sad to see that…

47:13.914 --> 47:15.290
[sucks teeth] …for her,

47:15.374 --> 47:17.960
because I know how happy she was when…

47:18.043 --> 47:19.878
when she met… you know, when she met him.

47:19.962 --> 47:22.673
'Cause she had all these, um,
ideas in her head

47:22.756 --> 47:25.259
of what he was like
and what it was gonna be like,

47:25.342 --> 47:27.636
and she was just so, so disappointed.

47:28.887 --> 47:31.014
-[man] Anna!
-[crowd clamoring]

47:31.098 --> 47:32.516
[dramatic music playing]

47:32.599 --> 47:33.642
[car horn honking]

47:33.725 --> 47:35.602
[camera shutters clicking]

47:35.686 --> 47:37.896
[reporter] Anna Nicole,
you been to Luther's lately?

47:37.980 --> 47:41.358
No, I haven't been to Luther's.
I haven't been anywhere.

47:41.441 --> 47:43.944
I went out with my friend tonight,
and that's it.

47:44.027 --> 47:45.195
[reporter] This isn't Houston.

47:45.279 --> 47:47.823
[Ligier] We had been seeing
Anna Nicole show up at various clubs

47:47.906 --> 47:49.533
with many different people,

47:49.616 --> 47:53.453
and then she shows up
with this young, blond guy…

47:53.537 --> 47:55.539
[camera shutters clicking]

47:56.915 --> 47:58.876
She was somewhat subdued with him,

47:58.959 --> 48:01.795
but she was showing him off
as her new boyfriend.

48:03.130 --> 48:04.172
Michael?

48:06.842 --> 48:08.135
Bye. Good night!

48:08.218 --> 48:09.803
[reporters clamoring]

48:11.597 --> 48:13.640
[siren wailing]

48:16.059 --> 48:19.563
[anchor] Model-turned-actress
Anna Nicole Smith has been hospitalized.

48:19.646 --> 48:21.189
Now, the story broke just hours ago.

48:21.273 --> 48:23.859
So right now,
there aren't a lot of details.

48:23.942 --> 48:25.944
[suspenseful music playing]

48:30.282 --> 48:31.617
[sirens wailing]

48:32.659 --> 48:35.329
[Ligier] Four months prior to Anna Nicole,

48:36.163 --> 48:39.124
River Phoenix, another actor,
had a drug overdose

48:39.207 --> 48:42.336
and died on the streets of Hollywood
right on the Sunset Strip.

48:42.419 --> 48:45.255
It was…
it was a trend that was starting to happen

48:45.339 --> 48:48.467
where people were taking
their partying too far.

48:48.550 --> 48:49.760
[sirens wailing]

48:50.802 --> 48:53.889
[Kevin] When the news came out, I think
a lot of people were initially shocked,

48:53.972 --> 48:58.101
um, you know, because drugs,
it's… it's not something…

48:58.185 --> 49:00.020
You don't automatically assume with her.

49:00.103 --> 49:02.773
I mean, she… she still had this persona,
of course,

49:02.856 --> 49:05.651
of the… of the girl next door from…
from Texas.

49:05.734 --> 49:07.903
So that shattered that illusion.

49:08.403 --> 49:10.822
It also made her more attractive to us,

49:10.906 --> 49:14.409
because, "Hey, there's some… there's some
dirt there that we can… we can go after."

49:14.493 --> 49:16.662
-[reporter] You got the camera?
-[reporter 2] Anna?

49:16.745 --> 49:18.580
Anna, can we get some pictures, dear?

49:18.664 --> 49:19.748
[reporters clamoring]

49:19.831 --> 49:21.959
[Anna] You know, I'm just one little girl.

49:22.042 --> 49:23.919
I'm just one little person,

49:24.002 --> 49:29.049
and I've got 50 things thrown at me,
and I'm like, "You know, what did I do?"

49:29.132 --> 49:33.804
"What did I ever do
but, you know, take pills?"

49:33.887 --> 49:37.015
Well, take pills and drink alcohol.
But I've never hurt anybody.

49:37.099 --> 49:40.560
[man] Let me ask you. Do you worry at all
about ever falling back into that?

49:40.644 --> 49:42.729
Oh, absolutely not.
It will never happen again.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.189
[laughing] I promise.

49:44.773 --> 49:46.358
No. Mm-mm.

49:46.441 --> 49:49.444
Well, I'm still seeing Nicky, my friend,

49:49.528 --> 49:54.658
and she's… she's really changing
in an exponential way at this point,

49:54.741 --> 49:58.412
because, uh,
she's, uh… she's now Anna Nicole Smith.

49:58.495 --> 49:59.705
[somber music playing]

49:59.788 --> 50:03.500
[Missy] And she's got these…
these important people calling her.

50:03.583 --> 50:06.962
She's got these Guess people calling.
She's got the Playboy people calling.

50:07.045 --> 50:08.880
She has all these obligations now.

50:08.964 --> 50:10.716
[camera shutter clicking]

50:10.799 --> 50:12.968
[Missy] And it just got overwhelming.

50:13.051 --> 50:15.762
She would show up to shoots
looking kinda haggard, and…

50:16.471 --> 50:18.640
and she would get called on the carpet
for it,

50:18.724 --> 50:21.018
and of course that adds more stress to it.

50:25.355 --> 50:27.816
I think a lot of the stress
that she was dealing with, too,

50:27.899 --> 50:30.318
came from the fact
that she was hiding this from Marshall.

50:30.402 --> 50:33.488
She was always scared
that it was gonna come out, you know?

50:33.572 --> 50:38.326
And so she's taking more and more
and more pills to… to relieve the stress.

50:38.410 --> 50:42.372
And I… I'm getting worried
about her, uh, state of mind,

50:42.456 --> 50:46.168
because I'm starting to notice changes
in her personality.

50:46.251 --> 50:51.423
Uh, she's getting to where, uh,
she's no longer grateful to Mr. Marshall.

50:51.506 --> 50:54.551
She's really treating him
like an ATM, kind of, now.

50:54.634 --> 50:57.220
So he gives her a credit card, and it's…

50:57.304 --> 51:00.098
He… He shares his personal credit card
with her,

51:00.182 --> 51:03.060
which has this ungodly limit on it,

51:03.143 --> 51:05.270
and she… she maxes it out.

51:05.353 --> 51:07.355
[ominous music playing]

51:08.065 --> 51:11.818
[Kelly] J. Howard's son, Pierce Marshall,
worked for his father.

51:11.902 --> 51:17.074
And even the one time
I heard Howard talking to Pierce,

51:17.157 --> 51:23.538
my sense is that Pierce had to endure
a lot of assaults on his dignity

51:23.622 --> 51:24.706
working for his father.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.297
And I think there was a lot of resentment
that Pierce had for his father

51:32.380 --> 51:35.092
and even more resentment
that Pierce had for Anna,

51:35.175 --> 51:38.845
that Anna was just gonna come along
this late in the game

51:38.929 --> 51:41.389
and take away from Pierce.

51:42.599 --> 51:44.935
The things that he had put up with,

51:45.685 --> 51:48.939
garbage from his father for years.

51:49.022 --> 51:51.566
And… And he wasn't gonna let it happen.

51:51.650 --> 51:53.151
He wasn't gonna let it happen.

51:56.613 --> 51:59.032
[Missy] Of course,
Mr. Marshall is spoiling her rotten,

51:59.116 --> 52:01.076
and Pierce is the one
who handled these things.

52:01.159 --> 52:04.955
So he sees all of this money
that's being plowed into her.

52:05.038 --> 52:05.914
[music fades]

52:06.706 --> 52:10.585
I felt like she was trying
to fill herself up with this stuff,

52:10.669 --> 52:13.713
because there was a hole
in her soul or her spirit,

52:13.797 --> 52:16.675
and she's trying to fill it up
with all this outside stuff,

52:16.758 --> 52:18.510
and it just… it was never gonna get full.

52:18.593 --> 52:21.930
I mean, all that does
is… is make you want more.

52:23.932 --> 52:25.934
[somber music playing]

52:50.417 --> 52:51.459
[machine beeping]

52:51.543 --> 52:53.253
[Marshall] This is your husband.

52:53.920 --> 52:54.754
Love you.

52:55.839 --> 52:57.299
I've been trying to find you.

52:58.175 --> 52:59.217
Please call me.

53:02.053 --> 53:03.013
[machine beeping]

53:06.308 --> 53:07.809
[Marshall] Please call your man.

53:08.852 --> 53:09.895
I love you.

53:12.272 --> 53:13.648
[machine beeping]

53:13.732 --> 53:15.901
[Marshall] This is your man…

53:15.984 --> 53:18.278
trying to find his lady fair.

53:19.696 --> 53:20.739
Love you.

53:21.448 --> 53:22.490
Please call me.

53:26.745 --> 53:27.871
[machine beeping]

53:30.123 --> 53:32.334
[Marshall] Your husband wants
to talk to you.

53:33.126 --> 53:34.377
Please call me.

53:35.212 --> 53:36.463
Love you dearly.

53:37.380 --> 53:38.465
[phone clicking]

53:39.883 --> 53:40.884
[machine beeping]

53:40.967 --> 53:41.968
[Anna] Hello?

53:42.052 --> 53:44.179
-[Marshall] Hello, dearest.
-[Anna] Hello.

53:44.262 --> 53:46.848
-[Marshall] Where are you?
-[Anna] I'm in bed.

53:46.932 --> 53:49.392
[Marshall] I've been trying to call you
for an hour.

53:49.976 --> 53:51.144
[Anna] You have?

53:51.228 --> 53:53.730
-[Marshall] Do you love your man?
-[Anna] Yes.

53:53.813 --> 53:56.024
[Marshall] Your man loves his lady fair.

53:56.107 --> 53:57.400
[Anna] Quit waking me up,

53:57.484 --> 53:59.778
or I'm gonna knock you out when I see you.

53:59.861 --> 54:01.571
[Marshall chuckles]
All right, dearest one.

54:02.405 --> 54:05.116
-[Anna] I love you.
-[Marshall] Take care, precious package.

54:05.200 --> 54:06.159
[Anna] Oh yeah.

54:06.243 --> 54:08.286
[Marshall] I told you
that my dream last night

54:08.370 --> 54:10.830
was that I'd been put on this Earth

54:11.373 --> 54:14.918
to try to make life better for you
than when you were young.

54:15.001 --> 54:16.795
[Anna] I know, honey.

54:16.878 --> 54:19.381
Tell me tomorrow. I'll forget tonight.

54:19.464 --> 54:21.007
[Marshall chuckles] All right, dearest.

54:21.091 --> 54:22.008
[Anna] Okay. Bye.

54:22.092 --> 54:24.636
-[Marshall] Take care, precious package.
-[Anna] I will.

54:24.719 --> 54:26.513
-[Marshall] Good night.
-[Anna] Good night.

54:26.596 --> 54:28.598
[somber music playing]

54:40.860 --> 54:42.779
[Missy] There came a point
where I realized

54:42.862 --> 54:46.241
that me being there
was not beneficial to her anymore.

54:46.324 --> 54:47.909
There was nothing I could do about it.

54:47.993 --> 54:50.328
I mean, and it's like banging your head
on the wall.

54:50.412 --> 54:52.914
And you're watching this person
that you love and care about

54:52.998 --> 54:56.251
morph into this thing that… that is just…

54:56.334 --> 54:59.462
just an egotistical monster
that is selfish.

55:00.672 --> 55:03.425
And she's a full-blown drug addict.
I mean, there's no way around it.

55:03.508 --> 55:05.343
She's taking a lot of drugs.

55:07.262 --> 55:09.848
I was busting my ass
to do everything I could to help her,

55:09.931 --> 55:12.309
and she just…
she didn't appreciate none of it.

55:12.892 --> 55:15.061
And after everything
we had been through, and…

55:15.145 --> 55:18.982
and the things I helped her do,
and the secrets I kept for her,

55:20.066 --> 55:22.068
I was hurt. You know, I was really hurt,

55:22.152 --> 55:25.071
because my friend that loved me
wasn't there anymore.

55:25.155 --> 55:29.576
She just… There was no compassion,
no nothing in that woman anymore for me.

55:31.286 --> 55:32.620
[seagulls warbling]

55:33.455 --> 55:34.914
[Missy] So, I just… I quit.

55:37.083 --> 55:39.669
I went home, and I didn't…
I was done. We were done.

55:39.753 --> 55:41.004
[music fades]

55:42.797 --> 55:44.257
[clock ticking]

55:44.341 --> 55:46.343
[somber music playing]

55:53.433 --> 55:56.353
[Kelly] A couple of months
into my representing Anna,

55:57.062 --> 55:59.397
Howard signed a trust agreement.

55:59.898 --> 56:04.069
It was an effort
to control his estate taxes,

56:04.152 --> 56:09.074
so he could use the money in the trust
for whatever he wanted to use it for

56:09.157 --> 56:10.200
until he died.

56:10.950 --> 56:13.578
But it didn't turn out to be that for him.

56:18.416 --> 56:21.586
Pierce worked behind the scenes

56:22.212 --> 56:25.840
and stripped Howard
of all control over his own assets,

56:25.924 --> 56:28.676
stripped Howard of control over his life.

56:30.970 --> 56:33.515
Howard had bought these beautiful…

56:34.099 --> 56:37.185
a… a necklace, a bracelet,
and a pair of earrings…

56:38.895 --> 56:40.021
and gave them to Anna.

56:40.105 --> 56:42.357
And they were worth
over a million dollars.

56:42.941 --> 56:45.902
All of a sudden,
Pierce was calling up and telling her,

56:46.653 --> 56:49.656
"You have to take the diamonds back.
I'm not going to pay for them."

56:49.739 --> 56:51.908
And that's how Howard found out

56:51.991 --> 56:54.994
that he no longer had control
over his own money.

56:56.162 --> 56:58.498
Howard called me, and he said,

56:59.582 --> 57:04.796
"The diamonds have to go back."
And he was so sad and so broken.

57:06.005 --> 57:07.966
[Marshall] This is Howard Marshall.

57:08.049 --> 57:13.513
I think my son Pierce
has overreached a little bit.

57:14.055 --> 57:18.643
He has no business
coming between my wife and myself.

57:19.978 --> 57:22.689
I want my wife…

57:24.482 --> 57:28.403
to be supported by me.

57:28.903 --> 57:30.655
She's the light of my life.

57:32.991 --> 57:35.994
I don't think
Pierce quite understands that,

57:36.578 --> 57:38.788
or maybe he's a little bit jealous.

57:40.415 --> 57:43.293
I want my wife taken care of.

57:45.712 --> 57:48.673
Howard went… went into a decline.

57:48.756 --> 57:50.884
His health started to fail at that moment.

57:51.551 --> 57:52.927
And Pierce,

57:54.262 --> 57:56.598
uh, stripped Anna's ability to go see him.

57:58.183 --> 58:02.145
They had to go to court in order
to get her access, visitation rights.

58:03.646 --> 58:07.901
What I saw from her was
how helpless and frustrated she felt.

58:08.443 --> 58:11.446
Um, and in the meantime,
she was losing everything.

58:14.991 --> 58:19.537
Anna always told me that J. Howard
had promised her half of his money.

58:21.998 --> 58:26.211
J. Howard Marshall, I think,
was worth about $1.6 billion.

58:28.171 --> 58:32.175
And once the case started,
nothing could stop it.

58:33.510 --> 58:35.512
[dramatic music playing]

58:41.601 --> 58:43.144
[Kelly] She probably had no idea,

58:43.228 --> 58:47.065
but she had Howard to protect her
when she came to Los Angeles.

58:47.148 --> 58:50.527
She had him
to hire the people that she needed

58:50.610 --> 58:54.072
to get the agents, and the PR people,
and all of the things that she needed,

58:54.155 --> 58:55.490
put all the pieces in place.

58:58.034 --> 59:02.080
So, she started out, uh, just roaring,

59:02.580 --> 59:05.917
and, uh, I guess she learned the hard way

59:06.000 --> 59:10.755
about the… the cruelty
that was waiting for her.

59:12.048 --> 59:13.550
[reporter] Anna, how're you holding up?

59:14.509 --> 59:16.469
[camera shutters clicking]

59:16.553 --> 59:19.097
It's kind of hard to comment right now.

59:19.180 --> 59:20.974
[anchor] With her court schedule,

59:21.057 --> 59:25.144
the grieving widow may not have time
to squeeze in many more photo shoots.

59:26.104 --> 59:27.188
[Kelly] She's under siege.

59:27.272 --> 59:30.149
She's been sued by many people

59:30.233 --> 59:33.861
who are trying to get their hands
on her husband's money.

59:33.945 --> 59:35.446
[man scoffing]

59:35.530 --> 59:36.614
[indistinct chatter]

59:39.200 --> 59:41.536
[anchor] Well, another crisis
for Anna Nicole Smith.

59:41.619 --> 59:42.662
She says she's broke.

59:42.745 --> 59:45.623
But there's more to the story
than just a shortage of cash.

59:45.707 --> 59:47.333
[camera shutters clicking]

59:47.417 --> 59:48.543
What are y'all doing here?

59:48.626 --> 59:50.378
[reporter] We're everywhere.
You know that.

59:50.461 --> 59:52.213
I came here to get rid of you guys…

59:52.297 --> 59:54.716
-[reporter] Don't say that!
-…so I could have a quiet evening.

59:54.799 --> 59:57.760
-[reporter 2] You're our favorite.
-[reporter] You'll hurt our feelings.

59:57.844 --> 01:00:00.513
I'm your favorite.
What you put in the paper is mean.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:03.474
[reporter] No! We didn't put anything!
We take great pictures!

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:07.020
No. Because you y'all turning this thing--
No. Let me make a statement.

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:08.730
-[reporter] Okay.
-Let me make a statement.

01:00:08.813 --> 01:00:12.066
I was being all sweet to you guys,
and y'all screwed me over.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.984
[reporter 1] No.

01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:15.361
-Yeah, y'all did.
-[reporter 2] We never tell them anything.

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:18.156
-[man] We can't help what TV people say.
-I love you guys.

01:00:18.239 --> 01:00:19.699
I will continue to love you guys

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:22.201
until y'all fuck with me
like you did the other night.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:24.162
[reporter] Thank you for supporting us.

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:26.372
[Anna] Put this in your paper.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.916
[reporter] Oh yeah, that's great.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.504
This is Anna Nicole at her best.
And I'm at my best, so…

01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:34.881
It's sad but true that, you know,

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:38.801
when someone does come off the rails
like this, and particularly with drugs,

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:41.054
people back away very quickly.

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:44.098
[sputtering] William Morris
dumped her as… as a client.

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:47.769
You… You had some fashion contracts
don't want to be associated with it.

01:00:47.852 --> 01:00:50.647
You know, no one really wants
to be that close to it.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.899
[reporter] Can we get
a couple of pictures, Anna?

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:55.526
[Kevin] So when you're actually
probably most in need,

01:00:55.610 --> 01:01:00.114
you're finding the people around you are…
are shying away and shooing you away.

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:01.824
-…get a couple pictures?
-[man] Go ahead.

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:04.160
-All right then.
-[man] Anna, please?

01:01:04.243 --> 01:01:06.245
[reporters clamoring]

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:08.206
[ominous music playing]

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:13.878
She kept looking
for somebody else to save her. [chuckling]

01:01:13.961 --> 01:01:15.505
[crowd clamoring]

01:01:17.256 --> 01:01:18.341
[woman] What are they doing?

01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:20.301
-Jim, get the car.
-[reporter] Anna, this way.

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:23.221
[Kelly] That's when Howard Stern came in.

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:26.808
[reporter] Anna, with the gentleman?
What's the gentleman…

01:01:26.891 --> 01:01:28.810
-The gentleman…
-[reporter] What's his name?

01:01:28.893 --> 01:01:30.395
The gentleman is Howard.

01:01:30.478 --> 01:01:31.979
-I'm her lawyer.
-And he's my lawyer.

01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:33.564
-[reporter] Oh, you're kidding me.
-No.

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:36.150
-So y'all are all fucked.
-[reporter] Oh, we're in trouble now!

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:42.573
Bizarrely, we… we knew him, because he had
an office in the same building as us,

01:01:42.657 --> 01:01:45.201
so occasionally, we would ride
in the elevator going up and down.

01:01:45.284 --> 01:01:46.703
[camera shutters clicking]

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:48.454
[indistinct chatter]

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:49.872
[Kevin] He learned how it worked.

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:52.709
And… And he also understood,
not just the publicity,

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.335
but the flow of money as well.

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:57.755
He knew, uh, how he could cash in on that.

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:00.508
[man talking indistinctly]

01:02:01.008 --> 01:02:03.010
[indistinct chatter]

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:07.724
Come on, Anna. Anna, that's enough.

01:02:08.933 --> 01:02:10.601
[reporter] It's right here.
It's right here.

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:15.314
[Kelly] My impression was
that he was kind of a low-level attorney,

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:17.066
who was looking for a big payday,

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:20.153
and he thought he was gonna move
into this established case,

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:22.363
take it over, and take the money.

01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:24.490
[indistinct chatter]

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:29.370
[RuPaul] You married the man.
He wanted you to have the money.

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:32.206
I know you can't talk about that.
Give her the damn money!

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:33.666
[audience cheering]

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.084
Show me the money!

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:39.380
Everyone in America really cares
about Anna, whether, uh, you know…

01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:41.466
A lot of people in the press slam her,

01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:45.052
but I tell you, go from house to house,
all over America, everybody loves her.

01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:47.388
Everybody has a soft spot
for the underdog.

01:02:47.472 --> 01:02:51.434
So I believe that Anna should get
whatever the hell she wants.

01:02:52.059 --> 01:02:53.686
-[chuckling] Thank you.
-It's true!

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.481
Just wish I could. [chuckling nervously]

01:02:56.981 --> 01:02:58.608
[camera shutter clicks]

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.781
[anchor] Anna Nicole Smith walked
into the courtroom

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:09.202
with a fuchsia knit sweater on
and a picture of her husband close by.

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:12.246
She took the witness stand
and talked about the love of her life.

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:16.125
He was just a brilliant, great,
wonderful, wonderful man

01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:18.127
that I loved deeply.

01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:23.049
It wasn't a sexual, "Baby, oh baby,
I love your body" type love.

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:27.720
It was a deep thank you
for taking me out of this hole,

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:32.391
and thank you
for saving my life and my son's life,

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.352
and thank you for taking care of us.

01:03:35.102 --> 01:03:38.356
That's the kind of love
that me and my husband had for each other.

01:03:39.273 --> 01:03:41.275
[melancholy music playing]

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:45.863
[man] He thought if he gave her
enough money during his lifetime,

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:49.700
I think he probably gave her $14 million
during the course of their relationship

01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:51.536
to try to get her in business
and everything,

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:55.998
she would ultimately have plenty
when he died.

01:03:56.082 --> 01:04:00.503
The month before he died,
he realized she was a totally lost cause.

01:04:00.586 --> 01:04:03.214
He'd given her all this money,
and she had none left.

01:04:03.881 --> 01:04:05.591
He loved her.
There's no question about that.

01:04:06.884 --> 01:04:10.847
But Pierce knew his father
did not promise her half of the estate.

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:14.141
And quite frankly,
we shouldn't give her a dime.

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:17.728
And the reason is
her entire case is built on a lie.

01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:22.024
[anchor] In court, Pierce Marshall's side
is predicting some bombshells.

01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:26.529
His lawyers say they will not be shy
about dredging through Anna Nicole's past.

01:04:28.072 --> 01:04:31.909
[Rusty] That jury,
13 out of 16 of them were women.

01:04:31.993 --> 01:04:33.160
[inaudible]

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:37.957
[Rusty] It was very clear that most women
were going to side with Anna Nicole,

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.667
at least as we started out.

01:04:40.167 --> 01:04:43.087
And the reason was
they believed and said to us,

01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:45.965
"Any man foolish enough
to put himself in that situation

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:47.884
deserves pretty much
whatever was gonna happen."

01:04:48.467 --> 01:04:52.054
And so, the whole goal
was to change that mindset.

01:05:00.771 --> 01:05:04.233
Going after her
was never going to be the right approach.

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:06.903
The better approach was always gonna be

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:09.864
let her reveal herself
through her own words.

01:05:10.531 --> 01:05:12.909
The jury has to reach their conclusion
on their own.

01:05:14.493 --> 01:05:15.369
Your Honor…

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:21.208
She's talking, and she's asking questions,
and she's crying and looking to the jury.

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:25.296
And of course, she's looking to nine women
who should be sympathetic to her.

01:05:25.379 --> 01:05:28.883
Well, I had seen a couple of movies
that she had made,

01:05:28.966 --> 01:05:32.845
which she would never have been,
in those movies, able to cry on demand.

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:35.514
So, honest to God, it was not prepared.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:38.601
It wasn't anticipated.
It just occurred to me. I go…

01:05:38.684 --> 01:05:39.727
Ms. Marshall…

01:05:40.519 --> 01:05:42.939
have you been taking new acting lessons?

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:44.690
[crying] Screw you, Rusty.

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.359
[people laughing]

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.486
And then we were off to the races.

01:05:48.569 --> 01:05:53.157
You gotta buy a gown. You gotta buy shoes.
You gotta, uh, pay hair and makeup.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:57.912
I mean, it's very expensive to be me.
I mean, it's terrible the things…

01:05:57.995 --> 01:05:59.538
[Rusty] She was giving answers

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:02.959
that the average person
would consider ludicrous.

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:04.293
[camera shutter clicking]

01:06:05.002 --> 01:06:06.754
And it did not matter

01:06:06.837 --> 01:06:12.051
whether it was alcohol,
or sex, or drugs, or food.

01:06:12.843 --> 01:06:13.928
She was a glutton.

01:06:15.596 --> 01:06:19.183
The verdict ends up
they answer all our questions favorably.

01:06:19.266 --> 01:06:21.894
Anna Nicole was found
not to be entitled to anything.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.646
She received nothing from the trial.

01:06:23.729 --> 01:06:26.399
So the verdict was a resounding victory
for Pierce.

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:32.446
[camera shutters clicking]

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:34.949
[Rusty] She didn't lose
because she was a gold digger.

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:37.910
She… She lost because of who she was.

01:06:38.744 --> 01:06:40.746
[camera shutters clicking]

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:15.197
[Anna, echoing] I would just advise people
just to follow their dreams, you know?

01:07:24.331 --> 01:07:25.541
They can come true.

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:32.715
I'm living proof.

Under the bed?

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:00.993
[Sharon] Wherever you wanna put it.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.620
[Ozzy] I'll put it under the bed.

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:07.833
[man] The Osbournes
was a massive hit for MTV.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:10.377
So the executives
at E! Entertainment realized,

01:08:10.461 --> 01:08:12.505
"Maybe we can do a reality show."

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:16.258
They knew Anna Nicole was someone
that their audience really liked.

01:08:16.342 --> 01:08:17.510
[seagulls warbling]

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:20.137
[Ashley] She said,
"They'll follow me night and day."

01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:22.765
"They'll just live in my house with me."

01:08:22.848 --> 01:08:26.060
"And everybody can be in it, Daniel and…"

01:08:26.143 --> 01:08:29.271
"Howard wants me to do it.
He… He'll be in it. And…"

01:08:29.855 --> 01:08:32.858
"Nobody's talking about me.
I'm not in the news at all right now."

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:36.320
"I wanted your advice.
What do you think? Think I should do it?"

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:41.534
And I said, "Well, no,
I don't think you should do it."

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:43.994
I mean, immediately, that was…
She said, "Why?"

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:48.374
I said, "Because they're gonna make money
by making fun of you."

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.210
She said, "Well,

01:08:52.419 --> 01:08:53.295
okay."

01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:56.799

and if I was in LA,
I would come to the house and hang out.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:02.948
Otherwise, we would talk on the phone
and things like that,

01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:05.910

to know, like,

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:10.664
how many really deep friendships Anna had.

01:10:11.665 --> 01:10:15.252
[man] Anna didn't need
a personal assistant. She needed a friend.

01:10:15.753 --> 01:10:20.090
Calling it a personal assistant
was more PC than saying…

"I'm not sure."

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:41.278

I don't wanna say
more so than Pol' and Anna.

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:47.576
But we had
that really intimate, special bond

that nobody could break.

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:50.746
Anna always made me feel that…

01:10:50.829 --> 01:10:53.207
that I was the only one
that she was talking to.

01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:55.876
She trusted me with information
and told me things

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.380
that you wouldn't think
she probably told hardly anybody.

01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:02.132
She didn't like to talk
about her childhood.

[wind whooshing]

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:09.807
She liked to talk

[Pol'] She would always tell me
about her mother.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.814
Anna Nicole hated her mother.

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:20.234
The only thing I knew
that Anna ever wanted to do

01:11:20.317 --> 01:11:22.444
was never to be like Virgie.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:26.448
She made sure that
she was there for Daniel all the time.

01:11:27.032 --> 01:11:29.618

01:11:34.039 --> 01:11:35.457
he was…

01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:38.794
everything I wasn't expecting.

01:11:38.877 --> 01:11:42.464
I was expecting a spoiled Hollywood brat.

[inaudible]

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:47.136
[Nathan] Daniel was smart. He was humble.

01:11:47.219 --> 01:11:50.514
I think he was getting
a lot of bullying at school.

01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:53.017
You know, like,
"I saw your mom's tits today."

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:55.853
Or whatever they would say
about his mom. And it's like… [chuckles]

[Anna] That's my son. Isn't he cute?

01:11:58.605 --> 01:12:01.442
[Nathan] And it made him shy away
from people.

01:12:02.526 --> 01:12:04.611
Nobody came over for him.

I think I've missed maybe one episode.

you know, the son…

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:16.749

for the son and the dog. [chuckling]

-I think they're both being abused.

Yeah. I feel that Anna Nicole…

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:28.635
I know she keeps saying
that she's not on anything.

01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:30.179
I think she is on something.

[Howard] And I also get that,

01:12:37.978 --> 01:12:39.938
for some reason,
she doesn't think she's heavy.

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:42.483
I would say
she weighs 300 pounds at least.

01:12:42.566 --> 01:12:46.278
I'll bet you 100 bucks she's not over 300,
but it's gonna be so close.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.197
I think she's probably 280 or 290.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.865
[Howard] All right, let's… let's do this.

The person who comes closest
within five pounds of her weight…

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:55.079
We'll have a pool.

01:12:55.162 --> 01:12:58.916
[woman] She was devastated
by what the media was saying about her.

01:12:58.999 --> 01:13:02.378
I mean, they were,
you know basically calling her a fat pig.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:08.217
She told me that basically
from the time she was going to Playboy

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:12.388
that… that literally
everybody was always telling her

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:13.472
she needed to lose weight.

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:15.182
She always needed to lose that weight.

01:13:15.265 --> 01:13:17.601
And so she ended up
having an eating disorder.

01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:21.772
She didn't see herself as beautiful.

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:24.733
Even in her own perfection,

01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:27.236
she didn't see herself as beautiful

01:13:27.319 --> 01:13:31.240
because she didn't feel beautiful inside.

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:34.743
-Temptation, it's tough to resist.
-[ominous music playing]

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:36.703
Ask anyone who's trying to diet.

01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:40.249
[announcer] Just one Dexatrim
controls your appetite all day.

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:42.835
A revolutionary weight-loss product

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:46.338
that just may be the weight-loss answer
we've all been looking for.

01:13:48.006 --> 01:13:51.552
[Bonnie] TrimSpa
was a diet supplement company.

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:55.597
They had created some diet pills

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:59.226
that, you know,
they negotiated Anna to represent.

01:13:59.309 --> 01:14:00.602
[Anna giggling]

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:04.022
[Bonnie] Anna wanted to lose weight.
I said, "Well, I'm gonna come over."

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:06.567
"We're gonna exercise.
We're gonna do yoga."

01:14:06.650 --> 01:14:07.734
She's like, "Okay."

01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:12.072
She probably lost
at least 25 to 30 pounds.

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:14.992
But then what happened was

01:14:15.075 --> 01:14:17.953
Anna was getting antsy,
and she wanted all the weight off.

01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:22.332
And about a month later,
the assistant called me up and said,

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:24.543
"You need to come over.
Please come over now."

01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:27.504
"I'm really, really worried about Anna."

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:33.135
Anna was in bed. She had no makeup on.

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:36.805
And there was a white ring,

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:40.767
I mean white, like a white sheet,
around her mouth.

01:14:41.268 --> 01:14:42.728
And it was dehydration.

01:14:42.811 --> 01:14:46.190
She hadn't eaten anything
since the day that I left.

01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:50.777
And she was drinking, like,
maybe two inches of water a day

01:14:50.861 --> 01:14:53.197
and taking, um…

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.573
[smack lips] …a diuretic.

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:57.242
And I said, "Can I get a doctor here?"

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:58.160
"No."

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:02.247
"You need intravenous.
Like, you need something." "No."

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:06.001
[anchor] She didn't look like
the glamour girl she tries to be. Her…

01:15:06.084 --> 01:15:08.045
[Bonnie] I mean, she could barely talk.

01:15:08.128 --> 01:15:10.130
[anchor] …and her lipstick looked
slopped on.

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:13.091
[Bonnie] I had water with a straw
that I was giving her.

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:15.177
[somber music playing]

01:15:16.094 --> 01:15:18.597
[Bonnie] And I'm like,
"You can never do this to yourself again

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.849
because you won't live the next time."

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:22.351
And she said, "I know."

01:15:23.977 --> 01:15:25.646
She said, "I know." [sniffling]

01:15:27.105 --> 01:15:28.774
[inaudible]

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:32.402
I know that that day,
that I saved Anna's life.

01:15:32.486 --> 01:15:33.529
I know I did.

01:15:35.572 --> 01:15:37.783
[inaudible]

01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:39.868
[ad music playing]

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:43.330
[rock music playing]

01:15:43.413 --> 01:15:44.748
Hi! Hi.

01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:45.999
[crowd clamoring]

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:48.710
Thank you. I'm back. [chuckling]

01:15:50.128 --> 01:15:51.338
[woman] You look unbelievable.

01:15:51.421 --> 01:15:54.258
-[man] Come on, Anna.
-[woman] You look amazing.

01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:56.385
[announcer] Get the attention you deserve.

01:15:56.468 --> 01:15:58.845
-[man] Over here, Anna!
-[man 2] Anna! How did you do it?

01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:01.056
TrimSpa, baby!

01:16:01.139 --> 01:16:04.476
[announcer] Anna,
the ultimate comeback. Make yours.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.896
1-800-TRIMSPA or Trimspa.com.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.273
[dramatic music playing]

01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:12.776
[camera shutters clicking]

01:16:14.152 --> 01:16:16.488
TrimSpa went crazy.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:18.574
-[reporters clamoring]
-[woman] Anna!

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:20.284
[Bonnie] That was her comeback.

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:23.245
[man] Just one per person.

01:16:23.328 --> 01:16:25.539
Okay, one per person, guys.
One per person.

01:16:26.164 --> 01:16:27.416
[man 2] Anna.

01:16:27.499 --> 01:16:28.959
[indistinct chatter]

01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:34.590
[man] My name is Maurice Brighthaupt.

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:36.508
People know me as Big Moe.

01:16:37.175 --> 01:16:40.637
And I was Anna Nicole Smith's bodyguard.

01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:45.225
In the beginning, I think she tested me

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:47.894
to see if I was trustworthy
to be with her.

01:16:49.187 --> 01:16:52.608
She'd say, "You… Do you like my body?
You think I'm beautiful?"

01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:56.111
"Would you like to, you know,
see where we can go with this?"

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:58.572
And I looked at her
dead in the eye and said,

01:16:58.655 --> 01:17:01.908
"Right now, I really think of you
as a little sister."

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:05.245
And she shed a little tear.
She said, "You know what?"

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:07.456
"I'm so glad I met you."

01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:12.711
After about two days of working with her,
I started calling her baby girl.

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:15.339
And from that point on,
she called me Momo.

01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:17.466
[reporter 1] Get back. Get back. Anna!

01:17:17.549 --> 01:17:19.301
[crowd clamoring]

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:21.637
[reporter 2] Anna! Way over here!

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:22.721
[reporter 3] Anna!

01:17:23.513 --> 01:17:26.099
[Maurice] She had to present Kanye West
with the award

01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:28.352
at the American Music Awards.

01:17:28.435 --> 01:17:32.939
And before she went on stage,
Howard and her was talking,

01:17:33.023 --> 01:17:36.818
and I said, "This is gonna be great.
You're gonna be on stage."

01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:41.531
"Be yourself."

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:44.284
And that's when she sat back and thought,

01:17:45.369 --> 01:17:49.665
"Wow, I'm going to do something
that everyone will always remember."

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:52.042
[announcer] Anna Nicole Smith.

01:17:52.125 --> 01:17:53.710
[crowd cheering, applauding]

01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:55.545
[show music playing]

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:57.673
[Maurice] She got up on stage

01:17:57.756 --> 01:18:00.258
and looked like
maybe a little high or drunk.

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:06.014
That was Anna.
Anna knew how to work the crowd.

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:07.724
[crowd cheering]

01:18:07.808 --> 01:18:14.690
[slurring] And if I ever record an album,
I want this guy to produce mine.

01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:19.069
Make me beautiful duets!

01:18:19.736 --> 01:18:24.491
'Cause he's freaking genius!

01:18:24.574 --> 01:18:26.576
[crowd cheering loudly]

01:18:31.081 --> 01:18:35.043
[Maurice] Once she got off the stage,
the first thing she did, looked at Howard,

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:36.545
"How did I do?"

01:18:38.839 --> 01:18:41.425
Off the camera,
and we was all by ourselves,

01:18:41.508 --> 01:18:42.759
Anna was with it.

01:18:42.843 --> 01:18:44.761
-[reporters clamoring]
-[camera shutters clicking]

01:18:44.845 --> 01:18:45.887
[Maurice] And after that,

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:49.307
we got so many other speaking engagements
to go to.

01:18:50.308 --> 01:18:52.018
[Anna] It's crazy.

01:18:52.644 --> 01:18:54.229
It's totally crazy.

01:18:54.312 --> 01:18:58.483
Everyone out of the blue is calling.
Calling, calling, calling.

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:01.987
And I didn't even have to do a…
a sex tape.

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:04.030
And I'm getting all this attention,

01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:06.158
and I'm like, "Oh my God."

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:11.163
I'm like, "Wow!
I should, like, flub a line more often."

01:19:11.246 --> 01:19:13.540
[chuckling] It's like, "Whoa!"

01:19:15.041 --> 01:19:17.419
[Maurice] Everything would go
through Howard.

01:19:17.502 --> 01:19:22.549
But ultimately, it was her decision
whether or not she would take the offers.

01:19:24.342 --> 01:19:25.761
Anna knew how to work it.

01:19:25.844 --> 01:19:27.471
[inaudible]

01:19:28.054 --> 01:19:29.639
[Maurice] There's a saying out there

01:19:29.723 --> 01:19:32.142
that said that Howard
was controlling everything.

01:19:32.225 --> 01:19:33.977
[inaudible]

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.438
Howard did not control everything.

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.566
Anna was in control of everything.

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:44.196
If she thought that anybody
was trying to control her,

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:46.490
she would get rid of them, point-blank.

01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:48.909
[bell ringing]

01:19:48.992 --> 01:19:51.411
-[gun firing]
-[announcer speaking indistinctly]

01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:53.079
[horses galloping]

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:55.665
[dramatic music playing]

01:19:56.541 --> 01:19:57.584
[man laughing]

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:01.755
[Kevin] Larry Birkhead was a photographer

01:20:01.838 --> 01:20:05.133
and met Anna Nicole for the first time
at the Kentucky Derby.

01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:06.092
Kiss me.

01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:08.720
[Kevin] He was extremely polite.

01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:11.223
That's going above the bed,
right there. [laughs]

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:16.102
Larry knew already the power
of the celebrity pictures.

01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:17.729
[camera shutter clicking]

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:19.981
And so as soon as
he met Anna Nicole Smith,

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:21.650
the light bulb went off above his head,

01:20:21.733 --> 01:20:24.444
and he was like,
"Ooh, this could be quite lucrative."

01:20:29.616 --> 01:20:34.663
I met Larry Birkhead for the first time
when they all came to New York City.

01:20:34.746 --> 01:20:40.043
And Larry was there and… and kind of
introduced as her photographer…

01:20:40.126 --> 01:20:41.127
[inhales deeply]

01:20:41.211 --> 01:20:44.130
…but it was pretty obvious
that he was maybe more than that.

01:20:44.756 --> 01:20:48.718
And I also knew
that she was, at that time,

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:51.763
kind of wanting to be pregnant
and to have a baby.

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:55.183
So, my mind of course went there to,

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:59.521
"Oh, this is probably
who she hopes will father her child."

01:20:59.604 --> 01:21:00.605
[camera shutter clicking]

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:03.400
I was in LA for something,
and I went to visit.

01:21:03.483 --> 01:21:07.863
He was kind of there,
and they were trying to have a child.

01:21:07.946 --> 01:21:11.992
Um, but he wasn't staying in her room.
He was kind of… kind of had his own room.

01:21:12.576 --> 01:21:14.619
Um… [scoffing] …yeah.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:17.289
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[somber music playing]

01:21:17.998 --> 01:21:23.670
[Mitchell] But I heard the details
of what she was looking for in a father.

01:21:25.463 --> 01:21:28.425
Like, "You won't have visitation rights,
or be paid money,

01:21:28.508 --> 01:21:31.553
or be able to legally say
that the child is yours."

01:21:31.636 --> 01:21:34.389
There were some pretty strict parameters

01:21:34.472 --> 01:21:39.227
surrounding, um, you know,
her having a child with somebody.

01:21:43.607 --> 01:21:47.360
So I figured he was on that same page.

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:56.745
[light switch clicking]

01:21:57.370 --> 01:21:58.455
[objects clattering]

01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:06.379
[man] In 2004,
I took over a practice in Studio City.

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:08.256
[footsteps approaching]

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.507
[door opening]

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:11.468
[door closing]

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:15.555
I was really not interested
in… in a celebrity practice.

01:22:15.639 --> 01:22:18.016
I mean, you know,
most of my patients were older.

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:23.229
The doctor before me said,
"Have you heard of Anna Nicole Smith?"

01:22:23.313 --> 01:22:25.190
"I see her for chronic pain."

01:22:25.815 --> 01:22:27.943
"She's very, um, manipulative,

01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:32.656
and she's… and she can charm you and try--
Just don't get caught in that."

01:22:33.365 --> 01:22:35.158
[contemplative music playing]

01:22:35.241 --> 01:22:37.577
[Dr. Kapoor] She had had many ailments
over the past,

01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:41.289
including various things
like fibromyalgia.

01:22:41.373 --> 01:22:45.210
Um, uh, she'd had significant, like,
different back pains.

01:22:47.504 --> 01:22:49.255
She had some chest pain.

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:53.593
A breast implant that was ruptured
and had to be repaired.

01:22:56.054 --> 01:23:01.768
And when there was, uh, emotional issues
that were happening to her,

01:23:01.851 --> 01:23:03.603
um, her pain was worse.

01:23:03.687 --> 01:23:04.562
[reporter] Anna.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:06.064
[reporters clamoring]

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:07.816
[Dr. Kapoor] What you see
in the public eye

01:23:07.899 --> 01:23:10.819
is this bubbly, vivacious,

01:23:10.902 --> 01:23:13.822
uh, this, you know,
bombshell type of thing.

01:23:13.905 --> 01:23:16.366
But behind the scenes, um,

01:23:17.409 --> 01:23:19.077
it's a different story.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.495
[man laughing]

01:23:21.454 --> 01:23:22.789
[Dr. Kapoor] She was on methadone,

01:23:22.872 --> 01:23:25.667
which was the pain medicine
that worked for her.

01:23:27.293 --> 01:23:30.255
This is a medicine that is…
is, uh, always known

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:33.049
as people that are addicted to heroin.

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:36.803
So people would look at it and say,
"Well, she must've been a heroin addict."

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:46.479
She said,
"Um, don't worry about the doses."

01:23:46.563 --> 01:23:49.607
"I'm like a horse.
I can take a lot of medicine."

01:23:51.901 --> 01:23:54.487
"It takes me a lot to have the effect."

01:23:59.617 --> 01:24:00.452
[dog barking]

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:04.998
Hi, it's me, Anna Nicole, as you can see.

01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:08.293
I've been hearing a lot of gossip
in the papers.

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:12.714
"Is Anna pregnant? She's pregnant.
She's pregnant by some guy."

01:24:14.174 --> 01:24:17.343
Well, let me stop all the rumors.

01:24:17.427 --> 01:24:20.055
Yes, I am pregnant.

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:23.475
I, uh, I'm happy.

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:25.351
I'm very, very happy about it.

01:24:25.435 --> 01:24:27.729
I'll let you see me as I'm growing.

01:24:27.812 --> 01:24:30.690
So, that's it at this time.

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:32.233
Bye.

01:24:32.984 --> 01:24:34.360
[suspenseful music playing]

01:24:34.444 --> 01:24:36.821
So one day, Anna sent me an email,

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:41.159
and she said,
"Guess what? You're gonna be an aunt!"

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:42.702
[Mitchell laughing]

01:24:42.786 --> 01:24:47.624
So she said,
"Howard, you can be the father."

01:24:47.707 --> 01:24:49.084
"We'll do this together."

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:52.462
Just think of how beautifully that worked.

01:24:52.545 --> 01:24:54.214
I mean, this is her attorney,

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:56.841
who is a friend.

01:24:56.925 --> 01:24:58.927
You know, not a lover, but a friend.

01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:01.679
And, um… And they're going to--

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:03.598
They have obviously a really strong bond,

01:25:03.681 --> 01:25:05.517
and they're gonna continue
to have a strong bond

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.728
as they work together
through all kinds of legal challenges.

01:25:08.812 --> 01:25:14.692
So it made perfect sense
for that to be the ultimate storyline.

01:25:15.693 --> 01:25:18.571
I think my parents
were a little shocked. [laughing]

01:25:19.405 --> 01:25:20.365
You know, um…?

01:25:22.242 --> 01:25:25.995
Because Howard never, that I'm aware of,

01:25:26.079 --> 01:25:29.541
never said to my parents,
"I'm having a relationship with Anna."

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:33.128
You know?
Like, I don't think they knew that.

01:25:35.171 --> 01:25:39.425
My mom, like, being a grandmother,
was, like, that was her pride and joy.

01:25:46.057 --> 01:25:47.475
[music fades]

01:25:47.559 --> 01:25:49.561
[sirens wailing]

01:25:55.066 --> 01:25:58.528
[Nathan] I was at my apartment
in West Hollywood.

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.198
I'm having a Kylie Minogue
birthday party. [chuckling]

01:26:03.575 --> 01:26:07.162
I'm a huge Kylie fan,
so that day is very important to me,

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:09.581
and I try to throw a party when I can.

01:26:11.374 --> 01:26:13.376
[electro-pop music playing]

01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:16.421
[Nathan] And just like every party
in Hollywood,

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:18.965
there was alcohol, and there was cocaine,

01:26:19.048 --> 01:26:21.384
and we were just having a good time.

01:26:21.467 --> 01:26:23.094
[indistinct chatter]

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:26.472
[Nathan] And Daniel comes over.

01:26:27.098 --> 01:26:31.186
"Hey. You wanna have a drink?"
He's like, "I wanna have everything."

01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:34.856
[chuckling] I was like,
"Where… Where did this come from?"

01:26:35.481 --> 01:26:36.733
[tense music playing]

01:26:36.816 --> 01:26:38.318
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

01:26:38.401 --> 01:26:40.403
[Nathan] Daniel never drank. [chuckling]

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:42.906
I never saw him drink.

01:26:42.989 --> 01:26:48.661
Maybe, I mean, one beer
every two weeks or three weeks or…

01:26:48.745 --> 01:26:49.746
It was very rare.

01:26:50.955 --> 01:26:53.208
Fast-forward to May.

01:26:53.917 --> 01:26:55.001
He's drinking.

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:59.130
He's doing cocaine. He's doing pills.

01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:01.841
He was… I think he was about to turn 21.

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:07.639
Personality-wise,
I had noticed that he had…

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:13.311
kind of changed.

01:27:13.394 --> 01:27:16.981
Like, it was a little bit more
of an edgier, darker side of Daniel

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:18.358
that I hadn't seen before.

01:27:19.859 --> 01:27:23.238
I think… I think I offered him a drink,
and he was just like…

01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:27.575
He said, "Can I drink on some methadone?"

01:27:27.659 --> 01:27:30.245
And I was like, "Where did you get
the methadone?" [chuckles]

01:27:30.328 --> 01:27:34.666
I'm like, "Did you take it from your mom?"
And he said… He was like, "Yeah."

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:40.004
I'm like, "First of all,
how much did you take?" [chuckling]

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:42.548
He's like… He's like, "I just took one.
I just…"

01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:44.717
[Nathan sighing heavily]

01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:46.970
I mean, honestly… [chuckling]

01:27:47.053 --> 01:27:48.763
[inhales deeply]

01:27:48.846 --> 01:27:50.014
…it sounds stupid,

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:54.811
because I was at a party
with cocaine and alcohol. [chuckles]

01:27:54.894 --> 01:27:58.398
"You shouldn't be doing methadone,
but here have some cocaine."

01:27:58.481 --> 01:27:59.983
Um, it…

01:28:00.066 --> 01:28:04.028
You know, it's just one of those things
like, "God, be careful. I can't…"

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:07.448
You know, "Stop doing that,
but here have some cocaine." [chuckles]

01:28:08.533 --> 01:28:09.742
[sighing heavily]

01:28:12.787 --> 01:28:15.790
[Nathan] You know, young and dumb,
but I was really worried.

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:17.959
[crowd cheering]

01:28:18.042 --> 01:28:20.044
[ominous music playing]

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:26.551
[music fades]

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:29.470
[anchor] Former Playboy Playmate
Anna Nicole Smith's bid

01:28:29.554 --> 01:28:32.056
to get part of her late husband's fortune
has new life today,

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:36.477
thanks to a very unlikely group of allies,
the Supreme Court.

01:28:37.228 --> 01:28:41.149
[anchor 2] The high court has agreed
to hear the ex-Playboy model's case.

01:28:41.232 --> 01:28:44.569
She's claiming millions of dollars
from her dead husband's estate.

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:45.987
[tense music playing]

01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:47.447
[computer chiming]

01:28:47.530 --> 01:28:51.367
Whenever I would be on, um, AOL,
I would see a box,

01:28:51.451 --> 01:28:54.370
people who were on there,
and her name was Hot Smoochie Lips.

01:28:54.454 --> 01:28:56.539
[computer trilling]

01:28:56.622 --> 01:28:58.833
[Mitchell] So Anna had sent me
an instant message,

01:28:58.916 --> 01:29:01.169
and she was referring to Larry.

01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:03.463
[keyboard clacking]

01:29:06.466 --> 01:29:07.383
[computer chiming]

01:29:09.635 --> 01:29:11.387
[keyboard clacking]

01:29:14.223 --> 01:29:15.141
[computer chiming]

01:29:17.268 --> 01:29:19.270
[computer chiming]

01:29:22.315 --> 01:29:23.232
[computer chiming]

01:29:23.316 --> 01:29:25.902
[Mitchell] It was really clear
that Anna Nicole did not want

01:29:25.985 --> 01:29:27.737
to share custody with somebody else.

01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:30.531
She just wanted the child,
no strings attached,

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:34.452
and the best way to do that
was to maybe escape the States

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:36.079
and… and do this elsewhere.

01:29:45.505 --> 01:29:47.173
[music fades]

01:29:48.341 --> 01:29:50.635
[Pol'] Anna never wanted anything
from Larry.

01:29:51.552 --> 01:29:53.471
Anna wanted Larry to leave her alone.

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:57.767
The truth is

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.520
she couldn't stand him.

01:30:02.438 --> 01:30:05.024
-[melancholy music playing]
-[seagulls warbling]

01:30:17.036 --> 01:30:19.247
[Mitchell] The Bahamas
would be her fresh start.

01:30:19.330 --> 01:30:22.917
This was her chance
to raise the baby all by herself…

01:30:26.003 --> 01:30:28.506
and do it the way
that she wanted it to be done

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:31.259
and the way she wished
she could've done for Daniel.

01:30:44.063 --> 01:30:49.652
In the Bahamas, there is, um,
a few interesting legalities.

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:51.863
One being that

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:57.118
whoever signed the birth certificate
in the Bahamas is the father.

01:30:57.201 --> 01:30:59.203
That's how they see it.

01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:04.375
And so if Howard K. Stern signs that,
then he's the legal father. The end.

01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:14.218
[Dr. Kapoor] Anna called me
in late August,

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:19.891
and she had just informed me on the phone
that she has moved to the Bahamas.

01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:29.901
And I said, "Well what about your care…
you know, care?"

01:31:29.984 --> 01:31:33.321
"Um, well, I'm… I'm here,
and it's a beautiful place,

01:31:33.404 --> 01:31:35.490
and it's really relaxing,"
and all this stuff.

01:31:35.573 --> 01:31:37.366
I said, "Well, you know--"

01:31:37.450 --> 01:31:40.745
And then,
she also was calling really to say,

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:42.997
"I'm gonna run out of my methadone."

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.582
[seagulls warbling]

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:50.129
[Dr. Kapoor] That can result
in withdrawals, which can be deadly,

01:31:50.213 --> 01:31:51.881
and I was worried about the baby.

01:31:53.382 --> 01:31:55.551
And I checked to see

01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:59.972
if, you know, you could even get methadone
in the Bahamas,

01:32:00.056 --> 01:32:01.599
and there was absolutely no way.

01:32:03.518 --> 01:32:06.103
So I called the pharmacy.

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:09.899
"She needs to have this medicine.
She only has a couple of days left."

01:32:09.982 --> 01:32:11.234
I said, "What can I do?"

01:32:11.317 --> 01:32:12.443
[somber music playing]

01:32:12.527 --> 01:32:13.778
So the decision was made.

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:19.116
We're going to try to get it
to her in the Bahamas from here.

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:22.203
And, um, she got her methadone.

01:32:24.664 --> 01:32:26.624
And then, Daniel came to see me

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:30.503
and was saying that he
and his mother were not getting along.

01:32:31.796 --> 01:32:37.927
He seemed anxious
and somewhat irritated by the situation.

01:32:39.929 --> 01:32:42.932
And he was struggling
with some issues of depression.

01:32:43.558 --> 01:32:48.563
And so he ended up being admitted
to a hospital.

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:50.940
He was seen by a psychiatrist

01:32:51.023 --> 01:32:55.528
who started him on the medicine Lexapro
before he was discharged home.

01:32:55.611 --> 01:32:57.238
[ominous music playing]

01:32:57.989 --> 01:33:01.993
[Dr. Kapoor] I said, "You need
to come back and take care of him."

01:33:06.330 --> 01:33:09.500
I don't know if she realized
that, um, he was…

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:12.169
the gravity of what he was going through.

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:14.255
[unnerving music playing]

01:33:15.715 --> 01:33:17.717
[baby crying]

01:33:19.385 --> 01:33:20.344
[music fades]

01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:22.471
I was called by Howard

01:33:22.555 --> 01:33:26.392
and told that she just delivered
a bouncing baby girl,

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:30.980
and she's, uh, she looks beautiful.

01:33:31.063 --> 01:33:33.357
And I… I said, "Can I speak to Anna?"

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:38.446
She said, "Momo, the baby's beautiful
and all I ever… what I ever wanted."

01:33:38.529 --> 01:33:42.033
Then she told me, she says,
"Well, Daniel's on his way."

01:33:42.116 --> 01:33:44.493
Whew! Wow. Okay, we got them together.

01:33:44.577 --> 01:33:45.995
They're… They're talking.

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:55.338
She sent the plane ticket,
and he's on his way.

01:33:56.964 --> 01:33:58.966
[somber music playing]

01:34:05.014 --> 01:34:06.849
[birds chirping]

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.812
[seagulls warbling]

01:34:32.208 --> 01:34:33.668
[music fades]

01:34:33.751 --> 01:34:35.127
[phone ringing]

01:34:43.594 --> 01:34:44.679
[receiver clicking]

01:34:44.762 --> 01:34:46.514
[Maurice] I got
an out-of-state phone call,

01:34:46.597 --> 01:34:48.849
and I looked and said,
"Oh man, this is the Bahamas."

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:55.314
And it was Howard on the phone,
very somber, soft, uh, tone in his voice.

01:34:55.398 --> 01:34:59.068
He said, "Uh, Mo, uh,
Anna needs you really bad."

01:34:59.151 --> 01:35:05.074
Then I could hear Anna in the background,
"Momo, come now! Momo, come now."

01:35:05.157 --> 01:35:07.535
So I… I said… I said, "What's going on?"

01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:10.162
He said, "Uh, Daniel just died."

01:35:10.913 --> 01:35:12.331
[waves crashing]

01:35:15.835 --> 01:35:17.044
[Maurice] I said, "What?

01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:19.755
What do you mean, 'just died'?"

01:35:20.464 --> 01:35:24.301
He said, "Yeah. He saw his sister,

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:26.846
then never woke up."

01:35:26.929 --> 01:35:27.763
And…

01:35:29.223 --> 01:35:30.266
"He's gone."

01:35:33.978 --> 01:35:37.356
[spokesperson] Daniel Wayne Smith arrived
at the hospital late evening

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.275
on Saturday, September 9th

01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:44.363
and remained as a visitor
with his mother and newly-born sister.

01:35:45.281 --> 01:35:49.493
On Sunday, at 9:38 a.m.,
the nurse was called,

01:35:50.119 --> 01:35:53.497
following which physicians on the floor
were immediately summoned.

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:55.124
[somber music playing]

01:35:55.207 --> 01:35:59.003
[spokesperson] Resuscitative efforts using
advanced life-support protocol

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:01.005
continued for 22 minutes.

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:04.842
He was pronounced dead at 10:05 a.m.

01:36:06.218 --> 01:36:09.847
We would like to extend
our sincerest condolences

01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:13.100
to the family and the friends
of Daniel Wayne Smith,

01:36:13.768 --> 01:36:15.603
and we encourage the press

01:36:15.686 --> 01:36:18.773
to please be sensitive
to the family's loss

01:36:18.856 --> 01:36:23.068
and give them the opportunity
to grieve during this time.

01:36:30.785 --> 01:36:31.994
[Pol'] She was a wreck.

01:36:33.412 --> 01:36:34.830
She was incoherent.

01:36:35.331 --> 01:36:36.582
She couldn't talk.

01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:40.085
She didn't wanna live.

01:36:41.754 --> 01:36:45.132
Daniel was the reason
why she wanted to get out of Mexia, Texas.

01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:49.720
Everything that she did was for Daniel.

01:36:54.266 --> 01:36:56.644
[somber music continues]

01:37:09.448 --> 01:37:13.202
[Pol'] Every single conversation
was what she did wrong,

01:37:13.285 --> 01:37:15.079
blamed herself the whole time.

01:37:17.998 --> 01:37:18.874
[music fades]

01:37:18.958 --> 01:37:20.668
She said, "I just wanna die."

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:25.631
"I don't deserve to be here.
It should've been me."

01:37:25.714 --> 01:37:27.424
"It should have never been him."

01:37:29.885 --> 01:37:31.470
[voice breaking] "It should've been me."

01:37:38.143 --> 01:37:42.356
Tonight, the sudden and unexpected death
of a young man, just 20 years old,

01:37:42.439 --> 01:37:43.732
under investigation.

01:37:44.775 --> 01:37:46.986
Twenty-year-old Daniel Smith,

01:37:47.069 --> 01:37:51.740
his death, his sudden and unexpected death
there in a Bahaman hospital,

01:37:51.824 --> 01:37:53.367
was it murder?

01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:55.911
[unnerving music playing]

01:37:55.995 --> 01:37:59.373
[anchor] Rumors continue to swirl
about the strange and sudden death

01:37:59.456 --> 01:38:01.417
of Anna Nicole Smith's son Daniel.

01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:04.545
As new evidence of an overdose emerges,

01:38:04.628 --> 01:38:09.049
we ask, could this be an accident
or even suicide?

01:38:09.133 --> 01:38:10.467
[camera shutters clicking]

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:14.805
[Pol'] We're surrounded
with more than 300 paparazzi.

01:38:14.889 --> 01:38:21.770
The front and the side is barricaded
with photographers, international.

01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:27.359
Cameras sticking up over the wall…

01:38:28.861 --> 01:38:30.613
to see her devastation.

01:38:30.696 --> 01:38:32.698
[somber music playing]

01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:36.660
[Maurice] Every time she wakes up,
"Daniel's calling me."

01:38:37.244 --> 01:38:40.789
"Daniel wants me there.
Daniel wants me there."

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:47.671
I would bring Dannielynn to her and said,
"This is the reason why you must live on."

01:38:48.964 --> 01:38:51.300
Her whole mentality would change.

01:38:52.593 --> 01:38:54.261
She would sit there, smile,

01:38:55.429 --> 01:38:57.848
and look at the baby, and say,
"You're just an angel."

01:38:57.932 --> 01:39:00.267
And I said,
"See, this is why you must live."

01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:06.106
But she wanted to be with Daniel
all the time.

01:39:10.736 --> 01:39:13.447
Because every time she would sleep,
she would see him.

01:39:13.530 --> 01:39:16.200
Mom! Mom!

01:39:17.868 --> 01:39:20.829
And that's why I believe
that she always liked to be sedated

01:39:20.913 --> 01:39:23.415
and taking these pills
that will help her sleep.

01:39:26.251 --> 01:39:28.337
Every dream, Daniel was there.

01:39:32.049 --> 01:39:36.845
Most of the people that was around her
was enabling her.

01:39:37.471 --> 01:39:40.641
She says, "Howard, I want you
to give me all these pills,

01:39:40.724 --> 01:39:44.687
and you either give them to me,
or I'll find somebody else that do."

01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:48.565
It ain't like Howard says,
"You have to take all these pills."

01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:51.068
Howard would never do that.

01:39:53.696 --> 01:39:55.364
She didn't need enablers.

01:40:03.414 --> 01:40:05.207
[anchor] This is a time of great joy
for her.

01:40:05.290 --> 01:40:07.418
She's bringing a new child into the world.

01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:09.670
And at the time of her greatest joy,

01:40:09.753 --> 01:40:12.214
something happens
to her 20-year-old child.

01:40:12.297 --> 01:40:15.342
That is going to make her
feel tremendously guilty.

[Larry] Thanks, everybody, for coming.
And I just want to say

01:40:42.327 --> 01:40:45.414
that, um, I am the father of Dannielynn,

01:40:45.497 --> 01:40:47.666
and I think this is, um,

01:40:48.584 --> 01:40:51.253
a crime, basically,
what these people are doing to me.

01:40:51.336 --> 01:40:54.798
And I expect to be reunited
with my daughter,

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:57.301
uh, with the help
of my attorney, Mrs. Opri.

01:40:57.384 --> 01:40:58.677
Thank you all for coming.

If this man has anything to say about it,

[anchor 2] Dannielynn could inherit
millions of dollars

01:41:07.186 --> 01:41:12.024
from the estate of Smith's late husband,
oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall.

01:41:12.107 --> 01:41:14.068
[anchor 3] Why has Anna Nicole
been so secretive

01:41:14.151 --> 01:41:16.695
about who the father
of her new daughter is?

01:41:16.779 --> 01:41:21.784
Uh, Anna and I have, um,
been in a relationship,

01:41:21.867 --> 01:41:23.577
and we love each other,

01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:26.872
and it's been going on
for a very long time.

01:41:26.955 --> 01:41:28.290
So you are the father?

01:41:29.666 --> 01:41:30.501
Yes, sir.

01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:34.630
[Larry King] By the way, have there been
any DNA tests taken? Is that--

-[Stern] Proud father.
-[Larry King] What?

01:41:37.466 --> 01:41:39.259
[Stern] I said, "Proud father."

01:41:39.343 --> 01:41:42.221
[anchor] Attorney Howard K. Stern says
he's the father.

Ex-boyfriend Larry Birkhead says
the child is his,

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:47.893
and in the zaniest moment of the day,

01:41:47.976 --> 01:41:51.355
Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband,
Prinz Frédéric von Anhalt,

01:41:51.438 --> 01:41:53.440
hinted even he could be involved.

01:41:54.024 --> 01:41:55.943
There are lots of people
who could be the father.

01:41:56.026 --> 01:41:57.236
[man] Could you be the father?

01:41:57.319 --> 01:41:58.654
I don't know. I mean…

01:42:00.197 --> 01:42:02.199
Sometimes I'm a bad boy. Yeah.

01:42:02.783 --> 01:42:04.743
Who is the father of Dannielynn?

01:42:05.869 --> 01:42:09.373
He's the father of her.

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:10.999
[Larry] I am the father.

01:42:11.083 --> 01:42:13.502
You know, until science proves me wrong,
I am the father.

01:42:14.586 --> 01:42:16.713
[Stern] We really haven't been allowed

01:42:16.797 --> 01:42:19.424
with the way
that this whole thing has been handled.

01:42:20.175 --> 01:42:21.885
And, you know, I…

01:42:22.469 --> 01:42:25.973
It's gonna be, uh, I think, a little while

01:43:02.968 --> 01:43:06.471

01:43:07.639 --> 01:43:09.308
What, is she not responsive?

01:43:09.391 --> 01:43:11.435
[officer 2] Not responsive

She's, um, actually Anna Nicole Smith.

01:43:16.732 --> 01:43:19.401

in front of the store going,

01:44:18.585 --> 01:44:22.172
"Do you know what's going on?
What happened? Did you hear?"

01:44:22.923 --> 01:44:26.051
And I'm like, "What are you talking about?
Who are you?"

All these news vans.

01:44:29.346 --> 01:44:34.851
And Patrik goes… calls, uh,
Anna's number. She's not answering.

01:44:34.935 --> 01:44:37.646
Calls Howard. He's not answering.

01:44:37.729 --> 01:44:41.108
Calls Mo, and he goes,
"Baby girl is gone."

01:44:41.984 --> 01:44:43.694
Baby girl is gone."

01:44:43.777 --> 01:44:49.992
And the pain that he was speaking with
was so great.

01:44:51.368 --> 01:44:55.998
Run to the airport. First flight out.
Five hours later, we're in Florida.

01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:59.751
Howard was a mess.

01:45:00.377 --> 01:45:01.295
I mean,

01:45:02.713 --> 01:45:04.172
he was inconsolable.

01:45:05.257 --> 01:45:08.135
[anchor] A lot of people are really
painting Howard K. Stern as a villain.

01:45:08.218 --> 01:45:09.303
[man] How you doing today?

01:45:09.386 --> 01:45:12.347
[anchor] A lot of people have made him out
to be a manipulator.

01:45:12.431 --> 01:45:15.267
[anchor 2] Reportedly, they are looking
for possible prescriptions

01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:19.438
written out to Howard K. Stern
to supply Anna with drugs.

01:45:19.521 --> 01:45:22.899
Can you tell me why you're not cooperating
with the Broward County Medical Examiner?

01:45:22.983 --> 01:45:24.192
I have no comment to make.

01:45:24.276 --> 01:45:29.406
The methadone prescriptions
with my name on it appears in the press.

01:45:29.489 --> 01:45:33.994
This doctor shipped it over to her,
to a pregnant lady.

01:45:35.329 --> 01:45:38.123
And it… it felt like
they were blaming me for her death,

01:45:38.206 --> 01:45:41.001
um, and… and they were.

01:45:41.084 --> 01:45:42.836
[camera shutters clicking]

01:45:44.129 --> 01:45:45.505
[anchor] This may say a lot

01:45:45.589 --> 01:45:49.926
about our current culture
of celebrity and media these days

01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:53.263
when all the major cable news networks

01:45:53.347 --> 01:45:57.309
switched over to non-stop,
live coverage this afternoon,

01:45:57.392 --> 01:46:00.854
when word arrived
that Anna Nicole Smith had died.

01:46:00.937 --> 01:46:02.939
She was 39 years old.

01:46:03.023 --> 01:46:06.026
She was adored by millions
but loved by few.

01:46:06.610 --> 01:46:10.197
There was obviously always this sorta air
of tragedy around Anna Nicole Smith.

01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:12.199
She had so much misfortune in her life.

01:46:12.282 --> 01:46:14.284
[anchor] So what about Anna's money?

01:46:14.368 --> 01:46:18.914
Does she have a will,
and, um, who is the father of this child?

01:46:19.581 --> 01:46:21.500
Whoever has access to this child,

01:46:21.583 --> 01:46:25.545
whoever is raising this child has access
to whatever monies this child inherits,

01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:29.549
which is potentially tens of millions
if not hundreds of millions of dollars.

01:46:29.633 --> 01:46:33.136
I mean, the phrase "rest in peace"
means absolutely nothing, unfortunately,

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:35.013
when it comes to Anna Nicole Smith.

01:46:35.097 --> 01:46:36.473

01:46:51.696 --> 01:46:55.075
[Missy] She told me all the time
that she was gonna die young.

01:46:57.285 --> 01:47:00.497
And I felt really bad because I said, I…
you know, I should've believed her.

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:05.127
I should've, uh, spent some more time
doing things that were positive.

01:47:06.711 --> 01:47:09.256
I shouldn't have said
the stuff I said to her,

01:47:09.339 --> 01:47:11.591
you know, because now, I'm…
I can't take it back.

01:47:11.675 --> 01:47:13.844
I'm never gonna be able to change it.
It's… It's over.

01:47:13.927 --> 01:47:14.803
[Missy sniffling]

01:47:15.303 --> 01:47:18.598
And then I thought about her baby girl,
and I thought, "How sad."

01:47:18.682 --> 01:47:20.892
Because that little girl's
never gonna know

01:47:20.976 --> 01:47:24.521
how much her mother loved her
even before she was born, you know?

01:47:24.604 --> 01:47:27.983
She… She's never gonna know
how badly her mom wanted her,

01:47:28.066 --> 01:47:31.027
and she's never gonna feel
her hugging her,

01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:34.406
and… and singing to her, and doing
all those things that mothers do.

01:47:34.489 --> 01:47:36.491
[somber music playing]

01:47:42.914 --> 01:47:45.667
[Missy] But I thought, you know,
"At least, she's back with Daniel."

01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:49.212
"At least, her and Daniel
are back together," and… [sniffling]

01:47:51.548 --> 01:47:53.216
[inaudible]

01:47:57.262 --> 01:47:59.014
[camera shutters clicking]

01:48:23.413 --> 01:48:24.414
[music fades]

01:48:28.376 --> 01:48:30.378
[crow cawing]

01:48:34.799 --> 01:48:35.884
[dog barking]

01:48:55.987 --> 01:48:58.240
First of all, she's not my mother.

01:48:58.323 --> 01:48:59.866
She's my birth mother.

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:02.369
[somber music playing]

01:49:08.166 --> 01:49:11.294
[Anna] I left home
when I was 15 years old.

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:15.840
[Missy] I'm just sitting on the couch, uh,
and the TV's on.

01:49:15.924 --> 01:49:19.135
And I see Nicky on TV.

01:49:20.971 --> 01:49:24.558
What has she done for me?
You wanna hear how my childhood was?

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:28.270
All the beatings,
and the whippings, and the rape.

01:49:29.145 --> 01:49:30.397
That's my mother.

01:49:31.273 --> 01:49:32.691
That's my mom.

01:49:32.774 --> 01:49:34.985
[Missy] She said
that she was raped at home,

01:49:35.068 --> 01:49:37.737
and she had to run away from home,
and she was beaten.

01:49:39.406 --> 01:49:40.615
Bitch.

01:49:41.199 --> 01:49:43.827
[Missy] I was shocked, because I knew

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:46.496
that was not her childhood
coming out of her mouth.

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:47.831
That was my childhood.

01:49:47.914 --> 01:49:50.542
That's exactly what happened to me
and the way I relayed it to her.

01:49:57.924 --> 01:50:02.178
Vickie told people
that my mama abused her.

01:50:03.555 --> 01:50:06.975
And she did not abuse her.

01:50:07.684 --> 01:50:11.396
My mother was a very sweet, loving person.

01:50:17.068 --> 01:50:19.529
[Missy] The only person
that I ever remember

01:50:19.613 --> 01:50:21.448
coming to her rescue was her mother,

01:50:21.531 --> 01:50:22.866
over and over and over.

01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:26.995
There were times that we got out of
a lot of trouble because of Virgie.

01:50:27.996 --> 01:50:31.082
If she had not been
in… in law enforcement,

01:50:31.166 --> 01:50:33.877
we… we would've been in prison
a couple times, you know?

01:50:36.504 --> 01:50:40.800
[Donald] They did talk to each other
behind the scenes.

01:50:42.802 --> 01:50:44.596
And they cared about each other.

01:50:48.433 --> 01:50:52.020
My mom passed away three years ago
with cancer.

01:50:53.813 --> 01:50:55.565
[birds chirping]

01:50:57.484 --> 01:50:58.943
[ominous music playing]

01:50:59.027 --> 01:51:00.320
We were not poor.

01:51:01.071 --> 01:51:04.032
We lived a moderate life in Houston.

01:51:08.495 --> 01:51:11.289
Three bedrooms, two carports.

01:51:18.129 --> 01:51:20.173
She would tell these stories

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:23.009
about what a horrible

01:51:24.594 --> 01:51:26.012
childhood she had.

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:28.264
And I said… I asked her one time. I said,

01:51:28.348 --> 01:51:31.935
"Vickie Lynn, why do you tell such lies?"

01:51:32.018 --> 01:51:33.103
"Why do you do that?"

01:51:33.728 --> 01:51:37.816
She said, "Mother, I wish
you could just understand that…

01:51:39.275 --> 01:51:44.614
I make more money telling sad stories

01:51:44.698 --> 01:51:47.242
than I make telling good stories."

01:51:47.325 --> 01:51:49.619
She… She said, "Don't get me wrong."

01:51:49.703 --> 01:51:53.581
"I make money
anytime my name is out in the open."

01:51:54.332 --> 01:51:56.459
"Anytime my name
is written down somewhere,

01:51:56.543 --> 01:51:59.045
in the newspaper, on TV, in the news."

01:51:59.129 --> 01:52:00.130
"It doesn't matter."

01:52:00.213 --> 01:52:03.425
"If my name is out there,
I'm making money."

01:52:04.426 --> 01:52:06.803
"Which is my purpose in life.
I'm making money."

01:52:07.303 --> 01:52:13.435
She said, "But if it's… if it's bad,
something really bad,

01:52:14.477 --> 01:52:20.191
I make 50 times the amount of money
than I make if it's good."

01:52:22.026 --> 01:52:26.197
And I said, "Well, Vickie, don't you want
people to think good about you?"

01:52:27.532 --> 01:52:29.993
She says, "Well, no.
Not if bad pays better."

01:52:31.536 --> 01:52:33.663
I said, "Doesn't it embarrass you?"

01:52:35.665 --> 01:52:39.544
She says, "No, not to the tune
of however much money I can make from it,

01:52:39.627 --> 01:52:40.795
it doesn't embarrass me."

01:52:40.879 --> 01:52:43.548
I said, "Don't you think
it embarrasses your family?"

01:52:46.050 --> 01:52:49.554
She says, "Mom… this is my life."

01:52:49.637 --> 01:52:50.680
[Virgie chuckling]

01:52:50.764 --> 01:52:53.308
"Not your life. This is my life."

01:52:53.391 --> 01:52:56.936
"So I ought to be able to tell
whatever stories I want to tell."

01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:59.230
"True or false,
I ought to be able to tell 'em."

01:53:02.734 --> 01:53:07.989
Nicky did very much get swept away
by a story that she created.

01:53:09.616 --> 01:53:11.993
Can you tell so many lies
and tell it so many times

01:53:12.076 --> 01:53:13.661
that all of a sudden it's true?

01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:20.001
But she lost her son.
She lost… She lost her life.

01:53:20.084 --> 01:53:21.753
She lost everything.

01:53:24.297 --> 01:53:26.132
That's what it cost her.

01:53:32.055 --> 01:53:33.181
