a new burst ofenergy.

that they killed their daughter
and claimed she was abducted

We waited so long for a child.
She made us a family.

00:58.768 --> 01:01.680
- Do either ofyou have children?
- Yeah, I do.

01:03.105 --> 01:06.472
How anybody thinks
that we could hurt her—

01:06.567 --> 01:08.523

You said there
was new information?

It’s from one ofthose traffic cameras.

Do you see there?
That is Samantha ’s sweater.

01:18.913 --> 01:23.373

take weeks to talk to everybody.

that kind oftime.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.849
leaving a restaurant
called the Happy Dragon.

could use some privacy,

Took part how?

- You never turned to violence.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.818
I guess a lot ofthe victims did?

12:59.905 --> 13:04.239
We have to forgive them.
Many had no choice.
l was lucky.

13:04.368 --> 13:08.611
Lucky how?
I was never forced to
participate in the massacres.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.912
That’s really lucky, isn’t it?

13:10.999 --> 13:13.536
I’m thankful every day.

13:13.627 --> 13:18.166
I don’t think I’d have the strength
to live with something like that.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.167
Well, I should get back
to our hosts.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.510
But I’m speaking
at Seaver Hall this evening.
I hope you’ll come.

13:22.636 --> 13:26.379
I look forward to it.
Bring your book.
I’ll sign it ifyou like.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.555
I would like.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.600
No shame when she talked
about the violence.

13:36.692 --> 13:39.559
It’s hard to believe she killed anybody.
Did you see anything?

13:39.653 --> 13:42.360
No. We should go
hear her speak.

13:42.447 --> 13:46.235
Yeah, she wanted to sign my book.
I think we had a connection.

13:46.326 --> 13:50.740
Oh, yeah. Because Ugandan
women can’t resist a guy
with a girlie drink.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.241
[ Mrs. Burch]
Samantha did not run away.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.997
Whatever you may
have been told.

13:58.130 --> 14:01.338
It’s something we have
to consider, Mrs. Burch.
[ Cell Phone Rings]

14:01.425 --> 14:03.290
Sorry. Sorry.

14:03.385 --> 14:07.378
Oh, I gotta take this.
Um, it’s my daughter.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.305
Just a second.
Hello?

14:11.560 --> 14:14.677
Absolutely not.
’Cause I said so.

14:14.771 --> 14:19.686
No. I said absolutely not.
We— Don’t be such a bitch!

14:19.776 --> 14:22.188
Shut up! Stop it!

14:22.279 --> 14:26.113
- How we doing?
- Sympathy, then horror.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.362
Oh, good.
Yeah, thanks, love.

14:29.453 --> 14:31.444
No, that was fine.
That was good.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.779
Very good
Well, depends when lfinish.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.160
All right. Yeah, I love you.
I love you too. Okay, bye.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.333
So, what the hell was that?

14:38.462 --> 14:42.330
Well, I’m not an abusive parent.
And it doesn’t look
like you are either.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.335
You th/nk this is
some k/nd of game?

14:44.426 --> 14:46.166
Do you think we abused
our daughter?

14:46.261 --> 14:50.300
- Brian.
- I’m sorry, Mr. Burch,
but we had to rule it out.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.598
Is this how you people
treat your clients?
I mean, this is a good family!

14:53.685 --> 14:57.052
- This is a happy family!
- Samantha and I are very close.

14:57.147 --> 15:00.230
I think you’re telling
the truth. I do.

15:00.317 --> 15:03.980
But you, on the other hand,
there’s something you’re not saying.

15:04.071 --> 15:07.609
No. She’s saying everything.

15:10.160 --> 15:14.278
It’s all right, Mrs. Burch.
You can tell us.

15:18.126 --> 15:21.664
You never saw what she was like
when she was alone with me, Brian.

15:25.175 --> 15:28.713
A few weeks before
Samantha disappeared,
she threw one of her tantrums.

15:28.804 --> 15:32.217
And I tried to hold her.

15:32.307 --> 15:35.720
I tried.
But she was so strong.

15:35.811 --> 15:39.269
And she— she pushed me away.
I don’t know—

15:39.356 --> 15:42.098
I don’t know how this happened.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.228
Go on.

15:46.071 --> 15:48.778
She fell into the s-stove.

15:48.865 --> 15:53.529
And her shirt touched
one ofthe burners
and it caught on fire.

15:53.620 --> 15:57.488
And it burned her back
It was an accident.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.574
Samantha felt gu/lty about it.
And/ was—

16:00.669 --> 16:03.752
I was so ashamed.
So we didn’t tell you.

16:03.839 --> 16:07.582
And I went
to the hospital alone.
It was an accident.

16:07.676 --> 16:11.260
I’m so sorry, Brian.
I’m so sorry, Brian.

16:11.346 --> 16:14.429
But it wasn’t— wasn’t my fault.
It’s not my fault that she’s gone.

16:14.558 --> 16:17.846
It’s not my fault.
It’s okay.

16:17.936 --> 16:22.521
It’s okay.
Sometimes adopted kids
have trouble connecting.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.064
Thousands of mothers
go through it.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.985
It’s nothing to be ashamed of.

16:28.071 --> 16:29.936
Okay?

16:33.451 --> 16:35.362
Given what happened at home,

16:35.453 --> 16:38.445
you have to consider the possibility
that Samantha ran away.

16:38.540 --> 16:41.703
Unless none of it happened
and they’re pulling the wool
over our eyes.

16:41.835 --> 16:45.623
You know how many
abusive parents I’ve seen fake tears?
Ah, they’re not faking it.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.296
We’ll see.

16:48.383 --> 16:51.125
Still, ifshe was burned that badly,
she needed more treatment.

16:51.219 --> 16:55.087
I’ll have my people check
the hospitals and clinics.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.013
Thank you.

16:59.102 --> 17:04.017
You know, you were
very good back there
with Mrs. Burch.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.940
Very nurturing.

17:07.027 --> 17:11.020
Maybe you should get a puppy.
I could talk to Obama’s people.

17:11.114 --> 17:13.105
Alec has allergies.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.067
Poodles. No fur.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.776
They have hair.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.451
It’s not what it’s about.

17:31.218 --> 17:34.927
I watched as they murdered
almost every member
ofthe village.

17:35.013 --> 17:39.347
The rest of us, they dragged
into the bush where I was made
a rebel officer’s wife.

17:39.434 --> 17:42.676
The horrors lsaw
are beyond compare.

17:42.771 --> 17:46.104
Rape, torture,

17:46.191 --> 17:48.807
massacres carried out
by child soldiers.

17:48.902 --> 17:53.987
Northern Uganda has been stuck
in this n/ghtmare for over 20 years.

17:54.074 --> 17:57.987
No deception leakage.
She wasn’t involved
in the massacres.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.818
She seems pretty anxious.

17:59.913 --> 18:03.405
Well, it’s not unusual. She’s speaking
in front ofa big group of people.

18:03.500 --> 18:08.244
Thank you all so much
for com/ng out to support peace
in northern Uganda.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.829
[All Applauding]

18:16.846 --> 18:20.179
[Chattering]

18:20.267 --> 18:23.725
Thank you for coming.
I hope my speech
wasn’t too long and boring.

18:23.812 --> 18:25.894
Oh, no, no. We’re fans.

18:25.981 --> 18:27.937
Youlooked
a little nervous up there.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.276
You’d think I’d be used
to public speaking by now.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.476
But I’ll admit...
my heart still races.

18:32.570 --> 18:36.108
Oh, I brought
my copy of your book.
You promised to sign it.

18:36.199 --> 18:39.111
Of course.
This is for both ofyou?

18:39.244 --> 18:41.701
Oh, no, no.
We’re not together.
Oh, no.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.530
No, we came together.
But it is not a date.

18:48.503 --> 18:51.085
Well, it was nice
to meet you... both.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.295
What?

19:05.687 --> 19:09.100
We heard Miss Mugisha speak twice
about the massacres.

19:09.190 --> 19:13.433
When she denied being involved,
there was no increase
in what we call manipulators.

19:13.570 --> 19:17.154
And no visible microexpressions.
And what’s that in English?

19:17.240 --> 19:21.074
She said she didn’t kill anyone
and she was telling the truth.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.573
Great. That’s it then.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.746
- I think we might want to take
another look at her.
- Why?

19:26.833 --> 19:29.916
There’s something about her.
Something’s— Something’s not right.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.085
Do you have any evidence
to support that?

19:32.172 --> 19:34.788
No. But ifwe brought her
back in, we could—

19:34.883 --> 19:37.795
I don’t have time for this.
I came in for your report.
What is it?

19:37.886 --> 19:40.502
There is no evidence
that she’s lying.

19:40.597 --> 19:44.465
That’s what I needed to hear.
Thanks very much.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.475
I guess Mugisha
gets to meet Oprah.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.229
What does it say?

19:55.320 --> 19:59.654
“Eli, thank you for listening.
I hope to see you again.”

20:01.451 --> 20:04.693
And, uh, that’s her phone number.

20:10.335 --> 20:13.998
Thanks for calling us,
Detective.

20:14.130 --> 20:17.122
Where’d you get
this prize then?
Canvassing the hospitals.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.833
He was working as a nurse
at the free clinic in Mount Pleasant.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.761
He seemed a little off,
so we ran him.

20:22.847 --> 20:26.260
Turns out he was working
under a false name.
Guy’s a registered pedophile.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.637
- Whoopsie.
- Why bring us in?

20:28.728 --> 20:31.344
We haven’t been able to get
anything out ofhim.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.646
You guys have done
okay so far.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.773
He’s got something for us.
Let’s hope.

20:39.864 --> 20:42.856
No. I’m telling you.

20:42.951 --> 20:45.784
He’s trying
not to give himselfaway.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.906
This guy knows something.

20:55.422 --> 20:58.630
/ told the detectives
/ ha ven ’t seen the girl.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.674
Yeah, I know.
I don’t believe you.

21:01.803 --> 21:04.294
Well, I’m telling the truth.
No, you’re not. You’re lying.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.844
No.
No, you are. You’re lying. Yeah.

21:14.691 --> 21:18.354
[Sighs]
I never touched her, all right?

21:18.445 --> 21:21.107
Now that’s the truth.

21:21.197 --> 21:24.109
I don’t think you’re even
attracted to her, are you?

21:24.200 --> 21:27.943
But you have seen her, right?

21:28.037 --> 21:33.031
IfI say I saw her,
they’ll say that I hurt her.

21:33.168 --> 21:36.080
Even you think I hurt her.
No, that’s not true.

21:36.171 --> 21:39.834
I don’t think you hurt her.
I don’t.

21:41.885 --> 21:44.001
Now you’re sweating.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.344
And you’re frail.

21:47.432 --> 21:50.845
Despera te/y trying
to control yourself

21:51.895 --> 21:53.431
What are you on?

21:55.940 --> 21:59.728
I take Medco progesterone.
That’s for chemical castration, right?

21:59.861 --> 22:03.524
You doing that to yourself?
I don’t want to hurt any more kids.

22:03.615 --> 22:06.197
Good for you. That’s nice.

22:08.578 --> 22:11.411
So where did you see her then?

22:16.044 --> 22:18.706
At the clinic.
She has a full thickness burn.

22:18.796 --> 22:21.788
She comes in every other
Wednesday so /can treat it.

22:21.883 --> 22:24.215
Keep taking the pills, Kevin.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.465
Got it.

22:31.559 --> 22:33.424
Dinner was wonderful.
Thank you.

22:33.561 --> 22:36.769
You think dinner was good,
wait forthe tour.
What are these pictures?

22:36.856 --> 22:40.064
Well, uh, the faces
are speaking.

22:40.151 --> 22:42.858
[ Farida ]
What are they saying?

22:42.946 --> 22:46.313
They’re telling the truth
about what each person is feeling.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.489
That’s what we do here.

22:48.576 --> 22:51.613
We read faces and body language
and we try to spot lies.

22:52.747 --> 22:55.329
t 00k, agony,

22:56.876 --> 22:59.458
contempt, disgust.

22:59.587 --> 23:02.249
They look the same
on everybody?
Yeah. They’re universal.

23:02.340 --> 23:06.925
- / don ’t believe it.
- Well, I peed sitting down till I was 10.

23:07.845 --> 23:11.884
See? Your eyes widened.
Surprise:

23:11.975 --> 23:14.808
an American politician,

23:14.894 --> 23:17.977
a French president
and you.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.897
It’s the same expression
using the same muscles.

23:20.984 --> 23:22.770
It’s remarkable.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.230
What?

23:29.325 --> 23:34.490
I was...just imagining
a thousand things
I want to do with you.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.369
Let’s go for a ride.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.845
Not her.

23:54.559 --> 23:57.392
It’s been two hours.
You think we can trust that pervert?

23:57.478 --> 24:01.562
Yeah. In my experience, self-castrating
pedophiles generally tell the truth.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.683
Got another one.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.063
That’s her.

24:07.196 --> 24:09.482
You sure?
Yeah, yeah.
t ook at her eyes.

24:09.574 --> 24:13.613
Samantha Burch? I’m a police officer.
I’m here to help you.

24:13.703 --> 24:16.570
She’s gonna run.
She’s gonna run.

24:16.664 --> 24:19.326
There she goes.

24:21.419 --> 24:24.536
I’m not gonna hurt you.
It’s okay.
No! Let me go! Let me go!

24:24.672 --> 24:28.085
Where is she?
She’s in with Child
Protective Services.

24:29.719 --> 24:31.801
Follow me.

24:32.805 --> 24:36.514
Oh, my God. She’s here.
Samantha.

24:36.601 --> 24:38.717
[Mrs Burch]
t et me see her.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.722
[Door Opens]

24:40.813 --> 24:44.226
[Gasps]
Oh, my baby.

24:44.317 --> 24:48.230
My little girl.
It’s really you.

24:49.906 --> 24:51.442
It’s really you.

24:51.532 --> 24:55.195
0h, Samantha, thank God
you’re all right. Samantha.

24:58.164 --> 25:02.749
My name isJessica,
and I have to get home before my curfew.

25:05.380 --> 25:10.090
Sammy Sweetheart.
Don ’t you recognize us?

25:12.011 --> 25:16.721
My name isJessica,
and I have to get home before my curfew.

25:24.899 --> 25:27.686
[Cal]
Now Samantha swallowed
when she saw her parents.

25:27.777 --> 25:30.735
And she swallowed again
when she said her name wasJessica.

25:30.822 --> 25:34.690
- Swallowing is a sign of strong emotion.
- So she recognized her parents.

25:34.784 --> 25:37.446
She lied about her name.
And she knew she was lying.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.744
She’s too clean and well fed
to be a runaway.

25:39.831 --> 25:41.367
Could she have
Stockholm syndrome?

25:41.457 --> 25:43.322
It seems more like
battered-person syndrome.

25:43.418 --> 25:46.205
No bruises, no cuts,
no signs of sexual abuse.

25:46.337 --> 25:50.046
Yeah, but with kids,
/ust the threat of abuse
is somet/mes enough to control them.

25:50.133 --> 25:53.045
We need her to name
her abductor, r/ght?

25:53.136 --> 25:55.878
So we have to break their bond.

25:55.972 --> 25:59.510
You any good with kids, Detective?

26:03.438 --> 26:07.556
Elements of Content Based Analysis.
These are Foster’s books.

26:07.650 --> 26:10.767
Yeah, I borrowed a few.
Been doing some research.

26:10.862 --> 26:13.854
- Okay. Into what?
- Uh, Mugisha.

26:13.948 --> 26:16.815
/’ve been trying to ﬁgure out
what felt wrong about her.

26:16.909 --> 26:20.117
- What do you mean?
-Just— Listen.

26:21.998 --> 26:25.616
The rebels agreed to a cease-fire
a week before my birthday.

26:25.710 --> 26:30.625
But without the support of
the international community,
talks broke down by Christmas.

26:30.715 --> 26:34.082
“,4 week before my birthday”?
“Ta/ks broke down by Christmas”?

26:34.177 --> 26:36.884
Those details are contextual embedding.
It means she’s telling the truth.

26:36.971 --> 26:39.383
Yeah. But later there’s a change.

26:39.474 --> 26:42.887
