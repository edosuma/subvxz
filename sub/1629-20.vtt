The Good Witch of the South.

00:06.757 --> 00:07.837
Glinda.

00:07.925 --> 00:11.167
The next time your lips
touch Emma Swan’s,

00:11.262 --> 00:12.877
all of her magic will be taken.

00:13.222 --> 00:14.257
It's the baby.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.088
It's coming.

Let's go. Move!

00:56.807 --> 00:58.798
-Aah!
-How are you feeling?

00:59.227 --> 01:01.468
-Nurse? A little help here.
-Yes, Doctor.

01:01.812 --> 01:02.801
(GROANING)

01:03.147 --> 01:04.353
There. That will do.

01:05.483 --> 01:06.689
You said it yourself.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.025
Spinning clears your mind.

01:12.031 --> 01:15.239
Or should I say, "Your brain"?

(HEART BEATING)

01:19.330 --> 01:22.493
There's just one more ingredient
to collect.

(MONKEY SCREECHING)

02:08.713 --> 02:09.702

02:10.298 --> 02:13.085
I can't concentrate
with all that screeching.

02:13.217 --> 02:16.801
It's probably me.
He was never much of a fan.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.089
Who are you?

02:18.264 --> 02:20.050
Glinda, the Good Witch of the South.

02:21.392 --> 02:26.261
You can relax. I'm not here to fight you.
I'm here to thank you.

02:26.397 --> 02:29.264
For showing Oz
the true nature of The Wizard.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.561
And for standing up to him.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.602
And you're glad
that I turned him into a monkey?

02:35.573 --> 02:38.440
A little time as your pet
will do him good.

02:38.576 --> 02:40.191
He was a trickster.

02:40.286 --> 02:42.902
Offering people hope
he could never deliver.

02:44.165 --> 02:46.156
You're quite powerful, Zelena.

02:46.751 --> 02:47.831
I know.

02:47.918 --> 02:50.409
But you're wasting it
on these foolish pursuits.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.670
What do you know about what I want?

02:53.758 --> 02:57.751
You want to change your destiny,
but you can't go back in time.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.210
No one can.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.554
Why don't you come with me?

03:02.641 --> 03:04.302
Why on Earth would I do that?

03:04.435 --> 03:08.394
Because I think I can offer you
something that you're really looking for.

03:08.481 --> 03:10.972
There are some people
that I want you to meet.

03:11.942 --> 03:12.931
Who?

03:13.402 --> 03:15.108
Come meet your real sisters.

03:19.784 --> 03:20.990
There. Dig.

03:22.661 --> 03:23.650
Huh.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.369
You think I'll fail.

03:26.457 --> 03:29.949
I think destiny is destiny.

03:30.086 --> 03:31.075
(CHUCKLES)

03:31.879 --> 03:35.292
You're wrong. I can change it.

03:36.759 --> 03:41.093
Once I fix the past,
my mother will keep me,

03:41.180 --> 03:45.970
Regina will never have been born,
and I'll get everything she ever had.

03:46.102 --> 03:50.141
With the right ingredients,
I can do anything.

03:51.315 --> 03:54.432
Whether it works or not
is irrelevant, dearie.

03:55.361 --> 03:59.650
Because no matter
what you change of your past,

04:01.283 --> 04:03.615
one thing shall remain the same.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.122
-Who you are.
-(CHUCKLES)

04:07.206 --> 04:10.369
And that is a fate you can never escape.

04:11.961 --> 04:13.497
We shall see.

04:20.469 --> 04:21.800
-lt's gonna be okay.
-(BREATH|NG DEEPLY)

04:21.887 --> 04:22.876
Is it?

04:22.972 --> 04:25.088
Our baby is gonna be fine.
It's never gonna leave your arms.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.592
I don't care who's out there.

04:26.684 --> 04:27.764
That's what we thought last time.

04:27.852 --> 04:30.059
I know. But this time,

04:31.188 --> 04:34.146
we have someone else on our side.

04:38.571 --> 04:42.985
You really think this protection spell
will be enough to hold her off?

04:43.075 --> 04:45.361
Depends if your brand of magic
is stronger than hers.

04:45.786 --> 04:46.775
If it is,

04:46.871 --> 04:49.829
no one wielding dark magic
will be able to get in here.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.416
That doesn't sound
like a vote of confidence.

04:51.542 --> 04:54.784
It isn't. But we're out of options.

04:54.879 --> 04:56.164
HOOK: Swan?

04:58.340 --> 05:00.205
I heard the little royal was on his way.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.508
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to be here right now.

05:02.887 --> 05:03.967
I want to help.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.089
If you really wanted to help,

05:05.181 --> 05:06.591
you would have told me
when Zelena cursed your lips.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.138
I had no choice.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.557
She threatened you and your family.

05:10.686 --> 05:12.972
l was trying to help.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.473
Telling me what was going on
would've been help.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.556
And a death sentence for your boy.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.941
Henry's safety is my concern, not yours,

05:20.029 --> 05:21.690
which is why
I'm taking this fight to Zelena.

05:21.780 --> 05:22.769
(SIGHS)

05:23.073 --> 05:24.654
This ends today.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.741
Emma, wait.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.623
You don't have to do this alone.

05:34.710 --> 05:35.916
Yeah, I do.
You need to stay with Mary Margaret.

05:36.003 --> 05:39.461
Yeah, I know, but you need help.
Take Hook.

05:40.049 --> 05:41.164
Are you insane?

05:41.258 --> 05:43.340
He's going with you.
You're going with her.

05:43.427 --> 05:44.792
Thought you didn't trust me, mate.

05:44.887 --> 05:47.003
Zelena backed you into a corner,
you did the best you could.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.428
See? Even your father gets it.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.422
Yeah, because he knows
about keeping secrets from loved ones.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.970
-Hey.
-l'm sorry. I'm doing this alone.

05:53.062 --> 05:54.518
No, you're not.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.345
This isn't about you. It's about all of us.

05:56.941 --> 06:00.183
What is he going to do? I have magic.
He's got one hand.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.357
You know I'm good in a fight.

06:01.445 --> 06:02.855
At the very least, he can draw fire.

06:02.947 --> 06:04.903
What, now, I'm cannon fodder?

06:06.116 --> 06:07.697
Fine. He can come.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.451
Fair enough.

06:10.746 --> 06:13.453
-Shall we?
-Hang on. Give me a sec.

06:15.626 --> 06:16.786
Hey, kid.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.118
Hey, Mom. Is the baby here?

06:19.213 --> 06:20.328
Not yet, but it will be soon.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.458
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
l have to take care of this witch.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.791
But it's gonna be all right,
and I'll be back before you know it.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.714
I know. I'm not worried.

06:27.805 --> 06:29.011
Yeah?

06:29.098 --> 06:31.305
Defeating bad guys is what you do.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.977
Go. I'll keep him safe.

06:41.610 --> 06:42.645
Thank you.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.150
You ready, Swan?

06:45.614 --> 06:47.650
Yeah, let's end this.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.623
ARCHIE: Are you keeping
up on current events?

06:59.253 --> 07:01.244
No, I'm looking at the classifieds.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.078
Oh. A little young for a job, aren't you?

07:03.173 --> 07:05.585
I'm actually looking at apartments.

07:06.135 --> 07:09.252
Mary Margaret's place
will be crowded after the baby,

07:09.346 --> 07:11.257
and I'll be back and forth from Regina's,

07:11.348 --> 07:13.509
but Emma, she can't sleep in her car.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.512
No, not comfortably.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.519
It's really good to see you, Henry.
I've missed you.

07:20.608 --> 07:21.814
Me, too.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.860
Maybe a place by the water with a view.

07:28.198 --> 07:32.316
Have you spoken to Emma about this?
About staying in Storybrooke?

07:33.662 --> 07:36.699
What's to talk about? We're home.

07:38.334 --> 07:40.120
EMMA: I never should have brought
Henry back to Storybrooke.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.461
HOOK: You did what you felt was right.

07:41.545 --> 07:42.625
I did what you manipulated me into.

07:42.713 --> 07:45.420
Your parents needed you, Swan.
The town needed you.

07:45.507 --> 07:48.294
Henry also needed me.
We were happy in New York.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.967
Once I'm done melting this witch,
I'd like us to be happy again.

07:51.055 --> 07:54.388
As content as you were in that city,
it wasn't real.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.973
It was real for me, for him.
Everything that happened, happened.

07:57.061 --> 08:00.553
Minus all the things you'd forgotten.
Part of you is not the real you.

08:00.689 --> 08:03.647
And like it or not, the big part of you
and Henry belongs in this town.

08:04.068 --> 08:05.649
Yeah, the part of us
that's always in danger.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.067
We're leaving.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.655
What does the boy think?

08:08.739 --> 08:10.900
He's a kid.
He wants chocolate milk in his cereal.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.982
l'm his mother.
I know what's best for him.

08:13.077 --> 08:15.318
What's best for him or for you?

08:15.746 --> 08:17.077
Excuse me?

08:18.082 --> 08:20.994
You've taken care of the boy
quite well here.

08:21.085 --> 08:25.249
You talk about danger all you like,
but it isn't that.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.830
So, tell me, what is it?

08:28.258 --> 08:30.670
Why are you so scared of staying?

08:31.553 --> 08:34.260
I think it's because
you can see a future here.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.092
A happy one.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.433
Let me guess. With you?

08:40.521 --> 08:41.510
ZELENA: AW!

08:41.939 --> 08:43.850
You two are so adorable.

08:43.941 --> 08:47.934
But instead of looking for each other,
maybe you should be focused on me.

08:48.070 --> 08:52.188
Although, without magic,
that could prove to be a challenge.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.362
Next time you try to take my power,

08:53.450 --> 08:55.941
why don't you try enchanting the lips
of someone I'll actually kiss?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.448
See, Emma,
you've got a decision to make.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.952
You can keep your magic,
which makes you, oh, so sad.

09:02.084 --> 09:05.076
Or you can save the man
that you can't wait to run away from.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.127
Rumple?

09:10.134 --> 09:11.123
Hook!

09:11.760 --> 09:12.966
Choose wisely.

09:15.973 --> 09:16.962
(GRUNTS)

09:17.850 --> 09:19.340
ZELENA: Try all you like.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.801
You can't free him.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.154
WICKED WITCH: What is this place?

09:31.280 --> 09:33.145
GOOD WITCH: The heart of Oz.

09:33.282 --> 09:37.651
These are my sister witches
from the North and the East.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.493
Each represents
a special part of magic.

09:40.622 --> 09:43.204
Love, wisdom, and courage.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.750
Together, our abilities
are far more powerful

09:46.837 --> 09:48.873
than they could ever be on our own.

09:49.006 --> 09:50.962
We can do things that no one else can.

09:51.884 --> 09:53.124
Like travel through time?

09:55.179 --> 09:57.295
That's not why we brought you here.

09:57.639 --> 10:01.382
But you said you wanted to help me.
If you can't change my past, then...

10:01.518 --> 10:05.056
I brought you here
to change your future.

10:05.189 --> 10:08.022
This seat has been empty
for some time.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.523
We'd like you to fill it.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.024
What does the West represent?

10:15.157 --> 10:16.897
The most elusive of elements.

10:17.743 --> 10:18.858
Innocence.

10:20.496 --> 10:23.203
Well, then I'm the last person
that you should consider.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.698
I mean, look at me. I'm wicked.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.867
But you don't have to be.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.124
Innocence reclaimed can be
just as powerful as innocence born.

10:31.215 --> 10:34.048
You simply have to choose to be good.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.797
Well, that's easy for you to say.
Good is part of your name.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.258
Glinda, aren't you going to tell her?

10:41.308 --> 10:42.388
Tell me what?

10:43.727 --> 10:44.716
(SIGHS)

10:44.812 --> 10:46.894
I didn't want to say anything
unless I had to.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.471
I wanted to let you
shape your own destiny.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.727
What could you possibly know
about my destiny?

10:52.402 --> 10:54.484
Glinda is the keeper
of The Book of Records.

10:54.571 --> 10:58.063
It chronicles the past, present,
and future of Oz.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.486
The book foretells
of a powerful sorceress

11:00.577 --> 11:04.240
who will join our Sisterhood
as a protector of Oz.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.245
And you think that that's me?

11:06.333 --> 11:07.834
The book says
that this sorceress from the West

11:07.918 --> 11:10.409
will come to this land by cyclone.

11:10.921 --> 11:13.162
I was brought here by a cyclone.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.542
GLINDA: That's right.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.625
We've been looking for you
for a long time, Zelena.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.422
You've always been meant for more.

11:20.097 --> 11:23.430
WITCH OF THE NORTH: I know you
don't think so, but you can do this.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.098
You just have to let go of your past.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.353
Hook! Hook!

11:34.444 --> 11:36.935
Hook, wake up! Killian!

11:37.656 --> 11:38.896
Killian, come back to me.

11:38.991 --> 11:42.154
Oh, God. Son of a bitch.

12:07.144 --> 12:08.509
Swan?

12:11.815 --> 12:13.316
What did you do?

12:13.817 --> 12:15.478
What did you do?

12:24.453 --> 12:26.068
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

12:37.925 --> 12:40.667
Sorry, sis, but I'm over you.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.259
That was lovely, Zelena.

12:46.350 --> 12:49.262
I'm impressed.
I knew you would make the right choice.

12:53.023 --> 12:54.012
(CHUCKLES)

12:56.193 --> 12:57.478
What's that?

12:57.569 --> 12:59.776
A very special pendant.

12:59.863 --> 13:02.195
Each of the witches in the Sisterhood
wears one.

13:04.076 --> 13:05.156
Guard it with your life.

13:05.243 --> 13:08.326
Because in many ways,
it now is your life.

13:09.790 --> 13:13.408
You were born with great power,
Zelena,

13:13.543 --> 13:17.377
and now, this pendant will harness,
protect and grow that power,

13:17.464 --> 13:18.579
all of it.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.085
Will it make me stronger?

13:21.718 --> 13:23.925
Than you could possibly imagine.

13:24.054 --> 13:27.888
However, the price is,
without it, you are powerless.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.974
But so long as
you do continue to wear it,

13:31.061 --> 13:34.144
you will be able
to accomplish untold miracles.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.225
Does this mean...

13:36.316 --> 13:37.556
You are one of us?

13:38.068 --> 13:40.059
Yes, our sister.

13:41.655 --> 13:42.815
Take a look.

13:47.995 --> 13:48.984
(CHUCKLES)

13:54.960 --> 13:56.325
Oh, thank you.

13:56.420 --> 14:00.333
Don't thank me. Thank yourself.
You did it all.

14:00.424 --> 14:04.758
You let go of your envy.
You took control of your destiny.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.111
Aim true! For Little John!

14:37.335 --> 14:39.041
Oh. Didn't you learn your lesson
the last time?

14:39.129 --> 14:41.541
This is more powerful
than your true love.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.587
I refuse to believe that.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.666
-Belle, go.
-Listen to him, dear.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.214
No, you've put him
through enough pain.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.216
-And I'm not nearly done.
-(GASPS)

14:50.724 --> 14:53.511

really has gone downhill.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.640
Leave her, dearie. Chop, chop.

14:58.482 --> 15:00.393
Henry, go with Dr. Hopper.

15:00.484 --> 15:02.315
Find a closet
and lock yourselves inside.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.233
You don't want to see this.
It won't be pretty.

15:04.321 --> 15:05.561
ARCHIE: Come on.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.438
No, it won't.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.568
Take another step, and I'll roast you.

15:09.659 --> 15:10.648
Please.

(GRUNTS)

15:16.708 --> 15:20.121
All this for me?

15:20.212 --> 15:24.046
Yes, sister. The West.

15:24.174 --> 15:27.041
Its future and potential
is as limitless as your own...

(WIND BLOWING)

15:34.851 --> 15:36.057
ZELENA: It's not thunder.

15:37.354 --> 15:39.595
It's a cyclone.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.850
There's something inside it.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.956
Oh, someone's trapped.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.174
Are you all right?

16:10.637 --> 16:12.628
Uh... lthink so.

16:12.722 --> 16:17.216
I tried to run to the storm cellar,
but I wasn't fast enough.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.768
What world are you from?

16:21.606 --> 16:22.595
What world?

16:24.568 --> 16:27.435
You mean this isn't Kansas?

16:27.737 --> 16:29.147
I'm afraid not.

16:30.115 --> 16:32.447
Welcome to Oz. What's your name?

16:33.577 --> 16:36.660
Dorothy. Dorothy Gale.

16:37.664 --> 16:41.577
Few are strong enough
to survive such a powerful storm.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.956
You must be
a very special girl, Dorothy.

16:45.046 --> 16:48.755
Come, we'll take you to our home.

16:48.842 --> 16:52.460
Our sisters will be very excited
to meet you. Won't they, Zelena?

Thank you. You've all been so kind.

Are you feeling all right?

19:18.867 --> 19:19.902
ZELENA: Go away.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.154
What's gotten into you?

19:26.583 --> 19:28.619
What do you think?

19:28.710 --> 19:31.122
Have you been spying
on Regina again?

19:31.463 --> 19:35.172
No, I've been watching you fawn
over your latest protégé.

19:35.675 --> 19:39.042
Dorothy? Are you jealous of her?

19:39.304 --> 19:43.297
Why? You two are so alike.

19:43.892 --> 19:48.056
Except she's spunkier, fresher faced,
and clearly more innocent than me.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.388
The perfect candidate
to take the empty seat at the table.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.599
No one is taking your seat, Zelena.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.981
Really? That's not what this says.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.364
What are you doing
with The Book of Records?

20:01.451 --> 20:04.488
You didn't tell me everything
about the prophecy.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.789
"The sorceress from another land
will make Oz her home

20:06.873 --> 20:08.784
"until she fulfills her destiny

20:08.875 --> 20:12.834
"and unseats the greatest evil
the realm has ever seen."

20:14.047 --> 20:15.753
Don't you see?

20:16.216 --> 20:20.255
Dorothy is meant to take my seat,
which makes me the greatest evil.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.669
Fate is a funny thing.

20:23.181 --> 20:26.890
You don't know if that's
what the prophecy actually means.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.013
Remember what I said.

20:30.105 --> 20:32.687
Only you can shape your destiny.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.686
But if you believe you are evil,

20:35.777 --> 20:37.893
then that is what you will become.

(HUMMING)

-Where are you going?
-I'm getting my son back.

21:16.693 --> 21:19.059
You're gonna get yourself killed.
David, think about this.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.269
What's there to think about?

21:20.363 --> 21:21.694
Don't let him get hurt.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.362
What's going on here?

21:24.284 --> 21:25.865
What happened? Did you find Zelena?

21:26.619 --> 21:28.405
I did, but I couldn't stop her.

21:28.496 --> 21:29.827
She took your brother.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.074
Because I failed?

21:31.166 --> 21:33.452
We're all still here,
so you haven't failed just yet.

21:33.543 --> 21:34.828
Hook's right. Come on.

21:34.919 --> 21:35.954
No, wait.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.586
Zelena took my magic.

21:39.424 --> 21:40.880
How the hell did that happen?

21:41.593 --> 21:42.924
It doesn't matter how. Itjust happened.

21:43.011 --> 21:44.592
So, we need to
find another way to stop her.

21:44.679 --> 21:46.385
There is no other way.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.848
That's not true. You can do it.

21:52.020 --> 21:56.104
Sweetheart, I don't think
I can survive round three with my sister.

21:56.191 --> 21:57.397
Glinda was pretty specific.

21:57.484 --> 22:01.193
"Only the purveyor of the strongest
light magic can defeat her."

22:02.071 --> 22:05.734
Zelena only beat you because
you were using dark magic against her.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.907
Okay, but that's all I have.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.235
No, it's not.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.325
When you kissed Henry,
that was true Iove's kiss.

22:13.416 --> 22:14.405
That's light magic.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.662
See? You can do it.

22:18.379 --> 22:21.246
Henry, I don't even
have my heart right now.

22:21.341 --> 22:25.334
That doesn't matter.
You broke the curse without it.

22:25.428 --> 22:27.544
And I know you still love me.

22:30.642 --> 22:32.428
I know there's good in you.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.184
He's right.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.978
I know you can beat that witch.

22:38.066 --> 22:39.431
But I don't...

22:39.526 --> 22:40.766
You have to.

22:41.361 --> 22:44.353
Once upon a time,
you were a villain, Mom.

22:44.906 --> 22:46.521
But you've changed.

22:46.658 --> 22:48.068
You're a hero now.

22:48.826 --> 22:52.068
And defeating bad guys
is what heroes do.

22:53.289 --> 22:56.281
I believe in you.
Now, you need to believe, too.

I didn't recognize you.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.090
Are you okay?

23:14.602 --> 23:17.639
I decided to stop hiding my true colors.

23:18.356 --> 23:23.316
According to the prophecy,
you're the only one that can defeat me.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.984
Defeat you?

23:25.071 --> 23:27.232
What are you talking about?
I don't want to hurt you.

23:27.323 --> 23:30.531
Good. Because I'm going to make sure
you can't.

23:33.288 --> 23:34.277
Aah!

23:35.498 --> 23:36.999
-What have you done?
-Zelena?

23:38.126 --> 23:39.115
(GASPING)

23:39.210 --> 23:40.245

23:41.754 --> 23:43.710
-l'm...
-Melting.

23:43.798 --> 23:44.833
You're melting.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.624
I'm sorry!

23:47.719 --> 23:49.755
I was only trying to put out the fire.

23:49.846 --> 23:50.835
No.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.591
It was just water!

23:52.682 --> 23:53.671
No!

24:00.356 --> 24:01.971
DOROTHY: It was just water.

24:02.567 --> 24:04.933
Glinda! Glinda!

24:08.031 --> 24:10.238
-Dorothy? What is it?
-Zelena.

24:10.325 --> 24:14.193
(SOBBING) She came up to me with
a ball of fire, and I threw water at her,

24:14.287 --> 24:15.823
and then... Look.

24:18.249 --> 24:20.581
The prophecy has come to pass.

24:21.419 --> 24:24.331
And you, Dorothy, you defeated her.

24:24.422 --> 24:25.753
With water?

24:25.882 --> 24:28.999
It was your destiny to stop her,
and destiny gave you the tool.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.217
I'm sorry.

24:31.429 --> 24:32.509
Don't be.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.005
She didn't leave you a choice.

24:36.225 --> 24:39.888
You're one of us now, Dorothy.
Part of the Sisterhood of Witches.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.805
I'm sure Oz is wonderful,

24:43.900 --> 24:45.561
but I want to go home.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.142
I understand.

24:47.236 --> 24:51.104
Unfortunately, I don't have
the power to cross realms.

24:51.658 --> 24:52.818
Only The Wizard has done that.

24:52.909 --> 24:54.991
Perhaps he can help you.

24:55.536 --> 24:58.027
I thought Zelena turned him
into a monkey.

24:59.123 --> 25:03.492
Now gone, her magic will be undone.
He will be back to his human form.

25:03.586 --> 25:05.577
Will you take me to him?

25:06.005 --> 25:07.711
Just follow me.

25:08.675 --> 25:09.755
Where?

25:09.842 --> 25:11.002
Why,

25:11.636 --> 25:14.844
down the Yellow Brick Road, of course.

25:26.693 --> 25:29.480
ZELENA: Nothing more innocent
than a newborn babe.

25:29.946 --> 25:33.279
And you, my sweet,
are the most innocent of all.

25:33.449 --> 25:36.031
The product of the truest love.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.246
See, once I change the past,

25:46.337 --> 25:49.625
you and I shall meet
under different circumstances.

25:50.925 --> 25:53.917
And, Rumple, you will choose me.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.586
And lwill be enough.

25:56.681 --> 25:57.887
No, you won't.

25:57.974 --> 26:02.559
And no matter where you go in time,
I will find a way to kill you.

26:02.812 --> 26:04.143

26:22.832 --> 26:23.992
Don't worry, dearie,

26:24.083 --> 26:27.075
once all this is over,
you won't remember a thing.

26:27.170 --> 26:29.161
DAVID: It isn't over yet.

26:29.630 --> 26:32.588
And who's gonna stop me?
Certainly not the Savior.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.342
Go. Get him. We've got your back.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.220
And I've got your heart.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.512
REGINA: Zelena, stop now.

26:44.645 --> 26:46.021
We're not going to let you succeed.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.021
Rid me of those pests.

26:51.569 --> 26:53.730
Please, no more water.

26:53.821 --> 26:56.107
Get the dagger,
then the Dark One will be on your side.

26:57.492 --> 26:58.572
That's easier said than done.

26:58.659 --> 27:01.366
Do as I say, or I will destroy you both.

27:01.913 --> 27:03.073
I have no choice.

27:04.457 --> 27:05.822
Come for another beating, sis?

27:05.917 --> 27:07.578
No, I came for some jewelry.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.712
Beautiful one, if you will?

these creatures are our friends!

27:21.307 --> 27:23.969
Don't worry. I'll use a gentle touch.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.675
Unfortunately,
that's not an option for me.

Only light magic can harm me.
And you're as dark as they come.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.864
It was your destiny to be this way.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.821
And it will also be your undoing.

27:42.912 --> 27:45.904
Don't tell me what I can be.

27:45.998 --> 27:46.987
(LAUGHS)

27:47.875 --> 27:51.038
I tried to be good once,
but it wasn't in the cards.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.289
This is who I am, and it's who you are!

27:57.468 --> 27:59.424
You're wrong, sis.

28:57.612 --> 29:00.854
Yeah, he can handle anything.

What are you waiting for? Just do it!

REGINA: N0!

29:31.395 --> 29:32.475
Enough.

29:33.522 --> 29:35.183
This ends now.

29:36.609 --> 29:40.352
After everything this witch has done,
you're gonna protect her?

29:41.197 --> 29:43.688
Good magic stopped her.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.614
And good magic
doesn't exact vengeance.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.202
She killed my son.

29:48.162 --> 29:50.619
How many lives have we taken
trying to get what we want?

Heroes don't kill.

30:00.716 --> 30:02.377
So, now, you're a hero?

30:05.096 --> 30:06.302
Today I am.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.024
Go on.

30:28.119 --> 30:29.484
Ask for him.

30:31.372 --> 30:32.862
Hello?

Your Excellency?

30:37.378 --> 30:38.367
(GASPS)

30:39.630 --> 30:41.666
WIZARD: I’ve been expecting you.

30:41.799 --> 30:42.834
You have?

30:42.925 --> 30:44.381
/ see all.

30:44.468 --> 30:48.427
/ am Oz, The Great and Terrible.

30:48.889 --> 30:50.845
My name is Dorothy Gale.

30:51.809 --> 30:55.301
Glinda said you might be able
to help me get home.

30:56.063 --> 30:57.223
To Kansas.

30:57.314 --> 30:58.850
/ know who you are.

30:58.941 --> 31:01.102
You freed me from
the Wicked Witch ’3 magic.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.651
Sending you home
is the least / can do to reward you.

31:04.739 --> 31:06.104
How do I get back?

31:06.615 --> 31:08.822
Look down.

31:14.457 --> 31:18.450
Click your heels together three times
and think of where you want to be,

31:18.544 --> 31:20.375
and the slippers shall take you there.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.753
Thank you so much.

31:22.840 --> 31:25.126
WIZARD: Safe travels, Dorothy.

31:25.217 --> 31:28.505
May you never ﬁnd yourself
far from home again.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.765
Thank you for your help.

31:43.277 --> 31:45.609
You can show your true self now.

31:45.988 --> 31:47.524
WIZARD: With pleasure.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.404
Hello, sister.

31:53.496 --> 31:55.703
Zelena? I don't understand.

31:55.790 --> 31:58.782
-Dorothy said...
-I was destroyed by water? (GIGGLES)

31:59.627 --> 32:02.369
Foolish child. So gullible.

32:02.546 --> 32:04.082
But why?

32:04.173 --> 32:05.834
Because now that she's gone,

32:05.925 --> 32:09.167
no one can stop me
from changing my past.

32:09.261 --> 32:12.003
Then I will find someone else
to fulfill the prophecy.

32:12.139 --> 32:13.254
As long as I'm in Oz,

32:13.349 --> 32:16.386
I will not stop searching
until I find someone to stop you.

32:16.519 --> 32:19.602
I suppose that means
that you need to leave Oz.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.851
Maybe you'll find the enchanted forest
more to your liking.

32:22.942 --> 32:27.686
Zelena, please, it's not too late.
You can change!

32:27.780 --> 32:29.611
Goodbye, Glinda!

32:39.708 --> 32:41.573
Why, Regina?

32:42.586 --> 32:46.670
Why notjust kill me
and put me out of my misery?

32:46.757 --> 32:50.090
Because I know
why you did what you did.

32:50.177 --> 32:52.759
We're much alike.

32:52.847 --> 32:54.758
Our mother ruined you, too.

32:55.558 --> 33:00.097
I know what it's like
to not have the life you wanted.

33:00.187 --> 33:02.724
The life you feel you deserve.

33:02.857 --> 33:03.846
Oh, boo-hoo.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.191
You know nothing.

33:08.279 --> 33:11.771
I saw it all. You had everything.

33:11.866 --> 33:13.697
Did I?

33:13.784 --> 33:16.742
So, you missed the part
where I lost the love of my life.

33:16.829 --> 33:18.820
Mother did all that
for you to achieve greatness.

33:21.959 --> 33:24.450
Not long ago, I was a lot like you.

33:25.671 --> 33:28.037
I wanted to kill someone
who wronged me.

33:28.174 --> 33:30.381
And I failed.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.835
Had I killed Snow White,
I wouldn't be in this world.

33:35.139 --> 33:40.099
I wouldn't be with these people,
and Iwouldn't have my son, Henry.

33:40.603 --> 33:42.343
So, no, Zelena.

33:42.438 --> 33:44.394
I won't kill you.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.972
Instead, I'm gonna give you what I got.

33:47.401 --> 33:49.107
I'm gonna give you a second chance.

33:50.154 --> 33:52.645
What if I don't want it?

33:52.740 --> 33:54.196
Well, that would be a mistake, dear.

33:54.909 --> 33:56.399
Take it.

33:57.119 --> 33:58.450
Use it.

33:59.914 --> 34:02.781
Evil isn't born. It's made.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.665
And so is good.

34:07.046 --> 34:08.286
If I were you,

34:10.174 --> 34:13.337
I'd consider creating a new destiny.

34:14.803 --> 34:17.385
Because if you don't,

34:17.473 --> 34:21.807
I'll be right there
to take your heart and crush it.

34:24.063 --> 34:26.475
Now, if you'll excuse me,

34:30.319 --> 34:32.184
I should put this somewhere safe.

34:45.834 --> 34:46.823
(SCOFFS)

35:35.426 --> 35:36.415
(BOTH SIGH)

35:38.846 --> 35:40.336
I knew you'd be back.

35:40.431 --> 35:44.424
Your unwavering faith

35:44.518 --> 35:46.133
constantly astounds me.

35:50.316 --> 35:52.978
And after everything I did.

35:53.068 --> 35:57.232
It wasn't you. It was Zelena.

35:59.241 --> 36:00.902
It wasn't always Zelena.

36:03.162 --> 36:08.031
I will never comprehend
why you continue to stand by my side.

36:08.542 --> 36:10.453
I love you.

36:12.212 --> 36:13.998
I always have.

36:25.768 --> 36:27.258
How did you get that?

36:28.645 --> 36:32.263
Regina gave it to me. To make amends.

36:32.941 --> 36:36.354
And also, because
she knew I wouldn't abuse its power.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.194
I want you to have it.

36:40.282 --> 36:41.442
VVhy?

36:42.701 --> 36:44.111
Because I believe in you.

36:46.997 --> 36:50.410
It's yours. You're a free man.

36:50.501 --> 36:53.413
Just promise me one thing.

36:53.504 --> 36:56.291
Promise me you won't go after Zelena.

36:57.383 --> 36:59.669
I know you're better than that.

37:04.306 --> 37:05.341
Oh, Belle.

37:12.815 --> 37:16.979
What you're giving me
is more than I can ever give you.

37:19.196 --> 37:20.777
But I will try.

37:22.366 --> 37:23.572
This?

37:25.202 --> 37:26.658
This is trust.

37:27.371 --> 37:30.454
It means you trust me
with all your heart.

37:32.251 --> 37:33.832
I do.

37:34.336 --> 37:35.872
And I shall trust you with mine.

37:37.673 --> 37:38.879
Take it.

37:40.217 --> 37:45.337
I am now, and for all the future, yours.

37:48.016 --> 37:51.258
Wait. What are you saying?

37:54.148 --> 37:55.308
Will you marry me?

37:57.359 --> 37:58.394
Yes.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.814
Yes! Yes!

38:08.704 --> 38:09.693
(SIGHS)

38:56.710 --> 38:59.201
Never thought I'd see one of those.

38:59.922 --> 39:01.253
It's called a baby.

39:01.340 --> 39:02.500
HOOK: No, Swan.

39:03.759 --> 39:04.794
A smile.

39:05.427 --> 39:07.088
We won.

39:09.890 --> 39:13.098
With all the chaos,
I never got a chance to say thank you.

39:14.144 --> 39:15.475
Did you really think I'd let you drown?

39:16.271 --> 39:19.058
Given our history,
can you blame me for being uncertain?

39:20.859 --> 39:23.475
Has your power returned
now that Zelena's been defeated?

39:24.238 --> 39:25.648
No.

39:26.073 --> 39:27.153
I'm sorry, love.

39:27.282 --> 39:30.570
It's okay. lwon't need it in New York.

39:33.121 --> 39:35.908
Hey, kid.
You wanna meet your new uncle?

40:09.741 --> 40:13.780
Regina?
I didn't expect you back so soon.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.322
I don't imagine
you expected me at all, dearie.

40:18.542 --> 40:19.531
(SIGHS)

40:20.502 --> 40:21.787
What are you doing here?

40:21.878 --> 40:24.085
What do you think?

40:24.172 --> 40:27.585
You can't kill me, Rumple.
I saw Regina take your dagger.

40:28.969 --> 40:30.425
She gave it to Belle.

40:31.346 --> 40:32.961
And she wants me dead?

40:33.056 --> 40:34.887
No, of course not.

40:35.017 --> 40:37.850
Well, then you'll have to do
what she wishes.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.261
If she has the dagger,
you have no choice.

40:41.356 --> 40:43.472
Yes. If she has the dagger.

40:44.443 --> 40:45.853
But she doesn't.

40:50.073 --> 40:51.574
She only thinks she does.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.858
You see, um,

40:54.953 --> 41:00.038
my father taught me something,
the only useful thing he passed on.

41:00.876 --> 41:04.209
A bit of sleight of hand
called "follow the lady."

41:05.797 --> 41:08.334
Belle has a fake.

41:08.425 --> 41:11.667
This, however, is quite real.

41:12.471 --> 41:15.838
Wait, wait. I'm powerless now.

41:15.932 --> 41:17.888
Regina's got my pendant.

41:18.226 --> 41:19.841
My magic's gone.

41:20.270 --> 41:21.601
I can't hurt anyone!

41:21.980 --> 41:24.517
I can't. Why? (BREATHING HEAVILY)

41:26.276 --> 41:31.020
Because I promised my son
his death would be avenged.

41:31.573 --> 41:36.408
And Rumplestiltskin
never breaks a deal.
