00:12.980 --> 00:16.350
Why does the map have to be
the actual size of the place?

00:16.416 --> 00:18.919
I don't even understand where you...

00:18.986 --> 00:21.388
"Sagrada Familia."

00:21.822 --> 00:23.123
Sagrada... Hola!

00:23.190 --> 00:25.926
Dónde está Sagrada Familia?

00:27.094 --> 00:30.531
Nothing better than people giving you
directions pointing across the city.

00:30.597 --> 00:34.101
Hola! Dónde está Sagrada Familia?

00:34.168 --> 00:37.137
Hola... is it hola or olé? Olé.

00:37.204 --> 00:41.308
Hola, señorita.
Dónde está Sagrada Familia?

00:50.484 --> 00:52.286
-Hey.
-Oh, hey. Wow, it's you.

00:52.352 --> 00:55.122
I'm trying to get to the cathedral.
Please could you help me?

00:55.155 --> 00:58.125
-Sure. I have some time.
-Great. Jump in.

00:58.158 --> 01:01.061
I'm gonna drive around Barcelona.
I need a tour guide.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.297
You know the place
like the back of your hand.

01:03.363 --> 01:04.464
On one condition.

01:04.531 --> 01:08.402
You have to lose the hat,
the sunglasses, all that tourist gear.

01:08.468 --> 01:12.573
OK. I'll save the fun for later.
Are you ready to do this?

01:12.639 --> 01:14.875
-I'm ready.
-This is great.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.643
Shakira's gonna be my tour guide.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.545
-For free.
-Hashtag winning.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.692
And this is the shimmy, boy.

02:43.230 --> 02:46.200
That's a lot of yodelling.
I don't know how I still have fans.

02:46.266 --> 02:49.169
-Why?
-So much yodelling. I've overdone it.

02:49.236 --> 02:51.839
-Let's be honest.
-Was that too much yodelling?

02:51.905 --> 02:54.107
-Too much.
-How do you do that?

02:54.107 --> 02:57.978

02:58.111 --> 02:59.746

03:02.616 --> 03:04.685
Can you say it?

03:04.751 --> 03:06.186
-I, I...
-Try it again.

03:06.253 --> 03:07.421
That's good.

03:07.487 --> 03:09.423
-Yeah?
-Now do that for 20 years.

03:09.489 --> 03:10.924
You'll get tired.

03:14.628 --> 03:18.632
If you were driving a car
and you were listening to music

03:18.699 --> 03:21.101
that you love to sing along to,
what song would you play?

03:21.168 --> 03:23.737
-I like to rock out.
-Really?

03:23.804 --> 03:26.206
Yeah. I became a pop singer,

03:26.273 --> 03:30.277
but I grew up listening to
hardcore rock music.

03:30.344 --> 03:33.347
What's a song you love singing now,
like a rock song or

03:33.413 --> 03:36.383
in that genre that touches your soul?

03:45.092 --> 03:46.960
-Are you scared?
-A little bit.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.340
Oh, I love this.

04:13.053 --> 04:16.356
Hit that snare. Hit that snare, Trevor.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.927
My hand is getting sore
from hitting the snare.

04:23.363 --> 04:25.199
Boom, boom, boom.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.970
Wow. I'll play you songs
that I listen to in the car.

05:20.787 --> 05:23.957
That is one of the greatest moments of
my life. I will store it in my memories.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.692
Rapping Wu-Tang with Shakira.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.262
-I started a new career.
-It's gonna blow up.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.964
-I'm gonna expect a cheque.
-We don't pay cheques in Africa.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.067
You send money to Africa.
We don't send money out.

You know what makes this one of
the hardest Carpool Karaokes ever?

05:42.509 --> 05:44.778
Not only do I have to sing with Shakira,

05:44.845 --> 05:49.283
one of the most amazing voices
in the world, I have to sing in Spanish.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.719
I don't even know how to speak Spanish
nor do I know how to sing.

05:53.253 --> 05:57.357
This is a hard song. It's beautiful,
but I don't know how to sing it.

05:57.424 --> 06:00.594
-It's called "Chantaje."
-Yeah. But I don't know how to sing it.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.370
-What's your hometown?
-My hometown is Johannesburg.

06:43.437 --> 06:47.407
-I got nice memories from Johannesburg.
-You do? What are your favourite memories?

06:47.474 --> 06:51.411
My love story with my baby daddy
started in Johannesburg.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.213
Oh!

06:53.280 --> 06:55.516
-You know what's funniest?
-Everything started in South Africa.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.817
I remember this.

06:56.884 --> 07:00.754
The World Cup was the biggest thing
that happened to South Africa.

07:00.821 --> 07:05.592
Shakira was singing the theme song,
and so Shakira came to South Africa...

07:06.393 --> 07:09.863
...and I got asked to host a little event.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.799
They asked you
to come teach me to Waka Waka.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.368
We did a thing together,

07:14.434 --> 07:18.071
and I was like: "I was such a good dancer,
Shakira will never forget me."

07:20.674 --> 07:23.043
-And I never did.
-I think you did.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.112
No, I never.

07:25.179 --> 07:28.348
-I think you forgot me. It's fine.
-OK...

07:28.415 --> 07:31.118
I guess I wasn't as good
at dancing as I thought.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.080
This is where you've got to go
slow motion.

09:00.574 --> 09:03.477
That's one of my favourite memories
in the whole world.

09:03.544 --> 09:06.480
-Oh, my God. I'm glad to be a part of it.
-We got to host the World Cup.

09:06.547 --> 09:10.651
You and your husband can start a country.
Soccer and music, you combine them.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.563
We're approaching
the Sagrada Familia.

09:22.629 --> 09:25.632
It's a very iconic church.
We should probably pull over.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.634
-Why?
-We should take a picture.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.504
Oh, I can't get out.
I don't know if you know this about me.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.507
I'm famous.
People are gonna be like, "Oh, my God."

09:33.574 --> 09:36.343
-I'll protect you.
-We can try, though.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.645
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, let's get out.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.482
You wanna go over there
so you can get a nicer shot?

09:42.549 --> 09:44.318
-Shakira!
-Please, guys.

09:44.384 --> 09:47.054
You got to keep them away.
There's too many fans.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.056
Her name is Shakira.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.459
When you take a selfie with a girl
you've got to go this way.

09:52.526 --> 09:53.961
Shakira, please!

09:54.061 --> 09:58.932
-I'm huge in Spain. Thank you.
-You must be famous too.

09:59.066 --> 10:02.936
Yes, it's me, Trevor. I know, yes.
Too many fans.

10:04.137 --> 10:08.575
Take a picture with my friend, Shakira.
Because you all know me already.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.144
Too much for me.
I got to get back in the car.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.113
I know. Trevor, yeah.

10:13.180 --> 10:16.783
-I love you!
-This is too stressful for me. Thank you.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.652
I am so sorry.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.488
Don't apologise.
It's normal. You're famous.

10:21.555 --> 10:24.258
-They're all shouting "Trevor".
-"Trevor, Trevor."

10:24.324 --> 10:26.260
It sounds like "Shakira", but it's not.

11:04.064 --> 11:07.801
-Half animal, half man. That's what I am.
-That's what you are.

11:10.504 --> 11:11.438
Can you do this?

11:19.980 --> 11:20.647
Can you do this?

11:23.717 --> 11:25.452
Oh, wow. Hold on.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.958
-I like the face.
-That's my move.

11:37.631 --> 11:41.969
-That's my sexy dance face.
-I see, with a Zoolander mouth.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.770
Nobody can resist it, Shakira.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.642
What do you guys call
these crossings in Spain?

11:48.709 --> 11:50.377
Paso de cebra.

11:50.444 --> 11:54.114
Paso de cebra? So it's a zebra crossing?
That's weird.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.216
In English too, right?
Zebra crossing.

11:56.283 --> 11:59.553
Where I'm from,
there's actual zebras crossing sometimes.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.857
-That was a stupid joke.
-So it's confusing.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.195
-You played the Gazelle in Zootopia?
-Yep.

12:08.262 --> 12:10.631
Did you get to choose
which animal you wanted to be?

12:10.697 --> 12:13.767
No, I didn't, but I got to give them

12:13.834 --> 12:17.404
some input on the shape
of the body of the animal.

12:17.471 --> 12:21.808
-The shape of the body of the animal?
-Yeah, because she was pretty flat.

12:21.875 --> 12:25.512
She was flat as a board.
I was like, "She needs more curves."

12:25.579 --> 12:27.281
-The gazelle needs more curves?
-Yes.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.384
I've never looked at a gazelle
and thought, "It needs more hips."

12:30.450 --> 12:34.454
She needed some... something to grab on.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.590
-Shape.
-Shape.

12:36.657 --> 12:38.091
When I was growing up,

12:38.125 --> 12:42.563
I never made it to the school choir
because my music teacher,

12:42.629 --> 12:43.997
he never liked my voice.

12:44.097 --> 12:47.801
He thought I had too much vibrato
and that I sang like a goat.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.270
I would've probably made a great goat.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.380
I can show you Barcelona
in a safer way.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.350
-With no crowds?
-Without the crowd bugging you.

13:36.783 --> 13:39.419
-I'm gonna trust you, OK.
-Trust me.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.523
-But I'm not taking any chances.
-Oh, my God.

14:03.277 --> 14:06.914
This is the greatest day
of my life!

14:07.047 --> 14:10.050
We should do this for eight more hours.
Have you got time?

14:10.117 --> 14:12.452
-I don't think so.
-Well, at least I tried.
