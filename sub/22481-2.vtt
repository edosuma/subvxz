WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.604
Previously on SWAT...
HICKS: 17-year-old young man,

00:04.105 --> 00:05.373
Raymont Harris,
was accidentally shot

00:05.406 --> 00:08.109
and seriously injured
by team leader, Buck Spivey.

00:08.142 --> 00:09.577
Now, this morning,

00:09.610 --> 00:11.612
I terminated Sergeant Spivey.

00:11.645 --> 00:15.316
Today, I am assigning command of
this unit to Sergeant Harrelson.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.351
HONDO: Deacon was up next.
JESSICA: Deacon is a good man.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.320
You lead, he'll follow.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.222
You're under
my direct command now.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.690
No relationships allowed.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.824
I asked Hicks to put Street

00:23.857 --> 00:25.559
on the team in my place.

00:25.593 --> 00:26.760
HONDO:
Lesson one, Street.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.262
Never be in a hurry to die.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.098
I can't be here to help him.
I'm hoping you will.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.402
HONDO:
20-David to Command.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.170
We've made entry.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.308
We got a meth lab.
Gonna need Hazmat.

00:40.341 --> 00:41.542
DISPATCHER:
Roger that, 20-David.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.711
Give me a two! Luca!

00:43.744 --> 00:44.678
(grunts)

00:49.650 --> 00:50.651
Two suspects in custody.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.054
Steel door.
Chris, take it.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.325
(high-pitched electrical hum)

00:57.358 --> 00:58.392
(beep)

01:02.463 --> 01:03.797
Drop it! Drop it!
Want a slug through your dome?!

01:03.831 --> 01:06.167
Down! Get down! Now!
Down! Down! Down!

01:06.200 --> 01:08.436
Put your hands on your back!
Down! Give me your hands!

01:08.469 --> 01:10.171
20-David. Clearing
the rest of the house.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.308
Right side clear.

01:14.342 --> 01:15.209
Left side clear.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.178
Runner!

01:17.211 --> 01:18.078
Street!

01:24.285 --> 01:25.586
Stay down.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.488
(quiet thump)

01:27.521 --> 01:28.822
(sighs)

01:33.627 --> 01:35.363
Always keep your head
on a swivel.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.168
Glad the rook's
on your team.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.102
Good job. Good effort.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.106
*

01:52.580 --> 01:54.148
(sighs)

02:04.858 --> 02:07.628
Hondo, your entry was fine.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.430
But your team
lost cohesion,

02:09.463 --> 02:11.332
and you paid the price.
Sergeant Mumford,

02:11.365 --> 02:12.866
when the roles
were reversed,

02:12.900 --> 02:14.268
you didn't suffer
any casualties,

02:14.302 --> 02:16.337
so your team wins
today's exercise.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.606
TAN:
Thanks, Street.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.741
You just lost me
a C-note to Rocker.

02:24.245 --> 02:27.181
Never break rank.
We move as one.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.716
I see a rabbit, I chase it.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.218
Cut the lone wolf crap.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.819
SWAT's strength
is in the pack.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.855
You want to be a hot dog,
get a job at Pink's.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.557
MUMFORD:
No big deal.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.925
It's only life or death, kid.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.393
I'm not a
practice player.

02:39.427 --> 02:41.262
I'm the guy who
shows up on game day.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.897
MUMFORD:
Let's go.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.572
(brakes squeal, hiss)

02:54.242 --> 02:56.210
(door buzzes)

02:56.244 --> 02:58.178
(chains rattling)

03:02.750 --> 03:04.685
*

03:15.896 --> 03:18.566
(elevator rumbling)

03:18.599 --> 03:20.968
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Judge Thompson,
please report to your chambers.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.937
Judge Thompson.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.339
(elevator bell dings)

03:28.709 --> 03:30.711
Primo.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.380
Damn.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.283
All right, shut your mouth
and listen up.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.450
There's no time
to cut them,

03:36.484 --> 03:37.518
so stay close.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.553
Anybody who
don't keep up

03:39.587 --> 03:41.289
gets one in the back of the head
and dragged. Got it?

03:42.623 --> 03:44.325
Hit it.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.531
(people screaming)

03:52.300 --> 03:53.301
(man shouting)

03:53.334 --> 03:54.402
Stay in there!

03:56.003 --> 03:58.238
Move it, move it, move it!

04:01.842 --> 04:03.377
(people continue screaming)

04:06.880 --> 04:08.882
(metal detector beeping)

04:23.464 --> 04:24.332
(tires screech)

04:26.734 --> 04:29.303
(tires screech)

04:31.071 --> 04:33.641
You guys got
smoked out there.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.776
Street's screw-up--
that on him or Hondo?

04:35.809 --> 04:37.445
Kid's new to SWAT.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.713
It'll take a second
to... get him together.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.715
I have my doubts
Hondo's the guy to do it.

04:41.749 --> 04:44.618
You promoted him.

04:44.652 --> 04:45.786
Optics.

04:45.819 --> 04:46.920
We had to lower

04:46.954 --> 04:48.722
the racial temperature
in the city.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.958
Now that the situation's
cooled down,

04:50.991 --> 04:53.561
Hondo's gonna have to prove
that he deserves that top spot.

04:56.464 --> 04:59.733
Need to see more
from Street, fast.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.101
You don't have to
push me to get tough.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.337
I'll get the kid
in shape.

05:03.371 --> 05:06.006
Or I'll send him packing.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.409
What do you think the big boss
is talking to Deacon about?

05:11.445 --> 05:12.446
(phone alarm beeping)

05:15.916 --> 05:18.318
Guys. Let's get
ready to go.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.527
(siren whoops, honks)

05:26.560 --> 05:27.761
(helicopter passing overhead)

05:27.795 --> 05:29.397
HICKS:
Two dead sheriff deputies,

05:29.430 --> 05:31.399
dead civilian, several wounded.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.434
The most dangerous
is Jesse Ramirez,

05:33.467 --> 05:36.437
aka Cuchillo,
Spanish for "The Knife."

05:36.470 --> 05:39.607
HICKS: Cuchillo was about to be
sentenced to life for murder,

05:39.640 --> 05:42.543
sexual assault of underage girls
and extortion.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.111
He's the brains
behind the escape.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.046
Busted out by
Ramon Reyes,

05:46.079 --> 05:48.716
Cuchillo's cousin,
long-time partner in mayhem.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.684
Disguised himself
as a sheriff's deputy.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.085
And when Cuchillo escaped,

05:52.119 --> 05:53.521
he took three other prisoners
with him.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.590
HONDO:
Jamal Goines?

05:56.624 --> 05:58.592
He's a One-Niner out of Compton.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.761
I worked a DEA task force
last year that busted Goines

06:00.794 --> 06:02.062
for moving kilos of heroin.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.931
Oh, look at this future
leader of America,

06:03.964 --> 06:05.466
Travis Strand.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.934
Member of the Nazi
Eagle prison gang,

06:06.967 --> 06:09.937
doing 15 for the armed robbery
of a marijuana dispensary.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.939
Final escapee:
Danny Wattana.

06:11.972 --> 06:15.008
Arrested LAX three days ago
on a flight from Thailand

06:15.042 --> 06:17.645
smuggling exotic turtles
strapped to his legs.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.180
HICKS:
Mumford.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.449
Your team won today's exercise.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.650
You track down Cuchillo

06:22.683 --> 06:24.652
and his cousin Reyes
and our white pride pal.

06:24.685 --> 06:27.087
Hondo, you got the One-Niner
and Reptile Man.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.523
Guess it's game time.

06:29.557 --> 06:30.390
Yeah, try not to
get yourself killed.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.861
All right, we start
with Jamal Goines.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.963
While we're hunting him down,
start making calls on Wattana.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.164
With pleasure.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.172
Jess?

06:48.175 --> 06:49.677
You know this guy, don't you?

06:52.012 --> 06:54.882
Before I made captain
and transferred to SWAT,

06:54.915 --> 06:57.451
Cuchillo was my last big arrest
in Boyle Heights.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.820
He terrorized
the neighborhood for years,

06:59.853 --> 07:01.054
and he's all about vengeance.

07:01.088 --> 07:01.822
With him on the loose...

07:01.855 --> 07:03.557
Okay, hey, hey, hey.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.925
We're going after him now.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.729
*

07:45.566 --> 07:48.736
* G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S...

07:48.769 --> 07:50.738
WOMAN (over speakers):
On your right, feast your eyes

07:50.771 --> 07:54.174
on the home of storied
screen legend, David Arquette.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.876
* Champagne

07:55.909 --> 07:57.778
* Livin' my life
in the fast lane *

07:57.811 --> 07:59.146
(siren whooping)

07:59.179 --> 08:00.548
* I won't change

08:00.581 --> 08:02.783
* For the glamorous, ooh...

08:02.816 --> 08:05.653
Sorry, folks, some kind of
misunderstanding.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.556
* The glamorous,
the glamorous, glamorous *

08:08.589 --> 08:10.223
* For the glamorous,
ooh, the flossy, flossy... *

08:10.257 --> 08:12.225
(cameras clicking)

08:13.894 --> 08:16.129
Beth Morgan?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.131
Officer, I definitely
wasn't speeding.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.833
Just wanted to have
a little chat with you

08:19.867 --> 08:21.201
about your boyfriend,
Jamal Goines.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.571
Will you step out
of the car, please?

08:29.810 --> 08:32.646
Miss, is there
still gonna be time

08:32.680 --> 08:34.615
to see Jennifer Lawrence's
house?

08:34.648 --> 08:35.849
Oh, definitely.

08:37.785 --> 08:38.719
You have absolutely no idea

08:38.752 --> 08:40.120
where Jennifer Lawrence lives,
now, do you?

08:40.153 --> 08:42.289
Shh. I need this job.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.825
HONDO: Well, you better
start talking to me, then.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.226
You ever arrest
anyone famous?

08:46.259 --> 08:47.661
Only when they deserved it.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.663
HONDO:
So, where is he?

08:49.697 --> 08:50.831
Well, Jamal didn't
call or text me.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.232
I mean, you break out of jail,

08:52.265 --> 08:53.701
you should call
your girl, right?

08:53.734 --> 08:55.135
According to the visitor log
at Men's Central,

08:55.168 --> 08:58.005
you visited Jamal every week
for the past three months.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.608
And the last time, you got
caught smuggling in vape pens.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.142
I shouldn't have done that.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.211
But the restrictions in there
are totally ridiculous.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.179
Where you from, Beth?
Duluth.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.314
What's a nice gal
out of Minnesota

09:07.347 --> 09:08.816
doing with a bad
boy like Goines?

09:08.849 --> 09:10.651
Don't tell me opposites attract.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.219
We met at this club.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.688
Jamal knew this agent
who owed him money,

09:14.722 --> 09:16.256
said he'd set me up
with a few auditions.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.157
Been having trouble
getting producers

09:17.190 --> 09:18.992
to see me as a leading lady,
you know?

09:19.026 --> 09:19.927
Come on now, Beth.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.595
You just wanted to
have some fun, right?

09:21.629 --> 09:24.064
Maybe piss off your parents
a little bit?

09:24.097 --> 09:26.099
You do know this chump
is only using you.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.702
And, look,
I need to know,

09:28.736 --> 09:30.203
if not to you,
where would he go?

09:32.339 --> 09:33.674
Little Red.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.375
They grew up together.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.678
And Jamal and Red
are usually up to no good.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.046
Maybe I should
get your number,

09:39.079 --> 09:40.914
in case I see anything
illegal while I'm in town.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.650
Sure.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.351
You spot
anything suspicious,

09:44.384 --> 09:46.253
definitely hit me up.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.688
Seriously?

09:49.056 --> 09:51.725
HONDO:
Now, listen up, Beth.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.060
Stay away from him.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.262
All right,
ladies and gents,

09:55.295 --> 09:57.230
we're gonna let you off
with a warning today.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.066
Tell Miss Lawrence I said hi.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.834
Thank you.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.773
There you go.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.677
*

10:24.424 --> 10:26.359
So, where is it?

10:42.175 --> 10:45.078
Paid a coyote
to take us south tonight.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.279
Isn't that twisted?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.948
(speaks Spanish)

10:47.981 --> 10:49.449
We don't leave tonight.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.853
Two pieces of business first.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.187
(knife slices)

10:54.221 --> 10:55.989
(Jessica speaking Spanish)

11:11.071 --> 11:13.340
Casper.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.375
You're getting so tall.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.844
What's wrong, Mama?

11:16.877 --> 11:18.912
Nothing, baby.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.181
Miss Jessica is
just here to...

11:21.214 --> 11:22.783
check up on us.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.217
Is Cuchillo coming back?

11:26.754 --> 11:30.724
Cuchillo won't hurt you,
or your sister or your mother.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.692
That's a promise.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.001
(dogs barking in distance)

11:43.136 --> 11:45.305
DEACON:
Well, we got eyes on Little Red,

11:45.338 --> 11:47.407
but no sign of Jamal.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.242
Maybe that was him
on the phone.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.311
Or he could just be
keeping out of sight.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.913
Well, we bust in
and Jamal's not there,

11:52.946 --> 11:55.048
we blow our one lead.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.250
Little Red, he'll take us
to him eventually.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.521
What do you
think, Chris?

12:01.554 --> 12:03.824
Do you remember
that suspect in K-Town?

12:03.857 --> 12:05.358
We scoped his place
for three days,

12:05.392 --> 12:07.060
and the whole time,
he was hiding under the mattress

12:07.094 --> 12:08.796
with a box of protein bars
and a piss jar.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.364
But, hey,
I'll take the overtime.

12:11.398 --> 12:15.035
They pay us to sit on our
asses or to grab up bad guys?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.436
We don't know
he's inside.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.805
We don't know he isn't.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.842
Every minute we're sitting here

12:21.875 --> 12:25.045
is a minute we're not chasing
the other three fugitives.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.847
I say we wait.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.354
We're going in.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.959
(pounding on door)

12:38.992 --> 12:41.194
Let us in and
I won't ask you

12:41.228 --> 12:43.296
how you got the
nickname Little Red.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.467
Since y'all made the trip.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.902
Go.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.176
All clear.

13:01.048 --> 13:04.818
Vape pens and about
a year's supply of hash oil.

13:04.852 --> 13:05.986
I got a medical card for that.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.587
Oh, yeah?
What you suffering from?

13:07.620 --> 13:09.356
You know, police brutality.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.858
HONDO:
You tell us where he is,

13:10.891 --> 13:12.459
we walk out of here,
never met you.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.895
(sighs)

13:14.928 --> 13:16.496
All right, yeah, J called me.

13:16.529 --> 13:17.931
We're supposed
to link up later on,

13:17.965 --> 13:19.332
so I can drive him to Vegas.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.334
Where you supposed to meet him?
Wasn't set, man.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.371
Said I should call him
once I got the pipes and a car.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.576
Make that call.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.078
(sighs)

13:33.346 --> 13:35.382
On speaker.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.919
(line ringing)

13:38.952 --> 13:39.519
GOINES:
Yo, Red, what's the news?

13:39.552 --> 13:41.221
Yeah, man.
I got the car.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.522
The police are here!
Toss the cell!

13:42.555 --> 13:44.424
Don't come near me!

13:44.457 --> 13:46.426
(sighs)

13:46.459 --> 13:48.161
That was cold, Red.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.596
Do what you got to do.

13:49.629 --> 13:50.964
Hands behind your head.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.575
So, you arrested someone
who isn't on the fugitive list?

14:02.609 --> 14:04.577
He was supposed
to get us to Jamal,

14:04.611 --> 14:06.079
but instead he tipped him off.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.984
I screwed up.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.153
Deacon tried to warn me,
but seeing him

14:13.186 --> 14:14.554
huddled up with Hicks
like that this morning,

14:14.587 --> 14:16.990
I don't know, it just...

14:17.024 --> 14:19.126
maybe it's got me
making moves I shouldn't.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.860
Stick to your list, and
I'll keep Hicks off your back.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.936
I read Cuchillo's file.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.438
You convinced a woman
to testify against him.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.440
Sofia Jememez.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.442
Single mom.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.211
She stood up in court against
him when no one else would.

14:38.245 --> 14:41.214
I promised I'd keep her
and her children safe.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.150
And Hicks won't sign off
on extra protection.

14:43.183 --> 14:46.119
All right, I'll swing by
and check in on her.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.387
That a personal favor
or a professional one?

14:47.420 --> 14:48.922
Professional.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.423
I mean, I don't really know

14:50.457 --> 14:51.925
what our personal relationship
is these days.

14:54.661 --> 14:57.197
I'm your boss now.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.532
Being together
could cost us our jobs.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.668
Jess, it's a stupid
department policy.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.104
It's dangerous.
Right.

15:04.137 --> 15:08.341
I'd really hate to find myself
doing something dangerous.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.276
(chuckles softly)

15:17.550 --> 15:20.220
Any leads
on the Lizard King?

15:20.253 --> 15:22.489
TAN: Travels back and forth
from Thailand every month,

15:22.522 --> 15:24.724
so we alerted TSA in case
he tries swiping his passport.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.559
Yeah, and the only permanent
address the guy had

15:26.593 --> 15:29.096
the last few years is a
garage in North Hollywood.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.563
We talked to
the manager;

15:30.597 --> 15:32.966
he's gonna text me if
Turtle Man shows up.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.534
And we got the dirt on Street.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.140
Street.
Yo?

15:40.173 --> 15:42.742
Grab the GPS unit
out of Black Betty, will you?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.411
What? 'Cause of
this morning?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.213
I'm the errand boy now?

15:46.246 --> 15:49.016
Something like that.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.324
Okay, on the plus side,

15:57.357 --> 15:59.526
Street was a kick-ass copper
down in Long Beach.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.061
He has tons of righteous busts.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.629
TAN:
On the flip side,

16:02.662 --> 16:04.998
dude's racked up an inch worth
of disciplinary charges,

16:05.032 --> 16:06.633
and he's been transferred
between units.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.700
Doesn't play well with others.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.502
He told me his mom's in prison.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.004
You find out why?

16:11.038 --> 16:13.240
Yeah.
She's doing 25 to life

16:13.273 --> 16:14.741
for killing his old man.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.509
I mean, after a dozen

16:16.543 --> 16:21.114
domestic abuse calls to 911,
Street's mom popped his dad

16:21.148 --> 16:22.682
twice in the chest
with his own gun.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.785
Guess who the
arresting officer was.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.354
Buck Spivey.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.755
Yeah.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.757
Street was 12 when it went down.

16:30.790 --> 16:33.493
After that, he got passed around
the foster care system.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.028
Explains a few things.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.663
Yeah. Dealt a tough hand.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.265
But that doesn't mean

16:38.298 --> 16:39.666
he gets a free ride with SWAT.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.602
When Buck got fired,

16:42.635 --> 16:44.737
he handpicked Street
to take his place.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.540
I get we're not feeling
the kid just yet, but...

16:47.574 --> 16:49.442
we all owe Buck.

16:49.476 --> 16:52.745
So, before we go pulling
the ripcord on Street,

16:52.779 --> 16:54.581
let's try to make him better.

16:57.650 --> 17:01.454
What, we headed out?

17:01.488 --> 17:04.057
Mr. Master Race thought
he'd rob a check cashing place

17:04.091 --> 17:05.458
and throw some shots at us.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.659
He was a little slow.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.229
His aim was worse.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.830
Scoop up any of
your guys yet, Hondo?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.432
Not yet.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.201
Guess it's one-zero.

17:16.503 --> 17:19.339
Isn't even halftime yet.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.573
Look, no hands.

17:20.607 --> 17:21.741
(quiet thump)

17:23.810 --> 17:25.445
Too easy.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.480
MUMFORD: How many times
I got to tell you?

17:27.514 --> 17:29.249
Keep your head
on a swivel.

17:35.355 --> 17:36.689
We're not gonna let
Cuchillo or his cousin

17:36.723 --> 17:39.826
hurt you or your kids.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.629
Casper, baby, come here.

17:45.598 --> 17:49.202
The day after I saw him
kill my neighbor...

17:52.272 --> 17:54.174
...this is how I found Casper.

17:55.875 --> 18:00.380
A message from
Cuchillo not to talk.

18:00.413 --> 18:04.083
I never regretted testifying,
until right now.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.258
(sighs) Ma'am.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.825
When I was a kid,

18:12.859 --> 18:14.461
I had to walk past
this high roller

18:14.494 --> 18:16.629
every day on the way to school.

18:16.663 --> 18:19.299
He was always messing with me,
wanting me to slang dope.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.268
Now, I just wanted
to change schools,

18:21.301 --> 18:23.603
but my mother, she
was not having it.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.506
She stepped right up to him
and got in his face.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.509
Told him to keep away from me
and my friends or she would have

18:29.542 --> 18:32.279
every cop in the 77th Division
knowing his name.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.616
He never bothered me again.

18:36.649 --> 18:39.686
You had a brave mother.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.188
And so do your kids.

18:43.256 --> 18:46.159
If people like you
don't take risks,

18:46.193 --> 18:47.126
more people will get hurt.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.770
I'm gonna have
two of my team detail

18:57.804 --> 19:00.139
to watch over you and your
family until we catch him.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.210
(sobs softly)

19:04.444 --> 19:06.446
You can't spare two officers.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.947
We'll manage.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.882
Hicks won't sign off on this.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.918
Sometimes following the rules
and doing what's right

19:11.951 --> 19:13.786
isn't always the same thing.

19:16.623 --> 19:17.590
(sighs)

19:17.624 --> 19:19.259
If you were brave enough
to stand up to Cuchillo,

19:19.292 --> 19:22.629
the LAPD's gonna
stand up for you.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.231
Thank you.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.173
(bicycle bell dinging)

19:39.512 --> 19:41.381
You here 'cause of Cuchillo?

19:41.414 --> 19:42.749
There's a reward.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.884
So if he's hiding in
your bunk bed, you let us know.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.654
(bicycle bell dinging)

19:47.687 --> 19:49.722
Chris, Street.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.324
You're gonna park here,
look after Sofia and her kids.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.659
Babysitting?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.228
Sofia put Cuchillo behind bars.

19:55.262 --> 19:56.596
He might come after her.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.831
All right.
I'd love to haul his ass in

19:58.865 --> 20:00.567
just to see Mumford
and Rocker's faces.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.973
Me and Street in close quarters?
You hoping I'll kill him?

20:07.006 --> 20:09.409
I'm hoping you can get him to
realize this team is a family

20:09.442 --> 20:11.744
and right now he's
the black sheep.

20:11.778 --> 20:12.879
I'll do what I can.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.281
(phone beeps)

20:14.314 --> 20:15.348
LUCA:
Yo, Hondo.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.317
The manager of
the garage texted.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.718
Guess who just showed up.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.523
SWAT!
Hands where we can see them!

20:25.024 --> 20:27.394
I swear I was gonna
turn myself in.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.696
Oh, hell no.
But they haven't been
fed in a week.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.465
Tan, call Animal Control.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.301
Luca, get that thing off of him.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.303
What? Why me?

20:36.336 --> 20:37.604
I don't mess
with snakes. Go.

20:37.637 --> 20:38.571
He gets two medium rats,

20:38.605 --> 20:39.939
and the turtles need
a very specific diet.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.341
(snake hissing)

20:41.374 --> 20:42.742
I'll-I'll write it down for you.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.377
(Luca groaning)

20:52.419 --> 20:54.387
(Luca groaning)

21:04.931 --> 21:06.599
So about this tension

21:06.633 --> 21:09.469
neither one of us
wants to talk about.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.937
Look, it's got to suck
to get passed over

21:10.970 --> 21:12.705
for a job that you deserve.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.607
But right or wrong,
that's how it played out, man.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.075
Hicks made his decision.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.044
He named you team leader;
I'll honor that.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.550
You wanted to sit on
Little Red longer,

21:23.583 --> 21:25.084
and I should've
listened to you.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.820
I wanted to prove
that I knew better, and...

21:27.854 --> 21:29.489
that's my bad; I'm sorry.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.057
I appreciate that.

21:31.090 --> 21:34.727
You know, Buck used to take all
our ideas into consideration.

21:34.761 --> 21:35.762
Yeah, he did.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.564
I got my own thoughts, Deac,
but I am curious.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.366
If you were
team leader,

21:39.399 --> 21:42.869
how would you track
down Jamal now?

21:42.902 --> 21:44.671
(sighs)

21:44.704 --> 21:46.573
Well, we still got
Little Red in custody.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.408
Yeah.
I'd take
a second run at him.

21:48.441 --> 21:49.576
With what?

21:49.609 --> 21:51.811
Absolutely nothing.

21:55.047 --> 21:57.417
Time to head back to
Corcoran, Little Red.

21:57.450 --> 21:58.851
Behind an
obstruction charge?

21:58.885 --> 22:00.119
Please. What's that?

22:00.152 --> 22:02.555
A 30-day spa vacation in County?

22:02.589 --> 22:04.691
Let's not forget
aiding and abetting.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.693
It's kind of sad, if you ask me.
I mean, come on, man.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.661
Three years
just so you could buy Jamal

22:08.695 --> 22:09.929
three extra hours of freedom.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.364
What are you saying?

22:11.398 --> 22:12.832
We snatched Jamal up
an hour ago,

22:12.865 --> 22:14.434
so that little warning
you gave him

22:14.467 --> 22:15.668
on the phone was
all for nothing.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.103
Except buying you
a felony charge.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.571
Think I'm gonna fall for the

22:18.605 --> 22:22.742
"we got your partner
in the next room" trick?

22:22.775 --> 22:24.711
You want to hear
how we did it?

22:24.744 --> 22:26.112
Jamal's tour bus
girlfriend tells us

22:26.145 --> 22:28.448
he was owed a debt
from a big heroin deal

22:28.481 --> 22:29.782
that happened right
before he got arrested.

22:29.816 --> 22:31.384
Red, I'm from
South L.A.

22:31.418 --> 22:33.119
I know every dope spot,
trap house,

22:33.152 --> 22:34.887
crooked corner store
spinning down there.

22:34.921 --> 22:37.390
Wasn't really that
hard to find him.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.392
Just a damn shame
he tried shooting his way out.

22:39.426 --> 22:40.593
Lot of collateral damage.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.695
We hit him,
he hit a few of his friends.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.431
Man, your boy has bad aim.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.065
They're all at St. Francis's
Trauma Center as we speak.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.667
If he gets out of surgery,

22:47.700 --> 22:49.168
he's facing multiple
life sentences.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.970
Who else got shot?
HONDO:
Why do you care?

22:51.003 --> 22:54.541
You got your own problems now,
player.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.545
J-Just tell me.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.447
Did Donna get shot?

23:02.515 --> 23:04.083
Donna.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.020
Donna Shaw.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.890
That's your
half-sister, huh?

23:10.923 --> 23:12.725
Says here, she signed her name

23:12.759 --> 23:14.894
on over half a dozen
bail bonds contracts for you.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.996
Man, she must love you.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.965
Is that who you're
so worried about?

23:18.998 --> 23:21.000
Donna's my blood, man.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.802
Just tell me she all right.

23:22.835 --> 23:25.171
Donna put up a club on Western
as collateral for bail once.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.440
Which means she owns it.
Maybe Jamal goes there to get

23:27.474 --> 23:29.008
the money he's owed.
Or he's hiding out
at the place.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.043
Either way, that's a good bet
that's where we find him.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.179
Wait a minute.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.715
I didn't say nothing
about Donna's place.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.983
You telling me
there was no shooting?

23:37.016 --> 23:38.651
Jamal's still out there?

23:38.685 --> 23:40.019
You just said
you weren't gonna fall

23:40.052 --> 23:41.621
for the "partner in
the next room" trick.

23:41.654 --> 23:42.589
We had to go with
something else.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.857
HONDO: We're gonna drop in
on Jamal and Donna,

23:44.891 --> 23:47.560
make sure they're both fine.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.662
Now, that's cold.

23:56.035 --> 23:59.672
(bicycle bell dinging)

23:59.706 --> 24:02.008
HONDO:
20-David to Command.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.142
We have Jamal Goines in custody.

24:03.175 --> 24:04.611
Great.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.012
All the action's out there.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.780
We're here parked
on our asses.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.716
(sighs)

24:09.749 --> 24:11.984
Been watching you swiping.
What are you on, Tinder?

24:12.018 --> 24:13.152
No, that's played out.

24:13.185 --> 24:15.254
I'm on a few new ones.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.724
Bumble, Happn, Hinge,
Coffee meets Bagel.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.559
Hmm.

24:19.592 --> 24:20.793
Covering
your bases.
Mm.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.495
I'm actually
on Bumble.

24:22.529 --> 24:23.696
I know.
I saw your profile.

24:23.730 --> 24:26.599
You love The Smiths,
free weights

24:26.633 --> 24:28.701
and German shepherds.

24:28.735 --> 24:31.137
Oh, and kudos on that
selfie, by the way.

24:31.170 --> 24:34.473
That sports bra showed just
enough without seeming skanky.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.978
You, uh, swiping
right on me?

24:39.011 --> 24:41.047
Deleting my profile.

24:41.080 --> 24:41.914
(chuckles softly)

24:44.150 --> 24:47.820
Hey, um...

24:47.854 --> 24:51.658
when Hondo sent me
to fetch that GPS unit,

24:51.691 --> 24:53.860
felt like it was
to get me out of the room.

24:55.562 --> 24:57.630
Anything I should know about?

24:57.664 --> 25:01.033
Luca's got a friend
in Long Beach PD.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.035
We got your jacket.

25:03.069 --> 25:05.672
What was
your favorite part?

25:07.640 --> 25:09.075
We found the file
on your mom.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.746
Sorry you had to
go through that.

25:13.780 --> 25:17.149
Foster care all
those years.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.886
How'd you get
through that?

25:19.919 --> 25:21.588
(bicycle bell dings)

25:21.621 --> 25:23.556
STREET:
What's with this kid?

25:25.257 --> 25:27.226
Man, Cuchillo ever
gonna show up or what?

25:27.259 --> 25:28.628
CASPER:
Cuchillo...

25:28.661 --> 25:29.996
is coming here?

25:32.064 --> 25:34.133
Hey.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.035
Casper, right?

25:42.174 --> 25:44.110
You know Cuchillo?

25:44.143 --> 25:45.912
If he's dumb enough
to show up here,

25:45.945 --> 25:48.180
he's in for a big surprise,
believe me.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.057
You know,
your mom-- she's...

25:58.090 --> 26:00.593
she's really scared.

26:00.627 --> 26:03.863
That means you got to be the man
of the house, keep her calm.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.901
A long time ago,

26:08.935 --> 26:13.072
police officer
gave me this watch.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.741
His name's Buck.

26:14.774 --> 26:18.210
He met me when I was
really scared.

26:20.312 --> 26:22.749
I want you to have it.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.150
Here.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.918
Now, Buck

26:25.952 --> 26:29.388
taught me something
called "equal breathing."

26:29.421 --> 26:31.223
You see
the second hand here?

26:31.257 --> 26:34.093
So, I want you to breathe in,

26:34.126 --> 26:36.796
take deep breaths in,
in through your nose,

26:36.829 --> 26:38.798
and make 'em last
for a count of four seconds.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.900
Then you exhale
for a count of four.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.870
Then you do the same thing,
but for a count of six seconds.

26:43.903 --> 26:46.639
The goal is to try
to hit eight seconds in

26:46.673 --> 26:48.808
and eight seconds out.

26:48.841 --> 26:51.343
And once you're there,
you're in a calm place.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.245
Think you can do that?

26:53.279 --> 26:55.614
I'll try.

27:02.154 --> 27:03.690
(quietly):
What?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.961
(siren wailing in distance)

27:08.995 --> 27:09.996
(indistinct chatter)

27:14.133 --> 27:15.434
I thought you had
the One-Niner in custody?

27:15.467 --> 27:17.336
We do. He's in the trunk.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.371
We picked him up at Little Red's
half-sister's club.

27:19.405 --> 27:20.940
Tried to bring him in
the old-fashioned way,

27:20.973 --> 27:22.208
but he started
kicking out windows.

27:22.241 --> 27:23.375
Yeah, dude's hopped up
on something nasty.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.011
He put up a wicked big fight.

27:25.044 --> 27:26.746
Yeah. He got in a
good shot on Tan.

27:26.779 --> 27:27.747
HONDO: Trust me,
it was either kill him

27:27.780 --> 27:28.748
or put him in the trunk

27:28.781 --> 27:29.849
and come up with a plan B.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.183
You sure he's okay?

27:31.217 --> 27:33.152
One way to find out.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.224
Hey, Jamal, we're gonna
let you out of there,

27:38.257 --> 27:39.358
but I'm telling you,

27:39.391 --> 27:41.427
you better come out peacefully.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.767
(sighs)
Man.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.468
Everybody back up.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.738
Back up.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.742
(gun racks)
Go.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.719
(yelling wildly, grunting)

28:08.454 --> 28:10.189
(electrical buzzing)

28:11.323 --> 28:13.692
(groaning)

28:16.428 --> 28:19.131
Okay, let's
go, big boy.

28:25.772 --> 28:28.274
So, you get Cuchillo
and his cousin yet?

28:28.307 --> 28:29.308
We're closer.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.343
That means you're nowhere.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.479
Looks like it's two-one.

28:45.091 --> 28:47.226
Hey.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.395
What's your plan
to get Cuchillo?

28:49.428 --> 28:51.898
I got my team filling
the gaps in Boyle Heights

28:51.931 --> 28:53.265
where Mumford
and his boys aren't.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.267
Tracking everyone
he and his cousin know

28:55.301 --> 28:57.003
and everywhere they like to go.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.270
If they have any brains,
they'll be halfway

28:58.304 --> 28:59.806
to Jalisco by now.
Come on, Jess.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.774
You know criminals.
Brains aren't a requirement.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.346
Your famous gumbo?

29:07.379 --> 29:09.448
Mm-hmm.

29:09.481 --> 29:12.018
I miss your gumbo.

29:12.051 --> 29:15.187
Whenever you want some,
you just got to say the word.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.924
(chuckles)

29:17.957 --> 29:20.292
This batch is for
Sofia and her kids.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.461
I have no idea how long
they're gonna be locked up

29:22.494 --> 29:24.496
with Chris and
Street, so...

29:24.530 --> 29:27.166
figured the least I could
do is cook for 'em all.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.471
(zips bag)

29:32.504 --> 29:34.106
Something's bothering you.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.345
Hicks said something that
I've been trying to figure out.

29:39.378 --> 29:42.014
What's that?
He asked me
to speed up the evaluations

29:42.048 --> 29:43.950
from the training
exercise this morning.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.351
So?

29:45.384 --> 29:46.986
So, it's unusual.

29:47.019 --> 29:48.888
The only reason to do it is

29:48.921 --> 29:50.256
to create a fast
paper trail on someone.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.424
What, Street?

29:52.458 --> 29:55.127
We'll get the kid in line
before Hicks can move on him.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.129
I don't think it's about Street.

29:58.865 --> 30:01.800
You think he's coming after me.

30:04.003 --> 30:06.205
Man, how'd this turn
into a dog-walking gig?

30:06.238 --> 30:08.140
You don't like dogs?

30:08.174 --> 30:10.309
No, I like petting 'em.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.444
I just don't really like
cleaning up after 'em.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.480
Well, you don't get one
without the other.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.883
You got to put in the work to
get the reward, just like SWAT.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.050
Oh, is that what
we're talking about?

30:18.084 --> 30:19.986
SWAT?
No, we're talking
about family.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.888
Caring about the person
next to you enough

30:21.921 --> 30:23.856
to put in the work
to doing things right.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.524
Is this why Hondo
put us together?

30:25.557 --> 30:27.326
So you could
teach me a lesson?

30:28.627 --> 30:30.529
To help you clean up your mess.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.498
SWAT is a family.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.200
And if you don't start
treating it like it,

30:34.233 --> 30:36.368
Hondo's gonna have to bust you
down to patrol.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.237
I'll be fine.

30:38.270 --> 30:40.206
I'm used to people turning
their backs on me anyway.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.440
You're up.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.409
(sighs)

30:45.544 --> 30:47.479
Ugh. God.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.654
(chuckles)

30:55.687 --> 30:58.157
Who says SWAT isn't glamorous?

30:58.190 --> 30:59.525
(chuckles)

31:01.593 --> 31:04.130
Oh, that was luck.
Wow.

31:04.163 --> 31:07.466
Well, here's some food
to get you all through the day.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.268
See that baby cholo?

31:09.301 --> 31:12.404
He's been cruising
the block all night.

31:12.438 --> 31:14.173
Now he's got a knife.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.942
Maybe doing recon for Cuchillo.

31:18.277 --> 31:19.445
Yo, kid.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.113
(bicycle bell dings)

31:21.147 --> 31:22.881
Come talk to me for a second.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.452
Nice ride.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.159
I got one just like this.

31:33.192 --> 31:35.161
I use mine to chop onions.
What you cooking?

31:35.194 --> 31:37.529
Nothing.
Then why are you doing
drive-bys?

31:37.563 --> 31:39.265
Cuchillo send you
to keep eyes on this place?

31:39.298 --> 31:41.367
Nah. I see Cuchillo,
I'm gonna cut him,

31:41.400 --> 31:43.702
like he cut my dad.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.438
What'd he do
to your pops?

31:46.472 --> 31:48.440
Sliced his finger off
for scratching his car.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.076
So what?
You see Cuchillo,

31:50.109 --> 31:51.978
you gonna take care of him
yourself, is that it?

31:52.011 --> 31:54.213
Don't see anybody else doing it.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.048
You hear anything
from anyone in the neighborhood?

31:56.082 --> 31:58.184
Where he might be,
where he might've gone?

31:58.217 --> 32:00.052
Nah. Everyone's
hiding from him.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.088
My cousin Ariel--

32:02.121 --> 32:04.723
my uncle's kept her home
from school till they catch him.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.959
I've been doing circles
around her place, too.

32:06.993 --> 32:09.295
Ariel? What's Cuchillo
want with her?

32:09.328 --> 32:10.629
To be her first.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.198
Ariel just turned 16.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.266
He's been obsessed
with her for a while.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.601
Told my uncle
he was gonna marry her someday.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.503
Show me where Ariel lives.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.074
(crying)

32:22.108 --> 32:25.277
(Angel groans)

32:25.311 --> 32:27.679
You thought you were
gonna keep us apart?

32:27.713 --> 32:29.448
Hmm?

32:29.481 --> 32:31.450
Never.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.685
Not you,

32:33.719 --> 32:36.488
not jail, not the cops.

32:36.522 --> 32:37.589
She's not yours.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.358
Because she doesn't
know me yet!

32:39.391 --> 32:40.993
(Ariel sobs)

32:42.561 --> 32:45.131
Because you

32:45.164 --> 32:46.632
kept her away from me.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.302
I put guards
in the ground for her.

32:50.336 --> 32:51.137
Please.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.440
If you stop hurting him,
I'll go with you.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.209
Baby girl,

32:57.243 --> 32:58.610
I just want his blessing.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.347
She doesn't want you.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.315
(bicycle bell dinging outside)

33:14.226 --> 33:14.993
(muffled scream)

33:17.263 --> 33:18.997
I'll let her know
what she wants.

33:20.566 --> 33:21.567
Under the stars.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.734
(crying)

33:22.768 --> 33:23.635
(screams)

33:25.771 --> 33:27.273
(crying):
Daddy.

33:27.306 --> 33:28.774
(groaning)

33:29.841 --> 33:31.610
(knock on door)

33:31.643 --> 33:33.045
ANGEL:
Help me!

33:33.079 --> 33:35.581
(groaning)

33:35.614 --> 33:36.482
Where is he?!
Where is he?!

33:36.515 --> 33:38.317
He took her.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.086
(engine revving)

33:44.623 --> 33:45.757
(tires screech)

33:45.791 --> 33:47.259
(groaning)

33:47.293 --> 33:48.794
All right, all right.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.396
I got you, I got you.

33:51.563 --> 33:52.831
I need deep breaths.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.200
You hear me?
Give me deep breaths.

33:54.233 --> 33:56.402
Slow, deep breaths.
(radio clicks)

33:56.435 --> 33:59.805
20-David to Command.
I got a 187 suspect.

33:59.838 --> 34:01.507
He's driving
a red Chevy pickup,

34:01.540 --> 34:04.210
plate number Mary-4-3-2-5-2.

34:04.243 --> 34:07.513
I repeat, Mary-4-3-2-5-2.

34:07.546 --> 34:08.847
He's headed northbound
from my location.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.116
Be advised,

34:10.149 --> 34:12.284
he has a kidnap
victim inside.

34:12.318 --> 34:14.320
You're gonna be all right.
Talk to me.

34:14.353 --> 34:15.554
Do you have any idea
where he's taking her?

34:15.587 --> 34:17.189
He talked about a cabin.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.657
He said you can see the sky
clear from there.

34:18.690 --> 34:19.658
(groans)

34:19.691 --> 34:21.327
(radio beeps)

34:21.360 --> 34:22.694
Honda to Deac.
Honda to Deac. You there?

34:22.728 --> 34:24.363
DEACON:
Yeah. What's up?

34:24.396 --> 34:26.165
I need you to check
something out for me.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.635
Ran down the addresses of all of

34:29.668 --> 34:31.403
Cuchillo's associates
and family members.

34:31.437 --> 34:33.205
His aunt, Estrella Ramirez,

34:33.239 --> 34:35.374
owned a cabin out in
Sunland for 20 years.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.443
Seems Estrella had a
breakdown a couple years back

34:37.476 --> 34:39.278
and now resides at a psych
hospital in Bakersfield.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.213
She still own the cabin?
Yeah.

34:41.247 --> 34:42.414
Unoccupied.

34:42.448 --> 34:44.150
Well, it's something,
and time's ticking.

34:44.183 --> 34:45.451
All right, grab Deacon.

34:45.484 --> 34:47.886
Let's gear up.
Let's go.

34:47.919 --> 34:51.723
Deac, what do you know about
Hondo planting SWAT team members

34:51.757 --> 34:54.160
on a witness
instead of keeping them fluid?

34:54.193 --> 34:56.162
Look, whatever this is
with you and Hondo,

34:56.195 --> 34:57.663
I don't want to be
in the middle of it.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.165
Well, you are
in the middle of it.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.233
I'm thinking maybe you'd make
a better team captain.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.302
You want to knock Hondo
down a peg?

35:03.335 --> 35:04.270
Do it without me.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.577
DISPATCHER: Fugitive alert
for Jesse "Cuchillo" Ramirez.

35:11.610 --> 35:14.213
SWAT teams en route
to Sunland-Tujunga.

35:14.246 --> 35:16.682
Sunland, great.
Nowhere near here.

35:16.715 --> 35:18.517
You know, most of us
consider it a good day

35:18.550 --> 35:19.685
when we don't get shot at.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.587
(dog barks, growls)

35:21.620 --> 35:24.290
He's not usually a barker.

35:24.323 --> 35:27.125
(barking continues)

35:31.263 --> 35:34.233
It's Reyes, Cuchillo's cousin.

35:34.266 --> 35:36.235
Come on, come on,
come on!

35:36.268 --> 35:37.903
Wait, go. Guys, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.171
What's happening?

35:39.205 --> 35:40.672
It's okay.
It's okay.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.274
Just get in and stay down.
Is he here?

35:42.308 --> 35:43.742
Just get in and stay down.
Is he here?

35:43.775 --> 35:45.711
Hey, I want you to watch the
hand and count your breaths.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.279
Four, six, eight.
Remember?

35:48.547 --> 35:50.516
Shh, shh.

35:50.549 --> 35:51.550
Shh.

35:52.551 --> 35:53.319
(screams)

35:58.690 --> 35:59.858
(crying)

35:59.891 --> 36:01.860
(clattering in other room)

36:01.893 --> 36:03.629
(clattering stops)

36:12.271 --> 36:13.772
We're good.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.741
*

36:31.790 --> 36:34.226
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

36:43.602 --> 36:46.805
Well, it's definitely
Estrella Ramirez's cabin.

36:46.838 --> 36:49.508
And that's the girl's father's
stolen truck. All right.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.809
Check out the
three side.

36:50.842 --> 36:51.910
Let me know
what you see.
Okay.

36:55.914 --> 36:57.549
(rapid gunfire)

36:57.583 --> 36:58.584
Shots fired!
Shots fired!

36:58.617 --> 37:00.852
Take cover!

37:00.886 --> 37:02.754
(gunfire continues)

37:02.788 --> 37:05.023
50-David to Command.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.993
Suspect is barricaded inside,
armed with fully-auto.

37:08.026 --> 37:10.829
Be advised, suspect has
position of advantage.

37:10.862 --> 37:14.366
(gunfire continues)

37:14.400 --> 37:16.768
No way around.
Windows are covered.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.338
No clear shot without
putting the girl at risk.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.308
(Ariel grunting)

37:23.742 --> 37:25.477
(urgent chatter)

37:27.746 --> 37:29.281
Everyone okay?

37:29.315 --> 37:30.382
¿Está bien?

37:32.551 --> 37:33.719
They saved us.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.354
(crying)

37:38.790 --> 37:40.459
30-David to Command.
(gunfire continues)

37:40.492 --> 37:41.827
We're taking
shots here.

37:41.860 --> 37:42.928
(over radio):
We've located Cuchillo,

37:42.961 --> 37:44.596
but he's got
the high ground on us.

37:44.630 --> 37:45.764
HONDO:
This is Hondo to Deac.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.466
Hold it down.
I'm on my way.

37:47.499 --> 37:48.367
What do you need?

37:53.639 --> 37:55.374
(rapid gunfire)

38:08.420 --> 38:10.055
(crying)

38:10.088 --> 38:12.991
DEACON:
We're under serious fire here.

38:13.024 --> 38:16.027
(panting)

38:16.061 --> 38:17.663
No, please, don't.

38:17.696 --> 38:20.065
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

38:20.098 --> 38:21.700
It's just you and me, baby girl.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.569
We're gonna see some stars
before we die.

38:23.602 --> 38:24.803
(officers shouting)

38:24.836 --> 38:26.372
(rapid gunfire)

38:30.442 --> 38:31.943
Any day now, Hondo.

38:31.977 --> 38:32.711
HONDO:
I'm here!

38:35.046 --> 38:36.782
*

38:49.094 --> 38:51.863
Getting into position now.

38:55.467 --> 38:58.103
Deac, get him to show his face.

38:58.136 --> 39:00.105
Give me some cover,
but be careful of the girl.

39:14.453 --> 39:15.921
(both coughing)

39:21.092 --> 39:22.728
Suspect still has hostage.

39:22.761 --> 39:24.029
I have no clear shot.

39:26.898 --> 39:27.833
DEACON:
I also have no shot.

39:27.866 --> 39:28.834
Girl's in the way.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.872
MUMFORD: Hondo, tell me
you got something.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.045
(gunshot)

39:41.947 --> 39:43.081
OFFICER:
Suspect down.

39:43.114 --> 39:45.584
All teams, move in. All teams.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.523
(screams) Help me!

39:51.557 --> 39:54.025
Suspect down! Suspect down!
Give me a two! Give me a two!

39:54.059 --> 39:55.761
Left side clear!

39:55.794 --> 39:57.796
Right side's clear!

39:57.829 --> 39:59.998
All clear!
All clear!

40:05.604 --> 40:06.972
DEACON:
Hondo.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.674
Hostage is safe.

40:12.844 --> 40:15.146
Let's go home.

40:15.180 --> 40:16.782
*

40:32.498 --> 40:34.900
I give you that shot ten more
times, how many you make?

40:34.933 --> 40:36.067
Retiring, one for one.

40:37.703 --> 40:38.970
All right.

40:39.004 --> 40:40.739
Just got off the phone
with the mayor.

40:40.772 --> 40:43.809
She sends her thanks
and congratulations.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.210
Good job.

40:45.243 --> 40:47.012
Team effort.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.079
Absolutely.

40:52.250 --> 40:54.886
Hey.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.589
Like Buck always said,
"A notch on our belts

40:57.623 --> 40:59.791
is a notch the bad guys
don't have on theirs."

40:59.825 --> 41:01.159
But let's not go
patting ourselves

41:01.192 --> 41:02.661
on the backs too hard, huh?

41:02.694 --> 41:04.663
Tomorrow's another day.

41:04.696 --> 41:05.864
I'll see you then.

41:05.897 --> 41:08.233
(officer whoops)

41:08.266 --> 41:09.635
Hey, Street, one last thing.

41:11.269 --> 41:14.540
(laughs)

41:14.573 --> 41:16.542
Head on a swivel, old-timer.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.648
Big date tonight?
Yeah.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.215
Girl from the tour bus.

41:24.249 --> 41:27.586
Last night in town
before she goes back to Ohio.

41:27.619 --> 41:28.687
Cancel it.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.788
Cancel?
Yup.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.022
This is a sure thing.

41:31.056 --> 41:32.624
No, you're coming
with me instead.

41:32.658 --> 41:35.226
You think that you can
match her offer, I'm all ears.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.629
I'm gonna show you what a
real family dinner's like.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.130
My cousin owns
a food truck

41:39.164 --> 41:40.899
that puts the best fried
chicken tacos ever.

41:40.932 --> 41:42.801
My Aunt Helena and
Uncle Sarzo are coming,

41:42.834 --> 41:44.302
and I always bring
them lotto scratchers.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.304
But you... get to give
it to them tonight.

41:46.337 --> 41:49.174
We just have to act real
disappointed when they lose.

41:49.207 --> 41:50.942
Look, uh...
(clears throat)

41:50.976 --> 41:52.844
I don't think so, but thank you.

41:52.878 --> 41:54.746
Let's go.
Hondo's orders.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.715
They're all kind of
amazing, and I haven't even

41:56.748 --> 41:57.816
told you about
my niece yet.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.150
You'll see.
Come on.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.987
STREET:
I get a say in this?

42:11.730 --> 42:13.331
Do I need to call 911

42:13.364 --> 42:15.701
and tell them there's
an intruder in my house?

42:15.734 --> 42:17.002
JESSICA: You gave me
a key, remember?

42:21.640 --> 42:23.241
Gave up on you using it.

42:26.745 --> 42:28.847
Following the rules
and doing what's right

42:28.880 --> 42:30.782
isn't always the same thing.

42:30.816 --> 42:31.883
(chuckles softly)

42:31.917 --> 42:34.285
No, it's not.

42:34.319 --> 42:36.321
No one can ever
find out about us,

42:36.354 --> 42:38.089
especially Hicks.

42:38.123 --> 42:39.257
Roger that.

42:45.631 --> 42:47.565
*

43:00.712 --> 43:02.047
(sighs)

43:06.351 --> 43:08.153
(chuckles)

43:08.186 --> 43:11.122
HONDO: Are you ready
for all that? (laughs)
