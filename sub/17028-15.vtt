00:03.235 --> 00:05.615
Girls, prepare to be more obsolete

00:05.616 --> 00:07.184
than you already are.

00:07.185 --> 00:08.451
Which will be hard.

00:08.452 --> 00:11.354
You're one step above newspapers.

00:11.355 --> 00:13.523
Behold, the future!

00:13.524 --> 00:16.126
Oh, no. I'm still here in the future?

00:19.297 --> 00:22.699
Or, Han, your sister's here.

00:22.700 --> 00:26.570
Hello, mola, Konichiwa.

00:26.571 --> 00:28.438
I guess now's a good time to admit

00:28.439 --> 00:30.373
that I ate a bunch of
shrooms and I'm seeing

00:30.374 --> 00:33.109
a robot in a bowtie.

00:33.110 --> 00:36.046
This is a room service
robot that delivers food.

00:36.047 --> 00:37.881
My aunt's Holiday Inn went belly-up.

00:37.882 --> 00:40.283
I got this and one night stand.

00:40.284 --> 00:41.585
That's the only one night stand

00:41.586 --> 00:44.387
you're ever gonna get.

00:44.388 --> 00:46.156
Must be a different kind of room service

00:46.157 --> 00:49.426
than they have at
Tuggington's Hourly Motel.

00:49.427 --> 00:51.094
Where the first tug is free.

00:53.931 --> 00:55.599
R2, thank God.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.836
I thought I lost you when
we blew up the Death Star.

00:59.837 --> 01:02.272
Would you like a late check out?

01:02.273 --> 01:04.174
Sorry, toots. I checked out years ago.

01:04.175 --> 01:06.810
List diner specials.

01:06.811 --> 01:10.680
You have ordered four adult films.

01:10.681 --> 01:11.781
That's a lie.

01:11.782 --> 01:14.985
I've only ordered three.

01:14.986 --> 01:18.255
Shut down, robot.

01:18.256 --> 01:20.590
Hey! Hey!

01:20.591 --> 01:22.993
This is what happens when
you get a robot for free!

01:26.364 --> 01:27.931
R2, no!

01:27.932 --> 01:31.668
Yoda's our friend!

01:31.669 --> 01:33.603
Somebody help me!

01:33.604 --> 01:35.972
If that thing could show
cleavage and steal silver wear,

01:35.973 --> 01:38.475
I'd be out of a job.

01:42.280 --> 01:48.020
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

01:55.029 --> 01:57.463
I can't wait for our date either, Bobby.

01:57.464 --> 01:59.599
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.234
You hang up first.

02:01.235 --> 02:04.304
No, you hang up... Oh, he hung up.

02:04.305 --> 02:06.573
I'm liking this guy more and more.

02:06.574 --> 02:09.108
I know. Isn't Bobby the cutest?

02:09.109 --> 02:12.212
Not smoking Chinese
baby cute, but not bad.

02:12.213 --> 02:13.713
Max, I'm so excited.

02:13.714 --> 02:15.448
This is the first date I'll be going on

02:15.449 --> 02:18.985
since Julia Roberts could
still open a romantic comedy.

02:18.986 --> 02:21.009
I'm still pissed at them
for stealing my life story

02:21.010 --> 02:22.322
for "Pretty Woman."

02:22.323 --> 02:25.291
Jason Alexander's
character was totally me.

02:25.292 --> 02:27.060
For our date, he's thinking of taking me

02:27.061 --> 02:29.229
on an afternoon picnic in the park.

02:29.230 --> 02:33.399
The pretty one, where you crotch
punched that mime into a pond.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.023
You know the fact
that Bobby's taking you

02:35.024 --> 02:36.769
on a day date is a bad sign, right?

02:36.770 --> 02:38.504
It probably means he's married.

02:38.505 --> 02:40.974
Or worse, afraid of the dark.

02:40.975 --> 02:43.676
Actually, the day date was my idea.

02:43.677 --> 02:45.678
You know we're not married, right?

02:45.679 --> 02:47.780
That's not why I call you my old lady.

02:47.781 --> 02:49.244
It's cause you write thank you notes

02:49.245 --> 02:51.751
and use the word jeepers.

02:51.752 --> 02:54.153
Jeepers, Max!

02:54.154 --> 02:56.089
I just figured if I go out at night,

02:56.090 --> 02:57.790
you'll have to run the dessert bar alone

02:57.791 --> 02:59.525
and you've never done that before.

02:59.526 --> 03:02.295
I've also never flossed my back teeth.

03:02.296 --> 03:04.964
And they're fine when it's not windy.

03:04.965 --> 03:06.699
I got this.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.534
Hey, girls.

03:08.535 --> 03:11.137
I just thought I'd take a
walk and stretch my knees.

03:11.138 --> 03:14.173
Then I remembered I don't have any.

03:14.174 --> 03:18.278
Earl, I'm going on a
night date, like a person.

03:18.279 --> 03:21.814
Max will be running the dessert
bar and that'll be fine, right?

03:21.815 --> 03:25.518
Ooh, speaking of
disasters, that reminds me,

03:25.519 --> 03:27.654
I have to return "Risky
Business" to Blockbuster.

03:27.655 --> 03:29.489
When do they close?

03:29.490 --> 03:31.457
2009.

03:31.458 --> 03:34.527
So I still have time.

03:34.528 --> 03:36.729
Hey, guys, look. It's a groundhog.

03:36.730 --> 03:38.798
So it's gonna be an early spring.

03:38.799 --> 03:41.334
No. He saw his shadow this year.

03:41.335 --> 03:43.169
Know your facts.

03:43.170 --> 03:45.571
Earl, you're supposed
to be in the diner.

03:45.572 --> 03:48.207
I had to ask our shrimp
supplier to cover for you.

03:48.208 --> 03:50.910
I thought your mother
was our shrimp supplier.

03:50.911 --> 03:54.147
Han, I'm going on a
night date, like a person.

03:54.148 --> 03:57.417
Max'll be running the dessert
bar and that'll be fine, right?

03:57.418 --> 04:00.186
Sure, like when I had her
run the diner by herself.

04:00.187 --> 04:03.022
Which never happened
because I'm not a damn fool!

04:03.023 --> 04:04.357
Let's go, Earl.

04:04.358 --> 04:05.825
All right, fine.

04:05.826 --> 04:07.559
I left my knees there, anyway.

04:09.729 --> 04:12.598
Hey, I was, uh... I was
just in the neighborhood

04:12.599 --> 04:14.867
and thought I'd hop on
two subways and a Citi Bike

04:14.868 --> 04:15.902
and come say hi.

04:15.903 --> 04:17.437
A Citi Bike?

04:17.438 --> 04:20.339
Oh, this city gal is flattered.

04:20.341 --> 04:22.241
Jeepers.

04:22.242 --> 04:23.910
Isn't he the cutest?

04:23.911 --> 04:26.612
Oh, not dog running in his
sleep cute, but I'm all right.

04:26.613 --> 04:28.281
Bobby, I have some good news.

04:28.282 --> 04:29.985
I don't want you to
think I'm loose or fast

04:29.986 --> 04:33.219
or whatever the kids
say, but I am available

04:33.220 --> 04:35.355
for a night date, like a person.

04:35.356 --> 04:37.056
Hey, really? That's great.

04:37.057 --> 04:39.459
I usually save my day
dates for my grandma.

04:39.460 --> 04:40.960
She likes a noon dinner.

04:40.961 --> 04:43.463
- I like a noon...
- No.

04:43.464 --> 04:44.727
Since we're going out at night,

04:44.728 --> 04:46.532
I can cancel all the romantic errands

04:46.533 --> 04:47.716
we were gonna run to the bank

04:47.717 --> 04:49.369
and my dry cleaners.

04:49.370 --> 04:50.703
Now I can take you to a movie.

04:50.704 --> 04:52.327
There's this new
theater that has couches

04:52.328 --> 04:53.539
and waiter service.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.641
Wow. We work in a restaurant

04:55.642 --> 04:57.877
and we don't have waiter service.

04:57.878 --> 05:00.646
He has a bank and clean clothes?

05:00.647 --> 05:02.781
Caroline, don't screw this up.

05:06.085 --> 05:10.323
Paging Dr. Pringle, you're
needed in my stomach.

05:10.324 --> 05:12.959
Okay, pop quiz on
running the dessert bar.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.994
What do you do if a customer chokes?

05:14.995 --> 05:17.897
Look, if I have to cut a
hole in someone's throat,

05:17.898 --> 05:19.999
I'll cut a hole in someone's throat.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.269
Cutting a hole in people can't
be your answer for everything.

05:23.270 --> 05:25.438
Next one. What do you
do if there's a fire?

05:25.439 --> 05:29.609
Follow up question: did I
or did I not start said fire?

05:29.610 --> 05:31.477
Either way, I'm cutting
a hole in someone.

05:31.478 --> 05:33.646
Okay you failed this quiz now twice.

05:33.647 --> 05:36.115
Especially the essay portion.

05:36.116 --> 05:38.116
I'm calling Bobby and canceling.

05:40.586 --> 05:43.489
Oh. They're home.

05:43.490 --> 05:46.025
He means, hey, girls.

05:46.026 --> 05:48.461
How did you get a key to our apartment?

05:48.462 --> 05:50.430
They specifically say on them,

05:50.431 --> 05:53.299
"Do not copy for Oleg."

05:53.300 --> 05:56.135
I find that when you go
in a Home Depot pantless,

05:56.136 --> 05:58.604
they'll do anything
to get you out quick.

05:58.605 --> 06:00.173
We come down here on our date nights

06:00.174 --> 06:02.308
to pretend we're two destitute girls

06:02.309 --> 06:04.510
who are sleeping together for warmth.

06:04.511 --> 06:06.779
Why do you guys come here?

06:06.780 --> 06:10.950
Why don't you go to, like,
I don't know, Olive Garden?

06:10.951 --> 06:12.985
Yeah, this is date night.

06:12.986 --> 06:17.190
Not find an overweight
guy to film us night.

06:17.191 --> 06:19.392
Staying in is a tradition.

06:19.393 --> 06:22.495
You know, in Poland, you
really can't go outside

06:22.496 --> 06:25.231
because of all the wild dogs.

06:25.232 --> 06:26.866
And if it wasn't for the wolves,

06:26.867 --> 06:29.335
You wouldn't be able to walk anywhere.

06:29.336 --> 06:32.305
Of course, you still
need your vulture stick.

06:32.306 --> 06:34.707
Speaking of vultures
circling a dead body,

06:34.708 --> 06:36.509
Caroline's got a date tonight.

06:38.579 --> 06:40.847
Oh, my God, Max. That's a good one.

06:40.848 --> 06:42.482
Say it again.

06:42.483 --> 06:43.749
No, it's not a joke.

06:43.750 --> 06:44.884
I'm really going on a date.

06:46.920 --> 06:50.223
Stop it! Oh, my gosh, I'm gonna pee.

06:50.224 --> 06:52.658
I'm going to that new
movie theater with couches.

06:52.659 --> 06:55.027
It's like watching at home,
but there isn't a giant spring

06:55.028 --> 06:56.395
poking you in the butt.

06:56.396 --> 06:58.096
Play your cards right, there will be.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:07.199 --> 07:08.767
Here you go. Two Liquor Doodles.

07:08.768 --> 07:10.436
And speaking of licking her doodle...

07:10.437 --> 07:13.605
No.

07:13.606 --> 07:15.753
What are you doing here?
I thought I left you

07:15.754 --> 07:16.475
at the apartment.

07:16.476 --> 07:18.349
Which is what my abductor said

07:18.350 --> 07:21.052
when I ran into him at Baskin-Robbins.

07:21.053 --> 07:23.821
Wait, did he work there or
did you just want ice cream?

07:23.822 --> 07:25.856
Because if he worked
there, why would you go...

07:25.857 --> 07:28.793
Anyway, I'm having Bobby pick me up here

07:28.794 --> 07:30.962
so I can keep my hand
on the fire extinguisher

07:30.963 --> 07:35.199
until we get to our wherever
it is he's taking me.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.802
No. You don't trust me.

07:37.803 --> 07:39.737
You think I'm gonna mess this place up.

07:39.738 --> 07:41.572
Ah, Caroline gone yet?

07:41.573 --> 07:46.143
'Cause I got us some high-grade pot...

07:46.144 --> 07:50.681
to turn into the
authorities immediately.

07:50.682 --> 07:54.385
Earl, you go AWOL more
often than Mischa Barton

07:54.386 --> 07:55.920
on a movie set.

07:55.921 --> 07:58.356
What do I have to do to
keep you in that diner?

07:58.357 --> 08:01.325
Well a date with Halle
Berry would be nice.

08:01.326 --> 08:04.562
I also wouldn't hate minimum wage.

08:04.563 --> 08:06.697
How about a butterscotch pudding?

08:06.698 --> 08:08.499
That works, too.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.901
That pudding has saved me
thousands over the years.

08:10.902 --> 08:14.505
And who told him about minimum wage?

08:14.506 --> 08:17.942
Will you just go on your date already?

08:17.943 --> 08:20.711
- Ashley!
- Ashleigh!

08:22.381 --> 08:24.749
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

08:24.750 --> 08:27.885
Oh, my God. Sorority sisters?

08:27.886 --> 08:29.453
Max, you hate them.

08:29.454 --> 08:32.188
I mean, I was a sorority sister.

08:32.190 --> 08:34.125
You look so good!

08:34.126 --> 08:36.027
Shut up, I gained, like, two pounds.

08:36.028 --> 08:38.761
Oh, you shut up. You
look like you're dying.

08:40.464 --> 08:43.534
Just relax, I'll take care of them.

08:43.534 --> 08:45.198
And I don't mean
calling my friend Dmitri,

08:45.199 --> 08:47.571
who has his own dumpster.

08:47.572 --> 08:49.307
Oh, sorority sisters, huh?

08:49.308 --> 08:51.542
Epsilon Phis! And we
haven't seen each other

08:51.543 --> 08:52.743
in, like, three days.

08:52.744 --> 08:55.112
Uh, that's pretty obvious.

08:55.113 --> 08:58.115
Let me get you some menus.

08:58.116 --> 09:01.285
Eh? Nobody got hurt.

09:01.286 --> 09:04.421
I'd feel better if your eye
wasn't twitching like that.

09:06.590 --> 09:09.727
Wow, Caroline, you look beautiful.

09:09.728 --> 09:12.730
Speaking of beautiful, who
built this awesome place?

09:12.731 --> 09:15.099
This guy. I'm going
out with him tonight.

09:15.100 --> 09:17.168
He's cute, too.

09:17.169 --> 09:20.471
Okay, I know you're talking
about me, but I get jealous.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.807
I'm gonna tell you what
I always told my mom:

09:22.808 --> 09:24.809
go out, get plastered
and you don't have to wait

09:24.810 --> 09:26.777
till the morning after to take the pill.

09:26.778 --> 09:29.747
That's just a name.

09:29.748 --> 09:31.481
It's okay, I took mine on the way over.

09:33.150 --> 09:36.386
Have fun Max. Do not have fun. Bye!

09:38.823 --> 09:43.361
I can handle a few sorority girls.

09:43.362 --> 09:45.862
Let me make sure I still
have Dmitri's number.

09:47.198 --> 09:48.966
Bunny!

09:48.967 --> 09:52.670
Ashley! Ashleigh!

09:52.671 --> 09:55.639
God, they're multiplying.

09:55.640 --> 09:57.608
Oh, you look so good!

09:57.609 --> 09:59.977
- Oh, shut up.
- You shut up!

09:59.978 --> 10:03.179
You guys should really
listen to each other.

10:05.649 --> 10:08.319
Couches in movie theaters?

10:08.320 --> 10:12.022
I feel like Kate Middleton right now.

10:12.023 --> 10:13.891
I'm glad you're easily impressed.

10:13.892 --> 10:16.994
For Valentine's Day, I'll take
you to the Super Target cafe.

10:16.995 --> 10:19.463
Well I can't just sit
on that kinda news.

10:19.464 --> 10:21.065
Let me just call Max and tell her.

10:21.066 --> 10:24.535
Nope, straight to her
outgoing fart message.

10:24.536 --> 10:27.338
Bon soir, everybody. My name is Marcel,

10:27.339 --> 10:29.407
and I will be the
curator for this evening's

10:29.408 --> 10:31.675
cinematic experience.

10:31.676 --> 10:34.044
The film, which Owen
Gleiberman has hailed,

10:34.045 --> 10:36.013
a Kubrickesque tour de force,

10:36.014 --> 10:37.848
will be screening in DCP...

10:37.849 --> 10:41.218
Uh, yes? A question
from a fellow cinephile?

10:41.219 --> 10:43.053
Do I have to order the seasoned fries

10:43.054 --> 10:47.925
separate from the regular ones
or can I just get them mixed?

10:47.926 --> 10:49.927
It's a dollar extra.

10:49.928 --> 10:53.564
I'll be taking orders
once the movie starts.

10:53.565 --> 10:54.964
Whatever.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.935
Hey, great question about the fries.

10:57.936 --> 11:00.871
I had a follow up about free refills.

11:00.872 --> 11:02.706
Everything okay?

11:02.707 --> 11:05.342
I was just, um, checking
this place on Yelp.

11:05.343 --> 11:07.378
And to see if the dessert
bar was on the news.

11:07.379 --> 11:08.912
Or engulfed in flames.

11:10.080 --> 11:13.918
Shh.

11:13.919 --> 11:16.353
You saw the dancing hot dog.

11:16.354 --> 11:18.389
No cell phones.

11:18.390 --> 11:20.124
What are you guys doing here?

11:20.125 --> 11:23.694
Did I cover my bed in
"Dexter" tarp for nothing?

11:23.695 --> 11:24.929
We're on a date.

11:24.930 --> 11:27.798
Trying like crazy not to have sex.

11:27.799 --> 11:30.134
Usually, when the lights
go down in the movie,

11:30.135 --> 11:31.969
so do my pants.

11:31.970 --> 11:34.972
And then, so do I.

11:34.973 --> 11:38.776
And of course we would have
to see a super sexy poster

11:38.777 --> 11:42.279
of Steve Buscemi in the lobby.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.582
Hi, I'm Bobby. Nice to meet you.

11:44.583 --> 11:47.952
Sorry, I'm no Steve Buscemi.
I had braces in high school.

11:47.953 --> 11:51.055
You guys brought Barbara
on your date with you?

11:51.056 --> 11:54.124
Of course not. She's
with the babysitter.

11:54.125 --> 11:57.661
We used the carriage
to sneak in our dinner.

11:57.662 --> 12:01.398
Hey, we're not gonna
pay movie chicken prices.

12:01.399 --> 12:03.433
Oleg, tear me off a leg.

12:09.673 --> 12:11.874
Good. Yeah.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.680
Was that a siren?

12:16.681 --> 12:17.982
Oh, it's coming from the screen.

12:17.983 --> 12:19.650
The movie's called "Sirens."

12:19.651 --> 12:21.685
I know, but I thought I
heard another one under it

12:21.686 --> 12:24.955
that sounded like it could
be heading for a dessert bar.

12:24.956 --> 12:26.624
Are you not having a good time?

12:26.625 --> 12:27.925
Do you not like movies?

12:27.926 --> 12:29.860
Please tell me you don't like plays.

12:29.861 --> 12:32.129
No, I'm having a great time.

12:32.130 --> 12:36.133
And please tell me you don't
consider musicals plays.

12:36.134 --> 12:38.435
Hey, I don't wanna check in on Max

12:38.436 --> 12:39.979
'cause she'll think I don't trust her.

12:39.980 --> 12:41.438
So can you check in on Max?

12:41.439 --> 12:44.208
Because I really don't trust her.

12:44.209 --> 12:47.177
Uh, I got chicken hands!

12:47.178 --> 12:49.947
Why don't you ask your
boyfriend to do it?

12:49.948 --> 12:52.383
First, we haven't discussed labels yet.

12:52.384 --> 12:55.452
And second, I don't want him
to think I'm not having fun.

12:55.453 --> 12:58.188
I'm having so much fun.

12:58.189 --> 13:01.725
I would go to a musical
if it was important to you

13:01.726 --> 13:03.226
I'll do it.

13:04.895 --> 13:06.830
Texting? Out.

13:06.831 --> 13:09.233
And don't come back until
you gain some respect

13:09.234 --> 13:11.168
for the art form.

13:11.169 --> 13:15.372
Who ordered the chili dog
with the nachos on top?

13:15.373 --> 13:20.311
Well it probably all for the best.

13:20.312 --> 13:21.979
Since you're leaving anyways,

13:21.980 --> 13:23.981
you can check in on Max in person.

13:23.982 --> 13:25.516
I guess.

13:25.517 --> 13:28.451
Since we're about to
chicken up your bed.

13:38.909 --> 13:40.776
Epsilon Phi until we die!

13:40.777 --> 13:42.811
Epsilon Phi until we die!

13:42.812 --> 13:44.970
Ah, heard you the first
time. I'm working on it.

13:52.422 --> 13:54.189
Aw, come on, Ashley!

13:54.190 --> 13:57.159
That's something I'd
expect from Ashleigh.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.228
Can you do something?

13:59.229 --> 14:01.297
Uh, uhh.

14:01.298 --> 14:05.167
Hey you, uh, they're trying to
let a poor girl in the sorority.

14:05.168 --> 14:08.170
Who? Is she ugly?

14:08.171 --> 14:10.506
There you go. See? She's as annoying

14:10.507 --> 14:13.642
as she was five minutes ago.

14:13.643 --> 14:14.910
Now what do you people want?

14:14.911 --> 14:17.012
Um, more shots.

14:17.013 --> 14:21.417
Also, Ashleigh threw
up in Ashley's purse.

14:21.418 --> 14:24.954
Ah, back from the liquor store.

14:24.955 --> 14:26.989
Sorry I took so long.

14:26.990 --> 14:31.994
I didn't realize I
was at a Pottery Barn.

14:31.995 --> 14:34.330
Well, while I've got you confused,

14:34.331 --> 14:35.554
How about you get back to work

14:35.555 --> 14:36.966
and bring out these drinks for me?

14:36.967 --> 14:38.634
I am not confused. I realized

14:38.635 --> 14:43.339
I'm a waitress at this TGIFridays.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.873
Congratulate us!

14:44.874 --> 14:47.910
We've just gone two
hours without having sex.

14:47.911 --> 14:52.314
Which breaks our old record
by pretty close to two hours.

14:52.315 --> 14:54.183
You know, Caroline asked
us to check up on you

14:54.184 --> 14:56.318
because she was worried.

14:56.319 --> 14:58.554
We're not supposed to tell you that.

14:58.555 --> 15:00.689
But I had to leave a
half a roasted chicken

15:00.690 --> 15:02.491
in the movie theater.

15:02.492 --> 15:05.060
So I am!

15:05.061 --> 15:07.196
Does she have any idea what
I've been through tonight

15:07.197 --> 15:08.764
with these sorority girls?

15:08.765 --> 15:10.598
For all she knows, I'm sober.

15:13.002 --> 15:14.603
Sorority girls, huh?

15:14.604 --> 15:16.905
I was in a sorority once.

15:16.906 --> 15:18.272
Until they found me.

15:20.576 --> 15:22.011
What's going on? We've been waiting

15:22.012 --> 15:24.413
for our next round of
drinks for, like, ever.

15:24.414 --> 15:27.249
Wow, Max.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.852
Are you really gonna let
the cast of "Pitch Perfect"

15:29.853 --> 15:32.755
talk to you like that?

15:32.756 --> 15:34.657
People in charge don't
punch sorority girls.

15:34.658 --> 15:37.059
People in charge don't
punch sorority girls.

15:37.060 --> 15:38.894
And can we get separate checks?

15:38.895 --> 15:40.963
Or do they?

15:40.964 --> 15:42.665
Separate checks?

15:42.666 --> 15:44.967
Do I look like a mathologist to you?

15:44.968 --> 15:46.602
Is that a problem? 'Cause I'd hate to

15:46.603 --> 15:48.704
have to say something on Yelp.

15:48.705 --> 15:53.042
Yelp? Caroline checks that
more than she Googles herself.

15:53.043 --> 15:54.610
Uh, not a problem at all.

15:54.611 --> 15:57.179
Drinks and separate checks...

15:57.180 --> 15:59.348
whatever that is... coming right up!

15:59.349 --> 16:01.517
Thanks! You're the cutest.

16:01.518 --> 16:05.487
No, you are.

16:05.488 --> 16:07.322
Looks like someone's in the weeds

16:07.323 --> 16:09.658
and not just smoking it for a change.

16:09.659 --> 16:12.961
Don't just kneel there,
bring these drinks out.

16:12.962 --> 16:14.930
I have to learn all
of math in ten minutes.

16:14.931 --> 16:16.565
All right, I'll stay.

16:16.566 --> 16:18.407
But only because I want
you to see how it feels

16:18.408 --> 16:19.471
when the shoe is on the...

16:19.472 --> 16:20.869
Serve the damn drinks!

16:20.870 --> 16:23.939
She gets it.

16:23.940 --> 16:26.741
How long you been working
at this Fridays, sonny?

16:32.748 --> 16:34.450
Uh, is everything all right?

16:34.451 --> 16:36.752
You've been to the bathroom nine times.

16:36.753 --> 16:38.120
Are you a drug addict?

16:38.121 --> 16:39.488
"Candy Crush" junkie?

16:39.489 --> 16:41.757
We can deal with it together.

16:41.758 --> 16:46.161
I'm sorry, Bobby, but you
know how turtles can sense

16:46.162 --> 16:49.198
if their turtle best
friend is stuck upside down

16:49.199 --> 16:53.402
on its shell, its turtle
legs all wiggling in the air?

16:53.403 --> 16:55.604
So it is drugs.

16:55.605 --> 16:57.372
Good. "Candy Crush" is tough.

16:57.373 --> 16:58.774
We went through that with my mom.

16:58.775 --> 17:00.943
It's a killer. We almost lost our house.

17:00.944 --> 17:03.312
No, Max and I are the turtles.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.814
And I can feel she's trapped
on her back at the dessert bar.

17:05.815 --> 17:08.550
All right, look, I
don't know Max that well.

17:08.550 --> 17:10.352
But I've gotten to know you a little bit

17:10.353 --> 17:12.354
and you have a really good,

17:12.355 --> 17:15.656
really beautiful head on your shoulders.

17:15.657 --> 17:19.261
You trusted Max. You should
trust your own instincts.

17:19.262 --> 17:23.132
You're right. I do
have a nice shaped head.

17:23.133 --> 17:24.900
And I'm gonna stop
worrying that she might

17:24.901 --> 17:26.902
- burn the bar down.
- Good. What?

17:26.903 --> 17:28.804
Seriously? I put a ton
of work into that place.

17:30.707 --> 17:32.741
You know what? This movie sucks.

17:32.742 --> 17:34.843
Let's get out of here
and go get some dessert.

17:34.844 --> 17:37.479
I know a great place.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.314
That is so sweet.

17:39.315 --> 17:41.617
And I was so worried
you'd think I was crazy.

17:41.618 --> 17:43.719
Oh, you're bananas.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.053
But I like bananas.

17:45.054 --> 17:46.722
Not the fruit. The
texture grosses me out.

17:46.723 --> 17:49.992
But you.

17:49.993 --> 17:51.994
I could kiss you for that.

17:51.995 --> 17:53.228
You know, you actually could.

17:53.229 --> 17:54.795
You're right, I can.

18:02.171 --> 18:03.551
Yeah, we should get out of here.

18:12.748 --> 18:16.151
Hello? It's taking longer than
it took me to almost graduate.

18:16.152 --> 18:18.086
Just hang onto your hair extensions.

18:19.556 --> 18:20.755
They're obvious?

18:23.559 --> 18:25.360
My turtle sense was right.

18:25.361 --> 18:29.665
Max is on her back and
she's not under a boy turtle.

18:29.666 --> 18:31.834
Maybe she's all right.
I don't smell fire

18:31.835 --> 18:34.570
and everyone's shoulders
are still in their sockets.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.338
Why are separate checks taking so long?

18:36.339 --> 18:38.073
Can we please get our change?

18:38.074 --> 18:40.008
Um, you put the apps
on Bunny's bill, right?

18:40.009 --> 18:41.977
'Cause she ate the most, as per ush.

18:41.978 --> 18:43.846
Stop telling people I eat!

18:43.847 --> 18:45.681
Stop telling people my LSAT scores.

18:45.682 --> 18:47.950
Stop talking! Now I have to start over.

18:47.951 --> 18:51.086
I have a lot of numbers in
my head and they're all angry.

18:51.087 --> 18:53.055
I have to help her. Separate checks?

18:53.056 --> 18:56.692
Max calls 13 "ten three."

18:56.693 --> 18:59.194
Caroline, wait. Let her try
and handle this on her own.

18:59.195 --> 19:01.338
Otherwise, we'll never be
able to go on a second date.

19:01.339 --> 19:02.965
But she really nee...

19:02.966 --> 19:05.767
There's gonna be a second date?

19:05.768 --> 19:08.437
Okay, listen up, everybody!

19:08.438 --> 19:10.405
Calm down!

19:10.406 --> 19:13.141
Here's what we're gonna do
instead of separate checks:

19:13.142 --> 19:14.977
I'm not good at math, but I have been

19:14.978 --> 19:18.046
a negotiations expert
for ten three years.

19:18.047 --> 19:20.983
Ashley, you're gonna get $6
from Bunny's PayPal account

19:20.984 --> 19:22.484
and she's gonna do your nails.

19:22.485 --> 19:24.519
Bunny, you're gonna Venmo Amber $20

19:24.520 --> 19:26.503
And she's gonna let you
borrow her gay friend Dave

19:26.504 --> 19:28.857
for your sister's wed. Everybody good?

19:28.858 --> 19:32.728
You've got ten three minutes to decide.

19:32.729 --> 19:33.629
We're good.

19:33.630 --> 19:37.966
Okay, problem solved.

19:37.967 --> 19:39.534
Max, that was amazing.

19:39.535 --> 19:41.270
I knew you could do that on your own.

19:41.271 --> 19:43.238
No you didn't, you were spying on me.

19:43.239 --> 19:46.341
Her turtle sense went off.

19:46.342 --> 19:49.678
Is it strange that I'm a little
sad that you don't need me?

19:49.679 --> 19:53.982
I didn't say I don't need
you, but you are a little sad.

19:53.983 --> 19:58.153
Earl, it was a pleasure
waiting tables at your side.

19:58.154 --> 20:03.525
You and I have a chemistry
you can't make in a lab.

20:03.526 --> 20:07.862
You have a real strange
way of talking to dudes.

20:10.532 --> 20:12.134
Uh, hi.

20:12.135 --> 20:13.878
Did you guys know there
are two naked people

20:13.879 --> 20:15.604
eating chicken off each other in there?

20:15.605 --> 20:19.541
What? I haven't
chicken-proofed those sinks.

20:19.542 --> 20:22.877
All right, I'm closing my
eyes and then I'm coming in.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.549
Isn't he brave?

20:27.550 --> 20:31.253
So did he bravely go where
no man has gone before?

20:31.254 --> 20:33.422
Under your sweater?

20:33.423 --> 20:35.857
No, but we were smooching in the movie.

20:35.858 --> 20:37.225
Shut up!

20:37.226 --> 20:38.627
- No, you shut up.
- No, really,

20:38.628 --> 20:40.168
shut your damn mouth, I'm exhausted.
