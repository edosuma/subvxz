20:08.374 --> 20:10.167
I mean,
I can't keep living this way.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.627
[ Sighs ]
I need answers.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.671
You know, I just don't know
where to look.

20:13.671 --> 20:16.841
Maybe something
closer to your nature.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.259
Uh, how about voodoo?

20:18.259 --> 20:20.052
No.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.721
I tried that
on a bunch of boyfriends.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.556
That doesn't work.

20:23.556 --> 20:27.476
I stuck a pin
in Doug Jensen's doll junk.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.395
He still had eight kids.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.607
You'll find something
that'll work for you.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.152
I know I will.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.404
You're gonna go look
right now?

20:38.404 --> 20:39.905
Oh, no.

20:39.905 --> 20:43.242
I'm gonna go back to that church
and clean out the donation bin,

20:43.242 --> 20:44.952
'cause Mom would want it
that way.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.121
[ Both chuckle ]

20:50.166 --> 20:52.543
I just don't want to come off
as uncool and dumb.

20:52.543 --> 20:54.503
I feel that way too in
my new school, but it's online.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.714
You can hide and just listen
and take notes.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.924
You know, we'll log
you in, and we won't
turn on your camera.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.010
You're right.

21:01.010 --> 21:04.555
I can just ease my way in.

21:04.555 --> 21:07.391
Let's do this.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.059
Becky's here!

21:10.978 --> 21:12.730
Uh, hi.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.399
I have a joke.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.401
A statistician
tried to cross a river

21:17.401 --> 21:19.570
that was one meter deep
on average.

21:19.570 --> 21:23.115
And he drowned.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.492
Ding‐dong.
