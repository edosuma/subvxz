00:00.100 --> 00:03.796
Tao says not to worry.
The bodies aren't going anywhere.

00:03.904 --> 00:07.000
That's good, 'cause your shortcut
isn't working out too well.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.070
Oh, my… seriously, you're
gonna tell me how to drive?

00:10.110 --> 00:11.270
Del

00:10.757 --> 00:13.555
–You can't even see.
–Was that our turn?

00:14.161 --> 00:16.925
–Ok. I can't take this anymore.
–What?

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:33.447 --> 00:37.645
This is L. A.
The sun shines 329 days a year.

00:38.151 --> 00:40.395
That squint is not working for me.

00:51.398 --> 00:53.764
This was completely unnecessary.

00:54.534 --> 00:56.058
You're welcome.

01:05.279 --> 01:07.007
We're gonna need to get
all of your phone numbers

01:07.047 --> 01:08.475
in case we have any more questions.

01:08.515 --> 01:09.710
Do you want our home or cell?

01:09.750 --> 01:12.654
Both, please, and e-mail
as well. Thank you.

01:24.564 --> 01:29.467
–Who's our bleeders?
–Razi Moktari, 45, lives in Chatsworth.

01:30.237 --> 01:33.567
Runs a shipping business in long beach.
He's Iranian.

01:33.607 --> 01:36.236
The other guy is Jeffrey
Sanders, his driver.

01:36.276 --> 01:39.074
His wife is Layla Moktari.

01:39.513 --> 01:42.476
She's sitting over there
in the black-and-white.

01:42.516 --> 01:45.679
–Did she see what happened?
–Well, she didn't speak to me.

01:45.719 --> 01:49.217
–Guess I'm not her type.
–She'd only talk to a woman.

01:49.523 --> 01:52.886
Mrs Moktari says they were
leaving her doctor's appointment.

01:52.926 --> 01:56.690
just as she was getting in the
car, a dark S. U. V. drives by,

01:56.730 --> 01:58.825
guy leans out the window with a gun

01:58.865 --> 02:01.561
unloads on the husband first
and then the driver.

02:01.601 --> 02:02.929
Did she get a good look at him?

02:02.969 --> 02:05.899
Not really, but she did
say the shooter was white.

02:05.939 --> 02:08.634
She's also been saying the
U. S. government was behind this.

02:08.675 --> 02:11.972
–Do you want to talk to her?
–No, no. Let her pull herself together.

02:12.012 --> 02:13.741
Now where was our shooter?

02:13.814 --> 02:18.376
According to witnesses, the
S. U. V. stopped right about here.

02:18.685 --> 02:20.778
Not much margin for error.

02:21.188 --> 02:24.555
Moktari was probably dead
before he hit the cement,

02:24.725 --> 02:26.522
as was the driver.

02:26.593 --> 02:29.027
Driver… slash…

02:31.465 --> 02:32.557
Bodyguard.

02:32.632 --> 02:35.896
–Did the bodyguard fire any shots?
–No evidence found yet.

02:35.936 --> 02:39.896
–So these are all from our shooter.
–11 of them. 40 caliber.

02:39.973 --> 02:42.237
Smells like a professional hit.

02:42.309 --> 02:45.505
–And what about the other witnesses?
–There's Jesse, the parking lot attendant.

02:45.545 --> 02:48.375
Dr Chilton, ears, nose,
and throat specialist,

02:48.415 --> 02:50.444
he was one level up with a young nurse.

02:50.484 --> 02:52.612
They heard the shots, but
they didn't see anything.

02:52.652 --> 02:55.215
Then there's Dr Graham,
the pulmonary guy.

02:55.255 --> 02:59.119
He dropped to the ground when he heard
the shots and then rushed over to help…

02:59.159 --> 03:01.244
after he saw the S. U. V. drive off.

03:01.284 --> 03:02.284
All right.

03:02.288 --> 03:04.962
Secure this
parking structure, please.

03:05.031 --> 03:07.594
Nobody touches or takes
anything out of their car

03:07.634 --> 03:10.530
and no vehicles go in or out
until I say so. Thank you.

03:10.570 --> 03:12.499
–Yes, ma'am.
–Detectives Sanchez and Daniels,

03:12.539 --> 03:15.068
if you could do a follow-up
canvass on the neighborhood, please.

03:15.108 --> 03:16.903
See if anyone saw that S. U. V. leave.

03:16.943 --> 03:20.974
Lieutenant Provenza and sergeant Gabriel,
if you could check the security tape,

03:21.014 --> 03:24.444
see if we have any pictures
of that car going in or out.

03:24.484 --> 03:26.145
Detective Tao, follow up on ballistics.

03:26.185 --> 03:27.901
And who are you gentlemen?

03:27.954 --> 03:31.014
Agent Jackson, FBI.
Don't let us interrupt.

03:31.091 --> 03:33.321
Excuse me, sir. Why are you here?

03:33.393 --> 03:35.322
Do you have information
about these murders?

03:35.362 --> 03:37.728
Nope. You guys just do your thing.

03:37.798 --> 03:40.227
Well, part of my thing is
securing this crime scene.

03:40.267 --> 03:43.463
–So if you wouldn't mind…
–We're not gonna get in anybody's way.

03:43.503 --> 03:44.527
Trust me.

03:44.604 --> 03:48.630
I stopped believing boys who
said, “trust me,” when I was 16.

03:50.110 --> 03:53.373
Lieutenant Provenza, would you
mind escorting agent Jackson

03:53.413 --> 03:55.142
and his friend here out of the area?

03:55.182 --> 03:56.910
–Thank you very much.
–My pleasure, ma'am.

03:56.950 --> 03:58.508
Gents…

03:58.585 --> 04:01.349
Hey, just take it easy, all right, bro?

04:01.555 --> 04:05.753
–I'm not your bro.
–The lady said she wants you out of here.

04:05.826 --> 04:08.488
I don't take orders from L. A. P. D

04:09.162 --> 04:11.558
Hey, come on, now! What
the hell's that all about?

04:11.598 --> 04:14.928
–Lieutenant, are you all right?
–I don't know. I think I broke something!

04:14.968 --> 04:18.832
I am shocked that you would assault
an old man without provocation.

04:18.872 --> 04:21.034
–Assault? Give me a break, will you, lady?
–I'll give you one more chance…

04:21.074 --> 04:22.751
to leave the area, agent Jackson.

04:22.791 --> 04:23.937
This is crazy, and you know it.

04:23.977 --> 04:25.939
All we're trying to do
is find out what happened.

04:25.979 --> 04:28.375
Detective Daniels, would you please
stow and impound his car?

04:28.415 --> 04:31.211
Sergeant Gabriel, check
and see if a paramedic

04:31.251 --> 04:33.547
can come down here and take a look
at lieutenant Provenza. Are you ok?

04:33.587 --> 04:36.579
–Old man?
–All right.

04:36.957 --> 04:41.656
–You made your point, officer.
–Deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.

04:44.998 --> 04:46.829
Go on, now. Go on.

04:49.269 --> 04:51.601
Bye now. Bye-bye.

04:55.008 --> 04:59.308
What do you know?
I feel better already.

05:04.251 --> 05:07.550
–Chief Pope, I need a word.
–E-mail it to me.

05:07.621 --> 05:08.815
It's important.

05:08.889 --> 05:11.051
The FBI is threatening to pull resources

05:11.091 --> 05:13.292
on 6 of our joint investigations.

05:13.360 --> 05:17.757
When my guys wanted to know why,
they were told to ask Brenda Johnson.

05:17.797 --> 05:18.821
Right.

05:18.899 --> 05:22.762
Now, I know it's called Priority Homicide,
but are you really going to allow her…

05:22.802 --> 05:25.253
to kill 6 cases over this murder,

05:25.254 --> 05:27.705
including a 2-year gang sting?

05:35.649 --> 05:38.778
Deputy chief Johnson,
you remember special agent Jackson.

05:38.818 --> 05:41.815
Of course. Did you drop
by to make a formal apology

05:41.855 --> 05:43.249
for assaulting lieutenant Provenza?

05:43.289 --> 05:44.741
He assaulted Provenza?

05:44.791 --> 05:48.158
–The old guy took a dive.
–He hurt his wrist badly.

05:48.695 --> 05:52.259
Well, we all know the FBI
likes to push people around,

05:52.265 --> 05:57.347
but I really don't want a turf war here,
so let's see what we can figure out.

05:57.404 --> 05:58.530
Fine.

05:58.905 --> 06:02.235
Agent Jackson hasn't said
what his interest in this case is.

06:02.275 --> 06:05.805
Do you have possess information linking
these murders to a federal employee

06:05.845 --> 06:07.073
or RICO statutes?

06:07.147 --> 06:11.177
We have an Iranian businessman who
was gunned down assassination-style.

06:11.217 --> 06:12.345
You make the leap.

06:12.385 --> 06:15.282
We're not getting in the way
of a terrorism investigation.

06:15.322 --> 06:20.153
If that's what we're dealing with, lay
out the evidence, and we'll stand aside.

06:20.193 --> 06:21.985
Razi Moktari's on our watch list.

06:22.025 --> 06:23.856
So's Cat Stevens.

06:23.930 --> 06:26.927
We were thinking more along
the lines of actual proof.

06:26.967 --> 06:29.367
That we don't have… yet.

06:31.204 --> 06:33.166
Ok. Well, then, here's what we'll do.

06:33.206 --> 06:36.436
The FBI may observe and
advise deputy chief Johnson

06:36.476 --> 06:38.004
during our investigation,

06:38.044 --> 06:42.504
provided that you give her
a full briefing on this… Moktari guy.

06:42.582 --> 06:44.607
That may not be possible.

06:46.219 --> 06:49.983
Or I can hold a press conference this
afternoon demanding to know why…

06:50.023 --> 06:53.386
in the aftermath of 9/11,
the FBI is spending more time

06:53.426 --> 06:58.178
assaulting and harassing L. A. P. D
officers than cooperating with them.

07:00.700 --> 07:01.860
Ok.

07:02.902 --> 07:06.099
I'll recommend we assign
a liaison agent to your department…

07:06.139 --> 07:08.415
with the authority to tell Ms Johnson

07:08.455 --> 07:10.831
as much as national security allows.

07:10.844 --> 07:14.804
Fine. I look forward to working
with whomever you send over.

07:17.784 --> 07:19.779
Well, of course they're
taking this case.

07:19.819 --> 07:22.855
Standard FBI procedure,
waiting around for us…

07:22.889 --> 07:25.919
to do all the hard work,
and then they grab it and run.

07:25.959 --> 07:28.722
Yeah, but it's gotta be
either terrorism or drugs.

07:28.762 --> 07:30.059
Or both.

07:30.430 --> 07:34.394
A lot of the heroin coming into
Los Angeles is from Afghanistan.

07:34.434 --> 07:37.097
That's how Al Qaeda finances
most of their operations.

07:37.137 --> 07:39.733
Yeah, but Moktari's not
an arab. He's Iranian.

07:39.773 --> 07:41.423
Toe-may-toe,
toe-mah-toe.

07:41.474 --> 07:43.374
Well, then. Good news.

07:43.443 --> 07:46.840
We will be getting some extra help
from our friends over at the FBI.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.280
Oh, aren't we lucky?

07:52.619 --> 07:54.147
Well, then, let's move quickly,

07:54.187 --> 07:56.650
See if we can't find our
killer before they get here.

07:56.690 --> 07:59.420
First up, where is
our shooter's vehicle?

07:59.492 --> 08:01.054
It's not gonna be that easy.

08:01.094 --> 08:04.357
The security cameras in the garage
were shut down at the time of the crime,

08:04.397 --> 08:07.169
so we don't have a
picture of the vehicle.

08:08.635 --> 08:11.731
–Shut down how?
–Well, they're very ingenious, chief.

08:11.771 --> 08:13.261
They cut the wires.

08:13.339 --> 08:15.669
Whoever did this planned
it out pretty well.

08:15.709 --> 08:18.705
This guy Jeffrey Sanders, the
bodyguard, is the real deal.

08:18.745 --> 08:20.040
10 years in the marines…

08:20.080 --> 08:22.308
and then 5 years with pinnacle
protection services.

08:22.348 --> 08:23.878
Did we find any more witnesses?

08:23.918 --> 08:26.162
Yeah, once the story hit the news.

08:26.219 --> 08:29.347
40 people saw a very
suspicious, dark S. U. V.

08:30.356 --> 08:32.519
Lieutenant Tao, what do we
know about the murder weapon?

08:32.558 --> 08:37.023
The markings on the slugs from the rifle
barreling are consistent with a Sig Sauer.

08:37.063 --> 08:38.758
Run the casings through the system,

08:38.798 --> 08:41.861
see if our murder weapon's
been used in any other crime.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.964
Detective Daniels, as our official
liaison to Homeland Security,

08:45.004 --> 08:47.534
could you find out what
they know about Mr Moktari?

08:47.574 --> 08:50.070
Detective Sanchez, if you could
do the same with the gang unit.

08:50.110 --> 08:53.306
Lieutenant Provenza, find out if
the shooting matches anyone's MO.

08:53.346 --> 08:55.942
Oh, and I told the FBI
that you hurt your wrist,

08:55.982 --> 08:58.712
so have that bandaged
up before they get here.

08:58.752 --> 09:02.916
And sergeant Gabriel, please,
please, please find me that S. U. V.

09:02.956 --> 09:04.218
Yes, ma'am.

09:04.524 --> 09:08.483
–So Fritzie, who is this jerk, anyway?
–Jackson?

09:08.762 --> 09:11.958
He's an ok guy.
He's under a lot of pressure these days.

09:11.998 --> 09:13.260
And I'm not?

09:13.333 --> 09:16.029
I haven't even been able to
call my mother back in 2 weeks.

09:16.069 --> 09:19.633
–She's threatening to visit.
–So how's the case going?

09:19.639 --> 09:22.699
Oh, I can't find anything
on this Moktari guy.

09:22.776 --> 09:27.406
His bank statements, DMV. records,
work visas… everything's frozen.

09:28.081 --> 09:30.015
Yeah. Yeah, we do that.

09:30.083 --> 09:32.679
But don't worry. You'll
find out soon enough.

09:32.719 --> 09:36.849
Yeah, right. You're sending
me some liaison officer.

09:37.223 --> 09:40.954
Now I have to deal with some
some pompous, arrogant oaf…

09:41.027 --> 09:44.524
who doesn't know thing one
about investigating a murder.

09:44.564 --> 09:47.093
You wouldn't happen to know who
they're sending over, would you?

09:47.133 --> 09:48.157
Yeah.

09:49.669 --> 09:50.829
I do.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.686
Look, I know L. A. P. D and the FBI…

09:56.726 --> 09:59.058
don't exactly have a spotless record…

09:59.098 --> 10:01.342
when it comes to working together.

10:01.367 --> 10:05.303
And by the way, the bureau's
sorry about your accident.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.904
But personally, I've heard nothing but
good things about all of you from…

10:10.944 --> 10:14.407
Uh, agent Howard, if you could just
continue on with the briefing, please.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.108
–Thank you.
–Right.

10:17.083 --> 10:21.383
Razi Moktari used to be
just an import-export guy

10:21.454 --> 10:23.965
who sometimes found
interesting ways…

10:24.000 --> 10:25.618
around paying customs.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.355
But after the invasion of Iraq,
like a lot of muslims…

10:29.395 --> 10:32.358
he became more political.
We put him on our watch list.

10:32.398 --> 10:34.156
Last year, he got involved with an…

10:34.196 --> 10:36.029
islamic charity that funds schools,

10:36.069 --> 10:39.332
hospitals, and, we believe,
possible terrorist activities.

10:39.372 --> 10:43.068
Do you have any direct evidence
that links Razi to them?

10:44.711 --> 10:47.774
I have not had a chance to go
through all our information.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.577
In other words, no.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.046
I'd like to recommend that we
raise the terror alert level

10:53.086 --> 10:54.514
to british racing green.

10:54.554 --> 10:58.151
Is it true FBI computers aren't
connected to the internet?

10:58.191 --> 10:59.385
We're upgrading our systems.

10:59.425 --> 11:03.156
On the off chance that you might be
able to provide a single direct answer…

11:03.196 --> 11:06.559
to one of our questions, I'd like to
ask how long you've been assigned

11:06.599 --> 11:07.760
to the terrorist division.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.999
About 3 hours.

11:09.068 --> 11:12.098
–I usually head up the gang task force.
–Gangs.

11:12.138 --> 11:16.097
Actually, chief Pope,
there is some overlap

11:17.110 --> 11:19.172
between gangs and terrorist groups.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.574
They both get most of their
money from drug trafficking,

11:21.614 --> 11:23.876
and they both work real hard
to move that money around

11:23.916 --> 11:25.144
without attracting attention.

11:25.184 --> 11:28.081
We suspect Mr Moktari was
involved with that pipeline.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.783
As a matter of fact, my colleagues
were in the process of tracking…

11:30.823 --> 11:33.987
$2 million in cash that had just
come into Moktari's possession

11:34.027 --> 11:35.188
at the time he was killed.

11:35.228 --> 11:38.491
How did you know about that
money in the first place?

11:38.531 --> 11:42.755
Unfortunately, that's classified.
But I can share this with you.

11:43.303 --> 11:47.205
If you'll take one,
pass the rest around…

11:51.411 --> 11:52.810
Here are…

11:55.114 --> 11:56.604
50 names.

11:56.983 --> 12:00.580
Friends, enemies, other individuals
who might be involved with Moktari.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.783
I would like some of you to start here.
Divvy up the suspects,

12:03.823 --> 12:05.200
run their credit reports.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.686
Thank you, agent Howard.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.488
I think everyone here knows
how to do a background check.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.294
So we have a lot of work and not
a lot of bodies, so let's get busy.

12:14.334 --> 12:19.632
And on behalf of the L. A. P. D, agent
Howard, I'd like to wish you a successful…

12:19.672 --> 12:23.202
and swift, speedy, very, very fast
conclusion to your investigation.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.750
Well, it's good to see you, too, Will.

12:28.014 --> 12:32.212
–I have to interview Mrs Moktari.
–Ok.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.785
Uh, no, sergeant.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.717
I think you should stay here
and sort through all that material…

12:37.757 --> 12:40.620
from the parking garage.
Finding that S. U. V. is our first priority.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.762
–Well, who's going with you?
–Uh, agent Howard.

12:45.431 --> 12:48.298
–Yeah. Ok.
–Won't be long.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.030
Right. Yeah. Good luck with that.

12:51.738 --> 12:54.067
Not the friendliest
group I've ever met with.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.681
Well, they're a little slow to warm up.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.722
–Deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
–Come in.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.389
Agent Howard, FBI.

13:19.365 --> 13:22.095
Our hospitality, it's suffered
since the death of my father.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.178
The FBI has taken even our teacups.

13:24.218 --> 13:26.299
Sorry about the search.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.634
I'll try and have everything
returned as soon as possible,

13:28.674 --> 13:30.370
but we really need to
talk to your mother.

13:30.410 --> 13:33.172
The women of this house are
not allowed to speak with men.

13:33.212 --> 13:34.674
–We need to ask her some questions.
–No.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.045
Faraz, please…

13:37.183 --> 13:38.511
This is unacceptable.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.653
They want to know what
happened to your father.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.887
May I not speak to the woman?

13:53.366 --> 13:56.494
Thank you for taking the
time to speak with me.

13:58.404 --> 14:00.531
–Is this your daughter?
–Yes.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.303
–Are you all right?
–Oh, yeah, I'm fine. Just a little glass.

14:04.343 --> 14:09.303
Yes. Fatima. She's upstairs resting.
It's been a traumatic day.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.417
And dust from the search
has affected her asthma.

14:14.420 --> 14:17.218
–Please. Please, you must sit.
–Thank you.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.954
So sorry about what's
been done to your house.

14:21.994 --> 14:26.590
–Must be a nightmare for you.
–I am uncertain of what happened…

14:26.666 --> 14:31.365
and my son tells me nothing.
How can I help you?

14:31.671 --> 14:33.699
I'd like to know more
about your husband.

14:33.739 --> 14:36.401
They really tore this place up, Faraz.

14:36.676 --> 14:40.372
It's like they were looking
for something in particular.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.475
Any idea what that might be?

14:43.549 --> 14:45.614
Our families escaped from Iran

14:45.615 --> 14:47.859
just before Khomeini's revolution.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.983
They went to London,
and it was there they decided…

14:51.023 --> 14:52.820
we should get married.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.788
Didn't you know that your dad
recently came into a bunch of money?

14:55.828 --> 14:58.057
Who cares about money?
Someone murdered my father.

14:58.097 --> 15:01.227
Maybe because they wanted
the $2 million he was holding.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.258
What brought you to L. A.?

15:03.503 --> 15:06.165
Razi's business. 5 years ago.

15:08.107 --> 15:12.305
We thought it would be a
nice life for our children, for us.

15:14.947 --> 15:17.780
And then… all this trouble.

15:19.919 --> 15:23.650
His family in Tehran
became very political,

15:24.357 --> 15:28.384
more religious,
and everything changed.

15:31.163 --> 15:32.528
Everything.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.030
I hope my son has called our friends.

15:38.070 --> 15:41.901
There are so many people who
ought to know about Razi's death.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.713
And if you know anything
about that money,

15:45.044 --> 15:48.146
it's in your family's
best interest to tell me.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.883
Do you ever go back to Iran?

15:52.084 --> 15:55.054
We were going back next
week to visit family.

15:55.254 --> 15:58.985
That's why I was at the medical center,
get a physical before traveling.

15:59.025 --> 16:01.118
And your husband went with you.

16:01.193 --> 16:05.191
It is improper for a woman to be alone
with a man who is not her family.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.993
You mentioned to detective Daniels

16:07.033 --> 16:10.201
that you thought the
government was behind this?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.902
Look what they did to our home.

16:14.106 --> 16:18.004
You were traveling with your father.
He was teaching you his business.

16:18.044 --> 16:20.354
It's now my business and not yours.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.711
My husband was murdered,

16:23.616 --> 16:26.454
and they treat us like
he was the murderer.

16:26.586 --> 16:30.783
They took our books, our pictures,
even my daughter's prescriptions,

16:30.823 --> 16:33.121
which now I must have refilled.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.325
I'll look into that.

16:38.397 --> 16:41.264
Please. Might you come back…

16:41.334 --> 16:44.172
and tell us how the
investigation proceeds?

16:44.270 --> 16:45.669
My son…

16:48.841 --> 16:50.468
He's very angry.

16:52.411 --> 16:53.844
All right…

16:53.913 --> 16:57.410
But if in your business you happen to
come across about 2 million in cash

16:57.450 --> 17:00.513
and you try and do anything with that
money other than give it to the FBI…

17:00.553 --> 17:02.548
–You can't do anything to me.
–Really?

17:02.588 --> 17:04.817
You might want to take a
closer look at the Patriot Act.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.791
Agent Howard. You ready to go?

17:09.962 --> 17:12.726
Thanks, Faraz. I'm sorry for your loss.

17:16.969 --> 17:20.599
Layla and Fatima were both
flying to London, then to Tehran.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.762
Leaving tomorrow.

17:21.773 --> 17:24.904
But there are no reservations
for Razi or the boy.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.771
What about another airline, another day?

17:26.811 --> 17:29.308
What about another
name or another airport?

17:29.348 --> 17:32.445
I'll look into it with with
I. S. and Homeland Security.

17:32.485 --> 17:37.435
Doesn't the timing of this whole trip
seem like an awfully big coincidence?

17:42.028 --> 17:44.053
$2 million goes missing.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.559
The wife and the daughter
leaving the country.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.996
–The husband is shot down.
–That seems like a very big coincidence.

17:50.036 --> 17:54.234
Absolutely. Uh, lieutenant Tao,
any news from the coroner?

17:54.940 --> 17:58.070
Preliminary reports consistent
with eyewitness testimony.

17:58.110 --> 18:02.308
Close range, probably Razi
first, then the bodyguard.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.711
–Anything about the gun?
–Not the weapon of a repeat offender.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.412
And our elusive S. U. V.,

18:07.486 --> 18:09.818
I finally got a time-stamped record

18:09.889 --> 18:12.451
of everyone who swiped in and out
of the garage. Now here's the thing.

18:12.491 --> 18:16.451
No one left 10 minutes before
or anytime after the shooting.

18:18.497 --> 18:20.362
Car's still there.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.163
Find out everything you can
about every car in that garage.

18:24.203 --> 18:27.767
Get warrants to open 'em up and have
S. I. D go through every inch of every car.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.169
We're looking for gunshot
residue on the passenger window

18:30.209 --> 18:31.285
or even some blowback on the door.

18:31.325 --> 18:32.439
Really?

18:32.511 --> 18:36.273
Maybe I should write that down,
'cause that's news to me.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.412
Thank you all. Thank you all very much.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.012
–Thank you.
–Chief?

18:44.023 --> 18:48.587
I think my time would be better spent
on something other than the garage.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.490
But that vehicle's the
strongest lead we have right now.

18:51.530 --> 18:53.589
How many cars are there?

18:53.666 --> 18:57.530
6 floors. That's like 300 cars.
I mean, it's a 2 or 3-day job.

18:57.570 --> 18:58.764
Go see captain Taylor.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.167
I got permission from chief Pope
to appropriate personnel…

19:01.207 --> 19:03.107
from Robbery-Homicide.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.676
–Thank you, sergeant.
–Yes, ma'am.

19:15.421 --> 19:20.085
I don't mind when she takes
my resources. That's all right.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.360
But when she starts to take my friends,

19:23.996 --> 19:25.524
that's when I get upset.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.660
Well, you don't have to
worry about that, captain.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.928
I know who my friends are.

19:28.968 --> 19:32.062
But chief Johnson signs
my evaluations, so…

19:32.138 --> 19:35.401
Still, I was telling detective
Flynn here that the only time…

19:35.441 --> 19:38.504
I ever get to see you anymore
is when she wants something.

19:38.544 --> 19:41.073
–What's with that?
–Well, this time, it's me, though.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.675
I'm supervising an S. I. D team.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.177
We're running background
checks on a bunch of cars.

19:45.217 --> 19:48.653
Sounds real glamorous up
there in Priority Homicide.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.484
What is it you need,
another pair of hands?

19:51.524 --> 19:53.822
–Yeah.
–I'll go.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.592
–I mean, that'd be great. Only…
–Only what?

19:58.664 --> 20:02.561
Well, sir… Lieutenant Flynn is one of
our best guys here at the department,

20:02.601 --> 20:04.114
but he and…

20:04.115 --> 20:05.699
The bitch hates my guts.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.400
–You can say it, Gabriel.
–I don't want to say that, but…

20:08.440 --> 20:11.170
–I don't care.
–Wait a minute!

20:11.510 --> 20:13.444
Time out here. I care.

20:14.747 --> 20:18.274
We're not here to indulge
our personal feelings.

20:18.384 --> 20:22.013
We are here to protect and to serve.

20:22.788 --> 20:25.985
–Now you want to move this thing along.
–Of course, sir.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.516
And experience counts for something.

20:29.528 --> 20:33.025
Lieutenant Flynn will help guide you
through this, won't you, lieutenant?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.396
Yes, sir.

20:36.368 --> 20:37.995
Yeah. Thank you.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.603
Lieutenant Tao's found something
I think you ought to take a look at.

20:44.643 --> 20:48.407
Someone as professional as this shooter
needs to keep in practice,

20:48.447 --> 20:52.076
so I called firing ranges.
Got a list of customers

20:52.651 --> 20:56.280
and I googled those names.
That's an internet thing.

20:56.355 --> 20:57.716
Yeah, I know what Google is, lieutenant.

20:57.756 --> 21:01.584
It's the FBI that has a hard
time getting on-line, not me.

21:01.694 --> 21:05.255
Anyway, this is what turned up.

21:05.331 --> 21:09.028
A guy named Craig Sherman is
claiming credit for killing Razi Moktari.

21:09.068 --> 21:12.164
“Time for patriotic Americans
to free themselves from terror.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.296
PROTECT AMERICA

21:13.372 --> 21:16.268
Our duty to execute them
before they execute us.”

21:16.308 --> 21:19.772
It says no muslim is innocent,
and Razi Moktari is only the first.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.675
All right, we need to get some units over
to this Craig Sherman's house right away.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.110
I'll call over, see if I
can't get us FBI backup.

21:25.150 --> 21:29.143
Oh, didn't I tell you?
We picked him up 15 minutes ago.

21:32.615 --> 21:37.037
Put him in interview one with
the other men for the lineup, please.

21:42.325 --> 21:45.192
So that's the mighty Craig Sherman, huh?

21:46.996 --> 21:49.123
Listen, we searched his house.

21:49.198 --> 21:51.894
–There's no sign of the $2 million.
–Really?

21:51.934 --> 21:54.363
Well, how about
a gun or a dark S. U. V.?

21:54.403 --> 21:56.499
'Cause I thought we were
investigating a murder,

21:56.539 --> 22:00.367
but y'all seem to be running
more of a treasure hunt here.

22:01.444 --> 22:03.469
Can I talk to you?

22:12.488 --> 22:14.283
The missing $2 million
we've been tracking…

22:14.323 --> 22:16.154
is yours, isn't it?

22:16.392 --> 22:18.688
Moktari got that money
through an FBI middleman.

22:18.728 --> 22:21.057
Y'all were planning on tracing
that money as it left L. A.

22:21.097 --> 22:22.558
Now y'all can't find it.

22:22.598 --> 22:24.994
Hey, listen, enough
with the “y'all,” ok?

22:25.034 --> 22:27.930
I had nothing to do with this.
Do you think I wanted this assignment?

22:27.970 --> 22:30.800
I was given direct orders.
I've got to follow them.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.135
Look, you're working a
murder. That's important.

22:33.175 --> 22:35.604
But so is keeping $2 million
out of the hands of terrorists.

22:35.644 --> 22:38.107
The FBI shouldn't have given him
that money in the first place.

22:38.147 --> 22:40.976
And so far you haven't provided
one single piece of evidence

22:41.016 --> 22:42.845
that Razi Moktari was a terrorist,

22:42.885 --> 22:45.525
because if you had, we wouldn't be here.

22:47.623 --> 22:50.353
Brenda. What a surprise.

22:51.560 --> 22:56.259
Well, the ladies' room
never has any toilet paper ever.

23:02.371 --> 23:03.736
Hey, Will.

23:10.780 --> 23:13.442
Thank you, sir. Thanks for coming.

23:15.584 --> 23:19.213
Hello. I'm Dr William Graham.
From yesterday.

23:19.855 --> 23:21.117
Oh, yes.

23:21.757 --> 23:25.020
–Are you doing all right?
–We're fine. Thank you for asking.

23:25.060 --> 23:27.028
We're ready for you now.

23:33.669 --> 23:36.966
If you recognize anyone,
just write the numbers down.

23:37.006 --> 23:38.530
Go ahead, Buzz.

23:53.656 --> 23:56.523
–I don't recognize any of them.
–Ma'am?

23:58.027 --> 24:00.656
–Ok, thank you your time.
–Wait a minute. One of these men…

24:00.696 --> 24:03.025
–It's one of these men.
–Here. You can use this door.

24:03.065 --> 24:04.623
Faraz, please.

24:09.872 --> 24:11.703
Go ahead and record this.

24:14.176 --> 24:17.476
–What are they saying?
–My farsi's a little rusty.

24:31.727 --> 24:34.093
Del

24:35.431 --> 24:37.081
Settle down! Settle down!

24:40.703 --> 24:42.898
You're sure you don't
want to press charges?

24:42.938 --> 24:44.997
My son is emotional.

24:45.407 --> 24:48.376
It's hard for a boy to lose his father.

24:50.446 --> 24:53.746
Please, we would like to
go back to our house now.

24:54.283 --> 24:57.781
If you don't want to go home,
if you don't feel safe,

24:58.487 --> 25:01.721
we can find a place for you
for a couple of days.

25:02.291 --> 25:05.226
–Protect you.
–Like you protected my father?

25:08.397 --> 25:09.989
Mother, you will come.

25:20.876 --> 25:24.903
Look, if she insists on protecting him,
nothing we can do.

25:30.653 --> 25:32.052
Mr Sherman.

25:32.688 --> 25:34.850
Normally I don't conduct
interviews like this

25:34.890 --> 25:37.152
until I know a little
bit more about a person,

25:37.192 --> 25:39.522
but you seem to be in a
hurry to get to prison,

25:39.562 --> 25:42.598
so I thought I'd help
speed the process along.

25:43.165 --> 25:45.528
–So they've read you your rights?
–Twice.

25:45.568 --> 25:47.830
–And you don't want an attorney?
–No.

25:47.870 --> 25:51.901
And you've already admitted to killing
Razi Moktari and Jeffrey Sanders?

25:51.941 --> 25:54.303
–Yes.
–Well, congratulations, Mr Sherman.

25:54.343 --> 25:57.239
You've done just about everything
but give yourself a lethal injection.

25:57.279 --> 25:59.341
I'm not afraid to die for my country.

25:59.381 --> 26:01.477
They don't have a monopoly
on martyrdom, you know.

26:01.517 --> 26:04.509
We can decide the
question of who “they” are.

26:05.354 --> 26:07.652
Why did you target Razi Moktari?

26:07.723 --> 26:09.685
–He's Iranian.
–Is he a terrorist?

26:09.725 --> 26:12.755
Do they stop and ask if the Americans
they've killed are terrorists?

26:12.795 --> 26:15.320
No. You have to fight fire with fire.

26:16.932 --> 26:19.828
They changed the rules
of engagement, not me.

26:19.868 --> 26:21.927
That's very interesting. I…

26:22.237 --> 26:25.034
I've never thought of
terrorism quite like that.

26:25.074 --> 26:28.506
It's called asymmetrical warfare, ma'am.
Look it up.

26:29.211 --> 26:32.675
You've given this a lot of thought,
this counterattack of yours.

26:32.715 --> 26:33.841
Thank you.

26:33.916 --> 26:36.111
I'm trying to set
an example others can follow.

26:36.151 --> 26:38.989
So how did you get so
close to your target?

26:41.323 --> 26:44.815
Research. Know your enemy.

26:45.728 --> 26:49.892
That's the first rule of war.
Research. Know your enemy.

26:50.733 --> 26:53.307
Ever read Sun Tzu
and “The Art Of War”?

26:53.335 --> 26:56.999
Attack where they are not prepared.
Go out to where they do not expect.

26:57.039 --> 27:00.133
I picked a contained
place where he felt safe,

27:00.509 --> 27:02.704
and when my enemy appeared,

27:02.778 --> 27:05.908
I blocked his escape route
and emptied my weapon.

27:05.948 --> 27:09.044
Aimed at the midsection to hit
as many vital organs as possible.

27:09.084 --> 27:11.847
–Explain the order of your attack.
–I took out the bodyguard first

27:11.887 --> 27:16.177
because I didn't want to get shot
before my mission was complete.

27:16.492 --> 27:18.551
–And the gun?
–Tossed it.

27:18.694 --> 27:21.254
–And the car?
–Not mine. Not telling.

27:21.430 --> 27:24.331
–And you headed out the main exit?
–Yes.

27:25.567 --> 27:27.694
Why didn't you shoot the wife?

27:34.143 --> 27:37.740
There's nothing to arrest him for,
'cause he obviously didn't do it.

27:37.780 --> 27:40.681
Being a publicity junkie's not a crime.

27:41.250 --> 27:43.469
Something he said really bothers me.

27:43.509 --> 27:44.509
What's that?

27:44.516 --> 27:47.046
The attack he described is textbook.

27:47.556 --> 27:50.586
Is better, in fact, than
what actually happened.

27:50.626 --> 27:55.246
Detective Tao, could you walk me
through the ballistics one more time.

27:59.435 --> 28:00.462
Bang!

28:00.463 --> 28:02.131
We believe the first hit was here,

28:02.171 --> 28:06.131
then as Moktari spun from the impact,
the next one was here,

28:06.575 --> 28:09.271
bouncing him off the car, and here.

28:10.345 --> 28:11.587
And just before he fell…

28:11.627 --> 28:14.663
the last one went through
the top of his head.

28:15.284 --> 28:18.185
The shooter kept firing
after Moktari fell.

28:18.253 --> 28:20.616
Those were the 3
misses against the wall.

28:20.656 --> 28:22.954
Then he turned on the bodyguard,

28:23.025 --> 28:27.086
twice in the gut,
one in the arm,

28:28.297 --> 28:30.765
and the last one in the neck.

28:33.669 --> 28:37.959
Let's go through it again in real time
without all the… stabbing.

28:48.484 --> 28:53.148
Bang! Bang bang bang bang…
–Stop!

28:54.423 --> 28:57.186
Does this seem strange to anyone else?
That in all that time…

28:57.226 --> 29:00.064
Jeffrey Sanders couldn't
get off one round?

29:02.331 --> 29:04.663
Let's take a look at his weapon.

29:05.601 --> 29:09.231
It was rather ingenious,
but simple enough a child could do it.

29:09.271 --> 29:12.263
Someone put superglue in the firing pin.

29:13.175 --> 29:14.642
And that jammed it.

29:15.778 --> 29:18.073
Sanders wouldn't have
noticed it with his naked eye.

29:18.113 --> 29:20.013
He could chamber a round.

29:20.082 --> 29:22.986
You'd have to take the
gun apart to find it.

29:23.719 --> 29:26.244
So whoever did this…

29:27.422 --> 29:30.452
knew they didn't have to worry about
shooting the bodyguard first

29:30.492 --> 29:33.055
because they knew his
gun wouldn't go off.

29:33.095 --> 29:35.359
Who had access to that weapon?

29:37.733 --> 29:41.697
Buzz, will you please make me a tape
of the argument from this afternoon.

29:41.737 --> 29:44.166
Detective Tao, find agent Howard for me.

29:44.206 --> 29:48.403
And see if there's anyone available
in the department who speaks farsi.

29:48.443 --> 29:51.378
I want to find out what
this boy was saying.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.063
–The boy's upset with his mother.
–Well, we knew that.

29:58.103 --> 29:59.263
Ok.

30:01.206 --> 30:05.438
The boy says, “I'm the head of
household. You will do as I say.

30:06.011 --> 30:09.808
One of them must pay for father.”
She says, “please calm down.”

30:09.848 --> 30:12.811
And he says, “enough. Next
week, you will go home,

30:12.851 --> 30:17.207
where the air is pure for Fatima
and the people are pure for you.”

30:17.656 --> 30:20.285
“But who will look
after you?” That's her.

30:20.325 --> 30:24.747
And he says, “I've found father's money.
I will look after myself.”

30:25.030 --> 30:27.897
“But you're just a
child…” What was that?

30:28.300 --> 30:31.827
–He hit her.
–And she hit him back.

30:32.704 --> 30:36.936
–Could we go back through that again?
–Excuse us, chief.

30:37.142 --> 30:39.104
We just finished up with
the last of the cars.

30:39.144 --> 30:41.840
No G. S. R., no blowback, nothing.

30:42.080 --> 30:44.071
Well, thank you, sergeant.

30:44.149 --> 30:46.302
Lieutenant Flynn, pleasure as always.

30:46.342 --> 30:47.342
Yeah.

30:47.385 --> 30:51.049
–Go ahead and release the crime scene.
–Excuse me, ma'am?

30:51.089 --> 30:52.181
What?

30:52.257 --> 30:57.207
Well, how would you like us to proceed?
You know, in locating the S. U. V.?

30:59.297 --> 31:00.594
Never mind.

31:00.665 --> 31:02.794
We'll try a new tack on
the car in the morning.

31:02.834 --> 31:05.132
Thank you. Thank you, sergeant.

31:07.238 --> 31:11.803
Go back to the part where the boy talked
about the air being pure for his sister.

31:11.843 --> 31:13.868
I want to hear that again.

31:16.715 --> 31:18.182
Where's Fritz?

31:18.516 --> 31:20.507
Yeah, the boy's got the money.

31:20.585 --> 31:22.480
–You know what's funny?
–What?

31:22.520 --> 31:23.615
She can't stand me.

31:23.655 --> 31:25.850
I've done everything I can
to make her life miserable,

31:25.890 --> 31:28.653
and here you are, you've tried
to help her out whenever you could

31:28.693 --> 31:31.663
and she treats us both
exactly the same. Heh!

31:42.107 --> 31:43.802
Deputy chief Johnson.

31:43.875 --> 31:48.340
I assume you're here to tell me that
you've arrested Mr Moktari's son.

31:48.380 --> 31:50.642
Where'd you take him?
Egypt? Saudi Arabia?

31:50.682 --> 31:52.344
I'm not at liberty to say.

31:52.384 --> 31:57.582
But he is the son of a terrorist with a
lot of money, and we need to get it back.

31:57.622 --> 32:01.353
Though your lack of respect
for my professional ability…

32:01.726 --> 32:06.214
couldn't be more obvious, I'd like
to share an observation with you.

32:06.364 --> 32:10.494
I think that physical torture
is an extremely unreliable means

32:10.568 --> 32:12.764
of extracting information from people.

32:12.804 --> 32:16.034
And allowing you to remove a
murder suspect from our jurisdiction

32:16.074 --> 32:18.235
is hardly what we agreed to.

32:18.309 --> 32:21.543
There may be no need to
interrogate Faraz at all.

32:21.546 --> 32:25.777
In fact, I think knowing her son's in foreign
custody might provide Mrs Moktari…

32:25.817 --> 32:28.684
with enough incentive
to cooperate with us.

32:29.053 --> 32:31.078
We're not working against you.

32:31.156 --> 32:33.718
We're just providing you
with the necessary leverage

32:33.758 --> 32:35.820
to find out exactly
what the mother knows.

32:35.860 --> 32:38.693
Besides, an observant islamic woman

32:38.863 --> 32:41.326
is much more likely to talk
to me than she is to you.

32:41.366 --> 32:45.128
I look forward to seeing
you in action, ma'am. Gentlemen.

32:48.706 --> 32:52.670
So if I can't get Mrs Moktari
to tell me what they want to hear,

32:52.710 --> 32:55.340
they're gonna beat the
confession out of the kid.

32:55.380 --> 32:59.868
Don't complain to me. Complain to
your trustworthy FBI advisor here.

33:06.524 --> 33:09.925
I want you to know I only
reported what Faraz said.

33:10.228 --> 33:13.858
I had nothing to do with how
that information was used.

33:14.165 --> 33:15.325
Look…

33:20.104 --> 33:22.734
I have really strong feelings
for you, but I can't…

33:22.774 --> 33:25.546
Brenda, hey, before
you say anything else,

33:26.211 --> 33:27.336
effective tomorrow morning,

33:27.376 --> 33:30.676
I am officially removed
from this whole operation.

33:31.449 --> 33:34.350
It's not my beat in the
first place, and…

33:36.354 --> 33:39.258
I have equally strong
feelings for you, too.

33:41.092 --> 33:45.844
Which is why you're better off
finishing this investigation on your own.

33:46.231 --> 33:47.926
I appreciate that.

33:51.169 --> 33:55.333
But, before you finish up your paperwork,
I just need one tiny favor from you.

33:55.373 --> 33:59.070
–Can we have dinner tomorrow night?
–Yes, of course.

34:00.478 --> 34:03.641
If I'm expected to get Mrs
Moktari to flip on her son,

34:03.681 --> 34:05.477
it'd be helpful for me
to look through everything

34:05.517 --> 34:07.827
that the FBI took out of her house.

34:09.087 --> 34:11.349
You looking for anything in particular?

34:11.389 --> 34:14.483
Yes. Her daughter's prescriptions.

34:16.860 --> 34:18.851
I want to give 'em back.

34:23.167 --> 34:25.533
Del

34:26.905 --> 34:30.301
Getting a mother to give up her son
might be a bit much to ask.

34:30.341 --> 34:31.899
Even of Brenda.

34:33.578 --> 34:36.746
We'll settle for knowing
where the money got to.

34:37.982 --> 34:41.980
Thank you so much, Dr Graham
for coming in this one last time.

34:42.020 --> 34:44.284
This should just take a minute.

34:52.530 --> 34:55.987
I am so sorry to put you in
here with another man,

34:56.266 --> 35:01.000
but you were the only 2 witnesses
who saw the murderer's escape,

35:01.339 --> 35:04.736
and we have spent so much
time searching for that S. U. V.,

35:04.776 --> 35:07.836
so in an attempt to
end all the confusion,

35:07.912 --> 35:11.543
I put one of the best cops I've
ever worked with on the job,

35:11.583 --> 35:14.950
and he searched through
every car in that garage

35:15.153 --> 35:17.463
because witnesses get
things wrong…

35:17.488 --> 35:18.853
sometimes.

35:19.324 --> 35:22.316
Anyway, we couldn't
find the shooter's car,

35:23.161 --> 35:25.026
and I finally realized why.

35:25.096 --> 35:28.330
And I could've kicked
myself for being so stupid,

35:28.366 --> 35:31.488
and it's because there was no S. U. V.

35:31.523 --> 35:33.030
It just didn't exist.

35:33.905 --> 35:37.534
–What?
–No getaway car. No vehicle at all.

35:39.077 --> 35:40.567
But… But that's…

35:41.112 --> 35:42.579
I know, Dr Graham.

35:42.647 --> 35:46.945
I was surprised, too. Because you two
just met each other yesterday,

35:46.985 --> 35:50.281
and it's very rare to find 2 witnesses
who don't know each other

35:50.321 --> 35:52.585
telling the exact same lie.

35:56.094 --> 36:00.912
So then I thought, “well, maybe they're
just pretending to be strangers.”

36:01.165 --> 36:04.430
You told me that your
daughter Fatima has asthma,

36:04.502 --> 36:07.031
and Dr Graham here is
a pulmonary specialist.

36:07.071 --> 36:08.868
He treats lung disorders.

36:08.940 --> 36:12.740
So I went looking for the medication

36:12.944 --> 36:16.277
that the FBI took out of your house,

36:16.614 --> 36:19.048
and lo and behold,

36:19.951 --> 36:23.079
prescribing physician
was none other than…

36:23.788 --> 36:25.585
Dr William Graham.

36:30.094 --> 36:33.262
Leila, it would be better
to let me handle this.

36:33.765 --> 36:35.096
We want a lawyer.

36:35.166 --> 36:38.763
Listen to me, Leila, because I
think you may have had enough

36:38.803 --> 36:41.443
of men making all the
decisions for you,

36:41.472 --> 36:44.869
and if you bring a lawyer in here,
I'm handing this whole mess…

36:44.909 --> 36:47.673
over to the men of the FBI.

36:48.813 --> 36:52.806
They already have Faraz.
I think they've taken him to Egypt.

36:58.890 --> 37:00.653
You cannot do that.

37:01.392 --> 37:04.692
He is only behaving the
way his father taught him.

37:05.396 --> 37:07.921
He's… He's going through…

37:09.267 --> 37:10.734
He's not a terrorist.

37:10.802 --> 37:13.197
Leila, for god's sake, don't
speak. Don't say a word.

37:13.237 --> 37:14.799
Dr Graham, you say one more word,

37:14.839 --> 37:18.236
and I'm arresting you for
murder in the first degree.

37:18.276 --> 37:20.335
You see how easy that was?

37:20.912 --> 37:23.975
You don't have to cede all
your authority to a man.

37:24.015 --> 37:27.183
You can make this next
decision all by yourself.

37:27.351 --> 37:30.717
Do you want an attorney?
You have the right to one.

37:31.989 --> 37:33.951
Maybe you'd like to remain silent,

37:33.991 --> 37:37.145
since everything you say can
and will be used against you…

37:37.185 --> 37:38.322
in a court of law.

37:38.362 --> 37:42.162
But if you waive those rights
for the next few minutes,

37:42.600 --> 37:45.262
you can make a few decisions yourself.

37:54.979 --> 37:57.038
–I waive my rights.
–See?

37:57.682 --> 38:00.412
You're taking
back control bit by bit.

38:05.323 --> 38:07.621
Someone tampered with this gun.

38:10.661 --> 38:12.458
You can tell me who.

38:14.165 --> 38:18.534
And with your answer,
you could be deciding who lives…

38:20.204 --> 38:21.728
and who dies.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.530
Was it Faraz?

38:25.910 --> 38:29.540
Does he belong in a foreign prison?
does he deserve to be tortured?

38:29.580 --> 38:32.674
Or did you glue this firing
pin in place?

38:32.984 --> 38:35.713
Because you began having
an affair with Dr Graham.

38:35.753 --> 38:37.220
Who could blame you?

38:37.288 --> 38:40.651
Razi was treating you like a prisoner.
He was taking you back to Iran.

38:40.691 --> 38:43.387
He wasn't sending me back to Iran!

38:45.062 --> 38:48.054
He was sending me back
to the 17th century.

38:54.338 --> 38:56.568
I couldn't live like that…

38:57.575 --> 39:00.806
Shut away, afraid even to speak.

39:03.981 --> 39:05.676
That's not a life.

39:10.621 --> 39:15.115
–Tell me what happened the other day.
–Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

39:24.535 --> 39:27.971
We planned it around my doctor visit.

39:30.241 --> 39:33.369
William cut the lines
to the security cameras,

39:35.046 --> 39:38.846
and as we were leaving,
coming out of the elevator,

39:40.651 --> 39:44.314
he walk… he walked over to Razi

39:45.556 --> 39:47.285
and fired the gun,

39:48.426 --> 39:51.156
and then he put it in his pocket.

39:54.498 --> 39:58.798
Please, don't let them
hurt Faraz. Please!

40:07.712 --> 40:09.805
William, I'm so sorry.

40:13.818 --> 40:16.616
He was only trying to save me.

40:23.861 --> 40:27.557
I think you may be able to
convince a jury of that, too.

40:33.170 --> 40:35.216
But what about Jeffrey Sanders?

40:35.973 --> 40:41.253
An innocent man that you killed just so
you wouldn't leave behind any witnesses.

40:45.049 --> 40:46.516
Thank you, Ms Johnson.

40:46.584 --> 40:50.314
I have a federal warrant here
for the arrest of Leila Moktari,

40:50.354 --> 40:54.418
and I'd consider it a personal favor if
you'd turn the doctor over to us as well.

40:54.458 --> 40:57.518
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

40:59.063 --> 41:02.464
What's going on? Let…
Let my son go free.

41:02.667 --> 41:06.297
He had nothing to do with this.
Please, please help me!

42:22.513 --> 42:26.711
–So I guess you heard.
–We handed Layla over to the CIA.

42:28.552 --> 42:31.487
And they'll send her
back to Iran, no doubt.

42:33.024 --> 42:35.822
A rare intelligence asset on the ground.

42:37.061 --> 42:40.326
Well… We got Dr Graham.

42:42.133 --> 42:43.430
On a plea deal.

42:43.501 --> 42:45.596
Probably sign a
confidentiality agreement,

42:45.636 --> 42:47.866
serve time for manslaughter.

42:47.938 --> 42:49.405
You all right?

42:51.108 --> 42:55.794
They lured Razi to his death and killed
an innocent man in the process…

42:57.081 --> 42:59.787
when she could've
just filed for divorce.

43:00.751 --> 43:03.311
I can't think of a single culture

43:03.654 --> 43:07.878
where that's the right way
for a woman to gain her independence.

43:11.162 --> 43:13.528
So did y'all find your money?

43:14.465 --> 43:17.400
Faraz had half of it.
The rest of it's gone.

43:19.970 --> 43:23.736
–You must be upset.
–You know what would make me upset?

43:25.242 --> 43:30.060
Is if this whole working together thing
screwed up our whole other thing.

44:01.212 --> 44:04.613
Fine. Let's go to dinner.

44:22.066 --> 44:23.761
But you're paying.
