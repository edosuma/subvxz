Merry Christmas!

08:59.846 --> 09:01.345
Nice idea, Carrie.

09:07.854 --> 09:10.588
[♪♪♪]

09:10.624 --> 09:12.056
All right, let's settle,
everyone.

09:12.091 --> 09:13.558
I know
we're all in holiday mode,

09:13.593 --> 09:15.760
but we still have
the news to do.

09:15.796 --> 09:17.695
First up,
I would like to congratulate

09:17.731 --> 09:19.997
our own intrepid Hanna Dunbar

09:20.033 --> 09:23.701
for once again
going for the jugular.

09:23.737 --> 09:26.203
Come on, you guys.
Fish in a barrel.

09:26.239 --> 09:28.773
Now, Hanna is working
on a follow-up,

09:28.809 --> 09:29.874
to let our audience know

09:29.910 --> 09:31.709
the right places for them
to make their donations.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.945
Actually, there's a different
idea I want to run by you.

09:33.980 --> 09:35.647
Okay.

09:35.682 --> 09:37.248
And Carrie deserves
some credit on this.

09:37.283 --> 09:39.150
She was a big help
pulling it together.

09:39.185 --> 09:40.919
I like how you're
bringing her along.

09:40.954 --> 09:41.920
Let's hear it.

09:41.955 --> 09:43.755
There's a family
shelter downtown

09:43.790 --> 09:45.122
that's been there
for nearly 20 years.

09:45.158 --> 09:47.659
The woman who runs it,
Helen Sander,

09:47.694 --> 09:49.193
was actually living
on the streets herself

09:49.228 --> 09:50.227
for a time.

09:50.263 --> 09:53.197
And that's where she was,
Christmas Eve,

09:53.232 --> 09:55.600
nearly 20 years ago...

09:55.635 --> 09:57.602
[footsteps echoing]

09:57.637 --> 09:59.737
Ahh! I just heard
the great news!

09:59.773 --> 10:00.872
We got the green light
for the shelter story!

10:00.907 --> 10:02.239
Grant loved the idea.

10:02.275 --> 10:03.942
Oh, that is so cool.

10:03.977 --> 10:06.344
Okay. So, what happens now?
I mean, how do we do this?

10:06.379 --> 10:07.946
Let's get
an interview set up

10:07.981 --> 10:09.246
with Helen Sander
right away.

10:09.282 --> 10:10.682
I want to do it at the shelter,

10:10.717 --> 10:11.983
but find out if she has

10:12.018 --> 10:13.751
an office,
someplace quiet,

10:13.787 --> 10:15.353
where I can really talk to her.

10:16.756 --> 10:19.190
Oh. Um... I thought--

10:20.393 --> 10:21.860
What's wrong?

10:21.895 --> 10:22.861
N-- No.

10:22.896 --> 10:24.128
I mean, I just, um...

10:24.163 --> 10:25.797
I thought,
when I pitched you the story--

10:25.832 --> 10:27.264
And you did a fine job,

10:27.300 --> 10:29.767
but I had to put
my own spin on it,

10:29.803 --> 10:32.169
that's what sold
Grant on the story.

10:33.673 --> 10:35.874
Right. [forced chuckle]

10:38.277 --> 10:39.377
Carrie--

10:39.412 --> 10:41.880
Listen,
I know it's hard,

10:41.915 --> 10:43.948
but you're not ready
to step in front of the camera,

10:43.984 --> 10:45.650
not yet,
but you'll get there.

10:45.685 --> 10:48.185
Trust me.
Don't worry.

10:48.221 --> 10:49.387
You just have to be patient.

10:49.422 --> 10:51.255
You're right.

10:52.425 --> 10:55.259
And in the meantime,
I think we make a great team.

10:55.294 --> 10:57.428
So I'm counting on you

10:57.463 --> 10:59.430
to keep doing all of
the great things you do here,

10:59.465 --> 11:00.865
so I can do what I do

11:00.901 --> 11:02.934
and, together,

11:02.969 --> 11:05.236
we can make this story
another win for the team.

11:05.271 --> 11:07.138
That sound good?

11:07.173 --> 11:09.206
Absolutely.

11:10.410 --> 11:12.243
I'll get that interview
set up right away.

19:51.264 --> 19:52.463
They're your boots.

19:54.700 --> 19:57.535
This is mine, too?

19:57.570 --> 19:58.702
Yeah.

19:58.737 --> 20:00.737
Uh-huh.

20:02.508 --> 20:03.674
A mini-van?

20:05.010 --> 20:06.944
Hanna, what's going on?

20:06.979 --> 20:10.548
I'll bring it back.

20:10.583 --> 20:12.516
Hanna?

20:12.552 --> 20:13.784
Hanna?

20:13.819 --> 20:15.453
What are you doing?

20:16.822 --> 20:18.422
Come on.

20:18.458 --> 20:19.823
Hanna?

20:19.858 --> 20:21.825
Come on.

20:36.123 --> 20:37.556
[sighing] Stuart,

20:37.591 --> 20:38.790
you would not believe
the morning I'm having.

20:38.825 --> 20:39.857
Excuse me?

20:39.893 --> 20:41.359
Visitors
have to check in.

20:41.395 --> 20:42.360
I have to call you up.

20:42.396 --> 20:43.361
What are you talking about?

20:43.397 --> 20:44.362
Stuart, it's me.

20:44.398 --> 20:46.331
Look, I don't know
how you know my name,

20:46.366 --> 20:48.467
but you're not going anywhere
unless I call you up first.

20:48.502 --> 20:50.569
But I-I live here.

20:50.604 --> 20:52.471
It's Hanna Dunbar, 8-B?

20:52.506 --> 20:55.240
Lady, I've never laid eyes
on you before in my life.

20:55.275 --> 20:58.676
And I'm pretty sure
I'd remember those pajamas.

21:01.748 --> 21:04.416
Hi, I left my key card,

21:04.451 --> 21:05.417
and I need to get into
my office.

21:05.452 --> 21:06.418
You work here?

21:06.453 --> 21:08.686
Of course. Hanna Dunbar.

21:08.722 --> 21:09.754
[typing]

21:09.789 --> 21:11.590
Sorry.

21:12.892 --> 21:15.660
Hanna Dunbar.
News division.

21:15.695 --> 21:17.262
There's no Hanna Dunbar.

21:17.297 --> 21:18.830
Have a nice day.

21:18.865 --> 21:22.334
Is Grant Walker in his office?

21:22.369 --> 21:24.302
He's not here.
It's Sunday.

21:24.338 --> 21:25.370
Right.

21:25.405 --> 21:27.172
Okay, well, could you please
call him at home?

21:27.207 --> 21:28.173
Tell him it's me,

21:28.208 --> 21:29.541
and he needs to get
down here right away.

21:29.576 --> 21:31.209
[sighing]
You've got to be kidding me.

21:31.245 --> 21:33.211
No, it's all right, I promise.

21:33.247 --> 21:35.514
Are you wearing pajamas?

21:37.584 --> 21:39.884
Listen, I really
don't want to be

21:39.919 --> 21:41.186
that person,

21:41.221 --> 21:44.356
but I have won
a number of national awards,

21:44.391 --> 21:46.924
including three Emmys
for my reporting.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.327
My ratings are the highest
in this station's history.

21:50.531 --> 21:52.264
You know what, wait,
call my assistant.

21:52.299 --> 21:53.265
Ask her to come down.

21:53.300 --> 21:54.332
Her name is Carrie Garrett.

21:54.368 --> 21:55.567
Your assistant
is Carrie Garrett?

21:55.602 --> 21:56.568
Yes.

21:56.603 --> 21:57.569
Please call her.

21:57.604 --> 21:59.571
That Carrie Garrett?

22:12.219 --> 22:13.718
No. No, no, no, this is my job!

22:13.753 --> 22:15.720
This is my job!

22:24.731 --> 22:26.998
[bell jingling]

22:34.508 --> 22:36.608
Merry Christmas!

22:36.643 --> 22:37.809
Thank you.

22:40.247 --> 22:41.313
Hi.

22:41.348 --> 22:42.747
Uh...

22:42.782 --> 22:43.848
Do you know me?

22:43.883 --> 22:46.585
I think what
you're really asking, Hanna,

22:46.620 --> 22:48.520
is do I know
what's going on?

22:48.555 --> 22:49.821
[sighing]
You do know me.

22:49.856 --> 22:50.822
Oh, thank you.

22:50.857 --> 22:52.390
Thank you.

22:52.426 --> 22:54.359
I thought
I was losing my mind.

22:54.394 --> 22:55.727
You're not
losing your mind.

22:55.762 --> 22:57.295
I don't understand, though.

22:57.331 --> 22:59.264
What is going on?
What is happening to me?

22:59.299 --> 23:01.299
I have no idea.

23:01.335 --> 23:02.334
What?

23:02.369 --> 23:04.636
Sorry. Not a clue.

23:04.671 --> 23:06.804
What... what are you
talking about?

23:06.840 --> 23:08.640
This can't just happen.

23:08.675 --> 23:10.775
I woke up this morning,
and my life was gone.

23:10.810 --> 23:13.411
Yeah, I know. Weird, right?

23:13.447 --> 23:14.412
No, not weird,

23:14.448 --> 23:15.413
impossible!

23:15.449 --> 23:16.814
People don't just wake up

23:16.850 --> 23:19.150
and find themselves leading
completely different lives.

23:19.185 --> 23:20.151
[chuckling]

23:20.186 --> 23:22.153
And yet, here we stand.

23:22.188 --> 23:23.655
[ringing bell]

23:23.690 --> 23:24.956
Will you just
stop that, please?

23:24.991 --> 23:25.957
Thanks.

23:25.992 --> 23:27.659
Listen, this is
unacceptable, okay?

23:27.694 --> 23:30.762
I'm starting a great new job,
and I just want my life back.

23:30.797 --> 23:32.697
Please tell me
what I am supposed do.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.433
How should I know?

23:35.469 --> 23:36.635
This is your wish.

23:37.738 --> 23:40.104
Wish? What...
What wish?

23:40.140 --> 23:41.139
Remember?

23:41.174 --> 23:42.674
At the party,

23:42.709 --> 23:45.042
I said, "It looks like
someone in here

23:45.078 --> 23:46.678
might have a Christmas wish
on their mind."

23:46.713 --> 23:48.513
And I said, "No."

23:49.549 --> 23:50.948
Are you sure?

23:52.085 --> 23:54.018
Well...

23:54.053 --> 23:57.622
Are you saying that I...
I did this?

23:58.725 --> 24:01.025
All I know is that eventually

24:01.060 --> 24:03.928
we all have a moment
in our lives when we wonder,

24:03.963 --> 24:04.962
"What if?"

24:04.998 --> 24:08.966
What if I'd gone left
instead of right?

24:09.002 --> 24:10.535
What if I'd said yes
instead of no?

24:10.570 --> 24:12.704
What if I'd waited

24:12.739 --> 24:14.572
just five more minutes?

24:14.608 --> 24:15.740
What if?

24:15.776 --> 24:18.209
But how could
that change everything?

24:18.244 --> 24:22.947
Well, now and then,
somebody wonders so hard,

24:22.982 --> 24:26.518
that they turn it into a wish
without even knowing it.

24:26.553 --> 24:28.019
And trust me,

24:28.054 --> 24:29.654
a Christmas wish

24:29.690 --> 24:31.489
can be a very powerful thing.

24:32.559 --> 24:35.827
Okay, so, what am
I supposed to do now, hmm?

24:36.930 --> 24:38.996
My advice?

24:39.032 --> 24:40.632
Just go easy.

24:40.667 --> 24:41.700
One step at a time.

24:41.735 --> 24:43.835
It'll sort itself out.

24:43.870 --> 24:45.704
And how long
is that gonna take?

24:45.739 --> 24:46.705
Good question.

24:46.740 --> 24:49.073
Probably as long
as it takes for you

24:49.108 --> 24:50.875
to figure out why it happened
in the first place.

24:52.779 --> 24:54.979
[ringing bell]

24:55.014 --> 24:56.614
That's great, thanks.

25:00.887 --> 25:05.623
[GPS]: <i> In 50 yards,
take a left on Smith Street.</i>

25:11.931 --> 25:16.000
[♪♪♪]

25:27.714 --> 25:28.680
Please keep walking.

25:28.715 --> 25:30.815
Just keep
walking...

25:30.851 --> 25:31.949
Just keep walking...

25:36.055 --> 25:37.021
Hanna!

25:37.056 --> 25:38.022
[knocking] Hanna!

25:38.057 --> 25:39.023
Hey!

25:39.058 --> 25:41.192
I was gonna call you
when I got home.

25:41.227 --> 25:42.226
[knocking]

25:43.296 --> 25:44.328
Door's locked.

25:45.965 --> 25:47.599
[unlocks]

25:48.902 --> 25:50.902
[gasping]

25:50.937 --> 25:52.604
Time for a cool-down anyway.

25:52.639 --> 25:54.572
I'm up to three miles a day,
can you believe it?

25:54.608 --> 25:55.573
Oh.

25:55.609 --> 25:57.709
I mean, it's killing me,
but it's worth it.

25:57.744 --> 25:58.710
And like you said,

25:58.745 --> 26:00.812
it's not a sprint,
it's a marathon.

26:00.847 --> 26:03.080
What are you
doing out here?

26:03.116 --> 26:05.249
Oh. You know.

26:05.285 --> 26:06.851
Yeah, I know.

26:06.887 --> 26:09.587
This time of year,
it never stops.

26:09.623 --> 26:10.889
You need to take
a little down-time.

26:10.924 --> 26:12.757
I'm just surprised, you know.

26:12.793 --> 26:13.792
I mean, with tonight
and everything?

26:13.827 --> 26:14.793
Tonight?

26:14.828 --> 26:15.927
Well, that's why
I was gonna call you.

26:15.962 --> 26:17.962
I was planning to make
my sweet potato pie,

26:17.997 --> 26:19.030
like I do every year.

26:19.065 --> 26:20.698
Suddenly, Rob's like,

26:20.734 --> 26:22.901
"Tammy, make something else
for a change."

26:22.936 --> 26:25.202
And I was wondering,
what do you think?

26:25.238 --> 26:27.705
Do you think everyone's sick
of the same old thing?

26:29.075 --> 26:30.241
Because we're friends.

26:30.276 --> 26:31.242
Tammy.

26:31.277 --> 26:32.944
Right?
That's why you're asking?

26:32.979 --> 26:36.247
Well, yeah.

26:36.282 --> 26:38.015
Because you come to me,
and I can come to you...

26:40.253 --> 26:41.218
So you think Rob's right?

26:41.254 --> 26:44.856
No, no,
I'm just saying,

26:44.891 --> 26:46.023
that after
all these years,

26:46.059 --> 26:48.326
we can talk
about anything.

26:48.361 --> 26:49.661
Well, I guess.

26:49.696 --> 26:51.028
Sure.

26:51.064 --> 26:54.365
We talk about how
you're married to... Rob?

26:54.400 --> 26:56.200
And how I'm...

26:56.235 --> 26:58.369
I'm married to Ben.

26:58.404 --> 27:02.273
And live in this house
with two daughters.

27:02.308 --> 27:04.375
Aw, Caitlin and Hallie
are such great girls.

27:04.410 --> 27:05.743
Caitlin and Hallie--

27:05.779 --> 27:07.078
yes, they are great kids.

27:07.113 --> 27:08.913
They're wonderful kids,
Caitlin and Hallie,

27:08.949 --> 27:09.914
they're wonderful kids,

27:09.950 --> 27:10.949
with names that just
really stick with you

27:10.984 --> 27:12.116
when you say them enough.

27:12.151 --> 27:13.918
[muttering] Caitlin and Hallie.
Caitlin and Hallie...

27:13.954 --> 27:15.152
You know what,
and then there's my job?

27:15.188 --> 27:17.054
When did you get a job?

27:17.090 --> 27:18.623
Not a job!

27:18.658 --> 27:19.657
Not a job-job.

27:19.693 --> 27:21.860
Just I'm...
I'm a stay-at-home mom.

27:21.895 --> 27:23.060
My family is my job?

27:23.096 --> 27:24.863
Yeah, like you'd have time
for anything else,

27:24.898 --> 27:27.264
with the PTA,
and the booster club,

27:27.300 --> 27:28.933
and the neighborhood watch,

27:28.969 --> 27:31.903
and running after the girls
every which way.

27:31.938 --> 27:33.204
I don't know
how you keep up as it is.

27:33.239 --> 27:35.807
Really makes you wonder
how I got here.

27:36.810 --> 27:39.210
Honey, are you okay?

27:39.245 --> 27:42.346
Um... I'm just kind of
having an off day.

27:42.382 --> 27:44.115
Huh, well, I read somewhere

27:44.150 --> 27:45.116
almost half the people
in this country

27:45.151 --> 27:46.117
dread the holidays.

27:46.152 --> 27:49.186
That is the least
of my problems.

27:49.222 --> 27:50.321
[sighs]

27:50.356 --> 27:53.391
Is everything
okay at home?

27:53.426 --> 27:55.192
I'm not sure.

27:56.229 --> 27:57.795
Did you and Ben have a fight?

27:59.766 --> 28:01.766
No, I never
had a fight with Ben.

28:01.801 --> 28:03.234
That's what I mean,
if you two can't get along,

28:03.269 --> 28:04.936
what hope is there
for the rest of us?

28:04.971 --> 28:09.040
But sometimes, people change.

28:09.075 --> 28:10.174
Not you two.

28:10.209 --> 28:12.677
[alarm beeps]
Oh, I gotta scoot.

28:12.712 --> 28:13.811
See you tonight.

28:14.948 --> 28:16.113
Tammy, um,

28:16.149 --> 28:18.315
why are you bringing
sweet potato pie?

28:20.319 --> 28:22.119
You know what?

28:22.155 --> 28:23.421
You're right.

28:23.456 --> 28:26.891
It is time for a change.

28:26.927 --> 28:28.392
Thanks, Hanna.

28:34.333 --> 28:35.733
[sighs]

28:38.929 --> 28:42.931
[Ben]: No. No, she hasn't
been gone that long.

28:42.966 --> 28:44.399
I was just wondering if she--

28:44.434 --> 28:46.101
maybe she went over
to your place

28:46.136 --> 28:48.403
to work on the pageant
or something.

28:48.438 --> 28:50.906
No, no, I'm sure she's fine.

28:52.876 --> 28:54.009
Hi.

28:54.044 --> 28:55.410
Hi.

28:55.445 --> 28:56.611
Never mind.
She's here.

28:56.646 --> 28:58.180
Thanks.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.020
You look great,
by the way.

29:05.055 --> 29:06.521
Are you all right?

29:07.925 --> 29:10.025
You know,
I've had better days.

29:10.060 --> 29:11.860
You left without
your phone and your purse.

29:11.895 --> 29:13.195
I had no idea where you were.

29:13.230 --> 29:14.495
And the way
you ran out of here...

29:14.531 --> 29:16.331
Yeah, sorry about that.

29:16.366 --> 29:17.999
I've been
calling everybody.

29:18.035 --> 29:19.334
What's going on?
Where've you been?

29:19.369 --> 29:22.037
I went into the city.

29:22.072 --> 29:23.238
The city?

29:23.273 --> 29:25.540
That's where I live.

29:25.575 --> 29:27.142
Come on, Hanna,
this isn't funny.

29:27.177 --> 29:28.176
I was really worried.

29:28.212 --> 29:30.045
How do you think I feel?

29:30.080 --> 29:32.114
I went to bed,

29:32.149 --> 29:33.148
and the next thing I know,

29:33.183 --> 29:35.483
I wake up in the suburbs--

29:35.518 --> 29:37.119
with two kids and a dog?

29:38.122 --> 29:39.888
Whoa, what are you
talking about?

29:39.923 --> 29:41.189
We talked about this
when we got married,

29:41.225 --> 29:43.058
and I got the job offer
in San Francisco.

29:43.093 --> 29:44.059
We decided to move here,

29:44.094 --> 29:45.927
and raise our family.

29:45.963 --> 29:47.528
And I, for one, have been
very happy

29:47.564 --> 29:48.563
over the last 10 years.

29:50.167 --> 29:51.266
Wow.

29:51.301 --> 29:54.202
Um, okay, I don't even know
how to say this, Ben,

29:54.238 --> 29:55.203
but there's really been

29:55.239 --> 29:57.505
some sort of, like,
cosmic mash-up.

29:57.540 --> 29:58.506
I didn't wish for this.

29:58.541 --> 30:00.608
I know it's not exactly
what we planned--

30:00.644 --> 30:03.245
Ben, that's what
I'm trying to tell you.

30:03.280 --> 30:06.347
I am not your wife,
and this is not my house,

30:06.383 --> 30:08.116
and I am not anybody's "Mommy."

30:08.152 --> 30:10.718
But they seem like
nice kids.

30:14.091 --> 30:17.192
Look, I don't know
where this is coming from,

30:17.227 --> 30:19.661
but, you and me,
we could always talk.

30:19.696 --> 30:22.998
When you're ready to tell me
what's really going on,

30:23.033 --> 30:24.132
we'll figure it out.

30:26.970 --> 30:27.969
Okay.

30:34.377 --> 30:37.545
You look like
I haven't kissed you in years.

30:40.117 --> 30:41.449
Can I take a shower?

30:41.484 --> 30:44.152
You don't need
permission.

30:44.188 --> 30:45.153
Right.

30:45.189 --> 30:46.621
Of course, because I...

30:46.656 --> 30:49.557
Yeah, I live here.

31:02.105 --> 31:03.305
[sighs]

31:04.341 --> 31:08.210
This is Hanna Dunbar reporting.
Channel 8 news.

31:08.245 --> 31:09.211
Don't--

31:09.246 --> 31:10.312
What are you--
What are you doing?

31:10.347 --> 31:11.679
I was just getting
a Band-aid for Hallie.

31:11.715 --> 31:12.747
What are you doing?

31:12.782 --> 31:14.515
Since when are you so shy?

31:15.685 --> 31:16.651
I'm not shy,

31:16.686 --> 31:19.287
just a little "me" time
would be nice.

31:19.323 --> 31:20.288
"Me Time."

31:20.324 --> 31:21.789
I remember that, back
before we had kids.

31:24.094 --> 31:25.493
Do you need
anything from the store?

31:25.528 --> 31:26.561
You're leaving?

31:26.596 --> 31:28.730
Yeah, we need ice
for the party.

31:28.765 --> 31:30.332
Party?

31:30.367 --> 31:32.734
Oh, no, no,
I can't go to a party.

31:32.769 --> 31:35.170
Then I guess it's a good thing
we're having it here.

31:35.205 --> 31:37.438
Don't forget
about the mushrooms.

31:37.474 --> 31:39.341
[chuckles awkwardly]

31:39.376 --> 31:41.376
Mushrooms?

31:42.412 --> 31:44.312
Mushrooms...

32:02.266 --> 32:03.631
[tapping thoughtfully]

32:09.172 --> 32:10.372
Ah-hah.

32:23.586 --> 32:25.787
Mushrooms.

32:35.732 --> 32:37.432
Thank you...

32:37.467 --> 32:38.766
Caitlin.

32:44.374 --> 32:47.242
Wow, we certainly do
a lot of cooking.

32:48.578 --> 32:50.111
Ooh, look at this.

32:50.147 --> 32:51.546
"Mushrooms Neptune."

32:51.581 --> 32:54.682
And would you just look
at all those ingredients.

32:54.717 --> 32:57.752
This looks so...
so complicated.

32:57.787 --> 32:58.786
It's Daddy's
favorite.

32:58.822 --> 33:00.155
I know.

33:06.296 --> 33:08.330
Do you know what would
really surprise Daddy?

33:12.702 --> 33:15.837
Hi, guys, I'm back.

33:20.143 --> 33:21.709
Do I smell mushrooms?

33:21.744 --> 33:23.778
Surprise!

33:23.813 --> 33:25.113
They wanted
to make it themselves.

33:25.148 --> 33:26.181
[giggling]

33:26.216 --> 33:27.349
Yum. Now, who's
going to clean this mess up?

33:27.384 --> 33:28.383
[Together]: You.

33:29.386 --> 33:31.319
[♪♪♪]

33:31.355 --> 33:33.488
[hum of conversation]

33:40.163 --> 33:42.297
Hi.

33:44.434 --> 33:45.533
Hi.

33:50.173 --> 33:51.706
Merry Christmas.

34:00.417 --> 34:01.883
Hanna, did you see
that e-mail

34:01.918 --> 34:03.485
that Caitlin's
coach sent out?

34:03.520 --> 34:06.321
Oh, yeah...

34:06.356 --> 34:08.255
Next season,
he wants the girls

34:08.291 --> 34:09.257
to try out
for their positions.

34:09.292 --> 34:10.591
To have the best
starting line-up.

34:10.627 --> 34:11.626
So they can
win a few games?

34:11.661 --> 34:13.594
Beats losing.

34:14.630 --> 34:15.630
Our girls aren't
there to win.

34:15.665 --> 34:17.165
They just
want to have fun.

34:17.199 --> 34:18.400
And competing
against your friends?

34:18.435 --> 34:20.168
I think that sends the wrong
message to the girls,

34:20.203 --> 34:21.202
don't you?

34:21.237 --> 34:23.204
No, I think he has a point.

34:23.239 --> 34:24.472
What?

34:24.507 --> 34:26.341
You know what it's
like out there.

34:26.376 --> 34:28.643
Everybody scrambling around
to get their piece of the pie.

34:28.678 --> 34:29.643
A little competition
at their age--

34:29.679 --> 34:30.811
I don't think
that's a bad thing.

34:34.351 --> 34:36.918
But... they just look so cute

34:36.953 --> 34:39.487
in those little uniforms,
don't they?

34:39.523 --> 34:40.955
So adorable.

34:40.989 --> 34:42.190
[doorbell rings]

34:42.225 --> 34:43.558
Excuse me.

34:45.262 --> 34:46.627
Oh, Tammy!

34:46.663 --> 34:47.728
Look who's here.

34:47.764 --> 34:49.431
Everybody, Tammy's here.

34:49.466 --> 34:50.931
No running
in the house.

34:50.967 --> 34:52.233
Sorry we're late.

34:52.268 --> 34:54.436
Don't try a new recipe
when you're in a hurry.

34:54.471 --> 34:55.437
No, no, it's okay.

34:55.472 --> 34:56.871
I'm just so happy to see
a familiar face.

34:56.906 --> 34:57.872
You must be Rob.

34:57.907 --> 34:58.873
[laughs]

34:58.908 --> 34:59.874
Has it been that long?

34:59.909 --> 35:01.242
Hey, Hanna.

35:01.278 --> 35:02.343
Where's Ben?

35:02.379 --> 35:03.911
Uh, he's
in the kitchen with...

35:03.947 --> 35:06.647
those people that are
in the kitchen.

35:07.984 --> 35:09.384
So, what
do you think?

35:09.419 --> 35:10.385
That looks great.

35:10.420 --> 35:14.456
[♪♪♪]

35:23.800 --> 35:24.799
[chuckling]

35:24.834 --> 35:25.800
I mean, the guy
owns the company,

35:25.835 --> 35:27.469
he's paying me to come up
with an ad campaign

35:27.504 --> 35:28.836
to sell more hot tubs.

35:28.871 --> 35:30.305
The thing is,

35:30.340 --> 35:32.240
not only does he want to
be his own spokesman--

35:32.275 --> 35:33.374
You write advertising.

35:34.578 --> 35:36.578
That's what
I keep telling myself.

35:36.613 --> 35:38.379
Nine years,
I've been doing this.

35:38.415 --> 35:39.481
Nine years.

35:39.516 --> 35:40.515
Wow.

35:42.586 --> 35:43.551
So, uh, anyway,

35:43.587 --> 35:47.255
I called the guy,
I said, listen...

35:47.290 --> 35:49.557
I mean, this job is the whole
reason we moved here.

36:16.786 --> 36:17.752
Be right back.

36:17.787 --> 36:18.753
You're leaving?

36:18.788 --> 36:19.754
He's smart,

36:19.789 --> 36:21.456
but he hasn't learned
to walk himself.

36:21.491 --> 36:23.424
Come on.
Come on, Toby.

36:23.460 --> 36:26.327
Come on, let's go.
Good job.

36:37.073 --> 36:38.640
[sighs heavily]

36:38.675 --> 36:41.108
So, this is
how it's gonna be?

36:42.612 --> 36:44.812
Then you just
have to figure it out.

36:47.584 --> 36:48.983
That's what he said, right?

36:49.018 --> 36:51.786
Figure out why it happened
in the first place,

36:51.821 --> 36:54.889
before you can
change anything back.

36:54.924 --> 36:57.625
I can do this.

37:00.463 --> 37:01.829
I hope.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.833
[sighs nervously]

37:46.143 --> 37:47.209
[sighs]

37:54.384 --> 37:56.652
[sighing]

38:06.697 --> 38:08.731
What?

38:08.766 --> 38:10.666
You left in the things.

38:10.701 --> 38:13.002
What things?

38:15.106 --> 38:16.705
Well, if you don't like
the fruit,

38:16.741 --> 38:17.873
why did you pick the cereal?

38:17.908 --> 38:19.374
I like the cereal.

38:19.409 --> 38:21.110
I like the fruit.

38:21.145 --> 38:24.046
So, you like the fruit
but not the cereal,

38:24.081 --> 38:27.415
and you like the cereal
but not the fruit?

38:27.451 --> 38:28.684
Are you guys
messing with me?

38:29.687 --> 38:31.153
Morning.

38:32.456 --> 38:34.657
You left in the things?

38:34.692 --> 38:35.691
I lost my head.

38:40.364 --> 38:42.865
I will see
everybody tonight.

38:42.900 --> 38:43.999
Wait, you're leaving?

38:44.035 --> 38:45.000
I know it's early,

38:45.036 --> 38:46.135
but I'm supposed to have
a breakfast meeting

38:46.170 --> 38:47.302
with those
drugstore guys.

38:47.337 --> 38:49.204
Could be
a big account for us.

38:50.474 --> 38:51.874
I'll call you later.

38:52.877 --> 38:53.842
You guys,

38:53.878 --> 38:55.177
have a great day
at school, okay?

38:55.212 --> 38:56.145
Okay.

38:56.180 --> 38:57.179
Bye.

38:57.214 --> 38:58.213
Bye!

39:00.117 --> 39:01.817
[muttering] School...

39:01.852 --> 39:03.451
I mean, how hard could it be
to figure out her password?

39:03.487 --> 39:05.054
Oh. Oh, hi.
Hi there.

39:05.089 --> 39:06.055
Okay, great,

39:06.090 --> 39:07.222
all set.

39:07.257 --> 39:09.124
Um, listen, do you guys
happen to know

39:09.160 --> 39:12.427
if I keep the school's address
on my phone?

39:12.462 --> 39:13.762
Why are you
acting so weird?

39:13.798 --> 39:16.198
Weird? What?

39:16.233 --> 39:18.466
Are you okay?

39:19.870 --> 39:20.969
Oh, yeah, no, yes.

39:21.005 --> 39:22.437
No, I'm fine.

39:22.472 --> 39:26.175
I'm just a little...
not myself these days.

39:26.210 --> 39:28.043
My teacher says Christmas
does that to people.

39:28.079 --> 39:30.179
Christmas.
Exactly.

39:30.214 --> 39:32.147
Christmas.

39:32.183 --> 39:34.216
It's the most wonderful time
of the year, but...

39:34.251 --> 39:36.351
but it definitely
does that to people.

39:36.386 --> 39:38.420
So, are you
gonna be okay?

39:39.857 --> 39:40.823
Absolutely,

39:40.858 --> 39:43.358
and I don't want
you guys to worry,

39:43.393 --> 39:44.359
okay?

39:44.394 --> 39:46.028
'Cause this is
strictly temporary,

39:46.063 --> 39:47.429
and as soon as I get
to the bottom of it,

39:47.464 --> 39:48.931
everything goes back
to the way it was.

39:49.934 --> 39:51.333
In the meantime,
though,

39:51.368 --> 39:52.801
you two can help me.

39:52.837 --> 39:54.269
What do you mean?

39:54.304 --> 39:55.871
I mean, you can help
keep me on the ball.

39:55.906 --> 39:58.006
Keep me focused.

39:58.042 --> 39:59.808
You know, help
remind me of stuff

39:59.844 --> 40:02.310
if I get too weird
or distracted,

40:02.346 --> 40:05.114
or, I don't know, lost?

40:05.149 --> 40:08.450
So you can think more
about Christmas?

40:08.485 --> 40:09.451
Exactly.

40:09.486 --> 40:11.220
Yes, you handle the details,

40:11.255 --> 40:13.521
and I'll think about Christmas.

40:13.557 --> 40:14.790
How does that sound?

40:17.427 --> 40:19.361
We know how to
get to school.

40:19.396 --> 40:20.395
Have you guys ever noticed

40:20.430 --> 40:22.898
how all the streets
look the same?

40:24.001 --> 40:25.000
Turn here.

40:26.070 --> 40:27.269
See, that was a test,

40:27.304 --> 40:28.871
and... that was good.

40:28.906 --> 40:33.142
Now, who remembers
what we do after school?

40:33.177 --> 40:34.276
You have to pick us up
right after school

40:34.311 --> 40:35.510
or I'll be late
for ballet.

40:35.545 --> 40:37.112
Then you take Hallie
to gymnastics.

40:37.148 --> 40:38.113
Don't forget
to bring us a snack.

40:38.149 --> 40:40.883
Okay, so ballet,
gymnastics, snack, got it.

40:40.918 --> 40:41.917
You have to
make something

40:41.952 --> 40:43.285
for our class
Christmas parties, too.

40:43.320 --> 40:45.053
What, like stuffed mushrooms?

40:45.089 --> 40:46.321
[giggling]

40:46.356 --> 40:48.056
No. Cookies.

40:51.996 --> 40:52.961
We saw a raccoon!

40:52.997 --> 40:54.997
Okay, honey,
that's a little off-topic.

40:55.032 --> 40:56.464
No, she means
that's where you turn.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.566
Where you saw a raccoon
is where you turn? What?

40:58.602 --> 41:00.202
Yeah, here.

41:00.237 --> 41:01.270
Just, uh...

41:01.305 --> 41:03.371
a little more heads-up
next time, okay?

41:03.407 --> 41:04.940
You have to
pick me up first,

41:04.975 --> 41:06.008
then you go back
for Hallie.

41:06.043 --> 41:08.877
We usually have dinner
right when Dad gets home.

41:08.913 --> 41:10.045
Dinner. Okay.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.047
And we still need to help
get ready for the pageant.

41:12.082 --> 41:13.115
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, pageant?

41:13.150 --> 41:14.516
There it is.

41:29.366 --> 41:31.466
There you go.

41:31.501 --> 41:33.235
Got your backpack...

41:35.472 --> 41:37.572
All right, well, group hug?

41:37.607 --> 41:39.074
Okay? Yeah?

41:40.311 --> 41:42.410
Okay, you guys have a great day.

41:42.446 --> 41:43.545
Okay. Bye.

41:43.580 --> 41:44.612

Okay, come here, come here.

42:37.134 --> 42:39.334
Phew!
All right, listen to me,

42:39.370 --> 42:41.069
you've got five minutes, okay?

42:41.105 --> 42:42.170
Deal?

42:43.407 --> 42:45.640
[sighing]

42:48.612 --> 42:52.281
I mean, technically, it's mine.

42:54.651 --> 42:56.618

42:56.653 --> 42:58.120

Wow, you have got to
get out more.

43:19.576 --> 43:21.310
[sighing fondly]

43:27.318 --> 43:28.716
Oh, you don't know
where that's been.

43:28.752 --> 43:30.052
Put that down,
and not on me.

43:30.087 --> 43:31.153
That is disgusting.

43:31.188 --> 43:32.687
Oh...

43:32.722 --> 43:34.957
Ew.

43:34.992 --> 43:36.724
What a sweetie.

43:36.760 --> 43:38.526
You just want to play,
don't you, boy?

43:38.562 --> 43:39.527
Yeah...

43:39.563 --> 43:40.528
Aw, what's his name?

43:40.564 --> 43:41.997
Hmm?

43:42.032 --> 43:43.031
His name,

43:43.067 --> 43:44.433
what do you call him?

43:44.468 --> 43:46.134
Yeah. Oh, I was just,
you know...

43:46.170 --> 43:47.169
We just...

43:47.204 --> 43:49.204
He does have a name?

43:49.239 --> 43:50.238
Of course.

43:50.274 --> 43:51.473
Of course, he has a name.

43:51.508 --> 43:52.574
I mean, why wouldn't he
have a name?

43:52.609 --> 43:54.609
[laughing]
That would just be crazy.

43:54.644 --> 43:57.479
I mean,
who wouldn't name their dog?

43:57.514 --> 43:58.713
Um... you know.

43:58.748 --> 44:00.148
Uh, what would you call him,

44:00.184 --> 44:01.984
if you didn't
name your dog?

44:02.019 --> 44:02.985
It would just be,
like, "Dog."

44:03.020 --> 44:03.986
"Hey, Dog!" Dog...

44:04.021 --> 44:05.420
Oh! Toby!

44:05.456 --> 44:06.654
Toby!

44:06.690 --> 44:08.256
Your name is Toby.
His name's Toby.

44:08.292 --> 44:10.092
We call him Toby, yeah.

44:10.127 --> 44:11.994
Just Toby, Toby, Toby.

44:12.029 --> 44:13.761
Gold old Toby, that's right.

44:13.797 --> 44:15.563
[chuckling awkwardly]

44:15.599 --> 44:17.199
We are not taking
that ball home,

44:17.234 --> 44:18.200
that is disgusting.

44:18.235 --> 44:20.235
Clearly, Toby, we have
to be more careful

44:20.270 --> 44:21.536
around the Christmas tree

44:21.571 --> 44:22.637
so it doesn't tip over.

44:22.672 --> 44:25.773
So I suggest
we wipe the slate clean

44:25.809 --> 44:26.774
and start over.

44:26.810 --> 44:28.143
Does that sound good to you?

44:28.178 --> 44:29.177
[barks]

44:37.488 --> 44:39.687
Was that so hard?

I'm really
sorry, you guys.

46:48.242 --> 46:49.308
I lost track of time,

46:49.343 --> 46:50.342
and then
I couldn't find the place

46:50.378 --> 46:51.377
where we saw the raccoon,

46:51.412 --> 46:52.578
so I didn't know where to turn.

46:52.613 --> 46:55.747
Whoever's late for ballet
has to be last in line.

46:55.783 --> 46:56.815
That seems harsh.

46:56.850 --> 46:59.351
I promise,
it won't happen again, okay?

46:59.387 --> 47:01.487
Oh, and
the good news is,

47:01.522 --> 47:04.323
I got all kinds of cookies
for your class party.

47:04.358 --> 47:05.658
At the store?

47:05.693 --> 47:07.159
Well, I didn't know

47:07.195 --> 47:08.160
what kind your class likes,

47:08.196 --> 47:09.495
so I got a little bit
of everything.

to bake cookies.

47:39.727 --> 47:42.394
Everything okay?

47:42.430 --> 47:44.597
We had kind of a rocky day.

47:44.632 --> 47:46.599
Ah, that explains
the pizza.

47:46.634 --> 47:47.733
What?

47:47.768 --> 47:49.101
Since we only have pizza

47:49.136 --> 47:50.536
on birthdays
and family movie nights,

47:50.571 --> 47:51.870
I figured something was up.

47:55.610 --> 47:56.609
How was, uh, your day?

47:56.644 --> 47:58.310
Not bad.

47:59.513 --> 48:00.846
What?

48:01.915 --> 48:02.914
We got
the drugstore account.

48:03.917 --> 48:06.184
Oh, good.

48:07.388 --> 48:09.755
Yeah, that was pretty much
the consensus at the office.

48:09.790 --> 48:11.357
Landing our
biggest account ever

48:11.392 --> 48:13.825
is definitely a step
in the right direction.

48:13.861 --> 48:15.193
I'm sorry, that's...

48:15.229 --> 48:16.762

Yeah, I do.

I mean, it's a small shop,
but we're getting there.

48:28.676 --> 48:30.175
You know what
I was thinking about today?

48:31.612 --> 48:32.645
Your novel.

48:33.881 --> 48:34.846
What?

48:34.882 --> 48:38.450
You're such
a talented writer, Ben.

48:41.722 --> 48:43.555
I was just thinking about it.

48:43.591 --> 48:44.757
Um... I'm sorry.

48:44.792 --> 48:46.325
No, you're right,
one of these days.

48:46.360 --> 48:47.393
Definitely.

48:50.531 --> 48:51.830
Yeah.

I'm gonna go
check on the girls.

- Hey.
- Morning.

Is that oatmeal?

49:46.787 --> 49:47.986
Just the way you like it.

49:48.021 --> 49:50.922
I haven't had that
since college.

49:50.958 --> 49:53.959
Well, it's
still good for you.

49:55.896 --> 49:57.295
Hmm.

49:57.331 --> 49:58.330
Thanks.

49:58.366 --> 50:00.699
Mm, I gotta go.

50:00.735 --> 50:01.867
I'm sorry.

50:01.902 --> 50:03.935
That's all right,
no problem.

50:08.442 --> 50:09.441
Have a great day
at school, guys.

50:09.477 --> 50:10.509
Okay.

50:10.544 --> 50:11.510
See you tonight, okay?

50:11.545 --> 50:12.811
Bye!

50:15.716 --> 50:16.715

50:19.854 --> 50:21.587
Do you want to have lunch?

50:21.622 --> 50:22.888
What?

50:22.923 --> 50:23.889
You know, lunch.

50:23.924 --> 50:25.657
We used to do it
all the time.

50:25.693 --> 50:27.325
We also used to
have the time.

50:27.361 --> 50:28.360
What's going on?

50:29.397 --> 50:30.662
I just feel like
I haven't talked to you in

50:30.698 --> 50:31.730
a really long time.

50:31.766 --> 50:32.931
Sure.

50:32.966 --> 50:34.700
Swing by the office.
We'll grab a sandwich.

50:41.642 --> 50:42.674
Bye.

50:42.710 --> 50:44.009

50:49.349 --> 50:50.816
Okay, hop out.

50:54.688 --> 50:55.687

50:55.723 --> 50:56.855
are you going to give me
the silent treatment?

50:56.891 --> 50:58.824
How long are you gonna
keep acting like this?

50:58.859 --> 51:01.293
Come on, you guys, I'm trying.

51:01.328 --> 51:02.494
You have to
try harder.

51:02.530 --> 51:04.362
Being a mom is
an important job.

51:04.398 --> 51:05.697
What am I supposed to do?

gonna be late tonight,

51:10.438 --> 51:11.837

pick up the paint

51:11.872 --> 51:13.605

coming early and opening up?

51:15.743 --> 51:16.842
The Christmas
pageant?

51:16.877 --> 51:18.410
We need to
help decorate.

51:19.947 --> 51:21.547
How could you forget that?

51:21.582 --> 51:23.749
I've got a lot on my mind,
remember?

51:23.784 --> 51:25.651
You said that you would
think more about Christmas.

51:25.686 --> 51:26.652
That was the deal.

You know what,

51:28.456 --> 51:29.755
you're swamped.

51:29.790 --> 51:30.956

51:30.991 --> 51:33.058
See you soon.

51:33.093 --> 51:34.793
All right,
it's all taken care of. See?

You're really
not gonna help?

You guys, please,
give me a break.

about Christmas pageants.

51:46.874 --> 51:47.840
This isn't
even my real life.

51:47.875 --> 51:50.976
This is just a... a "what if."

51:51.011 --> 51:54.613
Yeah, strictly hypothetical
and temporary.

51:54.648 --> 51:55.781
I know the difference.

51:55.816 --> 51:57.950
If I can't tell
the difference. Please...

51:57.985 --> 52:01.019
I can feel the difference,
and it feels...

52:02.656 --> 52:04.623

What? You love
Christmas, Hanna.

54:04.878 --> 54:05.843
You always have.

54:05.879 --> 54:06.844
You can't wait

Is that what this whole lunch
is about?

54:22.329 --> 54:24.729
What? No.

54:24.764 --> 54:26.231
Because the last
few days,

54:26.266 --> 54:27.598
it's like
you haven't been yourself,

54:27.634 --> 54:29.134

a lot on my mind lately.

You're a great writer, Ben.

54:39.012 --> 54:40.678
Yeah, well, writing copy
may not be great literature,

54:40.713 --> 54:42.847
but at least
it pays the bills.

54:44.651 --> 54:48.119
But haven't you ever wondered
"what if"?

54:48.155 --> 54:49.654
What if you'd
kept writing?

54:49.689 --> 54:51.356
What if you'd
finished the book?

01:06:05.514 --> 01:06:07.815
to do something different
than anyone's tried before.

01:06:07.851 --> 01:06:09.116
Which is?

01:06:09.152 --> 01:06:11.052
To get that younger demographic
interested in the local news.

01:06:11.087 --> 01:06:12.954
[chuckling]

01:06:12.989 --> 01:06:14.155
Not in this lifetime.

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:15.422
No, not if we do it

01:06:15.458 --> 01:06:16.523
the same way
everyone else does,

01:06:16.559 --> 01:06:17.859
the same way we always did.

01:06:17.894 --> 01:06:19.026
"We"?

01:06:19.062 --> 01:06:21.462
Think of it as
a different side of the news.

01:06:21.497 --> 01:06:22.997
A better side.

01:06:23.032 --> 01:06:24.198
For 90 seconds
each night,

01:06:24.234 --> 01:06:26.734
people get to feel
better about themselves.

01:06:26.769 --> 01:06:28.002
And how
do we do that?

01:06:28.037 --> 01:06:30.171
You hire me

01:06:30.206 --> 01:06:31.472
as a Special
Correspondent.

01:06:31.507 --> 01:06:32.606
Okay...

01:06:32.641 --> 01:06:33.741
You use the mall video

01:06:33.776 --> 01:06:34.909
as a way to introduce
a new segment.

01:06:34.944 --> 01:06:37.144
We could call it,
I don't know, uh...

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:38.746
"You Gotta See This."

01:06:38.781 --> 01:06:39.847
And we get online,

01:06:39.883 --> 01:06:41.582
and we track the videos
that are popular,

01:06:41.617 --> 01:06:43.517
that have
that local connection,

01:06:43.552 --> 01:06:44.551
and we broadcast them,

01:06:44.587 --> 01:06:45.552
but it's not about the videos.

01:06:45.588 --> 01:06:47.855
Because we could
see those online anytime.

01:06:47.891 --> 01:06:48.923
Exactly.

01:06:48.958 --> 01:06:50.057
It's about the people.

01:06:50.093 --> 01:06:53.627
It's about the grandmas
and the kids,

01:06:53.662 --> 01:06:54.795
and the proud new parents,

01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:57.698
and all of the wonderful moments
that they want to share.

01:06:57.733 --> 01:06:59.666
It's about the lives they lead

01:06:59.702 --> 01:07:04.105
and how all of these same things
matter to all of us.

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:06.707
I know these people.

01:07:06.742 --> 01:07:08.776
They're my friends,
they're my neighbors,

01:07:08.811 --> 01:07:12.546
and I just never realized
before...

01:07:12.581 --> 01:07:15.016
I never realized
how important they are.

01:07:15.051 --> 01:07:17.018
How important family is.

01:07:17.053 --> 01:07:18.652
I mean, that's...

01:07:18.687 --> 01:07:20.587
That's what makes the world
a better place.

01:07:21.590 --> 01:07:24.591
Who wouldn't
want to watch that?

01:07:24.627 --> 01:07:26.560
Who wouldn't want to watch
a part of the news

01:07:26.595 --> 01:07:31.299
that just makes you
feel better about yourself?

01:07:35.838 --> 01:07:36.804
Hi! I'm home!

01:07:36.839 --> 01:07:38.272
In here.

01:07:38.308 --> 01:07:40.674
How'd it go?

01:07:40.709 --> 01:07:41.708
Great.

01:07:42.878 --> 01:07:44.912
Wow. Look at you.

01:07:44.948 --> 01:07:46.247
Thanks.

01:07:46.282 --> 01:07:47.781
I needed something
to wear to the city.

01:07:47.817 --> 01:07:49.116
That's something,
all right.

01:07:49.152 --> 01:07:50.584
[chuckles]

01:07:50.619 --> 01:07:51.852
Where are the girls?

01:07:51.887 --> 01:07:53.955
Dress rehearsal, remember?

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:55.656
Pageant's tomorrow night.

01:07:55.691 --> 01:07:56.991
I'm just taking them
some dinner.

01:07:57.026 --> 01:07:59.193
Well, I wanted to tell everyone
the big news together,

01:07:59.228 --> 01:08:00.527
but I can't wait.

01:08:00.563 --> 01:08:01.429
You got the interview?

01:08:01.464 --> 01:08:04.031
He offered m

01:08:04.067 --> 01:08:05.899
A job?

01:08:05.935 --> 01:08:07.034
[laughs]

01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:08.035
I mean, it's not official yet,

01:08:08.071 --> 01:08:09.903
because I still have to meet
with his boss.

01:08:09.939 --> 01:08:10.904
Whoa, whoa, Hanna.

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.407
A job in the city?

01:08:13.443 --> 01:08:14.475
You should've seen me, Ben.

01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:16.609
It was like, all of a sudden,
I could see it.

01:08:16.645 --> 01:08:17.711
It was just right there
in front of me,

01:08:17.746 --> 01:08:19.513
and all I had to do
was reach out and grab it.

01:08:19.548 --> 01:08:21.515
And I didn't let go
until he said yes.

01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:23.184
I was on fire.

01:08:23.219 --> 01:08:24.417
Wow, I...

01:08:24.453 --> 01:08:26.520
I've never heard you
sound like this before.

01:08:26.555 --> 01:08:28.555
I know, I'm so excited.
Isn't this exciting?

01:08:28.591 --> 01:08:29.555
Yeah.

01:08:29.591 --> 01:08:30.691
Yeah, no, I mean, it's great,

01:08:30.725 --> 01:08:32.559
but, um, don't you think
we need to talk about this?

01:08:32.595 --> 01:08:34.028
Oh, absolutely, of course.

01:08:34.063 --> 01:08:35.729
I know this is a lot
to take in at once.

01:08:35.764 --> 01:08:36.897
You could say that.

01:08:36.932 --> 01:08:38.099
I just have such
a good feeling

01:08:38.134 --> 01:08:39.133
about this job.

01:08:39.167 --> 01:08:40.134
I think this is a...

01:08:40.169 --> 01:08:42.236
It's like a whole
new beginning for us.

01:08:43.238 --> 01:08:45.572
I didn't know
we needed a new beginning.

01:08:46.575 --> 01:08:47.541
Oh, well, you know what I mean.

01:08:47.576 --> 01:08:48.675
And what about the girls?

01:08:48.711 --> 01:08:49.743
What do you mean?

01:08:49.778 --> 01:08:50.978
Working in the city,
with traffic,

01:08:51.014 --> 01:08:52.479
it's over an hour each way.
When are you gonna see them?

01:08:52.515 --> 01:08:53.714
I'll see them all the time.

01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:54.747
You'll leave
before they wake up,

01:08:54.783 --> 01:08:56.117
get home after they're in bed.

01:08:56.152 --> 01:08:57.684
No, it's not
going to be like that,

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.220
and I'm going to be home
on the weekends.

01:08:59.255 --> 01:09:01.055
The weekends?

01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:02.555
You say something
like that, Hanna,

01:09:02.591 --> 01:09:04.691
and it's like
I don't even know you.

01:09:05.895 --> 01:09:08.095
You're right,
you're right, I'm sorry.

01:09:08.131 --> 01:09:09.130
It's-- Okay, fine,

01:09:09.165 --> 01:09:10.663
you know what,
I won't do the commute.

01:09:10.698 --> 01:09:12.698
I won't do the commute,
and we'll just, we'll move.

01:09:12.734 --> 01:09:14.768
Move? Wow.

01:09:14.803 --> 01:09:15.769
What? Why not?

01:09:15.804 --> 01:09:17.203
San Francisco is
an amazing city.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.506
I mean, there's so much
for the girls to see and do,

01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:20.573
and there's better schools,

01:09:20.609 --> 01:09:21.808
and there's
so many opportunities.

01:09:21.844 --> 01:09:22.809
Just like that?

01:09:22.845 --> 01:09:23.810
Take them
out of their school,

01:09:23.845 --> 01:09:24.944
ask them to leave
all their friends,

01:09:24.979 --> 01:09:26.880
say goodbye to the only home
they've ever known,

01:09:26.916 --> 01:09:28.782
the home where
we have become a family?

01:09:28.817 --> 01:09:30.850
And that sounds okay to you?

01:09:30.886 --> 01:09:33.254
We'll still be a family.

01:09:33.288 --> 01:09:34.522
This is...

01:09:34.557 --> 01:09:35.856
[chuckles in disbelief]

01:09:35.890 --> 01:09:38.125
This could be so great for us.

01:09:39.828 --> 01:09:41.194
It's already pretty great--

01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:42.996
or so I thought.

01:09:43.032 --> 01:09:45.166
The girls are
gonna be hungry.

01:09:57.185 --> 01:09:58.919
[chuckling fondly]

01:09:58.951 --> 01:10:00.050
Is that me?

01:10:00.085 --> 01:10:01.784
Yeah, on your first Christmas.

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:02.953
But not mine.

01:10:02.988 --> 01:10:03.954
No, you're right.

01:10:03.989 --> 01:10:06.990
It would've been
your third Christmas.

01:10:07.025 --> 01:10:09.592
Do you remember

01:10:09.627 --> 01:10:12.162
all the Christmases
we've ever had?

01:10:12.197 --> 01:10:16.900
I know I'll remember
this one best of all.

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:30.113
Oh...

01:10:30.148 --> 01:10:32.983
Look how cute.
[laughing]

01:10:35.087 --> 01:10:36.686
Oh, I love that one.

01:10:36.721 --> 01:10:37.720
Whoa.

01:10:37.756 --> 01:10:39.689
Look how tiny
you guys were.

01:10:39.724 --> 01:10:40.823
[giggling]

01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:46.429
They're asleep.

01:10:51.169 --> 01:10:52.402
[sighs heavily]

01:10:52.437 --> 01:10:54.037
I had this crazy idea

01:10:54.072 --> 01:10:56.239
that we'd raise our family
in this house,

01:10:56.275 --> 01:10:57.874
grow old together,

01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:59.409
share a lifetime
of memories.

01:10:59.444 --> 01:11:00.777
Ben...

01:11:00.812 --> 01:11:02.379
I love you, Hanna.

01:11:02.414 --> 01:11:04.180
Nothing's ever
gonna change that.

01:11:04.216 --> 01:11:06.182
And it's a lot
more important

01:11:06.218 --> 01:11:07.984
than the address
on our door.

01:11:09.988 --> 01:11:12.322
So if you need this...

01:11:13.358 --> 01:11:15.758
really need it,

01:11:15.794 --> 01:11:18.228
we'll figure out a way.

01:11:28.206 --> 01:11:30.974
[Caitlin]: How did you know
how to do that thing on TV?

01:11:31.009 --> 01:11:32.208
I was actually
a Broadcasting major

01:11:32.244 --> 01:11:33.776
in college.

01:11:33.812 --> 01:11:36.679
You know, I thought about
becoming a TV reporter.

01:11:36.714 --> 01:11:37.948
You would have been good.

01:11:39.284 --> 01:11:41.318
Aw, thanks.

01:11:41.353 --> 01:11:44.087
All right,
that should do it.

01:11:44.122 --> 01:11:45.121
Let's have a look.

01:11:46.158 --> 01:11:47.357
Okie dokie.

01:11:47.392 --> 01:11:48.858
Okay, everybody twirl.

01:11:50.762 --> 01:11:53.363
You call that twirling,
that's not twirling.

01:11:53.398 --> 01:11:55.098
Now, this...

01:11:55.133 --> 01:11:56.799
this is twirling.

01:11:56.835 --> 01:11:58.969
[giggling]

01:11:59.004 --> 01:12:00.403
And this is twirling!

01:12:00.439 --> 01:12:01.771
[laughing]

01:12:06.411 --> 01:12:08.778
[cell phone ringing]

01:12:08.813 --> 01:12:10.246

[♪♪♪]

01:13:11.943 --> 01:13:12.975
[whispering] Sorry.

01:13:14.546 --> 01:13:15.578
Hi.

01:13:16.881 --> 01:13:18.181
How did it go?

01:13:19.551 --> 01:13:22.785
I told him
I wasn't interested.

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:25.255
[♪♪♪]

01:13:32.397 --> 01:13:33.963
Did you like it?

01:13:33.998 --> 01:13:35.532
I loved it.

01:13:35.567 --> 01:13:37.833
Oh, you were both
so wonderful.

01:13:37.869 --> 01:13:39.402
I'm glad you came.

01:13:39.438 --> 01:13:40.937
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:43.506
Now go to sleep.

01:13:43.542 --> 01:13:44.507
I love you.

01:13:44.543 --> 01:13:46.576
I love you.

01:13:48.613 --> 01:13:51.614
I love you, too.

01:14:01.293 --> 01:14:03.593
Thank you.

01:14:12.971 --> 01:14:14.137
What?

01:14:17.142 --> 01:14:19.875
Let's remember this, okay?

01:14:21.546 --> 01:14:23.113
