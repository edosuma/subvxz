03:29.536 --> 03:31.244
Hey, Mornin', Roy!

03:37.168 --> 03:39.288
Same to you, asshole.

04:03.570 --> 04:07.519
Rudy Russo, mi amigo!
I bring you your cars.

04:07.699 --> 04:12.028
- They are beautiful, no?
- No! Are you using water-based paint?

04:12.245 --> 04:15.246
Sure, we don't get
much rain around here.

04:15.415 --> 04:18.250
What do you want
for 200? Metalflake?

04:18.418 --> 04:22.118
Listen, you don't like these cars...
here's my inventory.

04:22.297 --> 04:25.251
- That's a picture of 250 cars.
- 253 cars.

04:25.425 --> 04:28.592
The river has been very
good to me this year...

04:28.762 --> 04:31.965
I can't make a deal off
a picture like this.

04:32.140 --> 04:35.057
How about some girls?
I got all kinds!

04:35.226 --> 04:41.940
Short, tall, fat, uglies,
bonitas, señoritas, big tits...

04:42.108 --> 04:46.188
Later, I think I got a customer.
I'll think of something.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.600
Student driver shit!

05:29.781 --> 05:32.865
- Hey, Rudy!
- Quiet!

05:33.034 --> 05:36.403
- Jesus, you're not gonna...
- I'm gonna bait this guy.

05:36.579 --> 05:39.826
- Luke's not gonna like that.
- Luke's asleep.

05:46.131 --> 05:49.464
- Who's the grape?
- Right there, see him?

05:49.634 --> 05:54.794
He pulled up in that red Chevelle.
I'm gonna sell him my Buick.

05:54.973 --> 05:58.887
- Forget it. He pulled up in a red car.
- Come on, Jeff, you got your foot.

05:59.060 --> 06:03.224
A rabbit's foot is no
protection against a red car.

06:03.398 --> 06:05.770
A red car is bad luck and trouble.

06:05.942 --> 06:10.106
I gotta get some customers on this lot.
I gotta have some fast cash.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.818
Yeah? For what?

06:15.326 --> 06:17.403
For this.

06:19.873 --> 06:22.827
Christ, first a red car,
now this...

06:43.813 --> 06:49.270
this man, Roy I. Fuchs, doesn't lie.
This man gives you a special guarantee.

06:49.444 --> 06:52.647
I mean, beautiful! It's up
to you, it's your decision.

06:52.822 --> 06:55.776
One who hesitates is lost.

06:55.950 --> 06:58.406
Where are you going, pal?
Come on back here!

07:09.547 --> 07:11.540
Hi there! How you doing?

07:13.510 --> 07:17.044
This your ten dollars? I saw it
floatin' underneath the car.

07:17.222 --> 07:20.721
- Here you are. What's your name?
- Stanley Dewoski.

07:20.892 --> 07:23.430
What a coincidence! Rudy Polanski.

07:23.603 --> 07:27.352
- I like that watch... great shoes!
- Thanks.

07:27.524 --> 07:31.438
So, you want to buy this Buick, huh?
You got good taste.

07:31.611 --> 07:36.107
Nice to see somebody on this lot who
knows a good car when he sees one.

07:36.282 --> 07:39.817
- So, we write it up?
- Actually, I was just looking.

07:39.994 --> 07:46.033
Hey, terrific! Here you can look, browse,
taste, smell, do anything you want.

07:46.209 --> 07:49.329
Nobody's gonna pressure
anybody around here.

07:49.504 --> 07:52.375
I really think you ought
to buy this Buick.

07:52.549 --> 07:55.965
You ought to buy it right now.
This Buick is you.

07:56.136 --> 08:01.094
This is your car! Stanley Dewoski
is Buick centurion convertible.

08:01.266 --> 08:05.014
You're thinking, "can I afford
to buy a car like this?"

08:05.186 --> 08:07.973
You can't afford not to
buy a car like this.

08:08.148 --> 08:13.355
When you add this whole thing up,
you'll come out 10,000 dollars ahead.

08:13.528 --> 08:18.024
The prestige of owning a Buick centurion
can't be measured in dollars and cents.

08:18.199 --> 08:21.236
What the hell are you
trying to tell me, Sam?

08:21.411 --> 08:27.864
I've been trying to make sure that new
freeway ramp ran through my brother's lot.

08:28.043 --> 08:33.499
According to this, the Goddamn ramp is
coming right through the middle of my lot.

08:34.549 --> 08:36.707
What's with that pinhead mayor?

08:36.885 --> 08:41.926
He had no choice. It was the only way to
prove there was no conflict of interest.

08:42.097 --> 08:43.722
That mayor don't know dick!

08:43.892 --> 08:48.684
You're the assistant deputy district
attorney! Can't you fix it for me?

08:48.855 --> 08:53.434
- I'm sorry, Roy, it's too late.
- Just like that, huh?

08:53.610 --> 08:57.061
This country's going to the dogs!

08:57.238 --> 09:01.699
It used to be when you bought a politician,
that son of a bitch stayed bought.

09:02.744 --> 09:06.362
You're gonna love it, Stan!
Trust me!

09:08.208 --> 09:13.961
Shit! There goes a perfectly good
bumper sticker... hey, Luke.

09:14.130 --> 09:16.419
That's a nice pair of shoes.

09:16.591 --> 09:20.636
You baited him, didn't you?
Skated him from across the street.

09:20.804 --> 09:25.264
I had to. I can't sell a car
unless I get them on the lot.

09:25.433 --> 09:28.055
Now, Rudy, listen to me, will ya?

09:28.228 --> 09:31.312
For the last time,
will you listen to me, son?

09:31.481 --> 09:36.855
Suppose that he's an undercover agent
for the consumer protection agency.

09:37.028 --> 09:41.774
We're still on probation for consumer
fraud. We gotta watch our step.

09:41.950 --> 09:47.288
My ravenous brother over there is just
waiting to get his grimy hands on this lot.

09:47.497 --> 09:52.574
I'm desperate, I gotta move some cars.
I gotta make ten grand in six weeks.

09:52.752 --> 09:56.168
Ten grand? Are you in
some kind of trouble?

09:56.339 --> 09:59.340
No, no... take a look at this.

10:02.387 --> 10:05.304
There's an opening
for state senate.

10:05.473 --> 10:10.598
The machine's looking for a fresh face,
somebody with no axes to grind...

10:10.770 --> 10:15.479
who wants to tell the people what they
want to hear. They're looking for me!

10:15.650 --> 10:20.893
I talked to the party chairman last week.
Sixty grand buys me the nomination.

10:21.072 --> 10:24.856
Sixty grand, huh?
That's all it takes nowadays?

10:25.035 --> 10:27.323
No, that's like a down payment.

10:27.495 --> 10:32.204
Once I'm in, I go fifty-fifty on all
the graft I take in. Politics, Luke!

10:32.375 --> 10:37.962
It's my chance to do something with
my life. Go places, meet people...

10:38.131 --> 10:40.704
maybe even meet some broad...

10:42.052 --> 10:44.969
still looking, huh, Rudy?

10:45.138 --> 10:50.381
I don't want to be stuck on this
dusty lot for the rest of my life.

10:50.560 --> 10:55.851
I wanna make something out of myself,
have people look up at me for a change.

10:56.024 --> 10:58.431
This is my once in a lifetime deal.

10:58.610 --> 11:02.026
I took out a second
mortgage on my mobile home.

11:02.197 --> 11:07.322
I cashed in my insurance policies,
sold my car and I'm still ten grand short.

11:07.494 --> 11:10.495
Toby, get me a
phillip's screwdriver.

11:10.663 --> 11:17.461
Listen, I got some promotional ideas
that'll flood this place with prospects.

11:17.629 --> 11:20.167
I found two electronics whizz-kids.

11:20.340 --> 11:25.132
They know how to jam a football
game and sneak in some commercials.

11:25.303 --> 11:28.637
Now, we get these
strippers, big tits...

11:28.807 --> 11:32.341
you know, I think we'll put
this baby on the line...

11:32.519 --> 11:37.560
I can't fool with this forever.
Sixteen months is long enough.

11:38.858 --> 11:41.978
No, Toby, I said a
phillip's screwdriver.

11:42.153 --> 11:46.946
Luke, can I ask you something?
Why are we giving these cars away?

11:47.117 --> 11:51.743
We're not giving them away. School
district's paying me 1200 apiece.

11:51.913 --> 11:54.914
I can get 3950 apiece
for these cars.

11:55.125 --> 11:58.825
Those are the 1200 apiece cars.

11:59.003 --> 12:02.372
What? These?

12:02.549 --> 12:07.009
You are the craziest, most
irresponsible operator I ever met.

12:07.178 --> 12:12.173
And when you stand there and tell me
that you want to be a politician...

12:12.350 --> 12:16.679
I know you're right. All right,
I'll lend you the ten grand.

12:16.855 --> 12:18.563
No shit, Luke?

12:18.732 --> 12:21.898
I wouldn't kid you about
something like that.

12:22.068 --> 12:24.606
We'll go down to the
bank in the morning.

12:24.779 --> 12:30.450
Only I don't want to jam any football
games and I don't want any strippers.

12:30.618 --> 12:33.738
Goddam, all right, Luke! I love ya!

12:33.913 --> 12:35.823
I'm on my way!

12:35.999 --> 12:41.788
Ask not what your country's done for you,
ask what you've just done for your country!

12:41.963 --> 12:45.297
Are you okay?
Hey, are you all right, Luke?

12:45.508 --> 12:48.712
I'm just not used to all
that kind of excitement.

12:48.887 --> 12:53.181
Here... Jesus, I'm sorry, Luke.
Here, take a pill.

12:55.727 --> 13:00.519
I'll be all right. You
just promise me one thing.

13:00.690 --> 13:05.518
When you buy that election,
become a big-shot politician...

13:05.695 --> 13:10.191
promise me you'll keep my brother
from getting his hands on this lot.

13:10.367 --> 13:13.036
They know, don't they, Sam?

13:13.203 --> 13:19.158
They know they're about to have the
best freeway access in the state.

13:19.334 --> 13:23.332
Nobody knows, Roy. It won't be
announced for a few weeks yet.

13:23.505 --> 13:29.792
I suggest you torch this museum and buy out
your brother with the insurance money.

13:29.969 --> 13:36.387
If I could buy him out, do you think
I would try to have him put away?

13:36.559 --> 13:40.687
The only way I'm going to
get that lot is to inherit it.

13:40.855 --> 13:45.766
- I thought he had a daughter.
- She ain't been heard of in years.

13:45.944 --> 13:49.313
The son of a bitch has got
a bad heart, you know.

13:49.489 --> 13:52.158
Don't be stupid, Roy.

13:52.325 --> 13:57.320
- Just dreaming, Sam, just dreaming.
- Right...

14:08.049 --> 14:10.208
carmine!

14:10.385 --> 14:13.339
Send in that new kid from
the demolition derby.

14:13.513 --> 14:17.214
- Mickey?
- Yeah, mickey.

14:31.448 --> 14:36.156
Now, let's examine that pinto, shall we?
Look at that undercoating...

14:36.327 --> 14:39.661
- classic chassis, pal.
- Thanks.

14:39.831 --> 14:46.332
Shall we examine the capacious
interior of this luxury automobile?

14:49.591 --> 14:53.838
I got this guy right where
I want him. Stay out of this...

14:54.054 --> 14:58.265
Charlie, good to see you. I got the
papers drawn up on that Chrysler...

14:58.433 --> 15:02.383
- it's a Chevy Nova.
- Hey, I'll be right with you.

15:02.562 --> 15:05.100
Clown.

15:10.070 --> 15:13.189
Excuse me, old man, you a salesman?

15:30.340 --> 15:32.416
Now that's a miracle.

15:33.468 --> 15:36.552
God in heaven, that's a miracle.

15:36.721 --> 15:39.391
Excuse me, you a salesman here?

15:39.557 --> 15:45.263
You know, I'm not one for religion, but
jesus, Mary and Joseph that is a miracle!

15:45.438 --> 15:51.025
That was my daughter calling me.
Do you believe it? My own daughter.

15:51.194 --> 15:53.352
I just want to buy a car.

15:53.530 --> 15:57.444
She took off about ten years ago,
joined one of those communes.

15:57.617 --> 16:01.946
I ain't seen or heard from her.
Didn't know if she was living or dead.

16:02.122 --> 16:08.124
And all of a sudden she calls,
after ten years. Now that's a miracle.

16:08.294 --> 16:10.370
I know how you feel, old man.

16:10.547 --> 16:15.007
I had a dog once, ran away.
Only she got hit by a truck.

16:15.176 --> 16:21.511
What's the story on this '57 Chev here?
2400? Come on, you gotta be jacking me.

16:21.683 --> 16:26.760
Now, son, you're looking at one of
the finest automobiles on this lot.

16:26.938 --> 16:30.639
I rebuilt that engine
with my own two hands.

16:33.236 --> 16:35.442
Does it run?

16:35.613 --> 16:39.279
Does it run? Like a dream.

16:39.451 --> 16:45.287
Well, old man, for 2400 it'd
better run like a wet dream.

16:48.585 --> 16:52.001
Yeah... that's a miracle.

16:55.675 --> 16:59.424
Well, at least it starts, old man.

16:59.596 --> 17:01.884
After ten years...

17:02.932 --> 17:07.890
- you won't need that.
- I like to feel safe.

17:08.063 --> 17:11.063
Easy now, easy.

17:11.232 --> 17:14.185
Sounds good, old man!

17:19.907 --> 17:21.699
What the hell was that?

17:31.044 --> 17:36.548
You got a real oil pressure problem here,
it's running real hot... real hot.

17:41.262 --> 17:45.177
Pills? What do you need
those pills for, old man?

17:55.610 --> 17:58.183
Isn't this fun, old man?

18:02.283 --> 18:07.907
You ever played chicken?
I love chicken... I love it.

18:13.795 --> 18:16.464
You're a good sport,
old man. I like you.

18:16.631 --> 18:20.878
What do you say we find out what
this baby is constructed of?

18:24.723 --> 18:27.640
Come on, get over there, old man.

18:28.727 --> 18:30.137
Oh shit!

18:34.691 --> 18:38.024
What's the matter, old man?
You homesick?

18:43.616 --> 18:45.905
I'll have you home in a minute.

18:49.748 --> 18:51.123
What the hell was that?

18:56.713 --> 19:01.838
2400, old man? Well, I'm gonna have
to think about it. I got your card.

19:10.894 --> 19:14.898
- I broke my back getting you this deal.
- Fifty bucks never killed anybody.

19:14.899 --> 19:17.602
You're not going to find another
deal like this in town.

19:17.776 --> 19:21.608
- Fifty bucks never killed anybody.
- A deal's a deal.

19:21.780 --> 19:25.030
- Fifty bucks never...
- Okay, you got it, you win.

19:25.200 --> 19:29.328
I'll see what I can do. But I'm telling
ya, my boss sees these figures...

19:29.496 --> 19:32.781
when he sees these, he's
going to have a stroke.

19:32.957 --> 19:37.501
What's he trying to pull?
Fifty bucks never killed anybody.

19:43.468 --> 19:48.842
Okay, it's a deal, it's a deal!
I'll sign! I'll sign!

19:51.017 --> 19:53.935
I'm sorry! I shook on it!
It's a deal!

19:54.104 --> 19:58.433
I never welsh on a deal and
I really do want the car...

19:58.608 --> 20:00.186
Luke, where are your pills?

20:00.360 --> 20:05.354
Jesus Christ, you guys mean business!
I signed it! Show it to him!

20:05.532 --> 20:08.568
Here's the down payment.
Here, show it to him.

20:08.785 --> 20:12.201
Here's the money! Here, take it!

20:12.372 --> 20:15.955
Look... you guys are busy.
We'll pick the car up tomorrow.

20:16.126 --> 20:19.874
Oh my god! Honey,
let's get out of here!

21:19.564 --> 21:22.233
Jesus Christ!

21:22.400 --> 21:26.184
Luke's dead. Calm down,
we're being watched.

21:26.363 --> 21:31.274
- By who?
- Who do you think?

21:47.801 --> 21:52.546
Sam? Roy... Roy!
Yeah, I know it's late.

21:52.722 --> 21:57.301
First thing tomorrow, I want you to come
over here and visit my brother with me.

21:57.477 --> 22:01.724
Well, I'm a little concerned
about his health.

22:03.149 --> 22:06.814
And bring those probate
papers with you.

22:06.986 --> 22:08.778
Probate papers!

22:10.156 --> 22:12.113
He's gone.

22:12.283 --> 22:16.661
Jim, help me prop him up, I don't
want Toby to see him like this.

22:16.830 --> 22:21.990
Jesus, Mary and... I don't know, man.
I think we're out of our minds here.

22:22.168 --> 22:26.581
I think we've got to call the cops.
I mean, it's murder, for Christ's sake!

22:26.756 --> 22:31.751
You know that and I know. But the cops
are going to say it was a heart attack.

22:31.928 --> 22:37.468
He's got no family, no will, no nothing.
That means his brother inherits this lot.

22:37.642 --> 22:42.600
I promised him I wasn't going to let that
son of a bitch get his hands on this lot.

22:51.448 --> 22:53.939
- Easy!
- Hey, don't worry about it!

22:54.117 --> 22:58.695
Look, I helped put it up, I ought
to know how to take it down!

22:58.872 --> 23:01.078
Okay, let it down easy.

23:07.964 --> 23:13.006
Hey, man, this shit gives me the creeps.
He should be buried properly.

23:13.178 --> 23:18.682
Nobody's gonna believe he drove his
Edsel to Miami. Nobody goes to Miami!

23:18.850 --> 23:23.595
Old people go to Miami! Where
do you want him to go? Aspen?

23:23.772 --> 23:28.564
- This crate won't go around the block!
- This motherfucker runs!

23:28.735 --> 23:32.104
Please show a little
respect for the dead!

23:43.166 --> 23:46.617
- You want to say something?
- Me? No.

23:46.795 --> 23:49.914
- Jim?
- About what?

23:50.090 --> 23:52.378
All right...

23:52.550 --> 23:58.386
Luke Fuchs, you're about to drive
over the curb for the last time.

23:59.432 --> 24:04.509
He was a good man, an
honest man, a trusted man.

24:04.687 --> 24:08.436
We can't carve your name
on a granite tombstone...

24:08.608 --> 24:11.858
but we can keep it flying
high above this lot.

24:12.028 --> 24:14.780
We can't put flowers
on your grave...

24:14.948 --> 24:21.033
but we can hang the finest vinyl pennants
and pinwheels that money can buy.

24:21.204 --> 24:27.325
You'll be surrounded by an inventory
of the finest quality discount cars.

24:27.502 --> 24:32.923
Ford, Chrysler, general motors
will be your headstone.

24:33.967 --> 24:39.174
High volume, high visibility
will be your epitaph.

24:39.347 --> 24:41.589
Rest in peace, Luke.

24:51.484 --> 24:54.189
Keep shovelling.

25:05.623 --> 25:09.752
Aren't you a little big to be
playing in the fucking mud?

25:09.919 --> 25:13.004
- We're landscaping.
- We had some flooding last night.

25:13.173 --> 25:15.746
So, what can I do you for?

25:15.925 --> 25:20.718
- I'd like to talk to my brother.
- You're gonna have to talk kind of loud.

25:20.889 --> 25:24.969
- He went to Miami late last night.
- That's right, Miami.

25:25.143 --> 25:30.184
- Miami?
- Yeah, Miami beach.

25:30.356 --> 25:33.772
- Florida.
- I know where the fuck Miami beach is.

25:33.943 --> 25:36.897
Some asshole fucked
up one of his cars...

25:37.072 --> 25:40.654
so he decided he needed a little
R and R. He's got a bad heart.

25:40.825 --> 25:44.241
- I know all about his Goddamn heart.
- I'm sure you do.

25:44.412 --> 25:47.615
- What airline did he fly?
- Edsel.

25:49.793 --> 25:52.794
I couldn't believe it either,
but that thing runs like new.

25:52.962 --> 25:55.169
That's bullshit, Russo!

25:55.340 --> 25:57.961
He had a stroke.
I saw him hit the floor.

25:58.134 --> 26:03.259
What? Last night? He slipped on some
90-weight. He's okay, believe me.

26:03.431 --> 26:06.800
He's lying, Sam. The son
of a bitch is lying!

26:06.976 --> 26:09.598
He thinks I'm lying, Jim.

26:09.771 --> 26:15.394
Luke told me to have you arrested for
trespassing. Do I have to call the cops?

26:15.568 --> 26:19.020
- Do we have to call the cops?
- Are you a fucking parrot?

26:19.197 --> 26:23.942
- Come on, Roy, let's go.
- Suck-ass son of a bitch.

26:25.453 --> 26:28.288
Get the hell out of here!

26:28.456 --> 26:32.952
- See, we got nothing to worry about.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

26:33.128 --> 26:37.836
We've got a dead guy buried here and
we're going on TV illegally tonight.

26:38.007 --> 26:40.000
We need customers.

26:40.176 --> 26:43.426
Sneaking a commercial into
a football game is illegal!

26:43.596 --> 26:46.004
Freddie and Eddie know
what they're doing.

26:46.182 --> 26:50.310
What if the FCC wants to bust
us for false advertising?

26:50.478 --> 26:54.939
We just work here. They'll
have to talk to the boss.

26:59.821 --> 27:01.979
Coast is clear, Freddie.

27:02.157 --> 27:04.826
All right... and out.

27:18.923 --> 27:20.583
Freddie, come here.

27:20.759 --> 27:24.626
Are we gonna be able to film
under these blue lights?

27:24.804 --> 27:27.805
We're not going to film
under the blue lights.

27:27.974 --> 27:33.348
That's why I've got the sun guns
mounted on the van. Trust me, will ya?

27:33.521 --> 27:36.356
- Rehearsal!
- We just sell this purple olds.

27:44.949 --> 27:49.030
Margaret, this is where you
show us how you're gonna sit.

27:49.204 --> 27:52.288
A little thigh to keep
their attention...

27:52.457 --> 27:57.000
and then I'll say, "okay, Margaret,
why don't you tell us about this one?"

27:57.170 --> 28:03.504
This '76 delta 88 is really equipped
with white walls, radio and heater.

28:03.676 --> 28:05.753
For only $695.

28:05.929 --> 28:10.258
Maroon car, my ass.
This motherfucker is red...

28:10.433 --> 28:14.301
then I'm going to say, "and be sure
to check out those high beams."

28:14.479 --> 28:18.607
I make a little tit joke.
I'm sorry this is so sexist...

28:18.775 --> 28:22.358
- nice maroon car, ain't it?
- Yeah, purple...

28:27.075 --> 28:33.113
- did you remember the sunglasses?
- I got something better. It's perfect...

28:34.165 --> 28:38.080
idiot! You trying to murder me?
Trying to assault my person?

28:38.253 --> 28:41.456
This is perfect. They're disguises.

28:41.631 --> 28:46.210
- What the hell is this?
- You're lucky, I only have three left.

28:47.804 --> 28:51.588
Here we go. Do me a favour
and just put 'em on.

28:51.766 --> 28:56.642
Rudy, come on! I'm not doing
a commercial wearing these.

28:56.813 --> 29:02.602
- Sweetheart, you'll look great.
- We'll look like assholes!

29:02.777 --> 29:06.775
- Stand by!
- Jeff, put 'em on. I'm serious.

29:06.948 --> 29:09.106
- No!
- Stand by!

29:09.284 --> 29:12.487
- Ready when you are, Freddie.
- He's got it at the forty.

29:12.662 --> 29:14.987
- Put 'em on, Jeff!
- No, forget it!

29:15.165 --> 29:18.616
- He's past the midfield stripe!
- No way!

29:18.793 --> 29:20.833
He's on the thirty!

29:21.004 --> 29:23.080
- Put 'em on!
- It's out of the question.

29:23.256 --> 29:25.712
- He's on the twenty.
- No!

29:25.884 --> 29:27.426
- Put 'em on!
- No, no, no!

29:27.594 --> 29:29.467
- And Eddie...
- What?

29:29.637 --> 29:32.923
- Take it!
- Okay, Freddie.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.138
My god, it's a red car.

29:41.316 --> 29:48.694
That's a stupid place for a commercial.
I don't believe it! Did you see that?

29:48.865 --> 29:52.530
Let's look at one of these
beautiful models, shall we?

29:54.913 --> 29:58.448
- What the fuck is this, Rudy?
- What did he say?

29:58.625 --> 30:02.669
You know he just said "fuck"?
That's an FCC violation.

30:02.837 --> 30:05.838
A red chariot to take my
ass straight to hell!

30:06.007 --> 30:07.799
Margaret! Get out there!

30:13.723 --> 30:16.510
Holy Jesus! She's caught
on the hood ornament.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.677
Stupid bitch! I hate women!

30:20.939 --> 30:23.264
Rudy, look! It's a red car!

30:23.441 --> 30:27.439
Well, folks, these people
are obviously hysterical...

30:27.612 --> 30:31.610
over the fabulous deals we have
here at new deal used cars.

30:31.783 --> 30:36.694
We've got over ten jillion cars down here.
Every one a best deal like that.

30:36.871 --> 30:40.371
- Let's take a look under the hood.
- What?!

30:50.009 --> 30:53.343
- Hey, look, bare tits!
- That's disgusting!

30:53.513 --> 30:56.051
I don't want my
children to see that!

30:56.224 --> 31:00.518
All those years at
film school paid off.

31:07.736 --> 31:10.902
Holy Jesus palomino!

31:11.072 --> 31:14.192
Seduce the camera...

31:14.367 --> 31:16.656
come on down to new
deal used cars...

31:18.496 --> 31:22.031
come on down and leave it to us.

31:29.090 --> 31:34.251
Front page advertising and it's free.
Can you believe it?

31:34.429 --> 31:40.763
- This is it, guys, it's time.
- I never sold no damn cars before.

31:40.935 --> 31:45.313
Just get 'em in that car. Nothing sells
a car better than the car itself.

31:45.482 --> 31:50.856
You gotta get their friendship, their
trust, then get their money. Ready, Jeff?

31:51.029 --> 31:53.864
Jim? Toby? You ready?

31:57.494 --> 31:59.570
Okay, guys...

32:00.622 --> 32:02.698
let's go!

32:07.003 --> 32:09.043
Morning!

32:09.214 --> 32:13.128
- Hi, there, Mr and Mrs...?
- O'hara.

32:13.301 --> 32:17.133
Rudy O'Brian, how are ya?
I've got this '74...

32:17.305 --> 32:20.057
- hi there, Mr and Mrs...?
- Lopez, señor.

32:20.225 --> 32:25.100
Rudy Garcia. '68 Chevy...
take a look at it, I'll be right back.

32:25.271 --> 32:27.560
- Hi there, Mr and Mrs...?
- Jackson.

32:27.732 --> 32:32.643
Hey, Rudy Washington carver.
You checking out this Cadillac...

32:32.821 --> 32:38.325
look at that, Mrs Ingallheart, the
interior matches the colour of your eyes.

32:38.493 --> 32:42.194
I just noticed something else.
Mrs Lopez, do you realise...

32:42.372 --> 32:47.248
that your hair matches the
colour of these tyres?

32:47.419 --> 32:51.831
- Let me get the door for you.
- That's all right, I'm just looking.

32:52.006 --> 32:57.001
- Yeah, well, I want you to look inside.
- No, I don't want to get inside.

32:57.178 --> 33:01.639
- It's comfy, roomy, a lot of leg room.
- I've just been looking around.

33:01.808 --> 33:03.801
These aren't the cars I bought.

33:03.977 --> 33:07.346
These are the cars your students
will be able to afford.

33:07.522 --> 33:10.725
They should be learning
to drive in these cars.

33:10.900 --> 33:14.067
- But the school board...
- They'll thank you.

33:14.237 --> 33:18.484
Now, I'm the kind of guy that believes
that a man with your insight...

33:18.700 --> 33:24.785
should be fairly compensated for
such high thinking, don't you agree?

33:25.832 --> 33:27.990
Do you have a car in mind for me?

33:28.168 --> 33:32.711
- I want you to look inside.
- I don't want to look inside!

33:32.881 --> 33:37.293
Just get in the motherfucking car!
Get in there!

33:39.179 --> 33:43.128
Boys! Out of the car! Now!

33:45.226 --> 33:51.015
- Well, you like animals, don't you?
- Yeah, I got three dogs of my own.

33:51.191 --> 33:56.232
Then you understand when I say that not
only do I think this is the car for you...

33:56.404 --> 34:00.983
but Toby thinks this is the
car for you, don't you, Toby?

34:01.159 --> 34:04.326
There you see, isn't that cute?

34:07.248 --> 34:12.243
So, Al, the least we can do is
take the car for a test drive.

34:13.838 --> 34:17.503
Toby wants to go for a test
drive, don't you, Toby?

34:18.885 --> 34:24.045
- Test drive with Toby, how about it, Al?
- All right.

34:25.766 --> 34:30.761
Okay, everybody in the car!
In the car, kids!

34:30.938 --> 34:35.315
Everybody in the car,
test drive with Toby...

34:35.485 --> 34:40.443
we're going for a test drive
with Toby, that's right...

34:48.289 --> 34:53.496
so, Al, listen, this
baby's got a big engine...

34:53.670 --> 34:56.873
a lot of power, big v8.

34:57.047 --> 35:02.291
I want you to feel that pickup.
So just go right ahead and punch it.

35:02.470 --> 35:04.712
Punch it?

35:07.726 --> 35:09.006
Stop!

35:15.108 --> 35:16.686
Oh my god!

35:24.117 --> 35:30.120
You killed my dog, mister.
You killed my dog!

35:30.290 --> 35:32.863
I'm sorry...

35:33.043 --> 35:38.713
all he wanted was for you to be happy
in this car... and now he's dead.

35:38.882 --> 35:42.251
How was I supposed to know...?

35:42.427 --> 35:47.634
- We raised it from a puppy...
- How could you?

35:49.642 --> 35:54.850
Look, mister, I know I can't
bring your dog back...

35:59.444 --> 36:03.572
but... how about if I buy the car?

36:15.543 --> 36:21.997
Nail 'em for false advertising.
They said they had 10 million cars.

36:22.175 --> 36:25.211
They said they had
ten jillion cars.

36:25.387 --> 36:29.254
Even if they said ten million,
I've got to prosecute the owner.

36:29.432 --> 36:32.552
He's off on a fishing
expedition in Florida.

36:32.727 --> 36:37.888
Fishing expedition, my ass! He's sitting
at the bottom of a lake someplace.

36:38.066 --> 36:40.557
You've got no proof.

36:40.735 --> 36:44.484
What do I need proof for?
I'm Roy I. Fuchs, goddammit!

36:44.656 --> 36:48.404
If you won't help me put them out
of business, I'll do it by myself.

36:48.576 --> 36:53.452
By using the greatest tool this country
ever developed: Free enterprise.

36:53.623 --> 36:56.458
The American way!

36:56.626 --> 37:03.673
This is the best goddamn gimmick I've
come up with so far, this circus idea...

37:03.842 --> 37:08.385
come on in, ride the camel, feed
the helium and drive out a car.

37:08.555 --> 37:12.718
Come on in, join the circus!

37:15.603 --> 37:19.055
Look at them over there.
Not a customer on the lot.

37:19.232 --> 37:24.653
That commercial was a fluke.
They're practically out of business.

37:24.821 --> 37:30.610
Yeah, that's what the people want:
Old-fashioned, homespun entertainment.

37:30.785 --> 37:34.569
That's what Roy I.
Fuchs stands for too.

37:34.748 --> 37:38.199
I just hope that Goddamn camel
don't shit all over the lot.

38:12.827 --> 38:17.703
Folks! Here at new deal used cars
we are stripping away inflation!

38:17.874 --> 38:20.330
We're taking off those high prices!

38:20.502 --> 38:24.499
We're getting down to the bare
minimums, so come on over...

38:24.672 --> 38:32.004
and check out the front ends of these
beauties and inspect the rear ends too!

38:59.791 --> 39:01.119
Scum...

39:16.015 --> 39:21.472
all you have to do is sign
your name right here...

39:21.646 --> 39:25.691
over there we have a group
of immoral charlatans.

39:25.859 --> 39:29.393
They will stoop to the lowest...
oh shit, cut it! What?

39:29.571 --> 39:33.319
- You can't say that on TV.
- I can say any Goddamn thing I want.

39:33.491 --> 39:37.192
- This is the American way.
- It's slander, they can sue you.

39:37.370 --> 39:42.246
Only the owner could sue me and he
has to be alive. Now get out of here.

40:52.529 --> 40:57.689
Hey, Rudy, it's old Lorette here.
I was out buying some peroxide today-

40:57.867 --> 41:03.621
and there was this clerk who looks
just like you and it got me thinking...

41:06.710 --> 41:08.667
hi, Rudy, this is Nadine.

41:08.837 --> 41:14.756
If you don't have a date, I bought
this new Barry Manilow record today...

41:18.930 --> 41:22.762
it's Mary Lou Bainbridge, if you
throw out my number again...

41:23.810 --> 41:29.813
Rudy, it's Jeff. Watch the channel 12
movie tonight, we're in big trouble.

41:35.030 --> 41:40.949
A menace that should be brought to the
attention of every decent citizen.

41:41.119 --> 41:45.448
Behind me is the automobile
business at its absolute worst.

41:45.623 --> 41:50.866
A group of immoral charlatans,
masquerading as businessmen.

41:51.046 --> 41:56.004
They will stoop to the lowest, most
vulgar, vile and disgusting ploys...

41:56.176 --> 41:59.758
to deceive the honest,
hard-working citizen.

41:59.929 --> 42:03.345
They are the lowest form of scum
on the face of the earth...

42:03.516 --> 42:06.387
son of a bitch!

42:06.561 --> 42:10.179
This is Roy I. Fuchs,
pre-owned automobiles.

42:12.650 --> 42:14.857
Just a second, pal!

42:15.028 --> 42:17.317
Jam the presidential address?

42:17.489 --> 42:21.023
I hate to break this to you, but
you're out of your friggin' mind.

42:21.201 --> 42:23.573
You've gone right over the edge...

42:23.745 --> 42:27.992
national television, we'll be on all
three networks at the same time.

42:28.166 --> 42:30.574
- How's that even done?
- Freddie?

42:30.752 --> 42:33.539
- Microwaves.
- Great, little ovens...

42:33.713 --> 42:39.218
it's simple. You take the microwaves
and you bounce 'em off a Comsat.

42:39.386 --> 42:41.841
A communication satellite.

42:42.013 --> 42:45.347
We bounce the microwave
off the comsat to Eddie...

42:45.517 --> 42:49.929
on the roof of the phone
company in Washington DC.

42:50.105 --> 42:55.728
We intercept carter's transmission
and jam it with our own.

42:55.902 --> 43:00.398
- Is this a great idea?
- When is this presidential address?

43:00.573 --> 43:02.483
Tomorrow night, nine o'clock.

43:02.659 --> 43:08.115
We should break in around 9.03,
before the audience gets too bored.

43:08.289 --> 43:10.247
Jesus, guys, I don't know.

43:10.417 --> 43:14.461
My horoscope says,
"trouble brewing on the horizon."

43:14.629 --> 43:19.042
And, I mean, we're fucking with the
president of the united states!

43:19.217 --> 43:21.257
He fucks with us, doesn't he?

43:21.428 --> 43:23.966
You've seen how shitty
business is today.

43:24.139 --> 43:30.592
Thanks to Fuchs, we had nuns
protesting outside when I got here.

43:30.770 --> 43:36.476
- Jim had to turn the fire hose on them.
- I knocked them right on their ass too!

43:36.651 --> 43:42.238
I'm still five grand short.
We've got to fight fire with fire.

43:42.407 --> 43:46.405
You'll be fighting fire with
enhanced radiation weaponry.

43:46.578 --> 43:49.662
You guys are sure you can
pull this off, right?

43:49.831 --> 43:52.536
Are we sure we can pull this off?

43:52.709 --> 43:56.707
If I can build and install a
pacemaker in this man's chest...

43:56.880 --> 44:00.664
I can damn well bounce a
microwave off a satellite!

44:00.842 --> 44:04.543
Jesus, look at this thing!
Look at this...

44:04.721 --> 44:07.176
only twelve ninety-five.

44:07.348 --> 44:09.840
Don't you have some
equipment to hook up?

44:10.018 --> 44:14.479
Oh shit! Radio shack closes
in half an hour. Let's go!

44:14.647 --> 44:17.814
- How do you change the batteries?
- It's rechargeable.

44:17.984 --> 44:22.860
Guys! Back door, it's still light outside.
See you tomorrow night.

44:23.031 --> 44:27.076
- Remember: We cut in at exactly 9.03.
- Post meridian.

44:27.243 --> 44:29.995
- What?
- Never mind.

44:30.163 --> 44:32.915
Okay, Freddie, 9.03.

44:40.131 --> 44:43.381
- What are you guys doing?
- Will you get down!

44:43.551 --> 44:46.422
- What?
- Do you see that woman out there?

44:48.807 --> 44:52.258
She's trouble. She pulled
up in that red Toyota.

44:52.435 --> 44:57.477
I'm not kidding! I think she's from
the consumer protection agency.

44:57.649 --> 45:01.397
You see the way she's looking at that
blue Chevy? She knows it's a taxi.

45:01.569 --> 45:03.361
You're paranoid.

45:03.530 --> 45:07.148
I bet you the first thing she
asks is, "where's the owner?"

45:07.325 --> 45:13.079
Girls who look that great don't work
for the consumer protection agency.

45:13.248 --> 45:17.115
Just don't let the little head do
the thinking for the big head.

45:17.293 --> 45:20.330
- Trust me.
- I do.

45:20.505 --> 45:24.254
Congratulations!
This is our giveaway week.

45:24.426 --> 45:27.925
Since you're our one
hundredth customer, you win.

45:28.096 --> 45:33.683
You just won a candlelight dinner for two,
but I can see there's only one of you.

45:33.935 --> 45:39.060
So I'll throw myself in with the deal.
How does that sound?

45:44.738 --> 45:48.735
Listen, can you tell me where
I might find the owner?

45:51.911 --> 45:56.372
Well... yeah...

45:56.541 --> 45:59.957
great, because, you see,
I was just trying to...

46:00.128 --> 46:04.920
let me tell you about this car. I can
give you an unbelievably low price.

46:05.091 --> 46:09.006
I would certainly hope so.
Look at the finish.

46:09.179 --> 46:13.093
- Is something wrong with the finish?
- Yeah, I see primer.

46:13.266 --> 46:15.472
Where?

46:15.643 --> 46:19.890
I see yellow primer here,
I see it here, I see it here...

46:20.065 --> 46:25.604
she's baiting him. She's
knows it's a taxi, Rudy!

46:25.779 --> 46:29.278
She's from the consumer
protection agency.

46:29.449 --> 46:34.490
I'm not with any consumer protection
agency. I used to be, but I'm not now.

46:34.662 --> 46:39.075
- Better business bureau? Nader's raiders?
- Trust me.

46:41.252 --> 46:46.591
As in, "trust me"?
So, look, about dinner...

46:46.758 --> 46:51.052
- listen, is Luke in his office?
- No. What do you feel like eating?

46:51.221 --> 46:54.672
- Do you expect him back shortly?
- No, he's out of town...

46:54.849 --> 46:59.891
- he's out of town? On business?
- Pleasure. He's in Miami beach.

47:00.063 --> 47:03.646
- Miami?
- Miami beach.

47:03.817 --> 47:07.102
I've been to Miami beach.
It's not that bad.

47:07.278 --> 47:09.900
I was supposed to
meet my father here.

47:10.073 --> 47:13.406
We'll find him, what kind
of car does he drive?

47:13.576 --> 47:17.444
He used to have a green
and white Edsel.

47:19.416 --> 47:23.248
Who do you think this is?
That's her.

47:25.630 --> 47:28.086
No resemblance.

47:28.258 --> 47:32.302
I've been selling cars long enough to
know when somebody's telling the truth.

47:32.470 --> 47:36.420
That is Luke's daughter. Do we have any
health food restaurants in this town?

47:36.599 --> 47:40.265
If that's Luke's daughter,
we've got to get rid of her.

47:40.437 --> 47:44.269
What if she figures out what's going on?
What if she sees our commercial?

47:44.441 --> 47:47.892
Why not just throw her in
the hole with her old man?

47:48.069 --> 47:51.189
When I take her out to
dinner, I'll get her drunk.

47:51.364 --> 47:55.492
I'll tell her the reason that
Luke went to Florida was...

47:55.660 --> 47:58.827
best salad bar in town:
Airport lanes!

47:59.914 --> 48:01.990
Oh, stop it...

48:02.167 --> 48:06.247
and he says, "don't ask
me, I'm just a farmer."

48:09.632 --> 48:14.093
That is the most disgusting
joke I've ever heard.

48:19.017 --> 48:22.267
- Listen, I wanted to ask you something.
- What?

48:22.437 --> 48:26.517
How did you know that I used to work
for the consumer protection agency?

48:26.691 --> 48:31.852
The thing with the taxi? Why didn't
you tell me it was yellow primer?

48:32.030 --> 48:36.526
I knew you were baiting me, so I
told you a bigger bunch of bullshit.

48:36.701 --> 48:41.244
At least you're very honest about
your dishonesty and I admire that.

48:41.414 --> 48:44.332
I really do.

48:52.050 --> 48:56.000
Look, Barbara, about Luke...
I got to tell you something...

48:56.179 --> 49:01.339
- Luke left for Florida the night I called.
- That's not the reason he left.

49:01.518 --> 49:08.398
I think it would be better for me and for
everybody concerned if I just leave.

49:08.566 --> 49:13.027
I was thinking of heading up to
Oregon or something like that.

49:14.989 --> 49:19.782
Thank you very much for taking care
of me. It was very considerate.

49:19.953 --> 49:27.201
I really had a good time. Maybe
we'll do it again sometime.

49:28.586 --> 49:32.714
Thanks a lot. Goodbye... thanks.

49:38.763 --> 49:41.848
Barbara... wait a minute.

49:44.436 --> 49:49.228
Look, I know that sometimes
I can come off as...

49:49.399 --> 49:53.942
kind of insincere, but...

49:55.447 --> 49:59.195
I want you to know that
I really like you.

49:59.367 --> 50:05.655
I haven't had this much fun with
a girl ever... in my life, so...

50:05.832 --> 50:12.369
once you and Luke get your problems
worked out, come by and look me up.

50:35.153 --> 50:39.566
I've been thinking about what
you've been saying about Luke...

50:39.741 --> 50:44.486
I'm passing judgement on a man
I haven't even seen in ten years.

50:44.662 --> 50:47.450
I have to give him the
benefit of the doubt.

50:47.624 --> 50:50.827
So I've decided to stick
around for a few days.

50:51.002 --> 50:54.751
So, see you tomorrow, okay?
Goodnight.

51:01.096 --> 51:04.132
- She's staying?
- Yeah, she's staying.

51:04.307 --> 51:07.557
I told her Luke would call.
What else could I do?

51:07.727 --> 51:09.352
What the fuck is that?

51:09.521 --> 51:13.186
If she sees our commercial,
she's going to be suspicious.

51:13.358 --> 51:17.356
We're going to have a billion
people on the lot tomorrow.

51:17.529 --> 51:20.945
I've been up all night,
trying to figure this out.

51:21.116 --> 51:24.734
There's only one thing we can
do: Cancel the commercial.

51:24.911 --> 51:28.031
Guys, I've got the
solution to our problem.

51:28.206 --> 51:31.622
Courtesy of the beautiful Daphne.
What I have here...

51:31.793 --> 51:34.664
is a one-way train ticket to Miami.

51:34.838 --> 51:37.459
You take it out there
and give it to Barbara.

51:37.632 --> 51:41.297
Tell her Luke called and wants
her to come straight down.

51:41.469 --> 51:48.386
Jim and I will do the commercial,
you get her on the train at midnight.

51:48.560 --> 51:51.181
I feel horseshit enough as it is.

51:51.354 --> 51:54.438
I took her to a bowling
alley, for Christ's sake!

51:54.607 --> 51:56.730
I can't do this to her.

51:58.820 --> 52:01.441
What would a senator do, huh?

52:21.259 --> 52:24.295
Don't you like your salad?

52:28.349 --> 52:32.098
Where are you?
You're certainly not here.

52:35.231 --> 52:42.112
I was thinking how much easier everything
would have been if you'd come last week.

52:42.280 --> 52:45.234
I don't understand. Why?

52:52.999 --> 52:55.490
There's something
I got to tell you.

52:55.668 --> 52:58.705
I don't know if this is
the right time, but...

52:58.880 --> 53:02.296
the truth of this whole
thing is that Luke...

53:02.509 --> 53:05.628
sir? I believe you dropped this.

53:05.804 --> 53:08.010
Thanks.

53:08.181 --> 53:10.387
Wait a minute.

53:10.558 --> 53:13.096
Rudy, this is a ticket to Miami.

53:13.269 --> 53:17.563
- I was going to wait till after dessert.
- You talked to Luke last night?

53:17.732 --> 53:20.354
Well, no...

53:20.527 --> 53:24.524
I tried to get a hold of him, but he's
still on that fishing charter and...

53:24.698 --> 53:31.151
- I just decided to take it on myself.
- That's the most considerate thing.

53:31.329 --> 53:34.947
- But I can't go.
- What?

53:35.125 --> 53:41.293
I don't want to force myself on him,
I just want to wait till he comes back.

53:41.464 --> 53:47.088
And, besides, I'm having a wonderful time.
You're really great company.

54:14.831 --> 54:16.076
Perfect.

54:36.603 --> 54:41.728
Okay, okay... Freddie?
We got to go, Jim's ready.

54:41.900 --> 54:45.019
The president isn't ready and
he's a bit more important.

54:45.195 --> 54:48.314
- We got to go!
- Why are you so nervous?

54:48.490 --> 54:52.439
I'm not nervous! I'm so full of
valium, I rattle when I walk!

54:52.619 --> 54:56.663
All right, fine...
Could I offer you a sleeping pill?

55:08.385 --> 55:11.967
- Listen, if I take any more shit...
- Aha! There we are.

55:12.138 --> 55:15.507
- What the hell is this?
- This is a test pattern.

55:15.683 --> 55:20.844
Okay, I'm receiving your test
pattern, you're looking real good.

55:21.022 --> 55:24.272
Carter goes on in 28 seconds.

55:24.442 --> 55:29.437
The programme originally scheduled
will not be seen in order that...

55:29.614 --> 55:32.449
I didn't know president
carter was going to be on TV.

55:32.617 --> 55:36.318
Do you mind turning that thing off?
I'm trying to eat.

55:36.496 --> 55:39.865
Have a little respect. This
happens to be the president.

55:40.041 --> 55:43.742
Respect, my ass, food giant!
I'm paying 20 bucks for this meal.

55:43.920 --> 55:47.289
Well, how would you like
that TV stuck up your ass?

55:47.465 --> 55:50.632
Fellas, it's not worth
all this trouble.

55:54.180 --> 55:56.552
- I gotta get some air.
- Are you all right?

55:56.725 --> 56:00.936
- I gotta get some fresh air.
- Are you going to be okay?

56:06.109 --> 56:09.026
Are you all right?

56:10.947 --> 56:14.446
Good, just come over here
and sit down for a second.

56:25.462 --> 56:29.411
Inflation is obviously
a serious problem.

56:33.553 --> 56:35.047
What is the solution?

56:38.349 --> 56:40.841
You want the solution to inflation?

56:41.019 --> 56:45.930
Marshall lucky here, where we're
battling inflation not only-

56:46.107 --> 56:48.942
by fighting high prices...

56:49.110 --> 56:52.526
but by blowing the living
shit out of high prices!

56:52.697 --> 56:58.866
You heard me right! Here's an example:
1973 Cadillac coup Deville for $6299.

56:59.037 --> 57:01.492
That price is too high.

57:09.339 --> 57:14.879
Yes sir! Here's another one:
A Lincoln continental mark 4, 1973...

57:15.095 --> 57:18.629
it's loaded, it's got air
conditioning, it's got a stereo...

57:18.807 --> 57:22.756
it's got power steering, power breaks,
power seats, power windows...

57:22.936 --> 57:25.890
and a price that is just too high!

57:31.945 --> 57:35.396
Now, remember, friends...

57:35.573 --> 57:39.488
look out, Marshall
lucky, it's high prices!

57:39.661 --> 57:42.911
Take this, you dirty,
old high prices!

57:45.834 --> 57:47.910
You got me, Marshall!

57:48.086 --> 57:49.710
Jesus Christ...

57:52.590 --> 57:58.177
yes sir, so remember, friends,
that's new deal used cars.

57:58.346 --> 58:00.884
Now wait just a Goddamn minute!
What the hell is this?

58:01.057 --> 58:06.134
Is this a 1977 Mercedes
450 SL for 24000 dollars?

58:06.312 --> 58:09.646
That's too fuckin' high!

58:14.612 --> 58:17.566
You son of a bitch!

58:17.741 --> 58:21.074
We blew the shit out of that
overpriced motherfucker-

58:21.244 --> 58:26.404
just the way we blow the shit out of
all high prices at new deal used cars.

58:26.583 --> 58:28.741
So you all come on down!

58:28.918 --> 58:32.038
New deal used cars.
So you all come on down!

58:32.213 --> 58:34.336
Did you hear what I said?

58:34.507 --> 58:38.208
I have heard you with
unmistakable clarity.

58:38.386 --> 58:40.924
You son of a bitch!

58:46.144 --> 58:49.477
- Let's go!
- Move this motherfucker!

58:50.482 --> 58:53.317
A free economy cannot
cope with inflation.

58:53.485 --> 58:56.901
If we've lost our ability to
act as a nation, rather than...

58:57.072 --> 58:59.610
as a collection of
special interests...

58:59.783 --> 59:03.827
and I reply, "what kind of
people do they think we are?"

59:03.995 --> 59:06.202
You want to give me that again?

59:06.373 --> 59:11.200
As I say, I heard this large explosion,
I couldn't tell what was going on.

59:11.378 --> 59:16.289
I saw the car over there in flames and
all these strange little characters...

59:16.466 --> 59:21.887
with towels on their heads,
yelling, "ayatollah, ayatollah!"

59:22.055 --> 59:27.394
Then they all got in a car and drove away.
I guess it was Iranian students...

59:27.560 --> 59:31.605
out to discredit the
American way of life.

59:31.773 --> 59:34.774
I can't imagine who else
would do such a thing.

59:34.943 --> 59:37.019
Let's go.

59:38.905 --> 59:42.523
Sure hope you nail 'em.
Happy motoring.

59:51.042 --> 59:56.203
Hey, Jim, did those FBI guys...
were they... Jim?

59:58.675 --> 01:00:02.044
Combat fatigue... shit.

01:00:41.718 --> 01:00:44.921
I'll teach you to wreck my
cars, you son of a bitch!

01:01:00.445 --> 01:01:02.817
Okay, now, you asked for it now.

01:01:18.296 --> 01:01:20.621
Get off my back, you lunatic!

01:01:43.822 --> 01:01:46.776
All right, now I'm gonna
have to hurt you.

01:01:55.709 --> 01:01:57.997
Where's my brother?

01:02:03.133 --> 01:02:06.502
Where are you hiding
my brother, you...

01:02:18.189 --> 01:02:22.483
the pit... they filled in the pit!

01:02:47.761 --> 01:02:50.465
I knew it!

01:02:54.934 --> 01:02:57.805
Get off!

01:02:57.979 --> 01:03:00.102
Dumb dog!

01:03:06.738 --> 01:03:08.647
Get away!

01:03:10.575 --> 01:03:12.449
Get off!

01:03:12.619 --> 01:03:14.695
Get away, you dumb dog!

01:03:39.479 --> 01:03:43.975
Toby! You pissed on my...
goddammit!

01:04:00.792 --> 01:04:04.576
Now aren't you glad
I didn't go to Florida?

01:04:06.131 --> 01:04:10.923
Since you brought that up...

01:04:12.637 --> 01:04:16.421
there's something I gotta
get off my chest...

01:04:16.599 --> 01:04:21.760
this is Rudy. If you leave your name
and your number, I'll get back to you.

01:04:21.938 --> 01:04:26.185
Rudy, it's Jim! If you're there,
pick up! Emergency!

01:04:26.359 --> 01:04:28.482
What is it?

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.731
Jesus!

01:04:38.038 --> 01:04:40.873
Where are you now?

01:04:41.041 --> 01:04:43.911
Don't worry, I'll be right there.

01:04:44.085 --> 01:04:46.790
What is it? Is it about Luke?

01:04:46.963 --> 01:04:51.340
- No, no.
- Well, what then?

01:04:51.509 --> 01:04:54.083
What is it about? What's going on?

01:04:54.304 --> 01:04:59.464
Jeff, he got in a fight, I gotta go down
to the station house and bail him out.

01:04:59.642 --> 01:05:03.391
I'll be right back. See you later.

01:05:30.173 --> 01:05:34.218
Rudy, it's Jim. If you're there,
pick up! Emergency!

01:05:34.386 --> 01:05:36.508
What is it?

01:05:36.679 --> 01:05:39.799
Fuchs knows Luke's dead.
He found out where we buried him.

01:05:39.974 --> 01:05:42.050
- Jesus!
- He beat up Jeff!

01:05:42.227 --> 01:05:45.263
The cops are gonna
think we killed him!

01:05:45.438 --> 01:05:47.810
- Where are you now?
- At the lot!

01:05:47.982 --> 01:05:49.477
I'll be right there.

01:05:56.282 --> 01:05:59.782
The white house reaction
has been negative.

01:05:59.953 --> 01:06:05.196
Do you think we like being associated
with the president of the united states?

01:06:05.375 --> 01:06:07.332
We run an honest lot here!

01:06:23.852 --> 01:06:29.059
Come on, guys! We're not even open yet!
I told you to keep your ass off this lot.

01:06:29.315 --> 01:06:32.482
Yeah, show him the warrant, Sam.

01:06:32.652 --> 01:06:35.938
- Bring those picks over here!
- A search warrant?

01:06:36.114 --> 01:06:39.483
What the hell are you
guys looking for?

01:06:39.659 --> 01:06:41.451
Start digging over here.

01:06:41.619 --> 01:06:46.578
Hold on! You bust in here, disrupt our
business, start digging up our lawn...

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:49.620
at least tell us what the
hell you're looking for.

01:06:49.794 --> 01:06:52.499
You buried my brother
here and you know it.

01:06:52.672 --> 01:06:55.590
What? Roy, are you
looking for Luke?

01:06:55.759 --> 01:07:00.836
He was here 30 minutes ago.
He'll be right back.

01:07:01.014 --> 01:07:03.386
You spoke to Lucas
Fuchs 30 minutes ago?

01:07:03.558 --> 01:07:06.429
He got back from Miami
beach last night.

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.950
Oh shit, he smells!

01:07:30.418 --> 01:07:34.286
Come on, Luke... I'm sorry, Luke.

01:07:39.219 --> 01:07:41.840
Shut up, Toby! I hear you!

01:07:48.686 --> 01:07:50.809
Adios, Luke!

01:07:52.941 --> 01:07:57.935
I'm telling you guys, you're wasting
your time. Here he comes now!

01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:06.992
Jesus, he is still alive.
Where the hell is he going?

01:08:07.163 --> 01:08:11.706
- He's exceeding the speed limit.
- He's got to be drunk.

01:08:18.341 --> 01:08:21.710
He's heading right
for the transformer!

01:08:38.236 --> 01:08:40.727
All right, grab that pump!

01:08:40.904 --> 01:08:44.654
Very neat, Russo, very clean...

01:08:44.826 --> 01:08:49.903
plenty of witnesses, everything up
in flames, not a trace of evidence.

01:08:50.081 --> 01:08:54.660
Shrewd... kept yourself
out of jail.

01:08:54.836 --> 01:08:58.287
- Now get the fuck off my lot.
- Your lot?

01:08:58.465 --> 01:09:02.082
You just handed it to
me on a silver platter.

01:09:02.301 --> 01:09:08.720
Afraid not, Roy. Luke's got a daughter.
You remember Barbara? She's back in town.

01:09:08.892 --> 01:09:12.805
I bet you haven't seen her in ten years.
You wanna talk to her?

01:09:12.979 --> 01:09:16.313
She's staying over at my place.

01:09:20.444 --> 01:09:22.319
You son of a bitch.

01:09:25.492 --> 01:09:29.109
Get off me! Get this maniac off me!

01:09:29.287 --> 01:09:33.616
- Get him off!
- Okay, mac, come on, here you go.

01:09:33.792 --> 01:09:35.915
Oh my god...

01:09:36.086 --> 01:09:40.961
get your hands off me!
I'm Roy I. Fuchs, you son of a bitch!

01:09:42.634 --> 01:09:47.841
Barbara! There's been a terrible
accident, your father's dead.

01:09:48.014 --> 01:09:53.519
Why don't you tell her the truth, Russo?
He buried him back there in the Edsel!

01:09:53.685 --> 01:09:59.939
- Will you please tell me the truth?
- All right...

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:06.067
your father wasn't in
Miami, never was...

01:10:06.241 --> 01:10:13.287
he was in aspen. He didn't want you
to be here when he got back...

01:10:13.456 --> 01:10:17.240
Rudy, you're fired and you can
take your friends with you.

01:10:17.419 --> 01:10:19.495
Get off my lot!

01:10:31.182 --> 01:10:32.463
Shit!

01:10:34.269 --> 01:10:36.392
So? What do you say?

01:10:38.565 --> 01:10:42.147
I'll have to think about it.
He's an asshole.

01:10:42.318 --> 01:10:46.696
Don't think too long. A ninth-grader
was looking at it yesterday.

01:10:48.199 --> 01:10:52.363
Real grinders. Tougher to
close than their parents.

01:10:53.246 --> 01:10:57.196
Aw Christ... how am I gonna
come up with five grand?

01:11:00.754 --> 01:11:07.634
Why don't you call my bookie, put
some money on the game tonight, huh?

01:11:07.802 --> 01:11:11.847
I got a good feeling about Denver.
Here's his number.

01:11:12.015 --> 01:11:14.221
Denver's ranked tenth.

01:11:14.392 --> 01:11:20.976
That's right, but I found a dime in a
payphone booth this morning. Ten cents...

01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:25.610
minted in Denver. The numbers that I
dialled on the phone added up to ten.

01:11:25.779 --> 01:11:30.606
Today is the tenth... and you know what
time it was when I found the dime?

01:11:30.825 --> 01:11:33.399
Ten after ten!

01:11:33.578 --> 01:11:36.496
I can't lose, so I bet ten bucks.

01:11:36.664 --> 01:11:39.334
That's the dumbest fucking
shit I ever heard in my life.

01:11:39.501 --> 01:11:45.087
Superstitious crap... I'm gonna push
you under a ladder on friday the 13th.

01:11:49.969 --> 01:11:52.721
Why don't you just go
ahead and call her?

01:11:52.889 --> 01:11:56.590
She knows you belong on
that lot. Just call her.

01:12:04.818 --> 01:12:07.439
Okay, okay, okay...

01:12:10.907 --> 01:12:12.567
Mr Russo?

01:12:12.784 --> 01:12:15.536
This is Mr Caldwell,
the party chairman.

01:12:15.704 --> 01:12:20.780
The machine has to present its slate
of candidates the day after tomorrow.

01:12:20.959 --> 01:12:24.542
We'll need your contribution.
You do have it, don't you?

01:12:24.713 --> 01:12:27.630
- Yeah, I got it.
- Very good.

01:12:31.386 --> 01:12:33.462
Put it out! Put it out!

01:12:46.901 --> 01:12:48.775
Here's the script, boss.

01:12:48.945 --> 01:12:51.364
You're sure this is the one
they're filming over there now?

01:12:51.448 --> 01:12:54.982
- I swiped it right off the truck.
- Well, this stinks.

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:59.489
I wouldn't buy a car from anybody
who put this kind of shit on TV.

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:04.289
- Would you?
- I wouldn't.

01:13:04.461 --> 01:13:08.458
That's what I keep telling you. She
don't know what the hell she's doing.

01:13:08.631 --> 01:13:14.070
She hasn't sold a car in four days. At this
rate she'll be bankrupt in three weeks.

01:13:18.683 --> 01:13:21.435
Roy? Sam. Any progress
with your niece?

01:13:21.603 --> 01:13:24.972
No, she's as stubborn as her
old man. She won't sell dick.

01:13:25.148 --> 01:13:29.228
But I'll just bide my time.
She'll be bankrupt in two weeks.

01:13:29.402 --> 01:13:31.478
You haven't any time to bide.

01:13:31.654 --> 01:13:35.403
The mayor's going to announce the
new freeway the day after tomorrow.

01:13:35.575 --> 01:13:39.655
You'd better find some
sucker to buy your lot.

01:13:40.497 --> 01:13:42.738
Roy?

01:13:44.292 --> 01:13:50.662
Asshole mayor! We know
anybody over at channel 7?

01:14:00.767 --> 01:14:03.472
Now watch this.

01:14:03.645 --> 01:14:08.639
See the... style of cars we
have to choose from. We have...

01:14:10.068 --> 01:14:13.022
you see where she said "style"?

01:14:13.196 --> 01:14:18.819
See the... style of cars
we have to choose from...

01:14:19.911 --> 01:14:22.995
further on down she says this:

01:14:23.164 --> 01:14:30.246
3217 valley road,
just one mile... west of...

01:14:31.631 --> 01:14:35.380
a mile. I took the word mile
and I put it over style.

01:14:35.552 --> 01:14:37.710
Now watch this.

01:14:37.887 --> 01:14:44.305
Come on down and see the mile
of cars we have to choose from.

01:14:45.353 --> 01:14:47.725
Son of a bitch!

01:14:47.897 --> 01:14:50.435
Let me see that again.

01:14:53.361 --> 01:14:59.731
See the... mile of cars...
we have to choose from...

01:14:59.909 --> 01:15:03.492
Goddamn, that's terrific!
What do you think, Sam?

01:15:03.663 --> 01:15:06.415
Most blatant case of
false advertising.

01:15:06.583 --> 01:15:10.082
I could have her convicted
24 hours after it's aired.

01:15:10.253 --> 01:15:13.836
- When are they going to show that?
- During tonight's game.

01:15:14.007 --> 01:15:20.756
Why don't you come on down and see the
mile of cars we have to choose from?

01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:23.635
She said she had a mile of cars.

01:15:23.808 --> 01:15:26.050
Can you believe that?

01:15:26.227 --> 01:15:31.814
That's the most blatant claim of
false advertising I ever heard.

01:15:35.779 --> 01:15:38.863
She sure looks good,
though, doesn't she?

01:15:45.121 --> 01:15:48.490
Russo, I've been looking
all over for you.

01:15:48.666 --> 01:15:52.082
I'm about to lose my
job because of you.

01:15:52.253 --> 01:15:57.959
I've got more than 250 sophomores who
aren't going to pass driver education...

01:15:58.134 --> 01:16:01.254
because your frigging
cars won't run.

01:16:01.429 --> 01:16:06.008
You got an auto-shop class. Enroll your
sophomores and teach them something.

01:16:06.184 --> 01:16:08.141
I'll teach you something.

01:16:30.291 --> 01:16:33.495
What did I tell you, Rudy? Denver!

01:16:33.670 --> 01:16:36.422
When I get a feeling,
I get a feeling.

01:16:36.589 --> 01:16:40.421
Hell of a game! You should
have put some money on it.

01:16:40.593 --> 01:16:43.215
- I did.
- Great!

01:16:43.388 --> 01:16:46.175
On Kansas city.

01:16:48.893 --> 01:16:53.187
Kansas city? How much
did you put down?

01:16:54.983 --> 01:16:56.774
All of it.

01:16:56.943 --> 01:16:59.066
All of it?

01:17:00.196 --> 01:17:02.687
Everything I own.

01:17:05.702 --> 01:17:08.822
Forty gs?!

01:17:08.997 --> 01:17:14.157
You dope! You just threw
it right down the tubes!

01:17:14.335 --> 01:17:20.919
Don't you get it? The only way
you can win is if... if I lose.

01:17:22.969 --> 01:17:28.723
I wouldn't worry about that.
I think your money's in the bag.

01:17:28.892 --> 01:17:33.684
A minute to go... I think Denver would
have to run into some pretty bad luck.

01:17:33.855 --> 01:17:38.517
Denver would have to run
into some pretty bad luck...

01:17:56.544 --> 01:17:59.830
he fumbled the ball!
It's recovered...

01:18:00.006 --> 01:18:04.170
I got the ball... I got it.

01:18:05.678 --> 01:18:09.807
Hold this stuff, I gotta
turn this contest around.

01:18:09.974 --> 01:18:13.308
I got the ball, Jim.
I got a chance, babe.

01:18:13.478 --> 01:18:17.179
- More salt!
- Please god...

01:18:17.357 --> 01:18:24.854
no one seemed to hit him, and yet,
the ball squirted, just like magic...

01:18:25.031 --> 01:18:29.159
black magic, more like it, Danny...

01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:33.028
pass the ball...

01:18:36.418 --> 01:18:40.332
is there a black cat in the house?
How about a ladder?

01:18:44.718 --> 01:18:46.959
What the hell are you trying to do?

01:19:15.707 --> 01:19:17.166
Duck!

01:19:23.006 --> 01:19:27.584
Touchdown! I don't believe it!

01:19:32.223 --> 01:19:35.011
I made it!

01:20:18.269 --> 01:20:20.428
You got the money, Russo?

01:20:20.605 --> 01:20:23.476
Or should I say "senator Russo"?

01:20:29.114 --> 01:20:34.072
Mr tucker, I gotta tell you,
I'm a little bit nervous about...

01:20:34.244 --> 01:20:39.321
about what I'm supposed to do. What sort
of policies are you guys trying to push?

01:20:39.499 --> 01:20:45.288
The party shares the concern of the
American taxpayer, the working man.

01:20:45.463 --> 01:20:51.336
Here's the new freeway we're announcing.
My son-in-law got that contract.

01:20:51.511 --> 01:20:53.587
Fine boy!

01:20:53.763 --> 01:20:56.301
We're also in favour
of public facilities.

01:20:56.474 --> 01:21:00.721
We're going to tear down that
old hospital on the east side...

01:21:00.895 --> 01:21:02.888
and put in a nice golf course.

01:21:03.064 --> 01:21:07.892
Chairman Caldwell really likes to play
golf. Wins every tournament he plays in.

01:21:08.069 --> 01:21:12.648
He's got a 48 handicap, fine golfer.
And we're in favour of lowering taxes.

01:21:12.824 --> 01:21:16.074
Didn't you use to work there?

01:21:17.579 --> 01:21:19.571
Closed?

01:21:19.748 --> 01:21:22.073
The party's looking
out for the consumer.

01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:27.327
Last night, the proprietor made a false
claim on a television commercial.

01:21:27.505 --> 01:21:30.127
One of our constituents
brought it to our attention.

01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:35.425
The case goes before a judge in about
five minutes. Justice can be swift.

01:21:35.597 --> 01:21:39.345
What the hell do you mean you
got hanging judge Harrison?

01:21:39.517 --> 01:21:41.759
He's not on our take, he's legit!

01:21:41.936 --> 01:21:46.931
Remember that coloured kid found
guilty for stealing a case of beer?

01:21:47.108 --> 01:21:50.560
Hanging judge Harrison gave
him 35 years of hard labour.

01:21:50.737 --> 01:21:53.489
You need someone to throw
the book at this broad.

01:21:53.656 --> 01:21:58.864
I've paid off all the witnesses, I even
have her attorney on my payroll.

01:22:01.206 --> 01:22:03.282
I can win this case, Roy. Trust me.

01:22:04.334 --> 01:22:08.960
She's a first offender. That's a $500
fine, even if they do convict her.

01:22:09.130 --> 01:22:15.251
She's gonna be convicted and I'm afraid
the fine is going to be real severe.

01:22:15.428 --> 01:22:16.757
Jesus...

01:22:16.930 --> 01:22:19.503
there's only one thing she
can do: Sell that lot.

01:22:19.682 --> 01:22:22.600
Jesus Christ!

01:22:23.937 --> 01:22:26.642
Wait a minute, Russo!

01:22:29.484 --> 01:22:32.355
Hold it! Wait a minute!

01:22:35.407 --> 01:22:38.049
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!
The honourable H.H. Harrison presiding.

01:22:38.050 --> 01:22:40.761
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!
The honourable H.H. Harrison presiding.

01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:43.575
All rise!

01:23:15.447 --> 01:23:18.198
This court...

01:23:18.366 --> 01:23:21.237
is now in session.

01:23:23.038 --> 01:23:27.830
Do you solemnly swear to tell the
whole truth, so help you god?

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.296
I do.

01:23:46.311 --> 01:23:48.469
Excuse me...

01:23:48.646 --> 01:23:51.600
excuse me... pardon me... sorry.

01:23:51.775 --> 01:23:56.602
Mr Slaton? Will you
commence the questioning?

01:23:58.281 --> 01:24:00.689
Please state your
name and occupation.

01:24:02.494 --> 01:24:07.488
Barbara Jane Fuchs. I'm the
owner of the new deal car lot.

01:24:07.665 --> 01:24:13.870
We have heard testimony from
four qualified experts...

01:24:14.047 --> 01:24:18.590
right here in this courtroom, to the
fact that the commercial in question...

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:25.261
was authorised by you and was
not tampered with in any way.

01:24:25.433 --> 01:24:30.475
I put it to you, miss Fuchs: Do you have
a mile of cars to sell on your lot?

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.309
Yes! Lie!

01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:41.319
Could you repeat the
question, please?

01:24:44.202 --> 01:24:47.986
Do you have a mile of cars
for sale on your lot?

01:24:48.164 --> 01:24:52.791
When placed end to end, will the cars
on your lot total one mile in length...

01:24:52.961 --> 01:24:56.911
and may I remind you
you are under oath?

01:24:57.090 --> 01:25:01.752
- I don't know...
- Speak up, miss Fuchs!

01:25:09.519 --> 01:25:10.847
Yes.

01:25:17.902 --> 01:25:19.694
Order!

01:25:23.908 --> 01:25:27.159
Order! Order!

01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:33.576
Miss Fuchs?

01:25:35.086 --> 01:25:43.512
Are you absolutely certain that you
understood the gentleman's question?

01:25:49.059 --> 01:25:54.645
You realise, miss Fuchs, that one
mile of cars is over 250 cars?

01:25:54.814 --> 01:25:58.479
Are you aware that you've opened
yourself up to a charge of perjury?

01:25:58.651 --> 01:26:00.110
What?

01:26:00.278 --> 01:26:06.233
I can produce a number of witnesses who
will testify to the fact that she is lying.

01:26:06.409 --> 01:26:09.825
That she has, in fact, only 25
cars on her lot at this time.

01:26:09.996 --> 01:26:12.618
Why don't see for yourself, judge?

01:26:13.875 --> 01:26:16.544
Order!

01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:22.840
- I have no objection to that.
- Neither do I.

01:26:23.009 --> 01:26:27.137
Miss Fuchs, I'm gonna release
you on your own recognizance.

01:26:27.305 --> 01:26:33.343
Court will reconvene at 2.45 p.m.
At the new deal used car lot...

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:39.640
where I am going to settle
this matter once and for all.

01:26:50.161 --> 01:26:55.203
250 keys, 250 titles, 250 cars.

01:26:55.375 --> 01:27:01.211
But you've brought no transport trucks.
How are you gonna get them home?

01:27:01.381 --> 01:27:04.964
I have 250 drivers.

01:27:19.816 --> 01:27:22.307
What have I done to the children?

01:27:24.446 --> 01:27:29.950
- You want that one too?
- All of them, everything you got.

01:27:30.118 --> 01:27:32.739
How about some marijuana?
Some rifles?

01:27:32.912 --> 01:27:37.076
- Anything that doesn't start, we'll tow.
- Listen, take him up on the reefer.

01:27:41.463 --> 01:27:43.455
This had better work!

01:27:43.631 --> 01:27:48.459
You told me that your students
needed some road experience, right?

01:27:48.636 --> 01:27:50.843
They're gonna get a crash course.

01:27:51.014 --> 01:27:53.849
Hey, you, amigo!

01:27:55.101 --> 01:27:59.728
How about some rifles for your students?
Chico! Bring some rifles!

01:27:59.898 --> 01:28:05.105
Take your hands off me, sir!
I don't believe in violence!

01:28:06.696 --> 01:28:09.152
Forget about the rifles...

01:28:09.324 --> 01:28:11.613
I think she skipped town.

01:28:11.785 --> 01:28:16.660
Good! I'll win the damn thing on
a default. This calls for a toast...

01:28:16.831 --> 01:28:21.742
to the man who in two hours will be the
biggest car dealer in the southwest.

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:27.127
Me. Roy I. Fuchs.
Straighten that out, carmine.

01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:30.420
Drivers! To your cars!

01:28:40.021 --> 01:28:42.726
Jeff, do you read me?

01:28:42.899 --> 01:28:47.276
I just finished measuring these.
If we throw in the 26 cars on the lot...

01:28:47.445 --> 01:28:51.739
that gives us 18 feet
safety margin. That's one car.

01:28:51.908 --> 01:28:56.369
- That's playing it pretty close.
- Are we going to make it in two hours?

01:29:00.834 --> 01:29:03.835
You girls ready for some
heavy duty driving?

01:29:04.003 --> 01:29:09.757
Let's see, left hand at 10 o'clock
and right hand at 2 o'clock.

01:29:09.926 --> 01:29:11.171
Jeff, do you read?

01:29:12.971 --> 01:29:18.843
Yeah, you got your own "back door man",
I'll be bringing it up to your rear...

01:29:19.018 --> 01:29:22.103
will you watch where the
hell you're standing!

01:29:22.272 --> 01:29:24.893
You gotta find yourself
another car, nigger!

01:29:25.066 --> 01:29:30.606
This is the only Cadillac here and I
don't drive in nothin' but a cadillac.

01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:34.908
We're towing a car!
Have you ever towed a car before?

01:29:35.076 --> 01:29:36.736
- No.
- Oh great!

01:29:36.911 --> 01:29:40.660
Drivers! Start your engines!

01:29:51.092 --> 01:29:55.754
I'm gonna have to take one hand
off the wheel to start the car...

01:29:55.930 --> 01:29:59.596
you're not gonna flunk
me for that, are you?

01:29:59.768 --> 01:30:01.844
Just start the car.

01:30:04.355 --> 01:30:07.890
- You ready?
- Let's go.

01:30:08.943 --> 01:30:11.481
Let's move 'em out!

01:31:49.419 --> 01:31:51.874
Come on, baby, let's go!

01:31:52.047 --> 01:31:55.961
- How fast are we going?
- Fifty-five.

01:31:56.176 --> 01:32:00.672
At this rate, I think we're going
to be about half an hour late.

01:32:00.847 --> 01:32:05.426
Everybody listen up! We're gonna
have a lesson in driving history!

01:32:05.602 --> 01:32:10.596
This is how we used to drive on the
highways: At seventy-five mph!

01:32:10.774 --> 01:32:15.234
- Everybody seventy-five mph!
- Seventy-five!

01:32:35.548 --> 01:32:37.755
Put that pedal on the floor!

01:32:42.764 --> 01:32:45.634
I've got this
motherfucker wide open!

01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:56.815
This dude ain't no driving teacher,
he's some kind of con man.

01:32:56.986 --> 01:33:02.776
That's 20 miles over the speed limit.
At $10 a mile, that's a $200 fine.

01:33:02.951 --> 01:33:06.320
They can't fine us, we don't
have our license yet.

01:33:13.753 --> 01:33:15.829
It's the police! Stop!

01:33:21.219 --> 01:33:24.173
Oh shit! Wait...

01:33:25.765 --> 01:33:30.593
"at the scene of an accident,
always wait for the police to arrive."

01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:34.104
- This is eleven forty-four...
- They're here.

01:33:36.651 --> 01:33:40.102
Rudy, we just lost our
one-car safety margin, pal.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:44.693
You'd better scout ahead for more cops.
We can't take any more chances.

01:33:44.868 --> 01:33:47.406
Okay, ten-four.

01:34:08.767 --> 01:34:13.144
- How much do you owe me now, carmine?
- Twenty-seven.

01:34:15.857 --> 01:34:18.478
Look at that...

01:34:18.651 --> 01:34:22.317
I just heard some crazy
shit on my police scanner.

01:34:22.489 --> 01:34:27.198
There's a whole shitload of used cars
headed this way. You care about that?

01:34:39.547 --> 01:34:41.623
Shit!

01:34:47.055 --> 01:34:52.180
Rudy, I hope you read me 'cause
we got a real big problem.

01:34:53.561 --> 01:34:56.977
- What is it?
- Police roadblock.

01:34:57.148 --> 01:35:02.309
- What the hell are you gonna do?
- We're going to take a short cut.

01:35:36.855 --> 01:35:38.812
What are you... oh, hi, Roy.

01:35:38.982 --> 01:35:42.018
Did you see about 250
cars go by here?

01:35:42.193 --> 01:35:44.601
No, we haven't seen 'em yet.

01:35:44.779 --> 01:35:49.737
- Where the hell are they?
- Who cares? They'll never make it.

01:35:49.909 --> 01:35:54.536
Yeah, the only way they can get there
on time is to drive as the crow flies.

01:35:54.706 --> 01:35:58.205
- I wouldn't worry about it.
- What did you say?

01:35:58.376 --> 01:36:01.626
Never mind! Back up
there and take a left!

01:36:37.957 --> 01:36:40.246
You pea-brained ignoramus!

01:36:45.507 --> 01:36:48.508
What a beautiful day.

01:36:48.676 --> 01:36:54.382
Two thirty... whose idea was it,
going out to this used car lot?

01:36:54.557 --> 01:36:57.642
I could have been out playing golf.

01:37:06.528 --> 01:37:10.656
There they are!
Head for the lead truck!

01:37:15.161 --> 01:37:18.281
Hey, Rudy, looks
like we got company.

01:37:18.456 --> 01:37:21.956
Fuchs! What the hell is this?

01:37:25.547 --> 01:37:29.591
Get out and get in the back!
Get in the damn back!

01:37:29.759 --> 01:37:31.918
You're crazy!

01:37:32.095 --> 01:37:36.093
Don't give me no Goddamn lip!
Get in the Goddamn back now!

01:37:39.853 --> 01:37:42.094
What the hell is he doing?

01:37:46.651 --> 01:37:50.483
Hey, Rudy! You want me to
ram the son of a bitch?

01:37:50.655 --> 01:37:54.024
No! Keep going!
We're running out of time!

01:38:00.457 --> 01:38:03.541
Pull over closer!
Pull in behind them!

01:38:07.714 --> 01:38:09.837
Pull in behind them!

01:38:10.008 --> 01:38:14.421
Keep it going!
Don't stop for anything!

01:38:18.767 --> 01:38:20.012
He's got a gun!

01:38:20.185 --> 01:38:23.470
- Shoot the son of a bitch!
- You motherfucker, you!

01:38:27.567 --> 01:38:30.438
- Pull over!
- Get off of there!

01:38:32.489 --> 01:38:34.232
You motherfucker!

01:38:47.379 --> 01:38:49.704
Keep going!

01:38:55.595 --> 01:38:59.130
Slow down...
I want you bad, you fat-ass!

01:38:59.307 --> 01:39:04.646
I want you, man! I want you!
I gotta have you! I'm gonna get you!

01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:28.749
- Heavy duty, brother!
- Follow the black car!

01:39:31.756 --> 01:39:33.832
Thanks for dropping in!

01:39:41.891 --> 01:39:43.849
Get away from me!

01:39:55.196 --> 01:39:57.734
Stop that truck!

01:40:14.007 --> 01:40:18.883
What am I supposed to do when someone's
standing on the hood of my car?

01:40:19.054 --> 01:40:21.758
Close in! Faster!

01:40:21.931 --> 01:40:24.469
Move it up closer!

01:40:36.196 --> 01:40:38.484
Let go of him!

01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:51.038
You all right?

01:40:54.089 --> 01:40:56.959
Billingham,
let's move this chariot.

01:40:57.133 --> 01:41:01.048
I still may be able to
get in eight holes.

01:41:16.152 --> 01:41:20.814
What the hell is this now?
A mirror truck?

01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:23.279
I hope none of them's cracked...

01:42:09.289 --> 01:42:11.958
let's go! That's it!

01:42:21.092 --> 01:42:26.846
That's it! We made it! Nice job!

01:42:29.225 --> 01:42:31.467
That was some pretty heavy driving!

01:42:31.644 --> 01:42:35.310
- We missed page 35!
- We're here, aren't we?

01:42:35.482 --> 01:42:40.274
- This motherfucker's all right.
- This car is bad, I tell you, man!

01:42:40.445 --> 01:42:43.481
Well, did I pass the test,
Mr Ghertner?

01:42:43.656 --> 01:42:49.031
Yes, as long as you promise to get
your license in another state.

01:42:54.959 --> 01:42:59.206
I think we got plenty of time.
Look who's coming!

01:43:05.762 --> 01:43:07.422
We made it!

01:43:07.597 --> 01:43:15.178
I know you're seeing the same thing with
those itty-bitty beady eyes of yours.

01:43:15.355 --> 01:43:18.890
I tell ya, that sure looks
like a mile of cars to me.

01:43:19.067 --> 01:43:25.070
Let's just make sure, your honour.
Measure them! Every one of them!

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:28.110
No, sir! That's it!

01:43:28.284 --> 01:43:33.908
I mean, that's a red car...
I'm sorry, I tried...

01:43:36.876 --> 01:43:42.084
no, no, no, it's a red car.

01:43:42.257 --> 01:43:45.922
If Jeff don't get here, we're
going to be 18 feet short.

01:43:46.094 --> 01:43:47.837
Dammit...

01:43:49.973 --> 01:43:52.724
Jeff, come in!

01:43:52.892 --> 01:43:56.760
Jeff, come in! Are you there?

01:44:01.151 --> 01:44:03.309
Come in! Are you there?

01:44:03.486 --> 01:44:06.191
Are you there?

01:44:07.824 --> 01:44:10.659
- Jeff, come in, please!
- Where is he?

01:44:10.827 --> 01:44:15.406
- Yeah, Rudy, I'm here.
- Where's here?

01:44:15.582 --> 01:44:21.122
I'm parked near the railroad crossing
on valley road, near highway 9.

01:44:21.296 --> 01:44:25.459
Get over here! We're in a hurry!
Without your car we're 18 feet short!

01:44:25.633 --> 01:44:28.171
Can't they measure them any faster?

01:44:28.344 --> 01:44:32.045
What do you expect me to do?
Put roller skates on them boys?

01:44:32.223 --> 01:44:37.099
The paint washed off, Rudy,
and there's red paint underneath...

01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:40.721
you see, I can't drive
it, it's a red car!

01:44:40.899 --> 01:44:46.439
Jeff, you've been driving it all day.
It's all in your mind, you can do it...

01:44:48.323 --> 01:44:53.364
- which side of the tracks are you on?
- East.

01:44:53.536 --> 01:44:58.163
He's on the wrong side. The 2.45
is coming through. You've got to do it!

01:44:58.333 --> 01:45:00.622
- I can't do it.
- Red cars don't mean shit!

01:45:00.794 --> 01:45:04.412
I'm sorry... listen to me...

01:45:04.589 --> 01:45:11.007
there's grey primer underneath that red
paint, you're really driving a grey car.

01:45:11.179 --> 01:45:18.060
Please, Jeff, if you don't
get here, we lose the lot.

01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:24.059
- Fourteen seven!
- Seventeen feet, nine inches.

01:45:28.405 --> 01:45:31.109
What do you think, Toby?

01:45:33.702 --> 01:45:38.778
Shit! Wouldn't you know it?
For once the train's on time.

01:45:38.957 --> 01:45:43.120
- Seventeen six.
- Eighteen feet, four inches.

01:45:53.555 --> 01:45:57.884
- Seventeen feet, nine inches.
- Fourteen four.

01:46:18.705 --> 01:46:21.278
Come on!

01:46:31.593 --> 01:46:34.131
Eighteen feet, four inches.

01:46:34.304 --> 01:46:38.136
Is that the last car?
What's the final total?

01:46:38.308 --> 01:46:41.558
Come on! One of these...

01:46:57.327 --> 01:47:01.621
well, it'd better be a grey car...

01:47:35.198 --> 01:47:37.689
you cheated! You cheated!

01:47:37.867 --> 01:47:39.943
You cheated, you bastards!

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:44.663
Easy, Roy, they're on the
last car and they're short.

01:47:46.042 --> 01:47:53.255
Five thousand two hundred and sixty-two
and... eighteen will make a mile...

01:47:53.425 --> 01:47:58.217
here it is, right there!
You're eighteen feet short.

01:48:05.770 --> 01:48:08.807
Take it from the bumper!

01:48:13.403 --> 01:48:16.938
Ah... you're two inches short.

01:48:19.701 --> 01:48:26.534
5280 feet, a mile of cars!
Case dismissed!

01:48:31.588 --> 01:48:36.665
Wait a minute! Somebody pay you off?
A license plate don't count!

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:41.386
Come on, buddy! We won!

01:48:43.641 --> 01:48:45.219
Don't give me that shit!

01:48:45.393 --> 01:48:51.313
For uttering those contemptuous remarks,
I'm gonna put your balls in a sling.

01:48:51.483 --> 01:48:54.318
Deputies! Let's haul ass!

01:48:56.696 --> 01:48:59.401
Come on, buddy, come on...

01:49:03.953 --> 01:49:05.946
well, partner...

01:49:06.122 --> 01:49:10.202
that was terrific, what
you did here today.

01:49:10.377 --> 01:49:15.715
With that new freeway ramp, you're gonna
have the best freeway access in the state.

01:49:15.882 --> 01:49:19.465
You can have the biggest
dealership in the southwest.

01:49:19.636 --> 01:49:21.925
I know we've had our differences...

01:49:22.097 --> 01:49:26.225
but if you ever need a friend,
you've got one downtown.

01:49:26.393 --> 01:49:29.310
Thanks, Sam, thanks a million.

01:49:29.479 --> 01:49:31.518
Well... partners.

01:49:31.689 --> 01:49:35.438
Don't partner me! You knew about
that freeway the whole time.

01:49:35.610 --> 01:49:39.560
I didn't know anything,
this is the first I've heard of it.

01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:44.532
- Rudy, are you sure?
- Trust me.

01:49:44.703 --> 01:49:48.321
- Excuse me, miss...
- Ma'am?

01:49:48.498 --> 01:49:53.243
What's that yellow paint doing
on that car? Did it use to be a taxi?

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:57.963
- That car there?
- Yes, that car there.

01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:09.388
- No, ma'am, that's yellow primer.
- Yellow primer?

01:50:09.561 --> 01:50:12.977
Yes, that's being used on
a lot of cars these days.

01:50:13.148 --> 01:50:17.560
It's a rust preventative,
it adds life to the body...

01:50:23.014 --> 01:50:26.516
<i>It's all a big shuffle
cut and deal</i>

01:50:26.517 --> 01:50:30.020
<i>All the smart players
got a way to steal</i>

01:50:30.021 --> 01:50:33.023
<i>If you're a believer
you'll find out fast</i>

01:50:33.024 --> 01:50:36.526
<i>Like life and your pickup
nothing's made to last</i>

01:50:36.527 --> 01:50:40.030
<i>Used car
everybody's got one to trade</i>

01:50:40.031 --> 01:50:44.034
<i>Used car
everybody's got one to sell</i>

01:50:44.035 --> 01:50:48.538
<i>Used car buyer,
take care buyer, beware</i>

01:50:48.539 --> 01:50:50.040
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:50:50.041 --> 01:50:54.044
<i>You gotta spit on
it to make it shine</i>

01:50:54.045 --> 01:50:57.547
<i>You gotta hard sell it
move it down the line</i>

01:50:57.548 --> 01:51:01.051
<i>Like an old lover
it's slowing down</i>

01:51:01.052 --> 01:51:04.055
<i>You wanna change partners
you gotta shop around</i>

01:51:04.555 --> 01:51:07.558
<i>Used car

01:51:08.059 --> 01:51:11.561
<i>Used car

01:51:11.562 --> 01:51:16.067
<i>Used car buyer,
take care buyer, beware</i>

01:51:31.582 --> 01:51:35.585
<i>Are you a spring
dreamer ripe for love</i>

01:51:35.586 --> 01:51:39.090
<i>Spot a great body
you've been dreamin' of</i>

01:51:39.590 --> 01:51:42.592
<i>So you go for it
she's a heavy ten</i>

01:51:42.593 --> 01:51:45.596
<i>Paint peels off you've
been ripped off again</i>

01:51:46.097 --> 01:51:49.099
<i>Used car

01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:53.103
<i>Used car

01:51:53.104 --> 01:51:57.608
<i>Used car buyer,

01:51:59.610 --> 01:52:03.113

<i>Used car would I lie to you</i>

01:52:34.645 --> 01:52:38.649
<i>Used car buyer, take care</i>
