01:01.033 --> 01:03.100
Why do these things
always happen to me?

01:03.166 --> 01:05.767
I'm just a wreck.
I don't know what I'm going to do!

01:05.834 --> 01:07.633
Blanche, we go through
this every morning.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.266
Now, admit it, you have cellulite.

01:12.767 --> 01:16.600
I am not talking about cellulite...
which I don't have.

01:16.667 --> 01:18.200
I am talking about my daughter,
Janet.

01:18.266 --> 01:19.400
I just got off the phone with her.

01:19.467 --> 01:21.200
She's having Marital troubles.

01:21.266 --> 01:22.767
Oh, Blanche, I'm so sorry.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.500
But they've decided
to try and work things out,

01:24.567 --> 01:26.700
so they're going to Hawaii
for a second honeymoon.

01:26.767 --> 01:30.166
Well, sounds like they're trying
to work it out. Why are you upset?

01:30.233 --> 01:33.633
Don't you listen?
She has cellulite.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.667
Those are dimples.

01:35.734 --> 01:39.133
-Dimples are on these cheeks!
-Ma!

01:43.133 --> 01:45.800
I am upset because, while
they're in Hawaii for two weeks,

01:45.867 --> 01:48.433
they're leaving
my 14-year-old grandson with me!

01:48.934 --> 01:52.233
Oh, Blanche,
that's wonderful news!

01:52.300 --> 01:54.000
Why, you shouldn't be upset.

01:54.066 --> 01:56.734
No, I should be upset.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.066
How am I supposed to
study for my French final

01:59.133 --> 02:01.133
with a 14-year-old in the house?

02:01.200 --> 02:04.233
It's hard enough
with an 80-year-old!

02:04.300 --> 02:06.567
-Are you referring to me?
-Of course, not, Ma.

02:06.633 --> 02:09.567
I'm referring to Cary Grant.
He's living in the broom closet.

02:11.500 --> 02:15.266
Hey, it's Blanche's grandson.
We do for family.

02:15.333 --> 02:18.233
You're right, Ma. You're right.
I'm just being selfish.

02:18.300 --> 02:20.700
-Oh, it probably won't be too bad.
-No, I suppose not.

02:20.767 --> 02:23.266
But whatever will we do
with him for two weeks?

02:23.333 --> 02:25.900
There are plenty of
things to do down here.

02:25.967 --> 02:29.367
We can take him to Disney world,
the Seaquarium,

02:29.433 --> 02:33.767
-the everglades, Rambo...
-Rambo?

02:33.834 --> 02:36.767
The movie with Sly Stallone.

02:36.834 --> 02:38.767
I sat through it twice.
You'll love it!

02:38.834 --> 02:42.200
He sweats like a pig
and he doesn't put his shirt on!

02:47.633 --> 02:50.033
It's not gonna work.
I'm not sharing my room.

02:50.100 --> 02:53.667
Oh, Ma, Ma, I'm not thrilled
with the arrangement, either.

02:53.734 --> 02:56.300
But for the two weeks that
David is here, we'll Make do.

02:56.367 --> 02:59.066
Sure, it's easy for you.
I'm not the one who snores.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.900
I do not snore.

03:01.967 --> 03:06.367
Please! I'll bet less disgusting
noises come out of Ernest Borgnine!

03:08.934 --> 03:11.200
I just fixed a special
treat for David.

03:11.266 --> 03:14.233
It's the same little after-school
snack I used to make for my own son,

03:14.300 --> 03:18.433
a triple-decker BLT and a hearty
helping of homemade potato salad,

03:18.500 --> 03:20.867
and a great big slice of
double chocolate fudge cake.

03:20.934 --> 03:24.934
Oh, where was he going after
school, the electric chair?

03:25.934 --> 03:27.100
Oh, girls!

03:27.166 --> 03:29.033
What's the Matter?
Where's David?

03:29.100 --> 03:31.433
I don't know where he is.
He wasn't on the plane.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.033
Come on, Dorothy. I'll help you move
your things back to your room.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.233
Oh, Ma. Please!

03:36.300 --> 03:39.033
-Come on, Blanche.
-Now, calm down. Calm down.

03:39.100 --> 03:41.900
He probably missed the plane.
It can happen to anyone.

03:41.967 --> 03:45.166
I missed a plane once...
and a train--

03:45.233 --> 03:47.166
Rose, you miss a lot of things.

03:48.600 --> 03:51.867
He got on the plane, all right.
I checked with the airline.

03:51.934 --> 03:54.600
Well, you probably just missed each
other at the airport.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.333
Dorothy, I was standing
there at the gate

03:56.400 --> 03:58.734
from the moment
the first passenger got off.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.834
I paged him. I checked with airport
security. I called the police.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.800
-(doorbell rings)
-oh.

04:06.667 --> 04:09.800
-David, oh, David!
-Grandma!

04:09.867 --> 04:12.133
-Is this your kid?
-Honey, what happened to you?

04:12.200 --> 04:14.400
It wasn't my fault, I promise.

04:14.467 --> 04:17.667
He stowed away in the airplane
lavatory when they landed in Miami

04:17.734 --> 04:21.266
and the authorities picked him up
in the duty-free shop in freeport.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.300
You went to the Bahamas?

04:23.367 --> 04:27.300
I went to the bathroom! The next
thing I know, I'm in the Bahamas.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.533
And I figured while I was there,

04:28.600 --> 04:31.633
I'd buy some perfume for you and
your friends in the duty-free shop.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.200
-David.
-I'd keep an eye on this one, lady.

04:34.266 --> 04:36.867
Oh, I don't know how
to thank you, officer,

04:36.934 --> 04:39.000
but I would like to try.

04:39.066 --> 04:42.233
I'm usually at Wally's
for happy hour on Tuesdays.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.333
Blanche!

04:44.834 --> 04:45.633
Ma'am.

04:47.734 --> 04:48.900
Bye.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.533
David. I ought to give
you a good talking-to,

04:53.600 --> 04:55.100
but I'm just so glad
you're all right,

04:55.166 --> 04:57.200
I'm willing to overlook
this little incident.

04:57.266 --> 04:59.000
Now, come on, I
want you to meet my friends.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.367
Hello, David.
I'm Dorothy.

05:01.433 --> 05:03.400
-This is Rose.
-Hello, David.

05:03.467 --> 05:06.500
-Hey, what's happening?
-This is Sophia.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.000
Oh, we've just been
so anxious to meet you!

05:09.066 --> 05:12.033
Yeah, I'll believe that if you
believe the Bahamas story.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.900
You know, David,
I went to the Bahamas once.

05:14.967 --> 05:18.066
Oh, yeah? Was it on the Nina,
the Pinta, or the Santa Maria?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.767
It was a DC-10.
I don't think it had a name.

05:25.533 --> 05:28.000
Yeah, that's very funny, Rose.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.767
Yeah, I'm gonna grab a bite to eat.

05:29.834 --> 05:31.567
I passed this burger
joint around the corner.

05:31.633 --> 05:33.066
Looked like there might
be some kids there.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.800
Oh, but wait a minute.
You just got here.

05:35.867 --> 05:37.900
Oh, I'd really
prefer you to stay.

05:37.967 --> 05:40.000
I planned a special
meal for you, David.

05:40.066 --> 05:42.967
Tomorrow.
I love leftovers.

05:43.033 --> 05:46.834
-Well, what time will you be back?
-Hard to say.

05:46.900 --> 05:49.900
It depends how late the guys
from Miami vice want to party.

05:49.967 --> 05:51.667
Later!

05:51.734 --> 05:54.066
Well, I don't believe that!

05:54.133 --> 05:56.934
But then, what can I expect?
His father's a yankee.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.367
I guess I really should
have given him some money.

06:00.433 --> 06:02.600
-You should have given him a smack.
-Ma.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.667
I don't believe
in hitting children.

06:04.734 --> 06:08.800
Personally, I like to lay
into a kid with a melon baller.

06:10.667 --> 06:14.500
It's got a nice weight, good balance
in the hand, and it's portable.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.667
My father used to punish us by
sending us to the dairy barn

06:18.734 --> 06:20.100
to milk Alice.

06:20.166 --> 06:22.800
Well, what's so
terrible about that?

06:22.867 --> 06:25.266
You had to milk Alice
sitting on a stool.

06:25.333 --> 06:28.400
I thought you always milked
a cow sitting on a stool.

06:28.467 --> 06:31.467
No, no.
Alice had to sit on a stool.

06:34.066 --> 06:38.200
You see, she was involved
in this nasty plowing accident.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.834
It was during spring planting

06:42.900 --> 06:45.500
and daddy had hitched
her up to the plow

06:45.567 --> 06:48.900
'cause poor old Toby had
gotten a fever and gone deaf.

06:48.967 --> 06:51.066
Rose, Rose, Rose...

06:51.133 --> 06:53.000
sweetheart, save the story.

06:53.066 --> 06:55.000
When David comes back, tell him.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.867
That can be his punishment.

07:27.734 --> 07:29.133
Ma, what are you doing?

07:29.200 --> 07:31.800
Living. <i>Pardonnez-moi.</i>

07:32.300 --> 07:35.033
I just can't study
with the noise!

07:35.100 --> 07:37.333
Fine. I'll stop breathing.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.934
Look, I haven't studied
since David arrived.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.166
My test is...

07:47.166 --> 07:51.033
my test is in two weeks
and I do not want to blow it.

07:51.100 --> 07:54.200
-You'll pass, you'll pass.
-I don't want to pass. I want an A.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.800
You're the same as you were
in grade school, A's.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.266
You always had to get an A.

07:58.333 --> 08:01.934
Your brother thought a book was to
sit on. You always had to get an A.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.567
-Good night.
-Good night, mom.

08:03.633 --> 08:07.300
If I breathe and it bothers you,
put a pillow over my face.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.400
How could I sleep
with that racket?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.734
-What racket?
-Your pencil.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.900
-My pencil?
-You're pressing too hard.

08:24.967 --> 08:26.333
It's Making me crazy!

08:27.400 --> 08:28.433
I give up.

08:37.233 --> 08:38.934
-Look at me.
-What?

08:39.767 --> 08:41.633
-You're getting a cold.
-No, I'm not.

08:41.700 --> 08:43.700
Yes, you are.
Tomorrow, you'll have a cold.

08:43.767 --> 08:45.800
What is this,
the curse of the cat woman?

08:47.500 --> 08:49.767
I'm a mother.
I know these things.

08:49.834 --> 08:51.700
-Good night, Ma.
-Good night.

09:04.834 --> 09:06.767
-What's that smell?
-(sniffs)

09:07.567 --> 09:08.867
I don't smell anything.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.333
Are you wearing something?

09:11.967 --> 09:13.667
A little bengay on my knees.

09:16.467 --> 09:18.300
A little vicks on my chest.

09:22.066 --> 09:23.633
A little deep heat
on my neck.

09:25.533 --> 09:28.967
What are you trying to do, pickle
yourself so you'll live to be 100?

09:29.934 --> 09:33.066
Fine, I'll wipe it off.
Tomorrow, I'll be in a wheelchair.

09:33.133 --> 09:34.900
-Good night, Ma.
-Good night.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.700
Keep it up, I'll need a Dramamine.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.266
I'm trying to get comfortable.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.800
Not me. You get too comfortable,
you don't wake up!

09:56.934 --> 09:58.633
-Good night, Ma.
-Good night.

10:01.300 --> 10:04.100
(snorting, clearing throat)

10:08.567 --> 10:10.433
(continues clearing throat)

10:14.000 --> 10:15.367
-Ma.
-What?

10:15.433 --> 10:18.333
-That noise.
-What noise?

10:19.166 --> 10:21.500
The noise you're making
with your nose and throat.

10:21.567 --> 10:23.066
I got a postnasal drip.

10:23.133 --> 10:25.767
What would you like me to do,
drown in phlegm?

10:26.934 --> 10:28.934
-Good night, Ma.
-Good night.

10:34.200 --> 10:38.000
You know, we haven't slept together
since I was a little girl.

10:38.066 --> 10:39.400
Thank God.

10:41.500 --> 10:45.600
I used to get into your bed whenever
I had that dream about the bear.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.900
Yeah... the bear dream.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.934
I hated that dream.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.333
A bear is eating you.
What's to love?

10:56.400 --> 10:58.533
You were so cute.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.934
You were always so polite
when you woke me.

11:01.700 --> 11:05.734
(deep voice)
"Mommy, I'm having a bad dream.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.266
Could I come in?"

11:08.500 --> 11:10.834
I felt so safe with you.

11:10.900 --> 11:13.767
Listen, I felt safe with
you when you were three.

11:13.834 --> 11:18.367
And you always used to smell
from Midnight in Paris perfume.

11:18.867 --> 11:20.166
Better than this, huh?

11:21.767 --> 11:23.133
It sure was nice.

11:23.867 --> 11:25.200
It still is.

11:26.700 --> 11:29.967
-Good night, Ma.
-Good night, pussycat.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.100
(cymbals crashing, rock music playing)

11:41.700 --> 11:43.367
(rock music continues)

11:47.900 --> 11:49.900
What in the world
is going on here?

11:53.400 --> 11:56.133
David, I said, what in
the world is going on here?

11:56.200 --> 11:57.967
I thought you were in bed!

11:58.033 --> 12:00.367
I couldn't sleep,
so I went out and got a pizza.

12:00.433 --> 12:02.700
Made a few friends
and we decided to have a party.

12:02.767 --> 12:05.133
David, this is an inconvenience.

12:05.200 --> 12:09.033
I mean, it is 2 o'clock in the
morning. Now please, ask your...

12:12.633 --> 12:14.433
...friends to leave.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.967
Come on, girls.
Relax, loosen up!

12:18.033 --> 12:21.500
Hey, life's too short.
Especially for you guys.

12:21.567 --> 12:24.200
-David!
-I'll get the melon baller.

12:26.633 --> 12:28.400
Take it easy, ladies.

12:28.467 --> 12:30.633
Don't get your support hose
in a knot.

12:31.133 --> 12:33.867
That does it!
The party is over!

12:33.934 --> 12:35.600
Everybody out, out!

12:35.667 --> 12:37.767
Not you. Out!

12:37.834 --> 12:40.066
It's really been lovely.
And if anything is missing,

12:40.133 --> 12:43.100
I will give your names
to every narc in this city.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.233
Oh!

12:46.300 --> 12:48.834
David, clean up this mess,
then go to bed.

12:49.467 --> 12:51.467
Hey, why don't you clean
up the mess yourself?

12:52.100 --> 12:55.000
I mean, what's the big deal?
We were just having some fun.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.967
You know that those happen to be
my friends you just threw out?

12:58.800 --> 13:00.467
You know, this really stinks.

13:00.533 --> 13:02.834
What am I supposed to do
for the next two weeks,

13:02.900 --> 13:05.100
just sit around and listen
to your arteries harden?

13:05.166 --> 13:07.667
(gasps) You stop that!

13:07.734 --> 13:11.033
You know something? I am having
a real problem with your attitude!

13:11.100 --> 13:15.200
Oh, really? Well, you can
all just kiss my attitude!

13:15.266 --> 13:16.567
Ma.

13:21.233 --> 13:24.433
Well, you wouldn't let me get the
melon baller, so I improvised.

13:26.400 --> 13:29.400
Is that all you Italians know
how to do, scream and hit?

13:29.467 --> 13:33.000
No, we also know how to
make love and sing opera.

13:40.533 --> 13:42.667
Mom, you had no right to hit him.

13:43.266 --> 13:47.066
Oh, Blanche, I'm so sorry.
She should not have done that.

13:47.133 --> 13:49.166
Well, I have to go talk to David.

13:49.233 --> 13:51.033
I feel just awful about this.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.533
This is like
<i>The long day's journey into light.</i>

13:58.800 --> 14:01.667
-"Night," Rose.
-Night, Dorothy.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.867
David, are you all right?

14:13.500 --> 14:14.600
Yeah, I'm fine.

14:16.033 --> 14:17.934
It's just that nobody
ever hit me before.

14:20.633 --> 14:24.600
-I think I should go home.
-Oh, honey, you can't go home.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.934
There's nobody there
to take care of you.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.266
That's ok.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.767
I'd rather be there, alone,
than trapped here with you.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.734
Besides, I can take care of myself.

14:36.734 --> 14:38.066
I've been doing
it long enough.

14:39.367 --> 14:40.400
What do you mean?

14:41.166 --> 14:45.467
All mom and dad ever do is fight.
They don't even know I exist.

14:45.533 --> 14:48.333
Have you tried telling
them how you feel?

14:48.400 --> 14:50.033
They wouldn't listen.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.867
I'm listening.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.533
Yeah, only because they dumped me
on you and you feel you have to.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.333
-No, David.
-Well, you don't have to!

14:58.400 --> 14:59.867
Just leave me alone!

15:14.400 --> 15:17.000
"Trim the hedges, mow the lawn,
paint the patio furniture,

15:17.066 --> 15:20.400
wash the windows, clean out the
garage, scrub the denture cup."

15:20.900 --> 15:24.066
I added that. I hate doing it.

15:25.433 --> 15:27.400
This is too much.
I can't ask him to do this.

15:27.467 --> 15:28.633
Of course, you can.

15:28.700 --> 15:31.166
Idle hands are the
devil's workshop.

15:31.233 --> 15:33.300
God, I wish I'd said that.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.967
I don't see how doing all these
chores is gonna make him feel loved.

15:38.033 --> 15:41.400
Look, Blanche, the one thing
that David has never had

15:41.467 --> 15:43.400
in his life is structure.

15:43.467 --> 15:46.100
Now, doing chores will give him
a little responsibility.

15:46.166 --> 15:48.533
He might even start feeling
good about himself.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.233
And start hating me
if I ask him to do all this!

15:51.300 --> 15:54.333
Now, listen, Blanche,
you do what is best for David,

15:54.400 --> 15:56.767
not what is easiest for you.

15:56.834 --> 16:02.166
Yeah, we had chores on the farm...
boys and girls.

16:02.233 --> 16:04.867
And when we finished, we had such
a feeling of accomplishment.

16:04.934 --> 16:08.633
We had to feed the chickens,
slop the hogs, muck the stalls.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.333
Please, I'm trying to eat here!

16:11.700 --> 16:13.100
And after I finished all that,

16:13.166 --> 16:16.066
I still had to take care of Larry,
my one-eyed pig.

16:17.467 --> 16:20.867
What did you people do, run a
farm for handicapped animals?

16:24.934 --> 16:27.867
But you grew up in the country.
David's a city boy.

16:27.934 --> 16:29.700
Oh, wait now, Blanche,
come on.

16:29.767 --> 16:32.734
I'm from New York. I did chores.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.000
I made the beds,
I washed the dishes,

16:35.066 --> 16:37.533
scoured the pots,
cleaned the bathroom,

16:37.600 --> 16:39.533
folded the laundry,
took out the garbage.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.233
My, my. Did you attend
a military school?

16:43.233 --> 16:44.767
No, she lived with me.

16:46.233 --> 16:49.367
-Did they have chores in Sicily?
-Are you kidding?

16:49.433 --> 16:51.467
They invented chores in Sicily.

16:52.333 --> 16:55.633
Crossing the street without getting
pregnant was a chore in Sicily.

16:59.900 --> 17:04.000
-Rose, never mention Sicily.
-Oh...

17:04.066 --> 17:06.867
Well, I guess when I was little,
I didn't have to do anything.

17:07.533 --> 17:09.233
And I raised my daughter
the same way.

17:09.867 --> 17:12.433
So that's why David is the way
he is now, so it's all my fault!

17:12.500 --> 17:15.867
Oh, now, Blanche. You can't
blame yourself for David.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.533
You're right.
It's my mother's fault.

17:19.667 --> 17:22.433
I am gonna give this list to David
and see that he starts right away.

17:24.266 --> 17:26.967
How is it possible to get pregnant
in Sicily

17:27.033 --> 17:28.633
just by crossing the street?

17:32.600 --> 17:36.900
-Cheap chianti and narrow streets.
-Oh...

17:52.133 --> 17:54.934
if you wait a couple of minutes,
I'll make you some sandwiches.

17:58.667 --> 18:01.133
-Where you going?
-I don't know.

18:02.033 --> 18:03.500
How you getting there?

18:04.600 --> 18:06.233
-I'll take a bus.
-I see.

18:06.300 --> 18:09.133
And when the bus gets
to you-don't-know-where,

18:09.200 --> 18:10.333
what will you do then?

18:10.834 --> 18:11.767
Get a job.

18:11.834 --> 18:13.266
-Really?
-Yeah.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.266
As what, secretary of state?

18:17.233 --> 18:20.233
-I gotta go.
-So you're just gonna wimp out, huh?

18:20.300 --> 18:22.567
-I'm not wimping out.
-Well, what do you call this?

18:22.633 --> 18:26.066
Why should I stay here when
I got all this crappy stuff to do?

18:26.133 --> 18:27.533
And no one likes me anyway.

18:27.600 --> 18:31.667
You know, first of all, buddy boy,
life is full of crappy stuff to do.

18:31.734 --> 18:34.233
It's everywhere,
so you better get used to it.

18:34.300 --> 18:37.133
The President has
crappy stuff to do.

18:37.633 --> 18:41.333
Second of all, your grandmother
happens to like you.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.367
My mother likes you.

18:43.433 --> 18:47.233
She doesn't hit anyone unless she
really cares. Take it from me.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.400
And I happen to like you.

18:50.533 --> 18:53.500
-My life stinks.
-I know.

18:53.567 --> 18:57.433
Things are tough at home
and that really does stink.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.166
But you have a choice.

18:59.233 --> 19:02.000
You can tough it out,
or you can let it beat you.

19:02.734 --> 19:05.533
But right now you're here.
And this doesn't have to stink.

19:06.200 --> 19:10.166
And if you stay and work at it
and everything turns out,

19:10.233 --> 19:11.467
you'll have a place to visit

19:11.533 --> 19:14.333
when the things at home
really get to stink.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.800
I just can't, like,
come here whenever.

19:16.867 --> 19:19.633
You can just, like,
come here whenever.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.433
Well, I don't mind the gardening,

19:23.500 --> 19:26.033
but it's, like, the vacuuming
I hate.

19:26.100 --> 19:29.266
-That's, like, for girls.
-Well, we can renegotiate.

19:29.333 --> 19:33.166
I'll do the vacuuming
if you'll, like, learn English.

19:36.266 --> 19:38.734
Come on,
I'll fix you something to eat.

19:42.834 --> 19:44.467
All right, now, attention, everyone.

19:44.533 --> 19:46.567
I want to propose a toast.

19:46.633 --> 19:50.166
To Dorothy Zbornak, who got
an A in her French class,

19:50.233 --> 19:52.533
proving that you can
teach an old dog new tricks.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.700
-And if anyone knows about tricks...
-Ma!

20:00.266 --> 20:03.133
Thank you,
ladies and gentleman.

20:03.200 --> 20:06.800
Or should I say,
<i>merci beaucoup, mes amies.</i>

20:06.867 --> 20:10.000
Oh, my, that was impressive!

20:10.066 --> 20:13.533
Jane Goodall once taught an ape
to rumba, that's impressive!

20:14.800 --> 20:17.633
Now I would like
to propose a toast.

20:17.700 --> 20:20.467
To David, who in the past week

20:20.533 --> 20:23.934
has proven that he
is one damn good kid.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.400
Hear, hear.

20:27.333 --> 20:30.367
You know,
it's really been interesting.

20:30.433 --> 20:34.400
I got hit, did chores, learned
all about handicapped animals.

20:36.266 --> 20:39.333
All in all, it hasn't been half-bad.

20:41.400 --> 20:44.967
And if it's all right with you, I
wouldn't mind living here full-time.

20:50.767 --> 20:54.133
Well, I would certainly have to
discuss that with your parents.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.900
Oh, mom and dad will say yes.

20:55.967 --> 20:58.066
They'll be as happy
with the idea as I am.

20:59.166 --> 21:01.934
Well, I'm gonna
get some ice cream.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.266
Wait up! I'll show you where
I hide the good stuff.

21:05.266 --> 21:07.400
Call his mother!

21:09.867 --> 21:11.000
Blanche,
what are we gonna do?

21:11.066 --> 21:12.834
Do you think
I should call his mother?

21:12.900 --> 21:14.500
I really think you should.

21:14.567 --> 21:16.667
All right, I will.

21:17.166 --> 21:20.166
I don't want to send him
back to an unhappy home,

21:20.233 --> 21:21.800
but we're grandmothers.

21:21.867 --> 21:25.467
It wouldn't be fair to be this old
and have to raise children.

21:25.533 --> 21:27.934
Hello, baby, it's Mama.

21:28.700 --> 21:30.567
Well, I'm fine, honey.
I'm just fine.

21:30.633 --> 21:32.166
I'm calling you about David.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.000
No, he's fine.

21:35.066 --> 21:37.367
Matter of fact, he's so
happy here, Janet,

21:37.433 --> 21:40.166
that I've decided to keep him
and raise him myself.

21:42.133 --> 21:43.433
You heard me.

21:44.300 --> 21:46.967
Well, he says that you and Michael
spend so much time arguing,

21:47.033 --> 21:48.567
that you don't have time for him.

21:50.567 --> 21:52.333
Don't you take that
tone with me, missy.

21:54.100 --> 21:55.900
Yes, I realize you're his mother--

21:58.667 --> 22:00.233
No, I don't suppose I can stop you

22:00.300 --> 22:02.300
if you insist on coming
and getting him.

22:02.367 --> 22:05.700
But you let me tell you this, if
you and Michael don't straighten up

22:05.767 --> 22:08.433
and give that boy the love
and attention he deserves,

22:08.500 --> 22:11.834
I will kick your uppity butt
till hell won't have it again!

22:17.400 --> 22:20.233
She'll call us right back.
She has to wake up the yankee.

22:21.100 --> 22:25.266
-Well done, Blanche.
-Oh, absolutely. Nice bluff.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.800
That was no bluff.
I meant every word of it.

22:27.867 --> 22:30.367
I would love to have
a chance to raise David.

22:30.433 --> 22:32.700
I might make up for the mess
I made with Janet.

22:40.900 --> 22:43.433
I still wish you'd let us
drive you to the airport.

22:43.500 --> 22:47.066
Oh, my cab's already here. Besides,
I've seen the way you all drive!

22:47.133 --> 22:49.033
Oh!

22:50.066 --> 22:51.333
I'm gonna miss you guys.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.400
It was nice of your folks
to let you join them in Hawaii.

22:54.467 --> 22:57.367
Yeah, they've never ignored me
on an island before.

22:57.433 --> 22:59.133
David, you listen to me.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.367
Now, they want the three of you
to start over from scratch,

23:01.433 --> 23:03.433
so the least you can do
is meet them halfway.

23:03.934 --> 23:05.000
I'll try.

23:05.066 --> 23:06.900
I bet it'll be easier
than you think.

23:06.967 --> 23:09.567
Yeah, especially now that
you have an alternative.

23:09.633 --> 23:10.900
If things get too tough at home,

23:10.967 --> 23:13.033
you can always come here
and live with us.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.734
(car horn)

23:15.500 --> 23:17.166
-Well...
-Bye, Grandma.

23:17.233 --> 23:19.066
Bye, honey.

23:19.633 --> 23:21.633
-Dorothy.
-Bye, love.

23:23.667 --> 23:24.834
Rose.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.900
See ya, slugger.

23:39.066 --> 23:41.734
Bye, darling. Bye.

23:41.800 --> 23:44.200
Run, run, run!
Go.

23:47.700 --> 23:49.233
Oh, I hope
he's gonna be all right.

23:50.767 --> 23:53.734
Oh, Dorothy,
that was so sweet of you,

23:53.800 --> 23:55.700
telling him he could come live
with us.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.300
I meant it.

23:57.367 --> 23:59.633
It's gonna be awfully quiet
around here without him.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.166
I'll say. No more listening
to Dorothy snore!

24:03.433 --> 24:05.333
Ma, I do not snore!

24:05.400 --> 24:06.934
Please, I had to turn you
from the window

24:07.000 --> 24:08.533
so you wouldn't inhale
the drapes!
