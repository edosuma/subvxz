You've become vain! Remember
what's important to you!

09:31.571 --> 09:34.306
What means more to you than
anything else?

09:34.340 --> 09:36.476
Yes, remember your family!

09:36.509 --> 09:38.644
No, food!
Remember food!

You join us here as a local hero
has put out a house fire

10:16.749 --> 10:18.984
without the aid of our useless
fire department.

10:19.018 --> 10:20.520
Who needs firemen anyway?

10:20.553 --> 10:23.055
I'm sorry, kids.
I guess I went a bit too far.

10:23.088 --> 10:25.791
Let me make it up to you.
Who wants pizza?

10:25.825 --> 10:27.860
And after that,
we can go for Mexican.

10:27.893 --> 10:30.029
And after that,
we can go for Chinese.

10:30.062 --> 10:33.365
Oh, and we should get a burrito,
too, and maybe some ice cream.

10:33.399 --> 10:36.902
You know what? I could also
really go for a taco right now.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.938
There's this place I know where
they toast the tacos first,

10:38.971 --> 10:40.573
then maybe a burger.
