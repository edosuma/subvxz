00:55.367 --> 00:59.800
(TV playing)

01:10.867 --> 01:13.700
-What are you doing?
-Watching <i>Amazing Discoveries.</i>

01:13.767 --> 01:15.133
Look at that.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.767
The thing just shucks
the corn off the cob.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.533
Just shucks it off.

01:22.333 --> 01:25.066
I cannot watch you
spend one more night like this.

01:25.133 --> 01:27.300
You're coming with me
to the Rusty Anchor.

01:27.367 --> 01:31.400
Blanche, I told you,
I am so uncomfortable with strangers.

01:31.467 --> 01:34.934
Now, now. Don't blame yourself.
They're just as uncomfortable with you.

01:36.867 --> 01:39.433
It all stems from your low self-esteem.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.767
What?

01:40.834 --> 01:44.166
If you felt better about yourself,
you'd get out more.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.967
I have a little exercise I do
whenever my self-esteem's kinda low.

01:48.033 --> 01:51.967
I say my name, and then I list
three positive things about myself.

01:52.033 --> 01:54.767
I'm Blanche Devereaux, I'm beautiful,

01:54.834 --> 01:58.300
men find me desirable,
and people wanna be my friend.

01:58.367 --> 02:00.333
-Go on now, you try.
-Oh, Blanche.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.500
Please. Please.

02:02.467 --> 02:05.066
I'm Dorothy Zbornak, I'm beautiful,

02:05.133 --> 02:09.633
men find me desirable,
and people want to be my friend.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.233
Sorry, I confused you, honey,

02:14.300 --> 02:16.967
you're supposed to say
three positive things that apply to you.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.133
You know, like, you could say,
"I'm Dorothy Zbornak,

02:23.200 --> 02:24.934
I'm a good speller...

02:25.000 --> 02:29.734
and I'm, uh, I'm very prompt...
and, um..."

02:29.800 --> 02:33.233
Well, actually there's no law
that says there has to be three.

02:34.533 --> 02:37.333
Actually, I just thought of a third one.

02:37.867 --> 02:41.100
I can snap a friend's neck like a twig.

02:43.533 --> 02:44.767
There we go.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.900
Oh, girls.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.200
We just went to
Doug Kirkpatrick's wake.

02:50.266 --> 02:51.567
It was the greatest.

02:51.633 --> 02:55.233
I can't remember when I had such fun.
Those Irishmen.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.767
They even laid out Doug's body
in the living room.

02:58.233 --> 03:00.433
Oh, that sounds morbid.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.834
I didn't have a problem with it
till one of the relatives got drunk

03:03.900 --> 03:06.433
and started slow dancing with the corpse.

03:09.633 --> 03:12.100
But even then, it was surprisingly
touching.

03:13.033 --> 03:17.633
And speaking of being touched, it's nickel
beer night at the Rusty Anchor.

03:17.700 --> 03:18.967
I'll get my purse.

03:19.033 --> 03:23.533
-You get changed 'cause we're going.
-What if no one wants to talk to me?

03:23.600 --> 03:25.600
What if nobody asks me to dance?

03:25.667 --> 03:27.000
Now, Dorothy, think.

03:27.066 --> 03:30.200
If there's somebody out there
willing to dance with a corpse,

03:30.266 --> 03:32.266
there's somebody willing to dance
with you.

03:32.867 --> 03:36.734
(serene music playing)

03:36.800 --> 03:41.266
Blanche, wait, wait, wait.
Maybe this wasn't a good idea.

03:41.333 --> 03:44.266
Nonsense.
I promise you'll have a good time.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.667
You'll introduce me to some of your
friends?

03:46.734 --> 03:49.300
Yes, if I see anybody I know.

03:50.333 --> 03:53.934
-Blanche! Blanche! Blanche!
-Hi, everybody!

03:54.266 --> 03:59.000
-Hey, Blanche, how's life?
-Well, it's a dog-eat-dog world,

03:59.066 --> 04:02.900
-but I'm wearing no underwear.
-Yeah! Yeah! Yay!

04:05.433 --> 04:08.100
Hi, everybody. Hi, Frank.

04:08.166 --> 04:11.233
Hey, boys, I want you to meet
my best friend Dorothy.

04:11.300 --> 04:16.567
Dorothy, this is Frank, Alan, and Paul.
You boys show her a good time.

04:16.633 --> 04:19.266
I would, but I want to have one myself.

04:19.333 --> 04:21.233
-Oh...
-Oh...

04:28.467 --> 04:31.600
You're...
you're a little uncomfortable, aren't you?

04:35.367 --> 04:37.266
Uh... to be...

04:37.934 --> 04:42.333
to be honest,
I'm not really, uh, into the bar scene.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.066
I... I sense you're not, either.

04:47.600 --> 04:52.266
I guess the problem is
to make that human connection, you know,

04:52.333 --> 04:53.734
with the...

05:02.834 --> 05:04.400
hi.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.700
I haven't seen you here before.

05:06.767 --> 05:09.834
I usually don't come to places like this.

05:09.900 --> 05:13.700
Well, I can understand.
Many people feel uncomfortable in a bar.

05:19.166 --> 05:21.166
Yes, I can see that.

05:26.633 --> 05:28.967
(humming)

05:29.033 --> 05:31.266
You don't happen to sing, do you?

05:31.767 --> 05:35.467
What makes you think I sing
or would even want to?

05:35.900 --> 05:39.633
I mean, some people might enjoy
making fools of themselves in public,

05:39.700 --> 05:43.400
but, uh, me sing? I... I don't think so.

05:43.467 --> 05:45.333
-You sing.
-A little, yes.

05:46.266 --> 05:51.967
Great. Uh, how about some Irving Berlin?
"Blue Skies, always".

05:52.767 --> 05:55.867
-Maybe... maybe some other time.
-What'll I do?

05:55.934 --> 05:57.467
"D" flat is good for me.

07:51.600 --> 07:56.300
(mellow music playing)

07:58.867 --> 08:03.066
Blanche, I wanted to thank you again
for last night.

08:03.133 --> 08:05.934
Hmm? Oh, yeah. Sure. No problem.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.400
You still haven't said anything
about my performance.

08:09.467 --> 08:12.233
That little ditty you croaked out?
It was cute.

08:14.867 --> 08:15.900
Dorothy...

08:16.400 --> 08:18.600
how'd you like to go to a wake next
Friday?

08:19.133 --> 08:21.834
You know how I feel about those things.

08:21.900 --> 08:25.033
They're so sad and depressing.
Whose wake is it?

08:25.100 --> 08:26.900
-Mine.
-What time?

08:28.033 --> 08:29.633
No. She's serious.

08:29.700 --> 08:33.233
Next Friday, Sophia's going to
throw her own wake.

08:33.300 --> 08:34.700
Food, drinks, music.

08:34.767 --> 08:38.300
The only difference will be she'll be
alive... God willing.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.700
What... what are you talking about?

08:43.767 --> 08:47.900
At Doug's wake, people got up and said
wonderful things about him,

08:47.967 --> 08:49.834
but he wasn't there to hear it.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.700
I don't want that to happen to me.

08:52.033 --> 08:58.400
I want to hear how people feel about me
as they salute my grace, my wit,

08:58.467 --> 09:01.633
-my inner beauty.
-Ma, writers cost money.

09:04.400 --> 09:08.333
This whole idea's twisted.
Come on. You'll be around for years.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.133
There's no reason for anybody to say
goodbye to you.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.000
Dorothy, I want this.

09:13.066 --> 09:14.867
There's nothing you can do to stop me.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.533
You won't prevent me
from having the wake of my dreams.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.133
I'm not paying for it.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.533
Okay, a kitten. Can I have a kitten?

09:24.000 --> 09:27.467
I'll be happy to pay for your wake.
I love you.

09:27.533 --> 09:30.900
-Well, me, too.
-Well, fine. Fine. Do what you want.

09:30.967 --> 09:33.400
Just don't expect me to be a part of it.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.166
I even know a way we can save money.

09:37.233 --> 09:40.100
-I'll make the hors d'oeuvres.
-Some wake.

09:41.066 --> 09:43.367
Scandinavian crap on a cracker.

09:45.467 --> 09:47.400
I mean, thank you.

09:48.367 --> 09:52.300

09:57.100 --> 09:59.433

Blanche, Blanche, Blanche...

10:05.367 --> 10:10.133
-It's a bosun's knot, all right.
-(all) Yeah! Yay!

10:10.200 --> 10:15.533
Now, for my encore, ahem, ahem,
the star of David.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.667
-Oh!
-Hey! It's Dorothy!

10:19.266 --> 10:23.800
-Hi, everybody!
-Dorothy, glad to see you again!

10:23.867 --> 10:27.000
-Hi. How are you?
-Let me buy you a drink.

10:27.066 --> 10:29.734
-I want to buy her a drink.
-I asked her first.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.934
Come on. Boys, boys.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.367
I am woman enough for all of you.

10:34.433 --> 10:37.033
Oh! Oh! Oh!

10:37.633 --> 10:40.500
This is the point in my dream
where I usually wake up screaming.

10:40.567 --> 10:42.567
What are you doing here?

10:42.633 --> 10:45.233
On the way to the Laundromat,

10:45.300 --> 10:47.834
I happened to pass by
and thought I'd drop in.

10:47.900 --> 10:50.633
Well, uh, you going to sing for us,
Dorothy?

10:50.700 --> 10:51.667
-Come on.
-Yeah.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.400
-No. I'm not prepared.
-You got to sing.

10:54.467 --> 10:58.567
-I wouldn't know what to do.
-Hey. She said she's not prepared.

10:58.633 --> 11:02.300
-There's no use asking.
-Will you look what I found? Sheet music.

11:02.367 --> 11:04.567
Hey, Dorothy!

11:04.633 --> 11:07.500
-Okay come on down to the piano.
-Come on.

11:07.567 --> 11:11.734
Hey, wait. I have a much better idea.
Let's all conga!

11:11.800 --> 11:12.800
Later, Blanche.

11:12.867 --> 11:16.367
-We want to hear Dorothy sing.

Excuse me. I couldn't help noticing

12:15.066 --> 12:18.266
you took several of my tasty, delicious
lutefisk puffs,

12:18.333 --> 12:19.800
and you've hardly touched them.

12:19.867 --> 12:22.367
Uh, I just don't care for them.

Yeah, well, that's an ugly hat.

12:30.066 --> 12:33.000
Rose, nobody's having a good time.
It's supposed to be a party.

12:33.066 --> 12:36.600
Maybe when Sophia makes her entrance,
it'll perk things up.

12:37.233 --> 12:39.767

You're just the person we need

you're good at.

I didn't even know she was sick.

-Wait. Don't tell me.

13:05.867 --> 13:08.700
Uh, Claus von Bülow? Huh?

13:12.834 --> 13:14.900
I'm talking about Sophia.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.700
How did she die?

13:16.767 --> 13:20.567
What do you mean, how did she...
excuse me.

13:23.100 --> 13:26.900
Rose, listen, I want you to think now
very carefully.

13:27.667 --> 13:29.467
When you sent out those invitations,

13:29.533 --> 13:32.867
you did remember to tell everyone
Sophia's really alive, didn't you?

13:33.700 --> 13:34.834
Blanche.

13:35.500 --> 13:38.333
I'm offended. How dumb do you think I am?

13:38.934 --> 13:40.266
I put it...

13:42.500 --> 13:45.333
I made the freaking hors d'oeuvres.
Leave me alone.

13:47.734 --> 13:51.133
Rose, you idiot.
Everybody thinks she's dead now.

13:51.567 --> 13:55.000
-We've to tell them the truth before--
-Hey, everyone.

13:55.567 --> 13:57.033
-Oh! Aah!
-(gasps)

13:57.100 --> 14:00.633
Thanks for coming to my wake.
Do you like the dress?

14:00.700 --> 14:02.300
Oh, my God.

14:05.433 --> 14:07.900
Well, excuse me for buying off the rack.

14:09.100 --> 14:13.166
Sophia, is it really you?
You're supposed to be dead.

14:13.233 --> 14:14.467
Hold that thought.

14:15.533 --> 14:19.233
Rose, you forgot to tell these people
I was alive, didn't you?

14:19.300 --> 14:23.200
And I made the freaking punch,
and I made the freaking decorations!

14:24.100 --> 14:27.433
What is this, some kind of sick joke?

14:30.166 --> 14:32.433
All right, everybody. Now just stop.

14:32.734 --> 14:35.734
Okay, so there's been a little
misunderstanding,

14:35.800 --> 14:37.867
but the point is you're all here...

14:38.233 --> 14:41.567
and you were invited to celebrate
Sophia's life

14:41.633 --> 14:44.233
and the wonderful times you've shared.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.500
And the good news is
that Sophia's still with us,

14:47.567 --> 14:50.967
so now you can tell her
how you really feel about her.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.734
I'll go first.

14:55.200 --> 14:59.867
Sophia, I drove 30 miles and missed a day
of work just to be here.

15:00.166 --> 15:03.266
I think it's very selfish of you
not to be dead.

15:03.900 --> 15:04.967
(woman) Yeah.

15:05.567 --> 15:06.767
And I missed...

15:07.066 --> 15:12.333
Well, actually, I didn't have anything
planned for today, but I'm still P.O.'d.

15:16.734 --> 15:18.734
Oh, I'm so sorry, Sophia.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.000
But the important thing is they came,

15:21.066 --> 15:24.767
and when they thought you were dead,
they were real sad.

15:24.834 --> 15:26.300
I guess you're right.

15:26.367 --> 15:29.367
I still wish my wake hadn't been
such a disaster.

15:29.433 --> 15:32.800
Look on the bright side.
You'll have another one.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.200
(serene music playing)

15:36.266 --> 15:39.800
-Dorothy! Dorothy!
-Hi, everybody!

15:39.867 --> 15:43.467
-Hey, Dorothy, what's your pleasure?
-Claude Akins on a waterbed.

15:45.300 --> 15:47.934
Until then, a beer will have to do.

15:48.467 --> 15:50.800
-Hey, guys, what about me?
-Blanche!

15:50.867 --> 15:53.000
-That's better.
-Shut the door.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.633
See? What did I tell you?

15:58.100 --> 16:00.300
That's why I wanted you
to come see for yourself.

16:00.367 --> 16:01.367
Look at that.

16:01.433 --> 16:06.033
The men are practically swarming all over
her just like she was somebody.

16:07.033 --> 16:10.667
I just have to keep reminding myself
I am Blanche Devereaux.

16:10.734 --> 16:14.133
I am beautiful,
men find me desirable...

16:14.600 --> 16:16.266
and my life is over.

16:17.734 --> 16:20.867
Boy, when the mask falls off
it really makes a thud.

16:22.700 --> 16:25.834
-Come on, Dorothy. Sing something.
-Come on. Sing something for us.

16:26.767 --> 16:28.166
Something wrong, Sophia?

16:29.033 --> 16:30.266
I don't believe it.

16:30.333 --> 16:31.934
My Dorothy is popular.

16:32.333 --> 16:35.834
After 60 years of bargaining with God,
it's finally happened.

16:37.266 --> 16:40.533
Per our agreement,
I'm off to Calcutta to work with the poor.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.967
Well, I for one have had it
with Ms. Dorothy Zbornak.

16:48.767 --> 16:51.767
I'm going to get this bar's attention
if it's the last thing I do.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.367
Do what you did last night.

16:54.433 --> 16:58.100
-Hey, fellas. What's going on?
-Hi, Blanche. Sit down.

16:58.166 --> 16:59.633
Dorothy's about to sing for us.

16:59.700 --> 17:03.066
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe I'd like to sing?

17:04.100 --> 17:06.567
Come on, Blanche.
You've been coming here seven years.

17:06.633 --> 17:08.834
The only thing you've done
on that piano is--

17:08.900 --> 17:12.633
-Hey. There's a lady present.
-Thank you.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.400
Everybody...

17:14.900 --> 17:16.967
may I have your attention, please?

17:17.033 --> 17:19.033
Two can play at this game, you know.

17:19.367 --> 17:20.533
Boys...

17:21.333 --> 17:23.433
I have a little surprise for you.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.900
Yeah, yeah. We know.
You're not wearing a bra.

17:27.867 --> 17:29.367
No, no.

17:30.266 --> 17:34.233
-I'm going to sing.
-(all) Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:34.300 --> 17:36.667
Would you, please? Thank you.

17:41.600 --> 17:46.333
For all my... special friends
here at the Rusty Anchor...

17:47.033 --> 17:48.400
this one's for you.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.333

His name's Don,
and he just had hip surgery.

19:02.900 --> 19:05.400
Oh. Oh. I'm sorry.

19:07.967 --> 19:09.033
Well.

19:09.533 --> 19:11.533
Hello, big boy.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.767

or are you just happy to see me?

20:07.667 --> 20:11.266
Two Jews, an Arab,
and a priest walk into a bar...

20:11.834 --> 20:15.300
(mellow music playing)

20:15.367 --> 20:18.000
I don't understand
what you're so upset about.

20:18.066 --> 20:21.000
The Rusty Anchor is my place, not yours.

20:21.066 --> 20:23.734
Blanche, you begged me
to come down here.

20:23.800 --> 20:27.667
-You told me to get a life.
-Well, I didn't mean mine.

20:29.333 --> 20:32.934
I didn't know you'd come in here
and take my place away.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.700
I would never do that to you, Dorothy.

20:35.767 --> 20:38.433
Do you see me going down
to sing at the library?

20:38.867 --> 20:40.033
Well, do you?

20:41.200 --> 20:42.200
Blanche, I'm...

20:42.667 --> 20:44.834
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

20:46.033 --> 20:47.600
All right. The truth is...

20:50.533 --> 20:52.100
I'm jealous of you.

20:52.633 --> 20:55.333
Oh, God, that leaves
a bad taste in my mouth.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.834
Blanche, what are you talking about?

20:58.900 --> 21:01.367
The one thing I've always
been assured of

21:01.433 --> 21:02.900
is being the center of attention.

21:02.967 --> 21:05.667
I knew I never had to worry
about competing with another woman

21:05.734 --> 21:07.934
'cause I'd always win...

21:08.033 --> 21:10.967
but when I saw you sing the other night...

21:11.467 --> 21:16.066
I realized why all those men were
practically falling all over themselves

21:16.133 --> 21:17.133
to get to you...

21:18.200 --> 21:20.100
because, Dorothy, when you sing...

21:21.000 --> 21:23.233
you light up the room. You do.

21:23.800 --> 21:27.800
You positively glow.
You just... you're beautiful.

21:27.867 --> 21:31.000
Oh...
Blanche, you don't have to say that.

21:31.066 --> 21:32.734
Believe me, I don't like saying it.

21:34.600 --> 21:35.800
But it's true.

21:35.867 --> 21:40.600
You can attract men in a way I can't,
and I'm jealous of you.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.700
Blanche Devereaux,

21:42.767 --> 21:46.433
that is the nicest thing
you have ever said to me.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.033
-It is?
-Absolutely.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.867
Yeah. You're probably right.

21:51.934 --> 21:54.900
Most of the time when I compliment you,
I'm not being sincere.

21:55.333 --> 21:58.100
But I really meant that last one. I swear.

21:58.633 --> 21:59.800
Look, Blanche...

22:00.066 --> 22:03.367
the Rusty Anchor isn't worth risking
our friendship over.

22:03.433 --> 22:05.433
If you want me to stop coming,
just say so.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.367
I want you to stop coming here.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.967
Like hell I will.

22:10.834 --> 22:12.300
Then what are we going to do?

22:13.367 --> 22:14.633
Why don't we share?

22:14.700 --> 22:18.433
Let's just be sure
we don't show up on the same night.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.667
Like I'd come three nights a week,
and you'd come three?

22:21.734 --> 22:24.333
Right. Wait a minute.
What about Sunday?

22:24.400 --> 22:28.867
You don't want to come on a Sunday.
The men have been watching football.

22:28.934 --> 22:30.133
They're drunk and rowdy.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.867
-You want Sundays, don't you?
-Please.

22:34.967 --> 22:38.900
-It's a deal.
-Oh, Dorothy.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.100
Dorothy, are you...

22:46.700 --> 22:48.166
ever jealous of me?

22:49.233 --> 22:50.934
Every day of my life.

22:52.700 --> 22:56.000
Blanche, why don't we go out there
and do a duet?

22:57.100 --> 23:00.200
-Do you know "Cry Me A River"?
-Oh, no, I don't.

23:00.800 --> 23:03.300
Good. We'll do that one. Come on.
