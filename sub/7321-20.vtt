00:01.334 --> 00:02.926
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

00:02.969 --> 00:05.301
Izzie has stage four melanoma

00:05.338 --> 00:07.829
that has spread to her brain,
liver and skin.

00:07.874 --> 00:10.342
He threw the first punch.
I should talk to him?

00:10.377 --> 00:12.641
- Mr. Torres.
- She's my only little girl.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.977
- The minute you hurt her...
- I'm engaged.

00:15.048 --> 00:16.640
I broke up with Owen.

00:22.055 --> 00:24.819
<i>Defeat isn't an option.</i>

00:27.027 --> 00:28.892
<i>Not for surgeons.</i>

00:29.929 --> 00:33.660
<i>We don't back away from the table</i>
<i>till the last breath's long gone.</i>

00:35.869 --> 00:38.133
<i>"Terminal's" a challenge.</i>

00:41.441 --> 00:45.070
<i>"Life threatening" is</i>
<i>what gets us out of bed in the morning.</i>

01:06.966 --> 01:09.264
<i>We're not easily intimidated.</i>

01:11.171 --> 01:12.729
<i>We don't flinch,</i>

01:13.940 --> 01:15.601
<i>we don't back down...</i>

01:18.111 --> 01:20.511
<i>...and we certainly don't surrender.</i>

01:31.491 --> 01:33.015
<i>Not at work, anyway.</i>

01:35.595 --> 01:38.029
Does it bother you
that I don't wanna wear it?

01:38.064 --> 01:41.761
- Because I... I could.
- I don't want you to wear it.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.359
You're not a ring bride.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.362
What?

01:46.406 --> 01:49.671
I'm not really a church wedding bride,

01:49.709 --> 01:52.940
or a poufy white dress bride either.

01:52.979 --> 01:56.005
We'll get naked and get married
in a field of flowers.

01:57.417 --> 02:00.750
- I'm not a naked bride!
- We'll get married in scrubs.

02:00.787 --> 02:04.382
- Ooh! There's a wedding I can get into.
- We gotta go.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.124
So I told Izzie she could help
with the wedding,

02:09.162 --> 02:12.859
keeps her mind off of everything. I'll
tell her about the scrubs and no church.

02:12.899 --> 02:14.526
simplicity.

02:18.438 --> 02:22.238
Maybe they can make you a bouquet
of scalpels and clamps.

02:22.275 --> 02:25.369
That would be fun.
I'd have to run it by Izzie first.

02:44.030 --> 02:46.464
I don't feel anything.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.989
Nothing?

02:48.067 --> 02:53.699
No anger, happiness, unhappiness?

02:53.740 --> 02:55.105
Guilt?

02:56.075 --> 02:58.009
Survivor's guilt?

03:00.113 --> 03:03.947
- It's very common with veterans.
- It's not about my platoon.

03:06.653 --> 03:09.588
You have shoved your feelings
aside for so long.

03:10.223 --> 03:12.020
I'm asking you to claim them.

03:12.859 --> 03:16.852
And Owen, this is about your platoon.

03:16.896 --> 03:20.696
It's about the fact that I tried
to choke my girlfriend to death.

03:21.868 --> 03:25.395
The way I feel about my platoon and what
happened with Cristina are the same?

03:25.438 --> 03:26.496
They're not.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.633
How will you know
if you can't name those feelings.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.143
That's not what it's...

03:32.645 --> 03:33.669
It's...

03:36.049 --> 03:37.414
I don't know.

03:37.450 --> 03:41.216
What do you mean you don't
deliver dresses? Just to try on?

03:41.254 --> 03:45.520
No, no, I can't come in.
I... have cancer.

03:45.592 --> 03:47.719
I'm bed-bound and dying.

03:53.700 --> 03:56.533
Fabulous! I'll fax you my choices. Hi!

03:56.569 --> 03:59.436
Uh, what do you need?
Blood, pee, what can I get you?

03:59.472 --> 04:01.997
Just checking in on you,
see how the chemo's sitting.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.975
Fine. I haven't puked yet.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.535
- I'm making progress on Mer's wedding.
- You should take it easy.

04:07.614 --> 04:10.879
- Chemo's gonna take a lot out of you.
- I'll let you know if I hit the wall.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.851
Hello? Hi, yes. I wanted
to discuss, um, flower arrangements.

04:13.886 --> 04:18.949
She needs to save her energy. This
isn't just chemo. It's high dose IL-2.

04:18.992 --> 04:23.452
It makes the body attack itself. She's
walking around, but it's not gonna last.

04:23.496 --> 04:26.954
Blood pressure will tank,
shaking with chills, nauseous.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.093
She might even have a heart attack.

04:31.237 --> 04:34.764
Believe me, a few hours from now,

04:34.807 --> 04:37.742
Izzie Stevens is gonna
wish she were dead.

04:48.421 --> 04:51.481
- Is he here yet?
- Talking about Calliope's dad?

04:51.524 --> 04:54.493
The answer is I don't know
because I'm not meeting him

04:54.527 --> 04:58.088
- because it's way too soon.
- And Torres is OK with that?

04:58.131 --> 05:01.589
Her idea. The man's here for one day,
then he's gone. No muss, no fuss.

05:08.074 --> 05:11.373
- Run. Run for your life.
- What do you mean "run for my life"?

05:11.411 --> 05:14.278
- Oh, God! Dad!
- Give me one good reason

05:14.314 --> 05:16.373
- I shouldn't kill you.
- Stop it!

05:16.416 --> 05:19.283
- You committed adultery.
- Who hasn't?! I slept with him

05:19.352 --> 05:22.810
before we were divorced, so
George isn't the only one who cheated.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.392
Good God!

05:28.428 --> 05:30.794
Give me one reason
I shouldn't kill you.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.856
- Mark Sloan. Pleasure to meet you.
- Dad, Mark's just a friend.

05:35.034 --> 05:39.232
I'm happy, OK? I'm dating someone now
and I'm happy, OK?

05:45.745 --> 05:48.236
You're dating again.
That's good, healthy.

05:48.281 --> 05:51.614
I'd like to meet
this new gentleman suitor.

05:52.318 --> 05:54.650
Yeah. Yeah, no, um...

05:54.687 --> 05:59.090
They're pretty busy 'cause they're a
doctor here, but, um, you'll love them.

05:59.125 --> 06:02.026
You'll love them because
they're smart and funny, and...

06:02.061 --> 06:06.657
...both handsome and, and beautiful
and, and very supportive.

06:08.067 --> 06:11.434
Daddy? Please be OK with this.

06:19.412 --> 06:23.246
Dad, this is Arizona Robbins.

06:23.282 --> 06:25.079
This is who I'm dating now.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.346
I really hope you draw the line
at throwing women against walls.

06:31.023 --> 06:33.583
- You page me?
- Driver's face went through window.

06:33.626 --> 06:35.457
- Your cup of tea.
- Right you are.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.730
- What do you got?
- Anthony Meloy, 32-year-old male

06:40.767 --> 06:44.703
pedestrian with a left arm injury
and road rash to his face and torso.

06:44.737 --> 06:48.036
Stable vitals. Landed on the street
after he was hit by the driver.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.871
I didn't hit him.
He jumped in front of me!

06:49.909 --> 06:52.207
Dan Gates. Swerved
after he didn't hit Mr. Meloy

06:52.245 --> 06:55.703
and sideswiped a pole.
Complains of abdominal pain.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.876
- Blood from his left ear...
- He came out of nowhere!

06:58.918 --> 07:01.819
Give him a blood alcohol test.
Driving like a madman!

07:01.854 --> 07:04.482
- Now he's just lying.
- I'm lying? I'm lying?!

07:04.524 --> 07:06.583
- Try to stay still.
- No sign of head trauma.

07:06.626 --> 07:09.561
Check out the other guy.
I got it from here. Let's go.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.155
- I need to look at his injuries.
- When we're inside.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.564
- Drunk!
- Liar!

07:14.600 --> 07:16.625
- Pathetic.
- Ass.

07:26.145 --> 07:27.635
I was just driving to the bank.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.877
Next thing, this guy
jumped in front of my car. Whack job.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.477
- Can you move your eyebrow?
- I can't examine his ear.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.885
- Would you get out of the way?
- Just wait.

07:37.790 --> 07:41.021
Free fluid in the upper quadrant.
Grey, schedule a stat CT.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.089
How you doing, Mr. Meloy?

07:47.133 --> 07:50.227
- My arm's killing me, otherwise fine.
- Tenderness and bruising

07:50.269 --> 07:53.568
- over his humerus, but good pulses.
- We should still do a full work-up.

07:53.606 --> 07:58.043
Check in with Karev once you assess,
let him know what you find.

07:58.077 --> 08:01.774
- I'm reporting to Karev?
- He's overseeing the pit today.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.645
- You good with that, Karev?
- Yes, sir.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.651
I'll be in the OR if you need me.

08:07.086 --> 08:08.781
Off you go.

08:10.256 --> 08:13.748
Meeting Callie's dad
was so not on the agenda for today.

08:13.793 --> 08:15.920
Seems like a man
who needs preparation

08:15.995 --> 08:19.556
for meeting his daughter's girlfriend.
Should have seen his face.

08:19.599 --> 08:21.726
- Can you stop doing that thing?
- What thing?

08:21.767 --> 08:23.928
Telling me your business thing.
It's my day off.

08:23.970 --> 08:26.768
- I'm here to watch the fundoplication.
- I checked.

08:26.806 --> 08:30.071
You worked a 90 hour week.
You should be sleeping.

08:30.109 --> 08:33.635
- You can stop doing that, too.
- It's just that Peds can be tough.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.977
- It can be hard on a family.
- Not mine.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.712
My husband... is very supportive.

08:39.751 --> 08:43.051
He is... can't wait for me
to start my fellowship.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.751
- He doesn't know, does he?
- No.

08:45.791 --> 08:47.725
Why?

08:47.760 --> 08:50.388
Dr. Robbins, Jessica had a seizure
and can't breathe.

08:50.429 --> 08:55.230
She's got Tay-Sachs. Get a mask on her
and crank it up to 15 liters.

08:56.769 --> 08:58.669
All right, sit up.
You're OK, honey.

08:59.906 --> 09:02.704
You just need to breathe.
Slow, slow.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.004
Good, good. You're getting better.

09:06.078 --> 09:08.706
Slow, slow. I think you're OK.

09:09.782 --> 09:11.841
There's no blood in the brain.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.853
ZMC fracture of the temporal bone,
ruptured eardrum.

09:14.921 --> 09:18.652
- Book us an OR.
- Not so fast, Dr. Grey.

09:18.724 --> 09:22.490
Mr. Gates, the patient has a name,
injured a facial nerve. Which means?

09:22.528 --> 09:25.122
That Mr. Gates will also
need a nerve repair.

09:25.164 --> 09:28.361
Does that take place before or after
Dr. Sloan's ossicular reconstruction?

09:35.207 --> 09:36.504
- Before.
- Incorrect.

09:36.542 --> 09:41.241
You have to explore for bone fragments,
reversing his hearing loss.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.373
Which is why I need you
to book that OR.

09:43.449 --> 09:46.612
If he has facial paralysis, it won't
matter if he can hear out of one ear.

09:46.652 --> 09:50.486
- Am I right, Dr. Grey?
- Uh...

09:50.523 --> 09:52.787
- Dr. Grey.
- Lexie?

09:53.926 --> 09:55.416
- Dr. Grey.
- Lexie.

09:55.461 --> 09:58.487
I think you both are amazing doctors.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.899
The car hit you while
you were in the crosswalk?

10:08.941 --> 10:12.536
Yeah. Are you almost done?
'Cause I need to go.

10:12.578 --> 10:14.011
Uh, no, um...

10:15.448 --> 10:18.212
Because we need to wait for the police.
They need a statement.

10:18.250 --> 10:22.687
Is that necessary? Can't I
just leave my name and number?

10:22.722 --> 10:25.657
I just need you to wait here
for one minute. OK?

10:25.691 --> 10:27.852
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

10:27.893 --> 10:31.556
Alex. I need to order a psych consult
for Mr. Meloy.

10:31.597 --> 10:34.464
He said he was walking,
but the pattern of his injuries

10:34.500 --> 10:37.298
aren't consistent.
Plus, he's acting agitated.

10:37.336 --> 10:41.329
Maybe because he was hit by a car.
Or 'cause he has you as a doctor.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.207
You need to discharge him.
We've a lot of other patients

10:44.243 --> 10:46.108
- with worse injuries.
- If he leaves

10:46.145 --> 10:48.340
and he hurts himself, it's on you.

10:52.718 --> 10:55.846
Fine. Get your consult.
But if someone in that waiting room dies

10:55.888 --> 10:58.322
because we don't have a bed,
that's on you.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.062
I hear
congratulations are in order.

11:05.097 --> 11:07.429
- What?
- The engagement.

11:07.466 --> 11:11.869
Our very own Seattle Grace wedding. I
couldn't be happier for the both of you.

11:11.971 --> 11:14.337
Thank you, sir.
Did you have an assignment?

11:14.373 --> 11:16.898
- Dresses.
- I'm sorry?

11:16.942 --> 11:20.844
Stevens has transformed her room
into a bridal boutique. So go.

11:20.913 --> 11:23.575
Try on dresses. That's an order.

11:26.552 --> 11:28.816
- I didn't think you wanted a dress.
- I don't.

11:28.854 --> 11:32.119
- How does he even know we're engaged?
- Richard's my friend.

11:32.158 --> 11:35.924
He didn't order the dress.
If you don't want to wear a dress,

11:35.961 --> 11:38.862
- talk to Izzie.
- Yeah. As the chemo drips

11:38.898 --> 11:42.698
into her cancer-y arm and she looks
at me with those cancer-y eyes,

11:42.735 --> 11:45.465
- those cancer-y, wedding-loving eyes?
- Be strong.

11:45.538 --> 11:49.770
We'll have bridesmaids in pink taffeta.
You'll wear top hat and morning coat

11:49.809 --> 11:52.334
and somebody will sing
<i>Wind-Beneath-My-Freaking-Wings.</i>

11:52.378 --> 11:56.371
- You want me to talk to her?
- OK, I'm glad we talked.

12:04.757 --> 12:07.419
Apparently, a morning coat
is non-negotiable.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.690
Also, we have to make time
for ballroom dancing lessons.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.263
Just so you know,
I wasn't looking for a relationship.

12:18.771 --> 12:22.605
Not with anyone, a he or a she.
But...

12:22.641 --> 12:24.768
...it just happened.

12:24.810 --> 12:28.041
And, uh...

12:28.080 --> 12:29.479
It feels good with her.

12:29.515 --> 12:31.745
It feels easy and, uh...

12:31.817 --> 12:33.216
...comfortable.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.449
I'm saying I'm happy.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.787
When have you ever
heard me willingly admit that?

12:39.859 --> 12:42.692
When you lived at home
with your mother and me.

12:42.728 --> 12:47.256
- You were happy then.
- I was 12. It didn't take much.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.392
Fly home with me.
I'll talk to the chief,

12:49.435 --> 12:51.562
- explain the circumstances.
- What?!

12:51.637 --> 12:56.074
- Dad, no. I'm not moving back home!
- Don't worry. Everything's gonna be OK.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.474
Everything is... O... OK.

13:04.016 --> 13:08.749
Tay-Sachs is always fatal in children,
usually by the age of four or five.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.288
She's six.

13:14.827 --> 13:17.796
I spoke to my friend who's
fundraising for Jessica.

13:17.863 --> 13:20.889
This place in Mexico.
They do experimental stem cell therapy.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.798
A couple of weeks,
we'll have enough money...

13:22.835 --> 13:26.362
Matt, Jessica doesn't
have a couple of weeks.

13:27.173 --> 13:30.609
It's quite possible
she only has a couple of hours.

13:30.676 --> 13:33.543
We talked about this.
We've talked about this a lot.

13:33.612 --> 13:36.445
And now it's here.
And I know it's hard.

13:36.515 --> 13:40.645
I know it's impossible.
But we've done everything we can.

13:40.686 --> 13:45.714
- You have done everything you...
- No. No!

13:45.791 --> 13:48.817
Listen. All we need
is a little more time.

13:48.861 --> 13:51.227
If you read
about these treatments...

13:56.101 --> 13:59.332
I don't mean to insult you.
I know you've done everything.

13:59.405 --> 14:04.342
I just need a few more days, more time.
She's a fighter. You know she'll fight.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.901
- I just need to get her there.
- Matt.

14:06.979 --> 14:09.539
She's not gonna make it to Mexico.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.749
And I am so sorry,

14:15.788 --> 14:21.021
but the best thing you can do
for her now is to be here.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.084
No!

14:25.030 --> 14:27.225
Don't tell me what's best.

14:27.266 --> 14:30.758
You don't tell me.
I will find a way.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.838
I will get her to Mexico tonight.

14:33.739 --> 14:38.005
Shame on you for giving up on her.
Shame on you, Dr. Robbins.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.530
Get a crash cart
to Izzie Steven's room! Izzie!

15:07.673 --> 15:08.697
What?

15:10.876 --> 15:16.041
I'm sorry! You should see your face!
It's your totally-freaking-out face!

15:18.217 --> 15:21.084
- You're joking? This is a joke?
- I'm sorry.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.486
I really did need you, though.

15:23.522 --> 15:27.083
I have all these dresses. I keep
paging Meredith to come try them on,

15:27.126 --> 15:30.618
and she won't answer.
So will you tell her to come in here?

15:30.663 --> 15:32.096
She'll listen to you.

15:35.467 --> 15:39.233
You have damage to your facial nerve
from a broken bone behind your ear.

15:39.271 --> 15:42.900
- Which I'll repair.
- Also, bleeding around your spleen.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.274
- We'll keep an eye on it.
- Your eardrum ruptured.

15:45.311 --> 15:47.711
You might lose the hearing
in your left ear.

15:47.746 --> 15:50.476
Unbelievable. Unbelievable!

15:50.516 --> 15:54.384
- That son of a bitch!
- Mr. Gates, try and stay calm.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.320
No. Don't tell me to stay calm.

15:56.355 --> 16:00.291
That son of bitch
dove in front of my car. He dove!

16:00.326 --> 16:04.695
Like he was Superman. Had his arms
stretched out and everything!

16:04.730 --> 16:06.755
I was going to the bank.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.496
I was just...

16:10.636 --> 16:12.126
...going to the bank.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.806
If I show you the dress, you
can never tell anyone because it's bad.

16:18.844 --> 16:23.042
- Really, really bad.
- OK, fine. It'll be our little secret.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.625
Oh, wow.

16:34.526 --> 16:39.259
- Photos are not secret!
- Isn't there a tiara that goes with it?

16:39.331 --> 16:43.893
- Put it on so I get the full effect.
- No tiara. I told you simple.

16:43.969 --> 16:46.529
- Buffalo wings at the reception.
- You can't.

16:46.572 --> 16:51.635
- Caterers don't do buffalo wings.
- Iz, this is a small wedding. Small.

16:51.710 --> 16:55.168
This is a big dress for a big wedding.

16:55.214 --> 16:58.081
Don't you have a dress
that doesn't make noise when it moves

16:58.117 --> 17:00.847
- or stand up by itself?
- You're getting married.

17:00.953 --> 17:05.013
It's a miracle. Meredith Grey,
child of darkness, found someone.

17:05.057 --> 17:08.685
Don't want to celebrate that?
It's your day, Meredith.

17:08.727 --> 17:11.252
You can't just piss it away
on a slip dress

17:11.296 --> 17:16.256
and a cheese tray from the grocery
store. That will make me so sad.

17:16.300 --> 17:20.601
I don't want to be sad. I'm suffering
through cancer. That's sad enough.

17:22.007 --> 17:25.101
Fine, give me the tiara.

17:29.915 --> 17:32.509
Oh! You're like a princess.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.042
Smile.

17:35.087 --> 17:36.782
I mean, home!
He's dragging me home!

17:41.293 --> 17:42.726
...who I want to spend it with!

17:42.761 --> 17:45.457
Got it. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

17:47.299 --> 17:49.290
I can see you're very upset.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.633
You page me, Robbins?

17:53.205 --> 17:55.605
You're her best friend
and I am at a giant loss,

17:55.641 --> 17:58.701
- not to mention the sick children...
- Go. I got this.

18:02.448 --> 18:04.075
Hey!

18:04.116 --> 18:07.449
Stop speaking Spanish because
I have to go to surgery in a minute

18:07.486 --> 18:11.513
- and I don't speak Spanish.
- My dad is taking me home.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.048
Talking to the chief and making me
quit my job and relationship,

18:15.094 --> 18:18.427
- he has yet to acknowledge exists.
- Are you 12? Tell him he's crazy.

18:18.464 --> 18:23.197
You don't understand. There isn't
anything he hasn't done for me. Nothing.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.669
He paid for my college, med school.
I have a huge trust fund.

18:26.705 --> 18:29.674
He doesn't want me to worry
about anything but being a doctor.

18:29.708 --> 18:33.804
The man's done nothing
but support me his whole life.

18:36.048 --> 18:39.950
Supporting someone and respecting
someone aren't the same thing.

18:39.985 --> 18:41.885
You need to tell him that.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.154
Well, look who's up.

18:52.197 --> 18:55.132
- Where's my dad?
- He should be here soon.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.067
How you feeling?

18:58.036 --> 18:59.663
You want some water?

19:01.039 --> 19:04.236
- I want my dad.
- It's OK.

19:05.377 --> 19:07.242
It's OK.

19:11.016 --> 19:12.483
Um...

19:12.518 --> 19:16.579
When my little boy is scared,
know what makes him feel better?

19:20.325 --> 19:23.886
When he rocks in the chair with me.
Let me show you.

19:23.929 --> 19:26.329
Here we go. All righty.

19:29.801 --> 19:32.065
There we go, sweetie.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.375
Yeah. He likes this.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.306
He likes this a lot.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.746
There you go.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.500
I got you the cheeseburger you wanted.
You sure about this?

20:06.538 --> 20:10.531
- You're OK? Not feeling nauseous?
- No, I'm good, I'm fine. See?

20:11.610 --> 20:12.702
Hi.

20:14.146 --> 20:17.138
- French fries. I love French fries.
- Meredith, let's go.

20:17.182 --> 20:20.583
I feel like this dress is giving me
a mammogram. It's squishing my boobs.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.610
- Let me see it.
- I'm taking it off.

20:25.757 --> 20:27.850
- Izzie, you OK?
- I think she's choking.

20:27.893 --> 20:32.421
Let's hit her with oxygen. Izzie.
Speak to me. Say something. Izzie?

20:32.464 --> 20:34.625
I'm not choking!

20:36.902 --> 20:38.130
I'm joking.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.532
OK, you gotta stop doing that.
It's not funny.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.803
Got Meredith out so I could see her
in her the dress. And it's gorgeous.

20:43.842 --> 20:45.673
- Tell her she has to stop.
- Izzie!

20:45.711 --> 20:48.202
- Very romantic. It's pretty, right?
- Pretty.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.614
And I see you've invited more people
to witness my humiliation?

20:51.650 --> 20:55.586
No. Derek and Mark aren't speaking.
We're heading into a six-hour surgery.

20:55.621 --> 21:00.024
Unless I slip this burger into
a sterile area, I'm not gonna make it.

21:00.058 --> 21:04.017
- Can you please come talk to them?
- Fine. OK. You can go.

21:04.062 --> 21:06.656
Cristina, will you help her
take the dress off?

21:07.799 --> 21:09.391
I'll be in the scrub room.

21:10.836 --> 21:13.896
Lexie just ate all my fries.
Can you please get me some more?

21:13.939 --> 21:16.840
Nice. The IL-2
isn't affecting you at all.

21:58.517 --> 22:00.178
OK.

22:10.362 --> 22:13.593
Doctor said if we can find a way to get
her there, he'll treat Jessica.

22:13.632 --> 22:15.463
Matt, she's been asking for you.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.298
Hey, baby. Guess what?

22:25.344 --> 22:28.541
We're gonna go to Mexico and
you're gonna love it there.

22:28.580 --> 22:32.380
The sky is so blue
and the sand is white.

22:32.417 --> 22:35.409
- And the water...
- Can we go tomorrow, Daddy?

22:35.454 --> 22:37.513
I'm so tired.

22:41.326 --> 22:45.092
Why don't you trade places with me.
It's you she wants.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.997
All I need is plane fare.
Then we'll be on our way.

23:00.145 --> 23:02.272
I can get someone
to relieve you for a while.

23:02.647 --> 23:05.115
If you still want
to watch me do that fundoplication.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.052
I'm OK.

23:22.634 --> 23:26.070
OK. Before you guys go in there
and start cutting on this patient,

23:26.104 --> 23:29.403
you need to apologize to each other.
If not for the patient, for me.

23:29.441 --> 23:32.103
Or for Lexie. Look at her.

23:32.511 --> 23:35.708
Her face is breaking out.
Her ass is humongous.

23:35.747 --> 23:39.046
It's true. I had to get the scrubs
with the elastic waistband.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.382
If you don't apologize,
she's not scrubbing in.

23:41.453 --> 23:44.718
I won't. You can't make me.
This should be a joyful time.

23:44.756 --> 23:48.988
- You should be the best man.
- The chief will be my best man.

23:49.027 --> 23:50.426
What?

23:52.364 --> 23:56.596
- Is my ass really...?
- Lexie, will you excuse us? Please.

23:58.136 --> 24:00.764
- The chief?
- The best man is my choice.

24:00.806 --> 24:03.138
When are you gonna
let go of the grudge you have?

24:03.175 --> 24:06.576
Derek, the man had
an affair with my mother,

24:06.611 --> 24:10.741
broke up my parents' marriage
and basically destroyed my childhood.

24:10.816 --> 24:13.683
Meanwhile, you've been best friends
with Mark for 20 years,

24:13.718 --> 24:16.312
and you're willing to throw
all that away over nothing.

24:16.354 --> 24:21.018
So don't talk to me about grudges. I'll
get over mine when you get over yours.

24:30.969 --> 24:34.405
- What are you doing up here?
- I stopped by to see Dr. Stevens.

24:34.439 --> 24:37.169
- I'm on my way back.
- What happened with the pedestrian?

24:37.209 --> 24:40.178
- Did the cops talk to him?
- I don't know. I don't think so.

24:40.212 --> 24:43.375
You don't know?
That guy may have tried to kill himself.

24:43.415 --> 24:46.976
- I called for a psych consult.
- A potentially suicidal patient

24:47.018 --> 24:51.352
and you're wandering around up here?
The guy who hit him is headed to an OR.

24:51.389 --> 24:54.153
He's in terrible shape.
He may not live!

24:54.192 --> 24:55.625
- I...
- Quiet!

24:56.561 --> 24:59.052
If that guy threw himself
in front of that car,

24:59.097 --> 25:03.261
he should pay. He should pay.
He better not walk out of that ER!

25:06.671 --> 25:08.070
Move faster, Karev!

25:11.276 --> 25:14.541
- You asked for a psych consult?
- Yes, I did.

25:14.613 --> 25:15.910
Where is he?

25:19.985 --> 25:22.920
- Oh, crap.
- Wonderful. You've lost him.

25:22.954 --> 25:25.684
I have not...
Have you checked the waiting room?

25:26.491 --> 25:28.823
O'Malley! Where's Mr. Meloy?

25:30.428 --> 25:33.829
Pysch was supposed to be examining him
and he's not my only patient.

25:37.168 --> 25:39.932
Nice. Nice! You lost him.

25:39.971 --> 25:44.032
- Hunt is gonna love hearing about this.
- You didn't want the pysch consult!

25:44.075 --> 25:47.374
I don't get it. I don't... I tried to
give you the benefit of the doubt...

25:47.412 --> 25:50.745
I don't get what Hunt sees in you
and I don't understand what Izzie sees.

25:50.782 --> 25:54.548
Shut up! I'm the one who's tried.
Izzie likes you. So I've tried.

25:54.586 --> 25:57.111
I've tried to find one little ounce
of respect for you,

25:57.155 --> 26:00.556
but you lost him. You thought
he was suicidal and turned your back.

26:00.592 --> 26:03.720
That's not on me. I'm done with you.
I'm done trying to respect you.

26:03.762 --> 26:06.196
I'm done!

26:32.657 --> 26:34.625
- What happened?
- We did ATLS protocol,

26:34.659 --> 26:37.924
- but he's...
- We inserted bilateral chest tubes,

26:37.963 --> 26:40.193
but he kept bleeding.
Then he started bradying

26:40.231 --> 26:42.893
so we pushed atropine.
I opened his chest when we lost vitals.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.459
Found edge of rib protruding
into his ascending aorta.

26:45.503 --> 26:47.994
I attached a clamp and
I'm getting heart activity.

26:48.039 --> 26:49.529
- You got an OR lined up?
- OR Two.

26:49.574 --> 26:52.270
- Good work, O'Malley. Scrub in.
- His aorta was looking...

26:52.310 --> 26:53.743
We got it, Karev.

26:57.649 --> 27:00.083
Do a middle fossa
craniotomy approach.

27:00.118 --> 27:03.519
- Let's get diamond burrs in.
- Don't bother. I ordered them.

27:03.588 --> 27:07.388
I may be irresponsible and untrustworthy
out there. I'm not in here.

27:07.425 --> 27:11.156
- I never said untrustworthy.
- You put the Berlin Wall around Lexie.

27:11.196 --> 27:14.461
Meredith asked me. People
do when someone they care about

27:14.499 --> 27:16.490
asks them to do something.
They do it.

27:16.534 --> 27:20.265
You should have, when I asked you
to stay away from Lexie. Or Addison.

27:20.305 --> 27:23.297
Oh, here we go. Addison.
The only note he can ever play.

27:23.341 --> 27:27.801
You know, I was gonna apologize
for decking you, 'cause I felt bad,

27:27.846 --> 27:31.111
but now, I'm gonna play it over
and over in my head and really enjoy it.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.446
Oh, hell!

27:32.484 --> 27:36.853
- It's coming from the pterygoid plexus.
- Get me 4-0 vicryl!

27:36.888 --> 27:40.051
- A clamp.
- You know what? I'm done.

27:40.725 --> 27:44.456
I give up. If I hadn't fallen for Little
Grey, you would have found a reason

27:44.496 --> 27:49.229
not to respect me. Always have. To you,
I'm always gonna be the charity case

27:49.267 --> 27:51.030
the Shepherds had to take in.

27:52.103 --> 27:54.765
- I got the bleeder.
- You threw the stitch already?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.908
Yeah.

27:59.310 --> 28:01.005
Hmm.

28:02.113 --> 28:04.104
Do you know where Dr. Grey is?

28:04.149 --> 28:07.084
- No, do you want me to page her?
- No, it's OK.

28:07.118 --> 28:08.551
OK.

28:12.624 --> 28:13.989
Thank you.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.693
Can you hold the retractor, please?

28:53.732 --> 28:56.667
He'll need 3-0 Prolene and
a Gore-Tex graft. I'll get it ready.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.127
You're good at this.

28:59.471 --> 29:02.963
You're thinking ten steps ahead of what
you're doing. Not many can do that.

29:03.007 --> 29:05.339
And the hairier things get,
the calmer you get.

29:05.376 --> 29:08.402
It's something you're wired with.
Chosen your specialty yet?

29:08.446 --> 29:10.539
- No, sir.
- It's trauma.

29:13.918 --> 29:17.046
I'm sorry. You want
to take Dr. Torres home?

29:17.088 --> 29:21.184
Now, I recognize that my daughter
is a senior resident

29:21.226 --> 29:26.459
and you've invested in her education.
I'm happy to write out a check

29:26.498 --> 29:30.832
for whatever amount
as a donation to your hospital.

29:30.869 --> 29:35.306
In exchange, I would ask you
to transfer her to St. Mary's in Miami.

29:35.340 --> 29:40.004
Um, I appreciate the offer, sir.
But, with all due respect,

29:40.044 --> 29:42.376
your daughter is a grown woman.

29:45.183 --> 29:47.117
Does she know you're here?

29:51.022 --> 29:53.081
You don't have children, do you?

29:53.124 --> 29:56.890
- No, no, no. I don't.
- No. You don't.

29:56.928 --> 29:58.589
Because if you did...

30:00.198 --> 30:03.497
"Your daughter's a grown woman..."
That means nothing.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.526
I mean, she's my child.

30:05.570 --> 30:09.233
It's like the blood running through
your veins. You don't outgrow it.

30:09.274 --> 30:12.437
Never goes away. The love.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.674
The need to protect them
from everything. From everything.

30:15.713 --> 30:17.476
Even from themselves.

30:20.084 --> 30:21.813
They grow up. They move out.

30:21.853 --> 30:25.914
They change. Become people
you don't even recognize.

30:25.957 --> 30:29.188
Make decisions...

30:31.296 --> 30:35.096
And they think you don't love them
because you don't understand.

30:35.700 --> 30:38.430
But it's the opposite.
See, it's the opposite.

30:39.971 --> 30:43.463
You fight for them. Always.
You never surrender.

30:43.508 --> 30:46.341
When your child is on the line,
you never surrender.

30:48.046 --> 30:51.641
I called eight organizations. And they
have a wait list for emergency funds.

30:51.683 --> 30:55.141
- I don't know what to do.
- Mr. Smithson,

30:55.186 --> 30:57.416
it's time to stop now.

30:58.857 --> 31:02.759
Maybe if we just go to the airport,
they'll let us on a flight. I mean...

31:02.794 --> 31:06.252
- People do things like that...
- Mr. Smithson.

31:06.297 --> 31:09.596
No! Please don't make me stop.

31:09.634 --> 31:12.398
Please don't make me stop.
Please don't make me stop!

31:12.437 --> 31:18.034
I wouldn't want to stop either.
But Jessica is terminal, Matt.

31:18.076 --> 31:21.170
In a few minutes,
her heart is going to stop.

31:21.679 --> 31:24.204
Now, I can pump her chest,

31:24.249 --> 31:26.809
I can push all sorts of medicines,

31:26.851 --> 31:30.287
and put her on a ventilator 'cause
she'll no longer be able to breathe.

31:30.321 --> 31:34.485
But even with all of that,
she's going to die.

31:39.264 --> 31:43.894
And the last person
who will have her hands on her,

31:43.935 --> 31:47.234
who will have been able to touch her,

31:47.272 --> 31:49.604
it's gonna be me or a nurse.

31:50.108 --> 31:52.099
Or it could be you.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.569
You don't want to miss this.

31:55.613 --> 32:00.141
This next part,
she needs her daddy for this part.

32:07.458 --> 32:10.120
Daddy?

32:11.162 --> 32:14.154
Are we going to Mexico?

32:35.186 --> 32:36.619
Yes.

32:37.922 --> 32:40.015
We're going to Mexico.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.395
Where the sky is blue, blue.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.592
And the sand is white.

32:52.737 --> 32:56.298
The water is so clear,
you can see all the way to the bottom.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.976
We're going.

33:02.013 --> 33:03.605
Just you and me.

33:06.584 --> 33:08.575
No more doctors.

33:11.622 --> 33:13.385
No more medicine.

33:14.058 --> 33:15.787
No more hospitals.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.386
Just you and me.

33:28.072 --> 33:31.974
We're gonna go.
Just relax. We'll be there soon.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.620
We'll play on the beach all day.

33:45.056 --> 33:46.921
We'll make sand castles.

33:55.099 --> 33:56.657
We're going.

33:57.635 --> 33:59.728
We'll be there soon. You'll see.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.468
We're gonna have so much fun.

34:04.575 --> 34:06.270
Just you and me.

34:06.978 --> 34:08.138
Just you and me.

34:18.188 --> 34:21.317
98 over 72.
That's good. That's good.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.121
Don't.

34:23.828 --> 34:26.956
Don't try to make me out
better than I am, because I'm not.

34:28.032 --> 34:29.522
I'm sick.

34:30.001 --> 34:33.835
You had an incredibly
high dose of IL-2 today.

34:34.972 --> 34:39.272
- This is how you're supposed to feel.
- All I wanted to do today

34:39.310 --> 34:42.643
was flip through magazines,
call caterers

34:42.679 --> 34:45.342
and make Mer try on dresses
I knew she'd hate.

34:47.150 --> 34:50.449
I thought it would be fun or...

34:51.789 --> 34:53.279
...funny.

34:56.694 --> 35:01.563
I thought I could be the same person
I was when I woke up this morning.

35:03.267 --> 35:04.325
But I'm not.

35:05.903 --> 35:07.632
I'm just another patient

35:07.672 --> 35:11.005
trapped inside a sick, dying,

35:11.042 --> 35:12.737
cancer-ridden body.

35:38.469 --> 35:39.902
What happened?

35:44.876 --> 35:47.344
He, uh... gave me an ultimatum.

35:49.113 --> 35:52.844
He said if I don't come home,
he'll take away my trust fund.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.010
He'd cut me off.

35:56.387 --> 35:58.821
So I cut him off.

35:58.856 --> 36:01.120
If he can't accept me for who I am...

36:06.497 --> 36:07.862
I cut him off.

36:10.535 --> 36:12.503
Are you OK?

36:16.374 --> 36:18.001
No.

36:18.776 --> 36:21.404
I mean... yeah. I don't know.

36:39.830 --> 36:44.130
I jumped in front of her car,

36:44.168 --> 36:47.194
and she was just driving to the bank.

36:47.238 --> 36:50.571
- We're talking about Cristina?
- I jumped in front of her. I knew.

36:50.608 --> 36:55.443
I knew I wasn't together, I knew
I was no good for her, for anyone.

36:56.514 --> 36:58.209
And I wrecked her.

37:00.484 --> 37:03.885
And that is unforgivable.

37:03.921 --> 37:07.687
I don't forgive myself for that.
I can't forgive myself for that.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.852
And I'm feeling shameful about that.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.430
That's what I feel today. Shame.

37:19.303 --> 37:21.863
Good. That's a start.

37:21.906 --> 37:26.468
- How is that a start?
- You named it.

37:26.510 --> 37:28.705
The feeling.

37:30.147 --> 37:32.479
You have to know what it is

37:32.516 --> 37:35.644
before you can start to navigate
to somewhere better.

37:38.055 --> 37:42.389
He has a long recovery ahead of him.
He severely damaged his facial nerves,

37:42.426 --> 37:45.327
- shattered his inner ear, lost blood.
- Oh, my God.

37:45.363 --> 37:50.733
But he'll be fine. He'll be in some
pain for a while, but he'll be fine.

37:50.801 --> 37:53.235
Oh, my God. Thank you.
Thank you both so much.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.570
Thank Dr. Sloan. That bleeding,
not a lot of surgeons can handle.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.040
He saved your husband's life.

38:01.145 --> 38:04.546
- Would you like to see him now?
- Yes. Thank you.

38:05.983 --> 38:08.781
You know, that's the first
compliment you've ever given me.

38:08.819 --> 38:11.287
- It was a statement of fact.
- See, why do you do that?

38:11.322 --> 38:13.449
Why can't you just give
a person a compliment?

38:13.491 --> 38:16.119
If you have to ask, it's not a
compliment. Are you asking?

38:16.160 --> 38:18.219
- Yes.
- Then it's not a compliment.

38:23.301 --> 38:26.862
Is there anything else you need
before I go?

38:28.105 --> 38:29.333
No.

38:31.242 --> 38:33.938
- You want to sit a while?
- No, I do not want to sit.

38:33.978 --> 38:37.436
I been sitting and lying down all day.

38:38.249 --> 38:41.013
- Dr. Bailey...
- Holding a child.

38:41.052 --> 38:44.783
If I wanted
to spend the day holding a child,

38:44.822 --> 38:48.383
I would have stayed home
to hold my own child.

38:48.426 --> 38:52.362
I didn't do a single
medical thing today.

38:52.396 --> 38:55.661
I didn't even put a Band-Aid
on a patient. I'm just tired.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.066
I... I'm done.

38:58.936 --> 39:00.767
Are you gonna tell your husband?

39:06.243 --> 39:08.837
What would I tell him?

39:08.879 --> 39:11.507
That it's more than just cutting.

39:11.549 --> 39:14.643
Peds is more than just cutting.

39:15.786 --> 39:18.914
And what you did today was heroic.

39:21.959 --> 39:24.450
And you know it.

39:28.065 --> 39:29.293
OK.

39:31.402 --> 39:33.393
Maybe I'll tell him that.

39:34.939 --> 39:36.998
<i>To do ourjobs...</i>

39:38.809 --> 39:42.142
<i>...we have to believe</i>
<i>defeat is not an option.</i>

39:46.384 --> 39:48.716
<i>That no matter</i>
<i>how sick our patients get...</i>

40:00.398 --> 40:02.229
You're gonna make a beautiful bride.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.631
<i>...there's hope for them.</i>

40:32.196 --> 40:33.254
Thanks.

40:41.806 --> 40:44.798
You kicked ass today, O'Malley.
You kicked my ass.

40:44.842 --> 40:49.939
- I just did what I had to do.
- No. You kicked ass.

40:50.648 --> 40:52.275
I'm not like that.

40:53.284 --> 40:57.584
I'm good, but I'm not like you.
I'm not good under pressure.

41:03.594 --> 41:06.154
She's really sick.

41:08.232 --> 41:10.928
Really sick.
And I'm not good under pressure.

41:11.669 --> 41:14.331
<i>But even when our hopes</i>
<i>give way to reality...</i>

41:15.372 --> 41:18.307
<i>...and we finally have to surrender</i>
<i>to the truth...</i>

41:20.177 --> 41:22.372
<i>...it just means</i>
<i>we've lost today's battle...</i>

41:22.413 --> 41:24.074
Could I have another, please?

41:25.082 --> 41:26.879
<i>...not tomorrow's war.</i>

41:30.521 --> 41:33.183
So I guess a big wedding
won't be that bad.

41:33.224 --> 41:36.489
I'm just sad 'cause I didn't get
a chance to see you in the actual dress.

41:37.461 --> 41:39.292
- You will.
- How?

41:39.330 --> 41:43.289
- If Derek and Mark don't make up...
- You're my sister, Lexie.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.199
You're in the wedding.

41:46.337 --> 41:50.239
Oh, my God!
I'm gonna be a bridesmaid?

41:50.274 --> 41:52.333
Oh, my God!
I don't know what to say.

41:52.376 --> 41:56.278
Wait and see what Izzie's picked out for
you to wear. You'll have plenty to say.

41:56.714 --> 41:58.648
<i>Here's the thing about surrender.</i>

41:58.682 --> 42:01.242
- You want one?
- So much.

42:01.285 --> 42:03.981
- <i>Once you do it...</i>
- We can still catch half of the game.

42:04.021 --> 42:06.888
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
- <i>...actually give in...</i>

42:07.691 --> 42:12.025
<i>...you forget why you were even fighting</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

42:12.062 --> 42:15.156
- You can stop eating now.
- Oh, thank God.
