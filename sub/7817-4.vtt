HAVEN'T BEEN DOING

{\an1}WELL...

01:06.983 --> 01:09.819
{\an1}NO WONDER YOU'VE
BEEN DOING POORLY.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.863
THIS NOTEBOOK IS TERRIBLE!

01:11.946 --> 01:14.824
{\an1}THIS IS HOW A

01:14.908 --> 01:18.578
BEHOLD,
THE GOLDEN NOTEBOOK.

01:18.661 --> 01:19.954
{\an1}WHY'S IT CALLED THE
GOLDEN NOTEBOOK?

01:20.038 --> 01:21.664
{\an5}IS IT MAGIC?
IS IT WRITTEN
IN GOLDEN?

01:21.748 --> 01:23.082
{\an1}NO AND NO.
IT WAS WRITTEN

01:23.166 --> 01:25.502

01:25.585 --> 01:27.170
IT'S PERFECT

GONNA STEAL IT.

I'M NOT GONNA STEAL IT.
I'M GOING TO BORROW IT.

UNDERLINE IT

{\an8}I CAN DO THIS.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.570
{\an8}I'M GOOD AT MATH.

21:20.654 --> 21:21.697
{\an7}BE SURE TO ASK QUESTIONS
AS SOON AS YOU DON'T

21:21.780 --> 21:23.532
{\an8}UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.450
{\an8}MR. DREN, COULD
YOU REPEAT THAT?

21:25.534 --> 21:28.537
{\an8}I'M HAVING A LITTLE
PROBLEM FOLLOWING.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.205
{\an1}SOME KIDS FEEL DUMB
ASKING QUESTIONS,

21:30.288 --> 21:31.623
{\an1}BUT WHAT'S REALLY DUMB
IS NOT ASKING QUESTIONS.

21:31.707 --> 21:36.128
{\an4}Dren: ...TO THE POWER OF 8,
THEN YOU JUST SUBTRACT
"X" FROM BOTH.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.963
I UNDERSTOOD
WHAT YOU SAID.

21:38.046 --> 21:41.008
AND THE ANSWER
IS 2.

21:41.091 --> 21:43.176
AND I DO NOT FEEL
THE NEED TO SCRATCH.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.555
{\an1}A LITTLE MATH ANXIETY
IS IN ALL OF US,

21:46.638 --> 21:47.889
SO START A STUDY GROUP.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.391
{\an1}WHEN YOU'RE WORKING
WITH OTHERS,

21:49.474 --> 21:51.768
{\an1}IT CAN GET YOU SOME ANSWERS
AND MAYBE EVEN SOME NEW FRIENDS.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.061
{\an8}AND WHEN YOU JOIN A GROUP,

21:53.145 --> 21:55.063
{\an8}BE SURE TO SHARE
THE WORK EVENLY.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.524
I OWE YOU GUYS AN APOLOGY.

21:57.607 --> 21:58.734
{\an1}I STUCK YOU
WITH ALL THE WORK.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.235
{\an1}BUT IF YOU GIVE ME
ANOTHER SHOT,

22:00.318 --> 22:02.404
I PROMISE TO WORK HARDER.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.330
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WITH
CONFIDENCE, SOME STUDY BUDDIES,

22:12.414 --> 22:16.376
{\an1}AND PERSISTENCE,
MATH REALLY CAN BE FUN.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.920
{\an1}PERHAPS MY WAY
IS OLD-FASHIONED.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.048
MAYBE NEW STUDENT HAS POINT.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.258
WE CAN LEARN AND ENJOY MATH.

22:23.341 --> 22:32.601
{\an1}SO TODAY WE HAVE
SUPER FUN MATH DANCE PARTY!

22:36.688 --> 22:39.066
YOU DID IT!
MATH IS FUN!

22:39.149 --> 22:44.237
BUT NOW XAVIER
IS EVEN SCARIER.

22:44.321 --> 22:48.158
NEW STUDENT,
DANCE WITH ME!

22:50.702 --> 22:54.790
{\an1}LET'S FACE IT, WITHOUT MATH,
THERE'S NO CARS, NO COMPUTERS,

22:54.873 --> 22:56.208
NO VIDEO GAMES.

22:56.291 --> 22:57.793
YOU'D BE AMAZED
AT HOW MUCH YOU NEED IT,

22:57.876 --> 23:00.337
{\an1}ESPECIALLY WHEN TRYING
TO CATCH A WEASEL.

23:00.420 --> 23:03.548
{\an1}GORDY, YOUR MATH
IS WAY OFF.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.467
[BABBLING]

23:13.934 --> 23:17.979
[GRUNTING]

23:24.736 --> 23:26.947
I TOLD YOU.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.949
WITHOUT MATH, WE ARE
CAVEMEN EATING MUD.

23:29.032 --> 23:32.828
