NETFLIX PRESENTS

01:31.750 --> 01:33.542
-Let me get it, Mom.
-I got it.

01:34.375 --> 01:35.208
Sit down.

01:36.458 --> 01:37.750
Come on, sit down.

01:37.833 --> 01:41.167
I told you not to work so hard.
You end up like this.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.750
I have to work.

01:43.542 --> 01:45.125
Hand me the gift bag.

01:48.792 --> 01:50.833
I got you a little something.

01:53.833 --> 01:54.667
Look.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.458
A new shirt for your trip.

01:59.958 --> 02:02.125
You don't need to waste money on this.

02:02.208 --> 02:03.125
Waste money?

02:03.208 --> 02:05.208
Will you travel wearing rags? No!

02:05.292 --> 02:08.583
-This is a month's worth of groceries.
-But you'll look gorgeous.

02:08.667 --> 02:10.208
Try it on.

02:10.292 --> 02:11.375
Isn't it gorgeous?

02:11.917 --> 02:13.542
-It is.
-It's really nice.

02:13.625 --> 02:14.667
It is.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.417
Look, there's more.

02:18.458 --> 02:19.333
<i>Dona </i>Ana…

02:20.583 --> 02:21.417
Right?

02:22.042 --> 02:23.750
You can read them on your trip.

02:24.333 --> 02:25.750
You picked them, didn't you?

02:26.417 --> 02:28.708
-I did.
-What's written here?

02:29.292 --> 02:32.875
Flying-- Don't do that!

02:33.583 --> 02:35.750
Give it here. Let me put it aside.

02:36.375 --> 02:37.417
Thank you, Mom.

02:38.208 --> 02:39.250
-Shall we eat?
-Yes.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.208
Say grace.

02:42.250 --> 02:45.250
Thank you, Lord,
for the food we eat today.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.125
May Mateus have a nice trip.

02:48.208 --> 02:50.958
Protect and guide him to the right path.

02:51.542 --> 02:53.417
-So be it.
-Amen.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.750
-Hey! Shoo that cat away!
-Out!

02:56.833 --> 02:58.667
Let it be! Come here.

02:59.333 --> 03:00.833
-It wants our food.
-It does.

03:00.917 --> 03:02.583
No, you first.

03:02.667 --> 03:05.125
-Sit.
-No, you've been doing chores.

03:05.208 --> 03:07.042
Oh, Lord. I'll eat, but…

03:07.125 --> 03:08.042
Eat more. Here.

03:08.875 --> 03:10.958
-That's enough.
-No, a bit more.

03:11.042 --> 03:12.125
I'm not hungry.

03:24.792 --> 03:26.792
They're running away from you.

03:50.458 --> 03:51.708
Hey there!

03:55.250 --> 03:56.667
-Hi, Mateus.
-Hi, Gilson.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.292
-Ready, man?
-I'm ready.

03:58.375 --> 03:59.458
Great!

03:59.542 --> 04:01.250
Meet my mom and sisters.

04:01.333 --> 04:02.875
<i>Dona </i>Ana, it's a pleasure.

04:02.958 --> 04:05.208
-Mateus speaks very highly of you.
-Hello.

04:05.292 --> 04:07.875
I'll stop by sometime for a cup of coffee.

04:07.958 --> 04:10.542
-Okay.
-You'll see how things will change.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.667
Thank God, my mom never had
to pick up a hoe again.

04:14.708 --> 04:16.958
In fact, this is for you, <i>Dona </i>Ana.

04:17.792 --> 04:19.875
Great changes are really coming.

04:19.958 --> 04:21.583
This is just the beginning.

04:22.375 --> 04:23.917
I insist, <i>Dona </i>Ana.

04:28.542 --> 04:30.375
Your boy will make you proud.

04:32.458 --> 04:34.917
-Let's go, Mateus. We're late.
-Let's go.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.750
São Paulo waits for no one!

04:37.292 --> 04:38.917
-What's up?
-Hi, Mateus.

05:41.125 --> 05:43.750
How's Julia?
She must be missing you already.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.792
She is already texting me.

05:46.875 --> 05:48.292
But I won't stay long.

05:48.375 --> 05:51.625
Just long enough to make money
to build us a home here.

05:51.708 --> 05:54.250
You're crazy.
You let a woman hold you back.

05:55.292 --> 05:57.625
If it's up to me, I'll never come back.

05:57.708 --> 06:01.292
Family is everything to me.
My money is theirs.

06:01.375 --> 06:05.042
What you can't do is miss the chance
of getting out of here.

06:05.125 --> 06:07.042
-To make money, get rich.
-Yes.

06:07.625 --> 06:10.250
I go to the barber shop every single week.

06:10.333 --> 06:12.208
-That's right.
-Get some nice cologne…

06:12.875 --> 06:16.292
I'm already ugly. If I don't
clean myself up, who's gonna want me?

06:17.583 --> 06:21.375
Hang in there, kids.
We'll be in São Paulo in just five hours.

06:46.208 --> 06:47.042
Samuel.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.500
Welcome to the big city, kids.

07:13.583 --> 07:16.458
-Wake up!
-I've never seen so many cars in my life.

07:16.542 --> 07:18.542
São Paulo is cool, isn't it?

07:18.625 --> 07:20.500
Look, man!

07:20.583 --> 07:22.667
As far as the eye can see!

07:49.250 --> 07:51.208
Hey there, Mr. Luca!

07:51.292 --> 07:53.042
How are you doing?

07:53.125 --> 07:54.583
I can't complain.

07:55.375 --> 07:58.625
I brought the boys.
They're looking forward to starting.

08:02.458 --> 08:03.625
How was the trip?

08:04.375 --> 08:05.500
This is Samuel.

08:06.458 --> 08:07.292
Ezequiel.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.708
-Isaque and Mateus.
-Nice to meet you.

08:11.833 --> 08:14.958
-Where are you all from?
-Catanduva.

08:16.375 --> 08:17.708
You worked the fields?

08:18.333 --> 08:21.000
-We do a bit of everything.
-They're no slackers.

08:21.083 --> 08:21.917
Nice.

08:22.542 --> 08:23.875
Is that all, Mr. Luca?

08:24.500 --> 08:26.167
Yes, Gilson. Thank you.

08:26.250 --> 08:28.542
-I gotta go. Be well, kids.
-Thanks.

08:28.625 --> 08:29.958
-Bye, Gilson.
-Come.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.625
That's the lunchroom.

08:35.125 --> 08:36.417
Workshop's here.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.208
All this is scrap.

08:45.083 --> 08:46.708
Leave your stuff on the beds.

08:49.917 --> 08:52.458
I need your documents. Did you bring IDs?

08:53.625 --> 08:54.792
May I ask why?

08:55.458 --> 08:56.583
For the paperwork.

08:57.875 --> 08:58.875
Here, Mr. Luca.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.167
-Thanks.
-Here, Mr. Luca.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.833
Mr. Luca, and our contracts?

09:04.833 --> 09:06.667
We'll look into it this week.

09:09.208 --> 09:13.417
With all due respect, we came here
for honest work with a proper contract.

09:15.708 --> 09:17.083
I'll speak with HR.

09:18.583 --> 09:21.625
Listen up, tomorrow we got
seven deliveries to take care of.

09:22.708 --> 09:23.917
We start at 5:00 a.m.

09:24.958 --> 09:26.125
How about dinner?

09:27.500 --> 09:30.292
Gilson said all meals would be provided.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.875
They make good food down the street.

09:36.417 --> 09:37.667
Here, twenty bucks.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.208
-We start early tomorrow.
-Yes, sir.

09:41.958 --> 09:42.792
First thing.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.292
Check out those buildings.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.875
I'll buy a condo here.

09:48.958 --> 09:50.917
That one is mine. I bought it.

09:52.167 --> 09:55.000
I wanna see the city from way up high.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.167
I like that one.

09:56.250 --> 09:57.500
-Yeah.
-That's nice too.

10:03.500 --> 10:06.292
So, is everybody ready to order?

10:06.375 --> 10:07.500
-Not yet.
-Thanks.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.917
Call me when you're ready, okay?

10:13.125 --> 10:13.958
I want a steak.

10:15.333 --> 10:16.458
It's this one.

10:17.292 --> 10:19.792
-No sides?
-It's written here.

10:22.583 --> 10:23.917
It's this one, see?

10:26.083 --> 10:29.167
Steak is okay.
Should we order two and share?

10:29.250 --> 10:31.750
I don't care. I want to eat, not read.

10:33.708 --> 10:35.583
Ma'am, two steak specials.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.917
Two steak specials for four.

10:39.792 --> 10:42.708
Did you see there's open enrollment
at our school?

10:43.333 --> 10:45.833
-Maybe when I get back.
-Did you graduate?

10:46.417 --> 10:49.958
-I finished 8th grade.
-Wow! Couldn't you find a better job?

10:50.583 --> 10:52.125
There was only the fields.

10:53.708 --> 10:54.792
We met there.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.250
-We worked hard.
-Did we?

10:58.083 --> 11:00.708
We'd take twice as long
'cause he never shut up.

11:00.792 --> 11:02.250
I didn't shut up?

11:02.333 --> 11:04.708
-Yeah.
-You're the one who never shut up.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.833
How is your
<i>The Princess and the Pea </i>mattress?

11:11.292 --> 11:14.625
-Better than the one at home.
-I've never slept in a bed.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.333
-Where did you sleep?
-In a hammock.

11:17.417 --> 11:20.083
-Geez, I hate hammocks.
-I'm not a fan either.

11:20.833 --> 11:21.875
Beds are better.

11:23.542 --> 11:25.708
-Were you at your parents'?
-My Grandma's.

11:25.792 --> 11:28.375
And Mr. Reginaldo's. I worked for him.

11:28.458 --> 11:30.542
-Where are you from?
-From far away.

11:31.167 --> 11:32.208
How old are you?

11:34.958 --> 11:36.375
Don't you know?

11:38.083 --> 11:40.583
You really are a hick, aren't you?

11:46.125 --> 11:47.500
What is the magazine about?

11:49.042 --> 11:51.875
-Aviation.
-It must be good to know how to read.

11:52.375 --> 11:54.083
Would you like to go to college?

11:54.583 --> 11:55.833
College…

11:57.167 --> 11:58.917
I won't die in this junkyard.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.208
-College is not for us.
-Bullshit.

12:04.125 --> 12:07.125
We just got 1,100 lbs of copper wire.

12:07.875 --> 12:08.958
You have to strip it.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.042
Look.

12:14.958 --> 12:16.042
You hold it tight…

12:21.292 --> 12:22.125
Watch.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.833
Remove the rubber cover.

12:25.625 --> 12:26.833
Pure copper.

12:27.833 --> 12:29.375
It's worth a lot of money.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.750
Copper goes here, rubber there.

12:35.292 --> 12:36.417
On to stainless steel.

12:37.250 --> 12:38.083
Hold it.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.208
Grab the magnet.

12:45.958 --> 12:48.000
If it doesn't stick, it's worth more.

12:49.167 --> 12:50.250
It goes there.

12:50.333 --> 12:51.375
Is it hard?

12:51.458 --> 12:52.708
-No, sir.
-Ready to work?

12:52.792 --> 12:55.500
-Let's do it!
-Split up and get to work.

12:57.042 --> 12:59.167
Hurry up. The first truck is coming.

13:10.750 --> 13:11.750
Unload the truck!

13:14.708 --> 13:15.542
Come on, son!

13:16.208 --> 13:17.292
No work, no money.

13:29.792 --> 13:30.625
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

13:30.708 --> 13:32.750
<i>Hi, Mateus. Did you arrive safely?</i>

13:32.833 --> 13:34.458
<i>I did, thank God.</i>

13:34.542 --> 13:36.042
<i>So? How do you like it?</i>

13:36.125 --> 13:39.250
It's a big junkyard, Mom.
There's a lot of work.

13:39.792 --> 13:41.458
<i>No, I meant the city.</i>

13:41.542 --> 13:43.292
We haven't gone out yet.

13:43.375 --> 13:45.208
We'll do something next week.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.583
<i>You must be tired, right, son?</i>
<i>I miss you and…</i>

13:49.625 --> 13:52.542
YOU'RE OUT OF CREDIT
REPLY "1" TO ADD MORE

14:00.542 --> 14:02.458
A pile of scrap for each of you.

14:27.958 --> 14:28.958
Break down the cars.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.875
We've worked the whole week without pay.

14:37.958 --> 14:41.125
-If he gets paid, he has to pay us.
-I'd rather be at home.

14:41.208 --> 14:42.583
I won't work for free.

14:42.667 --> 14:45.292
Don't worry.
If we do our job, he'll pay us.

15:07.750 --> 15:09.500
All right. Yes, sir.

15:11.458 --> 15:14.875
Listen, we have two more deliveries today.
Hurry up.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.375
Our lunch break is not over, Mr. Luca.

15:20.042 --> 15:20.875
Oh, yeah?

15:21.875 --> 15:23.250
Neither are the deliveries.

15:24.375 --> 15:25.917
We're late. What do we do?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.625
We did over 30 deliveries this week
without pay.

15:28.708 --> 15:30.750
Sorry, but I'll finish my lunch.

15:31.292 --> 15:32.917
With all due respect…

15:33.000 --> 15:36.792
When we accepted the job,
Gilson told us we'd get paid per delivery.

15:36.875 --> 15:38.792
We're working overtime without pay.

15:38.875 --> 15:39.833
Didn't you?

15:41.625 --> 15:42.458
How about me?

15:44.542 --> 15:48.917
Who paid your families in advance?
Who's paying for your lodgings?

15:49.750 --> 15:51.958
Food, transport, all your expenses?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Is that cheap?

15:58.042 --> 15:59.375
You will get paid.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.167
Pay what you owe me.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.250
I'll deduct it from the wages.

16:03.333 --> 16:04.375
Nobody told us that.

16:05.375 --> 16:06.792
That's not my problem.

16:06.875 --> 16:08.875
Fuck you and your debt then!

16:11.208 --> 16:12.042
Nando.

16:14.458 --> 16:15.542
That's enough, Nando.

16:19.458 --> 16:20.500
He got the message.

16:22.833 --> 16:24.875
You're lucky I write it all down.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.250
Work and pay it off.

16:35.750 --> 16:36.875
Give me your phone.

16:38.625 --> 16:39.917
Now, dammit!

16:40.000 --> 16:40.833
Give it to me.

16:53.208 --> 16:54.167
I don't have it.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.000
It's for collateral.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.750
$1,000 in advance for each of you.

17:28.833 --> 17:30.333
$5,000 for the recruiter.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.792
$3,000 per month for lodging.

17:32.875 --> 17:34.583
$2,000 for one-way trip.

17:35.125 --> 17:36.667
$700 per month for food.

17:37.292 --> 17:39.292
$200 per month for tools.

17:39.833 --> 17:42.125
And the $20 for food on the first day.

17:42.208 --> 17:44.125
That motherfucking thief!

17:46.458 --> 17:48.500
He spent it on us, we must pay him back.

17:48.583 --> 17:51.333
Is it fair to pay $3,000 a month
for this pigsty?

17:51.417 --> 17:53.333
It pays for a mansion back home.

17:54.292 --> 17:56.000
I always pay my debts.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.792
It's more than our wage.
We'll go to the police.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.375
I can't.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.458
Come on, Ezequiel.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.625
I can't go back empty-handed.

18:10.042 --> 18:11.458
You don't have to go back.

18:12.083 --> 18:13.417
You can stay at my place.

18:13.958 --> 18:15.417
Now, pack up your stuff.

18:42.083 --> 18:42.958
No way out.

18:44.542 --> 18:46.250
I'll check the gate upstairs.

19:12.333 --> 19:13.708
Looking for something?

19:14.458 --> 19:15.958
Where's the key, motherfucker?

19:19.500 --> 19:20.500
Going for a stroll?

19:24.792 --> 19:26.500
Let me make it very clear.

19:28.583 --> 19:29.875
You took a ride here.

19:31.208 --> 19:33.958
I did you a favor, and now you owe me.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.417
What do you do when you owe money?

19:38.750 --> 19:39.875
-Pay.
-You pay.

19:41.458 --> 19:44.833
Back to the fucking dorm.
You'll work tomorrow. Move!

20:03.333 --> 20:05.125
Son of a bitch!

20:11.208 --> 20:12.833
Why did Gilson set us up?

20:12.917 --> 20:15.167
-He didn't know.
-Yes, he did!

20:15.250 --> 20:17.250
He said he knew the guys, it was fine.

20:17.333 --> 20:19.833
-I'll kill that asshole.
-We must get out of here.

20:19.917 --> 20:22.708
We'll jump him
when he comes in tomorrow.

20:22.792 --> 20:25.333
He'll be ready.
Let's do it when the gate is open.

20:25.417 --> 20:27.583
-When a truck arrives.
-He has a gun.

20:27.667 --> 20:29.750
Can we distract him?

20:29.833 --> 20:32.125
It's a waste of time.
Let's jump him tomorrow.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.583
That guy knows what he's doing, Isaque.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.125
We must be smarter than him.

21:09.292 --> 21:10.125
Go.

21:11.542 --> 21:12.583
Cool.

21:15.083 --> 21:16.167
Mr. Luca!

21:17.708 --> 21:19.125
Samuel!

21:20.542 --> 21:21.833
Help him, Mr. Luca!

21:23.375 --> 21:25.375
Call an ambulance. He's dying.

21:26.208 --> 21:27.083
Samuel!

21:28.750 --> 21:30.375
Goddammit!

21:31.792 --> 21:32.708
Bring water.

21:42.875 --> 21:44.458
Stop!

21:44.542 --> 21:45.500
Stop, damn it!

21:45.583 --> 21:47.583
Step back!

21:49.167 --> 21:50.000
Are you crazy?

21:55.708 --> 21:57.042
One escaped, Mr. Luca.

22:47.167 --> 22:48.167
Back in Ariranha,

22:48.917 --> 22:51.500
near the edge of town,
there's a house that's on its own.

22:52.125 --> 22:53.167
It's <i>Dona </i>Ana's.

22:54.167 --> 22:55.792
She lives with her three children.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.625
Odete, Cirlene,

22:57.708 --> 22:58.750
and you, Mateus.

22:59.833 --> 23:00.875
What's up, Samuel?

23:02.500 --> 23:06.167
Your family lives in a stilt house,
near Mr. Geraldo's farm.

23:07.542 --> 23:10.375
You live at number 2,
right by the highway.

23:11.583 --> 23:13.875
Do you know what I hate
in the countryside?

23:14.375 --> 23:16.375
Everything turns into news.

23:17.375 --> 23:20.208
I don't want anyone's mother
to be in the news.

23:22.708 --> 23:24.917
You'd better not even look at Luca.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.250
It'll be worse for your families.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.125
<i>Toothpaste!</i>

23:40.625 --> 23:41.917
It was your idea, right?

23:42.750 --> 23:45.333
Against the wall! Go! Move, damn it!

23:46.417 --> 23:49.000
-Legs apart, damn it!
-You want to act like animals?

23:49.500 --> 23:53.125
We'll treat you like animals.
No shower. No toothpaste.

23:53.208 --> 23:54.208
No dinner.

23:56.833 --> 23:57.667
What?

23:58.417 --> 23:59.417
Wanna eat?

24:01.292 --> 24:02.500
Gotta earn it.

24:04.417 --> 24:05.333
No running away!

24:06.750 --> 24:08.958
Do your job, get the deliveries done.

24:11.125 --> 24:12.708
-How are we?
-We're late.

24:12.792 --> 24:15.333
-How late?
-Six deliveries behind, Mr. Luca.

24:18.292 --> 24:19.250
Get to work!

24:19.792 --> 24:20.917
Yes.

24:22.292 --> 24:24.167
Yes, Mr. Luca.

24:24.250 --> 24:25.792
Thank you, Mr. Luca.

24:25.875 --> 24:27.500
Please, Mr. Luca.

24:27.583 --> 24:29.333
Respect, damn it!

24:30.125 --> 24:31.917
-Yes, Mr. Luca.
-Yes, Mr. Luca.

24:34.833 --> 24:36.250
Have a good day at work.

24:37.792 --> 24:39.292
Move! Now!

24:41.667 --> 24:42.500
Hurry up!

24:44.042 --> 24:45.292
Go on! Get started!

24:46.375 --> 24:47.208
Hurry up!

24:50.042 --> 24:51.417
Stop!

24:53.042 --> 24:53.875
Help!

24:54.792 --> 24:55.625
Hey!

24:56.583 --> 24:57.417
Here!

24:58.625 --> 24:59.500
Try it.

25:00.042 --> 25:02.292
Ask for help. No one will hear you.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.333
But if they do,

25:04.417 --> 25:07.167
my friends will visit your families.

25:09.833 --> 25:11.875
Let's get back to work, shall we?

25:12.375 --> 25:13.292
Get going!

25:37.458 --> 25:39.958
-Shut up, idiot!
-Stop it, Isaque.

25:47.333 --> 25:48.958
That hick will fuck it all up.

25:49.458 --> 25:51.833
Stop whining or I will punch you, pansy.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.083
Let him be.

25:53.167 --> 25:56.000
You missed Luca's head
because of this idiot.

25:57.542 --> 26:00.250
If it weren't for him,
Luca would be fucked up by now.

26:07.208 --> 26:08.958
I'll get you, you son of a bitch.

26:42.792 --> 26:43.750
Idiot!

26:47.792 --> 26:49.042
What the fuck?

26:49.125 --> 26:52.458
-Are you defending that dick?
-You'll fuck it all up!

26:55.375 --> 26:56.458
Who did it?

27:10.708 --> 27:13.625
You're all doing overtime
to make up for this crap.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.333
Relax. I have to clean it.

27:55.667 --> 27:57.583
I didn't mean to do anything wrong.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.000
Do you miss your grandma?

28:04.708 --> 28:05.542
Yes.

28:08.542 --> 28:09.667
And Mr. Reginaldo?

28:12.000 --> 28:13.542
Only my grandma likes me.

28:17.875 --> 28:19.417
Do you think she'll come?

28:32.875 --> 28:37.875
<i>Sakafunã, Sakafunã</i>

28:39.167 --> 28:41.583
<i>And Omolu, how handsome, handsome</i>

28:42.250 --> 28:45.417
<i>My friend, Sakafunã</i>

28:46.250 --> 28:50.875
<i>Sakafunã, Sakafunã</i>

28:51.625 --> 28:54.625
<i>And Omolu, how handsome, handsome</i>

28:54.708 --> 28:57.750
<i>My friend, Sakafunã</i>

28:57.833 --> 29:00.125
Lord Omolu, for the living and the dead,

29:00.625 --> 29:03.292
don't allow any evil to befall his body.

29:03.792 --> 29:06.917
Cleanse his head,
eyes, throat, body, and soul.

29:07.417 --> 29:08.250
<i>Axé.</i>

29:09.750 --> 29:12.833
<i>Bless us, my father</i>

29:12.917 --> 29:15.667
<i>Atotô Obaluayê</i>

29:15.750 --> 29:18.583
<i>Bless us, my father</i>

29:18.667 --> 29:21.042
<i>Atotô Obaluayê</i>

29:21.625 --> 29:23.375
<i>Atotô Obaluayê…</i>

29:29.875 --> 29:30.875
What is this?

29:32.625 --> 29:35.000
-Give it to him.
-Mr. Luca, we need to shower.

30:09.792 --> 30:11.333
No rest for the weary!

30:11.958 --> 30:13.042
Hurry the fuck up!

30:13.125 --> 30:14.125
Hey!

30:14.208 --> 30:15.250
Throw it there!

30:53.875 --> 30:55.042
Shit!

30:56.083 --> 30:57.792
Are you hanging me out to dry?

30:58.292 --> 30:59.417
Yes. Good luck.

31:00.542 --> 31:03.083
Check this out. I'm faster than you.

31:06.792 --> 31:09.458
I can't imagine anyone hurting my family.

31:09.542 --> 31:13.458
If Julia finds out, Luca better get ready.
She'll fuck him up.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.500
Julia's a badass.

31:17.583 --> 31:20.000
She's the love of my life.
We'll have three kids.

31:20.083 --> 31:23.625
They better take after her.
Otherwise, they're screwed.

31:37.333 --> 31:38.292
For you.

31:42.167 --> 31:43.333
It was a good week.

31:44.333 --> 31:45.583
We need to shower.

31:54.125 --> 31:55.083
Go on.

31:57.708 --> 31:58.792
Changed your mind?

32:30.625 --> 32:32.625
I'll cut that bastard and escape.

32:32.708 --> 32:34.458
You know what happens then?

32:34.542 --> 32:36.667
He can't get to our family if he's dead.

32:36.750 --> 32:40.083
-He's not alone.
-Neither are we. It's four against one.

32:41.167 --> 32:42.250
Well?

32:44.542 --> 32:46.917
Bunch of assholes. I'll do it myself.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.500
-So, you'll kill him?
-Yes.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.167
And escape without our help?

32:52.792 --> 32:54.625
And then what? What's the plan?

32:55.875 --> 32:59.333
Do you think they won't go after
your family? Your mother, your sister?

32:59.417 --> 33:01.750
-Shut up about my sister!
-I have a plan!

33:01.833 --> 33:04.958
We make a deal with him so nothing
will happen to us or our families.

33:05.042 --> 33:06.625
I won't make a deal with him.

33:08.292 --> 33:10.208
Selling yourselves for a shower.

33:13.458 --> 33:14.833
You cowards.

33:25.792 --> 33:27.583
<i>I can increase productivity.</i>

33:28.083 --> 33:29.917
<i>We won't give you any more trouble.</i>

33:32.042 --> 33:33.833
I can make more money for you.

33:37.625 --> 33:38.458
Can you?

33:43.375 --> 33:45.042
I want eight deliveries a day.

33:46.625 --> 33:47.583
I can do more.

33:49.250 --> 33:51.250
We'll pay our debt in six months.

33:54.208 --> 33:55.458
Ten deliveries…

33:58.583 --> 33:59.667
six months…

34:06.958 --> 34:08.458
If your buddies screw up,

34:09.458 --> 34:10.875
your ass is on the line.

34:17.250 --> 34:18.333
Go tell them.

34:28.750 --> 34:31.000
Son of a bitch!
We'll be dead in six months.

34:32.625 --> 34:34.833
You won't ruin the deal I got us.

34:34.917 --> 34:37.458
Do your job, keep your head down.
Or I'll fuck you up.

34:37.542 --> 34:39.250
We have ten deliveries. Move!

34:40.083 --> 34:41.000
Fucking move!

34:42.875 --> 34:43.792
Go, Isaque.

34:48.042 --> 34:49.667
Let's split up to work faster.

34:50.167 --> 34:51.000
Come on.

34:51.792 --> 34:55.208
Come on, guys. Let's do it
and try to get out of here soon.

35:25.417 --> 35:26.292
Twenty-seven.

35:32.167 --> 35:33.042
It's all here.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.500
-Already?
-We're ahead of schedule.

35:42.208 --> 35:44.292
When you're done,
go take down the doors.

35:45.958 --> 35:46.792
Mateus.

35:51.875 --> 35:53.833
I'm looking at the damn contract.

35:55.042 --> 35:56.417
Yes, I'm looking at it.

35:57.125 --> 35:58.833
In theory, everything works.

36:02.125 --> 36:04.000
Fuck their inspection.

36:04.583 --> 36:06.500
$800k? It's not worth it.

36:07.083 --> 36:07.958
Okay. Bye.

36:11.458 --> 36:14.292
Go to Shirley's bar.
Get me a pack of cigarettes.

36:31.750 --> 36:35.292
If you miss home
and want to visit your mom,

36:37.375 --> 36:38.292
you can go.

36:40.458 --> 36:42.625
Just ask her to make us some coffee

36:43.625 --> 36:44.708
for when I arrive.

37:26.042 --> 37:26.958
<i>Ma'am.</i>

37:29.250 --> 37:30.083
Yes?

37:31.333 --> 37:32.417
Cigarettes, please.

37:34.917 --> 37:36.083
No, the red filter.

37:49.667 --> 37:50.667
Hang on a minute.

37:52.167 --> 37:53.000
Here.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.083
It's on the house.

37:58.583 --> 37:59.667
Tell Luca

37:59.750 --> 38:02.083
that if he needs anything, we're here.

38:02.708 --> 38:03.708
Okay?

38:05.125 --> 38:06.333
I'm fine, thank you.

38:24.375 --> 38:25.208
Mr. Luca?

38:26.167 --> 38:30.292
You should say here, "During said period,
the company will distribute,"

38:30.833 --> 38:33.833
instead of "will be distributing."

38:41.833 --> 38:42.667
Fix it, then.

38:44.125 --> 38:44.958
Go ahead.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.167
Reading my contract?

38:50.250 --> 38:52.000
-No, Mr. Luca.
-Think I can't write?

38:52.083 --> 38:55.667
-No, Mr. Luca! I just glanced at it.
-Don't read my fucking contracts.

39:13.375 --> 39:14.292
What day is it?

39:15.042 --> 39:17.458
The 22nd, 23rd. Something like that.

39:18.375 --> 39:21.167
If it's the 23rd,
it's my third anniversary with Julia.

39:22.208 --> 39:24.250
-Congratulations!
-Three years.

39:24.833 --> 39:26.833
I bet she's fucking another dude.

39:26.917 --> 39:27.792
Your mom…

39:28.625 --> 39:30.292
is the one fucking around.

39:30.375 --> 39:32.375
Giving blowjobs for booze.

39:34.083 --> 39:36.167
You're always talking about family,

39:36.833 --> 39:38.500
but you were sold just like me.

39:39.750 --> 39:40.958
An advance?

39:42.042 --> 39:43.417
Is that what they said?

39:44.333 --> 39:46.000
You were sold, you assholes.

39:53.958 --> 39:55.333
Do you think it's true?

39:56.333 --> 39:57.958
My mom didn't want me to come.

39:59.125 --> 40:01.625
Do you think
your mom would do that to you?

40:02.667 --> 40:03.500
No way.

40:05.083 --> 40:06.333
Forget this nonsense.

40:12.417 --> 40:13.833
<i>Here!</i>

40:15.542 --> 40:16.583
Go, Isaque.

40:20.125 --> 40:21.208
You changed again?

40:24.542 --> 40:25.375
Look.

40:26.417 --> 40:27.458
Go, Samuel.

40:28.125 --> 40:29.083
Go, Mateus.

40:29.625 --> 40:30.750
Fuck!

40:32.000 --> 40:33.375
Go, Nando. Go!

40:35.125 --> 40:37.417
Hey! Stop!

40:40.292 --> 40:41.333
Damn!

40:54.625 --> 40:55.458
Yeah?

40:58.375 --> 40:59.208
When?

41:01.542 --> 41:03.458
Stop!

41:04.042 --> 41:04.875
Get in the van!

41:06.917 --> 41:08.792
Hurry up! Get in the van!

41:09.708 --> 41:11.375
Drive around, I'll call you.

41:12.417 --> 41:14.042
Come with me.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.375
There are people coming.
They'll ask you a shitload of questions.

41:25.458 --> 41:27.542
Tell them we do it all by the book.

41:30.292 --> 41:31.792
-Got it?
-Yes, Mr. Luca.

41:38.542 --> 41:39.583
Let's go!

42:01.625 --> 42:04.583
INSPECTION

42:04.667 --> 42:05.917
-Good afternoon.
-Hello.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.333
Is Luiz Carlos de Almeida here?

42:08.917 --> 42:11.333
-Who wants to know?
-We're from the Department of Labor.

42:12.417 --> 42:14.208
-Is there a problem?
-Just routine.

42:14.292 --> 42:16.042
Let's check the staff, Oliveira?

42:16.125 --> 42:16.958
Okay.

42:18.208 --> 42:19.208
Come here, buddy.

42:21.583 --> 42:22.667
This is Mateus.

42:23.542 --> 42:24.833
-Hello.
-Hi, Mateus.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.917
-Hello.
-Do you work here?

42:27.000 --> 42:29.583
-Yes, sir.
-How long has it been?

42:29.667 --> 42:31.458
-Around six weeks.
-Yes.

42:32.625 --> 42:34.167
May I see your labor card?

42:34.250 --> 42:36.875
-It's with Mr. Luca…
-It's in the office.

42:36.958 --> 42:39.250
You should keep your documents, okay?

42:39.333 --> 42:41.000
-Yes, ma'am.
-How many employees?

42:41.083 --> 42:43.167
-Four.
-Where are they?

42:43.250 --> 42:44.875
Out, making a delivery.

42:44.958 --> 42:46.792
-Do they all sleep here?
-Yes.

42:46.875 --> 42:48.625
-There.
-I wanna see the dorm.

42:48.708 --> 42:49.542
Please.

42:50.125 --> 42:52.042
How many hours a day do you work?

42:52.125 --> 42:54.333
-Eight.
-I asked Mateus.

42:54.417 --> 42:57.667
-It's eight hours.
-How often do you work overtime?

42:57.750 --> 42:59.000
We don't work overtime.

43:04.250 --> 43:05.500
It's filthy, isn't it?

43:06.417 --> 43:08.625
You're right. We need to clean it up.

43:09.125 --> 43:10.167
This mattress

43:11.042 --> 43:12.125
is disgusting.

43:13.958 --> 43:15.125
This is falling apart.

43:16.250 --> 43:19.250
We ask Mr. Luca
to give us what he'd spend on it,

43:19.333 --> 43:21.125
'cause it helps back home.

43:39.250 --> 43:40.667
Would you like some coffee?

43:41.667 --> 43:42.875
No, thank you.

43:43.542 --> 43:45.083
Did you bring an umbrella?

43:45.167 --> 43:47.500
It's supposed to rain this afternoon.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.958
No problem, we drove here. It's fine.

43:50.042 --> 43:52.625
When it rains, we work in the workshop.

43:52.708 --> 43:55.417
-Really?
-Thank God there's a lot of work here.

43:55.958 --> 43:56.792
It's great.

43:58.333 --> 43:59.375
Thank you.

44:03.500 --> 44:05.125
Do you want some gum, boss?

44:06.500 --> 44:07.333
Thank you.

44:09.542 --> 44:10.375
Thank you.

44:13.042 --> 44:14.042
All good?

44:14.667 --> 44:16.750
No fire safety certification…

44:16.833 --> 44:18.458
<i>Why didn't you tell them?</i>

44:18.542 --> 44:20.375
He was by my side the entire time.

44:21.083 --> 44:22.333
I couldn't say anything.

44:23.417 --> 44:26.042
They had no guns, Luca did.
It was like hell.

44:26.125 --> 44:28.417
How do you think we felt in that van?

44:29.083 --> 44:31.958
Two hours not knowing where we were,
if we'd live or die.

44:37.125 --> 44:38.875
I follow orders like you all.

44:40.292 --> 44:41.958
If it were me, we'd be free.

44:43.167 --> 44:44.333
Go on, then.

44:48.458 --> 44:49.917
You're the big shot, right?

44:50.917 --> 44:51.833
Wanna kill him?

44:53.333 --> 44:54.292
Go kill him.

44:55.500 --> 44:57.833
Kill Luca, Nando, the lady at the bar.

44:59.708 --> 45:00.667
The cops.

45:01.625 --> 45:03.208
You'll have to kill them all.

45:04.833 --> 45:05.667
So?

45:06.708 --> 45:07.792
Who's first?

45:14.333 --> 45:15.167
Done.

45:20.167 --> 45:21.000
Got it.

45:21.750 --> 45:22.583
Take it out.

45:52.542 --> 45:55.000
Go! Come on, kid. Grab that thing.

45:56.583 --> 45:58.250
Go shower. We're going out.

46:00.250 --> 46:01.167
Go!

46:04.792 --> 46:06.333
Did you forget something?

46:06.833 --> 46:07.667
Go!

47:43.167 --> 47:44.542
-Hi, Luca.
-How are you?

47:44.625 --> 47:45.542
It's all good.

48:05.083 --> 48:05.917
Okay.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.875
On your feet! Come on.

48:09.125 --> 48:09.958
Let's go!

48:12.833 --> 48:14.625
These are Bolivian.

48:14.708 --> 48:15.708
Haitian.

48:16.292 --> 48:18.208
Venezuelan. Everybody's healthy.

48:20.375 --> 48:21.208
Hey, Big Luca!

48:22.125 --> 48:23.500
You wanted strong men?

48:28.375 --> 48:29.417
Pick three.

48:39.708 --> 48:40.625
It's up to you.

48:48.042 --> 48:50.000
-These three.
-Okay.

48:50.667 --> 48:53.333
Come on! Let's go! Go!

48:54.000 --> 48:55.458
Go!

48:56.583 --> 48:57.417
Walk.

48:58.042 --> 49:00.042
Here. Wait here!

49:01.750 --> 49:03.042
Please, sir.

49:03.875 --> 49:05.208
Shut up! Get in!

49:07.292 --> 49:08.625
Here, their passports.

49:14.458 --> 49:15.458
Let's go.

49:58.583 --> 50:01.292
Hey. What's up?

50:01.375 --> 50:02.208
Good.

50:06.625 --> 50:09.167
-So?
-Wow, you don't mess around.

50:11.542 --> 50:12.625
How many a day?

50:13.708 --> 50:15.250
Two thousand pieces, man.

50:23.792 --> 50:26.583
Who can assure me of that?
They all sleep here…

50:27.958 --> 50:28.792
Come here.

50:30.542 --> 50:31.375
They're here.

50:35.250 --> 50:36.083
Let's go.

50:41.167 --> 50:43.000
-Sir, let me go.
-You two, come.

50:43.500 --> 50:45.708
-Get up.
-My passport, please.

50:45.792 --> 50:46.750
Let's go.

50:46.833 --> 50:47.958
Grab your things.

50:48.042 --> 50:48.875
-Wait!
-Come.

50:48.958 --> 50:49.792
Wait, please…

50:49.875 --> 50:52.167
Grab your things. You too.

50:52.708 --> 50:53.958
Move.

50:54.042 --> 50:55.208
Go on. Move.

50:55.833 --> 50:57.542
-Go!
-Where are you taking me?

51:08.875 --> 51:09.708
Go!

51:09.792 --> 51:11.417
Help!

51:11.500 --> 51:12.542
Help!

51:12.625 --> 51:13.458
Get him!

51:20.333 --> 51:21.333
Bring him here.

51:25.167 --> 51:26.458
I'm gonna do something.

51:26.542 --> 51:28.583
If you try to escape,

51:28.667 --> 51:30.292
the police will kill you.

51:36.625 --> 51:38.083
He understands it now.

51:38.667 --> 51:40.917
Big Luca, always a pleasure.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.417
-Let's go.
-You're good, kid.

51:44.125 --> 51:44.958
You're good.

52:25.542 --> 52:26.375
Take them.

52:28.083 --> 52:30.167
It's $10k each. Don't fuck around.

52:30.250 --> 52:33.083
-Come on. Go.
-Don't come back without the money.

52:45.375 --> 52:47.083
Who are you? Where's Luca?

52:47.667 --> 52:48.583
Where's Luca?

52:50.000 --> 52:51.375
He's downstairs.

52:51.458 --> 52:52.792
Go check downstairs.

52:52.875 --> 52:54.333
Go!

52:58.417 --> 52:59.667
Please, sir…

53:01.208 --> 53:02.042
The money?

53:02.125 --> 53:05.208
Tell him to come and get it.
I know he wants it.

53:06.208 --> 53:09.125
Luca can come and get it. Leave, now.

53:09.792 --> 53:11.917
It's $10k each. Gimme the money.

53:17.375 --> 53:20.250
Have you lost your mind?
Do you want to get shot?

53:20.333 --> 53:23.917
Are you crazy? Take him out now!
Crazy little shit.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.875
He told me to kill you.
Do you want to die here?

53:28.208 --> 53:31.167
Do it. Luca will kill me
if I don't bring him the money.

53:31.875 --> 53:33.250
But he'll kill you too.

53:34.792 --> 53:35.750
Did you hear me?

53:36.917 --> 53:38.333
Luca will kill us both.

53:43.250 --> 53:45.750
Tell Luca to go fuck himself, little shit!

53:48.542 --> 53:51.000
Stop messing around!
Show some respect! Go!

53:51.958 --> 53:53.083
Get the fuck out!

54:14.000 --> 54:14.833
I'm listening.

54:20.458 --> 54:22.167
Bro, who's gonna pay?

54:23.125 --> 54:24.833
Who's gonna pay?

54:43.292 --> 54:45.375
-Okay.
-Mr. Luca.

54:54.208 --> 54:55.292
How much do you want?

54:56.500 --> 54:57.333
Say it.

54:58.375 --> 54:59.208
Half.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Ten grand?

55:10.542 --> 55:12.083
This is the boss's cut.

55:12.667 --> 55:14.667
-Five hundred.
-One grand.

55:26.292 --> 55:27.625
How did they get here?

55:29.000 --> 55:31.458
By plane, bus, ship.

55:32.792 --> 55:34.083
Like everything we buy.

55:35.792 --> 55:36.917
How many are there?

55:41.667 --> 55:43.583
Enough to keep the city running.

55:46.500 --> 55:47.458
Do you see that?

55:48.333 --> 55:50.167
Copper wire from our junkyard.

55:52.833 --> 55:53.708
Look.

55:53.792 --> 55:55.625
That's your work all over town.

56:51.833 --> 56:52.667
Come on.

56:57.292 --> 56:58.417
Get him out of there.

57:03.708 --> 57:05.958
Sir, please, don't hurt him.

57:07.083 --> 57:08.083
He's just scared.

57:28.167 --> 57:29.000
Go.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.125
You sleep here now.

57:49.792 --> 57:50.792
There's no need.

57:52.167 --> 57:54.375
He'll stab you in the eye
when you're asleep.

57:57.750 --> 57:58.750
I'm sure of that.

57:59.750 --> 58:01.500
How long have you been doing it?

58:02.000 --> 58:03.042
Long enough.

58:04.542 --> 58:05.958
Has anyone ever escaped?

58:09.042 --> 58:10.000
Not from me.

58:11.708 --> 58:13.458
Let's see how it goes with you.

58:18.875 --> 58:21.792
Mr. Luca, thanks for all this,
but I can't.

58:23.375 --> 58:24.208
Why is that?

58:28.417 --> 58:29.542
I won't do it.

58:30.583 --> 58:32.542
I won't keep them captive or hurt them.

58:36.000 --> 58:36.833
Okay.

58:38.417 --> 58:39.250
Go back, then.

58:39.875 --> 58:40.708
Go.

58:42.542 --> 58:43.750
Go back to your friends.

58:44.875 --> 58:46.375
Someone else will do it.

58:50.750 --> 58:52.583
I don't know how you can do it.

58:54.917 --> 58:56.167
You're doing it too.

58:56.833 --> 58:58.250
Not because I want to.

58:58.917 --> 59:01.042
We have a deal. After that, I'm free.

59:01.125 --> 59:01.958
Free?

59:04.542 --> 59:05.500
To do what?

59:07.417 --> 59:08.250
Starve?

59:09.667 --> 59:11.292
See your family live in squalor?

59:11.958 --> 59:13.208
I saw your magazines.

59:15.333 --> 59:16.625
You wanted to be a pilot?

59:17.375 --> 59:18.667
-Engineer.
-Nice.

59:20.917 --> 59:22.292
Important job.

59:23.042 --> 59:24.167
I wanted that too.

59:25.500 --> 59:27.458
Why don't you do something else, then?

59:35.667 --> 59:37.583
I came from a shithole, just like you.

59:38.833 --> 59:41.125
Raised in a shack next to an open sewer.

59:41.917 --> 59:45.292
My mom worked her ass off
to provide for four kids. Alone.

59:46.750 --> 59:49.250
Her boss, a very good man,

59:49.333 --> 59:50.708
treated us like family.

59:52.833 --> 59:55.292
But he'd force her to work 12 hours a day

59:55.375 --> 59:56.792
and paid $600 a month.

59:57.917 --> 1:00:00.000
The fucker's shoes cost more than that.

1:00:03.708 --> 1:00:05.333
Is that the freedom you want?

1:00:10.167 --> 1:00:11.167
There's the door.

1:00:13.583 --> 1:00:14.667
Go, be free.

1:01:14.542 --> 1:01:16.167
Look who showed up.

1:01:18.792 --> 1:01:20.542
Will you take us out of here?

1:01:20.625 --> 1:01:21.750
Open this shit!

1:01:22.667 --> 1:01:23.875
Did you choose them?

1:01:24.667 --> 1:01:25.625
Say it.

1:01:25.708 --> 1:01:27.667
Yes, he brought me here.

1:01:27.750 --> 1:01:29.375
Are you a badass now?

1:01:30.542 --> 1:01:33.542
-Do you know how to use that shit?
-Get back, Isaque.

1:01:37.875 --> 1:01:38.792
Come, Samuel.

1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:47.458
He's out there.

1:01:48.250 --> 1:01:49.333
Help me with them.

1:01:50.083 --> 1:01:52.125
I'm doing my best to get us out of here.

1:01:58.250 --> 1:01:59.083
Move!

1:02:00.958 --> 1:02:02.458
Open it, everybody out.

1:02:06.667 --> 1:02:07.500
Let's go.

1:02:09.458 --> 1:02:10.292
Go, faster!

1:02:48.875 --> 1:02:49.708
Pure copper.

1:02:50.667 --> 1:02:52.667
Copper goes here, rubber there.

1:02:53.208 --> 1:02:54.042
Got it?

1:03:04.875 --> 1:03:06.958
You have to move this shit, not me.

1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:09.000
Get to work. Hurry up.

1:03:53.042 --> 1:03:54.750
<i>Do you guys need anything?</i>

1:03:55.292 --> 1:03:57.208
Isaque was right about you.

1:03:57.292 --> 1:03:58.542
I didn't choose this.

1:03:59.500 --> 1:04:01.375
What should I do? Tell him I can't?

1:04:02.042 --> 1:04:02.875
Yes.

1:04:03.458 --> 1:04:05.708
You'd rather have him watching us?

1:04:06.375 --> 1:04:07.542
I'm one of you.

1:04:09.250 --> 1:04:10.958
I can talk to your family.

1:04:11.625 --> 1:04:13.833
I can call your mom. Julia.

1:04:15.083 --> 1:04:18.042
-I'll talk to the others.
-To who? Isaque?

1:04:20.875 --> 1:04:22.000
Forget him, Samuel.

1:04:22.958 --> 1:04:24.375
He'll make things worse.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.333
We're from the same place.

1:04:27.792 --> 1:04:28.625
Okay.

1:04:29.917 --> 1:04:31.042
And the deal?

1:04:33.250 --> 1:04:35.167
I can get us out of here even earlier.

1:04:51.333 --> 1:04:52.333
You'll need this.

1:04:53.667 --> 1:04:55.917
I added my number, Nando's and Batista's.

1:04:58.625 --> 1:05:00.167
You can call your mom too.

1:05:03.208 --> 1:05:04.333
Go ahead, call her.

1:05:17.042 --> 1:05:18.500
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Mom?

1:05:18.583 --> 1:05:20.458
<i>Mateus? Where are you?</i>

1:05:20.542 --> 1:05:22.917
<i>I've been trying to call,</i>
<i>but you didn't answer.</i>

1:05:23.458 --> 1:05:26.292
This is my new number, Mom.
I forgot to tell you.

1:05:26.792 --> 1:05:30.417
<i>How can you disappear?</i>
<i>You send money and don't say anything?</i>

1:05:31.292 --> 1:05:32.250
What money, Mom?

1:05:32.875 --> 1:05:35.208
<i>The money you sent me, son.</i>

1:05:35.292 --> 1:05:37.333
<i>How did you make that much money?</i>

1:05:39.417 --> 1:05:41.333
I've been doing some extra work.

1:05:41.417 --> 1:05:43.000
<i>How are the other boys?</i>

1:05:44.875 --> 1:05:47.375
-They're fine, thank God.
<i>-Call me again.</i>

1:05:47.458 --> 1:05:49.125
<i>We miss you.</i>

1:05:49.208 --> 1:05:50.042
I will, Mom.

1:05:50.625 --> 1:05:52.333
-Bye.
<i>-Call me.</i>

1:05:58.375 --> 1:05:59.833
I sent her $4,000.

1:06:02.542 --> 1:06:03.625
You've earned it.

1:06:05.042 --> 1:06:06.583
That's just the beginning.

1:06:30.125 --> 1:06:32.708
-Drink it. I'm buying.
-It's really good.

1:06:33.417 --> 1:06:34.250
Look.

1:06:35.250 --> 1:06:36.750
-Hey!
-Sorry, sir.

1:06:36.833 --> 1:06:39.458
-Do you make him call you "sir"?
-So what?

1:06:40.375 --> 1:06:41.792
Is that how you talk to him?

1:06:42.583 --> 1:06:44.292
You must control him, got it?

1:06:44.375 --> 1:06:45.750
Yes, I will.

1:06:46.417 --> 1:06:48.833
What did you do
in the countryside for fun?

1:06:49.875 --> 1:06:52.833
-Give me a cigarette.
-Cool. I like that.

1:06:52.917 --> 1:06:53.750
Here.

1:07:04.750 --> 1:07:05.875
A beer, please.

1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.917
So? You must bring your mom
to meet her daughter-in-law.

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.417
-Mom wouldn't get used to São Paulo.
-Really?

1:07:31.625 --> 1:07:32.875
Will you leave her there?

1:07:33.375 --> 1:07:34.625
She'd want to say.

1:07:35.458 --> 1:07:37.500
But she must quit working,
or she'll die.

1:07:37.583 --> 1:07:40.292
-I don't know how she does it.
-And your father?

1:07:41.292 --> 1:07:42.125
Father?

1:07:43.417 --> 1:07:45.458
When I have kids, I'll be a good father.

1:07:45.958 --> 1:07:47.458
Do you want kids?

1:07:47.542 --> 1:07:48.375
Four.

1:07:49.250 --> 1:07:50.458
Two girls, two boys.

1:07:51.292 --> 1:07:54.542
You'll take care of your kids,
your mom, everything.

1:08:04.500 --> 1:08:05.875
Cheers!

1:09:09.375 --> 1:09:11.083
Get us some beers, will you?

1:09:27.875 --> 1:09:28.708
Mr. Luca…

1:09:32.542 --> 1:09:33.375
Mr. Luca?

1:09:34.208 --> 1:09:35.042
Mr. Luca?

1:11:42.250 --> 1:11:44.375
Eat it before he sees it.

1:11:49.042 --> 1:11:50.333
Did you have a fun night?

1:11:50.833 --> 1:11:53.625
Where's Luca?
Does he let you come and go now?

1:11:54.708 --> 1:11:58.000
-Where's Luca? Answer me, damn it!
-He's right there.

1:11:58.792 --> 1:12:01.167
-In the office.
-The asshole must've passed out.

1:12:01.250 --> 1:12:03.875
This one left a free man,

1:12:03.958 --> 1:12:05.625
and came back a free man.

1:12:05.708 --> 1:12:06.625
Is that true?

1:12:07.458 --> 1:12:08.458
Answer, Mateus.

1:12:11.875 --> 1:12:14.167
Eat, we have work to do. Hurry up.

1:13:01.750 --> 1:13:02.583
Okay.

1:13:29.167 --> 1:13:31.792
-Sing something.
-Sing, Samuel.

1:13:40.833 --> 1:13:44.125
BIANCHI = FUTURE

1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:46.250
What's up, Big Luca?

1:13:47.583 --> 1:13:49.167
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

1:14:04.208 --> 1:14:05.333
Let me take a look.

1:14:06.833 --> 1:14:08.208
All right, legs apart.

1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.083
-Excuse me.
-Hey.

1:14:30.125 --> 1:14:32.250
-How are you?
-Hi, Luca. How are you?

1:14:35.042 --> 1:14:37.000
A gift for your daughter, Mr. Bianchi.

1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:38.750
You shouldn't have.

1:14:39.417 --> 1:14:40.250
Take it inside.

1:14:40.333 --> 1:14:41.667
-Thank you.
-Sit down.

1:14:45.875 --> 1:14:47.083
Get Rodiney for me.

1:14:49.958 --> 1:14:51.042
Here's the deal.

1:14:51.125 --> 1:14:53.458
I have to focus on my campaign.

1:14:53.542 --> 1:14:55.333
I'll give you the office keys.

1:14:55.833 --> 1:14:57.625
You're out of the junkyard.

1:14:57.708 --> 1:15:00.042
I want you out on the front line
of the business.

1:15:01.750 --> 1:15:04.083
You'll do the rounds day and night,

1:15:04.167 --> 1:15:06.958
check productivity, schedule workers.

1:15:07.042 --> 1:15:08.667
Then you report back to me.

1:15:10.292 --> 1:15:11.500
You can count on me.

1:15:14.792 --> 1:15:16.583
Look, this is Rodiney.

1:15:17.167 --> 1:15:19.083
He'll take over the junkyard.

1:15:19.708 --> 1:15:20.583
Cool.

1:15:21.083 --> 1:15:22.208
No more easy life.

1:15:23.125 --> 1:15:24.750
That's it. Enjoy the party.

1:15:32.208 --> 1:15:34.292
-Hi. How are you?
-How are you?

1:15:34.375 --> 1:15:38.917
There's a song by Noel Rosa I like a lot
called "Fita Amarela". Do you know it?

1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.417
-So…
-"Fita Amalera." I mean, "Fita Amarela."

1:15:49.875 --> 1:15:51.083
Don't move.

1:15:51.167 --> 1:15:52.750
Hey, what are you doing?

1:15:53.833 --> 1:15:55.500
-There's no one here.
-Right.

1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:59.375
Go play with your friends.
Tell Cida to hide in the kitchen.

1:15:59.875 --> 1:16:00.708
Goodness…

1:16:00.792 --> 1:16:02.417
-Your daughter?
-Yeah.

1:16:03.125 --> 1:16:05.042
-Do you like kids?
-I do, sir.

1:16:05.125 --> 1:16:07.833
I got into politics because of them.

1:16:07.917 --> 1:16:10.500
I want to make this country
a better place for them.

1:16:10.583 --> 1:16:12.667
-You're with Luca, right?
-Yes.

1:16:13.167 --> 1:16:15.167
-Have you known him a long time?
-Yes.

1:16:15.250 --> 1:16:17.583
My father had businesses in Itaquera.

1:16:18.167 --> 1:16:20.583
I ended up taking over the businesses,

1:16:20.667 --> 1:16:23.750
and I needed someone
to bring me food and stuff, right?

1:16:24.250 --> 1:16:25.250
Then I saw him.

1:16:25.792 --> 1:16:27.708
He stood out from the others.

1:16:28.917 --> 1:16:31.167
I just needed to whistle like this…

1:16:36.250 --> 1:16:37.458
Been with me ever since.

1:16:50.458 --> 1:16:52.500
Those people we bought, they work for him?

1:16:59.583 --> 1:17:01.500
Has anyone got a deal like ours?

1:17:04.542 --> 1:17:05.667
You got lucky, kid.

1:17:09.083 --> 1:17:10.417
I mean, the other guys.

1:17:15.708 --> 1:17:16.542
No deal?

1:17:21.125 --> 1:17:22.958
Won't they get out once they pay up?

1:17:30.542 --> 1:17:32.500
Next week, I'm leaving the junkyard.

1:17:33.125 --> 1:17:35.125
If you want a promotion, there's a spot.

1:17:37.333 --> 1:17:38.500
Otherwise, stay there.

1:17:40.417 --> 1:17:41.333
It's up to you.

1:18:24.500 --> 1:18:26.250
That was the issue…

1:18:33.167 --> 1:18:35.875
Your beard is getting grayer, son.

1:18:36.917 --> 1:18:37.958
Who is this one?

1:18:40.167 --> 1:18:42.542
He works with me. Mateus.

1:18:43.125 --> 1:18:45.083
-So young?
-Not as young as you, ma'am.

1:18:45.833 --> 1:18:48.750
-Pleasure to meet you.
-A silver-tongued boy, huh?

1:18:49.833 --> 1:18:51.958
-No need for "ma'am."
-Off to the restroom.

1:18:52.042 --> 1:18:53.667
Okay. Your siblings are coming.

1:18:53.750 --> 1:18:57.333
It's a miracle he showed up.
He works so hard.

1:18:57.417 --> 1:18:59.500
But he shows up once in a while!

1:18:59.583 --> 1:19:02.208
Help him get in good spirits.

1:19:02.292 --> 1:19:04.667
-It's a lost cause.
-Look who's coming.

1:19:04.750 --> 1:19:06.917
-There she is.
-Hello.

1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:08.083
Thanks, Edileuza.

1:19:08.167 --> 1:19:10.292
-There you go!
-Enjoy.

1:19:10.375 --> 1:19:12.333
That's not how I raised you.

1:19:12.417 --> 1:19:14.792
Guests first. Go ahead.

1:19:14.875 --> 1:19:17.000
You'll eat the best coxinha ever.

1:19:17.083 --> 1:19:19.542
This is what keeps
this place running. Here.

1:19:19.625 --> 1:19:20.750
-Wait for it…
-Eat it.

1:19:23.458 --> 1:19:24.292
Tears of joy!

1:19:25.500 --> 1:19:26.333
Am I right?

1:19:26.958 --> 1:19:29.958
He keeps this place running.
He bought the bakery for me.

1:19:30.042 --> 1:19:32.458
How many moms can say that? I can.

1:19:32.542 --> 1:19:34.333
So? How's Ana?

1:19:34.417 --> 1:19:37.875
Tell him, Mazinho. She doesn't want kids.

1:19:37.958 --> 1:19:40.375
-Bitch.
-Mom, let him be. Forget it.

1:19:40.458 --> 1:19:43.875
-I do, but she doesn't.
-Soon you'll be surrounded by grandkids.

1:19:43.958 --> 1:19:45.333
-Really? I will?
-No.

1:19:45.417 --> 1:19:47.792
Where are they? Bring me my grandkids.

1:19:48.292 --> 1:19:50.417
-They're hiding.
-I'll look for one.

1:19:51.333 --> 1:19:53.833
Moms just want
what's best for their kids.

1:19:54.625 --> 1:19:58.042
I want the best for them.
Doesn't your mom want that, too?

1:19:58.125 --> 1:19:59.792
Exactly. What does she do?

1:19:59.875 --> 1:20:01.417
She works in the fields.

1:20:01.500 --> 1:20:03.167
I did that for a long time.

1:20:03.250 --> 1:20:05.250
-Are you from the countryside?
-No.

1:20:05.333 --> 1:20:08.083
We lived in Rio, in the middle of nowhere.

1:20:09.042 --> 1:20:10.375
Up on a slope.

1:20:10.458 --> 1:20:14.792
We came to São Paulo when Luca
was a teenager, 13, 14 years old.

1:20:15.583 --> 1:20:17.583
Was he a handful?

1:20:17.667 --> 1:20:19.083
No, not Luca.

1:20:20.125 --> 1:20:22.250
Luca was never afraid of anything.

1:20:22.333 --> 1:20:24.583
He used to steal the boss's horses,

1:20:25.625 --> 1:20:27.500
run away in the middle of the night.

1:20:27.583 --> 1:20:29.167
He sold the boss's chickens,

1:20:29.250 --> 1:20:31.042
but he never lied to me. Ever.

1:20:31.125 --> 1:20:33.417
He always brought home the money.

1:20:34.208 --> 1:20:35.458
A golden boy.

1:20:35.542 --> 1:20:38.958
He was born to be a leader.
Whatever he says is the law.

1:20:39.042 --> 1:20:41.083
Stand by him and you'll do well.

1:20:42.083 --> 1:20:43.292
So, you were a peasant?

1:20:44.250 --> 1:20:47.750
No, that's not… I didn't say that.

1:20:47.833 --> 1:20:51.083
-One beer and you're tipsy?
-No, that's a lie!

1:20:51.167 --> 1:20:54.125
-I didn't say that.
-All right.

1:20:54.208 --> 1:20:55.083
Give me some.

1:21:14.792 --> 1:21:17.625
There's a shipment next week.
Copper wire and stainless steel.

1:21:17.708 --> 1:21:19.667
-Got it.
-You can come and get it.

1:21:20.417 --> 1:21:21.958
Hey, look!

1:21:22.042 --> 1:21:23.375
-Grab him!
-Get him!

1:21:23.458 --> 1:21:25.292
-Luca!
-Luca!

1:21:25.375 --> 1:21:27.083
The guy escaped!

1:22:37.958 --> 1:22:39.167
Call Batista.

1:22:43.917 --> 1:22:45.083
Show him the picture.

1:22:46.917 --> 1:22:48.042
It's not necessary.

1:22:55.667 --> 1:22:56.750
It's them or us.

1:22:57.625 --> 1:22:58.458
Make the call.

1:23:18.292 --> 1:23:20.000
<i>-Who is it?</i>
-Mateus.

1:23:20.542 --> 1:23:22.417
<i>What's up? What do you need?</i>

1:23:22.500 --> 1:23:25.125
-One of the guys tried to run away.
<i>-Who?</i>

1:23:25.958 --> 1:23:28.042
-Samuel.
<i>-What do you want?</i>

1:23:28.833 --> 1:23:30.125
Stop by his house.

1:23:30.208 --> 1:23:31.333
<i>Should I be rough?</i>

1:23:32.292 --> 1:23:33.125
No.

1:23:34.125 --> 1:23:35.292
Give them a scare.

1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:08.875
TELL SAMUEL
HIS MOTHER SAYS HI

1:24:18.583 --> 1:24:19.667
Say "Portuguese."

1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:21.917
Portuguese.

1:24:30.208 --> 1:24:31.167
I didn't want this.
