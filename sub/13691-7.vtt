WEBVTT

00:04.243 --> 00:05.786
Now you will tell Lizzie
that I'm sorry

00:05.869 --> 00:07.455
I can't be there, but
what with everything here...

00:07.539 --> 00:09.331
I'm sure she'll understand.

00:09.415 --> 00:12.460
-I'll give you a call as
soon as there's any news.
-Right.

00:12.544 --> 00:16.004
All the best, Molly.
Bring back
a bucking son and heir!

00:16.088 --> 00:20.135
I'll try. Oh, darling,
are you absolutely
sure you won't come?

00:20.218 --> 00:23.387
Childbirth's not really
my bag, darling. All that
yelling and thrashing about.

00:23.470 --> 00:25.473
I'll give you a call as
soon as we get to London.

00:25.557 --> 00:28.225
I expect a full report.
Height, weight,
condition of teeth and so on.

00:28.309 --> 00:31.271
I don't think new-born babies
are supposed to
have any teeth.

00:31.354 --> 00:33.063
I mean the father!

00:33.147 --> 00:36.484
Find out when the bum is gonna
make an honest
woman of my daughter!

00:37.777 --> 00:39.361
(GROANING)

00:41.155 --> 00:43.450
-Are you all right back there?
-Just about.

00:43.533 --> 00:45.826
Listen, why don't
you give them a call?

00:45.910 --> 00:49.998
-Tell 'em you're coming home.
-I'd rather do
this face-to-face. Oh!

00:50.081 --> 00:52.583
-Hold on!
-Good! We're late!

00:54.544 --> 00:56.379
Foot down, Duncan.

00:56.463 --> 00:58.589
KILWILLIE: So you
still haven't met the sire?

00:58.672 --> 01:01.927
She found him after she
left that weirdo Gerald.

01:02.010 --> 01:03.802
He's something in
the wine trade apparently.

01:03.886 --> 01:05.763
Oh, capital.
But is he going to marry her?

01:13.605 --> 01:15.606
Someone remind me
why I employ that boy.

01:26.575 --> 01:28.160
Can't be far now.

01:33.540 --> 01:36.044
-Have you gone completely mad?
-Me?

01:36.126 --> 01:38.296
This is a private drive,
not Brand's Hatch!

01:39.004 --> 01:40.880
(LIZZIE GROANS)

01:40.965 --> 01:42.342
Hello, Mummy.

01:43.717 --> 01:45.427
Lizzie, darling.

01:45.510 --> 01:48.056
-I think I'm
gonna have the baby.
-Oh, my.

02:28.137 --> 02:33.934
HECTOR: It was Archie's idea
to use the old boathouse.
Quite bright really.

02:34.018 --> 02:38.064
So what do you think,
Kilwillie?
Brave new world, eh?

02:38.148 --> 02:40.608
Well, it's certainly a
lot bigger than I thought
it was gonna be.

02:40.691 --> 02:44.945
Yes, Archie's come up trumps.
Chip off the old block, what?

02:45.029 --> 02:47.489
-Hmm.
-Well, come on, old man,

02:47.573 --> 02:50.783
-you haven't seen
the half of it yet.
-I can't wait.

02:54.039 --> 02:55.832
So what time's the
journo coming?

02:55.916 --> 02:58.000
He's already here,
nosing around the place.

02:58.082 --> 03:00.003
You sure you can't join us?

03:00.086 --> 03:03.756
Sorry, Arch, I've just got a
million things to do before
tomorrow, you know.

03:03.839 --> 03:05.341
Packing and stuff.

03:05.424 --> 03:08.053
Actually, I was gonna ask you,
and Katrina of course,

03:08.136 --> 03:12.432
if you'd like to come to
supper tonight? You know,
give you a proper send-off.

03:12.515 --> 03:16.185
-Of course, if you're busy...
-No, no, that'd be great.

03:16.268 --> 03:18.271
-We'd both love to come.
-Good.

03:18.355 --> 03:20.564
-8:00, then?
-See you later.

03:23.025 --> 03:24.653
HECTOR: So we're trying to
create a place

03:24.736 --> 03:26.487
where there's something
for everyone to enjoy.

03:26.570 --> 03:28.864
-You will put that in
the Gazette, won't you?
-Aye.

03:28.948 --> 03:31.660
-Name is Hector...
-Naismith MacDonald.

03:31.743 --> 03:34.912
Exactly.
My good friend and neighbour,
Lord Kilwillie.

03:34.995 --> 03:37.457
-It's a big spread, is it?
-If there's a story.

03:37.540 --> 03:40.209
Oh,
there's a story, all right.
This is my son, Archie.

03:40.292 --> 03:42.337
Campbell McCrory,
Strathspey Gazette.

03:42.420 --> 03:44.047
Pleased to meet you.
I trust that...

03:44.130 --> 03:46.507
Shall we go and see
your secret weapon?

03:46.590 --> 03:49.427
Secret weapon?
What secret weapon?

03:49.511 --> 03:52.680
All in good time, Kilwillie.
All in good time.

03:56.392 --> 03:58.185
She's been having contractions
since Pitlochry.

03:58.269 --> 04:00.522
Come on,darling,
we're nearly there.

04:00.605 --> 04:02.982
Blimey, I didn't know
I was driving royalty.

04:03.065 --> 04:05.234
-Lex, I think you'd
better call the midwife.
-Call her what?

04:05.317 --> 04:07.571
Oh. No, don't bother, Lex.

04:08.445 --> 04:10.364
What is it, darling?

04:10.447 --> 04:13.577
Do you know,
it's the strangest feeling.

04:13.660 --> 04:18.415
I think they've stopped.
They've just
completely stopped.

04:18.498 --> 04:21.750
Come on, sweetheart.
Slowly now. That's it.

04:23.752 --> 04:25.297
(CABBIE WHISTLING)

04:25.380 --> 04:28.465
Why didn't you telephone,
let us know you were coming?

04:28.548 --> 04:32.928
Spur of the moment thing.
I just knew I wanted my
baby to be born at home,

04:33.012 --> 04:36.766
-so I jumped on
a train and here I am.
-Oh, how lovely.

04:36.850 --> 04:41.353
You're coming back to spawn
at the place of your birth,
just like a salmon.

04:41.437 --> 04:45.357
-I understand completely.
-I'm not in the way, am I?

04:45.441 --> 04:48.528
I know Archie's got other
things on his mind, what with
the opening and so on.

04:48.612 --> 04:52.531
-More than that,
to tell you the truth.
-Oh? Do tell.

04:52.615 --> 04:54.701
Katrina's leaving Glenbogle.

04:54.784 --> 04:57.202
-You're kidding! When?
-Tomorrow.

04:57.286 --> 04:59.663
-Oh!
-Quick, quick, quick, quick.

05:00.624 --> 05:02.499
No, no, no, I'm fine.

05:02.583 --> 05:04.668
Now, Miss MacLean
is going to be in
charge next year

05:04.752 --> 05:08.256
and she's promised to tell me
how all you lot are behaving.

05:08.339 --> 05:14.095
So, when the bell goes, I want
you to walk, slowly, down the
corridor and get your stuff.

05:15.679 --> 05:19.267
-Yes, Sandy?
-What's so great
about New Zealand, Miss?

05:19.351 --> 05:22.478
Well, it's very beautiful.

05:22.561 --> 05:28.150
And it's got lots of great
things there, like mountains
and lakes and wildlife.

05:28.776 --> 05:30.195
How far is it?

05:30.278 --> 05:32.613
Come up here
and I'll show you.

05:35.784 --> 05:37.619
Right, we're here.

05:37.702 --> 05:41.538
And tomorrow, I've got to go
to Edinburgh to catch
the sleeper to London,

05:41.622 --> 05:43.375
which is where I get my visa.

05:43.458 --> 05:47.628
And then I catch
a flight all the way...

05:49.214 --> 05:51.799
-to New Zealand.
-That's miles, Miss.

05:51.882 --> 05:53.259
I know.

05:55.345 --> 05:57.680
Oh, we'll have it put
back just the way it was

05:57.763 --> 06:00.600
and you can have your baby
right here in your old room.

06:00.684 --> 06:02.643
-Do you want this put in here?
-Oh, thank you.

06:02.725 --> 06:08.191
Do you know, I had all three
of my children in this house
on that very beanbag.

06:08.274 --> 06:10.859
I'll go and get
the rest of your stuff.

06:10.943 --> 06:12.862
He seems a nice
enough young man.

06:12.946 --> 06:15.906
He is, certainly
compared to what I'm used to.

06:15.990 --> 06:18.868
Will Donald be joining us?

06:18.952 --> 06:21.370
-It's David.
-Of course.

06:22.288 --> 06:23.748
No, he won't.

06:24.916 --> 06:26.417
It's a long story.

06:27.334 --> 06:30.338
I rather thought it might be.

06:30.422 --> 06:34.508
Why don't you tell me
and then I can
prime your father?

06:44.768 --> 06:48.898
Our head ranger discovered
that the Woodland Trust is
organising a competition.

06:48.982 --> 06:53.402
There's a big cash prize, of
course, and it would be great
publicity for us if we win.

06:53.485 --> 06:55.447
So, Kilwillie, what do
you think of that, eh?

06:55.530 --> 06:58.782
Proud symbol of
the renaissance
of the MacDonald family.

06:58.866 --> 07:03.871
I'm sorry,
what kind of competition
are we talking about here?

07:03.954 --> 07:10.252
Gentlemen, we very much hope
that what you're looking at is
the tallest tree in Scotland.

07:12.380 --> 07:15.382
-Oh, no, you're not, you know.
-I beg your pardon?

07:16.258 --> 07:18.470
Oh, no. Not by a long chalk.

07:29.981 --> 07:33.233
Tree comp goes pear-shaped.
No, no.

07:33.317 --> 07:35.611
All's fir in love and war.

07:44.536 --> 07:49.209
This is it. This is
the tallest tree in Scotland.

07:49.292 --> 07:51.293
-Rubbish!
-It's an absolute monster.

07:51.377 --> 07:53.838
-You can see for yourself.
-A mere sapling!

07:53.922 --> 07:56.632
Don't worry,
it's an open competition.
The judges will decide.

07:56.715 --> 07:58.842
It's blatant treachery.
He's stolen your idea.

07:58.926 --> 08:01.054
How dare you?
I've never stolen
anything in my life!

08:01.137 --> 08:02.763
That's your story.

08:02.846 --> 08:04.932
Well, there's
an easy way to prove it.

08:05.015 --> 08:07.310
-William?
-Yes, Your Lordship?

08:07.394 --> 08:10.312
There's a modest little pine
on the neighbouring estate.

08:10.396 --> 08:12.315
It's a bit of a shrimp really,
but perhaps

08:12.399 --> 08:14.733
you would be so good
as to go measure it for me?

08:14.817 --> 08:17.444
-Right you are, sir.
-Certainly not!
Who the devil are you?

08:17.528 --> 08:20.073
This is William, my new man.

08:20.155 --> 08:23.075
Golly, if you see this oik
within 50 yards of my tree,

08:23.158 --> 08:25.829
-you have my permission
to shoot him on sight.
-Right you are, boss.

08:25.912 --> 08:28.872
-And who might you be?
-They call me Golly.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.835
Golly the gillie.

08:32.918 --> 08:36.381
That is my name, friend.
Don't wear it out.

08:36.464 --> 08:39.258
So you'll be
Kilwillie's new gillie, Billy.

08:41.302 --> 08:45.306
Face facts, Hector. You're
just fizzing because my tree's
taller than yours.

08:45.389 --> 08:47.976
-It is not!
-It is so! It's much taller.

08:48.059 --> 08:49.269
All right, that is enough.

08:49.352 --> 08:50.519
-Not!
-Is!

08:50.601 --> 08:52.896
-Not!
-It jolly well is
and you know it!

08:52.980 --> 08:56.357
Very well, we'll just
have to find out, won't we?

08:58.861 --> 09:02.197
A centuries old
tribal enmity rekindled.

09:02.281 --> 09:04.033
Steady on, mate.

09:04.116 --> 09:05.492
Come on.

09:05.577 --> 09:08.704
Clan warfare has
returned to Glenbogle.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.629
-Thanks very much. Bye-bye.
-No problem.

09:16.712 --> 09:18.965
-Thanks a lot.
Have a good summer.
-Good luck.

09:19.049 --> 09:21.884
I'm never going to be
able to do all that.
Head teacher.

09:21.967 --> 09:24.471
You are going to be brilliant.

09:24.554 --> 09:28.557
You can still change your
mind, you know. I can always
get a job somewhere else.

09:28.641 --> 09:30.477
I don't why you're
feeling so sorry for me for.

09:30.560 --> 09:34.188
I am going to
a beautiful place
with a wonderful man.

09:34.271 --> 09:38.233
-I mean, what can
be so bad about that?
-And Archie?

09:38.317 --> 09:40.319
Haven't heard from him
since Fergal told him.

09:40.402 --> 09:43.240
Do you think
he's avoiding you?

09:43.323 --> 09:47.953
I think it's more
likely he couldn't care less.

09:48.036 --> 09:52.206
-It is just a tree, after all.
-How much did I
spend on your education?

09:52.289 --> 09:54.417
It's a totem! The clan of the
MacDonalds

09:54.501 --> 09:56.710
against the
snivelling loyalists of
Kilwillie castle.

09:56.794 --> 10:00.966
-Hector! Molly's
told me to tell you...
-Never mind that now!

10:01.049 --> 10:03.717
Get yourself a shotgun,
some ammunition
and a sleeping bag...

10:03.801 --> 10:06.054
-But...
-...and guard
Archie's tree with your life.

10:06.137 --> 10:08.847
If I know my neighbour,
its continued good
health is in jeopardy.

10:08.931 --> 10:11.183
-Okay, Hector.
-And before you go,

10:11.267 --> 10:14.520
can you explain why
a Hackney Carriage
is parked on my drive?

10:14.603 --> 10:17.231
That's what I've
been trying to tell you.

10:17.314 --> 10:18.775
Lizzie's here!

10:18.858 --> 10:20.150
What?

10:23.905 --> 10:25.907
She's in her old bedroom.

10:28.158 --> 10:30.245
So, you must be the man.

10:30.328 --> 10:33.205
-If you say so.
-I've been waiting
a long time to meet you.

10:33.289 --> 10:35.291
I'm Lizzie's father,
head of the family.

10:35.374 --> 10:37.502
Oh, right.
Pleased to meet you, sir.

10:37.586 --> 10:41.715
Never mind the "sir".
In the circumstances,
you may call me Hector.

10:47.887 --> 10:51.265
Look,
I'm nervous about this, too,
if it's any consolation.

10:51.348 --> 10:53.727
I wouldn't have thought
you got nervous
about anything.

10:53.810 --> 10:56.145
Hey, half man, half jellyfish.

10:57.479 --> 11:00.191
Well, I'm all jellyfish.

11:00.275 --> 11:03.777
Come on, it's scary.
Of course it is.

11:03.861 --> 11:07.365
What you do every day,
teaching a class of kids,
now that is terrifying.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.158
I could never do that.

11:09.241 --> 11:12.871
Yeah.
Well, that's 'cause you could
never stand still long enough.

11:16.373 --> 11:19.586
It's 24 hours in a plane.
That's all.

11:19.669 --> 11:23.297
Come on, it's not like
it's the other
side of the world.

11:26.175 --> 11:31.348
So, what do you want to do
on our last night in
the northern hemisphere?

11:31.431 --> 11:35.477
Well,
actually, Archie's invited us
up to the Big House tonight.

11:36.811 --> 11:37.896
Oh.

11:39.521 --> 11:41.441
We don't have to go.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.485
Of course we have to go.

11:51.575 --> 11:55.747
So one near-birth and
one near-crash later,
here I am.

11:55.830 --> 11:58.666
-And the black cab?
-Belongs to Sean.

11:58.749 --> 12:03.796
-Who is?
-My helpful and very
heroic taxi driver.

12:03.879 --> 12:06.925
Right. So you're
here on your own, then?

12:08.968 --> 12:12.180
Well, you know me,
Arch, always travel light.

12:19.771 --> 12:21.522
What do you think?

12:23.733 --> 12:25.652
Tastes cracking to me.

12:34.159 --> 12:37.955
-It's an expensive one, then?
-Chateau la Touche, '64.

12:38.038 --> 12:41.000
I'm sure a man in
your line of business
will appreciate its calibre,

12:41.083 --> 12:44.628
the bouquet, the subtle
influence of strawberries.

12:47.089 --> 12:49.676
Aye, pretty good.
How about a refill?

12:50.634 --> 12:51.969
Of course.

12:55.807 --> 12:58.809
So, what firm do you work for?

12:58.892 --> 13:00.770
Well, it's just me
and my dad really.

13:00.854 --> 13:03.355
-A family business? Lucrative?
-Yeah.

13:03.439 --> 13:07.319
Well,
it puts food on the table
and clothes on the wee 'uns.

13:07.402 --> 13:08.944
Wee 'uns?

13:09.028 --> 13:11.196
Bairns. Kids.

13:13.783 --> 13:16.243
-Children?
-Aye, three.

13:16.327 --> 13:19.831
I live with them and
their mother in Glasgow.

13:19.914 --> 13:22.625
-And Lizzie knows about this?
-Well, sure.

13:22.708 --> 13:25.712
I told her all about
them on the way up here.

13:25.795 --> 13:28.297
So who do I speak
to about my money?

13:28.380 --> 13:31.676
-Your what?
-Aye, it's 173 quid.

13:31.760 --> 13:35.347
But seeing as you're doing me
bed and breakfast, we'll
call it 150 for cash, eh?

13:35.430 --> 13:38.641
So, your true
colours are revealed.

13:38.724 --> 13:40.434
Well,
I'm sorry to have to tell you

13:40.517 --> 13:43.271
that the gravy
train to Glenbogle
has just been derailed!

13:43.355 --> 13:47.024
(CLEARS THROAT)
I've not got any cash,
but I can do you a cheque.

13:47.107 --> 13:49.861
Pay the bounder off, Archie!
Don't want his
kind around here.

13:49.944 --> 13:54.032
Father,
Sean is Lizzie's taxi driver.
He drove her up from Glasgow.

13:54.115 --> 13:57.910
Taxi driver? From Glasgow?

13:59.788 --> 14:03.123
Well, you won't be
needing this for a start,
will you?

14:09.338 --> 14:11.131
(INSECTS BUZZING)

14:18.890 --> 14:23.102
Listen, I'll tell you what,
we'll have a password, okay?

14:23.185 --> 14:28.357
Either of us'll say,
I don't know, Rotorua mud?

14:28.440 --> 14:32.278
-Kiwi fruit.
-Okay. Kiwi fruit it is, then.

14:32.361 --> 14:34.697
"Kiwi fruit" and off we shoot.

14:39.368 --> 14:43.956
-Hello, stranger!
-Lizzie! Look at you!

14:44.039 --> 14:46.959
-This is Fergal.
-I've heard all about you.

14:47.042 --> 14:49.796
-All good, I hope.
-Highly recommended.

14:49.878 --> 14:52.673
-This is Lizzie,
Archie's sister.
-Big sister.

14:52.756 --> 14:54.384
Very big sister.

14:55.968 --> 14:58.637
I mean, if that cabbie isn't
the father, who is?

14:58.721 --> 15:00.724
We'll talk about it later,
darling.

15:01.641 --> 15:03.309
LEXIE: Speech!

15:06.438 --> 15:08.314
We were trying to
think of something

15:08.397 --> 15:10.316
to give Fergal to
thank him for all
his hard work

15:10.399 --> 15:14.320
-in helping to turn
the estate around.
-Apart from you-know-who.

15:14.403 --> 15:16.572
And we came up with these.

15:19.992 --> 15:23.288
A compass, so you won't
get lost on your travels.

15:24.831 --> 15:27.666
A stopwatch,
so you'll always be on time.

15:29.252 --> 15:31.171
And this.

15:31.254 --> 15:34.006
So you can open
a bottle of beer

15:34.089 --> 15:37.885
while taking stones
out of a horse's hoof
at the same time.

15:39.845 --> 15:43.058
-Thank you, Archie.
-No, thank you.
Thanks for everything.

15:43.141 --> 15:44.767
(ALL CHEERING)

15:55.737 --> 15:56.904
No!

15:59.449 --> 16:01.284
You can guard yourself.

16:03.827 --> 16:05.956
So, there you are.

16:06.039 --> 16:10.251
-I gather your young man
is not able to join us?
-That's right.

16:10.334 --> 16:14.046
I think we're entitled to meet
our prospective son-in-law at
some stage in the proceedings.

16:14.129 --> 16:16.548
Hector, darling,
perhaps we can
talk about this later?

16:16.632 --> 16:18.718
Any sign of wedding bells
on the horizon

16:18.802 --> 16:20.594
as an accompaniment to
a patter of tiny feet?

16:20.678 --> 16:23.181
-I don't think so.
-Well, call me
old-fashioned if you like,

16:23.265 --> 16:24.891
but I believe a child
should have two parents,

16:24.975 --> 16:27.226
preferably of opposite gender,
and ideally married.

16:27.309 --> 16:30.730
-He is married.
-I should hope... He's what?

16:30.814 --> 16:34.817
We met in France
at a trade fair.
One thing led to another.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.903
I think we can all
see what it led to.

16:36.987 --> 16:41.366
Up until two weeks ago,
I thought everything
was going to be okay.

16:41.449 --> 16:43.243
But now he's gone
back to his wife.

16:43.326 --> 16:44.868
Well, why didn't you
tell us before?

16:44.952 --> 16:46.287
Because I knew
how you'd react.

16:46.370 --> 16:48.039
What do you expect,
a pat on the back?

16:48.123 --> 16:49.873
Lizzie, darling,
don't upset yourself.

16:49.957 --> 16:52.793
-Hector, stop this at once!
-You are
utterly irresponsible.

16:52.876 --> 16:54.796
Always have been.

16:54.879 --> 16:56.714
Getting yourself in this mess
without a thought of
the effect on the family.

16:56.797 --> 16:59.759
That's all you
care about, isn't it?
Who the father is?

16:59.843 --> 17:02.886
Whether I'm polluting
the great MacDonald gene pool?

17:02.970 --> 17:05.973
It's me that's having the baby
and if
the father's not around,

17:06.057 --> 17:10.519
well, I've rather got
used to that state of affairs
over the past 30 years!

17:10.603 --> 17:12.896
What do you mean?
How dare you speak
like that to your father?

17:12.981 --> 17:14.940
-Some father.
-What?

17:15.023 --> 17:18.486
-Come on, Sean.
-Lizzie...
I shall speak to you later.

17:20.613 --> 17:22.323
-Kiwi fruit.
-Kiwi fruit.

17:28.913 --> 17:34.251
-I am so sorry you
should have seen us like this.
-Don't worry. Goodbye, Molly.

17:41.843 --> 17:44.845
Are you sure you
won't stay for round two?

17:44.927 --> 17:47.223
I've got a busy day tomorrow.

17:49.099 --> 17:51.226
I got you this.

17:52.603 --> 17:54.356
A pine cone?

17:54.439 --> 17:56.607
It's from the big fir
up on the hill.

17:56.690 --> 17:59.234
I was thinking
about replanting
some of the ground spoor

17:59.319 --> 18:02.696
and putting it back
to the way it was.

18:02.780 --> 18:05.909
That's a very lovely idea.

18:05.992 --> 18:09.410
Well, I seem to remember
it was your very lovely idea.

18:11.539 --> 18:16.794
-Right. See you around, Arch.
-Have a good trip.

18:23.677 --> 18:26.971
Well... Goodbye.

18:33.102 --> 18:35.480
Thanks for everything,
Katrina.

18:39.441 --> 18:41.069
Goodbye, Archie.

18:55.916 --> 18:57.793
Where do you think you're
going to, young lady?

18:57.876 --> 18:59.838
Sean's taking me
back to Glasgow.

18:59.921 --> 19:02.756
I think I might be a wee bit
over the limit, you know.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.717
Kilwillie castle, then.

19:04.800 --> 19:08.637
You're going to
Kilwillie's castle?
That is treachery!

19:08.721 --> 19:10.472
I'm sure he'll
be more welcoming.

19:10.556 --> 19:12.267
Ha!

19:12.350 --> 19:17.647
How sharper than
a serpent's tooth it is,
to have a thankless child.

19:17.731 --> 19:22.735
Hector, if you go on like
this, I shall never,
ever speak to you again.

19:22.818 --> 19:24.446
Come on, Lizzie!

19:27.281 --> 19:29.326
Don't waste your breath, Mum,

19:29.409 --> 19:33.412
he obviously doesn't
want anything to do
with his grandchild.

19:33.495 --> 19:36.416
Given my shortcomings
as a father,

19:36.499 --> 19:39.460
I should imagine that
would be a profound
relief to you.

19:39.543 --> 19:42.964
Lizzie, there's a warm bed
waiting for you upstairs.

19:45.424 --> 19:47.677
She's impossible, eh, Archie?

20:17.666 --> 20:19.959
I know what
you're going to say.

20:22.336 --> 20:24.214
You know what he's like.

20:24.297 --> 20:27.466
Snobbish,
reactionary, pigheaded!

20:27.549 --> 20:31.804
I'm 32 years old and
he can still wind me
up like nobody else.

20:33.597 --> 20:36.643
-He has his good points.
-Such as?

20:36.726 --> 20:40.020
-He's very loyal.
-Well, not to me, he's not!

20:40.104 --> 20:42.649
Besides, I want more
than that from my father.

20:42.732 --> 20:45.484
Loyalty is something
you get from a dog.

21:02.501 --> 21:04.712
Et tu, Monty?

21:13.971 --> 21:16.682
I don't know what
I expected of him.

21:16.765 --> 21:20.269
Though unconditional love
wouldn't have
been a bad start.

21:20.352 --> 21:23.857
I think you're going to have
to lower your sights. This is
Father we're talking about.

21:23.940 --> 21:25.150
Right.

21:25.733 --> 21:27.610
He'll be fine.

21:27.693 --> 21:31.906
He just takes
a little longer to get there
than the rest of us.

21:31.989 --> 21:34.241
In the meantime, you have me.

21:37.078 --> 21:40.164
What did I do to deserve
you as a little brother?

21:43.084 --> 21:45.836
You could have done
without me tonight,
couldn't you?

21:45.920 --> 21:47.380
Don't be silly.

21:49.506 --> 21:52.426
So, how do you feel
about her going away?

21:54.429 --> 21:56.180
It's her decision.

21:58.349 --> 22:00.560
That's not what I asked you.

22:02.353 --> 22:04.480
Besides, it's too late now.

22:05.273 --> 22:07.150
I've lost her, Lizzie.

22:46.940 --> 22:49.942
I gather Kilwillie's
tree is simply enormous.

22:50.025 --> 22:52.862
-What's that?
-Don't bait your father, dear.

22:52.946 --> 22:57.741
He may be an insufferable
dinosaur, but there's no need
to stoop to his level.

22:57.825 --> 22:59.869
It's like teasing a child.

22:59.953 --> 23:01.745
Pass Lexie's burnt toast,
would you, dear?

23:01.829 --> 23:04.874
Do you know I had
all three of my
children in this house,

23:04.958 --> 23:09.044
and Hector managed somehow
not to be here
each and every time?

23:09.128 --> 23:13.008
I couldn't bear
to see you suffer,
all that thrashing about.

23:13.091 --> 23:16.176
He was still in the reserves,
of course,
when Jamie was born.

23:16.260 --> 23:18.430
-Posted overseas.
-Cheltenham.

23:18.513 --> 23:21.015
And then when you,
Lizzie, came along,

23:21.098 --> 23:24.269
he and Kilwillie
went off to
the Royal Highland Show.

23:24.352 --> 23:30.442
Came back three days later,
still roaring drunk, with some
kind of combine harvester.

23:30.525 --> 23:33.861
Massey Ferguson 340,
still in
perfect working order.

23:33.944 --> 23:37.573
-I didn't think we
did combine harvesting.
-We don't.

23:37.656 --> 23:40.784
And then with Archie,
I think we did manage
to keep him home that time.

23:40.869 --> 23:43.621
Locked all the doors,
battened down the hatches.

23:43.704 --> 23:48.335
And then we
found a rope ladder
hanging down from the tower.

23:48.418 --> 23:52.546
Eventually got
a phone call two days later
from a B&amp;B in...

23:52.630 --> 23:55.091
Oh, where was it again?
Stromness.

23:55.175 --> 23:58.135
-Ullapool,
actually, old darling.
-I'm not speaking to you.

23:59.304 --> 24:01.430
Strathspey Gazette. Ah.

24:01.513 --> 24:03.432
You made the front page.

24:05.727 --> 24:09.605
Now then, where are we...
What's this?

24:09.688 --> 24:13.734
It's all about bally trees.
Nothing about your visitors'
centre at all, Archie.

24:13.817 --> 24:15.861
And they spelt my name wrong!

24:15.945 --> 24:18.073
And they say
there's no such thing
as bad publicity.

24:18.156 --> 24:20.741
Hector, the tree...
Sorry, breakfast.

24:22.368 --> 24:24.621
What is it, boy? Spit it out!

24:24.704 --> 24:27.706
Somebody's chopped
the top of your tree off.

24:34.004 --> 24:35.131
Father.

24:36.007 --> 24:37.383
(SNICKERING)

24:39.260 --> 24:42.180
-Unspeakable bounder!
-You do not need the shotgun.

24:42.264 --> 24:43.681
Come on,
Golly, all hands on deck.

24:43.764 --> 24:46.016
-What's happened?
-Sabotage!

24:54.234 --> 24:58.195
Oh, yes, I'm very
confident of victory.
Wouldn't you agree, William?

24:58.279 --> 24:59.698
Yes, sir.

25:01.782 --> 25:06.079
There she is.
My Titan. My Colossus.

25:17.716 --> 25:19.842
What have they done to you?

25:27.016 --> 25:29.853
Now cracks a noble heart.

25:33.063 --> 25:36.401
And vengeance shall be mine!

25:42.657 --> 25:46.243
-Please don't tell me
you've packed the coffee.
-Hello.

25:51.624 --> 25:54.127
I want to ask you
to be godmother.

25:55.920 --> 25:59.132
-Of course.
-Look after the moral
welfare of the child

25:59.215 --> 26:01.592
if I'm run over by a bus,

26:01.675 --> 26:04.804
in the absence of any suitable
paternal role models.

26:04.888 --> 26:08.807
Your dad'll come round.
He's just worried about you.

26:08.891 --> 26:11.436
About you bringing up
a child on your own.

26:11.519 --> 26:14.063
Oh, yeah,
and a lot he'd know about it,
wouldn't he?

26:14.146 --> 26:16.816
Pack 'em off to boarding
school as soon as
they're out of nappies,

26:16.900 --> 26:20.527
that's his way of
dealing with children.

26:20.611 --> 26:23.281
I left home when I was seven,
do you know that?

26:23.365 --> 26:25.491
You keep coming back,
though, don't you?

26:25.574 --> 26:29.913
Summer holidays,
Easter, Christmas,
every chance I could get.

26:29.996 --> 26:31.997
A sucker for punishment.

26:33.749 --> 26:36.169
Now it's your
turn to leave home.

26:38.254 --> 26:40.506
Had to get out
before I hit 30.

26:40.589 --> 26:44.593
He really must have
swept you off your feet.
Lucky girl!

26:44.677 --> 26:46.805
It's all happened so fast.

26:49.099 --> 26:51.183
-Do you love him?
-Fergal?

26:54.104 --> 26:56.522
He's bright. He's funny.

26:57.815 --> 27:00.902
-He's got tons of energy.
-But?

27:03.445 --> 27:06.408
He's rootless.

27:06.491 --> 27:09.577
-He doesn't belong anywhere.
-And you do.

27:10.452 --> 27:11.871
Yes, I do.

27:13.455 --> 27:15.624
You can always come back.

27:15.708 --> 27:18.336
Summer holidays,
Easter and Christmas?

27:21.171 --> 27:24.634
Stop me if I'm being
completely dense here,

27:24.718 --> 27:28.470
but this doesn't have anything
to do with Archie, does it?

27:32.808 --> 27:34.602
I just don't know
how it happened.

27:34.686 --> 27:36.563
Desertion was a court-martial
offence in my day.

27:36.646 --> 27:38.522
What's the diagnosis?

27:38.606 --> 27:42.319
Someone has been up there
with climbing spikes on.
Marks all over the tree.

27:42.402 --> 27:45.029
Duncan, Golly, saddle up.
We're going over the border.

27:45.112 --> 27:48.325
Ah, ah, ah! Do you not think
there are more
important things to consider?

27:48.408 --> 27:51.660
Like your daughter?
The imminent arrival
of your grandchild?

27:51.744 --> 27:55.123
There's plenty of time
for that later! This is war!

27:58.167 --> 28:00.545
I know you're trying to
be a good sister, Lizzie,

28:00.629 --> 28:03.797
but Archie's had months
to say
something and he hasn't.

28:03.881 --> 28:08.218
-I mean, if he
really cared about me...
-He's mad about you.

28:08.302 --> 28:10.639
He told me as much last night.

28:10.722 --> 28:15.100
He doesn't want you to go.
I don't want you to go.

28:15.184 --> 28:18.480
And I think,
in your heart of hearts,
you don't want to go.

28:18.563 --> 28:20.314
That's not true!

28:20.397 --> 28:22.441
Oh, so you'd rather
ride off into the sunset
with Fergal, would you?

28:22.524 --> 28:25.819
-Thousands of miles from home?
-Yes, I would.

28:27.112 --> 28:30.367
And you know why?
Because he asked me to.

28:31.659 --> 28:34.913
He loves me and he
wants me to go with him.

28:34.996 --> 28:39.959
And pathetic as that sounds,
that makes me feel good.

28:40.042 --> 28:44.046
I'm not saying I've never
had feelings for Archie.
I have.

28:45.881 --> 28:48.051
But what am I supposed to do
if he won't talk to me?

28:48.134 --> 28:51.303
-Oh, God.
-Lizzie, are you okay?

28:53.974 --> 28:56.725
I think the dress
rehearsals are over.

29:01.397 --> 29:03.399
Oh. Go on, man, hit it.

29:03.482 --> 29:06.570
Lex, I've got to go.
It's my dad's turn
with the cab today.

29:06.653 --> 29:09.196
-Well, I can't do it, can I?
-And why not?

29:10.155 --> 29:12.200
'Cause shanty's a man's game.

29:12.284 --> 29:14.410
Well, I wish you'd blow
the final whistle, then.

(CAR HORN HONKING)

29:18.290 --> 29:21.959
Oh, looks like we're
into extra time! Golly!

29:32.636 --> 29:35.515
-Macdonald!
-Kilwillie!

29:39.810 --> 29:44.356
So the two opposing
camps faced each other
across the barren moor.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.442
Blood lust was stirring.

29:46.526 --> 29:50.863
You always were a devious
little toerag, but I never
thought you'd stoop to that!

29:50.946 --> 29:53.617
-You're the scoundrel.
-En garde!

29:53.700 --> 29:55.618
En garde yourself.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.332
A hit! A very palpable hit!

30:00.415 --> 30:02.917
-Nonsense,
a scratch, a mere scratch.
-Come on, that is enough.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.502
Ow! Stop it.

30:05.712 --> 30:08.797
-Oh, I say! You cheat!
-Baldy!

30:08.881 --> 30:11.718
-Stick insect!
-That is it!

30:11.801 --> 30:13.802
Consider our friendship over!

30:13.886 --> 30:17.724
I'm sure my bank manager
will be delighted to hear it!

30:18.433 --> 30:20.100
Come on, Father.

30:29.444 --> 30:34.491
McCRORY: The blood of the
MacDonalds once more spilt on
the heather of Glenbogle.

30:34.574 --> 30:37.409
Okay, we need a midwife,
clean sheets
and lots of hot water.

30:37.493 --> 30:39.912
-Can you make
it up the stairs?
-Absolutely not!

30:39.995 --> 30:42.415
Right, come on.

30:42.499 --> 30:44.667
I'm not going to give
birth on a billiard table!

30:44.750 --> 30:47.963
Then it'd better be the l
ibrary. Come on. Stay calm.
That's good, darling.

30:48.046 --> 30:50.714
Come on, come on, stay calm.

30:53.969 --> 30:56.845
The arrogance!
The sheer vanity of the man!

30:56.929 --> 30:58.556
Yes, sir.

30:58.640 --> 31:01.725
You do realise I have
more than 8,000 of these.

31:03.143 --> 31:04.896
How big is mine again?

31:08.857 --> 31:12.404
210 feet, 8 inches,
from base to tip, sir.

31:12.487 --> 31:17.617
Oh, well, we're clear
of the field. So far.

31:17.701 --> 31:22.622
'Cause there's no
two ways about it,
I simply must win!

31:22.706 --> 31:24.958
Bit below the belt that,
I thought.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.626
Well, you were both
behaving rather foolishly.

31:27.710 --> 31:29.129
I suppose so.

31:31.630 --> 31:34.634
I did my best with the estate,
you know.

31:34.718 --> 31:37.344
Not much talent
for business, though.

31:37.428 --> 31:40.849
Not much talent
for anything, really.
Not much of a father, either.

31:40.932 --> 31:43.017
Come on, that's not true.

31:43.100 --> 31:46.479
Cut me to the quick, you know,
when young Lizzie said that.

31:46.563 --> 31:51.525
I thought fatherhood was the
one thing I haven't made
a complete bish of.

31:51.609 --> 31:54.571
You've turned out all right,
though, haven't you?

31:54.654 --> 31:57.990
I don't have any complaints.

31:58.073 --> 32:02.953
I barely knew my own father.
Nanny used to look
after all the children.

32:03.037 --> 32:06.166
We'd come downstairs from the
nursery in our kilts,
stand to attention,

32:06.249 --> 32:08.250
speak when spoken to.

32:08.334 --> 32:10.503
I can't imagine your sister
putting up with that, eh?

32:10.587 --> 32:13.422
No. So you must've
done something right.

32:15.090 --> 32:17.427
LIZZIE: Oh, do I have
to have that old thing?

32:17.510 --> 32:19.595
Yes, darling,
it's family tradition.

32:19.678 --> 32:21.805
Oh, God, it's disgusting!

32:24.768 --> 32:28.145
The midwife won't be
here for at least an hour

32:28.228 --> 32:30.357
so we're just gonna
have to make
a start ourselves.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.149
LIZZIE: Oh!

32:32.232 --> 32:33.901
-Hot water?
-Check.

32:33.984 --> 32:35.362
-Towels?
-Check.

32:35.445 --> 32:37.154
-Rope?
-Rope?

32:38.989 --> 32:40.992
You have done this before,
haven't you?

32:41.076 --> 32:43.202
I got three of my own,
10, 8 and 4.

32:43.285 --> 32:46.665
Now just try and relax,
breathe deeply.
Remember?

32:47.707 --> 32:49.333
-Ooh.
-Right?

32:50.167 --> 32:52.294
Whatever you say, doctor.

32:55.089 --> 32:58.635
Look, she came home,
didn't she? It can't have
been easy for her.

32:58.718 --> 33:02.263
It's just not how
I imagined things
turning out for the girl.

33:02.346 --> 33:04.808
I'm sure it's not how Lizzie
would have wanted it either,

33:04.891 --> 33:07.101
but she's just got to
put up with it, hasn't she?

33:07.184 --> 33:09.895
I think the least you can do
is give her a bit
of moral support.

33:09.979 --> 33:12.023
I don't think she
wants my support.
You heard what she said.

33:12.107 --> 33:16.403
She was angry and upset.
She didn't mean it.

33:16.486 --> 33:22.324
Look, she didn't come home for
the dodgy electricity and
the leaky taps, did she?

33:22.409 --> 33:25.411
She came home to be with the
people who love her and
who'll look after her.

33:25.494 --> 33:27.830
And I'm sure
she'd want you there.

33:48.435 --> 33:50.936
What are you
doing with that, man?

33:51.020 --> 33:55.441
I'm keeping it out of
the clutches of that vandal.
It's all valuable evidence.

33:55.524 --> 33:59.070
I'd have thought 50 years
of friendship was all
the evidence you'd need.

33:59.154 --> 34:02.156
I admire your loyalty, Golly,
but you're
wasting your breath.

34:02.239 --> 34:03.991
It's an open and shut case.

34:04.074 --> 34:06.869
Hector and Archie were
at the house all night.
I can vouch for that.

34:06.952 --> 34:10.998
Duncan was where he
shouldn't have been,
at home in bed, right?

34:11.081 --> 34:13.208
And I know I didn't do it.

34:13.292 --> 34:16.963
So you tell me exactly how
you work out
Hector is responsible.

34:17.047 --> 34:20.882
-Oh, it's all mere details.
-No, no, no. Plain facts.

34:20.966 --> 34:24.596
Well,
if Hector isn't responsible,
then who the bally hell is?

34:28.181 --> 34:32.186
-How much do you
trust your new man?
-Oh, don't be ridiculous.

34:32.268 --> 34:35.523
He comes to me
highly recommended.
He's utterly trustworthy.

34:35.607 --> 34:36.899
Is he?

34:40.069 --> 34:42.155
What do you make of that?

34:45.157 --> 34:47.244
What do you make
of these, then?

34:47.327 --> 34:51.455
I'd say you owe Hector
an apology. Wouldn't you?

34:54.708 --> 34:56.335
You're doing brilliantly.

34:56.418 --> 35:00.298
-He's certainly on the move,
all right.
-I know. I can feel him.

35:00.382 --> 35:05.220
That's right, darling, let it
out, let it out. I was just
the same, a real screamer.

35:05.303 --> 35:09.139

hear me right on the far side
of the loch. Come on.

Quite right, my boy.
Carpe diem.

35:30.495 --> 35:34.081

-Just tell her
that you love her.

I say. Well done, old girl.

a MacDonald, doesn't she?

Okay,
we've only got 15 minutes.
We really have to go.

saying goodbye to Lizzie,
not now.

Just give me
two seconds, okay?

37:29.155 --> 37:32.616
-I thought we'd lost you.
-Not quite yet.

37:34.286 --> 37:37.496
Then we'd better
not stand on ceremony.

wanted to leave in

I don't know if
what she feels for me,

or what she felt,

44:20.024 --> 44:21.483
was enough.

47:10.779 --> 47:12.446
-I've got it.
-Can you manage?

47:12.529 --> 47:14.240
-Yeah.
-Excellent.

47:14.323 --> 47:16.076
Hot off the press.

47:19.078 --> 47:22.332
The result of the competition
organised by
the Woodland Trust

47:22.415 --> 47:25.334
to find the tallest tree
in Scotland is as follows.

47:25.417 --> 47:27.169
The Kilwillie tree,

47:27.253 --> 47:31.632
or what remains of it,
203 feet and 6 inches.

47:32.675 --> 47:34.219
Hurrah.

47:34.302 --> 47:37.179
The MacDonald tree, 203 feet.

47:38.097 --> 47:40.350
Inches, man, inches.

47:40.433 --> 47:42.643
203 feet precisely.

47:45.104 --> 47:48.066
-Oh, never mind, old man.
-It's only a tree.

47:50.651 --> 47:53.196
Isn't that Tubby
McIver over there?

47:53.280 --> 47:56.782
Yes. But he's
the chap who recommended...

47:57.742 --> 47:59.077
Billy the gillie.

47:59.160 --> 48:02.079
And so, with all competitors
duly taken into account,

48:02.162 --> 48:04.874
it's now my final duty
to announce a winner.

48:04.958 --> 48:09.796
A fine specimen of scottus
pinas from the estate of
Lord McIver of Kilkern.

48:09.879 --> 48:11.089
BOTH: What?

48:13.257 --> 48:16.761
I could have told you that
McIver was a complete
and utter scoundrel.

48:16.845 --> 48:18.929
Oh,
that's all very well, Hector,

48:19.013 --> 48:24.310
but what the bally Moses
am I gonna do with these?

48:24.393 --> 48:28.690
How am I supposed to market
the second tallest
tree in Scotland?

48:29.149 --> 48:30.357
Ah.

48:33.904 --> 48:38.157
Wherever you roam,
whatever path
you choose to take,

48:38.240 --> 48:44.496
this place will always be your
home, and this family will
always be your family.

48:44.580 --> 48:48.250
-And that goes for
you too, young lady.
-Thank you, Daddy.

48:48.334 --> 48:52.172
Don't suppose you can tear
yourself away from
the bright lights of London?

48:52.255 --> 48:56.967
You could always come and
visit us, Daddy. I could use
a cheap baby-sitter.

48:58.553 --> 49:01.055
-Present the quaich.
-The quaich.

49:10.065 --> 49:14.068
This silver quaich,
engraved with
the family motto...

49:14.151 --> 49:15.862
"Takes one to know one."

49:15.946 --> 49:19.573
...has been handed down
through
generations of MacDonalds.

49:19.657 --> 49:24.245
We use it again today to
bless the arrival of...

49:24.328 --> 49:26.872
Hang on, hang on,
we don't have a name
for her yet, do we?

49:26.956 --> 49:30.209
-Martha.
-Martha, my mother's name.

49:30.292 --> 49:32.253
Thank you, Lizzie.

49:32.336 --> 49:36.465
-Don't drop her, will you?
-Would I drop my
own granddaughter?

49:37.508 --> 49:39.093
(HECTOR CLEARS THROAT)

49:42.304 --> 49:43.639
Thank you, Golly.

49:46.226 --> 49:49.103
Dearest Martha,
we welcome you.

49:50.854 --> 49:54.400
Take your place on
God's good green Earth.

49:54.483 --> 49:56.485
Play your part in the...

49:57.278 --> 49:58.863
Circle of life?

49:59.698 --> 50:01.657
Very good, Lexie, yes.

50:02.825 --> 50:05.036
The circle of life.

50:05.120 --> 50:08.956
Welcome to Glenbogle,
Martha MacDonald.

50:09.039 --> 50:11.376
ALL: Martha MacDonald.

50:11.459 --> 50:13.252
Jolly good show, what.
