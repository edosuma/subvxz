00:36.383 --> 00:39.039
You do realize why you're in this car,
do you not?

00:41.179 --> 00:43.715
You've been tasked by Mr. Durant
to build a bridge.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.935
Any man can lay track.
Am I correct?

00:47.060 --> 00:49.258
Yes, ma'am.
Pretty near.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.656
Then can you explain
why you've been spending

00:51.781 --> 00:53.608
all your energy at rail's end

00:53.733 --> 00:55.055
instead of at the bridge site?

00:55.221 --> 00:57.683
That will be remedied, ma'am.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.372
Thank you.

01:03.159 --> 01:05.524
You heard what the lady said.

01:05.690 --> 01:09.445
This the part where I tell you the men
don't like taking orders from a woman.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.293
They don't have to like it.

01:11.418 --> 01:13.762
No, they don't.

01:13.887 --> 01:16.080
But if you're looking to get back
in Mr. Durant's good graces,

01:16.205 --> 01:19.205
then pissing off the man
might not be the best tact.

01:19.371 --> 01:22.124
Doesn't matter,
as long as we get this rail road built.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.588
If you're not careful, miss bell,

01:23.713 --> 01:26.141
you're going to start sounding like a man.

01:26.266 --> 01:28.506
Right.

01:47.454 --> 01:50.111
All right! Move your carcasses!

01:56.412 --> 01:58.964
Step on it!

02:01.788 --> 02:04.792
You lot, for the gorge,

02:04.958 --> 02:08.252
make room for one more.
And as for the rest of you

02:08.419 --> 02:11.152
jackanapes, I expect to be able
to walk a mile of rail

02:11.277 --> 02:13.355
by the time I get back from me lunch break.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.108
Change the numbers all you want,
that ain't the problem.

02:17.233 --> 02:18.827
56 men?

02:18.952 --> 02:20.478
23.

02:20.603 --> 02:24.461
And we've got another 46 coming in.
Another...

02:43.538 --> 02:46.542
That's got to be Fleming.
The sentry?

02:46.708 --> 02:49.598
You need to do something.

03:12.155 --> 03:14.779
Bring me the long rifle.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.531
There's too many!
They got the high ground.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.001
If you keep them occupied,

03:18.126 --> 03:19.867
we can loop back and try and outflank 'em.

03:20.130 --> 03:22.620
Damn it, I said bring me
the long rifle right now!

03:29.355 --> 03:31.170
Get back.

04:03.173 --> 04:04.082
He shot Fleming!

05:14.856 --> 05:16.607
{pub}Look at me.

05:16.732 --> 05:18.443
Look at me.
Look at me.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.644
Look at me.

05:20.769 --> 05:23.365
I see you.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.392
Damn, woman.

05:55.804 --> 05:59.600
What's so funny?

05:59.725 --> 06:02.136
Never thought I'd be glad

06:02.261 --> 06:04.605
Mr. Toole made foreman.

06:04.730 --> 06:08.192
Out early, home late.

06:08.317 --> 06:11.246
Don't speak his name.

06:11.737 --> 06:13.998
You know the rules.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.001
Right.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.786
'Cause you live by rules.

06:27.419 --> 06:31.474
I want you to feel something.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.351
Damn, girl.

06:34.476 --> 06:36.522
Give a man a minute to raise his spirit.

06:46.005 --> 06:48.116
You feel that?

06:50.492 --> 06:53.455
That little bump?

06:53.621 --> 06:56.166
You and me made that.

07:03.822 --> 07:06.218
How you know?

07:06.491 --> 07:09.844
Because I know.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.698
Say something.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.172
Elam Ferguson, you look me in the eyes

07:41.338 --> 07:42.730
and you tell me what you're thinkin'.

08:03.098 --> 08:06.278
Don't you leave here
without saying something.

08:09.948 --> 08:12.890
I can't.

08:17.296 --> 08:18.789
See, I'm ask... asking you

08:18.914 --> 08:20.991
to look... look inside your heart.

08:21.116 --> 08:22.609
Inside your heart.

08:22.734 --> 08:25.496
Sorry, Reverend.
I'm afraid it's empty.

08:25.621 --> 08:28.572
Same as my wallet.

08:33.044 --> 08:35.046
Hey!

08:36.914 --> 08:38.842
All right now?

08:38.967 --> 08:40.918
Reverend.
Cullen!

08:41.227 --> 08:42.263
Could you...

08:42.388 --> 08:44.315
Could you spot a fellow traveler a drink?

08:44.589 --> 08:46.024
Rye, barkeep.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.517
- Be right with you.
- Carl.

08:51.392 --> 08:54.525
Just the one.
You've got to read over a man today.

08:54.650 --> 08:57.995
Oh, you have to ask
that harlot who threw me out.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.539
You mean your daughter?

08:59.705 --> 09:00.864
Yeah.

09:00.989 --> 09:02.983
That sinning bitch

09:03.108 --> 09:04.752
stole my church.

09:04.877 --> 09:10.114
Yes, she's...
Your conduit to the Lord now.

09:14.336 --> 09:18.165
You mind me asking
where you been bedding down?

09:18.290 --> 09:20.384
I've been, uh,

09:20.509 --> 09:22.686
been sleeping in the cemetery.

09:22.811 --> 09:25.723
It's near freezing at night.
There's no cover.

09:25.848 --> 09:28.842
Yeah, I find the dead a comfort.

09:30.602 --> 09:33.156
What the hell?

09:33.322 --> 09:35.325
You can bunk with me
until you get yourself settled.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.568
Go on. Set him up.

09:37.693 --> 09:41.165
Carl, set them... set them up.

09:56.678 --> 09:58.389
What in the hell's going on?

09:58.514 --> 10:00.391
Why aren't y'all men at work?

10:00.516 --> 10:03.353
Turn around and get back on...

10:05.721 --> 10:07.983
Mr. Toole.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.404
You mind telling me
why these men ain't at work?

10:12.644 --> 10:14.938
With all due respect,

10:15.063 --> 10:16.991
we lost a man out there.

10:17.157 --> 10:19.777
- A mate.
- That's right!

10:19.902 --> 10:21.955
Then you finish your day's work.

10:22.187 --> 10:25.375
Then you come back in
and drink to his memory.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.669
We parlayed.
We all agree.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.088
It's not safe.

10:30.254 --> 10:31.705
It's about to get unsafe around here

10:31.830 --> 10:34.708
if you don't get your ass back to work.

10:34.833 --> 10:37.012
I am afraid you'll just have to shoot us.

10:37.419 --> 10:39.347
That's right!

10:53.751 --> 10:55.978
{pub}If we route South,

10:56.103 --> 10:58.647
then we can bridge the river here...

10:58.772 --> 11:01.984
And avoid the entire issue of Sacred Land.

11:02.109 --> 11:02.909
Yes.

11:04.185 --> 11:05.771
At considerable expense.

11:05.896 --> 11:07.790
Spend a few more pennies now

11:07.915 --> 11:09.458
and keep your work force, Thomas.

11:09.583 --> 11:10.709
Pennies.

11:10.834 --> 11:12.588
We can't run from the Sioux.

11:12.754 --> 11:14.716
If it ain't this gorge,
it'll be the next one.

11:14.882 --> 11:18.011
- The men are afraid to work.
- Then we should find ones who ain't.

11:18.241 --> 11:21.098
They believe that if the Sioux
won't kill them, perhaps you will.

11:21.264 --> 11:22.349
Bullshit.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.810
Of course. When logic isn't on
your side, resort to the profane.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.959
All right, I'll give you facts.

11:27.084 --> 11:28.939
Here, here, here.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.230
May not be sacred,
but it's all Sioux territory.

11:31.355 --> 11:33.940
We've already established what's
on this side of the gorge!

11:34.568 --> 11:35.901
For once, let's be smart.

11:36.026 --> 11:38.131
Reroute and show the men that we can
steer them out of harm's way.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.367
The Indians' home's at stake, young lady.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.940
They'll fight us all
the way to the Rockies.

11:41.941 --> 11:44.630
- If that's true, then we're lost!
- We turn tail first sign of trouble,

11:44.631 --> 11:45.822
yes, we are.
You don't...

11:45.936 --> 11:46.996
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:47.121 --> 11:49.709
What is your plan, Mr. Bohannon?

11:49.875 --> 11:51.617
Fight 'em here, fight 'em now.

11:51.742 --> 11:53.869
With what? That rabble?

11:53.994 --> 11:54.881
Them's the ones we got.

11:55.112 --> 11:56.589
They...

11:56.714 --> 12:00.176
They won't even work for you.

12:00.301 --> 12:02.962
You let me worry about that.

12:03.087 --> 12:05.517
Just don't reroute this rail road.

12:14.515 --> 12:17.893
Let me.

12:18.018 --> 12:20.729
Thank you.

12:20.854 --> 12:24.182
Your husband know about
what you told me earlier?

12:24.307 --> 12:25.851
No.

12:25.976 --> 12:28.454
Nobody knows but you and me.

12:28.579 --> 12:30.823
Good.

12:30.948 --> 12:34.710
I've spent my whole
life trying to get free.

12:34.835 --> 12:37.924
Then here come a woman...
A white woman...

12:38.155 --> 12:40.968
A married woman, spinning my head

12:41.134 --> 12:43.535
saying she's got my baby.

12:43.660 --> 12:46.872
I couldn't think of nothin' to do but run.

12:46.997 --> 12:49.842
Then it set with me.

12:49.967 --> 12:51.543
And?

12:51.668 --> 12:54.563
Any harm come to you,
I go weak in the head.

12:54.688 --> 12:56.068
You are weak in the head.

12:56.306 --> 12:57.516
All the gold eagles in the world

12:57.641 --> 12:59.268
ain't worth a pinch of coon shit

12:59.393 --> 13:03.199
if you can't use it to help
the folk that you care about.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.774
Elam...

13:05.899 --> 13:08.894
What are you saying?

13:09.019 --> 13:11.291
You saying you care about me?

13:12.990 --> 13:15.742
I love you.

13:16.994 --> 13:19.091
I love you, woman.

13:33.376 --> 13:37.025
I need you to take these double eagles

13:37.191 --> 13:39.736
and get yourself taken care of.

13:41.268 --> 13:43.073
Taken care of.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.947
You can't have no black baby.

13:45.072 --> 13:47.286
Your husband will kill
it or you or both of you.

13:47.557 --> 13:49.785
Elam, I used to be a whore.
If I want to get rid of this child,

13:49.910 --> 13:52.538
I got my ways.

13:52.663 --> 13:56.532
And you don't need to fear
for your freedom on my account.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.352
We're all in the same position...

16:20.477 --> 16:23.483
The Sioux don't look
at any of us any different.

16:23.730 --> 16:25.557
They just aim to kill.

16:25.682 --> 16:28.694
That doesn't explain why you're
interrupting a private wake.

16:28.819 --> 16:31.447

the end of the rail

16:31.572 --> 16:33.076

we'll go out early and...

Give 'em guns?

16:38.745 --> 16:41.240
Patrol for Sioux.

16:41.365 --> 16:44.293
Mr. Durant ain't going
to arm no ex-slaves

We aren't working, neither.
Not until you protect us.

18:33.401 --> 18:35.802
Yes, ma'am.

18:45.947 --> 18:49.659
What are they demanding?

18:49.784 --> 18:51.589
They want protection.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.571
Well, we can't guarantee their safety

18:53.696 --> 18:55.248
against the Sioux.
It's a hazard of the job.

18:55.373 --> 18:57.750
More beans.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.535
And the freedmen?

18:59.660 --> 19:01.808
They want to be armed.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.540
Give rifles to an army of ex-slaves?

19:04.665 --> 19:06.840
No, no.
I won't allow it.

19:06.965 --> 19:09.607
- That's what I told them.
- This is why we change the route.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.064
Avoid sacred land.

19:11.189 --> 19:12.652
Win the men back

19:12.818 --> 19:14.150
by taking them out of harm's way.

19:14.275 --> 19:16.781
You do that, you'll lose this rail road.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.866
At least get the freedmen back out there.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.606
They'll do what we tell them to do.

19:20.731 --> 19:22.537
All evidence to the contrary.

19:22.703 --> 19:25.411
Those Negroes...

19:25.536 --> 19:27.792
Are the property of this rail road,

19:27.958 --> 19:29.032
Mr. Bohannon.

19:29.157 --> 19:30.670
Property?

19:30.836 --> 19:33.736
Yes.
Most of the freedmen are criminals

19:33.861 --> 19:35.842
that we bought their sentences

19:36.008 --> 19:38.511
from the states where
they were serving time.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.293
Bought them, bought me,
it's all beside the point.

19:40.294 --> 19:41.757
They do not make demands.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.263
I told you when you hired me,
this was a war.

19:44.388 --> 19:49.268
Yes. And I expected you
to have a battle plan.

19:49.393 --> 19:50.770
Well?!

19:50.895 --> 19:53.523
Let me be clear.

19:53.648 --> 19:55.475
I can't do anything

19:55.600 --> 19:57.655
without your complete authority.

20:02.607 --> 20:05.497
This is yours to deal with.

20:05.663 --> 20:09.626
Then, yeah.
I've got a plan.

20:13.951 --> 20:17.704
Hear you're holding
that rail road hostage, huh?

20:19.173 --> 20:22.635
He'll use you as a sacrificial
lamb for them Injuns.

20:22.760 --> 20:24.887
You worry about your people.

20:25.012 --> 20:28.091
And I'm going to worry about mine.

20:28.216 --> 20:32.478
Boys get themself killed playing with guns.

20:32.603 --> 20:36.015
They ain't never going to see us as equals

20:36.140 --> 20:38.279
till we holding the weapons they got.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.490
Ohh.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.909
I suppose everybody looks the same

20:47.034 --> 20:48.861
once the maggots get to 'em.

20:48.986 --> 20:51.938
Mm-hmm.

21:27.525 --> 21:30.870
You'd be a vision even if your whole body

21:30.995 --> 21:33.163
were covered in them things.

21:34.532 --> 21:37.693
Your beauty could never
be hidden from my eyes.

21:37.818 --> 21:40.663
Are you drunk, Mr. Toole?

21:40.788 --> 21:42.215
How did you know?

21:42.340 --> 21:48.838
You always wax poetic
when you got a noseful.

21:48.963 --> 21:50.226
Chitterlings again?

21:50.631 --> 21:52.270
Yeah.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.093
I had a hanking for them.

21:54.218 --> 21:56.095
Just can't seem to get enough.

21:56.220 --> 21:58.064
They're fattening you up a bit.

21:58.189 --> 22:01.050
I like me a woman with a bit of girth.

22:01.175 --> 22:05.905
Oh, it's... it's strange
me wanting to eat so much

22:06.030 --> 22:08.557
with me being so sick
in the mornings of late.

22:08.682 --> 22:10.943
I'm sure it'll pass.

22:11.068 --> 22:13.123
Give us a kiss, woman.

22:13.988 --> 22:16.156
Mmm.

22:17.241 --> 22:21.170
Mr. Toole...

22:21.295 --> 22:23.176
I'm with child.

22:28.302 --> 22:30.141
And it ain't yours.

22:33.707 --> 22:36.219
I can't...

22:36.344 --> 22:38.420
I can't lie to you.

22:38.545 --> 22:42.775
You've been one of the most
halfway decent men I ever known,

22:42.900 --> 22:48.104
but this... this child
belongs to another.

23:01.535 --> 23:03.549
Does this mean you're leaving me?

23:21.525 --> 23:24.757
Seems you've got your work
cut out for you, boss man.

23:25.028 --> 23:27.770
It ain't nothing I can't handle.

23:27.895 --> 23:31.857
Can you send a message
to the council bluffs office?

23:31.982 --> 23:35.661
"Labor negotiations stalled." Stop.

23:35.786 --> 23:39.165
"Work halted." Stop.

23:39.290 --> 23:42.201
"Send 200 replacement workers

23:42.326 --> 23:44.320
on the next available train."

23:44.445 --> 23:46.956
Stop.
Got that?

23:47.081 --> 23:48.040
All right.

23:48.165 --> 23:50.137
There's gonna be bloodshed.

23:50.303 --> 23:51.260
What you care?

23:51.385 --> 23:53.929
You ain't no Freedman.

23:54.054 --> 23:56.393
You sure as hell ain't Irish or German.

23:56.559 --> 23:59.480
I ain't cleaning up after your mess.

23:59.646 --> 24:04.106
Nah. You'll just do whatever
Mr. Durant wants you to.

24:04.231 --> 24:06.570
Won't you?

24:20.481 --> 24:25.027
There is a storm brewing in town.

24:25.152 --> 24:28.381
Oh, that's... that's a labor dispute

24:28.506 --> 24:31.083
it appears to me.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.219
Oh, more blood.

24:33.344 --> 24:36.005
More bodies.

24:36.130 --> 24:38.540
More coffins.

24:38.665 --> 24:40.897
Heh heh heh.

24:41.063 --> 24:43.524
Our jobs have never
been more secure. Hmm?

24:47.903 --> 24:52.158
Can I tell you a...
A secret, Reverend?

24:57.201 --> 25:00.279
War is coming.

25:00.404 --> 25:02.584
Yet again.

25:02.750 --> 25:07.736
And not this business of
workers sitting down on the job.

25:07.861 --> 25:11.707
A real war.

25:11.832 --> 25:14.627
Ahh!

25:14.752 --> 25:17.246
Now is the time...

25:17.371 --> 25:21.508
To see things clear.

25:24.428 --> 25:29.528
We must decide...

25:29.694 --> 25:32.395
Which side we are on.

25:32.520 --> 25:35.104
Hmm?

26:04.271 --> 26:05.773
Where do you think you're going?

26:05.939 --> 26:06.762
Out of me way.

26:06.887 --> 26:08.734
I'm gonna tell you this once.

26:10.274 --> 26:13.018
You lay a hand on her,

26:13.143 --> 26:14.894
I'm gonna kill you.

26:17.314 --> 26:19.825
Oh, you can thrash me?

26:19.950 --> 26:23.112
Fine.

26:23.237 --> 26:25.455
You're not a real man.

26:30.494 --> 26:33.155
Just so we're clear.

26:33.280 --> 26:38.751
Puffed up. Big gun.
You can go to hell.

26:40.287 --> 26:43.182
What kind of man are you?

26:43.307 --> 26:45.968
Most of us would give
our life to be a father,

26:46.093 --> 26:48.971
but look at you, huh?

26:49.096 --> 26:51.576
You didn't even stay by her side before.

26:51.742 --> 26:53.809
And where are you now?

26:53.934 --> 27:00.911
In the middle of town flexing
your damn trigger finger.

27:08.198 --> 27:10.867
You're no father.

27:11.170 --> 27:14.133
You're just a coward.

27:19.009 --> 27:21.724
Good night, then, yellow belly.

27:48.424 --> 27:50.628
{pub}Reverend?

27:53.816 --> 27:57.137
You... you got any socks you want done?

28:01.538 --> 28:04.363
Why don't you go to the starlight, huh?

28:04.488 --> 28:05.788
Get us a bottle.

28:10.146 --> 28:12.757
What's a train doing here so late at night?

28:12.882 --> 28:14.476
Steel workers.

28:14.601 --> 28:17.729
Coming in to take over for
thems who won't go out.

28:17.854 --> 28:19.481
You're replacing the men?

28:19.606 --> 28:21.867
Laying rail ain't no scholarly business.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.818
If the men don't want to work,

28:23.943 --> 28:25.987
there's hundreds more where they came from.

28:26.112 --> 28:27.956
Now, you get us a bottle.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.831
Whatever's left, you keep.

29:08.077 --> 29:09.749
You enjoying your view?

29:11.274 --> 29:13.669
Matter of fact, I ain't.

29:19.006 --> 29:20.284
Let's go!

29:39.819 --> 29:42.397
The men think they stepping off that train

29:42.522 --> 29:44.065
and get jobs.

29:44.190 --> 29:45.951
If they can fight,
they might just have them.

30:26.849 --> 30:28.869
Boys are getting their ass kicked.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.700
Let's get them, boys!

31:23.122 --> 31:24.953
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

31:55.238 --> 31:58.458
You tell anybody else trying
to come out here what happened.

31:58.624 --> 31:59.650
You hear me?

32:01.661 --> 32:03.078
Get out of here!

32:03.379 --> 32:04.956
Go! Go!

32:05.081 --> 32:06.542
Go back where you came from!

32:24.466 --> 32:26.811
Let me see.

32:26.936 --> 32:29.197
What you got?

32:39.115 --> 32:41.525
We're willing to go back to work,

32:41.650 --> 32:43.961
under one condition.

32:44.086 --> 32:46.581
Maybe you don't understand.

32:46.706 --> 32:49.083
I could have another trainload
of workers here tomorrow.

32:49.208 --> 32:51.011
We understand.

32:54.047 --> 32:56.001
If the Negroes are
willing to put themselves

32:56.126 --> 32:58.893
between us and the Sioux,

32:59.018 --> 33:01.105
we're OK with them having guns.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.508
Hmm.

33:11.063 --> 33:13.481
Go get yourself some rest, Mr. Toole.

33:23.526 --> 33:26.070
Proud of yourself?

33:26.195 --> 33:28.123
Pride ain't got nothing to do with it.

33:28.248 --> 33:30.718
So that was the plan?

33:30.884 --> 33:33.244
Now everybody's supposed to
get along happy ever after?

33:33.369 --> 33:36.247
Not quite yet.

33:37.990 --> 33:39.518
Now you need to get your
people back to work.

33:40.209 --> 33:42.620
Ain't no sense having a horse

33:42.745 --> 33:44.455
unless it's broke enough
so you can ride it.

33:44.580 --> 33:47.509
Except we ain't talking about horses.

33:47.634 --> 33:48.944
We talking about men.

33:49.110 --> 33:52.630
Same principle.

33:52.755 --> 33:55.299
You work for Mr. Durant now.

33:55.424 --> 33:56.808
Same as me.

33:58.928 --> 34:02.207
That means we're the ones doing the riding.

34:30.568 --> 34:31.860
{pub}Y'all got a choice.

34:31.985 --> 34:34.481
You either get back to work...

34:34.606 --> 34:36.116
Or go back to prison.

34:36.282 --> 34:38.244
Says who?

34:39.860 --> 34:41.204
Boss man.

34:42.813 --> 34:46.043
Then we need to hear it from the boss man.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.585
You're hearing it just as good from me.

34:47.752 --> 34:50.914
I ain't hearing nothing but some noise...

34:51.039 --> 34:53.300
Coming from the boss man's flunky.

34:55.877 --> 34:56.929
Look at you.

34:58.659 --> 34:59.723
What you've become.

35:03.685 --> 35:05.929
Get your ass up, boy!

35:08.306 --> 35:10.390
Get him, son.
Get him!

35:12.693 --> 35:14.293
♪

35:25.490 --> 35:27.459
Aah!

35:33.298 --> 35:36.176
Don't know if you're black,
don't know if you're white.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.378
You're nothing.
You hear me?

35:38.503 --> 35:39.746
You're nothing.

36:03.869 --> 36:05.371
You ain't nothing.

36:05.496 --> 36:07.791
You ain't nothing.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.501
Get your ass up.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.702
Get your ass up, boy.

36:18.092 --> 36:22.129
Aah!

36:22.964 --> 36:24.600
You bit me!

36:24.766 --> 36:26.059
You bit me!

36:48.740 --> 36:51.252
You're still my nigger.

37:15.984 --> 37:17.361
Strike's over.

37:19.020 --> 37:20.530
They gave in?

37:20.696 --> 37:23.850
If the freedmen agree
to go back out, no conditions,

37:23.975 --> 37:27.036
when the men sober up,
we'll give the Negroes rifles

37:27.161 --> 37:28.455
and send everybody back out to the cut.

37:28.621 --> 37:29.689
But you said yourself

37:29.814 --> 37:31.166
we can't capitulate to their demands.

37:31.332 --> 37:33.002
Point is, we ain't.

37:33.168 --> 37:34.712
I am not arming the freedmen.

37:34.878 --> 37:36.921
You want this rail road built,
somebody's got to patrol that land.

37:37.171 --> 37:40.342
Now, you gonna let me do this or not?

37:42.176 --> 37:44.871
Well, if they want to be Cannon fodder,

37:44.996 --> 37:46.306
hmm, so be it.

37:47.357 --> 37:49.726
But we have lost two days and 5 Miles.

37:49.892 --> 37:53.212
Those men fought to
the death for their jobs.

37:53.337 --> 37:55.315
We'll make up those 5 Miles in no times.

37:55.481 --> 37:58.610
So that's it.
We move forward.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.528
At what cost?

38:00.694 --> 38:02.405
You're the one said building this rail road

38:02.530 --> 38:03.506
is the only thing that matters.

38:03.572 --> 38:05.692
Being smart and rerouting

38:05.817 --> 38:08.078
is not the same as being weak.

38:08.244 --> 38:11.030
You and me's gonna have to
agree to disagree.

38:11.155 --> 38:14.834
Yes. Because clearly it always
has to be on your terms,

38:14.959 --> 38:18.037
doesn't it?

38:18.162 --> 38:20.506
It don't work...

38:20.631 --> 38:23.550
If there's any question about that.

38:27.588 --> 38:30.141
Got yourself a real workforce now.

38:46.926 --> 38:48.177
Mrs. Toole,

38:51.748 --> 38:54.082
your husband has returned home.

39:46.676 --> 39:50.463
Reverend, you leaving me?

39:50.588 --> 39:54.017
Well, I see you've
bent the men to your will.

39:54.142 --> 39:56.227
I suppose I played a part in that.

39:56.393 --> 39:58.939
Yeah.

39:59.105 --> 40:01.525
Yeah.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.454
Is it true?

40:17.532 --> 40:20.483
I mean, do you believe
you're at war with the Sioux?

40:27.341 --> 40:29.928
Yes, sir, I do.

40:32.329 --> 40:34.516
And now you have the men to do the job.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.188
I can't stay with you.

40:42.390 --> 40:44.526
I respect that.

40:57.412 --> 40:58.981
Rifle in your left hand,
cartridge in your right.

40:58.982 --> 41:00.826
Join the line.
Arms distance, please.

41:00.875 --> 41:03.069
You think this is unwise?

41:03.194 --> 41:04.921
Probably.

41:05.046 --> 41:07.757
But this is...

41:07.923 --> 41:10.427
Barrels down, gentlemen.

41:10.593 --> 41:12.804
But a necessary evil, Mr. Toole.

41:12.970 --> 41:16.140
You're speaking of
yourself then, Mr. Bohannon.

41:34.725 --> 41:36.035
Rifle in your left hand.

41:36.201 --> 41:38.245
Cartridges in your right.

41:42.791 --> 41:44.336
Congratulations.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.801
All right, gentlemen.
The rest of y'all,

41:51.967 --> 41:53.803
rifles in your left hand,
barrels facing the sky.

41:53.928 --> 41:56.743
Finger off the trigger.
Take one cartridge in your right hand.

41:56.868 --> 41:57.987
Sharp end is the business end.

41:58.112 --> 41:59.509
Load that cartridge into the cartridge port

41:59.634 --> 42:01.127
on the side of your rifle,
business end first.

42:01.252 --> 42:02.294
Now, on the order to make ready,

42:02.419 --> 42:03.980
rack that lever all the way forward

42:04.272 --> 42:06.032
and all the way back,
loading the round into the chamber.

42:06.057 --> 42:08.134
And... make ready!

42:11.229 --> 42:13.189
You dropped your round.

42:13.314 --> 42:14.574
Pick it up.

42:15.733 --> 42:16.826
Start again.

42:16.992 --> 42:18.861
And... make ready!

42:32.133 --> 42:34.544
Boss man coming through.
Hold your fire.

42:34.669 --> 42:36.137
Boss man coming through!

42:42.626 --> 42:44.855
Anything moves...

42:45.021 --> 42:47.398
Shoot the shit out of it.

42:47.564 --> 42:49.567
