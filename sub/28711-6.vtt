00:19.062 --> 00:20.803
[Madame Xanadu]
Previously on Swamp Thing...

00:20.890 --> 00:22.979
[Daniel]
Have you seen anything more
about my mission?

00:23.066 --> 00:24.285
When you'd first come
to Marais,

00:24.372 --> 00:26.156
you told me
you'd made a bargain.

00:26.243 --> 00:29.029
One that bound you to
this town until called upon.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.553
[screams]

00:31.640 --> 00:33.076
Help!

00:33.163 --> 00:34.773
[Swamp Thing] Who are you?

00:34.860 --> 00:36.645
[Stranger] A passing stranger,

00:36.732 --> 00:38.734
trying to help you understand
the things you already know.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.605
[Remy] Thought you might
be coming around.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.129
[Lucilia] Logbook says that
there was only one other boat

00:42.216 --> 00:44.087
besides Holland's
that went out that night.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.394
Let's just say,
it don't look good
for your boy Matt.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.790
Nobody ever fucking
threatens my son.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.705
[masked man] Liz Tremayne?

00:53.792 --> 00:55.185
You need to stay out of
the pissing-people-off
business.

00:55.272 --> 00:57.318
-[Daniel] Hey, Liz!
-Back off.

00:57.405 --> 00:58.667
-You all right?
-[masked man] Motherfucker!

00:58.754 --> 01:00.538
Daniel! Look out!

01:00.625 --> 01:02.149
[Jason] The sample
that Arcane recovered,

01:02.236 --> 01:03.976
it's from a living creature.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.456
We'll talk about this
in the morning.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.328
Hey, hey. Hey.

01:07.415 --> 01:08.764
You want to me to push
this project forward?

01:08.851 --> 01:11.810
I need it alive
on a table to study.

01:11.897 --> 01:12.855
Find it.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.874
[Alec]  It's very,
very important, Abby,

01:31.961 --> 01:33.441
for me to keep you safe.

01:33.528 --> 01:34.833
[Abby]  Why?

01:34.920 --> 01:35.921
[Alec]
Because I care about you.

01:37.793 --> 01:40.100
[Abby]  You hardly know me.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.536
[Alec]  Well, you can
spend your entire life

01:41.623 --> 01:43.277
with someone
and hardly know them

01:43.364 --> 01:45.757
or you can meet a stranger
and... just like that.

01:45.844 --> 01:47.150
[snaps fingers]

01:47.237 --> 01:48.804
You get 'em.

01:48.891 --> 01:50.719
I felt something
between us.

01:50.806 --> 01:51.850
Didn't you?

01:52.764 --> 01:55.332
[animal whimpering]

02:02.383 --> 02:04.254
[whimpering continues]

02:06.430 --> 02:07.605
[whimpering]

02:23.665 --> 02:24.883
[screams]

02:24.970 --> 02:27.277
[roaring]

02:30.541 --> 02:31.325
[gun fires]

02:34.371 --> 02:35.720
[growling]

02:41.813 --> 02:43.467
[snarls]

02:43.554 --> 02:44.338
[gun fires]

02:48.690 --> 02:49.908
That was solid steel!

02:55.392 --> 02:58.569
Slow down.
Avery wants him alive.

02:58.656 --> 03:00.528
To hell with that.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.486
I ain't getting my ass
mauled for nobody.

03:13.454 --> 03:14.933
[Mike]
What the hell could do that?

03:15.020 --> 03:16.457
[Fraser] Whatever it is,
it's jacked up

03:16.544 --> 03:18.807
on enough ketamine to
take down a fuckin' zoo.

03:30.166 --> 03:30.993
Jesus...

03:32.037 --> 03:34.039
[panting]

03:37.304 --> 03:38.479
[Mike] Christ! What is that?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.353
-[growls]
-[gunshots]

03:44.789 --> 03:46.400
[Mike] It's not going down!

03:46.487 --> 03:48.010
Quick! Get to the boat! Run!

03:48.097 --> 03:48.924
[gunshots]

04:01.719 --> 04:03.025
[screams]

04:03.112 --> 04:03.982
[Mike] What the hell
is happening?

04:08.073 --> 04:09.771
[Mike screams]

04:09.858 --> 04:11.860
Quick! Run!

04:16.125 --> 04:17.996
-[Fraser] Get on the boat!
-[gunfire]

04:32.228 --> 04:34.230
[theme music playing]

05:33.463 --> 05:35.770
[classical music playing]

06:16.027 --> 06:18.378
[Abby] I was making sure
Susie was safe with relatives
when I heard.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.380
I... I still can't
believe this.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.079
And there's
no one we can call?

06:24.166 --> 06:25.863
Family? Friends?

06:25.950 --> 06:28.300
Found what I think was
an old Rolodex in his shop

06:28.388 --> 06:30.433
full of scratched-out
LA numbers.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.697
From his notes,
they're mostly agents
and old surf buddies.

06:38.180 --> 06:41.139
[Abby] Well, the ventilator's
keeping him breathing, but,
um...

06:43.272 --> 06:45.579
His brain activity is...
it's minimal.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.015
Based on these tests,

06:47.102 --> 06:49.539
I'm not sure he's gonna
come out of this.

06:49.626 --> 06:50.801
I poked the bear.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.152
It's my fault, you know.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.154
No, Liz.

06:56.241 --> 06:57.895
You said you and Cassidy
were mugged.

06:57.982 --> 06:59.593
It's not your fault.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.116
Yeah, well, you were dealing
with a lot last night.

07:02.683 --> 07:03.510
What do you mean?

07:04.902 --> 07:06.687
Those assholes
that came at us,

07:06.774 --> 07:09.037
that was a message.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.908
Don't fuck
with Avery Sunderland.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.215
Avery.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.522
The bastard
threatened my dad.

07:15.609 --> 07:17.567
I couldn't let it go.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.177
Liz, it doesn't make sense.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.745
Avery likes your dad.

07:21.832 --> 07:23.399
He likes my dad even better
when his little girl

07:23.486 --> 07:26.228
isn't investigating certain
dirty business practices.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.319
Come on.

07:30.406 --> 07:31.668
Can't be that big
of a surprise.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.670
Did you go to the Sheriff?

07:33.757 --> 07:35.890
I don't have enough
for a story, let alone
to nail Avery.

07:35.977 --> 07:38.327
And that's even if Lucilia
wasn't in his pocket.

07:42.592 --> 07:43.463
What do I do?

07:44.376 --> 07:45.682
You do nothing.

07:45.769 --> 07:48.380
I hit delete,
Avery backs off,

07:48.468 --> 07:49.512
everybody walks away fine.

07:49.599 --> 07:52.472
Everyone except for Daniel.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.386
[Abby] Avery's here
in the hospital.
I'm going to find him.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.562
Abby, let it go!

07:57.085 --> 07:58.521
Abby! Wait!

08:00.784 --> 08:03.178
[monitor beeping]

08:07.617 --> 08:09.619
[Stranger]
It's Cassidy, right?
Stunts?

08:10.968 --> 08:12.796
Yeah.

08:12.883 --> 08:15.712
Ah, was wondering
when the studio would
send somebody out.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.801
[Stranger] You think
we're even gonna get
a shot off tonight?

08:17.888 --> 08:20.717
Not if the D-bag at
the top of the call sheet
has his way.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.504
I'm sorry.
It's been a long night.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.201
Don't apologize.

08:26.288 --> 08:27.550
I appreciate
the honesty, actually.

08:27.637 --> 08:28.595
[Daniel] Yeah.

08:29.944 --> 08:32.163
So tell me...

08:32.250 --> 08:34.688
Would you say that
you feel satisfied
with things?

08:36.298 --> 08:37.299
Here? On set?

08:40.345 --> 08:42.652
Look at this guy.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.393
It's the most acting
he's done all week.

08:45.176 --> 08:46.874
Man...

08:46.961 --> 08:49.311
It's too bad casting only
looks at me like a stunt man.

08:49.398 --> 08:51.531
I'd give anything
to have that role.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.228
Yeah.

08:53.315 --> 08:54.882
Well, I can sense
your passion, all right.

08:56.927 --> 08:57.841
I wonder...

09:00.409 --> 09:01.584
Huh.

09:01.671 --> 09:04.369
Maybe if I put in
a good word,

09:04.456 --> 09:05.849
you might wanna
do me a favor.

09:06.633 --> 09:07.721
A favor?

09:07.808 --> 09:09.157
[monitor beeping]

09:10.332 --> 09:11.594
[doctor] We're trying, Avery.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.074
But she's refusing
all medication.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.771
Well, I don't care.

09:14.858 --> 09:16.164
What happened at the swamp
was a goddamn wake-up call.

09:16.251 --> 09:18.166
Now you're a doctor.
You figure it out.

09:18.253 --> 09:20.647
You give her something
that will make this
behavior stop.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.692
-All right, Doctor?
-Okay.

09:22.779 --> 09:23.606
[Abby] Avery.

09:25.216 --> 09:27.741
Thank you very much, Doctor.
Take care.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.133
Hello, Abby.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.048
God, I am so relieved
that you are okay.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.006
Don't.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.488
Oh, Abby,
if this is about Maria
attacking you like that,

09:36.576 --> 09:38.012
I honestly don't know
what got into her.

09:38.099 --> 09:39.143
-I'm just sorry
I wasn't there...
-Stop.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.973
You threatened Delroy?

09:43.060 --> 09:44.801
You... You sent
people after Liz?

09:49.240 --> 09:50.241
Excuse me.

09:54.855 --> 09:57.074
Those are serious
accusations, Abby.

09:57.161 --> 09:59.033
You want serious?

09:59.120 --> 10:01.601
Cassidy's in a coma
and he will probably
never recover.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.777
Yes, and we're all very
shook up about that boy,

10:03.864 --> 10:05.343
but if there are
hospital bills to be paid,

10:05.430 --> 10:07.041
I am always here.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.260
Yeah, that's right.
Because that's what you do.

10:09.347 --> 10:11.611
You hurt people and then
you pretend to care.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.221
There's no pretend
about it, Abby.

10:13.308 --> 10:14.483
I love this town,

10:14.570 --> 10:15.963
and I love all
the people in it.

10:16.050 --> 10:18.922
When it benefits you
or when it's convenient.

10:19.009 --> 10:21.142
What happens
when I become
inconvenient, Avery?

10:21.229 --> 10:22.360
Are you gonna
send men after me?

10:22.447 --> 10:23.579
-Oh, Abby.
-Don't.

10:23.666 --> 10:24.885
How can you
say that to me?

10:24.972 --> 10:26.103
You are like
a daughter to me.

10:26.190 --> 10:29.063
I would never ever
hurt you.

10:30.151 --> 10:31.413
No.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.893
No, do you know that
there was a time

10:32.980 --> 10:34.808
that I would've believed that?

10:34.895 --> 10:36.853
But you are not the man
that I once knew.

10:38.986 --> 10:41.815
I took you from nothing
and this is how
you pay me back, Abby?

10:41.902 --> 10:43.643
Did you send those men?

10:48.212 --> 10:49.039
Abby...

10:50.737 --> 10:53.043
[whispers]
Go back to Atlanta.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.349
Did you send those men?

10:56.090 --> 10:59.702
Are you sure you wanna
cross that line with me?

10:59.789 --> 11:01.182
[PA beeps]

11:01.269 --> 11:02.531
[man over PA]
Dr. Arcane to the ER.

11:02.618 --> 11:03.880
-Dr. Arcane.
-[scoffs]

11:07.014 --> 11:08.711
I am not a 17-year-old
girl anymore.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.626
You do not scare me
the way you used to.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.716
Stay away from Liz.

11:13.803 --> 11:14.630
Abby.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.461
I'll always
care about you.

11:19.548 --> 11:22.682
But if you ever
accuse me like this again,

11:22.769 --> 11:24.292
I won't be so forgiving.

11:33.518 --> 11:34.824
[Liz] There's something
you need to see.

11:34.911 --> 11:37.000
These two were
just brought in.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.523
They've been yelling
about being attacked

11:38.610 --> 11:40.874
by some kind of
swamp monster.

11:40.961 --> 11:43.006
[Mike]
Get the fuck off me, please!

11:43.093 --> 11:45.835
-[screaming in pain]
-[nurse] Calm down, sir. We'd
like to help you.

11:45.922 --> 11:48.142
[nurses speaking indistinctly]

11:48.229 --> 11:50.057
Did you hear
what they actually saw?

11:50.144 --> 11:51.362
[Mike yelling]

11:51.449 --> 11:53.277
Sounds like
it was dark, but...

11:53.364 --> 11:56.803
Their description
sounds 90%
like your Mr. Holland.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.980
-[screaming]
-[nurses speaking
indistinctly]

12:00.067 --> 12:01.895
[Abby] I don't know.

12:01.982 --> 12:04.158
He couldn't have done this.

12:04.245 --> 12:05.333
Abby, you said
there were times

12:05.420 --> 12:06.551
when he seemed
to lose control.

12:06.638 --> 12:07.944
I know, I know.
But I know Alec,

12:08.031 --> 12:09.250
and if this is him,

12:09.337 --> 12:10.338
there has to be
an explanation.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.342
-[nurses speaking indistinctly]
-[screaming]

12:14.429 --> 12:16.300
I hope it's a good one.

12:16.387 --> 12:17.954
[Mike yelling]

12:22.393 --> 12:23.394
[door closes]

12:28.312 --> 12:30.314
Finished the incident report
on Maria Sunderland.

12:33.665 --> 12:34.492
You all right?

12:39.019 --> 12:40.629
Remy Dubois'
piece of shit brother

12:40.716 --> 12:42.326
came in to ID the body.

12:44.024 --> 12:45.460
Poor guy, he was...

12:46.635 --> 12:48.028
He was crying like a baby.

12:49.464 --> 12:50.857
I don't blame him.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.380
The round that I put
through Remy's skull

12:52.467 --> 12:55.035
didn't... leave much
to the imagination.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.341
Well, I'm sure
whatever went down,

12:57.428 --> 12:58.560
it was justified.

12:59.909 --> 13:00.910
Justified?

13:02.390 --> 13:03.391
Mmm-hmm.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.004
I took a man's life,
Matthew...

13:08.091 --> 13:09.440
In self-defense.

13:09.527 --> 13:10.354
[scoffs]

13:12.748 --> 13:14.445
To protect you.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.449
Dubois,
he fuckin' saw you.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.582
-He saw me? I...
-Shut up!

13:20.669 --> 13:23.106
The night Holland died,
Dubois was working
the docks

13:23.193 --> 13:24.978
when you took out
a Sunderland boat,

13:25.065 --> 13:26.936
and that piece of hull
that Tremayne's friend found,

13:27.023 --> 13:29.460
the one with
the blast marks
and the buckshot holes,

13:29.547 --> 13:30.897
it's a match
to Holland's boat.

13:31.985 --> 13:32.812
[sighs]

13:34.248 --> 13:35.379
You shot him.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.728
And then you went
for the dynamite.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.382
What are you talking about?

13:38.469 --> 13:40.950
-You know me!
-And I know
Avery Sunderland.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.647
Holland must've been
in his way,

13:42.734 --> 13:44.084
which means
he needed him gone.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.042
So he found somebody
he could trust,

13:46.129 --> 13:48.697
somebody he knew
would keep their
damn mouth shut.

13:56.226 --> 13:57.227
So now what?

13:59.490 --> 14:00.491
[sighs]

14:13.156 --> 14:15.071
Well...

14:15.158 --> 14:18.727
Remy's dead and that piece
from Holland's boat,

14:18.814 --> 14:21.251
the lab will just say
it's inconclusive.

14:21.338 --> 14:22.252
No match.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.213
Any other loose ends?

14:26.300 --> 14:28.955
I just...
I don't understand.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.131
He could've picked
half this town.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.307
But he picked you. Why?

14:37.833 --> 14:39.661
Jesus, Matthew.
If you needed the money,

14:39.748 --> 14:42.142
-I could've...
-You'd have what?

14:42.229 --> 14:45.058
You'd have pulled
a couple of dollars
from your rainy day fund?

14:45.145 --> 14:47.451
Remind me again how much
a small town cop makes.

14:47.538 --> 14:48.844
This is not about me.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.933
No, it's your friend Avery,

14:51.020 --> 14:53.588
and the two-inch thick
file he has on you
going back 30 years!

14:55.024 --> 14:56.765
What? You haven't
read that one?

14:56.852 --> 14:59.681
Oh, well,
I highly recommend it.
It's a real beaut.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.466
Bribes, payoffs,

15:02.553 --> 15:05.252
even a couple dropped
bodies in your custody,

15:05.339 --> 15:06.862
long before I ever
came on.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.864
-Enough to put you
away for life!
-Shh!

15:08.951 --> 15:10.822
Son of a bitch.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.607
Everything I did,
I did for you.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.174
No, don't...

15:14.261 --> 15:15.653
Do not put that on me.

15:17.568 --> 15:20.180
Sunderland made it
very clear what he would do

15:20.267 --> 15:21.616
if I didn't go along
with him on Holland.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.313
So you work for Avery now?

15:28.579 --> 15:30.407
At least it's better than
sleeping with him.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.892
Do you understand
what he has taken from you?

15:36.979 --> 15:39.025
I protected you,
that's what I did.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.680
The same as you've
always done for me.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.207
Stop. Just stop! Just stop!

15:48.730 --> 15:50.950
You know
what I been thinkin'?

15:51.037 --> 15:52.734
I been thinkin'
that maybe it is time

15:52.821 --> 15:55.563
to start applying
to other departments.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.217
Lake Charles, Houma...

15:57.304 --> 16:00.133
I can just be done
with you, Avery,

16:00.220 --> 16:02.874
and this whole...
lousy town.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.485
-[door opens]
-[Tyler] Hey, Sheriff.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.226
Just got a call
from Marais General.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.621
A couple of swamp hunters
got attacked by a wild animal

16:10.708 --> 16:12.014
out on Layton's Point.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.544
[Matt] Animal control
can handle it
in the morning.

16:20.631 --> 16:21.850
Nope, you go tonight.

16:21.937 --> 16:24.287
I want you out of
my fucking sight!

16:32.904 --> 16:34.341
[door opens]

16:35.168 --> 16:36.212
[door slams]

16:40.390 --> 16:43.350
[monitor beeping]

17:27.394 --> 17:28.873
[Daniel]  You know,
in this business,

17:28.960 --> 17:30.223
when someone
asks for a favor...

17:30.310 --> 17:32.094
[laughs]

17:32.181 --> 17:34.444
No, it's nothing like that.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.142
Strictly on the up and up.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.187
My plate's just
pretty full.

17:38.274 --> 17:41.016
I've got a number of
other projects that
I need to oversee.

17:41.103 --> 17:44.280
It'd be great
if I could have someone
here in Marais.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.282
Someone I could trust
who could, uh...

17:47.283 --> 17:49.068
make themselves available.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.895
What are you lookin' for?
Just another stunt man?

17:50.982 --> 17:52.158
No.

17:52.245 --> 17:54.247
No, you'd play
a different role.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.987
After this movie,
of course.

17:58.990 --> 17:59.948
Starring role?

18:01.732 --> 18:03.038
Very important role.

18:06.128 --> 18:09.436
I don't have
all the details
just yet.

18:09.523 --> 18:13.092
There'll be a woman
coming to Marais soon.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.397
You can learn
more from her.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.227
Good luck, Mr. Cassidy.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.365
-[director] Cassidy.
-What's up?

18:25.452 --> 18:27.323
The studio is fed up
with Wayne's bullshit.

18:27.410 --> 18:28.846
All right? They're ready
to cut their losses,

18:28.933 --> 18:31.632
unless we re-cast...
like now.

18:31.719 --> 18:32.894
You've been running
lines with him.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.156
They've seen
the rehearsals,

18:35.157 --> 18:36.419
and they like your style.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.856
-So...
-You're givin' me a shot?

18:38.943 --> 18:40.771
-At the Blue Devil?
-Yeah.

18:41.511 --> 18:42.295
Hey...

18:45.036 --> 18:46.081
Where'd that studio guy go?

18:47.561 --> 18:48.823
[director] What studio guy?

18:51.304 --> 18:54.437
-[monitor beeping]
-[breathing heavily]

18:56.047 --> 18:57.745
[beeping intensifies]

18:59.573 --> 19:02.053
[monitor alarm sounding]

19:13.717 --> 19:14.544
Daniel?

19:15.763 --> 19:16.894
Daniel, can you hear me?

19:17.939 --> 19:19.854
[grunts loudly]

19:19.941 --> 19:21.072
[monitor beeping frantically]

19:22.987 --> 19:25.033
[coughing]

19:25.120 --> 19:26.513
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.123
You got hurt in a fight,
but you're safe, okay?

19:28.210 --> 19:29.820
-[Daniel] Ahh! I'm burning up!
-You're okay.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.474
-I'm burning up!
-Hey! It's okay!

19:31.561 --> 19:32.910
It's okay! It's okay!

19:32.997 --> 19:34.042
-[skin sizzles]
-[Liz winces] What the...

19:34.129 --> 19:35.826
[Jason] I heard the alarm!

19:35.913 --> 19:37.001
[Daniel]
What's wrong with me?
I'm burning up!

19:37.088 --> 19:39.265
-He's awake.
-Who are you?

19:39.352 --> 19:40.744
Dr. Woodrue.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.920
Sunderland's guy?
Are you Daniel's doctor?

19:43.007 --> 19:44.270
[Jason] No.

19:44.357 --> 19:45.967
But I heard the commotion
and I...

19:46.054 --> 19:47.795
I'm sorry.
When did he regain
consciousness?

19:47.882 --> 19:49.536
Just now! Look at him!
He's burning up!

19:49.623 --> 19:51.015
Go get a nurse.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.321
Go now. I'll stay close.
You go get a nurse!

19:52.408 --> 19:54.410
-Go, go, go!
-[Daniel groans in pain]

19:54.497 --> 19:56.630
[Daniel] I made a deal.
I made a deal.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.327
The stranger said
I couldn't leave Marais

19:58.414 --> 19:59.981
until after I fulfilled
my end of the bargain...

20:00.068 --> 20:02.201
Mr. Cassidy, you shouldn't
even be awake right now.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.419
Help me, Doc!
Help me!

20:03.506 --> 20:04.768
-I'm burning up!
-Help! Help!

20:06.683 --> 20:08.076
[Daniel groaning]

20:16.432 --> 20:17.651
[Liz] Woodrue.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.000
I couldn't stop him.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.567
[stammers] I'll notify
the authorities.

20:20.654 --> 20:22.699
The authorities?

20:22.786 --> 20:26.007
Mr. Cassidy could be
a danger to himself
and others.

20:26.094 --> 20:27.226
Just...

20:27.313 --> 20:29.140
I know him.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.533
Just give me
a chance to find him
and bring him back.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.453
[boat engine humming]

20:51.641 --> 20:52.816
Alec?

20:52.903 --> 20:54.209
Whatever happened
to those people,

20:54.296 --> 20:57.212
I know you had a reason.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.258
[Swamp Thing]
Did they tell you
about the monster

20:59.345 --> 21:00.389
that attacked them?

21:02.217 --> 21:03.174
Alec...

21:04.828 --> 21:06.482
You were
defending yourself.

21:06.569 --> 21:09.224
They were attacking you.

21:09.311 --> 21:12.096
You are suffering from
a condition that we...

21:16.797 --> 21:17.754
That we don't understand.

21:20.366 --> 21:23.978
I know that you are
frightened and frustrated.

21:27.329 --> 21:28.765
I'm not going to
give up on you.

21:33.509 --> 21:34.554
You're still Alec Holland.

21:37.774 --> 21:38.558
Am I?

21:40.908 --> 21:44.085
I feel more in common
with the green in this place

21:44.172 --> 21:46.348
than anything
I've ever felt before.

21:48.437 --> 21:50.134
What's the green?

21:50.221 --> 21:52.572
-[boat engine humming]
-[indistinct chatter]

21:59.318 --> 22:00.493
-[Swamp Thing
breathes heavily]
-Hey.

22:03.104 --> 22:04.584
We don't even know
who that is.

22:04.671 --> 22:06.237
They're coming for me.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.153
This isn't going to stop.

22:13.244 --> 22:14.333
Alec!

22:16.291 --> 22:17.161
Alec?

22:20.034 --> 22:21.470
[knocking at door]

22:23.472 --> 22:25.256
It's late and I'm tired.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.346
-This better be important.
-Yes.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.871
If I understand correctly,

22:30.958 --> 22:33.264
I heard that the two hunters
that you recommended

22:33.352 --> 22:35.354
to retrieve the living
specimen failed.

22:36.746 --> 22:38.008
Thanks for that information.

22:38.095 --> 22:40.097
You know what?
Good night, Doctor.

22:40.184 --> 22:42.317
I only mention it
because you had asked
for something tangible.

22:42.404 --> 22:45.015
Yeah? To justify further
investment into my research.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.408
I didn't ask for
something tangible.

22:46.495 --> 22:47.714
I don't care about
anything tangible.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.280
I need results, Woodrue.

22:49.803 --> 22:50.760
Results.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.762
Well, perhaps you heard...

22:52.849 --> 22:55.156
There was
an unfortunate incident

22:55.243 --> 22:57.114
involving a Daniel Cassidy?

22:57.854 --> 22:59.334
[sighs]

22:59.421 --> 23:00.857
Word gets around.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.424
Doctors say he's in
an irreversible coma.

23:02.511 --> 23:03.817
Oh, he was.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.253
Until an hour ago.

23:07.473 --> 23:09.649
Daniel Cassidy regained
consciousness.

23:09.736 --> 23:12.956
He's speaking.
He has full mobility.

23:13.043 --> 23:16.133
And it's supposed
to mean something
to me because...

23:16.220 --> 23:20.137
Mr. Cassidy suffered
a grave brain injury.

23:20.224 --> 23:23.445
Chances for recovery
were virtually nil.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.536
Until I intervened.

23:29.364 --> 23:30.800
What the hell
you talkin' about?

23:32.411 --> 23:33.847
Mutagenic regeneration.

23:35.370 --> 23:36.763
Here.

23:36.850 --> 23:39.156
I synthesized the sample
that was given to me

23:39.243 --> 23:41.811
by your Dr. Arcane.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.944
I had it administered
to Mr. Cassidy.

23:44.031 --> 23:45.380
Now, remember...

23:45.467 --> 23:47.121
His condition was grave.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.689
But within hours
of receiving the mutagen,

23:49.776 --> 23:51.734
it appears that
his brain regenerated

23:51.821 --> 23:53.432
to the point of
full consciousness.

23:55.216 --> 23:59.960
And this happened
because you spun
a magic potion

24:00.047 --> 24:04.051
from the sample
Abby took out of
the swamp.

24:04.138 --> 24:06.445
You asked for results,
Mr. Sunderland.

24:07.620 --> 24:09.491
I'm giving you...

24:09.578 --> 24:12.451
a discovery that could
change the world.

24:15.889 --> 24:17.673
You woke a man from a coma.

24:20.633 --> 24:21.895
That'll get attention.

24:22.635 --> 24:23.592
Indeed.

24:25.681 --> 24:27.161
Well...

24:27.248 --> 24:28.815
I'll prepare
a testing regimen...

24:28.902 --> 24:30.686
No, no, no, what you're
gonna do, Doctor,

24:30.773 --> 24:34.168
you're gonna write
a report on your findings
tonight, now.

24:34.255 --> 24:36.083
I don't understand
what anything says
right there,

24:36.170 --> 24:37.867
but you're gonna
make a report,

24:37.954 --> 24:39.173
and you're gonna add every damn
graph and colored picture

24:39.260 --> 24:41.871
you can find,
but use short words.

24:41.958 --> 24:43.307
When I'm on
the other end
of the transaction,

24:43.394 --> 24:44.395
I insist on it.

24:46.093 --> 24:47.834
Uh, in the interim,

24:47.921 --> 24:49.226
there is something else

24:49.313 --> 24:50.401
that could be of value
going forward.

24:51.533 --> 24:52.795
Go on.

24:52.882 --> 24:55.842
Dr. Arcane. She has,
to this point,

24:55.929 --> 24:58.932
been reluctant
to fully share information.

25:04.111 --> 25:05.852
You tell me what you need
from Abby,

25:05.939 --> 25:07.244
and I'll get it for you.

25:09.856 --> 25:12.989
[Matt] The hunters said
they came across some tracks
somewhere around here.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.643
[Tyler] It's the goddamn
middle of nowhere.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.036
[Matt] Tell me about it.

25:20.606 --> 25:22.042
All right.

25:22.129 --> 25:23.957
Take a look around.

25:24.044 --> 25:26.176
Try to identify
any sign before
the rain wipes it clean.

25:26.263 --> 25:28.048
We should lock down
the general area,

25:28.135 --> 25:29.528
we'll come back in the light
and we could...

25:43.542 --> 25:44.760
Toss me that shotgun.

25:44.847 --> 25:46.501
Yeah.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.155
Whatever it is,
it's big.

25:48.242 --> 25:49.548
So if you see it,
you call me.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.640
I'm gonna follow these tracks.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.772
See if I can't flush this thing
out into the open.

25:57.730 --> 25:59.209
You take the skiff,

25:59.296 --> 26:00.733
get around to the other
side of this inlet.

26:03.605 --> 26:04.606
[shotgun cocks]

26:11.265 --> 26:12.092
Shit.

26:12.875 --> 26:13.876
Shit!

26:15.225 --> 26:16.052
[exhales]

26:18.664 --> 26:19.621
Jesus.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.021
[Matt]
Hey, we're in the right place.
Keep your eyes open.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.206
I might have something.

26:51.087 --> 26:51.914
[exhales]

26:53.524 --> 26:54.351
[branch snaps]

26:57.528 --> 26:58.965
[Matt] Abby?

26:59.052 --> 27:00.880
What the fuck
are you doing
out here?

27:00.967 --> 27:02.751
Look, I can explain.
We have to get back
to the boat now.

27:02.838 --> 27:04.448
No, this is crazy.
It's not safe for you
to be out here.

27:04.535 --> 27:05.841
-No, please just
listen to me.
-No, listen to me!

27:05.928 --> 27:07.060
Okay? Two more people
got attacked.

27:07.147 --> 27:08.583
We found tracks
leadin' this way.

27:08.670 --> 27:08.888
-Wait, you're not alone?
-Tyler's in the boat.

27:10.454 --> 27:11.630
What the hell
is goin' on with you?

27:13.240 --> 27:14.633
[leaves rustling]

27:14.720 --> 27:15.938
-[Matt yells] Abby, run!
-Matt, don't shoot!

27:16.025 --> 27:16.983
[gunshot]

27:18.288 --> 27:19.333
Not him!

27:19.420 --> 27:20.464
Alec, stop it!

27:21.727 --> 27:23.119
Alec?

27:23.206 --> 27:24.251
[Abby] Alec, please!

27:26.427 --> 27:28.124
[Matt panting]

27:33.913 --> 27:35.001
[wheezing]

27:41.616 --> 27:42.530
It's Alec Holland.

27:43.836 --> 27:45.751
-No... No.
-He's alive.

27:45.838 --> 27:47.404
That can't be.
That's... That's impossible.

27:47.491 --> 27:48.841
-It's impossible!
-It's not. It's not.

27:48.928 --> 27:50.320
I know, I know,
I can't explain it,

27:50.407 --> 27:52.322
but he survived.

27:52.409 --> 27:55.935
And the swamp, it...
it affected him,
it changed him.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.850
And he's only trying
to defend himself.

27:57.937 --> 27:59.286
Okay, so... so...

27:59.373 --> 28:01.288
-Holland's alive?
-Yes.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.725
I know... I know
it's hard to understand...

28:03.812 --> 28:04.900
But it's true.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.175
Does he, um...

28:20.611 --> 28:22.483
Does he remember anything?

28:22.570 --> 28:24.398
From the explosion
or anything,

28:24.485 --> 28:26.400
that night in the swamp?

28:26.487 --> 28:27.488
[Swamp Thing] The boat.

28:28.837 --> 28:30.273
Someone in the dark.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.535
A flash.

28:39.543 --> 28:41.154
I remember you.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.198
It's okay, it's okay.

28:44.157 --> 28:45.985
You were at the bridge.

28:46.072 --> 28:48.291
You came to help Abby.

28:50.946 --> 28:52.208
[Tyler on radio]
Matt, do you copy?

28:52.295 --> 28:53.644
Find anything?

28:54.863 --> 28:55.908
No, Matt, don't.

28:57.083 --> 28:58.562
But I gotta...
I gotta respond.

28:58.649 --> 29:01.174
No, no, no, no one else
can know he's here.

29:01.261 --> 29:04.655
Give me the chance
to save him, please.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.483
-[Tyler]  Matt, do you copy?
-[Abby] Please.

29:07.093 --> 29:07.876
Please.

29:11.227 --> 29:12.098
[sighs]

29:12.185 --> 29:13.012
Cable here.

29:14.709 --> 29:15.841
Look, I thought
I found something.

29:15.928 --> 29:17.538
Turns out it was
just a buck deer.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.670
The call was bullshit.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.020
Headed back to
where you dropped me.

29:36.078 --> 29:38.167
Jason. It's late.

29:40.735 --> 29:42.519
I'm, uh...

29:42.606 --> 29:43.956
I'm not, uh...
I'm not tired.

29:44.521 --> 29:45.348
Mmm-hmm.

29:52.051 --> 29:54.793
I'll, uh... I'll be
with you soon.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.405
I wanna go home, Jason.

30:02.888 --> 30:05.760
I... I understand, uh...

30:05.847 --> 30:07.806
As soon as I finish
this presentation.

30:07.893 --> 30:11.635
Once we secure
full funding
for this project,

30:11.722 --> 30:13.724
-I'll be able to go...
-Not later.

30:14.638 --> 30:15.465
Now.

30:16.510 --> 30:17.380
Tonight.

30:21.123 --> 30:22.864
I can't leave now.

30:22.951 --> 30:25.736
No, not when I'm so close.

30:34.528 --> 30:35.355
What is it?

30:40.273 --> 30:41.491
What's bothering you?

30:43.058 --> 30:44.886
Hmm?

30:44.973 --> 30:47.323
I overheard you
with Sunderland.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.238
Caroline...

30:49.325 --> 30:51.545
We made the discovery
of a lifetime!

30:51.632 --> 30:54.287
Imagine the possibilities!

30:54.374 --> 30:57.551
Regenerative therapies
for disease that...

30:57.638 --> 31:01.033
-That could revolutionize
medicine.
-At what price?

31:01.120 --> 31:04.210
-What are you...
-Human experimentation?

31:04.297 --> 31:08.518
You used an untested drug
on a human subject.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.303
Jason!

31:10.390 --> 31:12.000
If the college regents
find out...

31:12.087 --> 31:13.349
The college regents
haven't had

31:13.436 --> 31:15.090
an intelligent idea
in 50 years!

31:16.744 --> 31:19.225
You are a respected
professor.

31:19.312 --> 31:20.791
We have had a good life.

31:20.879 --> 31:21.967
Please don't
throw it away

31:22.054 --> 31:23.403
for a man like
Avery Sunderland.

31:31.890 --> 31:32.716
I...

31:33.674 --> 31:35.415
I can't... I can't leave.

31:39.506 --> 31:41.247
-I can't.
-I know.

31:43.989 --> 31:44.990
I can't leave.

31:47.296 --> 31:48.167
I know.

31:51.387 --> 31:53.824
I just don't wanna lose
the man you used to be.

32:09.579 --> 32:10.406
[door opens]

32:12.539 --> 32:13.627
[door closes]

32:21.765 --> 32:22.941
[Liz] Daniel?

32:25.987 --> 32:28.381
Daniel, it's Liz.
Are you here?

32:32.472 --> 32:33.734
[Daniel yells]

32:33.821 --> 32:34.865
[Liz] Shit!

32:36.737 --> 32:38.260
[Daniel panting]

32:38.347 --> 32:39.870
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.002
I'm on fire, Liz.

32:41.089 --> 32:42.743
It's tearing me up.

32:42.830 --> 32:44.440
I can't take it!

32:44.527 --> 32:46.573
He's gotta know something.
Where's the keys?

32:46.660 --> 32:48.401
-Where are my keys?
-Who do you have
to go talk to?

32:48.488 --> 32:49.837
Sunderland's guy.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.621
-That doctor.
-Woodrue?

32:51.708 --> 32:52.971
It was him, Liz.

32:54.102 --> 32:55.321
Let's... Let's just...

32:55.408 --> 32:56.583
Daniel, hey.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.150
-[skin sizzles]
-[Liz winces]

32:58.237 --> 33:00.456
-You're still burning up.
-I gotta go find Woodrue.

33:00.543 --> 33:02.328
He knows somethin', Liz.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.634
Let me just get you
back to the hospital!

33:05.722 --> 33:06.810
Shit.

33:12.425 --> 33:13.513
[operator]  911.

33:13.600 --> 33:14.993
Yeah. I have
a situation here.

33:20.128 --> 33:21.869
[Daniel in distance] Doc!

33:21.956 --> 33:22.957
[Daniel groans]

33:23.436 --> 33:24.524
Doc!

33:26.874 --> 33:27.918
Woodrue!

33:30.965 --> 33:31.792
Doc!

33:34.664 --> 33:35.491
[screams]

33:36.318 --> 33:37.493
[Daniel] Woodrue!

33:37.580 --> 33:38.668
[groaning]

33:39.713 --> 33:41.280
Stay inside.

33:41.367 --> 33:42.281
Lock the door.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.423
[sobbing] Doc...

33:54.510 --> 33:55.772
-Cassidy.
-[Daniel grunts] Doc...

33:55.859 --> 33:57.644
Mr. Cassidy.

33:57.731 --> 33:59.124
I can't stand this.

33:59.211 --> 34:01.343
[stammers] Your recovery
is truly remarkable.

34:01.430 --> 34:02.736
I'm burnin' up!
Make it stop!

34:02.823 --> 34:04.564
I'll have you returned
to the hospital.

34:04.651 --> 34:07.958
The testing will tell us
what's provoking this
reaction.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.221
What did they do?

34:09.308 --> 34:12.354
Extreme measures
were required

34:12.441 --> 34:14.791
to prompt your
regenerative cycle.

34:14.878 --> 34:16.532
They did this
on purpose to me?

34:16.619 --> 34:18.143
Yes, and it worked.

34:18.230 --> 34:20.319
The side effects
are unexpected,

34:20.406 --> 34:22.321
-but it... it worked.
-Unexpected?

34:22.408 --> 34:23.626
I'm burnin' up!

34:26.238 --> 34:28.153
I can't stand this!

34:28.240 --> 34:29.676
Jason, help him!

34:29.763 --> 34:31.982
-[Daniel groans]
-Get back inside.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.289
-You can't leave him
like this!
-Go back!

34:34.376 --> 34:35.464
[Daniel snarls]

34:40.382 --> 34:41.427
[shotgun fires]

34:41.514 --> 34:42.471
[yells]

34:45.213 --> 34:47.607
[Avery] You better settle
the hell down, Cassidy.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.391
You gotta do somethin'.
Doc...

34:49.478 --> 34:50.697
You gotta do somethin'.

34:50.784 --> 34:52.655
He... You gotta stop it!

34:52.742 --> 34:53.787
[both yelling]

34:57.399 --> 34:58.792
[Avery] Don't do it!

34:58.879 --> 35:00.098
Last warning, Cassidy!

35:02.535 --> 35:03.840
[grunts]

35:10.586 --> 35:11.805
[Daniel panting]

35:15.852 --> 35:17.158
This your magnificent
breakthrough?

35:20.857 --> 35:23.425
[Jason]
There appears to be some
unfortunate side effects

35:23.512 --> 35:26.124
with the regenerative
process.

35:26.211 --> 35:27.603
[Avery] Unfortunate?

35:27.690 --> 35:29.605
This man is psychotic.

35:29.692 --> 35:30.780
He's out of his mind
with pain.

35:30.867 --> 35:32.391
Look at this.

35:32.478 --> 35:33.827
[Jason] I said I needed
more time for tests.

35:34.784 --> 35:35.698
Perhaps...

35:37.613 --> 35:39.528
You should postpone
the investors

35:39.615 --> 35:43.141
while I find
a solution for this.

35:43.228 --> 35:45.534
We're not postponing
anything.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.057
As far as my investors
are concerned,

35:47.145 --> 35:50.017
we have found
the Holy Grail.

35:50.104 --> 35:51.323
[sirens approaching]

35:51.410 --> 35:53.803
And I expect your report
to reflect that.

35:53.890 --> 35:57.242
Now you let me handle
the authorities.

35:57.329 --> 35:59.200
We'll be sure
Cassidy gets
the help he needs.

35:59.287 --> 36:02.072
[sirens wailing]

36:02.160 --> 36:04.074
[Matt]  You really think
you can help him?

36:04.162 --> 36:05.859
[Abby]
He's changed in ways
I can't even understand.

36:05.946 --> 36:07.252
It's like a whole
different world

36:07.339 --> 36:08.905
is pulsing
through him now.

36:09.645 --> 36:10.951
Different how?

36:11.038 --> 36:12.953
He says that's something
out there. A...

36:13.040 --> 36:14.302
A darkness.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.567
He says it's a force
unlike anything
we've ever seen.

36:19.133 --> 36:21.179
Jesus.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.485
Yeah, I know, I know
this must sound
so crazy to you.

36:23.572 --> 36:25.357
No, I'm...

36:25.444 --> 36:28.534
starting to get
used to it by now.

36:28.621 --> 36:30.318
I'm sorry I left you
in the dark about this.

36:34.409 --> 36:35.845
Are you gonna be okay?

36:35.932 --> 36:36.759
Yeah.

36:37.891 --> 36:38.892
I'll just file a report,

36:38.979 --> 36:40.198
tuck it away somewhere.

36:41.851 --> 36:42.678
Thank you.

36:44.637 --> 36:45.899
But I get it now.

36:47.596 --> 36:48.684
The reason why
you've been spending

36:48.771 --> 36:51.165
so much time
in the swamp.

36:51.252 --> 36:53.820
Why you didn't leave
Marais with the rest
of the CDC.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.782
You can still
come back with me, Abby.

37:05.614 --> 37:07.573
I can't.
[stammers] I can't.

37:07.660 --> 37:09.879
I'm sorry,
I have to help him.

37:11.925 --> 37:12.752
[exhales]

37:53.271 --> 37:54.402
We need to talk.

37:57.797 --> 37:59.625
[monitor beeping]

38:12.028 --> 38:13.291
I know you feel trapped.

38:15.510 --> 38:17.077
Your fate was written
eight years ago

38:17.164 --> 38:19.732
by forces you couldn't
possibly understand.

38:19.819 --> 38:21.473
The stranger you met...

38:21.560 --> 38:23.910
He must've seen
something in you.

38:23.997 --> 38:26.129
I know because
I've seen it too.

38:28.088 --> 38:29.742
I should've told you more.

38:29.829 --> 38:33.441
But even now,
your future
remains unclear.

38:33.528 --> 38:36.139
Your mission,
the reason you were
tasked to Marais...

38:36.226 --> 38:37.576
is still to come.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.012
I can't change that.

38:42.668 --> 38:44.670
But I like you, Daniel.

38:44.757 --> 38:46.367
That's more than
I can say about many

38:46.454 --> 38:48.021
I've met over
my many years.

38:48.935 --> 38:51.677
So while I can't...

38:51.764 --> 38:54.506
I can't interfere
with your destiny,

38:54.593 --> 38:56.377
perhaps I can
offer you some...

38:58.423 --> 39:02.035
relief from the pain
you're experiencing.

39:04.167 --> 39:06.169
[monitor beeping
slows down]

39:08.998 --> 39:10.826
Rest easy now, Daniel.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.615
We'll keep this
our little secret.

39:37.113 --> 39:38.332
[Abby]  You're
such a good boy.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.249
It's almost worth
coming back just for him.

39:43.555 --> 39:44.556
[Alec] Come here.

39:46.253 --> 39:47.341
-Thank you.
-Here.

39:57.003 --> 40:00.789
It's strange how we keep
finding ourselves here.

40:00.876 --> 40:02.965
I want to find
new answers.

40:03.052 --> 40:06.055
You know,
we haven't explored
every medical avenue yet.

40:06.142 --> 40:07.579
It's because
there's a chance

40:07.666 --> 40:09.189
that there are
no answers.

40:11.104 --> 40:12.061
What am I missing?

40:14.542 --> 40:15.500
Please,
please talk to me.

40:22.724 --> 40:25.640
A stranger came to me
in the swamp.

40:25.727 --> 40:27.729
I think he wants me
to look more deeply

40:27.816 --> 40:30.950
into this green
that surrounds me.

40:31.037 --> 40:33.169
But I don't know
how far that will
take me away

40:33.256 --> 40:34.606
from who I was before.

40:40.089 --> 40:41.264
Away from you.

40:43.789 --> 40:44.572
Well...

40:46.748 --> 40:47.749
I'm still here.

40:49.751 --> 40:50.839
You're still...

40:52.885 --> 40:54.539
[branches creaking]

40:57.498 --> 40:58.456
[Abby] What's that?

40:59.761 --> 41:00.762
[Swamp Thing] I'm not sure.

41:25.613 --> 41:26.658
Alec.

41:28.442 --> 41:29.530
Abby?

41:34.317 --> 41:36.319
