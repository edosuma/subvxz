<i>* When I wake up in the</i>

00:06.873 --> 00:09.776
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.809 --> 00:12.679
<i>* By the time I grab my books</i>

00:12.712 --> 00:16.015

00:21.921 --> 00:24.958

00:58.925 --> 01:02.062
<i>* It's all right,</i>
<i>'cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:06.900 --> 01:10.236
Every student council meeting
has one thing in common...

01:10.270 --> 01:11.971
Screaming teenagers.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.076
- ( gavel bangs )
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:16.643 --> 01:19.746
Please!

01:19.779 --> 01:23.583
Now, does anyone
else have anything
to bring before the council?

01:23.616 --> 01:27.921
I do. The cheerleading squad
desperately needs
$600 for new uniforms.

01:27.954 --> 01:30.590
Let's give them $200
and make them wear bikinis.

01:30.623 --> 01:32.325
- Yeah!
- Yeah, woo-hoo!

01:32.359 --> 01:34.828
( laughs )

01:35.762 --> 01:37.130
Good one, Zack.

01:37.163 --> 01:41.101
Don't encourage him,
he should be caged.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.870
I support the cheerleaders.
They represent
our high school.

01:43.903 --> 01:46.906
Their uniforms should have
the dignity
these ladies deserve.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.108
- All right.
- ( Zack laughs )

01:48.108 --> 01:48.975
Oh, yeah.

01:49.009 --> 01:52.379
Wait a minute, now.
$600 is a lot of money.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.781
We have money. How healthy
is our treasury, Wendy?

01:54.814 --> 01:57.684
It's on life support.
They've sent for a priest.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.054
I'm afraid
the numbers never lie.

02:01.054 --> 02:04.057
- Maybe next year, girls.
- Any other motions?

02:04.057 --> 02:06.726
Yeah, let's see
the cheerleaders in motion.

02:07.660 --> 02:09.729
( laughs )

02:12.098 --> 02:14.334
I'm sorry, Jessie,
I'll never laugh again.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.804
No, wait a minute.
How hard can it
be to raise $600?

02:17.837 --> 02:19.339
Okay, the floor is open
for suggestions.

02:19.372 --> 02:22.942
How about a date auction?
I bet a lot of girls would bid
on Zack and Slater.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.079
Yeah, we could auction off
dates to the Spring Dance.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.815
Auctioning off dates
is sexist flesh peddling

02:28.848 --> 02:30.850
and should be
strictly forbidden.

02:30.884 --> 02:33.887
- All in favor?
- All: Aye.

02:37.090 --> 02:40.226
Did you see the way Brian
looked at me when he said
we were dignified?

02:40.260 --> 02:42.228
- He likes me.
- He likes you?

02:42.262 --> 02:44.998
What are you talking about?
He just ignored
you completely.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.967
You noticed it, too? I love it
when they play hard to get.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.805
I can't believe you two
voted against me.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.841
Auctioning off dates
is just
a glorified meat market.

02:54.874 --> 02:58.812
Quit beefin', woman.
I'm single
and I'm after a prime hunk.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.418
I bet I bring in more cash
then you at the auction.

03:05.452 --> 03:08.722
Dream on, Curly. It will be
the easiest
money I'll ever make.

03:08.755 --> 03:11.124
Oh yeah?
Watch ''Dr. Love'' operate.

03:13.693 --> 03:18.131
Claudia,
how much would you pay
to go out on a date with me?

03:18.164 --> 03:20.967
Now take your time, babe.
Big numbers are tough.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.069
$50, not to date you.

03:23.069 --> 03:25.105
Ow!

03:25.138 --> 03:27.807
Beat that, knuckleheads.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.976
- See you later, buddy.
- ( bell rings )

03:31.511 --> 03:35.181
We've got to stop
this disgusting, sexist,
dehumanizing auction.

03:35.215 --> 03:39.085
Come on, lighten up.
It'll be fun.
Besides, you can bid on me.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.987
It's just the principle.
I can't believe

03:41.087 --> 03:43.289
my own boyfriend
doesn't even support me.

03:43.323 --> 03:47.127
Go ahead... sell your muscles.
But I'm not
going to bid on them.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.767
It's not good to be afraid
of your girlfriend.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.803
Hey, Lisa, what do you
think of this?

04:00.306 --> 04:03.710
I think it will scare
the fleas off of my dog.

04:07.113 --> 04:11.051
Hi, Brian.
It was really nice of you
to support the cheerleaders.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.318
It was nothing.

04:16.555 --> 04:19.259
- What are you reading?
- <i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i>.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.894
Oh, a football book.

04:23.263 --> 04:28.068
No, the hunchback didn't make
the team. This is a classic.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.771
Ever read
<i>Confessions of a Mall Queen?</i>
It's a classic, too.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.541
Shucks, I'm afraid
I missed that one.

04:34.574 --> 04:36.910
Oh, don't worry,
I can lend you my copy.

04:39.312 --> 04:42.916
So, does your girlfriend mind
that you're in the auction?

04:42.949 --> 04:44.884
I don't have a girlfriend.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.353
( quietly )
All right!

04:48.221 --> 04:51.157
- Excuse me?
- It's all right to be single.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.560
It's my favorite quality
in a man.

04:53.593 --> 04:56.296
If you'll excuse me,
l have to go to
a French lecture.

04:56.329 --> 04:58.965
Well, as they say in France,

04:58.998 --> 05:01.101
"Ba-bye, baby."

05:02.035 --> 05:04.070
Sure.

05:06.139 --> 05:10.543
Ah... Linda, Linda, Linda.
What a beautiful name.

05:10.577 --> 05:14.047
It is, but mine is Lydia.

05:14.047 --> 05:17.217
Lydia, Lydia, Lydia.
Oh, it's so much
nicer than Linda.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.052
The date auction
is just a few days away.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.287
- Did you make
any decisions, yet?
- Not yet.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.590
Well, maybe you need
some coaching.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.158
Hi,
can I get you guys anything?

05:25.191 --> 05:27.227
Not unless you have
a date with Lydia on the menu.

05:29.195 --> 05:32.932
Now, about this date auction,

05:32.966 --> 05:35.902
if any one of you sweeties
dare bid on my Slater,

05:35.935 --> 05:38.838
I'll hunt you
down in the streets
like a rabid dog.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.375
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

05:47.981 --> 05:51.317
Come on, Jessie, lighten up.
This date auction
is for a good cause.

05:51.351 --> 05:56.322
Besides, the guys want
to do it. So it's
not sexist... it's sexy.

05:56.356 --> 06:00.226
You both make
interesting points.
Really... fascinating.

06:00.260 --> 06:04.364
But if either of
you bid on Slater,
you're dead. You got me?

06:07.434 --> 06:12.305
Who put sandpaper
on her toilet seat?

06:12.339 --> 06:15.408
Our next hunk to
be auctioned off
is Herbert Hotis.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.184
Herbert is Sergeant-at-Arms
of the Insect Club.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.887
We'll start the bidding at $5.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.956
Do I hear five?
Gimme, gimme five?

06:31.091 --> 06:32.258
( both sigh heavily )

06:32.292 --> 06:36.229
Going once, twice,
sold to Merris
Clement for 15 cents.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.466
I didn't even expect that.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.409
Our next participant
is a straight-A student,

06:49.442 --> 06:52.078
and Vice-President
of the Student Council.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.681
He is our very own
Brian Watkins.

06:54.714 --> 06:58.318
( applause and cheers )

06:58.351 --> 07:01.421
This one's mine.
Let the games begin.

07:02.489 --> 07:04.424
Do I hear a $5 donation?

07:04.457 --> 07:07.193
- $5!
- Uh... $20.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.363
- $25.
- 30!

07:10.397 --> 07:13.166
You top that, and I'll tell
everyone in school
about your training bra.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.238
I have $30.
Going once...

07:19.172 --> 07:22.108
Going twice...

07:22.142 --> 07:25.211
You are promised
to Lisa Turtle for $30.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.114
Charge 'em, please.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.521
Next up, AC Slater.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.461
Show them those biceps, son.
Yeah!

07:41.494 --> 07:43.530
Hey, we'll start
the bidding at $5.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.370
Okay... give me $4.

07:50.403 --> 07:54.207
- Jessie, bid on him.
- Get real, missy.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.310
$3?

07:57.344 --> 08:00.347
Poor Slater, he looks
so embarrassed. l bid $10.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.448
( everyone gasps )

08:01.481 --> 08:04.284
I have $10 going once...

08:04.317 --> 08:06.186
Going twice...

08:06.219 --> 08:08.521
You are promised
to Kelly Kapowski.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.423
Hey, all right.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.227
Slater, l forbid you
to go out with Kelly.

08:14.260 --> 08:17.497
Hey, she bid fair and square.
I guess I have
a date for the dance

08:17.530 --> 08:19.566
and you don't.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.604
That's what you think, buster.

08:24.637 --> 08:27.107
Our next eligible hunk
is one of my favorites.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.242
I bid 25 bucks.

08:29.275 --> 08:31.311
Sold, Mama.

08:34.647 --> 08:37.217
We'll grow to love each other.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.290
Our next participant
needs no introduction.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.359
Zack Morris, come on down.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.329
( loud cheers )

08:49.362 --> 08:52.232
Okay, okay, now do I have $5?

08:52.265 --> 08:55.835
- Baby, you've got 25!
- 30!

08:55.869 --> 08:57.637
I have 30.
Do I hear 35?

08:57.671 --> 08:59.873
- 35!
- 40.

08:59.906 --> 09:03.610
We've got heat at 40.
Do I hear $50? Anyone, $50?

09:03.643 --> 09:06.346
50!

09:06.379 --> 09:09.616
- I bid $75.
- ( crowd oohs )

09:09.649 --> 09:12.552
Wow, $75!

09:12.585 --> 09:15.121
Going once...

09:15.155 --> 09:16.556
Going twice... so...

09:16.589 --> 09:18.625
$100.

09:20.427 --> 09:24.097
$100?

09:24.130 --> 09:26.599
Wow, where do you kids
get your allowances?

09:28.134 --> 09:30.470
$100! Going once...

09:31.271 --> 09:33.306
<i>Going twice...</i>

09:33.340 --> 09:35.909
Zack Morris, you are
promised to Wendy Parks.

09:35.942 --> 09:38.211
All right!

09:48.855 --> 09:52.092
Hi, Brian. Are you as excited
about the dance as I am?

09:52.125 --> 09:53.927
Certainly.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.262
Maybe we can even go out
before the dance.

09:56.296 --> 10:00.233
I don't think so, Lisa.
Face it, we don't have
anything in common.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.903
That's not true. I mean...
We both live in California,

10:03.937 --> 10:05.939
we both attend
the same school,
we're both...

10:05.972 --> 10:08.041
Different.
I don't care about fashion

10:08.074 --> 10:10.076
and you'd be bored by
''Catcher in the Rye.''

10:10.110 --> 10:13.079
No I wouldn't.
I love baseball.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.282
It's not about baseball, Lisa.

10:16.316 --> 10:20.286
You see, it's about...
alienation.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.323
I loved ''Alien Nation.''
It was my favorite TV show.

10:25.091 --> 10:28.094
No, Lisa, um...
I've got to go.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.163
Excuse me.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.936
Zack, hi.
I saved us a table.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.105
- Aww.
- You did?

10:39.139 --> 10:42.175
Yeah, lunch, remember?
We're going to
talk about the dance?

10:42.208 --> 10:44.978
I'll leave you two
lovebirds alone.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.013
( Zack, quietly )
Slater, Slater. Come on.

10:47.047 --> 10:51.451
Zack, I am so
excited about our date,
I haven't been able to eat.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.954
But,
I guess that's good for me.
( giggles )

10:56.456 --> 11:01.061
Look, Wendy...
I really can't
have lunch today.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.129
- What's wrong?
- ( Zack screams )

11:03.163 --> 11:06.299
It's... it's my back. You see,
it's an old track injury.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.069
- I have to go to the doctor.
- You seemed fine earlier.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.237
( groaning ) You never know
when it's going to hit.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.140
- Is there anything I can do?
- You can pray for me.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.380
Slater, l need to know
what you think about me.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.083
You know, the real me,
the person.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.518
Okay. You're pretty,
you're fun at parties,

11:25.552 --> 11:28.355
and you never have bad breath.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.091
Anything else, a bit deeper?

11:31.124 --> 11:35.428
Okay... you're a great dancer.

11:35.462 --> 11:39.199
- That's it?
- Well yeah, l guess so.

11:39.232 --> 11:42.102
Then it's true,
I am an airhead.

11:42.268 --> 11:44.404
Lisa?

11:46.106 --> 11:48.441
Boy, this is definitely
not my day with women.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.147
The new uniforms
have been ordered

11:54.180 --> 11:57.450
with the money raised
at the auction!

11:57.484 --> 12:01.221
Try and make these last,
Miss-Rah-Rah-Sis-Boom-Bleech.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.057
Meeting adjourned.

12:04.090 --> 12:06.292
Jessie is still mad at me.
Let's call the date off.

12:06.326 --> 12:10.163
No way! She started this
and I'm going to
teach her a lesson.

12:11.564 --> 12:15.402
Sorry I'm late.
l was in the library
reading up on Tolstoy.

12:15.435 --> 12:19.539
Or ''Tolstoy'' as it is
often pronounced
in Eastern Europe.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.275
What's with Lisa?

12:22.308 --> 12:25.512
The nail polish fumes
must have gone to her head.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.783
- Hello, Brian.
- Lisa, is that you?

12:29.816 --> 12:32.352
( scoffs ) Of course it's me.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.220
You've really
been reading Tolstoy?

12:34.254 --> 12:36.423
Oh, I just loved
<i>Anna Karenina.</i>

12:36.456 --> 12:40.093
I cried at the end when she
threw herself under the train.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.162
Lisa, I'm impressed.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.198
You inspired me to become
a more serious student.

12:45.231 --> 12:48.601
Really? Let me help you
with those books.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.603
I know a quiet little corner
in the library

12:50.637 --> 12:54.274
- where we can
both read together.
- I hope I'm dressed right...

12:54.307 --> 12:58.311
- I mean,
the library might be chilly.
- You can borrow my sweater.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.184
Hi, Zack.
Feeling better?

13:04.217 --> 13:08.388
Oh, oh, the doctors
all feel with intensive
acupuncture needle therapy,

13:08.421 --> 13:11.324
um... deep tissue massage
and vitamin B shots,

13:11.358 --> 13:13.360
i might recuperate
and live a normal life.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.829
But of course
I won't be able to dance.

13:15.862 --> 13:19.265
I called your house to see
how you were and your mom
said you were surfing.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.568
Ah, uh... well,
l was body surfing.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.436
You see, you have
to lie down to do that.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.272
This is so you don't have to
go to the dance
with me, isn't it?

13:26.306 --> 13:28.341
- No...
- Because I don't
look like Lydia,

13:28.375 --> 13:31.511
- or Kelly, or Elle McPherson.
- Wendy...

13:32.545 --> 13:35.348
I've heard the "I'm sick"
excuses before,

13:35.382 --> 13:37.550
but I thought
you were different.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.553
I'll have more fun
going to the dance by myself.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.423
At least I'll be with someone
who's honest.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.832
Descartes was
my favorite philosopher.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.735
He said,
''I think, therefore I am.''

13:55.769 --> 13:57.937
Well, yes. But l ask,

13:57.971 --> 14:00.874
"If l think not, am l not?"

14:00.907 --> 14:05.045
I think not.
Don't you think?

14:05.045 --> 14:09.816
Lisa, l was wrong about you.
Your brain teasers
are driving me wild.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.052
I've always loved philosophy.

14:12.085 --> 14:15.121
For example,
what is art?

14:15.155 --> 14:18.224
Are we art?
Is art art?

14:19.259 --> 14:22.796
Excuse me, Lisa.
Phone call. It's Art.

14:25.298 --> 14:28.268
- Have you heard
yourself lately?
- Yeah, I'm good, aren't l?

14:28.301 --> 14:31.071
Brian really likes
the new intellectual me.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.239
Brian isn't liking
the real Lisa.

14:33.273 --> 14:36.209
He's liking some fake
phony philosopher.

14:36.242 --> 14:40.080
Yeah, but this phony
has a boyfriend.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.148
The old Lisa didn't.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.857
Zack, you've got to help me.
Screech is driving me crazy.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.293
Yep, you and everyone else.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.095
He thinks he's
in love with me.

14:55.095 --> 14:58.798
He keeps sending bouquets
but no flowers.

14:58.832 --> 15:03.103
And instead of candy,
he brings leftovers from home.

15:03.136 --> 15:06.806
Hello there, my fairest,
tallest, and oh so
long-legged feminist.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.943
- ( growls )
- Help.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.178
I brought you something
to chew on between classes...

15:12.212 --> 15:15.148
Mom's meatloaf. Enjoy.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.954
Ugh, he's such a geek.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.256
What's everyone gonna think
when they see us at the dance?

15:23.289 --> 15:25.291
Come on, Jessie.

15:25.325 --> 15:29.562
Screech may act like a
crash-test dummy, but
underneath he's a great guy.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.865
He's gonna humiliate me
in front of the whole school.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.067
- I've got to get out of this.
- You made a commitment.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.370
You'll break his
dorky little heart
if you back out now.

15:37.404 --> 15:41.274
- I sound stuck up
and awful, don't l?
- You sure do.

15:41.307 --> 15:45.078
You're right, I should give
the little booger a chance.

15:45.078 --> 15:49.883
Wendy's not exactly your type,
but you're going with her.

15:49.916 --> 15:53.086
- Yeah, right.
- Then I'll do it.
Thanks, Zack.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.390
But... you take the meatloaf.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.395
<i>( rock music playing )</i>

16:12.605 --> 16:14.908
What happened
to your date, Herbie?

16:14.941 --> 16:17.410
She told me she suddenly
had to move to Europe.

16:17.444 --> 16:20.313
Mine too,
what a coincidence.

16:20.347 --> 16:23.116
- Yeah.
- Where's your babe, Morris?

16:23.950 --> 16:25.885
She decided not to go with me.

16:25.919 --> 16:28.955
That's not good. You need
to come up with
a better excuse.

16:29.055 --> 16:32.859
Yeah, like,
she joined the space program.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.434
Hey, Wendy, where have
you been? I've been
looking all over for you.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.636
I was at home.
What did you think?

16:43.670 --> 16:47.440
That I suddenly
moved to Europe
or joined the space program?

16:49.676 --> 16:53.246
I'm sorry about what I did,
but I'd like to
dance with you.

16:53.279 --> 16:55.181
- I guess that would be okay.
- All right.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.083
What changed your mind?

16:57.083 --> 16:59.119
I made a commitment to you
and I want to keep it.

16:59.152 --> 17:02.022
- Boy, I sound like Oprah.
- ( giggles )

17:02.055 --> 17:05.025
I just feel guilty
about dumping you.

17:05.025 --> 17:09.396
That's nice, but I don't
want to be your date
because you feel guilty.

17:09.429 --> 17:13.400
Thanks anyway, but I'd rather
hang out by the finger foods.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.174
When they need
their algebra done,
they always come back.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.346
You know,
Lisa, l used to tell people
they could see the sunset

17:26.378 --> 17:30.050
if they looked
through your ears,
but you've changed.

17:30.083 --> 17:33.420
I want you to respect me,
Brian. I only go to
foreign films now,

17:33.453 --> 17:35.955
and yesterday
I started French lessons.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.458
French lessons?
<i>Parlez-vous Francais?</i>

17:38.491 --> 17:41.261
Not yet, but I love
French toast.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.431
It was a joke.

17:44.464 --> 17:48.134
Oh, yes, and a rather
funny one too.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.272
Brian, instead of that
cello concert tomorrow,

17:52.305 --> 17:54.741
I was thinking maybe
we could go to the mall.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.977
The mall? l get it,
you're joking again.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.160
You really miss Jessie,
don't you?

18:14.194 --> 18:16.196
What makes you
say that, Jessie?

18:16.229 --> 18:18.264
You see? You've been
calling me that all night.

18:18.298 --> 18:22.035
We haven't
moved in 20 minutes,
this is a fast dance.

18:27.173 --> 18:30.210
Kelly, you better get ready
to show off the new uniforms.

18:30.243 --> 18:34.347
- Slater,
you gonna be okay alone?
- Sure, Jessie.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.416
He'll be fine.
Come on, Slater,
let's get some punch.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.551
Sure, Mr. Jessie.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.561
That Spano's
one amazing chick.

18:48.595 --> 18:51.498
Really gets my mojo going.

18:51.531 --> 18:55.068
I know,
she's one terrific girl.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.137
You mean you miss her?

18:57.170 --> 18:59.539
I don't want to talk about it,
okay, Screech?

18:59.572 --> 19:02.308
Slater, are you okay?

19:03.476 --> 19:06.579
Hang in there,
you big galoot.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.518
Jessie, get out
on the dance
floor with Slater.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.486
What about us?

19:13.520 --> 19:17.357
Try to forget about me.
You're breaking
his heart, Mama.

19:20.794 --> 19:23.196
Hi there.

19:23.229 --> 19:25.532
Mama's back.

19:29.636 --> 19:33.106
Oh, look it,
Slater and Jessie
are back together.

19:33.139 --> 19:37.444
- Let's go talk to them.
- Talk to that Neanderthal?
Get real.

19:37.477 --> 19:42.349
And Jessie's worse,
what a pseudo-intellectual
neurotic.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.250
Don't you like
any of my friends?

19:44.284 --> 19:46.453
Are you kidding?
Worst of all is Zack.

19:46.486 --> 19:49.189
Even sleep requires
too much thinking for him.

19:49.222 --> 19:52.158
Lisa, l think it's time
you made some new friends.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.194
Excuse me for breathing.

19:54.227 --> 19:58.264
I have had enough of you,
Mr. Too-Much-Attitude.

20:01.468 --> 20:04.137
- What are you doing?
- Being <i>moi</i>.

20:04.170 --> 20:08.341
Here's something I learned
in French class:
<i>Au revoir,</i> creep.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.481
Attention, everyone.
Attention.

20:14.514 --> 20:18.251
Your captain of
the cheerleading squad,
Kelly Kapowski.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.390
This cheer's for you, Bayside.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.525
We needed new uniforms,
you knew we did,

20:25.558 --> 20:27.927
so we banded together
and decided to bid.

20:27.961 --> 20:30.397
They feel so good,
they fit so right.

20:30.430 --> 20:33.533
Thank you, Bayside,
you're outta sight.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.206
All right, kids,
this is the last dance.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.642
Make it memorable.

20:42.676 --> 20:45.545
<i>( Instrumental music playing )</i>

20:58.525 --> 21:01.728
Hey, Wendy.
The dance is almost over,
what do you say?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.730
I thought we went
over this, Zack.
You don't have to...

21:03.763 --> 21:06.366
Give me a break, I want to.

21:15.742 --> 21:19.279
- Mind if I cut in?
- Go ahead, it's all right.

21:19.312 --> 21:22.315
No thanks,
Wendy's my date tonight.

21:22.349 --> 21:26.286
But we'll look for you
later at The Max.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.655
The Max?
You're asking me
out after the dance?

21:28.688 --> 21:31.991
Yeah,
might even have some fun...
if that's okay.

21:32.092 --> 21:34.761
No, fun is good, I like fun.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.430
And I like you.

21:47.607 --> 21:51.478
<i>( Instrumental</i>
<i>theme music playing )</i>
