break up with me,

07:15.226 --> 07:17.387

11:10.420 --> 11:13.332
a fever that originated
in the Nigerian town
of Lassa?

11:13.423 --> 11:15.880
He's been to
three other countries
in the last two years.

11:15.967 --> 11:19.425
Here, Zimbabwe and
Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.
No Lassa there either.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.753
Oh. Again.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.088
Trypanosomiasis?

11:23.183 --> 11:26.346
No sleep disturbances,
but it fits best
with his symptoms

11:26.436 --> 11:28.552
and it's geographically
the most... What?

11:28.646 --> 11:31.137
The Egypt visit was
for the African
Union meeting,

11:31.232 --> 11:34.224
where I'm guessing
he was "meeting"
people from "Africa",

11:34.319 --> 11:35.650
which includes Liberia,

11:35.737 --> 11:37.443
which sent some members
of their foreign ministry

11:37.530 --> 11:40.738
which has itself
just been hit by
an outbreak ofjock itch.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.700
I'll start the ribavirin.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.373
I did say it up front.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.498
It's great to
have the old team
back together again, huh?

12:00.011 --> 12:01.467
Yesterday,
it's poisoning,

12:01.554 --> 12:02.839
today, Lassa fever.

12:02.931 --> 12:04.011
Maybe a specialist...

12:04.098 --> 12:07.135
Joseph, leave him alone.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.806
These people know
what they are doing.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.313
Are you married, doctor?

12:14.400 --> 12:15.480
No.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.899
You have a girlfriend?

12:18.613 --> 12:19.568
Yes.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.489
Judging by your
tentative answer

12:22.575 --> 12:25.988
and the complicated
expression on her face,

12:26.079 --> 12:29.367
I believe that is she
standing in the hallway.

12:35.338 --> 12:38.330
I got a call from
Douglas' department
at Princeton General.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.585
They want me to
interview with them.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.463
Which is weird
because when
I called last week,

12:42.553 --> 12:43.838
they said they had
nothing available,

12:43.930 --> 12:46.592
so I never sent in
my resume.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.514
Douglas owes me a favor.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.057
Most people
send chocolates.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.760
And I'd stand outside
your apartment all night
holding up a boom box

12:52.855 --> 12:55.517
except you told me
you hate '80s music.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.444
So about dinner,
(CLEARING THROAT)
I'm free tomorrow night.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.539
(DOOR CLOSES)

13:28.224 --> 13:32.342
l was wondering
what that noise was.
It's the damn cane.

13:32.437 --> 13:33.552
And I'm Greg.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.353
And I can't sleep
with you banging around
with that thing.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.476
(CHUCKUNG)

13:37.567 --> 13:40.934
You're not actually saying
that l have too loud a cane?

13:41.029 --> 13:43.566
Is that hard for you
to understand?

13:43.656 --> 13:45.521
Well, only in the sense
that it has a rubber tip

13:45.616 --> 13:47.026
on the end,
not a tap shoe.

13:47.118 --> 13:49.655
Now you're
getting cute with me.

13:49.746 --> 13:54.490
Okay, we started badly.
I apologize for the noise

13:54.584 --> 13:56.575
and we will try
to figure out a way
to be quieter.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.206
And a thousand other things
I don't give a crap about.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.915
Now you keep it down
or we're going
to have trouble.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.552
(DOOR OPENS)

14:08.639 --> 14:09.799
Wow.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.218
CAMERON: You paged me?

14:15.313 --> 14:20.558
This is Ama.
She is from our country,
but she lives here now.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.437
We'd like you
to use her blood.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.734
For what?

14:23.821 --> 14:28.110
She recovered
from Lassa fever
two years ago.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.987
Our Health Minister
has advised us

14:30.078 --> 14:33.536
that plasma from one
who has the antibodies

14:33.623 --> 14:35.659
is much more effective
than ribavirin.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.287
NTILA: This is
a signed consent form.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.994
Will you take
her blood, please?

14:44.133 --> 14:45.168
No.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.250
I want to do this.

14:47.345 --> 14:50.178
You understand
that we will be
using your blood

14:50.264 --> 14:52.129
to cure
President Dibala.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.715
I know.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.471
Are you from
the Sitibi people?

14:55.561 --> 14:56.721
lam Sitibi.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.019
Did they threaten you
in some way?

14:58.106 --> 14:59.221
Your family members
back home?

14:59.315 --> 15:02.478
Please let me
give the blood. Please.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.023
Do it.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.400
She's being coerced.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.277
If she is,

15:10.368 --> 15:12.359
I'd rather have
a needle prick
on my conscience

15:41.357 --> 15:44.599
(SHOUTlNG) Hey!
Don't let him in there!

15:44.694 --> 15:46.400

15:55.371 --> 15:56.486

we got him.

Hey.

15:59.876 --> 16:00.991
(GROANING)

16:01.085 --> 16:02.074
You all right?

16:02.170 --> 16:03.956
Who is that man?

16:10.553 --> 16:12.259
He shot him?

16:12.346 --> 16:13.381
No.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.094
You need a lawyer.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.930
You can get
a court-appointed.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.140
I can help you.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.316
I can't be helped.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.736
You did a stupid,
terrible thing.

16:31.574 --> 16:34.862
But given the circumstances
with your wife,

16:34.952 --> 16:36.738
you could get
a reduced sentence.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.572
She wasn't my wife.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.997
Well, who was she?

16:45.087 --> 16:47.749
They never
told us her name.

16:53.012 --> 16:57.096
What his men made us do
to that woman,

16:58.768 --> 17:04.934
he is now going to do
to all the Sitibi.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.312
You could have
gotten killed.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.392
He wasn't
going to hurt me.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.774
He fired a gun
in the hospital.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.735
Come here.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.449
Maybe next time,
don't yell out
that warning.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.998
The bloody eye was from
an enlarged lymph node
blocking the retinal vein.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.458
We restored
circulation,

17:33.553 --> 17:35.214
but it means we've got
to add lymph involvement

17:35.304 --> 17:38.137
to the heart and lungs,
and rising fever.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.390
I'm just going to
sit here quietly.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.058
VVhy?

17:43.145 --> 17:45.887
I feel like I've been
inadvertently undermining
your authority.

17:45.982 --> 17:49.349
So I'm just gonna observe.
I'm not gonna say a word.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.861
The heart could point
to sarcoidosis.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.233
(CLEARING THROAT LOUDLY)

18:00.246 --> 18:05.240
I'm thinking the X-rays
indicate a lack
of hilar adenopathy,

18:05.334 --> 18:06.710
which rules it out.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.210
Staph aureus?

18:11.132 --> 18:12.212
CHASE: No.

18:14.135 --> 18:19.255
Because he smokes?

18:21.517 --> 18:22.802
He's miming
a thermometer.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.509
He says the fever's
not high enough.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.595
So some other infection.

18:27.690 --> 18:28.770
FOREMAN: He's wrong.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.315
The fever could be
misleading us into
thinking infection.

18:31.402 --> 18:32.687
(EXHALES)

18:33.446 --> 18:34.652
Talk.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.367
It could all fit
with lymphoma.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.368
I need you to
spread your legs
so I can do an ”H'.

18:50.463 --> 18:54.797
Can't be lymphoma.
LDH is normal.

18:54.884 --> 18:55.999
He's got good
liver function,

18:56.093 --> 18:58.209
it's masking
the elevated levels.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.841
Biopsy the lymph node.
Check it out.

19:02.558 --> 19:06.176
Makes sense.
Guess you don't need me.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.814
Oh. By the way,
you might want to
close the blinds.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.392
It's really bright
in here.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.781
It's just
a wild coincidence

19:24.872 --> 19:26.487
that he thought
you were a rude jerk.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.913
Come on, give me
the benefit of the doubt.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.865
You said he's a jerk.
I barely talked.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.336
You talked!

19:32.588 --> 19:33.623
(SIGHS)

19:33.714 --> 19:36.421
All I wanted was to
sip morning espresso

19:36.509 --> 19:38.340
next to a peaceful,
burbling fountain.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.169
You could be
sipping Courvoisier

19:41.263 --> 19:43.345
next to a replica
of the Playboy grotto

19:43.432 --> 19:45.218
if you tell him
what you got on him.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.015
I don't have
anything on him.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.263
I don't want
anything on him.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.720
Closest he's been
to Vietnam,

19:50.815 --> 19:54.023
ordering the Mee Krob
at that place on the corner.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.475
Mee Krob is
from Thailand.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.604
Exactly.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.937
What did you do?
Why do you think
he's faking?

19:59.031 --> 20:00.191
I saw his mail.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.362
You broke in?

20:01.450 --> 20:06.570
No. He was holding it.
Private medical insurance,
not from the VA.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.781
Plus he's gotta
be early 50s.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.082
He's too young
to be a vet.
So, I looked further.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.158
You did break in.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.334
Online.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.254
There's no reference to him
in any of the vet records.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.717
Why would he fake
being a veteran?

20:18.801 --> 20:21.042
Well, just look
how you're acting.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.839
Normally, we'd all
tell the amputee
to go screw himself.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.892

Heroes get adulation.
lt's way better.

to help me out

the Vietnam stuff.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.562
I could prove this.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.390
But you won't because
you'll be too busy

20:36.485 --> 20:37.986
writing him
a letter of apology

20:38.070 --> 20:41.403
and dropping it at his door,
without knocking at his door.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.027
I didn't do anything.
That guy's a total ass.

20:44.118 --> 20:47.326
Which is the point.
It's easy to be nice
to people you like,

20:47.413 --> 20:51.406

people you hate,
that's a skill. Do it.

for saving my life.

tried to kill you,

Twenty years ago,
these same Sitibi rebels
took over the south.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.861
They massacred
tens of thousands,

happily do it again.

a genocide. Genocide.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.925

spoken to me in years

21:45.012 --> 21:47.799
because of what he read
in your newspapers.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.972

is not true.

a 12-year-old boy

25:04.795 --> 25:06.706
who stepped
on a land mine.

25:06.797 --> 25:09.459
Thirty-six years later,
every second I feel pain
in my hand

25:09.550 --> 25:11.165
like I'm still grabbing
that boy's arm

25:11.260 --> 25:13.842
even though
my arm isn't there.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.762
So, no, I'm not faking.

25:19.435 --> 25:20.515
Oh.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.893
On a related note,
go Maple Leafs.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.363
Did you get
the biopsy results?

25:38.454 --> 25:39.614
Is it lymphoma?

25:39.747 --> 25:40.736
No.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.696
So we have to move on.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.656
Infection,
perhaps autoimmune...

25:44.752 --> 25:47.789
Did you get
the biopsy results?

25:47.880 --> 25:49.745
Yes, | just told you.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.455
Is it lymphoma?

25:55.763 --> 25:57.549
Cameron and Chase?

25:57.639 --> 25:59.425
They both really
like diagnostics,

25:59.516 --> 26:03.179
and I think they both
really like watching
House torture me.

26:03.270 --> 26:06.603
Anyway, thank you
for understanding
about the job.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.980
I had two really
crappy alternatives.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.279
There was a third.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.571
What's that?

26:17.284 --> 26:19.491
You could have
stepped aside.

26:19.703 --> 26:22.080
(LAUGHING) We both would
have lost ourjobs.

26:22.164 --> 26:24.246
You could have
asked Cameron or Chase
to take your place.

26:24.333 --> 26:25.539
They wouldn't
have wanted to.

26:25.626 --> 26:28.743
You just said
they both really
like diagnostics.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.506
You want to
go back in time?

26:31.590 --> 26:33.581
I want to
make this work.

26:34.676 --> 26:38.669
I want to understand you.
I mean, you know
how you made me feel.

26:40.516 --> 26:42.598
If you could
do it again...

26:44.478 --> 26:46.514
I made the right decision.

26:59.993 --> 27:02.951
I need your confidential
medical opinion.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.871
Is the President capable
of thinking clearly?

27:06.708 --> 27:08.664
Obviously not right now.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.831
Will he ever be?

27:13.674 --> 27:15.039
lthink...

27:16.218 --> 27:19.802
Neurons don't grow back,
and he's already
in his decline.

27:20.722 --> 27:23.213
Anything he tells you,
any command he gives,
how will you ever know

27:23.308 --> 27:27.267
it's notjust
the delusions of a sick,
mad, dying, old man?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.989
(OVER INTERCOM)
He just started
spiking a fever.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.535
It's scleroderma.

27:46.957 --> 27:49.949
You don't have
some clever way
of telling me this time?

27:50.043 --> 27:52.580
Patient's dying.
I'm done with clever.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.504
Look at his skin.
It's tight for
a 75-year-old.

27:55.591 --> 27:58.799
Based on
his admission photo?
Bit subjective.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.376
Fever points
to infection.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.961
And now he's got
nodules on his fingers.
That's blastomycosis.

28:03.056 --> 28:06.765
Nodules? You're calling
tight skin subjective?

28:06.852 --> 28:07.841
I'm with Foreman.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.597
We would have
seen fungus balls
on the head CT.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.098
Fungal lesions
can be missed.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.225
CAMERON: We could
settle this with a test.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.477
Anticentromere antibodies
would point to scleroderma.

28:14.568 --> 28:17.776
Point to, not prove.
And his fever's too high.
We have to treat him now.

28:17.863 --> 28:21.276
If we treat wrong,
we could send this
disease into overdrive.

28:21.366 --> 28:22.867
You're with me on
the scleroderma?

28:22.951 --> 28:24.782
Iguess.
I just don't care enough
about the patient

28:24.912 --> 28:26.618
to waste my time trying
to convince anyone.
We get it.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.821
You don't like the guy,
you don't want to
work on this case.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.247
And yet
you're still here.

28:30.334 --> 28:31.369
Why don't you
take a stand?

28:31.460 --> 28:33.200
Either do something
about it or shut up.

28:33.295 --> 28:35.707
Treat him for blasto
if you want.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.796
I'll get Cuddy.
I can convince her to...

28:38.884 --> 28:40.374
This isn't a democracy.

28:40.469 --> 28:41.879
I don't care who you get.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.677
At least for right now,
this is my department.

28:44.765 --> 28:45.925
We're treating
him for blasto.

28:46.016 --> 28:48.473
Start him
on amphotericin B.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.690
Inject my IV
with an air bubble.

29:00.781 --> 29:01.861
What are you doing?

29:01.949 --> 29:03.405
I will have
another heart attack.

29:03.492 --> 29:04.481
No one will know.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.816
Let her go.

29:05.911 --> 29:10.655
You tell my colonel
I'm a sick, dying old man
who can't be trusted.

29:10.749 --> 29:11.738
I didn't say...

29:11.833 --> 29:13.698
You were trying to
put a gun in his hand

29:13.794 --> 29:17.537
and point it at my head.
The gun is now in your hand.

29:17.631 --> 29:21.044
That is
a practical difference,
not a moral one.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.921
If you want me dead,
then pull the trigger.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.968
It is not so easy
when you have to
do it yourself.

29:42.698 --> 29:43.938
Allison.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.371
I guess I didn't
want you dead.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.458
If you touch
my wife again,

30:05.554 --> 30:07.260
I'll kick your ass
out onto the street.

30:07.347 --> 30:08.553
I don't care
who you are.

30:08.640 --> 30:12.849
I did her a favor.
I showed her
her true character.

30:13.437 --> 30:15.302
She's a better person
than you are.

30:15.397 --> 30:18.059
She is too weak to
act on her beliefs.

30:18.775 --> 30:22.233
But that is not her fault.
Almost everyone is.

30:22.321 --> 30:25.734
Even my own advisers,
my own colonel.

30:26.992 --> 30:32.783
All they do is
negotiate and debate
and sign treaties.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.488
They are appeasers.

30:34.583 --> 30:39.168
All the while,
we are beset by assassins
and traitors, the scum...

30:39.254 --> 30:40.755
Cockroaches?

30:43.759 --> 30:45.624
What are you gonna
do about them?

30:45.719 --> 30:47.710
What is an enemy to you?

30:48.513 --> 30:52.756
Some younger physician
who covets your office?

30:52.851 --> 30:58.346
In my world,
there are dangers
and bloodshed and death,

30:58.440 --> 31:03.525
and that makes you a man.
And men make choices.

31:03.612 --> 31:08.231
And your choice is
to send bands of drunk,
crazed children

31:08.325 --> 31:10.065
to massacre
an entire people?

31:10.160 --> 31:12.993
Don't ask me questions
you don't want to
know the answer to.

31:13.080 --> 31:17.198
I saved your life.
I deserve to know what
you're planning to do.

31:17.292 --> 31:20.784
Whatever it takes to
protect my country.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.713
You broke
into his apartment?

31:33.809 --> 31:35.549
I didn't break in.

31:35.644 --> 31:37.054
(SIGHS)

31:37.145 --> 31:38.885
Iwish I believed you.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.561
I can fix this.

31:40.649 --> 31:42.264
I already did.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.730
He was gonna
press charges,

31:45.821 --> 31:48.437
but I promised him
you'd leave.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.987
You're kicking me out?

31:53.078 --> 31:55.069
I'll explain it
to your psychiatrist,

31:55.163 --> 31:58.826
but, yeah, you gotta
go somewhere else.

32:01.378 --> 32:03.414
House, I know
when things go wrong,

32:03.505 --> 32:05.712
usually you just double down
and get more involved.

32:05.799 --> 32:09.087
But here,
you could go to jail.

32:09.177 --> 32:11.884
And I truly believe

32:11.972 --> 32:14.429
that you've changed
enough to know
this is the right thing.

32:21.690 --> 32:22.930
CAMERON: We need
a blood sample.

32:23.024 --> 32:25.606
We gotta do
the anticentromere
antibody test.

32:25.694 --> 32:28.436
It'll show House is right.
It's scleroderma.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.646
Why are you
doing this now?

32:31.032 --> 32:33.694
Because I didn't
want to kill him.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.948
And you're right.
I have to take a side.

32:37.831 --> 32:40.743
So I'm gonna do
what I can to
keep him alive.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.242
I'll get you the blood.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.497
Positive for
anticentromere antibodies.

32:48.592 --> 32:50.048
We gotta get him
off the anti-fungals

32:50.135 --> 32:51.545
and onto steroids
immediately.

32:51.636 --> 32:52.967
I told you before.

32:53.054 --> 32:55.545
This only points
to scleroderma.
It doesn't prove it.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.176
You're just gonna
ignore the test?

32:57.267 --> 32:59.349
Blasto still fits best.

32:59.436 --> 33:01.017
I know it's not conclusive,
but when you put it

33:01.104 --> 33:02.139
with all
the other evidence...

33:02.230 --> 33:04.562
I've made my decision.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.613
Have you told Thirteen
you were wrong to fire her?

33:13.700 --> 33:16.362
What does that have
to do with anything?

33:16.453 --> 33:18.865
I've worked with
you long enough
to know you're reasonable.

33:18.955 --> 33:22.072
You can usually admit
when you're wrong.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.203
But there's some
deep part of you

33:24.294 --> 33:25.534
that when you find
you're wrong about

33:25.629 --> 33:28.371
the most important
decisions you've made,

33:28.465 --> 33:31.207
you get insecure
and you just retrench.

your relationship
that's your right,

38:59.504 --> 39:02.086
It's a sign-in sheet
from the morgue.

39:02.590 --> 39:06.174
Your signature,
9:45 this morning.

39:06.261 --> 39:08.252
That's right before
you guys ran the test.

39:10.098 --> 39:12.134
What were you
doing there?

39:12.767 --> 39:14.007
Follow-up on
a clinic case.

39:14.102 --> 39:15.342
What case?

39:15.436 --> 39:16.471
You think this is
really important?

39:16.563 --> 39:17.973
One of the patients
in the morgue

39:18.064 --> 39:20.931
was a 70-year-old woman
who had scleroderma.

39:22.235 --> 39:25.523
You and Cameron,
if you took
that woman's blood,

39:25.613 --> 39:27.444
you could have
messed up the test results

39:27.532 --> 39:30.774
so we treated Dibala
for the wrong disease.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.528
Cameron had nothing
to do with it.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.242
You son of a bitch!

39:37.333 --> 39:39.824
He was going to
kill the Sitibi,

39:41.129 --> 39:42.164
every last one of them.

39:42.255 --> 39:44.371
I don't care what
he was gonna do.

39:44.465 --> 39:47.628
He came to us
and put his life
in our hands.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.801
All the good we've done,

39:51.014 --> 39:55.178
every life we've saved,
it would have meant nothing

39:55.268 --> 39:59.056
if we just sent him off
to kill hundreds of
thousands of people.

39:59.147 --> 40:00.728
Look at the news.

40:01.441 --> 40:03.102
The moderates
are taking over.

40:03.192 --> 40:05.524
There's hope
for peace talks.

40:06.863 --> 40:09.775
You tell the world
that I faked this test,

40:10.325 --> 40:14.568
Dibala becomes a martyr.
The massacres begin.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.946
I cover this up,
I become your accomplice.

40:19.042 --> 40:21.658
You think you can
guilt me into that?

40:27.091 --> 40:29.673
If the cops are
going to come for me,

40:30.094 --> 40:31.675
please warn me

40:32.889 --> 40:35.346
so that I can
tell my wife first.

40:44.192 --> 40:45.523
Chase,

40:46.819 --> 40:49.071
you really think
you can kill
another human being

40:49.155 --> 40:51.737
without any consequences
to yourself?

40:57.246 --> 40:58.452
No.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.501
(TELEVISION CHATTERING)

41:06.881 --> 41:08.963
My neighbor called.

41:09.050 --> 41:11.883
He sounded happy.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.299
That's nice.

41:15.390 --> 41:18.974
Even nicer, he's approving
the garden expansion.

41:19.268 --> 41:20.394
Huh.

41:20.937 --> 41:23.053
And even more nicer,

41:23.147 --> 41:25.559
he's not going
to press charges,

41:25.650 --> 41:27.356
evenifyou
don't move out.

41:28.736 --> 41:30.692
What did you do to him?

41:31.531 --> 41:32.896
lwas nice.

41:36.244 --> 41:38.235
You really want
to know?

41:40.123 --> 41:44.537
I think I want to
give you the benefit
of the doubt.

41:47.797 --> 41:50.254
WOMAN ON TV: Alligators’ main
prey is smaller animals

41:50.341 --> 41:53.048
that they can kill and
eat with a single bite.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.629
BOTH: Oh!

41:54.721 --> 41:56.427
HOUSE: (LAUGHING) Oh!
