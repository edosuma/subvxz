00:09.343 --> 00:11.892
And you both did know
the deceased, Sharon Knowles.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.072
There's a reason
we met.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.024
There's something
between us. I can see it.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.643

Wait, wait, wait!

02:41.745 --> 02:43.338
Do you not understand
what just happened?

02:43.413 --> 02:45.006
The only thing that
happened is the gun jammed.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.504
It won't happen again.
No, no, no! This is proof.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.051
Don't you understand?
This is proof.

Proof of what?

see what was above me,

03:15.612 --> 03:16.784

are you talking about?

03:25.539 --> 03:27.086
You really are
a lunatic.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.294
You held that gun
point blank at me and fired,

03:30.877 --> 03:33.380
and yet I'm standing
right here talking to you.

03:33.463 --> 03:34.760
What are the chances?
I don't know.

03:34.840 --> 03:35.966
But shit happens
all the time.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.471
This wasn't chance.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.470
This was an act of God.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.055
And we have been
invited into His circle

03:42.139 --> 03:43.516

03:43.598 --> 03:44.850
You haven't been
invited anywhere.

03:44.933 --> 03:45.934
You forced yourself in.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.860
There's more
to your plan than this.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.938
You're smart enough
to know that this hack alone

03:50.021 --> 03:51.398
isn't gonna kill Evil Corp.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.902
Once they realize
they can't recover the data,

03:54.985 --> 03:56.783
they'll figure out
a way to re-create it,

03:57.696 --> 03:59.243
and that's where
you'll need me.

04:00.657 --> 04:01.783
Don't you
see it yet?

04:02.576 --> 04:03.873
From the first
time we met,

04:03.994 --> 04:05.667
I felt something
between us.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.419
This is what I felt.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.295
An uncanny
connection, a bond.

We are meant
to work together.

fate decides.

Yes.

of their crew?

06:32.350 --> 06:34.444
Nope. No sign
of them.

You know the drill.

a little first

Come on.

Can't complain.

Yeah, well, I told you
she was reliable.

weeks spinning their wheels,

need you to answer some questions.

and lie low.

your honeypot request,

09:12.052 --> 09:14.771

to go any further?

09:36.659 --> 09:40.709
pretty soon you're gonna be the

35:35.884 --> 35:38.603
which in my world
eventually leads to suspicion.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.563
Suspicion because
of the events

35:40.639 --> 35:41.765
you guys created.

35:42.182 --> 35:44.059
I dodged a shootout in China.

35:44.851 --> 35:46.103
That hasn't gone unnoticed.

35:47.020 --> 35:48.363
Why was there a shootout?

35:48.563 --> 35:51.237
Who the fuck knows?
Because your boss is a maniac.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.527
And now,
with this FBI hack,

35:53.610 --> 35:55.988
it's left us in a shitstorm
over Berenstain.

35:56.071 --> 35:57.072
Shit happens.

35:57.447 --> 36:00.451
Today wasn't our best day,
but we took care of it.

36:00.867 --> 36:01.868
<i>“W e“ r?</i>

36:02.744 --> 36:03.745
I took care of it.

36:06.081 --> 36:08.675
Yeah. Right.
I forgot.

36:09.417 --> 36:10.919
You guys don't give
a shit about me.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.640
Make sure this
doesn't happen again.

36:22.639 --> 36:24.016
You fucking weirdo.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.119
Hey, don't mind him.

36:41.324 --> 36:44.123
He's a little snake. You know,
the kind of guy that will...

36:45.120 --> 36:46.542
slice your throat
when you fart.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.672
(GRUNTING)

36:54.629 --> 36:55.630
So...

36:56.881 --> 36:58.303
you want to tell me
what that was all about,

36:58.383 --> 36:59.384
running off like that?

37:03.930 --> 37:07.150
You and I, our stories
aren't that different.

37:08.518 --> 37:10.020
I'm not wanted
for the crime of the century.

37:10.395 --> 37:11.612
I work a little
more subtly.

37:12.188 --> 37:14.156
But we're both married
to our jobs...

37:16.317 --> 37:19.537
Whether by nature
or by choice.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.326
That said...

37:27.328 --> 37:30.502
my boys were
everything to me.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.295
Problem is,
I fucked up.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.014
Took too long
to realize it.

37:39.257 --> 37:43.478
And when my wife left me,
she took 'em.

37:46.514 --> 37:49.267
What happened?
I was lost.

37:49.893 --> 37:51.236
As lost as
you are right now.

37:53.563 --> 37:56.191
And after chopping
a fuckload of wood myself,

37:56.399 --> 37:58.697
I realized I needed them
in my life.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.409
But I knew I had
to have a lot of patience.

38:04.574 --> 38:05.996
And when the time
was right...

38:07.952 --> 38:11.582
I was able to prove to my wife
that I was a good provider,

38:12.791 --> 38:13.838
a good father,

38:14.501 --> 38:15.502
a good man.

38:17.545 --> 38:18.762
Now, tonight,

38:19.547 --> 38:23.017
when I get home, my kids
are gonna run up and hug me.

38:25.595 --> 38:29.350
We're gonna make Jiffy Pop and
watch <i>Big</i> Brother together.

38:35.772 --> 38:37.490
When all is said
and done here,

38:38.024 --> 38:40.402
you'll have your chance
to fix your situation.

38:41.361 --> 38:42.908
And then your wife and son

38:43.822 --> 38:45.324
will come running
up to greet you

38:45.406 --> 38:46.999
at the end
of a long day's work.

38:48.618 --> 38:51.497
My wife has to see me
as someone strong again.

38:53.915 --> 38:56.464
She has to know
I will fix this.

38:59.254 --> 39:01.928
But we have to get
this mission back on track.

39:03.675 --> 39:04.676
And that can't happen

39:04.759 --> 39:06.636
until Elliot and I
are reunited.

39:09.973 --> 39:11.270
Give me a few more weeks,

39:12.183 --> 39:13.400
and I promise...

39:14.602 --> 39:15.649
you'll see him.

39:16.729 --> 39:18.902
(MUSIC PLAYING)

39:36.249 --> 39:38.377
Couldn't close?
Nah, he walked.

39:38.877 --> 39:39.924
What happened?

39:42.297 --> 39:43.298
I'll tell you
what happened.

39:43.756 --> 39:44.882
You couldn't
relate to him.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.389
Take my thermos,
for example.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.558
Yeah, so what? You
don't even have kids.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.640
Point is, people
want a connection.

39:53.641 --> 39:54.688
Makes you
more trustworthy.

39:55.310 --> 39:57.028
You walk around with one of
these, and all of a sudden,

39:57.103 --> 39:59.197
you're that corny guy
who's proud of being a father,

39:59.397 --> 40:00.899
helps them buy
what you're selling.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.827
Yeah. I'm gonna go in
for the night.

40:05.820 --> 40:06.946
Next time,
make the sale.

(LAUGHS)

41:00.333 --> 41:01.505
So how'd it go?

41:02.293 --> 41:03.340
It was cool.

41:03.586 --> 41:06.556
<i>Got to stab up a bunch of
nee-Nan motherfuckers to death.</i>

41:07.048 --> 41:09.176
You know, not that I'm a fan
of murderin' and shit,

41:09.258 --> 41:11.056
'cause I respect life and all,

41:11.135 --> 41:13.012
but when it come
to neo-Nazis...

41:13.596 --> 41:14.643
Well, shit,

41:15.139 --> 41:16.641
not gonna lie,
it was kind of fun.

41:22.689 --> 41:24.282
I mean how'd it go
with Alderson?

41:24.774 --> 41:25.775
Oh.

41:27.860 --> 41:28.907
He got his papers.

41:29.862 --> 41:30.909
Should be out soon.

41:32.532 --> 41:35.661
By the way, get him laid
when he gets out, man.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.710

than a chinchilla's asshole.

41:40.707 --> 41:42.505
(ALARM BLARING)

41:49.674 --> 41:50.675

He's being released.

41:56.431 --> 42:01.153
(EXULTANT MUSIC PLAYING)

42:59.160 --> 43:01.333
It's perfect. He will love it.

43:05.833 --> 43:08.006
Now, I'm giving this
back to you

43:08.503 --> 43:09.504
for safe keeping.

43:11.172 --> 43:13.425
The barrel was
jammed. Squib load.

43:13.674 --> 43:16.143
Next shot would've blown
your hand clean off.

Okay.
Wait.

45:07.246 --> 45:08.919
Tyrell, we discussed this.

to be okay.

47:36.812 --> 47:37.938
You need to sit down.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.442

you shouldn't talk to him.

47:41.692 --> 47:42.818
I Will handle this.

47:43.319 --> 47:44.571
He should be in a hospital.

The conditions here
aren't suitable.

47:48.574 --> 47:50.952
It's--
He's in good hands.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.041
I don't understand.

47:53.788 --> 47:54.880
I don't understand.

He and I were
meant to be a team,

I wasn't real.

He said he didn't see me, but I was
standing right in front of him.

48:05.174 --> 48:06.175
We were talking.

48:07.510 --> 48:10.639
So why would he say
I wasn't real, hmm?

48:11.847 --> 48:14.726
I don't understand.
I just don't understand.

48:15.851 --> 48:17.899
It was almost as if
he were a different person.

He is--
Tyrell.

There's something that I need
to tell you about Elliot.

48:31.826 --> 48:32.827
You're right.

48:33.369 --> 48:35.713
He sometimes can become
a different person.
