WEBVTT

00:02.959 --> 00:03.829
Okay.

00:04.004 --> 00:04.961
How's this?

00:05.135 --> 00:06.876
Looks like a
little angel.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.530
Uh...

00:08.704 --> 00:10.575
Yeah, now that
you mentioned it,

00:10.749 --> 00:12.577
not so big on the whole
up-there look.

00:12.751 --> 00:14.971
Maybe we should try
the brown again.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.370
Okay, then,
let's do this.

00:22.544 --> 00:24.981
Uh, you know what?

00:25.155 --> 00:27.157
It is kind of
blah, huh?

00:27.331 --> 00:28.506
I like the Moroccan one.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.117
Piper, other people
are waiting.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.119
PIPER:
Yeah, well, I've been
waiting for years.

00:32.293 --> 00:34.338
Ever since Wyatt was born,
I wanted a family portrait,

00:34.512 --> 00:36.340
and it was always
one thing or another.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.516
He's going you know what,
and you're going bonkers.

00:38.690 --> 00:39.691
[chuckles]

00:39.865 --> 00:41.519
She exaggerates a little.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.043
PIPER:
Now that I have

00:43.217 --> 00:44.783
everyone here, I'm not
gonna be pressured

00:44.957 --> 00:46.307
into making any hasty decisions.

00:46.481 --> 00:48.309
You know, at this point,
it wouldn't be.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.006
Mm.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.269
Look, can I help it
if I just want it to be perfect?

00:52.443 --> 00:54.793
Piper, it's gonna be perfect
no matter what the backdrop.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.578
You look beautiful.

00:56.752 --> 00:57.535
Okay, then.

00:57.709 --> 00:58.710
Let's do this.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.408
All righty, then.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.236
Here we go.
Happy octopus

01:02.410 --> 01:03.889
Everyone, say cheese.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.246
Guys, this really

01:12.420 --> 01:13.812
isn't a good time.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.075
We wouldn't have come,
but this can't wait.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.598
Neither can this.

01:16.772 --> 01:17.773
It may be too late already.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.079
We've gotten word
of something.

01:19.253 --> 01:20.341
BETA:
Someone has information

01:20.515 --> 01:22.256
which could bring
the sisters to us...

01:22.430 --> 01:24.084
help them to see the
beauty of our way.

01:24.258 --> 01:25.172
LEO:
Really?

01:25.346 --> 01:26.390
That's great. Are you sure?

01:26.564 --> 01:27.739
ALPHA:
Yes.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.480
But she's under attack
by demons,

01:29.654 --> 01:30.960
even as we speak.

01:31.134 --> 01:33.397
You must save her
and bring her home,

01:33.571 --> 01:35.095
so she can share what she knows.

01:35.269 --> 01:36.661
BETA:
She may be
our last best chance

01:36.835 --> 01:38.707
at convincing
the sisters.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.493
This isn't gonna
go over very well.

01:50.327 --> 01:51.763
Good job. Nice
smiles, everyone.

01:51.937 --> 01:53.809
Okay, got it, great.
So, uh, I got to go.

01:53.983 --> 01:55.115
Uh, we get three poses.

01:55.289 --> 01:56.551
LEO:
I know,

01:56.725 --> 01:58.030
but something's come up.

01:58.205 --> 01:58.596
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Are we going to do this

01:58.770 --> 01:59.684
or what?

02:01.817 --> 02:03.079
It's the Elders,
isn't it?

02:03.253 --> 02:04.820
What, we can't have
a grace period?

02:04.994 --> 02:07.866
We can't have a normal family
moment without them jingling?

02:08.040 --> 02:10.086
It's not always gonna
be like this, Piper.

02:10.260 --> 02:11.740
What is it,

02:11.914 --> 02:14.525
like a dog whistle now,
only you can hear it?

02:14.699 --> 02:16.266
You have keys to
the car, right?

02:25.841 --> 02:27.669
Try to see your way
out of this, little traitor!

02:27.843 --> 02:28.931
[chuckles]

02:30.585 --> 02:31.238
[screaming]

02:32.326 --> 02:34.241
[screaming]

02:44.947 --> 02:46.644
This can't be right.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.608
Mm... my hero.

03:07.883 --> 03:11.930

03:55.496 --> 03:57.759
Ooh, I have got
a lump that won't quit

03:57.933 --> 04:00.240
from one of those
little snits.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.980
You sure you can't
heal a demon?

04:02.154 --> 04:03.417
Don't push it, I
saved your life.

04:03.591 --> 04:06.158
Only 'cause the stuffed
shirts made you.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.551
You know, I still
don't understand

04:07.725 --> 04:09.553
why you didn't
just shimmer out.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.251
And miss you
coming to meet me?

04:11.425 --> 04:12.817
That would have been rude.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.602
Plus, I'm eager to make

04:14.776 --> 04:16.908
a deal with your bosses.

04:17.082 --> 04:18.083
So why did

04:18.258 --> 04:19.868
the Elders
send you anyway?

04:20.042 --> 04:22.523
They know we had a thing?

04:22.697 --> 04:24.351
We didn't have a thing.

04:24.525 --> 04:25.874
Mm, trying to put that ugly

04:26.048 --> 04:27.571
past behind you, I get it.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.138
Look, don't waste your
seeing powers on me, okay?

04:29.312 --> 04:30.879
Don't have to be
a seer to know that.

04:31.053 --> 04:32.141
So...

04:32.315 --> 04:34.404
is this where it all happens?

04:35.579 --> 04:37.233
Oh, my God.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.802
Don't tell me, that's...
[gasps]

04:40.976 --> 04:42.456
How about you tell me

04:42.630 --> 04:43.631
why your fellow demons
are trying to kill you.

04:43.805 --> 04:46.024
The Elders didn't tell you?

04:47.374 --> 04:49.550
You know, you're hard to read.

04:49.724 --> 04:50.899
But that's okay.

04:51.073 --> 04:51.943
I like a challenge.

04:52.117 --> 04:53.249
Just answer the question.

04:53.423 --> 04:54.990
I'm selling them out

04:55.164 --> 04:56.905
for bigger and better things,
and they're miffed.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.776
Not that they wouldn't do the
same to me in a New York minute.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.779
All right, well, I've
got to fill Piper in.

05:01.953 --> 05:04.042
Sisters find you up here,
they're gonna kill you.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.522
Oh, no, actually, they won't.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.307
I've seen my death--
no babes involved.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.134
All right, well then,
they'll definitely kill me,

05:09.309 --> 05:11.093
so I need to break it
to them gently.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.225
You... stay here.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.186
Okay.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.188
[chuckles]

05:19.362 --> 05:20.320
[gasps]

05:22.887 --> 05:23.975
Damn!

05:24.149 --> 05:27.239
Don't make any loud noises.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.503
I have a soufflé
in the oven,

05:29.677 --> 05:31.809
and you have done enough
damage for one day.

05:31.983 --> 05:34.159
I'm sorry. I know, it was...

05:34.334 --> 05:35.813
I don't know
what I was expecting.

05:35.987 --> 05:38.120
I don't know why I thought
it would be different.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.601
I don't know why I thought
we could have a normal family

05:40.775 --> 05:42.472
when you're just a blur.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.561
Well, that's a little extreme,
don't you think?

05:44.735 --> 05:46.084
It's not like I'm running
away all the time.

05:46.258 --> 05:47.216
It was once.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.479
No, no, I mean the picture.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.568
Mm-hmm.

05:51.742 --> 05:55.006
In the picture...

05:55.180 --> 05:56.399
you're just a blur.

05:58.575 --> 05:59.707
But you know what?

05:59.881 --> 06:01.143
What the heck?

06:01.317 --> 06:02.753
I'm gonna hang
it anyway.

06:02.927 --> 06:03.885
Better than nothing.

06:05.277 --> 06:06.888
I couldn't say no,
it was important.

06:07.062 --> 06:10.021
Yeah, and so is Paige's
dinner date tonight with Kyle.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.763
So if you're done being errand
boy for the Elders,

06:12.937 --> 06:14.286
can you give
the kids a bath?

06:14.461 --> 06:17.420
Because I need
to finish her dinner.

06:17.594 --> 06:19.553
They want us to
protect a demon.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.772
They want us to do what?

06:21.946 --> 06:23.600
They want us to protect
a demon, just until...

06:23.774 --> 06:25.820
Yes, no, I heard you
the first time.

06:25.994 --> 06:27.604
And the answer is
absolutely not.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.998
This is how things
spiral out of control!

06:34.002 --> 06:36.439
Okay, so I think you should
wear this green top.

06:36.613 --> 06:37.919
It's really cute,

06:38.093 --> 06:39.355
you could wear
it with jeans,

06:39.529 --> 06:40.965
and you'll be comfy,
and he'll be comfy.

06:41.139 --> 06:43.446
I'm dressed,
I'm not changing, go away.

06:43.620 --> 06:44.882
I know, but, honey,
don't you think

06:45.056 --> 06:47.102
that's a little much
for a house date?

06:47.276 --> 06:48.712
I mean, he's gonna
walk in the door

06:48.886 --> 06:50.584
and want to throw you
down on the floor.

06:50.758 --> 06:52.542
Exactly.

06:52.716 --> 06:53.543
All right.

06:53.717 --> 06:54.936
But look at this one.

06:55.110 --> 06:58.156
It's sparkly, it's
soft, it's cashmere.

06:58.330 --> 06:59.375
I already have butterflies

06:59.549 --> 07:01.246
in my stomach, honey.

07:01.421 --> 07:05.120
I just... I don't need Cupid
fluttering around me, also.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.122
You really do
look beautiful.

07:07.296 --> 07:08.558
Here, let me
get this for you.

07:08.732 --> 07:10.212
Thank you.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.301
I cannot believe that I have
hooked up so many couples

07:12.475 --> 07:15.086
in this town, and does
my own sister listen to me?

07:15.260 --> 07:16.436
No.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.263
I took your advice.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.615
I made a home-cooked meal,
even though I can't cook.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.268
Yeah, minor detail.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.315
The point is, you'll be home,
you'll be on your turf,

07:26.489 --> 07:28.099
you don't have to talk
about Avatar stuff.

07:28.273 --> 07:30.928
I hope that's all
that's holding him back.

07:31.102 --> 07:33.365
Oh, honey,
he's a workaholic.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.717
I mean, there's chemistry
between you guys, right?

07:36.891 --> 07:39.459
There is so much chemistry,
I feel like I'm...

07:39.633 --> 07:41.722
Okay, you know what, I don't
need to hear how you feel.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.375
[laughs]

07:43.550 --> 07:45.465
This is gonna work out,

07:45.639 --> 07:48.250
because it's too good
for it not to.

07:48.424 --> 07:49.643
You think so?

07:49.817 --> 07:52.733
Yes, I do.

07:52.907 --> 07:54.778
But just to make sure,
I'd wear the green top.

07:54.952 --> 07:57.172
Enough with
the green shirt!

07:57.346 --> 07:59.043
You're right, he'll love
what you have on.

07:59.217 --> 08:00.436
Paige, demon!

08:00.610 --> 08:02.046
No active power,
do something!

08:02.220 --> 08:03.483
PAIGE:
Mirror!

08:09.184 --> 08:10.968
Is that my bad luck or yours?

08:11.142 --> 08:12.230
Plant!

08:12.404 --> 08:13.841

08:14.015 --> 08:14.929
SEER:
Leo, a little
help, please!

08:16.278 --> 08:18.628
Did she just
call for Leo?

08:18.802 --> 08:21.936
There is a demon in the attic,
and you didn't tell me?

08:22.110 --> 08:23.503
I tried, but you
wouldn't let me.

08:23.677 --> 08:24.504
Oh, sure, blame me.

08:24.678 --> 08:25.635
Good God!

08:27.202 --> 08:27.811
[screams]

08:29.073 --> 08:30.205
[grunts]

08:36.080 --> 08:37.560
PIPER:
What is your problem?

08:37.734 --> 08:39.083
Are you crazy?

08:39.257 --> 08:40.345
Hold your fire--
I brought her here.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.695
We need to
protect her.

08:41.869 --> 08:42.913
She has information
that we need.

08:43.087 --> 08:43.740
PHOEBE:
I don't think so.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.568
Piper, are you okay?

08:46.569 --> 08:47.657
PAIGE:
Okay,

08:47.831 --> 08:49.050
Kyle's coming tonight.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.355
There will be no
demons in this house!

08:50.530 --> 08:51.705
Not any night.

08:51.879 --> 08:54.055
That surly one
is your wife?

08:54.229 --> 08:55.491
Surly?

08:55.665 --> 08:56.579
Do you know her?

08:56.753 --> 08:57.667
Who cares?! Just
blow her up!

08:57.841 --> 08:58.755
You can't.

08:58.929 --> 08:59.539
Watch me.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.366
Fine, kill me.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.455
Who cares if I have enough to
kill all upper-level demons?

09:03.630 --> 09:04.935
LEO:
I really think you
should hear her out.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.894
SEER:
Especially after
hunky guy here

09:07.068 --> 09:09.853
went to all that trouble to
rescue me from those demons.

09:10.027 --> 09:11.420
[chuckles]

09:11.594 --> 09:12.987
So, wait, are you telling me
the Elders are

09:13.161 --> 09:14.292
getting us to save demons
from other demons?

09:14.466 --> 09:15.772
Unbelievable!

09:15.946 --> 09:17.339
LEO:
It's not what
you think.

09:17.513 --> 09:18.688
The demons don't want her
working with us.

09:18.862 --> 09:19.994
We just have
to protect her until...

09:20.168 --> 09:20.951
[doorbell ringing]

09:21.125 --> 09:22.605
Okay,

09:22.779 --> 09:23.563
that's Kyle.

09:23.737 --> 09:24.389
Get upstairs!

09:24.564 --> 09:25.565
Relax, relax.

09:25.739 --> 09:26.653
Everything's gonna be great.

09:26.827 --> 09:28.089
And later,

09:28.263 --> 09:30.004
everything's gonna be
really, really great.

09:30.178 --> 09:31.788
[chuckles]Really?

09:31.962 --> 09:33.181
SEER:
Hey, easy with the goods
there, sister!

09:33.355 --> 09:36.358
Just don't let him
eat the eggplant!

09:36.532 --> 09:37.577
What?

09:37.751 --> 09:39.187
What's wrong
with my eggplant?

09:41.232 --> 09:42.103
Hi.

09:42.277 --> 09:43.670
Hey.

09:43.844 --> 09:46.020
You, uh... you
look beautiful.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.848
Thank you.

09:48.022 --> 09:49.110
You're welcome.

09:49.284 --> 09:50.633
She's a traitor!

09:50.807 --> 09:51.808
The seer must die!

09:51.982 --> 09:53.288
Strike harder!Kill the seer!

09:53.462 --> 09:54.985
[clamoring]

09:55.159 --> 09:56.465
Quiet!

09:57.901 --> 10:00.643
The seer is protected
by the Charmed Ones now.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.993
We'll never get to her
before she sells us out.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.778
We have no choice

10:04.952 --> 10:06.823
but to release Zankou!

10:06.997 --> 10:07.868
No.

10:08.042 --> 10:10.392
Zankou can
never be freed.

10:10.566 --> 10:11.959
She's right.

10:13.047 --> 10:16.180
The Source banished him
for good reasons.

10:16.354 --> 10:17.268
He's too powerful.

10:17.442 --> 10:18.792
He'll control us all!

10:18.966 --> 10:21.621
We need his powers to go
up against the witches.

10:21.795 --> 10:24.101
What the seer tells them
will destroy us all.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.929
She must be stopped
or we'll die.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.062
I say, free Zankou.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.718
[screams]

10:33.197 --> 10:35.199
Or not.

10:37.811 --> 10:42.380
Anyone else afraid to go up
against the Charmed Ones?

10:46.254 --> 10:48.169
So, not only do
you run a school

10:48.343 --> 10:49.779
and battle demons,
you cook, too?

10:49.953 --> 10:51.041
[romantic,
saxophone music plays]

10:51.215 --> 10:54.566
Well, actually, I, uh...

10:54.741 --> 10:57.700
Would you like some eggplant?

10:57.874 --> 10:59.746
Um... actually,
no, I-I can't.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.051
I'm allergic
to eggplant.

11:01.225 --> 11:03.314
Really?

11:03.488 --> 11:05.186
Interesting.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.057
Besides, I'm stuffed, but
it was really great, though.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.885
I can't remember the last
time I had a home-cooked meal.

11:09.059 --> 11:11.932
Well, I'm glad
we put a stop to that.

11:12.106 --> 11:13.411
So,

11:13.585 --> 11:14.935
I like you, you like me.

11:15.109 --> 11:16.240
I really don't see
what the big problem is.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.938
Wow!

11:18.112 --> 11:20.027
You just say whatever pops
into your mind, huh?

11:20.201 --> 11:21.942
And you're avoiding
the question.

11:22.116 --> 11:24.422
Well, I don't really
know how to answer it.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.947
Okay, just...

11:27.121 --> 11:29.645
Why don't you just tell me
what's on your mind?

11:29.819 --> 11:31.952
Okay.

11:33.954 --> 11:36.521
Do you remember
a while ago, I, um...

11:36.696 --> 11:38.523
I told you
I didn't have any secrets?

11:38.698 --> 11:41.831
Please tell me
you're not married.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.267
No, no, no, no,
it's nothing like that.

11:43.441 --> 11:44.921
It's-It's
more like...

11:45.095 --> 11:47.097
Paige, I don't want you
to be disappointed in me.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.928
What if...

11:52.102 --> 11:55.062
I told you,
I did not cook this meal?

11:55.236 --> 11:57.325
[laughs]

11:58.979 --> 12:00.328
You didn't, huh?[laughs]

12:00.502 --> 12:03.940
No. I can't cook.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.725
I talked Piper
into doing it for me.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.291
Do you hate me?

12:07.465 --> 12:09.380
No.

12:11.252 --> 12:13.428
No, I don't.

12:16.431 --> 12:19.042
[doorbell rings]

12:20.609 --> 12:22.742
Don't mind me.
As you were.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.920
I think maybe
we should go upstairs.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.752
Darryl, hey! Now's not

12:32.926 --> 12:34.014
really a good time,

12:34.188 --> 12:36.103
not that I'm not
thrilled to see you.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.495
Listen, um,

12:37.669 --> 12:40.281
I'm here about
Inspector Sheridan, Phoebe,

12:40.455 --> 12:42.370
and what I think
he did to her.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.241
Okay, well,
what's-what's going on?

12:44.415 --> 12:45.721
Did you find her?

12:45.895 --> 12:47.941
No, and when I
confronted Brody on it,

12:48.115 --> 12:50.857
he said that she jumped to
a top secret task force,

12:51.031 --> 12:52.641
and that's why
there was no record.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.121
So, that's it, right?

12:54.295 --> 12:56.732
No. There's always
a record somewhere.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.560
So,

12:58.734 --> 13:00.257
I looked for something that
maybe you could scry with.

13:00.431 --> 13:01.998
And?
Listen, her
apartment,

13:02.172 --> 13:04.000
her records, her files
all have been cleaned out.

13:04.174 --> 13:05.610
It's like it was a
professional job.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.961
Someone does not
want me to find her,

13:08.135 --> 13:11.094
and I think that someone just
went upstairs with your sister.

13:11.268 --> 13:12.704
Forget happy endings.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.576
We can't even have
a happy beginning.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.665
Look...

13:16.839 --> 13:20.712
I found this jammed
behind Sheridan's desk.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.498
I mean, it's a long shot, but,
you know, if she used it...

13:23.672 --> 13:27.458
I'll see what I can do.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.332
Oh, and, um,

13:31.506 --> 13:34.204
can you get me one of those cute
little scrunchie-faced dogs?

13:34.378 --> 13:35.640
[sighs]

13:35.815 --> 13:37.294
A Sharpei, I think
they're called.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.556
Oh.

13:38.730 --> 13:39.949
I always wanted a pet.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.951
Oh, and if you can throw
in a lap pool,

13:42.125 --> 13:43.039
oh, that would be great.

13:43.213 --> 13:44.736
LEO:
You know,

13:44.911 --> 13:46.303
you might want to narrow it down
to your top ten demands.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.523
Hey, I've got something
you want,

13:48.697 --> 13:49.829
okay?

13:50.003 --> 13:51.439
And the minute
I spill my guts,

13:51.613 --> 13:53.093
I have no more bargaining chips.

13:53.267 --> 13:56.052
So, I'm milking it
for all I can.

13:56.226 --> 13:57.401
PIPER:
Were the boys

13:57.575 --> 13:59.229
okay when you left?LEO:
Yes.

13:59.403 --> 14:00.709
Miss Donovan was reading
to them.

14:00.883 --> 14:01.884
Did you get the Sharpei down?

14:02.058 --> 14:03.712
You know, 'cause

14:03.886 --> 14:05.409
Chris has that
rash, and

14:05.583 --> 14:07.150
Wyatt's been a little cranky.

14:07.324 --> 14:08.978
They're fine. I don't know
why you worry so much.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.197
We leave them there
all the time.

14:10.371 --> 14:11.807
Exactly, they spend more time

14:11.981 --> 14:13.287
at Magic School lately
than they do at home.

14:13.461 --> 14:14.375
She's right, you know.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.420
Youstay out of it.

14:16.594 --> 14:19.032
Look, I don't want to leave them
there any more than you do,

14:19.206 --> 14:21.077
but we need to take care of this
before the demons attack.

14:21.251 --> 14:24.602
On that note, let's
move this along, shall we?

14:24.776 --> 14:26.430
PIPER:
See, it's
just endless.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.432
I'm never gonna be able to spend
any real time with my kids

14:28.606 --> 14:30.521
while we're
single-handedly

14:30.695 --> 14:32.001
trying to rid the world
of demons.

14:32.175 --> 14:33.220
Hello?

14:33.394 --> 14:35.352
I'm a demon you can get rid of.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.441
Preferably, before
I'm ambushed again.

14:37.615 --> 14:38.878
Okay, here's her list.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.228
Go see what the
Elders have to say.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.882
Hold on there, sugar.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.884
I've got one more thing
I'd like to add to that list,

14:45.058 --> 14:47.930
and it's something
only the Elders can give,

14:48.104 --> 14:49.627
and it's a deal-breaker.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.762
I want to be made human.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.590
What?

14:55.764 --> 14:57.766
Why in the hell

14:57.940 --> 15:00.073
would a powerful demon want
to be made human?

15:00.247 --> 15:01.857
Hell being the operative word,

15:02.031 --> 15:04.468
as in I lived there,
and it sucks.

15:04.642 --> 15:05.948
PIPER:
You know,
I don't think

15:06.122 --> 15:07.254
you know anything.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.386
I think it's all
just one big scam.

15:10.474 --> 15:11.867
How do we have any proof?

15:12.694 --> 15:14.565
Hello, beautiful!

15:14.739 --> 15:15.740
[screaming]

15:17.307 --> 15:18.395
[screams]

15:18.569 --> 15:19.527
Ow!

15:21.442 --> 15:23.096
[screaming]

15:23.270 --> 15:24.924
I can't believe
I slept with that guy!

15:25.968 --> 15:27.578
PIPER:
Okay, apparently,

15:27.752 --> 15:29.406
the cage is not working so great
for you, so just stay down.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.627
How's it going in there?

15:32.801 --> 15:34.934
I'm not letting a
demon interrupt us.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.239
[demons groaning]

15:36.413 --> 15:37.675
[explosive thudding]

15:37.849 --> 15:39.939
[groaning and screaming]

15:40.896 --> 15:42.506
[screaming]

15:43.725 --> 15:45.031
[sighs]

15:45.205 --> 15:46.641
That proof enough
for you, sweetie?

15:46.815 --> 15:48.817
[sighs]

15:54.431 --> 15:57.304
Well, I guess
Chris won't be using this.

15:57.478 --> 16:00.437
I got to stop trying to keep
anything nice in this house.

16:00.611 --> 16:01.612
Oh. Ouch!

16:01.786 --> 16:03.179
You know,
that hurts.

16:03.353 --> 16:04.441
PIPER:
Yeah, well,
get used to it,

16:04.615 --> 16:06.052
'cause if this is a setup...

16:06.226 --> 16:07.749
This is not a setup.[sighs]

16:07.923 --> 16:09.272
Can someone please

16:09.446 --> 16:11.100
just remind me why, uh,

16:11.274 --> 16:13.276
we are protecting
a demon?

16:13.450 --> 16:15.191
PIPER:
Well, apparently,
she's selling out all

16:15.365 --> 16:17.715
of her buddies, so we're doing
the witness protection thing.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.239
You know,

16:19.413 --> 16:20.544
if you want us
to make a deal

16:20.718 --> 16:21.937
with the Elders
to make you human,

16:22.111 --> 16:23.417
I think you need
to give us something.

16:23.591 --> 16:24.505
PAIGE:
Wait.

16:24.679 --> 16:25.636
Back up!

16:25.810 --> 16:26.768
Did you say human?

16:27.725 --> 16:28.900
SEER:
I know,
I know.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.902
I wouldn't actually
have a soul, but

16:31.077 --> 16:32.426
I could live with that.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.731
PHOEBE:
This is

16:33.905 --> 16:35.081
so weird.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.952
Okay, and also
a waste of my time,

16:37.126 --> 16:39.085
because I was in the middle
of something.

16:39.259 --> 16:40.521
Okay, okay, fine.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.045
I'll give you something,
a little enticement.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.612
Baited breath.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.657
Okay, sure,
I have a little black

16:46.831 --> 16:48.094
book of demons, but

16:48.268 --> 16:49.617
I also have
the skinny

16:49.791 --> 16:52.402
on a little thing called...
the Avatars?

16:55.101 --> 16:56.102
What do you know
about the Avatars?

16:56.276 --> 16:57.320
BRODY:
Yeah.

16:57.494 --> 16:58.669
What doyou know
about them?

16:59.931 --> 17:01.281
SEER:
Oh.

17:01.455 --> 17:02.499
Didn't I tell you
he'd like the dress?

17:02.673 --> 17:03.935
Stop doing that.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.242
Could we get back
to the Avatars, please?

17:06.416 --> 17:08.375
I know that they're close.

17:09.463 --> 17:10.855
Closer than
you think.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.771
Could be here any minute.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.602
Uh, Kyle!

17:20.517 --> 17:21.779
Okay, powwow, powwow.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.305
Let's go.

17:26.523 --> 17:27.698
Not you.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.352
You stay here.

17:29.526 --> 17:30.832
PHOEBE:
Okay.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.138
Here's what
I don't get.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.096
Why does the seer
want to be human

17:34.270 --> 17:35.619
if the Avatars
are so close?

17:35.793 --> 17:37.578
Yeah, you'd think
she'd want to be evil

17:37.752 --> 17:39.232
if evil was about
to take over.

17:39.406 --> 17:40.929
Unless the Avatars are good.Yeah, right.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.365
Is that possible?

17:42.539 --> 17:44.019
PIPER:
Either way,
I just need her gone,

17:44.193 --> 17:45.455
and I want my boys home,

17:45.629 --> 17:47.022
so why don't you go up
to the Elders

17:47.196 --> 17:48.632
and see if you can make a deal?

17:48.806 --> 17:50.678
Meantime, I'll
stay with the seer.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.810
Since we have similar
powers, maybe I can
tap into hers

17:52.984 --> 17:54.551
and find out what
she really knows.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.075
Good. Go.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.818
[sighs]

18:02.385 --> 18:05.171
You've put me
in an awkward position.

18:07.260 --> 18:10.089
Why didn't you tell me
I was rescuing a demon?

18:10.263 --> 18:12.221
There wasn't time.
She was about to be killed.

18:12.395 --> 18:13.440
Besides, we couldn't
take the chance

18:13.614 --> 18:14.528
that you would say no.

18:14.702 --> 18:15.920
Too much is at stake.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.052
You're taking
an even bigger risk

18:17.226 --> 18:18.619
by parking a demon in the house.

18:18.793 --> 18:19.924
ALPHA:
We know it's
dangerous, Leo,

18:20.099 --> 18:21.839
but we're at a crossroads.

18:22.013 --> 18:23.711
GAMMA:
Agent Brody is a threat
we didn't count on.

18:23.885 --> 18:25.365
He has the means
to destroy us,

18:25.539 --> 18:27.280
and the passion
to turn them against us.

18:27.454 --> 18:28.542
We're taking
a calculated risk

18:28.716 --> 18:30.239
in the hopes
of guiding the sisters

18:30.413 --> 18:31.414
toward the right road.

18:31.588 --> 18:32.937
This isn't calculated.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.200
It's foolhardy.

18:34.374 --> 18:35.592
The seer is unpredictable.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.377
She'd out me in a heartbeat.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.205
Except she thinks
you're just an Elder,

18:39.379 --> 18:41.032
since she sent her
message to them.

18:41.207 --> 18:41.946
We simply
intercepted it.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.297
She'll see through me.

18:44.471 --> 18:46.734
She won't if you get her
what she wants quickly.

18:46.908 --> 18:47.778
Make the deal.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.563
Think about it, Leo.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.217
With her power,

18:51.391 --> 18:53.610
she can literally
show the sisters our future.

18:53.784 --> 18:56.352
Help them to understand
what we're offering

18:56.526 --> 18:58.137
in a way no
one else can.

18:58.311 --> 18:59.442
Not even you.

19:02.358 --> 19:03.620
They should be back
by now.

19:03.794 --> 19:04.795
They're dead.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.710
The witches
killed them.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.321
Yeah, well,
we'll all be dead soon

19:08.495 --> 19:10.279
if we don't pull out
all the stops.

19:10.453 --> 19:13.804
And what stops are you
pulling out, Shapeshifter?

19:13.978 --> 19:15.632
Yeah, right.
[laughs]

19:15.806 --> 19:17.939
You're a coward
with no power.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.549
I'm just saying...

19:19.723 --> 19:21.508
I'm telling you,
we should release Zankou.

19:21.682 --> 19:23.118
No way.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.910
You know, you girls really
should take better care

19:33.084 --> 19:34.303
of your things.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.131
There are some
singed pages here.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.089
Well, you should tell
your demon friends

19:38.264 --> 19:40.440
to be more careful
when they attack next.

19:40.614 --> 19:42.137
Look at this.

19:42.311 --> 19:43.878
You're like a family,
and there's,

19:44.052 --> 19:47.142
like, pictures of fun
times and stuff.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.493
Look at Wyatt.
[laughs]

19:50.667 --> 19:51.712
That's his first birthday.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.409
Oh.

19:53.583 --> 19:54.889
Are those my earrings?

19:55.063 --> 19:56.412
Yeah. Sorry.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.109
They called out to me.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.808
You're so close,

20:00.982 --> 20:03.593
and-and-and you
like each other,

20:03.767 --> 20:04.812
and you're happy,

20:04.986 --> 20:06.074
and...

20:06.248 --> 20:07.989
Happy and?

20:08.163 --> 20:09.991
And could you push a little
harder on that right shoulder?

20:10.165 --> 20:11.688
If you're not gonna
get a premonition,

20:11.862 --> 20:13.603
you could at least
work out that knot.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.779
Can't blame a girl
for trying, you know.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.520
[laughs]

20:17.694 --> 20:19.435
Hey, when I first started
getting my visions,

20:19.609 --> 20:20.915
I had to touch
people, too.

20:21.089 --> 20:21.829
Phone.

20:22.003 --> 20:22.830
Hmm?

20:23.004 --> 20:23.831
Phone.[phone ringing]

20:24.005 --> 20:25.224
Oh! Oh...

20:25.398 --> 20:26.747
You're good.

20:26.921 --> 20:28.096
[beep]

20:28.270 --> 20:29.837
Hello?

20:30.011 --> 20:31.752
Uh, Darryl, now is not
really a good time again.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.884
Let me call you back?

20:34.058 --> 20:35.059
All right.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.018
[beep]
Hmm.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.586
I mean, not that I'm okay
with you stealing my stuff,

20:39.760 --> 20:43.329
but those earrings
really do look amazing on you.

20:43.503 --> 20:45.766
Then again, what wouldn't?

20:45.940 --> 20:47.855
You know, sugar,

20:48.029 --> 20:49.944
much as I enjoy the flattery

20:50.118 --> 20:52.947
and the bonding and
even the touching,

20:53.121 --> 20:54.427
you're not getting
anything out of me

20:54.601 --> 20:55.906
until you make me human.

20:56.907 --> 20:58.735
Okay.

20:58.909 --> 20:59.910
I get it.

21:00.084 --> 21:01.651
But what I don't get

21:01.825 --> 21:03.871
is why you want to be human.

21:04.045 --> 21:05.394
I mean, did the bad stuff
just start

21:05.568 --> 21:06.526
to get to you after a while?

21:06.700 --> 21:08.528
No.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.181
The good stuff did.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.183
In my line of
work, I see a lot.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.142
Good and bad and...

21:14.316 --> 21:16.492
the good's
just better.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.015
The problem is,

21:18.189 --> 21:20.322
I can see it, but
I can't feel it.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.281
That's the thing about vision:

21:22.455 --> 21:23.847
it's a blessing and a curse.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.545
Yep. You know,
being a demon

21:25.719 --> 21:29.157
is about feeding
the endless emptiness and...

21:29.331 --> 21:30.158
[sighs]

21:30.332 --> 21:31.377
I'm sick of it.

21:31.551 --> 21:33.466
I long for

21:33.640 --> 21:37.296
the... the subtle notes
in between.

21:37.470 --> 21:40.037
And the Avatars have something
to do with that, right?

21:40.211 --> 21:41.691
I'm just not sure what.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.347
Right. Bargaining chip.

21:45.521 --> 21:46.914
Look, it's not
like I'm being

21:47.088 --> 21:48.829
tight-lipped and mean
for no reason.

21:49.003 --> 21:52.136
I can't give you what you want
or I won't get what I want.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.270
I see.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.620
You're not even sure
I have anything you want.

21:57.794 --> 22:00.667
Look, I want to trust you--

22:00.841 --> 22:02.756
I really do--

22:02.930 --> 22:04.932
but you're a demon.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.239
How about I help you
with your other problem

22:08.414 --> 22:09.980
instead? You know,

22:10.154 --> 22:11.242
the thing with the cop?

22:11.417 --> 22:12.766
Uh, Sheridan.

22:13.941 --> 22:15.508
If I find her for you,

22:15.682 --> 22:17.510
then would you trust me?

22:25.953 --> 22:27.520
PAIGE:
What the hell are you doing?

22:27.694 --> 22:29.435
We're wasting time.

22:29.609 --> 22:30.610
We should have orbed in.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.438
Well, yeah,
that's why I drove,

22:32.612 --> 22:33.569
thinking maybe it
would give you time

22:33.743 --> 22:35.266
to chill out a little.

22:35.441 --> 22:38.182
If the Avatars are on their way
like the seer says,

22:38.357 --> 22:40.184
we've got to be prepared.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.665
Okay, what the hell
is that? You're kind
of freaking me out.

22:42.839 --> 22:44.928
That's why the Avatars
killed my parents.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.583
It's a vanquishing
potion that kills them.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.542
I didn't know one existed.

22:49.716 --> 22:51.413
Neither did they.
They didn't even know
what they found.

22:51.587 --> 22:52.849
All they knew
was that this

22:53.023 --> 22:54.416
ancient civilization
fought off

22:54.590 --> 22:56.200
this great power with it.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.508
The Avatars went
in retreat till now.

22:59.682 --> 23:01.858
Well, I think that's great.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.425
Now you have the potion,

23:03.599 --> 23:05.122
we know where it is and uh...

23:05.296 --> 23:07.821
we can just put it away
and bring it out if we need it.

23:07.995 --> 23:09.692
Paige, I have spent
my entire life

23:09.866 --> 23:11.215
preparing for this moment.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.043
When I could finally
meet them face-to-face.

23:13.217 --> 23:17.091
Look, you have to let
my sisters and I help.

23:17.265 --> 23:18.353
This is what we do.

23:18.527 --> 23:22.836
I know you've had
a lot of pain.

23:23.010 --> 23:26.405
Okay, one potion

23:26.579 --> 23:28.407
is not gonna
fix everything.

23:30.191 --> 23:31.671
Would you please
just let us help you?

23:31.845 --> 23:33.542
No, this is my fight.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.805
You don't know what I've
had to do to get this far.

23:35.979 --> 23:37.459
What do you mean?

23:37.633 --> 23:39.592
I told you.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.770
I've done some things that
I'm not very proud of.

23:46.337 --> 23:47.469
We all have.

23:56.870 --> 23:58.654
ODIN:  We don't negotiate with demons.

23:58.828 --> 24:00.090
Well, she could give us
everything we need

24:00.264 --> 24:01.918
to go after every
upper-level demon.

24:02.092 --> 24:03.485
In exchange
for making her human?

24:03.659 --> 24:04.573
I don't think so.

24:04.747 --> 24:06.401
We have more pressing

24:06.575 --> 24:07.837
concerns than demons.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.578
Like the Avatars.

24:09.752 --> 24:11.275
She might know something
about them, too.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.974
What does she know?She's cagey,

24:14.148 --> 24:15.584
but I get the feeling
that she might have

24:15.758 --> 24:17.194
foreseen something about them.

24:17.368 --> 24:20.110
Well... then that might
be worth bargaining for.

24:20.284 --> 24:22.591
But we need to know
what she knows first.

24:22.765 --> 24:23.853
Then and only
then will we see

24:24.027 --> 24:25.289
about giving her
what she wants.

24:33.950 --> 24:35.996
Darryl.
You're late.

24:37.693 --> 24:38.955
Who is this?

24:39.129 --> 24:41.218
Uh, the seer.
Seer, Darryl.

24:41.392 --> 24:42.742
Darryl, Seer.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.657
Let's see if
Sheridan's here, shall we?

24:44.831 --> 24:45.919
Whoa, whoa.

24:46.093 --> 24:47.834
Whoa, hold on
a second here.

24:48.008 --> 24:49.749
You really think
after all this time,

24:49.923 --> 24:51.359
I wouldn't
recognize a demon?

24:51.533 --> 24:52.882
I can't believe you
brought a demon.

24:53.056 --> 24:54.667
Actually she brought me.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.190
Go easy on him,
his wife's had him

24:56.364 --> 24:57.800
sleeping
on the couch all week.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.542
How does she
know that?

25:00.716 --> 25:03.502
Seer, get it?
She sees things.

25:03.676 --> 25:05.025
She's perfectly harmless

25:05.199 --> 25:06.287
and actually very good
at what she does.

25:06.461 --> 25:07.854
I can't hold
a candle to her.

25:08.028 --> 25:09.464
Oh, that's so sweet.

25:09.638 --> 25:12.119
And so not true.
And don't worry,

25:12.293 --> 25:14.034
she'll get over it;
just bring her some

25:14.208 --> 25:15.992
of that marzipan
that she likes.

25:16.166 --> 25:19.039
You're thinking--
you mean, like the
little fruit...

25:19.213 --> 25:21.824
I can't believe I'm
listening to a demon.

25:21.998 --> 25:23.173
Don't be rude.

25:23.347 --> 25:24.218
She found this place.
Let's go.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.527
Ooh, I was thinking
that this crazy ass stuff

25:28.701 --> 25:30.833
wouldn't happen any more
like... like this.

25:31.007 --> 25:32.269
I know, that's why
you don't hang out

25:32.443 --> 25:33.575
with us any more,
but you got to admit it...

25:33.749 --> 25:35.577
you sort of miss it,
don't ya?

25:35.751 --> 25:38.188
Phoebe.

25:38.362 --> 25:39.799
What is your demon
friend doing?

25:41.017 --> 25:42.802
Oh, oh, okay.

25:42.976 --> 25:45.065
There's plenty of time
for this when you're human.

25:45.239 --> 25:47.371
Oh, come on, take
off your shoes.
Let me feel

25:47.546 --> 25:49.199
the grass through you.Yeah.

25:49.373 --> 25:50.766
We gotta get back
before Leo does;

25:50.940 --> 25:51.985
otherwise, he'll flip.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.164
You coming, Darryl?

26:02.561 --> 26:04.519
What kind of place is this?

26:04.693 --> 26:07.000
It's a mental
hospital.

26:07.174 --> 26:09.916
Oh, well, I've never
seen this side

26:10.090 --> 26:11.657
of good in my
visions before.

26:11.831 --> 26:15.008
It's so... bad.

26:15.182 --> 26:17.271
Yeah. Well, there's
a down side

26:17.445 --> 26:19.665
to being able to feel
things sometimes.

26:19.839 --> 26:22.624
Well, I'd still take good

26:22.798 --> 26:25.540
that's not always good,
over bad that's never good.

26:25.714 --> 26:28.021
Somehow I know exactly
what you mean.

26:28.195 --> 26:30.153
I'd try that one.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.820
There's more.

26:51.174 --> 26:52.611
It's Sheridan.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.136
Oh, my God.I told you Brody

26:56.310 --> 26:57.616
did something to her.

27:00.270 --> 27:01.445
[dial tone]

27:01.620 --> 27:02.664
Paige, please
pick up the phone.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.275
Pick up the phone.

27:05.449 --> 27:07.451
[phone vibrates]

27:14.807 --> 27:17.287
Leo, we need to get
Paige away from Kyle

27:17.461 --> 27:19.376
before she ends up
in a coma, too.

27:19.550 --> 27:21.291
You know, I just can't
get over the fact

27:21.465 --> 27:23.206
that you were crazy
enough to take the seer
out of the house.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.773
Well, I needed
to find out if she was

27:24.947 --> 27:26.166
dating a madman, and I did,

27:26.340 --> 27:27.646
and she is.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.473
So, please, Leo, you
need to go get her.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.561
You know, you could have waited
for me and I could've taken her.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.651
I came back, didn't I?

27:32.825 --> 27:33.956
Because you need us.

27:34.130 --> 27:36.393
No, and because
she likes us.

27:36.567 --> 27:39.179
Okay, are you two buddy-buddies

27:39.353 --> 27:40.354
starting to read each other?

27:41.834 --> 27:43.531
What are you
afraid of anyway?

27:43.705 --> 27:45.272
That I'm gonna tell her
your dirty little secret?

27:45.446 --> 27:47.622
Hmm?
What makes you think
I have any secrets?

27:48.841 --> 27:49.972
Hey, guys, Paige

27:50.146 --> 27:51.408
is in danger. We
have to get Piper

27:51.582 --> 27:52.845
out of Magic School,
so we can get Paige

27:53.019 --> 27:54.934
out of Kyle's apartment,
please. Please.

27:55.108 --> 27:57.110
Okay, but don't go anywhere.

27:57.284 --> 27:58.328
And make sure these potions
are near you.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.330
Okay, she's no
good to us dead.

28:00.504 --> 28:01.984
Don't make me come back
and separate you.

28:04.770 --> 28:05.945
So, okay,

28:06.119 --> 28:08.034
if the Avatars are bad,

28:08.208 --> 28:11.341
wouldn't it be safer for you
just to stay a demon?

28:11.515 --> 28:12.778
You're wondering
if hubby

28:12.952 --> 28:15.171
is wrong about
the Avatars?
Yeah.

28:15.345 --> 28:16.912
I mean, is it possible
that they're good?

28:17.086 --> 28:18.479
Is it really possible?

28:18.653 --> 28:20.176
It's a smart question.

28:20.350 --> 28:21.787
One I am sure to
answer for you

28:21.961 --> 28:24.703
once I get my lap pool
and the ability to feel.

28:24.877 --> 28:27.357
Fine, but first
you're gonna have to ID

28:27.531 --> 28:29.142
some of your demon
buddies for me.

28:32.536 --> 28:34.843
We could be making
a huge mistake here.

28:35.017 --> 28:37.150
We don't
have a choice.

28:40.196 --> 28:42.155
[buzzing]

28:54.907 --> 28:57.910
Lexonaro bestia.

28:58.084 --> 28:59.868
Lexonaro.

29:03.393 --> 29:06.396
[buzzing]

29:12.968 --> 29:14.274
[sighing]:
Finally.

29:16.232 --> 29:19.192
Too bad the Source
isn't still alive.

29:19.366 --> 29:20.715
I owe him for this.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.283
One of you was
against freeing me.

29:24.371 --> 29:26.329
Who was it?

29:28.767 --> 29:29.768
It was me.

29:29.942 --> 29:31.117
I figured the Source

29:31.291 --> 29:32.553
incarcerated you
for a reason.

29:32.727 --> 29:34.685
Because you're too dangerous.

29:38.994 --> 29:40.430
I like an honest demon.

29:41.736 --> 29:42.781
Now where's the seer?

29:42.955 --> 29:44.870
You know
about the...

29:45.044 --> 29:47.829
I could sense it
all from my prison.

29:48.003 --> 29:49.526
I even know
about the Avatars.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.660
The demonic forces
await your word.

29:52.834 --> 29:56.272
A legion won't get
past the Charmed Ones,

29:56.446 --> 29:57.665
but a Shapeshifter might.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.841
I'm a Shapeshifter.

30:00.015 --> 30:01.495
Good. Good.

30:01.669 --> 30:03.497
[chuckles]:
Good.

30:03.671 --> 30:05.064
Hah!

30:08.110 --> 30:10.591
Now I'm one, too.

30:14.334 --> 30:15.335
Piper,

30:15.509 --> 30:18.773
Leo... come in.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.604
Hey guys, what's up?

30:23.778 --> 30:26.694
Mm, so much for breaking it
to her before it's too late.

30:26.868 --> 30:28.043
Uh,

30:28.217 --> 30:30.654
what's up is, uh, that

30:30.829 --> 30:33.092
you know how Morris
was looking into

30:33.266 --> 30:34.180
how maybe Sheridan...

30:34.354 --> 30:36.486
tell him Leo.

30:36.660 --> 30:39.054
Phoebe and Morris found Sheridan
in a mental institution.

30:39.228 --> 30:40.751
She was in a coma.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.318
And we believe
you put her there.

30:44.930 --> 30:48.324
Yeah, I actually know.
Kyle told me.

30:48.498 --> 30:49.456
You know?

30:50.544 --> 30:51.675
And you're okay with this?

30:52.894 --> 30:54.374
Well, um...

30:54.548 --> 30:56.724
we all do things
we're not proud of sometimes.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.247
Right, Leo?
I think

30:58.421 --> 31:00.119
that was a little different.
He shot an innocent.

31:00.293 --> 31:02.425
With a tranq dart.

31:02.599 --> 31:03.644
That put her in a coma.

31:03.818 --> 31:05.167
He did that
to help,

31:05.341 --> 31:06.603
to help us.
She was going to expose us.

31:06.777 --> 31:08.040
Look guys, it's just
temporary, okay?

31:08.214 --> 31:09.432
She's completely safe.

31:09.606 --> 31:10.999
And I will bring
her out of it,

31:11.173 --> 31:12.522
right after the Avatar
threat's over with.

31:12.696 --> 31:14.350
After losing
a chunk of her life?

31:14.524 --> 31:16.570
You, of all people, should
understand the sacrifice.

31:16.744 --> 31:18.441
Whatever he's done
is to try to

31:18.615 --> 31:20.095
help rid the
world of evil.
It appears

31:20.269 --> 31:21.618
to me that he's the
evil, not the

31:21.792 --> 31:22.881
Avatars.What, are you

31:23.055 --> 31:23.882
insane?

31:24.056 --> 31:25.013
Of course
they're evil.

31:25.187 --> 31:26.275
Leo, they killed my parents.

31:26.449 --> 31:27.711
PIPER:
Okay,

31:27.886 --> 31:29.452
uh, this is going
to take a while

31:29.626 --> 31:30.758
to figure out. Why
don't you get dressed

31:30.932 --> 31:32.412
so we can go.

31:32.586 --> 31:33.848
I'm not going to go, Piper,
I'm staying here.

31:42.726 --> 31:45.512
That went swimmingly.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.906
Okay, Furies... toxic.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.604
Emphasis on
'ic'. Hate me.

31:50.778 --> 31:52.911
Oh, The Grimlocks,
emphasis on the 'grim'.

31:53.085 --> 31:54.086
Hate me.

31:54.260 --> 31:55.739
Okay, so what I'm gathering

31:55.914 --> 31:58.351
is pretty much every demon
in this book hates you?

31:58.525 --> 31:59.787
Pretty much,

31:59.961 --> 32:01.484
which is sad because
they're my family.

32:01.658 --> 32:05.184
Well, I mean it would
be sad if I had feelings.

32:05.358 --> 32:06.750
Well, don't worry,

32:06.925 --> 32:08.491
I'm going to put something
in the spell about that.

32:08.665 --> 32:10.667
Thanks.

32:10.841 --> 32:12.974
You really care

32:13.148 --> 32:14.845
about what happens
to me, don't you?

32:15.020 --> 32:16.760
Yeah, I do.

32:16.935 --> 32:17.936
I guess.

32:18.110 --> 32:19.676
That's nice.

32:20.895 --> 32:22.070
I like that.

32:27.162 --> 32:29.077
Hey, where is Paige?

32:29.251 --> 32:31.166
She stayed with Kyle.
What?

32:31.340 --> 32:32.951
Even after you told her?

32:33.125 --> 32:34.953
We didn't get a chance to,
Kyle beat us to the punch.

32:35.127 --> 32:36.432
And

32:36.606 --> 32:38.130
apparently she's
okay with it.

32:38.304 --> 32:40.393
Yeah, well, you know what,
I am not okay with it.

32:40.567 --> 32:41.872
PIPER:
Well, neither
am I, but

32:42.047 --> 32:43.439
first things first.
We need to get

32:43.613 --> 32:44.745
this little demon creature
out of the house.

32:44.919 --> 32:45.964
Then we need to get the

32:46.138 --> 32:47.487
information about
the Avatars so I

32:47.661 --> 32:49.097
can use it as a
leverage against the Elders.

32:49.271 --> 32:50.533
You know my terms.

32:50.707 --> 32:52.448
Your terms are ridiculous.

32:52.622 --> 32:54.015
Look, what if
I personally

32:54.189 --> 32:55.277
guarantee you get what you want?

32:55.451 --> 32:56.365
Oh, I'm

32:56.539 --> 32:57.627
supposed to trust you, now?

32:58.585 --> 32:59.455
[sighs]

33:00.543 --> 33:01.892
What is with you two?

33:02.067 --> 33:03.764
SEER:
Look, all I know
is the Avatars

33:03.938 --> 33:07.594
are a powerful force and your
secret weapon is locked in here.

33:07.768 --> 33:09.509
Ugh... Phoebe, would you
please speak to her?

33:09.683 --> 33:11.163
Okay,

33:11.337 --> 33:13.948
remember how you said that
you can sense that I care

33:14.122 --> 33:15.776
about you?
Well, I
Mm-hm.

33:15.950 --> 33:17.734
can sense that you care
about me, too.

33:19.258 --> 33:22.000
So, please, give me the
information that we need.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.307
I can't tell you.

33:27.788 --> 33:28.876
But I can show you.

33:38.842 --> 33:40.801
Phoebe.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.502
[excited chattering]

33:58.253 --> 34:00.081
Hi, Aunt Phoebe.

34:00.255 --> 34:02.214
Hi, Wyatt. Hi, big guy.

34:03.476 --> 34:05.217
Mommy, mommy!Oh, hi!

34:06.305 --> 34:10.135
What are you doing,
my little ladybug?

34:10.309 --> 34:13.094
Mommy, Chris was scaring me
about the demons again.

34:13.268 --> 34:15.314
Chris, it's not
nice to tease.

34:15.488 --> 34:16.924
What did I tell you
about the demons?

34:17.098 --> 34:18.708
They don't exist anymore.

34:18.882 --> 34:20.275
Not since the Avatars.

34:22.799 --> 34:24.279
She's smiling, right?
That's good.

34:24.453 --> 34:26.934
She's seeing Utopia.

34:27.108 --> 34:28.544
No demons...

34:30.024 --> 34:31.852
beyond good and evil.

34:32.026 --> 34:32.766
[gasps]

34:42.863 --> 34:46.040
You betrayed me. Now you pay.

34:47.172 --> 34:47.737
[grunts]

34:47.911 --> 34:49.739
[screaming]

34:54.266 --> 34:55.441
What?

34:55.615 --> 34:57.095
What was it?
What happened?

34:57.269 --> 34:59.097
I saw the most
beautiful thing ever.

35:02.274 --> 35:03.797
And the most terrible.

35:09.803 --> 35:11.587
SEER:
Now you know
why I'm doing this.

35:11.761 --> 35:13.763
Yeah, with no demons
in the future,

35:13.937 --> 35:14.938
you'd be extinct.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.462
If I even get
to that future,

35:16.636 --> 35:18.681
which if Zankou
has his way, I won't.

35:18.855 --> 35:20.770
Let's just keep in mind that
the future's volatile, okay?

35:20.944 --> 35:22.468
The choices we make,
the things we do

35:22.642 --> 35:24.600
could change it;
what you saw may
never happen.

35:24.774 --> 35:26.863
But if the good part
of what I saw could happen,

35:27.037 --> 35:28.474
that would be great,
because it was incredible.

35:28.648 --> 35:29.910
I was so happy

35:30.084 --> 35:31.651
and calm and
peaceful

35:31.825 --> 35:33.566
and my little girl--
oh, my gosh, she was so cute.

35:33.740 --> 35:34.784
Yeah,

35:34.958 --> 35:36.003
not normally big
on the rugrats,

35:36.177 --> 35:37.178
but she was cute.

35:37.352 --> 35:38.962
Now I'm even
more worried

35:39.137 --> 35:41.139
about Paige. Kyle wants
to destroy something

35:41.313 --> 35:42.618
that could potentially
be really great.

35:42.792 --> 35:44.098
Okay, hang on
a second.

35:44.272 --> 35:45.273
We don't know
any of this

35:45.447 --> 35:46.709
for sure and even you made

35:46.883 --> 35:48.146
the Avatar future
seem threatening.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.843
Well, duh, if

35:50.017 --> 35:51.236
I made it sound peachy,
you wouldn't have helped me.

35:51.410 --> 35:52.976
The fact is,

35:53.151 --> 35:54.239
I didn't see
anything threatening.

35:54.413 --> 35:55.501
How about you, Leo?

35:58.504 --> 36:01.246
Okay, yeah, see seriously,
what is it with you two?

36:02.247 --> 36:03.639
Are you going to tell her

36:03.813 --> 36:04.771
or shall I?

36:06.033 --> 36:07.252
I told you I liked a challenge.

36:07.426 --> 36:09.297
So what's it going to be?

36:10.907 --> 36:12.126
Look,

36:12.300 --> 36:14.172
apparently what
she has seen is

36:14.346 --> 36:17.175
that I know the
Avatars are good,

36:17.349 --> 36:19.916
because I'm an Avatar.

36:20.090 --> 36:20.874
What?

36:21.048 --> 36:22.484
That's insane.

36:22.658 --> 36:24.051
What does that mean?

36:24.225 --> 36:25.748
That means that I believe
in what they want.

36:25.922 --> 36:27.446
A world beyond
good and evil.

36:27.620 --> 36:28.664
Wait, are you
saying that

36:28.838 --> 36:29.970
you've been living in our house

36:30.144 --> 36:31.363
as an Avatar and you haven't

36:31.537 --> 36:33.539
told us?Hey, look, I'm the same old Leo.

36:33.713 --> 36:34.888
Only... not!

36:35.062 --> 36:35.889
Is this
how you went

36:36.063 --> 36:37.630
from psycho crazy guy

36:37.804 --> 36:39.327
to happy, happy guy,
because you became an Avatar?

36:39.501 --> 36:41.416
What changed
for me was

36:41.590 --> 36:43.592
knowing that we could have
this life that we always wanted.

36:43.766 --> 36:45.377
A life without demons.

36:45.551 --> 36:47.292
You know, they showed
me this peaceful

36:47.466 --> 36:48.641
world,

36:48.815 --> 36:50.860
happy like Phoebe saw
in her vision.

36:51.034 --> 36:54.168
The point is not happy; the
point is why didn't you tell me?

36:54.342 --> 36:56.388
Well, I couldn't tell you
until you were ready.

36:56.562 --> 36:57.780
Look, everybody has

36:57.954 --> 36:59.042
to come to the truth
in their own time.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.305
Okay, Leo,
you know what,

37:00.479 --> 37:01.610
don't guru-talk me,

37:01.784 --> 37:03.351
because you
are in far

37:03.525 --> 37:04.961
too much trouble,
if you think...Okay, guys,

37:05.135 --> 37:06.224
guys, Can we just

37:06.398 --> 37:07.790
put this on hold
for a second?

37:07.964 --> 37:10.576
She's right.
This can wait, she can't.

37:10.750 --> 37:11.968
I've seen her vanquish
and we have to make

37:12.142 --> 37:13.405
her human
right now.

37:13.579 --> 37:14.928
She held up her
end of the deal;

37:15.102 --> 37:16.016
now it's the
Elders' turn.

37:16.190 --> 37:17.539
Okay, well, I can't exactly

37:17.713 --> 37:19.062
go to the Elders
and say the seer saw Utopia.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.150
They're not going to believe me.

37:20.325 --> 37:21.413
No, but they will believe me.

37:21.587 --> 37:22.588
Piper's going to

37:22.762 --> 37:23.850
help you get your
stuff together

37:24.024 --> 37:25.155
for your new life.
And if I were you,

37:25.330 --> 37:26.896
I'd go upstairs
and get the dress

37:27.070 --> 37:28.028
that matches those earrings
'cause you're

37:28.202 --> 37:29.247
going to look amazing in it.

37:29.421 --> 37:30.465
We'll be

37:30.639 --> 37:32.075
right back with
the spell.

37:38.952 --> 37:40.301
[clears
throat]

37:42.390 --> 37:44.436
What is she doing here?

37:44.610 --> 37:47.221
I'm here to give
you what you want.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.878
So, the seer
told you something.

37:52.052 --> 37:53.445
LEO:
Yes.

37:53.619 --> 37:56.099
She told us that the
Avatars' future is a Utopia.

37:56.274 --> 37:59.233
That's not possible.

37:59.407 --> 38:00.539
I've seen it.

38:00.713 --> 38:02.018
It's going to take
more than that.

38:02.192 --> 38:03.759
That's why I'm here
to show it to you.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.336
PHOEBE:
What did I tell you
about the demons?

38:15.510 --> 38:17.773
They don't exist anymore.

38:17.947 --> 38:19.514
Not since the Avatars.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.432
It's not possible.

38:24.606 --> 38:25.868
This must be some
sort of a trick.

38:26.042 --> 38:27.174
You've seen
the vision.

38:27.348 --> 38:29.307
Take your time
sorting it out.

38:29.481 --> 38:30.786
But I will need
that spell.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.528
But this might be all a sham.

38:33.702 --> 38:34.747
Then it's not the seer's fault.

38:34.921 --> 38:36.444
She's just
the messenger.

38:36.618 --> 38:38.011
But you do

38:38.185 --> 38:40.274
have to honor your
end of the deal.

38:48.456 --> 38:50.502
Oh, hi, I'm glad you're here.

38:50.676 --> 38:51.720
I was worried about you.

38:51.894 --> 38:53.679
I was picking up
some clothes.

38:53.853 --> 38:55.028
Oh.

38:55.202 --> 38:57.335
Well, if you're, uh,
looking for your red

38:57.509 --> 38:58.814
winter jacket
with the missing button,

38:58.988 --> 39:00.338
I, uh, gave it to the seer.

39:00.512 --> 39:02.383
Why, do demons feel cold?

39:02.557 --> 39:04.733
Except she won't be
a demon anymore.

39:04.907 --> 39:06.996
The seer told us something
about the Avatars?

39:07.170 --> 39:08.824
Even better,
because of

39:08.998 --> 39:11.871
their shared power, she was able
to give Phoebe her vision.

39:12.045 --> 39:13.351
How bad was it?

39:13.525 --> 39:15.309
That's the thing.

39:15.483 --> 39:17.572
According to Phoebe,
it was good.

39:17.746 --> 39:22.098
And you're willing to believe
a demon over Kyle?

39:22.272 --> 39:23.578
I don't believe
one way or another.

39:23.752 --> 39:25.624
I'm just trying
to keep an open mind.

39:25.798 --> 39:27.103
Piper, everything
we know about them,

39:27.277 --> 39:29.105
everything points
to them being killers.

39:29.279 --> 39:32.370
Don't you think that
maybe we should explore

39:32.544 --> 39:33.849
what they're all
about just in case?

39:34.023 --> 39:35.024
Explore what?

39:35.198 --> 39:36.330
How about this?

39:36.504 --> 39:37.853
Why don't you explore?

39:38.027 --> 39:39.377
When you find something out,
give me a call,

39:39.551 --> 39:40.769
because I'll be there
to vanquish them

39:40.943 --> 39:42.467
with Kyle's potion. Okay?

39:48.777 --> 39:50.126
Hmm.

39:53.956 --> 39:56.219
You know, I don't think
Phoebe would mind

39:56.394 --> 39:57.743
throwing in some shoes.

39:57.917 --> 40:00.136
Oh, thanks, but I
won't need them.

40:00.310 --> 40:01.747
As soon as I'm human,

40:01.921 --> 40:04.358
I'm hoping your guy will
orb me to Golden Gate Park

40:04.532 --> 40:07.013
and I can finally run
through that grass.

40:07.187 --> 40:09.276
Have you thought
of a name for yourself?

40:09.450 --> 40:11.800
Oh, it's Kira.
It always has been.

40:11.974 --> 40:15.456
It's just everyone
calls me, uh, the seer.

40:15.630 --> 40:18.764
Okay, honestly now...

40:18.938 --> 40:21.767
How do I look?

40:21.941 --> 40:23.769
I've never worn
anything so...

40:23.943 --> 40:26.206
fun.

40:26.380 --> 40:29.035
Kira, you look great.

40:29.209 --> 40:30.471
Thanks.

40:31.472 --> 40:32.952
Did you get
the spell?

40:33.126 --> 40:34.910
Uh, Leo's got it.

40:35.084 --> 40:37.565
He's downstairs trying to
convince Paige not to leave.

40:37.739 --> 40:39.219
Yeah, I know,
I already tried.

40:39.393 --> 40:40.655
Um...

40:40.829 --> 40:42.265
look, we're kind of
pushing it here,

40:42.440 --> 40:44.137
the demon could show
up any minute, so...

40:44.311 --> 40:46.618
Maybe you should
get the spell.
Yeah.

40:48.707 --> 40:50.448
Hey.

40:51.579 --> 40:53.581
You look really great.

40:53.755 --> 40:56.497
Sure you don't mind
me borrowing it?

40:56.671 --> 40:58.151
No, not at all.

40:58.325 --> 41:01.023
Although I'm much more of a
black kind of guy myself.

41:01.197 --> 41:02.938
I think it's a lot
more appropriate

41:03.112 --> 41:04.592
for a funeral.

41:04.766 --> 41:06.507
Don't you, Kira?

41:06.681 --> 41:09.292
Wait. How did you...

41:11.599 --> 41:12.600
Hello, sugar.

41:12.774 --> 41:15.255
Did I call you that ever?

41:15.429 --> 41:17.475
What I meant to say was:

41:17.649 --> 41:20.434
"Hello, swirling
particles of scum."

41:20.608 --> 41:22.131
You always were amusing.

41:22.305 --> 41:24.482
But still, I can't allow you

41:24.656 --> 41:26.658
to betray us all
just to save your own ass.

41:28.050 --> 41:29.095
Ahh!

41:29.835 --> 41:30.792
[screams]

41:30.966 --> 41:32.707
It's good to be back.

41:36.798 --> 41:38.060
[buzzing][screaming]

41:44.937 --> 41:46.112
That wasn't you.

41:46.286 --> 41:48.897
That was the demon
from my vision.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.904
We can't keep
doing this.

41:56.078 --> 41:57.602
There's got to
be a better way.

41:57.776 --> 41:59.604
There is a better way.
She showed it

41:59.778 --> 42:01.301
to me and
it was beautiful.

42:01.475 --> 42:03.129
I think I want
to meet them.

42:03.303 --> 42:04.434
And I want you

42:04.609 --> 42:05.827
to, but...

42:06.001 --> 42:07.655
I think you need a
clear mind to do so,

42:07.829 --> 42:09.701
and I don't know that
now's the right time.

42:09.875 --> 42:12.617
Now is the best time.

42:14.706 --> 42:16.098
You sure?

42:16.272 --> 42:17.578
We're sure.

42:17.752 --> 42:19.319
Call them.

42:27.457 --> 42:29.764
We're listening.
