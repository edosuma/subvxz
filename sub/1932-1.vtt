03:51.959 --> 03:52.542
Alright?

03:58.042 --> 04:00.126
Ok? Are you ok?

04:00.334 --> 04:01.209
Ok, ok

04:16.416 --> 04:16.916
Where are the people?

04:21.625 --> 04:22.251
All here

04:25.417 --> 04:26.959
You saved one but lost two

04:33.626 --> 04:36.584
Which is more important?
Our teammates or the dummies?

04:38.042 --> 04:38.792
In a fire scene

04:38.834 --> 04:41.292
We don't get to choose.
Discipline is everything

04:43.251 --> 04:43.917
Discipline?

04:44.334 --> 04:44.876
Next team!

05:03.084 --> 05:04.292
Nowadays there're all high-rise buildings

05:04.334 --> 05:05.834
Fire protection systems become more important

05:06.417 --> 05:07.959
If unluckily that

05:08.792 --> 05:10.042
Upper levels are on fire

05:10.667 --> 05:11.626
It's difficult to carry out rescue

05:12.959 --> 05:15.251
As firefighters...
the most important thing is to save people

05:16.334 --> 05:19.001
Enough talking

05:19.459 --> 05:21.834
You two must come and help me

05:22.417 --> 05:24.626
People now have a strong sense of fire prevention

05:25.459 --> 05:27.001
This business must take off

05:27.042 --> 05:28.167
I can give you suggestions...

05:28.209 --> 05:29.542
on the design of your
fire protection systems

05:29.959 --> 05:31.251
What do you mean, suggestions?

05:31.292 --> 05:33.084
I want is you two to work for me

05:33.251 --> 05:35.459
Sure. I'll file my transfer
request and join you

05:37.084 --> 05:37.792
How about you?

05:39.626 --> 05:40.584
I'm sorry, uncle

05:41.334 --> 05:42.501
But I just got a promotion

05:44.209 --> 05:46.709
Tai Kwan, think about it

05:46.959 --> 05:48.667
Isn't it good to spend your energy
for a worthier cause...

05:48.709 --> 05:50.126
to help more people?

05:52.667 --> 05:54.834
Every year much farmland
is turned into skyscrapers

05:55.667 --> 05:57.459
Farmers keep moving to the city

05:58.376 --> 05:59.501
Sometimes I think...

05:59.917 --> 06:01.459
not until we run out
of rice in supermarkets

06:02.084 --> 06:04.001
do we know how important farmers are

06:25.584 --> 06:26.917
Today foggy weather

06:26.959 --> 06:29.001
prevails over Guangzhou

06:29.501 --> 06:30.626
According to the Observatory
(Four Years Later)

06:30.667 --> 06:33.626
affected by rainstorms over the past three days,
the weather is humid

06:33.667 --> 06:36.792
Today the temperature increases sharply
dueto the bright sunshine

06:36.834 --> 06:38.751
and it brings radiation fog

06:39.251 --> 06:41.334
The temperature is 34 degrees

06:41.376 --> 06:43.417
relative humidity is 99%

06:43.459 --> 06:44.376
Weather is very humid

06:44.667 --> 06:46.292
Hi friend...

06:48.667 --> 06:49.709
You had chocolate again?

06:49.751 --> 06:50.792
No I didn't

06:53.959 --> 06:54.792
You didn't?

06:58.376 --> 06:59.792
It's never bothered me before

07:01.001 --> 07:01.709
but...

07:02.542 --> 07:04.959
you'll be a father soon.
Cut down on junk food.

07:05.917 --> 07:06.792
You see...

07:07.917 --> 07:08.876
it melted like hell.

07:09.334 --> 07:11.376
It's been there forever uneaten.
I just didn't throw it away

07:12.542 --> 07:13.792
Did you drink the vitamin shake...

07:13.834 --> 07:14.709
I bought you!

07:14.876 --> 07:16.292
What's in it?

07:18.959 --> 07:19.876
Meaning you never tried it

07:20.251 --> 07:21.084
Of course, I did

07:22.001 --> 07:24.792
You told me to drink it after meals every day.
And I did

07:25.751 --> 07:27.667
After going to the doctor with me,
when is your meeting?

07:27.917 --> 07:29.542
I can't go to the doctor with you

07:30.084 --> 07:31.792
I'll leave after dropping you off

07:32.042 --> 07:32.959
Haven't I told you?

07:33.001 --> 07:34.126
When did you tell me?

07:35.959 --> 07:37.584
I don't remember.
But I did anyway

07:37.626 --> 07:38.292
No you didn't

07:38.542 --> 07:39.542
Did too...

07:39.584 --> 07:41.167
Did not.

07:42.751 --> 07:43.834
Maybe I didn't...

07:44.959 --> 07:45.917
They moved the meeting up

07:47.751 --> 07:49.417
Just call me when you're done, ok?

07:53.251 --> 07:55.376
Do you have problem
accepting my pregnancy?

07:55.459 --> 07:57.251
Of course not.

07:57.334 --> 07:59.251
I told you I want a baby

07:59.417 --> 08:01.001
And now you're pregnant,
how perfect

08:01.626 --> 08:03.251
You want it because I forced you to...

08:03.292 --> 08:04.417
do you really want it?

08:12.167 --> 08:13.042
How about resignation?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.542
Shall we discuss it tonight?

08:27.959 --> 08:30.209
We've talked about it so many times.
I just want you to know...

08:30.626 --> 08:31.751
it's all for our child

08:31.792 --> 08:33.167
Yes, I know

08:37.001 --> 08:37.833
Just chute it for me.

08:37.876 --> 08:38.751
I'm not eating it anyway

08:44.251 --> 08:45.459
Remember to call me
after seeing the doctor

08:47.417 --> 08:47.959
Ok

08:48.709 --> 08:49.334
Bye

08:49.376 --> 08:49.959
Take care

09:24.501 --> 09:25.334
Keung?

09:27.001 --> 09:27.751
Si Lok

09:28.042 --> 09:29.209
Long time no see

09:29.751 --> 09:30.542
Yes, it's been a while

09:31.334 --> 09:32.126
How are you?

09:32.501 --> 09:35.459
Pretty good. My company opens today,
on the 40th floor

09:35.834 --> 09:36.626
Wow

09:37.292 --> 09:38.001
My business card

09:39.542 --> 09:40.959
Fire Protection Company?

09:41.459 --> 09:43.584
We take careof the
fire protection systems in this building

09:44.126 --> 09:44.959
Director Mak, huh?

09:47.042 --> 09:48.292
Drop by to see me some time

09:48.334 --> 09:49.042
Of course

09:49.584 --> 09:51.334
I think your brother
should be available tonight

09:51.376 --> 09:52.334
Maybe we come together

09:54.292 --> 09:55.751
Firefighters don't have plans

09:56.001 --> 09:57.834
Ask him to come only
if he truly wants to

10:00.126 --> 10:00.792
Which floor?

10:00.834 --> 10:02.584
14th. Over here

10:06.917 --> 10:08.417
You haven't seen your brother
for four years, right?

10:14.251 --> 10:14.959
I got to go

10:18.376 --> 10:20.251
That's it.
Wait for the next car please

10:21.959 --> 10:23.292
I'll pay you next month..

10:23.334 --> 10:24.417
Will I run away?

10:25.084 --> 10:25.959
What do you want?

10:27.459 --> 10:28.084
Excuse us...

10:29.334 --> 10:30.042
I'm hanging UP

10:30.709 --> 10:32.584
What's with the rush?

10:35.709 --> 10:37.001
Wow, we paid $9.7 more

10:38.542 --> 10:40.001
I told you to walk one block further

10:40.501 --> 10:41.584
They take an extra 5% off

10:43.959 --> 10:45.751
You keep your hands on the
calculatorall the day

10:46.167 --> 10:48.459
Just stop pinching every penny

10:48.834 --> 10:50.792
We don't even have time
for a family photo

10:51.959 --> 10:54.959
Fine that you're not helping.
Stop making light of my problem

10:55.209 --> 10:57.459
Mom, can I have one more?

10:58.501 --> 11:00.876
No, you can't. You've had two.

11:11.084 --> 11:13.667
We will test the fire alarm today.
The bells on each floor will ring.

11:13.709 --> 11:14.959
Don't panic

11:24.459 --> 11:25.917
Director Mak

11:37.292 --> 11:38.126
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

11:38.459 --> 11:40.584
I apologize for being a bit late

11:41.459 --> 11:42.584
I propose a toast

11:48.876 --> 11:49.959
Feel free to check out our products

11:52.334 --> 11:53.126
What takes you so long?

11:54.626 --> 11:57.001
At this hour,
the whole Guangzhou is gridlocked

11:57.501 --> 11:59.709
I've just confirmed contract terms with
Director Tsang and Director Wong

11:59.876 --> 12:00.959
Don't drink too much

12:01.042 --> 12:03.959
You have a cooperative agreement to sign
with the Fire Department at 4pm

12:05.126 --> 12:06.167
Ok. You'll take care of it

12:06.834 --> 12:08.042
Don't drink too much, ok?

12:08.084 --> 12:08.667
Ok

12:16.542 --> 12:17.626
No problem with the goods, right?

12:18.917 --> 12:20.792
But it looks like the balance is not settled yet

12:29.667 --> 12:30.542
Ho

12:34.251 --> 12:35.251
It's the same

12:36.376 --> 12:39.251
How could they be the same?
Have you got your eyes checked?

12:39.584 --> 12:40.417
I told you to get some new paint

12:40.667 --> 12:41.626
What's up honey?

12:42.292 --> 12:42.959
See?

12:48.959 --> 12:49.751
Get her some new paint

12:50.959 --> 12:52.001
What are you laughing at?

13:06.376 --> 13:07.417
It's sophisticated

13:08.084 --> 13:08.917
Very innovative

13:08.959 --> 13:11.584
This is a fire extinguishing
grenadewe developed for home use

13:11.834 --> 13:14.459
it's smaller and more effective
than the old one

13:14.501 --> 13:16.417
Keung, let me introduce

13:17.292 --> 13:17.917
Excuse me

13:19.501 --> 13:21.417
Mandy, Get two drinks for the directors

13:21.709 --> 13:22.751
Director Tsang. Hello.

13:23.376 --> 13:24.292
Director Wong. Hi.

13:24.334 --> 13:26.626
There couple who made it 
this big in just four years

13:27.001 --> 13:28.751
Keung, very well done.

13:29.626 --> 13:32.209
She hasn't said yes.
I'm still courting her

13:32.459 --> 13:34.001
Looking forward to working with you

13:34.042 --> 13:34.626
Same here

13:34.959 --> 13:36.126
You used to be a firefighter

13:36.167 --> 13:38.334
It's the perfect job for you

13:40.917 --> 13:42.584
I used to think I'd be a firefighter for life

13:43.959 --> 13:44.959
We did training drills
and wiped down the tools

13:46.626 --> 13:47.459
every daY

13:50.542 --> 13:51.584
Accidents don't wait

13:53.584 --> 13:55.084
We can only be prepared
in the best possible ways

13:56.626 --> 13:57.626
But whenever I see...

13:59.209 --> 14:00.542
someone died in a fire

14:03.084 --> 14:04.084
I asked myself

14:05.167 --> 14:06.542
Was there more I could've done?

14:09.292 --> 14:09.959
In the past...

14:11.292 --> 14:12.959
I saved one person at a time

14:14.292 --> 14:14.959
But now...

14:15.959 --> 14:19.001
I want our fire protection systems
to protect more people

14:42.501 --> 14:43.542
(Air Conditioning System Control Room)

14:44.334 --> 14:46.042
Hey guys. It's so humid.

14:46.292 --> 14:47.376
Without electricity and air conditioning

14:47.417 --> 14:49.042
mm Us QIJI]

14:49.084 --> 14:51.376
We'll fix it before sunset

14:52.084 --> 14:53.626
I'm not pushing you, but...

14:53.667 --> 14:55.792
can you get it done any sooner?

14:55.876 --> 14:57.959
Equipment in the electrical roomneeds
constant temperature

14:58.792 --> 14:59.917
Blame it on the weather...

14:59.959 --> 15:01.126
for being so abnormal

15:01.167 --> 15:02.709
it's July already but still humid

15:02.959 --> 15:03.751
and fOQQY

15:04.084 --> 15:05.084
Do your best. Thanks.

15:26.792 --> 15:30.876
(Physician Cheung Kin Lok)

15:35.542 --> 15:36.834
Lam Si Lok, please come with me

15:49.792 --> 15:50.334
Dad

15:51.834 --> 15:54.542
Was there a notice ordering the occupant
on 32/F to remove the bottled water?

15:55.251 --> 15:57.126
They haven't removed it?

15:58.001 --> 16:01.459
Not yet...
Looks like they've stacked more

16:02.251 --> 16:04.709
Ok, I come to take a look,
you continue your work

16:05.417 --> 16:05.959
Got it

16:14.417 --> 16:16.042
Sir, I decide to quit

16:20.751 --> 16:21.792
Since six years ago...

16:22.501 --> 16:24.042
you've got married

16:24.542 --> 16:26.209
I have expected you'd leave one day

16:26.376 --> 16:27.584
I hope you would understand

16:28.084 --> 16:29.876
Tai Kwan, to be honest with you...

16:30.459 --> 16:32.667
the department has
confirmed your promotion

16:33.292 --> 16:36.001
It's a pity that you decide to
quit at this point

16:38.542 --> 16:39.459
but I've made up my mind

16:44.251 --> 16:45.667
Day 89. 3 months already

16:46.209 --> 16:47.042
How do you feel?

16:49.959 --> 16:51.251
I start having morning sickness

16:52.167 --> 16:53.376
I don't feel like eating all day

16:54.209 --> 16:56.292
That's normal.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.584
It's strange that your husband
never comes with you

16:59.459 --> 17:00.751
for check up.

17:13.416 --> 17:17.001
(To Si Lok. How's it?)

17:19.959 --> 17:21.126
he must find time to stop by

17:21.416 --> 17:22.876
no matter how busy he is

17:23.251 --> 17:24.916
I'll give him a lecture on being a father

17:28.667 --> 17:30.542
Ok. You take a break.
I'll get some film.

17:39.001 --> 17:39.584
Dinner time

17:40.042 --> 17:41.084
Let's go

18:05.334 --> 18:07.167
Your flight for Hangzhou departs at 9pm tonight.
You have a contract to sign

18:07.376 --> 18:08.292
I'll drive you to the airport

18:08.917 --> 18:10.042
I'll drive you to the airport

18:11.042 --> 18:13.917
Tonight?
Tonight I've booked a table... go change it

18:13.959 --> 18:16.001
No way.
We scheduled the meeting last week

18:17.167 --> 18:18.209
Call them to change the appointment

18:19.334 --> 18:20.042
Call them

18:21.626 --> 18:22.251
Come on

18:42.709 --> 18:43.834
That's it?
Not trying hard enough

18:44.209 --> 18:45.126
What do you mean?

18:54.459 --> 18:55.209
What do you mean?

18:56.667 --> 18:58.001
Opening surprise?

19:05.001 --> 19:06.251
I need you...

19:07.959 --> 19:09.042
with or without this company

19:11.334 --> 19:11.959
Marry me?

19:31.959 --> 19:33.126
Why didn't you notify me
before you test the alarms?

19:33.292 --> 19:35.709
Boss, I haven't started testing.

19:35.751 --> 19:37.626
Then what happened?
How come the panel lights up on every floor?

19:38.459 --> 19:39.876
Is it a fire or false alarm?

19:40.209 --> 19:42.084
Just got a call from the main mechanical room

19:42.126 --> 19:45.626
The system server hangs because the extreme humidity today

19:46.459 --> 19:49.084
Temperature in that room is supposed
to be constant always. How can it be humid?

19:49.126 --> 19:51.501
Security office sent us a memo

19:51.542 --> 19:53.376
saying the air-conditioning room
is under repair today

19:53.417 --> 19:55.084
Part of the basement
may not have air-conditioning

19:55.709 --> 19:59.001
We didn't expect it to be so foggy
as soon as the air-conditioning is off...

19:59.417 --> 20:01.792
and walls are sweating like in spring

20:03.917 --> 20:05.126
When I was a firefighter...

20:05.417 --> 20:07.084
false alarms on a humid day were quite normal

20:07.417 --> 20:09.209
But I've never seen a whole building
without air conditioning as a result

20:09.876 --> 20:11.001
Boss, We're working on it.

20:11.042 --> 20:12.126
Go find out what's wrong.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.084
Of course

20:20.751 --> 20:21.417
Now what?

20:21.834 --> 20:23.126
I've called engineering department

20:23.167 --> 20:24.501
They are sending someone over

20:24.542 --> 20:26.834
Air conditioning will resume in an hour

20:27.126 --> 20:28.501
I'll get someone to dehumidify the room

20:29.251 --> 20:31.834
But the fire system will be down for 5 minutes.
Things will be back to normal after that

20:32.751 --> 20:33.376
I give you 3 minutes

20:33.417 --> 20:35.209
Ok. Got it. I'll try my best!

21:07.167 --> 21:09.334
Boss, The short circuit problem is fixed

21:09.751 --> 21:10.584
Has the signal resumed normal?

21:10.959 --> 21:11.542
Hang on

21:18.709 --> 21:20.792
Check the air conditioning room

21:21.251 --> 21:22.334
See if it's just a false alarm

21:23.959 --> 21:24.459
Ok, got it

21:25.834 --> 21:26.209
Leave it for now

21:27.042 --> 21:28.834
Check the air conditioning room first

21:28.876 --> 21:29.501
Move it...

21:30.334 --> 21:31.292
Quick

22:07.084 --> 22:08.542
Keung, what happened?

22:13.417 --> 22:15.167
There's a fire in the basement
air conditioning room

22:15.209 --> 22:17.209
affecting the voltage and causing a outage

22:18.667 --> 22:19.376
But please don't worry

22:20.167 --> 22:21.501
Our backup power source is on...

22:21.876 --> 22:22.792
enough for 8 hours

22:23.667 --> 22:25.167
The alarm system reported to fire to the police

22:25.209 --> 22:26.376
Firefighters will be here any minute

22:27.042 --> 22:28.126
For your safety...

22:28.542 --> 22:30.292
I'll arrange an emergency evacuation

22:30.542 --> 22:32.251
But please don't panic, Ok?

22:32.959 --> 22:33.709
That way please

22:38.667 --> 22:39.167
Mandy

22:40.126 --> 22:41.334
Escort the guests out via staircase #1

22:42.001 --> 22:42.834
Take the surviving kits

22:43.042 --> 22:43.584
Ok!

23:24.917 --> 23:27.292
Fire... run...

23:42.126 --> 23:42.667
Trigger the alarm

23:44.001 --> 23:45.792
One-alarm fire

23:46.126 --> 23:47.959
Jiangxi team to lift

23:48.376 --> 23:50.542
Major pump, tower ladder,
light rescue unit

23:50.584 --> 23:51.626
Commander car

23:52.042 --> 23:53.917
Guangzhou International Commercial Centre,
Jiangxi Road

24:54.959 --> 24:56.292
Watch out.
We have a pregnant woman here...

24:57.376 --> 24:57.959
Are you ok?

24:58.626 --> 24:59.292
Can you walk?

25:00.584 --> 25:01.167
Go!

25:02.626 --> 25:03.167
Tai Kwan!

25:04.209 --> 25:05.876
Where are you?
There's a fire here

25:05.917 --> 25:06.917
Your husband the firefighter?

25:06.959 --> 25:07.501
Don't worry.

25:07.542 --> 25:08.251
I'm on my way

25:08.876 --> 25:09.667
Where exactly you are in the building?

25:09.959 --> 25:10.917
What do you see?

25:11.292 --> 25:13.792
We've left the clinic.
I'm with the doctor

25:14.584 --> 25:15.459
But the hallway is full of smoke

25:18.001 --> 25:18.709
Let's go now!

25:19.959 --> 25:21.251
I told you to come with me
but you didn't

25:21.667 --> 25:23.417
People are bumping on
each other now

25:24.084 --> 25:24.876
Get the doctor on the line

25:27.959 --> 25:29.417
Leave the building with Si Lok now

25:29.876 --> 25:32.042
We can't! The fire is too big
for us to go down

25:36.501 --> 25:37.251
Come save us now

25:37.376 --> 25:38.709
The fire is getting bigger.

25:38.751 --> 25:39.542
Pass the phone to Si Lok

25:40.792 --> 25:41.667
What do we do now?

25:42.376 --> 25:43.876
The smoke is too dense downstairs.
Go upstairs instead

25:44.001 --> 25:45.126
There's a refuge floor upstairs

25:45.167 --> 25:47.459
It's the safest place.
You know what I'm saying?

25:47.667 --> 25:48.876
Your brother is in the building too!

25:51.001 --> 25:53.209
Don't worry. I'll be right there.
See you in a bit

25:55.334 --> 25:56.167
He told us to go upstairs

25:56.501 --> 25:58.084
Upstairs, this way...
This way, upstairs...

26:41.417 --> 26:42.834
Captain, Everything is ready

26:43.834 --> 26:44.542
Get on the commander car

26:44.584 --> 26:45.126
Copy that

26:46.251 --> 26:48.417
Here, 2nd floor here

26:48.584 --> 26:49.084
Chief

26:51.876 --> 26:53.209
he fire started in the basement

26:53.626 --> 26:56.376
The alarm system in the whole
building broke down

26:56.959 --> 26:59.209
A trading company
on 1/F caught fire

26:59.626 --> 27:01.584
Bring a team into the building and
start the search and rescue

27:02.042 --> 27:02.959
Yes, Sir

27:09.959 --> 27:11.459
051 calling control team

27:13.126 --> 27:16.584
Request raising it to a two-alarm fire

27:17.251 --> 27:18.334
Send in the second squad

27:18.792 --> 27:21.501
Water truck, tower ladder straight
to the scene

27:35.917 --> 27:36.834
Are you ok?

27:36.876 --> 27:37.459
I'm fine

27:41.376 --> 27:43.042
(Tai Kwan)

27:47.417 --> 27:47.959
Keung

27:49.084 --> 27:49.667
Yes

27:49.959 --> 27:51.334
I arrived.
How're things over there?

27:52.917 --> 27:54.959
I'm leading the people down the stairs.
The basement is on fire

27:55.667 --> 27:57.376
If you can contain it,
you don't have to raise it to two-alarm

27:57.792 --> 28:00.126
it's two-alarm already.
There was an explosion on 1st floor

28:00.459 --> 28:02.126
Are you sure about
the situation right now?

28:04.917 --> 28:05.542
Are you ok?

28:06.334 --> 28:07.459
It's clear of smoke or flame over here

28:07.876 --> 28:09.292
My fire system can handle it

28:09.584 --> 28:10.667
The lower floors are all on fire

28:10.834 --> 28:12.042
Don't bring people down any more

28:15.167 --> 28:16.292
I'm in staircase #1 on the 18/F

28:17.709 --> 28:18.917
ls it okay to get on the tower
ladder from 15/F?

28:19.292 --> 28:20.459
Tower ladder has arrived.

28:20.792 --> 28:22.542
Start loading victims in 5 minutes

28:22.959 --> 28:23.626
Listen

28:24.167 --> 28:25.334
Listen... Wait...

28:25.376 --> 28:27.209
Firefighters will wait for us on the 15/F

28:48.209 --> 28:48.959
Let's go

28:49.459 --> 28:51.001
Go. May May.
There's a fire.Get out of here.

28:57.501 --> 29:00.209
Quick... Get water!

29:03.501 --> 29:07.501
Ho, help me. Ho...

29:13.001 --> 29:13.959
Stay here. Don't go anywhere...

29:14.126 --> 29:14.876
and wait for papa to come back

29:16.959 --> 29:17.751
Seriously, don't go anywhere

29:24.251 --> 29:25.709
Ho, no!

29:25.751 --> 29:27.917
Listen to me...
He owes us wages anyway

29:28.126 --> 29:30.334
We just get what we deserve.
Don't stop me.

29:36.084 --> 29:37.834
May may, what are you doing?

29:38.126 --> 29:38.917
Go!

29:39.209 --> 29:39.792
My shQp...

29:39.834 --> 29:40.917

29:41.251 --> 29:42.167
Go!

29:45.959 --> 29:46.584
Go!

29:47.834 --> 29:48.376
Give them back...

29:48.417 --> 29:50.251

29:53.126 --> 29:55.042

30:47.667 --> 30:49.209
Where is Lam-lam?
Where is Lam-lam?

30:49.251 --> 30:52.417
Were you with her?
Lam-lam!

30:53.584 --> 30:54.167
Ho

31:06.209 --> 31:08.751
Dong, come with me

31:51.834 --> 31:52.501
Water

31:56.667 --> 31:58.667
Captain, fire is too big

31:59.876 --> 32:00.626
Go this way

32:17.876 --> 32:20.251
Team 1 leader, bring them to the window
over there and stand by

32:20.584 --> 32:21.126
Yes

32:21.167 --> 32:23.376
Firefighter 2, bring them to
this window and stand by

32:24.251 --> 32:24.959
Understood?

32:25.042 --> 32:25.709
Understood!

32:25.834 --> 32:26.584
Action!

33:16.042 --> 33:16.626
Yank it!

33:27.876 --> 33:28.376
Retreat!

33:35.001 --> 33:35.834
Exit there

33:36.834 --> 33:38.792
Run...

34:07.459 --> 34:08.167
The smoke is so dense

34:13.001 --> 34:14.958
Boss, There is a tower ladder
by the window

34:15.251 --> 34:15.876
Go

34:16.792 --> 34:18.626
Help... anyone...

34:19.542 --> 34:20.542
help...

34:22.583 --> 34:23.126
Go

34:38.792 --> 34:39.626
You go down first

34:40.458 --> 34:42.042
Are you insane?
Let's go together!

34:46.376 --> 34:47.083
I'll be fine

34:49.126 --> 34:49.958
Take her down

34:53.958 --> 34:54.626
Keung

34:56.001 --> 34:57.834
Go

35:02.042 --> 35:02.751
Anyone here?

35:06.376 --> 35:07.042

The tower ladder
is one floor down...

35:28.584 --> 35:30.334
Help...

36:07.334 --> 36:08.292
Did you say there is a
tower ladder?

36:09.167 --> 36:10.042
We're on the back of the building

36:10.084 --> 36:11.126
It takes too long to drive
the tower ladder here

36:15.251 --> 36:15.834
Come here...

36:16.959 --> 36:17.709
What are you doing?

36:17.959 --> 36:19.042
I'll climb one floor up

36:19.084 --> 36:19.834
and pull you guys UP

36:19.876 --> 36:20.459
What shall I do?

36:21.501 --> 36:22.792
Watch carefully.
Do the same later on.

36:22.834 --> 36:23.542
Put your legs in here

36:25.376 --> 36:27.542
Understood?
Did you understand?

36:27.584 --> 36:28.209
Yes!

36:42.417 --> 36:44.501
I'll go up first.
If the fire comes close

36:45.126 --> 36:46.834
throw this grenade to the base of the fire.
It makes the fire weaker for a while

38:11.792 --> 38:12.501
Be quick...

38:14.751 --> 38:15.459
Be quick...

38:26.959 --> 38:28.126
This way

38:41.501 --> 38:42.292
That little girl...

38:42.876 --> 38:44.959
Go save her now...

38:45.959 --> 38:46.709
Mom...

38:49.584 --> 38:51.042
No way...
We can't even save ourselves...

38:51.167 --> 38:51.876
we will both die

39:03.042 --> 39:03.751
Are you insane?

39:05.459 --> 39:07.959
Are you saving them...
or yourself?

39:08.376 --> 39:09.251
Mom...

39:37.167 --> 39:38.501
Si Lok, Come out now

39:43.834 --> 39:44.417
Ready?

39:45.792 --> 39:46.376
Be careful

39:47.292 --> 39:48.959
Relax. Stay still.
I'll pull you up

40:06.292 --> 40:06.917
Are you ok?

40:08.001 --> 40:08.751
Ok...

40:09.459 --> 40:10.459
Go save the doctor. Quick

40:12.251 --> 40:14.667
Just like what I did just now...
tie the rope around your waist

40:19.917 --> 40:20.501
Got it?

40:21.917 --> 40:23.834
Make sure your legs are tightly secured.

40:24.376 --> 40:25.042
Got it?

40:26.751 --> 40:28.084
Quick...
Start pulling...

40:41.209 --> 40:42.001
Stay still

41:11.376 --> 41:12.001
Thank you...

The commander car is over there

42:15.792 --> 42:16.917
It's in a critical state now

42:25.126 --> 42:25.876
Mom...

42:27.126 --> 42:28.917
Let me in...

42:29.251 --> 42:31.917
She's just sent me a video... Look...

43:07.459 --> 43:08.959
Captain, The hose can't reach any further

43:13.084 --> 43:14.126
Tell people down there

43:14.501 --> 43:16.334
to bring the hose and air tanks to 10/F

43:16.917 --> 43:17.417
<i>COPY</i>

43:22.834 --> 43:24.209
Si Lok, Where are you now?

43:24.959 --> 43:27.209
I don't know...
But I'm with Keung now

43:28.001 --> 43:28.584
<i>Pass him the phone</i>

43:29.626 --> 43:30.292
Your brother...

43:32.251 --> 43:32.917
Where are you?

43:33.709 --> 43:35.792
We're coming up from 10/F.
How's the situation over there?

43:36.876 --> 43:37.626
We are heading to the refuge floor

43:40.834 --> 43:41.917
Will be right there.
Don't worry

43:42.751 --> 43:43.626
When will you arrive?

43:44.917 --> 43:45.959
I'm on duty

43:46.126 --> 43:46.876
Don't take risk with Si Lok.

43:52.834 --> 43:53.542
Someone over there!

43:58.001 --> 43:59.626
I have to hang up.
Many are injured here

44:02.417 --> 44:03.251
Take care of Si Lok for me

44:05.626 --> 44:07.417
You have equipment and
a team of firefighters

44:07.917 --> 44:08.751
I have nothing

44:09.251 --> 44:10.042
Your wife is waiting for you!

44:22.126 --> 44:23.001
He said he won't be here soon

44:31.042 --> 44:33.626
Calm down, everyone.
We'll get you out very soon

44:35.376 --> 44:37.084
Calling control team...

44:39.542 --> 44:40.709
Arrange tower ladder
to get them out immediately

44:49.834 --> 44:50.501
Calm down

44:50.834 --> 44:52.001
We will get you out via tower ladder

44:56.167 --> 44:58.834
Help us...
help

45:03.501 --> 45:05.959
Help...

45:24.626 --> 45:25.834
Captain, The tower ladder is here

45:26.917 --> 45:28.209
You take the injured down
the tower ladder

45:28.417 --> 45:29.626
The rest follow me
to the refuge floor

45:53.376 --> 45:57.084
I can't walk any more...
I think I won't make it...

46:03.876 --> 46:06.876
Without that shop...
it's okay...

46:09.376 --> 46:12.876
But...
I can't live without Lam-lam...

46:13.334 --> 46:15.042
without our daughter...

46:16.834 --> 46:17.417
If you have to go

46:19.167 --> 46:20.167
Let's look for her together

46:28.126 --> 46:30.501
Bo-keung

46:33.084 --> 46:33.792
Bo-keung

46:35.917 --> 46:36.667
Bo-keung!

46:47.334 --> 46:48.042
Bo-keung...

46:48.834 --> 46:51.917
don't scare me, brat...

46:56.126 --> 46:57.126
You know this place well

46:57.834 --> 47:00.626
You must know how to escape!

47:22.334 --> 47:22.959
Open it

47:23.334 --> 47:23.959
Ok!

47:33.209 --> 47:33.876
Go upstairs

47:33.959 --> 47:34.542
Ok

47:58.417 --> 48:00.126
You stay here and take a rest,
I'll take a look around

48:14.834 --> 48:17.417
Excuse me.
Have you seen my daughter?

48:35.417 --> 48:38.084
Excuse me.
Have you seen this little girl?

48:40.376 --> 48:41.376
She is my daughter

49:03.126 --> 49:03.959
I saw her

49:09.126 --> 49:12.417
Really? Where is she? Where is she?

49:16.167 --> 49:19.959
Where is she?
Where is she?

49:23.626 --> 49:24.417
Where is she?

49:25.917 --> 49:27.042
I don't know where she is

49:29.792 --> 49:31.959
Maybe someone took her out.
But I'm not sure

49:34.834 --> 49:35.917
She said not sure...

49:38.376 --> 49:40.251
But I believe she will be fine

49:41.251 --> 49:41.959
Thank you...

49:42.001 --> 49:43.292
She said not sure!

49:51.209 --> 49:52.251
Why did you lie to them?

49:53.376 --> 49:55.084
What if they find their daughter's body?

49:58.542 --> 49:59.626
Why are you staring at me?

50:02.042 --> 50:03.042
Why are you staring at me?

50:05.084 --> 50:07.001
Yes. I am a doctor

50:07.251 --> 50:08.584
But I'm just an Ob-gyn

50:09.126 --> 50:11.251
I save people in an operating room.
Not in a fire scene!

50:15.042 --> 50:15.917
Obviously you know

50:17.459 --> 50:18.251
If we go in

50:19.834 --> 50:21.001
we will both die

50:23.376 --> 50:24.334
I am a doctor

50:25.459 --> 50:26.626
But I'm only human

50:28.501 --> 50:29.751
I get scared too

50:33.792 --> 50:34.959
I get scared too

51:03.667 --> 51:04.584
Dong, are you crazy?

51:07.459 --> 51:09.459
We can't keep them.
We've killed...

51:10.417 --> 51:12.876
Listen to me.
We didn't kill anyone

51:13.167 --> 51:15.376
He was burnt to death.
As long as we keep our mouth shut

51:15.834 --> 51:16.667
No one would ever know

51:36.417 --> 51:37.334
I've arrived.
Where are you?

51:37.876 --> 51:38.667
Two more floors
from the refuge floor

51:39.876 --> 51:40.959
The steel reinforcements
inside the ceiling swelled

51:41.792 --> 51:42.542
The fire must be rampant upstairs

51:43.917 --> 51:44.709
There are more than 10 of us here

51:47.209 --> 51:48.459
What if others know?

51:48.792 --> 51:49.751
Ho... Ho...

51:49.792 --> 51:51.334
Just listen to me once...
We can't keep them

51:51.376 --> 51:52.334
Dong,Dong".Dong".

51:53.292 --> 51:55.626
Dong... Listen to me, listen to me...

51:55.709 --> 51:56.209
Calm down

51:57.126 --> 51:57.792
Think about...

51:58.126 --> 51:59.917
how our boss bullied us

52:00.417 --> 52:01.626
As long as we have these diamonds

52:01.917 --> 52:02.959
We have everything

52:03.376 --> 52:04.167
You think about it

52:05.667 --> 52:07.001
These will get us in trouble

52:07.042 --> 52:08.709
Dong

52:27.792 --> 52:28.501
Dad!

52:32.376 --> 52:35.001
Why are you still here?
You don't know you should leave?

52:36.292 --> 52:37.709
I came back for you!

52:51.334 --> 52:52.584
Where are you?
Are you ok?

52:53.126 --> 52:55.084
We all left the building via
the tower ladder

52:59.417 --> 53:02.251
Keung... Keung...

53:04.917 --> 53:05.584
It's...

53:08.001 --> 53:08.876
so great that you're safe

53:18.292 --> 53:19.042
Take good care of yourself

53:19.751 --> 53:22.876
I'll wait for you! I'll wait for you!

53:53.376 --> 53:55.709
(How's it?)

53:57.042 --> 53:58.626
I've told firefighters the situation

53:59.626 --> 54:00.459
They will be here in no time

54:04.126 --> 54:05.251
I don't know what you've done

54:06.584 --> 54:08.376
But if you leave,
you will be burnt to death

54:21.042 --> 54:23.084
Captain, big trouble.
Much dangerous chemical inside

54:31.959 --> 54:32.709
Don't worry

54:33.376 --> 54:34.792
Take care of yourself
and your wife first

54:41.834 --> 54:42.834
Has the chemical truck arrived?

54:43.084 --> 54:43.792
Yes, it has

54:48.251 --> 54:49.792
An occupant of the building
has turned himself in

54:50.084 --> 54:51.584
He stored dangerous goods
on refuge floor

54:51.959 --> 54:53.917
You guys have to leave now
and wait for backup support

54:54.709 --> 54:56.042
There are many people waiting
in the refuge floor

54:56.084 --> 54:56.834
t's disastrous if it explodes

54:56.959 --> 54:58.209
Any way to stop it from exploding?

54:59.292 --> 55:00.417
You can't use water

55:01.001 --> 55:02.459
Any sand bags in the office

55:03.376 --> 55:04.167
Use sand to cover it

55:05.167 --> 55:06.959
Why did you pack the chemical
in bottled water cartons...

55:07.001 --> 55:08.167
to make it through security's inspection?

55:08.334 --> 55:09.959
You know no dangerous goods are allowed here

55:31.501 --> 55:32.584
Go. Go

55:33.251 --> 55:34.251
Don't touch...

55:58.709 --> 56:01.084
Poisonous fumes... don't breathe in...
no... Go this way...

56:12.376 --> 56:13.209
Go that way

56:28.376 --> 56:29.001
Shun, are you ok?

56:29.584 --> 56:30.834
Go find our daughter...

56:32.709 --> 56:33.501
Leave now...

56:36.959 --> 56:37.626
Get down!

56:46.209 --> 56:46.917
Crawl over there!

58:11.959 --> 58:12.959
Take a rest first

58:15.126 --> 58:16.209
I'll check if there are other exits

58:24.167 --> 58:25.292
051 calling control team

58:25.959 --> 58:27.751
We are now in the last unit on 30th floor,
East Wing

58:27.959 --> 58:29.542
Hoses and tower ladders don't reach this far

58:29.792 --> 58:30.917
Requesting escape route.
Over.

59:03.126 --> 59:03.959
You cut yourself...

59:11.001 --> 59:12.542
Why didn't you save me
first just now?

59:14.917 --> 59:15.709
That question again

59:18.251 --> 59:19.626
I know you have your duty

59:24.584 --> 59:25.542
But I'm your wife...

59:28.459 --> 59:29.834
I tried my very best to protect myself

59:31.959 --> 59:33.834
just to keep our baby

59:35.917 --> 59:36.959
You don't care, do you?

59:37.834 --> 59:39.042
You don't care, right?

59:39.209 --> 59:40.042
No
Do you?

59:40.334 --> 59:41.001
No...

59:41.792 --> 59:42.501
No you don't

59:51.751 --> 59:53.501
This alarm goes off
if I stay stillfor 30 seconds...

59:54.959 --> 59:56.959
to let others know I'm in danger

59:59.667 --> 01:00:00.667
In a fire scene,
it only takes 30 seconds

01:00:02.334 --> 01:00:03.334
to lose one's life

01:00:09.917 --> 01:00:10.876
Saving life is my job

01:00:12.584 --> 01:00:13.876
I can't choose to save some over others

01:00:30.292 --> 01:00:31.334
I will take you out for sure

01:00:33.292 --> 01:00:35.709
Captain...
the tanks are out of air

01:00:39.834 --> 01:00:41.834
Send officers 1 and 2 to do a survey,
others...

01:00:43.292 --> 01:00:43.959
I've found a spot

01:00:44.334 --> 01:00:45.876
connected to the west wing if we climb up

01:00:46.167 --> 01:00:48.542
Tell your team to take victims up there

01:00:48.667 --> 01:00:49.209
How?

01:00:49.376 --> 01:00:49.917
On ropes

01:00:53.834 --> 01:00:54.334
What else can we do?

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:55.876
The tower ladder can't reach that high

01:00:56.126 --> 01:00:56.959
Your proposal doesn't work

01:00:57.376 --> 01:00:58.084
Why not?

01:00:59.126 --> 01:01:00.084
It's against your rules, right?

01:01:00.126 --> 01:01:02.042
Listen to me.
I'll take everyone out my way

01:01:04.084 --> 01:01:04.584
Listen to you?

01:01:05.667 --> 01:01:06.584
I listened and

01:01:06.626 --> 01:01:07.667
that's how our father died!

01:01:20.792 --> 01:01:22.334
We split into two teams then

01:01:24.501 --> 01:01:25.042
Captain...

01:01:26.084 --> 01:01:27.959
sent us to save the kids in a kindergarten

01:01:30.376 --> 01:01:31.084
Another team...

01:01:31.584 --> 01:01:32.667
to the elderly home to save our father

01:01:36.167 --> 01:01:37.167
I'm not convinced...

01:01:41.334 --> 01:01:43.251
he followed the rules on everything

01:01:46.251 --> 01:01:47.126
We ended up losing our father...

01:01:53.584 --> 01:01:54.167
No wonder...

01:01:56.501 --> 01:01:58.417
you two haven't met since the funeral

01:02:00.584 --> 01:02:01.209
He never mentioned it

01:02:03.167 --> 01:02:03.959
and I dared not ask...

01:02:05.876 --> 01:02:07.501
I'm ok with my father's death
being an accident

01:02:11.042 --> 01:02:12.876
But if a firefighter
doesn't get to choose

01:02:13.959 --> 01:02:14.792
I'd rather not be one

01:02:21.959 --> 01:02:22.751
No choice...

01:02:40.251 --> 01:02:41.584
051 calling control team

01:02:41.709 --> 01:02:43.167
I see a tower crane in the
construction siteacross the road

01:02:43.209 --> 01:02:44.251
We can use it to save people

01:02:55.334 --> 01:02:56.209
Are you the person in charge in here?

01:02:56.667 --> 01:02:57.501
Yes, officer

01:02:57.542 --> 01:02:59.084
We would need to use your tower crane

01:02:59.417 --> 01:03:00.334
Get someone up there
to unlock the turntable

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:01.292
and swing it

01:03:01.501 --> 01:03:02.917
to the building across the road

01:03:05.626 --> 01:03:07.834
It's possible,
if it's on manually control

01:03:08.501 --> 01:03:11.001
But the tower crane won't be
very stable on manual mode

01:03:18.917 --> 01:03:19.459
Just do it

01:03:21.501 --> 01:03:22.459
Go check out the situation
over there

01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:23.126
Yes

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:24.251
Change to manual control

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:25.292
Yes, yes...

01:03:26.167 --> 01:03:27.209
Move the crane to the south-west

01:03:27.834 --> 01:03:30.167
Yes. Pointing to that building
across the road

01:03:30.876 --> 01:03:31.626
We can try it

01:03:31.959 --> 01:03:32.959
Just be careful

01:03:33.001 --> 01:03:34.501
Copy. Everyone stand by

01:03:38.042 --> 01:03:39.709
Reporting live from the scene...

01:03:39.751 --> 01:03:43.501
a tower crane in the construction
sitenear the building on fire...

01:03:43.542 --> 01:03:45.376
slowly swings towards the building...

01:03:45.417 --> 01:03:48.001
We believe it's an emergency
measure instructed by...

01:03:48.042 --> 01:03:49.584
the firefighter who went in
the construction site

01:04:01.959 --> 01:04:02.542
He said...

01:04:05.334 --> 01:04:07.917
he wanted us to travel together

01:04:08.751 --> 01:04:11.251
He wanted us to spend more time together

01:04:41.042 --> 01:04:41.584
Stop!

01:04:45.459 --> 01:04:45.959
Attention please

01:04:46.501 --> 01:04:47.751
We crawl on the tower crane

01:04:47.792 --> 01:04:48.501
and then go down

01:04:48.876 --> 01:04:49.584
Just be careful

01:04:49.876 --> 01:04:50.584
One after another

01:04:51.001 --> 01:04:52.834
Try not to look down. Got it?

01:04:53.334 --> 01:04:53.959
Got it

01:04:54.584 --> 01:04:55.126
I'll go first

01:05:14.084 --> 01:05:15.167
Be careful...
don't be afraid...

01:05:16.251 --> 01:05:16.876
slowly...

01:05:43.459 --> 01:05:46.084
Now the firefighters are
on the crane already

01:05:46.501 --> 01:05:48.251
We believe they make use
of the crane to rescue people...

01:05:55.126 --> 01:05:57.042
Si Lok, Hold my hand. Come on

01:05:58.959 --> 01:05:59.459
Be careful

01:06:00.167 --> 01:06:00.709
Get out!

01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:03.251
Be careful, don't...

01:06:03.917 --> 01:06:04.376
Be careful

01:06:11.084 --> 01:06:11.626
Buddy Ho, help me...

01:06:11.709 --> 01:06:12.917
Don't jump!

01:06:22.042 --> 01:06:22.626
Buddy Ho...

01:06:39.376 --> 01:06:40.001
Don't jump!

01:06:40.084 --> 01:06:41.459
Buddy Ho... Help me...

01:06:41.709 --> 01:06:42.876
Buddy Ho... Help me...

01:06:48.501 --> 01:06:49.167
Dong!

01:07:05.251 --> 01:07:05.917
Tai Kwan

01:07:08.334 --> 01:07:09.751
Swing the crane back!

01:07:11.751 --> 01:07:12.709
Can't move it

01:07:16.209 --> 01:07:16.792
Catch it!

01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:27.459
I'll throw you the rope...

01:07:28.501 --> 01:07:29.126
You have to catch it...

01:07:36.376 --> 01:07:37.167
Now tie the rope on your hand

01:07:37.917 --> 01:07:40.001
I'll count to three and pull you up

01:07:42.459 --> 01:07:45.251
1, 2, 3!

01:07:49.209 --> 01:07:50.084
Hold the rope tightly!

01:08:33.792 --> 01:08:34.459
Don't let go!

01:09:01.084 --> 01:09:01.792
Pull the end!

01:09:24.292 --> 01:09:24.917
Bro...

01:09:47.959 --> 01:09:49.959
it's ok... it's ok now...

01:09:53.126 --> 01:09:54.792
Sorry... Sorry

01:10:01.959 --> 01:10:02.792
Really sorry

01:10:37.542 --> 01:10:39.792
Chief, Squadron #3 finished search
and rescue

01:10:40.251 --> 01:10:41.167
How did it go?

01:10:41.459 --> 01:10:43.501
Search and rescuefrom the 1/F
to 25/F basically a success

01:10:43.751 --> 01:10:45.792
Most victims are evacuated

01:10:47.667 --> 01:10:48.376
Well done

01:11:05.292 --> 01:11:05.959
This way

01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:21.042
Dad, are you okay?

01:11:24.459 --> 01:11:25.334
Do you feel better that way?

01:11:26.792 --> 01:11:27.917
It's trachea problem

01:11:28.376 --> 01:11:30.334
He can't inhale any more
smoke given his situation

01:11:37.667 --> 01:11:39.376
You are more familiar with this building.
How is it up there?

01:11:40.334 --> 01:11:40.834
Come to my office

01:11:41.167 --> 01:11:42.626
Our isolation system
should block the fire

01:11:43.917 --> 01:11:44.501
Let's go together

01:12:05.084 --> 01:12:06.376
Doctor, what do you need?

01:12:07.334 --> 01:12:08.459
I must operate on him now

01:12:09.792 --> 01:12:10.959
Do you have a knife? And bandage?

01:12:22.292 --> 01:12:24.917
Si Lok, the dummy has a surviving kit on it.
There is bandage inside.

01:12:30.334 --> 01:12:31.001
Disinfectant.
Ok

01:12:45.417 --> 01:12:46.001
Hello there

01:12:48.167 --> 01:12:49.584
Don't be afraid... come with me

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:53.501
Your daughter is here!

01:12:59.751 --> 01:13:00.417
Run!

01:13:15.542 --> 01:13:16.709
Lam-lam...

01:13:23.126 --> 01:13:24.542
Help...

01:13:35.209 --> 01:13:36.417
Run, Tai Kwan!

01:13:44.667 --> 01:13:46.251
Hold her down...

01:13:47.292 --> 01:13:48.001
You go on saving him...

01:13:50.126 --> 01:13:52.459
Lam-lam...

01:14:02.917 --> 01:14:05.209
save my daughter...

01:14:14.667 --> 01:14:16.042
Save them first...

01:14:28.126 --> 01:14:29.126
Help...

01:14:30.251 --> 01:14:30.876
Come on out...

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:33.376
Come out quick!

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:57.501
Go...

01:14:57.917 --> 01:14:59.042
Tai Kwan...

01:15:32.417 --> 01:15:33.084
Thank you

01:15:37.667 --> 01:15:38.376
Mommy

01:15:38.459 --> 01:15:40.917
Lam-lam, Mommy won't leave you behind

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:28.417
Move away...

01:16:46.459 --> 01:16:47.209
No...

01:16:51.834 --> 01:16:52.501
Keung...

01:16:55.042 --> 01:16:55.751
Keung...

01:17:06.876 --> 01:17:08.876
Keung... Keung...

01:17:12.292 --> 01:17:13.084
Keung...

01:17:48.751 --> 01:17:49.167
Keung...

01:17:53.501 --> 01:17:54.917
Keung, this is your brother.
Can you hear me?

01:18:10.167 --> 01:18:10.959
Keung...

01:18:13.459 --> 01:18:14.792
Keung, can you hear me?

01:18:17.251 --> 01:18:18.126
Keung!

01:18:23.209 --> 01:18:25.042
I'm fine! I'm fine!

01:18:51.667 --> 01:18:52.292
Keung

01:19:04.334 --> 01:19:05.709
How's it down there?

01:19:09.834 --> 01:19:12.376
The water here is several floors deep

01:19:13.251 --> 01:19:13.959
What do you want to do?

01:19:14.251 --> 01:19:15.542
I want dive down...

01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:17.584
and see if there is any way out

01:19:25.417 --> 01:19:26.084
But the fire is big out there

01:19:28.501 --> 01:19:29.334
The water's getting hot

01:19:30.751 --> 01:19:31.584
If it boils

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:34.209
we may miss our last chance

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:41.334
Bro

01:19:45.959 --> 01:19:46.709
Have you ever thought that...

01:19:48.751 --> 01:19:50.084
if I didn't listen to you and...

01:19:51.042 --> 01:19:52.251
went upstairs to save dad,
what would happen?

01:20:01.167 --> 01:20:02.417
Actually I knew the answer...

01:20:08.001 --> 01:20:09.167
Dad will die anyway...

01:20:25.209 --> 01:20:26.667
But I really wanted to try at least

01:20:31.084 --> 01:20:31.751
You did nothing wrong

01:20:38.376 --> 01:20:39.084
And me neither

01:20:40.834 --> 01:20:41.959
I don't want anything
bad happening to you

01:21:27.167 --> 01:21:29.459
If you can open the elevator door
on the first floor

01:21:30.834 --> 01:21:31.792
The water can put out the fire...

01:21:32.626 --> 01:21:33.917
We may have a chance to go out

01:21:35.167 --> 01:21:36.209
Not all of us are divers

01:21:36.667 --> 01:21:38.459
There are breathing masks
and air tanks in my office

01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:46.376
Think of a way to pump up
the water pressure

01:21:51.417 --> 01:21:52.459
Pour water into the elevator shaft

01:21:53.251 --> 01:21:55.209
Cut the cable and let the car fall

01:21:56.792 --> 01:21:57.959
051 calling control team

01:21:58.292 --> 01:22:01.376
Requesting all the hoses watering
the elevator shaft

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:36.376
We climb down this ladder

01:22:39.917 --> 01:22:42.042
It's so deep...
How can we do it?

01:22:45.667 --> 01:22:46.459
I'll go first

01:22:50.959 --> 01:22:51.501
Si Lok

01:22:52.251 --> 01:22:53.834
Don't look down.
Just look at the ladder

01:22:55.042 --> 01:22:56.251
You try. I'll hold you

01:22:56.459 --> 01:22:57.084
Don't worry

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:26.251
Come on. You try

01:23:29.001 --> 01:23:30.626
Don't look down.
Just look at the stairs

01:23:42.001 --> 01:23:44.334
Slowly... Careful

01:23:52.584 --> 01:23:55.001
Don't be afraid

01:23:55.751 --> 01:23:56.417
Don't be afraid

01:23:56.459 --> 01:23:58.667
Your mom is over there...

01:24:59.667 --> 01:25:00.459
Tai Kwan

01:26:05.501 --> 01:26:06.292
Si Lok!

01:26:17.209 --> 01:26:18.084
Jump!

01:26:19.792 --> 01:26:20.584
Jump!

01:26:23.709 --> 01:26:26.084
Jump everyone!
We're running out of time

01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:29.584
Si Lok! Jump now

01:26:47.292 --> 01:26:47.959
Come here!

01:26:57.084 --> 01:26:59.501
The water is very deep!
Come down now

01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:37.584
Everyone, listen.
We all dive into the water later on...

01:27:38.667 --> 01:27:39.792
and open the elevator door together

01:27:40.209 --> 01:27:41.334
And we will have a chance to go out

01:27:52.084 --> 01:27:53.751
Keung, I'll cut the cable soon

01:27:54.376 --> 01:27:56.876
Let's check the time.
Let me know when you're ready

01:27:57.542 --> 01:27:58.209
Ok

01:28:05.459 --> 01:28:06.501
Why don't you come down?

01:28:24.251 --> 01:28:25.084
What does your brother want to do?

01:28:31.042 --> 01:28:31.876
There is no choice

01:28:33.834 --> 01:28:34.792
in a fire scene at all

01:28:45.209 --> 01:28:46.042
One minute

01:29:01.251 --> 01:29:02.209
We only have one chance

01:29:02.751 --> 01:29:04.209
Take a deep breath and dive

01:29:05.084 --> 01:29:05.751
Understood?

01:29:22.501 --> 01:29:24.792
1,2,3...

01:32:21.126 --> 01:32:23.084
Lam-lam... are you ok?

01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.792
Dad

01:32:52.459 --> 01:32:53.001
Si Lok...

01:32:54.959 --> 01:32:55.542
Si Lok...

01:32:56.584 --> 01:32:57.376
Are you ok?

01:33:30.792 --> 01:33:31.584
Bro...

01:33:34.959 --> 01:33:35.626
Bro...

01:36:02.834 --> 01:36:03.751
ls everyone ok?

01:36:23.251 --> 01:36:25.084
Are you ok? Let's go

01:36:29.626 --> 01:36:30.292
What was it?

01:36:54.001 --> 01:36:55.251
Our baby is gone...

01:37:25.917 --> 01:37:26.959
Nothing is more important than you

01:37:28.876 --> 01:37:29.959
so great that you're safe

01:37:36.209 --> 01:37:37.834
From the moment I came in,
I knew I will take you out

01:37:38.792 --> 01:37:39.501
See?

01:39:30.959 --> 01:39:33.834
Where's papa?
Why hasn't papa come out?

01:41:13.292 --> 01:41:14.751
I resigned this morning

01:41:17.334 --> 01:41:17.876
Actually...

01:41:19.542 --> 01:41:21.001
you may want to think again

01:42:13.834 --> 01:42:16.167
I'm getting married.
Can you join our banquet?

01:42:16.876 --> 01:42:18.376
Sure I will

01:42:19.001 --> 01:42:19.792
Has mom known it yet?

01:42:20.376 --> 01:42:21.001
Not yet

01:42:22.917 --> 01:42:23.626
You got a phone on you?

01:42:23.667 --> 01:42:24.709
Give me your phone

01:42:25.292 --> 01:42:26.334
Mine's broken

01:42:27.305 --> 01:42:33.311
