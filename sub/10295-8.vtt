00:29.235 --> 00:31.133

00:40.369 --> 00:42.734

00:42.769 --> 00:46.501

00:46.536 --> 00:51.067

00:51.102 --> 00:55.868

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Al, I'm doing
the lottery.

01:20.035 --> 01:21.501
I need a number.

01:21.536 --> 01:22.501
Twenty-three.

01:22.536 --> 01:24.033
I don't like 23.

01:24.068 --> 01:27.033
Why? It was
your waist size...

01:27.068 --> 01:28.234
once.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.334
Come on, Al.
Give me a real number.

01:31.369 --> 01:32.734
Twenty-three
is a real number.

01:32.769 --> 01:34.133
What have you got
against 23?

01:34.168 --> 01:36.200
Well, you were born
on the 23rd

01:36.235 --> 01:38.267
and we married
on the 23rd.

01:38.302 --> 01:40.133
Seventeen.

01:40.168 --> 01:41.634
No, Kelly
already picked 17.

01:41.669 --> 01:44.100
I need something
closer to 20.

01:44.135 --> 01:46.133
Yeah, so do I.

01:46.168 --> 01:48.801
Okay, fine.
I'll pick it myself.

01:48.836 --> 01:50.801
But I'm telling
you something,

01:50.836 --> 01:53.300
when we win
the $38 million,

01:53.335 --> 01:54.801
I am keeping every penny.

01:54.836 --> 01:57.334
Yeah, you'd live
a long time, Peg.

01:57.369 --> 01:58.701
What are you reading?

01:58.736 --> 01:59.901
I'm not gonna tell you.

01:59.936 --> 02:01.334
Every time I'm
reading a magazine,

02:01.369 --> 02:03.334
and I see something
I think you might like

02:03.369 --> 02:04.767
and I say,
"Peg, look at this,"

02:04.802 --> 02:06.100
you know what you do?

02:06.135 --> 02:08.334
You take the magazine,
you look at what I showed you,

02:08.369 --> 02:09.934
then you sit down
and read the magazine

02:09.969 --> 02:11.334
and I never
get it back.

02:11.369 --> 02:13.334
Not this time.

02:13.369 --> 02:15.834
Ah, Peg,
look at this.

02:15.869 --> 02:19.167
Oh, another
fishing catalog.

02:19.202 --> 02:21.234
What am I looking at, Al?

02:21.269 --> 02:22.834
The apron that says,

02:22.869 --> 02:25.334
"He catches 'em,
I cook 'em,

02:25.369 --> 02:27.834
he eats 'em,
I love him"?

02:27.869 --> 02:30.834
You'd wear it,
but you wouldn't mean it.

02:30.869 --> 02:32.801
I was talking
about the 51/2 foot

02:32.836 --> 02:34.701
linear graphite
bait casting rod

02:34.736 --> 02:37.133
with the high-speed
star drag level wind reel.

02:37.168 --> 02:39.801
Yippy skip.

02:39.836 --> 02:41.801
And a mere $275.

02:41.836 --> 02:43.801
Oh, Al, let's buy it.

02:43.836 --> 02:47.701
We can do without food
and heat for a year.

02:47.736 --> 02:49.467
You wouldn't mind?

02:49.502 --> 02:51.300
Al, you want everything.

02:51.335 --> 02:54.100
When was the last time
you bought me something?

02:54.135 --> 02:57.167
Oh, I suppose these pots
and pans are mine.

02:58.801 --> 03:00.801
I'm sorry, Al.

03:00.836 --> 03:02.801
It's been so long
since I wore them dancing,

03:02.836 --> 03:05.701
I forgot they
were even here.

03:07.269 --> 03:08.634
I'll get it.

03:09.801 --> 03:12.167
Ooh, they have clothes
in here.

03:14.167 --> 03:15.734
Morning.
Hi, Steve.

03:15.769 --> 03:18.067
Hi, Al. Glad I caught you
before you left for work.

03:18.102 --> 03:19.434
I need a ride
home tonight.

03:19.469 --> 03:21.067
Why can't
Marcie take you?

03:21.102 --> 03:23.868
Saddle in the shop?

03:23.903 --> 03:25.934
Marcie needs the car tonight
for a women's group meeting.

03:25.969 --> 03:30.200
What do they do, all pile in
and look for men to run over?

03:30.235 --> 03:33.367
Room for one more?

03:33.402 --> 03:34.834
What do you say, Al?

03:34.869 --> 03:37.367
Ah, sure, why not.
Meet me at the store.

03:37.402 --> 03:39.033
Oh, wait a second, Steve.
I can't.

03:39.068 --> 03:40.801
I'm coming home late.
I'm playing poker tonight.

03:40.836 --> 03:42.467
Oh, gee, Al, that's great.

03:42.502 --> 03:44.934
Another night I don't get
to go out and do anything.

03:44.969 --> 03:46.067
Thank you, honey.

03:46.102 --> 03:48.634
Honey, you don't want to go out
on Friday night.

03:48.669 --> 03:51.501
Everyone and his wife
is out on Friday.

03:53.267 --> 03:56.300
Well, if it's okay with you,
I don't mind tagging along.

03:56.335 --> 03:57.501
Since we moved in, I haven't

03:57.536 --> 03:59.601
met a lot of guys in the
neighborhood, besides you.

03:59.636 --> 04:03.667
And it might be nice to meet
somebody...besides you.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.801
Fine. And you might pick
up a few pointers

04:06.836 --> 04:09.868
watching
the old master play.

04:09.903 --> 04:12.868
Oh, yeah. Why don't you
ask the old master

04:12.903 --> 04:14.834
about the time
they picked him so clean,

04:14.869 --> 04:18.367
he had to push
the old car home.

04:18.402 --> 04:20.934
Peg, now, I was off
my game that night.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.133
I was nervous, I couldn't
concentrate on my cards

04:23.168 --> 04:25.434
what with you
being in the hospital

04:25.469 --> 04:26.667
having Bud and all.

04:26.702 --> 04:28.467
This time will
be different.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.934
This time
I have a goal.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.334
See, all the money
that I make

04:31.369 --> 04:33.133
is gonna go towards
that fishing rod and reel.

04:33.168 --> 04:35.334
You ought to see it, Steve.
Peg, give me the catalog.

04:35.369 --> 04:36.834
I'm reading it, Al.

04:36.869 --> 04:38.834
You ought to see it.

04:38.869 --> 04:41.834
It's great, Steve,
and it's only $275.

04:41.869 --> 04:43.767
Al...

04:43.802 --> 04:46.300
This is none of my
business or anything,

04:46.335 --> 04:48.801
but if you really
want something,

04:48.836 --> 04:51.801
I've found the best way
to get it is through saving.

04:51.836 --> 04:54.801
At the bank we have
a little saying:

04:54.836 --> 04:56.968
"If you want
to save money...

04:57.003 --> 04:59.968
Save money."

05:00.003 --> 05:01.834
Thank you, Steve.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.901
You're so much wiser than all
the other tellers I've met.

05:06.767 --> 05:08.968
All except
the automated ones.

05:10.834 --> 05:12.901
I'm not gonna be
a teller for long.

05:12.936 --> 05:15.267
You may laugh at me-
And I do.

05:15.302 --> 05:17.501
but I have a way
with money.

05:17.536 --> 05:19.501
I know how to save,
I know how to invest

05:19.536 --> 05:21.133
and I know how
to make money grow.

05:21.168 --> 05:22.701
Give me five dollars,

05:22.736 --> 05:27.000
and I can find opportunities
other people miss with hundreds.

05:27.035 --> 05:31.100
Yeah, give Al five dollars and
you've just cashed his paycheck.

05:33.367 --> 05:36.868
Yeah. Anybody been
to Gus' Diner lately?

05:36.903 --> 05:38.868
The new waitress.

05:38.903 --> 05:41.167
Yeah, like, what is she,
man, like 25?

05:41.202 --> 05:42.567
Yeah, it's
a great age.

05:42.602 --> 05:44.567
Just before
their butts start to sag

05:44.602 --> 05:47.400
and they start
wearing Reeboks.

05:47.435 --> 05:49.467
Bet a dollar.

05:49.502 --> 05:51.200
She's perfect.

05:51.235 --> 05:53.200
She's great,
but not perfect.

05:53.235 --> 05:55.701
Her eyes are a little
too close together.

05:55.736 --> 05:58.367
They're vacant enough,
but they're not perfect.

05:59.701 --> 06:01.434
Pair of queens bets.

06:01.469 --> 06:02.868
Yeah, if you want
a perfect woman

06:02.903 --> 06:04.367
you gotta build her
in your head.

06:04.402 --> 06:06.200
It gives you something
to do

06:06.235 --> 06:08.234
when you're
making love to your wife.

06:09.701 --> 06:11.501
I like that Connie Chung.

06:13.868 --> 06:16.868
I like Connie Mack, too,

06:16.903 --> 06:20.300
but neither one have any
place in this conversation.

06:20.335 --> 06:22.300
Now, for the
perfect woman...

06:22.335 --> 06:24.534
Let's start out
with...the legs.

06:24.569 --> 06:25.968
Catherine Bach.

06:26.003 --> 06:27.701
I'd say Tina Turner.

06:27.736 --> 06:30.334
A little too
muscular for me.

06:30.369 --> 06:32.567
Jamie Lee Curtis.

06:32.602 --> 06:34.834
Ah!
Ah!

06:34.869 --> 06:36.834
Okay, now
let's talk tush.

06:36.869 --> 06:38.334
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

06:38.369 --> 06:39.501
Sigourney Weaver.

06:39.536 --> 06:42.267
Nope, nope.
Monster touched it.

06:44.467 --> 06:46.834
Jamie Lee
Curtis.

06:46.869 --> 06:48.901
Ah!
Ah!

06:48.936 --> 06:50.901
Okay, it's hooter time.

06:50.936 --> 06:52.100
My favorite.

06:52.135 --> 06:53.300
My time, baby.

06:53.335 --> 06:55.033
Jacqueline Big-set.

06:55.068 --> 06:57.634
A young Brigitte Bardot.

06:57.669 --> 07:00.033
Ah!
Ah!

07:00.068 --> 07:02.100
Now that's
our perfect woman.

07:02.135 --> 07:04.634
Nope. Got
to have a brain.

07:04.669 --> 07:06.434
Why?
A brain?

07:11.501 --> 07:13.367
Vanna White!
Vanna White!

07:17.801 --> 07:19.434
I fold.

07:19.469 --> 07:21.033
$5.00.

07:21.068 --> 07:22.033
I'm out.

07:22.068 --> 07:23.567
You're bluffing,
Barney.

07:23.602 --> 07:25.734
Al, he's got
two pair showing.

07:25.769 --> 07:27.234
E.J.'s got his 10

07:27.269 --> 07:29.234
and both queens
are gone.

07:29.269 --> 07:32.968
No way he's got
that third 10.

07:33.003 --> 07:34.901
I call.

07:34.936 --> 07:37.033
Say hi
to the third 10.

07:40.534 --> 07:42.767
I'm getting another beer.
Who wants one?

07:42.802 --> 07:45.767
You've given me
enough already, Al.

07:47.802 --> 07:49.267
Russ here.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.133
Gee, Al, you stink.

07:52.767 --> 07:54.267
Thanks a lot, pal.

07:54.302 --> 07:57.267
Come on. I can't believe
you are losing to these guys.

07:57.302 --> 07:58.667
I've only been watching
for an hour,

07:58.702 --> 08:00.467
I got the whole rhythm
of the game down.

08:00.502 --> 08:01.534
What rhythm?

08:01.569 --> 08:02.667
It's pretty obvious.

08:02.702 --> 08:06.300
Take Russ.
Whenever he's got a bad hand,

08:06.335 --> 08:09.033
he shuffles his hole card as if
he thinks it's gonna change.

08:09.068 --> 08:11.634
Whenever Barney bluffs,
he taps his chips.

08:11.669 --> 08:13.701
Dead giveaway.
Norris? He never bluffs.

08:13.736 --> 08:16.801
He won't stay in the game
unless he's got three of a kind.

08:16.836 --> 08:18.601
And you, Al. You stink.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.734
Gee, Steve, you're a real
Cincinnati kid.

08:22.769 --> 08:26.234
I think he walked home
after a game too.

08:26.269 --> 08:29.267
If we're such suckers,
why don't you sit in?

08:29.302 --> 08:31.300
Oh, no. I just cash
my paycheck

08:31.335 --> 08:33.000
and I give that money
to Marcie.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.234
The mortgage
is due Monday.

08:34.269 --> 08:35.634
Besides,
I don't gamble.

08:35.669 --> 08:38.634
Steve, we're married men.
We all gamble.

08:40.267 --> 08:42.267
I got to run, guys.

08:42.302 --> 08:45.067
Uh...wife is real sick.

08:45.102 --> 08:46.868
Ah, bull!
Listen to this!

08:46.903 --> 08:48.234
Where are you going?

08:48.269 --> 08:49.868
Come on, come on.
What is it?

08:49.903 --> 08:54.234
I promised my wife
I'd take her to the ballet.

08:59.868 --> 09:02.734
The ballet, huh?
Better take Norris along.

09:02.769 --> 09:03.968
Show them what you do

09:04.003 --> 09:05.868
when they're up in the air
doing those splits.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:18.234 --> 09:21.167
It's up to you, Steve.

09:21.202 --> 09:22.400
Uh, excuse me.

09:22.435 --> 09:24.868
Oh, uh, look,
I'm not playing.

09:24.903 --> 09:27.100
I don't believe
in gambling.

09:37.534 --> 09:38.767
I'm in.

09:40.868 --> 09:42.934
Sure you wouldn't
like some cake or something?

09:42.969 --> 09:44.434
No, thanks.

09:44.469 --> 09:47.400
After our meeting, we stopped
at Gus' Diner for a bite.

09:47.435 --> 09:50.400
They have the dumbest
waitress I've ever seen,

09:50.435 --> 09:52.901
wiggling around
in this short skirt,

09:52.936 --> 09:55.033
as if anyone was looking.

09:55.068 --> 09:58.067
She got our orders wrong,
she got our change wrong.

09:58.102 --> 10:00.567
Thank God our club president
had enough nerve to complain

10:00.602 --> 10:02.400
and get her fired.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.901
What are you doing?

10:06.936 --> 10:09.400
Oh, Al was admiring
this fishing rod this morning.

10:09.435 --> 10:12.400
So when he comes in
broke from poker,

10:12.435 --> 10:14.400
I like
to leave it out,

10:14.435 --> 10:15.901
you know,
just to remind him

10:15.936 --> 10:18.934
of yet another thing
he'll never get.

10:18.969 --> 10:21.434
I hope they
get home soon.

10:21.469 --> 10:23.467
Steve and I usually go over
our budget tonight.

10:23.502 --> 10:25.367
It's getting late.
Maybe we should call.

10:25.402 --> 10:27.968
Mm. We can't. Al says
there's no phone there.

10:30.868 --> 10:33.868
Well, I'm glad Steve's out
having a good time.

10:33.903 --> 10:35.868
I know he doesn't
gamble or anything,

10:35.903 --> 10:38.367
but it's good that he's out
there trying to meet new people.

10:38.402 --> 10:41.234
Maybe he'll invite some of
the guys over to our house.

10:41.269 --> 10:42.868
Ha, ha. Oh, yeah.

10:42.903 --> 10:45.367
That would make for quite
a stimulating evening.

10:45.402 --> 10:48.367
I wonder which one
he'll bring home.

10:48.402 --> 10:49.534
Let's see.

10:49.569 --> 10:51.567
There's Norris,
who can make

10:51.602 --> 10:53.567
obscene sounds
with his armpit.

10:53.602 --> 10:56.501
He is naturally
a welcome guest

10:56.536 --> 10:58.400
at any occasion.

10:58.435 --> 10:59.901
Oh, and then
there's Barney,

10:59.936 --> 11:02.400
the man no deodorant
could tame.

11:02.435 --> 11:05.901
And if you're
really lucky,

11:05.936 --> 11:07.901
you'll get Russ,
the invincible.

11:07.936 --> 11:11.267
He hasn't met a toilet yet
he couldn't overflow.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.434
Poor Steve.

11:18.901 --> 11:22.334
Yeah. These guys are
a real bunch of losers.

11:22.369 --> 11:24.834
Well, then, Steve will just
have to find friends elsewhere.

11:24.869 --> 11:27.868
Because if there's
one thing my Steve is,

11:27.903 --> 11:29.400
it's a winner.

11:30.868 --> 11:32.868
How you doing,
Steve?

11:32.903 --> 11:35.367
Are you okay?

11:35.402 --> 11:36.868
Come on, Steve.

11:36.903 --> 11:39.868
You had a good time,
you met some good people...

11:39.903 --> 11:43.567
and you lost $300
to a good friend.

11:48.133 --> 11:50.901
I can't believe I lost my share
of the mortgage payment.

11:50.936 --> 11:52.133
What am I gonna
tell Marcie?

11:52.168 --> 11:55.734
Steve, you're a man.
Lie like a dog.

11:55.769 --> 11:59.000
Tell her you got mugged.
We got jumped by four guys.

11:59.035 --> 12:00.267
I fought off three,

12:00.302 --> 12:02.033
but the little guy
beat you silly

12:02.068 --> 12:04.100
and took your money.

12:04.135 --> 12:06.067
You're enjoying this,
aren't you, Al?

12:06.102 --> 12:09.100
Well, you're the one had
the rhythm of the game.

12:09.135 --> 12:12.234
Wasn't my fault you couldn't
stop mouthing your hole card.

12:12.269 --> 12:14.467
I gotta tell
her the truth.

12:14.502 --> 12:15.534
I got no choice.

12:15.569 --> 12:16.834
Well, I wouldn't.

12:16.869 --> 12:18.267
I have to.
She's gonna ask.

12:18.302 --> 12:19.634
Here's what I do.

12:19.669 --> 12:22.100
I walk in the door,
before Peg can say a word-

12:22.135 --> 12:23.734
which means
I gotta be quick-

12:23.769 --> 12:25.467
I tell her
how great she looks.

12:25.502 --> 12:26.601
Then if it's real rough,

12:26.636 --> 12:28.767
I grit my teeth
and throw her a quick one.

12:28.802 --> 12:31.801
She's so grateful, she forgets
what she's gonna ask me,

12:31.836 --> 12:34.667
and even if she says something
later on, I'm asleep.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.634
Can't do it.

12:40.669 --> 12:42.934
Our relationship
is based on honesty.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.434
And the buns
of Mel Gibson.

12:49.469 --> 12:50.467
Ooh!

12:52.400 --> 12:54.934
That is our
perfect man.

12:54.969 --> 12:56.934
Wait,
we need a brain.

12:56.969 --> 12:58.901
Why? It's a man.

13:01.367 --> 13:03.701
Hi, honey!

13:03.736 --> 13:04.868
Steve!

13:04.903 --> 13:06.901
I was worried
about you.

13:06.936 --> 13:09.234
Did you have
a good time?

13:09.269 --> 13:10.901
Well, you know...

13:10.936 --> 13:12.400
Kinda...
you know...

13:12.435 --> 13:13.767
Considering...

13:14.901 --> 13:16.267
Oh.

13:16.302 --> 13:19.501
Well, I'm sure it was hard
on you being the only one there

13:19.536 --> 13:21.234
with the strength
not to gamble.

13:26.767 --> 13:28.100
Marcie...

13:28.135 --> 13:30.167
I have to tell you
something.

13:36.601 --> 13:38.801
You look
beautiful.

13:38.836 --> 13:41.801
More beautiful than
I've ever seen you.

13:41.836 --> 13:43.968
Oh, Steve.

13:44.003 --> 13:47.834
Your lips are like wine,
and I want to get drunk tonight.

13:51.567 --> 13:52.734
Badly.

13:52.769 --> 13:55.234
But Steve, we need
to finish our budget.

13:55.269 --> 13:58.400
Damn the budget!
A man has needs.

13:58.435 --> 13:59.501
Oh, Steve!

14:07.734 --> 14:10.734
Has all this talk done
something for you, Al?

14:10.769 --> 14:13.634
Yeah. I'm thirsty.
Get me a beer.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.100
Oh, Al.

14:17.135 --> 14:19.100
So how'd you do
tonight?

14:19.135 --> 14:20.601
Lose as usual?

14:20.636 --> 14:21.767
Yeah.

14:21.802 --> 14:22.934
Oh, darn.

14:22.969 --> 14:25.934
Now you won't
be able to buy

14:25.969 --> 14:28.434
that beautiful fishing
pole you wanted.

14:33.934 --> 14:35.934
When will I ever learn?

14:41.100 --> 14:42.267
No!

14:42.302 --> 14:44.767
Look, you don't
seem to understand me.

14:44.802 --> 14:47.801
I want something that
goes with this dress.

14:48.968 --> 14:50.467
A bubbling caldron?

14:52.067 --> 14:54.934
You've got a lot
of nerve.

14:54.969 --> 14:58.434
I need it to get
this close to your feet.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.801
Uh...hi, Al.

15:07.836 --> 15:09.200
Hi, Steve.
How's it going?

15:09.235 --> 15:11.534
Hey, did Marcie ever
bring up the budget again?

15:11.569 --> 15:13.033
Yes, Al, she did.

15:13.068 --> 15:14.534
And every time she did,

15:14.569 --> 15:17.901
I told her how
beautiful she looked.

15:17.936 --> 15:19.467
And showed her.

15:20.767 --> 15:23.634
I showed her till
8:00 this morning, Al.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.968
She's out cold,

15:27.003 --> 15:29.601
and I don't remember
how I got here.

15:29.636 --> 15:31.601
Then it worked.

15:31.636 --> 15:33.968
Yeah, but I'm afraid
it'll never work again, Al.

15:39.067 --> 15:41.000
I don't know how
to ask you this,

15:41.035 --> 15:43.067
but I gotta ask you
for a big favor.

15:43.102 --> 15:44.534
Whoa, Steve, I can't!

15:44.569 --> 15:45.868
She's your wife!

15:47.567 --> 15:49.801
I don't like
touching mine.

15:52.434 --> 15:55.434
Al, I know this is something
that isn't normally done,

15:55.469 --> 16:00.200
but I was wondering if you could
kind of give me my money back.

16:00.235 --> 16:02.200
Wait a second.
This is over the line.

16:02.235 --> 16:03.701
Okay. How about this?

16:03.736 --> 16:05.501
Just loan it to me.

16:05.536 --> 16:08.100
You're just gonna take it back
to the poker game next week

16:08.135 --> 16:09.901
and lose it,
because you stink.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.067
I stink? I tell you
what we'll do, Steve.

16:12.102 --> 16:13.400
You're real good
with money.

16:13.435 --> 16:15.434
You know how to invest it
and make it grow.

16:15.469 --> 16:17.434
How much was it
you said you needed

16:17.469 --> 16:20.434
to find those opportunities
other people miss?

16:20.469 --> 16:21.567
$300, Al.

16:21.602 --> 16:23.701
No, it was
$5.00, Steve.

16:23.736 --> 16:25.167
Make it grow, buddy.

16:26.767 --> 16:28.968
This is how
you treat me?

16:29.003 --> 16:30.534
This is how you treat
a neighbor,

16:30.569 --> 16:31.901
a man who calls you friend?

16:31.936 --> 16:33.334
Yes, it is, Steve.

16:33.369 --> 16:34.934
Give me the 5.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.767
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

16:37.802 --> 16:40.634
I need a plan.
Let's see.

16:40.669 --> 16:42.634
I work in a bank.
If I took a quarter

16:42.669 --> 16:43.667
out of every
quarter roll...

16:43.702 --> 16:45.167
Why don't you do this?

16:45.202 --> 16:47.234
Why don't you go home,
wake up Marcie,

16:47.269 --> 16:50.734
say, "I lost all my money.
I screwed up.

16:50.769 --> 16:52.734
I'm sorry.
What's for dinner?"

16:52.769 --> 16:55.734
That's what being
a man's all about, Steve.

16:55.769 --> 16:57.601
Making mistakes
and not caring.

16:59.133 --> 17:00.934
Well, I do care, Al.

17:00.969 --> 17:04.300
Excuse me. Could you
spare some change

17:04.335 --> 17:06.666
for a decent meal?

17:09.166 --> 17:10.467
Thank you.

17:10.502 --> 17:11.800
Hey,
wait a minute.

17:14.666 --> 17:15.834
Thanks.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.334
Thanks a lot.

17:17.368 --> 17:18.267
Sure.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.099
Well, Steve, you're
a real decent guy.

17:22.135 --> 17:24.968
You're about as sharp
as a bag of wet hair,

17:25.002 --> 17:27.099
but you're a decent guy.

17:27.135 --> 17:28.400
You know, Al,

17:28.435 --> 17:30.567
that $5.00 wasn't going
to do anything for me,

17:30.602 --> 17:33.501
but it'll do a lot
of good for him.

17:36.167 --> 17:37.701
You see...

17:37.736 --> 17:39.200
I believe
something, Al.

17:39.235 --> 17:42.200
I believe that if you
do something good,

17:42.235 --> 17:46.367
something good will always
happen to you in return.

17:46.402 --> 17:48.200
You'll see, Al.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.601
You'll see.

18:03.133 --> 18:06.901
Steve, it's been real nice
having you here all day.

18:08.901 --> 18:10.801
So, uh, as the hostess here,

18:10.836 --> 18:12.834
I guess it's up
to me to ask...

18:12.869 --> 18:15.968
What are you doing here?

18:16.003 --> 18:18.000
Waiting for something
good to happen.

18:18.035 --> 18:19.367
And it will too.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.434
I walked around
most of the morning.

18:21.469 --> 18:22.734
Nothing good happened.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.234
But I know that when Al
gets home,

18:25.269 --> 18:27.801
something good
is gonna happen.

18:27.836 --> 18:29.901
Well, that'll be a first.

18:29.936 --> 18:32.901
You know, I haven't seen
Marcie all day.

18:32.936 --> 18:34.767
Is she okay?

18:34.802 --> 18:37.133
Sure. I did
all the work.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.200
Are you okay?

18:42.235 --> 18:43.367
Oh, yeah.
Everything's fine.

18:43.402 --> 18:45.868
Marcie decided
to sleep in today,

18:45.903 --> 18:50.167
And me...I'm happy
as a duck in orange sauce.

18:50.202 --> 18:52.167
Oh, Marcie's light
just came on.

18:52.202 --> 18:53.534
She must be up.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.133
Peg, listen very
carefully to me.

19:01.267 --> 19:06.200
I lost my paycheck
to Al in the poker game.

19:06.235 --> 19:08.534
He won't
give it back.

19:08.569 --> 19:10.033
Marcie's gonna
kill me,

19:10.068 --> 19:12.133
if she
hasn't already.

19:16.634 --> 19:18.901
How much did he win?

19:18.936 --> 19:20.467
$300. Oh.

19:20.502 --> 19:23.968
I haven't had a new
bra for two years,

19:24.003 --> 19:27.701
and that baboon
is sitting on 300 bucks?

19:27.736 --> 19:30.634
I'm gonna have to tell Marcie.
It's the right thing to do.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.501
Yeah, you go tell Marcie,
and then bring her over here.

19:33.536 --> 19:34.801
Al will be home soon,

19:34.836 --> 19:36.667
and believe me,
you'll get your money back.

19:36.702 --> 19:38.434
I'll see to that.

19:38.469 --> 19:40.167
Really?

19:40.202 --> 19:41.734
Oh, thank you, Peggy.
Thank you.

19:41.769 --> 19:42.901
See?

19:42.936 --> 19:45.300
I knew something good
was gonna happen.

19:47.167 --> 19:50.701
So you lost again
at poker, huh, Al?

19:50.736 --> 19:53.634
So I can buy a new bra

19:53.669 --> 19:56.200
when we can afford it,
huh, Al?

19:56.235 --> 19:57.567
Enjoy Daddy's dinner.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.767
Hi.

20:05.033 --> 20:06.100
What's for supper?

20:06.135 --> 20:07.367
Filthy pig!

20:07.402 --> 20:09.534
We had that last night.

20:11.367 --> 20:15.467
Al, Steve told me that you won
his money in the poker game.

20:15.502 --> 20:17.367
You cannot
keep the money.

20:17.402 --> 20:20.033
Where did this rule
come from?

20:20.068 --> 20:22.033
When I lose, I lose.

20:22.068 --> 20:24.767
You don't play cards and then
sit down and when it's finished

20:24.802 --> 20:26.701
you say, "Hey, give me
my money back."

20:26.736 --> 20:27.901
That's no fun.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.334
If that's
the way it worked,

20:29.369 --> 20:31.868
I may as well
stay home with you.

20:31.903 --> 20:33.801
You know, it's bad enough

20:33.836 --> 20:35.701
you lied to me
about winning the money,

20:35.736 --> 20:38.868
but, Al, these are
the only friends I've got.

20:38.903 --> 20:40.667
I like having people
to talk to.

20:40.702 --> 20:43.067
You know, people that will
come over to the house

20:43.102 --> 20:45.367
even though you're here.

20:45.402 --> 20:47.367
That makes them
special, Al.

20:47.402 --> 20:51.267
Now, I want you to give him
back his money, for me.

20:51.302 --> 20:52.968
I can't. I spent it.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.734
Oh, Al, you are
the lowest!

20:54.769 --> 20:57.334
Now, what did you waste
that money on?

20:58.534 --> 21:00.200
I got you this.

21:00.235 --> 21:02.367
Ohh!

21:02.402 --> 21:04.534
Oh, Al!

21:04.569 --> 21:06.033
It's beautiful.

21:06.068 --> 21:07.534
I love it.

21:07.569 --> 21:10.033
Oh, honey, I don't
deserve this.

21:10.068 --> 21:14.534
I felt kind of bad about
not ever getting you anything.

21:14.569 --> 21:18.367
Oh, you are
the sweetest man...

21:18.402 --> 21:19.868
in the whole world.

21:19.903 --> 21:23.367
Now, honey, I'm just gonna go
upstairs and try this on,

21:23.402 --> 21:26.200
and then I'll come make you
a nice juicy steak,

21:26.235 --> 21:28.501
just like the dog had.

21:43.634 --> 21:46.133
Oh, it's
priceless, Al!

21:46.168 --> 21:48.334
No. It was 15 bucks.

21:50.234 --> 21:53.567
But you, my love,
were 275.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.033
Peg, I'll be down
in the basement!

21:58.068 --> 21:59.067
Okay, honey!

22:02.601 --> 22:04.934
You better get
that money back!

22:04.969 --> 22:06.767
It's all
taken care of.

22:16.434 --> 22:18.801
Al? Peggy?

22:20.167 --> 22:22.300
Ha, ha...

22:25.200 --> 22:26.234
Guys?

22:27.534 --> 22:28.868
It's me!

22:31.868 --> 22:33.601
Where's our money,
Steven?

22:34.734 --> 22:36.734
Marcie!

22:36.769 --> 22:38.100
You look beautiful!

22:39.305 --> 22:45.218
