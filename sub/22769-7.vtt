00:07.380 --> 00:10.670
Fred:
San Fransokyo Museum of Art.
All is quiet.

00:10.670 --> 00:12.420
For now.

00:12.420 --> 00:14.500
Hiro:
Fred, why are we staking out
an art party?

00:14.500 --> 00:16.120
-What could happen?
-Everything!

00:16.120 --> 00:17.500
Museum galas are like
in the top three

00:17.500 --> 00:19.420
favorite supervillain things
to interrupt.

00:19.420 --> 00:22.080
Right after big parades
and experimental weapon
demonstrations.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.380
Baymax:
Who or what
is a Shimamoto?

00:28.380 --> 00:31.380
Lenore Shimamoto.
She was an amazing artist,
and kind of my idol.

00:31.380 --> 00:33.540
-Never heard of her.
- She painted "City Rising,"

00:33.540 --> 00:35.670
the famous masterpiece
they're unveiling tonight.

00:35.670 --> 00:38.540
-Never heard of it.
-Oh! That's because it was lost
for like a hundred years.

00:38.540 --> 00:40.500
Still never heard of it.

00:40.500 --> 00:44.460
It captures a city's rebirth
after the Great Catastrophe
of 1906.

00:44.460 --> 00:47.540
I'm a huge fan.
Not of the catastrophe.

00:47.540 --> 00:50.250
That was--
That was terrible.
Of Shimamoto.

00:50.250 --> 00:54.330
-(crash and screaming)
-The gala is under attack
by an inhuman freak!

00:54.330 --> 00:55.580
Out of my way!

00:55.580 --> 00:57.330
Inhuman freak?
What the--?

00:57.330 --> 01:01.960
Aaah, ah, ah, ah, aah-- Ohh!
There's the floor!

01:03.250 --> 01:06.330
Super-villain!
Totally called it.

Darn it!

01:43.750 --> 01:46.420
Hiro:
You know, I don't know
if I'd call Globby "super."

01:46.420 --> 01:47.620
Maybe "sub-par."

01:47.620 --> 01:48.790
Well, "sub-par-villain"
isn't a thing,

01:48.790 --> 01:50.120
so what am I
supposed to say?

01:50.120 --> 01:53.040
Oh, there should be
a warning on that skylight.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.040
"Glass may shatter"!

01:55.040 --> 01:56.210
Time out, guys.

01:56.210 --> 01:57.790
Really appreciate this.

01:57.790 --> 02:00.580
You guys are lookin' sharp,
by the way.

02:00.580 --> 02:01.620
Sub-par villain.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.540
Baymax:
Broken glass can be hazardous.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.420
Fine. We'll wait.

02:05.420 --> 02:09.380
Okay.
Time in on three.
One, two--

02:10.920 --> 02:12.000
Psych!

02:17.710 --> 02:20.500
-Baymax, go!
-He did not finish counting.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.670
Technically, it is still
time out.

02:22.670 --> 02:23.830
Okay, three, go!

02:24.920 --> 02:27.460
Fred:
Hey, no fair!
You said time out!

02:31.120 --> 02:33.750
Honey Lemon:
We have to protect
the paintings!

02:33.750 --> 02:35.620
Fred: Ha!
Fredzilla to the rescue!

02:35.620 --> 02:37.920
(blast)

02:37.920 --> 02:40.080
Okay!
So I did that.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.120
(blast)

02:46.120 --> 02:47.420
Hiro:
Fire and paintings--
bad combo!

02:47.420 --> 02:48.580
Right!
Good call.

02:49.710 --> 02:51.920
Anti-sticky ball ready!

02:51.920 --> 02:53.040
Hah!

02:53.040 --> 02:54.170
Globby:
Hey!

02:54.170 --> 02:55.620
Aah!

02:55.620 --> 02:57.580
-Yes!
-Ooh! Ooh-ooh!

02:57.580 --> 02:59.880
(gasp)
I'm holding "City Rising"!

02:59.880 --> 03:02.420
You talkin'
about the famous painting?
I've heard of that.

03:04.670 --> 03:06.500
Baymax:
Do not move.
You could be injured

03:06.500 --> 03:08.580
from your fall.
I will scan you now.

03:08.580 --> 03:11.000
Don't worry, Baymax.
They can take care of him,
in jail.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.460
Jail.
They don't even make pants
that can hold me!

03:14.460 --> 03:15.620
Yoink!

03:16.500 --> 03:19.540
Boing boing boing,
everybody! Bye!

03:20.710 --> 03:22.920
Fred:
Wait, he can turn
into a ball?

03:22.920 --> 03:24.420
That's new!

03:25.540 --> 03:27.380
-Ha!
-(bang)

03:28.670 --> 03:29.540
Darn it!

03:33.040 --> 03:35.710
-Globby's back?
-And you let him get away?

03:35.710 --> 03:37.420
We saved the painting,
let's focus on that.

03:37.420 --> 03:40.120
The very famous painting?
Perhaps you've heard of it?

03:40.120 --> 03:43.920
Guess what I made!
Breakfast Nachos el Diablo!

03:43.920 --> 03:47.500
Breakfast nachos?
The unbalanced part
of a balanced breakfast.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.380
So what were you guys
doing out so late last night?

03:49.380 --> 03:52.040
-We-- Um--
-Baymax:
We were at the museum.

03:53.540 --> 03:57.620
(breathing heavily)
Caliente!
Muy caliente!

03:57.620 --> 03:58.790
Smooth.

03:58.790 --> 03:59.960
Whoa!

03:59.960 --> 04:02.040
(beeping)
Hiro, this is your reminder

04:02.040 --> 04:03.880
that you have a school project

04:03.880 --> 04:05.000
due today

04:05.000 --> 04:08.460
that is currently...
10 percent finished.

04:08.460 --> 04:11.500
What?
Shouldn't you have been
doing homework last night?

04:11.500 --> 04:12.580
Here, at home?

04:12.580 --> 04:14.290
The work?

04:14.290 --> 04:16.670
Aunt Cass,
don't worry, it's me.
I'll improvise.

04:16.670 --> 04:18.580
-You mean scramble?
-At the last minute.

04:18.580 --> 04:20.460
Always worked in high school.

04:20.460 --> 04:23.710
Professor Granville:
All right, everyone. Settle.

04:23.710 --> 04:27.000
Good morning.
I hope you've used
your three weeks wisely

04:27.000 --> 04:28.920
for this seismic project.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.580
Totally wisely.

04:30.580 --> 04:33.670
My prototype
uses nickel titanium
as a shape memory alloy,

04:33.670 --> 04:36.120
which allows it
to have increased plasticity
under pressure.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.830
Very good, Karmi.

04:37.830 --> 04:39.960
Now let's shake it
and break it.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.460
Our goal is
to withstand a 9.0 or greater
on the Richter scale.

04:47.460 --> 04:50.750
-(beeping)
-Mmmm...?

04:50.750 --> 04:53.540
(vibrating)

04:55.960 --> 04:57.170
(breaking)

04:57.170 --> 04:58.580
Ugh!

04:58.580 --> 05:01.580
8.5. Impressive.

05:01.580 --> 05:04.710
But Karmi, I am confident
you can do better.

05:04.710 --> 05:07.580
Let's see version 2.0 next week.

05:07.580 --> 05:09.500
Your turn, Mr. Hamada.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.210
Elastomer dampers.

05:11.210 --> 05:13.710
Is the paint still wet
on your model?

05:13.710 --> 05:16.040
No!
That would imply
I threw it together

05:16.040 --> 05:17.710
at the--
last possible minute.

05:17.710 --> 05:22.250
Perhaps your design
will save our city from
the next Great Catastrophe.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.790
(vibrating)

05:24.790 --> 05:26.620
Ah!

05:26.620 --> 05:28.170
Or not.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.330
Ahh!

05:32.330 --> 05:33.710
Haha...

05:33.710 --> 05:35.710
And scene.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.000
Amazing.
And we saved it!

05:38.000 --> 05:40.920
I do not understand
the purpose of-- art.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.540
Well, to create art
is to be human.

05:43.540 --> 05:44.620
To be alive.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.670
I am neither.

05:46.670 --> 05:48.380
Oh.
I'm sorry.

05:48.380 --> 05:50.080
I mean, how can I put this
so you'll, um--

05:50.080 --> 05:51.790
It can be, you know,
really good,

05:51.790 --> 05:54.750
for emotional health,
like art therapy.

05:54.750 --> 05:57.790
I am coded to expand
my therapeutic capabilities.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.830
Perhaps I should
increase my understanding
of-- art.

06:00.830 --> 06:01.960
Ooh, I can teach you!

06:01.960 --> 06:04.750
To me, art is
about expressing
your feelings.

06:04.750 --> 06:07.290
-Do you mean, like this?
-(beeping)

06:07.290 --> 06:09.500
-Hm, not exactly.
-(door opens)

06:10.620 --> 06:12.960
(screams)
Hiro, what happened?

06:12.960 --> 06:15.000
Hiro is covered in red paint.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.250
Do not be alarmed.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.710
This red paint
is non-toxic.

06:18.710 --> 06:21.500
So I guess your demo
wasn't a masterpiece?

06:21.500 --> 06:22.710
More of a disaster-piece.

06:22.710 --> 06:24.880
Hey, check out
this funny video
I found!

06:24.880 --> 06:27.580
Uh, Fred, that's me.

06:27.580 --> 06:29.790
Hey! That is you!

06:29.790 --> 06:31.670
Maybe just try to imagine
it's another guy!

06:31.670 --> 06:33.710
See?
Now you're laughing.

06:33.710 --> 06:35.580
Wait.
That's a grimace.
I'm sorry.

06:35.580 --> 06:39.210
It's okay, Hiro.
We learn more from our failures
than our successes.

06:39.210 --> 06:41.380
Uh, you know what?
It's no big deal.

06:41.380 --> 06:44.210
I've got a ton of better ideas.
I'll just do one of those.

06:44.210 --> 06:45.670
The better ones.

06:45.670 --> 06:46.620
Optimism.

06:48.380 --> 06:50.960
Check it out:
A maglev base
isolation system.

06:53.670 --> 06:56.120
Yep.
That's what I did
when I was a freshman.

06:57.670 --> 06:58.750
(model hits floor)

07:06.380 --> 07:09.330
And when any fractures appear,
they're instantly filled

07:09.330 --> 07:11.580
by a quick-drying
but flexible foam.

07:11.580 --> 07:13.500
(gasp)
That's wonderful, Hiro!

07:13.500 --> 07:17.000
I'm sure it's super different
than when I did that same
exact thing.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.750
Huuh!

07:18.750 --> 07:19.920
(thud)

07:25.830 --> 07:27.960
-Mm! Mm! Mm!
-(thudding)

07:27.960 --> 07:30.880
These high-strength airbags
cushion the people inside
the building,

07:30.880 --> 07:33.170
and also prevent floors
from pancaking.

07:35.080 --> 07:39.790
So, just to be clear,
no one here has done
the airbag thing, right?

07:41.580 --> 07:43.830
This approach will be
highly effective.

07:43.830 --> 07:48.920
-Think so?
-Yes. This is exactly
what your brother Tadashi did.

07:48.920 --> 07:49.750
It was highly effective.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.290
Ahhh...

07:52.880 --> 07:55.040
(groans)
This is hopeless.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.080
Hey, you can do this,
little man.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.620
Maybe you've never
had to work this hard
for something before.

07:59.620 --> 08:01.710
School's never
been this hard before.

08:01.710 --> 08:04.120
This place is tough.
For everybody.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.880
I got lost finding
my first class.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.920
Why aren't the buildings
in alphabetical order?

08:07.920 --> 08:10.000
Am I only one
who sees
the obvious solution?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.670
Wasabi?
Is this supposed to be
a pep talk?

08:13.960 --> 08:17.460
Sorry.
The thing is, you got in.
For being you.

08:17.460 --> 08:19.250
Be you, Hiro.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.500
You know what?
You're right.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.000
I got this.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.500
I got nothing.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.830
-Ahh...
-(model shaking)

08:30.830 --> 08:32.000
Ah!

08:34.000 --> 08:35.750
(thud)

08:35.750 --> 08:36.920
Ohh!

08:36.920 --> 08:38.580
Aah! Aah! Whaa!

08:38.580 --> 08:40.420
(crashing)

08:40.420 --> 08:42.960
-(building buzzing)
-(Hiro grunts)

08:42.960 --> 08:45.420
-Ah-huh.
-Got it!

08:45.420 --> 08:47.250
(phones clicking)

08:48.750 --> 08:50.500
Uh, I'm just no good at this.

08:50.500 --> 08:54.330
Mr. Hamada, I'm the one
who gets to tell people
they're no good.

08:54.330 --> 08:56.460
Don't take my favorite part
of the job away.

08:56.460 --> 08:57.920
Well, go ahead. Enjoy.

08:57.920 --> 09:01.040
No.
I'm not letting you off
that easy.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.790
You are going to rise
to this challenge.

09:03.790 --> 09:05.290
What if I'm really
no good at this?

09:05.290 --> 09:09.210
Then you fail.
After which,
you try again.

09:09.210 --> 09:11.790
Professor G?
My new prototype
is ready to go.

09:11.790 --> 09:15.080
But if you want Hiro to say
he's no good a few more times,
totally your call.

09:16.830 --> 09:19.000
Oh, this is so exciting, Baymax.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.290
"City Rising" is back
where it's supposed to be.

09:21.290 --> 09:23.960
Don't worry.
Nobody's gettin' it
on my watch.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.380
Not this time.

09:26.830 --> 09:29.880
Honey Lemon,
thank you for teaching me
about art.

09:29.880 --> 09:33.540
This is gonna be great.
Okay, look at this portrait
from the Golden Age.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.580
What do you see?

09:34.580 --> 09:36.960
I see a man who suffers
from rosacea,

09:36.960 --> 09:40.540
a lack of exercise,
and excessive consumption
of red meat.

09:40.540 --> 09:42.540
That's not what I--
Let me put it another way.

09:42.540 --> 09:46.040
To understand art,
you have to feel it.

09:46.040 --> 09:46.920
Oh.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.120
Oh, no no no--
No. Let's not touch that.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.000
Maybe we should
try something
more abstract.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.330
And less pointy.

10:01.670 --> 10:05.210
-This man was in...
terrible accident.
-No, Baymax.

10:05.210 --> 10:06.960
He's painted that way
to make you feel emotions.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.330
I am not programmed
to feel emotions.

10:09.330 --> 10:12.670
Only to monitor emotions
in others.

10:12.670 --> 10:14.080
You are frustrated.

10:14.080 --> 10:18.420
-I'm fine!
-I detect vocal tones
that indicate frustration.

10:20.790 --> 10:23.500
"Caution: Water Hazard."

10:23.500 --> 10:26.710
Such a bold statement
about the futility
of existence.

10:26.710 --> 10:30.420
I would give anything
to meet the genius who created
this masterpiece.

10:30.420 --> 10:34.080
Allow me to introduce myself,
Fred Frederickson the Fourth,

10:34.080 --> 10:35.670
master of this piece.

10:35.670 --> 10:39.330
(gasp)
A pleasure, sir.
You have moved me.

10:40.330 --> 10:41.620
Cool.

10:41.620 --> 10:43.460
Baymax:
Is this also art?

10:43.460 --> 10:46.710
-Well, duh.
-Well, duh indeed!

10:46.710 --> 10:47.960
(sigh)

10:47.960 --> 10:49.250
Maybe that's
enough for today.

10:49.250 --> 10:51.120
Let's just go.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.620
(grunts)

10:55.330 --> 10:56.670
(snapping)

10:56.670 --> 10:57.880
Ow.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.330
-Did you hear that?
-Baymax:
Art must be seen, felt,

11:00.330 --> 11:01.710
and heard?

11:01.710 --> 11:03.920
Art is-- complicated.

11:05.250 --> 11:06.960
Whoa-- Owww!

11:06.960 --> 11:08.250
Mm-mm! Don't touch!

11:08.250 --> 11:10.920
That's all I'm paid to say.
Don't touch. Did my job.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.880
Everybody saw it,
now outta my way.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.620
Daaa-- Uhm!

11:17.620 --> 11:20.710
Did you just crumple up
and throw away a blank piece
of paper?

11:20.710 --> 11:22.460
I was just tryin'
to save some time.

11:22.460 --> 11:25.790
Okay.
This is gonna hurt you
more than it's gonna hurt me.

11:25.790 --> 11:27.000
What are you doing?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.580
-Slapping him out of it.
-You can't do that!

11:29.580 --> 11:30.710
You got a better idea?

11:30.710 --> 11:32.210
Hmm...

11:32.210 --> 11:37.210
(singing opera-style)
Oh Hiro, stop your
fretting, Hirooo!

11:37.210 --> 11:39.500
-Aah!
-What was that?

11:39.500 --> 11:41.250
Consider it a musical
slap in the face.

11:41.250 --> 11:42.750
Oh, I do.

11:42.750 --> 11:45.080
-(phone rings)
-Globby's back.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.710
-Let's go!
-(grunts)

11:46.710 --> 11:49.380
Uh, yeah.
But my car's still
at the bottom of the bay.

11:51.290 --> 11:53.040
So how are we gonna
get there?

11:53.040 --> 11:55.830
Wasabi:
Rick from the self-driving
car project said we could use it

11:55.830 --> 11:57.000
for an hour.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.080
Can't this thing
self-drive any faster?

11:59.080 --> 12:04.210
Of course it can.
It's just programmed not to
for safety reasons.

12:04.210 --> 12:07.210
-(humming louder)
-Wasabi:
It wasn't me, Rick!

12:07.210 --> 12:10.040
(yelling)

12:10.040 --> 12:12.790
(car screeching)

12:15.080 --> 12:17.960
-(panting)
-Tell me you brought
our super suits!

12:19.540 --> 12:22.420
(grunting)

12:22.420 --> 12:24.040
It's a little tight.

12:24.040 --> 12:27.830
-Where's Globby?
-He's got the Shimamoto,
but the museum's on lockdown.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.620
So he's trapped inside?

12:29.620 --> 12:31.120
Sub-par villains
gonna sub-par.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.830
Wasabi: Ah!
Got a helmet!

12:32.830 --> 12:34.080
Oh!

12:34.080 --> 12:39.500
(grunting)

12:39.500 --> 12:40.670
Aah!

12:40.670 --> 12:43.080
Oh-huh-ho, come on!

12:43.080 --> 12:45.210
(banging)

12:45.210 --> 12:46.210
(splat)

12:48.080 --> 12:50.460
Oww! Ohh.

12:50.460 --> 12:52.790
Hmm. Nice piece.

12:52.790 --> 12:55.170
I hope this works!

12:55.170 --> 12:58.080
-Oohhhh-whooa!
-Fred: Oh, watch your step!

12:58.080 --> 13:01.210
Globby: (grunting)
Oh, it didn't.

13:01.210 --> 13:02.290
Ouch!

13:02.290 --> 13:03.580
Ya think?

13:03.580 --> 13:05.880
Honey Lemon:
He's going for the painting!

13:05.880 --> 13:07.500
Well, he's got
stick-to-it-iveness.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.790
-Aha!
-Uh!

13:09.790 --> 13:12.210
No!
Not this time!

13:13.250 --> 13:15.250
Yes this time!

13:15.250 --> 13:17.170
I got some in my mouth.

13:17.170 --> 13:19.210
Spit him out
and let's drop this blob.

13:19.210 --> 13:20.080
Honey Lemon:
Get him!

13:20.080 --> 13:21.920
Hiro:
Right behind you, Go Go.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.170
Fred:
Get on!

13:23.170 --> 13:26.080
Okay.
But just don't jump--
Tooo hiiiiigh!

13:29.830 --> 13:31.920
Uhh!

13:31.920 --> 13:33.620
Hee-hee!

13:33.620 --> 13:35.080
Oh, it's really happening!

13:35.080 --> 13:37.540
My first successful art heist!

13:37.540 --> 13:39.580
Who's number one now?

13:39.580 --> 13:41.330
-I--
-(splat)

13:41.330 --> 13:43.380
Baymax:
That painting does not
belong to you.

13:43.380 --> 13:44.460
-Thank you.
-Ohh!

13:44.460 --> 13:45.710
(splat)

13:45.710 --> 13:47.250
Well, this isn't fair.

13:47.250 --> 13:49.750
Oh, why do I even bother?

13:50.880 --> 13:52.250
Honey, let's freeze him
and seize him.

13:52.250 --> 13:54.880
-(car screeches)
-Aah!

13:58.210 --> 14:00.790
Did he just... melt?

14:05.670 --> 14:09.380
I can turn into water?
Whoa! What else can I do?

14:09.380 --> 14:11.170
Um, metal!

14:12.710 --> 14:14.040
-(laughs)
-(clang)

14:16.040 --> 14:17.500
Ow!

14:17.500 --> 14:19.580
Yes! What else?

14:19.580 --> 14:21.330
Ice! (laughs)

14:21.330 --> 14:22.580
Rock!

14:22.580 --> 14:25.000
Chocolate! Mm! Mmm!

14:25.000 --> 14:28.620
Wood! Mm-- Mm-- Aaah!

14:28.620 --> 14:29.880
Brick!

14:29.880 --> 14:31.120
Ow!

14:31.120 --> 14:34.040
Chocolate!
Mm! Mm! Double mm!

14:34.040 --> 14:35.540
Cookie dough!

14:35.540 --> 14:38.080
Cotton candy!
Chocolate! With ice cream!
And caramel!

14:38.080 --> 14:39.830
-And whipped cream!
-(spraying)

14:41.880 --> 14:44.580
Ohh!
Whipped cream
in my eye.

14:44.580 --> 14:47.210
Mm-mm, oh...

14:47.210 --> 14:49.620
This could be very useful.

14:49.620 --> 14:51.420
Oh-- Mm, I'm delicious.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.330
Haha.

14:53.330 --> 14:57.000
(grunts)
And powerful.

14:59.380 --> 15:04.210
(Hiro whistling)

15:04.210 --> 15:06.750
All right.
Someone's in a good mood.

15:06.750 --> 15:09.170
Well, yeah.
We crushed our last mission.

15:09.170 --> 15:11.250
We had Globby so scared
he wet himself.

15:11.250 --> 15:14.790
Not exactly.
The volatile chemicals
that made Globby Globby

15:14.790 --> 15:16.210
combined with
the neuro-trasmitter.

15:16.210 --> 15:19.000
-Right.
-Well, Globby finally learned
how his thoughts

15:19.000 --> 15:22.380
can control his,
umm, globbiness?

15:22.380 --> 15:24.250
So he can turn into anything?

15:24.250 --> 15:26.250
That villain is on his way
to being super.

15:26.250 --> 15:29.120
I don't care if he's a solid,
liquid, or gas.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.040
-We can take him.
-Oh, I hope not gas.

15:32.040 --> 15:35.290
-Where's Fred?
-He's at the museum.
In case Globby strikes again.

15:37.580 --> 15:39.250
Bup, bup-bup-bup, bup.

15:39.250 --> 15:43.170
Fine art.
It moves people,
so keep moving.

15:43.170 --> 15:46.290
Anyway, it's great to feel
like I'm good at something.

15:46.290 --> 15:48.330
I really needed that.

15:48.330 --> 15:51.460
So you're finally ready
to step up and crush
that quake-proofing demo.

15:51.460 --> 15:54.620
Totally ready.
I just don't have a plan
of any sort, so, uh--

15:54.620 --> 15:56.960
Well, of course,
you're not just gonna
blow it off.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.460
-I hadn't considered
that, but--
-No, no, no!

15:59.460 --> 16:02.120
Forget I said anything.
Stop looking like you're
considering it.

16:04.420 --> 16:06.120
Hiro, wait!
You can't just quit!

16:06.120 --> 16:08.790
Yeah.
Do you really wanna be known
as a genius quitter?

16:08.790 --> 16:11.460
No.
But at least a genius quitter

16:11.460 --> 16:13.920
is probably the best kind
of quitter, right?

16:13.920 --> 16:17.580
I get it.
You think if you give up,
it doesn't count as failing.

16:17.580 --> 16:19.420
But actually... it's worse.

16:19.420 --> 16:23.750
Tadashi failed 83 times
before I functioned properly.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.210
Well, maybe I'm not
as smart as Tadashi.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.920
Perhaps art therapy
would be beneficial.

16:34.380 --> 16:36.920
Uhh!
Should I be worried here?

16:36.920 --> 16:39.170
He's painting what he knows?

16:46.750 --> 16:48.790
It is all right
to become discouraged.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.380
-I don't wanna talk--
-Tadashi Hamada.
Test number 58,

16:51.380 --> 16:53.170
robotics project.

16:53.170 --> 16:58.210
-Hello.
I am Baymax, your personal--
-No!

16:58.210 --> 17:00.500
(fire extinguisher)

17:00.500 --> 17:04.080
Why?
Why have I put myself
through this 58 times?

17:04.080 --> 17:08.250
(sighs)
Maybe this will never work.
Maybe I should give up.

17:08.250 --> 17:10.250
You're not
still recording, are you?

17:11.250 --> 17:13.330
I never saw him like that.

17:13.330 --> 17:14.830
Fred just called.
The museum decided

17:14.830 --> 17:16.330
to put the painting
into storage.

17:16.330 --> 17:19.540
-Wise move.
-That means it's in a truck
crossing the city.

17:19.540 --> 17:20.710
Not so wise move.

17:20.710 --> 17:22.540
Ah! Ah-ha!

17:22.540 --> 17:26.580
-(truck screeching)
-Ah-ahh!

17:26.580 --> 17:28.500
Ahh! Ahh!

17:28.500 --> 17:30.250
(truck skidding)

17:30.250 --> 17:32.380
(horn honking)

17:32.380 --> 17:33.540
(horn stops)

17:33.540 --> 17:35.170
(yelling)

17:35.170 --> 17:36.540
Ahhhhh!

17:36.540 --> 17:37.460
Acid!

17:40.710 --> 17:42.330
Ha! Got it!

17:42.330 --> 17:45.540
Hiro:
Don't you ever get tired
of losing?

17:45.540 --> 17:48.670
No. (laughs)
No, I really think
today's my day.

17:48.670 --> 17:51.540
Aw, I love your
positive attitude.

17:51.540 --> 17:52.620
Sorry about this.

17:52.620 --> 17:54.500
Aah!

17:58.080 --> 18:01.920
-Careful!
Pavement's a little rough!
-Ah!

18:01.920 --> 18:03.750
Time for a meltdown!

18:04.750 --> 18:06.420
Eh, shut your firehole.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.920
-Mmm! Mmm!
-I got you, buddy!

18:13.620 --> 18:15.290
Come on, Baymax!
It's up to us.

18:15.290 --> 18:17.960
Baymax:
We will protect the art
that is valuable

18:17.960 --> 18:19.290
for some reason.

18:21.210 --> 18:22.210
Oww!

18:23.330 --> 18:24.380
(explosion)

18:25.790 --> 18:26.880
Baymax:
Oh, no.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.330
(crash)

18:30.670 --> 18:32.460
(laughs)

18:32.460 --> 18:35.210
If at first
you don't succeed,
learn to turn yourself

18:35.210 --> 18:36.620
into chocolate.

18:36.620 --> 18:38.710
Enjoy!
Catch you later!

18:38.710 --> 18:40.080
Gotta bounce!

18:40.080 --> 18:41.460
Whoa! Ha-ha!

18:42.750 --> 18:44.460
Ha-ha!
Gettin' away! Yo!

18:44.460 --> 18:46.540
Oh, no.
That was awful!

18:46.540 --> 18:50.540
I know,
"Gotta bounce"?
I mean, it fits, but come on!

18:50.540 --> 18:55.000
-Dig deeper!
-We failed. And worse,
we failed Lenore Shimamoto!

18:55.000 --> 18:57.670
I don't know, Honey Lemon,
that kinda makes us
sound like losers.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.920
Well, we did lose.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.580
Oh, come on, guys,
it's not the end
of the world.

19:02.580 --> 19:07.420
Look at Globby.
He failed again and again,
but he figured it out.

19:07.420 --> 19:08.460
-(Go Go grunts)
-Hiro: Eventually.

19:08.460 --> 19:09.920
It's okay to get discouraged.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.620
But you have
to pick yourself up
and try again.

19:12.620 --> 19:15.620
That's a great speech, Hiro.
But can you get me down?

19:15.620 --> 19:17.170
I'm about to pass out.

19:17.170 --> 19:19.500
(buzzing)

19:19.500 --> 19:21.710
Hey, how's it going,
genius-who's-not-a-quitter?

19:21.710 --> 19:25.210
Honestly, not great.
But failure worked for Globby.

19:25.210 --> 19:26.670
So, why not for me?

19:26.670 --> 19:27.750
That's the spirit.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.960
Hey, Honey Lemon.
My art thingy,
"Caution: Water Hazard,"

19:30.960 --> 19:32.540
just sold
for a million dollars.

19:32.540 --> 19:35.710
Really?
I guess art must be
in the eye of the beholder.

19:35.710 --> 19:38.960
Fred's art evoked
many emotions today.

19:38.960 --> 19:44.420
It might be more accurate
to say, art is in the art
of the beholder.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.920
Aw, you've really learned
a lot about art, Baymax.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.250
-That was very poetic.
-What is poetry?

19:50.250 --> 19:54.080
Mm, maybe another time.
What are you gonna do
with the money, Fred?

19:54.080 --> 19:55.620
Ah, I'm givin' the check
to the museum.

19:55.620 --> 19:58.080
I don't need it,
and they could use
a new fountain.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.580
Plus, they just lost
a priceless painting.

20:01.880 --> 20:05.880
(vibrating)

20:07.580 --> 20:10.620
-What?
-My building has sensors
to measure the seismic forces.

20:10.620 --> 20:14.290
Then it sends out
the exact sonic pulses
needed to counteract them.

20:18.460 --> 20:20.750
-So your solution is cheating?
-No.

20:20.750 --> 20:23.210
My design withstood the shaking
by dealing with the problem

20:23.210 --> 20:26.580
at its source.
-Not only would this structure
save itself,

20:26.580 --> 20:29.540
but it would also save
the other buildings
around it.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.710
This is an excellent solution.

20:31.710 --> 20:33.750
-Uch!
-(photo clicks)

20:33.750 --> 20:35.080
And scene.

20:42.790 --> 20:44.040
Oh!

20:45.960 --> 20:48.000
Mm-- Uh.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.710
Uh! Hmm.

20:49.710 --> 20:51.710
(grunting)

20:51.710 --> 20:52.830
Oooh.

20:52.830 --> 20:55.540
Well?
Did you bring it?

20:55.540 --> 20:59.330
Ahh!
Oh. Oh, uh, uh, yeah.
Here it is.

20:59.330 --> 21:03.460
-You've succeeded.
-Sorry about, you know...
the globs.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.540
Huh. Fascinating.

21:07.710 --> 21:09.620
Ow! Rude!

21:09.620 --> 21:11.580
Hmm...

21:11.580 --> 21:14.670
further study might unlock
even more potential.

21:14.670 --> 21:18.080
Potential, huh?
I told Mom she was wrong
about me.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.750
Lenore Shimamoto the artist
is of no interest to me.

21:20.750 --> 21:22.460
Ehh!

21:22.460 --> 21:26.620
However,
Lenore Shimamoto the scientist,
is of great interest.

21:26.620 --> 21:31.330
Like with so many things
in life, you have to look
below the surface

21:31.330 --> 21:33.620
to find real value.

21:36.710 --> 21:41.710
