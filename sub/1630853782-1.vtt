00:06.340 --> 00:08.634
-[cheering and applause]
-[lively music playing]

00:17.434 --> 00:20.437
[emcee] Give it up
for my good friend and yours,

00:20.562 --> 00:24.233
Whitney Cummings!

00:30.113 --> 00:31.865
[cheering continues]

00:42.626 --> 00:47.130
What is up, Newark, New Jersey?

00:47.214 --> 00:49.550
[cheering]

00:49.633 --> 00:52.219
Whoo! Thank you so much for coming out.

00:52.302 --> 00:55.973
This is my fifth stand-up special
I am taping with you tonight.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.516
It's been a minute.

00:57.599 --> 01:00.185
Uh, my last special, just to catch you up,

01:00.269 --> 01:03.272
I had announced
that I had just gotten engaged.

01:03.355 --> 01:05.399
-[cheering]
-Um…

01:05.482 --> 01:08.110
nope, nope, nope.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.530
My personality handled that.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.659
The problem is, nobody's happy for me
when I say I'm not engaged anymore.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.786
I was just used to,
when you're in your twenties

01:17.870 --> 01:19.913
and you break up with someone,
everyone is so proud of you.

01:19.997 --> 01:23.208
They're like, "Good for you,
you don't need him, fuck him!"

01:23.876 --> 01:25.711
You break up with someone
in your late thirties

01:25.794 --> 01:27.671
and people are like…

01:29.006 --> 01:31.258
"Are you sure?"

01:31.800 --> 01:33.385
You break up with someone
in your twenties,

01:33.468 --> 01:35.262
everybody's worried
about your emotional state.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.930
They're like, "How are you feeling?"

01:37.014 --> 01:38.765
You break up with someone
in your late thirties,

01:38.849 --> 01:41.685
people are just worried
about your physical safety.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.479
They're like, "You live alone again?"

01:44.563 --> 01:46.523
"What if you fall?"

01:49.902 --> 01:51.195
I guess I'm a late bloomer.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.780
It took this long for me to figure out
what I wanted in a relationship,

01:53.864 --> 01:56.283
although I finally figured out
what I wanted-- a man--

01:56.366 --> 01:59.995
only to realize that what I want
is now considered creepy.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.288
Um…

02:01.371 --> 02:03.707
I know it's not popular to say,
but I'm into older men.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.168
That's my thing, I like an older man.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.169
[applause]

02:07.252 --> 02:09.880
Are there any here tonight

02:09.963 --> 02:11.590
or did COVID get 'em?

02:11.673 --> 02:12.758
[laughter]

02:12.841 --> 02:15.469
Do we have any at all? Did any make it?

02:15.552 --> 02:17.304
How old are you, sir?

02:17.387 --> 02:20.682
-Sixty.
-Sixty! Aaaaaah…

02:20.766 --> 02:22.851
I can't-- I can't help it.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.270
Why is that so hot to me?

02:25.354 --> 02:26.563
It's not even like a choice.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.732
It's like every cell in my body

02:28.815 --> 02:31.109
is just like, "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
Daddy, Daddy…"

02:31.193 --> 02:32.569
And then just…

02:33.487 --> 02:34.404
[splutters]

02:34.488 --> 02:36.240
But we can't, we can't do this, sir.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.324
[inhales sharply]

02:37.407 --> 02:39.451
Dating an older man
is now considered creepy.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.578
I think it was 'cause of all
that sexual harassment news.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.372
Now it's, like, creepy to date older guys.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.332
You're not creepy, sir, it's not you.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.833
It's not you specifically.

02:46.917 --> 02:50.420
It's just everything your generation made

02:51.213 --> 02:53.257
is a little sketchy.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.426
I dated an older guy last year
and we went on a road trip.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.555
Every song on his playlist was,
like, wild.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.348
It was like…
♪ Hey, little girl ♪

03:01.431 --> 03:04.017
♪ Is your daddy home? ♪

03:04.101 --> 03:07.062
♪ Did he go away
And leave you all alone? ♪

03:07.145 --> 03:08.730
I was like, "Oh, God."

03:10.482 --> 03:12.067
I used to love that song.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.611
That shit does not hit the same way.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.030
But the good thing
about dating older guys is that

03:17.114 --> 03:20.492
every now and then, you get to listen
to R. Kelly by accident.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.955
'Cause they didn't hear about it.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.918
M'kay? Yahoo! News or whatever

03:31.378 --> 03:32.713
didn't cover that story.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.299
Oh, wow, you're gonna try
to be woke with me?

03:35.382 --> 03:37.801
Newark? You sure?

03:38.552 --> 03:43.515
You're gonna try to tell me when
the R. Kelly "Ignition Remix" comes on--

03:43.599 --> 03:47.477
and it's not your fault--
that that isn't a gift from God?

03:48.770 --> 03:51.273
Okay, I'm not an asshole.
I'm not just going to enjoy the song.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.108
I'm obviously going to educate him,
you know.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.611
I'm gonna be like, "Baby,
you need to turn this song off."

03:55.694 --> 03:57.404
"You need to turn…"

03:57.487 --> 03:59.865
"You need to turn
this song off immediately."

03:59.948 --> 04:02.326
"This man is disgusting."

04:02.409 --> 04:03.493
"This man…"

04:03.577 --> 04:06.496
"This man was a sexual predator."

04:06.580 --> 04:08.373
"What he did was wrong."

04:08.957 --> 04:10.918
"He objectified women."

04:11.752 --> 04:15.214
"There's a documentary
I need you to watch immediately."

04:15.297 --> 04:18.425
"There's a Gayle King interview
I need you to turn on,

04:18.509 --> 04:23.013
and you need to turn this song off
in three minutes."

04:29.603 --> 04:31.855
Not dating an older man
didn't work out for me.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.483
I did, however, get conned
into dating a younger guy.

04:34.566 --> 04:37.444
I'm dating a man
who's nine years younger than I am.

04:37.528 --> 04:38.820
[splutters]

04:39.821 --> 04:41.573
People are so down on younger guys,

04:41.657 --> 04:43.325
like, "How do you communicate with him?"

04:43.408 --> 04:45.911
Like, he speaks, he can speak.
He's not that young.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.246
Um…

04:48.121 --> 04:51.166
The only time we have
communication problems is when we text

04:51.250 --> 04:55.128
because he insists on texting
with the little videos,

04:55.212 --> 04:58.298
the little moving videos
that repeat 50 times.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.843
What are they called, giffies?

05:00.926 --> 05:03.095
GIFs! Everyone calls them
something different.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.222
All I know is that
if I don't respond for 20 minutes,

05:05.347 --> 05:08.392
I get Homer Simpson backing into a bush.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.937
Fifty fuckin' times in a row.

05:12.563 --> 05:15.566
I'm like, "I haven't seen this episode,
I don't know what this means."

05:16.233 --> 05:18.110
I know what most of the giffies mean,

05:18.193 --> 05:20.445
but sometimes it's just,
like, a random person.

05:20.529 --> 05:23.490
Like, usually, it's like Amy Poehler
from Parks and Recreation,

05:23.574 --> 05:25.200
or it's Steve Carell from The Office,

05:25.284 --> 05:28.078
but oftentimes it's just
a random fucking stranger

05:28.161 --> 05:29.621
out of context.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.165
When we first started dating,
he sent me one.

05:32.249 --> 05:36.795
It was like a random toddler
in the back seat of a car

05:36.879 --> 05:38.922
with buck-ass teeth.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.718
She was just staring at me,
she was like…

05:45.137 --> 05:46.430
I didn't know what I was looking at.

05:46.513 --> 05:49.975
I was with a girlfriend, like, "Dude,
if this is his kid, I'm fuckin' out."

05:52.436 --> 05:55.230
"Absolutely not, you need to fix that.
I can't-- no, no."

05:55.314 --> 05:59.776
"'Course not. I can't let that bitch ruin
my Christmas cards, so make that go away."

06:02.154 --> 06:04.573
People are very down
on younger guys, I feel like now.

06:04.656 --> 06:08.118
People always say, when I tell them
I'm dating a younger guy, they're like,

06:08.202 --> 06:09.286
"Well, he's a younger man."

06:09.411 --> 06:13.248
"Isn't he desensitized to women
from watching all that toxic porn?"

06:13.332 --> 06:14.541
Like, I don't think so.

06:14.625 --> 06:17.794
Younger guys are way more sensitive
because of whatever porn they're watching.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.213
He's always so worried about me.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.883
Like he gets really stressed out
when I go visit my stepbrother alone.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.803
Like, waits by the door.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.764
I'm like, "What are you…?"

06:31.058 --> 06:32.100
He's very sweet.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.852
The younger guys are nice.
They're nicer.

06:33.936 --> 06:36.980
I think that maybe it's 'cause
from all that sexual harassment news,

06:37.064 --> 06:40.067
I think the younger guys
might be scared of us or something,

06:40.150 --> 06:43.612
or maybe, you know, they respect us
all of the sudden, whatever it is.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.489
It's annoying as fuck.

06:46.532 --> 06:49.201
This guy, when we first hooked up,
he had to ask permission

06:49.284 --> 06:51.537
for everything he did, everything,
he had to ask consent.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.747
He'd be like, "Can I kiss you?"

06:53.830 --> 06:54.998
"Can I take off your bra?"

06:55.082 --> 06:58.085
I'd be like, "I don't know, bitch,
can you?"

07:00.963 --> 07:02.548
"I'm a 39-year-old woman."

07:02.631 --> 07:04.591
"You want me to have an orgasm,
you better bring me

07:04.675 --> 07:07.010
to the brink of death and back."

07:07.094 --> 07:08.846
"Can you do that?"

07:11.431 --> 07:13.851
[cheering]

07:17.145 --> 07:19.314
They won't even choke us anymore.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.150
They're too afraid to choke us.

07:22.234 --> 07:26.071
He'll do a hover, it's like a choke hover.
He'll just hover his hands.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.657
I'm like, "What the fuck
am I supposed to do with that?"

07:29.324 --> 07:31.118
So now I have to…

07:31.827 --> 07:33.745
So now…

07:35.038 --> 07:37.207
So now I have to choke myself.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.252
I have to choke myself on your hand,

07:40.335 --> 07:44.173
so now I have to do
a sit-up on my day off?

07:44.256 --> 07:47.426
Is this what you bitches
marched for, shitty sex?

07:47.551 --> 07:48.886
Is this what you wanted?

07:48.969 --> 07:51.388
'Cause I would like to start a new march.

07:51.513 --> 07:52.723
"Pay us equally,

07:52.806 --> 07:55.392
but choke us like
the dirty whores we are."

07:55.517 --> 07:57.311
[cheering and applause]

07:57.394 --> 07:58.812
[Whitney chuckling]

08:02.024 --> 08:04.568
Ahh! He's very weird about that stuff

08:04.651 --> 08:06.820
because three months in,
he's still asking permission.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.698
I'm like, "What are you doing?
This is weird. Yes, of course, fine."

08:09.781 --> 08:11.700
He's like, "You just
never know these days."

08:13.035 --> 08:15.329
"All my guy friends, they all say now

08:15.412 --> 08:17.289
that sometimes
you can have sex with a girl,

08:17.372 --> 08:20.125
you'll think it's one thing,
and then later,

08:20.209 --> 08:23.045
you'll find out
that it was something else."

08:24.713 --> 08:25.797
What?

08:26.882 --> 08:29.593
I have a question-- I know this
is gonna get me in so much trouble,

08:29.676 --> 08:33.931
but do you guys not know
when you're raping us?

08:40.771 --> 08:43.899
You seem confused.

08:44.608 --> 08:47.361
Two guys have sex with a girl,
your guy friends next day are like,

08:47.444 --> 08:48.946
"How did it go, man?" You're like…

08:49.029 --> 08:50.155
[inhales sharply]

08:50.239 --> 08:52.199
"Ahh!"

08:52.282 --> 08:54.243
"Dude, it could have gone either way."

08:54.326 --> 08:55.619
"Um…"

08:55.702 --> 08:59.706
"We either had amazing sex
or I'm going to jail, dude."

09:00.374 --> 09:02.000
"Couldn't tell ya."

09:02.084 --> 09:03.210
[laughs]

09:03.293 --> 09:04.962
And then he goes,
"If I don't explicitly ask,

09:05.087 --> 09:06.797
how am I supposed to know
if you're into it?"

09:06.880 --> 09:08.340
I was like, "I see what's happening."

09:08.423 --> 09:11.635
"I need to make an announcement
to clear up some confusion."

09:11.718 --> 09:13.136
"This will solve that problem."

09:13.220 --> 09:16.890
"I know it's a bummer,
but during sex, every now and then,

09:16.974 --> 09:20.519
you guys are gonna
have to look at us in the face."

09:20.644 --> 09:22.187
"And I know it's a bummer."

09:25.482 --> 09:28.110
"You're just gonna
have to check in, just quick…

09:28.193 --> 09:30.863
quick gander, just see what it…"

09:30.946 --> 09:32.155
"Look me in the eyes."

09:32.239 --> 09:34.658
"If I'm crying, it's consensual."

09:34.741 --> 09:36.159
"What's the confusion?"

09:36.243 --> 09:37.953
"I feel like…"

09:38.036 --> 09:40.372
[laughter and applause]

09:40.455 --> 09:43.083
"…you're overcomplicating this."

09:45.419 --> 09:47.754
No, I do like an aggressive man,

09:47.838 --> 09:50.841
but I think that things
have gotten a little too aggressive

09:50.924 --> 09:52.384
in some fetish communities.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.888
I dated a guy that was
in the dom-sub community.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.514
It's a very real thing.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.391
And he said to me,
like on our third date,

09:59.474 --> 10:01.310
"Just so you know,
I would have to be your dom,

10:01.393 --> 10:02.519
you would be my sub."

10:02.644 --> 10:05.939
"I will text you 30 times a day
orders that you have to follow,"

10:06.023 --> 10:08.692
and I was like… [clicks tongue]
"Let me stop you right there."

10:09.234 --> 10:13.447
"You had me at 'texting 30 times a day.'
I'm fucking in, this sounds incredible."

10:15.282 --> 10:16.575
Here's what I did learn, though.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.287
If you're going to text a girl
30 times a day a bunch of orders,

10:20.370 --> 10:22.122
you better know how to spell.

10:22.206 --> 10:25.250
So… you can't dominate me
if you don't know the difference

10:25.334 --> 10:26.543
between "your" and "you're."

10:26.668 --> 10:28.962
You're gonna have to figure that out
at some point.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.966
I found it very silly
until I realized, like,

10:33.050 --> 10:35.844
when he was bossing me around
and telling me things to do,

10:35.928 --> 10:37.346
I was like, "This is so goofy,"

10:37.429 --> 10:40.057
but then I realized
you can use that dom-sub thing

10:40.140 --> 10:44.770
to change all the things
about your dude that annoy you.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.730
He'd be like,
"Get down on your hands and knees!"

10:46.813 --> 10:49.942
And I'll be like, "Mm! Okay."

10:50.025 --> 10:51.276
"Hmm!"

10:51.360 --> 10:53.570
"Hmm… and while I'm down here,

10:53.695 --> 10:56.532
what if I took off those Birkenstocks…

10:56.615 --> 10:58.075
mmm…

10:58.909 --> 11:00.827
and put them in the trash?"

11:00.911 --> 11:03.622
"Ooh, I am so submissive."

11:06.792 --> 11:09.920
"And then what if I took
this Fast and Furious poster

11:10.003 --> 11:11.630
off the wall

11:12.714 --> 11:14.216
and put that in the garbage?"

11:14.299 --> 11:17.094
"And then I'm going to take
this Call of Duty mouse pad,

11:17.177 --> 11:18.428
'cause you're 40."

11:18.512 --> 11:20.222
"Oooh!"

11:22.015 --> 11:25.143
"And what if I took those
iridescent oak leaves off your head,

11:25.227 --> 11:26.562
and what if I sat on them?"

11:26.645 --> 11:29.022
"Ooh, so kinky, so kinky."

11:30.440 --> 11:33.110
"And then I'm gonna
tell your roommate to move out!"

11:33.193 --> 11:35.487
"Ooh, I am so submissive!"

11:38.907 --> 11:40.576
[cheering]

11:45.122 --> 11:47.416
You gotta find the silver lining,
you never know.

11:47.499 --> 11:50.669
I found it very silly, but every time
he would say something that spooked me,

11:50.794 --> 11:54.173
I realized I'm old enough to maybe
benefit from this weird-ass lifestyle.

11:54.256 --> 11:56.675
He'd be like, "If you're bad,
I have to punish you."

11:56.800 --> 11:59.887
I'd be like… [snickering]
"What does that entail?"

11:59.970 --> 12:03.015
He'd be like, "I have to physically
hurt you," and I was like, "Eww."

12:03.098 --> 12:04.600
"That sounds weird."

12:04.683 --> 12:06.852
"Then again I pay people
to do that sometimes."

12:06.935 --> 12:09.062
"Okay, you know
what would really punish me?"

12:09.146 --> 12:13.025
"If you jammed your finger into this knot
right under my shoulder blade

12:13.108 --> 12:14.943
for like 45 minutes every day."

12:15.027 --> 12:16.987
"Ooh, that would punish me so much."

12:17.070 --> 12:19.156
"You know what I hate--
when people crack my back."

12:19.239 --> 12:20.699
"Oh, please don't!"

12:25.037 --> 12:28.165
[sighs] That did not work out.
I couldn't take it seriously.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.710
This new guy, the younger guy, doesn't
make me do anything I don't wanna do.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.795
Almost like--
it's a little much, actually.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.464
I feel like I've gotten really lazy.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.216
Uh, I recently sat him down

12:37.299 --> 12:41.428
and I had to retire
a couple sexual positions.

12:41.512 --> 12:46.183
It's a wrap on Reverse Cowgirl
for me personally.

12:46.308 --> 12:49.478
I'm not trying to be lazy,
I just don't think it's sexy anymore.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.105
I think it's just more distracting
with my knees going

12:52.189 --> 12:55.984
"pop-pop-pop, crack-crack,
pop-pop-pop-pop, pop-pop-pop."

13:01.114 --> 13:03.575
I do believe the joint pop during sex

13:03.659 --> 13:07.663
is truly the only thing
we cannot laugh about yet

13:08.372 --> 13:09.998
as a species.

13:10.082 --> 13:13.919
We can laugh about queefs at this point.
It's not embarrassing, guys love it.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.922
They're like, "Yeah, my dick is so big,
I made that pussy fart, yeah."

13:17.005 --> 13:18.131
[imitating fart]

13:18.215 --> 13:21.218
They love it. They don't think
that you have a giant pussy,

13:21.343 --> 13:23.428
they think they have a giant dick,
you're fine.

13:23.512 --> 13:25.639
You're fine, you're fine.

13:26.557 --> 13:28.433
But that joint pop, that's embarrassing.

13:28.517 --> 13:29.810
There's nothing…

13:29.893 --> 13:33.355
there's nothing you will not say
to get out of that situation, dude.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.899
You go down, like, "pop-pop."
"Was that the bubble wrap?"

13:35.983 --> 13:37.776
"I think that might have been
the bubble wrap."

13:37.860 --> 13:40.988
"Pop-pop? Are we under attack,
was that a machine gun?"

13:41.071 --> 13:43.949
I really try, I give it my all.
I just have too many injuries.

13:44.032 --> 13:47.536
I go down, 20 seconds in, I'm jammed up.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.580
I got that catcher's knee.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.582
He knows right away, he'll be like,

13:51.665 --> 13:53.458
"Baby, do you want to turn over?"

13:56.253 --> 13:59.548
"Turn over? Bitch, I live here now."

14:01.425 --> 14:03.135
"You're dating a 39-year-old woman."

14:03.218 --> 14:05.512
"Reverse Cowgirl
is not the third or fourth position

14:05.596 --> 14:07.097
in a series of nine or ten."

14:07.181 --> 14:10.267
"It's the final position

14:10.392 --> 14:12.936
every time it is attempted, okay?"

14:13.020 --> 14:15.898
"The only thing to do at this point
is to figure out how I can dismount

14:15.981 --> 14:17.441
with a modicum of dignity

14:18.192 --> 14:20.986
without further injuring my L4."

14:21.069 --> 14:24.448
"Now, listen very carefully."

14:25.449 --> 14:28.952
"I'm gonna need you to scoot out."

14:30.704 --> 14:32.247
"Need your little shimmy-shimmy,

14:32.331 --> 14:35.584
little reverse Storming Normandy,
shimmy outta there."

14:36.335 --> 14:39.046
"Now I'm gonna need you
to turn the lights out, pitch-black."

14:40.380 --> 14:42.382
"Go get Mommy some Icy Hot

14:44.009 --> 14:45.802
and some WD-40

14:46.720 --> 14:49.723
while I figure out how to get out
of this goddamn nightmare."

14:49.806 --> 14:52.392
[sighing]

14:52.476 --> 14:53.685
Now I injured my back,

14:54.436 --> 14:56.563
which means now I need
to retire Missionary.

14:56.647 --> 14:58.774
[laughing]

14:58.857 --> 15:01.235
And I also need to retire
this fucking joke.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.529
Whoo!

15:03.612 --> 15:04.988
[applause]

15:11.495 --> 15:13.789
I'm very pro younger guys,
I'm telling you.

15:13.872 --> 15:18.335
They're very sweet, they're very caring,
they want us to have orgasms.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.296
This guy always wants to check
to see if I have an orgasm.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.006
After we had sex, he's like,
"Did you come?"

15:23.090 --> 15:25.175
I'm like, "Of course not."

15:26.426 --> 15:28.345
"When would that have happened?
My hands are up here."

15:28.428 --> 15:29.721
"What do you-- what?"

15:31.974 --> 15:34.893
[applause]

15:34.977 --> 15:36.436
[high-pitched whistling]

15:37.896 --> 15:41.149
Was that a birdcall?
What the fuck's going on over there?

15:41.859 --> 15:45.445
No, he's very into that,
and he's very into, like, sex toys.

15:45.529 --> 15:48.532
For Valentine's Day,
he got me a sex toy as my main gift.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.117
He showed up with this gorgeous box.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.495
Gives it to me, he's like, "I found
this sex toy for you on Instagram."

15:55.330 --> 15:58.876
"It's made for women by women."

16:00.168 --> 16:01.587
I opened it, it's gorgeous.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.213
It's like this glass orb.

16:03.297 --> 16:06.550
I was like, "Baby, this is stunning.
We should put this on the coffee table."

16:06.633 --> 16:11.763
"I would-- I would buy this at West Elm.
How much did you pay for that?"

16:11.847 --> 16:13.432
He was like, "It was $180."

16:13.515 --> 16:16.310
I was like, "Oh, you're going
to return that right now

16:16.393 --> 16:18.604
and I will masturbate with the cash."

16:18.687 --> 16:19.646
"So…"

16:19.730 --> 16:22.858
[laughter and applause]

16:24.526 --> 16:25.485
"Uh…"

16:26.236 --> 16:29.656
"Something you don't know about me
is that my kink is thrift,

16:29.740 --> 16:33.076
and I'm never going to be able to have
an orgasm knowing that was $180."

16:33.160 --> 16:36.371
"Get the fuck outta here.
Okay? You're dating an older woman."

16:36.455 --> 16:39.583
"We're ratchet as fuck
when it comes to sex toys, okay?"

16:39.666 --> 16:42.377
"We came up on the jelly cocks."

16:43.212 --> 16:47.257
$18, 92 veins. That's a bargain.

16:47.341 --> 16:48.592
Now, that is a bargain.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.303
They saved money
because they molded those jelly cocks

16:51.386 --> 16:55.516
onto a homeless man who had just
overdosed on methamphetamine and cocaine.

16:55.599 --> 16:56.767
They're like… [straining]

16:56.850 --> 16:58.560
"We got it!"

16:59.186 --> 17:02.856
"Now all we gotta do is cover it
in glitter and it's ready for market."

17:02.940 --> 17:04.650
[giggles]

17:05.651 --> 17:09.571
Those jelly cocks
had a suction cup on the back.

17:09.655 --> 17:11.782
You just pop that shit onto a wall.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.202
Or a washing machine, in my case.

17:15.994 --> 17:18.580
That is a product made for women.

17:19.456 --> 17:20.916
Is anyone dating an older woman?

17:20.999 --> 17:22.584
Younger man/older woman?

17:23.335 --> 17:25.587
-[man, clapping] Me.
-Yes. One guy. Okay.

17:25.671 --> 17:28.423
How much older?
How much older is she than you?

17:28.507 --> 17:29.967
-Three months.
-Three months.

17:30.092 --> 17:33.303
[laughter and applause]

17:37.766 --> 17:41.103
That's your definition
of "older woman," got it.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.568
How old-- may I ask how old you are, sir?

17:47.651 --> 17:50.487
-[man] 53.
-53, oh, okay. Okay, got it.

17:50.571 --> 17:51.780
You do get points for that.

17:51.864 --> 17:54.324
Do you have a life insurance policy
on her or what's, uh…

17:55.617 --> 17:56.660
[man] Her job does.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.370
Her-- he went, "Her job does."

17:58.453 --> 17:59.580
Uh…

18:01.248 --> 18:03.834
I do feel like a lot of guys
are now dating older women.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.253
It's progressive, but at the same time,
you gotta watch it.

18:06.336 --> 18:09.256
Don't just pat yourself on the back.
You can't waste her time.

18:09.339 --> 18:12.759
You can't trifle with a woman
in her thirties, you know what I'm saying?

18:12.843 --> 18:16.346
If you're dating a woman in her thirties,
that's like going to the grocery store

18:16.430 --> 18:18.348
and buying avocados.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.895
You better have a fuckin' plan.

18:22.978 --> 18:24.438
[laughter]

18:24.521 --> 18:26.815
[applause and cheering]

18:30.777 --> 18:33.614
You don't just go to the grocery store
willy-nilly and decide,

18:33.697 --> 18:35.157
"I'm gonna buy some avocados."

18:35.240 --> 18:38.076
No, you better have
fuckin' guacamole shit in your cart.

18:38.202 --> 18:39.661
You better have a party coming up,

18:39.745 --> 18:41.788
'cause you know
exactly how that's gonna end.

18:41.872 --> 18:43.999
Day one, you look
at those brand-new avocados,

18:44.082 --> 18:45.292
you're like,

18:46.877 --> 18:48.795
"I got all the time in the world."

18:48.879 --> 18:50.881
You have five days!

18:50.964 --> 18:53.008
Like my dude, I tell him,
"I don't give a shit."

18:53.091 --> 18:55.219
"You're gonna marry me.
I will propose to you."

18:55.302 --> 18:56.512
"I don't give a fuck, okay?"

18:56.595 --> 19:00.933
"I'm not gonna just let you watch me rot
while you plan a scavenger hunt

19:02.684 --> 19:05.020
so that I can hunt for my ring,

19:05.103 --> 19:08.982
following a treasure map into the woods
like a fucking truffle pig."

19:09.066 --> 19:10.567
Like… [snorting]

19:10.651 --> 19:13.529
"Can I have my ring, please?" [snorting]

19:16.657 --> 19:18.534
You guys overthink the proposal thing.

19:18.617 --> 19:20.202
I feel like I want to get ahead of it.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.246
I don't want him to get down
on one knee and propose.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.498
I don't want him to see my neck
from this angle.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.959
Like, I feel like
I'll lose a lot of leverage.

19:27.042 --> 19:31.129
Don't you dare shoot my neck
from this fuckin' angle, either.

19:31.713 --> 19:34.842
No, I do not understand why women
don't propose to men more.

19:34.925 --> 19:37.636
Um, I always thought that was weird
until I thought through it.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.638
"Why don't I get down
on one knee and propose?"

19:39.721 --> 19:42.724
And then I realized why
'cause I thought it through, right?

19:42.808 --> 19:44.518
"Okay, I'm going
to get down on one knee…"

19:44.601 --> 19:46.270
Pop-pop, crack-crack.

19:47.396 --> 19:49.773
And I realized that
if you're a woman proposing to a man,

19:49.857 --> 19:52.943
you have to open with something
completely different than the guys open.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.111
I would have to open with,

19:54.194 --> 19:58.657
"If you take your dick out right now,
I will fucking kill you."

19:58.740 --> 20:01.285
[laughter]

20:01.368 --> 20:03.912
[scattered applause]

20:03.996 --> 20:05.831
[applause building]

20:09.376 --> 20:11.169
"I thought that maybe

20:11.295 --> 20:14.631
all of our friends and family behind me

20:14.715 --> 20:17.384
might be a dead giveaway

20:17.467 --> 20:19.887
that I'm not gonna suck your dick…

20:22.139 --> 20:24.016
on this beach…

20:26.018 --> 20:29.521
next to your niece who's filming."

20:30.522 --> 20:31.940
"But I guess I have to say this."

20:32.024 --> 20:34.067
"Also, when have I
sucked your dick on one knee?"

20:34.151 --> 20:37.738
"When have I ever been
in this configuration? Okay?"

20:37.821 --> 20:40.991
"I would never suck your dick on one knee
because I know you would think

20:41.074 --> 20:44.077
about Colin Kaepernick,
and we can't both be doing that."

20:44.161 --> 20:48.290
-[audience] Ooh!
-[scattered applause]

20:51.877 --> 20:54.379
Then I would just go
into my romantic speech.

20:55.547 --> 20:59.051
I'd be like, "Alex, will you make me
the happiest woman in the world

20:59.134 --> 21:01.011
and let me buy my own engagement ring?"

21:01.094 --> 21:03.639
"'Cause you can't afford
the one I deserve."

21:03.722 --> 21:06.225
[laughter and applause]

21:08.393 --> 21:09.478
[inhales sharply]

21:09.561 --> 21:11.104
[sighs]

21:11.188 --> 21:13.774
I've been wrong before.
I can be wrong.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.440
But this is the first guy
I've ever dated

21:15.523 --> 21:17.778
where I do feel like
we might have kids together,

21:17.861 --> 21:20.072
but I also kind of want to make sure,
before we have kids,

21:20.155 --> 21:23.825
we do those, like, 23andMe tests
so I know what I'm in for.

21:23.909 --> 21:26.495
Has anyone done a 23andMe test?

21:26.578 --> 21:28.664
-[fan] Whoo!
-Yeah? How'd it go?

21:28.747 --> 21:29.998
[woman] I'm 10% Native American.

21:30.082 --> 21:32.459
You're 10% Native American,
but you didn't know that?

21:32.543 --> 21:33.502
[woman] No idea.

21:33.585 --> 21:37.005
Your kids will be getting into college,
so congratulations.

21:37.089 --> 21:38.590
You have that.

21:40.884 --> 21:42.761
I'm obsessed with these ancestry results.

21:42.845 --> 21:44.930
But no one will let me take that test.
They'll be like,

21:45.013 --> 21:46.682
"They're gonna take your data."

21:48.267 --> 21:50.018
Who gives a fuck?

21:50.102 --> 21:53.730
They'll be like, "They're gonna have
your phone number and email address."

21:53.814 --> 21:55.858
I'm like, "Okay."

21:55.941 --> 22:00.445
I'm old enough to remember
when there used to be a book

22:02.197 --> 22:04.533
full of everyone's phone numbers

22:04.616 --> 22:06.994
and home addresses

22:07.077 --> 22:09.663
and they would just throw it

22:10.289 --> 22:12.457
at your house.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.501
[applause]

22:18.255 --> 22:21.800
They were all over
people's porches, in bags.

22:21.884 --> 22:22.968
No one even opened them.

22:23.051 --> 22:27.139
Homeless people would wipe
their assholes with your data.

22:27.222 --> 22:30.142
No one wants your fuckin' data,

22:30.225 --> 22:32.853
you dorks!

22:33.812 --> 22:35.230
[laughter]

22:39.109 --> 22:43.113
Everyone in the audience in their twenties
is like, "She doesn't get it."

22:44.865 --> 22:48.911
"Our data is very precious.
Everyone's, like, obsessed with it."

22:48.994 --> 22:49.953
I'm aware.

22:50.037 --> 22:53.081
I have a 25-year-old guy
working in my office.

22:53.165 --> 22:55.834
Everything's about his privacy
and his data-- I can't even pay him.

22:55.918 --> 22:57.252
He will not send me his tax form.

22:57.336 --> 22:59.713
He's like, "I can't email this document."

22:59.796 --> 23:01.673
"This is a private document."

23:01.757 --> 23:03.050
"My private information."

23:03.133 --> 23:05.802
I'm like, "Cool."

23:06.678 --> 23:10.891
We used to fax our "private" documents

23:11.517 --> 23:15.187
to an establishment called Kinko's.

23:17.564 --> 23:20.609
To a communal tray.

23:21.485 --> 23:23.820
Full of other private documents.

23:23.904 --> 23:29.326
Our encryption, it was something
called a "cover page."

23:31.411 --> 23:34.998
Just a piece of paper you would put
on top of the other piece of paper.

23:35.082 --> 23:37.626
If there was a ceiling fan,
you were fucked.

23:40.796 --> 23:42.130
There's no privacy in Kinko's.

23:42.214 --> 23:44.216
You go to the front of the line,
like, "Hey, um,

23:44.299 --> 23:46.051
I'm here to pick up my private document."

23:46.134 --> 23:50.264
They'll be like, "Cool.
Are you the girl with the DUI or, uh…

23:50.347 --> 23:52.933
the one with the Valtrex prescription?"

23:53.016 --> 23:54.142
You'll be like,

23:54.226 --> 23:56.603
"Dude, chill, I'm both. Chill."

23:56.687 --> 23:58.397
[laughter]

23:58.522 --> 24:00.232
[scattered applause]

24:00.315 --> 24:03.694
You putting tape over your camera
on your computer, sir?

24:03.777 --> 24:05.696
You are? I knew it.

24:06.864 --> 24:09.157
Putting tape over your computer camera.

24:09.241 --> 24:11.743
You're like,
"Russia's not gonna see this dick."

24:17.165 --> 24:20.836
"They don't deserve to see
this V-neck and this dick."

24:24.423 --> 24:26.049
You deleting your cookies?

24:27.176 --> 24:31.054
You don't know, you're not sure.
That means, "Yes, every 20 seconds."

24:32.389 --> 24:33.891
All the guys in my office are like,

24:34.016 --> 24:36.435
"We need a program
that deletes all of our cookies."

24:36.518 --> 24:39.271
I'm like, how much weird-ass porn
are you watching?

24:39.354 --> 24:43.025
Where is our homie, where is 65?
Where is our guy? Did he pass on?

24:43.108 --> 24:44.693
Okay, there he is. Um…

24:44.776 --> 24:45.777
[laughter]

24:45.861 --> 24:47.863
Listen to me. They-- if you can hear me.

24:47.946 --> 24:51.575
Listen, they… watch all the porn
on the Internet,

24:51.658 --> 24:54.578
and then they complain
that it doesn't get deleted fast enough.

24:54.661 --> 24:55.913
They have to delete their cookies.

24:56.038 --> 24:59.875
Do you have any idea what he had to do
when he wanted to see a pair of titties?

25:02.044 --> 25:05.214
He had to drive into town.

25:06.798 --> 25:09.384
Look for a newsstand.

25:09.468 --> 25:12.763
He had to look a grown man in the eye

25:13.889 --> 25:19.061
and say, "I would like
a Big Beaver magazine, please."

25:19.144 --> 25:20.562
[applause]

25:26.068 --> 25:29.780
His cookies was a human man!

25:30.948 --> 25:34.576
Who he could run into
at the grocery store or church whenever.

25:34.660 --> 25:35.827
He never knew.

25:35.911 --> 25:40.582
If he wanted to delete his cookies,
he had to kill his friend!

25:40.666 --> 25:42.834
[laughter and applause]

25:45.379 --> 25:47.422
This man is an American hero.

25:47.506 --> 25:49.007
That's what he is.

25:57.516 --> 26:00.894
I feel I might be a little desensitized
to all the privacy stuff.

26:00.978 --> 26:03.939
Maybe, I don't know,
I think that that ship sailed for me.

26:04.022 --> 26:06.733
Uh, if you didn't hear,
a couple of years ago,

26:06.817 --> 26:09.570
I had my nudes publicly leaked.

26:09.653 --> 26:13.448
Uh, and I'm gonna tell you something
right now, Newark, New Jersey.

26:14.449 --> 26:16.326
It wasn't that bad.

26:17.661 --> 26:19.037
-[applause]
-Wasn't that bad.

26:20.956 --> 26:22.249
Uh…

26:22.332 --> 26:25.878
They got my whole cloud,
and I was actually way more embarrassed

26:25.961 --> 26:29.381
about all my screen grabs
of inspirational quotes.

26:32.384 --> 26:35.179
That's the shit you want to get ahead of,
that will bite you in the ass.

26:35.262 --> 26:37.931
I was like, "You guys can have my titties,
but please don't tell anyone

26:38.015 --> 26:41.143
about all those Marilyn Monroe quotes

26:41.226 --> 26:43.979
in that folder titled,
'You got this, girl.'"

26:44.062 --> 26:46.690
"It was a bad… week."

26:48.317 --> 26:49.401
It was so stupid.

26:49.484 --> 26:52.321
It wasn't even a nude photo that
I got to take myself and make it cute.

26:52.404 --> 26:54.281
It was a screen grab of a video

26:54.364 --> 26:57.117
that I'd accidentally uploaded
on Instagram Stories

26:57.201 --> 26:59.995
when I was in the bathtub
and high on edibles.

27:00.078 --> 27:01.580
-[scattered laughter]
-So…

27:02.247 --> 27:05.083
I'm in the bathtub and I'm making
this Instagram Story, right?

27:05.167 --> 27:07.211
I'm so high.
I get out of the bathtub.

27:07.294 --> 27:10.172
And you know when you post something
on social media and you're like,

27:10.255 --> 27:11.882
"I feel like that was good."

27:12.799 --> 27:15.219
Like, "I feel like that's
gonna get in the algorithm."

27:15.302 --> 27:16.595
Like, "That's gonna get in there."

27:16.720 --> 27:19.097
I open my phone
to see how many "likes" it got.

27:19.181 --> 27:21.767
"14 missed calls."

27:22.684 --> 27:25.062
My friends were like,
"Whitney, your tits are on the Internet!"

27:25.187 --> 27:27.356
I had videoed myself getting…

27:31.985 --> 27:33.946
out of the bathtub.

27:34.029 --> 27:37.324
And it was a very long video, because…

27:38.116 --> 27:40.702
You know when you're high or drunk
and you're alone in your house

27:40.786 --> 27:43.747
and you're convinced that
all your furniture's trying to kill you?

27:45.374 --> 27:49.044
I was like, "Not tonight, side table.
Not tonight."

27:50.295 --> 27:53.465
"Coffee table looking at me
like I'm a snack, no way."

27:53.549 --> 27:55.259
[laughs]

27:55.342 --> 27:57.052
So I was able to delete it.

27:57.135 --> 27:59.805
Everything was fine,
it came down in, like, five minutes.

27:59.888 --> 28:03.559
Three months later,
I get this very cryptic email

28:03.642 --> 28:05.727
from an AOL address.

28:07.604 --> 28:08.814
This can't be good.

28:09.314 --> 28:12.401
I open it, and it was a guy
who was trying to extort me.

28:12.484 --> 28:14.403
He goes, "If you don't give me $10,000,

28:14.486 --> 28:18.031
I'm gonna sell this photo
of your boobs to a tabloid."

28:18.115 --> 28:20.033
And I'm, like, opening the photo,
it's loading,

28:20.117 --> 28:24.329
and I'm like, "Wait a second, how did he
know my boobs cost exactly $10,000?"

28:24.413 --> 28:27.374
Like, this is a very fair hacker.

28:27.457 --> 28:28.959
Um…

28:29.042 --> 28:32.004
I open it and it's a screen grab
of the video

28:32.087 --> 28:34.089
where I'm hunched over at this angle,

28:34.173 --> 28:37.342
and it is not a flattering angle.

28:37.426 --> 28:40.262
And on a bit of a serious note,
if you guys saw my last special,

28:40.345 --> 28:43.599
you know that I talked about my history
of struggling with eating disorders

28:43.682 --> 28:45.100
and body image issues,

28:45.184 --> 28:48.520
and I hope every woman
accepts their body unconditionally

28:48.604 --> 28:49.897
wherever you are.

28:49.980 --> 28:51.690
[applause]

28:58.822 --> 29:00.991
Except from this angle.

29:01.074 --> 29:03.911
Um… because
it's actually not acceptable.

29:03.994 --> 29:07.206
I said all that
before I had seen titties from this angle.

29:07.289 --> 29:09.917
Uh, nobody told me,
no matter how perky your tits are,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.295
the second you bend over,
they get long and pointy.

29:13.378 --> 29:14.880
Did you know about this?

29:14.963 --> 29:17.716
They're super perky,
then they just turn into traffic cones.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.301
Did you know that?

29:19.384 --> 29:20.886
With, like, a dent in the side.

29:20.969 --> 29:24.389
Like traffic cones where someone
kicked in the side of the…

29:25.224 --> 29:28.060
I did not know
about that elasticity situation.

29:28.143 --> 29:29.895
I mean, I had a little bit of a suspicion.

29:29.978 --> 29:33.106
I had seen a glimpse of myself having
doggie-style sex in a mirror before,

29:33.190 --> 29:35.275
and I remember thinking,
"Why do my titties look

29:35.359 --> 29:38.111
like those inflatable men
outside a car dealership?"

29:38.195 --> 29:39.279
They're just sort of…

29:45.661 --> 29:48.205
And I know on my last special
I talked about having fake boobs,

29:48.288 --> 29:50.082
but the fake boobs,
they do the same thing.

29:50.165 --> 29:53.293
You thought they'd stay cute, they don't.
They get long and pointy and weird.

29:53.377 --> 29:55.963
I think the fake boobs
unionized with the real boobs.

29:56.046 --> 29:57.548
They started working together.

29:57.631 --> 30:00.425
And the only real difference
between fake boobs and real boobs

30:00.509 --> 30:02.469
is that real boobs, you know,
when you lie down,

30:02.553 --> 30:04.346
they just completely disappear.

30:04.429 --> 30:07.266
They're gone, dude. They ghost you.

30:07.349 --> 30:10.185
They're like,
"Bitch, I did my job. Peace!"

30:12.104 --> 30:15.566
Whereas fake boobs, fake boobs,
they go no place.

30:15.649 --> 30:18.402
The guy that I'm with had never slept
with a girl with fake boobs before.

30:18.485 --> 30:21.071
The first time I lied down naked
in front of him, he literally--

30:21.154 --> 30:22.990
literally this was his reaction--
he'd be like…

30:23.073 --> 30:27.494
[gasps] Like it was a-- audible gasp.
It was like [gasps].

30:27.578 --> 30:28.620
I would say, "What?"

30:28.704 --> 30:30.956
It is jarring,
it's a little jarring, it is.

30:31.039 --> 30:33.250
It's like two crocodile eyes
coming out of a pond.

30:33.375 --> 30:34.793
It's very…

30:34.918 --> 30:37.796
[laughter and applause]

30:37.921 --> 30:39.256
It is relentless.

30:39.381 --> 30:40.465
And, uh…

30:40.549 --> 30:42.551
although I do sometimes miss
having real boobs

30:42.634 --> 30:44.136
because I miss them disappearing.

30:44.219 --> 30:47.264
My favorite prank used to be when I would
hook up with a guy for the first time,

30:47.347 --> 30:49.016
I would lay down
and my boobs would disappear,

30:49.099 --> 30:52.352
and he'd get on top of me,
and I'd go, "Ha ha! You're gay."

30:52.436 --> 30:55.189
[Whitney laughing]

30:57.608 --> 30:59.985
I know. Can you believe I'm not married?

31:00.068 --> 31:01.195
Um…

31:01.278 --> 31:02.279
[scattered applause]

31:02.362 --> 31:03.739
Wild!

31:03.822 --> 31:06.200
So I'm in this situation
where this guy's trying to extort me.

31:06.283 --> 31:09.161
I'm not gonna give him the $10,000.
He's just gonna do this to someone else.

31:09.244 --> 31:11.413
So I was like, "Oh, God,
this is such an ethical dilemma."

31:11.496 --> 31:14.499
So I was like, "Okay, I'm just gonna
post these photos on social media

31:14.583 --> 31:15.918
so he can't sell them."

31:16.001 --> 31:21.840
I queued them up to post to Instagram
and Twitter in, like, an hour.

31:21.965 --> 31:23.550
I scheduled the post, and then

31:23.634 --> 31:27.596
I did like seven shots of whiskey
and passed out.

31:27.679 --> 31:29.932
Woke up three hours later.

31:30.015 --> 31:33.769
Your Auntie Whitney trending on Porn Hub.

31:33.852 --> 31:35.562
[cheering and applause]

31:45.030 --> 31:46.615
I feel like…

31:46.698 --> 31:50.536
I feel like all the guys that were dragged
here by their wives and girlfriends

31:50.619 --> 31:53.330
right now are like,
"That is how I know her."

31:53.455 --> 31:54.790
"Okay, I know… "

31:54.873 --> 31:58.126
"I got it. I know her, I know her.
I know who that is, okay."

32:00.754 --> 32:02.673
I get shamed about this all the time.

32:02.756 --> 32:05.092
People blame me, like,
"Why were your photos in the cloud?"

32:05.175 --> 32:06.510
"Why did you have videos in the cloud?"

32:06.593 --> 32:08.554
"Why didn't you have privacy
for all your photos?"

32:08.637 --> 32:11.265
'Cause I'm not a fucking nerd?

32:12.474 --> 32:14.476
Like, when has that even been an option?

32:14.560 --> 32:17.521
That's not something I'm trained
to think is even possible, dude.

32:17.604 --> 32:20.649
We used to take a roll of film,

32:22.317 --> 32:24.987
and we would leave it

32:26.154 --> 32:29.157
with some guy at Kroger

32:29.241 --> 32:30.993
for like a week.

32:31.743 --> 32:35.289
And then we found out whatever the fuck
he was doing only took an hour.

32:35.372 --> 32:37.457
Like, none of it's good.

32:38.584 --> 32:42.045
Those prints came back sticky as hell.
You know I'm right.

32:43.881 --> 32:46.300
I never want to be negative
about technology.

32:46.383 --> 32:49.469
The only time I ever get
a little bit suspicious of technology

32:49.553 --> 32:52.472
is when I go to the doctor
and I see some new gadget

32:52.556 --> 32:53.849
that we didn't have before

32:53.932 --> 32:56.643
that makes you do math
on what we did before the gadget.

32:56.727 --> 32:59.521
Like I had to go in
for a COVID test last year.

32:59.605 --> 33:01.815
They were like, "Ma'am,
we need to take your temperature."

33:01.899 --> 33:03.525
I was like, "Cool."

33:10.282 --> 33:13.118
They were like,
"Ma'am, we haven't done that

33:13.202 --> 33:15.662
in a while now."

33:15.746 --> 33:19.416
I was like, "I haven't had my temperature
taken in a while now, so what?"

33:19.499 --> 33:22.586
This next generation,
you just had little laser beams?

33:22.669 --> 33:23.837
Aimed at your forehead?

33:23.921 --> 33:27.716
And we had anal sex with thermometers
our entire childhoods?

33:27.799 --> 33:30.761
You guys are just cool with this?
You're just gonna let this slide?

33:30.844 --> 33:33.972
'Cause I would like to discuss
reparations at some point.

33:35.849 --> 33:38.769
If you think about what it was like
for us to be at the doctor as kids,

33:38.852 --> 33:40.229
it'll ruin your day.

33:41.104 --> 33:44.525
When I was a kid,
you got buck naked at every doctor.

33:44.608 --> 33:46.527
No questions asked.

33:47.402 --> 33:49.196
I still do it.

33:49.947 --> 33:52.574
Old habits, dude.
I just want to get out of there quickly,

33:52.658 --> 33:54.701
and there's rules about it,
there's laws now.

33:54.785 --> 33:57.996
If a doctor walks in, they'll be like,
"No, ma'am, you've got to put on a robe."

33:58.121 --> 33:59.164
"This is illegal now."

33:59.248 --> 34:00.958
"What do you mean?
You're my ophthalmologist."

34:01.083 --> 34:02.709
"Don't you need to see if…?"

34:03.544 --> 34:06.839
"Don't you need to see if my nipples work?
Like, since when?"

34:08.715 --> 34:12.761
I feel like what happened
is that women started becoming doctors

34:12.845 --> 34:16.932
and they looked at the protocols that
the male doctors had made before them,

34:17.015 --> 34:19.351
and they were like,
"Okay, let's see what…"

34:21.478 --> 34:24.439
"Wait a second,
they didn't need to be naked

34:24.523 --> 34:28.819
at the ear, nose and throat doctor,
you perverts."

34:28.902 --> 34:31.822
They were like…
[deep voice] "Eh, we had a good run."

34:31.905 --> 34:33.240
[laughter]

34:33.323 --> 34:35.576
"Don't worry, we got Polaroids."

34:37.619 --> 34:39.913
I went to my annual gynecological exam.

34:39.997 --> 34:42.165
For the first time ever,
there was, all of the sudden,

34:42.249 --> 34:43.959
a chaperone in the room.

34:44.042 --> 34:45.586
Is that a law here?

34:45.669 --> 34:47.796
There's a chaperone
during the gynecological--

34:47.880 --> 34:50.674
this never happened before.
I've been going to this guy for 25 years.

34:50.757 --> 34:53.135
He's 70 years old, all of the sudden
there's this nurse there.

34:53.218 --> 34:55.679
I was like, "My only opportunity
to get fingered by an older man,

34:55.762 --> 34:56.930
and you are fucking it up!"

34:57.014 --> 34:59.016
"You are fucking this up for me."

34:59.141 --> 35:01.643
[applause]

35:01.727 --> 35:05.272
"What? What? Oh, he's got
to wear gloves during the exam?"

35:05.355 --> 35:07.691
"Cool! You fucking nerd."

35:09.067 --> 35:11.069
"We have a thing going on."

35:11.737 --> 35:13.739
I was fine, I was like,
"Dude, I'm used to this."

35:13.822 --> 35:16.200
She was the one stressed out.
I was like, "Are you okay?"

35:16.283 --> 35:18.535
"Do you need a chaperone?"

35:18.660 --> 35:20.579
"You're watching me
get fingered by Santa Claus."

35:20.662 --> 35:22.497
"How are you doing?"

35:22.581 --> 35:24.499
[laughter]

35:26.501 --> 35:27.628
[applause]

35:27.711 --> 35:28.712
I'm sorry.

35:28.795 --> 35:30.506
I'm sorry.

35:30.589 --> 35:33.342
I didn't mean to ruin Santa Claus for you.

35:34.259 --> 35:37.596
No, I feel like I'm the most
pro-technology of all my friends.

35:37.679 --> 35:40.182
A lot of my friends
are very against technology.

35:40.265 --> 35:41.350
They're worried about it.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.393
It's mostly my friends that are parents.

35:43.477 --> 35:47.064
As soon as my friends become parents,
they get freaked out about technology.

35:47.189 --> 35:50.108
Mostly the phones, that's every
conversation I have with parents now.

35:50.234 --> 35:53.111
They're like, "These kids, now they're
on their phones eight hours a day."

35:53.237 --> 35:55.447
"Kids are on their phones
all day long now."

35:55.531 --> 35:56.865
I'm like, "Good."

35:58.575 --> 36:01.370
"We've finally figured out a way
to shut them the fuck up."

36:01.453 --> 36:02.788
"Why…"

36:02.871 --> 36:04.957
[applause]

36:05.040 --> 36:08.418
"Why are you complaining
about this miracle in your living room?"

36:08.502 --> 36:12.089
They're like, "Whitney, because the phones
are dangerous for the kids."

36:12.214 --> 36:13.340
Eh…

36:13.423 --> 36:14.550
Are they?

36:15.133 --> 36:18.053
Is anything more dangerous for the kids
than what we played on?

36:18.846 --> 36:22.140
You want to put your kids on the shit
we played on when we were children?

36:22.266 --> 36:24.643
Okay, great, why don't you put your kid
on a merry-go-round?

36:24.726 --> 36:26.478
Remember that quality item?

36:27.312 --> 36:30.399
It's like a lazy Susan for pedophiles.

36:36.697 --> 36:39.324
Make sure they saw
every angle of the kid.

36:39.825 --> 36:41.702
They wait for the first kid
to fall off who didn't cry.

36:41.785 --> 36:43.704
They'd be like, "That's the one."

36:44.538 --> 36:47.708
We used to play
on something called a seesaw.

36:48.917 --> 36:51.670
It's a piece of wood on a hinge.

36:52.504 --> 36:58.802
The main objective was just to catapult
the other child… into the air.

36:58.886 --> 37:00.429
And we were such homicidal psychopaths.

37:00.512 --> 37:02.681
If you were the kid
that was on the bottom, you'd be like,

37:04.391 --> 37:06.476
"I wonder what would happen

37:06.977 --> 37:09.188
if I just jumped off this?"

37:10.564 --> 37:11.815
[laughter and applause]

37:11.899 --> 37:12.983
We'd…

37:13.066 --> 37:17.279
We'd watch the other kid
careen to the ground,

37:18.030 --> 37:19.698
shattered nine vertebrae.

37:19.781 --> 37:21.992
Attempted murder, every day.

37:22.492 --> 37:24.286
At recess.

37:26.997 --> 37:28.457
"But the phones!"

37:28.540 --> 37:29.750
Fuck outta here.

37:30.584 --> 37:33.629
I have a goddaughter, she's five.
I went to her playground.

37:33.712 --> 37:36.507
If you've been to a playground recently,
you know playgrounds are totally--

37:36.590 --> 37:39.218
You know, playgrounds now,
they're, like, mushy?

37:43.430 --> 37:46.808
Did you know that playgrounds have shade?

37:50.103 --> 37:55.067
Dude, we had a slide
made out of sheet metal.

37:55.150 --> 37:57.986
[cheering and applause]

38:01.615 --> 38:04.660
It would bake in the hot sun.

38:05.536 --> 38:09.248
Dude, you'd get down on it.
It was like a hot skillet.

38:09.373 --> 38:12.042
You'd go down that slide, like…
[shrieking]

38:12.125 --> 38:15.045
We'd be squealing like pigs.

38:15.128 --> 38:18.340
Frying our assholes!

38:19.508 --> 38:24.346
Which had just had a thermometer in it
20 minutes earlier

38:24.429 --> 38:25.889
at the school nurse.

38:25.973 --> 38:28.016
[cheering and applause]

38:29.476 --> 38:32.354
It kind of ruined our plans
to put sparklers in our butts

38:32.437 --> 38:33.856
later that night.

38:33.939 --> 38:35.858
[giggles]

38:35.941 --> 38:38.819
This is a very incendiary thing
to talk about, people will argue with me.

38:38.902 --> 38:41.488
They're like, "Whitney,
it's also about, like, the phones."

38:41.572 --> 38:44.700
"They can be tracked.
What if predators find the kids?"

38:44.783 --> 38:46.493
I'm like, "Yeah, that's bad,
that's not good."

38:47.077 --> 38:49.913
Then again,
when I was a kid on the schoolyard,

38:49.997 --> 38:52.207
we would play a game on the swings

38:52.291 --> 38:54.251
called "Spider"

38:54.334 --> 38:57.963
where you would straddle
the other child and just…

39:12.394 --> 39:13.937
fuck each other.

39:14.980 --> 39:17.065
We'd just fuck each other
in broad daylight.

39:17.149 --> 39:19.401
All the teachers saw what we were doing.

39:19.484 --> 39:21.236
The teachers were
in the corner like, "Aaah!"

39:21.320 --> 39:23.280
Like, they knew. They didn't care.

39:24.364 --> 39:26.950
Any predator that found the kid
on their phone,

39:27.034 --> 39:29.369
they'd walk up and they'd be like,
"Eww, never mind, dude."

39:29.453 --> 39:31.747
"Those kids are nasty."

39:32.831 --> 39:36.793
You cannot argue that kids are not
physically safer than they've ever been.

39:36.877 --> 39:39.129
Like, kids don't get injured
the way we got injured.

39:39.213 --> 39:42.299
When's the last time
you saw a kid in a cast?

39:43.717 --> 39:45.636
It doesn't fuckin' happen, dude.

39:45.719 --> 39:50.224
We used to spend the first 45 minutes
of school signing casts.

39:50.307 --> 39:54.603
That's how we learned to read and write.

40:00.067 --> 40:03.237
Half the kids in my grade,
they had a cast with a metal bar.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.531
It was a metal rod, it was a metal--

40:05.614 --> 40:09.034
kids were doing the Hitler salute
just the entire school year.

40:10.369 --> 40:13.747
I do feel like the casts
were like the first "comments section."

40:17.000 --> 40:20.212
We'd all write on them, we'd be like,
"Hey, love you. Get well soon."

40:20.754 --> 40:23.715
And then some punk would draw
like a dick on the back, with balls.

40:23.799 --> 40:25.467
No one would tell the kid.

40:26.260 --> 40:29.096
Just add emotional injury
to physical injury.

40:29.179 --> 40:30.722
[giggles]

40:30.806 --> 40:32.474
People will even argue with me about that.

40:32.558 --> 40:34.935
People will be like,
"No, Whitney, the kids do get injured

40:35.018 --> 40:37.312
'cause they type all day
and it hurts their fingers

40:37.396 --> 40:40.065
and their fingers have pre-arthritis."

40:40.148 --> 40:42.025
I'm like, "Got it."

40:43.151 --> 40:46.238
We used to play a game
called "Bloody Knuckles."

40:46.572 --> 40:47.948
[laughter]

40:48.031 --> 40:50.617
[scattered applause]

40:50.701 --> 40:53.036
We would just punch each other
in the knuckles

40:53.120 --> 40:54.872
until our eyes started twitching.

40:55.622 --> 40:58.292
They're like, "But sometimes
the kids have to wear wrist braces

40:58.375 --> 41:00.961
because they get tendonitis
in their wrists from typing."

41:01.044 --> 41:02.129
I'm like,

41:03.088 --> 41:06.508
"We used to play a game
called 'Red Rover, Red Rover,'

41:07.301 --> 41:09.052
where you would hold hands
with another kid

41:09.136 --> 41:14.308
and just pray that your wrist
didn't snap off your fucking body."

41:14.391 --> 41:18.187
That is a move
that's illegal in the NFL, it's illegal.

41:18.896 --> 41:22.733
It's called the flying wedge.
We played it every day at recess, dude.

41:22.816 --> 41:23.901
Red Rover, dude.

41:23.984 --> 41:28.030
And then the kid with the metal-bar cast,
they let him play!

41:28.113 --> 41:30.407
[laughter and applause]

41:32.659 --> 41:35.871
The kids are fine.
I've heard every argument.

41:35.954 --> 41:37.998
I've yet to hear an argument
that really convinces me

41:38.081 --> 41:41.084
that the kids are in any real trouble,
but people will still fight with me.

41:41.168 --> 41:43.128
They'll be like, "Whitney,
it's the social media,

41:43.212 --> 41:46.632
it traumatizes the children,
it's psychologically traumatizing."

41:46.715 --> 41:48.175
I'm like, "Hmm, when I was five,

41:48.258 --> 41:51.595
my parents showed me a movie
called Old Yeller."

41:51.678 --> 41:52.679
[laughter]

41:52.763 --> 41:56.141
"And then I had to read a book
called Where the Red Fern Grows."

41:56.225 --> 42:00.562
"Feel like all those alive puppies
on TikTok are probably fine."

42:00.646 --> 42:04.358
This is a big one, "Wendy, they could go
on the Internet and get misinformation."

42:05.817 --> 42:07.319
That's all we got.

42:08.028 --> 42:11.823
My mom used to tell me that
when the ice-cream truck played music,

42:11.907 --> 42:15.035
that meant it was out of ice cream.

42:15.118 --> 42:18.121
[laughter and applause]

42:22.000 --> 42:24.503
Do you know how fucked up that is?

42:24.586 --> 42:27.673
We got misinformation in the form of lies.

42:27.756 --> 42:30.133
From people
that were supposed to love us.

42:30.217 --> 42:32.386
I remember on the way home
from school, I'd be like,

42:32.469 --> 42:33.971
"Mom, can we stop at McDonald's?"

42:34.096 --> 42:37.224
She'd be like,
"Sorry, baby, it's closed."

42:38.183 --> 42:39.893
Like, "Aw, man!"

42:40.435 --> 42:43.272
Try pulling that shit with a kid today.
Good luck.

42:43.355 --> 42:44.940
Be like, "Mom, I wanna go to McDonald's."

42:45.023 --> 42:47.234
She'll be like,
"Sorry, baby, it's closed."

42:50.195 --> 42:53.448
"Bitch, that's a 24-hour McDonald's."

42:54.199 --> 42:58.370
"And if you don't take me right now,
I will tweet that you molest me."

42:58.453 --> 43:02.541
"So… your move, baby girl."

43:03.333 --> 43:05.836
"Your move." [giggles]

43:10.132 --> 43:13.886
I've just heard every argument,
and I feel like it's a little overblown.

43:13.969 --> 43:17.181
What I hear is about how kids, all they do
is take pictures of themselves.

43:17.264 --> 43:20.309
"They just take pictures of themselves,
they take selfies all day long."

43:20.392 --> 43:21.351
Who gives a shit?

43:21.435 --> 43:23.395
We're just jealous, I think we're jealous

43:23.478 --> 43:27.858
because we got one photo a year.

43:29.401 --> 43:30.652
We had a day.

43:30.736 --> 43:33.488
It was called "Photo Day."

43:35.949 --> 43:39.703
It was our only opportunity in a year
to get proof of our existence,

43:39.786 --> 43:44.875
and we had to wait in line for five hours,

43:44.958 --> 43:49.129
holding an envelope full of change?

43:54.092 --> 43:57.054
You would get to the front of the line,
you had one shot, dude.

43:57.137 --> 43:58.847
They'd be like, "All right, say cheese!"

43:58.931 --> 44:00.724
[imitates shutter] "I think I blinked!"

44:00.807 --> 44:04.061
He'd be like, "Sorry, brace face,
see you next October."

44:04.186 --> 44:07.314
Kids now, they can get eight tries
till they get a good one.

44:07.397 --> 44:13.987
We got eight sizes
of the same shitty photo.

44:15.781 --> 44:18.617
What were those sizes?

44:19.743 --> 44:22.913
I remember being with my mom
in the Walmart frame section,

44:22.996 --> 44:23.914
she's in tears.

44:23.997 --> 44:26.583
She's like, "What's this one?
What is this, a 9x1?"

44:26.708 --> 44:30.462
"I don't even-- is this a bookmark?
I don't know what that was."

44:30.546 --> 44:33.423
"What's this tiny little one?
Is this for a locket?"

44:33.507 --> 44:37.427
"I paid 74 nickels for this bullshit!"

44:41.223 --> 44:44.726
I think we have to use
critical thinking on this stuff, you know?

44:44.810 --> 44:47.354
I know it's insensitive sometimes to say,
but people will be like,

44:47.437 --> 44:49.857
"Whitney, the phones,
they are really toxic for the kids."

44:49.940 --> 44:54.319
"The filters on Instagram,
they give the kids body dysmorphia."

44:54.403 --> 44:56.864
Okay, I have body dysmorphia

44:56.947 --> 44:59.575
'cause we used to xerox our faces.

44:59.658 --> 45:02.578
I've never seen myself before
because I fried my retina

45:02.661 --> 45:04.538
on the surface of the fuckin' sun,

45:04.621 --> 45:07.875
'cause that was the only way
to get a selfie back in my day.

45:07.958 --> 45:10.836
And then we would play with something
called "pin art," you remember that?

45:10.919 --> 45:12.880
It was the red frame
with all the little needles in it,

45:12.963 --> 45:16.049
and you put your-- put your hand,
the outline, and your hand would go--

45:16.133 --> 45:19.553
We'd put it on our face!

45:19.636 --> 45:21.638
[laughter and applause]

45:21.722 --> 45:25.976
My generation needs filters
to cover up the tetanus scars

45:26.059 --> 45:30.147
from jamming our head into a box of nails.

45:33.775 --> 45:34.610
[sighs]

45:34.693 --> 45:36.278
[applause]

45:44.077 --> 45:46.163
I just think it might be
the best-case scenario.

45:46.288 --> 45:48.290
You can't let kids get bored,
and when kids get bored,

45:48.373 --> 45:49.958
they do dumb shit, that's it.

45:50.042 --> 45:53.629
Like before phones,
for our main form of amusement,

45:53.712 --> 45:56.173
we used to walk around the mall.

45:57.925 --> 46:00.219
For five hours.

46:01.053 --> 46:03.096
With no money.

46:04.223 --> 46:08.018
You know some bad ideas
are gonna bubble up at some point.

46:08.101 --> 46:10.646
Twenty minutes in,
we'd be like, "Oh, my God!"

46:10.729 --> 46:12.147
[groans]

46:12.231 --> 46:14.233
"Should we just get in the van
with that guy?"

46:16.068 --> 46:17.694
"Like, what's the worst
that's gonna happen?"

46:17.819 --> 46:19.279
"He's got candy."

46:19.363 --> 46:22.741
Like, that was our Candy Crush,
just a guy

46:22.866 --> 46:26.328
in the Penney's parking lot
with Werther's Originals.

46:33.835 --> 46:35.712
Wearing that exact shirt.

46:35.837 --> 46:37.214
Um…

46:37.965 --> 46:40.551
No, I just feel like
it's just so odd to me,

46:40.634 --> 46:43.136
like when people come up to me
after I talk about this stuff.

46:43.220 --> 46:46.682
They'll come up to me, like,
"What did your parents think of all that?"

46:47.474 --> 46:48.934
They didn't.

46:49.017 --> 46:51.228
Our parents had no idea
what we were doing.

46:51.353 --> 46:53.021
My mom used to say to my face,

46:53.105 --> 46:56.483
"Go out and play.
Come back before dark."

46:57.484 --> 47:00.195
Kids don't know when it's gonna get dark.

47:01.321 --> 47:05.409
Gets dark, and they're like,
"Fuck, it's dark!"

47:05.492 --> 47:07.119
"Noooo!"

47:10.539 --> 47:14.668
"This happens every night!
It's always a surprise!"

47:18.797 --> 47:22.301
And then we would just have to
Blair Witch Project our way home.

47:22.384 --> 47:24.344
Eventually we'd find a pay phone,

47:24.428 --> 47:28.223
and you'd have to pray that your mom
would take a collect call.

47:28.932 --> 47:32.561
You call your mom and you'd be like,
"You have a collect call from--"

47:32.644 --> 47:35.898
"Mom, it's dark! Come find us!"

47:37.482 --> 47:40.360
And then you would just hitchhike and…

47:40.903 --> 47:42.112
that was kind of the deal.

47:42.196 --> 47:44.823
It's wild to think about because
even when our parents were with us,

47:44.948 --> 47:46.450
they had no idea what we were doing.

47:46.533 --> 47:48.911
My mom used to take me
to birthday parties every Sunday,

47:48.994 --> 47:51.330
and we would play in something
called a "bounce house."

47:51.413 --> 47:53.624
Is that what you guys call it
in New Jersey?

47:53.707 --> 47:55.292
Are you sure? You guys seem rich.

47:55.375 --> 47:57.878
Do you call it a "bouncy castle"?
Don't lie to me.

47:57.961 --> 47:59.004
[laughter]

47:59.087 --> 48:01.298
She's like, "Okay, you're right,
I'm a princess."

48:01.423 --> 48:02.925
Um…

48:03.926 --> 48:06.470
So you'd roll up
to the bouncy castle, right?

48:06.553 --> 48:09.806
And I remember, even as a kid,
I always thought that shit was sketchy.

48:09.932 --> 48:12.726
I was like, "I'm just a kid
and I don't know anything about math,

48:12.809 --> 48:14.645
but, like…

48:14.728 --> 48:18.148
there's, like, 70 pairs
of kids' shoes outside,

48:18.941 --> 48:21.568
but only, like, three kids inside."

48:22.945 --> 48:25.405
No maternal alarm bells are going off.

48:25.489 --> 48:27.032
She would just fuckin' leave.

48:27.115 --> 48:29.826
She would leave, and you remember
the screen outside the bounce house?

48:29.952 --> 48:32.204
That was painted over,
she didn't know what was going on.

48:32.287 --> 48:34.122
You guys remember what was going on.

48:34.206 --> 48:37.459
There was always that bully kid
who was, like, hiding in the corner

48:38.544 --> 48:41.797
who had been practicing all day
how to bounce.

48:41.880 --> 48:44.299
He knew every sort of part.

48:45.008 --> 48:47.427
He knew all the soft spots,
he knew how to bounce,

48:47.511 --> 48:50.097
and he would just wait in the corner
for new blood to come in.

48:51.807 --> 48:54.810
You would come in there,
you'd be like, "I'm on the moon!"

48:54.893 --> 48:56.395
Come outta nowhere.

48:56.478 --> 48:59.022
Boom! Bounce you into the air,

48:59.106 --> 49:01.775
down into the crevice
between the floor and the wall

49:01.859 --> 49:06.446
where you would join nine other kids
who had been there for five days,

49:06.530 --> 49:10.325
covered in their own blood and piss.

49:16.248 --> 49:18.083
I don't know.
I'm trying to figure out what to do.

49:18.166 --> 49:20.752
I'm trying to figure out
how to be a good mother.

49:20.836 --> 49:24.756
I'm not a mother, but I am a godmother.
Is anyone a godparent?

49:24.840 --> 49:27.676
-[scattered applause]
-Yeah? It's a fuckin' scam.

49:28.218 --> 49:29.219
It's a racket.

49:29.303 --> 49:32.306
You fall in love with this child and
you have no authority over them at all.

49:32.389 --> 49:34.808
Then you just get yelled at
by the parent, you know?

49:34.892 --> 49:36.185
I get yelled at constantly.

49:36.268 --> 49:38.437
All I do is try to do good things
for this child.

49:38.520 --> 49:39.521
I love her so much.

49:39.605 --> 49:41.398
Every time she comes over,
I get in trouble.

49:41.523 --> 49:43.817
Like recently she came over,
I had gone to a store.

49:43.901 --> 49:45.736
I got all this organic, like, food,

49:45.819 --> 49:48.113
and, like, I made her
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

49:48.197 --> 49:50.324
gluten-free bread, right,
I think I'm in the clear.

49:50.407 --> 49:52.534
And, uh, she comes over,

49:52.618 --> 49:55.579
and there was peanut butter
on the sandwich and…

49:55.662 --> 49:59.291
if you live in California and
you put peanut butter on a sandwich

49:59.374 --> 50:00.751
and it's near a child,

50:00.834 --> 50:04.338
uh, Will Smith just comes out
and punches you in the face.

50:04.421 --> 50:05.714
Um…

50:05.797 --> 50:08.050
-[applause]
-It's like a new law.

50:10.594 --> 50:11.887
So I got in trouble for that.

50:11.970 --> 50:14.264
But then I got some other
fuckin' almond butter thing

50:14.348 --> 50:16.266
and all this organic stuff,
and she's like,

50:16.350 --> 50:18.435
"I need to see the bottle,"
and I was like, "It's organic."

50:18.519 --> 50:21.438
She's like, "Hmm, even a lot
of the organic brands have chemicals."

50:21.522 --> 50:23.065
I was like,

50:24.483 --> 50:27.611
am I the only kid
that drank out of a hose

50:27.694 --> 50:30.197
till I was, like, 14?

50:30.822 --> 50:32.950
Dude, I remember the first time
I went to a restaurant.

50:33.075 --> 50:36.495
They brought me water, I was like,
"Eww, what's this clear shit?"

50:37.371 --> 50:40.958
"I ordered water, the murky stuff
that makes you go night-night?"

50:41.083 --> 50:42.251
"Try again."

50:43.335 --> 50:46.588
"Ecch! I already had to bring
my own paint chips to this shit hole."

50:48.549 --> 50:49.883
I'm always getting in trouble.

50:49.967 --> 50:52.010
I guess I just don't know
how to be a good parent.

50:52.094 --> 50:54.680
There's all this new stuff
you have to, like, know about,

50:54.763 --> 50:57.140
and I just feel like
it's a little bit overkill,

50:57.224 --> 50:59.351
'cause I really try
and I always end up in trouble

50:59.434 --> 51:01.103
every time I try to be in her life.

51:01.186 --> 51:04.106
She recently got into ballet, all right?
She's five years old, she's in ballet.

51:04.189 --> 51:07.192
I'm like, I have to go to the recital
for that 'cause there's nothing cuter

51:07.276 --> 51:11.488
than toddlers in ballet
because they all have, like, beer bellies.

51:11.572 --> 51:12.573
For no reason.

51:12.656 --> 51:15.492
They probably have tapeworms
'cause they only eat fuckin' organic shit.

51:15.576 --> 51:16.994
Just saying. And then…

51:17.119 --> 51:18.453
[laughs]

51:18.537 --> 51:20.163
…their pantyhose never fit, right?

51:20.247 --> 51:23.000
'Cause no one wants to touch their legs
'cause it's too awkward,

51:23.125 --> 51:24.960
so they all have like ball sacks
on their knees

51:25.043 --> 51:27.546
and they're just like
these stupid little sumo wrestlers

51:27.629 --> 51:30.757
knocking into each other, so I was like,
"I have to go to that, that's hilarious."

51:30.841 --> 51:35.137
And I did not get in trouble until
the freakin' end after it's over, right?

51:35.220 --> 51:37.723
I didn't say anything,
I didn't talk about the ball sacks.

51:37.806 --> 51:40.517
I totally behaved myself.

51:40.601 --> 51:42.811
And then after the show,
I went up to my goddaughter,

51:42.895 --> 51:45.397
and I was like,
"Olivia, you did such a good job

51:45.480 --> 51:48.317
and you looked so pretty in your outfit."

51:48.400 --> 51:50.861
My friend pulls me aside,
she goes, "Whitney, get over here!"

51:51.695 --> 51:53.780
"We don't say she's pretty."

51:55.032 --> 51:57.659
"We say she's smart."

51:59.328 --> 52:00.829
I was like, "Okay."

52:05.000 --> 52:06.376
"But she's not."

52:06.460 --> 52:09.963
[laughter and applause]

52:10.047 --> 52:11.381
"I am happy to lie."

52:11.465 --> 52:15.052
"I'm trying to understand what we're doing
'cause the spelling bee's down the hall."

52:15.177 --> 52:17.679
"Maybe we can plié down
to the spelling bee

52:18.430 --> 52:20.516
'cause your kid can't fuckin' read yet

52:20.599 --> 52:22.601
'cause you let her choose
her own classes."

52:22.684 --> 52:23.810
"How am I the asshole?"

52:23.894 --> 52:26.271
"You're the one that bought lingerie
for your baby."

52:26.355 --> 52:27.773
"How am I…?"

52:28.440 --> 52:30.943
"I just watched you put mascara
on your toddler in the parking lot."

52:31.026 --> 52:32.402
"I feel like we're even."

52:35.072 --> 52:36.740
She goes, "Whitney,
you don't understand."

52:36.823 --> 52:39.409
"There is an epidemic in this country

52:39.493 --> 52:41.286
of girls that define themselves

52:41.370 --> 52:45.582
through their appearance
over their intelligence."

52:45.707 --> 52:48.460
I was like… "That sounds true."

52:56.802 --> 53:00.472
"But there's also an epidemic

53:00.556 --> 53:03.517
of hot girls who think they're smart."

53:03.600 --> 53:05.853
[laughter and applause]

53:07.145 --> 53:09.606
"What are we gonna do about that?"

53:10.107 --> 53:12.985
"You can make a difference today."

53:14.778 --> 53:16.697
No, I'm always
getting in trouble with her.

53:16.780 --> 53:19.825
I have very strong feelings
about stuff 'cause I love her.

53:19.908 --> 53:23.996
She's in ballet, and I feel like a toddler
in ballet, totally fine, it's cute,

53:24.079 --> 53:27.165
but I feel like, as a girl,
you cut ballet off at, what, like ten?

53:27.249 --> 53:28.667
Eight, ten.

53:28.750 --> 53:31.169
I basically said to her,
"I don't think that toddlers

53:31.295 --> 53:32.921
need to keep doing ballet later."

53:33.005 --> 53:35.632
Like, I don't think
anything should exist today

53:35.757 --> 53:38.343
if you can't sell it right now
as a brand-new idea.

53:38.427 --> 53:41.138
I get why ballet was entertaining
like 400 years ago,

53:41.221 --> 53:43.682
but I don't think
it needs to still be a business

53:43.765 --> 53:45.058
based on what we now know.

53:45.142 --> 53:48.353
Imagine trying to sell ballet
as a brand-new concept

53:48.437 --> 53:50.355
to a Broadway producer right now.

53:50.439 --> 53:53.066
You'd be like,
"Hey, I have this idea for a show."

53:53.150 --> 53:54.443
"It's a dance show."

53:54.526 --> 53:57.362
"It's about 20 18-year-old girls."

53:57.446 --> 54:01.992
"They dance for about two hours
in underwear."

54:03.535 --> 54:07.664
They'll be like, "Brrr, I'm sorry,
is that like a burlesque-type show?"

54:07.789 --> 54:09.208
"Not at all."

54:09.333 --> 54:12.461
"They don't have tits or asses

54:13.212 --> 54:16.507
because we starve them."

54:18.175 --> 54:23.514
"And their toes look like curly fries
for the rest of their life."

54:29.394 --> 54:32.898
They'd be like, "Uhh… I'm sorry,
I'm just trying to understand this show."

54:32.981 --> 54:35.442
"So it's just women,
there's no men in the show?"

54:35.526 --> 54:37.611
"Oh, my God, totally forgot to tell you."

54:37.694 --> 54:39.988
"Yes, there is one man in the show."

54:40.072 --> 54:43.909
"He is like 30 and he's the one
that holds them up

54:43.992 --> 54:45.577
by their pussies."

54:50.958 --> 54:54.002
"Sorry, I'm just trying
to wrap my head around this idea."

54:54.086 --> 54:56.797
"Um, so they're just in underwear?
Is that the only--"

54:56.880 --> 54:58.549
"Oh, forgot to tell you."

54:58.632 --> 55:02.052
"Of course they're not just in underwear.
We have skirts for them, obviously."

55:02.135 --> 55:06.807
"But we figured out a way
to make them go straight out."

55:07.432 --> 55:10.269
"So you can still see
everything you need to see."

55:10.394 --> 55:11.478
[clicks tongue]

55:14.064 --> 55:16.441
"I'm sorry, I'm just-- [splutters]
I'm not getting it."

55:16.525 --> 55:19.111
"Do you want to just, I don't know,
show me the dance moves?"

55:19.194 --> 55:21.405
She's like,
"No problem, it's very simple."

55:21.488 --> 55:23.031
"They just show their pussies…

55:27.744 --> 55:28.829
from every angle."

55:40.465 --> 55:43.010
"Their pussies fly.
They're making the pussies fly."

55:43.677 --> 55:47.264
"And then they just present their pussies

55:48.682 --> 55:51.143
to everyone in the audience."

55:51.226 --> 55:52.769
"One by one."

55:55.981 --> 56:00.444
"You know how you blow kisses at people?
They just blow their pussies at people."

56:01.069 --> 56:03.530
"Don't worry, we don't let them smile."

56:03.614 --> 56:05.991
"Make sure they have no joy
behind their eyes."

56:07.451 --> 56:10.078
You can have one, of course, sir.
Of course.

56:13.749 --> 56:15.918
Ballet is a wild show!

56:16.793 --> 56:17.794
It's a wild show.

56:17.878 --> 56:20.297
You know a show's creepy
when they give the audience binoculars.

56:20.422 --> 56:22.257
Like, why do they have binoculars?

56:25.135 --> 56:28.430
Why do the binoculars have one handle bar?
