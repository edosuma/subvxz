00:02.870 --> 00:04.105
Hello, John. Rosalind.

00:04.138 --> 00:06.207
You know,
I follow Bailey on Instagram.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.110
Rosalind is out of pocket.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.511
Repeat,
Rosalind has escaped.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.780
But I just wanted to make sure
someone checked on Lucy.

00:12.813 --> 00:13.814
What have you done?

00:13.847 --> 00:15.083
He still has a pulse.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.085
Something
that's been helping me more.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.253
An online group
that's hunting Rosalind.

00:19.287 --> 00:20.621
"Don't give Rosalind
the satisfaction.

00:20.654 --> 00:23.257
She eats her victim's pain
like a five-star meal."

00:23.291 --> 00:25.293
I reviewed all of
TruthHunter's messages.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.861
The forensic linguistics
are a match to Rosalind Dyer.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.297
Sgt. Grey:
Their cyber crime people

00:29.330 --> 00:31.965
traced the web
of Rosalind's I.P. addresses

00:31.999 --> 00:33.667
to a house
outside Seattle.

You know, just once,
I'd love a quiet,

00:51.985 --> 00:53.787
kitten-in-a-tree
kind of day.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.056
No, you wouldn't.
You're an adrenaline junkie.

Fire department!
Anybody here?!

01:35.196 --> 01:36.830
Check upstairs.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.499
Go around back.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.779
Look, if there's
any squatters in here,

01:51.812 --> 01:53.314
that doesn't matter to us.

01:53.347 --> 01:56.417
We got a call about
a medical emergency.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.286
Help.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.556
Help me.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.633
Is anyone in here?

02:27.415 --> 02:29.583
Ow.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.584
What the...

02:41.529 --> 02:42.496
Rosalind.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.233
Help!

02:49.803 --> 02:51.905
So, what time
were you born?

02:51.939 --> 02:53.574
Uh, I have no idea.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.477
All I know is that the birth
was exhausting and traumatic,

02:56.510 --> 02:59.480
and I hear the story
every time my mom wants money.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.081
This for an astrology thing?

03:01.114 --> 03:02.616
Nope.

03:04.318 --> 03:07.421
Fine.
It's for an astrology thing.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.589
Listen, we ride together.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.190
If you suffer trauma,
so do I, okay?

03:10.224 --> 03:12.693
I should be checking
your chart daily.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.496
I'm so glad you're sharing your
beliefs more openly these days.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.497
Yeah, it's nice, right?

03:20.100 --> 03:21.068
<i>Hey.</i>

03:21.101 --> 03:23.271
Hey. I-I-I'm in trouble.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.872
Bailey, where are you?
What happened?

03:24.905 --> 03:28.676
I fell into some kind of trap.
I think it's Rosalind.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.910
<i>Bailey?!</i>

03:30.811 --> 03:32.580
I'm down here!

03:32.613 --> 03:33.847
Bailey?

03:33.881 --> 03:35.283
Hold on. Hold on.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.850
We're gonna try
and get this grate open.

03:41.822 --> 03:42.990
No, no, no, no! Wait!

03:46.527 --> 03:48.095
Marlon, stop!

03:50.831 --> 03:51.965
Bailey, what happened?

03:54.234 --> 03:57.371
Oh, my God.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.807
Sgt. Grey:
Harper, Lopez.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.075
Uh-oh.
This doesn't sound good.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.077
We think that Rosalind
has Bailey

04:04.111 --> 04:05.613
trapped
in a house in the valley.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.180
A firefighter has
been electrocuted.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.382
Get there.
Take point.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.050
What do you mean trapped?
Is Rosalind on site?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.885
I don't know.
It just happened.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.087
I guess it was too much to hope
we'd never see her again.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.489
Yeah.

04:27.735 --> 04:28.869
Start a perimeter.

04:28.902 --> 04:29.970
<i>Are you sure
it's Rosalind?</i>

04:30.003 --> 04:31.972
I'm not sure
of anything yet.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.109
Is he alright?
Yeah, we got him stabilized,

04:36.143 --> 04:37.478
but he's got
third-degree burns.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.246
<i>Bailey's over here.</i>

04:39.279 --> 04:40.280
Has the house been cleared?

04:40.314 --> 04:42.015
Yeah. 911 call was a setup.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.484
You don't want
to touch the lid.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.052
There's at least 5,000 volts
running through it.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.496
Hey. You alright?

04:55.529 --> 04:57.965
I'm okay. I twisted my ankle
when I landed,

04:57.998 --> 04:59.232
but it's not too bad.

04:59.266 --> 05:00.401
Okay, we're gonna get you
out of there.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.902
I know.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.871
Electrified or not, we can still
cut through this grate

05:03.904 --> 05:04.805
so long
as we're not grounded.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.607
No, I wouldn't do that.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.409
I don't think this is
the only booby trap.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.610
Look.

05:19.286 --> 05:20.654
What the hell are those?

05:20.688 --> 05:22.423
It could be packed
with explosives.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.091
Or spiders.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.361
I mean, I'm not saying
it's likely-- but yuck.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.196
Whatever it is, we can't tell
what they are

05:29.229 --> 05:31.064
without examining them
more closely,

05:31.098 --> 05:33.200
and we can't do that with this
electrified grate in the way.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.406
Well, I'd offer to come up
and help, but there's no way.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.273
DWP's working on cutting
the power to the house.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.647
Uh, alright, Bailey,

05:46.680 --> 05:48.048
I just need, uh, Tim
for a minute,

05:48.081 --> 05:49.216
and I'll be right back.

05:49.249 --> 05:50.217
Okay.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.351
I'll stay here with her.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.219
Yeah, me too.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.259
Great.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.295
What are we doing?
We have to assume

06:02.329 --> 06:04.264
the entire house
is bugged with cameras,

06:04.297 --> 06:05.999
and anything we do
to try to get her out

06:06.033 --> 06:07.701
will provoke a reaction.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.604
From what I can tell,
there's some kind of steel tank

06:10.638 --> 06:11.905
under the floor
of the living room.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.240
I didn't see
a basement door anywhere.

06:13.273 --> 06:15.242
I bet she walled it off
so we couldn't get down there.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.510
We need to get access
to that basement.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.512
Well, it should be simple enough
to cut through the floor,

06:18.546 --> 06:20.313
but we have to be able
to cover the cameras

06:20.347 --> 06:22.015
without letting on that
we know that they're there.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.385
Hi.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.887
We're assuming Rosalind
bugged the house?

06:26.920 --> 06:28.055
We know
that she likes to watch.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.857
We're taking point
on the investigation.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.659
W-What's going on?
Is-- Is Bailey okay?

06:31.692 --> 06:33.160
Yeah, for now.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.996
Look, Rosalind did not buy
this trap at Home Depot.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.631
Way too much time,
effort, and material

06:37.665 --> 06:38.699
went into
the construction.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.800
She didn't do this alone.

06:39.833 --> 06:40.901
She doesn't have
the skill set

06:40.934 --> 06:41.702
to pull off
something this elaborate.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.971
Another acolyte-- great.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.573
It would be helpful
if you could put together

06:45.606 --> 06:46.807
a list
of building materials.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.208
If we can source them,
we might have

06:48.241 --> 06:49.710
a shot at identifying
who bought them.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.912
Yeah, I can do that.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.481
Hi.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.649
I've been doing some thinking,
and Rosalind is not

06:55.683 --> 06:57.618
the construction type, so
she must have a new acolyte--

06:57.651 --> 07:00.087
someone she recruited
through Beth or Caleb.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.655
Or--

07:01.689 --> 07:03.356
Did you guys figure
this out already?

07:03.390 --> 07:05.626
Yeah. We're gonna need
to check out the scene

07:05.659 --> 07:07.360
and then head back to the
station and start digging in--

07:07.394 --> 07:10.430
see if we can find any other
cases that have a similar M.O.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.165
Can we take Aaron
to run down leads?

07:12.199 --> 07:13.433
Of course.
I'll stay here and run point.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.102
I'd like to stay, too,
and make sure that Bailey's

07:15.135 --> 07:16.504
never down there by herself.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.705
Thank you.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.507
Mm-hmm.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.241
Let's go.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.446
Alright. It's getting
a little crowded in here.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.448
Authorized personnel only.

07:28.482 --> 07:29.750
And we need more light
to work.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.785
I'll be out front. Alright.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.086
Having fun yet?

07:33.120 --> 07:35.188
I feel like an animal
in a zoo.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.157
You get blueprints
for this house yet?

07:37.190 --> 07:38.826
Yeah. Permits is pulling
the plans right now.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.227
Well, a lot of this work
wasn't permitted.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.662
It's not gonna be in
the county records.

07:41.695 --> 07:42.996
Unless we're needed
here, we--

07:43.030 --> 07:44.397
No, no, we're good.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.465
You and Lopez have enough
on your plate.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.967
Just find out
who built this.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.902
On it.
Bailey, hang in there, okay?

07:48.936 --> 07:50.571
Half the city is trying
to get you out of there.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.039
Alright. Thanks.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.717
There. You got a 10-foot
blind spot right there.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.529
Guys?!

08:16.797 --> 08:18.065
What is it?

08:18.098 --> 08:19.633
I-I don't know.
Something's happening.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.671
Spikes! There are spikes
coming out of the ground!

08:23.704 --> 08:26.106
Stop, stop! Stop cutting!
Stop cutting!

08:26.139 --> 08:28.576
You okay?
Yeah, I'm great.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.477
Just... great.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.783
Do you think Rosalind
saw us cutting?

08:35.816 --> 08:37.284
No, I think
more than likely

08:37.317 --> 08:39.452
there's a motion sensor,
probably under the floor.

08:39.486 --> 08:40.453
Where we can't
get at it.

08:40.487 --> 08:41.855
No, we can. We can.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.291
We just have to take the floor
apart more carefully.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.826
You mean "slowly."
Right.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.695
Alright, guys.
DWP is here.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.062
They're cutting the power.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.030
No.
No, that could trigger
something else.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.031
Shh, shh.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.367
The lights are still on.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.069
There's got to be
a generator, then.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.841
Guys.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.275
Something else
is happening.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.615
What is it?

09:09.182 --> 09:13.453
John, something else is
happening!

09:13.486 --> 09:14.855
Can you block it?

09:20.861 --> 09:22.596
Water is filling up
the tank.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.566
I can't stop it!

09:26.600 --> 09:28.101
How long until
the tank fills up?

09:28.135 --> 09:30.771
At this rate,
a few hours, max.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.772
Ohh.

09:34.675 --> 09:35.976
Yeah.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.044
<i>Hello, John.</i>

09:44.084 --> 09:46.787
<i>Alert anyone that I'm on
the phone and Bailey dies.</i>

09:48.588 --> 09:50.190
What?

09:50.223 --> 09:51.859
It's Grey.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.264
Bailey, I'll be right back.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.465
Really?

10:03.937 --> 10:06.640
<i>Cute trick with the work
lights, but it won't matter.</i>

10:06.674 --> 10:09.109
<i>Nothing they can do
will get to her in time.</i>

10:09.142 --> 10:11.411
<i>You're the only one
who can save Bailey.</i>

10:11.444 --> 10:12.412
How?

10:12.445 --> 10:15.182
<i>Hand yourself over to me.</i>

10:15.215 --> 10:16.984
So you can kill us both?
I don't think so.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.786
<i>It's the only way
she survives.</i>

10:18.819 --> 10:20.954
<i>A trade-- you for her.</i>

10:22.389 --> 10:24.692
<i>And the offer expires
in five seconds.</i>

10:24.725 --> 10:26.059
<i>Four, three--</i>

10:26.093 --> 10:27.094
Wait.

10:28.595 --> 10:29.596
I'm coming.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.298
<i>Smart choice.</i>

10:31.331 --> 10:33.300
<i>Take off your body cam.
Put it in your pocket.</i>

10:37.537 --> 10:38.706
Where do I go?

10:38.739 --> 10:40.473
<i>Walk down the driveway
and make a left.</i>

10:40.507 --> 10:42.843
<i>As long as you do
exactly as I say,</i>

10:42.876 --> 10:45.645
<i>Bailey has
a chance to survive.</i>

10:45.679 --> 10:47.647
Why are you doing this?

10:47.681 --> 10:49.482
You got away.

10:49.516 --> 10:52.352
Coming back to L.A.
was a bad move.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.755
<i>Goes to show how much
I missed you.</i>

10:54.788 --> 10:56.656
<i>You should be flattered.</i>

10:56.690 --> 10:57.858
<i>Blue station wagon.</i>

11:00.728 --> 11:02.629
<i>Time to strip.</i>

11:02.662 --> 11:04.064
<i>Take off your belt, badge,
and weapons.</i>

11:04.097 --> 11:06.199
<i>Turn your pockets inside out.</i>

11:06.233 --> 11:09.636
I'm not leaving my gun here
for some kid to find.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.039
<i>I thought you'd be more focused
than this.</i>

11:12.072 --> 11:14.607
<i>Find a way.</i>

11:36.997 --> 11:39.032
<i>And your backup piece.</i>

11:52.112 --> 11:54.381
<i>Say hello to Creepy Bear.</i>

11:54.414 --> 11:55.648
<i>Now you have someone
to talk to.</i>

11:58.886 --> 12:02.222
<i>Very good.
See how intuitive you are?</i>

12:02.255 --> 12:03.891
<i>Now throw your old phone
out the window.</i>

12:03.924 --> 12:05.425
<i>The Bluetooth
in your friendly bear</i>

12:05.458 --> 12:06.827
<i>should kick in any...</i>

12:06.860 --> 12:08.896
<i>...second now.</i>

12:08.929 --> 12:11.999
<i>See? Perfect. Now drive.</i>

12:12.032 --> 12:13.767
No.
<i>Excuse me?</i>

12:13.801 --> 12:16.837
I did something for you.
I did what you wanted.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.371
Now you give me something.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.441
<i>Negotiating?
Hmm, I do love a bargain.</i>

12:21.474 --> 12:23.643
<i>Fine. There's an app
on your phone. Open it.</i>

12:29.716 --> 12:31.651
<i>Do you know why
they blindfold prisoners</i>

12:31.684 --> 12:33.486
<i>in the electric chair?</i>

12:33.520 --> 12:35.155
No.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.590
<i>Because when the executioner
sends 2,000 volts</i>

12:37.624 --> 12:38.859
<i>into a prisoner,</i>

12:38.892 --> 12:41.761
<i>their eyes pop out
of their heads.</i>

12:41.795 --> 12:44.431
<i>Now drive.
Bailey's running out of time.</i>

13:00.480 --> 13:01.849
Hey. Any sign
of the generator?

13:01.882 --> 13:03.783
No. DWP thinks it's buried somewhere.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.252
They're bringing in
ground-penetrating radar.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.087
Even if we find it,
how can we be sure

13:07.120 --> 13:09.589
that shutting it off won't
trigger some other booby trap?

13:09.622 --> 13:10.690
We can't.

13:10.723 --> 13:11.892
Have you seen Nolan?

13:11.925 --> 13:14.261
No.
He's not answering his phone
or his radio.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.064
W-- That's--
Nolan would never leave Bailey.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.298
Something's not right.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.300
7-Adam-15,
what's your status?

13:20.333 --> 13:21.268
<i>7-Adam-15,
what's your status?</i>

13:24.737 --> 13:25.973
7-Adam-15, please report.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.507
<i>7-Adam-15, please report.</i>

13:27.540 --> 13:29.376
I think I hear his radio.
Can you do that again?

13:29.409 --> 13:31.845
7-Adam-15, are you there?
<i>7-Adam-15, are you there?</i>

13:31.879 --> 13:34.014
Nolan. 7-Adam-15.
<i>Nolan. 7-Adam-15.</i>

13:34.047 --> 13:35.382
Hey, where are you?
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

13:35.415 --> 13:37.985
7-Adam-15, report.
<i>7-Adam-15, report.</i>

13:38.018 --> 13:40.888
Okay. Okay, hey, can you guys
just please shut up

13:40.921 --> 13:42.355
and turn off your radios?!

13:45.692 --> 13:47.360
7-Adam-15,
what's your status?

13:47.394 --> 13:48.428
<i>7-Adam-15,
what's your status?</i>

13:50.297 --> 13:51.698
7-Adam-15. Nolan.
<i>7-Adam-15. Nolan.</i>

13:51.731 --> 13:53.366
Nolan, this is Lucy.
<i>Nolan, this is Lucy.</i>

13:53.400 --> 13:54.667
We're trying to locate you.
<i>We're trying to locate you.</i>

13:54.701 --> 13:56.369
Are you there?
<i>Are you there?</i>

13:56.403 --> 13:57.570
Nolan, please answer.
<i>Nolan, please answer.</i>

14:02.709 --> 14:04.511
I don't understand. Why would
he just leave all his gear?

14:07.714 --> 14:09.449
Nolan is on his way
to see Rosalind.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.218
He took a call.
It had to have been from her.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.653
She's using Bailey
to get Nolan to go see her.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.055
How long has he been gone?

14:15.088 --> 14:17.257
I mean, it can't be more
than like 10, 15 minutes.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.259
Alright. I'll alert Grey.
Nolan's smart.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.427
He'll think of a way
to signal us.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.831
<i>You're doing great, John.</i>

14:24.864 --> 14:26.699
<i>Make a left at the stop sign.</i>

14:26.733 --> 14:29.036
So this is how you spend
your time out of prison,

14:29.069 --> 14:30.470
planning all this?

14:30.503 --> 14:33.606
Why not just tan
on a beach in Fiji?

14:33.640 --> 14:36.009
<i>I'm not really
a sun person.</i>

14:36.043 --> 14:38.645
<i>Besides, solitary confinement
gave me all the time I needed</i>

14:38.678 --> 14:40.113
<i>to think this through,</i>

14:40.147 --> 14:42.082
<i>down to disabling
the hazard lights.</i>

14:51.324 --> 14:53.793
This wasn't all you.

14:53.826 --> 14:54.827
You had help.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.230
<i>I did. He's very clever.</i>

14:57.264 --> 14:59.699
<i>A cut above the blunt
instruments I've used before.</i>

15:05.438 --> 15:06.873
I got a problem--
a road rager.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.475
This guy just cut me off.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.443
<i>'Cause you brake checked him...</i>
What the hell, man?!

15:10.477 --> 15:12.912
<i>...trying to alert your friends
without me noticing.</i>
What are you doing?

15:12.946 --> 15:14.547
<i>I'm disappointed in you, John.</i>
Come on, let's go! Now!

15:14.581 --> 15:15.615
<i>Now Bailey is going
to be punished.</i>

15:15.648 --> 15:17.350
No, no, wait.
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.389
Uh, guys,
one of the boxes is opening.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.502
Okay. Okay. Stop, stop.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.712
<i>Potassium amide,
a chemical that hates water.</i>

15:45.745 --> 15:46.980
Get out of the car!

15:47.014 --> 15:48.348
<i>A few flakes
is a fun party trick,</i>

15:48.381 --> 15:50.817
<i>but there's enough in there
to blow the whole tank.</i>

15:50.850 --> 15:53.686
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.
I promise.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.355
Let's go!
<i>Get rid of that guy.</i>

15:55.388 --> 15:56.889
<i>But you do anything
to alert him,</i>

15:56.923 --> 15:59.192
<i>and I'll cook her to death.</i>

16:01.128 --> 16:03.096
Now you wanna be a tough guy,
huh? You want to throw down?

16:03.130 --> 16:05.565
Let's go. What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do? Nothing.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.674
You happy?

16:14.707 --> 16:16.576
I just assaulted that guy.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.646
<i>Hmm, it was self-defense,
and it's your own damn fault.</i>

16:19.679 --> 16:21.781
<i>Now drive.
You're running late.</i>

16:34.827 --> 16:36.196
You okay, Bailey?

16:36.229 --> 16:39.266
Yeah. This isn't the first time
I've singed my eyebrows.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.400
They grow back.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.337
Is John there?

16:46.873 --> 16:48.141
Lucy, where's John?

16:49.709 --> 16:53.180
He's outside with the engineers,
looking for the generator.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.014
Putting that construction
knowledge to good use.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.420
You held your breath
for a long time.

17:00.453 --> 17:03.556
Well, death by fire
is a great motivator.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.292
Plus, I did some competitive
diving in my youth.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.294
Of course you did.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.961
I wish I could say
that was the last time

17:08.995 --> 17:10.463
you were gonna need
to use that skill.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.965
Yeah.

17:12.999 --> 17:16.069
What's the longest anyone's
ever held their breath?

17:16.103 --> 17:19.038
Yeah, let's check.
Uh, let's see.

17:19.072 --> 17:22.509
24 minutes and 37 seconds.
But he cheated.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.512
I mean, he took in pure oxygen
before getting in the water.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.979
Let's do a test

17:27.013 --> 17:28.748
to see how long
I can hold my breath for, okay?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.230
Sgt. Grey:
Yeah. Alright.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.099
We just got a Nolan sighting.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.435
Smitty responded
to a road-rage incident.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.703
Said a guy in a Porsche
got knocked out by a guy

17:50.737 --> 17:52.772
in an old blue station wagon.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.208
He left Nolan's
business card behind.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.244
I've got
an airship heading to the area

17:57.277 --> 17:59.212
and all available units
looking for the station wagon.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.654
<i>Now, now,
don't be mad at Creepy Bear.</i>

18:07.687 --> 18:09.689
<i>He's trying to help you.</i>

18:09.722 --> 18:13.426
I'm not mad. I'm tense.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.095
It would help me relax a little
if you'd just let Bailey go.

18:16.129 --> 18:19.299
I promise I'll still meet
with you wherever you want.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.768
<i>Ah, so brave. So willing.
So late.</i>

18:21.801 --> 18:23.002
<i>You better hurry, John.</i>

18:23.035 --> 18:23.970
<i>The next hoop
you have to jump through</i>

18:24.003 --> 18:25.037
<i>is half a mile north.</i>

18:25.071 --> 18:26.373
What is it?

18:26.406 --> 18:27.574
<i>I'm not going to
tell you that.</i>

18:27.607 --> 18:28.808
<i>But if you're not there
in one minute,</i>

18:28.841 --> 18:31.778
<i>Bailey is going to suffer.</i>

18:37.850 --> 18:39.286
<i>Airship-2.</i>

18:39.319 --> 18:42.155
<i>I have a visual
on the blue station wagon.</i>

18:42.189 --> 18:45.292
<i>Make a right into that parking
garage with the blue sign.</i>

18:45.325 --> 18:48.261
<i>The target is entering parking
garage at Sixth and Ocean.</i>

18:48.295 --> 18:49.496
<i>I'm losing visual.</i>

18:49.529 --> 18:51.698
I need all available units,
parking garage,

18:51.731 --> 18:53.200
Sixth and Ocean.

22:17.637 --> 22:18.838
Okay.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.604
Alright, it's clear.

22:59.679 --> 23:02.582
Okay. Now what?

23:02.615 --> 23:04.383
I don't know.

23:04.417 --> 23:05.852
I was hoping the waterline
would be above ground

23:05.885 --> 23:09.088

At the rate
that it's filling up,

23:12.792 --> 23:14.160
she's got an hour, tops.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.397
I found something.

23:18.431 --> 23:21.468
Johnson County Sheriff's report
on an abduction two years ago.

23:21.501 --> 23:22.669
Johnson County,
California?

23:22.702 --> 23:23.470
Colorado.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.880
<i>Dispatch,
we have an unidentified female</i>

23:33.913 --> 23:34.981
<i>in need of assistance.</i>

23:36.583 --> 23:38.851
Tracy Urteaga said that
a man knocked on her door

23:38.885 --> 23:39.952
claiming
he'd lost his dog.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.087
Next thing she knew,

23:41.120 --> 23:42.555
she woke up in some kind
of container,

23:42.589 --> 23:43.823
water up to her waist.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.492
She managed to escape,
but she couldn't

23:45.525 --> 23:47.193
remember anything about
where she was held.

23:47.226 --> 23:48.160
That sounds like
our trap maker.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.996
What did the investigation
turn up?

23:50.029 --> 23:52.264
Nothing. As far as I can tell,
they closed the case.

23:52.298 --> 23:54.300
The detective said they didn't
have enough to go on.

23:54.333 --> 23:56.202
I think he just
didn't believe her.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.437
Yeah, we should re-interview.
It's hard to remember anything

23:58.471 --> 24:00.006
when people are treating you
like you're crazy.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.176
How did you
escape the tank?

24:04.210 --> 24:06.145
<i>I got lucky.</i>

24:06.178 --> 24:07.880
<i>Couple days later,
there was a power outage,</i>

24:07.914 --> 24:10.683
<i>and the camera went out,
so he couldn't see me.</i>

24:10.717 --> 24:13.252
<i>Took me an hour to open
the door, and then I just ran.</i>

24:13.285 --> 24:15.354
I guess he learned
from that mistake.

24:15.387 --> 24:17.857
Is there anything about the trap
you can remember?

24:17.890 --> 24:19.692
<i>It was in the basement.</i>

24:19.726 --> 24:21.861
<i>When I climbed out,
I fell into his dirty laundry.</i>

24:21.894 --> 24:23.763
<i>I almost threw up.</i>

24:23.796 --> 24:25.264
What do you mean?

24:25.297 --> 24:28.635
<i>The clothes had a rotten smell,
like trash or sewage.</i>

24:28.668 --> 24:30.469
<i>It was coveralls, you know,
like a worker's uniform.</i>

24:30.503 --> 24:32.505
<i>I think they were gray
or green.</i>

24:32.539 --> 24:34.574
Could be a sanitation worker,
water treatment,

24:34.607 --> 24:36.275
road maintenance.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.578
<i>He took someone else,
didn't he?</i>

24:38.611 --> 24:40.479
<i>In Los Angeles.</i>

24:40.513 --> 24:42.014
<i>That's why you're
asking me about this.</i>

24:42.048 --> 24:44.050
Yes.
And we're trying to save her.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.754
Uh, thank you for your time, Tracy.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.289
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
Tell me you found something.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.759
We combed the federal database
looking for similar victims.

24:52.792 --> 24:55.261
A woman's body was found
near Boulder in 2020,

24:55.294 --> 24:57.597
lungs filled with water,
in an empty parking lot.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.766
Another body was found
in Riverside last year,

24:59.799 --> 25:03.002
marked with chemical burns
consistent with potassium amide.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.437
Exactly what kind of sicko
are we dealing with here?

25:05.471 --> 25:09.809
Profile is male, white,
30s to 40s, socially isolated.

25:09.842 --> 25:10.910
I know.
Aren't they all?

25:10.943 --> 25:12.011
Not a lot to go on.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.245
Well, we can be sure
of a moderate

25:13.279 --> 25:14.681
to high degree
of psychopathy--

25:14.714 --> 25:17.483
likely a history of abuse
resulting in aberrant behaviors,

25:17.516 --> 25:19.752
including lack of remorse,
no feelings of guilt,

25:19.786 --> 25:22.488
a need for control,
and predatory behavior.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.657
Killers like this,
they don't stop.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.292
They are stopped.

25:26.325 --> 25:27.960
I got him.
So, I've been running down

25:27.994 --> 25:29.428
purchases of materials
our guy needed

25:29.461 --> 25:30.630
to build this trap, right?

25:30.663 --> 25:32.431
And I found a clerk
in Sun Valley

25:32.464 --> 25:34.634
who remembers selling a water
tank and welding equipment

25:34.667 --> 25:36.202
to a guy with a skin-graft scar
on his arm.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.436
Cameras?

25:37.469 --> 25:39.639
Yep.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.674
Tracy said our guy
wore coveralls,

25:41.708 --> 25:44.010
and everyone who works
for the city has to register

25:44.043 --> 25:46.646
tattoos, marks, and scars
when they start working.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.147
Yeah, most cities
have the same policy.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.248
I'll call to get a warrant,

25:49.281 --> 25:51.217
see if we can get access
to their database,

25:51.250 --> 25:53.485
try to get an ID
to go with the photo.

25:53.519 --> 25:55.154
Great. While you're doing that,
we should head downtown.

25:55.187 --> 25:56.155
Why?

25:56.188 --> 25:57.423
Because I got an address

25:57.456 --> 25:59.091
where all the building materials
were delivered to.

26:10.502 --> 26:12.271
We got a name out
of Denver Sanitation--

26:12.304 --> 26:13.372
Jeffrey Boyle.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.207
He worked there
until November 2020.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.243
Local agents are mobilizing
to hit his last known address,

26:17.276 --> 26:19.245
but it's clear "Jeffrey Boyle"
is an alias.

26:19.278 --> 26:20.847
You guys good
to breach through the back?

26:20.880 --> 26:22.849
Boyle's into booby traps.
We should wait for SWAT.

26:22.882 --> 26:25.217
No, we can't. Bailey is
literally running out of time.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.552
You and your boot
can stay out here if you want,

26:26.585 --> 26:28.254
but we're going in.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.691
Screw that.

26:31.724 --> 26:32.792
We'll go in around back. Go.

26:56.482 --> 26:59.218
Go.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.282
Angela.

28:12.224 --> 28:14.060
Whoa!

28:19.665 --> 28:23.469
Yep.
She's been in there a while.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.411
Police! Stop!

29:04.710 --> 29:06.345
Hands over your head!

29:07.679 --> 29:08.848
Do it now!

29:32.939 --> 29:34.907
Let's go, go!

29:45.918 --> 29:47.954
He came out this way.
Did you see him?

29:47.987 --> 29:49.655
No, we were too busy
bailing out.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.827
We need to call Tim.
I saw the plans.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.695
I know where the generator
is buried.

29:59.731 --> 30:00.632
You alright?
Yeah.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.438
Hello, John.

30:39.471 --> 30:41.840
L.A. traffic really
is the worst, isn't it?

30:41.874 --> 30:44.877
I was afraid our food was gonna
get cold before you got here.

30:44.911 --> 30:48.180
A little on the nose,
even for you, Rosalind--

30:48.214 --> 30:50.382
feeding me a last meal
before you kill me.

30:50.416 --> 30:51.617
Oh, you misunderstood.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.587
The last meal isn't for you.

30:55.621 --> 30:58.457
You're not here
so I can kill you, John.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.592
You're here to murder me.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.373
Are the owners
dead somewhere?

31:14.406 --> 31:16.008
No, it's a rental.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.276
I knew I was going to be here
a while,

31:17.309 --> 31:20.446
and bodies start
to smell fairly quickly.

31:26.785 --> 31:28.054
You need to let her go now.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.222
I know you're in a hurry, John,

31:30.256 --> 31:32.691
but this is <i>my</i> moment,
not yours.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.460
Change for dinner.
There's a suit in the bag.

31:36.728 --> 31:40.399
No. I'm not playing
your little game anymore.

31:40.432 --> 31:43.669
I held up my end of the bargain.
I'm here. Now let her go.

31:44.903 --> 31:48.407
Don't test me.
I will kill you if I have to,

31:48.440 --> 31:52.444
and sit down to watch
Bailey die while I eat filet.

31:52.478 --> 31:55.814
I don't want to do that,
but I'm in control.

31:55.847 --> 31:58.550
There's no bargaining anymore.
There's only compliance.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.119
So put on the damn suit.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.862
I went with a classic
single-breasted.

32:10.896 --> 32:13.499
Inseam might be a little bit
off. I had to eyeball it.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.008
They found the generator
where Harper said it would be.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.309
They're digging it out now.

32:23.342 --> 32:24.776
Great. And when
they cut the power,

32:24.810 --> 32:26.245
those chemicals
are gonna release,

32:26.278 --> 32:29.148
triggering an explosion
and a flash fire.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.217
Well, meaning what?
Don't cut the power?

32:31.250 --> 32:33.152
No, we have to. Otherwise
Bailey floats to the top

32:33.185 --> 32:34.420
and the grate
electrocutes her.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.622
Look, LAFD is standing by
ready to cut the grate

32:36.655 --> 32:38.857
the second the chemical reaction finishes.

32:38.890 --> 32:40.392
Bailey just needs to
hold her breath long enough

32:40.426 --> 32:41.393
to make it through.

32:41.427 --> 32:43.695
She's cold.
She's exhausted.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.597
Everything has to go perfectly
in order for us to save her.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.904
What's really going on here,
Rosalind?

32:52.938 --> 32:54.173
You don't want me
to murder you.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.775
You're way too narcissistic
for suicide.

32:56.808 --> 33:00.379
It's not suicide.
It's legacy.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.650
There's no future for me
on the outside.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.419
I'm too famous.
The world has gotten too small.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.621
I'll get caught, and I'm not
going back to prison.

33:09.655 --> 33:13.792
So that leaves me
with one question.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.461
What is my legacy?

33:15.494 --> 33:17.763
My victims, of course.

33:17.796 --> 33:18.797
My acolytes.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.099
And you.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.771
Why?
I don't understand.

33:25.804 --> 33:29.075
What does the monster
want with a villager?

33:29.108 --> 33:31.810
A middle-aged cop
just trying to live life

33:31.843 --> 33:33.779
with some kind of meaning?

33:33.812 --> 33:36.482
I don't fully understand it myself,

33:36.515 --> 33:38.384
but I find you fascinating.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.386
Even after all the mayhem
I caused,

33:40.419 --> 33:41.987
you quite literally
risked your life

33:42.020 --> 33:44.756
to save mine
the day we met.

33:44.790 --> 33:47.059
And you mourned for Armstrong
after he died,

33:47.093 --> 33:48.060
even though
he betrayed you.

33:48.094 --> 33:51.797
You're just so damn noble.

33:51.830 --> 33:55.567
And what? That makes you want
to remake me in your image?

33:55.601 --> 33:59.705
No.
You could never be me.

33:59.738 --> 34:04.210
I'm a unicorn.
And you're a saint.

34:04.243 --> 34:06.612
But I believe that anyone can be
turned into a murderer,

34:06.645 --> 34:09.348
even a saint.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.883
And I'm betting I found
just the right button

34:11.917 --> 34:14.019
to push to break you.

34:17.289 --> 34:19.391
And how does killing you
save Bailey?

34:19.425 --> 34:22.294
Is there some kind
of shut-off switch here

34:22.328 --> 34:25.197
that once you're dead,
it'll suddenly appear?

34:25.231 --> 34:27.433
No, no, there's no controls
in this house.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.501
I couldn't stop her death
even if I wanted to.

34:29.535 --> 34:31.637
Only Jeffrey can.
He's watching us right now.

34:34.506 --> 34:37.943
Once he sees you murder me
in cold blood,

34:37.976 --> 34:41.447
then he will unlock the trap
and release Bailey.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.081
And you expect me
to believe

34:43.115 --> 34:46.017
he's a serial killer
of his word?

34:46.051 --> 34:48.019
He is, actually.

34:48.053 --> 34:50.021
He was very excited
when I pitched him the idea.

34:50.055 --> 34:51.457
He loved
the artistry of it.

34:51.490 --> 34:54.393
And between you and me,
I think he wants my crown.

34:59.665 --> 35:01.500
It's time.

35:05.537 --> 35:06.872
I'm ready.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.826
Um, excuse me. Bailey.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.628
Okay. They're about
to take out the generator,

35:29.661 --> 35:31.263
so once
the chemicals fall--

35:31.297 --> 35:32.498
I won't be able to surface.

35:32.531 --> 35:36.568
I know.
Okay, here we go.

35:36.602 --> 35:37.636
I'll see you
on the other side.

35:44.443 --> 35:45.777
Cut the power now.

36:01.059 --> 36:02.561
She's dying, John.

36:04.496 --> 36:05.831
Kill me.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.967
I can't just shoot you.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.502
Then she dies,

36:10.536 --> 36:12.170
and you drove all this way
for nothing,

36:12.204 --> 36:14.506
and it will haunt you
for the rest of your life.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.141
Because if you'd just
stayed with her,

36:16.174 --> 36:18.244
you might have figured out
a way to save her--

36:18.277 --> 36:20.979
used your everyman,
blue-collar skills

36:21.012 --> 36:24.216
to deconstruct
what Jeffrey built, hmm?

36:24.250 --> 36:27.953
But you let me push you
to leave her behind,

36:27.986 --> 36:33.024
to come here to confront me
because you need to be the hero.

36:33.058 --> 36:36.295
The better man.
The martyr.

36:36.328 --> 36:41.032
In the same way that I am driven
to pay at slaughter.

36:41.066 --> 36:44.470
So be the hero, John.

36:44.503 --> 36:48.106
Sacrifice your morality
to save her.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.272
Take the shot.

37:20.306 --> 37:22.974
Then Jeffrey empties the tank.
You can still save her.

37:26.878 --> 37:28.246
Bailey!

37:28.280 --> 37:29.080
Get in there.

37:44.530 --> 37:45.431
Damn it.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.170
She loves you.

37:52.203 --> 37:54.773
She thinks
you're going to save her.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.642
So come on, John.
Do it.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.229
I'm a killer.
She's a hero.

38:18.263 --> 38:20.999
You couldn't possibly choose
my life over hers,

38:21.032 --> 38:23.602
so take the shot.

38:23.635 --> 38:24.870
Kill me.

38:46.892 --> 38:48.394
I can't.

38:52.398 --> 38:56.234
Oh, John.

38:56.267 --> 38:57.869
What have you done?

39:02.674 --> 39:04.042
We're through.

39:32.471 --> 39:33.672
Come on!

39:35.474 --> 39:37.008
Bailey!

39:37.042 --> 39:38.577
Come on.

39:40.646 --> 39:42.080
Oh, come on.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.487
Okay.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.790
Oh, my God.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.091
How long was that?

39:53.124 --> 39:54.760
Uh...

39:54.793 --> 39:56.762
4 minutes
and 20 seconds.

39:56.795 --> 39:58.830
New record.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.003
Where's John?

40:10.842 --> 40:13.178
Yes.
This is Officer John Nolan.

40:13.211 --> 40:15.246
I have Rosalind Dyer
in custody.
