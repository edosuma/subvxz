You know, 7-pound, 3-ounce

05:10.440 --> 05:12.602
No big deal.
Look at him, trying to be humble.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.450
He saved the mother's life.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.130

05:16.280 --> 05:18.203
Impressive.
So tell your friend.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.169
Mm-mm. She don't like cops.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.169
What kind of person
doesn't date a cop?

05:22.360 --> 05:26.604
We're brave, honest, I got a great body.
Oh, God.

05:26.800 --> 05:30.202
Well, I like cops. I'll date you.
She knows what I'm talking about.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.290
Okay, while y'all talk about that,
I'm gonna take a break.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.166

05:36.320 --> 05:38.209
One of these times
I'm gonna get it.

Ten minutes away?
We can make it there in five.

06:09.720 --> 06:14.044
I accept the invitation
only if I get to make the coffee this time.

06:14.240 --> 06:17.050
Okay. But I don't like
my coffee too strong.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.208
I don't like mine see-through,
so...

06:19.960 --> 06:21.325
So do we got a problem?

Shut it.
Please don't hurt me.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.809
You Okay?

16:02.440 --> 16:05.125
Jor, now, why you
beating yourself up over this?

16:05.360 --> 16:07.966
You've had bad calls before, Jor.

16:08.480 --> 16:12.565
My daddy told me the hardest
part about being a cop

16:12.760 --> 16:16.321
was knowing you might be
the difference

16:16.520 --> 16:21.003
between somebody living
and somebody dying.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.931
And when you couldn't
shoulder that,

16:25.520 --> 16:28.091
then it's time for you to get out.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.365
So that's what you're gonna do?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.889
I'll be here when you need me.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.161
You know that, right?

17:02.040 --> 17:03.680
<i>911, where's your emergency?</i>

17:03.760 --> 17:05.569
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

17:05.720 --> 17:07.449
<i>Daddy, stop them all!</i>

17:32.760 --> 17:34.524
- All right, bye.
- What was that about?

17:34.720 --> 17:37.530
She's just...
"Casey can do a great grown-up voice."

17:37.680 --> 17:39.284
And you're like, "She's awesome."

17:39.480 --> 17:41.528
She, like, can't lie to her mom. Yeah.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.122
No, that's... That's...
That's stupid. Bye.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.761
Ugh. Let's eat.
I'm starving like a motherfucker.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.928
Oh, my God, you are so foul,
Autumn.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.884
Hey, call me a bitch.
What?

17:53.040 --> 17:54.530
I wanna hear you say it.
No.

17:54.760 --> 17:57.240
Just say... Just say "bitch."
I wanna hear you say it.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.771
No.
You can't do it.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.691
No, I can, it's just you're not.
You're a jerk.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.930
Oh, are you kidding me?

18:06.120 --> 18:08.441
Raul thought that we
should have one just for us.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.802
He bought that to keep tabs on you.
He didn't.

18:10.960 --> 18:15.284
My parents keep checking their bill.
TracFones are prepaid. Under the radar.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.606
Ugh. He's so high-maintenance.
Hey, lover.

18:20.040 --> 18:24.807
No, we're shopping. What do you think?
I was gonna call you in two minutes.

18:25.680 --> 18:29.401
You wanna do what to me?
Oh, you're disgusting.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.011
Is that even legal?

19:02.040 --> 19:04.168
So first you're gonna notice patterns.

19:04.320 --> 19:07.403
Behavioral changes
in very predictable ways.

19:07.600 --> 19:12.003
Rising temperatures means rising
tempers, so we get the violent calls.

19:12.200 --> 19:16.125
Rainy days and Christmas, it's gloomy
outside, sometimes people are alone,

19:16.320 --> 19:18.288
that's when we get the suicides.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.288
Now, Saturday mornings are generally
very slow and calm times,

19:23.480 --> 19:25.847
and I think that's because
people are at home

19:26.040 --> 19:29.647
probably recovering from Friday night.
Why? What happens Friday night?

19:31.600 --> 19:34.365
All hell breaks loose.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.362
<i>Half your calls are gonna be
non-emergencies.</i>

19:37.560 --> 19:41.610
Half of those, that's gonna be someone
asking for directions to Starbucks

19:41.760 --> 19:43.000
or how to baste a turkey.

19:44.760 --> 19:48.401
Go ahead, laugh at that, that's good.
That's gonna prepare you for real stuff.

19:48.560 --> 19:52.087
The jumpers, the home invasions,
the triple homicides, the gang-banging...

19:52.280 --> 19:53.520
You've seen the quiet room.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.126
That's where we go
to decompress after a bad call.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.051
But if you need anything more than
a nap and some Muzak,

19:59.240 --> 20:00.924
then you have to call our BSS.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.963
That's behavioral science specialist.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.731
His name is Dr. Keating,
he's on call two-four-seven

20:05.920 --> 20:09.003
any time any of you need to talk.
Talk about what?

20:09.920 --> 20:11.763
What's your name again?
Josh.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.530
Okay, listen, Josh.

20:13.720 --> 20:16.564
The most important thing to
remember about this job is this:

20:16.760 --> 20:19.081
Stay emotionally detached.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.448
Don't get too involved
in your P.R.'s crisis.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.130
What's P.R.?
Person reporting.

20:23.360 --> 20:28.685
Right. And never ever make promises
because you can't keep them.

20:28.840 --> 20:31.810
Okay? Now follow me to the call floor.

20:32.840 --> 20:37.448
If you're wondering why security's so
tight, we're the ears and eyes of the city.

20:37.600 --> 20:41.002
We're the link between every
human crisis and every first responder.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.009
That's the Fire and Police Department.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.966
If the Hive goes down,
this whole city goes dark.

20:47.160 --> 20:51.404
Question here.
Why do they call it the Hive?

20:51.640 --> 20:55.361
Listen. Hear all those
little worker bees?

20:59.120 --> 21:01.851
Hey, what about Max?
You know he wants to bone you, right?

21:02.040 --> 21:04.247
Oh, my God, Autumn.
Stop it, that's disgusting.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.363
No, he doesn't.
Oh, he does.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.722
No, he smokes too much dope.

21:08.920 --> 21:09.967
Dope?
Yeah.

21:10.200 --> 21:13.568
Oh, my God, you're so cute. I'm not
telling you to make him your trainer.

21:13.720 --> 21:17.964
Just come out with us Saturday night.
No. I don't like it when you set me up.

21:18.160 --> 21:21.801
All right. Just trying to help you
since you never seem to help yourself.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.050
I can help myself. You're not, like, my matchmaker.
I don't need you to be my mom here.

21:28.680 --> 21:32.082
Oh, shit. I was supposed to pick
my brother up like 20 minutes ago.

21:32.280 --> 21:35.250
What? No, you can't, you can't
leave now. I'm not even done yet.

21:35.480 --> 21:38.529
Sorry.
Come on, you suck.

21:40.280 --> 21:43.682
That was really good.
Call me later, okay?

21:46.280 --> 21:48.601
Hey, I'm leaving the mall right now.

22:10.360 --> 22:11.486
Idiot.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.531
Why can't you just text me
like every other morn?

22:24.720 --> 22:28.520
Yes, I know, I'm sorry, Mom,
but really, come on.

22:28.720 --> 22:32.281
Yeah, I'm on my way home now.
I'll be home soon.

22:32.480 --> 22:35.131
Okay. Love you too. Bye.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.001
Whoa!

22:39.160 --> 22:41.162
Oh, my God.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.165
Jeez, I'm sorry.
Dude.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.011
You didn't look before you backed up?
I didn't see you.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.241
All right, whatever.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.131
Oh, awesome, it's broken.
Perfect. Oh!

23:05.880 --> 23:08.360
This here is Brooke.
She's a probie.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.325
She was exactly where
you guys are six months ago.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.010
How you liking the job, Brooke?

23:13.240 --> 23:15.846
It's definitely the hardest job
I've ever had.

23:16.080 --> 23:19.402
- What's the hardest part?
- I guess the not knowing.

23:20.040 --> 23:23.044
A lot of times
you don't know how it ends.

23:23.240 --> 23:27.802
When units get to a scene, you sign off.
And they take over but you don't know.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.083
I mean, did they make an arrest?
Shoot the bad guy?

23:31.280 --> 23:34.727
Did the P.R. live? Did she die?
You'll get used to it.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.927
911, where's your emergency?

23:40.320 --> 23:42.721
Right here's where the P.R.'s
phone number comes up.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.922
And the cell's GPS chip allows us

23:45.120 --> 23:48.010
to get an exact lat-long coordinate
right here on this map.

23:48.200 --> 23:52.046
Then over here, she can dispatch
the police to the scene at any time.

23:52.280 --> 23:55.568
- Okay? Any questions?
- Yeah.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.091
What about you, Ms. Turner?

23:58.320 --> 23:59.367
What about me?

23:59.560 --> 24:01.688
How come you're not out here
on the floor?

24:03.720 --> 24:05.768
Because I'm the teacher.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.082
Now, why don't you guys
follow me this way?

24:08.280 --> 24:10.123
I'm gonna get you set up
for some calls.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.761
Oh, my God.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.247
No.

24:49.440 --> 24:50.521
No, no.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.410
No, no. No!

24:58.640 --> 25:00.768
No! No! No!

25:09.760 --> 25:11.205
No, no.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.770
No.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.560
So I think you guys had a good first day.
Things are gonna get a little bit harder.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.691
911, where is your emergency?

25:40.920 --> 25:44.163
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay, slow down, slow down.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.209
Where are you?

25:47.800 --> 25:51.168
Okay, where...?
I can't understand you.

25:51.400 --> 25:54.643
What...? What mall?
What mall...? What mall are you at?

25:56.640 --> 25:58.847
Okay, w...
No, where did he hit you?

25:59.040 --> 26:02.089
<i>He didn't hit me. He
almost hit me and then I...</i>

26:02.240 --> 26:05.642
Okay, where... Where is the vehicle?
<i>I don't know where the vehicle is!</i>

26:05.840 --> 26:08.446
<i>I'm in the trunk.
I'm, like, in the trunk!</i>

26:08.640 --> 26:11.484
Jordan. There's no location.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.603
It's a disposable. No chip.
Ask her name.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.524
What is your name?
What is your name?

26:15.680 --> 26:17.011
Casey. Casey.

26:17.200 --> 26:22.001
Casey. Okay, Casey, calm down, okay?
<i>I'm in the trunk on my friend's phone.</i>

26:22.200 --> 26:24.680
- Why can't you just trace it?
<i>- We're gonna try.</i>

26:24.880 --> 26:28.282
You're on a disposable phone,
so it might take us a little while.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.171
What? You can't find me?

26:31.360 --> 26:33.442
I just need you...
You can't find me?

26:33.640 --> 26:36.484
<i>No, no, you have to find me!</i>
No. We will.

26:36.640 --> 26:40.929
<i>You have to find me, please!
Please! Please, I don't...</i>

26:41.160 --> 26:43.162
I don't wanna die.

26:43.360 --> 26:47.490
Jordan. I don't know what to do.
She's freaking out.

26:47.680 --> 26:50.001
What do I say?
<i>Please, you have to find me.</i>

26:50.200 --> 26:52.885
I don't wanna die.
I don't know. What do I do?

26:53.080 --> 26:57.290
<i>Please, you have to help me.
You have to help me, this is like...</i>

26:57.480 --> 27:00.563
<i>He's driving. Nobody's ever
come out of anything like this.</i>

27:00.800 --> 27:04.771
Hi. Casey. My name is Jordan.
Okay?

27:04.960 --> 27:07.930
I'm here to help you, okay?
I was talking to another girl.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.889
Can you put me on with her?
I'm here.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.526
I'm gonna help you, okay?
Please, help me.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.883
Casey, listen to me, sweetheart.
Okay, we are gonna...

27:16.080 --> 27:17.730
<i>Please, I don't wanna die.</i>

27:17.920 --> 27:19.524
Casey, you're not gonna die.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.646
Breathe.

27:33.640 --> 27:37.964
You've got it.
Okay.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.530
Okay.
<i>I don't wanna die.</i>

27:40.760 --> 27:42.524
Casey?
What?

27:42.760 --> 27:44.603
<i>We are gonna find you,
okay, honey?</i>

27:44.800 --> 27:49.647
You promise?
Do you promise you're gonna find me?

27:52.360 --> 27:55.011
I can promise you this,
sweetheart, okay?

27:55.200 --> 27:59.330
You've got the best team of people
in this whole city working to find you.

27:59.520 --> 28:04.208
<i>But in order for us to help you,
I need you to help me.</i>

28:04.800 --> 28:06.928
Now, can you do that, sweetheart?

28:07.160 --> 28:11.768
<i>Can you do that?</i>
Okay. Okay.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.207
Okay. Good girl, good girl.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.643
Now, Casey, first thing I need you to do
is look inside that trunk

28:17.880 --> 28:20.042
and see if you
can find a release lever.

28:20.240 --> 28:24.086
Call the carrier, have them fax us
the E.C. forms so we can start the trace.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.730
- Get rid of these kids.
- Okay.

28:25.920 --> 28:28.730
<i>Usually it glows in the dark.
Do you see that?</i>

28:28.920 --> 28:31.366
No, no, it doesn't even have
one of those.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.126
Okay. Okay, it's okay, sweetheart.

28:34.320 --> 28:36.766
What mall were you at
when you were abducted?

28:36.920 --> 28:39.048
Fashion Plaza.
Fashion Plaza.

28:39.240 --> 28:41.891
Okay. Oh, I know that one,
that's downtown, right?

28:43.560 --> 28:44.925
It's okay, sweetheart.
Calm down.

28:45.160 --> 28:46.889
<i>What's your last name?</i>
Welson.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.088
Welson, okay.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.408
Oh, my God.
Okay, I see that.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.046
I got all your information
right here in front of me.

28:54.200 --> 28:58.762
My mom's gonna be freaking out.
Oh, look, you're a Capricorn. Me too.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.923
You know what that means, honey?
What?

29:01.120 --> 29:04.090
We're fighters.
That means we were born to fight.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.844
So you know what I want you to do?

29:06.040 --> 29:08.486
<i>I want you to fight. Okay?</i>

29:08.720 --> 29:11.041
Can you fight for me, Casey?
Yeah.

29:11.240 --> 29:12.730
<i>Okay. Good girl.</i>

29:12.920 --> 29:14.843
Can you describe
the man who grabbed you?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.162
Was he black, white, Asian, Hispanic?
<i>White.</i>

29:17.320 --> 29:18.367
<i>White, okay.</i>

29:18.520 --> 29:20.887
I think. Dressed normal.
<i>What does normal mean?</i>

29:21.040 --> 29:23.771
<i>Did he have on a hat? Jeans?</i>
I don't... Sunglasses.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.327
He was wearing sunglasses.
Sunglasses, okay.

29:26.520 --> 29:29.126
Can you guess his age?
Twenties, 30s, 40s?

29:29.320 --> 29:32.290
Thirties, I think. Like mid-SOS.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.403
Thirties, okay, good girl. Okay, great.

29:34.600 --> 29:38.764
Honey, what color is the car?
I think it was like red or maroon.

29:38.960 --> 29:41.042
<i>Okay, did it have two doors or four?</i>

29:41.200 --> 29:43.123
<i>I think it had four. Four.</i>
Four, okay.

29:43.320 --> 29:44.970
Hang in there. You're doing great.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.128
<i>Any available units. Kidnap in progress.</i>

29:47.280 --> 29:49.203
<i>Female abducted
at Fashion Plaza Mall.</i>

29:49.360 --> 29:51.601
<i>450 Holloway,
approximately 15 minutes ago.</i>

29:51.800 --> 29:54.644
White male, 30s, in a four-door maroon,
unknown make, model.

29:54.840 --> 29:57.047
<i>P. R.'s in the trunk
on a disposable phone.</i>

29:57.240 --> 29:58.890
Is that Jordan?

29:59.040 --> 30:01.407
...But not enough to triangulate.
P.C.C.'s pinging.

30:01.600 --> 30:05.082
Any available unit, code three.
8-Adam-16 en route, code three.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.727
It's good to hear
your voice again, Jordan.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.961
Okay, Casey, can you tell if you're on
a freeway or if you're on surface streets?

30:14.920 --> 30:17.002
- Oh, no.
<i>- What?</i>

30:17.200 --> 30:18.804
Somebody's calling.
He's gonna hear.

30:19.040 --> 30:22.169
No, don't answer it.
God, no, it's Raul.

30:22.360 --> 30:24.010
Do not break contact with me.

30:24.200 --> 30:25.850
<i>Casey, stay on the line.</i>

30:26.040 --> 30:28.884
I can't lose you. Stay on the line.
This can't be happening.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.725
Can you tell me if those wheels
are going fast or slow?

30:31.920 --> 30:33.331
It's like... It's like even.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.960
Does it sound like a freeway
or surface streets?

30:36.160 --> 30:39.323
We might be on a freeway.
Okay, good girl, good girl.

30:39.560 --> 30:43.690
All available units, P.R. believes vehicle
is on the freeway, direction unknown.

30:59.840 --> 31:04.289
<i>Casey, sweetheart, does the trunk smell
like it's a new trunk or an old one?</i>

31:04.480 --> 31:07.211
It kind of smells like old.
<i>Okay, good.</i>

31:07.400 --> 31:10.324
Yeah, there's, like, work stuff.
Okay, honey.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.091
Can you see the tail lights?
What?

31:13.280 --> 31:15.567
In older cars there may be
access to tail lights.

31:15.760 --> 31:17.125
Look for the red glow, okay?

31:17.320 --> 31:19.004
Yeah, yeah, I see it.
<i>Great.</i>

31:19.200 --> 31:20.247
<i>I found it. Yeah, yeah.</i>

31:20.480 --> 31:23.450
Is there any way you can kick that light?
Can you do that?

31:23.640 --> 31:25.165
No, no, he's gonna hear, Jordan.

31:25.400 --> 31:28.643
No, honey, we gotta try, honey.
We gotta try to get you out of there.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.763
<i>I'll try.</i>
Come on, you can do it.

31:30.960 --> 31:34.203
The carrier got our request.
I'm just waiting for them to call back.

31:34.400 --> 31:35.447
We can't wait, Maddy.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.210
You know how those prepaids work.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.886
The call could be within
a five-mile radius.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.202
You just keep doing what you're doing.
Okay.

31:42.360 --> 31:44.727
Casey. How you doing, sweetheart?
Not coming out.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.644
<i>Casey, try the other light.</i>

31:46.880 --> 31:49.008
Okay.
You can do it. Fast as you can, honey.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.161
<i>New music alternative.</i>

32:28.880 --> 32:31.929
I did it. Jordan, I did it. I got it out.
You did it. Good work.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.241
Good work, Casey.

32:33.440 --> 32:36.011
<i>Now look out the hole
and tell me what you see.</i>

32:36.200 --> 32:37.531
It's a freeway.

32:37.760 --> 32:40.286
Okay. Okay, honey,
here's what I need you to do, okay?

32:40.520 --> 32:44.127
I need you to stick your arm out
and wave it, wave it, wave it.

32:44.320 --> 32:47.688
Okay, here is the plan. I wanna see
if any other car's gonna notice.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.201
Okay.
<i>Let me know when you've done it, okay?</i>

32:54.920 --> 32:57.241
I'm waving.
Good girl, good girl.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.807
I got a P.R. waving her arm
out of a trunk of a car!

33:00.040 --> 33:01.326
Let's see if we get a call.

33:13.520 --> 33:14.885
911, where's your emergency?

33:15.080 --> 33:18.368
Hi. Someone's stuck in the
trunk of the car in front of me.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.170
A red Camry. It may be a child.

33:20.600 --> 33:23.763
Yo, I got her!
Okay, ma'am, what road are you on?

33:23.960 --> 33:25.610
The 170, heading north.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.962
Can you tell me
the license number on that car?

33:28.160 --> 33:32.051
Can you do that?
It's 7CFI06X.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.203
Casey, we're real close, honey.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.725
Is it a stolen vehicle?
No, no.

33:41.920 --> 33:45.402
Registration's for this white Ford
Explorer, so he switched plates.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.841
- Switched plates.
- Hold on. I'm coming up to him.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.048
I'll get a description.
No, no, no. Wait.

33:50.240 --> 33:54.245
<i>Ma 'am, do not approach the vehicle.
This driver is suspected in a kidnapping.</i>

33:54.400 --> 33:58.405
<i>Okay? Do not approach the vehicle.</i>
He's getting off.

33:59.520 --> 34:01.443
- What exit?
- Fernando Boulevard.

34:01.680 --> 34:05.810
All units, Camry spotted exiting the
170 northbound on Fernando Boulevard.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.606
Northbound. Shit.
About face. Hold on.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.928
<i>Be advised he's using stolen plates.</i>

34:11.120 --> 34:14.806
Number seven, Charlie,
India, zero, six, X-ray.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.241
Look out of that hole
and tell me what you see.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.966
<i>Do you see any landmarks?
Street names, anything?</i>

34:21.159 --> 34:23.003
No, it all looks exactly the same.

34:23.199 --> 34:26.443
Okay, it all looks the same.
Okay. Okay.

34:26.639 --> 34:29.166
- Okay, sweetheart, sweetheart.
<i>- What's happening?</i>

34:29.320 --> 34:32.244
Casey, you told me
there was stuff in the trunk, right?

34:32.440 --> 34:35.444
Describe what you see, Casey.
Gotta be something that can help.

34:35.639 --> 34:37.324
<i>Okay, look around.</i>
Okay.

34:38.280 --> 34:40.442
<i>What do you see?</i>
A bottle of bleach.

34:40.639 --> 34:43.291
Some paint and a screwdriver.
<i>A screwdriver, okay.</i>

34:43.480 --> 34:45.527
A paintbrush, a...

34:45.719 --> 34:47.722
<i>What else?</i>
And a hoe.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.967
<i>Okay. What else?</i>

34:51.040 --> 34:53.246
Oh, my God, no.

34:54.320 --> 34:55.367
<i>No.</i>
What is it?

34:55.520 --> 34:57.488
<i>My God. Oh, my God.</i>

34:58.440 --> 35:00.442
He's gonna bury me.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.401
Casey, what is it, honey?
What is it?

35:03.600 --> 35:05.841
There's a shovel,
he's gonna bury me.

35:06.080 --> 35:08.560
<i>He's gonna kill me
and then he's gonna bury me.</i>

35:08.760 --> 35:09.841
No, honey. Casey.

35:10.080 --> 35:13.721
Casey, I need you to focus. Come on,
sweetie, pull it together. Come on.

35:13.960 --> 35:17.521
No, I know he's gonna do this.
Get me out of here now.

35:17.760 --> 35:21.367
What's your favorite movie?
Casey, what's your favorite movie?

35:21.520 --> 35:22.806
What's your favorite movie?

35:24.600 --> 35:26.728
What?
<i>What's your favorite movie?</i>

35:26.920 --> 35:29.526
Just tell me, what...?
Tell me, what is it?

35:33.480 --> 35:34.686
<i>Bridesmaids.</i>

35:34.880 --> 35:36.848
Are you kidding me?
I love that movie.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.963
I think I saw it
about a hundred times.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.640
Okay, so you know what?
Let's make a deal, okay?

35:41.840 --> 35:46.243
You and me, we'll go to the movies and
I'm gonna buy you anything you want.

35:46.600 --> 35:49.171
Okay? You and me.

35:50.640 --> 35:53.325
Okay.
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

35:53.520 --> 35:57.081
Now, what I need you to do
is to take one of those paint cans,

35:57.280 --> 35:59.965
and I need you to open it. Okay?

36:11.520 --> 36:14.888
Okay. Okay, okay, I got it.
Okay, you got it open. Good girl.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.809
So pour that paint out of that hole.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.482
<i>Any available
units, kidnap in progress.</i>

36:31.640 --> 36:35.247
<i>Suspect is white male, 30s, in a
four-door maroon, unknown make, model.</i>

36:35.440 --> 36:37.841
<i>P.R. is in the trunk.
P. R. is leaving a trail</i>

36:38.000 --> 36:39.968
<i>of white paint coming from the trunk.</i>

36:40.160 --> 36:43.687
<i>I repeat, look for white paint along
northbound Fernando Boulevard.</i>

36:45.640 --> 36:46.926
The paint's almost gone.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.963
<i>Open another can of paint, okay?</i>

36:49.120 --> 36:50.690
Okay, please stay on the line.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.888
Yeah, I'm right here, honey,
I'm right here.

37:08.880 --> 37:12.885
Hey. Hey.

37:21.360 --> 37:22.441
Hey, how you doing?

37:22.640 --> 37:24.927
Man, you got paint
coming out of your trunk.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.129
Yeah. There.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.242
Ah. Yeah, thanks.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.245
All right.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.967
Oh, no, Jordan! Jordan...

38:16.120 --> 38:19.567
Casey?
No, no, no.

38:19.760 --> 38:23.526
Casey?
Jordan.

38:25.440 --> 38:28.762
Jordan! Jordan, can you hear me?
Casey, what's happening, honey?

38:33.520 --> 38:35.124
<i>Casey?</i>

38:44.880 --> 38:46.644
<i>Casey, I need you to say something.</i>

38:48.600 --> 38:51.285
Casey, I need you
to talk to me, sweetheart.

38:53.920 --> 38:55.570
Casey.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.290
<i>I need you to say something to me.</i>

38:57.760 --> 38:59.603
<i>Casey.</i>
No, no, no! Please!

38:59.800 --> 39:01.609
- Please. Don't do any...
- No.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.404
No, no, no!
Shut up!

39:04.040 --> 39:06.008
<i>- Aah! Aah!</i>
<i>- Shut up!</i>

39:06.160 --> 39:08.925
I said shut up
or I'm gonna kill you right here.

39:15.080 --> 39:17.731
Look at what you did.

39:27.520 --> 39:28.851
Adam-16, what you got?

39:29.040 --> 39:33.887
Air 18, this is 14267.
We aren't locating any paint trails. Over.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.049
No, no, no. No, please, don't.

39:39.680 --> 39:42.650
Don't you cry.
No, no. Please don't...

39:42.840 --> 39:45.002
Hey, you okay there, buddy?

39:47.640 --> 39:50.769
Yeah. Some, uh...

39:51.600 --> 39:54.410
Some paint cans spilled is all.

39:54.600 --> 39:57.922
Yeah, because I saw the broken light
and the paint, and I don't know,

39:58.160 --> 40:00.401
I just thought it looked weird.
You know?

40:00.600 --> 40:03.649
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Real mess back here.

40:03.880 --> 40:04.927
I bet.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.011
Real mess back here.

40:08.160 --> 40:09.764
Yeah.

40:10.880 --> 40:13.360
Yeah, well, thanks for alerting me.

40:13.840 --> 40:16.491
Yeah, yeah, sure, no worries, man.

40:22.040 --> 40:23.246
All right, man.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.485
Take care.

40:57.920 --> 40:58.967
<i>911...</i>

41:24.960 --> 41:26.564
Fuck!

41:56.600 --> 41:58.807
Look what you made me do!

41:59.000 --> 42:02.925
He's dead because of you!

42:21.720 --> 42:23.563
Oh, my God. No, no, no!

42:24.560 --> 42:26.847
<i>Shut up.</i>
Maddy, trace. We need the trace.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.082
I got a ping on a tower
on Fernando Boulevard.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.089
- We know that already.
<i>- Shut up.</i>

42:31.240 --> 42:34.562
<i>Please, don't do this, please.</i>

42:36.240 --> 42:37.605
<i>Please.</i>

42:42.840 --> 42:45.844
<i>This is Air 18, responding
to that assault off the 170.</i>

42:46.080 --> 42:48.560
<i>Looks like we've got that red Camry
in a Metro/ink lot.</i>

42:48.720 --> 42:51.246
<i>Repeat, we're code six on the Camry.</i>

43:11.120 --> 43:13.202
Shit.
Get an SID unit here now.

43:13.920 --> 43:17.925
<i>8-Adam-16, what you got?</i>
They're GOA.

43:18.520 --> 43:20.682
<i>There's a lot of broken glass.</i>

43:25.080 --> 43:26.764
And there's a lot of blood.

44:06.640 --> 44:08.608
Jordan?
Casey.

44:08.800 --> 44:11.849
Casey, I'm right here, baby.
What happened, honey? Are you hurt?

44:12.400 --> 44:14.767
No, we switched cars.
He switched what?

44:15.000 --> 44:17.241
<i>We switched cars.</i>
He switched cars.

44:17.440 --> 44:20.728
This guy tried to help
and then he got hit over the head,

44:20.920 --> 44:23.207
and then he threw him
in the back of the trunk.

44:23.400 --> 44:25.687
There's a guy in the car?
<i>In the trunk with me.</i>

44:25.840 --> 44:28.969
He threw the shovel in here
and said he was gonna bury me.

44:29.160 --> 44:31.606
Casey, how hurt is he?

44:31.800 --> 44:35.168
<i>How hurt is the man?</i>
He's dead.

44:35.400 --> 44:36.890
<i>He's gonna bury me, Jordan.</i>

44:37.080 --> 44:39.162
Okay, Casey.
<i>There's a shovel with me.</i>

44:39.400 --> 44:42.529
I need you to describe
that car you're in, okay?

44:43.080 --> 44:44.445
It's black. Um...

44:44.640 --> 44:45.687
Okay.
<i>Black.</i>

44:45.880 --> 44:48.929
What about the tail lights in this car?
Can you kick them out?

44:49.120 --> 44:52.363
No, there's, like,
this metal frame over the...

44:56.640 --> 44:58.529
Shh! No! Shh!
Aah! Aah!

44:58.680 --> 45:00.045
Casey, what's happening?

45:00.240 --> 45:02.481
Shut up, please. No, please.

45:09.040 --> 45:11.771
You have to be quiet, please. Stop.
Help!

45:11.960 --> 45:14.201
Let me out of here!
Please stop. Please!

45:14.360 --> 45:18.763
Let me out of here!
You just have to shut up!

45:21.400 --> 45:23.721
Shh!
Hello! Aah!

45:26.800 --> 45:28.529
Please stop. Shut up, shut up.

45:28.720 --> 45:31.087
Shut up. He can hear you,
he can hear you.

45:31.280 --> 45:32.691
Stop, he's gonna kill you.

45:59.280 --> 46:01.886
Oh, no, no, no.

46:05.040 --> 46:06.690
<i>Please, no!</i>

46:07.800 --> 46:09.404
Last warning.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.090
No, please.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.002
<i>Last warning.</i>

46:20.720 --> 46:21.926
No.

46:22.120 --> 46:24.248
I want this whole place covered.

46:25.040 --> 46:27.691
So how we looking? Anything?
Partials.

46:27.880 --> 46:30.804
Partials. You're telling me
you can't find one solid print?

46:31.000 --> 46:33.731
Well, I don't know what to say.
He's smart. He wiped it.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.528
He wasn't that smart.

46:49.720 --> 46:51.768
Agent, I want this glass printed.

47:07.280 --> 47:09.851
They issued an AMBER Alert.
We need the trace.

47:10.040 --> 47:12.122
- Just keep her on the line.
<i>- Jordan.</i>

47:12.320 --> 47:15.563
Casey. Casey, what's happening,
honey? What's happening?

47:15.760 --> 47:17.410
He killed him.

47:18.360 --> 47:22.206
<i>He started screaming and
I tried to stop him, but he wouldn't,</i>

47:22.440 --> 47:25.842
and then he just...
He just killed him. It's all my fault.

47:26.040 --> 47:29.886
<i>There's a lot of people here counting on you.
Help us figure this out.</i>

47:30.080 --> 47:31.320
It's all my fault.

47:31.520 --> 47:35.161
No, it's not your fault.
It's not your fault, okay, sweetheart?

47:35.640 --> 47:38.246
<i>Don't blame yourself.
Listen to me.</i>

47:38.440 --> 47:40.602
Sometimes,

47:40.800 --> 47:44.850
we all get ourselves in situations
that sometimes get out of our control.

47:45.040 --> 47:50.171
And bad things can happen, but it doesn't
mean that that's your fault, okay?

47:51.080 --> 47:53.765
Jordan?
I'm here, I'm here.

47:54.360 --> 47:56.681
<i>Do you record these calls?</i>

47:57.760 --> 47:59.250
Yes, we do, why?

47:59.480 --> 48:05.169
Well, because I just wanna leave my
family a message real quick. if I could.

48:05.400 --> 48:08.290
No, no, you don't have to do that,
baby, we're gonna find you.

48:08.480 --> 48:11.643
It'll just take a second. Just please.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.284
<i>Mom.</i>

48:16.360 --> 48:19.921
Mom, you were always
the perfect mother.

48:20.160 --> 48:23.642
You gave me everything
that I ever wanted.

48:25.480 --> 48:27.960
And I love you.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.402
<i>I love you so much.</i>

48:31.600 --> 48:36.606
Casey, I promise you
you're gonna see your mother again.

48:36.800 --> 48:39.201
<i>And I'm really sorry.</i>

48:41.400 --> 48:44.244
Please don't ever forget me.

48:48.600 --> 48:49.886
That's all.

48:50.080 --> 48:52.560
<i>That's all I wanted to say.</i>

48:53.440 --> 48:54.771
Okay.

48:54.960 --> 48:58.123
Okay, okay. Okay, sweetheart.

48:59.920 --> 49:01.729
Casey.

49:02.840 --> 49:05.889
You remember you told me
you were a fighter?

49:06.600 --> 49:11.208
<i>Yes, we're fighters. We're Capricorns
and we're fighters, remember?</i>

49:11.800 --> 49:15.521
Okay, so you know what we're gonna do
right now? We're gonna fight.

49:15.760 --> 49:18.161
You and me, we're gonna fight, okay?

49:18.680 --> 49:20.648
<i>We're gonna fight.</i>

49:20.840 --> 49:22.683
Okay.
<i>Okay, good girl.</i>

49:23.520 --> 49:28.128
Now, what I need you to do is go in
that man's pockets and get his wallet.

49:28.600 --> 49:29.886
No. No.

49:30.080 --> 49:33.323
I need you to get his wallet
and tell me what his name is, Casey.

49:33.520 --> 49:34.965
<i>I need to know who that man is.</i>

49:35.120 --> 49:38.488
<i>In order for me to find you,
I have to know who this man is.</i>

49:38.920 --> 49:42.163
I need to know his name
as fast as you can, sweetheart.

49:42.360 --> 49:45.330
<i>Come on, honey, do it. You can do it.</i>

49:49.880 --> 49:51.848
His name is Alan Denado.

49:53.240 --> 49:56.483

50:59.320 --> 51:01.322
<i>Can you hear anybody, Casey?</i>

51:01.520 --> 51:04.683
No, no, there's just music.

51:05.120 --> 51:06.167
Okay.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.966
Go ahead, you're good.
Check your fluids?

51:27.920 --> 51:29.649
I think I have an idea.

51:33.360 --> 51:35.806
You don't have to do that.
No problem for me.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.331
Don't need it.

Sure.

53:52.320 --> 53:54.402
Oh, my... No, no, no!

53:57.560 --> 53:59.642
No!
You stupid...

53:59.840 --> 54:01.285
Come here.
No. No.

54:01.480 --> 54:04.529
Get off me! No, you...
You just keep killing people.

54:04.760 --> 54:07.491
Aah! You motherfucker!

54:19.680 --> 54:21.125
That's him.

54:22.560 --> 54:27.009
That is him.
Adam-16, we got a hit on that print.

54:27.240 --> 54:29.607
Suspect is a Michael Lewis Foster.

54:29.760 --> 54:32.843
<i>Record's clean on this guy,
no convictions except for...</i>

54:33.080 --> 54:37.449
He was booked for arson back in '95
but he was cleared. That's our guy.

54:44.080 --> 54:47.926
Got him. He's 36, 6'1", 182 pounds.

54:48.120 --> 54:50.805
Current address,
451 Shannon Court.

55:08.280 --> 55:09.691
Police. Don't move.
Oh! Oh!

55:09.880 --> 55:12.121
Is Michael Foster in this house?

55:12.320 --> 55:15.130
- Ma'am, are you his wife?
- Upstairs is clear.

55:15.320 --> 55:16.890
Talk to me!
Yes, I am his wife.

55:17.080 --> 55:18.764
Where is your husband?
What is this?

55:19.000 --> 55:21.446
What the hell is...?
Tell me where he is.

55:21.640 --> 55:24.007
Listen to me.
We need your help and it's urgent.

55:24.160 --> 55:25.650
Where is your husband?

55:25.880 --> 55:28.929
Where? Where does he work?

He's a med tech.
What time did he leave?

55:31.680 --> 55:36.004
Phillips. Phillips.
What the hell is this about?

55:38.600 --> 55:42.047
Ma'am, you're not gonna wanna
hear this in front of your kids.

55:42.440 --> 55:44.522
Flora just got an assault.
Burn victim.

55:44.720 --> 55:47.166
Guy doused an attendant
at a gas station. Lit him up.

55:47.400 --> 55:50.051
Witnesses say the guy drove off
in a car. Guess what make.

55:50.280 --> 55:53.762
Black Lincoln. Get the gas station
address and go tell Jordan.

55:57.320 --> 56:01.166
This is Foster's office. Check it out.

56:02.720 --> 56:05.883
I thought that girl
kind of looked like our P.R.

56:16.280 --> 56:19.124
<i>8-Adam-16, we got a witness
puts suspect heading north</i>

56:19.280 --> 56:22.124
<i>on Sierra.
That's eight miles north of you.</i>

56:22.320 --> 56:24.641
Yeah, roger, he's not here.

56:24.840 --> 56:26.968
Adam-8-16, go to tac 43 please.

56:28.440 --> 56:30.010
Rog, tac 43.

56:30.240 --> 56:33.369
<i>I still have the P. R. on the line
but she's not responding.</i>

56:33.560 --> 56:36.006
You got anything for me, Paul?

56:36.240 --> 56:37.571
I don't know yet.

57:05.800 --> 57:08.531
Please. Please. Please.

57:15.600 --> 57:18.206
Jordan. Jordan. Jordan!
Shit.

57:18.840 --> 57:20.365
<i>I'm here, Jordan.</i>
Casey.

57:20.560 --> 57:22.244
<i>Shut up!</i>

57:22.440 --> 57:26.001
Shit. Shh. Shh. Shh.
Please let me go.

57:26.200 --> 57:28.168
Shut up.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.081
<i>No.</i>

57:43.280 --> 57:45.248
Michael.

57:48.240 --> 57:50.561
The police know who you are,
Michael Foster.

57:51.880 --> 57:54.645
And they're at your house right now
with your family.

57:57.280 --> 57:59.203
Who is this?

58:03.160 --> 58:05.811
This is 911 emergency services.

58:06.040 --> 58:08.771
And we've got your prints
at the scene of a murder.

58:10.520 --> 58:14.889
<i>The only choice you have now
is to turn yourself in.</i>

58:16.840 --> 58:19.047
<i>No, please.</i>

58:19.240 --> 58:22.244
Michael, listen to me.

58:24.800 --> 58:27.121
Do not hurt that little girl.

58:29.840 --> 58:32.844
Do not hurt that little girl.
Let her go.

58:34.400 --> 58:36.050
You don't have to do this.

58:40.400 --> 58:41.925
<i>It's already done.</i>

58:42.160 --> 58:44.447
<i>No. No. No! No!</i>

58:44.640 --> 58:46.051
It's already done.

59:05.360 --> 59:07.040
The signal died. We just lost him.

59:08.360 --> 59:12.843
Michael Foster is the same man
that killed Leah Templeton.

59:13.040 --> 59:14.405
Jordan.
It's the same man.

59:14.840 --> 59:17.081
Jordan.
It's the same man.

59:26.240 --> 59:28.242
<i>Adam-16, we lost the trace.</i>

59:28.440 --> 59:31.762
But the last ping was off the tower
in Santa Clarita Hills.

59:36.840 --> 59:38.490
Tell me where
he may have taken her.

59:38.720 --> 59:42.441
There is no place because Michael
wouldn't do something like that.

59:42.640 --> 59:44.483
Where's this house?
You have no right.

59:44.720 --> 59:47.087
I have a right to arrest
you for obstruction.

59:47.280 --> 59:49.362
Where is the house?

59:49.960 --> 59:52.486
- That's where Michael grew up.
- But where is it?

59:52.640 --> 59:55.723
It's gone. It's gone.
It burned down years ago.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.686
Burned down?
Okay, what about this cottage?

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.850
The red one behind the house.
It's ours.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.850
What do you mean, it's yours?
You still own it?

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.368
Yes, we own it.
Michael's been renovating it.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.681
Ma'am, a girl may die if you don't help.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.167
You understand?
You don't want that.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.687
Tell us where it is.
Just tell us where it is.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:33.642
8-Adam-16, I need to run a plate.
1-Mary-2-5-8-Lincoln-9.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.645
We got an old
registration for Melinda Foster.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.490
Old registration. Deceased.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.891
Address, 1765 Oakcreek Lane.
In the Santa Clarita Hills.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:50.929
Supervisor at Brent Vista
says he left before noon.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.288
8-Adam-16,
contact the watch commander.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.807
We're gonna need backup units
and an airship.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.169
Roger on that. It's on the way.
Go to tac 41, please.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.964
Yeah, roger, tac 41.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.321
<i>Paul?</i>
Yeah?

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.320
Foster, that's the same guy
that killed Leah Templeton.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.447
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.287
Be careful.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.410
L.A.P.D. We're coming in!

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.329
<i>- Spread out.</i>
<i>- Room clear.</i>

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.486
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.091
Clear here.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.521
<i>- Nothing.</i>
<i>- Outside, west wall,</i>

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.081
<i>covered. Back here.</i>

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:04.563
8-Adam-16, it's empty.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.808
No sign of Foster
or the girl or the Lincoln.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.803
<i>This place is a dead end.</i>

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.685
Either he figured we were onto him
and he never showed,

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.410
or he's taken her somewhere.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.329
<i>Let's clear out of here.</i>

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:19.650
<i>I want barricades on all incoming roads
within five miles of the cell tower.</i>

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.165
I know. I said his name, scared him off.
No, that's not true.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.647
He found the cell
and he would have disconnected.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.525
He was on his way there, Maddy.
The trace confirmed it.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.404
That's not what happened.
Yeah.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.728
No, it isn't. We had a trace going,

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:47.404
and you did every single thing exactly
the way you were supposed to do it.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.887
I want you to go home.
Oh, I'm not going home.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.690
This isn't a request.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.567
You want closure.
You're not gonna get it.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.366
You did your part,
now you let them do their part.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.530
She's no longer your responsibility.
So I want you to go home,

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.206
and I want you
to take care of yourself.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.610
Please. Please.

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.926
Oh, you're not gonna wanna see that.

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.921
No. No.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.804
I told you
you didn't wanna see it.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.686
<i>You promise you're gonna find me?</i>

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.569
<i>I can promise you
this, sweetheart, okay...</i>

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.809
<i>...Age, Casey. Twenties, 30s, 40s?</i>

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.129
<i>Thirties, I think. Like mid-30s.</i>

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.047
<i>- Bridesmaids.
- Are you kidding me?</i>

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.050
<i>I love that movie.
I think I saw it about...</i>

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.969
<i>You told me that.</i>

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.367
<i>Okay, so you know
what we're gonna do right now?</i>

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.010
<i>We're gonna fight.</i>

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.521
<i>You and me, we 're gonna fight.</i>

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.524
<i>Michael, listen to me.</i>

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.204
<i>Do not hurt that little girl.</i>

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.168
<i>Do not hurt that little girl. Let her go.</i>

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.087
<i>You don't have to do this.</i>

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.602
<i>It's already done.</i>

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.642
<i>You don't have to do this.</i>

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.766
<i>It's al...</i>

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.961
<i>You don't have to do this.</i>

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.608
<i>It's already done.</i>

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.242
<i>It's already done.</i>

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.642
<i>It's already done.</i>

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.444
<i>No, no. No!</i>

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.606
Check each and
every car twice. Twice.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.247
Double check, triple check.
He's not getting through this point.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.241
He is not getting through here.
Help them look.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.443
Phillips.
Hey. You got anything?

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.246
No, not yet. Where are you?

01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.486
Where else?

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.290
<i>You're still at the Hive.</i>

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.482
Jordan. Listen to me, okay?

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:06.564
We will find her, all right?
And we'll find her alive.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.331
<i>All right, now you go home
and get you some rest.</i>

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:14.082
And, hey, you were an all-star tonight.

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.805
You really were, okay?

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:17.846
Paul.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.645
<i>Listen, I'll call you
as soon as we get a lead.</i>

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:21.886
Thank you.

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.603
Call you later.

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:28.528
Move it up! Move it up! Move it up!

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.242
<i>You have arrived at your destination.</i>

01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:29.001
<i>Your route guidance is now finished.</i>

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.728
Hi.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.005
No.

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.370
No.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.164
No. No.

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.522
No! No!

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:01.326
No! No!

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.725
Hey, Jordan.

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:11.321
Hey, we found the Lincoln.

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:13.807
He ditched it in the woods.

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:16.886
Denado's body was inside,
but there was, uh...

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.043
There was no sign of the girl.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.481
Call me when you get this.

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.768
Please, just kill me.

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.962
Kill me, please.

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:19.926
Please, just kill me. Just kill me.

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:24.489
Why won't you just kill me?

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.847
Hair needs a healthy blood flow.

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.565
If you're dead...

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.688
No, please stop, please.

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.245
Then it dies too.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.727
Stop, please.

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.005
I'm sorry, but I can't.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.161
I can't.

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:56.003
I can't stop.

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.645
Oh... Oh, God.

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:20.011
Oh... Okay, it's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.290
Don't worry, okay?

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.889
Who are you?

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:34.163
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.283
Jordan?
Yeah.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.285
Yeah.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:42.165
It's Jordan.
I'm gonna get you out of here. Okay?

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.085
Trash!

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:35.880
Aah! Shit!

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.491
Go! Go!

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.924
Trash!

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:57.124
Go, go!

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:03.529
Go, go. Go! Go, go.

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.128
Oh, my God.

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.364
Wait.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.764
You should have
listened to me, Michael Foster.

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:39.408
You could have turned yourself in
when you had the chance.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.490
Oh.

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:47.566
You're the operator.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.006
Thought you'd be taller.

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:05.082
So when do the police get here?

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:07.882
The police?

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:11.123
Yeah.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.043
I escaped.

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:17.208
Jordan found me in the woods.

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:19.484
And you...

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.805
disappeared.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.411
What?

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:31.203
Where do you think you're going, huh?
Where you going? Hey!

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:34.244
Hey! Unh! Wait!

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.801
Hey, where you think
you're going, you bitch?

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.444
You're just an operator.
You can't do this.

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:43.321
You can't.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.766
It's already done.
No. Wait!

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.891
<i>911, where's your emergency?</i>
