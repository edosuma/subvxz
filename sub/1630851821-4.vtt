WEBVTT

04:22.128 --> 04:23.997
Where is my brother?

04:24.063 --> 04:26.699
We're moving in. Be alert, guys
Go, go, go, go!

04:30.803 --> 04:31.804
Watch your head.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.218
Get in there now. Move it!

04:59.565 --> 05:03.569
-All clear to move in.
-Copy that. Let's go!

05:25.124 --> 05:26.726
We're moving in. Let's go!

05:41.074 --> 05:44.644
I'm going in. Come, cover me.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.599
Northern container clear.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.228
Bring her in, Doc.

09:17.256 --> 09:18.958
What are you going to do to me?

09:23.529 --> 09:24.764
Bring her in, Doc.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.140
No! Let me go!

09:34.206 --> 09:36.776
Let me go
What do you want from me?

09:36.842 --> 09:39.612
No! No!

09:39.679 --> 09:42.048
What do you want from me?

09:42.114 --> 09:44.450
What do you want from me? No!

09:44.517 --> 09:46.752
No! Please!

09:46.819 --> 09:51.123
What are you going to do
No, please!

09:51.457 --> 09:52.491
Please!

09:54.393 --> 09:57.630
Please, I beg you!

09:58.397 --> 10:01.500
Don't leave me in here! Please!

10:42.141 --> 10:43.075
Guys.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.645
They smashed the antenna tuner.

10:47.546 --> 10:49.782
There's a backup generato
in the basement.

10:50.182 --> 10:53.986
We need to restore powe
to install a security perimeter.

10:54.954 --> 10:57.089
They'll kill us if we stay here.

10:57.623 --> 10:59.959
Those creatures out ther
trashed the place.

11:00.026 --> 11:01.160
Can't you see that?

11:02.795 --> 11:03.729
Rojas.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.333
Let's leave that bitch her
and split.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.136
Right, and let her rot in there.

11:11.037 --> 11:13.506
Didn't she almost kill you
you, asshole?

11:14.807 --> 11:16.642
-I have an idea
-What?

11:17.109 --> 11:19.812
Why don't we torture he
like you guys always do?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.755
Hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it!

11:31.157 --> 11:32.558
Stop it. Stop it!

11:33.225 --> 11:34.193
Stop it.

11:35.628 --> 11:38.397
I can climb up the towe
and fix the radio.

11:38.464 --> 11:39.532
Right.

11:39.799 --> 11:42.535
Okay, after the storm clears.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.237
Jackson, Díaz
go get the generator.

11:45.304 --> 11:47.807
Then get some rest
We do three hour shifts.

11:51.177 --> 11:53.913
We move out if after six hour
we can't reach them.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.218
Let's see who's aliv
in six hours.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.162
What are we going to d
with her?

12:12.031 --> 12:13.966
We can't just keep running.

12:15.334 --> 12:18.104
She can help us find ou
what's going on.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.507
I'll check out the dispensary.

13:11.657 --> 13:14.426
-All clear here. Moving on.
-Copy that.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.960
I can see you, guys
Doc, come to the control room.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.545
I brought you clothes and food.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.882
I'll put them on the floo
and then open the door.

16:03.929 --> 16:05.531
Did you puke again?

16:05.597 --> 16:07.199
Do you have a fever?

16:10.269 --> 16:11.670
Is that why I'm here?

16:14.273 --> 16:17.576
Please, listen to me
I'm not sick. I'm fine.

16:18.410 --> 16:22.581
They drugged me or something
I don't know, but I'm fine.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.750
I'm just confused, that's all.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.720
Someone was with you, right
Luisa?

16:28.854 --> 16:30.289
Yes, she's my friend.

16:31.123 --> 16:33.892
What happened to you guys
Were you kidnapped?

16:34.259 --> 16:36.195
I don't remember
We were together.

16:36.261 --> 16:37.863
Did they hurt you?

16:37.930 --> 16:42.301
I don't know, we were together
That's all I remember.

16:42.601 --> 16:44.103
What's with the paintings?

16:46.271 --> 16:48.507
I don't... I don't know
I don't know.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.310
Look at this picture.

16:53.278 --> 16:58.384
-Do you know him
-No. I don't know who he is.

16:59.318 --> 17:01.020
-You never saw him before
-No.

17:01.086 --> 17:03.122
-Are you sure
-Yes, I'm sure.

17:07.159 --> 17:09.194
Please don't go!

17:09.795 --> 17:12.297
Please don't leave me here!

17:42.795 --> 17:44.730
Rojas, activity in the kitchen.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.275
Shut up. Shut up.

20:00.766 --> 20:03.135
Doc, I need you in the kitchen.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.204
Díaz, cover hi
in the control room.

20:11.977 --> 20:14.680
KITCHEN - COLD ROOM

20:23.155 --> 20:24.323
He's wounded.

20:31.463 --> 20:32.397
Easy.

20:42.774 --> 20:44.876
Calm down. Calm down! Calm down!

20:51.149 --> 20:53.919
Who are these guys
Where did they come from?

20:53.986 --> 20:57.022
They were hiding in the col
room with a bunch of bodies.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.771
They took them away?

21:19.678 --> 21:21.013
What the hell is bù yào?

21:39.331 --> 21:40.565
What's going on, Rojas?

21:42.301 --> 21:44.036
There might be a boat.

21:44.536 --> 21:45.937
We're gonna check it out.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.222
You're moving awa
from the camera.

22:38.890 --> 22:39.825
Got it.

22:41.226 --> 22:42.160
Gate.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.880
KITCHEN - COLD ROOM

26:28.620 --> 26:29.554
Rojas.

26:31.456 --> 26:32.390
Corporal.

26:35.994 --> 26:37.429
It's almost dawn.

27:13.765 --> 27:15.800
What are you looking for, Díaz?

27:15.867 --> 27:18.403
There's nothing here to hel
you. It's all gone.

27:20.605 --> 27:23.241
-Let me examine you
-What for, Doc?

27:27.245 --> 27:29.881
-How long has it been
-Two years.

27:30.582 --> 27:34.285
-Has our unit's shrink seen you
-Every six months just like you.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.622
Is this the worst it gets?

27:38.289 --> 27:41.593
Unless we talk about Zeus
My puppy.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.264
I called him Jackso
just to bug that black bitch.

27:47.032 --> 27:50.635
They gave him to me as a pupp
when I joined Special Forces.

27:51.436 --> 27:54.305
I had to keep hi
for about eight months,

27:54.372 --> 27:56.274
then they put us on a chopper

27:56.341 --> 27:58.843
and left us in the jungl
to see if we'd survive.

28:01.212 --> 28:04.215
Guess what happene
when I returned to our base.

28:04.282 --> 28:06.418
I had to kill it and eat it.

28:07.452 --> 28:11.923
That was the final test
Killing and eating my own dog.

28:12.590 --> 28:15.694
Then I had to let out a war cr
to our commando.

28:15.760 --> 28:16.928
Want to hear it?

28:16.995 --> 28:18.396
That's not necessary.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.543
Tell me I'm the only wack
in this shitty unit.

28:33.578 --> 28:34.512
Say it.

28:55.834 --> 28:58.603
So Luisa is your friend
Look what I found.

28:59.704 --> 29:01.072
Where did you get that?

29:03.875 --> 29:05.343
Want to see more?

29:07.712 --> 29:09.280
Where is my friend?

29:10.148 --> 29:11.750
What's that? Where is Luisa?

29:11.816 --> 29:14.552
-Do you
-No. Where is Luisa? Answer me!

29:14.619 --> 29:16.588
What's with the sketches?

29:16.654 --> 29:17.989
What is this crap?

29:18.056 --> 29:21.126
-Where is she
-What are these damn sketches?

29:21.192 --> 29:22.260
Where is Luisa?

29:22.327 --> 29:24.562
Who are yo
and what were you doing there?

29:25.797 --> 29:28.399
You lied to me
Do you know those guys?

29:29.601 --> 29:31.202
Why did they draw this?

29:31.269 --> 29:33.171
Who are yo
and why were you there?

29:33.238 --> 29:34.906
I'm an anthropologist.

29:34.973 --> 29:37.542
Luisa and I were researchin
the locals.

29:37.609 --> 29:38.710
What locals?

29:38.777 --> 29:41.579
The Indians
we were carrying out a census

29:41.646 --> 29:43.681
when we started hearin
these stories.

29:43.748 --> 29:44.682
What stories?

29:44.749 --> 29:48.052
Stories about an unknown tribe
Superstitions.

29:48.586 --> 29:51.456
They talked abou
some savage witch doctors

29:51.523 --> 29:54.425
who killed peopl
to turn them into monsters.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.127
Monsters?

29:57.295 --> 29:58.730
When we got here

29:58.797 --> 30:01.933
the workers had gone crazy
murdering each other.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.702
Why? What was wrong with them?

30:04.769 --> 30:05.904
I don't know.

30:05.970 --> 30:09.474
I don't know because we realize
we were in danger, so we left.

30:11.876 --> 30:13.511
Why didn't you tell me this?

30:13.878 --> 30:15.613
Because I was scared.

30:18.082 --> 30:19.884
The guy in that picture...

30:23.121 --> 30:25.256
-He was with them
-Where?

30:25.924 --> 30:29.661
Nearby, somewhere upstream
Not too far away from here.

30:32.297 --> 30:33.598
Where is Luisa?

30:35.200 --> 30:37.635
Where is my friend? Please!

30:38.970 --> 30:42.273
-What happened to her
-She's dead. Sorry.

30:44.876 --> 30:46.845
Where are you, Luisa?

30:54.752 --> 30:58.857
Jackson, climb up the tower
fix the freaking antenna tuner.

30:58.923 --> 31:00.558
The antenna's fine, man.

31:00.625 --> 31:04.395
Shoot anyon
trying to access the perimeter.

31:04.462 --> 31:05.797
I don't care who it is.

31:08.800 --> 31:09.734
Okay.

31:11.202 --> 31:12.136
Doc.

31:14.639 --> 31:17.876
Check all entrances
seal the one we came through.

31:34.926 --> 31:35.927
Are you okay?

31:37.528 --> 31:38.496
Yes.

31:44.602 --> 31:47.005
You are the best spotte
I've ever known.

31:47.839 --> 31:50.041
We've shared tons of shit
haven't we?

31:51.809 --> 31:54.579
But right no
I need you to be totally sober.

31:55.546 --> 31:57.649
You won't let me die
right, bastard?

31:57.982 --> 31:58.917
Never.

32:01.319 --> 32:02.887
Focus on those screens.

33:49.594 --> 33:51.396
Possible activity at 20 meters.

34:06.377 --> 34:07.412
What's going on?

34:08.279 --> 34:09.580
-Díaz
-I don't know.

34:11.282 --> 34:13.785
SOUTHERN PERIMETER

34:29.667 --> 34:30.835
It must be them.

34:36.140 --> 34:37.141
What is it?

34:43.648 --> 34:45.083
I see three figures.

34:55.026 --> 34:55.960
Shoot!

35:10.441 --> 35:11.409
Don't shoot!

35:11.476 --> 35:14.579
Hold your fire
They're recon. Repeat, recon.

35:15.012 --> 35:15.947
Stay put.

35:17.348 --> 35:18.549
I'm on my way.

36:04.095 --> 36:05.229
What now, Rojas?

36:40.932 --> 36:42.867
It's okay
Go back to your positions.

36:45.903 --> 36:47.638
Welcome, Corporal.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.009
We though
you had crossed the border.

36:52.677 --> 36:56.147
We saw the chopper crash too
so we came to get you guys.

36:59.317 --> 37:00.918
Are you letting us in or not?

37:04.322 --> 37:05.856
Who is that bastard?

37:08.793 --> 37:10.595
They were here when we arrived.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.030
Rojas, look at her.

37:14.265 --> 37:17.635
She's sick. Don't let her in.

37:36.354 --> 37:37.655
Well, Corporal?

37:45.296 --> 37:48.399
Díaz, go to the control roo
and open de gate.

37:54.705 --> 37:56.307
Go open the gate.

37:56.807 --> 37:57.775
Now!

38:19.263 --> 38:21.465
WESTERN PERIPHERY

38:32.109 --> 38:34.045
Díaz, open the gate.

39:19.557 --> 39:21.292
-How are you feeling
-I'm fine.

39:23.227 --> 39:25.696
Open up. Stick your tongue out.

39:27.331 --> 39:30.668
We found a chopper. We though
you had left on another one.

39:31.802 --> 39:33.304
There was only one chopper.

39:34.872 --> 39:36.307
What do you mean just one?

39:37.575 --> 39:39.043
After it crashed,

39:39.110 --> 39:42.279
Jackson saw Matias' guy
escorting a Gringo hazmat team.

39:43.948 --> 39:45.616
What the fuck do you mean?

39:46.283 --> 39:49.453
-They didn't come to rescue us
-So why did they come?

39:55.426 --> 39:56.727
Don't look at me.

39:58.596 --> 40:00.464
What do I have to do with it?

40:03.000 --> 40:04.635
You examined me before
Enough!

40:04.702 --> 40:06.470
-Hey
-Calm down.

40:06.937 --> 40:08.739
Pardo's just tired, that's all.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.309
I need to examin
all three of you.

40:12.376 --> 40:13.344
No way.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.249
The woman we found puked too.

40:18.315 --> 40:21.185
People puke in the jungle
Right, Doc?

40:22.420 --> 40:25.723
We need to take precautions
We don't know what's going on.

40:25.790 --> 40:26.924
Precautions, Doc?

40:28.359 --> 40:29.927
Screw the precautions.

40:29.994 --> 40:32.730
If we've got something
so do you guys.

40:33.497 --> 40:36.500
I don't know about that
I don't have any symptoms.

40:36.567 --> 40:38.569
We carried her aroun
from day one.

40:38.636 --> 40:39.970
Stop pointing at me.

40:40.471 --> 40:43.441
We're here because we though
you needed help.

40:46.644 --> 40:47.611
Right, Corporal?

41:27.952 --> 41:31.922
This is not the freaking way
We're walking around in circles!

41:57.581 --> 41:59.850
We need to examin
all three of you.

42:02.386 --> 42:03.754
I don't need this.

42:07.758 --> 42:09.460
Did you lock us in, Corporal?

42:33.050 --> 42:34.618
Fire!

42:42.993 --> 42:43.994
Pardo!

42:44.762 --> 42:45.930
Hurry!

42:48.832 --> 42:49.833
Cover yourselves!

42:58.943 --> 43:00.578
KITCHEN - COLD ROOM

43:11.055 --> 43:14.325
Move it! Move it! Hurry!

43:18.162 --> 43:20.564
Move it! Hurry!

43:27.538 --> 43:28.572
Let's go!

43:29.640 --> 43:30.608
Come on!

43:45.155 --> 43:46.857
Careful.

43:47.658 --> 43:49.059
Go, go.

43:50.227 --> 43:51.161
Careful!

43:51.495 --> 43:53.163
Help me!

43:53.230 --> 43:56.500
Help me! Please!

44:15.352 --> 44:18.656
Help! Get me out of here!

44:23.394 --> 44:24.328
Move back!
