Wilford knew exactly how to hit us.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.683
He has to have someone over here.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.978
Someone who told him about the tensions.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.190
People are gonna blame the Tail.
I have to make this right.

02:30.441 --> 02:31.609

I promise you it wasn't the Tail--

Please get away from them.

It's a snaking motion. Come on.

[Osweiller] There's a lot more blood

[LJ] Detective.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.834
-What a caseload.
-I could use your help.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.169
The Tailies did it.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.297
And even if they didn't,
just pin it on them like you used to.

04:16.381 --> 04:18.341
Give her a break. She had a rough night.

04:19.467 --> 04:20.760
What do you need?

04:21.427 --> 04:23.596
I found this over there, on the floor.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.557
It's vintage Wilford. Old-style W.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.143
Ever seen one before? Maybe up in First?

04:30.561 --> 04:31.396
No.

04:31.479 --> 04:33.147
You didn't even look at it.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.777
Oh… Still no. [chuckles]

04:38.653 --> 04:39.696
Forget it.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.616
[Osweiller] Hey, hey, hey.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.495
I know someone who might be able to help.

04:48.121 --> 04:48.955
Who?

04:49.038 --> 04:51.416
This woman, Katya,
has a couchette full of vintage stuff.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.669
Wanna take me?

04:55.420 --> 04:56.254
Okay.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.883
[Ruth] She was standing right there
with him, across the border.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.345
I couldn't hear much, but it looked like
he was offering her a choice.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.555
She chose to stay?

05:05.638 --> 05:08.433
That's what it looked like,
but I cannot know her motives.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.226
It was a risk sending Audrey over there.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.812
Well, she was there
on a mission for you, wasn't she?

05:12.895 --> 05:13.896
Did she complete it?

05:13.980 --> 05:16.107
No. We still don't have access
to their comms.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.318
So, maybe she just
stayed behind to finish the job.

05:19.319 --> 05:23.114
But either way, she's "Miss Audrey,
Doyenne of the Nightcar."

05:23.197 --> 05:26.409
She's one of us.
Looks like a defection even if it isn't.

anything about that, right?

One sec, gentlemen. Here she comes.

if I'm holding you against your will.

I'm fine.

We have to assume
that she's been compromised.

Yeah, we do.

then you're not supposed to know.

-Why not?
-I don't know.

We gotta go uptrain, get everyone,
make sure they get back home safe.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.259
Yeah. But not him.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.719
He sticks out like a sore thumb.

turned back at the border last night,

11:02.370 --> 11:03.579
Well, you're still here.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.791

but they were his rules.

Yes, we had order.

You wanna do that job again?

-So, why is it all on you?
-Layton has enough to deal with.

He should do something about it.

You wanna prove yourself.

all murdered at the same time.

willing to kill for Wilford.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.366
<i>…by taking out our best.</i>

14:28.200 --> 14:30.077
<i>We can't start turning on each other.</i>

14:30.995 --> 14:33.080
<i>That is exactly what they want to happen.</i>

14:33.914 --> 14:37.042
<i>Whoever did this terrible crime</i>

14:37.126 --> 14:40.004
wants you to believe
that it was the weakest among us.

14:40.087 --> 14:41.255
Bullshit!

14:41.839 --> 14:42.882
Layton was a Tailie.

14:44.675 --> 14:48.387
[Layton on PA] <i>But the real enemy</i>
<i>is back there on </i>Big Alice,

14:48.470 --> 14:50.014
<i>lying in wait.</i>

14:50.097 --> 14:52.349
<i>Some of your neighbors support his return,</i>

14:53.017 --> 14:55.561
<i>but we cast away Wilford Law once already,</i>

14:55.644 --> 14:58.814
and I will remind you
of the call that unites us.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.651
We are one train.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.321
<i>Snowpiercer.</i>

15:05.404 --> 15:08.407
-This is not what we fought for.
-[all] Yeah.

15:08.490 --> 15:12.453
[all cheering] Wilford! Wilford!

15:14.914 --> 15:16.457
[PA system chimes]

15:23.505 --> 15:26.175
I'm not sure they'll take that
the way you want them to.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.801
[Layton] I had to defend the Tail.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.929
They don't have a voice right now.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.723
Bringing Mr. Wilford into it,
you're asking them to pick sides.

15:32.806 --> 15:33.933
He had to do something.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.939
Well, then, by all means, carry on.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.152
[Layton] She might be right, you know?

15:46.528 --> 15:48.530
We both know this is just the beginning.

15:52.868 --> 15:53.702
I stayed.

15:54.536 --> 15:55.621
Isn't that what you wanted?

15:55.704 --> 15:58.290
I want you with me, Audrey.
Really with me.

16:01.543 --> 16:02.586
I can't do it alone.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.589
Well, then trust me like I'm trusting you.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.008
I think I should know
what I've gotten myself into.

16:09.843 --> 16:12.596
-You want all our cards on the table?
-Yes.

16:21.772 --> 16:25.192
I found this screwdriver in your things
while you were taking a bath.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.904
You want to tell me what it's for?

16:31.907 --> 16:33.784
I think you know what it's for.

16:34.952 --> 16:38.747
Swap the comm lines,
so <i>Snowpiercer</i> can listen in on my Engine.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.292
-Did you do it?
-No.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.381
Did you stay here so you could
complete your little mission?

16:50.551 --> 16:51.510
No.

16:55.639 --> 16:59.268
I stayed… because I feel a pull.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.020
Right here.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.898
But after everything you've done to me,

17:06.692 --> 17:08.193
I don't understand it.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.319
But I'm still here.

17:10.029 --> 17:10.988
[gasps]

17:12.906 --> 17:14.950
I don't believe you.

17:15.617 --> 17:16.869
Get dressed.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.787
There's someone I want you to meet.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.965
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.719
[Wilford] You're going to have to
prove yourself like everyone else.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.513
[man sobbing]

17:36.597 --> 17:37.806
Joseph, what's going on?

17:40.309 --> 17:44.813
You see, this poor member of my crew
has gone all to pieces.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.608
He needs your help.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.359
[sobbing continues]

17:57.493 --> 18:00.746
[man] No, no, no!

18:00.829 --> 18:03.248
Leave me alone!

18:03.332 --> 18:04.500
No, leave me alone.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.126
Leave me alone.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.254
Leave me alone!

18:10.881 --> 18:12.758
No! Please, no!

18:15.844 --> 18:16.845
This is Kevin.

18:19.973 --> 18:21.100
I need you to fix him.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.770
[sobs and exclaims]

18:35.155 --> 18:37.908
Layton's revolution
was supposed to be for all of us!

18:37.991 --> 18:41.286
To hell with him!
Once a Tailie, always a Tailie.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.289
[Clifford] This is Wilford's train.
Always was, always will be.

18:44.998 --> 18:48.335
-Let's get some Tailies! Come on!
-Man, Layton's in for it now.

18:48.418 --> 18:50.921
-[woman] Go! Go! Go!
-[clamoring]

18:51.004 --> 18:52.881
[rock music playing over headphones]

18:57.344 --> 18:59.429
Pike, you good?

19:00.305 --> 19:01.932
Layton.

19:03.684 --> 19:04.685
My man.

19:05.644 --> 19:09.398
-I'm good.
-You sure? Because you don't, uh…

19:10.440 --> 19:11.650
You don't look so good.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.989
[Pike] Thing with Terence
didn't quite go as planned,

19:19.324 --> 19:23.537
but I take comfort
in knowing that you now owe me.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.749
Yeah, hey, I got your back.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.086
Now why don't you head back to the Tail?
Okay? It's dangerous--

19:31.170 --> 19:33.172
No, I'm good.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.381
You're a target.

19:34.464 --> 19:37.801
-Nobody recognizes me like this, Layton.
-Really?

19:39.386 --> 19:41.388
I checked the ledger.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.558
I did the figures.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.187
And I have proven

19:49.396 --> 19:55.444
that the scale is actually
now a little more in Pike's favor.

19:56.403 --> 19:58.071
I counted your debt.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.159
-You are now marked.
-Hey.

20:07.456 --> 20:08.373
Okay.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.884
Oh, hey. This way. Lay low.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.599
Is he okay?

20:26.642 --> 20:28.352
Uh, I think I messed him up.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.689
Come on. You can turn this around.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.278
-Ah, there you are.
-Where were you?

20:40.155 --> 20:42.366
Audrey's helping me with something.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.450
[Alex] With what?

20:44.326 --> 20:47.246
Uh, a little project. You'll see.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.667
You're shutting me out again.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.001
I wonder why that is.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.630
Because instead
of taking <i>Snowpiercer</i> like you promised,

20:56.713 --> 20:59.383
you would rather
just mess around with your whore.

20:59.466 --> 21:00.300
Oh.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.053
I do love your nerve, Alex.

21:05.847 --> 21:08.600
But you don't want to make this personal.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.563
You used to tell me everything.

21:14.898 --> 21:17.901
And you used to appreciate
everything I've done for you.

21:18.568 --> 21:21.947
But then you let Melanie in,
took her into the barracks in secret.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.449
Yes, I knew about that.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.535
I expect you had some lovely hugs.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.830
I shouldn't have to choose
between you and Melanie.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.873
Oh, but you do. You do have to choose.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.293
You spend one week with her,

21:35.502 --> 21:37.129
and you forget that I saved you.

21:37.212 --> 21:41.174
You should be thanking me every day
for rescuing you from the cold.

21:41.258 --> 21:44.761
Every day you breathe
on this Earth is a day I gave you.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.932
So, if you want to be part of my plans,

21:51.143 --> 21:52.728
you're gonna have to remind me…

21:54.646 --> 21:56.273
why I brought you along.

22:01.194 --> 22:02.279
[chuckles]

22:04.281 --> 22:06.199
-[Kevin sobbing]
-[shushes]

22:08.452 --> 22:09.453
It's okay.

22:10.871 --> 22:13.123
There's no reason to be ashamed.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.541
I can help you.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.335
[sobbing]

22:17.252 --> 22:18.170
Kevin.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.048
Kevin?

22:28.513 --> 22:30.807
I just keep seeing him in the bathtub.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.605
He took you to the bath?

22:51.870 --> 22:53.288
He must really like you.

22:55.457 --> 22:59.795
I understand his affection
can be confusing at first.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.881
But don't you wanna be rid of this pain?

23:07.385 --> 23:08.386
Can I see?

23:11.890 --> 23:14.017
[groaning]

23:14.101 --> 23:17.187
-It's healing nicely.
-Oh, my God.

23:17.270 --> 23:19.981
I know. I know.

23:20.607 --> 23:21.858
But you're almost there.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.028
Look.

23:26.905 --> 23:27.739
Look.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.950
Oh, my God! Oh, no…

23:30.700 --> 23:35.330
We both made the same choice
out of love for him.

23:35.413 --> 23:37.290
[sobbing] No.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.877
-He saved you.
-No. He broke me.

23:40.961 --> 23:43.046
-No. He saved you.
-No.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.798
You're just afraid.

23:46.258 --> 23:49.094
No one's ever loved you like him.
No one else will.

23:49.177 --> 23:50.929
You wanna be his again, don't you?

23:51.012 --> 23:54.099
-No!
-You were nothing until Wilford.

23:54.182 --> 23:57.102
-He gave you everything.
-No.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.271
-Just shut up!
-Stop.

23:59.354 --> 24:00.438
Shut up!

24:05.068 --> 24:06.194
Ow.

24:09.739 --> 24:12.242
[groaning]

24:14.911 --> 24:16.872
[Miss Audrey]
You're gonna have to go deeper, Kevin.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.249
Deeper and darker.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.419
[groans]

24:22.502 --> 24:23.962
This is what I do.

24:24.045 --> 24:26.965
I help people reconnect
with what they've lost.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.800
[Kevin] Oh, God…

24:31.636 --> 24:33.221
I need you to let go.

24:34.222 --> 24:37.559
I need you to calm down. Just give in.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.256
Well, what's all this?

25:08.340 --> 25:11.843
We found something
near one of the murders.

25:11.927 --> 25:12.928
Look familiar?

25:13.762 --> 25:15.972
It's vintage Wilford. Rare piece.

25:17.474 --> 25:19.059
I've never seen it before.

25:19.142 --> 25:20.227
Oh, yeah?

25:21.019 --> 25:23.813
Took the liberty of going through
your things. I hope you don't mind.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.945
-It must have fallen off somewhere.
-Yeah, I don't think so.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.076
Cherry the Breachman was strong.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.330
Come here.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.595
She fought back, didn't she?

25:55.679 --> 25:57.472
You killed her for Wilford.

25:58.848 --> 26:01.518
So, who's over here
calling the shots? Was it you?

26:04.604 --> 26:07.691
Oh, you're in so deep, Detective.

26:07.774 --> 26:09.943
You can't even see what's in front of you.

26:13.488 --> 26:17.117
You think you're so smart,
but you're always two steps behind.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.412
This train needs change, a new shepherd,

26:21.204 --> 26:24.082
and the revolution is starting right now.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.460
-Take her away.
-[Roche] Let's go. Buckle up, sweetheart.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.547
[clamoring]

26:34.718 --> 26:35.719
Go, go, go!

26:41.308 --> 26:42.434
Quick. In here.

26:54.529 --> 26:55.905
[thudding on door]

26:56.614 --> 26:58.241
[clamoring]

27:03.246 --> 27:04.706
There's trouble in the Market, too.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.877
It's gonna be the whole train soon enough.

27:09.794 --> 27:10.712
[Zarah] Ruth…

27:13.506 --> 27:15.133
-We have to move.
-[Clifford] Where are you going?

27:15.216 --> 27:17.969
Quick. In here. Come on.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.554
[man] Let's go!

27:19.637 --> 27:21.681
[thudding on door]

27:21.765 --> 27:23.892
Just Hospitality. Let's go.

27:26.144 --> 27:29.689
-What's going on here?
-They're trapped. Same as you.

27:34.235 --> 27:37.405
Zarah, call Tristan.
Tell him we're gonna need an escort.

27:39.949 --> 27:43.244
Right. Let's see
who we have here, then. Shall we?

27:47.290 --> 27:49.042
-Oh.
-[Winnie shrieks]

27:49.125 --> 27:50.210
[Ruth] What's the matter?

27:50.293 --> 27:51.503
What's wrong?

27:53.922 --> 27:56.674
-Lights?
-Winnie remembers her from the Tail.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.051
I was hardly ever in the Tail.

27:58.635 --> 27:59.969
You tried to take her arm.

28:00.637 --> 28:01.971
It wasn't that long ago.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.265
You took her mother's arm instead.
Remember?

28:07.143 --> 28:09.771
-Suzanne?
-[Lights] Yeah.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.690
She died
of complications from the de-arming.

28:19.322 --> 28:20.573
I don't know what to say.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.575
Where's her brother?

28:23.243 --> 28:24.911
He died fighting in the Revolution.

28:26.371 --> 28:27.580
I'm all she has left.

28:40.343 --> 28:41.511
[clamoring]

28:57.694 --> 28:59.154
-[Tristan] Ruth?
-Tristan?

28:59.237 --> 29:01.197
-[Tristan] Ruth?
-Tristan!

29:02.198 --> 29:03.199
Have you got the escort?

29:03.283 --> 29:06.870
No. There's a bit of a situation.
Targeted violence against Tailies.

29:06.953 --> 29:09.038
Outbreaks popping up all over the place.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.874
Tailies aren't safe out here.

29:12.667 --> 29:15.128
It's all right. Stay calm.

29:15.211 --> 29:16.337
Just give me a second.

29:17.046 --> 29:18.047
Where's that little girl?

29:18.840 --> 29:19.799
[Lights] Winnie?

29:19.883 --> 29:21.426
My God. She must have slipped out.

29:21.509 --> 29:22.761
-[Zarah] Lights.
-I have to find her.

29:22.844 --> 29:25.305
No! You can't go out there. No, I'll go.

29:25.388 --> 29:26.806
Zarah, you're in charge.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.892
-Don't you let anyone through this door.
-Okay.

29:38.276 --> 29:41.321
Little Winnie, dude.
What are you doing here?

29:41.404 --> 29:43.156
-It's dangerous.
-[Winne shrieks]

29:43.239 --> 29:44.365
What is it?

29:44.449 --> 29:46.034
-That one's a Tailie. I know him!
-No…

29:46.117 --> 29:48.036
-Grab him!
-[Pike] What do you want? No.

29:48.119 --> 29:49.454
-[man] I got him.
-Hey, get back!

29:49.537 --> 29:51.623
-[grunts]
-[people clamoring]

29:51.706 --> 29:54.292
[Pike] Let me go! Let me go!

29:57.086 --> 29:59.380
Stop! Let me go!

30:00.256 --> 30:02.217
Let me go!

30:03.051 --> 30:04.385
Let go of me!

30:06.679 --> 30:07.680
-No!
-[man] Grab his ankle.

30:07.764 --> 30:08.932
[Pike] Let me go!

30:09.516 --> 30:10.809
[man] Shut up!

30:10.892 --> 30:12.852
[Pike] I don't wanna shut up!

30:48.888 --> 30:49.889
[Layton] Slow down.

30:49.973 --> 30:54.018
"Their shepherds have led them astray."
He quoted it to me yesterday.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.144
I'm such an idiot.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.480
First Class bitch
was even wearing Saint Christopher.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.524
[Layton] Just give it to me one more time.

30:59.607 --> 31:04.696
Okay. I saw Pastor Logan give Boki
that same medallion this morning.

31:04.779 --> 31:06.739
Exactly like the one he gave me.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.409
You think he let Boki out on purpose?

31:09.492 --> 31:10.535
[West] On your left.

31:11.494 --> 31:13.037
Hold on. What's going on?

31:13.121 --> 31:16.916
Organized Wilford mobs keep popping up.
There are riots all over the place.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.127
They've even taken
a Tailie hostage downtrain.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.796
Go. I got this. I can handle it on my own.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.132
Good luck.

31:25.842 --> 31:27.051
[Ruth] Winnie?

31:32.724 --> 31:33.892
Winnie?

31:37.312 --> 31:40.106
-[Winnie crying]
-[Suzanne] <i>Be strong, Winnipeg.</i>

31:41.524 --> 31:42.525
I love you.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.074
[Ruth] Winnie? Winnie!

31:51.784 --> 31:53.077
[sighs] There you are.

31:53.161 --> 31:54.996
I've been looking
all over the train for you.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.290
How'd you get all the way up here?

31:59.375 --> 32:02.629
Look, you don't have to be scared of me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

32:02.712 --> 32:05.256
You have to come with me
so I can take you back…

32:07.508 --> 32:09.052
Take you back to your friends.

32:18.978 --> 32:19.854
Your mum…

32:24.984 --> 32:26.152
I'm sorry about your mum.

32:27.403 --> 32:29.822
You know,
I lost my mum, too, when I was little.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.369
It was cruel, what I did,
taking her away from you.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.126
I thought that
I was doing the right thing.

32:43.086 --> 32:44.420
I was following the rules.

32:48.883 --> 32:50.385
But that wasn't right, was it?

32:53.888 --> 32:54.889
It was wrong.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.767
I was very, very wrong.

33:03.356 --> 33:05.191
I wish I could take it back, Winnie.

33:08.736 --> 33:09.946
I wish that I could.

33:12.323 --> 33:13.241
[Winnie] I…

33:14.617 --> 33:16.661
I'm hiding from the bad men.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.246
I know.

33:19.414 --> 33:20.581
You're very clever.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.419
But I can keep you safe from them

33:25.378 --> 33:26.629
if you come with me.

33:27.296 --> 33:28.673
Will you come with me?

33:41.102 --> 33:42.311
Come on, sweetheart.

33:45.231 --> 33:46.065
Come on.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.956
[Miss Audrey] <i>Knowing you would do</i>
<i>anything for him</i>

34:02.040 --> 34:04.917
<i>is the most wonderful feeling</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

34:06.335 --> 34:07.587
<i>That loyalty…</i>

34:08.379 --> 34:10.965
<i>That loyalty, it's relief.</i>

34:11.674 --> 34:14.260
<i>It's a love very few people understand.</i>

34:30.276 --> 34:32.862
He's the only one who ever understood you.

34:32.945 --> 34:35.740
You were no one until Wilford.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.576
You owe him everything.

34:40.703 --> 34:42.205
I owe him everything.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.713
Thank you, Mr. Wilford.

34:51.964 --> 34:53.716
Thank you, Mr. Wilford.

34:55.593 --> 34:56.636
All right, Kevin.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.347
Stand up now.

35:02.600 --> 35:05.061
["You Were Mine" playing]

35:08.397 --> 35:09.315
[scoffs]

35:13.152 --> 35:14.153
Come.

35:53.484 --> 35:54.527
You look…

35:55.653 --> 35:56.863
reinvigorated.

35:58.739 --> 35:59.740
Well done.

36:02.118 --> 36:02.952
Kevin.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.337
Kneel for Mr. Wilford.

36:19.927 --> 36:21.762
Now lick Mr. Wilford's slipper.

36:45.661 --> 36:47.538
It's nice to have you back.

36:52.251 --> 36:53.294
Thank you.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.054
-[clamoring]
-[Pike] No!

37:03.137 --> 37:04.931
[man] Let's go! Let's go!

37:07.475 --> 37:09.685
No! Stop!

37:09.769 --> 37:11.312
No, not my arm!

37:11.395 --> 37:13.481
-[man] Shut it!
-[Pike] You don't have to do this.

37:13.564 --> 37:16.150
-Hey, we can make a deal.
-Shut him up!

37:17.443 --> 37:18.444
They're back.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.076
[Ruth] There you go.

37:26.285 --> 37:27.995
-[Lights] Thank you.
-Andre.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.705
Where are you going? What's going on?

37:29.789 --> 37:31.457
They got one of us downtrain.

37:31.540 --> 37:32.750
-A Tailie?
-[Layton] Yeah.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.714
-[Ruth] I'm coming with you.
-No.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.800
Please, can I just come with you?

37:40.883 --> 37:42.218
All right, let's go.

38:18.254 --> 38:19.255
[Pastor Logan] Bess.

38:22.383 --> 38:24.593
-Have a seat.
-Who were you talking to?

38:25.594 --> 38:26.595
Who else?

38:27.221 --> 38:28.639
You were praying?

38:28.723 --> 38:29.724
[Pastor Logan] Of course.

38:30.891 --> 38:34.145
Times like these
are when I need his guidance the most.

38:36.063 --> 38:37.982
What happened with Boki this morning,

38:38.941 --> 38:39.984
after I left?

38:43.195 --> 38:46.782
I gave him some space to grieve.

38:48.701 --> 38:51.329
-Something wrong?
-Is it all an act?

38:52.246 --> 38:53.247
What do you mean?

38:53.331 --> 38:54.540
The teacup.

38:56.459 --> 38:57.710
The spirituality.

38:59.128 --> 39:00.421
It's all bullshit, right?

39:01.422 --> 39:03.257
You're the one working for Wilford.

39:03.883 --> 39:04.717
Leave it.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.218
-Bess.
-Don't lie to me.

39:06.302 --> 39:07.595
I never lied to you.

39:11.349 --> 39:12.767
You weren't ready to listen.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.518
Were you just using me all this time?

39:14.602 --> 39:17.938
-That rage inside of you, I feel it, too.
-You don't know me.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.149
You were so desperate
for something to hold on to,

39:20.232 --> 39:21.275
something to believe in.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.735
I wanted to help you.

39:22.818 --> 39:24.612
You killed eight people.

39:27.031 --> 39:30.409
A small price to pay for peace.
Don't you think?

39:30.493 --> 39:31.744
[people clamoring]

39:38.876 --> 39:40.586
[Pike] No! No!

39:40.669 --> 39:42.129
[Layton] Let him go!

39:42.213 --> 39:43.839
We are done listening to you!

39:43.923 --> 39:45.633
[Layton] Jakes, I know you.

39:45.716 --> 39:47.468
Why are you doing this?
We fought together.

39:47.551 --> 39:50.346
-That was a mistake.
-Never should've let you out of the Tail.

39:50.429 --> 39:51.972
-[woman] Traitors!
-[Layton] Hey, stop it!

39:52.056 --> 39:54.725
Stop it! You wanna
punish somebody, take my arm.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.228
Take my arm. Let Pike go.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.271
No. No way, man.

39:59.355 --> 40:00.481
-No!
-[Layton] Hey!

40:00.564 --> 40:02.441
I am the one you want, right?

40:03.150 --> 40:05.194
-I'm the one you hate.
-Andre…

40:07.238 --> 40:09.949
I took everything that you had
and I gave it to my friends.

40:10.032 --> 40:12.743
So, take me. Here, arm me. Come on.

40:13.494 --> 40:15.788
-[man] Take him.
-[clamoring]

40:16.580 --> 40:19.291
Hey! No!

40:21.210 --> 40:22.628
No, no…

40:24.255 --> 40:25.256
No, wait!

40:32.179 --> 40:35.182
Stop it! Stop! This is barbaric!

40:35.266 --> 40:36.892
This man is your leader!

40:37.601 --> 40:38.936
You chose him!

40:39.728 --> 40:42.481
You want someone else
in charge, then call for change.

40:43.482 --> 40:47.820
But don't strip him down
and mutilate him just because you can.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.072
It's not right.

40:50.156 --> 40:52.199
Believe me, I know. I've done it.

40:54.869 --> 40:57.413
You'll never be
the same again once you have.

40:59.165 --> 41:00.416
This is not the way.

41:01.041 --> 41:02.376
Not anymore.

41:05.129 --> 41:05.963
Please.

41:06.046 --> 41:08.007
The Brakemen are coming. We gotta go.

41:08.591 --> 41:09.967
[Jakes] This ain't over.

41:12.845 --> 41:14.221
Yeah, piss off!

41:15.306 --> 41:18.100
[Jakes] Let's get out of here.
Come on, hurry up.

41:20.394 --> 41:21.812
[man] Watch yourself, Pike.

41:29.069 --> 41:30.529
We all crave stability,

41:31.572 --> 41:33.407
but Wilford brings order.

41:35.117 --> 41:36.911
We just have to suffer for a moment

41:37.912 --> 41:39.413
to get to our salvation.

41:41.290 --> 41:44.293
You can't find relief without… hurting.

41:49.131 --> 41:50.466
[both grunting]

41:58.766 --> 41:59.892
Do it.

42:01.435 --> 42:03.437
I am not going to kill you.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.731
If you die, no one learns the truth.

42:10.819 --> 42:12.071
[gasping]

42:28.671 --> 42:30.297
[speaking imperceptibly]

42:54.154 --> 42:55.364
[gasps]

42:56.657 --> 42:59.285
[Till] No, no, no.

43:08.335 --> 43:09.503
[coughing]

43:37.698 --> 43:40.034
-[Carly] Daddy!
-Did I miss the corkscrew?

43:40.618 --> 43:41.660
No. Come sit.

43:45.748 --> 43:46.874
-[Carly] Hey.
-[Roche] Hi.

44:02.556 --> 44:04.433
[Wilford] They're choosing sides, Alex.

44:07.227 --> 44:08.312
Come with me.

44:24.703 --> 44:25.704
What does it mean?

44:28.332 --> 44:30.209
They're calling for you, Joseph.

44:42.763 --> 44:44.264
[Carly] The train wants Wilford.

44:51.563 --> 44:53.107
Should we light one?

44:56.151 --> 44:57.444
I'm not sure yet.

45:01.115 --> 45:02.157
Andre?

45:19.049 --> 45:20.384
[exhales heavily]

45:28.892 --> 45:30.853
Tell the Headwoods to prep Icy Bob.

45:32.312 --> 45:33.313
It's time.
