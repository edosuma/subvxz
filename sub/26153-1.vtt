WEBVTT

00:08.633 --> 00:09.968
[Peter] All right, all set.

00:11.136 --> 00:12.470
Okay, you ready?

00:12.846 --> 00:13.722
Yeah.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.975
So, do you mind walking us through
what happened on November 6th?

00:17.475 --> 00:19.561
Um, yeah, it was...

00:19.978 --> 00:22.313
I actually remember,
it was a really nice day.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.190
[mysterious music builds up]

00:24.274 --> 00:26.276
[girl] It had been rainy
and cold all week.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.069
I didn't know was going to be
so much warmer,

00:28.153 --> 00:29.404
so I wore tights.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.198
I really wish I hadn't.

00:35.952 --> 00:38.371
[nun] It was really just a normal day.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.499
I don't know how else to describe it.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.626
[door creaks]

00:43.710 --> 00:45.503
[Joe] I started the day on traffic duty.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.756
[bus hisses]

00:48.214 --> 00:50.633
Mrs. Worthy tried to drop Brian off
in the bus lane again,

00:50.717 --> 00:51.968
but other than that,

00:52.677 --> 00:54.220
there was nothing out of the ordinary.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.140
Then in second period,
there was a scheduled fire drill.

00:57.932 --> 01:01.019
We do those, like, twice a year,
so I didn't really think anything of it.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.145
[fire alarm blares]

01:02.228 --> 01:04.856
I got to miss a math test,
so I was pretty happy about that.

01:04.939 --> 01:06.316
[bell ringing]

01:06.399 --> 01:08.318
[girl #2] I had first lunch that day.

01:08.401 --> 01:11.154
I got there earlier than usual
'cause it was Chicken Finger Monday.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.490
[girl #3] Chicken Finger Monday.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.575
[Lil K] Those things are damn good.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.452
[nun] Chicken fingers are very popular.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.829
They're actually pretty solid
chicken fingers.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.832
They're not restaurant quality,
but they're better than what you'd think.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.584
[girl #4] I had a salad that day.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.087
I think, a cookie and lemonade.

01:27.170 --> 01:30.048
I had the chicken fingers for lunch
with potatoes and lemonade.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.175
[various students]
Chicken fingers, chips, lemonade--

01:32.258 --> 01:33.927
-Spaghetti and lemonade--
-Pasta, lemonade--

01:34.010 --> 01:35.136
A cookie, a lemonade--

01:35.220 --> 01:36.971
-I got the spaghetti and lemonade.
-Lemonade.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.431
-...and lemonade.
-Pasta, lemonade.

01:38.515 --> 01:39.641
-...and lemonade.
-Lemonade.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.601
-Lemonade.
-I had the lemonade.

01:41.684 --> 01:43.686
[mysterious music resolves]

01:45.772 --> 01:48.483
[Mascot Boy] So I was talking
to Noah McCusker about something and...

01:48.566 --> 01:49.651
and he just stops.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.152
Mid-sentence.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.571
I'll never forget the look on his face.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.118
It was like time stopped for a second.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.495
[chair creaks]

02:00.578 --> 02:03.123
A couple of students
just started rushing away

02:03.206 --> 02:04.999
and I didn't even know it was going on.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.044
[boy] It took me a minute to process.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.297
It didn't really hit me right away.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.507
[indistinct chatter]

02:12.590 --> 02:13.716
And then it really hit me.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.094
[banging on door]

02:16.177 --> 02:17.262
I had to shit.

02:17.345 --> 02:20.056
[screaming, farting]

02:20.140 --> 02:23.184
And I looked around me
and everyone else had to shit too.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.312
[nun] All of a sudden,
kids aren't making it into the bathroom,

02:26.396 --> 02:29.941
because our our bathrooms weren't designed
for that many people.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.569
[boy] It was just a race
to the closest toilet.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.320
[girl] So I was already in the stalls.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.031
Immediately after,
people just started, like,

02:37.115 --> 02:38.700
swarming in.

02:38.783 --> 02:40.160
I couldn't even get out.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.995
[girl #2]
It wasn't a line to the bathroom.

02:42.078 --> 02:44.622
Seriously! Hurry up! Are you done yet?

02:44.706 --> 02:45.999
It was a pile.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.919
[girl #3] I realized there was no way
I was gonna make it to the bathroom,

02:50.044 --> 02:51.963
so I grabbed a trash can.

02:52.672 --> 02:56.009
People were just trying to find a place
where they could put their shit.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.093
[girl #4] I was desperate.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.137
I just pooped on the floor.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.182
People were shitting in urinals and sinks.
It was crazy.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.893
[Joe] I've been at St. Bernardine
for a long time.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.686
I can tell you,

03:07.020 --> 03:09.731
this was the worst thing
I've seen at this school in 20 years.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.776
-[phone line trilling]
-9-1-1, what's your emergency?

03:13.860 --> 03:15.695
[girl] I'm calling
from St. Bernardine Catholic.

03:15.778 --> 03:19.073
-[dispatcher] Yes, ma'am?
-Our students... I don't know how to say.

03:19.157 --> 03:22.285
They're all sick, they're all...
They're all pooping.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.120
It happened around lunchtime.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.373
It was just a few students
and then all of them started running--

03:27.707 --> 03:28.917
I wanted to die.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.585
We had no choice.

03:30.668 --> 03:34.130
I mean, most of us just shit our pants
right in front of everyone.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.090
[Joe] I realized right away

03:36.174 --> 03:38.051
this wasn't the work
of spoiled fish sticks.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.470
This was an attack.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.388
[screaming]

03:42.472 --> 03:44.474
[girl] Before it was all over,
it had a name.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.267
"The Brownout."

03:46.517 --> 03:49.270
The Brownout was the worst day of my life.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.273
Mrs. Wexler, the Dean of Students,
canceled all remaining classes.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.859
-Oh, my God.
-[Lil K] So after lunch,

03:54.943 --> 03:57.237
they call school off
for the whole rest of the day.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.030
My parents came to pick me up,

03:59.280 --> 04:00.490
I go home,

04:01.115 --> 04:02.492
I take a long shower,

04:02.992 --> 04:06.579
and I look at my phone
and I see this notification.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.497
[chime]

04:07.580 --> 04:09.749
I got tagged in a video
by the Turd Burglar.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.501
[girl #2] The Turd Burglar...

04:11.584 --> 04:12.877
I got tagged in a video.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.921
I didn't know who it was,

04:15.004 --> 04:18.675
but he knew just about everybody
that shit themselves that day.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.510
He was taunting us with his captions.

04:20.593 --> 04:24.055
"Milk, milk, lemonade,
around the corner...

04:24.138 --> 04:25.223
poo emoji is made."

04:26.182 --> 04:28.059
[Carla] At this point it's clear

04:28.142 --> 04:30.853
it wasn't an accident,
because someone's claiming credit.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.356
[girl #3] Honestly I didn't know
a single person

04:33.439 --> 04:35.692
who wasn't following
the Turd Burglar after that.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.112
He got, like, 800 followers in one day.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.447
There was no name, no face.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.741
Just a bunch of pictures of poop
and the Brownout.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.119
[girl] A bunch of us tried to message him,
but he never DM'd

04:46.202 --> 04:47.954
or followed anyone back.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.540
[Carla] He posted a picture
of the lemonade dispenser.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.168
What caught my eye right away
was this card,

04:54.669 --> 04:56.087
@theturdburglar,

04:56.170 --> 04:58.464
and right away I thought, "Here we go."

04:58.548 --> 05:00.425
We got something really serious going on.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.093
This guy wanted an audience.

05:03.511 --> 05:07.307
[girl] For the next two weeks,
all anybody could talk about was...

05:11.477 --> 05:12.854
"Who is the Turd Burglar?"

05:14.105 --> 05:15.940
[intro music playing]

05:52.852 --> 05:54.562
[Peter] In April of 2016,

05:54.645 --> 05:57.023
Sam Ecklund and I began shooting
American Vandal,

05:57.106 --> 05:59.192
in hopes of getting Hanover High School's
school board

05:59.275 --> 06:01.361
to reexamine the case of Dylan Maxwell,

06:01.861 --> 06:04.280
a high school senior
accused of drawing dicks,

06:04.364 --> 06:05.740
a crime he didn't commit.

06:06.574 --> 06:07.492
And it worked.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.496
But we never anticipated
the reaction from the rest of the world.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.999
Vimeo made it a Staff Pick,
and before we knew it,

06:15.083 --> 06:17.001
it got hundreds of thousands of views.

06:17.585 --> 06:18.711
And then,

06:18.795 --> 06:19.962
we got an email.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.673
At first, I thought it was Sam
messing with me,

06:22.882 --> 06:24.175
but it was real

06:24.550 --> 06:25.885
and it was from Netflix.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.513
Netflix allowed us to reach
a wider audience

06:28.596 --> 06:30.765
and to add some additional
production value,

06:30.848 --> 06:35.019
like drone shots, an original score,
opening credits,

06:35.103 --> 06:36.521
and 3D graphics.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.898
It brought new life to our documentary,

06:39.482 --> 06:41.567
even though many the fans
thought the changes robbed it

06:41.651 --> 06:43.903
of some of the Vimeo version's
original charm.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.656
Since season one was released on Netflix,

06:46.906 --> 06:48.533
the response has been incredible.

06:48.616 --> 06:51.661
Please welcome Peter Maldonado
and Sam Ecklund.

06:51.744 --> 06:55.581
[Peter] It put us on the national stage
in a way we could have never anticipated.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.918
The biggest question
facing this country right now...

06:59.502 --> 07:01.838
-who drew the dicks?
-[Peter and Sam chuckle]

07:02.463 --> 07:04.424
[Peter] I'm telling you all this
for context.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.260
Because with all this attention
came a lot of pressure,

07:07.677 --> 07:10.888
and a lot of opinions on what kind
of a case to take on next.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.391
There was a staggering number of people

07:13.474 --> 07:16.727
who contacted us about their schools'
dick-drawing controversies.

07:16.853 --> 07:17.728
For example,

07:17.812 --> 07:21.315
someone burnt a dick into the 50-yard line
of their school's football field.

07:21.441 --> 07:25.278
I'm not sure if it was weed killer
or, you know, lighter fluid,

07:25.486 --> 07:27.405
but we had to re-sod the whole field.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.700
[Peter] Then there was a spray-painting
vagina vandal in Texas,

07:30.783 --> 07:33.786
a serial pool-pisser
in a high school in Wisconsin,

07:33.870 --> 07:36.581
a Navy pilot who drew a dick in the sky,

07:36.664 --> 07:37.748
and a real murder,

07:37.832 --> 07:40.710
that for some reason someone thought
Sam and I should figure out.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.004
But with the exception of that murder,

07:43.087 --> 07:45.590
nothing seemed worth
a deeper investigation,

07:45.673 --> 07:48.217
until I was contacted by Chloe Lyman.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.135
Hi, Peter.

07:49.218 --> 07:52.513
My name is Chloe Lyman and I'm a junior
at St. Bernardine Catholic.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.308
I'm contacting you today
because we have a vandal.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.351
He goes by the name "The Turd Burglar."

07:57.435 --> 07:59.020
[Peter] This one really grabbed me.

07:59.103 --> 08:02.398
The Hanover High dicks were a financial
headache for some teachers,

08:02.482 --> 08:05.401
but what happened at St. Bernardine
was a different animal.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.905
The Turd Burglar,
an anonymous digital entity,

08:08.988 --> 08:12.408
was waging psychological warfare
on the students and teachers

08:12.492 --> 08:15.077
of one of the most affluent high schools
in the country.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.664
A school whose alumni donors
include two billionaires and a senator.

08:19.290 --> 08:22.376
A school with a nationally ranked
basketball program.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.046
A school that, according to Chloe Lyman,

08:25.129 --> 08:27.256
cared about its reputation above all else.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.800
Because, I'm telling you,
this school has secrets,

08:29.884 --> 08:31.594
secrets that go all the way up to the top.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.805
So after giving a presentation
to our teachers at Hanover High,

08:34.889 --> 08:37.725
Sam and I were approved to make
the Turd Burglar investigation

08:37.808 --> 08:39.227
our senior project.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.020
In December of 2017,

08:41.312 --> 08:43.272
we headed up to Bellevue, Washington

08:43.356 --> 08:45.816
with a small crew and brand new equipment.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.361
Chloe's parents let Sam and I
stay at their house.

08:48.778 --> 08:49.695
Hi.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.531
-Oh my God, hi.
-Hey.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.533
-Thanks for letting us stay.
-Nice to meet you.

08:54.075 --> 08:57.245
She seemed to know a lot about
the mystery surrounding the Turd Burglar,

08:57.328 --> 08:59.247
so I thought it was a good idea
to stay with her.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.374
Also, her house is sick.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.002
Don't drop it.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.849
Twelve hundred miles north of Oceanside,

09:19.183 --> 09:22.270
we found ourselves
in a completely new world,

09:22.520 --> 09:23.980
at the scene of the crime:

09:24.063 --> 09:26.440
St. Bernardine Catholic High School.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.483
This is beautiful.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.611
[Chloe] This is the east gym.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.530
[Peter blows raspberries]

09:33.447 --> 09:36.617
You guys really aren't messing around
when it comes to basketball, are you?

09:36.701 --> 09:37.785
Kind of a lot.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.288
[Peter] St. Bernardine is a school
with great pride,

09:40.955 --> 09:42.707
so it's no wonder the Turd Burglar

09:42.790 --> 09:44.875
was able to terrorize
the entire community.

09:44.959 --> 09:48.004
Well, Jim, police are still very active
on scene here.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.590
They're just trying to get whatever
information they can.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.634
Since Monday, the police
are turning their attention to Instagram

09:53.718 --> 09:55.177
and their parent company Facebook...

09:55.261 --> 09:57.179
...an anonymous account, @theturdburglar,

09:57.263 --> 09:58.848
is taking credit for the crime.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.809
Bellevue Police Department
have released a joint statement

10:01.892 --> 10:05.646
"The acts of the Turd Burglar
are unacceptable."

10:05.730 --> 10:08.190
After the Brownout, everyone was on edge.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.401
All these kids didn't show up
to school the next day.

10:10.484 --> 10:13.404
Were these parents pulling these kids out
or were they still shitting?

10:13.487 --> 10:15.823
[girl] Nobody wanted
to make eye contact after that.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.826
It was really hard to do
after you saw everybody else shit.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.911
[boy] Turd Burglar kept threatening
to hit us again,

10:21.245 --> 10:22.246
but no one knew how.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.040
Anytime I smelled anything rotten,

10:24.415 --> 10:26.208
heard anything that sounded like a fart,

10:26.292 --> 10:28.836
I would instantly think
of the quickest route to the bathroom.

10:28.919 --> 10:31.589
My phone was ringing off the hook
from concerned parents

10:31.672 --> 10:33.799
who were threatening
to pull their kids out of school.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.801
The administration was coming up empty,

10:35.885 --> 10:38.095
and we just couldn't sit there
doing nothing.

10:38.179 --> 10:41.807
I promise you, we are taking the incident
extremely seriously.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.143
I have a daughter who has hemorrhoids.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.144
I have a question.

10:45.227 --> 10:49.148
Do you know how hard it is to clean poo
out of a monogrammed sweater?

10:49.231 --> 10:52.360
Do you know how expensive it is
to try to get poo out of a sweater?

10:52.443 --> 10:55.529
You'll make a receipt that I can turn in
to the insurance company.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.614
A receipt?

10:56.697 --> 11:00.743
Well, a week after the incident,
we were still grasping at straws.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.995
-[door opens]
-Hi.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.664
[Joe] So we decided to open it up

11:04.747 --> 11:07.041
and interview every student at the school.

11:07.124 --> 11:09.710
We followed every potential lead.
You have to.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.921
[Carla] So, a few students came to us,

11:12.463 --> 11:17.301
telling us that Savannah Hagedorn
was a big fan of the school lemonade,

11:17.385 --> 11:19.011
so much so that she... [chuckles]

11:19.095 --> 11:21.764
She often had three lemonades
at a single lunch sitting.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.057
Have a seat.

11:23.808 --> 11:28.312
Why would she choose that one day
to bring a Capri Sun for lunch?

11:28.771 --> 11:33.192
It turns out Savannah didn't even like
the regular, yellow cafeteria lemonade.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.945
She drinks the pink lemonade
from the vending machine.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.322
I didn't realize there was some
in the vending machines too.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.240
Yeah, okay.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.033
So that lead was nothing.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.496
I'm pretty sure this was Jared Wilkinson.

11:45.579 --> 11:48.332
Why is that, that you think it's Jared?

11:48.416 --> 11:50.251
He's kind of into scat porn...

11:50.710 --> 11:51.669
type stuff.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.671
Then we looked in the Jared Wilkinson.

11:54.046 --> 11:57.883
His classmates told us
he was really into certain videos.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.302
-[woman moaning]
-[Joe] He watches it a lot?

12:00.386 --> 12:02.430
[Cameron] Yeah, kind of at school.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.224
Sex with... with feces?

12:05.599 --> 12:07.017
Sex with it, or...?

12:07.143 --> 12:09.603
How is the poop involved
in the videos, do you know?

12:09.687 --> 12:12.481
No, I wasn't there for the Brownout. Um...

12:12.565 --> 12:14.233
I was out. I had a doctor's appointment.

12:14.316 --> 12:15.568
He had a completely solid alibi.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.862
Turns out he wasn't even
in school that day.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.573
So, another lead that went nowhere.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.159
[Carla] We heard dozens of stories,

12:23.451 --> 12:25.995
and students were coming to us
with guesses

12:26.078 --> 12:28.122
and accusations that went nowhere.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.625
[Joe] Parents were pulling their students
from school.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.419
The media had a field day.

12:33.961 --> 12:36.213
We were 16 days into our investigation

12:36.297 --> 12:37.840
and we still had nothing.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.633
[hinge creaks]

12:39.717 --> 12:41.886
That's when Tanner Bassett came to us.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.561
[Carla] State your name, please.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.314
It's Tanner Bassett.

12:55.399 --> 12:57.067
[Joe] What do you want to tell us?

12:57.943 --> 12:59.945
I think I know who the Turd Burglar is.

13:02.865 --> 13:03.991
It's Kevin McClain.

13:04.909 --> 13:08.746
Tanner says that the Turd Burglar
is his friend Kevin McClain,

13:08.829 --> 13:11.707
and you could tell
that it was weighing on Tanner.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.627
And that the guilt was building up.

13:15.252 --> 13:18.422
And he says that he believes
that Kevin's going to strike again.

13:18.756 --> 13:19.632
So,

13:19.840 --> 13:21.592
he does the right thing and he...

13:22.426 --> 13:23.260
he turns him in.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.515
[Lil K] Kevin's kind of weird.
But, like, a lot of kids are weird here.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.476
What made it legit is that it was Tanner
who called him out.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.103
Tanner and Kevin,
they're, like, inseparable.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.148
[Joe] This wasn't just a blind accusation.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.984
This was coming from Kevin's best friend.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.445
[Carla] How long have you known Kevin?

13:42.196 --> 13:44.156
[Tanner] Uh, since kindergarten.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.784
He lived in the house
diagonally across from me.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.496
[Carla] Fair to say
that you know him very well?

13:50.579 --> 13:52.289
[Tanner] Yeah,
probably better than anybody.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.999
We carpool together, we're in...

13:54.834 --> 13:57.753
Uh, we were in a band together.
You know, played music.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.922
[Lil K] I think their band was called
the Horsehead,

14:00.005 --> 14:01.966
or the Horsehead Collective or something.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.926
Their music was kind of experimental.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.303
We're gonna play
one of our originals, uh...

14:06.387 --> 14:07.680
"Digital Refrigerator."

14:09.723 --> 14:11.684
[girl] So when I was in the eighth grade,

14:11.767 --> 14:14.019
I thought they were so good
and they were so cool.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.438
Yeah, back in middle school,
I kinda liked them.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.815
[lousy electronic music playing]

14:17.898 --> 14:20.860
But now I realize they're awful.

14:20.943 --> 14:24.071
♪ Sorry, wrong number, time to die ♪

14:24.154 --> 14:25.573
[bass drop]

14:26.448 --> 14:29.952
[boy] They DJ'd a middle school dance
and they played one of their songs.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.912
It was the worst song
I've ever heard in my life.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.498
[Joe] It made sense why the kids
bullied them about the music.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.000
Uh, it was garbage.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.127
Tanner, would you say, uh...

14:38.210 --> 14:40.880
that Kevin is, you know, bullied?

14:41.547 --> 14:43.883
Kids will often laugh at him

14:44.341 --> 14:45.968
rather than with him sometimes.

14:46.051 --> 14:50.180
In a situation where a student
lashes out at his school,

14:50.347 --> 14:53.017
especially this case where there's
so much planning involved,

14:53.559 --> 14:56.562
we're looking for a student
that's alienated

14:56.645 --> 14:57.938
by the rest of the school.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.357
Kevin fits this profile to a T.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.067
It's tougher to spot bullying these days.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.903
You know, it's much more subtle.

15:03.986 --> 15:06.488

But now these kids are going
right up to him with a phone

15:11.702 --> 15:13.412
throwing fruit at him and he,

15:13.495 --> 15:15.497
you know, tries to fight it off.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.918
And then they'll post that video,
share it around, comment,

tease him behind his back.

Matt Hahn made this blog
called Shit Kevin Says.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.308
[Matt] I got the idea
when Kevin started posting reviews

15:34.391 --> 15:35.893
of teas from around the world.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.729
I was like, "More kids need to see this."

You want to be sure

15:40.022 --> 15:43.609
to suck in quite a bit of air as you taste

[slurping]

15:51.075 --> 15:51.951
[girl] So, Kevin,

15:52.534 --> 15:54.244
he's like one of those guys
who's constantly

15:54.328 --> 15:55.746
doing an impression of a smart guy.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.539
Truly a delight.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.916
[Joe] It's really cruel stuff.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.876
The kids share his webcam videos,

16:01.251 --> 16:03.170
dress as him for Halloween.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.880
They post all the pictures online.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.715
It's as clear as day.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.008
He's bullied.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.677
In my experience,

16:09.802 --> 16:10.803
what Kevin went through

16:10.886 --> 16:12.513
is exactly the kind of bullying

16:12.596 --> 16:14.556
that would push an adolescent
over the edge.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.727
[Carla] Did he tell you
that he poisoned the lemonade?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.354
No, he didn't tell me,

16:20.437 --> 16:21.897
but I know he did it.

16:22.773 --> 16:23.649
[Carla] How?

16:23.732 --> 16:26.318
[Tanner] Well, I was with him
that whole lunch,

16:26.402 --> 16:29.363
and we bought our lunch together
like we always do.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.615
And normally we'd go
right from the cashier

16:31.699 --> 16:33.158
straight to our table,

16:33.242 --> 16:37.162
but that day he goes all the way
around the edge of the cafeteria,

16:37.246 --> 16:38.455
which I thought was odd

16:38.539 --> 16:40.374
'cause he's really particular
about his routine.

16:40.457 --> 16:43.377
Then I saw him bump into Brother Buckley

16:43.460 --> 16:44.670
and spill his lemonade.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.964
I couldn't really hear what was going on,

16:47.047 --> 16:51.176
but it seemed like Kevin was apologizing
for not looking where he was going.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.470
But it didn't look like an accident to me.

16:53.554 --> 16:54.596
You think Kevin...

16:55.764 --> 16:57.891
bumped into Brother Buckley intentionally?

16:58.559 --> 17:00.436
-Yeah.
-Why?

17:01.186 --> 17:02.438
Because Brother Buckley's old.

17:02.980 --> 17:06.608
Like, old people die on the toilet
all the time,

17:06.692 --> 17:10.487
and everybody knows that Brother Buckley's
been having health issues, so...

17:10.863 --> 17:13.240
[chuckles] What was going
to prevent Brother Buckley

17:13.323 --> 17:15.784
-from just getting another lemonade?
-Well, because...

17:17.244 --> 17:18.746
Kevin replaced it for him.

17:19.079 --> 17:19.955
He did?

17:20.039 --> 17:22.708
But he didn't get the lemonade,
he got the...

17:23.083 --> 17:24.501
he got the horchata.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.672
And Kevin said that the horchata
is better than lemonade,

17:29.006 --> 17:33.677
and that he wanted to get Buckley a treat

17:33.761 --> 17:36.555
because he felt bad,
but, I mean, I thought that was weird.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.348
[thud echoes]

17:38.432 --> 17:40.225
[Joe] The horchata was a big deal to us.

17:40.934 --> 17:43.270
Why buy a horchata to replace a lemonade?

17:43.353 --> 17:45.022
It's $1.25 more.

17:45.647 --> 17:48.400
And who knows if Brother Buckley
even liked horchata?

17:48.484 --> 17:50.736
A lot of people don't. I don't.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.529
Cinnamon and milk?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.073
[inhales]

17:54.531 --> 17:56.617
As soon as Tanner told us
about the horchata,

17:56.700 --> 17:58.160
we knew we were onto something.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.411
Did he seem nervous?

17:59.495 --> 18:02.081
-Did he seem like he was hiding anything?
-Definitely.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.124
I mean, all that day,

18:04.208 --> 18:05.793
before the Brownout.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.253
Um, even the night before.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.631
That's when I noticed it,
is when we went to Dawsey's.

18:11.632 --> 18:12.758
He was driving me home,

18:12.841 --> 18:15.552
and we decided to go to Dawsey's
like we usually do.

18:15.969 --> 18:18.472
And the free samples guy,

18:19.139 --> 18:21.266
he gives us unlimited samples,

18:21.350 --> 18:23.227
but he has no idea that he's doing it.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.520
So Kevin came up with this:

18:24.603 --> 18:26.647
So we'd go up to him and say,
"Hey, man..."

18:26.730 --> 18:28.524
-[Kevin] May I?
-"...can I have a meatball?"

18:28.607 --> 18:31.026
And the guy would say,
"Yeah, sure. Have a meatball."

18:31.110 --> 18:33.112
Then Kevin would go around the aisle

18:33.195 --> 18:35.823
and he'd come back and do some voice.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.199
He'd go, "Hello.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.327
Can I have a meatball?"
And the guy would be like,

18:40.410 --> 18:41.995
"Oh, sure. Have a meatball."

18:42.287 --> 18:43.789
And he has no idea.

18:43.872 --> 18:46.291
One time Kevin ate eight meatballs.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.043
[Kevin] Delectable! Thank you!

18:48.127 --> 18:49.962
[Tanner] That's just what we'd do
at Dawsey's.

18:50.045 --> 18:53.632
[stuttering] We'd dupe this guy
into giving us however many samples.

18:53.715 --> 18:57.928
So-- So we get to Dawsey's,
and that's what I think we're gonna do,

18:58.011 --> 18:59.888
just get some free samples.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.266
I walk to the sample station,

19:02.599 --> 19:05.686
and I realized Kevin's not following me.

19:06.019 --> 19:09.398
I don't know where he went. So it's weird.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.527
I got some pigs in a blanket, but..

19:13.610 --> 19:17.614
Kevin's buying something else.
And I just see him walking out of Dawsey's

19:17.698 --> 19:19.324
with a big bag.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.118
-[Joe] Of samples?
-[Tanner] A huge-- No.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.704
A huge bag filled with something,
I don't know what's in there.

19:23.787 --> 19:26.707
[Carla] What did you think was in there?
-[Tanner] Well, I asked him.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.625
He said, "Nothing." He seemed nervous.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.003
So it was probably the laxatives.

19:31.086 --> 19:34.798
Kevin makes a substantial purchase
at Dawsey's,

19:34.882 --> 19:38.427
and your best friend asks you,
"What's in the bag?"

19:38.844 --> 19:40.387
and you refuse to tell him.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.973
Did you see him bring the Dawsey's bag
to school the next day?

19:43.056 --> 19:44.391
No, it's just...

19:45.475 --> 19:47.644
But he could've hid it
in his backpack, right?

19:51.857 --> 19:54.693
Anything else you can remember
from the day of the Brownout?

19:54.776 --> 19:58.113
Anything that was sort of unusual
or out of the ordinary--?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.198
[Tanner] Yeah, just...

20:00.574 --> 20:03.202
Remember I was telling you
that we always sit at the same table?

20:04.244 --> 20:05.495
Well, that day...

20:06.955 --> 20:08.624
Kevin chose a different lunch table.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.544
[girl] Very early into that lunch,
I knew something was off.

20:13.253 --> 20:17.216
I just noticed some people weren't
where they were supposed to be.

20:17.299 --> 20:21.970
So, I remember seeing Shaun Sacoda
sitting next to Declan Maniscalo,

20:22.054 --> 20:23.096
and the lacrosse guys,

20:23.180 --> 20:24.973
the one with the "Runner Boy"
at the end of it,

20:25.057 --> 20:29.353
which is weird, because Sean usually sits
with Nick Sondergoth and those guys.

20:29.436 --> 20:30.604
Usually Declan does, too.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.690
So then I look to Nick, and I realize

20:33.774 --> 20:36.360
that Dec and Sacoda
aren't sitting with Nick Sondergoth

20:36.443 --> 20:38.445
or Lissa Brasington and Monty Calamaway,

20:38.528 --> 20:39.988
because sitting next to Nick

20:40.072 --> 20:42.115
is Tanner Bassett and Kevin McClain.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.201
And I don't think it was random.

20:44.868 --> 20:45.702
Why?

20:45.786 --> 20:48.830
Because he was sitting across
from Nick Sondergoth.

20:49.957 --> 20:50.832
[Carla] Okay.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.835
I'm sorry, who is Nick Sondergoth?

20:53.919 --> 20:56.255
Nick is somebody that Kevin's hated
since the sixth grade.

20:56.880 --> 20:57.714
Why?

20:58.298 --> 21:00.342
[Tanner] Because he ruined Kevin's life.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.596
[Chloe] Kevin was just the nicest kid.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.641
I moved to Bellevue
when I was in the fourth grade,

21:07.724 --> 21:10.644
so I didn't know anybody
and I was really shy.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.563
So I was really lucky to find Kevin.

21:14.022 --> 21:15.983
And I know it sounds weird to say

21:16.066 --> 21:18.652
that someone was popular in fourth grade,

21:18.735 --> 21:20.696
but Kevin was just...

21:21.363 --> 21:23.490
kind of a kid that everyone really liked.

21:23.573 --> 21:25.117
[girl] Kevin wasn't always weird.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.494
Back then he was just a normal kid.

21:27.577 --> 21:29.705
It just really sucks what happened to him.

21:32.332 --> 21:35.502
[Greg] Before St. Bernie, a lot of kids
went to St. Damascus Elementary.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.422
[Jen] I was in that gym class with Kevin.

21:38.505 --> 21:39.840
I remember it pretty clearly.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.050
Back then, we all wore
the same gym shorts.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.510
They were light blue.

21:43.593 --> 21:46.638
The kind that would easily get
a grass stain or a dirt mark.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.057
Kevin sucked at Capture the Flag,

21:49.141 --> 21:51.810
so he gets tagged out, like, immediately.

21:52.936 --> 21:54.354
[Allison] Kevin's sitting in jail

21:54.438 --> 21:56.148
and someone made a jailbreak.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.191
I think was Adam Kimbrough.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.611
He tags Kevin free and Kevin gets up.

22:02.446 --> 22:05.198
He's got this stain on his shorts,

22:05.657 --> 22:06.783
right on his butt.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.494
Kevin said was dirt,
but nobody was buying it.

22:10.078 --> 22:12.289
It really looked like he shit his pants.

22:13.457 --> 22:16.168
[Ryan] It was funny,
but that was kind of it.

22:16.668 --> 22:19.171
Gym class ended
and everyone forgot about it.

22:19.588 --> 22:20.672
Until the next morning.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.633
[Jen] Apparently, Nick Sondergoth
took a picture of Kevin

22:23.717 --> 22:26.261
while we were in gym class
and posted it the next day.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.055
The caption for that picture

22:28.555 --> 22:30.140
was "Shit Stain McClain."

22:30.223 --> 22:33.060
He became Shit Stain McClain.

22:35.062 --> 22:36.688
I mean, kids can be really cruel.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.774
[boy] Hey, Shit Stain McClain!

22:40.067 --> 22:41.068
[Allison] That name,

22:41.526 --> 22:42.944
"Shit Stain McClain,"

22:43.570 --> 22:46.323
it destroyed Kevin.
It was really bad for him.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.117
And it was huge for Nick Sondergoth.

22:50.452 --> 22:53.246
Kevin was cool.
Like, he had friends before that.

22:53.997 --> 22:56.875
[Greg] He went from a 35-person
birthday party in the fifth grade...

22:56.958 --> 22:59.086
[all shyly] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

22:59.169 --> 23:02.506
...to, like, a three-person birthday party
in the sixth.

23:02.589 --> 23:04.925
After that, he created this
sort of persona

23:05.008 --> 23:07.677
where he had to be the smartest person
in the room all the time.

23:07.969 --> 23:11.223
There was a month in 8th grade
where he just spoke in a British accent

23:11.306 --> 23:12.349
for no reason.

23:12.432 --> 23:13.892
[Joe] I felt sorry for the kid.

23:14.684 --> 23:17.896
You know, imagine going through
all those years of bullying

23:19.398 --> 23:20.982
just because of one mistake.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.403
[suspenseful music playing]

23:45.882 --> 23:47.551
[door hinge creaks]

23:51.054 --> 23:52.556
Kevin. Have a seat.

23:55.475 --> 23:56.518
Much obliged.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.779
[clock ticking]

24:10.949 --> 24:12.868
[Carla] Monday, November 6th.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.745
Do you remember what happened on that day?

24:19.124 --> 24:20.041
Kevin...

24:20.125 --> 24:23.211
I'm sorry,
I thought that was a rhetorical question.

24:24.754 --> 24:25.714
Let's just say,

24:26.256 --> 24:27.632
for the rest of this interview,

24:27.716 --> 24:30.051
there will be no rhetorical questions,
okay?

24:31.845 --> 24:33.013
Was that a question?

24:33.847 --> 24:36.892
Kevin's got a wall up,
which is totally normal for...

24:37.559 --> 24:40.937
for an adolescent, uh,
especially one with deep-seated issues.

24:41.021 --> 24:44.357
Can you please tell me why you think
we called you down here today?

24:45.567 --> 24:47.944
Well, I assume
it must have something to do

24:48.028 --> 24:50.238
with this turd burglarizing.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.450
No one comes right out and confesses.
That's just not how it works.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.076
Unfortunately, I know nothing,

24:55.160 --> 24:58.622
nor do I understand the juvenile nature
of these crimes.

24:59.581 --> 25:00.916
[Carla] November 6th.

25:01.124 --> 25:02.792
What were you doing during that lunch?

25:04.044 --> 25:07.756
Would it surprise you if I said
that during lunch,

25:07.839 --> 25:10.300
I was at lunch?

25:10.383 --> 25:12.219
He's not just gonna admit it,

25:12.886 --> 25:16.014
so we know it's all about
how we present the evidence.

25:16.097 --> 25:19.059
For hours, he was giving us nothing
but confusing answers.

25:19.142 --> 25:21.019
Because I didn't. Declarative.

25:21.436 --> 25:23.396
Period. Sentence dot.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.940
I don't recall,

25:25.315 --> 25:27.609
recollect, remember.

25:27.692 --> 25:30.153
Where were you
when the fire drill went off?

25:30.237 --> 25:32.489
But when we asked him where he was
during the fire drill,

25:33.031 --> 25:34.282
he immediately replies...

25:34.366 --> 25:38.537
I was on the baseball field
in my designated safety zone.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.663
[Joe] "The baseball field."

25:40.872 --> 25:43.375
He knew he had to be accounted for
during the fire alarm.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.794
[Carla] All the food and beverages
are kept in this room

25:45.877 --> 25:47.629
behind the kitchen cafeteria,

25:47.712 --> 25:50.966
and if you sneak through the back door,
it's going to set off a buzzer alarm.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.593
The only thing that's going to be
louder than a buzzer alarm

25:53.927 --> 25:55.303
is a fire alarm.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.472
To us it was clear
that during the fire alarm,

25:57.556 --> 25:59.558
that's when Kevin put the laxatives
in the lemonade.

25:59.849 --> 26:01.851
So, let's talk about the laxatives.

26:02.185 --> 26:03.520
The night of November 5th,

26:03.687 --> 26:04.771
you went to Dawsey's.

26:04.854 --> 26:08.567
Listen, I had no reason to go to Dawsey's.

26:10.068 --> 26:12.112
That's not what your best friend said.

26:12.821 --> 26:15.282
-And who might that be?
-Tanner Bassett.

26:18.493 --> 26:19.828
He told us everything.

26:21.288 --> 26:24.416
[Joe] You changed seats, Kevin. Why?

26:24.499 --> 26:27.210
I don't know. For a change of scenery?

26:28.420 --> 26:32.132
A change of scenery that brings you
next to Nick Sondergoth?

26:32.841 --> 26:35.302
Yes, next to Nick Sondergoth.

26:35.927 --> 26:38.847
And did you enjoy watching Nick Sondergoth
poop his pants?

26:39.055 --> 26:41.850
Kevin, let's go back
to Shit Stain McClain.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.728
Did you like that nickname?

26:46.104 --> 26:46.938
No.

26:47.022 --> 26:49.482
Because you've been hearing it
since sixth grade.

26:50.275 --> 26:53.069
"Shit Stain McClain."

26:53.153 --> 26:56.364
-[clock ticks]
-[Carla] The school is pressing charges,

26:56.448 --> 26:59.993
but I can tell you that the judge
is going to be a lot more lenient

27:00.327 --> 27:01.703
if you're honest with us.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.748
What you have to remember
is that we're dealing with a 17-year-old.

27:04.831 --> 27:05.707
He's a kid.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.084
We'll tell the judge that.
We'll tell him you just...

27:08.752 --> 27:12.130
you know, got bullied
and you were trying to get back at those

27:12.213 --> 27:15.133
that we're treating you unfairly,
it just got a little out of hand.

27:15.216 --> 27:17.385
Of course, he's gonna get emotional
about all of this,

27:17.469 --> 27:19.721
but he finally has to face the truth.

27:19.804 --> 27:22.182
Kevin, here's the thing.
We know you did it.

27:22.557 --> 27:25.101
There's a mountain of evidence
against him.

27:25.185 --> 27:26.519
You got the horchata,

27:26.978 --> 27:30.190
you've got the going to Dawsey's
the night before,

27:30.607 --> 27:33.401
and Throwback Thursday Shit Stain McClain.

27:33.943 --> 27:35.945
So, we gave him a break

27:36.029 --> 27:37.614
to collect himself,

27:37.697 --> 27:39.908
he came back in the room
and he started talking.

27:41.826 --> 27:45.205
-[Kevin] What do you want me to say?
-We want you to tell us the truth, Kevin.

27:48.833 --> 27:52.003
You spilled Brother Buckley's lemonade
on purpose,

27:52.087 --> 27:53.004
didn't you?

27:57.842 --> 27:59.719
-Yeah.
-[Carla] Why?

28:00.345 --> 28:04.140
Because I didn't want him to poop himself.

28:04.974 --> 28:07.519
I didn't think his body could take it.

28:08.019 --> 28:10.814
Because you knew the lemonade was tainted.

28:12.357 --> 28:13.566
[sighs] Yes.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.860
[Carla] And how did you know
the lemonade was tainted?

28:16.236 --> 28:18.446
I was the one who did it.

28:19.155 --> 28:20.073
Because...

28:20.657 --> 28:22.701
you put the laxatives in the lemonade.

28:24.035 --> 28:24.869
Yeah.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.165
And what else did you do?

28:33.712 --> 28:34.629
I...

28:35.422 --> 28:36.923
did the thing...

28:37.006 --> 28:38.341
at the pep rally.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.385
And...

28:42.345 --> 28:45.432
And the thing in Ms. Montgomery's class.

28:48.518 --> 28:49.477
Kevin,

28:50.520 --> 28:52.439
are you the Turd Burglar?

28:55.734 --> 28:56.860
[sighs]

28:57.652 --> 28:58.486
Yes.

29:06.369 --> 29:08.288
[slurps]

29:09.372 --> 29:11.458
[Peter] Kevin McClain confessed.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.668
And not just to the Brownout.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.504
I mean, the Brownout was bad,
but then he hit us again.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.339
[screaming]

29:18.423 --> 29:19.424
And again.

29:19.507 --> 29:21.259
-[commotion]
-[girl] Oh, my God!

29:21.342 --> 29:22.719
After three crimes,

29:22.802 --> 29:24.721
I was starting to think he may never stop.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.599
[Peter] The Turd Burglar
committed three crimes

29:27.682 --> 29:29.559
over the course of eight days.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.812
And Kevin confessed to all of them.

29:33.730 --> 29:36.024
He confessed to being the Turd Burglar.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.650
You did all three crimes.

29:38.526 --> 29:40.403
[Peter] A serial vandal.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.446
Yes.

29:44.282 --> 29:47.535
[calm piano music playing]

29:59.964 --> 30:03.176
Bless us, oh Lord, for these thy gifts
which we are about to receive

30:03.259 --> 30:06.262
from thy bounty
through Christ Our Lord. Amen.

30:06.346 --> 30:07.222
Amen.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.307
Amen!

30:09.557 --> 30:13.228
My name is Patricia McClain.
I'm Kevin's grandmother,

30:13.645 --> 30:16.272
so I know him better than anyone.

30:16.940 --> 30:20.735
He's a funny kid, very perceptive.

30:21.444 --> 30:23.738
If there's something that's not right,

30:23.822 --> 30:26.658
like the temperature of his food, or...

30:26.741 --> 30:29.285
or the way you fold his laundry,

30:29.369 --> 30:31.871
oh, he'll let you know about it.
[nervous chuckle]

30:32.872 --> 30:35.250
When I first heard of what they were
accusing him of...

30:35.333 --> 30:38.753
Forty innocent kids pooped in their pants.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.464
I just said, "No way."
I couldn't believe it.

30:41.548 --> 30:43.758
Do you have a grudge
against Nick Sondergoth?

30:43.842 --> 30:46.636
I know that he is innocent.

30:46.719 --> 30:48.805
[Joe] You don't like your classmates,
do you, Kevin?

30:48.888 --> 30:50.807
-Fruit Ninja!
-You can't throw a watermelon at me.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.141
You kind of resent them.

30:52.225 --> 30:53.434
[guy] Fruit Ninja!

30:53.518 --> 30:56.813
There was no way that he would make
his fellow classmates

30:57.063 --> 30:58.189
poop their pants.

30:58.273 --> 31:01.317
People making fun of my shit stain?
I'd make them shit their pants too.

31:02.443 --> 31:03.862
You think poop is funny?!

31:03.945 --> 31:07.407
If that's what they're saying,
that he poisoned the lemonade...

31:07.991 --> 31:11.119
You put the laxatives in the lemonade.

31:11.202 --> 31:15.290
...that he caused his fellow students
to defecate uncontrollably...

31:15.957 --> 31:17.750
"Look, there's Shit Stain McClain!"

31:17.834 --> 31:19.210
[boy] Hey, Shit Stain McClain!

31:19.294 --> 31:20.753
...then let me ask you this.

31:20.837 --> 31:23.840
You did the Brownout,
you did all three crimes.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.970
Why did Kevin poop his own pants?

31:29.053 --> 31:31.264
[tense sound effect]

31:33.600 --> 31:35.018
[tension resolves]
