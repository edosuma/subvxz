01:13.840 --> 01:16.710
This is Zack Morris for KKTY.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.845
I'm here with the captain
of Bayside's wrestling team,

01:18.878 --> 01:20.980
AC Slater,
for the first day of tryouts.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.217
Tell me, Slater,
how is the team shaping up?

01:24.250 --> 01:28.555
I'm getting a little worried
if the rest of them are
anything like this guy.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.190
( moaning )

01:30.223 --> 01:34.127
Excuse me, why do you want
to be on the wrestling team?

01:34.160 --> 01:37.831
I don't, l was just
cutting through the gym.

01:39.866 --> 01:42.936
- Hey, sorry about that, kid.
- ( groans )

01:42.969 --> 01:46.673
This has been another
live report for KKTY.

01:46.706 --> 01:49.309
Okay, Zack,
you're on the air.

01:49.342 --> 01:51.878
What?
I was just on the air.

01:51.911 --> 01:54.614
No you weren't.
I just flipped on the switch,
dummy.

01:54.647 --> 01:57.117
Turn it off, bonehead,
I'm done.

01:57.751 --> 01:58.985
Excuse me?

01:59.019 --> 02:01.121
You're perfect,
you don't need any excuses.

02:01.154 --> 02:03.089
Can you tell me where
a Coach Sonski is?

02:03.123 --> 02:05.258
I'm here to try out
for the wrestling team.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.861
- But you're a girl.
- Gosh, you're quick.

02:09.596 --> 02:12.098
- ( whistle blows )
- All right, men,

02:12.132 --> 02:15.869
everybody trying out for
the wrestling team
line up over here.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.605
Have your sign up cards ready.

02:19.072 --> 02:20.607
That's my cue.

02:22.709 --> 02:26.112
- Rodriguez, welcome back.
- Thanks, Coach.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.149
Anderson, whoa,
you gotta lose some weight.

02:30.183 --> 02:34.154
- AC, my man, my star.
- Hey.

02:34.187 --> 02:35.989
Are we gonna
beat Valley next week?

02:36.089 --> 02:38.758
- They're gonna eat mat, sir.
- Group: Yeah.

02:40.927 --> 02:43.663
Kristy Barnes.
( laughs )

02:43.697 --> 02:47.200
That's cute, honey.
This is a gym, not a Jane.

02:49.102 --> 02:52.906
Why don't you go
upstairs to home ec
and bake us some brownies?

02:52.939 --> 02:56.209
No,
I wanna try out for the team.
I'm as good as anybody here.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.144
Yeah, sure, toots.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.347
Coach,
are you saying you aren't
gonna let Kristy try out

03:00.380 --> 03:04.050
- simply because of her sex?
- Yeah,
the wrestling team's for guys.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.286
You wanna wrestle
with the girls, date 'em.

03:07.954 --> 03:09.589
That's not fair!

03:09.622 --> 03:11.958
I don't have hair
and that's not fair either.

03:14.327 --> 03:16.062
All right, men.

03:16.096 --> 03:19.065
Hit the mats, I gotta pick
a team to beat
Valley next week.

03:22.268 --> 03:24.704
It's wrong.
They won't even
give me a chance.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.874
I'm Zack Morris and I'm gonna
help you get that chance.

03:27.907 --> 03:30.343
Guys, I want you to meet
Kristy Barnes.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.778
- Hi, Kristy.
- Nice to meet you.

03:31.811 --> 03:34.948
She needs our help.
Coach won't let her try out
for the wrestling team.

03:34.981 --> 03:37.283
- Why not?
- Because I'm a girl.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.285
That's discrimination,
he can't do that.

03:39.319 --> 03:42.389
He did it, Mama. What's your
big mouth gonna do about it?

03:44.090 --> 03:46.092
We can't let him
get away with this.

03:46.126 --> 03:49.829
And we won't. This is
sexist pigism of
the worst kind.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.232
- But what can we do about it?
- We gotta fight back.

03:52.265 --> 03:55.402
- We'll go right
to the top on this.
- Don't be an idiot, Zack,

03:55.435 --> 03:58.304
President Bush is too busy.

03:58.338 --> 04:01.041
No, you twink,
we'll take it to Mr. Belding.

04:01.041 --> 04:04.844
Underneath it all,
he's a fair-minded,
sensitive man

04:04.878 --> 04:06.312
and a real friend
to the students.

04:06.346 --> 04:09.883
( Belding laughing )

04:09.916 --> 04:11.217
Hello, everybody.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.953
I've got the funniest topic
for my show today.

04:14.054 --> 04:17.089
- What?
- Coach Sonski
says that some girl

04:17.123 --> 04:19.192
came in to try out
for the wrestling team.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.063
Can you believe it?

04:25.065 --> 04:26.866
Here's your food, guys.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.269
Where's mine?

04:29.302 --> 04:31.838
Get it yourself,
Miss Digging for Dirt.

04:31.871 --> 04:33.106
There goes your tip.

04:34.307 --> 04:36.743
Kristy, we're gonna get you
that wrestling tryout

04:36.776 --> 04:39.145
- before you can
say Hulk Hogan.
- What do you mean?

04:39.179 --> 04:42.916
Jessie's about to use
the power of the airwaves.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.186
<i>This is Jessica Spano</i>
<i>for "Spano Speaks."</i>

04:46.219 --> 04:49.389
There were a lot
of snorts and grunts
heard at Bayside yesterday,

04:49.422 --> 04:52.892
and they weren't just from
the sweaty,
red-faced wrestlers.

04:52.926 --> 04:56.129
<i>They were from the snouts</i>
<i>of Bayside's two</i>
<i>biggest sexist pigs,</i>

04:56.162 --> 04:59.132
<i>Coach Sonski</i>
<i>and Principal Richard Belding.</i>

04:59.165 --> 05:02.035
- Kelly: Whoa, be careful.
- Way to go, Jessie.

05:02.035 --> 05:05.905
I'd like to present them
with the Double Swine Award.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.341
( pig snorts )

05:10.043 --> 05:12.379
<i>I say if a woman wants</i>
<i>to wrestle with the grunts,</i>

05:12.412 --> 05:14.080
<i>that's her business.</i>

05:14.114 --> 05:18.218
So, fellow students,
support women's rights.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.320
( pop music playing )

05:21.187 --> 05:23.256
( chanting )

05:26.793 --> 05:30.363
You are too much.
How can I thank
you for all of this?

05:30.397 --> 05:34.134
I'll think
of something interesting.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.170
- ( chanting continues )
- Yo, what's goin' on here?

05:37.203 --> 05:39.439
Get off those mats.
I just had them pressed.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.174
Stop macho pigism!

05:41.207 --> 05:43.443
It is absolute
pandemonium in the gym.

05:43.476 --> 05:46.846
Coach Sonski, how does it feel
to be the most
hated man at Bayside?

05:46.880 --> 05:49.215
Oh, I don't care if I'm hated.

05:49.249 --> 05:52.252
I have pets at home
that love me.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.187
Probably a pig.

05:54.220 --> 05:57.257
No, no, we won't go!
No, no, we won't go!

05:57.290 --> 06:00.860
- No, no, we won't go!
- I want all you
kids outta here.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.929
- No, no, we won't go!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

06:03.029 --> 06:05.899
- What is going on here?
- No, no, we won't go!

06:05.932 --> 06:07.801
- No, no, we won't go!
- ( Belding shouting )

06:07.834 --> 06:10.070
- Hey-ey!
- ...we won't go!

06:10.103 --> 06:12.939
A hush falls over the crowd as
the other most
hated man at Bayside

06:13.039 --> 06:16.276
- enters the gym.
- Quiet, please.

06:16.309 --> 06:19.779
You can't shut us up.
We want equal
opportunity for Kristy.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.448
And we're not leaving
until she gets it.

06:21.481 --> 06:24.484
- All: Yeah!
- I mean if that's okay.

06:24.517 --> 06:27.387
Belding, you gonna let these
kids tell you how to
run your school?

06:27.420 --> 06:29.522
Well, of course not.

06:30.256 --> 06:31.758
Am I really hated?

06:31.791 --> 06:34.194
Yes-sssss!

06:34.227 --> 06:36.496
Mr. B, Coach, look,

06:36.529 --> 06:40.233
she says she's
a good wrestler,
why not let her try out?

06:40.266 --> 06:44.204
It's her right as a chick.
I mean as a liberated chick.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.973
Come on, Coach,
why not give her a chance?

06:47.073 --> 06:50.276
Okay, I'm sensitive to dames.
I watch "Oprah."

06:50.310 --> 06:53.279
- All: Yeah!
- Slater: All right, Coach.

06:53.313 --> 06:56.383
But if the little
sweetie gets mangled,
I'm not responsible.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.286
- What do you weigh, honey?
- 110 pounds.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.821
Folks, we have
just witnessed history.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.858
This is
the first girl at Bayside
to admit her weight.

07:04.891 --> 07:06.760
Rodriguez, <i>andale.</i>

07:08.461 --> 07:11.798
Don't worry, little girl,
I won't hurt you.

07:11.831 --> 07:16.136
- Oo-ooh, I'm shaking.
- All right,
take your positions.

07:16.169 --> 07:19.139
Kristy faces a tough test,
Rodriguez is one of Bayside's

07:19.172 --> 07:22.042
best wrestlers
and reigning
nerd-toss champion.

07:22.042 --> 07:25.912
- ( crowd cheering )
- All right. Ready.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.214
- On the whistle.
- ( whistle blows )

07:28.248 --> 07:30.316
( cheering continues )

07:39.592 --> 07:42.962
Do you believe in miracles?
Well, Kristy wins
in a stunning upset.

07:43.063 --> 07:46.566
I hope this doesn't affect
his nerd tossing, Zack.

07:46.599 --> 07:49.903
Look at her,
not a hair out of place.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.439
- Hey,
you're really good, Kristy.
- Thanks.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.374
- What do you think, Coach?
- With you and the babe

07:54.407 --> 07:56.509
we got a great chance
of winning
the league this year.

07:56.543 --> 07:58.511
Welcome to the team, Kristy.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.148
Way to go, Kristy.

08:02.182 --> 08:05.218
- Kristy, you were terrific.
- I couldn't have
done it without you.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.821
We sisters have
to stick together.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.161
- And a special
thanks to you, Zack.
- Well, I...

08:16.296 --> 08:18.031
Hey!

08:19.466 --> 08:22.035
I tell you, this is
one hold l could get used to.

08:25.405 --> 08:27.474
Here, it's on the house
for making the team.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.110
All right.
Make a wish.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.645
- I wish we'd beat Valley.
- All: Yeah!

08:35.181 --> 08:37.817
- Can I have the candle?
- Sure,
you want to lick the icing?

08:37.851 --> 08:39.586
No, I love to chew wax.

08:42.489 --> 08:45.125
He was raised by wolves.

08:45.158 --> 08:48.161
- This looks delicious.
- Too bad you can't eat it.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.865
- You're in training now.
- You're right.
You take it, Zack.

08:51.898 --> 08:53.767
- I wouldn't be on
the team without you.
- Well, thanks.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.169
See you later, we gotta
head to the radio station.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.438
- Come on, Screech.
- Oh, wait, Zack,

08:58.471 --> 09:01.441
- are you gonna
eat that wrapper?
- No, why?

09:01.474 --> 09:04.711
After eating wax, there's
nothing like a good wrapper
to wash it down.

09:04.744 --> 09:06.446
( groans )

09:06.479 --> 09:09.015
Get out of here.
Come on.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.418
Jessie, thanks for helping me
make the team.

09:11.451 --> 09:13.887
I just stood up
for what l believed in.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.023
Oh,
she's a cute little feminist,
isn't she?

09:18.458 --> 09:20.160
You're on thin ice, bubba.

09:21.928 --> 09:25.098
Don't you ever
go off duty, girl?

09:25.131 --> 09:27.701
Kristy, that was a great move
you put on Rodriguez.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.036
- Where'd you learn it?
- From you.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.039
You used it on Ninick
in last year's
city championship.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.042
- You saw me?
- You were awesome.

09:36.042 --> 09:38.845
You know, this year
you are gonna be
state champion.

09:38.878 --> 09:42.048
How about that, Mama?
Isn't that great?

09:42.048 --> 09:44.217
Oh, golly, yes.

09:44.250 --> 09:48.088
Would you mind showing me
your best hold sometime?

09:48.121 --> 09:49.823
Yeah, sure.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.792
How about right now?
I'm not busy.

09:52.826 --> 09:56.096
- Do you mind, Jessie?
- No, Jessie doesn't mind.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.064
Nah, she's your biggest
supporter.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.533
Come on,
let's go hit the mats.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.106
Where did everybody go?

10:06.139 --> 10:08.775
Jessie doesn't
care to discuss it.

10:11.878 --> 10:14.714
This is Zack Morris
broadcasting live from a place

10:14.748 --> 10:17.617
where no guy has gone before.
Know where?

10:17.650 --> 10:19.619
- ( screams )
- Oh-ho, you guessed it.

10:19.652 --> 10:22.022
I'm in the girls' locker room.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.758
I'm in no-man's
land to interview
Bayside's newest...

10:24.791 --> 10:27.093
hey, and cutest wrestler,
Kristy Barnes.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.063
Get out of here.
What are you doing?
You're gonna get in trouble.

10:30.096 --> 10:33.566
No risk is too great to
capture the athlete in
her natural habitat.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.602
You're nuts.

10:35.635 --> 10:40.040
Tell me, Kristy,
what's it like being the only
girl on the wrestling team?

10:40.073 --> 10:43.176
It's fun.
The guys are
really nice to me.

10:43.209 --> 10:46.046
Probably because I can
pin most of them.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.215
- Now get out of here.
- Not until we get
a little personal.

10:49.249 --> 10:52.085
Every guy at Bayside
wants to know one thing.

10:52.118 --> 10:53.920
Okay, what's that?

10:53.953 --> 10:58.091
- What kind of guy
does Kristy like?
- Oh, I don't know.

10:58.124 --> 11:01.261
Perhaps the kind of guy
who would sneak into
a girls' locker room?

11:01.294 --> 11:04.230
Maybe. Look, Zack,
I gotta hit the showers.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.332
Hey, no sweat,
we'll just do
the interview in there.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.835
Oh, no we won't!

11:08.868 --> 11:12.672
This is Zack
Morris reporting live
from the promised land.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.313
This has been real fun.
Would you like to
go to the movies tonight?

11:20.347 --> 11:23.817
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Pick you up at about...
7:30?

11:23.850 --> 11:26.286
- Yeah, okay.
- Zack Morris!

11:26.319 --> 11:28.888
I know you're in here!

11:28.922 --> 11:31.925
And if I catch you in here,

11:31.958 --> 11:35.295
you... are... suspended!

11:36.396 --> 11:38.665
Where are you Morris?!

11:40.000 --> 11:41.835
Morris?

11:41.868 --> 11:45.372
Morris?!
Mor... ris?

11:45.405 --> 11:48.108
- Gotcha!
- ( both scream )

11:51.011 --> 11:55.115
That principal who
was in the girls' locker
room will remain nameless.

11:55.115 --> 11:58.151
And now, I've saved
the juiciest item for last.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.820
- Where does
Lisa get this stuff?
- She's good, Jessie.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.789
She knew about my zit
at the big game.

12:02.822 --> 12:05.358
<i>What school hunk</i>
<i>and lady wrestler</i>
<i>are putting the moves</i>

12:05.392 --> 12:08.728
<i>- on each other</i>
<i>outside the gym?</i>
- What?

12:08.762 --> 12:12.232
<i>Take it from me,</i>
<i>this new couple</i>
<i>is flipping over each other.</i>

12:12.265 --> 12:15.068
- That can't be.
- She wouldn't say
it if it wasn't true.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.970
<i>As you know, I never lie.</i>

12:17.070 --> 12:19.906
<i>I saw them with my own</i>
<i>beautiful brown eyes.</i>

12:19.939 --> 12:24.110
- Are you sure?
<i>- Surely a match</i>
<i>made in heaven.</i>

12:24.144 --> 12:27.147
I don't believe you.
You're lying. You're lying.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.249
( radio static fades )

12:30.750 --> 12:33.286
She's my friend,
but not my best friend.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.422
Actually
I hardly even know her.

12:38.158 --> 12:42.729
I'm still having trouble with
those escape holds you
were showing me.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.898
Okay, okay, look,
they're not too hard.

12:44.931 --> 12:48.001
Let's try
the Full Nelson Escape.
Go ahead, put me in one.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.407
( gasps )
Too cool.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.309
All right, now you try it.

13:00.046 --> 13:03.249
Whoa,
that was pretty good, Kristy.
Not bad.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.952
You worked on the Full Nelson
and the Half Nelson,

13:06.052 --> 13:07.354
why don't you show her
the Willie Nelson?

13:09.055 --> 13:11.725
That's a country
and wrestling joke.

13:11.758 --> 13:15.395
I got spurs
that jingle-jangle-jingle.

13:16.730 --> 13:19.165
Can I try the Reverse
Bearhug Escape?

13:19.199 --> 13:20.700
Yeah, sure.

13:20.734 --> 13:23.703
- I wanna get this right.
- Okay.

13:23.737 --> 13:25.905
Good, just hold me tighter.

13:27.173 --> 13:29.376
Wow, you're really strong.

13:30.744 --> 13:32.879
( Jessie screams )

13:35.949 --> 13:39.085
I loved the movie.
So romantic.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.887
Wasn't Michelle Pfeiffer
beautiful?

13:40.920 --> 13:43.089
Compared to you,
she was a bow-wow.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.959
- Come on, Zack.
- No, I mean it, Kristy.

13:45.992 --> 13:49.462
You look so great tonight.
So much like a... like a girl.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.831
I am a girl, you know?

13:51.865 --> 13:55.101
I know all right.
I was watching you more
than the movie.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.941
Well, look who's here.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.844
If it's not Bayside's
big bad lady wrestler.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.180
Why don't you
just leave us alone?
We're on a date.

14:07.213 --> 14:10.850
Shut up, Morris
or I'll twist
you into a pretzel.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.419
Look,
I don't want any trouble.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.922
Why don't you
go back to Valley
and find your brain?

14:15.955 --> 14:18.725
What's your problem?
Are you nuts? Just chill...

14:20.093 --> 14:22.195
- Are you gonna
leave us alone?
- No.

14:22.228 --> 14:24.330
Oh, ouch, okay.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.070
We're not just gonna beat you,
we're gonna murder you.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.072
Beat it!

14:32.072 --> 14:34.107
( crowd laughs )

14:36.543 --> 14:39.846
- Are you okay, Zack?
- I...yeah, I guess.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.850
Wow, Kristy,
you're one very strong woman.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.519
Yeah, it's lucky for you
she was here, huh, Morris?

14:47.153 --> 14:49.222
Yeah, lucky me.

14:54.594 --> 14:58.331
<i>* KKTY... Bayside *</i>

14:58.365 --> 15:01.601
This is Jessica Spano
for "Spano Speaks."

15:01.634 --> 15:04.471
Recently I gave an editorial
supporting a girl's right

15:04.504 --> 15:06.639
to wrestle on a guys' team.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.542
Boy, was I ever wrong.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.312
Girls have absolutely
no business wrestling guys.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.647
The poor dears could get hurt.

15:14.681 --> 15:18.918
In conclusion, keep your hands
off our men, Kristy.

15:22.956 --> 15:26.059
What was that all about?
I thought you
were all for Kristy.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.595
I know you are.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.063
What's that supposed to mean?

15:30.063 --> 15:33.433
"Oh, Slater, you're so strong.
Hold me tighter."

15:35.769 --> 15:39.372
So that's what
this is all about.
You're jealous.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.708
Come on,
I was just helping a teammate.

15:41.741 --> 15:44.844
Oh yeah?
When was the last time
you held Rodriguez like that?

15:47.080 --> 15:50.850
Why would I want a girl like
Kristy when I can have
a nut-cake like you?

15:53.086 --> 15:56.456
Don't try flattering me,
it won't get you anywhere.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.726
Men!

15:59.759 --> 16:01.061
Chicks!

16:04.731 --> 16:07.867
I can't believe it.
Jessie was my
biggest supporter.

16:07.901 --> 16:09.502
Why would
she say those things?

16:09.536 --> 16:11.304
Maybe she's having a bad day.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.073
That's not it,
her hair's too tight.

16:13.106 --> 16:16.042
I told her not
to wear barrettes
while the moon was full.

16:16.543 --> 16:17.477
What?

16:17.510 --> 16:20.313
It's the gravitational pull
on the follicles.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.449
She was a helpless victim
of nature.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.053
- Hi, Kristy.
- I'm glad you're here.
Did you hear...

16:27.087 --> 16:29.422
Kristy, I can't go
to the movies
with you tonight.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.791
I have to... study.

16:31.825 --> 16:35.562
- Both: Study?!
- Another
casualty of the moon.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.697
I'd better get home
before it gets dark.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.471
Okay,
Zack, why don't we just go
to the movies tomorrow night?

16:45.438 --> 16:48.975
Kristy, it isn't that.
I just...

16:49.075 --> 16:51.544
I just don't think we should
see each other anymore.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.480
It's not working
out between us.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.882
Oh.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.485
Does this have anything to do
with what
happened on our date?

16:58.518 --> 17:02.022
- Well...
- What a great day.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.590
First Jessie wants me off
the wrestling team

17:04.624 --> 17:08.328
and now you can't handle
going out with
a girl wrestler.

17:08.361 --> 17:12.464
I'm gonna make you both happy,
I'm quitting the team.

17:17.103 --> 17:19.406
I would feel the same
even if she wasn't trying

17:19.439 --> 17:22.041
- to wrestle my
man away from me.
- Your man?

17:22.041 --> 17:24.544
Kristy doesn't like Slater,
she likes me.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.880
Ha, ha, ha,
I could see right through it.

17:26.913 --> 17:30.450
- I knew she liked Slater.
- Jessie, read my lips,

17:30.483 --> 17:33.386
Kristy likes me, not Slater.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.889
But Lisa said
Kristy was going out
with a school hunk.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.491
And what do I look like?
A bologna sandwich?

17:39.893 --> 17:42.095
Oops.
What have I done?

17:42.128 --> 17:44.064
Yeah, what have we done?

17:44.064 --> 17:46.866
I was a jealous,
possessive fool.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.135
And I was a fool too,
as usual.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.971
Well, we blew it.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.741
We can't let
her quit the team.
I'll go talk to her.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.911
No,
no, no, you've talked enough.
I'll go talk to her.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.013
Let's hope she doesn't
body slam me.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.684
Leave me alone, Zack.

18:04.718 --> 18:06.920
I told you,
I don't want to talk to you.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.156
Then I'm coming in.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.725
You better get out of here.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.560
If Belding catches you,
you're gonna get suspended.

18:13.593 --> 18:17.731
- I don't care.
I have to talk to you.
- It's a free country, talk.

18:19.065 --> 18:21.601
Kristy, this isn't
easy for me to say,

18:21.634 --> 18:24.938
but I was embarrassed when
you wouldn't let me fight
the guy at The Max.

18:25.038 --> 18:26.539
So?

18:26.573 --> 18:29.075
So the point is a guy
should protect the girl.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.745
I couldn't handle it
when you had to protect me.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.181
- I didn't mean
to embarrass you.
- I know that.

18:35.215 --> 18:39.219
Kristy, you love wrestling.
Don't quit the team
over a jerk like me.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.688
Do you really mean it?

18:42.088 --> 18:44.524
Jerk's honor.

18:44.557 --> 18:45.825
Will you ever forgive me?

18:46.593 --> 18:48.728
On one condition...

18:48.762 --> 18:50.797
if you take me
to the movies tomorrow night.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.499
I'd be afraid not to.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.810
Okay, sports fans,
this should be
a great contest.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.845
Briggs and Slater
are both undefeated.

19:05.879 --> 19:08.048
And they've never
lost either, Zack.

19:09.883 --> 19:11.818
Ready? Okay!

19:11.851 --> 19:15.689
Here comes Slater, he's got
guts! Slam down Valley!
Kick their butts!

19:19.092 --> 19:22.796
Let me tell you, this promises
to be a long, grueling match.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.731
Wrestlers ready!

19:25.632 --> 19:27.067
( whistle blows )

19:30.236 --> 19:31.905
( whistle blows )

19:33.540 --> 19:36.209
Yes, yes, and Slater wins
in record time.

19:36.242 --> 19:40.046
Bayside and Valley are tied,
three matches apiece,
with one to go.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.815
Zack:
Tension is mounting.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.617
This match will determine
the winner of the meet.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.720
Will it be Valley's
Skipper Skulnick?

19:46.753 --> 19:49.856
Or Bayside's first female
wrestler in league history,
Kristy Barnes?

19:49.889 --> 19:51.791
I think so, Zack.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.662
All right, Kristy,
it's up to you now.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.631
If you get into trouble
just remember
what I taught you.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.233
All right.

20:00.266 --> 20:05.005
Hey, Kristy, I'm sorry,
I was wrong about you.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.741
- And you too.
- It's okay, Mama.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.642
I'm used to you by now.

20:12.579 --> 20:15.048
All right,
all right, here we go.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.250
One, two, three, Tigers!

20:18.184 --> 20:21.254
Wrestlers... take your places!

20:23.656 --> 20:25.592
Places! Ready!

20:27.394 --> 20:30.764
( whistle blows,
crowd cheering )

20:30.797 --> 20:33.233
Skulnick and Barnes
are circling each other.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.335
( crowd cheering )

20:38.238 --> 20:41.641
Zack: Oh, no, Skulnick
has Barnes in a Full Nelson.

20:41.675 --> 20:44.944
- She's in trouble.
- Come on,
Kristy, you can do it.

20:44.978 --> 20:48.314
- Fight him, Kristy!
- Yeah, yeah!

20:48.348 --> 20:51.017
Skulnick is forcing Kristy
to the mat.

20:52.786 --> 20:54.821
Do something, Zack.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.856
Kristy, use the hold
you used at The Max.

20:56.890 --> 20:58.925
( cheering continues )

21:07.701 --> 21:09.769
( whistle blows )

21:17.744 --> 21:20.213
All right!

21:20.246 --> 21:23.350
Kristy, how does it feel
to make league history?

21:23.383 --> 21:25.618
- Great!
- ( Zack groans )

21:30.090 --> 21:32.125
Ladies and gentlemen,
that was Kristy Barnes,

21:32.158 --> 21:34.994
our new star wrestler
and also my date for tonight.

21:35.095 --> 21:37.864
and if anyone has
a problem with that,
she'll beat you up.

21:46.172 --> 21:48.742
( instrumental
theme music playing )
