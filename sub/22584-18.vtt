01:18.720 --> 01:20.472
Live long and prosper.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.269
Board that ship!
Take everything you can!

03:01.080 --> 03:04.117
Captain's Starlog, January 13,2155.

03:04.240 --> 03:06.310
We've left Gorlan Station
and have set a course...

03:06.440 --> 03:08.078
to rendezvous with our assault fleet.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.589
Major Reed and the Doctor
have asked for a few minutes...

03:10.720 --> 03:12.676
to show me their latest project.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.515
The Booth will be far more effective
than our previous disciplinary methods.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.712
It can stimulate the pain centre
of virtually any humanoid.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.673
A synaptic scan calibrates it
for each species.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.918
They call this progress.

03:32.360 --> 03:35.193
There's something to be said
for a good old-fashioned flogging.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.754
That's what's so exceptional
about this device.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.952
Traditional forms of punishment
can overwhelm the nervous system.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.150
After a time,
the brain ceases to feel anything.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.350
These sensors continually shift
the stimulation...

03:45.480 --> 03:47.277
from one nerve cluster to another...

03:47.400 --> 03:50.119
keeping the subject
in a constant state of agony.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.519
I think you enjoy your work
too much, Doctor.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.030
What exactly did Mr. Terev do?

03:59.040 --> 04:02.476
I'm not certain.
I suspect he was late for his duty shift.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.314
Aren't all Tellarites guilty of something?

04:09.200 --> 04:11.156
Did you get a chance
to look over my proposal?

04:11.280 --> 04:13.316
-I read it.
-And?

04:13.560 --> 04:15.710
We're going to rendezvous
with the fleet as ordered.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.991
I'm not going into Tholian space based
on data from some anonymous source.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.350
Maybe you haven't heard,
we have a rebellion to put down.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.469
The Tholians aren't part of it.

04:22.600 --> 04:26.434
You saw the data. This technology
would give us a tactical advantage.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.471
We could end the war tomorrow.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.473
You see this as your big chance,
don't you?

04:32.840 --> 04:33.829
Sir?

04:33.960 --> 04:36.838
You bring that ship home,
and you'll be a hero.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.556
The Emperor pins a medal
on your chest.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.672
You might even get that command
you've always wanted.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.630
My only concern is saving the Empire.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.552
Resume your station.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.270
Captain, you're making a mistake.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.993
You can either go back to the Bridge,
or take the place of that Tellarite.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.918
Which do you prefer?

05:07.760 --> 05:09.034
Understood.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.150
What do you think you're doing?

05:20.800 --> 05:22.677
Reviewing status reports.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.394
This is supposed to be your sanctuary.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.110
A place to get away...

05:29.960 --> 05:31.598
from status reports.

05:45.920 --> 05:49.549
You're the one person on this ship
that I don't mind giving in to.

05:49.680 --> 05:53.878
And probably the only one that
doesn't want to slip a knife in your back.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.879
I heard the battle went well at Tau Ceti.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.318
Is that what you heard?

06:03.160 --> 06:06.038
Word on the ship is
that the war may be over soon.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.072
I'll go back to Brazil,
start teaching again.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.277
You'll accept a comfortable desk job
at Headquarters.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.511
We'll have the weekends.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.115
You've been listening to propaganda.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.590
Things went badly at Tau Ceti.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.634
Very badly.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.112
We lost 12 ships.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.512
Keep this to yourself.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.358
If the crew learns
what really happened....

06:37.480 --> 06:39.550
Forget about the war.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.277
This is our time.

07:01.800 --> 07:02.835
Don't!

07:06.720 --> 07:08.278
You'll hang for this.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.958
-Lock him in the Brig.
-Sir.

07:10.080 --> 07:13.914
Let me take him down to the Cargo Bay.
I'll finish him quickly, quietly.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.559
I want him alive.

07:19.360 --> 07:23.114
Still, it'd be tragic if there was
an accident on the way to the Brig.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.676
If anything happens to Forrest,
I'll shoot you myself.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.438
Are we clear, Major?

07:29.600 --> 07:31.033
Perfectly, sir.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.038
Stand aside, Commander.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.397
Where's Captain Forrest?

07:54.640 --> 07:56.153
Contact Security.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.996
This is First Officer Archer.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.113
In accordance
with Starfleet orders this date...

08:13.240 --> 08:15.674
I've relieved Captain Forrest of duty...

08:15.800 --> 08:17.791
and assumed command of Enterprise.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.514
My orders are to take the ship
into Tholian space...

08:20.640 --> 08:23.438
for a mission
of vital importance to the Empire.

08:23.560 --> 08:26.996
I can't reveal the details of
our assignment, but I can tell you this:

08:27.120 --> 08:29.076
If we're successful...

08:29.200 --> 08:32.794
Starfleet will crush the rebellion
once and for all.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.671
No crew in Starfleet
has been tested more in battle.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.115
I know I can count on each of you...

08:40.240 --> 08:43.198
to perform your duty
to the best of your ability.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.673
Nothing will impede
our march towards victory.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.674
-Long live the Empire.
-Long live the Empire!

08:56.720 --> 09:00.156
We've received no such communiqués
from Starfleet Command.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.518
-lt was sent on a private channel.
-I'd like to see those orders.

09:09.640 --> 09:11.073
All in good time.

09:11.760 --> 09:15.799
Alter our heading. 2-1-5 mark 13.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.351
-Maximum warp.
-Yes, Captain.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.436
Corporal. Escort Commander T'Pol
to Cargo Bay 2.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.751
You'll find
a Suliban cloaking device there.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.713
Bring it to Engineering
and help Tucker install it.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.391
We're going to need the cloak
to complete this mission.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.712
Enterprise Starlog,
Captain Jonathan Archer.

10:07.160 --> 10:10.118
The crew has accepted the change
of command without incident.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.719
Chief Engineer Tucker reports...

10:11.840 --> 10:14.513
we'll have cloaking capability
within six hours.

10:16.120 --> 10:18.509
These orders appear to be authentic.

10:18.720 --> 10:19.835
Appear?

10:20.760 --> 10:23.320
All I require from you is your loyalty.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.913
Do I have it?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.752
You are in command.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.996
I'm glad we can agree on something.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.632
Do you recognise this?

10:35.360 --> 10:37.430
It belonged to Zefram Cochrane.

10:37.920 --> 10:41.310
He used it to kill the first Vulcan
who stepped onto Terran soil.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.158
I wonder how history
would have played out...

10:43.280 --> 10:46.352
if Cochrane hadn't turned the tables
on your invasion force.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.914
Humans might be your slaves
instead of the other way around.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.519
I'm not a slave.

10:51.640 --> 10:52.993
You're Vulcan.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.038
Never forget that.

10:59.640 --> 11:01.551
How long until we cross
into Tholian space?

11:01.680 --> 11:03.875
It's likely we already have.

11:04.520 --> 11:08.672
They frequently annexe systems
outside their core territory.

11:09.320 --> 11:13.598
There's a warp signature encoded on
this. Notify me the moment you find it.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.594
-lf there's nothing further--
-There is.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.550
I'm promoting you to First Officer.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.075
Major Reed's next in line.
He won't be pleased--

11:22.200 --> 11:25.590
Reed is a capable soldier,
but he has trouble following orders.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.234
And I know he has ambitions of his own.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.512
You've made it clear
you don't approve of Vulcans.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.470
Maybe this is my way of saying
thank you to you and your people.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.432
Without Vulcan technology, the Empire
wouldn't be where it is today.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.468
Dismissed.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.514
Serving as my personal guard
will have its privileges.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.359
You'll have your own quarters,
better food.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.359
You'll accept orders from me,
and me alone. Is that clear?

12:07.480 --> 12:08.629
Yes, sir.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.951
And Captain, if I may...

12:11.720 --> 12:15.349
I'd like to be the first to congratulate you
on a brilliant strategy.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.072
I'm certain that in years to come--

12:17.200 --> 12:20.954
You already have the job, Sergeant.
Don't talk yourself out of it.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.676
Don't mind Porthos.
He hasn't had his dinner yet.

12:28.520 --> 12:29.635
Come in.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.199
That'll be all.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.520
You didn't receive a communiqué
from Starfleet.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.154
I would have known
if something came through.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.993
A mutiny.

12:55.920 --> 12:59.435
-Didn't think you had it in you.
-I'll take that as a compliment.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.915
-Where's Captain Forrest?
-He's safe.

13:04.320 --> 13:08.199
How do I know that
you didn't push him out of an airlock?

13:18.440 --> 13:20.954
-I want to talk to him.
-Not right now.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.274
He'll remain alive
as long as you don't cause any trouble.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.630
No hidden distress signals to Starfleet.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.593
I need you and your expertise.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.318
Is that all you need?

13:41.560 --> 13:43.994
You've never forgiven me for leaving.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.877
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

13:50.160 --> 13:53.470
You saw an opportunity
for advancement and you took it.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.719
Just as you did.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.560
You should have been Captain
from the moment we left spacedock.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.193
You've always known that.

14:01.320 --> 14:04.949
If it hadn't been for all those admirals
conspiring behind your back...

14:05.080 --> 14:05.360
Enterprise would have been yours.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.316
Enterprise would have been yours.

14:10.920 --> 14:13.115
Tradition says that whatever...

14:14.080 --> 14:16.355
belonged to the previous Captain...

14:17.320 --> 14:19.151
is yours for the taking.

14:22.440 --> 14:25.238
I've never been one
to argue with tradition.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.277
T'Pol to Captain Archer.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.230
Maybe we should keep our relationship
on a professional level.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.916
Captain Archer, please respond.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.794
Go ahead.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.229
We're approaching the warp signature.

14:50.360 --> 14:51.588
On my way.

14:59.080 --> 15:02.197
I expect you to be in a better mood
when I get back.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.958
Captain on the Bridge.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.833
We're closing on target.
20,000 kilometres.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.597
There's one bio-sign aboard.
Tholian.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.276
Power the tractor emitters.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.918
He's seen us. He's arming weapons.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.632
Disable his ship.
I don't want the pilot injured.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.275
Done.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.516
There's an overload
building in his reactor.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.790
-Major?
-lt wasn't my doing, sir.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.638
I targeted his weapons only.

15:51.760 --> 15:54.558
I believe the pilot may be
attempting to destroy his own ship.

15:54.680 --> 15:58.070
Lock on the transporter.
Beam him into the Decon Chamber.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.069
Captain.

16:06.920 --> 16:08.478
We have the pilot.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.638
Archer to Sickbay.

16:13.160 --> 16:15.276
We've beamed a Tholian into Decon.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.277
Modify the atmosphere in there.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.038
It may take a moment.

16:23.920 --> 16:27.196
Tholians have rather extreme
life support requirements.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.438
Increasing temperature to 480 Kelvin.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.508
If you're angry now, just wait.

16:40.720 --> 16:43.871
-How is he?
-How is "it" would be more accurate.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.231
Tholians possess
both male and female characteristics.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.911
Its bio-signs, such as they are,
appear to be stable.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.552
Will it understand me?

17:12.079 --> 17:16.675
I'm Captain Archer. You're on board
the Terran flagship, Enterprise.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.278
Answer my questions
or you will be harmed.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.990
It's demanding to be released.

17:28.240 --> 17:31.835
I want to know where you're holding
the Terran vessel you captured.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.632
"My people will find your ship
and destroy it."

17:38.120 --> 17:41.715
A minor adjustment to life support
should make it more cooperative.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.789
Decreasing temperature 50 degrees.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.191
Tell me what I want to know.

17:55.840 --> 17:59.310
Something about
"your maternal ancestor."

18:04.000 --> 18:05.877
Take it down another 50.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.794
Its exoskeleton is beginning to fracture.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.912
"l agree, I agree."

18:19.360 --> 18:20.475
Go on.

18:24.560 --> 18:29.236
The ship is in the Vintaak system,
at a facility orbiting the gas giant.

18:31.480 --> 18:32.913
What the hell is that?

18:33.040 --> 18:34.996
A short-range transmission.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.997
A distress signal. You think it has
a comm device in there?

18:39.360 --> 18:42.511
Its crystalline structure may act
as a natural transmitter.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.352
Sir, I recommend
we beam it into space immediately.

18:46.800 --> 18:51.078
No. I need to keep it alive for now,
until I can verify what it's told us.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.399
Find some way to knock that thing out.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.473
Yes, Captain.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.512
You forget something?

19:11.280 --> 19:14.875
Biggs! Get the Commander
a radiation metre.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.790
You don't want to end up like me,
do you?

19:24.920 --> 19:26.353
I've absorbed enough delta rays...

19:26.480 --> 19:29.040
to guarantee
my grandchildren glow in the dark.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.513
Flux coupler.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.958
They say for every year you spend
next to one of these things...

19:38.080 --> 19:40.514
you lose a decade
off your life expectancy.

19:41.720 --> 19:44.359
Which means I'll probably be dead
by the end of the week.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.313
You should speak to Captain Archer
about a promotion.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.635
You're his First Officer,
you could talk to him for me.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.398
Why would I do that?

19:54.240 --> 19:55.992
I did you a favour once.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.112
-We agreed never to discuss that.
-And I haven't.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.152
I'd hardly call it a favour.
You enjoyed yourself.

20:03.280 --> 20:05.271
Several times, as I recall.

20:07.760 --> 20:11.275
So, how many years is it until
your Pon farr comes around again?

20:13.800 --> 20:15.836
Where the hell's that coming from?

20:18.960 --> 20:20.632
Pull the matrix converters!

20:29.840 --> 20:31.432
Can you repair the cloak?

20:32.160 --> 20:34.958
-lt'll take at least a day.
-You have six hours.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.910
There are dozens of EPS feeds
on this deck.

20:39.040 --> 20:43.272
And the only one that overloads is the
one connected to the cloaking device.

20:44.360 --> 20:48.148
The power surge disabled other
systems. Internal sensors are down.

20:48.280 --> 20:52.239
-We've lost grav-plating on G-Deck.
-The cloak's your first priority.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.557
Someone's responsible
for what happened. Find out who.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.797
My people can investigate this.

20:57.920 --> 21:00.912
I don't need his kind crawling around,
pulling relays.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.032
Get the cloak online.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.877
Who sabotaged the cloak?

21:14.400 --> 21:15.753
Was something damaged?

21:15.880 --> 21:19.350
I know Admiral Black has an agent
on Enterprise. I want the name.

21:19.600 --> 21:24.071
You really think that the Admiral
would plant a spy on my ship...

21:25.160 --> 21:27.116
and then tell me who it is?

21:28.920 --> 21:31.798
Go to his quarters,
search his personal files.

21:31.960 --> 21:33.598
Look for messages from Starfleet.

21:33.720 --> 21:37.315
Follow his orders, and you'll be
executed as a co-conspirator.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.238
Aye, Captain.

21:51.120 --> 21:53.236
This isn't like you, Jonathan.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.153
You never lusted for power and glory.

21:58.960 --> 22:02.270
That's why I trusted you
at my side all these years...

22:03.120 --> 22:05.236
because you have no ambition.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.791
If that's right,
then why are you in the Brig?

22:26.160 --> 22:27.718
Release me...

22:27.840 --> 22:32.516
and I promise your death will be quick.

22:34.680 --> 22:37.478
You won't get that guarantee
from the Admiral.

22:42.680 --> 22:43.908
Kill me...

22:45.160 --> 22:47.230
and she'll never forgive you.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.875
The saboteur entered this junction...

23:09.000 --> 23:12.117
and deliberately overloaded
this EPS waveguide.

23:12.280 --> 23:14.316
That junction's supposed to be
off-limits.

23:14.440 --> 23:17.000
-The intruder alarms were disabled.
-How?

23:17.200 --> 23:21.478
There's only one way I know of:
by running a high-level diagnostic scan.

23:22.280 --> 23:26.751
Commander Tucker initiated a scan
30 minutes before the overload.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.835
Who ordered you
to sabotage the cloak?

23:36.960 --> 23:38.234
I didn't!

23:43.440 --> 23:46.910
Reed, I'll kill you when I get out of this!

23:47.040 --> 23:48.632
I'd like to see you try.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.279
I checked the records.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.908
Admiral Black recommended you
for Chief Engineer.

23:53.040 --> 23:56.032
He insisted
Forrest replace his own man with you.

23:56.440 --> 23:59.159
You're working for the Admiral,
aren't you?

23:59.800 --> 24:01.597
What have you told him?

24:03.280 --> 24:06.078
Captain, you've got it all wrong.

24:11.800 --> 24:12.835
It wasn't me!

24:12.960 --> 24:15.599
-What have you told him?
-Please, Captain.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.430
I've always been loyal to you!

24:26.800 --> 24:28.028
Break him.

24:42.880 --> 24:46.111
It hasn't been that good in a long time.

24:49.440 --> 24:52.352
The things a girl will give up
for her career.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.478
The data I gave you...

24:58.600 --> 25:01.194
did you transmit it to the Fleet Admiral?

25:03.120 --> 25:04.439
Of course.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.399
What was it?

25:07.480 --> 25:08.993
Insurance policy.

25:16.400 --> 25:19.472
-What's wrong?
-Tucker's a competent engineer.

25:20.440 --> 25:24.228
If he wanted to damage the cloak,
he could have done a much better job.

25:24.520 --> 25:28.229
It couldn't have been easy
with T'Pol looking over his shoulder.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.148
Computer, locate Commander T'Pol.

25:36.920 --> 25:40.276
Unable to comply.
Internal sensors are off-line.

25:41.680 --> 25:44.353
The sensors were damaged
by the overload.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.073
What's going on?

25:48.880 --> 25:50.108
Stay here.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.154
-I wondered what was keeping you.
-I needed time to find help.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.269
No alarm?

26:26.400 --> 26:29.517
I've disabled the internal sensors
and the comm system.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.876
We'll take the Bridge first.

26:55.720 --> 26:58.359
Set a course out of Tholian space,
maximum warp.

27:00.560 --> 27:03.233
-I can't alter our heading.
-Full stop!

27:05.480 --> 27:07.357
The helm's not responding.

27:09.400 --> 27:10.833
Having trouble?

27:13.440 --> 27:14.839
You did this.

27:15.360 --> 27:19.717
Autonavigation can't be released until
we've reached the coordinates I've set.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.676
Restore the controls now.

27:24.800 --> 27:28.588
I can't. They've been encrypted
with a random code.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.037
Can you override the helm?

27:32.160 --> 27:34.674
It'll take several days
to break the encryption.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.678
We'll arrive at the coordinates
long before then.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.915
The Bridge is yours, Captain.

27:51.880 --> 27:55.111
Ten hours in the Booth. Impressive.

27:57.160 --> 27:58.832
Get him out of there.

28:06.640 --> 28:08.198
Bring Major Reed.

28:08.880 --> 28:12.156
I want him to spend some time
in this invention of his.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.515
You gonna shoot me now...

28:16.400 --> 28:18.356
or wait for court-martial?

28:20.520 --> 28:23.273
Fleet Admiral Gardner's
ordered you released.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.511
He received the data you sent him.

28:25.640 --> 28:29.269
The Admiral finds
your suggestion intriguing.

28:30.760 --> 28:32.796
Since you've already locked us
on this course...

28:32.920 --> 28:35.992
I've been ordered to investigate
your mystery ship.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.999
You betrayed me.

28:43.760 --> 28:46.797
Don't think for one moment
I'm going to forget that.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.799
Get cleaned up.

28:50.920 --> 28:53.639
You're briefing the senior staff
in an hour.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.272
A parallel universe.

29:03.640 --> 29:06.552
The Science Directorate has examined
all of these theories.

29:06.680 --> 29:10.070
They've found no evidence
of alternate realities.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.715
The Tholians are a little more
open-minded than your people.

29:14.960 --> 29:18.236
They detonated
a tricobalt warhead here...

29:18.400 --> 29:20.868
inside the gravity well of a dead star.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.355
The explosion created
an interphasic rift...

29:23.480 --> 29:26.040
a doorway into another universe.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.799
-A doorway.
-The rift was unstable.

29:28.920 --> 29:31.354
It was too dangerous
to send one of their own ships through.

29:31.480 --> 29:34.631
So they transmitted a distress call
into the opening...

29:34.760 --> 29:38.958
hoping to lure a ship from the other
side. Their plan worked brilliantly.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.031
How did you learn all this?

29:42.280 --> 29:45.716
The Tholians rely on outside labourers.
Humanoids.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.795
Some of them can be bought
for the right price.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.036
I hope you didn't pay too much.

29:51.840 --> 29:55.628
My contact transmitted these images
before his signal was jammed.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.436
You can barely see anything.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.955
Computer, enhance grid 3-alpha.

30:06.920 --> 30:08.319
An Earth ship?

30:09.480 --> 30:11.311
According to some theories...

30:11.440 --> 30:14.876
everything that exists in our universe
should also exist there.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.709
Another Terran Empire?
Another Starfleet?

30:19.400 --> 30:22.312
So what? How does this help us?

30:22.760 --> 30:25.274
The Tholians quantum dated
a piece of the hull.

30:25.400 --> 30:28.631
This ship is not only from another
universe, it's from another time.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.876
About 100 years into the future.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.753
Imagine the technology we can find
on that ship.

30:33.880 --> 30:36.917
New tactical systems,
advanced bio-weapons...

30:37.040 --> 30:39.679
engines that can reach speeds
we can only dream of.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.950
All of it ours for the taking.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.076
This is ludicrous, Captain.

30:44.200 --> 30:47.670
Someone has fabricated this evidence
to lure us here.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.839
Commander Archer is guilty
of assault and mutiny.

30:50.960 --> 30:51.995
That's enough, Commander.

30:52.120 --> 30:55.430
-Sir, I believe we should--
-I said shut up! We're investigating this.

30:55.560 --> 30:57.596
Get that cloaking device working.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.870
The Captain wants a progress report.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.151
I'll need another minute
to calibrate the field converters.

31:15.960 --> 31:19.191
I spent four hours in the Booth
because of you.

31:19.320 --> 31:22.118
Perhaps you should direct your anger
at Commander Archer.

31:22.240 --> 31:25.277
You disabled the alarms in that junction
and made it look like I did it.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.595
-You're mistaken.
-The hell I am.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.399
I think I'd remember
if I had sabotaged the ship!

31:30.520 --> 31:32.158
Not necessarily.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.558
What did you do to me?

31:35.880 --> 31:40.112
I lured you away from Engineering
with the promise of a sexual encounter.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.158
My mind to your mind.

31:44.320 --> 31:48.279
Once we were alone in my quarters,
I implanted a telepathic suggestion.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.197
My thoughts to your thoughts.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.788
I compelled you
to sabotage the power grid.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.637
After you completed the assignment,
we melded again.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.038
I altered your memory
of what had happened.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.788
It was my duty to help Captain Forrest
regain command.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.275
You're gonna regret what you did.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.752
Threats are illogical.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.319
Engineering to Bridge.

32:12.440 --> 32:14.032
-Go ahead.
-We're ready.

32:14.800 --> 32:18.076
I'm gonna have to channel everything
except auxiliary power.

32:19.080 --> 32:20.399
Engage the cloak.

32:49.080 --> 32:52.993
We've reached the coordinates.
Autonavigation has disengaged.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.796
Let's see where we are.

33:04.840 --> 33:06.831
Magnify the moon on the far right.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.998
Primary systems are off-line,
including life support.

33:35.120 --> 33:38.510
We're reading 13 bio-signs, all alien.

33:39.040 --> 33:43.158
One of them appears to be reptilian.
They're clustered in this section.

33:43.840 --> 33:47.355
-Any sign of the crew?
-We've detected no human signatures.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.351
It's likely the crew was executed.

33:49.480 --> 33:53.189
Look at the size of those coils.
I'll bet that thing could do warp 7.

33:53.320 --> 33:55.595
We'll send an assault team aboard.

33:56.840 --> 33:59.354
You brought us here, you lead it.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.799
Download whatever you can
from the database.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.952
Then destroy the ship.

34:05.240 --> 34:06.514
Destroy it?

34:08.360 --> 34:10.032
We have to take the ship with us.

34:10.159 --> 34:12.958
It's too dangerous.
We are deep in Tholian space.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.958
-Sir, you can't do this.
-You have your orders!

34:18.080 --> 34:19.353
Dismissed.

34:27.280 --> 34:28.599
Go with him.

34:29.880 --> 34:32.757
I don't want Archer to return
from this mission.

34:33.080 --> 34:35.355
Do I make myself clear, Commander?

34:55.840 --> 34:58.195
Someone's removed these components.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.997
They're gutting the ship.

35:07.360 --> 35:08.429
Human.

35:21.760 --> 35:24.593
If you like, sir, I could hold that for you.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.990
Naptime isn't over yet.

35:46.240 --> 35:49.516
I'm picking up a transmission.
It's coming from Decon.

35:49.760 --> 35:50.954
Bridge to Phlox.

35:51.080 --> 35:53.878
-What's happening down there?
-The sedative is no longer working.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.753
-Then kill it, now!
-With pleasure.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.315
Three ships are moving
towards our position.

36:07.440 --> 36:10.034
-Doctor?
-A few more seconds, Captain.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.112
Will you kindly die?

36:19.040 --> 36:20.439
Phlox to Bridge.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.832
You won't be having any further trouble
from our guest.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.788
One of the Tholian ships is hailing us.

36:40.120 --> 36:41.712
This must be the Captain.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.792
His neck's broken.

36:45.640 --> 36:48.518
We should be able
to overload the reactor from here.

36:48.680 --> 36:49.999
Get started.

36:52.360 --> 36:53.839
Four more ships.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.951
Contact Archer.
T ell him to abort the mission.

36:56.080 --> 36:59.038
-Lay in a course out of here.
-They're jamming us.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.708
Target the nearest ship. Fire!

37:27.560 --> 37:28.754
No damage.

37:29.520 --> 37:31.670
Torpedo launchers, fire when ready.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.279
They can see us.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.078
Get us out of here.

37:47.880 --> 37:51.714
Engineering, disengage the cloak
and transfer all power to engines.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.197
Cloak's not responding, sir.

37:57.680 --> 38:00.717
-How much longer?
-Maybe you'd like to take a stab at it.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.956
I can activate their systems.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.275
-Stand aside, Commander.
-Almost there.

38:23.160 --> 38:24.832
Enterprise is under attack.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.033
Hull plating's down.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.633
We've lost power on Decks C, D, and E.

38:32.760 --> 38:35.558
Engineering to Bridge.
The containment fields are failing.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.477
Can you vent the antimatter?

38:38.600 --> 38:41.160
Negative. Reactor breach
in three minutes.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.718
This is the Captain.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.759
All hands to escape pods.
Abandon ship.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.512
You heard my order!

38:58.280 --> 39:02.239
-What do you think you're doing?
-I'll buy you as much time as I can.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.118
Get out of here, now.

39:15.080 --> 39:17.355
Enterprise is taking heavy damage.

39:18.960 --> 39:21.110
Can you bring weapons
and engines online?
