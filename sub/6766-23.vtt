WEBVTT

00:02.669 --> 00:04.933
And how are you
and Tara getting along?

00:04.971 --> 00:06.632
Good.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.197
Good.

00:08.241 --> 00:10.869
Yesterday, we were
discussing Colin.

00:10.910 --> 00:13.401
I'd like to hear more.

00:13.446 --> 00:17.542
Like I told you,
we were in love,

00:17.584 --> 00:21.179
and, um, when he
started using again,

00:21.221 --> 00:23.655
it just seemed natural
that I join in,

00:23.690 --> 00:25.351
especially after
my father dumped me.

00:25.392 --> 00:26.825
Hmm.

00:26.860 --> 00:30.091
Do you think you started using
because of Colin or your father?

00:30.130 --> 00:31.995
Both, I guess.

00:32.031 --> 00:37.698
I mean, the coke was
in my drawer because of Colin,

00:37.737 --> 00:42.299
but I never would have
even thought of using it

00:42.342 --> 00:44.674
if it hadn't been
for my dad leaving.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.406
So the two men you
were counting on

00:46.446 --> 00:47.913
kind of left you high and dry,

00:47.947 --> 00:49.744
didn't they?

00:52.552 --> 00:56.318
But when I really look
at the whole thing,

00:56.356 --> 01:00.019
I realize that...

01:00.126 --> 01:02.754
I can only blame myself.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.525
How do you feel about them now?

01:06.332 --> 01:09.062
Well, where my father
is concerned,

01:09.102 --> 01:11.969
I've been through this
before with him,

01:12.005 --> 01:15.031
and, um, that's just
the way he is.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.304
I guess
maybe now it's...

01:17.343 --> 01:20.312
it's a little easier
to accept that.

01:22.048 --> 01:24.676
And I feel sort
of sorry for him.

01:26.619 --> 01:28.985
But I'll...
I'll always love him.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.488
How about Colin?

01:33.493 --> 01:35.461
I don't know.

01:37.297 --> 01:38.855
There's something about Colin

01:38.898 --> 01:43.926
that I'm really drawn to,
you know?

01:43.970 --> 01:45.961
There's something about him

01:46.005 --> 01:50.408
that just sort
of takes control over me.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.001
Do you like that?

01:57.083 --> 01:58.983
Yeah, I do.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074

03:22.135 --> 03:24.262
Good morning.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.518
I bet you'll never guess

03:47.560 --> 03:49.494
what happened
20 years ago today.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.121
Sergeant Pepper taught
the band to play?

03:51.164 --> 03:52.961
Enough with the Beatles
already, please.

03:52.999 --> 03:54.261
No.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.861
20 years ago, my mother
had the insight to buy a bond

03:57.904 --> 04:00.532
for her tow-headed,
blue-eyed baby boy.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.269
And now, it's matured.

04:04.544 --> 04:07.775
Too bad we can't say the
same for the baby boy.

04:07.814 --> 04:10.044
So, uh, how much
is the bond worth?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.311
20 grand.

04:11.351 --> 04:12.943
A grand a year.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.647
So, you gonna reinvest?

04:15.855 --> 04:19.120
Silver, some windfalls
are meant to be spent.

04:19.158 --> 04:21.524
Expensive jewelry for
the one you adore

04:21.560 --> 04:22.892
is always a
really good idea.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.863
Yeah.

04:24.897 --> 04:27.331
It's a leap year...
February 29 is coming up.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.527
Sadie Hawkins Day.

04:28.568 --> 04:29.535
So?

04:29.569 --> 04:31.594
So, it's a tradition.

04:31.638 --> 04:34.573
Every leap year, the
smarter, fairer sex

04:34.607 --> 04:36.074
gets to call the shots.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.701
Sadie's very clear
on that point.

04:37.744 --> 04:39.075
Sadie this.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.975
What, you're gonna spend
20 grand on a motorcycle?

04:43.082 --> 04:44.379
- Hey.
- I don't think so.

04:44.417 --> 04:45.816
It's not just a motorcycle,
it's a Harley.

04:45.852 --> 04:46.978
It's a classic, okay?

04:47.053 --> 04:48.953
Investments don't
become any more solid.

04:48.988 --> 04:49.977
Tell her, Silver.

04:50.056 --> 04:51.853
Hey, guys.

04:51.891 --> 04:53.415
- Hey, Val.
- Hey.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.756
Hey. Uh,
why don't you join us?

04:54.794 --> 04:57.194
I-I can't, I've got
to go work at the club.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.061
- See you later.
- Bye.

05:02.001 --> 05:03.764
Damn, I can't stand it.

05:03.803 --> 05:04.929
Stand what?

05:05.004 --> 05:06.801
The way she looks,
the way she smells.

05:06.839 --> 05:09.774
It's gonna drive me crazy
the rest of my life.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.334
You're the one that
broke up with her.

05:12.378 --> 05:14.209
Yeah, well, it still hurts.

05:17.350 --> 05:18.442
I gotta get to class.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.644
Hey, wait,
don't forget...

05:19.686 --> 05:21.381
we're going
bike shopping later.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.685
I'll be there.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.461
You know, uh, maybe
while you're drooling

05:29.495 --> 05:31.656
over the little Harleys,

05:31.698 --> 05:33.325
you should tell David
what you think

05:33.366 --> 05:34.663
is going on between
her and Colin.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.601
I don't even know
if that's true.

05:36.636 --> 05:39.104
And where is Brandon
when you need him?

05:39.138 --> 05:41.766
Ah, yes, nothing like
the clean ocean air

05:41.808 --> 05:43.935
and a three-day weekend.

05:43.976 --> 05:45.773
Would you mind
putting up this top, please?

05:45.812 --> 05:48.679
I mean, it's making
a mess out of my hair.

05:48.715 --> 05:51.843
I think it looks kind of sexy.

05:51.884 --> 05:54.352
Thank you, but, uh,

05:54.387 --> 05:55.979
my mother doesn't like sexy.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.249
She likes neat.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.451
Wait a minute,
why are you nervous?

05:59.492 --> 06:00.891
We're going to see your parents.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.326
I'm the one
that should be nervous.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.727
Are you nervous?

06:03.763 --> 06:05.230
No.

06:05.264 --> 06:06.663
You should be.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.098
What are you talking about?

06:08.134 --> 06:09.931
I'm a hero.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.901
As far as they're concerned,
I saved their daughter

06:11.938 --> 06:14.031
from certain death
on a mountaintop.

06:14.073 --> 06:17.736
I really wouldn't bring
that up if I were you.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.404
You didn't tell them?

06:19.445 --> 06:21.470
Uh...

06:21.514 --> 06:24.642
no, and, uh, if they
ever found out,

06:24.684 --> 06:26.948
I'd be forbidden from skiing,

06:27.019 --> 06:28.577
much less seeing you.

06:28.621 --> 06:31.715
They sound a little, uh,
overprotective.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.658
Well, wouldn't you be?

06:33.693 --> 06:34.887
I mean, their oldest daughter

06:34.927 --> 06:37.191
goes out for a jog
and doesn't come home.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.131
I mean... truth of the matter

06:40.166 --> 06:41.861
is I really haven't
been home much

06:41.901 --> 06:43.835
since Kathryn died.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.361
It must be tough.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.169
Yeah.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.473
So, uh, have you been
to California before?

06:56.516 --> 06:58.507
Recruiting trip
to USC once.

06:58.551 --> 07:00.382
Decided to stay back
at Penn State instead.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.888
I still say that's
where Joe should have gone.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.484
Uh, what time did Joe
say he'd meet us?

07:07.527 --> 07:09.859
Uh, he should be here real soon.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.730
Oh, this is Nat,
he owns the Peach Pit.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.735
This is Hank, Joe's brother
from Pittsburgh.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.669
Hey, any brother of Joe's...

07:18.704 --> 07:20.194
He's a hell of a ballplayer.

07:20.239 --> 07:21.638
Yeah, yeah, we're
real proud of him.

07:21.674 --> 07:23.198
Yeah, we are, too.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.208
Joseph.

07:26.245 --> 07:27.337
Hey, big brother.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.439
Missed you.

07:29.482 --> 07:31.609
Hey, I missed you, too.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.050
I can't believe
I still recognize you.

07:33.085 --> 07:34.211
Don't come home
for Thanksgiving,

07:34.253 --> 07:35.413
you don't come home
for Christmas...

07:35.455 --> 07:36.547
Right, right, come on, man.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.750
Not in front of Donna, huh?

07:41.027 --> 07:42.654
So, how'd it go?

07:42.695 --> 07:44.390
Well, they still have
to evaluate everything,

07:44.430 --> 07:46.261
but the nurse thinks
I'm gonna be a shoo-in.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.493
Oh, that is so great.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.194
So, you're gonna
go ahead with this thing

07:49.235 --> 07:51.100
without bothering to talk
to the family about it?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.331
Well, hey,
I'm talking to you.

07:52.371 --> 07:53.838
That's why I asked you
to come here.

07:53.873 --> 07:55.670
Well, I'm telling you
I'm not so sure

07:55.708 --> 07:57.972
it's such a good idea for you
to continue playing ball,

07:58.010 --> 08:00.376
operation or not.

08:00.413 --> 08:03.075
You know, Hank,
I had the exact same reaction

08:03.115 --> 08:04.548
when I first heard
about all this.

08:04.584 --> 08:05.881
Donna, excuse me.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.579
Um, I know you mean well,

08:07.620 --> 08:10.646
but, um, I think this
is really a family matter.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.282
Hank, Donna's been
through this

08:12.325 --> 08:14.293
with me every step of the way.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.022
Her father's a cardiologist.

08:16.062 --> 08:18.360
But, with all
due respect, Donna,

08:18.397 --> 08:20.558
you're not family,

08:20.600 --> 08:21.931
and you don't mind if a couple

08:22.034 --> 08:23.433
of long lost brothers
spend some time

08:23.469 --> 08:24.458
catching up, do you?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.802
- Hank.
- No, Joe, that's okay.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.602
Sure, I don't mind.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.950
Don't worry, I'll talk to him.

08:38.049 --> 08:41.383
Hank can be a bit
bullheaded sometimes.

08:41.419 --> 08:43.615
He was a linebacker, you know.

08:43.655 --> 08:44.918
Okay.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.619
Just, uh, come by
the apartment later, okay?

08:47.660 --> 08:49.685
See you in a bit.

08:57.770 --> 08:58.930
Oh, wait a minute.

08:58.971 --> 09:00.370
- Just stand here for a second.
- What?

09:00.406 --> 09:01.430
What? What are you doing?

09:01.474 --> 09:03.101
Nothing, I'm just...

09:03.142 --> 09:05.269
Okay.

09:08.581 --> 09:10.105
Hello.

09:10.149 --> 09:11.810
I'm home.

09:14.086 --> 09:16.646
Mom, Dad, I'm home.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.754
Hi, Hamlet!

09:21.794 --> 09:22.920
Susie.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.053
Good boy.

09:24.096 --> 09:25.290
Hi, hi, Daddy.

09:26.332 --> 09:27.321
Um...

09:27.366 --> 09:29.527
- Oh, Dad, this is Brandon.
- Hi.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.093
How are you doing, Mr. Keats?
Nice to meet you.

09:31.137 --> 09:32.764
- Hi.
- Whoa!

09:32.805 --> 09:33.863
- Hamlet.
- Hello.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.498
- Hi, Hamlet.
- Hi, Hamlet.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.133
- Hamlet.
- Hamlet.

09:37.176 --> 09:39.667
Hamlet, go!

09:39.712 --> 09:41.179
My, uh,

09:41.213 --> 09:42.703
mother's the only one
he'll listen to.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.840
Yes.

09:43.883 --> 09:46.113
Too bad my children were
never quite as obedient.

09:47.153 --> 09:48.882
Darling.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.479
Hi, Mom.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.753
Well, don't you look beautiful.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.453
Uh, is... is
you hair lighter

09:54.493 --> 09:55.892
or is it darker?
I can't tell.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.395
No, no, it's just the same.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.761
Ah, so it is.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.631
Well, I guess I'm just
not used to seeing it so, um...

10:01.667 --> 10:04.431
Go ahead, Mom, say it... messy?

10:04.470 --> 10:07.530
No, I was going
to say carefree.

10:07.573 --> 10:09.370
Actually, that's my fault,
I-I had the top down.

10:09.408 --> 10:10.841
Forgive me.

10:10.876 --> 10:11.968
You must be Brandon.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.944
Yes, I am,
you must be Mrs. Keats.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.140
Ruth, please.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.910
Gerald and I
are not formal people.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.746
Uh, Gerald, why don't you show

10:18.784 --> 10:20.115
Brandon the downstairs bedroom.

10:20.152 --> 10:21.642
- Mom.
- What?

10:21.687 --> 10:22.984
lt... don't worry, dear.

10:23.022 --> 10:24.990
We redid the entire room.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.217
Brandon will be
very comfortable.

10:26.258 --> 10:27.691
Long as he doesn't mind the dog.

10:27.727 --> 10:28.989
Oh, no, sir.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.359
He doesn't snore, does he?

10:31.731 --> 10:32.823
Come on, Brandon.

10:32.865 --> 10:34.594
- Let's let these two catch up.
- All right.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.900
He's quite handsome.

10:38.938 --> 10:41.304
You usually go for the
more intellectual type.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.706
Well, he's smart, too, Mom.

10:43.743 --> 10:46.007
Uh-huh, I'm sure.

10:46.045 --> 10:48.240
Mom, please don't start.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.577
What?

10:49.615 --> 10:51.014
From everything
you've told me,

10:51.117 --> 10:55.019
this boy just seems
too good to be true.

10:55.087 --> 10:57.851
I mean, he's...
he's not perfect.

10:57.890 --> 11:00.222
That's all I'm saying.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.292
I don't want to hear
another word.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.825
- Just put it on.
- Are you sure?

11:10.870 --> 11:12.201
Of course, I'm sure.

11:12.238 --> 11:14.069
You're always saying you're
so cold in the cafeteria.

11:14.106 --> 11:15.164
Thanks.

11:15.207 --> 11:16.674
I've never felt anything
so soft before.

11:16.709 --> 11:17.698
What is it?

11:17.743 --> 11:18.641
Cashmere.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.272
I've never worn cashmere before.

11:21.313 --> 11:23.281
- Well, enjoy it.
- Thanks.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.952
Come in.

11:26.986 --> 11:28.453
- Hey!
- Hey.

11:28.487 --> 11:30.455
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:30.489 --> 11:31.786
This is my brother, David.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.155
This is my roommate, Tara.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.625
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

11:34.660 --> 11:35.820
That's a beautiful sweater.

11:35.861 --> 11:36.828
Cashmere.

11:36.862 --> 11:37.988
Well,

11:38.064 --> 11:38.996
I'll leave you guys alone.

11:39.098 --> 11:40.588
I have to go get my head shrunk.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.261
Ah, been there,
and done that.

11:43.302 --> 11:44.462
Yeah?

11:44.503 --> 11:46.471
Glad to see we're not
the only crazies.

11:46.505 --> 11:47.494
Yeah.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.531
See you later.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.011
Well, at least
you lucked out

11:53.079 --> 11:54.569
in the roommate
department.

11:54.613 --> 11:56.012
Yeah, she's cool.

11:56.115 --> 11:57.912
And believe me,

11:57.950 --> 12:00.578
there's nothing in my life
that I can complain about

12:00.619 --> 12:02.951
after hearing
her problems.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.317
So, how you been
holding up?

12:04.356 --> 12:05.948
I'm doing okay.

12:06.025 --> 12:07.492
How's everything
on the outside?

12:07.526 --> 12:09.494
Ah, same old thing.

12:09.528 --> 12:12.861
Actually, Steve got
himself a Harley.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.058
You're kidding?

12:14.100 --> 12:15.863
- No, I was with him today.
- Oh, my...

12:15.901 --> 12:16.890
Clare must've freaked.

12:16.936 --> 12:19.564
Actually, she doesn't know yet.

12:19.605 --> 12:21.232
Well, between you and Donna,

12:21.273 --> 12:24.071
I've heard the low down on
everyone except one person.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.577
And who's that?

12:25.611 --> 12:27.169
Colin.

12:27.213 --> 12:30.649
I just want to know like
how he's doing,

12:30.683 --> 12:32.150
how he's handling the break up.

12:32.184 --> 12:33.310
Make sure he's staying clean.

12:33.352 --> 12:36.378
Actually, I don't really know.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.549
You haven't heard from him?

12:38.591 --> 12:40.582
Or talked to him or anything?

12:40.626 --> 12:43.060
No, not really.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.394
So you do know something.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.424
Well,

12:50.469 --> 12:52.437
I heard it from Steve.

12:52.471 --> 12:54.132
You know Steve...

12:54.173 --> 12:55.538
- Look, just forget about it.
- What?

12:55.574 --> 12:57.405
David, I want you
to tell me, all right,

12:57.443 --> 12:58.603
I care about him.

13:00.646 --> 13:03.080
Yeah, well, maybe you shouldn't.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.845
What?

13:09.722 --> 13:11.189
Kel...

13:11.223 --> 13:12.884
he's seeing Valerie.

13:18.230 --> 13:19.925
What?

13:33.512 --> 13:35.309
Believe me,

13:35.347 --> 13:37.338
that's exactly
how I feel about it.

13:43.856 --> 13:45.847
It's okay.

14:01.974 --> 14:04.408
Well, Mrs. Keats, this certainly
does look delicious.

14:04.443 --> 14:05.535
Compliment Gerald.

14:05.578 --> 14:06.567
He's the gourmet chef

14:06.612 --> 14:07.579
in this house.

14:07.613 --> 14:08.602
Well, my compliments, Gerald.

14:08.647 --> 14:10.114
Looks fantastic.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.946
This was Susan's sister's
favorite dish.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.544
She just, uh, loved her paella,
didn't she?

14:17.556 --> 14:18.580
Well, dig right in.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.159
I'm so glad

14:21.193 --> 14:22.319
the two of you could come down.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.885
Well, I wanted you
to meet Brandon.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.123
And I wanted to meet you.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.928
Why?

14:27.967 --> 14:29.264
Ruth.

14:29.301 --> 14:30.393
Well, I'm sorry,

14:30.436 --> 14:32.427
it seems like an appropriate
question to me.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.803
Just how serious are things
between you?

14:34.840 --> 14:36.637
Mother, can we at least
get through the main

14:36.675 --> 14:38.666
course before the interrogation
begins.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.679
No, no, it's all right,

14:40.713 --> 14:42.305
it's all right.
I have nothing to hide.

14:42.348 --> 14:44.282
I'm not a criminal.

14:44.316 --> 14:46.477
I never even invested
in Whitewater.

14:47.586 --> 14:48.985
So besides being a journalist,

14:49.088 --> 14:50.555
you're also a comedian.

14:50.589 --> 14:52.113
And he's

14:52.157 --> 14:54.421
a Democrat, so let's get
that out of the way.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.257
Oh, I promised Gerald
we would not discuss politics

14:56.295 --> 14:57.785
or religion this evening.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.923
So that leaves sex
and television.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.194
What's the matter, Mother?
No Shakespeare?

15:03.235 --> 15:04.497
Going soft?

15:04.536 --> 15:07.437
My mother is
a Shakespearian scholar.

15:07.473 --> 15:10.169
Usually Ruth likes to give
little pop quizzes

15:10.209 --> 15:11.506
to the girls' suitors.

15:11.543 --> 15:14.671
Well, I'm afraid you got me
there, Mrs. Keats.

15:14.713 --> 15:17.614
I don't know Macbeth
from McDonald's.

15:19.551 --> 15:21.815
lf, uh, you're looking for

15:21.854 --> 15:23.822
his resume, it's a good one.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.654
Brandon was student body
president his sophomore year.

15:26.692 --> 15:28.717
That's all well and good,

15:28.761 --> 15:31.355
but all I want to know is

15:31.397 --> 15:33.388
are you sleeping
with my daughter?

15:33.432 --> 15:34.228
Ruth!

15:34.266 --> 15:36.166
No, mother. We're not.

15:36.201 --> 15:37.429
Good.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.477
It's not often

15:46.512 --> 15:49.481
you can see this many
stars in the city.

15:49.515 --> 15:51.745
You know what this
reminds me of?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.411
What?

15:53.452 --> 15:55.420
Sweden.

15:55.454 --> 15:56.978
Sweden?

15:57.022 --> 15:59.320
Yeah, remember when our
tour bus broke down

15:59.358 --> 16:00.655
and we had to
sleep outside,

16:00.693 --> 16:02.320
out in the open.

16:02.361 --> 16:04.329
That's kind of a stretch,
isn't it?

16:04.363 --> 16:06.923
If I remember,

16:07.032 --> 16:10.832
the aurora borealis
lit the northern sky...

16:10.869 --> 16:13.929
and the only traffic
you could hear were goats.

16:14.039 --> 16:16.030
Aren't we romantic?

16:18.711 --> 16:21.680
I like where we are right now.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.705
Where are we?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.953
Look, uh,

16:27.987 --> 16:31.115
I heard what you said,

16:31.156 --> 16:34.284
and, uh, I want you to know

16:34.326 --> 16:37.295
that if I'm with you,

16:37.329 --> 16:39.297
I'm with you?

16:39.331 --> 16:41.322
That's it,
that means nobody else.

16:43.335 --> 16:46.304
You really mean that?

16:46.338 --> 16:49.330
Yeah, yeah, I really mean that.

16:55.047 --> 16:56.981
Where are you going?

16:57.082 --> 16:59.744
To bed.

16:59.785 --> 17:01.776
You coming?

17:03.822 --> 17:06.483
You're sure about this?

17:07.526 --> 17:10.324
I'm not sure about anything.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.422
As long as Kelly's out
of the picture,

17:13.464 --> 17:14.727
I don't care anymore.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.948
What's the matter, Kelly?

17:29.982 --> 17:31.950
Everything.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.952
And the coffee sucks.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.783
Come on, what are you
so upset about?

17:35.821 --> 17:38.119
You practically told me
this guy Colin was the devil.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.125
I don't know.

17:40.159 --> 17:41.285
I'm just confused.

17:41.326 --> 17:43.157
You're not confused.
You're just upset

17:43.195 --> 17:45.186
because he's going out
with somebody you can't stand.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.200
Since when did you get so smart?

17:49.234 --> 17:50.633
I'm brilliant

17:50.669 --> 17:52.261
as long as it's your life
we're talking about

17:52.304 --> 17:53.430
and not mine.

17:53.472 --> 17:54.871
I just feel so humiliated.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.898
Like what we had meant nothing
to him.

17:59.344 --> 18:02.006
I should have known that
he would go straight to her.

18:02.047 --> 18:04.015
Kelly, let it go.

18:04.049 --> 18:05.107
He's not worth it.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.778
Yeah,

18:07.820 --> 18:10.914
but every time I close my eyes,
I can see him kissing her,

18:10.989 --> 18:13.549
and it tears me up inside.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.362
You know what it makes me
want to do?

18:19.398 --> 18:21.366
A big fat line?

18:21.400 --> 18:23.368
No.

18:23.402 --> 18:26.428
It makes me want to kill her.

18:30.709 --> 18:32.700
Kelly.

18:40.252 --> 18:41.879
Hi.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.888
Hey, good-lookin'.

18:43.922 --> 18:45.389
How'd it go?

18:45.424 --> 18:46.448
With Hank?

18:46.492 --> 18:47.618
Went fine.

18:47.659 --> 18:49.126
Just talked
about old times.

18:49.161 --> 18:50.458
You know, growing up stuff,

18:50.496 --> 18:52.623
throwing the football
in the yard with my old man.

18:52.664 --> 18:55.633
Well, what did he think
about the operation?

18:55.667 --> 18:58.659
Uh, he's not sure.

18:58.704 --> 19:01.673
Right, well, I mean,
that's understandable.

19:01.707 --> 19:04.005
I mean that's why
we checked it out so thoroughly.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.839
You know, and I-I
talked to my dad,

19:05.878 --> 19:07.175
and he said he would love

19:07.212 --> 19:09.407
to explain the whole procedure
to Hank in detail.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.439
I'm not sure Hank's
quite ready for that.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.451
How was your day?

19:15.487 --> 19:17.478
Joe.

19:17.523 --> 19:21.653
Look, you can't let Hank's
pessimism get to you.

19:21.693 --> 19:25.686
We are so lucky to have the
program even consider you.

19:25.731 --> 19:27.858
This is what we've
been praying for.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.367
Yeah.

19:29.401 --> 19:31.392
I know.

19:35.574 --> 19:39.567
But... you've changed
your mind, right?

19:42.114 --> 19:44.241
You're backing out?

19:44.283 --> 19:47.252
Donna, I have to listen
to my family.

19:47.286 --> 19:50.255
Hank's just looking
out for me.

19:50.289 --> 19:52.257
How can you say that?

19:52.291 --> 19:53.656
He won't even listen.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.284
He doesn't even know what
he's talking about.

19:55.327 --> 19:57.318
He knows exactly
what he's talking about.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.829
He's been down that road before.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.195
He blew out his knee

20:00.232 --> 20:02.063
the second to last game
of his senior year.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.398
Pro scouts were already watching
him for the draft.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.768
The doctors told him
they could perform miracles.

20:06.805 --> 20:08.796
He got his hopes up.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.205
Three surgeries,

20:10.242 --> 20:12.233
nothing worked.

20:12.277 --> 20:15.405
He just doesn't want the same
thing to happen to me.

20:20.018 --> 20:22.987
So does that mean you have
to stop playing football, too?

20:23.021 --> 20:25.888
You know,

20:25.924 --> 20:27.255
I think you're just afraid

20:27.292 --> 20:28.623
of being better
than your brother.

20:29.928 --> 20:32.158
And I think he likes it
that way.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.776
It sure is good to have
you home, Susan.

20:44.810 --> 20:46.778
It means a lot to your mother.

20:46.812 --> 20:48.643
It's good to be home, Dad.

20:48.680 --> 20:49.669
I never thought this

20:49.715 --> 20:52.013
empty nest thing
would catch up to us,

20:52.050 --> 20:54.848
but the years go fast.

20:56.888 --> 20:58.549
Dad, are you ever gonna
change Kathryn's room?

20:58.590 --> 21:00.581
Well, that's the way
your mother likes it.

21:00.626 --> 21:03.959
I don't have the heart
to say anything about it.

21:04.029 --> 21:05.826
It's depressing.

21:05.864 --> 21:07.092
I know.

21:07.132 --> 21:08.656
It depresses me, too,
sometimes.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.964
But for your mother
it's a sanctuary.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.435
Don't make a big thing about it.

21:12.471 --> 21:13.495
It would upset her.

21:13.538 --> 21:15.972
It's just, it's not healthy.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.134
I know.

21:17.175 --> 21:18.904
Just let it be.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.775
Well,

21:20.812 --> 21:22.279
time for me to hit the sack.

21:22.314 --> 21:23.611
Good night.

21:23.649 --> 21:24.946
- Good night, Mr. Keats.
- Night, Dad.

21:24.983 --> 21:26.951
Good night.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.783
So, do you, um, always lie
to your parents?

21:33.058 --> 21:34.855
What would you rather
I'd done?

21:34.893 --> 21:37.862
I'd just rather you would
have said something.

21:37.896 --> 21:39.864
You're right, I'm sorry.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.868
To tell you the truth,

21:43.902 --> 21:45.199
I was a little embarrassed

21:45.237 --> 21:47.865
that your mother was so
cool about everything.

21:47.906 --> 21:49.533
I didn't quite know
how to tell you

21:49.574 --> 21:52.543
about my parents.

21:52.577 --> 21:54.545
They don't, uh,

21:54.579 --> 21:56.547
think you're a...

21:56.581 --> 21:58.549
- virgin?
- No.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.551
I made a mistake
of telling them

22:00.585 --> 22:02.382
about the abortion.

22:02.421 --> 22:03.547
Ouch.

22:03.588 --> 22:04.885
How'd they deal with that?

22:04.923 --> 22:07.084
Uh, not very well.

22:07.125 --> 22:10.117
Especially since Kathryn
had just died.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.653
That's why I lie now.

22:14.132 --> 22:16.600
Well, I'm sorry about that,

22:16.635 --> 22:20.469
but, um... in the future,

22:20.505 --> 22:23.497
would you do me a favor
and fill me in?

22:31.683 --> 22:33.981
- Tell you what.
- What?

22:34.019 --> 22:37.750
Why don't you go down
to the guest bedroom

22:37.789 --> 22:42.283
and I'll go upstairs
to my room, and, um,

22:42.327 --> 22:44.557
we'll wait for the parentals
to fall asleep

22:44.596 --> 22:46.826
and then you'll sneak up.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.833
What do you say?

22:48.867 --> 22:50.494
Well, all righty.

22:54.639 --> 22:56.470
- Come on. Come on.
- No, I'm not getting on it.

22:56.508 --> 22:58.874
- All right, I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

22:58.910 --> 23:00.343
It's freezing, okay? I'm not
going anywhere on that thing.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.505
It's not freezing.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.570
Are you scared?

23:04.649 --> 23:05.911
So what if I am?

23:05.951 --> 23:07.782
There's nothing
to be scared about.

23:07.819 --> 23:09.286
Come on, this is
a great motorcycle.

23:09.321 --> 23:10.515
I know what I'm doing.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.451
Fine. Fine.

23:15.494 --> 23:16.654
Kill me.

23:17.763 --> 23:19.253
Hold on.

23:21.266 --> 23:23.530
- You on?
- Yeah, I'm on.

23:43.288 --> 23:46.655
Milwaukee iron,
not bad, huh?

23:46.691 --> 23:47.988
No, it was great.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.323
Thanks.
I'm done now. Bye.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.852
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

23:52.964 --> 23:54.659
But I was thinking
that maybe we could take

23:54.699 --> 23:56.530
a, you know, a cruise up
the coast tomorrow.

23:56.568 --> 23:57.728
What do you say?

23:57.769 --> 23:59.737
I say... no way,

23:59.771 --> 24:01.295
not in a million years.

24:01.339 --> 24:03.034
I just paid a lot of money
for that motorcycle,

24:03.074 --> 24:04.268
and you don't even
want to ride it with me?

24:04.309 --> 24:05.936
Nope. I hate it.

24:06.044 --> 24:07.443
You didn't even
give it a chance.

24:07.479 --> 24:08.605
I just did.

24:08.647 --> 24:10.114
I got that for us.

24:10.148 --> 24:11.172
I thought you'd love it.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.446
Well, I don't.

24:13.485 --> 24:15.248
Sorry to destroy any fantasies

24:15.287 --> 24:17.687
you may have had
of me as a biker chick, Steve.

24:17.722 --> 24:20.282
I wish I'd known this before.

24:20.325 --> 24:22.259
- You didn't ask.
- I didn't ask?

24:22.294 --> 24:24.694
No. Have a good ride.

24:24.729 --> 24:25.957
Bye.

24:26.064 --> 24:27.531
You've got to be kidding me?

24:27.566 --> 24:29.261
Clare, are you serious?

24:29.301 --> 24:31.292
Yep, bye, honey. Love you.

24:32.337 --> 24:33.804
Pick me up tomorrow.

24:33.839 --> 24:35.830
In your car!

25:07.806 --> 25:09.740
Hamlet.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.000
Good evening, um...

25:15.213 --> 25:17.477
Sit.

25:19.217 --> 25:21.481
Stay, heel, down.

25:23.221 --> 25:25.917
Uh, uh, uh,
"To be or not to..."

25:27.359 --> 25:30.123
"Whether 'tis nobler to suffer

25:30.161 --> 25:31.389
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune."

25:35.634 --> 25:37.829
Good boy.

25:38.970 --> 25:41.632
That a boy.

25:41.673 --> 25:43.664
Good boy.

25:59.524 --> 26:00.991
Hello.

26:01.026 --> 26:02.857
Have I told you today
how terrific you are?

26:02.894 --> 26:05.328
Yeah, about five times...

26:05.363 --> 26:07.092
starting from the minute
I woke up.

26:07.132 --> 26:08.394
What are you doing right now?

26:08.433 --> 26:09.695
What do you think I'm doing?

26:09.734 --> 26:10.723
I'm changing my clothes.

26:10.769 --> 26:12.100
When am I going
to see you again?

26:12.137 --> 26:14.230
You're crazy, you know that?

26:14.272 --> 26:15.534
Yeah, I know.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.201
So I guess
I'll see you at dinner.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.766
Hey, don't be late.

26:18.810 --> 26:20.471
I won't. I won't.

26:20.512 --> 26:21.945
You know last night, Valerie,

26:22.047 --> 26:23.309
it was really beautiful.

26:23.348 --> 26:24.315
Thank you.

26:24.349 --> 26:26.214
Yeah, it was.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.343
I'll see you later.

26:27.385 --> 26:29.285
Yeah, bye.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.966
Hey.

26:42.067 --> 26:44.092
Home for the holidays?

26:44.135 --> 26:46.695
What holidays?

26:46.738 --> 26:48.171
Leap year.

26:48.206 --> 26:50.106
You don't think I'd forget
a bud on leap year do you?

26:50.141 --> 26:53.201
What do you want, Danny?

26:54.579 --> 26:55.910
I brought something

26:55.947 --> 26:58.677
guaranteed to make your
heart spin a little faster.

27:00.852 --> 27:02.581
No, man.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.555
Did you hear me before?

27:04.589 --> 27:05.681
I'm trying to get straight.

27:05.724 --> 27:08.056
This stuff's
not to be missed, man.

27:11.529 --> 27:13.520
Huh?

27:16.968 --> 27:19.163
Go straight next week.

27:27.178 --> 27:29.112
I can get a bulk deal
on this stuff,

27:29.147 --> 27:31.081
but it's a today-only thing.

27:31.116 --> 27:33.414
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:33.451 --> 27:36.113
So do me a favor.

27:36.154 --> 27:38.179
- I need a ride.
- Where?

27:38.223 --> 27:39.850
Torrance or something.

27:39.891 --> 27:42.519
"Torrance"?

27:42.560 --> 27:43.720
What happened to your car?

27:43.762 --> 27:46.287
Oh, too many parking tickets.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.764
It's parked outside my house
right now

27:47.799 --> 27:49.232
with one of them, uh,
them boots on the wheels.

27:49.267 --> 27:51.235
No, man, I...

27:51.269 --> 27:53.294
- No, I don't know, man.
- All right, tell you what.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.932
You give me a ride,
the gram's yours.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.539
Huh?

28:01.579 --> 28:02.568
Come on.

28:02.614 --> 28:04.514
You and Danny V
on the highway.

28:09.287 --> 28:11.414
Hi, hon.
Are the kids up yet?

28:11.456 --> 28:13.924
No, I don't think so.

28:13.958 --> 28:17.587
Well, I'm going
upstairs to wake up Susan.

28:17.629 --> 28:18.687
I wouldn't mind spending

28:18.730 --> 28:20.755
just a little time
alone with her.

28:20.799 --> 28:23.927
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

28:31.142 --> 28:33.167
Susan, wake up.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.645
It's 10:00
and it's a beautiful day.

28:37.982 --> 28:40.177
Morning, Mom.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.881
I beg your pardon.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.532
Oh, my God!

28:54.566 --> 28:55.760
- What are you doing here?!
- What?

28:55.800 --> 28:57.199
You were supposed to go
back to your room.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.795
- Oh, man, I fell asleep.
- Oh, come on.

28:59.838 --> 29:01.465
Get up. We're in trouble.

29:01.506 --> 29:03.497
My mom just caught us.

29:15.954 --> 29:17.319
Good morning.

29:17.355 --> 29:19.084
Morning.

29:19.124 --> 29:21.115
Morning, you two.

29:25.630 --> 29:27.598
Well, Brandon,
would you like some eggs?

29:27.632 --> 29:29.497
Oh, yeah, thanks.

29:29.534 --> 29:31.593
- Uh, coffee?
- Yeah, please.

29:32.637 --> 29:34.730
You can turn around now, Mom.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.206
It's not like we committed

29:36.241 --> 29:37.936
one of the seven deadly sins.

29:37.976 --> 29:39.944
Oh, really?

29:39.978 --> 29:42.947
Last I checked,
lust was on the list.

29:43.014 --> 29:45.448
Ruth, lighten up.

29:45.483 --> 29:46.950
You know how I feel about this.

29:47.051 --> 29:49.884
You willfully ignored me
in my own home.

29:49.921 --> 29:50.945
That is disrespectful.

29:51.055 --> 29:52.716
I'm sorry.

29:52.757 --> 29:53.917
And so you should be.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.425
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Keats...

29:55.460 --> 29:57.189
No. Thank you, Brandon.

29:57.228 --> 29:58.923
I am disappointed in Susan.

30:01.499 --> 30:03.467
How come when Kathryn
had a boyfriend,

30:03.501 --> 30:04.968
you didn't stop her
from sleeping with him?

30:05.003 --> 30:07.699
That was different.

30:07.739 --> 30:09.138
She was engaged.

30:09.174 --> 30:11.438
And how dare you bring
Kathryn's name into this?

30:11.476 --> 30:12.465
You let her rest in peace.

30:12.510 --> 30:14.478
I'm trying to.

30:14.512 --> 30:16.139
Why can't you?

30:18.650 --> 30:19.981
- Susan...
- Come on, Dad.

30:20.084 --> 30:21.676
You know it's true.

30:21.719 --> 30:24.119
All the rules have changed
since Kathryn died, Mom.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.385
I'm still alive.

30:26.424 --> 30:28.915
She isn't.
I can't change that.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.894
You turned my room

30:30.929 --> 30:33.295
into some kind
of part-time office

30:33.331 --> 30:35.356
and her room
is some kind of shrine.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.027
How do you think that
makes me feel?

30:45.210 --> 30:46.302
I'm sorry, Mom.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.335
I just... I can't take it
anymore.

30:53.384 --> 30:56.444
- I better go talk to her.
- Uh, no, no, Brandon.

30:56.487 --> 30:58.785
No, just, uh...

30:58.823 --> 31:00.484
I know my daughter,
just let her be.

31:02.026 --> 31:04.256
She needs to cool
down right now.

31:08.499 --> 31:10.660
To tell you the truth,
she's right.

31:14.339 --> 31:16.569
I-I'm sorry if we were rude
in front of you.

31:16.608 --> 31:19.133
No, no, no, not at all.

31:22.347 --> 31:23.939
You see one of the
worst things

31:23.982 --> 31:26.507
a human being can go through
is losing a child.

31:30.855 --> 31:33.323
Kathryn's gone.

31:37.262 --> 31:39.423
I surely don't want
to lose Susan.

31:44.535 --> 31:46.526
I will go up
and I'll talk to her.

31:52.710 --> 31:55.804
Trouble is,
they're exactly alike.

31:55.847 --> 31:59.112
Kathryn was like me, and Susan's
just like her mother.

31:59.150 --> 32:01.482
Well, Susan's been under
a lot of pressure lately.

32:02.820 --> 32:04.310
I think she's having
a tough time

32:04.355 --> 32:05.879
living up to Kathryn's memory.

32:07.492 --> 32:10.017
This is the best thing
that could have happened.

32:13.064 --> 32:14.497
Kel?

32:14.532 --> 32:15.760
Hi.

32:15.800 --> 32:19.065
- Hey.
- Please, come on in.

32:19.103 --> 32:20.968
- Hi.
- How's it going?

32:21.039 --> 32:23.064
Don't ask.
That's what my shrink's for.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.507
- That good, huh?
- Don't listen to her.

32:25.543 --> 32:26.510
She's fine.

32:26.544 --> 32:27.806
- Hi, Tara.
- Hi.

32:27.845 --> 32:29.972
Oh, this is my other
roommate, Clare.

32:30.048 --> 32:31.743
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.614
- Where shall I put this?
- What you got there?

32:33.651 --> 32:36.279
Something wicked we smuggled
in from the Peach Pit.

32:36.321 --> 32:39.757
Oh... ooh, peach pie.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.089
Hey, break it out.
It's not all for you.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.321
Oh, all right,
here you go.

32:44.362 --> 32:45.693
Dig in.

32:47.031 --> 32:48.999
Forks.

32:49.033 --> 32:51.001
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

32:51.035 --> 32:53.162
So your old friend,
Steve, has completely,

32:53.204 --> 32:54.432
totally lost his mind.

32:54.472 --> 32:57.373
Yeah, David told me
he bought a motorcycle.

32:57.408 --> 32:59.000
Yeah. And he expects me
to ride on it.

32:59.043 --> 33:01.238
Like that'll
ever be happening.

33:01.279 --> 33:02.940
So, Donna,
what's Joe's brother like?

33:03.014 --> 33:05.278
Uh, well, he's
kind of like Joe.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.307
Except without the dreams.

33:07.352 --> 33:09.252
Having a party?

33:09.287 --> 33:11.118
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were we too loud?

33:11.155 --> 33:12.952
Not by me.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.185
Um, Greg,

33:14.225 --> 33:15.817
these are my friends
Donna and Clare.

33:15.860 --> 33:18.260
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:18.296 --> 33:19.729
Dr. Browning wanted me
to let you know

33:19.764 --> 33:21.561
your group session
has been moved to 10:15, okay?

33:21.599 --> 33:24.227
- Okay, great.
- It was nice to meet you all.

33:24.268 --> 33:26.964
You, too.

33:27.038 --> 33:28.869
Any more

33:28.906 --> 33:29.964
like him around?

33:30.074 --> 33:31.564
Yeah, my mom always told
me to marry a doctor.

33:34.278 --> 33:35.506
Oh, you know what?

33:35.546 --> 33:36.774
I'm late, I got to go.

33:36.814 --> 33:38.645
I got to meet the carpet-
cleaning guy at the apartment.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.742
- Sorry.
- Tell him to clean my room.

33:40.785 --> 33:41.911
I will.

33:41.953 --> 33:43.614
And I, uh, got to go
meet Joe and his brother.

33:43.654 --> 33:44.621
See you tomorrow?

33:44.655 --> 33:45.622
- Yeah?
- Okay, thanks for coming.

33:45.656 --> 33:46.714
Bye, see you later.

33:46.758 --> 33:47.952
- Thanks for the pie.
- Nice to meet you.

33:47.992 --> 33:49.118
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.957
- Bye, Tara.
- Bye.

33:54.832 --> 33:56.800
You have really great friends.

33:56.834 --> 33:58.131
Mm.

33:58.169 --> 34:01.036
So, uh,
you got room for one more?

34:01.072 --> 34:03.063
Sure.

34:13.217 --> 34:16.482
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:16.521 --> 34:17.487
Thanks for meeting me.

34:17.522 --> 34:19.547
No problem.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.956
This place is a little empty
on the weekend.

34:22.025 --> 34:23.755
Yeah, well, everyone's
at the beach, you know.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.319
Three-day weekend, so...

34:31.369 --> 34:34.463
Look, I was a little off base
with you yesterday.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.302
Sorry.

34:36.340 --> 34:37.568
It's all right.

34:37.608 --> 34:39.098
I appreciate your concern,
you know.

34:39.143 --> 34:42.078
Thanks.

34:42.112 --> 34:45.378
You know, if Joe never
played another down again,

34:45.416 --> 34:47.281
that would suit
me just fine.

34:47.318 --> 34:49.616
Then, why are you pushing him
into this thing?

34:49.654 --> 34:51.382
Why are you pushing him
away from it?

34:51.422 --> 34:52.980
I don't think
my little brother should risk

34:53.091 --> 34:55.252
experimental heart surgery
just to play football.

34:55.293 --> 34:56.521
I mean, it's a great game.

34:56.561 --> 34:57.528
Believe me, I know.

34:57.562 --> 34:59.996
I grew up with it, too.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.065
So I heard.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.066
But I knew

35:02.100 --> 35:04.034
it would have to end
sooner or later,

35:04.068 --> 35:06.127
and I want to make sure
he has a later.

35:08.172 --> 35:11.505
Well, if that's it,
then I can respect that,

35:11.542 --> 35:13.567
but I, I don't think it is.

35:15.079 --> 35:19.345
Now, Hank, you can tell me
to mind my own business,

35:19.383 --> 35:21.442
but I think you're glad
this happened to Joe...

35:21.486 --> 35:23.386
'cause now he'll never go

35:23.421 --> 35:26.413
any further in football
than you did.

35:52.016 --> 35:53.847
I got this for you.

35:53.885 --> 35:55.352
I even had it personalized.

35:55.386 --> 35:57.115
Hmm.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.554
Did you get us, uh,

35:58.589 --> 36:02.423
personalized adjoining
cemetery plots, too?

36:02.460 --> 36:04.018
Look, Clare,
this is your last chance.

36:04.061 --> 36:06.291
I'm laying it on the
line right here.

36:06.330 --> 36:07.524
And what's that supposed
to mean?

36:07.565 --> 36:09.965
It means ride with me
or I ride alone.

36:14.071 --> 36:16.767
Fine.

36:16.807 --> 36:18.399
Nadine, will you watch my stuff
for me?

36:18.442 --> 36:19.773
I'll be right back.

36:19.810 --> 36:20.777
You're going to love it.

36:20.811 --> 36:22.039
When I crank that accelerator,

36:22.079 --> 36:24.479
you're going to know
why women love Harleys.

36:24.515 --> 36:26.915
Ah, Clare, living
dangerously.

36:26.951 --> 36:28.475
Hey, hey,
why don't you shut up

36:28.519 --> 36:29.645
before she changes her mind?

36:29.687 --> 36:32.451
Why don't you take David
for a ride? Here.

36:32.490 --> 36:35.050
Because the thought of
David's arms wrapped around me

36:35.092 --> 36:38.425
and his hot breath on my neck
doesn't exactly appeal to me.

36:38.462 --> 36:40.726
Let's hurry up, all right,
before I'm sick.

36:41.999 --> 36:43.523
Ah, just keep your eyes
closed, Captain Kirk.

36:43.568 --> 36:45.092
It makes it a lot easier.

36:45.136 --> 36:46.103
- Hey, Nat.
- What?

36:46.137 --> 36:47.229
You seen Valerie?

36:47.271 --> 36:50.365
Uh, she should be in
the office, doing the books.

36:56.414 --> 36:58.575
Hi, David,
come in, sit down.

36:58.616 --> 37:00.413
No, thanks, I'm
not staying.

37:00.451 --> 37:03.477
Oh, then
this is a friendly visit.

37:03.521 --> 37:06.149
It sure didn't take
you long, did it?

37:06.190 --> 37:09.023
Long for what?

37:09.060 --> 37:11.824
To jump on Colin.

37:11.862 --> 37:15.696
Listen, David,
with all due respect,

37:15.733 --> 37:17.064
you have no say in this.

37:17.101 --> 37:20.798
You're right.

37:20.838 --> 37:22.772
I just wanted
to warn you about him.

37:22.807 --> 37:25.207
He, uh, drug Kelly down
and he'll drag you down, too.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.770
Well, I think I'm a little bit
stronger than Kelly.

37:28.813 --> 37:30.940
You're just full of confidence,
aren't you?

37:31.015 --> 37:33.245
Yeah.

37:33.284 --> 37:34.717
David, are you through?

37:34.752 --> 37:38.620
- Yeah. - Good,
'cause I got to get going.

37:45.496 --> 37:48.226
Oh, my God.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.733
Ah, you're squeezing
me too tight.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.359
You're cutting off
my circulation.

37:51.402 --> 37:52.596
No more turns!

37:52.637 --> 37:53.968
- Come on, come on.
- I'm scared, okay.

37:54.071 --> 37:55.197
It feels like
we're going to fall.

37:55.239 --> 37:56.263
Well, we're not.

37:56.307 --> 37:59.276
Just, just become
part of the bike.

37:59.310 --> 38:00.368
Lean with me.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.576
See, that wasn't
so bad, was it?

38:06.617 --> 38:08.847
No, it felt good.

38:08.886 --> 38:10.285
Good.

38:10.321 --> 38:13.381
Now, give me some attitude and
let's get in the wind, mama.

38:13.424 --> 38:14.448
Whoo!

38:15.760 --> 38:18.593
Whoo!

38:21.799 --> 38:23.767
Wake up, Susan,
we're almost home.

38:26.404 --> 38:27.928
Brandon, I'm so tired.

38:27.972 --> 38:31.601
Well, it was a very
emotionally draining weekend.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.542
I'm sorry you had to go
through all that with me.

38:36.580 --> 38:39.105
I just feel bad for your mom.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.449
I think she went through
more than any of us.

38:42.486 --> 38:43.885
She is a nice lady, though.

38:43.921 --> 38:47.254
Yeah, she is.

38:47.291 --> 38:50.954
You know, um...
after that talk we had,

38:51.062 --> 38:54.395
I, I realize how much
she really cares for me.

38:56.434 --> 38:59.164
I really can't be
so hard on her anymore.

38:59.203 --> 39:01.865
Or on yourself.

39:03.874 --> 39:06.741
I wish you didn't have
to go home so soon.

39:06.777 --> 39:08.335
I want to show you L.A.

39:08.379 --> 39:09.346
Next time, little brother.

39:09.380 --> 39:10.347
Yeah.

39:10.381 --> 39:11.348
I wish I could stay longer,

39:11.382 --> 39:12.872
but, you know, I got
to get back to work.

39:12.917 --> 39:14.817
Listen, I want you
to know that...

39:14.852 --> 39:16.820
the family's not going
to stand in the way

39:16.854 --> 39:19.618
of anything you want to do.

39:19.657 --> 39:21.716
Neither am I.

39:21.759 --> 39:23.852
Thanks, Hank.

39:23.894 --> 39:25.088
I guess if there was something

39:25.129 --> 39:26.153
they could have done
with my knee,

39:26.197 --> 39:27.687
I'd still be playing ball, too.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.661
Excuse me.

39:32.703 --> 39:35.831
Hi, it's right here.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.272
Donna, it was a pleasure
meeting you.

39:37.308 --> 39:38.866
You, too.

39:38.909 --> 39:40.536
Joe has one hell
of a big brother.

39:40.578 --> 39:42.705
Yeah, thanks.

39:42.747 --> 39:44.772
Get him to bring you
to Beaver Falls some time.

39:44.815 --> 39:46.282
He's got a couple
of little nieces

39:46.317 --> 39:48.615
that would really take
a liking to you.

39:48.652 --> 39:49.949
I'd like that.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.646
Listen, we better
get you out of here

39:51.689 --> 39:52.883
or you're going to
miss that flight.

39:52.923 --> 39:55.551
I love you, kid.

39:55.593 --> 39:57.788
I love you, too.

40:03.134 --> 40:05.068
I'll be back in a flash.

40:05.102 --> 40:07.536
- All right.
- Enjoy yourself.

40:09.573 --> 40:12.235
Who loves you?

40:42.506 --> 40:44.997
Damn, I got coke on me.

41:19.009 --> 41:21.375
When police raided
an alleged drug house...

41:21.412 --> 41:23.073
Mm, Nadine, check it out.

41:23.113 --> 41:24.307
L.A.'s finest are at it again.

41:24.348 --> 41:27.249
Cool, another high-speed chase.

41:27.284 --> 41:28.376
Hey, better than the soaps.

41:28.419 --> 41:31.388
...and he seems
to be alone in the car.

41:31.422 --> 41:33.652
No one appears
to have been hurt,

41:33.691 --> 41:36.251
but, again,
all we can do at this time

41:36.293 --> 41:37.988
is speculate.

41:38.095 --> 41:40.791
The suspect is weaving
through freeway traffic,

41:40.831 --> 41:42.628
at times at very high...

41:53.244 --> 41:55.712
...truck while turning
on to Foundry Road.

41:55.746 --> 41:59.375
As you can tell, the police
remain in hot pursuit,

41:59.416 --> 42:01.407
and the chances of escape
appear...

42:01.452 --> 42:02.544
Hey, Val, get in here.

42:02.586 --> 42:03.575
You got to see this.

42:03.621 --> 42:04.713
I'm on my way out, guys.

42:04.755 --> 42:05.722
What's the big deal?

42:05.756 --> 42:07.553
Just watch.

42:07.591 --> 42:08.956
Well, I'm late. I have a date.

42:09.059 --> 42:10.583
With who?

42:10.628 --> 42:11.959
Hey, doesn't this look
like Colin's van?

42:12.062 --> 42:13.893
The van continues to move in

42:13.931 --> 42:16.297
and out of traffic
as more police vehicles

42:16.333 --> 42:17.300
have joined this pursuit.

42:17.334 --> 42:18.426
Well, there's got to be

42:18.469 --> 42:20.733
like 50,000 vans like
that in this city.

42:20.771 --> 42:23.171
Now, I'm going to try and take
a pass to get another look,

42:23.207 --> 42:26.973
as the van is headed down
the off-ramp.

42:29.513 --> 42:32.778
The squad car has now plowed
into the rear of the van,

42:32.816 --> 42:34.408
causing it to spin out
into a 180.

42:34.451 --> 42:38.444
That looks an awful
lot like Colin's van.

42:38.489 --> 42:40.548
The Colin?

42:40.591 --> 42:41.888
Yeah, the Colin.

42:41.926 --> 42:43.359
The van is surrounded

42:43.394 --> 42:45.225
- with absolutely nowhere to go.
- I think it is.

42:45.262 --> 42:46.388
Could be stolen.

42:46.430 --> 42:48.295
That's probably
why the police are chasing it.

42:48.332 --> 42:50.994
We can only hope
that this man is not armed.

42:51.101 --> 42:54.696
Once again, the police
and highway patrol have managed

42:54.738 --> 42:56.000
to overtake the van,

42:56.040 --> 42:59.009
as this high-speed chase
has come to a stop.

42:59.043 --> 43:00.738
Put your hands up
where I can see them.

43:00.778 --> 43:03.611
We'll switch now to
our ground camera at the scene.

43:03.647 --> 43:04.944
That's Colin, all right.

43:05.049 --> 43:07.711
The suspect appears to have
surrendered without a struggle,

43:07.751 --> 43:08.945
- and he's being placed...
- My God.

43:08.986 --> 43:11.716
...under arrest.

43:11.755 --> 43:14.952
Turn around, put your hands up.

43:15.025 --> 43:17.425
Oh, my God, it is him.

43:17.461 --> 43:18.826
...he was alone in the van,

43:18.862 --> 43:21.626
and, fortunately,
no one has been hurt.

43:21.665 --> 43:22.723
Put your hands behind you.

43:22.766 --> 43:24.324
We will stay on the scene
to bring you

43:24.368 --> 43:27.531
any new details
about this wild chase

43:27.571 --> 43:31.974
that has taken over
the streets of L.A.

43:32.009 --> 43:34.375
You still love him, don't you?

43:35.379 --> 43:37.347
I don't know.

43:37.381 --> 43:39.747
Once again, the police
and highway patrol have managed

43:39.783 --> 43:41.410
to overtake the van,

43:41.452 --> 43:45.855
as this high-speed chase
has come to a stop.

43:45.889 --> 43:46.878
You understand these rights?

43:47.925 --> 43:51.520
We have no information
as of this time

43:51.562 --> 43:55.293
on the suspect involved
in this high-speed chase.

43:55.332 --> 43:57.892
We do know that it began
in Torrance

43:57.935 --> 44:00.870
when police raided an alleged
drug house and tried to stop...
