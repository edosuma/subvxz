00:22.312 --> 00:26.532
_

00:46.972 --> 00:49.947
- He says he won't see you.
- He won't see me? Why not?

00:56.420 --> 00:58.265
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:58.779 --> 01:00.339
What are you doing?

01:00.853 --> 01:02.460
Iâm watching you sleep.

01:02.580 --> 01:04.660
Is that something that you do a lot?

01:06.700 --> 01:08.540
From time to time.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.620
I didnât know that.

01:16.431 --> 01:18.180
Well thatâs because...

01:19.261 --> 01:20.773
... youâre asleep.

01:21.940 --> 01:23.019
Not anymore!

01:24.139 --> 01:25.940
You made me breakfast.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.060
Well, Patrice made you breakfast.

01:28.180 --> 01:30.553
But I carried it up the stairs...
and I have to tell you it

01:30.673 --> 01:33.056
- was extraordinarily heavy!
- My hero!

01:33.420 --> 01:36.260
Unfortunately I canât
join you. I've got...

01:36.420 --> 01:38.779
- ... got to go to work.
- What! No, why?

01:38.940 --> 01:41.700
I have to go to work and
you have to go to New York.

01:54.694 --> 01:55.779
Hey!

01:57.300 --> 01:59.019
Thanks for making me breakfast.

_

03:18.779 --> 03:20.394
What is money?

03:20.514 --> 03:21.946
What is money?

03:22.066 --> 03:25.586
Why do we covet it so? Money,
money, money, money, money.

03:26.832 --> 03:30.461
_

03:48.139 --> 03:50.460
What is money? Come on!

03:52.458 --> 03:56.378
_

03:58.660 --> 04:00.774
Sold! At three million dollars.

04:07.460 --> 04:10.820
Oh, it's been too long!
What is a nice surprise.

04:10.940 --> 04:12.260
Are you well... Great.

04:14.401 --> 04:15.973
You want the Malevich?

04:16.093 --> 04:18.810
Well that depends on the
price, donât you think?

04:18.930 --> 04:20.528
Couldn't you just buy him...

04:20.648 --> 04:22.100
... a vineyard instead?

04:22.260 --> 04:24.460
Or a small Pacific island?

04:25.820 --> 04:28.524
There is nothing as rigorous as money...

04:29.300 --> 04:30.820
... nothing as fluid,...

04:30.940 --> 04:32.420
... nothing as tensile.

04:32.540 --> 04:35.940
Money desires nothing
so much as to be itself.

04:36.940 --> 04:39.078
Where is money most itself?

04:48.779 --> 04:50.940
So where you gonna hang it?

04:51.060 --> 04:52.899
It needs special place.

04:53.019 --> 04:54.700
It's very beautiful thing.

04:55.139 --> 04:57.838
Argus and Io. Do you know the story?

04:57.958 --> 05:01.580
Some God fucked a maiden.
Greek kind of thing.

05:02.060 --> 05:03.540
Jupiter fucked Io.

05:03.660 --> 05:05.060
His wife found out.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.660
Everyone fucked everyone then.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.339
Money is most itself in the last...

05:10.500 --> 05:12.259
... unregulated,...

05:12.379 --> 05:14.620
... great, bazaar,...

05:14.740 --> 05:17.379
... the art market.
Where money can do...

05:17.499 --> 05:19.203
... what God intended.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.100
Accumulate.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.460
Various images from
Alice's looking glass,...

05:23.580 --> 05:26.060
... a thing costs what some putative,...

05:26.220 --> 05:28.420
... free spending Mad Hatter...

05:28.580 --> 05:30.597
... says it costs.

05:30.717 --> 05:32.940
A very exciting bid
ladies and gentlemen.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.700
Next we have Lot 12A...

05:36.300 --> 05:38.900
- Will he be bidding?
- Oh no, I doubt it.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.379
Robert Carver is what we call...

05:41.540 --> 05:42.700
... a voyeur.

05:42.900 --> 05:45.220
You do know the nicest people.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.460
From the collection of John Brandeis...

05:48.700 --> 05:49.859
We trade...

05:50.460 --> 05:52.060
Picasso, Rembrandt,...

05:52.220 --> 05:53.700
... Degas, Duchamp.

05:53.859 --> 05:56.139
We bundle them the way
sub primes are bundled,...

05:56.300 --> 05:58.260
... we sell a Warhol short one day,...

05:58.420 --> 06:01.060
... we hedge an Old Master the next.

06:01.220 --> 06:03.740
We get in there before regulation...

06:03.900 --> 06:06.747
... tames the last Wild West.

06:09.339 --> 06:10.580
So...

06:10.700 --> 06:12.432
... were you convinced?

06:23.827 --> 06:26.139
- Him I don't know...
- Rykov.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.500
He's a dealer. Heavy machinery.

06:28.620 --> 06:30.700
Syria, Iraq, Congo. Places like that.

06:30.859 --> 06:33.180
All the places they
need heavy machinery.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.820
And you know all the others.

06:36.580 --> 06:37.859
Excuse me.

06:38.379 --> 06:39.620
- Hi.
- Georgina!

06:39.740 --> 06:42.180
- It's up next.
- The Malevich?

06:42.379 --> 06:45.654
- What's my limit again?
- Did I hear you say Malevich?

06:46.464 --> 06:47.660
It's my wife.

06:51.859 --> 06:55.220
Itâs really stunning, Iâm telling
you this is like the missing link.

06:55.340 --> 06:57.416
Every Russian wants a Malevich.

06:57.536 --> 07:00.180
Every oligarch. Just be one second.

07:00.300 --> 07:03.339
- Where are you?
- Iâm at friend's house in Nice.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.940
Which friends in Nice? Do I know them?

07:07.859 --> 07:10.687
- Are you still there?
- Will it take my breath away?

07:10.807 --> 07:11.980
Absolutely.

07:12.139 --> 07:14.500
Wrong. Only you can do that.

07:14.820 --> 07:16.700
Why does every redundant stock trader...

07:16.859 --> 07:18.540
... been prowling the galleries?

07:18.779 --> 07:20.940
Because they know there is value there.

07:21.139 --> 07:22.700
Ungoverned,...

07:22.940 --> 07:24.620
... unregulated,...

07:25.500 --> 07:26.940
... value.

07:32.462 --> 07:34.712
_

07:37.940 --> 07:39.940
Ladies and gentlemen I shall commence...

07:40.100 --> 07:42.420
... the bidding at fifteen
million dollars.

07:44.779 --> 07:46.260
Fifteen million we have.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.540
- We have sixteen million...
- I've bid sixteen.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.676
When are you coming back?

07:54.220 --> 07:55.859
It's up to twenty.

07:56.660 --> 07:58.780
Why donât you come back tonight?

07:58.900 --> 08:01.974
- You know how badly I sleep alone.
- Are you even listening to

08:02.094 --> 08:04.820
a word I'm saying? What is my limit?

08:04.940 --> 08:06.859
Itâs gonna go to twenty three.

08:09.533 --> 08:10.586
Hello?

08:10.706 --> 08:13.220
All this drama, it's bad
for my blood pressure.

08:14.844 --> 08:17.565
Twenty-five now, ladies
and gentlemen. On the floor,

08:17.685 --> 08:19.574
- it gets you on the phone sir.
- It's like a feeding frenzy.

08:19.694 --> 08:21.598
Can we go to thirty?

08:22.460 --> 08:23.940
Can we go to thirty?

08:26.420 --> 08:27.779
Tino, sweetheart.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.700
I canât hear you.

08:32.820 --> 08:34.659
My love, you know I
trust you implicitly.

08:34.900 --> 08:37.460
- Can I go to thirty?
- Thirty.

08:37.580 --> 08:39.940
On the floor, thirty.
Thirty million dollars,...

08:40.059 --> 08:42.068
... ladies and gentlemen.

08:42.900 --> 08:45.260
Hello? Hello?

08:50.335 --> 08:52.936
Fair warning... at
thirty million dollars...

08:55.060 --> 08:57.093
Sold! At thirty million dollars!

09:08.100 --> 09:10.060
Congratulations.

09:12.762 --> 09:14.833
_

09:14.953 --> 09:17.736
_

09:51.662 --> 09:53.609
- Horrible.
- You used to love these.

09:53.729 --> 09:56.180
I didn't know any better.

09:56.858 --> 09:59.398
- You look great.
- So do you.

10:00.180 --> 10:01.700
It's been too long.

10:01.820 --> 10:02.967
It has.

10:04.939 --> 10:07.940
- One more?
- Oh no, I, I have to fly back tonight.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.060
But wonât the private
jet wait for Madame?

10:10.180 --> 10:12.860
You still live in Villefranche,
I could give you a lift.

10:12.980 --> 10:16.060
A lift? Wow! No thank
you, thank you, but...

10:16.220 --> 10:18.580
... I still have business
to attend to here.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.180
Yeah, itâs probably better,
I wouldâve put you in coach.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.659
Thanks! Come on, come on, one more.

10:23.779 --> 10:25.300
Youâre not flying the plane.

10:25.420 --> 10:27.655
- Alright, twist my arm.
- Great.

10:27.775 --> 10:29.620
- Excuse me? Sorry.
- Yes, sir?

10:29.779 --> 10:32.537
- Two more of these, please. Thanks.
- Sure.

10:35.834 --> 10:38.871
Hi, you've reached Constantine
Clios. I'm unavailable right now,

10:38.991 --> 10:41.810
but if you leave a message, I'll
get back to you as soon as I can.

10:41.930 --> 10:44.259
Well sweetheart,
Anderton beat us to the punch.

10:44.379 --> 10:46.660
Maybe next time answer my calls.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.580
Sorry.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.500
Nevermind. Erm,...

10:51.980 --> 10:55.500
... I love you. I'll
call you when I land.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.940
- Talk to me.
- A yacht.

11:15.060 --> 11:18.420
You donât say. But whose yacht?

11:18.540 --> 11:22.580
Alexi Litinov. Constantine
Clios was also on board.

11:22.924 --> 11:24.244
Clios?

11:24.364 --> 11:27.340
Villa Camella? Is that confirmed?

11:27.460 --> 11:29.339
Nothing confirmed a yet, sir.

12:17.949 --> 12:20.379
Thatâs enough,... letâs go.

12:56.060 --> 12:57.339
Madame Clios.

13:16.186 --> 13:19.060
No, no, no,... not again. No...

13:22.540 --> 13:24.460
I'm so sorry,... ?

13:24.794 --> 13:26.500
I'm so sorry.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.620
Havenât you got work to do?

13:35.060 --> 13:37.150
I want you to come home now!

13:39.100 --> 13:41.219
I want you to come home now.

13:41.339 --> 13:43.379
I want you to come home.

13:53.460 --> 13:55.740
How awful.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.339
Sounds better in French.

14:01.859 --> 14:03.377
Itâs your father.

14:03.740 --> 14:04.828
I know.

14:05.397 --> 14:06.580
If itâs true.

14:08.379 --> 14:09.664
Does "she" know?

14:13.700 --> 14:15.023
Whereâs Christos?

15:31.060 --> 15:33.220
Christos, what is going on?

15:37.420 --> 15:38.779
Is it Constantine?

15:40.260 --> 15:41.700
- Yes.
- What happened?

15:41.820 --> 15:43.180
Is he all right? What happened?

15:43.420 --> 15:44.980
He was on a boat...

15:49.220 --> 15:50.987
... there was an accident.

15:58.355 --> 15:59.722
He's dead.

16:03.013 --> 16:04.260
No.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.620
No, no,...

16:05.740 --> 16:07.731
- ... that's not right.
- Georgina.

16:33.146 --> 16:35.095
There's something down there...

16:35.215 --> 16:37.706
- ... on the rocks, see it?
- Yes, I see.

16:43.660 --> 16:45.260
Can you bring us in closer?

16:49.980 --> 16:51.911
She moved,... Sheâs alive.

16:52.031 --> 16:54.339
- Could've been the waves.
- No, she moved.

17:51.339 --> 17:52.460
Georgina.

17:52.580 --> 17:53.820
Adam.

17:57.616 --> 18:00.447
- I cannot...
- Itâs so hard to take in.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.420
Georgie, I missed you.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.644
Irina.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.500
My mother's here.

18:09.580 --> 18:10.900
Here she is.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.899
- Commissioner.
- Yes.

18:54.019 --> 18:57.373
First reports are of some
malfunction in the fuel tank.

18:57.493 --> 19:00.011
We don't know whether
it was accidental yet.

19:00.131 --> 19:02.620
Litvinov's yacht sank
in the main sea lane.

19:02.779 --> 19:05.620
Luckily, there are
protocols in place for that.

19:05.859 --> 19:07.659
For now the investigation

19:07.779 --> 19:10.273
is in the hands... of the
Department of Maritime Affairs.

19:10.393 --> 19:12.619
We'll step in if the findings show...

19:12.739 --> 19:15.606
... anything other than an accident.
Which I'm sure they won't.

19:16.820 --> 19:19.993
- And what about the girl?
- She's still unconscious, no ID yet.

19:22.379 --> 19:24.220
And the Clios family?

19:24.340 --> 19:27.650
It'll look bad if we
don't show our face.

19:28.339 --> 19:29.940
You're right, you should go.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.460
Thank you for offering.

19:38.284 --> 19:40.660
The body was found by
the Police Maritime...

19:40.780 --> 19:42.780
... of the Principauté of Monaco.

19:42.900 --> 19:45.060
For now theyâre keeping
it in their hospital.

19:45.180 --> 19:47.430
It has been identified,
through dental records,...

19:47.550 --> 19:49.746
- ... as the body of your husband.
- No, no

19:49.866 --> 19:52.780
there has to be some mistake.
I spoke to him last night,...

19:52.900 --> 19:55.379
... he wasnât on a boat, he
was at a friend's house in Nice.

19:55.540 --> 19:57.404
Christos... did you talk to him,

19:57.524 --> 20:00.318
- did he say anything about a boat?
- No, but...

20:00.831 --> 20:04.060
- ... that's not to say he wasn't there.
- We are 100% sure,...

20:04.180 --> 20:06.380
- ... Madame.
- It doesn't make sense!

20:06.500 --> 20:07.779
As I said before,...

20:07.940 --> 20:10.460
... we are still waiting
for the report...

20:12.260 --> 20:13.500
I wanna see him.

20:13.940 --> 20:15.779
I'm not sure this is wise, Madame.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.940
I will meet you there in an hour.

20:18.060 --> 20:20.260
- Christos, we should go too.
- Sure.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.100
He was burnt, wasn't he?

20:22.220 --> 20:24.180
He was close to the impact.

20:24.300 --> 20:26.820
Iâve been told the body
suffered significant trauma.

20:26.940 --> 20:28.740
I'm not coming. I don't
want to see him like that.

20:28.900 --> 20:31.060
I want to go see him? Can I go see him?

20:31.220 --> 20:32.752
- No.
- He was my dad.

20:32.872 --> 20:35.027
- I have the right to see him!
- Oh, don't be so stupid of

20:35.147 --> 20:36.647
- course youâre not going!
- Why?

20:36.767 --> 20:38.180
Because he's gonna
look like a burnt piece...

20:38.339 --> 20:40.325
- ... of meat, that's why.
- Christos! Stop it.

20:40.445 --> 20:41.618
Both of you.

20:46.260 --> 20:47.820
Christos?

20:51.808 --> 20:53.860
When you told her, what did she say?

20:53.980 --> 20:56.339
Nothing, really. She...

20:56.459 --> 20:58.820
... didn't want to believe
it. None of us do.

20:58.940 --> 21:00.460
Did she cry?

21:01.540 --> 21:03.460
- No.
- Not one tear?

21:04.180 --> 21:06.019
No. Why?

21:06.139 --> 21:08.380
I thought she would,
her husband just died.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.700
Hello?

21:10.420 --> 21:12.300
Of course, hold on.

21:17.965 --> 21:20.070
Right well Iâm getting the impression...

21:20.190 --> 21:22.961
... that if he wasnât he
wouldnât be considering this...

21:24.060 --> 21:25.379
No, I understand.

21:25.499 --> 21:27.691
I just want you to think it through

21:27.811 --> 21:30.425
- thatâs all. You can.
- I can't though.

21:30.900 --> 21:34.180
I want to see him and I donât
want it to be the last time.

21:36.260 --> 21:37.380
I know.

21:37.500 --> 21:41.139
Stay here with me, Ads.
Trust me, you don't want to go.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.420
Georgie,...

21:53.540 --> 21:55.420
... she says Iâm not allowed to go.

21:55.660 --> 21:56.860
No, it's not...

21:56.980 --> 21:59.060
... that you're allowed or not allowed.

22:00.749 --> 22:02.500
Heâs your father.

22:03.580 --> 22:05.300
Then I should be there!

22:06.580 --> 22:08.940
Is that how you wanna remember him?

22:09.060 --> 22:11.024
Thatâs not what he would want.

22:15.060 --> 22:17.024
I'm going to stay here.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.700
Ok.

22:20.820 --> 22:24.100
- Christos, we should go.
- Yeah, I'll meet you there.

22:59.513 --> 23:02.948
It's odd. But I find myself liking
what you've done to the house...

23:05.779 --> 23:08.019
You can think about that now?

23:08.220 --> 23:09.900
I have to think of something.

23:25.989 --> 23:28.180
- Bonjour Madame.
- Bonjour.

23:28.460 --> 23:30.780
I must leave you in
their care from here.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.580
Youâre not coming with us?

23:33.540 --> 23:35.180
I shall be waiting.

23:43.339 --> 23:44.460
Sorry Iâm late.

23:45.180 --> 23:46.660
Here, take my arm.

24:08.779 --> 24:09.900
Now?

24:22.180 --> 24:23.740
- Oh my God.
- Excuse me.

24:29.620 --> 24:30.859
Christos!

25:13.392 --> 25:16.220
They say marriage ends with divorce.

25:17.740 --> 25:21.155
But with a man as vital
as Constantine Clios,...

25:21.275 --> 25:23.138
... my ex-husband,

25:23.258 --> 25:25.666
nothing ever ends.

25:26.100 --> 25:28.540
He was the best of me,
for many years,...

25:30.300 --> 25:31.974
... and I of him.

25:32.094 --> 25:33.700
He lives on, in his...

25:34.019 --> 25:38.980
... philanthropy, his charitable
work, his art foundation,...

25:39.980 --> 25:41.940
... in his children.

26:10.021 --> 26:11.820
Beautifully expressed, my dear.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.740
Thank you Commissioner Lombardi.

26:13.860 --> 26:17.074
- If I can do anything to help?
- Yeah, you can walk me out of here.

26:17.194 --> 26:19.859
There's only so much
sympathy one can take.

26:30.729 --> 26:33.180
You're coming back to the house, Mother?

26:33.300 --> 26:35.556
- Er, I think not.
- But I need you there.

26:35.676 --> 26:37.721
I know you do, you always need me but...

26:37.740 --> 26:40.020
- ... not today.
- It's your home too.

26:40.379 --> 26:41.940
Is it?

26:46.100 --> 26:48.966
You can come back...
for a while can't you?

26:49.086 --> 26:51.420
You have as much right
to grieve there as her.

26:51.540 --> 26:53.100
I don't actually,...

26:53.220 --> 26:55.460
... but I'll be moving
back in very soon.

26:58.293 --> 27:00.300
There's nothing for her here but...

27:00.460 --> 27:02.528
... the memory of Constantine
and when that sours,

27:02.648 --> 27:05.687
which it most definitely
will, she'll leave.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.616
_

27:18.736 --> 27:21.157
_

27:26.044 --> 27:27.883
There you are.

27:29.060 --> 27:30.900
I came as soon as I heard.

27:31.620 --> 27:33.420
Oh Robert!

27:40.304 --> 27:42.580
I can't sleep in our bedroom,...

27:42.700 --> 27:44.500
... there's too much of him.

27:46.139 --> 27:48.180
Hey, hey. It's gonna be alright.

27:48.740 --> 27:51.220
No, it's not gonna be alright.

27:51.820 --> 27:53.700
Itâs never gonna be alright.

28:00.753 --> 28:02.398
Ok, ok.

28:07.260 --> 28:10.139
- We should go back downstairs.
- Yeah, yeah.

28:15.243 --> 28:17.021
I should go down first though...

28:17.141 --> 28:19.100
... cos you look like shit.

28:20.540 --> 28:22.500
There she is.

28:23.460 --> 28:25.339
Iâll wait for you downstairs, ok?

29:05.379 --> 29:06.980
I tracked that down for him.

29:07.100 --> 29:09.019
The Louvre owns most of them.

29:10.379 --> 29:14.300
Juno Confiding lo to the
Care of Argus, 1660.

29:14.500 --> 29:15.700
How much?

29:15.820 --> 29:18.379
Does it really matter now?

29:20.300 --> 29:22.779
My father always wanted
to own a Lorrain.

29:25.900 --> 29:27.248
Your father?

29:28.100 --> 29:29.339
Excuse me, Madame.

29:29.540 --> 29:30.859
Grigory Litvinov.

29:31.300 --> 29:32.740
I too am mourning.

29:33.580 --> 29:35.620
Alexei Litvinov was my father.

29:37.019 --> 29:39.019
Iâll leave you two to talk.

29:39.540 --> 29:40.980
Excuse me.

29:43.580 --> 29:45.540
So you know what it feels like.

29:45.660 --> 29:47.943
- One can't believe it.
- That such a terrible

29:48.063 --> 29:50.228
- thing has happened
- Yeah.

29:52.300 --> 29:54.762
You know it didn't just happen, right?

29:56.620 --> 29:59.060
- What?
- The explosion.

29:59.180 --> 30:01.149
Somebody did it to us.

30:02.019 --> 30:03.300
To both of us.

30:05.180 --> 30:06.580
Someone very close.

30:07.100 --> 30:09.379
What exactly are you saying?

30:12.139 --> 30:14.139
That whoever did this thing,...

30:16.060 --> 30:17.700
... could well be here.

30:19.584 --> 30:21.220
Donât trust anyone.

30:23.651 --> 30:26.060
You came here to tell me this?

30:26.180 --> 30:27.260
No, Madame,...

30:28.220 --> 30:29.980
... I came to pay my respects.

32:22.859 --> 32:24.130
Are you ok?

32:24.900 --> 32:26.339
I'm in mourning.

32:26.859 --> 32:28.207
Remember?

32:32.527 --> 32:33.940
They come and go.

32:34.060 --> 32:36.779
Christos spends most of
his time in London...

32:36.980 --> 32:39.379
... and Adam lives in
Cap D'Antibes. But...

32:39.540 --> 32:41.540
... they consider this their home.

32:42.139 --> 32:43.700
And your stepdaughter?

32:43.820 --> 32:46.536
She splits her time between
her motherâs and here.

32:47.927 --> 32:49.740
Do you know if your husband...

32:50.180 --> 32:52.339
... was alone when he went to...

32:52.459 --> 32:53.980
... Mr. Litvinov's yacht?

32:54.379 --> 32:55.700
Why do you ask?

32:55.820 --> 32:57.500
A young woman was found.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.060
She had been washed in from the sea...

33:00.260 --> 33:01.660
... near Cap Martin.

33:02.779 --> 33:04.100
A young woman?

33:05.180 --> 33:06.380
Dead?

33:06.500 --> 33:07.779
Unconscious.

33:08.100 --> 33:09.420
Sheâs in hospital.

33:09.778 --> 33:12.039
Do you have any idea who she might be?

33:12.460 --> 33:14.139
She was undressed.

33:16.260 --> 33:17.980
An escort, you think?

33:19.460 --> 33:21.139
How long have you been married?

33:23.339 --> 33:24.500
A year.

33:25.970 --> 33:28.679
Not long enough I think
for him to be scouting...

33:28.799 --> 33:30.397
... a younger version.

33:32.580 --> 33:34.300
I understand your grief.

33:34.871 --> 33:35.940
No,

33:37.019 --> 33:38.100
you do not.

33:39.300 --> 33:40.580
Excuse me.

33:42.819 --> 33:44.139
Can I see her?

33:44.460 --> 33:45.980
This young woman,...

33:46.300 --> 33:47.660
... can I see her?

33:53.420 --> 33:54.980
Where's the guard?

34:02.100 --> 34:04.308
Hey! Stop! Wait here.

34:05.339 --> 34:07.500
Doctor, get in there now!

35:09.220 --> 35:11.106
Can I talk to you?

35:11.598 --> 35:14.980
What the hell is going on?
Did that guy just try to kill her?

Do you recognise her?

35:16.727 --> 35:17.740
No.

35:20.348 --> 35:23.420
Does the name Jakob Negrescu
mean anything to you?

35:23.540 --> 35:24.606
No.

35:25.622 --> 35:28.820
He ferries girls back and
forth to the super-yachts.

35:28.940 --> 35:30.260
Party girls.

35:32.776 --> 35:34.580
Used to work for your husband.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.744
Before your time. As security.

35:39.859 --> 35:42.260
Your husband maintained
residence in Monaco...

35:42.380 --> 35:44.940
No. We live at the Villa Carmella,...

35:45.180 --> 35:46.533
... you know that.

35:46.980 --> 35:49.660
So the address 340
Impasse de Montaigne,...

35:49.940 --> 35:51.580
... it means nothing to you?

35:55.060 --> 35:56.709
What are you saying?

36:00.019 --> 36:01.549
Forgive me, madame.

36:02.019 --> 36:04.260
I shouldnât have
mentioned the apartment.

36:59.233 --> 37:00.515
How cute.

37:06.019 --> 37:07.339
Thanks for coming.

37:10.507 --> 37:11.838
Your speech...

37:11.958 --> 37:14.540
- ... the other day was lovely.
- It was important to me.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.019
I couldn't follow it.

37:16.139 --> 37:17.546
I have never

37:17.666 --> 37:19.940
been one for public displays of emotion.

37:20.060 --> 37:21.660
I'd like to think it wasn't just...

37:21.780 --> 37:23.485
... a public display.

37:23.820 --> 37:25.580
No, I didn't mean to be rude.

37:25.820 --> 37:27.300
Votre Martini, madame.

37:28.620 --> 37:29.700
Merci.

37:32.420 --> 37:33.779
Do you know this girl?

37:34.540 --> 37:35.779
Who is she?

37:36.100 --> 37:37.980
A survivor from the yacht.

37:38.379 --> 37:39.860
A whore?

37:39.980 --> 37:41.283
Possibly.

37:41.403 --> 37:43.379
Is that why you asked to see me?

37:47.620 --> 37:48.740
Let me see.

37:51.980 --> 37:53.540
She's beautiful.

37:53.740 --> 37:55.180
Definitely his type.

37:55.300 --> 37:56.940
Nothing like you really.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.100
I wasn't his type?

37:59.779 --> 38:00.994
Never.

38:01.900 --> 38:04.180
And that's what hurt the most.

38:08.023 --> 38:10.564
Well there mustâve been
something he liked.

38:12.173 --> 38:13.927
I can't decide, you see,...

38:14.580 --> 38:16.380
... how much you knew.

38:16.500 --> 38:19.139
About who, and what, he was.

38:19.740 --> 38:21.300
I'm learning.

38:25.540 --> 38:26.920
Let me help you then.

38:28.420 --> 38:29.940
Ask me a question.

38:30.060 --> 38:31.300
Any question.

38:38.660 --> 38:41.180
340 Impasse de Montaigne.

38:41.806 --> 38:44.322
Does that address mean anything to you?

38:44.940 --> 38:47.100
His pied-a-terre in Monaco.

38:47.220 --> 38:49.259
Or as some would have it, his love-nest.

38:49.379 --> 38:51.580
I had to force the entry codes from him.

38:52.980 --> 38:54.854
He took you there?

38:56.704 --> 38:57.902
No.

38:58.022 --> 39:00.381
So he kept secrets, even from you.

39:05.580 --> 39:08.379
12th floor. Apartment...

39:08.620 --> 39:10.300
... 195.

39:10.500 --> 39:13.489
ID44574.

39:14.276 --> 39:15.740
The entry code.

39:17.220 --> 39:18.940
But maybe he changed it.

39:20.859 --> 39:23.379
But you were so trusting.
Maybe there was no need.

39:59.820 --> 40:01.060
Come on!

40:05.460 --> 40:06.660
Jesus!

40:09.940 --> 40:11.300
Fucking jerk!

40:21.980 --> 40:23.420
What do you want?

40:32.580 --> 40:33.820
Ok.

40:57.100 --> 40:58.732
Do you have a problem?

43:42.569 --> 43:45.351
_

43:45.471 --> 43:48.508
_

43:57.859 --> 44:00.820
Sheâs found the apartment,
how shall I proceed?

44:06.503 --> 44:09.261
I think someone else just came in.

44:31.273 --> 44:32.386
You...

44:33.300 --> 44:35.900
... broke my heart.
