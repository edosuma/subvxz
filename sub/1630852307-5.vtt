WEBVTT

00:12.313 --> 00:13.445
- I'm so sick of you.
- All right. I'm out.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.981
- Bye!

00:15.048 --> 00:16.849
- I knew Storm
before I knew Porsha.

00:16.916 --> 00:20.051
She was a host
in one of my restaurants,

00:20.053 --> 00:21.920
and she got fired.
Shut the (BLEEP) up.

00:21.988 --> 00:23.256
- Don't.
- Oh, Dennis!

00:23.322 --> 00:24.223
- Oh!

00:24.290 --> 00:26.793
- Previously, on
"Porsha's Family Matters"...

00:26.859 --> 00:30.295
- The reason why I'm here
is because of you and Porsha.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.930
- It's nice
to have family around,

00:31.998 --> 00:34.332
but Mama Gina,
she, at some point, got up.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.869
Mama Gina, what you need to do,
is sit on the side.

00:37.937 --> 00:38.871
You should never be invested in

00:38.938 --> 00:41.773
your grown-ass son's
relationship.

00:41.841 --> 00:42.875
- Where is Porsha?

00:42.942 --> 00:44.477
- No, I think this
is all we have.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.013
She's the one that wanted it,
and it's her blended family,

00:47.080 --> 00:48.881
and she's not even here.

00:48.948 --> 00:50.282
- Mama Gina, where your son at?

00:50.349 --> 00:52.218
- He had a guest.
- A female guest?

00:52.285 --> 00:53.418
- Yes.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.292
- You used my abuse
to get to this conversation.

01:00.359 --> 01:01.493
- No, that's not what I did.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.294
- So, I no longer wanna have
this conversation with you.

01:02.361 --> 01:03.429
- No. That's not true.
Y'all did.

01:03.496 --> 01:06.197
- You literally interrupted
when she was talking about

01:06.266 --> 01:10.635
a traumatic situation, Londie.

01:10.703 --> 01:14.640
Yes!
Hi, family.

01:14.707 --> 01:18.811
[laughing]

01:21.714 --> 01:28.653
♪♪

01:30.189 --> 01:34.593
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, boo.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.061
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.262
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.497
- Okay, all white.
- I came with it.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.465
You feel me?
- Okay, Lisa Ray.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.400
[laughing]

01:42.468 --> 01:44.002
- Good morning.
- How was your night?

01:44.070 --> 01:46.004
You missed dinner.
- It was great.

01:46.072 --> 01:47.906
- Hmm.
- How was your night?

01:47.974 --> 01:49.975
- Interesting.
- Interesting.

01:50.042 --> 01:52.010
- What do I do here? Just--
- Just your tailbone on the mat.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.011
- Yes.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.546
- And you want your knees
to be on the ground.

01:54.614 --> 01:55.448
- Okay.

01:55.515 --> 01:59.017
- Okay, you can put your hands
on the floor

01:59.019 --> 02:02.554
and feel your back extend up.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.722
- Come on.
You gotta get here early, man.

02:03.789 --> 02:06.758
You're disturbing our energy.
You gotta get here on time.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.493
- You're supposed to be
breathing, not talking.

02:08.495 --> 02:09.161
- Hmm.

02:09.163 --> 02:13.031
- Now, let's go to cat cow.

02:13.033 --> 02:19.304
Let's go first,
and in this pose.

02:19.372 --> 02:25.111
Now, inhale.
Extend your back.

02:25.178 --> 02:29.414
Inhale.
[laughing]

02:29.416 --> 02:33.719
Now, change your pose.
Let's go to down dog.

02:33.721 --> 02:34.454
- Ooh.
- That's it.

02:34.520 --> 02:35.787
- Y'all should know
this position.

02:35.855 --> 02:36.555
- All the time.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.393
- Stop.
- Stop it.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.061
I'm telling her you said that,
and it's inappropriate.

02:43.063 --> 02:44.062
- She know.

02:44.130 --> 02:46.865
- Raise your arms.

02:46.933 --> 02:48.568
Inhale.

02:48.634 --> 02:53.071
Now, bend and extend your knees.

02:53.073 --> 02:54.874
Arms.

02:54.941 --> 02:57.643
[groans]
[laughing]

02:57.710 --> 03:01.680
And come back.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.215
Oom.

03:03.282 --> 03:07.019
- All: Oom.

03:07.086 --> 03:10.422
- Shalama-lama-I am.

03:10.489 --> 03:12.391
- We lost one.
[laughing]

03:12.458 --> 03:13.825
- Right. He's out.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.894
He's probably asleep.
He likes to sleep.

03:15.962 --> 03:19.364
- I never did yoga, and, uh,
I will honestly pass on it.

03:19.366 --> 03:23.302
We're 'posed to be here
as a family to, I guess, bond

03:23.369 --> 03:24.970
and have activities,
but I'm here.

03:25.037 --> 03:28.073
Where the hell is
Porsha and Simon?

03:28.141 --> 03:30.041
I appreciate yesterday, man.

03:30.109 --> 03:32.110
Y'all had really good intentions

03:32.178 --> 03:33.578
in what we're letting go of.

03:33.580 --> 03:36.048
Today, I am making it
very intentional

03:36.115 --> 03:38.784
just to be more about
putting me first.

03:38.851 --> 03:43.289
Figured that would be
a great opportunity to talk.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.557
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh.

03:49.795 --> 03:51.998
- When I first came into
this situation, I told Porsha,

03:52.064 --> 03:57.869
"Your friends are my friends,"
but that changed fast.

03:57.937 --> 04:00.872
I am not y'all friend.
Y'all are Porsha's friend.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.073
You know what I'm saying?

04:02.075 --> 04:03.675
But thank you, Lauren,
for bringing everybody together.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.610
You-you know,
this attempt was great,

04:05.678 --> 04:07.612
but we're missing
the most important part.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.347
Where is Porsha?
We-- where is Porsha?

04:09.415 --> 04:10.316
- She's here.
- Where?

04:10.382 --> 04:13.151
We've been to meditation.
We've been to yoga.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.486
Where is Porsha?
- I agree.

04:14.553 --> 04:17.022
- Yesterday, we had to--
Oh, let's be intentional.

04:17.024 --> 04:17.757
Porsha get on the mic and say,

04:17.823 --> 04:19.691
"Oh, I'm just here
for my family,"

04:19.759 --> 04:21.093
like she ain't
got no ----in' problem.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.027
- I agree.

04:22.094 --> 04:23.528
- There's no point
for us to be here.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.030
- I don't think she's doing
as much work

04:25.032 --> 04:26.265
as she needs to be doing.
I agree.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.266
- And guess what.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.634
This trip is in vain,
and it's not gonna work.

04:29.702 --> 04:30.635
I-I know Lauren
put this trip together,

04:30.703 --> 04:34.172
but, like, everybody here
is attached to Porsha.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.507
Everybody here ain't
attached to me.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.109
Like, you need to
hold her accountable

04:37.176 --> 04:38.710
to make sure that
this trip is successful.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.847
Otherwise,
I'm shooting down to Tulum.

04:41.849 --> 04:45.518
You gotta do more for P.
Because outside of her world,

04:45.584 --> 04:47.519
she's just a celebrity
to people.

04:47.587 --> 04:49.121
You-you know I'm saying?
I like Simon.

04:49.188 --> 04:50.522
I think he's a really good guy.

04:50.589 --> 04:51.524
- Mm-hmm.

04:51.590 --> 04:53.659
- But I don't even know if
he, like, see Porsha

04:53.726 --> 04:58.464
as not a celebrity,
and that worries me.

04:58.531 --> 05:00.665
- I definitely feel like

05:00.667 --> 05:04.202
I hold my sister accountable
behind doors,

05:04.270 --> 05:06.071
but she's gotta show up better.

05:06.138 --> 05:09.007
I think it may be time for us
to stop coddling her

05:09.075 --> 05:10.376
as much as we do.

05:10.442 --> 05:13.145
She's judged in the public arena
every single day.

05:13.212 --> 05:16.214
It's hard to see people
telling her

05:16.282 --> 05:18.683
she's a stupid bitch,
she's this, she's that,

05:18.751 --> 05:21.020
and then come back
and give her more criticism,

05:21.087 --> 05:22.687
but we know
how she's being attacked

05:22.755 --> 05:23.755
on every front,

05:23.823 --> 05:25.558
so we do have to give her
a little bit more grace

05:25.624 --> 05:27.026
than a normal person, Dennis.

05:27.093 --> 05:28.361
- If we come
all the way to Mexico,

05:28.427 --> 05:32.230
and the person we come here for
ain't doing no work themselves,

05:32.298 --> 05:34.232
this is a--
This is a wasted trip.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.101
- You're not wrong.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.169
- But I will say,
in the beginning,

05:37.236 --> 05:38.236
when you were talking,
you were saying,

05:38.304 --> 05:40.106
"You guys aren't my friends,"
what have you,

05:40.172 --> 05:41.306
we are Porsha's friends.

05:41.374 --> 05:43.441
However, we're gonna be around
each other all the time.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.709
- I just wanted to
clear the air, man,

05:44.711 --> 05:46.211
because I don't want, you know,
nobody walking around

05:46.278 --> 05:47.179
thinking I got
no problem with them,

05:47.246 --> 05:49.514
man, 'cause I don't.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.650
- Do you know
why I wanted an apology?

05:51.652 --> 05:52.418
- You want an apology from who?

05:52.484 --> 05:53.451
Me?
- Yeah.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.485
- I would love to hear
why you want an apology.

05:54.554 --> 05:57.590
- I want an apology simply
because I felt like

05:57.656 --> 06:00.992
you felt like I was trying to be
on some sneaky sh--,

06:00.994 --> 06:02.127
and I really wasn't.

06:02.194 --> 06:04.395
- Bro, because you done
sneaky sh-- in the past, fam.

06:04.397 --> 06:05.330
- What I have done sneaky,

06:05.398 --> 06:08.266
and why couldn't you come
and tell me that?

06:08.334 --> 06:10.869
The last time
I seen Dennis McKinley,

06:10.871 --> 06:12.670
he said he was gonna
beat my ass.

06:12.738 --> 06:13.738
- Oh.

06:13.806 --> 06:18.276
- The whole world know that
I cheated on Porsha

06:18.344 --> 06:19.745
when she was pregnant.

06:23.282 --> 06:26.718
But a year later,
she's workin' at Cru.

06:29.288 --> 06:31.656
We got a lotta Crus.
I got a lot of employees.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.692
When people get hired,
they don't go through me,

06:33.694 --> 06:36.294
and they definitely don't say,
"Hey, by the way,

06:36.362 --> 06:38.529
I had a relationship
with McKinley," right?

06:38.598 --> 06:39.898
That probably wouldn't
get you hired.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.232
Dom comes in and...

06:41.300 --> 06:43.301
he sees the girl there.
What he do?

06:43.303 --> 06:44.369
He goes back and tell Porsha.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.971
That's when we broke up
the second time for real.

06:47.039 --> 06:48.640
I-I don't wanna talk about it
at this table

06:48.707 --> 06:49.641
because I'm out of place, man,

06:49.709 --> 06:51.443
but what I'm just trying to
tell y'all is,

06:51.510 --> 06:52.611
I don't got
no beef wit' y'all, man,

06:52.678 --> 06:53.578
and I appreciate y'all

06:53.646 --> 06:54.613
because y'all (BLEEP) with PJ.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.383
The point of coming here
was to have a better

06:57.450 --> 07:00.318
and healthy relationship
for all of us

07:00.386 --> 07:03.188
for the sake of Porsha and PJ.

07:03.255 --> 07:07.058
The sh-- right now, regardless
if she's in love or not,

07:07.060 --> 07:07.927
the sh-- look crazy.

07:07.993 --> 07:10.429
- But we brought up
this may be too quick.

07:10.497 --> 07:11.930
Do we really know him?

07:11.998 --> 07:14.433
I wanna know why Simon's
three previous marriages

07:14.501 --> 07:16.567
did not work.

07:16.636 --> 07:19.204
- Let me tell y'all
somethin' confidentially.

07:19.271 --> 07:21.273
I had breakfast with
Simon yesterday.

07:21.340 --> 07:23.809
He says that, at his crib,

07:23.876 --> 07:26.010
he got a p-professional
moving company, man,

07:26.078 --> 07:27.712
ready for them situations.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.281
- My past relationships, I--

07:29.348 --> 07:30.748
I'm pretty good
with packing them up.

07:30.816 --> 07:31.550
[laughing]

07:31.617 --> 07:33.618
I have a professional
moving company

07:33.620 --> 07:35.421
that makes sure
every piece of fabric

07:35.488 --> 07:40.225
makes its way
to where it's supposed to be.

07:40.292 --> 07:42.160
- Now, that's disturbing, right?

07:42.162 --> 07:43.294
Because that's my baby mama,
but guess what.

07:43.362 --> 07:45.163
It ain't even my place
to say nothin' about that,

07:45.231 --> 07:46.764
but that ain't for you
to go back and tell Porsha

07:46.832 --> 07:47.832
and for you to go back
and tell Porsha, Dom.

07:47.900 --> 07:48.599
- Of course, and that's
what I'm trying to say.

07:48.668 --> 07:49.801
- I'm done telling Porsha sh--.

07:54.106 --> 07:55.039
Oh, hello.

07:55.107 --> 07:55.708
- What'd y'all say
about a moving company?

07:55.774 --> 07:56.642
You're moving?
You're moving?

07:56.709 --> 07:58.343
- Anyway, yeah,
I sold my moving company.

07:58.410 --> 07:59.245
- You're moving where?

07:59.311 --> 08:00.979
- No, I had a moving company
that I sold.

08:01.046 --> 08:02.481
- You sold a moving company.
- Yeah.

08:02.549 --> 08:03.882
- Oh, okay.

08:03.949 --> 08:07.987
I'm like, I need you
not to move, okay?

08:08.053 --> 08:09.788
- So, this was me
coming to the table, man,

08:09.790 --> 08:11.190
and tell y'all that I love y'all

08:11.257 --> 08:13.258
and I appreciate all
y'all have done,

08:13.325 --> 08:15.327
but when I see things
that, like,

08:15.394 --> 08:17.495
I-I just cannot help but, like--

08:17.563 --> 08:19.264
- I will talk to Porsha.
I hear you.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.531
Let me deal with
her as her sister.

08:20.533 --> 08:21.933
I promise I will.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.335
And keep coming to stuff.
Keep doing the work.

08:23.402 --> 08:26.137
You're doing a great job, okay?

08:26.205 --> 08:34.205
♪♪

08:34.880 --> 08:37.483
- Lauren?

08:37.550 --> 08:40.418
Lauren!

08:40.486 --> 08:42.554
Lauren!
- I'm meditating.

08:42.622 --> 08:44.857
- Why are you meditating
with a robe on outside?

08:44.924 --> 08:47.359
- It's not hot.
It feels good in the shade.

08:47.426 --> 08:48.727
- No, bitch, you know,
you really tried it.

08:48.794 --> 08:50.895
This-- your-your room is lit.

08:50.963 --> 08:53.632
- It's my trip.
- I mean, it is super lit.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.768
- Yes, it is.
- Why you do me like that?

08:55.834 --> 08:57.702
Is Dennis still in y'all room?

08:57.704 --> 08:58.903
- No, he moved.

08:58.971 --> 09:02.907
He's actually two doors
down from you.

09:02.909 --> 09:04.275
- Is that why
he was on my floor?

09:04.343 --> 09:05.243
- Oh, you saw him?

09:05.311 --> 09:06.411
- I thought he was going to
his mama's room.

09:06.478 --> 09:09.247
- No, girl, he's literally
two doors down from you guys.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.517
I mean, I guess
it's because of the date he has.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.318
I just told him he just needs to
come to everything

09:13.320 --> 09:14.452
that he agreed to come to.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.789
- From?
- Like, dinners, meditations.

09:17.857 --> 09:22.728
- I literally don't see an issue
with this girl

09:22.795 --> 09:24.262
here at the resort.
- Yeah.

09:24.264 --> 09:29.134
- My biggest thing is that
it's a family retreat.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.804
I think it's about time that
he states his intention.

09:31.870 --> 09:34.139
- I think he stated
his intention.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.139
- What is it?

09:35.207 --> 09:36.742
- My intention on this trip,

09:36.809 --> 09:39.677
to build a relationship
with Simon,

09:39.745 --> 09:43.282
so we can start our process
of coparenting.

09:43.349 --> 09:44.383
- Yes.

09:44.450 --> 09:48.353
He wants to help to make sure
the family is healed

09:48.420 --> 09:49.822
and that everyone
can communicate

09:49.888 --> 09:52.490
in an effective manner,
including you and Mama Gina.

09:52.558 --> 09:57.029
- Me and Mama Gina will not
be communicating effectively.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.197
It's really hot.

09:58.263 --> 10:02.300
Listen, I have let go of
the thought of having Mama Gina

10:02.302 --> 10:06.705
be integrated into my family
in a real way.

10:10.209 --> 10:13.111
♪♪

10:13.178 --> 10:17.448
Listen, at this point,
I have let go of the thought of

10:17.516 --> 10:21.786
having Mama Gina be integrated
into my family in a real way.

10:21.788 --> 10:25.323
I told you that I had fasted,
and prayed,

10:25.391 --> 10:26.825
and prepared to come here.

10:26.892 --> 10:28.694
So, the first day I got here,
and it was like, boom,

10:28.760 --> 10:30.428
slapped in the face.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.063
Then yesterday, she was like,

10:32.065 --> 10:34.333
"If there's anyone
I've offended"...

10:34.400 --> 10:38.337
- If there's anyone I may have
made you uncomfortable,

10:38.404 --> 10:41.939
and I ask that you forgive me.

10:42.007 --> 10:44.142
- You know exactly
who you offended.

10:44.210 --> 10:45.943
You offended me.

10:46.011 --> 10:47.846
See, right there,
I can't get with

10:47.913 --> 10:49.947
because it's not being honest.

10:50.015 --> 10:52.217
Mama Gina and I
clearly have issues

10:52.219 --> 10:56.054
that we need to get through
to even reach or begin healing.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.923
The problem is,
she's not here for her own self

10:58.925 --> 11:01.026
and her own relationship
with me,

11:01.093 --> 11:02.861
her own relationship
with my family.

11:02.928 --> 11:04.896
She's only here for
her relationship with her son,

11:04.963 --> 11:07.498
and that's not gonna cause
togetherness with us.

11:07.566 --> 11:09.100
Here's my question to you.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.302
Since my (BLEEP) up
was thinking that

11:11.370 --> 11:14.039
I could have this big ol'
perfect family, right,

11:14.106 --> 11:16.442
now that we have
these people here,

11:16.508 --> 11:20.045
how am I supposed
to deal with this,

11:20.112 --> 11:23.047
with me still being hurt,
me still being toyed with?

11:23.115 --> 11:27.119
The first time she even smiled
was last night at the dinner

11:27.186 --> 11:29.755
when she was like,
"Oh, Dennis has a date here,

11:29.822 --> 11:32.324
"and it's his date's birthday.
Ha-ha-ha."

11:32.391 --> 11:35.259
You've been a mute,
but now that you have somethin'

11:35.261 --> 11:37.729
that you think you can taunt,
it's a joke.

11:39.131 --> 11:40.665
- Honestly, I've seen
your experience with her,

11:40.733 --> 11:43.000
so you're not wrong.
I-I totally get it.

11:43.068 --> 11:46.404
What I'm saying, is that we're
not trying to change Mama Gina.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.474
What we are doing,
we are changing our perspective

11:48.540 --> 11:49.607
around the situation.

11:49.675 --> 11:52.944
I just want you to hear yourself
when you're talking,

11:53.011 --> 11:55.813
and you talk
in the manner of blame,

11:55.881 --> 11:57.081
and point, and point,

11:57.149 --> 12:02.753
when you have some of
the same issues yourself.

12:02.755 --> 12:04.356
I want you to be real.
You're not being real.

12:04.423 --> 12:06.524
I hear you coming with the BS.
- How am I not being real?

12:06.592 --> 12:09.093
- I hear you coming
and not being vulnerable.

12:09.161 --> 12:11.163
I hear you before you
get the fifth word in.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.497
- I don't understand.

12:12.564 --> 12:14.165
- You wanted
this blended family,

12:14.167 --> 12:14.800
and now you're like,
"Oh, (BLEEP) it.

12:14.866 --> 12:17.902
"I give it up.
It's hard."

12:17.904 --> 12:21.040
- I'm not gonna keep
opening up myself to someone

12:21.106 --> 12:23.908
who is constantly doing things
to take shots at me.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.310
- She's not going away.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.578
You figure it out.
- She can go a (BLEEP) away!

12:27.646 --> 12:30.581
I am letting go,
and what I let go at that water,

12:30.583 --> 12:33.117
is the idea that she has
to be my family.

12:33.119 --> 12:36.755
What she is, is Pilar's family.

12:36.823 --> 12:38.723
- I actually feel like
you are the one

12:38.725 --> 12:43.194
that hasn't completely opened up

12:43.262 --> 12:47.332
and been completely transparent.

12:47.399 --> 12:50.067
- I haven't been given a tool

12:50.135 --> 12:52.070
to combat anything that
I've been feeling.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.473
- You didn't come to meditation.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.743
- Uh...
- You weren't there.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.277
- I don't know if meditation
would've given me

12:59.279 --> 13:00.846
anything to combat this.
What I'm saying--

13:00.912 --> 13:03.047
- But that's why we're here,
is to meditate

13:03.049 --> 13:07.151
and to use our spiritual tools
to learn how to open up.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.554
- Teacher, guider--
- Okay.

13:09.621 --> 13:11.956
- Would you assist
in unblocking?

13:12.024 --> 13:13.891
- Then come to my room and say,
"Okay, I gotta get deeper.

13:13.893 --> 13:14.759
"I wasn't feeling it.
Let's get deeper."

13:14.827 --> 13:16.494
- What do you think
I'm sitting here for,

13:16.562 --> 13:17.563
talking to you, right now?

13:17.629 --> 13:19.030
I could be downstairs
with my man

13:19.097 --> 13:23.034
gettin' another drink.
- That's the problem.

13:23.101 --> 13:24.568
[sighs]

13:26.105 --> 13:28.106
Your ability to open up

13:28.108 --> 13:31.843
should not be contingent
upon who is there.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.880
- But it is.

13:34.946 --> 13:38.584
I feel like once I started
hearing that Dennis

13:38.650 --> 13:40.651
was trying to bring somebody,
and I have not--

13:40.653 --> 13:41.786
- But you're making it
about him.

13:41.854 --> 13:43.021
- I haven't-- hold on.
I'm not finished.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.089
I hadn't heard anything from--

13:44.156 --> 13:47.992
- Because you keep making it
about other people.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.727
What are you fixing within you?

13:49.795 --> 13:53.598
- I feel like I am fixed.
- You're not.

13:53.665 --> 13:54.865
I know you're not
doing the work.

13:54.867 --> 13:57.201
- Are you serious, right now?
- Did you go to the session?

13:57.203 --> 13:59.203
- So, because I missed
one meditation--

13:59.205 --> 14:03.875
- You missed one,
and this was your idea.

14:03.877 --> 14:06.144
This blended family
is her dream.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.678
You would think that
she would be at everything,

14:07.746 --> 14:09.080
trying to get herself together,

14:09.147 --> 14:11.616
but it seems like
she feels like, oh,

14:11.683 --> 14:13.150
if I fix everyone in the family,

14:13.218 --> 14:15.119
then I'll have
my blended family.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.688
No. You fix yourself.

14:17.756 --> 14:19.357
You are supposed
to lead this family.

14:19.424 --> 14:21.160
You are the example.
- So, I missed one meditation.

14:21.226 --> 14:23.227
I am a whole (BLEEP) up
for the trip.

14:23.295 --> 14:25.831
- That is the most unpresent,
unmindful thing

14:25.898 --> 14:27.899
I could think of.
- I'm not mindful.

14:27.901 --> 14:28.867
I'm not present.
I'm learning this sh--.

14:28.935 --> 14:31.303
- Then come to meditation
and do it! Do the work!

14:31.370 --> 14:33.038
- Sittin' quiet ain't
gonna change this sh--!

14:33.105 --> 14:34.239
- Yes, it is!
- No, it's not!

14:34.306 --> 14:35.574
- Listen to yourself.
- It's not!

14:35.641 --> 14:38.243
- You're not trying!

14:38.310 --> 14:40.378
- Okay, well, I still
do work on myself.

14:40.446 --> 14:42.347
- Working on yourself
with yourself,

14:42.414 --> 14:45.449
without instruction
or a licensed therapist,

14:45.517 --> 14:49.321
can be very--

14:49.388 --> 14:51.389
- You can hear from God,
I understand,

14:51.456 --> 14:54.458
but you still have an ego,
and you still have a bias.

14:54.526 --> 14:56.927
You're still human.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.596
- I am detaching
from the thought

14:58.598 --> 15:00.931
that I don't want my daughter

15:00.933 --> 15:03.734
to have a threshold
coparenting situation.

15:03.802 --> 15:09.341
I never saw my mom step across
daddy and Lisa's step, never.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.542
I even would stand at the steps
while she was calling us

15:11.610 --> 15:14.545
and wonder if she was gonna
cross over the step,

15:14.613 --> 15:16.180
which would've meant...

15:23.356 --> 15:25.156
[sniffles]

15:25.223 --> 15:28.693
It would have meant
a blending of the two families

15:28.760 --> 15:31.495
that I had grew up with.

15:31.563 --> 15:35.133
As a child of divorce,
I just always wanted

15:35.200 --> 15:39.170
her to just step across
the door threshold,

15:39.237 --> 15:42.307
so I felt like she was
a part of this other life.

15:42.374 --> 15:43.441
- Mm-hmm.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.443
- That I didn't just spend
my week with my mom,

15:45.510 --> 15:47.311
and then, all of a sudden,

15:47.313 --> 15:51.248
I'm just dropped
into my dad's world.

15:51.316 --> 15:52.718
So, I didn't want that
for Pilar.

15:52.784 --> 15:54.553
Even though I'm 40 years old,

15:54.619 --> 15:56.921
and I don't think I've ever
even thought about this

15:56.988 --> 16:00.726
until I had Pilar,
it did affect me.

16:00.792 --> 16:04.529
- Mm-hmm.
- I was trying to have,

16:04.531 --> 16:07.999
from the early on, my daughter
be able to experience

16:08.066 --> 16:10.469
her two worlds colliding.
- Of course.

16:10.535 --> 16:14.071
- But I guess I have just felt
nothing but disappointment

16:14.139 --> 16:15.274
since I've gotten here,

16:15.340 --> 16:18.343
and so I'm having to now
deal with

16:18.410 --> 16:22.546
what Pilar's world
will actually look like.

16:22.614 --> 16:24.415
I thought that people
were gonna come here

16:24.483 --> 16:27.818
and just be automatically
open to everything

16:27.886 --> 16:29.988
and tell me how they feel,

16:30.055 --> 16:32.023
and then we were gonna
leave here great,

16:32.025 --> 16:36.427
but I'm seeing that
that's not the case.

16:36.429 --> 16:40.165
- I hear you with this beautiful
dream of this life for Pilar,

16:40.232 --> 16:42.033
and I don't think
it's out of reach.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.502
- You have to tell me how.

16:44.570 --> 16:47.438
- I will, but I need you
to listen to me,

16:47.506 --> 16:49.708
I need to come to
every single practice,

16:49.775 --> 16:52.043
and I need you to understand

16:52.045 --> 16:54.111
that that's a beautiful dream
that you have,

16:54.179 --> 16:55.846
but they are not
on your timeline.

16:55.914 --> 16:57.048
- So, then--
- But guess what,

16:57.050 --> 16:58.650
the only thing you can do--
Guess what you can control.

16:58.717 --> 17:00.519
- What?
- You.

17:00.585 --> 17:03.455
She should be focused on
how she's showing up

17:03.522 --> 17:05.389
and not so much how
everyone else is showing up

17:05.391 --> 17:07.092
and putting the blame
over there.

17:07.158 --> 17:09.094
Actually confronting
her problems

17:09.160 --> 17:10.594
isn't what she does best.

17:10.662 --> 17:13.464
You live your authentic life.
They'll fall in line.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.865
It's Porsha.
- I'm gonna work on me.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.333
If you don't wanna do it,
then you can go.

17:16.401 --> 17:18.203
- So, let's go have some fun.
- Okay.

17:18.270 --> 17:20.171
- We're gonna go ATVing.
- Yes.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.974
- And I think Simon and Storm
is gonna come with us.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.842
- So, who the hell
is going to tequila?

17:24.910 --> 17:27.545
- Londie, Lauren--
- That's a tequila person.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.081
And that's a tequila--
- Uh, Lauren, Dom,

17:30.148 --> 17:34.218
and Dennis.
- Oh, sh--. What?

17:34.220 --> 17:35.286
- So, when I was putting
the trip together,

17:35.353 --> 17:37.621
I was actually thinking
it would be, like, all work,

17:37.689 --> 17:41.025
but I realized that people
are gonna need some relaxation.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.594
You gotta give 'em a little fun,
so they'll come back next time.

17:48.301 --> 17:51.435
But I-I do want you to live,
um, the most authentic

17:51.437 --> 17:53.203
expression of your life.
- I'm gonna try.

17:53.272 --> 17:54.306
- 'Cause I know who you are.
- I'm gonna be quiet.

17:54.372 --> 17:56.641
Right before I do my makeup,
I'm just gonna stand there

17:56.643 --> 17:57.908
and look in the mirror.

17:57.910 --> 18:04.181
♪♪

18:06.786 --> 18:08.519
- Y'all ready?

18:08.521 --> 18:10.521
- When you ever had to
get us ready to drink?

18:10.523 --> 18:11.956
[laughing]

18:11.958 --> 18:17.095
My thing is, okay,

Porsha didn't take her shot,

treat you so bad?

able to be friends,

just cousins.

Porsha has
ass kissers around her.

28:49.694 --> 28:51.261
Dom is an ass kisser.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.363
Lauren is paid
to be an ass kisser.

28:53.365 --> 28:55.800
Hell, Storm got involved
in an entire argument

28:55.866 --> 28:59.303
that had nothing to
do with her to kiss ass.

28:59.305 --> 29:04.007
But I pride myself on being
a very blunt and honest person,

29:04.009 --> 29:07.878

to have a cookout,

29:32.537 --> 29:33.937

her 21st birthday party

29:35.707 --> 29:39.143

- What?

- At Cru?

29:42.480 --> 29:44.014
No.
- Why did she got fired?

29:44.081 --> 29:46.016
- She talked to people
any kind of way,

29:46.083 --> 29:50.020
talked to the managers wrong,
late to work.

29:50.087 --> 29:52.222

talking to Porsha.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.625
- Right.
- Why?

29:55.693 --> 29:56.693
- She didn't like Dennis
at the point when Porsha went

29:56.761 --> 29:58.895

"Hey, I met this guy,

29:58.963 --> 30:00.430

"Oh, I know him.
I don't (BLEEP) with him."

30:02.300 --> 30:04.434

34:12.082 --> 34:13.683
- Oh, man, I'm out.

34:15.352 --> 34:16.085
I don't know about us putting
our issues in the past,

34:16.087 --> 34:17.988
but I know that he's a hater.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.556
It's an unfortunate situation.

34:19.624 --> 34:21.691
He clearly don't
wanna catch a fade,

34:21.759 --> 34:23.527
but I do owe him one.

34:26.497 --> 34:30.134
I still owe him a fade, 1000%.

34:30.200 --> 34:31.568
No bitch, no snitch, great.

34:31.636 --> 34:32.569
Come on, cheers.

34:32.571 --> 34:33.703
- And then you would
still have your bitch,

34:33.771 --> 34:34.971
and Simon wouldn't have her.

34:34.973 --> 34:37.874
- Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

34:37.942 --> 34:39.709
- But now she's not
what Dennis says.

34:39.777 --> 34:41.378
She's doing what Simon says.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.881
- Simon says bust it open
like a freak.

34:43.948 --> 34:46.015
- I-I do also wanna
say that, um,

34:46.083 --> 34:47.852
you said that you
didn't fire her,

34:47.918 --> 34:50.053
but you did fire me, real quick.

34:50.120 --> 34:52.221
- Ooh, yeah, take
that shot, too.

34:52.290 --> 34:53.858
You know, Londie--
- Oh, you know why?

34:53.924 --> 34:55.592
- So, can we ask why?

34:55.660 --> 34:57.794

35:07.005 --> 35:08.137
a year and a half.

35:08.139 --> 35:09.873
Dennis started acting weird

35:09.940 --> 35:11.407
right before
Porsha's baby shower.

35:11.475 --> 35:13.076
He wasn't calling me as much,

35:13.144 --> 35:15.880
and I was really more
back to assisting Porsha,

35:15.946 --> 35:17.481
which was never supposed
to be the case,

35:17.548 --> 35:19.949
and so I asked him, "Am I
your assistant or Porsha's?

35:20.017 --> 35:21.218
What's going on?

35:21.285 --> 35:23.419
And if I am your assistant,
and you're gonna cut my hours,

35:23.487 --> 35:26.022
I need to make more money."

35:26.090 --> 35:27.557
And he said,
"You can leave."

35:27.559 --> 35:29.559
Another shot, another shot,
another shot.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.694

I'm in a family, and I
don't even know the family.

36:58.482 --> 36:59.816
- How did tequila go?

36:59.883 --> 37:00.783
We heard about the spa,

37:00.851 --> 37:02.852
but tequila seems like
it might have been

37:02.920 --> 37:03.954
a little more interesting.

37:04.021 --> 37:04.988
- Wait, wait, no.

37:05.055 --> 37:06.789
The bigger question is,
are you guys sober?

37:06.857 --> 37:07.724
- I'm not.

37:07.791 --> 37:10.126
- Their whole thing
was to drink all day.

37:10.194 --> 37:12.296
- We played a game
at the tequila tasting,

37:12.362 --> 37:13.796
and if you didn't
wanna tell the truth,

37:13.864 --> 37:14.932
then you took a shot.

37:14.999 --> 37:16.132
- Y'all are playing
truth or dare?

37:16.200 --> 37:17.201
- Pretty much, but with liquor.

37:17.268 --> 37:18.135
- Oh, okay.

37:18.202 --> 37:20.203
- That sounds dangerous
and a little fun.

37:20.205 --> 37:22.605
- And-and things came out
that people didn't know,

37:22.673 --> 37:24.741
and it just was that,
what it was.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.677
- Oh, hell, what?

37:28.246 --> 37:29.412
- Told on me for what?

37:29.414 --> 37:31.815
- It was never my intentions
to put nothin' on blast.

37:31.817 --> 37:33.016
I don't move like that.

37:33.083 --> 37:34.884
Now, what I did do was--
- Then what-- Oh!

37:34.952 --> 37:36.753
- I talked to Lauren Williams.

37:36.820 --> 37:39.889
- Oh!

37:39.957 --> 37:42.091
- What did I do?

37:42.093 --> 37:43.760
- Well, I told him
that I told on him.

37:43.828 --> 37:45.462
That's what it is.

37:51.235 --> 37:52.635
- Well, I told him
that I told on him.

37:52.703 --> 37:53.836
That's what it is.

37:53.904 --> 37:54.904
- What?

37:54.906 --> 37:56.574
- You know Dom be telling
half-truths, man.

37:56.640 --> 37:57.640
Don't worry about that guy, man.

37:57.708 --> 37:59.909
- So, then why don't you
tell the whole truth?

37:59.977 --> 38:01.044
- How did y'all
even get to that?

38:01.046 --> 38:03.179
What was the question
that prompted that, Londie?

38:03.247 --> 38:04.847
- Londie?

38:04.915 --> 38:06.115
- Wasn't you there?
- What was the que--

38:06.117 --> 38:10.520
Um, but this wasn't my issue.
- What prompted that answer?

38:10.587 --> 38:12.722
- I don't wanna
be involved in it.

38:12.790 --> 38:15.391
- God, y'all are getting on
my last nerves being so vague.

38:15.459 --> 38:19.128
- Dennis said Dom is
a bit of a snitch.

38:19.196 --> 38:21.464
- It's probably somethin' petty.

38:21.532 --> 38:24.468
- So, Dom and Dennis wanted
to kind of clear the air.

38:24.535 --> 38:26.303
They asked other, "Dennis,
why do you really have

38:26.371 --> 38:27.337
a problem with me?"
- Okay.

38:27.404 --> 38:29.273
- "Dom, why do you have
a problem with me?"

38:29.340 --> 38:31.275
Dom went to the club one night,

38:31.342 --> 38:32.875
one of Dennis' clubs.

38:32.943 --> 38:35.411
He ran into a female
who still worked at a club

38:35.479 --> 38:37.814
that should not be
working at his club.

38:37.882 --> 38:40.717
- But how did he tell on me?
What did I do?

38:42.152 --> 38:43.720
- The same bartender that Dennis

38:43.787 --> 38:46.155
cheated on me with at his club,

38:46.157 --> 38:47.991
what he did, was rehire her.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.158
- Pfft.

38:49.226 --> 38:50.626
- I remember that
because when Dom told me

38:50.694 --> 38:52.563
that she was at the club,
he called me immediately.

38:52.629 --> 38:53.364
- Yo.

38:53.430 --> 38:54.365
- And I was like,
"Do not tell her.

38:54.431 --> 38:56.767
This could break them up.
They have a family."

38:56.834 --> 38:58.502
Y'all were good.

38:58.569 --> 39:00.504
- So, why did they
get into it about that?

39:00.571 --> 39:01.704
- No, nobody got into it.

39:01.772 --> 39:02.305
- Because he said that
I should have never told you.

39:02.307 --> 39:03.040
- Yeah, you snitching.

39:03.107 --> 39:05.575
Why you worrying
about my penis, bro?

39:05.577 --> 39:06.910
Man, he should worry
about his own penis

39:06.977 --> 39:07.977
and who he's sticking it in.

39:08.045 --> 39:09.379
- How did penis get in it?

39:09.446 --> 39:11.981
- 'Cause he all in my business.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.983
- Whatever it is, get over it.

39:14.051 --> 39:14.918
- Huh?

39:14.985 --> 39:16.619
- What's the point of
bringing up old stuff

39:16.621 --> 39:17.587
when we're in--
When we're in-in--

39:17.655 --> 39:19.355
Going to our new stuff?
- Hey, ma, ma, ma, ma.

39:19.423 --> 39:21.457
- Oh, wait, how--
- This is crazy.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.960
It's very petty.
Petty and immature.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.528
- Simon don't need no advice.
He don't need no advice.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.263
- Simon wouldn't sleep
with his young bartender

39:27.331 --> 39:28.598
while his fiance is pregnant.

39:28.600 --> 39:29.532
- You don't need no advice.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.201
You don't got to.
- Simon wouldn't do that.

39:31.268 --> 39:35.138
- I don't believe Porsha
is invested in any way

39:35.140 --> 39:37.607
with Dennis' life anymore,

39:37.675 --> 39:40.810
but does she have
resentment towards him?

39:40.878 --> 39:42.678
Yes, I believe she still does,

39:42.746 --> 39:45.215
and she needs to figure out
a way to resolve that,

39:45.282 --> 39:46.383
so she can heal.

39:47.818 --> 39:49.152
- That's one reason why I don't
even wanna be in this family.

39:50.220 --> 39:51.154
- You know what I'm saying?

39:51.156 --> 39:53.423
- Let me just pick up
my granddaughter,

39:53.425 --> 39:54.692
and you know what I'm--
You know what I'm saying?

39:54.758 --> 39:56.593
- You gotta chill.
- I am fine.

39:56.660 --> 39:57.760
- Okay, ain't your stuff.

39:57.828 --> 39:58.761
This ain't-- this
is not your fight.

39:58.763 --> 39:59.963
- Go ahead.
- She's fine.

39:59.965 --> 40:00.963
- Y'all are so petty.

40:01.031 --> 40:03.967
- This weekend is about
dealing with the past.

40:03.969 --> 40:07.236
That's why we're talking
about it again, Mama Gina.

40:07.304 --> 40:08.706
- Ma, you're doing
too much, man.

40:08.772 --> 40:11.908
Yo, yo, yo, yo,
you're doing too much.

40:11.976 --> 40:13.576
- Now, mama riled up

40:13.578 --> 40:15.845
with somethin' else
that ain't her damn business.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.547
- How long are you gonna
replay that story?

40:18.616 --> 40:20.484
Why should Porsha be
worried about that?

40:20.550 --> 40:21.651
She has a new man.

40:21.719 --> 40:23.619
She shouldn't be
concerned about that.

40:23.687 --> 40:25.721
- It's okay, she's fine.

40:25.789 --> 40:29.492
Dom is always gonna bring up
the most controversial stuff.

40:30.495 --> 40:32.695
- Why he worried about
what I got going on?

40:32.697 --> 40:34.198
- If you was loyal to your girl,

40:34.264 --> 40:35.865
there wouldn't be
a problem here.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.467
- Dom, stop.

40:37.534 --> 40:39.602
- She was riding on the ATV.
- Stop.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.538
- Can we not?
- Why are you allowing him

40:41.605 --> 40:43.473
to say what he wants to say
but shushing Dom?

40:43.540 --> 40:44.608
- I can't even hear him.
I'm not allowing anything.

40:44.675 --> 40:45.942
- When Dom is being loyal.

40:46.010 --> 40:48.744
Don't shush-don't shush Dom.
Shush him.

40:48.812 --> 40:51.014
Shush him.

40:51.081 --> 40:53.684
- Dom, calm down, bro,
before you catch your fade, bro.

40:53.750 --> 40:56.752
- Bro, I ain't catching sh--!

40:56.820 --> 40:59.622
So, if you wanna do
somethin' about it, do it.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.224
- Man, shut up, bro.

41:01.291 --> 41:02.692
- Why don't y'all
just chill out?

41:02.759 --> 41:06.463
- I was--

41:06.531 --> 41:08.097
- Man, be quiet before
you start crying.

41:08.165 --> 41:09.299
Man, be quiet.

41:09.366 --> 41:11.701
- There's nothing
wrong with crying.

41:11.769 --> 41:14.036
- Dom is obviously showing out
in front of Porsha.

41:14.104 --> 41:15.838
Like, we coulda
caught-caught a fade earlier.

41:15.906 --> 41:16.906
We coulda got--
Threw down earlier.

41:16.974 --> 41:18.475
He didn't wanna do
nothin' earlier.

41:18.543 --> 41:19.775
Now, all of a sudden,
he's at the table,

41:19.843 --> 41:21.377
and he's Mr. Tough Guy.

41:21.445 --> 41:24.013
- Just relax, you were
trying to clear the air.

41:24.081 --> 41:27.116
It's-- but both people have
to wanna clear the air.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.051
So, don't worry about it.

41:28.053 --> 41:29.385
- Well, hopefully,
they cleared the air.

41:29.453 --> 41:30.254
Can we move to somethin' else?

41:30.320 --> 41:31.054
- Well, they're still talking.

41:33.123 --> 41:35.992
- Yo!

41:36.060 --> 41:36.859
- Dennis!

41:36.861 --> 41:39.262
- Don't talk to
my mama like that!

41:39.264 --> 41:40.664
- It got to me the first night

41:40.731 --> 41:42.865
when Dennis told Storm
to shut the (BLEEP) up.

41:42.933 --> 41:45.335
Here we are,
for the second time,

41:45.402 --> 41:47.337
you're telling Storm
to shut the (BLEEP) up.

41:47.404 --> 41:49.539
See, now, it's escalating.

41:49.541 --> 41:51.274
Each dinner is getting
worse, and worse, and worse.

41:51.276 --> 41:53.443
So, now let's end
the conversation,

41:53.445 --> 41:54.643
and then you need to go.

41:54.712 --> 41:56.145
Security!
- Dennis.

41:56.147 --> 41:57.881
- Get him out.
I'm not sitting at this table

41:57.948 --> 41:59.682
for him to tell my cousin
to shut the (BLEEP) up.

41:59.684 --> 42:00.750
- Dennis, it's okay.

42:00.817 --> 42:02.953
- All right, we're gonna start
having separate dinners.

42:03.020 --> 42:05.588
- It's because they
can't get past whatever.

42:05.656 --> 42:07.690
- But neither can Dennis.
He in it with him.

42:07.692 --> 42:08.725
He's in it with him.
- Oh, I wouldn't get past it

42:08.792 --> 42:11.627
either if-if it's continually
being brought up.

42:11.695 --> 42:12.495
- You're not gonna keep
telling my cousin

42:12.562 --> 42:13.963
to shut the (BLEEP) up.
- Yeah, she--

42:13.965 --> 42:15.365
She's talking around
people like--

42:15.432 --> 42:16.300
She ain't got no sense.

42:16.366 --> 42:17.701
- He needs to get
the (BLEEP) outta here,

42:17.768 --> 42:19.969
him, and his sluts,
and his mother.

42:19.971 --> 42:21.304
- Uh-uh, uh-uh, Dennis.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

42:21.306 --> 42:22.905
- Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
No, no, no.

42:22.973 --> 42:24.407
- I'm leaving.
Let's go. Let's go.

42:24.475 --> 42:25.441
Let's go, let's go.

42:25.509 --> 42:27.343
- Dennis! Dennis!
- All right, let's go, let's go.

42:27.345 --> 42:28.612
- Oh, my God.

42:28.678 --> 42:30.047
- Tell her not to
talk to people, bro.

42:30.113 --> 42:31.381
She's a kid.
She a kid.

42:31.448 --> 42:32.616
- She is not a kid.
She's grown, too.

42:32.682 --> 42:34.150
- Come on. She's a kid!
- Let's go!

42:34.218 --> 42:35.251
Go! Go!
- She's grown.

42:35.319 --> 42:36.319
- You're part of the problem
'cause you [indistinct].

42:36.386 --> 42:37.186
- I'm a part of the problem?
Wait a minute, now.

42:37.254 --> 42:39.055
- Don't ----in'--
Don't clap at me, bro.

42:39.057 --> 42:39.923
- Go! Go!
- Hold on.

42:39.990 --> 42:42.525
- Don't talk-- don't
worry about nothin'--

42:42.527 --> 42:43.526
- Go!
- Yo, yo, just chill, chill.

42:43.594 --> 42:44.593
Yo, chill!

42:44.595 --> 42:46.463
Yo, chill.
- Get out! Go!

42:46.530 --> 42:47.797
- (BLEEP) you.
I ain't gotta be here!

42:47.865 --> 42:49.131
You asked me to come here.

42:49.199 --> 42:50.734
- Great, go.

42:50.801 --> 42:53.069
- Storm, shut your ass up.
- Go.

42:53.071 --> 42:55.071
Go, you and your mama.
- Let's go.

42:55.138 --> 42:56.405
- Get the (BLEEP) out!
- Come on, let's go.

42:56.473 --> 42:57.607
- Girl, shut up.

42:57.609 --> 42:59.909
- You shut up,
no good-ass (BLEEP).

43:02.480 --> 43:03.946
- You heard what I said.

43:03.948 --> 43:05.015
I said--
- I don't give a (BLEEP).

43:05.082 --> 43:08.117
[indistinct yelling]

43:13.691 --> 43:17.160
- Oh, my God, my son!
