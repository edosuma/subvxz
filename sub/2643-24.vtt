WEBVTT

00:01.931 --> 00:03.198
Hey, you guys ready to order?

00:03.234 --> 00:05.002
Uh, sure.
Okay, Priya?

00:05.100 --> 00:06.100
Uh, I'll have
the shepherd's pie.

00:06.101 --> 00:07.335
You want to split
that with me?

00:07.336 --> 00:09.136
Oh, no, no, no,
he doesn't.

00:09.137 --> 00:10.171
Why not?

00:10.172 --> 00:12.340
Well, you have milk in
the taters,

00:12.341 --> 00:14.175
milk in the gravy,
parmesan crust.

00:14.176 --> 00:15.910
Your lactose-intolerant
boyfriend will turn

00:15.911 --> 00:18.313
into a gas-filled
Macy's Day balloon.

00:18.314 --> 00:20.315
(all laugh)

00:20.316 --> 00:23.450
Not quite accurate. The Macy's
balloons are filled with helium,

00:23.451 --> 00:26.353
whereas Leonard produces copious
amounts of methane.

00:26.354 --> 00:28.222
(all laugh)

00:28.223 --> 00:30.224
(goofy snicker)

00:31.927 --> 00:34.361
So, no, on the shepherd's pie.
Can we move on?

00:34.362 --> 00:36.363
Yeah, a little tip:
he says he can eat frozen yogurt.

00:36.364 --> 00:38.732
Do not believe it.

00:38.733 --> 00:41.535
Sea bass!
I'll have the sea bass!

00:41.536 --> 00:42.970
You gotta like this,

00:42.971 --> 00:45.139
the girlfriend and the
ex-girlfriend bonding

00:45.140 --> 00:47.308
over your rooty-tooty
stinky booty.

00:47.309 --> 00:48.642
(all laugh)

00:48.643 --> 00:50.177
Kill me.

00:50.178 --> 00:52.813
It wouldn't help.
The human body is capable

00:52.814 --> 00:55.982
of being flatulent for hours
after death.

00:55.983 --> 00:57.984
(snickers)

01:00.687 --> 01:03.089
Guys, sorry I'm late.
I have amazing news.

01:03.090 --> 01:05.090
Bernadette, before you
change the subject,

01:05.092 --> 01:07.093
does anyone have any
final comments on

01:07.094 --> 01:09.028
Leonard's faulty
digestive system?

01:09.029 --> 01:11.130
So, what's your news,
Bernadette?

01:11.131 --> 01:15.301
The thesis committee accepted
my doctoral dissertation.

01:15.302 --> 01:17.070
I'm getting my PhD!

01:17.071 --> 01:18.738
Wow!
Oh, congratulations.

01:20.307 --> 01:23.542
Wow, so that means you're a
doctor, you're a doctor,

01:23.543 --> 01:26.045
you're a doctor,
you're a doctor,

01:26.046 --> 01:29.515
and Howard,
you know a lot of doctors.

01:29.516 --> 01:31.083
(chuckling)

01:32.386 --> 01:34.186
Congratulations, honey.

01:34.187 --> 01:35.788
Thank you.

01:35.789 --> 01:37.890
So, Howard, tell us,
how's it feel knowing

01:37.891 --> 01:39.492
that when you two get married,

01:39.493 --> 01:41.727
you'll be referred to
as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?

01:42.962 --> 01:44.864
Unless he takes Bernadette's
last name.

01:44.865 --> 01:46.465
And considering
her advanced status,

01:46.466 --> 01:48.801
that could open
some doors for him.

01:48.802 --> 01:51.724
Please, this isn't about me.
I'm proud of you.

01:51.725 --> 01:53.817
Well, you'll be
really be proud of this.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.690
I was headhunted by a big
pharmaceutical company.

01:56.826 --> 01:58.757
They're gonna pay me
a buttload of money!

01:59.281 --> 02:00.382
What?

02:00.480 --> 02:02.381
Bernadette, that's great.

02:02.382 --> 02:04.182
Howard, do you make a buttload?

02:04.183 --> 02:07.352
Better than what you've
got a buttload of.

02:10.689 --> 02:13.658
Hey, if I roll down the windows
in the car, everything's peachy.

02:13.659 --> 02:15.827
If you do it,
you're still not a doctor.

02:17.063 --> 02:19.031
Yeah, just a heads-up
on the car window deal.

02:19.032 --> 02:21.166
It helps, but everything is
not "peachy."

ridiculous in this dress.

03:04.371 --> 03:08.307
LEONARD: You look beautiful,
Lieutenant Uhura.

03:08.308 --> 03:11.277
(a la Capt. Kirk):
Now prepare for... inspection.

03:13.380 --> 03:15.514
PRIYA: Shh, my brother's
going to hear you.

03:15.515 --> 03:16.882
LEONARD: Relax, he's got
headphones on.

03:16.883 --> 03:20.519
And we're ten miles above
Earth in a starship.

03:20.520 --> 03:21.620
Really, ten miles?

03:21.621 --> 03:23.922
You're orbiting inside
the atmosphere?

03:23.923 --> 03:25.757
Moron.

03:25.758 --> 03:27.985
PRIYA: I can't believe
I'm wearing

03:28.010 --> 03:30.475
my brother's Halloween costume.

03:30.563 --> 03:33.731
LEONARD : I can't believe you think
he only wears it on Halloween.

03:35.100 --> 03:38.469
Open the landing bay doors,
shuttle craft approaching.

03:38.470 --> 03:40.137
Okay, gotta go.

03:46.412 --> 03:47.878
Hey, what's up?

03:47.879 --> 03:52.550
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Is that my future
daughter-in-law, the doctor?!

03:54.453 --> 03:56.654
No, Ma! It's Raj!

03:56.655 --> 03:58.956
He's a doctor
too, right?!

03:58.957 --> 04:00.725
Yes!

04:00.726 --> 04:03.094
Like Leonard and
the skinny weirdo!

04:05.062 --> 04:07.130
Sheldon, yes!

04:07.131 --> 04:09.299
Everybody's a doctor but me!

04:09.300 --> 04:12.869
Well, whose fault
is that?!

04:13.971 --> 04:15.205
What's up?

04:15.206 --> 04:17.906
Leonard's putting disgusting
memories in

04:17.908 --> 04:20.476
my memory foam mattress.

04:20.478 --> 04:21.845
Can I stay here tonight?

04:21.846 --> 04:24.448
Sure, but I'm going out
with Bernadette.

04:24.449 --> 04:26.082
It'll just be you and my mother.

04:26.083 --> 04:27.651
I guess that's okay.

04:27.652 --> 04:31.288
Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!

04:31.289 --> 04:34.057
Of course, he and I
can play doctor!

04:37.761 --> 04:39.928
She's kidding, right?

04:39.929 --> 04:42.498
I don't know, she's pretty
feisty since

04:42.499 --> 04:44.667
they put her on
hormone-replacement therapy.

04:45.969 --> 04:49.572
Paging Dr.
Cutie Pie!

04:51.875 --> 04:53.876
I must say, Amy,
I was very impressed

04:53.877 --> 04:56.879
to see that Bernadette got
her PhD.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.581
It's indeed admirable.

04:58.582 --> 05:01.417
Although, it is...
microbiology.

05:01.418 --> 05:04.887
Your doctorate is in
neurobiology.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.221
I fail to see the distinction.

05:07.222 --> 05:08.490
I'll make it simple for you.

05:08.491 --> 05:10.425
I study the brain,

05:10.426 --> 05:12.560
the organ responsible for
Beethoven's <i>Fifth Symphony.</i>

05:12.561 --> 05:14.095
Bernadette studies yeast,

05:14.096 --> 05:16.598
the organism responsible
for Michelob Lite.

05:18.233 --> 05:20.134
Is there something wrong
with your neck?

05:20.135 --> 05:22.203
It's a little stiff.

05:22.204 --> 05:24.406
What a remarkably fragile
structure

05:24.407 --> 05:27.709
to support
such a valuable payload.

05:27.710 --> 05:32.781
Not unlike balancing a Faberge
egg on a Pixie Stick.

05:32.782 --> 05:34.616
Have you considered massage?

05:34.617 --> 05:37.217
I'd like to respond
to that sarcastically:

05:37.218 --> 05:40.821
Yes, I relish the thought
of a stranger covering my body

05:40.822 --> 05:42.856
with oil and rubbing it.

05:42.857 --> 05:46.727
I was proposing you massage your
muscles with your own hands.

05:46.728 --> 05:50.163
Still sounds like a lot
of unnecessary touching.

05:50.164 --> 05:53.534
Trust me. With your right hand,
locate the spot

05:53.535 --> 05:55.803
where the scapula meets
the acromion process.

05:58.139 --> 05:59.906
All right.

05:59.907 --> 06:02.242
Now push your third finger along
the ridge of the shoulder blade,

06:02.243 --> 06:03.744
making a small rotation
as you do so.

06:03.745 --> 06:07.314
Rotating.

06:07.315 --> 06:09.081
You should feel
a small node-like object

06:09.082 --> 06:10.916
rolling back and forth along
the bone.

06:10.917 --> 06:13.018
You mean the myofascial point?

06:13.019 --> 06:16.055
Obviously.

06:16.056 --> 06:18.758
Now bear down on it like
the seventh grade noogies

06:18.759 --> 06:20.760
we all know too well.

06:22.429 --> 06:26.399
Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes,
oh, yes!

06:28.134 --> 06:30.236
Amy, I've never been touched
like this before!

06:32.506 --> 06:36.242
Oh! My hands are magic!

06:36.243 --> 06:37.810
Don't flatter yourself.

06:37.811 --> 06:40.178
Your hands are blunt tools
guided by my knowledge

06:40.179 --> 06:41.413
of the nervous system.

06:41.414 --> 06:45.584
I could just as easily have
paralyzed you.

06:45.585 --> 06:46.752
(knocking)

06:46.753 --> 06:49.020
There's someone at my door.

06:49.021 --> 06:50.756
That doesn't interest me.
Good-bye.

06:56.061 --> 06:58.829
- Can I sleep here tonight?
- Why?

06:58.932 --> 07:00.492
Leonard's having
astronomically inaccurate

07:00.621 --> 07:03.623
<i>Star Trek</i> sex with my sister.

07:03.703 --> 07:06.104
I can see how that would be
upsetting. Come in.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.340
I'll get the sheets
and blankets for the couch.

07:09.341 --> 07:11.709
Oh, don't bother.
I'll just sleep in Leonard's room.

07:11.710 --> 07:13.277
No, I can't authorize that.

07:13.278 --> 07:16.113
Well, he's in my bed.
Why can't I be in his?

07:16.114 --> 07:18.649
The Hammurabic Code is
"an eye for an eye,"

07:18.650 --> 07:20.718
not "a bed for a bed."

07:20.719 --> 07:23.454
Come on, dude, I'm exhausted,
and Tyra Banks says

07:23.455 --> 07:25.656
the most important item in your
makeup bag is

07:25.657 --> 07:27.090
a good night's sleep.

07:30.862 --> 07:32.396
All right.

07:32.397 --> 07:35.900
This is a form
indemnifying me

07:35.901 --> 07:40.404
from your use of
"Leonard's bedroom."

07:40.405 --> 07:42.371
Sign here, indicating
that I tried to stop you

07:42.372 --> 07:46.843
and did so using
a stern facial expression.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.614
Good night, Sheldon.

07:51.615 --> 07:53.015
Wait. Not yet.

07:53.016 --> 07:54.484
We still have to go over
safety procedures.

07:54.485 --> 07:57.520
Now, the apartment has three
emergency exits located

07:57.521 --> 07:59.221
here, here, and here.

07:59.222 --> 08:01.658
In the event of a power outage,

08:01.659 --> 08:05.094
luminous paint will guide you
to the nearest exit.

08:05.773 --> 08:06.806
You're kidding.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:16.838 --> 08:19.672
I never kid about safety.

08:27.784 --> 08:30.119
(both gasp)

08:30.120 --> 08:33.054
What are you doing here?

08:33.056 --> 08:34.423
I was sleeping.

08:34.424 --> 08:35.624
In my bed?

08:35.625 --> 08:37.326
Well, I would've slept
in my own bed,

08:37.327 --> 08:39.395
but it was being used
to bring shame to my family.

08:40.530 --> 08:44.099
And the memory
of Gene Roddenberry.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.700
Oh, you heard?

08:45.701 --> 08:49.604
"Scotty, I need more power."

08:49.605 --> 08:52.907
Sorry. Does Sheldon know
you're sleeping in here?

08:52.908 --> 08:55.143
Are you kidding?
He made me sign a waiver,

08:55.144 --> 08:57.312
participate in
an emergency fire drill

08:57.313 --> 09:00.748
and take a refresher course
in CPR.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.783
Thank God he had a dummy.

09:02.784 --> 09:05.820
Oh, yeah.
Mouth-to-Mouth Mona.

09:05.821 --> 09:08.456
You know,
she used to date Howard?

09:08.457 --> 09:11.792
Oh, my God, she's <i>that</i> Mona?

09:11.793 --> 09:15.329
Why can't you and my sister
spend your nights here?

09:15.330 --> 09:17.431
We tried. She doesn't get along
with Sheldon.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.866
Sheldon doesn't get along
with Sheldon.

09:19.867 --> 09:22.602
It's still no reason
for me to have to listen to you

09:22.603 --> 09:25.406
arm your
photon torpedoes every night.

09:25.407 --> 09:28.708
Okay, well, how about this:
until Priya gets her own place,

09:28.709 --> 09:30.977
you stay here and I'll stay at
your apartment.

09:30.978 --> 09:34.915
Can I bring girls here?

09:34.916 --> 09:37.418
You?

09:37.419 --> 09:39.486
Sure. Bring as many as you want.

09:39.487 --> 09:42.256
Okay, deal.

09:44.526 --> 09:46.259
Just not against their will.

09:52.428 --> 09:54.596
You really think you should be
eating that cake?

09:54.597 --> 09:55.564
Why?

09:55.565 --> 09:56.866
If you're gonna be

09:56.867 --> 09:58.567
a trophy husband
for a rich wife,

09:58.568 --> 10:01.103
you might want
to watch your waistline.

10:01.104 --> 10:02.304
He's right.

10:02.305 --> 10:05.307
A minute on the lips,
a lifetime on the hips.

10:05.308 --> 10:07.176
Yeah, ha-ha.

10:07.177 --> 10:10.746
First of all, I'm not threatened
by my fiancée's success.

10:10.747 --> 10:11.847
I'm proud of her.

10:11.848 --> 10:13.515
And secondly,
I have my own career.

10:13.516 --> 10:17.652
Until you have kids.

10:17.653 --> 10:19.453
Good news, Raj.

10:19.454 --> 10:21.355
I got the blood work
back from the lab.

10:21.356 --> 10:23.992
You're okay to stay for a while.

10:23.993 --> 10:25.560
When did you take my blood?

10:25.561 --> 10:27.796
Not important.

10:27.797 --> 10:30.631
Your sugar was a little high.

10:30.632 --> 10:33.201
I'd follow up
with your regular physician.

10:33.202 --> 10:34.969
In the meantime, I have some
paperwork here

10:34.970 --> 10:36.204
for you to go over.

10:36.205 --> 10:37.238
What the hell is this?

10:37.239 --> 10:39.007
Boilerplate stuff.

10:39.008 --> 10:42.276
A modified roommate agreement
for a temporary house guest.

10:42.277 --> 10:46.046
And a living will and durable
power of attorney.

10:46.047 --> 10:49.684
This says you can make
nd o of li" decisions for me.

10:49.685 --> 10:53.554
As your friend, let's hope it
doesn't come to that.

10:53.555 --> 10:54.755
Please sign.

10:54.756 --> 10:56.591
Did you sign this?

10:56.592 --> 10:58.125
There's a reciprocity
clause.

10:58.126 --> 10:59.993
You get to pull
the plug on him, too.

11:01.296 --> 11:04.332
Well, that seems fair.

11:04.333 --> 11:07.868
Congratulations and welcome
temporarily aboard.

11:07.869 --> 11:09.403
Here's your I.D. card,

11:09.404 --> 11:14.342
your key and your lapel pin.

11:14.343 --> 11:16.877
Which Leonard was
too cool to wear.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.749
FYI, part of your
responsibilities

11:22.750 --> 11:25.352
as roommate pro tem
will be to drive me

11:25.353 --> 11:28.154
to and from work, the comic book
store, the barbershop

11:28.155 --> 11:32.626
and the park for one hour every
other Sunday for fresh air.

11:32.627 --> 11:35.262
Bring a ball or a Frisbee,

11:35.263 --> 11:37.564
you know, something
he can chase.

11:37.565 --> 11:40.800
Also, you're tasked
with bringing home

11:40.801 --> 11:41.968
all takeout dinners.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.336
Tonight is Thai food.

11:43.337 --> 11:45.972
You'll find the standard order
in appendix B

11:45.973 --> 11:48.408
or downloadable
from my FTP server.

11:48.409 --> 11:49.776
If you have
any questions,

11:49.777 --> 11:51.277
here's the FAQ sheet,

11:51.278 --> 11:53.845
or if you prefer
the human touch,

11:53.846 --> 11:55.681
I do a live web chat called
"Apartment Talk"

11:55.682 --> 11:57.949
on Tuesday nights.

11:59.619 --> 12:02.621
No backsies.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.992
(romantic jazz playing)

12:06.993 --> 12:09.361
Sheldon, dinner!

12:16.603 --> 12:17.969
What is this?

12:17.970 --> 12:20.773
This is the difference
between

12:20.774 --> 12:22.808
eating and dining.

12:25.711 --> 12:30.115
Remarkable.
I'm just realizing how much

12:30.116 --> 12:33.285
Leonard's been skating by
all these years.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.687
It's not a big thing.

12:35.688 --> 12:39.024
Just think of me as
a brown Martha Stewart.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.325
(knock on door)

12:41.360 --> 12:42.493
Hey, Sheldon,

12:42.494 --> 12:43.962
did you change
your Wi-Fi password again?

12:43.963 --> 12:47.565
Yes, it's "Penny, get your
own Wi-Fi." No spaces.

12:47.566 --> 12:49.301
Thanks.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.536
Wow! What's with
the fancy spread?

12:51.537 --> 12:54.239
My new roommate
is bending over backwards

12:54.240 --> 12:55.841
to ingratiate himself to me.

12:55.842 --> 13:00.177
Uh, nice touch,
by the way.

13:00.178 --> 13:02.346
What do you mean "new roommate"?
What happened to Leonard?

13:02.347 --> 13:04.681
The same thing that happened
to Homo erectus.

13:04.682 --> 13:07.351
He was replaced
by a superior species.

13:08.386 --> 13:10.520
I'm the new Homo in town.

13:13.992 --> 13:15.692
That came out wrong.

13:15.693 --> 13:18.162
All right, let me try this
again. Where's Leonard?

13:18.163 --> 13:20.497
He's living at my place,
so I'm living here.

13:20.498 --> 13:22.532
You're living here
provisionally.

13:22.533 --> 13:25.002
But I must say
it's looking good.

13:25.003 --> 13:28.072
Oh Leonard and Priya
are living together?

13:28.073 --> 13:29.073
That's big.

13:29.074 --> 13:34.043
No. Origami napkin swans...

13:34.044 --> 13:36.880
that's the headline.

13:36.881 --> 13:39.816
It's a good thing.

13:41.185 --> 13:44.120
So do you know what kind
of research you'll be doing

13:44.121 --> 13:45.722
at this pharmaceutical
company?

13:45.723 --> 13:48.458
Well, there are a couple of
opportunities available,

13:48.459 --> 13:52.496
but I volunteered for the
premature ejaculation project.

13:56.300 --> 14:00.403
I mean, it's not like either
one of us has heart disease.

14:04.107 --> 14:06.842
Oh, I almost forgot.
I got you a little present.

14:06.843 --> 14:09.612
Oh, Bernie, no.
You didn't have to.

14:09.613 --> 14:11.914
I wanted to.
Come on, open it.

14:14.451 --> 14:18.387
You bought me a Rolex?

14:18.388 --> 14:20.589
How much did this cost?

14:20.590 --> 14:22.691
Oh, you let me worry
about the money.

14:24.994 --> 14:27.830
I just want my baby
to have pretty things.

14:32.768 --> 14:34.302
More wine?

14:34.303 --> 14:36.638
Oh, no, no, no. I've had
way too much already.

14:36.639 --> 14:38.907
Here's an interesting
fact about alcohol...

14:38.908 --> 14:40.575
Hit me.
(clears throat)

14:43.378 --> 14:46.748
Man is not the only species

14:46.749 --> 14:49.617
that ferments fruit
in order to become intoxicated.

14:49.618 --> 14:51.285
Can you guess what the other is?

14:51.286 --> 14:54.221
Hint: sometimes they pack
the alcohol

14:54.222 --> 14:56.357
in their trunks.

14:56.358 --> 14:58.460
Monkeys.

15:01.497 --> 15:04.765
When does a monkey
have a trunk?

15:04.766 --> 15:08.001
When a suitcase just won't do.

15:10.538 --> 15:12.873
Mmm, all right.

15:12.874 --> 15:14.942
It would appear as if alcohol

15:14.943 --> 15:16.977
is playing keep-away
with your intelligence.

15:16.978 --> 15:18.879
Good night.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.147
Please note,
it is now past 10:00 p.m.

15:21.148 --> 15:23.784
Per our roommate agreement,
kindly refrain

15:23.785 --> 15:25.185
from raucous laughter,

15:25.186 --> 15:27.855
clinking of glasses,
and celebratory gunfire.

15:30.792 --> 15:31.925
Okay...
(clears throat)

15:31.926 --> 15:33.826
explain something to me.

15:33.827 --> 15:37.297
You watch Leonard put up with
that guy for years and years.

15:37.298 --> 15:40.367
What has to break inside
your brain for you to think,

15:40.368 --> 15:43.169
(with Indian accent):
"Oh, Krishna, I've got to
get me some of that"?

15:44.705 --> 15:46.873
Well, it's a lot better than

15:46.874 --> 15:49.175
having to wear noise-cancelling
headphones in my own apartment.

15:49.176 --> 15:51.511
What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah.

15:51.512 --> 15:54.080
Leonard's a noisy little dude
in the sack.

15:54.081 --> 15:56.416
Every night.
Really?

15:56.417 --> 15:58.418
Even during allergy season,
when he has to alternate

15:58.419 --> 16:00.387
between kissing and breathing?

16:02.089 --> 16:04.590
It's my sister. Can we not
talk about this anymore?

16:04.591 --> 16:07.726
Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

16:07.727 --> 16:09.728
Can I tell you a secret?

16:09.729 --> 16:11.163
Yeah.

16:11.164 --> 16:13.365
I screwed up.

16:13.366 --> 16:14.699
Leonard's a great guy.

16:14.700 --> 16:17.669
Never should have
broken up with him.

16:17.670 --> 16:20.772
Well, uh, to paraphrase
Shakespeare:

16:20.773 --> 16:23.142
"It's better to have
loved and lost

16:23.143 --> 16:24.910
"than to stay home every night
and download

16:24.911 --> 16:28.313
increasingly shameful
pornography."

16:30.450 --> 16:33.785
Ohh... you poor baby.

16:33.786 --> 16:35.254
What's wrong with me, Penny?

16:35.255 --> 16:36.487
Nothing, nothing.

16:36.488 --> 16:37.955
You know, if we weren't friends,

16:37.956 --> 16:41.092
and you hadn't brought up
that creepy pornography story,

16:41.093 --> 16:42.493
I'd be on you like

16:42.494 --> 16:44.762
the speed of light squared
on matter to make energy.

16:44.763 --> 16:47.532
Hey, you totally got that right!

16:47.533 --> 16:49.067
"E=mc2."

16:49.068 --> 16:50.268
I listen.

16:50.269 --> 16:53.171
I have no idea what it means,
but I listen.

16:54.206 --> 16:55.874
To friendship.
To friendship.

16:55.972 --> 16:57.205
(laughs)
(glasses clink)

16:57.240 --> 17:00.075
SHELDON: Would you booze hounds
please stop that infernal clinking?!

17:03.648 --> 17:06.849
And the answer
was elephant!

17:08.219 --> 17:10.720
(slurping):
Mmm.

17:10.721 --> 17:14.156
Mmm.

17:14.157 --> 17:17.827
Leonard, sweetheart, we're
kissing, not eating hot soup.

17:18.862 --> 17:20.464
Sorry.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.434
(computer ringing)

17:24.435 --> 17:26.368
That's my parents
on video chat.

17:26.369 --> 17:27.837
Go hide
in the bedroom.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.206
Oh, come on!

17:29.207 --> 17:30.673
Why don't we just tell
them that we're dating?

17:30.674 --> 17:32.742
Oh, we've been through this.
It's not the time.

17:32.743 --> 17:33.776
When is the time?

17:33.777 --> 17:35.412
I've got five brothers
and sisters.

17:35.413 --> 17:36.779
One of them is bound
to screw up real big,

17:36.780 --> 17:39.315
and then I'll tell my parents
about you. Now, shoo.

17:39.316 --> 17:41.751
Fine.

17:41.752 --> 17:45.054
Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.

17:45.055 --> 17:47.189
We heard there was a tornado
in Kansas City.

17:47.190 --> 17:48.825
Is that close to you?

17:48.826 --> 17:50.627
No.

17:50.628 --> 17:51.628
Where is your brother?

17:51.629 --> 17:53.429
Out with friends.

17:53.430 --> 17:55.999
I don't like it, a young girl
alone in an apartment.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.868
I'll sleep so much better when
you move back here next month.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.369
You're moving
back to India?!

18:00.370 --> 18:01.871
DR. KOOTHRAPPALI:
Who's that?

18:01.872 --> 18:03.773
Oh, my God! There's someone
in your apartment.

18:03.774 --> 18:05.274
Call the police in America!

18:05.275 --> 18:07.877
When were you going
to tell <i>me</i> about this?

18:07.878 --> 18:10.078
Oh, hello, Leonard.

18:10.079 --> 18:11.579
What a pleasant surprise!

18:11.580 --> 18:14.883
Mummy, Daddy, you remember
Rajesh's friend Leonard.

18:14.884 --> 18:17.218
I thought you said Rajesh
was out with his friends.

18:17.219 --> 18:19.454
He has many friends.

18:19.455 --> 18:21.056
Rajesh has many friends?

18:22.692 --> 18:24.993
Why are you lying to us?

18:24.994 --> 18:27.295
She's lying because she doesn't
want you to know we're dating.

18:27.296 --> 18:28.797
Leonard!

18:28.798 --> 18:30.365
Well, what difference
does it make? If you're

18:30.366 --> 18:32.668
moving back to India,
we're obviously breaking up.

18:32.669 --> 18:33.768
You know what?

18:33.770 --> 18:35.391
I don't want to deal
with this right now.

18:37.439 --> 18:39.374
(door slams)

18:42.711 --> 18:45.379
So...

18:45.380 --> 18:48.248
Hot in India?

18:48.249 --> 18:51.618
Of course it is.
It always is. It's India.

18:53.221 --> 18:55.289
Now, what do you have
to say for yourself?

18:55.290 --> 18:57.291
Uh...

18:57.292 --> 18:59.560
That is a beautiful tapestry.

19:33.934 --> 19:36.635
Oh, God.

19:39.138 --> 19:41.173
(clears throat)

19:41.174 --> 19:42.775
Oh, God!

19:44.044 --> 19:45.210
Oh.

19:46.312 --> 19:47.813
Okay, look.

19:47.814 --> 19:49.314
This never happened.

19:49.315 --> 19:51.049
Do you understand me?

19:53.351 --> 19:56.020
Really?! Still
can't talk to me?

19:59.792 --> 20:01.726
What are you
doing here?

20:01.727 --> 20:02.860
What?

20:02.861 --> 20:04.762
I said, what are you doing here?

20:04.763 --> 20:06.030
I live here.

20:06.031 --> 20:09.366
I have paperwork
that says differently.

20:09.367 --> 20:11.202
(knocking on door)

20:11.203 --> 20:13.404
Priya's going back to India.

20:13.405 --> 20:14.973
Irrelevant.

20:16.308 --> 20:18.309
Rajesh and I have
a good thing going

20:18.310 --> 20:19.844
and you're not going to ruin it.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.681
What are you doing here?

20:24.682 --> 20:26.683
I've been up all night.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.885
- I had a fight with Bernadette.
- Why?

20:28.886 --> 20:31.855
She gave me
a beautiful watch.

20:34.492 --> 20:36.727
Leonard, do you
understand this?

20:36.728 --> 20:38.161
Yes.

20:38.162 --> 20:39.696
Talk to him.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.040
Damn.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.209
What's going on?

20:53.210 --> 20:55.545
Oh... (laughs)

20:55.546 --> 20:57.813
It's-it's not what
it looks like.

21:01.118 --> 21:02.852
What does it look like?
