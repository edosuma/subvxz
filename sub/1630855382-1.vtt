WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:05.171
(upbeat music)

00:08.883 --> 00:11.219
- I was single, again.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.430
- Heartbroken. Ready
to just give up.

00:13.471 --> 00:17.475
- Me too, until I
found Data Mate.

00:17.517 --> 00:21.438
I know it's the best dating
app because I work here.

00:21.479 --> 00:24.149
My team brainstorms the
thousands of questions

00:24.190 --> 00:27.027
on our app's rigorous surveys.

00:27.068 --> 00:30.321
Our engineers constantly
update our algorithm

00:30.363 --> 00:33.033
to capture your
digital heartbeat,

00:33.074 --> 00:37.203
all to find our users
love, and that includes me.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.581
- [Announcer] Data Mate,
because information

00:39.622 --> 00:42.125
will lead to the
mate that you need.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.752
Download the app now.

00:43.793 --> 00:45.337
(crowd applauds)

00:45.378 --> 00:47.797
- Woo! Yes!

00:47.839 --> 00:50.342
Now, that is fire!
- Very good.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.387
- And, Vivi, oh, Vivi.

00:54.429 --> 00:57.766
Come on! Way to use
your passion, huh?

00:57.807 --> 00:59.267
Now, how long have you and, uh-

00:59.309 --> 01:01.144
- Kenny been together?

01:01.186 --> 01:02.896
A year and a half.

01:02.937 --> 01:04.481
- OMG.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.275
You're gonna be married by
your next birthday. Life goal.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.069
- Yeah. Don't jinx it.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.363
- What if I'm manifesting it?

01:11.404 --> 01:12.864
- Oh.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.618
- And this is why Data Mate
innovates how we find love,

01:16.659 --> 01:19.412
because everybody
deserves to feel

01:19.454 --> 01:21.915
the way that our Vivi feels.
(crowd applauds)

01:21.956 --> 01:23.500
- Thank you, Adam.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.085
You know, I swear,

01:25.126 --> 01:27.796
after the boy who lived next
door and the guy from college

01:27.837 --> 01:29.923
and the blind dates and
the friends of friends, I-

01:29.964 --> 01:31.132
- [Coworker] Vivi.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.343
- Right.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.263
I'm just saying I
finally found my person!

01:37.305 --> 01:39.391
- Woo!
(crowd applauds)

01:39.432 --> 01:40.642
You see?

01:40.684 --> 01:45.355
Now, this is why we just
hit 20 million users.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.149
Mm! Great job, everybody!

01:48.983 --> 01:50.443
And this is also why

01:50.485 --> 01:54.447
we are coming back here
tonight to celebrate.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.490
Oh! Good job!

01:55.532 --> 01:58.827
(crowd applauds)
(Vivi laughs)

01:58.868 --> 01:59.703
- Thank you.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.413
(phone ringing)

02:01.454 --> 02:02.288
Oh.

02:03.331 --> 02:03.957
- Oh.

02:03.998 --> 02:04.958
- Oh.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.584
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.128
How are you?

02:08.169 --> 02:09.671
- Hi, honey.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.715
When are you getting ready
for your big party with Kenny?

02:11.756 --> 02:13.675
- I'm going home to change now.

02:13.717 --> 02:14.843
I'm excited, Mom.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.302
- You know, if your boss

02:16.344 --> 02:17.804
really wanted to celebrate
the company's success,

02:17.846 --> 02:20.140
instead of spending
money on a fancy shindig,

02:20.181 --> 02:22.142
he would give you all bonuses.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.101
You can tell him I said that.

02:23.143 --> 02:23.977
- Please, Walter.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.311
You just hate any event

02:25.353 --> 02:26.021
where you have to
tuck in your shirt.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.480
Vivi should have fun.

02:27.522 --> 02:28.398
- Here we go.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.316
- Oh, because we had so much fun

02:30.358 --> 02:32.068
at that holiday
dinner at the lodge.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.695
We got all dressed up
and paid all that money,

02:33.737 --> 02:35.280
and for what, Janice?

02:35.321 --> 02:36.156
A couple of rubbery steaks.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.366
- It was 1998. Let it go.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.244
- Mom, Dad just cares that
I'm appreciated at work.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.496
Dad, Mom just wants to make
sure that I'm not all work

02:43.538 --> 02:45.582
and can enjoy the
finer things in life.

02:45.623 --> 02:48.168
You both want
what's best from me.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.544
Love you. Bye.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.214
(Vivi sighs)

02:53.256 --> 02:54.758
- You good?

02:54.799 --> 02:56.301
- I'm great.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.763
No one can ruin today.

02:59.804 --> 03:00.597
- That's right.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.349
- Okay. I'll see you later.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.516
- Yeah.

03:03.558 --> 03:06.269
(peaceful music)

03:11.483 --> 03:13.651
(car horn blares)
- Oh!

03:13.693 --> 03:15.195
- [Stranger] Ow.

03:15.236 --> 03:18.656
- Oh no. I am so, so sorry.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.866
Are you okay?

03:19.908 --> 03:21.368
- Yeah, I think so,

03:21.409 --> 03:23.036
but that might be the
concussion speaking.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.037
(both chuckle)

03:24.079 --> 03:24.871
- Thanks.

03:24.913 --> 03:25.830
- Yeah.

03:34.089 --> 03:35.340
- What?

03:35.382 --> 03:37.050
- You were right
next to the fountain.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.593
You could have just
dropped the coin in.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.804
- It's kind of the
ideal launching spot.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.806
- Yeah, that data is great,

03:42.847 --> 03:45.433
but do all the wishes
you ever make come true?

03:47.811 --> 03:50.980
- Well, not necessarily.

03:51.022 --> 03:54.776
- Then why not toss it from
over here or over there?

03:54.818 --> 03:56.361
You know, be spontaneous.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.529
If you want different results,

03:57.570 --> 03:59.406
you gotta try
something different.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.533
- Thanks for the
generous advice.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.410
- So what are you
wishing for anyway?

04:03.451 --> 04:06.079
Come on. You owe me for
the giant lump on my head.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.664
- Fine.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.291
Well, I used to
wish to find love,

04:10.333 --> 04:14.796
and now that I have it,
I wish to optimize it.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.089
(stranger softly chuckles)

04:16.131 --> 04:17.632
- Oh, you're serious.

04:17.674 --> 04:20.885
I'm sorry. It's just,
find love and optimize it?

04:20.927 --> 04:23.096
That sounds like a robot
on Valentine's Day.

04:23.138 --> 04:25.223
- Or like me with my boyfriend.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.267
- Ah. My apologies.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.601
You know, for some folks,

04:28.643 --> 04:31.021
an aggressive stance
towards love pays off.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.773
I've seen it so many times
and I'm happy for them.

04:33.815 --> 04:38.695
- So, if my perspective
is so funny, what's yours?

04:41.239 --> 04:43.533
- I don't chase life.
I let it come to me.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.536
(Vivi chuckles)

04:46.578 --> 04:49.998
- Okay. It's not Postmates.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.962
(coin clinks)

04:56.004 --> 04:59.424
(stranger clapping)

04:59.466 --> 05:01.176
- I hope your wish comes true.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.594
- [Vivi] Yeah.

05:02.635 --> 05:07.599
(crowd chattering)
(peaceful jazz music)

05:08.808 --> 05:09.809
- I'll grab us drinks.

05:09.851 --> 05:10.685
- I'll miss you.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.773
(phone dings)

05:14.814 --> 05:16.441
(Vivi gasps)

05:16.483 --> 05:18.735
Oh, Kenny, your boss is texting.

05:23.948 --> 05:24.866
Oh.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.870
(crowd chattering)

05:36.211 --> 05:37.128
Thanks.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.718
- Whoa. What gives?

05:47.389 --> 05:49.724
- Mr. Highland.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.436
He just texted.

05:55.397 --> 05:56.481
- I'm sorry.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.942
I was gonna end things.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.695
I just didn't want you to come
to this party without a date.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.905
- Please, if you cared, you
would've said something.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.156
You wouldn't have cheated.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.952
- Okay. We still had
our good moments, right?

06:08.993 --> 06:10.662
- Then why did you cheat?

06:11.746 --> 06:12.914
- I don't know.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.916
I guess constantly
being reminded about

06:14.958 --> 06:16.876
all the ways we're far
from what your app says

06:16.918 --> 06:20.213
a successful couple should
look like and sound like.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.631
Oh, and those magazine
quizzes you love,

06:21.673 --> 06:23.383
which say we're falling
short in one way or another.

06:23.425 --> 06:24.509
(Vivi chuckles)

06:24.551 --> 06:26.094
- Is anything ever your fault?

06:26.136 --> 06:29.514
- You looked at a message you
thought was from my boss. Why?

06:31.099 --> 06:32.058
- No.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.563
You do not get to make
yourself the victim.

06:38.314 --> 06:39.774
I wanted love

06:40.692 --> 06:41.901
with someone who wanted it too

06:41.943 --> 06:43.486
and who was willing
to put in the work

06:43.528 --> 06:44.738
so that we could have

06:44.779 --> 06:46.489
the relationship that
we dreamed about,

06:46.531 --> 06:48.950
and I still do want that,

06:51.536 --> 06:52.912
but not with you.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.292
(solemn music)

06:57.334 --> 06:59.961
(Vivi scoffs)

07:01.629 --> 07:05.091
That was our one-year
anniversary in Hawaii

07:05.133 --> 07:07.969
and this is my birthday.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.221
Whatever.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.561
- Come on. That's enough.

07:19.314 --> 07:22.942
Look, we've got the
three post-breakup Rs.

07:22.984 --> 07:27.113
Red, reality, and
ripping to shreds.

07:28.490 --> 07:29.991
You are gonna be all right.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.746
- I couldn't see what was right
in front of me for so long.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.625
I think I just need to stay
here for a little while.

07:40.335 --> 07:43.797
I am taking all of my sick days.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.800
(gentle music)

07:46.841 --> 07:49.219
(lively music)

07:56.059 --> 07:58.478
(lively music continues)

07:58.520 --> 08:00.021
Oh!
- Oh, welcome back!

08:00.063 --> 08:01.022
- Ooh!

08:02.440 --> 08:04.484
Is it weird that I'm
nervous to go back upstairs?

08:04.526 --> 08:07.570
- Oh, don't be. It's
been two months, okay?

08:07.612 --> 08:11.032
No one even remembers the
whole you and Kenny thing.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.914
Okay, so maybe some people

08:17.956 --> 08:21.126
might vaguely recall
something, but-

08:21.167 --> 08:22.210
- It's fine.

08:23.962 --> 08:28.049
What really matters is that I
used Data Mate the right way.

08:28.091 --> 08:32.470
It should have worked, but it
didn't, and I wanna know why.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.931
- Then let's check with
the analytics team.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.182
They're so nerdy,

08:36.224 --> 08:38.143
they make us engineers
seem borderline cool.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.687
(both chuckle)

08:40.729 --> 08:43.064
- [Vivi] Hey, Dom.
How's it going?

08:43.106 --> 08:45.191
- Vivi, I'm so sorry.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.776
- Thanks.

08:46.818 --> 08:50.280
Actually, I've been pondering
a question for weeks.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.533
How did Data Mate
go wrong for me?

08:53.575 --> 08:55.368
- Oh, it's not just you.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.120
(somber music)

08:57.162 --> 09:00.165
From how often previous
users rejoin the app,

09:00.206 --> 09:04.961
success rate of a relationship
of a year is roughly 20%.

09:08.048 --> 09:08.923
- That's it?

09:11.259 --> 09:12.552
How?

09:12.594 --> 09:14.929
Is it a flaw in the algorithm,

09:14.971 --> 09:18.641
or is it the questions
my team creates?

09:18.683 --> 09:21.561
- Our app makes hundreds of
millions of dollars a year.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.813
I don't think anyone
would consider it flawed.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.611
- Okay. Thanks, Dom.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.701
I thought I could conquer love.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.828
Data Mate gave me hope
and then it failed,

09:38.870 --> 09:41.706
'cause that's what it does.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.709
- There are other
ways to meet guys.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.295
- What is the point, Nila?

09:47.337 --> 09:49.089
I have tried everything.

09:49.130 --> 09:52.425
I just wanted love, to
build a great relationship,

09:52.467 --> 09:54.260
and maybe even a family one day.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.847
At this point, forget being
married by my next birthday.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.308
Now, it is about
not dying alone.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.727
Oh, is this why people get cats?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.771
- Okay. I know what you need.

10:04.813 --> 10:07.399
Some hedonistic
housewives hating.

10:09.359 --> 10:13.029
- Change the channel. I will
literally watch anything else.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.198
- [Narrator] One of the
world's greatest matchmakers,

10:15.240 --> 10:16.282
Raina Kumar.

10:17.575 --> 10:21.121
- What show is this?
It's all so beautiful.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.622
- [Narrator] Utilizing
Indian traditions

10:22.664 --> 10:24.416
from over thousands of years,

10:24.457 --> 10:26.543
Raina finds her
clients happiness.

10:26.584 --> 10:30.130
- My methods are a bit
ancient in some ways,

10:30.171 --> 10:33.133
even in India, yet
modern in others,

10:33.174 --> 10:35.927
but I believe in the
purpose behind each facet,

10:35.969 --> 10:41.016
which is why 95% of my clients
enjoy lifelong relationships.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.018
- [Both] Oh.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.771
- If that number's
real, she's it.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.898
Raina Kumar is how
we improve Data Mate

10:48.940 --> 10:51.359
so it actually
finds people love!

10:51.401 --> 10:53.153
- But would she be interested?

10:53.194 --> 10:55.488
(gentle music)

10:55.530 --> 10:56.781
- Let's find out.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.204
- [Raina] Thank you.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.164
- Oh!

11:05.415 --> 11:08.501
- Ms. Kumar, so glad you
could make it. I'm Vivi.

11:08.543 --> 11:11.796
- And I'm a huge fan named Nila.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.715
- Oh, please, call me Raina.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.842
- Here's chai.

11:17.719 --> 11:21.473
I have watched your show
nonstop the last week,

11:21.514 --> 11:24.351
and I learned just
how you like it.

11:24.392 --> 11:28.188
- Oh, I'm flattered and
perhaps a little concerned.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.856
(group chuckles)

11:29.898 --> 11:32.067
I read the materials
your company sent me,

11:32.108 --> 11:35.653
but, to be frank, I'm not
sure how I could help.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.238
- Well, from your show,

11:37.280 --> 11:40.533
I know your matchmaking
tradition is by
Indians for Indians,

11:40.575 --> 11:41.826
but we will pay generously

11:41.868 --> 11:44.829
for you to consult with
us for three months.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.956
We'd like an inside
look at your process.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.792
Then, we would digitize it,

11:48.833 --> 11:51.002
create analogous inputs
for our algorithm,

11:51.044 --> 11:53.380
and evaluate success
via analytics.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.881
- I don't know those words.

11:54.923 --> 11:57.967
What I know are biodata,
rashi, and guna.

11:58.009 --> 12:00.303
- And I don't know those words.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.430
- Thank you. Sorry I'm late.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.307
- Oh, meet my son, Bhumesh.

12:04.349 --> 12:07.268
Bhumesh, this is Nila and Vivi.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.186
- Please, call me Boom.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.312
- Hi.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.439
- And Vivi and I already met.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.732
How are things
with the boyfriend?

12:12.774 --> 12:14.150
- Ex-boyfriend.

12:14.192 --> 12:17.278
- Oh, I guess we didn't
optimize love after all.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.491
(Vivi nervously chuckles)

12:21.533 --> 12:23.868
- How is he involved
in all of this?

12:23.910 --> 12:25.870
- Oh, Bhumesh runs the business.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.123
He has an MBA from Wharton.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.001
- Classic Indian mom moment.

12:32.627 --> 12:35.964
- Raina, I know you
have a successful show,

12:36.006 --> 12:39.718
but dating apps are
only growing worldwide.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.761
Has it affected your
business at all?

12:41.803 --> 12:43.471
- We're already
starting to plateau.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.056
There's a real merit to us

12:45.098 --> 12:47.767
getting in with an app on our
term before it's too late.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.602
It's like I keep saying, Mom.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.688
we have to make our
matchmaking traditions

12:51.730 --> 12:54.232
more accessible
to today's users.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.027
Respect the past, but
eyes toward the future.

12:57.068 --> 13:00.321
- We want to find our
singles love just like you.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.906
If you work with us, Raina,

13:01.948 --> 13:04.909
our service will get better and
you'll get on users' radars.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.078
Our clientele use multiple apps.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.955
- Oh.
- Say you develop one.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.291
- Which I've been
advocating for.

13:11.332 --> 13:15.295
- You'd be among our users
go-tos. It's a win-win.

13:15.337 --> 13:20.342
- Thank you, Vivi, but I
cannot reduce my matchmaking

13:21.092 --> 13:23.053
to zeros and ones for Data Mate.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.638
It has to be experienced,

13:25.680 --> 13:27.140
and if that means that, one day,

13:27.182 --> 13:29.809
we have to close
our doors, so be it.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.354
I cannot short
change the process.

13:33.396 --> 13:34.230
Thank you.

13:34.272 --> 13:35.190
- Wait.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.525
What if I hire someone

13:37.567 --> 13:40.487
to go through your matchmaking
process from start to finish

13:40.528 --> 13:42.030
like any other client?

13:42.072 --> 13:44.783
- Mom, the process
would get its due,

13:44.824 --> 13:46.034
and Data Mate can make

13:46.076 --> 13:48.328
meaningful and informed
changes to their app,

13:48.370 --> 13:51.790
and if they improve, then
we take all the credit.

13:51.831 --> 13:55.126
This can set us up
beautifully for the future.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.546
- The person we choose to go
through my matchmaking process

13:58.588 --> 14:00.340
must want a life partner now.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.133
- Of course. I can't
be the only one.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.052
- Someone who
respects our culture.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.970
- It's not a fad.
It's a tradition.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.472
- I've taught her well.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.058
- And they should have

14:10.100 --> 14:12.686
an open mind and heart
about matchmaking.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.270
- Agreed.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.940
If they are like me, they will
try anything that can work.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.945
So, can I find a test user?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.363
- I already have.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.824
- Me?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.367
- That could work.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.703
This could be the start of us
tapping a whole new market,

14:29.744 --> 14:31.955
our matchmaking for non-Indians.

14:31.996 --> 14:36.835
- Most importantly, we'll
bring more love to more people,

14:36.876 --> 14:38.378
starting with Vivi.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.425
- I want love,

14:43.466 --> 14:45.802
but I don't know.

14:45.844 --> 14:48.430
- Okay, we'll prepare
you, then you decide.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.182
- "We'll"?

14:51.224 --> 14:52.600
- We'll.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.728
I'm also a client concierge.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.688
I'll be with you
every step of the way.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.941
We're gonna have so much fun.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.068
- Yeah.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.448
- You wouldn't apply for a
job without a proper resume.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.908
Biodata is like
that for marriage.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.368
- Some biodatas ask for

15:10.410 --> 15:12.912
physical characteristics
or things like caste,

15:12.954 --> 15:14.247
but we're more modern.

15:14.289 --> 15:19.377
- Actually, I took
a couple swings.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.545
- [Raina] Ooh!

15:21.796 --> 15:23.757
- Your GPA, your credit score,

15:23.798 --> 15:25.759
and your last work
performance review?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.052
- It was stellar.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.179
- This is only what you've done.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.306
- Oh, the next
one is my fun one.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.560
- "Five things I would take
if I were stuck on the moon."

15:35.602 --> 15:39.147
- Does she think she's an
astronaut or Elon Musk?

15:40.106 --> 15:42.317
- But that was in my
favorite dating column.

15:43.318 --> 15:46.321
- We'll just save
these for later.

15:49.949 --> 15:53.328
- Vivi, this process
has to be personal.

15:53.370 --> 15:55.955
You gotta write about you,
the things that make you tick,

15:55.997 --> 15:58.249
how a potential
partner would view you.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.086
- I have to think about it.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.504
- While you're thinking,

16:02.545 --> 16:06.007
be sure to add any core
expectations for a marriage.

16:06.049 --> 16:08.885
Dynamic, communication,
children.

16:08.927 --> 16:13.556
- Wait, you want me to
talk about kids now?

16:13.598 --> 16:14.516
- [Raina] Of course.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.270
(Vivi sighs)

16:19.312 --> 16:20.188
- Boom,

16:22.148 --> 16:23.983
how would you fill yours out?

16:24.025 --> 16:26.069
- Uh, uh, uh. I
don't have a biodata.

16:26.111 --> 16:28.279
- Hello, client concierge.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.698
- Fine.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.992
I'd say I'm mature, preferring
to think through life.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.203
- You mean too cool for school?

16:35.245 --> 16:38.123
But I'm a total go-getter.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.582
- So you think I'm cool, huh?

16:39.624 --> 16:41.167
- Keep going.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.503
- A partner could view me as
reliable, dedicated to us.

16:43.545 --> 16:46.715
- But I make even the
mundane memorable.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.508
- Oh, your biodatas
certainly were.

16:48.550 --> 16:51.094
- Okay. What about
for a partnership?

16:51.136 --> 16:52.679
- We would have to
be a team of equals,

16:52.721 --> 16:55.515
and for every rough interaction
we have as a couple-

16:55.557 --> 16:58.393
- There should be five good
ones, like the Gottmans say.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.396
- That's how it
was for my folks.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.024
- Sounds really nice.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.400
- Finish later.

17:08.319 --> 17:11.531
She's reading your palm for
your traits and love destiny.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.159
It's an old tradition
not everyone does.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.619
- But you seem so pragmatic.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.413
- And, pragmatically speaking,

17:18.455 --> 17:21.916
every relationship
requires a little luck.

17:21.958 --> 17:24.210
This might nudge us in
the right direction.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.172
- She will find a
deep, lasting love,

17:27.213 --> 17:28.548
and it will come through

17:28.590 --> 17:31.509
a mother-like figure
that she trusts.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.553
- Meaning I am going to
fall in love with a guy

17:33.595 --> 17:36.056
through Raina, and that means
I can fix Data Mate too!

17:36.097 --> 17:38.099
- Okay, slow down there, turbo.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.602
First, you have to be
honest at all times.

17:40.643 --> 17:43.396
Second, you have to give
each guy a fair chance,

17:43.438 --> 17:45.482
because chemistry
isn't always instant.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.608
- Sometimes it is.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.361
- But no hanky-panky, hm?

17:49.402 --> 17:51.946
And, remember, finding
a winning relationship

17:51.988 --> 17:54.407
goes beyond statistics
and surveys.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.202
Are you willing to see
things in a new way?

17:57.243 --> 18:00.622
- Yes. Raina, match me, please.

18:01.831 --> 18:02.791
(Raina chuckles)

18:02.832 --> 18:03.792
- [Raina] Okay.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.336
(group chuckles)

18:11.716 --> 18:14.469
- Data Mate's famous for
our red flag ratings.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.846
Users love deal-breakers.

18:16.888 --> 18:20.350
- "Do they wear white
socks outside of the gym?"

18:20.392 --> 18:23.061
This is my karma
from a past life.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.729
- I think what mom means is that

18:24.771 --> 18:27.482
none of this gauges a
relationship's potential.

18:27.524 --> 18:28.942
- Focus on practical matters

18:28.983 --> 18:31.820
you must find out from a
potential partner early on

18:31.861 --> 18:32.946
and know for yourself.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.364
- Practical matters like what?

18:34.406 --> 18:36.491
- What kind of luxuries
do you want in life?

18:36.533 --> 18:38.618
What's your view on finances?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.203
What mix of togetherness,

18:40.245 --> 18:42.956
going out socially as a couple
and alone time do you need?

18:42.997 --> 18:44.332
- Hm.

18:44.374 --> 18:47.210
- I guess I always
just assumed that,

18:47.252 --> 18:49.337
once I had the right partner,

18:49.379 --> 18:51.881
these things would just
work themselves out.

18:51.923 --> 18:55.301
- Or maybe determining the
answers to these questions

18:55.343 --> 18:57.846
is how you find
the right partner.

18:57.887 --> 19:01.349
(Vivi softly chuckles)

19:01.391 --> 19:02.475
- Welcome.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.478
Seeing how you live

19:05.520 --> 19:07.814
tells me things about you
that you may not realize.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.567
- Oh. Make yourself at home.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.154
- Here's one successful
relationship.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.657
Is your place being
used as a cold storage?

19:17.699 --> 19:20.201
- You wish you could
optimize space like me.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.955
- Vivi, do you remember that
talk we had when we first met

19:23.997 --> 19:25.957
about how, if you want
something different,

19:25.999 --> 19:29.627
then you need to do something
different, like adding color?

19:29.669 --> 19:32.047
- No. What does that have
to do with matching me?

19:32.088 --> 19:34.549
- If you can't try something
different in your own home,

19:34.591 --> 19:36.551
how are you gonna
do it in romance?

19:37.844 --> 19:40.138
- I really don't like
when you make good points.

19:41.348 --> 19:44.017
Fine. You can do
anything you like.

19:44.059 --> 19:48.605
You can even look in my closet.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.315
- [Boom] Why were these
buried in the closet?

19:50.357 --> 19:51.941
- I don't know.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.693
They're from a long time ago
and they don't quite fit.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.738
- [Boom] Wanna try one?

19:56.780 --> 19:57.322
- Sure.

19:57.364 --> 20:00.116
(gentle music)

20:03.495 --> 20:06.289
- Tell me about
your dating history.

20:06.331 --> 20:08.124
- Does that really matter?

20:08.166 --> 20:09.709
- No, not at all,

20:09.751 --> 20:12.754
as long as you're okay
making the same mistakes.

20:14.005 --> 20:17.592
- Okay. Well, my first
boyfriend was in high school.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.302
Billy, the neighbor's son.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.596
He was actually really sweet,

20:21.638 --> 20:24.057
and then I realized he had
me doing all of his homework.

20:24.099 --> 20:26.142
- Hah! That's rough.

20:27.686 --> 20:29.979
- Don't you have
something to fix?

20:30.021 --> 20:32.524
- [Boom] Yeah, if you'll
help me move some furniture.

20:33.858 --> 20:38.905
- Okay. This is me being
spontaneous and open-minded.

20:40.281 --> 20:43.618
- Your condo is ready for
your new journey to better.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.579
- You know, you're
really good at this.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.040
- Was that a compliment?

20:50.291 --> 20:51.835
- Just for that,

20:51.876 --> 20:53.169
it is your turn to talk about
your past relationships.

20:53.211 --> 20:55.088
- Don't say relationships.

20:55.130 --> 20:58.341
It's been so long since you
brought a girl to see me.

20:58.383 --> 21:00.844
- Classic Indian mom moment.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.596
- These bachelorettes are
open to meeting Bhumesh.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.265
You can swipe.

21:05.306 --> 21:09.102
- This is where the line blurs
between matchmaker and mom.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.478
- Whoa!

21:10.520 --> 21:12.022
They're beautiful.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.524
- And smart and successful and
total winners, all of them.

21:14.566 --> 21:17.902
I'm just not in a place for it.

21:21.906 --> 21:23.575
I have to keep the family
business afloat, don't I?

21:23.616 --> 21:26.369
- Oh, is this when the
kids say "whatever"?

21:26.411 --> 21:27.662
- Moving on.

21:27.704 --> 21:30.373
Vivi, there's just one
more thing we need.

21:30.415 --> 21:31.708
Family background.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.377
- Ah. How was growing
up with your parents?

21:34.419 --> 21:35.712
- Uh.

21:35.754 --> 21:37.714
- Actually, we'll just
ask them when we meet.

21:37.756 --> 21:38.882
- Great.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.508
(Raina speaks in
foreign language)

21:40.550 --> 21:41.509
- Now?

21:41.551 --> 21:42.969
- [Raina] Of course. Let's go.

21:44.137 --> 21:44.971
- Coming.

21:45.889 --> 21:47.974
(Vivi sighs)
(gentle music)

21:48.016 --> 21:52.771
- Anyway, we love that
you are matching Vivi,

21:52.812 --> 21:54.898
but what has that
got to do with us?

21:54.939 --> 21:57.984
- Oh, it's not only
Vivi getting married.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.778
- Huh? Come again?

21:59.819 --> 22:04.157
- You two and your relationship
with Vivi will be affected.

22:04.199 --> 22:07.911
Finding the right partner
is about you as well.

22:07.952 --> 22:10.914
- Can you tell us how things
were from her childhood to now?

22:10.955 --> 22:11.998
- Oh.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.124
- So good.

22:14.209 --> 22:16.920
My parents were so present

22:16.961 --> 22:19.297
and I always knew
they were around

22:20.298 --> 22:22.133
and that really sums it up.

22:22.175 --> 22:24.135
- Aw. She's such
a great daughter.

22:24.177 --> 22:26.179
Big heart. Hard worker.

22:26.221 --> 22:28.181
Never got in trouble.

22:28.223 --> 22:30.141
- Walter, are you okay?

22:30.183 --> 22:31.851
- Oh, it's my back.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.353
It only likes my recliner.

22:34.646 --> 22:37.023
Oh, it's hidden in the closet.

22:37.065 --> 22:40.068
- Because we have company
and it's an eyesore.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.070
- You see, when
people come over,

22:42.112 --> 22:43.613
Janice wants the
place to look like

22:43.655 --> 22:44.781
no one actually lives here.

22:44.823 --> 22:46.449
- Oh, no.
- Guys!

22:46.491 --> 22:48.368
I appreciate you both

22:48.410 --> 22:52.205
trying to make the place
welcoming for Raina and Boom.

22:52.247 --> 22:54.958
- Such zesty people.

22:55.000 --> 22:55.834
(group laughs)

22:55.875 --> 22:56.960
- Why don't we switch gears?

22:57.002 --> 22:58.878
What would you like
in a son-in-law?

23:00.255 --> 23:03.508
- Let's add a field for
users to specifically say

23:03.550 --> 23:05.760
why they'd make a good
partner for someone else

23:05.802 --> 23:07.971
and for users to answer

23:08.013 --> 23:10.473
why previous relationships
didn't work out.

23:10.515 --> 23:11.933
- Spicy.

23:11.975 --> 23:15.770
Oh, and maybe we change
the input around red flags?

23:15.812 --> 23:18.356
- So we're adding new questions?

23:18.398 --> 23:20.150
- We're just updating inputs,

23:20.191 --> 23:22.027
keeping things fresh
with the new questions.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.446
- Yeah, for the users
that don't care about it.

23:25.613 --> 23:28.658
- Okay, but maybe
these are questions

23:28.700 --> 23:30.493
they should care about.

23:30.535 --> 23:32.328
You approved hiring Raina.

23:32.370 --> 23:35.874
- Hey, hey, I approved
briefly consulting with Raina.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.084
That was really just a PR
push for the bottom line.

23:38.126 --> 23:39.669
- Well, these
questions stem from

23:39.711 --> 23:41.254
what I'm learning with her.

23:41.296 --> 23:44.424
I think they'll significantly
increase our user success rate

23:44.466 --> 23:49.471
and more user success means
word of mouth and more profit.

23:52.015 --> 23:54.809
- Okay, but you
have a short leash,

23:54.851 --> 23:57.145
especially if I'm not
gonna see results.

23:57.187 --> 23:58.521
- You got it.

23:58.563 --> 24:03.401
(exciting music)
(team shouting)

24:08.239 --> 24:09.407
(exciting music continues)
(Boom grunts)

24:09.449 --> 24:11.284
(team cheers)

24:11.326 --> 24:12.452
- [Boom] Yeah!

24:14.287 --> 24:15.246
Nice job.

24:17.332 --> 24:19.751
Good stuff, good stuff. Nice.

24:23.338 --> 24:24.214
Hey!

24:24.255 --> 24:25.298
- [Vivi] Hey.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.466
- What are you doing over here?

24:26.508 --> 24:29.427
- I went a new way
and it led me here.

24:29.469 --> 24:30.845
(Boom chuckles)

24:30.887 --> 24:32.847
So you're a soccer champion?

24:32.889 --> 24:34.307
- Oh, hardly, no, no.

24:34.349 --> 24:35.642
I come to the park every week

24:35.684 --> 24:37.811
and just see what
piques my interest.

24:37.852 --> 24:40.605
Sometimes, it's archery.
Other times, it's cricket.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.399
Today, they just
needed an extra player,

24:42.440 --> 24:44.776
and it was a game to raise
funds for foster kids.

24:44.818 --> 24:46.861
I mean, I couldn't
say no to that.

24:48.113 --> 24:53.243
- That's really admirable,
Boom, and very impromptu.

24:54.244 --> 24:55.620
- And you never
would've seen it,

24:55.662 --> 24:56.746
except you took a
different route.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.915
- Oh no. Are you
rubbing off on me?

24:58.957 --> 25:00.750
- You want an
autograph, don't you?

25:00.792 --> 25:02.252
Guys, she wants my autograph.

25:02.293 --> 25:05.213
- Calm down. I am
taking baby steps.

25:05.255 --> 25:06.923
(Boom chuckles)

25:06.965 --> 25:09.175
- You'll be taking much
bigger steps than that.

25:09.217 --> 25:12.178
You'll see soon
enough. Anyway, ta-ta.

25:12.220 --> 25:13.138
- Bye.

25:14.764 --> 25:16.933
Wait, bigger steps?

25:25.108 --> 25:26.359
Come. Come.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.820
- Is this really necessary?

25:28.862 --> 25:30.280
- If your families don't match,

25:30.321 --> 25:32.824
your relationship will
be a battle every day.

25:32.866 --> 25:34.451
- Why are you being like this?

25:34.492 --> 25:35.869
I'm telling you.

25:35.910 --> 25:36.995
Your sister never apologized
for calling me a yokel.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.288
- Yes, she did.

25:39.330 --> 25:42.167
- Paul, you are
so well-mannered.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.627
- Oh, being courteous was
drilled into me as a child.

25:44.669 --> 25:47.255
- You know, my friends think
I'm crazy for doing this,

25:47.297 --> 25:49.674
but I think I'd be crazy not to.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.801
- So that's what I've
spent the last few years

25:51.843 --> 25:53.136
doing at Data Mate.

25:53.178 --> 25:54.804
- You've been diving
into the data of love,

25:54.846 --> 25:56.348
not treating it like magic.

25:56.389 --> 25:59.017
- Exactly. I don't want dating
to rely so much on luck.

25:59.059 --> 26:01.394
Tell me about your
love languages.

26:01.436 --> 26:03.605
English and first-year German.

26:03.646 --> 26:04.481
- Uh.

26:04.522 --> 26:06.149
(upbeat music)

26:06.191 --> 26:07.776
- Okay, let me
balance things out.

26:07.817 --> 26:11.237
Here's a strength of yours.
You're great at deflecting.

26:11.279 --> 26:13.365
- Oh, better than being the
guy whose literal job is

26:13.406 --> 26:16.368
to find people commitment
while refusing it himself.

26:18.036 --> 26:19.746
- So much of a good relationship

26:19.788 --> 26:22.707
is treating each other well
in the small moments, so.

26:22.749 --> 26:23.750
Oops!

26:23.792 --> 26:24.709
May I have a napkin, please?

26:24.751 --> 26:25.669
- Yeah.

26:27.045 --> 26:27.879
Walter!

26:27.921 --> 26:28.838
- What?

26:28.880 --> 26:31.007
- Thank you so much.

26:31.049 --> 26:32.175
- You can tell me
about your Enneagram.

26:32.217 --> 26:33.510
- Enneagram?

26:33.551 --> 26:35.637
- You know what's worked
for a few years longer

26:35.679 --> 26:38.640
than relationship
pop psychology?

26:38.682 --> 26:40.308
Getting to know someone.

26:41.351 --> 26:43.186
Show your human side.

26:43.228 --> 26:45.313
My life at the hedge
fund is algorithms, data,

26:45.355 --> 26:47.315
pattern recognition,
predictive models.

26:47.357 --> 26:50.276
- Wow. That is music to my ears.

26:50.318 --> 26:52.737
- You know, there's
this feeling I get

26:52.779 --> 26:54.406
when I'm out in nature,

26:54.447 --> 26:57.033
like when I'm gazing
out at the ocean

26:57.075 --> 27:00.078
or taking in a view
from the mountaintop.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.455
I get these butterflies
in my stomach

27:02.497 --> 27:04.165
and my heart starts to race.

27:04.207 --> 27:05.917
Somehow, I'm so at peace.

27:05.959 --> 27:07.877
I know, it sounds cheesy, but-

27:07.919 --> 27:09.379
- No, not at all.

27:10.422 --> 27:12.924
- I want that with
another person.

27:12.966 --> 27:14.843
- I understand.

27:14.884 --> 27:18.179
My forehead gets warm when
I see that special someone.

27:18.221 --> 27:23.351
(Vivi awkwardly chuckles)
(upbeat music)

27:25.228 --> 27:29.691
- [Raina] So, it's
been a full three days.

27:29.733 --> 27:31.192
Who stood out?

27:31.234 --> 27:33.069
- Well, I mean, Tristan.

27:33.111 --> 27:34.738
(group chuckles)

27:34.779 --> 27:37.949
And Paul and Leonard,
I like the dynamic.

27:37.991 --> 27:39.451
- Wonderful.

27:39.492 --> 27:42.370
Bhumesh and I will take care
of setting up the dates,

27:42.412 --> 27:44.706
but you've done very well.

27:44.748 --> 27:46.791
Let's celebrate.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.878
Come to my home for a
traditional Indian dinner.

27:51.004 --> 27:52.630
- I wouldn't want to impose.

27:52.672 --> 27:54.507
- Bhumesh, you
don't mind, do you?

27:54.549 --> 27:57.969
- Uh, no, no, no, not at all.

27:58.011 --> 27:59.262
- Thank you.

27:59.304 --> 28:02.390
(peaceful music)

28:04.267 --> 28:08.563
(Raina singing in
foreign language)

28:14.152 --> 28:17.781
(peaceful music continues)

28:25.413 --> 28:27.916
- I didn't realize
Dad's been gone so long.

28:30.335 --> 28:32.045
- You would know if you visited

28:32.087 --> 28:35.465
Dad's side of the family
in India since he passed.

28:35.507 --> 28:38.677
You won't even step foot
into the pooja room since.

28:41.012 --> 28:42.514
- In our culture,

28:42.555 --> 28:46.309
it is parents' duty to see
their children settled.

28:46.351 --> 28:48.687
Pratik did not get the chance,

28:48.728 --> 28:53.149
but it was his last
wish to see you married.

28:53.191 --> 28:55.443
It's my wish for you too.

28:55.485 --> 28:56.945
- Because it's tradition?

28:56.986 --> 29:01.741
- No, because it's what
will make you truly happy.

29:03.118 --> 29:06.246
It worries me that all you
do is date superficially.

29:06.287 --> 29:09.416
The boy we raised is
deeper than that, no?

29:09.457 --> 29:10.834
Is there something
you don't like about

29:10.875 --> 29:12.752
the women I tried
to connect you with?

29:12.794 --> 29:14.671
You've dated Indian
women before.

29:14.713 --> 29:17.549
- Of course I have, and
non-Indian women too.

29:17.590 --> 29:18.967
That's not it at all.

29:19.009 --> 29:19.801
- Then what?
- Okay.

29:19.843 --> 29:21.052
What are you afraid of?

29:21.094 --> 29:23.013
(junk clatters)

29:23.054 --> 29:25.056
Vivi must be here.

29:25.098 --> 29:25.974
Vivi!

29:26.016 --> 29:27.267
- [Vivi] Hi!

29:27.308 --> 29:29.519
- [Raina] Oh, leave it,
leave it. No problem.

29:30.228 --> 29:32.355
- Sorry. The door was open, I-

29:32.397 --> 29:34.190
- [Raina] Of course
it was open, for you.

29:34.232 --> 29:35.233
Leave it, leave it, leave it.

29:35.275 --> 29:36.484
- Are you sure?

29:36.526 --> 29:37.527
- Come.
- Okay.

29:37.569 --> 29:38.236
- Hi.

29:38.278 --> 29:39.863
- [Raina] Hi.

29:39.904 --> 29:41.698
(gentle music)

29:41.740 --> 29:45.994
- [Vivi] Mm, Raina, that
aroma, I am drooling.

29:46.036 --> 29:48.788
- It's korma. It was
Pratik's favorite.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.498
- Please, let me.

29:53.543 --> 29:55.086
- No recipe required.

29:55.128 --> 29:58.631
(Raina and Vivi chuckle)

29:58.673 --> 30:01.259
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:01.301 --> 30:03.511
(Vivi sighs)

30:03.553 --> 30:05.096
- Bhum's a good son.

30:05.138 --> 30:06.389
- He's okay.

30:06.431 --> 30:07.849
(Vivi and Boom chuckle)

30:07.891 --> 30:10.393
- You think he can
handle that korma though?

30:10.435 --> 30:13.480
- Well, the best
dishes are more than

30:13.521 --> 30:15.982
just a list of ingredients
and instructions.

30:16.024 --> 30:17.484
- [Vivi] Hm.

30:17.525 --> 30:19.652
- What also matters is the
freshness of the spices,

30:19.694 --> 30:21.863
the interplay of pan and flame,

30:21.905 --> 30:24.866
and, of course, the
cook's own skill.

30:24.908 --> 30:26.242
(Vivi chuckles)

30:26.284 --> 30:27.410
- [Boom] Subtle, Mom.

30:27.452 --> 30:29.120
- Metaphors are
always on the menu.

30:29.162 --> 30:31.247
(Vivi and Raina chuckle)

30:31.289 --> 30:32.707
- Raina, tell me.

30:32.749 --> 30:36.002
Were you and Pratik more
than just ingredients?

30:36.044 --> 30:38.338
- Oh, yes.
(gentle music)

30:38.380 --> 30:42.717
Actually, we met through
my family's matchmaker.

30:43.802 --> 30:45.845
Arranged marriages
come in all types,

30:45.887 --> 30:50.975
but, to me, what I do,
matchmaking, is more than that.

30:52.143 --> 30:53.561
- How so?

30:53.603 --> 30:54.854
- Well, it's a marriage

30:54.896 --> 30:57.607
considered with immense
care for the families,

30:57.649 --> 31:01.152
but love between pride
and groom is the priority.

31:01.194 --> 31:02.153
- [Vivi] Hm.

31:02.195 --> 31:03.780
- Like with me and Pratik.

31:03.822 --> 31:05.448
You know, we came
to this country

31:05.490 --> 31:07.534
to build a life and a family,

31:07.575 --> 31:11.996
leaving behind everything
from India except each other.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.958
(Raina and Vivi chuckle)

31:15.000 --> 31:18.378
We didn't have any money,
but Pratik would always rent

31:18.420 --> 31:21.047
the latest Bollywood
films for us to watch,

31:21.089 --> 31:24.718
and he would sing all of
our favorite songs to me

31:24.759 --> 31:27.595
and make me chai every morning.

31:27.637 --> 31:32.225
(Raina chuckles)
(gentle music)

31:32.267 --> 31:36.021
- I know you both must have
loved each other very much.

31:37.647 --> 31:40.025
That's what I want
from all of this.

31:41.359 --> 31:43.319
- We will find it.

31:43.361 --> 31:44.237
- I hope so.

31:44.279 --> 31:47.032
(Raina chuckles)

31:49.200 --> 31:50.618
- Dinner is served.

31:52.245 --> 31:55.206
- Mm. This is beyond delicious.

31:56.708 --> 31:58.835
- You know, Priya and
Amit's engagement ceremony

31:58.877 --> 32:00.045
is almost here.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.463
- They're a great
couple Mom matched.

32:01.504 --> 32:02.881
- Hm.

32:02.922 --> 32:04.382
- Join us.

32:04.424 --> 32:07.594
It's been so long since you
attended a client's event.

32:07.635 --> 32:09.220
- I'd love to, Mom,

32:09.262 --> 32:11.723
but I just snagged tickets to
our concert that same night.

32:11.765 --> 32:13.058
Gotta seize the moment.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.643
- Sure. Okay, son.

32:20.231 --> 32:21.649
- Ah! Mom!

32:21.691 --> 32:24.694
Actually, I'll think about it

32:24.736 --> 32:27.072
in case the concert
gets canceled.

32:28.281 --> 32:30.992
(Raina chuckles)

32:31.034 --> 32:32.494
(Vivi chuckles)

32:32.535 --> 32:35.372
Vivi, if the food's too hot,
you can eat some yogurt.

32:35.413 --> 32:36.998
No need to be a hero.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.751
- Oh, I'm good. Thanks.

32:40.752 --> 32:43.546
- Oh. How'd you get
into spicy food?

32:43.588 --> 32:44.798
- From traveling, mostly.

32:44.839 --> 32:46.341
- What? I love traveling.

32:46.383 --> 32:47.258
Columbia.

32:48.677 --> 32:50.220
- That's on my list.

32:50.261 --> 32:53.556
The last few places I went
were Mexico, Ghana, Indonesia.

32:53.598 --> 32:54.849
- Did you love the sambal there?

32:54.891 --> 32:57.894
- Oh, every kind. Tell
me you went to Bali.

32:57.936 --> 33:00.105
- Like you have to ask. Did
you try all the local produce?

33:00.146 --> 33:02.232
- Is there any better
reason for traveling?

33:02.273 --> 33:04.734
- If you included this kind of
stuff in your dating profile,

33:04.776 --> 33:07.237
the stuff that you love, the
stuff that makes you you,

33:07.278 --> 33:09.948
you would've found the
right guy a long time ago.

33:10.824 --> 33:13.952
- Oh. I hope I still can.

33:13.993 --> 33:16.955
- You will. This is
a nice side of you.

33:16.996 --> 33:19.416
- Hm. At least one of
us has a nice side.

33:19.457 --> 33:21.835
(Boom chuckles)

33:25.547 --> 33:26.506
Okay, not bad!

33:26.548 --> 33:27.382
(Boom laughs)

33:27.424 --> 33:28.800
- I'm sorry. Were you trying?

33:28.842 --> 33:31.344
- Uh-huh! Keep
telling yourself that!

33:31.386 --> 33:32.303
Oh my gosh.

33:33.972 --> 33:36.224
- Hey, about this weekend.

33:36.266 --> 33:38.393
I'm gonna find
something fun and light

33:38.435 --> 33:39.978
so you can get to
know these guys,

33:40.020 --> 33:42.188
but, pretty much, you're
gonna have two hours each

33:42.230 --> 33:44.315
with Leonard, Tristan, and Paul.

33:45.233 --> 33:46.943
- Okay, three dates in one day?

33:46.985 --> 33:48.028
- [Boom] Mhm.

33:48.069 --> 33:48.945
- Is that normal?

33:48.987 --> 33:50.613
- Nope, but neither is

33:50.655 --> 33:53.491
having a tech company
anxiously awaiting the results.

33:54.492 --> 33:57.746
- [Father] Yeah,
try that one. Great.

33:57.787 --> 33:59.497
- [Vivi] Thinking
of taking a dip?

34:01.082 --> 34:05.503
- No. it just reminds me of
this time when I was a kid.

34:07.088 --> 34:08.590
I got it in my head

34:08.631 --> 34:11.468
that fishing was the ultimate
father and son activity,

34:11.509 --> 34:14.804
so I bugged my dad until
he finally took me.

34:14.846 --> 34:17.098
Now, keep in mind he
was from a city in India

34:17.140 --> 34:19.809
that was nowhere near the ocean.

34:19.851 --> 34:21.936
(Vivi chuckles)

34:21.978 --> 34:23.480
But my dad and I,

34:23.521 --> 34:26.066
we were on this tiny boat
on the water for hours

34:26.107 --> 34:28.943
before we realized that we
were terrible at fishing.

34:28.985 --> 34:30.236
(Vivi and Boom chuckle)

34:30.278 --> 34:31.863
But he must have seen it coming,

34:31.905 --> 34:34.574
because he brought a deck of
cards and we played Go Fish

34:34.616 --> 34:36.284
right there on the boat instead.

34:38.078 --> 34:40.163
It's the only way
I caught something.

34:42.624 --> 34:44.417
- You had a really special dad.

34:46.336 --> 34:49.589
- Yeah. You two
would've gotten along.

34:49.631 --> 34:52.300
(gentle music)

34:54.928 --> 34:56.221
- Race you back.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.514
- [Boom] Whoa, okay.

34:57.555 --> 34:58.556
(Boom laughs)

34:58.598 --> 34:59.599
- Let's go!

34:59.641 --> 35:00.558
- [Boom] I'm so gonna win this!

35:00.600 --> 35:01.434
- [Vivi] No, you are not!

35:01.476 --> 35:03.436
- [Boom] We got a long run back!

35:03.478 --> 35:06.439
- Ultimately, the
best relationship
would create harmony

35:06.481 --> 35:10.777
for me, my partner, and
the people in our lives.

35:10.819 --> 35:13.988
- Uh, oh. This isn't
the restaurant.

35:14.030 --> 35:15.323
- [Walter] It looks
like a medical building.

35:15.365 --> 35:17.701
- Our reservations
are in an hour.

35:17.742 --> 35:21.788
In the meantime, I booked you
guys for marriage counseling.

35:23.039 --> 35:24.207
- You tricked us.

35:24.249 --> 35:25.625
- Where did you
learn this behavior?

35:25.667 --> 35:28.336
- Dad, Mom, I want you to have

35:28.378 --> 35:31.256
a great relationship the
same way I'm going to.

35:31.297 --> 35:34.884
Don't you deserve that? We
could be one big happy family.

35:34.926 --> 35:35.885
- [Jen] Sure, but-

35:35.927 --> 35:38.013
- And I prepaid for 10 sessions.

35:38.054 --> 35:38.888
- 10?

35:38.930 --> 35:39.889
- [Walter] Oh.

35:39.931 --> 35:42.058
- You know what therapists cost?

35:42.100 --> 35:44.394
Money doesn't grow on trees.

35:44.436 --> 35:46.521
- I'm appalled you'd
use my line against me.

35:46.563 --> 35:47.397
(Vivi chuckles)

35:47.439 --> 35:48.398
(crowd applauds)

35:48.440 --> 35:49.524
- All right.

35:49.566 --> 35:52.902
Next up, we have,
ah, Vivi, Nila!

35:52.944 --> 35:54.070
Tell me how that trial's going

35:54.112 --> 35:56.156
with Raina Kumar modifications.

35:56.197 --> 35:57.741
Tell me. Tell me.

35:57.782 --> 36:01.369
- Well, for users engaging
with the new criteria,

36:01.411 --> 36:06.458
the success rate is up
to 31% and climbing.

36:07.042 --> 36:08.835
- Ooh, 31%.

36:08.877 --> 36:11.796
Now, can anybody give me a
dollar figure to that, please?

36:12.714 --> 36:14.507
(gentle music)

36:14.549 --> 36:15.467
Thank you.

36:20.722 --> 36:25.810
Double digit millions in
increased revenue already.

36:26.519 --> 36:27.354
Very nice!

36:27.395 --> 36:30.023
Woo!
(crowd applauding)

36:30.065 --> 36:32.942
- I am so happy
you feel that way,

36:32.984 --> 36:35.111
because I have some more ideas

36:35.153 --> 36:38.281
to make Data Mate a
little more personal.

36:38.323 --> 36:42.702
Maybe face-to-face coaching
or in-person intros.

36:42.744 --> 36:44.371
- Hey, okay, so now,

36:44.412 --> 36:48.333
do you know why dating
apps are so popular, huh?

36:48.375 --> 36:53.004
Because people wanna meet
people without meeting people.

36:53.046 --> 36:54.506
Hm? Am I right?

36:54.547 --> 36:55.965
- [Audience Member]
That's true, yeah.

36:56.007 --> 36:57.425
- What about some
different prompts?

36:58.593 --> 37:01.096
Maybe "what is your
parents' relationship like?"

37:01.137 --> 37:02.430
- Ooh.

37:02.472 --> 37:03.640
- Based on what
we've done so far,

37:03.682 --> 37:05.892
that should increase
user engagement.

37:06.935 --> 37:09.521
- Which our
advertisers will love!

37:10.438 --> 37:13.817
Yes!
(crowd applauding)

37:14.859 --> 37:17.237
- It's cute and classy.

37:17.278 --> 37:19.864
- What about fun and sexy?

37:19.906 --> 37:21.658
- Those are nice goals.

37:21.700 --> 37:23.159
- It has to be comfy if
I'm gonna make it through

37:23.201 --> 37:24.869
all three of these second dates.

37:24.911 --> 37:26.538
(doorbell rings)

37:26.579 --> 37:28.415
That's Boom. I have
to get changed.

37:28.456 --> 37:30.750
- Oh, someone just
got adorably anxious.

37:30.792 --> 37:32.335
- Lies!

37:33.920 --> 37:35.839
- Hey, Nila. Vivi ready?

37:35.880 --> 37:37.507
- Finishing touches.

37:37.549 --> 37:39.384
- Vivi, we're on
a tight schedule!

37:39.426 --> 37:42.470
Plus I just double-parked
out outside. We gotta go.

37:42.512 --> 37:47.726
(door creaks)
(upbeat music)

37:48.727 --> 37:50.228
- How do I look?

37:50.895 --> 37:51.855
- Late.

37:54.566 --> 37:55.525
- Go. Have fun.

37:55.567 --> 37:56.568
I'll lock up,

37:58.570 --> 38:01.031
after I've binged all your
streaming subscriptions.

38:01.072 --> 38:02.782
- Nila!

38:02.824 --> 38:04.909
Okay. Are you ready?

38:04.951 --> 38:07.620
(lively music)

38:13.710 --> 38:14.919
(Vivi squeals)

38:14.961 --> 38:17.714
(Vivi chuckles)

38:23.762 --> 38:25.722
Excuse me, sir.

38:26.723 --> 38:27.682
May I help you?

38:27.724 --> 38:28.933
- No. Thank you.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.229
(Vivi groans)

38:33.271 --> 38:37.067
(boyfriend chuckles)

38:37.108 --> 38:39.694
- Excuse me just a sec. Just...

38:39.736 --> 38:44.783
(crowd chattering)
(games beeping)

38:49.871 --> 38:52.999
(crowd continues chattering)

38:53.041 --> 38:54.084
- Hi.
(Nila chuckles)

38:54.125 --> 38:54.876
- [Nila] Hi.

38:54.918 --> 38:55.835
- How are you?

38:55.877 --> 38:58.088
- Good. Okay, don't be mad.

38:58.129 --> 39:00.507
See, back in the day in India,

39:00.548 --> 39:02.258
potential couples would have

39:02.300 --> 39:05.345
group excursions or
chaperoned outings.

39:05.387 --> 39:08.598
- Wait. Raina put
you up to this?

39:08.640 --> 39:11.393
Does she not think that
I'm responsible a adult?

39:11.434 --> 39:13.019
- Oh, no, this isn't about that.

39:13.061 --> 39:14.521
This is about

39:14.562 --> 39:16.981
other people's interpretations
of your relationship.

39:17.023 --> 39:18.650
See, 'cause when you're in it,

39:18.692 --> 39:21.945
you can be blinded
by attraction,

39:21.986 --> 39:23.405
but people on the outside

39:23.446 --> 39:25.615
might be able to see
the bigger picture.

39:25.657 --> 39:28.618
On the plus side,
so far, so good.

39:28.660 --> 39:31.705
(Nila chuckles)

39:31.746 --> 39:33.873
- This is our little
fluffy Bubbles.

39:33.915 --> 39:35.500
- Oh!

39:35.542 --> 39:37.377
When did you rescue her?

39:37.419 --> 39:39.838
- About five years ago. My
friend couldn't keep her.

39:39.879 --> 39:41.673
She comes from a
line of show dogs.

39:41.715 --> 39:44.175
Fit right in with
the whole family.

39:44.217 --> 39:46.594
- My folks could
never handle a dog.

39:46.636 --> 39:49.139
- They've got
enough to deal with.

39:49.180 --> 39:50.140
- Meaning?

39:50.181 --> 39:51.766
- Oh, just that they're lucky

39:51.808 --> 39:54.978
you turned out as well as you
did, given their tendencies.

39:55.937 --> 39:58.314
- Wow. So much for your manners.

39:58.356 --> 40:00.650
I mean, how can you think
so little of my folks?

40:00.692 --> 40:01.901
They raised me.

40:01.943 --> 40:04.029
- Was what I saw an exception?

40:04.070 --> 40:05.488
My mom and dad taught me

40:05.530 --> 40:08.283
what you project to the outside
world comes back to you.

40:08.324 --> 40:11.536
That's why being,
well, socially refined

40:11.578 --> 40:14.039
is good for our image
and is good for us.

40:15.707 --> 40:18.793
- Yeah. Some people
don't care about image.

40:18.835 --> 40:19.711
- I noticed.

40:22.505 --> 40:24.174
- Thanks for your time, Paul.

40:24.215 --> 40:26.760
It was nice getting to know you.

40:26.801 --> 40:28.303
- I'm sure it was.

40:28.345 --> 40:33.433
(classical music)
(crowd chattering)

40:38.355 --> 40:41.941
(classical music continues)

40:41.983 --> 40:43.401
- You're Raina's last spy?

40:44.944 --> 40:46.738
- I prefer caring observer.

40:47.989 --> 40:50.450
I'm sorry. That was rough.

40:50.492 --> 40:52.827
- You know, I thought that
I had accepted my parents,

40:52.869 --> 40:55.705
but, somehow, Paul
struck a nerve.

40:55.747 --> 40:56.748
- Hm.

40:57.999 --> 41:00.377
Well, if you organize
and store your emotions

41:00.418 --> 41:01.961
like you do your belongings,

41:02.003 --> 41:04.964
maybe you buried how
you feel so far down

41:05.006 --> 41:06.091
that you can't find it.

41:06.132 --> 41:07.676
Could even be from years ago.

41:08.843 --> 41:10.178
- Like childhood?

41:10.220 --> 41:12.889
- Okay. You wanna
tell me about that?

41:12.931 --> 41:17.060
- I mean, I don't have many
fond childhood family memories

41:17.102 --> 41:18.561
like other people.

41:18.603 --> 41:20.522
Maybe that is in part
because of my folks,

41:20.563 --> 41:23.441
but I can't just write them off.

41:23.483 --> 41:26.528
- I respect that and
that's my culture too.

41:26.569 --> 41:28.530
We may not agree with
everything our parents do,

41:28.571 --> 41:30.865
but we still care for them.

41:30.907 --> 41:33.243
- Even when they
sometimes drive you crazy.

41:33.284 --> 41:34.285
- Only sometimes?

41:34.327 --> 41:36.079
(Boom laughs)

41:36.121 --> 41:37.122
You're doing great.

41:39.165 --> 41:41.418
- I need another pick-me-up.

41:41.459 --> 41:45.755
- Actually, I have
a better idea.

41:51.970 --> 41:56.266
(gentle music)
(crowd chattering)

41:56.307 --> 41:58.977
- Vivi, welcome to Priya
and Amit's engagement.

42:00.687 --> 42:02.731
- Bhumesh, you came.

42:04.441 --> 42:06.317
And with Vivi, no less.

42:07.402 --> 42:09.529
I take it your
concert was canceled?

42:09.571 --> 42:11.114
- Yeah, something like that.

42:12.991 --> 42:16.911
- Raina, you probably wanna
hear how my dates went.

42:16.953 --> 42:19.247
- Actually, I already know.

42:21.750 --> 42:25.045
(Raina chuckles)

42:25.086 --> 42:26.379
Oh, what's this for?

42:27.881 --> 42:29.549
- For caring.

42:29.591 --> 42:31.009
You really put into focus

42:31.051 --> 42:34.429
how Data Mate sorely
lacks a human touch.

42:34.471 --> 42:36.973
- Oh, Vivi, I'm
only human touch.

42:37.015 --> 42:37.932
(Vivi chuckles)

42:37.974 --> 42:39.059
Go. Sit.

42:40.101 --> 42:41.519
- [Boom] Vivi, shall we?

42:44.856 --> 42:45.982
Here. Let me.

42:46.024 --> 42:47.192
- Oh, thanks.

42:48.568 --> 42:49.527
Hi. Hi.

42:50.862 --> 42:52.614
Hi.
- Hi.

42:54.032 --> 42:56.159
- So, what do the
lamps symbolize?

42:56.201 --> 43:00.121
- Oh, so much. Dispelling
evil with good.

43:00.163 --> 43:02.248
Spreading joy and prosperity.

43:02.290 --> 43:05.418
Burning off our worst
impulses with our best selves.

43:05.460 --> 43:07.837
We light lamps for almost
all Hindu ceremonies.

43:07.879 --> 43:10.590
- Hm. I love that.

43:10.632 --> 43:12.217
What's your favorite meaning?

43:14.135 --> 43:15.595
- It's actually when

43:15.637 --> 43:19.140
lighting lamps is wisdom
overcoming our ignorance.

43:20.433 --> 43:21.267
- So, you need all the lamps.
- Not enough lamps for you?

43:23.144 --> 43:26.398
(Vivi and Boom laugh)

43:28.525 --> 43:31.319
(peaceful music)

43:34.572 --> 43:36.616
Yeah, surprisingly, Priya
and Amit's engagement

43:36.658 --> 43:38.618
was super easy to put together.

43:38.660 --> 43:40.578
- You did not put this
whole thing together.

43:40.620 --> 43:42.622
- I mean, we had
a big hand in it.

43:42.664 --> 43:45.041
- Yeah. Oh, thank you.

43:45.083 --> 43:46.876
- Thank you so much.

43:46.918 --> 43:49.713
This is jalebi. It's
an Indian sweet.

43:49.754 --> 43:51.631
- Sounds excellent.

43:51.673 --> 43:52.882
I can use my fingers?

43:52.924 --> 43:54.592
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:59.639 --> 44:00.640
- Mm.

44:00.682 --> 44:01.558
- It's so good. It's so good.

44:01.599 --> 44:03.226
- So sweet.

44:03.268 --> 44:06.104
- This is the bride's
mom doing the Aarti,

44:06.146 --> 44:07.731
kind of like an opening prayer.

44:10.108 --> 44:11.776
- It's so beautiful.

44:13.153 --> 44:15.905
- This is a tradition
in some parts of India.

44:15.947 --> 44:17.657
It's called the Roka.

44:17.699 --> 44:19.576
It's related to the word "stop,"

44:19.617 --> 44:22.787
because the bride and groom
don't need to keep looking.

44:22.829 --> 44:24.539
They found each other.

44:24.581 --> 44:27.208
(lively music)

44:30.420 --> 44:31.296
- Roka.

44:33.131 --> 44:35.425
- [Boom] And now
relatives give gifts

44:35.467 --> 44:37.594
to welcome the bride and
groom into their family,

44:37.635 --> 44:39.596
because, like we
talked about before,

44:39.637 --> 44:41.931
a marriage isn't just
between two people.

44:41.973 --> 44:42.932
- It's the whole family.

44:42.974 --> 44:43.892
- Mhm.

44:46.227 --> 44:49.439
This is the formal
engagement, the Sagai.

44:49.481 --> 44:52.233
(bright music)

44:53.985 --> 44:55.612
- It's so special.

44:55.653 --> 44:58.281
(bright music)

45:05.288 --> 45:07.540
(bright music continues)

45:07.582 --> 45:10.502
(crowd applauding)

45:15.924 --> 45:17.217
(gentle music)

45:17.258 --> 45:19.260
What are you doing?

45:19.302 --> 45:21.596
- [Boom] I know those people.

45:21.638 --> 45:22.806
- In a bad way?

45:22.847 --> 45:25.809
- Nope. Just haven't
spoken to them in years.

45:25.850 --> 45:28.144
- Okay, I'm guessing you
haven't been to community events

45:28.186 --> 45:29.604
since your dad died,

45:29.646 --> 45:31.981
because, ultimately,
they're about family,

45:32.023 --> 45:35.694
so you let go of these other
relationships along the way.

45:36.820 --> 45:37.862
- They're bringing
out dinner. Let's go.

45:37.904 --> 45:39.572
- Okay. Hold on.

45:41.116 --> 45:45.245
You're Mr. Spontaneous,
which is great and fun,

45:46.830 --> 45:49.249
but you ever think you might
be using that spontaneity

45:49.290 --> 45:52.836
to avoid dealing with what
is right in front of you?

45:52.877 --> 45:54.129
- Just to be clear,

45:54.170 --> 45:56.756
we're talking about
my human connections?

45:56.798 --> 45:58.216
- Light one lamp for wisdom.

45:59.342 --> 46:00.760
I mean, these were
good friendships,

46:00.802 --> 46:02.595
and it's worth fixing things.

46:03.596 --> 46:05.390
Great connections
are hard to find.

46:07.809 --> 46:10.645
Come on.
(gentle music)

46:10.687 --> 46:12.355
- Bhumesh Uncle!

46:12.397 --> 46:15.400
- Jaya, wow, you've
gotten so big.

46:16.985 --> 46:19.738
- Boom, where have
you been, man?

46:20.739 --> 46:21.781
- Vicky.
- Come on.

46:21.823 --> 46:22.657
- It's good to see you, man.

46:22.699 --> 46:24.909
- Come on.
- Really good.

46:24.951 --> 46:27.579
(gentle music)

46:34.002 --> 46:37.047
(Vivi chuckles)

46:37.088 --> 46:38.256
In case you get cold.

46:39.090 --> 46:40.925
- Where did you get this?

46:40.967 --> 46:42.635
- Oh, I bought it off an auntie.

46:43.345 --> 46:44.888
- So you stole it?

46:44.929 --> 46:46.348
- I might have stolen it.

46:46.389 --> 46:47.807
(Vivi and Boom laugh)

46:47.849 --> 46:48.683
(exciting music)

46:48.725 --> 46:50.810
They might be coming after us.

46:50.852 --> 46:52.354
Oh, man. Here comes the party.

46:53.355 --> 46:54.773
- All right, Boom.

46:54.814 --> 46:55.899
You're about to see a
whole 'nother side of me.

46:55.940 --> 46:57.233
- [Boom] Oh, okay.

46:57.275 --> 47:01.905
(vocalist singing
in foreign language)

47:07.535 --> 47:12.624
(vocalist continues singing
in foreign language)

47:17.629 --> 47:22.634
(exciting music continues)
(crowd cheering)

47:24.135 --> 47:28.682
(vocalist singing
in foreign language)

47:31.893 --> 47:32.727
(Boom chuckles)

47:32.769 --> 47:33.603
- How's it going, man?

47:33.645 --> 47:34.437
- Good, man.

47:34.479 --> 47:35.939
- Yeah?

47:35.980 --> 47:38.274
Dude, you and Raina should
take a bow for this engagement.

47:38.316 --> 47:40.527
- Oh, thank you. Nah,
this is just what we do.

47:40.568 --> 47:41.778
- Sure, but you've helped make

47:41.820 --> 47:43.988
so many other people's
weddings happen.

47:44.030 --> 47:45.240
What's it gonna take for yours?

47:45.281 --> 47:46.950
- Ha. The right woman.

47:46.991 --> 47:48.535
- The right woman?

47:48.576 --> 47:51.579
Oh, maybe now you try telling
me about this special lady.

47:53.331 --> 47:56.084
- Well, she'd have
such a generous heart

47:57.252 --> 47:58.878
and she'd find a
way to take care of

47:58.920 --> 48:00.422
all the people in her life,

48:01.965 --> 48:05.885
and she'd be driven and
knows how to take control.

48:05.927 --> 48:08.596
(tender music)

48:09.848 --> 48:11.808
But she'd also be
fun and open-minded,

48:12.851 --> 48:15.562
and I'd be thinking
about her all the time,

48:15.603 --> 48:18.606
and not just because
of how she looks,

48:18.648 --> 48:21.109
but because of how she
thinks and who she is.

48:27.198 --> 48:30.493
- I see you know
exactly what you want.

48:31.786 --> 48:33.163
Hope you find her.

48:33.204 --> 48:34.164
- Yeah.

48:34.205 --> 48:35.040
(crowd applauding)

48:35.081 --> 48:37.208
- Thank you. That was lovely.

48:37.250 --> 48:42.422
(Vivi giggles)
(tender music)

48:45.800 --> 48:46.801
- You were amazing.

48:46.843 --> 48:50.722
- That was exactly
what I needed.

48:52.015 --> 48:56.186
- Me too. Thanks for being
a part of me reconnecting.

48:56.227 --> 48:57.687
This makes me wanna do more,

48:57.729 --> 49:00.440
maybe even go back to India
to go see my family there.

49:00.482 --> 49:04.527
- Boom, why did you
decide to bring me here?

49:06.571 --> 49:09.616
- I don't know,
but I'm glad I did.

49:09.657 --> 49:11.743
This is the most
relaxed I've seen you.

49:13.036 --> 49:16.873
- This is the most comfortable
I have felt in a long time

49:19.125 --> 49:20.585
with anyone.

49:21.961 --> 49:22.921
- Uh, so,

49:24.422 --> 49:27.759
you're choosing between
Leonard and Tristan, right?

49:28.885 --> 49:29.594
- Uh.

49:29.636 --> 49:31.388
(Vivi clears throat)

49:31.429 --> 49:32.931
- Yeah, Leonard and Tristan.

49:35.141 --> 49:36.267
You know, it's getting late.

49:36.309 --> 49:39.562
You stay here with
Raina. I'll call a ride.

49:41.106 --> 49:42.023
Goodnight.

49:42.065 --> 49:43.066
- Goodnight.

49:45.735 --> 49:46.611
- Okay.

49:47.862 --> 49:49.197
- Have a good one.

49:49.239 --> 49:50.407
(Raina speaks in
foreign language)

49:50.448 --> 49:51.950
- What's going on with Vivi?

49:53.284 --> 49:56.287
- Mom, she's a client.

49:56.329 --> 49:58.665
I'm just doing my job.
(lively music)

49:58.707 --> 50:03.503
(vocalist singing
in foreign language)

50:06.965 --> 50:09.259
- Um, are we the
new office it girls?

50:09.300 --> 50:09.926
- Um.

50:09.968 --> 50:11.886
- Hey, Vivi, Nila.

50:11.928 --> 50:13.847
We are about to have some
real talk up in C-suite.

50:13.888 --> 50:14.681
You wanna come with?

50:14.723 --> 50:16.141
Because, you,

50:16.182 --> 50:19.185
you're really showing people
what you're capable of.

50:19.227 --> 50:20.729
- Thank you.

50:20.770 --> 50:22.689
I am all about better
relationships and
better matches.

50:22.731 --> 50:24.107
- And better results.

50:24.149 --> 50:26.401
We're on track for
our best quarter yet.

50:26.443 --> 50:28.361
You keep this up,

50:28.403 --> 50:30.530
you're in line for
some pretty big things.

50:30.572 --> 50:31.531
Let's go!

50:32.866 --> 50:35.535
(Vivi and Nila squeal)

50:35.577 --> 50:36.536
- [Vivi] Hi, Daddy.

50:36.578 --> 50:37.454
- [Walter] Heya, turtle.

50:37.495 --> 50:38.872
I don't mean to bother you

50:38.913 --> 50:39.831
before your big dates
with Leonard and Tristan.

50:39.873 --> 50:41.291
- That's okay. What's up?

50:41.332 --> 50:43.293
- [Walter] Come
around out front.

50:43.335 --> 50:44.169
- Okay.

50:47.213 --> 50:48.173
(Jen sighs)

50:48.214 --> 50:48.840
Hi.

50:48.882 --> 50:50.884
- Hi!

50:50.925 --> 50:52.719
- Are you cleaning my room out?

50:52.761 --> 50:54.220
- Yeah, we have to,

50:54.262 --> 50:57.098
because we're turning it
into our home fitness center.

50:57.140 --> 50:57.974
Isn't that right, honey?

50:58.016 --> 50:59.225
- Absolutely, love.

50:59.267 --> 51:00.518
What a wonderful
idea on your part.

51:00.560 --> 51:02.854
My heart thanks you
in more ways than one.

51:02.896 --> 51:05.398
- Why are you guys
talking like that?

51:05.440 --> 51:07.734
- Oh, well, our marriage
counselor suggested

51:07.776 --> 51:09.152
changing the tone of our words

51:09.194 --> 51:11.029
to change the tone
of our relationship.

51:11.071 --> 51:12.447
- We thought we'd keep
the momentum going

51:12.489 --> 51:13.907
by exercising together.

51:13.948 --> 51:15.241
Burn cals. Stay pals.

51:15.283 --> 51:16.910
(Jen chuckles)

51:16.951 --> 51:18.495
- Aw. That makes me so happy.

51:18.536 --> 51:20.205
- Aw, honey, it's working.

51:20.997 --> 51:21.915
Hey, Boom!

51:21.956 --> 51:24.250
- Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Daniels.

51:24.292 --> 51:25.168
- Hi.

51:26.044 --> 51:27.629
- You ready for your dates?

51:28.922 --> 51:32.550
- Yeah. Just have to
put these boxes inside.

51:32.592 --> 51:34.094
- Oh, please.

51:34.135 --> 51:35.512
Let me.

51:35.553 --> 51:37.472
(Boom chuckles)

51:37.514 --> 51:38.765
- Go ahead and laugh.

51:38.807 --> 51:39.891
- No, not at all.

51:39.933 --> 51:41.184
I bet my mom still has

51:41.226 --> 51:43.603
my vintage Ninja
Turtle action figures

51:43.645 --> 51:44.729
in a drawer somewhere.

51:48.066 --> 51:51.027
You know, it's not really about
the stuffed animal or toy.

51:51.069 --> 51:53.446
It's more about the phase
in your life they represent,

51:53.488 --> 51:57.492
the innocence before you realize
how fragile it all can be.

51:58.451 --> 51:59.828
- Oh, your first kiss.

51:59.869 --> 52:01.287
- There was no kiss!
- What are you talking about?

52:01.329 --> 52:04.124
- Oh, I swear I saw you
smooch this little guy

52:04.165 --> 52:05.375
when you were like
five years old.

52:05.417 --> 52:07.085
It was so adorable.

52:07.127 --> 52:08.628
- [Walter] Boom, you know
what Vivi used to call him?

52:08.670 --> 52:09.796
- Uh-uh.

52:09.838 --> 52:11.047
- Bear E. White.

52:11.089 --> 52:13.091
(Vivi's parents laugh)

52:13.133 --> 52:14.718
She loved his music as a baby.

52:15.677 --> 52:17.178
Hey, Jen.

52:17.220 --> 52:18.638
Maybe you and I should listen
to some of Barry's songs

52:18.680 --> 52:20.306
like we used to.
- Ooh!

52:20.348 --> 52:22.934
- Okay, you know, I never
thought I would say this,

52:22.976 --> 52:25.687
but can you just chill
it on the wooing?

52:25.729 --> 52:27.230
- Oh.
- Oh, well, our counselor

52:27.272 --> 52:29.024
told us to live our truth, so.

52:29.065 --> 52:30.817
- This is what you
paid for, Vivi,

52:30.859 --> 52:33.945
and money doesn't
grow on trees, right?

52:33.987 --> 52:35.405
- Oh, burn.

52:35.447 --> 52:38.283
- How did I know that was
gonna come back to me?

52:39.617 --> 52:40.702
- Hello, Vivi.

52:40.744 --> 52:41.995
- Hi.

52:42.037 --> 52:44.164
- Meet Arin. He's
a Vedic astrologer.

52:44.205 --> 52:46.416
- Oh. I love reading
my horoscope.

52:46.458 --> 52:48.501
- Ah, but Vedic
astrology is different.

52:48.543 --> 52:51.171
It takes into account that
Earth's orbit wobbles.

52:51.212 --> 52:52.297
- Oh.

52:52.339 --> 52:53.214
- Indians have
long believed that

52:53.256 --> 52:55.717
the stars reveal your karma,

52:55.759 --> 52:57.260
what you carry from a past life,

52:57.302 --> 53:00.430
your guna, moral
character, and more,

53:00.472 --> 53:03.141
all indicated by your
date and time of birth,

53:03.183 --> 53:05.518
day of the week, even
your exact birth location.

53:05.560 --> 53:09.105
- I know what you're thinking.
All this stuff is mystical.

53:09.147 --> 53:11.524
- Well, all those
facts about my birth

53:11.566 --> 53:14.944
are information similar
to how Data Mate requests

53:14.986 --> 53:16.863
basic information
about its users.

53:16.905 --> 53:18.198
- The astrological
paths of two people

53:18.239 --> 53:21.993
can indicate
misalignment or harmony.

53:22.035 --> 53:23.536
- Similar to how
Data Mate's algorithm

53:23.578 --> 53:25.789
seeks compatibilities
to find matches.

53:25.830 --> 53:28.541
- By the way, Mom, this kind
of comparison is exactly

53:28.583 --> 53:31.753
how we should explain astrology
if we're gonna modernize.

53:31.795 --> 53:33.338
- Bring in the first bachelor.

53:34.381 --> 53:36.800
- Wait. My dates
are happening here?

53:36.841 --> 53:38.259
- Of course.

53:38.301 --> 53:40.720
You're getting your
astrological readings together.

53:40.762 --> 53:42.138
- Vivi and Leonard,

53:42.180 --> 53:44.057
you'll have several
interpersonal obstacles

53:44.099 --> 53:45.725
to overcome in
your relationship.

53:47.185 --> 53:49.062
- I think I need to
see your credentials.

53:49.104 --> 53:52.190
- Listen, I know that
analytics and numbers

53:52.232 --> 53:54.067
feel much more certain,

53:54.109 --> 53:57.195
but I have tried the
scientific ways of dating.

53:57.237 --> 53:59.072
Maybe there is more
to think about.

53:59.114 --> 54:01.199
Besides, an astrologer
brought us together

54:01.241 --> 54:02.701
for this date, right?

54:02.742 --> 54:04.994
- You two will disagree far
more than you will agree.

54:05.036 --> 54:07.914
- What? No, I need
a better answer.

54:07.956 --> 54:09.499
- Leonard!

54:09.541 --> 54:11.710
Relationships aren't
like calculus.

54:11.751 --> 54:15.672
You cannot just have exact
inputs and solve for X.

54:15.714 --> 54:18.133
- I think you mean algebra.

54:18.174 --> 54:21.052
- Okay. That metaphor
did nothing for you.

54:21.094 --> 54:24.055
Can you just keep an
open mind, please?

54:24.097 --> 54:26.307
- I don't think this
is working, Vivi.

54:27.559 --> 54:30.103
- Vivi and Tristan, a
relationship would be calm

54:30.145 --> 54:32.355
with few disturbances,
low or high.

54:32.397 --> 54:34.441
- Well, that's nice, right?

54:34.482 --> 54:37.527
- Better than nice. I love
astrology and the stars.

54:37.569 --> 54:39.779
Reminds me of camping and
staring up at the sky.

54:39.821 --> 54:41.072
- You camp?

54:41.114 --> 54:42.282
- Oh, yeah, being out
in the wilderness,

54:42.323 --> 54:44.659
middle of nowhere, no
comforts, co phone.

54:45.535 --> 54:46.369
- No phone?

54:47.704 --> 54:48.788
That sounds bold.

54:50.248 --> 54:52.208
- One day, I plan to move
totally off the grid,

54:52.250 --> 54:54.336
just me and my partner.

54:54.377 --> 54:57.797
- I think Vivi's more of a
city, arts and culture type.

54:59.507 --> 55:01.968
- But for someone who
wants to be my partner,

55:02.010 --> 55:04.721
I am willing to be open.

55:04.763 --> 55:08.558
- This makes me happy.
You are growing, Vivi.

55:08.600 --> 55:09.893
You make me proud.

55:09.934 --> 55:11.478
Thank you, Arin.

55:11.519 --> 55:14.189
(gentle music)

55:16.608 --> 55:18.818
- Born October '92.

55:18.860 --> 55:20.111
Oh, no.

55:20.153 --> 55:20.987
Raina?

55:21.029 --> 55:21.946
- Hm?

55:28.328 --> 55:30.246
- Mom, what are you doing?

55:30.288 --> 55:31.706
- He's just asking.

55:32.665 --> 55:35.919
(Ervin softly chuckles)

55:48.890 --> 55:51.184
- Boom, what did he say?

55:51.226 --> 55:54.312
- That Tristan is
the match for you.

55:54.354 --> 55:57.482
- Well, in that case, Vivi, can
I take you out this weekend?

56:02.570 --> 56:03.863
- Great idea.

56:03.905 --> 56:05.323
- [Tristan] Great.

56:05.365 --> 56:07.033
- Great, and I hear the
weather's gonna be amazing too.

56:07.075 --> 56:08.201
- Oh, yeah.

56:08.243 --> 56:09.703
- To go for a
workout in the park.

56:09.744 --> 56:12.914
With these giant, large
muscles and your deep voice,

56:12.956 --> 56:14.499
I'm sure you'll like that.

56:14.541 --> 56:16.334
- Everyone is getting
what they want.

56:16.376 --> 56:17.502
- Yeah. They sure are.

56:17.544 --> 56:21.840
- So, yes, this
weekend sounds great.

56:21.881 --> 56:24.509
(lively music)

56:25.844 --> 56:28.096
- You're a little too nervous

56:28.138 --> 56:31.474
for someone going on a date
with her potential Mr. Right.

56:32.767 --> 56:35.645
- Maybe it's because he
seems so good for me, Nila.

56:36.479 --> 56:38.440
- How's the vibe with him?

56:38.481 --> 56:40.525
- Well, first, I thought

56:40.567 --> 56:42.193
he was a little too
cool for school,

56:42.235 --> 56:44.237
but we've gotten closer.

56:44.279 --> 56:48.408
He's actually really
caring and fun.

56:48.450 --> 56:51.077
He's quick witted, but
he can take a joke too.

56:51.119 --> 56:52.412
A successful entrepreneur,

56:52.454 --> 56:54.539
has a great relationship
with his mom,

56:55.790 --> 56:59.419
and when I'm with him,
he understands me.

56:59.461 --> 57:01.880
He makes me easygoing
when I'm rigid,

57:01.921 --> 57:05.008
and I think I help him to
be more open and sincere,

57:05.050 --> 57:08.094
and I swear he really
cares about me,

57:08.136 --> 57:11.514
but then he just pulls away.

57:12.807 --> 57:15.352
It's like the universe is
telling us this won't work.

57:15.393 --> 57:19.981
- Hun, I was asking
about Tristan, not Boom.

57:20.857 --> 57:22.609
- Oh.

57:22.650 --> 57:23.526
Yeah, right.

57:24.903 --> 57:28.114
Who, okay, in terms of
everything, is a great fit.

57:28.156 --> 57:31.826
He is sweet, smart,
caring, and attractive.

57:31.868 --> 57:33.119
- Oh, yeah.

57:33.161 --> 57:35.580
- Oh, yeah. On paper,
it is all there.

57:35.622 --> 57:38.833
I mean, this process is
fixing Data Mate, right?

57:38.875 --> 57:43.129
- Yes, but no matter how
great our inputs are,

57:43.171 --> 57:46.883
there's one variable
we can't control,

57:46.925 --> 57:50.845
whether users answer our
questions truthfully.

57:50.887 --> 57:53.139
You know, if you're not
being honest with Raina

57:53.181 --> 57:58.478
about what you want or feel,
nothing she's doing will work.

57:58.978 --> 57:59.813
So, are you?

58:02.691 --> 58:03.608
(phone ringing)

58:03.650 --> 58:04.484
- Oh.

58:07.028 --> 58:07.862
Hey, guys.

58:07.904 --> 58:10.156
Wow. You look snazzy.

58:10.198 --> 58:11.658
- Oh, thank you, baby.

58:11.700 --> 58:13.827
We're just heading out for
our anniversary dinner.

58:13.868 --> 58:16.204
- The first time we've made
a night of it in years.

58:16.246 --> 58:17.914
- I'm so glad
you're celebrating.

58:17.956 --> 58:19.082
- We won't be home 'til late,

58:19.124 --> 58:20.291
so let's get together
for breakfast

58:20.333 --> 58:21.584
an hour later than planned.

58:21.626 --> 58:23.044
- Have fun, you two. I love you.

58:23.086 --> 58:23.878
- [Walter] Bye.

58:25.588 --> 58:28.008
- Now, that's a good omen.

58:28.049 --> 58:29.551
- Maybe.

58:29.592 --> 58:32.012
- Come on. You are rooting
for me to be happy, right?

58:32.053 --> 58:34.681
- Of course. Vivi, that's
all I want for you.

58:34.723 --> 58:36.641
- Good. Then that
makes two of us.

58:37.892 --> 58:39.728
(Vivi chuckles)

58:42.564 --> 58:47.485
(gentle music)
(team shouting)

58:52.323 --> 58:54.492
(gentle music continues)

58:54.534 --> 58:55.493
- [Boom] Time out!

58:57.412 --> 58:58.580
- [Teammate] Dude.

58:58.621 --> 59:00.206
- What?
- What are you doing?

59:00.248 --> 59:01.916
- I thought I dropped
my keys back there.

59:01.958 --> 59:03.335
- Dude, I saw you and Vivi.

59:03.376 --> 59:05.295
Almost everyone here
has seen you two.

59:05.337 --> 59:06.838
- Vicky, it's not
what you think.

59:06.880 --> 59:08.673
- I'm on your side, okay?

59:08.715 --> 59:11.593
So let me remind you
of something Pratik
Uncle always said.

59:11.634 --> 59:14.637
A man's true friends point
out what he refuses to see.

59:15.972 --> 59:17.557
- Sounds like Dad.

59:17.599 --> 59:20.226
(gentle music)

59:21.311 --> 59:22.228
- [Vicky] Time in!

59:25.899 --> 59:26.858
- [Tristan] Nice and secure?

59:26.900 --> 59:28.151
- [Vivi] Mhm.

59:32.405 --> 59:34.491
- Don't worry. I'll
be right beside you.

59:34.532 --> 59:37.452
Just follow my lead and
we'll make it up together.

59:37.494 --> 59:38.411
- Okay.

59:39.746 --> 59:41.289
- You're not afraid
of heights, are you?

59:42.957 --> 59:44.542
- Not yet.

59:44.584 --> 59:46.419
(Tristan chuckles)

59:46.461 --> 59:47.712
- You'll be fine.

59:47.754 --> 59:50.423
(gentle music)

59:52.050 --> 59:53.843
- Just handholds and footholds.

59:53.885 --> 59:54.969
- Okay.

59:55.929 --> 59:58.181
Handholds and footholds.

59:59.265 --> 01:00:02.060
(Vivi grunting)

01:00:06.773 --> 01:00:08.733
Oh!
(Tristan chuckles)

01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:10.902
- We're having some
hiccups, aren't we?

01:00:10.944 --> 01:00:13.613
- Guess we're not
naturally in rhythm.

01:00:13.655 --> 01:00:15.532
- That's okay. We'll work on it.

01:00:18.034 --> 01:00:19.202
I love this place.

01:00:20.161 --> 01:00:22.038
It's my favorite
getaway from the city.

01:00:25.417 --> 01:00:26.292
- Oh.

01:00:29.212 --> 01:00:31.047
- I'm glad to be here with you.

01:00:39.472 --> 01:00:42.517
(playful music)

01:00:42.559 --> 01:00:43.643
(Tristan and Vivi chuckle)

01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:44.936
(phone dings)

01:00:44.978 --> 01:00:47.605
- Oh, sorry. One
second, Tristan.

01:00:47.647 --> 01:00:49.816
(message whooshes)

01:00:49.858 --> 01:00:52.610
(Vivi chuckles)

01:00:54.112 --> 01:00:57.323
I think that's a good moment
to close our date with.

01:00:58.575 --> 01:01:02.912
- Bummer, but I get it.
You are worth the wait.

01:01:02.954 --> 01:01:04.289
Besides, what's the rush

01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:06.166
if we might just
work out for good?

01:01:14.466 --> 01:01:16.343
- Okay, well...

01:01:17.969 --> 01:01:18.803
See ya.

01:01:18.845 --> 01:01:19.679
- [Tristan] Yeah.

01:01:23.558 --> 01:01:25.810
- Mom, Dad!

01:01:25.852 --> 01:01:27.228
I brought jalebi with me.

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:28.980
It's a kind of Indian sweet.

01:01:29.022 --> 01:01:30.148
- In here, baby.

01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:31.983
- I had another
date with Tristan.

01:01:32.025 --> 01:01:33.985
I think there could
be potential maybe,

01:01:34.027 --> 01:01:36.237
but I'm still thinking about...

01:01:38.448 --> 01:01:40.241
You look exhausted.
What's wrong?

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:45.163
- We were up all night talking.

01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:48.166
- About our relationship
and our lives.

01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:49.084
- Okay.

01:01:50.877 --> 01:01:53.463
- When you're young,
opposites attract,

01:01:53.505 --> 01:01:55.590
and physical attraction
makes up for so much,

01:01:55.632 --> 01:01:57.258
but it can't carry you through.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.178
- What are you getting at?

01:02:01.262 --> 01:02:05.141
- Sweetheart, for
our own happiness,

01:02:07.769 --> 01:02:10.146
we've decided to get divorced.

01:02:12.732 --> 01:02:13.692
- What?

01:02:15.485 --> 01:02:16.569
Why?

01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:19.739
You two have been
getting along so well.

01:02:19.781 --> 01:02:20.699
- I know, baby.

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.991
I know, and the counseling

01:02:22.033 --> 01:02:23.576
really helped us stop
with the yelling,

01:02:23.618 --> 01:02:27.414
which meant we could finally
hear each other and ourselves.

01:02:27.455 --> 01:02:30.250
- We know we can't
find what we need

01:02:30.291 --> 01:02:32.752
if we force ourselves
to stay together.

01:02:32.794 --> 01:02:34.004
- No, don't. Please, stay, stay.

01:02:34.045 --> 01:02:35.255
Let's just talk about it.

01:02:35.296 --> 01:02:36.881
- No. I cannot stomach
your reasons right now.

01:02:36.923 --> 01:02:37.966
You're just giving up?

01:02:38.008 --> 01:02:39.009
- Turtle.

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:40.427
- After all of these years,

01:02:40.468 --> 01:02:43.513
you are just giving up
and I am not okay with it!

01:02:43.555 --> 01:02:46.182
(solemn music)

01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:53.815
(Vivi sighs)

01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:56.443
(phone dings)

01:02:57.527 --> 01:03:00.363
(message whooshes)

01:03:05.201 --> 01:03:08.455
(keyboard clicking)

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:12.250
(message whooshes)

01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:18.506
(peaceful music)

01:03:18.548 --> 01:03:19.466
- Hey.

01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:21.384
- Hi.

01:03:21.426 --> 01:03:24.471
Oh, Tristan, you look great.

01:03:24.512 --> 01:03:27.599
- Think so? Because
these clothes don't
really fit my style.

01:03:28.516 --> 01:03:30.018
- Well, you've only had
them a couple weeks.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:33.521
Give them another month
and they'll grow on you.

01:03:33.563 --> 01:03:34.481
Besides,

01:03:36.858 --> 01:03:38.151
we coordinate.

01:03:39.235 --> 01:03:41.404
- I guess it does show
how unified we are.

01:03:42.739 --> 01:03:44.074
Hey, there's something

01:03:44.115 --> 01:03:46.159
I wanna tell you about
my work situation.

01:03:46.201 --> 01:03:47.827
- [Server] Right
this way, please.

01:03:51.998 --> 01:03:52.874
- Thank you.

01:03:54.751 --> 01:03:57.796
So, which movie should we see?

01:03:57.837 --> 01:04:00.090
- Oh, there's this
new action-thriller
set in the Rockies.

01:04:00.131 --> 01:04:01.299
It looks so cool.

01:04:02.175 --> 01:04:04.302
- Sure. That's an option.

01:04:07.514 --> 01:04:11.643
- But if we can appreciate
the finer things as a couple,

01:04:11.685 --> 01:04:13.728
then it shows that
we can work together

01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:15.438
no matter the conditions.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.441
So, how about we do
something with subtitles?

01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:20.318
- Aw.

01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:24.322
You really get it.

01:04:30.537 --> 01:04:31.621
- Vivi, wait.

01:04:31.663 --> 01:04:33.164
Before we go in,
there's something

01:04:33.206 --> 01:04:35.166
I wanted to talk to you
about all night, and I just-

01:04:35.208 --> 01:04:36.918
- I thought I heard you pull up.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.753
(Raina chuckles)

01:04:38.795 --> 01:04:40.296
You are overdue for a check-in.

01:04:40.338 --> 01:04:42.674
Come in. Tell me everything.

01:04:42.716 --> 01:04:45.135
- Actually, Raina, can you
give us a moment please?

01:04:45.176 --> 01:04:46.344
- Oh, take your time.

01:04:46.386 --> 01:04:48.763
- Tristan, she's
been expecting us.

01:04:48.805 --> 01:04:50.765
If we can't honor our
commitment as a unit,

01:04:50.807 --> 01:04:53.852
all of the research says we'll
be on a downward trajectory.

01:04:53.893 --> 01:04:54.728
- Vivi!

01:04:56.187 --> 01:04:57.897
What is going on?

01:04:57.939 --> 01:04:59.149
It's like you've forgotten

01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:01.151
all the progress
you've made with me.

01:05:01.192 --> 01:05:03.611
- Vivi, I got a job
offer out of state

01:05:03.653 --> 01:05:06.781
and I've been deciding whether
I'm gonna stay here or move.

01:05:06.823 --> 01:05:09.409
- Oh, congrats.

01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:12.412
Well, that's something
we'll have to discuss.

01:05:12.454 --> 01:05:15.040
- I wanted us to work
out. I really did.

01:05:15.081 --> 01:05:16.458
Our vibe's changed,

01:05:18.418 --> 01:05:21.254
so I think I'm
gonna take the job.

01:05:22.881 --> 01:05:23.882
Take care, Vivi.

01:05:25.592 --> 01:05:26.551
I'll walk back.

01:05:26.593 --> 01:05:29.179
(solemn music)

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:32.140
(Vivi softly sobs)

01:05:32.182 --> 01:05:33.892
- You said your
system would work.

01:05:35.435 --> 01:05:37.812
- Vivi, you know
it's not so simple.

01:05:37.854 --> 01:05:39.898
- Your methods failed me too.

01:05:39.939 --> 01:05:42.359
(Vivi sobs)

01:05:43.068 --> 01:05:44.069
- Oh, Vivi.

01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:46.780
(solemn music)

01:05:48.198 --> 01:05:50.575
(knocking on door)
(TV chattering)

01:05:50.617 --> 01:05:52.285
- One sec, Nila.

01:05:56.873 --> 01:05:57.916
- Hey, Vivi.

01:05:59.125 --> 01:06:00.418
- Hey.

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:02.253
- I saw you outside
of Mom's house.

01:06:02.295 --> 01:06:04.130
I just wanna make
sure you were okay.

01:06:04.172 --> 01:06:06.383
- Yeah. That's
what texts are for.

01:06:06.424 --> 01:06:07.676
- And when you don't respond,

01:06:07.717 --> 01:06:09.386
that's what knocking
on your door is for.

01:06:09.427 --> 01:06:11.513
- I'm confused. Why do you care?

01:06:11.554 --> 01:06:13.932
I mean, the matchmaking business
is on an upswing, right?

01:06:13.973 --> 01:06:16.393
So, you're all set.

01:06:17.644 --> 01:06:19.729
- That's not all
that matters to me.

01:06:19.771 --> 01:06:21.106
- Right.

01:06:21.147 --> 01:06:22.440
There's also your view on love,

01:06:22.482 --> 01:06:24.234
like you told me
when we first met.

01:06:24.275 --> 01:06:25.902
- Oh, Vivi, that-

01:06:25.944 --> 01:06:28.488
- No, I mean, I should have
had your POV the whole time.

01:06:29.155 --> 01:06:31.408
I chased love. I got burned.

01:06:31.449 --> 01:06:32.409
Does that make you happy?

01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:34.160
- No. Of course not.

01:06:34.202 --> 01:06:35.912
- Hey, you know
the funny thing is

01:06:36.746 --> 01:06:39.374
we had such
different approaches,

01:06:42.168 --> 01:06:43.837
but here I am, alone,

01:06:45.839 --> 01:06:46.840
just like you.

01:06:53.596 --> 01:06:56.182
- You deserve better, Vivi.

01:06:56.224 --> 01:06:58.977
(tender music)

01:07:06.818 --> 01:07:09.029
- Somehow, this feels
worse than with Kenny.

01:07:10.739 --> 01:07:12.282
At least I could say
it with his fault.

01:07:12.323 --> 01:07:13.700
Now who do I blame?

01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:18.621
- You're gonna be okay.

01:07:20.874 --> 01:07:21.708
- Will I?

01:07:23.877 --> 01:07:27.756
Or do I just need to accept
that I am not made for love?

01:07:29.924 --> 01:07:31.092
- Come on. Come on.

01:07:39.517 --> 01:07:41.019
- Oh, thanks for helping us.

01:07:42.270 --> 01:07:44.356
We know this is
hard for you too.

01:07:44.397 --> 01:07:46.024
- Of course. I'm here for you.

01:07:47.317 --> 01:07:50.612
- And we're really sorry about
how your romance ended up.

01:07:50.653 --> 01:07:52.489
- Well, I guess it
runs in the family.

01:07:53.573 --> 01:07:56.201
(gentle music)

01:07:58.661 --> 01:07:59.621
(Vivi sighs)

01:07:59.662 --> 01:08:04.959
Okay.

01:08:09.673 --> 01:08:13.176
(gentle music continues)

01:08:16.137 --> 01:08:18.890
Oh my.

01:08:18.932 --> 01:08:20.475
- Everything okay?

01:08:23.311 --> 01:08:24.521
- See these drawings?

01:08:26.690 --> 01:08:28.358
I was just a little kid.

01:08:31.403 --> 01:08:34.114
In almost every picture,
you guys are fighting,

01:08:34.155 --> 01:08:37.033
and I'm in the middle,
trying to make you get along.

01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:40.495
I fought so hard to
keep you together.

01:08:40.537 --> 01:08:41.371
- You know,

01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:46.459
we should have never put
you in that position.

01:08:46.501 --> 01:08:50.005
- I started keeping a mental
list of all of the things

01:08:50.046 --> 01:08:52.549
that a good relationship
had that yours didn't,

01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:54.092
but it wasn't about any guy.

01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:56.511
It wasn't even about me.

01:08:58.096 --> 01:09:02.392
It was about some
perfect partnership,

01:09:02.434 --> 01:09:04.019
but all I really
knew about perfect

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:08.898
came from surveys and
studies and anonymous data.

01:09:10.150 --> 01:09:14.279
Trying to optimize everything
only made things worse.

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.032
- Vivi, your mom and I only
ended up in a bad place

01:09:17.073 --> 01:09:21.536
because we didn't do the
work before we got married.

01:09:21.578 --> 01:09:25.123
- Yeah, we only cared
about the fun, the image,

01:09:25.165 --> 01:09:26.875
all the superficial stuff.

01:09:26.916 --> 01:09:28.251
- None of what we did

01:09:29.294 --> 01:09:32.756
has to apply to you
or your relationships.

01:09:32.797 --> 01:09:35.884
(gentle music)

01:09:35.925 --> 01:09:38.428
(Boom sighs)

01:09:45.769 --> 01:09:49.272
(gentle music continues)

01:09:56.029 --> 01:09:59.449
(gentle music continues)

01:10:05.789 --> 01:10:09.292
(gentle music continues)

01:10:12.295 --> 01:10:16.007
- Bhumesh, you haven't
come in for so long.

01:10:16.966 --> 01:10:18.927
You always walk
past the pooja room,

01:10:18.968 --> 01:10:20.470
but you never come in.

01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:22.222
Why?

01:10:23.723 --> 01:10:28.311
- Because it's just a constant
reminder that Dad's gone

01:10:29.062 --> 01:10:30.230
and it still really hurts,

01:10:31.606 --> 01:10:34.693
and, of course, you
miss him 10 times more.

01:10:34.734 --> 01:10:38.321
He was such a huge part of your
life and now you're just...

01:10:43.159 --> 01:10:44.077
Alone.

01:10:45.578 --> 01:10:48.081
Since Dad's been gone,
you've just been alone.

01:10:49.624 --> 01:10:51.209
- That's why you
suddenly took on

01:10:51.251 --> 01:10:53.169
a larger share of the business,

01:10:54.004 --> 01:10:56.006
started checking on me at home?

01:10:57.298 --> 01:11:01.177
You're here even now,
changing my light bulbs.

01:11:01.219 --> 01:11:04.097
You realize I know how to
use the TaskRabbit, right?

01:11:05.515 --> 01:11:09.644
- Jury's still out on
that one, Mom, but, yeah.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:16.192
Dad wouldn't have wanted you
to be alone and neither do I.

01:11:17.527 --> 01:11:20.697
- Is that why you won't
find a real relationship?

01:11:22.365 --> 01:11:25.577
Because you think
that, if you find love,

01:11:25.618 --> 01:11:27.370
it'll leave me even lonelier?

01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:33.710
You know where I
feel the most alone?

01:11:35.462 --> 01:11:36.671
In the pooja room.

01:11:38.631 --> 01:11:39.674
Please come.

01:11:41.593 --> 01:11:42.594
It's time.

01:11:42.635 --> 01:11:45.305
(gentle music)

01:11:46.806 --> 01:11:49.559
(Boom sniffles)

01:11:52.228 --> 01:11:55.273
- You know, of
course, sometimes,

01:11:55.315 --> 01:11:57.400
I feel sad without your father,

01:11:58.818 --> 01:12:02.072
but that's only because of
the great love we shared,

01:12:04.282 --> 01:12:06.159
and I take comfort in that.

01:12:08.078 --> 01:12:09.788
You should too.

01:12:13.249 --> 01:12:16.753
You're a good son for making
sure that I don't feel alone,

01:12:18.088 --> 01:12:21.633
but nothing will
make me more happy

01:12:21.675 --> 01:12:23.551
than seeing you find love.

01:12:26.096 --> 01:12:30.600
Respect the past, but eyes
toward the future, no?

01:12:35.146 --> 01:12:36.189
- I think

01:12:39.484 --> 01:12:42.487
going to India to
go see his family

01:12:44.072 --> 01:12:47.450
would help me make peace
with Dad being gone,

01:12:49.661 --> 01:12:51.246
and, once I'm done,

01:12:51.287 --> 01:12:53.498
it's time for you and
me to step into the now.

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:54.457
- Agreed.

01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:57.335
Plus, you're always around.

01:12:58.837 --> 01:13:00.630
I want some me time now.

01:13:01.673 --> 01:13:03.341
(Raina and Boom chuckle)

01:13:03.383 --> 01:13:08.388
(Boom sniffles)
(tender music)

01:13:22.819 --> 01:13:24.696
- I love you, Mom.

01:13:24.738 --> 01:13:25.822
- I love you.

01:13:25.864 --> 01:13:28.533
(tender music)

01:13:35.623 --> 01:13:37.125
- Right? And it is
important to me.

01:13:37.167 --> 01:13:38.835
So, keep that in
mind, all right?

01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:41.588
- Thanks. You wanted to see me?

01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:42.255
- We did, yes.

01:13:42.297 --> 01:13:43.465
Here. Come on in.

01:13:43.506 --> 01:13:44.591
Take a seat.

01:13:44.632 --> 01:13:45.717
- Thank you.

01:13:45.759 --> 01:13:48.094
- So, I'll get right to it.

01:13:48.136 --> 01:13:49.888
Your Raina Kumar experiment

01:13:49.929 --> 01:13:53.391
boosted our user base and
profits in the short term.

01:13:53.433 --> 01:13:56.561
Plus, I think a huge
percentage of our user base

01:13:56.603 --> 01:13:58.146
ended up in long-term
relationships.

01:13:58.188 --> 01:14:00.607
- Really? That's fantastic.

01:14:00.648 --> 01:14:03.360
I have so many more
ideas for us too.

01:14:03.401 --> 01:14:07.489
- Yes, your suggestions worked
well, a little too well.

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:09.616
(Adam chuckles)

01:14:09.657 --> 01:14:12.660
So, we crunched the numbers,
and in the long run,

01:14:12.702 --> 01:14:15.121
the most profitable
scenario for Data Mate

01:14:15.163 --> 01:14:18.333
is if our clients
are repeat users,

01:14:18.375 --> 01:14:23.463
coming back again and
again and again, so we are

01:14:24.464 --> 01:14:27.050
ending the Raina modifications.

01:14:27.092 --> 01:14:28.426
Yeah, if people are
gonna be confused

01:14:28.468 --> 01:14:30.053
and doubt their own instincts,

01:14:30.095 --> 01:14:31.888
might as well
capitalize on it, right?

01:14:33.181 --> 01:14:36.518
But you, Vivi, you've
shown your metal.

01:14:36.559 --> 01:14:38.311
(bright music)

01:14:38.353 --> 01:14:43.358
So, how does a promotion to
senior vice president sound?

01:14:44.359 --> 01:14:45.944
20% pay bump. Stock
options, of course.

01:14:50.907 --> 01:14:52.534
- I quit.

01:14:52.575 --> 01:14:55.328
(Vivi chuckles)

01:14:56.371 --> 01:14:59.040
- Now, remember that
you signed an NDA!

01:14:59.082 --> 01:15:01.042
- She didn't sign that NDA.

01:15:01.084 --> 01:15:02.043
(phone rings)

01:15:02.085 --> 01:15:03.169
- [Vivi] Hey, Raina. It's Vivi.

01:15:03.211 --> 01:15:04.295
- [Raina] Hi, Vivi.

01:15:04.337 --> 01:15:05.547
- I just wanted to call

01:15:05.588 --> 01:15:07.716
and apologize for
how I spoke to you.

01:15:07.757 --> 01:15:09.384
I was wrong.

01:15:09.426 --> 01:15:12.470
You have done nothing but
help me and care about me.

01:15:12.512 --> 01:15:14.931
- [Raina] Oh, enough. I accept.

01:15:14.973 --> 01:15:16.391
- I really messed things up.

01:15:16.433 --> 01:15:20.311
- [Raina] But, Vivi, if
you were your own obstacle

01:15:20.353 --> 01:15:24.315
to finding love, then you
can also clear your own path.

01:15:26.234 --> 01:15:28.111
- Raina, I've been
trying to call Boom too,

01:15:28.153 --> 01:15:29.946
but he's not
answering his phone.

01:15:29.988 --> 01:15:31.448
Do you know where he is?

01:15:31.489 --> 01:15:32.574
- [Raina] He's about to
leave for a trip to India.

01:15:32.615 --> 01:15:33.908
- What? When?

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:34.826
- [Raina] Right now.

01:15:34.868 --> 01:15:36.828
- Okay, okay, thank you. Bye.

01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:37.787
Nila!

01:15:39.998 --> 01:15:40.957
- Uh, what's going on?

01:15:40.999 --> 01:15:41.958
- I'll fill you in in the car.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.209
Can you give me a ride ASAP?

01:15:43.251 --> 01:15:44.627
- Of course. Yeah.

01:15:49.257 --> 01:15:50.300
- This is it!

01:15:53.094 --> 01:15:54.763
Oh, how do I look?

01:15:54.804 --> 01:15:56.264
- [Nila] Perfect.
Now, go, go, go, go!

01:15:56.306 --> 01:15:57.640
- Okay, okay!

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:02.062
(knocking on door)

01:16:06.399 --> 01:16:09.819
- Oh, no.
(solemn music)

01:16:09.861 --> 01:16:11.154
- Boom already left?

01:16:14.532 --> 01:16:16.618
Oh, I am so bummed.

01:16:17.786 --> 01:16:20.246
I really thought Raina was
gonna help you find your match.

01:16:20.288 --> 01:16:21.664
- Are we sure she didn't?

01:16:22.707 --> 01:16:24.584
I mean, all these weeks,

01:16:24.626 --> 01:16:28.004
I have learned so
much about who I am

01:16:28.046 --> 01:16:31.049
and why I do what I do.

01:16:31.091 --> 01:16:35.095
Actually, I think Raina's
process worked perfectly.

01:16:35.136 --> 01:16:36.763
I finally matched
with the person

01:16:36.805 --> 01:16:40.058
that I have needed
to all along, myself.

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:44.270
- And what about getting
married by your next birthday?

01:16:44.312 --> 01:16:46.606
- Forget any timeline.

01:16:47.941 --> 01:16:50.694
Boom will eventually come
back, and when he does,

01:16:50.735 --> 01:16:53.279
I will find him and we'll see.

01:16:54.739 --> 01:16:58.660
I am ready to embrace that love
will happen when it happens.

01:17:01.746 --> 01:17:03.790
Raina said you were headed
to a flight for India.

01:17:03.832 --> 01:17:06.793
- I was, but I had to
come see you first.

01:17:06.835 --> 01:17:08.420
- I'll give you guys a sec.

01:17:08.461 --> 01:17:10.422
(Vivi chuckles)

01:17:10.463 --> 01:17:11.423
- I was gonna go to your place,

01:17:11.464 --> 01:17:13.049
but Mom said you might be here.

01:17:13.091 --> 01:17:15.176
(Vivi and Boom chuckle)

01:17:15.218 --> 01:17:17.429
- I am sorry about how I acted.

01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:18.930
- I'm sorry too.

01:17:18.972 --> 01:17:20.682
I didn't know how wanting
to be with you could work

01:17:20.724 --> 01:17:23.852
with you as our clients, or
how you fit into my family,

01:17:23.893 --> 01:17:26.855
or if I was even brave enough
to risk feeling sadness

01:17:29.482 --> 01:17:31.359
in order to find joy with you.

01:17:31.401 --> 01:17:35.196
- I think we can
address these concerns.

01:17:35.238 --> 01:17:37.866
First off, you're fired.

01:17:39.492 --> 01:17:41.161
- No more conflict of interest,

01:17:42.454 --> 01:17:45.165
and as far as my family
dynamic, you make it better.

01:17:45.206 --> 01:17:46.541
You fit perfectly.

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:49.961
- So, I guess all
that's left is,

01:17:50.003 --> 01:17:51.880
are you willing
to take the risk?

01:17:54.424 --> 01:17:58.970
Boom, are you
finally chasing love?

01:17:59.012 --> 01:18:02.182
- Only if you're finally
letting love come to you.

01:18:02.223 --> 01:18:05.018
(uplifting music)

01:18:11.775 --> 01:18:15.320
(uplifting music continues)

01:18:15.362 --> 01:18:16.613
(knocking on door)

01:18:16.654 --> 01:18:17.739
Come in.

01:18:18.656 --> 01:18:19.491
Mom.

01:18:19.532 --> 01:18:20.408
- Bhumesh!

01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:24.204
Bhumesh.

01:18:25.455 --> 01:18:27.082
So handsome.

01:18:29.709 --> 01:18:31.961
Your father would be so proud.

01:18:34.756 --> 01:18:35.799
I am too.

01:18:38.802 --> 01:18:40.428
I love you better.

01:18:44.307 --> 01:18:46.685
- Oh, classic Indian mom moment.

01:18:46.726 --> 01:18:49.688
(Boom and Raina laugh)

01:18:49.729 --> 01:18:51.439
I love you too, Mom.

01:18:51.481 --> 01:18:54.234
(gentle music)

01:18:57.862 --> 01:18:59.656
- Nila, you look beautiful.

01:18:59.698 --> 01:19:01.282
- Me?

01:19:01.324 --> 01:19:03.243
Girl, I always knew you were
gonna make a beautiful bride,

01:19:03.284 --> 01:19:05.203
but this is unreal.

01:19:07.831 --> 01:19:12.502
- Vivi, we have another
good omen for the wedding.

01:19:12.544 --> 01:19:16.464
The Raina app, the first to
incorporate real matchmakers

01:19:16.506 --> 01:19:21.302
and Raina Kumar's principles,
is modernizing matchmaking.

01:19:21.344 --> 01:19:23.263
It's a smashing success!

01:19:23.304 --> 01:19:24.514
(Vivi and Nila squeal)

01:19:24.556 --> 01:19:26.975
And that is because
of you and Nila.

01:19:27.017 --> 01:19:30.729
- And you and Boom.
- Mhm.

01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:32.981
- This is a family business.

01:19:33.023 --> 01:19:35.025
- I'll see you both out there.

01:19:37.902 --> 01:19:40.488
- I want to give you something.

01:19:42.657 --> 01:19:45.869
- You are the
daughter I never had.

01:19:59.549 --> 01:20:03.470
(exciting music)
(crowd cheering)

01:20:03.511 --> 01:20:05.263
- The groom is here!

01:20:06.806 --> 01:20:09.476
(lively music)

01:20:16.524 --> 01:20:20.070
(lively music continues)

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:26.409
(vocalists singing
in foreign language)

01:20:31.831 --> 01:20:36.878
(vocalists continue singing
in foreign language)

01:20:37.253 --> 01:20:38.755
- Wow.

01:20:38.797 --> 01:20:43.343
(vocalist singing
in foreign language)

01:20:48.264 --> 01:20:53.353
(vocalist continues singing
in foreign language)

01:20:54.813 --> 01:20:57.857
(crowd applauding)

01:21:04.989 --> 01:21:09.953
(vocalist continues singing
in foreign language)

01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:20.463
(officiant speaking
in foreign language)

01:21:25.677 --> 01:21:30.890
(officiant continues
speaking in foreign language)

01:21:34.894 --> 01:21:39.524
(vocalist singing
in foreign language)

01:21:45.113 --> 01:21:49.993
(vocalists singing
in foreign language)

01:21:55.081 --> 01:22:00.128
(vocalists continue singing
in foreign language)

01:22:04.924 --> 01:22:07.594
(lively music)

01:22:12.307 --> 01:22:14.434
(vocalist singing
in foreign language)

01:22:14.476 --> 01:22:16.019
- [Nila] And, with that,

01:22:16.061 --> 01:22:18.855
the couple are now
officially married!

01:22:18.897 --> 01:22:22.025
(crowd applauding)

01:22:29.449 --> 01:22:34.579
(exciting music)
(singers vocalizing)

01:22:39.542 --> 01:22:43.129
(exciting music continues)

01:22:48.843 --> 01:22:50.762
(crowd applauds)

01:22:50.804 --> 01:22:52.430
(gentle music)

01:22:52.472 --> 01:22:57.143
* Maybe it's the
lovely night sky *

01:22:57.185 --> 01:23:02.232
* Telling us we're more
than just friends *

01:23:02.732 --> 01:23:04.734
(gentle music)

01:23:07.654 --> 01:23:09.322
- Seven steps down.

01:23:10.323 --> 01:23:12.283
- The rest of our lives to go.

01:23:12.325 --> 01:23:16.246
* If I fight too
hard, too hard *

01:23:16.287 --> 01:23:21.126
* I'd never let down my guard *

01:23:21.167 --> 01:23:25.547
* So, for now, can we pretend *

01:23:25.588 --> 01:23:29.843
* That we don't know yet *
(crowd cheering)

01:23:29.884 --> 01:23:33.138
* How the story ends *
