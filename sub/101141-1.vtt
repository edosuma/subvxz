02:05.709 --> 02:07.711
Hey. Hey.

02:10.914 --> 02:14.618
Who'd leave you all tied up, eh?
Handsome fella like you.

02:18.022 --> 02:19.556
Shit.

02:23.493 --> 02:25.695
You're a bit crazy,
aren't you?

02:29.633 --> 02:30.868
Bugger it.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.695
- I can pour my own.
- Yeah, you can pour it

02:58.728 --> 03:01.132
- all over the kitchen and I get to clean it up.
- Ow!

03:01.165 --> 03:03.633
- Don't hit your brother, Josh.
- He doesn't mind, Georgie.

03:03.667 --> 03:07.470
- I do mind.
- I'm going to trust your brother on that one, Josh. Stop it.

03:29.559 --> 03:31.128
Hello?

03:31.162 --> 03:33.030
We're bringing in the big one.

03:33.064 --> 03:35.933
We've got more crays
than we can bloody crate.

03:35.967 --> 03:38.135
Even had to empty the hold.

03:38.169 --> 03:39.703
Well, that's great.

03:39.736 --> 03:41.205
Would you get Beaver
on the docks?

03:41.238 --> 03:43.540
We're going to need
probably three vans.

03:43.573 --> 03:44.942
Maybe four.

03:47.912 --> 03:50.480
Good on you, Jimbo!

03:52.283 --> 03:54.517
Hey, Boris, tie it off.

03:54.551 --> 03:55.920
That's it, just there.

03:59.056 --> 04:01.792
Jim Buckridge,
the catch of the year!

04:14.872 --> 04:18.009
- Yogi.
- Good on you, Jim-Jim, mate.

04:18.041 --> 04:20.577
Cheers, Jimbo!

04:20.610 --> 04:22.913
Yogi. Ava.

04:22.947 --> 04:24.982
You want a red or a white?

04:29.253 --> 04:31.088
Hi.

04:31.122 --> 04:33.290
Buckridge! Buckridge!

04:33.324 --> 04:34.724
Buckridge!

04:38.829 --> 04:40.998
- Cheers.
- Hey, Georgie.

04:41.032 --> 04:42.967
- Get off!
- Fuck off, mate.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.035
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:46.837 --> 04:49.907
Your husband, he just earned
a nurse's annual salary.

04:49.940 --> 04:51.942
You know I used to be a nurse.

04:51.976 --> 04:54.744
- I do.
- And that he's not my husband.

04:56.881 --> 04:58.082
You know, you're the only one

04:58.115 --> 04:59.917
that wants to talk to me,
Beaver.

04:59.950 --> 05:01.952
You know, you're the only one
not smiling.

05:01.986 --> 05:03.788
You know that, don't you,
Georgie?

05:03.821 --> 05:05.622
Is that right?

05:05.655 --> 05:07.992
I mean, in this town,
if a Buckridge catches a whale,

05:08.025 --> 05:10.961
you slap on a smile
and you appreciate it.

05:10.995 --> 05:13.130
But you're not from this town,
are you?

05:18.235 --> 05:19.804
I'm going for a slash.

05:23.174 --> 05:26.277
"The large ships never pass by
without stopping.

05:28.645 --> 05:31.282
"On a small island
in a gigantic sea,

05:31.315 --> 05:33.751
Ari feels like he..."

05:53.938 --> 05:55.106
He got off late.

05:56.807 --> 05:58.809
Excited for you, I reckon.

06:00.077 --> 06:03.247
I took upwards
of 70 grand today.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.647
Maybe 80.

06:05.783 --> 06:06.884
That's great.

06:06.917 --> 06:08.718
Yeah.

06:08.752 --> 06:12.022
Well, shut the talkers up,
anyway.

06:12.056 --> 06:13.257
Talkers?

06:14.925 --> 06:17.428
Yeah, those that talk.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.430
And what are those that talk
saying?

06:19.463 --> 06:21.432
Oh, the usual White Point shit,
you know.

06:21.465 --> 06:23.733
I've lost my touch,
Father was better...

06:27.805 --> 06:29.874
Yeah, some of them
even talk about you.

06:45.722 --> 06:47.391
I'm drunk.
I'm going to go to bed.

07:12.116 --> 07:14.385
I hoped I'd see you again too!

07:47.084 --> 07:49.887
Hello. Good catch?

07:51.155 --> 07:52.823
Funny time to be out fishing.

07:54.425 --> 07:56.927
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone I saw you.

07:56.961 --> 07:59.029
You'd better hope
no one else sees you, though.

08:00.364 --> 08:01.932
Right.

08:01.966 --> 08:04.168
You do speak, then?

08:04.201 --> 08:06.337
I thought you were hurt.

08:06.370 --> 08:07.805
I thought you were a body.

08:08.872 --> 08:10.007
I am a body.

08:13.310 --> 08:15.279
You shouldn't leave your dog
tied up.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.948
It keeps him safe.

08:20.951 --> 08:22.052
Hmm.

08:34.898 --> 08:35.899
Morning.

08:35.933 --> 08:37.234
Bit of a swim?

08:41.005 --> 08:42.405
Swimming in the dark
on this coast?

08:42.438 --> 08:43.774
I wouldn't do it.

08:47.111 --> 08:49.113
Jim...

08:49.146 --> 08:51.515
we should probably talk.

08:51.548 --> 08:53.050
No, everything's fine.

08:55.185 --> 08:56.954
Don't overthink it.

10:12.096 --> 10:13.330
Oh, come on.

10:45.963 --> 10:47.464
Hello, again.

11:06.550 --> 11:08.252
Just choked and cut out.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.689
I've nearly killed the battery
turning it over.

11:18.662 --> 11:20.030
Injectors, maybe.

11:20.063 --> 11:21.331
Don't know.

11:21.365 --> 11:23.133
It's a computerized something.

11:23.167 --> 11:25.135
You know how these cars get.

11:25.169 --> 11:27.004
I'm not good with computers.

11:28.172 --> 11:29.373
Me neither.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.676
You call your service?

11:32.709 --> 11:35.012
No reception, not out here.

11:36.647 --> 11:38.182
Hey.

11:39.784 --> 11:41.652
Are you having
some kind of party?

11:44.455 --> 11:46.089
I guess I could run you in
to White Point.

11:47.224 --> 11:48.592
That'd be brave.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.565
Where'd you sell your catch?

11:54.598 --> 11:56.633
The city? Because that's
where I'm heading.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.202
I can't tow your car.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.272
Bust my transmission.

12:02.306 --> 12:03.640
I'm not fussed about the car.

12:07.611 --> 12:09.279
You're busy.

12:09.313 --> 12:11.048
You've got your party
to organize.

12:12.349 --> 12:13.717
I'm not having a party.

12:15.352 --> 12:17.120
You get going.

12:17.154 --> 12:19.490
Can't leave you
on the side of the road.

12:19.523 --> 12:20.724
Not in this heat.

12:23.427 --> 12:25.095
I got reason to fear you?

12:25.128 --> 12:27.030
Not that I know of.

12:30.601 --> 12:32.035
Fine.

12:42.279 --> 12:44.014
You talked me into it.

12:53.156 --> 12:55.392
What's he called?

12:55.425 --> 12:57.094
Doesn't have a name.

12:57.127 --> 12:59.363
He doesn't have a name?

12:59.396 --> 13:00.631
No.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.737
I need to sort something
at my house.

13:06.771 --> 13:08.105
It's on the way.

13:29.827 --> 13:32.129
There's shade over there.

13:32.162 --> 13:34.264
Don't have any paracetamol,
do you?

14:12.235 --> 14:13.203
Rain water.

14:13.236 --> 14:14.471
Shit-free.

14:16.607 --> 14:17.775
It's cooler inside.

14:17.809 --> 14:19.409
I'll just be a few minutes.

14:21.211 --> 14:22.412
Thanks.

15:24.274 --> 15:26.743
You're staying here.

15:30.347 --> 15:31.615
Big reader?

15:31.648 --> 15:33.918
Passes the time.

15:33.951 --> 15:35.585
Who do you read, then?

15:37.755 --> 15:39.322
Steinbeck, I'll bet.

15:40.724 --> 15:43.293
And Hemingway, obviously.

15:43.326 --> 15:45.696
Conrad?
I see you have a set.

15:49.266 --> 15:51.535
What about women writers?
You like any women?

15:51.568 --> 15:53.905
You live at White Point?

15:53.938 --> 15:56.640
I do, but you're changing
the subject.

15:56.673 --> 15:59.342
- Teacher?
- Fuck, no.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.012
Nurse.

16:01.045 --> 16:02.512
Ex-nurse.

16:03.613 --> 16:05.883
Why'd you guess teacher?

16:05.917 --> 16:07.952
Books.

16:07.985 --> 16:11.823
Your old man is an exporter
or a fisherman?

16:14.291 --> 16:15.459
You needn't worry.

16:15.492 --> 16:16.994
I'm not a very loyal fishwife.

16:21.298 --> 16:22.499
Jim Buckridge.

16:24.434 --> 16:26.603
- Fuck.
- If I was gonna say something,

16:26.636 --> 16:28.472
you don't think I'd have
said something by now?

16:28.505 --> 16:30.942
Your old man is Jim Buckridge.

16:30.975 --> 16:32.709
I haven't married him.

16:34.578 --> 16:35.880
What do you want with Perth?

16:35.913 --> 16:37.882
I got a room booked.

16:37.915 --> 16:39.784
I need a few days away.

16:39.817 --> 16:41.819
So you're running from him.

16:41.853 --> 16:45.022
I'm helping you... run away.

16:45.056 --> 16:48.692
You think that's dangerous,
try stealing from his plate.

16:48.725 --> 16:50.995
You do know what'll happen
if they catch you?

16:53.363 --> 16:56.901
All I'm saying is, why not take
up something less dangerous...

16:56.934 --> 16:58.602
like bomb disposal?

17:00.004 --> 17:01.438
Hands shake.

17:02.774 --> 17:03.740
What?

17:05.375 --> 17:07.344
Don't have the hands
for bomb disposal.

17:34.939 --> 17:36.506
You coming in?

17:36.540 --> 17:39.743
I'll buy you a beer.
I owe you one.

17:39.777 --> 17:42.646
Thanks.
I've got to be somewhere.

17:44.714 --> 17:46.650
I don't want to spoil
your plans,

17:46.683 --> 17:48.451
but I think this is one-way.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.754
Guess you're stuck.

17:51.923 --> 17:54.558
Weird old day,
that's all I was thinking.

17:56.961 --> 17:59.462
Weird old fucking life,
to be honest.

18:50.714 --> 18:53.450
Let's hope they've got
decent beer.

18:53.483 --> 18:54.919
None of that Belgian shit.

20:33.616 --> 20:36.120
What?

20:37.554 --> 20:39.290
We still have our clothes on.

20:48.332 --> 20:49.967
I don't know your name.

20:54.872 --> 20:57.775
I'm Georgie.
Georgie Jutland.

20:59.143 --> 21:00.878
Lu.

21:02.013 --> 21:03.280
Lu Fox.

21:05.116 --> 21:06.917
Pleased to meet you, Georgie.

21:09.020 --> 21:11.022
Very bloody pleased,
I hope.

21:15.092 --> 21:16.293
I've heard of you.

21:19.230 --> 21:21.132
What you heard?

21:21.165 --> 21:24.168
You're in some sort of band.

21:24.201 --> 21:26.070
You're a muso, right?

21:28.205 --> 21:29.739
Don't play anymore.

21:31.042 --> 21:32.243
No?

21:34.845 --> 21:36.213
Don't even listen.

21:39.749 --> 21:41.318
And that's all
you heard, is it?

21:43.754 --> 21:46.257
That's what the Foxes
are famous for.

21:48.059 --> 21:49.093
No.

21:51.628 --> 21:54.664
I heard what happened to you...

21:54.697 --> 21:56.133
and your family.

22:05.776 --> 22:07.610
Let's have that beer.

22:09.046 --> 22:10.848
I promised you a beer,
didn't I?

22:14.385 --> 22:15.820
The fridge is over there.

22:56.360 --> 22:57.328
Hey.

23:02.199 --> 23:04.001
You're worried
about your dog?

23:07.905 --> 23:09.240
He's not my dog.

23:14.078 --> 23:16.113
You're worried your fish
will have melted?

23:22.353 --> 23:23.821
They're crays.

23:27.291 --> 23:28.725
And technically...

23:32.729 --> 23:34.731
they're not my fish to melt.

- What?

25:11.428 --> 25:13.797
What'd he look like?

25:13.831 --> 25:15.132
A dot.

25:15.165 --> 25:16.967
A dot in a circle, sort of.

25:17.001 --> 25:19.370
When I close my eye
and poke it with my thumb,

25:19.403 --> 25:22.172
he floats across the sky.

25:22.206 --> 25:24.174
Right into the sun, even.

25:24.208 --> 25:27.845
No one else can go on the sun,
right?

25:28.946 --> 25:30.814
Are you playing tonight?

25:30.848 --> 25:33.317
White Point.
Your dad's booking.

25:33.350 --> 25:36.053

- You got school tomorrow, Bird.

You sound like an employee.

26:10.587 --> 26:12.056
I was worried,
that's all.

26:18.128 --> 26:20.264
Did you get what you wanted
on your breather?

26:22.066 --> 26:24.268
I think so.

26:24.301 --> 26:25.969
When Debbie got
her diagnosis,

26:26.003 --> 26:28.872
she took off for a few days.

26:28.906 --> 26:31.542
Didn't say anything,
she just up and went.

26:33.377 --> 26:35.079
I'm not sick, Jim.

26:36.513 --> 26:38.248
No, I didn't think you were.

26:40.184 --> 26:41.919
And I'm not Debbie.

28:02.566 --> 28:05.302
I don't understand what
you're doing living like this.

28:07.070 --> 28:09.072
I did think about
going north.

28:11.275 --> 28:14.311
The last funeral,
I came back...

28:14.344 --> 28:19.183
burned all my papers,
licenses, any ID.

28:22.219 --> 28:24.221
I wish I'd burned
everything.

28:27.024 --> 28:29.026
I already felt like a ghost.

28:29.059 --> 28:30.360
Figured, why not become one?

28:34.364 --> 28:36.768
So now you poach
other people's fish,

28:36.801 --> 28:39.503
read man books
and don't listen to music.

28:41.405 --> 28:42.406
Come on.

28:43.808 --> 28:45.742
I've got somewhere
to show you.

28:49.146 --> 28:51.014
I should have worn shoes.

28:51.048 --> 28:52.749
You want a piggyback?

28:54.752 --> 28:56.119
Come on.

28:56.153 --> 28:58.088
Gonna get up or not?

29:00.190 --> 29:01.258
Oh!

29:06.129 --> 29:08.198
Aah!

29:14.204 --> 29:15.472
Hi.

29:17.407 --> 29:19.510
Your dog slobbered on me.

29:19.543 --> 29:22.045
Good boy. He likes you.

29:25.148 --> 29:26.650
Used to come here a lot.

29:26.683 --> 29:28.285
Bird loved it.

29:29.653 --> 29:32.256
She said once,
"This is my place."

29:33.490 --> 29:34.826
Sort of declared,

29:34.859 --> 29:36.326
"This is my country."

29:36.360 --> 29:37.762
Bird's your...?

29:37.795 --> 29:39.029
Niece.

29:40.464 --> 29:41.698
She was my niece.

29:50.507 --> 29:52.442
Didn't used to be illegal,
what I do.

29:53.845 --> 29:55.746
Then suddenly everyone's
paying everyone

29:55.780 --> 29:57.614
for bits of paper that tell us

29:57.648 --> 29:59.616
the Foxes can't
go fishing no more.

30:00.752 --> 30:02.519
So we farmed melons.

30:04.288 --> 30:07.090
Weren't any good at that,
so we played music.

30:10.627 --> 30:14.197
You ever heard of a place
called Coronation Gulf?

30:14.231 --> 30:17.869
Chain of islands up north,
way out in the Timor Sea.

30:17.902 --> 30:19.236
Far north.

30:20.704 --> 30:23.607
I got stuck on one
of the islands once.

30:23.640 --> 30:25.142
Are you a sailor, then?

30:27.177 --> 30:28.846
If I was a sailor,

30:28.880 --> 30:31.315
I wouldn't have got stuck
on a sandbank for two days.

30:33.684 --> 30:35.552
But the place?

30:35.586 --> 30:37.721
Mostly scrub or thick trees,

30:37.755 --> 30:40.792
mangroves, boab trees,
crocs,

30:40.825 --> 30:43.193
fish, birds...

30:43.226 --> 30:45.529
no humans.

30:45.562 --> 30:47.865
- None?
- Complete peace.

30:49.901 --> 30:53.136
So isolated
it could kill me.

30:54.906 --> 30:56.640
That kind of isolation's
good to have

30:56.673 --> 30:58.342
once in a while,
you know?

30:59.877 --> 31:01.913
And there was this moment,
when the tides changed,

31:01.946 --> 31:03.881
that the whole ocean
came alive.

31:05.817 --> 31:08.151
This big, heaving,
living thing

31:08.185 --> 31:11.688
that makes you feel so small
you might not even exist.

31:16.326 --> 31:17.694
My point is,

31:17.728 --> 31:20.497
I get why Bird liked it here.

31:20.530 --> 31:22.299
Because that's my place.

31:23.968 --> 31:25.335
My country.

31:30.942 --> 31:32.309
What are we doing?

31:35.545 --> 31:36.814
Hanging out.

31:36.848 --> 31:38.682
What do you think
we're doing?

31:38.715 --> 31:41.218
We're not teenagers.

31:41.251 --> 31:43.353
How do adults do it, then?

31:43.387 --> 31:44.354
You still fucking him?

31:46.256 --> 31:47.925
You want me to stop?

31:47.959 --> 31:50.795
Done. You got me.

31:50.828 --> 31:53.597
You haven't lived in White Point
long enough, you know that?

32:06.476 --> 32:08.545
- Hey, Georgie?
- Yeah.

32:08.578 --> 32:11.949
We're going to need an ambulance
on the jetty in half an hour.

32:11.983 --> 32:14.418
And can you find us
a new deckie?

32:14.451 --> 32:15.987
Boris is out of it.

32:16.020 --> 32:17.688
He's got blood from asshole
to breakfast.

32:17.721 --> 32:19.757
- Is he conscious?
- Don't use the radio.

32:19.791 --> 32:21.926
I've only pulled two lines.

32:21.959 --> 32:23.727
Don't need a pack
of nature's gentlemen

32:23.761 --> 32:25.395
pillaging me pots, all right?

32:25.429 --> 32:26.831
Okay.

32:26.864 --> 32:28.833
- Head injury.
- Up he goes.

32:28.866 --> 32:30.333
There you go, Boris.

32:30.367 --> 32:31.601
There you go, mate.

32:31.635 --> 32:33.470
Here. The pupils on him.

32:33.503 --> 32:35.405
You fucked up, Boris, eh?

32:35.439 --> 32:37.507
- Yeah.
- What can I do?

32:37.541 --> 32:39.777
Well, I don't know, love.
What can you do?

32:39.811 --> 32:41.511
You should probably
keep him warm

32:41.545 --> 32:42.880
in case he goes into shock.

32:42.914 --> 32:44.882
We got this, Georgie, eh?

32:44.916 --> 32:46.583
Boris, can you hear me, Boris?

32:46.616 --> 32:47.985
Hey? You fucked yourself.

32:48.019 --> 32:49.821
Hey, who's up?

32:49.854 --> 32:51.655
Yup.

32:51.688 --> 32:53.523
Is that the best you could find?

32:54.926 --> 32:56.526
All right, kid,
what are you waiting for,

32:56.560 --> 32:58.528
a printed fucking invitation?
Come on, get on.

33:00.765 --> 33:01.899
Hey, don't die, Boris.

33:14.912 --> 33:18.381
And then he tried to tell me
he could run faster than me,

33:18.415 --> 33:20.283
but we had a race
and I easily beat him.

33:20.317 --> 33:22.352
Well, I hope you made him
feel okay about that.

33:22.385 --> 33:25.322
I beat him. He is never going
to feel okay about that.

33:27.925 --> 33:29.459
How was it?

33:29.493 --> 33:31.628
Pots might as well
have been pillaged.

33:31.661 --> 33:33.798
- That bad?
- Yeah.

33:33.831 --> 33:34.966
And Boris?

33:36.868 --> 33:39.937
Oh, he needed a few stitches,
but he was never pretty.

33:43.941 --> 33:45.742
I'm a nurse, Jim.

33:45.777 --> 33:47.744
I could have helped
with Boris.

33:47.779 --> 33:49.981
Yeah, well, you did.
You got Yogi and Ava.

33:50.014 --> 33:52.784
- Jim.
- I called you, didn't I, to sort it out?

33:52.817 --> 33:54.384
You do that as a favor.

33:56.553 --> 33:59.056
Well, you've got your life,
I've got mine.

33:59.090 --> 34:00.792
That's how it works,
doesn't it?

35:31.983 --> 35:33.851
Fuck you,
Jim Buckridge.

36:41.252 --> 36:42.954
You vicious bastard!

36:42.987 --> 36:45.022
- Hey, what state are you in?
- Have you hurt him?

36:45.056 --> 36:46.489
- Hey, hey!
- Did you hurt him?

36:46.523 --> 36:47.724
What have you done?

36:47.758 --> 36:48.993
What have you done to him?!

36:49.026 --> 36:50.627
I've fucking done nothing!

36:50.660 --> 36:52.163
What did you do, eh?
What did you do?

36:52.196 --> 36:53.730
As soon as he touched you,

36:53.764 --> 36:55.266
his hands should have
fucking burned.

36:55.299 --> 36:57.034
- Fuck you!
- Yeah?

37:02.006 --> 37:04.942
Go in the spare room
and sober up, for fuck's sake.

37:33.771 --> 37:35.638
I've got a fucking machine!

37:38.075 --> 37:39.944
I don't understand a word
you're saying, love.

37:44.015 --> 37:46.616
Georgie, I've got
a fucking machine.

37:46.649 --> 37:49.320
I think she thinks there's
too much oil in your clothes.

37:49.353 --> 37:51.288
She doesn't want to fuck up
your machine.

37:51.322 --> 37:53.791
Yeah, but if I fuck up my
machine, I'll fix my machine.

37:53.824 --> 37:55.960
I'm a mechanic.
I'm a mechanic!

37:55.993 --> 37:57.560
I didn't know
you'd met someone.

37:59.196 --> 38:01.564
Haven't you heard them
laughing at me yet?

38:01.598 --> 38:03.034
- No.
- Yeah.

38:03.067 --> 38:04.969
Proper love match.

38:06.370 --> 38:08.105
I need a car, Beaver.

38:08.139 --> 38:11.142
Now, why would I do
something stupid like that?

38:11.175 --> 38:13.676
Because I'll pay you.

38:13.710 --> 38:16.814
One car, one night.
That's all I need.

38:18.783 --> 38:21.919
Now, you promise to return this,
Georgie, by morning.

38:21.952 --> 38:23.720
I'm the one
taking the risk here.

38:23.754 --> 38:25.089
If he notices or even knows...

38:25.122 --> 38:26.589
I know.

39:07.798 --> 39:09.732
I can see you!

39:09.767 --> 39:11.769
I can fucking see you!

39:11.802 --> 39:13.971
Lu?

39:17.408 --> 39:18.708
Lu.

39:38.996 --> 39:40.331
This alcohol?

39:42.466 --> 39:43.934
Darkie brewed it.

39:49.306 --> 39:50.274
Fuck.

40:10.928 --> 40:12.296
Trust me, Lu Fox.

40:25.776 --> 40:28.279
How'd you meet him?
Jim.

40:30.881 --> 40:33.350
You want me to talk about Jim?

40:33.384 --> 40:35.853
I want to understand.

40:35.886 --> 40:37.254
Understand what?

40:39.390 --> 40:41.025
Why you'd want him and me.

40:42.927 --> 40:45.763
I ended up in this resort
in Bali.

40:47.131 --> 40:48.799
Jim was there.

40:51.135 --> 40:53.137
I didn't know it at the time,

40:53.170 --> 40:56.173
but it was the first holiday
he'd had without his wife.

40:56.207 --> 40:57.808
Debbie.

41:01.378 --> 41:04.215
I saw him on the beach
with his kids.

41:04.248 --> 41:06.150
Started playing with them.

41:07.484 --> 41:09.286
Things just happened.

41:09.320 --> 41:11.989
Maybe I just settled
for something

41:12.022 --> 41:13.224
rather than nothing.

41:16.060 --> 41:20.130
He said you should have realized
what it meant to touch me,

41:20.164 --> 41:22.433
as if I was his property or...

41:26.036 --> 41:27.938
Bird was alive for a while.

41:29.840 --> 41:31.208
After the...

41:33.310 --> 41:34.878
Did you know that?

41:37.081 --> 41:38.249
On machines.

41:40.184 --> 41:42.853
They kept shoving
all these forms at me.

41:45.089 --> 41:47.057
I didn't want to do it.

41:47.091 --> 41:49.994
And I stayed and stayed.

41:50.027 --> 41:52.763
It's like I got tired,
you know?

41:54.832 --> 41:56.133
They wore me down.

41:59.103 --> 42:02.306
Signed them, and like that...
she was gone.

42:06.510 --> 42:09.146
Sounds like mercy to me.

42:09.179 --> 42:10.948
It was convenience.

42:13.384 --> 42:17.021
Music will undo you,
because it makes you forget.

42:17.054 --> 42:19.023
It takes you somewhere else.

42:21.492 --> 42:25.996
Whatever's been done to you,
whatever you do to yourself,

42:26.030 --> 42:28.499
it's not allowed,
you know?

42:28.532 --> 42:30.301
You're not getting
that convenience.

42:30.334 --> 42:32.036
It's too convenient.

42:33.270 --> 42:35.039
I'm a burning,
screaming wreck.

42:42.546 --> 42:44.081
And I'll always be one.

42:50.521 --> 42:52.923
But I knew what it meant
to touch you.

43:57.621 --> 43:59.022
Beaver?

44:02.626 --> 44:05.462
Beaver? I've got your car.

44:05.496 --> 44:06.964
Are you awake?

44:09.666 --> 44:12.403
Hey, call your sister.

44:12.436 --> 44:14.138
Call your sister. She's been
trying to get ahold of you.

44:14.171 --> 44:15.606
So you're just here
to pass a message on?

44:15.639 --> 44:17.307
Where have you been?
With him?

44:17.341 --> 44:19.543
That is no fucking business
of yours.

44:19.576 --> 44:22.379
Georgie, whatever you think
happened, it fucking didn't.

44:23.514 --> 44:24.581
You're an animal.

44:24.615 --> 44:25.682
Georgie...

44:25.716 --> 44:27.251
Stay away from me.

44:28.652 --> 44:30.387
Georgie, your mum's dead.

44:35.025 --> 44:36.293
I'm sorry.

44:37.461 --> 44:39.062
Call your sister.

44:46.336 --> 44:49.673
♪ I will put ♪

44:49.706 --> 44:53.010
♪ My ship in order ♪

44:55.145 --> 44:59.383
♪ And I will set her ♪

44:59.416 --> 45:01.718
♪ To the sea ♪

45:12.129 --> 45:13.430
Sorry, Bird.

45:16.266 --> 45:18.502
The thing is...

45:18.535 --> 45:21.004
you've always been a pussy
when it came to the women.

45:21.038 --> 45:23.507
- Leave him alone, Darkie.
- I'm not saying I'm any better.

45:24.776 --> 45:27.044
Women make no home safer.

45:27.077 --> 45:29.346
They twist any brain.

45:29.379 --> 45:31.482
You want me to twist
your brain?

45:31.515 --> 45:33.050
Give it a go.

45:33.083 --> 45:34.218
Bird?

45:41.592 --> 45:42.659
Bird?

46:41.451 --> 46:42.820
Hi, Uncle Derek.

46:46.723 --> 46:48.225
- Drink?
- No.

46:48.258 --> 46:49.761
Yes.

46:49.794 --> 46:51.361
Vodka martini.

46:54.431 --> 46:56.099
Pool man found her.

47:03.841 --> 47:06.176
- How long was she...?
- Twelve hours.

47:17.789 --> 47:19.556
Oh, it's too horrible.

47:19.590 --> 47:20.825
How are you, sis?

47:21.926 --> 47:23.493
Underdressed.

47:25.395 --> 47:27.130
It's been too long, Jude.

47:27.164 --> 47:28.732
It has been too long,
hasn't it?

47:30.367 --> 47:31.903
- I didn't mean...
- Yeah, I know.

47:31.936 --> 47:34.872
We grow up and we go to live
abroad and then on boats,

47:34.906 --> 47:37.708
and then with fishermen
who don't like our family.

47:37.741 --> 47:39.877
- Jim likes you.
- Does he?

47:41.846 --> 47:43.614
Dad's coming over.

47:43.647 --> 47:45.248
Shit.

47:45.282 --> 47:46.818
And he's got that look
on his face.

47:46.851 --> 47:48.218
Georgina.

47:49.887 --> 47:51.655
Learned counsel.

47:51.688 --> 47:53.290
Mm.

47:53.323 --> 47:54.826
Good Lord.

47:54.859 --> 47:56.894
That's some tan.

47:56.928 --> 47:58.896
You got a bit of color there
yourself.

47:58.930 --> 48:01.632
Well, we get out on the boat
to Rottnest most weekends.

48:01.665 --> 48:03.533
You still get out?

48:03.567 --> 48:05.937
Think my sailing days
are behind me.

48:05.970 --> 48:07.704
Turned 40, you know.

48:07.738 --> 48:09.740
I loved watching you
on the water,

48:09.774 --> 48:11.776
pushing yourself
to the limit.

48:11.809 --> 48:13.577
You even sailed to Indonesia.

48:15.980 --> 48:17.714
You brought her?

48:19.216 --> 48:21.251
My wife?
Yes, I did, Georgie.

48:21.284 --> 48:23.487
You brought your wife
to your ex-wife's funeral.

48:23.520 --> 48:25.555
She's not coming to the funeral,
but I didn't think

48:25.589 --> 48:27.524
there was any harm
in bringing her here today.

48:28.993 --> 48:32.229
Seeing you girls,
you know, seeing you...

48:32.262 --> 48:34.631
she always said
you had her smile.

48:34.665 --> 48:36.500
Oh, God, I can see it now.

48:36.533 --> 48:38.502
Freshwater Bay, 1972.

48:38.535 --> 48:40.872
- Dad, don't.
- Some university bash.

48:40.905 --> 48:43.206
- Dad, please.
- She had a mauve cashmere sweater.

48:43.240 --> 48:44.541
I'm not reminiscing with you.

48:44.574 --> 48:46.510
- Her hair flying in the wind,
- Stop!

48:46.543 --> 48:48.880
- like Faye Dunaway.
- I said, stop.

48:48.913 --> 48:51.648
- I just want you to understand.
- I refuse to understand.

48:51.682 --> 48:53.951
That's a very pleasing way
to live your life, isn't it?

48:53.985 --> 48:56.420
Did you know it was 12 hours?

48:57.521 --> 48:59.523
No one found her for 12 hours.

48:59.556 --> 49:01.324
Well, you weren't there either,
Georgie.

49:01.358 --> 49:02.894
Shared guilt's still guilt, Dad.

49:02.927 --> 49:06.798
- Well, I'm upset too.
- Didn't say upset.

49:06.831 --> 49:09.767
- Did I say upset?
- Come on, Georgie, let's...

49:09.801 --> 49:13.303
- Doesn't this all feel wrong?
- Let's keep this civilized.

49:13.336 --> 49:15.539
And why the fuck would we want
to keep it civilized?

51:12.757 --> 51:14.524
Jim didn't do anything either,
Georgie.

51:15.993 --> 51:17.594
At least you both
got your stories straight.

51:17.627 --> 51:20.697
Hey, he wasn't too happy
that someone did.

51:20.730 --> 51:23.633
He's trying to find out who actually
did it, to tell you the truth.

51:23.667 --> 51:26.636
Besides, someone coming back
for seconds? Couldn't happen.

51:26.670 --> 51:30.775

he's not here.

01:00:27.311 --> 01:00:29.213

01:00:29.246 --> 01:00:31.181
No, Beaver told me he left.

01:00:31.215 --> 01:00:34.118
So you're here standing outside

01:00:34.151 --> 01:00:35.519
Yogi did it.

01:00:35.552 --> 01:00:38.322
- Yogi?
- Yeah. Yeah, and Ava.

01:00:38.355 --> 01:00:40.324
And a gaggle of his cousins.

01:00:40.357 --> 01:00:42.593
Buckridge name probably
means as much to Yogi and Ava

01:00:42.626 --> 01:00:43.994

01:00:46.163 --> 01:00:48.699
I'm not saying I have no
responsibility for what Yogi did.

01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:51.101
Truth is, I've probably got
less responsibility

01:00:51.135 --> 01:00:53.070
than what you've got.

01:00:53.103 --> 01:00:56.940
And as for him...-
ah, Foxes...

01:00:56.974 --> 01:00:58.575
always where you don't
want them.

01:00:58.609 --> 01:01:00.911
- Always have been.
- You knew them well, then?

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:05.716
I never went after you, Georgie.
I didn't even see you.

01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:08.051
I probably wouldn't
have even noticed you

01:01:08.085 --> 01:01:09.253
if you hadn't come bounding
up the beach

01:01:09.286 --> 01:01:10.454
that day to play with the kids.

01:01:10.487 --> 01:01:12.322
You fucked me the second day.

01:01:12.356 --> 01:01:13.624
You know what you saw in me?

01:01:13.657 --> 01:01:16.260
A ready-made family.
A gap to fill.

01:01:18.128 --> 01:01:19.163
I thought you were
in the business

01:01:19.196 --> 01:01:20.564
of filling it permanently.

01:01:20.597 --> 01:01:22.533
I don't know.
I can deal with that.

01:01:24.368 --> 01:01:26.270
The boys, the boys...

01:01:26.303 --> 01:01:27.571
the boys, they've lost
their mother,

01:01:27.604 --> 01:01:29.506
and now you're walking out
on them.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.142
I'm not walking out on them,
Jim.

01:01:32.176 --> 01:01:33.644
I'm walking out on you.

01:01:33.677 --> 01:01:36.146
Well, they don't
see it like that.

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.348
That's why I'm saying,
come home.

01:01:38.382 --> 01:01:39.550
We can work it out again.

01:01:59.736 --> 01:02:01.505

01:02:01.538 --> 01:02:03.006
A thousand bucks.

01:02:10.247 --> 01:02:12.115
You're keen.

01:02:12.149 --> 01:02:13.684
You don't have to pay today,
you know.

01:02:13.717 --> 01:02:15.452

01:02:17.087 --> 01:02:19.323
- Coming back when?
- One way.

01:02:21.191 --> 01:02:22.626
You got an HF radio?

01:02:23.727 --> 01:02:24.762
No.

01:02:27.264 --> 01:02:29.166
Are you in trouble, son?

01:02:30.667 --> 01:02:32.736
Only if you can't
fly a plane.

01:02:35.138 --> 01:02:37.508
Are you stopping on the plateau?

01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:41.078
Of course you aren't.

01:02:41.111 --> 01:02:43.146

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:45.749
Suppose I'll be
coming back for you.

01:02:47.284 --> 01:02:49.186
One way or another.

01:02:49.219 --> 01:02:51.321
Don't think I haven't seen
others like you before.

01:02:51.355 --> 01:02:53.390
Always ends the same.

01:02:55.692 --> 01:02:58.629
You want me to give
anyone a message?

01:02:58.662 --> 01:02:59.730
No.

01:03:01.732 --> 01:03:03.634
I didn't even get your name.

01:03:06.236 --> 01:03:07.337
Buckridge.

01:03:23.788 --> 01:03:26.356

- Who's there?

01:03:27.792 --> 01:03:29.226
From the government?

01:03:29.259 --> 01:03:31.261
- No.
- Lawyer fella?

01:03:31.295 --> 01:03:33.363
Why would a lawyer come here?

01:03:33.397 --> 01:03:35.198
Oh, you'd be surprised.

01:03:35.232 --> 01:03:37.434

Station boy?

01:03:37.467 --> 01:03:39.102
No.

01:03:39.136 --> 01:03:40.537
Well, you're sure not
a black fella.

01:03:42.172 --> 01:03:43.340
Where are you from?

01:03:43.373 --> 01:03:45.442
White Point.

01:03:48.645 --> 01:03:50.180
You know where you're headed?

01:03:53.918 --> 01:03:56.587
You don't want to tell me that,
I can respect that.

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.856
But you won't make anywhere
before light.

01:03:58.890 --> 01:04:00.825

01:04:07.664 --> 01:04:08.866
Yeah, you see him.

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.300
You see him good.

01:04:10.334 --> 01:04:11.869
Get that billy on, brah.

01:04:13.871 --> 01:04:16.406
He likes to strum,
but he gets disappointed.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.241
I could tune it for him.

01:04:18.275 --> 01:04:20.410
Gentleman wants
to tune your guitar, Axle.

01:04:20.444 --> 01:04:22.814
Can you play?
Play.

01:04:22.847 --> 01:04:24.916
I'll tune it so you can play it.

01:04:24.949 --> 01:04:26.316
No, you play.

01:04:27.885 --> 01:04:29.620
I don't.

01:04:29.653 --> 01:04:32.389
Man wants you to play,
I'd play something, Lu,

01:04:32.422 --> 01:04:34.826
if you don't want this fella
humbugging you all night.

01:04:34.859 --> 01:04:36.293

No, Bird, no.

I'll get some...

01:08:15.512 --> 01:08:17.782
Used to be able to walk
everywhere out here.

01:08:17.814 --> 01:08:20.051
Now you need a boat.

01:08:20.084 --> 01:08:21.819
So take mine.

01:08:23.921 --> 01:08:26.523
Well, Menzies said you don't
even know where you're going.

01:08:26.555 --> 01:08:28.457
I think you need it
more than I do.

01:10:09.026 --> 01:10:11.095
- Hey, Georgie! Hey.
- Hey, Georgie.

01:10:19.536 --> 01:10:21.005
How are you going?

01:10:21.038 --> 01:10:23.240
You want to try?
Try and get some food?

01:10:32.049 --> 01:10:33.184
- Mm.
- Good?

01:10:33.217 --> 01:10:34.617
Mm-hm.

01:10:37.154 --> 01:10:39.656
Here.

01:10:39.689 --> 01:10:41.691
Dad, I caught 22 crabs.

01:10:41.725 --> 01:10:43.160
Twenty-two, did you?

01:10:43.194 --> 01:10:46.230
And only 14 of them bit me.

01:10:46.263 --> 01:10:49.233
Yeah, I'm just here
to rustle them home.

01:10:49.266 --> 01:10:52.003
Well, we cooked some crabs
if you want one.

01:10:54.671 --> 01:10:57.674
What are you up to this time,
Georgie, do you know?

01:10:57.707 --> 01:11:00.543
I don't want to promise them
something you can't deliver on.

01:11:00.577 --> 01:11:03.881
They'll get over me.
That's what I needed to check.

01:11:03.914 --> 01:11:05.715
They'll be fine.

01:11:05.749 --> 01:11:07.018
Okay, so, what?

01:11:07.051 --> 01:11:08.285
This is goodbye, then?

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:12.655
I believe you.

01:11:12.689 --> 01:11:14.058
I believe you didn't
hurt him.

01:11:14.091 --> 01:11:15.860
All right, but you're
still going.

01:11:15.893 --> 01:11:18.829
I've been thinking about Mum
a lot lately.

01:11:21.866 --> 01:11:25.102
One time, they were all
dressed up for dinner.

01:11:25.136 --> 01:11:28.773
Mum was wearing this
tight pink dress.

01:11:28.806 --> 01:11:29.974
Backless, you know?

01:11:30.007 --> 01:11:31.641
So beautiful.

01:11:31.674 --> 01:11:33.710
And Dad says,

01:11:33.743 --> 01:11:35.980
"Lights on, nobody home,

01:11:36.013 --> 01:11:38.783
but such pretty lights."

01:11:38.816 --> 01:11:40.583
I wouldn't talk about you
like that.

01:11:41.852 --> 01:11:43.854
I can't do unhappy.

01:11:47.825 --> 01:11:49.626
Where are you going?

01:11:49.659 --> 01:11:51.594
You going to go
looking for him?

01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:54.832

- We're packing.

01:15:52.069 --> 01:15:54.004
- To go where?
- Good question.

01:15:54.038 --> 01:15:56.173
They're just going
to my sister's.

01:15:56.206 --> 01:15:59.877
They're very excited about it.
She's got sheep and cows, dogs.

01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:01.845
You're sending them away?

01:16:01.879 --> 01:16:03.447
Yeah, just till
it's settled.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.416
Till what's settled?

01:16:05.449 --> 01:16:08.452
Oh, Boris can skipper the boat,
see how he does.

going to do, Jim?

Well, if you're gonna go
and look for him, so am I.

Your handwriting?

01:16:31.208 --> 01:16:34.311
Postmark is Cape Leveque.
That's where to start.

How long have you had this?
This is time I've lost.

01:16:37.381 --> 01:16:39.516
- He could be anywhere by now.
- I know that area.

01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:41.285
I've got cousins who live there.

01:16:41.318 --> 01:16:43.354
You want to find him,
you're going to need me,

01:16:43.387 --> 01:16:45.322

Madam?

01:17:42.312 --> 01:17:43.480

he's in the Coronation Gulf?

01:18:11.542 --> 01:18:14.178
I know he's in
the Coronation Gulf.

01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:16.747
You realize how big the gulf is,
don't you?

01:18:16.781 --> 01:18:18.449
Could take some time.

01:18:26.056 --> 01:18:28.225

01:18:28.258 --> 01:18:30.527
Not to me.

No, no, no.

01:18:38.068 --> 01:18:39.570
Have you seen this man?

01:18:41.338 --> 01:18:44.208
We've all been trying
to work this guy out.

01:18:45.409 --> 01:18:47.110
You his sister?

01:18:47.144 --> 01:18:49.079
Or his missus?
Fuck, are you Mrs. Buckridge?

01:18:49.112 --> 01:18:50.514
Buckridge?

01:18:50.547 --> 01:18:52.649
Can you take me
where you left him?

01:18:52.683 --> 01:18:54.451
He wasn't stopping
where I left him.

01:18:54.485 --> 01:18:56.220
Heading out to the gulf,
I reckon.

01:19:18.208 --> 01:19:19.543
You're not coming.

01:19:19.576 --> 01:19:21.178
Not to the islands.

01:19:25.649 --> 01:19:27.819
Yeah, I got you where
I needed to get you.

01:19:27.852 --> 01:19:31.255
You'll use a guide that
I've set up for you out there.

01:19:31.288 --> 01:19:33.457
He's good.
He's a fisherman mainly,

01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:35.692
but he knows the islands
pretty well.

01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:41.732
What's this about, Jim?

01:19:43.801 --> 01:19:45.602
Whatever's in that tight
head of yours,

01:19:45.636 --> 01:19:48.238
it might be better
to say it.

01:19:48.272 --> 01:19:50.507
Yeah, you might not be right
about that.

01:19:52.109 --> 01:19:54.111
I need to know
why you're here.

01:19:59.683 --> 01:20:03.120
Um...

01:20:03.153 --> 01:20:05.322
well, Debbie was sick.

01:20:05.355 --> 01:20:09.393
She was badly sick.
And I was, um...

01:20:09.426 --> 01:20:11.228
I was...

01:20:11.261 --> 01:20:13.096
Look, I'm not even going to try
and excuse it,

01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:15.532
but she came to me,
it wasn't the other way around.

01:20:15.566 --> 01:20:16.567
Who?

01:20:17.902 --> 01:20:19.771
Sal.

01:20:19.804 --> 01:20:23.140
Sal Fox.
Darkie's wife.

01:20:23.173 --> 01:20:25.375
I don't know how he found out,
but he...

01:20:25.409 --> 01:20:27.444
spat in my face,
then he took a knife to me.

01:20:27.477 --> 01:20:29.680
Fucking no one takes
a fucking knife to me.

01:20:31.315 --> 01:20:33.550
And, you know, I just...

01:20:35.252 --> 01:20:37.254
I just wanted to scare him
a little, you know,

01:20:37.287 --> 01:20:40.290
give him a scare, but...

01:20:40.324 --> 01:20:43.226
we were both pretty drunk,
and, um...

01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:46.196
when he left the bar,
I followed him and his family.

01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:50.267
And he wasn't as in control
of his vehicle as I was of mine,

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:52.870
and he, um...

01:20:52.904 --> 01:20:54.404
well, he flipped it.

01:20:54.438 --> 01:20:55.807
Flipped it on the, um...

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:58.275
one of the roads
outside of town.

01:20:58.308 --> 01:21:01.411
And Beaver, Beaver was there.
Beaver was going, "Fuck, fuck!"

01:21:04.882 --> 01:21:06.416
And, um...

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.722
And there was this body there.

01:21:11.756 --> 01:21:14.491
There was a body had just,
you know,

01:21:14.524 --> 01:21:18.595
been thrown out of the car
and was just lying on the road.

01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:21.565
And Beaver was going, "We got to get
out of here. You're over the limit, Jim.

01:21:21.598 --> 01:21:23.300
You don't want to ruin
your life over this."

01:21:27.304 --> 01:21:28.672
Yeah, and we did.

01:21:39.683 --> 01:21:41.351
And, um...

01:21:43.888 --> 01:21:46.223
when I heard that...

01:21:46.256 --> 01:21:48.760
When I heard that
that little girl...

01:21:50.862 --> 01:21:52.696
When I heard that
that little girl

01:21:52.729 --> 01:21:54.631
could have lived if we'd, um...

01:21:58.803 --> 01:22:00.437
We drove away anyway.

01:23:06.536 --> 01:23:07.972
We've got some bad weather
on the way.

01:23:08.005 --> 01:23:09.272
Yeah, I seen.

01:23:50.714 --> 01:23:51.949
White Point?

01:23:51.983 --> 01:23:53.617
Shit. I know it.

01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:55.685
Had me head kicked in
at the pub when I was 19.

01:23:58.022 --> 01:23:59.891
You in fishing, then?

01:23:59.924 --> 01:24:01.458
Something like that.

01:24:02.994 --> 01:24:04.361
And now you're here.

01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:08.465
You know, for a couple of years,
pilots have been saying

01:24:08.498 --> 01:24:10.001
they've seen a black fella
up here.

01:24:10.034 --> 01:24:12.003
But those pilots like a story,

01:24:12.036 --> 01:24:14.337
and there must be 2,000 islands
out there,

01:24:14.371 --> 01:24:17.374
so there's no way of proving
he isn't out there somewhere.

01:24:17.407 --> 01:24:19.376
It is native land,
isn't it?

01:24:19.409 --> 01:24:21.779
Yeah, and you couldn't fill
a Japanese car

01:24:21.813 --> 01:24:24.048
with the amount of black fellas
still have the bush skills

01:24:24.081 --> 01:24:26.017
to survive in this wilderness.

01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:27.919
And of that carload,
most of them would be too old

01:24:27.952 --> 01:24:29.787
to walk or see anymore.

01:24:29.821 --> 01:24:30.955
What are you saying?

01:24:33.456 --> 01:24:34.992
I'm saying, you certain
you want to look?

01:24:35.026 --> 01:24:36.861
Could be his corpse we find.

01:25:44.929 --> 01:25:46.429
Do you want to dance?

01:25:50.034 --> 01:25:51.568
No.

01:25:57.074 --> 01:25:58.843
Where are we looking
tomorrow?

01:26:00.644 --> 01:26:02.980
Your guess is as good as mine,
Georgie.

01:28:19.316 --> 01:28:21.852
Well, we're done for the day.

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.922
One more.

01:28:24.955 --> 01:28:26.689
I want to find him too, Georgie.

01:28:26.723 --> 01:28:28.325
Your man promised me double
if I did.

01:28:28.359 --> 01:28:30.327
But that tide's
about to turn against us,

01:28:30.361 --> 01:28:32.029
and I'm not for dying
out here.

01:29:41.465 --> 01:29:42.867
Oh, shit.

01:29:44.268 --> 01:29:46.003
He's here.

01:29:46.036 --> 01:29:47.972
He doesn't want to be found.

01:29:49.406 --> 01:29:52.076
- He was here.
- Could have been an animal.

01:29:52.109 --> 01:29:53.043
Lu!

01:29:54.912 --> 01:29:56.080
Lu!

01:29:59.783 --> 01:30:01.118
I want to help you!

01:30:04.088 --> 01:30:05.688
Lu!

01:30:07.124 --> 01:30:08.859
Come back to me!

01:30:11.862 --> 01:30:13.063
Lu!

01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:22.173
Go to sleep, Bird.

01:30:22.206 --> 01:30:24.008
I don't want to sleep.

01:30:25.943 --> 01:30:27.710
Lu!

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:32.917
Shut your eyes and pretend
like normal kids do.

01:30:34.151 --> 01:30:35.286
Lu!

01:30:38.022 --> 01:30:40.324
Don't want to be normal.

01:30:45.129 --> 01:30:46.797
Lu!

01:30:58.909 --> 01:31:00.311
No sign of him.

01:31:09.053 --> 01:31:10.955
Bad news, I'm afraid.

01:31:10.988 --> 01:31:13.257
Pilot just radioed.

01:31:13.290 --> 01:31:16.760
Storm's coming in quicker
than they thought.

01:31:16.794 --> 01:31:19.363
It's going to develop
into a tropical cyclone.

01:31:19.396 --> 01:31:21.832
He wants to get us out tomorrow.

01:31:25.135 --> 01:31:27.338
- Just leave me here.
- Can't do that.

01:31:28.472 --> 01:31:29.940
Why?

01:31:31.875 --> 01:31:33.410
Because that'd be murder.

01:31:39.149 --> 01:31:41.285
What'll happen to him?

01:31:41.318 --> 01:31:44.188
I'm not going to lie to you,
Georgie.

01:31:46.257 --> 01:31:47.758
I don't want you to lie.

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.528
He'll die.

01:31:53.063 --> 01:31:54.365
