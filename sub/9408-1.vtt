00:33.944 --> 00:37.016
There was a time, long ago,

00:37.704 --> 00:39.774
when evil men with greed in their hearts

00:39.864 --> 00:45.097
would lay siege to the king that possessed
the ancient treasures of the Dark Ages.

00:47.264 --> 00:50.734
But the king was in league
with creatures of magic,

00:51.624 --> 00:53.421
forest spirits.

00:56.144 --> 00:57.862
Leprechauns,

00:57.944 --> 01:01.653
these guardians summoned from the earth
to protect the gold

01:01.784 --> 01:05.299
from falling into the hands of evil men,

01:06.904 --> 01:08.383
of wicked men.

01:09.984 --> 01:12.452
The legend of their ferocities
spread through the land

01:12.544 --> 01:16.253
and all would know not to trifle
with these creatures.

01:24.264 --> 01:26.903
The kings reign would come to an end,

01:28.344 --> 01:33.737
and the leprechauns would find their home
again back in Mother Natures embrace.

01:35.464 --> 01:37.978
Except for the myth of the one,

01:39.864 --> 01:42.332
the one that did not go back.

02:15.344 --> 02:18.222
No, no!

02:32.624 --> 02:35.263
Jacob!

03:14.064 --> 03:16.703
- Where is it?
- It's gone.

03:18.464 --> 03:22.980
You can't hide it from me, Jacob.
The rainbow always points to me treasure.

03:25.984 --> 03:31.012
Never again, foul creature.
You're going back to hell tonight,

03:31.104 --> 03:33.140
and the Lord will help me send you.

03:33.224 --> 03:39.982
Poor misguided Jacob, even if you steal
for God, you still have to pay the Devil.

03:44.784 --> 03:46.695
Damn clovers.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.214
The Lord is at my side.

04:02.784 --> 04:07.983
In the name of the Father, I condemn thee
to the valley in the shadow of death.

04:08.064 --> 04:09.895
I shall not fear your evil.

04:09.984 --> 04:13.101
Take it all, take it all!
Just don't send me back.

04:13.184 --> 04:17.063
I am sending you back to the earth,
back into the grave whence you came.

04:17.264 --> 04:21.779
I banish thee, spawn of Satan!

04:24.224 --> 04:29.014
No! Help me! Please!

04:29.784 --> 04:32.173
Help, help.

04:40.064 --> 04:44.182
I'm sorry. Sorry.

05:10.584 --> 05:12.256
They hiring at the salon?

05:12.664 --> 05:14.017
Fool, it's a women's salon.

05:14.104 --> 05:15.617
What do you think
you're gonna do up in there?

05:15.704 --> 05:19.060
I can give massages.
I can help with those bikini waxes.

05:19.144 --> 05:21.180
- Bikini wax?
- Yeah, you know what I'm saying.

05:21.264 --> 05:22.413
A little Mohawk, a little triangle.

05:22.504 --> 05:25.223
I'm the fucking bomb
with that shit, for real.

05:26.504 --> 05:27.903
- Shut up!
- Yeah.

05:29.104 --> 05:31.572
They got everybody's hopes up
for no reason.

05:32.184 --> 05:34.334
Yeah, they broke as a motherfucker now.

05:34.424 --> 05:36.574
Anyone ever figure out
what happened to the money?

05:36.664 --> 05:41.658
No. It vanished.
I guess the project died with Father Jacob.

05:42.104 --> 05:45.301
Damn! How come every time something
good is about to happen

05:45.384 --> 05:47.773
somebody always gotta go and fuck it up?

05:50.224 --> 05:52.533
She looks fine as hell.

05:53.304 --> 05:55.613
- Girl! Hey!
- Girl what?

06:28.184 --> 06:29.299
Come here.

06:29.984 --> 06:32.214
Yeah, you, punk.

06:35.224 --> 06:38.182
- What's up, Watson?
- Don't Watson me, motherfucker!

06:41.304 --> 06:44.296
What the fuck is this shit?
What the fuck is this shit?

06:44.384 --> 06:46.340
Well, that was a Christmas gift
from my mom.

06:46.424 --> 06:47.903
Shut up, punk. Turn this fool over.

06:47.984 --> 06:49.383
All right, wait, listen. Hold on.

06:49.464 --> 06:52.262
No. Why do you got to do this, man?

06:52.344 --> 06:55.780
Watson! Listen... Come on, man!

06:56.544 --> 06:58.102
What the fuck is this?

07:00.784 --> 07:02.775
You need something, punk?

07:04.504 --> 07:06.540
I didn't think so, motherfucker.

07:07.704 --> 07:09.581
You better have my shit
by the end of this week.

07:09.664 --> 07:11.063
You understand me, motherfucker?

07:11.144 --> 07:13.339
And give me these motherfucking shoes.

07:14.024 --> 07:15.901
End of the week, punk.

07:39.224 --> 07:41.897
Hey, girl, what you gonna do
with all that cash?

07:41.984 --> 07:44.578
I'm saving up for college.
I want to go to Kansas State.

07:44.664 --> 07:47.132
What you gonna do with
your ashy ass in Kansas?

07:47.224 --> 07:49.055
Ain't no black people in that motherfucker.

07:49.144 --> 07:51.704
Girl!
She's going somewhere over the rainbow.

07:55.224 --> 07:58.341
- Excuse you, grandma!
- That child is always tripping.

07:59.264 --> 08:01.255
Can I get some service up in here?

08:01.344 --> 08:04.063
Will you be having work done
to your extensions?

08:04.944 --> 08:08.459
First of all, this ain't no nappy-ass weave.

08:09.224 --> 08:11.294
Go ahead, feel it. Feel it.

08:11.984 --> 08:15.863
Right, so like I said,
can I get some service up in here?

08:19.024 --> 08:20.582
Hurry up!

08:23.704 --> 08:26.457
Girl, this ain't what I wanted.
See, I knew I should've had Yolanda cut it.

08:26.544 --> 08:27.533
Oh, no. I can just...

08:27.624 --> 08:30.138
Let me trim a little off the edges.
I need to layer it in the back anyway.

08:30.224 --> 08:32.340
This don't look like no Julia Roberts.

08:32.424 --> 08:36.815
- I look like Raggedy fucking Ann. Yolanda!
- Emily, come here.

08:36.904 --> 08:40.214
I'm sorry. She kept changing her mind.
She said she wanted long and curly.

08:40.304 --> 08:41.373
Don't back talk, girl.

08:41.464 --> 08:44.058
We got customers waiting,
and if you can't cut heads faster than this,

08:44.144 --> 08:46.658
you gonna get your dumb ass replaced.

08:49.424 --> 08:51.858
...good on this motherfucker, man.
- Wallet!

08:53.664 --> 08:55.620
All through the 'hood, son.

08:57.624 --> 09:01.173
- Where you off to, Jackson?
- Nowhere.

09:02.864 --> 09:04.934
Punk ass nigger, drinking Kool-Aid.

09:05.744 --> 09:07.382
It's Powerade, you illiterate motherfucker.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.978
That's why you don't drop out of school
before you learn how to read.

09:10.064 --> 09:12.453
- Motherfucker, I'll beat your...
- Cedric.

09:15.024 --> 09:17.413
Doing good for yourself, little brother.

09:17.704 --> 09:21.458
You only on the streets a few months
and already you're a big spender.

09:21.544 --> 09:23.899
- Just making ends meet, man.
- Yeah.

09:23.984 --> 09:28.216
Only problem that you're making is
you're not a part of this, motherfucker.

09:30.784 --> 09:32.775
I don't want to fight you, Watson.

09:35.184 --> 09:37.095
We understand each other.

09:43.944 --> 09:45.343
My brother.

09:51.184 --> 09:53.698
Punk ass motherfucker. What, nigger?

09:58.784 --> 10:00.740
Yeah. Get the fuck out of here.

10:05.504 --> 10:07.017
He shook like a motherfucker.

10:07.104 --> 10:10.062
"Watson, I don't wanna fight with you."
Bitch-ass, nigger.

10:10.144 --> 10:13.216
Watson, man, you had the nigger's heart
going like this, son.

10:13.984 --> 10:16.544
You should have let me pop
that motherfucker.

10:21.944 --> 10:24.617
- Kill that motherfucker!
- Fuck.

10:24.704 --> 10:25.693
You all right?

10:33.264 --> 10:35.494
Hey, you want to go out Friday?

10:37.504 --> 10:38.539
No.

10:39.024 --> 10:40.503
What, you got plans?

10:41.104 --> 10:42.662
No, I ain't got no plans.

10:42.744 --> 10:46.453
- What's up then? When we gonna hang out?
- We ain't gonna hang out.

10:46.624 --> 10:49.661
Besides, what will we do, anyway,
if we went on a date?

10:50.584 --> 10:52.017
See, look, first of all,

10:52.104 --> 10:54.140
we'd go somewhere real nice.
You know what I'm saying?

10:54.224 --> 10:57.614
Then we'd drive to the beach.
You know what I mean? Lay out a blanket.

10:57.704 --> 10:59.854
You could have one of them
tight ass bikinis on,

10:59.944 --> 11:01.616
then all the dudes'll be staring, like,

11:01.704 --> 11:05.697
"Damn, she is fine!" But the thing is,
you with me so they will suffer.

11:08.384 --> 11:09.976
That sounds good.

11:10.664 --> 11:11.938
For real?

11:12.624 --> 11:14.262
Except for a few things.

11:14.384 --> 11:17.501
One, you ain't got no car to drive us in.

11:17.704 --> 11:22.141
Two, you ain't got no money,
and three, you ain't got me.

11:24.424 --> 11:26.221
What about Saturday?

11:29.304 --> 11:30.942
No? Sunday?

11:31.544 --> 11:32.693
Well, how about dentistry?

11:32.784 --> 11:37.858
Girl, I do not want to be sticking my hands
down people's nasty ass mouths all day.

11:48.664 --> 11:49.983
Oh, my God.

11:54.584 --> 11:57.462
Looks like we're gonna be
taking the bus to school.

11:59.864 --> 12:02.014
Come on, it's just a car.

12:04.704 --> 12:06.934
When's it gonna get better for us, Em?

12:07.624 --> 12:09.899
Why our lives got to be like this?

12:11.024 --> 12:13.413
We just got the bad end of things right now.

12:14.304 --> 12:16.135
But it's going to get better.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.134
- Promise?
- Promise.

12:22.744 --> 12:24.700
Besides, you don't want
that old beat-up car.

12:24.784 --> 12:27.935
- You're too cute for that car.
- I know, huh?

12:29.264 --> 12:30.743
Come on.

12:37.144 --> 12:40.181
- I thought you were saving your money up.
- You coming or what?

12:40.264 --> 12:43.222
This building should've fell down yesterday.
I'm not going in there.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.693
Well, if you're scared, okay.

12:47.584 --> 12:48.778
I'm not scared.

12:55.264 --> 12:56.333
Hi!

13:00.544 --> 13:02.614
Good to see you again, Erica.

13:04.424 --> 13:07.655
- It's Emily.
- Close enough.

13:07.744 --> 13:09.974
What are you laughing at, Lisa?

13:13.264 --> 13:14.902
How do you know my name?

13:15.184 --> 13:20.053
Come, sit. All will be revealed.

13:30.744 --> 13:32.177
I see peril coming.

13:32.864 --> 13:34.377
Danger awaits you.

13:34.784 --> 13:35.978
Rory?

13:36.264 --> 13:38.141
- Is that why we came here?
- Hush, Linda.

13:38.224 --> 13:41.182
- Lisa.
- You suffered a great loss,

13:41.424 --> 13:43.813
like so many other times in your life.

13:44.704 --> 13:49.255
It began with the loss of your parents,
and it has come to this.

13:50.744 --> 13:56.421
The nest egg you have created is gone,
along with the bird that stole it.

14:00.304 --> 14:02.499
I see wealth in your future.

14:03.144 --> 14:05.419
You'll come into it very soon.

14:06.064 --> 14:07.622
Oh, child!

14:07.704 --> 14:10.662
I speak of riches
beyond your wildest dreams.

14:11.624 --> 14:13.103
It sounds good.

14:13.184 --> 14:16.654
But it must be denied,
for it will come at a high price.

14:16.744 --> 14:20.100
- Wait. Wait. Why it got to be denied?
- At what price?

14:20.184 --> 14:25.417
The very fabric of your essence
will be torn apart. It must be denied.

14:26.024 --> 14:28.936
Heed my words, Erica and Linda.

14:32.304 --> 14:36.900
An evil so dark will come to reclaim it.

14:54.304 --> 14:55.942
Does that always happen?

15:03.264 --> 15:05.539
This that good shit, dog.

15:06.104 --> 15:08.095
Rory don't play.

15:13.024 --> 15:15.140
Yeah, you know you want some of this, dog.

15:15.224 --> 15:19.103
No, no, you can't have none. This is my bud.

15:19.224 --> 15:22.136
And if you want your own,
you better go out and get a job.

15:22.224 --> 15:24.943
Get paid and then you get
to buy your own shit.

15:31.544 --> 15:34.138
What the fuck is this?

15:34.704 --> 15:38.936
Oh, Rory got some fucked up agriculture
going on up in this motherfucker.

15:39.224 --> 15:42.182
Boy, you talking to my dog again?

15:42.784 --> 15:45.298
Just the man I was looking for.

15:45.424 --> 15:47.221
Man, I'm gonna tell you right now,

15:47.304 --> 15:49.943
there ain't no clovers in my bud, all right?
So chill with that shit.

15:50.024 --> 15:54.142
Man, it was filled with the motherfuckers.
Satisfaction guaranteed.

15:54.224 --> 15:57.261
- And I ain't no satisfied customer, yo.
- Satisfied customer?

15:57.344 --> 15:58.618
Do I look like a Kmart?

15:58.704 --> 16:01.616
Man, I know my rights,
and that shit wasn't right.

16:02.584 --> 16:03.699
All right. Where are the clovers?

16:03.784 --> 16:06.423
See, I knew you was gonna say that,
and that's why I brought these bitches.

16:06.504 --> 16:07.903
You know what I'm saying?
They're right here.

16:07.984 --> 16:10.293
A real bag of motherfucking Lucky Charms.

16:12.864 --> 16:15.094
Man, I must have left
the motherfuckers at the crib.

16:16.024 --> 16:17.173
Left them at the crib?

16:17.264 --> 16:19.903
Well, check this out, next time make sure
you bring 'em with your sorry ass,

16:19.984 --> 16:22.782
'cause no proof, no motherfucking refund.
All right?

16:22.864 --> 16:24.138
All right, man. Damn.

16:24.224 --> 16:27.261
You ain't got to get all over my shit.
I'll bring them. You'll see.

16:27.344 --> 16:30.063
- Filled with clovers, ninja.
- Ninja?

16:30.144 --> 16:33.693
- Nigger, did you just call me a ninja?
- Hey, man, hey.

16:33.824 --> 16:36.975
You need to get out more, man.
Don't nobody say nigger no more.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.180
Yeah. Like, "What up, ninja?"

16:40.064 --> 16:41.292
"Look at them ninja's over there."

16:41.384 --> 16:44.421
You need to stop smoking that shit,
you dumbass nigger.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.698
Ninja, please.

16:47.744 --> 16:49.974
- Who's the mafia guy?
- Hey, homie.

16:50.064 --> 16:53.420
Shut the fuck up, man, or leave.
This is business. All right?

16:53.864 --> 16:55.502
What's up, Marcos?

16:56.744 --> 16:59.895
- Got something for you here.
- Got something for you.

17:01.424 --> 17:03.540
I'm gonna be needing some more
in about a week.

17:03.624 --> 17:05.773
My clients love this shit.

17:05.864 --> 17:08.742
I swear I sell more because of this chronic.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.574
All right, man, just make sure
you hit me up before you do. All right?

17:13.664 --> 17:15.301
I'm sorry, "hit you up"?

17:15.944 --> 17:19.414
- Call me.
- All right. My nigger.

17:20.503 --> 17:21.539
What?

17:21.624 --> 17:24.661
Man, who you calling nigger, nigger?

17:25.424 --> 17:28.063
- I thought we were cool...
- No one says that any more, all right?

17:28.144 --> 17:30.658
- It's ninja. My ninja.
- Yeah.

17:30.744 --> 17:31.733
Okay.

17:32.864 --> 17:35.253
- My ninja.
- My ninja.

17:36.064 --> 17:40.421
My bad, fellows. Play on, players.
You look good. That guy looks good.

17:40.504 --> 17:44.292
Baby Jordan over there. Okay.
I'll look for you in the pros.

17:44.584 --> 17:45.812
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

17:45.904 --> 17:47.462
Somebody got his ass kicked
coming out here.

17:47.544 --> 17:50.344
No matter, man. It's all green,
you know what I'm saying?

17:51.104 --> 17:53.254
Why we couldn't do this at the park,
like normal people?

17:53.344 --> 17:55.460
What park? You see any parks around here?

17:55.544 --> 17:57.023
How about the beach?

17:57.144 --> 18:00.181
Now, why you want to go to the beach
when we got all of this right here?

18:00.264 --> 18:02.255
'Cause I need to work on my tan.

18:02.904 --> 18:05.179
- Girl, you're a mess.
- Yeah, that's right.

18:05.264 --> 18:08.540
All my hoes be cooking.
Where my dinner at?

18:09.344 --> 18:10.743
You are so ghetto.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.299
Hey, daddy's home.

18:14.864 --> 18:15.899
Yeah.

18:17.424 --> 18:18.698
How could you afford this?

18:18.784 --> 18:21.173
Well, I had a little help.

18:22.824 --> 18:25.179
Jamie, I'm gonna kill you.

18:25.264 --> 18:27.937
What? I had no money for the food,
and I asked him would he float me.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.059
He said, "No".

18:29.144 --> 18:31.533
Then he asked me what for,
and I told him we was having a barbecue

18:31.624 --> 18:35.060
and that you was going to be here, and
that's when he bought all this extra shit.

18:35.144 --> 18:36.133
Asshole.

18:36.304 --> 18:38.420
Look, he even bought wings
and some hot sauce.

18:38.504 --> 18:40.734
You know how much
I love my hot sauce, girl.

18:40.824 --> 18:42.701
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?

18:42.784 --> 18:44.979
- What up?
- Not much.

18:46.784 --> 18:48.137
What's up, Em?

18:51.544 --> 18:55.173
- You told her I was coming, right?
- Hell, yeah, man, she just shy.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.822
Here, have a 40.

19:30.624 --> 19:32.501
It's a shame they never finished this, huh?

19:32.584 --> 19:35.303
We ain't got nothing
to say to each other, Rory.

19:52.704 --> 19:54.854
I didn't choose this life for myself.

19:55.544 --> 19:57.978
Look, don't act all high and mighty.
I never asked you for anything.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.816
No, I was just dumb looking out for you.

19:59.904 --> 20:02.862
- I didn't want you to give up shit for me.
- Yeah, but I gave up everything.

20:02.944 --> 20:06.334
- And I tried to pay you back, right?
- With drug money.

20:06.424 --> 20:10.178
You think I was going to take that, Rory?
Then you really are stupid.

20:20.624 --> 20:23.297
Oh, shit. Are you all right?

20:23.504 --> 20:25.813
Yeah, get me out of here.

20:25.984 --> 20:28.578
- Here take this. Okay.
- Okay.

20:28.744 --> 20:30.814
I'll be right back with some rope.

22:34.504 --> 22:37.814
Emily! Emily!

22:41.704 --> 22:43.501
Emily!

22:55.904 --> 22:59.977
- Yo, you scared the piss out of me.
- You don't have to worry about me.

23:00.064 --> 23:03.340
- You're welcome. What's that?
- I don't know.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.574
- Let's see what's in it.
- Wait a minute.

23:09.584 --> 23:11.654
Holy shit.

23:15.824 --> 23:19.294
- How much do you think they're worth?
- Weigh about eight ounces.

23:19.704 --> 23:22.502
I say about four or five K apiece,
maybe more if they're old.

23:22.584 --> 23:24.461
You would know the weight.

23:25.024 --> 23:27.743
That's like 200 coins,
that's a million dollars.

23:27.984 --> 23:30.179
- That's 50 coins each.
- Nice.

23:30.624 --> 23:32.580
What are you talking about?

23:32.904 --> 23:36.294
- Sounds fair to me, baby.
- Of course it does to you. She found it.

23:36.384 --> 23:38.534
- Fuck you.
- Yeah.

23:38.784 --> 23:42.857
Hey, there's more than enough.
We can all benefit from this.

23:43.584 --> 23:48.453
Lisa, I want you to take some of this money
and buy yourself a new car,

23:48.544 --> 23:51.342
so you don't have
to take the bus to school. Okay?

23:52.744 --> 23:53.859
And...

23:54.344 --> 23:55.379
Rory.

23:56.584 --> 23:58.654
I want you to do the right thing.

24:02.744 --> 24:05.577
- Jamie.
- Yeah, what's up, baby?

24:05.664 --> 24:08.178
You cannot use the gold to buy bud.

24:08.784 --> 24:11.014
- What?
- No bud.

24:11.104 --> 24:13.095
- Damn!
- You heard me.

24:13.184 --> 24:15.300
What you laughing at? It ain't funny. Shit.

24:15.384 --> 24:17.340
We're in the money!

24:18.344 --> 24:20.812
All right. All right. Yeah, baby.

27:44.224 --> 27:46.021
Welcome to my lair!

27:48.784 --> 27:50.775
You have it, right here. Your medicine.

27:51.744 --> 27:55.100
Hey, look at this, this is my first one.
I got it when I was in the fourth grade.

27:55.184 --> 27:58.176
- Damn, fourth grade?
- Fourth grade. Yeah, for real.

27:58.264 --> 27:59.902
- That explains a lot.
- Yeah.

27:59.984 --> 28:02.544
- That's bad, though. I'm liking that.
- My motherfucker, right here. Okay.

28:02.624 --> 28:05.058
- What about this?
- Man, I can't even touch that.

28:05.144 --> 28:06.543
Yeah, you can touch it.
You just gotta stroke it.

28:06.624 --> 28:09.934
Stroke it right. She likes to be stroked.
You know what I'm saying?

28:10.024 --> 28:11.821
Yes, that will put you on your ass.

28:11.904 --> 28:14.464
- I need to get it out right now.
- Yeah.

28:14.544 --> 28:15.943
Oh, man.

28:16.744 --> 28:19.053
- Hey, my baby.
- What's up, baby?

28:19.144 --> 28:20.338
Y'all fucking?

28:20.424 --> 28:22.813
- Hey, you know how we do it, baby.
- Hey, you do your thing, man.

28:22.904 --> 28:25.020
You don't mind if I sit back
and run one of these, right?

28:25.104 --> 28:27.982
Oh, no, it's all good, man.
Hey, my shit is your shit, baby.

28:29.304 --> 28:32.023
Man, we need more black people
like you, man.

28:50.184 --> 28:51.503
What's up, girl?

28:53.504 --> 28:56.098
He did not just walk up in here
with that skeeze.

29:22.504 --> 29:25.223
Oh, this is some good shit.

29:25.864 --> 29:27.820
Oh, no.

29:28.504 --> 29:31.223
What's up, little man?
How you living, dawg?

29:34.064 --> 29:36.976
- You want a hit, man? You want a hit?
- Yeah.

29:37.064 --> 29:39.703
I haven't smoked a good pipe in a long time.

29:40.664 --> 29:44.339
Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.
Now let go. Let go. Yeah.

29:44.424 --> 29:47.222
- Yeah. You like that, huh?
- That's good shit.

29:47.304 --> 29:49.772
Good shit, nigger.
It comes straight from Korea.

29:49.864 --> 29:53.220
I mean, this ain't gonna stunt
your growth or anything, is it?

30:03.224 --> 30:05.021
Yeah, you my nigger, man.

30:05.104 --> 30:07.379
I like you, dude. I like you a lot, man.

30:07.464 --> 30:09.375
You know what I'm saying?
I'm gonna get you smoking up.

30:09.464 --> 30:11.773
I'll get you some more, dude. I can manage.

30:11.864 --> 30:13.775
Don't be stingy with my shit, though.

30:19.664 --> 30:22.053
I swear, man, you cool.

30:22.144 --> 30:23.782
Oh, man.

30:27.504 --> 30:28.778
Where did you get that?

30:28.864 --> 30:31.424
Hey, man, you don't need
to worry about that, little man.

30:31.504 --> 30:34.018
We just here to smoke, all right? You know.

30:34.624 --> 30:38.697
That's me gold. Now give it back.
There's a good boy.

30:38.784 --> 30:42.936
What? I'm gonna get you high and you have
the nerve to ask me for my money, man.

30:43.024 --> 30:46.699
Man, fuck you. You don't get it, man.
Fuck you. All right? I'll hit a midget, man.

30:46.784 --> 30:49.457
I mean, get the fuck out of here,
you hallucinating motherfucker.

30:49.544 --> 30:51.899
What? What, you gonna get in my face?

30:51.984 --> 30:53.940
Man, give me my bong back, bitch.

30:58.264 --> 30:59.413
Damn.

31:00.424 --> 31:01.698
Oh, man.

31:04.224 --> 31:05.737
Thanks for the smoke.

31:54.424 --> 31:55.777
Yeah.

31:57.824 --> 32:00.019
Man, who the fuck just took my shit?

32:00.104 --> 32:01.378
Man, you niggers is crazy.

32:01.464 --> 32:04.058
Can't a motherfucker enjoy
a smoke in his own goddamn house

32:04.144 --> 32:07.056
without somebody stealing shit? Fuckers!

33:03.704 --> 33:05.501
You put that girl to shame.

33:09.504 --> 33:12.223
So you ain't got no beef
with nobody on the street, huh?

33:12.304 --> 33:14.420
You think this might have been
Watson's gang?

33:14.504 --> 33:17.098
No, man, I told you I squared everything.

33:17.184 --> 33:19.778
What about all that ganja
you guys been smoking?

33:19.864 --> 33:22.253
Ganja? What ganja?

33:26.144 --> 33:31.741
Oh, man. My mom's Italian.
She likes a lot of oregano with her lasagne.

33:34.824 --> 33:37.292
If you know anything,
now is the time to speak up.

33:37.384 --> 33:39.659
- Told you everything, man.
- We don't know anything else.

33:39.744 --> 33:41.735
- Don't bullshit me!
- Hold up, man.

33:41.824 --> 33:46.102
You've been making a lot of moves on
the street in the past couple of days, Rory.

33:46.184 --> 33:49.494
Something tells me you know
exactly what's going on.

33:49.744 --> 33:51.974
Hey, look, don't trip. We gonna get you out.

33:52.064 --> 33:54.532
Man, I can't be nobody's prison bitch.
Don't leave me in there.

33:54.624 --> 33:57.980
I know what they do.
I can't be tossing nobody's salad.

34:00.664 --> 34:02.939
Knock it off. Knock it off.

34:06.544 --> 34:09.183
Yo, don't worry, man.
We're coming to get you.

34:09.623 --> 34:11.659
It's gonna be okay, Jamie.

34:18.543 --> 34:20.181
It's real.

34:22.103 --> 34:24.857
Can we speed this up, please? Thank you.

34:30.664 --> 34:32.734
How long this gonna take?

34:59.384 --> 35:00.578
So fly!

35:06.544 --> 35:08.455
Yeah, I'm gonna look good.

35:18.104 --> 35:19.901
You see that shit, man?

35:20.264 --> 35:22.858
Man, that's a big fucking account
he just took from us, man.

35:22.944 --> 35:24.059
I mean, fuck this shit.

35:24.144 --> 35:26.021
I say we go ice this motherfucker
right fucking now.

35:26.104 --> 35:27.093
No, no, no.

35:27.184 --> 35:29.493
- Why not?
- He deserves better than that.

35:29.784 --> 35:31.422
What the fuck you talking about?

35:31.504 --> 35:33.301
We're gonna do this right.

35:33.864 --> 35:36.059
It's gonna be loud and messy.

35:36.544 --> 35:40.093
I'm gonna make his ass a cautionary tale
for the rest of the fucking hood.

35:40.184 --> 35:41.458
Hell, yeah.

35:43.664 --> 35:45.734
It don't pay to be a nice guy.

35:50.544 --> 35:51.613
Hurry up.

35:51.704 --> 35:54.298
This is my last day.
You can't do me like this.

35:54.384 --> 35:55.453
What?

35:55.544 --> 35:57.102
You are still on my clock. Got it?

35:57.184 --> 35:59.493
It's gonna take me three hours
to rub her down.

35:59.584 --> 36:01.256
- I'm out of here.
- What?

36:01.664 --> 36:04.701
Girl, you better get in there
and rub her down and leave her satisfied.

36:04.784 --> 36:06.536
Now I want you to remember
I kept your ass employed

36:06.624 --> 36:08.296
through all your bullshit with Rory,

36:08.384 --> 36:12.297
when you would float your ass in here
and do nothing for an entire month.

36:12.704 --> 36:16.617
Now I have no idea what kind
of crazy bullshit that you're mixed up in,

36:16.704 --> 36:18.183
but I don't like it.

36:18.664 --> 36:21.337
The Emily I remember always kept her word.

36:22.024 --> 36:23.935
That is the shit.

36:26.264 --> 36:28.459
Don't I need some more of that, honey.

36:29.784 --> 36:31.103
I need more oil.

36:31.584 --> 36:33.893
How much they put in them small bottles?

36:34.064 --> 36:36.783
- They don't come in beached-whale size.
- What?

36:37.024 --> 36:39.333
Nothing. I need some more oil.

36:40.864 --> 36:42.695
Get that Caribbean coconut.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.456
That shit is the bomb.

36:56.224 --> 37:00.217
Hurry up!
Come start rubbing me before I cool down!

37:20.464 --> 37:22.136
Oh, God.

37:24.184 --> 37:27.813
This is wonderful. Work it, baby. Work it!

37:43.264 --> 37:46.381
Oh, you got magic in those little hands.

37:46.664 --> 37:49.736
Yeah, I've always had a way with the ladies.

38:08.264 --> 38:09.253
Where's me gold?

38:43.824 --> 38:45.052
Me eye.

38:50.024 --> 38:52.982
Irish eyes will soon be smilin' again.

38:56.104 --> 38:58.413
Rory! We can't spend any more money.

38:58.504 --> 39:00.779
It's a leprechaun and he's after us.
He wants his gold back.

39:00.864 --> 39:03.139
He's the one who killed that guy,
that guy at the party.

39:03.224 --> 39:04.452
What the hell are you talking about?

39:04.544 --> 39:05.977
Are you smoking Jamie's stash
or some shit?

39:06.064 --> 39:10.535
Girl, you need to calm down, acting all crazy
talking about leprechauns and shit.

39:12.824 --> 39:14.815
What's up, y'all?

39:16.064 --> 39:18.783
We have to get Lisa. Come on.
Come on, we have to go.

39:18.864 --> 39:20.456
Get in the car. Get in the car.
Come on, we have to go.

39:20.544 --> 39:21.579
I just got here.

39:21.664 --> 39:23.734
Just head home and I'll call you
when it's over with. All right?

39:23.824 --> 39:25.257
This doesn't concern you, all right?

39:25.344 --> 39:28.256
Here, take this. Okay?

40:53.784 --> 40:54.773
What...

40:57.664 --> 40:58.653
What...

41:18.544 --> 41:20.262
Come on, Em.

42:21.184 --> 42:25.143
Into the bath, my pretty.
I like my girls nice and clean.

42:25.424 --> 42:27.779
Die, you little motherfucker!

42:53.424 --> 42:56.336
Come on. Come on.

42:59.504 --> 43:00.493
9-1-1...

43:51.664 --> 43:53.894
I can't believe she's gone.

43:59.984 --> 44:02.737
I'm sorry, Em.
I know how much she meant to you.

44:05.584 --> 44:06.858
Did you?

44:11.344 --> 44:14.256
- All right, so what's next, y'all?
- We return the gold.

44:14.344 --> 44:17.381
No. Hell, no. There's gotta be another way.
Fuck that.

44:17.464 --> 44:21.776
We return the gold and everything that's left
and maybe all this stuff will stop.

44:24.304 --> 44:25.817
Everybody ante up.

44:35.904 --> 44:39.453
- Hey, easy come, easy go.
- We're fucked.

44:39.984 --> 44:43.260
You done it again.
How could you spend all of it?

44:44.824 --> 44:47.384
What the fuck is wrong with you, woman?

44:49.784 --> 44:51.536
Oh, shit.

44:55.704 --> 44:57.535
This shit is heavy as hell.

45:08.944 --> 45:10.423
Impossible.

45:26.744 --> 45:28.223
Shit.

45:28.664 --> 45:30.222
What you waiting for?

45:40.104 --> 45:42.299
Yo, why you bullshitting?

45:42.384 --> 45:44.659
I say we jump in
the motherfucking '64 outside,

45:44.744 --> 45:46.860
and haul ass
and don't stop till we get to Mexico.

45:46.944 --> 45:48.423
You in it, partner?

45:53.864 --> 45:56.901
We are not spending any more gold.
We're giving it up.

45:58.104 --> 46:00.060
That's a fucking shame.

46:11.784 --> 46:16.016
- I can't believe you left this up.
- It was only four months ago.

46:18.344 --> 46:21.734
It was a lifetime ago. You're right, Em.

46:22.064 --> 46:27.138
We gotta give back that gold.
It's your only play.

46:42.624 --> 46:47.095
- You found it. I knew you would.
- What is it?

46:47.184 --> 46:48.697
None of you are safe.

46:48.784 --> 46:52.254
The accursed one
will not stop until he gets it back.

46:52.344 --> 46:54.221
What are you talking about?

47:04.144 --> 47:05.463
Where's Rory?

47:05.824 --> 47:07.735
He said he had to get something
from his bike.

47:07.824 --> 47:09.860
Where's the gold?

47:10.584 --> 47:12.063
Oh, shit!

47:22.424 --> 47:23.413
Shit.

47:55.504 --> 47:59.099
- Come to bed, my sweet.
- I don't have your gold.

47:59.184 --> 48:02.142
I know that. I'm not here for me gold.

48:02.224 --> 48:06.058
- I'll catch that thief soon enough.
- What do you want?

48:08.584 --> 48:11.781
Revenge. An eye for an eye.

49:04.464 --> 49:07.536
Come on, baby. Come on.

49:39.624 --> 49:43.060
Rory, where the hell you run off to?
You better call me back.

49:43.144 --> 49:45.863
I'm not playing with you. Call me back.

49:47.224 --> 49:48.418
Fuck.

49:52.264 --> 49:53.822
Hello, there.

49:53.984 --> 49:56.498
How the fuck you get in here,
you crazy-looking motherfucker?

49:56.584 --> 49:59.735
That gold didn't even belong
to the one you stole it from.

49:59.824 --> 50:03.134
Listen, don't hurt me.
I ain't have nothing to do with this.

50:13.984 --> 50:15.542
Leprechaun.

50:16.824 --> 50:20.294
Goddamn crackers,
always breaking into niggers' houses.

50:33.784 --> 50:37.094
You have such a nice smile. Say, "Ah."

50:54.264 --> 50:57.734
Pull over right now.
Rory, come on, pull over.

50:59.944 --> 51:01.377
What?

51:04.624 --> 51:07.138
Yo, Emily, we don't have time for this shit.

51:11.664 --> 51:13.097
Why should I trust you?

51:13.184 --> 51:16.256
Everybody was right about you.
You are no good.

51:16.784 --> 51:20.493
You're right. I ain't no good.

51:22.424 --> 51:26.133
But I'm trying, Em.
I'm trying to do the right thing.

51:39.704 --> 51:42.457
Hit it. Take the alley and cut him off.

52:01.024 --> 52:03.299
- Where you going in such a hurry, boy?
- We're being followed.

52:03.384 --> 52:05.261
- You shut your trap.
- What you got in that box?

52:05.344 --> 52:06.379
Nothing.

52:06.464 --> 52:09.376
It's my dirty laundry.
Just give us a ticket and let us go.

52:09.464 --> 52:10.943
Hey, hey!

52:12.024 --> 52:13.616
- Here.
- Let her go!

52:45.144 --> 52:48.295
What the fuck are you?
A little early for Halloween, ain't we?

52:48.384 --> 52:51.182
- They have me gold.
- Oh, it's your gold.

52:51.264 --> 52:54.461
Of course, you're a leprechaun.
So we'll just hand it over to you.

52:54.544 --> 52:57.695
- I'd appreciate it.
- Why don't you go home to your mama?

52:59.184 --> 53:01.459
What did you say about me mother?

53:10.264 --> 53:12.095
You want some more?

53:33.104 --> 53:34.139
Come on!

53:59.384 --> 54:02.296
Give that back.

54:09.224 --> 54:10.339
Shit.

54:43.064 --> 54:44.053
Come on.

55:02.384 --> 55:05.660
Watch out, kiddies.
Revenge will be mine tonight.

55:11.544 --> 55:13.341
Oh, bloody hell.

55:17.264 --> 55:18.697
Jamie.

55:20.824 --> 55:24.976
We don't want none. Man, damn.

55:25.384 --> 55:26.942
Hold on.

55:32.064 --> 55:34.020
What's up, y'all?
Y'all want some smoke smoke?

55:34.104 --> 55:36.254
- We got to get rid of this gold, right now.
- We have to go.

55:36.344 --> 55:38.300
- Why?
- We are being chased by a leprechaun.

55:38.384 --> 55:41.103
- Yo, come on.
- Man, you can't be smoking your own shit.

55:41.184 --> 55:43.015
That's the first thing they teach you, ninja.

55:43.104 --> 55:45.777
- Ninja?
- Don't ask. Come on, man, let's go.

55:56.384 --> 55:57.703
Hey, big spender.

55:57.904 --> 56:01.180
How's the business treating you?
What the fuck you got here?

56:01.904 --> 56:03.542
Oh, shit.

56:05.504 --> 56:08.655
Oh, fuck. You slick motherfucker.

56:09.424 --> 56:11.938
No wonder you be acting
like a fucking pimp.

56:15.544 --> 56:17.421
Yo, we cool, right? You got the gold.

56:17.504 --> 56:20.302
- No, motherfucker. We ain't cool.
- Shit.

56:23.344 --> 56:24.333
Police, nigger.

56:38.424 --> 56:40.813
Hell, man, that's nasty.

56:47.184 --> 56:48.697
What the fuck is that?

56:53.504 --> 56:57.702
- Yo, Watson, shoot that little freak
for real. - Shut the fuck up.

56:59.624 --> 57:02.855
Hello, lads,
I think you got something of mine.

57:03.344 --> 57:06.700
What the fuck you want?
You Lucky-Charm-looking motherfucker.

57:07.304 --> 57:10.023
You have stolen
what's been stolen from me.

57:10.104 --> 57:11.822
Hold on, hold on.

57:14.304 --> 57:15.783
- Yeah?
- Where the fuck are you?

57:15.864 --> 57:17.263
Hey, hey, baby, how you doing?

57:17.344 --> 57:20.859
- You think youre really slick...
- No, baby, I can't get into that right now.

57:20.944 --> 57:22.138
You with some skanky ho, aint you?

57:22.224 --> 57:25.899
No, baby, I ain't with nobody. Look,
I'm with you and only you, baby. Come on.

57:25.984 --> 57:32.139
I know, look, look, I can't. I got a problem,
a small motherfucking problem.

57:32.424 --> 57:36.258
- Look, why don't you call a brother back?
- Okay, love you.

57:37.704 --> 57:39.217
Me too, baby.

57:42.264 --> 57:44.698
Now, you were saying, little motherfucker?

57:45.984 --> 57:48.498
You have stolen
what's been stolen from me.

57:48.784 --> 57:52.982
Now, be a good lad. Give it back.

57:53.864 --> 57:58.699
Oh, the gold is yours?
Of course, a fucking leprechaun.

57:59.344 --> 58:03.257
- And you want the gold back?
- Aye.

58:03.584 --> 58:06.894
- Well, hold on. Let me get that for you.
- Yeah.

58:12.704 --> 58:16.617
Come on, motherfucker, get up. Come on.

58:25.104 --> 58:29.382
- You hit like a wee lass.
- Yeah? Okay, motherfucker.

58:29.624 --> 58:31.421
- Come on.
- Yeah.

58:33.984 --> 58:36.134
Who's the wee lass?
The weak lass, the motherfucker.

58:36.224 --> 58:39.660
We start this class, bitch.
Welcome to the hood, baby.

58:47.904 --> 58:50.054
Come on, man.
What's the fucking big deal, man?

58:56.784 --> 58:58.342
Getting tired, are we?

59:11.864 --> 59:13.092
Watson!

59:14.344 --> 59:15.857
Fuck you!

59:40.784 --> 59:42.661
Damn, Watson.

59:43.984 --> 59:45.542
Fuck, man!

59:49.344 --> 59:50.333
What the fuck?

59:51.584 --> 59:52.699
Who the fuck...

59:52.784 --> 59:55.582
- What's up, ninjas?
- What the fuck?

59:56.304 --> 59:57.942
Kill this motherfucker.

01:00:37.144 --> 01:00:38.543
Rory, jump in.

01:00:47.464 --> 01:00:49.614
- Let's get out of here.
- You said it.

01:00:51.464 --> 01:00:52.579
Yeah.

01:02:14.784 --> 01:02:16.934
- Hello?
- Who the fuck are you? Wheres Watson?

01:02:17.024 --> 01:02:18.503
Watson?

01:02:18.864 --> 01:02:21.458
- No. He's unavailable. Sorry.
- Are you one of his boys?

01:02:21.544 --> 01:02:23.899
You better not run with no skank.
What you look like?

01:02:23.984 --> 01:02:25.463
What do I look like?

01:02:25.584 --> 01:02:29.896
Well, I got red hair and a nice smile.

01:02:29.984 --> 01:02:32.259
- That sounds good.
- Yeah, and I'm a pretty sharp dresser.

01:02:32.344 --> 01:02:33.777
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:02:34.144 --> 01:02:38.899
- You work out? You got a good body?
- Yeah, I think I got a good body.

01:02:39.984 --> 01:02:42.578
- How tall are you, sweetie?
- How tall am I?

01:02:43.104 --> 01:02:47.256
- Well, about 3'6".
- 36!

01:02:47.344 --> 01:02:52.372
Yeah. But I make up for it in other areas,
if you know what I mean.

01:02:55.184 --> 01:02:58.256
Hello? Hello?

01:03:09.264 --> 01:03:10.697
Why we stopping?

01:03:12.584 --> 01:03:15.576
Man, it's all done. Oh, man.
There ain't nothing we can do, man.

01:03:15.664 --> 01:03:17.575
He's gonna fucking kill us all, man.

01:03:17.664 --> 01:03:19.222
Just like he tore apart Lisa.

01:03:19.304 --> 01:03:20.498
Just chill out, all right?

01:03:20.584 --> 01:03:23.018
This is your fault, man.
I ain't keeping quiet no more.

01:03:23.104 --> 01:03:25.413
- You better slow your fucking roll, you...
- Bitch, out of my face.

01:03:25.504 --> 01:03:28.064
Get out of your face? Nigger...

01:03:28.144 --> 01:03:29.179
You fucking crazy?

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:33.416
- Stop it! Stop! Stop it!
- Man, you said you weren't going hurt me!

01:03:33.544 --> 01:03:36.581
You said you were my friend, man.
You supposed to look out for me.

01:03:36.664 --> 01:03:39.815
It ain't my fault I'm scared, man.
Just don't hit me no more.

01:03:41.344 --> 01:03:43.175
- He started this shit!
- You started it!

01:03:43.264 --> 01:03:45.141
Both of you, shut the fuck up!

01:03:45.224 --> 01:03:47.897
That thing is gonna kill all of us
if we don't get our shit together.

01:03:47.984 --> 01:03:49.702
The only way
we can survive this is together.

01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:52.298
So stop acting like a bunch of mama's boys!

01:04:00.944 --> 01:04:02.423
My bad, man.

01:04:04.664 --> 01:04:06.222
Are we cool?

01:04:09.224 --> 01:04:10.976
Yeah, we cool, man.

01:04:20.064 --> 01:04:24.216
- So, what are we supposed to do now?
- No more running.

01:04:24.744 --> 01:04:26.814
So, we just sit here
and just wait for him to kill us?

01:04:26.904 --> 01:04:30.135
No. We gotta kill him first.

01:04:30.224 --> 01:04:32.692
How? Bullets don't do shit.

01:04:33.024 --> 01:04:35.379
Neither does getting squashed
by a two-ton car.

01:04:35.464 --> 01:04:37.898
- How do we kill it?
- I don't know.

01:04:38.704 --> 01:04:41.172
But I know just the person to ask.

01:04:50.144 --> 01:04:53.932
- We need to talk.
- What about my dead wife?

01:04:54.144 --> 01:04:55.736
She'll still be dead tomorrow, man.
Come on, let's go.

01:04:55.824 --> 01:04:57.974
- Get off me.
- Come on, man. Let's go.

01:04:58.264 --> 01:05:02.462
Did you heed my warning? Of course not.

01:05:02.544 --> 01:05:05.422
No one ever does once they have the gold.

01:05:05.624 --> 01:05:08.741
And now you have his wrath upon you.

01:05:08.824 --> 01:05:11.782
- How do we stop him?
- Why should I help you?

01:05:13.464 --> 01:05:15.534
How about that?

01:05:23.744 --> 01:05:30.297
These creatures, the Leg're Ghaun.
They are guardians from the Dark Ages.

01:05:31.184 --> 01:05:33.379
They were protectors of the king's fortune,

01:05:33.464 --> 01:05:37.252
born of earth magic,
and retrieve the king's gold

01:05:37.984 --> 01:05:40.214
and punish anyone who would steal it.

01:05:41.504 --> 01:05:43.779
But after the king died,

01:05:43.864 --> 01:05:47.937
they were all whisked away,
back into the earth. Except for one.

01:05:50.984 --> 01:05:54.499
He stayed in this mortal world
and became twisted and evil.

01:05:55.104 --> 01:05:57.493
How do we kill this little motherfucker?

01:05:57.944 --> 01:06:01.823
This creature's only weakness
are two things.

01:06:03.144 --> 01:06:06.500
His gold and the four-leaf clover.

01:06:08.544 --> 01:06:09.659
Four-leaf clover?

01:06:09.744 --> 01:06:13.339
Where the hell are we gonna get
a four-leaf clover in the hood?

01:06:16.424 --> 01:06:19.655
Yo, come on, man.
This ain't no time to be lighting up.

01:06:20.624 --> 01:06:22.854
Told you. Clovers.

01:06:25.624 --> 01:06:26.852
My ninja.

01:06:27.864 --> 01:06:30.332
How do we use this to kill the Leprechaun?

01:06:31.064 --> 01:06:35.023
- What about a crucifix?
- This creature predates Christianity.

01:06:35.104 --> 01:06:38.813
- What about garlic? Will that work?
- Lf he is hungry.

01:06:42.584 --> 01:06:45.052
That's it. A silver bullet.

01:06:45.144 --> 01:06:48.739
Man, why you even buy a Glock, man?
Those bitches always jam.

01:06:53.584 --> 01:06:55.222
Hollow tips.

01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:00.737
What you doing?

01:07:25.624 --> 01:07:27.899
Time to go fuck up some little people.

01:07:31.064 --> 01:07:32.736
Here you go.

01:07:33.824 --> 01:07:36.861
Man, how the fuck you get a gun
and all I get is a goddamn bat?

01:07:36.944 --> 01:07:38.093
What am I gonna do? Hit a homerun?

01:07:38.184 --> 01:07:40.823
Jamie, I just need you
to watch my back, man.

01:07:40.904 --> 01:07:43.259
Man, look,
all we gotta do is wait until the morning

01:07:43.344 --> 01:07:45.096
and the little fucker's toast.

01:07:45.184 --> 01:07:47.175
- Morning?
- Yeah. Sunlight and shit.

01:07:47.264 --> 01:07:49.016
He's not a vampire, you dumbass.

01:07:49.104 --> 01:07:52.176
Oh, look at you.
Look who's the expert on leprechauns now.

01:07:52.264 --> 01:07:54.255
How you know sunlight ain't gonna work?
You don't know.

01:07:54.344 --> 01:07:56.141
How come you think
you know everything all the time?

01:07:56.224 --> 01:07:59.739
All right, you hold right here.
I'm gonna go check on Em, all right?

01:08:00.064 --> 01:08:03.693
You better come back, too.
Leave me and this motherfucker by myself

01:08:04.144 --> 01:08:05.941
with a goddamn bat!

01:08:10.384 --> 01:08:11.863
Good luck, my child.

01:08:22.823 --> 01:08:24.814
I thought I had problems before.

01:08:25.104 --> 01:08:26.582
Baby, I'm...

01:08:27.504 --> 01:08:31.497
- I was just, you know...
- Yeah.

01:08:45.944 --> 01:08:47.662
Setting up a trap for me, boyo?

01:08:47.743 --> 01:08:50.053
Fuck you, you little mick motherfucker.

01:08:53.384 --> 01:08:55.375
Damned clover!

01:09:02.224 --> 01:09:03.737
Don't kill me.

01:09:04.184 --> 01:09:06.015
Take your gold. Take it all.

01:09:06.624 --> 01:09:08.103
Just spare me life.

01:09:09.384 --> 01:09:13.171
I'll never harm you again. I swear.

01:09:13.624 --> 01:09:17.697
You swear?
Say hello to Saint Patrick for me, bitch.

01:09:22.504 --> 01:09:23.857
It's jammed!

01:09:33.863 --> 01:09:35.661
Stay away from my friend!

01:09:37.104 --> 01:09:40.983
- You used me gold.
- That's right, bitch. I bought me a new car.

01:09:41.064 --> 01:09:45.501
I bought some ice, bought some new kicks
and an assload of bud, too.

01:09:45.584 --> 01:09:49.462
And I smoked that shit and it was good,
you motherfucker.

01:09:59.824 --> 01:10:02.133
I have no quarrel with you, witch.

01:10:02.224 --> 01:10:03.896
Well, that will have to change.

01:10:03.984 --> 01:10:07.613
Run, Emily.
I have an unwanted guest to deal with.

01:11:00.184 --> 01:11:02.618
You can't take the gold. You can't take it.

01:11:02.704 --> 01:11:04.820
It's mine. I want it back.

01:12:03.744 --> 01:12:04.859
No!

01:12:37.424 --> 01:12:40.063
You son of a bitch!

01:12:50.224 --> 01:12:51.418
Rory!

01:12:52.944 --> 01:12:55.139
Sorry, that hurt the old knee, did it?

01:12:55.224 --> 01:12:56.737
Fuck you up!

01:13:12.584 --> 01:13:14.575
This is what you want, isn't it?

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:19.497
No!

01:13:24.504 --> 01:13:25.983
My babies!

01:13:27.664 --> 01:13:29.063
Come and get them.

01:13:42.784 --> 01:13:45.457
No escaping from you this time, darling.

01:13:45.544 --> 01:13:48.775
You're going to hell
with all the others who stole from me.

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:04.015
No!

01:14:24.904 --> 01:14:26.895
I'll kill you!

01:14:41.024 --> 01:14:42.582
I like her.

01:15:08.184 --> 01:15:09.697
We've had our fun.

01:15:09.784 --> 01:15:13.777
Now give me what's mine,
and I might spare your miserable life.

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:17.222
Why did you kill them? For this?

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:21.582
- You evil fuck.
- Don't presume to tell me right from wrong.

01:15:21.704 --> 01:15:24.582
You compromised all you believed in
once you got the gold.

01:15:24.664 --> 01:15:28.543
Just like all those before you.
Your kind is weak

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:31.821
and will always give in
to your selfish yearnings.

01:15:34.104 --> 01:15:36.413
Brings out the worst in us, doesn't it?

01:15:38.344 --> 01:15:41.142
You really want to die so badly?

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:43.820
You can't live forever.

01:15:45.224 --> 01:15:46.498
No!

01:16:22.944 --> 01:16:25.139
I'm melting!

01:16:54.344 --> 01:16:55.743
Come on, Rory.

01:16:56.944 --> 01:16:58.457
Wake up.

01:17:00.064 --> 01:17:01.736
Wake up.

01:17:06.944 --> 01:17:11.176
- Where is he?
- He's dead.

01:17:13.824 --> 01:17:17.658
- It's all over.
- How did you get the gun to work?

01:17:18.104 --> 01:17:20.982
- Gun?
- The clovers.

01:17:26.384 --> 01:17:29.421
Nothing like a nice fire to warm the soul.

01:17:30.584 --> 01:17:32.017
Come on!

01:17:59.664 --> 01:18:04.021
For 2,000 years, you filthy mortals
have tried to steal my riches

01:18:04.104 --> 01:18:06.698
to satisfy your greedy urges.

01:18:07.784 --> 01:18:13.541
And it always ends the same,
with you begging for your miserable lives.

01:18:13.624 --> 01:18:16.422
- Rory!
- Fucking...

01:18:17.504 --> 01:18:18.857
I'm slipping!

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:21.378
Was it all worth it in the end?

01:18:26.224 --> 01:18:31.378
One day your kind will learn
that the treasures of the Leprechaun...

01:18:31.464 --> 01:18:32.453
Hey!

01:19:25.264 --> 01:19:30.054
All out of clovers, lad? That's too bad.

01:21:06.824 --> 01:21:08.974
Check out my ninja.
