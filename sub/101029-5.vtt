[reporter] Breaking news in the state
senate election for the 27th District.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.909
The New York Times
is reporting this morning

01:57.992 --> 02:00.120
what is being called "throuple-gate,"

02:00.578 --> 02:03.998
allegations that Dede Standish's
three-way marriage is a hoax...

02:04.082 --> 02:06.626
-What?
-...designed to court older, female voters

02:06.709 --> 02:08.545
and that Marcus Greeley, Dede's husband,

02:08.628 --> 02:12.423
is involved in a college cheating scandal,
authoring undergraduate papers

02:12.507 --> 02:14.467
in exchange for cash payment.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.385
For analysis...

02:15.468 --> 02:17.387
-[sighs heavily]
-...we turn to Tiffany Albrecht,

02:17.470 --> 02:18.805
live at Standish headquarters.

02:18.888 --> 02:21.015
Tiffany, what can you tell us about this?

02:21.391 --> 02:23.518
It's a bombshell, and it's gone off

02:23.601 --> 02:25.103
on Election Day.

02:25.186 --> 02:28.398
-This seems unprecedented.
-It is a bombshell, Pat, and so far,

02:28.481 --> 02:30.316
the Standish campaign has been silent.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.944

[Pat] ...what do you believe the impact
on today's election will be...

02:45.039 --> 02:47.417
-Mom!
-What? I'm trying to watch this.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.128
This was in the trash, Mom.
We talked about this.

02:50.211 --> 02:53.506
I'm sorry. I was going to take it out
and put it in the recycling.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.258
A thousand years, Mom.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.302
That's how long this'll sit
in a landfill, so...

02:57.385 --> 02:59.470
-[opens, shuts drawer]
-I said I am sorry.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.514
-Shh.
-[Tiffany] The Times story alleges

03:01.598 --> 03:03.057
that the three-way relationship,

03:03.141 --> 03:06.144
the so-called throuple, was an invention
on the part of the Standish campaign

03:06.227 --> 03:08.438
designed to inject
some youthful excitement

03:08.521 --> 03:10.064
and, quote, "sex appeal"

03:10.148 --> 03:11.482
to try and stop the momentum

03:11.566 --> 03:14.110
-of Payton Hobart.
-Oh, my God. This is amazing.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.029
Don't say that.
Saying something like that's

03:16.112 --> 03:17.322
what's wrong with this country.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.323
-What?
-They think

03:18.406 --> 03:19.699
this is what people care about.

03:19.782 --> 03:22.118
I don't give a shit
what she does in her bedroom.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.329
Um, do you care that she's a liar?

03:24.412 --> 03:26.206
She lied, and she's a dinosaur,

03:26.289 --> 03:28.499
and Payton Hobart
is a genuine man of character

03:28.583 --> 03:30.251
who actually cares about this planet.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.587
Sweetie, I am so glad
that you are politically active,

03:32.670 --> 03:34.964
I really am. It's one
of my proudest achievements.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.718
But you are taking down the wrong woman,
and this is a smear.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.345
No, no, no, wait, which is it?

03:40.428 --> 03:41.679
She lied, and you don't care,

03:41.763 --> 03:43.473
or she didn't lie,
and this is all made up?

03:43.556 --> 03:45.683
-I don't care.
-Because Dede Standish has been lying

03:45.767 --> 03:47.894
her entire career, Mom.

03:47.977 --> 03:49.437
Every politician has.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.940
They've known about global warming
since the 1960s,

03:52.023 --> 03:53.524
and nobody's done anything about it.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.069
What, is Dede Standish suddenly
a lobbyist for Exxon?

03:56.152 --> 03:58.029
What are you talking about?

03:58.112 --> 04:00.949
That woman has made our lives
demonstrably better.

04:01.032 --> 04:03.701
-[news continues indistinctly]
-When did we move here? When was it?

04:03.785 --> 04:05.411
Um, 2003.

04:05.870 --> 04:09.832
Remember when garbage trucks used to park
outside our building overnight?

04:10.416 --> 04:11.251
She banned that!

04:11.751 --> 04:13.211
She-- Remember summer camp?

04:13.419 --> 04:15.713
She is the reason why they were required
to have EpiPens.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.174
She is why I can't get fired
for being gay!

04:18.258 --> 04:21.219
She's why there is a charter school
two blocks away

04:21.302 --> 04:22.637
that you got to go to!

04:22.720 --> 04:23.596
You met her.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.515
She sends us a Christmas card every year,

04:25.598 --> 04:26.808
and suddenly she's Hannity

04:26.891 --> 04:29.143
because she's not hysterical
about climate change?

04:29.644 --> 04:30.853
Maybe that is a sign

04:30.937 --> 04:33.940
that global warming is not the one issue

04:34.023 --> 04:35.984
we all need to get up in arms about!

04:37.235 --> 04:38.194
Okay, boomer.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.488
What did you just say to me?

04:40.571 --> 04:43.199
[muffled]
The world is gonna end in ten years, Mom.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.576
I am barely a boomer, okay?

04:45.660 --> 04:47.578
So don't throw that shit at me.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.956
And the world is not gonna end

04:50.039 --> 04:52.208
-in ten years, Jayne!
-What would you care?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.335
You can't even recycle
a frigging toothbrush.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.130
Yeah, that's right.
Because I can never do enough for you.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.966
Whatever I do, I'm always screwing it up!

05:00.967 --> 05:02.844
I try recycling, not enough.

05:02.927 --> 05:07.223
I got a goddamn fucking compost bin
under the sink.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.268
Not enough. I cook you vegan eggs...

05:10.351 --> 05:12.603
-I know.
-...whatever the fuck those are,

05:12.687 --> 05:14.230
and still, I am the problem.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.107
I'm not saying you.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.942
I'm saying people your age.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.361
Let me tell you something.
People your age, your generation,

05:20.445 --> 05:23.156
you think you know everything,
and you are really fucking naive.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.450
When I was your age,
I thought I knew everything too,

05:25.533 --> 05:28.411
and I voted for Reagan.
I'm still trying to live that down.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.371
We're not naive, Mom.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.748
We're informed.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.876
You had what?
Like, two newspapers, three networks?

05:34.959 --> 05:36.836
I've got a supercomputer in my pocket.

05:36.919 --> 05:39.255
[scoffs] The least informed person my age

05:39.339 --> 05:42.633
knows more than the most informed person
your age. That's just a fact.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.135
Okay, fine, I'm an idiot.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.764
I somehow raised you for 20 years,
on my own,

05:47.847 --> 05:49.682
but clearly, I know absolutely nothing.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.267
Thank you so much, Jayne.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.102
Have a fun election day.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.104
So nice talking to you, Mom.

We just dropped some major-league shit
on Dede Standish.

-Once this whole shitshow is over,

06:27.929 --> 06:29.347

I don't think you even know my name.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.476
So? It doesn't have to be serious.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.894
I'm in kind of a rebound sitch.

06:35.603 --> 06:39.190
-Uh... no.
-No, I'm not in a rebound sitch?

06:39.774 --> 06:41.025
Because I am.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.070
Infinity and I dated for, like,
six months,

06:44.153 --> 06:45.696
and then, out of nowhere, she broke--

06:45.780 --> 06:48.658
No, I meant, no, we're not gonna go out.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.034
You're awful.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.036
Well, you're... fired.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.540
I'm a volunteer,
so I don't think I can be fired.

we're not gonna win this election!

You've ruined the elections
we have going forward

Not bad. Thanks for asking.

That's so nice.
Thank you for not hanging up.

Um, I'm just calling to remind you
that today is election day,

Okay, it looks like
there's a polling place

at the 24th Street Public Library.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.986
Is that convenient, or do you need me
to find a different place?

-I'm actually at work right now...
-Okay. That sounds good.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.574

No, that's actually Payton Hobart
right now.

about representing the 27th District
in Albany next year.

-Okay, you have another location,

which is 456 7th Ave.

for one quick second?

You're fucking fired! Get out!

We are looking at wait times
for up to 30 minutes

to cast a vote...

Um... you, what's your name?

09:06.629 --> 09:08.422
I know this.
I found you to be very impressive.

-Jayne Mueller. You're a Taurus.
-Yes!

09:10.258 --> 09:13.344
Okay, excellent. Love the effort.
How many of your friends have voted today?

09:13.427 --> 09:15.805
Uh, let me check Instagram super quickly.
One second.

Hold on, hold on, hold on.

I don't know. A lot. Like, most of them.

-Okay.
-Did you hear this?

09:23.104 --> 09:23.938

They say this could be the biggest turnout

09:25.731 --> 09:28.025
for a state senate seat
in the history of New York.

-[Skye] Hey, hey.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.613
And black Twitter is behind you.

I mean, like, the 75 people that I know
that are black and on Twitter.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.704
Okay, uh,
what do we have planned for today?

09:39.787 --> 09:42.373
Uh, you and Alice go vote, do a presser,
and that's it.

09:42.456 --> 09:43.749
That's it? Nothing else?

09:43.833 --> 09:45.209
And a concession speech.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.253
I mean, we all agreed
that you would probably lose.

09:47.336 --> 09:48.212
Okay, change of plans.

-What time do polls close?
-9:00.

Okay, 9:00. Uh, we need an event.

I want outside Madison Square Park,
3:00 p.m. I want every news outlet there.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.846
-What event?
-I don't know. Figure it out!

09:58.723 --> 10:00.975
Okay. You, you, and you, come with me.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.561
Uh, I didn't finish my call list.
Is that okay?

10:03.644 --> 10:05.521
Yeah. Give your call list
to somebody else, okay?

10:05.605 --> 10:06.772
This is way more important!

10:09.525 --> 10:13.070
Thank you, Mr. Naybor, and there you go.

10:13.487 --> 10:15.239
Voting booths are right over there.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.575
I haven't seen a turnout like this before.
Have you?

10:17.658 --> 10:20.870
I-- No. I usually vote right away
when I get here, and there was a line

10:20.953 --> 10:21.912
-out the door.
-No.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.372
Yes. Hi.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.416
-Um, name, please?
-Akta Shah.

10:25.499 --> 10:26.709
S-H-A-H.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.794
[reporter] Is the throuple a lie?

10:28.878 --> 10:31.005
-[Hadassah] We're not making a comment.
-Here it is.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.466
-[Dede] Guys, I told you...
-Hi.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.009
-...no comment.
-Hadassah Gold.

10:35.092 --> 10:37.178
Say, would you mind
if Senator Standish and I,

10:37.261 --> 10:38.262
uh, cut in front of you?

10:38.346 --> 10:40.014
I've been waiting in line
for half an hour.

10:40.097 --> 10:42.433
Yes, but she's who you're waiting in line
to vote for,

10:42.516 --> 10:43.559
so we're gonna cut.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.728
[Hadassah] Hi.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.980
-Hadassah Gold. Dede Standish.
-Of course.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.357
-Pleasure.
-Hello. How are you?

10:49.774 --> 10:51.192
-Can I have that quickly?
-Of course.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.486
-Yes. Thank you, yeah.
-Yes. Here is you.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.072
Uh, F through L is just over here.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.240
-Give me a fucking takeout menu...
-Okay, I'm off.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.576
...and I'll vote with that.
We're trying to get in and out.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.704
Of course.
We actually met before, Ms. Gold.

11:03.788 --> 11:04.705
Andi Mueller.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.540
-Um...
-Oh, nice to see you again.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.085
-Any comment on the article?
-Will you be giving any statement?

11:09.168 --> 11:10.461
Oh, my God.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.254
-No, no!
-Any comment on the Times article?

11:12.338 --> 11:14.256
Nuh-uh-uh! No, no, no.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.050
We're not doing that today, guys.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.177
We are not doing that.

11:18.260 --> 11:20.304
We've got a whole day of events to plan,

11:20.388 --> 11:22.807
-and we are so sorry.
-[reporter] Does your husband sell papers

11:22.890 --> 11:24.600
-to undergrads?
-We are not making a comment.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.394
[Dede]
I was going to comment on this later.

11:26.477 --> 11:29.814
However, I have not read the article,

11:29.897 --> 11:33.192
but I can tell you
that there is not one word of truth to it.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.194
You haven't read it, so how do you know?

11:35.986 --> 11:39.490
-Nobody cares about this.
-[Dede] Well, I'm telling you otherwise,

11:39.573 --> 11:42.451
so why are we still having
this conversation?

11:42.535 --> 11:45.413
So, that's your statement?
The reporter is lying?

11:45.496 --> 11:47.289
This is why people don't trust the media.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.959
You know that, right?

11:50.251 --> 11:51.127
Andi.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.130
What? Fuck them. This is bullshit.
It's bullshit.

11:54.213 --> 11:57.049
[Dede continues indistinctly to reporters]

11:57.425 --> 11:58.843
Hi there. Uh, Payton Hobart,

11:58.926 --> 12:00.136
-Alice Charles.
-Okay,

12:00.219 --> 12:01.387
but the line starts outside.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.557
Okay, do you mind if we go ahead of you?
They don't mind. All right.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.727
[Dede]
...really impacting people's lives in a...

12:07.810 --> 12:10.271
[reporter 2] How do you think
this will affect voters?

12:10.354 --> 12:12.523
[reporter 3] Have you read the article?
Care to comment?

12:12.606 --> 12:14.942
-[reporters chattering]
-[reporter 1] Hey, Payton!

12:15.609 --> 12:16.485
-Payton.
-Hey.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.029
Would you care to comment
on this morning's Times article?

12:19.113 --> 12:20.239
Honestly, I haven't read it.

12:20.656 --> 12:23.075
That's bullshit. You fed 'em that story.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.161
As a matter of fact,
my fiancée and I just received

12:25.244 --> 12:27.788
some very amazing news
that we would love to share.

12:28.539 --> 12:31.292
Alice is pregnant. We'll be expecting
our first child next summer.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.294
-[reporter 2] Senator...
-Oh, for fuck's sake.

12:33.377 --> 12:34.545
[reporter 1] Congratulations.

12:34.628 --> 12:35.963
Thank you. We're very excited.

12:36.046 --> 12:39.592
Indeed, and today we have to say
that we have our little one on our minds.

12:39.675 --> 12:43.012
Right now, it is more important than ever
to be focusing not only on our generation

12:43.095 --> 12:44.722
but on the next, and the kind of planet

12:44.805 --> 12:46.849
that we are all gonna be handing to them.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.184
Know what? As a matter of fact,

12:48.267 --> 12:50.060
-we were just looking at something.
-Yes.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.271
-I'm gonna grab it real quick.
-So, William Ward stating

12:52.354 --> 12:54.231
that he's actually dating
your campaign manager,

12:54.315 --> 12:55.191
that's untrue?

12:55.274 --> 12:57.818
I'm not gonna even dignify that question
with a response.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.195
This interview is over. Nonstory.

12:59.278 --> 13:02.156
The allegation that you and your husband
are sleeping with one of his students?

13:02.239 --> 13:05.451
I'm not understanding anything
that you just said.

13:05.534 --> 13:06.994
-Okay? Thank you.
-[Payton] So...

13:07.077 --> 13:09.455
as you can see, uh,
this is a map of our entire planet

13:09.538 --> 13:11.165
with a rise in global temperature

13:11.248 --> 13:14.460
of just four degrees Celsius.
Now, the lower 48: desert.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.755
Most of humanity will be forced to migrate
to Canada, Alaska, Scandinavia.

13:18.422 --> 13:19.423
Could not be more urgent.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.550
Now is the time to take action,

13:21.634 --> 13:24.887
and, please, join us for our rally
for climate action today,

13:24.970 --> 13:26.263
three o'clock this afternoon

13:26.347 --> 13:27.515
in Madison Square Park.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.475
All right, honey, what do you say?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.519
Shall we cast our ballots
for climate action?

13:31.602 --> 13:34.939
Yes. I'm ready to make a difference.
[giggles]

13:35.022 --> 13:36.023
Thanks so much.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.360
[Hadassah] That was a shitshow.

13:39.443 --> 13:40.653
Why did you stop?

13:41.153 --> 13:42.530
Why didn't you just say, "Sorry,

13:42.613 --> 13:43.447
didn't hear you.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.783
Left my hearing aids at home,"
and walk the fuck out?

13:45.866 --> 13:47.910
-I couldn't just walk the fuck out.
-[Andi] Excuse me?

13:47.993 --> 13:50.079
-I had to say something.
-So you opted

13:50.162 --> 13:52.915
-for "The New York Times is lying"?
-Excuse me. [laughs]

13:52.998 --> 13:55.042
-Senator Standish.
-We're really in a hurry.

13:55.125 --> 13:58.087
I'm sorry. Hi, my name is Andi Mueller.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.922
We've met a few times, and, um...

14:00.339 --> 14:02.174
-I'm on your Christmas card list.
-Oh, yeah.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.760
-[spluttering] I do recognize you.
-Oh!

14:04.844 --> 14:08.055
Well, I just wanted to tell you,
and I'm sure you know this already,

14:08.138 --> 14:10.516
but voter turnout has been
really high today,

14:10.599 --> 14:12.601
and we are seeing a lot of young people--

14:12.685 --> 14:14.436
Oh, please, for every young person
who votes,

14:14.520 --> 14:16.564
there'll be ten old farts! [laughs]

14:16.647 --> 14:17.940
-Come on, let's go.
-Okay.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.108
-My--
-Andi,

14:19.984 --> 14:22.069
the good news is we are up by 15 points.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.737
It's a little tighter than we expected,

14:23.821 --> 14:26.532
but don't you worry,
we are gonna win this thing.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.450
So good to see you.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.327
-That's very-- Yes?
-Would you like

14:30.411 --> 14:33.247
to come to our victory party
at our offices tonight?

14:33.330 --> 14:34.915
You'd be welcome. You know where we are.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.834
-Up on 7th?
-That's right. Yes.

14:36.917 --> 14:37.793
-Okay.
-[Andi chuckles]

14:37.877 --> 14:38.961
[Dede laughs]

14:39.420 --> 14:40.880
[tires screech]

14:44.216 --> 14:45.259
Where does this go?

14:45.676 --> 14:46.969
Uh, I'm not sure.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.555
You've never put together
a camping shower before?

14:49.638 --> 14:50.890
No. Why would I?

14:50.973 --> 14:52.266
I don't know, you kinda have that

14:52.349 --> 14:54.476
"I did Outward Bound
the summer of my freshman year"

14:54.560 --> 14:57.479
or "I have a small coven with my friends,
and we spend weekends in the woods

14:57.563 --> 14:59.273
for the autumn equinox each year" look.

14:59.356 --> 15:02.234
Although, neither of those sound like
a trip where bathing's a priority.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.237
I'm from the West Village.
I went to Spence.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.449
Sorry, I tend to put people in boxes
without much due diligence.

15:08.532 --> 15:11.118
I need to triage people immediately.
"Is this a voter? For us?

15:11.201 --> 15:13.287
If they're not,
how do I make them a voter for us?"

15:14.246 --> 15:16.123
So, uh, what's exactly the plan here?

15:16.206 --> 15:17.625
I'm not entirely sure.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.627
I think Payton takes a freezing shower,

15:19.710 --> 15:22.004
and then we save and reuse the water.
I don't know.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.006
Some of that zero-waste bullshit
that people love.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.383
And it's one of those
great viral photo ops

15:26.467 --> 15:28.552
that the media can't stop themselves
from using.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.180
Exit polling is all over the place.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.474
-Oh, is that bad?
-[Payton] No, no, no.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.100
It's good. Usually, in a race like this

15:35.184 --> 15:37.186
with a strong incumbent,
the exit polling's clear.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.021
The fact she's not crushing us is telling.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.650
-How's it going here?
-[McAfee] Trouble with the assembly.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.610
-She doesn't know how to build one?
-No.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.862
Really? You never backpacked
the Appalachian Trail

15:46.946 --> 15:48.906
or did a chain-yourself-to-a-tree protest?

15:48.989 --> 15:50.741
No, and she didn't
do Outward Bound either.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.078
I'm gonna go find an Allen wrench.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.291
Can I ask you a question?

15:59.667 --> 16:00.584
Mm-hmm.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.045
If doing stuff like this didn't poll well,

16:03.128 --> 16:04.546
would you still be doing it?

16:05.172 --> 16:07.049
Are you asking me if I care
about the environment

16:07.132 --> 16:08.968
and the future of the planet
you and I inherit?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.844
Of course.
It's the centerpiece of my campaign.

16:10.928 --> 16:11.929
Yeah, but...

16:12.513 --> 16:13.722
it didn't start that way.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.933
You started out talking about the subway

16:16.016 --> 16:18.852
and how Dede was out of touch
with the working-class people of New York,

16:18.936 --> 16:21.105
and then suddenly,
it was all about the environment.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.232
Well, campaigns evolve. Candidates evolve.

16:23.774 --> 16:24.900
Look, I can honestly say

16:24.984 --> 16:27.152
I've always wanted to win the race,
but I wasn't inspired

16:27.236 --> 16:28.988
until I started talking
about the environment.

16:29.613 --> 16:30.656
When you started winning.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.450
All right. You wanna have
the adult conversation about this?

16:33.784 --> 16:35.619
It's both, okay?

16:35.703 --> 16:38.664
I believe we're in a climate emergency
and our political leaders have failed

16:38.747 --> 16:41.250
the younger generation by ignoring it,
so if...

16:43.210 --> 16:46.088
when I win,
I will commit to focusing on that issue

16:46.171 --> 16:48.674
because there is really no problem
that's more all-encompassing.

16:48.757 --> 16:50.718
And the only way I'm gonna win this race

16:50.801 --> 16:52.302
is to get young people to vote.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.180
And the only thing that truly inspires
young people to get off their buns

16:55.264 --> 16:57.474
and actually vote is climate change.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.269
If that issue was economic inequality

17:00.352 --> 17:01.770
or, like, guns, or the subway,

17:01.854 --> 17:03.981
I'd still spend my life
fighting to save the planet,

17:04.440 --> 17:08.110
but, no, I probably would not be taking
a cold shower in Madison Square.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.156
There's probably a YouTube how-to
for this.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.996
[man] Um, the line was--
was a bit ridiculous,

17:19.079 --> 17:23.709
but I found it was a good time to,
like, think about what I heard today...

17:23.792 --> 17:25.377
[Hadassah] Get that idiot on the phone.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.796
[Dede] I can't. Well, I can't--
I can't get him on the phone,

17:27.880 --> 17:29.089
because he's stalling.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.675
-[upbeat music plays over speakers]
-[overlapping chatter]

17:44.938 --> 17:45.814
Hey,

17:46.231 --> 17:47.649
would it be possible

17:47.733 --> 17:49.693
for me to talk to Hadassah or Dede?

17:49.777 --> 17:50.903
Not a problem.

17:50.986 --> 17:54.323
They love to talk to randos
who look like Upper West Side therapists

17:54.406 --> 17:57.201
who incorporate macramé
into their sessions.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.411
[Andi chuckles]

17:59.953 --> 18:02.122
Um, I spoke with them this morning.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.209
I-- I volunteer as an election judge--

18:05.292 --> 18:07.878
I don't trust people
who are willing to work for no money.

18:07.961 --> 18:09.588
I mean, what's in it for them?

18:09.671 --> 18:10.923
This is ugly.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.802
I believe in Senator Standish,

18:14.885 --> 18:16.720
-and I want her to win.
-So do I.

18:16.804 --> 18:20.641
Though I'd trade victory
for a slow-motion video of Hadassah's face

18:20.724 --> 18:22.184
when she hears that we lost.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.521
[plastic crackling]

18:32.736 --> 18:33.862
You don't recycle here?

18:33.946 --> 18:36.365
I've toured the recycling centers
in this city.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.284
Let me peel back that curtain for ya.
It's a scam.

18:40.035 --> 18:42.788
Most of the stuff ends up
in the same landfill

18:42.871 --> 18:45.374
or lodged in some whale's anus.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.875
[Dede and Hadassah] No fight, no flight.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.669
-Come on. Let's go.
-We need to get the van.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.129
Okay, we need to get the van

18:50.212 --> 18:53.799
and get those 75 votes
at the retirement home.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.801
-Senator Standish?
-Yes.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.761
Hi. It's, uh-- It's Andi.

18:58.345 --> 18:59.179
Do you have a van?

18:59.263 --> 19:00.347
No, uh...

19:00.430 --> 19:03.308
-I live in the city, I don't drive a car.
-[Hadassah] Oh, I know you.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.435
You tried to warn us
about the voter turnout problem.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.604
You said there wasn't a turnout problem.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.647
-[Dede] Well...
-Well...

19:08.730 --> 19:10.691
-We were wrong.
-...it turned out it was a problem.

19:10.774 --> 19:11.733
Marcus, pick up.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.443
[Andi] It's young people.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.487
I was working the voting station
all morning.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.656
It's two voters under 30
to every one over 50.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.700
-Oh, God.
-My daughter is a student at NYU.

19:19.783 --> 19:22.578
To them, you and Strom Thurmond

19:22.661 --> 19:24.538
might as well have the same policies
and beliefs.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.957
You're some old lady who
doesn't understand what's important.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.543
Excuse me, we have been fighting
for progressive causes

19:29.626 --> 19:31.295
since, frankly, before they were born.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.005
Oh, I know that, but they don't.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.592
Look, lots of kids voted today.
There are lots that didn't.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.886
Go down to her campus. Show your face.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.220
Get them to vote for you.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.723
Convince one,
and they will bring ten with them.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.437
Little retail politics.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.063
Just like the old days.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.192
Let's go.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.235
-And you're coming with us.
-Really?

19:55.319 --> 19:56.528
Yeah, come on. Just come.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.238
-Yeah?
-Get in. Get in the car.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.157
-[vehicle beeping]
-[workers chattering]

20:00.240 --> 20:02.117
[Dede] How long have we been in this car?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.660
This is not a good idea.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.245
Should we just get out and walk?

20:05.329 --> 20:07.456
We're, like, ten blocks away.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.541
-That's a good idea.
-Oh! That's a very good idea.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.667
Where are my Easy Spirits?

20:11.293 --> 20:12.294
Don't you have them?

20:12.502 --> 20:15.255
-Why would I have them?
-Because they're your shoes.

20:15.672 --> 20:16.882
[Dede] For three decades,

20:16.965 --> 20:19.593
you've run my campaigns,
you've been my press secretary,

20:19.676 --> 20:21.345
you've edited my speeches,

20:21.428 --> 20:23.639
you have carried my goddamn lipstick

20:23.722 --> 20:25.766
and my Easy Spirit walking shoes.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.478
Did I miss the memo
where you decided to change

20:29.561 --> 20:30.646
your job description?

20:30.729 --> 20:31.980
Forgive me, Dede,

20:32.231 --> 20:33.941
I'm just the tiniest bit distracted

20:34.024 --> 20:36.777
by the fact we may actually, shockingly,

20:36.860 --> 20:40.906
lose this election to a bunch of entitled,
virtue-signaling little brats

20:40.989 --> 20:43.116
who want to reforest Manhattan

20:43.200 --> 20:46.870
and slap a beehive on the rooftop
of every tenement in town!

20:46.954 --> 20:50.290
Oh, my God, how do you counter
such inauthentic bullshit?

20:51.333 --> 20:53.585
It's not bullshit to young people.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.838
[chuckles] My daughter cares about
the health of the planet

20:56.922 --> 20:58.840
more than she cares about
her own economic future.

20:59.758 --> 21:00.884
Unlike us.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.094
I mean,

21:02.177 --> 21:03.720
your generation, my generation.

21:03.804 --> 21:07.683
She-- She literally does not care
if she never owns a house or a car.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.893
She just wants to make sure
she has clean air and water,

21:09.977 --> 21:12.980
and that we don't end up
with a climate refugee crisis

21:13.063 --> 21:14.022
in five years,

21:14.106 --> 21:16.525
which we authentically might.

21:16.608 --> 21:17.734
Well, that's not our fault.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.279
It... kind of is.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.656
Look, missy,
when I was your daughter's age,

21:22.739 --> 21:25.033
I fought for selfless,
unattainable goals too.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.287
I burnt my bra. I marched against the war.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.790
I saved the manatees.
I spawned with the fricking salmon, okay?

21:31.873 --> 21:34.126
There is a bald eagle in Central Park

21:34.584 --> 21:37.087
that wouldn't be there
if it wasn't for Senator Standish.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.338
I love the environment.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.841
I have fought for it,

21:41.300 --> 21:44.177
and I am really delighted to know that

21:44.261 --> 21:47.806
the young people are energized about it,
but they shouldn't be in charge.

21:47.889 --> 21:50.434
They should be part of the conversation,
of course, sure,

21:50.517 --> 21:51.977
but they should not be in charge.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.687
They just shouldn't be.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.231
Passion is wonderful.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.317
I also have experience.

21:58.525 --> 21:59.735
I am very experienced,

21:59.818 --> 22:01.028
and I have discipline.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.031
And passion without experience
and discipline

22:04.323 --> 22:05.240
is chaos.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.034
Anarchy, okay?

22:07.909 --> 22:08.994
[phone vibrating]

22:09.077 --> 22:09.995
[Hadassah] What?

22:10.329 --> 22:11.204
Oh!

22:11.663 --> 22:13.540
Oh, yes, hello, Mr. Mayor.

22:13.957 --> 22:15.834
Hold for Senator Standish.

22:16.835 --> 22:17.878
[Dede laughs] Hello, Bill.

22:17.961 --> 22:21.006
Well, it's a little closer than any of us
would like.

22:21.506 --> 22:22.632
Okay, wha--

22:22.716 --> 22:23.967
Oh, hold-- hold on.

22:24.801 --> 22:25.802
We're not there yet.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.637
[horns honking]

22:30.057 --> 22:32.059
[crowd cheering nearby]

22:37.147 --> 22:38.148
[Payton] That's right,

22:38.231 --> 22:40.192
because we care about the next generation

22:40.275 --> 22:42.778
and the next, and the next, and the next,

22:42.861 --> 22:45.614
and that is why we are going
to cast a vote for change today.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.699
[crowd cheering]

22:49.951 --> 22:52.079
Because we have ten years
to save the world,

22:52.162 --> 22:54.873
and if we are willing to fight
and never stop fighting,

22:54.956 --> 22:57.084
then we can save this planet.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.670
We don't have to wait around
for the change! We are the change!

23:00.754 --> 23:02.923
[cheering]

23:03.006 --> 23:05.634
We will do whatever we can
to stop this planet from warming

23:05.717 --> 23:08.595
because today is the day
that we save the world.

23:08.678 --> 23:09.805
[cheering]

23:13.183 --> 23:14.142
Yes.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.145
And now to prove
to each and every one of you here today

23:17.229 --> 23:18.397
how excited I am

23:18.480 --> 23:21.691
for a new, very chilled planet,

23:22.317 --> 23:23.652
I am going to do the thing

23:23.735 --> 23:25.904
that I hate more than anything else
in the world.

23:25.987 --> 23:28.115
I am going to take a freezing cold shower,

23:28.782 --> 23:30.951
and then I am going to recycle
that gray water!

23:31.034 --> 23:32.702
[cheering]

23:34.371 --> 23:35.497
[Skye] All right.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.249
This is for real, everybody.

23:37.332 --> 23:39.543
It is 31 degrees outside,

23:39.626 --> 23:42.337
and that water is coming
right out of that tap, okay?

23:42.421 --> 23:44.464
[cheering]

23:46.758 --> 23:48.218
-[Payton] Oh!
-[cheering grows louder]

23:48.301 --> 23:49.719
[Skye] How is it, Payton? How is it?

23:49.803 --> 23:52.389
[voice shaking]
Okay. Um... it is very cold, indeed.

23:53.098 --> 23:56.226
All right, the polls close at 9:00 p.m.
Thank you all for coming.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.353
Let's change the world, everybody.
God bless!

23:58.437 --> 24:00.313
[cheering]

24:01.773 --> 24:03.525
[softly] Okay, all right. Let's go.

24:05.694 --> 24:08.029
Go, Payton! Whoo!

24:22.043 --> 24:23.170
[man] Name, please.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.880
Andi Mueller.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.277
-[reporter speaks indistinctly]
-[door opens]

24:48.945 --> 24:49.988
[Andi sighs]

24:51.615 --> 24:53.366
-Sweetheart.
-What?

24:55.076 --> 24:56.119
Come here.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.789
Come here.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.464
Oh, sweetie,
I'm so sorry about this morning.

25:07.547 --> 25:09.090
Mom, it's okay.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.009
No, it's not.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.386
I said some stuff I really didn't like.

25:13.595 --> 25:14.596
I'm sorry.

25:15.722 --> 25:17.349
I'm so proud of you.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.518
And I... [sighs]

25:19.601 --> 25:22.270
...I want us to be able to disagree
and it not turn into a fight.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.898
-It's fine, Mom.
-No, it isn't.

25:24.981 --> 25:27.317
If I let politics come between us,

25:28.735 --> 25:30.237
I am part of the problem.

25:30.445 --> 25:31.488
We both are.

25:31.571 --> 25:33.323
We have to listen to one another

25:33.406 --> 25:35.534
and respect one another,
and I didn't do that.

25:35.867 --> 25:39.079
Well, I didn't either, so it's okay.

25:39.162 --> 25:40.830
Promise me we're not gonna do that again.

25:40.914 --> 25:43.375
-Okay?
-Breaking news now from the politics desk.

25:43.458 --> 25:44.376
Oh, my God, Mom.

25:44.459 --> 25:45.627
-What?
-The returns are in.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.671
...the New York 27th Senate District,

25:47.754 --> 25:49.965
where Dede Standish
is attempting to hold off a--

25:50.048 --> 25:51.424
Mom, what are you doing?

25:51.508 --> 25:53.677
-They're gonna announce who won.
-I know.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.097
But whoever wins,

25:58.181 --> 26:00.058
I want you to know
that I know you were right.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.186
We had our shot,

26:03.270 --> 26:04.312
my generation,

26:05.397 --> 26:06.648
and we screwed it up.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.483
We left you with...

26:09.901 --> 26:11.444
an impossible situation,

26:11.528 --> 26:15.031
and I am so deeply, deeply, deeply
sorry for that.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.076
It's your turn now.

26:19.869 --> 26:21.955
Oh, my God, you didn't.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.707
Yep. [sighing]

26:23.790 --> 26:24.791
I did.

26:26.334 --> 26:27.627
I voted for Payton.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.296
Oh, my God, Mom!

26:29.379 --> 26:31.131
Thank you so much!

26:31.214 --> 26:32.507
I'm so happy!

26:32.841 --> 26:34.301
Oh, I love you, sweetheart.

26:34.384 --> 26:35.844
I love you too, Mom.

26:36.469 --> 26:39.139
-Now, turn on the TV. I wanna see who won.
-Okay.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.181
[sighs]

26:43.393 --> 26:44.519
[TV clicks on]

26:46.354 --> 26:49.274
[instrumental theme music plays]
