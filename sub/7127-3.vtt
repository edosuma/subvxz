00:01.067 --> 00:04.833
You have no idea the month I've
had. I've been having hallucinations,

00:04.938 --> 00:06.906
like George Michael in my living room,

00:07.007 --> 00:09.874
which means I've either got
the best pay-per-view service

00:09.943 --> 00:13.811
or an inoperable brain aneurysm.
Turns out, my luck, it's B.

00:13.880 --> 00:17.543
If I didn't take the news well,
my fiancée took it even worse.

00:17.617 --> 00:21.451
It's not that we've been fighting,
but, there's been fighting around us.

00:21.521 --> 00:24.957
This craziness is what ruined
my parents' relationship too.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.890
My dad had the same aneurysm.

00:26.960 --> 00:31.124
It wasn't exactly a picnic for those
of us around him. But I'm not crazy.

00:31.197 --> 00:34.166
Some think that these visions
mean that I'm some kind of,

00:34.234 --> 00:36.668
I hate this part, modern-day prophet,

00:36.736 --> 00:40.103
and I should be using my law degree
to improve the world.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.673
So there you have it.

00:41.741 --> 00:45.438
Hallucinations, aneurysm, prophet,
relationship on the rocks.

00:45.512 --> 00:48.413
Either way, very bad karma
for you to take my convertible.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.942
Little sob story over?
Because I gotta take the car now.

00:52.018 --> 00:53.883
It's not just a car. It's who I am.

00:53.953 --> 00:55.511
Apparently, it's who you were.

00:55.588 --> 00:57.556
It's who I could be,
if you put my car down.

00:57.657 --> 01:00.820
That's the problem, pal.
Technically, it's not your car.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.988
The firm paid the lease,
the firm doesn't want to pay anymore.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.726
Ipso facto, car goes back-o.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.361
- You're using "ipso facto" wrong.
- Not helping your case.

01:10.470 --> 01:14.839
Come on, let me keep it one more day.
I'll give you 50 bucks, cash.

01:14.941 --> 01:19.241
Seems to me, a real prophet,
he would've seen this coming.

01:31.324 --> 01:33.451
- You look terrible.
- Good morning, Patti.

01:33.526 --> 01:35.289
You're late for another meeting.

01:35.395 --> 01:37.056
- I get a prize for that?
- Yeah.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.030
I think they call it a pink slip.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.761
I would've been on time,
but Jordan repossessed my car.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.303
I had to take two buses
and a BART train to get here.

01:44.370 --> 01:46.634
Ever take the bus?
They stop for everybody.

01:46.706 --> 01:49.675
He took your company car?
Your... What did you call it?

01:49.776 --> 01:51.437
My Millennium Falcon.

01:51.511 --> 01:54.378
You used to make shooting sounds
when you changed lanes.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.415
Yeah, that.

01:56.516 --> 01:59.383
That's one less thing to bug
the hell out of me about you.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.216
My practice is changing,
whether Jordan likes it or not.

02:02.322 --> 02:05.655
- He's not going to break me.
- Your engagement party is breaking me.

02:05.725 --> 02:09.092
I just finished color-coding
150 R.S.V.P.'s

02:09.195 --> 02:13.325
because your fiancée isn't happy
with a simple yes or no.

02:13.399 --> 02:16.334
Have I mentioned what a great job
you're doing with that?

02:16.402 --> 02:18.870
Doesn't she have her own assistant?

02:18.938 --> 02:21.998
Come on, it's a whole bonding thing
for you two.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.339
Anyway, her assistant's busy doing...

02:24.410 --> 02:26.241
Her job?

02:27.013 --> 02:30.505
- And the morning's complete.
- Matt Dowd's out of town taking depos,

02:30.583 --> 02:34.075
someone needs to argue a motion
in limine for his Ketwilder case,

02:34.154 --> 02:37.385
- I need you to back my play.
- I don't know about Ketwilder.

02:37.457 --> 02:40.187
It's a motion to suppress.
I just need to win it.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.625
After last week's fiasco,

02:41.694 --> 02:44.595
I need to get on the horse,
take a second bite at the apple.

02:44.664 --> 02:48.031
I'm not sure supporting you
is gonna help with your metaphors.

02:48.134 --> 02:50.261
Eli, seriously, I can smell it.

02:50.336 --> 02:53.499
I need a win,
or I'm gonna get pushed out the door.

02:53.573 --> 02:54.904
Help me out.

02:58.178 --> 03:01.739
And although the firm has acquired
two new Fortune-500 clients,

03:01.848 --> 03:05.750
associate billables are off
one-half percent from last quarter.

03:05.818 --> 03:07.581
The partners are concerned.

03:07.687 --> 03:11.987
Sir, many of us are already staying here
overnight, sleeping on cots.

03:12.058 --> 03:16.427
Ah, make a note to remove the cots
from the offices.

03:16.496 --> 03:19.260
That should get
those billables right up.

03:19.332 --> 03:23.359
Kidding. Or not. You decide.

03:23.436 --> 03:26.200
We need someone to assist
with the Ketwilder matter.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.740
Oh, I'd like to step up
and handle that, sir.

03:30.109 --> 03:32.043
Who are you
and why are you at my table?

03:32.111 --> 03:35.171
Maggie Dekker.
I'm fully versed on the case,

03:35.248 --> 03:37.341
and I've enlisted Mr. Stone
to back me up.

03:37.417 --> 03:40.978
Really? Perhaps this is a step
in the right direction, Mr. Stone.

03:42.522 --> 03:44.149
I hate you.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.931
Go! Go, go!

04:00.273 --> 04:03.765
You took your damn sweet time
getting here, didn't you, soldier?

04:03.843 --> 04:06.607
Why are you talking to me?
My visions don't talk to me!

04:06.679 --> 04:09.239
Private Swain's pinned down
and taking fire!

04:09.315 --> 04:10.748
What?

04:10.817 --> 04:14.719
We gonna have to advance on that ridge!
Private Swain's counting on us!

04:14.787 --> 04:16.152
Who's Private Swain?

04:16.255 --> 04:20.214
The next casualty in this war,
unless we do something, soldier!

04:33.339 --> 04:36.308
I dropped this.
These suckers sure can roll.

04:37.143 --> 04:41.045
He climbed under the conference table!
Last week he tried to tackle you.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.947
His caseload is at ten percent
of what it should be.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.178
Whatever we're doing to rehabilitate...

04:46.252 --> 04:49.153
We've taken away his car,
slashed his expense account.

04:49.222 --> 04:52.191
Eli will reclaim
his rainmaker status momentarily.

04:52.258 --> 04:54.886
Why should we have to pay him
during his drought?

04:54.961 --> 04:58.727
We've been through this. It's built
into the autism case settlement.

04:58.831 --> 05:00.196
We can't fire him.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.730
- I found a loophole.
- Impossible.

05:02.835 --> 05:06.703
The settlement language is impenetrable.
Eli redlined it himself.

05:06.773 --> 05:09.139
Obviously, we can't be expected
to continue

05:09.242 --> 05:12.609
to employ someone who is
mentally or physically ill,

05:12.712 --> 05:14.976
or under the influence
of drugs or alcohol.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.777
Eli's not any of those things.

05:16.849 --> 05:20.012
There's really only one way
to find out for sure, isn't there?

05:22.989 --> 05:24.286
This has got to stop!

05:24.357 --> 05:28.453
They were all staring at me like
I was Carrie at the prom. You know...

05:28.528 --> 05:31.588
Sissy Spacek covered in pig's blood...

05:31.664 --> 05:33.529
...at her prom?

05:33.599 --> 05:35.567
Get it on Netflix. The point is,

05:35.668 --> 05:38.364
I'm giving new meaning
to the term "office faux pas. "

05:38.438 --> 05:40.929
One of the first things
a prophet sacrifices

05:41.007 --> 05:42.372
- is his ego.
- I'm a lawyer,

05:42.442 --> 05:44.967
not a prophet! Would it help
if I wrote it down?

05:45.044 --> 05:47.410
You think of yourself
as a dude losing his mind,

05:47.480 --> 05:50.005
- rather than a messenger of God?
- Absolutely.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.211
- Is that still an option?
- Not if you want this vision to stop.

05:53.286 --> 05:57.154
Look what happened the last times.
Take the right case, the visions stop.

05:57.223 --> 06:01.091
That's what I thought, but I checked
the client roster, no Private Swain.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.323
There's no Swain Private
Financial Group. There's no Swain.

06:04.397 --> 06:06.160
I even spelled it different ways.

06:06.232 --> 06:09.360
I don't think it's as easy
as running a computer search, Eli.

06:09.435 --> 06:12.768
- Moses didn't have Google.
- You play the Moses card a lot.

06:12.839 --> 06:16.002
I'm just saying, if the soldier
wants you to take a ridge,

06:16.109 --> 06:17.872
maybe that's where the answers are.

06:17.944 --> 06:21.505
That would sound more convincing
without "if" and "maybe. "

06:21.614 --> 06:24.981
Vision interpretation
isn't an exact science, Eli.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.679
But, everything will
reveal itself in time.

06:28.888 --> 06:32.380
- You've gotta have...
- Don't finish that sentence.

06:32.458 --> 06:33.755
I don't believe it.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.989
- My own fiancée double-booked me.
- She's running a little late.

06:37.096 --> 06:40.463
I'm running late. Her meeting
should have finished a half-hour ago.

06:40.566 --> 06:44.662
You know how these custody fights
drag on. Poor kid.

06:45.872 --> 06:47.999
- Thanks, Emily.
- Oh, sure.

06:59.352 --> 07:02.253
They still publish Bloom County?

07:02.321 --> 07:06.348
I love that comic.
I'm a sucker for talking penguins.

07:10.129 --> 07:15.465
That's grim. That's what ten-year-olds
are reading these days, I guess.

07:15.535 --> 07:18.026
I'm 12.

07:18.104 --> 07:22.666
Oh... well, you won't mind if
I borrow the funnies then, will you?

07:25.445 --> 07:27.106
It's gonna be OK.

07:28.681 --> 07:31.844
No offense, but you don't know
what you're talking about.

07:32.718 --> 07:33.776
That's fair enough.

07:34.987 --> 07:36.955
- Thank you very much.
- Welcome.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.787
Brian, you have to stop
reading that stuff.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.918
I want to go home. Are you done yet?

07:41.994 --> 07:46.761
Soon, soon. I promise. Just hang tight
for a sec. Where are the restrooms?

07:46.833 --> 07:48.460
Down at the end of the hall.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.535
Who's that?

07:55.608 --> 07:58.907
The reason we're not having lunch.
Custody battle.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.247
- She's in the Army.
- National Guard, actually.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.284
- She's serving a tour in Iraq.
- You're representing her.

08:05.351 --> 08:07.717
- Please tell me that.
- No, I've got the father.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.787
Oh...

08:08.888 --> 08:11.857
It's not the best week for this,
but the case is simple

08:11.924 --> 08:13.221
and therefore quick.

08:13.292 --> 08:17.922
Mrs. Swain is a private in active duty,
no court is gonna grant her custody.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.521
What's wrong?

08:20.533 --> 08:22.364
Nothing. It's just...

08:23.069 --> 08:26.232
The woman you're up against in court

08:26.339 --> 08:28.398
is Private Swain.

08:41.754 --> 08:45.315
Do you get here early so you can
lie in wait by the elevators?

08:45.424 --> 08:47.688
- Oh, my God, you do.
- We need to prep.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.785
- Our motion's in two days.
- "Our motion"?

08:49.862 --> 08:53.161
The one you'll help me win.
You understand this is do or die for me?

08:53.232 --> 08:56.099
- Right. Where do I send the flowers?
- Ha ha. Hilarious.

08:56.168 --> 08:59.035
I pulled relevant cases,
law review articles, and...

08:59.105 --> 09:02.040
I've got your Trial Advocacy seminar
from last summer.

09:02.108 --> 09:06.067
- Looks like someone lost some weight.
- Desperation disguised as flattery.

09:06.145 --> 09:09.046
- You'll miss me if I'm gone.
- I doubt it, let's find out.

09:09.115 --> 09:12.482
- You go that way.
- Here. Try not to get a hernia.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.712
What is all this stuff?

09:13.819 --> 09:16.151
Budget and contract
for your engagement gala.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.554
I think "gala" is a bit
of an exaggeration.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.353
One-hundred-and-fifty guests,

09:20.426 --> 09:24.988
a 12-piece orchestra, three ice
sculptures. That's a "gala. " Look it up.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.622
Larry Conover didn't call?

09:26.699 --> 09:29.759
He says he doesn't want
or need your help on his case.

09:29.835 --> 09:32.395
No way is he telling you
which court room it's in.

09:32.471 --> 09:35.440
- Call Taylor's assistant, find out...
- Done.

09:35.508 --> 09:38.170
They're in Judge Simms' court
this morning.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.872
Patti, is your enthusiasm
related to me telling you

09:40.947 --> 09:43.438
I may be going against Taylor
in court this week?

09:43.516 --> 09:47.384
- What's a gala without fireworks?
- Right. Did you get those cases?

09:47.453 --> 09:49.819
Winston, Barra and Potter,
all on your chair.

09:51.223 --> 09:52.884
- Eli Stone?
- Yeah.

09:55.995 --> 09:58.020
You've been served.

10:05.771 --> 10:09.867
- Jordan wants me to take a physical.
- And a drug test.

10:09.942 --> 10:14.242
This may be the first time the partners
have done something I understand.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.317
Why won't you let me help?

10:19.385 --> 10:22.115
Other than the fact you stole
Beth Keller from me?

10:22.188 --> 10:25.089
I'm not going to steal this client,
I want to be co-counsel.

10:25.157 --> 10:27.318
Why, did you nail this one
back in college too?

10:27.426 --> 10:29.758
How did you...
did you really just say "nail"?

10:29.829 --> 10:32.957
Ms. Keller told me about
your dorm room afternoon delight,

10:33.032 --> 10:35.523
- when she fired me.
- Which I feel badly about.

10:35.601 --> 10:38.468
And as part of my mea culpa,
I'm offering my expertise.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.835
Which I'm declining. The answer is no.

10:40.906 --> 10:43.568
I'll see you. Never. Hopefully.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.779
The court can't grant
sole custody to a parent

10:47.847 --> 10:50.315
working in a war zone 7,400 miles away.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.613
That's a lie, Your Judge.
I mean, Honor...

10:52.685 --> 10:55.347
She's on limited leave.
She goes to Iraq by week's end.

10:55.421 --> 10:59.653
And if it would please the court,
that would not be the case if...

10:59.725 --> 11:01.818
When you grant
my client sole custody.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.192
Military isn't granting
hardship discharges

11:04.263 --> 11:06.197
except in the case of extreme hardship.

11:06.265 --> 11:09.928
When there's a second parent ready,
willing and able to assume custody,

11:10.002 --> 11:12.971
- that's simply not the case.
- Larry...

11:13.072 --> 11:17.008
Mr. Conover, I am not granting
sole custody to a parent

11:17.076 --> 11:22.241
who, by virtue of her military service,
can't care for her child.

11:22.314 --> 11:23.804
Mr. Conover?

11:25.117 --> 11:26.550
Hello?

11:26.619 --> 11:28.348
Well, Your Honor,

11:28.421 --> 11:32.289
do the names Winston, Barra
and Potter mean anything to you?

11:32.358 --> 11:33.518
Not at all.

11:34.927 --> 11:36.690
In that case, Your Judgeship,

11:36.762 --> 11:39.890
my co-counsel, Mr. Stone,
can speak to that point.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.424
What the hell are you doing, Eli?

11:43.502 --> 11:47.131
Your Honor, I direct attention to
the discharge applications of soldiers

11:47.206 --> 11:49.572
Lisa Winston, Scott Barra,
Douglas Potter...

11:49.642 --> 11:51.405
Did you go to college with her too?

11:51.477 --> 11:52.739
I'm his fiancée.

11:52.812 --> 11:55.906
All Guard personnel in similar
situations who were granted...

11:55.981 --> 12:00.008
Those aren't precedent. The military
makes determinations case-by-case.

12:00.086 --> 12:03.214
All we're asking is Specialist Swain
have her day in court,

12:03.289 --> 12:07.157
which happens to be one of the rights
she's been fighting to preserve.

12:07.226 --> 12:10.389
Fair enough. We'll proceed
with the custody hearing.

12:10.463 --> 12:14.729
I'll stay my ruling pending disposition
of the hardship discharge application.

12:18.337 --> 12:21.170
- Honey, I can explain.
- Don't "honey" me, Eli!

12:21.240 --> 12:22.332
We've got a problem.

12:22.408 --> 12:26.435
Mr. Stone, I would like to discharge
Mr. Conover and hire you.

12:26.512 --> 12:28.480
- See?
- But we're co-counsel.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.550
I can't afford two attorneys.
And even if I could...

12:31.617 --> 12:33.778
I'm sorry, Larry. You're a sweet man.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.821
But I need a lawyer who's not sweet.

12:37.690 --> 12:40.250
You know, this can't be
a good trend for my practice.

12:42.528 --> 12:44.359
What the hell are you thinking?

12:44.430 --> 12:47.593
If you want more time with me,
this is not the way to do it.

12:47.700 --> 12:51.136
I know, I'm sorry. I didn't want
to take the case, but I had no choice.

12:51.203 --> 12:54.536
- My dad made you take it?
- No, not your dad.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.440
I can't explain it.
I know my timing couldn't be worse.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.808
The case was supposed to be over, Eli.

12:59.879 --> 13:03.315
I was gonna spend this week
preparing for our engagement party.

13:03.382 --> 13:06.715
- Now I'm fighting you in court.
- Worried? You're four-and-two.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.084
- Five-and-two.
- Counting Hilty?

13:09.155 --> 13:11.783
Hung jury goes to the defendant.
Honestly, is it

13:11.857 --> 13:15.020
a passive-aggressive way
of ruining our engagement party?

13:15.127 --> 13:17.687
"Ruining"? No!
This'll be totally romantic.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.493
- Remember the Grant trial?
- I remember spanking you.

13:20.566 --> 13:23.330
Do you remember what happened
outside of court?

13:23.435 --> 13:25.335
Adversarial sex.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.933
Eli, this case is important to me.

13:29.008 --> 13:32.842
OK? It's why I took it pro bono.
This kid belongs with his father.

13:32.912 --> 13:36.609
Besides, I'm not sure your self-esteem
can recover from two and six.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.843
I can recover if you can.

13:53.499 --> 13:57.560
I kind of need a ride.
Your dad took my car.

13:57.636 --> 13:59.126
Get in.

14:01.674 --> 14:05.906
You're totally screwed. They want
a CAT scan, an MRI. Can you fight it?

14:05.978 --> 14:08.742
If I oppose, the partners
will know something wrong.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.715
They watched you climb under
a table during a meeting.

14:11.784 --> 14:15.652
That particular ship may have sailed.
Besides...

14:15.721 --> 14:17.484
...maybe this is all for the best.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.423
What? Going public with my aneurysm?

14:20.492 --> 14:23.325
Losing my job, my malpractice insurance,
my career...

14:23.395 --> 14:26.228
Dad didn't know about his aneurysm,
drank his life away.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.129
You can be different, do something.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.690
I'm doing what I want to do.

14:29.768 --> 14:32.931
The only thing that stops me
from thinking I'm turning into Dad

14:33.038 --> 14:36.974
is going into work every day,
and I need you to help me keep doing it.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.576
- Oh, no.
- What?

14:40.646 --> 14:42.580
We used to forge Mom's signature!

14:42.648 --> 14:46.084
In junior high. And this isn't a note
to get you out of gym class!

14:46.151 --> 14:50.315
A month ago, you didn't know about my
aneurysm. Just pretend it's a month ago.

14:50.422 --> 14:53.323
I'm not risking my license
to try and help you save yours.

14:53.392 --> 14:57.351
And maybe this cutting back on work,
maybe this isn't such a bad thing.

14:58.998 --> 15:02.559
- So you're not gonna help me?
- Eli, I am helping you.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.110
Iraq changed everything.

15:14.179 --> 15:18.616
Felicia... her unit
got called up 24 months ago.

15:18.684 --> 15:22.120
She came back on leave and...
I don't know who this woman is anymore.

15:22.187 --> 15:26.749
She wants to separate,
she wants a divorce, fine.

15:26.825 --> 15:29.293
Brian's grades are dropping.

15:29.361 --> 15:33.593
He ditches school.
He runs away.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.931
Two full nights,
his father had no idea where he was.

15:37.002 --> 15:39.869
Which could have easily happened
if Felicia was home.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.804
My son is at risk.

15:41.874 --> 15:45.640
He needs a stable, competent parent
in his life. And he needs it now.

15:46.645 --> 15:48.135
Your witness.

15:51.650 --> 15:55.916
So you're saying Brian doesn't have
a stable, competent parent in his life.

15:55.988 --> 15:58.548
- I'm saying he needs his mother.
- Not if his mother

15:58.624 --> 16:01.957
- suffers from post-traumatic...
- Objection, facts not in evidence.

16:02.027 --> 16:04.188
Sustained.

16:04.263 --> 16:06.993
- Specialist Swain, have you ever...
- Objection.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.330
To what? I didn't even
get my question out.

16:09.401 --> 16:13.030
She was gonna ask if my client has been
treated for post traumatic stress.

16:13.105 --> 16:16.006
Because he guessed
what I was gonna say, does not give...

16:16.075 --> 16:18.441
Knock it off, you two, or get a room.

16:18.544 --> 16:21.104
I understand you're both under
a lot of pressure

16:21.213 --> 16:24.114
- with your big gala...
- Why does everyone call it a gala?

16:24.183 --> 16:27.675
Bottom line, keep your personal mishegas
out of my courtroom,

16:27.753 --> 16:30.722
or I'll find other attorneys
for your clients.

16:30.789 --> 16:34.919
It's gonna be fine. All you do is answer
whatever questions you get asked.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.656
Don't worry, because no one
is gonna ask you

16:37.730 --> 16:39.755
who you want to be with.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.494
Just tell the truth.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.695
It's the easiest thing to remember.

16:44.770 --> 16:48.604
- Does my dad have to be there?
- Yes.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.142
That's his right, Brian.

16:52.544 --> 16:55.513
Listen, sweetie, why don't you
go find yourself a snack?

16:56.081 --> 16:59.244
We have a kitchen downstairs.
Lot of junk food.

17:03.555 --> 17:05.420
Go easy.

17:09.461 --> 17:12.896
It would've been nice to know you
were engaged to my husband's attorney

17:12.964 --> 17:14.522
before I hired you.

17:14.633 --> 17:19.194
I was gonna mention it,
but you fired Larry so quickly, and...

17:19.271 --> 17:22.035
Believe me, you're getting
my A-game here.

17:25.577 --> 17:28.842
Oh, by the way,
did you look at the phone bills?

17:28.914 --> 17:33.749
- Phone bills?
- Yeah, I gave them to Larry.

17:33.819 --> 17:36.982
There was a 911 call from the house.

17:37.089 --> 17:40.058
That kind of thing
never happened when I was home.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.300
Hey...

17:54.373 --> 17:57.001
- Why are you at my desk?
- I'm getting a feel for it.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.341
Plus, the Ketwilder motion?

18:00.412 --> 18:03.176
You're shepherding me?
None of this rings a bell?

18:03.282 --> 18:06.740
It does, sadly. I was just trying
a wish-it-away kind of thing.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.684
Yeah. It didn't work.

18:08.754 --> 18:13.088
Look, I'm already in the process of
disappointing two women this week. So...

18:13.158 --> 18:15.524
- I heard.
- You heard or you snooped?

18:15.594 --> 18:19.291
I inquired. You, your fiancée,
arguing in front of Judge Simms.

18:19.364 --> 18:23.733
- And not just arguing, but arguing.
- I have some real, actual work to do...

18:23.802 --> 18:25.360
I need a strategy for my motion.

18:25.471 --> 18:28.235
Do I rope-a-dope,
or go for the straight knockout?

18:28.340 --> 18:32.401
- Well, whatever you do, keep it brief.
- Brief. Right.

18:32.478 --> 18:35.003
Succinct. I'm all about brevity.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.048
I need to go cut 15 pages
out of my filing.

18:46.892 --> 18:49.383
Get over here, private!
We gotta take that ridge!

18:49.461 --> 18:51.326
You keep saying that. Why?

18:51.396 --> 18:52.954
Those are our orders!

18:53.031 --> 18:55.499
- I'll cover for you!
- All right, listen up.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.933
I'm gonna lay down cover fire,
you follow me.

18:58.036 --> 19:00.937
- On my count! You got it?
- Haven't I engaged enough?

19:01.006 --> 19:03.133
Why don't you tell me what's going on?

19:03.675 --> 19:07.771
Incoming! It's a grenade!
Pick it up and throw it, private!

19:07.846 --> 19:09.746
Pick it up? You pick it up!

19:09.815 --> 19:12.249
I'm imagining you picking it up.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.844
This is so not real!

19:18.490 --> 19:21.425
Eli? What are you
doing under my desk?

19:21.493 --> 19:24.462
Patti, I was just plugging the...

19:24.530 --> 19:26.498
...unplugging the... it's better.

19:27.399 --> 19:29.264
Could you get Dr. Chen for me?

19:29.334 --> 19:34.271
Yeah, I'm thinking I should just
go ahead and put him on speed dial.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.670
Yeah.

19:38.443 --> 19:41.276
This should not be happening.
I enlisted!

19:41.346 --> 19:44.713
I'm saving Private Swain
through litigation.

19:44.816 --> 19:47.512
So why did my office
just turn back into Iwo Jima?

19:47.586 --> 19:49.611
I never said that's exactly
how it works.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.748
You did. You said if I took the case
there'd be a ceasefire.

19:52.824 --> 19:56.191
- Obviously, I was wrong.
- Nice to know before I sued my fiancée.

19:56.295 --> 19:59.594
Maybe there's more to this vision
than just case.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.223
It wouldn't be the first time.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.461
How about acupuncture
to bring clarity?

20:03.535 --> 20:05.560
OK. But this time better be free.

20:05.637 --> 20:09.505
I'm still mad at you. And I used up the
ten sessions covered by my insurance.

20:10.075 --> 20:12.009
Relax. Close eye.

20:12.077 --> 20:15.342
What's with the accent?
There's no one else here.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.882
Habit. Get me in the mood.

20:24.556 --> 20:28.322
We... we gotta get McCullin
off that ridge.

20:28.393 --> 20:31.954
- Who's McCullin?
- Nazis...

20:32.064 --> 20:35.830
- The Nazis got him trapped.
- Are we playing war? Cool!

20:36.702 --> 20:40.468
- Hurley, Dixon, lay down cover.
- What should I do, Dad?

20:40.572 --> 20:42.335
Private Stone, listen to me.

20:42.441 --> 20:46.935
You stay here, you don't move, and you
suppress fire. Do you understand me?

20:48.513 --> 20:51.209
I'll move on McCullin... on three!

20:52.918 --> 20:54.408
Dad...

20:56.221 --> 20:57.984
You're all good men.

20:59.491 --> 21:01.049
Dad?

21:02.661 --> 21:06.153
What happened? What did you see?

21:06.231 --> 21:08.062
It was...

21:08.634 --> 21:10.192
This was a mistake.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.433
The worst part?

21:13.538 --> 21:15.472
I guess it's...

21:15.540 --> 21:17.872
...being worried all the time.

21:19.578 --> 21:23.639
Being worried that something
will happen to my mom.

21:23.715 --> 21:26.809
- Sometimes, it's all I can think about.
- So, what do you do?

21:27.853 --> 21:30.219
There must be someone
that you can lean on.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.554
- Objection. Leading.
- He's a minor, Your Honor.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.115
I'll allow it.

21:35.193 --> 21:38.651
My dad. He's around.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.425
He's the only one there.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.433
Thanks, Brian.

21:47.539 --> 21:51.305
Brian, let's talk about the times
you didn't want to talk to your dad.

21:51.410 --> 21:55.437
September 24th, was that
one of the times that you ran away?

21:56.882 --> 22:00.010
Yeah. My dad and I had a fight.

22:00.085 --> 22:03.145
It seems like more than a fight,
from your phone records.

22:03.221 --> 22:05.348
Objection! I haven't heard
about records.

22:05.424 --> 22:08.985
Counsel has access to the records I do.
I obtained them this morning.

22:09.061 --> 22:12.497
You two could be your own reality show.
Continue, Mr. Stone.

22:12.564 --> 22:15.624
September 24th, Brian...
did you call 911?

22:18.737 --> 22:21.069
Did you call 911 and hang up?

22:21.139 --> 22:23.505
It's OK if you did.
People do it all the time.

22:23.575 --> 22:26.043
Yeah, I dialed it by mistake.

22:26.111 --> 22:28.272
On the same night
you ran away from home?

22:31.083 --> 22:33.017
What happened on that night, Brian?

22:34.119 --> 22:38.488
Brian, you know, we're all here
to figure out what's best for you.

22:39.224 --> 22:42.193
OK? Everyone in this room.
You understand that, right?

22:45.430 --> 22:47.796
- I guess.
- Brian,

22:47.866 --> 22:51.597
you need to tell the truth
about why you called 911.

22:58.143 --> 23:02.409
- I did it because I was hurt.
- How did you get hurt?

23:02.481 --> 23:04.711
Did somebody hurt you?

23:10.989 --> 23:13.219
Where did you get those bruises, Brian?

23:13.291 --> 23:16.158
Brian! Brian, don't.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.197
Instruct the respondent
to remain seated, or I'll do it.

23:19.264 --> 23:20.731
Sit down, Mr. Swain.

23:20.799 --> 23:23.859
- Your Honor, we'd like a recess.
- Not until I get an answer.

23:23.935 --> 23:27.029
Brian, who did this to you?

23:30.976 --> 23:32.534
My dad.

23:34.646 --> 23:36.409
Why didn't you say something?

23:36.515 --> 23:39.484
I thought maybe I was being paranoid.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.651
I didn't want to believe
that Robert was capable of that.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.153
Brian's OK.

23:49.227 --> 23:51.593
The doctor's looking at him right now.

23:51.797 --> 23:54.857
There will probably be
a criminal investigation.

23:58.136 --> 24:01.833
The good news is, I think you'll
be getting full custody.

24:02.574 --> 24:05.509
I can't see that going
any other way right now.

24:06.211 --> 24:08.475
- You stooped!
- I got the records this morning!

24:08.547 --> 24:11.277
It's a breach of ethics,
springing something like this.

24:11.349 --> 24:13.909
You're angry because
you're representing a bad guy.

24:13.985 --> 24:16.818
- You don't know my client.
- Well, I... Hey Bill, Sheila!

24:16.888 --> 24:20.324
- Hey, so glad you guys made it.
- Want to see you on the dance floor.

24:20.392 --> 24:23.020
I know that your client
beats his son. Nice.

24:23.094 --> 24:26.928
Those bruises could have been
from football. I spoke to his coach.

24:26.998 --> 24:30.764
He gets three kids a week, sends them
to the nurse with bruises like this.

24:30.869 --> 24:33.394
The 12-year-old is a liar.
That's your defense?

24:33.472 --> 24:35.963
I told you this case
was going to be a disaster.

24:36.041 --> 24:37.770
I could have given you a heads-up.

24:37.843 --> 24:40.505
- Is that an apology?
- For taking the case, sure.

24:40.579 --> 24:42.410
Not for revealing this slime...

24:42.481 --> 24:44.449
Eli, is that an apology?

24:45.283 --> 24:48.946
- Yes. I'm sorry.
- Good.

24:57.462 --> 24:59.930
Listen, about the other day...

25:00.632 --> 25:03.192
- Are we good?
- Why wouldn't we be?

25:03.268 --> 25:07.034
It's not like you wouldn't do something
that, if positions were reversed,

25:07.138 --> 25:10.266
I would do for you, because that's
what being brothers means.

25:10.342 --> 25:13.470
OK. So long as you're not
holding on to any resentment.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.509
What the hell is she doing here?

25:19.284 --> 25:22.117
- Oh, who's that?
- That's Beth Keller.

25:22.187 --> 25:25.088
Former client, the autism case.
We knew each other...

25:25.156 --> 25:28.125
Wait... Beth? Brunette Beth from UCLA?

25:28.226 --> 25:31.161
The Beth that was your first... at-bat?

25:33.899 --> 25:38.165
- Wow. Who didn't you invite?
- I didn't invite her!

25:38.236 --> 25:41.603
I... I didn't even see the list.
I have no idea how she...

25:44.409 --> 25:47.708
I'm gonna kill her.
Justifiable homicide.

25:49.614 --> 25:51.980
- Hi.
- Beth! I'm so glad you could make it.

25:52.050 --> 25:55.213
Thanks. I was a little surprised
to get the invitation, but...

25:55.320 --> 25:57.481
- How's Ben?
- He's good. He's good.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.184
I got him in a new school! Yay!

26:03.895 --> 26:05.920
Tell me the truth.
Is it weird I'm here?

26:05.997 --> 26:10.331
What? No. Absolutely not.
It's not weird at all.

26:15.974 --> 26:18.943
I'm Nate. Eli's brother.

26:19.010 --> 26:22.173
- The one that's not completely lame.
- I'm sorry.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.408
- Beth, Nate. Nate, Beth.
- Hi.

26:24.516 --> 26:26.882
- Hi.
- You know what? You guys should dance.

26:26.952 --> 26:29.921
Seriously. He's got mad skills
on the dance floor.

26:29.988 --> 26:31.717
- Mad...
- Skills?

26:38.930 --> 26:42.195
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I was expressing my opinion.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.758
You should be aware
of what else is out there.

26:44.836 --> 26:46.133
At my engagement party?

26:46.204 --> 26:48.502
It's not like I invited her
to your wedding.

26:48.573 --> 26:51.599
You think I'm letting you have
anything to do with the wedding?

26:51.676 --> 26:53.906
Mission accomplished.

26:59.184 --> 27:02.210
We love you, honey.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.721
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

27:04.789 --> 27:07.485
I promised your father
I wasn't gonna cry,

27:07.559 --> 27:10.119
so I think I'm just gonna
give you the mike now.

27:13.031 --> 27:16.398
My daughter is
an amazing young woman.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.800
And she has made me
so happy and proud

27:18.870 --> 27:22.431
every single day of her life.

27:22.507 --> 27:26.136
We couldn't be more pleased she found
someone who appears to do the same.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.804
- I have presided over many mergers...
- Oh, no...

27:37.288 --> 27:38.448
- Move!
- Got your back!

27:38.556 --> 27:40.524
Soldier! Get down here!

27:45.563 --> 27:48.327
- Good job, soldier! We got that ridge!
- We did?

27:48.400 --> 27:51.460
Good, because I got
an engagement party to get back to.

27:51.536 --> 27:52.867
That's the rally point!

27:52.937 --> 27:55.235
We took the ridge,
now there's a rally point?

27:55.306 --> 27:58.469
Do you know George Michael?
He usually just shows up and sings.

27:58.576 --> 28:01.272
- It's a whole lot safer!
- I'm gonna pop some smoke!

28:01.346 --> 28:04.474
You make a run for it!
Lt'll be all right.

28:04.549 --> 28:06.915
Go! Go!

28:07.452 --> 28:08.976
Go!

28:47.125 --> 28:48.615
So...

28:49.594 --> 28:53.121
Best engagement party ever?
Huh? Anyone?

28:53.198 --> 28:54.756
No?

28:54.866 --> 28:58.324
"Hey, Nate, why don't you make
some coffee?" That's a great idea.

29:00.338 --> 29:02.272
- I'm sorry.
- Don't.

29:03.775 --> 29:05.072
Don't apologize.

29:09.147 --> 29:11.638
Is this what
it was like with your father?

29:12.650 --> 29:14.277
A little.

29:14.352 --> 29:16.843
I don't recall him
diving into any pastries.

29:21.659 --> 29:24.127
Like we don't have
enough problems this week.

29:24.195 --> 29:26.220
I am sorry, Taylor, for all of it.

29:27.398 --> 29:29.161
Yeah, so am I.

29:31.336 --> 29:34.396
I should get back to my parents.

29:34.472 --> 29:38.101
I'm sure they're wondering
what happened in the "emergency room. "

29:38.176 --> 29:41.543
- What did you tell them?
- Commitment makes you faint.

29:42.847 --> 29:44.815
You wouldn't be the first guy.

29:53.391 --> 29:54.483
You OK?

29:57.028 --> 29:59.121
Not accounting for the fact I demolished

29:59.197 --> 30:03.224
what was supposed to be the best night
of her life, I'm doing pretty good.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.571
Am I gonna be the worst husband ever?

30:07.639 --> 30:09.971
Fortunately, Dad already
locked up that title.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.440
Hmm. Why do you think Mom stayed?

30:15.747 --> 30:17.305
She loved him.

30:18.883 --> 30:20.976
All right, here you go.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.749
Engagement present.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.754
You're gonna sign my physical now?
After what you just saw?

30:27.826 --> 30:31.660
I heard what Taylor said about whether
this is like what Dad was like.

30:31.729 --> 30:35.563
And it's not. You are not him, Eli.

30:35.633 --> 30:38.761
You're my brother and I'm not
gonna let you become like him.

30:38.837 --> 30:42.000
And to prove it...

30:42.106 --> 30:43.971
...I'm going out on a limb with you.

30:44.976 --> 30:46.841
I've got to do something.

30:46.911 --> 30:50.347
At 10:30? I usually only make
appointments during business hours.

30:50.415 --> 30:54.647
I don't usually dive into cakes,
especially at my own engagement party.

30:54.719 --> 30:57.984
Denial's not just a river,
it's also a lousy coping strategy.

30:58.056 --> 31:01.685
- You want to finish the flashback.
- No. But I need to.

31:01.759 --> 31:03.590
I can't afford not to.

31:03.828 --> 31:06.319
Come on, you want me
to paint you a target?

31:16.507 --> 31:17.872
Eli, wh...

31:19.644 --> 31:20.941
What happened?

31:31.789 --> 31:33.256
Give me the gun.

31:34.826 --> 31:37.386
You'll get in trouble.
Give me the gun.

31:37.462 --> 31:39.487
I'll tell them it was me.

31:46.604 --> 31:49.164
Good boy... son.

31:55.980 --> 31:58.073
I took the gun.

31:58.149 --> 31:59.844
What gun?

32:00.818 --> 32:05.278
My dad shot a hole in the wall
during one of his episodes.

32:05.356 --> 32:08.917
I took the gun from him and told my mom
and the police that I did it.

32:09.027 --> 32:10.961
You lied to protect him?

32:11.029 --> 32:14.192
That's not something a parent
should ask any child to do, Eli.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.096
He didn't ask. He didn't have to.

32:18.069 --> 32:21.527
I didn't want to lose him
or have my mom kick him out.

32:21.606 --> 32:25.303
It's too much responsibility
for a child, Eli, to lie to the police.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.583
You're right.

32:32.684 --> 32:35.312
No child should be put in that position.

32:37.188 --> 32:39.622
Private Swain, we need to talk.

32:45.797 --> 32:49.028
I think there's a chance,
a strong possibility,

32:49.100 --> 32:53.161
that your husband and your son
are perpetuating a fraud on the court.

32:53.237 --> 32:55.102
- Perpetuating a fraud?
- Both of them.

32:55.173 --> 32:58.233
The bruises, the abuse claims,
the angry denials.

32:58.309 --> 33:01.244
They're lying to get the judge
to give you custody.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.780
You get sole custody,
you get discharged,

33:03.848 --> 33:05.907
and you won't have to go back to Iraq.

33:07.151 --> 33:09.915
I know it sounds crazy because it is.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.149
They could not be making
a bigger mistake.

33:12.223 --> 33:15.989
The DSS is recommending criminal
charges. Robert could go to jail.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.823
- I know.
- You know what?

33:19.931 --> 33:22.593
- All of it.
- You know?

33:22.667 --> 33:26.228
Everything I said up there
on that stand was true.

33:26.337 --> 33:29.101
Brian is falling apart.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.834
I can't reassure him anymore.

33:30.908 --> 33:33.399
Every day I'm over there, my odds...

33:33.478 --> 33:35.776
...of coming home alive get worse.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.008
Felicia, there are options.

33:38.116 --> 33:40.676
- Legal avenues...
- I've been down them all.

33:40.785 --> 33:42.514
Over and over.

33:42.587 --> 33:44.452
I have petitioned my sergeant,

33:44.522 --> 33:48.982
my commander, my congressman
and my president for a discharge.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.391
They don't care.

33:50.461 --> 33:53.828
So you filed for divorce
and went after sole custody?

33:53.931 --> 33:57.833
We had to make it look real.
Like a family in distress.

33:57.902 --> 34:00.530
After all my letters,
we knew they'd be suspicious.

34:00.605 --> 34:03.904
- So you came up with abuse?
- It was our only way out.

34:03.975 --> 34:07.308
Brian banged himself up pretty bad
on his skateboard one day, and

34:07.378 --> 34:11.746
while Robert was putting ice on the
bruises, the whole thing came to him.

34:11.815 --> 34:14.444
And then they came to you?

34:14.518 --> 34:17.681
It took me a couple of days
to come around,

34:17.755 --> 34:21.384
- but eventually, we called lawyers.
- Who you proceeded to lie to.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.585
You took advantage of me.

34:24.661 --> 34:27.130
Oh... doesn't feel very good, does it?

34:27.899 --> 34:30.264
Your son committed perjury.

34:30.368 --> 34:33.804
And... and Robert, does he
understand the sacrifice he's making?

34:33.871 --> 34:36.567
- He could go to prison.
- The way he sees it,

34:36.641 --> 34:38.905
eventually he'll get out,

34:38.976 --> 34:41.274
but I may never come home.

34:41.344 --> 34:45.714
I still have to deliver my closing
argument tomorrow, and...

34:45.783 --> 34:48.911
...I can't knowingly lie to the court.
- Mr. Stone...

34:50.487 --> 34:53.719
Nothing has changed.

34:53.791 --> 34:57.352
I hired you because
I need you to fight for me,

34:57.428 --> 34:59.862
to fight for my son, for my family.

35:18.249 --> 35:20.376
This case is about family.

35:20.451 --> 35:24.888
It's about these two parents
and their precious boy, not about Iraq.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.083
I will point out that all we have

35:27.158 --> 35:30.423
are the emotional accusations
of a very troubled boy.

35:30.495 --> 35:34.056
That evidence tells us
that Brian Swain needs help.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.497
From his father,

35:35.600 --> 35:37.864
from his mother,

35:37.935 --> 35:39.766
from every one of us here.

35:57.188 --> 35:58.621
She's absolutely right.

35:59.557 --> 36:02.526
Brian could be lying.
Those bruises could be from a fall,

36:02.593 --> 36:06.256
from a fight with another kid,
skateboarding accident.

36:06.330 --> 36:11.165
Because, as Ms. Wethersby said, the only
thing we know, with absolute certainty,

36:11.235 --> 36:13.396
is that Brian Swain is in crisis.

36:13.504 --> 36:17.804
And he's been in crisis since his mother
shipped off to a war without end.

36:17.875 --> 36:22.335
Now, Brian is either being abused
by his father or he's lying.

36:22.413 --> 36:25.678
Either way, that father's
not getting the job done.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.775
Brian needs his mom.

36:27.852 --> 36:32.289
Whether you agree that Felicia Swain
promised to serve indefinitely or not,

36:32.356 --> 36:35.086
she volunteered to join the Guard.

36:36.794 --> 36:38.659
Brian Swain didn't.

36:56.013 --> 36:59.244
Whatever happens, you're still
the best lawyer I know.

37:00.685 --> 37:03.245
- Nice try.
- About the party...

37:03.321 --> 37:05.255
Not now, Eli.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.792
It's never gonna stop, is it?

37:13.731 --> 37:15.562
The craziness?

37:16.834 --> 37:18.392
I don't know.

37:20.004 --> 37:22.063
The judge has a decision.

37:26.677 --> 37:30.613
The standard in this case
is the best interest of the child.

37:30.681 --> 37:34.344
I can't, in good conscience,
award custody to a parent

37:34.418 --> 37:37.854
who is under the shadow
of an allegation of abuse.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.891
Brian Swain will be placed
in the care of his mother.

37:40.958 --> 37:45.691
The court will advise the National Guard
of our ruling. I expect Felicia Swain

37:45.763 --> 37:49.130
will be discharged from her service
with all deliberate speed.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.869
Please stand up, Mr. Swain.

37:59.543 --> 38:01.238
Hands behind your back.

38:17.895 --> 38:19.453
You wanted to see me, sir?

38:19.530 --> 38:21.054
Come in.

38:29.407 --> 38:30.965
I got your physician's report.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.169
Congratulations on
a clean bill of health.

38:33.244 --> 38:38.910
I noticed the examining physician's name
is also Stone. Small world.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.416
Microscopic, sir.

38:42.353 --> 38:45.618
Perhaps it was a mistake to assume
that if I took away your car,

38:45.690 --> 38:48.523
- your expense account...
- My chair.

38:48.592 --> 38:52.255
You also took my chair.
It was ergonomic.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.628
It seems petty and wrong

38:54.699 --> 38:56.860
to assume that
the removal of a few perks

38:56.967 --> 39:00.198
would have you toeing the line
like a recalcitrant puppy.

39:00.271 --> 39:04.037
Listen, Eli, whatever crisis
you may be going through,

39:04.108 --> 39:06.599
your effect on this firm
will be marginal.

39:08.245 --> 39:10.110
Your effect on my daughter...

39:10.181 --> 39:12.479
I love Taylor.

39:12.550 --> 39:15.246
I would never do anything to hurt her.

39:15.319 --> 39:17.981
Look at that. Common ground.

39:19.290 --> 39:21.451
With that in mind,
I'm going to ask you once,

39:22.426 --> 39:27.056
and if I find out you're lying to me,
it will forever alter our relationship.

39:29.266 --> 39:32.133
Is there something
really wrong with you?

39:36.507 --> 39:41.069
No, sir. I'm perfectly healthy,
just like the form says.

39:42.346 --> 39:46.214
Are we done? Because...
I kind of have a bus to catch.

39:47.618 --> 39:48.778
Yes. We're done.

39:59.697 --> 40:04.031
Another bread maker. What is it about us
that says "we love bread"?

40:06.837 --> 40:08.532
Guilty conscience?

40:08.606 --> 40:12.906
- I still feel bad about the party.
- Is that it?

40:12.977 --> 40:14.706
Or do you feel guilty that

40:14.779 --> 40:18.545
Robert's going to jail even though
he was trying to protect his wife?

40:18.649 --> 40:20.810
How did you?

40:20.918 --> 40:23.478
- Why would you think?
- You didn't condemn him.

40:23.554 --> 40:25.784
You condemned the situation.

40:25.856 --> 40:28.347
You were threading the needle.
You knew something.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.291
Privilege.

40:32.396 --> 40:34.921
How about that boy?

40:35.599 --> 40:37.499
True love, huh?

40:37.568 --> 40:39.866
Can you imagine
doing that for someone?

40:43.174 --> 40:45.608
Yeah.

40:45.676 --> 40:47.974
I did something like that
for my dad, once.

40:49.046 --> 40:50.411
I used to wonder...

40:52.082 --> 40:54.346
...why didn't Dad just leave, you know?

40:54.418 --> 40:57.478
Why'd he have to stay

40:57.555 --> 40:59.489
and make our lives suck so much?

41:01.225 --> 41:03.785
- You're not your father, Eli.
- I know.

41:05.996 --> 41:07.520
He stayed...

41:08.833 --> 41:10.960
...and inflicted himself on us.

41:16.574 --> 41:19.008
I don't think I can
do that to someone else.

41:23.013 --> 41:26.847
Or God forbid, a family.

41:31.689 --> 41:36.319
- I guess what I'm saying is...
- No! No, don't do this, Eli.

41:36.393 --> 41:38.827
Look at me.

41:38.896 --> 41:40.796
This is simple.

41:43.467 --> 41:46.630
- Do you love me?
- You know that I do.

41:47.972 --> 41:51.237
But I can't... I can't put you through
what my dad put us through.

41:53.544 --> 41:55.307
I love you too much for that.

42:00.251 --> 42:02.378
Maybe you
just don't love me enough.

42:06.757 --> 42:08.657
This is the right thing to do.

42:10.628 --> 42:12.391
Yeah.

42:12.496 --> 42:14.327
It sure feels right, doesn't it?
