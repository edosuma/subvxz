Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.000 --> 00:07.402
<i>- Love brought me to Mystic Falls.</i>
- I <i>love you, Damon.</i>

00:07.560 --> 00:08.891
<i>Love drove me away.</i>

00:09.040 --> 00:10.804
- Silas.
- Hello, my shadow self.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.040
<i>Just when we thought we were safe...</i>

00:15.360 --> 00:16.521
Gregor.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.001
<i>...our enemies took everything.</i>

00:20.160 --> 00:21.924
I'm not ready to be dead yet, Jeremy.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.880
I can tell people you're with family.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.520
I may not be able to touch you,
but I'm here for you.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.286
- Our lives...
- What are you doing to my brother?

00:29.440 --> 00:31.807
- I'm frying Silas' brain.
- Ugh!

00:32.119 --> 00:35.283
- Stefan, we missed you.
- I have no idea who you people are.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.807
<i>...and even our memories.</i>

00:43.120 --> 00:46.203
"March 12, 1922.
I blacked out for days.

00:46.360 --> 00:50.922
I wake up in a stranger's blood, in places I
don't recognize with women I don't remember.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.889
I feel alive again."

00:54.440 --> 00:56.408
All right. I think I've read enough.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.491
- Nada?
- I know nada means nothing.

01:00.640 --> 01:03.849
I know what day and year it is,
I know this car has a V-8 engine...

01:04.040 --> 01:08.602
and yet I'm two journals deep, and I
have absolutely no memory of who I am.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.091
Brutal.

01:10.240 --> 01:13.289
- Is this supposed to fill me up?
- Yes and no.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.125
- Technically, yes, because you're a vampire.
- Weird.

01:16.280 --> 01:19.887
- Realistically, no, because you're you.
- Ah, yes.

01:20.040 --> 01:23.522
The insatiable and blood-lusting vampire
Ripper of Monterey.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.648
And we're only in the 1920s, baby.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.442
Well, sorry, but this is a lot to process.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.886
You are a vampire.
Not a caveman.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.006
So let me get this straight.

01:36.160 --> 01:40.722
I helped you steal this car, I found out I
was a vampire who killed his own father...

01:41.320 --> 01:43.004
and yet I don't litter.

01:43.200 --> 01:47.444
You're a man of principles, Stefan, who had
his memories erased by a 2000-year-old witch.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.683
I bet that 2000-year-old witch
probably drives faster than you.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.844
Wait, let me guess.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.365
Fun brother.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.521
Safe brother.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.362
- What are you doing?
- Do you trust me?

02:03.880 --> 02:05.609
- Do I have a choice?
- Nope.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.811
I got it.
You're the fun brother.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.241
Whoo.

02:42.480 --> 02:47.008
Please tell me I wasn't out of my mind leaving
Damon in charge of Vampire Amnesia 101.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.844
What did he say, exactly?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.128
One text. "So far, so good."

02:51.280 --> 02:55.808
- Which in Damon-speak...
- Means they probably devoured Girl Scouts.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.850
- Caroline.
- I'm kidding. Kind of.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.210
Although it's not uncommon
for patients with retrograde amnesia...

03:03.360 --> 03:05.931
or other traumatic brain injuries
to turn volatile.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.522
Okay, Dr. Forbes. Since when
do you know so much about amnesia?

03:09.680 --> 03:12.763
It's possible I've studied up
on my Chem, Bio-Chem...

03:12.960 --> 03:16.203
Applied Micro Bio, Molecular Bio
and <i>Grey's</i> Anatomy.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.328
The real one and the television show.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.801
- You did all that for Stefan?
- Of course <i>I did.</i>

03:21.640 --> 03:24.246
And I'm also trying to
impress Dr. Maxfield.

03:24.400 --> 03:28.405
<i>I figured if I could get closer to him,
I.e., into his Biology class...</i>

03:28.600 --> 03:32.321
maybe I can figure out why he covered up
our roommate's murder-by-vampire.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.010
And it's also possible
that I have a study buddy.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.804
Hi, Dr. Maxfield.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.288
Are you ready to go study, Jesse?

03:44.200 --> 03:49.889
Jesse? Dr. Maxfield's incredibly hot, funny,
and miraculously single lab assistant?

03:50.800 --> 03:54.282
I'm dragging him to our hometown
graveyard bell-ringing ceremony.

03:54.440 --> 03:56.681
As in, creepy first date?

03:56.880 --> 03:58.484
As in a study date.

03:58.640 --> 04:03.885
I might as well ring a bell for Tyler and me
considering our relationship is on its deathbed.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.646
- See you Monday, doc.
- Stay out of trouble.

04:06.800 --> 04:11.522
Will I see you there? You can bring Stefan.
It is ironically called Remembrance Day.

04:11.680 --> 04:17.449
I hope so. Depends how Stefan's handling
the download of his dark and stormy past.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.567
All right. Talk to you later.

04:21.839 --> 04:25.686
- To Uncle Steve!
- Uncle Steve!

04:25.840 --> 04:28.127
- All right.
- Yeah! Wow.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.602
This town always upbeat
about dead people?

04:32.760 --> 04:35.206
In the theme of morbid town tradition...

04:35.360 --> 04:38.762
you go back to the 1820s when people
were so paranoid about cholera...

04:38.960 --> 04:42.851
that they would occasionally bury a body
a wee bit before its time.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.049
So we have a holiday
dedicated to burying people alive?

04:46.200 --> 04:49.602
They were so paranoid, they would request
to be buried with a string...

04:49.760 --> 04:51.762
attached to a bell above ground.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.161
And the family hung around the grave
for 24 hours...

04:54.320 --> 04:57.483
in hopes of hearing the bell
and their loved one would come back.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.928
But now it's just a kick-ass excuse
to get hammered.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.491
<i>Heh.</i>

05:03.280 --> 05:05.647
- Hello.
- Hey.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.566
We'd love another round, please.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.889
- You got it.
- Yeah.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.683
- What the hell was that?
- That, my brother...

05:20.880 --> 05:24.123
was you jonesing for something stronger
than a blood bag.

05:24.280 --> 05:28.126
What's the problem? You were trying to
convince me I'm a vampire. I'm convinced.

05:28.280 --> 05:32.285
- Let me act like one.
- There are two types of vampires in the world.

05:32.440 --> 05:36.081
There are those that can handle moderation,
and then there's you.

05:36.560 --> 05:39.882
- Well, I'm no shrink. Right?
- Right.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.931
But maybe killing our father,
and turning you into a vampire...

05:44.080 --> 05:47.926
and all the trauma associated with that
is what made me become a vampire...

05:48.080 --> 05:50.208
who rips people's heads off.

05:50.360 --> 05:53.967
But now that I don't have
all those memories and all that guilt...

05:54.160 --> 05:56.367
maybe the Ripper thing
won't be a problem.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.090
Let's not try it out, okay?

06:00.360 --> 06:05.082
And here I thought catching up on
nearly two centuries would be a drag.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.481
Remind me of your name again.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.447
- Elena.
- Elena. Right.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.685
You haven't told him about me?

06:15.840 --> 06:17.649
Two hundred years is a long time.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.771
Right.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.570
Well...

06:27.400 --> 06:29.482
<i>Now you know
Yeah you got my back against the wall</i>

06:29.640 --> 06:33.770
<i>Oh, God
I ain't got no other place to hide</i>

06:33.920 --> 06:35.445
Don't stop on my account.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.729
<i>Like a sitting duck
Just waitin' for the fall</i>

06:39.200 --> 06:41.680
Sorry, I, uh, just went for a run.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.165
- What are you doing here?
- It's not like there's Netflix.

06:45.320 --> 06:49.370
You working out is my main source
of entertainment.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.522
I was working off the extra adrenaline.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.603
And every girl on the Other Side
thanks you for it.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.125
Is this our new thing?

06:58.280 --> 07:02.524
You make dead jokes while I avoid
all our friends on your behalf.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.570
There's nothing I can do
to get Stefan's memory back, Jeremy.

07:05.720 --> 07:09.281
They don't know that
because they don't know you're dead.

07:10.360 --> 07:13.842
They're waiting for you to help them
because that's what you do.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.526
- You help.
- What happened to you being there for me...

07:16.680 --> 07:20.002
- ...and my decisions?
- I want to, Bon, but...

07:20.560 --> 07:21.971
not like this.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.162
- Hey.
- Hey, Jer.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.604
You got a sec?
Um, I'm kind of freaking out here.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.809
Yeah, what's going on?

07:39.240 --> 07:43.245
So I woke up last night
covered in mud, with this.

07:43.440 --> 07:46.364
- Okay. Weird.
- Yeah, I know.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.841
I have no idea where it came from.
I blacked out.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.121
And I'm pretty sure it's
not the first time.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.800
How many times have you died
wearing the Gilbert ring?

07:54.960 --> 07:57.008
I don't think it's the Gilbert ring.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.965
It has to do with
why Silas couldn't mind-control me.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.003
He saw something or someone...

08:03.160 --> 08:05.891
or whatever that Czech freak
put in my head.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.244
But I think it's still there.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.364
What's with the camera?

08:16.520 --> 08:19.126
I set them up to help me figure out
how I'm losing time.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.130
Have you talked to Bonnie? She's the only
person who might know what's going on here.

08:24.280 --> 08:27.602
Yeah, she's in D.C.
with her mom or something.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.809
So she can't pick up?
I sent her, like, 300 e-mails this summer.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.371
And she writes back twice.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.845
Did I piss her off?

08:35.000 --> 08:38.208
I don't know.
She hasn't mentioned anything.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.931
Jer, I need you to help me
get in contact with her.

08:41.559 --> 08:44.086
I haven't slept. Okay?

08:44.240 --> 08:45.480
I'm scared I'm going crazy.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.810
I need her help.

08:48.440 --> 08:52.161
- Okay, I gotta go.
- What? Where?

08:54.120 --> 08:56.600
So, Mr. So-Far-So-Good.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.202
Mr. I-Can-Handle-My-Brother.
Mr. I-Know-What-I'm-Doing.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.125
Hey. I never said I know what I'm doing.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.691
Mm.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.888
- Who are you calling?
- Bonnie.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.930
A witch did this to him,
maybe a witch can undo it.

09:12.080 --> 09:15.402
I'm on top of it, sister. I've called her.
She hasn't called me back.

09:15.560 --> 09:19.884
I say until she does,
let's just let Stefan be Stefan.

09:20.040 --> 09:25.206
Fun, carefree, drunk Stefan. Without 100
years' of vampire guilt on his shoulders.

09:25.360 --> 09:29.410
That guilt came from a blood addiction
that might still be hardwired in his brain.

09:29.560 --> 09:33.167
You take one philosophy class, now you're
the queen of nature versus nurture?

09:35.720 --> 09:37.290
Where'd he go?

09:38.920 --> 09:41.844
You don't see that cute,
little waitress anywhere, do you?

09:52.720 --> 09:54.370
Don't scream.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.130
Don't move.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.244
I don't wanna hurt you.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.084
You seem really nice.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.251
And it's not like I wanna
rip your head off.

10:08.760 --> 10:12.845
But I keep being told
that if I have one taste...

10:14.280 --> 10:16.248
I won't be able to stop.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.760
And although the thought of killing you...

10:23.960 --> 10:26.201
scares the hell out of me...

10:26.720 --> 10:29.451
this feeling of hunger
that I have inside of me...

10:30.120 --> 10:32.487
it's so much more powerful.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.290
Today, I'm the safe brother.

10:48.240 --> 10:50.083
What kind of name is Honoria Fell?

10:50.240 --> 10:52.686
Shh. You're the one that killed her.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.166
Oh.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.001
Hindsight being 20/20...

10:57.160 --> 10:59.561
way too much temptation at the bar.

10:59.760 --> 11:04.163
If this Ripper gene is biological,
we need to minimize human contact...

11:04.320 --> 11:08.405
till we get your brain all witchy-wooed
back to normal. So here it is.

11:09.560 --> 11:13.121
- So this is the, uh, family crypt, huh?
- Mm-hm.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.605
Anybody here I didn't kill?

11:15.760 --> 11:19.048
Well, we've covered our father,
who art in hell.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.961
Uncle Zach, my bad. On the bright side...

11:24.160 --> 11:26.040
- ...our mother died of consumption.
- Oh, good.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.045
Ooh.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.682
I gotta go see a man about a witch.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.643
Party on without me, brother.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.124
For you.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.884
This is for you.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.731
Well, I, uh...

11:45.880 --> 11:48.804
I certainly hope your family history
was happier than mine.

11:48.960 --> 11:53.761
Well, let's see. In the last three years,
I lost my adoptive parents...

11:53.920 --> 11:58.721
my birth parents, my aunt, our guardian
Alaric, and my brother Jeremy died.

11:58.880 --> 12:02.885
Although he came back to life,
so there's that.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.247
Wait, Jeremy that lives in our house.

12:05.400 --> 12:10.645
Yeah, after I had a breakdown
and burned my house to the ground.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.643
- Hm.
- Heh.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.167
- What?
- How do I not remember you?

12:16.120 --> 12:18.885
I mean you're smart, you're pretty,
you're funny.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.566
Obviously you're the strongest
woman in the world...

12:21.760 --> 12:25.003
if you managed to figure out a way
to get through all that.

12:27.400 --> 12:30.847
I surround myself with amazing people
who help me through it.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.644
Like you.

12:35.520 --> 12:39.491
- You're one of those people.
- So bonded by death.

12:40.480 --> 12:43.962
Please don't tell me
that we met in a cemetery.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.364
Really? We met in a cemetery?

12:47.520 --> 12:49.204
Eh, ha-ha-ha.

12:49.360 --> 12:53.524
Well, no, officially we met
somewhere else first, but, um...

12:54.280 --> 12:56.521
- You wanna see?
- Yeah, sure.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.400
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Jeremy Gilbert picks up.

13:01.520 --> 13:04.410
Wow, it's a Remembrance Day miracle.
Now, tell me you found Bonnie...

13:04.560 --> 13:08.281
because I have a hungry vampire
who forgot that he's the hero of the story.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.251
I need you to come meet me.
And I need you to come alone.

13:12.400 --> 13:16.325
- I need you to be less vague and less weird.
- I <i>know</i> where Bonnie is.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.684
Get over here and I'll explain.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.051
- Unh.
- Mm.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.247
- Anything?
- No. Sorry.

13:32.280 --> 13:35.284
Actually, I think you were coming
from that direction because...

13:35.440 --> 13:38.046
I remember looking that way.
So maybe if we switch.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.690
Sure.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.044
Right.

13:51.720 --> 13:54.530
- This is where we collided.
- Mm.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.051
Let's try again, shall we?

13:58.200 --> 14:02.171
Hey, Elena. As frustrating as it is
for me not to have any memories...

14:02.360 --> 14:05.091
I really don't think
that re-creating the time we met...

14:05.280 --> 14:07.567
is magically gonna bring it all back.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.803
Yeah, no... Right, I'm sorry, I...

14:14.840 --> 14:18.242
It's just that seeing
you like this is so...

14:18.400 --> 14:21.165
- ...strange.
- I'm strange?

14:21.320 --> 14:25.803
You were the one coming out of the mens'
bathroom. Do I even wanna know why?

14:28.240 --> 14:31.562
Let's just say that I was having
a pretty horrible first day.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.443
Face-plant.
- Good joke.

14:36.680 --> 14:37.727
It's not too bad.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.089
- I want to show you something. Let's go.
- Yeah, sure.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.361
Close your eyes.

14:49.920 --> 14:54.005
- You close your eyes.
- Come on, Stefan. Trust me.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.644
All right.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.448
All right, you can open them.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.320
The view's great. Come on up.

15:08.760 --> 15:11.047
- How the hell do I get up there?
- Jump.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.451
Just push off
with every ounce of strength that you have.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.804
Okay.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.691
All right.

15:26.960 --> 15:30.123
Well, I have to admit, that was, uh...

15:30.320 --> 15:32.322
That was actually pretty amazing.

15:32.480 --> 15:35.723
You're the one who whooshed me
up to the top of a Ferris wheel once.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.564
Before I was a vampire.

15:37.720 --> 15:40.371
Right. You mean when we dated.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.201
I thought Damon hadn't gotten to that part.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.840
I may have amnesia, but I'm not an idiot.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.131
I'm a 164-year-old vampire
who went back to high school, so I'm, uh...

15:52.280 --> 15:54.442
I'm guessing
that had something to do with you.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.850
Yeah.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.004
And obviously we're not together anymore,
so I have a feeling...

16:00.160 --> 16:03.209
me ripping people's heads off
might've been a bit of a turn-off?

16:04.800 --> 16:06.962
Actually, no.

16:07.120 --> 16:10.442
You were the most compassionate
person I'd ever met.

16:10.600 --> 16:14.491
You hated the idea of hurting anyone.
The guilt would overwhelm you.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.971
You were always in control.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.005
So I bored you to death.

16:18.800 --> 16:22.247
No. Stefan, it wasn't you.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.050
It was me.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.168
Becoming a vampire...

16:28.320 --> 16:29.924
changed me.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.442
How did you become a vampire?

16:36.360 --> 16:37.850
Why don't I show you?

16:40.440 --> 16:42.761
- Meet me down there?
- All right.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.409
Togavirus. Go.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.928
Togavirus causes congenital rubella,
whatever that is.

17:04.119 --> 17:05.963
Okay, hotshot.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.481
Red Queen Theory.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.449
A theory often used to explain...

17:11.599 --> 17:14.410
the contradictory relationship
between predator and prey.

17:14.560 --> 17:19.202
And why does the supposedly weaker species
always stay one step ahead?

17:19.359 --> 17:21.089
The fear of extinction.

17:21.240 --> 17:25.962
The rabbit is faster than the fox
because the fox is chasing its dinner.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.646
- The rabbit's running for its life.
- Damn.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.326
If Maxfield doesn't let you in,
you can have my spot.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.682
How did you learn all that so quickly?

17:34.840 --> 17:38.003
Whenever anyone tells me I can't
do something, I prove them wrong.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.964
Is that why you invited me here?

17:40.160 --> 17:42.162
Prove to your boyfriend
you don't need him?

17:42.800 --> 17:46.521
I don't know where my boyfriend is.
That would require communication.

17:46.680 --> 17:50.730
And mutual interest. And respect, heh.

17:50.920 --> 17:55.448
And I invited you here
because you're smart...

17:55.600 --> 17:58.365
and you're nice and...

17:58.520 --> 18:01.444
I don't know, I just kind of wanted
to hang outwith you today.

18:06.880 --> 18:10.168
I think that guy's doing a keg stand
on his granddad's grave.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.367
What?

18:21.680 --> 18:26.049
I'm sorry, I just kind of wanted to do that
since move-in day.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.042
Aplastic anemia. Go.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.204
Aplastic anemia...

18:36.280 --> 18:37.327
Okay.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.531
Where is she? Call her.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.008
- Get her here.
- That's the problem, I can't actually call her.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.764
No one can.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.203
Please don't do this, Jeremy.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.166
I've been lying to everyone for months.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.169
And I can't keep lying...

18:59.360 --> 19:03.160
knowing that everyone's waiting for her
to swoop in and save the day.

19:03.320 --> 19:06.483
I don't speak crazy person, Jeremy.
You have to translate for me.

19:06.640 --> 19:09.450
Think about it, Damon. I was dead.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.849
I wasn't supposed to come back.

19:12.040 --> 19:16.364
Yes, exactly, the beauty of Bonnie magic,
which is what we need right now.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.726
You're not hearing me.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.128
Magic finds a balance.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.882
I'm not supposed to be here.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.724
- No.
- You can't just bring...

19:31.880 --> 19:35.601
somebody back from the dead.
There's always a price to pay for it.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.762
Don't say it, Jeremy. Don't you dare.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.641
She didn't show up to her dad's funeral,
Damon.

19:41.240 --> 19:44.323
Nobody has spoken to her all summer.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.361
Please, Jeremy.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.807
You say it,
everything in Elena's life goes to crap.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.286
Do you understand me?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.408
Everything changes.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.450
Do not say it, Jeremy.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.725
Don't.

20:01.520 --> 20:02.806
Bonnie's dead.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.450
Damn it, Jeremy!

20:10.240 --> 20:12.402
You realize what you just did?

20:13.640 --> 20:15.563
Why would you say that?

20:15.960 --> 20:17.610
I'm sorry.

20:19.240 --> 20:21.322
People need to know.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.482
How is it cosmically possible to get
into two accidents on the same bridge?

20:47.120 --> 20:49.851
I don't know. Maybe it was fate...

20:50.000 --> 20:52.082
drawing me back...

20:52.240 --> 20:54.322
saying that I cheated death
the first time?

20:54.520 --> 20:57.729
But if I was there both times,
then why didn't I save you both times?

20:57.880 --> 21:00.804
Because the second time,
you saved my best friend Matt.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.451
Because I asked you to.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.288
Ah. Got it.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.085
So I'm an idiot?

21:07.480 --> 21:10.962
No. You were the perfect boyfriend.

21:11.240 --> 21:14.642
You valued what I wanted,
even if it wasn't what you agreed with.

21:15.520 --> 21:19.241
Well, this is gonna take me a minute
to wrap my head around that.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.810
- Fair enough?
- It's working, you know.

21:27.360 --> 21:28.361
You're remembering?

21:28.720 --> 21:32.645
No, I mean this, whatever we're doing.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.850
The, uh, distracting, sublimating,
whatever you wanna call it.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.927
The urge to feed has settled.
I'm not hungry anymore.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.447
Good.

21:44.160 --> 21:49.929
Whatever monster I was capable of being,
I could see why I was different around you.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.088
You were never a monster.

21:52.240 --> 21:57.087
Elena, I saw my reflection in the mirror today.
I was scared of me.

21:57.240 --> 21:58.810
Well, you never scared me.

22:00.240 --> 22:03.722
The first time I saw you,
for what you were...

22:04.400 --> 22:06.209
I touched your face, like this...

22:08.200 --> 22:09.884
and I told you not to hide.

22:16.520 --> 22:17.931
Don't.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.927
I'm with Damon.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.530
You're with my brother.

22:45.080 --> 22:49.324
And neither of you thought
that was something I should know?

22:50.360 --> 22:53.443
We weren't hiding it from you.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.246
It's not that...

22:57.840 --> 22:59.080
Sorry, I just...

23:03.360 --> 23:06.330
And just like that the hunger returns.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.240
I'm sorry, Stefan.

24:04.760 --> 24:05.966
<i>Hello?</i>

24:12.520 --> 24:13.760
What the hell?

24:42.360 --> 24:43.725
Hello...

24:44.840 --> 24:46.444
<i>Matt Donovan.</i>

24:48.480 --> 24:50.608
<i>I'm the passenger inside you.</i>

24:51.400 --> 24:54.165
<i>I know you have many questions.</i>

24:54.320 --> 24:56.641
<i>But all you need to know...</i>

24:56.800 --> 25:00.771
<i>is that one day my friends
will come looking for this blade.</i>

25:01.640 --> 25:04.086
<i>Protect it at all costs.</i>

25:13.680 --> 25:15.887
<i>Or this will be your throat.</i>

25:30.560 --> 25:34.804
- Hey, where are you? I've been calling.
- I'm at <i>home.</i>

25:35.360 --> 25:37.442
I really need
to talk to you about something.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.490
- Damon, Stefan's gone.
- What? What happened?

25:40.680 --> 25:43.729
I told him about you and me and he just...

25:44.040 --> 25:46.327
He stormed off and said that he was hungry.

25:46.960 --> 25:50.407
Damon, there's an entire graveyard
full of people here tonight.

25:51.680 --> 25:52.886
Okay, I'm on my way.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.964
Stefan?

26:05.800 --> 26:09.168
Caroline Forbes, my best friend.

26:09.320 --> 26:12.164
- Wait, you recognize me?
- Well, I've studied pictures.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.084
You are much hotter in person.

26:15.320 --> 26:18.164
- Sorry, I'm a little drunk.
- Yeah.

26:18.320 --> 26:19.446
Yeah, I can see that.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.126
Are you okay?

26:21.280 --> 26:25.683
Well, if by okay you mean, uh,
heavily spiraling into Ripper oblivion...

26:25.840 --> 26:27.968
then, yes, I'm dandy.

26:28.280 --> 26:31.250
Keg stand got passed out, so I stole these.

26:31.440 --> 26:34.046
Hey, do you mind
just giving us a couple minutes?

26:34.200 --> 26:38.524
Probably a good idea. I can sense from here
you have a paper cut on your left hand...

26:38.680 --> 26:41.729
- ...and I wanna rip your entire arm off.
- Stefan.

26:41.960 --> 26:45.487
Go away. Hide. I'll find you.

26:50.160 --> 26:55.451
Look, I know that you're hungry,
but you don't do people, okay?

26:55.600 --> 26:57.011
It doesn't end well.

26:57.520 --> 27:00.524
What about blood bags?
Do you have any blood bags?

27:00.840 --> 27:03.366
Yes, in the car. Come with me.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.768
Hey, Caroline, it's Jesse.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.684
I don't know what's going on...

27:15.840 --> 27:20.846
but for some reason I'm in a crypt
in the cemetery and I have no idea why.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.650
There.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.082
That wasn't so bad, was it?

27:37.240 --> 27:38.765
I did it. I stopped.

27:38.920 --> 27:43.084
- I don't know what you are, man, but...
- I'm a Ripper. You know what that means?

27:43.320 --> 27:46.085
I can't stop feeding
until I rip someone's head off.

27:46.680 --> 27:49.286
But look at us, we're working it out.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.249
Let me out of here. Please.

27:51.520 --> 27:55.445
I know I should let you out.
I'm good, right? I'm compassionate.

27:55.960 --> 28:00.090
I live with this burning hunger inside
of me that allows me to stay in control.

28:01.760 --> 28:04.001
But what do I have to show for it?

28:04.880 --> 28:06.928
- Huh?
- I don't know you, man.

28:08.520 --> 28:12.605
I have no memories
because my brain was fried.

28:12.760 --> 28:16.765
My brother, who's been my brother
for 160-some-odd years...

28:16.960 --> 28:21.090
stole my girlfriend,
and my girlfriend let him.

28:21.960 --> 28:26.045
So you tell me...

28:26.200 --> 28:28.089
what's the point in being good?

28:36.920 --> 28:38.490
I've been knocking.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.608
Yeah, I noticed.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.809
- So you're not gonna believe this...
- Matt, wait.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.727
There's something I need to tell you.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.731
It's about Bonnie.

28:51.440 --> 28:54.250
What? Is she back?

28:58.600 --> 29:00.090
What, Jer?

29:01.640 --> 29:04.041
Stefan! Stefan, stop!

29:06.760 --> 29:10.446
This isn't you, okay?
You might not remember, but I do.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.083
You are better than this.

29:13.240 --> 29:16.050
You are not this person.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.481
I have to go.

29:17.640 --> 29:19.802
- What?
- I have to leave.

29:20.040 --> 29:21.326
Stefan...

29:26.040 --> 29:28.327
Oh, my God. Unh.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.811
Jesse?

29:29.960 --> 29:32.804
Jesse, drink this. You'll be okay.

29:33.560 --> 29:34.641
I'm sorry.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.689
I'm sorry I got you into this.

29:36.840 --> 29:39.286
I'm sorry I let you kiss me, when I...

29:40.880 --> 29:43.360
I'm just sorry.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.730
Stefan, there you are.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.689
We've been looking
everywhere for you...

29:52.480 --> 29:56.644
- What you doing there, brother?
- You know, just tying up a few odds and ends.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.325
Sure you wanna do that?

29:59.520 --> 30:02.000
Well, I know what I don't want.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.606
I don't want to be the person
in these journals anymore.

30:07.200 --> 30:10.647
I don't want to live in this house,
I don't want my brother's advice.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.644
I don't want to hear
how I supported you, Elena.

30:14.240 --> 30:18.040
And I definitely do not want
to continue this conversation.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.646
- Wait...
- Don't worry, I won't go on a Ripper binge.

30:21.160 --> 30:25.210
Besides, Caroline said she'd call me
every hour to make sure I was okay, and...

30:25.880 --> 30:27.211
I actually do trust her.

30:30.760 --> 30:31.841
But...

30:33.000 --> 30:34.889
I think we just got dumped.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.690
We need Bonnie.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.884
Why hasn't she called us back?
It's so unlike her.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.765
He can't stay like this.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.687
Elena, Bonnie can't help us.

30:48.560 --> 30:49.766
Did you talk to her?

30:49.920 --> 30:51.251
What did she say?

30:51.680 --> 30:54.365
There's gotta be something
that she can do, I mean...

30:55.080 --> 30:57.242
She'll figure it out, she always does.

31:02.040 --> 31:03.644
Bonnie's dead, Elena.

31:04.440 --> 31:05.726
What?

31:06.240 --> 31:07.810
She's dead.

31:10.760 --> 31:11.921
I'm sorry.

31:24.240 --> 31:25.571
<i>Hey-</i>

31:26.240 --> 31:27.651
How are you feeling?

31:29.600 --> 31:31.090
Feeling better.

31:32.600 --> 31:37.686
Which, in my world, means I haven't
committed homicide since I last saw you.

31:38.880 --> 31:40.723
Been doing a lot of thinking today.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.766
A lot of wandering around...

31:44.720 --> 31:48.486
and this seemed like
the most appropriate place to come.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.645
What's wrong?

31:55.320 --> 31:56.924
It's Bonnie.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.331
My friend.

31:59.720 --> 32:01.484
Our friend.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.124
She's dead.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.005
Uh...

32:17.960 --> 32:21.169
- What, uh...? What happened?
- Please don't ask.

32:21.320 --> 32:25.291
Because then I'm going to
have to try to come up with an answer...

32:25.440 --> 32:27.329
which means I
have to think about it.

32:27.480 --> 32:32.327
And then I'll start crying, and I'm afraid
that I might not ever be able to stop.

32:33.080 --> 32:34.491
Mm.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.810
I'm sorry, I...

32:47.960 --> 32:50.327
I wish that I could remember her.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.530
I don't know.

32:55.200 --> 32:58.568
Part of me just wishes
that I could trade places with you.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.842
Because without all the memories...

33:03.680 --> 33:06.047
maybe it wouldn't hurt so damn much.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.370
It's okay.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.331
It's not.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.330
I'm never gonna see her again.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.361
And I have no idea where Tyler is.

33:21.720 --> 33:25.884
I just got so used to them
being there all the time.

33:26.280 --> 33:30.251
And now what, I'm supposed to just
learn to move on without them?

33:30.440 --> 33:36.049
How do I do that when all I have is
this sadness and this anger and...?

33:36.240 --> 33:38.891
Me. You have me.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.601
Like you were there for me last night.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.720
Sounds like you're always there for me.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.723
So let me be there for you.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.085
Okay?

34:03.040 --> 34:04.087
<i>Hey-</i>

34:04.240 --> 34:06.083
I don't have any clothes.

34:06.400 --> 34:07.765
I have nothing to wear.

34:07.920 --> 34:12.083
I burned my house down
with all of my funeral clothes in it.

34:13.080 --> 34:18.643
I'm supposed to be strong. I'm supposed
to have learned how to handle this, but...

34:19.440 --> 34:21.043
I can't.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.608
I can't keep doing this, Damon.

34:25.239 --> 34:28.608
Stefan's gone. Bonnie's dead.

34:28.760 --> 34:33.083
She gave up her life so that I could have my
brother back, and I didn't even know about it.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.248
I know.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.768
I can't believe this is happening.

34:45.960 --> 34:48.281
I can't believe she's gone.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.643
I'm so sorry.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.644
I'm sorry.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.209
It's okay.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.409
They need this.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.809
I need this.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.251
We ring this bell in honor of Bonnie.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.929
In remembrance for her.

37:27.640 --> 37:30.291
I'm not sure what else to say.

37:35.040 --> 37:37.281
Say that I'm not going anywhere.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.968
Say that even though
they couldn't see me...

37:43.480 --> 37:45.482
I've been there the whole time.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.767
She says that she's not going anywhere...

37:57.800 --> 38:00.849
that she has been here all along.

38:01.000 --> 38:06.006
- Bonnie has watched you have the summer...
- The summer of your life.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.889
And I saw you happy.

38:13.960 --> 38:16.691
And I know you think now...

38:17.320 --> 38:19.926
that you can't have a normal life...

38:20.080 --> 38:23.323
- ...that you have to be here for everyone...
- That you have to be here for everyone...

38:23.480 --> 38:25.289
- ...but you don't.
- ...but you don't.

38:26.360 --> 38:28.761
Everyone will find their way.

38:28.920 --> 38:31.969
So you are gonna repack your things...

38:32.160 --> 38:37.371
you're gonna go back to college,
and you're gonna live it up.

38:43.840 --> 38:46.161
You didn't do anything wrong, Matt.

38:49.200 --> 38:53.888
You know, I would have sent you
300 e-mails back if I could. Heh.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.201
I miss you.

38:57.560 --> 38:58.721
- Caroline...
- Caroline...

38:59.960 --> 39:04.249
I watched you decorate that dorm room
like your life depended on it.

39:11.520 --> 39:15.002
And I know that college isn't...

39:15.200 --> 39:19.046
everything you expected
and that you...

39:20.040 --> 39:22.520
feel like somethings missing...

39:22.680 --> 39:23.920
but...

39:25.240 --> 39:26.890
Tyler.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.409
This is good.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.721
This is all I wanted.

40:05.400 --> 40:06.561
I'll be okay.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.607
We'll all be okay.

40:44.280 --> 40:46.408
Your vitals are normal.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.610
Don't sound so disappointed.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.009
Tell me about your night.

40:51.800 --> 40:54.963
Caroline Forbes took me to a party
in Mystic Falls. And then...

40:56.440 --> 40:58.647
It's kind of a big blank.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.289
I must have been really drunk.

41:01.440 --> 41:04.523
What's causing your memory loss
didn't come in a red cup.

41:06.520 --> 41:09.444
It appears you have vampire blood
in your system, Jesse.

41:09.840 --> 41:12.969
Which means you were either injured
to the point of needing to be healed...

41:13.120 --> 41:15.726
or someone wants
to turn you into a vampire.

41:16.440 --> 41:19.967
I'm guessing the former, and then I'm
guessing you were compelled to forget.

41:20.160 --> 41:23.004
- I'm sorry, what?
- It's nothing to worry about.

41:23.160 --> 41:25.441
The good news about having vampire blood
in your system...

41:25.480 --> 41:28.006
is that's step one
to creating a new vampire.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.724
This is step two.
