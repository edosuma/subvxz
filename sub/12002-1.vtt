Or you will spend the rest of
your life wishing you were dead

06:54.840 --> 06:58.765
And then just because
you've pissed me off

06:59.920 --> 07:02.571
I'll get nasty with that Amanda

07:12.960 --> 07:18.922
I'm beginning to suspect you of
being a fucking sausage jockey

07:20.360 --> 07:26.049
You would not believe the nasty
fucks I could send round to her

07:26.720 --> 07:30.406
And it would make you sick
to know what they would do

07:32.240 --> 07:34.607
And I wouldn't stop there Asif

07:35.640 --> 07:38.007

that job on Wardour St?

08:19.640 --> 08:20.243
I am

08:20.320 --> 08:23.005
He thinks you're prejudiced
against him because he's a Paki

08:23.040 --> 08:24.371
I thought he was from Syria

08:24.440 --> 08:25.885
He's from Iran. His wife's from Syria

08:25.920 --> 08:27.410

08:42.080 --> 08:43.320
Afghan

08:43.640 --> 08:44.880
I thought his name was Asif

08:44.920 --> 08:48.003
It means he's from Afghanistan, Jane

09:15.200 --> 09:20.366
I want you to have a nice buzz, boy,

...don't...

09:35.840 --> 09:37.922

The pain will get worse

09:41.680 --> 09:43.648
And you will die

09:49.360 --> 09:51.681
All this can end Asif

13:06.560 --> 13:07.846
Can we go with you?

13:07.880 --> 13:09.848
Not this time

13:11.040 --> 13:12.530
You ain't no player yet

13:16.120 --> 13:17.884
Why didn't we send the text ourselves?

13:17.920 --> 13:20.207
Then we'd be further along with all this

13:20.240 --> 13:23.801
It's not just about
the sending of the text

13:24.520 --> 13:28.206
It's about getting that dirty cunt
to accept being fucked

13:28.240 --> 13:31.005
We are fucking him Terence

13:31.120 --> 13:35.330
If he hadn't sent it himself
how could we rely on him?

13:35.360 --> 13:39.729
I think we went too easy on him.
We could've removed a few teeth

13:40.440 --> 13:41.805
Terence

13:41.920 --> 13:44.366
We've got to keep him looking normal

13:44.440 --> 13:45.771
Sirus will bolt

This time though

13:54.600 --> 13:56.523
I'm gonna get him

13:57.240 --> 14:00.130
He's not going to embarrass me again

14:01.240 --> 14:04.005
I don't just want the Paki's gear

14:04.040 --> 14:07.931

18:35.560 --> 18:38.609
Ok. What would you like
me to help you with?

18:38.640 --> 18:42.611
I was just wondering if
you and your wife could...

18:42.640 --> 18:44.165
She's not back yet

21:32.680 --> 21:34.170
It's not the money

21:34.400 --> 21:35.731

the package to you directly</i>

22:38.840 --> 22:39.807
<i>You alright?</i>

22:39.840 --> 22:43.208
<i>I'm fine. My uncle insists
on it being done this way</i>

22:43.280 --> 22:45.203
<i>Everything else is the same</i>

22:45.240 --> 22:48.084
Easy Terence. It's a good thing

22:48.120 --> 22:50.122
He's being a good boy

22:50.320 --> 22:52.322
We should have got his house bugged

22:52.360 --> 22:54.567
He'd never have checked

22:55.360 --> 22:57.044
He might have

23:06.960 --> 23:09.440
For fuck's sake, I haven't
even put the shopping away

23:09.480 --> 23:10.720
How long are they staying?

23:10.760 --> 23:13.650
As long as they need to.
Think of the money, babe

23:14.320 --> 23:15.731
How you doing, man?

23:15.760 --> 23:17.330
I missed you man

23:17.400 --> 23:19.243
Come on in

23:19.440 --> 23:23.081
Yeah man! Everything crisp?

23:23.120 --> 23:25.441
- Hello gorgeous
- Have a seat guys

23:25.520 --> 23:28.046
Sirus, when's the food gonna be here?

23:28.080 --> 23:28.922
Soon

23:28.960 --> 23:30.769
And when's our boy gonna be here?

23:30.800 --> 23:32.245
Imminently

23:33.120 --> 23:36.522
Got a little thing me and
my man here can boot?

23:36.560 --> 23:38.688
I'll sort you out a little taster

23:38.720 --> 23:40.210
It's alright babe

23:41.240 --> 23:42.571
Tea anyone? Coffee?

23:42.720 --> 23:45.041
Tea would be lovely. White, 2 sugars

23:45.120 --> 23:46.565
Tea please. 3 sugars

23:46.840 --> 23:48.922
Coming right up, boys!

23:51.600 --> 23:54.888
You've got a good girl there, you know

24:03.440 --> 24:04.885
Help yourselves

24:25.360 --> 24:26.691
Tea's up, boys

24:26.920 --> 24:29.002
I'll be in the bedroom if you need me

24:29.040 --> 24:30.201
Wahey!

24:30.240 --> 24:32.447
<i>If he needs me, not you</i>

24:34.280 --> 24:36.601
- 2 <i>chicken curries</i>
- <i>Chicken Madras</i>

24:36.920 --> 24:39.321
Can we have some of that
bread with coconut in it?

24:39.360 --> 24:40.407
Peshwari?

24:40.440 --> 24:43.603
No, just bread with coconut in it

25:15.160 --> 25:16.400
- Hey Asif
- Amanda

25:17.280 --> 25:20.011
You're sweating, darling. You alright?

25:20.080 --> 25:21.127
I'm fine

25:22.120 --> 25:23.042
Is Sirus here?

25:23.120 --> 25:24.565
Yeah, of course he is

25:25.160 --> 25:27.162
Welsh contingent's here an' all

25:30.360 --> 25:32.442
- Heyyy
- Alright man

25:34.160 --> 25:36.447
Hey, the main man's here

25:38.760 --> 25:40.205
My friends

25:40.520 --> 25:42.443
Someone is trying to kill us

25:48.360 --> 25:50.442
Someone's trying to kill us!

25:50.760 --> 25:52.285
This is not a joke!

25:52.400 --> 25:54.801
The police, they are in a car outside

25:54.840 --> 25:58.481
These men are coming for
the drugs <i>&</i> the money

25:59.040 --> 26:00.804
What the fuck is that?

26:01.000 --> 26:02.001
Tracking device

26:02.040 --> 26:04.850
There are 2 policemen in a car outside

26:05.000 --> 26:07.287
They do not intend to arrest anyone

26:07.360 --> 26:10.045
They come only to steal <i>&</i> to kill

26:11.840 --> 26:13.410
Are you being serious?

26:14.360 --> 26:16.761
Sirus. It's Priestly

26:18.080 --> 26:19.525
Oh fuck

26:20.720 --> 26:22.449
Who the fuck is Priestly?

26:22.480 --> 26:24.926
Oh fuck, I thought I got away from him

26:24.960 --> 26:27.884
They are coming after you Sirus,
and they said they would hurt Amanda

26:27.920 --> 26:30.207
Calm down for a minute

26:30.600 --> 26:32.329
If this is serious

26:32.760 --> 26:36.048
We might be able to
sort out your little problem

26:36.680 --> 26:40.730
When he gets back from the doctor he
says he's got 4 different types of cancer

26:40.760 --> 26:43.161
- He's riddled with it from the neck down
- Hang on

26:43.200 --> 26:45.407
What's the spade doing?

26:53.640 --> 26:55.483
Bag with the money in it?

26:55.960 --> 26:57.485
Not that big

27:02.360 --> 27:03.805
Fuck

27:04.560 --> 27:06.130
Just chill now man

27:10.280 --> 27:11.691
Keep the change

27:15.080 --> 27:17.970
Maybe they're picking up the whole stash

27:18.480 --> 27:20.687
Either way, I'm calling for backup

27:20.720 --> 27:22.165
<i>'NM, COW?</i>

27:22.240 --> 27:23.969
What are you going to tell them?

27:24.360 --> 27:25.805
Not them

27:27.920 --> 27:29.331
Curry's here lads

27:29.400 --> 27:32.609
We're gonna need a lot more
than fucking curry

27:33.200 --> 27:38.206
I think what we have in this bag
is gonna sort out your problem

27:41.840 --> 27:43.330
Fucking hell

27:46.520 --> 27:48.090
This is fucked

27:52.360 --> 27:53.646
Fuck

27:54.640 --> 27:56.244
<i>Do</i> I <i>smell cu...?</i>

27:57.200 --> 27:58.486
What the fuck?

27:58.520 --> 28:00.249
Er, yeah...

28:00.280 --> 28:02.681
Amanda, you must go.
It's not safe for you here

28:02.760 --> 28:04.649
Oh, it's not safe for me here?

28:04.680 --> 28:07.331
With all these big strong
men waving guns about?

28:07.360 --> 28:10.125
I've been thinking how much better
our living room would look...

28:10.160 --> 28:11.764
...all full of guns!

28:12.120 --> 28:14.202
Is that a fucking hand grenade!?

28:14.240 --> 28:18.723
No, love, it's just a lighter that
looks like one. My mum gave it me

28:18.760 --> 28:20.808
We're just taking a few precautions

28:20.840 --> 28:23.525
What did you do?
Did you piss off the Israelis?

28:23.560 --> 28:25.642
This is it, Sirus. I'm going

28:25.680 --> 28:27.967
None of this shit better
be here when I get back

28:28.000 --> 28:32.050
And to be quite honest,
I don't know if I am coming back

28:32.200 --> 28:34.407
Amanda, let Pari take you

28:34.480 --> 28:38.405
You can fuck off as well.
I thought you were alright

28:39.440 --> 28:41.044
This tea's lovely

28:49.840 --> 28:51.842
Shall we have her followed?

28:52.280 --> 28:55.523
This is not the time to be
thinking about girlies, Terence

28:55.560 --> 28:58.245
I was just thinking she might be useful

28:58.280 --> 29:02.251
I've been saved.
The Lord protects me from temptation

29:03.280 --> 29:06.443
I think I preferred you
when you were a nonce

29:15.680 --> 29:17.648
Good evening Mr Priestly

29:17.680 --> 29:21.685
<i>How would you like to owe me nothing,
and have a little fun at the same time?</i>

29:21.840 --> 29:23.205
I would like that very much

29:23.240 --> 29:26.483
Why don't you come round for a
cup of tea, and we can discuss?

29:26.520 --> 29:28.682
<i>There is no time for tea, you fuck</i>

29:28.840 --> 29:31.810
All of you, in the van, with all
your toys, on Leabridge Rd

29:31.840 --> 29:33.365
Yes, Mr Priestly

29:35.000 --> 29:36.365
What a cunt

29:37.640 --> 29:39.005
What a cunt

29:39.880 --> 29:41.689
Why do you talk to that man?

29:41.960 --> 29:43.610
Why you talk to that man?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.331
Because he's useful

29:47.040 --> 29:48.644
Because he's useful

29:51.400 --> 29:53.562
I wonder if he'll bring Boris along

29:53.800 --> 29:55.131
Where's Boris?

29:56.520 --> 29:57.487
Boris!

30:07.800 --> 30:11.691
Sirus, you're going to straighten up,
and then we're going to war

30:11.720 --> 30:13.961
Why don't we just do nothing,
and see what happens?

30:14.000 --> 30:17.163
They are going to kill us.
That is what is going to happen

30:17.200 --> 30:19.441
If they're doing this unofficially...

30:19.480 --> 30:23.007
...they won't want to get too many
other people involved, will they?

30:23.040 --> 30:25.361
Are you saying it's 4 against 2?

30:25.400 --> 30:26.765
I am, plus...

30:27.320 --> 30:28.924
...they probably don't know...

30:28.960 --> 30:30.564
...that we know what they know

30:30.600 --> 30:33.206
Pay attention Sirus!
This is what's gonna happen

30:33.400 --> 30:37.041
You're gonna take that tracker
and draw them in

30:37.120 --> 30:40.044
So if you know a place nice <i>&</i> quiet

30:40.120 --> 30:42.441
We will lead them there

30:42.640 --> 30:46.281
And then we will deal with the problem

30:49.480 --> 30:50.606
Movement

30:51.040 --> 30:52.280
Easy Terence

30:55.760 --> 30:57.683
He's going ahead to the stash

30:58.000 --> 30:59.764
We wait for the Ruskies

31:22.000 --> 31:25.049
Hello Mr Cunt. This is Mr Boris

31:25.160 --> 31:27.128
Gimme that. Stupid Chetnik

31:27.960 --> 31:31.169
Hello Mr Priestly. I'm very sorry
for the language of my associate

31:31.200 --> 31:32.929
What do you want us to do now?

31:32.960 --> 31:36.169
I would like you to park up
outside <i>35</i> Manor <i>Rd...</i>

31:36.280 --> 31:39.124
<i>...so that you can keep an eye
on number 22 for me. Got that?</i>

31:39.160 --> 31:40.924
And where is this Manor Rd?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.889
<i>It's the road opposite where you are!</i>

31:42.920 --> 31:44.046
Now get a move on

31:44.080 --> 31:45.320
Boris. Go. Drivel

31:51.400 --> 31:53.129
Ok. We're in the road now

31:58.000 --> 31:59.126
56...

31:59.320 --> 32:00.446
42...

32:00.800 --> 32:01.926
36...

32:02.720 --> 32:03.846
30... stop!

32:03.880 --> 32:05.848
Stop, you fucking idiot. Stop!

32:06.800 --> 32:08.450
You villager, Boris!

32:09.280 --> 32:10.406
Twat

32:10.800 --> 32:13.724
That wasn't the most
subtle entrance, was it!

32:13.760 --> 32:17.446
<i>You see that</i> house <i>with the
black motorbike outside?</i>

32:17.840 --> 32:18.966
Yes, I can see

32:19.160 --> 32:21.242
That's what you're to keep an eye on

32:21.280 --> 32:24.727
Don't make any kind of move
until I say so. You understand?

32:24.760 --> 32:26.205
Ok, Mr Priestly

32:28.240 --> 32:29.844
I hate that cunt

32:30.360 --> 32:31.566
I like cunt

32:31.800 --> 32:33.165
Cunt is good

32:33.560 --> 32:36.291
You are a fucking arsehole.
You know that?

32:37.400 --> 32:39.323
Arsehole is good too

32:43.360 --> 32:44.771
I'm not sure about this...

32:44.800 --> 32:47.041
Terence, why are we not moving?

33:07.560 --> 33:08.766
God willing

33:11.840 --> 33:14.002
You think he's gonna hold his nerve?

33:14.040 --> 33:17.169
Don't worry about his nerve.
We're gonna hold that

33:17.240 --> 33:19.129
He just might need a push

33:19.160 --> 33:20.161
We can do that

33:20.240 --> 33:23.050
Sirus doesn't realise how useful he is

33:23.120 --> 33:24.451
She's not picking up

33:24.480 --> 33:25.641
Ready Sirus?

33:26.080 --> 33:28.367
No. Course I'm not ready

33:38.280 --> 33:43.923
Sirus, you realise you can't actually
kill anyone with a handgun?

33:44.240 --> 33:45.969
That's just television

33:46.080 --> 33:47.161
What?

33:47.320 --> 33:49.209
This'll be alright, won't it?

33:49.240 --> 33:50.401
No it won't

33:50.480 --> 33:52.528
This is for you, Sirus

33:53.320 --> 33:56.688
You have to be careful where
you're pointing it, obviously

33:56.800 --> 33:59.326
See here, that's the safety catch

33:59.560 --> 34:00.846
See?

34:00.960 --> 34:06.444
It's probably best if you keep it in
the 'on' position for the forseeable

34:06.640 --> 34:09.723
I'll just keep this one
as a backup then, yeah?

34:10.480 --> 34:17.409
I don't think Amanda's gonna be pleased
if you go & blow your own cock off

34:17.840 --> 34:20.446
What are you guys gonna be carrying?

34:21.000 --> 34:24.686
Fuck me, have you had this on you
every time you've been here?

34:24.719 --> 34:28.167
Well this is London innit. Dangerous

34:28.719 --> 34:31.963
This place Asif'll lead us to,
is it fit for purpose?

34:32.000 --> 34:33.603
He said it's Tilbury Docks

34:33.639 --> 34:35.641
It's an abandoned warehouse
in the middle of nowhere

34:35.679 --> 34:36.806
No one goes there

34:36.840 --> 34:39.844
Tilbury. I like the sound of that.
Sounds Welsh

34:39.920 --> 34:42.366
I can'! believe we're just gonna
kill some police officers

34:42.400 --> 34:44.129
With extreme prejudice

34:44.199 --> 34:48.250
But don't worry. Bent coppers is
something we understand, back in Wales

34:48.280 --> 34:50.043
Now I'm overflowing with confidence

34:50.080 --> 34:52.481
That's the spirit, man

34:53.840 --> 34:58.164
Sirus, we need a separate car. They're
expecting us all to arrive in this car

34:58.200 --> 35:03.001
I know, I'm on it, mate.
She's just not picking up

35:11.600 --> 35:12.328
What I?

35:12.800 --> 35:14.928
Is that any way to speak
to your best customer?

35:14.960 --> 35:17.122
I know your number.
What do you want?

35:17.160 --> 35:19.242
<i>I just called for the pleasure
of hearing your voice</i>

35:19.280 --> 35:20.406
Fuck off, Sirus!

35:20.960 --> 35:21.927
I need a car

35:21.960 --> 35:24.406
What do you expect me to do about it?

35:24.440 --> 35:26.169
I was hoping you could get me one

35:26.200 --> 35:27.565
<i>What would I do that for?</i>

35:27.640 --> 35:30.325
I thought that was what
car companies did

35:30.360 --> 35:32.806
Not for cunts like you.
What do you want a car for?

35:32.840 --> 35:35.605
Oh come on, Jane, I need a car. Please

35:35.640 --> 35:36.766
Kiss my arse!

35:36.800 --> 35:38.609
<i>I'm not having you take...</i>

35:38.640 --> 35:42.611
...one of my cars round the <i>drug</i>
haunts <i>&</i> brothels of East London

35:42.760 --> 35:45.525
Your low opinion of me is really hurtful

35:45.560 --> 35:47.801
<i>Please, I need a car. Thomas Rd</i>

35:47.840 --> 35:50.207
Oh, fucking... 20 minutes

35:50.760 --> 35:51.841
Now fuck off!

35:51.880 --> 35:53.928
<i>And don't he late tomorrow</i>

35:58.560 --> 36:00.369
Ok, so seriously...

36:00.400 --> 36:02.880
What do I do when I get in the taxi?

36:02.920 --> 36:06.208
I think we need to stick together.
Convoy kinda thing

36:06.240 --> 36:10.211
How the fuck can anyone follow you
when you're driving at this speed!?

36:10.280 --> 36:15.320
How about we drop you off, sit in the
shadows <i>&</i> follow at a safe distance?

36:15.360 --> 36:16.600
Can you do that?

36:16.640 --> 36:19.166
What you saying?
You having a dig at my driving?

36:19.240 --> 36:22.130
Easy, Tony.
You won't even know we're there

36:22.160 --> 36:24.766
When you go past... we will follow

36:25.080 --> 36:26.491
Nice and easy. Right?

36:26.600 --> 36:28.921
Just try and be a bit discreet

36:28.960 --> 36:31.088
Otherwise there's no point
getting a separate vehicle

36:31.120 --> 36:33.600
He isl He's having a go at my driving

36:33.680 --> 36:35.808
I think what he's suggesting is that...

36:35.840 --> 36:41.609
...perhaps you might drive in the manner
of a law-abiding member of the public

36:42.360 --> 36:46.649
Yes Mr Priestly, we've seen 10 signs
for Tilbury. We're nearly there

36:46.680 --> 36:50.605
Look there's Tilbury.
Everywhere I see fucking Tilbury!

37:17.120 --> 37:20.567
Alright. There's the taxi.
Did anyone follow us?

37:20.600 --> 37:21.840
M, thankfully

37:21.960 --> 37:25.407
Due to my man's driving that
you were so quick to criticise

37:25.440 --> 37:28.091
I think you can safely say
no one has been following us

37:28.160 --> 37:30.527
Having a go at my driving,
though, wasn't he!

37:30.560 --> 37:33.962
Right. Better get in the cab then

37:34.560 --> 37:36.369
Got your shooters?

37:36.560 --> 37:37.686
Kind of

37:38.280 --> 37:40.886
I think you're gonna need a bag for that

37:42.400 --> 37:45.290
Now... we have this from swimming

37:45.680 --> 37:47.842
Cover that with a towel

37:47.920 --> 37:50.764
Remember, when Mr Safety Catch is off...

37:50.800 --> 37:53.167
...Mr Shotgun is not your friend

37:53.240 --> 37:54.685
Alright, ok

38:02.560 --> 38:03.925
You know what

38:04.120 --> 38:06.248
Shall we have a quick boot first?

38:07.360 --> 38:09.283
Small one, mind

38:19.520 --> 38:20.681
<i>1 w'!</i>

38:21.520 --> 38:22.965
Is that your phone?

38:23.000 --> 38:24.126
No

38:24.480 --> 38:26.403
Mine plays Dam Busters

38:27.280 --> 38:28.611
Is it your phone?

38:29.160 --> 38:30.127
No

38:30.880 --> 38:34.282
I have the William Tell Overture on mine

38:34.400 --> 38:36.289
Oh, I think it might be mine

38:36.880 --> 38:38.803
My arse is vibrating

38:42.000 --> 38:42.967
Hello

38:43.000 --> 38:47.927
Where on Thomas are you?
I've got this fucking car waiting

38:49.480 --> 38:51.721
Tilbury Docks, please

38:51.920 --> 38:53.684
<i>Uh, M, er...</i>

38:54.200 --> 38:57.807
You do realise we don't actually
know where we are going

38:58.120 --> 38:59.485
Ea$Y

38:59.800 --> 39:02.201
We just follow the car Sirus is in

39:02.360 --> 39:03.805
Alright

39:04.400 --> 39:06.323
But discreetly

39:11.600 --> 39:13.250
Tilbury Dock, yeah?

39:13.400 --> 39:14.845
Cheers mate

39:15.320 --> 39:18.688
Looks like you've been
having a heavy night

39:19.040 --> 39:22.089
Look, I don't want
any vomiting in the car

39:22.400 --> 39:26.325
I just had it all cleaned.
5 pounds extra, if vomiting

39:26.480 --> 39:28.801
Amblin Wharf. Don't talk, just come

39:28.960 --> 39:31.691
Where the fuck is Amblin Wharf?

39:31.760 --> 39:33.205
Cedar Rd

39:33.240 --> 39:34.526
Where?

39:35.680 --> 39:39.366
What are you doing in Cedar Rd
at this time of the night?

39:39.480 --> 39:41.164
Just family stuff

39:41.200 --> 39:42.884
Family

40:04.760 --> 40:10.130
Do you remember playing in the
poppy fields when we were 4 years old

40:10.320 --> 40:13.449
Collecting the opium for my father?

40:13.480 --> 40:16.290
I had no idea it was
turned into this powder...

40:16.360 --> 40:21.002
...that people in big shining
cities would kill for

40:21.160 --> 40:28.442
Then they came to Afghanistan to kill for
this dirty powder from a pretty flower

40:28.640 --> 40:31.803
People here don't even know
what the flower looks like

41:15.040 --> 41:17.805
...wife back in Pakistan, you know

41:17.840 --> 41:20.446
I tell her to stay there.
No point coming here

41:20.480 --> 41:23.450
Life is too hard here.
Why come to this place?

41:23.480 --> 41:27.371
- How far is this place?
- Not very far

41:28.240 --> 41:33.929
But she's still in Pakistan.
I'm finding girlfriend here now

41:34.000 --> 41:37.368
And get plenty jooking here

41:37.600 --> 41:42.527
I keep my jooking here & my wife
over there. That's the best way to do it

41:42.560 --> 41:43.686
What's flocking'?

41:43.720 --> 41:44.881
Jooking!

41:44.920 --> 41:46.763
You know what 'jooking' is

41:46.800 --> 41:50.600
You put it in, and you jooka jooka,
Jooka jooka, jooka jooka

42:11.240 --> 42:13.004
What you shoot?

42:13.120 --> 42:14.804
Man in car

42:15.240 --> 42:16.571
What car?

42:16.640 --> 42:19.484
You are just fucking wasted.
You are shooting at nothing

42:19.520 --> 42:21.648
- The car
- What you smoke?

42:21.680 --> 42:22.966
Smells like shit

42:24.280 --> 42:25.725
Smack and weed

42:26.000 --> 42:27.809
Why you waste good smack?

42:27.920 --> 42:29.684
Give to me

42:36.600 --> 42:39.968
Hello Mr Priestly.
We stopped for a little refreshment

42:40.000 --> 42:41.968
Why the fuck are you shooting?

42:42.160 --> 42:45.403
It's just Boris. He's a fucking Chetnik

42:45.440 --> 42:48.967
He's blown the head off a taxi driver

42:49.040 --> 42:52.010
There must be some mistake.
Boris couldn't blow his nose

42:52.200 --> 42:54.646
There is no mistake. You've fucked up!

42:54.680 --> 42:57.729
Get down there and hide that car

42:57.760 --> 42:59.205
Yes, Mr Priestly

43:00.400 --> 43:01.845
Fuck

43:13.440 --> 43:14.885
Oh fuck

43:28.640 --> 43:30.085
Little prick

43:36.560 --> 43:38.961
Sirus! Stay the fuck down

43:39.240 --> 43:41.607
They're fucking shooting at us!

43:43.360 --> 43:44.441
Cover me!

43:44.800 --> 43:46.245
2 guns!

43:49.600 --> 43:50.965
Reloading!

44:05.400 --> 44:07.641
Looks like we got here just in time

44:07.680 --> 44:09.250
I've just been shot at

44:09.560 --> 44:10.482
Tony. Cover me

44:10.600 --> 44:12.045
Covering

44:13.960 --> 44:15.530
Skirmish!

44:16.080 --> 44:19.129
Popped your cherry have we, lad?

44:22.360 --> 44:23.486
Fuck!

44:31.560 --> 44:34.006
I think we got the one in the car

44:34.040 --> 44:36.407
You just shot a policeman!

44:36.440 --> 44:38.886
Those pigs were shooting at you first

44:38.920 --> 44:41.127
Are you with us or against us?

44:41.320 --> 44:43.209
You should be with us

44:43.280 --> 44:46.568
lam... you know... with... you lot

44:47.320 --> 44:49.800
That's it, just stick with us

44:49.920 --> 44:53.641
Without giving them smoke signals!
Where the fuck's Asif?

44:53.680 --> 44:55.842
I don't know. I'll call him

44:57.040 --> 44:59.088
I've left my phone in the taxi

44:59.120 --> 45:00.246
Use mine

45:00.320 --> 45:01.606
Do you know his number?

45:01.640 --> 45:04.405
Why would we need you
if we had his number?

45:04.440 --> 45:06.124
Can't you remember his number?

45:06.160 --> 45:07.969
My mind's gone a hit blank

45:08.040 --> 45:10.407
Get your phone. We'll cover you

45:10.440 --> 45:12.124
Cover me with what?

45:12.280 --> 45:15.329
This ain't an American film!
Who even says that?

45:15.360 --> 45:18.011
I don't think its current occupant...

45:18.040 --> 45:22.284
<i>...is</i> gonna put up much in
the way of objections, is he?

45:22.400 --> 45:25.768
Right. Ok. I'll... back in a minute

45:38.600 --> 45:40.045
Oh fuck

45:44.960 --> 45:48.089
Sirus, I have heard gunshots.
Who is shooting?

45:48.120 --> 45:51.169
I'm fine, mate. Tickety boo.
Never been better

45:51.200 --> 45:52.440
Who is shooting?

45:52.480 --> 45:54.130
All sorts of people!

45:54.240 --> 45:59.724
Come to the other side of the warehouse.
I will open the big doors. It's safe here

45:59.760 --> 46:01.603
Ok, I'll just wander round

46:01.640 --> 46:05.565
Let me know if I'm mincing.
I'm damn close to shitting myself

46:05.600 --> 46:13.087
I'll bring the Welsh arm of Desert Storm
with me, shall I? We can all have tea

46:15.120 --> 46:17.168
Tony. Go see if we got him

46:17.200 --> 46:20.090
Why me? Let's send Sirus.
We'll cover him

46:20.120 --> 46:22.771
Good idea. Off you go, Sirus

46:22.800 --> 46:25.007
What was wrong with the first idea?

46:25.040 --> 46:26.769
Go and have a look

46:26.840 --> 46:33.166
Sirus, man. You've done precious
little so far. Go and have a look

46:48.560 --> 46:49.925
He's moving

46:50.160 --> 46:52.367
Let's go get the fucker

46:53.280 --> 46:55.521
You are doing the manhandling

46:55.560 --> 46:58.928
I'm not really the manhandling type

47:04.320 --> 47:05.845
Move it!

47:12.480 --> 47:13.925
I'll have that

47:16.440 --> 47:18.169
Right. Get him out

47:18.240 --> 47:20.083
What? Oh fuck!

47:25.320 --> 47:26.845
Oh, fucking hell

47:39.960 --> 47:40.927
Hello

47:40.960 --> 47:42.564
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

47:43.200 --> 47:44.964
I'm here, Mr Priestly

47:45.160 --> 47:48.881
You're supposed to be by
the fucking taxi. Move it!

47:49.000 --> 47:51.002
You want me to buy you a taxi?

47:51.080 --> 47:55.802
<i>Listen you Cossack cum. Get your
van</i> full <i>of fuck-ups down here now</i>

47:55.840 --> 47:57.808
<i>Meet me by the white container</i>

47:57.840 --> 48:02.129
<i>Don't drive by the front of the
warehouse. Don't let them see you</i>

48:02.160 --> 48:04.640
Yes of course, Mr Priestly

48:08.160 --> 48:09.605
Who phoned?

48:09.880 --> 48:11.325
Cunt

48:11.880 --> 48:16.283
We go meet him by white
taxi he want me to buy

48:17.280 --> 48:20.363
He said go to front of warehouse

48:20.400 --> 48:22.243
Find a taxi for the cunt...

48:22.280 --> 48:24.009
I drive. We kill

48:26.640 --> 48:27.926
Hey!

48:28.720 --> 48:29.846
Wait for me!

48:29.880 --> 48:33.202
Boris! Oh fuck, I piss on leg.
Boris! Wait!

48:41.920 --> 48:43.126
Hello

48:43.200 --> 48:45.202
Who the fuck is that?

48:46.000 --> 48:49.686
Ah, that'll be that
lucky-to-be-alive shit Sirus

48:49.840 --> 48:50.966
Speaking

48:51.200 --> 48:52.804
Is Terence alive?

48:54.480 --> 48:55.766
Kind of

48:55.800 --> 48:58.485
That's the caring <i>&</i> sharing over

48:58.520 --> 49:02.320
Give me the money <i>&</i> gear
Huck off& we'll say no more

49:02.360 --> 49:03.805
Why are you doing this?

49:03.840 --> 49:06.764
This is not a matter
that's up for discussion

49:06.800 --> 49:10.771
Time to get past the
illusion of choice, Sirus

49:12.120 --> 49:14.202
Wanna die, pussy hole?

49:15.040 --> 49:17.884
Go home to the Valleys
and put Sirus back on

49:17.920 --> 49:20.526
Now, that thing ain't gonna happen

49:20.600 --> 49:22.204
You can'! stop me

49:22.800 --> 49:25.007
There is nothing you can do...

49:25.040 --> 49:28.044
...except look on as I take everything

49:28.080 --> 49:29.366
You and whose army?

49:29.400 --> 49:31.164
Oh, I've got an army

49:31.200 --> 49:33.168
Not the most law-abiding, mind

49:33.200 --> 49:35.806
You know, I can see you, right now

49:35.840 --> 49:38.571
Nice sheepskin collar

49:38.800 --> 49:40.882
You almost look pretty

49:41.440 --> 49:43.681
Right. We move. Now.

49:44.640 --> 49:46.005
Fuck

49:47.320 --> 49:48.685
Clear

49:48.800 --> 49:50.723
Fucking hell, man

49:59.920 --> 50:01.922
Get the big rat-ta-tat gun!

50:02.280 --> 50:03.964
We kill everybody!

50:04.640 --> 50:06.961
We kill every motherfucker!!

50:09.040 --> 50:11.486
Get all fucking bullets!!!

50:12.280 --> 50:15.124
We kill all the motherfuckers!!!

50:20.800 --> 50:22.245
Bastard!

50:22.800 --> 50:24.245
Fuck

50:24.920 --> 50:27.002
Get us in, Sirus

50:29.400 --> 50:30.606
What's that?

50:30.680 --> 50:32.125
<i>(SWAG</i>

50:32.360 --> 50:34.044
Get down!

51:04.880 --> 51:06.325
Who the fuck was that?

51:06.360 --> 51:08.567
Maybe that was the army

51:09.120 --> 51:11.521
Well, the van's kinda green!

51:11.680 --> 51:14.843
Sirus, get that tucking door open

51:15.720 --> 51:17.165
You ok?

51:17.720 --> 51:20.371
- There is more shooting!
- Where have you been?

51:20.440 --> 51:22.681
- What is he doing here?
- Not much

51:22.720 --> 51:24.609
There's a dead guy in the van

51:24.640 --> 51:26.369
I know. I saw you shoot him!

51:26.400 --> 51:28.926
One of them was dead already. Junkies

51:28.960 --> 51:30.962
We can't leave corpses lying about

51:31.000 --> 51:34.368
Bring them in.
There is an elevator to the top floor

51:34.520 --> 51:36.887
Oh brilliant! Everybody, grab a body!

51:36.960 --> 51:38.121
Shut up

51:38.160 --> 51:42.449
You take Mr Bleeding Policeman in.
Asif, give me the key

51:42.520 --> 51:49.722
Me <i>&</i> Tony will have a tidy-up down here.
Then there will be words. Now move

51:54.040 --> 51:55.963
Watch your step

52:08.320 --> 52:10.243
I'm sorry

52:12.120 --> 52:15.567
I did not mean for any of this to happen

52:15.680 --> 52:19.207
It's just all a bit out of hand, mate

52:37.160 --> 52:38.764
There

52:47.680 --> 52:52.163
- What the fuck is she doing here?
- Sirus, come!

52:58.720 --> 53:00.484
Fucking hell

53:00.880 --> 53:03.963
You can't leave those 2 outside.
Go and get them

53:04.000 --> 53:09.040
- I'm not going back out there
- Go and get them, Sirus!

53:09.840 --> 53:11.604
Pari

53:19.880 --> 53:21.962
Just what we need. More guns

53:22.000 --> 53:26.085
Best not to leave this kind
of hardware lying about

53:27.040 --> 53:29.486
I see you brought some friends

53:29.520 --> 53:31.170
Grab the messy one

53:31.360 --> 53:33.283
Ah fuck, really?

53:36.800 --> 53:39.929
I think I'm gonna be sick

53:55.760 --> 53:58.889
Where is my uncle?
What have you done with him?

53:58.920 --> 54:00.843
You fucking pig!

54:02.800 --> 54:04.723
Fucking sinner

54:15.000 --> 54:16.684
Pari

54:20.440 --> 54:22.727
What did you do to him!?

54:23.160 --> 54:24.446
Yeah

54:24.720 --> 54:27.041
He was a sinner, just like you

54:27.080 --> 54:29.003
And the Lord judged him

54:29.160 --> 54:31.640
And found him wanting

54:43.720 --> 54:47.884
Hey! Asif, what the fuck are
you doing? We need him alive

54:47.960 --> 54:49.485
He deserves death

54:49.520 --> 54:50.885
Who the fuck is she?

54:50.920 --> 54:53.446
Pari is with us.
I'm going to kill this man

54:53.640 --> 54:55.688
We need him alive Asif

54:55.720 --> 54:56.960
Do not shoot

54:57.000 --> 54:59.571
Puck's sake, put the guns down

54:59.760 --> 55:01.046
Stay back

55:01.720 --> 55:05.088
Guys, it's Pari. It's alright.
Put the guns down

55:05.400 --> 55:07.926
He killed my uncle. He deserves to die

55:08.040 --> 55:11.647
That might be true, but
would you mind killing him later?

55:11.800 --> 55:14.531
Put the fucking guns down!

55:14.880 --> 55:18.123
We're all on the same team, yeah?

55:19.160 --> 55:21.083
Listen to me, mate

55:21.440 --> 55:23.841
Asif, put the gun down

55:34.880 --> 55:36.166
Fucking hell

55:36.200 --> 55:38.123
We cool, Missy?

55:38.760 --> 55:43.561
Is anyone else coming to this party
that you neglected to tell me about?

55:43.600 --> 55:46.001
- She's fine!
- True that

55:46.080 --> 55:48.845
I presume you know how
to use that little thing?

55:48.880 --> 55:52.930
I will kill anyone who tries lo hurl
my family or lake what is ours

55:52.960 --> 55:54.450
Well, that's lovely

55:54.600 --> 56:00.448
But let me be clear; nobody is
to kill anybody just yet, ok!?

56:01.320 --> 56:03.129
Fucking hell, ok!

56:03.520 --> 56:04.567
Good

56:04.680 --> 56:07.843
Get these bumba klarts out of here

56:08.880 --> 56:10.325
Move your arse!

56:10.440 --> 56:11.646
Come on

56:11.960 --> 56:13.485
Fucking darkies!

56:19.120 --> 56:21.327
Where's the rest of it?

56:24.520 --> 56:27.524
Asif. You've got some explaining to do

56:27.560 --> 56:31.007
These fucks wouldn't
go to all this trouble...

56:31.040 --> 56:33.520
...over what you have here

56:34.400 --> 56:36.004
I don't know what you're talking...

56:36.040 --> 56:37.405
Blood klart

56:37.440 --> 56:41.206
It means there's a whole
lot more you ain't telling us

56:41.240 --> 56:42.810
He doesn't know anything

56:42.840 --> 56:43.966
I think he does

56:44.040 --> 56:47.806
Sirus, even you ain't
worth killing over 2 kilos

56:47.920 --> 56:50.002
We are prepared to be helpful

56:50.680 --> 56:51.886
Isn't that right?

56:52.000 --> 56:54.321
Tis right. We love to be useful

56:54.640 --> 56:57.325
I think it would benefit all if we stayed

56:57.400 --> 56:59.289
But we ain't going to

57:01.040 --> 57:02.565
Asif?

57:06.120 --> 57:08.964
Somehow they know
how much my uncle had

57:09.200 --> 57:10.770
How much?

57:16.000 --> 57:17.650
About 50 kilos

57:17.800 --> 57:19.404
50 kilos!?

57:21.000 --> 57:23.651
That's over a million
quids worth of gear

57:23.720 --> 57:25.085
How much do you want?

57:25.120 --> 57:26.645
We're taking all of it

57:27.040 --> 57:30.681
In return for the saving of your lives

57:32.880 --> 57:35.611
Me <i>&</i> Tony are gonna have a scout outside

57:35.640 --> 57:37.165
Sirus

57:46.240 --> 57:50.484
I think you should ask that tucker
about this so-called army

57:50.640 --> 57:53.211
Can I leave you to do that?

57:53.520 --> 57:54.965
I can ask him

57:55.000 --> 57:57.241
With extreme prejudice

57:57.280 --> 57:59.203
Don't go easy on him

57:59.560 --> 58:01.005
Ok. Alright

58:01.280 --> 58:02.281
Good

58:02.320 --> 58:05.369
Back in a shake of a lamb's tail

58:09.160 --> 58:11.049
I'm gonna call this Priestly

58:11.080 --> 58:12.491
Don't be stupid

58:12.520 --> 58:14.090
It's good to talk

58:14.120 --> 58:16.168
- Sirus
- Shhh

58:20.680 --> 58:22.603
Good evening

58:22.800 --> 58:25.770
Good evening? For who, exactly?

58:25.800 --> 58:29.885
Sirus, you little poof.
I'm looking at your niggers right now

58:29.920 --> 58:33.288
Well I'm staring at your pal,
all tied up <i>&</i> bleeding

58:33.680 --> 58:35.125
He's expendable

58:35.160 --> 58:38.323
What do you mean?
This is your friend <i>&</i> colleague

58:38.360 --> 58:40.761
He's a nonce <i>&</i> he's expendable

58:40.800 --> 58:43.849
He won't even mind; he's a Christian!

58:43.880 --> 58:48.090
So as that little threat
didn't work out, boy... my turn

58:48.240 --> 58:51.403
I have the entire police
force at my disposal

58:51.440 --> 58:54.603
I can find your Amanda
in a matter of minutes

58:54.680 --> 58:59.607
So why don't you <i>&</i> your Paki chums
just hand over his uncle's stash?

58:59.640 --> 59:01.961
Listen. We can talk this out

59:02.000 --> 59:04.480
Goodbye Sirus, you twat!

59:06.800 --> 59:08.245
Oh fuck

59:08.440 --> 59:10.442
Sirus called Priestly

59:11.160 --> 59:13.162
He's gonna get Amanda

59:13.600 --> 59:20.051
The best thing you can do for your girl
is find out what the fuck is going on

59:20.240 --> 59:21.480
Him

59:21.600 --> 59:24.126
You go and ask him

59:24.760 --> 59:26.330
Now go, Sirus

59:27.640 --> 59:29.404
Go!

59:34.040 --> 59:39.604
...mercy shall follow me all the
days of my life. My cup overflows

59:41.040 --> 59:42.963
Your only way out...

59:43.320 --> 59:45.049
<i>...is</i> to let me go

59:45.920 --> 59:53.042
Your only way out is to tell me who else
is out there and if he's got Amanda

59:53.560 --> 59:57.645
Jesus fucking Christ,
I'll fucking kill you!

59:57.760 --> 59:59.967
The Lord is my shepherd

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.004
I shall not want

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.091
Just tell me who else is
out there before I kill you!

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.929
You're not a killer

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.851
You're too much of a coward

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.721
Prick

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.287
My soul he doth restore...

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.524
...again

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.481
You're going to Hell, Sirus

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.488
You're going to Hell

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.361
Help me

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.523
Fucking help me

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.927
Which one looks the least dead?

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.883
- Him
- He's had an overdose

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.366
Good. Tie him to that chair

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.402
He ain't going nowhere

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.161
Shh, I know he's dead.
Just help him tie him up

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.691
Tony, help him

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.285
Alright, alright

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.323
Keep your hair on

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:02.768
I'm only keeping you
alive for information

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.010
Your Russian mate doesn't know anything.
He's no use to me

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.045
So in a moment, I'm gonna shoot him...

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:15.405
...unless you tell me exactly what
I want to fucking know, right now

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.809
There's nothing you can do to me

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.205
And the Lord will have mercy on his soul

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:27.125
Fine

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:31.091
Puck's sake! You couldn't help him?

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.521
I'm calming my nerves

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.687
- Is he ready?
- Yes

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.491
You just tied up a dead guy

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.803
Yeah. Distinctly lucking unhelpful

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.923
Last chance, Terence!

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.085
This is on you

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.767
- You can't scare me
- I'll kill him

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.569
You can'! scare me

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.125
Yeah?

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.368
The Lord will have mercy on his soul

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.324
Fine

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.165
Our Father who an in Heaven

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.484
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom cum...

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:22.329
Can't you shut this fucker up'?
I've had a right tit-full of his crap

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.845
He's crazy

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.566
...as we forgive those
who trespass against...

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.483
How the fuck's he gonna
tell us anything now?

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.409
He's going to write it down

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:45.121
There might be a problem.
He hasn't got any fingers

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.961
What do you mean?
He can't be a copper without fingers

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.766
What the fuck did you do that for?

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.764
I didn't know you would
shoot his tongue out!

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.964
There's no point keeping him now.
We'll finish him together

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.650
I'm not shooting anyone

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.411
You are either with us or against us

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.489
We're gonna finish this cunt now

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.601
Point your fucking gun at him

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.563
<i>(Sn me scum oi 'A</i>

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.405
One

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.451
Two

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.445
Three

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:30.646
Sirus man, sometimes you're such a twat

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.443
Right. We move

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.644
What did you find out?

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.284
Lord was his shepherd

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.446
Useless!

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.244
I want to go home

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:53.651
We have to go get this fucker.
Asif, can you use that weapon? Good

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.284
Sirus, you're the bait

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.446
What?

01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:01.088
You go out there, draw him out,
then me <i>&</i> Tony will put him down

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.610
I'm not going out there

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.086
Don't worry. I'll cover you

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.567
Right, I will give this Priestly a tinkle

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.605
Don't worry, Del.
We'll get them back for Boris

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.564
But Mr Cunt

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.803
Boris only friend

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.924
There there

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.562
Pull yourself together

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.166
Sirus

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.203
No, it's the handsome one

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.249
What do you want, nigger?

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.169
<i>That ain't playing nice</i>

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:34.450
I thought we could come to
a deal in a civilised manner

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:35.721
Go on

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.003
<i>We give you half the gear,
you let us walk away</i>

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.611
You think you're in a
position to bargain?

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:45.087
Well I've got the gear and you want it

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.284
I kill you, chocolate face motherfuck

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:51.410
I cut off your balls & make you eat them

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.528
You motherfuck!!

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:58.602
I piss on your head,
I cut off your balls, cunt...

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.211
Well

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.131
That could have gone better

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:07.607
Fuck, fucker, fuck, piss!

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.083
Oh, Mr Cunt

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.967
You wanna kill them, eh, Del?
Kill them all for Boris?

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.684
I kill them all

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.811
I guess you'll be needing these then

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.366
What?

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.449
Keys to the warehouse

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.605
- Give me
- Easy now, Del boy

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:34.123
You need to get your head straight

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.364
I think maybe I'll hang on to them

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.489
Easy now, boy

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.806
You wake up a little now, yeah?

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.411
Do a bit of that charlie of yours

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.084
Pep up a bit

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.921
Oh, Mr Cunt

01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:00.130
Before we go any further,
we have some unfinished business

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:05.530
What my man is referring to is
the whereabouts of the 50 kilos

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.040
Asif?

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:13.082
Only my uncle knew <i>&</i> now he is dead.
He never told me where it is

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.167
Bullshit

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.168
Tony, he doesn't know anything

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.680
Then why are we still fucking here!?

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.643
He doesn't know!

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:30.241
I reckon if I was Asif's uncle
I wouldn't tell him either

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.444
Let them take it

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.603
When we are all safe

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.165
Deal

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.891
We want to see it first

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.731
I will bring it. But you must wait here

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:50.970
There are things that belong to
my family. Things you cannot see

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.684
I must go alone

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.689
You've got one minute

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.210
What?

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.084
Pari?

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.164
Well now

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.607
This is nice, isn't it?

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.522
Nobody move except to...
lower your weapons

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.728
We ain't lowering shit

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.964
Tedious

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.283
So tedious

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.680
Delski here's a bit tetchy

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.291
Partly because

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:27.563
He's upset about his friend Boris

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.251
Partly because

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:30.770
He's a psycho

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:36.406
And partly because he's just shoved
half of Columbia up his nose. Point is...

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:38.522
...he could go off at any moment

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.488
If he hurts her, you will die

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:45.242
Well I wouldn't expect anything less
Asif, you little faggot

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:47.283
Want a light, Sirus?

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:51.362
No, I'm alright thanks

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.004
So polite

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.643
My little fucking sunflower you are

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.085
Watched you grow

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.527
What makes you think
I give a fuck about her?

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.728
You haven't done anything so far

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.410
So I don't think you will

01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:07.885
I kill little girl

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.685
Cut chocolate face motherfuck

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.211
Kill hatty man

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.924
Fucking brains everywhere!

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.291
Control him!

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.328
Easy now, Del. Remember

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:18.970
Funeral for Boris

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:20.884
All the angels

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.609
Angels for Boris

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.243
Kill every fucker

01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:26.442
Then little angels for my Boris

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.045
Angels

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.603
Now listen carefully

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:34.366
Me <i>&</i> Del <i>&</i> the young lady
are gonna get the gear; oh yes

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:35.890
I listened in for a bit

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.127
And you're all gonna stay here

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.524
Right here

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.285
Until we've gone

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.688
I'll drop the girl off somewhere

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.042
And I'm sure she'll give
one of you heroes a tinkle

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.764
Come on now, Del son

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.410
Nice and easy

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.245
Little angels

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.765
For Boris

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.604
Kill fuckers!

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.124
Oh and er...

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.523
If it's any consolation

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.881
I'll probably leave Del here

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.323
I think he likes you

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.965
Pari

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.967
Asif! Shut up and listen

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:34.926
Kill time, chocolate face motherfuckers!

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.050
Shit!

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.085
Sirus man

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.921
I am well impressed

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.927
Oh shit, I'm sorry mate

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.085
Pari?

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.804
He's getting away

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.249
Where are we going?

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.886
Sirus

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.767
So you're the fucking hero now, huh?

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.887
Not a step closer, Asif

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:21.564
You're not gonna wriggle out
of this one, you slippery cunt

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.205
You cannot escape

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.688
Put the gun down. I know it's empty

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.004
Come round here

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.485
Slowly

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.285
I'm disappointed in you, Asif

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.881
You're gonna bring me a car

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.644
And in exchange

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.964
I won't kill

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.843
The girl

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:53.851
Show some fucking enthusiasm
Asif, I'm being reasonable here

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:56.565
- You let her go, first
- No

01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.123
I'm enjoying her company too much

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.929
See who your friends are now, eh Sirus?

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.684
Looks like...

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:10.605
...you're gonna die after all

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.523
Pari, get out of the van

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.723
Fucking whore!

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.485
Well well

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:56.049
Never borrow a gun from Sirus

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.049
Not very frightening now, is he?

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.362
Nice work there miss

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.203
Fucking wogs

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.520
Check out the mouth on him

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.802
Alright there, Sirus?

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.364
<i>Yeah, “skew Mo, mam</i>

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.129
You done well, boyo

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:25.765
B

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.081
What shall we do with him?

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.685
Leave him be, man

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.327
He's not going anywhere

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.204
Where's the gear?

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.767
Keep an eye on him Sirus

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:49.806
No way! This is crazy, Bl

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.769
What you gonna do, Sirus?

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.723
You little prick

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:18.887
I think our friend could use
a bit of pain-relief Tony

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.883
Right you are, B

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.726
How do you think we should give it him?

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:37.924
Apply liberally to all affected areas

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.931
It has worked out nice for all of us

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.924
But all good things must come to an end

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.485
Right then

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.325
Me <i>&</i> Tony gonna clean up around here.
So don't you worry about a thing

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.690
Asif. Pleasure doing business with you

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:13.764
That should hold you till next week

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.805
Whatever you've got there,
you've earned it

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:20.400
See, you did alright Sirus

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.763
Now get back to that girl of yours

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.523
LEWIS

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.400
We should do this again

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.165
Sirus

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:50.003
- You alright to get home?
- Yeah

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.963
I am sorry for what happened today

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:55.963
Sorry about your uncle

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.125
I'll call you

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.362
<i>So I'm Sims</i>

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:49.810
<i>And We had better days</i>

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:58.801
<i>I suppose you want a moral m the story</i>

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.521
<i>We“ don't ask me</i>

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.444
Not a fucking word

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:09.960
<i>You'd think after at! that</i>

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.485
<i>I'd give it up</i>

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.802
<i>Get out of the game</i>

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.442
<i>Did I, though'?</i>

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.361
<i>Did I fuck</i>

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:34.208
<i>I have learned one thing though</i>

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:40.764
<i>There's no place quite like Hackney</i>

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.491
