00:41.000 --> 00:42.932
The world will have to
deal with us.

00:44.832 --> 00:46.449
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

00:46.716 --> 00:48.732
- Who's Cassie?
- I'm Kyle's ability.

00:49.066 --> 00:50.749
<i>You ever go visit
your cousin, Shawn?</i>

00:50.849 --> 00:53.866
<i>Maybe someone should try injecting him
with a big old dose of promicin.</i>

00:54.049 --> 00:55.199
It's all about to happen.

00:55.516 --> 00:56.582
What's going to happen?

01:00.791 --> 01:02.507
Thumb through the book,
if you'd like.

01:02.699 --> 01:05.615
A lot of it is written
in a code or something.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.257
- Maia, this is my friend, Ben.
- I've heard a lot about you.

01:08.357 --> 01:10.686
You saw me getting married
to my sister's boyfriend?

01:11.037 --> 01:12.737
These shots are free.

01:12.837 --> 01:14.378
Give them to anyone
who wants them,

01:14.478 --> 01:16.645
but be careful
to explain the risks.

01:16.745 --> 01:18.208
There are no guarantees.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.045
There never are.

01:51.051 --> 01:52.051
Is this seat taken?

01:52.917 --> 01:54.034
It is now.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.693
I'm April,
by the way.

01:59.376 --> 02:00.776
Peter. Barton.

02:01.393 --> 02:02.737
So, what's good tonight?

02:03.314 --> 02:05.281
I recommend
the lemon drop martini.

02:07.026 --> 02:09.336
Bartender,
can I get two more?

02:11.148 --> 02:12.242
Is that okay?

02:12.770 --> 02:15.403
I don't want you to think
I'm hitting on you or anything.

02:15.770 --> 02:16.986
So, what do you do, Peter?

02:17.136 --> 02:19.037
I'm V.P. of client relations
for ANEXXO.

02:19.520 --> 02:20.761
We're in the fortune 500.

02:20.861 --> 02:23.637
Energy. Communications.
Some defense work...

02:23.866 --> 02:26.637
I get it. You're one of the guys
that runs the world.

02:26.970 --> 02:29.837
Me? No, but...
I work for those guys.

02:30.486 --> 02:32.153
So, what brings you to Seattle?

02:32.487 --> 02:35.604
The company's in the midst
of a major project, and...

02:35.820 --> 02:39.020
they hit a little snag, so...
I'm here to do some triage.

02:39.170 --> 02:40.770
You're going to save the day?

02:41.186 --> 02:42.436
Hopefully.

02:46.561 --> 02:47.937
And how are you going
to do that?

02:49.145 --> 02:51.762
I'm gonna bribe someone
to look the other way.

02:54.936 --> 02:56.836
I can't believe
I just told you that.

02:57.687 --> 02:59.154
Look, do me a favor...

02:59.787 --> 03:02.729
- forget what I just said.
- It's already forgotten.

03:04.829 --> 03:06.583
So, how much money
are we talking about?

03:06.966 --> 03:09.588
$300,000. I'm picking it up
tomorrow afternoon.

03:11.560 --> 03:12.660
Oh, my God.

03:13.304 --> 03:15.579
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this stuff.

03:16.187 --> 03:18.079
Did they put something
in this drink?

03:19.145 --> 03:21.937
- Who are you anyway?
- I'm just a girl you met in a bar.

03:22.772 --> 03:24.337
Don't ask me
any more questions, okay?

03:24.824 --> 03:26.337
What room are you in, Peter?

03:26.437 --> 03:27.445
315.

03:33.736 --> 03:34.736
What I just told you,

03:35.286 --> 03:36.311
don't repeat it.

03:36.561 --> 03:38.744
It would be bad for you,
for me, for...

03:40.011 --> 03:41.144
everyone.

03:48.609 --> 03:49.625
Let me guess...

03:50.125 --> 03:51.791
- The truth hurts.
- It usually does.

03:52.625 --> 03:55.433
So what do we got?
Cheating husband? Tax fraud...

03:55.533 --> 03:58.274
Try corporate intrigue.
Try bribery.

03:58.408 --> 04:01.058
Try $300,000
arriving tomorrow.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.746
- Room 315.
- 300 grand?

04:05.179 --> 04:06.658
Baby, you're good.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.158
Wow. Okay.

04:09.425 --> 04:11.916
All right, so we'll hit him up
for 20% to keep quiet.

04:12.016 --> 04:14.970
That's... 60,000 bucks.

04:16.620 --> 04:17.620
Love me?

04:18.853 --> 04:19.869
I do.

04:20.983 --> 04:22.583
And it's not like
I can lie to you.

04:23.216 --> 04:24.387
No, you can't.

04:25.516 --> 04:26.541
No one can.

04:40.883 --> 04:42.550
Glad I remembered
this place.

04:43.266 --> 04:45.608
I had a lot of fun summers
up here when I was a kid.

04:46.491 --> 04:48.900
It's pretty much
a ghost town till june, which is...

04:50.058 --> 04:52.900
a good thing, because
the whole world's looking for you.

05:06.087 --> 05:07.554
Maybe I should just
turn myself in.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.287
Spend the rest of your life in prison?
I don't think so.

05:10.458 --> 05:13.625
It was no coincidence
I was there when that van crashed.

05:15.758 --> 05:17.591
I was sent
to help you get away.

05:18.091 --> 05:20.024
This is all happening
for a reason.

05:20.741 --> 05:21.882
And what would that be?

05:22.016 --> 05:25.020
Truthfully, I'm not sure yet.
Maybe the answers are in this book.

05:25.354 --> 05:27.723
I just hope they're not in this code,
or whatever this is.

05:27.873 --> 05:30.098
Do you believe that
Jordan Collier is a Messiah?

05:30.466 --> 05:32.153
And that promicin's
gonna save the world?

05:32.253 --> 05:33.253
Yeah, I do.

05:37.283 --> 05:39.733
Even if that's true,
what does it have to do with me?

05:40.150 --> 05:41.504
My abilities are gone.

05:41.837 --> 05:44.504
My body can't tolerate promicin.

05:46.158 --> 05:48.541
I'm the enemy. I hurt shawn.

05:49.375 --> 05:50.975
I tried to kill Jordan Collier.

05:51.075 --> 05:52.525
I did kill Jordan.

05:56.209 --> 05:57.233
Believe me.

05:57.466 --> 05:58.800
I know what it feels like...

05:58.916 --> 06:01.258
to be in prison and think
you're never getting out.

06:01.658 --> 06:04.375
To feel you've done things
that no one will ever forgive you for.

06:04.508 --> 06:06.929
But no one's so far gone
that they can't be forgiven,

06:07.046 --> 06:10.400
don't have a role to play
In this new world of Jordan Collier's.

06:11.899 --> 06:14.015
I'm meant to be
a part of that world.

06:14.433 --> 06:17.266
To help bring it about,
and so are you.

06:28.609 --> 06:30.309
Colin?

06:39.280 --> 06:41.275
You're a hard woman
to find, April.

06:41.958 --> 06:43.691
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

06:44.641 --> 06:46.758
Well, you found me, Di.

06:47.583 --> 06:49.000
Now what are you gonna do
with me?

07:51.459 --> 07:55.092
It wasn't terribly smart using
mom's maiden name on your credit card.

07:55.192 --> 07:56.834
If I'd known you were gonna come
looking for me,

07:56.934 --> 07:58.495
then I would have been
more creative.

07:58.691 --> 08:01.190
I can only imagine how pissed off
you must've been

08:01.290 --> 08:02.781
when you'd heard
I'd taken the shot.

08:02.881 --> 08:04.991
I wasn't terribly happy about it,
you're right.

08:05.141 --> 08:07.524
But you are my sister,
and I was very worried about you.

08:07.658 --> 08:10.624
Besides, I knew you never would have
taken the shot...

08:11.607 --> 08:14.608
if it hadn't been for what happened
between Ben and me.

08:14.758 --> 08:17.091
Feeling a little guilty, are we?

08:17.708 --> 08:18.891
Well, don't.

08:19.141 --> 08:21.083
You and Ben
may be why I did it...

08:21.541 --> 08:23.766
But taking the shot
was the right thing for me to do.

08:24.149 --> 08:26.520
I've got money, clothes,

08:26.703 --> 08:28.587
a great guy, Colin,
who loves me,

08:29.020 --> 08:30.520
and a pretty great ability.

08:32.386 --> 08:35.072
How many times a week
are you and Ben having sex?

08:36.272 --> 08:37.464
Three.

08:38.308 --> 08:39.308
Wait, that's not...

08:40.198 --> 08:42.591
- That is none of your business.
- I know.

08:43.124 --> 08:44.474
And you told me anyway.

08:44.791 --> 08:45.891
That's my ability.

08:46.024 --> 08:48.191
I ask a question,
you tell the truth...

08:48.491 --> 08:49.499
every time.

08:49.599 --> 08:52.644
That's a pretty interesting ability.
It doesn't work on you, does it?

08:52.908 --> 08:54.291
You mean make me
tell the truth?

08:55.182 --> 08:56.432
Thankfully, no.

08:59.299 --> 09:00.933
What am I gonna do
with you, April?

09:01.066 --> 09:02.395
What am I gonna do
with you?

09:04.095 --> 09:05.845
Go back to Spain, Di.

09:06.241 --> 09:08.191
Any guilt you feel
about you and Ben...

09:08.774 --> 09:10.324
Consider yourself
absolved.

09:10.624 --> 09:12.074
Enjoy your life...

09:12.740 --> 09:14.574
and let me enjoy mine.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.582
That's wonderful, dad.

09:19.682 --> 09:22.632
I'm so glad you're walking better.
I can't wait to see it.

09:23.691 --> 09:25.008
I have to go.

09:25.541 --> 09:27.008
I love you, too.

09:28.549 --> 09:30.483
Garrity said
you wanted to see me.

09:35.224 --> 09:38.441
Have you seen the doctor's final report
on your nephew's recovery?

09:38.632 --> 09:39.649
Yes, I have.

09:39.825 --> 09:41.225
Well, now so has D.C.

09:41.858 --> 09:44.825
Those high levels of promicin
that were found in his system...

09:44.941 --> 09:46.858
People are wondering
where they came from.

09:47.875 --> 09:49.458
Yeah. Beats me.

09:50.275 --> 09:51.891
Come on, Tom.

09:52.625 --> 09:53.966
Someone
walked into the hospital

09:54.066 --> 09:56.500
and gave your nephew
a massive dose of promicin.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.579
Your sister and your son
were the only ones with him at the time.

09:59.679 --> 10:02.285
Now I'm willing to dismiss Susan
as a suspect,

10:03.200 --> 10:05.333
but I think you need
to have a talk with Kyle.

10:07.750 --> 10:09.637
Excuse me?
Mr. Farrell.

10:09.821 --> 10:11.491
Senator Lenhoff's
here to see you.

10:12.491 --> 10:14.024
Senator Lenhoff?
Are you sure?

10:14.124 --> 10:17.433
She's sure. I'm sure. And I can see
you're beginning to believe it yourself.

10:17.591 --> 10:18.908
Roland Lenhoff.

10:19.091 --> 10:20.708
The devil made flesh.

10:20.849 --> 10:21.866
We need to talk.

10:22.371 --> 10:23.387
In private.

10:27.566 --> 10:29.324
Senator, if you're here
to try to force me

10:29.424 --> 10:31.720
- to shut down the center again...
- Relax, Farrell.

10:32.054 --> 10:33.858
I don't want
to shut this place, hell!

10:34.208 --> 10:36.233
I want you to heal
as many people as possible,

10:36.333 --> 10:38.278
which is surprising, I know.
After all...

10:38.378 --> 10:39.753
I'm the guy that passed the bill

10:39.853 --> 10:43.334
forcing all you 4400s
to register your abilities.

10:43.558 --> 10:44.899
And you were
just warming up.

10:44.999 --> 10:46.808
I seem to remember one speech
where you said

10:46.908 --> 10:49.649
that if it were up to you,
we'd all be living behind barbed wire.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.971
I knew you were
going to bring that up.

10:52.921 --> 10:54.054
Have a seat.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.156
Come on, sit down.

11:00.256 --> 11:01.373
I'll admit...

11:01.656 --> 11:04.207
I have been waging
a kind of war against you.

11:04.507 --> 11:06.423
Trouble is,
I just chaired a committee,

11:06.523 --> 11:09.274
which is about to issue
a 1600-page report,

11:09.441 --> 11:11.290
which states,
in no uncertain terms,

11:11.390 --> 11:13.632
that I'm losing that war
and you are winning it.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.237
Promicin
isn't going away.

11:15.510 --> 11:17.491
Jordan Collier
made damn sure of that.

11:17.608 --> 11:19.341
If you're here
to sign terms of surrender,

11:19.441 --> 11:22.307
- I could have some drawn up.
- Who's talking about surrender?

11:22.924 --> 11:24.341
I fought in 'nam.

11:25.391 --> 11:27.058
I have the medals to prove it.

11:27.258 --> 11:28.424
And last year,

11:29.074 --> 11:32.244
I took my wife
on vacation to Saigon.

11:33.161 --> 11:36.058
I figure if I can make my peace
with Charlie,

11:36.416 --> 11:38.109
I can make my peace with you.

11:42.116 --> 11:43.924
They're holding
a special election

11:44.024 --> 11:46.850
to fill a vacant seat
on the Seattle city council.

11:47.683 --> 11:48.950
I want you to run for it.

11:50.933 --> 11:52.016
City council?

11:52.983 --> 11:55.058
Senator, I'm not a politician.

11:55.353 --> 11:56.470
The hell you're not.

11:56.941 --> 11:59.641
You stepped into the spotlight
when you reopened this center.

11:59.958 --> 12:01.808
I want you to leverage
some of the good work

12:01.908 --> 12:04.141
that you've been doing here
into something more.

12:06.279 --> 12:07.801
You're the alternative we need

12:07.901 --> 12:10.729
to Collier and his
promicin-pushing radicals.

12:11.058 --> 12:14.208
You can walk the middle path
that will unite both 4400s

12:14.325 --> 12:15.741
and non-4400s.

12:17.191 --> 12:19.958
And this middle path?
You're planning on walking it with me?

12:20.108 --> 12:21.575
Right down the center.

12:23.275 --> 12:25.833
Probably lose any chance
of re-election.

12:26.565 --> 12:29.561
My anti-4400 colleagues
will see to that.

12:30.294 --> 12:32.028
But it's what
the country needs.

12:32.861 --> 12:34.261
What the world needs.

12:36.236 --> 12:37.869
So, what do you say,
Farrell?

12:38.836 --> 12:40.769
You ready
to dance with the devil?

12:45.001 --> 12:46.650
You should've seen
that hotel suite.

12:46.750 --> 12:49.550
It must run
at $600 or $700 a night.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.550
The dress, the shoes.

12:51.767 --> 12:54.158
Moving around from city to city.
This ability of hers,

12:54.258 --> 12:57.450
however she's using it,
she's going to get herself into trouble.

12:58.300 --> 12:59.850
What are you
smiling about?

13:00.767 --> 13:02.833
Diana, come on,
April's alive.

13:03.503 --> 13:06.091
The shot didn't kill her.
She's not even living on the street.

13:06.191 --> 13:08.920
She's even involved with a guy.
This is... a win.

13:09.183 --> 13:10.750
It just doesn't
feel like a win.

13:11.183 --> 13:12.242
She's going to screw up.

13:12.342 --> 13:14.446
NTAC are going to get a hold of her,
and then what?

13:14.967 --> 13:16.650
Listen to me.
Come here for a second.

13:18.650 --> 13:21.300
You traveled 6,000 miles
to find your sister, right?

13:22.050 --> 13:24.083
You offered her help.
She refused.

13:24.744 --> 13:25.777
It's over.

13:26.550 --> 13:28.283
And now we can move back
to Spain.

13:30.101 --> 13:31.150
I guess we can.

13:32.450 --> 13:35.050
- You guess?
- No, I mean... we will.

13:35.617 --> 13:37.117
It will take a little time.

13:37.308 --> 13:38.474
I mean, the whole work thing.

13:38.574 --> 13:40.301
Come on, Diana,
it's not that complicated.

13:40.418 --> 13:42.917
All you got to do is go in there,
turn in your gun and badge,

13:43.017 --> 13:44.434
and we're on a plane
by tomorrow.

13:45.633 --> 13:47.250
I can't just do that.

13:47.383 --> 13:49.217
Not to Tom, to Meghan.

13:50.150 --> 13:52.867
You just give me a week or so
and then we're out of here.

13:55.401 --> 13:58.351
- We'll tell Maia tonight?
- Yeah. As soon as we get home.

14:07.325 --> 14:10.042
You're sure you don't want me
to go with you to pick up the money?

14:10.142 --> 14:11.896
Nah, you'd just freak
the guy out.

14:13.529 --> 14:16.646
Barton knows you put some kind
of whammy on him, right?

14:20.408 --> 14:22.550
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

14:23.583 --> 14:24.967
Still thinking
about your sister?

14:25.067 --> 14:28.008
I just can't believe she came
all that way to look for me.

14:28.675 --> 14:30.075
I didn't think she cared enough.

14:30.241 --> 14:32.012
April, she's a judgmental bitch,

14:32.728 --> 14:34.062
and I say good riddance.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.491
Besides, you don't need her anymore.
You got me.

14:40.875 --> 14:43.242
So what do you say we meet in the bar
a little after 7:00,

14:43.342 --> 14:45.450
- for a celebratory cocktail?
- Okay.

14:46.550 --> 14:48.217
Where are we off to next?

14:48.383 --> 14:50.650
I figured we'd go crash
with my brother in south beach.

14:50.767 --> 14:52.350
He just moved there
from Phoenix.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.500
Jeff says there's
money to be made in Miami.

14:55.850 --> 14:59.092
People there are holding onto
all kinds of dirty little secrets.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.301
Dirty little secrets.

15:13.401 --> 15:14.742
Got a minute, buddy?

15:14.983 --> 15:16.650
Not really.
I'm meeting some friends.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.158
It's about Shawn.

15:19.975 --> 15:21.225
What about him?

15:25.996 --> 15:28.679
The way he woke up from his coma
with all that promicin in him.

15:29.781 --> 15:32.431
People are starting to wonder
if you had something to do with it.

15:32.547 --> 15:34.414
By people, do you mean NTAC?

15:35.033 --> 15:36.850
What exactly
are you accusing me of, dad?

15:36.950 --> 15:39.250
I'm not accusing you of anything.
I'm asking you.

15:40.150 --> 15:41.175
The day at the hospital,

15:41.275 --> 15:43.521
did you give your cousin
a shot of promicin?

15:44.267 --> 15:45.283
No, I didn't.

15:45.991 --> 15:47.456
Kyle, listen to me.

15:47.556 --> 15:49.456
- If you're involved in something.
- In what ?

15:49.556 --> 15:51.812
I don't know. Last few nights,
you haven't come home...

15:51.912 --> 15:54.392
- Dad, I'm 23 years old.
- I know that.

15:56.602 --> 15:58.302
Kyle, if you're holding
anything back,

15:58.535 --> 15:59.552
Please...

16:01.118 --> 16:02.118
tell me now.

16:05.985 --> 16:07.384
I got nothing to say.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.633
Except I'm glad
Shawn's up and about.

16:09.733 --> 16:12.383
For all I know, whatever isabelle
zapped him with, it wore off.

16:12.899 --> 16:13.899
Or not.

16:15.666 --> 16:17.716
I guess we'll never know
the truth, will we?

16:18.700 --> 16:20.417
We all got to get used to that.

16:21.233 --> 16:22.450
Can I go now?

17:19.401 --> 17:21.568
<i>This is Colin.
Leave a message.</i>

17:26.701 --> 17:27.705
Colin?

17:29.750 --> 17:30.756
Babe?

17:40.932 --> 17:42.665
It's colin!
He's been shot!

17:46.557 --> 17:48.350
There was so much blood.

17:49.007 --> 17:50.974
Maia, will you go to bed now,
please, sweetie?

17:51.074 --> 17:53.081
Help me, Di.
Please, help me.

17:55.125 --> 17:58.275
April, did you honestly believe
that this guy, Barton,

17:58.375 --> 18:01.292
was just gonna hand
you over $60,000?

18:01.392 --> 18:04.499
Seemed like such an easy mark
and it's always worked before.

18:04.991 --> 18:07.541
So that's how you've
been using your ability?

18:08.083 --> 18:09.750
- To blackmail people.
- Oh, God.

18:10.233 --> 18:12.317
Don't start lecturing me
on right and wrong.

18:12.450 --> 18:14.866
- No, it's a little late for that.
- Yeah. It is.

18:14.966 --> 18:17.383
- So save your breath.
- All right, ladies, just calm down.

18:17.483 --> 18:18.683
Let's just stay calm, okay?

18:18.967 --> 18:20.850
Focus on what's
important right now.

18:26.299 --> 18:27.316
Barton?

18:28.083 --> 18:30.016
He did it, right?
He killed colin?

18:31.583 --> 18:33.933
Well, I would say
he's our number one suspect.

18:34.466 --> 18:38.175
But this $300,000
that ANEXXO's paying out

18:38.275 --> 18:39.412
in bribe money...

18:39.950 --> 18:42.550
Barton didn't happen to mention
where it was going?

18:42.650 --> 18:43.801
Does it matter?

18:45.742 --> 18:49.059
Colin, the way he looked
lying there on the floor...

18:53.401 --> 18:54.725
The hotel suite.

18:55.383 --> 18:57.050
It was in Colin's name, right?

18:57.517 --> 18:58.550
Yeah.

18:59.166 --> 19:00.950
Or one of his names.
He used a couple.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.525
And when they find the body,
there's nothing there

19:04.625 --> 19:06.567
to connect you to it,
is there?

19:06.950 --> 19:08.092
I don't think so.

19:10.875 --> 19:12.479
Ben, will you stay here?

19:12.579 --> 19:14.697
I'm gonna drive April
to a motel,

19:14.797 --> 19:17.750
or somewhere away from here
and away from Maia.

19:17.850 --> 19:20.483
I'm sorry, you'll have to stay there
until we figure this out.

19:25.911 --> 19:27.061
Are you going to turn me in?

19:29.328 --> 19:31.628
We just have to make this up
as we go along.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.208
So I can count on you, right?

19:38.358 --> 19:41.175
If my dad asks you,
and he probably will...

19:41.287 --> 19:44.054
I'm not going to tell your dad
that you gave me a promicin shot.

19:44.620 --> 19:47.370
It's hard, you know?
I mean, I love the guy so much,

19:48.395 --> 19:49.778
but the things I'm doing,

19:50.662 --> 19:52.873
- he just wouldn't understand.
- I get it, Kyle.

19:53.006 --> 19:54.106
I really do.

19:55.083 --> 19:56.583
It's just I've got...

19:56.883 --> 19:59.400
all of this other stuff
I'm dealing with.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.792
If you mean Isabelle Tyler,
don't think you have to worry about her.

20:03.892 --> 20:06.733
- She's probably long gone from Seattle.
- That's good to know.

20:07.350 --> 20:09.515
I'll fire the extra security
I had on.

20:09.932 --> 20:11.750
Anyway, I wasn't
talking about her.

20:11.932 --> 20:13.250
This is going
to sound weird.

20:13.350 --> 20:14.767
Roland Lenhoff...

20:14.933 --> 20:16.967
wants me to run for a seat
on the city council.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.525
The guy behind
the Dinstman-Lenhoff bill?

20:19.658 --> 20:22.950
He sees it as a "If you can't beat 'em,
work with 'em" kind of thing.

20:23.283 --> 20:25.283
And he knows he can't beat us.

20:25.883 --> 20:27.217
That's great, Shawn.

20:27.367 --> 20:29.300
- You said yes, right?
- I'm thinking about it.

20:29.450 --> 20:31.117
You have to do this.

20:31.283 --> 20:34.242
You get elected,
that puts a 4400 into the mainstream.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.808
They'll have to start
taking us seriously.

20:35.908 --> 20:38.385
Who knows? You could become mayor,
maybe even governor.

20:39.096 --> 20:40.200
Just one step at a time.

20:40.300 --> 20:42.550
I don't even know if I can get
elected to city council.

20:42.650 --> 20:44.342
You heal people with your hands.

20:44.442 --> 20:46.208
Show me an opponent
who can beat that.

20:48.175 --> 20:50.317
- Do you wanna be my campaign manager?
- No.

20:51.233 --> 20:52.483
But you got my vote.

20:52.650 --> 20:53.750
That's one.

20:57.455 --> 20:58.539
Not a problem.

20:58.705 --> 21:00.389
I'll have the test results
back tomorrow.

21:00.722 --> 21:02.953
- What name do I log the samples under?
- No name.

21:04.803 --> 21:07.102
- What if they're promicin positive?
- No name, Marco.

21:07.676 --> 21:09.842
I want any paperwork
handed to me and me alone.

21:09.942 --> 21:10.971
Are we clear?

21:12.704 --> 21:14.517
Actually, Tom,
I still have some questions.

21:14.617 --> 21:16.017
Do me this favor, please.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.133
But I won't ask them.

21:19.517 --> 21:20.750
Thank you.

21:21.217 --> 21:23.883
Hey, Marco.
They told me you were down here, Tom.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.575
- Have you got a minute?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

21:29.133 --> 21:31.628
I know my sister's made
a lot of bad choices in her life,

21:31.728 --> 21:34.259
but I also know that April
would never have taken that shot

21:34.359 --> 21:35.451
if it weren't for me.

21:35.556 --> 21:37.882
I understand you want
to protect your sister, Diana,

21:37.982 --> 21:39.991
but if she knows
the identity of a murderer...

21:40.091 --> 21:42.826
I can't be responsible
for sending April to prison, Tom.

21:42.942 --> 21:43.978
She's promicin positive.

21:44.109 --> 21:45.927
It's a life sentence.
You know the deal.

21:47.062 --> 21:48.455
Besides, I mean,
there's a chance

21:48.555 --> 21:50.975
that the police could get
to Barton on their own.

21:54.962 --> 21:56.272
But what if they don't?

21:56.755 --> 21:57.915
What then?

21:59.710 --> 22:02.208
Then I'll tell the authorities
everything I know.

22:03.213 --> 22:06.274
After I've bought April
a one-way ticket to Marrakech.

22:17.553 --> 22:18.821
April Skouris, right?

22:19.561 --> 22:21.552
I'm a friend of Colin's brother, Jeff.

22:21.861 --> 22:23.402
- Jeff?
- No, I'm Larry,

22:23.502 --> 22:25.663
but Jeff heard what happened
and he...

22:25.857 --> 22:27.597
He sent me here
to get you outta Seattle.

22:27.697 --> 22:29.896
Really? Well, where
are we going to go?

22:30.156 --> 22:31.953
My car's right out back.
We're gonna go to Phoenix.

22:32.057 --> 22:34.385
- What about my clothes?
- You can get some new ones, ok?

22:34.498 --> 22:36.298
If we hurry,
we can catch the next flight.

22:36.495 --> 22:37.753
Wait, Phoenix?

22:38.208 --> 22:39.409
Jeff moved to Florida.

22:39.509 --> 22:41.694
- It really doesn't matter.
- Oh, my god, help!

22:41.835 --> 22:43.553
He's trying to kill me!

22:44.600 --> 22:46.628
Help! Help!

22:50.669 --> 22:52.369
Di, I really need to know
what's going on

22:52.476 --> 22:53.912
because none of this
makes any sense.

22:54.015 --> 22:55.607
Why kill Colin?
Why come after me?

22:55.707 --> 22:57.471
We never got our hands
on any of that money.

22:57.571 --> 22:59.762
Well, that bribe money
that ANEXXO is paying out,

22:59.862 --> 23:01.823
they clearly don't want anyone
knowing about it.

23:01.923 --> 23:04.437
I guess it's time we have a talk
with this Peter Barton guy.

23:08.552 --> 23:09.735
I'm coming with you.

23:11.073 --> 23:12.285
You want the truth?

23:12.689 --> 23:13.883
I can get it for you.

23:14.658 --> 23:15.932
You sure about that?
I mean...

23:16.043 --> 23:17.668
People beat lie detectors
all the time.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.911
Tom, do you like my sister?

23:20.999 --> 23:23.660
Diana? Yeah, sure.
She's my partner, my friend.

23:24.045 --> 23:25.905
Ever had a sexual fantasy about her?

23:27.504 --> 23:29.039
Once or twice.
We were working late.

23:29.139 --> 23:31.995
Diana mentioned we were the only
two people working in the building...

23:40.951 --> 23:42.022
You can come.

23:51.904 --> 23:53.492
Peter Barton,
I'm agent Baldwin.

23:53.592 --> 23:55.368
This is agent Skouris.
We're with NTAC.

23:56.609 --> 23:57.869
Oh, God, not her.

23:57.969 --> 23:59.567
You murdered Colin, didn't you?

23:59.868 --> 24:01.644
Murdered? No.

24:01.916 --> 24:04.273
I wasn't even in the room
when your boyfriend showed up.

24:05.559 --> 24:06.686
The money.

24:07.008 --> 24:08.455
It wasn't me
you were trying to blackmail.

24:08.555 --> 24:10.341
It was the corporation.
I had to warn them.

24:10.793 --> 24:12.728
The bribe money.
Who'd you pass it off to?

24:13.009 --> 24:14.549
I tell you that, I lose my job.

24:14.812 --> 24:16.305
What was his name, Peter?

24:17.572 --> 24:19.323
Alex Lupone.
He's the director of advanced

24:19.423 --> 24:21.211
combat systems for the pentagon.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.731
Ask him why ANEXXO
was paying Lupone.

24:27.224 --> 24:28.830
Don't. Just...

24:30.121 --> 24:31.135
Don't.

24:33.614 --> 24:35.118
ANEXXO won a contract
to develop

24:35.218 --> 24:37.868
a new interceptor ballistic
body armor for the military.

24:38.486 --> 24:39.971
It was supposed to be impenetrable.

24:40.071 --> 24:42.008
So this body armor,
it was defective?

24:42.374 --> 24:44.722
There were some design flaws
which left parts of the side

24:45.052 --> 24:46.553
and shoulders unprotected.

24:47.313 --> 24:49.877
I was supposed to pay off Lupone
to look the other way.

24:51.222 --> 24:52.574
You interfered,

24:52.847 --> 24:54.384
and it was taken
out of my hands.

24:54.484 --> 24:56.462
Who did you tell
about Colin and April?

25:01.151 --> 25:03.442
Donald Mitchell. He sits
on our board of directors.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.128
He called me personally
to handle the payoff.

25:06.466 --> 25:08.616
Flew me out here
on ANEXXO's dime.

25:08.919 --> 25:10.412
Where can we find Mitchell?

25:10.808 --> 25:12.705
He's staying at
the Dorchester hotel.

25:14.938 --> 25:16.919
I didn't know anyone
was gonna die.

25:18.272 --> 25:19.654
<i>I don't like
standing up here</i>

25:19.754 --> 25:21.500
<i>and calling Roland Lenhoff
a liar,</i>

25:22.151 --> 25:25.099
<i>but the truth is,
he's been one for 40 years.</i>

25:25.533 --> 25:26.984
<i>He did not single-handedly</i>

25:27.084 --> 25:29.086
<i>hold off a platoon
of viet cong troops</i>

25:29.440 --> 25:31.219
<i>while his men
lay wounded around him.</i>

25:31.319 --> 25:33.541
<i>I know that for a fact
because I was one of those men.</i>

25:33.653 --> 25:35.133
Turn that damned thing off.

25:35.297 --> 25:37.618
<i>...performed
by staff sergeant Stephen...</i>

25:38.989 --> 25:40.230
Guess some of my colleagues

25:40.330 --> 25:41.900
heard that you and I
were meeting.

25:42.002 --> 25:43.534
Didn't waste any time
letting me know

25:43.634 --> 25:45.279
they weren't
real happy about it.

25:45.448 --> 25:46.509
Senator,

25:47.175 --> 25:48.340
I have to ask,

25:48.715 --> 25:50.045
did you falsify your war record?

25:50.145 --> 25:51.367
No, I did not.

25:51.668 --> 25:53.639
That fellow who gave
that little speech...

25:53.837 --> 25:55.470
I saved his life that day.

25:57.745 --> 26:00.769
They must've paid him a lot of money
to get him to lie like that.

26:03.323 --> 26:05.174
Well, I guess
if what he says isn't true,

26:05.274 --> 26:06.536
then it doesn't really matter.

26:06.636 --> 26:08.896
Doesn't have to be true.
It's on the television.

26:10.403 --> 26:11.788
I can tough this out.

26:12.230 --> 26:13.610
The question is, can you?

26:15.161 --> 26:17.738
'Cause they're gonna be giving you
the same kind of treatment.

26:18.043 --> 26:19.339
If not worse.

26:21.334 --> 26:22.997
People have been
telling lies about me

26:23.097 --> 26:25.447
ever since we came back
in that ball of light, so...

26:26.769 --> 26:28.600
Does that mean
you'll run for city council?

26:28.732 --> 26:30.591
It means I'm gonna run
and I'm gonna win.

26:32.170 --> 26:33.494
That's what I wanted to hear.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.775
I knew I picked myself
the right man.

26:36.557 --> 26:37.825
So what happens now?

26:38.197 --> 26:39.433
The first thing
you got to do

26:39.533 --> 26:41.095
is let people know
where you stand.

26:41.195 --> 26:43.835
That means telling the world
you're against Jordan Collier

26:43.944 --> 26:45.813
and everything
that he's been doing.

26:46.665 --> 26:47.999
You want to win this election?

26:48.102 --> 26:50.055
Then Jordan Collier is the enemy.

26:51.700 --> 26:52.949
Your enemy.

27:00.915 --> 27:02.484
- Hey, Kyle.
- Hey.

27:04.484 --> 27:05.658
How's it coming?

27:05.887 --> 27:08.570
I'm trying to decipher
these coded pages,

27:08.670 --> 27:10.451
but I'm not a cryptographer.

27:14.454 --> 27:15.571
Can I have a look?

27:23.042 --> 27:24.293
I may have lost my abilities,

27:24.393 --> 27:27.634
but I did read
the encyclopedia from A to Z.

27:27.895 --> 27:29.351
And you remember all of it?

27:30.440 --> 27:31.681
Yeah, pretty much.

27:33.447 --> 27:34.752
How are you with puzzles?

27:35.597 --> 27:37.155
Well, I guess we'll see.

27:37.865 --> 27:40.193
But you did say you brought me
here for a reason, right?

27:40.991 --> 27:42.362
That I'm part of all this.

27:44.483 --> 27:46.258
So maybe this is my chance
to prove it.

27:51.282 --> 27:53.300
I don't care
what Peter Barton claims.

27:53.608 --> 27:55.623
ANEXXO doesn't bribe
government officials.

27:55.723 --> 27:57.506
That's not the way
we conduct business.

27:57.606 --> 27:59.735
Mr. Mitchell,
did you authorize the payment

27:59.835 --> 28:01.945
of $300,000 to Alex Lupone?

28:02.060 --> 28:03.158
I did not.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.484
We never paid
Alex Lupone a penny.

28:06.825 --> 28:08.891
Now, if you'll excuse me,

28:09.216 --> 28:11.161
I have an $80 kobe beef filet

28:11.261 --> 28:12.522
growing cold on the plate.

28:12.754 --> 28:15.261
- Then what was the money for?
- It was a down payment.

28:17.962 --> 28:19.681
A down payment for what?

28:20.056 --> 28:21.502
To have Alex Lupone murdered.

28:23.865 --> 28:25.029
I didn't mean that.

28:25.754 --> 28:27.341
I don't know why
I'd say such a thing.

28:27.444 --> 28:28.871
Why have Lupone killed?

28:31.578 --> 28:33.108
I'm not answering
any more questions.

28:33.226 --> 28:36.005
Was it because you were selling
the military defective body armor?

28:37.881 --> 28:40.933
Lupone would have exposed us.
we had no choice.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.264
- I'm calling my lawyer.
- No.

28:48.364 --> 28:50.230
Not till you cancel
the hit on Lupone.

28:52.820 --> 28:54.426
I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:54.764 --> 28:56.150
How do we reach Lupone?

28:56.250 --> 28:58.356
- What is his phone number?
- There isn't one.

28:59.397 --> 29:01.547
He's on vacation
in the Brazilian jungle.

29:02.834 --> 29:04.824
The men we hired
are already down there.

29:06.824 --> 29:08.467
I have no way
of contacting them.

29:11.470 --> 29:12.894
Is this really necessary?

29:12.994 --> 29:14.362
Absolutely, it is.

29:17.421 --> 29:18.698
So what do we do now?

29:19.280 --> 29:21.680
Well, we'll get in touch
with the Brazilian authorities

29:21.780 --> 29:24.210
and hope that they get in touch
with Lupone first.

29:24.310 --> 29:25.388
But in the meantime,

29:25.488 --> 29:26.940
I'm going to need you
to come into NTAC

29:27.040 --> 29:28.338
and make sure that Mitchell

29:28.599 --> 29:30.402
repeats his confession
for the record.

29:30.751 --> 29:31.784
I can't do that.

29:31.887 --> 29:33.825
I walk into NTAC,
I don't come out.

29:33.925 --> 29:35.914
No, I'll speak to Meghan.
We'll explain the circumstances.

29:36.014 --> 29:37.919
What if that doesn't work?
Can't take that chance.

29:38.019 --> 29:39.791
April, without some coaxing
from your ability,

29:39.891 --> 29:42.378
Mitchell is going to deny
everything he just told us.

29:42.478 --> 29:45.371
He's going to get away with murder.
He's gonna get away with Colin's murder.

29:45.471 --> 29:47.528
- Do you want that?
- Look, I can't do that.

29:47.745 --> 29:49.660
- I'm sorry.
- April, you've been running away

29:49.760 --> 29:51.142
your entire life.

29:51.283 --> 29:54.489
From your family, from school,
from responsibility.

29:54.663 --> 29:57.247
And I don't know, maybe I'm...
Maybe I'm to blame for that.

29:57.347 --> 30:00.013
Maybe I pushed you away.
Maybe I wasn't there for you.

30:00.113 --> 30:01.659
I don't know.
But this time...

30:02.649 --> 30:04.818
This time, you can't run away.

30:07.715 --> 30:08.795
Watch me.

30:15.654 --> 30:18.330
<i>All right. Time to get
to the tough questions.</i>

30:18.824 --> 30:22.383
Do you think the average citizen
is ready to vote for a 4400?

30:23.092 --> 30:24.365
Well, I'm hoping so,

30:24.465 --> 30:28.189
being there's a lot more non-4400s
out there than people with abilities.

30:28.411 --> 30:30.946
But more people
are taking the shot all the time.

30:31.932 --> 30:33.238
How do you feel about that?

30:33.596 --> 30:35.553
Do you agree with
Jordan Collier's decision

30:35.653 --> 30:38.298
to hand out promicin
to anybody who wants it?

30:41.803 --> 30:43.164
No. I don't.

30:44.833 --> 30:46.411
Half of those people
are going to die.

30:46.542 --> 30:47.791
Thousands already have.

30:48.346 --> 30:51.078
Are you calling Jordan Collier
a mass murderer?

30:51.585 --> 30:53.454
I think that Jordan...

30:54.411 --> 30:57.847
should've waited until the odds
of survival were better than 50/50.

30:58.101 --> 31:00.298
A lot better than 50/50.

31:00.555 --> 31:01.824
If he wanted to change the world,

31:01.924 --> 31:03.569
there are safer ways
of doing so.

31:04.452 --> 31:05.907
Like running for city council?

31:06.429 --> 31:08.082
Well, that's a start anyway.

31:13.742 --> 31:15.029
<i>April, it's me.</i>

31:16.022 --> 31:17.714
- Go away.
- <i>Not until we've talked.</i>

31:17.814 --> 31:18.999
<i>Now just let me in.</i>

31:20.352 --> 31:21.526
<i>Come on, open up.</i>

31:36.675 --> 31:38.149
So where do you go now?

31:39.181 --> 31:40.965
I really hadn't thought
that far ahead.

31:41.698 --> 31:42.984
I never do, do I?

31:43.153 --> 31:44.561
Maybe this time you should.

31:47.523 --> 31:49.016
You want to hear
something funny?

31:50.030 --> 31:51.946
I thought when
I got this ability,

31:52.669 --> 31:54.040
it would change my life.

31:55.561 --> 31:56.622
And it did.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.444
Changed my circumstances anyway.

31:59.544 --> 32:00.852
I got better clothes.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.284
I eat in better restaurants.

32:03.481 --> 32:06.356
Fly first-class
for the first time in my life.

32:08.904 --> 32:10.369
But it didn't change me.

32:13.608 --> 32:15.420
No ability is going to do that.

32:16.772 --> 32:18.171
You have to change yourself.

32:19.067 --> 32:20.128
And you can.

32:21.001 --> 32:22.090
How?

32:23.142 --> 32:24.560
By marching into NTAC?

32:25.632 --> 32:26.825
That would be brave.

32:27.341 --> 32:29.059
Except I'm not brave, am I?

32:30.986 --> 32:33.531
Another one of my many faults.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.143
It's not too late.

32:44.039 --> 32:46.546
You can still be the person
that you want to be.

32:47.860 --> 32:49.043
Look, I...

32:49.353 --> 32:51.898
I can't say that I approve
of what you've been up to.

32:53.670 --> 32:56.506
But you did say that
you loved this guy, Colin.

32:58.318 --> 32:59.454
And if you did,

33:00.899 --> 33:02.037
if that's true,

33:04.551 --> 33:06.532
then you have to
speak up for him.

33:08.538 --> 33:10.125
And only you can do that.

33:13.379 --> 33:16.251
The man is guilty of multiple felonies
and he's threatening to sue us?

33:16.355 --> 33:19.350
Mitchell's claiming harassment,
intimidation, oh, and false arrest.

33:19.496 --> 33:22.263
And ANEXXO's lawyers have the muscle
to make a case like this stick.

33:22.408 --> 33:23.436
Come on, Meghan.

33:23.588 --> 33:25.456
He's responsible for
one murder we know of,

33:25.556 --> 33:26.900
he plotted two others,

33:27.022 --> 33:29.080
and his corporation is trying
to defraud the U.S. government,

33:29.197 --> 33:30.699
and we're just
gonna let him walk?

33:31.099 --> 33:33.467
You tell me this guy deserves to be
locked up and I'll believe you,

33:33.567 --> 33:34.958
but I need more than your word.

33:35.424 --> 33:37.640
I need that woman, the one
that got his initial confession.

33:38.598 --> 33:40.706
Look, I know
she's promicin positive,

33:40.818 --> 33:42.344
but you need to convince
her to come forward.

33:42.452 --> 33:43.595
I don't think that's gonna happen.

33:43.695 --> 33:46.332
Then there's no way we're going
to get an indictment against Mitchell.

33:46.432 --> 33:47.567
Not without proof.

33:47.667 --> 33:49.992
I have the proof
you need right here.

33:56.928 --> 33:58.008
Hey, Kyle.

34:00.540 --> 34:02.230
- Everything all right?
- No, it's not.

34:04.317 --> 34:05.538
I'm driving in my car,

34:06.660 --> 34:07.801
turn on the radio,

34:08.922 --> 34:11.414
and I hear you tell the world that
Jordan Collier's a mass murderer.

34:11.514 --> 34:12.540
That is not what I said.

34:12.639 --> 34:14.933
I said that he was wrong
to hand out promicin.

34:15.464 --> 34:16.600
And that's what I believe.

34:16.713 --> 34:18.004
Everything that you are,

34:18.117 --> 34:20.540
this building you're standing in,
you owe it all to Jordan.

34:20.643 --> 34:22.201
You're willing to betray
him for some votes?

34:22.301 --> 34:24.808
Hey, I built this place
just as much as Jordan.

34:24.958 --> 34:27.474
He used my healing abilities
to raise money for it.

34:27.661 --> 34:29.371
He used me for a lot of things.

34:29.527 --> 34:30.574
Not anymore.

34:30.675 --> 34:32.902
I'm my own man now.
I make my own choices.

34:33.003 --> 34:34.648
Well, you're off to a great start.

34:35.824 --> 34:36.967
You're not only
betraying Jordan,

34:37.068 --> 34:38.482
you're betraying yourself.

34:39.993 --> 34:41.458
You're a traitor, Shawn.

34:41.918 --> 34:43.101
Don't you see that?

34:46.112 --> 34:47.344
Don't you see that?

34:48.656 --> 34:49.802
Traitor.

35:02.735 --> 35:03.940
How long has it been?

35:04.829 --> 35:06.797
Since the last time you asked,
about 10 minutes.

35:06.897 --> 35:09.551
Since your sister's been in there
with Mitchell, about two hours.

35:10.416 --> 35:12.519
Mitchell's been with ANEXXO
for what, 14 years?

35:12.641 --> 35:14.453
Imagine the secrets
he's saved up.

35:15.597 --> 35:16.930
We could be here all night.

35:24.272 --> 35:25.667
We got a signed confession.

35:25.767 --> 35:27.658
Whether it holds up in court
remains to be seen,

35:27.758 --> 35:29.402
but we've got enough
against him

35:29.502 --> 35:31.505
that at least a couple
of these charges should stick.

35:31.605 --> 35:33.856
And April?
I'm sorry, Diana.

35:34.305 --> 35:35.967
We have to take her
into custody.

35:37.907 --> 35:39.043
It's okay, Di.

35:40.094 --> 35:41.381
Everything's okay.

35:47.108 --> 35:49.324
I didn't say
I'd go for it either but...

35:49.471 --> 35:50.706
You must've been pretty convincing.

35:50.806 --> 35:52.030
Excuse me,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

35:52.130 --> 35:53.202
But I have been up all night

35:53.302 --> 35:55.197
and what we're doing
to April just isn't fair.

35:55.297 --> 35:56.640
She didn't have to come forward.

35:56.743 --> 35:58.358
Mitchell could be
a free man right now,

35:58.471 --> 36:00.484
instead of having his picture
plastered all over the papers.

36:00.584 --> 36:03.009
But non, she did the right thing,
and we're locking her up?

36:03.109 --> 36:06.164
We need to offer her some kind
of amnesty, not punish her.

36:06.264 --> 36:07.999
Skouris, we're not punishing her.

36:08.459 --> 36:09.501
We're hiring her.

36:12.108 --> 36:13.535
According to Meghan,

36:13.761 --> 36:16.467
NTAC...
The attorney general's office...

36:16.567 --> 36:17.837
The FBI...

36:18.109 --> 36:20.494
They're already fighting over
who gets me when.

36:21.165 --> 36:23.447
And all I have to do
is ask people questions.

36:23.860 --> 36:26.114
It's not always going to be
at a bar over drinks.

36:26.222 --> 36:27.306
Some of the people you meet

36:27.420 --> 36:28.922
and the questions
you have to ask...

36:29.025 --> 36:30.894
Some of the answers
you're going to hear...

36:31.665 --> 36:33.020
It can get pretty ugly.

36:33.318 --> 36:35.337
Meghan was pretty upfront
about that.

36:35.886 --> 36:37.970
Still, it's gotta be
better than prison.

36:38.531 --> 36:40.100
I must say,
the perks are pretty good.

36:40.200 --> 36:41.312
I get an apartment,

36:41.412 --> 36:43.382
a nice salary,
health insurance,

36:43.482 --> 36:45.085
even a clothing allowance.

36:45.864 --> 36:47.495
And let's not forget
Eric and Ralph.

36:47.595 --> 36:49.320
Or is it Ralph and Eric?

36:49.808 --> 36:51.056
I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

36:51.156 --> 36:52.742
Their job is to make sure

36:52.842 --> 36:54.374
I show up
wherever I need to be.

36:56.054 --> 36:58.693
Knowing me, it won't be
as easy as it sounds.

37:03.765 --> 37:05.662
You think I'm gonna
screw this up, don't you?

37:07.642 --> 37:10.629
April, maybe the question
you should be asking me is

37:10.729 --> 37:12.005
if I want you to succeed,

37:12.105 --> 37:14.168
and the answer
is a definite yes.

37:16.603 --> 37:18.828
Well, I'll try not to let
either one of us down.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.872
And I promise
to call or email

37:22.972 --> 37:24.594
and let you know
how I'm doing.

37:25.597 --> 37:26.742
So...

37:26.930 --> 37:28.141
When are you leaving?

37:28.301 --> 37:31.259
You know, for Spain,
or wherever you guys decide?

37:33.288 --> 37:34.396
I'm not leaving.

37:35.551 --> 37:37.729
I'm staying right
here in Seattle.

37:39.624 --> 37:40.816
Did I just say that?

37:42.534 --> 37:43.689
Does Ben know?

37:46.049 --> 37:49.363
No. I hadn't realized it
until just now.

37:51.721 --> 37:53.213
You're gonna
have to tell him.

37:56.565 --> 37:57.974
I'm really happy
for both of you.

37:58.074 --> 37:59.503
I really am. But...

38:00.513 --> 38:03.029
we're not leaving this table
until we've made a decision.

38:04.244 --> 38:06.151
Are we living in France or Spain?

38:10.675 --> 38:11.682
Neither.

38:14.552 --> 38:15.622
Diana?

38:16.618 --> 38:18.486
Don't hate me, Ben. Please.

38:19.904 --> 38:21.152
Oh, God...

38:24.605 --> 38:26.338
I quit work.
I went to Spain.

38:26.438 --> 38:28.231
I tried. I really tried.

38:28.564 --> 38:29.747
But I belong here.

38:30.818 --> 38:34.273
With Tom, and with NTAC,
the search for Collier.

38:37.123 --> 38:38.382
I'm a part of that.

38:39.311 --> 38:40.673
My daughter's a part of that.

38:42.025 --> 38:43.659
And now my sister is, too.

38:49.491 --> 38:50.721
So what happens to us?

38:51.763 --> 38:53.069
We go back to our own lives?

38:54.324 --> 38:55.489
Back to our work?

38:56.891 --> 38:59.295
What, see each other
a few days a month?

39:00.006 --> 39:01.057
For now.

39:04.922 --> 39:06.668
We could have
so much more, Diana.

39:10.059 --> 39:11.838
Maia said
that we'd get married.

39:12.829 --> 39:14.073
And Maia's never wrong.

39:15.771 --> 39:16.945
Well, I hope not.

39:21.715 --> 39:22.841
Me too.

39:37.501 --> 39:38.900
The lab report
you asked for.

39:40.684 --> 39:42.592
The one and only copy.

39:44.412 --> 39:46.237
Samples came back
positive for promicin.

39:46.528 --> 39:48.734
Someone's definitely
walking around with an ability.

39:59.094 --> 40:00.155
Thanks, Marco.

40:08.732 --> 40:10.882
"When the chosen
have taken the elixir

40:11.154 --> 40:13.530
"and proved their faith
in the Messiah,

40:14.271 --> 40:16.309
"then all will follow
in their wake.

40:16.702 --> 40:20.195
"Only then will the father
reveal his true face,

40:20.759 --> 40:24.008
"and paradise and the world
will be as one."

40:26.458 --> 40:28.307
I think that's a pretty
accurate translation.

40:28.432 --> 40:29.992
The elixir,
that's gotta be promicin.

40:30.092 --> 40:32.423
And we know Collier's
supposed to be the Messiah.

40:33.437 --> 40:34.545
And the father?

40:35.413 --> 40:37.010
I don't know. God, I guess?

40:37.545 --> 40:39.667
- But who are the chosen?
- Flip the page.

40:42.594 --> 40:43.975
It's a list of names.

40:44.424 --> 40:45.749
Yeah. 200 in all.

40:45.853 --> 40:48.005
And most of them
you'll recognize.

40:48.577 --> 40:50.981
Politicians, scientists,
athletes...

40:51.094 --> 40:52.990
These people,
they're all alive today.

40:54.465 --> 40:56.709
But this book was written
85 years ago.

40:56.943 --> 40:58.004
I know.

40:58.834 --> 41:00.130
All right, so...

41:00.499 --> 41:02.242
all these people
have to take the shot?

41:02.818 --> 41:03.823
And...

41:03.978 --> 41:05.990
That's supposed to influence
more and more people

41:06.090 --> 41:07.375
to do the same, right?

41:07.517 --> 41:09.761
Until what?
Everyone has an ability?

41:11.094 --> 41:12.690
Those who survive, anyway.

41:13.185 --> 41:15.035
And that's when god's
supposed to show up?

41:22.891 --> 41:24.726
I think you'd better look
at the last name.

41:34.478 --> 41:35.595
My dad?

41:39.082 --> 41:40.528
He has to take the shot?

41:41.090 --> 41:43.043
If you believe in the prophecy.

41:46.262 --> 41:47.627
In some kind of
paradise on earth

41:47.727 --> 41:49.086
led by Jordan Collier...

41:53.345 --> 41:54.453
Then, yeah...

41:56.296 --> 41:57.893
Your dad has to take promicin.
