01:04:00.757 --> 01:04:02.092
You know where the losers sit?

01:04:02.301 --> 01:04:03.886
ln the front of the bus, yeah.
That's right.

01:04:06.805 --> 01:04:08.557
How'd you like to scrum with that?

01:04:40.797 --> 01:04:42.049
RADlO ANNOUNCER:
Since the tragic death

01:04:42.132 --> 01:04:44.343
of team player
Kurt Addison eight weeks ago,

01:04:44.343 --> 01:04:47.554
this Highland team has been
nothing but unstoppable.

01:04:47.679 --> 01:04:50.057
They'll be returning home
with the regional title

01:04:50.182 --> 01:04:52.976
and be headed
to the USA Rugby Nationals

01:04:52.976 --> 01:04:54.561
later this month.

01:05:19.795 --> 01:05:22.089
What about you?
No family, Griggsie?

01:05:22.214 --> 01:05:23.757
No, my parents split up.

01:05:23.757 --> 01:05:24.925
My dad's in prison.

01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:26.677
My mom,
she's a stripper out in Vegas,

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.345
or Reno or something like that.

01:05:28.345 --> 01:05:29.930
l don't know. l don't remember.

01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:32.516
Man, l'm sorry. l thought
that l had it bad, but you --

01:05:32.641 --> 01:05:33.767
lt's all good.

01:05:35.644 --> 01:05:37.646
You loser. You lied?

01:05:37.855 --> 01:05:39.523
You know,
this little trust bridge we had here

01:05:39.523 --> 01:05:40.983
just burned
and went right down the river.

01:05:41.066 --> 01:05:42.860
But they're always late, so...

01:05:44.528 --> 01:05:46.280
Oh, look. It's my mother.

01:05:48.282 --> 01:05:50.367
That's a big mama.

01:05:50.993 --> 01:05:52.870
Ooh, put your tongue away, dude.

01:05:52.953 --> 01:05:56.290
She don't like the drooling,
'cause l already tried that.

01:05:56.206 --> 01:05:59.126
-Yeah, how long have they been--
-Together?

01:05:59.209 --> 01:06:01.420
-Yeah.
-Since birth.

01:06:02.129 --> 01:06:05.465
That's ''Q's'' sister Emily.
You did not know that?

01:06:05.465 --> 01:06:06.425
What?

01:06:07.968 --> 01:06:09.428
RICK: This has got even better.

01:06:09.428 --> 01:06:11.847
l wouldn't touch it, man.
She's twitchy as a bunch of nuns.

01:06:11.847 --> 01:06:13.807
-She's the Holy Grail.
-Yeah, uh-huh.

01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:15.684
l tried.

01:06:17.769 --> 01:06:21.857
You must be the sisters
that ''Q'' has been telling me about.

01:06:21.732 --> 01:06:22.691
What are you doing?

01:06:22.774 --> 01:06:25.486
No, l've never said a word
to him about you.

01:06:25.486 --> 01:06:26.945
Well, you should have.

01:06:26.945 --> 01:06:29.031
Yeah. You should have.

01:06:29.156 --> 01:06:31.116
No. l shouldn't have.

01:06:31.241 --> 01:06:32.493
Rick Penning.

01:06:32.576 --> 01:06:34.036
Emily Owens.

01:06:34.036 --> 01:06:35.829
You know,
l've been watching you play.

01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:37.581
You're actually really good.

01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:40.209
Well, thank you.
It's very nice of you to notice.

01:06:40.209 --> 01:06:41.877
-Oh, well--
-''Q'': We're going.

01:06:41.877 --> 01:06:43.837
Okay, l think l'm leaving now,

01:06:43.962 --> 01:06:45.422
but it was nice
to officially meet you!

01:06:45.506 --> 01:06:47.090
No, it wasn't.

01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:48.008
Hey, ''Q''!

01:06:48.217 --> 01:06:50.010
l'll see you tomorrow
at 4:OO for practice

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:51.678
where we usually
hang out afterwards

01:06:51.678 --> 01:06:53.430
and grab a bite to eat!

01:06:54.681 --> 01:06:56.350
You a pineapple, brother.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:57.810
What?

01:06:57.935 --> 01:07:01.063
All hard and ugly
and spiny on the outside.

01:07:00.938 --> 01:07:02.606
Nothing but sweet
and mushy under.

01:07:02.731 --> 01:07:03.982
Oh, you got it bad.

01:07:03.982 --> 01:07:05.859
lt's not even like that, brah.

01:07:06.777 --> 01:07:08.237
You know, you guys
are going to nationals.

01:07:08.362 --> 01:07:10.447
Making Marcus
one happy brother.

01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:19.206
Hey.

01:07:20.123 --> 01:07:22.960
Dad!
What are you doing here?

01:07:23.877 --> 01:07:25.546
l'm taking you home.

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:30.133
Marcus, l told you l wanted
to finish out the season.

01:07:30.133 --> 01:07:30.968
l know,

01:07:30.968 --> 01:07:34.012
but based on the last two
positive evaluations l gave you,

01:07:34.012 --> 01:07:36.515
the iudge released you
from the wardship,

01:07:36.515 --> 01:07:39.726
placing you back
in the custody of your parents.

01:07:40.686 --> 01:07:41.812
So what does that mean?

01:07:41.812 --> 01:07:43.689
lt means grab your stuff.
You're coming home.

01:07:43.814 --> 01:07:46.316
Dad, l can't.
l'm the team captain!

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.736
You're still the captain,
of the Razorbacks.

01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:55.492
l'm sorry.
Look, see the positive here.

01:07:55.576 --> 01:07:57.161
You did it.

01:07:57.161 --> 01:08:00.914
You got probation. You're
not going to a county lockdown.

01:08:00.914 --> 01:08:03.208
Thanks for everything.

01:08:03.709 --> 01:08:06.336
Okay. Okay. That's real sweet.

01:08:06.336 --> 01:08:07.796
This isn't summer camp.
Let's go.

01:08:09.256 --> 01:08:11.425
You keep listening right, okay?

01:08:15.929 --> 01:08:17.055
All right, Bingham.

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:20.100
Enough with the kumbayahs,
all right?

01:08:25.314 --> 01:08:26.439
Nice.

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.778
lt's good to have you home.

01:08:32.488 --> 01:08:33.654
Thanks.

01:08:33.654 --> 01:08:35.616
You know, tomorrow at practice,

01:08:35.823 --> 01:08:38.952
Rick is gonna
Iay out Highland's playbook.

01:08:38.868 --> 01:08:41.162
You know, whatever you've got
that you think we need,

01:08:41.162 --> 01:08:47.002
you know, specific plays,
zoning, substitution strategies,

01:08:47.002 --> 01:08:48.045
you just let it rip, okay?

01:08:54.091 --> 01:08:56.261
You know, we're gonna
end up playing against them

01:08:56.386 --> 01:08:58.055
at Colorado Springs.

01:09:01.058 --> 01:09:03.894
This is our year.

01:09:04.394 --> 01:09:06.188
We deserve that title.

01:09:06.188 --> 01:09:08.482
What do you mean ''we''?

01:09:09.316 --> 01:09:11.193
My team is Highland.

01:09:11.193 --> 01:09:14.529
Okay, you see,
you don't get to choose.

01:09:14.822 --> 01:09:17.866
You will leave this house or not
if we say.

01:09:17.866 --> 01:09:20.368
You will drive that car or not
if we say.

01:09:20.368 --> 01:09:22.662
You will go to Colorado or not
if l say,

01:09:22.662 --> 01:09:24.747
and right now l say
that you will be at practice

01:09:24.747 --> 01:09:26.707
with your Razorbacks tomorrow.

01:09:26.834 --> 01:09:28.167
Rick, sit down.

01:09:28.292 --> 01:09:30.462
Have me arrested.

01:09:32.339 --> 01:09:34.341
What was that about?

01:09:35.259 --> 01:09:37.261
What did l say wrong?

01:09:39.138 --> 01:09:41.014
He's been gone a year,

01:09:41.932 --> 01:09:43.809
and the only thing
you can talk about

01:09:43.809 --> 01:09:46.728
is having him teach
some stupid plays to your team?

01:09:46.728 --> 01:09:48.814
Stupid plays? Okay, look.
It's his team, too.

01:09:50.274 --> 01:09:51.733
Didn't you hear him?

01:09:51.733 --> 01:09:54.236
The Razorbacks
aren't his team anymore.

01:09:54.236 --> 01:09:56.321
He doesn't know
what he wants anymore, honey.

01:09:57.156 --> 01:09:59.449
Have you asked him?

01:10:02.077 --> 01:10:05.414
l only want him
to have what l never had.

01:10:07.291 --> 01:10:13.046
And what makes you think
that he wants what you never had?

01:10:12.921 --> 01:10:15.007
What about what he wants?

01:10:15.132 --> 01:10:17.926
What he wants landed him in iail.

01:10:19.386 --> 01:10:21.054
What is more important, Richard?

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:23.765
A game or two or your son?

01:10:23.765 --> 01:10:25.976
Look at him.

01:10:26.477 --> 01:10:28.562
lf playing for this team

01:10:28.562 --> 01:10:34.610
is making him more like the man
that we want him to be,

01:10:34.526 --> 01:10:36.904
if it's making him happy --

01:10:37.029 --> 01:10:39.823
lt's in his eyes.

01:10:40.449 --> 01:10:43.994
Just open yours, and you'll see it.

01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:54.004
Okay, l'll try. Okay?

01:10:54.213 --> 01:11:00.594
You try. You sit.
This is about doing, Coach.

01:12:15.252 --> 01:12:17.004
Hey, Rick!

01:12:17.337 --> 01:12:18.172
What's up, man?

01:12:18.255 --> 01:12:20.340
What's up, man?
When did you get back?

01:12:24.219 --> 01:12:25.679
Here, let me look at you.

01:12:27.014 --> 01:12:29.099
Oh, Tami, l'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

01:12:29.224 --> 01:12:31.185
l'm fine.
l just want you to kiss me.

01:12:31.727 --> 01:12:33.395
Oh, Tami, come on.

01:12:33.479 --> 01:12:35.564
Baby, what's wrong?
Aren't you excited to see me?

01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:37.232
Tami, please.

01:12:38.484 --> 01:12:41.111
Guys, l'm on probation, man.

01:12:41.195 --> 01:12:43.280
You guys got to lose this.
Put it in the truck or something.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:44.448
Oh, come on, Mr. Paranoid.

01:12:44.448 --> 01:12:46.200
You really see a probation schmo
around here?

01:12:46.325 --> 01:12:47.159
TAMl: l missed you.

01:12:47.242 --> 01:12:48.619
-No.
-Lars.

01:12:48.702 --> 01:12:51.121
Lars, l'm serious, man.
Don't put it in here.

01:12:51.538 --> 01:12:53.707
Okay, well, you're still taking us
for a little ride afterward.

01:12:53.707 --> 01:12:54.958
Come on, man.
You owe us one.

01:12:55.918 --> 01:12:57.586
Rick, this is it.

01:12:57.586 --> 01:12:59.254
This is our year!

01:12:59.546 --> 01:13:00.506
This is it!

01:13:00.589 --> 01:13:03.091
-Am l right?
-Absolutely.

01:13:03.091 --> 01:13:05.511
Seriously, though, the team --
We're pure stoked

01:13:05.594 --> 01:13:07.596
to have you back to give us
the Highland hookup

01:13:07.596 --> 01:13:09.264
on all their plays and stuff.

01:13:09.264 --> 01:13:11.767
You want the Highland hookup?

01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:13.936
One, there's none of this, all right?

01:13:14.061 --> 01:13:16.230
lt's about character and honor.

01:13:17.898 --> 01:13:19.566
What's he talking about?

01:13:19.691 --> 01:13:21.360
l'm sorry, uh...

01:13:22.277 --> 01:13:23.862
...character and honor?

01:13:23.862 --> 01:13:27.491
Yeah, and we also don't do anything
to embarrass ourselves, our families,

01:13:27.491 --> 01:13:28.742
or our team.

01:13:28.867 --> 01:13:29.785
Hey! Whoa!

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:32.621
What, so, you don't drink now?

01:13:34.581 --> 01:13:36.875
Rick, you're talking
like you still play for them.

01:13:36.875 --> 01:13:39.086
You want to know what Highland
teaches? Well, l'm telling you.

01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:41.880
Yeah, yeah, we want plays.
Maybe illegal hits.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.549
You really think we want you
to come around here

01:13:43.674 --> 01:13:45.551
and start teaching Sunday School?

01:13:45.634 --> 01:13:47.010
Come on, man.
This ain't you.

01:13:47.636 --> 01:13:49.304
You know what, guys?

01:13:49.304 --> 01:13:50.222
l'm going to practice.

01:13:50.973 --> 01:13:53.892
Lars, man,
Iet's just get out of here.

01:13:54.309 --> 01:13:57.229
Well, the old Rick used to take it
any way he could get it.

01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:58.355
You should suck it up.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.232
Rick, what's wrong with you?

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:05.154
What's happened to you, Rick?

01:14:05.154 --> 01:14:06.280
Where's the loyalty, man?

01:14:06.405 --> 01:14:08.782
l mean, we've been talking about
beating Highland for the title

01:14:08.907 --> 01:14:09.825
since we were little kids.

01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:11.285
Lars, man,
Iet's just go, all right?

01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:12.035
Let's just go, okay?

01:14:12.244 --> 01:14:13.704
Highland is a bunch
of choir boys, Rick!

01:14:13.787 --> 01:14:15.664
Yeah, and you're drunk.

01:14:15.664 --> 01:14:16.832
So?

01:14:16.915 --> 01:14:18.792
So, we're not doing this.
l'm going to practice.

01:14:18.792 --> 01:14:19.543
No, Rick. Come on!

01:14:19.626 --> 01:14:21.920
LARS: All right, well, maybe we
just don't want you at practice.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.840
Maybe you should, uh, hightail it
back to Highland, huh?

01:14:28.802 --> 01:14:31.013
GIRL: Lars, don't be an idiot!

01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:34.141
TAMl: Come on, you guys!

01:14:34.224 --> 01:14:36.643
You know, a year ago you
would have killed me for that.

01:14:37.686 --> 01:14:40.481
l said, ''l'm not doing this.''

01:14:40.481 --> 01:14:41.648
LARS: No...

01:14:41.648 --> 01:14:44.568
TAMl: Lars! Stop!
You guys, stop!

01:14:44.568 --> 01:14:45.486
Get a little zip on that thing.

01:14:45.694 --> 01:14:46.653
Get off of him!

01:14:46.945 --> 01:14:48.530
TAMl: Stop, you guys!

01:14:48.614 --> 01:14:49.239
Get off him, man!

01:14:50.199 --> 01:14:51.950
lt's the cops! It's the cops!

01:14:56.455 --> 01:14:57.706
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

01:15:05.005 --> 01:15:07.007
Back lines! Let's go!

01:15:07.007 --> 01:15:08.550
Move it! Go!

01:15:26.902 --> 01:15:32.533
l give you the keys to the car,
and this is what l get.

01:15:36.912 --> 01:15:40.165
After what l've been through
the last year,

01:15:40.165 --> 01:15:41.083
do you really believe

01:15:41.208 --> 01:15:44.336
that l'd be messing with drugs
and booze the day l get home?

01:15:44.336 --> 01:15:50.175
Okay, there were drugs and beer
all over you and the car.

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:51.718
lt was Lars and Marty.

01:15:51.718 --> 01:15:54.429
Test me.
l haven't had a drink in a year.

01:15:54.555 --> 01:15:59.852
Rick, do you have any idea
how much potential you had?

01:15:59.768 --> 01:16:01.937
Lars set me up!

01:16:01.937 --> 01:16:03.939
See, my future was stolen.

01:16:03.939 --> 01:16:05.274
You're not even listening.

01:16:05.399 --> 01:16:06.942
FATH E R:
And what are you doing?

01:16:06.942 --> 01:16:09.027
You're just throwing it all away?
For what? Drugs?

01:16:09.027 --> 01:16:09.987
Booze? Some girl?

01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:11.947
So, l guess what l said really
doesn't even make a difference.

01:16:11.947 --> 01:16:15.826
Rick, it kills me to sit back and
watch you throw everything away.

01:16:15.826 --> 01:16:16.952
l mean,
when are you gonna dig deep

01:16:16.952 --> 01:16:18.829
and first-string
the real Rick Penning?

01:16:19.663 --> 01:16:22.291
You want to talk
about first-stringing a Penning?

01:16:22.291 --> 01:16:24.585
You won nationals in 1 986.

01:16:24.585 --> 01:16:26.753
You were on the original
Highland Rugby team!

01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:30.924
You were
a Highland Rugby player.

01:16:34.595 --> 01:16:36.555
l didn't win anything.

01:16:36.555 --> 01:16:39.266
You were on the team.
You know what they taught.

01:16:40.726 --> 01:16:41.977
l was on nothing.

01:16:41.977 --> 01:16:44.897
l saw your picture, Dad.
You were on the team.

01:16:45.022 --> 01:16:48.650
No. Gelwix made sure
that l wasn't on that team

01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:51.278
by putting me someplace
that l shouldn't have been.

01:16:53.238 --> 01:16:54.281
l told him,

01:16:55.532 --> 01:17:00.120
but he insisted
that l play a forward.

01:17:00.662 --> 01:17:02.831
He was doing what was best
for you and the team.

01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:05.125
No, no, Gelwix stole my life!

01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:08.378
Well, he's given me mine back!

01:17:17.137 --> 01:17:19.306
l play for Highland.

01:17:19.848 --> 01:17:22.851
l am benched
for drugs and alcohol,

01:17:22.851 --> 01:17:25.562
suspended for lying.

01:17:25.771 --> 01:17:34.321
l don't do anything to embarrass
myself, my team, or my family.

01:17:34.112 --> 01:17:36.406
Not anymore.

01:17:37.032 --> 01:17:39.034
Highland Rugby.

01:17:39.117 --> 01:17:41.119
Kia kaha.

01:17:41.537 --> 01:17:43.080
l'm done.

01:17:49.253 --> 01:17:50.921
Rick.

01:17:51.421 --> 01:17:52.464
Rick.

01:17:53.423 --> 01:17:54.550
Rick!

01:18:02.599 --> 01:18:04.768
He was caught with the drugs, Larry.

01:18:05.394 --> 01:18:08.230
He was changing.
You saw it. We all saw it.

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:09.773
Well, that's why
l fought with the courts

01:18:09.773 --> 01:18:11.233
to try and keep him at Wasatch.

01:18:11.358 --> 01:18:13.026
When l heard
they were discharging him,

01:18:13.026 --> 01:18:14.069
l told them he wasn't ready.

01:18:14.153 --> 01:18:18.949
Maybe you both should have
a little bit more faith in him.

01:18:18.949 --> 01:18:20.325
Maybe.

01:18:26.248 --> 01:18:29.084
-Good night, Coach.
-Good night.

01:18:29.376 --> 01:18:32.921
l know how much
you cared about this boy.

01:18:35.966 --> 01:18:38.552
And when l can't help
these young men

01:18:38.552 --> 01:18:42.222
become champions
in their own lives, it's...

01:18:49.813 --> 01:18:53.150
Maybe it is time.

01:19:16.006 --> 01:19:18.801
You're out, man.
Come on. Let's go.

01:19:19.218 --> 01:19:20.469
Move it!

01:19:26.517 --> 01:19:27.684
Mom.

01:19:27.768 --> 01:19:29.436
Tami, what's going on?

01:19:30.187 --> 01:19:31.522
Larry Gelwix called.

01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:34.024
We talked for a long time.

01:19:34.024 --> 01:19:35.400
He wouldn't let me off the phone

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.361
until l promised
to do some digging.

01:19:38.529 --> 01:19:41.240
Tami told the police
what really happened.

01:19:42.074 --> 01:19:44.451
l thought you were with Lars
and Marty on this.

01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:47.996
Maybe l didn't want
to hold you back anymore.

01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:53.126
Where's Dad?

01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:56.672
Your dad thought
you might be able to use this.

01:19:58.549 --> 01:20:02.928
He also said that he knew you
wouldn't be able to respect him

01:20:02.803 --> 01:20:06.598
unless he still tried
to beat Highland,

01:20:06.598 --> 01:20:08.684
even with you as their hook.

01:20:14.106 --> 01:20:16.483
Let's get out of here.

01:20:17.234 --> 01:20:18.777
Thanks, Tami.

01:20:21.071 --> 01:20:21.071
USA Rugby welcomes you

01:20:21.071 --> 01:20:23.073

01:20:36.837 --> 01:20:38.714
plus two at-large entries.

01:20:41.425 --> 01:20:42.259

.. .between East Lansing
and Highland.

01:20:47.473 --> 01:20:48.515
What's up, brother?

01:20:48.599 --> 01:20:50.392
-Come on, guys.
-What's up, brah?

01:20:50.601 --> 01:20:53.812
-Coach!
-Hey, Penning. Welcome back.

01:20:53.812 --> 01:20:55.272
Welcome back.

01:20:56.732 --> 01:20:58.734
Glad you're here, Rick.

01:21:00.068 --> 01:21:01.028
Thanks for having me back.

01:21:01.111 --> 01:21:02.279
All right,
Iook around, gentlemen.

01:21:02.279 --> 01:21:04.239
This is what you've been chasing.

01:21:04.364 --> 01:21:05.616
Now, l want it clean,

01:21:05.699 --> 01:21:08.535
but these guys need to know
that they don't belong here.

01:21:08.619 --> 01:21:11.330
l want you to hit 'em so hard,
you make 'em cry.

01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:12.372
You hearing me, Peeta?

01:21:12.372 --> 01:21:13.415
Yes, Coach.

01:21:13.749 --> 01:21:14.875
Make 'em cry.

01:21:27.596 --> 01:21:29.264
Yeah! Way to go, buddy!

01:21:35.646 --> 01:21:38.148
ANNOUNCER: Highland is just
chewing East Lansing up

01:21:38.148 --> 01:21:39.066
and spitting them out.

01:21:39.191 --> 01:21:41.568
l tell you, Max, you do not
want to give Highland an inch

01:21:41.693 --> 01:21:43.862
because they will
take the whole mile.

01:21:43.987 --> 01:21:47.616
This game is over.
Highland cleans house, 61-3.

01:21:50.869 --> 01:21:52.538
Who's missing a tooth?

01:21:52.538 --> 01:21:53.789
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:21:53.872 --> 01:21:56.291
the next match
will begin in 1 5 minutes

01:21:56.375 --> 01:22:00.045
between Akron United
and San Mateo Ravens.

01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:06.385
And so 16 teams are cut to 8,
Ieaving the 1 and 2 seeds,

01:22:06.385 --> 01:22:08.887
the flagstaff
and Highland teams advancing.

01:22:10.681 --> 01:22:12.015
LARS: Hey!

01:22:14.226 --> 01:22:15.978
lf it isn't the Highland choir boys.

01:22:15.978 --> 01:22:17.229
Knock it off, Lars.

01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:19.648
We're just surprised to see you
out in the free world, Penning.

01:22:19.731 --> 01:22:21.400
You know, we're actually
hoping you guys keep winning,

01:22:21.525 --> 01:22:23.902
so we can play you in the finals,

01:22:23.902 --> 01:22:26.196
because you will become
a very popular guy.

01:22:26.196 --> 01:22:27.030
What's it up to now?

01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:29.533
lt's like --
What do we got? 235?

01:22:29.533 --> 01:22:32.369
$235 to whoever
takes you out of the game.

01:22:32.452 --> 01:22:33.620
ls that right?

01:22:33.704 --> 01:22:34.663
You...

01:22:34.663 --> 01:22:36.206
Uh, Peeta? It's okay.

01:22:37.374 --> 01:22:40.085
Come on, brah. Let's go! Let's go!
It's not even worth it, man.

01:22:40.794 --> 01:22:42.171
Not even worth it.

01:22:44.339 --> 01:22:46.550
Trembling there a little bit, Lars.

01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:48.093
Yeah, l think l peed just a little bit.

01:22:48.218 --> 01:22:49.344
Just a little.

01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:50.596
This is six!

01:22:51.847 --> 01:22:54.141
ANNOUNCER: Highland steals
the ball and passes it out.

01:22:54.141 --> 01:22:56.351
They hit the gap and took it.

01:22:57.811 --> 01:22:59.897
Boy, just look at Swindle
breaking the line

01:22:59.897 --> 01:23:01.023
and putting on the gas.

01:23:01.148 --> 01:23:03.442
He is making some serious yards.

01:23:17.915 --> 01:23:20.000
And we have a ruck
in the midfield.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.793
Oh, a quick ball out.

01:23:23.754 --> 01:23:25.756
There's a kick ahead.
And there it is.

01:23:26.673 --> 01:23:28.258
Highland's fullback, Quentin Owens,

01:23:28.258 --> 01:23:30.219
sweeps it up
for some easy try time.

01:23:30.219 --> 01:23:32.095
This is a big cleanup
by Highland.

01:23:32.221 --> 01:23:35.432
They're very, very serious
contenders in this tournament.

01:23:38.685 --> 01:23:40.020
That was for me.

01:23:43.482 --> 01:23:44.817
Good evening.

01:24:02.459 --> 01:24:03.919
That worked, yeah?

01:24:04.127 --> 01:24:05.796
You guys are sick.

01:24:48.547 --> 01:24:49.590
GRIGGS:
No, get back in, Mark.

01:24:49.673 --> 01:24:50.924
They're coming.
They're coming. They're coming.

01:24:58.557 --> 01:25:00.142
MARK: Griggsie?

01:25:01.351 --> 01:25:03.061
Griggs, are you there?

01:25:04.104 --> 01:25:07.524
Griggs, let me out of here, man!
Come on! This ain't funny!

01:25:07.441 --> 01:25:09.193
OTHERS: Yee-hah!

01:25:09.401 --> 01:25:11.695
MARK: Griggsie,
get back here, man!

01:25:11.695 --> 01:25:13.572
Coach, any predictions
on the match?

01:25:13.697 --> 01:25:16.492
Oh, we're looking forward
to the challenge.

01:25:16.492 --> 01:25:18.577
My boys have worked
very hard to get here,

01:25:18.577 --> 01:25:20.037
and may the best team win.

01:25:20.037 --> 01:25:22.873
l understand your son
is playing for Highland.

01:25:22.873 --> 01:25:26.293
What's it going to be like
coaching against him?

01:25:26.418 --> 01:25:27.044
Uh...

01:25:27.252 --> 01:25:29.755
Coach, is it true you used to play
for this Highland team?

01:25:31.507 --> 01:25:33.175
Thank you.

01:25:35.385 --> 01:25:37.888
Pizza time, baby!

01:25:44.436 --> 01:25:46.313
lt's more fun
when you turn it on, brah.

01:25:48.106 --> 01:25:51.109
Hey, uh, why don't you guys

01:25:51.109 --> 01:25:53.320
go torment some menace
in the hallway or something?

01:25:56.114 --> 01:25:58.116
GRIGGS: All right. Hurry up.
Peeta eat it all.

01:25:58.116 --> 01:25:59.785
Hey, let's go
watch Sanchez work out!

01:25:59.868 --> 01:26:01.662
TEAMMATE:
Sanchez works out?

01:26:07.584 --> 01:26:09.795
And l have a 4.O GPA.

01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:12.589
You want to talk
about your grades?

01:26:23.225 --> 01:26:25.936
For the last year and a half,

01:26:26.061 --> 01:26:30.232
l've been paying guys
to get test answers for me.

01:26:35.112 --> 01:26:39.408
You know, l have lived
my whole life for my parents.

01:26:39.408 --> 01:26:42.953
Line by line,
what they wanted me to do.

01:26:43.996 --> 01:26:47.833
Highland Rugby is the only thing
that l do for me.

01:26:48.250 --> 01:26:50.878
l mean, l have lived
the last four years of my life

01:26:50.878 --> 01:26:53.881
so that l can play as a senior
for the national title.

01:26:57.426 --> 01:26:59.094
And here it is.

01:26:59.219 --> 01:27:03.056
And l'm this close.

01:27:06.810 --> 01:27:10.063
l'm trying to stay true to my parents,

01:27:09.938 --> 01:27:12.858
l haven't been true
to the one thing

01:27:12.858 --> 01:27:15.360
that means the most to me...

01:27:22.868 --> 01:27:25.996
...my brothers on the team.

01:27:31.335 --> 01:27:37.591
l'm sorry. l just, uh,
had to tell somebody, you know?

01:27:50.187 --> 01:27:51.980
You're not gonna tell coach, are you?

01:27:53.857 --> 01:27:56.235
That's not my iob.

01:27:58.237 --> 01:27:59.905
Right.

01:28:07.496 --> 01:28:09.164
G E LWIX:
''Q'' just came to see me.

01:28:09.373 --> 01:28:11.458
Thanks for being
a positive influence on him.

01:28:11.583 --> 01:28:14.086
-RICK: That's funny.
-GELWIX: No, no. It's true.

01:28:18.257 --> 01:28:19.716
And you gonna play him?

01:28:22.302 --> 01:28:24.096
GELWIX: What do you think?

01:28:25.639 --> 01:28:27.224
Well...

01:28:27.641 --> 01:28:29.309
...he is a captain.

01:28:29.601 --> 01:28:33.272
And he scores most of our points.

01:28:33.981 --> 01:28:36.191
Might not win without him.

01:28:36.817 --> 01:28:39.736
Glad l'm not the coach right now.

01:28:39.945 --> 01:28:42.030
l'm glad l'm not Quentin's father
right now.

01:28:42.030 --> 01:28:44.408
He just flew in for the finals.

01:28:53.792 --> 01:28:54.751
When l was 13,

01:28:54.835 --> 01:28:58.797
my father went with me
to a father-and-son dinner.

01:29:00.799 --> 01:29:05.053
lt was the only time he ever went
with me to anything like that.

01:29:05.262 --> 01:29:06.096
One time.

01:29:12.144 --> 01:29:14.354
l never knew if he cared.

01:29:14.354 --> 01:29:19.568
l took his absence
as a lack of love.

01:29:19.443 --> 01:29:23.405
l never felt like l was good enough.
Never felt like l measured up.

01:29:24.031 --> 01:29:29.244
And it took me 40 years
to forgive him.

01:29:29.786 --> 01:29:31.663
And when you got arrested...

01:29:31.663 --> 01:29:38.337
...l told the lovely Mrs. Gelwix,
''lt's time to retire.''

01:29:41.673 --> 01:29:44.051
Then l got a call from your father.

01:29:45.135 --> 01:29:48.889
lt was the first time we talked
since that 1 986 season.

01:29:49.723 --> 01:29:52.726
And he said that the son
he lost a year ago

01:29:52.726 --> 01:29:55.854
wasn't the same one
he found sitting in jail.

01:29:57.231 --> 01:29:59.942
You're where l was 40 years ago.

01:30:01.151 --> 01:30:05.781
Don't spend another minute
being angry about yesterday.

01:30:05.656 --> 01:30:08.158
Free him, and you free yourself.

01:30:13.997 --> 01:30:15.999
Better get some sleep.

01:30:17.543 --> 01:30:19.628
Big game tomorrow.

01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:22.881

Flagstaff versus Highland --

01:30:47.489 --> 01:30:51.034

01:30:51.535 --> 01:30:52.161

01:30:58.208 --> 01:31:01.879
l wanted to say thank you
for what you did for ''Q.''

01:31:01.962 --> 01:31:05.299
He said you took the time
to listen, and you're a real friend.

01:31:05.507 --> 01:31:06.675
He said that?

01:31:09.052 --> 01:31:10.721
Well, you're welcome.

01:31:13.432 --> 01:31:17.519
Well, l'll be right there,

01:31:17.603 --> 01:31:20.439
sitting in the Rick Penning
fan section.

01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:23.358

Good luck.

01:31:32.534 --> 01:31:34.077
Uh, yeah.

01:31:34.828 --> 01:31:36.914
You can count on that.

01:31:43.587 --> 01:31:46.089
-Hey, wrong bench, Penning.
-Look who it is.

01:31:46.089 --> 01:31:47.216
-Sweat it.
-What's up, traitor?

01:31:47.341 --> 01:31:48.884
-Rick.
-Welcome back.

01:31:48.884 --> 01:31:51.512
Hey, you don't belong
over here, traitor.

01:31:57.017 --> 01:31:58.393
You shouldn't be over here.

01:32:00.354 --> 01:32:04.858
l just wanted to say
that l'm sorry.

01:32:06.610 --> 01:32:10.781
l'm sorry for being a disappointment
to you and Mom.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:18.413
l'm sorry l wasn't able to be more
like what you wanted me to be.

01:32:21.625 --> 01:32:23.627
Son, uh...

01:32:27.047 --> 01:32:28.841
lt hasn't been just you.

01:32:36.223 --> 01:32:39.059
l also need to forgive you.

01:32:42.062 --> 01:32:44.565
Kia kaha.

01:32:50.195 --> 01:32:52.698
You will play your best game, right?

01:32:52.698 --> 01:32:53.866
Let's go!

01:32:57.411 --> 01:32:59.371
Better stay on your toes, Rick.

01:32:59.496 --> 01:33:01.790
There's 280 bucks on your head.

01:33:01.874 --> 01:33:04.084
You're going down and out, pal.

01:33:09.089 --> 01:33:10.841
Why's he smiling?

01:33:12.301 --> 01:33:14.928
Let's crack open his head
and find out.

01:33:38.076 --> 01:33:40.370
Ka mate! Ka mate!

01:33:40.454 --> 01:33:41.914
ALL: Ka ora! Ka ora!

01:33:41.914 --> 01:33:44.750
Ka mate! Ka mate!
Ka ora! Ka ora!

01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:47.753
Tenei te tangata
Puhuru huru

01:33:47.753 --> 01:33:51.298
Nana i tiki mai
Whakawhiti te ra

01:33:51.215 --> 01:33:53.592
A, upa... ne!
A, upa... ne!

01:33:53.592 --> 01:33:58.514
A upane, ka upane
Whiti te ra... Hi!

01:34:25.415 --> 01:34:26.458
Get it wide! Get it wide!

01:34:39.054 --> 01:34:42.432
ANNOUNCER:
At the 6:07 mark in the first half,

01:34:42.516 --> 01:34:45.519
the score --
Highland, 5, flagstaff, O.

01:34:59.741 --> 01:35:00.784
That was a cheap hit!

01:35:00.784 --> 01:35:03.162
-Keep the tackles low.
-Oh, come on!

01:35:03.162 --> 01:35:04.329
Number 7, 10 in the bench.

01:35:04.413 --> 01:35:05.164
ANNOUNCER:
Your attention please.

01:35:05.372 --> 01:35:08.083
Yellow-card caution issued
to Razorbacks number 7.

01:35:17.468 --> 01:35:19.219
Let's go! Support, support!

01:36:40.884 --> 01:36:43.887
Now, it's not really known
why Highland is going without

01:36:43.887 --> 01:36:46.515
their star fullback,
Quentin Owens today

01:36:46.515 --> 01:36:47.558
but the loss, l'm telling you,

01:36:47.766 --> 01:36:49.643
has got to be felt
by the rest of the team.

01:37:01.405 --> 01:37:03.407
And that conversion
by Highland right there

01:37:03.407 --> 01:37:04.449
ties us back up,

01:37:04.658 --> 01:37:07.870
so it's Highland, 14,
flagstaff, 14.

01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:09.329
lt is anybody's game.

01:37:12.249 --> 01:37:13.500
Ruck over! Ruck over!

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.586
And Highland puts on the skills
and makes their move.

01:37:15.711 --> 01:37:18.213
Oh, they get the turnover
and kick it out.

01:37:18.297 --> 01:37:19.756
Cover the line! Cover the line!

01:37:19.965 --> 01:37:22.384
And the line-out
goes to Arizona at the 22.

01:37:23.844 --> 01:37:26.346
They're killing us out there, dude.
We've got to take Penning out.

01:37:26.346 --> 01:37:28.515
All right. You go high.

01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:29.766
Oh, yeah!

01:37:29.892 --> 01:37:31.643
Straight line! Line it up!

01:37:32.394 --> 01:37:33.645
Hey, hey, hey!

01:37:33.645 --> 01:37:34.897
-Throw it to Penning.
-What?

01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:36.231
Get it right to him.

01:37:37.399 --> 01:37:39.151
Back to first jumper!

01:37:39.151 --> 01:37:41.236
Switch out on me.

01:37:42.905 --> 01:37:46.783
Watch the ball! Watch the ball!
Watch it!

01:38:09.932 --> 01:38:11.600
-That'll be 1 O minutes.
-Oh, come on!

01:38:11.683 --> 01:38:12.643
REFEREE: Ten minutes!

01:38:12.726 --> 01:38:14.186
That's a red card!

01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:16.688
Colton, the Razorbacks
are getting off easy

01:38:16.688 --> 01:38:18.899
with a yellow card
and 1 O minutes in the sin-bin.

01:38:18.899 --> 01:38:20.567
l tell you, if it were me,
l'd be sitting the kid.

01:38:22.653 --> 01:38:24.196
280, boy! 280!

01:38:24.321 --> 01:38:26.406
COACH PENNING: Marty!
You're out. Sit.

01:38:26.406 --> 01:38:27.658
-What are you talking about?
-You're through.

01:38:27.741 --> 01:38:28.909
Hey, come on.
We're gonna lose without Marty.

01:38:28.992 --> 01:38:32.746
One more word out of you,
and you'll be sitting with him.

01:38:34.414 --> 01:38:36.625
Everybody stand back.
Let me check him out.

01:38:36.708 --> 01:38:37.960
G E LWIX:
Back off, guys. Back off.

01:38:38.085 --> 01:38:40.045
Give him some room, okay?

01:38:41.630 --> 01:38:42.756
All right, take it easy, Rick.

01:38:42.965 --> 01:38:44.216
Doc's gonna have a look at you, son.

01:38:44.341 --> 01:38:45.175
Okay, l'm gonna check your neck.

01:38:45.259 --> 01:38:48.303
Just lay still. Lay still, okay?
You'll be okay.

01:38:49.221 --> 01:38:50.472
l think he's gonna be okay.

01:38:50.597 --> 01:38:54.852
Coach, uh, can l...?
Can l, um...?

01:38:55.185 --> 01:38:56.311
Thank you.

01:39:02.276 --> 01:39:03.402
Hey.

01:39:05.904 --> 01:39:08.824
Look, Rick,
you have a choice here.

01:39:09.658 --> 01:39:13.328
You either get up
and finish this game,

01:39:13.328 --> 01:39:15.706
or you stay down...

01:39:16.248 --> 01:39:17.708
...and you end up like me.

01:40:05.047 --> 01:40:07.966
ANNOUNCER: _nd he breaks
the line and turns on the power.

01:40:08.091 --> 01:40:10.594
He outsmarts them all
and takes it to the line,

01:40:10.594 --> 01:40:14.139
so it's Highland, 1 9,
flagstaff, 14.

01:40:17.476 --> 01:40:19.436
And with time just under 5 minutes,

01:40:19.436 --> 01:40:22.356
it is still a toss-up
as to who will win this game.

01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:31.740
Come on, pass it out! Let's go!

01:40:37.496 --> 01:40:39.248
ANNOUNCER:
Number 1 1's got the moves,

01:40:39.248 --> 01:40:41.041
and he's got the 5 points!

01:40:41.125 --> 01:40:42.793
That is the third try for Arizona,

01:40:42.918 --> 01:40:45.420
and the second try
for Lars Murphy in this game.

01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:47.172
ANNOUNCER:
Arizona's back in business!

01:40:47.172 --> 01:40:50.092
That was the try that can
turn this entire game around.

01:40:50.092 --> 01:40:51.468
Both teams are playing very well

01:40:51.552 --> 01:40:53.637
under the extreme pressure
for the title.

01:40:59.184 --> 01:41:02.187
ANNOUNCER: Now this score has
guaranteed us a real cliffhanger

01:41:02.187 --> 01:41:05.941
as we move into the last two
minutes of this intense match.

01:41:37.639 --> 01:41:39.433
There we go! There we go!
Come on!

01:41:50.152 --> 01:41:52.029
Go, Rick. Go, Rick!

01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:57.576
Pick it up! Come on!

01:42:04.124 --> 01:42:05.709
Go! Go, Rick!

01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:09.880
Run!

01:42:18.222 --> 01:42:21.558
Penning is down at the try line
in a huge pileup!

01:42:21.558 --> 01:42:22.059
l can't see.

01:42:22.184 --> 01:42:24.478
We're still waiting
for the official to make the call.

01:42:24.561 --> 01:42:27.689
REFEREE: Out of the away!
Move away. Let me see it.

01:42:36.448 --> 01:42:39.159
For the 16th time in 21 years,

01:42:39.159 --> 01:42:42.496
your USA Rugby National
High School Champion

01:42:42.621 --> 01:42:44.498

01:42:55.217 --> 01:42:57.302
That's the Rick Penning
l knew was in there!

01:42:57.302 --> 01:42:59.179
Way to go, buddy! Way to go!

01:42:59.304 --> 01:43:01.265

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:32.546
You did it!

01:43:32.754 --> 01:43:34.006
RICK: Hey!

01:43:34.131 --> 01:43:34.965
You did it!

01:43:35.048 --> 01:43:36.717
No. We did it.

01:43:37.342 --> 01:43:39.553

01:43:41.513 --> 01:43:43.932

For you.

01:43:44.641 --> 01:43:45.684

01:43:45.809 --> 01:43:46.935
For the team.

01:43:46.935 --> 01:43:48.187
Feel good, huh?

01:43:49.229 --> 01:43:49.980
Coach...

01:43:56.737 --> 01:43:57.988
Nice game.

01:43:59.031 --> 01:44:00.491
Nice game, Richard.

01:44:14.671 --> 01:44:17.508
GRIGGS: Hey,

01:44:17.591 --> 01:44:18.550
Hey, what is this for?

01:44:18.634 --> 01:44:20.010
Season's over, buddy!

01:44:20.093 --> 01:44:21.261
What are you talking about?

01:44:21.345 --> 01:44:22.513
Oh, ho, ho!

01:44:22.596 --> 01:44:25.516
Hey, Griggs, you gotta pay

01:44:25.641 --> 01:44:26.683
Whoo!

01:44:26.767 --> 01:44:27.518
Oh!

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:29.686

01:44:29.686 --> 01:44:31.271
l promise, l'll only do it for you.

01:44:34.817 --> 01:44:37.110
Best bath l ever had!
