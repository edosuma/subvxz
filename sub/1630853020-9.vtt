00:14.800 --> 00:17.560
<i>Urgent news has reached Eoferwic.</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:20.000
- Aelfwynn was captured on the road.
- By who?

00:20.080 --> 00:21.800
We believe them to be hired men.

00:21.880 --> 00:24.600
We suspect an association
with Lord Aethelhelm.

00:24.680 --> 00:27.240
<i>And my fate</i>
<i>has altered accordingly.</i>

00:27.320 --> 00:28.840
Lord Aethelhelm is fomenting rebellion.

00:28.920 --> 00:31.320
He has made an alliance with Constantine

00:31.400 --> 00:34.040
and has offered him the hand
of Lady Aelfwynn.

00:34.600 --> 00:35.560
Where will we find him?

00:35.640 --> 00:39.000
In a fortress north of here,
name of Bebbanburg.

00:39.080 --> 00:43.360
<i>My birthright, stolen from me</i>
<i>by my cousin Wihtgar.</i>

00:43.440 --> 00:44.640
Your name will be forgotten!

00:48.360 --> 00:50.640
<i>Now I have a chance</i>
<i>to take it back.</i>

00:50.720 --> 00:53.920
I lead the men of Wessex and we push
the Scots back over the border.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.760
Meanwhile, Aethelhelm will be forced
to surrender and Aelfwynn returned.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.080
<i>But King Edward has</i>
<i>a different plan.</i>

00:59.160 --> 01:02.680
In exchange for marrying Aelfwynn
and isolating Lord Aethelhelm,

01:02.760 --> 01:04.320
we will divide Northumbria in two.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.080
The lands around Bebbanburg
fall to the Scots

01:07.160 --> 01:09.160
and Aethelhelm is disposed of.

01:09.239 --> 01:11.240
<i>Yet he could find no support.</i>

01:11.840 --> 01:14.800
I gave your sister my word
that I would keep Aelfwynn safe.

01:14.880 --> 01:18.080
- I stand with Uhtred.
- We stand with Uhtred.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.520
Aethelstan, my boy, what do you say?

01:21.200 --> 01:22.760
I will follow Lord Uhtred.

01:23.520 --> 01:26.000
Not sure things are going your way,
Lord King.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.280
I will brook no more defiance.

01:30.360 --> 01:33.080
No one will leave on penalty of execution!

01:34.160 --> 01:35.960
<i>Destiny is all!</i>

01:46.640 --> 01:50.440
Come on! Quicken the pace!
Sunrise comes swiftly.

01:50.520 --> 01:54.000
Hey, perhaps don't kill me
just before departure.

01:54.080 --> 01:54.960
Move!

01:56.400 --> 01:59.760
- Any word if the king will relent?
- He has shunned all his advisers.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.240
He wouldn't turn swords
on Saxons, surely.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.440
Tell that to the Mercian Ealdormen.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.760
We leave at sunrise.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.280
Do his men still bar the gate?

02:20.360 --> 02:23.640
Yes, and the Mercians
seem set on departure.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.200
I fear neither will back down.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.120
Another person who cannot sleep?

02:42.840 --> 02:46.000
I am not in the king's favor tonight.

02:47.600 --> 02:52.440
I told him he should not turn his back
on Northumbria and he was not pleased.

02:52.520 --> 02:58.880
No man enjoys hearing the truth
from the woman he loves.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.680
Hm.

03:03.560 --> 03:09.680
All the same, when it must be delivered,
God is with us.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.880
My orders are still defied.

03:27.120 --> 03:30.080
Prepare the men of Wessex.
All must gather at the gate.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.840
Yes, Lord King.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.160
Lady.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.040
Edward, do not turn on other Saxons.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.880
Eadgifu, you should be returning
to Winchester.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.200
Now is not the time to become allies.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.400
We are not allies,
merely the women who love you.

03:51.520 --> 03:57.240
I swear, I will say the truth as I see it
and then leave.

03:58.120 --> 04:01.360
Your plan, to forsake Aelfwynn

04:01.440 --> 04:05.880
and make a bargain with the Scots
is not without merit.

04:05.960 --> 04:09.520
It could bring peace, yes,

04:09.600 --> 04:13.400
but at the cost of dividing the Saxons.

04:13.480 --> 04:18.160
Do not risk sundering Mercia from Wessex.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.040
You should be advising Lord Aldhelm.

04:20.120 --> 04:25.000
But I shall not,
for I agree with Lord Aldhelm.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.360
Aethelflaed would follow Uhtred.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.000
I am the king. I do not follow.

04:42.160 --> 04:46.120
You are a king
who is choosing not to lead.

04:46.200 --> 04:52.000
A choice so strange, I ask myself why.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.720
And I only have one conclusion.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.000
Fear.

04:59.600 --> 05:05.600
- I do not fear Aethelhelm, Constantin or--
- No, but you fear Alfred and his legacy.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.840
So I will tell you one thing.

05:17.920 --> 05:23.880
You are strong enough to be the man
to fulfill your father's dream.

05:24.440 --> 05:27.760
You do not have to leave it
to your descendants.

05:27.840 --> 05:32.880
You are worthy to live in the chronicles,

05:32.960 --> 05:36.240
as the one who unified England.

05:36.320 --> 05:40.120
- It is not fear that holds me back.
- I am your mother

05:42.560 --> 05:45.480
and I know when you are afraid.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.680
So I am here to tell you

05:48.760 --> 05:53.040
that I believe you are deserving
of this moment.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.840
You are as good and true

05:56.920 --> 05:59.840
and faithful a man as your father.

06:00.840 --> 06:05.920
And for that, God will favor you.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.520
This is your destiny.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.520
Seize this moment.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.200
Leave your posts!
Rejoin the army!

06:46.920 --> 06:48.080
Wessex have stood down.

06:48.680 --> 06:51.280
Edward's men
no longer defend these walls.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.040
We ride.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.520
- Open the gates.
- Lord. Yes, Lord.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.440
To Bebbanburg then, Lord Uhtred?

07:47.280 --> 07:49.200
Let the king have his moment.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.400
If that is your command.

07:55.480 --> 07:59.040
I will need someone loyal to hold
the border lands in Northumbria.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.920
We confront the Scottish king on the road!

08:09.000 --> 08:11.360
We break his alliance with Lord Aethelhelm

08:11.440 --> 08:14.080
and make a bargain
for Aethelflaed's daughter.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.840
We retain Northumbria
for the Saxon people!

08:31.040 --> 08:34.520
- To Bebbanburg!

09:37.920 --> 09:41.320


09:50.320 --> 09:53.040
Are we expecting to be besieged?

09:53.800 --> 09:57.240
No, we are expecting to decamp
and go south for battle.

09:57.320 --> 10:02.720
We shan't avail ourselves of Northumbrian
hospitality any longer than is necessary.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.640
As soon as Constantin's army arrives

10:06.720 --> 10:10.200
and the marriage is consummated,

10:11.200 --> 10:14.680
we will be on our way with our supplies.

10:14.760 --> 10:18.960
When do they arrive, this army?

10:22.440 --> 10:23.640
Soon.

10:29.520 --> 10:30.920
He does not know.

10:31.720 --> 10:36.200
For all this bluster, he does not know
when these Scotsmen will come.

10:36.280 --> 10:37.600
He just hopes they do.

10:38.920 --> 10:42.320
Does your cousin Uhtred still fight
for the King of the Saxons?

10:42.400 --> 10:43.480
Yes.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.560
Which is why
we will not be leaving these walls

10:46.640 --> 10:50.440
whatever promises we have made,
whatever alliance.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.720
Look who I found
on the road ahead.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.480
Cynlaef. You're late.

11:02.560 --> 11:05.320
Lord, I've had a momentous journey,
so much to tell.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.280
First I found myself lost

11:07.360 --> 11:10.440
- by the broken bridge in--
- No! No, not the time, Cynlaef.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.480
What news do you bring?

11:15.440 --> 11:17.920
Just what was seen
by scouts two nights ago.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.400
Constantin's men preparing a boat
near his port at Dynbaer.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.280
One boat will not transport an army.

11:24.360 --> 11:28.320
It could be an advance guard,
sailing with Constantin himself?

11:28.400 --> 11:30.560
Constantin is a great king.

11:30.640 --> 11:34.040
He would not arrive into a fortress
by the sea gate like a trader.

11:34.120 --> 11:38.000
He could be bringing a gift
for the wedding feast?

11:38.600 --> 11:41.160
No, this endeavor is a show of strength.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.920
He will lead as many men on the road
as he can gather.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.800
I agree. It is unlikely
he will arrive south by sea.

11:47.480 --> 11:50.640
Constantin is strategic. He will know
how changeable the tides are,

11:50.720 --> 11:52.320
the risk of summer storms.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.480
All right, we stay with the plan.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.360
With luck,
his full army will take days to gather.

11:57.440 --> 11:58.440
Onward.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.920
Each man is to report back
three times daily.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.280
When King Constantin's army appears
on the horizon, set fire to that church.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.520
Mother.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.560
This is where you will stay.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.680
Imagine that is a line you do not cross.

12:32.760 --> 12:36.880
Oh, Edward, my life is unimportant.

12:36.960 --> 12:40.960
Your bloodline is safe...
and that is all that matters.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.080
How far is Bebbanburg?

12:49.000 --> 12:52.720
Five miles, but our journey is longer.

12:52.800 --> 12:56.640
At dawn we head west through the woods,
go around the fortress at a distance.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.560
Make our ambush on the roads above it.

12:58.640 --> 13:02.960
I am not one to ask military questions,

13:03.040 --> 13:07.600
but surely word will spread
of a mighty army camping nearby?

13:09.800 --> 13:12.080
There comes a point
at which we cannot hide.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.160
We just have to pray that God is with us.

13:17.440 --> 13:20.880
You will stay here and not foolishly
go out onto the battlefield?

13:22.160 --> 13:24.960
- If the injured need my help I may--
- She will not.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.640
We know our role in this.

13:27.720 --> 13:31.800
Some moments men must face alone,
and this is one.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.560
Alert our lord.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.360
It is the king.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.600
A king would choose a finer ship.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.680
Except for perhaps this one.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.480
My men disembark at the sea gate.

14:13.560 --> 14:16.720
A king arrives at a fortress
through the front.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.480
Here they come.

14:34.920 --> 14:37.720
Stand alert
for the King of the Scots!

14:39.760 --> 14:42.600
Lord King. You are a little in advance
of what we had planned.

14:42.680 --> 14:45.920
I like to catch people off guard.

14:49.160 --> 14:55.080
I was hoping your arrival
would be a little more clandestine.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.600
I did not become a king
to hide in a forest.

14:59.080 --> 15:03.720
Yet we have on our side
the most precious asset

15:03.800 --> 15:08.000
one can gain in war,
the element of surprise.

15:08.080 --> 15:12.200
Squander that
and we risk Edward learning of--

15:12.280 --> 15:16.200
There are spies everywhere.
He will hear soon enough.

15:16.280 --> 15:21.280
Indeed, but his weakness
is his impulsiveness.

15:21.360 --> 15:27.440
- When he learns of our alliance he will--
- I will not sit and wait for an attack.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.520
It is cowardly.

15:32.840 --> 15:36.640
I thought we had agreed
an attack would be launched

15:36.720 --> 15:39.120
once you had cemented ties with Mercia.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.560
And I am a man of my word.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.640
Is that the boy who'd be
King of the Saxons?

15:49.720 --> 15:53.560
Indeed. Aelfweard,
come and bow to King Constantin--

15:53.640 --> 15:56.920
A word of advice from a king
to a future king.

15:58.760 --> 16:01.400
Trust no one who advises you.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.960
- Understood.
- Well, let's eat.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.680
Ask Lady Aelfwynn to join us.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.200
No!

16:23.920 --> 16:27.200
I should prefer to meet her alone,
after we've dined.

16:29.880 --> 16:33.280
Never meet a bride on an empty stomach.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.920
Eh?

17:04.280 --> 17:06.960
Hey, what do you say, Lord?

17:07.760 --> 17:10.560
Lose the deadwood, jump on some horses,

17:10.640 --> 17:14.480
ride up to the gate, just the three of us,
teach your cousin a lesson?

17:15.839 --> 17:19.160
Riding up to the gate
is something I've tried before.

17:23.440 --> 17:27.920
Perhaps better your way than to drag
all of these people to their doom.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.240
Ah, come on!
They want to join you.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.640
This is what they've been waiting for.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.200
They'll tell stories
of this their whole lives.

17:39.280 --> 17:42.600
"Bebbanburg, my part in its conquest."

17:46.160 --> 17:47.160
Hey.

17:48.280 --> 17:53.080
Lord, the news is heavy.
Our plan to ambush is mistimed.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.040
Constantin is already within the fortress.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.640
The spies say he came by sea.

18:08.760 --> 18:12.040
- I am at fault. I counseled this.
- You're not.

18:12.120 --> 18:15.400
Much of this is judgment
and we misjudged it.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.200
How many men were in this boat?

18:24.120 --> 18:26.520
We think only a household guard.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.040
As Uhtred predicted.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.840
Do not assume it is a sign.
We simply make another plan.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.720
It is a sign we should attack.
Before his army arrives--

18:36.800 --> 18:39.600
- No.
- Our targets are all in one place.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.920
Storm the fortress now
and we trap Aethelhelm and Constantin.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.120
Aelfwynn is within. She will be forced to
this marriage and they will threaten her.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.560
Yes, they'll try to use her
in a bargain, but--

18:49.640 --> 18:52.520
But we trust Aethelhelm
to act with reason when he's in a corner?

18:57.320 --> 19:00.000
If we'd got to Constantin,
then it would be a negotiation,

19:00.080 --> 19:01.760
but now we give him nothing to lose.

19:01.840 --> 19:05.040
We have hundreds of men.
Bebbanburg is well defended, yes,

19:05.120 --> 19:06.760
but we will surely outman them.

19:06.840 --> 19:09.960
His own daughter died amidst the fury
of his scheming.

19:10.600 --> 19:14.920
We cannot risk Aethelflaed's child
in the chaos that will engulf Bebbanburg.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.440
There is another way.

19:22.120 --> 19:26.280
I will leave with some of my men.
Wait until you have word from us.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.320
We shall get Aelfwynn out of the fortress,
then you can attack.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.360
- How?
- The sea gate, Lord?

19:32.440 --> 19:35.920
No. There is a route to Bebbanburg which…

19:37.840 --> 19:41.240
it cannot take an army,
not even half a dozen men.

19:42.080 --> 19:47.280
I had dismissed it as too perilous,
but... with a tiny number,

19:48.040 --> 19:49.120
maybe it is possible.

19:49.200 --> 19:52.800
What happens when this tiny number
meets the Household Guard of Bebbanburg?

19:55.760 --> 19:57.600
Pyrlig, are you strong enough to join us?

19:59.560 --> 20:01.160
Are you strong enough to stop me?

20:02.480 --> 20:03.840
Lord, let me be a part of this.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.520
Whatever the danger,
I'm man enough to face it.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.920
Four is a number
that's always served us well in the past.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.720
Stand the men down.
Do not attack until I signal.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.520
Enough evasion. What is the plan?

20:18.120 --> 20:20.440
If it works, we will return with Aelfwynn.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.520
If it does not?

20:24.720 --> 20:27.080
Then this will be the last time
we speak together.

20:32.920 --> 20:36.040
We go north, past Bebbanburg,
on to the next cove.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.040
We will seek the help of someone I know.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.560
What if help is not forthcoming?

20:42.640 --> 20:45.000
Then Finan will have to think
of something.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.160
What?

21:14.720 --> 21:17.320
We have work to do.
No flirting with the nuns.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.200
We'll leave that to you, Uhtred.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.480
If you had written,
we would have brewed some ale.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.040
- You are here!
- You are lucky.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.120
I've been on the island most of the month.
You should have sent word.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.680
I did not know I was coming.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.520
- But the Gods had other plans.
- Have you come for Aalys?

22:12.600 --> 22:14.160
She's in much better spirits,

22:14.240 --> 22:17.080
though she does still dream
of the queen's death.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.520
I come for Bebbanburg.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.120
Is it the time? Have you the men?

22:23.120 --> 22:24.880
Edward has an army south of here.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.760
Huh. Normally we hear of such things.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.800
First, I must get into the fortress

22:29.880 --> 22:32.200
with a small number of men
to secure the Lady Aelfwynn.

22:32.280 --> 22:34.480
Ah. Have you a plan?

22:34.560 --> 22:37.120
One is forming, yes, but I will need help.

22:38.240 --> 22:43.240
- Not yours, I will need the help of--
- No! No, he's too young.

22:44.760 --> 22:47.960
Not his help. No, not his at all.

22:48.040 --> 22:51.200
Is by any piece of luck
the trader Haesten still in these lands?

22:52.840 --> 22:56.640
Uhtred, truly the Gods are with you. Come.

23:05.240 --> 23:08.440
He refuses to leave
because he's making such good coin here.

23:10.200 --> 23:13.080
- We've become quite the marketplace.
- I will find you.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.960
Steal from me and you'll regret it!

23:34.640 --> 23:37.560
- Uhtred!
- I've come to offer silver not to take it.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.240
I'm not in need
and I have already done your bidding.

23:40.320 --> 23:43.160
- Yes, I know, and now I want more.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.760
I am to enter Bebbanburg

23:46.840 --> 23:49.560
and you are to help me
by distracting the Household Guard.

23:50.560 --> 23:55.920
No. No, absolutely not.
Not today, not any day.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.240
It is an unwise choice.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.920
I will retake my lands

24:02.000 --> 24:05.120
and then we will return
to punish you for this refusal.

24:15.840 --> 24:19.280
Threaten me and I shall go to Bebbanburg
tonight and warn them of your attack.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.360
No, you will not.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.840
I'm busy making silver.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.120
Tell me.

24:31.240 --> 24:34.560
Will Valhalla welcome a man
who sells relics to fools?

24:38.400 --> 24:41.840
My ancestors came to these lands
to become rich, Uhtred.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.880
I'm merely living my birthright.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.080
You will not even need
to wield your sword.

24:47.640 --> 24:50.640
All I ask is that you draw the guard
to the shore.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.840
And for that, I will pay you… handsomely.

24:55.600 --> 24:56.960
You do not have the coin.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.760
And yet you know that I will
when I retake Bebbanburg.

25:03.360 --> 25:07.520
And in the contest between Wihtgar and me,
you know who will win.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.440
I'm not known for my loyalty, Uhtred.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.520
It is not wise to put this in my hands.

25:20.720 --> 25:24.520
It is not simple
to lure a guard away from their defenses.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.280
- It will cost you.
- Yes, I know.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.560
Finan is outside.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.040
He will explain the plan.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.520
Pyrlig can borrow our smallest boat.

25:42.600 --> 25:46.640
If they spot him on the water they should
just assume he's part of the pilgrimage.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.120
Make sure you return it.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.720
I will do all I can.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.600
Good luck.

26:03.160 --> 26:06.120
I wonder… perhaps I should join you.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.800
No, please do not.
You have things to protect here.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.560
I'm never certain Haesten can be trusted.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.920
Am I making the right choice?

26:24.360 --> 26:26.480
It cannot be wrong
to protect the Lady Aelfwynn

26:26.560 --> 26:28.600
or to seek a home for your children.

26:28.680 --> 26:31.320
Whether this is the time
that has been chosen for you,

26:32.400 --> 26:35.440
that I cannot say. I hope it is.

26:38.160 --> 26:42.440
But your motive is pure
and so my God will be with you.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.720
Get it done as dawn rises.

26:48.840 --> 26:52.920
And tomorrow will be the first day
of a new world.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.080
- Does everyone understand the plan?
- Yes!

27:07.160 --> 27:10.160
- Yes.
- Hey, do it for him.

27:11.320 --> 27:14.200
He draws the guards down
to the beaches before the tide turns,

27:14.280 --> 27:17.400
giving you a very small
and frankly slightly reckless opportunity

27:17.480 --> 27:20.160
to get in by the guards' room
before they return.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.760
You're forgetting the bit
where you sit on your ass.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.520
Yeah, I... I sit on my ass in the boat.

27:27.600 --> 27:30.120
- Hm.
- Get them out when the signal comes.

27:30.720 --> 27:33.400
Excellent, we're all agreed.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.640
Night approaches
and there is still no word from Uhtred.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.280
Lord King, be patient.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.720
He has never let you down.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.160
Never before
was he fighting for his own lands.

28:14.240 --> 28:18.360
As much as he speaks of Saxon
unity, we know what brings him here.

28:19.160 --> 28:21.080
- I do not think that is fair.
- Perhaps not.

28:21.160 --> 28:24.000
But who has the best interests
of the Saxon people at heart,

28:24.080 --> 28:26.520
- Uhtred or me? I will not--
- Lord…

28:30.320 --> 28:34.600
Spies north of here say the Scots have
left a camp and march in this direction.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.040
- How long until they reach Bebbanburg?
- Unclear.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.240
It will depend on whether they stop
to meet reinforcements

28:45.320 --> 28:48.480
- or if that is the full force.
- And what of Uhtred?

28:51.640 --> 28:54.080
No word, no sighting.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.040
We cannot track him.

29:05.760 --> 29:08.480
What is being discussed
that we should know?

29:08.960 --> 29:10.720
What is being kept from me?

29:11.200 --> 29:12.400
I fear he is going to attack.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.360
Without Lord Uhtred?

29:16.080 --> 29:19.520
He does not seem to care
if my father lives or dies.

29:20.160 --> 29:24.840
Talking to him of Aelfwynn has no effect
and he has no thought for Lord Aelfweard.

29:26.560 --> 29:27.880
Edward is lost.

29:28.640 --> 29:31.760
To be so enraged
by Aethelhelm's treachery,

29:31.840 --> 29:34.200
he would risk his own son in a siege?

29:34.280 --> 29:35.560
Something has gripped him.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.320
It is as if he now believes
he has divine blessing.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.440
My lady.

29:50.680 --> 29:51.560
Lady.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.360
I may have been too emphatic
in my encouragement of the king.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.960
Come, ride with me south.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.160
No! I will not flee the battle.

30:08.240 --> 30:11.600
I will stay where I may be of use
to injured men.

30:11.680 --> 30:14.040
I am not suggesting we flee,

30:14.120 --> 30:17.280
but if you want to avert a slaughter,
then follow.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.400
Do you plan to jump
and swim away?

30:36.920 --> 30:38.360
Perhaps.

30:38.440 --> 30:40.240
Well, do not be fooled by the calm.

30:41.160 --> 30:44.080
The tides here change quickly.
You'd be dashed on the rock.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.920
I do not care. My life is over.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.200
Are you the King of the Scots?

30:51.280 --> 30:52.720
Are you the bride?

30:52.800 --> 30:54.120
So I'm told.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.360
Why are you not married?
You're older than my father.

30:59.840 --> 31:01.320
Which father would that be?

31:10.400 --> 31:13.640
My apologies, it's an unkind joke.

31:15.600 --> 31:18.160
- You already hate me?
- Yes.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.320
Why?

31:20.160 --> 31:22.360
Because I do not wish to marry you!

31:23.480 --> 31:28.600
It is a simple truth.
This is being forced upon me.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.960
I do not wish to marry you either.

31:36.040 --> 31:39.160
- Then free me from this bargain.
- No.

31:39.240 --> 31:41.000
Because I have given my word.

31:41.080 --> 31:42.800
I am being traded.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.720
- That's just the way of things.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.000
You will be rich and well-cared for.

31:51.080 --> 31:54.880
- It is not a terrible curse--
- You have no idea! None!

32:07.320 --> 32:09.600
Who is it that you're fond of?

32:10.680 --> 32:11.520
I'm sorry?

32:11.600 --> 32:14.240
Who has your heart
that fosters so much resentment?

32:14.680 --> 32:16.440
Lord King, I'm pure.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.640
I'm not asking that.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.840
I will not share the content of my heart.

32:24.800 --> 32:25.880
Well, um…

32:29.880 --> 32:32.160
as we… we will be married,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.280
I feel I should offer you my trust.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.400
I am in love.

32:45.720 --> 32:48.080
The woman is married herself…

32:49.720 --> 32:50.920
Yet she is mine.

32:52.960 --> 32:57.560
And I have no wish to betray her
by humping a girl of noble blood.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.320
So…

33:03.680 --> 33:05.120
you will be my wife.

33:06.160 --> 33:10.120
You will live in comfort
in whichever fortress best pleases you.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.880
I shall enjoy the riches of your lands
in Mercia.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.200
I may visit…

33:16.120 --> 33:17.320
but not your chamber.

33:19.560 --> 33:20.920
In short,

33:21.760 --> 33:23.480
the marriage will be barren

33:25.200 --> 33:26.520
and I will never love you.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.280
Lord King…

33:36.360 --> 33:40.360
that is the first time someone
has been honest with me for quite a while.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Thin fellas were they,
your forebears?

34:03.800 --> 34:05.760
How long will we have
to get in and out?

34:06.840 --> 34:09.680
Haesten makes landfall
and all goes to plan,

34:10.400 --> 34:11.680
long enough.

34:18.719 --> 34:19.719
My lord.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.360
The seas have betrayed another ship.

34:48.159 --> 34:50.840
This shore is the land
of Wihtgar of Bebbanburg.

34:51.719 --> 34:52.880
You know this.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.600
We do not seek to trespass,

34:55.679 --> 34:59.040
only to wait for our cargo and salvage it.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.320
Who travels with you, Nun?

35:01.400 --> 35:03.960
A trader bringing relics to Lindisfarne.

35:05.080 --> 35:06.000
Name yourself.

35:08.680 --> 35:11.680
Haesten. Allow us to wait for the tide

35:12.400 --> 35:14.080
and you can have some spoils.

35:18.320 --> 35:19.600
Wait here.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.120
The path has gone.

35:40.200 --> 35:43.280
Is there another way?
Can we go back on ourselves?

35:43.360 --> 35:47.720
There's no time. The tide is turning.
Men will be leaving their posts.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.320
You always wanted to die at Bebbanburg.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.360
Less talk. We climb.

36:16.000 --> 36:21.880
Offer no help. Now is not the time
to be distracted by acts of local charity.

36:22.960 --> 36:26.400
Lord King,
we have extended much hospitality

36:26.480 --> 36:29.560
to you and Lord Aethelhelm.

36:29.640 --> 36:33.040
Allow me to claim the spoils
as recompense.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.040
What's the cargo?

36:38.160 --> 36:39.320
Salt and relics.

36:40.160 --> 36:42.400
When the tide comes in, more may follow.

36:43.280 --> 36:46.240
On my land, I take what washes in.

36:46.320 --> 36:49.080
That is indeed the custom.
You may do as you see fit.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.160
But…

36:59.880 --> 37:02.040
I'd be wary of a ploy.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.560
Danes send men to observe
in the weeks before they attack.

37:08.080 --> 37:10.240
Once we have departed south,

37:11.200 --> 37:13.480
you may be at the mercy of sea raiders.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.040
Then you'll seek to welcome us.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.760
You men, to the shore.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.240
You men, to the courtyard.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.720
You may take your fill as the tide turns.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.960
- Is that the cousin?
- Yes. There's not such a resemblance.

37:46.040 --> 37:47.960
I know a greedy man when I see one.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.560
You should have much in common.
You should be able to keep him talking.

37:53.240 --> 37:56.720
Thank you for allowing us
to gather our treasure.

37:56.800 --> 38:01.200
We will see what else washes up
and leave your land.

38:01.280 --> 38:04.720
Not at all, consider yourself my guests.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.200
Come into the fortress where we have fire.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.840
That is a kindness,
but we have much to do.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.240
I have pilgrims
I need to ferry to the island.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.920
Too many dangers present themselves
to travelers here.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.080
Come into the fortress.

38:19.160 --> 38:23.400
A wedding feast is imminent
and that is a delight we wish to share.

38:29.720 --> 38:34.120
My men will gather your cargo,
though, of course we will take a tribute.

38:49.040 --> 38:51.240
Take your fill
of the riches, men!

38:51.320 --> 38:54.160
Haesten is feeling generous.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.880
Oh, Jesus!

39:07.960 --> 39:10.360
- Can you believe that?

39:16.800 --> 39:18.840
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

39:18.920 --> 39:20.880
Give me your other hand!

39:20.960 --> 39:23.360
Pull! Pull up!

39:31.200 --> 39:33.320
Thank you.

39:36.800 --> 39:39.440
Quickly grab what you can
and return to your posts.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.880
And keep an eye out for more Danish ships!

39:46.880 --> 39:48.840
I'd like somewhere quiet to dress.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.320
Are there ladies' quarters
in the fortress?

39:52.120 --> 39:55.760
You may find your way down to the kitchen.
There are some women there.

40:23.080 --> 40:24.000
This one.

40:26.080 --> 40:28.800
This repair looks weakest.
Try it.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.200
Too fast and too loud!

40:36.120 --> 40:37.440
I cannot hear anyone.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.480
I think Haesten has got them to the shore.

41:01.040 --> 41:02.120
Haesten!

41:03.120 --> 41:07.440
Now that is a face I would not forget.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.760
Are you the poor soul
that was shipwrecked?

41:12.400 --> 41:13.600
- Yes.
- Ah.

41:15.080 --> 41:18.080
I do not recall you, Lord.

41:18.760 --> 41:19.800
No.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.960
No, it seems you do not.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.960
The last time we met,

41:27.040 --> 41:30.840
you imprisoned me in Alfred's tomb.

41:32.520 --> 41:37.440
Siege at Winchester,
it is imprinted on my memory.

41:37.520 --> 41:42.880
And yet you lived and thrived afterwards.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.120
- We were both…

41:46.960 --> 41:48.280
younger men.

41:49.920 --> 41:54.480
My grandson barely slept
for years afterwards.

41:58.600 --> 42:02.160
Well, I have removed the icicles
from my balls

42:02.240 --> 42:04.400
and will be on my way.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.120
Stay a while, Haesten.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.760
We have such memories to share.

43:25.280 --> 43:26.720
Block the hole.

43:30.480 --> 43:31.680
That's enough.

43:57.040 --> 43:58.280
Lord.

44:00.040 --> 44:01.280
Hey, hey.

44:03.560 --> 44:06.320
Here, you are most likely
to be recognized.

44:07.120 --> 44:09.080
What if one of you two gets spotted?

44:09.160 --> 44:10.640
I've a plan for that.

44:10.720 --> 44:13.000
Come on. Let's find Aelfwynn!

44:16.920 --> 44:19.960
- Lord King, wait for Uhtred's signal.
- We have waited and heard nothing.

44:20.040 --> 44:22.280
The time offered to prevail
is slipping away.

44:22.360 --> 44:25.200
But what of Uhtred or Aelfwynn?
They will be killed!

44:26.360 --> 44:28.680
- This is madness.
- Yes.

44:30.640 --> 44:32.000
But we must follow.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.200
Is that the King of the Scots?

45:10.680 --> 45:11.720
Aye.

45:20.920 --> 45:22.840
Lord!

45:24.160 --> 45:25.120
Lord!

45:26.040 --> 45:27.200
Lord!

45:42.920 --> 45:43.760
You men!

45:47.920 --> 45:49.640
Stay in the courtyard.

45:52.600 --> 45:55.400
Why does Constantin place his men here?

45:56.920 --> 46:00.880
We do not discuss
what measures we take.

46:01.520 --> 46:02.920
Aye!

46:04.600 --> 46:06.440
King Constantin?

46:07.760 --> 46:11.320
Your man strays where he is not wanted.

46:12.080 --> 46:13.360
He's no man of mine.

46:25.400 --> 46:27.560
I think you've been fooled, Lord Wihtgar.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.800
How did you get past my men?

46:35.600 --> 46:37.720
Are you <i>shipwrecked Danes</i> also?

46:39.000 --> 46:40.800
Torture them for answers.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.640
Show them what any sea raider would face.

46:58.280 --> 47:00.160
You do God's work, my friends.

47:00.240 --> 47:02.440
You shall make twice this
on my next cargo.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.880
- Lady Aelfwynn?
- Yes?

47:40.760 --> 47:42.080
- Come.
- No!

47:42.160 --> 47:44.080
Come! I'm trying to rescue you!

47:44.160 --> 47:47.400
I have heard that many times before
and it's never been true.

47:47.480 --> 47:51.160
Lady Aelfwynn, I am Lord Haesten.

47:51.240 --> 47:54.280
- I was a friend of your true father!
- Lord Haesten?

47:55.480 --> 47:58.600
Tried to kill my mother! Help!

47:58.680 --> 48:01.640
Help me! Lord King!

48:01.720 --> 48:03.760
This man is trying to seize me.

48:05.680 --> 48:06.840
The girl is mistaken.

48:11.840 --> 48:14.240
If I offended the young lady, I apologize.

48:14.320 --> 48:17.600
Our ways with women
are not the same as yours.

48:22.160 --> 48:25.880
I'm a man of honor.
Perhaps I am misunderstood.

48:27.480 --> 48:28.720
You're a liar.

48:28.800 --> 48:33.920
Your plot is discovered
and your other men captured.

48:37.800 --> 48:41.480
Tell me the truth
of why you came to Bebbanburg

48:42.160 --> 48:44.200
and I shall take only their lives.

48:53.960 --> 48:55.400
I will tell you the truth,

48:57.240 --> 48:59.240
for I serve no one but myself.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.640
I have no allies here

49:06.600 --> 49:08.240
and I'm part of no plan.

49:39.880 --> 49:40.920
Have rid of this.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.200
And fetch the priest!

49:43.280 --> 49:44.600
Get this marriage over!

50:00.080 --> 50:02.000
Perhaps we have gone the wrong way.

50:03.720 --> 50:06.920
The farmer said this was east,
but now I think it is west.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.240
I was told many have joined her,
here amongst the trees.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.520
We know you are here!

50:24.600 --> 50:27.280
We have seen your scouts!

50:29.120 --> 50:30.960
Lady Aelswith.

50:37.160 --> 50:39.800
Do your worst!
You'll get nothing out of us.

50:53.480 --> 50:55.600
It is very foolish of you to come here.

50:56.560 --> 50:58.360
I'm no friend to Christians.

50:58.440 --> 51:00.400
Perhaps, yes.

51:01.280 --> 51:02.480
But…

51:05.160 --> 51:06.960
we need your help.

51:13.040 --> 51:14.040
Halt!

51:16.120 --> 51:19.160
- Let me strike the first blow.

51:19.600 --> 51:20.480
My lord!

51:21.000 --> 51:22.720
Soldiers approach from the south.

51:22.800 --> 51:24.760
- How many?
- Many.

51:28.560 --> 51:29.960
I shall return. Wait.

51:49.200 --> 51:51.720
You, secure the gate! Secure it!

51:56.320 --> 51:57.920
Oh no, no, not yet.

53:03.520 --> 53:05.560
Come no closer!

53:09.080 --> 53:10.240
Speak!

53:10.960 --> 53:12.960
I bring a message from Edward,

53:13.040 --> 53:16.440
King of the Saxons
and king in these lands!

53:17.960 --> 53:22.240
Give us Lord Aethelhelm and Lady Aelfwynn
and we will not attack.

53:22.320 --> 53:26.760
Refuse and we will besiege
and kill you all!

53:27.160 --> 53:28.760
None will survive!
