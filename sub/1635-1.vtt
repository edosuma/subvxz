02:25.826 --> 02:28.496
Your credit is based
on various factors...

02:28.596 --> 02:31.098
and after reviewing your history...

02:31.198 --> 02:33.701
I'm sorry to say you've been denied.

02:33.801 --> 02:36.871
Denied? You... You gotta be shittin' us.

02:36.971 --> 02:38.439
There's gotta be some mistake.

02:38.539 --> 02:42.410
- I have a mortgage that I pay on time.
- Yeah.

02:42.510 --> 02:45.479
I understand, Mr. Vega,
but like I said, there's other factors.

02:45.579 --> 02:47.048
You've opened up another credit line...

02:47.148 --> 02:49.417
which you're completely maxed out on.

02:49.517 --> 02:52.687
Look, Mr., uh... Guillermo Gomez.

02:52.787 --> 02:54.422
My friend Bernie, this...

02:54.522 --> 02:58.059
this is his second liver surgery
in... in six months.

02:58.159 --> 03:01.228
We have 10 prescriptions...

03:01.328 --> 03:03.531
that we have to fill...

03:03.631 --> 03:05.967
every two weeks.

03:06.666 --> 03:08.769
Nobody move!

03:09.563 --> 03:13.441
Listen up!
I want everybody on the floor!

03:13.541 --> 03:16.988
I want your palms flat on the ground!

03:17.812 --> 03:19.780
That means you too, old man!

03:19.880 --> 03:21.716
Goddamn, Frank.

03:21.816 --> 03:23.751
Man, why don't you watch
what you're doing, man?

03:23.851 --> 03:25.953
- I'm sorry, Bernie. It was an accident!
- Hey!

03:26.053 --> 03:28.289
What the hell are you doing?

03:28.389 --> 03:32.593
It cost me $190 to refill
this goddamn prescription...

03:32.693 --> 03:34.829
It cost you $190?

03:34.929 --> 03:38.332
I want you to know that
came out of my disability check!

03:38.432 --> 03:40.501
You gonna hold that over my head now?

03:40.601 --> 03:42.670
I see how it works now.
It's tit for tat, huh?

03:42.770 --> 03:44.939
No, no, it's only tit for tat...

03:45.039 --> 03:47.775
when tat actually
does something for tit.

03:47.875 --> 03:50.578
You're one ungrateful asshole.
You know that?

03:50.678 --> 03:52.480
Screw you!

03:52.580 --> 03:54.025
Wrong move, asshole.

03:56.917 --> 03:58.686
On the ground now!

04:03.124 --> 04:04.694
These nuts!

04:12.500 --> 04:14.502
These nuts!

04:17.103 --> 04:20.374
Using only a walker
and an autographed baseball...

04:20.474 --> 04:23.683
two elderly men managed to stop
a robbery in progress.

04:24.245 --> 04:27.463
Y ahora en el centro de la ciudad
tenemos a dos jubilados...

04:27.563 --> 04:29.696
que han parado el robo de un banco.

04:29.796 --> 04:32.865
Es el caso de los heroes
mÃ¡s improbables.

04:41.762 --> 04:45.032
So I hope the bank
ultimately gave you a loan.

04:45.132 --> 04:47.668
Nope. But they gave us somethin' else.

04:47.768 --> 04:50.571
A goddamn certificate
for a job well done.

04:52.473 --> 04:53.807
Isn't this some shit?

04:54.571 --> 04:58.579
Look at me, man.
I'm prettier than Denzel.

04:58.679 --> 05:00.114
Shoot.

05:06.287 --> 05:09.857
- Who's that?
- Rosaria.

05:09.957 --> 05:11.892
She liking Arizona?

05:11.992 --> 05:14.895
It's Florida. Uh...

05:14.995 --> 05:18.199
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's... She's, uh...

05:18.299 --> 05:21.974
- She's doing all right.
- Sorry, man.

05:23.537 --> 05:26.540
No, no, it's... it's...
You know, it's wonderful, man.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.275
I'm really happy for her.

05:28.375 --> 05:31.679
Rosaria's got a really good job, and...

05:31.779 --> 05:35.116
Julia's going to a much better school.

05:35.216 --> 05:36.889
I'm really happy for 'em.

05:48.429 --> 05:50.798
- Hello?
- You cheatin' on me, Frank?

05:50.898 --> 05:53.868
'Cause I'll be damned if you the toughest
man to get in touch with.

05:53.968 --> 05:57.805
- Carmen, mi amor. What's happening?
- Oh, nothin' much.

05:57.905 --> 06:00.241
Besides the fact
that I'm getting married!

06:01.141 --> 06:02.243
What?

06:02.343 --> 06:05.446
Yes! His name is Geoffrey.
We met six weeks ago.

06:05.546 --> 06:08.182
We fit together like molasses and pie.

06:08.282 --> 06:10.584
I've never connected with
someone like this before, Frank.

06:10.684 --> 06:13.053
Oh, that's great.
I can't wait to meet him.

06:13.153 --> 06:14.722
Well, you're gonna get
your chance this weekend.

06:14.822 --> 06:16.357
- Oh, yeah?
- Yup.

06:16.457 --> 06:19.160
And you and Green Machine
are in my wedding party.

06:19.260 --> 06:21.662
Pack your things, boys.
You comin' down to Baton Rouge.

06:23.097 --> 06:24.632
That's wonderful, Carmen.

06:24.732 --> 06:28.202
And we would love
to be there, but, uh...

06:28.302 --> 06:31.439
You know what, right now Bernie and I are
going through some financial difficulties...

06:31.539 --> 06:33.040
Shut your pie hole, Franklin.

06:33.140 --> 06:35.443
You're not gonna have to pay
for anything, cheap-ass.

06:35.543 --> 06:37.216
Daddy's pickin' up the tab.

06:38.612 --> 06:40.915
That's really generous
of your father, but...

06:41.015 --> 06:44.652
But nothin', Vega. I already e-mailed you
your flight arrangements.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.654
This is a paid vacation for you boys.

06:46.754 --> 06:50.124
So pack up your damn fanny pack
and bring y'all asses down here...

06:50.224 --> 06:52.993
before I fly out there
and drag you by your earlobes.

07:11.745 --> 07:13.614
Oh, man.

07:13.714 --> 07:16.750
Oh, man.

07:16.850 --> 07:19.954
This shit don't agree with me
one bit, man.

07:20.054 --> 07:24.057
I told you, fish on an airplane.
Man, they don't mix.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.093
Oh, shit.

07:28.896 --> 07:31.042
I gotta hit the bathroom.

07:39.473 --> 07:41.453
Son of a bitch.

07:49.984 --> 07:52.123
Oh, yeah.

08:03.564 --> 08:05.966
Hey, little lady.

08:06.066 --> 08:07.739
What you got for dessert?

08:25.085 --> 08:28.355
At this point in my life,
I just don't have time for relationships.

08:28.455 --> 08:31.800
But I do have time
for one-nighters though.

08:32.826 --> 08:34.794
Are you open to one-nighters, Bernie?

08:34.895 --> 08:39.866
One-nighters, two-nighters...
however long it takes.

08:42.202 --> 08:44.004
Excuse me, sir.

08:44.104 --> 08:47.541
But you're going to have
to return to your assigned seat.

08:47.641 --> 08:50.349
This is my assigned seat.

08:51.745 --> 08:54.385
Can I see your boarding pass, please?

08:57.484 --> 08:59.589
Come on, man. Give me a break.

09:03.991 --> 09:06.528
- It's been a pleasure.
- Bye.

09:11.098 --> 09:13.834
You cock-blocking son of a...

09:13.934 --> 09:17.371
Ladies and gentlemen, as we start
our descent into Baton Rouge...

09:17.471 --> 09:21.476
local time is 3:00 PM,
and temperature is a cool 65 degrees.

09:31.519 --> 09:34.521
Nothing like the smell
of the deep South.

09:35.689 --> 09:37.157
Is that us?

09:37.257 --> 09:39.994
I don't think there's
another Vega/Pope in Louisiana.

09:40.094 --> 09:42.701
Gentlemen, my name is Hung.
May I take your bags, please?

09:42.801 --> 09:44.586
I got this, homey. I... I got this.

09:44.686 --> 09:48.079
- Sir, I insist.
- Shit, you can take mine.

09:50.871 --> 09:52.506
After you, sir.

09:52.606 --> 09:55.100
Boy, I could get used to this.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.666
Forecast is cloudy and windy today...

11:25.766 --> 11:28.135
with gusts up to 40 miles per hour...

11:28.235 --> 11:31.705
the temperature dropping
to 59 degrees this afternoon.

11:31.805 --> 11:35.209
Cloudy and continuing wind overnight
with a low of 47.

11:35.309 --> 11:38.078
- Oh, shit.
- Cloudy with a few sunny breaks...

11:38.178 --> 11:39.747
with a high of 53.

11:39.847 --> 11:41.315
With the winds from the northwest...

11:41.415 --> 11:45.419
- Oh, come on.
- It's currently 51 degrees.

11:45.519 --> 11:47.921
With the Washington Monument
in the background...

11:48.021 --> 11:50.491
the president has just arrived
off of his helicopter...

11:50.591 --> 11:53.193
and is coming from Camp David
to spend time...

11:53.293 --> 11:55.662
with the gathering
on the White House lawn.

11:55.762 --> 11:58.232
This is a regular appearance...

11:58.332 --> 11:59.834
Oh, Christ!

12:05.505 --> 12:07.132
Hey!

12:10.077 --> 12:11.678
Gimme the purse.

12:11.778 --> 12:13.413
Fuck you!

12:14.526 --> 12:16.119
Click it or ticket, asshole.

12:17.150 --> 12:18.823
Take care of this shit.

12:24.258 --> 12:26.636
Whoa, they grow them
pretty big here in Baton Rouge, huh?

12:31.198 --> 12:33.838
- All right now, big fella.
- Son of a bitch.

12:34.768 --> 12:37.578
- Pow!
- Aaah!

12:39.473 --> 12:42.545
- Shit.
- Aaah!

12:43.577 --> 12:44.749
Watch it.

12:48.915 --> 12:52.192
- Whoo.
- I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

13:05.232 --> 13:09.236
Ooh, my nose! Oh, you busted my nose!

13:21.348 --> 13:23.016
- Here you go, darling.
- Oh, thank you.

13:23.116 --> 13:25.451
You have a nice day.

13:31.191 --> 13:32.659
Wow.

13:32.759 --> 13:34.962
- Carmen's parents live here?
- Yes, sir.

13:35.062 --> 13:38.134
- Man.
- Reminds me of my vacation home.

13:44.438 --> 13:47.674
Oh, oh! All right, finally!

13:47.774 --> 13:50.618
Now we can get this party started! Oh!

13:55.549 --> 13:57.251
Damn, you look good, girl.

13:57.351 --> 14:00.921
Now, you boys had your chance.
I'm a taken woman now, okay?

14:02.121 --> 14:05.092
Come on in. I wanna introduce you
to my mama and daddy.

14:05.192 --> 14:10.696
Damn, if I knew you had this much money,
I would've proposed to you six months ago.

14:11.164 --> 14:14.101
Mama, Daddy, I want you
to meet Frank and Bernie.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.236
- Oh. Well, welcome, gentlemen.
- Oh.

14:16.336 --> 14:17.804
Thank you. Pleasure to meet you.

14:17.904 --> 14:20.440
- And thank you for bringing us out here.
- Yeah, very generous of you.

14:20.540 --> 14:22.709
- Ah, it's our pleasure.
- Ooh, Carmen.

14:22.809 --> 14:25.245
You didn't tell me
how handsome they were.

14:25.345 --> 14:26.913
Hey, girl, take it easy.

14:27.013 --> 14:29.916
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, my goodness!

14:30.016 --> 14:31.485
Baby, what happened?

14:31.585 --> 14:35.055
Oh, it was just Kyle and his buddies.

14:35.155 --> 14:36.957
Earl, do you see this?

14:37.057 --> 14:38.792
Baby, just a little
innocent roughhousing.

14:38.892 --> 14:40.894
Boys'll be boys. He'll be just fine.

14:40.994 --> 14:45.465
Son, let me introduce you to your sister's
friends from California, Bernie and Frank.

14:45.565 --> 14:47.301
- What's up, guys?
- Sister?

14:47.401 --> 14:49.569
Yeah. He's my brother
from another mother.

14:49.669 --> 14:53.840
Mama had that in vitro thing. We think
the egg and the sperm got a little mixed up.

14:53.940 --> 14:55.409
Felt all the same to me.

14:55.509 --> 14:58.478
Either way,
we love us some little Ronny.

14:58.578 --> 15:01.320
Well, gentlemen, welcome.
Now let me show you to your room.

15:02.382 --> 15:04.484
My, oh, my, Earl.

15:04.584 --> 15:06.907
This house must have
cost you a pretty penny.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.745
- Didn't cost me a dime.
- Say what?

15:09.845 --> 15:13.560
It's a family estate passed down
from generation to generation.

15:13.660 --> 15:16.163
It was given
to my great-great-granddaddy...

15:16.263 --> 15:17.898
post-Civil War...

15:17.998 --> 15:22.269
as part of the agrarian reform
for black farmers.

15:22.369 --> 15:26.807
Little did anybody know that this house was
sitting on mineral reserves, including oil...

15:26.907 --> 15:30.010
which turned our family into
millionaires overnight.

15:30.110 --> 15:33.416
Damn. Karma's a bitch, Robert E. Lee.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.849
Ain't it the truth?

15:35.949 --> 15:38.018
Hope you guys don't mind
sleepin' in the same room.

15:38.118 --> 15:40.821
We got a lot of guests stayin' over,
so the house is kinda full.

15:40.921 --> 15:43.857
Hey, I didn't know
you were in the military.

15:43.957 --> 15:45.926
Oh, yeah.

15:46.026 --> 15:49.963
Spent some time in Nam
many, many years ago.

15:50.063 --> 15:53.734
I don't even know
who that guy is anymore.

15:53.834 --> 15:55.669
There we go.

15:55.769 --> 15:59.873
Everything ought to be here, but, if there's
anything else at all that you need...

15:59.973 --> 16:02.008
please don't hesitate to ask.

16:02.108 --> 16:04.044
What time you sending up the ladies?

16:06.847 --> 16:09.383
- After midnight.
- Why so late?

16:13.487 --> 16:16.757
Uh, fellas,
I just wanna say thank you...

16:16.857 --> 16:19.893
for watchin' over my little girl
while she was in LA.

16:19.993 --> 16:23.196
- It means a lot.
- Carmen's a special girl.

16:23.296 --> 16:25.265
Yeah.

16:26.107 --> 16:29.469
Oh, now. Oh, rehearsal dinner's
in less than an hour.

16:29.569 --> 16:31.138
You guys got to get dressed.

16:31.238 --> 16:34.441
I took the liberty of hangin' up a couple
suits for you in the armoire.

16:34.541 --> 16:36.676
I think we got your right sizes.

16:36.776 --> 16:38.589
One minute.

16:50.690 --> 16:52.715
Let's do this.

17:03.670 --> 17:07.840
Damn. They invited
the entire state of Louisiana.

17:07.941 --> 17:11.111
Maybe they're just popular or something.
Whoo!

17:11.211 --> 17:15.882
Gentlemen, can I tempt your palate to some
of Louisiana's finest mint juleps?

17:15.982 --> 17:17.751
Don't mind if I do.

17:17.851 --> 17:21.054
Wow, I've never seen a drink
with a plant growing out of it.

17:21.154 --> 17:22.888
That's not a plant, sir.

17:22.989 --> 17:26.726
Those are mint sprigs. Very refreshing.

17:26.826 --> 17:29.830
- Enjoy.
- Mmm.

17:29.930 --> 17:32.399
- Mint sprigs.
- Here's to.

17:35.302 --> 17:37.804
Straight outta the pages of GQ.

17:37.904 --> 17:40.807
Damn! You boys look like
fine Southern gentlemen.

17:40.907 --> 17:42.409
Hey, baby.

17:42.509 --> 17:44.311
There you go.

17:44.411 --> 17:47.080
Girl, I can't leave you for two minutes
without someone hitting on you.

17:47.180 --> 17:49.883
Oh, baby, I want you
to meet Frank and Bernie.

17:49.983 --> 17:52.119
Boys, this is my Geoffrey.

17:52.219 --> 17:54.888
Gentlemen, it's an honor
to finally meet you.

17:54.988 --> 17:57.290
- You must be Frank.
- Pleasure.

17:57.390 --> 18:01.261
- And you must be Green Machine.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

18:01.361 --> 18:03.296
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

18:03.396 --> 18:04.931
You're getting yourself
a wonderful woman.

18:05.031 --> 18:07.501
Oh, I know. I'm blessed.

18:07.601 --> 18:10.637
Must've done something good
in a past life to deserve her.

18:10.737 --> 18:12.182
Isn't he cute?

18:13.940 --> 18:15.476
Geoffrey!

18:16.877 --> 18:18.745
- Looks like I'm being summoned.
- Mmm.

18:18.845 --> 18:20.347
Excuse me, gentlemen.

18:21.915 --> 18:23.360
Sweetheart.

18:26.653 --> 18:28.121
Nice guy.

18:28.221 --> 18:30.490
No one has ever made me feel
the way he does...

18:30.590 --> 18:32.058
and I've never been happier.

18:32.158 --> 18:34.995
What happened to him?

18:35.095 --> 18:37.097
If you don't mind me asking.

18:37.197 --> 18:39.733
He was in Afghanistan
on the front lines.

18:39.833 --> 18:41.701
He took an IED for a buddy.

18:41.801 --> 18:43.537
I'm sorry, Carmen.

18:43.637 --> 18:45.372
Nothing to be sorry about.

18:45.472 --> 18:48.341
That man lives his life like
he's standin' seven feet tall.

19:03.523 --> 19:08.094
I wanna thank you all for comin', and now
I'd like to say a few words.

19:08.194 --> 19:10.564
You know, it's tough for a father...

19:10.664 --> 19:12.766
to watch his daughter grow and...

19:12.866 --> 19:16.002
then to give her away to a stranger.

19:16.102 --> 19:18.238
Wait a minute.

19:18.338 --> 19:21.553
That's the speech
from her first wedding.

19:24.945 --> 19:26.413
Here it is.

19:26.513 --> 19:30.884
It's tough for a father
to watch his daughter grow...

19:30.984 --> 19:33.420
give her away to some stranger...

19:33.520 --> 19:36.256
get her back
and then give her away again.

19:39.993 --> 19:43.630
But it makes it easier when you have
a future son-in-law like Geoffrey here.

19:48.034 --> 19:51.447
Your mother and I wish you both
the very best.

19:52.806 --> 19:54.342
Hear! Hear!

20:05.605 --> 20:08.088
- Okay, okay. A toast. A toast.
- Yeah.

20:08.188 --> 20:12.826
Carmen and Geoffrey, we wanna wish you all
the best in the world forever.

20:12.926 --> 20:17.097
May you always have happiness, love...

20:17.197 --> 20:20.644
and you know what else... you know that.

20:22.982 --> 20:24.010
Yeah.

20:56.703 --> 20:58.270
Ah, yeah.

22:09.576 --> 22:11.044
Let her go!

22:11.144 --> 22:13.513
- Shut up, buddy!
- Bernie!

22:16.675 --> 22:18.928
Bernie!

22:23.857 --> 22:26.428
Bernie, for Christ's sakes, help me!

22:32.999 --> 22:35.309
Hey, Frank!

22:36.169 --> 22:38.271
Frank!

22:38.371 --> 22:42.708
Goddamn, man! How could you be sleeping
at a time like this?

22:46.312 --> 22:50.583
- Where's Carmen?
- That's what I've been trying to tell you.

22:50.683 --> 22:52.218
Somebody took her.

22:54.888 --> 22:56.423
I don't know.

22:56.523 --> 22:59.492
Like I said, we were sleeping and they
just barged in and took her.

22:59.592 --> 23:01.327
That's all I remember.

23:01.427 --> 23:03.763
Jesus Christ, shouldn't you all be out
looking for these bastards?

23:03.863 --> 23:07.133
Just calm down. You need to understand this
is all part of the process.

23:07.233 --> 23:11.037
I don't think you understand.
My fianceÃ©'s been kidnapped!

23:11.137 --> 23:15.241
Damn it, we told you. We never heard
a thing until Frank started yellin'.

23:15.341 --> 23:17.841
By the time we got out there,
they were gone.

23:17.941 --> 23:19.381
- I want my child.
- I know, baby.

23:20.813 --> 23:23.982
Can you give us any type of description?

23:24.082 --> 23:27.220
Well, I couldn't make out
much in the dark, but, uh...

23:27.320 --> 23:30.190
they had ski masks and, uh...
there was a lot of 'em.

23:30.290 --> 23:34.828
- How many would you say?
- Eight, 10, maybe more.

23:34.928 --> 23:37.030
Come on, man. How could you not know?

23:37.130 --> 23:40.300
Maybe because it was pitch black,
and they all kept comin' at me...

23:40.400 --> 23:42.101
and I didn't have any help, Bernie!

23:42.201 --> 23:44.437
So now you gonna blame me for it, huh?

23:44.537 --> 23:46.806
Okay, gentlemen.

23:46.906 --> 23:50.276
Let's not bicker.
It's not gonna help us get her back.

23:50.376 --> 23:53.721
You are gonna find her?
It's a pretty small town.

23:55.014 --> 24:00.653
239,139 to be exact, Mr. Vega.

24:00.753 --> 24:03.656
Just a tad bit bigger than Mayberry.

24:03.756 --> 24:06.059
Okay, Chief, I think
we got everything here.

24:06.159 --> 24:11.130
Follow up with, uh... Wigram on
them there surveillance cameras.

24:11.230 --> 24:12.732
I'm on it.

24:14.300 --> 24:16.102
Chief Broussard...

24:16.202 --> 24:19.839
I don't want the next time I see my daughter
to be on the side of a milk carton.

24:19.939 --> 24:24.144
You hear me? Now, I don't care what it takes
or how much money I got to spend.

24:24.244 --> 24:27.384
You got to get her back,
and you got to get my daughter back now.

24:29.182 --> 24:31.084
Telephone call for you, Mr. Morgan.

24:31.184 --> 24:33.721
- Hung, now is not the time.
- He says he has Carmen.

24:34.487 --> 24:36.556
- Is he on hold?
- Yes.

24:36.656 --> 24:39.296
We got this thing tracked.
Take the call.

24:41.327 --> 24:42.595
Hello.

24:42.695 --> 24:44.664
Let's cut to the chase, Mr. Morgan.

24:44.764 --> 24:46.432
Five million for your daughter.

24:46.532 --> 24:48.001
You'll have 32 hours...

24:48.101 --> 24:51.571
upon which I'll contact you to reveal
a designated meeting location.

24:51.671 --> 24:54.774
You mess up any of my instructions
and she's dead.

24:59.412 --> 25:01.514
I don't know. It could be anyone.

25:01.614 --> 25:05.385
You know, a black man with money
is not a recipe for popularity.

25:05.485 --> 25:08.321
You know, whoever did this
really planned it out.

25:08.421 --> 25:09.889
This was organized.

25:09.989 --> 25:13.246
Anyone have it out for you
or been following you around?

25:13.346 --> 25:16.801
Of course. I get people all the time
trying to get me to invest in businesses...

25:16.901 --> 25:19.469
or sell this house.

25:19.966 --> 25:21.868
Man, I can't believe this is happenin'.

25:21.968 --> 25:25.437
This is my baby girl. She's supposed
to be gettin' married on Sunday.

25:34.380 --> 25:36.950
Oh. We need your help.

25:37.050 --> 25:40.953
This is a small town. We don't get too many
of these types of crimes around here.

25:41.053 --> 25:44.390
But I know you boys have experience
with this back in LA.

25:44.490 --> 25:47.427
- Uh, not exactly...
- We need your help.

25:47.527 --> 25:50.597
We need you to find Carmen
and bring her back home.

25:50.697 --> 25:54.434
Mrs. Morgan, you have the... the...
The police are on this...

25:54.534 --> 25:56.936
The police aren't going to do anything.

25:57.036 --> 26:00.473
They got their heads so far up their asses
they can't see squat.

26:00.573 --> 26:02.675
We need you two...

26:02.775 --> 26:05.881
if there's any hope in me
gettin' my Carmen back.

26:06.946 --> 26:08.514
Guys!

26:08.614 --> 26:11.356
Guys, look what I found
by the side gate.

26:15.021 --> 26:19.625
- Buford? Who names their kid Buford?
- Let me see.

26:19.725 --> 26:23.596
Ronald found this on
the north side of the estate.

26:23.696 --> 26:26.833
Now, how'd my people overlook this?

26:26.933 --> 26:29.869
Sloppiness really gives me
the mal au ventre.

26:29.969 --> 26:32.305
We'll check into it.
Might be one of my boys.

26:32.405 --> 26:34.908
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Whoa...

26:36.776 --> 26:39.812
You must have some idea
who's behind this.

26:39.912 --> 26:43.116
Let me tell you something.

26:43.216 --> 26:45.017
This ain't Los Angeles.

26:45.117 --> 26:47.120
This here is Baton Rouge.

26:47.220 --> 26:51.791
We don't go in for that canaille vigilante
crap y'all be pullin' down there.

26:51.891 --> 26:56.129
And if you even think about
gettin' involved in this case...

26:56.229 --> 26:59.532
I hear you put even
one nose hair in this case...

26:59.632 --> 27:03.469
I'm gonna lock y'all up
for the rest of y'all golden years.

27:03.569 --> 27:06.846
You gentlemen enjoy
the rest of y'all afternoon.

27:11.978 --> 27:13.880
Let's go get those son of a bitches.

28:19.212 --> 28:23.950
I'm just gonna make this clear
right now. No running.

28:24.050 --> 28:27.487
- What?
- Now, I will do all the ass-kicking you want.

28:27.587 --> 28:31.224
But I'm not chasin' after shit.

28:31.324 --> 28:33.392
Such a bitch.

28:48.741 --> 28:52.077
We're not in LA anymore.

29:07.927 --> 29:09.762
Whoo!

29:09.862 --> 29:13.566
Goddamn kidney stone's
kickin' my ass again.

29:13.666 --> 29:15.635
You're fallin' apart
piece by piece, chief.

29:15.735 --> 29:19.005
Hey, good news, I still got my penis.

29:19.105 --> 29:22.211
Hello there, little lady.

29:24.210 --> 29:26.212
- Come on. Let's go in.
- Yeah.

29:51.304 --> 29:54.173
Last time I saw this many
white people in one place...

29:54.273 --> 29:58.244
they set fire to a cross
on my dichondra.

29:58.344 --> 30:03.216
Bernie, it's good for you to get out of your
comfort zone, meet some people.

30:03.316 --> 30:05.227
Ah, not these type of people.

30:06.819 --> 30:10.456
But then, Mama always said,
"Don't be so closed-minded."

30:18.330 --> 30:20.366
Hello, ladies and gentlemen!

30:20.466 --> 30:22.735
We just wanna ask you...

30:22.835 --> 30:24.837
one question.

30:25.938 --> 30:27.773
Go ahead, Frank.

30:27.873 --> 30:31.244
Oh, uh...
Yeah, we're looking for a Mr. Buford.

30:31.344 --> 30:33.045
Does anybody here know his whereabouts?

30:33.145 --> 30:34.647
I do.

30:36.249 --> 30:39.836
Hey... Hey, fellas. How ya doin'?

30:39.936 --> 30:41.754
Looks like you're healing up
real nicely.

30:41.854 --> 30:45.558
Hell yeah. Much better than y'all did
before we fucked y'all up.

30:54.133 --> 30:55.942
Take a seat!

30:59.538 --> 31:01.374
Die, asshole!

31:07.813 --> 31:09.315
Now...

31:10.683 --> 31:14.120
you Q-tip-looking motherfuckers!

31:14.220 --> 31:17.289
I'm gon' ask you one more time!

31:17.389 --> 31:19.494
Where's Buford?

31:25.064 --> 31:27.133
I said no running.

31:30.703 --> 31:33.172
Hey. Hey.

31:33.272 --> 31:35.241
Mr. Buford.

31:35.341 --> 31:37.109
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

31:37.209 --> 31:40.346
How'd you get in here
without your VIP card?

31:40.446 --> 31:43.115
- Now, where's Carmen?
- Fuck off!

31:43.215 --> 31:45.017
Oh. Oh, okay. Fuck off.

31:50.055 --> 31:51.490
Get the hell back.

31:57.196 --> 31:59.765
I don't know, man! I swear to God!

31:59.865 --> 32:02.368
I ain't got access
to the inner circle, man.

32:02.468 --> 32:04.470
Landry does. Landry knows!

32:04.570 --> 32:07.473
- Where can I find this Mr. Landry?
- Downtown, man.

32:07.573 --> 32:09.175
Up the road.
It's on Seventh and Convention.

32:09.275 --> 32:12.445
A big white loft, top floor.
You can't fuckin' miss it.

32:12.545 --> 32:15.648
I really wanna thank you
for your cooperation. I mean it.

32:41.440 --> 32:43.442
Ronny. What's up, buddy?

32:44.477 --> 32:47.546
Hey. I was just actually runnin' late...

32:47.646 --> 32:50.016
No, hey, I understand.

32:50.116 --> 32:51.584
You're a busy man.

32:51.684 --> 32:54.563
Got places to go.
He's got deals to make. I get it.

32:55.621 --> 32:57.456
I was gonna ask you a favor as a friend.

32:57.556 --> 33:00.192
My car's in the shop.
I'm gonna borrow yours for a couple weeks.

33:00.292 --> 33:03.205
- Cool with that?
- My car?

33:04.463 --> 33:08.100
This week,
we have family in... in town...

33:08.200 --> 33:11.771
and... and I'm playing chauffeur.

33:11.871 --> 33:15.207
Oh, yeah. No, hey. I totally get it.

33:15.307 --> 33:16.809
I get that.

33:18.444 --> 33:21.847
Listen, either you give me this car...

33:21.947 --> 33:23.916
or I'll beat the shit out of you.

33:24.016 --> 33:25.825
It's your choice.

33:26.385 --> 33:28.354
Hey.

33:28.454 --> 33:30.832
- You boys got somewhere you gotta be?
- Yeah.

33:31.557 --> 33:33.127
We're all set.

33:33.726 --> 33:35.728
Keep it moving.

34:26.478 --> 34:29.681
Unless you gonna let my ass go,
I don't want shit from you.

34:29.782 --> 34:32.818
Is that any way to treat your host?

34:32.918 --> 34:36.088
I done got you them nice white shoes
to keep your feet warm.

34:36.188 --> 34:38.623
Look, you Duck
Dynasty-looking motherfucker.

34:38.724 --> 34:42.069
If you think for one minute you gonna get
away with this shit, you dead wrong.

34:43.329 --> 34:44.967
All right then.

34:46.264 --> 34:48.335
I'll keep it warm for you.

35:08.254 --> 35:09.889
Those goddamn old bastards.

35:09.989 --> 35:11.969
They just came in and roughed up Buford.

35:13.125 --> 35:16.368
Pete.
You mind taking that someplace else?

35:18.030 --> 35:19.532
Yeah, sure.

35:29.074 --> 35:30.776
What the fuck?

35:30.876 --> 35:34.780
How in the hell Buford
let two old sons of bitches rough him up?

35:34.880 --> 35:39.284
- I don't know. He's a goddamn mama's boy.
- I told y'all to follow them.

36:09.214 --> 36:12.852
Why do all bad guys got nice places?

36:12.952 --> 36:15.254
Same reason
they all got beautiful women.

36:15.354 --> 36:18.631
Boy, what you talking about?
They don't all have beautiful women.

36:24.095 --> 36:26.799
Hey, little lady.
We're here to see Landry.

36:26.899 --> 36:29.702
- Is he around?
- Landry doesn't live here anymore.

36:29.802 --> 36:31.424
So get lost.

36:32.404 --> 36:35.241
Can you tell us where we might find him?

36:35.341 --> 36:39.144
- Get your foot out of my door.
- Come on, little girl.

36:39.244 --> 36:41.246
No sense in you acting all...

36:46.785 --> 36:48.254
I think she loosened a crown.

36:48.354 --> 36:52.658
Wait. Now hold it. There's no need for
violence. We just wanna talk.

36:52.758 --> 36:55.227
Now, look here, lady. We're gentlemen.

36:55.327 --> 36:57.170
We don't hit women... Ow!

37:02.768 --> 37:06.572
Now, all we wanna know
is where Landry is.

37:06.672 --> 37:08.407
Fuck you!

37:08.507 --> 37:11.710
- All right.
- Let go of me! I can't breathe!

37:11.810 --> 37:14.313
Not till you tell me where Landry is.

37:15.781 --> 37:17.283
Buckhead...

37:20.786 --> 37:22.888
- Where is he?
- He works at Buckheads.

37:22.988 --> 37:24.456
It's...

37:24.556 --> 37:28.327
It's a... barbecue place
just outside of town.

37:28.427 --> 37:31.530
He'll be there tomorrow morning.
Now get the fuck outta here!

37:31.630 --> 37:34.767
So soon?
I thought we had a beautiful connection.

37:34.867 --> 37:36.836
Aside from your foot in my kidney.

37:36.936 --> 37:39.505
Goddamn. You see any internal bleeding?

37:39.605 --> 37:41.107
Damn.

38:04.830 --> 38:06.432
What's up, buddy?

38:06.532 --> 38:08.300
So happy I ran into you here, man.

38:08.400 --> 38:11.837
- Listen, Kyle, I...
- Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

38:16.208 --> 38:19.478
Listen, I'm gonna need, like,
20 bucks or so for some snacks.

38:19.819 --> 38:22.681
I, uh... I don't have that.

38:22.781 --> 38:27.319
- Oh, I think you do, money ball.
- No, not really. I would.

38:27.419 --> 38:31.731
Hand it over...
before I beat you senseless.

38:34.927 --> 38:37.567
Yeah. All right.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.569
Why don't you get a job?

38:43.669 --> 38:45.371
Who the hell are you?

38:45.471 --> 38:46.939
Friends of Ronald.

38:47.039 --> 38:49.675
If I'm not mistaken,
they're hiring here.

38:49.775 --> 38:51.610
You've gotta be kidding me.

38:51.710 --> 38:54.380
You got your grandpa in here
to protect you?

38:54.480 --> 38:57.249
Don't you two got some early
bird buffet to hit up?

38:57.349 --> 39:00.719
Yeah, if I were you two,
I'd back the hell up right now before I...

39:00.819 --> 39:02.955
- Kyle!
- What?

39:03.055 --> 39:04.590
It's the Bad Asses.

39:04.690 --> 39:06.992
What?

39:07.092 --> 39:09.862
Bad Asses. From the bank.

39:09.962 --> 39:11.964
Oh, snap, it is.

39:12.064 --> 39:14.666
Wow! Whoa, we are huge fans.

39:14.766 --> 39:16.235
- Kyle.
- Dad.

39:16.335 --> 39:18.070
- What's goin' on here?
- Nothin'.

39:18.170 --> 39:21.740
Just havin' a conversation with Ronny and
the Bad Asses. You know who these guys are?

39:21.840 --> 39:23.709
Yeah, we've met. Gentlemen.

39:23.809 --> 39:27.580
Mom wants us home for dinner before 6:00,
so we gotta get a move on.

39:27.680 --> 39:31.423
Okay. We're all cool.

39:33.285 --> 39:34.889
Good evening.

39:43.262 --> 39:45.964
I appreciate what y'all did...

39:46.064 --> 39:48.734
but I can't have you interfering
in my son's business.

39:48.834 --> 39:53.405
I'm trying to steer him away
from violence and threats...

39:53.505 --> 39:55.507
and instead use diplomacy...

39:55.607 --> 39:59.144
as a tool to confront conflict, hmm?

39:59.244 --> 40:02.348
- How's that diplomacy workin' out for you?
- Just fine.

40:02.448 --> 40:04.383
No offense, gentlemen...

40:04.483 --> 40:08.053
but I am not a fan of your tactics.

40:08.153 --> 40:10.289
I think there's better ways
to solve problems.

40:10.389 --> 40:12.091
Explain to me, Earl.

40:12.191 --> 40:17.129
How do you go from bein' in the Marines
to bein' a pacifist?

40:17.229 --> 40:19.832
After you've seen what I've seen...

40:19.932 --> 40:22.935
you never wanna be involved
with violence again.

40:25.404 --> 40:28.007
- Geoffrey.
- Hey. How you doing?

40:28.107 --> 40:29.375
Hey, son.

40:29.475 --> 40:32.177
I can't believe this is even happening.

40:32.277 --> 40:34.713
Now, we got it covered, Geoff.

40:34.813 --> 40:37.983
I can't stop thinking
about what they're doing to her right now.

40:38.083 --> 40:40.018
Calm down, son. Take it easy.

40:40.118 --> 40:42.521
Why don't you try to get some sleep?

40:42.621 --> 40:45.124
You think I can sleep
at a time like this?

40:59.838 --> 41:01.749
Hey, what was that?

41:12.551 --> 41:14.052
Hey, you'll have to excuse me.

41:14.152 --> 41:17.725
I think I just knocked over
one of Mr. Morgan's planters on the way in.

41:19.024 --> 41:22.094
For some reason,
he's got it out for you two.

41:22.194 --> 41:25.497
You boys need to just
stay away from this case.

41:25.597 --> 41:30.502
I have a problem stayin' away from somethin'
I know nobody's doin' anything about.

41:30.602 --> 41:34.006
Who said nobody's doin' anything
about this case? Huh?

41:34.106 --> 41:38.210
I can assure you we are doin' everything we
can, and we'll get Carmen back.

41:38.310 --> 41:40.079
That's bullshit, man.

41:40.179 --> 41:41.780
Excuse me?

41:41.880 --> 41:45.919
People above you are makin' a mockery
of your justice system.

41:47.152 --> 41:49.054
Look, Mr. Vega...

41:49.154 --> 41:51.356
I am all for what you two are about.

41:51.456 --> 41:54.593
But my advice
is just to leave this alone...

41:54.693 --> 41:56.900
and let us do our job, okay?

42:13.345 --> 42:16.792
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure. Come on in.

42:18.183 --> 42:19.685
Sit down.

42:22.455 --> 42:25.033
I just wanted to thank you
for helping me out.

42:26.358 --> 42:27.826
It was nothin'.

42:27.926 --> 42:31.066
They just needed
a little straightening out.

42:35.133 --> 42:37.536
I want you to have this.

42:37.636 --> 42:39.938
This was my father's.

42:40.038 --> 42:42.917
He carried it around with him
during the war.

42:43.976 --> 42:46.718
It's pure titanium. This saved his life.

42:48.146 --> 42:51.286
Look, you can even see the bullet mark.

42:53.585 --> 42:56.288
Ronald, it's beautiful,
but I can't keep this.

42:56.388 --> 42:58.223
Please.

42:58.323 --> 43:00.325
I want you to have it.

43:03.395 --> 43:05.375
Thank you.

43:07.199 --> 43:10.836
Can I... ask you a question, Frank?

43:10.936 --> 43:12.973
Yeah.

43:14.006 --> 43:16.842
Did you always have it in you to...

43:16.942 --> 43:18.649
be a hero?

43:19.845 --> 43:21.546
I don't know.

43:21.646 --> 43:24.216
I'm just... wondering...

43:24.316 --> 43:26.887
if it's something you just have...

43:28.153 --> 43:30.326
or you don't.

43:31.123 --> 43:33.000
You've got it in you.

43:34.192 --> 43:37.062
You just gotta be true to yourself...

43:37.162 --> 43:39.998
and keep doing the right thing.

43:40.098 --> 43:42.401
All right, now.

43:42.501 --> 43:46.171
Cut out that Little House on the Prairie
shit and get the hell to sleep.

43:46.271 --> 43:47.841
Shit.

45:04.683 --> 45:08.820
I can't tell you how many times she accidentally
rubbed her elbow against my nuts.

45:08.920 --> 45:13.192
That's what they call
good ol' Southern hospitality.

45:26.671 --> 45:28.582
Okay, now.

45:34.946 --> 45:38.826
I promise, if I get out of this
I'm going to Jenny Craig.

45:57.435 --> 45:59.604
Password. Password.

45:59.704 --> 46:01.479
"Long beard."

46:04.776 --> 46:06.756
"Moonshine."

46:18.290 --> 46:21.693
You need a little bit more black pepper in
there, and then you got something.

46:21.793 --> 46:24.364
- Okay.
- What do we got here?

46:27.566 --> 46:30.869
That's not bad. Needs a touch more paprika
in that rub though.

46:30.969 --> 46:32.471
Thank you.

46:37.242 --> 46:40.178
What the hell'd
you put in this, coullion?

46:40.278 --> 46:43.215
Who the hell you calling
"coullion," coullion?

46:43.315 --> 46:45.261
- Who the hell is you?
- Where's Carmen?

46:47.786 --> 46:49.354
Hold on!

46:49.454 --> 46:52.230
You didn't answer my friend's question.
Where's Carmen?

46:57.195 --> 46:58.830
"I married my cousin."

46:58.930 --> 47:00.999
Damn!

47:06.638 --> 47:09.608
Hello, 1988.

47:16.047 --> 47:18.618
All right, cochons, who gonna die first?

47:25.490 --> 47:27.299
Come on. Come on, come on.

47:30.829 --> 47:32.638
- Where is she?
- You go to hell!

47:46.077 --> 47:48.023
Jawn, you in there?

47:52.751 --> 47:54.953
Okay. Now, where is she?

47:55.053 --> 47:56.655
You go to hell, salope!

47:56.755 --> 47:58.290
All right!

48:04.654 --> 48:07.666
Okay, now where's Carmen?

48:07.766 --> 48:09.668
- Fuck you!
- Okay.

48:09.768 --> 48:12.804
No, no, no, no! No! No!

48:12.904 --> 48:16.141
Okay! I'll tell you!
I'll tell you! I'll tell you!

48:16.241 --> 48:19.778
She's over at the compound
in Greenwell Springs!

48:19.878 --> 48:23.682
You're gonna give me
the address and your car keys.

48:24.382 --> 48:26.629
Just take 'em!

48:28.953 --> 48:30.796
I'll check her room!

48:44.803 --> 48:48.140
Do you mind,
you Peeping Tom motherfucker?

48:48.240 --> 48:50.686
- This here door wouldn't...
- Just back that ass up outta here.

49:03.088 --> 49:05.090
Get me Harris.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.302
Please enter your destination.

49:17.402 --> 49:21.880
I guess fat guys with big beards
also have nice trucks.

49:23.141 --> 49:25.210
I don't know how to get back.

49:25.310 --> 49:26.678
What?

49:26.778 --> 49:28.647
I pressed in the wrong address...

49:28.747 --> 49:31.249
and I don't know how to
go back and delete it.

49:31.349 --> 49:35.052
- Try pressing "delete."
- Where's "delete"?

49:35.652 --> 49:37.189
On the keyboard.

49:41.393 --> 49:44.496
There, no need. We've got some help.

49:55.073 --> 49:57.509
Whew. Hey.

49:57.609 --> 50:00.712
Thank goodness, fellas.
We had no idea where we were going.

50:00.812 --> 50:03.114
Freeze and put your hands
over your head!

50:03.214 --> 50:07.253
- Hold on. What's going on...
- Shut your mouth and put your hands in the air!

50:18.129 --> 50:19.665
Well, well, well.

50:20.899 --> 50:22.801
Fancy meeting you fellas out here...

50:22.901 --> 50:25.370
in the middle of nowhere.

50:25.470 --> 50:27.939
I gotta tell you...

50:28.039 --> 50:31.309
it ain't the safest place
for out-of-towners like you.

50:31.409 --> 50:33.578
You lowlife son of a bitch.

50:34.078 --> 50:35.962
Try.

50:56.768 --> 50:58.236
What happened?

50:58.336 --> 51:01.442
Turns out they weren't willing
to help with directions.

51:05.176 --> 51:09.080
Well, rise and shine, Mr. Vega.

51:09.180 --> 51:10.782
Where you taking us?

51:10.882 --> 51:12.517
It's a surprise.

51:12.617 --> 51:14.919
But I can tell you this much...

51:15.019 --> 51:18.689
The view is something special.

51:20.258 --> 51:24.996
I been goin' on and on, tryin' to get you
boys not to get involved...

51:25.096 --> 51:27.165
but you wouldn't listen.

51:27.265 --> 51:30.869
Now... it's time to pay the price.

51:30.969 --> 51:32.971
Look, homey...

51:33.071 --> 51:35.874
we're gonna give you
one last chance to redeem yourself.

51:35.974 --> 51:37.275
Yeah.

51:37.375 --> 51:40.144
You let us go, and we won't kill you
when this is all over.

51:43.148 --> 51:45.884
What you been smokin', brah?

51:45.984 --> 51:47.886
The jig is up.

51:47.986 --> 51:49.520
Y'all lose.

51:49.620 --> 51:52.490
You're never gonna get away with it.

51:52.590 --> 51:54.626
I'm the police chief.

51:54.726 --> 51:56.728
I'm the shit around here.

52:03.234 --> 52:06.338
Here we go, gentlemen.

52:06.438 --> 52:11.009
I'm about to find y'all
a nice little piece of private swampland...

52:11.109 --> 52:13.478
to drop y'all into.

52:13.578 --> 52:17.081
I wish you two a bon voyage.

52:19.250 --> 52:21.196
C'est la vie.

52:45.810 --> 52:47.712
- Hello?
- Reynolds Oil Refinery.

52:47.812 --> 52:50.648
East gate. 6:00.

52:50.748 --> 52:53.251
Your wife brings the money. Alone.

52:53.351 --> 52:56.921
We see anyone else there,
your daughter dies.

52:57.021 --> 53:00.291
Now hang on one second. Hello?

53:00.391 --> 53:01.597
Hello!

53:11.536 --> 53:13.237
Uh, excuse me.

53:13.337 --> 53:15.206
I'm lookin' for Chief Broussard.

53:15.306 --> 53:17.342
He said he'd be back in 20 minutes.

53:17.442 --> 53:19.012
I'll wait.

53:42.734 --> 53:45.437
Any of you boys wanna play canasta?

53:45.537 --> 53:47.847
We... We could use a third.

53:50.241 --> 53:53.578
I don't know how the hell
we gon' get outta this.

53:53.678 --> 53:56.581
It don't look like they're
passing out any parachutes.

53:57.526 --> 53:59.422
Yeah...

54:02.762 --> 54:04.461
Son of a bitch!

54:06.283 --> 54:07.525
Bernie, you all right?

54:07.625 --> 54:10.495
- This is real bad!
- He needs some help, man!

54:12.864 --> 54:15.300
He had a liver transplant
and his body's rejecting it!

54:15.400 --> 54:18.603
If we don't hold him down,
he'll choke on his tongue!

54:20.018 --> 54:21.873
Son of a...

54:21.973 --> 54:24.371
Come on now! We need some help!

55:00.445 --> 55:02.721
Night-night, homey.

55:09.220 --> 55:12.724
Well, that's great.
You know how to fly one of these things?

55:12.824 --> 55:15.566
Come on. I've seen Top Gun
a hundred times.

55:23.801 --> 55:26.070
We need to figure out
how we gonna land this baby.

55:26.170 --> 55:28.807
See if there's an instruction manual
in the glove compartment.

55:28.907 --> 55:33.117
Glove compartment? Mexican, this ain't
your daddy's Eldorado! Shit!

55:36.280 --> 55:39.117
You know what?
This looks like somethin'.

55:39.217 --> 55:42.987
Hey, hey! Jesus Christ, Vega! You just can't
start blindly pulling on shit!

55:47.843 --> 55:49.840
Goddamn!

55:49.940 --> 55:53.011
My boy knows how to fly a plane!

55:55.666 --> 55:59.103
Okay, now. I think we need
to slow it up a bit. Okay?

55:59.203 --> 56:02.514
That's the part I'm not too sure about.

56:03.875 --> 56:07.545
- That shit ain't workin', man!
- I'm trying everything!

56:07.645 --> 56:09.852
Try harder! That shit ain't working!

56:15.077 --> 56:16.880
Slow down!

56:54.892 --> 56:56.735
Oh, crap!

57:06.370 --> 57:07.974
Oh, shit!

57:18.883 --> 57:22.387
No wonder your ass is taking the bus.
You can't drive anything worth shit!

58:09.566 --> 58:11.972
Thank you for flying Mexican Airlines.

58:49.407 --> 58:51.409
There's no reception.

58:52.844 --> 58:55.179
- Where the hell you going?
- I'm going to get help.

58:55.279 --> 58:56.748
Out in the middle of nowhere?

58:56.848 --> 58:59.717
We're probably 50 miles away
from anything, man. I ain't walking.

58:59.817 --> 59:01.986
- Well, then stay here.
- You kidding?

59:02.086 --> 59:06.223
What about all these damn gators and
werewolves and all that shit?

59:06.323 --> 59:07.959
All right, hold on.

59:10.028 --> 59:12.096
Bernie, look, I ain't
got time for this shit.

59:12.196 --> 59:14.198
Now you're either coming or staying.

59:14.298 --> 59:16.200
But you can't have it both ways.

59:18.969 --> 59:20.880
What the hell is that?

01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:14.926
Damn.

01:00:15.026 --> 01:00:17.495
Don't matter if you're in LA
or Baton Rouge.

01:00:17.595 --> 01:00:20.498
Everybody has goddamn rush hour traffic.

01:00:20.598 --> 01:00:22.669
What the hell are we supposed to do now?

01:00:24.669 --> 01:00:26.444
Use the shoulder, homey.

01:00:59.103 --> 01:01:02.440
Security's tighter
than the Ugandan Consulate.

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.442
How the hell are we gon' get in?

01:01:04.542 --> 01:01:08.179
Why you always gotta be
sweating everything? We got this.

01:01:08.279 --> 01:01:09.917
Yeah.

01:01:12.516 --> 01:01:15.019
What the hell you boys
think you're doin'?

01:01:15.119 --> 01:01:16.854
Uh, lost a contact lens.

01:01:16.954 --> 01:01:18.389
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:18.489 --> 01:01:20.291
Let's see.

01:01:20.391 --> 01:01:22.259
Ah! Here it is.

01:01:23.279 --> 01:01:24.737
Found it.

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:28.132
- Oh, good.
- You got that?

01:01:29.383 --> 01:01:30.468
Got it.

01:01:30.568 --> 01:01:33.538
- Yeah.
- I guess we'll be going.

01:01:33.638 --> 01:01:35.640
Freeze, assholes.

01:01:41.545 --> 01:01:44.715
I know you.
You're those two old fuckers.

01:01:44.815 --> 01:01:46.884
- Yeah.
- That's us.

01:01:46.984 --> 01:01:48.452
Oh, shit!

01:01:48.552 --> 01:01:51.055
Man, you old geezers are bad-ass!

01:01:51.155 --> 01:01:53.224
- Thanks, man.
- Appreciate that.

01:01:53.324 --> 01:01:55.927
- Yeah.
- We all real big fans.

01:01:56.027 --> 01:01:57.395
All right.

01:01:57.495 --> 01:01:59.564
Unfortunately,
I'm still gonna have to kill y'all.

01:01:59.664 --> 01:02:01.465
- Excuse me?
- What?

01:02:01.565 --> 01:02:03.234
You boys been trespassing.

01:02:03.334 --> 01:02:05.136
Trespassing's grounds for shooting.

01:02:05.236 --> 01:02:09.473
Now look, there's no reason
to shoot two old guys.

01:02:09.573 --> 01:02:12.179
Sorry, brahs. Just doing my job.

01:02:17.314 --> 01:02:18.884
Lights out, ho.

01:02:21.152 --> 01:02:22.953
What about diplomacy, Earl?

01:02:23.053 --> 01:02:25.158
Screw diplomacy.

01:02:26.524 --> 01:02:28.758
Now let's go get my daughter.

01:02:49.113 --> 01:02:50.683
Any ideas?

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:53.888
That one.

01:03:46.337 --> 01:03:49.341
How the hell we supposed
to know where she is?

01:03:52.076 --> 01:03:54.613
Something tells me we've found her.

01:03:55.779 --> 01:03:58.282
Any suggestions?

01:03:58.382 --> 01:04:00.017
Not one.

01:04:03.521 --> 01:04:05.222
Get down there!

01:04:05.322 --> 01:04:06.892
Let's go.

01:04:09.393 --> 01:04:11.600
Damn, Earl.

01:04:20.671 --> 01:04:22.406
Well, hell, it's about damn time.

01:04:22.506 --> 01:04:24.742
You know how he likes
to make an entrance.

01:04:24.842 --> 01:04:26.477
Daddy! What are you doin' here?

01:04:26.577 --> 01:04:28.979
What do you think? You okay?

01:04:29.079 --> 01:04:30.981
Okay, we gotta get outta here. Now!

01:04:31.081 --> 01:04:32.754
You're gonna need this.

01:04:35.986 --> 01:04:38.990
Let's go get those motherfuckers.

01:05:41.652 --> 01:05:42.756
Shit!

01:06:11.715 --> 01:06:14.813
Take that, bitches!

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:17.252
Very impressive.

01:06:17.995 --> 01:06:19.525
Drop your weapons.

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:23.696
Drop your weapons!

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:29.600
Geoffrey, what the hell are you doin'?

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:32.002
I know this is all quite confusing.

01:06:32.102 --> 01:06:34.671
But the truth of the matter is...

01:06:34.771 --> 01:06:37.174
the plan got derailed a bit
by your boys here.

01:06:37.274 --> 01:06:39.176
Geoffrey,
if this is your way of eloping...

01:06:39.276 --> 01:06:41.912
you should've came clean
before my daddy started signing checks.

01:06:42.012 --> 01:06:44.014
Can't get a deposit back now.

01:06:44.114 --> 01:06:47.218
I always loved your sense of humor.

01:06:47.318 --> 01:06:48.986
Hey!

01:06:49.086 --> 01:06:51.055
Put the gun down.

01:06:51.155 --> 01:06:53.457
I'm not going to hurt her...

01:06:53.557 --> 01:06:55.993
unless somebody tries to play hero.

01:06:56.093 --> 01:06:58.095
Now, move into the other room.

01:06:59.796 --> 01:07:01.104
Now!

01:07:06.136 --> 01:07:09.310
You too, lovey. Off you go.

01:07:10.307 --> 01:07:12.082
Who are you?

01:07:17.481 --> 01:07:20.250
You had no intentions
of marrying her, did you?

01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:22.686
It's not that she's not
a wonderful young lady.

01:07:22.786 --> 01:07:25.596
And if the circumstances
were different, who knows?

01:07:26.624 --> 01:07:28.992
But this is a business opportunity...

01:07:29.092 --> 01:07:31.662
that my cousin and I couldn't pass up.

01:07:31.762 --> 01:07:34.898
Your cousin? As in the police chief?

01:07:34.998 --> 01:07:37.134
Yes.

01:07:37.234 --> 01:07:39.837
You would be correct, Mr. Vega.

01:07:39.937 --> 01:07:41.505
Pretty sharp you are.

01:07:41.605 --> 01:07:44.741
Just leave my daughter with us.
I'll see that you get your money.

01:07:44.841 --> 01:07:47.744
Oh, I wish I could
take you up on it, Earl...

01:07:47.844 --> 01:07:50.480
but for some reason I don't believe you.

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:54.084
In addition, we've got big plans for Carmen
to help us get out of the country.

01:07:54.184 --> 01:07:56.824
You son of a bitch!

01:07:57.755 --> 01:07:59.200
Calm down, Earl.

01:08:00.424 --> 01:08:01.698
We're gonna get you.

01:08:02.993 --> 01:08:05.200
I highly doubt that, Mr. Vega.

01:08:07.631 --> 01:08:10.767
You see, this is
the end of the line for you lads.

01:08:12.936 --> 01:08:16.145
With that, I must wish you
a heartfelt good-bye.

01:08:17.241 --> 01:08:19.209
Lucas!

01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:22.688
Come on, lovey. Off we go, lovey.

01:08:27.317 --> 01:08:29.053
Oh, shit.

01:09:32.515 --> 01:09:37.187
Looks like we gon' have some barbecue
tonight. I hope they like dark meat.

01:09:37.287 --> 01:09:39.723
It's too tight. They're too tight.

01:09:39.823 --> 01:09:43.794
Come on, my man. You gotta have somethin'
in that fanny pack of yours.

01:09:43.894 --> 01:09:45.295
My hands are tied.

01:09:45.395 --> 01:09:49.232
We're screwed, fellas.
No way out of this one.

01:09:53.303 --> 01:09:58.075
"Hey, come on.
Let's go to Louisiana." Yeah!

01:09:58.175 --> 01:10:00.878
"A little vacation,
get away from it all."

01:10:00.978 --> 01:10:04.715
- Oh, now it's all my fault?
- You bet your ass it's your fault.

01:10:04.815 --> 01:10:08.118
Can't you ever
take responsibility for anything?

01:10:08.218 --> 01:10:11.655
Yeah. If you hadn't pushed us
out here, I wouldn't have...

01:10:11.755 --> 01:10:13.157
Enough!

01:10:13.257 --> 01:10:16.568
Can't a man even die in peace?

01:10:25.269 --> 01:10:26.771
I'm sorry, man.

01:10:28.338 --> 01:10:30.207
No.

01:10:30.307 --> 01:10:32.309
It was a good ride.

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:35.889
- It was, huh?
- Yeah.

01:10:53.564 --> 01:10:55.465
Hey, do you guys need a lift?

01:10:55.565 --> 01:10:58.341
It's Ronny! What the hell?

01:11:01.371 --> 01:11:03.841
Get in the truck! Get in the truck!

01:11:07.277 --> 01:11:08.779
Come on, go!

01:11:31.835 --> 01:11:34.872
You saved our lives! My white baby boy!

01:11:34.972 --> 01:11:36.373
You saved our lives!

01:11:36.473 --> 01:11:38.175
How did you know we were here?

01:11:38.275 --> 01:11:40.844
I didn't. I hid in the back of the car.

01:11:40.944 --> 01:11:45.249
And that gives us exactly 22 minutes to make
it to that Reynolds Oil Refinery...

01:11:45.349 --> 01:11:46.984
before Mom makes the exchange.

01:11:47.084 --> 01:11:48.719
- Twenty-two minutes?
- You got it.

01:11:48.819 --> 01:11:52.198
- That place is 45 minutes away.
- Then you'd better step on it.

01:11:57.427 --> 01:11:59.797
They're gonna have
a whole damn army with them.

01:11:59.897 --> 01:12:01.532
We're gon' need some help, man.

01:12:01.632 --> 01:12:03.441
Ronald, give me your cell phone.

01:12:34.364 --> 01:12:35.900
Geoffrey?

01:12:36.933 --> 01:12:39.236
Hello, Lois.

01:12:39.336 --> 01:12:42.806
I know this isn't what you expected...

01:12:42.906 --> 01:12:45.609
but if you'd just hand over the money...

01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:47.347
I'll get you Carmen.

01:12:50.581 --> 01:12:54.028
You scum-sucking pig.

01:12:55.052 --> 01:12:56.588
Hand over the money.

01:12:57.287 --> 01:12:59.389
You go screw yourself.

01:13:04.995 --> 01:13:07.564
I admire your courage...

01:13:07.664 --> 01:13:10.501
but it's not worth it.

01:13:10.601 --> 01:13:14.237
Not giving you nothing
till you hand her over.

01:13:14.337 --> 01:13:16.146
Suit yourself.

01:13:35.892 --> 01:13:37.838
Let's kick some geriatric ass!

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:44.668
Oh! Earl!

01:13:44.768 --> 01:13:47.170
Come on. Get out of the car.

01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:50.274
Earl! Earl, are you all right?

01:13:50.374 --> 01:13:52.609
Yeah. You done real good, baby.

01:13:54.544 --> 01:13:57.447
Whoo! Look at this!
Baby boy to the rescue!

01:13:57.547 --> 01:13:59.816
I'm so happy to see you!

01:14:01.751 --> 01:14:04.755
Damn cops are late even in Louisiana.

01:14:12.729 --> 01:14:14.174
Hands in the air!

01:14:22.239 --> 01:14:24.741
Jesus Christ there, Geoffrey.

01:14:26.843 --> 01:14:30.313
How the hell you let this thing get
this far out of hand?

01:14:31.515 --> 01:14:34.584
Son of a bitch.

01:14:34.684 --> 01:14:37.187
- I believe this belongs to me.
- Hey!

01:14:43.426 --> 01:14:45.201
Mr. Vega.

01:14:46.396 --> 01:14:48.706
You done gone and messed everything up.

01:14:49.433 --> 01:14:51.702
And now...

01:14:51.802 --> 01:14:54.305
everybody's gonna have to die for it.

01:14:57.307 --> 01:14:58.842
Starting with you.

01:15:00.944 --> 01:15:02.646
You bad-ass.

01:15:02.746 --> 01:15:04.214
Freeze!

01:15:05.782 --> 01:15:07.386
Drop it, Julius!

01:15:09.152 --> 01:15:11.688
Oh, Pete. Now, what you doin' here?

01:15:11.788 --> 01:15:14.990
It's over. Drop the gun!

01:15:15.092 --> 01:15:20.872
Boy, you done got yourself
into somethin' way above y'all heads.

01:15:22.265 --> 01:15:24.108
Now if I was you...

01:15:25.168 --> 01:15:27.737
I'd go on, go back home...

01:15:27.837 --> 01:15:29.806
take your little boys with you.

01:15:29.906 --> 01:15:32.477
Put the gun down, Julius!

01:15:34.578 --> 01:15:36.780
Put your hands above your head! Now!

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.183
That's not gon' happen, boy!

01:15:40.283 --> 01:15:42.785
Best step the hell off...

01:15:43.487 --> 01:15:45.255
'cause I'm about to...

01:15:47.757 --> 01:15:49.393
Get the fuck back!

01:15:49.493 --> 01:15:51.862
- Get the fuck back!
- Hell no!

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:54.157
Goddamn!

01:16:01.571 --> 01:16:03.551
You shot my fanny pack!

01:16:31.802 --> 01:16:34.071
- Frank! You okay?
- Yeah.

01:16:34.171 --> 01:16:38.041
Goddamn! That fanny pack
saved your life! What?

01:16:39.398 --> 01:16:41.436
It was Ronald's watch.

01:16:41.536 --> 01:16:44.988
It take a lickin' and keep on tickin'!

01:16:46.883 --> 01:16:50.787
Damn, Green Machine!
Is that you or a lead pipe in your pocket?

01:16:54.924 --> 01:16:56.660
Stay down, bitch.

01:17:12.075 --> 01:17:14.211
Well, I guess that's about it.

01:17:14.311 --> 01:17:17.814
Oh, come on, boys. You sure you don't wanna
chill out here a few more days?

01:17:17.914 --> 01:17:20.083
We'll make it worth your while.

01:17:20.183 --> 01:17:24.521
We'd love to, but Bernie's got a doctor's
appointment first thing tomorrow morning.

01:17:24.621 --> 01:17:27.958
All right, then.
Bring it on in for the sweet thang.

01:17:30.593 --> 01:17:34.531
You have no idea how grateful
I am to the both of you. Thank you so much.

01:17:34.631 --> 01:17:36.266
- You're gonna be all right.
- Hell, yeah.

01:17:36.366 --> 01:17:38.403
Who needs another man
when I have you two?

01:17:40.337 --> 01:17:43.309
You know, you boys
are welcome here anytime.

01:17:48.278 --> 01:17:51.381
You got about five minutes before you hit
the road. Can I borrow you two a moment?

01:17:51.481 --> 01:17:53.290
Yeah. All right.

01:17:56.153 --> 01:18:01.424
I'm deeply indebted to both of you.
You brought my child back.

01:18:01.524 --> 01:18:04.995
Words can never express
how much I appreciate that.

01:18:05.095 --> 01:18:08.098
But you gave me somethin' else.

01:18:08.198 --> 01:18:11.635
For the first time in 30 years, guys...
30 years...

01:18:11.735 --> 01:18:13.537
I feel alive again.

01:18:13.637 --> 01:18:17.340
And because of that,
I've found my true purpose.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:20.544
I wanna bring justice
back to those places...

01:18:20.644 --> 01:18:23.380
that have been completely
drained of it...

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:26.082
and I wanna do it with the two of you.

01:18:26.182 --> 01:18:30.995
Think of it as three old guys
kickin' ass.

01:18:32.389 --> 01:18:35.058
- Sounds like a great idea, Earl, but...
- Yeah, yeah.

01:18:35.158 --> 01:18:36.860
You know, Bernie and I...

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.728
have other responsibilities.

01:18:38.828 --> 01:18:41.731
Oh, Frank, I'm aware of that.
I know you got your community center.

01:18:41.831 --> 01:18:45.068
And of course Bernie's got his liquor store.
I'm not asking you to give that up.

01:18:45.168 --> 01:18:49.072
Look, I wanna make it
as easy as possible for both you guys.

01:18:49.172 --> 01:18:51.474
I will fund the entire operation...

01:18:51.574 --> 01:18:53.977
and I will put
the both of you on salary.

01:18:54.077 --> 01:18:59.149
That way you won't have to worry about paying
your bills, especially those medical bills.

01:18:59.249 --> 01:19:01.151
You serious, man?

01:19:01.251 --> 01:19:03.458
As a liver transplant.

01:19:05.388 --> 01:19:07.390
So what do you say, guys?

01:19:09.292 --> 01:19:12.296
You ready to clean up this country?

01:19:29.579 --> 01:19:31.281
Oh, Bernie.

01:19:31.381 --> 01:19:34.584
There is more to you than meets the eye.

01:19:34.684 --> 01:19:38.121
I must say, I'm intrigued.

01:19:38.221 --> 01:19:39.823
As am I, Kate.

01:19:39.923 --> 01:19:42.130
As am I.

01:19:45.995 --> 01:19:49.943
Excuse me, sir, but you're going to have to
return to your assigned seat.
