resist going after Alex.

Baking soda?

09:27.858 --> 09:29.193
Baking soda!

09:29.235 --> 09:31.153
- Wake up, dreamer.
- What?

09:31.195 --> 09:33.114
I thought I was here
as Guest Alan.

09:33.155 --> 09:34.865
But it's obvious
you only see me as Chef Alan.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.242
If you're looking for my

09:36.284 --> 09:38.244
professional opinion,
it's gonna cost you.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.453
Oh, really? Okay.

09:39.495 --> 09:40.538
How much, how much to tell me

09:40.580 --> 09:41.622
what to do with these potatoes?

09:41.664 --> 09:42.915
- Eight dollars.
- Eight bucks?

09:42.957 --> 09:44.500
Are you crazy?
I'm a working man.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.377
Besides, I can already tell

09:46.419 --> 09:48.129
from the way your eyes lit up

09:48.170 --> 09:51.882
that the correct
answer is water.

happened to be Armenian.

I have a female pediatrician

biweekly tick checks

10:35.051 --> 10:38.721

I was quite thorough.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.473

- I was born naked.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.750
Uh, I believe it's apricot.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.128
No, thanks.

I'm just gonna head home.

I-I, I don't know
what to say, Tessa.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.389
I'm just so disappointed
in Alex.

11:21.430 --> 11:22.932
And embarrassed,
quite frankly.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.767
I can't imagine
what's going through her head.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.769
It's okay.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.271
Maybe it wasn't meant to be.

11:29.313 --> 11:32.525
Anyway, dinner was great.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.112
Oh!

what your father's gonna say

Alex didn't show up.

Well, he's not gonna
hear it from me 'cause

I'm in no mood
to hear it from him.

- Bye.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.584
- Careful.

My mom didn't show up.

I had no idea where she was
or what country she was in

it didn't even matter.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.234
You must be Tessa.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.031
Wow.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.033
She's beautiful.

Thank you.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.921
She's in New York
with Helen, Alex.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.506
- They were both expecting you.
- No.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.217
- That can't be right.
- 'Yes, it's right.'

12:40.259 --> 12:42.219
No, I got a fax
from my mom that said

12:42.261 --> 12:44.972
Tessa was here in Chatswin,
and then my flight got delayed

12:45.014 --> 12:46.432

straight here.

do know each other.

13:02.531 --> 13:05.075

I met and judged you years ago.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.997
Uh! How can I be so stupid?

13:10.039 --> 13:12.666
Everything I touch
turns to garbage!

13:12.708 --> 13:13.959
- Sweetie, it can't be that bad.
- Not really.

- 'That sucks.'
- 'Oh.'

13:17.797 --> 13:20.174
George, can I talk to you
for a minute?

13:23.427 --> 13:25.763
George, I can't believe
you're being so cold.

13:25.805 --> 13:29.308
That poor woman is obviously
sorry about her mistake.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.601
And look at her.
She's beside herself.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.853
Dallas, trust me,
you can't get sucked in.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.688
This, this is what Alex does.

13:34.730 --> 13:37.024
She's irresponsible.
She hurts other people.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.277
And, and then, and then
she acts like she's the victim.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.029
In the end,
you're so busy comforting her

13:42.071 --> 13:44.156

is the one that screwed up.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.617
She's the one that caused it.
Do you unders..

Well, don't you feel
just a little bit sorry for her?

It had to be hard
for her to show up here.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.124
Hard for her?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.876

That's who I feel sorry for,
my kid.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.173
Alex is not my kid.

She was supposed to be
the mother of my kid.

I gotta call Tessa.

Oh.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.514
I'm sorry
about the wishbone, dad.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.111
or would you care for
some more dark meat?

14:22.152 --> 14:24.488
Okay, Lisa,
let's have out with it

14:24.530 --> 14:26.156
so these boys
can eat my pie in peace.

I saw Malik naked.

Well, it wasn't a small deal.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.375
Oh! Okay. Okay, okay.

I went in to put some
fresh towels in the bathroom

'and he was getting
out of the shower.'

14:39.920 --> 14:41.714
It was an accidental sighting,
and Malik knows that.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.507
Oh, come on.
Malik was born naked.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.550

it might not be a big deal

15:11.994 --> 15:13.621
In some ways, I was relieved.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.789
Maybe the whole change thing
is overrated.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.626
I was still the girl
who hadn't met her mother

15:18.667 --> 15:20.044
and there was comfort in that.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.629
She's a real hard worker.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.756
In fact, for as long as
I've been dealing

15:23.797 --> 15:25.507
none of my employees
have ever pushed

15:25.549 --> 15:28.552
the amount of crystal rock
she has.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.554
Tessa's very much like a man.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.057
She dresses like a man,
but she's smaller than a man.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.601

trapped in a small boy's body.

Why did she salute?

16:15.557 --> 16:17.226

of the military at any point?

16:19.311 --> 16:22.648

She probably felt awkward.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.942
Well, it was awkward.

You know,
I should probably just go.

- I'll call you a cab.
- Wait, no, George, no.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.490
This is a make-or-break moment
for Tessa.

Alex needs to get up there
and make this right.

it may never happen.

There's nothing to discuss.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.640
Every time I look at you
all I see is

16:56.682 --> 16:58.142
my mother seeing you naked.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.435
That doesn't make any sense.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.519
You've gone further
with my mother

17:00.561 --> 17:01.895
than I have gone with you.

17:01.937 --> 17:04.189
Well, what do you want me to do?

17:04.231 --> 17:06.316
- I want you to leave me alone.
- Really?

17:06.358 --> 17:08.360
You're-you're gonna blame me for
something that wasn't my fault?

17:08.402 --> 17:11.363
- I-it was an accident!
- Maybe we were the accident.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.865
You know what, maybe we were.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.825
You're really immature,
you know that?

You want me to hate your mom?
Sorry, I don't. Grow up.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.597
But they've always been
my favorite band.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.015
Ever since I saw them
perform at the..

19:02.057 --> 19:04.434
[snoring]

19:08.355 --> 19:10.691
[laughs]
How messed up would that be

19:10.732 --> 19:12.693
if I actually
fell asleep right then?

19:12.734 --> 19:15.195
[both laughing]

19:17.447 --> 19:20.159
Is it tough for you,
fitting in here?

19:20.868 --> 19:22.744
Yeah.

19:22.786 --> 19:23.829

19:44.308 --> 19:46.476
Sometimes the big moments
you picture in your mind

19:46.518 --> 19:48.520
don't turn out
the way you think they will.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.564
But if you unexpectedly
get a second chance

19:50.606 --> 19:53.400
to make things right
you should probably take it.

Hey, ev-everything
Kajagoogoo up there?

20:06.496 --> 20:07.706
What?

20:07.748 --> 20:10.375
Everything was fine..

20:10.417 --> 20:11.919
...if that's what you're asking.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.086
Yeah.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.880
(Tessa)
Yeah.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.173
She kept pretending
to fall asleep

20:16.215 --> 20:18.258
and then
she actually fell asleep.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.344
We got to talk a bunch, though.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.640
She seems pretty cool.

20:24.681 --> 20:26.391
Is it okay if she stays over?

20:26.433 --> 20:28.685
'I just don't want to wake
her up to tell her to leave.'

20:28.727 --> 20:30.270
She'll get going
in the morning.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.314
Yeah, fine. That's fine.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.150
Thanks..

20:35.192 --> 20:38.862
...dad, for, like,
letting all this happen.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.990
You don't have to thank me.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.076
I'm not gonna
be an obstacle in this.

20:45.535 --> 20:46.912
You'll see.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.541
All I ever want
is for you to be happy.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.545
I'm happy.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.923
Good. Good.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.720
Really happy.

21:03.762 --> 21:07.057
Holy crap! Did you cook this?
This is stupid good!

21:07.099 --> 21:09.851
I cooked exactly none of that.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.145
Chef Alan
practically made everything.

21:12.187 --> 21:14.022
And charged me
through the nose for it.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.524
In that case, I'm gonna
have to make a plate.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.859
Yeah, me, too.
I think I'll join you.

21:17.901 --> 21:21.947
I was so stressed out tonight,
I barely had a bite.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.199
Let me try this.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.578
- Stupid good.
- Mm-hmm.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.580
- You want some turkey?
- Yeah.
