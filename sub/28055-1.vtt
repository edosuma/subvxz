00:08.676 --> 00:10.042
      [Tina] You're happy.

00:11.379 --> 00:12.378
          [Karen] Yes.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.247
         [Tina] Really?

00:16.517 --> 00:17.516
          [Karen] Yes.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.322
     [sirens in background]

00:28.295 --> 00:30.662
        [xylophone music]

00:35.503 --> 00:37.436
             [song]

01:50.611 --> 01:54.513
Do you know how much the flowers
      at the wedding cost?

01:56.250 --> 01:59.818
 How come everyone always knows
   how much the flowers cost?

01:59.820 --> 02:02.254
How come you're so goddamn cute?

02:02.256 --> 02:04.823
          [both giggle]

02:18.873 --> 02:21.406
     [Tina] If we have time
       before they come...

02:21.408 --> 02:24.209
      [Wayne] We have time,
        we'll make time.

02:24.211 --> 02:27.412
[Karen] How can you not remember
  her? She was at our wedding.

02:27.414 --> 02:30.749
  -[Don] You never talk to her.
   -She's my only close friend
        from art school.

02:30.751 --> 02:34.186
     I mentioned to her that
  we were coming into the city,
      I can't not see her.

02:34.188 --> 02:35.454
  And this is where she lives?

02:37.691 --> 02:39.224
      This can't be right.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.529
     They better have a TV.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.230
    I hate what I'm wearing.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.300
        Hang on a second.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.405
       [Karen] Is this it?

02:53.407 --> 02:54.773
          I don't know,
       there's no numbers.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.409
        How can there not
         be any numbers?

02:58.445 --> 03:00.445
          [she giggles]

03:00.447 --> 03:02.314
            -[splash]
         -[she screams]

03:02.316 --> 03:05.484
        -Son of a bitch!
-No, no, no, no, no, just drive.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.419
           Just drive.

03:09.657 --> 03:10.923
            Damn it!

03:13.928 --> 03:15.360
          What's that?

03:20.701 --> 03:23.835
        -[both giggling]
       -Nice neighborhood.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.872
        [music continues]

03:45.859 --> 03:47.259
             [Wayne]
   Tina wants me to get going.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.230
  No. We're having people over.

03:52.533 --> 03:56.602
     No, no, no, it's fine.

03:56.604 --> 03:57.970
        We love you too.

03:57.972 --> 03:59.471
         Okay, bye, bye.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.341
      Get dressed, please.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.742
            Relax.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.777
   OK, it so doesn't relax me
       when you say that.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.383
         How do I look?

04:13.721 --> 04:15.020
   How are you trying to look?

04:15.022 --> 04:18.690
        Um, accomplished.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.826
 And excessively tasteful, sexy?

04:21.695 --> 04:24.429
          I mean, yeah.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.430
              Yeah!

04:27.635 --> 04:32.371
      Now it's time to play
 hide the [unintelligible] lie.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.673
          Depressants.

04:34.675 --> 04:37.042
Oh my god, where's the squirrel?

04:37.044 --> 04:39.778
              Yes.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.914
             -Oh...
          -This was our
favorite wedding present. Okay?

04:42.916 --> 04:45.951
  Whatever you say, just please
      get it away from me.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.052
            Please.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.420
            [buzzer]

04:49.923 --> 04:51.590
         We're on four.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.892
    You're doing great, babe,
          doing great.

05:12.479 --> 05:15.314
      That, that's draggi--
     Never mind, it's good.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.689
         You look great.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.705
       Why didn't you guys
       take the elevator?

05:39.707 --> 05:41.039
 Ah, I think it's out of order.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.641
  -It's a little temperamental.
             -Ah-ha.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.343
       I haven't seen you
       since your wedding.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.111
     -Well, you smell nice.
          -Oh, thanks.

05:46.113 --> 05:51.049
        You, look at you!
      You're, you're huge!

05:51.051 --> 05:55.587
            [panting]
        I can't breathe.
The baby's pressing on my lungs.

05:55.589 --> 05:59.458
      -Ah, you look great.
        -Ah-hah, thanks.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.860
         -This is Wayne.
       -[Wayne] laughing.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.862
   So nice to meet you, Wayne.

06:03.864 --> 06:07.065
       Ah, pregnant women
       smell so wonderful.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.101
              Okay.

06:09.103 --> 06:10.869
           I'm sorry,
   but where's your bathroom?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.571
   Oh um, through the curtain.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.407
              Wow.

06:34.828 --> 06:39.498
  This is a wonderfully buttery
  chardonnay we found in Napa.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.633
   Awesome. Babe do you wanna
     put that in the fridge?

06:43.036 --> 06:44.069
       You found this OK?

06:45.639 --> 06:48.039
          Yeah, someone
   threw something at our car.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.108
     -What are you driving?
           -Cadillac.

06:50.110 --> 06:53.178
              -Hmm.
-I'm parked right out front, you
  think the car is gonna be OK?

06:53.180 --> 06:56.448
          I don't know,
      we don't have a car.

06:56.450 --> 06:57.616
         We were looking
     at a building near here

06:57.618 --> 06:59.418
    I was thinking of buying.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.686
   -Yeah, Karen said the whole
         building, huh?
             -Yeah.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.755
           Six floors,
  5,000 square feet per floor.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.557
           Holy shit!

07:05.559 --> 07:07.659
Yeah, originally I thought maybe
   we'd do one unit per floor.

07:07.661 --> 07:10.695
            But this
   neighborhood is a little--

07:10.697 --> 07:12.764
    -Were you thinking about
        living here?
          -No, god no.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.434
   -[Wayne] It's really real.
    -It's a little too real.

07:15.436 --> 07:16.468
           [Tina] Uh.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.040
      Uh, thank you, Wayne.

07:23.177 --> 07:25.510
        So how long have
      you guys lived here?

07:25.512 --> 07:28.180
          -[Tina] Uh...
 -[Don] You got this place when?

07:28.182 --> 07:31.082
  Well, you should have seen it
         when I got it.

07:31.084 --> 07:34.920
    This guy was like running
  a motorcycle shop out of it,

07:34.922 --> 07:40.625
  but he was growing psilocybin
 mushrooms in cat shit upstairs.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.695
    For years. It smelt like
  cat shit whenever it rained.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.564
       -How intoxicating.
              -Huh.

07:46.533 --> 07:50.101
      -So it's two floors?
        -Yeah, yeah,
     my studio is upstairs.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.636
       Wow, that's great.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.673
    Oh my god, the squirrel.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.874
          [she laughs]

07:55.876 --> 07:57.943
    Oh my god, the squirrel.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.512
  Hey, you know that's actually
   our favorite wedding gift.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.013
        You bought that?

08:02.015 --> 08:04.516
       Don, did I tell you
 that thing about them eloping?

08:04.518 --> 08:06.518
              -No.
     -Tina wanted to elope.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.020
       No, no, no, no, no,
     Wayne wanted to elope.

08:09.022 --> 08:12.724
     Right. And so Tina left
   a cantaloupe on the counter

08:12.726 --> 08:15.494
           with a note
    that said "can't elope".

08:15.496 --> 08:16.761
             Get it?

08:16.763 --> 08:18.063
          -Can't elope.
     -You did tell me that.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.932
 But then we did. In Fiji, argh!

08:20.934 --> 08:24.903
         You should see
    the marriage certificate,
   the guy was drunk on cava.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.571
  That signature was priceless.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.640
           -[laughing]
           -Hilarious.

08:28.642 --> 08:32.510
  -Ooo, would you look at that
    belly! How crazy is that?
         -Eight months?

08:32.513 --> 08:35.046
 Have you read Ina May Gaskin's
      guide to childbirth?

08:35.048 --> 08:36.748
         -His favorite.
              -No.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.885
      Oh, you must. I mean
 the part about orgasmic birth.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.087
      -[Wayne] Incredible.
         -[Karen] Woah!

08:43.823 --> 08:46.791
   Did you know amniotic fluid
       is actually urine?

08:46.793 --> 08:49.694
     -Let's open that wine.
      -[laughs] Good idea.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.230
          Well, I made
  fresh orange juice for Karen.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.032
          -Folic acid.
           -Thank you.

08:55.836 --> 08:56.968
          He is sweet.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.037
            Isn't he?

09:25.933 --> 09:29.834
 -Don, look at all this artwork.
      -Yeah, it's all stuff
        our friends did.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.238
       -That's Lee Majors.
          -The artist?

09:33.240 --> 09:36.341
      [Tina] The portrait?
     Six million dollar man.

09:36.343 --> 09:39.978
   [laughs] It's nice you put
     your friends stuff up.

09:41.615 --> 09:44.249
  [Tina] Oh sorry, are you OK?

09:44.251 --> 09:46.084
      I'm OK. I'm alright.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.086
      -[Tina] I'm so sorry.
        -I'm OK, I'm OK.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.222
    [Don] Hey Wayne, are you
 following that Mets game today?

09:51.224 --> 09:53.925
     Oh, we don't have a TV.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.228
   OK, so who's not drinking?

09:57.230 --> 09:59.331
  I'm abstaining in solidarity.

09:59.333 --> 10:02.834
             -Karen?
      -I, I don't want Don
        to feel left out.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.803
           -Thank you.
     -Are you using a pelvic
        floor stretcher?

10:04.805 --> 10:06.037
          What? Wayne.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.340
              -Um.
         -It's amazing.

10:08.342 --> 10:12.677
 It's basically a latex balloon
   that you insert internally,

10:12.679 --> 10:14.913
 to train the vagina to stretch.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.983
     You know, so you don't
    get any perinatal tearing
        during delivery.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.351
              -Wow.
           -Wow, yeah.

10:19.353 --> 10:21.286
     -I really recommend it.
           -Thank you.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.855
    [Wayne] At the very least
          you should be
    doing perinatal massage.

10:23.857 --> 10:27.092
              -OK.
      -It's not too unlike
   anal training for ass-play.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.794
             -Okay.
       -Cheers then, ahh.

10:29.796 --> 10:33.298
          Cheers to a--
   Wait, wait, boy or a girl?

10:34.368 --> 10:36.334
  I wanted Don to be surprised.

10:37.804 --> 10:38.870
        Don wants a boy.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.706
     Why would you say that?

10:41.708 --> 10:43.141
           Wild guess.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.711
     Oh, we recently learned
      this wonderful thing.

10:46.713 --> 10:50.882
  When toasting, the eyes meet,
and the glasses find each other.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.286
           -[giggles]
            -Cheers.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.188
       -[glasses clinking]
            -Cheers.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.661
        -Oh, that's tart.
            -Oh dank.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.063
   This is frickin' delicious!

11:05.065 --> 11:06.798
       -Glad you like it.
        -[glasses chink]

11:06.800 --> 11:10.268
      You know it's illegal
 to sell pregnant women alcohol

11:10.270 --> 11:12.103
in New York City and cigarettes.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.739
         I think that's
   outrageously paternalistic.

11:14.741 --> 11:17.375
    I don't think the rights
   of pregnant women to smoke

11:17.377 --> 11:19.878
 is not the most pressing issue
      to devote oneself to.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.948
         It's the state
     creeping into our lives
    that's what's insidious.

11:23.950 --> 11:24.983
   I actually agree with that.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.951
           Thank you.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.921
        A woman gives up
     her rights as an adult
     when she gets pregnant?

11:29.923 --> 11:31.122
       Her right to drink.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.291
      -Her right to choose.
           -To drink?

11:33.293 --> 11:35.093
      [chuckles] And smoke.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.065
  -You really don't have a TV?
              -No.

11:40.066 --> 11:41.065
   Tina, are you still making
   those clothes out of money?

11:41.068 --> 11:42.300
  That's not what I was doing.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.368
        It was something
        like that though.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.870
   It was about the aesthetic

11:45.872 --> 11:49.140
   of it, the design of money
      and the materialism.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.076
         That's actually
      how Wayne and I met.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.477
            Oh, yes.

11:52.479 --> 11:55.180
    Wayne had this magazine,
      literary slash art--

11:55.182 --> 11:56.948
      Yeah, but it wasn't,
         it wasn't mine.

11:56.950 --> 12:00.218
[Tina] Well, he was part of this
   magazine collective thingy

12:00.220 --> 12:02.087
     and he interviewed me.

12:02.089 --> 12:05.724
       And I took him home
       and he never left.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.859
So that's what you do, Wayne?

12:07.861 --> 12:10.962
      -No, no, not anymore.
       -So what do you do?

12:11.998 --> 12:16.067
      I don't define myself
        by my work, Don.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.203
   [pats him on the shoulder]

12:18.205 --> 12:20.138
    Don, did I ever tell you
   about that museum gift shop
      thing that Tina did?

12:20.140 --> 12:21.372
               No.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.807
         I can't believe
       you remember that.

12:22.809 --> 12:23.975
     I still have that pin.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.778
         Seriously? Aw.

12:26.780 --> 12:29.481
     But what are you doing?
     How's your photography?

12:29.483 --> 12:31.216
          Oh, I haven't
      done that for years.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.517
   That was totally temporary.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.854
          You were such
      a great photographer.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.123
  I was a medical photographer.

12:38.125 --> 12:41.926
     Why didn't you ever do
   that show like I told you?
   That was such a great idea.

12:41.928 --> 12:45.063
Tina wanted me to do an art show
      with my photography.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.798
        You photographed
        peoples' lesions.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.934
    It was such a great idea.
   Someone would write it up.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.008
   Don's becoming a little bit
         of a collector.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.910
         [Tina] Really?

12:58.912 --> 13:01.212
    -Who are you collecting?
         -Uh, I just got
       a Gerhard Richter.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.848
            -Really?
   -I helped him pick it out.

13:03.850 --> 13:06.217
  Hey, art appreciates even if
     I don't appreciate art.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.920
     Have you read his book
<i>The Daily Practice of Painting?</i>

13:08.922 --> 13:10.155
          I don't know
    jack shit about the guy.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.892
         -[phone rings]
        -Don't get that.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.527
    [Karen] Oh, you guys can
          take a call.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.162
           No, u-hum.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.331
      -[phone rings again]
     -She knows we're here.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.900
 She also knows we have company.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.336
          [phone rings]
      -I, I wanna take it.
             -Don't.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.438
        One second, Kiki.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.175
        Kiki, who's Kiki?

13:30.177 --> 13:32.877
        Uh, are you guys
        gonna breastfeed?

13:34.347 --> 13:35.814
              Yeah.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.315
    I mean, I'm planning to.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.918
    It's weird, right? A kid
  hanging off your boob all day

13:39.920 --> 13:41.452
   like some kind of... tick.

13:41.454 --> 13:44.989
      -Pretty distracting.
   -Or bonding and beautiful.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.124
          Jeeze, Tina.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.293
      Ideally it's bonding,

13:48.295 --> 13:50.595
  but when you have shit to do
    I don't know, I wouldn't
          want someone

13:50.597 --> 13:54.265
 sucking on my nipples all day.
   I mean, in a perfect world.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.934
Well, I'm looking forward to it.

13:55.936 --> 13:59.037
       It's kind of one of
    life's great experiences.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.339
      Yeah, no sorry, um--

14:01.341 --> 14:04.943
     I've just been thinking
     about this stuff a lot.

14:04.945 --> 14:05.910
             I, um--

14:06.880 --> 14:08.246
   I'm actually doing a piece

14:08.248 --> 14:10.114
         -on motherhood.
            -Really?

14:10.116 --> 14:12.016
          It's gonna be
      a long term project.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.919
    Like a major life's work.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.955
 I started collecting baby books

14:16.957 --> 14:20.191
   and I'm interviewing people
     who work in orphanages

14:20.193 --> 14:22.894
        -and zookeepers.
          -Zookeepers?

14:22.896 --> 14:24.596
    Daughters, mothers, men.

14:24.598 --> 14:26.364
       Abortion providers.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.100
           I've gotten
      really into bronzing,

14:29.102 --> 14:33.071
       you know like, uh,
       baby shoe bronzing

14:33.073 --> 14:35.206
   and collecting baby teeth--

14:36.409 --> 14:40.144
        It's called EGG,
       or EGG Provocation.

14:41.615 --> 14:44.148
        It's a commission
      from the new museum.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.884
              Wow!

14:45.886 --> 14:47.418
       That's great, Tina.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.587
          Good for you.

14:52.626 --> 14:55.927
  Do you find that people don't
 know what to talk to you about
      when you're pregnant?

14:55.929 --> 14:57.095
        It's like this...

14:58.131 --> 14:59.631
         awkward thing.

14:59.633 --> 15:03.301
    Like, like when someone's
         terminally ill,

15:03.303 --> 15:05.169
 and you're supposed to ask them
  all these medical questions.

15:05.171 --> 15:08.606
          I, I'm sorry.
   Is it bad that I said that?

15:08.608 --> 15:12.076
  No, it's just that it's more
     like being a celebrity.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.312
        I feel like I get
   all this special attention.

15:14.314 --> 15:20.485
       I feel very admired
     and loved... and lucky.

15:22.022 --> 15:25.089
            -Really?
          -Although...

15:25.091 --> 15:26.591
         It can be weird

15:26.593 --> 15:28.993
     when you're with people
    that don't have children.

15:28.995 --> 15:32.931
          -Why is that?
   -I don't know, you feel...

15:34.000 --> 15:35.400
          I don't know,

15:35.402 --> 15:37.635
    sorry for them, I guess.

15:43.343 --> 15:46.377
   I'm gonna get some cheese.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.220
          You shut up.
   [giggling under her breath]

15:56.222 --> 15:58.957
    -Hey, you wanted to come.
      -She's just insecure.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.459
    She's nuts, I can't take
      another hour of this.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.729
            Stop it.
    We're gonna have dinner.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.632
        -What does he do?
             -Quiet.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.634
   I mean look at this place.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.603
 I'm gonna go check on the car.

16:14.040 --> 16:17.175
    -And listen to the game?
           -Mm, maybe.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.546
           Oh uh, hey,
     everything OK in there?

16:21.548 --> 16:23.047
        Hey, yeah thanks.

16:23.049 --> 16:26.484
            -Cheese?
    -Pregnancy-safe cheeses.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.019
       It's so thoughtful.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.054
     Hey, did you tell them
        about the house?

16:30.056 --> 16:31.055
               No.

16:32.726 --> 16:33.992
             Well--

16:33.994 --> 16:37.695
Don acquired quite a bit of land
    on this incredible island

16:37.697 --> 16:39.163
       in the Puget Sound.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.132
              -Wow.
  -And we thought with the baby

16:41.134 --> 16:43.735
 it would be wonderful to build
  this really special retreat.

16:43.737 --> 16:45.403
Ah, we have an old family friend
       who's an architect.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.639
   -He's really into ecology.
       -As architects are.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.509
    He designed and built us
      this fantastic place.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.578
    You didn't even tell me.

16:53.580 --> 16:57.482
        He used all these
      local materials like
  old telephone poles and glass

16:57.484 --> 16:59.417
   and stone, but it's modern.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.020
 It's really like a work of art.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.222
   Dad did everything, I mean
     furniture, appliances.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.391
   He shipped us this amazing
  energy efficiency dishwasher

17:06.393 --> 17:07.325
     all the way from Italy.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.726
      Defeats the purpose.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.194
      [Karen] And I've been
      keeping these folders

17:10.195 --> 17:12.797
        of sink fixtures,
    counter tops and whatever

17:12.799 --> 17:14.732
     and John the architect
     really liked my ideas.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.402
       I have always said
      you had great ideas.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.171
        It really is like
       living in a dream.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.776
       Ah, you know what?
        We have news too.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.612
           We, we do?

17:27.614 --> 17:31.115
            -Tell'em.
        -Uh, you tell'em.

17:31.117 --> 17:33.317
    You are the first people
      we've told, you tell.

17:33.319 --> 17:36.187
          I don't want
      to make any mistakes.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.756
          -You tell'em.
        -You guys, what?

17:38.758 --> 17:42.226
  We're having a baby too, yay!

17:42.228 --> 17:45.396
           -Oh my god!
            -[laughs]

17:45.398 --> 17:46.531
          [Karen] Tina!

17:46.533 --> 17:48.566
     That's great, you guys!

17:48.568 --> 17:51.502
        -Ahh, nice work.
              -Wow!

17:51.504 --> 17:52.804
     How far along are you?

17:52.806 --> 17:54.705
             -Uhm...
           -11 weeks.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.140
         11 weeks, yeah.

17:56.142 --> 17:56.774
  -Are you feeling sick at all?
              -No.

17:56.776 --> 17:57.775
       Never felt better.

17:57.777 --> 17:58.810
         -That's great.
             -Yeah.

17:58.812 --> 18:01.779
           Wow, I am--

18:04.484 --> 18:09.320
         -That's great.
       -Yeah, well, we are
    in the club too, cheers!

18:09.322 --> 18:15.293
        Here Tina, I hate
     when people lecture me.

18:15.295 --> 18:19.297
   But fetal alcohol syndrome
    is actually very serious.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.132
           Especially
     in the first trimester.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.534
          -Yeah, sorry.
        -I know you have
     your political stance.

18:23.536 --> 18:26.571
          I, I forgot.
   I'm not actually pregnant.

18:26.573 --> 18:30.108
  -We have a surrogate mother.
              -Hm.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.209
            Oh.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.777
               Oh.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.545
            -Oh wow!
             -Yeah.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.414
             -Yeah.
        -Oh, a surrogate?

18:36.416 --> 18:38.616
             -Yeah.
      -We know a gay couple
          who did that.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.885
             -We do?
         -Yeah, the guy
 who did our window treatments.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.787
              Okay.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.455
 Did you have to go through all
 that awful IVF fertility stuff?

18:44.457 --> 18:45.857
               No.

18:45.859 --> 18:47.859
       -Well, that's good.
     -Yeah, no I can, I mean

18:47.861 --> 18:51.129
             we can.
   This was more of an option.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.865
             -Okay?
            -Er, um.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.400
  Sort of a utopian pregnancy.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.203
      A utopian pregnancy?

18:59.205 --> 19:01.906
  It's sort of err, dismantling

19:01.908 --> 19:04.876
      and restructuring of
  the traditional family unit.

19:04.878 --> 19:10.548
   A re-distribution of rules
    to a more shared economy
         kind of thing.

19:10.550 --> 19:13.618
            -Kind of.
       -You are the first
       people we've told,

19:13.620 --> 19:15.486
      we don't really have
        the rap down yet.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.822
           So you can
     have the baby yourself?

19:17.824 --> 19:22.193
     Right, yes I-- we can,
        we choose not to.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.162
      You're paying someone
    to have the baby for you?

19:24.164 --> 19:25.196
              Yeah.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.497
            Perfect!

19:28.168 --> 19:31.402
          Wait, is this
      part of your project?

19:31.404 --> 19:34.705
         -Actually, yes.
  -So this was her idea, right?

19:34.707 --> 19:37.241
             -Yeah.
         -Look, it's a,
     it's a shared project.

19:37.243 --> 19:38.709
         Right. I'm just
    the one who conceived it.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.511
   The project, not the baby.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.247
         Yeah, of course
     the project obviously.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.283
 It's a collaborative endeavor.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.185
      Kiki's the one who's
     having the actual baby.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.854
      Yeah, I'm just saying
         it was my idea.

19:49.856 --> 19:53.324
 I hardly think that it's right
      to discount the labor
       that goes into it.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.726
 Just because you're controlling
    the means of production.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.428
      Mm, that sounds hot.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.430
I'm obviously saying this from--

19:59.432 --> 20:00.798
         Why don't you,
    why don't you tell them?

20:00.800 --> 20:01.899
      Didn't wanna get fat?

20:01.901 --> 20:04.502
            -Thanks.
     -Not particularly, no.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.637
        Didn't want to be
         inconvenienced.

20:06.639 --> 20:12.210
      No, but its more that
     because the traditional
      family role structure

20:12.212 --> 20:13.911
           is obsolete

20:13.913 --> 20:17.982
 and pretty much sucks for women
      and men and children,

20:18.885 --> 20:19.984
     I decided to change it.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.353
      What sucks about it?

20:22.355 --> 20:25.656
  Well, I think Tina feels that
      there are issues with
       traditional roles.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.659
    I mean, I wouldn't wanna
     be a mother. Would you?

20:30.396 --> 20:32.830
   -But you wanna have a baby!
         -[Tina] Err...

20:33.800 --> 20:35.766
        Do you want
      to have a baby, Tina?

20:35.768 --> 20:37.902
  We hired a surrogate mother.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.738
    -And this person that you
     hired is going to be--
          -The mother.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.707
    She will have that title.

20:42.709 --> 20:47.245
Yes, whatever that means, that's
 what she wanted. God love her.

20:47.247 --> 20:50.748
  -Did you bone the surrogate?
           -Oh my god.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.885
      Tina's egg fertilized
 with my sperm was transplanted
     into our friends womb.

20:54.887 --> 20:59.991
         Ah, naturally.
    Transplanted into-- Yeah.

20:59.993 --> 21:02.760
     We were both there when
   they introduced the zygote.

21:02.762 --> 21:03.728
         Must have been
       a precious moment.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.029
       So it is your egg?

21:05.031 --> 21:07.498
        Yes, it's my egg
       and Wayne's sperm.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.835
   Look, some women are really
       into giving birth.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.771
        Others just do it
     for reasons of vanity.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.540
            -Vanity.
        -Or ego or guilt.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.042
       If you didn't have
        to do it yourself

21:18.044 --> 21:19.477
    why else would you do it?

21:19.479 --> 21:22.046
     It's not unlike having

21:22.048 --> 21:24.649
  assistants execute your art.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.417
       You have to learn.
        how to delegate.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.686
      I think tons of women
 would love to do what I'm doing

21:28.688 --> 21:31.555
    -they're just not ballsy
        enough to do it.
   -And you're ballsy enough?

21:32.859 --> 21:36.794
If government and businesses are
  going to devalue women's work

21:36.796 --> 21:40.498
       and make motherhood
    economically unfeasible,

21:40.500 --> 21:42.967
   why not outsource it until
  they make it worth our whiles

21:42.969 --> 21:45.870
         to keep babies
   in their own mothers wombs.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.539
Yes, yes. [clicking his fingers]

21:48.541 --> 21:50.041
       You see this is why
      people hate liberals.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.942
         Is this a joke
   or are you guys doing this?

21:51.944 --> 21:53.344
     We're really doing it.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.014
   If you don't wanna have the
child, why don't you just adopt?

21:57.016 --> 21:59.650
         -Why don't you?
         -Why don't you?

22:00.553 --> 22:03.054
   Well, Wayne was really into
 having his own genetics, so...

22:03.056 --> 22:04.755
          So were you.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.757
   Oh, I didn't really want it
      to be yours and hers.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.759
     -That's not the point.
         -Oh, you don't
       want it to be hers.

22:08.761 --> 22:09.960
          But you want
      her to be the mother.

22:09.962 --> 22:13.064
           Um, Tina is

22:13.066 --> 22:14.332
       like a sperm donor.

22:14.334 --> 22:15.966
 I'm so not like a sperm donor.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.935
         I mean, you're,
      you're an egg donor.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.470
          No, I'm not.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.639
     Well, she's the mother
          what are you?

22:21.641 --> 22:22.840
        I don't know.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.042
  I haven't put a label on it.

22:25.044 --> 22:28.879
That's the most interesting part
       about it, I get to

22:28.881 --> 22:30.815
        create the role.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.717
              Fun.

22:32.719 --> 22:35.353
             [sighs]
     I'm just not into being
     hormonally brainwashed

22:35.355 --> 22:37.655
 into this unhealthy attachment

22:37.657 --> 22:39.857
         that women have
       with their babies.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.559
      Unhealthy attachment?

22:41.561 --> 22:42.660
       It's not unhealthy.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.662
       A child needs this.

22:44.664 --> 22:47.465
   And it's not an attachment,
       it's a connection.

22:48.434 --> 22:51.736
       I already feel this
     incredible connection.

22:52.605 --> 22:53.637
             Great.

22:53.639 --> 22:58.876
  I'm looking forward to having
 a different kind of connection.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.779
One that's less based on biology

23:01.781 --> 23:03.848
  and quite frankly economics.

23:03.850 --> 23:07.118
 -What is that supposed to mean?
  -I'm not against having kids.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.720
          I love kids.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.021
        They're awesome.

23:11.023 --> 23:14.392
  I prefer kids to most adults,
            I mean--

23:15.661 --> 23:18.929
 Raising a child, talk about an,

23:18.931 --> 23:21.799
     an amazing experiment.

23:21.801 --> 23:25.169
  So, you're really having more
  of an experiment than a baby?

23:25.171 --> 23:27.671
      It's more like making
         a work of art.

23:27.673 --> 23:32.676
      I'm not creating her,
I'm allowing her into existence.

23:32.678 --> 23:33.744
      You're having a girl?

23:33.746 --> 23:36.881
   Yeah, I mean well 90% yeah.

23:36.883 --> 23:40.050
    It's early, but you could
       buy these DNA tests
       at like Walgreens.

23:40.052 --> 23:42.620
    You can tell at 11 weeks.

23:44.524 --> 23:45.756
         Wow, you guys.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.626
         [Don chuckles]

23:48.628 --> 23:51.495
   OK, it's not unlike cheese.

23:53.132 --> 23:57.101
   Cheese was created as a way
        to preserve milk

23:57.103 --> 23:58.536
 before there was refrigeration.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.538
          But we don't
      need cheese anymore.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.807
      But we fetishize it,
        it's become this

24:02.809 --> 24:06.010
      highly stylized thing
  we've developed a taste for.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.745
    Having a baby the old way

24:07.747 --> 24:11.048
is a total fetish at this point.

24:11.050 --> 24:14.485
I'm not doing anything different
         than a gay mom.

24:14.487 --> 24:16.520
       Or, or a trans mom.

24:16.522 --> 24:18.556
           -Or a Don.
            -Perfect.

24:18.558 --> 24:19.757
   I think I need some water.

24:19.759 --> 24:20.825
          -I'll get it.
          -I'll get it.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.626
          I'll get it.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.971
   [Tina] I'm just saying that
   maybe if your mother hadn't

24:33.973 --> 24:35.973
        endured the pain
      of childbirth for you

24:35.975 --> 24:37.608
         and sacrificed
      her identity for you,

24:37.610 --> 24:39.710
 -you wouldn't screen her calls.
           -Thank you.

24:39.712 --> 24:42.613
        Ahem, I'm curious

24:42.615 --> 24:46.550
        about this friend
        you impregnated.

24:46.552 --> 24:50.921
         -Heh, uh, Kiki?
          -Yeah, Kiki.

24:50.923 --> 24:53.190
          -That was her
      on the phone before?
             -Yeah.

24:53.192 --> 24:56.527
  She very much wanted to give
    birth, but her situation
   was such that she couldn't.

24:56.529 --> 25:00.030
        Her... situation

25:00.032 --> 25:03.033
           -was such?
         -Let's just say
        it works for her.

25:03.035 --> 25:06.170
   We're gonna be three people
  without preconceived notions

25:06.172 --> 25:08.105
      of designated roles.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.206
              Four.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.708
           -Four what?
          -Four people.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.978
           -With Kiki.
      -Yes four, obviously.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.846
         Is she going to
     take care of the baby?

25:15.848 --> 25:17.815
       We're going to work
those things out as we go along.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.550
     Are you having a nanny?

25:19.552 --> 25:22.119
       Yeah, I mean, yeah.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.788
        -[Karen chuckles]
         -So how is that
       different from me?

25:25.958 --> 25:27.658
         It's different.

25:27.660 --> 25:30.861
       Meanwhile the kids
 usually like the nanny better.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.129
         No, they don't!

25:32.131 --> 25:35.599
        I'm gonna be like
    the fun, sexy nanny then.

25:35.601 --> 25:36.667
   Is Kiki moving in with you?

25:36.669 --> 25:38.102
              -No.
       -Maybe temporarily.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.271
     You're figuring it out
           as you go.

25:40.273 --> 25:42.006
     She's not living here.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.974
       Don't eat too much.

25:43.976 --> 25:47.144
   Oh, these cheeses are from
   this lesbian couple upstate

25:47.146 --> 25:49.647
            that name
    each one of their goats.

25:49.649 --> 25:52.082
  Stop fetishizing the cheese.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.285
       Hmm-hmm, fuck off.

25:54.287 --> 25:56.887
    Oh my god, I was kidding!

25:58.591 --> 26:01.825
 People have the most fucked up
    reasons for having kids.

26:01.827 --> 26:04.995
   I know women who have them
   just to jump social class.

26:04.997 --> 26:07.231
        Or, or to hang on
       to their husbands.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.600
    Meanwhile, half the time
   the guy doesn't want to be
  a father in the first place.

26:09.602 --> 26:13.037
 -He's just going along with it.
      -Jesus Christ, Tina!

26:14.006 --> 26:16.140
    It's not all so sinister.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.742
  It's actually one of the most
    beautiful things in life.

26:18.744 --> 26:22.680
     And I, I think it's sad
 that you can't see it that way.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.718
         Well, I do too.

26:29.288 --> 26:34.925
    So Kiki is whose friend?

26:37.630 --> 26:41.098
 -She originally was my friend.
       -[Don gently hmms]

26:41.100 --> 26:44.134
  She was temping at the place
  where Wayne was freelancing.

26:45.104 --> 26:48.238
            -Classic.
     -Did you talk to anyone
      before you did this?

26:48.240 --> 26:51.775
     Did you talk to anyone
      before you did this?

26:51.777 --> 26:54.278
               No.

26:54.280 --> 26:58.382
You didn't ask us if we'd talked
  to anyone when you thought we
 were having a regular old baby.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.117
   You thought it was awesome.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.619
       Actually I didn't.

27:02.622 --> 27:03.687
             Really?

27:03.689 --> 27:07.157
   I mean I was happy for you,
      but I was surprised.

27:07.994 --> 27:11.395
 You-- You're a little selfish.

27:12.264 --> 27:15.165
  [Tina chuckles] I'm selfish?

27:16.168 --> 27:17.635
         A little, yeah.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.038
      You know I don't even
    think this sounds legal.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.940
             Legal?

27:22.942 --> 27:25.042
 Legal, that's not a moral code
 I'm particularly interested in.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.311
        -So you and Kiki
     don't have a contract?
              -No.

27:27.313 --> 27:30.714
              -No.
      -All these privileges
       for married people

27:30.716 --> 27:33.283
    and families, tax breaks
      and health insurance

27:33.285 --> 27:35.653
  -and Green Cards, it's sick.
    -Why did you get married?

27:36.756 --> 27:38.856
        Wayne was broke,
   you gotta work the system.

27:38.858 --> 27:42.426
         -[phone rings]
        -Don't get that.

27:47.266 --> 27:48.365
         Hang on a sec.

27:50.436 --> 27:53.137
   You know for a minute there
  I forgot all about the game.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.875
  I like Scandinavian mothers.

27:57.877 --> 28:01.111
       They're so relaxed.

28:01.113 --> 28:04.748
       I could totally be
       like a Danish mom.

28:06.285 --> 28:07.451
           What's up?

28:07.453 --> 28:09.353
        -She told Clark.
       -Argh, that idiot.

28:09.355 --> 28:12.389
     -Wait, hang on hang on
        you're going out?
             -Wait.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.391
      I could go with you.
      We could take my car.

28:14.393 --> 28:15.993
         -[Wayne] Great.
             -Wayne.
              -Don.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.127
    I'll be right back, Tina.

28:17.129 --> 28:19.863
             -Okay.
             -Wait!

28:19.865 --> 28:22.166
           -Have fun.
  -[Tina] When are you-- Wayne.

28:31.911 --> 28:35.279
       -[elevator clunks]
    -It does that sometimes.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.381
  [elevator stops, then starts]

28:48.828 --> 28:50.994
             [music]

28:57.136 --> 29:00.003
     You know why Don went?
       He wants to listen
     to the game in the car.

29:03.375 --> 29:06.877
 -I'm sorry if I got a little--
             -Yeah.

29:06.879 --> 29:09.747
         It's just, this
   whole thing with Kiki is--

29:09.749 --> 29:11.882
         What happened?
    Who's this guy she told?

29:11.884 --> 29:13.150
        Kiki's boyfriend

29:13.152 --> 29:14.852
         who's married.

29:14.854 --> 29:17.121
    -Her boyfriend's married?
        -With five kids.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.156
        Are you serious?

29:19.158 --> 29:22.526
       Well, four or five,
    five if you count the one
       in the institution.

29:22.528 --> 29:24.962
          Yeah, the one
   in the institution counts.

29:24.964 --> 29:25.996
         So, five then.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.833
          I feel dizzy,
      do you have any food?

29:29.835 --> 29:31.502
         Oh yeah, sorry.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.938
 So go straight and to the left.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.274
     [the game on the radio
       in the background]

29:39.912 --> 29:40.895
        We're not far.

29:40.896 --> 29:41.879
    Hey, we can drag this out
      as long as you like.

29:43.249 --> 29:44.882
       You want me to put
     that seat back for you?

29:50.823 --> 29:52.556
            -Better?
             -Yeah.

29:55.060 --> 29:57.394
       -You want some air?
             -Yeah.

30:04.937 --> 30:08.071
 Oh my god, Karen, I'm so sorry.
     You must be so hungry.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.876
 Wayne made this Ethiopian dish.

30:12.878 --> 30:15.112
         Oo, what is it?

30:15.114 --> 30:17.514
              -Wat.
             -What?

30:17.516 --> 30:20.918
        -Wat, that's wat.
              -Oh.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.387
Thank you so much. I'm starving.

30:24.490 --> 30:28.258
 I'm sorry. I was supposed to be
  Wayne's [indistinct] tonight.

30:29.562 --> 30:32.196
       -I totally spaced.
       -It's really good.

30:33.532 --> 30:37.134
           Really? Mm.

30:38.237 --> 30:42.072
       -This is good chow.
  -Mm, this is seriously good.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.441
      Hey, I wanna show you
       something upstairs.

30:46.045 --> 30:48.846
       -You still smoking?
  -Yeah, but not in the house.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.974
    Where did you get these?

31:16.976 --> 31:19.643
    People kept on sending us
    pictures of their kids,

31:19.645 --> 31:22.479
     so I just blew 'em up.

31:22.481 --> 31:26.283
   Do your ex-boyfriends send
   you pictures of their kids
          all the time?

31:26.285 --> 31:28.652
              -No.
            -Mine do.

31:28.654 --> 31:35.292
  Do you think it's this weird
 sexual overture or aggression?

31:35.294 --> 31:38.662
   -Maybe they're just proud.
           -Doubt it.

31:38.664 --> 31:43.233
       Remember Marcello,
      the organic herb guy
    from the farmers market?

31:43.235 --> 31:45.936
            -Vaguely.
        -That's his son.

31:45.938 --> 31:47.471
          He's so cute!

31:49.041 --> 31:51.108
             Entre.

31:59.184 --> 32:02.686
      It does sort of smell
     like cat piss in here.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.087
         [Tina giggles]

32:05.257 --> 32:08.926
           [cat meows]

32:08.928 --> 32:09.960
              Wow.

32:09.962 --> 32:17.034
  I've been collecting jewelry,
         that women make
       out of baby teeth.

32:17.937 --> 32:22.239
   Necklaces with their kids'
    initials and names on it.

32:22.241 --> 32:25.709
         Like this weird
     ostentatious conquest.

32:27.513 --> 32:30.714
   So Kiki's married boyfriend

32:30.716 --> 32:32.649
had no idea she was doing this?

32:32.651 --> 32:37.187
 They were taking a break after
  he fired her from his office.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.455
             Oh god.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.357
       Well, you have all
       these single women

32:40.359 --> 32:43.260
 in these extra marital affairs
     who want to be mothers.

32:43.262 --> 32:45.562
  Well, maybe they shouldn't be
    in extra marital affairs.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.331
         Yeah, dream on!

32:52.538 --> 32:54.204
  This just seems really weird.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.340
       You don't seem like
    you want to have a baby.

32:59.712 --> 33:02.212
 Wayne didn't want it till June.

33:02.214 --> 33:06.450
          When we met,
   he was totally against it.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.219
       We agreed, I mean--

33:09.221 --> 33:12.589
    It was a big part of why
we were attracted to each other.

33:12.591 --> 33:15.625
           We believed
     in perfect bi-solation.

33:15.627 --> 33:20.497
           Two people,
     alone together in love.

33:20.499 --> 33:24.267
     We thought having kids
      was a kind of agenda.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.306
    And then I got pregnant.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.410
               Oh.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.679
     Which was an accident.

33:35.681 --> 33:36.780
              When?

33:38.083 --> 33:39.416
        Like a year ago.

33:42.588 --> 33:45.622
           -Oh, Tina.
             -Yeah.

33:48.060 --> 33:52.229
   We um, decided against it.

33:53.132 --> 33:56.666
 Against the pregnancy, because

33:56.668 --> 33:59.636
we agreed and it was an accident

33:59.638 --> 34:01.438
    and we didn't want them,

34:01.440 --> 34:04.741
      and we agreed, so...

34:06.245 --> 34:07.377
          We ended it.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.047
         Was that hard?

34:15.821 --> 34:17.353
              Yeah.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.190
         Oh, I'm sorry.

34:23.495 --> 34:26.295
       Anyway, after that
       we were suddenly--

34:27.800 --> 34:30.600
          It was weird,
      I mean he was always

34:30.601 --> 34:32.601
         good with kids,
       he would like them.

34:32.603 --> 34:37.174
          But suddenly,
   he just had to be a father.

34:38.077 --> 34:40.409
      -Had to have a baby.
              -Wow.

34:42.380 --> 34:45.782
          And then when
      Wayne met Kiki, and--

34:46.784 --> 34:50.320
   She wanted to be a mother,
       but she was in this
       stupid relationship

34:50.322 --> 34:53.190
       where she couldn't
         have one, and--

34:56.829 --> 35:01.631
 I started thinking, I could do
   as much as a father, right?

35:03.869 --> 35:04.835
              Huh.

35:11.110 --> 35:14.111
      Hmm, it was something
        he really wanted.

35:16.415 --> 35:19.282
        And I wanted him
    to have a life, you know.

35:22.387 --> 35:24.354
     What he really wanted.

35:31.396 --> 35:32.863
      Others have it easy.

35:35.634 --> 35:38.735
  Frickin' late, looking great.

35:39.872 --> 35:42.506
 My child, picture on the desk.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.841
         -I can do that.
            -Come on.

35:57.156 --> 35:59.189
        [splashing sound]

35:59.191 --> 36:00.157
           [laughing]

36:04.229 --> 36:06.930
     I just wanted to do it
  in a way that I could handle.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.904
       Why didn't you just
    try to get pregnant again
     and see what happened?

36:13.906 --> 36:16.773
             Uh-huh!

36:16.775 --> 36:22.646
     Well, I guess it's nice
    you're trying to give him
        what he wants.

36:24.583 --> 36:25.715
             Right.

36:29.288 --> 36:32.422
        -How old is Kiki?
   -Our age, a little younger.

36:39.565 --> 36:40.564
            Sit down.

36:54.446 --> 36:55.445
              Argh.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.647
       [electronic sounds]

36:57.649 --> 36:58.848
         Awesome, right?

37:03.589 --> 37:05.455
       Ahh, ha, ha, okay!

37:05.457 --> 37:09.492
         -[Tina giggles]
             -Okay.

37:09.494 --> 37:13.296
            Help. Ow.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.665
              -Ah.
          -Boy or girl?

37:17.336 --> 37:20.370
            -Oh god.
       -Come on, tell me.

37:23.275 --> 37:24.874
              -Boy.
              -Ooo.

37:24.876 --> 37:28.645
        -Don't tell Don.
         -A little boy.

37:28.647 --> 37:31.348
           Yeah, so...

37:32.684 --> 37:33.850
    Is that what you wanted?

37:35.587 --> 37:38.822
 I mean I guess I always thought
 I'd be happy with either, but--

37:40.525 --> 37:42.759
    I always pictured myself
       with a little girl.

37:44.596 --> 37:49.532
     Maybe I'm just not into
  super heroes and video games

37:49.534 --> 37:52.369
 -and dump trucks and reptiles.
           -Oh, honey.

37:52.371 --> 37:53.803
I don't, I hate science museums.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.439
       Oh, everybody hates
        science museums.

37:56.441 --> 37:57.474
             [sighs]

37:58.710 --> 38:00.810
    It'll be OK. I'll be OK.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.380
         It'll be great!

38:03.382 --> 38:05.348
   My friends say I'll forget
      I ever felt this way.

38:06.585 --> 38:08.918
Daughters steal your beauty
      when you're pregnant,

38:08.920 --> 38:10.687
    have you ever heard that?

38:10.689 --> 38:14.357
Yeah, Italians say that, I think

38:14.359 --> 38:16.359
        and traditionally
      everyone wanted boys,

38:16.361 --> 38:18.561
    so if you're going to be
 traditional, it's good, right?

38:20.032 --> 38:21.064
             Well...

38:21.066 --> 38:26.503
  Traditionally some countries
 like to drown baby girls, so--

38:27.472 --> 38:29.506
        -Fuck tradition.
          -Ha, ha, yes!

38:29.508 --> 38:31.508
     Please, fuck tradition.

38:32.511 --> 38:35.612
   Ah, I think a lot of people
   would love not to have kids

38:35.614 --> 38:38.348
    until they're brainwashed
    into thinking they won't
     be happy without them.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.083
      I see all these girls
      going up to college,

38:40.085 --> 38:42.619
   and I can't help but think
   why are we educating them,

38:42.621 --> 38:44.654
     why don't we send them
    straight from high school

38:44.656 --> 38:46.623
      -to Pilates if that's
      all they're gonna do?
             -Tina!

38:47.859 --> 38:49.993
       Stop attacking me!

38:52.798 --> 38:54.081
           Seriously!

38:54.082 --> 38:55.365
     I'm not attacking you.
      You're attacking me.

38:55.367 --> 38:56.966
     How am I attacking you?

38:56.968 --> 39:00.103
  Look at you, you're like this
   giant beach ball of bliss.

39:00.105 --> 39:02.605
        You're like this
   living monument of sexism,

39:02.607 --> 39:05.775
       you're so beautiful
        and glowing and--

39:14.920 --> 39:16.353
 I'm going to use the bathroom.

39:17.956 --> 39:21.558
  I'll, um, check on the guys.

39:23.095 --> 39:25.862
         I'm really glad
  you got a chance to see this.

39:28.100 --> 39:29.432
      [Karen] It's amazing.

39:31.636 --> 39:32.702
             Thanks.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.805
         I admire your--

39:37.576 --> 39:38.608
              You!

40:07.105 --> 40:10.073
       [answering machine]
<i>Hey this is Wayne. I'm not here</i>
  <i> right now, leave a message.</i>

40:10.075 --> 40:12.742
          Hey, it's me
      I'm just checking in.

40:13.578 --> 40:14.644
              Bye.

40:14.646 --> 40:18.581
  No one thinks that it's weird
      to wanna have a baby,

40:18.583 --> 40:21.851
  but basically you're inviting
       a complete stranger

40:21.853 --> 40:25.455
     you know nothing about
     into your life forever.

40:25.457 --> 40:28.458
        But people think
     adopting a foster child

40:28.460 --> 40:30.527
  or a helper monkey is insane.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.495
         [Karen sniffs]
 Did you just say helper monkey?

40:36.067 --> 40:37.600
         -[Karen sniffs]
           -Come here.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.975
     You look a mess, Karen.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.686
         [Karen sniffs]

41:08.900 --> 41:11.234
         This just isn't
    the greatest time for me.

41:12.838 --> 41:16.573
    We're actually-- [sniffs]

41:17.476 --> 41:18.908
      We're just not having
       the greatest time.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.710
     It's been really hard.

41:22.614 --> 41:25.949
        Wayne's so sweet,
   he's so into the pregnancy.

41:27.018 --> 41:30.920
Yeah well, just 'cause someone's
        loving and giving

41:30.922 --> 41:33.623
    doesn't mean they're not
  doing it for selfish reasons.

41:37.562 --> 41:39.195
Don's just at work all the time.

41:39.197 --> 41:42.031
        And he's just not
      like that, you know.

41:43.768 --> 41:48.137
         And I'm just...
        feeling insecure.

41:50.775 --> 41:53.543
      -You guys having sex?
              -No.

41:55.213 --> 41:56.846
  Are you getting on otherwise?

41:58.750 --> 42:01.618
   I mean, sure. [she sniffs]

42:01.620 --> 42:03.586
   Aside from the lack of sex

42:03.588 --> 42:08.625
    and him never being home
      and me yelling at him
         whenever he is.

42:08.627 --> 42:10.793
       -Great then. Yeah.
             -Yeah.

42:12.898 --> 42:14.964
Hey, clearly he's working it in.

42:16.601 --> 42:18.768
             -Yeah.
   -I mean, that was a factor.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.640
        Not everyone has
       a trust fund, Tina.

42:25.143 --> 42:28.611
       -Not a trust fund.
        -Some of us have
       to live in reality.

42:28.613 --> 42:31.548
     -It's not a trust fund.
     -Well, whatever it is.

42:31.550 --> 42:34.183
     It, it's barely enough
        to scrape by

42:34.185 --> 42:36.686
           and I mean,
     look at where we live.

42:36.688 --> 42:37.687
             Still.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.557
 Still what? I work my ass off.

42:44.629 --> 42:45.895
   Give me some of that wine.

42:47.232 --> 42:49.265
         -Are you sure?
             -Yeah.

42:49.267 --> 42:51.701
  It's OK to drink a little bit
     in the last few months.

42:51.703 --> 42:54.337
         [Karen sniffs]
      Just don't tell Don.

42:54.339 --> 42:56.606
   Your secret's safe with me.

42:58.877 --> 43:02.245
              -Hmm.
 -I'm so getting another bottle.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.350
 Don didn't wanna have the baby.

43:08.820 --> 43:12.121
    I mean not... now anyway.

43:16.194 --> 43:18.094
   So, why are you having it?

43:19.764 --> 43:20.763
             Pillow.

43:23.001 --> 43:24.734
 I didn't want to wait, I'm 42.

43:27.739 --> 43:29.272
 We were going to do it anyway.

43:30.642 --> 43:31.874
    He thinks I tricked him.

43:38.283 --> 43:40.917
            -Did you?
            -Sort of.

43:42.654 --> 43:44.821
     He's gonna be so happy
      when the baby's born.

43:46.691 --> 43:48.124
              Yeah.

43:48.126 --> 43:49.959
     Everything looks better
     at four in the morning

43:49.961 --> 43:51.728
       when you're staring
         into a diaper.

43:54.165 --> 43:55.698
      I think he's starting
           to hate me.

43:55.700 --> 43:57.000
 Does it seem like he hates me?

43:57.002 --> 43:58.267
          I don't know.

43:58.269 --> 43:59.902
      I think he hates me.

44:01.072 --> 44:02.905
       He really hates me!

44:02.907 --> 44:05.141
          [both laugh]

44:07.112 --> 44:08.911
   You were going to have kids
         anyway, right?

44:09.881 --> 44:12.148
  So? Who cares what he thinks.

44:12.150 --> 44:14.651
   You're doing what you want.

44:14.653 --> 44:17.220
             -Yeah.
   -You should be with Wayne.

44:17.222 --> 44:19.689
          [both laugh]

44:21.393 --> 44:23.660
       Did you see the way
     he was looking at you?

44:23.662 --> 44:25.161
               No.

44:25.163 --> 44:26.963
     I think he's developed
   like this pregnancy fetish.

44:26.965 --> 44:28.264
           It's gross.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.802
       -What's Kiki like?
              -Grr.

44:34.939 --> 44:39.709
   She's stupid in some ways,
 but she has some sort of theory
    behind that men love her.

44:40.345 --> 44:42.178
             Great.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.746
 Where the fuck are those guys?

44:48.286 --> 44:54.190
      -Oh, I have an idea.
        -No, don't stop.

45:04.202 --> 45:06.102
 No, I'm not playing that game.

45:06.104 --> 45:09.005
      -You love this game.
              -No.

45:09.007 --> 45:11.107
   You're curious about Wayne,
           I can tell.

45:12.911 --> 45:15.078
    You're curious about Don.
       That's what it is.

45:15.080 --> 45:16.979
             Ew. No.

45:16.981 --> 45:18.414
              Okay.

45:18.416 --> 45:20.750
             -Ready?
      -I'm a little rusty.

45:20.752 --> 45:22.285
              Set?

45:22.287 --> 45:23.319
              Draw.

45:27.092 --> 45:28.458
 What are you doing over there?

45:30.195 --> 45:32.995
       You're kind of like
      the DaVinci of dicks.

45:33.898 --> 45:35.798
 You just love drawing penises.

45:36.434 --> 45:39.202
       I think you do this
     when I'm not even here.

45:39.204 --> 45:42.238
        You miss drawing
      like this, don't you?

45:42.240 --> 45:43.906
            Admit it.

45:43.908 --> 45:47.076
   Do you remember that first
    uncircumcised one we did?

45:48.246 --> 45:50.947
       Or, I did. [laughs]

45:51.883 --> 45:56.285
        Who could forget.
     It was er, eye opening!

45:57.789 --> 46:00.456
         -[Tina laughs]
       -To say the least!

46:01.326 --> 46:03.092
      Okay, are you ready?

46:03.094 --> 46:04.127
            Hold on.

46:05.964 --> 46:07.997
            -Come on.
            -Hold on!

46:10.101 --> 46:12.135
     -It's gotta be perfect.
              -And.

46:12.137 --> 46:14.003
          Pencils down.

46:14.005 --> 46:15.138
           Okay, okay.

46:26.317 --> 46:29.118
    [Tina giggles and gasps]

46:29.120 --> 46:30.453
             Karen!

46:30.455 --> 46:32.221
        This is so good.

46:32.223 --> 46:36.793
      Look at the shading,
    there is so much feeling.

46:36.795 --> 46:38.494
         You always were
    a better artist than me.

46:38.496 --> 46:40.329
               No.

46:40.331 --> 46:42.365
         -Better drawer.
        -He's got a great
       little personality!

46:42.367 --> 46:44.400
        I like its crown.

46:44.402 --> 46:46.269
     That's not what I was--

46:46.271 --> 46:49.505
  I don't know what I was going
          for. [laughs]

46:49.507 --> 46:50.907
        I made it small,
    so you would feel better.

46:50.909 --> 46:52.208
    Oh, that was big of you.

46:53.144 --> 46:54.443
      Wayne's cute, right?

46:54.445 --> 46:56.245
      He's perfect for you.

46:56.247 --> 46:57.446
       I think he's cute.

46:57.448 --> 47:00.316
      -He's so principled.
              -Hmm.

47:05.223 --> 47:11.127
   I don't know, I think maybe
   Don is boning someone else.

47:13.832 --> 47:16.899
     A lot of guys hit on me
 when their wives were pregnant.

47:16.901 --> 47:18.401
     Oh, that's just great.

47:18.403 --> 47:20.203
 I am just saying, so you don't
       take it personally.

47:20.205 --> 47:22.438
        I think they feel
        scared or trapped

47:22.440 --> 47:25.541
     -or horny or whatever.
     -You're defending him?

47:25.543 --> 47:27.043
        I am just saying.

47:27.045 --> 47:28.344
          Do you think
      he seems like he is?

47:28.346 --> 47:30.546
       -How could I tell?
         -I don't know.

47:30.548 --> 47:32.114
          I hate this.

47:32.116 --> 47:33.549
       Have you asked him?

47:33.551 --> 47:36.285
     Not directly, just some
    nasty hints and comments.

47:36.287 --> 47:37.386
       OK, suppose he is?

47:38.990 --> 47:40.857
          -Do you care?
       -Of course I care.

47:40.859 --> 47:44.994
    OK, so then confront him
     or ask him or whatever.

47:44.996 --> 47:47.630
 Right, and end up a single mom
       out in the suburbs.

47:47.632 --> 47:50.132
          Online dating
      like Chrissy Shipman.

47:50.134 --> 47:51.901
      Who's Crissy Shipman?

47:51.903 --> 47:53.502
  You remember Chrissy Shipman,
     she lived on our floor.

47:53.504 --> 47:56.038
      Ew, you still keep up
        with that looser?

47:56.040 --> 47:57.940
       -Just on Facebook.
              -Uh.

47:59.143 --> 48:02.645
  Just name the baby after some

48:02.647 --> 48:04.881
    beloved relative of his.

48:04.883 --> 48:08.484
      What's some relative
       he's totally into?

48:08.486 --> 48:10.086
    His grandfather, I guess.

48:10.088 --> 48:13.923
 -What's his grandfather's name?
            -Elliot.

48:13.925 --> 48:18.661
 It, it's cute. Elliot, Elliot,
   Elliot. [says it like E.T.]

48:18.663 --> 48:20.329
        E.T. phone home.

48:20.331 --> 48:22.265
          [Tina laughs]

48:22.267 --> 48:24.033
I would never have thought that.

48:25.203 --> 48:26.369
     No, it's really sweet.

48:26.371 --> 48:28.070
      Name the baby Elliot,

48:28.072 --> 48:30.339
  you will lock him in for life
         with that one.

48:31.309 --> 48:32.341
      [elevator door opens]

48:32.343 --> 48:33.943
     Oh my god, that's them.

48:33.945 --> 48:36.279
 -Oh, do you have any mouthwash?
          -Yeah, come.

48:38.650 --> 48:41.250
          [jolly music]

48:55.199 --> 48:58.167
       Don't ask Don about
 him fooling around, I know you.

48:58.169 --> 48:59.669
        Don't tell Wayne
       I'm still smoking.

48:59.671 --> 49:01.304
 Don't tell Don I was drinking.

49:02.307 --> 49:03.372
           [giggling]

49:11.082 --> 49:14.183
    [Kiki] I said wait, wait,
      he has brain cancer?

49:14.185 --> 49:18.087
  And they were like, no, Kiki,
      he is a break dancer.

49:18.089 --> 49:19.488
           [laughing]

49:20.525 --> 49:24.994
   I can't believe, I mean...

49:24.996 --> 49:27.229
        That's fantastic.
     Here, let me help you.

49:27.231 --> 49:29.432
        -Oh my god, yeah.
           -I can see
     why you guys chose her.

49:29.434 --> 49:31.033
          -Oh, shut up.
             -Voilà.

49:31.035 --> 49:32.735
          I'll get you
      something to put on.

49:32.737 --> 49:35.037
          Hi, I'm Kiki.

49:35.039 --> 49:36.973
      I'm Wayne and Tina's
       baby surrogate mom.

49:36.975 --> 49:38.474
          -And you are?
           -I'm Karen.

49:38.476 --> 49:40.743
  -You're pregnant too, right?
    -Oh no, I'm not pregnant.

49:42.380 --> 49:44.113
          I'm kidding.

49:44.115 --> 49:46.048
          Oh god, good.

49:46.050 --> 49:49.051
It's always so horrible when you
ask someone if they're pregnant,

49:49.053 --> 49:52.288
   and then it just turns out
that they're just you know, fat.

49:52.290 --> 49:54.323
 Oh well, I'm pregnant and fat.

49:54.325 --> 49:57.393
       Oh god, no, no, no,
   I didn't mean that you're--

49:57.395 --> 50:00.463
      Er, sorry. No, I mean
   obviously you're pregnant.

50:00.465 --> 50:02.064
   Doesn't she look wonderful?

50:02.066 --> 50:04.667
Yeah, you have such rosy cheeks.

50:04.669 --> 50:05.668
              Here.

50:06.537 --> 50:08.337
         Oh, thank you.

50:14.545 --> 50:17.480
             -Ahem.
       -So who's winning?

50:17.482 --> 50:20.583
       Er, Mets. Mets won.

50:22.620 --> 50:24.220
       Were you drinking?

50:24.222 --> 50:25.688
              -No.
            -So uh--

50:25.690 --> 50:27.156
 How do you two know each other?

50:27.158 --> 50:30.259
         -We're married.
    -Oh, I was just kidding.

50:30.261 --> 50:31.527
         You better not
       have been drinking.

50:31.529 --> 50:33.095
    It is really, really bad.

50:33.097 --> 50:35.264
    Oh, I'm aware, thank you.

50:35.266 --> 50:37.133
  Don't get around your friend
    and start fucking around.

50:40.438 --> 50:41.437
              God.

50:42.373 --> 50:44.407
    It is like really weird.

50:44.409 --> 50:46.409
        I always thought
  it would be the hardest thing
       to give up alcohol.

50:46.411 --> 50:48.677
  But I don't even wanna drink.

50:48.679 --> 50:51.747
  It's like all I'm craving is,
          is fresh air.

50:51.749 --> 50:54.717
          Fresh fruits
      and fresh vegetables.

50:54.719 --> 50:58.287
        -You seem better.
        -I am, thank you.

50:58.289 --> 51:00.556
   So how many months are you?

51:00.558 --> 51:01.524
               16.

51:01.526 --> 51:04.493
          Wow! [laughs]

51:04.495 --> 51:09.331
  Were you like, so hot all the
 time in your first few months?

51:09.333 --> 51:11.233
          I don't think
      I was hot, actually.

51:11.235 --> 51:12.802
             Really?

51:12.804 --> 51:15.638
  Well, were your breasts like
        really sensitive?

51:15.640 --> 51:21.310
     Because my breasts are
 like so sensitive all the time.

51:21.312 --> 51:24.513
      -And I am so thirsty.
  -I, I'll get you some water.

51:24.515 --> 51:27.550
 Oh, no, no, hey, just, you sit.

51:29.420 --> 51:32.755
  Kiki has not had any morning
sickness at all, which is great.

51:32.757 --> 51:34.723
    What did she tell Clark?

51:34.725 --> 51:37.426
        Oh, I don't know,
     we didn't get into it.

51:37.428 --> 51:38.761
        The game was on.

51:38.763 --> 51:40.863
         Plus we stopped
        at a tapas place.

51:40.865 --> 51:42.364
           Thank you.

51:42.366 --> 51:47.269
     I'm sorry, you stopped
        at a tapas place?

51:47.271 --> 51:50.272
         She was hungry,
      she wanted to unwind.

51:53.478 --> 51:55.711
 I'm really sorry to be breaking
    up your party like this.

51:56.848 --> 51:58.481
 Why are you apologizing to me?

51:58.483 --> 52:00.816
     Mm, uhm, I don't know.

52:01.819 --> 52:05.121
           -I'm sorry.
           -It's fine.

52:05.123 --> 52:06.889
             -Relax.
          -Oh, thanks.

52:06.891 --> 52:09.391
       So, what happened?

52:09.393 --> 52:11.527
            Mm... mm.

52:13.764 --> 52:16.565
    Clarks wife is pregnant.

52:16.567 --> 52:18.801
           What again?
     What is that like six?

52:18.803 --> 52:21.770
    Yeah, I mean he is never
       going to leave her.

52:21.772 --> 52:24.340
       Ever. So I told him
       that I was pregnant

52:24.342 --> 52:26.475
  and now he wants to leave me.

52:26.477 --> 52:29.345
 You know, I'm like really hot.
          I can't like
   deal with this, I'm sorry.

52:29.347 --> 52:31.347
   Wait, why did you tell him?

52:31.349 --> 52:33.415
      Uh, I had to because

52:33.417 --> 52:35.551
   when he heard that she was
  pregnant, he needed to see me

52:35.553 --> 52:37.686
  and then when he saw my belly
       he could just tell.

52:37.688 --> 52:39.522
          -What belly?
       -He saw your belly?

52:39.524 --> 52:41.524
  He said it was the stupidest
   thing that I've ever done.

52:41.526 --> 52:42.892
       [Don] Who's Clark?

52:42.894 --> 52:45.327
  [Kiki] Clark and I have been
        in a relationship

52:45.329 --> 52:47.396
     for five stupid years.

52:47.398 --> 52:49.632
       -And he's married?
              -Yes.

52:49.634 --> 52:53.369
    [Don] And he doesn't know
 anything about your arrangement
         with these two?

52:53.371 --> 52:56.639
              -No!
        -[Don] I love it.

52:56.641 --> 53:01.243
 -[Kiki] You know what? He said
the worst possible things to me.
       -[Wayne] Like what?

53:01.946 --> 53:04.413
  Like you've got better things
      to do with your life.

53:04.415 --> 53:07.249
 And I was like what? Sit around
  with my looks disintegrating

53:07.251 --> 53:10.586
 waiting for you to divorce that
  preppy little witch you hate?

53:10.588 --> 53:12.188
         [sniffs] Jesus.

53:12.190 --> 53:15.658
      [Kiki] Oh, oh my god
          I'm so sorry.

53:15.660 --> 53:17.193
         Oh, it's okay.

53:17.195 --> 53:18.961
   Oh my god, I'm gonna be OK.

53:19.864 --> 53:22.631
     Oh god, I am so sorry.

53:22.633 --> 53:25.201
It's fine. Don't worry about it,
     she cries all the time.

53:25.203 --> 53:26.936
       -Cause You stay out
          all the time.
       -You got her drunk.

53:26.938 --> 53:28.437
           Arrest me.

53:28.439 --> 53:30.806
          I am the one
      who should be crying.

53:30.808 --> 53:32.675
   She's got a man and a baby.

53:32.677 --> 53:36.946
  And I have no man and I have
   like a timeshare in a baby.

53:36.948 --> 53:40.349
     I'm sure you and Clark
        will work it out.

53:40.351 --> 53:41.617
   Why should she work it out?

53:41.619 --> 53:43.619
          -He's a jerk.
         -She loves him.

53:43.621 --> 53:45.988
         -He's married.
    -She likes married guys.

53:45.990 --> 53:47.623
   I'm almost passed my prime.

53:47.625 --> 53:50.726
       No you are a young,
        beautiful woman.

53:50.728 --> 53:52.628
       I am in phase four.

53:52.630 --> 53:54.396
         Oh, you're not
      in phase four, Kiki.

53:54.398 --> 53:56.498
           -Four what?
         -Er Kiki, Kiki

53:56.500 --> 53:59.935
    has these theories about
  the phases of a woman's life.

53:59.937 --> 54:02.571
      -Go ahead, tell them.
           -No listen,
     I don't wanna bore you.

54:02.573 --> 54:04.974
         No, not at all.

54:06.978 --> 54:09.411
              Okay.

54:09.413 --> 54:11.780
      There are five phases
       of a woman's life.

54:11.782 --> 54:14.316
   And the first is girlhood.

54:14.318 --> 54:17.720
      Like learning what's
        expected of you.
     You know, what's sexy.

54:17.722 --> 54:20.389
   And incidentally I realized
 this is where most young women

54:20.391 --> 54:22.625
         plant the seeds
   for their second marriages

54:22.627 --> 54:24.927
    by like sitting on their
     fathers' friends' laps

54:24.929 --> 54:26.362
      -and stuff like that.
             -Nice.

54:26.364 --> 54:28.831
       Yeah. And phase two

54:28.833 --> 54:31.333
     is when you grow boobs.

54:31.335 --> 54:33.836
      And men of all ages,
   they start to look at them.

54:33.838 --> 54:36.772
         And you know it
        and they know it.

54:36.774 --> 54:40.509
But everyone around you pretends
  like it's like not happening.

54:40.511 --> 54:44.380
     And this is when women
      are actually in their
         fullest power.

54:44.382 --> 54:46.582
   -Yeah, I'm nervous as a cat
      around teenage girls.
              -See.

54:46.584 --> 54:48.484
          -Yeah they're
     very intimidating, Don.
              -See?

54:48.486 --> 54:49.952
           Are you OK?

54:50.788 --> 54:51.854
        [Karen] I'm fine.

54:51.856 --> 54:58.360
  Um, Kiki was just telling us
about her theory of the phases
       of a woman's life.

54:58.362 --> 54:59.895
             Great.

54:59.897 --> 55:01.597
        Phase three

55:01.599 --> 55:02.698
   is when you're in your 20's

55:02.700 --> 55:04.900
 and your like very early 30's,

55:04.902 --> 55:06.068
    and you have to be smart

55:06.070 --> 55:08.070
         and supportive.

55:08.072 --> 55:11.607
     And you have to like be
      a really good partner
          for your man.

55:11.609 --> 55:14.843
 Oh, and you have to have a man
         in phase three.

55:14.845 --> 55:18.013
And you have to stay sexy enough
   so it keeps him challenged

55:18.015 --> 55:20.916
        -and interested.
  -Ow! You're squeezing my hand
            too hard.

55:20.918 --> 55:24.086
             -Sorry.
   -And you also have to like
        follow him around

55:24.088 --> 55:26.322
  anywhere so he'll marry you.

55:26.324 --> 55:27.523
              Wow.

55:27.525 --> 55:29.525
       And that brings us
         to phase four.

55:29.527 --> 55:30.859
       Which is my phase.

55:30.861 --> 55:32.695
   -You are not in phase four.
          -Phase four.

55:33.964 --> 55:36.765
    You have to be a mother.

55:36.767 --> 55:39.868
You see once women turn 30, they
  like start to look like shit.

55:39.870 --> 55:41.937
         And their faces
      get all like coarse.

55:41.939 --> 55:44.740
 And their teeth get all stained
 from all that partying they did

55:44.742 --> 55:47.343
      supporting their man
         in phase three.

55:47.345 --> 55:50.546
    And their cleavage starts
    to get like chicken skin

55:50.548 --> 55:52.014
         and disgusting.

55:52.016 --> 55:56.018
    And nobody wants to look
directly at women in phase four.

55:56.020 --> 56:00.389
      I mean, particularly
    like in the later stages
     of it. I mean, I don't.

56:00.391 --> 56:04.860
     I don't. I have to make
     like a concerted effort
        to look at them.

56:04.862 --> 56:08.063
   We all do, it's depressing.

56:09.066 --> 56:13.702
  We only need phase four women
       as mother figures.

56:13.704 --> 56:16.705
 As like therapists and mentors

56:16.707 --> 56:19.141
   and we need them for their
      business connections

56:19.143 --> 56:22.478
  and their social connections,
   and we need them to give us
like their cool vintage clothing

56:22.480 --> 56:24.079
         that they can't
        fit into anymore.

56:26.384 --> 56:28.851
    Clark already has someone
         in phase four.

56:29.954 --> 56:31.620
       He doesn't need me.

56:35.693 --> 56:37.426
     I was his little vixen.

56:38.896 --> 56:41.997
   And now that I'm pregnant,
    I'm not a vixen anymore.

56:46.637 --> 56:49.505
    Oh my god, I feel so fat!

56:49.507 --> 56:53.041
       [sobs] I'm like hot
         and disgusting.

56:53.043 --> 56:54.143
             [sighs]

56:56.514 --> 56:58.080
    I'm still a vixen inside.

56:59.150 --> 57:00.716
            I'm not.

57:00.718 --> 57:03.986
       -I am not a vixen.
         -Yeah, you are.

57:03.988 --> 57:06.622
      You are both vixens.

57:06.624 --> 57:08.657
     No I'm not, look at me.

57:08.659 --> 57:12.161
 Oh my god, I can't keep having
   this conversation with you.

57:12.163 --> 57:14.730
    Every day she wants me to
  tell her she looks beautiful,

57:14.732 --> 57:17.132
        and the truth is
      she's looked better.

57:17.134 --> 57:18.767
       And she will again.

57:19.870 --> 57:22.938
        -What if I don't?
     -[chuckles] You better.

57:24.175 --> 57:26.909
     Hey, you are luminous.

57:26.911 --> 57:30.479
        -Give it a rest.
 -All I want is to have a baby.

57:32.116 --> 57:33.849
    And I wanna get married.

57:34.852 --> 57:36.585
      Why is that so hard?

57:37.922 --> 57:41.190
   Oh, and I have to move out
        of the apartment.

57:41.192 --> 57:42.724
        Why? Does he pay
       for the apartment?

57:42.726 --> 57:45.694
  Oh, I think that's personal.
           Don't you?

57:46.564 --> 57:51.133
 -Oh yeah, certainly, I'm sorry.
     -No, like, don't even--

57:51.135 --> 57:53.702
      [Kiki's phone rings]
       Oh shit. I'm sorry.

57:54.638 --> 57:55.904
             [sighs]

58:01.011 --> 58:02.010
              Yeah.

58:03.581 --> 58:07.850
    Oh, oh god, I'm so sorry.
       Where should I be?

58:07.852 --> 58:09.785
        -Is that him?
              -Um,

58:09.787 --> 58:11.753
          well actually
       I'm with people who
    care about me, right now.

58:12.923 --> 58:14.857
   Yeah, uh-huh, that's right.

58:15.759 --> 58:17.926
       [Indistinct reply]

58:17.928 --> 58:19.661
   You know what? You can just
    like, go fuck yourself!

58:19.663 --> 58:22.698
  I'm gonna hang up right now!
             [sighs]

58:22.700 --> 58:24.099
 If you don't wanna talk to him,

58:24.101 --> 58:25.901
     why don't you turn off
           your phone?

58:25.903 --> 58:27.903
   Um, I don't know, I should.

58:27.905 --> 58:30.105
        -We should leave.
       -No, god no, okay.

58:30.107 --> 58:33.108
   I'm sorry. You know what? I
 don't wanna mess up your party.

58:33.110 --> 58:34.910
         -I'm gonna go.
    -[both men] No, don't go!

58:36.180 --> 58:37.679
              -OK?
              -OK.

58:38.649 --> 58:41.984
    -What did he want?
         -Um, I guess...

58:41.986 --> 58:44.019
       I guess he wants me
    to change my mind.

58:44.021 --> 58:46.922
      -What does that mean?
  -What do you think it means?

58:46.924 --> 58:48.156
       Oh, absolutely not!

58:48.158 --> 58:49.858
     Hey! Don't yell at me.

58:49.860 --> 58:51.860
        I'm not yelling,
        I'm just adamant.

58:51.862 --> 58:54.162
        -This is our kid
   we're talking about, Kiki.
            -I know.

58:54.164 --> 58:55.731
        Is that something
       you're considering?

58:55.733 --> 58:57.533
              -No.
         -Are you sure?

58:57.535 --> 59:00.235
             -Yeah.
        -I mean, you want
       to do this, right?

59:00.237 --> 59:02.538
  -This is something you want?
              -Yes.

59:02.540 --> 59:03.939
      I wanna have a baby.

59:03.941 --> 59:05.173
            OK, then.

59:06.544 --> 59:07.576
            Sort of.

59:08.779 --> 59:10.312
       I mean, oh my god.

59:10.314 --> 59:12.214
        How did I mess up
         my life so bad?

59:13.851 --> 59:16.218
       I think I just have
       too much integrity.

59:16.220 --> 59:18.053
              -Huh.
     -All of my friends said

59:18.055 --> 59:19.154
          I should have
      just gotten pregnant

59:19.156 --> 59:20.622
 when I was first seeing Clark.

59:20.624 --> 59:22.658
   All of my friends said it.

59:22.660 --> 59:24.259
       Within three months
          I should have
  just gotten like knocked up,

59:24.261 --> 59:27.062
   while he was so vulnerable,
            you know?

59:27.064 --> 59:28.997
   While he was dying for me.

59:28.999 --> 59:32.334
      -I've ruined my life.
      -This guy sounds like
        a total asshole.

59:32.336 --> 59:36.138
 He's not. You don't even know,
      his wife is horrible.

59:36.140 --> 59:38.774
   He doesn't even want kids,
         but every time
     he's about to leave her

59:38.776 --> 59:40.108
       she gets pregnant!

59:40.110 --> 59:43.278
           -Magically.
  -Oh, she does it on purpose!

59:43.280 --> 59:45.681
   She doesn't even love him.
    It's like she hates him.

59:45.683 --> 59:47.583
        All she ever does
         is yell at him.

59:47.585 --> 59:50.118
       He's just too good
     of a guy to leave her.

59:50.120 --> 59:53.288
   He's like this noble person

59:53.290 --> 59:56.058
      who has been trapped
     by this horrible woman

59:56.060 --> 59:59.661
        who keeps having
      his children and then
    turning them against him.

59:59.663 --> 01:00:02.331
        -He married her.
   -Because she was pregnant.

01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:05.667
      I mean, people never
     have sympathy for men.

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:09.371
   And he has another ex-wife
      who has been sponging
      off of him for years.

01:00:09.373 --> 01:00:11.974
            -He does?
-And she'll never get re-married
    because she wants to keep

01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:13.375
    getting alimony from him.

01:00:13.377 --> 01:00:15.811
    See divorce laws in this
     country are outrageous,

01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:17.813
    that's what needs reform.

01:00:17.815 --> 01:00:19.781
   -I feel a little bit sick.
    -Do you want some water?

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:21.717
              -No.
           -okay then.

01:00:21.719 --> 01:00:24.886
        Why can't I ever
     just have what I want?

01:00:24.888 --> 01:00:27.789
        No one ever wants
   to be with me for forever.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.825
      Just on the weekdays.

01:00:31.095 --> 01:00:32.694
      What's wrong with me?

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:42.938
          [Kiki laughs]

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:45.173
      [the women all laugh]

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:52.381
     Oh my god, I love this!

01:00:54.785 --> 01:00:57.185
     It's perfect, it looks
   like he got a little crown.

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:01.957
  -What's this supposed to be?
           -Give me...

01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:02.858
          Is that you?

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.060
      Woah, okay this one--

01:01:05.062 --> 01:01:08.196
             -Whoa!
           -[laughing]

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:10.432
 -Oh my god, did you draw this?
       -She made me do it.

01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:13.335
         -It's something
       that we used to do.
-C'mon let's, let's have a look.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:16.672
       -Come on, come on.
  -Oh my god, that looks great.

01:01:16.674 --> 01:01:18.740
       -What's this? Huh?
             -What?

01:01:18.742 --> 01:01:20.409
      What yeah, I'm sorry.

01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:23.245
   Maybe you should show Kiki
 your penis, so everyone knows.

01:01:23.247 --> 01:01:25.714
           -[laughing]
     -Yeah, maybe I should!

01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:28.216
        -OK kids, please.
    -I just don't understand
       why you would draw

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:30.686
        this unflattering
     rendition of my penis?

01:01:30.688 --> 01:01:33.121
     -Why would you do that?
       -She actually said
    it didn't do you justice.

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:35.724
           -Thank you.
    -You are quite an artist.

01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:37.259
     Am I too female, Tina?

01:01:37.261 --> 01:01:39.161
 Yeah, you know what? Maybe you
    should wear an undershirt

01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:40.829
 and like beat me or something.

01:01:40.831 --> 01:01:42.431
         Maybe I should

01:01:42.433 --> 01:01:45.233
   since you made me wear this
stupid shirt in the first place.

01:01:45.235 --> 01:01:46.968
        Oh, super macho!

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:49.237
        I'd like to amend
      my drawing, if I may.

01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:51.006
    -Wayne, it's just a game.
              -No!

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:53.408
     What is wrong with you?
  Why are you acting like this?

01:01:54.812 --> 01:01:56.044
     How should I be acting?

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:57.879
     Since it's up you, huh?

01:01:57.881 --> 01:01:59.247
  I act the way you want me to

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:01.383
         and you draw me
      with a one inch cock!

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:03.085
       It's not one inch!

01:02:03.087 --> 01:02:05.954
      We didn't even really
   determine the scale, Wayne.

01:02:05.956 --> 01:02:07.355
    Well, you figured it out.

01:02:07.357 --> 01:02:09.191
        You know, I think
  what Wayne is trying to say--

01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:10.959
  I don't really care what you
  think Wayne is trying to say.

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:13.428
   Don't tell her what to care
   about what someone thinks.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.130
             -what?
             -What?

01:02:15.132 --> 01:02:17.866
      Kiki, have the baby,
     Wayne, change the baby!

01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:20.335
        But Tina goes off
        on her merry way

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:22.037
         doing whatever
       she wants, because

01:02:22.039 --> 01:02:23.271
      the only thing that's
important in the world right now

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:24.940
      is what's Tina wants.

01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:26.508
  -I'm getting a stomach ache.
       -Don, should we go?

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:28.176
        No, no, no, shh.

01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:30.245
  I didn't do this whole thing
    so you could turn around

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:31.480
       and persecute Kiki.

01:02:31.482 --> 01:02:33.081
   How am I persecuting Kiki?

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.883
    You're treating her like
     a second class citizen.

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:37.352
      Oh, suddenly she has
     her crotch in your face

01:02:37.354 --> 01:02:39.154
    and I'm persecuting her?

01:02:39.156 --> 01:02:41.089
     She's not an idiot, she
 knows exactly what she's doing.

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:42.791
 Put the fucking sweat pants on.

01:02:42.793 --> 01:02:44.226
          Uh-hu, do not
     talk to her like that!

01:02:44.228 --> 01:02:45.761
     Hmm. That's the mother
         of your child.

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:47.195
 You can mind your own business.

01:02:47.197 --> 01:02:48.964
      Too much male energy
   in the room for you, Tina?

01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:50.532
      -Oh, is that how you
      describe the energy?
             -Yeah.

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:52.834
        OK, I gotta pee.

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:01.476
        -It's time to go.
              -OK.

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:16.792
        You got something
      on your dress there.

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:22.964
   You know what they used to
      call women like you?

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:24.366
           What, Don?

01:03:25.803 --> 01:03:26.868
            Witches.

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:30.972
 Yeah. Women like me have always
      scared men like you.

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:32.107
       You don't scare me.

01:03:32.943 --> 01:03:35.310
           Yeah, I do.

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:39.014
   It seems somethings growing
       between these two.

01:03:39.016 --> 01:03:41.349
           No, sorry.

01:03:41.351 --> 01:03:46.421
      Something between us
      has grown inside her.

01:03:46.423 --> 01:03:48.857
     Huh, that's very good.
     You like playing games.

01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:50.325
   You get off on power games?

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:54.896
         I think this is
     a very interesting game
   you're playing right here.

01:03:56.133 --> 01:03:59.367
Kiki, you've been kicked out
    of your apartment, right?

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:02.103
             -Yeah.
   -Hmm, maybe I can help you.

01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:05.440
              -Don.
    -I just bought a building
       in the East Village

01:04:05.442 --> 01:04:08.410
       and there's a rent
      stabilized apartment.

01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:10.345
   We just evicted the tenant.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:12.113
    Was it an elderly person?

01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:14.449
      What about I put you
          on the lease?

01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:17.185
     -What would that mean?
    -That would mean you have
   a rent stabilized apartment

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:18.587
       in the East Village
    for the rest of your life

01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:21.223
     for about $415 a month.

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:24.292
           Oh my god!

01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:26.228
             -Wait.
  -Would that change anything?

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:29.331
       -Ha, ha, oh my god.
          -[Karen] Don.

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:31.900
      We're not giving Kiki
          an apartment.

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:33.535
    No, I'm not talking about
       giving it to Kiki.

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:37.172
        I'm talking about
       giving it to Wayne.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.244
Wayne doesn't need an apartment.

01:04:42.246 --> 01:04:46.481
      If that would change
 anything in this... Situation.

01:04:46.483 --> 01:04:48.250
           No, thanks.

01:04:48.252 --> 01:04:51.419
    I'm offering it to Wayne.

01:04:53.357 --> 01:04:56.024
     -Why would you do that?
  -Well, I need a project too.

01:04:58.195 --> 01:04:59.527
        He doesn't want--

01:05:01.632 --> 01:05:04.466
     -Does it have a washer
          and a dryer?
       -There's a hook up.

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:11.373
I think we should talk about it.

01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:14.009
         [Wayne] I mean
     it's a generous offer.

01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:15.510
          Are you high?

01:05:15.512 --> 01:05:17.445
     I mean if you two don't
    have a legal agreement

01:05:17.447 --> 01:05:19.547
   -and Kiki is the mother...
          -It's my egg.

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:22.150
     -You don't really have
       a legal agreement.
    -Wayne and I are married.

01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:23.685
   By a drunk guy in Thailand.

01:05:23.687 --> 01:05:25.553
           -It's Fiji
    -By a drunk guy in Fiji.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:29.257
 I mean just in case legal is a
moral code you're interested in.

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:33.261
  Kiki has my baby inside her.

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:34.696
         Our, our baby.

01:05:34.698 --> 01:05:37.299
And I'm feeling all these primal

01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:40.035
         feelings arise
  unexpectantly very powerful.

01:05:40.037 --> 01:05:41.369
          I didn't know
    I was going to feel so--

01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:42.704
            -Primal?
             -Yeah!

01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:45.073
        Yeah, primal.

01:05:45.075 --> 01:05:47.375
  -Great, so you finally muster
 this primal male feeling and--
           -And what?

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:50.145
  I, I don't know what, Wayne?

01:05:50.147 --> 01:05:52.280
             -What?
  -I don't know, I don't know.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.416
   Well, spit it out, because
    you've got a sweet offer
    on the table, right, Don?

01:05:54.418 --> 01:05:56.484
             -Right.
        -You know, Tina.

01:05:56.486 --> 01:06:00.121
 It is a basic feminine instinct

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:02.123
     that's lacking in you.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:05.427
   Really, what basic feminine
instinct am I lacking this week?

01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:06.728
           -Nurturing.
         -[Tina scoffs]

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:08.630
       -I hate that word!
           -I love it.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.133
        She's nurturing?

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:14.002
She's a fucking train wreck.

01:06:14.004 --> 01:06:15.136
           Excuse me?

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:17.472
     -She's having my baby.
              -Our!

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.374
            Our baby!

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:20.742
           -Whatever.
       -I'm not nurturing?

01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:23.278
    All I do is nurture you.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.580
            I support
     your meandering career.

01:06:25.582 --> 01:06:29.517
      I pay for this place,
     I'm so fucking sick of
    nurturing, I could puke!

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:33.421
       -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
           -I floated
    your fucking magazine.

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:35.657
   You don't float it anymore.
         You ditched it!

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:39.260
       Because we started
      a new project, Wayne!

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:43.164
        You know, there's
     a photograph in a book.

01:06:44.134 --> 01:06:49.004
       A family of women.
 A woman riding a bike pregnant.

01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:51.172
The wind blowing in her hair.

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:53.108
     Wearing denim overalls.

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:56.011
   The expression on her face.

01:06:56.013 --> 01:06:57.312
           Simple joy.

01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.247
       That's what I want.

01:06:59.249 --> 01:07:02.150
      -A pair of overalls?
              -No.

01:07:05.055 --> 01:07:07.222
           Simple joy.

01:07:08.492 --> 01:07:10.792
     It's not simple, Wayne.

01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:12.494
     It is for some people.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:18.466
           [Tina] OK.

01:07:19.403 --> 01:07:21.302
I'm gonna make it really simple.

01:07:23.173 --> 01:07:25.440
      Are you banging her?

01:07:27.277 --> 01:07:28.309
               No.

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:30.745
           -OK, then.
            -But I--

01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:32.814
            But what?
   What are you trying to say?

01:07:32.816 --> 01:07:36.551
        I, I don't know.
        Stop pushing me.

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:38.820
  I just don't want to miss out
    on something vital.

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:42.424
        Something vital?
  You and I, this isn't vital?

01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:45.126
      No, you are no longer
     vital to the equation.

01:07:45.128 --> 01:07:47.729
-You're-- you didn't want to be.
        -We're not vital?

01:07:47.731 --> 01:07:51.066
       That was the whole
        fuckin plan or--

01:07:51.068 --> 01:07:53.134
    Or was I just the bread--
           Oh my god.

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:56.104
             [sighs]
     Did you guys plan this,
   was this some kind of plan?

01:07:56.106 --> 01:07:58.306
      -You know we didn't.
 -I don't know anything anymore.

01:07:58.308 --> 01:08:01.209
 -How are guys gonna make money?
     -Maybe you can provide
         child support.

01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:02.510
   You're having an abortion.

01:08:02.512 --> 01:08:04.746
          -No, I'm not.
         -Yes, you are.

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:07.115
 -She's not having an abortion.
     -We'll see about that.

01:08:07.117 --> 01:08:09.551
        -Not unless Clark
    and I get back together.
          -You're not!

01:08:09.553 --> 01:08:13.555
       You're incredible.
  This is what you choose after
  all you're high moral ground?

01:08:13.557 --> 01:08:17.559
  You choose a rescue mission,
 the power of a powerless woman

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.794
       no man can resist.
    Were you ever a stripper?

01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:21.261
       So what if she was?

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:22.697
          -[Tina sighs]
      -You didn't love me!

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.165
You married me for tax purposes.

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:25.466
       Don't be an idiot.

01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:27.167
    You didn't want my baby.

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:28.502
      You killed my child!

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:31.473
        -This again, no.
  -Yes, this again. I'm sorry!

01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:33.741
      You can't agree to it
   and then hold it against me

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:35.310
   for the rest of our lives.

01:08:35.312 --> 01:08:37.812
    I can't help how I feel!

01:08:37.814 --> 01:08:41.316
  -After you did what you did.
           -We did it.

01:08:41.318 --> 01:08:44.285
 You did it! It was your choice,
      I went along with it.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:46.621
       It was your choice.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:49.224
  I wanna feel the kind of love
       people talk about.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.292
            -Me too.
   -I don't wanna think about
      myself all the time.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:53.761
            -Me too.
   -I want to be with a woman

01:08:53.763 --> 01:08:56.631
who doesn't think having my baby
      is ruining her life.

01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:58.265
 Or one that just won't say it?

01:08:58.268 --> 01:09:00.902
    You want a liar, you want
     a manipulative coward?

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.737
       That's, that's what
    you think about mothers.

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:04.439
       You'd be surprised.

01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:06.174
            All night
   you've been attacking her.

01:09:06.176 --> 01:09:09.144
              -Her?
      -And Kiki and anyone
       who makes choices,

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.578
    choices you don't happen
         to agree with.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:13.814
   Because they are miserable
    and they won't admit it!

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:15.649
          She's joyous!

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:18.185
         -She's serene!
    -You wanna look at Karen.

01:09:18.188 --> 01:09:20.522
        First time since
      Kiki walked in, but--

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:22.223
      You know what, okay.

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:24.759
             -Tina!
       -This is your idea
       of a happy couple?

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:27.495
      A perfect situation?

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:33.734
           I am happy.

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.742
        Ugh! Huh-huh-huh!

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:46.848
               OK.

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:50.551
      I'm sick of everyone
     pretending to be happy.

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:54.822
  Everyone on drugs, pretending
        everything's fine
      and buying big houses

01:09:54.824 --> 01:09:57.559
  to get away from each other,
   having kids 'cause they've
       run out of friends

01:09:57.561 --> 01:10:00.695
   having these fucking little
   accessories who are excuses

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.864
       for every fucked up
        choice they make.

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:07.435
        And they are just
       gonna grow up to be
   more people I fucking hate!

01:10:07.437 --> 01:10:10.538
  Those are your words, Wayne.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.974
 I don't feel like that anymore.

01:10:12.976 --> 01:10:16.444
  I'm allowed to change, Tina.

01:10:17.747 --> 01:10:19.881
             OK, OK.

01:10:21.585 --> 01:10:23.451
          You're happy?

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:26.788
              Yes.

01:10:31.695 --> 01:10:34.729
            -Really?
              -Yes.

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:41.703
          We're happy.
  You're the one who's unhappy.

01:10:41.705 --> 01:10:43.771
So everyone's happy except me?

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:45.673
         -Looks like it.
           -I'm happy!

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:48.543
        I mean as long as
    I can get the apartment.

01:10:50.814 --> 01:10:52.680
           This sucks!

01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:57.785
 After everything I did for you.

01:10:57.787 --> 01:11:00.922
     I-- I did this for you.

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:05.660
  And I let her into our lives
        so you could have
        what you wanted.

01:11:05.662 --> 01:11:08.563
     'Cause that's how much
      I love you, bonehead.

01:11:08.565 --> 01:11:11.833
     I don't even understand
         what you want.

01:11:11.835 --> 01:11:14.702
        It's all theories
     and semantics with you.

01:11:14.704 --> 01:11:16.437
       You want equality.

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:18.806
   You wanna change the world,
    you want social justice,

01:11:18.808 --> 01:11:22.477
     you want all this crap
 I don't even remember anymore.

01:11:22.479 --> 01:11:26.014
     When did social justice
       become crap to you?

01:11:26.883 --> 01:11:30.852
  You sound like you joined the
   pod-people. Wayne, come on.

01:11:35.058 --> 01:11:39.427
  -Maybe this is what you want.
              -No.

01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:43.364
         -You can visit.
         -[Tina laughs]

01:11:43.366 --> 01:11:45.533
 You can still do your project.

01:11:45.535 --> 01:11:50.538
      It might be good for
  your project. And, hey, hey.

01:11:51.608 --> 01:11:54.342
     You're gonna do so many
     amazing things in life.

01:11:54.344 --> 01:11:55.943
        And I'm not gonna
       stand in your way.

01:12:09.793 --> 01:12:10.925
           [Tina sobs]

01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:32.680
Well, this has been interesting.

01:12:35.385 --> 01:12:37.051
        -Are we leaving?
             -Yeah.

01:12:58.441 --> 01:12:59.941
       We'll be in touch.

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:06.748
     [Karen] Can I hug you?

01:13:09.519 --> 01:13:11.919
          [piano music]

01:13:37.547 --> 01:13:41.082
    Send a picture of Elliot
         when he's born.

01:13:42.719 --> 01:13:44.452
             Elliot?

01:13:53.863 --> 01:13:55.930
      It was super awesome
        meeting you guys.

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:15.950
    I'm gonna take Kiki home.

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:18.586
       [melancholic music]

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:03.564
  I forgot-- I forgot the bike.

01:15:04.234 --> 01:15:06.501
      [melancholic music]

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:17.278
           I'm sorry.

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:20.234
    [laughter and chattering]

01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:21.969
     [Tina] Hi, what are you
           doing here?

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:24.739
  [Karen] Oh my god, I haven't
     seen you in so long....

01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:26.807
          [piano music]

01:17:30.113 --> 01:17:32.179
          [chattering]

01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:56.070
             [song]
