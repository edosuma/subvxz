JAKARTA, INDONESIA
SEPTEMBER 24th, 2003

01:44.549 --> 01:47.135
KEMENTERIAN KESEHATAN
REPUBLIK INDONESIA

10:08.636 --> 10:12.098
THE LAST OF US

10:56.225 --> 10:57.768
Morning.

11:11.199 --> 11:14.118
- Do I look like I'm infected?
- Show us your arm.

11:22.001 --> 11:24.337
Yeah, it's not getting any worse, is it?

11:27.215 --> 11:29.592
If we're out in the open city,
why aren't we getting swarmed?

11:29.592 --> 11:31.802
- Don't worry about that.
- Well, I'm gonna.

11:31.802 --> 11:34.180
What was Marlene doing
with an infected kid?

11:34.180 --> 11:35.806
I'm not infected.

11:38.809 --> 11:40.645
She found me after I was bitten.

11:40.645 --> 11:42.647
- And she didn't shoot you.
- Clearly not.

11:43.773 --> 11:45.483
She locked me up
and had her guys test me every day

11:45.483 --> 11:46.609
to see if I was getting sick.

11:46.609 --> 11:47.860
Test you how?

11:47.860 --> 11:51.530
- I have to pee.
- Test you, how?

11:52.114 --> 11:53.950
They'd make me count to 10
and hold out my hand

11:53.950 --> 11:54.909
and then keep it steady.

11:54.909 --> 11:56.369
But, you know,
I think what really impressed them

11:56.369 --> 11:59.997
was the fact that I didn't
turn into a fucking monster.

12:00.539 --> 12:01.666
Now can I please?

12:06.420 --> 12:07.338
Fine.

12:08.172 --> 12:10.091
Back there. You can find a spot.

12:14.512 --> 12:15.638
And here.

12:18.182 --> 12:19.934
Tear out a few pages.

12:21.310 --> 12:22.728
There's not gonna be
anything bad in here?

12:22.728 --> 12:23.688
Just you.

12:23.688 --> 12:25.314
Oh, funny.

12:36.284 --> 12:37.618
Broken.

12:38.828 --> 12:42.164
Maybe a hairline. It'll heal fast.

12:51.507 --> 12:52.717
She made it through
the fuckin' night, Joel.

12:52.717 --> 12:53.884
It doesn't matter.

12:53.884 --> 12:56.512
It's gonna happen sooner or later.

12:58.222 --> 12:59.473
All right?
We're still close to the wall.

12:59.473 --> 13:00.766
We sneak her back into the QZ.

13:00.766 --> 13:02.518
We find a different way
to get the battery.

13:02.518 --> 13:04.729
This is our best shot.

13:06.897 --> 13:09.775
We take her back to the QZ,
someone's gonna notice her arm,

13:09.775 --> 13:12.320
they're gonna scan her,
then they'll kill her.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.030
Well, better them then us.

13:14.655 --> 13:15.948
You need to stop talkin' about this kid

13:15.948 --> 13:18.576
like she's got some kinda life
in front of her.

13:29.545 --> 13:30.671
You hungry?

13:31.130 --> 13:32.757
You can share some of ours.

13:32.757 --> 13:35.384
Thanks.
Marlene sent me with my own.

13:53.569 --> 13:54.987
Is that chicken?

13:54.987 --> 13:56.197
Yeah.

13:56.906 --> 13:59.492
Marlene said they get it from smugglers.

14:01.202 --> 14:02.953
Guess not you guys.

14:06.499 --> 14:08.501
- Hey. Hey!
- Why--

14:08.501 --> 14:11.045
why are you so important to Marlene?

14:11.545 --> 14:14.048
And don't lie to me
or we'll take you back.

14:14.048 --> 14:16.050
You take me back,
you don't get your battery.

14:16.050 --> 14:17.676
You heard that?

14:18.636 --> 14:20.930
Then you must've heard
that he wants to shoot you.

14:26.769 --> 14:29.271
I'm gonna talk to you
like you're an adult.

14:29.271 --> 14:30.564
Okay?

14:30.564 --> 14:32.566
Joel and I aren't good people.

14:33.943 --> 14:35.444
We're doin' this for us

14:35.444 --> 14:37.780
because, apparently,
you're worth something.

14:37.780 --> 14:41.075
But we don't know what you're worth
if we don't know what we have.

14:42.118 --> 14:43.869
So answer my question.

14:52.002 --> 14:53.254
She told me not to tell anybody,

14:53.254 --> 14:55.464
and now I'm telling
the first people that I--

15:00.469 --> 15:04.098
There's a Firefly base camp
somewhere out west,

15:04.098 --> 15:05.474
with doctors.

15:05.474 --> 15:07.226
They're working on a cure.

15:07.226 --> 15:08.185
I've heard this before.

15:08.185 --> 15:11.105
And whatever happened to me,
is the key to finding the vaccine.

15:11.105 --> 15:12.773
That's what this is?

15:13.399 --> 15:14.775
We've heard this a million times.

15:14.775 --> 15:17.361
Vaccines, miracle cures.
None of it works.

15:17.361 --> 15:18.863
- Ever.
- Fuck you, man. I didn't ask for this.

15:18.863 --> 15:20.030
You and me both.

15:20.030 --> 15:22.283
This isn't gonna end well, Tess.

15:22.283 --> 15:23.909
We need to go back.

15:32.168 --> 15:33.335
Let's just finish it.

15:33.961 --> 15:36.672
It doesn't matter if she is
or she isn't what the Fireflies say.

15:36.672 --> 15:39.758
If they believe that she is then,

15:40.593 --> 15:42.261
we get what we want.

15:50.269 --> 15:52.146
If she so much as twitches.

15:53.522 --> 15:54.607
Don't.

15:57.026 --> 15:58.527
Okay.

16:03.115 --> 16:04.241
Okay?

16:07.703 --> 16:08.621
Okay.

16:20.132 --> 16:21.008
Can I have a gun?

16:21.008 --> 16:22.301
- Absolutely not.
- No.

16:22.301 --> 16:25.346
Okay, Jesus. Fine. I'll have to throw
a fuckin' sandwich at them.

16:43.030 --> 16:44.156
It's clear.

17:06.262 --> 17:09.181
Yeah, looks different
in the daylight, huh?

17:24.738 --> 17:26.073
We should get movin'.

17:38.419 --> 17:40.838
It's like a fucked-up moon.

17:40.838 --> 17:43.549
- Is this where they bombed?
- Yeah.

17:44.216 --> 17:46.093
They hit most of the big cities like this.

17:46.093 --> 17:48.220
They had to slow the spread somehow.

17:49.930 --> 17:52.850
Worked here,
but it didn't in most places.

18:02.401 --> 18:03.902
So, the State House is across there.

18:03.902 --> 18:06.614
It's about a 10-minute walk
if you could go straight.

18:06.614 --> 18:09.033
- So?
- Long way or short way?

18:09.033 --> 18:12.244
I mean, it's the long way
or the "we're fuckin' dead" way.

18:12.244 --> 18:15.873
Well, I vote long way
just based on that limited information.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.460
We have to check it from the hotel first.

18:21.086 --> 18:21.962
Okay.

18:39.605 --> 18:41.482
Where the fuck are they already?

18:41.482 --> 18:43.817
You'll know it when they're close.

18:43.817 --> 18:45.444
I didn't know last time.

18:47.446 --> 18:49.198
How did you get bit?

18:50.074 --> 18:52.701
You know the old mall in the QZ?

18:52.701 --> 18:54.286
The one that's sealed off
and boarded up,

18:54.286 --> 18:56.288
and no one's supposed to go in, ever?

18:56.288 --> 18:57.498
That one?

18:58.165 --> 18:59.917
Whatever. I snuck in.

19:00.626 --> 19:02.753
Wanted to see what it was like.

19:02.753 --> 19:04.213
Didn't think there was
gonna be anything in there,

19:04.213 --> 19:06.840
and then one just
came at me outta nowhere.

19:07.925 --> 19:09.468
Thought I got away, but.

19:10.969 --> 19:12.888
So it was just you in there, alone?

19:14.807 --> 19:15.724
Yeah.

19:17.768 --> 19:19.436
How old are you?

19:19.436 --> 19:21.063
Fourteen.

19:21.063 --> 19:22.064
Wow.

19:23.107 --> 19:25.651
Well, I mean,
you got some balls on you, sister.

19:26.568 --> 19:27.444
Thanks.

19:40.916 --> 19:42.960
Nobody's gonna be comin' after you, right?

19:42.960 --> 19:44.211
Like, Mom,

19:44.211 --> 19:45.796
Dad,

19:45.796 --> 19:46.839
boyfriend?

19:46.839 --> 19:48.090
I'm an orphan,

19:48.090 --> 19:50.467
and, no.

19:55.556 --> 19:57.683
Everyone said the open city was crazy.

19:58.517 --> 20:01.145
Like, swarms of Infected
running around everywhere.

20:01.979 --> 20:03.272
Not exactly like that.

20:03.272 --> 20:05.899
You know, people like to tell stories.

20:06.734 --> 20:10.320
So, there aren't Super-Infected
that explode fungus spores on you?

20:10.320 --> 20:12.156
Shit, I hope not.

20:12.740 --> 20:16.243
Or ones with split-open heads
that see in the dark like bats?

20:29.506 --> 20:30.507
What was that?

20:34.887 --> 20:36.430
Let's keep movin'.

21:12.925 --> 21:15.260
You've gotta be kidding me!

21:16.220 --> 21:18.096
Ya ever stay in a place like this?

21:18.806 --> 21:19.890
No, a little out of our league.

21:19.890 --> 21:22.684
- How do you even know what this is?
- Have you heard of books?

21:25.479 --> 21:27.022
Wait, are we going in there?

21:27.564 --> 21:30.108
Yeah, we gotta get to the stairwell
on the other side.

21:32.319 --> 21:34.112
Well, I don't know how to swim.

21:34.738 --> 21:37.449
- Seriously?
- Do you think we have pools in the QZ?

21:37.449 --> 21:38.992
No, smart ass.

21:38.992 --> 21:39.993
I mean.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.456
I don't know how I was supposed
to know that.

21:55.634 --> 21:57.553
This is so gross.

22:00.264 --> 22:01.515
Check it out!

22:08.188 --> 22:09.731
Ding, ding.

22:10.148 --> 22:12.734
Yes, sir. I would like your
finest suite, please.

22:12.734 --> 22:15.028
Yes, ma'am.
Would you like me to take your luggage?

22:15.028 --> 22:18.323
- Yes, ma'am. Right away, ma'am--
- You're a weird kid.

22:18.323 --> 22:20.284
You're a weird kid.

22:20.284 --> 22:21.326
Oh fuck!

22:24.621 --> 22:26.582
Oh, my God.

22:30.961 --> 22:32.212
Sorry.

22:45.392 --> 22:49.605
- You okay?
- Yep. Fucking fabulous.

23:03.827 --> 23:06.246
Fuck. Holy shit.

23:06.246 --> 23:08.165
Come on, it wasn't that bad.

23:08.165 --> 23:10.417
You try climbing ten fuckin' floors
with our knees.

23:10.417 --> 23:12.044
See how ya feel.

23:22.179 --> 23:24.723
Well, when the fuck did that happen?

23:30.646 --> 23:32.189
Maybe that one.

23:32.898 --> 23:35.442
No.

23:36.068 --> 23:38.904
All right, well, I mean,
maybe I could climb up there,

23:38.904 --> 23:41.823
work my way around,
and open it from the inside?

23:42.491 --> 23:44.826
No, well, I'm the smallest,
so it'd be easier for me to get through.

23:45.869 --> 23:48.163
But you die and we get nothing.
You stay.

23:48.163 --> 23:49.790
Can you give me a hand?

24:09.810 --> 24:10.978
You good up there?

24:10.978 --> 24:16.692
Yeah, it's a bit of a mess,
so I'm gonna need a few minutes.

24:48.223 --> 24:49.349
Nice knife.

24:54.730 --> 24:57.357
- Where'd you learn to do that?
- The circus.

25:10.662 --> 25:12.205
Where are you from?

25:14.124 --> 25:15.042
Texas.

25:16.168 --> 25:18.962
- What about Tess?
- Detroit. It's in Michigan.

25:18.962 --> 25:21.715
I go to school. I know where Detroit is.

25:26.762 --> 25:29.473
So, you two like a--

25:29.473 --> 25:30.348
Pass.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.727
- How'd you end up in Boston?
- Pass.

25:34.394 --> 25:35.937
No more questions about me.

25:42.819 --> 25:44.196
How long do Infected live?

25:44.196 --> 25:45.572
I thought you went to school.

25:45.572 --> 25:47.741
It's a really shitty one.

25:50.368 --> 25:52.913
Well, some last about a month or two.

25:54.039 --> 25:56.583
But there's others been walkin' around
'bout 20 years.

26:01.004 --> 26:04.132
- Ever kill one?
- Yeah, I killed lots of 'em.

26:09.221 --> 26:10.347
Was it hard?

26:11.181 --> 26:13.517
Like, knowing they were people once?

26:17.229 --> 26:18.563
Sometimes.

26:21.525 --> 26:23.068
What about that guy last night?

26:28.281 --> 26:30.867
You can put the gun down, Joel.

26:40.502 --> 26:42.045
What now?

27:27.674 --> 27:29.467
There's so many.

27:29.467 --> 27:32.262
The last time we were here,
they were still deep inside the buildings.

27:32.262 --> 27:34.890
Then I guess enough people came through
looking for the QZ,

27:34.890 --> 27:37.142
they went inside seeking shelter,

27:37.142 --> 27:41.146
and that's how they get more and more
of the city bit by bit, year after year.

27:52.157 --> 27:53.700
They're connected.

27:54.492 --> 27:56.036
More than you know.

27:56.661 --> 27:58.914
The fungus also grows underground.

27:58.914 --> 28:02.709
Long fibers like wires,
some of them stretching over a mile.

28:02.709 --> 28:05.629
Now, you step on a patch
of cordyceps in one place,

28:05.629 --> 28:09.341
and you can wake a dozen Infected
from somewhere else.

28:09.966 --> 28:12.510
Now they know where you are,
now they come.

28:13.595 --> 28:15.931
You're not immune from being ripped apart.

28:16.806 --> 28:18.141
You understand?

28:19.601 --> 28:20.936
It's important.

28:21.811 --> 28:23.355
I'm tryin' to keep you alive.

28:30.779 --> 28:32.322
So we're not goin' that way.

28:33.615 --> 28:34.532
No.

28:36.284 --> 28:37.619
What do we do then?

28:38.828 --> 28:40.455
Short way?

28:44.251 --> 28:45.377
Museum.

29:06.690 --> 29:08.817
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

29:09.567 --> 29:12.028
Well, there's a way
across from the top floor.

29:12.028 --> 29:13.530
Well, then I guess it's fine.

29:13.530 --> 29:15.824
- We used to take it all the time.
- Okay.

29:15.824 --> 29:18.326
- Look, it was fine.
- Awesome.

29:29.379 --> 29:30.714
It's bone dry.

29:31.423 --> 29:33.758
It could mean they're
all finally dead in there.

29:39.431 --> 29:40.598
Oh, man.

29:42.559 --> 29:43.893
Marlene pack you one of these

29:43.893 --> 29:45.520
- or just sandwiches?
- Yeah.

29:47.355 --> 29:49.774
Okay, so, more ground rules.

29:49.774 --> 29:51.443
We're gonna go slowly.

29:51.443 --> 29:53.194
If we come up against anything,
you get behind us

29:53.194 --> 29:54.988
and ya stay there, okay?

29:54.988 --> 29:55.989
Yes.

30:00.827 --> 30:02.162
I have a spare hand.

30:02.662 --> 30:04.205
Congratulations.

30:31.191 --> 30:32.734
THE BOSTONIAN MUSEUM WELCOME

30:41.659 --> 30:43.119
EXIT

30:51.586 --> 30:53.880
GIFT SHOP OPEN WELCOME

30:58.635 --> 31:00.929
Yeah, cooked.

31:01.971 --> 31:03.515
Finally, some fuckin' luck.

31:03.973 --> 31:06.893
I guess we should've gone
this way in the first place.

31:08.353 --> 31:09.604
Oh shit!

31:15.193 --> 31:16.736
What the fuck did that?

31:21.866 --> 31:23.410
Maybe,

31:24.828 --> 31:28.164
maybe he was attacked outside,
and crawled through the doors.

31:28.164 --> 31:30.792
The door was open.
Could've been him.

31:32.127 --> 31:34.671
- I don't hear anything.
- Who would you hear?

31:36.339 --> 31:38.550
Who would you hear?

31:38.550 --> 31:40.802
Are you saying an Infected did that?

31:41.761 --> 31:44.764
Because I've been attacked by one
and it wasn't like that.

31:46.808 --> 31:50.895
Okay, from this point forward,
we are silent.

31:50.895 --> 31:53.064
Not quiet. Silent.

31:53.064 --> 31:56.901
- What--
- No. No questions. Just do it.

33:30.161 --> 33:33.122
INDEPENDENCE HALL

35:27.737 --> 35:31.366
They can't see, but they can hear.

36:07.318 --> 36:08.569
Run!

36:24.919 --> 36:26.212
Run, run!

39:09.500 --> 39:13.838
- You all right?
- Twisted ankle, but, yeah.

39:17.091 --> 39:18.509
You all right?

39:18.509 --> 39:21.137
Well, I didn't shit my pants, so.

39:24.015 --> 39:25.933
You fucking kidding me?

39:27.768 --> 39:30.688
I mean, if it was gonna
happen to one of us.

39:33.357 --> 39:34.442
Hey,

39:34.442 --> 39:36.277
let's get the fuck outta here.

39:55.004 --> 39:57.131
- Put this around your arm.
- Thanks.

40:00.509 --> 40:03.095
- Over there?
- Yeah, I know. It looks scary.

40:03.095 --> 40:06.098
That was scary. This is wood.

40:08.976 --> 40:11.520
Just wait there. Give us a minute.

40:22.531 --> 40:24.283
There's probably more ahead.

40:25.451 --> 40:26.994
So, we'll deal with it then.

40:27.954 --> 40:29.705
I got it. I got it.

40:33.668 --> 40:35.378
What about the kid?

40:35.378 --> 40:37.463
I mean, maybe the first bite didn't take,

40:37.463 --> 40:40.132
- but what about the second?
- How 'bout you just take the good news?

40:41.467 --> 40:42.593
Can you do that?

40:43.260 --> 40:46.222
Like to think, for once,
maybe we could actually win?

40:48.349 --> 40:50.267
Just go, go and watch her.

41:15.167 --> 41:16.711
Is it everything you hoped for?

41:18.004 --> 41:19.547
Jury's still out.

41:21.757 --> 41:24.301
But, man, you can't deny that view.

41:31.100 --> 41:33.144
C'mon, let's get there before it's dark.

42:50.721 --> 42:52.848
Where the fuck are they?

43:33.764 --> 43:34.890
Stay back.

44:06.630 --> 44:08.174
Joel?

44:08.924 --> 44:11.177
- What the fuck is going on?
- I don't know.

44:16.265 --> 44:18.225
They went inside.

44:23.022 --> 44:24.190
- Come on.
- Tess.

44:24.190 --> 44:25.357
Come on!

44:25.357 --> 44:26.567
Tess!

44:32.615 --> 44:34.617
EXIT

44:37.995 --> 44:39.538
Holy shit.

44:42.124 --> 44:43.292
Jesus.

44:52.885 --> 44:53.886
Okay.

44:53.886 --> 44:57.932
I mean, there's gotta be
a fuckin' radio or somethin', right?

45:00.726 --> 45:02.478
Who killed them? FEDRA?

45:03.687 --> 45:04.605
No.

45:07.066 --> 45:08.692
One of them got bit.

45:08.692 --> 45:10.736
The healthy ones fought the sick ones.
Everyone lost.

45:10.736 --> 45:13.364
Tess? What're you doin'?

45:13.906 --> 45:16.533
Where did Marlene say
that she was taking you?

45:16.533 --> 45:19.078
- Ellie!
- I don't know. Just west.

45:19.078 --> 45:20.746
Just west. Fuck. Okay.

45:20.746 --> 45:24.708
Well, I mean, one of them's gotta have
a map on them, right?

45:24.708 --> 45:26.919
- Joel, can ya help me?
- No!

45:26.919 --> 45:29.588
Tess, it's over.

45:29.588 --> 45:33.467
- We are going home.
- That's not my fucking home!

45:47.898 --> 45:49.441
I'm stayin'.

45:50.901 --> 45:54.947
I mean, our luck had to run out
sooner or later.

45:56.448 --> 45:57.992
Fuck.

45:58.951 --> 46:00.494
She's infected.

46:08.669 --> 46:09.795
Show me.

46:11.714 --> 46:12.840
Joel.

46:26.228 --> 46:27.980
Oops, right?

46:35.696 --> 46:37.614
Take your bandage off.

46:43.162 --> 46:44.288
Look.

46:44.955 --> 46:46.081
Joel?

46:48.000 --> 46:49.376
This is real.

46:49.376 --> 46:51.462
Joel, she's fucking real.

46:54.798 --> 46:56.383
I need you to get her
to Bill and Frank's.

46:56.383 --> 46:57.926
- No.
- They'll take her off your hands.

46:57.926 --> 46:59.303
- No.
- They'll handle it from here.

46:59.303 --> 47:00.596
No, no, no, I can't. They won't take her.

47:00.596 --> 47:02.931
- They're not gonna take her.
- They will 'cause you'll convince them.

47:02.931 --> 47:04.141
Yes, you will.

47:04.141 --> 47:06.060
I never ask you for anything,

47:06.060 --> 47:07.686
- not to feel the way I felt.
- No.

47:07.686 --> 47:09.521
Shut the fuck up 'cause I don't have time.

47:10.147 --> 47:11.690
This is your chance.

47:12.691 --> 47:14.234
You get her there,

47:14.943 --> 47:16.487
you keep her alive,

47:18.489 --> 47:20.407
and you set everything right.

47:23.410 --> 47:24.870
All the shit we did.

47:25.829 --> 47:27.748
Please say yes, Joel, please.

47:28.624 --> 47:29.750
Oh fuck!

48:19.425 --> 48:20.843
- How many?
- All of them.

48:20.843 --> 48:21.927
Maybe a minute.

48:35.232 --> 48:37.901
- What are you doing?
- Making sure that they don't follow you.

48:51.748 --> 48:52.875
Joel.

48:56.837 --> 48:58.755
Save who you can save.

49:07.347 --> 49:08.265
No!

49:08.807 --> 49:10.809
We're not leaving her!

49:10.809 --> 49:12.561
Get off me, you fucker!

49:12.561 --> 49:14.104
I'm not going with you!
