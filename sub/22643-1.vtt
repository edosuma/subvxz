00:49.715 --> 00:52.771
<i>Say hello to Idiosa Dartellum 7...</i>

00:52.851 --> 00:54.873
<i>...or the ID-7 virus.</i>

00:54.953 --> 00:56.756
<i>Nasty-looking little fucker?</i>

00:58.957 --> 01:03.449
<i>For the uninitiated, the ID-7 strain
makes stress hormone levels rise...</i>

01:03.529 --> 01:06.352
<i>...blocks neural paths,
essentially attacking our id...</i>

01:06.432 --> 01:09.656
<i>...and throwing off a very
important balance in our brains...</i>

01:11.636 --> 01:16.061
<i>...the balance between emotions and reason
that keep us from doing stupid shit...</i>

01:16.141 --> 01:18.897
<i>...things like punching your boss
in the face when angry...</i>

01:18.977 --> 01:21.500
<i>...or fucking your date in public when horny.</i>

01:21.580 --> 01:24.970
<i>That balance is temporarily severed,
causing inhibitions to drop...</i>

01:25.050 --> 01:27.373
<i>...and basic instincts
to rise to the surface...</i>

01:27.453 --> 01:31.944
<i>...as the infected fall victim to
what experts call emotional hijacking.</i>

01:32.524 --> 01:34.880
<i>Social media has tagged it the red-eye virus</i>

01:34.960 --> 01:37.194
<i>...for obvious reasons.</i>

01:45.303 --> 01:46.892
<i>So in a nutshell...</i>

01:46.972 --> 01:49.928
<i>...basic human dignity takes a sick leave.</i>

01:50.008 --> 01:53.460
<i>The first reported case of the red-eye
virus occurred 18 months ago...</i>

01:53.540 --> 01:56.201
<i>...in Des Moines, Iowa,
and quickly spread around the world.</i>

01:56.281 --> 02:00.070
<i>Since then, there have been over 1,000
confirmed outbreaks reported globally...</i>

02:00.150 --> 02:02.674
<i>...over half of which
are in the United States alone.</i>

02:02.754 --> 02:05.611
<i>The CDC is optimistic they can
contain the virus immediately...</i>

02:05.691 --> 02:08.614
<i>...through mandated quarantines,
and the nation will be virus-free...</i>

02:08.693 --> 02:11.743
<i>...by the end of the year as antibodies
are being aggressively tested.</i>

02:11.823 --> 02:15.921
<i>They also state the virus isn't lethal,
which is technically true.</i>

02:16.001 --> 02:21.405
<i>But while the virus can't kill,
the infected, or redders, can.</i>

02:23.241 --> 02:25.197
<i>Introducing Mr. Nevil Reed...</i>

02:25.277 --> 02:28.712
<i>...the first redder to be officially
cleared for murder.</i>

02:39.624 --> 02:42.814
<i>His legal defense alleged that those
infected with the ID-7 strain...</i>

02:42.894 --> 02:46.768
<i>...can't control their emotions and therefore
are not liable for the resulting actions.</i>

02:46.848 --> 02:49.271
<i>And thanks to a loophole,
the case was dismissed.</i>

02:49.351 --> 02:53.475
<i>So Nevil lost his shit, stabbed a co-worker
repeatedly in the face till dead...</i>

02:53.555 --> 02:55.911
<i>...and walked thanks a doctor's note.</i>

02:55.991 --> 02:57.812
<i>God bless the justice system.</i>

03:07.402 --> 03:10.025
<i>Welcome to the home of
Towers & Smythe Consulting...</i>

03:10.105 --> 03:12.894
<i>...the corporate scumbags hired
by the bigger corporate scumbags...</i>

03:12.974 --> 03:15.175
<i>...in the landmark Nevil Reed case.</i>

03:17.062 --> 03:21.303
<i>TSC is a firm fueled by greed,
duplicity, and moral decay...</i>

03:21.383 --> 03:24.584
<i>...a place that ironically screens
their job applicants for honesty...</i>

03:24.664 --> 03:26.865
<i>...loyalty, and integrity.</i>

03:31.126 --> 03:33.649
<i>Qualities I had in spades
when I was fresh-faced...</i>

03:33.729 --> 03:36.184
<i>...and ready to take on the world
my first day here.</i>

03:36.264 --> 03:38.687
<i>And here's me six months later...</i>

03:38.767 --> 03:41.323
<i>...late nights, no respect, the bad coffee...</i>

03:41.403 --> 03:43.559
<i>all the shit that comes
with paying your dues.</i>

03:43.639 --> 03:45.527
<i>But none of it could slow me down.</i>

03:45.607 --> 03:48.230
<i>I was striving for the success
my family never had...</i>

03:48.310 --> 03:51.500
<i>...a seat at the big kids' table
with all the fixings...</i>

03:51.580 --> 03:54.615
<i>...all while paying back
those goddamn student loans.</i>

03:59.020 --> 04:03.579
<i>But the higher I rose, the more I felt
like I was losing myself in the process.</i>

04:03.659 --> 04:06.214
<i>And after discovering that loophole
that won the Reed case...</i>

04:06.294 --> 04:09.150
<i>...the requisite promotion quickly followed.</i>

04:09.230 --> 04:11.853
<i>But by then, it didn't matter
that I thought he was guilty as fuck.</i>

04:11.933 --> 04:13.889
<i>I just wanted the corner office.</i>

04:13.969 --> 04:16.769
<i>And for my sins, they gave me one.</i>

04:19.507 --> 04:21.319
<i>What a dick.</i>

04:32.119 --> 04:34.081
Towers and Smythe.

04:56.724 --> 04:59.849
- I mean, how fucking stupid can you get?
- I'm sorry. I...

04:59.929 --> 05:02.537
You're sorry? I don't fucking pay you
to be fucking sorry, Jenny.

05:02.617 --> 05:05.514
Hey. Morning. Dude, you gotta see this.
You gotta see this. Come over here.

05:05.594 --> 05:08.150
- What's up?
- I just got this today.

05:08.990 --> 05:11.798
Oh, man, last year's Christmas party.

05:12.628 --> 05:15.262
That looks like you.

05:17.164 --> 05:19.288
Yeah. That's you.

05:20.068 --> 05:21.289
Where'd you get that?

05:21.369 --> 05:23.947
I googled "a small-dick douche
makes assistant work hard...

05:24.027 --> 05:27.536
...for fake promise of a raise,"
and it was just, like, top search result...

05:27.616 --> 05:30.871
...like, number one.
Listen, leave her alone...

05:30.951 --> 05:35.257
...or I'll sell this to your wife for half
of the half she'll get from your divorce.

05:35.337 --> 05:37.170
It's a good talk, bro.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.554
Thank you.

05:44.259 --> 05:46.148
- <i>May not be much...</i>
- Morning, Miles.

05:46.228 --> 05:49.686
<i>...but I'll take whatever goodwill
I can pillage to sleep better at night.</i>

05:50.766 --> 05:52.822
<i>Thank God for coffee, right?</i>

05:54.002 --> 05:57.566
- Your 9:00 a.m. is in meeting room three.
- Where is my coffee cup?

05:57.646 --> 06:00.928
- Don't know. Also, I...
- Do you know who took it?

06:01.008 --> 06:04.793
- No. But I can get you another one.
- I don't want another mug. I want my mug.

06:05.113 --> 06:07.203
Yep, David from Vanda Corp.

06:08.083 --> 06:10.693
- Derek. Derek.
- What?

06:11.073 --> 06:14.689
- David, line one.
- Okay. Put him on.

06:16.291 --> 06:18.480
David, I was just about to call you.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.516
<i>David? Who the hell's David? It's Lucy.</i>

06:21.596 --> 06:24.185
Miles, this is my sister.

06:24.865 --> 06:27.222
- I'm sorry.
- <i>It is so hard to get you on the phone.</i>

06:27.302 --> 06:29.791
<i>I just wanted to see if you were
coming up for my birthday next month.</i>

06:29.871 --> 06:33.109
Yeah. No, actually.

06:33.189 --> 06:35.477
I'm so sorry. I will not be able
to make it to your birthday.

06:35.557 --> 06:37.799
But I will totally make it up to you.

06:37.879 --> 06:41.570
<i>Well, if you're not gonna show up,
at least paint me something cool.</i>

06:41.650 --> 06:44.772
- How do you know I started painting?
- <i>Miles said you're pretty good.</i>

06:44.852 --> 06:45.841
Did he?

06:45.921 --> 06:48.143
<i>Yeah. You should sign up
for art classes or something.</i>

06:48.223 --> 06:51.413
I don't have time for art classes.

06:51.493 --> 06:54.028
<i>Yeah. You don't have time for anything.</i>

06:56.765 --> 06:58.820
Yes. You are correct.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.990
I do not have time for anything.
I don't have time for this conversation.

07:02.070 --> 07:03.492
- But I love you very much.
- <i>Wait, Derek...</i>

07:03.572 --> 07:07.357
Thank you so much for calling.
I gotta go. I love you. Bye.

07:17.318 --> 07:19.341
What's my 9:00?

07:20.021 --> 07:22.489
Good morning. Pat Sorenson's office.

07:25.293 --> 07:27.161
Right this way, sir.

08:02.998 --> 08:04.116
How can I help you?

08:04.196 --> 08:07.522
My client wants to pay this overdue
debt to reverse the foreclosure.

08:07.602 --> 08:10.535
We just need TSC to tell
the bank to allow more time.

08:10.615 --> 08:14.476
I'm sorry to inform you, but our client
has a strong no-refinance policy.

08:14.556 --> 08:16.331
Then what do I tell mine?

08:16.411 --> 08:19.763
Would you be open to discussing
the possibility of a deed in lieu?

08:23.383 --> 08:26.374
You don't know
what I'm talking about, do you?

08:26.454 --> 08:28.443
- You should see a lawyer.
- I am a lawyer.

08:28.523 --> 08:31.136
If you were a lawyer,
you would know what a deed in lieu is.

08:31.216 --> 08:33.265
You're one of the borrowers, aren't you?

08:34.562 --> 08:36.073
So what's a deed in lieu?

08:36.154 --> 08:39.631
It doesn't matter.
Bank wouldn't agree to it anyway.

08:43.669 --> 08:46.895
Look, you're not the first borrower
to try to pull this kind of scam.

08:47.575 --> 08:49.999
Miss, this is a non-smoking room.

08:51.479 --> 08:53.547
So come stop me, suit.

09:00.721 --> 09:01.922
Wait.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.248
We just need two more months.

09:07.328 --> 09:11.770
Families are involved here, but nobody
listens, not the banks, not the lawyers.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.196
I can't get past their damn secretaries.

09:15.836 --> 09:18.146
Look, I am very sorry
this is happening to you.

09:18.226 --> 09:20.295
- Then don't kick me out.
- The bank is kicking you out.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.688
- The bank is your client.
- It's the firm's client.

09:22.768 --> 09:24.978
The firm's partners call the shots.

09:27.532 --> 09:30.453
No one raindrop thinks it caused the flood.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.588
My mother used to say that.

09:36.391 --> 09:38.881
Now I understand what it means.

09:39.761 --> 09:41.316
Is there anything else I can do to help?

09:41.396 --> 09:44.819
You can start by telling me the partner
calling the shots on the case.

09:44.899 --> 09:47.901
Sure. That would be...

09:53.541 --> 09:55.564
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

09:56.844 --> 09:57.866
Irene Smythe.

09:57.946 --> 10:01.563
Well, I want a word with this
Irene Smythe or whoever right now.

10:01.643 --> 10:04.876
Sure. Let me get her on the phone.

10:09.424 --> 10:12.180
- This way, ma'am.
- Get off me!

10:12.260 --> 10:14.083
We're not done here!

10:15.363 --> 10:17.852
I'm gonna sue you! I'm gonna sue all of you!

10:19.132 --> 10:20.695
Fuckers!

10:25.139 --> 10:27.163
You're in deep shit, too!

10:29.143 --> 10:30.709
You're in deep shit.

10:31.659 --> 10:34.869
Brenda wasn't feeling well,
so I had to go out to the penthouse...

10:34.949 --> 10:37.008
...to cover for her for a bit.

10:37.685 --> 10:42.076
Turns out The Boss is meeting
with Kara and I'm pretty sure...

10:42.156 --> 10:45.981
...they were talking about you fucking
up a Vanda Corp case or something.

10:46.061 --> 10:49.150
Wait, what? Are you...

10:49.230 --> 10:52.020
I don't work Vanda Corp.
That's Kara's client.

10:52.100 --> 10:54.050
I know, right?

10:54.130 --> 10:55.961
Oh, no.

11:18.226 --> 11:20.245
- <i>How can I help you?</i>
- Derek Cho.

11:20.325 --> 11:23.751
- Need an access code to the eighth floor.
- <i>To see whom?</i>

11:23.831 --> 11:28.656
<i>Kara Powell, director of operations,
not effective for client matters...</i>

11:28.736 --> 11:32.027
<i>...but with all things related to navigating
internal company politics...</i>

11:32.107 --> 11:34.295
<i>...she's fuckin' Mussolini.</i>

11:34.375 --> 11:36.664
<i>We call her The Siren.</i>

11:36.744 --> 11:38.832
<i>She's got The Boss's ear.</i>

11:39.430 --> 11:42.037
<i>And her songs are sweet poison.</i>

11:43.885 --> 11:45.501
<i>Mr. Cho.</i>

11:47.622 --> 11:49.133
<i>Mr. Cho.</i>

11:51.993 --> 11:55.150
To see... Kara Powell.

11:55.230 --> 11:57.068
<i>One moment, please.</i>

11:58.900 --> 12:03.921
Your pass code is 7-8-5-star-9-5.

12:11.179 --> 12:13.635
<i>You expected me to create
a dedicated office mobile app</i>

12:13.715 --> 12:16.838
- <i>...with servers that run on hamster wheels.</i>
- Ray, stop talking.

12:16.918 --> 12:19.607
If I hear another whining excuse from you...

12:19.687 --> 12:23.144
...I'll make sure you're back to building
porn-site banner ads by lunch.

12:23.224 --> 12:26.081
- Do you understand me?
- <i>Yes, fine.</i>

12:26.161 --> 12:28.616
So stop playing video games
in your troll cave...

12:28.696 --> 12:32.287
...and get the interoffice apps
updated ASAP, okay, sweetie?

12:32.367 --> 12:36.051
Okay. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. Asshole.

12:36.471 --> 12:39.360
- What I can do for you?
- That's a nice mug.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.644
- Where'd you get it?
- I told my assistant to get me one.

12:42.724 --> 12:45.467
- And where did she get it?
- Meg!

12:45.547 --> 12:49.137
Derek here wants to know
where you got the mug.

12:49.217 --> 12:51.039
From a kitchen downstairs.

12:51.519 --> 12:55.677
- Okay. And why did you choose that one?
- Because the other ones were filthy.

12:55.757 --> 12:59.347
- And why do you think this one wasn't?
- Because the maid cleaned it.

12:59.427 --> 13:02.784
Incorrect. I cleaned this mug
because this mug is mine.

13:02.864 --> 13:06.654
And what's mine is mine.
And what's yours is yours.

13:06.734 --> 13:09.991
- You're getting to a point.
- Vanda Corp is your client.

13:10.071 --> 13:11.893
That blood's on your hands.

13:12.773 --> 13:16.531
- So now you wanna share.
- I can't share what isn't mine.

13:16.611 --> 13:20.402
Vanda Corp has filed more than 100 account
cases through us in the last two years.

13:20.482 --> 13:22.537
Well, then I hope they have
a good case manager.

13:22.617 --> 13:27.352
You mean managers. No one can work
a client that big without delegating.

13:27.432 --> 13:30.078
And according to the annual
work distribution sheet...

13:30.158 --> 13:32.394
That hasn't been updated in years.

13:32.474 --> 13:36.235
...one of Vanda Corp's
complaint cases was assigned...

13:37.865 --> 13:39.682
...to you.

13:40.702 --> 13:42.994
File 45A.

13:46.345 --> 13:48.099
I'm being set up.

13:52.013 --> 13:55.036
Wow. Heads will roll.

13:55.916 --> 13:58.383
- This will cost Vanda...
- Give me this.

14:01.456 --> 14:04.697
- This was planted.
- I'll cut you a deal. Plead guilty.

14:04.777 --> 14:07.975
- Not guilty.
- The corpse was found inside your office.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.398
You knew exactly where to find it.

14:10.478 --> 14:13.607
- Do you wanna take this upstairs?
- Great idea.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.559
Take your file.

14:17.738 --> 14:20.575
Wanna swipe your key card,
or should I swipe mine?

14:21.875 --> 14:24.015
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

14:24.095 --> 14:26.137
You don't have clearance.

14:28.716 --> 14:29.959
My bad.

14:31.519 --> 14:33.441
Don't you worry, little one.

14:33.521 --> 14:36.589
Daddy will pay for abandoning you
and leaving you to die...

14:36.669 --> 14:38.219
...in that cold, dirty dumpster.

14:38.299 --> 14:41.883
No, no. You died when you drowned
because Mommy left you in the bathtub...

14:41.963 --> 14:46.388
...while she went shopping for shoes.
But don't worry. Daddy will make her pay.

14:46.968 --> 14:49.150
Too bad Mommy outranks Daddy.

14:49.230 --> 14:53.431
- Mommy's a backstabbing bitch.
- That's why Mommy outranks Daddy.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.398
- Brenda, what's his mood?
- He's drawing.

14:57.478 --> 14:59.081
Oh, shit.

14:59.881 --> 15:03.143
<i>John Towers, capital "T" in TSC...</i>

15:03.223 --> 15:07.075
<i>...king of the castle, top of the food
chain, and total fucking maniac...</i>

15:07.155 --> 15:10.345
<i>...you know, your typical
American success story.</i>

15:10.425 --> 15:13.231
<i>Did I mention that he also
dabbles in the fine arts?</i>

15:16.930 --> 15:18.680
Tell me what you see here.

15:19.600 --> 15:23.214
I see that those soldiers' lives
are in danger, sir.

15:23.294 --> 15:24.425
Do you think they'll make it?

15:24.505 --> 15:27.679
No, sir. The fuse is too short.
It's too late to run.

15:27.759 --> 15:29.600
And what do you think
they should be doing instead?

15:29.680 --> 15:31.702
May I, sir?

15:41.888 --> 15:45.240
So simple and yet so effective.
Can you see it, Derek?

15:45.320 --> 15:47.915
Can you see the solution to our problem here?

15:47.995 --> 15:51.218
I think you mean her problem
because she was the one that...

15:51.598 --> 15:55.123
Give me the file. This is our bomb.

15:55.203 --> 15:57.625
The fuse is already burning.

15:57.705 --> 16:00.695
So should we run like cowards and die?

16:00.775 --> 16:02.597
We are brave, sir.

16:02.677 --> 16:04.980
I'm so glad you said that...

16:05.060 --> 16:08.770
...because any second now, Vanda Corp
is gonna find out about this mess...

16:08.850 --> 16:11.306
...and I'm gonna need some scalps.

16:11.676 --> 16:14.645
So, who dropped the ball?

16:14.725 --> 16:17.044
I hate pointing fingers, but may I suggest...

16:17.124 --> 16:19.774
...you check the annual work
distribution sheet?

16:20.094 --> 16:22.584
Someone cooked the fucking worksheet.

16:23.664 --> 16:25.253
Sir.

16:25.733 --> 16:27.555
Go on.

16:27.835 --> 16:30.958
Have you noticed that whenever
there's a problem like this...

16:31.038 --> 16:35.217
...it's almost always
the same soldier involved?

16:35.977 --> 16:39.647
Because down in the trenches,
we have all noticed.

16:40.047 --> 16:44.887
And we wonder if discharging this problem
soldier might be the solution...

16:44.967 --> 16:48.779
...to preventing this kind of mess
from ever happening again.

16:49.650 --> 16:52.451
- And who would that be?
- May I?

17:09.042 --> 17:11.532
Thank you, Derek. You can leave.

17:12.512 --> 17:14.902
- Let's discuss.
- Yes, sir.

17:14.982 --> 17:17.074
- I...
- Leave.

17:33.634 --> 17:35.492
You got a sec?

17:51.052 --> 17:53.321
Nothing like a little power meditation.

17:53.401 --> 17:55.386
This one's new.

17:56.008 --> 17:59.116
- Declan's walking already?
- Wobbling, actually...

17:59.196 --> 18:01.517
...like you were last Friday night.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.883
- Thanks for the ride, by the way.
- Thanks for puking in my car.

18:05.963 --> 18:07.855
That's what friends are for.

18:07.935 --> 18:11.138
So debrief me. What happened?

18:11.218 --> 18:14.011
Just found someone else's shit
swept under my carpet.

18:14.091 --> 18:16.080
What kind of shit?

18:16.160 --> 18:18.082
Vanda Corp shit.

18:18.162 --> 18:20.918
It's a seven-figure mistake.
I didn't even touch the file.

18:20.998 --> 18:22.620
Don't sweat it.

18:22.700 --> 18:27.024
Those clowns working Vanda Corp
are a bunch of a serial screw-ups.

18:27.104 --> 18:29.494
Look, I realize you might
not wanna divulge...

18:29.574 --> 18:31.330
The Siren.

18:32.810 --> 18:36.701
All right. Let's take a beat to strategize.

18:37.281 --> 18:41.038
Since the promotion, you could possibly
be in charge of a case that big...

18:41.118 --> 18:43.908
...but not big enough to be untouchable.

18:43.988 --> 18:47.011
That's why she chose you.
You're the perfect fall guy.

18:47.091 --> 18:49.582
So before even taking this upstairs...

18:50.962 --> 18:55.156
...you already took this upstairs
and made a mess of things.

18:57.101 --> 18:58.219
Fuck.

18:58.299 --> 19:01.158
Say I punch a rhino in the face.

19:01.238 --> 19:03.695
Would you call that brave or stupid?

19:04.075 --> 19:05.596
Brave...

19:05.976 --> 19:07.812
...and stupid.

19:07.892 --> 19:10.873
See how bravery and stupidity can overlap?

19:11.193 --> 19:14.782
Now that you understand that, let me give her
a call and see if I can't find a way...

19:14.862 --> 19:17.708
- ...to cut you a deal.
- She already offered me a deal.

19:17.788 --> 19:21.546
I told her to suck it and that this is war.

19:21.626 --> 19:24.744
- War is over, moron.
- Come on in, Kara.

19:24.824 --> 19:27.728
- How so?
- Natural selection happened.

19:27.808 --> 19:30.339
Pack your shit.
Boxes are on the second floor.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.820
- You're fucking kidding me?
- Derek, calm down.

19:34.358 --> 19:36.223
You blew him, didn't you?

19:36.303 --> 19:38.796
Like I need to stoop to that level.

19:39.076 --> 19:40.630
Now...

19:41.841 --> 19:44.013
...get the fuck out of my face.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.270
I'm taking this to The Nine.

19:46.350 --> 19:48.974
Sure. Good luck with that.

19:50.154 --> 19:52.013
And I want my mug back.

19:53.791 --> 19:57.281
<i>The Nine, the company's board of directors.</i>

19:57.361 --> 20:00.885
Good morning, everybody.
This is the Vanda Corp file.

20:00.965 --> 20:03.320
<i>No one here goes up or down
without their vote.</i>

20:03.400 --> 20:05.656
<i>Rumor has it that they're actually
cybernetic organisms...</i>

20:05.736 --> 20:08.092
<i>...but that hasn't been
officially confirmed yet.</i>

20:08.172 --> 20:11.929
<i>Now, there's a common misconception about
the death gesture during gladiatorial combat.</i>

20:12.009 --> 20:16.000
<i>The actual phrase used in Roman texts
doesn't translate as thumbs down...</i>

20:16.080 --> 20:17.432
<i>...but rather thumbs turned.</i>

20:17.512 --> 20:21.272
Personally, I think we should hang,
draw and quarter the little fucker.

20:21.352 --> 20:23.849
But... you know, that's just me.

20:24.329 --> 20:26.744
- So let's vote.
- <i>That's because the victors...</i>

20:26.824 --> 20:29.980
<i>...finished off their opponents
with a sword thrust across the throat.</i>

20:30.060 --> 20:34.075
So it's unanimous. Call Lester.

20:34.155 --> 20:37.488
<i>Enter Lester McGill, head of human resources.</i>

20:37.568 --> 20:40.580
<i>No, not her. That guy.</i>

20:44.058 --> 20:46.030
<i>He takes care of the firm's layoffs.</i>

20:46.110 --> 20:50.462
<i>He's as cold as his methods
are efficient, a perfect fit here.</i>

20:51.452 --> 20:54.139
<i>Naturally, we call him the reaper...</i>

20:55.319 --> 20:58.735
<i>...and he's the last person you want
to see standing at your doorway.</i>

21:00.991 --> 21:04.221
Mind if I come in... Derek?

21:04.301 --> 21:06.270
If I said no?

21:07.130 --> 21:08.989
Thank you.

21:13.903 --> 21:16.127
Do you even know what happened?

21:16.507 --> 21:18.152
I don't care what happened.

21:18.232 --> 21:20.631
You must be good friends with Kara, then.

21:20.711 --> 21:24.002
I hope she dies promptly.

21:24.782 --> 21:27.070
Glad we're on the same page.

21:27.150 --> 21:30.241
The Nine listen to you,
and I have proof that...

21:30.321 --> 21:31.909
- Sign here...
- ...this was not my mist...

21:31.989 --> 21:33.377
...and here.

21:33.457 --> 21:35.313
What the hell are you doing?

21:35.793 --> 21:37.768
My job.

21:37.848 --> 21:39.517
So you are on her side.

21:39.597 --> 21:43.120
I'm on the right side. Always am.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.426
That's why it's me firing you.

21:47.203 --> 21:49.062
Fuck you.

21:50.707 --> 21:53.860
Sign these documents from upstairs
so I can clear accounting...

21:53.940 --> 21:57.205
...to transfer your severance pay
into your account.

22:03.986 --> 22:06.566
Do you know what this is?
This is a statement...

22:06.646 --> 22:09.513
...saying that I take full responsibility
over the Vanda Corp mess.

22:09.593 --> 22:12.983
I'll have to file that
under "N" for "not my problem."

22:13.063 --> 22:15.186
I could be disbarred.

22:15.266 --> 22:17.418
I could face legal action from the client.

22:17.498 --> 22:19.156
I'm just the messenger, Derek.

22:19.236 --> 22:22.593
Yelling at me is like yelling
at your watch because you're late.

22:22.673 --> 22:25.099
Why would I sign this crap?

22:27.544 --> 22:29.403
To get rich.

22:32.916 --> 22:33.971
Wow.

22:34.051 --> 22:37.345
Glad to see we're now on the same page.

22:40.191 --> 22:42.012
Glad to see I'm not.

22:43.778 --> 22:45.816
You want to do this the hard way?

22:45.896 --> 22:48.119
I wanna do this the right way.

22:49.099 --> 22:51.252
I wanna speak with him and The Nine.

22:51.332 --> 22:53.758
Executive decisions
are not subject to appeal.

22:53.838 --> 22:55.893
This one fucking better be...

22:55.973 --> 22:58.796
...because I'm not leaving this
building until I plead my case.

22:58.876 --> 23:00.467
Understood.

23:41.986 --> 23:45.412
This building is under quarantine.
Get back inside.

24:24.394 --> 24:26.951
What's going on here? You can't tell me...

24:27.031 --> 24:29.186
- What the...
- ...hell is going on?

24:29.266 --> 24:32.312
<i>One of our pathogen sniffers
in the building's ventilation system...</i>

24:32.392 --> 24:34.458
<i>...picked up traces of the ID-7 virus.</i>

24:34.538 --> 24:37.855
And who authorized you to install
a sniffer in my building anyway?

24:37.935 --> 24:41.532
Since the outbreak in Des Moines,
detection devices are now legally required...

24:41.612 --> 24:44.842
- ...in public places.
- Des Moines. Fuck.

24:44.922 --> 24:47.805
<i>According to our projections,
those infected in the building...</i>

24:47.885 --> 24:52.076
<i>...will begin to display symptoms
soon, if not already.</i>

24:52.786 --> 24:56.711
<i>Our experts have already released
a neutralizer into your ventilation system.</i>

24:56.791 --> 25:00.918
<i>All traces of the virus should be
eliminated in approximately eight hours.</i>

25:00.998 --> 25:03.891
<i>Until then, this building
is officially under quarantine.</i>

25:03.971 --> 25:06.216
So what are we supposed to do
for the next eight hours?

25:06.296 --> 25:08.053
<i>Try to remain calm.</i>

25:09.206 --> 25:13.097
<i>So there I was getting the shit kicked out
of me on the lobby floor by this asshole.</i>

25:13.177 --> 25:16.118
<i>And then... something...</i>

25:16.198 --> 25:18.372
<i>...happened!</i>

25:19.936 --> 25:23.510
I don't wanna remain calm! I want this fixed.

25:27.457 --> 25:29.743
Hey. It's me. It's me. You all right?

25:29.823 --> 25:32.246
I think I just... I think I just
punched a rhino in the face.

25:32.326 --> 25:34.084
- What?
- He attacked me.

25:34.164 --> 25:36.657
And then I just kicked his ass.

25:38.402 --> 25:41.959
- I'm going to go talk to The Nine.
- No. Fuck this place!

25:42.039 --> 25:45.396
This mess is a blessing in disguise,
trust me. You don't wanna end up like me.

25:45.476 --> 25:47.798
What are you talking about?
You have everything figured out!

25:47.878 --> 25:53.270
No, Derek. This meditation
and this incense, it's all bullshit.

25:53.350 --> 25:57.862
You think I like the taste of cale?
Come on! I'm fuckin' dead inside.

25:57.942 --> 26:00.811
But they have me wrong. I have to tell them.

26:00.891 --> 26:03.347
Do you have any idea what they're capable of?

26:03.427 --> 26:06.951
Just hide out in your office
until the virus subsides...

26:07.031 --> 26:09.720
...then walk out those doors
and don't look back.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.457
Free as a bird. All right?

26:13.537 --> 26:14.691
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:14.771 --> 26:17.027
- Okay.
- Now come on.

26:17.107 --> 26:20.577
Put some peanut butter in your
wheatgrass shot. What do you say?

26:26.783 --> 26:30.286
- Motherfucker!
- <i>Until the quarantine is over...</i>

26:30.366 --> 26:33.644
<i>...we'll need your cooperation
to keep the situation under control.</i>

26:33.724 --> 26:36.913
We know better than anyone else
that this virus...

26:36.993 --> 26:39.897
...turns people into maniacs
or blathering idiots.

26:39.977 --> 26:43.754
<i>As you may know, the virus triggers
a breakdown of moral barriers...</i>

26:43.834 --> 26:47.330
<i>...unleashing repressed emotions
in the infected, including anger...</i>

26:47.410 --> 26:51.295
- <i>...depression, fear, lust.</i>
- Like cocaine?

26:51.375 --> 26:54.857
<i>An infected individual would make
a coke addict look like a model citizen...</i>

26:54.937 --> 26:57.935
- <i>...by comparison.</i>
- But we still feel normal.

26:58.015 --> 27:00.871
<i>The virus can cause drastic mood swings...</i>

27:00.951 --> 27:04.171
<i>...with potentially violent
and severe consequences.</i>

27:04.251 --> 27:08.178
<i>It would be best if stressful
work-related situations were avoided.</i>

27:08.258 --> 27:11.381
Yeah. I'm going to come to your house,
and I'm going to fucking kill you!

27:11.461 --> 27:14.348
- Bye, Mom.
- <i>Antidepressants, stimulants...</i>

27:14.428 --> 27:18.055
<i>...even caffeine can accelerate
the virus's effect.</i>

27:18.135 --> 27:21.565
Meg, make more fucking coffee!

27:28.378 --> 27:33.838
So, what happens when 287 employees...

27:34.618 --> 27:39.610
...with average billing rates
of $200 an hour...

27:39.690 --> 27:43.384
...stop working for eight hours?

27:47.730 --> 27:49.622
You don't know?

27:52.768 --> 27:55.676
I lose half a million dollars!

27:55.756 --> 27:59.059
Now, crack your whips.
Everybody goes back to work.

27:59.139 --> 28:02.516
And if they don't like it,
they are terminated immediately...

28:02.596 --> 28:05.656
...and no severance packages.
Put the fear of me in them.

28:06.566 --> 28:09.840
- What now?
- <i>Derek Cho wants clearance to come up.</i>

28:09.920 --> 28:12.176
- What for?
- <i>He said he reconsidered...</i>

28:12.256 --> 28:15.482
<i>...but he wants to have a word
with you and The Nine first.</i>

28:17.911 --> 28:21.743
<i>Your pass code is 8-star-1-9-9, fuck-head.</i>

28:29.156 --> 28:31.198
Fuck you!

28:33.143 --> 28:35.466
No, no. No, up.

28:35.546 --> 28:39.178
Up. Up. Let me the fuck up!

28:45.255 --> 28:46.978
<i>Colton Snyder...</i>

28:47.435 --> 28:49.276
<i>...aka The Bull...</i>

28:49.756 --> 28:51.737
<i>...The Boss' unofficial left hook.</i>

28:53.964 --> 28:56.253
<i>Nobody knows his exact job description.</i>

28:56.333 --> 28:58.655
<i>But whenever there's a hint
of something dirty going on...</i>

28:58.735 --> 29:01.562
- Take his phone.
- <i>...there he is.</i>

29:12.215 --> 29:13.944
<i>Hello, Derek.</i>

29:14.024 --> 29:17.540
<i>Look, I am so sorry we didn't get
a chance to meet again.</i>

29:17.620 --> 29:20.344
<i>Things came up. You know how it is.</i>

29:20.424 --> 29:22.433
<i>Now, I know what you're thinking...</i>

29:22.513 --> 29:26.603
"Nevil Reed, he got away with murder.
Maybe I can have a little fun here."

29:26.683 --> 29:31.255
Did you really think
that I didn't see that coming?

29:31.335 --> 29:34.641
Actually, I was just gonna
ask for my job back.

29:34.721 --> 29:37.511
<i>But I like your idea, too.</i>

29:37.591 --> 29:39.846
<i>Well, I'm going to beat you to the punch.</i>

29:42.264 --> 29:45.285
Now, that sounds like it hurt. Is he hurt?

29:45.365 --> 29:48.606
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Is he crying?</i>

29:49.786 --> 29:52.681
- No, sir.
- <i>Well, why isn't he fucking crying?</i>

30:00.263 --> 30:02.312
He is now, sir.

30:02.392 --> 30:04.391
<i>Now, I wanna hear a bone break.</i>

30:04.471 --> 30:07.309
They say the femur is the most difficult
bone in the body to break...

30:07.389 --> 30:09.276
...but I'll settle for a pinkie.

30:10.507 --> 30:12.366
I'm coming, Derek.

30:18.581 --> 30:21.708
- What's happening?
- Motherfuckers!

30:29.760 --> 30:33.220
Can someone tell me
what the fuck is going on in there?

30:43.874 --> 30:45.199
Ewan?

30:47.611 --> 30:50.903
I... smell...

30:53.483 --> 30:55.008
...toast.

30:58.555 --> 31:00.076
Ewan.

31:00.156 --> 31:02.779
- Ewan! Ewan!
- Ewan?

31:02.859 --> 31:05.081
<i>Ewan!</i>

31:05.161 --> 31:08.574
- You killed Ewan?
- There's been an accident.

31:08.995 --> 31:13.470
Do you have any idea how many billable hours
I'm gonna lose until I find a replacement?

31:14.370 --> 31:16.909
I'm worried about the body
right now. I killed him.

31:16.989 --> 31:21.165
You didn't kill him.
The virus killed him. You're infected.

31:21.245 --> 31:25.642
You have impunity!
We have a precedent in Nevil Reed.

31:25.722 --> 31:28.108
- <i>You can thank Derek for that.</i>
- Motherfucker.

31:28.188 --> 31:30.210
Thank you for that, Derek.

31:30.787 --> 31:34.081
<i>Lock him up with the other one
and then get back up here.</i>

32:30.680 --> 32:33.587
- What are you doing here?
- They fired me.

32:34.517 --> 32:37.331
That's nice. Justice is served for once.

32:37.411 --> 32:38.608
What are you doing here?

32:38.688 --> 32:42.379
Security called the cops, but this place was
quarantined before they could show up...

32:42.459 --> 32:44.848
...so they threw me in this hellhole.

32:44.928 --> 32:49.085
I'm suing everyone and their grandmother
when I get out of here, I swear to God.

32:49.165 --> 32:51.788
Good luck. It's ID-7!

32:51.868 --> 32:54.300
No one's liable for anything that they do.

32:55.555 --> 32:58.460
- Just like any other day for you.
- Yeah.

32:58.540 --> 33:00.564
We're not liable for what
we do in here, either.

33:00.644 --> 33:04.333
Nice, then I'll have your balls
for dinner for that shit you pulled!

33:04.413 --> 33:07.918
Wait! Wait! Wait! This might sound crazy,
but I think we can help each other out here.

33:07.998 --> 33:12.916
Okay? You remember Irene Smythe,
the woman that fucking screwed you?

33:12.996 --> 33:15.379
She's in the building's penthouse right now.

33:15.459 --> 33:18.546
- So what?
- You help me get to the top...

33:19.326 --> 33:20.927
...and she's all yours.

33:22.466 --> 33:25.289
This is our shot to hold
these assholes accountable...

33:25.369 --> 33:27.997
...for all the fucking damage
that they've done!

33:28.271 --> 33:31.495
And our chance goes away
as soon as this quarantine is over.

33:32.075 --> 33:33.664
Yeah?

33:34.544 --> 33:38.128
- Can I get up now?
- Are you gonna stop being an asshole?

33:38.498 --> 33:41.903
That's debatable. Yes. Yes.

34:01.204 --> 34:04.560
- What are you looking for?
- A loophole.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.464
It's my specialty.

34:07.844 --> 34:09.436
Yeah!

34:11.413 --> 34:14.704
I don't think they'd lock us up
in a room with working phones.

34:14.784 --> 34:16.472
I don't need a working phone.

34:16.552 --> 34:20.313
Just need bit of this, a bit of that.
Build a franken-phone.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.826
And call who? Cops can't enter the building.

34:23.476 --> 34:24.774
I'm not calling the cops.

34:24.853 --> 34:31.221
Sir? Derek Cho somehow managed to
set up a call with Vander Corp's CEO...

34:31.301 --> 34:33.393
...and they wanted you to join in.

34:36.356 --> 34:38.251
In a minute.

34:39.509 --> 34:42.632
Sorry to keep you waiting, Frank.
I'm all ears!

34:42.712 --> 34:44.418
<i>Glad you could join us, John.</i>

34:44.498 --> 34:48.271
<i>Well, I've been having a nice,
long chat with one of your lawyers.</i>

34:48.351 --> 34:52.007
- <i>You still there, Derek?</i>
- Yes, sir. I am still here.

34:52.088 --> 34:55.312
<i>Good. John, can you please remind me?</i>

34:55.391 --> 34:57.938
<i>Why do I do business with TSC?</i>

34:58.018 --> 35:00.350
Well, because it's a jungle out there, Frank.

35:00.430 --> 35:05.255
And not only do you need a guide, but you
also need a lion walking right by your side.

35:05.335 --> 35:08.625
And we are your lion and your guide.

35:08.705 --> 35:09.893
- <i>Are you?</i>
- Yeah.

35:09.973 --> 35:14.966
<i>Well, we're just a touch concerned
that you may have ulterior motives.</i>

35:16.246 --> 35:19.102
<i>We would never turn
against our clients, Frank.</i>

35:19.182 --> 35:23.927
<i>Well, that may be true, but Derek has
alerted me to a certain document...</i>

35:24.007 --> 35:27.074
<i>...that seems to suggest otherwise.</i>

35:27.374 --> 35:30.380
It's a report that TSC did for Vander Corp.

35:30.460 --> 35:33.750
It analyzes the advisability
of filing a multimillion-dollar lawsuit...

35:33.830 --> 35:36.096
...against one of Frank's
ex-business associates.

35:36.176 --> 35:38.788
<i>Do you remember this report, John?</i>

35:39.168 --> 35:42.516
- No.
- <i>I must say, it's well-written.</i>

35:42.596 --> 35:46.430
<i>I like how it weighs the slim possibility...</i>

35:46.510 --> 35:49.022
<i>...of a positive financial outcome...</i>

35:49.102 --> 35:53.820
<i>...against the enormous
potential litigation costs.</i>

35:53.900 --> 35:56.339
<i>Do you agree with this report, Derek?</i>

35:57.319 --> 36:00.444
No, sir. I do not. I believe
you could have won the suit.

36:00.524 --> 36:04.214
<i>Then why did your advisers
advise me against it?</i>

36:04.294 --> 36:07.791
<i>Your advisers missed
the deadline to file the motion.</i>

36:07.871 --> 36:11.337
<i>So you believe that TSC
dropped the ball on this one?</i>

36:11.417 --> 36:13.957
<i>I believe they dropped the ball, sir.</i>

36:14.037 --> 36:16.723
<i>But then they also defecated on the ball...</i>

36:16.803 --> 36:20.230
...and then sodomized the ball, sir.

36:20.710 --> 36:22.283
<i>Interesting.</i>

36:22.912 --> 36:24.774
<i>Oh, and, John...</i>

36:24.854 --> 36:28.325
<i>...I just happen to have
your last invoice here with me.</i>

36:36.593 --> 36:38.564
That went well.

36:41.163 --> 36:43.487
I want you to rip the fucking
phone out of his hands...

36:43.567 --> 36:46.777
...his hands off his fucking body now!

36:53.176 --> 36:57.100
Yeah. Can I please order two
pepperoni pizzas and some hot wings?

36:57.180 --> 37:00.236
Yeah. Why not?
Throw some garlic bread in there.

37:00.316 --> 37:02.542
Do you guys want anything?

37:22.656 --> 37:25.899
Brenda! This fucking phone doesn't work!

37:35.585 --> 37:37.107
Yeah.

37:37.687 --> 37:41.064
Christ, man! He fuck your girl, too?

37:42.998 --> 37:45.982
Damn, suit,
you don't even respect each other.

37:46.062 --> 37:47.893
You're right.

37:49.465 --> 37:51.307
We don't.

37:53.336 --> 37:55.038
Now what?

38:03.980 --> 38:05.909
Time to go to work.

38:28.004 --> 38:30.760
- Fuck, yeah!
- Oh, shit.

38:30.840 --> 38:34.484
They started a countdown for the
quarantine, posted in an interoffice app.

38:34.564 --> 38:37.367
It's enough time to get the job done.
I mean, this place isn't that big.

38:37.447 --> 38:41.104
The Boss is a fucking raging cokehead.
There's definitely gonna be more guards.

38:41.184 --> 38:42.456
Fine. I'll bring more nails.

38:42.536 --> 38:45.742
The only way to the top floor is with
the key card or a one-time password.

38:45.822 --> 38:47.917
So who do we have to fuck up to get the card?

38:47.997 --> 38:52.716
First, there's an ass-hat on the sixth
floor who's got a level-two key card.

38:52.796 --> 38:55.685
<i>It can take us to the seventh floor,
giving us access to the bitch...</i>

38:55.765 --> 38:57.867
...who's got a level-three key card.

39:06.055 --> 39:07.869
Hey, extreme measures, right?

39:46.182 --> 39:48.271
- Wednesdays.
- Hey!

39:51.254 --> 39:54.147
- Him?
- Yep.

40:01.564 --> 40:02.956
Hey!

40:09.272 --> 40:12.328
- Open the fucking door!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!

40:12.408 --> 40:14.931
You open doors like my grandmother fucks!

40:15.011 --> 40:16.903
Open the door!

40:20.683 --> 40:22.712
Open the fucking door!

40:22.792 --> 40:24.821
Open the door!

41:10.199 --> 41:13.822
It really bothers me that women don't
get the same treatment as men...

41:13.902 --> 41:15.865
...in the workplace.

41:16.472 --> 41:19.345
I'm all about gender equality here.

41:23.296 --> 41:24.871
Derek!

42:00.083 --> 42:02.742
- Need a hand?
- I don't need your help, suit.

42:02.822 --> 42:05.608
- But I need yours.
- Fuck you.

42:05.688 --> 42:07.547
Fuck you, too.

42:12.562 --> 42:15.184
- May we come in?
- And if I said no?

42:15.264 --> 42:17.787
You'll have to confer with my associate.

42:17.867 --> 42:20.760
And mine, gimpy.

42:26.642 --> 42:28.464
- What do you want?
- Key card.

42:28.544 --> 42:31.067
I'm not the only one
with a level-two key card.

42:31.147 --> 42:34.838
But you are the one that fired me, asshole!

42:34.918 --> 42:39.322
Wrong. The firm fired you.
Don't nail-gun the messenger.

42:41.824 --> 42:43.713
Oh, my God.

42:44.093 --> 42:46.616
You bring up a very good point.

42:46.696 --> 42:49.218
I'm so sorry, Lester. We're good.

42:49.298 --> 42:51.554
We're totally good, man.

42:51.934 --> 42:53.990
I will take it up with the firm...

42:54.070 --> 42:57.794
...but I would love to know
where I could find the firm...

42:57.874 --> 43:02.098
...because I would love
to kick the firm's ass.

43:02.178 --> 43:05.268
You can't kick a firm's ass.

43:05.681 --> 43:07.503
That's the point.

43:08.183 --> 43:12.277
Well, then that brings us back to you.

43:14.057 --> 43:16.149
I was just doing my job.

43:17.260 --> 43:19.950
No one raindrop thinks it caused the flood.

43:20.530 --> 43:22.352
I get what that means.

43:22.432 --> 43:25.418
You know what will happen to me
if I give you this key card?

43:25.498 --> 43:28.358
I'm going to have to file that under "N..."

43:29.238 --> 43:31.619
...for "not my fucking problem."

43:41.751 --> 43:43.276
Fuck!

43:50.559 --> 43:53.182
No! The saw!

43:53.262 --> 43:55.151
Extreme measures!

43:55.231 --> 43:56.853
Go!

44:14.717 --> 44:16.575
A little help?

44:26.662 --> 44:28.451
You ready?

44:28.531 --> 44:30.386
It's gonna hurt a lot.

44:30.666 --> 44:32.688
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

44:32.768 --> 44:35.358
- You're still one of them.
- I thought we were a team.

44:35.438 --> 44:39.298
For the time being.
All right. On the count of...

44:43.796 --> 44:45.834
All right. Calm down.

44:46.123 --> 44:47.707
Fuck.

44:48.184 --> 44:51.494
At least you're not that guy.
Move aside, pussies. Come on.

44:52.254 --> 44:54.500
Wait. Wait. I have an idea.

45:04.132 --> 45:07.823
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
You're cool! Fuck you!

45:07.903 --> 45:11.381
- Are we done here yet?
- We are now.

45:13.391 --> 45:16.832
Here, take my phone.
I need you to film something.

45:18.681 --> 45:21.504
- Film what?
- <i>Okay. Here we go.</i>

45:21.984 --> 45:26.783
<i>Case file 32376, The People vs. Reed.</i>

45:27.473 --> 45:29.378
<i>Now, you all know the court case...</i>

45:29.458 --> 45:33.149
<i>...but let's discuss Mr. Nevil Reed
the man, shall we?</i>

45:33.229 --> 45:38.221
<i>By all accounts, Mr. Reed was
an upstanding pillar of the community...</i>

45:38.301 --> 45:41.451
<i>...earned two master's degrees
by the age of 21.</i>

45:41.531 --> 45:46.362
<i>He married his college sweetheart
and is the father of beautiful twin girls.</i>

45:46.642 --> 45:51.491
But when Mr. Reed contracted the ID-7 virus...

45:51.571 --> 45:53.372
...shit got real.

45:54.650 --> 45:57.273
"Overwhelmed by pure id...

45:57.353 --> 46:00.543
...Nevil Reed became prone to involuntary...

46:00.623 --> 46:04.047
...aberrant, and shocking impulses.

46:04.127 --> 46:07.467
He committed a gruesome, unspeakable act...

46:07.547 --> 46:12.729
...in broad daylight
in a room full of witnesses."

46:13.369 --> 46:18.375
<i>Now, we're witnessing a model citizen here...</i>

46:18.874 --> 46:21.998
<i>...transformed into a brutal...</i>

46:22.078 --> 46:25.401
...bloodthirsty killing machine...

46:25.481 --> 46:28.738
...at the blink of an infected eye.

46:29.318 --> 46:31.174
So I ask you this.

46:31.754 --> 46:35.448
Is it his fault or is it the virus's?

46:41.429 --> 46:43.298
Let's discuss.

46:44.367 --> 46:46.209
See you soon, fuckers.

46:52.240 --> 46:53.996
Shit.

46:55.244 --> 46:58.367
Kara, he's on his way up.
He has got Lester's key card.

46:58.447 --> 47:02.105
<i>Oh, really? That's a shame,
a real shame, sir.</i>

47:02.585 --> 47:07.076
Just wondering, did they get it before or
after butchering Lester with an electric saw?

47:07.156 --> 47:10.299
Just calm down and come up here!

47:10.379 --> 47:13.716
They're guarding the private elevator.
I can't leave the office.

47:13.796 --> 47:17.620
- Then destroy the card.
- It's my only leverage.

47:17.700 --> 47:19.979
Kara, I promise you...

47:20.059 --> 47:24.057
<i>...I will do everything in my power
to ensure he doesn't get to you.</i>

47:24.137 --> 47:27.777
But if he does,
you must protect those above you.

47:27.857 --> 47:29.155
Fuck those above me!

47:29.235 --> 47:32.201
- I'll give you the raise you always wanted.
- Fuck your raise!

47:32.981 --> 47:36.047
- I'll make you partner.
- Fuck your...

47:36.393 --> 47:39.232
Deal. I'll throw it out the window.

47:39.312 --> 47:41.195
Oh, thank you.

47:51.637 --> 47:52.959
Meg!

47:55.704 --> 47:58.994
Hide this somewhere safe
and don't tell me where.

47:59.074 --> 48:01.884
And make more fucking coffee now!

48:01.964 --> 48:03.703
Stupid bitch.

48:09.952 --> 48:13.482
The elevator's the only way upstairs.
We can ambush her here.

48:13.562 --> 48:15.633
Well, it's gonna be a while.

48:17.293 --> 48:19.282
Top three bands, go.

48:19.362 --> 48:22.051
- Only three?
- Only three, that's the rules.

48:22.131 --> 48:23.987
All right.

48:24.417 --> 48:26.239
Motorhead.

48:26.319 --> 48:30.499
D.R.I. and Early Anthrax.

48:30.579 --> 48:33.028
- Metal till I fucking puke.
- All right. Okay.

48:33.108 --> 48:35.906
That's not what I expected, but fine choices.

48:35.986 --> 48:38.501
What did you expect, the Dave Matthews Band?

48:38.581 --> 48:40.870
Hey, Dave Matthews Band is actually...

48:40.950 --> 48:43.672
Other way, asshole. Go.
Turn around. Yep. You got it.

48:43.752 --> 48:46.776
- You fucking dick, Joe!
- What?

48:46.856 --> 48:49.445
Dave Matthews Band is a good band.

48:49.525 --> 48:52.081
- Oh, my God.
- You ever heard them live?

48:52.161 --> 48:55.184
I would rather chew glass.

48:55.264 --> 48:56.285
Are you serious?

48:56.365 --> 49:00.489
Just because they're popular
doesn't mean that they're bad at music.

49:00.569 --> 49:04.059
I think it's actually that people think
it's more popular to dislike them...

49:04.139 --> 49:06.065
...so they're just trying
to be cool. It's bullshit.

49:06.145 --> 49:07.863
All right. Fine.
I'll go see them at Burning Man.

49:07.943 --> 49:11.306
All right, make fun all you want,
but if we ever get out of here...

49:11.386 --> 49:15.337
...I'm gonna get us tickets, all right,
to the coliseum show in July.

49:15.417 --> 49:18.294
I'm gonna take you there and I'm gonna
turn you on to some great musicianship.

49:18.374 --> 49:23.216
You're gonna turn me on? Before or
after we go out to buy birkenstocks?

49:23.296 --> 49:25.848
- Fuck off.
- Do you wear them with socks? I bet you do.

49:25.928 --> 49:28.517
Okay. So... so just tell me again...

49:28.597 --> 49:32.355
...why you can't send a unit in
to just stop this asshole.

49:32.435 --> 49:35.591
<i>A heavily armed SWAT team
in a building filled with civilians...</i>

49:35.671 --> 49:38.994
<i>...infected with the virus
would be catastrophic.</i>

49:39.074 --> 49:43.565
<i>...for that, we need to...
excuse me. What are you doing?</i>

49:43.645 --> 49:46.936
Allergies. Who are you, my fucking therapist?

49:47.016 --> 49:49.862
<i>Anyway, all we can do
is talk to the employee...</i>

49:49.942 --> 49:52.375
<i>...in an attempt to defuse the situation.</i>

49:52.455 --> 49:54.477
<i>We currently have a psychologist on-site...</i>

49:54.557 --> 49:57.150
<i>...who could possibly talk
to the infected individual.</i>

50:01.330 --> 50:06.575
Notify the team down in accounting.
I'm offering 150 grand for Cho's head.

50:06.955 --> 50:09.142
You're talking about murder here.

50:09.572 --> 50:12.054
You should be offering at least 450.

50:12.134 --> 50:13.566
Agreed.

50:31.193 --> 50:34.267
Four hours left till the quarantine lifts.
We're running out of time.

50:34.397 --> 50:38.521
Well, sometimes you gotta say,
"what the fuck?

50:38.601 --> 50:40.807
- Make your move."
- "Risky business."

50:40.887 --> 50:42.459
Yeah.

50:43.439 --> 50:45.314
All right.

52:07.856 --> 52:12.515
<i>Hello, Derek? My name's Mark.
I'm a psychologist working with the CDC.</i>

52:12.595 --> 52:15.217
- <i>Can you hear me?
</i>- Yes, he can hear you, Mark.

52:15.297 --> 52:18.020
<i>I was just told that you were
under a bit of stress right now...</i>

52:18.100 --> 52:21.149
<i>...so I wanted to check in on you.
Can we talk?</i>

52:21.549 --> 52:23.611
<i>Can you tell me how you feel?</i>

52:25.905 --> 52:27.763
How do I feel?

52:29.822 --> 52:33.232
I feel like taking my clothes off.

52:33.312 --> 52:37.228
I feel like causing extraordinary amounts...

52:37.308 --> 52:40.345
...of property damage.
I feel like I wanna scream.

52:40.425 --> 52:45.048
I wanna fuck. I feel like
twisting limbs and breaking bones!

52:46.328 --> 52:49.952
- I feel great, Mark.
- <i>That's the virus talking.</i>

52:50.032 --> 52:53.689
I agree, Mark.
Derek isn't thinking clearly right now.

52:53.769 --> 52:57.264
He's so consumed by his id
that he hasn't noticed that...

52:57.344 --> 53:00.496
- ...we're just here to help him.
- <i>You should listen to her, Derek.</i>

53:00.576 --> 53:03.833
<i>Why don't you sit down,
take a breath, and talk it out?</i>

53:04.413 --> 53:06.271
Talk it out.

53:15.157 --> 53:16.745
Sure.

53:17.325 --> 53:21.717
- I'll talk it out.
- <i>Yeah. Let's just have a conversation.</i>

53:21.797 --> 53:23.655
Track three.

53:28.293 --> 53:31.133
Better not be fucking Dave Matthews Band.

53:32.257 --> 53:33.796
Okay.

53:34.176 --> 53:38.501
Those of you who don't wanna
be a part of this can leave now.

53:38.581 --> 53:42.037
- <i>Derek, please listen to me.</i>
- But if you choose to stay...

53:42.117 --> 53:44.777
...which it seems
like you guys are choosing...

53:44.857 --> 53:47.743
- <i>Derek, please.
</i>- ...you understand and agree...

53:47.823 --> 53:49.878
...to the following terms and conditions.

53:49.958 --> 53:51.780
- <i>Derek!</i>
- One...

53:51.860 --> 53:54.483
- <i>Derek, this is the virus talking.</i>
- ...you hereby waive your right...

53:54.563 --> 53:57.186
- <i>Derek, please.</i>
- ...to your own personal bodily integrity.

53:57.266 --> 53:59.321
- <i>This is not you.</i>
- Two...

53:59.401 --> 54:02.297
- <i>I'm a licensed psychologist.
</i>- ...per the State vs. Nevil Reed...

54:02.377 --> 54:05.294
...my colleague and I
will not be held criminally liable...

54:05.374 --> 54:09.131
...for any felony or misdemeanor
that you may be a victim of...

54:09.211 --> 54:13.669
<i>...including but not limited
to aggravated assault...</i>

54:13.749 --> 54:16.672
...aggravated battery, disorderly conduct...

54:16.752 --> 54:21.216
...destruction of property, mayhem,
and first-degree murder.

54:21.296 --> 54:22.926
And, three...

54:23.760 --> 54:27.990
...terms and conditions
may change or be updated...

54:28.070 --> 54:30.519
...whenever the fuck I want!

54:32.635 --> 54:35.998
Consider yourselves notified.

55:54.616 --> 55:56.171
<i>Hello?</i>

55:57.051 --> 55:58.607
<i>Derek?</i>

55:59.287 --> 56:00.530
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

56:01.690 --> 56:03.614
Knock, knock.

56:10.165 --> 56:11.917
Key card, <i>por favor.</i>

56:13.602 --> 56:16.432
If you want it, you'll have to negotiate.

56:17.272 --> 56:20.162
Negotiations have ended.

56:20.242 --> 56:24.396
Well, so will the quarantine,
and I don't know where the key card is.

56:26.081 --> 56:28.770
- What do you want?
- A truce.

56:29.430 --> 56:31.373
Fuck your truce.

56:31.453 --> 56:34.296
No truce, no key card.

56:36.892 --> 56:38.717
All right.

56:40.795 --> 56:43.888
Tell me where it is, and I promise...

56:43.968 --> 56:46.425
...I'll be on my way and leave you alone.

56:48.586 --> 56:50.991
You're a man of your word, Derek.

56:52.407 --> 56:54.831
That's why I believe you.

56:56.111 --> 56:59.371
And that's... that's why
you never made partner.

57:00.048 --> 57:03.338
Key card. Key card, Derek.

57:03.758 --> 57:05.611
Don't be stupid now.

57:08.891 --> 57:11.563
There's a good boy. Meg!

57:11.643 --> 57:13.484
Yeah, Meg!

57:20.168 --> 57:22.574
Take your key card, Derek, and fuck off.

57:22.904 --> 57:24.760
What card?

57:25.240 --> 57:29.082
All I see is a useless piece
of scorched plastic on the table.

57:30.279 --> 57:31.808
Strange.

57:32.607 --> 57:35.396
Me too. Is that what you see, too, Meg?

57:35.476 --> 57:38.607
- Yep.
- So tell me, Meg, sweetie...

57:38.687 --> 57:43.932
...why did you bring me this useless
piece of plastic instead of my key card?

57:44.012 --> 57:47.249
Oh, that is your key card,
or it used to be...

57:47.329 --> 57:50.152
...before I put it inside a microwave oven.

57:50.232 --> 57:52.496
And why would you do that, I wonder?

57:54.036 --> 57:58.494
You're exactly like
every other assistant, Meg.

57:58.974 --> 58:03.432
You're a vapid, bottom-feeding,
parasitic shithead!

58:03.912 --> 58:07.826
You're a pair of tits with zero talent.

58:07.906 --> 58:10.906
So tell me, Meg, you incompetent cunt...

58:10.986 --> 58:14.413
...what could possibly possess you
to destroy my key card?

58:14.493 --> 58:17.713
Because everyone upstairs
knew you would betray them.

58:17.793 --> 58:21.884
So they offered me a promotion
in exchange for destroying the card.

58:21.964 --> 58:23.352
So...

58:23.432 --> 58:27.676
...I guess I no longer work for you,
you fucking bitch.

58:28.186 --> 58:31.794
In fact, I don't have to listen...

58:31.874 --> 58:36.571
...to your hideous, shrill voice ever again!

58:36.651 --> 58:39.157
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

58:57.531 --> 59:01.336
Now it's a party! Oh, my God! Yes!

59:01.416 --> 59:04.293
<i>Hey, just wanted to say...</i>

59:04.373 --> 59:08.067
<i>...no more lies, no more power games...</i>

59:10.644 --> 59:12.501
<i>...no more bullshit...</i>

59:12.981 --> 59:14.506
<i>...and...</i>

59:15.447 --> 59:17.228
<i>...no more siren song.</i>

59:18.752 --> 59:23.559
<i>By the way, Meg, she's a little crazy.</i>

59:24.393 --> 59:26.250
<i>She's perfect here.</i>

59:37.939 --> 59:40.362
Dude, that freak show had
some super-good-quality shoes.

59:40.442 --> 59:42.429
These are comfy as fuck!

59:44.029 --> 59:45.836
I loved this mug.

59:53.554 --> 59:57.922
I got it on the first day
that I started here.

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.185
My sister gave it to me.

01:00:07.402 --> 01:00:09.194
Fuck this place.

01:00:13.758 --> 01:00:15.769
Do you still have that...

01:00:16.425 --> 01:00:18.640
...foreclosure paperwork on you?

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:20.872
Yeah.

01:00:24.552 --> 01:00:27.779
- Why?
- Let me take a little look at it.

01:00:35.464 --> 01:00:36.986
What?

01:00:38.466 --> 01:00:40.323
You're in luck.

01:00:41.503 --> 01:00:43.759
This mortgage is part of a bad batch.

01:00:44.239 --> 01:00:48.730
Original paperwork was filed so many
times that it'd be tough to find.

01:00:49.215 --> 01:00:51.033
Could even be lost.

01:00:51.713 --> 01:00:54.269
So if I ask the bank
for the original paperwork...

01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:56.241
You'd put them in a tough spot.

01:00:59.521 --> 01:01:04.379
Or a signature from upstairs
could void it completely.

01:01:04.759 --> 01:01:06.317
Really?

01:01:09.965 --> 01:01:12.098
Hey, I'm sorry...

01:01:12.178 --> 01:01:15.793
...for not helping you earlier.

01:01:17.272 --> 01:01:20.530
I should've, but I didn't.

01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:23.465
It's okay.

01:01:23.945 --> 01:01:25.822
Just don't do it again, I guess.

01:01:34.923 --> 01:01:36.812
<i>You rolling?</i>

01:01:37.792 --> 01:01:40.215
<i>Push back. Push back.</i>

01:01:40.495 --> 01:01:42.385
<i>All right. Stop.</i>

01:01:43.265 --> 01:01:45.096
<i>Can you see him?</i>

01:01:49.571 --> 01:01:51.160
No.

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:53.632
<i>Fuck you, Derek.</i>

01:01:59.547 --> 01:02:01.402
Is that your friend?

01:02:01.482 --> 01:02:03.372
Oh, God.

01:02:04.252 --> 01:02:06.109
Hey, give that to me.

01:02:07.389 --> 01:02:10.415
Hey. Hey, it's all right.

01:02:13.328 --> 01:02:15.386
He has kids.

01:02:19.934 --> 01:02:22.357
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

01:02:22.737 --> 01:02:24.627
I'm sorry.

01:02:25.207 --> 01:02:27.395
This fucking virus, it just takes...

01:02:27.475 --> 01:02:30.099
...just takes everything up to 11.

01:02:30.879 --> 01:02:32.871
I've noticed.

01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:35.907
Hey.

01:03:43.618 --> 01:03:45.774
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

01:03:45.854 --> 01:03:48.276
- I like this virus.
- Yeah.

01:03:48.356 --> 01:03:50.244
So what now?

01:03:51.224 --> 01:03:53.481
I think we should definitely
exchange numbers...

01:03:53.561 --> 01:03:55.950
...consider an apartment, maybe a dog.

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:58.920
- That'd be nice.
- No, you idiot! What now?

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.193
Let's see.

01:04:05.906 --> 01:04:09.531
- Ray sent an update to the office staff.
- Who's Ray?

01:04:09.611 --> 01:04:11.469
He's the IT guy.

01:04:12.447 --> 01:04:14.036
Fuckers.

01:04:14.516 --> 01:04:16.805
There must be another way
we can get up there.

01:04:16.885 --> 01:04:18.766
Not without the key card.

01:04:20.588 --> 01:04:22.111
Unless...

01:04:23.391 --> 01:04:26.081
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:04:26.961 --> 01:04:28.466
Unless what?

01:04:29.096 --> 01:04:30.759
What's he want?

01:04:30.839 --> 01:04:34.492
Ray can't fix the elevators,
but I have another idea.

01:04:38.373 --> 01:04:41.730
- Ray!
- I'm really busy right now!

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:45.429
Goddamn it! Fuck you!
Why won't you fucking work?

01:04:45.509 --> 01:04:46.954
Ray!

01:04:48.416 --> 01:04:50.238
Hey.

01:04:50.518 --> 01:04:52.807
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:04:52.887 --> 01:04:54.710
We need your help.

01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:57.812
Holy shit! How'd that happen?

01:04:57.892 --> 01:05:01.149
Well, we asked for his help,
and then he said he was busy.

01:05:01.229 --> 01:05:02.798
Really?

01:05:03.097 --> 01:05:04.679
Welcome to IT.

01:05:05.433 --> 01:05:07.289
We need you to hack into someone's computer.

01:05:07.369 --> 01:05:11.261
And I need Interpol to get off my back,
so what else is fucking new?

01:05:13.441 --> 01:05:16.254
- Who we talking about?
- Irene Smythe.

01:05:16.334 --> 01:05:17.754
Oh, fuck her.

01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:24.302
What? What the...

01:05:28.756 --> 01:05:31.546
- IT department.
- <i>What's wrong with my computer?</i>

01:05:31.626 --> 01:05:34.012
Doctor can't do much
until you tell him where it hurts.

01:05:34.092 --> 01:05:37.482
My Internet is slower than your brain.

01:05:37.562 --> 01:05:42.040
Well, that's a miracle considering the budget
that I have for installs and updates.

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:46.269
<i>Seriously, how do you expect me to keep
running things if you have one guy...</i>

01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:49.681
<i>...in one room down in the fucking
basement doing everything?</i>

01:05:49.761 --> 01:05:54.139
<i>Seriously, and what do I get? I get
denial, denial, denial, denial, denial...</i>

01:05:54.219 --> 01:05:58.523
<i>...on all my fucking budgets, right?
But, "oh, Ray, please give me an app!</i>

01:05:58.603 --> 01:06:00.491
- <i>Make sure..."</i>
- I am shocked!

01:06:00.571 --> 01:06:03.094
I'm shocked and appalled, and
I'll definitely bring this up with John...

01:06:03.174 --> 01:06:05.830
<i>...but in the meantime,
can you do your fucking job?</i>

01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:09.000
Cool your bloomers. Hold on.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.303
- Just sent you a patch.
- A patch?

01:06:11.383 --> 01:06:15.994
It's a file that you install on that thing
in front of you called a computer.

01:06:16.274 --> 01:06:17.316
Okay.

01:06:17.396 --> 01:06:21.152
Look, this might get complicated
for you, but don't worry.

01:06:21.232 --> 01:06:23.738
I'll take you through the whole
process myself. You ready?

01:06:23.818 --> 01:06:24.849
Okay.

01:06:24.929 --> 01:06:26.918
<i>Click on the file that's on your desktop.</i>

01:06:26.998 --> 01:06:30.660
- Done.
- Now click "install."

01:06:33.905 --> 01:06:36.794
So rude. You know...

01:06:37.386 --> 01:06:41.235
...funny enough, I think
the virus actually made her nicer.

01:06:43.414 --> 01:06:47.572
I could've called that file mean Trojan
destroyer, the ultimate hard drive rapist...

01:06:47.652 --> 01:06:49.714
...and she still would have installed it.

01:06:51.022 --> 01:06:53.128
And we're in.

01:06:53.858 --> 01:06:56.681
Okay. So what we're looking at,
those are her files?

01:06:56.761 --> 01:06:59.584
Every last one of them, even the porn.

01:06:59.664 --> 01:07:02.721
Seems she's got a thing for feet.
What do you want?

01:07:02.801 --> 01:07:05.857
I want you to pretend
that that is a peaceful village...

01:07:05.937 --> 01:07:08.460
...inhabited by gorgeous virgin maidens.

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:13.799
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and you're the...
you know, smelly, aggressive viking king.

01:07:14.679 --> 01:07:16.754
You had me at peaceful.

01:07:19.056 --> 01:07:20.941
What... what the...

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:26.010
Ray, you ignoramus,
that patch thing has erased my hard drive.

01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:31.129
<i>Hey, Irene. I got good news,
bad news, and worse news for you.</i>

01:07:31.209 --> 01:07:34.979
Good news is, is we have a copy
of your hard drive on the backup server.

01:07:35.059 --> 01:07:38.370
Bad news is that I have it.

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:42.027
Worse news is that, if you want it...

01:07:42.107 --> 01:07:44.733
...you gotta come down and get it.

01:07:47.851 --> 01:07:51.072
- What trade?
- The backup copy for my key card.

01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:56.207
That backup is worth millions to this firm.
Are you actually listening to me?

01:07:56.287 --> 01:07:58.343
I'm meeting him. End of story.

01:07:58.423 --> 01:08:01.446
Oh, great. Should I just remove
my pants now...

01:08:01.526 --> 01:08:04.282
...to make it easier for him
when he comes up here to fuck me?

01:08:04.362 --> 01:08:07.295
I'm not going to give him my key card.

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:09.153
Well, he has got leverage against you.

01:08:09.233 --> 01:08:12.901
The idiot let me decide on the meeting spot.

01:08:17.341 --> 01:08:19.413
Where's your piece, Colton?

01:08:51.742 --> 01:08:54.631
- All right. She's clean.
- Who is she?

01:08:54.712 --> 01:08:56.667
She's one of the mortgage
accounts that you...

01:08:56.747 --> 01:09:00.304
I'm Melanie Cross.
I live at 22nd and Pacific.

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:03.319
Not for long.

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:04.946
Just...

01:09:06.689 --> 01:09:08.390
Key card.

01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:09.810
Files.

01:09:20.304 --> 01:09:22.175
Are you...

01:09:22.464 --> 01:09:25.095
- ...looking for this?
- Okay.

01:09:25.893 --> 01:09:27.231
Just a little pro tip.

01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:31.877
Employees' IQs at this firm are inversely
proportionate to their salaries, so...

01:09:31.957 --> 01:09:36.228
...it's probably not a good idea to try to
outsmart someone with a smaller paycheck.

01:09:37.388 --> 01:09:39.279
Key card.

01:09:47.163 --> 01:09:50.310
Now give me the hard drive. I've done my bit.

01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:51.673
Not yet.

01:09:53.371 --> 01:09:55.460
Gotta sign this first.

01:10:02.539 --> 01:10:04.697
I could sign this, sure...

01:10:04.777 --> 01:10:08.339
...then claim temporary insanity
and have it dismissed.

01:10:08.419 --> 01:10:10.141
Sorry, sweetie...

01:10:11.190 --> 01:10:13.681
...but you can always take it
to the man upstairs...

01:10:13.761 --> 01:10:16.541
...with that card you've got if you like.

01:10:26.037 --> 01:10:27.875
You fucking whore!

01:10:27.955 --> 01:10:31.048
- Give us a minute.
- Yeah, totally.

01:11:26.364 --> 01:11:28.166
Bullets are for cowards.

01:11:28.246 --> 01:11:30.315
Oh, shit.

01:11:39.931 --> 01:11:41.899
No, no, wait!

01:11:41.979 --> 01:11:45.039
That card doesn't work.
It needs an access code.

01:12:14.313 --> 01:12:16.735
I got it. No.

01:12:17.249 --> 01:12:20.805
No! No, no! No!

01:12:21.235 --> 01:12:23.261
I'm gonna burn your eyes out.

01:13:08.099 --> 01:13:10.789
I am done fucking around.

01:13:11.169 --> 01:13:13.057
Give us the code right now.

01:13:13.237 --> 01:13:17.095
I'll give you the code,
but here's the new deal, boy.

01:13:17.175 --> 01:13:18.630
- You give me her.
- What?

01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:22.600
She destroyed my work. That's years of my
life. You want your revenge? Give me mine.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.770
I just want my home back, you asshole!

01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:28.540
The quarantine is ending soon.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:32.326
- Your time is running out.
- Give me the access code!

01:13:32.656 --> 01:13:34.612
I'll give you a pro tip.

01:13:34.692 --> 01:13:36.748
You want to swim to the top?

01:13:36.828 --> 01:13:38.716
Drop the dead weight.

01:13:39.196 --> 01:13:41.055
She'll do it.

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.723
Five!

01:13:45.803 --> 01:13:47.361
Four!

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.365
Three.

01:13:55.263 --> 01:13:57.335
- Two!
- One.

01:13:58.315 --> 01:13:59.857
Deal.

01:14:02.019 --> 01:14:04.896
Fuck you, Derek, you piece-of-shit suit!

01:14:05.456 --> 01:14:08.345
You're just like all of them!
You belong here!

01:14:09.085 --> 01:14:10.615
Fuck!

01:14:11.095 --> 01:14:12.560
Done?

01:14:16.326 --> 01:14:18.289
Fuck you! Fuck you.

01:14:18.369 --> 01:14:20.827
I'll be back shortly, sweetie.

01:14:21.211 --> 01:14:23.038
Come on.

01:14:52.169 --> 01:14:54.192
These things only work once.

01:14:54.662 --> 01:14:56.730
Don't do anything stupid.

01:15:36.881 --> 01:15:38.487
<i>Can you see it, Derek?</i>

01:15:39.901 --> 01:15:43.146
<i>Can you see the solution to our problem here?</i>

01:15:47.425 --> 01:15:50.268
<i>You're infected. You have impunity!</i>

01:15:50.628 --> 01:15:54.642
<i>Nevil Reed, he got away with murder.
Maybe I can have a little fun here.</i>

01:15:57.301 --> 01:15:59.327
<i>Well, I'm gonna beat you to the punch.</i>

01:16:06.377 --> 01:16:08.082
<i>Let's discuss.</i>

01:16:37.007 --> 01:16:39.786
- What's that?
- The terms of my surrender...

01:16:39.866 --> 01:16:41.668
...partnership contract.

01:16:45.883 --> 01:16:48.539
You're a fucking piece of shit.

01:16:48.619 --> 01:16:52.393
Look, my guy killed your guy.
You killed my guy, so we're even.

01:16:52.473 --> 01:16:54.778
Let's just get down to business now?

01:16:54.858 --> 01:16:56.399
Ladies.

01:16:57.678 --> 01:17:01.121
Monthly profit participation,
annual performance bonus...

01:17:01.201 --> 01:17:06.624
...vehicle allowances, gas,
maintenance, insurance, chauffeur.

01:17:06.704 --> 01:17:10.795
Expense accounts, full cellphone allowances...

01:17:10.925 --> 01:17:13.894
...paid parking, country-club fees.

01:17:13.974 --> 01:17:16.407
I've seen you admiring all of this, Derek.

01:17:18.731 --> 01:17:21.210
Isn't this what you've always wanted?

01:17:21.635 --> 01:17:22.723
Yes.

01:17:22.803 --> 01:17:26.247
Then why don't I see
a fucking pen in your hand?

01:17:27.474 --> 01:17:31.618
Do you really wanna spend the next 20
years of your life working your ass off...

01:17:31.698 --> 01:17:35.003
...for what, maybe half
of what I just offered you?

01:17:35.483 --> 01:17:37.505
Sign it, Derek.

01:17:37.985 --> 01:17:40.291
Sign it, and I'll suck your cock.

01:17:40.371 --> 01:17:42.309
Sign it, and I'll help.

01:17:42.389 --> 01:17:45.416
- Be smart.
- Be rich.

01:17:58.572 --> 01:18:00.130
No.

01:18:31.295 --> 01:18:33.144
Mine's bigger.

01:18:33.727 --> 01:18:35.799
Mine's always bigger.

01:18:45.102 --> 01:18:46.774
You fucker.

01:18:53.926 --> 01:18:56.170
That's your problem, Derek. No vision.

01:19:04.672 --> 01:19:06.497
Fuck you.

01:19:13.397 --> 01:19:15.299
Fuck! Iron!

01:19:18.985 --> 01:19:21.711
No, not the 9, the 5!

01:19:40.641 --> 01:19:42.396
Look at your partners.

01:19:42.476 --> 01:19:44.566
Look at your partners!

01:19:45.346 --> 01:19:47.384
You know what they're thinking right now?

01:19:47.464 --> 01:19:52.172
They're thinking how big their piece of the
pie is gonna get once you stop taking yours.

01:19:53.287 --> 01:19:55.676
This is where we vote, right?

01:19:55.756 --> 01:19:58.883
Well, then let's vote. Make it quick.

01:20:14.175 --> 01:20:16.048
Can you do it, Derek?

01:20:16.853 --> 01:20:18.699
Can you do it?

01:20:18.779 --> 01:20:22.041
No, because you're too much of a pussy,
which is why I'm up here...

01:20:22.121 --> 01:20:24.338
...and you are down there.

01:20:24.418 --> 01:20:26.773
But when this is all over...

01:20:26.853 --> 01:20:29.679
...I will piss on your corpse, as well.

01:20:56.684 --> 01:20:59.000
<i>And so the king falls.</i>

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:02.843
<i>With the quarantine about to lift,
I finally gotta plead my case to The Nine...</i>

01:21:02.923 --> 01:21:06.948
<i>...excuse me, Eight...
and have my own day in court.</i>

01:21:07.528 --> 01:21:11.468
<i>Surprisingly, given the fact that I just
threw their former CEO off a balcony...</i>

01:21:11.548 --> 01:21:13.805
<i>...they seemed pretty willing to listen.</i>

01:21:14.955 --> 01:21:18.525
<i>In a calm and collected manner,
I explained to them my situation...</i>

01:21:18.605 --> 01:21:21.528
<i>...my dedication to the firm,
the abuse of company resources...</i>

01:21:21.608 --> 01:21:23.764
<i>...by those above my pay grade, yada yada.</i>

01:21:23.844 --> 01:21:25.999
<i>I don't need to bore you
with the long-form version.</i>

01:21:26.079 --> 01:21:29.370
<i>With a sound defense and in light
of the day's events, I pled that...</i>

01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:31.822
I think I deserve my job back.

01:21:33.404 --> 01:21:36.197
<i>But as they voted, it dawned on me...</i>

01:21:36.277 --> 01:21:39.363
<i>...something my sister had been
trying to tell me for years...</i>

01:21:39.443 --> 01:21:42.206
<i>...what my new friend reminded me today.</i>

01:21:42.996 --> 01:21:44.956
<i>I didn't have a job.</i>

01:21:45.036 --> 01:21:46.816
<i>The job had me.</i>

01:21:46.896 --> 01:21:49.791
<i>I was just another
fucking slave to the grind.</i>

01:21:50.421 --> 01:21:54.528
<i>Look, we paint our paths
with the best of intentions...</i>

01:21:54.608 --> 01:21:58.386
<i>...but at the end of the day, sometimes
it takes a brushstroke of circumstance...</i>

01:21:59.596 --> 01:22:03.640
<i>...or a deadly virus to set us
on the right path again.</i>

01:22:07.975 --> 01:22:10.644
<i>And the incident at TSC,
as they're calling it...</i>

01:22:10.724 --> 01:22:13.814
<i>...ended up being a watershed case
to finally accelerate a vaccine...</i>

01:22:13.894 --> 01:22:16.347
<i>...to prevent the symptoms
of the ID-7 virus...</i>

01:22:16.427 --> 01:22:19.153
<i>...pending FDA approval, of course.</i>

01:22:19.233 --> 01:22:21.989
<i>You're welcome. And for the firm itself...</i>

01:22:22.069 --> 01:22:25.359
<i>...well, they did what any corporate
asshole in a corner would do.</i>

01:22:25.439 --> 01:22:27.995
<i>They offered me Towers' job.</i>

01:22:28.075 --> 01:22:30.951
<i>Finally a seat at the big kids' table.</i>

01:22:50.731 --> 01:22:53.956
<i>So I took the gig...</i>

01:22:55.536 --> 01:22:59.563
<i>...just long enough to make an executive
decision and do some good in the world.</i>

01:23:09.461 --> 01:23:10.968
I quit.

01:23:11.218 --> 01:23:12.653
<i>Now, I know what you're thinking.</i>

01:23:12.733 --> 01:23:14.775
<i>We wrapped this story up
in a nice little bow...</i>

01:23:14.855 --> 01:23:19.053
<i>...and we pretty much just killed
a bunch of people. I live with that.</i>

01:23:19.133 --> 01:23:22.499
<i>But they do say everything
happens for a reason.</i>

01:23:22.579 --> 01:23:24.618
<i>I'm starting to believe it.</i>

01:23:24.698 --> 01:23:28.512
<i>Here's one more pro tip.
Paint your own path to success...</i>

01:23:28.592 --> 01:23:30.955
<i>...in work, love, and life...</i>

01:23:33.957 --> 01:23:36.287
<i>...before it's too fucking late.</i>
