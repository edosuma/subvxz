Traitor.

you'll have to do to me, too.

The Fool Moon may be
making her moody.

01:57.784 --> 02:01.412
Plus, I also think she might
be having some witch-ues.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.831
- What are witch-ues?

02:02.914 --> 02:08.627
- You know, how the young ones
say, "Oh, she got issues."

02:08.711 --> 02:10.380
- Okay.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.881
So what are her witch-ues?

02:11.965 --> 02:15.552
- Mainly that we have our first
powerless witch on the Council

02:15.635 --> 02:17.679
and that the magic realm
will lose all respect

02:17.762 --> 02:20.056
for our authority because of it.

02:20.139 --> 02:22.976
- Being on the Council
isn't about having powers.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.728
It's about being
a fair and decent judge.

02:25.812 --> 02:29.732
- Well, yes, clearly
you and Desdemona disagree

02:29.816 --> 02:31.901
with our most recent judgment.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.571
- You know, I don't know
what's gotten into Emma.

02:34.654 --> 02:35.864

her lesson

02:52.589 --> 02:53.923
That wasn't very nice.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.426

How was your trip?

02:57.176 --> 02:59.095
- It was awesome.

02:59.178 --> 03:01.180
I've always wanted
to visit Siberia.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.265
- Emma, this isn't funny.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.267

03:04.350 --> 03:07.770
You're more powerful

I didn't mean that.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.948
I can't control myself either.

03:20.658 --> 03:23.703
Like just now, I cast
a couple of spells on you.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.288

03:25.371 --> 03:26.664
You were just stuffing
your face with French toast.

03:26.748 --> 03:30.460

- Wait, what spells
did you cast on me?

03:32.962 --> 03:35.340
- Ohhh, look at the time.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.880
Look, if you got your hand
stuck to something else,

04:15.964 --> 04:17.382
you are on your own.

04:17.464 --> 04:20.677
- No, I'm here to see Maddie.
She texted me to come over.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.887
- Well, I suppose if Maddie
invited you, it's all right,

04:22.971 --> 04:25.723
but be a dear, try not
to touch anything.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.100
The last thing I want is to walk
back in here and find

04:27.183 --> 04:29.352
a Kanay stuck to my curtains.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.188
I hate it when that happens.

04:32.271 --> 04:33.314
- Now!

the game or whatever this is?

05:06.014 --> 05:07.557
- Diego,
what are you doing here?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.559

said it was urgent.

05:09.642 --> 05:13.563
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did, look.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.897

pink ones only."

05:30.121 --> 05:31.456

05:36.335 --> 05:37.545

05:37.628 --> 05:38.212
You called Proxy?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.298
- No.
- Yes.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.508

over to attack him?

05:42.592 --> 05:44.052

- No--yeah.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.178
- Katie, explain.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.013
- We were just going to hide
him for a while

05:47.096 --> 05:49.182
until you started hanging
out with us again.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.017
- You attacked Proxy

05:51.100 --> 05:54.145
just to get my attention?

05:54.228 --> 05:57.398
- Yes.
- Oh, that's so sweet.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.985
- It is?
I mean, it is.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.945
- You'll still be punished,
of course,

06:03.029 --> 06:05.573
but you shouldn't be jealous
of Proxy.

I mean, they belong to the team.

- You're a soccer player, too?
- Yeah, forward.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.182
- I was the best forward
at my last school.

06:31.265 --> 06:34.977
- Oh. We made nationals
two years in a row.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.189
- I scored the most goals out
of everybody at my last school.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.983
- Well, I average a goal
per game and two assists.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.402
- In the season final,
the goalie got injured,

06:43.486 --> 06:46.781
so I played goalie
and defense at the same time.

06:46.864 --> 06:50.284

varsity team in the third grade.

our trophy in the case.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.249
- Would you be careful?

06:56.332 --> 06:56.999
You were gonna break
the whole thing.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.544

06:59.627 --> 07:02.380
- 'Cause you know what they
say, you break it, you buy it.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.343
- I don't know what happened.
I didn't even touch it.

07:07.426 --> 07:08.010
- You must have shook something
loose when you rammed

07:08.094 --> 07:09.846
into it before.

07:09.929 --> 07:13.474
- [stammers] I didn't even
barely touch it that time.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.184
- Are you saying I'm blind?

07:15.268 --> 07:18.521
Then I'm saying you've
got detention--one week.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.940
- But I still have three
weeks left from the last time.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.192
- Not detention.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.945
I want you to participate
in...

07:26.028 --> 07:28.739
the school play.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.532
- What?

07:29.615 --> 07:31.284
- Did I just say "school play"?

07:31.367 --> 07:32.034
- You can't be serious.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.953

And you better be good.

- Don't worry, Daniel.
I'll take care of this.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.593
- Agamemnon's lucky I have
my powers under control,

07:48.676 --> 07:52.138
otherwise he could be
lettuce right now.

07:52.221 --> 07:53.681
- Lettuce?

07:53.764 --> 07:57.727
- Hey, I'm still kind of new
at this wild and tough thing.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.395
- Did he tell you what
spells he cast on you?

07:59.478 --> 08:00.855
- No.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.899
But I think he was just saying
that to try and scare me.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.026
Too bad it didn't work.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.528
They messed
with the wrong Chosen One.

08:07.612 --> 08:08.738
- Okay, if you're gonna keep
trying to do this,

08:08.821 --> 08:09.906
you might as well do it right.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.991
Watch me.
[clears throat]

08:12.074 --> 08:15.244
Nice try, Witches Council.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.579
- Nice try, Witches Council.

08:16.662 --> 08:19.290
- What about
the Witches Council?

08:19.373 --> 08:21.375
- None of your business.

08:21.459 --> 08:24.003
- Did you drink, like, eight
cups of coffee this morning?

08:24.086 --> 08:25.755
- I don't need coffee
to get amped up.

08:25.838 --> 08:29.383
This is just my natural energy.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.595
- I told the Council I'm
not breaking up with Daniel.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.013
They didn't take my powers away.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.681
- No way.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.267
- Agamemnon said he cast spells
on me to teach me lesson,

08:38.351 --> 08:39.977
but he was bluffing.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.438
- Congratulations.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.607
Now you're gonna have to
teach me some of your skills.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.525
- She's not teaching
you anything.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.612
- Now, Andi, is that any way
to talk to your newest Shark.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.700
- What did you do to her?

08:54.784 --> 08:57.286
- Me?
I didn't do anything.

08:57.370 --> 09:01.457
- You are so <i> not</i>
Shark material.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.417
What is wrong with you?

09:03.501 --> 09:04.710
- I-I don't know.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.762
- How am I gonna trap Emma
and get her to cast a spell

09:14.845 --> 09:17.306
if I can hardly stand
to be around her?

09:17.390 --> 09:18.975
- You could invite her over?

09:19.058 --> 09:20.685
You guys could talk
and work things out?

09:20.768 --> 09:24.105
- Yes, but how do I lure her
to my house?

09:24.188 --> 09:25.690
- You're making all
my suggestions sound evil.

09:25.773 --> 09:28.985

book of hers,

09:29.068 --> 09:32.280
the Honk-honk-gagrin.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.281
- What?

09:33.364 --> 09:34.198
Oh, you mean the Hexoren.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.409
- That's what I said.

09:36.492 --> 09:37.326
- Or how about not commit
felony burglary

09:37.410 --> 09:39.870
and just invite her over?

09:39.954 --> 09:41.831
Do whatever you Panthers do.

09:41.914 --> 09:45.459
- Us, Panthers...
Hmm, what we do.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.169
Rule the school, dump smoothies
on people we don't like,

09:47.253 --> 09:50.006
have epic sleepovers.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.842
[gasps]
That's it--a sleepover.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.094
- Yeah, there you go.
That's a great idea.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.887
Call Emma and have her--
- Hello?

09:56.971 --> 09:57.555
Mother?

09:57.638 --> 09:59.849
- Or call your mom?

09:59.932 --> 10:01.684
- I need you here, stat.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.520
- And have her
come to the school?

10:11.277 --> 10:14.238
- Okay, what is going on?
- I don't know.

10:14.322 --> 10:17.241
Suddenly I get these impulses
to dance, and I can't fight it.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.868
- It's like when people get
hypnotized

10:18.951 --> 10:20.161
and a word acts as a trigger.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.829
- Huh?

10:21.912 --> 10:23.706
- Like this one time, my dad
got hypnotized at a magic show,

10:23.789 --> 10:25.916
and every time someone
said the word "tomato,"

10:26.000 --> 10:27.752
he'd start doing, like,
frog jumps--

10:27.835 --> 10:29.462
- Okay, okay,
so what did we say

10:29.545 --> 10:31.922
right before
you started dancing?

10:32.006 --> 10:33.507
- That was
an embarrassing month.

10:33.591 --> 10:34.842
- Andi, think.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.386
- Um, okay,
the first time, you said...

10:37.470 --> 10:38.554
[British accent]
"Is that any way

10:38.637 --> 10:41.057
to talk
to your newest Shark?"

10:41.140 --> 10:42.391
- Yeah, and the second time,
you said...

10:42.475 --> 10:43.851
[imitating Andi]
"You are so not Shark material."

10:43.934 --> 10:45.227
- [normal voice]
I don't sound like that.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.228
- Yeah, you do.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.689
- Wait, "Shark."
It must be "Shark."

10:48.773 --> 10:49.940
- Stop saying it.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.401
- Saying what--Shark?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.570
[both laughing]

10:56.530 --> 10:58.282
- I feel like I just competed
in a whole season of

10:58.366 --> 11:00.910
"So You Think You're America's
Next Top American Dancer."

11:00.993 --> 11:02.370
- That's it.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.955
That must be the spell
that Agamemnon cast on you.

11:05.039 --> 11:08.292
- Oh, that sneaky wizard.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.669
They'll have to do more than
that to get me to back down.

11:10.753 --> 11:11.796
- Yeah.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.923
Besides, I mean,
how often do people say "Shark"?

11:14.006 --> 11:16.801
[both laughing]

11:19.970 --> 11:21.639
- I heard that kid
Jax beat the Sharks.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.099
I hope he's a good swimmer.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.558
- Aah!

11:24.642 --> 11:27.311
- Emma, um, are you okay?

11:27.395 --> 11:29.814
- Oh, yeah.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.900
- Uh, you won't believe
what just happened.

11:32.983 --> 11:35.611
Your dad made me sign up
for the school play.

11:35.694 --> 11:38.280
- Oh, yeah.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.199
- It starts next week.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.410
Rehearsals are the same time
as Shark practice.

11:42.493 --> 11:45.037
- Oh, yeah.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.163
- What are you doing?

11:46.247 --> 11:48.249
- [sighs]

11:48.332 --> 11:50.084
Aah!

11:56.382 --> 11:59.635
- Greetings,
Grand Duke of Iridium High.

11:59.718 --> 12:03.556
Tis I, Ursula Van Pelt,
who has come hither.

12:03.639 --> 12:05.099
- Ursula...
[chuckles nervously]

12:05.182 --> 12:06.809
Hi.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.352
Do we have an appointment, or do
I need to call security again?

12:08.436 --> 12:10.896
- Oh, no, no, no need.

12:10.980 --> 12:14.400
I called to let them
know I was coming.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.986
Wouldn't want to violate
that restraining order...

12:17.069 --> 12:18.821
again.

12:18.904 --> 12:25.494
Um, actually, I am--
I'm here on business.

12:25.578 --> 12:30.708
It's Maddie.
She's--she's not doing well.

12:30.791 --> 12:34.295
[crying]

12:36.088 --> 12:38.215
- She's not?

12:38.299 --> 12:42.595
- [crying]

12:50.686 --> 12:53.606
- [sighs]
- Hey, Emma, I--

12:53.689 --> 12:56.150
- Relax, it's just me.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.777
I saw the new video
on Gigi's blog.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.488
I guess the Council
cast more spells on you

13:00.571 --> 13:02.781
than you thought, huh?

13:02.865 --> 13:03.824
Yes.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.326
And unless I find out
which ones,

13:05.409 --> 13:07.244
I'm never going out
in public again.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.954
- Well, we figured out
the first one,

13:09.038 --> 13:10.998
so we can figure out the rest.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.375
- Do we really
have to watch this?

13:13.459 --> 13:16.170
It was embarrassing enough
living it the first time.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.964
- The first time you shriek
is when you see Daniel.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.549
The second time you shriek
is when you turn

13:20.633 --> 13:21.967
and look at Daniel.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.260
- You're right.
And what about my...

13:23.344 --> 13:25.387
"Oh, yeahs"?

13:25.471 --> 13:29.558
- Oh, don't you
mean your, "Oh, yeah"?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.060
- Way to kick me when I'm down.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.311
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.813
But you got to admit,
it's pretty funny.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.273
<i>DANIEL ON VIDEO: Your dad made</i>
<i>me sign up...</i>

13:36.357 --> 13:38.567
- Um...
<i>EMMA ON VIDEO: Oh, yeah.</i>

13:38.651 --> 13:41.529
- Daniel says something.
You respond, "Oh, yeah."

13:41.612 --> 13:44.532
Daniel says something else,
you response, "Oh, yeah," again.

13:44.615 --> 13:45.824
<i>DANIEL ON VIDEO:</i>
<i>It starts next week.</i>

13:45.908 --> 13:48.202
Did you respond, "Oh, yeah,"
to anyone else today?

13:48.285 --> 13:49.411
- No.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.914
- Then that must be it.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.541
They're trying to make you act
crazy around Daniel

13:53.624 --> 13:54.250
so you won't want to be
around him.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.502
- What?

13:56.585 --> 13:57.920
That's not going to
keep me away from him.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.046
<i>DANIEL ON VIDEO: He made the</i>
<i>rehersals at the same...</i>

13:59.129 --> 14:00.422
- Are you sure about that?

14:00.506 --> 14:02.007
<i>EMMA ON VIDEO:</i>
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

14:07.721 --> 14:08.597
- Thank you.
Come again.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.558
We're, uh, about to close.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.434
Can I do anything else for you?

14:14.353 --> 14:14.937
Hey, guys.

14:17.773 --> 14:20.401
- You can stay away from Maddie.
That's what you can do.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.778
- And get me an orange soda.

14:22.861 --> 14:25.114
- Why are you wearing that?
- You heard us.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.532
- We want you
to stay away from Maddie.

14:26.615 --> 14:29.243
- And an orange soda.

14:29.326 --> 14:31.912
- Or we're going to have
to teach you a lesson.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.582
- Oh, no.
- What happened to your hand?

14:34.665 --> 14:37.376
- Are you turning into a chair?

14:37.459 --> 14:38.919
- He's attacking us!

14:39.003 --> 14:41.505
- No, I'm not attacking you!
- He's a shape-shifter!

14:41.589 --> 14:43.340
He might not even be
the real Diego.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.633
- Who are you?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.635
- Guys, it's me!

14:46.719 --> 14:48.971
- The real Diego
would never say that!

14:49.054 --> 14:51.599
[both screaming]
- It's okay.

14:51.682 --> 14:54.268
It's okay!
It's just a new power!

14:55.102 --> 14:56.604
- Run, Sophie, run!

14:56.687 --> 14:58.272
- Wait, no, don't go!

14:58.355 --> 15:00.441
Don't--
Ah, man!

15:00.524 --> 15:04.111
Okay, I can do this.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.618
- What are those?
- My dad's books.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.495
If there's any way to reverse
the Council's spells,

15:13.579 --> 15:14.580
it's in one of these.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.332
- Thanks,
but we got it covered.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.666
- Ah, sweet, the Hexoren.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.002
- Hey, I said
<i>we</i> got it covered.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.712
- You're not even a witch.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.589
- Yeah, but Hex and I
are homeys.

15:23.672 --> 15:25.174
Aren't we, Hex?

15:25.257 --> 15:26.967
- Guys, stop it.
[knocking at door]

15:27.051 --> 15:28.510
<i>DANIEL: Emma, it's me.</i>
<i>Can I come in?</i>

15:28.594 --> 15:30.596
- Oh, yeah.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.890
Oh, no, it's Daniel.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.767
He can't see
all these magic books.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.060
- You're not gonna
let him in, are you?

15:36.143 --> 15:37.645
You know what's gonna happen.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.980
- I can't just ignore him,
especially after I rebelled

15:40.064 --> 15:42.733
against the Council
to be with him, right?

15:42.816 --> 15:44.360
- Oh, yeah.
[laughs]

15:44.443 --> 15:46.528
- Not funny.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.030
Now hide.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.538
Aah!

15:56.622 --> 15:58.040
- What's going--

16:01.877 --> 16:03.295
- Thank you for coming.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.546
I didn't know who else to call.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.714
- Of course.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.675
You said there was free pizza.

16:07.758 --> 16:10.719
So what's the problem?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.054
Whoa.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.597
Has that ever happened
to you before?

16:13.681 --> 16:15.015
- A few times.

16:15.099 --> 16:19.895
- How did you get
unstuck those times?

16:19.978 --> 16:21.897
- One time I sang
"You're a Grand Old Flag."

16:21.980 --> 16:23.023
- And that worked?

16:23.107 --> 16:24.733
- Yeah,
but I already tried that.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.776
No dice.
- Oh.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.320
What about the other times?

16:28.404 --> 16:29.988
- The other times,
I calmed down,

16:30.072 --> 16:30.864
and I thought about fire.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.242
But I think that's the problem.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.411
I can't calm down
because I'm freaking out

16:35.494 --> 16:36.787
about somebody seeing this.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.372
- Okay.

16:38.455 --> 16:40.916
Let's take some deep breaths.

16:40.999 --> 16:45.546
[both breathe deeply]

16:45.629 --> 16:48.757
What, did you eat
an entire bag of onions?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.259
- Sorry.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.595
While I'm bored while
I'm working, I snack on them.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.472
- You snack on onions?

16:55.556 --> 16:57.516
- I won't from now on.
Promise.

16:57.599 --> 16:58.767
- Okay, let's try this again.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.937
Just blow that way.

17:02.020 --> 17:03.814
- Okay.

17:03.897 --> 17:07.776
[breathes deeply]

17:09.819 --> 17:11.613
- Whew!

17:13.198 --> 17:16.326
- Have you got the spell yet?
- Hang on.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.162
- Yes, here it is.

17:18.244 --> 17:19.997
- Okay, give it to me.
- No way.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.457
I'm not gonna let you
take all the credit.

17:21.540 --> 17:25.127
- Hello? You need someone with
magical powers to cast a spell.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.377
- Okay, fine.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.755
- Aah!

17:29.256 --> 17:31.967
- Hurry. Emma's about to
give herself a heart attack.

17:32.050 --> 17:33.886
- Oh, yeah.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.221
- Okay, okay, okay.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.515
The Witches Council,
fair and wise they may be,

17:38.599 --> 17:42.144
but from their punishment spells
may you be free.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.983
- Look, do I need to call
a doctor or something?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.943
- N-n-no.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.820
No!

17:51.904 --> 17:55.657
I had a really sore throat,

17:55.741 --> 17:57.076
and it was really hard
to control

17:57.159 --> 17:58.243
how my voice sounded.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.495
But I'm all better now.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.455
- But what about the dancing?

18:01.538 --> 18:03.248
- Oh, no, my dad's almost home.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.000
- Your dad?

18:05.083 --> 18:07.002
I got to go before he makes me
sign up for the spelling bee

18:07.086 --> 18:08.337
or something.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.256
- Like now?
- N-O-W now.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.090
- Okay, go, go.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.432
- [laughing]

18:20.516 --> 18:23.143
And then
Gigi ran home crying.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.853
- That's hilarious.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.688
- It taught her not
to steal my dump trucks

18:26.772 --> 18:29.149
and turn them into doll mobiles.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.777
- It's so cool
you have your own sundae bar.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.195
- It is cool...

18:33.278 --> 18:36.156
mm, until you eat
six bowls of ice cream

18:36.240 --> 18:38.992
with hot fudge,
caramel, and marshmallows

18:39.076 --> 18:41.995
and barely make it
to the bathroom.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.164
[chuckles]

18:44.248 --> 18:45.582
TMI?

18:46.959 --> 18:48.085
- Slow down, guys.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.837
You're gonna eat everything
in our fridge.

18:49.920 --> 18:50.963
- We were out there for so long,

18:51.046 --> 18:52.714
I thought we were
gonna starve to death.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.383
- You were out there
for five minutes.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.385
- Hey, we need
to fuel up, okay?

18:56.468 --> 18:59.429
We're...Sharks.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.558
- Nice. It looks like my spell
worked on all of them.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.184
- [sighs]

19:04.268 --> 19:06.103
I still think it's bogus
that you cheated at tryouts,

19:06.186 --> 19:10.691
but you did help
Emma out of a major jam.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.651
Maybe you aren't so bad.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.069
- Hey, maybe we could all--

19:14.153 --> 19:15.404
- Don't push it, Alonso.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.781
- Mm.

19:17.865 --> 19:21.451
I better not forget
to bring my dad's book back.

19:21.535 --> 19:25.414
Ah!

19:25.497 --> 19:26.957
- Bad Hex.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.423
- Now you've done it.

19:34.506 --> 19:39.428
- Since I am now able,
turn this into a party table.

19:42.014 --> 19:42.264
[sighs]

19:44.224 --> 19:47.436
I want these curtains
to disappear.

19:47.519 --> 19:48.729
Replace them with--

19:48.812 --> 19:52.274
- Maddie, you won't believe
what just ha--

19:52.357 --> 19:55.110
You--you have powers?

19:55.193 --> 19:57.446
- [stammering]

19:57.529 --> 19:59.281
Yes, yes, I have powers.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.616
- How did you get them?

20:00.699 --> 20:04.369
- Um, another witch
must have lost hers,

20:04.453 --> 20:05.954
and they just happened
to land on me.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.248
- Maddie's?
- Shoot.

20:08.332 --> 20:11.126
I was hoping
you'd gloss right over that.

20:11.209 --> 20:15.130
Yes, Sophie, they're Maddie's.

20:15.213 --> 20:16.089
- Then why don't you
give them back to her?

20:16.173 --> 20:18.634
She's miserable without them.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.303
- It's--it's for her own good.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.431
She's not responsible enough
to have them,

20:24.514 --> 20:29.645
so I'm holding on to them
for her for safe keeping

20:29.728 --> 20:31.855
until she's old enough.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.523
- But if you give them back now,

20:33.607 --> 20:35.484
she's can use magic
to steal your shoes

20:35.567 --> 20:37.319
instead of making me sneak
into your closet

20:37.402 --> 20:38.403
when you're sleeping.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.447
- What?

20:40.530 --> 20:43.575
Sophie, Sophie, it's okay.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.828
But, you know, you can't tell
Maddie I have her powers.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.081
- Then in the words
of your daughter,

20:49.164 --> 20:51.875
"What's in it for me?"

20:51.959 --> 20:55.671
- Wow, you really do
sound eerily like her.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.423
Uh, oh, okay, well...

20:58.507 --> 21:00.884
you do this favor for me, hmm?

21:00.968 --> 21:05.138
And I'll owe you a favor...

21:05.222 --> 21:05.847
someday.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.474
- Ooh, okay.

21:07.557 --> 21:10.352
Let me just record
this in my favor box.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.109
- Oh...

21:17.192 --> 21:19.361
I'm in trouble.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.740
- I'll clean up.
- That's okay. It's my turn.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.450
- No, no, no, I got it.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.828
You have more important things
to do, like scrapbooking,

21:27.911 --> 21:29.871
playing "Zombie Apocalypse,"

21:29.955 --> 21:32.457
or getting ready for
Maddie's surprise slumber party.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.542
- I'm gonna go get
my scrapbooking kit.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.670
- I'll set up
for "Zombie Apocalypse."

21:36.753 --> 21:39.047
BOTH: What?

21:39.131 --> 21:40.882
- Surprise.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.634
You're spending the night
at Maddie's house.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.345
BOTH: No!
