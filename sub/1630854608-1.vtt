20:03.953 --> 20:05.747
[Jack] During the Cold War,

20:05.830 --> 20:07.498
a small group
of hardline Russians

20:07.582 --> 20:09.751
formed a plan
to preserve the USSR.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.253
They called it
the Sokol Project.

20:12.337 --> 20:14.672
Now, that name actually
comes directly from

20:14.756 --> 20:17.842
a Russian war game called
Sem' dney do reki Reyn,

20:17.926 --> 20:19.552
or "Seven Days to the Rhine."

20:19.636 --> 20:21.679
Now, that plan

20:21.763 --> 20:24.015
was based on
a small wars doctrine.

20:24.098 --> 20:28.061
You sow unrest inside
your Eastern Bloc neighbors

20:28.144 --> 20:29.896
through assassinations
and misinformation

20:29.979 --> 20:32.148
in order to destabilize
those governments.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.150
Then,

20:34.233 --> 20:36.736
use a limited nuclear strike
to create chaos,

20:36.819 --> 20:38.738
that would allow
for a land invasion

20:38.821 --> 20:41.824
into these countries,
otherwise known as the Rhine.

20:41.908 --> 20:45.453
The goal was to hold and expand
the USSR's borders.

20:45.536 --> 20:46.871
To pull this off,
they needed to engineer

20:46.955 --> 20:48.206
a nuclear weapon to be used

20:48.289 --> 20:50.249
without attribution,
and they did,

20:50.333 --> 20:52.585
code name Sokol, or "Falcon."

20:52.669 --> 20:55.171
At the time, the technology
was too advanced,

20:55.254 --> 20:56.756
and the weapon was never made,

20:56.839 --> 20:59.133
so the project was shuttered,
or so we thought.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.344
Until last night, I have
confirmation from an asset

21:01.427 --> 21:03.429

is active.

21:19.028 --> 21:21.364

they intend to use

21:21.447 --> 21:23.032
inside the new Sokol missile.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.451
Thesis?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.621

they've built a weapon

21:28.705 --> 21:30.123

21:30.206 --> 21:31.874
Worst case, they've already

21:31.958 --> 21:33.960

of Seven Days to the Rhine,

21:34.043 --> 21:35.211
in which case,

21:35.294 --> 21:37.463
we can all expect
a lot of dominoes to fall,

21:37.547 --> 21:40.758

a new world conflict.
