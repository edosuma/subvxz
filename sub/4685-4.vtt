WEBVTT

00:06.925 --> 00:09.594
Hey, I'm drawing here!

00:12.221 --> 00:13.931
Zuri, that is

00:13.932 --> 00:15.641
a beautiful lion!

00:18.060 --> 00:19.374
Alien?

00:19.375 --> 00:20.688
Sasquatch?

00:22.481 --> 00:23.816
- Tell me if
- I'm getting warmer.

00:23.942 --> 00:24.942
It's you.

00:27.695 --> 00:28.695
Hmm.

00:29.864 --> 00:32.533
See, this is your hair.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.619
Oh. Last time

00:34.620 --> 00:36.579
I go to Quickie Cuts.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.311
Yeah, just because

00:38.312 --> 00:39.916
you get a coupon

00:40.040 --> 00:41.667
- doesn't mean
- you should use it.

00:44.587 --> 00:45.839
Up and back

00:45.840 --> 00:47.089
in 22 seconds.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.592
Beat that, Puke.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.887
The name's Luke.

00:53.012 --> 00:55.453
- Although the - view of your butt
- Did make me want to puke.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.392
Now watch and learn.

00:58.393 --> 00:59.560
I'm gonna climb this wall

00:59.685 --> 01:01.313
faster than

01:01.314 --> 01:02.939
a spider monkey

00:59.685 --> 01:02.939
on a sugar high.

01:03.147 --> 01:04.753
Uh, Luke, aren't you

01:04.754 --> 01:06.358
forgetting something?

01:06.484 --> 01:07.506
Oh, yeah.

01:07.507 --> 01:08.527
Trevor, let's put

01:06.484 --> 01:08.527
some money on this.

01:08.653 --> 01:09.758
No. No, no, no.

01:09.759 --> 01:10.863
I didn't mean gambling.

01:10.989 --> 01:12.824
- I was talking
- about a helmet.

01:12.949 --> 01:14.179
Jessie, I can't

01:14.180 --> 01:15.409
wear this!

01:15.534 --> 01:16.845
- Don't worry,
- I can fix the strap.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.142
No, I mean it's got

01:18.143 --> 01:19.413
a princess on it.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.019
- It's got a princess
- under it, too.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.857
Look, I am sorry,

01:24.858 --> 01:26.671
but safety comes first.

01:26.796 --> 01:27.940
- And hey, - I think you're getting
- A little sunburned,

01:27.964 --> 01:29.424
So let me just...

01:29.425 --> 01:30.883
No, I'm not...

01:31.009 --> 01:32.094
I'm fine

01:32.095 --> 01:33.177
and I'm going up.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.595
- Trevor,
- start timing me.

01:35.888 --> 01:38.266
Whoa, sunscreen.

01:38.267 --> 01:40.643
This is slippery.

01:40.768 --> 01:41.769
Whoa, falling!

01:41.894 --> 01:42.186
- (SCREAMS)
- I got you.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.188
Okay.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.170
You got

01:46.171 --> 01:47.441
20 more seconds.

01:47.566 --> 01:48.766
- Maybe she can
- carry you up.

01:48.860 --> 01:50.758
All right.

01:50.759 --> 01:52.655
All right, that's it!

01:52.780 --> 01:54.620
- We're going - to settle this
- Like real men.

01:54.699 --> 01:56.451
By playing paintball

01:56.452 --> 01:58.202
in weird costumes!

01:58.285 --> 01:59.475
You're on!

01:59.476 --> 02:00.663
Me and my brother, Dirk,

02:00.788 --> 02:01.788
are gonna be gladiators.

02:01.873 --> 02:04.209
And we're gonna

02:04.210 --> 02:06.544
feed you to the lions!

02:06.669 --> 02:08.253
Yeah?

02:08.255 --> 02:09.839
Well, my team's

02:06.669 --> 02:09.839
gonna be zombies!

02:09.964 --> 02:11.841
- And we're gonna
- eat your brains!

02:11.966 --> 02:13.759
- Yeah,
- if you had any!

02:14.802 --> 02:16.220
Up top!

02:16.261 --> 02:17.326
Sorry,

02:17.327 --> 02:18.389
but it's too dangerous.

02:18.514 --> 02:19.874
- I don't have
- a wrist protector.

03:59.323 --> 04:00.523
- Check your phone.
- I'm busy.

04:02.952 --> 04:04.805
- You scored us - two seats to Zac
- Posen's fashion show?

04:04.829 --> 04:06.331
Front row!

04:06.332 --> 04:07.832

Hello? We're talking

04:17.427 --> 04:18.843
Zac Posen.

04:18.968 --> 04:20.658

04:20.659 --> 04:22.346
will be all celebrities.

04:29.543 --> 04:31.147
our celebrity guest?

04:31.355 --> 04:33.149
Kenny the Koala

04:33.150 --> 04:34.942
is coming all the way

04:31.355 --> 04:34.942
from Luke's room.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.215
Don't you have

04:36.216 --> 04:37.361
something to finger paint?

04:39.780 --> 04:42.200
I'd finger paint your coat,

04:42.366 --> 04:43.534
but it just caught

04:43.535 --> 04:44.702
a cab to Brooklyn!

04:54.879 --> 04:56.422
So, think you can

04:56.423 --> 04:57.965
duck and roll like that?

05:00.134 --> 05:02.136
No.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.450
If I start rolling,

05:03.451 --> 05:04.638
I won't stop until

05:02.261 --> 05:04.638
I hit the duck pond.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.329
Come on, Bertram!

05:07.330 --> 05:08.684
I need a paintball partner,

05:08.809 --> 05:10.206
and you need

05:10.207 --> 05:11.603
someone to keep quiet

05:11.729 --> 05:13.889
- about what happened to
- Mom and Dad's wedding china.

05:14.857 --> 05:17.526
The lizard startled me.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.758
Whatever.

05:19.759 --> 05:21.864
The point is that gravy boat

05:17.651 --> 05:21.864
is never setting sail again.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.345
Come on, we've only

05:23.346 --> 05:24.700
got one day to practice

05:21.989 --> 05:24.700
before the competition.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.493
- Okay, what do
- I have to do?

05:26.618 --> 05:28.537
Well, the first rule

05:28.538 --> 05:30.455
of paintball is to have

05:26.618 --> 05:30.455
a good hiding place.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.124
So, survey

05:32.125 --> 05:33.667
the terrain carefully,

05:30.581 --> 05:33.667
and find the perfect spot.

05:33.792 --> 05:34.793
Now go!

05:35.711 --> 05:36.712
Go, go, go, go, go!

05:42.676 --> 05:44.595
Really? You're exposed.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.764
(GASPS) Oh, dear.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.933
(ZIPPER CLOSING)

05:49.058 --> 05:50.935
Hey, Puke!

05:51.060 --> 05:52.103
Don't even

05:52.104 --> 05:53.145
bother practicing,

05:53.271 --> 05:55.544
'cause my brother Dirk

05:55.545 --> 05:57.816
and I are gonna pound you

05:53.271 --> 05:57.816
like a chicken cutlet.

05:57.942 --> 05:59.402
Wow. Dirk had

05:59.403 --> 06:00.861
a growth spurt.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.571
Yeah, he beefed up.

06:02.572 --> 06:04.156
In prison.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.725
Does he know

06:09.726 --> 06:10.788
you can just

06:08.660 --> 06:10.788
twist the top off?

06:15.042 --> 06:16.856
Does your partner know

06:16.857 --> 06:18.670
he needs a bigger lamppost?

06:20.923 --> 06:22.007
(SCREAMS)

06:22.133 --> 06:24.635
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no!

06:27.263 --> 06:29.140

06:39.984 --> 06:41.277
If you'll excuse me,

06:41.278 --> 06:42.569
I'm off to clean up

06:39.984 --> 06:42.569
before dinner.

06:42.694 --> 06:43.737
We're having salmon.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.572
Ugh, I hate salmon.

06:45.697 --> 06:46.697
I know!

06:48.784 --> 06:50.870
Great.

06:50.871 --> 06:52.955
When Bertram cooks angry,

06:48.784 --> 06:52.955
no one wins.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.349
- I still haven't
- passed that marble

06:54.373 --> 06:56.438
That somehow "wound up"

06:56.439 --> 06:58.502
in my mashed potatoes.

06:58.627 --> 06:59.712
Meanwhile,

06:59.713 --> 07:00.796
I still need a partner.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.423
You know, my dad

07:02.424 --> 07:03.924
taught me how to

07:00.921 --> 07:03.924
field-strip an AK-47

07:04.049 --> 07:05.884
- when I was
- in third grade.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.470
FYI, that'll win you

07:07.471 --> 07:08.929
the school talent

07:06.010 --> 07:08.929
show every time.

07:11.349 --> 07:12.704
I need a partner

07:12.705 --> 07:14.059
with cat-like agility.

07:14.185 --> 07:15.269
Really?

07:16.812 --> 07:18.252
- Got a hankering
- for some walnuts.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.325
And they also need

07:29.326 --> 07:30.951
to be really strong.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.411
Gee, these walnuts

07:32.412 --> 07:33.745
are still in their shells.

07:33.871 --> 07:34.330
(CRUNCHING)

07:34.538 --> 07:36.248
Oh, thanks.

07:38.209 --> 07:39.961
But where am I gonna

07:39.962 --> 07:41.712
find someone like that?

07:41.837 --> 07:43.277
Oh, for the love

07:43.278 --> 07:44.715
of fudge, pick me!

07:44.840 --> 07:46.488
What? You want me

07:46.489 --> 07:48.135
to go into combat against

07:44.840 --> 07:48.135
Trevor with my nanny?

07:48.260 --> 07:49.637
(SCOFFS) Haven't you

07:49.638 --> 07:51.013
embarrassed me enough?

07:51.138 --> 07:52.348
I wasn't trying

07:52.349 --> 07:53.557
to embarrass you.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.830
I was trying

07:54.831 --> 07:56.018
to keep you from

07:53.640 --> 07:56.018
getting a boo-boo!

07:56.143 --> 07:57.166
Quit babying me.

07:57.167 --> 07:58.187
If I show up with you,

07:58.312 --> 08:00.232
- I might as well just
- wear a diaper and a bib!

08:02.024 --> 08:03.734
- But then you
- would catch cold!

08:03.859 --> 08:05.194
- Oh, see,
- I did it again.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.410
Bertram, I'm inviting you

08:13.411 --> 08:14.995
to my tea party tomorrow.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.019
Oh, thank you,

08:17.020 --> 08:18.916
but tomorrow I have to

08:19.041 --> 08:20.460
check to see if

08:20.461 --> 08:21.877
the cheese has gone bad.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.590
But you have to come.

08:26.673 --> 08:27.779
Emma ditched me

08:27.780 --> 08:28.884
for Jasmine Epstein!

08:29.009 --> 08:31.136
Ugh. Jasmine.

08:31.262 --> 08:32.888
- You know what
- the other butlers say,

08:33.013 --> 08:34.722
- That she's
- a horrible gossip.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.392
- But you didn't
- hear it from me.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.062
My lips are sealed.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.543
So you're gonna come

08:41.544 --> 08:42.898
to my tea party, right?

08:44.358 --> 08:45.359
No!

08:47.319 --> 08:49.280

Okay, okay, okay!

With lungs like that,

09:02.231 --> 09:04.044

09:19.978 --> 09:21.937
"bottom of the barrel" means,

09:22.062 --> 09:23.147
but thank you

09:23.148 --> 09:24.231
for choosing me

09:22.062 --> 09:24.231
as your partner.

Great.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.114
to disappoint me

09:39.371 --> 09:40.623
Just, uh,

09:40.624 --> 09:41.873
stay down, and cover me.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.501
I am here

09:43.502 --> 09:45.002
for you, brother!

- If you're still cold,
- I can buy you a warm drink.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.844
- Drink vendor,
- over here, my good man.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.142
- Bertram,
- can I ask your advice?

10:00.267 --> 10:01.953
- Yes, I think - you should give up
- On your dreams

10:01.977 --> 10:03.000
And move

10:03.001 --> 10:04.021
back to Oklahoma.

10:12.321 --> 10:13.614
but he won't let me help him

10:13.615 --> 10:14.906
because he thinks

10:12.321 --> 10:14.906
I'll embarrass him.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.658
Why would he think that?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.931
Well, I may have

10:18.932 --> 10:21.079
kind of embarrassed him.

10:22.999 --> 10:24.791
Did you roll into

10:21.205 --> 10:24.791
the duck pond, too?

10:24.916 --> 10:26.001
No, but there was

10:26.002 --> 10:27.085
an incident involving

10:24.916 --> 10:27.085
a pink bicycle helmet,

10:27.211 --> 10:28.630
some sunscreen,

10:28.631 --> 10:30.047
and I may have

10:30.172 --> 10:32.253
- kind of cradled him
- in my arms. Blah, blah, blah.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.886
- The point is
- I know I can help him,

10:36.011 --> 10:36.720
- But he doesn't
- want me there.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.930
So what should I do?

10:39.056 --> 10:40.432
Do what I do.

10:40.558 --> 10:42.101
Hide in the pantry

10:42.102 --> 10:43.643
and pretend to

10:40.558 --> 10:43.643
inspect cheese?

10:43.768 --> 10:45.479
And count the days

10:45.480 --> 10:47.189
till all the kids

10:43.768 --> 10:47.189
are off to college.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.315
Or in Luke's case,

10:48.316 --> 10:49.316
a correctional facility.

10:51.527 --> 10:52.653
Well, when the going

10:52.654 --> 10:53.778
gets tough,

me in the pantry with

10:53.904 --> 10:56.281

10:56.407 --> 10:58.388
I'm gonna go help Luke,

10:58.389 --> 11:00.369
and this time, I won't

10:56.407 --> 11:00.369
embarrass him.

11:00.494 --> 11:01.995
- Should I bring him
- a juice box?

11:02.120 --> 11:03.852
No.

11:03.853 --> 11:05.583
And for the record,

11:05.749 --> 11:06.959
you'll never see me

11:06.960 --> 11:08.168

11:37.364 --> 11:39.450

- you're miserable?

11:55.382 --> 11:56.675
- I'm wedged
- into a toy chair,

11:56.800 --> 11:58.427
My boa is molting,

11:58.552 --> 12:00.492
and this tiara

is cutting off the

17:46.380 --> 17:47.400
to be a guy?

17:47.525 --> 17:48.736
Hey, I'm only

17:48.737 --> 17:49.945
wearing this getup

17:50.153 --> 17:50.988
- because you ditched
- your little sister.

17:51.154 --> 17:52.343
Yeah, well,

17:52.344 --> 17:53.531
Jasmine just ditched me.

17:53.657 --> 17:54.866
(GASPS) Fantastic!

17:54.992 --> 17:56.618
I mean, aw,

17:56.619 --> 17:58.244
that's too bad.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.728
You know what

18:01.729 --> 18:03.166
makes me feel better

18:00.288 --> 18:03.166
when I'm feeling down?

18:03.291 --> 18:04.584
A tea party

18:04.585 --> 18:05.877
with a burping lizard.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.588
Zuri's really mad at me.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.069
She probably doesn't

18:10.070 --> 18:11.424
want me around.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.301
I don't know.

18:13.302 --> 18:15.053
She set a place for you

18:15.178 --> 18:16.614
- and she didn't let
- anyone else sit there.

18:16.638 --> 18:19.182
Really?

18:19.307 --> 18:20.493
- Not even
- Millie the Mermaid?

18:20.517 --> 18:22.268
Nope. Go have fun.

18:26.023 --> 18:27.899
- In the meantime,
- I'm going to attempt

18:28.025 --> 18:29.484
- To pry this chair
- off my butt.

18:39.202 --> 18:40.307
This is awesome!

18:40.308 --> 18:41.412
I can smell victory!

18:41.538 --> 18:43.138
- Now let's finish this!
- Lock and load!

18:50.463 --> 18:51.464
Mummies, three o'clock!

18:55.010 --> 18:56.553
- Run home
- to Daddy, mummies!

18:56.678 --> 18:58.638
To the mushrooms!

19:03.060 --> 19:04.415
Hey, Puke!

19:04.416 --> 19:05.770
Looks like it's

19:03.060 --> 19:05.770
just you and us!

19:05.896 --> 19:08.398
Get ready to eat paint!

19:10.400 --> 19:12.027
- We don't eat paint!
- We serve it!

19:12.235 --> 19:13.475
- With a side
- of butt-kicking!

19:13.570 --> 19:15.238
- A la mode!
- With sprinkles!

19:15.321 --> 19:16.948
Okay, we're done now.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.243
Let's do this, partner.

19:50.273 --> 19:51.775
Hey, Trevor,

19:51.776 --> 19:53.276
prepare to get puked!

19:55.612 --> 19:56.612
(TRIGGER CLICKING)

20:00.951 --> 20:03.536
Ugh. Epic fail!

20:04.621 --> 20:06.853
Yeah! That's right!

20:06.854 --> 20:09.084
You've just been nannified!

20:10.043 --> 20:12.295
(AIR HORN BLASTS)

20:12.420 --> 20:14.380
- Game over.
- You won!

20:15.423 --> 20:16.674
No, we won.

20:18.009 --> 20:19.761
Jessie, Luke,

20:19.762 --> 20:21.512
I am so proud.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.319
- While you were
- fighting for your lives,

20:23.431 --> 20:24.658
- I ran to the
- teacher supply store

20:24.682 --> 20:26.080
To pick up these

20:26.081 --> 20:27.477
congratulatory stickers.

20:27.602 --> 20:28.602
"Great job!"

20:30.521 --> 20:32.065
"You are a star!"

20:32.190 --> 20:33.233
And see, it is

20:33.234 --> 20:34.275
shaped like a star!

20:36.069 --> 20:37.320
Thanks, Ravi.

20:37.445 --> 20:38.446
Come on, guys.

20:38.447 --> 20:39.447
Let's go home.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.179
Oh, hey, Trevor!

20:41.180 --> 20:42.784
Put on some sunscreen!

20:47.246 --> 20:48.874
Hi, Zuri.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.500
Is there room for me

20:47.246 --> 20:50.500
at your tea party?

20:50.625 --> 20:51.898
I thought you said

20:51.899 --> 20:53.170
it was kid stuff.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.817
And aren't you

20:54.818 --> 20:56.339
supposed to be

20:53.294 --> 20:56.339
at the fashion show?

20:56.464 --> 20:57.966
Well,

20:57.967 --> 20:59.467
I thought about it,

20:56.464 --> 20:59.467
but then I realized

20:59.592 --> 21:01.654
- it was more important - to spend time
- With my little sister.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.054
Mmm-hmm?

21:06.099 --> 21:07.789
Okay, okay.

21:07.790 --> 21:09.477
Jasmine dumped me.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.562
Chubby the bear called it.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.397
- I owe you
- five bucks, Chubs.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.068
So, can I sit down?

21:17.735 --> 21:20.071
Sure.

21:20.197 --> 21:21.823
Millie, I told you

21:21.824 --> 21:23.449
that seat was reserved!

21:26.661 --> 21:28.955
Excuse the scales.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.080
No problem.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.209
Cupcake?

21:32.375 --> 21:33.376
Don't mind if I do.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.401
Mmm, these

21:37.402 --> 21:39.257
are scrumptious.

21:39.382 --> 21:41.218
- Thank you.
- I added a dash of glitter.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.973
By the way,

21:46.974 --> 21:48.516
I threw Jasmine's

21:45.429 --> 21:48.516
jacket off the terrace.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.186
Oh, well done!

21:51.394 --> 21:53.954
- After tea, let's go - throw her shoes
- Down the garbage chute.

21:54.814 --> 21:55.814
Why wait?

21:58.693 --> 21:59.693
(BURPS)
