00:19.520 --> 00:20.453
Have a nice day.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.487
I'll do that.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.154
Definitely.

00:40.487 --> 00:41.953
You got to be kidding me.

00:42.650 --> 00:43.650
Unbelievable.

00:44.518 --> 00:46.750
Your machine ate my card.

00:46.817 --> 00:48.117
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Delko,

00:48.184 --> 00:49.417
but your checking account is overdrawn.

00:49.484 --> 00:50.618
That's impossible.

00:50.683 --> 00:52.518
I just deposited my last paycheck.

00:52.584 --> 00:53.950
Well, it's depleted.

00:54.017 --> 00:54.950
Mostly cash withdrawals.

00:55.017 --> 00:56.017
Okay, fine.

00:56.084 --> 00:58.518
Who do I need to see about a loan?

00:58.553 --> 00:59.484
Everybody down!

00:59.550 --> 01:00.317
Get down!

01:01.817 --> 01:02.850
Do it, get down!

01:04.051 --> 01:05.150
I said everyone down on the floor!

01:08.917 --> 01:10.817
Get down on the floor! Get down!

01:10.884 --> 01:12.518
Get down, yeah!

01:14.784 --> 01:16.284
Everybody down!

01:16.351 --> 01:17.251
Not you...

01:17.317 --> 01:18.717
up, up, up!

01:18.784 --> 01:19.950
Money in your bottom drawer, put it in that.

01:20.017 --> 01:20.850
You!

01:20.917 --> 01:21.850
You the manager?

01:21.917 --> 01:22.817
You're coming with us.

01:22.884 --> 01:25.051
Let's go! Let's go!

01:25.117 --> 01:26.418
Move it! Come on!

01:27.084 --> 01:27.917
Hurry up!

01:30.084 --> 01:32.384
All of it, all of it.

01:35.117 --> 01:36.484
Now come on.

01:37.617 --> 01:38.550
You're coming with us!

01:38.617 --> 01:39.884
Come on!

01:39.950 --> 01:41.683
All of it! All of it! Let's go, let's go.

01:43.850 --> 01:45.384
Ooh...

01:45.451 --> 01:46.384
Bonus round!

01:46.451 --> 01:47.418
Tap that stuff.

01:49.117 --> 01:50.518
Please...

01:50.583 --> 01:51.784
Chill.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.317
It'll be over before you know it.

01:55.984 --> 01:57.151
Miami-Dade PD!

02:00.850 --> 02:01.550
Cop!

02:01.617 --> 02:02.151
Take him out!

02:07.650 --> 02:10.317
You kill us, you kill him!

02:22.384 --> 02:24.418
Miss, you hold on, okay?

02:24.484 --> 02:26.550
You hold on.

02:26.617 --> 02:27.650
Hold on.

02:27.717 --> 02:29.217
This is Delko, CSI.

02:29.284 --> 02:32.884
Armed robbery just occurred at Dade Mutual Bank on Flagler.

02:32.950 --> 02:35.251
Suspects heavily armed and in flight.

02:35.317 --> 02:36.717
I need rescue immediately!

02:36.784 --> 02:39.984
I've got three gunshot victims, at least one critical.

02:40.051 --> 02:41.017
Hold on, Miss.

02:41.084 --> 02:42.650
Don't give up, fight it.

02:42.717 --> 02:43.650
Come on!

02:43.717 --> 02:44.650
Miss?

02:44.717 --> 02:47.217
Hold on, Miss.

02:47.284 --> 02:48.217
Stay with me.

02:48.284 --> 02:49.683
Come on!

02:49.750 --> 02:50.750
Miss!

03:02.518 --> 03:04.817
That's some piece of hardware, Alexx.

03:06.583 --> 03:08.184
Who do we have here?

03:12.950 --> 03:16.117
He's just a boy, Horatio.

03:16.184 --> 03:20.051
18, maybe 19 years old.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.717
No ID.

03:21.784 --> 03:24.317
But I did find this.

03:24.384 --> 03:25.351
Some kind of a clicker.

03:25.418 --> 03:26.850
Club bouncers use them

03:26.917 --> 03:29.817
to keep track of how many patrons they let in.

03:29.884 --> 03:32.917
I think we'll agree this is no bouncer.

03:32.984 --> 03:34.084
Nothing about this makes sense.

03:34.151 --> 03:35.583
The vault's untouched.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.384
There are eight teller stations filled with cash

03:37.451 --> 03:38.583
and they only rob one?

03:38.650 --> 03:39.850
Then attempted a rape

03:39.917 --> 03:41.317
in the middle of a hot crime?

03:41.384 --> 03:43.017
Nothing they've done was logical.

03:43.084 --> 03:44.717
Maybe not to us.

03:47.284 --> 03:48.817
What's going on, Horatio?

03:48.884 --> 03:50.850
Alexx...

03:50.917 --> 03:53.518
Miami has a new breed of criminal.

04:57.321 --> 04:58.554
Bronson, do me a favor

04:58.621 --> 05:01.187
and make sure Wolfe gets a picture of this.

05:01.254 --> 05:02.954
One of these guys was wearing Heelys.

05:04.154 --> 05:06.020
Get down right now!

05:21.187 --> 05:22.554
Your eye looks better,

05:22.621 --> 05:23.820
guess the antibiotic's working.

05:23.887 --> 05:25.254
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:26.321 --> 05:27.287
Ryan, can I have word?

05:27.354 --> 05:28.321
No.

05:28.387 --> 05:29.621
No, no, no. No comment.

05:29.688 --> 05:30.820
Zero, zip.

05:30.887 --> 05:32.187
Ryan, if you don't deal with this,

05:32.254 --> 05:33.688
it's going to bite you in...

05:33.753 --> 05:34.987
Look, my colleague almost got killed.

05:35.054 --> 05:36.654
So, until we catch these guys,

05:36.720 --> 05:38.588
I'm not going to say another word to you.

05:39.621 --> 05:40.554
It's your loss.

05:40.621 --> 05:41.987
I'll survive.

05:46.421 --> 05:47.554
The bank's security system indicates

05:47.621 --> 05:49.853
you were the first to activate your alarm.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.087
Yeah, I had a bad feeling

05:51.154 --> 05:52.987
as soon as I saw them at the door.

05:53.054 --> 05:54.287
Those masks?

05:54.354 --> 05:55.621
It's never Halloween at a bank.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.887
What'd you do after you activated the alarm?

05:57.954 --> 06:00.087
I gave him everything in my drawer.

06:00.154 --> 06:01.187
Eighteen thousand.

06:01.254 --> 06:02.887
Did you manage to insert a dye pack?

06:02.954 --> 06:04.154
Yeah.

06:04.221 --> 06:05.487
I thought they'd notice.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.054
You... up, up, up!

06:08.120 --> 06:09.387
Money in the bottom drawer.

06:09.454 --> 06:10.654
Put it in that bag.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.287
Move it! Come on!

06:25.221 --> 06:26.853
Now! Come on!

06:28.387 --> 06:30.487
But when they didn't shoot me,

06:30.554 --> 06:34.054
I realized they didn't know much about banks.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.087
Just enough to be dangerous.

06:35.154 --> 06:36.554
Thanks a lot. We'll be in touch.

06:36.621 --> 06:37.787
Sure.

06:41.287 --> 06:43.354
Robbers got 18,000 in toto.

06:43.421 --> 06:44.654
Good news is,

06:44.720 --> 06:46.254
the teller managed to insert a dye pack.

06:46.321 --> 06:47.954
Which is impossible to wash off.

06:48.020 --> 06:50.221
Is the bank manager still in the wind, Frank?

06:50.287 --> 06:51.387
Yeah, Greg Welch.

06:51.454 --> 06:53.154
Patrol checked his home, no sign of him.

06:53.221 --> 06:56.753
Okay. What about the thieves' vehicle, any description?

06:56.820 --> 06:58.954
They were all proned out, nobody saw a thing.

06:59.020 --> 07:00.354
Okay, not necessarily true. Thanks.

07:00.421 --> 07:01.820
Eric?

07:01.887 --> 07:03.954
So according to procedure, I'm on desk duty, right?

07:04.020 --> 07:06.621
No, actually, you're an eyewitness.

07:06.688 --> 07:08.054
How long after they entered

07:08.120 --> 07:09.387
did they start shooting the cameras?

07:09.454 --> 07:11.087
Immediately.

07:11.154 --> 07:11.987
Get down! Get down!

07:18.354 --> 07:20.154
Okay, where were you?

07:20.221 --> 07:24.287
I was talking to the bank manager.

07:24.354 --> 07:26.787
But before that, I was at the ATM.

07:26.853 --> 07:30.087
Eric, the ATM has a camera.

07:30.154 --> 07:32.654
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to get a hold of the video tapes,

07:32.720 --> 07:34.087
I'll get them over to A.V.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.022
Keep me posted.

07:35.023 --> 07:35.979
Will do.

07:39.820 --> 07:42.321
The bank had two cameras outside,

07:42.387 --> 07:44.421
one on the ATM machine itself, and another positioned

07:44.487 --> 07:46.688
to capture a view of the parking lot.

07:46.753 --> 07:49.054
They were set to take photos at six-second intervals.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.454
All right, can you split-screen it?

07:50.521 --> 07:51.521
Yeah.

07:54.020 --> 07:55.554
I can sync them up.

07:57.654 --> 07:58.787
At least your day started out well.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.688
Yeah, I almost forgot why I was there.

08:02.354 --> 08:04.154
You didn't get her number?

08:08.120 --> 08:11.753
Well, here's the robbers' vehicle.

08:11.820 --> 08:13.521
Wait. Wait. Go back a few frames.

08:16.820 --> 08:18.054
Look at that... they drive by

08:18.120 --> 08:20.521
and then they back up before they park.

08:20.588 --> 08:22.287
Okay, they spotted the Hummer.

08:22.354 --> 08:24.221
That means they knew there was a cop inside.

08:24.287 --> 08:25.987
Then why'd they go into the bank?

08:26.054 --> 08:26.987
I don't know.

08:27.054 --> 08:28.054
Keep going.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.486
I thought there were three.

08:34.554 --> 08:36.554
Well, the driver's obstructed by the tree.

08:36.621 --> 08:37.720
Jump ahead.

08:40.554 --> 08:41.554
Okay, there they are,

08:41.621 --> 08:42.554
they're leaving the bank

08:42.621 --> 08:43.688
they have the manager.

08:44.853 --> 08:46.321
What about the car?

08:46.387 --> 08:48.454
Plate's obstructed, it's not much.

08:49.853 --> 08:51.454
Wait, what's that on the windshield?

08:51.521 --> 08:53.154
Some kind of sticker.

09:00.720 --> 09:01.521
"Miami University. "

09:05.087 --> 09:07.688
Yeah, put me through to the campus police at Miami U.

09:09.454 --> 09:11.054
This is Ryan Wolfe, CSI.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.087
We think a couple of your students robbed a bank today.

09:13.154 --> 09:17.020
One of them parks in parking lot 23A.

09:17.087 --> 09:18.020
You did?

09:18.087 --> 09:20.354
Well, what's her name?

09:22.054 --> 09:22.987
Okay, thank you.

09:23.054 --> 09:24.287
What's up?

09:24.354 --> 09:26.753
A dye pack exploded on a female student

09:26.820 --> 09:27.954
at Miami University.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.753
Really?

09:29.820 --> 09:30.987
Yeah, campus police called P.D.

09:31.054 --> 09:32.387
They're bringing her here right now.

09:35.454 --> 09:36.920
Thank you.

09:36.987 --> 09:39.621
Campus police said that you came running out

09:39.688 --> 09:41.688
of the dorm laundry room screaming.

09:41.753 --> 09:44.354
When they checked inside, they found that.

09:44.421 --> 09:46.521
Eighteen-thousand dollars.

09:46.588 --> 09:48.454
Same amount missing from the bank teller.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.887
I don't know anything about this money.

09:50.954 --> 09:51.887
Really?

09:51.954 --> 09:53.120
You just stumble on it?

09:53.187 --> 09:54.588
Yeah. I was washing clothes

09:54.654 --> 09:55.621
in the dorm basement,

09:55.688 --> 09:57.054
I saw the bag,

09:57.120 --> 09:59.354
and I figured somebody left their laundry behind.

09:59.421 --> 10:02.487
I'm nosy, so I looked in and..

10:07.853 --> 10:10.588
Kim, that just doesn't make sense.

10:10.654 --> 10:11.987
The dye packs explode

10:12.054 --> 10:13.987
ten seconds after they pass the bank sensors.

10:14.054 --> 10:17.120
The university is five miles away from the bank.

10:17.187 --> 10:19.454
I don't know what to tell you.

10:19.521 --> 10:20.521
I'm not lying.

10:22.054 --> 10:23.654
You guilty about something.

10:26.421 --> 10:28.987
Well...

10:29.054 --> 10:31.853
I was never supposed to be in the Y dorm.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.987
I live in the Quad, which is a zoo.

10:34.054 --> 10:35.753
The machines there are always full...

10:35.820 --> 10:37.154
if they're even working at all.

10:37.221 --> 10:41.421
The Y dorms are, like, way new and empty.

10:43.154 --> 10:44.521
Does this stuff come off?

10:44.588 --> 10:46.753
It's methylamino-anthraquinone.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.421
It's built for longevity, it may take awhile.

10:48.487 --> 10:50.254
Great.

10:50.321 --> 10:51.654
Am I allowed to leave now?

10:52.688 --> 10:54.254
That depends.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.887
On what?

10:55.954 --> 10:57.287
On if your story checks out.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.588
You going to call in that Treasury guy?

11:03.654 --> 11:05.254
Special Agent Elliott? Yeah.

11:05.321 --> 11:06.920
Does any of that sound hinky to you?

11:06.987 --> 11:09.287
No more than the rest of this case.

11:09.354 --> 11:11.654
Why would guys rob a bank and toss out the money?

11:11.720 --> 11:13.120
Maybe they don't want it.

11:13.187 --> 11:14.521
Well, who doesn't want money?

11:14.588 --> 11:16.354
I didn't say that it made sense.

11:16.421 --> 11:17.354
All right.

11:17.421 --> 11:18.588
I'll look at ROs

11:18.654 --> 11:20.020
for the vehicles in parking lot 23A,

11:20.087 --> 11:21.454
see if I can find the driver.

11:21.521 --> 11:22.954
All right, I'm going to get that to Trace.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.154
Money bag?

11:24.221 --> 11:25.720
Yeah. I'll see you later. All right.

11:31.820 --> 11:34.321
Mr. Wolfe... is that the money bag?

11:34.387 --> 11:35.688
Dye pack pretty much obliterated

11:35.753 --> 11:38.120
any chance of finding anything inside.

11:38.187 --> 11:39.853
That leaves the outside, doesn't it?

11:43.621 --> 11:45.753
Water mark?

11:45.820 --> 11:49.987
Might get us something.

11:50.054 --> 11:52.221
There's one way to find out.

11:52.287 --> 11:53.688
It'll take some time.

11:53.753 --> 11:55.521
Okay, not a problem. I'll be on the cell.

11:55.588 --> 11:59.187
Mr. Wolfe, I got a call from Erica Sikes.

11:59.254 --> 12:01.287
Damn it.

12:01.354 --> 12:04.120
I'm really sorry she bothered you.

12:04.187 --> 12:07.221
I... I told her I wouldn't give her a quote.

12:07.287 --> 12:09.654
It wasn't about a quote.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.954
What's going on?

12:15.254 --> 12:17.987
I don't want you to worry about it, okay?

12:18.054 --> 12:19.820
I'll take care of it.

12:49.154 --> 12:52.621
40% ethylene glycol solution.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.588
Yeah, that's a coolant mixed into water.

12:54.654 --> 12:57.020
It keeps water circulating in subfreezing temperatures.

12:57.087 --> 12:59.120
I can think of one place at a university

12:59.187 --> 13:00.521
that has that. Yeah.

13:20.354 --> 13:21.588
This is it.

13:21.654 --> 13:23.221
We don't need to see the ice.

13:23.287 --> 13:24.853
We need to see where they make it.

13:24.920 --> 13:25.987
So this is secure

13:26.054 --> 13:27.454
all the time, huh?

13:27.521 --> 13:28.920
Hey, I locked this myself last night.

13:28.987 --> 13:31.720
Okay.

13:37.321 --> 13:39.354
Hey... that's the bank manager.

13:39.421 --> 13:42.820
Hey...

13:42.887 --> 13:44.487
Get me out of here, please.

13:44.554 --> 13:46.487
All right, all right, hang tight.

13:47.521 --> 13:50.221
Mr. Welch, do you remember me?

13:50.287 --> 13:52.287
Eric Delko. I was at the bank today.

13:52.354 --> 13:55.221
Did you get a look at the guys who put you in here?

13:55.287 --> 13:56.654
They never took their masks off.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.020
Did they say anything,

13:58.087 --> 13:59.954
anything at all that might help us?

14:00.020 --> 14:02.354
They said they'd kill me if I didn't tell them.

14:02.421 --> 14:03.688
Tell them what?

14:03.753 --> 14:05.454
About the money drop this afternoon.

14:05.521 --> 14:06.753
What money drop?

14:06.820 --> 14:09.887
The Federal Reserve brings in fresh currency

14:09.954 --> 14:12.387
for the retail banks in metro Miami,

14:12.454 --> 14:15.020
once a week, at a specific time.

14:15.087 --> 14:18.087
So the $18,000 was just a cover to take you hostage, and...

14:18.154 --> 14:19.654
go after a bigger payday?

14:19.720 --> 14:21.688
Yeah, a huge payday. Where's the drop?

14:21.753 --> 14:23.554
It's at the main branch on West Seventh.

14:23.621 --> 14:25.221
1:30, by helicopter.

14:25.287 --> 14:26.820
That's in 20 minutes.

14:26.887 --> 14:28.688
H., listen, I've got the hostage,

14:28.787 --> 14:30.521
and the location of their next hit.

14:30.588 --> 14:32.120
Nice and slow.

14:32.187 --> 14:33.787
That's it, keep coming.

14:33.853 --> 14:36.221
Okay, stop!

14:36.287 --> 14:37.787
Yeah, right there, right there's good.

14:37.853 --> 14:39.720
Yeah, that's good.

14:39.787 --> 14:42.087
Okay, now, drop the money.

14:44.820 --> 14:46.588
And drop your guns.

14:46.654 --> 14:48.221
I suggest you do the same thing,

14:48.287 --> 14:49.887
my friend.

14:49.954 --> 14:52.920
Put the weapon down, and get on the ground right now.

14:54.221 --> 14:56.753
Put your hands behind your head!

15:01.154 --> 15:08.621
Eric, get that mask off him.

15:09.853 --> 15:11.521
Better watch your grill, Johnny Law.

15:11.588 --> 15:13.454
We're still in play.

15:13.521 --> 15:14.621
Is that right?

15:14.688 --> 15:16.354
What did you say?

15:16.421 --> 15:17.954
Ah, you heard me.

15:18.020 --> 15:20.720
Put him in the car.

15:22.920 --> 15:26.321
Ryan... what did that mean?

15:28.354 --> 15:30.454
H., I got something I got to show you.

15:30.521 --> 15:32.954
Let's do that.

15:36.321 --> 15:38.920
I kept thinking the bank was like an old case.

15:38.987 --> 15:40.454
The thing is, I couldn't remember which old case.

15:40.521 --> 15:42.954
Then that kid said what he said up there.

15:43.020 --> 15:46.987
He said, "We're still in play. "

15:52.688 --> 15:54.054
Hit the floor!

16:10.120 --> 16:12.254
Level two.

16:12.321 --> 16:14.287
Everything, just like it happened in the bank.

16:14.354 --> 16:16.187
Ready? And then this.

16:20.987 --> 16:22.987
Still in play.

16:23.054 --> 16:26.254
Mr. Wolfe...

16:26.321 --> 16:28.621
They seem to be recreating a game.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.254
A video game.

16:30.321 --> 16:32.688
Which explains why they robbed the bank and tossed the money.

16:32.753 --> 16:34.654
That's why they kill people without provocation.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.588
None of this is real to them.

16:36.654 --> 16:39.521
It will all be very real soon, Mr. Wolfe.

16:39.588 --> 16:41.321
Quite real.

16:57.624 --> 16:59.023
You got here fast.

16:59.090 --> 17:00.858
Always do when it's a Calleigh Duquesne 9-1-1.

17:01.923 --> 17:03.080
So, dye packs?

17:03.081 --> 17:03.656
College student,

17:03.657 --> 17:06.523
Kim Mills, she stumbled onto a money bag on campus,

17:06.590 --> 17:08.156
said the dye pack exploded on her.

17:08.223 --> 17:10.523
Is there any way the dye pack malfunctioned back at the bank?

17:10.590 --> 17:11.824
Can happen if the thieves somehow

17:11.890 --> 17:13.057
bypassed the bank's sensors, yeah.

17:13.124 --> 17:14.998
Have you ever seen it happen?

17:14.999 --> 17:15.490
Sure.

17:15.491 --> 17:17.691
Especially when they take a scared employee with them as hostage,

17:17.758 --> 17:19.124
someone to show them the ropes.

17:19.190 --> 17:20.590
Yeah, the suspects got the bank manager,

17:20.656 --> 17:22.656
and he checks out all the way down the line.

17:22.723 --> 17:24.290
I think your girl's authentic, but...

17:24.357 --> 17:26.022
I'll interview her just to cover our bases.

17:26.089 --> 17:27.156
Oh, that'd be great, thanks.

17:27.223 --> 17:28.557
And as long as I'm here,

17:28.624 --> 17:30.391
any chance I can look at the recovered money?

17:30.457 --> 17:32.290
Sure. It's over in Q.D.

17:32.357 --> 17:33.267
Have at it.

17:33.268 --> 17:34.056
Calleigh?

17:34.057 --> 17:36.157
It's good to see you again.

17:36.224 --> 17:38.758
It's great to see you, too.

17:41.957 --> 17:44.224
Miss Mills, I'm Special Agent Peter Elliott

17:44.290 --> 17:45.524
with the Treasury Department.

17:45.591 --> 17:47.524
I going to have to ask you some questions.

17:47.591 --> 17:48.657
Okay.

17:48.724 --> 17:50.224
Empty your pockets.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.491
We found one of those

17:59.557 --> 18:01.724
on your dead partner, Junior.

18:01.791 --> 18:03.324
He's not my partner.

18:03.391 --> 18:05.391
Besides, you guys will never guess

18:05.457 --> 18:07.190
what the clicker's for.

18:07.257 --> 18:08.824
You use them to add up points,

18:08.890 --> 18:11.190
because you're playing a game, aren't you?

18:11.257 --> 18:13.591
You played that game so much, it got boring.

18:24.290 --> 18:27.057
So you felt you had to go out and do it for real.

18:27.124 --> 18:29.491
You're crazy.

18:31.758 --> 18:33.524
That's why you chose Dade Mutual.

18:33.591 --> 18:35.391
That photograph

18:35.457 --> 18:36.824
puts you there.

18:36.890 --> 18:38.591
Your Heelys.

18:38.657 --> 18:41.691
You saw the Hummer parked outside, just like in the game.

18:41.758 --> 18:43.724
You followed the cop inside.

18:53.324 --> 18:55.157
Because a bank with a police officer

18:55.224 --> 18:56.391
is worth more points.

18:56.457 --> 18:58.290
Isn't it?

19:08.190 --> 19:10.457
Thousand bonus.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.057
Five, if you waste him.

19:13.124 --> 19:14.791
And what if one of your running buddies

19:14.858 --> 19:15.957
gets shot in the process?

19:16.023 --> 19:17.758
Scream?

19:17.824 --> 19:20.224
Everybody buys it sometime.

19:20.290 --> 19:21.923
That's part of the game.

19:21.990 --> 19:24.890
We're looking for your friend with the demon mask?

19:26.758 --> 19:30.057
If I dime him out, that's minus, what, 500 points.

19:30.124 --> 19:33.424
If you don't, it's 25 to life.

19:33.491 --> 19:35.090
I'm already ahead on points.

19:35.157 --> 19:38.023
Besides, good behavior...

19:38.090 --> 19:42.591
I'll be out in... ten.

19:42.657 --> 19:45.791
30's the new 20, chief.

19:45.858 --> 19:47.224
Inventive.

19:47.290 --> 19:48.491
Take him.

19:48.557 --> 19:51.324
Come on.

19:54.224 --> 19:57.758
So... what's the next step?

19:57.824 --> 20:00.758
Well, we figure out Demon's next step, Frank.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.023
If he's still playing, he'll hit

20:02.090 --> 20:03.357
whatever's next on the game, won't he?

20:03.424 --> 20:06.190
Let's talk to the man who wrote the game.

20:06.257 --> 20:08.624
You are the president of Trans International?

20:08.691 --> 20:10.824
Urban Hellraiser is our top seller.

20:10.890 --> 20:13.624
800,000 units sold last quarter alone.

20:13.691 --> 20:15.157
I'm gonna need a breakdown on your game.

20:15.224 --> 20:16.224
Where the player goes,

20:16.290 --> 20:18.957
what he has to do, when and how.

20:19.023 --> 20:20.691
Sorry, but that's proprietary.

20:20.758 --> 20:22.257
You wouldn't ask Colonel Sanders

20:22.324 --> 20:24.157
about his 11 herbs and spices, right?

20:24.224 --> 20:26.858
But here's the difference: there's a crime spree in Miami

20:26.923 --> 20:28.290
based on your game.

20:28.357 --> 20:29.791
Our in-house counsel informs me

20:29.858 --> 20:32.157
that any similarities between this morning's events

20:32.224 --> 20:34.624
and our game are purely coincidental.

20:34.691 --> 20:37.824
I want you to tell that to the family of the dead bank teller.

20:40.424 --> 20:41.890
Look...

20:41.957 --> 20:44.591
I have a board to answer to... stockholders.

20:44.657 --> 20:46.090
My hands are tied.

20:46.157 --> 20:48.257
Well, maybe a night in lockup will help untie them.

20:48.324 --> 20:50.758
Guys, I'd love to help, really.

20:50.824 --> 20:53.124
But if you want to know what's in the game, well...

20:53.190 --> 20:55.424
I suggest you play it.

20:55.491 --> 20:57.357
But in the meantime, Detective Tripp here

20:57.424 --> 20:59.557
is going to arrest you for obstruction of justice.

21:02.491 --> 21:06.591
Mr. Wolfe, I want you to do me a favor.

21:06.657 --> 21:08.090
Play the game.

21:22.724 --> 21:23.858
You seen Peter Elliott?

21:23.923 --> 21:25.457
Is that that federal guy,

21:25.524 --> 21:26.923
with the salt and pepper hair? Yeah.

21:26.990 --> 21:28.758
Yeah, he poked his head in, and he wanted

21:28.824 --> 21:30.090
the Questioned Documents lab.

21:30.157 --> 21:31.624
You sent him to Fingerprints, right?

21:31.691 --> 21:32.624
Yeah, of course.

21:33.890 --> 21:35.391
He's just here to see Calleigh, anyway.

21:35.457 --> 21:36.824
Yeah, he's had a thing for Calleigh

21:36.890 --> 21:38.691
since the first money case they worked together.

21:38.758 --> 21:39.858
You get anything yet?

21:39.923 --> 21:41.923
I can't get past the second level...

21:41.990 --> 21:43.457
'cause you keep shooting me!

21:43.524 --> 21:44.758
What?

21:44.824 --> 21:47.524
It's not you, it's the cop in this game.

21:47.591 --> 21:49.324
You're dead.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.324
Try again.

21:56.357 --> 21:59.090
That's weird.

21:59.157 --> 22:02.824
It's just like this morning, in the bank.

22:02.890 --> 22:06.624
I wish I could have saved that teller.

22:06.691 --> 22:08.357
At least you were there for the girl.

22:08.424 --> 22:10.057
In the game, she's worth a thousand points.

22:10.124 --> 22:12.591
For raping her?

22:12.657 --> 22:13.957
Yeah.

22:14.023 --> 22:16.190
Now you know why I stopped playing this game at home.

22:17.357 --> 22:19.591
Anyways, game pretty much follows

22:19.657 --> 22:20.824
everything that's happened so far.

22:20.890 --> 22:22.224
You rob the bank,

22:22.290 --> 22:23.624
you grab the bank manager, you kill the teller.

22:23.691 --> 22:24.824
Level two.

22:24.890 --> 22:26.758
Manager tells them where the money drop is.

22:26.824 --> 22:29.124
But getting busted by CSI wasn't part of the plan.

22:29.190 --> 22:30.691
Yeah, or the game.

22:32.791 --> 22:34.758
What the hell is that?

22:34.824 --> 22:35.890
It says, "Sniper mode. "

22:37.157 --> 22:39.758
Sniper? I didn't see a sniper there today.

22:39.824 --> 22:42.791
Doesn't mean there wasn't one on a nearby building, watching.

22:42.858 --> 22:44.591
Well, then why didn't he take a shot?

22:44.657 --> 22:46.023
Only one way to find out.

22:46.090 --> 22:47.124
Let's go. Hold on, not you.

22:47.190 --> 22:48.391
You stay and play the game.

22:48.457 --> 22:49.858
You're the only one that knows how.

22:49.923 --> 22:51.457
Yeah, but then I lose the collar.

22:51.524 --> 22:53.190
I guess so.

22:53.257 --> 22:55.524
Keep playing, game boy.

23:13.424 --> 23:15.923
Got a jacketed casing.

23:15.990 --> 23:17.023
It's a 3-0-8.

23:17.090 --> 23:19.124
That's a sniper's round, Eric.

23:19.190 --> 23:22.791
Well, if there was a sniper here, why didn't he fire on us?

23:22.858 --> 23:24.724
That's how it works in the game.

23:24.791 --> 23:27.591
Area looks pretty clear to me.

23:27.657 --> 23:30.324
Yes, but it wasn't a couple of hours ago, was it?

23:30.391 --> 23:33.324
A couple of hours ago, the Fed helicopter was here.

23:33.391 --> 23:35.457
The position was different than it is in the game.

23:35.524 --> 23:37.591
It must have blocked any shot he might have had.

23:37.657 --> 23:43.023
What did he do after we arrested his...

23:43.090 --> 23:44.023
his partner?

23:44.090 --> 23:46.657
Eric, do you see that?

23:46.724 --> 23:47.923
Yeah.

23:47.990 --> 23:50.824
Looks like the mask Demon wore in the robbery.

24:00.624 --> 24:02.923
You think leaving this mask behind was part of the game?

24:02.990 --> 24:05.557
I don't know, but if we can get his DNA off it,

24:05.624 --> 24:08.391
we can beat him at his own game.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.624
Did Valera swab it for DNA?

24:19.691 --> 24:23.724
Yeah, she said the guy salivated all over it, just breathing.

24:23.791 --> 24:25.224
So she's analyzing it now.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.324
Maybe the mask will give us something while we wait.

24:27.391 --> 24:29.758
That's right, biometrics.

24:29.824 --> 24:31.023
So these things are custom fitted?

24:31.090 --> 24:32.724
Yeah, most jocks insist on it.

24:32.791 --> 24:35.324
They usually mold the mask straight off the athlete's face.

25:13.157 --> 25:15.858
Our suspect must have customized it.

25:23.524 --> 25:25.157
So we could know what Demon looks like.

25:25.224 --> 25:26.624
Some work to do first.

25:26.691 --> 25:30.990
There are 80 nodal points on the human face.

25:31.057 --> 25:32.791
And we need about 17

25:32.858 --> 25:36.324
for the facial recognition program to make a comparison.

25:36.391 --> 25:37.624
You got to love it.

25:37.691 --> 25:39.491
The guy wears the mask for protection

25:39.557 --> 25:40.691
and it ends up nailing him.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.724
What are you using for a database?

25:44.791 --> 25:46.557
The Miami U. Student Facebook.

25:46.624 --> 25:47.890
Why not start with the athletes?

25:47.957 --> 25:49.491
Already spoke to the athletic director.

25:49.557 --> 25:52.457
He said that no current athlete wears one of these masks.

25:52.524 --> 25:53.957
How many students are in there?

25:55.057 --> 25:56.990
About 17,000 guys.

25:57.057 --> 25:58.357
Oh, my God.

25:58.424 --> 25:59.890
You're gonna be in for some overtime.

25:59.957 --> 26:01.290
All right, let me know.

26:01.357 --> 26:04.190
Will do.

26:12.791 --> 26:15.257
<i>Level two.</i>

26:25.758 --> 26:27.758
Want to get the door for me?

26:33.257 --> 26:34.190
<i>Congratulations.</i>

26:34.257 --> 26:36.824
<i>You are entering a new level.</i>

26:36.890 --> 26:39.391
<i>Level three.</i>

26:57.357 --> 26:58.290
How's our coed?

26:58.357 --> 26:59.290
She checked out.

26:59.357 --> 27:00.591
Homicide released her.

27:00.657 --> 27:02.190
Did you visit the stolen money? Eventually.

27:02.257 --> 27:04.923
One of your video guys sent me on a wild goose chase.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.190
Rank on the federal agent.

27:07.257 --> 27:08.190
I am so sorry.

27:08.257 --> 27:09.491
I apologize on their behalf.

27:09.557 --> 27:10.923
Not necessary.

27:10.990 --> 27:14.090
But I could play it up, ask you to grab a drink with me

27:14.157 --> 27:15.257
when you get off tonight.

27:15.324 --> 27:18.691
Um... well, I tell you what.

27:18.758 --> 27:21.090
We catch these gamers, I'll make it a whole dinner.

27:21.157 --> 27:22.724
- Horatio.
- Yeah.

27:22.791 --> 27:24.257
I just got to the next level.

27:24.324 --> 27:26.057
Talk to me.

27:26.124 --> 27:27.624
It's a police station.

27:27.691 --> 27:29.290
Player has to go in and steal the evidence against him.

27:29.357 --> 27:31.691
In real life, we store the evidence here at CSI.

27:31.758 --> 27:33.990
Mr. Wolfe, go down and alert security right now.

27:45.990 --> 27:46.923
Give me the mask!

27:47.824 --> 27:49.257
Give me the mask!

27:49.324 --> 27:51.624
Do it or I'll blow your head off!

27:52.324 --> 27:53.190
Do it, now!

28:04.090 --> 28:06.624
5,000 points,

28:06.691 --> 28:08.657
bitch!

28:08.724 --> 28:10.691
Add 'em up!

28:21.057 --> 28:21.791
Don't do it!

28:28.357 --> 28:29.524
Hey!

28:41.457 --> 28:45.023
Peter.

28:56.057 --> 28:59.957
It's your call.

29:15.740 --> 29:16.874
Tech-Nine.

29:16.941 --> 29:18.674
Same type of gun used at the bank.

29:18.740 --> 29:20.841
Expensive arsenal for a college budget.

29:20.907 --> 29:22.874
It sure is. Tripp traced the serial numbers

29:22.941 --> 29:25.308
from the bank Tech-Nine to a stolen shipment out of Tampa,

29:25.407 --> 29:27.141
and I bet we'll find this gun matches.

29:27.208 --> 29:28.440
Okay, what's your name, son?

29:28.507 --> 29:29.974
Glasses.

29:30.041 --> 29:31.674
Not your game name, what's your real name?

29:33.640 --> 29:35.740
Michael Page.

29:35.807 --> 29:37.007
Okay, get him up, please.

29:39.674 --> 29:40.941
That hurts!

29:41.007 --> 29:42.473
Real bullets are funny like that, Michael.

29:42.540 --> 29:44.473
Get him a paramedic,

29:44.540 --> 29:46.174
but put him in the box.

29:47.373 --> 29:49.707
How's Agent Elliott?

29:49.774 --> 29:52.874
Calleigh is at the E.R. with him right now.

29:52.941 --> 29:54.407
This gang is bigger than we thought.

29:54.473 --> 29:56.340
Or the game is bigger.

29:56.407 --> 29:57.874
We're at a dead end now.

29:57.941 --> 30:01.640
Not necessarily, Eric.

30:01.707 --> 30:06.540
'Cause Glasses left his glasses.

30:12.308 --> 30:13.340
Hey.

30:13.407 --> 30:16.340
Hey, how you doing?

30:16.407 --> 30:17.874
I- I really...

30:17.941 --> 30:19.907
I want to apologize for leaving the evidence locker open.

30:19.974 --> 30:20.974
It's okay.

30:21.041 --> 30:22.874
Look, nothing got taken.

30:22.941 --> 30:23.874
You're okay.

30:23.941 --> 30:25.174
That's what's important.

30:29.208 --> 30:31.274
Guy who was just holding a gun to my head

30:31.340 --> 30:33.041
was wearing those.

30:33.107 --> 30:35.241
Check this out.

30:40.074 --> 30:41.507
What is that?

30:41.574 --> 30:43.007
That's what your guy was looking at

30:43.074 --> 30:44.208
before the bullets started flying.

30:44.274 --> 30:46.340
Like virtual reality. Sort of.

30:46.407 --> 30:48.707
Yeah, there's a camera built on to the frame of these things.

30:48.774 --> 30:52.007
And the camera projects an image onto the left lens.

30:52.074 --> 30:54.274
Lens is optic-embedded.

30:54.340 --> 30:56.274
Looks like a blueprint, but in 3-D.

30:56.340 --> 30:57.540
It's sort of familiar.

30:57.607 --> 30:59.640
Matter of fact, that's the remodeled lab.

30:59.707 --> 31:02.507
Yeah, that's DNA, right there.

31:02.574 --> 31:03.874
I specified a few changes

31:03.941 --> 31:05.707
after the floor plans were drawn up, but...

31:14.074 --> 31:16.340
And the plans for the lab have to be secure.

31:16.407 --> 31:17.574
Yeah.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.740
I worked with an architectural firm.

31:19.807 --> 31:21.141
What was the name of the firm?

31:21.208 --> 31:22.407
KNB Design.

31:22.473 --> 31:23.874
Miami.

31:23.941 --> 31:25.407
Downtown. Big loft space.

31:25.473 --> 31:27.074
That's good.

31:27.141 --> 31:29.241
I'm gonna call and get a list of their employees.

31:29.308 --> 31:32.007
Thanks.

31:37.473 --> 31:40.740
You look like you're in pain, Michael.

31:40.807 --> 31:44.007
I want Demon's real name.

31:44.074 --> 31:46.640
I don't know how it got this far.

31:46.707 --> 31:48.141
Yes, you do, Michael. Yes, you do.

31:48.208 --> 31:49.674
You had an internship

31:49.740 --> 31:52.540
at an architectural firm, you got the blueprints for CSI,

31:52.607 --> 31:55.340
you broke in and shot a lot of innocent people.

31:55.407 --> 31:56.340
So what's his name?

31:56.407 --> 31:58.941
I don't know.

31:59.007 --> 32:00.540
Michael,

32:00.607 --> 32:02.941
the faster you tell me, the faster you go to the hospital.

32:03.007 --> 32:04.041
It's up to you.

32:06.041 --> 32:08.440
I met Demon online.

32:08.507 --> 32:10.640
That's how I met all the other players.

32:10.707 --> 32:12.974
I only know him by his screen name.

32:13.041 --> 32:14.340
Where is he?

32:14.407 --> 32:15.574
Where would he hang out?

32:15.640 --> 32:17.074
The only place we have in common

32:17.141 --> 32:19.607
is the research library at Miami U.

32:19.674 --> 32:20.707
Basement.

32:20.774 --> 32:22.107
Why the library?

32:22.174 --> 32:23.241
We bring our stuff

32:23.308 --> 32:25.540
so the points can be validated.

32:25.607 --> 32:27.640
Guy named Wizard keeps track.

32:27.707 --> 32:28.774
Maybe he can tell you

32:28.841 --> 32:29.807
where Demon is.

32:29.874 --> 32:30.698
The scorekeeper.

32:30.699 --> 32:31.372
Evan Walsh.

32:31.373 --> 32:33.208
He's always there.

32:33.274 --> 32:35.707
Okay, take him to the hospital.

32:38.607 --> 32:41.308
Eric, Miami University, meet me there.

32:47.074 --> 32:49.340
<i>Your dead. Your dead.</i>

32:49.407 --> 32:51.340
<i>Your dead. Your dead.</i>

32:51.407 --> 32:55.340
<i>Your dead. Your dead. Your dead. Your dead.</i>

32:55.407 --> 32:56.841
<i>Your dead...</i>

32:56.907 --> 32:59.074
He's gone.

32:59.141 --> 33:02.807
<i>Your dead. Your dead. Your dead. Your dead.</i>

33:02.874 --> 33:05.473
Eric, turn that off, please.

33:05.540 --> 33:07.141
Yeah.

33:10.407 --> 33:11.907
Well, this kid was at the center of the game.

33:11.974 --> 33:14.141
He knew ever player and every crime.

33:14.208 --> 33:16.473
Yup, and he lost his life for it.

33:16.540 --> 33:19.640
I'll call the M.E.

33:24.308 --> 33:25.473
Alexx?

33:25.540 --> 33:26.807
One day.

33:26.874 --> 33:28.874
Three bodies under the age of 21.

33:28.941 --> 33:30.674
I don't like it, Horatio.

33:30.740 --> 33:32.440
Neither will their parents, Alexx. Cause of death?

33:32.507 --> 33:35.174
From the crystals on his skin, I'd say

33:35.241 --> 33:36.340
he went into renal failure.

33:36.407 --> 33:37.674
Computer log says

33:37.740 --> 33:40.540
that he's been playing non-stop for 70 hours.

33:50.340 --> 33:52.407
<i>Level two.</i>

33:53.407 --> 33:54.974
A look around this place

33:55.041 --> 33:56.574
confirms that, Eric.

33:56.640 --> 34:00.007
Yeah. Looks like he urinated in these bottles, too.

34:00.074 --> 34:01.574
Drank diuretics

34:01.640 --> 34:03.974
for three days, didn't sleep, didn't eat.

34:04.041 --> 34:05.540
The poor baby's heart gave out.

34:05.607 --> 34:08.940
So, he played... to death, Alexx.

34:09.007 --> 34:11.007
Thank you.

34:15.274 --> 34:18.174
Here's his scoreboard.

34:18.241 --> 34:20.241
Says Demon has over 20,000 points.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.574
Life and death reduced to points on a board,

34:23.639 --> 34:25.141
Eric.

34:25.208 --> 34:27.373
Well, we've got items brought here for validation,

34:27.440 --> 34:28.739
just like the kid said.

34:28.806 --> 34:29.841
And we have some more Tech-Nines

34:29.907 --> 34:31.174
right there.

34:31.241 --> 34:32.841
Yeah. Well, this Wizard

34:32.907 --> 34:34.074
kept a record of everything.

34:34.141 --> 34:37.373
"1312 Surf Street. "

34:37.440 --> 34:38.841
Surf Street?

34:38.907 --> 34:40.974
I know where that is. Come on, Eric.

34:51.574 --> 34:53.940
All right, we'll see you tomorrow, sweetheart.

34:54.974 --> 34:57.007
Police! Everybody down!

34:57.074 --> 34:59.407
Hold it right there. Don't move.

34:59.473 --> 35:01.440
Eric, who do we have here?

35:01.507 --> 35:03.241
His name's Carl Hiatt.

35:03.308 --> 35:04.540
Hey, what is this?

35:04.607 --> 35:06.208
I have clients coming any minute.

35:06.274 --> 35:08.874
Mr. Hiatt, you're gonna have to reschedule those clients.

35:08.941 --> 35:10.874
Got more Tech-Nines there, too.

35:10.941 --> 35:12.740
No doubt, part of the stolen shipment

35:12.807 --> 35:14.574
Detective Tripp is looking for.

35:14.640 --> 35:17.440
I don't know anything about that.

35:17.507 --> 35:20.640
Look, the guy delivers me the guns, pays me

35:20.707 --> 35:22.607
some cash to give them to these kids.

35:22.674 --> 35:24.141
They knock on the door, give me a password,

35:24.208 --> 35:26.274
I give them up. That's it.

35:26.340 --> 35:27.473
Who's the guy?

35:27.540 --> 35:28.707
No idea.

35:28.774 --> 35:29.941
I never see him.

35:30.007 --> 35:31.373
Everything's online.

35:31.440 --> 35:33.440
You're gonna have to do better than that, Carl.

35:38.674 --> 35:40.141
Maybe not, Eric.

35:42.574 --> 35:44.473
Well...

35:44.540 --> 35:47.241
Trance International.

35:47.308 --> 35:49.373
That's familiar.

35:58.473 --> 36:01.507
<i>Dr. Forrest, dial 118, please.</i>

36:01.574 --> 36:03.074
<i>Dr. Forrest, please dial...</i>

36:03.141 --> 36:04.640
You're sure you should be released?

36:04.707 --> 36:06.540
It's a couple stitches. It's no big deal.

36:06.607 --> 36:07.974
I- I just need my release papers.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.208
You don't hurt anywhere else?

36:09.274 --> 36:11.141
I'm okay, Calleigh Nightingale.

36:12.174 --> 36:14.473
Oh, excuse me.

36:16.041 --> 36:17.440
I got a medical, GSW.

36:17.507 --> 36:19.274
Uniforms are with him in the waiting room.

36:19.340 --> 36:20.540
Take your time with him.

36:20.607 --> 36:21.974
Hey, Frank.

36:22.041 --> 36:23.373
I've got the little twerp shooter

36:23.440 --> 36:25.174
from CSI. How's your guy?

36:25.241 --> 36:26.574
Tough as nails.

36:26.640 --> 36:27.774
I better get back.

36:27.841 --> 36:29.373
My guy's probably up.

36:29.440 --> 36:30.841
All right. I'll see you back there.

36:30.907 --> 36:32.208
All right.

36:33.507 --> 36:35.039
Agent Peter Elliott... I was told

36:35.040 --> 36:36.478
he was transported here. Can you help me?

36:36.479 --> 36:37.940
Are you from the Treasury Department?

36:37.941 --> 36:40.984
I'm his fiancèe.

36:40.985 --> 36:44.472
Oh. Okay.

36:44.473 --> 36:47.340
Uh, I was told that he was rushed here?

36:47.407 --> 36:48.874
Uh, yeah. I-I brought him.

36:48.941 --> 36:50.141
You're the one.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.141
Thank you so much. I don't know what

36:52.208 --> 36:53.674
he would have done without you.

36:53.740 --> 36:55.174
Is he okay?

36:55.241 --> 36:56.841
Yeah, he's fine. He's right over there.

36:56.907 --> 36:57.841
Oh.

36:57.907 --> 36:59.740
Thank you.

37:33.308 --> 37:35.674
Trance International, Chris.

37:35.740 --> 37:37.674
I understand that's your holding company.

37:37.740 --> 37:39.674
That's a matter of public record, Lieutenant.

37:39.740 --> 37:41.107
Your company owns

37:41.174 --> 37:43.174
quite a bit of real estate, particularly a building

37:43.241 --> 37:45.041
at 1312 Surf Street.

37:45.107 --> 37:47.373
I own many investment properties.

37:47.440 --> 37:49.407
Yes, but this building, Chris,

37:49.473 --> 37:53.473
is used for the trafficking of weapons to juveniles.

37:53.540 --> 37:56.107
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:56.174 --> 37:57.874
No. That doesn't matter, because

37:57.941 --> 38:00.141
your friend over there is doing quite a bit

38:00.208 --> 38:02.507
of talking, Chris.

38:07.107 --> 38:08.507
You used these kids

38:08.574 --> 38:10.841
to sell that video game, didn't you?

38:13.807 --> 38:15.740
The gaming business is competitive.

38:15.807 --> 38:17.740
I needed an edge.

38:17.807 --> 38:19.974
Real weapons, real locations,

38:20.041 --> 38:22.941
and real lives were lost, Chris.

38:24.974 --> 38:27.107
I'm not saying anything else till I see my lawyer.

38:27.174 --> 38:29.041
You don't have to. I'm gonna talk.

38:29.107 --> 38:30.507
You're under arrest

38:30.574 --> 38:32.740
for conspiracy to commit murder

38:32.807 --> 38:35.807
and the trafficking of illegal firearms.

38:35.874 --> 38:36.844
I'll never serve one day in prison.

38:36.845 --> 38:37.840
No, you're right.

38:37.841 --> 38:40.440
You are right, sir,

38:40.507 --> 38:44.107
because you are gonna serve thousands of them.

38:44.174 --> 38:45.807
Take him away, please.

38:45.874 --> 38:47.373
See you, Chris.

39:03.841 --> 39:06.274
Good thing the gunman didn't get away with my swabs.

39:06.340 --> 39:08.308
Yeah, they didn't even break the seal.

39:08.373 --> 39:09.807
I'll process them.

39:09.874 --> 39:11.141
Can you put a rush on it this time?

39:11.208 --> 39:12.707
Cute, Eric.

39:12.774 --> 39:14.141
That the face print program?

39:14.208 --> 39:16.640
Yeah, I've been running characteristics

39:16.707 --> 39:18.774
of Miami University students for hours.

39:18.841 --> 39:20.874
H got the guy who was selling the guns,

39:20.941 --> 39:22.974
but we still don't know who Demon is.

39:26.440 --> 39:28.241
Looks like you got a winner.

39:28.308 --> 39:31.174
Yeah. John Berg. Sophomore.

39:31.241 --> 39:32.340
He used to play ball.

39:32.407 --> 39:33.574
I'll run the DNA,

39:33.640 --> 39:35.340
but it feels anticlimactic now.

39:35.407 --> 39:37.574
Cross the Ts, Valera.

39:40.107 --> 39:42.574
John Berg.

39:44.740 --> 39:47.141
That is not mine.

39:47.208 --> 39:49.141
Biometrics says it is.

39:49.208 --> 39:50.707
Mask I had was clear.

39:50.774 --> 39:51.841
Paid 300 bucks for it.

39:51.907 --> 39:54.574
It's worth it for a ball player.

39:54.640 --> 39:55.841
Former player.

39:55.907 --> 39:57.107
Blew my knee out a year ago.

39:57.174 --> 39:58.473
Haven't played since.

39:58.540 --> 40:00.874
But you kept your locker key, didn't you?

40:00.941 --> 40:03.141
I haven't gone into that locker room in a year.

40:03.208 --> 40:05.241
Just another reminder that I couldn't play.

40:05.308 --> 40:09.107
Well, this mask was found near a crime scene.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.841
I got rid of that mask, threw it away.

40:11.907 --> 40:13.274
Didn't need it.

40:13.340 --> 40:15.674
You didn't until you found another game to play.

40:15.740 --> 40:17.974
No, no, wait.

40:18.041 --> 40:19.907
I'm not one of those guys you're looking for.

40:19.974 --> 40:21.107
I'm no gamer.

40:29.473 --> 40:31.640
Valera, what's up?

40:31.707 --> 40:33.141
John Berg is not our guy.

40:33.208 --> 40:34.974
In fact, our guy is not a guy.

40:35.041 --> 40:36.774
The amylogenin was X-X.

40:36.841 --> 40:38.607
The mask was worn by a female?

40:38.674 --> 40:40.340
Yeah. Well, you were in the bank.

40:40.407 --> 40:41.974
Could a female have pulled that off?

40:42.041 --> 40:47.107
Tech-Nine's pretty much unisex to me.

40:47.174 --> 40:49.574
Thanks, Valera.

40:55.007 --> 40:56.640
Thank you.

40:56.707 --> 40:59.007
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:59.074 --> 41:00.974
I dropped my creds in the melee.

41:01.041 --> 41:03.340
Well, I'm glad to see that you're up and okay.

41:04.407 --> 41:05.640
Heard you met Monica.

41:05.707 --> 41:07.841
Yeah, I did.

41:07.907 --> 41:09.340
She's a nice girl.

41:09.407 --> 41:11.974
Reason I wanted to take you out for drinks was to tell you.

41:12.041 --> 41:13.707
Well, that's not necessary.

41:13.774 --> 41:15.074
I'm happy for you.

41:15.141 --> 41:18.574
I know, it's just, I was so into you, Calleigh,

41:18.640 --> 41:21.340
and... Hagen told me to back off.

41:21.407 --> 41:23.007
John Hagen told you to back off?

41:23.074 --> 41:24.874
Last year, said you two were getting back together.

41:24.941 --> 41:26.107
Showed me a ring and everything.

41:26.174 --> 41:29.841
John was... laboring

41:29.907 --> 41:32.274
under a lot of misconceptions.

41:32.340 --> 41:33.841
You guys weren't...

41:33.907 --> 41:36.373
No.

41:37.407 --> 41:39.507
I should've asked you.

41:39.574 --> 41:41.540
Yeah.

41:41.607 --> 41:42.473
You're mad.

41:42.540 --> 41:44.874
No, um, yes, I am.

41:44.941 --> 41:46.941
Look, personal relationships are very complicated...

41:47.007 --> 41:49.007
No, for business reasons.

41:49.074 --> 41:49.974
What?

41:50.041 --> 41:51.340
Well, to be honest with you,

41:51.407 --> 41:52.640
if this is how you conduct an investigation,

41:52.707 --> 41:54.208
I don't think the girl with the red dye

41:54.274 --> 41:55.440
should've been released from custody.

41:55.507 --> 41:57.208
Kim Mills? I questioned her very thoroughly.

41:57.274 --> 41:58.373
That's what I'm worried about.

41:58.440 --> 41:59.607
I'm just thinking

41:59.674 --> 42:00.874
that your thorough and my thorough

42:00.941 --> 42:02.074
are two very different things.

42:02.141 --> 42:03.507
Will you excuse me?

42:05.274 --> 42:06.807
Homicide, it's Duquesne.

42:06.874 --> 42:09.308
I need you to pick up a young lady for me... Miami University.

42:11.807 --> 42:13.841
I didn't do anything.

42:13.907 --> 42:15.841
You did plenty.

42:15.907 --> 42:19.841
You robbed a bank, you killed a teller.

42:19.907 --> 42:21.340
We have the mask you wore.

42:21.407 --> 42:23.640
It's opaque.

42:23.707 --> 42:25.208
How do you know that?

42:25.274 --> 42:27.174
Because it has your DNA on it.

42:27.241 --> 42:29.141
Whoever wore it left saliva behind.

42:29.208 --> 42:30.740
Our CSIs have a sample of it

42:30.807 --> 42:32.007
as we speak.

42:32.074 --> 42:33.707
Do you care to test yours against it?

42:34.707 --> 42:36.241
Everybody down! Eat the floor!

42:36.308 --> 42:39.041
Eat the floor!

42:39.107 --> 42:40.373
Get down!

42:47.974 --> 42:49.774
No.

42:49.841 --> 42:51.540
I didn't think so.

42:53.841 --> 42:55.874
We, of course, will, for the trial.

43:02.007 --> 43:05.041
The guys play games 24-7.

43:05.107 --> 43:09.373
They don't even look at you if you're not a gamer.

43:09.440 --> 43:12.440
So you were going to outdo them.

43:12.507 --> 43:15.241
I've got more points than any other guy on the board.

43:15.308 --> 43:17.174
Well, you may get credit

43:17.241 --> 43:18.807
for that.

43:18.874 --> 43:21.440
In fact, you may get more time than anyone else in the game

43:21.507 --> 43:22.974
if it makes you proud.
