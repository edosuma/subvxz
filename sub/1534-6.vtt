00:01.927 --> 00:03.311
- Robin: Marian!
- So, how do we break the spell?

00:03.490 --> 00:06.125
- Regina: True love's kiss.
- There's a reason that kiss didn't work.

00:06.256 --> 00:07.456
I'm in love with someone else.

00:07.491 --> 00:08.791
She's still your wife.

00:08.825 --> 00:10.893
Soon I will have what I want.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.795
A family that loves me.

00:19.502 --> 00:22.044
The wall... it's fallen.

00:22.044 --> 00:24.139
We must leave now.
The town will soon be overrun.

00:24.174 --> 00:26.563
These books are too valuable
to leave to those monsters.

00:26.563 --> 00:28.811
- My Lady, please.
- Take these trunks to the carriage.

00:28.845 --> 00:29.878
I'll be just behind you.

00:32.281 --> 00:34.649
- And your daughter?
- I will find her. Now go.

00:34.684 --> 00:37.686
<i>Darling, we must leave, quickly!</i>

00:37.720 --> 00:38.687
Where are you?

00:38.721 --> 00:39.854
Belle: I'm right here, mother!

00:40.556 --> 00:45.193
I'm sorry, but I couldn't
leave without this.

00:45.228 --> 00:48.863
It's the first story you ever
read to me, remember?

00:48.897 --> 00:51.233
It's what made me fall in love with books.

00:51.267 --> 00:52.533
Of course I remember, my Belle.

00:52.567 --> 00:54.769
Quickly, we must flee befo...

00:54.803 --> 00:57.004
- [Rumbling]
- [Gasps]

00:59.141 --> 01:00.441
[Gasps] They're here.

01:00.475 --> 01:02.476
We will hide till they pass.

M...

02:01.704 --> 02:03.815
Belle, why aren't you in bed?

02:03.959 --> 02:07.094
What happened? W-where's mother?

02:07.129 --> 02:09.964
You mean... you don't remember?

02:09.997 --> 02:14.033
Remember what, father? I...

02:48.201 --> 02:50.169
- Belle.
- Hey, I've been...

02:50.203 --> 02:51.837
Been looking all
over the house for you.

02:51.871 --> 02:53.038
Didn't even hear you leave.

02:53.072 --> 02:54.439
Well, I didn't want to wake you.

02:54.473 --> 02:57.075
Just a few things to take
care of before we open.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.576
Well, whatever it is, it'll have to wait.

02:58.611 --> 03:00.913
Emma called. She needs
to see us right away.

03:00.947 --> 03:02.292
[Sighs]

03:04.450 --> 03:06.751
<i>Give it back, Kevin.</i>

03:06.786 --> 03:09.587
<i>The camera is Emma's, not yours.</i>

03:09.622 --> 03:11.423
[Click]

03:11.457 --> 03:13.925
Emma, that's you. You must be...

03:13.959 --> 03:15.134
13, maybe 14.

03:15.134 --> 03:17.531
Are you missing the part where
she's with the Snow Queen?

03:17.555 --> 03:19.403
Emma, you knew her before
you came to Storybrooke?

03:19.403 --> 03:20.818
Apparently my run-in with her in town

03:20.818 --> 03:23.801
wasn't the only memory she erased.

03:23.836 --> 03:25.803
All this time in this foster home,

03:25.838 --> 03:28.472
or whatever that
place was... it's gone.

03:28.506 --> 03:30.407
Look, I-I just don't understand

03:30.442 --> 03:32.609
how she even ended up in this world.

03:32.644 --> 03:34.078
We were hoping Gold could tell us that.

03:34.112 --> 03:35.880
You spent more time trying
to get here than anyone.

03:35.914 --> 03:37.280
How the hell did she do it?

03:37.315 --> 03:38.484
Considering the time I
spent on the same task,

03:38.484 --> 03:39.348
I'd love to know.

03:39.348 --> 03:40.897
Does it really matter how she got to Emma?

03:40.897 --> 03:43.002
I mean, shouldn't we be
more concerned about why?

03:43.139 --> 03:45.606
Obviously, she needed her
for something. But what?

03:45.641 --> 03:48.109
[Scoffs] Well, that's our next problem.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.311
Well, we know she's hiding
somewhere in the north woods.

03:50.345 --> 03:53.113
We combed every inch of her shop.

03:53.148 --> 03:55.316
We tore apart her house.

03:55.350 --> 03:56.651
She must have cleared
everything out days before.

03:56.685 --> 03:58.919
Which means she must be hiding something.

03:58.953 --> 03:59.920
But where?

03:59.954 --> 04:01.656
What about her ice-cream truck?

04:01.690 --> 04:04.825
Whoa, Snow Queen has an ice-cream truck?

04:04.859 --> 04:07.227
I'm a kid. I notice these kind of things.

04:07.262 --> 04:10.998
Then we split up into groups.
We search the town, the woods.

04:11.032 --> 04:12.432
Hook, Regina, Emma, you take the west.

04:12.466 --> 04:14.001
Gold, you're with me for the east.

04:14.035 --> 04:15.969
I think we all know I work best alone.

04:16.004 --> 04:18.805
Well, no time to argue that.
Belle, how are you at tracking?

04:18.839 --> 04:22.342
Uh, actually, I-I think I'll
be more helpful at the library.

04:22.376 --> 04:24.319
Maybe I can dig something
up on the Snow Queen.

04:24.676 --> 04:26.511
I'd like to come with
you, Belle, if that's okay.

04:26.616 --> 04:29.582
Maybe something about my
sister will be there, too.

04:30.335 --> 04:32.057
Unless you'd rather not have the company?

04:32.411 --> 04:35.780
No, n-not at all. I would love some.

04:44.556 --> 04:46.858
It's late.

04:46.892 --> 04:48.259
You should be in bed.

04:48.293 --> 04:51.462
How can I possibly sleep
when I can't even remember

04:51.496 --> 04:52.629
what happened to mother?

04:52.664 --> 04:54.887
- Perhaps that's for the best.
- No!

04:54.887 --> 04:58.088
I need to know what happened
to her after I blacked out.

04:58.123 --> 05:00.792
You won't find the answers you
seek in the pages of a book.

05:00.826 --> 05:03.160
But I already have, father.

05:03.194 --> 05:06.263
According to this, there are creatures

05:06.298 --> 05:09.801
who can restore memories
that have been lost.

05:09.835 --> 05:12.804
If we journey to them, maybe
they can help me remember

05:12.838 --> 05:14.305
what happened to mother.

05:14.339 --> 05:15.705
I can't allow you to do that.

05:15.740 --> 05:17.574
Why not?

05:17.608 --> 05:20.244
Because there's something
this book doesn't tell you.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.547
Magic always comes with a price.

05:23.581 --> 05:25.215
And whatever that price is,

05:25.250 --> 05:27.217
I don't want you to have to pay it.

05:27.252 --> 05:28.350
I'm sorry, Belle,

05:28.983 --> 05:30.550
but I've already lost your mother

05:30.584 --> 05:31.918
to this infernal ogres war.

05:31.953 --> 05:33.920
I can't lose you, too.

05:33.955 --> 05:35.455
- But father...
- You heard me!

05:35.489 --> 05:37.290
No, no!

05:37.324 --> 05:38.458
Forget this nonsense!

05:38.492 --> 05:41.128
You are not to leave this chamber

05:41.162 --> 05:43.830
until the doctors say you're better!

05:46.166 --> 05:48.000
[Door closes]

05:50.337 --> 05:54.140
I'm sorry, father, but I
need to know what happened.

05:54.174 --> 05:57.143
And this...

05:57.177 --> 06:00.647
Is the only place where
I'll find the answer.

06:00.681 --> 06:03.348
Arendelle.

06:08.906 --> 06:11.069
There doesn't seem to be
anything on Arendelle here.

06:11.466 --> 06:12.599
Do you know where to look?

06:12.634 --> 06:13.935
No, I'm... I'm sorry.

06:13.969 --> 06:17.271
I'm... I'm really not that
familiar with Arendelle,

06:17.306 --> 06:19.540
o-or... or your sister.

06:27.515 --> 06:29.983
Elsa?

06:30.017 --> 06:31.552
Anna!

06:31.586 --> 06:32.753
Oh!

06:32.787 --> 06:36.089
Oh, I was worried
I'd never see you again.

06:36.123 --> 06:37.591
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

06:37.625 --> 06:39.289
I'm sorry I left without telling you.

06:39.289 --> 06:41.276
Oh, and I'm sorry I made
you feel like you had to.

06:41.457 --> 06:43.792
I know you did it for me, to
try to make me feel better.

06:43.981 --> 06:45.190
[Sighs]

06:45.980 --> 06:47.848
So, what did you learn?

06:47.882 --> 06:50.318
Did you discover why our parents
went to the enchanted forest?

06:51.953 --> 06:55.255
What is it, Anna? What did you find?

06:55.290 --> 06:56.757
Nothing.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.091
I mean, I'm still waiting on some answers

06:58.126 --> 06:59.459
from a few people I met,

06:59.493 --> 07:01.628
but I wouldn't expect anything anytime soon

07:01.662 --> 07:03.630
because they have to find it out,

07:03.664 --> 07:04.965
then get on a ship and come here.

07:04.999 --> 07:06.900
It could take a while, a long while, and...

07:07.969 --> 07:10.470
Wait, no flurries?

07:10.504 --> 07:12.639
No frost on the windows?

07:12.673 --> 07:14.808
Usually a conversation
about our parents ends

07:14.842 --> 07:16.212
with a chill in the air.

07:16.212 --> 07:18.384
I've been learning to control
my powers when I get upset.

07:18.384 --> 07:20.030
Really? How?

07:20.178 --> 07:22.814
By training with me.

07:22.848 --> 07:24.649
Who is that?

07:24.683 --> 07:27.618
I mean, who are you? I-I mean... Hi.

07:27.653 --> 07:31.455
She's our aunt.

07:31.489 --> 07:33.457
- Our what?
- Your aunt. My name is Ingrid.

07:33.491 --> 07:35.259
Your mother and I were sisters.

07:35.293 --> 07:38.795
You look exactly like her.

07:38.830 --> 07:39.964
[Sighs]

07:40.346 --> 07:42.225
But our mother doesn't have a sister.

07:42.561 --> 07:44.778
At least, she never
told us about one.

07:45.143 --> 07:47.611
I'm sure it was too painful
for her to talk about.

07:48.529 --> 07:49.735
You see, many years ago,

07:49.735 --> 07:51.389
I was trapped in a magical urn by...

07:51.607 --> 07:54.977
People who didn't exactly understand me.

07:55.011 --> 07:57.980
Didn't understand you?

08:01.217 --> 08:04.085
[Whoosh]

08:06.522 --> 08:08.554
Our gift runs in the family.

08:09.626 --> 08:12.094
Anna: I'm telling you, that
woman is up to something.

08:12.129 --> 08:15.131
What, you mean your aunt?
What makes you think that?

08:15.165 --> 08:18.133
'Cause it's weird and
strange, her being here.

08:18.168 --> 08:19.733
And because I'm a good judge of character.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.225
Yeah, says the girl
who agreed to marry Hans

08:21.225 --> 08:22.693
10 minutes after you
started talking to him.

08:22.693 --> 08:24.349
I was young and naive.

08:24.349 --> 08:25.550
You met me the next day.

08:25.584 --> 08:26.950
Young-er.

08:26.985 --> 08:28.286
Anyway, I just want to make sure

08:28.320 --> 08:30.888
we're asking all the right questions.

08:30.922 --> 08:33.657
- Like what?
- Like, is she really even my aunt,

08:33.692 --> 08:35.659
or is she just some imposter

08:35.693 --> 08:38.962
trying to worm her way into our family?

08:38.996 --> 08:41.664
Anna, look at her. You
can't see the resemblance?

08:41.700 --> 08:44.134
Oh, yes, the ice-power
thing, there's that.

08:44.169 --> 08:46.236
Maybe, but if she's really my aunt,

08:46.270 --> 08:47.921
why isn't she in the family portraits,

08:47.921 --> 08:49.229
the royal records?

08:49.229 --> 08:50.235
There's no trace of her.

08:50.235 --> 08:52.369
It's like she never even existed.

08:52.403 --> 08:55.205
There has to be an
explanation for all this.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.107
Yeah? And how do you
think you're gonna find it?

08:57.141 --> 08:58.375
Your family.

08:58.409 --> 08:59.443
Careful.

08:59.477 --> 09:01.945
Grand Pabbie's still a little miffed

09:01.979 --> 09:03.614
that you postponed the wedding.

09:03.648 --> 09:06.616
I can handle grand Pabbie.

09:06.650 --> 09:09.285
Will you go back to the
castle and cover for me...

09:09.319 --> 09:11.154
watch Elsa while I'm gone?

09:11.188 --> 09:13.556
If it'll put your mind at ease, of course.

09:13.590 --> 09:14.657
Oh, but, Kristoff,

09:14.691 --> 09:16.726
you have to be careful
what you say around her.

09:16.761 --> 09:18.228
I...Might not...

09:18.262 --> 09:21.030
I might not exactly have told her

09:21.065 --> 09:23.484
what I discovered in the enchanted forest.

09:23.484 --> 09:25.118
You lied to her?

09:25.152 --> 09:26.286
Ohh, I didn't lie.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.622
I just... withheld the truth.

09:28.656 --> 09:34.093
Telling her our parents wanted
to take away her magic...

09:35.663 --> 09:36.963
I just have to find the right moment.

09:36.997 --> 09:37.997
That's all.

09:38.031 --> 09:41.000
Right, right. Of course. Yeah.

09:41.034 --> 09:44.003
You know I'll support you no matter what.

09:44.037 --> 09:45.704
Unless I think it's really dumb.

09:45.739 --> 09:46.873
Then I'll tell you.

09:46.907 --> 09:50.243
Thank goodness I haven't
hit "really dumb" yet.

09:50.277 --> 09:51.938
Can I get you supplies for your journey?

09:51.938 --> 09:53.239
You're sweet, but no.

09:53.902 --> 09:55.636
I'll stop by oaken's on the way.

09:55.670 --> 09:58.606
You'll see me as soon as I return.

10:18.567 --> 10:20.789
Emma: David, call off the search party.

10:20.789 --> 10:23.190
We found the truck near
the merry men's camp.

10:23.224 --> 10:25.858
Thanks for keeping an eye out.

10:25.893 --> 10:26.993
Gladly.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.329
You're the first sheriff
I don't mind assisting.

10:29.363 --> 10:33.166
Uh, Regina, I was hoping we could talk.

10:33.201 --> 10:34.601
Um, in case you haven't noticed,

10:34.635 --> 10:36.369
I'm about to storm an
evil ice-cream truck.

10:36.404 --> 10:38.067
You could have just said, "maybe later."

10:38.067 --> 10:39.370
I know you're trying to
make everything better,

10:39.370 --> 10:41.196
but staying out of it is your best bet.

10:41.196 --> 10:43.430
It's bad enough I'm stuck
with you and captain guy-liner

10:43.464 --> 10:44.631
making eyes at each other.

10:44.666 --> 10:46.466
I don't make eyes.

10:46.501 --> 10:47.834
Ready, love?

10:47.868 --> 10:50.404
[Sighs]

10:52.039 --> 10:54.374
It appears she beat us to it.

10:56.944 --> 10:57.992
She's cleared out the vessel.

10:57.992 --> 10:59.414
What now?

10:59.414 --> 11:01.448
Should we question the
cows she gets her milk from?

11:01.483 --> 11:03.584
Maybe search the waffle-cone factory?

11:03.618 --> 11:05.944
Hang on. Look. Who locks their freezer?

11:05.944 --> 11:07.593
Was she afraid someone was
gonna steal the Rocky road?

11:07.622 --> 11:08.622
Stand back.

11:21.599 --> 11:24.515
Looks like the dairy Queen's
been following me for a long time.

11:24.549 --> 11:26.117
Since before foster care?

11:26.151 --> 11:28.519
Since I landed in this world.

11:30.988 --> 11:33.157
Belle: Are you okay?

11:35.059 --> 11:36.202
This is pointless.

11:36.610 --> 11:37.506
I don't know why I thought

11:37.506 --> 11:38.927
I'd find anything about Anna in here.

11:38.927 --> 11:41.663
You know she's somewhere.
You know she's alive.

11:41.697 --> 11:46.433
You heard her heartbeat
with Bo-peep's staff, right?

11:46.467 --> 11:48.269
But if what the Snow Queen told me is true

11:48.303 --> 11:50.504
and Anna is the one who put me in that urn,

11:50.538 --> 11:52.239
then maybe she doesn't want me to find her.

11:52.274 --> 11:53.373
That's not true, Elsa.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.521
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

11:54.521 --> 11:56.489
No, I promise you, I'm not.

11:56.523 --> 11:58.825
How would you know what my sister thinks?

11:58.859 --> 12:00.560
You've never even met her.

12:00.594 --> 12:04.229
Well, just from what you've been saying,

12:04.264 --> 12:06.532
I-I feel like I know her.

12:06.567 --> 12:08.531
You two were very close.

12:09.092 --> 12:10.441
Something must have
pulled you apart...

12:10.441 --> 12:12.204
something beyond your control.

12:12.238 --> 12:13.873
[Voice breaking] But my memories are gone,

12:13.907 --> 12:16.342
and no one in this town
has even been to Arendelle.

12:16.376 --> 12:18.177
I need to face the truth, Belle.

12:18.211 --> 12:19.678
No one here can help me,

12:19.712 --> 12:24.383
and I'm afraid that means I
might never see Anna again.

12:24.417 --> 12:26.501
[Sighs] Okay.

12:27.328 --> 12:28.492
You will.

12:28.492 --> 12:29.309
[Scoffs]

12:29.309 --> 12:30.021
I know it.

12:30.184 --> 12:33.352
Now, keep looking. I'll be back.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.755
What? Where are you going?

12:35.789 --> 12:38.791
There's something I-I
need to take care of.

12:38.826 --> 12:42.795
We will find Anna.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.869
You want to find trolls?

12:50.903 --> 12:52.281
You know they're dangerous, yeah?

12:52.281 --> 12:55.107
Oh, no, no, no. Rock
trolls, not bridge trolls.

12:55.141 --> 12:56.842
Oh, yeah, they're quite nice.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.844
So, you can... you
can direct me to them?

12:58.878 --> 13:00.812
No. I've never met them.

13:00.847 --> 13:01.880
Yoo-hoo!

13:01.914 --> 13:03.849
But y-you just said they were nice.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.117
I've heard.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.618
[Sighs]

13:06.652 --> 13:08.638
Please help me. I-I
just lost my mother.

13:09.037 --> 13:10.306
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

13:11.244 --> 13:12.527
Uh, trolls can't bring life.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.626
But I can help soothe you.

13:15.661 --> 13:17.428
Have you tried the sauna?

13:17.462 --> 13:21.365
Uh, no, no. Thank you.

13:24.102 --> 13:26.970
<i>Anna: Need some help?</i>

13:28.607 --> 13:33.411
Uh, well, I was trying to
find my way to the rock trolls,

13:33.445 --> 13:36.414
but this map is not being too helpful.

13:36.448 --> 13:37.915
Oaken means well.

13:37.949 --> 13:40.884
<i>- Yeah!</i>
- But you don't need him or a map.

13:40.919 --> 13:42.019
I can help you.

13:42.053 --> 13:44.855
I'm on my way to see them. Come with me.

13:44.889 --> 13:46.256
Really?

13:47.225 --> 13:49.359
[Laughing] Thank you.

13:49.393 --> 13:50.627
Uh, I'm Belle.

13:50.661 --> 13:52.295
I'm Anna.

13:52.330 --> 13:55.098
Friend of Anna's? Half price on the sauna.

14:06.957 --> 14:08.416
- [Sighs]
- I can't help but think

14:08.416 --> 14:09.971
- you're avoiding me.
- [Sighs]

14:11.731 --> 14:14.366
Well, not very well, it seems.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.668
You're upset because
of what I said...

14:16.702 --> 14:18.703
that I'm still in love with you.

14:18.738 --> 14:21.072
I suppose I should never have told you,

14:21.107 --> 14:24.075
not after I asked you
to find a way to save my wife.

14:24.110 --> 14:25.744
That's not why I'm avoiding you.

14:25.778 --> 14:27.578
Then why can't you even look me in the eye?

14:27.613 --> 14:30.915
Because I don't know how
to tell you the truth.

14:30.950 --> 14:33.451
You know you can tell me anything.

14:33.485 --> 14:36.181
I've read every spell
book in my possession,

14:36.181 --> 14:38.410
experimented with every potion in my vault.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.611
I even tried to defeat the Snow Queen

14:40.645 --> 14:43.314
so I could force her to reverse the spell.

14:43.349 --> 14:45.947
But... Nothing I do seems good enough.

14:45.947 --> 14:49.249
But it will be, Regina.
I have faith in you.

14:49.283 --> 14:51.084
You will figure out a way eventually.

14:51.119 --> 14:54.420
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

14:54.455 --> 14:57.023
I'm not sure I can figure it out.

14:58.725 --> 15:00.193
Robin, I'm sorry,

15:00.227 --> 15:02.720
but if you truly want to save Marian...

15:05.992 --> 15:08.727
You're gonna have to forget about me...

15:08.761 --> 15:12.965
And... Find a way...

15:12.999 --> 15:17.937
To fall in love with your wife again.

15:27.512 --> 15:30.814
You can show yourself, dearie.

15:30.848 --> 15:33.483
I'm not the one you're hiding from.

15:33.518 --> 15:35.886
No, you're not.

15:35.920 --> 15:39.722
To what do I owe this intrusion?

15:39.756 --> 15:42.558
A warning.

15:42.592 --> 15:44.593
Emma Swan is onto you.

15:45.662 --> 15:47.297
She knows your history began

15:47.331 --> 15:49.865
long before you came to Storybrooke.

15:49.900 --> 15:51.700
I'm aware.

15:51.735 --> 15:54.304
Do you really think she
would have discovered that

15:54.338 --> 15:56.872
if I hadn't wanted her to?

15:56.907 --> 15:58.842
It's all part of my plan...

15:58.842 --> 16:01.100
a plan you thankfully know little about.

16:01.615 --> 16:03.650
You're being awfully secretive.

16:03.684 --> 16:05.485
You didn't come to warn me.

16:05.519 --> 16:07.320
You came to find out my secrets.

16:07.354 --> 16:12.257
Or offer up a deal.
Whatever suits you best.

16:12.292 --> 16:16.696
But if you decline, I'd be careful.

16:18.298 --> 16:20.499
There it is.

16:20.533 --> 16:23.502
There's the warning.

16:23.536 --> 16:26.005
You want something out of me?

16:26.039 --> 16:28.503
Why don't you just ask for it?

16:28.503 --> 16:30.470
If I wanted something out of you, dearie,

16:30.505 --> 16:31.805
believe me, I'd take it.

16:31.839 --> 16:35.475
But you can't, can you?
Otherwise you would.

16:35.510 --> 16:38.645
You and I both know...
to get what you want,

16:38.679 --> 16:42.649
you need one thing that I have
and you're sorely lacking...

16:42.683 --> 16:44.150
leverage.

16:44.184 --> 16:48.154
And until you get that...

16:48.188 --> 16:50.456
I have a warning for you.

16:50.491 --> 16:53.159
Stay out of my way.

16:53.193 --> 16:56.695
[Breathing heavily]

17:04.554 --> 17:07.176
Don't worry, Anna. I'll find you.

17:08.063 --> 17:10.330
So, Belle...

17:10.365 --> 17:11.699
I couldn't help overhearing...

17:11.733 --> 17:14.702
Well, actually, I could,
but I'm naturally curious.

17:14.737 --> 17:19.039
Anyway... I heard you lost your mother.

17:19.073 --> 17:22.640
Yes, in the... in the ogres war.

17:23.059 --> 17:25.228
I'm so sorry.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.765
I lost mine, too.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.934
There are no words.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.668
[Sighs] No, there aren't,

17:33.703 --> 17:36.304
especially when you don't
know what happened.

17:36.339 --> 17:40.809
I was hoping the rock trolls
could restore my memory

17:40.844 --> 17:44.012
so that I can finally be at peace.

17:44.047 --> 17:46.381
Sometimes the answer isn't what you want.

17:46.415 --> 17:47.982
Which is what?

17:48.016 --> 17:51.486
One that makes you feel better.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.988
But if grand Pabbie can
help you get what you need,

17:54.022 --> 17:55.790
I'll make sure he does.

17:55.824 --> 17:57.726
Thank you.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.962
Uh... So, now what?

18:02.159 --> 18:04.839
Now we climb.

18:05.162 --> 18:07.130
Okay.

18:07.164 --> 18:08.231
[Grunts]

18:08.265 --> 18:10.233
[Laughs]

18:10.267 --> 18:11.534
Belle: Okay.

18:16.106 --> 18:18.074
- [Screams]
- [Gasps]

18:18.108 --> 18:19.775
You okay?

18:19.810 --> 18:21.109
- Ohh.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:21.144 --> 18:23.905
Whoo! Oh!

18:23.905 --> 18:26.574
Kristoff makes this look easy!

18:26.608 --> 18:27.875
[Sighs]

18:27.909 --> 18:29.543
Here.

18:29.578 --> 18:30.645
Careful! Careful.

18:30.679 --> 18:32.399
Why? W-what's inside?

18:32.399 --> 18:34.032
A hat which can strip the magic

18:34.066 --> 18:36.667
from the most powerful of sorcerers.

18:36.702 --> 18:38.836
Why do you have such a thing?

18:38.871 --> 18:41.006
I sort of stole it from an evil sorcerer

18:41.040 --> 18:43.641
when I was back in
the enchanted forest.

18:43.675 --> 18:45.810
[Sighs] I went to him
to help with my sister,

18:45.844 --> 18:48.980
but things didn't exactly
go according to plan.

18:49.015 --> 18:51.482
Why? What... what happened?

18:51.517 --> 18:53.651
Who... who is this person?

18:53.685 --> 18:55.983
I-I'd really rather not get into it.

18:55.983 --> 18:57.742
The less you know, the better.

18:57.742 --> 19:01.512
I just pray you never cross
paths with that twisted man.

19:01.546 --> 19:03.114
[Door bells jingle]

19:03.148 --> 19:04.215
Belle.

19:04.249 --> 19:06.717
[Door closes] Where are you headed?

19:06.751 --> 19:11.054
To the north woods, where
the Snow Queen's hiding.

19:11.088 --> 19:13.323
And what business do you have with her?

19:13.357 --> 19:16.493
I have to fix a mistake
that I made a long time ago.

19:16.528 --> 19:18.662
What are you talking about?

19:18.696 --> 19:20.556
I'm afraid I can't tell
you. You wouldn't understand.

19:20.556 --> 19:21.923
Whether or not that's true,

19:21.957 --> 19:24.425
the fact remains that she
defeated both Emma and Regina.

19:24.459 --> 19:26.928
She is far more dangerous than you realize.

19:26.962 --> 19:29.097
I know.

19:29.131 --> 19:31.766
That's why I was... I was
hoping you'd come with me.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.601
[Scoffs] I'm sorry, Belle.

19:33.635 --> 19:35.369
That's out of the question.

19:35.403 --> 19:37.872
I won't let you anywhere near her.

19:37.906 --> 19:41.174
I was worried you were gonna say that.

19:41.209 --> 19:47.348
Because... I really...

19:47.382 --> 19:49.916
Really didn't want to do this.

19:53.421 --> 19:56.884
Bell, I gave you that dagger
because I trusted you...

19:58.090 --> 19:59.828
because I thought you
would never want to control me.

20:00.012 --> 20:03.448
I know. I know, and
I'm so, so sorry, Rumple.

20:03.482 --> 20:05.850
But if you won't come with me willingly,

20:05.885 --> 20:09.020
what choice do I have?

20:15.360 --> 20:18.796
Take me to the Snow Queen.

20:24.496 --> 20:25.529
<i>Emma: According to this,</i>

20:25.529 --> 20:27.580
<i>she was my foster parent for six months.</i>

20:27.580 --> 20:28.781
Aye?

20:28.975 --> 20:30.498
That's the longest I was ever in one spot,

20:30.498 --> 20:33.699
but I don't remember a second of it.

20:33.733 --> 20:34.800
You all right, Swan?

20:34.834 --> 20:36.738
I'm fine. It was all a long time ago.

20:36.738 --> 20:38.859
Mm, perhaps, but wounds that
are made when we're young

20:38.859 --> 20:40.545
- tend to linger.
- How would you know?

20:40.545 --> 20:42.379
Believe it or not, I was once a child.

20:42.413 --> 20:44.113
Yeah, like a million years ago.

20:44.148 --> 20:45.892
It was more like 200.

20:51.421 --> 20:54.057
What is it?

20:54.795 --> 20:57.229
It's a painting I did when I was in school.

20:57.264 --> 20:58.546
That so surprising?

20:58.546 --> 20:59.746
It's not the only one.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.648
This crazy woman has a whole file

21:01.682 --> 21:05.484
of my old art projects and essays.

21:05.518 --> 21:08.487
Just like the one I have for Henry.

21:08.521 --> 21:10.422
You don't keep stuff like this

21:10.457 --> 21:12.358
unless you care about someone.

21:12.392 --> 21:14.693
Well, perhaps the Snow Queen
wasn't simply using you.

21:14.728 --> 21:16.618
Perhaps she'd grown fond of you over time.

21:17.492 --> 21:19.133
Looks like the feeling was mutual.

21:19.133 --> 21:20.843
"Thanks for being the family I never had."

21:20.877 --> 21:22.344
"Love, Emma."

21:22.378 --> 21:24.579
I wrote that to her.

21:24.614 --> 21:27.283
Looks like you two were close once.

21:27.317 --> 21:29.852
But she still erased my memories.

21:29.886 --> 21:30.852
Something must have
happened to change all that.

21:30.869 --> 21:32.502
There has to be a clue as to why.

21:33.635 --> 21:37.171
Perhaps there is... If
you can read hieroglyphs.

21:41.716 --> 21:42.858
This isn't from our world.

21:44.861 --> 21:48.430
What the hell was she doing with me?

21:48.464 --> 21:49.594
This is it?

21:49.938 --> 21:51.038
This is where she's hiding?

21:51.073 --> 21:54.575
Indeed. But she's not at home.

21:54.609 --> 21:56.243
I don't sense her magic.

21:56.277 --> 21:57.978
Good.

21:58.012 --> 22:02.216
Okay. You stay here as
lookout. I'm going in.

22:02.250 --> 22:04.751
No, Belle, y-you're not
going in there alone.

22:04.785 --> 22:07.554
Look, I won't be long. I
just need to find something.

22:07.589 --> 22:11.224
What could you possibly want
from the Snow Queen's cave?

22:11.258 --> 22:12.763
A hat...

22:13.127 --> 22:17.058
one that can strip a magical
being of their powers.

22:19.309 --> 22:21.944
That sounds like a
remarkable object...

22:21.978 --> 22:24.779
almost too good to be true,
which means it probably is.

22:24.814 --> 22:26.381
It isn't, and I know she has it,

22:26.415 --> 22:27.882
and I need to get it from her.

22:27.916 --> 22:31.052
It's the only way to force
her to tell us where Anna is.

22:31.086 --> 22:33.321
So this is about Elsa's sister?

22:33.356 --> 22:36.224
Why are you so invested in
a girl you've never even met?

22:36.258 --> 22:40.160
Because a hero always helps strangers.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.176
Now keep watch.

22:42.374 --> 22:45.761
I'll call out to you if I need your help.

22:49.932 --> 22:53.067
Grand Pabbie?

22:53.101 --> 22:56.136
<i>Grand Pabbie, it's me!</i>

22:59.574 --> 23:02.909
Ooh, Anna, my dear, you're back!

23:02.944 --> 23:06.113
Have you come to tell
us the new wedding date?

23:06.147 --> 23:07.948
I have been working on my speech.

23:07.982 --> 23:10.617
Not yet, but we can get into that later.

23:10.651 --> 23:13.386
First, I want you to meet my friend Belle.

23:13.420 --> 23:15.689
She's come a long way to see you.

23:19.460 --> 23:21.995
It's an honor to meet you.

23:24.298 --> 23:26.779
I'm, uh... I'm here because I-I...

23:26.779 --> 23:28.352
I know.

23:28.352 --> 23:31.066
I can help you get the
memories of your mother.

23:31.066 --> 23:34.020
[Whoosh]

23:38.804 --> 23:41.447
Take this to the place
where you lost your memory,

23:41.641 --> 23:45.611
then brew a tea with
the stone in the kettle.

23:45.645 --> 23:48.948
When you drink it, your
memories will return.

23:48.982 --> 23:51.316
Thank you.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.688
[Sighs]

23:55.722 --> 23:57.892
Thank you, Anna. I-I owe you, as well.

23:57.892 --> 24:00.491
- How can I repay you?
- You don't have to.

24:00.491 --> 24:02.392
Having a new friend is payment enough.

24:02.426 --> 24:04.394
All I need is a moment alone with Pabbie.

24:04.428 --> 24:05.551
I'll be quick.

24:05.984 --> 24:08.011
What can I help you with, dear?

24:08.011 --> 24:09.812
Some woman claims to be my aunt.

24:09.847 --> 24:11.296
[Sighs] I just don't believe her!

24:12.237 --> 24:13.951
Mother would have told
us if she had a sister.

24:14.116 --> 24:18.008
Actually, she had two sisters.

24:18.043 --> 24:20.511
Wait. What?

24:20.546 --> 24:22.980
Mother had two sisters
that she never spoke about?

24:23.014 --> 24:24.515
Why didn't she say anything?

24:24.550 --> 24:26.117
Why didn't you say anything?

24:26.151 --> 24:29.019
Because I was sworn to secrecy.

24:29.054 --> 24:32.522
Grand Pabbie, I need some answers.

24:32.557 --> 24:34.024
Please.

24:34.059 --> 24:35.859
[Sighs]

24:35.894 --> 24:38.729
Your mother, Gerda,
was the youngest of three.

24:38.763 --> 24:43.033
And then there was Helga,
and Ingrid was the oldest.

24:43.068 --> 24:46.804
As children, the three
girls were quite close,

24:46.838 --> 24:50.207
often seen playing together
in the royal gardens.

24:50.241 --> 24:53.088
But then, one day,
Helga and Ingrid vanished.

24:53.088 --> 24:56.290
No one ever knew what happened to them.

24:56.324 --> 25:00.327
It was a tragedy the royal
family wanted to forget.

25:00.362 --> 25:03.431
And they did, with my help.

25:03.465 --> 25:05.570
You took the memories of
everyone in Arendelle?

25:05.636 --> 25:06.466
Yes.

25:06.467 --> 25:10.938
And the royal family erased
mention of Helga and Ingrid

25:10.972 --> 25:14.575
from every book and record
they could find in our realm.

25:14.609 --> 25:16.193
Why wouldn't Ingrid tell me what happened,

25:16.193 --> 25:17.614
or that she had another sister?

25:17.614 --> 25:20.249
Those are questions you'd
have to ask your aunt.

25:20.283 --> 25:21.883
[Sighs] Like she would tell me.

25:21.917 --> 25:23.485
If she's keeping these secrets,

25:23.519 --> 25:25.120
who knows what else she's hiding.

25:25.154 --> 25:26.955
I have to warn Elsa.

25:26.989 --> 25:29.291
Belle, we have to go!

25:29.325 --> 25:31.126
What? Is everything okay?

25:31.160 --> 25:32.961
I don't think so.

25:32.995 --> 25:35.997
It's my aunt. She's up to something.

25:39.735 --> 25:42.403
The hat must be in here somewhere.

25:44.863 --> 25:46.773
Woman: [Echoing] Belle.

25:47.197 --> 25:49.034
Belle. Belle!

25:50.780 --> 25:54.248
Over here, Belle.

25:54.283 --> 25:57.418
Over here, Belle.

25:59.888 --> 26:02.723
Over... Here.

26:10.762 --> 26:13.029
Hello, Belle!

26:13.063 --> 26:14.581
[Gasps]

26:15.016 --> 26:17.151
I was hoping you'd find me.

26:22.646 --> 26:24.305
I wish I didn't have to wait to use this.

26:24.459 --> 26:25.752
You'll be home before you know it.

26:25.752 --> 26:26.671
As soon as we get to town,

26:26.671 --> 26:28.951
we'll put you on the first ship
back to the enchanted forest.

26:29.225 --> 26:30.903
[Wind blows, thunder rumbles]

26:31.086 --> 26:33.454
If any ships are even setting sail.

26:33.488 --> 26:37.157
It... Looks like a storm's setting in.

26:37.192 --> 26:39.659
I don't think it's a storm.

26:39.694 --> 26:42.296
Well, what else could it be?

26:42.330 --> 26:44.798
My aunt.

26:44.832 --> 26:46.967
I don't think my aunt
wants me to tell my sister

26:47.001 --> 26:48.468
what I found out.

26:48.502 --> 26:52.138
Well, if she... has
all this magic and...

26:52.172 --> 26:54.089
And you have, well,
g-good intentions,

26:54.089 --> 26:55.556
then what are we gonna do?

26:55.590 --> 26:57.558
I have more than good intentions!

26:57.592 --> 26:58.692
I have this!

26:58.727 --> 27:01.329
She can't hurt us if
she doesn't have magic.

27:01.363 --> 27:02.596
[Wind gusts]

27:02.630 --> 27:03.630
[Screams]

27:04.198 --> 27:05.966
[Grunts]

27:10.638 --> 27:12.573
Belle!

27:12.607 --> 27:14.146
Belle!

27:14.146 --> 27:15.722
I can't pull myself up!

27:19.509 --> 27:21.643
Just hold on! I'll be right there!

27:21.677 --> 27:24.480
Belle, hurry! Please!

27:27.917 --> 27:30.019
Oh! [Gasps]

27:32.355 --> 27:34.656
Belle, hurry!

27:36.726 --> 27:38.393
I'm coming!

27:39.729 --> 27:43.231
I'm coming.

27:43.265 --> 27:44.733
[Grunts]

27:44.767 --> 27:47.035
- [Screams]
- Anna!

28:05.031 --> 28:06.399
Leave her alone!

28:09.803 --> 28:15.941
You'll have to excuse us,
but this is family business.

28:24.183 --> 28:26.652
Mirror Belle: I'm surprised
you were brave enough

28:26.686 --> 28:27.986
to come in here.

28:28.020 --> 28:29.655
I had to.

28:29.689 --> 28:32.123
I have to find a way to help Anna.

28:32.158 --> 28:34.626
Why? [Scoffs]

28:34.661 --> 28:37.296
You never really cared much for her before.

28:37.330 --> 28:38.997
That's not true.

28:39.031 --> 28:42.023
Sure, it is. You chose
that rock over her.

28:42.909 --> 28:47.045
You had to remember what
happened to your mother,

28:47.080 --> 28:49.281
no matter what the cost.

28:49.315 --> 28:52.284
I made a mistake.

28:52.318 --> 28:53.451
I didn't mean to...

28:53.451 --> 28:56.542
Ruin someone's life? [Scoffs]

28:56.542 --> 28:59.043
It certainly wasn't
your most heroic moment.

28:59.078 --> 29:03.281
Not that you've ever
really been hero material.

29:03.315 --> 29:07.686
No, please... please stop.

29:07.720 --> 29:11.055
Everyone sees you for what
you really are, Belle...

29:11.090 --> 29:15.059
a pathetic coward.

29:15.094 --> 29:18.329
I mean, why do you think
the dark one married you?

29:18.364 --> 29:21.499
You think it was love?

29:21.533 --> 29:25.836
He needed someone weak,
someone he could manipulate.

29:25.871 --> 29:30.007
That's not true. He
loves me. He gave me this.

29:30.041 --> 29:31.842
[Laughs]

29:31.877 --> 29:35.813
You truly believe that's real?

29:35.847 --> 29:38.248
Deep down,

29:38.282 --> 29:41.986
you know what kind of
beast you're dealing with.

29:43.490 --> 29:46.218
Belle! Belle.

29:46.855 --> 29:49.056
The Snow Queen's approaching the cave.

29:52.694 --> 29:54.428
- Belle.
- [Gasps]

29:54.463 --> 29:55.930
Look at me.

29:55.964 --> 29:58.466
Don't look in the mirror. Look at me.

29:59.834 --> 30:00.834
We have to leave.

30:02.803 --> 30:04.180
- [Grunting]
- Let me go!

30:04.180 --> 30:06.169
- You don't know what you're doing.
- No!

30:08.576 --> 30:10.477
- Please, let me go!
- It's okay.

30:10.511 --> 30:12.679
- Let... let me go!
- It's okay. We're back in the shop.

30:12.713 --> 30:14.481
- We're back in the shop. It's okay.
- No, no!

30:14.515 --> 30:16.148
- It's okay.
- Wait. No.

30:16.183 --> 30:19.486
You were outside the cave.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.075
I commanded that you wait there.

30:21.075 --> 30:22.456
You commanded me to keep watch.

30:22.456 --> 30:24.023
I sensed she was coming back.

30:24.058 --> 30:26.059
I came to find you, and I'm glad I did.

30:31.131 --> 30:32.565
[Knife clatters]

30:32.599 --> 30:35.034
[Voice breaking] I... I hurt you.

30:35.069 --> 30:36.335
I...

30:37.871 --> 30:40.339
I'm so sorry, Rumple.

30:40.373 --> 30:42.175
It's okay.

30:42.209 --> 30:45.678
When I f-found that mirror,
something came over me,

30:45.713 --> 30:47.580
like a... like a spell.

30:47.614 --> 30:50.916
And... and it spoke
to me and made me...

30:50.950 --> 30:53.419
made me believe all these horrible things,

30:53.453 --> 30:58.724
and it said to me that the
dagger you gave me is fake.

30:58.758 --> 31:02.394
[Sniffles]

31:02.429 --> 31:07.032
I can assure you that nothing
that mirror said is true.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.467
It was imbued with
the darkest of magic.

31:09.501 --> 31:13.471
I-I know you would never wrong me.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.974
<i>I have wronged you.</i>

31:16.008 --> 31:19.277
I've kept a terrible secret from you.

31:21.079 --> 31:25.916
I'm the reason... that Anna's missing.

31:25.951 --> 31:29.086
I didn't want anyone to know

31:29.121 --> 31:33.491
until I could make things
right and save Anna.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.617
But I couldn't. I failed.

31:35.989 --> 31:38.958
And all I managed to
do was abuse the dagger

31:38.992 --> 31:44.130
and... and take advantage
of you, my true love.

31:44.165 --> 31:47.133
I-I don't even
know if I...

31:47.168 --> 31:50.370
if I deserve to be with you anymore.

31:50.404 --> 31:53.238
No, no, no. You were only doing
what you thought was right.

31:54.908 --> 31:56.876
You... you forgive me?

31:56.910 --> 31:59.645
Of course I forgive you.

31:59.680 --> 32:02.381
[Crying]

32:02.415 --> 32:04.550
Thank you for telling me everything.

32:04.585 --> 32:07.352
Thank you for understanding.

32:07.387 --> 32:11.256
I never should have kept a secret from you,

32:11.291 --> 32:12.924
especially 'cause I know

32:12.959 --> 32:15.594
that you'd never keep one from me.

32:15.628 --> 32:18.130
I love you, Rumple.

32:20.833 --> 32:23.102
And I love you, too.

32:27.961 --> 32:28.961
[Sighs]

32:32.843 --> 32:34.821
Father, I... [clears throat]

32:34.821 --> 32:36.530
I-I thought you'd be asleep.

32:37.076 --> 32:38.561
I haven't slept in days.

32:39.587 --> 32:44.057
How could I when you left
without so much as a goodbye?

32:44.091 --> 32:48.228
So, did you find what
you were looking for?

32:48.262 --> 32:50.730
No.

32:50.764 --> 32:52.465
You were right, father.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.198
I should have just left things alone.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.667
That trip was a huge mistake.

32:56.702 --> 32:58.769
I'm the one who's made the mistake, Belle.

32:58.804 --> 33:03.240
I've been keeping a secret from you.

33:05.143 --> 33:07.945
I know what happened
during the ogre attack.

33:07.980 --> 33:10.280
Wait, what?!

33:10.315 --> 33:12.016
I didn't want to add to your grief.

33:13.819 --> 33:16.453
When the ogres stormed the library

33:16.488 --> 33:18.288
where you and your mother had been working,

33:18.323 --> 33:19.689
the guards heard the commotion.

33:19.724 --> 33:22.526
They rushed in. They saw the
ogres were about to attack.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.894
But your mother, she...

33:23.928 --> 33:28.899
she stood in the path of
those monsters to protect you.

33:28.933 --> 33:29.822
She kept them at bay

33:29.822 --> 33:31.593
while the guards pulled you from danger.

33:31.593 --> 33:33.794
But by the time they came
to save your mother...

33:33.828 --> 33:36.597
It was too late.

33:38.333 --> 33:42.869
She sacrificed herself for me.

33:42.904 --> 33:47.074
She loved you so much, and so do I.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.441
I'm so glad you're back.

33:48.475 --> 33:50.276
I don't know what I would have done

33:50.311 --> 33:52.086
if the ogres had gotten you on the road.

33:52.086 --> 33:54.652
They... they have
reached the roads?

33:55.890 --> 33:57.768
The war is not going well.

33:58.064 --> 34:00.798
But you need not worry of such things.

34:00.833 --> 34:02.867
We have soldiers to fight.

34:02.902 --> 34:05.770
But those soldiers don't stand a chance.

34:05.804 --> 34:09.273
They'll only slow down the ogres' advance.

34:09.306 --> 34:10.542
[Sighs]

34:10.576 --> 34:14.712
We need someone who can
stop them once and for all.

34:14.746 --> 34:16.748
And who would that be?

34:19.083 --> 34:22.886
On my journey, I did some reading.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.588
And, well...

34:26.226 --> 34:29.830
There's a wizard,
a powerful, powerful wizard,

34:29.987 --> 34:31.570
who may just help us.

34:31.763 --> 34:34.164
- His name is...
- I know his name!

34:34.197 --> 34:36.567
And I dare not speak it.

34:36.601 --> 34:37.844
Trust me, Belle, if we do...

34:37.844 --> 34:42.983
I know. Magic always comes with a price.

34:43.016 --> 34:44.083
[Sighs]

34:44.118 --> 34:46.587
But if mother's death taught me anything,

34:46.621 --> 34:51.257
it's that sometimes a hero
has to sacrifice everything

34:51.292 --> 34:53.458
to save the people they love,

34:53.494 --> 34:57.664
and I will do whatever
I can to save our land.

34:57.698 --> 34:59.770
And I can be a hero, just like mother.

35:00.538 --> 35:05.508
And if that means
summoning Rumplestiltskin...

35:05.542 --> 35:07.377
Then so be it.

35:12.161 --> 35:15.631
I'm afraid we have a problem, dearie.

35:15.665 --> 35:18.800
I caught a glimpse of your mirror today.

35:18.835 --> 35:22.804
It's rather impressive, isn't it?

35:22.839 --> 35:27.675
I had no idea your bride
would be so easy to turn.

35:27.710 --> 35:29.577
Watch yourself.

35:29.612 --> 35:33.143
Now, I don't know exactly when
you intend to use this mirror,

35:33.143 --> 35:36.278
but you should know this.

35:36.312 --> 35:38.947
I won't allow you to hurt
those I care about.

35:38.981 --> 35:41.416
And I won't allow you to derail my plans

35:41.451 --> 35:43.985
because you've suddenly gotten sentimental.

35:44.019 --> 35:45.487
You only get one warning.

35:45.521 --> 35:47.756
Which is more than you get.

35:47.790 --> 35:50.091
I can't make any promises

35:50.126 --> 35:52.527
over who may or who may not survive.

35:52.562 --> 35:57.632
You know, you were wrong before.

35:57.666 --> 36:00.769
That you needed leverage
to get what you want?

36:00.803 --> 36:01.967
No, that I didn't have it.

36:02.166 --> 36:03.323
I do.

36:07.639 --> 36:08.771
Where did you get that?

36:08.806 --> 36:10.273
Oh, that's irrelevant.

36:10.308 --> 36:12.275
But now that I know what you're up to,

36:12.310 --> 36:14.277
we can have a real talk.

36:14.312 --> 36:18.848
You might want to reconsider your position,

36:18.883 --> 36:20.850
because I doubt you'd enjoy

36:20.885 --> 36:23.269
becoming just another
embroidery on this hat.

36:24.497 --> 36:27.933
Looks like you've just
lost your leverage, dearie.

36:30.069 --> 36:32.538
Anna.

36:32.572 --> 36:34.973
It's time to wake up, dear.

36:35.007 --> 36:37.142
What?

36:37.176 --> 36:39.645
Where am I?

36:39.679 --> 36:41.846
Exactly where you belong.

36:44.417 --> 36:45.417
[Bars clatter]

36:46.393 --> 36:49.695
You can't just lock me in
here! Elsa won't stand for it!

36:49.730 --> 36:51.864
Even when she finds out what
you were planning to do to her?

36:51.898 --> 36:53.766
Wait. What?

36:53.800 --> 36:55.701
You were planning to use
this to strip away her magic.

36:55.736 --> 36:57.702
No, that's not why I had it.

36:57.737 --> 37:00.792
Really? Then why didn't
you tell Elsa about it?

37:00.792 --> 37:04.327
Because I-I didn't know
how to tell her the truth.

37:05.484 --> 37:07.919
I found it with a man
that our parents sought out.

37:07.953 --> 37:09.687
They went to him looking for a way

37:09.722 --> 37:12.156
to strip Elsa of the thing
that makes her special.

37:12.190 --> 37:13.958
And you're following in their footsteps.

37:13.992 --> 37:15.459
I wasn't going to use it on her.

37:15.493 --> 37:17.594
I wasn't going to use it on anybody...

37:17.629 --> 37:21.098
Until you attacked me.

37:21.133 --> 37:24.101
The rock trolls told me
what you've been hiding,

37:24.136 --> 37:26.804
that you and my mother had another sister.

37:26.838 --> 37:28.939
The rock trolls shouldn't
talk about things

37:28.973 --> 37:30.441
that they don't understand.

37:30.475 --> 37:31.775
But it's true.

37:31.810 --> 37:33.944
What happened to her?

37:33.978 --> 37:38.114
Some secrets are better left buried.

37:38.149 --> 37:39.459
I don't understand.

37:39.881 --> 37:41.815
What do you want?!

37:45.619 --> 37:48.287
What I have always wanted...

37:51.759 --> 37:58.097
a family who will
embrace me for who I am.

37:58.131 --> 38:01.367
For a brief moment,

38:01.401 --> 38:04.036
I thought the three of
us could be that family...

38:04.071 --> 38:05.642
you, me, and Elsa.

38:05.642 --> 38:11.045
But you showed me
that plan would never work.

38:11.080 --> 38:15.384
You have nothing in
common with Elsa and me.

38:15.418 --> 38:18.386
You are the odd woman out.

38:18.420 --> 38:24.725
And now I suppose
I have to find someone else

38:24.760 --> 38:26.560
to take your place.

38:26.595 --> 38:29.630
The Snow Queen is your aunt?

38:29.665 --> 38:31.966
According to this heraldry
book I found in the library.

38:32.001 --> 38:33.663
Her name is Ingrid.

38:33.851 --> 38:35.886
I didn't even know my
mother had any sisters.

38:35.920 --> 38:37.064
I'm as surprised as you are.

38:37.064 --> 38:39.022
Well, spend a little more
time in this town, love,

38:39.056 --> 38:41.358
you'll realize just about
everyone's related.

38:42.326 --> 38:46.562
This book traces the lineage
in Arendelle for generations.

38:46.597 --> 38:48.898
That's gerda, my mother.

38:48.932 --> 38:51.567
And this is Helga, my other aunt.

38:51.602 --> 38:53.569
Bloody hell.

38:53.604 --> 38:55.805
Look at this one...
she looks just like you.

38:58.311 --> 38:59.979
Maybe that's why she
was so obsessed with you,

39:00.014 --> 39:04.616
why she kept all those
relics from your childhood.

39:04.651 --> 39:06.618
She came to this world looking for blondes?

39:06.653 --> 39:08.220
There's a lot more than just me.

39:08.255 --> 39:09.655
Don't I know it.

39:09.689 --> 39:12.124
[Sighs] She wasn't looking for a blonde.

39:12.159 --> 39:13.892
She was looking for the savior.

39:13.927 --> 39:15.227
What?

39:15.262 --> 39:16.895
This scroll... the
writing is runic.

39:16.930 --> 39:18.664
It's a prophecy.

39:18.698 --> 39:22.500
It says, "the name of the savior is Emma."

39:22.535 --> 39:23.669
She knew?

39:23.703 --> 39:26.004
Before you even did. She
knew you were powerful.

39:26.039 --> 39:27.205
But why?

39:27.239 --> 39:30.141
It says it right here...

39:30.176 --> 39:33.698
"And the savior shall
become Ingrid's sister."

39:33.953 --> 39:35.921
What the hell does that mean?

39:35.955 --> 39:38.423
Well, my mother died,
and her other sister...

39:38.457 --> 39:39.824
she's not around anymore.

39:39.858 --> 39:43.728
I think Ingrid believes in this prophecy.

39:43.763 --> 39:46.431
[Door opens] I think she's
looking to replace them.

39:46.465 --> 39:48.166
[Footsteps approach] Belle: Elsa.

39:48.200 --> 39:50.735
[Sighs]

39:50.770 --> 39:52.504
Yes.

39:52.538 --> 39:54.505
I... I'm sorry.

39:54.539 --> 39:56.174
I am so, so sorry, but...

39:56.208 --> 39:57.275
What?

39:57.309 --> 40:00.945
I-I've been keeping a secret.

40:00.979 --> 40:02.927
I know your sister,
Anna. She helped me once.

40:02.927 --> 40:06.730
But when I had a chance to
help her, I let her down.

40:06.764 --> 40:09.066
And because I did,

40:09.100 --> 40:10.867
she was captured by the Snow Queen.

40:10.902 --> 40:12.081
What? Where did this happen? When?

40:12.081 --> 40:15.049
Arendelle... a long, long time ago.

40:15.084 --> 40:18.752
And I have no idea where she is now.

40:18.787 --> 40:23.224
But, uh, I'm afraid we have
a more pressing concern.

40:23.258 --> 40:27.394
The Snow Queen has a mirror
imbued with terrible magic

40:27.428 --> 40:29.697
that can do terrible things.

40:29.731 --> 40:31.532
Mirror? Easy enough,
let's just go smash it.

40:31.566 --> 40:33.233
It's not that simple.

40:33.267 --> 40:36.403
Rumple told me it's
part of an awful spell...

40:36.437 --> 40:38.939
the spell of shattered sight.

40:38.974 --> 40:40.974
If she casts it,

40:41.009 --> 40:44.311
its magic will make everyone in Storybrooke

40:44.345 --> 40:45.645
turn on one another.

40:45.679 --> 40:47.047
Bloody hell.

40:47.081 --> 40:49.116
The entire town will destroy itself.

40:49.150 --> 40:50.417
And there'd be no one left.

40:50.451 --> 40:52.119
Except us.

40:52.153 --> 40:55.122
What makes you think
that she'd spare you and Elsa?

40:55.156 --> 40:57.156
[Sighing] Because of this.

40:58.759 --> 41:01.360
She wants it to be just the three of us.

41:03.295 --> 41:05.118
Her perfect family.
