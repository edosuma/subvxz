<i>[ Phil ] Steaks Will be

00:04.010 --> 00:05.887
You're destroying those things.

00:06.012 --> 00:09.140
Ay, Jay, leave him alone. No, I'm sorry,
but that cow has suffered long enough.

00:09.223 --> 00:11.642
- Fun.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

00:11.726 --> 00:13.519
<i>Hang on. Dinner's
ready in five minutes.</i>

00:13.603 --> 00:15.521
Coach wants us
to practice layups.

00:15.605 --> 00:18.608
They are deceptively hard—
A curious mix of dance and strength.

00:18.691 --> 00:21.444
<i>- You're making it lame again.</i>
- Sorry.

00:21.527 --> 00:24.739
<i>- A</i> y, <i>Dias m/o,</i> that coach.
- Oh, I hate that guy.

00:24.822 --> 00:26.866
He seems to have
the kids motivated.

00:26.949 --> 00:30.036
Oh, Dad, you haven't seen him.
He taunts the kids. He's abusive.

00:30.119 --> 00:32.472
Listen, if this was a Colombian
soccer league, long time ago,

00:32.496 --> 00:34.892
one of the kids would have taken
that guy out and— [Cutting Sound ]

00:34.916 --> 00:37.251
<i>A coach is supposed
to ride the kids hard.</i>

00:37.335 --> 00:39.337
- Phil, help me out here.
- He's a mean man.

00:39.462 --> 00:41.881
Oh, you're such a woman.
Come to the game. You'll see.

00:41.964 --> 00:44.151
This guy's a real motherscratcher.
Pardon the language, Gloria.

00:44.175 --> 00:45.968
- Mm-hmm.
- “Gloria”?

00:46.052 --> 00:49.555
He better cool it, or I'm gonna
introduce him to the Captain and Tennille.

<i>[Mitchell 1 on, hi.</i>

00:51.182 --> 00:53.100
Sorry we're late.
I was at work.

00:53.226 --> 00:55.645
Oh, he loves to say that.
And happy barbecue.

00:55.770 --> 00:57.813
<i>Oh. [ Cameron] Since
Mitchell 119 between jobs,</i>

00:57.897 --> 01:00.483
I've taken a part-time job
at a greeting card store,

01:00.566 --> 01:02.443
which I love.

01:02.526 --> 01:05.279
Plus, with my discount,
we're saving a fortune.

01:07.323 --> 01:10.576
How is spending a ton of money on
greeting cards saving us a fortune?

01:10.660 --> 01:12.536
It's math.

01:12.662 --> 01:14.914
It's really not.
Look it up.

01:16.666 --> 01:19.126
2.95.2.95.4.95.

01:19.252 --> 01:20.628
Forty percent off.
2.95.

01:20.753 --> 01:22.356
3.95. Forty percent
off. Forty percent off.

<i>Mitchell, I got this
golf buddy of mine.</i>

01:25.174 --> 01:27.551
Great guy. Super successful.
You two should talk.

01:27.677 --> 01:30.388
It could mean a job for you.
Oh, thanks, Dad, but I'm...

01:30.513 --> 01:33.353
I'm not really looking for anything
right now. But— <i>Yeah, that's fly/71.</i>

01:33.391 --> 01:35.827
With me bringing home the bacon, Mitchell
doesn't have to rush into anything.

01:35.851 --> 01:38.521
Yeah, I know you have all that
greeting card “screw you” money,

01:38.604 --> 01:40.106
but, uh, talk to the guy?

01:40.189 --> 01:41.774
He's expecting your call
in the morning.

01:41.899 --> 01:44.443
Dad, I appreciate it, but in
the future— I can't stand this.

01:44.527 --> 01:45.736
I am sorry, but I...

01:45.820 --> 01:48.281
<i>No. Those steaks have been done
for five minutes.</i>

01:48.364 --> 01:49.865
I'm taking 'em off the grill.

01:51.659 --> 01:55.454
<i>I'm sorry. I know how it feels to have
him stick his nose where it doesn't belong.</i>

01:55.538 --> 01:57.456
No biggie.
It's just Jay being Jay.

01:57.540 --> 01:59.458
But one day I'm gonna be
a grandfather,

01:59.542 --> 02:01.544
and then everybody better
hide their meat.

Ooh. Who's she?

02:19.437 --> 02:21.355
I hate it when you do that.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.316
[ Chuckles ] Who's
he? It's Charlie Bingham.

02:23.399 --> 02:26.610
He's the guy that my dad wanted
me to call. I googled him. Look.

02:26.694 --> 02:29.530
Oh, he owns Earthgear Apparel.
I have their ski pants.

02:29.613 --> 02:31.324
Really? You don't—
You don't ski.

02:31.407 --> 02:34.368
I have cargo pants
and I don't work at the docks.

02:34.452 --> 02:38.164
God, I feel like such a slacker. I mean,
he has done so much for being so young.

02:38.289 --> 02:41.917
Okay, look. He's opened up a dozen
environmental foundations and conservancies.

02:42.043 --> 02:44.754
Wow. So, you gonna—
You gonna call him?

02:44.837 --> 02:48.799
I don't know. I mean, you know,
I sort of promised myself and you...

02:48.883 --> 02:51.093
that I'd take
a little time off, and...

02:51.218 --> 02:54.055
And you are loving
your time off. Totally.

02:55.097 --> 02:57.641
I am losing my mind.

02:57.725 --> 02:59.643
As much as I love Lin...

02:59.727 --> 03:01.979
Which is, you know,
more than life itself...

03:02.063 --> 03:05.900
I am— whoo— not cut out
to be a stay-at-home dad.

03:05.983 --> 03:09.403
No, but it's Cameron's turn. It's
Cameron's turn to be out in the world...

03:09.487 --> 03:11.965
interacting with other grown-ups
while I get to stay at home...

03:11.989 --> 03:14.784
and-and plot the death
of Dora the Explorer.

03:16.494 --> 03:20.748
Like to fill her backpack with bricks
and throw her into Candy Cane River.

03:20.831 --> 03:23.667
So, I don't know. Should I—
Should I call him?

03:23.793 --> 03:26.712
I don't know. Maybe just to get
your dad off your back. Yeah. Yeah.

03:26.796 --> 03:29.799
I mean, because the last thing I
want for you is to take a job right now.

03:29.924 --> 03:32.760
Mmm.
I am loving our life.

03:32.843 --> 03:35.221
I am in a really dark space.

03:35.304 --> 03:38.015
Being away from my Lily
is literally torture.

03:38.099 --> 03:40.059
[Weeping ]
And I can't pressure Mitchell,

03:40.142 --> 03:43.062
but I really, really, really
just want him to get a job...

03:43.145 --> 03:47.316

a stay-at-home dad/trophy wife!

Oh, I'll light him on fire!

04:04.500 --> 04:06.752
Why do I always have to
come to these things?

04:06.836 --> 04:08.921
Because you love your brother.

04:09.004 --> 04:11.090
Why don't you make him come
to my orchestra concerts?

get-together. Oh. Uh, what did you say?

04:40.035 --> 04:43.330
I said I'd check with you.
I mean, what do you think?

do you think? [ Sighs ]

04:47.001 --> 04:48.961

You're probably right. Yeah.

is a little more coaching
and a little less yelling.

to the referee. I'm coaching.

Oh, really? 'Cause I—
Phil, I coached football.

06:33.566 --> 06:36.360
Jay, I actually coached basketball.

because you can't let 'em
push you around...

06:52.543 --> 06:54.253
and you also
have to show them respect.

06:54.336 --> 06:56.255
It's like walking a tightrope.

06:56.338 --> 06:58.924
Which, by the way, I can do,
because I went to trapeze school.

06:59.008 --> 07:01.260
Did Jay? I doubt it.

buy Alex some clothes. Okeydoke.

Thank you again for taking
care of Lily. I know it's last-minute.

08:02.821 --> 08:06.033
I won't say anything else

but I've been feeling a lot
of pressure at school.

19:16.494 --> 19:18.538
You know, with friends.

19:18.621 --> 19:22.459
And I love you so much, and I
appreciate everything you do for me.

19:23.793 --> 19:26.212
I'm still your little girl.

19:28.631 --> 19:32.010
Oh, honey!
That was so sweet.

19:32.093 --> 19:35.430
Can I get $20?
A bunch of us are going to a movie,

19:35.513 --> 19:37.474
and we're gonna get something
to eat afterwards.

19:37.557 --> 19:40.226
Jenna's brother's gonna
take us home.

19:40.310 --> 19:43.980
Okay. Of course. Sweetie,
you know what? Take 40.

19:44.105 --> 19:45.982
Oh, my gosh.
Yeah. That's right.

19:46.107 --> 19:48.777
Thanks, Mom. Go
on. Have a great time.

19:51.488 --> 19:54.449
Oh, Alex, honey?
When you're out shopping,

19:54.532 --> 19:56.618
you might wanna pick
yourself up a training bra.

19:56.701 --> 20:00.163
I know you don't need one now, but
your little boobies are gonna come in soon.

20:00.246 --> 20:02.165
Mommy loves you, kitten!

20:02.248 --> 20:04.125
Mwah! Mwah!

20:04.250 --> 20:07.504
[ Engine Starts]
Teach her to screw with me.

20:12.842 --> 20:15.428
I set a pick and then rolled
towards the basket.

20:15.512 --> 20:19.099
Luke passed to me.
I shot the ball and almost made it.

20:20.809 --> 20:24.104
I bought Lily the cutest
little dress today. [Giggles]

20:24.187 --> 20:27.107
And then I stole the ball
from the other team,

20:27.190 --> 20:29.609
did a 360 and almost dunked it.

20:29.692 --> 20:34.572
That's nice. Ay. I just had
the best day today with Lin.

20:34.656 --> 20:36.616
That girl's so sweet.

20:36.699 --> 20:39.744
I have a game next Saturday.
You could come.

20:39.828 --> 20:42.747
No, it's okay. I wouldn't
want to embarrass you.

20:42.831 --> 20:46.626
I'll probably take Lily out
for cupcakes. Mm-hmm.

20:46.709 --> 20:48.378
Okay.

20:49.921 --> 20:52.257
Any suggestions?

20:52.340 --> 20:54.342
I usually go with earrings.

20:57.554 --> 20:59.013
