01:36.063 --> 01:37.498
- Ultra dry.
- Come on. Hurry up.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.433
You have a drink.
Come on.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.506
- Oh.
- Just gorgeous.

01:45.573 --> 01:46.974
Perfect.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.676
We'll be back.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.813
Hey.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.426
Been here one month,

02:38.492 --> 02:40.628
and you're all they write about.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.799
"'Who's Who and Why'.

02:45.866 --> 02:46.967
"Frivolous facts

02:47.034 --> 02:49.069
about the great
and the near-great."

02:49.136 --> 02:51.539
Ironic, being that
your book isn't out.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.875
Oh, Bunny,

02:54.942 --> 02:56.310
how I've missed you.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.745
There's been no one

02:57.811 --> 02:59.380
to keep me
tethered to the earth.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.248
So tell me, what brings
you back to New York?

03:01.249 --> 03:03.251
Did all of Europe grow
tired of your opinions,

03:03.317 --> 03:04.552
or was it just the French?

03:04.618 --> 03:06.387
Here we go. I need a drink.

03:06.454 --> 03:08.255
Have I really been gone so long

03:08.256 --> 03:09.723
that they're calling you

03:09.790 --> 03:11.325
- the son of the city now?
- Mm-hmm.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.961
Don't they realize
that you're from

03:14.027 --> 03:15.529
Minnesota?

03:15.596 --> 03:17.498
And they call this journalism.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.267
Well, working for
Vanity Fair doesn't mean

03:20.268 --> 03:22.536
you know anything about
journalism, my friend.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.312
Mm, please be a dear, darling.

03:31.379 --> 03:32.913
Of course, dear.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.516
Gives me a reason to live.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.785
I don't know why Eugenia
puts up with it.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.454
She has to. If it
weren't got Tallulah,

03:40.521 --> 03:42.523
no one would know who she is.

03:42.590 --> 03:45.192
I have to say, as unbearable
as Tallulah is,

03:45.293 --> 03:47.160
she was really lovely
in that play tonight.

03:47.295 --> 03:49.162
Lovely in a ghastly production.

03:49.297 --> 03:50.464
This town has a short mAmory.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.833
She'd better find
a new play quickly.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.909
Someone needs to dance with us.

04:01.975 --> 04:04.177
At your service.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.314
You dance with Eugenia.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.616
Thank you, sister.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.951
He must be some kind
of a genius or something.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.018
You'll enjoy that.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.759
- Shall we?
- Delighted.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.340
I have been noodling

04:33.341 --> 04:34.808
and hieing my capital eyes

04:34.875 --> 04:36.577
on this success of yours,
Fitzgerald.

04:36.644 --> 04:37.945
- I'm sure you have.
- Yes.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.980
And I have a brilliant idea.

04:40.047 --> 04:43.951
We turn Paradise
into a picture show.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.888
Starring you and Zelda.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.557
- You want us to act in it?
- Mm-hmm.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.034
- That's absurd.
- I've already spoken

04:51.058 --> 04:53.394
to my colleagues
at United Artists about it.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.795
You spoke to them
about Paradise?

04:54.862 --> 04:56.897
Yes, because I would
adapt it, obviously.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.265
Obviously.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.601
Well, who else would you
want to write it?

05:00.668 --> 05:03.003
I mean the point is
UA loves the idea.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.371
It makes sense to them.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.849
You're both already
in the public eye.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.041
- And the two of you...
- Are not actors.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.143
Exactly.
You're one better.

05:10.210 --> 05:14.415
You are Amory and Rosalind.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.184
You know, let's be honest.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.620
Those characters
are basically you.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.925
Pass the gun, darling.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.059
Mm.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.761
Leave it to Townsend

05:27.828 --> 05:30.163
to try and draft off my success.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.533
It will be a good film.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.403
Can you imagine the two of us

05:35.436 --> 05:37.905
up on the screen?

05:37.971 --> 05:39.940
I don't suppose acting's
too terribly hard.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.944
- No.
- Luddy certainly thinks
we can pull it off.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.447
Any more enbalming
fluid, old man?

05:47.548 --> 05:48.849
It's under the bed.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.584
Ah. Of course.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.054
Close the door, Bunny!

05:59.660 --> 06:01.261
I think we should do it.

06:01.328 --> 06:04.231
We have to do something
in between all these parties.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.700
I've always loved acting.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.636
And a motion picture
is something

06:08.702 --> 06:09.903
that we could do together.

06:09.970 --> 06:13.040
Think of how much fun
it'll be, goofo.

06:13.106 --> 06:17.144
Well, if it sounds
like fun to you,

06:17.210 --> 06:20.548
then it sounds like fun to me.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.452
Ohh! Can't a man
take a bath

06:24.518 --> 06:25.619
with his wife?

06:25.686 --> 06:27.120
Mr. Fitzgerald,
Mrs. Fitzgerald,

06:27.187 --> 06:29.523
people are complaining
about the noise.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.893
There is water seeping
into the room below.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.597
This is the Biltmore, sir.
We have standards.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.599
Don't make fun.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.168
I'm not. You're captivating.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.670
I mean it.

07:16.737 --> 07:20.173
As a matter of fact,

07:20.240 --> 07:21.709
I have some news.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.376
Shh!

07:23.511 --> 07:25.345
So I spoke to Townsend today.

07:25.412 --> 07:26.514
Mm-hmm.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.616
And he said before
anything can happen,

07:28.682 --> 07:30.183
the studio wants to see

07:30.250 --> 07:32.519
what we look like on celluloid.

07:32.520 --> 07:36.056
So he's arranging
for a screen test.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.858
A screen test?

07:37.925 --> 07:40.227
- Shh!
- Oh, shush yourself.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.931
You beast. Why didn't you
tell me straightaway?

07:43.997 --> 07:45.298
Isn't it enough?

07:45.365 --> 07:47.635
The two of us on film?

07:47.701 --> 07:50.203
Oh, it's like a dream.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.956
Always leave
your mouth parted.
It's more suggestive.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.100
- Her right side's better.
- Your right side's better.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.325
It is?

08:12.392 --> 08:14.828
Remember, it's all
about the close-up.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.664
Remind her not to smoke, Ed.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.165
No, don't smoke, darling.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.233
Studio rule.
It's unladylike.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.069
You just have to hold it.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.971
What's the fun of that?

08:24.037 --> 08:26.740
Well, this has nothing
to do with fun, trust me.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.108
You are smart to seek out

08:28.175 --> 08:30.243
a professional.
There's nothing worse

08:30.310 --> 08:32.245
than an amateur thespian.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.681
That's not what you do

08:33.746 --> 08:35.381
with your cigarette.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.884
Yes, it is.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.751
You don't see yourself.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.854
I do, and you always...

08:40.921 --> 08:42.722
Bitty, who's the actor here?

08:42.789 --> 08:44.057
For heaven's sake.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.862
There you go. That's better.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.064
There's really nothing
to fret over, Zelda.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.834
It's the pictures. You don't
have to actually speak.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.904
It's far less challenging
than the stage.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.006
Mama was a stage actress.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.373
Mrs. Minnie Sayre?

09:00.440 --> 09:01.675
That explains it.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.276
- Hmm.
- She was offered a part

09:03.343 --> 09:04.645
in a traveling theatrical,

09:04.712 --> 09:06.980
but her daddy thought
the profession unseemly,

09:07.047 --> 09:09.082
so she married
the judge instead.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.951
How tragic,
giving up your dreams

09:11.018 --> 09:12.720
to marry a man.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.022
Stories like that make me
especially grateful

09:15.088 --> 09:16.724
to be a lesbian.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.892
Perhaps I'm making
too big a fuss over this.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.629
I'm photographed
for the newspaper
all the time.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.330
Yes, but the question is

09:23.396 --> 09:27.500
what are you appearing
in those papers for, darling?

09:27.635 --> 09:30.237
It's not like you were
really doing anything.

09:34.742 --> 09:37.911
Oh, you're going
to be just fine.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.512
Look at you.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.281
You certainly
have the eyes for it.

09:41.348 --> 09:44.384
Yes. They're even
bigger than yours.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.653
Mm.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.662
- Zelda clips them all.
- She's making a book.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.396
Glad one of you is.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.265
These are from this week alone.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.399
They love us.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.599
I should think that you'd be

10:00.600 --> 10:00.666
I should think
that you'd be
thrilled
at the attention.

10:00.667 --> 10:01.678
thrilled at the attention.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.136
It's good for book sales.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.304
"Fitzgerald's Flounder

10:04.371 --> 10:05.773
Falls In a Fountain."

10:05.839 --> 10:07.007
Hard to see the correlation.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.341
Well, there's no such thing

10:08.408 --> 10:09.643
as bad publicity, Max,

10:09.710 --> 10:10.854
except for one's own obituary,

10:10.878 --> 10:12.179
and, well, even then.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.749
Oh, come on, Perkins.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.051
Can't a fellow
enjoy his success?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.419
I've earned this.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.721
Do you know a young author

10:20.788 --> 10:22.756
by the name of Sinclair Lewis?

10:22.823 --> 10:24.091
I never heard of him.

10:24.157 --> 10:27.227
Rumor has it his new
novel is a masterpiece.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.229
You're a real killjoy,
Perkins, you know that?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.098
I'm just trying
to protect your mantle.

10:31.164 --> 10:35.035
Well, it feels slightly
more ominous than that.

10:40.373 --> 10:41.408
See this?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.211
I was never much good at math.

10:44.277 --> 10:47.480
I can translate. This is
what we call a plateau.

10:47.547 --> 10:50.583
Sales of your book
have leveled off.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.053
One can't stay on top forever.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.288
Obviously.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.792
Unless one us a superb
writer, as you are,

10:58.859 --> 11:00.794
and one generates another book

11:00.861 --> 11:03.096
to follow on the heels
of one's first success.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.631
Have you begun writing yours?

11:04.732 --> 11:06.399
I'm always writing, Max.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.835
Mm-hmm.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.937
And what's this I hear
about a motion picture?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.339
It's one thing to sell your
stories to the pictures,

11:12.405 --> 11:13.807
but acting in them?

11:13.874 --> 11:15.876
It's just Townsend's folly.

11:15.943 --> 11:18.245
He's just angling
for an easy sell,

11:18.311 --> 11:19.546
monkeying with Zelda.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.148
It'll never come to fruition.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.249
Keep it that way.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.184
Hollywood is for writers
who can't write.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.786
It will undermine
your reputation.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.221
Worst thing you could
do for your career.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.466
I've already talked with Alfredo

12:13.533 --> 12:16.603
about making that same suit
in linen and seersucker.

12:16.669 --> 12:17.989
That way, when we
go to Hollywood,

12:18.038 --> 12:19.439
you have something
lighter to wear.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.708
I don't need any more
suits. I have plenty.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.643
How much is this costing anyway?

12:23.710 --> 12:24.912
Careful, Alfredo.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.815
Mr. Fitzgerald
dresses left.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.851
That'll be a good look
for Amory, don't you think?

12:30.918 --> 12:33.486
You'll be him, and he'll be you.

12:33.553 --> 12:36.223
There's no guarantee
that I'll be him.

12:36.289 --> 12:39.126
Of course you'll be him.
That's the whole point.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.112
Townsend's already talked
to the studio about it,

12:41.161 --> 12:43.106
- and after the screen test...
- About the screen test...

12:43.130 --> 12:45.165
I spent the whole afternoon
with Tallulah,

12:45.232 --> 12:48.168
working on my
emotional projection.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.572
Perkins doesn't like
the idea of the film.

12:52.639 --> 12:55.108
- Not one bit.
- Scott,

12:55.175 --> 12:56.844
the screen test is tomorrow,

12:56.877 --> 12:58.354
and Townsend's gone
to a lot of trouble.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.313
- I've been preparing...
- Max doesn't think

13:00.380 --> 13:02.850
that being in the pictures
befits a serious writer.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.718
He doesn't want me distracted.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.520
He just doesn't like the idea

13:07.587 --> 13:09.732
because he doesn't think he's
gonna see any money from it.

13:09.756 --> 13:10.924
That's not the issue.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.759
He's worried
that it might confuse

13:12.860 --> 13:13.994
the reading public.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.462
- That's ridiculous.
- Zelda,

13:15.528 --> 13:17.898
I need to be writing
my next novel right now,

13:17.965 --> 13:19.632
not doing screen tests.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.201
Excuse me, Alfredo.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.936
Can we just maybe pick
this up tomorrow?

13:23.003 --> 13:24.237
Stay, Alfredo.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.906
We're going to finish
this right now.

13:27.875 --> 13:31.744
- Zelda...
- This was supposed to
be our special thing.

13:31.879 --> 13:35.949
I can't be
in the pictures,
darling girl.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.886
But there's no reason you can't.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.896
- 2 cents.
- Yeah.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.798
No one's going to want
me without Scott.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.700
So we'll get someone
else to play Amory.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.768
Doug Fairbanks, Barrymore.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.370
Plenty of fellas can play it.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.241
I haven't acted
since I was a child.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.014
What do you want to do, Zelda?

14:10.650 --> 14:12.585
All right, roll film.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.387
And action.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.927
Tilt your head.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.964
Chin up.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.599
Smile.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.536
All right, cut.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.306
- Was that all right?
- Sure, sure.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.308
Listen, we're gonna
take a minute, sweetheart,

14:35.375 --> 14:38.278
and change the lens,
come in for the close-up.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.315
Should I offer
to smoke or something?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.784
- I've been practicing...
- Oh, no need.

14:44.851 --> 14:48.821
No, just...
just be yourself, Zelda.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.958
Standing here all alone, I...

14:52.092 --> 14:53.793
And these lights are so hot.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.428
I didn't realize.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.964
You look beautiful.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.370
Okay, you ready, sweetheart?

15:05.973 --> 15:07.174
All right, roll film.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.409
Action.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.481
Look to your left.

15:14.547 --> 15:15.482
Chin up.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.084
You're in Montgomery, Zelda.

15:21.521 --> 15:25.158
You're at a dance
at the country club.

15:27.194 --> 15:31.999
You bought that dress
special for that occasion.

15:33.466 --> 15:37.770
And, even if your mama
doesn't, you know

15:37.837 --> 15:40.573
the boys will love it.

15:45.478 --> 15:49.216
And the band just started
to play your favorite song.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.286
You can't wait
to show that dance card.

16:03.296 --> 16:07.434
Now the most beautiful boy
you have ever seen

16:07.500 --> 16:09.036
just walked in.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.706
And you know
you have to have him.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.319
A real
motion picture. Heavens.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.555
Well, just a screen test.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.158
They have to write
a scenario and all first,

16:31.224 --> 16:35.062
so it'll be ages from now,
but yes, that's the idea.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.497
Mama, I was so nervous.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.166
But then, all of a sudden,

16:39.232 --> 16:41.134
it all felt natural,

16:41.201 --> 16:43.703
like maybe this is meant to be.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.307
Mama, I really think
I can do this.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.742
And what does Scott
think of it all?

16:49.809 --> 16:50.809
You're his wife now,

16:50.843 --> 16:52.945
baby.
You have obligations.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.949
Well, it's his story, Mama,
so of course he's thrilled.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.486
Oh, it's so exciting, Zelda.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.155
We'll be first in line
to see it. It's...

17:02.222 --> 17:05.192
A thousand chairs
couldn't keep us away.

17:05.258 --> 17:08.895
Even Daddy?
You think he'd come?

17:08.961 --> 17:11.098
Your father loves you, baby.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.701
Mama, I miss you.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.569
Tell me what's blooming
in the garden.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.671
Oh, well,

17:18.738 --> 17:20.207
the common areolas

17:20.272 --> 17:23.175
have practically taken
over the whole backyard.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.844
Mama, I got to go.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.679
I love you.
Pick some mums.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.147
Be good, Zel...

17:38.858 --> 17:40.193
It's quite amusing.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.761
Do you really think
that I'm ready

17:41.828 --> 17:45.031
- to go to some museum?
- More like an exhibit.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.434
Ah, yeah. The Exhibit
of Fitzgerald the Young.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.902
Glass-front display,
lobby of Scribner's.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.571
Excellent. I have
just the piece.

17:51.638 --> 17:56.143
Lieutenant Fitzgerald's
military grade overseas cap.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.877
Never worn overseas.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.712
Oh. Don't forget this.

17:59.779 --> 18:03.149
A must for any
Fitzgerald collection.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.152
Oh, and I submit to you

18:05.218 --> 18:06.719
a blank page...

18:06.786 --> 18:08.255
pure, pristine.

18:08.321 --> 18:11.224
The empty promise
of his great next novel.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.693
Well, I'm glad

18:13.760 --> 18:16.163
that you're enjoying
yourself at my expense.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.465
I call it like I
see it, old man,

18:18.531 --> 18:21.601
and you, quite often,
don't want to see it.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.171
I always thought that was
the root of our friendship.

18:25.472 --> 18:26.906
Hmm.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.775
Despite all that,

18:28.841 --> 18:31.311
you have the Irish gift
of turning the language

18:31.378 --> 18:34.481
into something iridescent
and surprising.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.519
Iridescent. Huh.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.301
Guess what. Guess what.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.803
I have the most amazing news.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.506
I'm going to Hollywood.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.572
What?

19:00.607 --> 19:02.074
They want me to come
out to the Coast

19:02.209 --> 19:04.277
and audition for a new
motion picture.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.212
W-Who are they?

19:06.213 --> 19:08.215
The studio, United Artists.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.416
There's this director...

19:09.482 --> 19:10.583
- Fred Niblow.
- Yes.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.352
Fred Niblow wants to meet me.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.887
He wants me to audition
for his new picture.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.824
He thinks I have something.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.292
I can't take all the credit.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.361
Fred was in town.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.363
UA Casting Department
shared it with him.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.098
He went gangbusters
for our girl.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.634
My girl.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.802
Oh. How are we going
to celebrate?

19:29.869 --> 19:31.338
On the rocks or on the bed?

19:31.404 --> 19:33.072
I say both.
What are we drinking?

19:33.139 --> 19:34.674
First round's on me.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.270
You're stunning, darling.

20:03.336 --> 20:07.139
It just fell into your lap,
just like that.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.975
I'm excited for you.

20:10.477 --> 20:13.780
Well, United Artists did
like my... my audition.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.782
Indeed.

20:17.149 --> 20:22.121
Now you're going to be
a screen luminary.

20:22.188 --> 20:23.923
A hell of a career.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.226
What am I supposed to do?

20:27.294 --> 20:30.263
Just chase you
around the country

20:30.330 --> 20:32.732
and live off your money?

20:34.267 --> 20:35.502
Scott.

20:36.503 --> 20:40.106
To my enchanting,

20:40.172 --> 20:42.942
entrancing Zelda.

20:43.009 --> 20:47.414
No training, no experience.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.017
But instant success.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.363
Want something to write about?

21:03.430 --> 21:04.897
Here we go, gentlemen.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.466
Mr. Scott Fitzgerald.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.475
Whoo!

21:17.744 --> 21:18.744
Ha!

21:25.084 --> 21:26.486
Come on. Ah!

21:26.553 --> 21:28.688
I've got a name for you.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.356
New name.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.258
Sinclair Lewis.

21:32.359 --> 21:36.496
S-I-N-C...

21:36.563 --> 21:39.532
S-I-N-C-lair Lewis.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.143
Fitzgerald, people
came to see the girls...

21:41.167 --> 21:42.411
- Sinclair...
- ...not you. Let's go.

21:42.435 --> 21:43.579
- Get your hands off me.
- Let's go.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.638
Get...

21:45.705 --> 21:48.908
Get your predatory
hands off my wife.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.445
And my novel.

22:09.128 --> 22:10.497
Zelda?

22:23.976 --> 22:25.612
I need to find my coat.

22:27.279 --> 22:29.015
I got to find my wife.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.081
Sir?

22:30.116 --> 22:31.751
Sir.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.504
- There you are.
- Hmm?

22:53.773 --> 22:55.742
I just needed some fresh air.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.044
Give me a cigarette.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.486
That man in there?

23:07.454 --> 23:09.456
I don't know who that is.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.724
Hey, Zelda,

23:11.791 --> 23:13.660
I fear we may have ridden him

23:13.726 --> 23:15.261
a little hard tonight.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.163
It seems we hit a nerve.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.366
He never took any of this
movie talk seriously.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.635
Townsend's the one
who thought I could act.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.704
Townsend's the one who
tried to make it happen.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.939
Townsend had his own
interests at heart.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.010
Does he think I can't
do it without him?

23:31.077 --> 23:32.979
I think it's more
the case he doesn't think

23:33.045 --> 23:36.983
he can do what he does
without you.

23:37.049 --> 23:40.553
He's scared, Zelda.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.354
You're the only one
who keeps him

23:42.489 --> 23:44.223
from spinning out of control.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.493
He'd be lost without you.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.995
That's not fair.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.198
Isn't that what you
signed up for?

24:30.302 --> 24:31.571
Scott.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.650
I'm sorry.

24:46.418 --> 24:48.688
I messed everything up.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.821
♫ Yes, sir, that's my baby ♫

25:21.888 --> 25:23.856
