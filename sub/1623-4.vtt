00:01.043 --> 00:02.408
Previously on 12 Monkeys...

00:02.544 --> 00:05.832
Four years from now, most of the human
race is gonna be wiped out by a plague.

00:05.964 --> 00:10.207
Many became scavengers, raiding
whatever they could get their hands on.

00:10.344 --> 00:13.086
Leland Goines had a secret lab.
His daughter knows where it is.

00:13.222 --> 00:14.337
They want what's inside.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.259
Tell me the location of the Night Room.

00:16.391 --> 00:19.519
Their specialized equipment.
You find it, you find the Night Room.

00:19.645 --> 00:21.886
RAMSE: If he finds out
about the facility,

00:22.022 --> 00:23.523
the West 7 will pick us clean.

00:23.649 --> 00:24.980
It's gonna be a problem.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.770
MAX: I found shelter
and you won 't believe what else.

00:27.903 --> 00:29.234
I found Cole.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.342
So what am I looking at here?

00:54.471 --> 00:56.427
Possible sites of the Night Room,

00:56.557 --> 00:59.139
arranged in varying degrees
of probability.

00:59.268 --> 01:02.852
I had to cross-reference suppliers
with shipping data,

01:02.980 --> 01:04.891
decipher a lot of technical jargon.

01:05.023 --> 01:09.767
- You got all this from the CDC?
- Yeah, and some cold calls.

01:09.903 --> 01:13.020
My bullshitting skills
are getting a workout.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.066
There's still too many possible sites.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.659
And the 12 Monkeys already have
Jennifer Goines.

01:19.788 --> 01:23.372
They have to break through a lot of
crazy before she leads them anywhere.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.742
- And if they find it first?
- We stop 'em.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.629
- Kill them?
- If that's what it takes, yeah.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.837
- Look, Cassie, these guys...
- Are worth seven billion.

01:38.807 --> 01:42.516
I know how it works now.
The math is easy.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.054
Never said it was easy.

01:45.981 --> 01:51.521
Look, if you knew what it was like back
there, what I've seen, you'd understand.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.688
Then tell me.

01:54.281 --> 01:57.148
You know all about me, where I'm from.

01:58.702 --> 02:02.945
You know where I'm going to die.
I don't know anything about you.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.946
What is there to know?

02:05.959 --> 02:09.247
Well... Well, let's start
with where you're from.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.174
If we stay focused on the mission,
none of that's gonna matter.

02:23.769 --> 02:25.885
Look, there's nothing to tell.

02:26.021 --> 02:29.764
I don't know what it is about you
that you don't want me to know.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.857
Cass.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.378
It's gotta be here somewhere.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.922
If this is a bust,
we head out at first light.

03:00.806 --> 03:04.515
Might be too hungry to move anywhere,
man. We're down to scraps.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.730
(CLATTERING)

03:23.453 --> 03:25.569
Ramse.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.199
Take the shot.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.417
I'm taking it. I'm taking it, man.
Relax.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.457
(WHINES)

03:34.589 --> 03:37.171
- Come on, take the shot.
- Why don't you take the shot?

03:37.300 --> 03:39.916
You saw it, you kill it.
That's the rules.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.090
Since when has that been a rule, man?
That was never a rule.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.431
- (DOG WHINES)
- l'm starving.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.062
We're gonna die. You know that?

03:58.822 --> 04:01.939
We'll find something. Always do.

04:02.075 --> 04:06.284
- No. We're in Atari.
- Atari? What's that?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.779
It's a game called Go.

04:08.915 --> 04:12.032
Game I used to play
when l was a little kid.

04:12.169 --> 04:15.286
It means you're out of moves.

04:15.422 --> 04:19.631
Got one move left,
whether you like it or not.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.752
- So Atari's bad?
- Mm-hm.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.841
Stay out of Atari, brother.

04:29.227 --> 04:31.969
(WHIRRING)

04:32.105 --> 04:33.515
(BARKS)

04:50.874 --> 04:52.614
What's going on? Why am | back here?

04:52.751 --> 04:56.710
We brought you back.
This shot'll help with the pain.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.792
Careful. Here, let me orient you.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.385
I am Thomas Lasky. Your name is Cole.

05:05.514 --> 05:08.551
It is 2043,
the afternoon on a Wednesday.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.345
All right.
All right, it's Wednesday. I got it.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.843
(COUGHS)

05:14.397 --> 05:16.649
- What's going on?
- RAMSE: We got a problem.

05:16.775 --> 05:19.892
Took down two scavs
on the perimeter this morning.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.360
They're marked like this.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.822
West 7. That didn't take long.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.243
Max lied. She's still with them.

05:30.372 --> 05:33.956
lf Deacon's onto this place,
it's a mother lode.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.959
- Welcome back, Mr Cole.
- We're tracking the Night Room.

05:38.088 --> 05:41.171
- Cassie's getting close.
- WHITLEY: You should still be there.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.336
But Mr Ramse believes
we are under imminent threat of attack.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.211
- By scavengers.
- We don't know how many are out there.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.054
They're gonna hit us hard, though.

05:50.183 --> 05:54.051
lt's irrelevant. With our defenses,
we can take a few dozen scavs.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.304
No, they're West 7.
This is our old crew, OK?

05:57.440 --> 06:02.810
- Now, Deacon, the guy that runs them...
- Got it. The scav king. Very scary.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.904
He's got twice our number.
Don't underestimate him.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.569
Take Mr Cole and Mr Ramse
with you up top.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.242
I don't need them.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.492
They have experience with these people.
You don't.

06:23.550 --> 06:27.338
If this facility were to fall,
all would be lost.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.131
The mission's everything.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.400
How's Cassie?

06:45.071 --> 06:48.780
Right before I splintered, she was
asking me all kinds of questions,

06:48.909 --> 06:53.403
where I was born, what my life's
like back here, that kind of thing.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.996
- What did you tell her?
- What is there to tell?

06:57.125 --> 06:59.867
Come on. Are you gonna tell her
about your best friend?

07:00.003 --> 07:02.210
Guy who devours blondes for dinner?

07:03.673 --> 07:05.789
Elena wasn't blonde.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.341
Elena was a whole different thing, man.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.262
I know.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.674
I think you'd like Cassie, though.

07:15.810 --> 07:20.224
She reminds me of you, always
waving her moral compass around.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.565
- She waving yours?
- (CHUCKLES)

07:23.693 --> 07:25.900
No. Thanks for asking.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.566
MAN OVER RADIO: Copy that.

07:28.698 --> 07:32.361
Perimeter guards spotted a vehicle
headed this way, couple of miles out.

07:32.494 --> 07:35.361
- Said it was packing some armor.
- Sounds like them.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.364
- Secure the doors.
- Got your boogie shoes on?

07:38.500 --> 07:42.539
- Size 11s.
- Let's bring back some memories.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.946
Hey.

08:11.074 --> 08:14.566
Hey, Ramse, put it down. Put it down.
Put it down. Come on.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.819
I would listen to your friend, son.

08:32.387 --> 08:34.469
These are two of my meanest.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.932
- Do you know who we are?
- West 7.

08:39.060 --> 08:43.224
You slaughtered everybody
at the Western 7 quarantine zone.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.644
Doctors, soldiers. You killed kids.

08:47.736 --> 08:51.069
- Quarantine?
- (LAUGHTER)

08:51.197 --> 08:55.281
Please. Do you wanna live
the rest of your life behind plastic?

08:55.410 --> 08:59.744
Hell, those survivors
never stood a chance, son.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.785
Their DNA sealed their fate years ago.

09:02.917 --> 09:07.411
The world belongs to the immune, to us.

09:08.715 --> 09:14.255
200 strong and not one starving.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.513
You look tired.

09:20.226 --> 09:24.060
Tired of running, tired of looking
over your shoulder. Am I right?

09:26.232 --> 09:28.314
Hm?

09:29.652 --> 09:32.439
And it appears
we have a couple of openings.

09:34.741 --> 09:38.359
You're real survivors.
You made it this far. That is good.

09:38.495 --> 09:44.616
Don't you want a warm place
to sleep tonight? Full bellies?

09:46.377 --> 09:48.288
It sure as hell beats the alternative.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.425
I don't think so.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.466
We're listening. We're listening.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.846
My name's Cole. This is Ramse.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.436
I am Deacon.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.572
Light 'em up. 12 o'clock.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.325
MAN: Got more over here!

10:26.960 --> 10:28.791
To the right!

10:36.719 --> 10:38.505
(MAN SHOUTS)

10:39.514 --> 10:41.300
Target hit!

10:46.813 --> 10:49.145
(SHOUTING)

11:09.836 --> 11:12.077
Cole! Cover me!

11:19.846 --> 11:21.302
Hey.

11:29.272 --> 11:32.389
Whitley, we're clear down here.
What have you got?

11:32.525 --> 11:35.608
WHITLEY: Nothing up top.
That wasn't much of an assault.

11:35.737 --> 11:38.729
This ain't it, man. It was a diversion.

11:38.865 --> 11:42.073
- Yeah, Deacon's putting on a show.
- They found another way in.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.570
Whitley, you got men stationed
at the exhaust tunnels?

11:46.706 --> 11:50.164
[put a two-man team on it, but no way
they can know about those tunnels.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.249
Don't be so sure.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.628
WOMAN: Cole!

11:59.802 --> 12:03.761
They're inside! Scavs are coming
through the tunnels! I 'm headed down.

12:03.890 --> 12:07.474
Spread out.
Find the choke points, the usual.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.057
We are moving in.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.271
And I don't feel like sharing.

12:26.663 --> 12:30.656
Food, water, booze, women.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.962
Hell of a lot better
than you're used to.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.080
This is you.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.086
Why the tents?

12:41.219 --> 12:44.336
We are expanding, growing in numbers,
gathering supplies.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.508
Raiding survivors.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.883
Did you boys find a way to survive
without doing the same?

12:50.019 --> 12:52.806
We've been on our own for a long time.
He'll be OK.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.021
DEACON: Max.

12:57.235 --> 13:01.274
Max, this is Cole.
l have high hopes for Cole.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.863
Cole could use a new friend,
couldn't you, Cole?

13:03.992 --> 13:07.155
So be his friend and show him around.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.996
- She doesn't have to. It's OK.
- Why? You got something better to do?

13:11.124 --> 13:14.867
I'll go slow. You just try and keep up.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.244
Welcome home, Cole.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.926
- How'd they find out about the tunnels?
- No idea.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.097
MAN: Got two on your right!

13:38.234 --> 13:41.021
Easy. lt's us.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.021
- MAN: Blue Team, to the right tunnel!
- How many inside?

13:44.157 --> 13:47.149
- No idea.
- They knew about the exhaust tunnels.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.241
- Any of your guys go missing?
- No.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.157
We have to secure the machine.
Nothing else matters now.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.076
Not just the machine.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.245
They see these lights, they know
we got a hell of a power source.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.960
Ramse stays with me.
We'll secure the core.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.876
- Take Jones to the machine.
- We'll seal it off, keep 'em out.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.671
- Eyes open.
- Always.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.543
Come on.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.392
Cole?

14:17.106 --> 14:18.642
Go!

14:27.700 --> 14:30.783
Where the hell have you been?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.569
Open this door.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.786
- COLE: Ramse, you at the core yet?
- I'm here.

14:38.961 --> 14:43.125
We 're sealed in the splinter chamber.
Deacon's right outside the door.

14:53.893 --> 14:58.808
Sorry, buddy.
You're on your own from here on out.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.556
- What are you talking about?
- I'm in Atari.

15:01.692 --> 15:02.818
What?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.316
(GUNFIRE)

15:10.910 --> 15:12.411
Ramse?

15:13.871 --> 15:14.906
Ramse?

15:28.261 --> 15:30.673
- Get out of my way.
- Is that really what you want?

15:30.805 --> 15:32.841
- Move!
- You'll never make it!

15:32.974 --> 15:36.387
You'll kill one, maybe two,
and you'll be dead.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.386
And Ramse will have died for nothing.

15:44.944 --> 15:48.562
I can send you back.
We still have power.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.697
Back to Dr Railly for good.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.450
You will not have my support,
but you'll have hers.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.784
Come on.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.870
You're out of time. Come on.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.594
I'm sending you as close as I can
to when you left Dr Railly.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.936
Most likely
we'll never see each other again.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.154
Goodbye, Mr Cole.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.612
lt's James.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.987
Katarina.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.062
MAN: Run, you bastards!

17:10.655 --> 17:12.737
We're right behind you!

17:14.659 --> 17:16.320
I'm sick of this, man.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.444
I'm sick of hearing you whine about it.
We got a job to do.

17:19.580 --> 17:23.038
Robbing sad sacks for dog food?

17:24.877 --> 17:26.868
We're part of a tribe now, brother.

17:27.004 --> 17:29.165
That's what this is? A tribe?

17:29.298 --> 17:32.586
- Best we ever had it.
- You're serious?

17:36.847 --> 17:39.930
Are you ladies ready? Let's do this.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.263
Go. Hey.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.435
Go. Go!

17:54.323 --> 17:55.859
(CLICKS)

18:05.126 --> 18:06.866
Stop!

18:09.422 --> 18:10.912
It's over.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.593
We already took their shit.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.673
Let's move on.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.046
Careful, Ramse.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.891
We got everything we need.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.559
Let them live, create an enemy.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.900
They're weak. They got nothing.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.822
We're not creating anything.

18:39.493 --> 18:42.200
Yes, we are.

18:44.540 --> 18:47.202
And it's ours, not theirs.

18:49.629 --> 18:54.168
Shame about the meek.
They don't inherit shit.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.803
Cole!

19:33.047 --> 19:35.413
- Ah!
- I said stay still.

19:35.549 --> 19:39.417
- I'm trying to.
- Yeah? Try harder.

19:39.553 --> 19:40.963
Ah!

19:41.097 --> 19:43.179
What a baby.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.678
Oh, what would you do without me, huh?

19:49.021 --> 19:51.103
I don't know. I don't know.

19:51.232 --> 19:53.814
I don't know.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.059
Are you OK?

19:56.195 --> 19:59.904
Yeah, yeah.
I don't think it cut too deep.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.068
I'm not talking about that.

20:04.161 --> 20:11.203
You know, I've been with the 7
for a long time, since I was 13.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.751
A lot of days like today,

20:13.879 --> 20:19.419
and that sort of thing,
it can get to you after a while.

20:21.387 --> 20:25.096
- 13, huh?
- Mm.

20:25.224 --> 20:30.139
- Isn't that when your dad...
- Yeah, when he was killed.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.270
By scavs.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.104
Why'd you join up? You never told me.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.610
Because I had no choice.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.071
- Ah!
- There. You're all done.

20:51.709 --> 20:56.203
So what if you did have a choice,
then, huh? Where would you be?

20:57.131 --> 20:59.213
That depends.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.625
Where are you?

21:24.366 --> 21:28.109
- Jeez.
- Yeah. Sorry.

21:30.915 --> 21:33.076
- See you later.
- See you later.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.204
This couldn't wait?

21:37.213 --> 21:39.499
Do you know why I'm here?

21:44.303 --> 21:46.669
Look...

21:46.806 --> 21:49.013
(SIGHS)

21:49.141 --> 21:52.679
Ramse's got his own way
of looking at things.

21:52.812 --> 21:56.225
I'm sure he wasn't trying
to challenge your authority or...

22:04.031 --> 22:06.113
Do you like it here?

22:11.288 --> 22:12.949
What do you want me to do?

22:13.082 --> 22:17.576
See, that's what I like about you, Cole.
I don't have to sugarcoat things.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.504
You are welcome here.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.460
But Ramse has to go.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.389
You let 'em live, create an enemy.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.816
Now, I could do it.

22:41.068 --> 22:44.686
But it would be worse.

22:44.822 --> 22:49.191
I would have to... I'd have to
make an example out of him...

22:51.203 --> 22:53.285
...take my time.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.740
I understand.

23:03.048 --> 23:08.384
Men like us understand
what the world is now...

23:10.598 --> 23:14.341
...what it takes to survive.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.562
And there ain't a lot of us left.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.606
But at least you're not alone any more.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.910
By sun-up.

23:45.966 --> 23:48.628
(GROANS)

23:59.855 --> 24:01.937
Oh, no.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.857
No, no, no, no.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.195
Hey.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.493
I thought that was you.

24:20.626 --> 24:23.288
What did you do? You killed him!

24:25.339 --> 24:28.957
- What are you talking about?
- What about Jones, the woman?

24:29.093 --> 24:31.960
- You kill her too?
- Cole, you're not making any sense.

24:32.096 --> 24:35.304
You led them right to us.
Ramse trusted you.

24:42.106 --> 24:44.563
Holy shit.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.694
Salutations, my friend Cole.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.854
Look at you.
Years haven't changed you a bit.

24:53.534 --> 24:56.196
Wait a minute. Wait... Wait a minute.

24:59.748 --> 25:02.535
Damn. How hard did you hit him?

25:04.128 --> 25:06.210
It's Monday.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.124
DEACON: It's good to know the day.

25:08.257 --> 25:11.795
It's the first day
of the rest of your life.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.634
So don't worry.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.679
It won't be long.

25:44.918 --> 25:48.376
I don't know how much more shit
I can take from that guy.

25:50.966 --> 25:55.426
Trust me... he feels the same.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.560
You talked to him already?

26:07.399 --> 26:09.685
Yeah, I talked to him.

26:20.204 --> 26:24.072
Here... take it.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.325
Hey.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.088
OK.

26:33.217 --> 26:37.711
It's what you came here to do. I don't
even know why we're wasting time.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.094
I don't even know who you are, man.

26:43.227 --> 26:44.888
I'm a survivor,

26:45.020 --> 26:48.933
and I'm doing it a hell of a lot better
than you or I ever did on our own.

26:50.150 --> 26:53.893
OK, you don't get it, man.
Deacon understands what the world is.

26:54.029 --> 26:57.317
- Deacon? Deacon's a cult.
- (LAUGHS)

26:57.449 --> 27:00.316
His followers...
His followers are murderers.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.828
You got a short memory, man.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.411
- You and I did plenty before the 7.
- When we had to.

27:04.540 --> 27:07.623
- It's the same thing.
- When we had to!

27:12.047 --> 27:16.040
Deacon's taking for power, OK?

27:16.176 --> 27:19.043
He's murdering cos he likes it.

27:20.472 --> 27:26.468
Whatever this world is now,
it shouldn't be this, man.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.478
It shouldn't be this.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.727
What are you waiting for?

28:06.810 --> 28:08.892
Man, I gotta get out of here tonight.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.934
We go together, man.

28:16.236 --> 28:20.650
Deacon's gonna try to hunt us down.
We should take care of him first.

28:20.782 --> 28:24.650
You wanna take on the whole crew?
That's suicide, man.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.167
(GRUNTS)

29:16.546 --> 29:18.958
- How you doing?
- (COUGHS)

29:19.091 --> 29:23.175
It's Tuesday, by the way. I know
you're having trouble keeping track.

29:25.681 --> 29:29.640
This girl has some unresolved issues
where you're concerned.

29:38.944 --> 29:43.187
You...
You have been living the good life.

29:43.323 --> 29:48.989
Clean water, lights,
chocolates on your pillow.

29:49.121 --> 29:52.613
Got your own little piece
of civilization.

29:57.546 --> 30:01.334
So why don't you tell us
how to get in the compound?

30:03.885 --> 30:05.967
Oh.

30:15.647 --> 30:19.560
Now, beating on you, that's really...
that's really just for me.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.897
It's very therapeutic.

30:23.030 --> 30:26.648
But I am a busy man, so...

30:34.833 --> 30:39.497
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

30:40.589 --> 30:43.422
Oh, I know.

30:48.472 --> 30:51.805
You know, this...
this we picked up from the daughters.

30:52.893 --> 30:53.928
Oh, wow.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.682
This stuff will get you talking.

31:04.613 --> 31:08.731
And after, you are gonna beg me
to beat you again.

31:10.327 --> 31:12.409
Have a nice trip, Cole.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.662
So long, Cole.

31:18.502 --> 31:21.744
Just keep him alive.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.962
I'm not through with him yet.

31:27.344 --> 31:30.131
Max. Max.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.720
Max, you have to help me.

31:32.849 --> 31:36.967
Or I need to just leave
without another word.

31:38.939 --> 31:41.521
You'd understand that, right?

31:41.650 --> 31:44.858
- Yeah.
- Deacon's just gonna wear you down.

31:44.986 --> 31:48.274
Tell him how to get into that place
so he'll kill you faster.

31:48.407 --> 31:54.403
No, no, I can't. I can't do that.
No, they're... they're gonna kill Ramse.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.494
There's nothing you can do.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.242
- You can't change fate.
- I need to save him.

32:01.378 --> 32:04.541
Not theirs, not Ramse's.
The future's set.

32:04.673 --> 32:07.506
- RAMSE: I'm in Atari.
- JONES: Ramse died for nothing.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.625
- The future's set.
- I need to save him.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.752
MAX:
Tell him how to get into that place.

32:11.888 --> 32:14.300
COLE: They're...
They're gonna kill Ramse.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.549
JONES: Ramse died for nothing.
Save him.

32:16.685 --> 32:18.141
(SCREAMS)

32:20.188 --> 32:23.521
I
No. Max! I'm sorry!

32:23.650 --> 32:27.313
I'm sorry, Max. Please.
Please, I'm sorry. Please help me.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.528
Please, Max! Please help me.

32:31.074 --> 32:35.317
Even if I wanted to help you, Cole,
how... how can I possibly do that?

32:36.121 --> 32:40.034
- Tell me.
- You can help me. You can help me.

32:40.167 --> 32:42.328
There's another entrance
to the compound.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.747
- Where?
- On the south side of the building.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.620
- It's a tunnel system.
- OK.

32:46.756 --> 32:49.589
Overgrown. You have to go there.
You have to warn them.

32:49.718 --> 32:53.381
Ask to speak to Ramse.
He'll believe you. He'll believe you.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.596
DEACON: See?

33:00.729 --> 33:03.061
Was that so hard?

33:05.358 --> 33:08.020
- Tell the men to get ready.
- You got it.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.735
DEACON: We're moving out before dawn.

33:35.096 --> 33:37.178
(CHUCKLES)

33:39.226 --> 33:42.434
- Where's Deacon?
- Just rolled out with the rest of them.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.392
Now, he said he wanted you alive.

33:47.651 --> 33:53.362
But, you know, he didn't say
that you had to be all shiny and new.

33:54.741 --> 33:58.609
So... Oh, this is gonna be good.

34:04.292 --> 34:05.828
You stupid bitch.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.210
What are you doing?

34:13.843 --> 34:15.925
I don't know.

34:18.557 --> 34:23.472
You know,
maybe ljust wanna kill you myself.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.015
You gonna?

34:34.906 --> 34:38.444
Maybe. Cos I am West 7.

34:38.577 --> 34:44.072
No, you're not. You never were.
Get me out of here. There's still time.

34:44.207 --> 34:46.914
No. See, I don't owe you a damn thing.

34:49.546 --> 34:52.128
No, you don't. I left you here.

34:54.092 --> 34:57.801
But if I'd taken you with me,
I would've made you a target.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.466
I never expected us
to make it as far as we did.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.215
Deacon wanted Ramse dead.

35:04.436 --> 35:09.305
He wanted me to do it,
put a bullet in my brother.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.357
- Oh, but you didn't.
- No.

35:18.742 --> 35:21.654
But I walked up to him, gun in hand,
so what does that make me?

35:23.496 --> 35:27.239
Max, it doesn't have to be like this.

35:28.168 --> 35:30.250
Help me take Deacon down.

35:32.714 --> 35:34.921
(GROANS)

35:41.222 --> 35:44.680
- Where's the facility?
- This way. We're gonna have to run.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.523
(GUNFIRE)

36:04.120 --> 36:06.372
Truck's a distraction.
We still have time.

36:06.498 --> 36:09.160
- How do you know?
- I know.

36:09.292 --> 36:13.285
RAMSE: This ain't it.
This was a diversion.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.208
- Deacon's putting on a show.
- They found another way in.

36:16.341 --> 36:19.299
Whitley, you got men stationed
at the exhaust tunnels?

36:19.427 --> 36:22.794
- Hey, you OK?
- That wasn't much of an assault.

36:22.931 --> 36:25.638
Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK.

36:29.688 --> 36:32.054
Cole!

36:42.992 --> 36:44.778
Breaching the tunnels.

36:46.037 --> 36:49.404
You go that way, we don't make it
in time, trust me. This way.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.710
Deacon's making his way to the machine.

36:56.840 --> 36:59.001
- What?
- Go down this hallway.

36:59.134 --> 37:02.501
There's gonna be a door there.
Deacon will be trying to get inside.

37:02.637 --> 37:06.846
There's a woman inside, a scientist.
You need to save her.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.556
- Where are you going?
- Trust me!

37:08.685 --> 37:10.391
Cole!

37:16.693 --> 37:19.651
Where the hell have you been?

37:20.572 --> 37:22.858
Open this door.

37:22.991 --> 37:26.779
COLE: We 're sealed in the splinter
chamber. Deacon's right outside.

37:26.911 --> 37:31.154
Sorry, buddy.
You're on your own from here on out.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.122
I'm in Atari.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.038
(GUNFIRE)

37:49.976 --> 37:52.683
Ramse! You all right?

37:52.812 --> 37:54.973
- Yeah, I'm good.
- All right, man.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.181
COLE OVER RADIO: Ramse?

38:00.153 --> 38:02.235
Ramse?

38:04.115 --> 38:05.651
Ramse!

38:05.784 --> 38:07.991
- What is this?
- I'll explain it to you later.

38:08.119 --> 38:12.613
Look, if we don't move right now,
Jones is gonna die. Come on. Come on.

38:47.909 --> 38:49.649
- Get up!
- Come on, get up.

38:49.786 --> 38:51.242
Let's go. Let's go.

39:04.384 --> 39:06.921
Let's go!

39:14.561 --> 39:19.396
WHITLEY: West 7 are retreating. Deacon's
men bailed out the sector-five exit.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.900
COLE: Any word on Deacon?

39:29.325 --> 39:32.988
Another sweep came back. No sign of him.

39:33.121 --> 39:37.114
And if he's smart, he's miles away.
His camp's with him.

39:38.293 --> 39:41.956
But I'm sure he's gonna take another
shot. He knows what's down there.

39:44.924 --> 39:48.792
I should have let you kill him
the night we left.

39:49.387 --> 39:52.094
- What's done is done.
- Not any more.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.886
We got that machine.

39:56.019 --> 39:58.010
We do it right this time.

39:58.146 --> 39:59.977
No.

40:00.106 --> 40:03.769
Jones says the only reason that happened
was the damage to the machine.

40:03.902 --> 40:07.645
Shortjump like that, she couldn't
do it again if she wanted to.

40:09.741 --> 40:13.905
Who knows? Maybe things happen
the way they do for a reason.

40:14.954 --> 40:19.243
If that's true, then why undo it at all?

40:29.260 --> 40:33.549
- Jones letting Max stay?
- Yeah. We owe her.

40:33.681 --> 40:36.423
If it wasn't for her,
Deacon'd be king of the castle.

40:37.769 --> 40:40.181
You guys gonna pick up
where you left off?

40:40.313 --> 40:44.147
No. No, it's not like that.

40:44.901 --> 40:47.142
Right, right.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.564
Cassie.

40:49.697 --> 40:52.689
- Yeah.
- Listen, you need help.

40:53.493 --> 40:55.324
I want you to talk to her.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.786
And I want you to bring up your friend.

40:58.915 --> 41:00.906
The one who eats blondes for breakfast?

41:01.042 --> 41:03.124
Yes, him.

41:05.838 --> 41:09.376
Seriously... take a shot.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.293
Worth the risk.

41:24.524 --> 41:26.310
(KNOCKING)

41:34.283 --> 41:35.898
- Cassie.
- Where have you been?

41:36.035 --> 41:39.402
I mean, I know where... when.

41:39.539 --> 41:42.076
- What took you so long?
- It's a long story.

41:42.208 --> 41:46.542
OK, well, listen,
I have been all over this.

41:46.671 --> 41:50.038
It took me longer than I would have
liked because I did it by myself.

41:50.174 --> 41:54.964
I know. I know.
I keep doing this, coming and going.

41:56.431 --> 41:58.922
Look, what you said before I left,
you're right.

41:59.058 --> 42:01.344
You don't know anything about me.

42:01.477 --> 42:05.516
I've never really been...
very good at talking.

42:08.693 --> 42:09.773
Cole...

42:09.902 --> 42:12.393
So if you wanna know about me,
I'll tell you.

42:13.698 --> 42:18.112
A little town just outside Philadelphia,
it's not that far away from here,

42:18.244 --> 42:20.326
that's where I was born.

42:21.998 --> 42:26.492
Cole... lfound it.

42:28.421 --> 42:29.456
I found it.

42:32.091 --> 42:34.173
I found the Night Room.
