The tray teeth.

26:59.620 --> 27:02.789
It estn announcing want
we know that they are here.

27:03.457 --> 27:04.458
Who

27:05.834 --> 27:07.127
Revelation 6:

27:08.003 --> 27:09.796
Bean and I watched a white horse;
and that tena him a bow ...

27:11.965 --> 27:15.636
was given a crown and left as the winner.

27:16.136 --> 27:20.599
When I opened the second seal
or second living deca: <<Ven>>

27:20.766 --> 27:25.896
Then went out another horse red;
which was granted him ...

27:26.021 --> 27:29.650
Remove the earth peace
and was given a large sword.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.194
• You remember that

27:35.364 --> 27:39.117
When he opened the third seal
or third-living deca: <<Come>>

27:39.201 --> 27:41.078
I looked and then a horse black beans

27:41.245 --> 27:44.748
him that the tena
a balance in hand.

27:46.250 --> 27:47.584
The estn ticking.

27:48.210 --> 27:50.128
The quarter horse is the PLID.

27:50.838 --> 27:55.342
The name that sat on him was Death
Hades and you.

27:57.845 --> 28:00.430
They are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

28:16.363 --> 28:20.784
The book of Revelation is the vision
Apstol of John.

28:21.243 --> 28:24.913
Gives a vision of the final
seg n reveals Jes s.

28:25.497 --> 28:31.670
The riders of the first four
seven prophets of doom.

28:33.630 --> 28:37.217
Well la Muerte
PLID horse goes.

28:38.177 --> 28:41.555
- That in fact is green.
- Pestilence in the black horse.

28:41.763 --> 28:44.099
- And the red horse is ...
- War.

28:44.391 --> 28:47.603
What is the difference between death
and the War

28:48.312 --> 28:52.649
I believe that war is a good
no concept of the men ...

28:52.816 --> 28:54.902
killing one of them but of conflicts.

28:55.277 --> 28:58.489
Death is something physical and
War a state minimum.

28:59.323 --> 29:01.325
And the rider of the white horse

29:01.408 --> 29:05.370
The white horse rider is lder.

29:06.038 --> 29:12.127
Some believe it is the Antichrist
others believe that Jesus Christ is the same.

29:17.591 --> 29:23.388
Aidan these people chose to
riders as models for a reason.

29:23.847 --> 29:29.770
If you really understand the symbolism
of riders and apparently is as ...

29:30.187 --> 29:33.482
should expect that things
pondrn is much worse.

29:34.399 --> 29:36.485
We are looking for a
team of four people.

29:36.735 --> 29:39.071
They have the intention to charge
two more victims.

29:39.321 --> 29:40.656
My intention is to stop them.

29:40.906 --> 29:44.827
The first suspect is the smaller
weighs between 100 and 115 pounds.

29:45.244 --> 29:49.498
The other three while he watched
Marianne tortured Spitz.

29:49.832 --> 29:53.210
The suspects were arrested
much time around his head.

29:53.335 --> 29:55.212
Must have been having
conversacin tremendous.

29:55.838 --> 30:00.300
The second suspect is Garrison Jacobs
whose whereabouts are unknown.

30:00.801 --> 30:04.388
The third suspect deals
the death blow for both.

30:05.180 --> 30:07.558
I think the horse PLID.

30:08.267 --> 30:10.102
- Death.
- Why

30:10.644 --> 30:17.442
Because the fourth suspect is nico
that on both occasions did not move.

30:17.442 --> 30:19.236
Not even an inch.

30:20.028 --> 30:24.783
The fourth suspect is that the
have to worry about.

30:24.825 --> 30:25.826
Is the group lder.

30:27.202 --> 30:28.912
If you're ending it.

30:45.721 --> 30:46.889
Breslin.

30:46.972 --> 30:49.308
Bres another body at the Bell Hotel.

31:05.866 --> 31:07.534
What got to me

31:37.105 --> 31:38.941
Hello Garrison.

31:39.983 --> 31:41.109
Bres.

31:42.945 --> 31:46.198
You remember when you spoke of
pu winged and the ...

31:46.406 --> 31:49.034
it was intentional
- S said it was impossible.

31:50.035 --> 31:51.370
Retreat this.

31:53.080 --> 31:56.458
- Is the same
- Almost exactly.

31:56.792 --> 31:58.710
It means we are looking for someone
with medical knowledge.

31:58.877 --> 32:01.338
Or a penchant for medicine.

32:01.672 --> 32:03.048
Same thing.

32:05.092 --> 32:06.885
There is no rigging.

32:15.435 --> 32:17.604
Arrived on Monday afternoon
with a single suitcase.

32:18.564 --> 32:20.107
The register is said to be
indefinitely.

32:20.399 --> 32:24.444
Nobody lives in a hotel unless
is home or is hiding from someone.

32:24.736 --> 32:27.239
L É saba was the next.

32:27.531 --> 32:29.825
And the only person who saba why
saba he is in a bag plstico.

32:30.576 --> 32:31.869
- Excuse me.
- Now the only person ...

32:31.952 --> 32:33.620
mvil one is in a bag plstico.
All tracks that tenamos ...

32:33.787 --> 32:36.206
estn bags plstico.

32:51.889 --> 32:52.848
What

32:53.432 --> 32:55.767
Sean told me to help you today.

32:57.311 --> 32:59.354
- I was very excited.
- S.

33:04.818 --> 33:07.237
Perhaps the next time you should not
or a show or a seven-ye ...

33:07.237 --> 33:08.947
photos of the scene of a murder.

33:09.114 --> 33:13.452
Alex is not showed he found them
and I will remove them.

33:13.911 --> 33:15.120
Whatever.

33:17.956 --> 33:19.208
Hey Alex.

33:26.507 --> 33:30.844
Thank you for caring so well for Sean
has been very good with him.

33:33.430 --> 33:35.182
The meeting of parents of school
is tonight.

33:35.724 --> 33:37.768
- Last week I remembered.
-  What time

33:38.310 --> 33:42.439
- Like five minutes ago.
- Shit!  Shit!  Shit!

33:49.404 --> 33:54.326
Alex has a lot of potential and
that is why it is so frustrating.

33:55.035 --> 33:58.038
- Do not you do right
- It is wonderfully where is.

33:59.414 --> 34:00.958
But that's not very often.

34:02.125 --> 34:04.795
Alex is what we call a student
High performance ...

34:04.920 --> 34:06.547
without effort.

34:06.713 --> 34:10.592
You do not have to work hard
to do well who does not.

34:14.054 --> 34:16.849
Well that ...

34:18.851 --> 34:23.938
It's my fault. Not so long step
with them as I wanted.

34:25.440 --> 34:28.735
The therapist of the group to attend
that deca ...

34:28.819 --> 34:36.201
Moreover to be frank I think
is that Alex is good to try at least.

34:38.328 --> 34:41.790
It is not very common in boys than
have lost one parent.

34:44.418 --> 34:45.627
S.

34:47.420 --> 34:48.630
I'm sure.

34:59.349 --> 35:00.350
Ya est.

35:02.311 --> 35:04.605
Well go to bed.

35:05.439 --> 35:09.651
I was thinking that maybe Sean and
I can take you to school ma ana.

35:09.985 --> 35:13.363
- To make sure you go.
- good.

35:16.825 --> 35:17.910
Good night.

35:36.094 --> 35:38.472
Thanks for coming to see me.

35:38.639 --> 35:43.310
Nothing to do but Kristin I do not think
be the person I should talk.

35:43.810 --> 35:47.231
- I'm not trained for ...
- I want to talk to a normal person ...

35:47.940 --> 35:50.776
not with a man wearing starched
and a recorder.

35:52.361 --> 35:53.529
Agreed.

35:54.363 --> 35:59.493
But I tell you
I'm not very good with no os.

36:00.118 --> 36:03.539
- I'm not an a.
- No of course not.

36:06.416 --> 36:07.876
• You have children

36:09.336 --> 36:11.129
I have two children.

36:11.547 --> 36:13.590
What do things together

36:15.425 --> 36:18.554
Actually we do
many things together.

36:19.513 --> 36:21.223
Why not

36:22.641 --> 36:24.685
For many things.

36:26.228 --> 36:29.940
Sean was and still small or
I am known.

36:30.816 --> 36:37.447
Alex ... I was so concentrated
in my work ...

36:38.657 --> 36:40.909
I lost a child.

36:42.828 --> 36:44.621
My parents did.

36:48.417 --> 36:54.047
They thought that my mam was sterile
e iban to choose a baby ...

36:54.256 --> 37:00.304
but then my mam knew of orphanages
us the great ms.

37:01.638 --> 37:04.516
I remember the first time I saw her.

37:05.184 --> 37:11.523
Tena eight when I came to you.
I want to take it.

37:12.566 --> 37:16.737
Could not decrselo but just did.

37:19.114 --> 37:25.579
These measures were my parents
and I was her daughter.

37:27.873 --> 37:30.209
It was as it always is so.

37:31.835 --> 37:34.213
By following a birth or Teresa.

37:35.005 --> 37:37.299
Doctors said it was a miracle.

37:37.883 --> 37:39.885
It must have been difficult.

37:45.182 --> 37:47.434
Why people do
things you do

37:49.228 --> 37:50.896
I do not know.

38:07.704 --> 38:09.331
Sorry.

38:11.792 --> 38:16.004

I know what I am going to ask ...

39:10.267 --> 39:12.144
five minutes before you.

39:17.816 --> 39:20.027
Detective Breslin.

39:24.490 --> 39:29.453
If you say some things.

40:05.989 --> 40:09.743
Aidan I wonder what you think about m.

40:11.620 --> 40:15.874
Pens that was a sweet or slo ita

40:19.169 --> 40:22.589
- What do think now
- Still the same.

40:24.341 --> 40:25.592
You would

40:27.678 --> 40:32.683
As you know I knew that
have a special relationship.

40:36.812 --> 40:38.146
Why your mother

40:39.398 --> 40:42.276
- Because I hate my father.
- Why not him

40:43.777 --> 40:48.991
You prefer to be dead or
live the rest of his life without his beloved

40:49.867 --> 40:51.160
I prefer to be dead.

40:51.451 --> 40:54.246
Can be Kristin
You realize

40:58.584 --> 41:00.085
Why you delivered

41:00.252 --> 41:03.630
Longed to have a good conversacin.

41:07.801 --> 41:09.386
No eres la Muerte.

41:10.220 --> 41:12.890
Know the difference between death
and War detective

41:13.056 --> 41:16.518
S Death is a physical
War and a state minimum.

41:18.061 --> 41:19.354
He has reason.

41:20.522 --> 41:24.943
Death is what happens in the end
War is what others.

41:25.569 --> 41:27.279
What is the EDDM

41:29.698 --> 41:34.411
I want to say that he has not found

42:29.675 --> 42:31.009
Mary Anne Spitz.

42:34.012 --> 42:37.474
No wait.

42:38.308 --> 42:42.479
What are you feeling
It seems that podrs survive

42:42.938 --> 42:45.274
Should feel that justice exists.

42:46.024 --> 42:48.902
Still you do not feel dispensable

42:49.528 --> 42:53.866
Tu coraz?n te said that it
When your end

42:57.953 --> 42:59.746
Oh God!

42:59.913 --> 43:01.790

43:27.691 --> 43:31.778

Now you'll drown mam.

43:41.788 --> 43:43.665

Enough sleep

01:07:19.623 --> 01:07:25.003
It is more like what I've seen
someone to start an coraz?n.

01:07:39.017 --> 01:07:41.520
As he found Corey

01:07:43.021 --> 01:07:44.731

01:07:48.026 --> 01:07:50.779
- Corey was an amazing person.
- No doubt.

01:07:52.739 --> 01:07:54.741
Corey and T are different worlds.

01:07:57.828 --> 01:07:59.830
How do two people
as you know

01:08:00.956 --> 01:08:03.208
Want to know how people like

01:08:03.667 --> 01:08:07.129
We are nowhere  Cmo
not going to be

01:08:09.673 --> 01:08:14.344
The world from my room
and from Corey ...

01:08:14.553 --> 01:08:18.474
and that of anyone
looking for something or someone ...

01:08:18.599 --> 01:08:20.725
not found in your home.

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:26.231
And Taylor suffering

01:08:27.733 --> 01:08:32.029
S is pretty screwed.
That makes you happy

01:08:32.904 --> 01:08:37.408
Is that what you think  What is
we do is for our happiness

01:08:40.162 --> 01:08:42.497
Do not know anything about suffering.

01:08:44.207 --> 01:08:46.167
But now is giving attention "no

01:08:47.336 --> 01:08:49.379
Now I'm giving

I have four victims and
only two riders.

01:08:57.386 --> 01:09:01.265
Can save much time
and energy now.

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:06.145
Never catch the plague never.

01:09:07.104 --> 01:09:09.149
And the white horse rider ...

01:09:09.316 --> 01:09:14.571
Can not find someone as
someone as you find yourself.

01:09:15.863 --> 01:09:17.908
You would    It was as it happened

01:09:18.492 --> 01:09:20.868
• The horse rider of the horse
White found you ...

01:09:21.118 --> 01:09:24.957
and organizes all of this growth
a frmula to show the world

01:09:25.707 --> 01:09:29.586
S that is what makes a lder.

01:09:31.046 --> 01:09:34.131
Can learn a lot from him.

01:09:42.975 --> 01:09:44.475
Not as.

01:09:59.324 --> 01:10:00.534
Dnde is Sean

01:10:01.785 --> 01:10:05.414
I left to go to dinner at a friend's house.
I did not think you came.

01:10:12.713 --> 01:10:14.047
We talk

01:10:22.639 --> 01:10:25.601
This place is good.
Come with your friends

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.856
S sometimes with my friends but
Last I do alone.

01:10:31.857 --> 01:10:35.527
Sometimes I come after school

01:10:35.777 --> 01:10:37.738
t working.

01:10:40.324 --> 01:10:42.117

01:10:42.701 --> 01:10:45.329
once a week
and may do so ...

01:10:46.121 --> 01:10:47.706
something of ours.

01:10:50.751 --> 01:10:51.793
Clear.

01:10:56.006 --> 01:11:00.010
Pap Sean has started to
many questions.

01:11:01.053 --> 01:11:03.096
Why You are not ever
And stuff.

01:11:03.931 --> 01:11:09.353
They can answer them but will
begin to ask mam.

01:11:12.773 --> 01:11:16.318
Alex I want you to know that ...

01:11:17.903 --> 01:11:24.827
'm sorry you had to
spend that time alone with your mam.

01:11:27.287 --> 01:11:33.627
But you know anything that will

01:11:37.881 --> 01:11:42.719
Not that you have not been ah
That night it's not back.

01:11:48.517 --> 01:11:52.312
Everything you not with your mam
was difficult for everyone.

01:11:54.940 --> 01:12:01.155
But since I came back I am

01:12:04.867 --> 01:12:11.832
Alex if I am

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:22.926
-  Everyone differently
- I promise.

01:12:38.984 --> 01:12:43.447
The division of the West needs you
in a case of attempted violacin.

01:12:43.822 --> 01:12:45.240
Instruccin of the meeting is tonight.

01:12:46.241 --> 01:12:47.576
Hey Krupa wait wait.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.786
I do not have time for this.

01:12:50.704 --> 01:12:52.498
There are still two riders all out.

01:12:53.373 --> 01:12:56.210
We were told that there will be four victims
and we have four victims.

01:12:56.543 --> 01:12:58.921
No still have not finished.

01:12:59.630 --> 01:13:01.089
Let me explain something.

01:13:01.215 --> 01:13:05.344
Chose the Four Horsemen
of Revelation for a reason.

01:13:06.345 --> 01:13:08.847
Sabas that the word "Apocalypse"
not even mean the end of the world

01:13:09.181 --> 01:13:11.099
- No.
- The literal translation is ...

01:13:11.391 --> 01:13:13.685
"lifting the cloak."

01:13:14.937 --> 01:13:17.898
All this time have been trying
show us something.

01:13:18.023 --> 01:13:20.400
They have left tracks and all that.

01:13:20.651 --> 01:13:24.446
Look for AC. É this is the website
connected to the computer.

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.908
It is a template.
There are thousands of members.

01:13:28.909 --> 01:13:31.411
See that date
Is new not ah.

01:13:31.495 --> 01:13:33.914
When I first saw was the
space to write the pass a.

01:13:34.248 --> 01:13:34.998

01:13:35.082 --> 01:13:36.250
It ma ana.

01:13:37.251 --> 01:13:38.877
All this time has tried to
lead to something.

01:13:39.002 --> 01:13:40.504
Bring something  Not you see

01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:44.424
- What will come
- I do not know but pass ma ana.

01:13:45.801 --> 01:13:49.471
We know two of them. If we could
discover what connects them ...

01:13:49.555 --> 01:13:52.474
That leads us to the other two.

01:13:52.975 --> 01:13:55.519
- And I need more time for that.
- We have no more time.

01:13:56.728 --> 01:13:58.730
- Stop!
- Krupa!

01:13:58.981 --> 01:14:01.608
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
were sent ...

01:14:01.859 --> 01:14:04.111
to create Hell on Earth.

01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:06.738
And being ma ana.

01:14:14.621 --> 01:14:16.123
Well you have 24 hours.

01:14:22.045 --> 01:14:23.630
We have been leaving bread crumbs.

01:14:24.006 --> 01:14:28.010
I guess we have lost some
because ...

01:14:32.848 --> 01:14:34.057
Bres

01:14:38.061 --> 01:14:41.231
Four ales are all indicating
directions.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.362

01:15:47.881 --> 01:15:50.926
Garrison Jacobs forced us to punish
the innocent.

That only means that
There is a rider less.
