I guess I got distracted.
I'm sorry.

39:41.348 --> 39:43.849
Need to see your license.
Please step out of the car.

39:43.884 --> 39:46.652
O-okay.

39:48.155 --> 39:50.456
Uh, here you go.

39:50.491 --> 39:52.325
I mean,
I wasn't drinking, officer.

39:52.359 --> 39:55.060
Out of the car.
Okay.

40:06.408 --> 40:08.743
I know you...

40:08.777 --> 40:11.679
from the spa
down in Sugar Land.

40:13.382 --> 40:15.150
Good memory.

40:15.184 --> 40:17.419
Yeah.

40:17.454 --> 40:19.922
What are the chances of me
pulling you over like this?

40:21.758 --> 40:23.092
Pretty staggering.

40:27.297 --> 40:30.733
Well...seeing as how
you and me are old friends,

40:30.767 --> 40:33.069
I'll -- I'll just let you off
with a warning.

40:34.971 --> 40:37.273
I really appreciate
that.

40:38.342 --> 40:41.777
But, uh,
next time we meet...

40:41.812 --> 40:44.379
I might not be so nice.

40:46.450 --> 40:47.817
And I sure would hate
to see

40:47.851 --> 40:50.153
a nice girl like you
get into trouble.
