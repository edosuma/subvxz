WEBVTT

00:05.530 --> 00:07.920
So, Dad, how's it feel
being retired?

00:08.120 --> 00:11.620
I'm not retired,
I just don't work anymore.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.260
Isn't that the definition
of "retired"?

00:15.460 --> 00:17.600
Sure, I sold the Pit Stop,
all right,

00:17.800 --> 00:19.370
but I got a lot of irons
in the fire.

00:19.570 --> 00:22.800
Mark Cuban sold his company.
Do you call him retired?

00:23.000 --> 00:23.940
(chuckles)

00:24.140 --> 00:27.170
No, because he owns
a basketball team.

00:27.370 --> 00:29.710
Yeah, and, like,
60 other companies.

00:29.910 --> 00:33.550
And like a fool,
I invested in smartasses.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.250
(laughs)

00:35.450 --> 00:36.880
Oh, that's funny.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.180
(laughs)

00:38.380 --> 00:39.550
You know, I just had
a thought.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.250
Oh, she's been thinking
about this for a while.

00:41.450 --> 00:42.490
Mm-hmm.

00:42.690 --> 00:44.620
Maybe, Calvin,
I'm just thinking

00:44.820 --> 00:47.490
maybe now is a good time
for you and I

00:47.690 --> 00:48.830
to go on a vacation.

00:49.030 --> 00:51.660
Oh, so much planning
went into this moment.

00:51.860 --> 00:54.270
Remember when we didn't
take a honeymoon,

00:54.470 --> 00:56.970
and you said we will
when we have the money?

00:57.170 --> 00:58.840
Well, now we have the money,

00:59.040 --> 01:01.540
and you don't have to worry
about leaving the shop

01:01.740 --> 01:02.980
with someone else.
Hmm.

01:03.180 --> 01:05.780
She got him.
Mm-hmm.

01:05.980 --> 01:07.580
So now would be
a perfect time

01:07.780 --> 01:09.380
for us to take that
honeymoon we never had

01:09.580 --> 01:11.980
but always dreamed of.

01:12.190 --> 01:13.440
Madrid.

01:15.870 --> 01:18.620
She thinking
international?
Yes.

01:18.820 --> 01:23.000
Imagine long strolls
down cobblestone streets,

01:23.200 --> 01:25.230
wine and tapas at sunset.

01:25.430 --> 01:27.970
I do like small plates.
Right?

01:28.170 --> 01:31.000
Yeah, and how about
naps in hotel beds?

01:31.200 --> 01:33.540
I do like hotel beds.

01:33.740 --> 01:35.510
Well, let's do it.

01:35.710 --> 01:38.010
Definitely.
(boys cheer)

01:38.210 --> 01:39.350
Definitely.

01:39.550 --> 01:41.280
But not right now.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.320
You know,

01:43.520 --> 01:46.320
I started cleaning out
the garage, and, you know,

01:46.520 --> 01:48.690
that's a whole thing,
that's gonna take a while.

01:48.890 --> 01:49.720
So, you know.

01:49.920 --> 01:52.490
Come on, Calvin,
we never travel.

01:52.690 --> 01:54.730
We just went to San Diego.

01:54.930 --> 01:56.800
We took a two-hour
car ride

01:57.000 --> 01:59.500
so you guys could go to that
miniature engineering museum.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.100
(laughs)
You remember that tiny crane?

02:02.300 --> 02:05.220
(imitating hydraulics)

02:06.360 --> 02:09.860
(laughter)
It was so cute.
It was so cute.

02:11.290 --> 02:15.050
Come on, babe, we just
can't leave the country.

02:15.250 --> 02:17.380
What if something happened
to one of our kids?

02:17.580 --> 02:20.100
Like what, they lose a tooth?

02:21.670 --> 02:22.920
They're grown-ass men.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.090
And that Pit Stop is not
your problem anymore.

02:25.290 --> 02:27.830
You know, I have been
waiting decades

02:28.030 --> 02:29.400
just to have you
all to myself,

02:29.600 --> 02:32.130
and you know what,
I am tired of waiting.

02:32.330 --> 02:34.080
Okay, Tina...

02:35.280 --> 02:36.500
Hey, come on, Pop.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.870
Mom supported your dream
of growing your business

02:39.070 --> 02:40.240
for 30 years.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.010
Now it's your turn
to support her dreams.

02:42.210 --> 02:43.880
But I hate traveling.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.410
It's so expensive,

02:45.610 --> 02:47.610
there's always
so many people around,

02:47.810 --> 02:51.720
and there's never anything
to eat but Sbarro's.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.090
They always promise
other things are gonna be open,

02:54.290 --> 02:57.720
but it's only Sbarro's.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.010
Daddy.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.330
You got to do it.

03:02.530 --> 03:03.910
While you still can.

03:05.910 --> 03:07.750
How old do you think I am?

03:09.050 --> 03:11.440
Ah, goodness.

03:11.640 --> 03:13.370
Your mother was really excited

03:13.570 --> 03:14.670
about this trip idea,
though, huh?

03:14.870 --> 03:16.640
Yeah, and I guarantee
those tickets are

03:16.840 --> 03:18.210
pulled up on her computer.

03:18.410 --> 03:20.010
MARTY:
Mm-hmm.

03:20.210 --> 03:21.880
Yeah.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.100
Tina, baby?

03:26.170 --> 03:28.250
Let's go eat
tiny portions of meat.

03:28.450 --> 03:30.890
Oh, baby, mmm-mmm-mmm.

03:31.090 --> 03:32.290
Thank you!

03:32.490 --> 03:34.760
Okay, our flight leaves
at 2:45 on Wednesday,

03:34.960 --> 03:39.080
or as they say in España,
<i>miércoles.</i>

03:40.680 --> 03:42.570
* Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood *

03:42.770 --> 03:44.120
* Welcome to the hood. *

03:49.490 --> 03:51.140
("Shave and a Haircut"
knock on door)

03:51.340 --> 03:52.280
BOTH:
Dave.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.050
Oh, he's gonna be mad

03:54.250 --> 03:55.930
that we're playing a board game
without him.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.720
Hey!
Oh, hey, guys, listen.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.050
We were thinking,
with your dad retiring and all,

04:02.250 --> 04:03.810
that maybe we would...

04:09.410 --> 04:11.850
You guys playing Scrabble
without me?

04:12.880 --> 04:14.570
You challenge every word, Dave.

04:14.770 --> 04:17.050
It is my right, Malcolm.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.170
Anyway, we thought
it would be nice

04:21.370 --> 04:23.340
if we got your dad a present
as a congrats

04:23.540 --> 04:24.580
for selling the shop.

04:24.780 --> 04:26.080
What if we got him
a fondue set?

04:26.280 --> 04:27.310
Or is that too obvious?

04:27.510 --> 04:28.780
GEMMA:
Ooh...

04:28.980 --> 04:30.780
What if we got them
a Jacuzzi?

04:30.980 --> 04:32.920
It could be waiting for them in
their backyard when they return.

04:33.120 --> 04:36.320
Hmm, Dad's not too into
sitting idly in hot water.

04:36.520 --> 04:37.760
I can hear him now.
(scoffs)

04:37.960 --> 04:41.240
"What am I, some kind of
food cart hot dog?"

04:42.380 --> 04:45.400
You know, Pop did mention
he was cleaning out the garage.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.770
We could finish
that job for him.

04:46.970 --> 04:48.100
Oh.
Yes.

04:48.300 --> 04:49.740
We could clean it out
and set it up as a space

04:49.940 --> 04:51.190
for him to work
on his cars.

04:51.690 --> 04:55.440
A secret reno
for a worthy recipient.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.490
How HGTV of us.

05:00.030 --> 05:03.320
If I've said it once,
I've said it a hundred times:

05:03.520 --> 05:05.680
checking a bag is
never a good idea.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.590
You've said it a hundred times.

05:07.790 --> 05:10.420
You remember when
we went to Kansas City,

05:10.620 --> 05:11.560
and they lost my luggage?

05:11.760 --> 05:13.890
I had to flip my drawers
every day

05:14.090 --> 05:15.180
for a week.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.560
Okay...
Babe,

05:18.760 --> 05:21.570
are we visiting Spain
or moving there?

05:21.770 --> 05:23.470
Well, I need nine
daytime looks

05:23.670 --> 05:24.970
and eight nighttime looks.

05:25.170 --> 05:27.740
(chuckles)
You need to learn
to pack like me.

05:27.940 --> 05:30.040
Two pairs of shorts,
three shirts,

05:30.240 --> 05:32.860
and ten pairs of drawers
for safety.

05:35.730 --> 05:37.350
MAN:
Next.

05:37.550 --> 05:38.520
Oh, good.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.020
Are you checking
any bags today?

05:40.220 --> 05:41.450
Well, uh, my wife is.

05:41.650 --> 05:43.220
I know better than
to be separated

05:43.420 --> 05:44.640
from my belongings.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.060
Yeah, here we go.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.430
Ma'am,

05:49.630 --> 05:51.950
your bag is three pounds
over the limit.

05:54.450 --> 05:58.000
Really, Ronnie? I mean,
what are you, the pound police?

05:58.200 --> 06:00.160
That's literally my job.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.680
Okay, fine, I'll just
take some stuff

06:04.880 --> 06:09.210
out of my bag
and put it in yours. Okay...

06:09.410 --> 06:11.930
She couldn't see this coming?

06:13.140 --> 06:16.020
All right, then.
Okay, all right, fine.

06:16.220 --> 06:18.720
I'll just take a few things
out of here.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.160
Okay, oh. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.160
What?

06:22.360 --> 06:25.760
They touched the floor!

06:25.960 --> 06:29.070
Calvin, my underwear touched
the airport floor!

06:29.270 --> 06:33.740
Babe, babe, you are literally
yelling about your underwear

06:33.940 --> 06:35.120
at the airport.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.610
Oh, my God. Ugh!
What are you doing?

06:37.810 --> 06:39.380
Tina...
Okay.

06:39.580 --> 06:41.680
Tina-- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.070
Okay. All right.

06:45.630 --> 06:49.050
Tina, Tina...
calm-calm down, babe, okay?

06:49.250 --> 06:50.520
All right, I'm
gonna calm down.
Just think,

06:50.720 --> 06:53.490
now, in 15 hours
you'll be sipping sangria

06:53.690 --> 06:55.660
under string lights, okay?

06:55.860 --> 06:58.560
Yeah. I like string lights.
Yes, yes.

06:58.760 --> 06:59.570
Okay.
Okay.

06:59.770 --> 07:00.870
Here we go.

07:01.070 --> 07:02.100
All right, um,
you hold that, hold that.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.220
Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll take this.

07:07.320 --> 07:10.480
Whew, look at that.
Nice and light.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.600
So light.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.770
Two pounds over.

07:17.630 --> 07:19.690
Damn it, Ronnie, I swear,
you not gonna--

07:19.890 --> 07:22.200
Ronnie think I'm playing.

07:23.440 --> 07:24.890
Everything in here is junk.

07:25.090 --> 07:28.560
Uh, I'm sorry, you're calling
both of these VHS tapes

07:28.760 --> 07:29.960
of <i>Mighty Joe Young</i> junk?

07:30.160 --> 07:31.900
(laughs)

07:32.100 --> 07:33.800
You know, this is the part
of the home reno show

07:34.000 --> 07:35.670
where they hire somebody
to come in

07:35.870 --> 07:37.240
and do all this work for them.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.740
Oh, that's a great idea.

07:38.940 --> 07:40.810
I can call one of those
junk removal companies.

07:41.010 --> 07:42.480
You guys move all this junk
onto the driveway,

07:42.680 --> 07:44.710
we can go get brunch,
and by the time we get back,

07:44.910 --> 07:46.710
all this stuff will be gone.

07:46.910 --> 07:49.110
Wait a minute.
Are y'all really that lazy?

07:49.310 --> 07:50.300
I am.

07:51.630 --> 07:53.450
(scanner beeps)

07:53.650 --> 07:55.790
(beep)
Oh, Mr. Butler,
we're gonna have to ask you

07:55.990 --> 07:57.290
to check your carry-on.

07:57.490 --> 08:00.280
Well, thank you for asking,
but my answer is no.

08:01.140 --> 08:03.130
The flight is overbooked.

08:03.330 --> 08:05.260
There's no more room
in the overhead compartment.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.830
Well, I'll-I'll just stick it
under my seat.

08:08.030 --> 08:12.170
Babe, just give her the bag
so we can get to Madrid.

08:12.370 --> 08:14.210
Please.
Thank you.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.640
Yeah.
Thank you.

08:16.840 --> 08:17.940
Okay.
(beep)

08:18.140 --> 08:21.360
Go. It's about to be some
tapas up in here.

08:23.430 --> 08:24.620
(beep)

08:24.820 --> 08:27.440
Oh, we're gonna need
you to check your bag.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.960
Look at this beautiful
junk-free driveway.

08:35.160 --> 08:36.230
You know, calling
the trash people

08:36.430 --> 08:38.100
while we got brunch
was brilliant.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.870
(laughs)
All we had to do
was eat biscuits.

08:41.070 --> 08:42.270
Some of us didn't see
the biscuits

08:42.470 --> 08:44.120
until all the biscuits
were gone.

08:49.220 --> 08:52.340
Oh, wow, it is
actually huge in here.

08:52.540 --> 08:55.210
Okay, now the best man caves
always have themes.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.920
Now, what are we thinking?
Tiki bar? Sports memorabilia?

08:58.120 --> 09:01.150
Oh, actually, you know
what's really cool?

09:01.350 --> 09:03.360
Swords.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.090
Or, or, instead of swords,

09:06.290 --> 09:09.110
maybe it could be
"garage-themed."

09:10.410 --> 09:13.400
Uh, Dad, where is
Mr. Calvin's smoker?

09:13.600 --> 09:15.130
It's in the driveway,
where it always is.

09:15.330 --> 09:16.200
No, it's not.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.050
What?

09:19.390 --> 09:20.840
The smoker's not here.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.010
Maybe they moved it
so they'd have

09:22.210 --> 09:23.610
easier access to the trash.

09:23.810 --> 09:25.110
No, it's gone.

09:25.310 --> 09:27.450
Maybe they thought
it <i>was</i> trash.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.720
You did put those piles
kind of close to the smoker.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.580
You watched us move it all,
Marty.

09:31.780 --> 09:32.620
You didn't say any of that.

09:32.820 --> 09:34.020
Hey, man.

09:34.220 --> 09:36.690
Marty, don't you think
you should have been

09:36.890 --> 09:37.820
a little more clear?

09:38.020 --> 09:39.860
Well, David, don't you think

09:40.060 --> 09:41.130
you should have put the trash
further away

09:41.330 --> 09:42.330
from Dad's most prized
possession?!

09:42.530 --> 09:44.110
Don't put this on me!

09:45.480 --> 09:46.880
(phone ringing)

09:48.050 --> 09:49.300
Oh, no, that's Mama.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.570
Don't answer it.

09:50.770 --> 09:52.540
Oh, there's no way
I'm answering that.

09:52.740 --> 09:55.670
(phone ringing)

09:55.870 --> 09:58.410
Oh, it's a video call.
Don't answer it!

09:58.610 --> 10:00.010
I have to, it's Mommy.

10:00.210 --> 10:01.550
No, Marty, don't...

10:01.750 --> 10:03.080
Hi, Mommy.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.080
What, your brother's sending me
to voice mail now?

10:05.280 --> 10:08.120
Oh, no, no, I meant to hit
the green button, Mama.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.320
I-I just wanted y'all to see
that your father's

10:10.520 --> 10:12.860
on a actual plane.
Look. (laughs)

10:13.060 --> 10:14.690
Hey!
Hey!

10:14.890 --> 10:16.830
The Butlers are
international, baby!

10:17.030 --> 10:18.660
Hey, where are y'all?

10:18.860 --> 10:20.430
Uh, nowhere.

10:20.630 --> 10:22.670
Yeah, no, we was out here
playing pickleball.
Hello, Calvin.

10:22.870 --> 10:26.300
Shh! You know what, y'all
should go on airplane mode.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.020
Have a great flight.

10:30.090 --> 10:32.830
He's gonna kill us.

10:40.670 --> 10:41.450
Okay.

10:41.650 --> 10:43.460
You know what, I'll just--

10:43.660 --> 10:45.620
I'll just put it right up
under my seat, like I said.

10:45.820 --> 10:47.330
No problem.

10:47.530 --> 10:51.030
Yeah, all right.
Yeah. Okay.

10:51.230 --> 10:52.800
We did it.
(laughs)

10:53.000 --> 10:56.740
I am so excited.
I can almost taste the paella.

10:56.940 --> 10:59.910
Excuse me. Sorry.
Uh, I'm the window.

11:00.110 --> 11:01.170
Oh.
Okay.

11:01.370 --> 11:02.240
You got it, amigo.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.610
Yes.
There you go.

11:03.810 --> 11:05.240
All right. Good?

11:05.440 --> 11:07.310
Here we go.
All right. Come, boy.

11:07.510 --> 11:09.110
Oh, you have a dog.

11:09.310 --> 11:13.820
Oh. Oh, okay.
(laughs)

11:14.020 --> 11:15.190
TINA:
All right, there you go.
Okay, all right.

11:15.390 --> 11:17.470
Okay.
All right.

11:19.610 --> 11:21.630
Where the hell
is this horse going?

11:21.830 --> 11:23.230
You know,

11:23.430 --> 11:24.860
this is my seat.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.900
My-my seat comes
with space for my legs.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.130
Your dog is in my leg space.

11:29.330 --> 11:30.270
You don't like dogs?

11:30.470 --> 11:31.600
I like dogs fine.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.110
Well, you can pet him
if you like.

11:33.310 --> 11:34.860
I don't like.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.540
You need to take your seats now

11:37.740 --> 11:39.080
so we can have
an on-time departure.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.080
Sherlock, sit.
Calvin, sit.

11:42.280 --> 11:46.150
I can't take my seat because,
as a human who paid for my seat,

11:46.350 --> 11:48.720
I have nowhere
to put my human legs

11:48.920 --> 11:51.990
because Shaggy here
is traveling to Spain

11:52.190 --> 11:53.860
with Scooby-Doo.

11:54.060 --> 11:55.990
This man does not
like dogs!

11:56.190 --> 11:57.800
(all booing)

11:58.000 --> 11:59.230
Dog-ophobe!

11:59.430 --> 12:01.030
No, no, no, he loves dogs.

12:01.230 --> 12:03.400
He cried at <i>Marley & Me.</i>

12:03.600 --> 12:05.770
You know what?
Since y'all like dogs so much,

12:05.970 --> 12:07.610
then somebody switch seats
with me.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.180
TINA: Yeah.
CALVIN: Huh? Yeah.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.640
That's what I thought.

12:12.850 --> 12:14.680
Sir, I need you
to take your seat.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.580
We can't push away from the gate
until you're in your seat.

12:16.780 --> 12:18.220
WOMAN:
Sit down!
(overlapping shouting)

12:18.420 --> 12:20.190
Oh, no. Oh, you know what?

12:20.390 --> 12:22.500
I'll sit down
when the moose moves.

12:23.570 --> 12:27.190
Uh-uh. That bag was tagged
to be gate-checked.

12:27.390 --> 12:28.790
It's in the system.

12:28.990 --> 12:30.160
Well, just untag it.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.430
It doesn't work like that.

12:31.630 --> 12:33.400
Once it's tagged,
it's tagged for life.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.600
We're going to have
to open up the doors again.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.170
And that will cause a delay.
(crowd clamoring)

12:37.370 --> 12:39.040
Well...
Nice work, Karen!

12:39.240 --> 12:41.470
I-I... I am not a Karen.
(overlapping shouting)

12:41.670 --> 12:43.210
You know what?
I need to see your manager.

12:43.410 --> 12:45.530
I don't...
I don't feel safe right now.

12:46.630 --> 12:47.910
It's already
in the landfill?!

12:48.110 --> 12:51.920
You're supposed
to repurpose this stuff!

12:52.120 --> 12:54.250
No, I will not hold
for a survey!

12:54.450 --> 12:56.860
(scoffs)

12:57.060 --> 12:59.690
Well, I guess we're buying
Calvin a new smoker.

12:59.890 --> 13:01.430
The old one was getting
kind of gross anyway.

13:01.630 --> 13:03.200
Uh, Gemma, Gemma, Gemma,

13:03.400 --> 13:05.960
one does not simply
replace Dad's smoker.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.100
Yeah, that thing had 20 years
of seasoning on it.

13:09.300 --> 13:10.770
That's why
the food tastes so good.

13:10.970 --> 13:13.420
Even the broccoli he cooked
on there tasted like brisket.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.940
It's gonna ruin his vacation
when he hears.

13:17.140 --> 13:19.630
What the hell is wrong
with you, man?
Whoa... what the hell, Dave?

13:21.260 --> 13:23.320
Okay, we are not
telling him, okay?

13:23.520 --> 13:26.630
They are probably having the
time of their lives right now.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.960
VIRGINIA:
Flight 2355 to Madrid.

13:30.160 --> 13:33.030
We appreciate your patience
in deplaning.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.880
This is on you, dog hater.

13:37.410 --> 13:39.100
I love dogs, lady.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.770
I also love
Earth, Wind & Fire.

13:40.970 --> 13:42.950
I just don't want 'em
under my seat.

13:45.220 --> 13:47.660
Due to the delay...

13:50.330 --> 13:52.540
...our flight crew has gone over
their allotted hours.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.860
We are currently looking
for a new crew.

13:55.800 --> 13:59.050
Oh, wait. No!
No, no, no, don't leave!

13:59.250 --> 14:01.620
Y-You can work
a little longer, right?

14:01.820 --> 14:04.290
I-I mean, come on. Doctors do
surgeries for over 19 hours.

14:04.490 --> 14:06.090
Y'all can push
a little drink cart.

14:06.290 --> 14:08.830
VIRGINIA:
We'd also like
to welcome passengers

14:09.030 --> 14:12.930
from the recently-canceled
Flight 510 to Madrid.

14:13.130 --> 14:15.800
Due to our combining
these flights, we are oversold

14:16.000 --> 14:19.670
and offering $2,000 to any
passengers willing to be bumped.

14:19.870 --> 14:22.240
Did you hear that, baby?
What?

14:22.440 --> 14:23.940
$2,000.

14:24.140 --> 14:25.940
You're not really thinking
of taking that, are you?

14:26.140 --> 14:27.980
I mean, Tina,
for that kind of money,

14:28.180 --> 14:31.630
we can get out of this hellhole
and go to Pechanga Casino.

14:32.430 --> 14:34.590
I mean, maybe
this is the universe

14:34.790 --> 14:36.720
trying to tell us something.
Yes.

14:36.920 --> 14:39.890
It's the universe telling me
I'm never getting my honeymoon.

14:40.090 --> 14:42.910
You know, I'm going to go get
a glass of wine at Sbarro.

14:48.450 --> 14:50.140
And this is the same
as Dad's?

14:50.340 --> 14:52.140
Same model.

14:52.340 --> 14:55.990
This is so clean.
Did you buy this from a vegan?

14:57.330 --> 15:00.250
Okay, guys, we're never going
to be able to pass this off.

15:00.450 --> 15:01.950
I agree.

15:02.150 --> 15:04.620
So I think we should
all band together

15:04.820 --> 15:05.950
and blame Dave.

15:06.150 --> 15:07.750
GEMMA:
What? Dave?!

15:07.950 --> 15:09.550
Mm-hmm.
Marty is the one
who made the call.

15:09.750 --> 15:10.560
Let's blame him.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.220
Okay.
Girl!

15:12.420 --> 15:13.660
Okay, you know what?

15:13.860 --> 15:15.660
How about we pin it on Grover?

15:15.860 --> 15:17.960
There's no way my dad's gonna
hit a little white boy.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.900
Yeah.
No!

15:20.100 --> 15:22.430
None of you are
thinking straight!

15:22.630 --> 15:25.070
If you had watched HGTV,
you would know

15:25.270 --> 15:27.270
that this is the moment
where all seems lost.

15:27.470 --> 15:28.610
And then

15:28.810 --> 15:31.980
they get the perfect
renovation solution.

15:32.180 --> 15:34.580
We're going
to antique this bad boy.

15:34.780 --> 15:35.950
Wait. Will that work?

15:36.150 --> 15:37.120
Yes, it'll work.

15:37.320 --> 15:38.680
Gemma, go get
a hundred burgers.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.650
Marty, get a buttload
of hickory chips. Malcolm,

15:40.850 --> 15:42.750
we're going
to need a baseball bat.

15:42.950 --> 15:45.690
No one sleeps until
this smoker looks like crap

15:45.890 --> 15:48.240
and smells fantastic!

15:50.480 --> 15:52.550
Excuse me.
Excu-Excuse me.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.070
I knew it. I knew.

15:55.270 --> 15:57.270
$2,000 was just
gonna be too tempting.

15:57.470 --> 15:59.200
Hold on, baby. Just...
No, no, no.
You know what?

15:59.400 --> 16:01.210
I have had enough, okay?

16:01.410 --> 16:02.670
Let's just go home.

16:02.870 --> 16:04.510
This has been
a complete disaster.

16:04.710 --> 16:06.880
Tina, it has been.
(sighs)

16:07.080 --> 16:09.980
But that's why
I upgraded us to first class,

16:10.180 --> 16:14.070
where, I assume,
all the dogs are inside purses.

16:16.070 --> 16:17.860
Really, babe?

16:18.060 --> 16:20.860
Are you sure, Calvin?
This is expensive.

16:21.060 --> 16:23.830
Yeah, well,
the universe spoke to me again,

16:24.030 --> 16:27.080
and it said,
"You only get one honeymoon."

16:28.580 --> 16:30.650
(laughs softly)
Baby. Mmm.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.010
Mmm. Oh, uh,

16:35.210 --> 16:38.910
my man, there's not a purse
in the world big enough for you.

16:39.110 --> 16:40.980
Yeah.

16:41.180 --> 16:43.280
(barks)

16:43.480 --> 16:45.970
* *

16:51.840 --> 16:53.490
Aah!

16:53.690 --> 16:56.460
* *

16:56.660 --> 16:58.950
Grease it up, boy!

17:13.100 --> 17:15.900
* *

17:25.940 --> 17:28.010
(glass breaking,
car alarm blaring)

17:34.450 --> 17:35.700
* *

17:35.900 --> 17:37.540
Wow. We did
a great job.

17:37.740 --> 17:40.440
That thing
looks terrible.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.540
Now for the final test.

17:42.740 --> 17:44.180
Grover?!

17:44.380 --> 17:45.680
* *

17:45.880 --> 17:48.060
What does this asparagus
taste like?

17:49.500 --> 17:51.730
* *

17:53.470 --> 17:54.320
Ribs?

17:54.520 --> 17:56.140
(all cheering)

18:00.880 --> 18:03.530
(romantic guitar music playing)

18:03.730 --> 18:06.330
Mmm. Babe, you would think

18:06.530 --> 18:09.200
that the tiny portions would
mean there's not enough food,

18:09.400 --> 18:12.140
but I have never eaten so much
in my life.

18:12.340 --> 18:13.610
(laughs)

18:13.810 --> 18:16.640
Ooh. Is it too late
in the day for a siesta?

18:16.840 --> 18:18.980
You know, you look beautiful
in that dress.

18:19.180 --> 18:20.450
Oh.
Mm.

18:20.650 --> 18:22.050
And I love you in that shirt.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.420
And I look forward
to seeing it three more times.

18:24.620 --> 18:28.390
(both laughing)

18:28.590 --> 18:30.460
You know,

18:30.660 --> 18:33.020
I've always been worried
about...

18:33.230 --> 18:34.830
working so hard.

18:35.030 --> 18:39.960
I... I never took the time
to enjoy the fruits of my labor.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.270
But...

18:42.470 --> 18:45.470
traveling the world
with my beautiful wife,

18:45.670 --> 18:49.340
drinking good wine and eating
cheese I can't pronounce...

18:49.540 --> 18:52.040
(laughs)

18:52.240 --> 18:53.880
This.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.660
This is what I want.

18:57.130 --> 19:00.100
Well, this
and playing golf with Ice Cube.

19:03.070 --> 19:05.560
Well, it took
30 years, but...

19:05.760 --> 19:08.990
I finally got my boyfriend back.
(laughs)

19:09.190 --> 19:11.180
Mmm. Mwah.

19:12.450 --> 19:14.900
Well, maybe I like
being retired after all.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.070
Well, you're going to really
love being retired in Fiji

19:17.270 --> 19:18.570
'cause
that's where we're going next.

19:18.770 --> 19:21.310
Hmm.

19:21.510 --> 19:23.110
I like Fiji.
Yeah?

19:23.310 --> 19:26.180
'Cause we won't need
any underwear there.

19:26.380 --> 19:28.900
* *

19:36.600 --> 19:38.460
ALL:
Surprise!

19:38.660 --> 19:42.190
Oh, my.
(laughs)

19:42.390 --> 19:43.730
Well, all right!

19:43.930 --> 19:46.260
(laughs)
Hey.

19:46.460 --> 19:47.830
Yeah. We wanted to do something

19:48.030 --> 19:49.730
to say congratulations
on selling the shop.

19:49.930 --> 19:52.370
Yeah, congrats, Pop. Now you can
still work on your cars.

19:52.570 --> 19:54.790
Yeah, and just not
get paid for it.

19:55.590 --> 19:57.540
Y'all did all of this
while we were gone?

19:57.740 --> 19:59.680
There was a lot of junk in here.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.910
Oh, girl, we know.
(laughs)

20:02.110 --> 20:04.820
(laughing): Yeah.
Well, I must say,
I am impressed.

20:05.020 --> 20:07.050
Thank you. Thank you, guys.
DAVE:
Well,

20:07.250 --> 20:10.390
we're glad you like it, and,
of course, there's your smoker,

20:10.590 --> 20:12.460
exactly where you thought
it would be,

20:12.660 --> 20:16.460
totally unchanged,
like nothing happened at all.

20:16.660 --> 20:17.930
Pull-pull it back, Dave.
Easy. Easy, Dave.

20:18.130 --> 20:19.230
Pull it back, pull it back.
Come-come on back.

20:19.430 --> 20:21.000
MALCOLM:
Yeah.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.830
Yeah. Well, there's my baby.

20:23.030 --> 20:24.300
I'm sure gonna miss her.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.640
