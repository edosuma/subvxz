30:32.831 --> 30:34.241
OK, Where's your car?

30:34.416 --> 30:35.405
- My car?
- Yeah.

30:35.584 --> 30:38.417
- My keys are back in the room, genius!
- I don't care Where your keys are!

30:38.587 --> 30:40.919
- Show me Where your car is!
- This beautiful piece of...

30:41.089 --> 30:43.000
Hi, little baby. HOW you doing?

30:43.175 --> 30:45.257
NICK:
Over here. Come on.

30:45.427 --> 30:49.966
- That's my car, man.
- Get in. Stay put.

30:50.849 --> 30:55.092
- But that...
- Yeah.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.226
Hey, that looks like my tattoo.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.777
We're definitely in the right place.

31:02.945 --> 31:04.401
Come on.

31:05.614 --> 31:08.356
- So, what are you looking for?
- I don't know, a clue.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.401
You want a clue? Here's a clue:
you're fuckin' crazy, man.

31:11.578 --> 31:14.365
- A clue to the next round.
- The next round.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.953
- The clue to round five.
- Round five.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.963
Oh, no, no, no, dude,
I am not into that.

31:25.133 --> 31:29.001
Five fingers. Round five.

31:29.179 --> 31:31.170
There's something in here.

31:32.891 --> 31:33.971
What the hell is that?

31:34.142 --> 31:36.133
I don't know,
it looks like coordinates.

31:36.311 --> 31:37.687
Let's see.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.560
Let's see, it's GPS.

please don't hurt me!

32:01.044 --> 32:03.376
OK, let's see it.

to when they find the bike.

Scroll ahead.

32:14.808 --> 32:17.595
Stop. Play it from here.

32:17.769 --> 32:21.102
See, now what kind of an EMT
leaves his patient to take a call?

32:21.273 --> 32:23.605
- Maybe it's important.
- Or convenient.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.107
Stepping out right before it explodes?

32:26.278 --> 32:29.862
- Let's find out who he's talking to.
- Yeah, I'm on it.

32:30.741 --> 32:32.106
MAN:
Well, that's Malloy.

32:32.284 --> 32:35.071
At least now we know who the corpse isn't.

32:35.245 --> 32:37.907
MCKENZIE: Do you see that?
The way he's looking at the camera?

32:38.081 --> 32:41.494
Yeah. That's right, buddy,
smile for the camera.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.499
That's not it.

32:43.670 --> 32:47.254
That doesn't look like someone
who just blew up his own ambulance.

32:47.424 --> 32:50.086
It does if he knows
he's being filmed.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.501
Right there. He did it again.

32:53.388 --> 32:56.471
No, it's like he's looking
at whoever he's talking to.

32:56.642 --> 33:00.510
Like... the camera's watching him.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.803
Check the signal, see if it's being tapped

33:02.981 --> 33:04.721
- by any outside sources.
- Yeah, no problem.

33:05.901 --> 33:08.062

Sykes.

33:18.580 --> 33:19.911
Yeah. We'll be right there.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.833
Someone fitting Malloy's description
just trashed a motel in Chinatown

33:25.003 --> 33:27.460
and abducted one of their guests.

33:28.924 --> 33:30.789
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

33:30.967 --> 33:33.094
OK, here we go.

33:33.261 --> 33:36.424
Monroe, do you want
to get on that? Make the call.

33:45.857 --> 33:50.521
- Look, man, if this is about money...
- Is that what this is about, money?

33:50.696 --> 33:52.527
That is why you kidnapped me, right?

33:52.698 --> 33:54.814
- I didn't kidnap you.
- Really?

33:54.991 --> 33:57.983
That's not what it looks like
from where I'm sitting!

33:59.287 --> 34:00.993
I mean, what other
reason would there be?

34:01.164 --> 34:02.449
I don't know, you tell me.

34:02.624 --> 34:06.867
Wait, wait, I'm supposed to tell you
why you kidnapped...

34:07.045 --> 34:09.582
Look, I didn't want to do any of this.
I didn't have a choice.

34:09.756 --> 34:12.623
- I don't want money.
- Then what do you want?

34:12.801 --> 34:14.007
I don't want anything, all right?

34:14.177 --> 34:16.668
The guy that called your motel room
is behind all of this.

34:16.847 --> 34:19.964
He's already killed one person,
he's threatened my wife,

34:20.142 --> 34:23.726
and he won't stop
unless I play his crazy game.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.272
And what does that
have to do with me?

34:26.440 --> 34:30.649
I don't know yet.
But there has to be a connection.

Hey, hold on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

You hear that beeping?

34:42.539 --> 34:44.825
- That's my Iocator.
- Locator?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.207
Yeah. I'm on parole, bitch.

34:47.377 --> 34:50.835
Which Ijust violated because of you.
So thanks a lot, asshole.

34:51.006 --> 34:52.587
What are you on parole for?

34:52.758 --> 34:56.125
MAN: Congratulations, Nick.
That's another one in your column.

34:56.303 --> 34:59.511
And we are almost at the halfway point.
Very exciting.

34:59.681 --> 35:02.764
- Who is that?
- Ah! Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

35:02.934 --> 35:06.472
Welcome to the game.
Now, I am sure your new best friend

35:06.646 --> 35:10.264
has filled you in on the details.
And, Nick, I don't know if you've noticed,

35:10.442 --> 35:13.184
but Tommy is wearing
an electronic tracking bracelet.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.613
Now, because you've been
following the rules,

35:15.781 --> 35:17.521
I'm gonna give you a little help.

35:17.699 --> 35:20.031
I have blocked the signal
to Tommy's anklet,

35:20.202 --> 35:23.160
so the police can't find you... yet.

35:23.330 --> 35:26.493
We wouldn't want to end our fun
so soon, now, would we, boys?

35:26.666 --> 35:31.330
But... let me leave you both
with a little reminder.

He said 12 rounds. Why 12?

36:08.708 --> 36:12.166
- TOMMY: I don't know, man.
- There has to be a connection.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.919
Your anklet, why are you on parole?

36:15.090 --> 36:18.582
It was a... a DUI.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.921
Stupid mistake.
I got out two days ago.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.757
And you don't think
that's a coincidence?

36:22.931 --> 36:25.138
Man, I told you, I don't know
what any of this Shit is about.

36:25.308 --> 36:28.391
- Maybe someone you knew in prison?
- I wasn't in prison, I was in rehab.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.974
- That was money well spent.
- Hey, I was celebrating.

36:31.147 --> 36:34.731
And besides, you don't look like you're
doing too bad, driving a car like this.

36:34.901 --> 36:37.313
Hey, fuck you. This isn't my car.

36:38.321 --> 36:41.779
- Well, whose car is it?
- I don't know.

36:41.950 --> 36:45.238
Why don't you check the glove box,
see if there's any registration in there.

36:50.417 --> 36:54.285
The owner is Roberta Shaw.
Do you know her?

36:54.462 --> 36:56.589
No. You?

36:58.800 --> 37:00.381
Yeah, I do.

37:02.679 --> 37:04.465
That was my lawyer.

37:07.684 --> 37:11.268
Tell me we just got really lucky
and it failed to go off.

37:11.438 --> 37:15.647
It's deactivated. Get this,
Malloy told the clerk about it.

37:15.817 --> 37:17.557
Told him to call the cops.

domestic terrorist ever?

Yeah, guys, the truth is, this signal's
being rerouted all over the place.

37:46.139 --> 37:49.552
We can't trace it. Whoever's doing this
clearly doesn't want us to find him.

an EMT could do to you?

- Guy's got to have a hobby.
- Figure it out.

All right.

Man, what am I supposed to be looking for?

38:14.834 --> 38:16.210

38:16.378 --> 38:18.289
- What?
- The scales.

38:18.463 --> 38:19.669
What about it?

38:19.839 --> 38:22.046
When he first called,
he said something about scales.

38:22.217 --> 38:25.380
That they were out of whack,
and I had to help him rebalance them.

But, um... maybe not.

OK, I want to know
everything about Malloy.

he'd have a grudge against this kid.

- Put out an APB on Malloy.

At least now we know
who we're looking for.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.404
He's the governor's kid.

42:25.627 --> 42:28.539
Apparently, he's considered
the black sheep of the family.

42:28.713 --> 42:30.920

42:36.012 --> 42:39.004
Tommy took her new last name
to piss him off.

42:39.182 --> 42:43.175
Governor pretty much disowned him
after his recent incarceration.

42:43.353 --> 42:46.265
Tommy just got released
from rehab two days ago.

42:46.439 --> 42:49.931
Which is exactly
when the governor went missing.

You think Malloy's involved
in the governor's disappearance?

42:54.447 --> 42:58.281
Well, it's not a coincidence the governor's
grabbed the same day his kid's released.

Check with the rehab facility.
See who Tommy got chummy with.

43:04.916 --> 43:06.531
Maybe he got in deep
with someone he met there.
