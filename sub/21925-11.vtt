WEBVTT

00:12.011 --> 00:14.014
<i>Previously on </i>Star Trek: Discovery<i>:</i>

00:14.097 --> 00:17.267
-This is not our universe.
<i>We are in a parallel universe.</i>

00:17.350 --> 00:19.310
One governed by the Terran Empire.

00:19.394 --> 00:22.063
They're ruled by a faceless emperor
with absolute authority.

00:22.147 --> 00:25.191
<i>Most places and ships from our universe</i>
<i>exist here.</i>

00:25.275 --> 00:26.443
Same goes for people.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.611
We could meet another version
of ourselves?

00:28.695 --> 00:30.405
Stamets is nonresponsive.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.365
<i>No way he can get back into that cube.</i>

00:32.449 --> 00:36.494
He's contained for his own safety.
His adrenals are spiking uncontrollably.

00:36.703 --> 00:40.498
Speak your name.
-Voq, son of none.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.125
Closing in on the cockpit.

00:44.043 --> 00:46.921
It happened again, flashes of memory.
Worse this time.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.965
It appears the Klingons
have transformed you.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.383
-You're not you.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.263
We're not the first ship from our universe
to find ourselves here.

00:55.346 --> 00:58.975
<i>U.S.S. Defiant.</i> We find out how it did
make it over, could be our way home.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.228
<i>Captain Burnham will be returning</i>
<i>to the </i>Shenzhou<i> with me as bounty.</i>

01:03.188 --> 01:04.314
<i>Whatever you do...</i>

01:06.107 --> 01:07.984
...whatever this place makes you do...

01:09.277 --> 01:11.738
<i>whatever happens to you, or me...</i>

01:12.822 --> 01:15.450
however we change,
I am here to protect you.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.283
Harrington to engineering,

01:57.367 --> 02:00.453
I'm still working on
that electrical malfunction on deck 12.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.998
<i>Acknowledged. Deck 11,</i>
<i>section 6 is reporting the same problem.</i>

02:04.082 --> 02:06.626
-Think I've got that bulkhead operational.
<i>-Understood.</i>

02:06.709 --> 02:10.088
<i>Make sure manual controls are routed</i>
<i>to emergency operational systems.</i>

02:10.588 --> 02:12.507
The forest.
-Hold on a minute.

02:13.758 --> 02:14.968
The forest.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.429
The forest.

02:23.434 --> 02:24.602
The forest.

02:31.067 --> 02:35.864
The forest is dark,
but I can see him through the trees.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.366
The trees.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.453
The trees.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.165
The trees.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.726
<i>I can't rest here. Not really.</i>

03:08.813 --> 03:10.023
<i>My eyes open...</i>

03:10.607 --> 03:14.569
<i>and it's like waking</i>
<i>from the worst nightmare I could imagine.</i>

03:27.040 --> 03:28.291
<i>Even the light...</i>

03:28.875 --> 03:30.293
<i>is different.</i>

03:42.096 --> 03:44.098
<i>The cosmos has lost its brilliance.</i>

03:45.892 --> 03:47.393
<i>And everywhere I turn...</i>

03:48.645 --> 03:49.604
<i>there's fear.</i>

03:55.610 --> 03:56.486
Captain.

03:57.403 --> 04:00.323
I have come to perform
your daily ablutions.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.618
What is your name?

04:04.160 --> 04:06.329
A-- A slave has no name.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.251
<i>It's been two days.</i>

04:14.379 --> 04:16.422
<i>But they're already inside my head.</i>

04:19.550 --> 04:21.135
<i>Every moment is a test.</i>

04:36.484 --> 04:38.194
<i>Can you bury your heart?</i>

04:45.952 --> 04:47.745
<i>Can you hide your decency?</i>

04:54.168 --> 04:57.463
<i>Can you continue to pretend</i>
<i>to be one of them?</i>

04:59.924 --> 05:03.928
<i>Even as, little by little,</i>
<i>it kills the person you really are?</i>

05:16.274 --> 05:19.527
You're all guilty of malicious thoughts
against your emperor.

05:20.069 --> 05:24.490
By order of the sovereign Terran Empire,
I hereby sentence you to death.

05:26.617 --> 05:27.702
Energizing.

05:47.555 --> 05:50.975
<i>I've continued</i>
<i>to study their ways, read all that I can.</i>

05:53.352 --> 05:55.438
<i>It's getting easier to pass.</i>

05:58.274 --> 06:02.445
-Which is exactly what I feared the most.
You can never be one of them.

06:03.404 --> 06:04.655
We're all human here.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.659
We all start out with the same drives,
the same needs.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.580
Maybe none of us, no matter
what world we're from, really know...

06:13.331 --> 06:16.751
what darkness is waiting... inside.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.051
Thank you...

06:26.385 --> 06:27.386
for this.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.183
You remind me of everything good.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.562
Of what I want my world to look like.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.530
My first year at the academy,

06:46.280 --> 06:48.282
I was terrified of open space.

06:49.450 --> 06:53.121
I could fly anything, no sweat,
but I dreaded putting on that suit.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.499
Until I remembered the tether.

06:58.292 --> 07:01.629
They're mandatory the first few times
a cadet goes out in an EV and...

07:02.088 --> 07:05.591
they link you back to what you know,
what you love...

07:06.634 --> 07:09.387
help you stay strong,
even as you head out into that...

07:11.097 --> 07:12.348
terrifying abyss.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.269
And that's you.

07:18.563 --> 07:19.730
You're my tether.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.192
You bring me back.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.989
You did it before we were stranded,
and you're still doing it now.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.169
We're done here.

07:49.051 --> 07:50.303
Go check on my prisoner.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.107
This looks good, Saru.

08:05.693 --> 08:09.447
I'm gonna call you Saru,
in honor of a respected friend.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.116
Yes, Captain.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.791
<i>Incoming transmission</i>
<i>from the </i>I.S.S. Discovery<i>.</i>

08:20.875 --> 08:22.710
<i>Captain Tilly, Sylvia.</i>

08:32.887 --> 08:34.514
Computer, accept transmission.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.436
-Low band, zero traffic.

08:41.604 --> 08:42.688
I'm alone, Tilly.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.524
I have Mr. Saru.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.276
Hang in there, friend.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.619
Is your status unchanged?

08:56.702 --> 08:57.620
Yes, sir.

08:58.913 --> 09:03.042
I've accessed the classified files,
but the data's too massive to decipher.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.419
The Terran firewall is impenetrable.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.673
I'm unable to transmit intel off-ship
without being detected.

09:08.756 --> 09:12.176
An oppressive regime is, by nature,
a fearful regime.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.804
I'm afraid you must devise a workaround.

09:14.887 --> 09:18.766
The data concerning
the <i>U.S.S. Defiant's </i>entry into this realm

09:18.849 --> 09:22.979
is our last best hope at forming
our own plan of escape.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.690
So I take it Lieutenant Stamets' condition
hasn't improved?

09:25.773 --> 09:26.941
I'm afraid not. I will find a way.

09:32.071 --> 09:35.658
Oh, uh, one last question,
immaterial to the mission.

09:37.451 --> 09:40.746
My kind are few in our universe.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.456
I had hoped...

09:44.917 --> 09:47.628
Have you encountered any Kelpiens onboard?

09:49.839 --> 09:51.674
No, I haven't, Saru.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.221
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, not at all.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.223
It was merely a personal curiosity.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.310
Stay safe, Michael.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.061
And be wary.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.195
Culber was her friend and colleague.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.406
She deserves to know the truth.

10:16.365 --> 10:19.035
The news that we are dealing
with an intra-vessel homicide

10:19.118 --> 10:21.579
would distract Burnham
from her vital mission.

10:22.413 --> 10:25.291
The circumstances surrounding
Dr. Culber's death are...

10:25.374 --> 10:26.834
difficult to process.

10:26.917 --> 10:27.877
Even for me.

10:31.255 --> 10:32.840
I hate seeing him like this.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.975
If Stamets killed Culber,
he may be a danger to all of us.

10:43.059 --> 10:46.020
He only escaped because
the containment field was disabled.

10:46.103 --> 10:47.605
Culber probably lowered it.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.566
Who could stand to see
the person they love in a cage?

10:50.650 --> 10:54.070
-Perhaps that was his fatal error.
-Stamets didn't kill anyone.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.573
Are you suggesting there's a murderer
running free on our ship?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.158
No, I'm saying that this...

10:59.492 --> 11:00.868
This is not Paul Stamets.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.168
I've analyzed scans
of his neurological function.

11:09.669 --> 11:14.006
Hyperactivity of white matter in his brain
has increased at an alarming rate.

11:14.382 --> 11:18.094
Redirected blood flow almost exclusively
to the frontopolar cortex.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.263
Rendering all other segments
of the brain essentially nonfunctional.

11:21.347 --> 11:25.017
This wasn't a murder.
This was an unfortunate consequence

11:25.101 --> 11:28.604
of an addled mind trying to reach beyond
a cloud of confusion.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.899
We are losing him, Commander, and fast.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.486
The lieutenant's health is in the hands
of our medical officers.

11:35.569 --> 11:39.031
Medicine isn't working.
This is a spore issue.

11:39.448 --> 11:42.701
Which means no one is more qualified
to treat him than I am.

11:45.496 --> 11:46.497
Please?

11:47.665 --> 11:49.166
Let me bring him back.

12:11.063 --> 12:15.151
Incoming hail. Captain Maddox of
the <i>Imperial Flagship </i>seeks an audience.

12:15.901 --> 12:16.944
Acknowledge.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.198
Michael Burnham in the flesh.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.493
Then it's true.
The emperor will be pleased.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.079
Not as pleased as I am
to have reclaimed what's mine.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.372
I'm sure.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.915
The emperor has a mission.

12:30.749 --> 12:34.295
-Your first dip back into the fray.
-I'm up for the challenge.

12:34.378 --> 12:37.506
Imperial intelligence has uncovered
the location of the Fire Wolf.

12:38.215 --> 12:40.134
The Klingon leader of the resistance.

12:40.217 --> 12:44.305
Who's marching witless alien insurgents
to their inevitable deaths.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.601
His base is on Harlak.
I'm sending you the coordinates now.

12:49.143 --> 12:52.188
-Your mission is simple--
-Terran General Order Four:

12:52.271 --> 12:55.649
"Any exotic species deemed a threat
to the Imperial Supremacy

12:55.733 --> 13:00.821
-will be extinguished without prejudice."
-Kill them all. The emperor commands it.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.913
Tactical, prep photon torpedoes
for launch--

13:08.996 --> 13:11.248
Do not anticipate me, Number One.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.876
-Captain, we have our orders--
-No.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.294
I have <i>my </i>orders.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.383
You've all grown soft in my absence.

13:22.551 --> 13:26.680
You think it was easy tracking Lorca,
bringing him back here alive?

13:27.765 --> 13:30.226
We could kill the Fire Wolf
and his followers,

13:30.309 --> 13:32.728
and lay waste to their operation
from above.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.397
Or we could get our hands dirty.

13:38.025 --> 13:41.195
Prep a landing party.
I'll infiltrate the rebel base myself.

13:44.114 --> 13:48.327
And return with the intel we need
to bury the resistance once and for all.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.650
You have to do it.

15:43.692 --> 15:46.445
Give the order. You have to wipe them out.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.824
But I can't send hundreds of rebels
to their death to save myself.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.494
What about your crew

15:53.953 --> 15:56.622
Our universe. Be a massacre by Klingons.

15:57.373 --> 16:02.670
Sometimes the end justifies...
terrible means.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.380
Permission to speak freely, sir?

16:06.006 --> 16:09.551
I fear that your suffering
has influenced your judgment.

16:12.012 --> 16:16.100
I will find a way to get what we need
to <i>Discovery.</i>

16:17.226 --> 16:20.437
But in the meantime,
lives are hanging on my command...

16:21.271 --> 16:22.523
here and at home.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.527
And this rebellion against the Terrans...

16:27.319 --> 16:29.947
it's an unshakeable union of species.

16:30.614 --> 16:33.367
Klingons, Vulcans, Andorians, Tellarites.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.203
It's the closest to a Federation
this universe may see.

16:36.286 --> 16:40.040
-That a Klingon leads the alliance.

16:41.834 --> 16:42.793
A Klingon.

16:44.294 --> 16:45.504
They rally behind him.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.382
If we can walk away from this

16:48.465 --> 16:52.261
with the means to successfully negotiate
with the Klingon race...

16:53.470 --> 16:55.806
that's real hope for finding peace
at home.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.142
Please, sir.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.979
I no longer have my pips,
but I'm still Starfleet.

17:04.023 --> 17:07.818
Don't force me to slaughter
this coalition of hope.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.655
Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm not...

17:12.865 --> 17:14.283
seeing things clearly.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.369
All right, no landing party.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.998
You insist that you and Tyler
beam down alone.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.710
I can't risk your true agenda
being exposed.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.172
Hurry back, please.

17:31.842 --> 17:35.429
<i>Navigation tech,</i>
<i>report to the shuttlebay for maintenance.</i>

17:35.971 --> 17:37.514
He called me "Captain."

17:39.641 --> 17:41.560
I didn't think much of it at first.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.563
Save that it had
a pretty sweet ring to it.

17:45.022 --> 17:48.067
Then we came here to this universe,
where I am captain.

17:49.109 --> 17:53.113
You hypothesized
that Mr. Stamets began receiving glimpses

17:53.197 --> 17:55.074
of this alternate plane

17:55.157 --> 17:58.827
-that preceded our physical arrival.
-Yes. Um...

17:58.911 --> 18:04.374
This... scan represents the tardigrade's
neural activity when he first came to us.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.459
Do you see this?

18:05.542 --> 18:08.587
Micro patterns in the frontopolar cortex.

18:08.962 --> 18:13.133
Some sort of undetermined
and seemingly ancillary activity.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.844
Neurons firing nowhere,
or so we thought at the time.

18:18.222 --> 18:22.142
This is Stamets today. Micro patterns
are a symptom of mycelial travel,

18:22.226 --> 18:25.562
but what we hadn't considered then
was that they could also be

18:25.646 --> 18:26.814
a neuronal link.

18:26.897 --> 18:30.984
A kind of internal transdimensional portal
to this universe.

18:31.068 --> 18:34.154
Or, theoretically,
any dimension accessible via the network.

18:34.738 --> 18:39.076
Now that segment of the brain is consuming
all of the organ's resources

18:39.159 --> 18:40.953
to keep the portal open.

18:41.036 --> 18:44.706
We need to restore function
to the entire brain. Like this.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.753
And what organism can symbiotically
contribute to the health of its host?

18:51.713 --> 18:52.548
Spores.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.011
Stamets is inside the network.

18:58.095 --> 19:02.850
In order to reclaim his neural function,
we need to put the network inside him.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.852
Proceed, cadet.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.169
Think about this.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.296
You're gonna get yourself killed.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.257
Better dead than one of them.

19:42.472 --> 19:43.724
Just follow my lead.

19:53.609 --> 19:54.776
Energize.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.460
The rebel encampment is...
500 meters from this point.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.297
Why can't we see anything?

20:17.883 --> 20:19.218
They don't want you to.

20:46.620 --> 20:50.457
No, no, no. To them, we're the enemy.
If we fire, it confirms that.

20:50.916 --> 20:54.711
-They have us pinned down.
-I have a plan. Hand me your phaser.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.270
I seek an audience
with the one you call the Fire Wolf.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.026
We come in peace.

21:18.694 --> 21:23.615
Against the orders of our emperor,
we come to deliver a message. A warning.

21:32.791 --> 21:33.625
With me.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.128
Active camouflage.

22:19.087 --> 22:22.090
This is how the Fire Wolf kept
the base secret for nearly two years.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.616
You're the Fire Wolf.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.326
We finally meet.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.328
I am Voq.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.121
Son of none.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.791
My spies told me you were dead.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.127
I must admit, we rejoiced at this news.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.962
The old Michael Burnham is dead.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.009
I'm the new Michael Burnham.

23:06.843 --> 23:08.553
One who's betraying her kind.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.098
Risking her life to save you.

23:11.181 --> 23:12.849
The new Michael Burnham.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.143
Are you not
the Butcher of the Binary Stars?

23:15.227 --> 23:18.063
-There are two sides to every battle.
With a single savage order,

23:18.146 --> 23:21.233
you executed thousands of my kind,
establishing yourself

23:21.316 --> 23:24.069
as the figurehead of Terran cruelty.
Do you deny those actions?

23:24.152 --> 23:24.986
I cannot.

23:26.196 --> 23:29.908
-But it is not who I want to be anymore.
-Then I am happy to relieve you--

23:29.991 --> 23:32.452
-I understand your urge to fight.

23:32.577 --> 23:36.540
The only way that you can see me,
determine my true intentions.

23:38.416 --> 23:40.001
But I do swear to you,

23:40.460 --> 23:44.256
every moment that we square off
wastes precious time.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.800
The emperor has discovered your location.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.595
I had orders to enter Harlak's orbit
and destroy your base.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.266
Try it.
The resistance will fight to the death.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.976
I think we can help each other.

24:00.438 --> 24:03.567
I want something from you.
In return, I will save your followers

24:03.650 --> 24:06.027
and ensure the longevity
of your resistance.

24:06.111 --> 24:09.114
Your emperor would never sanction
such an act of mercy.

24:09.197 --> 24:11.867
No. But my emperor will be satisfied

24:11.950 --> 24:14.369
when I strafe Harlak
with photon torpedoes...

24:14.953 --> 24:18.081
following the safe evacuation
of your people.

24:21.293 --> 24:25.672
I cannot place their lives in human hands.
Not without absolute certainty.

24:27.591 --> 24:28.842
Bring out the Prophet.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.267
Master Sarek sees all.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.394
His wisdom pierces minds.

24:39.936 --> 24:43.315
If you truly come in peace,
he will find it in your heart.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.168
My mind to your mind.

25:04.002 --> 25:06.046
My thoughts to your thoughts.

25:12.093 --> 25:13.678
My mind to your mind.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.514
My thoughts to your thoughts.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.981
You've proven that you're
as accomplished as any Vulcan,

25:25.065 --> 25:29.444
which is gonna serve you well.
As long as you never forget...

25:30.111 --> 25:31.363
that you're human, too.

25:32.405 --> 25:34.199
To the charge of mutiny,

25:34.699 --> 25:36.826
-Guilty.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.708
Sarek.

25:44.793 --> 25:47.921
-I see a world...

25:50.173 --> 25:54.636
bursting with potential,
a child molded by wisdom,

25:54.719 --> 26:00.308
and a seemingly impossible depth
of human compassion.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.730
She means us no harm.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.451
If the Prophet deems your motives
to be pure,

26:19.411 --> 26:21.955
then even I am not headstrong enough
to argue.

26:23.290 --> 26:26.918
Prepare to evacuate.
Leave no trace for prying Terran eyes.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.629
Wait. I told you,
I wanted something in return.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.256
You have earned that right.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.844
You lead this group
of vastly different species.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.345
A Klingon,

26:37.929 --> 26:41.766
whose pride of honor is eternally fused
with his identity as a warrior,

26:41.850 --> 26:44.019
stands side by side with a Vulcan,

26:45.270 --> 26:49.566
who cannot possibly comprehend his need
for aggressive emotional expression. And a willful Andorian looks to you
not with hostility, but with allegiance.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.200
I need to know how.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.620
How have you come to compromise
and embrace each other?

27:06.624 --> 27:09.294
The light of Kahless guides me
in all things.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.670
<i>Kahless.</i>

27:10.754 --> 27:13.340
Together under one creed.

27:13.423 --> 27:16.885
But the light of Kahless
demands that you honor your race.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.554
Yet here you are speaking
in a foreign language.

27:19.637 --> 27:22.265
Placing your faith in the cultural customs
of others.

27:22.349 --> 27:26.186
I am here. I have survived only
on the shoulders of my comrades.

27:26.269 --> 27:29.022
Our purity is a threat to them.

27:29.105 --> 27:32.776
<i>They wish to drag us into the muck,</i>
<i>where humans,</i>

27:32.859 --> 27:34.903
Vulcans,

27:34.986 --> 27:36.529
<i>Tellarites,</i>

27:36.613 --> 27:39.866
and filthy Andorians mix.

27:40.575 --> 27:42.744
The humans seek Klingon extinction.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.622
They have denied us our rituals,
our language.

27:45.705 --> 27:46.873
That is why I fight.

27:46.956 --> 27:49.793
The Terrans will not stop
until all of their enemies are destroyed.

27:49.876 --> 27:52.003
A Terran enemy is a Klingon friend.  So you are united
by the common adversary,

27:54.714 --> 27:57.092
but does that union not contradict

27:57.175 --> 28:01.388
your drive to defend the Klingon honor
at all costs?

28:01.471 --> 28:03.181
Klingons stand together, and strong.

28:03.765 --> 28:07.060
It is only with our own houses in order
that we can begin to invite others in.

28:07.143 --> 28:08.978
My house is bonded

28:09.562 --> 28:10.939
<i>by a single doctrine:</i>

28:11.022 --> 28:13.525
Remain Klingon.

28:13.858 --> 28:16.111
Remain Klingon or die!

28:16.694 --> 28:18.071
Tyler, no!

28:20.782 --> 28:22.242
Tyler, stop!

28:25.829 --> 28:28.665
Who are you?
How do you speak our forgotten tongue?

28:34.629 --> 28:35.755
No. No.

28:47.350 --> 28:50.895
So the darkness of a Terran soul
can now suppress a Vulcan mind

28:50.979 --> 28:54.274
No. My guard has attacked you
against my orders.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.485
-You dishonor yourselves, even in death.
Wait.

28:58.653 --> 29:00.905
I told you Captain Burnham
meant us no harm.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.866
I stand by that assessment.

29:02.949 --> 29:05.994
Impossible. Her man tried
to assassinate the Fire Wolf.

29:06.077 --> 29:11.583
I do not claim to understand his motives,
but hers are pure.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.169
She is an outsider.

29:15.378 --> 29:16.629
Like us, she...

29:17.964 --> 29:19.632
seeks escape from this world.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.427
To reclaim hope.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.096
Equality, peace.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.309
It is only in sparing her life

29:29.851 --> 29:33.313
that we, too, will see the fight
of another day.

29:35.148 --> 29:36.900
Tell me what needs to be done.

29:37.650 --> 29:38.735
Then be gone.

29:38.818 --> 29:43.072
You have one hour to flee with your lives.
My ship waits in Harlak's orbit.

29:43.156 --> 29:45.700
But I do need to prove
that my mission here was successful.

29:48.787 --> 29:49.621
Shukar.

30:01.341 --> 30:04.886
The location of each of the rebel
listening stations within this quadrant.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.971
By the time your crew have deciphered
our code,

30:07.055 --> 30:09.015
we will have rendered
the intel inactionable.

30:30.662 --> 30:31.621
Thank you...

30:32.247 --> 30:33.665
for your wisdom.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.918
I will thank you
only after we reach safety.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.599
Burnham to <i>Shenzhou. </i>Two to transport.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.195
Have it analyzed.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.532
It contains data to bring the rebellion
to its knees.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.910
Tell tactical to prep those torpedoes.

31:11.786 --> 31:14.789
But I'll give the order to fire weapons
at my discretion.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.374
My apologies, Captain.

31:16.457 --> 31:17.876
I'll be in quarters.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.252
Tyler, you're with me.

31:25.425 --> 31:28.428
The laser photon emissions
are comprised entirely

31:28.511 --> 31:31.055
of exotic matter found
in the mycelial plane.

31:31.139 --> 31:35.018
And when that matter integrates
with Stamets' own neural materials,

31:35.101 --> 31:37.020
it should restore his cognitive function.

31:37.896 --> 31:41.024
A scientist saved by his own specimens.

31:42.191 --> 31:45.111
The veins and muscles of the universe.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.405
Fungi are the only organism

31:47.488 --> 31:50.533
with the biological aptitude
to link death with life.

31:53.661 --> 31:58.249
-His heart rate is accelerating.
-That is, uh, an expected side effect.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.668
That big brain of his is doing
some heavy lifting.

32:02.462 --> 32:06.549
Okay, there. The neural patterns in the
temporal lobe are returning to baseline.

32:06.633 --> 32:07.508
It's...

32:08.217 --> 32:09.302
It's working.

32:09.385 --> 32:10.511
Remarkable.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.389
Your comprehension...

32:14.182 --> 32:16.434
of the astromycology

32:16.851 --> 32:19.854
behind Mr. Stamets' findings is...

32:20.271 --> 32:22.315
Well, I'm impressed.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.236
Enough that you'll recommend me
for the command training program?

32:29.197 --> 32:31.824
Enough that if we ever find our way
back to a universe that has a command training program,

32:35.411 --> 32:36.579
I will consider it.

32:42.085 --> 32:44.712
Heart rate is dropping.
He can't sustain this level of exertion.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.881
We're nearly there. Come on, Stamets.

32:52.178 --> 32:55.807
Redirecting the brain's resources has
affected the autonomic nervous system.

32:59.102 --> 33:02.355
This is your captain. We need emergency
medical assistance in engineering.

33:02.438 --> 33:05.149
No, no, no. I'm administering something
to restart his heart.

33:05.233 --> 33:08.695
If we disengage him from the network now,
we will lose him altogether.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.700
We already have.

33:13.783 --> 33:14.909
Please stand back.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.328
Please, Saru. Order them to stand down.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.625
Computer, emergency reaction cube access.

33:22.709 --> 33:24.210
<i>Access granted.</i>

33:29.632 --> 33:31.342
Clear.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.264
-Again.

33:41.602 --> 33:42.437
And again.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.665
Tell me the truth.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.419
Right now. What is happening to you?

34:06.502 --> 34:08.713
Michael, please.
-I have had your back.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.840
I've saved your life.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.468
I've loved you.

34:14.135 --> 34:17.472
You didn't just jeopardize me,
you jeopardized our mission.

34:18.723 --> 34:22.852
-Our entire crew back on <i>Discovery</i>.
-The captain warned us we'd do things

34:22.935 --> 34:25.897
-out of our nature to survive.
-No! We were surviving.

34:25.980 --> 34:28.441
It was under control.
And this erratic behavior,

34:29.275 --> 34:31.069
it's not because of this new universe.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.654
-I saw it onboard the Klingon flagship.
-Stop.

34:33.738 --> 34:35.948
-Please, stop.
-In the worker bee,

34:36.032 --> 34:39.118
when you could barely complete
a simple mission.

34:39.786 --> 34:41.412
You said I was your tether.

34:43.498 --> 34:44.791
Ash, I need one, too.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.503
What are you hiding from me?

34:56.928 --> 34:59.722
I feel something for her. L'Rell.

35:00.932 --> 35:01.891
A reverence.

35:02.475 --> 35:03.518
An allegiance.

35:04.143 --> 35:05.269
Maybe an affection.

35:06.104 --> 35:09.440
And when she speaks, I'm forced to listen.
And her words...

35:10.525 --> 35:11.651
they tell me who I am.

35:16.656 --> 35:18.407
Whom do we seek?

35:20.576 --> 35:21.661
Kahless.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.996
She brainwashed you.

35:24.413 --> 35:26.707
-She wanted a spy aboard <i>Discovery.</i>
No.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.334
More than just mind games.

35:28.417 --> 35:29.502
More than torture!

35:33.631 --> 35:37.218
<i>There are masses of scar tissue</i>
<i>surrounding all of your organs.</i>

35:37.301 --> 35:41.180
They opened up your limbs.
As far as I'm concerned, you're not you.

36:04.579 --> 36:06.914
<i>They reduced a Klingon body...</i>

36:06.998 --> 36:08.166
<i>...to human.</i>

36:11.419 --> 36:12.420
I don't...

36:13.296 --> 36:15.339
I don't think I'm Ash Tyler,
Starfleet lieutenant.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.175
Not really. Not anymore.

36:17.258 --> 36:20.761
-You're not making sense.
-I feel him inside me.

36:21.429 --> 36:25.725
-His thoughts. His pain. His rage.
Who

36:25.808 --> 36:29.812
I tried to shut her out when L'Rell spoke
the call. I resisted by thinking of you.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.397
The one I wanna be human for.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.107
The one I love.

36:37.111 --> 36:38.154
I tried, Michael.

36:48.247 --> 36:49.373
But then I saw him.

36:50.708 --> 36:51.584
Face to face.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.086
Down on that planet.

36:56.005 --> 36:57.256
I couldn't fight it anymore.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.302
I remember now.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.554
I remember it all.

37:12.855 --> 37:14.815
We needed to infiltrate your ship.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.360
Learn your secrets.

37:18.861 --> 37:21.906
You were willing to betray your captain
to protect your people.

37:22.031 --> 37:24.909
I sacrificed my body and mind
to protect mine.

37:25.618 --> 37:29.080
I have the human's face,
but inside I remain Klingon.

37:29.956 --> 37:32.833
-I remain Voq.

37:33.376 --> 37:34.543
Son of none.

37:35.628 --> 37:36.629
The torchbearer.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.214
No.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.134
You're Ash Tyler.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.597
We're gonna get back to <i>Discovery...</i>

37:47.139 --> 37:49.100
and sit with Dr. Culber, and he's gonna--

37:49.183 --> 37:53.020
Dr. Culber saw past this body,
into the heart and mind of a warrior.

37:54.563 --> 37:56.357
Which is why I killed him.

38:00.069 --> 38:00.903
What?

38:02.196 --> 38:03.698
A necessary casualty.

38:04.573 --> 38:05.783
I need to contact Saru.

38:06.826 --> 38:08.286
I don't want to use this.

38:13.207 --> 38:14.041
I will.

38:26.595 --> 38:27.430
You.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.432
You killed my lord.

38:30.433 --> 38:31.684
Your lord?

38:32.018 --> 38:33.519
T'Kuvma was a beacon.

38:34.061 --> 38:35.646
A messiah to unite us.

38:36.647 --> 38:39.275
Deliver our race to dominance
over a submissive galaxy.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.573
I bet the humans hail your bravery.

38:47.616 --> 38:48.951
Did they praise you

38:49.660 --> 38:51.203
after you martyred his name?

38:51.954 --> 38:53.289
You've lost your mind.

39:01.797 --> 39:03.257
You fought like a coward.

39:03.966 --> 39:05.384
Scratched at my eyes.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.596
But you could not blind me to the truth.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.059
I didn't testify to that.

39:15.895 --> 39:16.896
It's you.

39:18.022 --> 39:18.981
You were there...

39:20.107 --> 39:21.192
on that bridge.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.319
I remember.

39:26.739 --> 39:28.616
I failed T'Kuvma that day.

39:33.996 --> 39:36.499
-I won't fail him again.

39:36.582 --> 39:38.876
I end you in T'Kuvma's name.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.051
He made an attempt on the captain's life.

39:48.969 --> 39:50.262
-Captain.
-I'm fine.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.245
Understood.
I'll alert the transporter room.

40:15.955 --> 40:19.458
Officer Tyler's swift execution will send
a valuable message to the crew.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.420
I know that you valued his service, but...

40:22.837 --> 40:24.338
Terran Law is binding.

40:24.880 --> 40:25.965
Of course.

40:27.758 --> 40:29.176
So ordered, Number One.

40:46.318 --> 40:47.653
I'm so sorry.

40:48.821 --> 40:50.406
I hope wherever you are...

40:51.991 --> 40:53.117
he's with you.

41:33.282 --> 41:35.326
Hello, Paul.
Ready to get to work?

41:35.409 --> 41:37.703
I so hoped you would find your way.

42:00.684 --> 42:03.812
Officer Ash Tyler,
you are guilty of the attempted murder

42:03.896 --> 42:05.689
of an Imperial Captain.

42:06.232 --> 42:10.653
By order of the sovereign Terran Empire,
I hereby sentence you to death.

42:12.738 --> 42:14.240
Your prisoner, Captain.

42:29.463 --> 42:30.923
You have anything to say?

42:35.719 --> 42:39.848
Kahless, give me light to see forever.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.321
Wait.

43:02.162 --> 43:03.872
This one dies by my own hand.

43:21.932 --> 43:24.018
Have Lorca delivered to my ready room.

43:24.310 --> 43:26.979
I'd like to soothe the blow
of Mr. Tyler's betrayal

43:27.646 --> 43:29.356
with a private interrogation.

44:03.349 --> 44:05.225
She should have let me die...

44:06.727 --> 44:08.479
-with honor.
-No.

44:09.438 --> 44:12.691
We are stranded in a cruel,
anarchic world,

44:13.108 --> 44:15.235
but we are still Starfleet.

44:15.778 --> 44:18.322
And we still live and die
by Federation law.

44:18.989 --> 44:21.575
No matter how heinous your crimes.

44:23.619 --> 44:24.620
And if she had,

44:26.288 --> 44:29.083
Burnham's mission aboard the <i>Shenzhou</i>
would remain incomplete.

44:31.585 --> 44:35.297
The Terran Empire's classified data
on the <i>U.S.S. Defiant.</i>

44:38.759 --> 44:40.511
Our key to finding a way home.

44:42.513 --> 44:46.016
Lieutenant Ash Tyler,
as acting captain of the <i>U.S.S. Discovery,</i>

44:46.100 --> 44:49.186
I hereby remand you to the brig
to await a tribunal.

45:05.244 --> 45:08.038
-We need to leave this place.
-Not yet.

45:10.707 --> 45:11.542
In time.

45:12.042 --> 45:13.710
But my mission was successful.

45:13.794 --> 45:17.131
And what if Commander Saru
can't isolate the data?

45:17.965 --> 45:20.676
What if the route <i>Defiant </i>took
is not available to us?

45:21.427 --> 45:25.931
Where would we run to if we were exposed
before the entire Terran fleet?

45:33.564 --> 45:36.150
Look, I know this is hard for you.

45:37.359 --> 45:38.360
I know you'd...

45:39.153 --> 45:40.279
come to care for...

45:41.613 --> 45:42.448
Tyler.

45:45.576 --> 45:47.578
I don't think I can
survive this place alone.

45:47.953 --> 45:49.496
You're not alone, Michael.

45:52.166 --> 45:55.919
We will survive this place... together.

45:58.422 --> 46:01.133
<i>Captain, we're detecting</i>
<i>a power signature within orbit.</i>

46:01.216 --> 46:03.677
<i>It seems another vessel</i>
<i>is targeting Harlak.</i>

46:04.219 --> 46:06.221
The rebels haven't completed
their evacuation.

46:10.100 --> 46:11.768
-Grab Lorca.
Aye, Captain.

46:13.854 --> 46:15.022
Who is it?

46:15.772 --> 46:17.191
Why can't we see them?

46:17.274 --> 46:19.735
Hail the commanding officer.
Tell them to retreat.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.445
Now!

46:37.127 --> 46:38.837
All decks, brace for impact.

46:42.508 --> 46:45.385
Impulse drive is showing
intermittent shorts.

46:45.469 --> 46:48.096
Incoming transmission.
It's the emperor.

46:58.106 --> 46:59.733
Captain Michael Burnham. You've been away too long.

47:03.612 --> 47:06.198
Though I can't say the same
for your prisoner.

47:07.407 --> 47:11.453
I do not appreciate having to warp my way
across the quadrant

47:11.537 --> 47:14.623
to clean up your untended mess.

47:15.582 --> 47:16.875
When I give an order,

47:17.501 --> 47:20.128
I do not expect to be ignored.

47:22.631 --> 47:25.050
Don't you bow before your emperor?
