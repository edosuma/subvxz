WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.938
(sultry electronica playing)

00:12.413 --> 00:13.381
>> JIMMY: What?

00:13.414 --> 00:14.382
>> GRETCHEN: You're losing your

00:14.415 --> 00:15.216
hair.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.217
>> JIMMY: What? Why would you

00:16.250 --> 00:17.085
say that to me?

00:17.118 --> 00:18.052
>> GRETCHEN: I'm practicing.

00:18.086 --> 00:18.886
>> JIMMY: Practicing what?

00:18.919 --> 00:19.720
Dying alone?

00:19.753 --> 00:20.554
>> GRETCHEN: Being honest.

00:20.588 --> 00:21.389
>> JIMMY: Well, go and do it

00:21.422 --> 00:22.223
somewhere else.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.224
>> GRETCHEN: You're always so

00:23.257 --> 00:24.658
honest-- I admire that.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.659
I'm a giant liar.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.494
Always have been.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.328
>> JIMMY: Always?

00:27.361 --> 00:28.196
>> GRETCHEN: I told the Spice

00:28.229 --> 00:29.029
Girls I was dying of brain

00:29.063 --> 00:29.863
cancer in order to get free

00:29.897 --> 00:30.864
concert tickets.

00:30.898 --> 00:31.865
>> JIMMY: Dishonesty to spare

00:31.899 --> 00:33.101
someone's feelings belittles

00:33.134 --> 00:34.535
everyone involved.

00:34.568 --> 00:35.836
Dishonesty to get free stuff is

00:35.869 --> 00:37.405
just smart economics.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.340
>> GRETCHEN: Thanks.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.941
Oh. No.

00:40.974 --> 00:41.942
No, no.

00:41.975 --> 00:42.943
>> JIMMY: Why not?

00:42.976 --> 00:44.011
>> GRETCHEN: I'm gonna get latex

00:44.044 --> 00:45.012
poisoning.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.013
>> JIMMY: Well, you can't leave

00:46.046 --> 00:47.014
me like this.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.182
I'll be really quick-- you won't

00:48.216 --> 00:49.183
even notice.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.184
>> GRETCHEN: Nice try.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.285
I learned blue balls were a myth

00:51.319 --> 00:52.453
when I was 12.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.721
>> JIMMY: The boy that told you

00:53.754 --> 00:57.225
that is a traitor to our gender!

00:57.258 --> 00:59.593
(water running)

01:02.796 --> 01:05.299
(grunts)

01:05.333 --> 01:08.936
(exhales)

01:08.969 --> 01:10.604
>> GRETCHEN: Wow.

01:10.638 --> 01:11.639
Look at you.

01:11.672 --> 01:12.806
You're like an animal.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.742
Like some albino gorilla.

01:14.775 --> 01:15.776
>> JIMMY: It's your fault, baby.

01:15.809 --> 01:16.644
Walking around with that ass.

01:16.677 --> 01:17.578
>> GRETCHEN: You know, erections

01:17.611 --> 01:18.412
can be wasted.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.247
You will get another one.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.114
>> JIMMY: But I like this one.

01:20.148 --> 01:20.981
>> GRETCHEN: And I thought all

01:21.014 --> 01:21.815
Englishmen were sexually

01:21.849 --> 01:22.650
repressed.

01:22.683 --> 01:23.651
>> JIMMY: No, you're thinking of

01:23.684 --> 01:24.485
the Welsh.

01:24.518 --> 01:25.453
So you're just gonna watch me

01:25.486 --> 01:26.287
then?

01:26.320 --> 01:27.288
>> GRETCHEN: I literally can't

01:27.321 --> 01:28.122
look away.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.123
>> JIMMY: You're not gonna ruin

01:29.157 --> 01:29.957
this for me.

01:29.990 --> 01:30.791
>> GRETCHEN: Okay.

01:30.824 --> 01:31.792
>> JIMMY: Doesn't bother me one

01:31.825 --> 01:32.626
bit.

01:32.660 --> 01:33.461
>> GRETCHEN: Good.

01:33.494 --> 01:34.462
>> JIMMY: This is gonna happen.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.830
>> GRETCHEN: Glad to hear it.

01:42.703 --> 01:43.671
>> JIMMY: Damn it!

01:43.704 --> 01:44.672
>> GRETCHEN: Ha! I win.

01:44.705 --> 01:45.673
Well, anyway, I just started my

01:45.706 --> 01:46.674
period two days early.

01:46.707 --> 01:47.675
>> JIMMY: Oh.

01:47.708 --> 01:48.676
>> GRETCHEN: It's your fault,

01:48.709 --> 01:49.677
buddy.

01:49.710 --> 01:50.678
You're the one who smacked the

01:50.711 --> 01:51.679
side of the ketchup bottle over

01:51.712 --> 01:52.680
and over.

01:52.713 --> 01:53.814
>> JIMMY: Okay, well, so I'll

01:53.847 --> 01:56.150
see you in five days or so.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.785
What?

01:57.818 --> 01:58.819
>> GRETCHEN: Seriously?

01:58.852 --> 02:00.288
>> JIMMY: What, do yours last

02:00.321 --> 02:01.289
longer or...

02:01.322 --> 02:02.356
>> GRETCHEN: Forget it.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.357
Don't worry.

02:03.391 --> 02:04.358
I'll leave the village till my

02:04.392 --> 02:05.626
moon is over.

02:05.659 --> 02:06.627
>> JIMMY: Well, I could always

02:06.660 --> 02:08.962
play through, as they say.

02:08.996 --> 02:10.198
>> GRETCHEN: Stop.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.633
See you in five days.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.641
(grunts)

02:25.413 --> 02:28.148
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:28.182 --> 02:30.818
I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:30.851 --> 02:34.555
I'm gonna leave you anyway. *

02:37.858 --> 02:40.661
(sniffs)

02:40.694 --> 02:42.630
>> JIMMY: Ferris Bueller.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.631
Awesome.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.632
What channel is it on?

02:44.665 --> 02:45.633
>> EDGAR: It's not.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.867
I rented it.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.135
>> JIMMY: You rented it?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.703
Are you a timecop sent from the

02:49.737 --> 02:51.805
past to kill me?

02:51.839 --> 02:54.375
You rented a DVD?

02:54.408 --> 02:55.509
I literally don't know where one

02:55.543 --> 02:56.577
can do that anymore.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.578
>> EDGAR: Well, I noticed it was

02:57.611 --> 02:58.579
playing at the revival house

02:58.612 --> 02:59.580
this week, and I realized I

02:59.613 --> 03:01.014
hadn't seen it in a while but I

03:01.048 --> 03:02.483
didn't want to risk going in

03:02.516 --> 03:03.484
because of what happened during

03:03.517 --> 03:04.485
Captain Phillips.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.486
>> JIMMY: This movie has one of

03:05.519 --> 03:06.487
the greatest villains of all

03:06.520 --> 03:07.488
time.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.489
>> EDGAR: Yeah.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.090
Principal Rooney is so mean.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.091
>> JIMMY: Rooney?

03:11.124 --> 03:12.092
Rooney's not the villain.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.093
>> EDGAR: Oh, you mean the

03:13.126 --> 03:14.094
sister.

03:14.127 --> 03:15.195
That girl from the movie, um...

03:15.229 --> 03:16.196
>> JIMMY: Dirty Dancing.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.197
>> EDGAR: ...Wind.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.599
>> JIMMY: Right, first of all,

03:18.632 --> 03:20.000
Wind is what you retained from

03:20.033 --> 03:22.002
Jennifer Grey's career?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.003
And, no, she's not the villain

03:23.036 --> 03:24.004
either.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.005
>> EDGAR: Then who is?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.006
>> JIMMY: Cameron.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.007
>> EDGAR: Cam...

03:27.040 --> 03:28.676
No, Cameron's his best friend.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.677
Cameron's the sidekick.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.678
>> JIMMY: Edgar, I think I know

03:30.711 --> 03:32.079
a little something about

03:32.112 --> 03:33.847
Campbellian storytelling.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.048
Ferris is the hero.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.850
Jennifer Grey is the foil.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.586
Principal Rooney is the fool.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.788
Sloane is the sidekick.

03:40.821 --> 03:41.789
Cameron's the villain.

03:41.822 --> 03:42.790
>> EDGAR: Wait, how's Cameron

03:42.823 --> 03:44.124
the villain?

03:44.157 --> 03:45.293
>> JIMMY: Ferris just wants

03:45.326 --> 03:46.694
to show Cameron a fun day,

03:46.727 --> 03:47.928
right, for once in his pathetic

03:47.961 --> 03:50.698
little life, but Cameron acts

03:50.731 --> 03:52.733
like a whiny knob the whole

03:52.766 --> 03:55.102
time, subverting every attempt

03:55.135 --> 03:56.870
at fun with his

03:56.904 --> 03:59.072
passive-aggressive anxiety and

03:59.106 --> 04:00.874
relentless nay-saying,

04:00.908 --> 04:02.042
essentially ruining what might

04:02.075 --> 04:04.077
be Ferris' last day of freedom,

04:04.111 --> 04:05.646
by being a-a miserable,

04:05.679 --> 04:07.748
agoraphobic, cockblocking enemy

04:07.781 --> 04:09.383
of fun.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.618
>> EDGAR: Cameron's sick.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.152
He doesn't even want to go out.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.654
But Ferris guilts him into it

04:13.687 --> 04:15.656
and-and makes him steal his

04:15.689 --> 04:17.991
father's luxury automobile.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.293
>> JIMMY: Are we even watching

04:19.327 --> 04:21.228
the same movie?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.831
>> EDGAR: I think so.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.935
So, Gretchen left.

04:27.968 --> 04:28.936
You seeing her again tonight?

04:28.969 --> 04:29.937
>> JIMMY: No.

04:29.970 --> 04:30.938
>> EDGAR: Tomorrow?

04:30.971 --> 04:31.939
>> JIMMY: No.

04:31.972 --> 04:32.940
>> EDGAR: Oh, well.

04:32.973 --> 04:33.941
She lasted longer than most of

04:33.974 --> 04:34.942
'em.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.009
>> JIMMY: No, she's not done.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.145
She's... she's on her period.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.146
>> EDGAR: Oh, good call sending

04:39.179 --> 04:40.147
her away.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.248
I read an article about how the

04:41.281 --> 04:42.583
drought is pushing bears farther

04:42.616 --> 04:44.618
into town.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.320
It's nice that Gretchen's so

04:46.354 --> 04:48.456
cool about how you are.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.524
>> JIMMY: I'm sorry? How I am?

04:50.558 --> 04:51.525
>> EDGAR: Yeah.

04:51.559 --> 04:52.526
Most girls, they want more from

04:52.560 --> 04:53.627
a guy, but it's nice that this

04:53.661 --> 04:56.029
is all Gretchen wants.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.097
>> JIMMY: I don't... I don't

04:57.130 --> 04:58.131
know what Gretchen wants.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.132
>> EDGAR: Have you asked her?

04:59.166 --> 05:00.133
>> JIMMY: I'm trying to watch a

05:00.167 --> 05:01.201
movie and have a...

05:01.234 --> 05:02.470
What-what do you mean what she

05:02.503 --> 05:03.937
wants?

05:03.971 --> 05:05.839
This is... this is my brand-new

05:05.873 --> 05:08.676
"relationship" that I'm

05:08.709 --> 05:11.612
experiencing through me, okay?

05:11.645 --> 05:12.613
So it's not for me to worry

05:12.646 --> 05:14.181
about her.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.849
>> EDGAR: Or, you know...

05:15.883 --> 05:18.185
you could.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.319
>> JIMMY: You are such a

05:19.353 --> 05:21.722
Cameron!

05:24.925 --> 05:26.226
>> GRETCHEN: Mm, no.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.227
I'll try chocolate coconut

05:27.260 --> 05:28.462
truffle next.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.630
>> LINDSAY: Spiced chai.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.366
Three times in one afternoon?

05:32.400 --> 05:34.034
Ew, do you think he boned my

05:34.067 --> 05:35.302
sister that much?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.303
>> GRETCHEN: Can you imagine how

05:36.336 --> 05:37.638
pinchy her face must get?

05:37.671 --> 05:40.340
(high-pitched moaning)

05:40.374 --> 05:41.341
>> LINDSAY: Ew!

05:41.375 --> 05:42.342
That's my sister.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.343
I'm gonna vomit.

05:43.377 --> 05:44.344
>> GRETCHEN: Raspberry

05:44.378 --> 05:45.345
pomegranate tart.

05:45.379 --> 05:46.346
>> LINDSAY: Salted caramel

05:46.380 --> 05:47.347
pecan.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.348
Three times!

05:48.382 --> 05:49.583
Why don't we ever bone three

05:49.617 --> 05:50.818
times in one day?

05:50.851 --> 05:51.819
Where's he taken you?

05:51.852 --> 05:52.820
>> GRETCHEN: Black forest cake.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.821
>> LINDSAY: Peanut butter rum.

05:53.854 --> 05:54.822
>> GRETCHEN: We don't go

05:54.855 --> 05:55.823
anywhere.

05:55.856 --> 05:56.824
I told you, we're just having

05:56.857 --> 05:57.825
fun.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.826
>> LINDSAY: Be careful, Gretch.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.494
Jimmy is a soul vampire.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.862
And, face it, you don't always

06:01.895 --> 06:03.230
make the best choices.

06:03.263 --> 06:04.264
>> GRETCHEN: You're one to talk.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.666
>> LINDSAY: Ha. Mean.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.934
>> GRETCHEN: Kidding, Paul.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.268
>> WALLACE: So, what flavors

06:08.301 --> 06:09.269
have we settled on?

06:09.302 --> 06:10.270
>> GRETCHEN: Nothing for me.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.271
I'm too full.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.272
>> LINDSAY: Me, too.

06:12.305 --> 06:13.273
>> GRETCHEN: I got to go to

06:13.306 --> 06:14.274
work.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.275
See you soon.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.444
Stop worrying about me.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.445
>> LINDSAY: Never.

06:17.478 --> 06:18.546
As long as Jimmy's in this

06:18.579 --> 06:20.748
world.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.716
>> PAUL: Bye.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.619
You know, you're kind of mean to

06:25.653 --> 06:27.254
me when Gretchen's around.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.255
>> LINDSAY: How can you say

06:28.288 --> 06:29.256
that?

06:29.289 --> 06:31.091
Gretchen is lonely.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.693
We're so happy.

06:32.726 --> 06:36.063
I don't want to rub it in.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.698
>> PAUL: I love you.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.067
>> LINDSAY: I'm so lucky.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.943
*

06:57.618 --> 06:58.819
>> JIMMY: Good work.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.654
Now, um, go away.

07:00.688 --> 07:01.922
Picture books are over there,

07:01.955 --> 07:03.156
all right?

07:07.160 --> 07:09.129
(sputters)

07:11.364 --> 07:12.600
You can't read.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.602
(chuckles)

07:33.854 --> 07:36.023
>> MANAGER: Nice try, dickhole.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.190
How dare you try and take

07:37.224 --> 07:38.526
advantage of my new dumb-ass

07:38.559 --> 07:39.259
cashier.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.027
No offense, Philippe.

07:40.060 --> 07:40.994
>> JIMMY: You know, it is

07:41.028 --> 07:43.130
disgraceful that my bookstore

07:43.163 --> 07:44.498
won't support new writers.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.099
Especially a local one of some

07:46.133 --> 07:46.800
acclaim.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.301
>> MANAGER: Really? Where?

07:48.335 --> 07:50.037
Haven't seen you in a while.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.672
One explanation: you got some

07:51.705 --> 07:53.340
new slizz you've bamboozled into

07:53.373 --> 07:54.675
letting you throw your pasty

07:54.708 --> 07:55.442
junk into.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.777
>> JIMMY: No.

07:56.810 --> 07:57.678
She's not a slizz.

07:57.711 --> 07:58.612
>> MANAGER: Oh, what's her

07:58.646 --> 07:59.312
problem then?

07:59.346 --> 08:00.814
Humpback? Scientologist?

08:00.848 --> 08:01.882
Did she absorb her twin's

08:01.915 --> 08:02.583
fetus?

08:02.616 --> 08:03.884
>> JIMMY: Nothing. It's perfect.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.219
She comes over, we have fun.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.320
You must've come across that

08:07.354 --> 08:08.622
kind of happiness-- in a book,

08:08.656 --> 08:09.489
at some point.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.290
>> MANAGER: Wow.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.992
I knew you were a dipshit.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.994
I was just heretofore unaware of

08:14.027 --> 08:15.195
the true depths of your

08:15.228 --> 08:16.163
dipshittery.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.330
Look, take it from a woman...

08:17.364 --> 08:18.231
>> JIMMY: Really?

08:18.265 --> 08:19.332
Sorry, where?

08:19.366 --> 08:21.234
Look, I know how people date,

08:21.268 --> 08:22.069
okay?

08:22.102 --> 08:23.303
But we both agreed we don't want

08:23.336 --> 08:24.204
anything, 'cause we're

08:24.237 --> 08:24.838
different.

08:24.872 --> 08:25.873
>> MANAGER: Oh, okay.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.074
Well, keep going with that.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.676
See how long she sticks around.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.243
Hey, Philippe, from now on, you

08:30.277 --> 08:31.745
see this guy, you throw him out.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.080
And put his books back on the

08:33.113 --> 08:34.014
loser shelves.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.082
>> JIMMY: All right, bye.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.516
Oh, and good luck finding

08:36.550 --> 08:38.351
another job in six months when

08:38.385 --> 08:40.554
this place is a Yoshinoya Beef

08:40.588 --> 08:42.856
Bowl.

08:42.890 --> 08:43.857
>> MANAGER: I'm sorry if all

08:43.891 --> 08:44.858
that sexual tension made you

08:44.892 --> 08:46.860
uncomfortable.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.368
>> KILLIAN: Jimmy?

08:55.402 --> 08:56.670
Jimmy?

08:56.704 --> 08:57.504
>> GRETCHEN: All right, the

08:57.537 --> 08:58.438
official line is, "My account

08:58.471 --> 08:59.139
was hacked.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.407
I have no idea whose vagina that

09:00.440 --> 09:01.108
is."

09:01.141 --> 09:03.110
>> PEPPER: But it was my vagina.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.544
You can clearly see my

09:04.578 --> 09:05.512
micro-tattoo of the Nickelodeon

09:05.545 --> 09:06.213
logo.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.114
>> GRETCHEN: It doesn't matter,

09:07.147 --> 09:07.781
Pepper.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.049
A normal beaver shot is just a

09:09.082 --> 09:10.350
bad PR problem, but when a

09:10.383 --> 09:12.219
16-year-old tweets it, that's--

09:12.252 --> 09:13.253
repeat after me--

09:13.286 --> 09:14.354
child pornography.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.555
>> PEPPER: You're so

09:15.589 --> 09:16.957
controlling.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.592
You're like my dad and my

09:18.626 --> 09:20.560
step-mom and my manager, who's

09:20.594 --> 09:22.462
also my real mom, and my TV dad

09:22.495 --> 09:23.363
Mario Lopez...

09:23.396 --> 09:24.297
>> GRETCHEN: Sorry, babe.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.233
That's the law.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.367
>> PEPPER: What about my tits?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.301
>> GRETCHEN: Don't worry.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.737
We're going to roll out those

09:29.770 --> 09:32.305
tits in a controlled, legal

09:32.339 --> 09:33.941
environment-- like a very

09:33.974 --> 09:35.142
tasteful photo shoot with Terry

09:35.175 --> 09:35.976
Richardson.

09:36.009 --> 09:36.810
>> PEPPER: Really?

09:36.844 --> 09:38.311
>> GRETCHEN: No!

09:38.345 --> 09:40.814
Maybe.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.215
Hey, Edgar.

09:42.249 --> 09:42.883
What's up?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.317
>> EDGAR: Nothing. Oh, sorry.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.653
Um, I was just cleaning the

09:45.686 --> 09:47.655
house and I wanted to return

09:47.688 --> 09:49.489
these hair thingies.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.658
>> GRETCHEN: Thanks, but I have,

09:50.691 --> 09:51.759
like, a ton of these.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.827
And some of them are not mine.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.395
>> EDGAR: Oops. Sorry.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.264
Oh, yeah, uh, while I'm here,

09:57.297 --> 09:58.666
Jimmy wondered if you wanted to

09:58.699 --> 09:59.967
grab a bite to eat tonight.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.734
>> GRETCHEN: Tonight?

10:00.768 --> 10:02.335
Really?

10:02.369 --> 10:04.805
Okay, I'll come over after work.

10:04.838 --> 10:05.839
>> EDGAR: He'll meet you at the

10:05.873 --> 10:06.473
restaurant.

10:06.506 --> 10:07.607
I'll text you the address.

10:07.641 --> 10:08.676
>> GRETCHEN: Wait, why didn't he

10:08.709 --> 10:09.476
just ask me himself?

10:09.509 --> 10:10.410
>> EDGAR: Oh, he's slammed

10:10.443 --> 10:11.078
at work.

10:11.111 --> 10:11.979
>> GRETCHEN: What work?

10:12.012 --> 10:13.613
>> EDGAR: Okay. I should go.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.315
I have to try to find Killian.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.584
Oh, uh, and Gretchen...

10:17.617 --> 10:19.286
if you go hiking in the next few

10:19.319 --> 10:20.353
days, you're gonna want to

10:20.387 --> 10:22.355
attach, like, some bells around

10:22.389 --> 10:25.392
your neck or-or something.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.205
>> JIMMY: Excuse me.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.143
Uh, I didn't know what

10:43.176 --> 10:44.778
you liked, so I just got you one

10:44.812 --> 10:46.313
of their "mixology" things.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.280
>> GRETCHEN: What's the other

10:47.314 --> 10:47.881
one?

10:47.915 --> 10:49.116
>> JIMMY: Whiskey soda.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.084
Yeah.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.059
It's called a "reservation,"

10:59.092 --> 10:59.727
right?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.461
Not a "suggestion of eagerness

11:01.494 --> 11:03.196
to dine at a specific hour."

11:03.230 --> 11:05.165
>> GRETCHEN (laughs): Wouldn't

11:05.198 --> 11:06.399
fit on the Web site.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.401
(Jimmy laughs)

11:10.203 --> 11:12.372
>> JIMMY: They could at least

11:12.405 --> 11:13.841
give us chairs, so we don't have

11:13.874 --> 11:15.675
to crouch under this pipe.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.511
>> GRETCHEN: Ah, yeah.

11:18.545 --> 11:19.747
>> JIMMY: Oh, look, people are

11:19.780 --> 11:20.881
taking photos of their dinner.

11:20.914 --> 11:21.882
>> GRETCHEN: Are they afraid

11:21.915 --> 11:22.883
people won't believe they went

11:22.916 --> 11:23.516
to a restaurant?

11:23.550 --> 11:24.384
>> MAN: Hurry up, they're

11:24.417 --> 11:25.018
waiting for us.

11:25.052 --> 11:25.819
It's right over here.

11:25.853 --> 11:26.820
>> GRETCHEN: Excuse you!

11:26.854 --> 11:28.155
>> JIMMY: That is quite rude!

11:28.188 --> 11:29.322
>> MAN: Okay, whatever, man.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.591
Come on.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.160
(both chuckle)

11:33.193 --> 11:34.061
>> GRETCHEN: Should we just

11:34.094 --> 11:35.162
go or...?

11:35.195 --> 11:36.163
>> JIMMY: Oh. Well, I mean...

11:36.196 --> 11:38.365
>> HOSTESS: Follow me.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.399
>> JIMMY: Uh, great.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.401
Um, after you, uh...

11:50.610 --> 11:51.378
>> HOSTESS: Here we are.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.245
>> JIMMY: Sorry, what the hell

11:52.279 --> 11:53.046
is this?

11:53.080 --> 11:54.047
>> HOSTESS: This is our communal

11:54.081 --> 11:54.714
table.

11:54.748 --> 11:55.949
>> JIMMY: "Communal table."

11:55.983 --> 11:57.717
If we wanted to dine with total

11:57.751 --> 11:59.052
strangers, we would have taken

11:59.086 --> 12:00.620
an ad out on Craigslist.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.055
Or invited our parents over for

12:02.089 --> 12:04.024
dinner.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.025
>> HOSTESS: You're not dining

12:05.058 --> 12:05.793
with them.

12:05.826 --> 12:06.960
You're just dining at the same

12:06.994 --> 12:07.861
table as them.

12:07.895 --> 12:08.862
>> JIMMY: You're really cutting

12:08.896 --> 12:10.430
with a semantic Ginsu knife

12:10.463 --> 12:11.932
there, aren't you?

12:11.965 --> 12:12.900
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, man.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.902
I'm so hungry.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.444
>> JIMMY: $32 for pellizzoni?

12:24.477 --> 12:25.278
What is pellizzoni?

12:25.312 --> 12:26.279
>> GRETCHEN: It's a type of

12:26.313 --> 12:26.947
pasta.

12:26.980 --> 12:27.915
>> JIMMY: What is it made of?

12:27.948 --> 12:31.051
Bald eagle foreskin?

12:31.084 --> 12:32.419
Couldn't think of anything soft

12:32.452 --> 12:33.420
and expensive.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.621
>> OLD MAN: Bald eagles don't

12:34.654 --> 12:36.256
have penises, they have a

12:36.289 --> 12:37.757
cloaca.

12:37.791 --> 12:38.725
>> JIMMY: Thank you.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.592
>> WAITER: Good evening.

12:39.626 --> 12:40.727
Is this your first time at

12:40.760 --> 12:41.328
Insouciance?

12:41.361 --> 12:41.995
>> GRETCHEN: Yes.

12:42.029 --> 12:42.896
>> WAITER: Let me explain how

12:42.930 --> 12:43.596
our menu works.

12:43.630 --> 12:44.631
>> JIMMY: Why? Is it electronic?

12:44.664 --> 12:47.968
(old man laughs)

12:48.001 --> 12:49.136
You said you wanted to

12:49.169 --> 12:50.503
explain how the menu worked,

12:50.537 --> 12:51.905
which led me to the comic

12:51.939 --> 12:53.140
premise of taking your sentence

12:53.173 --> 12:55.075
at face value.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.110
Never mind. Go on.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.011
>> WAITER: Okay.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.146
Now, most of our dishes are

12:59.179 --> 13:00.147
meant to be shared, so we

13:00.180 --> 13:01.148
recommend three dishes

13:01.181 --> 13:02.415
from the top half and, depending

13:02.449 --> 13:03.750
on your appetite, two to three

13:03.783 --> 13:04.517
from the bottom.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.953
Can I start you off with bottled

13:05.986 --> 13:07.154
water or L.A.'s finest?

13:07.187 --> 13:07.787
>> JIMMY: Tap.

13:07.821 --> 13:08.488
>> GRETCHEN: Bottled.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.122
>> JIMMY: Bottled.

13:09.156 --> 13:09.990
>> GRETCHEN: Tap's fine.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.025
>> JIMMY: Just bring both.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.326
>> OLD MAN: You have to try the

13:13.360 --> 13:14.027
uni foam.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.662
>> JIMMY: I absolutely will not.

13:15.695 --> 13:16.629
Are people allowed to actually

13:16.663 --> 13:17.430
talk to other people?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.298
>> GRETCHEN: Seriously, we

13:18.331 --> 13:18.999
can go.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.000
>> JIMMY: No, we're doing this.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.434
>> GRETCHEN: Okay.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.036
Don't worry, I promise I won't

13:23.070 --> 13:23.937
order the pellizzoni.

13:23.971 --> 13:24.804
>> JIMMY: Oh, order whatever

13:24.838 --> 13:25.672
you like.

13:25.705 --> 13:26.840
Though you should probably have

13:26.874 --> 13:27.841
some iron, right?

13:27.875 --> 13:28.608
>> GRETCHEN: I knew it.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.442
Man!

13:29.476 --> 13:30.143
>> JIMMY: What?

13:30.177 --> 13:31.044
>> GRETCHEN: I knew I shouldn't

13:31.078 --> 13:31.778
have told you about...

13:31.811 --> 13:32.712
>> MAN: Hey, how's it going?

13:32.745 --> 13:34.681
>> WOMAN: Excuse us.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.816
>> JIMMY: Hello.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.185
>> GRETCHEN: Shouldn't have told

13:38.218 --> 13:40.687
you about the...

13:40.720 --> 13:42.956
Detroit Red Wings.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.692
How they're in town for a

13:45.725 --> 13:47.160
five-game series.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.395
>> JIMMY: I don't know anything

13:48.428 --> 13:49.029
about sports.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.030
You mean... do you mean your

13:50.063 --> 13:51.531
period?

13:51.564 --> 13:53.066
Wait, did I do something wrong?

13:53.100 --> 13:53.967
>> GRETCHEN: Yes!

13:54.001 --> 13:55.502
You were so weird about it.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.970
"See you in five days"?

13:57.004 --> 13:58.071
>> JIMMY: How is that weird?

13:58.105 --> 13:59.739
When your...

13:59.772 --> 14:02.542
the series is over and the Red

14:02.575 --> 14:03.743
Wings leave town to go and

14:03.776 --> 14:05.345
play more...

14:05.378 --> 14:06.513
>> GRETCHEN: Hockey.

14:06.546 --> 14:07.514
>> JIMMY: Hockey, elsewhere.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.515
The ice will be cleared to play

14:08.548 --> 14:09.716
on.

14:09.749 --> 14:10.918
>> GRETCHEN: That's not the

14:10.951 --> 14:12.152
point. That's a dick move.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.153
>> JIMMY: That's exactly the

14:13.186 --> 14:14.354
point.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.355
Look, if my favorite pinball

14:15.388 --> 14:16.523
game...

14:16.556 --> 14:17.524
>> GRETCHEN: Creature from the

14:17.557 --> 14:18.691
Black Lagoon in 3-D.

14:18.725 --> 14:19.692
>> JIMMY: Yes. If Creature from

14:19.726 --> 14:20.693
the Black Lagoon in 3-D is out

14:20.727 --> 14:21.861
of order, I'm going to wait to

14:21.895 --> 14:23.063
come back to the arcade when

14:23.096 --> 14:24.264
it's working again.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.498
>> GRETCHEN: There are other

14:25.532 --> 14:26.699
games!

14:26.733 --> 14:29.502
>> JIMMY: Do you mean your butt?

14:29.536 --> 14:32.372
>> GRETCHEN: Shit!

14:32.405 --> 14:34.407
>> JIMMY: Oh, goddamn it.

14:34.441 --> 14:35.575
Should we...?

14:35.608 --> 14:36.876
>> VERNON: Hey, hey!

14:36.910 --> 14:38.078
Jimmy.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.279
>> JIMMY: Hey!

14:39.312 --> 14:40.513
What the hell are you...?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.015
I'm surprised you're not on your

14:42.049 --> 14:43.216
honeymoon.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.417
>> BECCA: We go in a month.

14:44.451 --> 14:45.585
It's the busy time for Vernon.

14:45.618 --> 14:46.786
>> VERNON: Old bags always want

14:46.819 --> 14:48.021
to get their hips replaced at

14:48.055 --> 14:49.222
the same time.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.423
It's like, if one of them can

14:50.457 --> 14:51.591
walk normal, they all need to

14:51.624 --> 14:52.792
walk normal.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.027
>> BECCA: You're dining alone?

14:54.061 --> 14:55.295
>> JIMMY: No, I am with someone,

14:55.328 --> 14:56.863
but she's not feeling well.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.065
>> BECCA: Oh.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.232
>> VERNON: Sucks, man.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.700
Ditched at the commune tabes.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.402
>> BECCA: Well, enjoy your

15:02.435 --> 15:03.570
solitary dinner.

15:03.603 --> 15:04.771
Honey?

15:04.804 --> 15:05.973
>> VERNON: I'll be right there.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.407
Hey, wanted to say sorry about

15:07.440 --> 15:08.575
the ruckus at the wedding.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.776
Tensions were high.

15:09.809 --> 15:10.978
Mostly on account of Becca's mom

15:11.011 --> 15:12.212
being such a cooze.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.413
>> JIMMY: Oh, you were throwing

15:13.446 --> 15:14.581
your life away.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.782
You were stressed. I understand.

15:15.815 --> 15:16.984
>> VERNON: Word. Well, I should

15:17.017 --> 15:18.218
get back to Bec before the

15:18.251 --> 15:19.419
amuse-bouche drops.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.587
She's been known to take down

15:20.620 --> 15:21.788
hers and my bouche if I'm not

15:21.821 --> 15:22.990
quick enough.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.593
All right.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.804
>> EDGAR: There you are.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.006
I've been looking for you

15:39.039 --> 15:41.074
everywhere I could think of.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.842
Turns out, parents don't really

15:42.875 --> 15:44.444
appreciate a grown man driving

15:44.477 --> 15:45.945
slowly past playgrounds over and

15:45.979 --> 15:47.147
over.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.481
Don't you have a phone?

15:48.515 --> 15:49.649
>> KILLIAN: My parents are

15:49.682 --> 15:51.518
afraid I'll turn into a YouTube

15:51.551 --> 15:54.654
celebrity if I have one.

15:54.687 --> 15:58.425
(Edgar sighs)

15:58.458 --> 16:00.793
>> EDGAR: You okay?

16:00.827 --> 16:01.995
>> KILLIAN: Yeah.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.196
>> EDGAR: He didn't mean to

16:03.230 --> 16:05.365
forget you at the bookstore.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.700
It's just, sometimes people just

16:07.734 --> 16:08.968
have weird ways of being

16:09.002 --> 16:10.170
friends.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.371
>> KILLIAN: Yeah.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.605
>> EDGAR: In Iraq, we used to

16:12.639 --> 16:14.841
have this translator, Zaid.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.343
Oh, he was so funny.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.677
We used to teach him Eminem

16:17.710 --> 16:18.845
songs and make him do these

16:18.878 --> 16:20.047
lip-dubs, and then, we'd put

16:20.080 --> 16:22.449
them up on the Internet.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.616
I miss that guy.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.817
>> KILLIAN: What happened to

16:24.851 --> 16:26.019
him?

16:26.053 --> 16:27.220
>> EDGAR: The videos got so

16:27.254 --> 16:28.455
popular that the insurgents

16:28.488 --> 16:30.023
discovered he was working with

16:30.057 --> 16:31.224
the Americans, so they buried

16:31.258 --> 16:32.459
him alive in the desert, and

16:32.492 --> 16:33.626
they ran over his head with a

16:33.660 --> 16:36.463
tank.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.966
My point is, not all friends can

16:39.999 --> 16:42.635
be as awesome as Zaid.

16:42.669 --> 16:46.673
We just... have to appreciate

16:46.706 --> 16:48.075
the people who love us while

16:48.108 --> 16:50.843
they're still around.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.479
Hey, you want to go get some

16:52.512 --> 16:53.646
doner kebab?

16:53.680 --> 16:54.914
There's this awesome place on

16:54.947 --> 16:56.149
Hillhurst.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.417
>> KILLIAN: Does it have gluten?

16:57.450 --> 16:59.319
>> EDGAR: We can ask.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.255
Come on.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.624
>> KILLIAN: Bye, Debra.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.330
>> GRETCHEN: Psst.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.531
They didn't see me, did they?

17:11.564 --> 17:12.699
>> JIMMY: No.

17:12.732 --> 17:13.900
>> GRETCHEN: Ooh!

17:13.933 --> 17:15.102
That was close.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.336
>> JIMMY: I thought you were mad

17:16.369 --> 17:17.537
at me.

17:17.570 --> 17:18.705
>> GRETCHEN: Not compared to

17:18.738 --> 17:19.906
what a disaster it would have

17:19.939 --> 17:20.907
been if Becca and Vernon had

17:20.940 --> 17:22.109
seen us together.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.343
>> JIMMY: Oh, right.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.544
Well, then I'm mad at you.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.545
You just ditched me at the

17:25.578 --> 17:26.713
commune tabes.

17:26.746 --> 17:27.914
Vernon.

17:27.947 --> 17:29.116
>> GRETCHEN: Are you seriously

17:29.149 --> 17:30.350
ready to explain this-- whatever

17:30.383 --> 17:31.551
this is-- to anyone?

17:31.584 --> 17:32.719
Because I'm not.

17:32.752 --> 17:33.920
And I wouldn't have almost had

17:33.953 --> 17:35.122
to if you hadn't taken me on

17:35.155 --> 17:36.356
this ludicrous date.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.524
>> JIMMY: Well, I thought I

17:37.557 --> 17:38.691
should.

17:38.725 --> 17:39.692
You were so mad after the period

17:39.726 --> 17:40.893
thing.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.095
>> GRETCHEN: Well, yes, I didn't

17:42.129 --> 17:43.296
want you to automatically

17:43.330 --> 17:44.531
dismiss me as a goddamn viable

17:44.564 --> 17:45.698
human being to share air with

17:45.732 --> 17:46.899
the second I wasn't available

17:46.933 --> 17:48.801
for sex, but I'm not, like, mad,

17:48.835 --> 17:50.036
mad.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.238
I knew what I was getting with

17:51.271 --> 17:52.705
you, Jimmy.

17:52.739 --> 17:53.906
>> JIMMY: Okay, well... good.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.108
I'm glad you hate this place,

17:55.142 --> 17:56.309
too.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.544
It's the worst, right?

17:57.577 --> 17:58.711
>> GRETCHEN: No, dude.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.912
I've actually been here before.

17:59.946 --> 18:01.114
It's awesome.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.315
I love this fancy shit, just,

18:02.349 --> 18:03.550
you know, not with you.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.717
>> JIMMY: Ouch.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.620
>> GRETCHEN: I just meant not

18:07.654 --> 18:10.923
yet, or whatever.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.125
I told you up front.

18:12.159 --> 18:14.127
I'm... scared of this shit.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.129
>> JIMMY: Right.

18:16.163 --> 18:19.699
And I don't believe in it, so...

18:23.170 --> 18:25.238
I'm still hungry. You?

18:25.272 --> 18:28.508
>> GRETCHEN: I could eat.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.244
(indistinct chatter on screen)

18:31.278 --> 18:32.679
Ah.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.582
This was a great idea.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.417
God, I love this movie.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.918
>> JIMMY: It's the best.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.320
>> GRETCHEN: Ugh, I hate Cameron

18:40.353 --> 18:41.521
so much.

18:41.554 --> 18:42.755
>> JIMMY: He's repulsive.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.923
>> GRETCHEN: No kidding.

18:43.956 --> 18:47.627
It's, like, kill yourself.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.329
What?

18:49.362 --> 18:50.763
>> JIMMY: Nothing. Nothing.

18:50.797 --> 18:51.964
>> GRETCHEN: Did we get

18:51.998 --> 18:53.166
chopsticks?

18:53.200 --> 18:54.367
>> JIMMY: Yeah, I certainly

18:54.401 --> 18:55.602
asked for them.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.771
(paper bag rustling)

18:58.805 --> 18:59.939
Aha, there you go.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.140
>> WOMAN: Shh!

19:01.174 --> 19:02.342
>> GRETCHEN: You be quiet!

19:02.375 --> 19:03.543
Turn around and watch the movie!

19:03.576 --> 19:04.777
>> JIMMY: How dare you?!

19:04.811 --> 19:05.778
Just mind your own business, you

19:05.812 --> 19:06.979
old cow.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.181
>> GRETCHEN: Shh!

19:08.215 --> 19:09.382
God. Some people.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.617
>> JIMMY: Really.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.784
>> GRETCHEN: Right?

19:11.818 --> 19:12.985
>> JIMMY: Want a beer?

19:13.019 --> 19:15.388
>> GRETCHEN: Yup.

19:18.825 --> 19:22.395
>> JIMMY: Mm. This is good.

19:23.663 --> 19:27.033
(indistinct chatter)

19:31.103 --> 19:32.505
>> GRETCHEN: Excuse me.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.341
I have a large book club of

19:34.374 --> 19:36.309
ladies, and we're going to be

19:36.343 --> 19:37.677
reading a book, and drinking

19:37.710 --> 19:39.412
wine-- what-- and I just want to

19:39.446 --> 19:40.647
make sure you have enough

19:40.680 --> 19:41.848
copies?

19:41.881 --> 19:43.049
>> MANAGER: Fantastic.

19:43.082 --> 19:44.217
What is the title?

19:44.251 --> 19:45.418
>> GRETCHEN: Congratulations,

19:45.452 --> 19:47.687
You're Dying?

19:47.720 --> 19:51.090
By some guy with a weird name.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.325
Why aren't you typing?

19:52.359 --> 19:53.526
>> MANAGER: So, you're the

19:53.560 --> 19:54.727
slizz.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.364
>> GRETCHEN: What?

19:57.397 --> 19:59.766
>> JIMMY: Yeah?

19:59.799 --> 20:01.000
>> GRETCHEN: What a bitch.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.168
>> JIMMY: I knew it.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.370
She didn't buy it?

20:03.403 --> 20:04.571
>> GRETCHEN: No, so I stole

20:04.604 --> 20:05.772
this.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.507
>> JIMMY (laughing): Oh, sweet.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.542
I love this guy.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.344
I'm telling you, people that

20:11.378 --> 20:13.546
naturally suspicious of humanity

20:13.580 --> 20:14.747
should not be allowed to do

20:14.781 --> 20:15.948
customer service.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.116
>> GRETCHEN: No kidding.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.351
You think Killian wants a cat?

20:18.385 --> 20:22.789
>> JIMMY: Who?

20:22.822 --> 20:25.124
(manager whistles airily)

20:25.157 --> 20:26.125
>> MANAGER: Kerouac?

20:26.158 --> 20:28.127
Here, kitty, kitty.
