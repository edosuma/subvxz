IT WAS ALL IN MY HEAD.

21:37.879 --> 21:39.923
AND A LITTLE BIT IN MY THROAT.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.718
BUT THE FACT IS, THERE IS NO
ANIMAL, MINERAL, OR VEGETABLE

21:42.968 --> 21:45.595
{\an1}THAT CAN DEFEAT...
THE MIGHTY B.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.640
BUT YOU'RE TOTALLY
HUMILIATED, RIGHT?

21:48.890 --> 21:50.142
YOU'LL NEVER GO ON TV AGAIN?

21:50.392 --> 21:51.601
ARE YOU KIDDING?

21:51.852 --> 21:53.186
I'M LIBERATED.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.896
I FEEL BETTER THAN EVER.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.190
THE MIGHTY B. HAS NO WEAKNESS.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.401
[WITH MOUTH FULL]: JUST AS
I SUSPECTED.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.945
{\an3}YOU KNOW, I'LL PROBABLY NEED TO
GET BACK ON THE BOOB TUBE

22:02.195 --> 22:04.781
{\an3}JUST TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT
THE MIGHTY B. HAS NO WEAKNESS

22:05.032 --> 22:07.075
{\an6}AND IS INDESTRUCTIBLE
AND INVULNERABLE, AND I'LL
PROBABLY DO A FEW CHAT SHOWS...

22:07.159 --> 22:09.995
Woman: A sudden surprise
popularity of zucchini in China

22:10.245 --> 22:11.621
has brought fortune to
local produce farmers.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.081
We're rich.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.959
Mom, I'm on TV.

22:16.209 --> 22:17.669
Where I belong.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.713
With others of my kind. [Laughs]

22:22.299 --> 22:24.718
[SIGHS]

22:24.968 --> 22:26.344
[SIZZLING]

22:27.512 --> 22:32.350
[BESS[♪...]EZES]
