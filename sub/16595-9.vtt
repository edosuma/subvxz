And it's a shame.

'Cause I think you should worry
less about who you might offend

There is a change in the program
for our final speaker.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.739
It was going to be my father,
Mike Baxter,

19:01.741 --> 19:05.176
but Mr. Baxter refused to comply
with the university guidelines.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.480
You'd like to call me a name,
wouldn't you?

19:09.482 --> 19:12.216
But you can't.
'Cause I'm in a safe space.

19:13.786 --> 19:17.021
Those guidelines
are supposed to protect us.

But from what?

19:18.525 --> 19:20.458
Ideas?

19:20.460 --> 19:22.260
My father never thought
I was so fragile

19:22.262 --> 19:24.195
that he couldn't tell me
what he thinks,

19:24.197 --> 19:25.997
even when I disagree with him.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.366
Which I do.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.701
A lot.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.871
But we both agree
that everyone should be able

19:33.873 --> 19:37.108
to tell their story, even if
it might potentially offend.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.376
Look at our daughter --

19:38.378 --> 19:41.712
making enemies,
just like her dad.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.281
Who'd she get
to replace you?

19:43.283 --> 19:44.982
That's the fun part.

19:44.984 --> 19:48.853
And now our last speaker --
Mariam Jamali.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.189
Originally from Pakistan,
she is the founder

Hey, Mike Baxter here

20:09.209 --> 20:11.042
I know, I know --
the word "man"

20:11.044 --> 20:13.411
can be offensive
to some people.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.912
And if you're a shut-in,

20:14.914 --> 20:17.882
the word "outdoor"
could be a trigger.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.518

And about 100 years later,

20:39.672 --> 20:41.839
a black engineer
named Elijah McCoy

20:41.841 --> 20:44.175
wasn't worried
about offending bigots

20:44.177 --> 20:48.379
when he was first granted

White people were mad

'cause he brought them

Then everybody shut up

he would have been Pat Boone.

After all,
