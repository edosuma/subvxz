So, uh, how did Penny Lane come to be?

01:19.541 --> 01:22.208
How did we, uh, build this place?

01:22.291 --> 01:25.958
Well, now,
that's a very interesting story.

01:26.416 --> 01:31.458
And it all starts with...
Well, you'll see.

01:53.541 --> 01:58.541
So, there I was, thinking I had discovered
a belly-licious mountain of sugar, when--

01:58.625 --> 02:02.791
-Uh, excuse me! I just saw--
-Loop-the-loop.

02:02.875 --> 02:05.166
-Listen to me.
-It's Jaction time!

02:08.791 --> 02:10.916
Please, everyone.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.791
We don't have much time to...

02:14.250 --> 02:18.208
You have to listen!

02:24.416 --> 02:25.916
Are you okay?

02:26.000 --> 02:30.125
Ah. Oh, don't pull too hard or...

02:34.500 --> 02:38.291
-Oh, my. Where did this come from?
-Oh, oh! I've seen one of these before.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.500
Yeah, me, too.

02:40.583 --> 02:46.458
-It's from the, uh, Gigants.
-I think it's from a Gigant.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.166
Didn't I just say that? Uh...

02:49.250 --> 02:54.625
-And it's called, uh, a penny.
-I know what's it's called.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.833
A penny.

03:00.958 --> 03:03.666
They're all too busy to hear me.

03:03.750 --> 03:07.583
Probably wouldn't notice
if I just... disappeared.

03:07.666 --> 03:09.000
Whoa!

03:09.083 --> 03:10.666
Hey!

03:13.791 --> 03:15.416
Help!

03:15.500 --> 03:20.375
-Somebody help me!
-Oh, my stars! Crick.

03:20.458 --> 03:23.291
One of my creations seems
to have captured you.

03:23.375 --> 03:25.375
I do apologize.

03:25.458 --> 03:28.875
I'm creating a new piece of art, you see.

03:28.958 --> 03:34.375
-Your work is, uh, very beautiful, Doris.
-Oh, no, no, no.

03:34.458 --> 03:35.958
This isn't work.

03:36.041 --> 03:39.208
This is how I express myself.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.625
Express yourself?

03:42.708 --> 03:47.208
-I don't understand.
-I used to live in this little box.

03:47.291 --> 03:51.958
No one could see me.
It was like I was invisible.

03:52.041 --> 03:56.291
-Hmm. I know how that feels.
-But one day I peeked out

03:56.375 --> 04:01.458
and saw a magnificent web shining in sun.

04:01.541 --> 04:04.000
I was inspired.

04:04.083 --> 04:08.875
I left that little box
and I began spinning web straightaway.

04:08.958 --> 04:10.541
-Ah.
-That's how I show the world

04:10.625 --> 04:12.125
all the things inside me.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.125
The things I want to say.

04:14.208 --> 04:17.208
I'm no longer hidden in a little box.

04:17.291 --> 04:23.125
Sometimes I feel like...
no one can see or hear me,

04:23.208 --> 04:28.958
like I'm just...
I'm hidden in a little box.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.208
Crick?

04:35.291 --> 04:36.916
Oh, dear.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.458
Whoa. Whoop, whoop. Huh.

04:39.541 --> 04:43.083
Yeah, pull her up,
and the crowd goes wild!

04:44.291 --> 04:45.375
Hey!

04:48.541 --> 04:52.208
-Doris! Get me out of here!
-I'll release you, Jay,

04:52.291 --> 04:54.666
but first we need to have a chat.

04:54.750 --> 04:57.250
Crick thinks no one can see him?

04:57.333 --> 05:01.041
-Uh-huh, yeah, and Doris says--
-But I can see him.

05:01.125 --> 05:04.875
Doris says he can't... express himself.

05:04.958 --> 05:09.291
-I guess we do talk over him sometimes.
-Poor Crick.

05:09.375 --> 05:12.500
He feels like no one ever listens to him.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.625
So, what are we gonna do?

05:14.708 --> 05:16.416
Hmm.

05:17.041 --> 05:18.708
-Whoa!
-Heads!

05:19.250 --> 05:22.291
Oh, my!

05:23.125 --> 05:24.666
Aha!

05:24.750 --> 05:30.750
Friends, this penny has given me
an incredi-belly magnificent idea.

05:30.833 --> 05:35.458
What if we use the pennies
to build a special place?

05:35.541 --> 05:40.416
A place where Crick will be free
to show the world who he truly is.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.666
And we can call it we can call it,
um, uh...

05:43.750 --> 05:46.083
We could call it, uh...

05:47.875 --> 05:50.041
I know.

05:50.416 --> 05:52.250
Penny Lane.

-Hey, Crick, we need you!
-You do?

08:03.625 --> 08:07.666

What's going on in there?

08:37.707 --> 08:43.291
-Uh, oh, just, uh... something.
-Oh, no, more like, uh, nothing, really.

08:43.375 --> 08:46.333
It sounds like something.
Can I have a look?

08:46.416 --> 08:48.333
It's really messy.

08:48.416 --> 08:50.791
You don't wanna see in there.

08:50.875 --> 08:53.166
-Trust me.
-I do want to see.

08:53.250 --> 08:54.625
-Why can't I?
-Shh.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.750
It's a big secret.

08:57.833 --> 09:00.625
Thanks for the crane, Crick!

09:00.708 --> 09:05.958
-But why can't I come, too?

09:09.416 --> 09:12.291
"Thanks for the crane, Crick."

09:12.375 --> 09:19.000
"Hoo. Can't hear you, Crick."
"Hoo. It's a big secret."

09:19.666 --> 09:22.791
I'm no longer hidden
in a little box.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.958
Huh.

09:25.041 --> 09:30.125
Okay! So, you can't hear me, huh?
Or you can't see me?

09:30.208 --> 09:35.000
Then I'll... I'll just have to show you.

09:35.083 --> 09:39.750
My name is Crick and...
My name is Crick,

09:39.833 --> 09:44.833
and I...
I have something to, uh... say!

09:44.916 --> 09:48.708
I will not live in a little box.

09:49.166 --> 09:50.958
Now!

09:57.791 --> 10:00.500
What...? Huh?

10:00.583 --> 10:06.083
-I don't quite, uh... understand what--
-Crick, say something.

10:06.166 --> 10:08.208
Shh. Buzz, let him speak.

10:08.291 --> 10:12.791
-What is all this?
-It's called Penny Lane.

10:12.875 --> 10:14.750
We built it for you, Crick.

10:14.833 --> 10:19.208
It's a magical space
where you can be seen and heard.

10:19.291 --> 10:21.541
Where you can express yourself.

10:21.625 --> 10:22.708

-Yeah.

but I can't accept it.

Huh?

10:37.541 --> 10:39.125

Well, because, uh...

10:42.625 --> 10:45.958
Walter, you love performing.

10:46.041 --> 10:47.416
You should be up here.

for you to, uh... practice your flying.

10:53.416 --> 10:58.375

And, Jay, you always have something
worth saying.

-How's it going with the balloons, Buzz?
-Almost done.

13:03.916 --> 13:06.958
It's impossible. Impossible!

13:07.041 --> 13:12.125
Uh, Walter, don't you think the cake
is a little too ambitious?

13:12.208 --> 13:16.000
It's called berry-ambitious.
That's the whole point.

13:16.083 --> 13:17.625
What's "ambitious" mean?

13:17.708 --> 13:21.208
Uh, it means, uh... aiming high.

13:21.291 --> 13:23.333
It is very high.

13:23.416 --> 13:27.708
Of course it is, heh,
because I am a birthday-cake artiste.

13:27.791 --> 13:30.416
I don't know
how much longer we'll have to get ready.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.666
You said you were keeping
Jay and Crick busy.

13:32.750 --> 13:35.625
I am. I've made the perfect plan.

13:36.333 --> 13:41.375
Hmm. These plans, they do not make sense.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.625
Oh, great.

13:53.708 --> 13:57.333
Now I'll never finish
Kumi's mystery machine.

13:57.416 --> 14:01.083
Sorry, it was in the way of my quadruple
kick flip with the pike twist.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.500
Is that, uh, even possible?

14:04.791 --> 14:06.208
Eh, not so far.

14:06.291 --> 14:08.083
Kumi dared me to pull it off.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.041
Kumi?

14:09.125 --> 14:13.166
But she's the one
who gave me these impossible plans.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.333
Of course.

14:15.416 --> 14:20.083
Kumi's, uh, trying to distract us
while they get everything ready.

14:20.166 --> 14:23.458
Ah! I knew it!
They're planning a surprise party for me.

14:23.541 --> 14:26.041
Well, not just for you.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.750
Uh, what do you mean?

14:29.833 --> 14:33.750
You've forgotten again?

14:33.833 --> 14:36.416
Forgotten what?

14:36.500 --> 14:42.000
It's only something we've known
since, um, the very first time we've met.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.208
You really don't remember?

14:46.750 --> 14:47.958
Hmm.

14:49.166 --> 14:53.250
-Huh? What's going on?
-I...

14:53.333 --> 14:55.875
I think we're...

14:56.291 --> 14:58.916
remembering.

15:03.875 --> 15:05.500
Whoops.

15:05.583 --> 15:09.583
Ha-ha-ha, look at you.
You're so little and funny looking, Crick.

15:11.958 --> 15:14.500
Ouchie. Sorry.

15:14.583 --> 15:19.000
Heh. You're even littler
and funnier looking than me.

15:21.208 --> 15:24.000
Uh, you should watch
where you're bouncing.

15:24.083 --> 15:27.625
You weren't moving.
I thought you were a stick.

15:28.291 --> 15:29.875
Whoo.

15:30.458 --> 15:32.541
Is that present for me?

15:32.625 --> 15:35.041
Why do you think it's for you?

15:35.125 --> 15:41.333
-Because today is my birthday.
-But today is my birthday.

15:41.416 --> 15:43.666
No, it can't be, 'cause it's mine.

15:44.208 --> 15:49.250
I think...
I think it must be both our birthdays.

15:50.958 --> 15:53.083
Huh? Now do you remember?

15:53.166 --> 15:56.500
-We have the same birthday.
-Oh, yeah.

15:56.583 --> 16:00.125
-I knew that.
-What did you get, anyway?

16:02.541 --> 16:05.166
Oh, just this silly thing.

16:05.250 --> 16:07.041
That's not silly.

16:07.958 --> 16:10.000
It's cool.

16:15.333 --> 16:18.541
-A science kit?
-This is silly.

16:18.625 --> 16:21.250
You think a science kit is silly?

16:21.333 --> 16:24.625
-You're crazy.
-Nuh-uh, you're crazy.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.833
-Am not.
-Are too.

16:27.333 --> 16:30.333
Hey, I have an idea.

16:30.416 --> 16:34.791
You like my present
and I like your present,

16:34.875 --> 16:37.583
-so, why don't we, uh...?
-Swap?

16:37.666 --> 16:39.708
I was thinking that, too.

16:56.166 --> 16:59.791
Wow, that's amazing.

16:59.875 --> 17:04.790
I think it's amazing that your birthday
and my birthday are on the same day.

What if they've forgotten?

Hey, bugs,
we're ready for our surprise party now!

18:24.416 --> 18:25.708
Bugs?

18:35.541 --> 18:36.500
Almost done.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.541
Buzz, it's time to bring
our birthday bugs back.

18:39.625 --> 18:42.708
But my berry-ambitious cake
isn't finished.

18:42.791 --> 18:47.125
Don't worry. By the time they follow this,
we'll be ready.

19:01.166 --> 19:03.875

-Oh, not again.

19:03.958 --> 19:06.750
Hmm. Two birthday bugs.

19:06.833 --> 19:09.458
Only one map.

19:13.375 --> 19:16.833
Hmm. So, where do these maps lead?

19:16.916 --> 19:20.541
To the secret location of--
I can't say!

See you
at the surprise party, Buzz.

-Um, why are you--?
-Back where I started?

20:16.750 --> 20:20.875
'Cause the map led me here,
but no surprise party.

20:20.958 --> 20:25.500
Perhaps that's the surprise.
That there is no, uh, party.

20:27.791 --> 20:30.833
Soon it'll be tomorrow, and then we'll...

20:30.916 --> 20:33.541
We'll have missed our birthdays
completely.

20:33.625 --> 20:36.500
Oh, but if we miss our birthdays,

20:36.583 --> 20:39.583
does that mean we stay the same age
for a whole 'nother year?

20:39.666 --> 20:42.000
Or forever?

20:42.083 --> 20:45.041
Let's not, uh, panic... yet.

20:45.125 --> 20:47.125
Remember when we first met?

20:47.208 --> 20:50.708
Remember how we made
our bad birthdays better?

20:50.791 --> 20:52.541
We put our heads together.

20:52.625 --> 20:54.458
Oh, okay.

-Oh! What are you doing?

not--

21:03.250 --> 21:05.375
Jay, look at the maps!

21:06.875 --> 21:11.708
Oh, it's one map, not two.

21:12.666 --> 21:16.166
So, now we know which way to go.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.291
Get on, Crick.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.750
We have to get there before tomorrow.

21:19.833 --> 21:21.916

21:22.000 --> 21:23.750
