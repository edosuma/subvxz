00:01.500 --> 00:03.400
Previously on NYPD Blue.

00:03.200 --> 00:06.100
I'm Lucy Kinley, from the Borough.
I'm your new P.A.A.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.100
Where was God when my boy
got killed in that bar?

00:10.000 --> 00:12.500
- He was there.
- Then he can kiss my ass.

00:12.500 --> 00:15.600
The next time I see you, you're sober
and ready to work or you're through.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.600
Do you want people to help you, Andy?

00:20.500 --> 00:22.300
Yeah.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074

00:49.700 --> 00:52.900
- Andrew.
- How's it going?

00:52.900 --> 00:55.900
I may not be able
to conduct Theo's churching...

00:55.800 --> 00:58.200
and I wanted to have
a moment with you.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.800
I hope that's not out of me
speaking disrespectfully before.

01:00.800 --> 01:05.400
Absolutely not. No, a parishioner is quite ill,
and I may need to be with him.

01:16.200 --> 01:19.800
In our faith, Andrew,
different from his baptism...

01:19.700 --> 01:22.400
the churching service
introduces Theo...

01:22.300 --> 01:26.000
and reestablishes Sylvia's connection
to God and his dwelling.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.700
- Uh-huh.
- I wanted to explain that to you.

01:29.600 --> 01:33.900
And, in honesty, also I wanted to ask after you.

01:35.900 --> 01:38.700
I'm sober. I'm going to meetings.

01:38.700 --> 01:40.600
Seem to be doing okay.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.600
I speak with Sylvia every few days.

01:43.600 --> 01:46.400
She's proud of you and hopeful.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.800
I'm sorry I let her down.

01:49.700 --> 01:52.200
I don't want it to happen no more.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.800
When you and I spoke
at your station house...

01:54.800 --> 01:58.300
I urged you to try to accept
what had happened to AndyJr...

01:58.200 --> 02:01.000
as a mystery
that only God could understand...

02:00.900 --> 02:05.000
and so, perhaps, to unburden yourself
of the pain and loneliness...

02:04.900 --> 02:06.900
that drove you to your drinking.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.199
Anyways, I'm not drinking now.
I'm going to my meetings.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.200
God is quite capable, Andrew.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.800
Today, while he meets Theo...

02:15.800 --> 02:18.400
at the altar and shrine
of his dwelling...

02:18.400 --> 02:21.900
try to give your other son
to his care as well.

02:24.300 --> 02:29.300
In any case, I'm glad
we could speak again as friends.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.700
If I'm not with Theo this afternoon...

02:31.600 --> 02:34.300
I'll be with him in my heart...

02:34.300 --> 02:36.700
and with you and Sylvia as well.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.700
- Detectives.
- Mm-hmm.

04:13.300 --> 04:17.600
They emptied out the register.
And we got a revolver here.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.800
It's a.22 pistol.

04:23.800 --> 04:27.100
- Those are nine-millimeter shells.
- D.O.A. Got a couple off.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.900
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna check outside.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.900
Go ahead.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.800
Andy, D.O.A. Got some shots off.
We might have a wounded perp.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.300
We got a blood trail here.
I got uniform canvassing the hospitals.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.100
Look at that sign, huh?

04:44.200 --> 04:48.100
I'll bet, since this joint opened,
they never painted a car for 199 bucks.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.300
You drive up, there's always
some reason your job costs more.

04:51.300 --> 04:55.500
Maybe we're lookin' for some,
uh, fanatical consumer advocate type.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.500
Yeah.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.100
Did I see you come in the back
at the Brooklyn meeting last night?

05:00.100 --> 05:05.200
Witness on that purse snatch lived
on Flatbush Avenue. I stopped in after.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.300
- Then you just turned around and split.
- I went to one by my place.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.400
'Cause of me?

05:11.300 --> 05:14.600
I'll give you a list of the meetings I'm going to.
Save you on the drive time.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.800
Makes me feel awkward somewhat.

05:17.700 --> 05:21.000
I expect I, uh- I let you down.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.600
You didn't let me down, Andy.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.100
When I was in trouble,
you helped me out.

05:26.100 --> 05:28.700
However I can, I want to help you.

05:28.700 --> 05:32.700
Which can include shutting my yap
or us going to different meetings.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.500
Probably won't be a problem no more.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.800
I was so glad to see you there.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.300
We got a witness down the block
who heard shots.

05:43.300 --> 05:46.000
Sees a white guy beating feet from this
direction, jumps in a maroon Camaro...

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
haulin' ass around the corner.

05:47.900 --> 05:50.100
He couldn't describe the driver
or the guy who jumps in...

05:50.100 --> 05:52.400
but he got a partial
on the license plate.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.500
- Here's the number.
- I'll transmit an alarm.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.800
Yeah.

05:55.800 --> 05:56.700
Yeah.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.100
Sector Boy just responded
on the canvass request.

05:59.100 --> 06:02.000
Guy with a bullet wound
just walked into Bellevue E.R.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.000
- All right. Thanks. Want to take a ride with me?
- Yeah.

06:11.200 --> 06:15.000
- Hey.
- Donald Selness, 37, Bay Ridge address.

06:14.900 --> 06:18.200
Says a psycho shot him in Tompkins Square Park.
They took this out ofhis shoulder.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.100
Ah, thanks.

06:20.100 --> 06:23.000
- Can't even take a walk these days, huh?
- Yeah, I know.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.100
- Detectives Simone, Sipowicz.
- Wanna sit down?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.100
I'd just as soon go home.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.700
We're interested in what went down
with that bullet wound, Donald.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.100
What he said.
Some psycho shot me.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.800
- For no reason?
- Yeah. Maybe I didn't hear him say stop."

06:34.800 --> 06:37.200
- When was this?
- Um, about 6:30.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.400
- You were up pretty early.
- Making the most of my day off.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.300
Anyone see you in the park?

06:42.300 --> 06:45.600
I don't know.
The guy who shot me.

06:45.600 --> 06:50.500
We got a witness description on an armed
robbery, Don, that fits you pretty good.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.700
Well, it wasn't me.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.000
- Wound and everything.
- Not me. Wrong guy.

06:55.900 --> 06:58.700
- Your wheel man drop you here?
- I walked.

06:58.600 --> 07:02.300
You been arrested before? And don't lie,
or I'll shoot you in the other shoulder.

07:02.100 --> 07:05.400
I've been in a few scrapes.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.900
See, that could explain what I'd call
Don's hardcase attitude.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.100
- Let's go and work it out at the station house.
- You arresting me?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.400
You gonna make me use these?

07:14.400 --> 07:17.300
Shoulder don't hurt bad enough,
you want your arms bent back?

07:32.800 --> 07:36.100
Fancy. Oh, yeah.
Thanks for calling back, Inspector.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.700
Um, this new P.A.A. Is not working out.

07:38.700 --> 07:43.300
Yeah, she's a sweet girl, but she needs
three swings to get a roll call right.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.600
Yeah. Yeah, monthly stats
look like a foreign language.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.600
Yeah, yeah. I haven't got time
to teach basic squad administration.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.300
Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.300
Hey.

07:54.400 --> 07:58.600
- Well, one more night on that cot, James.
- Yeah? You found a place?

07:58.500 --> 08:01.900
Yeah. L-I didn't want to say anything previous
so as not to hex the lease negotiation.

08:01.900 --> 08:06.800
It's out by Bobby's. Three rooms,
plus it's got this little laundry room.

08:06.600 --> 08:11.400
- From back there, you can see part of the Brooklyn Bridge.
- Wow. A river view apartment.

08:11.300 --> 08:15.100
Yeah. Well, anyways, I'll be able
to make some decent meals.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
I can have my daughters for overnights,
have more of a social life, you know?

08:18.900 --> 08:23.600
- Have a housewarming party.
- You got a double homicide in an alley off Houston in the Bowery.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.500
Oh, that, uh, like,
little lover's lane over there?

08:25.500 --> 08:29.300
- Yeah. You and James work it with Adrianne?
- Sure, boss.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.900
Hey, Adrianne, we got a case-
a double homicide.

08:31.900 --> 08:34.799
- Okay.
- James, you mind if I eat that? I haven't had any breakfast.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.600
- This? Here you go.
- Yeah.

08:36.600 --> 08:40.700
I'll have a little bowl of fruit
on the kitchen table and everything.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.500
- Hi.
- Hey, Lucy. What's available?

08:43.500 --> 08:47.200
Interview 1. No, uh, Interview 2.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.700
All right. Come here.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.500
Right here.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.600
Hey, guys. Cops found a Camaro
abandoned on a Brooklyn dock.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.700
Should tie to your case.
Bloodstains on the passenger side.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.800
Plates were stripped.
Crime Scene's processing for prints.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.500
- Owner's a Karen Thanos in Queens.
- Thanks, boss.

09:05.500 --> 09:10.200
Josh. You mind staying with this guy in 2
and telling Andy we gotta run something down?

09:10.100 --> 09:12.800
Okay. No problem.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.900
Hi. One for you. For you.

09:15.900 --> 09:19.100
- And you. And you.
- Thanks.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.500
'Entitles bearer to one free haircut.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.300
With gratitude and appreciation,
John Irvin."

09:24.300 --> 09:26.900
- Why you comping out haircuts, John?
- Farewell mementos.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.500
- I'm being transferred back to 1 PP.
- Oh.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.200
John's comping us all
a future haircut, Bobby.

09:32.100 --> 09:35.000
- He's going back to 1 Police Plaza.
- Oh. When's this?

09:35.000 --> 09:39.700
I have a few days built up. I'm taking a friend
to the beach. I start after Memorial Day.

09:39.600 --> 09:44.300
There's a small good-bye party in Anticrime
at 4:00, but you are forbidden to feel obligated.

09:44.300 --> 09:46.700
- Thanks.
- See you later.

09:46.700 --> 09:50.100
- I'll try to make it up there, John.
- You're comped perpetually.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.800
Thank you.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.200
Ah.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.700
Lucy, out with Detective Russell
and Detective Sipowicz.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.800
He's in Interview 2.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.400
Guy in a sweat suit was out running.
He called it in.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.400
Female D.O.A. Took one up close.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.600
I don't see a bullet wound in the male,
but he's white like a zombie.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.500
- You run the plate?
- Not yet.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.700
- I'll do it.
- She's got no purse.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.300
- Any I.D. On that guy?
- Uh-uh. No wallet on him.

10:32.200 --> 10:36.400
- If it's a robbery, why is his pants down?
- Johns bring hookers in here.

10:36.400 --> 10:41.100
Maybe they were gettin' it on, the stickup guy
comes in, this guy tries to run away.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.400
The problem is, how did he die?
He's real pale.

10:43.400 --> 10:46.500
No blood around him.
Maybe he had a heart attack?

10:46.400 --> 10:49.000
Tracks on her arms.
She's probably a hooker.

10:48.900 --> 10:51.400
Yeah, this guy's got tracks too.
They're both junkies.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.400
Just about rules him out as a john.

10:53.300 --> 10:56.500
So, what were they doing here?
Fixing? Maybe a dope rip-off.

10:56.500 --> 10:59.600
Hey. Take a look at this.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.500
That an entry wound?

11:01.400 --> 11:04.100
Yeah.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.800
Yeah. There's the exit wound.
This guy had to have been moved.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.500
He had to have bled to death
somewheres else from a gunshot wound.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.800
Then someone puts his clothes on.
Otherwise, the clothes would be soaked in blood.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.700
Yeah.

11:17.700 --> 11:20.100
Who puts a Band-Aid
on a bullet hole, huh?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.900
Car's registered to
a James and Shelly Bauerline.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.900
Got an address
over on Fourth Street.

11:24.900 --> 11:27.400
If that's Shelly, and this isn'tJames...

11:27.300 --> 11:29.900
then maybeJames took 'em out.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.300
- Is that a bullet hole?
- Yeah.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.500
What's with the Band-Aid?

11:41.300 --> 11:45.200
Thanks. The landlord says that this woman
who owns the Camaro, she holds a job.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.600
She halfway lives with this 25-year-old guy
who's some kind of student.

11:51.900 --> 11:54.200
Who is it?

11:54.100 --> 11:56.900
Police, Miss Thanos.
We'd like to talk to you.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.300
Just a second.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.200
That sounds like a window.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.900
- Good?
- Back off! Back off!

12:04.800 --> 12:07.600
- Anybody else here?
- Hey! Hey! Where are you going?

12:08.600 --> 12:10.800
I can explain. It's not how it looks.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.400
- Andy, you okay?
- Yeah. Get up. What's your name?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.800
Jerry Selness.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.300
- What are you doing jumping out the window, Jerry?
- I don't know. I panicked.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.500
- Are you Karen Thanos?
- Yes.

12:20.400 --> 12:24.000
- You own an '88 Camaro?
- Yeah. I just got back from reporting it stolen.

12:23.900 --> 12:26.200
- Did you find it?
- Yeah, we found it.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.700
- We're going to the station house, Jerry.
- Jerry didn't do anything.

12:28.700 --> 12:31.400
- It's all right, Karen. Don't worry about it.
- You're coming too.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.900
Come on, Karen.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.400
I swear, Jerry wasn't involved
in anything illegal.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.800
Yeah, we're pretty clear there
of your ideas on that.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.600
All's you need to tell 'em's the truth,
Karen. How your car got stolen.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.400
- Come here, Jerry.
- Two's occupied, huh? Josh has got someone in there.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.100
- I'm gonna run this to the boss.
- Come on, Karen.

13:01.100 --> 13:05.000
- You and me are gonna talk in here.
- This is horrible.

13:05.900 --> 13:08.000
This way.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.900
She owns the Camaro.

13:09.900 --> 13:13.000
We go to her apartment, and her boyfriend
tries to go out the back window.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
So we think the boyfriend's in it?

13:14.900 --> 13:18.700
This guy we got in Interview 2, Donald Selness?
The boyfriend's his younger brother.

13:18.700 --> 13:22.400
Josh, do me a favor?
Run these two through B.C. I?

13:22.400 --> 13:26.500
- Sure.
- These two feel like amateurs. We should be okay.

13:26.400 --> 13:30.300
We'rejust trying to find out
what happened.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.800
Karen's still expressing
real concern aboutJerry.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.600
I just don't want to see him
get his life ruined.

13:35.500 --> 13:38.300
Then you gotta help us understand
what's going on here, Karen...

13:38.300 --> 13:40.300
whyJerry was ducking out that window.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.900
- He had no reason to.
- How do you know that?

13:42.900 --> 13:45.300
I know Jerry.

13:45.300 --> 13:49.800
You know Donald too, hmm?
Jerry's older brother?

13:49.800 --> 13:52.600
'Cause we got him in custody
right down the hall there.

13:52.500 --> 13:56.400
Look, I don't know what happened,
but I know Jerry had nothing to do with it.

13:56.400 --> 14:00.600
A man got murdered during a holdup, Karen.
We know Donald was involved.

14:00.400 --> 14:04.800
Donald was wounded. Doctors took bullets out of
his shoulder that match the store owner's weapon.

14:04.800 --> 14:08.300
We also have a witness that saw him running
down the street from the crime scene...

14:08.200 --> 14:10.100
and jumping into your Camaro.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.900
- And you know who the witness saw driving it?
- Oh, God.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.900
Jerry was driving it, Karen.

14:14.900 --> 14:18.900
So that's openers on your file.
False report of a stolen vehicle.

14:18.700 --> 14:21.200
Plus, it's not lookin'so great
Jerry wasn't involved.

14:21.200 --> 14:25.400
Donald said he needed a ride, and Jerry
drove him. That's it. I swear to God.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.800
What do you mean, that's it"?
There was a man who was killed here.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.900
Donald said the guy in the auto shop
owed him money.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.900
- You heard Donald say this?
- He said he owed him money.

14:33.900 --> 14:37.900
But I didn't want to let Donald use my car,
so that's whyJerry drove him.

14:37.800 --> 14:42.100
I swear to God! It was my fault,
not wanting to let Donald use my car.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
If what you're saying's true aboutJerry...

14:44.000 --> 14:46.900
his older brother's got the both of you
in a world of trouble.

14:46.900 --> 14:50.200
Which you better start getting out of
before you and Jerry are both past helping.

14:50.100 --> 14:53.500
When Jerry came back to the apartment
this morning, what did he say had happened?

14:53.500 --> 14:57.100
He said that there was trouble and that
he didn't want to tell me about it...

14:57.100 --> 14:59.400
and that I should report the car stolen.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.900
And you didn't ask him why?

15:01.900 --> 15:05.900
So I guess I am guilty...

15:05.800 --> 15:08.800
because I didn't want to know
what had happened.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.400
Thanks.

15:20.100 --> 15:22.000
How's Karen?

15:22.100 --> 15:25.100
Karen told us that you gave Don
a ride to the auto shop...

15:25.000 --> 15:28.200
but you didn't know
he was gonna shoot anybody.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.700
- Oh, God.
- Just so you understand the law, Jerry...

15:30.700 --> 15:34.800
You driving that car, that's like
committing the robbery and homicide both.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.700
You're just as guilty as your brother Don.

15:36.700 --> 15:41.600
All I know about Don is he's got a rap sheet
a mile long and he killed a guy this morning.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.800
So as far as you standing up for him,
that only makes you his patsy...

15:44.700 --> 15:46.700
or scumbag just like him.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.800
No. Donny's getting his life turned around.
He's been staying out of trouble.

15:49.700 --> 15:53.200
That guy owed him money. All's he
wanted to do was to go down and get it.

15:53.100 --> 15:56.200
- The guy pulled out a gun and shot at him.
- You saw the guy pull a gun out?

15:56.200 --> 15:59.300
No, but that's what Donny said.

15:59.300 --> 16:02.600
Now, when did he say it?
When he came back outside?

16:02.600 --> 16:06.400
When he jumped into the car and you guys
booked? You drove him to the hospital, right?

16:06.200 --> 16:08.700
Look, he said he owed him money,
and that is all I know.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.000
How did it work, Jerry?

16:10.900 --> 16:13.600
Did he tell you to take the car
to the docks and strip the plates?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.500
Is that how he told you to do it?

16:15.500 --> 16:17.500
He was defending himself.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.700
Now, I'm not gonna testify
against my brother.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.700
I turned that Karen loose.

16:30.700 --> 16:34.800
Just looking at some documents
relevant to Don here.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.700
Don's 37.

16:36.700 --> 16:40.200
Since he's 18, he's in the joint
16 and a half years.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.700
And none of those were wrong beefs.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.600
For nine separate collars?

16:44.600 --> 16:47.600
Yet so often we hear this nonsense
regards the incorrigible criminals.

16:47.600 --> 16:52.300
And, uh, this information
out of our ballistics unit, Don?

16:52.200 --> 16:56.000
This says the bullet from your shoulder
came from the D.O.A.'s gun.

16:55.900 --> 16:58.900
- Sounds bad.
- Your brother gave you up, Don.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.700
- No, he didn't.
- No?

17:02.700 --> 17:05.200
He didn't tell me that you said
this guy owed you money?

17:05.099 --> 17:08.599
How his girlfriend didn't want you driving
her car, so he said that he would drive you?

17:08.400 --> 17:12.400
And here you come, running after the stickup,
saying, 'The guy pulled a piece on me.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.900
I had to shoot him in self-defense."

17:14.800 --> 17:17.700
That's wet behind the ears,
wouldn't you say, Don?

17:17.700 --> 17:20.900
- Kid even believes self-defense.
- So where's the part where he gave me up?

17:20.800 --> 17:24.000
So we disagree- did Jerry mean the flip?

17:23.900 --> 17:27.400
Let me give you that he didn't.
He's not looking for any deals.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.800
He will never give you guys a statement.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.300
Ever hear of a D.A. Losing a case
with circumstantial evidence up the ass...

17:33.200 --> 17:36.100
but no confession?

17:36.100 --> 17:39.100
Why not roll the dice, huh?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.200
You crap out, no one's screwed but your brother,
'cause he will go away for the homicide too.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.200
- He didn't do nothin'.
- Mm-mmm. It's gotta be, He didn't, but I did."

17:45.200 --> 17:47.800
- Kiss my ass.
- Hey!

17:50.600 --> 17:52.500
Hit me again.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.200
Appreciate you coming in,
Mr. Bauerline.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.300
Yeah. Uh, do you have information
regarding my wife?

18:00.300 --> 18:04.900
- I mean, I'm grateful you recovered my car, but-
- Did you use that car?

18:04.800 --> 18:07.100
Um, she had it for the last year.

18:07.100 --> 18:10.000
She took the car and blew out my credit cards,
almost ruined my business.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.200
When was the last time
you saw your wife, Mr. Bauerline?

18:12.200 --> 18:16.300
Has something happened to Shelly?
Has she committed a crime?

18:16.100 --> 18:18.300
Your wife was found dead this morning.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.900
She was shot.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.500
I'm very sorry.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.100
Uh...

18:29.100 --> 18:32.300
This is drugs.
Drugs are involved in this somehow.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.900
Why do you say that?

18:34.900 --> 18:37.900
She got involved, uh, taking heroin.

18:37.900 --> 18:40.100
Got involved with a guy.

18:40.100 --> 18:44.500
I'm sorry. What did you say when we asked
when you saw your wife last?

18:44.400 --> 18:46.900
It was several months.

18:46.900 --> 18:49.500
- But you knew she was seeing someone else?
- That make you mad at her?

18:49.500 --> 18:52.100
Do you want to know the truth?

18:52.100 --> 18:54.700
I never got mad at her.

18:54.700 --> 18:59.600
I tried to help her, tried to be there for her,
tried to talk to her.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.700
- Can you tell us where you were last night, Jim?
- I was at my dad's.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.600
He's not been well.
I spent the night.

19:04.600 --> 19:08.100
- Is that gonna check out if we call?
- Yes. What do you mean?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.300
Do you know where Shelly was staying?

19:10.400 --> 19:14.200
No, they got thrown out of the place
that they were staying in.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.200
All I have is the address
of the boyfriend's mother's business.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.400
She gave me a bunch of stories
about how much he needed money.

19:20.400 --> 19:24.100
Something about
some terrible liver disease.

19:23.900 --> 19:26.200
His name is Les Treet.

19:34.900 --> 19:38.700
Excuse me. Uh, Detective Medavoy, NYPD.
Are you Mrs. Treet?

19:38.600 --> 19:41.000
Yes, I am.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.400
This is Detective Lesniak
and Detective Martinez.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.900
We were hoping to speak
to Mr. Treet, if he's here.

19:45.900 --> 19:48.800
- Mr. Treet passed away a year ago.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.700
Other family helping out?

19:50.700 --> 19:53.800
Well, my son Les. He's resting.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.500
We've had some break-in attempts.
He's agreed to stay here nights.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.900
We need to speak with your son Les,
Mrs. Treet.

19:58.900 --> 20:00.900
All right. He's upstairs.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.000
Hasn't been feeling well.
He had hepatitis.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.300
He made a little place for himself
up there, in the storage area.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.900
Les! Lester.

20:10.900 --> 20:14.400
- Some people want to see you, honey.
- Who? I don't know nobody.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.500
Hey, Les. I'm Detective Martinez.
This is Det. Medavoy and Lesniak.

20:17.500 --> 20:21.800
Oh, I told you not to smoke here, honey.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.300
- You know it's very dangerous.
- Yeah. Okay, Ma.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.200
You live here regular now, Les?

20:26.200 --> 20:29.400
- Helping out Mom.
- He has a roommate, but they're not getting on right now.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.700
He can stay here
till he finds a new place.

20:31.700 --> 20:36.200
- You look a little extra tired. Are you loaded or something?
- I told you he's been sick.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.600
- What's the address you been staying at?
- Why?

20:38.500 --> 20:42.400
- What's the address?
- I'm in my business, resting where I work for my mother.

20:42.300 --> 20:45.100
I'm not bothering nobody.
Isn't that right, Ma?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
- Yeah.
- He ashamed ofhis address or something?

20:46.900 --> 20:49.200
- Where you been staying?
- Over on Second Avenue.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.900
I thought you were staying
at Shelly Bauerline's.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.600
I know where I've been staying, Ma.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.500
Yes, Shelly's, on Avenue D."

20:56.500 --> 20:59.400
- No.
- Come on, Les. Get up. Come on.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.400
Something happened to Les's girlfriend,
Shelly. We have to ask him some questions.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.000
- Oh, no, he's got to rest. Can't you come back?
- Come on, Les.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.600
- He'll be just fine.
- Okay. Not so fast, okay?

21:19.400 --> 21:21.700
- Hi, Lieutenant.
- How you doin'?

21:21.700 --> 21:25.400
- Good.
- It looks like you got some fans at the Borough.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.500
Inspector Aiello says
they want you back down there.

21:27.500 --> 21:30.200
Is that so? Right away?

21:30.100 --> 21:33.600
Well, that's the impression I had, but,
uh, if you've got some time built up...

21:33.500 --> 21:37.300
maybe you'd like to take it
and go back after Memorial Day.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.700
I was just thinking, if it's not as much
as me having fans at the Borough...

21:40.600 --> 21:43.500
and more like you're not
being satisfied with my work...

21:43.400 --> 21:47.300
I was just hoping maybe you could give me
a few more days to change your mind.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.000
Well, um...

21:49.900 --> 21:54.300
Y- You got along very well
in a diverse squad.

21:54.200 --> 21:57.500
Um, you're a very pleasant
and friendly person.

21:57.500 --> 22:00.500
But, um, your secretarial skills...

22:00.400 --> 22:02.400
they need a lot of work.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.900
I'm starting night classes. I'm taking
typing and general office management.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.700
Well, I think you'd need
to complete those...

22:08.700 --> 22:12.200
before you're, um, likely
to work effectively in a squad situation.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.600
All right.
Thank you for letting me know.

22:16.600 --> 22:20.500
- So you keep me posted on how you do on those courses.
- I will, Lieutenant.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.400
Okay.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.700
Leo Cohen. I'm riding D.A.

22:29.700 --> 22:32.500
Which means you're covering precinct business
for the district attorney's office...

22:32.400 --> 22:35.200
today, in this sector of the borough.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.200
And these are the detectives
I'm looking for...

22:37.200 --> 22:41.400
but I'm gonna come back later and give you
a gold star for knowing my job specs, okay?

22:41.200 --> 22:44.700
- On that homicide this morning, am I missing something?
- Hard for me to imagine.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.600
Why aren't we charging
the Selness brothers?

22:46.500 --> 22:49.200
We're trying to figure out
if the younger one knew what was going on.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.600
That's why juries were invented.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.200
The older brother's been in the joint
his whole life. The younger brother's clean.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.500
Donald says
that hejust asked Jerry to drive.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.200
- What's in that for us?
- You get a statement from the older brother.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.300
Who I've already got by the short hairs.

23:01.300 --> 23:04.000
Younger brother's indictable.
They can worry about his complicity at trial.

23:03.900 --> 23:08.200
Cohen. We got a more or less okay kid in there
that just got caught in the switches.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.700
Why not throw the guy a break?
Isn't that part of it too?

23:10.700 --> 23:13.900
Bet you'd have been a decent guy if somebody
would've beat you three times a week...

23:13.800 --> 23:16.300
in high school.

23:16.200 --> 23:20.700
The older brother has to exculpate
as to the younger brother's conduct...

23:20.600 --> 23:22.700
and corroborate exactly
the younger one's account.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.700
Thanks.

23:24.700 --> 23:27.900
Offer's good to the end of the tour.
Then we charge the both of them.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.700
End of the tour, huh?

23:42.600 --> 23:44.800
You making friends with this guy?

23:46.400 --> 23:48.600
Okay, here's how it stands, Jerry.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.700
The bullet from Donald's shoulder wound?

23:50.700 --> 23:54.100
That matches the weapon of the store owner
this morning in the homicide.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.500
We got witnesses' descriptions that put you
both in the car leaving the crime scene.

23:58.300 --> 24:00.700
Bloodstains on the car seat-
those are Donald's.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.700
- He's getting charged.
- And you are too.

24:02.700 --> 24:05.200
You're getting charged, too, Jerry,
unless you both give a statement...

24:05.200 --> 24:07.600
that corroborates that you did not
have an active role in this.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.900
In other words, I rat Donny out.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.500
Hey, Jerry, did I just not give you
three pieces of evidence...

24:12.500 --> 24:16.600
that have nothing to do with you testifying against
your brother that are gonna put him in jail?

24:16.500 --> 24:18.500
We're banging our heads
against concrete here.

24:18.500 --> 24:23.500
Jerry, Donald is gone for the rest of his life.
Now, that's off the table.

24:23.300 --> 24:26.300
The only question here is what you're
gonna do for the next 25 years.

24:26.300 --> 24:30.100
And the answer's time in jail,"
if you don't give the statement, huh?

24:30.100 --> 24:33.600
Which can't rat Donald out
'cause unless he cooperates, too...

24:33.500 --> 24:36.000
tells us the same thing
about what happened...

24:36.000 --> 24:38.900
none of this matters anyway, huh?

24:38.900 --> 24:42.300
Uh, coming through in there, Jerry, huh?
Is anybody in the residence?

24:42.300 --> 24:45.500
What if this is a trick or something?
All right? Can I see my brother?

24:45.500 --> 24:48.200
You cannot see your brother.
The statements have to be made separately.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.400
Then how do I know this isn't a trick?

24:50.400 --> 24:53.500
We're working like coolies
to keep this kid out ofjail.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.700
He could probably beat it on a moron defense.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.400
What?

24:59.400 --> 25:01.300
Do you understand
we're trying to help you here?

25:01.300 --> 25:06.800
They found a nine-millimeter in the weeds
about 75 yards from the Camaro. No prints.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.000
- Bobby.
- Yeah.

25:20.900 --> 25:24.300
You were right, Don.
The kid's holding up pretty good.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.100
Mm-hmm. All that time
that you were in thejoint...

25:27.000 --> 25:30.700
he probably built up this big idea
of how you were a good guy.

25:30.700 --> 25:34.100
Hey, listen. Every week, all the places
that kid got passed around to...

25:34.000 --> 25:37.500
I wrote to him
and I told him good things.

25:37.500 --> 25:40.800
That kid's three credits
away from his degree.

25:43.100 --> 25:46.500
We found the gun, Don,
with just his prints.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.400
You wearing gloves?

25:48.400 --> 25:51.700
He was probably so scared and nervous when he
was throwing the gun away, like you told him to...

25:51.700 --> 25:53.600
he forgot to wipe it off.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.600
That kid had nothing to do with this!

25:56.500 --> 25:59.100
- Now, do a decent thing, would you?
- Us?

25:59.100 --> 26:02.000
I had a kid Jerry's age.

26:01.900 --> 26:05.900
He was a great kid.
Nobody didn't like him.

26:05.900 --> 26:09.700
And I can't do nothing for that kid...

26:09.600 --> 26:14.100
'cause some scumbag like you
murdered him.

26:19.500 --> 26:22.100
You can give this kid a life.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.800
Forty, 50 years...

26:24.700 --> 26:28.700
where he could make some kind of a contribution,
people are glad he's around.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.700
I'll give a statement.

26:36.700 --> 26:40.400
You want a frickin'statement...

26:40.400 --> 26:42.900
I'll give a statement on why I did it.

26:42.900 --> 26:46.500
The D.A.'s not gonna give him a walk
unless that kid gives a statement too.

26:46.400 --> 26:49.400
So you gotta let him know that you
don't think that he's letting you down.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.900
- Can I talk to him?
- You can write him a note.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.200
First you give your statement.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.100
Let's do it.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.900
- Hey, Les. You don't feel so good, huh?
- I'm gonna be sick.

27:11.900 --> 27:14.900
- Now?
- I'm gonna be real sick real soon.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.700
Could we work my medication out now
while I'm still well?

27:17.700 --> 27:20.800
Tell us how Shelly and the other guy got shot.
Then we can look at the medication question.

27:20.800 --> 27:25.100
Shelly Bauerline's a girl
I've taken drugs with. End of story.

27:24.900 --> 27:27.700
Shelly Bauerline's a girl you've taken drugs with
who was found murdered.

27:27.700 --> 27:31.400
Plus another guy got murdered with her.
Any ideas in that area?

27:31.300 --> 27:35.600
- I would like to get my medication squared away.
- Start showing some good faith.

27:35.500 --> 27:38.200
The guy's name is Carl Steppes.

27:38.100 --> 27:40.400
The guy found dead with Shelly?

27:40.300 --> 27:44.100
I'm gonna need Valium and two-milligram
patches of Clonidine so I can sleep.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.800
You shut up about drugs for five straight minutes,
or we'll lock you down for five hours.

27:48.700 --> 27:52.800
I know about the incident
you're describing, okay?

27:52.800 --> 27:56.400
I helped a person,
whose name I'm not gonna tell you...

27:56.200 --> 27:59.200
who was involved in shooting Carl.

27:59.100 --> 28:02.800
Carl had taken this person's
last dime bag...

28:02.800 --> 28:05.400
which he was saving for his wake up.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.600
But the person was mistaken...

28:07.600 --> 28:10.000
later found the bag on the floor.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.400
He p- He put a Band-Aid on Carl...

28:12.400 --> 28:16.000
'cause he had
this little tiny hole in his chest.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.500
Then he realized he was bleeding...

28:18.400 --> 28:20.900
from another hole in his back...

28:20.900 --> 28:23.600
when he picked him up,
'cause there was blood all over the carpet.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.800
Asked me to help take him out of there.

28:25.800 --> 28:28.900
All right.
Where was Shelly in all this?

28:28.700 --> 28:31.100
Shelly, I and the other person...

28:31.200 --> 28:35.500
we dressed Carl,
rolled him up in a rug.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.400
And while we were driving,
it turns out Shelly boots the bag...

28:38.300 --> 28:40.300
this guy thought Carl had used...

28:40.300 --> 28:42.600
sitting there,
nodding on his wake up.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.800
So then he-he-he- the other guy...

28:44.700 --> 28:48.900
he realized that she had taken
his wake-up bag, so then he shot her.

28:48.800 --> 28:52.000
This, uh, mystery guest, Les-
any chance he's made up...

28:52.000 --> 28:55.900
or we're just talkin' about,
uh, you, Carl, Shelly?

28:55.900 --> 29:00.400
No. No. No. And I've shown
some pretty damn good faith here.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.600
I want some medication on the table.

29:02.500 --> 29:05.400
Stop kidding yourself.
This ain't a pharmacy.

29:05.400 --> 29:08.400
Yeah, I happen to know you can get
a doctor to prescribe right now.

29:08.300 --> 29:13.200
No one's prescribing here. Best you're gonna do
is an aspirin till we get a full statement.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.700
All right. You listen to me.
You listen to me. You listen to me good.

29:17.600 --> 29:21.400
I got methadone prescribed
to me legally in my name. Okay?

29:21.300 --> 29:25.400
And I refuse to speak to you unless that's
brought to me from my mother's place.

29:25.400 --> 29:28.300
It's hidden on the first ledge,
where you were at.

29:30.900 --> 29:34.900
I'll give you what you want.
Just bring me the stuff.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.900
Want to take a ride?

29:38.900 --> 29:41.700
Ah, come on, please.
Take a ride with him.

29:57.700 --> 30:00.700
Any kind of commotion, Mr. Bauerline,
you're out of the station house.

30:00.700 --> 30:03.300
I won't cause a commotion.
I just wanna lay eyes on him.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.200
Okay. Have a seat.

30:05.200 --> 30:08.400
I better run this by the boss.

30:09.700 --> 30:12.600
- Thanks.
- D.O.A.'s estranged husband, boss.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.700
Uh, we're picking up the perp's meds...

30:14.600 --> 30:17.400
he's out there trying to get the mother
to tell him what's going on.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.300
So why'd you bring him back?

30:19.300 --> 30:22.900
We collared up off this guy giving us
the address. He's heartbroken.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.700
He just wants to see
what this creep looks like.

30:25.700 --> 30:29.600
- He gets a look.
- Uh, we found Treet's methadone.

30:29.500 --> 30:31.400
You know, verifying the prescription.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.200
I figured I'd give him, like,
a quarter dose just to get him rolling.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.800
You feel the need to go into more detail
on this with me, Greg?

30:36.700 --> 30:38.700
- No, sir.
- Good.

30:38.700 --> 30:42.200
Les has me on a 45-second cycle
seeing if you guys got back.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.200
Yeah.

30:44.200 --> 30:48.200
Listen, the D.O.A. 's husband was out at
Treet's place. We said we'd give him a look.

30:48.200 --> 30:51.900
Could you just sit with him, Adrianne,
till we see how this bum acts on this stuff?

30:51.800 --> 30:53.800
No problem.

30:57.300 --> 31:01.000
- Okay.
- Imagine if I got past seventh grade.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.900
World's had a boot on your neck right along,
Don. No question in my mind on that score.

31:04.800 --> 31:08.400
NowJerry's gotta give up his statement.
We've been in there twice more with him.

31:08.400 --> 31:13.100
He says that he's not gonna do it unless you
and him talk private, you give him an okay.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.600
You said him and me couldn't talk.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.100
We're gonna break the rules,
give the kid one last chance.

31:18.100 --> 31:20.900
We're gonna bring Jerry in here and let you talk
to him. He'll give a statement or he won't.

31:20.800 --> 31:23.200
But that's it for us in this case.

31:23.100 --> 31:25.400
Then the D.A. 's can have it.

31:25.400 --> 31:28.500
And they'll go after both of you.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.900
Get him to give it up, Don.

31:30.900 --> 31:34.800
We'll be watching through that mirror here.
I know that's a shock to you.

31:38.900 --> 31:41.800
Okay. Let's go.

31:54.500 --> 31:56.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:59.900 --> 32:02.800
You all right?

32:02.800 --> 32:04.700
They hit you?

32:04.700 --> 32:07.100
No.

32:07.100 --> 32:09.000
Come here. Sit down.

32:19.800 --> 32:24.000
You gotta give up a statement, Jer.
All right?

32:24.000 --> 32:26.400
- Just tell the truth. Tell 'em what you did.
- No.

32:26.400 --> 32:28.900
No, you wouldn't do that to me.

32:28.900 --> 32:32.200
Uh, don't make it no worse for me.
I already gave them a statement.

32:32.100 --> 32:35.300
- You know? You just look out for yourself here now.
- Myself?

32:35.300 --> 32:37.200
- Yeah.
- Donny, you're my brother.

32:37.200 --> 32:40.700
I wanted to have
some kind of life with you.

32:40.700 --> 32:43.700
- It didn't work out this time.
- Oh, no, Donny.

32:50.700 --> 32:55.000
You know, the best time I ever had,
best part of my life...

32:54.900 --> 32:58.500
was when I was writing letters to you,
imagining that I was helping you.

32:59.300 --> 33:01.200
If you're outside...

33:01.300 --> 33:04.100
you could give me
some of the life that you got.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.500
You know, when we're alone
in a cell, we...

33:06.500 --> 33:09.400
we got nothing except dreams
about what's out there.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.500
You can give me some of that.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.300
You could give me the ocean.

33:14.300 --> 33:17.100
You know?
I mean, I can be right there.

33:17.100 --> 33:19.800
I can be puking off the side
of a fishing boat.

33:21.300 --> 33:26.000
You know, I mean, you get incarcerated,
I got no dreams.

33:25.800 --> 33:28.300
I'm dead.

33:28.300 --> 33:30.800
- We're lucky, you and I.
- Yeah.

33:30.800 --> 33:34.200
I can line my walls
with pictures of your kids.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.800
- I need you to help me here, Jer.
- No, Donny!

33:41.600 --> 33:44.600
Come here, come here,
come here, come here. Come here.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.500
No, no! Donny!

33:49.800 --> 33:52.200
Come on, come on, come on.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.300
You just write the statement, all right?

33:59.100 --> 34:01.100
- Okay.
- All right.

34:10.300 --> 34:12.199
Carl had to slam crank.

34:12.199 --> 34:14.199
I could walk away from crank today.

34:14.199 --> 34:16.800
I'll do it, if it's in front of me.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.199
But 11:00 to 5:00 dope is me.

34:19.199 --> 34:23.000
I saw a guy bit his tongue off behind crank.
His jaw locked up.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.100
Hey, stop the drug seminar.
Did you shoot Carl?

34:27.600 --> 34:30.300
I confess to shooting Carl Steppes...

34:30.300 --> 34:33.000
over a misunderstanding
over his taking my wake-up dope...

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
and in disposing of his body.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.699
I confess I killed Shelly Bauerline...

34:37.699 --> 34:41.600
who'd shot my wake-up dope herself
while we were driving Carl's body...

34:41.500 --> 34:44.300
and who'd wound up
a skanky dime-bag whore.

34:44.199 --> 34:47.199
I'm less sure I gave her the hep
than she gave it to me.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.800
I will not sign this as a statement...

34:49.699 --> 34:54.699
until I've received the rest
of my legally prescribed medication.

34:59.500 --> 35:02.100
Are you goin' to get it?

35:02.100 --> 35:05.000
I gotta check with your clinic doctor.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.900
Don't feel the need to hold nothin' back
while I'm gone.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.200
All right. All right?

35:13.200 --> 35:16.300
It's a roll of the wheel now.

35:16.300 --> 35:19.900
If you want, Mr. Bauerline, you can take
your look at him now through the window.

35:19.700 --> 35:22.600
Can I listen to what he's saying?

35:22.600 --> 35:25.700
Uh, I think we'll just stick with the look.

35:25.700 --> 35:27.700
I'll be right back.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.600
He looks like a rat.
That's who she left me for?

35:40.700 --> 35:42.700
I loved her.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.100
I wanted to make a life with her,
have a family.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.400
She told me all she cared about was...

35:55.300 --> 35:57.800
feeling that warm go through her...

35:57.700 --> 36:00.100
the drugs going into her body.

36:01.300 --> 36:03.500
I don't believe
that's truly who Shelly was.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.200
I mean, I've known her since-
since high school.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.700
I've known her
since she was 15 years old.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.900
- L-
- Mr. Bauerline.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.300
Why don't you and I
go out for a cup of coffee?

36:15.300 --> 36:17.300
Hmm?

36:20.200 --> 36:24.100
- I really wouldn't want to impose.
- It's not an imposition.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.300
Come on. Let's go.

36:42.500 --> 36:46.200
You know what I'm really gonna miss?
These cards that he gave us.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.100
- No, thanks.
- Detective Sipowicz.

36:48.100 --> 36:50.500
Listen, uh, I got a personal function.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.400
I just- I just want to say so long.

36:52.400 --> 36:55.600
You didn't get a haircut coupon, free.

36:57.100 --> 36:59.600
Well, Sylvia liked how you did it before.

36:59.500 --> 37:02.600
I think there's the guy
you're looking for.

37:02.500 --> 37:06.200
Anyways, I got this personal function.
Good luck to you, John.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.800
Thank you, Detective.
Thank you for being my friend.

37:12.300 --> 37:15.500
Mother! Didn't I specifically
request you not do this?

37:15.400 --> 37:18.200
I thought your friends
might like a sweet.

37:18.200 --> 37:21.100
Th-These are my colleagues,
and this is Noreen Irvin...

37:21.100 --> 37:24.600
with whom I'm going to be having a very
serious conversation when we get home.

37:24.500 --> 37:27.100
Come on, John.
You got cake eaters waiting.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.200
How are you doing?
I'm Lieutenant Fancy.

37:29.200 --> 37:33.500
She does make the best Bundt cake
in all five boroughs. You!

37:33.400 --> 37:35.700
I can't believe you did this.

37:35.700 --> 37:38.700
- Hi. Greg Medavoy.
- Anne McGuire.

37:38.700 --> 37:41.800
- You're in Anticrime, huh?
- Yeah. For the last couple of months.

37:41.800 --> 37:44.100
You're the phantom of the crib.

37:44.100 --> 37:46.000
Oh, yeah.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.400
Yeah, I-I've been staying there
during some domestic upset.

37:49.300 --> 37:52.000
No more though.
I'm moving out tomorrow.

37:51.900 --> 37:54.700
I found a pleasant
three-room apartment in Brooklyn.

37:54.500 --> 37:58.100
- That's good.
- Yeah, I-I'm very pleased.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.500
- What about yourself? Where do you live?
- Hempstead.

38:00.500 --> 38:02.900
- Yeah, I live with my folks.
- Bundt cake.

38:02.800 --> 38:04.700
- Thanks, John.
- Thank you.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.000
Yeah, I used to live in Nassau.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.400
My ex and my kids still live there.
Drive can get iffy sometimes.

38:10.400 --> 38:12.900
Well, I do mostly 6:00 to 2:00,
so that's not too bad.

38:12.900 --> 38:14.900
Ah, then you're in good shape. Yeah.

38:17.400 --> 38:20.400
Hi.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.200
So D.A. Cohen put
the younger brother in for a walk.

38:23.100 --> 38:25.100
- Good.
- Yeah.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.500
- It's nice when one works out.
- Would you like some Bundt cake, young man?

38:28.500 --> 38:31.500
Uh, this is Detective Simone, Mother.
My mom, Noreen Irvin.

38:31.500 --> 38:34.200
- Pleased to meet you.
- I knew this was him.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.700
My son says you're the greatest
policeman sinceJack Webb.

38:37.600 --> 38:41.800
- That's pretty good company.
- Mother, I'm going to leap through an open window.

38:41.800 --> 38:44.800
Diane and I were just talking about
taking advantage of the weather...

38:44.700 --> 38:47.600
and go out for a little walk,
having some dinner.

38:47.600 --> 38:50.600
So you won't take any offense
if I save my appetite?

38:50.500 --> 38:53.000
I'm just hoping the weather
holds through the weekend.

38:52.900 --> 38:56.100
- John is treating me to a trip to Fire Island.
- Really?

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
Do you want to show them
my baby pictures too?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.200
- You take care, John.
- You too.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.900
- And good luck on this new assignment.
- Yes!

39:03.900 --> 39:06.200
- Come and see us.
- I will.

39:06.200 --> 39:09.000
- Bye.
- Thanks a lot.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
You looked like a deer in headlights
when his mom came over.

39:11.900 --> 39:13.900
I just had eyes to get out.

39:13.900 --> 39:18.600
Lovely spring thus far, huh?
L- I've been remarkably allergy-free.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.800
Both of your sons are with you.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.700
Try to pray.

39:43.700 --> 39:46.700
The servant of God, Theo,
is brought within the church...

39:46.700 --> 39:50.300
in the name of the Father
and of the Son...

39:50.200 --> 39:52.500
and of the Holy Spirit.

39:52.500 --> 39:54.400
Amen.

40:00.900 --> 40:05.100
I shall enter your house, O Lord.
I shall worship in your temple.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.400
The servant of God, Theo...

40:07.300 --> 40:09.900
is brought before you
in the name of the Father...

40:09.900 --> 40:13.200
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.100
Amen.

40:26.300 --> 40:30.200
In the middle of the church,
I shall praise you.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.300
The servant of God, Theo, is brought
within the church, in the name of the Father...

40:34.200 --> 40:38.000
Please keep care of my other son, too,
and take him to your heart.

40:37.900 --> 40:40.300
Amen.

40:43.400 --> 40:46.800
In the name of the Father
and of the Son...

40:46.700 --> 40:48.800
and of the Holy Spirit.

40:48.700 --> 40:51.400
Amen.

40:51.300 --> 40:54.900
Now, Master, let your servant depart in peace,
according to your promise...

40:54.800 --> 40:57.100
for my eyes have seen your salvation...

40:57.200 --> 41:01.000
which you have prepared
in the presence of all peoples.

41:04.600 --> 41:07.400
Bless and keep my son who's gone...

41:07.300 --> 41:09.800
and bless and keep all my family...

41:09.800 --> 41:13.400
and give me strength
to be a good person.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.500
Glory to you, O God, our hope.
Glory to you.

41:30.400 --> 41:33.500
May Christ have mercy on us
and save us...

41:33.500 --> 41:37.800
for he's a good and merciful God
who loves mankind.

41:37.700 --> 41:40.600
Through the prayers
of our holy fathers, amen.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.500
Amen.

41:45.400 --> 41:47.300
Amen.

41:58.600 --> 42:01.900
- This was good, huh?
- Yeah. It was good.

42:03.700 --> 42:08.700
You know, ever since I improved on that
first course for you over at Oswaldo's...

42:08.500 --> 42:12.800
you haven't been showing
much enthusiasm about our meals.

42:12.700 --> 42:16.600
Well, you know,
I'd ask you to slide over here...

42:16.600 --> 42:19.700
and, uh, do something about that.

42:19.600 --> 42:24.000
I got a better idea.
You got any vacation time?

42:25.500 --> 42:28.000
I think I have nine days left.
I used some up with my mom.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.200
You want to throw some things together,
drive down to the shore for a while?

42:31.200 --> 42:33.100
You mean it?

42:33.100 --> 42:36.200
I don't trifle about vacations, Diane.

42:38.100 --> 42:40.700
Twenty minutes after I met you...

42:40.700 --> 42:44.400
I was hoping real bad
you were gonna be a nice guy.

42:44.300 --> 42:47.600
As good a cop and as hot as you were...

42:47.400 --> 42:50.400
I knew I was gonna have feelings for you.

42:50.400 --> 42:53.200
How lucky I turned out.

42:53.200 --> 42:55.700
Is that a yeah" on the vacation?

42:55.700 --> 42:58.000
Yeah.

43:00.600 --> 43:03.700
I want to spend some time with you.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.900
Excuse me.

43:12.400 --> 43:14.900
Mmm.

43:14.900 --> 43:16.900
Let's get out of town.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.300
Thanks.
