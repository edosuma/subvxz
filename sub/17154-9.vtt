that led you to the new song, Nick.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.083
That's what I figured.

13:22.166 --> 13:24.875
That's why today
I wore your favorite shoes.

13:24.959 --> 13:26.250
Not my lucky loafers!

13:26.917 --> 13:29.750
OK, look, I appreciate you guys doing this

13:29.834 --> 13:33.417
to try to make the deadline,
but don't... don't go overboard, OK?

13:34.000 --> 13:37.166

-We covered this one last night.
-Yes, we did, but it didn't count

13:51.250 --> 13:53.709
because it was last night,
and it was Kevin, and it was low-fat.

13:56.125 --> 13:58.208
Don't hit me
because you didn't hit me yesterday.

[students laughing]

14:17.458 --> 14:19.250
Hey.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.375
I fixed the jacket.

14:21.458 --> 14:25.750
Look, I know it was an accident,
so... try it on.

14:26.667 --> 14:30.709
-Any luck with the song writing?
-Actually, I wrote a song

14:30.792 --> 14:31.792
in a dream I had last night.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.500
-Hey.
-Then I forgot it.

14:33.583 --> 14:35.208
So, in order to have the same dream again,

14:35.291 --> 14:36.917
I have to repeat everything
I did yesterday.

14:37.000 --> 14:37.917
Kevin's idea?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.375
-Yeah.
-It actually makes sense.

14:40.458 --> 14:42.000
It was bound to happen eventually.

14:42.083 --> 14:46.875
Well, the only thing I can remember
you did yesterday was ruin my jacket.

No! No, no, no, no! No!

14:51.959 --> 14:53.875

It's for the band.

I'm not gonna fall for that one.

15:18.583 --> 15:21.458
-But he's probably cute.
-Kevin!

15:21.875 --> 15:23.667
I can't believe I fell for it again.

There's one more thing.

we have to repeat everything.

you and I go out tonight?

-What?

-Let me explain.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.417
Yesterday I dreamt a song,
but then I forgot what I dreamt.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.291
So, today, I have to do
everything I did yesterday

17:27.375 --> 17:29.792
so I can have the same dream,
so I can remember the same song.

we've covered everything on the list.

Nick, don't worry if we have to
cancel the tour and the album.

You know, we can just find different jobs,
