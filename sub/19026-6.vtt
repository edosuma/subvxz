<i>Working at Sacred Heart,</i>
<i>you grow accustomed to a lot of things:</i>

00:04.640 --> 00:07.837
<i>Sickness, death, Ted's morning</i>
<i>self-affirmation ritual.</i>

00:07.920 --> 00:13.233
People are laughing with you.
People are laughing with you.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.550
<i>One thing Turk</i>
<i>couldn't get accustomed to</i>

00:15.640 --> 00:18.029
<i>was his wife being friends</i>
<i>with a psychiatrist.</i>

00:18.120 --> 00:21.715
- What do you want for lunch today?
- Baby, please, not in front of her.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.075
Why are you not comfortable around me?

00:24.160 --> 00:25.991
You can get in people's heads.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.231
Don't take this negatively,
but that makes you a devil woman.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.788
Who could imagine
what it's like in your head?

00:31.880 --> 00:33.836
<i>I'll take this one.</i>

00:37.960 --> 00:41.077
Hey. Welcome to Turk's head.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.594
You look really hot.

00:43.680 --> 00:46.399
Wait a second.
You're not a lesbian.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.913
I am in here.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.632
Yeah, me too.

00:54.440 --> 00:57.273
Damn it!
Molly, you're a shrink.

00:57.360 --> 01:00.033
Why is it my daydreams end
right before the sexy part?

01:00.120 --> 01:02.350
I don't know.
Maybe we should work on that...

01:02.440 --> 01:04.271
...together.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.477
- Damn it!
- Dude.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.039
Relax...

01:13.120 --> 01:14.872
...and enjoy hot chocolate love.

01:18.360 --> 01:20.828
<i>Snap out of it!</i>
<i>Abort! Abort!</i>

01:22.440 --> 01:25.591
Stop it! I don't have gay jungle fever!

01:25.680 --> 01:27.636
- OK, we should go.
- Yeah.

01:29.760 --> 01:33.878
- Mr Garcia's family's here.
- Fantastic.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.997
<i>Telling a family</i>
<i>their loved one has died is never easy.</i>

01:37.080 --> 01:40.755
<i>That's why doctors have a variety</i>
<i>of techniques for breaking the news.</i>

01:40.840 --> 01:43.229
<i>There's the hand on shoulder.</i>

01:43.320 --> 01:45.834
<i>There's hand on hand.</i>

01:47.800 --> 01:51.475
<i>And, of course, the always popular</i>
<i>resident kabuki theatre.</i>

01:58.520 --> 02:00.511
I'm sorry for your loss.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.917
<i>As for my family, we had</i>
<i>our own way of breaking the news.</i>

02:06.000 --> 02:07.399
Hey, little brother.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.436
<i>We did it with cake.</i>
What happened?

02:09.520 --> 02:14.196
A guy can't travel 800 miles on a bus
with a cake to say, "How're things"?

02:14.280 --> 02:15.554
Dan.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.559
Dad died.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.273
There's ice cream in the fridge.

02:44.480 --> 02:45.913
You guys are back.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.231
Sorry I had to blow out of there
after the funeral. How was the week?

02:49.320 --> 02:51.550
Spent most time
dealing with the headstone.

02:51.640 --> 02:55.315
Dad was an office supplies salesman,
he wanted it shaped like a pencil.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.675
- So?
- It looked like a giant marble penis,

02:57.760 --> 02:59.830
which Dad would've liked more.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.717
How you doin', buddy?

03:01.800 --> 03:03.836
I don't know.
It hasn't hit me yet.

03:03.920 --> 03:08.311
It will eventually. Don't worry.
When it does, big bro will be there.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.038
- What is it?
- Dan, I love you,

03:10.120 --> 03:12.554
but being there for people
isn't your thing.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.189
No, that was the old Dan.
Look at me. This is new Dan.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.918
I'm totally here for you.

03:20.520 --> 03:23.876
Dan, you've been in here for,
like, nine hours. Are you OK?

03:23.960 --> 03:27.032
I'd feel better if you could give
that "H" knob a little twist.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.678
Body temp is a bit low.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.679
Now I can feel my tootsies.

03:39.280 --> 03:42.033
So, what do you think
of the new convertible, Ted?

03:42.120 --> 03:45.192
Why don't I have one of these?

03:45.280 --> 03:47.794
Well, howdy, Dr Kelso.
Ain't she a beaut?

03:47.880 --> 03:50.792
I rented 'er so's I could repair
the air conditioning unit.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.836
Looks expensive.
Who authorised this?

03:52.920 --> 03:55.593
Why, you did, sir.
Must've been Tuesday last.

03:55.680 --> 03:59.036
Stop talkin' like a farmer.
I did no such thing!

03:59.120 --> 04:03.159
I'm not sure how one would go about
making a janitor's life more miserable,

04:03.240 --> 04:07.631
but what say we start by docking your
pay for the cost of this monstrosity?

04:09.760 --> 04:11.318
Oh, God!

04:11.400 --> 04:13.391
It won't smooth down!

04:17.640 --> 04:19.709
It's nice to meet you too, Chuck.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.360
Oh. He's having one
of his <i>Love Connection</i> dreams.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.668
You sure?

04:23.760 --> 04:26.672
I'd love to go out with her again
if you'll pay for it.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.115
- Poppy.
- What?

04:29.200 --> 04:30.997
We've been looking all over for you.

04:31.080 --> 04:32.195
Why? What did I miss?

04:33.720 --> 04:36.314
Bye, Carla. Sorry I didn't
get to meet your husband.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.949
Mr Woolery, what've you been doing
since <i>Love Connection</i> was cancelled?

04:40.040 --> 04:43.589
<i>Love Connection</i> was never cancelled.
It's just not on TV anymore.

04:43.680 --> 04:48.595
I still do episodes in my basement
with singles from the neighbourhood.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.069
- I'm not crazy.
- No.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.991
Aw, stupid nap!

04:53.080 --> 04:55.594
I've been a little sleepy
these last couple of weeks.

04:55.680 --> 04:58.877
I've dropped a few pounds. I don't know.
I think I got the flu, baby.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.313
- No!
- Yeah.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.960
You're not allowed to get sick.
You're my superman.

05:03.040 --> 05:06.953
I mean, if you're in bed,
who's gonna give me my back rubs

05:07.040 --> 05:09.190
or unscrew
the peanut butter jar, or...

05:09.280 --> 05:12.955
...walk around all day in my new
high heels just to stretch them out?

05:13.040 --> 05:15.270
She's kidding.
I've never done that.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.351
Not in front of the devil woman.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.078
Sorry.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.558
- I got a new pair of pumps.
- No.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.835
<i>Whenever</i>
<i>someone close to you dies,</i>

05:26.920 --> 05:29.639
<i>it's important to keep</i>
<i>your head above water.</i>

05:30.120 --> 05:31.599
Dan!

05:32.240 --> 05:34.151
I'm up!

05:34.240 --> 05:37.073
It wasn't exactly easy
showering with you in there.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.230
It wasn't exactly easy for me,
either.

05:39.320 --> 05:40.548
You have Dad's butt.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.596
You think you'll get out
of the tub today?

05:42.680 --> 05:44.591
Today doesn't look good.
Get me beer?

05:44.680 --> 05:47.319
Look, I put a six-pack
for you in the toilet.

05:48.760 --> 05:51.149
- I gotta go to work.
- OK, little brother.

05:51.240 --> 05:55.711
Call me if you need... anything. I mean,
anything from this particular area.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.358
Hello, my old friend.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.634
Success.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.198
Look, Mr Cannon,
let's drop the forgetful act!

06:06.280 --> 06:09.795
Now, if you don't sign these papers,
this hospital will discharge you,

06:09.880 --> 06:12.599
and then we'll see what you do
and do not remember!

06:12.680 --> 06:15.513
The man has Alzheimer's, bozo.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.830
It still won't smooth down!

06:17.920 --> 06:20.559
He's not a day over 55,
and he has Alzheimer's.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.835
Really makes you think, doesn't it?

06:22.920 --> 06:24.751
You're over 55,
aren't you, sir?

06:24.840 --> 06:28.230
- What's your point?
- Nothin'.

06:28.320 --> 06:31.312
<i>Though I deal with death</i>
<i>every time I walk into this place,</i>

06:31.400 --> 06:33.630
<i>I'd never dealt with it from this side.</i>

06:34.560 --> 06:38.633
<i>It's full of surprises, whether it's</i>
<i>a small gesture from a co-worker...</i>

06:42.240 --> 06:44.629
<i>... or a big gesture from</i>
<i>someone you've never met.</i>

06:44.720 --> 06:46.756
Walk tall, kiddo.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.589
<i>Of course, sometimes it's a little</i>
<i>awkward, even with an old friend.</i>

06:53.600 --> 06:56.398
- I just wanted to...
- Yeah.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.754
- Look...
- Thanks.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.558
- 'K.
- 'K.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.717
Say, Barbie,
for a second there,

07:03.800 --> 07:07.429
I thought you were being a little cold,
but then you saved it with the...

07:07.520 --> 07:09.476
"'K."

07:09.560 --> 07:12.028
What are you gonna do,
hide, then call him Ginger?

07:12.120 --> 07:14.873
No. It's Monday, which,
of course, means it's ethnic day,

07:14.960 --> 07:17.554
so I'll be going with Rosalita.
Besides, I have a plan.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.596
- Which is?
- Yeah, unfortunately,

07:19.680 --> 07:22.911
the first part of the plan is not
to share it with people who annoy me.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.797
Want to hear the second part?

07:24.880 --> 07:26.313
- Sure.
- I can't.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.550
My hands are tied by the first part.

07:32.440 --> 07:35.318
Baby, look at you.
Please go see our doctor.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.391
I hate Dr Kim.

07:37.480 --> 07:41.712
He always makes me take my pants off,
even that time I went in for pink eye.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.074
I gotta pee.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.913
Don't you think it's weird
you've gone seven times today?

07:46.040 --> 07:48.679
I think it's weird you're counting.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.149
It's impossible to get
a doctor to see a doctor.

07:51.240 --> 07:52.992
I'm on it.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.439
Excuse me.

07:56.520 --> 08:00.911
Did somebody say they're lookin'
for the baddest detective in town?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.513
Awesome afro.

08:02.600 --> 08:07.230
I'm sorry to barge in on you, but
I was wondering if you could help me.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.869
I have this patient, constantly tired,
always peeing, losing weight.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.679
You should have him checked out.
He might have diabetes.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.395
The good news is that
it's Type 2 diabetes.

08:20.480 --> 08:23.278
It's still serious,
but it's totally manageable.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.354
Devil woman gave me diabetes.

08:29.600 --> 08:33.070
- How you holdin' up, Bambi?
- I'm OK. You have my charts?

08:33.159 --> 08:36.674
Didn't anyone tell you? They switched
your shift. You're off today.

08:37.919 --> 08:39.511
OK.

08:42.559 --> 08:44.596
- He bought it.
- Great, great, great.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.113
I took all his patients

08:46.200 --> 08:50.239
and I threatened his residents
under penalty of death not to page him.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.959
One last thing left to do.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.589
What is this?

08:58.680 --> 09:03.071
Basic homemade anti-drowning device
to be worn till your brother returns.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.037
- I like it.
- Oh, boy.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.352
Tryin' to cut back.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.231
Where the hell is my car?

09:12.320 --> 09:14.834
I parked it right there.
I know I parked it.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.868
For God's sake,
am I losing my mind?

09:24.320 --> 09:26.675
What the hell?

09:26.760 --> 09:29.115
Tommy! Take me up!
He's comin' back!

09:40.480 --> 09:43.278
- Hey, you want a beer?
- Absotively.

09:45.720 --> 09:46.869
Bath water.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.192
Backwash.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.914
- There you go.
- Oh, thank you.

09:57.800 --> 10:01.998
Hey, Dan, if Dad were here right now,
what would you say to him?

10:02.080 --> 10:04.230
I think he'd be glad to hear that.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.118
<i>Maybe it was</i>
<i>because I finally slowed down.</i>

10:07.200 --> 10:11.159
<i>Maybe it was remembering</i>
<i>Dad's passion for bodily functions.</i>

10:11.240 --> 10:13.549
<i>But at that moment, it all hit me.</i>

10:13.640 --> 10:16.837
<i>Unfortunately, I'm not sure</i>
<i>Dan's the guy to talk about it with.</i>

10:16.920 --> 10:20.959
Slow down, little duck.
Some ducks can't hold their water.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.510
It's OK. I know.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.876
<i>There's a lot in life</i>
<i>that can let you down.</i>

10:29.840 --> 10:31.273
<i>It can be your mind...</i>

10:36.280 --> 10:38.919
- <i>... or your body.</i>
- Call me if you have any questions.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.436
- I'm here for my ear infection.
- Go in and take your pants off.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.233
So, what'd he say?

10:46.320 --> 10:48.880
Oh, it's the flu, like I said.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.355
<i>Luckily for me,</i>
<i>I had someone to lean on.</i>

10:53.440 --> 10:55.192
Can I talk to you for a second?

10:55.280 --> 10:56.429
- Nope.
- Really?

10:56.520 --> 10:58.397
Not even two seconds to talk to me?

10:59.160 --> 11:02.596
Look, newbie... Oh, for God's sake.
I'm a little swamped. Thank you.

11:02.680 --> 11:06.559
You know what sucks? I thought
you were gonna come through for me.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.829
In a minute. Hey, Newbie,
just in case you didn't actually notice,

11:10.920 --> 11:14.037
I have been covering all your patients,
answering all your pages

11:14.120 --> 11:17.510
and doing everything shy of picking up
your sundress from the cleaners.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.875
Well, I didn't ask you
to do any of that, did I?

11:19.960 --> 11:24.431
Outstanding! You're walkin' away like
a pissy little ingrate. I mean, bravo!

11:24.520 --> 11:26.238
Bravo, huh?

11:29.320 --> 11:31.311
What are we clappin' for?

11:31.400 --> 11:33.391
His dad just died.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.519
Damn it.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.071
Why are you still antagonising him?

11:46.160 --> 11:48.913
I don't know.
I can't stop.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.309
You'd better come through for him.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.753
What do you want me to do?

11:52.840 --> 11:54.990
Be more sensitive.
Try giving him a hug.

11:55.080 --> 11:59.073
Barbie, you've met me before. Yes?

11:59.160 --> 12:01.435
Now, at most,
I can muster one hug a year.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.795
And nine months ago,
I hugged my son,

12:03.880 --> 12:06.110
so you're gonna have to do it.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.033
You saw us before?
We're still awkward from the break-up.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.951
Hold the phone.
Are you suggesting

12:11.040 --> 12:14.669
that if I sleep with him that I won't
have to deal with problems like this?

12:14.760 --> 12:16.830
I'm considering taking that hit.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.070
Honestly,
what is he like in post-game?

12:19.160 --> 12:22.118
Is there spooning? Because
I don't spoon. I'm not a spooner.

12:22.200 --> 12:26.830
Well, it took a whole tube of gel,
but I finally got my hair down.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.469
No one, male or female,
ever cared, Ted.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.949
Where the hell
are my reading glasses?

12:33.040 --> 12:36.237
The last few days,
I'm beginning to feel the old noodle

12:36.320 --> 12:37.878
is really letting me down.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.118
I'm sure I'm just
making mountains out of molehills.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.519
Don't you think, Ted?

12:48.800 --> 12:49.835
Ted?

12:49.920 --> 12:51.911
Hey, Wonderbra.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.671
Do you have a second?

12:54.760 --> 12:58.309
- For what?
- I'm giving you a hug.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.231
I was wonderin'
what that crane was for.

13:04.320 --> 13:07.517
So, now, how would you like
this whole hug thing to go down?

13:07.600 --> 13:09.591
Do you want to remain seated?

13:09.680 --> 13:13.036
As long as it's under three seconds
and I don't feel breath on my neck.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.157
You're making fun of me
cos I need help getting through this.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.639
No, I'm really trying.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.076
You know what? I'm sick of getting
dumped on, and I am sick of you.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.953
- Newbie, don't shove me.
- Oh, really? Why not?

13:27.040 --> 13:30.953
Because whenever anybody
shoves me more than twice,

13:31.040 --> 13:34.476
my mind goes blank, and all I see
is this white-hot flash of fury.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.551
When someone shoves you like this?

13:38.080 --> 13:40.389
- So? How'd it go?
- Punched him in the face.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.792
You want me to kick his ass?

13:44.880 --> 13:48.077
No need. I already
got him back and then some.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.475
- On the window, huh?
- Yeah!

13:56.360 --> 13:58.237
Here we go.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.118
- Oh, God. Who died?
- No. It's for Turk.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.237
- I'll get you some milk?
- Yeah!

14:04.320 --> 14:05.799
What's the occasion?

14:08.040 --> 14:10.554
I have Type 2 diabetes.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.631
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:12.720 --> 14:17.157
That sucks. Carla is aware if you eat
that, your foot will fall off, right?

14:17.240 --> 14:18.832
I haven't told her yet.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.559
I'm sure she knows cos
she's trying to get me to fess up

14:21.640 --> 14:24.632
by tempting her chocolaty goodness
with chocolaty goodness.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.553
Babe, do you want
some hot fudge sugar sauce?

14:27.640 --> 14:29.631
Oh, hell, yeah!

14:29.720 --> 14:32.109
- Why haven't you told her?
- I'm not sure.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.156
Can I tell you something weird?

14:34.240 --> 14:36.435
You can tell me anything.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.159
Your dad dying
has stolen my diabetes' thunder.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.231
My God!
Just this second I was thinking

14:41.320 --> 14:44.278
your diabetes is gonna get
in the way of my dad dying.

14:44.360 --> 14:45.713
Isn't that funny?

14:45.800 --> 14:47.358
Cool!

14:47.440 --> 14:49.192
I smell cake.

14:49.280 --> 14:53.910
If Uncle Bertie died, someone's
gonna have to go on a beer run.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.712
Thanks again for inviting me
to your house for dinner.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.028
I did?

15:09.440 --> 15:10.793
Yes, sir, you did.

15:16.960 --> 15:21.556
- Hey, where's your brother?
- JD!

15:23.880 --> 15:26.917
- He's not here.
- Look, Dan...

15:27.000 --> 15:28.911
It's Captain Bubblebeard.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.959
Avast, matey! Shut your scupper
and bury your steel!

15:33.040 --> 15:36.510
We should be seen...

15:36.600 --> 15:38.477
Now you're Dan again.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.633
Let's break down
the kid's support system.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.792
He's got me,
an emotionally crippled narcissist,

15:45.880 --> 15:49.793
and he's got you,
an emotionally crippled narcissist

15:49.880 --> 15:54.271
who's soaking in a tub of what by now
has to be mostly your own urine.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.351
I believe the ratio's shifted that way.

15:56.440 --> 16:01.150
And I have got to believe that
the two of us together, together, Dan,

16:01.240 --> 16:05.199
we can make it at least halfway
to one legitimate adult.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.952
You're right, Coxy.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.793
Damn it, Coxsmith,
crybaby time is over.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.598
The kid needs us,
and he needs us now.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.832
- Towel.
- Thank you. Let's rock'n'roll.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.115
I may have lost
some muscle mass in my legs.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.679
Fantastic.

16:19.760 --> 16:24.276
I want to apologise to you
for that whole "devil woman" thing.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.635
I promise you I will never
call you that again.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.757
It's OK. I can understand
why you're uncomfortable around me.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.831
I sometimes do see
everyone as a patient.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.639
You know, surgeons do that too.

16:34.720 --> 16:37.029
Come on,
let's see who's better at it.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.031
Hip replacement.

16:40.440 --> 16:43.113
- Alcoholic. That was easy.
- Yeah.

16:43.200 --> 16:46.033
Quadruple bypass,
two on me.

16:46.120 --> 16:49.635
Trying to validate herself,
so she'll sleep with anyone.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.472
Hey, Turk.

16:51.560 --> 16:54.438
What's up, Charice? All right?

16:54.520 --> 16:57.318
See, that was before Carla.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.391
So, what about me?

17:00.680 --> 17:02.636
Come on,
you know you want to.

17:04.359 --> 17:07.113
Well, Carla calls you her superman,
and you love that.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.156
The diabetes
makes you feel vulnerable,

17:09.240 --> 17:11.549
and you're afraid
if you're open to her about it,

17:11.640 --> 17:13.436
you won't be
her superman anymore.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.997
Yeah.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.991
Devil woman.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.198
Sorry.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.549
My God. I'm sorry
about the "wash me" thing!

17:26.640 --> 17:28.392
Put that on.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.790
Dan? You were out with him?
I thought you dissolved.

17:31.880 --> 17:36.715
This is the way to do this
without feeling uncomfortable. Drink.

17:39.680 --> 17:42.433
- Now talk.
- What do you want me to talk about?

17:42.520 --> 17:44.909
The pros and cons of
blitzing a weak side corner

17:45.000 --> 17:46.433
in third and long situations?

17:46.520 --> 17:49.671
<i>Thank you,</i>
Football for Dummies.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.514
I gotta tell you, little brother,
you were always the apple of Dad's eye.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.195
That's the worst thing about college
football. The male cheerleaders...

17:57.280 --> 17:58.872
That's a chick.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.515
When my father died,
all I could focus on

18:02.600 --> 18:05.239
was how much he was never there,
but you, you're lucky.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.595
You got some positive stuff
you can dwell on.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.671
Throw the ball, you jackass.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.716
He is a jackass.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.872
I mean, I met your father.
I remember like it was yesterday.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.918
After about two seconds,
I could tell how proud he was of you.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.434
<i>Then I heard something</i>
<i>I never thought I'd hear.</i>

18:20.520 --> 18:23.080
Truth be told there, Newbie...

18:23.160 --> 18:25.151
...l'm proud of you.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.759
Me too.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.352
<i>It's amazing how a few simple words</i>
<i>can change everything.</i>

18:36.440 --> 18:37.839
<i>Whether it's an apology...</i>

18:37.920 --> 18:43.040
I'm sorry I came down so hard on you.
I've been a bit forgetful lately.

18:43.120 --> 18:47.159
I suppose it's possible that I could've
told you you could rent that crane.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.630
Sir...

18:51.720 --> 18:53.438
...apology accepted.

18:54.680 --> 18:57.956
Hey! Tommy,
what are you doing?!

18:58.040 --> 19:00.918
Tommy's been let go.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.753
Have a nice weekend.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.070
You too, sir.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.833
<i>... or an admission.</i>

19:10.920 --> 19:14.230
- Baby, I got diabetes.
- Oh, no, Turk, really?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.675
Carla...

19:16.760 --> 19:19.069
I call this Turk's diabetes box.

19:19.160 --> 19:22.516
Here is a recipe
for sugar-free brownies.

19:22.600 --> 19:26.639
OK, here's a bunch of articles
I downloaded off of the Inter...

19:28.440 --> 19:31.193
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:31.280 --> 19:34.033
<i>Of course, sometimes</i>
<i>it's not about the words.</i>

19:34.120 --> 19:37.078
<i>It's just about having</i>
<i>someone there to listen.</i>

19:37.160 --> 19:40.835
Our dad is ranting and raving
cos he's an office supply salesman,

19:40.920 --> 19:43.388
and he can't find a paperclip
in the entire house.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.118
He gets to work the next morning,

19:45.200 --> 19:48.078
realises he's got a million of them
in the trunk of his car.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.958
The trunk is filled with boxes of them.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.270
Here's to your dad.
