00:01.251 --> 00:03.795
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:04.295 --> 00:05.255
Goodbye, Phil.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.215
My good friend.

00:10.593 --> 00:11.928
-(shouting)
-That's enough.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.431
-Quit it, get off.
-(groans)

00:14.514 --> 00:17.434
All right, that's it. One prisoner
at a time goes out to the bus.

00:17.517 --> 00:18.685
How do you like it so far?

00:19.227 --> 00:20.687
Can't get enough of it. (chuckles)

00:20.770 --> 00:22.439
Where are you going, hair bag?

00:22.522 --> 00:25.108
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:25.191 --> 00:27.360
It's misapplied manpower.

00:27.444 --> 00:31.448
The chief wants to help Ozzie
make good on a campaign promise.

00:31.531 --> 00:32.615
I don't make policy.

00:32.699 --> 00:35.702
You don't think the press should question
a PR stunt like Operation Stop 'N' Cop?

00:35.785 --> 00:37.746
Uh... No comment.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.873
You have hurt me, Frank.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.499
And you're going to pay for it.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.421
(chattering)

00:46.504 --> 00:50.633
Okay, item 11,
memo from building maintenance.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.303
Guys, I'm not going to make
a big deal out of this.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.972
Now, the memo says
that they found that some detergent

00:56.056 --> 00:58.725
they've been using
on toilet seats, etcetera,

00:59.517 --> 01:02.562
make cause skin rashes
on certain sensitive skin.

01:02.645 --> 01:05.648
So if anybody's been having skin rashes
on those general areas.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.817
Yeah, Renko, but he doesn't have
any skin that's sensitive.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.694
(laughter)

01:09.778 --> 01:12.864
Maybe don't worry. Or maybe worry.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.658
Item 12, Stop 'N' Cop blocks.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.578
That's Dekker between 118th and 120th.

01:18.661 --> 01:22.332
An operation against these
drug supermarkets begins today.

01:22.415 --> 01:25.168
And I guess lasts
until Mayor Cleveland decides

01:25.251 --> 01:27.003
that he's covered his campaign promise.

01:27.253 --> 01:31.549
First target will be the catchily named
Sexy Clothes Boutique...

01:31.633 --> 01:33.176
-(men whooping)
-...which was picked on the basis

01:33.259 --> 01:35.178
it has the lamest front.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.556
Last surveillance offered
one moth-eaten housedress

01:38.640 --> 01:41.017
-hung on a rack in the front room.
-(snickering)

01:41.101 --> 01:43.520
We got Detectives LaRue,
Washington, Belker,

01:43.603 --> 01:48.358
Furtias, Katz, and Lieutenant Goldblume
on this observation and bust stakeout.

01:49.150 --> 01:52.070
All backups will be posted upstairs.

01:52.153 --> 01:58.243
Item 13, Lieutenant Hunter will be taking
applications for the equestrian unit.

01:58.326 --> 02:01.830
As of May 1, this precinct
will have four horses.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.374
-(snickering)
-Which I guess means four horsemen.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.294
Last item, new partners.

02:08.878 --> 02:12.257
We got the transfer of Officers Peyser,
Rolf and Donahue to nights,

02:12.340 --> 02:14.801
so that makes the following reassignments
absolutely necessary.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.803
Richardson,
you'll be partnered with Conroy.

02:17.470 --> 02:20.056
Coffey with Pilsky.
And those will be till further notice.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.851
-Okay, that's about it.
-(chattering)

02:22.934 --> 02:25.061
LUCY: Hey, hey, wait a second, everybody.

02:25.812 --> 02:30.108
For the last ten days, I mean,
since I started doing roll calls, I...

02:31.317 --> 02:32.694
I feel like when I get to the end
of these things

02:32.777 --> 02:35.071
I'm like walking on eggshells. I...

02:36.156 --> 02:37.532
I don't know how to end them. I mean--

02:37.615 --> 02:39.784
The first one I wanted
to end the way the sarge did.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.412
Anyway, I guess we got
off to the wrong start.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.332
Well, I miss it.
I mean, I miss hearing those words.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.419
And I think maybe
some other people miss it, too, so...

02:51.171 --> 02:53.089
if there are no objections,

02:53.756 --> 02:55.925
I mean, I know I'm not the sarge.
I can never be the sarge.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.510
I'm-I'm roll call sergeant.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.262
Are there any objections?

03:01.723 --> 03:04.184
Okay, then let's roll.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.436
(cheering)

03:07.353 --> 03:08.563
And let's be careful out there.

03:08.646 --> 03:10.773
(cheering)

03:13.026 --> 03:14.360
Come on, move!

03:16.821 --> 03:19.365
-MAN: Good morning.
-(indistinct chattering)

03:19.449 --> 03:20.283
Belker.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.535
Move!

03:22.619 --> 03:25.747
-Hill, Renko. Homicide.
-MICK: Come on, hair bag.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.124
The alley behind Van Buren and Duluth.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.167
All right, thanks, Lieutenant.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.212
Uh-huh. Yeah, and does it have a sunroof?

03:33.796 --> 03:35.632
No, that's-- I ordered it though.

03:36.674 --> 03:38.468
Okay, it'll be, uh, a credit union check.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.137
Okay. (chuckles) Thanks a lot. Bye.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.225
Socking the salary boost
in the vehicular transport, Sergeant?

03:45.308 --> 03:47.852
Yeah, this is my first new car. (chuckles)

03:47.936 --> 03:49.062
-Good for you.
-Thanks.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.814
(sighs) Have lunch with me today.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.191
-Really? Lunch?
-Mm.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.150
I...

03:54.817 --> 03:58.154
Yeah, to celebrate, uh,
with an afternoon repast.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.197
Well...

04:01.574 --> 04:03.409
I thought it was a vacuum cleaner,
that's all.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.827
A vacuum cleaner?

04:05.370 --> 04:09.832
It says right here, Vetrocom International
Telecommunication System.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.376
You know what I think this is?

04:11.459 --> 04:14.295
This is a piece of phone company
space satellite, hair ball.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.005
You could be in all kinds of trouble.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.132
Never have nothing but trouble
with the phone company.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.760
(phone rings)

04:20.843 --> 04:21.928
Belker.

04:23.513 --> 04:24.347
Hi, Ma.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.268
You found my <i>Rin Tin Tin</i> lunch pail?

04:28.643 --> 04:29.811
Are you kidding?

04:30.895 --> 04:31.771
Yeah.

04:32.438 --> 04:33.648
Just a second, Ma.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.068
How would you like a crushed vertebrae?

04:39.821 --> 04:41.948
That's real nice, Ma.
You know what you should do?

04:42.031 --> 04:45.576
Give it to little, uh, Stevie.
The kid down the hall.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.578
No.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.289
No.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.583
Because I just use a bag now.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.128
Ma, I'm in a hurry here.

04:56.629 --> 04:57.964
I'm sure I don't need it.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.340
Give it to the little kid.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.970
I love you, too. Goodbye.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.350
-Name?
-What's a Rin Tin?

05:09.892 --> 05:12.103
It's a television show. <i>Rin Tin Tin.</i>

05:12.478 --> 05:14.188
Used to watch it when I was a kid.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.901
My mom just found my Riny lunch box.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.738
Maybe if I'd had a Riny lunch box
when I was a kid

05:21.821 --> 05:24.240
-things would be different.
-Maybe.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.659
Things I could have boosted
with something like that.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.578
(growls)

05:28.911 --> 05:31.497
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:31.581 --> 05:33.207
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:33.291 --> 05:37.211
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:37.295 --> 05:39.005
(sirens wailing)

05:44.427 --> 05:48.181
(theme music playing)

06:45.613 --> 06:48.449
(siren wailing)

07:12.348 --> 07:13.724
Any of you people see anything?

07:15.393 --> 07:16.602
Anybody see the stabbing?

07:16.936 --> 07:18.688
Yes, sir, I saw it all.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.524
Now what'd you see there, old fella?

07:21.941 --> 07:24.318
It was the older one, Willie Boy.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.528
Older of whom, sir?

07:25.611 --> 07:27.864
Of these hellfire brothers.

07:27.947 --> 07:32.034
I don't know their last name,
but Willie Boy stabbed that man.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.120
I saw it from my window up there.

07:34.787 --> 07:37.790
They argued, then Willie Boy stabbed him.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.461
I've been living in that apartment
for 32 years.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.379
-Uh, mister...
-Talbot.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.299
Mr. Lionel "Train" Talbot.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.509
Mr. Talbot, would you be willing
to come down to the station

07:48.593 --> 07:49.719
and check through some pictures?

07:49.802 --> 07:52.972
I'll identify and I'll give a statement.

07:53.055 --> 07:58.311
Because I'm sick and tired of being scared
of Willie Boy, his brother,

07:58.394 --> 08:00.229
and the rest of these roughnecks.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.814
I'm calling a halt.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.816
Well, all right. Whoo-whoo, Lionel.

08:04.066 --> 08:04.901
BOBBY: Let's do it, sir.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.404
Don't joke with my name
till you know me better.

08:10.823 --> 08:15.495
Sixty percent of a shift's detectives
and we'll be lucky to make six arrests.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.413
Maybe 50 nickel bags.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.582
Obviously, we hoped
for better numbers than that.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.167
Well, unless you want
a turnstile operation,

08:21.250 --> 08:22.793
there aren't going to be
any better numbers.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.003
Then we'll live with those.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.380
Warren, quality busts take time.

08:26.797 --> 08:29.509
You have to document observation.
You try to arrest during commission--

08:29.592 --> 08:31.511
I know the criteria, Frank.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.054
It's what the chief wants.

08:33.137 --> 08:37.099
And if he weren't under the knife,
he'd tell you so himself.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.852
What the chief wants it to mend
some fences with Ozzie Cleveland.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.355
What he really wants
is his hemorrhoids hadn't come back.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.190
Frank...

08:45.775 --> 08:49.987
the chief wants to help Ozzie
make good on a campaign promise.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.864
I don't see the villains there.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.200
It's misapplied manpower.

08:54.283 --> 08:57.286
It's a PR stunt that puts my people
at risk and it erodes morale.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.872
And it gives a false impression
of our ability to deal with a problem.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.958
How many different ways
do you want it to be wrong?

09:02.792 --> 09:03.626
Yes?

09:04.252 --> 09:06.879
Oh, uh, excuse me,
Deputy Chief Briscoe, um...

09:06.963 --> 09:08.464
Please, don't leave on my account.
(chuckles)

09:09.048 --> 09:11.634
For the record, Frank,
Chief asked me to drive by there,

09:11.717 --> 09:13.636
the Stop 'N' Cop operation.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.472
I just didn't want you to think
I was going behind your back.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.974
As opposed to looking over my shoulder?

09:18.683 --> 09:21.394
Now that's in the job profile
for deputy chief.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.522
-Lieutenant.
-Sir.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.899
What can I do for you, Howard?

09:28.025 --> 09:33.072
Well, candidly, Frank, I was passing by,
and I overheard the exchange.

09:34.115 --> 09:34.991
And?

09:36.576 --> 09:40.746
Judas, Frank, I love it. I just--
I love to hear you chew out the suits.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.593
That's him.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.805
Mullins, William. Okay.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.266
Been messing with people
in my neighborhood

10:00.349 --> 10:02.226
as long as I can remember.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.562
Got a brother named Timothy.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.397
Both of them trash.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.984
They robbed me twice.
And I was too afraid to call.

10:10.651 --> 10:11.485
All right, sir.

10:12.028 --> 10:12.903
No more.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.449
Lionel Talbot says enough is enough.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.659
Sarge, we got a suspect
on the Van Buren homicide.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.536
Got an address off a two-week old bust.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.830
Okay, go pick him up.
I'll get you backups.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.957
I'll go with you.
I ain't afraid to face 'em.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.876
No, this job is our, pops.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.548
CLARA: The princess and the stallion.

10:33.966 --> 10:34.925
Who, us?

10:35.009 --> 10:37.928
Yeah, the Polish princess
and the Italian stallion.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.181
Yeah.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.558
(sighs)

10:43.434 --> 10:45.895
-Look, Clara, can I say something?
-Sure.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.025
You probably heard
a lot of Joe Coffey stories, uh...

10:52.109 --> 10:54.654
You figure I'm this way or that way.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.238
You hear a lot of things.

10:56.989 --> 11:00.076
Clara, I would like you and I
to start from zero.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.286
Because the kind of guy I am, it, uh...

11:03.204 --> 11:05.790
I feel right now I'm in the middle
of working that out.

11:06.832 --> 11:10.044
-Hey, we're going to start from scratch.
-Thanks.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.255
-Same goes for me.
-All right.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.804
'Cause, I don't know,
maybe you're gonna...

11:20.971 --> 11:23.057
hear some things, you know? Um...

11:24.767 --> 11:26.936
-About me and my last partner.
-Like what?

11:30.564 --> 11:32.566
Just some things we used to do.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.487
You and Danny Frank?

11:37.363 --> 11:39.115
What do you mean?
What-what kind of things you used to do?

11:40.241 --> 11:42.284
I mean-- what do you mean?

11:42.368 --> 11:44.495
-What kind of things you used to do?
-WOMAN (on radio): <i>Unit 2203, respond.</i>

11:44.578 --> 11:45.663
Yeah, 2203.

11:45.746 --> 11:50.543
<i>Unit 2203, backup 2202</i>
<i>on suspect arrest, 1663 East Utica.</i>

11:50.626 --> 11:52.420
Two-two-oh-three responding. Let's go.

11:58.175 --> 11:59.719
Clara, things like what?

11:59.802 --> 12:01.554
(camera clicking)

12:01.637 --> 12:04.390
J.D.: Great, great, we get stuck
in this roach palace

12:04.473 --> 12:06.642
to get Ozzie Cleveland some PR.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.936
Got to have sustained observation, J.D.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.896
Got to have documented transactions.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.565
I hate these things!

12:12.648 --> 12:15.276
Oh, hey, don't look into the lens,
Belker, it'll crack.

12:15.693 --> 12:20.239
Hey, if you want the bust to fly,
you got to show them getting high, man.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.450
-You there, Fay?
-(camera clicking continues)

12:23.451 --> 12:26.620
(sighs) I'm getting tired
of this damn machine.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.331
I know you're there.
Pick up the phone so we can talk.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.250
You hear me?

12:33.753 --> 12:36.338
And if you're not there,

12:36.422 --> 12:38.924
just please have the simple courtesy
to call me back.

12:39.717 --> 12:40.676
Damn machines.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.179
I always wondered about her.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.265
-Who
-Captain's ex.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.518
I always wondered what she was like.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.270
You've met Fay. You know what she's like.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.189
Well, sure. Sure.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.775
You've got the mind of a pig, LaRue.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.109
Hey, you got the breath of a goat, Belker.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.402
Hey, hey, come on, you guys.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.112
I think it's about time
we made some arrests.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.865
All right. About time
to get some fresh air.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.158
Got enough photos, Neal?

13:04.533 --> 13:06.535
You got Washington on the shutter, baby.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.246
All right, all units,
we're moving on targets. Let's go.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.041
(sirens wailing)

13:14.877 --> 13:16.629
MICK: Come on out from there! Come on!

13:16.712 --> 13:18.672
Assume the positions, dirt bags.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.342
HENRY: Unit 24, you're without charge
before questioning.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.093
-Freeze.
-MICK: Get your hands down.

13:23.844 --> 13:26.388
Hey, check this out, babe.
Ebony and ivory.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.640
(chuckles) They named one after us.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.809
-(chuckles)
-Hey, we've got you on film, babe.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.061
-You are busted.
-We're so advanced, we're simple.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.104
Now, you got the right to remain silent.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.397
You got the right-- Hey!

13:35.856 --> 13:38.609
-Coming at you, Mick!
-Where you going, hair bag?

13:39.485 --> 13:40.486
(groans)

13:41.904 --> 13:44.281
Oh, man, Foster just got cut bad.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.457
(music playing inside)

14:01.090 --> 14:03.175
-What's doing?
-You William Mullins?

14:04.426 --> 14:05.636
-Could be.
-Then you're doing...

14:05.719 --> 14:06.929
(shouting)

14:07.012 --> 14:08.556
-Hey, man!
-Get down!

14:08.639 --> 14:11.433
-(all shouting)
-Hey, don't move!

14:11.517 --> 14:14.228
-Hold it right there!
-WILLIAM: You got a warrant, man? Come on!

14:14.311 --> 14:15.813
Get him out of here
while we search the place.

14:15.896 --> 14:16.772
-Hey, take it is!
-Get out!

14:16.856 --> 14:19.525
Hey, pal, you take it easy or you're
going to take it hard, you hear me?

14:19.692 --> 14:20.568
Let's go.

14:26.031 --> 14:29.159
Leo, we got a Mr. Mullins
here for homicide.

14:29.243 --> 14:32.746
-Future pharmacists of America, Leo.
-LEO: All right. Slow. Slow.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.081
Take this gentleman, please.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.917
-Stop 'N' Cop?
-Yeah. We get a couple of lame busts

14:37.001 --> 14:39.420
and Foster gets cut up
like a Thanksgiving turkey.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.046
-Where did they take him?
-Mercy Hospital.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.465
-He's okay, Captain.
-Yeah, if you don't count blood loss.

14:43.924 --> 14:44.884
Come here, J.D.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.390
Look, J.D., I'm no fan of this operation,

14:51.473 --> 14:53.392
but bitching and moaning
won't help morale.

14:53.475 --> 14:54.393
I'm sorry, Captain, okay?

14:54.476 --> 14:57.313
I just don't like shilling
for Ozzie Cleveland's street games.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.023
You're entitled to your opinion,
but off duty, okay?

14:59.648 --> 15:01.275
-Got it.
-Who's taking the reins?

15:01.358 --> 15:04.236
Me and Neal. Furtias and Katz and Belker
are on a second stakeout.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.322
Oh, about morale, Captain, huh?

15:06.405 --> 15:07.740
Get in a room with Belker sometime.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.658
His breath is enough to crush your eyes.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.369
-Counselor.
-Pizza Man.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.495
(chuckles) How's your day going?

15:13.954 --> 15:15.915
-Nowhere close to my night.
-(chuckles)

15:16.206 --> 15:17.666
Dexter Sawyer, Captain Furillo.

15:17.750 --> 15:18.876
-Pleased to meet you, Captain.
-How are you?

15:19.376 --> 15:21.378
-Dexter just joined our office.
-Good.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.504
Cram orientation course.

15:22.588 --> 15:23.923
Who's in my future, Lieutenant?

15:24.006 --> 15:26.300
William Mullins. Homicide. Interrogation.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.010
Okay.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.386
(clears throat) Gentlemen.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.265
-Who's the kid?
-New PD.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.850
-I don't like him.
-(chuckles)

15:36.602 --> 15:39.647
If you don't mind, Mr. Sawyer's
going to listen to our discussion.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.734
All client-attorney privileges apply.

15:46.654 --> 15:50.074
-That means he's my lawyer, too?
-Yes.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.370
Okay.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.832
You've got an impressive list
of priors, Mr. Mullins.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.834
Armed robbery. Possession.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.295
Aggravated assault.
Assault with a deadly weapon.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.588
All multiple counts.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.590
Man does what he has to do.

16:06.882 --> 16:11.136
Presently, we're talking about homicide,
which puts you in a whole new tax bracket.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.429
That's if I'm guilty.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.306
Which who's to say?

16:16.308 --> 16:18.602
You're a suspect in the murder
of Cecil Gibbons.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.940
In a few minutes, a witness
is going to see if he recognizes you.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.358
So?

16:25.234 --> 16:26.902
He claims he saw you commit the crime.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.404
Says he can identify you.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.411
So I killed him, so what?

16:35.494 --> 16:37.037
Sucker challenged me.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.290
And the next fool that challenge me,
I'll ice him, too.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.003
So, Miss Lady, you just get me
back on the streets,

16:44.086 --> 16:47.256
you won't have to worry
about no witness or no charge.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.343
If you're identified in a lineup,

16:51.427 --> 16:53.762
you're not going to get
on the street, Mr. Mullins.

16:54.596 --> 16:57.182
Murder is a capital crime.
The judge will set a high bail.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.480
That's why a man has friends.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.775
HENRY: Get your heads up, gentlemen.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.194
Step to your left, number three.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.780
That's him. Number four.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.449
William Mullins. He stabbed him.

17:14.324 --> 17:17.202
Take your time, Mr. Talbot.
We want you to be absolutely sure.

17:17.286 --> 17:20.372
I don't need to take my time.
I know who killed Cecil Gibbons.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.958
It was number four, William Mullins.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.127
You want a profile?

17:26.086 --> 17:28.338
I'm as sure as I'm sitting here.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.133
HENRY: All right, that's it.
Move to the door.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.722
I'm looking for William Mullins.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.766
-He's unavailable.
-That's my brother.

17:40.684 --> 17:41.560
He's in a lineup.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.479
I guess you can take a seat
over there and wait.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.481
They should know what they're
gonna do with him in a few minutes.

17:45.564 --> 17:49.276
-RENKO: Where do I have to find...
-BOBBY: Mm, me too. Where to be?

17:50.152 --> 17:52.780
Bobby, public disturbance
in front of this guy's business.

17:52.863 --> 17:53.739
You and Renko check it out.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.491
Oh... We're about go to get
something to eat.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.034
Can't you give it to somebody else?

17:57.117 --> 17:58.160
No, I cannot.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.788
-How we rolling, brother?
-Hard.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.459
-Hey, pops.
-Hi, Officer.

18:06.001 --> 18:07.294
-Mr. Talbot.
-Yeah?

18:07.669 --> 18:10.506
My name is Joyce Davenport.
I'm representing William Mullins.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.674
This one case you're going to lose.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.344
I'd like to ask you some questions.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.013
I can't now
because I got to go to the clinic.

18:18.555 --> 18:20.974
I'd like to make it pretty soon
while your memory is still fresh.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.976
I ain't trying to duck you.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.854
Just got hypertension
and I got to go to the clinic.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.607
Now this is my address.
I should be home by 2:00.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.192
-Thank you, sir.
-Yo, Lionel.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.694
You the one said you seen me?
You ain't seen nothing, man!

18:32.778 --> 18:33.987
-You ain't seen me do nothing!
-JOYCE: Shut up.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.281
-Come on.
-You made a mistake, man!

18:36.365 --> 18:37.783
You the one made a mistake!

18:37.866 --> 18:39.243
-You liable to get iced!
-William!

18:39.326 --> 18:41.203
-William!
-You going to get cold real quick!

18:41.286 --> 18:43.122
I saw you when you stabbed that man.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.457
I did-- Hey, bro, he made a mistake!

18:45.541 --> 18:47.835
I ain't afraid of you or your brother.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.129
I seen you when you stabbed that man.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.214
Okay. Hey.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.466
Your brother's going to be charged.
You got any other business here?

18:54.550 --> 18:56.385
No, not here.

18:56.718 --> 18:57.803
Well, then take a hike.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.973
And don't even consider
intimidating anybody.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.307
You'll end up in a cell.

19:05.477 --> 19:09.398
(man singing loudly)

19:12.067 --> 19:14.111
You see what I mean?
He's been doing that all morning.

19:14.194 --> 19:18.323
-He's scaring all my customers away.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.169

How the hell would I know
anything about that?

20:30.562 --> 20:33.649
No, listen. All we got is the demon.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.609
Aw, he ain't got no Dr. Monster, man?

20:35.692 --> 20:37.236
I said we ain't got it, brother.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.030
Now get behind the demon. Demon delivers.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.282
-Oh, man, forget that.
-All good stuff, too, man.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.617
(groans)

20:44.868 --> 20:47.412
-Yes, sir?
-You got four tray bags, man, please?

20:47.496 --> 20:49.248
Step right to the door, my man.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.582
-(sniffing)
-They'll take care of you.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.167
You're willing to sell me some smack, huh?

20:52.251 --> 20:54.795
I ain't standing here
looking for a date, coo.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.922
Maybe you're looking to do some time!

20:57.005 --> 20:58.924
-A bust! Bust, man!
-Go, go!

21:01.343 --> 21:03.720
-Red Dog, you got three coming your way.
-(on radio) <i>Roger, Bulldog.</i>

21:03.804 --> 21:06.431
(siren wails)

21:08.934 --> 21:10.269
MICK: Police, freeze!

21:10.686 --> 21:12.896
(gunshots)

21:13.689 --> 21:14.856
(man groans)

21:24.408 --> 21:25.367
What are you doing here?

21:25.909 --> 21:27.369
Phone company wouldn't press charges.

21:27.452 --> 21:31.039
We got a shooting victim here,
435 North Polk.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.084
-Now look what the phone company--
-Shut up!

21:35.794 --> 21:37.296
You're not going to die on me.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.755
-(breathing heavily)
-You understand?

21:39.256 --> 21:41.049
-Logan.
-What?

21:41.466 --> 21:42.801
My name's Jim Logan.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.219
Camden, New Jersey.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.931
You call my mama. Sara Beth Logan.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.392
-Okay?
-No.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.894
No! No!

21:53.645 --> 21:55.564
Come back! Come back here!

21:56.064 --> 21:57.899
Don't do this to me!

21:59.818 --> 22:00.861
(grunts)

22:04.489 --> 22:07.367
The White Sheik is a weasel
and the Black Sheik is a fraud.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.078
And let me tell you another thing,
if he tries to put the claw on me,

22:10.162 --> 22:11.955
I'm going to rip off his arms
and beat him to death with it.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.082
Baron Von Himmel,
last time you met the Sheik

22:14.166 --> 22:16.168
it was war, it was chaos,
it was the worst thing

22:16.251 --> 22:17.586
that ever happened
in the history of wrestling.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.421
What have you got to say
about that tonight?

22:19.504 --> 22:21.506
Vinnie, I'm telling you,
the man hit me with a chair.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.050
I got no respect for this man for that.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.010
That's tonight, 8:30,
Municipal Auditorium.

22:25.093 --> 22:26.845
-He's mine!
-Baron Von Himmel versus the Sheik.

22:26.928 --> 22:29.348
The Leopard King
versus Jerry the Bulldog. Be there.

22:29.431 --> 22:32.434
-Ah!
-(laughing)

22:32.517 --> 22:34.770
-Are you guys going?
-Yeah, we're all going.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.230
-Joe, you going?
-Yeah, I'm going to take Sandy.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.066
-She's never been.
-Yeah. What a classy guy.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.484
Takes his girl to wrestling meets.

22:40.567 --> 22:43.570
-Hey, it's a broadening experience.
-Yeah, right. (laughs)

22:43.653 --> 22:45.447
Hey, you got any extra tickets?

22:45.989 --> 22:48.700
Uh, well, we got, what, six tickets.

22:48.784 --> 22:51.328
Yeah, but they're all, uh,
accounted for, Luce.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.580
You know, I bet you
could get some at the door.

22:53.663 --> 22:55.499
-I'm sure you can.
-Yeah. Yeah, you could.

22:55.582 --> 22:58.126
I sort of got plans anyway. Look I got...

22:58.210 --> 23:00.003
You want to check out this disturbance?
Dekker and 39th.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.755
Anything we can do
for the sarge. (mumbles)

23:01.838 --> 23:03.173
(laughs)

23:03.256 --> 23:05.801
-(shouts)
-(laughing)

23:05.884 --> 23:06.718
(shudders)

23:25.529 --> 23:27.906
Uh, Mrs. Sara Beth Logan, please.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.660
Mrs. Logan, my name is Michael Belker.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.995
I'm calling with reference
to your son James.

23:34.746 --> 23:39.084
I'm-- Yes. I'm afraid
James has been in an accident,

23:39.167 --> 23:40.752
and I'm afraid that he's dead.

23:44.631 --> 23:47.467
Uh, Mrs. Logan.

23:49.678 --> 23:54.349
I have some phone numbers with reference
to James' remains and so forth.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.184
Yes.

23:57.352 --> 24:01.440
I don't really know.
I-I-I don't really know all the details.

24:03.733 --> 24:04.693
No.

24:06.236 --> 24:09.739
No, my best information
is he wasn't doing anything wrong.

24:11.199 --> 24:14.077
He just got caught
in the switches, I believe.

24:14.161 --> 24:17.080
He got caught in some switches
and there was a shooting--

24:17.747 --> 24:20.041
That's right. That's absolutely right.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.918
They are unsafe to walk.

24:30.427 --> 24:33.221
Well, we were, uh,
I'd say we were friends.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.806
And he was doing all right.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.183
He always had something going, you know?

24:36.266 --> 24:37.767
At any rate, Mrs. Logan...

24:39.686 --> 24:44.107
I was with him and he said
to tell you that he loved you,

24:44.983 --> 24:47.861
and I'll-- I'll write you a letter

24:47.944 --> 24:51.072
and send you
the phone numbers and so forth.

24:51.573 --> 24:53.366
I'm very sorry for your loss.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.298
Back here. He won't talk or nothing.

25:08.381 --> 25:11.343
-All right, we'll take care of it, sir.
-(man singing)

25:11.426 --> 25:14.262
-Sounds like Vic Damone again, don't it?
-Yeah.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.183
Hey, bud. I thought I told you
to stop singing

25:18.266 --> 25:20.310
-or I was going to take you to jail.
-♪ <i>Lord done stabbed me, baby ♪</i>

25:21.186 --> 25:23.438
<i>♪ Lord done stabbed me, baby ♪</i>

25:24.147 --> 25:25.941
<i>♪ Lord done stabbed me, baby ♪</i>

25:26.024 --> 25:27.150
-RENKO: Hey, buddy.
-BOBBY: Come on, buddy.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.819
Let's help you up from there. Come on.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.613
(groans)

25:32.280 --> 25:34.366
Oh, my God. Call an ambulance right now!

25:34.449 --> 25:36.117
-Call them! Get on it!
-When did it happen?

25:36.910 --> 25:41.122
<i>♪ Must be 20 minutes ago now ♪</i>

25:41.206 --> 25:42.374
Hurry up!

25:42.707 --> 25:45.710
<i>♪ They stabbed me with a knife ♪</i>

25:48.713 --> 25:51.007
-(soft jazz music playing)
-This is nice, Lieutenant.

25:51.091 --> 25:54.469
-Oh, please. Call me Howard.
-Okay.

25:55.512 --> 25:58.557
I bet you're real excited
about your equestrian unit, huh?

25:58.640 --> 25:59.641
Oh, yeah.

26:00.308 --> 26:03.645
I find equine pulchritude unsurpassed.

26:04.062 --> 26:07.899
The grace of movement, the power,
and yet a delicacy that transcends size.

26:09.943 --> 26:13.238
Not at all unlike the characteristics
that I admire in yourself.

26:13.488 --> 26:14.406
(chuckles)

26:15.949 --> 26:17.909
Are you saying that I look like a horse?

26:17.993 --> 26:20.370
Well, only in the most
complimentary sense.

26:20.453 --> 26:24.833
That is, uh, I mean, there's a certain
evocation of the flowing mane,

26:24.916 --> 26:27.294
the deep breaths, the supple haunches.

26:27.752 --> 26:28.920
The haunches?

26:29.004 --> 26:30.505
(laughs)

26:30.589 --> 26:32.757
I'm not sure I'm making myself clear.

26:32.966 --> 26:35.176
Um, the point is...

26:36.177 --> 26:38.763
Damn it, Lucy, you interest me.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.099
I'm very flattered, Lieutenant.

26:41.349 --> 26:45.353
These past two months in therapy,
I've-I've come to realize

26:45.895 --> 26:48.481
that I'm ready to share my life.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.443
That I'm ready for a relationship.

26:51.693 --> 26:52.986
(laughs)

26:53.069 --> 26:55.572
I don't want to be isolated anymore.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.700
Well, Lieutenant, I don't know
where this is leading, but--

26:59.618 --> 27:00.702
You're a very nice man,

27:01.494 --> 27:04.956
but I should tell you
that I try to keep my social life

27:05.540 --> 27:07.667
and my work life separate.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.463
Well, that's-- (clears throat)

27:11.546 --> 27:13.965
That's, uh, probably very prudent.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.051
I think so. (chuckles)

27:16.134 --> 27:18.178
What I had in mind was entirely innocent.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.930
I mean, I have these two tickets
to the philharmonic's

27:21.014 --> 27:23.224
upcoming rendition of Mahler's Fourth.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.894
Kossakowski's conducting.

27:25.977 --> 27:28.063
Like I said, I can't.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.522
Well, if your taste
aren't to the classics,

27:29.606 --> 27:30.982
we-we could go to a movie.

27:32.942 --> 27:35.403
Lieutenant... (clears throat)
this is not something I made up.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.946
You know, I thought about this a long time

27:37.030 --> 27:38.948
and it's something I would like
to stick with, so...

27:40.700 --> 27:42.827
(clears throat)
Maybe we should just order, okay?

27:47.916 --> 27:48.750
Do you bowl?

27:50.085 --> 27:51.670
(laughs) Just kidding.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.088
(laughs)

27:58.885 --> 28:01.680
I heard a cop got cut
in that Stop 'N' Cop operation.

28:01.763 --> 28:02.722
Yeah, Foster.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.559
-Will he be okay?
-Yeah.

28:07.936 --> 28:08.978
(exhales)

28:10.855 --> 28:12.774
I'm getting as bad as you
worrying all the time.

28:13.733 --> 28:15.193
-What?
-Nothing.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.946
No, something's wrong. What is it?

28:20.532 --> 28:22.158
I think we shouldn't
see each other anymore.

28:22.242 --> 28:24.202
I think we should stop. I'm sorry.

28:25.954 --> 28:26.955
Are you serious?

28:28.289 --> 28:29.582
I'm very sorry.

28:33.336 --> 28:35.797
Mick, I-- I think
we ought to talk about it.

28:36.756 --> 28:38.967
Nope. It's got to be this way.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.260
Please, excuse me.

28:41.886 --> 28:44.389
-Mick.
-I've got to go, Robin.

28:47.559 --> 28:48.768
What are our choices, Captain?

28:48.852 --> 28:51.187
You treat us like three-year-olds
the moment you hit sanctuary.

28:51.271 --> 28:54.107
Now, let's pretend there's a line here
and let's not cross that line.

28:54.190 --> 28:56.901
This is a police precinct,
not a press room.

28:56.985 --> 29:00.321
You don't think the press should question
a PR stunt like Operation Stop 'N' Cop?

29:00.405 --> 29:02.365
Stunt? Maybe you should go over
to Mercy General.

29:02.866 --> 29:05.744
One of our stuntmen is being operated on
for a stab wound over there.

29:05.827 --> 29:09.497
Are you saying that a cop getting wounded
justifies any activity he's involved in?

29:09.581 --> 29:11.458
I'm saying everybody has a job to do.

29:11.541 --> 29:15.336
Part of yours may be to provoke a story
with cat and mouse word games.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.590
What's cat and mouse about questioning
the utility of Stop 'N' Cop?

29:18.673 --> 29:20.258
Because it's a question in a void.

29:20.341 --> 29:21.801
You want to solve the drug problem?

29:21.885 --> 29:24.846
Then legalize heroin
and dispense it on a controlled basis.

29:24.929 --> 29:27.515
Put a cop on every street corner,
and that's the end of your problem.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.851
But now you've narcotized
a portion of the population

29:29.934 --> 29:31.519
and what you do
is you risk a police state.

29:32.061 --> 29:33.521
What would you do, Captain?

29:35.607 --> 29:37.442
-I don't make policy.
-If you did?

29:40.028 --> 29:45.784
Maybe I'd pay less attention
to trenchant political concerns.

29:45.867 --> 29:48.453
And I just left a cop
who's going to be wearing a scar

29:48.536 --> 29:51.289
long after politicians
are onto other trendy issues.

29:51.372 --> 29:53.291
Do you include Mayor Cleveland
in that category?

29:53.374 --> 29:54.250
Well, uh...

29:55.835 --> 29:58.254
I think Mayor Cleveland is, uh,
probably doing his best

29:58.338 --> 30:01.299
to deliver on campaign promises
he made in good faith.

30:01.382 --> 30:03.384
Well, is that a yes or a no?

30:03.468 --> 30:05.929
No, uh, no comment.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.354
JUDGE: Okay, here's the deal, guys.

30:14.437 --> 30:16.147
Now your client Mr. Flores,

30:16.564 --> 30:18.733
now, because he's a seller,
I mean, he's gotta do time, right?

30:18.817 --> 30:20.193
All right, 90 days?

30:20.276 --> 30:23.154
Your client Mr. Gomez, he pleads,

30:23.238 --> 30:25.824
he gets probation
with a drug program. Okay?

30:26.157 --> 30:27.784
Ah-ha, the arresting officers.

30:27.867 --> 30:31.663
-Al?
-Please, detective, "Your Honor."

30:34.791 --> 30:35.708
Like my robes?

30:37.126 --> 30:40.213
Okay, fellas, um, give me a minute
with a couple of old trenchmen, huh?

30:40.797 --> 30:41.673
Tell your guys.

30:45.218 --> 30:47.095
(chuckles)

30:48.137 --> 30:50.932
This is kind of a surprise,
uh, Your Honor.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.726
I owe it all to this book, J.D.

30:55.895 --> 30:57.105
<i>The Brothers Karamazov.</i>

30:58.022 --> 31:00.608
You owe your job
to <i>The Brothers Karamazov?</i>

31:00.692 --> 31:02.902
No, not my job. My job I owe, of course,

31:02.986 --> 31:07.073
to eight years unstinting service
through psychic crisis

31:07.156 --> 31:09.701
and otherwise through the 23rd Ward
Democratic Committee.

31:09.784 --> 31:11.578
(inhales) But my method...

31:13.246 --> 31:17.375
Are-are you-- are you familiar
with the teaching of the Grand Inquisitor?

31:17.458 --> 31:19.419
(clicks tongue) Uh, not exactly.

31:21.212 --> 31:26.134
You see, men gabble
about freedoms and rights. Nah.

31:27.135 --> 31:30.054
In truth, they crave three things only:

31:31.890 --> 31:36.269
Miracle, mystery, and authority.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.439
All right, step back, detectives,
and watch a master jurist at work.

31:40.231 --> 31:42.942
Are these plea bargains
acceptable to your clients?

31:43.234 --> 31:46.154
-MR. FLORES: NG, Judge.
-JUDGE: NG, Mr. Flores.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.823
Gomez here gets a program.
Why do I got to do time?

31:48.907 --> 31:51.701
Uh, Judge, Mr. Gomez also has a problem.

31:51.784 --> 31:54.162
He says drug programs
don't really help him.

31:54.621 --> 31:58.750
He'd prefer probation
and he promises to quit drugs on his own.

31:59.292 --> 32:00.126
Oh, I see.

32:01.586 --> 32:04.047
(chuckles)

32:06.174 --> 32:07.258
Ingrates.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.511
Pipsqueaks.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.430
I'm a former public defender myself,

32:12.513 --> 32:15.475
and I am on to your heroin
guzzling zombie tricks.

32:15.558 --> 32:16.601
You know what I'm tempted to do?

32:16.684 --> 32:18.478
Hold you in contempt till you rot!

32:19.520 --> 32:21.689
I'll give you a good dose
of mace right now.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.442
Unfortunately, rule of law prevents me.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.238
-But I can find you guilty as charged.
-(gavel bangs)

32:29.322 --> 32:31.282
Mr. Gomez, 14 months.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.493
Mr. Flores, seven years.

32:33.576 --> 32:39.123
And believe me, sir, if I could...
I would throw the book at you.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.042
-Remand to custody.
-WOMAN: Your Honor.

32:41.125 --> 32:44.879
This is just an arraignment,
there hasn't been a trial.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.216
(chattering)

32:49.884 --> 32:51.594
(whispers) I know exactly what I'm doing.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.180
(whispers indistinct)

33:00.228 --> 33:03.731
-(normal voice) I'm just kidding.
-(laughs) Same old Al.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.484
Your Honor, my client feels
that the drug program

33:06.567 --> 33:09.654
originally offered him
is now in his best interest.

33:09.737 --> 33:12.824
Mr. Flores will take his 90 days.

33:13.700 --> 33:14.742
I am delighted.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.043
JOYCE: Here you go.

33:28.297 --> 33:31.050
-What a pit.
-It ain't the Ritz.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.520
Uh, excuse me,
the names are off the boxes.

33:42.603 --> 33:44.397
Which apartment is Lionel Talbot's?

33:44.772 --> 33:46.649
-Who're you from?
-We're public defenders.

33:46.733 --> 33:47.817
He's not in any trouble.

33:48.776 --> 33:51.779
Train lives first room to your left,
top of the stairs.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.281
-Thank you.
-Hmm.

33:57.952 --> 34:01.330
Uh, you know, uh, this isn't going to be
my most favorite part of the job.

34:01.414 --> 34:03.791
It isn't anyone's. You get used to it.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.418
When Mr. Talbot answers the door,

34:05.501 --> 34:08.254
I want you to verify
whether he's wearing his glasses or not.

34:08.546 --> 34:09.547
That's pretty cagey.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.550
(gunshots)

34:12.633 --> 34:14.135
(baby crying)

34:15.720 --> 34:17.221
-(cocks gun)
-I called the cops.

34:17.305 --> 34:18.431
Get the hell out of here!

34:19.557 --> 34:22.435
-(baby crying continues)
-(indistinct chatter on TV)

34:29.817 --> 34:32.403
(sirens wailing)

34:38.951 --> 34:40.953
HENRY: Either of you get a clear look?
Or you get a description?

34:41.037 --> 34:44.916
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I was just so afraid.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.250
JOYCE: He looked like the brother.

34:51.047 --> 34:53.549
-The brother of the man--
-Mullins? Timothy Mullins?

34:54.717 --> 34:56.052
Brother of William Mullins.

34:56.135 --> 34:58.179
Call it in. Get a picture.
Get a description out.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.680
He pointed the gun at me, I don't know.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.766
Somebody yelled. And I didn't know
if he was going to shoot.

35:01.849 --> 35:02.892
Joyce, it's all right.

35:02.975 --> 35:05.144
He was going to shoot,
and then he just ran away.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.241
Oh, Frank. (sobbing)

35:27.208 --> 35:30.419
Twenty-two-oh-three, Dekker and Reese
are clear. North on Dekker.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.968
Twenty-two-oh-two, King and 116th's clear.

35:37.301 --> 35:38.469
West on 116.

35:38.928 --> 35:40.888
-Wait a minute, Renko.
-No, no.

35:42.098 --> 35:43.391
West on 116.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.480
-2203.
-(siren wailing)

35:49.564 --> 35:51.732
Subject running west on Fredrick.
We're in pursuit.

35:59.490 --> 36:00.408
-Hold it!
-(grunts)

36:03.161 --> 36:04.036
(tire screeches)

36:04.120 --> 36:05.246
-(horn blares)
-Freeze!

36:08.124 --> 36:10.835
(siren wailing)

36:13.296 --> 36:15.548
Come on, up against the wall, creep.

36:16.090 --> 36:16.924
Come on, let's move it!

36:24.599 --> 36:25.600
Hey, we got Timothy Mullins.

36:25.683 --> 36:26.767
Hey! I want to talk to my brother.

36:26.851 --> 36:27.894
Leo!

36:27.977 --> 36:29.812
His brother's downstairs.
Keep him upstairs.

36:29.896 --> 36:32.315
LEO: Okay, Mr. Mullins. You have
the same address as your brother?

36:32.398 --> 36:34.400
TIMOTHY: Hey, I ain't saying nothing
till I see William.

36:34.483 --> 36:35.776
Put down that it is, Leo.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.404
RENKO: You ain't going to say nothing
at all in a minute.

36:38.487 --> 36:41.032
Hey, I didn't do nothing,
my brother done nothing!

36:43.743 --> 36:45.036
All the way to the end.

36:51.125 --> 36:52.376
Number four, stand up straight.

36:59.258 --> 37:00.134
I'm not sure.

37:05.514 --> 37:07.308
Turn to your right, please. Profile.

37:11.354 --> 37:13.689
I'm sorry, I can't make
a positive identification.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.524
We're not looking
for legal certainty here.

37:15.608 --> 37:18.736
I understand what you're looking for.
I can't be sure it's he.

37:18.819 --> 37:20.279
Which one aren't you sure of?

37:23.950 --> 37:24.867
Any of them.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.918
-Joyce.
-What?

37:34.460 --> 37:35.795
I couldn't be sure, Frank.

37:36.504 --> 37:39.548
Then you did the right thing.
But let me be sure I understand here.

37:39.632 --> 37:41.050
You mean you really couldn't identify him,

37:41.133 --> 37:43.219
or you're just distraught
and maybe we should try again tomorrow?

37:43.302 --> 37:45.554
What do you want me to say, Frank?
Is that what you want me to say?

37:45.638 --> 37:47.598
Mayor Cleveland's here, Captain.
He's in your office.

37:47.682 --> 37:48.599
I'll see you at home.

37:49.558 --> 37:51.143
She afraid the other brother's
going to take care of her

37:51.227 --> 37:52.478
the way this one did Talbot?

37:52.561 --> 37:54.105
She couldn't ID, Henry.

37:54.188 --> 37:55.398
What do we do with him? Let him go?

37:55.690 --> 37:57.400
Hold for arraignment tomorrow morning.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.527
-Got a charge?
-Resisting, conspiring.

37:59.902 --> 38:01.320
-What about the brother?
-DA won't charge.

38:01.404 --> 38:02.863
Guarantee you, he'll be out by tomorrow.

38:04.573 --> 38:06.450
Just who the hell do you think you are?

38:15.042 --> 38:16.460
Roll that back, Oz.

38:16.544 --> 38:18.129
It's Mayor Cleveland.

38:19.672 --> 38:22.091
-Mayor.
-You suggest we legalize heroin?

38:22.717 --> 38:25.511
-Oz-- Mayor--
-That we put a cop on every street corner?

38:26.095 --> 38:27.888
I'm not sure the Third Reich
had that kind of compliment.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.390
Not at all what I suggested.

38:29.890 --> 38:32.310
It was on the damned afternoon news.

38:32.393 --> 38:34.478
You were on the damn camera.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.523
No, what I was trying to say there
was that you have to put the problem

38:37.606 --> 38:38.649
-in a larger context.
-(sighs)

38:38.733 --> 38:40.067
I can't be responsible for their editing.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.361
"Trenchant political concerns.

38:42.445 --> 38:45.448
Politicians moving
onto other trendy issues."

38:45.531 --> 38:46.907
-That's out of context.
-Bull.

38:47.616 --> 38:49.160
You have hurt me, Frank.

38:49.243 --> 38:50.870
And you're going to pay for it.

38:52.079 --> 38:54.582
First, we'll see about
minimizing the damage.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.625
Have a statement ready
by 9:00 tomorrow morning.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.794
-What for?
-A press conference.

38:59.712 --> 39:01.464
We're going to see
how much of this you can eat.

39:11.974 --> 39:14.226
-Captain, do you have a minute?
-Sure, Luce.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.192
Do you want to talk privately?

39:21.776 --> 39:25.279
Uh, no... I guess I'm just feeling
out in left field.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.074
-What do you mean?
-Well...

39:29.742 --> 39:31.202
I'm not really on the street anymore.

39:31.285 --> 39:33.788
I'm not a street cop
and I don't feel like a sergeant yet.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.040
It's only been two weeks, Luce.

39:36.332 --> 39:39.251
Actually, I don't mean the job.
I mean, that part is really going okay.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.212
It's... It's like...

39:43.881 --> 39:46.675
I just got a car, a new car, a compact.

39:47.301 --> 39:49.303
You don't know how long
I've been promising myself

39:49.387 --> 39:51.806
that someday
I was going to buy new wheels.

39:52.306 --> 39:53.641
I felt great about it.

39:55.351 --> 39:56.227
So that's good.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.814
See, I didn't have anybody to tell.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.858
I mean, if I told Joe or Bobby
or even Andy,

40:02.942 --> 40:04.068
it's like I'm rubbing their noses in it.

40:04.151 --> 40:06.278
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah, I do.

40:07.196 --> 40:10.074
Besides, I miss the action.
I just miss being out on the street.

40:10.157 --> 40:11.909
It's not an easy transition, Luce.

40:12.451 --> 40:14.453
For everything you gain,
you have to give up something.

40:15.287 --> 40:18.499
Yeah. I'm glad I got the problem.

40:20.876 --> 40:22.002
You're not wearing your stripes.

40:23.504 --> 40:25.005
Just haven't had time to put them on.

40:28.592 --> 40:29.510
Put them on, Luce.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.725
(soft music playing)

40:46.277 --> 40:47.319
(sighs)

40:49.071 --> 40:50.030
Hi.

40:51.740 --> 40:52.658
Hi.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.299
This is kind of like a nightmare, Mick.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.134
Please, you got to say why.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.429
-I said.
-What?

41:14.555 --> 41:16.724
I don't want us to see each other anymore.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.726
That's not a reason, Mick.

41:19.268 --> 41:20.519
'Cause I think it's better.

41:20.769 --> 41:23.272
'Cause I don't happen to think
we're good for each other, okay?

41:25.399 --> 41:27.234
You don't get to say what you are for me.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.028
Come on, don't cry.

41:29.111 --> 41:31.614
Because I love you.

41:32.364 --> 41:33.491
And we're in love.

41:33.741 --> 41:36.368
And we're the best thing
that ever happened for each other.

41:37.870 --> 41:39.538
Everyone dies.

41:41.916 --> 41:45.836
Everybody that I touch dies.

41:47.213 --> 41:50.049
I couldn't stand it
if anything happened to you.

41:50.716 --> 41:51.884
It would kill me.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.969
Well, they don't die
'cause you love them, Mick.

41:54.053 --> 41:55.471
-They do.
-No.

41:55.971 --> 41:58.140
Some things die 'cause it's their time.

41:58.224 --> 42:00.726
Like your pop, or like the sarge.

42:01.352 --> 42:02.478
He was too young.

42:03.812 --> 42:05.523
Yeah, he was too young.

42:06.232 --> 42:07.358
But it was his time.

42:09.485 --> 42:10.444
And the others...

42:12.238 --> 42:13.781
everyone on the street who's hurt,

42:14.949 --> 42:17.660
if they've got guts
or they're-they're a little weird,

42:17.743 --> 42:18.827
you reach out to them.

42:18.911 --> 42:20.621
And the thing is, they're hurt.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.249
And some hurt things die.

42:23.749 --> 42:25.125
But it's not 'cause you touched them.

42:26.752 --> 42:28.921
You touching them,
that's a good thing in their lives.

42:29.004 --> 42:31.840
I'm so afraid
something will happen to you.

42:34.969 --> 42:36.345
I don't know what I'd do.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.139
I'm not going anyplace, Mick.

42:40.641 --> 42:42.268
You can't lose me for anything.

42:51.151 --> 42:54.488
(grunting)

42:54.572 --> 42:55.990
All right, relax.

42:56.073 --> 42:57.366
All right, the next thing
we're going to do,

42:57.449 --> 42:59.451
we're going to do a backhand strike
with the right hand.

42:59.827 --> 43:00.911
I'll show you how we did it.

43:01.120 --> 43:01.954
I'm going to take a step forward,

43:02.037 --> 43:03.998
we're going to strike
an imaginary object up here.

43:04.081 --> 43:05.916
All right, down, toes turned in.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.876
Snap the arm back, all right?

43:08.627 --> 43:09.503
(grunts)

43:10.004 --> 43:11.130
All right, want to try that?

43:11.880 --> 43:14.091
All right, toes in. Good fists.

43:14.174 --> 43:15.926
(grunting)

43:16.010 --> 43:17.511
Back. One more from the gut.

43:18.554 --> 43:19.847
(grunting)

43:20.139 --> 43:22.099
Back. Good. Real good.

43:22.433 --> 43:23.267
Ready position.

43:24.727 --> 43:27.187
You did real good.
I'll see you all next Tuesday.

43:28.188 --> 43:29.231
Bow.

43:29.648 --> 43:31.025
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

43:40.909 --> 43:41.827
Fay.

43:43.037 --> 43:45.164
-Damn it, Fay.
-Everything all right, Mrs. Furillo?

43:45.247 --> 43:47.374
Hey, go watch a Bruce Lee movie.

43:48.709 --> 43:49.710
Good idea.

43:52.504 --> 43:54.298
Very macho, Henry.

43:54.673 --> 43:57.301
Ten days of messages,
three notes in your mailbox.

43:57.384 --> 43:59.386
And I thought the return message
was very clear.

43:59.470 --> 44:00.554
I didn't get a return message.

44:01.096 --> 44:03.390
That's the message. We broke up.

44:03.849 --> 44:06.268
Hey, I was under the impression
that we parted friends.

44:06.352 --> 44:07.895
-I reconsidered.
-When?

44:08.437 --> 44:09.772
The next morning.

44:09.855 --> 44:13.150
You see, I don't put the same premium
on being reasonable as you do.

44:13.484 --> 44:14.902
You know, you were the one who suggested

44:14.985 --> 44:16.904
that maybe we should stop
seeing one another.

44:16.987 --> 44:21.200
And as I recall, your exact words were,
"Sounds right to me."

44:22.159 --> 44:26.580
-Can't we talk about it at least?
-No. No. I choose to go on with my life.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.666
I do not choose to rehash old business.

44:28.749 --> 44:31.418
Fay, this business
has not been hashed yet.

44:32.836 --> 44:34.088
Please.

44:36.090 --> 44:37.549
(clicks tongue) Okay.

44:45.140 --> 44:46.100
FAY: <i>You bet I'm angry.</i>

44:46.183 --> 44:48.435
I'm angry because you weren't
more attracted to me.

44:49.269 --> 44:51.230
I'm angry because you wouldn't
just admit it.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.315
And I'm angry
because you made me feel like

44:53.399 --> 44:55.275
there was something wrong with me
because of it.

44:56.026 --> 44:58.237
And I'm angry
because you wouldn't fight harder

44:58.320 --> 44:59.863
to try and find it.

45:01.865 --> 45:03.367
I was attracted to you, Fay.

45:04.868 --> 45:08.997
But I seem to recollect
you saying we bring adult baggage

45:09.373 --> 45:10.749
to the relationship.

45:12.793 --> 45:14.211
Don't kick me out of your life

45:14.294 --> 45:16.714
because the relationship
didn't give you everything you wanted.

45:19.675 --> 45:23.303
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I didn't fight hard enough.

45:24.847 --> 45:26.598
You, the baby, Frank Jr.,

45:26.682 --> 45:28.976
you've been the best things
in my life this past year.

45:31.311 --> 45:34.523
Maybe unconsciously I felt if we fight,
that's jeopardize,

45:34.606 --> 45:36.567
so I pulled back.

45:37.192 --> 45:38.569
(scoffs) I don't know.

45:39.862 --> 45:42.197
You've been the best thing
in our lives, too, Henry.

45:42.489 --> 45:44.908
-(sighs)
-(chuckles)

45:45.993 --> 45:48.328
You know, Frank Jr.
asks about Josh all the time.

45:48.412 --> 45:49.997
-(exhales)
-And you.

45:51.832 --> 45:53.459
I don't want to lose all of it, Fay.

45:55.961 --> 45:57.171
I don't want to, either.

45:58.922 --> 46:00.048
But, I mean, um...

46:02.050 --> 46:03.510
to hell with the reasons.

46:05.637 --> 46:07.097
If we can't be lovers,

46:08.432 --> 46:10.058
can't we at least be loving friends?

46:16.523 --> 46:19.318
-At least that.
-Yeah.

46:35.667 --> 46:37.377
(clicks tongue) I'm trying to think
of 20 different ways

46:37.461 --> 46:40.047
I could eat humble pie
at Ozzie's press conference.

46:51.433 --> 46:52.434
Let's talk about it.

46:55.270 --> 46:57.105
Is that the captain talking or my husband?

46:57.189 --> 46:58.023
That's not fair.

47:02.402 --> 47:03.987
'Cause I sure had the feeling

47:04.071 --> 47:06.824
that was the captain's arm on me
outside that lineup room.

47:10.577 --> 47:11.954
I have a line to walk, too.

47:13.789 --> 47:15.165
The captain needs to make this case.

47:15.249 --> 47:17.584
The captain can't do that
without your testimony.

47:18.043 --> 47:20.003
That doesn't mean I don't understand
what you're going through.

47:21.129 --> 47:22.464
Frank, I know what my duty is.

47:22.548 --> 47:25.008
How do you think it makes me feel
knowing that I can't do it?

47:25.092 --> 47:26.760
Joyce, I almost lost you today.

47:27.928 --> 47:29.429
I don't want that feeling again.

47:31.765 --> 47:34.726
To be perfectly honest, I don't want
a couple of sociopaths angry with you,

47:34.810 --> 47:36.186
but I know we can protect you.

47:37.563 --> 47:38.856
I want you to know that.

47:40.065 --> 47:42.818
I know that was a two-way mirror.
No way Mullins could see me.

47:46.446 --> 47:49.950
But it's--
it seems like his eyes never left me.

47:50.033 --> 47:51.702
