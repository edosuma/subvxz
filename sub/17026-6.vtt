01:15.999 --> 01:17.119
They're coming tonight?

01:17.119 --> 01:18.479
We talked about this
two weeks ago.

01:18.639 --> 01:19.479
It's not a good
weekend.

01:19.639 --> 01:21.159
So when's good?
Pick a day.

01:21.319 --> 01:22.439
I'm working a shift
Saturday.

01:22.599 --> 01:23.599
I won't even
be around.

01:23.719 --> 01:24.599
They're excited.

01:24.759 --> 01:25.439
They've been
planning this.

01:25.439 --> 01:26.439
They're about
to drive five hours

01:26.439 --> 01:27.719
to come see you,
see us.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.599
You want me to tell 'em
not to bother?

01:29.719 --> 01:30.679
I think you better.

01:30.839 --> 01:32.359
Been doing that
since you got back.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.519
They're starting
to wonder.

01:33.639 --> 01:34.519
Wonder what?

01:34.639 --> 01:35.639
What's wrong.

01:35.799 --> 01:38.239
I got a full day,
all right?

01:38.359 --> 01:40.839
The house is a mess.
They need clean linens.

01:41.039 --> 01:44.399
Look, look, I've
already set up
the guestroom.

01:44.519 --> 01:45.639
We'll stay in tonight,

01:45.639 --> 01:47.599
have dinner.
I don't have time
to cook dinner.

01:47.679 --> 01:48.919
Then we'll go out.

01:48.919 --> 01:51.359
After that drive, they're
not gonna want to go out.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.759
It's just three days.

01:52.879 --> 01:53.839
(SCOFFS)

01:54.039 --> 01:58.239
They're your family.
And they miss you.

02:02.639 --> 02:05.078
It's not my fault the pipes
froze up and burst.

02:05.198 --> 02:06.838
What?

02:06.998 --> 02:11.878
OK, well, then you can
at least pay for the hotel.

02:11.998 --> 02:14.558
No. No.

02:14.678 --> 02:15.598
No, no, no.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.998
I don't care
what the law says.

02:20.158 --> 02:21.358
OK, you know what?
forget it.

02:21.438 --> 02:23.518
Thank you, you jerk.

02:23.638 --> 02:25.238
I don't understand
how he can do that.

02:25.398 --> 02:27.078
We have two days
to find a place

02:27.238 --> 02:28.878
while they fix
the stupid pipes.
I don't...

02:29.078 --> 02:31.398
You know, there is an
obvious solution.

02:34.838 --> 02:38.438
Hey, hey!
You can't be right there.

02:38.598 --> 02:40.278
I gotta pick up
a physiology syllabus.

02:40.438 --> 02:41.558
I'll see you inside,
OK?

02:41.718 --> 02:43.918
All right. Hold it.
Hey, come on, buddy.

02:43.918 --> 02:45.518
We got sick people
in here. Let's go.

02:45.518 --> 02:48.838
Let's go.
Come on.

02:48.998 --> 02:52.198
Order me around!
Don't order me around!

02:55.158 --> 02:56.318
(GROANING)

02:56.478 --> 02:57.918
And today's the fourth time
in three weeks

02:57.998 --> 02:59.038
that you crashed your bike?

02:59.198 --> 03:01.198
Where does it hurt at,
exactly?

03:01.358 --> 03:03.318
Right side.
Shoots down my leg.

03:03.438 --> 03:05.278
Any weakness in the foot?

03:05.398 --> 03:07.318
Are you for real?
I can hardly walk!

03:07.478 --> 03:08.758
Chaz, my man,
how we doing?

03:08.878 --> 03:10.958
Good. I put a splint
on your ankle guy,

03:11.158 --> 03:12.398
and restocked
the paramedic cart.

03:12.478 --> 03:13.798
Already? Wow.

03:13.798 --> 03:14.998
I need something
for the pain, damn it!

03:14.998 --> 03:15.838
You've already had
ten of morphine.

03:15.838 --> 03:17.358
It ain't touched me.
You know what, Patty?

03:17.358 --> 03:18.998
Maybe you should start
thinking about taking the bus.

03:18.998 --> 03:20.878
I mean, not that we don't
thoroughly enjoy

03:21.078 --> 03:22.158
seeing you
every week.

03:22.358 --> 03:23.998
Dr Morris, I'm concerned
about an L4 motor deficit.

03:24.158 --> 03:26.718
Huh? She's never
had that before.

03:26.718 --> 03:27.838
Could be nerve-root
impingement.

03:27.918 --> 03:29.118
Cord compression.

03:29.118 --> 03:30.678
We should check for

03:30.798 --> 03:34.038
cauda equina syndrome.

03:34.038 --> 03:35.518
We're checking labs
and doing blood draws?

03:35.638 --> 03:37.758
He's a first-year med student.
He should be observing.

03:37.758 --> 03:39.678
Teacher's pet needs
to learn how to do a physical.

03:39.798 --> 03:41.477
I heard he's an EMT,
he still works shifts.

03:41.597 --> 03:42.637
I can't stand those
do-it-all guys.

03:42.757 --> 03:43.677
Especially ones named Chaz.

03:43.797 --> 03:45.077
What kind of name is that?

03:45.197 --> 03:47.397
Gates: Chaz Pratt, nice coat.

03:47.517 --> 03:48.357
What's up, Tony?

03:48.477 --> 03:49.797
Hey, Frank, page neurosurge.

03:49.957 --> 03:51.717
I need a stat lumbar
MRI on Patty.

03:51.837 --> 03:54.277
You mean Patty
the pain in the ass?

03:54.277 --> 03:56.077
Yeah. You know, we all
assume she's full of it,

03:56.277 --> 03:57.517
but Chaz picked up
a foot drop.

03:57.637 --> 03:59.437
She may need emergent
decompression surgery.

03:59.557 --> 04:00.677
Nice job, buddy.

04:00.837 --> 04:02.317
Healin' and dealin',
I dig it.

04:02.437 --> 04:05.237
Hey, you guys should
take her up to radiology.

04:05.397 --> 04:06.997
Maybe the med student
could do that.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.757
Good idea.
You know what?

04:08.957 --> 04:10.637
We'll all go.
I'll meet you guys up there.

04:10.797 --> 04:12.637
Cool.

04:12.797 --> 04:14.397
Dude, Chaz,
he's a natural.

04:14.517 --> 04:15.677
Must be in the genes.

04:15.757 --> 04:16.637
Oh, yeah?

04:16.757 --> 04:17.837
Yeah. He's awesome.

04:17.916 --> 04:18.757
Smarter than I ever was.

04:18.957 --> 04:19.716
That ain't
sayin' much.

04:19.837 --> 04:20.997
Stable pneumonia,

04:21.156 --> 04:23.757
had ceftriaxone and zithro,
Medicine's admitting.

04:23.757 --> 04:26.077
Frank, why has my cellulitis guy
been here all night?

04:26.157 --> 04:27.077
Oh, get in line, Gates.

04:27.237 --> 04:29.437
I just got here.
I haven't had my coffee.

04:29.597 --> 04:31.357
CHF'er with intractable nausea,
ultrasound's negative,

04:31.477 --> 04:33.717
so I'm thinking gastro.

04:33.877 --> 04:35.997
Digitoxicity could
explain the symptoms.

04:36.157 --> 04:37.837
She's right.
Good thinking.

04:37.957 --> 04:39.237
All right,
I'll add a level.

04:39.437 --> 04:41.357
Why you all dressed up?
You gotta hot date
or something?

04:41.477 --> 04:42.837
You're blushing.

04:42.837 --> 04:45.997
No, Dr Banfield just suggested
that I present myself more,

04:46.117 --> 04:47.637
you know, professionally, so...

04:47.637 --> 04:51.117
These are not gonna cure
themselves.

04:52.557 --> 04:53.637
What do I gotta do

04:53.757 --> 04:55.357
to get some damn morphine
from you people?!

04:55.357 --> 04:56.357
What is wrong
with you people?

04:56.517 --> 04:57.797
OK, let's do this.
Thank God!

04:57.957 --> 05:00.717
So, Chaz, you'll see
a herniated disc at l4-l5,

05:00.877 --> 05:03.957
L5-S1 according to our
exam on Ms Mcphee.

05:03.957 --> 05:05.317
Dr Morris, can we go
in the booth?

05:05.477 --> 05:06.837
No, you cannot go
in the booth.

05:06.997 --> 05:09.197
Now, get her in here.
I haven't got all day.

05:09.357 --> 05:10.957
Chaz: Let me give you guys a hand.

05:11.077 --> 05:12.517
"Can we go in the booth?"

05:12.637 --> 05:14.157
(PATTY SCREAMS)

05:16.477 --> 05:17.677
You didn't switch out
the gurneys?!

05:17.677 --> 05:18.636
I thought he did it.

05:18.756 --> 05:19.796
I thought you did it.

05:19.956 --> 05:22.876
I didn't know
it had to be done.

05:22.996 --> 05:25.836
Can I get my morphine now?

05:36.036 --> 05:39.596
How much? Does that come
with breakfast or anything?

05:39.716 --> 05:42.116
OK, thank you.

05:42.276 --> 05:43.996
Frank, do you know
any good, cheap hotels?

05:44.116 --> 05:45.996
Good and cheap? No.
One or the other.

05:46.116 --> 05:47.396
Hey, Sam, you think
about my solution?

05:47.516 --> 05:48.396
Solution?

05:48.516 --> 05:49.436
Yeah, to your problem.

05:49.596 --> 05:51.076
Well, if you got one,
spit it out.

05:51.236 --> 05:54.876
All right, I was
thinking that maybe you...

05:54.876 --> 05:55.956
Sorry.
Excuse me, Sam.

05:56.116 --> 05:58.436
Mr Rappaport in three needs
a repeat trope drawn.

05:58.436 --> 05:59.836
It should've been
sent an hour ago.

05:59.956 --> 06:02.636
Sorry. I don't know why
night shift didn't tell me.

06:02.756 --> 06:03.756
I'll get it.

06:03.916 --> 06:05.116
And if he's got
two negative troponins?

06:05.276 --> 06:06.596
Low-risk patient. If cards can do
a treadmill today, he'll go home.

06:06.596 --> 06:07.676
All right, good plan.

06:07.796 --> 06:08.796
Hey, Crash,
how's it goin'?

06:08.796 --> 06:09.876
Radiology called,

06:10.036 --> 06:13.356
said you owe 'em 300
large for a new scanner.

06:13.516 --> 06:14.596
You heard about
that already?

06:14.756 --> 06:16.516
Yeah, I heard
you almost killed a woman.

06:16.676 --> 06:18.676
Her plain films
were negative.
She's fine.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.636
Oh, Chaz, I don't know
if anyone's told you,

06:20.796 --> 06:22.196
but the M in MRI

06:22.316 --> 06:23.716
stands for "magnetic."

06:23.836 --> 06:25.236
Thanks for the tip.

06:25.436 --> 06:27.076
Dr Morris, Miss Mcphee's
still pretty upset

06:27.196 --> 06:30.236
about the whole gurney thing,
but her foot drop resolved.

06:30.396 --> 06:31.636
She's got full range
of motion.

06:31.756 --> 06:32.836
Ha!

06:32.996 --> 06:35.276
Well, the accident
must've been some weird

06:35.476 --> 06:37.596
chiropractic manipulation.
Nice job.

06:37.596 --> 06:38.836
You cured a patient.

06:38.836 --> 06:41.516
(CHUCKLES)

06:41.676 --> 06:43.996
I should go check the supply
carts in the exam rooms.

06:44.156 --> 06:45.836
And through there
are the trauma rooms

06:46.036 --> 06:47.076
where all
the really serious cases go.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.396
Hey, Brenner,
I got your

06:48.396 --> 06:49.996
unstable angina admitted
to cards.

06:49.996 --> 06:53.276
Thanks. Morris, Frank, these
my mates, Colin and Roger.

06:53.276 --> 06:55.195
These your derelict countrymen
I've heard about?

06:55.195 --> 06:56.195
Pleasure.
G' day.

06:56.315 --> 06:57.795
(AUSTRALIAN ACCENT)
Ah, g'day to you, too.

06:57.955 --> 06:59.595
Dr Morris, we gotta rig
coming in.

06:59.715 --> 07:02.075
Oh, hello, there.

07:02.075 --> 07:03.475
Hi.
Dawn Archer.
Hi there.

07:03.675 --> 07:05.555
Charmed.
OK, that's
about it, guys.

07:05.555 --> 07:06.715
There you have it.
County General.

07:06.875 --> 07:07.875
Beauty, man.
It's impressive.

07:07.875 --> 07:09.035
Yeah, good on ya.

07:09.235 --> 07:10.835
Still can't believe you guys
still trust the bastard

07:10.915 --> 07:11.835
with actual human lives.

07:11.995 --> 07:12.795
Us either.

07:12.955 --> 07:13.515
Brenner: Much appreciated,
Frank.

07:13.635 --> 07:14.795
Where you guys headed?

07:14.955 --> 07:16.515
Big game.
Sevens against
the dreaded Kiwis.

07:16.715 --> 07:18.955
It's rugby.
It's seven on seven

07:19.075 --> 07:20.115
against some boys
from New Zealand.

07:20.275 --> 07:22.035
Oh, I've always wanted
to learn rugby.

07:22.195 --> 07:23.435
Maybe I can come out
with you sometime.

07:23.515 --> 07:25.595
Yeah, maybe.

07:25.795 --> 07:27.435
I was a kicker for my high
school football team,

07:27.595 --> 07:28.755
Yeah, if you ever
need an extra.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.755
Right now, we're good.
I'm all signed out.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.155
But I'll see you guys later.

07:32.315 --> 07:33.075
Are you gonna play
in your stubbies?

07:33.155 --> 07:34.435
Yeah, I'm true blue, man.

07:34.435 --> 07:37.915
Somebody print out a recipe
for chicken piccata?

07:38.035 --> 07:40.875
Do you read everything that
comes off the printer, Frank?

07:41.075 --> 07:42.315
Yes. And if you need
recipes,

07:42.515 --> 07:44.955
I got some that can knock
your socks off.

07:45.075 --> 07:46.435
Keep your recipes to yourself.

07:46.555 --> 07:48.635
Looks like maybe it's
just gastroenteritis.

07:48.755 --> 07:49.995
Do think they'd call us

07:50.155 --> 07:51.995
down here for a
non-surgical problem?

07:52.155 --> 07:53.795
Is this about my two-year-old
with vomiting?

07:53.795 --> 07:54.955
What's your differential?

07:55.155 --> 07:57.955
Uh, right. OK,
so something structural...

07:57.955 --> 07:59.155
Mm-hmm.
..like maybe...

07:59.275 --> 08:00.995
I'm thinking malrotation

08:00.995 --> 08:02.075
with a possible
volvulus.

08:02.075 --> 08:04.115
How do you think
we should proceed?

08:04.275 --> 08:05.555
I'll order
an upper GI.

08:05.555 --> 08:07.195
Oh, you mind if I do
the cut down?

08:07.395 --> 08:09.395
No, not today. Too busy.
Go back to the floor.

08:09.555 --> 08:11.875
I'll just put in a line
and meet you back at rounds.

08:14.435 --> 08:16.155
Derrek Taylor, 21,
facial and chest trauma...
Move, please!

08:16.315 --> 08:18.315
..from a knockout
in the fifth round.

08:18.435 --> 08:19.275
How you doing, Derrek?

08:19.435 --> 08:20.595
Move!
Been better.

08:20.755 --> 08:22.475
They didn't say nothing
about him being a southpaw.

08:22.595 --> 08:23.635
Coming through!
Dawn, what's open?

08:23.635 --> 08:24.595
Trauma two's ready.

08:24.595 --> 08:26.115
I hate southpaws.

08:26.115 --> 08:27.515
Dr Morris I'd like
to discuss the case

08:27.675 --> 08:29.034
of the levitating gurney
at some point.

08:29.154 --> 08:30.354
Be there as soon
as I can!

08:30.474 --> 08:31.474
Looks like a broken nose.

08:31.474 --> 08:32.634
Third time.

08:32.794 --> 08:35.234
But I feel pretty good now.
I don't need all this.

08:35.234 --> 08:36.313
Yo, Chaz, facial trauma
with LOC.

08:36.313 --> 08:37.874
We can review
the cranial nerve exam.

08:37.953 --> 08:39.274
Well, lookie what we got here.

08:39.274 --> 08:40.234
Bards, what's up, baby?

08:40.394 --> 08:42.274
Not much, ice cream man.
Looks good on you.

08:42.274 --> 08:43.234
You know how to assess

08:43.354 --> 08:44.874
for mandible fractures
with a tongue blade?

08:44.874 --> 08:46.034
No.
Good.
I'll show you.

08:46.034 --> 08:46.914
You sending him
to CT?

08:47.034 --> 08:48.154
Definitely.

08:48.154 --> 08:48.914
Dr Banfield said
we should jump in on this.

08:49.074 --> 08:50.874
Yeah, sure.
Kaya, on your count.

08:50.874 --> 08:52.354
OK, one, two, three.

08:53.874 --> 08:55.634
Pleasure doing
business with you.

08:55.754 --> 08:58.274
Chaz, don't screw it up.

08:58.394 --> 09:01.354
Trauma panel, portable chest,
head and facial CT.

09:01.514 --> 09:02.714
Kaya, eyes and nose.
Ryan, extremities.

09:02.874 --> 09:04.874
Chaz, we'll do the
primary assessment.

09:04.994 --> 09:06.434
Pulse ox 99 on 2 litres.

09:06.434 --> 09:08.034
Sixth round,
I was gonna make my move.

09:08.114 --> 09:09.234
You were a round too late.

09:09.394 --> 09:10.994
Breath sounds good
bilaterally.

09:11.114 --> 09:12.154
A little tachycardic.

09:12.234 --> 09:13.474
I agree completely.

09:13.634 --> 09:15.354
I thought I had him. Damn.

09:15.354 --> 09:16.874
You cannot explain
that sport to me.
Look at this poor man.

09:16.874 --> 09:18.434
Lid edema,
no hyphema.

09:18.554 --> 09:20.394
Peripheral pulses intact.

09:20.554 --> 09:21.754
They call it the sweet science
for a reason.

09:21.914 --> 09:23.074
It's a lot harder
than it looks.

09:23.194 --> 09:24.634
I'm not saying it
ain't hard, just stupid.

09:24.634 --> 09:26.114
So what are you,
a middleweight?

09:26.274 --> 09:27.234
Welterweight.

09:27.354 --> 09:28.314
You a fighter?

09:28.434 --> 09:30.594
No, my dad just showed me
a little bit.

09:30.594 --> 09:32.954
Mine, too.

09:32.954 --> 09:34.914
Old man won the golden gloves
back in the day.

09:36.914 --> 09:38.594
OK, tell 'em if they can't
take him next,

09:38.754 --> 09:40.274
I'll talk to an attending.
Maybe Betina's on.

09:40.434 --> 09:41.874
We had dinner together
the other night.

09:42.074 --> 09:43.634
Oh, yeah?
How's she doing?
Really good.

09:43.634 --> 09:44.754
She's just putting
in a lot of work

09:44.914 --> 09:45.874
on that after-school programme
we starting in Greg's name.

09:45.874 --> 09:47.634
You pretty young for a doctor.

09:47.634 --> 09:49.114
I'm a med student.

09:49.114 --> 09:50.114
Brainiac, huh?

09:50.194 --> 09:51.434
Not really.

09:51.434 --> 09:53.314
I just decided this
is what I want to do.

09:53.314 --> 09:55.274
Looks like it's working out
for you.

09:55.274 --> 09:56.514
Trying.
It's not easy, though.

09:56.634 --> 09:57.434
I feel you.

09:57.554 --> 09:58.674
He's got a septal hematoma.

09:58.674 --> 09:59.674
I need an 11 blade.

09:59.834 --> 10:02.074
It's OK.
I'll do the procedure with Chaz.

10:08.313 --> 10:10.033
Hey.
Hey.

10:10.113 --> 10:11.993
Labs come back on taxi lady?

10:12.073 --> 10:14.673
What? Oh, yeah.

10:14.833 --> 10:17.153
Isolated thrombocytopenia.
Yeah, just like you thought.

10:17.273 --> 10:18.233
Did haematology see her?

10:18.353 --> 10:19.593
Uh, yeah, they want
to start an IVIG.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.873
Blood bank's gonna
send it down.

10:20.873 --> 10:22.433
Perfect.
OK.

10:22.593 --> 10:23.273
Coffee?

10:23.273 --> 10:26.073
No, no, I get this per cent
latte thing.

10:26.073 --> 10:27.313
Thanks, though.

10:37.273 --> 10:41.753
Hey, you want
a hot coffee?

10:41.753 --> 10:43.633
It's cold out here.

10:43.753 --> 10:46.673
I have an extra. Here.

10:53.953 --> 10:56.593
You want to come inside,
have us check you out?

10:56.593 --> 10:58.353
Have a shower,
hot meal.

10:58.473 --> 10:59.793
Hate hospitals.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.793
All right, offer stands.

11:07.753 --> 11:10.153
L-shaped incision
from high to low,

11:10.353 --> 11:12.273
then along the
floor of the nose.

11:12.393 --> 11:13.433
OK.

11:13.593 --> 11:15.433
OK, if we don't drain it,
we get something

11:15.433 --> 11:17.793
called pressure necrosis
of the septum.

11:17.873 --> 11:19.713
Go for it.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.233
Everything OK in here?

11:21.433 --> 11:23.433
Morris:
Yeah, draining a
septal hematoma.

11:26.673 --> 11:27.873
Pressure down
to 80 systolic.

11:27.873 --> 11:29.953
Squeeze in a
litre of saline.

11:29.953 --> 11:30.713
Pulse ox down 85.

11:30.873 --> 11:32.673
Set the packing
underneath the flap.

11:34.753 --> 11:36.073
How you doing, sir?

11:36.193 --> 11:37.953
Sir?

11:37.953 --> 11:39.312
100% non rebreather.

11:39.472 --> 11:40.992
Intubation tray
and repeat the haemocue.

11:41.152 --> 11:43.552
Uh, prep a cordis
for the IJ.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.992
Banfield:
Please tell me why
we're ignoring the ABCs

11:47.992 --> 11:49.672
of a critical
trauma patient.
No, we were

11:49.672 --> 11:51.472
doing an emergent procedure
and the patient was stable.

11:51.472 --> 11:53.152
Did you call surgery?
They're on their way.

11:53.152 --> 11:54.232
And who's your assistant

11:54.232 --> 11:56.112
with the
short coat?

11:56.112 --> 11:57.832
Med student.

11:57.832 --> 11:59.712
Fourth year?
First.

11:59.712 --> 12:01.712
And you got him with a scalpel
up a patient's nose.

12:01.872 --> 12:03.952
Anything wrong with
that picture, Dr Morris?

13:34.791 --> 13:35.751
CROAKING

13:46.631 --> 13:47.631
CAR HORN

13:51.951 --> 13:54.191
BARKING

13:56.911 --> 13:58.151
HOWL

14:02.551 --> 14:04.551
A more connected world

14:04.671 --> 14:06.351
is a better world.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.191
We're better, connected.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.511
# GENTLE PIANO

14:21.071 --> 14:24.031
If you think you can't
enjoy real dairy,

14:24.111 --> 14:25.351
think again.

14:25.871 --> 14:27.671
Find out
more at...

14:31.191 --> 14:33.271
Your mission statement
is "Keep it weird".

14:33.351 --> 14:35.151
Is that really a business strategy?

14:35.231 --> 14:36.471
"Keep it weird" is our wink for

14:36.591 --> 14:38.991
"Keep it human,
keep it real, keep it different".

14:39.111 --> 14:41.191
Like, we don't...
we don't build rockets over here.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.071
We do... we make soap. (laughs)

14:43.191 --> 14:44.911
And it's pretty hard
to make soap different

14:44.991 --> 14:46.191
than other soap that's out there.

14:46.311 --> 14:48.791
So, typically,
the more different an idea is,

14:48.911 --> 14:50.510
the more fragile an idea is,
the more likely

14:50.630 --> 14:52.710
it gets beat down to death
and never goes anywhere.

14:52.830 --> 14:56.350
And if we lose our confidence to...
to be weird and to be different,

14:56.470 --> 14:58.230
we lose that ability
and then after a while,

14:58.350 --> 15:00.150
you start to look like
everybody else.

15:00.270 --> 15:03.150
Uh-huh. So how do you make sure
you've got everybody in the company

15:03.270 --> 15:05.190
working together
to keep it different?

15:05.270 --> 15:06.390
You have to have an environment

15:06.510 --> 15:08.350
that people are comfortable
with sharing ideas

15:08.470 --> 15:09.750
and they're not
working against them.

15:09.870 --> 15:12.270
And anything we're working on
has to be out in the open.

15:12.390 --> 15:15.150
That way anybody can see it
and build upon it.

15:15.270 --> 15:18.350
So, we do everything to try to keep
people as connected as possible.

15:18.470 --> 15:21.190
And putting about
as much work into the culture

15:21.310 --> 15:23.830
as you would into the products
that you're creating.

15:31.110 --> 15:33.070
INDIAN MUSIC

15:34.150 --> 15:35.790
(all gasp)

15:35.910 --> 15:37.350
INDIAN MUSIC

15:44.550 --> 15:47.350
Everyone loves a good curry.

15:47.510 --> 15:49.790
And our new Uncle Ben's
Indian sauces

15:49.950 --> 15:52.070
have been made specially
so the whole family will love them.

15:52.190 --> 15:53.630
DOORBELL

15:53.790 --> 15:56.470
Each one is so delicious,
there'll be a rush to the table.

15:56.590 --> 15:58.470
Invite the world to dinner

15:58.590 --> 15:59.710
with new Uncle Ben's sauces.

17:24.589 --> 17:27.108
No perisplenic blood.

17:27.229 --> 17:28.629
And the subxiphoid view?

17:28.789 --> 17:29.949
Negative for
pericardial effusion.

17:30.069 --> 17:31.069
I'm not getting a flash.

17:31.189 --> 17:32.749
I'll give it a try.
No.

17:32.749 --> 17:35.509
Andrew,
45-degree angle.

17:35.509 --> 17:38.789
Aim for the
ipsilateral nipple.

17:39.869 --> 17:41.029
Level one is ready
with two litres.

17:41.149 --> 17:42.229
Soon as they get
the line.

17:43.829 --> 17:46.029
Rasgotra:
A little higher.

17:46.149 --> 17:46.989
No.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.469
I can't get it.
OK, move.

17:50.589 --> 17:52.869
No blood in the belly.

17:52.869 --> 17:53.669
Rasgotra:
Got a flash.

17:53.789 --> 17:54.629
Morris:
Chest is still clear,

17:54.789 --> 17:56.229
pupils are
still equal.

17:56.389 --> 17:57.709
Dawn:
Repeat haemocue is 14.2.

17:57.909 --> 17:59.109
Morris:
Oh, I guess
we didn't miss

17:59.269 --> 18:00.388
any internal bleeding.
He's just dehydrated.

18:00.468 --> 18:01.508
You got lucky.

18:01.628 --> 18:04.668
All right, you, you,
you and you, with me.

18:06.508 --> 18:08.268
Was I not clear?

18:08.468 --> 18:09.468
Now, please.
Rasgotra:
Excuse me,

18:09.548 --> 18:10.908
Dr Wade's a surgical intern.

18:11.028 --> 18:12.228
In my department.

18:12.228 --> 18:14.388
And I want to see the two of you
at the desk as well,

18:14.548 --> 18:16.388
soon as you're
finished here.

18:20.908 --> 18:22.028
Now is the time when you acquire

18:22.228 --> 18:23.588
the skills you need
for the future.

18:23.748 --> 18:27.308
Do not let upper-level residents
and attendings decide your fate.

18:27.428 --> 18:28.348
You get in there.

18:28.468 --> 18:29.388
This is your shot.

18:29.548 --> 18:31.308
Speak up for your right
to be educated.

18:31.428 --> 18:33.108
And if your supervisors
aren't respecting that right,

18:33.228 --> 18:34.868
then you talk to me.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.468
Except for you.

18:36.588 --> 18:37.748
You,

18:37.908 --> 18:39.628
stay quiet,
stand back and watch.

18:39.788 --> 18:42.508
You are barely
qualified to speak.

18:42.508 --> 18:43.508
OK, then.

18:43.628 --> 18:44.628
Let's get back to work.

18:50.788 --> 18:52.548
Look, I know what
you're going to say.

18:52.748 --> 18:55.268
We are teachers
at a teaching hospital.

18:55.428 --> 18:57.828
Which means we have a bunch of
young kids running around here

18:57.948 --> 18:59.788
trying to learn
how not to kill patients!

18:59.908 --> 19:00.748
I understand that, but...

19:00.908 --> 19:01.948
Banfield:
Then why are you teaching

19:02.108 --> 19:03.508
a first-year med student
a procedure

19:03.668 --> 19:04.788
that your interns
should be doing?

19:05.028 --> 19:06.708
Chaz was an EMT.
Banfield:
That's irrelevant.

19:06.828 --> 19:08.228
He is only here to observe.

19:08.388 --> 19:10.508
Teach your interns,
Dr Morris.

19:10.628 --> 19:11.708
Both of you.

19:11.868 --> 19:13.388
They learn by doing,
let them do things.

19:13.468 --> 19:15.428
Teach, educate, delegate.

19:15.548 --> 19:16.548
That's your job.

19:16.668 --> 19:17.628
Now go clear the board.

19:19.708 --> 19:22.668
Um, excuse me, Dr Banfield,
but with all due respect,

19:22.668 --> 19:24.148
we have a different culture
in surgery.

19:24.268 --> 19:25.228
And?

19:25.388 --> 19:26.628
And I'm going
to supervise my intern

19:26.748 --> 19:27.988
as I feel appropriate.

19:28.108 --> 19:30.028
And I don't appreciate
you undermining my authority.

19:30.028 --> 19:33.987
Dr Rasgotra, I prefer to handle
this at the attending level.

19:34.147 --> 19:36.907
You have a problem,
have Dr Dubenko give me a call.

19:42.747 --> 19:43.627
All right,
keep him warm.

19:43.787 --> 19:45.987
Keep the head of the
bed up 30 degrees.

19:46.147 --> 19:49.107
Hey, Sam, I want to
ask you something.

19:49.307 --> 19:51.267
Uh, so I wasn't
so clear earlier.

19:51.387 --> 19:53.267
About what?

19:53.267 --> 19:54.787
What?

19:54.907 --> 19:55.827
Move in with me.

19:55.907 --> 19:56.907
You and Alex

19:57.027 --> 20:00.627
need a place to stay,
you stay with me.

20:00.627 --> 20:01.587
No.

20:01.707 --> 20:02.667
We're not a charity case.

20:02.827 --> 20:03.747
Who said anything
about charity?

20:03.907 --> 20:05.307
We'll split
the rent.

20:05.307 --> 20:06.307
You mean, like, temporarily?

20:06.467 --> 20:08.507
Yeah, if that's
what you want.

20:08.507 --> 20:09.307
(SIGHS)

20:09.467 --> 20:10.987
Your place is too small.
We have

20:10.987 --> 20:12.267
an extra bedroom downstairs
we don't even use.

20:12.387 --> 20:13.627
What am I supposed to tell Alex?

20:13.787 --> 20:14.707
Alex and Sarah get
along.

20:14.867 --> 20:16.547
Me and Alex
are cool.

20:16.547 --> 20:17.627
(LAUGHS)

20:17.707 --> 20:18.747
You're insane!

20:18.747 --> 20:19.787
It's way too soon.

20:19.867 --> 20:20.707
It would never work.

20:20.867 --> 20:21.787
Why are you
laughing at me?

20:21.947 --> 20:23.187
I-I thought you wanted
to get serious.

20:23.187 --> 20:24.067
I, no, I do.

20:24.187 --> 20:25.667
I'm not laughing at you...

20:25.667 --> 20:26.827
Well, it sure seems
like you're laughing.

20:26.987 --> 20:27.907
You know, you're
something else.

20:28.067 --> 20:29.667
Why do you have to do
everything the hard way?

20:29.827 --> 20:30.747
You know what?
Forget it.

20:30.747 --> 20:31.667
Forget
I even asked.

20:31.667 --> 20:32.747
Just forget it.

20:32.747 --> 20:34.147
Tony...
Need a little help
over here!

20:39.467 --> 20:40.467
Excuse me?

20:40.627 --> 20:43.387
There's something
wrong with him.

20:43.547 --> 20:45.347
Hey, sir?

20:45.467 --> 20:47.827
Sir!

20:47.827 --> 20:49.467
How long you gonna
keep this up, huh? How long?

20:49.587 --> 20:50.627
800 bucks, Pop.

20:50.747 --> 20:51.987
Double if I win.

20:52.107 --> 20:52.947
We need that.

20:53.067 --> 20:54.507
Not this bad.

20:54.667 --> 20:55.947
Dawn, he needs
three grams of unasyn.

20:56.107 --> 20:56.907
I'm on it.

20:57.067 --> 20:58.147
Are you Derrek's dad?

20:58.147 --> 20:59.627
Yeah. Louie Taylor.
Dr Morris.

20:59.747 --> 21:02.107
Uh, the CT was negative.

21:02.107 --> 21:03.747
No bleeding in the brain.
It's good news.

21:03.747 --> 21:04.987
That means
you're gonna be OK.

21:05.107 --> 21:06.147
He's gonna be OK, right?

21:06.307 --> 21:09.386
Derrek, you have a
depressed zygoma fracture.

21:09.546 --> 21:11.266
Basically means your
cheek bone is broken.

21:11.426 --> 21:12.386
Louie:
But that's serious.

21:12.546 --> 21:13.546
Morris:
No, it's completely fixable.

21:13.626 --> 21:14.906
But it does require surgery.

21:14.906 --> 21:16.386
How long's it take
to come back from that?

21:16.386 --> 21:17.666
Good six weeks of recovery.

21:17.826 --> 21:20.826
You should be able to train
with headgear after that.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.146
Got another bout in two months.

21:22.306 --> 21:23.786
Damn it, Derrek...
Don't start, Pop!

21:23.946 --> 21:26.466
I ain't loading boxes
for nine dollars an hour.

21:26.626 --> 21:28.866
No, you'd rather continue
getting your ass beat, right?

21:29.066 --> 21:30.506
Morris:
Let's-let's take it
one thing at a time.

21:30.666 --> 21:32.346
OK? We'll get you through
the operation first.

21:32.346 --> 21:33.386
OK?

21:33.546 --> 21:35.466
Surgery should be down soon
to take you up.

21:35.466 --> 21:37.306
Hey, Dr Morris.

21:44.506 --> 21:46.266
You think he's really
gonna be able to fight again?

21:46.346 --> 21:48.106
Yeah, there's a good chance.

21:48.106 --> 21:49.546
Procedure's very routine,

21:49.666 --> 21:52.786
and he's young.

21:52.946 --> 21:54.026
You OK?

21:54.146 --> 21:55.786
Spinal stenosis.

21:55.986 --> 21:58.506
Up until a couple months ago,
I was able to work full-time,

21:58.506 --> 22:00.426
you know, hit the gym
a few days a week.

22:00.586 --> 22:02.746
Oh. We got some
great surgeons here.

22:02.866 --> 22:03.946
Yeah, I'm-I'm on the list.

22:04.066 --> 22:06.066
18-month wait.

22:06.066 --> 22:08.386
Derrek's got in his head
he's gonna

22:08.546 --> 22:10.786
make enough fighting,
get me the surgery.

22:10.946 --> 22:13.626
That and a new
car, new house.

22:13.626 --> 22:14.666
Seems like a great kid.

22:14.746 --> 22:15.986
Yeah.

22:16.146 --> 22:18.226
He showed a lot of promise
when he was young, you know?

22:18.386 --> 22:21.266
Then his
mother died.

22:23.226 --> 22:24.346
He's got a lot of heart, Doc,

22:24.506 --> 22:26.466
but his-his record's
5 and 28.

22:26.586 --> 22:28.666
Well, nothing's easy at first,

22:28.826 --> 22:30.026
but he keeps at
it, who knows?

22:30.146 --> 22:33.026
Yeah, but-but, Doc...

22:33.026 --> 22:35.066
You know what they say
about a fighter like that?

22:35.186 --> 22:38.026
He's a stiff, a bum,

22:38.146 --> 22:39.826
a silent offering.

22:39.946 --> 22:42.305
My son gets paid to lose.

22:42.385 --> 22:43.985
They laugh at him.

22:44.105 --> 22:46.025
They throw him in the ring
with somebody for real

22:46.185 --> 22:47.825
who can use him
to tune up on.

22:47.945 --> 22:48.945
You know what I'm saying?

22:49.065 --> 22:50.585
And for what?

22:52.545 --> 22:54.385
Man, I was good.

22:54.545 --> 22:57.425
And still, I was barely
good enough to turn pro.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.745
And Derrek ain't half
the fighter I used to be.

23:01.745 --> 23:04.945
Difference between us is that
I knew when to hang it up.

23:05.065 --> 23:06.425
Now he won't listen to me.

23:06.425 --> 23:09.545
But maybe
he'll listen to you.

23:09.705 --> 23:11.185
Maybe you could
talk to him.

23:11.185 --> 23:12.105
Help me out.

23:12.225 --> 23:15.545
Give him a real reason
to stop, huh?

23:17.585 --> 23:20.665
Due respect, Mr Taylor,
but I can't do that.

23:20.665 --> 23:23.345
He's a grown man.

23:23.345 --> 23:24.585
If he's got something
he wants to do,

23:24.745 --> 23:25.865
there's nothing
I can say about it.

23:25.945 --> 23:26.985
He's killing himself.

23:27.105 --> 23:28.985
But he's going
for what he wants.

23:30.945 --> 23:34.665
Maybe you should think about
giving him a little support.

23:42.465 --> 23:43.985
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

23:44.105 --> 23:45.345
Watch out.

23:45.465 --> 23:46.425
Maybe he hit his head.

23:46.545 --> 23:47.505
No sign of trauma.

23:47.665 --> 23:49.505
We can finish our talk later?

23:50.785 --> 23:52.345
Daria, give us
a hand, please.

23:52.545 --> 23:54.585
Oh, um, no, actually,
Dr Banfield really...

23:54.585 --> 23:56.225
Now, please.

23:56.345 --> 23:57.465
What do you think
he's altered from?

23:57.585 --> 23:59.265
Probably ingestion.

23:59.385 --> 24:00.385
Of what?

24:00.505 --> 24:01.425
Coma's pretty deep.

24:01.545 --> 24:02.825
Benzos, barbs, opiates.

24:02.985 --> 24:05.505
No pinpoint pupils,
respirations aren't suppressed.

24:05.665 --> 24:07.585
Do you want me to start a line
and draw some labs?

24:07.745 --> 24:08.865
No, Sam can do that.

24:09.025 --> 24:10.345
Actually, I think
it'd be really good

24:10.545 --> 24:11.665
for me to have
the practice.
Thank you, Daria.

24:11.665 --> 24:12.865
Sam, vitals.
Taggart:
I'm putting him

24:13.025 --> 24:14.705
on the machine now.
All right.

24:14.705 --> 24:16.544
Daria:
OK, so, um, what kind
of labs do you want?

24:16.704 --> 24:19.144
Chemistry, I want CBC,
ETOH levels,

24:19.144 --> 24:21.744
acetaminophen
and aspirin, please.

24:21.944 --> 24:23.464
Taggart:
Tony.
Huh?

24:23.624 --> 24:24.664
Looks like yours.

24:24.784 --> 24:26.744
Oh, yeah.

24:26.864 --> 24:27.984
All right, we need to scan.

24:28.104 --> 24:29.304
Can I have my light, please?

24:29.464 --> 24:30.984
Got to secure his airway.
I don't want to wait.

24:31.144 --> 24:32.424
Light, please.
My light.

24:32.504 --> 24:34.584
Yes.

24:36.424 --> 24:37.664
Daria:
Um, you know what?

24:37.784 --> 24:39.224
Seems like you two have
this under control.

24:39.224 --> 24:40.184
I'm gonna just...
Gates:
No, actually, Daria,

24:40.344 --> 24:41.824
will you stay here and check
his Babinski, please?

24:41.824 --> 24:42.944
We should give him dextrose.

24:43.104 --> 24:44.344
No, I want to do
a finger stick.

24:44.504 --> 24:45.544
It'll take
too long.

24:45.544 --> 24:47.104
Do you want me to
get some ativan?

24:47.104 --> 24:48.744
Yeah, two migs.
Mixing up dilantin.

24:48.744 --> 24:49.744
Oh!

24:49.904 --> 24:51.544
Daria:
I'm so sorry!

24:51.664 --> 24:53.384
Get the ativan!

26:39.063 --> 26:42.903
If you're starting to feel that the
only certainty is uncertainty...

26:44.063 --> 26:46.703
..and if you're just trying
to keep your head...

26:46.823 --> 26:48.303
..we're not surprised.

26:48.303 --> 26:50.143
Let's make a stand.

26:50.703 --> 26:53.183
At Axa we've stuck to
what we do best...

26:53.383 --> 26:55.943
...so we have the the kind of
financial stability that means...

26:55.943 --> 26:58.623
..we'll be keeping our head
for some time yet.

26:58.863 --> 27:02.263
Which leaves us free to concentrate
on you, our customer.

28:07.142 --> 28:10.502
# GENTLE PIANO

28:17.062 --> 28:20.022
If you think you can't
enjoy real dairy,

28:20.102 --> 28:21.342
think again.

28:21.862 --> 28:23.662
Find out
more at...

28:28.422 --> 28:29.702
You're running with me

28:33.022 --> 28:34.742
# Don't touch the ground

28:35.822 --> 28:38.222
# Though your world is changing

28:38.222 --> 28:39.542
Though your world is changing

28:39.542 --> 28:42.022
I will be... the same

28:42.022 --> 28:43.742
# Slave to love

28:44.702 --> 28:46.022
The new fragrance

28:48.862 --> 28:52.262
Some odours you just can't ignore.

28:52.262 --> 28:55.542
And while some other air fresheners
may just bury the smell

28:55.542 --> 28:58.222
in a flowery fog,

28:58.222 --> 29:02.541
Febreze Mist & Refresh actually
removes odours in the air

29:02.541 --> 29:04.061
and leaves a fresh scent,

29:04.061 --> 29:07.061
so you can freshen up, not cover up.

29:07.061 --> 29:08.781
Febreze Mist & Refresh

29:08.781 --> 29:10.301
Discover true freshness...

29:10.301 --> 29:11.781
in the air

29:11.781 --> 29:13.941
And now experience Febreze freshness

29:13.941 --> 29:15.901
in an odour eliminating candle

30:17.101 --> 30:19.821
Dilantin load's running.

30:19.981 --> 30:21.781
So his tattoo,
that means he's army, right?

30:21.901 --> 30:24.021
Yeah, a paratrooper.

30:24.141 --> 30:25.061
Same as you.

30:25.141 --> 30:26.741
Yep.

30:26.741 --> 30:28.541
Let's get some
antibiotics on board,

30:28.701 --> 30:30.581
two grams of
ceftriaxone

30:30.581 --> 30:31.621
and one gram of vanco.

30:31.741 --> 30:32.700
I think maybe we should

30:32.820 --> 30:34.100
get him on some steroids, too.

30:35.820 --> 30:38.820
Listen, I'm sorry if I hurt
your feelings earlier.

30:39.900 --> 30:41.980
Dr Gates, uh...

30:42.100 --> 30:43.700
He's waking up.

30:43.820 --> 30:45.420
(CLEARS THROAT)

30:45.540 --> 30:46.380
So steroids?

30:46.540 --> 30:48.180
Yeah, decadron,
ten milligrams.

30:48.340 --> 30:49.180
Taggart:
OK.

30:49.340 --> 30:50.580
Don't let me tell you
what to do.

30:50.740 --> 30:53.020
Don't worry,
you're not.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.060
OK.

30:58.420 --> 31:00.220
Feeling OK?

31:00.340 --> 31:01.660
Huh?

31:01.780 --> 31:03.860
How you feeling?

31:04.020 --> 31:05.660
Like I got
my bell rung.

31:05.780 --> 31:06.860
Yeah, you had a seizure.

31:07.020 --> 31:08.300
You ever had
one of those before?

31:08.380 --> 31:10.780
I don't know.

31:10.780 --> 31:12.780
Can you tell me your name?

31:13.820 --> 31:15.860
Max.

31:16.020 --> 31:16.900
And your last name?

31:17.060 --> 31:17.980
How-how'd I
get in here?

31:18.140 --> 31:19.060
Uh, last thing
I remember,

31:19.220 --> 31:20.380
I was drinking coffee.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.420
We found you passed out
on the street.

31:22.540 --> 31:25.060
Where's Jake?

31:25.180 --> 31:26.020
My dog.

31:26.140 --> 31:27.180
Um, sorry, I don't know.

31:27.340 --> 31:28.820
I haven't seen him.
I-I got to go.

31:30.140 --> 31:31.380
Wh-where's
my stuff?

31:31.540 --> 31:33.300
We got your duffel...
I got stuff I need
in my duffel.

31:33.460 --> 31:34.660
Yeah, we got it,
don't worry about it.

31:34.820 --> 31:35.900
Hey.
I-I got to go.

31:36.100 --> 31:37.500
No, no, no.
Whoa, whoa!
Jake needs me.

31:37.620 --> 31:38.500
All right. Oh, my God!

31:38.620 --> 31:39.900
OK, come on, sit down.

31:40.020 --> 31:41.100
Please...

31:41.220 --> 31:42.180
Jake!

31:42.340 --> 31:43.660
You need to stay
in bed, sir.

31:43.780 --> 31:45.300
We're gonna find him, OK?

31:45.380 --> 31:46.340
Don't worry.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.460
And neuro wants us
to send CSF for prions

31:48.620 --> 31:50.860
and HSV for our ataxic guy.
What? He's just stoned?

31:51.020 --> 31:52.180
What's wrong
with neurologists?

31:52.180 --> 31:53.700
I don't know...
That's all I've got.

31:53.900 --> 31:56.860
I've got an ingrown
toenail in three with my
name on it, so I'm...

31:56.860 --> 31:57.980
Hey, hey, hey.
Huh?

31:58.140 --> 31:59.060
Are you OK?
Yeah, no,

31:59.220 --> 32:00.420
I mean, why
wouldn't I be OK?

32:00.580 --> 32:01.980
Do I not seem okay?
You seem hasty.

32:02.100 --> 32:03.540
No. No, no.

32:03.740 --> 32:05.220
I-I'm just busy,
that's all.
OK.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.620
OK. Bye.

32:06.740 --> 32:09.339
Hey, Frank, do you have
the LFTs on my jaundice guy?

32:09.499 --> 32:11.139
Yeah. I'll...
I'll find them.

32:11.299 --> 32:12.899
Excuse me, Dr Banfield?
Mm.

32:13.059 --> 32:14.659
I can't just
stand by and watch.

32:14.739 --> 32:16.539
Uh... Here.

32:16.659 --> 32:18.219
Veal Frank-alini.

32:18.419 --> 32:21.179
I thought I told you...
Maybe you can't tell
this by looking at me...

32:21.299 --> 32:22.619
I happen to be
a culinary genius.

32:22.819 --> 32:25.019
I used to cook
for all the guys
down at the precinct

32:25.179 --> 32:26.259
all the time,
and Chicago cops

32:26.379 --> 32:27.419
know good food.

32:27.579 --> 32:30.579
Now, this is my variation
on a timeless classic.

32:30.739 --> 32:33.979
Veal scaloppini with
a chanterelle cream sauce.

32:34.059 --> 32:35.499
A little touch of heaven.

32:35.659 --> 32:37.219
Now, the key is
the chanterelles.

32:37.219 --> 32:39.259
A good chanterelle
is firm.

32:39.259 --> 32:40.739
You don't want
a soft chanterelle.

32:40.739 --> 32:42.659
Please stop saying
"chanterelle".

32:42.819 --> 32:44.619
Sorry.

32:45.899 --> 32:48.459
Thank you...Frank.

32:48.459 --> 32:50.339
You're welcome.

32:50.459 --> 32:51.699
Hey, you.

32:54.019 --> 32:55.779
Russ, wh-what are
you doing here?

32:55.939 --> 32:57.579
Didn't like the way
we left things.

32:57.739 --> 32:59.259
You-you got a minute?
No, I don't.

32:59.419 --> 33:01.059
I'm busy.
You should've called.

33:01.219 --> 33:02.699
I've been trying
your cell all day.

33:02.899 --> 33:04.259
Left messages...
Well, you know

33:04.379 --> 33:06.059
you just can't show up
at work like this.

33:06.219 --> 33:07.939
I need to talk to you.
Well, not here.

33:08.059 --> 33:10.179
Cate...

33:10.299 --> 33:11.299
Uh...

33:11.459 --> 33:13.819
Sorry, I can
come back later.

33:13.819 --> 33:15.299
What is it, Doctor?

33:15.459 --> 33:18.179
My husband,
Russell Banfield.

33:18.339 --> 33:19.979
Hello. I'm Neela Rasgotra.
Nice to meet you.

33:20.139 --> 33:21.899
You, too.
Would you wait
for me outside,

33:22.019 --> 33:23.139
please?

33:29.019 --> 33:30.739
(EXHALES)
Um,

33:30.939 --> 33:33.859
you know, it...
really can wait.
I didn't mean to...

33:33.979 --> 33:35.419
I'm here now. Go.

33:35.419 --> 33:38.819
OK. Uh, so,
I spoke to Dr Dubenko,

33:38.979 --> 33:41.939
and he feels that
I should handle our...

33:42.059 --> 33:43.858
issue on my own, especially...

33:44.098 --> 33:46.298
Woman:
Dr Banfield?
You know what, Dr Rasgotra?

33:46.418 --> 33:48.098
We'll do it your way, hmm?

33:48.298 --> 33:50.098
Make things
nice and easy for you.

33:50.258 --> 33:53.258
And you let me know if
there's anything else I can do.

33:55.098 --> 33:57.018
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
What happened here?

33:57.178 --> 33:58.898
Rugby match.
You win?

33:59.058 --> 34:01.698
23-6. I think that
qualifies as a massacre.

34:01.778 --> 34:03.098
Can't we get on with this?

34:03.218 --> 34:04.658
All I really need
is a drink.

34:04.818 --> 34:06.218
Yeah, I'll get you
wrapped up.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.178
We'll get some ibuprofen
and some ice.

34:08.338 --> 34:09.898
Hey, uh, you should come
celebrate with us,

34:10.018 --> 34:11.858
bring some of your pretty
little nurse friends along.

34:12.018 --> 34:14.618
I don't think my surgeon friends
would be interested.

34:14.737 --> 34:16.338
Well, we're gonna
head over to Ike's.

34:16.338 --> 34:19.297
Stop by if you're free.
Yeah, maybe you could
have a spot of tea.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.458
You know, leave
the real drinking to us.

34:23.898 --> 34:26.938
Dawn:
Unasyn finally came up
from the pharmacy.

34:27.058 --> 34:29.777
Yo, med student,
what's up, man?

34:29.938 --> 34:31.978
You graduate yet?
Not yet.

34:32.178 --> 34:34.138
Louie:
How much longer you
gonna keep us down here?

34:34.138 --> 34:35.578
Thought you said
he needed surgery.
He's next. I'm sorry.

34:35.777 --> 34:37.498
They're swamped
with emergency cases.
But isn't he an emergency?

34:37.658 --> 34:39.618
I mean, look at him.
Give the guy a break, Pop.

34:39.618 --> 34:42.257
It's OK. Gives me time to
do a full neural assessment.

34:42.418 --> 34:44.658
Chaz, will you cover
that eye for me, please?
Sure.

34:44.818 --> 34:46.898
OK, I want you
to look into my eye

34:47.058 --> 34:51.297
and not move yours, and tell me
when you see my finger moving.

34:51.418 --> 34:52.257
Now.

34:52.378 --> 34:53.418
All right.

34:53.578 --> 34:55.978
Tell me again
when you see it moving.

35:00.658 --> 35:03.258
How about now?

35:04.498 --> 35:05.738
Now.

35:07.138 --> 35:08.538
There's a visual field deficit.

35:08.698 --> 35:10.298
Translate.
Well, your retina's fine,

35:10.458 --> 35:13.098
which means it could be
a problem in your brain.

35:13.218 --> 35:14.458
What?

35:14.618 --> 35:16.778
Whoa, you said
my brain was Ok.
Well, it might

35:16.938 --> 35:18.697
be something called
a diffuse axonal injury.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.617
It doesn't show up on a CT.

35:20.777 --> 35:22.457
Usually happens
with repetitive head trauma.

35:22.537 --> 35:23.657
You mean like getting

35:23.777 --> 35:24.977
punched over and over again!

35:25.137 --> 35:26.297
Pop...
Which is why you keep

35:26.497 --> 35:28.057
getting hit by all
those shots, man.

35:28.057 --> 35:29.617
Look, I could step in there
and take you out.

35:29.777 --> 35:31.577
Imagine what somebody
half my age would do.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.217
He's got brain damage, right?

35:33.377 --> 35:35.497
Well, we need to get an MRI
to be sure.

35:35.697 --> 35:39.217
You can't keep doing this
to yourself, Derrek.
I'm doing this for us.

35:39.217 --> 35:40.697
This doesn't do
us any good, son!

35:40.817 --> 35:43.017
Pulse ox is down.

35:43.017 --> 35:43.937
What's going on, huh?

35:43.937 --> 35:45.257
What's going on?!

35:45.377 --> 35:46.377
My chest...

35:46.497 --> 35:47.977
Where? Where?

35:48.097 --> 35:49.457
The left...

35:49.617 --> 35:50.897
Decreased breath sounds -
let's get him to trauma.

35:51.017 --> 35:52.257
I'll get the
non-rebreather.

35:53.337 --> 35:55.657
Derrek?

35:55.777 --> 35:57.777
Derrek?

36:00.977 --> 36:02.937
Best I could do.

36:04.217 --> 36:05.937
Got you an extra jell-o.

36:07.777 --> 36:08.417
Is there anyone

36:08.417 --> 36:09.577
we can contact for you?

36:09.577 --> 36:11.217
Family or friends?

36:11.217 --> 36:13.737
Just Jake.

36:13.857 --> 36:15.537
I'm fine on my own.

36:15.657 --> 36:16.577
Yeah, well,

36:16.577 --> 36:18.617
you don't seem fine.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.697
No-one likes to be alone
all the time.

36:21.697 --> 36:23.897
What do you know?
I've been on my own
most of my life.

36:23.897 --> 36:27.017
But it is up to me to fix that.

36:27.017 --> 36:30.217
You know?

36:30.377 --> 36:33.937
Well, could I...could I get
some mustard or something?

36:36.697 --> 36:40.017
The incision is along the
fifth rib, midaxillary line.

36:40.097 --> 36:41.297
All right?

36:41.377 --> 36:43.257
Tunnel superiorly

36:43.377 --> 36:44.897
to the next interspace.

36:45.057 --> 36:47.537
Curved vascular clamp
around the tube.

36:47.697 --> 36:49.217
You know what?
you should push it through.

36:49.337 --> 36:50.617
No, that's OK.
Dr Banfield said

36:50.617 --> 36:51.617
I shouldn't
touch anything.

36:51.617 --> 36:53.016
I did the whole
procedure, all right?

36:53.176 --> 36:55.776
We'll push it in together,
just so you can get the feel.

36:55.936 --> 36:57.736
Wait, wait, time out.
He's a student here, right?

36:57.896 --> 36:59.776
This is a teaching
hospital, sir.

36:59.896 --> 37:01.096
Right here.

37:01.256 --> 37:03.056
Just above
the rib line.

37:03.056 --> 37:04.096
Right there.

37:04.096 --> 37:05.416
Heard you guys needed help.

37:05.416 --> 37:08.536
I'm sorry if this
hurts a little, man.

37:09.976 --> 37:11.776
OK. It takes a little force to get
through the muscle.

37:11.776 --> 37:13.216
Dr Morris, shouldn't
Chaz be observing?

37:13.216 --> 37:14.696
He's assisting.

37:15.816 --> 37:17.696
Feel it?
Mmm-hmm.

37:17.696 --> 37:19.096
Push it in.

37:19.096 --> 37:21.856
Harder.

37:21.856 --> 37:23.416
A little harder.

37:23.416 --> 37:25.216
Harder.

37:25.216 --> 37:26.856
(GULPS)

37:28.416 --> 37:30.136
Pulse ox coming up.
Strong pulse.

37:30.136 --> 37:31.696
Way to go, Chaz!

37:31.696 --> 37:35.056
Now...we just sew it in.

37:35.056 --> 37:36.376
You mean you sew it in.

37:36.376 --> 37:38.376
Yes.

37:38.376 --> 37:40.976
Oh, silk.

37:40.976 --> 37:42.016
The thoraseal...

37:42.016 --> 37:43.696
Dropped his pressure again.

37:43.696 --> 37:45.496
500 cc's.
What are you guys doing?

37:45.496 --> 37:47.616
Hang two units of blood.

37:47.616 --> 37:48.736
I thought you said he
had a collapsed lung.

37:52.856 --> 37:53.936
Morris?

37:53.936 --> 37:56.096
We bagged an intercostal artery.

37:56.096 --> 37:59.296
Chaz...when you pushed
the tube in, did it slip?

37:59.296 --> 38:00.896
No.
Huh?

38:00.896 --> 38:02.256
I-I don't know. Maybe.

38:02.256 --> 38:03.896
He's not breathing.
What?

38:03.896 --> 38:05.616
Intubation tray.
Page surgery.

38:07.656 --> 38:08.896
Derrek?

38:24.576 --> 38:26.536
Honey, I... I've been
out here for half an hour.

38:26.536 --> 38:29.735
I'm busy. You
should've called.

38:29.735 --> 38:30.815
You know I don't
like people knowing
my business.

38:30.815 --> 38:33.215
How can you work
in that place?
I know you didn't

38:33.215 --> 38:34.695
pull me out here
to talk about this.

38:34.695 --> 38:36.855
Russ...

38:36.855 --> 38:38.455
Please, my board is full.

38:38.455 --> 38:41.735
I made
dinner reservations.

38:41.735 --> 38:44.775
Mia Francesca,
your favourite.
We are not going to dinner.

38:44.775 --> 38:46.335
They'll be at our place
in about an hour.

38:46.335 --> 38:47.415
That's not what
I meant, damn it.

38:47.415 --> 38:49.415
I'm going to cook, OK?
I will cook!

38:49.415 --> 38:51.135
I thought you
didn't have time.

38:51.135 --> 38:52.935
I know what I said.
I'm just trying

38:52.935 --> 38:54.935
to make things
easier for you.
By making your mother

38:54.935 --> 38:56.295
think that I
can't make dinner

38:56.295 --> 38:57.655
or keep a home?

38:57.655 --> 38:59.335
That won't make a damn
thing easier, believe me.

38:59.335 --> 39:00.895
Baby, I'm sorry.

39:00.895 --> 39:02.215
I'm just trying to help.

39:03.615 --> 39:05.415
All right, I'll
be there at 7:30.

40:07.254 --> 40:09.694
Gary Rhodes is on a mission
to find out which tastes better -

40:09.854 --> 40:12.454
Flora Buttery or a leading
spreadable from a butter brand.

40:12.614 --> 40:14.094
- Which one is your favourite?
- I think that one.

40:14.254 --> 40:15.854
- Why is that?
- It seems a bit more creamy.

40:15.974 --> 40:17.054
Shall I reveal?

40:17.174 --> 40:19.414
His findings confirmed ours -

40:19.574 --> 40:21.374
more people prefer the taste
of Flora Buttery.

40:21.494 --> 40:23.374
And since it's made with seed oils,

40:23.494 --> 40:24.894
it has less saturated fat,

40:25.014 --> 40:25.814
so it's better for your heart.

40:57.134 --> 41:00.494
# GENTLE PIANO

41:07.054 --> 41:10.014
If you think you can't
enjoy real dairy,

41:10.094 --> 41:11.334
think again.

41:11.854 --> 41:13.654
Find out
more at...

42:37.133 --> 42:38.133
Charity shop's going to be happy

42:38.253 --> 42:39.533
with all this stuff
from your clear-out.

42:39.613 --> 42:40.613
Too true, Happy.

42:40.733 --> 42:42.693
We could give away
something free, too.

42:42.813 --> 42:44.893
- Contents insurance.
- What?

42:44.973 --> 42:46.453
Ooh!

42:48.573 --> 42:51.413
I thought you said
free contents insurance.

42:51.493 --> 42:52.533
Get your buildings insurance

42:52.613 --> 42:53.653
direct from Norwich Union

42:53.773 --> 42:54.773
and we'll give you
contents insurance

42:54.893 --> 42:55.813
absolutely
free.

44:18.652 --> 44:19.972
Can't get control
of the bleeder.

44:19.972 --> 44:21.692
BP's still in the toilet.
It's up inside
the costal groove.

44:21.692 --> 44:23.132
Fourth unit's going in.

44:23.132 --> 44:24.132
Come on, come on, come on!

44:25.452 --> 44:26.532
I got it.

44:26.532 --> 44:28.012
All right,
120/80, not bad.

44:28.012 --> 44:29.052
Chest tube output's way down.

44:29.052 --> 44:30.132
Surgery's here.

44:30.132 --> 44:31.452
- Where's Neela?
- Gone for the day.

44:31.452 --> 44:33.092
- Crenshaw's on.
- Get in here, keep your
finger on the vessel.

44:33.092 --> 44:34.892
You got it.
Is he gonna be okay?

44:34.892 --> 44:36.972
We got to get him up to surgery.
What's going on?

44:36.972 --> 44:40.132
We tore an intercostal,
but he's stable now.

44:40.132 --> 44:41.212
And how'd you tear an
intercostal doing a chest tube?

44:44.572 --> 44:45.532
Must've slipped.

44:48.731 --> 44:50.211
It happens.
OR's ready for him.

44:50.211 --> 44:52.451
Should be an
interesting M and M.
Stay ahead four units.

44:52.451 --> 44:53.851
I'll call the blood bank.
Hey, Morris, you got a second?

44:53.851 --> 44:55.611
He's got an 18-gauge
in each arm.

44:55.611 --> 44:56.731
Get something central.

44:56.731 --> 44:58.291
Come here.

44:58.291 --> 45:00.011
What the hell are you doing?

45:00.011 --> 45:02.011
Chaz isn't trained
to do chest tubes.
This is his first year.

45:02.011 --> 45:04.931
He has EMT experience.
They don't do chest tubes
out in the field.

45:04.931 --> 45:07.451
I was trying to teach him,
give him a head start, you know?

45:07.451 --> 45:08.451
By letting him
kill a patient?

45:08.451 --> 45:10.291
You put him in a situation
he wasn't ready for.

45:10.291 --> 45:12.011
That's not giving him a head
start, that's setting him back.

45:36.531 --> 45:37.571
Hey! Look who it is!

45:37.571 --> 45:39.211
Got a hot cup of Earl Grey
waiting for you, love.

45:39.211 --> 45:41.091
Do you take milk with that?
You made it.

45:41.091 --> 45:42.411
Well, it looks that way.

45:42.411 --> 45:44.091
I'll make you some chamomile,

45:44.091 --> 45:45.891
you know,
since it's almost bedtime!

45:45.891 --> 45:47.251
Let's get you a drink.

45:47.251 --> 45:50.571
Hey, I am so sorry that I
barged in the other night.

45:50.571 --> 45:51.971
I didn't realize that
you and Ray were...

45:51.971 --> 45:53.571
Oh, no, not at all,
it's fine.

45:53.571 --> 45:55.731
He and I, we're friends,
he was in town,

45:55.731 --> 45:57.171
we were catching up,
so we're good.
OK.

45:57.171 --> 45:59.971
Oh, uh, Jimmy, another
round for my mates

45:59.971 --> 46:01.531
and whatever
she's drinking.

46:03.171 --> 46:05.091
Hey, Max. How you doing?

46:06.691 --> 46:07.931
Your CAT scan
looks good.

46:07.931 --> 46:08.891
OK.

46:11.131 --> 46:12.531
So, you don't remember
anything like this

46:12.531 --> 46:13.531
happening to you before?

46:13.531 --> 46:15.091
I forget lots of stuff.

46:15.091 --> 46:16.091
No head injury,

46:16.091 --> 46:18.731
anything, maybe, uh, epilepsy?

46:21.450 --> 46:22.970
Now, could I get a sandwich?

46:22.970 --> 46:26.090
That nurse lady brought me one,
but I'm still kind of hungry.

46:26.090 --> 46:27.490
Sure, no problem.

46:29.810 --> 46:32.290
Can you remember
your last name for me?

46:32.290 --> 46:34.810
I tried to see it
on your duffel, but
I couldn't read it.

46:36.690 --> 46:38.530
All right.

46:38.530 --> 46:40.530
Well, you let me know
if you can, all right?

46:40.530 --> 46:41.930
What about this ink
on your chest?

46:43.650 --> 46:45.290
Paratrooper?

46:45.290 --> 46:46.890
Oh, yeah.

46:48.450 --> 46:49.530
Thing hurt.

46:49.530 --> 46:51.890
I got one, too.

46:51.890 --> 46:54.170
101st Airborne.

46:54.170 --> 46:55.770
Screaming Eagles.

46:55.770 --> 46:57.130
Right.

46:57.130 --> 46:58.210
Where'd you get yours?

46:59.850 --> 47:01.170
This dude.

47:03.250 --> 47:05.210
Max, do you remember
where you served?

47:07.050 --> 47:08.450
Tal Afar.

47:09.770 --> 47:11.330
Hot as hell.
Yeah, up north

47:11.330 --> 47:13.490
by Mosul, right?

47:24.490 --> 47:28.290
Tony, the homeless guy
you were just in with...
Yeah?

47:28.290 --> 47:30.170
Neuro wants to discharge him.

47:30.170 --> 47:32.850
Outpatient EEG
and clinic referral.

47:32.850 --> 47:34.490
He won't get his
dilantin filled.

47:34.490 --> 47:35.490
He'll never
make it back here...

47:35.490 --> 47:36.530
Sam, I took care of it.

47:36.530 --> 47:37.970
You did?

47:37.970 --> 47:39.050
Yep. Pulled some strings,

47:39.050 --> 47:40.610
and got him admitted to
the Neuro service.

47:40.610 --> 47:43.410
Oh. OK.

47:43.410 --> 47:45.210
Well, there you go.

47:45.210 --> 47:46.610
There you go.

47:46.610 --> 47:48.290
Listen, I feel like...

47:48.290 --> 47:49.330
Hey, Mom.

47:49.330 --> 47:50.850
Hey, you're early.

47:50.850 --> 47:52.690
What's up, Tony?

47:52.690 --> 47:53.810
Alex, how you doing?

47:53.810 --> 47:54.850
I'm good.

47:54.850 --> 47:55.929
Hey, can we go eat?

47:55.929 --> 47:58.089
Uh, yeah. Let me
get my stuff.

47:58.089 --> 47:59.809
See you tomorrow.

47:59.809 --> 48:00.849
Later, Ton.

48:00.849 --> 48:02.049
Night.

48:07.409 --> 48:08.529
Daria, before you leave,

48:08.529 --> 48:10.529
can you get a read on my
pericarditis guy's echo?

48:10.529 --> 48:11.609
Yeah, no problem.

48:11.609 --> 48:12.609
Dr Gates?

48:12.609 --> 48:14.569
I was, uh...

48:14.569 --> 48:15.769
I was just wondering,
I wanted to make sure

48:15.769 --> 48:16.849
that everything
was OK.

48:18.369 --> 48:19.929
You know, with you and Sam.

48:19.929 --> 48:21.769
Yeah, everything's fine.

48:21.769 --> 48:23.649
Oh, OK.

48:23.649 --> 48:25.209
Yeah, that's...
well, no, that's great.

48:25.209 --> 48:27.809
Um, it was just because,
you know, earlier

48:27.809 --> 48:28.969
things got a little bit weird.

48:28.969 --> 48:31.489
Not bad-weird per se.

48:31.489 --> 48:32.849
They just got a
little bit weird.

48:32.849 --> 48:34.689
And so I just wanted
to make sure that...

48:36.409 --> 48:38.369
Yeah, but everything's
OK, so that's great.

48:38.369 --> 48:40.209
Yeah. You good?
Yeah.

48:40.209 --> 48:41.689
You sure?
Totally.

48:41.689 --> 48:43.609
Cos you're blushing again.

48:45.089 --> 48:47.449
OK. I'll see you tomorrow.

48:53.129 --> 48:54.769
Oh... Oh, hi.

48:54.769 --> 48:55.849
So you're ready
for sign outs?

48:55.849 --> 48:57.929
After you tell me
how today went.

48:57.929 --> 49:00.889
Did Dr Gates
instruct you well?

49:00.889 --> 49:01.969
You know what, these
are the pass ons.

49:01.969 --> 49:03.409
Good night.

49:04.489 --> 49:06.489
Somebody had a poopy day.

49:08.289 --> 49:09.329
You sure?

49:09.329 --> 49:10.489
I don't know.

49:10.489 --> 49:11.649
Are you sure?

49:11.649 --> 49:13.809
I mean, what else
are we going to do?

49:13.809 --> 49:14.929
A lot of things.

49:14.929 --> 49:16.889
We can go
to a hotel...
Mom, you hate hotels.

49:16.889 --> 49:19.409
Hey, sorry to interrupt,
but since I am,

49:19.409 --> 49:21.409
I want to tell you,
both of you that...

49:21.409 --> 49:23.729
that I want you to
come stay with me.

49:23.729 --> 49:26.769
Because I really
like you guys.

49:26.769 --> 49:28.529
And... And I know
it's fast,

49:28.529 --> 49:29.569
but you know what,
if it doesn't work out,

49:29.569 --> 49:31.328
then you guys
can just move out, you know?

49:31.328 --> 49:32.808
I just think we'd
be great together.

49:32.808 --> 49:34.448
I think we'd
all be great,
all of us.

49:34.448 --> 49:37.008
And Sarah's totally
on board

49:37.008 --> 49:38.088
and I have a
flat-screen TV

49:38.088 --> 49:39.448
and I live in a
great neighbourhood...

49:39.448 --> 49:42.968
Tony, we were actually
just talking about it.

49:44.168 --> 49:45.648
We're in.

49:45.648 --> 49:47.208
You are?

49:47.208 --> 49:49.448
Uh-huh. Right?

49:49.448 --> 49:51.088
You had me at flat screen.

49:51.088 --> 49:54.968
All right, all right...
Shut up, shut up.

49:54.968 --> 49:56.048
No pressure now, huh?

49:56.048 --> 49:57.128
Just don't miss.
Don't miss.

49:57.128 --> 49:58.168
Calm it... Calm it down.
Oh!

50:00.408 --> 50:02.448
Yes!
Yes!

50:02.448 --> 50:04.968
Oh, thank you.
And thank you.

50:04.968 --> 50:06.208
And thank you.

50:06.208 --> 50:07.848
Green is my favourite colour.

50:07.848 --> 50:09.448
Don't worry about it. It is
a British game after all.

50:09.448 --> 50:11.288
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
and God Save The
Queen and all that.

50:11.288 --> 50:12.368
She's your Queen too, you know.

50:12.368 --> 50:14.448
Excuse me, who invited
the Brit? You did.

50:14.448 --> 50:15.488
Sore loser.

50:15.488 --> 50:16.488
Shut up.

50:16.488 --> 50:18.888
Oh, what'd you just
say to me, convict?

50:18.888 --> 50:20.728
Again, that's all right.

50:20.728 --> 50:21.768
It's my shout.

50:21.768 --> 50:22.968
Who's drinking?

50:22.968 --> 50:24.288
I am if you're buying.

50:24.288 --> 50:27.128
All right, Jimmy.

50:29.288 --> 50:30.928
So, surgery went well.

50:32.768 --> 50:34.528
I'm doing OK,
then, right?

50:34.528 --> 50:35.528
Well, your lung
will heal

50:35.528 --> 50:36.568
and so will your face.

50:36.568 --> 50:39.088
But the damage

50:39.088 --> 50:40.928
from repeated head trauma,
that won't heal.

50:40.928 --> 50:43.328
See? You got to
stop this mess.

50:43.328 --> 50:44.728
Pop, please.

50:44.728 --> 50:46.568
Just let the man talk.

50:51.448 --> 50:53.288
Your dad's right.

50:53.288 --> 50:55.128
Boxing is just not a good idea.

50:55.128 --> 50:59.968
You saying I can't fight...

50:59.968 --> 51:02.648
I-I know you think that
you don't have a choice...

51:02.648 --> 51:04.688
You don't know what I think.
I know that you
want to do

51:04.688 --> 51:06.887
whatever it takes
to help your dad.

51:06.887 --> 51:10.647
To make him proud.

51:10.647 --> 51:11.727
But if you keep fighting,

51:11.727 --> 51:13.807
you are risking
serious brain damage.

51:18.887 --> 51:20.287
I know I've been tough on you.

51:23.207 --> 51:24.407
I'm sorry.

51:28.327 --> 51:30.007
I take full
responsibility for that.

51:32.847 --> 51:35.727
But where you go from
here is up to you, Derrek.

51:37.167 --> 51:39.607
You got nothing to prove.

51:42.927 --> 51:44.767
What're we gonna do, Pop?

51:46.727 --> 51:50.127
We'll find a way, like always.

51:50.127 --> 51:53.167
We'll figure
it out.

52:09.127 --> 52:10.727
I'll come back,
check on you later.

52:12.247 --> 52:13.727
Hey, doc.

52:13.727 --> 52:16.207
Thank you.

52:25.807 --> 52:28.967
Dr Banfield, I thought you
were gone for the night.

52:28.967 --> 52:31.007
I needed to follow up.

52:31.007 --> 52:32.447
You don't have
to check up on me.

52:32.447 --> 52:35.407
I was checking up
on your patient.

52:35.407 --> 52:36.887
Right, my patient.

52:36.887 --> 52:38.207
Yes, who thankfully survived

52:38.207 --> 52:40.047
your little therapeutic
misadventure today.

52:50.406 --> 52:51.966
May I ask you a question?

52:53.726 --> 52:56.086
How can such a good doctor
be such a knucklehead?

53:00.206 --> 53:01.886
I thought Chaz was different.

53:03.006 --> 53:04.286
It was a mistake.

53:09.166 --> 53:10.446
After Greg Pratt died,

53:10.446 --> 53:13.646
I...lost some focus.

53:18.126 --> 53:21.206
I'm working on it.

53:27.326 --> 53:29.446
Well, I hope you find
clarity soon.

53:36.606 --> 53:38.006
Dr Morris.

53:39.286 --> 53:40.326
Good night.

53:40.326 --> 53:42.806
Good night.

53:44.926 --> 53:45.926
Dr Banfield!

53:46.686 --> 53:49.126
Oh, I'm glad I caught you.

53:49.126 --> 53:50.286
Here's everything you need.

53:50.286 --> 53:51.326
Veal, cream, chanterelles.

53:51.326 --> 53:52.366
You'll never find good ones.

53:52.366 --> 53:54.006
I've got a guy.

53:54.006 --> 53:55.686
No, Frank, I can't
accept that from you.
Please.

53:55.686 --> 53:57.646
I insist.

54:02.006 --> 54:04.606
Let me know how it turns out.
Frank!

54:06.086 --> 54:07.966
Remember this never happened.

54:28.045 --> 54:29.005
Hey, man.

54:32.885 --> 54:34.325
So, how was your first day?

54:37.725 --> 54:38.765
I'm so sorry about
that chest tube.

54:38.765 --> 54:41.685
Dude, don't worry about it.
He's gonna be fine.

54:41.685 --> 54:44.325
All the interns hate me.

54:44.325 --> 54:45.805
No, they don't hate you.

54:45.805 --> 54:47.245
They probably hate me,
but not you.

54:47.245 --> 54:52.205
Listen, all that
stuff, my fault.

54:52.205 --> 54:53.965
I'm the one that
should be sorry.

54:57.965 --> 55:03.045
It's just, every time I see
you, I see your brother.

55:03.045 --> 55:06.885
And he was a hell
of a doctor.

55:06.885 --> 55:09.565
And you will be, too,
one day,

55:09.565 --> 55:12.365
but you've got a ways
to go, and I forgot that.

55:14.445 --> 55:16.685
So, today, chalk it up.

55:18.845 --> 55:21.005
It's your first step
on a thousand-mile journey.

55:26.925 --> 55:28.485
I really appreciate you
looking out for me.

55:28.485 --> 55:32.005
That's what Greg
used to do.

55:39.245 --> 55:41.205
Hey, I'm off soon.

55:41.205 --> 55:43.445
I was gonna go
grab a burger.

55:43.445 --> 55:44.645
Forgot to eat today.

55:44.645 --> 55:45.885
You want to come?

55:45.885 --> 55:47.045
Sure.

55:47.045 --> 55:48.765
I'd like that.

55:48.765 --> 55:50.245
Cool.

56:16.764 --> 56:18.924
Hi.

56:22.524 --> 56:25.004
They're here.

56:34.884 --> 56:36.164
Cate? Is that you?

56:36.164 --> 56:37.844
It's me.

56:40.244 --> 56:41.644
Hi.

56:41.644 --> 56:44.204
George, get down here!
Cate's here!

56:44.204 --> 56:45.444
Oh, it's so good

56:45.444 --> 56:47.364
to see you, baby.

56:49.564 --> 56:50.724
Let's get inside.

56:50.724 --> 56:51.564
It-It's freezing.

59:19.162 --> 59:21.242
New Always with Silk

59:21.242 --> 59:22.722
The touch of silk

59:22.722 --> 59:25.922
but now with the reassurance
of our Secureguard contours

59:25.922 --> 59:28.082
Have a happy period. Always

59:30.842 --> 59:34.242
Some odours you just can't ignore.

59:34.242 --> 59:37.522
And while some other air fresheners
may just bury the smell

59:37.522 --> 59:40.202
in a flowery fog,

59:40.202 --> 59:44.522
Febreze Mist & Refresh actually
removes odours in the air

59:44.522 --> 59:46.042
and leaves a fresh scent,

59:46.042 --> 59:49.042
so you can freshen up, not cover up.

59:49.042 --> 59:50.762
Febreze Mist & Refresh

59:50.762 --> 59:52.282
Discover true freshness...

59:52.282 --> 59:53.762
in the air

59:53.762 --> 59:55.922
And now experience Febreze freshness

59:55.922 --> 59:57.882
in an odour eliminating candle
