02:13.400 --> 02:16.000
Horatio...

02:16.060 --> 02:18.200
this boy is Cuban.

02:19.230 --> 02:21.130
It's not surprising,Alexx.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.960
This is a popular entry point for refugees.

02:25.030 --> 02:28.530
Poor baby,he lived the American dream for about one second.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.500
Horatio,

02:30.560 --> 02:32.400
I think I found something.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.930
Frank,that looks like a pressure plate from a land mine.

02:40.130 --> 02:42.430
Well,it explains all this

02:42.500 --> 02:45.000
plastic frag in the body.

02:45.060 --> 02:47.430
They say Miami beaches still have land mines

02:47.500 --> 02:49.100
left over from the Cuban Missile Crisis.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.860
I thought that was a myth.

02:50.930 --> 02:52.230
Somebody could be using that myth

02:52.300 --> 02:54.530
to disguise a murder,Frank.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.500
Well,he should've done his homework.

02:56.560 --> 02:59.330
I'll call the Coast Guard.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.060
See if they can find that missing boat.

03:01.130 --> 03:02.030
Okay,do it.

03:14.330 --> 03:15.430
Frank.

03:16.860 --> 03:18.960
Don't move.

04:35.180 --> 04:36.780
Whoa,whoa.

04:36.850 --> 04:38.780
Easy,Frank. Easy.

04:38.850 --> 04:40.710
Sorry.

04:46.150 --> 04:47.850
Horatio,you should take cover.

04:47.910 --> 04:50.010
Frank,I'm staying right here.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.610
That's the Torch,isn't it?

04:51.680 --> 04:54.450
It's the most effective way.

04:54.510 --> 04:56.380
Uses aluminum, barium nitrate,and PVC

04:56.450 --> 04:57.810
to burn out the mine's TNT

04:57.880 --> 04:59.480
without detonating it.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.650
That's why you've got the detective's legs covered,right?

05:01.710 --> 05:04.650
High temp silica. Protects up to 2,700 degrees.

05:04.710 --> 05:06.310
You know,we don't usually defuse these things

05:06.380 --> 05:07.610
with someone standing on it.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.710
We've taken every precaution.

05:09.780 --> 05:11.180
He's gonna be all right, isn't he?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.080
You're gonna be all right, Frank.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.180
It's getting hot. I think it's gonna blow.

05:29.250 --> 05:30.410
Why don't you get out of here.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.250
No,the heat means it's working- don't move.

05:32.310 --> 05:34.150
Frank,we're almost there.

05:47.610 --> 05:50.680
It's all right. You can step off now.

05:51.850 --> 05:53.410
Frank,you're okay.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.880
Are you absolutely sure?

05:54.950 --> 05:57.410
Go ahead.

06:14.580 --> 06:17.850
Well,that's a hell of a way to start the day.

06:17.910 --> 06:20.280
And it's only 8:00.

06:20.350 --> 06:21.480
Yeah.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.680
Wow.

06:31.110 --> 06:32.980
Fire in the hole!

06:37.980 --> 06:40.050
My God. They just blew up the three other mines.

06:40.110 --> 06:42.880
Yeah,well,it's the easiest way to counter-charge them.

06:42.950 --> 06:44.410
I understand,but we need them for evidence.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.980
How are we going to find out the signature?

06:46.050 --> 06:47.610
The Bomb Squad will sift through the pieces.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.010
Don't worry,they'll send them to Calleigh.

06:59.810 --> 07:01.550
You don't think the plastic components

07:01.610 --> 07:02.850
are going to be trashed?

07:02.910 --> 07:04.280
That's why,my friend,

07:04.350 --> 07:07.550
we have to find something else to go on.

07:12.050 --> 07:13.680
These tire treads, they look too small

07:13.750 --> 07:16.480
to be from a county vehicle,don't you think?

07:16.550 --> 07:18.280
Yeah,dark to light, that means acceleration.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.450
So maybe our bomber made a fast getaway.

07:20.510 --> 07:21.980
Well,we're gonna find out.

07:30.850 --> 07:33.180
I think I found something.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.480
Looks like some sort of eyepiece.

07:35.550 --> 07:38.510
Binoculars?

07:38.580 --> 07:39.950
Yeah.

07:40.010 --> 07:41.910
Maybe we've got a witness.

07:41.980 --> 07:46.050
Or we've got a killer who likes to watch.

08:14.350 --> 08:16.350
* *

08:21.480 --> 08:23.480
Here are the results from the stomach contents.

08:23.550 --> 08:24.950
Great.

08:25.010 --> 08:27.250
Is the the frag from our Cuban gentleman? Yeah.

08:27.310 --> 08:30.510
Oh,good,I'm gonna add it to what I get from the beach.

08:30.580 --> 08:32.549
You know,it was actually the frag that killed him,

08:32.610 --> 08:34.179
well,in a way.

08:34.250 --> 08:35.750
Really? How's that?

08:35.809 --> 08:37.409
When he stepped on that land mine,

08:37.480 --> 08:39.309
the shock went straight up his legs.

08:39.380 --> 08:40.780
His feet get the worst of it.

08:40.850 --> 08:43.350
But that blast actually blew one of his

08:43.409 --> 08:45.850
metatarsals right into his lung.

08:53.410 --> 08:55.650
If you don't mind my asking,

08:55.710 --> 08:58.110
since you know how he was killed and when he was killed,

08:58.180 --> 09:00.050
why did you send the stomach contents to Trace?

09:00.110 --> 09:01.550
Calleigh,

09:01.610 --> 09:03.780
gut feeling- okay no pun intended.

09:03.850 --> 09:06.850
But this guy is in amazing shape.

09:06.910 --> 09:08.350
And his clothes...

09:08.410 --> 09:10.680
he just seemed too nice for a refugee.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.210
Well,you're right. His stomach contents were lobster,

09:13.280 --> 09:14.780
caviar,and maraschino cherries.

09:14.850 --> 09:17.880
Yeah,definitely not rationed food.

09:17.950 --> 09:19.810
I bet if you have money, you can buy your way

09:19.880 --> 09:22.050
to the top of Cuba's visa list.

09:22.110 --> 09:24.810
So why go by boat in the middle of the night?

09:24.880 --> 09:28.450
I don't know. But I'm gonna find out.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.280
Hey,hot stuff.

09:38.350 --> 09:40.580
I thought this was your day off.

09:40.650 --> 09:41.810
Yeah,they called me in to testify,

09:41.880 --> 09:43.950
but I'm done now,so...

09:44.010 --> 09:45.750
Too guilty to take a day off?

09:45.810 --> 09:47.610
You're the same way, you know how it is.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.280
That's true. What are you working on?

09:50.350 --> 09:52.580
A Cuban refugee stepped on a land mine this morning.

09:52.650 --> 09:54.480
It's not the typical case.

09:54.550 --> 09:56.080
It seems the refugee had quite a bit of money.

09:56.150 --> 09:58.350
Really? Well,if he had a lot of money,

09:58.410 --> 10:00.310
someone would've been waiting for him.

10:00.380 --> 10:02.050
Look,I know a bar

10:02.110 --> 10:03.650
where Cubans go to get help with their citizenship papers.

10:03.710 --> 10:05.180
Really,where?

10:05.250 --> 10:07.950
Somewhere you'd have a little trouble fitting in.

10:08.010 --> 10:09.810
You have a picture?

10:10.810 --> 10:12.980
You sure? It's your day off.

10:13.050 --> 10:14.910
No,no. I'll go. It's on my way home.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.280
All right. All right.

10:16.350 --> 10:17.910
I'll call you if I get anything.

10:34.810 --> 10:36.610
He doesn't look familiar.

10:36.680 --> 10:39.680
You expecting any Cuban refugees this morning?

10:39.750 --> 10:41.110
Whoa,man,come on.

10:41.180 --> 10:42.350
Illegals?

10:42.410 --> 10:43.680
I don't know anything about that.

10:43.750 --> 10:44.980
I just serve the drinks.

10:45.050 --> 10:47.610
My man,everybody knows this is the first stop

10:47.680 --> 10:50.710
off the boat for papers and jobs.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.910
Must be thinking of some other place.

10:53.950 --> 10:55.010
Just leave me alone.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.780
Every night I pick you up from here

10:56.850 --> 10:57.950
and I pay the tab.

10:58.010 --> 10:59.010
I am tired of it.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.080
Then stop picking me up.

11:01.150 --> 11:03.080
How about you stop drinking?

11:09.910 --> 11:11.450
Touch me again, I swear I'll kill you!

11:12.750 --> 11:14.180
Hey!

11:21.080 --> 11:22.380
No!

11:23.580 --> 11:24.550
Hey!

11:24.610 --> 11:25.850
Get the cops on the phone!

11:25.910 --> 11:27.550
I thought you were the cops.

11:27.610 --> 11:29.050
Just tell them an off-duty officer needs assistance.

11:32.910 --> 11:34.550
Are you okay?

11:34.610 --> 11:36.680
Are you okay? I think you're bleeding. I'll be fine.

11:36.750 --> 11:37.980
I'm okay.

11:38.050 --> 11:39.010
What are you doing with this guy?

11:39.080 --> 11:40.510
He's my husband.

11:40.580 --> 11:42.410
That's unfortunate.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.350
We're usually not like this.

11:44.410 --> 11:45.410
You're lucky you're a cop.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.380
Huh? I'm not a cop now.

11:47.450 --> 11:48.450
You want to do something?

11:48.510 --> 11:50.250
Huh? It's not even worth it.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.250
Right.

11:51.310 --> 11:52.780
That's what I thought.

11:54.580 --> 11:57.180
You got the cops?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.850
Hey.

11:58.910 --> 12:01.010
Anything on that rubber eyepiece from the beach?

12:01.080 --> 12:02.250
Yeah,I got a lot, actually.

12:02.310 --> 12:03.410
I found some epithelials.

12:03.480 --> 12:06.910
I also... got a DNA profile.

12:07.950 --> 12:09.710
Walter Dunley.

12:09.780 --> 12:11.250
Well,he's,uh, guilty of owning binoculars.

12:11.310 --> 12:12.910
Well,no,

12:12.980 --> 12:14.950
I think he might be guilty of a lot more than that.

12:15.010 --> 12:16.610
You must read on,CSI Wolfe.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.880
Harassment,

12:18.950 --> 12:20.980
vandalism, aggravated assault,

12:21.050 --> 12:22.580
hate crimes against immigrants.

12:22.650 --> 12:24.210
Yeah,I think our binocular boy might be

12:24.280 --> 12:25.410
an expert in hate crimes.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.450
He had a front-row seat for this one.

12:27.510 --> 12:29.810
Thanks, Natalia. Mm-hmm.

12:34.510 --> 12:36.880
A dead refugee on the beach.

12:36.950 --> 12:38.780
I don't know, maybe he was a bad swimmer.

12:38.850 --> 12:43.350
He was actually killed on shore,uh,by a land mine.

12:43.410 --> 12:46.010
You should know that.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.510
You were there.

12:48.580 --> 12:50.550
This is from your binoculars.

12:53.550 --> 12:55.850
I was protecting my country.

12:55.910 --> 12:58.450
Excuse me?

12:58.510 --> 13:00.510
My family has been here since before the Civil War.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.880
These Cubans- they're coming here,they're stealing our jobs,

13:02.950 --> 13:05.150
our resources,acting like they earned something.

13:05.210 --> 13:07.680
So you're playing Border Patrol with land mines?

13:07.750 --> 13:09.010
No.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.050
I was there watching for boats to come in.

13:11.110 --> 13:12.510
Call it in if I saw one.

13:12.580 --> 13:14.150
That's it.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.110
The land mines? I don't know.

13:16.180 --> 13:17.780
Another brother in arms, I guess.

13:17.850 --> 13:21.010
While you were on watch there, Paul Revere,

13:21.080 --> 13:23.580
you didn't see anyone setting them?

13:25.610 --> 13:27.680
I fell asleep.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.710
That's when I heard the explosion.

13:55.450 --> 13:57.980
So there was another refugee?

13:58.050 --> 13:59.550
Yeah,he jumped into a car.

13:59.610 --> 14:01.510
What type of car?

14:01.580 --> 14:03.310
A foreign piece,took off fast.

14:03.380 --> 14:05.310
Did you see a license plate?

14:05.380 --> 14:07.450
It was Florida,I know that.

14:07.510 --> 14:08.880
There was a three and a two,

14:08.950 --> 14:10.110
I think.

14:10.180 --> 14:11.680
H?

14:11.750 --> 14:14.580
Yeah,I think I got a lead on that car.

14:14.650 --> 14:16.810
The tire tracks from the crime scene.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.780
Do they take us anywhere,Mr. Cooper?

14:18.850 --> 14:20.110
Yeah,crime scene photos

14:20.180 --> 14:22.110
got a few bites on the Motor Vehicles uplink.

14:24.110 --> 14:27.180
18-inch tread,Porsche design.

14:27.250 --> 14:30.050
Walter Dunley drives a Ford pickup,doesn't he?

14:30.110 --> 14:31.180
Well,then he didn't leave these tracks.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.450
It was definitely a Porsche.

14:33.510 --> 14:35.380
It was either a Boxster or a 911.

14:35.450 --> 14:37.410
I wish I could narrow it down. As a matter of fact,

14:37.480 --> 14:38.980
you can.

14:39.050 --> 14:41.610
Run it against any Florida plate,focus on the number 32.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.110
You got it.

14:46.810 --> 14:48.980
An '07 Porsche 911.

14:49.050 --> 14:50.880
Wow. Barry Ellis.

14:50.950 --> 14:52.880
Big sports agent. Big wallet.

14:52.950 --> 14:54.110
Now he's got a big problem.

14:54.180 --> 14:55.480
Call Dispatch, impound his vehicle,

14:55.550 --> 14:58.010
and bring him in.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.180
A mine buried on Miami Beach?

15:02.250 --> 15:03.580
You gotta be kidding me.

15:03.650 --> 15:07.310
We found plastic shrapnel embedded in your car,Barry.

15:14.050 --> 15:16.950
Ario and Jorge were going to be my clients.

15:17.010 --> 15:18.880
One fireball pitcher, one power hitter.

15:18.950 --> 15:21.910
You were smuggling baseball players. Hey.

15:21.980 --> 15:23.610
I'm not about to let politics stop me

15:23.680 --> 15:26.050
from signing some of the best players in the world.

15:26.110 --> 15:28.050
Did you know Fidel Castro- he tried out

15:28.110 --> 15:29.980
for the Cincinnati Reds back in the '40s?

15:30.050 --> 15:31.680
I did not know that,Barry.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.780
What happened to Ario this morning?

15:33.850 --> 15:35.810
Man,I wish I knew more.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.480
I had contracts waiting for them.

15:37.550 --> 15:39.950
One year in the minors and they'd go straight to the bigs.

15:40.010 --> 15:41.910
All they had to do was get here.

15:41.980 --> 15:45.180
<i>Ario and Jorge were running towards the car.</i>

15:45.250 --> 15:47.150
<i>Then...</i>

15:52.680 --> 15:55.250
<i>Esta muerto, esta muerto! What?</i>

15:55.310 --> 15:57.150
<i>Rapido!</i>

15:57.210 --> 16:01.510
And... Ario,he just... he's gone.

16:01.580 --> 16:03.610
I couldn't believe it.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.210
Where's George? The hitter?

16:05.280 --> 16:07.010
He's at practice. Dobson Field.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.010
So,Ario out...

16:08.080 --> 16:10.380
you still have George.

16:10.450 --> 16:12.780
Hey,hey,hey,I lost millions in that explosion.

16:12.850 --> 16:14.210
This is going to take some time,

16:14.280 --> 16:15.310
believe me.

16:15.380 --> 16:16.880
Yes. I did not kill

16:16.950 --> 16:18.880
that kid, so we're done here,right?

16:18.950 --> 16:22.150
Tell it to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

16:22.210 --> 16:25.050
I have a signing meeting this afternoon.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.850
The only thing that you will be signing,Barry,

16:27.910 --> 16:29.210
is a booking slip.

16:43.070 --> 16:46.500
Hey.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.670
Wow. Bad date?

16:48.740 --> 16:52.300
No,actually,got in the middle of someone else's.

16:52.370 --> 16:54.740
A guy was wailing on his girl, his wife.

16:54.800 --> 16:57.500
And when a girl's in trouble...

16:57.570 --> 16:59.440
Nah,anyone would have done the same thing. No,no.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.940
You're a good guy,Eric. Yeah.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.770
Well,being a good guy doesn't get you much.

17:04.839 --> 17:06.900
I try to help out on the Cuba case

17:06.970 --> 17:09.869
and now I'm stuck,uh, filling out this report.

17:09.940 --> 17:12.140
Excuse me,sir.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.240
Could you help me?

17:15.500 --> 17:18.240
You must have a big sign on your back.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.369
Yeah,I can help you out.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.869
What do you need? I think that I'm lost.

17:23.940 --> 17:25.970
Is this the police station lobby?

17:26.040 --> 17:27.970
No,no,this is the crime lab,

17:28.040 --> 17:29.670
but I can take you over

17:29.740 --> 17:31.040
to the police station lobby if you'd like.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.000
Oh,thank you so much,

17:32.070 --> 17:33.370
Officer...?

17:33.440 --> 17:35.470
Delko. Eric Delko.

17:35.540 --> 17:36.970
You don't have to take me anywhere.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.370
This is for you.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.040
What is this?

17:40.100 --> 17:42.340
You've been served.

17:49.570 --> 17:51.170
I don't know,Eric.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.200
I mean,my dad's the lawyer,not me.

17:53.270 --> 17:54.640
That's fine, but w-what do you think?

17:54.700 --> 17:56.740
It's not good.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.700
Vince Henney filed a civil action against you,

17:58.770 --> 18:00.240
alleging personal injury.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.440
All right,look,I'm gonna talk to our union rep,

18:02.500 --> 18:04.400
see if he can help.

18:04.470 --> 18:06.470
I don't know that that would help since you were off duty.

18:06.540 --> 18:09.470
Well,I can't be out on my own on this.

18:09.540 --> 18:11.840
The guy's suing me for a quarter of a million dollars.

18:17.570 --> 18:18.800
Oh,that's great.

18:18.870 --> 18:19.700
That means you were taking police action.

18:19.770 --> 18:21.000
Yeah,but then I said

18:21.070 --> 18:23.870
to him, "I'm not a cop right now. "

18:23.940 --> 18:24.900
That's bad.

18:24.970 --> 18:27.740
Yeah.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.470
Were there any witnesses?

18:29.540 --> 18:33.340
Yeah,the wife of the guy suing me and the bartender.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.170
Start there.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.470
See if you can get them on your side.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.270
I'm sorry,man.

18:46.340 --> 18:48.270
I don't remember any badge.

18:48.340 --> 18:49.740
Yeah,you're conveniently forgetting

18:49.800 --> 18:51.240
a lot of things today.

18:51.300 --> 18:52.300
Sorry.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.600
Look,man, is Vince threatening you?

18:56.640 --> 18:57.600
The guy's suing me

18:57.670 --> 18:59.870
for $250,000.

18:59.940 --> 19:01.300
How about giving me a little help?

19:01.370 --> 19:04.170
My bar's worth a lot more than that.

19:04.240 --> 19:06.970
I start ratting on customers, they stop coming in.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.900
Unbelievable.

19:10.970 --> 19:12.170
What about the guy's wife?

19:12.240 --> 19:14.040
Yeah,those two are regulars.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.740
If she's not in the bathroom, she's out back on her phone.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.340
What,she's still here?

19:17.400 --> 19:19.300
I didn't want to go home.

19:19.370 --> 19:22.740
My husband's there.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.440
You know he filed a civil suit against me?

19:25.500 --> 19:26.970
I'm not surprised.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.240
He's crazy.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.100
Will you testify to that in court?

19:30.170 --> 19:31.700
Do I have to?

19:31.770 --> 19:33.140
As his wife, you can't be compelled

19:33.200 --> 19:36.070
to testify, but you can choose to.

19:36.140 --> 19:38.670
I don't want you to lie.

19:38.740 --> 19:41.170
I just want you to tell the court what happened.

19:45.070 --> 19:47.540
No,I don't think I can.

19:51.300 --> 19:53.670
I know you think I'm awful,taking your help,

19:53.740 --> 19:55.800
but you don't know him.

19:55.870 --> 19:58.000
I'm sorry,I can't.

19:59.870 --> 20:01.840
You change your mind, you call me,all right?

20:23.200 --> 20:25.500
George Zamareno!

20:25.570 --> 20:27.840
He's at the plate.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.570
Yeah,I don't think he speaks English.

20:29.640 --> 20:30.900
You need a translator?

20:30.970 --> 20:32.000
That won't be necessary.

20:32.070 --> 20:33.070
George.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.670
Hey,if you're gonna talk, at least get out of the box.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.370
I'm legal,okay?

20:45.440 --> 20:47.840
M- My team is taking care of my papers.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.670
I mean,they,they told me political asylum.

20:49.740 --> 20:51.340
Wet foot, dry foot.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.870
George,that's not why I'm here.

20:55.270 --> 20:57.240
He died this morning,but,um...

20:57.300 --> 21:00.070
I think you already knew that.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.900
I did nothing wrong.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.600
Why don't you tell me what happened.

21:09.300 --> 21:11.370
Ario running...

21:11.440 --> 21:12.870
and a blast came out of nowhere.

21:12.940 --> 21:16.900
Who do you think would want to kill you and him?

21:18.940 --> 21:20.600
I don't know.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.500
Who knew you were coming today?

21:22.570 --> 21:23.670
My agent.

21:25.840 --> 21:26.840
Wait a second.

21:26.900 --> 21:28.440
There was a third man on the boat.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.170
Was he a baseball player?

21:30.240 --> 21:32.300
No,no. He was bad.

21:33.940 --> 21:37.070
He just said that the guy's here to do evil?

21:37.140 --> 21:39.870
That's exactly what he said.

21:41.870 --> 21:45.570
He wanted to scare us with this.

21:45.640 --> 21:48.140
.223 round.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.570
That's a rifle round.

21:53.540 --> 21:55.070
I got this,too.

21:55.140 --> 21:57.100
It's a laser boresighter.

21:57.170 --> 21:59.440
You put this in the muzzle to assure accuracy.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.600
Think we got a sniper?

22:01.670 --> 22:03.570
I think we're looking for an assassin.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.700
An assassin from Cuba.

22:05.770 --> 22:07.170
How we gonna stop an assassination

22:07.240 --> 22:09.440
when we don't know who the killer is or his target?

22:09.500 --> 22:11.500
Miami is the center of the anti-Castro movement.

22:11.570 --> 22:13.740
Perfect place for its mark.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.100
We follow the gun.

22:15.170 --> 22:16.170
Thank you,George.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.370
Hey. Hey.

22:26.440 --> 22:27.340
So anything yet on the cartridges

22:27.400 --> 22:28.970
from the assassin's gun?

22:29.040 --> 22:30.970
Well,based on the extractor and ejector marks,

22:31.040 --> 22:33.140
I know that they were fired from an HK SL8.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.100
Oh,well,that's some serious firepower.

22:35.170 --> 22:36.800
Do we know who has one?

22:36.870 --> 22:38.840
Yeah,I'm searching IBIS as we speak.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.500
What about the land mines?

22:40.570 --> 22:42.470
Bomb Squad gave me what they recovered,

22:42.540 --> 22:44.070
but the fragments were so mangled,

22:44.140 --> 22:45.200
there was no discernable signature.

22:45.270 --> 22:46.440
Yeah,well,

22:46.500 --> 22:48.000
between the explosions and the ocean,

22:48.070 --> 22:49.640
I'm not surprised about that.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.270
Oh,there's IBIS.

22:55.570 --> 22:57.700
Wow,our assassin's gun has quite a history.

22:57.770 --> 22:59.540
Three previous crimes.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.070
Okay,well,let's take a look at the latest.

23:05.100 --> 23:08.100
It was last on record for murder in 2001.

23:08.170 --> 23:09.900
It's probably been in Cuba since then.

23:09.970 --> 23:11.770
Did we know who pulled the trigger in the 2001 case?

23:11.840 --> 23:14.070
Yeah,we had a suspect, but we were never

23:14.140 --> 23:15.740
able to put the gun in his hand.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.500
His name is Alejandro Moyano.

23:17.570 --> 23:20.900
It's not the first time he's been a suspect for murder.

23:20.970 --> 23:22.840
He seems like a Cuban hit man.

23:22.900 --> 23:23.870
And he's not in prison?

23:23.940 --> 23:25.400
No.

23:25.470 --> 23:27.000
Horatio's been trying to put him behind bars for a year.

23:27.070 --> 23:28.570
Thinks he's even linked to the congressman's murder.

23:28.640 --> 23:32.540
There seems to be a sharp drop off in his criminal activity.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.800
Word was, his gun was stolen.

23:34.870 --> 23:37.340
He runs a cigar shop down in Calle Ocho now.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.170
Looks like Alejandro just came out of retirement.

23:41.900 --> 23:44.900
So who's your next target,Alejandro?

23:44.970 --> 23:46.570
Lieutenant Caine, if you only knew

23:46.640 --> 23:48.770
how much I've missed these conversations.

23:48.840 --> 23:50.940
You should come to my shop sometimes.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.870
I just received the finest shipment of Cuban cigars.

23:53.940 --> 23:55.600
I'll save you one.

23:55.670 --> 23:57.940
Actually,interested in another shipment you received.

24:01.100 --> 24:03.040
A bullet casing?

24:03.100 --> 24:04.440
Yes,from your gun,

24:04.500 --> 24:07.440
fired off a boat from Cuba last night.

24:07.500 --> 24:10.370
You have anything tying this to me,

24:10.440 --> 24:11.970
or do you just miss me?

24:12.040 --> 24:13.400
I couldn't charge you

24:13.470 --> 24:14.970
because I couldn't find the rifle.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.100
But it is back in Miami now.

24:17.170 --> 24:18.900
Must have made that trip by itself.

24:18.970 --> 24:21.840
Lieutenant Caine,why would I go to Cuba?

24:21.900 --> 24:23.600
I'm living the American dream.

24:23.670 --> 24:26.870
Maybe it was delivered along with your next job assignment.

24:26.940 --> 24:30.340
This business, killing for money,

24:30.400 --> 24:32.400
it's a younger man's game.

24:32.470 --> 24:34.640
But it looks like

24:34.700 --> 24:38.540
that some young man is trying to live up to my legend.

24:38.600 --> 24:41.740
Lieutenant Caine,I'd be wary.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.700
You may have another Alejandro on your hands.

24:46.700 --> 24:48.700
Well,then,I guess...

24:48.770 --> 24:52.470
I guess you better hope I don't find his rifle,Alejandro.

24:55.270 --> 24:57.570
<i>MAN All units report to Dixie Canal.</i>

24:57.640 --> 25:00.170
<i>Suspect boat located.</i>

25:00.240 --> 25:02.100
Officers.

25:02.170 --> 25:03.770
The guy who rented this slip called us.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.240
This boat showed up; it's not his.

25:05.300 --> 25:07.870
This is part of the land mine.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.100
It's scorched.

25:11.140 --> 25:12.500
Yeah,this is definitely the boat

25:12.570 --> 25:15.470
that the ballplayers and the assassin came in on.

25:21.970 --> 25:25.100
Okay,well,no refugee that made it onto dry land

25:25.170 --> 25:26.770
would ever go near the water again.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.770
Probably didn't even get off at Haulover.

25:28.840 --> 25:31.000
Probably came here to be among these rich houses here.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.440
Officer down! I repeat,officer down!

25:50.500 --> 25:51.570
Status!

25:51.640 --> 25:53.700
Vest caught the round.

25:53.770 --> 25:55.640
Took one in the arm,sir.

25:57.670 --> 25:59.270
Shooter's gone.

25:59.340 --> 26:02.670
He's gone.

26:02.740 --> 26:05.040
Mr. Wolfe,

26:16.560 --> 26:19.400
Well,the place was empty, except for these casings.

26:19.460 --> 26:21.600
They look like the ones the ballplayer gave us.

26:21.660 --> 26:22.760
And this "For Sale" sign

26:22.830 --> 26:24.430
explains why he chose this location.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.630
Yeah,shooter waited in here for the time to be right.

26:27.700 --> 26:30.460
Nice mansion by the water.

26:30.530 --> 26:31.860
I'll start printing.

26:31.930 --> 26:33.230
Mr. Wolfe,

26:33.300 --> 26:34.660
he's not gonna be in the system.

26:36.300 --> 26:37.800
Hello.

26:37.860 --> 26:38.900
Officer Delko?

26:38.960 --> 26:40.500
Yeah,who's this?

26:40.560 --> 26:41.830
This is Carmen Henney.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.330
What do you want?

26:43.400 --> 26:44.960
It's my husband Vince.

26:45.030 --> 26:47.830
Look,Mrs. Henney,I don't know if you have a case of amnesia,

26:47.900 --> 26:49.600
but your husband is suing me.

26:49.660 --> 26:51.260
I know,but something bad has happened.

26:51.330 --> 26:54.160
Well,look,if it's an emergency why don't you call 911?

26:54.230 --> 26:55.830
It's too late for that.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.260
What do you mean it's too late?

26:57.330 --> 26:58.660
Vince is dead!

26:58.730 --> 27:00.160
Where are you?

27:00.230 --> 27:02.400
The alley behind Garden Vista.

27:02.460 --> 27:04.930
All right,give me five minutes, I'll be there.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.360
Thank you for coming so quickly.

27:17.430 --> 27:19.630
Look,just save your story,all right?

27:19.700 --> 27:22.100
Detective Tripp will be handling the investigation.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.430
Mrs. Henney.

27:23.500 --> 27:26.060
Were you here at the time of your husband's death?

27:26.130 --> 27:27.400
No.

27:27.460 --> 27:29.000
Just found him like this.

27:29.060 --> 27:31.130
Anyone want Vince dead?

27:31.200 --> 27:33.800
Not that I could think of.

27:33.860 --> 27:35.430
Didn't you tell your husband you'd kill him

27:35.500 --> 27:36.900
the next time he touched you?

27:36.960 --> 27:38.360
Kind of.

27:38.430 --> 27:39.730
I mean,I was upset.

27:41.430 --> 27:43.430
Look,if you're thinking it was me,you're way off.

27:43.500 --> 27:44.500
I didn't kill Vince.

27:44.560 --> 27:47.360
I'll be the judge of that.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.400
Blood on the pipe.

27:54.460 --> 27:56.430
Could be our murder weapon.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.830
Well,I'm no CSI,Delko,but...

27:58.900 --> 28:00.830
why's there no blood on our victim?

28:00.900 --> 28:03.230
Good eye,Tripp.

28:03.300 --> 28:04.830
Blood could belong to our killer.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.260
In that case,Miss Henney,

28:06.330 --> 28:09.230
we're gonna need a DNA sample.

28:11.230 --> 28:14.560
What are you doing with my bomb evidence?

28:14.630 --> 28:16.060
Some debris from the explosion

28:16.130 --> 28:18.400
blasted into the assassin's boat.

28:18.460 --> 28:20.600
I think I found the missing piece to your bomb.

28:20.660 --> 28:21.830
What do you mean "missing piece"?

28:21.900 --> 28:23.400
Well,land mines are self-contained.

28:23.460 --> 28:25.300
They're plastic-coated, and when you step on one,

28:25.360 --> 28:26.900
you activate a pressure switch.

28:31.430 --> 28:33.530
So why didn't the land mine detonate

28:33.600 --> 28:36.130
when the bomber put it in the sand?

28:36.200 --> 28:38.360
Because of the safety pin.

28:38.430 --> 28:41.600
It's the last thing the bomber pulls once the mine is in place.

28:52.830 --> 28:56.460
And he left a little something on it when he touched it.

28:56.530 --> 28:59.230
The peaks indicate mineral oil.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.600
Turpentine and rosin.

29:01.660 --> 29:03.600
Why would you mix those together?

29:03.660 --> 29:05.230
You put the gunk in your throwing hand,

29:05.300 --> 29:08.330
it helps grip the ball better and makes the ball move more.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.430
Pitcher.

29:22.500 --> 29:25.130
Also makes Lou Pennington a suspect.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.630
He's at the plate.

29:26.700 --> 29:28.160
I don't think he speaks English.

29:28.230 --> 29:29.500
You need a translator?

29:29.560 --> 29:32.560
So,Mr. Pennington,

29:32.630 --> 29:34.660
last season,you got a ten-game suspension

29:34.730 --> 29:37.960
for using foreign substances to improve your grip-

29:38.030 --> 29:40.530
rosin,turpentine,mineral oil.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.560
I'm playing again now.

29:42.630 --> 29:43.730
It was no big deal.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.930
Blowing someone up is a big deal.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.800
We found some of your special mixture

29:48.860 --> 29:51.130
on a component of the land mine that killed

29:51.200 --> 29:54.300
Ario Pastano.

29:56.330 --> 29:57.930
I never even met the guy.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.930
Let me refresh your memory.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.600
He's a right-handed pitcher, just like you,

30:02.660 --> 30:04.360
except he's about seven years younger,

30:04.430 --> 30:08.400
0.88 ERA,96-mile- an-hour fastball.

30:12.400 --> 30:15.130
My agent came for a visit,

30:15.200 --> 30:17.660
and then he takes a phone call.

30:17.730 --> 30:21.430
<i>He just assumes I can't habla.</i>

30:24.230 --> 30:26.400
<i>Dieciocho anos.</i>

30:26.460 --> 30:30.000
<i>Fantastico. Estan un poco inestables en esaposicion.</i>

30:30.060 --> 30:32.330
<i>Bien.</i>

30:32.400 --> 30:34.130
<i>Mismo arreglo que antes.</i>

30:34.200 --> 30:35.700
<i>Laentra de en Playa Haulover.</i>

30:35.760 --> 30:38.160
<i>Cuatrode la manana,el Sabado.</i>

30:40.160 --> 30:41.360
What's that about?

30:41.430 --> 30:42.960
Nothing.

30:43.030 --> 30:44.960
Listen,you don't get your ERA under three this season,

30:45.030 --> 30:46.000
you're gonna drop to double-A.

30:46.060 --> 30:48.000
And,you know,Lou,

30:48.060 --> 30:50.300
I only represent guys on their way up.

30:53.460 --> 30:57.230
I've been waiting three years for my chance at the show.

30:57.300 --> 30:59.530
Now my agent's bringing in a new guy

30:59.600 --> 31:01.200
and threatening to drop me?

31:01.260 --> 31:02.800
So you decided to get rid of the competition

31:02.860 --> 31:04.860
by using a black market land mine?

31:10.530 --> 31:14.200
I read an article about some old mines

31:14.260 --> 31:17.000
buried on Miami beaches during the missile crisis.

31:17.060 --> 31:18.430
Except,those mines,

31:18.500 --> 31:20.030
they're an urban legend.

31:20.100 --> 31:21.530
Yours was real.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.830
It's not enough that I have to compete

31:23.900 --> 31:25.600
with all the American talent,

31:25.660 --> 31:28.730
my own agent smuggles in a Cuban as my competition.

31:28.800 --> 31:32.030
Competition should be good for the sport.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.130
I couldn't let that guy come in

31:35.200 --> 31:37.930
and ruin my baseball career.

31:44.100 --> 31:46.400
Well,it looks like he didn't have to.

31:46.460 --> 31:49.000
You did it yourself.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.930
Looks like things are going your way today.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.960
Blood on your husband's murder weapon was not yours.

31:59.030 --> 32:00.930
That means I'm innocent.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.460
That means it wasn't your blood.

32:02.530 --> 32:04.200
Well,can I go?

32:04.260 --> 32:05.860
Yeah,I'll have a uniform take you out to the car.

32:05.930 --> 32:07.230
But I want to say something first.

32:07.300 --> 32:10.560
I am sorry for your loss,Mrs. Henney.

32:10.630 --> 32:13.400
I'm not sorry to see Vince's civil suit go away.

32:13.460 --> 32:16.130
What makes you think it will go?

32:16.200 --> 32:20.160
Plaintiff dies, case is dismissed.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.800
Officer Delko's pretty much off the hook.

32:23.830 --> 32:26.660
Actually,it's a little more complicated than that.

32:26.730 --> 32:29.800
How do you mean?

32:29.860 --> 32:31.230
According to Florida law,

32:31.300 --> 32:32.960
Vince's claim can survive his death.

32:33.030 --> 32:34.960
As beneficiary of his estate,

32:35.030 --> 32:36.930
I recover the value of lost support and services.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.330
In Officer Delko's case,

32:39.400 --> 32:41.500
it means the quarter mil goes to me.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.830
This isn't happeni.

32:43.900 --> 32:45.500
Really?

32:45.560 --> 32:46.830
Hey.

32:46.900 --> 32:48.600
You have no right to do this.

32:48.660 --> 32:50.030
I defended you.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.530
That's an admission of fact, by the way.

32:51.600 --> 32:54.300
Look,you need money, get a job like everyone else.

32:54.360 --> 32:55.800
You're about to spend an awful long time

32:55.860 --> 32:57.500
in court,do you really want to string this out?

32:57.560 --> 32:58.700
What do you think,I'm gonna

32:58.760 --> 32:59.930
lay down without a fight?!

33:00.000 --> 33:01.800
Huh? Are you crazy?

33:01.860 --> 33:03.430
I'm crazy?

33:03.500 --> 33:05.530
For all I know,you killed Vince to save yourself some cash.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.000
If I find out anything like that,

33:08.060 --> 33:09.360
I'll have the complaint amended

33:09.430 --> 33:12.230
to include a count of wrongful death.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.060
Get her out of here.

33:16.130 --> 33:18.730
And,gentlemen,

33:18.800 --> 33:20.860
have a nice day.

33:25.100 --> 33:27.030
That bloodsucker and her husband

33:27.100 --> 33:29.160
had me set up from the beginning.

33:29.230 --> 33:31.730
She's a snake,Eric.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.100
You were at the wrong place at the wrong time.

33:53.280 --> 33:55.610
Is that the pipe that killed Vince Henney?

33:55.680 --> 33:57.340
It is. I just processed it.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.480
I didn't get any hit on the blood,

33:59.540 --> 34:00.980
and the prints were unusable.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.810
His wife's threatening me with wrongful death.

34:02.880 --> 34:05.210
I'll be damned if she's going to get away with murder

34:05.280 --> 34:06.780
and I pay for it.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.880
You really think she did it? Could very well be.

34:08.940 --> 34:10.139
Carmen Henney's an expert in deception.

34:10.210 --> 34:11.510
What do you mean?

34:11.580 --> 34:13.340
She's a slip-and-fall artist from Tampa.

34:13.409 --> 34:15.639
She won half a dozen personal injury suits

34:15.710 --> 34:17.239
under her maiden name.

34:18.780 --> 34:21.540
I wish I had something for you. I...

34:21.610 --> 34:25.739
I mean,there was something weird about the prints.

34:25.810 --> 34:28.409
There was a pattern, but there was no ridge detail.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.940
Take a look.

34:35.780 --> 34:37.639
Someone has paronychia.

34:37.710 --> 34:41.510
Eww. That sounds... contagious.

34:41.580 --> 34:46.010
<i>It's an affliction that plagues bartenders.</i>

34:46.080 --> 34:48.010
Okay,you repackage it.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.710
No,I can't touch it. Remember?

34:50.780 --> 34:51.880
Thank you.

34:51.940 --> 34:54.340
<i>Thank you.</i>

34:57.440 --> 35:00.880
I bet you use real limes in your mojitos,am I right?

35:00.940 --> 35:02.780
Are you asking the questions,now?

35:02.840 --> 35:04.410
I thought you were in trouble.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.980
No,you're the one who's in trouble,so shut up

35:07.040 --> 35:09.780
and hold out your hand.

35:13.110 --> 35:16.810
Yeah,you have paronychia- aka bar rot.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.310
Excuse me?

35:18.380 --> 35:20.410
The citric acid in the lemons and limes-

35:20.480 --> 35:22.740
it kills your skin and cuticles.

35:24.910 --> 35:29.110
* *

35:29.180 --> 35:33.880
<i>Couple that with the bacteria in dirty dishwater...</i>

35:33.940 --> 35:37.040
<i>and you have bar rot.</i>

35:39.580 --> 35:43.280
Unfortunately for you, disease patterns can be matched.

35:43.340 --> 35:46.180
We matched the ones on that autopsy photo that you touched

35:46.240 --> 35:48.410
to Vince's murder weapon.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.710
Why did you kill Vince?

35:53.110 --> 35:55.580
I knew what he and his wife were doing.

35:55.640 --> 35:58.010
Their big scam.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.780
I told him I wanted in on it.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.940
You get a rich guy to hit you,

36:02.010 --> 36:04.940
then you sue for personal injury.

36:05.010 --> 36:06.680
That's the scam,right?

36:06.740 --> 36:08.280
What if it was?

36:08.340 --> 36:10.510
It's my bar... I want my share.

36:10.580 --> 36:12.640
That's not gonna happen.

36:12.710 --> 36:14.040
I can always tell the cops.

36:14.110 --> 36:16.180
You do,I'll tell them you're in on it.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.010
Look,there's a reason you're still a bartender.

36:18.080 --> 36:20.580
Stick with the tips,loser.

36:31.880 --> 36:34.240
Who the hell does he think he is,hmm?

36:34.310 --> 36:36.640
Telling me I'm not good enough for his small-time con.

36:36.710 --> 36:39.410
So you showed him you were good enough to kill him.

36:44.380 --> 36:46.710
How do I make some kind of deal here?

36:46.780 --> 36:50.240
Start by telling me the truth about your bar.

36:53.010 --> 36:54.640
Your officer was right.

36:54.710 --> 36:57.210
A lot of F.O.B. Cubans come in there for papers.

36:57.280 --> 36:59.140
One come in this morning?

36:59.210 --> 37:01.180
Yeah. Name's Guillermo.

37:01.240 --> 37:03.680
Tall guy with some kind of case.

37:03.740 --> 37:05.180
Like a gun case?

37:05.240 --> 37:06.610
Could've been.

37:06.680 --> 37:09.240
Did he say where he was going, mention any names?

37:10.710 --> 37:13.810
I heard him talking about some guy...

37:13.880 --> 37:15.710
Miguel Santora.

37:15.780 --> 37:17.410
Mr. Wolfe,

37:17.480 --> 37:19.210
Miguel Santora-

37:19.280 --> 37:20.780
everything.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.380
So the bartender heard right.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.210
It turns out Miguel Santora is

37:29.280 --> 37:31.110
part of the anti-Castro movement.

37:31.180 --> 37:32.610
He actually provides

37:32.680 --> 37:34.940
a significant amount of their financial backing.

37:35.010 --> 37:38.580
So killing him could be a setback to the movement.

37:38.640 --> 37:40.440
That makes him a perfect target.

37:40.510 --> 37:43.040
Yes. Where is he? I tried calling him on his cell phone,

37:43.110 --> 37:44.580
but it went straight to voice mail.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.540
His assistant said that he is on the job.

37:46.610 --> 37:47.710
A job?

37:47.780 --> 37:49.280
Yeah,he's a builder-investor.

37:49.340 --> 37:51.580
He's got five corporate properties right now in Miami,

37:51.640 --> 37:53.710
so there's really no telling which one he's at.

37:53.780 --> 37:56.480
Okay,so we pull the plans from the job sites.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.510
Maybe there's a reason he's not calling back.

38:08.610 --> 38:10.980
I have that info you wanted.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.410
What are you doing?

38:14.480 --> 38:16.210
Public Works sent me some satellite photos,

38:16.280 --> 38:17.880
including the five sites

38:17.940 --> 38:19.610
that Miguel Santora has under construction.

38:19.680 --> 38:22.640
So,I'm,uh,scanning them into the imaging software.

38:22.710 --> 38:24.980
And the image is...

38:28.340 --> 38:31.140
All of his buildings are downtown.

38:31.210 --> 38:33.840
How'd he get all those prime locations?

38:33.910 --> 38:35.680
He must know something we don't.

38:35.740 --> 38:38.680
We know something that he definitely doesn't,so...

38:38.740 --> 38:40.780
We're running out of time.

38:43.610 --> 38:44.980
His buildings are the ones in red.

38:45.040 --> 38:48.280
<i>And now is when your information helps.</i>

38:48.340 --> 38:52.010
Oh. Well,Santora's cell phone provider is TeleShore.

38:52.080 --> 38:56.210
Okay,let's look for all the antennas and shared towers.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.380
Okay,so he's got really great cell coverage.

38:58.440 --> 38:59.780
So what?

38:59.840 --> 39:01.580
No,no. He doesn't have good coverage today.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.010
His cell phone is unreachable.

39:03.080 --> 39:05.940
You think one of his buildings is in a dead zone?

39:06.010 --> 39:08.210
Exactly. What causes loss of reception?

39:08.280 --> 39:09.640
Air traffic control-

39:09.710 --> 39:11.340
that disturbs all kinds of radio waves.

39:11.410 --> 39:12.910
No,none of the buildings are close enough

39:12.980 --> 39:14.440
to an airport for that.

39:14.510 --> 39:16.880
A tall building between a phone and a cell tower.

39:16.940 --> 39:19.180
Okay,I'll factor that in.

39:22.240 --> 39:23.310
No.

39:23.380 --> 39:24.640
Movies?

39:24.710 --> 39:26.540
What? AMV theaters just installed

39:26.610 --> 39:29.340
cell jammers in all their theaters

39:29.410 --> 39:32.380
so people can't talk during the show.

39:37.310 --> 39:38.880
That's it.

39:38.940 --> 39:41.810
Santora's building is right in the middle of a dead zone.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.210
Yeah,in more ways than one.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.610
The building next to it is

39:44.680 --> 39:46.210
a perfect vantage point for a sniper.

39:46.280 --> 39:48.540
H... I found the assassin.

39:53.140 --> 39:55.280
* *

40:06.840 --> 40:09.380
* *

40:25.340 --> 40:27.240
It's all over,Guillermo.

40:27.310 --> 40:30.210
Not in Cuba,senor.

40:31.980 --> 40:33.380
Take your finger off that trigger.

40:35.010 --> 40:38.380
I made a promise to Fidel; I cannot stop now.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.710
Yes,you can,Guillermo. This is your chance.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.610
What's it gonna be?

40:45.680 --> 40:48.240
We both have our laws.

40:48.310 --> 40:50.080
There's only one law,Guillermo.

41:00.310 --> 41:02.410
Get down...

41:18.910 --> 41:21.340
I don't know how to thank you,Lieutenant.

41:21.410 --> 41:23.940
Just keep up the good work,Miguel.

41:24.010 --> 41:26.780
You,too.

41:26.840 --> 41:30.880
We both tried to make Miami a better place.

41:30.940 --> 41:32.640
And we are.

41:32.710 --> 41:35.610
I'm also preparing my people for a day

41:35.680 --> 41:37.780
when they can do the same for Cuba.

41:37.840 --> 41:40.940
And that day is going to come,Miguel.

41:41.010 --> 41:43.280
But you see how high passions run

41:43.340 --> 41:45.480
when it comes to Cuba's future.

41:45.540 --> 41:48.440
So we've got to make sure of one thing,don't we?

41:48.510 --> 41:50.040
What's that?

41:50.110 --> 41:52.510
That you're still around to see it.

41:55.810 --> 41:58.540
Take care,Miguel.

42:07.880 --> 42:09.640
Are you signing out?

42:09.710 --> 42:12.510
I won't be signing out for a while.

42:12.580 --> 42:15.640
Are you having your wages garnished?

42:15.710 --> 42:19.180
Yeah,20% of every check now goes straight to the court.

42:19.240 --> 42:20.940
To pay off the con artist?

42:21.010 --> 42:22.780
She wins.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.610
Eric,let me ask you something:

42:24.680 --> 42:26.880
Why did you decide to settle instead of going to court?

42:26.940 --> 42:28.240
Because I don't want anyone looking

42:28.310 --> 42:29.510
into this lab anymore than they have to.

42:29.580 --> 42:31.010
But you didn't do anything wrong.

42:31.080 --> 42:32.510
Not in this country.

42:32.580 --> 42:33.710
But Horatio and I going to Brazil-

42:33.780 --> 42:35.040
that wasn't exactly sanctioned.

42:35.110 --> 42:36.810
I have to make this go away;

42:36.880 --> 42:39.140
it's going to take money to do that.

42:39.210 --> 42:41.910
Is there anything that I can do?

42:41.980 --> 42:45.210
Yeah,I'm going to have to start pulling some extra shifts,so...

42:45.280 --> 42:48.580
All right,I got your back; don't worry.

42:49.980 --> 42:51.380
It's hard not to...

42:51.440 --> 42:52.980
but thanks.
