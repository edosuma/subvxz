00:24.111 --> 00:26.330

that's got to be ready by now.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.978
I was a finalist on Top Chef,
okay? Shit's like pork.

14:09.022 --> 14:11.067
If you don't cook it
long enough, you'll get sick.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.939
You're worried
about getting sick?

14:12.982 --> 14:14.854
Fucking look at us.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.595
Looks overdone to me.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.119
Easy.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.685
Who the fuck are you?

14:20.729 --> 14:22.383
Look, I'm just trying to find
my girlfriend.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.951
We got separated back in L.A.
when everything went to hell.

14:24.994 --> 14:27.344
I've been on her trail
for about a year now.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.172
I heard a lot of rumors
about this place,

14:29.216 --> 14:32.045
some kind of special shelter
for rich people.

14:32.088 --> 14:33.394
Supposed to be in this area.

14:33.437 --> 14:35.091
You guys know anything
about that?

14:36.223 --> 14:37.050
If there was a shelter,

14:37.093 --> 14:38.834
we would have raided it
ourselves.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.619
You must've got
some bad information.

14:41.663 --> 14:45.058
Take a load off.
Try the chow.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.277
Don't think I like
what's on the menu.

14:47.321 --> 14:49.279
Ah, it's not as bad as it looks.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.107
Grows on you.

14:51.151 --> 14:54.154
Got a lot growing
on me already, thanks.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.945
-Where's the shelter?!
-I don't know.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.033
Please!

15:04.077 --> 15:05.774
I-I wasn't always like this.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.645
I used to be
a special-ed teacher.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.696
[horses neighing, galloping]

15:36.239 --> 15:37.937
[alarm blaring]

15:39.503 --> 15:42.985
Perimeter alarm.
Something's breached the gates.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.509
Could this be an attack?
Like those other Outposts?

15:51.515 --> 15:53.517
[galloping continues]

16:08.532 --> 16:11.274
MEAD:
Get out of the carriage!

16:11.318 --> 16:13.015
Show yourself.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.279
Now!

16:44.177 --> 16:47.049
The hell is going on?

17:03.370 --> 17:05.024
It's clean.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.031
[Mead gasps]

17:14.163 --> 17:15.164
Apples.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.123
Why would The Cooperative

17:17.166 --> 17:19.212
send a carriage with apples?

17:19.255 --> 17:21.083
-Not a blemish.
-If they're prewar,

17:21.127 --> 17:23.085
how would they
have been preserved?

17:23.129 --> 17:25.218
It's really not that hard
to imagine.

17:25.261 --> 17:27.916
Modern apples
have a shelf life of months

17:27.959 --> 17:30.223
because of all the chemicals
they inject into them

17:30.266 --> 17:33.095
at special atmospheric
packing facilities.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.272
I ran a nutrition blog
before the war.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.057
It was really catching on,
I think.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.713
Maybe they were grown
in The Sanctuary.

17:42.757 --> 17:45.368
Langdon must have had them
delivered to show everyone

17:45.412 --> 17:48.197
what will be waiting
for the chosen.

17:52.723 --> 17:54.812
Not sure that's a...

17:59.295 --> 18:01.384
Exquisite.

18:02.559 --> 18:06.215
I'd swear it was tree-ripened.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.738
Looks like a Red Delicious.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.436
Probably grown
on the East Coast.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.700
They're not from the East Coast.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.267
They're a gift from the gods.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.138
They're divine providence.

18:16.182 --> 18:19.228
The answer to our prayer.

18:23.319 --> 18:26.235
Perhaps you should take care
of the horses

18:26.279 --> 18:28.281
before they die on the lawn.

18:33.677 --> 18:36.637
[door opens, closes]

18:36.680 --> 18:39.161
There's not a bad apple
in the bunch.

18:40.423 --> 18:43.296
What if they were all bad?

18:43.339 --> 18:45.254
What do you mean?

18:45.298 --> 18:46.212
Poisoned.

18:47.474 --> 18:48.779
Might take a little work
to extract it,

18:48.823 --> 18:50.346
but we've got plenty.

18:50.390 --> 18:54.655
And we won't have to convince
any of them to devour these.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.178
But we need to make sure

18:56.222 --> 18:58.224
they all eat them
at the same time.

19:00.269 --> 19:02.489
A party, perhaps.

19:26.382 --> 19:27.470
[gurgling]

19:56.195 --> 19:58.197
[elevator beeps]

20:06.466 --> 20:09.469
MALLORY:
I don't know who I am.

20:13.342 --> 20:15.736
LANGDON:
I can see into the dark places

20:15.779 --> 20:18.347
that people desperately try
to keep hidden.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.523
MALLORY:
I don't have any dark places.

20:20.567 --> 20:21.872
LANGDON:
Really?

20:23.483 --> 20:25.441
You're afraid.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.791
Of accepting who you are.

20:29.402 --> 20:30.881
MALLORY:
Sometimes I feel

20:30.925 --> 20:33.188
like there's someone buried
inside me.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.278
Someone trying
to claw their way out.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.498
LANGDON:
Who?

20:38.541 --> 20:39.803
[echoing screaming]

20:41.370 --> 20:44.286
WOMAN:
Mallory.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.376
Come on, Venable called
an emergency meeting.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.251
These past several months have
been difficult for all of us.

20:53.730 --> 20:57.299
And perhaps, in my efforts
to keep us safe,

20:57.343 --> 20:59.736
punitive measures
have been taken too far.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.437
I believe now what we need
is a moment of celebration,

21:04.480 --> 21:06.308
camaraderie.

21:06.352 --> 21:10.573
Which is why this weekend,
as a gesture of goodwill,

21:10.617 --> 21:12.314
we will have
a Halloween soiree...

21:12.358 --> 21:14.185
-Ah.
-Ah.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.971
...in the style of
a Victorian masquerade ball.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.367
It's Halloween this weekend?

21:21.410 --> 21:23.891
[clears throat]
If only my nana were here

21:23.934 --> 21:25.762
to enjoy it with me.

21:25.806 --> 21:28.330
VENABLE: We've all
lost track of time a bit.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.376
And this festive occasion

21:30.419 --> 21:32.900
is the perfect opportunity
to remedy this.

21:32.943 --> 21:36.599
And I encourage you all
to use your imaginations,

21:36.643 --> 21:41.343
to create what I am sure
will be exquisite costumes.

21:41.387 --> 21:44.390
Attendance is mandatory.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.614
Mallory...

21:51.658 --> 21:54.356
why are you molesting my Loubs?

21:54.400 --> 21:57.446
I was just thinking maybe I
could use the spikes for a mask.

21:57.490 --> 21:58.621
You've always hated this pair,
you haven't touched them

21:58.665 --> 22:00.231
-for years.
-Well, have you ever heard

22:00.275 --> 22:02.146
of something having
sentimental value?

22:02.190 --> 22:04.192
Besides, I don't think the, uh,

22:04.235 --> 22:06.499
fancy dressing up stuff
is really for you Grays.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.196
-[Mr. Gallant laughs]
-Oh, my God,

22:08.239 --> 22:10.285
do you remember that Halloween
where you dressed up

22:10.329 --> 22:13.027
as young Michael Jackson
from The Jackson 5,

22:13.070 --> 22:15.290
and then I dressed
as Michael Jackson on trial

22:15.334 --> 22:16.770
for touching little boys?

22:16.813 --> 22:18.772
-Yes! It was the best.
-[Mr. Gallant squealing]

22:18.815 --> 22:21.252
I fucking love Halloween.
It's the one day of the year

22:21.296 --> 22:23.167
when the rest of the world
puts in some effort

22:23.211 --> 22:25.474
to be fabulous,
like I am every other day.

22:25.518 --> 22:28.434
I don't know why Venable has
such a hard-on for Halloween.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.392
It's not like we've celebrated
any other holidays

22:30.436 --> 22:32.046
since we checked into
this hellhole.

22:32.089 --> 22:35.441
The closest thing we had
to a Christmas feast was Stu.

22:35.484 --> 22:37.660
-Yeah.
-Wait.

22:37.704 --> 22:41.621
What if Halloween is an excuse?
[gasps]

22:41.664 --> 22:43.449
Oh, my God.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.233
They're using the party

22:45.276 --> 22:48.410
to announce who's going
to The Sanctuary.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.238
Okay, we have to rethink
this whole look.

22:50.281 --> 22:51.848
-I just, I think it's too much.
-What?

22:51.892 --> 22:54.416
I don't want to rub it in for
the ones that don't get picked.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.418
No offense, Mallory.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.115
I didn't think
I was going anyways.

22:58.159 --> 23:02.381
I think that the people who
are gonna go already know.

23:03.599 --> 23:06.341
Wait. What do you mean?
Did Langdon tell you you're in?

23:06.385 --> 23:08.038
[sighs]
Well, let's just say

23:08.082 --> 23:10.476
our one-on-one was very
illuminating.

23:10.519 --> 23:12.347
Wait.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.349
Did something weird happen
to you, too?

23:14.393 --> 23:17.526
What are you babbling about?
What did he say to you?

23:17.570 --> 23:19.485
It wasn't anything he said.

23:19.528 --> 23:24.011
It was... uh... a feeling.

23:24.054 --> 23:26.274
[screaming]

23:28.537 --> 23:30.060
I think I set the room on fire.

23:30.104 --> 23:33.063
What? Like you knocked over
a candle or something?

23:33.107 --> 23:37.067
No. Like flames shot out of the
fireplace and went everywhere.

23:37.111 --> 23:39.113
I know this is impossible,

23:39.156 --> 23:41.463
but I think I made the fire
with my mind.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.247
[scoffs]

23:43.291 --> 23:45.249
Yeah, we're definitely not
talking about the same thing.

23:45.293 --> 23:47.382
Maybe it was the blast,
the radiation,

23:47.426 --> 23:50.472
it did something and now
I'm like the Dark Phoenix.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.953
What are you saying? Are you
saying you have superpowers now?

23:52.996 --> 23:55.390
I don't know.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.739
Never mind.

23:56.783 --> 23:59.350
Oh, well, hey, Mallory,

23:59.394 --> 24:02.702
uh, there's a fire right there,
bitch, do it again.

24:02.745 --> 24:05.095
Come on. Prove it.

24:05.139 --> 24:08.403
Make flames shoot out
everywhere.

24:20.589 --> 24:23.723
[clicks tongue]
Oh. This is pretty lame,

24:23.766 --> 24:25.551
even for you, Mallory.

24:25.594 --> 24:28.641
Some people just have nothing
special about them,

24:28.684 --> 24:30.730
and you have to be okay
with that.

24:30.773 --> 24:32.514
Maybe you can see
if you have a superpower

24:32.558 --> 24:35.952
that allows you to shut your
piehole and get back to work.

24:35.996 --> 24:38.651
My costume isn't going
to make itself.

24:38.694 --> 24:40.653
And why are you even touching
my stuff?

24:40.696 --> 24:42.524
Evie's room is full of crap
that you can use,

24:42.568 --> 24:45.353
not that she'll be needing
any of it anymore.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.137
Maybe I can see if
I've got a superpower

24:47.181 --> 24:49.139
to make you disappear.

24:54.057 --> 24:55.624
-She's out of her mind.

Nobody's even seen a piece
of fresh fruit

25:25.524 --> 25:27.395
in over 18 months.
Where did this come from?

25:27.438 --> 25:29.179
Perhaps I should drag in
one of the horses

25:29.223 --> 25:31.660
who rode through hell to gift us
these sweet little wonders

25:31.704 --> 25:33.227
so you can look it in the mouth.

25:33.270 --> 25:35.838
MR. GALLANT:
I know. It's symbolic.

25:35.882 --> 25:38.014
It's the Garden of Eden,
apples from paradise.

25:38.058 --> 25:39.625
It's obviously from
The Sanctuary.

25:39.668 --> 25:43.193
We should say grace to thank the
universe for sending them to us.

25:43.237 --> 25:46.370
-You are so fucking annoying.
-MEAD: Enough.

25:46.414 --> 25:48.242
Ms. Venable said everyone
will get a chance

25:48.285 --> 25:50.070
to bob for apples later.

[Mallory clears throat]

26:26.280 --> 26:30.893

of the dark half of the year,

26:30.937 --> 26:34.505
when the boundary between
this world and the Other thins,

26:34.549 --> 26:38.031
and lost souls pierce
the firmament,

26:38.074 --> 26:39.772
desperate to find
their way home.

26:39.815 --> 26:43.253
It is a night
to remember the dead,

26:43.297 --> 26:46.387
and there have been
far too many to mourn.

26:48.128 --> 26:52.828
But also to celebrate that we
have yet to join them.

26:54.308 --> 26:56.702
