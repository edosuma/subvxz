00:57.767 --> 01:00.066
Morning, ma. What are you eating?

01:00.133 --> 01:04.567
-Linguini with clam sauce.
-Who eats that for breakfast?

01:04.633 --> 01:07.800
Mother Teresa. It's a recipe from
her new workout book.

01:09.767 --> 01:14.900
-Morning, girls. What are you eating?
-Linguini with clam sauce.

01:14.967 --> 01:17.433
-For breakfast?
-Morning, everybody.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.100
What's that you're eating, Sophia?

01:19.767 --> 01:23.100
364 days a year,
I could be gagging on a peach,

01:23.166 --> 01:24.500
but nobody would notice.

01:25.633 --> 01:29.934
Ma, you don't usually eat pasta
for breakfast.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.600
I'm carbohydrate loading.
I signed up for the charity walkathon.

01:34.734 --> 01:36.667
Ma, are you nuts?

01:36.734 --> 01:40.200
This is for people who walk a lot.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.633
So what do I do, hover?

01:44.900 --> 01:48.600
I've been walking since 1904. Besides,
they have a category for people over 80.

01:48.667 --> 01:50.834
It's a terrific idea.

01:50.900 --> 01:53.100
-Maybe we should join.
-We already did.

01:53.367 --> 01:55.767
-What?
-I said we already did.

01:55.834 --> 02:00.734
I work all week. I don't want to walk
10 miles on a Saturday.

02:00.800 --> 02:03.033
We won't walk. We'll sit.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.333
Fine. I like to sit.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.633
We know. It's your
second favorite position.

02:10.100 --> 02:13.266
I don't mean "sitting" sitting.
I mean babysitting...

02:13.734 --> 02:16.700
right here for the participants'
children on race day.

02:16.767 --> 02:20.600
I don't like other people's children
in my house.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.967
I didn't like my own children in my house.

02:23.033 --> 02:24.734
What else can we do?

02:24.800 --> 02:27.467
The children are
dropped off in the morning

02:27.533 --> 02:31.934
-and picked up by 4:00 in the afternoon.
-Here's something. How about sponging?

02:32.000 --> 02:35.333
-What's that?
-"Spongers cool off the walkers

02:35.400 --> 02:39.400
by sponging down their hot bodies
as they pump their way through Miami."

02:40.467 --> 02:42.467
Doesn't make much sense, does it?

02:42.533 --> 02:45.100
Get them hot and then cool them down.

02:45.567 --> 02:48.033
I swear, sometimes you can read my mind.

02:50.367 --> 02:53.367
-We should stick to babysitting.
-I agree.

02:53.433 --> 02:57.100
-As long as it's only for one day.
-This will be great!

02:57.166 --> 02:58.767
I love charities.

02:59.133 --> 03:02.233
In fact, I helped establish
the Henry Fjord foundation.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.600
The Fjord foundation?

03:05.066 --> 03:08.266
That's the man
who built the Fjord Fjalcon.

03:11.867 --> 03:13.934
Henry Fjord was a saint.

03:14.266 --> 03:18.166
He dedicated his life to eliminating
pond scum from lake St. Olaf.

03:19.834 --> 03:22.867
His son, however,
was a big disappointment,

03:22.934 --> 03:24.266
Henry Fjord, Jr.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.867
He didn't want to follow
in his father's footsteps.

03:26.934 --> 03:28.934
He thought scum was beneath him.

03:29.800 --> 03:34.400
I just realized the best reason of all
to join this walkathon.

03:34.467 --> 03:36.800
-What's that?
-I get away from this ditz

03:36.867 --> 03:38.100
for a whole day.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.300
Hi, Rose.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.233
What you doing?

03:55.567 --> 04:00.266
Oh, it's a variation on an old idea.
Homemade Mr. Potato heads.

04:00.333 --> 04:03.934
You take a baked potato
and you give him tow little raisin eyes

04:04.000 --> 04:06.600
and a carrot nose and a cucumber mouth.

04:07.133 --> 04:09.600
Do you think we should give him
some broccoli hair?

04:10.800 --> 04:14.834
Why not add a gold chain,
we'll call it Sammy Potato Jr.

04:16.967 --> 04:19.734
I do not know how I let you two
talk me into this thing.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.934
Those kids are going to break
everything in this house.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.266
Come on, Blanche,
you are over reacting.

04:24.333 --> 04:26.266
Now, for the past two days
all you've done

04:26.333 --> 04:29.567
is take everything we own
and put it up on high shelves.

04:30.066 --> 04:32.867
-Well, I'm off. Wish me luck.
-Oh, good luck, Sophia.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.266
Ma, are you sure about this?

04:40.333 --> 04:42.500
I'm not even sure I have these pants on
right.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.834
Listen, I want you to go slow
and pace yourself.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.700
That's what I used to tell your father.

04:49.166 --> 04:51.433
The only thing he did faster
than eat was make love.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.767
And in both cases before I was finished,

04:53.834 --> 04:55.867
he'd pat his stomach and say,
I've had enough.

05:01.133 --> 05:03.066
I wish you girls would help me
get this house ready.

05:03.133 --> 05:05.433
Those little monsters are going
to be here any minute.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.834
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh.

05:11.367 --> 05:14.333
Hi. I'm Bob Henderson.
This is my son, Norman.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.200
Hi, Norman. My name is Rose.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.900
You ready to have some fun?

05:20.633 --> 05:21.700
Yes, ma'am.

05:22.367 --> 05:24.633
Here's a list of Norman's likes
and dislikes.

05:26.667 --> 05:29.200
-But these are only dislikes.
-Yeah, that's my Norman.

05:29.667 --> 05:33.066
Fortunately, for today he's your Norman.
Bye-bye.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.200
Norman, meet my friends.
This is Dorothy.

05:38.266 --> 05:41.433
-Hello, Norman.
-It's the bride of Frankenstein!

05:43.166 --> 05:44.834
And I'm Blanche.

05:44.900 --> 05:48.100
Can I interest you
in some arts and crafts?

05:48.700 --> 05:51.734
-This really bites.
-What would you like to do?

05:52.200 --> 05:54.000
I like army men.

05:54.066 --> 05:58.467
There was a colonel here on Tuesday,
but he had to go back to the base.

05:59.900 --> 06:02.867
He means those little guys
with the helmets.

06:02.934 --> 06:04.867
Sorry. I only date officers.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.300
Would you like to play
with the potato head?

06:09.367 --> 06:11.333
Sure. What do you feel like doing?

06:33.734 --> 06:35.934
That was fun. You want to try it again?

06:37.667 --> 06:40.266
-Are the babies asleep yet?
-No. They're pretending.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.934
They want me to leave so they can make fun
of how I change diapers.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.333
Oh, Dorothy, that's silly.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.934
I bet they have only nice things
to say about you.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.066
Rose, I wasn't serious.
I know babies can't talk.

06:53.133 --> 06:55.200
Oh, yes, they can.

06:55.533 --> 06:57.934
It's just that they're only understood
by other babies...

06:58.600 --> 07:01.500
and advanced civilizations
far, far away.

07:02.533 --> 07:04.934
Like where, Rose, Vero beach?

07:07.734 --> 07:10.700
-Child, what are you doing?
-Nothing.

07:10.767 --> 07:13.367
You're ripping the pages
out of that book!

07:13.433 --> 07:15.934
Somebody should take
a hickory switch to your behind.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.533
Calm down. Let me show you how
a professional teacher deals with this.

07:25.266 --> 07:29.033
Norman, why are you ripping the pages
out of that book?

07:29.100 --> 07:30.567
Because my daddy's rich.

07:32.300 --> 07:36.300
There are boys and girls less
fortunate than you

07:36.367 --> 07:38.133
who have never even seen a book.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.567
Hey, everybody's got their sad stories.

07:42.567 --> 07:43.834
He's all yours, Blanche.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.533
How about a game of hide and seek?

07:49.600 --> 07:51.333
-Yeah!
-Sure!

07:51.400 --> 07:52.633
How about you, Norman?

07:53.300 --> 07:55.533
Isn't that outfit a little young for you?

07:56.567 --> 07:58.233
Come on, Norman. Let's go.

08:00.533 --> 08:02.934
-That boy hates me.
-Oh, no, he doesn't.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.467
But he's right about the outfit.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.300
Oh, Dorothy, you don't understand.

08:08.934 --> 08:11.266
I've never felt
comfortable around children,

08:11.333 --> 08:12.633
and they can sense it.

08:13.233 --> 08:16.266
I was never really a child myself.

08:16.333 --> 08:20.266
From the time I entered school,
I always behaved like a mature young lady.

08:20.633 --> 08:23.900
I was the only girl in the fifth grade
whose boyfriend had a fake ID.

08:25.533 --> 08:30.433
If you're going to relate to a child,
it helps to have the mind of a child.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.600
<i>♪ Flim, flam, ziminy zam</i>
<i>I'm the leader of the garbage lid band ♪</i>

08:35.667 --> 08:38.800
Where would you get
a crazy idea like that?

08:38.867 --> 08:42.467
♪ <i>Flim, flam</i>
<i>I'm the leader of the garbage lid band</i> ♪

08:42.533 --> 08:44.200
(babies cry)

08:45.433 --> 08:47.767
-(crying)
-Come on, now, honey,

08:47.834 --> 08:51.834
there's no reason to cry.
Your mommy will be here soon.

08:52.333 --> 08:55.767
-Still no answer at her parents' house.
-They should have been here hours ago.

08:55.834 --> 08:58.333
Call those walkathon people again.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.333
They said they'd let us know

09:00.400 --> 09:03.467
the minute they had information
about her parents.

09:03.533 --> 09:05.667
Why does she keep crying?

09:06.133 --> 09:11.734
She probably misses her mother...
needs to hear a feminine voice.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.567
What was I doing,
my Ben Gazzara impersonation?

09:16.133 --> 09:18.867
Let Blanche try.
You and I aren't having any luck.

09:18.934 --> 09:24.467
Me? I don't know anything about that.
No! I can't... I don't...

09:24.533 --> 09:26.266
(crying stops)

09:29.900 --> 09:32.900
Well, look at that. She likes me.

09:32.967 --> 09:34.834
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh, thank God.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.633
Emily, pack up your diapers,
you're on your way home.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.900
-Ma! Why didn't you use your key?
-I left it home.

09:41.967 --> 09:43.300
I thought it would weigh me down.

09:45.233 --> 09:46.900
Sophia, how did you do?

09:46.967 --> 09:50.400
-Great. Easily a personal best.
-What happened?

09:50.467 --> 09:53.800
The starter fired his pistol.

09:53.867 --> 09:56.967
Like a shot, I left half
my competition in the dust.

09:57.033 --> 09:58.633
You were that fast?

09:58.900 --> 10:01.800
No. It was the over-80 category.
Most of them dropped from fright.

10:04.567 --> 10:06.900
-You're kidding!
-Please!

10:06.967 --> 10:09.367
There's a natural build
to these kind of stories.

10:09.433 --> 10:10.867
Sorry.

10:11.367 --> 10:15.133
So finally, the race was underway.
I start off slow.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.934
I'm cagey like a panther.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.000
When the time is right, I pounce!

10:19.367 --> 10:23.367
The crowd is on its feet.
"Sophia! Sophia!"

10:25.433 --> 10:27.767
My heart is pounding in my ears.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.200
But then again,
it always pounds in my ears.

10:30.967 --> 10:35.233
The finish line was only
200, 300 yards away.

10:35.967 --> 10:38.500
And then it happened,
what every runner dreads...

10:38.967 --> 10:40.100
I hit the wall.

10:40.166 --> 10:44.567
-Ah, you ran out of steam.
-No. I actually hit a wall.

10:47.233 --> 10:49.500
They put up a new Wendy's
on Collins Avenue.

10:50.967 --> 10:55.200
I picked myself up, staggered over
the finish line, and collapsed.

10:56.266 --> 10:58.767
They're talking the covers
of national magazines.

10:59.867 --> 11:03.400
-What's that kid still doing here?
-Her parents haven't come for her yet.

11:03.467 --> 11:08.000
-Maybe they won't come back at all.
-Ma, don't be ridiculous.

11:08.066 --> 11:11.467
You're just overly tired.
Why don't you go to bed?

11:11.533 --> 11:12.533
Good idea.

11:13.767 --> 11:16.233
-(telephone rings)
-If that's <i>Sports Illustrated,</i>

11:16.300 --> 11:17.633
tell them to call back tomorrow.

11:19.166 --> 11:20.233
Hello.

11:20.867 --> 11:22.000
Oh, yes.

11:23.367 --> 11:24.367
I see.

11:25.166 --> 11:28.834
Well, I appreciate that. Thank you.

11:30.133 --> 11:31.934
-Emily's mom?
-The walkathon people.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.633
Everybody's left the staging area.
There's no sign of Emily's parents.

11:37.033 --> 11:38.667
What do we do now?

11:39.133 --> 11:42.967
I'm not sure,
but we might have to start thinking

11:43.033 --> 11:45.700
about the possibility
that Sophia might be right.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.934
Maybe Emily has been abandoned.

11:59.667 --> 12:03.600
Officer, we've tried
to reach them all afternoon.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.367
Sure. I can hold.

12:08.233 --> 12:11.433
Blanche, every time I turn around,
you're holding the baby.

12:11.500 --> 12:15.533
Every time I pick her up,
she goes right back to sleep.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.934
You shouldn't do that.
She'll never get used to sleeping alone.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.800
You never get used to sleeping alone.
I haven't.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.400
Siamese twins sleep alone more
than you do.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.533
-Who are you on the phone with?
-Dorothy's talking to the police

12:31.600 --> 12:32.600
about the baby.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.033
I see. No, no problem.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.100
And that's standard procedure?

12:38.600 --> 12:42.033
We'll discuss it
and come to some kind of decision.

12:42.100 --> 12:43.800
-Thank you very much.
-What did he say?

12:43.867 --> 12:48.734
Since Emily's parents left her
in our care,

12:48.800 --> 12:54.200
we can either wait for the children's
protective services to contact us,

12:54.266 --> 12:55.834
or we can take her in.

12:56.367 --> 13:00.000
-Take her in. Where?
-Around the inseam, Rose.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.066
To the police!

13:04.500 --> 13:08.633
Why should we take her to jail?
She hasn't done anything.

13:09.367 --> 13:12.900
Just because her parents abandoned her
does that mean we should too?

13:12.967 --> 13:15.667
Being abandoned is the worst.

13:15.734 --> 13:18.767
-I know, I was almost abandoned.
-Almost?

13:18.834 --> 13:19.900
I was nine.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.467
It was the last night of the
deep root vegetable carnival.

13:23.533 --> 13:25.767
And I was having the greatest time.

13:26.266 --> 13:31.667
Eating candy, turnips, guessing how many
sweet potatoes were in the glass jar.

13:31.734 --> 13:33.200
Bobbing for yams.

13:33.900 --> 13:38.233
I had a knack of always coming
up with the firmest, most appealing yam.

13:38.300 --> 13:41.367
I was once told that I had the firmest,
most appealing gams.

13:42.467 --> 13:44.166
Blanche, try and stay with us.

13:46.233 --> 13:50.967
The last time I surfaced, clutching
a humdinger of a yam between my teeth...

13:51.633 --> 13:53.400
my parents were gone.

13:53.467 --> 13:56.367
Well, frantically I searched
the carnival grounds.

13:56.433 --> 13:58.834
I was convinced I'd spend
the rest of my days

13:58.900 --> 14:01.166
with the bearded lady as my foster mother.

14:01.834 --> 14:04.834
And the man who hoses down
the elephants as my dad.

14:06.734 --> 14:09.800
Anyway, I was lost and scared.

14:10.667 --> 14:13.367
But then I did what generations
before me had done.

14:13.433 --> 14:16.100
I gazed up into that dark night sky and...

14:16.533 --> 14:19.000
found the bright star
that could guide me home.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.467
The North Star.

14:20.934 --> 14:23.066
Actually it was the Texaco star.

14:26.767 --> 14:30.667
From the service station across the street
our farm was just down the road from it.

14:31.333 --> 14:35.467
Rose, honey, have you been washing
the fruit off before you eat it?

14:40.667 --> 14:43.133
Listen we have a decision
we have to make.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.567
What are we going to do about Emily?

14:44.633 --> 14:47.734
We can do a good job of raising this baby.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.934
Fine, but if she'll stay
another couple of days,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.433
we'll need more diapers
and some food.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.300
I'm thawing some pork chops.

14:55.367 --> 15:00.600
She only has two teeth.
How can she eat a pork chop?

15:00.667 --> 15:04.433
My uncle Lester had only one tooth.
He ate corn on the cob.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.033
Of course, he didn't get
a lot of it into his mouth.

15:10.100 --> 15:13.166
They'd cream what fell on his pants,
and he'd eat it later.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.967
You two go to the store.
I'll stay here with Emily.

15:21.033 --> 15:23.633
Let's go to that all-night market
over on maple.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.633
Do you think it's open?

15:26.700 --> 15:30.266
-That's what all-night usually means.
-Oh, of course.

15:31.767 --> 15:34.367
Creamed what was left on his pants?

15:44.700 --> 15:47.233
We should go to that all-night
market more often.

15:47.300 --> 15:50.467
Why? They're much more expensive.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.467
But where else can you get

15:52.533 --> 15:55.000
beef jerky and <i>Family Circle</i>
this time of night?

15:55.467 --> 15:58.800
Girls, keep it down.
The baby's asleep.

15:59.700 --> 16:02.767
Isn't this amazing?
When the diapers get dirty,

16:02.834 --> 16:04.867
the cute teddy bears disappear.

16:04.934 --> 16:09.166
Whenever my kids' diapers got dirty,
my husband would disappear.

16:10.667 --> 16:13.133
I used to love changing diapers.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.800
Rose, you march to a different drummer.

16:16.867 --> 16:20.400
I didn't hate changing diapers,
but I was never good at it,

16:20.467 --> 16:21.934
especially with the boys.

16:22.333 --> 16:25.200
They had dry bottoms but wet t-shirts

16:25.266 --> 16:27.834
because I always forgot
to point their little ooh-hoohs south.

16:33.900 --> 16:38.633
I didn't even think about that
until Michael was at least six months old.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.233
What's an ooh-hooh?

16:43.400 --> 16:45.200
It's a chocolate soft drink.

16:47.533 --> 16:48.834
I never had one.

16:52.100 --> 16:55.834
We could do a pretty good job
of raising Emily.

16:55.900 --> 16:58.166
I don't know if we'd have the energy...

16:58.467 --> 17:02.333
but it would be easier for us
after all we've been through.

17:02.400 --> 17:05.400
-What have we been through?
-Yellowstone Park, Rose.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.100
Raising children.

17:09.333 --> 17:13.533
My mother always said,
"The older you get, the better you get...

17:13.600 --> 17:14.934
unless you're a banana."

17:17.567 --> 17:20.233
Let's call those child services people

17:20.300 --> 17:22.667
and tell them we want to
raise Emily ourselves.

17:22.734 --> 17:26.533
I only said that hypothetically...

17:26.600 --> 17:29.600
that if we had to,
we could probably do it.

17:29.667 --> 17:33.266
I didn't get to do those special things
with my kids like you all did.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.367
A nanny did that for me.

17:35.433 --> 17:39.233
My child would wake up on Christmas
and run to his nanny.

17:39.300 --> 17:43.633
-Children do that sort of thing.
-How about when they're 21...

17:43.967 --> 17:51.000
and they still don't come to you?
I have a tough time living with that.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.000
I will make sure that
if the time ever comes...

17:56.433 --> 17:58.033
there'll be somebody there for Emily.

18:04.667 --> 18:08.333
(baby cries)

18:08.400 --> 18:13.166
No, sweetheart, precious.
Don't cry, don't cry.

18:13.233 --> 18:16.900
I'm here, I'm here.
You're all right, you're all right.

18:18.934 --> 18:21.667
This reminds me of when
I was a young mother.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.633
Maybe it's because you look
just a tad like my children...

18:26.200 --> 18:28.934
or maybe it's because
I still look like I'm 27.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.633
My, how those years flew by!

18:33.200 --> 18:35.734
Before I knew it, the children were
cleaning out the attic

18:35.800 --> 18:37.266
to start their own places.

18:38.166 --> 18:43.367
When I tried to be happy for them,
I was sadder than ever.

18:43.433 --> 18:45.700
-(coos)
-Why?

18:46.300 --> 18:50.834
Because I realized I'd put myself
ahead of my children

18:50.900 --> 18:52.066
and I'd never have the chance

18:52.133 --> 18:54.467
to make up the time
I didn't spend with them.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.233
Why am I telling you this?

18:57.734 --> 19:02.033
Maybe it's because I wish you were mine,

19:02.100 --> 19:04.533
so I could try it again
with what I now know.

19:06.133 --> 19:09.066
-Is Emily all right?
-Yes. I'll feed her.

19:09.133 --> 19:10.600
How do you know she's hungry?

19:10.667 --> 19:13.133
'Cause she keeps licking her lips
and staring at my chest.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.200
Let's discuss this in the kitchen
so we don't wake ma.

19:18.266 --> 19:21.200
You won't wake Sophia. She is exhausted.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.900
I didn't hear her, but I did hear Emily.

19:24.233 --> 19:28.700
It's nicer having a baby wake you up
than a garbage man.

19:28.767 --> 19:31.333
I never slept with one. I wouldn't know.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.533
90 years of mother here,
and you can't keep her quiet?

19:36.600 --> 19:38.233
What do you think she needs?

19:39.033 --> 19:40.033
A chin.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.367
Babies don't have chins.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.033
Makes it easier to breast-feed.

19:45.433 --> 19:46.567
You had a chin.

19:47.033 --> 19:49.834
But then, we also showed home movies
on your forehead.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.567
-How are you feeling today?
-My ear hurts.

19:56.633 --> 19:59.734
Why should your ear hurt?

19:59.800 --> 20:02.700
From talking on the phone last night
to hundreds of well-wishers.

20:02.767 --> 20:04.367
I'm a sports celebrity.

20:04.433 --> 20:06.333
(doorbell rings)

20:06.400 --> 20:09.800
-Who could that be?
-The paparazzi.

20:09.867 --> 20:12.200
Now I know why
Sean Penn gets so ticked off.

20:18.633 --> 20:20.800
-Can I help you?
-I'm here to pick up Emily.

20:20.867 --> 20:24.100
But child services said
we could keep her till Monday.

20:24.166 --> 20:28.166
-I'm Emily's father.
-How do I know that?

20:28.233 --> 20:32.333
I can see the family resemblance.
Neither one of them can tell time.

20:32.400 --> 20:37.433
You dropped this child off yesterday,
you don't show up until today,

20:37.500 --> 20:40.467
and you didn't call.

20:40.533 --> 20:42.000
I did call, last night.

20:42.300 --> 20:45.667
I spoke to a woman
who won the iron man triathlon.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.033
I don't remember this guy calling.

20:52.100 --> 20:56.700
I said I couldn't pick up Emily
because my wife just had triplets.

20:56.767 --> 20:59.166
I thought you said your wife had gimlets.

20:59.734 --> 21:02.200
I figured if she wants to drink,
that's her business.

21:03.700 --> 21:06.834
-So your wife had triplets!
-What are they?

21:06.900 --> 21:09.500
That's when three babies
are born at the same time.

21:12.633 --> 21:16.900
I appreciate your taking care of Emily.
I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble.

21:16.967 --> 21:20.100
She was no trouble.
She was an angel.

21:20.600 --> 21:24.567
Time to go home, Emily.
It's been nice having you.

21:24.633 --> 21:27.166
-Thanks again.
-You're welcome. Good luck.

21:27.500 --> 21:28.633
Bye-bye, Emily.

21:31.767 --> 21:33.867
-Blanche...
-I'm fine.

21:34.700 --> 21:37.967
You didn't really think
she could stay with us, did you?

21:38.033 --> 21:40.633
No. She was just my last chance

21:40.700 --> 21:44.000
to prove I could
be a good mother and a friend.

21:44.066 --> 21:47.066
Honey, you're still a mother.

21:47.433 --> 21:52.033
Even though your kids are grown up
and act like they don't need you, they do.

21:52.667 --> 21:54.400
I'm not so sure about that, Dorothy.

21:56.600 --> 22:00.400
You're absolutely right, Dorothy.
And I'll tell you something else.

22:00.467 --> 22:03.100
A mother sometimes needs
her children even more.

22:03.166 --> 22:05.533
Thank you, ma. That's sweet.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.066
-Give me $20.
-No.

22:09.700 --> 22:12.934
Did I say a mother needs a child?
I meant roommate.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.900
-Give me $20.
-What for?

22:15.533 --> 22:18.467
Seoul, Korea, 1988, the Olympics.

22:18.533 --> 22:20.734
I'd like to be there competing
for the USA.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.934
Contribute now,
and you get a Sophia lapel pin.

22:24.600 --> 22:25.734
Ok!

22:28.700 --> 22:31.433
-Good luck. We'll be watching.
-Thanks.

22:32.033 --> 22:35.567
Dorothy, if Gladys calls, tell her
I'll be able to make bingo tonight.

22:39.934 --> 22:41.667
Hello. Janet?

22:42.934 --> 22:44.600
This is mama. Hi.

22:45.533 --> 22:46.667
Nothing's wrong.

22:47.333 --> 22:48.934
Do I have to have a reason to call you?

22:49.467 --> 22:51.667
Just thought I'd call
and see how you're doing.

22:52.967 --> 22:53.967
Really?

22:54.967 --> 22:56.300
Well, that's great.

22:58.500 --> 23:03.967
Janet, maybe I could sneak away
for a few days and come see you...

23:05.567 --> 23:06.967
middle of next week, maybe.

23:10.066 --> 23:11.400
Oh, oh.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.100
No, no. I understand. I understand.

23:14.734 --> 23:16.266
How about the next week?

23:19.200 --> 23:21.133
Oh. Uh-huh.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.633
Well, then you pick a time.

23:28.266 --> 23:30.000
Well, honey, I really do want to see you.

23:32.767 --> 23:35.367
I think we have a lot to talk about,
Janet.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.500
I've been thinking a lot about you lately.

23:42.467 --> 23:44.000
You mean this coming weekend?

23:47.767 --> 23:49.266
Well, sure I can.

23:50.700 --> 23:51.700
All right.

23:52.700 --> 23:54.633
All right. I'll see you then. Janet...

23:57.233 --> 23:58.433
I love you, baby.

24:03.734 --> 24:04.900
Bye-bye.

24:12.567 --> 24:18.367
(theme music playing)
