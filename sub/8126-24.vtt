We'll miss the bus.

00:54.887 --> 00:57.555
Be there in a minute.
What's she doing
up there?

00:57.623 --> 00:59.223
Calm down, daddy.

00:59.291 --> 01:01.292
Yeah, arch. Your bus
doesn't leave for an hour.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.227
You got plenty of time.
What's the big rush?

01:03.295 --> 01:06.497
The big rush is,
it takes 40 minutes
to get into Times Square.

01:06.565 --> 01:09.000
It takes five minutes
to walk over
to the bus terminal.

01:09.068 --> 01:11.269
It takes another six minutes
to buy the tickets.

01:11.336 --> 01:15.907
That leaves only four minutes
for your mother-in-law to go
to the ladies room,

01:15.975 --> 01:18.109
which she's always got to do.

01:18.177 --> 01:20.545
That's why I never wanna
take her no place.

01:20.612 --> 01:23.882
Edith, hurry up
or the ladies room is out!

01:25.151 --> 01:27.085
Go on. Get her, will you?

01:27.153 --> 01:30.121
For a guy who's been
complaining about this trip
for the last three weeks,

01:30.189 --> 01:33.524
you sure seem in
a hurry to get there.
It'll be a cold day in hell...

01:33.592 --> 01:36.427
When I'm in a hurry
to see Edith's cousin maude.

01:36.495 --> 01:40.665
I just hate missing buses,
that's all. It started
with me a long time ago.

01:40.733 --> 01:44.002
One day Edith and me,
we got to get over
to bayside hospital.

01:44.070 --> 01:46.971
We missed the q-5 bus.
Had to wait 20 minutes
to get another one.

01:47.039 --> 01:50.541
I thought Edith was
gonna give birth to Gloria
right there on the sidewalk.

01:50.609 --> 01:56.480
When Edith was having Gloria,
you took her to the hospital
on a bus?

01:56.548 --> 02:01.285
That's right, meathead.
The subway don't run to bayside.

02:01.353 --> 02:05.389
Come on, Edith.
I'm all packed, Archie.

02:05.457 --> 02:08.793
Oh, my, it's gonna be
so exciting.

02:08.860 --> 02:10.794
We'll be so busy.

02:10.863 --> 02:13.397
There's the bridal
shower tonight,

02:13.465 --> 02:16.167
and then tomorrow
is the bridal supper.

02:16.235 --> 02:18.937
And, of course,
Saturday is the big day.

02:19.004 --> 02:20.939
Wrong, Edith.
Sunday's the big day.

02:21.006 --> 02:23.942
That's the day
we take the bus home.

02:24.009 --> 02:28.079
If your cousin maude says
one wrong word to me,

02:28.147 --> 02:32.316
we're gonna be leaving
before the bride
takes the shower.

02:32.384 --> 02:35.820
Daddy, her only daughter's
getting married.

02:35.888 --> 02:39.257
Cousin maude will be
in a good mood. She'll
welcome you with open arms.

02:39.324 --> 02:41.259
I don't care
what she's got open,

02:41.326 --> 02:43.327
as long as she's got
her big mouth closed.

02:43.395 --> 02:45.596
Get everything here.
Good-bye.

02:45.664 --> 02:48.032
See you later, arch.
Bye, ma. Have a good time.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.801
Oh, we will.

02:49.869 --> 02:53.337
Maude was thrilled when
I told her we was coming.

02:53.405 --> 02:56.908
Look, I don't want
Archie bunker here
any more than you do.

02:56.976 --> 02:59.210
I invited Edith
because I love her.

02:59.278 --> 03:02.546
And everywhere Edith goes,
Archie goes.
Like that vaudeville act.

03:02.614 --> 03:06.417
There's the front end
of the horse
and then there's Archie.

03:06.485 --> 03:09.888
But, mother, inviting him
was such a rotten thing to do.

03:09.955 --> 03:11.890
You never said a word
about the bunkers,

03:11.957 --> 03:14.058
and the guest list
was made up six weeks ago.

03:14.126 --> 03:17.962
Honey, if I had told you then,
we would have fought
for a month and a half.

03:18.030 --> 03:21.732
This way it's only
a one-hour brawl
and I win.

03:21.801 --> 03:26.671
But, mother, Archie could
wreck the whole wedding,
and you know that.

03:26.738 --> 03:29.573
And what's gonna happen
when he finds out
that David is Jewish?

03:29.641 --> 03:32.010
I can hear him now.

03:32.077 --> 03:35.546
"Good night, nurse.
She's marrying a Jew."

03:35.614 --> 03:38.883
Well, let him.
David will know
how to handle it.

03:38.951 --> 03:41.485
He'll spot Archie
for what he is right away.

03:41.553 --> 03:46.657
Being Jewish
he has that wonderful
sensitivity that I love so much.

03:46.725 --> 03:48.659
It's a trait of theirs.

03:53.199 --> 03:55.233
A trait of theirs?

03:55.301 --> 03:57.435
Mother, will you
listen to yourself?

03:57.502 --> 04:01.572
What you have just
said is a reverse
anti-semitic cliche.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.876
You can say that to me?

04:04.944 --> 04:08.412
Why, just last month
I had a tree planted
in Israel.

04:11.217 --> 04:13.218
I happen to feel
that Jews are brilliant,

04:13.285 --> 04:16.988
which is why I have
a Jewish doctor and a Jewish
lawyer and a Jewish accountant.

04:17.055 --> 04:20.124
You forgot to mention
your brilliant
Jewish plumber.

04:20.192 --> 04:22.927
Walter, please,
your daughter
and I are fighting.

04:22.995 --> 04:25.163
I have just been accused
of being anti-semitic.

04:25.231 --> 04:27.531
I never said
you were anti-semitic.

04:27.599 --> 04:32.803
You bet I'm not.
I happen to be
a Hubert Humphrey democrat.

04:32.872 --> 04:35.373
What does that mean?

04:35.440 --> 04:37.842
It means she's
not anti-anything.

04:40.612 --> 04:43.581
Carol, when the rosenblatts
moved in next door,

04:43.648 --> 04:46.184
wasn't I the first one
to go over and welcome them?

04:46.252 --> 04:49.087
And they have been constantly
in and out of this house
ever since.

04:49.154 --> 04:50.721
But you hate the rosenblatts.

04:50.789 --> 04:53.724
Because they are constantly
in and out of this house.

04:55.594 --> 04:58.029
I can't tell you
how I'm dreading this shower.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.731
I don't know why you had
to involve me in a wedding
in the first place.

05:00.799 --> 05:04.769
David and I have this
terrific relationship going
just as it is.

05:04.836 --> 05:07.772
Why take a chance
on messing it up
by getting married?

05:07.839 --> 05:12.610
Honey, I know you're
just upset because I didn't
tell you about the bunkers.

05:12.677 --> 05:15.446
It's not just the bunkers.
It's this whole
archaic ritual...

05:15.514 --> 05:19.317
Of bridal showers
and wedding gifts
and "thank you" notes.

05:19.385 --> 05:22.921
Carol, I hate bridal showers
as much as you do,

05:22.988 --> 05:25.723
but after the hundreds
of gifts that I've given
through the years,

05:25.791 --> 05:29.227
my daughter is going
to get hers.

05:31.063 --> 05:32.997
Maude, you're
a crass materialist.

05:33.065 --> 05:36.534
Right, and you're
going to profit by it.

05:36.601 --> 05:39.170
Maude--
please, Walter,
we're still fighting.

05:39.238 --> 05:42.840
Good. While you're hot,
we got a little problem
with Mr. dishwasher over here.

05:42.908 --> 05:46.677
He wasn't able to fix the thing,
but he still wants 15 bucks
for a house call.

05:46.745 --> 05:48.212
You're kidding.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.848
That's right, lady.
That's what I get.

05:50.916 --> 05:53.952
Come over here.
What's your name, honey?

05:54.019 --> 05:56.687
Marvin.
Marvin. Listen, Marvin.

05:56.755 --> 06:02.360
A lot of people might feel that
charging $15 for a house call
is unreasonable,

06:02.428 --> 06:05.430
and I'd like you
to count me among them.

06:05.497 --> 06:09.968
Now, look, lady--
quiet. I'll tell you what
we're going to do, Marvin.

06:10.035 --> 06:12.036
I am going
to give you this money...

06:12.104 --> 06:15.139

with this thought in mind.

"I have just made $2.00
for doing absolutely nothing."

06:20.479 --> 06:23.448

No need
to thank me, Marvin.

06:23.515 --> 06:27.018

that is
a sweet smile, Marvin.

you'd be gorgeous.

more reserved type

more dominant than charming
personality, is the killer.

To tell you I can't take you
to the bachelor party.

so I have to pick him up,
which gives me a full car.

You know fat Bernie.
But don't worry about it.
Tommy's gonna pick you up.

07:21.240 --> 07:26.544
David, it is unlucky
for the groom to fondle
the bride before the wedding.

07:26.611 --> 07:29.113
Can I fondle the mother?

07:29.181 --> 07:31.315
I'll fondle the father.
Oh, get out of here.

in that wedding dress.

I wanted to ask you
about that dress.

07:39.958 --> 07:44.062
What? Don't you like it?
It's fine, but how come
you're gonna wear white?

07:48.700 --> 07:52.736
Because after the wedding,
I'm gonna sell good humors.

07:53.872 --> 07:56.474
Walter, brides wear white.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.842
It's a symbol
of purity and innocence.

07:58.910 --> 08:02.447
And for what you're thinking,
bite your tongue.

08:02.514 --> 08:04.715
I was just wondering,
that's all.

08:04.783 --> 08:07.351
She was married before.
She has an eight-year-old son.

08:07.419 --> 08:10.054
She's had
a half dozen affairs.

08:10.122 --> 08:13.491

how did she manage
that tricky u-turn...

08:13.559 --> 08:16.227
Back to purity and innocence?

08:20.165 --> 08:24.302
God'll get you
for that, Walter.

08:24.369 --> 08:28.339
Walter, I'm wearing white
because mother insisted
that I wear white.

08:28.407 --> 08:30.608
If I had my own way,
I'd wear pink polka dots.

08:30.675 --> 08:33.177
And as for that bit
about the bride
being virginal...

08:33.245 --> 08:35.313
While the groom
can be anything he wants...

08:35.380 --> 08:38.649
Is just another example
of typical male chauvinism.

08:38.717 --> 08:43.886
Oh, come on.
And you talk
about women's lib.

08:43.955 --> 08:47.358
Walter, I am shocked.
How can you talk
to your daughter that way?

08:47.426 --> 08:50.561
She's not my daughter.
She's your second husband's

11:35.394 --> 11:38.396
What do you mean?
One of them fun
bachelor parties?

11:38.463 --> 11:40.864
Yeah. All the guys
are chipping in
ten bucks apiece.

11:40.932 --> 11:45.536
Hold it. Hold it.
Include me out
of that there.

11:45.604 --> 11:49.774
Leave it to a hebe to charge
admission to his own party.

11:49.841 --> 11:52.777
What's he gonna do,
sell tickets
to the wedding too?

11:52.844 --> 11:54.779
He's all yours, maude.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.549
You know what I like
about you, Archie?

11:58.617 --> 12:01.352
- What's that, maude?
- Nothing.

12:02.554 --> 12:04.488
Maude, I ain't blind.

12:04.556 --> 12:07.291
I notice since I come in here
you try to insult me.

12:07.359 --> 12:11.629
Mother, for your sake, I'm
trying to control myself,
but if he isn't out--

12:11.697 --> 12:14.799
Archie, the shower
is for ladies.

12:14.866 --> 12:17.601
And since you ain't going
to the bachelor party,

12:17.669 --> 12:19.903
wouldn't you
like to go back
to the motel?

12:19.971 --> 12:22.940
Oh, no, Edith.
No dice to that.

12:23.007 --> 12:25.209
I ain't going nowhere
without you.

12:25.276 --> 12:29.647
I'm staying here.
I'm gonna plant myself right in
the middle of this here couch.

12:29.715 --> 12:33.517
[ Doorbell rings ]
What did I tell you, mother?
I knew he'd do something.

12:33.585 --> 12:36.220
I don't know
why the-- hello!

12:39.023 --> 12:40.958
How are you?

12:42.293 --> 12:46.096
Ladies, ladies, come with me.
Come with me.

12:46.164 --> 12:48.432
Ladies! Ladies!

12:48.500 --> 12:50.568
I have something
to show you.

12:52.637 --> 12:54.972
This is a Mr. bunker.

12:55.039 --> 13:00.110
And he insists on staying
with us girls for the shower.

13:03.014 --> 13:06.784
Edith! Edith! Edith!

13:06.852 --> 13:08.285
Come here.

13:08.353 --> 13:10.287
You ain't Edith.
Get out of here.

13:10.355 --> 13:12.723
Edith! Edith!

13:12.791 --> 13:15.058
Get over here.
Yeah, Archie.

13:15.126 --> 13:19.864
I'm going. You got your way.
Stay here. Enjoy yourself
with your dopey friends.

13:19.931 --> 13:22.366
I'll go back to the motel
and stay there all alone.

13:22.434 --> 13:24.101
Oh, Archie.

13:24.168 --> 13:27.170
Don't worry, Edith.
He can go back
and watch television.

13:27.238 --> 13:31.074
Governor Wallace is
on the <i>tonight show</i>
<i>and he'll love it.</i>

13:38.784 --> 13:41.886
Bye, darling.
Thank you all for coming.

13:41.953 --> 13:44.588
Thank you, sweetheart.
It was just lovely.

13:44.656 --> 13:46.724
Give my love to Roger.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.726
My God, I'm tired.

13:49.994 --> 13:53.597
That was the best shower
I've ever been to.

13:53.665 --> 13:56.834
Oh, the presents
is so beautiful,

13:56.902 --> 13:59.437
and some of them
was so funny.

13:59.504 --> 14:01.439
I thought I'd die...

14:01.506 --> 14:06.009
When that girl gave you
a box of nodoz
for your honeymoon.

14:06.077 --> 14:09.680
I'm glad you liked
that one, Edith.

14:09.748 --> 14:11.682
Oh, I loved it,

14:11.750 --> 14:15.285
especially after
you explained it to me.

14:17.288 --> 14:19.222
Edith,
you're wonderful.

14:19.290 --> 14:21.792
[ Boy ]
Mommy, I want
a drink of water.

14:21.860 --> 14:24.795
Phillip's awake.
I'll be right there, honey.

14:24.863 --> 14:28.966
Let me take it to him, Carol.
I'll tell him a story.

14:29.033 --> 14:32.402
Oh, I ain't told
a bedtime story for years.

14:32.471 --> 14:36.707
- Thanks, Edith. You're a doll.
- Carol, let's have a drink.

14:36.775 --> 14:38.809
We'll clean up
the mess later.
Good idea.

14:38.877 --> 14:41.144
A final toast.

14:41.212 --> 14:46.149
This is the second shower
I've thrown for you,
and may it be the last.

14:46.217 --> 14:49.553
Actually, you haven't
thrown me two showers.
This is the first.

14:49.621 --> 14:52.255
This is your
second marriage.
So?

14:52.323 --> 14:56.794
So, I counted it up
on my little fingers and
that comes to two showers.

14:56.862 --> 15:00.998
Count again, mother.
Pete and I eloped.
Sweetheart, two showers.

15:01.065 --> 15:04.067
One before you
eloped with Peter
and one before David.

15:04.135 --> 15:07.505
Mother, you don't have
elopement showers.

15:07.572 --> 15:10.908
The shower you're thinking of
is the one I threw for you
when you married Walter.

15:10.976 --> 15:15.546
Honey, you threw me a shower
when I married Albert,
not Walter.

15:15.614 --> 15:18.215
Mother, you're getting senile.
You eloped with Albert.

15:18.282 --> 15:20.885
Look, don't tell me
who I eloped with.

15:20.952 --> 15:25.122
I eloped with your father
and with Fred, not Albert.

15:25.189 --> 15:27.591
I threw you a shower,
and it wasn't Albert.

15:27.659 --> 15:30.193
Now, honey, look.
Listen to mother.

15:31.763 --> 15:36.534
In 12 years, we have had
three showers, right?

15:36.601 --> 15:39.737
So that means you threw me
either Albert or Walter...

15:39.804 --> 15:41.906
Because I threw you
Peter and David.

15:41.973 --> 15:45.910
I threw you Walter,
but you did not throw me
Pete and David, just David.

15:45.977 --> 15:48.946
At least we agree
on David and Walter.
Right.

15:49.014 --> 15:52.550
And then I threw
you Peter.

15:52.617 --> 15:54.752
You did not.

15:54.819 --> 15:58.589
Four days before
you married Peter,
I threw you a shower.

15:58.657 --> 16:00.357
Mother, that's impossible.

16:00.425 --> 16:03.493
Pete and I were living together.
People thought we were
already married.

16:03.562 --> 16:06.296
That's it.
It was a baby shower.

16:07.999 --> 16:12.335
Get away from me.
What a party.
What a terrific party.

16:12.403 --> 16:14.972
Close the door,
stupid.
What are you so angry about?

16:15.040 --> 16:17.808
- You were
the life of the party.
- David, Walter, what happened?

16:17.876 --> 16:20.544
Thanks to David
and his friends,
the police raided the party.

16:20.612 --> 16:23.781
- The police raided the party?
- What do you mean the police
raided the party?

16:23.848 --> 16:27.417
What police? What raid?
Two cops? One was short.

16:27.485 --> 16:30.588
Walter, you were
the oldest boy there, and I
hold you directly responsible.

16:30.655 --> 16:33.290
And I should've known
when your friends got
that motel suite...

16:33.357 --> 16:35.292
That some girls
would show up.

16:35.359 --> 16:37.527
David, there were girls
at your party?

16:37.596 --> 16:40.631
Why not?
You had girls
at your party.

16:40.699 --> 16:42.633
That's not funny, David.

16:42.701 --> 16:48.305
If you blew that boy's
bachelor party, I am sending
back the king-size bed.

16:48.372 --> 16:51.742
David, just how many girls
were at the party?

16:51.810 --> 16:54.078
Well, let's see.
There were
the two brunettes.

16:54.145 --> 16:57.081
- There was a redhead
with a guitar.
- Don't forget the belly dancer.

16:57.148 --> 16:59.382
The belly dancer?
There was
a belly dancer.

16:59.450 --> 17:02.019
There was a redhead
with a guitar.
You already mentioned her.

17:02.087 --> 17:05.321
Yeah, she was the standout.
She rode him around
the room piggyback...

17:05.388 --> 17:08.258
Singing
"marching to pretoria."

17:08.326 --> 17:10.227
David!

17:10.294 --> 17:12.295
What's the matter?
You don't like that song?

17:14.265 --> 17:16.967
I can't believe this.
That's what you do.
It's a bachelor party.

17:17.035 --> 17:19.637
You fool around.
Two days
before the wedding?

17:19.704 --> 17:21.771
We're individuals, right?
You got two days.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.842
You can fool around
if you want.
That's not the point.

17:24.909 --> 17:29.412
Wait a minute. What
happened to that liberated
female I'm gonna married...

17:29.480 --> 17:31.715
With all those speeches
that come pouring out
of your mouth,

17:31.783 --> 17:33.717
all those liberal views?

17:33.785 --> 17:37.054
You're right, David.
I'm sorry.

17:37.122 --> 17:40.691
Anything you did at
your bachelor party is okay.
After all, I'm no angel myself.

17:40.759 --> 17:44.327
- And that's the truth, David.
- Mother, please.

17:44.395 --> 17:45.929
What's the difference?

17:45.997 --> 17:48.498
Once we're married, I won't
be fooling around anymore.

17:48.566 --> 17:51.702
We'll be living in that
new house I bought today,
and everything will be fine.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.938
- What?
- Oh!

17:55.006 --> 17:57.675
I wanted it
to be a surprise.

17:57.742 --> 18:00.010
I bought us
a new house today.

18:00.078 --> 18:02.846
You bought a house today?
<i>Tudor.</i>

18:02.914 --> 18:05.849
He bought you a house.
Oh, you darling,
you bought her a house.

18:05.917 --> 18:07.851
Mother, this is
between David and me.
You bought a house...

18:07.919 --> 18:10.520
And you didn't ask me about it?
Wait till you see
the kitchen.

18:10.588 --> 18:13.323
The kitchen
is fabulous.
I'm not gonna be in the kitchen.

18:13.391 --> 18:15.325
Electric stove.
I don't even like to cook.

18:15.393 --> 18:17.828
When you quit your job,
you'll love to cook.
I'm gonna decorate.

18:17.896 --> 18:20.898
Wait. Stop. Go back.
I'm gonna decorate.

18:20.965 --> 18:23.901
Further than that.
About my job.
And you quit your job.

18:23.968 --> 18:26.170
Uh-uh. I'm not
gonna quit my job.

18:26.237 --> 18:28.471
Of course you're
gonna quit your job.

18:28.539 --> 18:31.641
Who's gonna
take care of the kids?
Kids?

18:31.710 --> 18:35.679
We're gonna have three kids--
you have decided
on three children...

18:35.747 --> 18:38.682
- And you haven't asked me?
- You'll get them.
You'll get them.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.952
Mother, will you go
over there and sit down?
But, honey--

18:42.020 --> 18:44.888
- Walter.
- Maude, sit.

18:50.862 --> 18:53.463
What if I don't
want any more kids?
I already have one.

18:53.531 --> 19:00.204
That's right.
She already has a kid.
Phillip is not dumb.

19:00.271 --> 19:04.341
David, suppose I don't want
any more children?

19:04.408 --> 19:09.113
Of course you're
gonna want children.
That's a woman's function--

19:09.180 --> 19:11.514
[ screams ]
I don't believe
I'm hearing this.

19:11.582 --> 19:14.317
I don't believe you've
planned my whole life for me
without consulting me.

19:14.385 --> 19:18.155
You bought a house.
I had to move fast on the house.
That was a good bargain.

19:18.223 --> 19:21.158
I should've known
you couldn't pass up
a good bargain.

19:25.196 --> 19:28.766
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I don't know.

19:28.833 --> 19:31.635
Is that some reference
to the fact that I'm Jewish?

19:31.702 --> 19:34.872
Do you wanna see if I bleed?
You wanna see if a Jew bleeds?

19:34.939 --> 19:38.108
Walter, give me the knife.
You want a pound of my blood?

19:38.176 --> 19:41.011
- Don't be foolish.
- David, stop it.

19:41.079 --> 19:43.647
What's the matter with you
people? Don't you know Jews
are like everybody else?

19:43.714 --> 19:46.850
We drink,
we gamble, corral,
unfaithful to our wives.

19:46.918 --> 19:48.852
That's not true.

19:48.920 --> 19:52.289
Everybody knows
that Jewish boys
make the best husbands.

19:52.356 --> 19:54.291
It's a known fact.
Look it up.

19:54.358 --> 19:58.061
On the surface,
that sounds all right, but
that's an anti-semitic remark.

19:58.129 --> 20:00.898
Walter, come on. Let's go.
It's your turn. Let's go.

20:00.965 --> 20:04.001
Well, you are talking
with your hands.
Walter!

20:04.068 --> 20:08.138
He's kidding! He's kidding!
Tell him you're kidding!

20:08.206 --> 20:11.241
I knew it.
I was waiting for this.

20:11.309 --> 20:14.211
My mother told me it might take
a year, two years, maybe three,

20:14.279 --> 20:17.681
but sooner or later,
if I married into this family,
one of you would crack,

20:17.748 --> 20:20.184
and the anti-semitic remarks
would come pouring out.

20:20.251 --> 20:23.787
Hold on just a minute.
You said you've been
waiting for this.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.956
You've been waiting
for something like this
to happen.

20:26.024 --> 20:28.692
For two years,
while I've been loving you,

20:28.759 --> 20:32.162
you've been waiting for me
to make an anti-semitic remark.

20:32.230 --> 20:36.666
Do you know what that is?
That is anti-gentile feeling
on your part.

20:36.734 --> 20:39.136
We all feel that way.

20:39.204 --> 20:41.738
Aha!
Aha!

20:46.845 --> 20:49.646
I said that?

20:49.714 --> 20:53.550
I said that.
That came out of my-- wow.

20:53.617 --> 20:56.920
Well, that's, uh--
well, where do we go from here?

20:56.988 --> 20:59.456
I'll tell you exactly
where we go from here.
Walter, get the champagne,

20:59.523 --> 21:01.458
and we'll forget everything
that's been said.

21:01.525 --> 21:04.161
Mother, it's not possible
to forget everything
that's been said.

21:04.229 --> 21:07.497
I'm really
surprised at you.
David, you gave me no idea.

21:07.565 --> 21:11.235
The wedding is off.
To the bride
and groom.

21:11.302 --> 21:14.671
Not to this
bride and groom.
To freedom.

21:14.739 --> 21:17.607
To my new house with
the "for sale" sign
in front.

21:17.675 --> 21:20.878
To the bride and groom.
To living my own life.

21:20.945 --> 21:23.881
I said,
"to the bride and groom."

21:23.948 --> 21:27.017
You don't understand.
David and I have decided
to cool it.

21:27.085 --> 21:30.921
Cool it?
What does that mean?
That means the wedding is off.

21:30.989 --> 21:34.858
What? Thirty women just ate
$200 worth of food here.

21:34.926 --> 21:39.396
I got a banquet hall hired
and a caterer waiting
for the reception.

21:39.463 --> 21:41.398
Can I see you
for a moment?
Yes.

21:46.404 --> 21:50.707
I know. I guess
we have a lot to talk about.

21:50.775 --> 21:52.709
I'll call you.

21:54.745 --> 21:56.679
We'll have coffee.
Okay.

21:56.747 --> 22:01.018
Wait a minute, David.
Where you going?
I said wait a minute.

22:01.085 --> 22:03.420
What am I gonna do
with a three-piece band?

22:03.487 --> 22:06.723
Tell them to play
"marching to pretoria."

22:06.791 --> 22:09.726
David. David! David! David!

22:09.794 --> 22:13.496
See you next week
at the American civil
liberties meeting?

22:29.247 --> 22:31.181
Oh, Carol, honey.

22:33.217 --> 22:36.186
You know, I'm not
very good at quiet talk.

22:36.254 --> 22:39.423
Yelling is my long suit.

22:39.490 --> 22:43.893
I don't know.
I'm trying to say something
and I hope it comes out right.

22:43.962 --> 22:46.229
What I'm trying to say is,

22:46.297 --> 22:48.731
I want you to know that I care.

22:50.501 --> 22:52.735
I know you care.

22:52.803 --> 22:55.839
Thank you, mother.
Oh, honey, listen.

22:55.906 --> 22:57.975
Everything passes in time.

22:58.042 --> 23:00.910
And who knows?
David may still work out.

23:00.979 --> 23:04.681
Even if it doesn't,
it'll work out with
somebody else. Look at us.

23:04.748 --> 23:08.185
It took your mother
four tries before she
was lucky enough to get me.

23:08.252 --> 23:10.487
See why I love that man?

23:10.554 --> 23:12.555
His modesty.

23:12.623 --> 23:17.160
What's going on?
Am I missing something?

23:17.228 --> 23:19.762
Only the wedding, Edith.
It's off.

23:19.830 --> 23:22.932
Oh. I wondered
what she was laughing at.

23:23.001 --> 23:27.837
Geez, I'm glad
somebody's laughing
and having a good time here.

23:27.905 --> 23:29.973
Archie, what are
you doing here?

23:30.041 --> 23:33.510
The same thing I was doing
at the motel, Edith--
not sleeping.

23:33.577 --> 23:36.246
They was having
a wild party over there.
People screaming and yelling.

23:36.314 --> 23:38.482
One crazy dame
was marching to astoria.

23:42.820 --> 23:44.787
Around 11:00
I couldn't take it no more.

23:44.855 --> 23:48.058
I had to call the cops
to come and break it up.

23:53.631 --> 23:55.565
I should've known.

23:55.633 --> 23:59.036
I should've known too, maude.
I never would've went
to the joint.

23:59.103 --> 24:01.038
You fink.
Huh?

24:01.105 --> 24:03.740
If you hadn't
called the cops,
nothing would have happened.

24:03.807 --> 24:05.975
What is she talking about?
If there hadn't
been a raid,

24:06.044 --> 24:07.977
there never would have been
this fight here tonight.

24:08.046 --> 24:10.514
Archie, you have ruined
my daughter's wedding.

24:10.581 --> 24:15.985
Well, then that
makes us even, maudie,
'cause you ruined my weekend.

24:16.054 --> 24:19.222
Ow!

24:19.290 --> 24:21.324
You stepped on my foot.

24:27.998 --> 24:31.034
Maude, I had
a marvelous time.

24:31.102 --> 24:34.571
Carol, I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

24:34.638 --> 24:37.807
Thanks, Edith.
Yeah, Carol,
I was gonna tell you--

24:37.875 --> 24:40.677
Archie, there's
no need to apologize.

24:40.744 --> 24:42.946
All you did was
mess up a party.

24:43.013 --> 24:44.948
I messed up my own wedding.

24:45.015 --> 24:47.951
That's what
I was gonna tell you.
It ain't my fault.

24:50.754 --> 24:52.689
Come on, Edith.
We've got a long trip.

24:52.756 --> 24:54.991
Let's get going.
Bye. Bye.

24:55.059 --> 24:56.993
Keep smiling there, maudie.

24:57.061 --> 25:00.763
Archie. Here.
You don't wanna forget
your wedding present.

25:00.831 --> 25:03.733
Oh, no. I tell you
what you do, maude.

25:03.801 --> 25:07.304
You keep it here on
what you call a deposit
for the next wedding.
