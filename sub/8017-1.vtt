04:15.640 --> 04:17.918
Great job guys, nice fall.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.519
Ah, lovely. Didn't need that one.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.119
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks, Ben.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.959
Ah, cheers, Andy. Sweet, thanks.

04:24.160 --> 04:28.559
I'm Ben Collins. I've been a stunt driver
on Batman, Bond, Fast and Furious.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.740
I've also played
the masked racing driver

04:30.840 --> 04:32.880
on a popular motoring
programme called Top...

04:41.800 --> 04:42.919
Hello, Ben.

04:44.200 --> 04:48.279
Thanks for joining me
at such short notice.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.940
Oh, it's, it's an absolute pleasure.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.959
Uh, do you not think this
would be easier on the phone?

04:53.440 --> 04:56.559
You will soon understand
the need for precautions.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.060
Yep, you're a known paranoid and, uh...

04:59.160 --> 05:01.159
We've known each other
for years, anyway.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.159
- And you're certain of this?
- Your name's Barry.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.300
You're the psychotic stunt coordinator,

05:06.400 --> 05:09.959
uh, whose got, sort of this massively
overblown sense of secrecy.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.359
I brought you here because I need someone
with a very specific set of skills.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.279
Okay, go on.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.639
It's a high-profile feature film

05:19.160 --> 05:21.479
that requires a high-speed car chase.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.919
Well, you have cable-tied
the right man for the job.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.639
The scene is set
at a high-security weapons store,

05:37.880 --> 05:42.199
at a top secret location,
manned by heavily-armed mercenaries.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.679
Some of the guards hear
the sound of an engine roaring to life,

05:47.360 --> 05:50.279
and our hero car,
with you driving, naturally,

05:50.600 --> 05:54.119
leaps up from an underground bay
and the chase is on.

05:54.760 --> 05:57.100
The guards, realising
it's a rogue vehicle,

05:57.200 --> 06:00.140
open fire on the car
that's racing through the weapons store,

06:00.240 --> 06:02.340
avoiding other vehicles and gun fire.

06:02.440 --> 06:03.559
Armed with blanks?

06:03.680 --> 06:05.159
In the main, yes.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.359
- In the main?
- With the alarm raised...

06:07.480 --> 06:10.260
A guard triggers
the electric gate to seal the facility.

06:10.360 --> 06:14.599
You, in the hero car, must make it
through before the gates close.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.300
Providing you get through,
you'll begin to make your escape

06:17.400 --> 06:20.399
off-road around the outer
perimeter of the store.

06:20.960 --> 06:25.420
After avoiding further gunfire,
you will then be pursued by a 4x4.

06:25.520 --> 06:29.519
This means that the hero car
must run well off-road.

06:29.720 --> 06:30.980
Okay, I think I can handle that.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.220
Could you just rewind
to the part about the blanks?

06:33.320 --> 06:35.719
Once you have made your way
onto the main road,

06:36.040 --> 06:39.279
the car needs the speed
to outrun the 4x4.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.540
After this, you'll then
be pursued by two further vehicles,

06:42.640 --> 06:44.700
yet to be decided by the director.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.140
Any idea what they are, or...

06:46.240 --> 06:48.140
The last attack will be from the air,

06:48.240 --> 06:52.020
either by plane, helicopter
or by attack drones.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.660
Naturally, the aircraft will be armed.

06:54.760 --> 06:55.740
With blanks?

06:55.840 --> 06:59.020
The feature film is set in
the present day, so no old stuff.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.940
You have 48 hours to get out there

07:02.040 --> 07:05.079
and find me the perfect car
for this stunt.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.979
Great. You've got yourself
a stunt driver.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.900
Now, although Barry the stunt
coordinator's recruitment techniques

08:49.000 --> 08:52.660
are a bit unorthodox, to say the least,
he does have an exciting mission.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.660
But it's quite a tough one
because it's not that straightforward,

08:55.760 --> 08:59.519
picking a car that performs
just as well off-road as it does on it.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.940
And, I'll tell you now,
I'm not picking an SUV.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.119
They claim to be masters
of everything, but really,

09:06.240 --> 09:08.060
they don't do anything that well.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.239
And the other thing that is playing
on my mind is this aerial attack,

09:11.360 --> 09:13.919
because whether it's
a plane, a heli or a drone,

09:14.040 --> 09:17.559
all of them have a massive top speed,
and I need something that can outrun it.

09:17.880 --> 09:21.799
But I do know a place
where top speed is almost unlimited.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.719
This is Rockingham Motor Speedway,

09:45.880 --> 09:48.380
a 1 .5-mile piece of Americana

09:48.480 --> 09:51.919
that looks like it crash landed in the
middle of the English countryside.

09:57.480 --> 10:01.679
This seven-degree banked super speedway
is the fastest of its kind in Europe.

10:01.960 --> 10:05.839
But, it's not just the track that makes it
feel like you're in the deep south.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.100
Because Rockingham has a fleet

10:09.200 --> 10:11.639
of America's greatest gift
to the motorsport world,

10:12.720 --> 10:13.999
NASCARs.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.540
Born out of the days of moonshiners,

10:16.640 --> 10:20.159
running illegal whisky at high speed
across the southern states.

10:20.600 --> 10:24.279
It's now a multibillion dollar
global motorsport empire.

10:53.440 --> 10:56.980
Now, the secret of NASCAR's
success is its sheer simplicity.

10:57.080 --> 11:00.940
Because, here I am, sitting
inside a space frame cage,

11:01.040 --> 11:03.879
basically covered in steel sheeting.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.620
Up front is a bellowing
V8 push rod engine

11:07.720 --> 11:10.119
that kicks out 600 horsepower,

11:10.520 --> 11:12.679
slaved to the rear axle

11:12.920 --> 11:15.239
by this gigantic prop shaft.

11:15.720 --> 11:19.079
It sits on these great,
big Goodyear bags of rubber

11:19.400 --> 11:22.479
that's gluing me to the track
when I wind the engine up.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.700
Given an open stretch,
easily I can bust it past 200.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.740
And that's enough to keep
a helicopter or a drone

11:32.840 --> 11:35.100
or pretty much whatever it is
that is coming at me

11:35.200 --> 11:37.499
from an aerial attack, on its toes.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.180
Gonna get the hammer down, baby!

11:41.280 --> 11:43.639
Shake and Bake! Shake and Bake!

11:55.320 --> 11:56.759
I just love this car.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.039
It reminds me of the good
old days I had here

12:00.160 --> 12:04.079
racing in the ASCAR series,
when I won the European championship,

12:04.520 --> 12:06.599
and set the lap record,
which still stands.

12:12.760 --> 12:16.380
So, this NASCAR has super speed,
so it gets a massive tick in the box,

12:16.480 --> 12:18.519
in terms of evading aerial attack.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.700
And it can maintain
those speeds for extended periods,

12:21.800 --> 12:23.559
so, another important tick there.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.460
The only thing that is troubling me,
when I'm travelling in a straight line,

12:28.560 --> 12:32.079
I have to turn the steering
wheel quite a long way to the right.

12:32.480 --> 12:36.839
That's because this car is built
to turn left and kind of only left.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.940
So, what I'm gonna do is
take it onto the infield

12:40.040 --> 12:42.399
and see how it fares when I turn right.

12:45.040 --> 12:48.039
It's so unstable
and the brake pedal is so stiff.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.639
Jeez.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.999
Okay, that wasn't very good
or dignified.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.980
The brakes just aren't
designed to be leant on that hard,

13:06.080 --> 13:08.119
because you hardly brake on the oval.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.620
Because the wheels are pointing
the wrong way, when I turn right,

13:12.720 --> 13:14.700
you just get this massive understeer,

13:14.800 --> 13:17.020
touch the throttle
and the back end lights up,

13:17.120 --> 13:19.660
because the axle's pointing
the wrong way as well.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.839
It's like driving, I don't know...

13:22.440 --> 13:23.519
A wheelie bin.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.660
Here we go.
There's another tight hairpin.

13:29.760 --> 13:30.759
I'm dreading this.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.479
Keep turning, keep turning,
nothing's happening.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.879
I think I'll be doing that all day long.

13:42.480 --> 13:46.559
I love this baby, but I think I'll have
to retire it and find something else.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.239
Something like that looks pretty nice.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.919
Now, I know Barry said no old cars,

14:01.200 --> 14:04.479
but if it was good enough for Steve
McQueen in Bullitt, it'd be rude not to.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.159
Now, this is a bit more like it!

14:14.280 --> 14:16.159
A proper American muscle car.

14:16.360 --> 14:22.199
The 1965 Ford Mustang was built to
chew up road courses like this one.

14:26.160 --> 14:29.359
Now I should have no problem
tackling a few lefts and rights.

14:31.680 --> 14:32.940
I love these old cars.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.759
You can feel the heritage of it.
You can smell the leather.

14:38.200 --> 14:41.319
You can smell some gasoline,
actually, to be honest.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.719
You've got lots of movement in the Tyre

14:47.840 --> 14:50.959
that, really, you can embrace it
and drive the car to its limit.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.559
I drove a car just like this one
in Fast and Furious,

15:01.680 --> 15:03.519
chasing through the streets of London.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.879
Now, that high-pitched
sound you're hearing

15:26.600 --> 15:29.420
is the inside wheel spinning,
so there's obviously...

15:29.520 --> 15:32.039
There's no lock diff
in the back putting traction

15:32.160 --> 15:36.620
through both rear tyres, which is
not good for making forward progress.

15:36.720 --> 15:40.519
It's, uh, pretty spongy
and not really that stable,

15:41.040 --> 15:42.799
and the jelly-like suspension...

15:43.080 --> 15:46.159
Well, you can't exactly say
it corners like it's on rails.

15:48.840 --> 15:49.839
Oh!

15:50.320 --> 15:51.679
It's all right, granddad.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.100
The beauty of the '65 Mustang, though,

16:00.200 --> 16:02.439
is it does look the part,
and I'll give it that.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.780
But I don't think
I'll get many points for that

16:04.880 --> 16:06.980
when I'm under attack from live rounds,

16:07.080 --> 16:09.599
from whatever it is that
Barry's got in store for me.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.599
And as much as I love this track
and these machines,

16:17.720 --> 16:19.660
my search is going to
have to Cary on elsewhere,

16:19.760 --> 16:23.039
because I think that when
it really comes down to it,

16:23.640 --> 16:26.079
these old boys are going to let me down.

16:39.080 --> 16:42.280
You have one new message.

16:44.320 --> 16:48.359
Ben, don't think I'm not
monitoring your every move.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.839
I told you, no old cars.

16:51.080 --> 16:54.399
Stop disobeying orders
and carry out the mission.

16:54.600 --> 16:59.259
Otherwise, I will be forced
to take extreme measures.

17:06.119 --> 17:09.500
Now, as much as
I love old school American muscle cars,

17:09.599 --> 17:12.479
those ones just threw up far
more questions than answers.

17:12.599 --> 17:16.559
They are totally impractical,
fragile even by modern standards.

17:16.760 --> 17:20.140
But, what I do still need is something
with the NASCAR top speed

17:20.240 --> 17:21.839
that corners like it's on rails.

17:22.119 --> 17:24.598
In short, what I think
I need is a supercar.

17:24.920 --> 17:28.300
And there's none more capable
or more loaded with technology

17:28.400 --> 17:30.039
than the one I'm driving next.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.359
Welcome to the future.

17:57.600 --> 18:01.660
This is the 650S,
the latest creation from McLaren

18:01.760 --> 18:04.359
and a quantum leap
in terms of car design.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.820
Every inch of this technical marvel

18:07.920 --> 18:11.359
has been engineered
to make it go faster than its rivals.

18:13.680 --> 18:16.919
From the integrated
front splitter that creates downforce,

18:17.440 --> 18:21.799
to these unique door blades that help
generate incredible grip and balance.

18:24.240 --> 18:28.300
And then, there's the engine,
a twin-turbo V8 warp drive

18:28.400 --> 18:33.319
that propels the 650S to
a top speed of 207 miles per hour.

18:34.160 --> 18:36.639
Now, that really is
flying machine speed.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.060
Now, I'm fortunate enough to have driven

18:56.160 --> 18:58.799
well, nearly every
supercar in the modern era,

18:59.080 --> 19:03.479
from Bugatti to Ferrari, Aston Martin
to Lamborghini, all of them.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.540
And they all have one thing
very much in common,

19:06.640 --> 19:08.540
which is that they're
different to this McLaren,

19:08.640 --> 19:10.959
because this car is truly unique,

19:11.120 --> 19:14.359
in that it has liquid suspension,
and I'm not joking.

19:18.040 --> 19:22.700
It's got hydraulic fluid that rushes
across the suspension very, very quickly,

19:22.800 --> 19:26.439
and responds when you need to shore up
some support in a corner.

19:26.600 --> 19:30.879
And it's absolutely incredible to drive,
because it's so responsive.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.540
And if you're wondering where
this mythical technology comes from,

19:40.640 --> 19:42.639
well, of course,
it comes from Formula 1.

19:43.080 --> 19:46.199
McLaren have been involved
at the sharp end since the '60s,

19:47.040 --> 19:49.620
and a lot of the active
technology on this car

19:49.720 --> 19:52.740
was banned from Formula 1,
because it was an unfair advantage.

19:52.840 --> 19:57.140
But all is fair in love, war,
supercars and stunt sequences.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.119
So their loss is my gain.

20:02.560 --> 20:06.020
And the other good thing about
Formula 1 technology is that it's tough.

20:06.120 --> 20:09.439
This car is made from
a carbon fibre mono cell body

20:09.880 --> 20:11.660
that sits around
the driver like a cocoon.

20:11.760 --> 20:14.420
So it's fantastically
protective in a crash,

20:14.520 --> 20:17.180
as well as giving you
the support in the corners.

20:17.280 --> 20:21.359
Now, that should be good for taking
a bullet or five, if it comes to that.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.780
With this kind of technology,

20:24.880 --> 20:29.759
the 650S can accelerate to
60 miles per hour in 2.9 seconds,

20:30.200 --> 20:33.679
and come to a dead stop
in just under 29 meters.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.020
Now, some of those figures
are a little bit hard to comprehend,

20:39.120 --> 20:41.319
so what I need to do
is a practical experiment

20:41.440 --> 20:44.319
to show you just
how mind-blowing the McLaren really is.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.900
This is an Audi A4 S Line,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.140
the kind of car that typically
flashes you to get out of the way

20:49.240 --> 20:50.780
of the fast lane on a motorway.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.260
It's a tidy little car.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.700
What I'm gonna do
is accelerate from 0 to 60,

20:54.800 --> 20:56.959
and back to 0 as fast as I can,

20:57.120 --> 21:00.439
and I'll jump in the 650S
and we'll compare the difference.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.519
So, into sport mode.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.399
Off we go.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.839
Here we go it's 40, 50...

21:11.440 --> 21:14.280
And 60!

21:15.760 --> 21:18.340
Ah, pretty good for German engineering.

21:18.440 --> 21:19.999
Very impressive braking.

21:20.360 --> 21:23.399
Now, it's time to hop in
the McLaren and see the difference.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.620
Now, in the Audi, that launch

21:32.720 --> 21:35.780
was similar to a sort of
fast getaway from the traffic lights.

21:35.880 --> 21:39.100
But in the McLaren, when this launches,
its gonna be like a space shuttle.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.319
Apollo 13. No, Interstellar
is a better example.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.639
So, get it into D,
set the launch control on.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.759
Okay, so it's ready.
All I have to do is floor it.

21:49.880 --> 21:54.600
And the turbo spools up, it's ready,
and I just dump the brake and we're off!

21:56.760 --> 21:57.759
60.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.119
Oh, the braking, blimey.

22:00.560 --> 22:03.100
Literally, you're peeling
the back of your head off the chair,

22:03.200 --> 22:06.199
and the next thing is you're trying to
keep your nose off the dashboard.

22:06.360 --> 22:09.500
And the distance compared to the Audi,
this is half the space.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.479
0 to 60, back to naught
in hardly any space at all.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.439
The McLaren certainly
has the straight line speed

22:17.560 --> 22:19.279
to escape an aerial threat.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.359
But, does it have
the manoeuvrability I need as well?

22:25.800 --> 22:28.359
A striking feature of this car
is the aerodynamics.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.719
Of course, McLaren
calls it the Active Aero.

22:32.240 --> 22:35.759
Get on the brakes,
it pops up like a barn door,

22:35.920 --> 22:40.540
acting as an air brake and stabilising
the car with extra downforce

22:40.640 --> 22:44.559
to push the rear into the deck
and give you maximum braking force.

22:45.280 --> 22:50.039
It's like having an R2-D2 on your shoulder,
setting X Foils into attack position.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.639
Really incredible.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.719
And it gives you
the confidence to attack these corners.

23:07.320 --> 23:11.020
At the heart of this ship
is an ultra lightweight V8 engine,

23:11.120 --> 23:13.959
powered with two turbochargers.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.220
You just hear those
spooling up behind you,

23:16.320 --> 23:19.340
there's this beautiful whistling sound
when you lay down the power.

23:22.040 --> 23:27.079
This car only takes 5.7 seconds
to reach 100 miles an hour.

23:27.320 --> 23:29.159
It's ridiculously fast.

23:29.400 --> 23:33.559
The supercars of yesteryear
took that long to get from 0 to 60.

23:36.880 --> 23:42.940
That engine just keeps on pushing
this car all the way up to 207 miles an hour.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.799
So I love it.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.199
It seems to be almost unbreakable.

23:51.320 --> 23:54.260
Of course the question is,
will it be good enough for Barry?

23:54.360 --> 24:00.599
Well, stopping power is, well, unbelievable,
acceleration, yep, phenomenal.

24:01.280 --> 24:03.679
Handling-wise,
it's totally out of this world.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.140
I think the other thing to
think about is, uh, off road.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.999
Hmm, that could be interesting.

24:20.360 --> 24:23.540
Right, now, there's an off-road course
around here somewhere.

24:23.640 --> 24:27.999
Here we go. Bit of a ski jump.
Let's give this a try.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.860
Whoa, there's some nasty gravel.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.719
Don't want to chip the paint
on this baby.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.799
And I don't want
the dust going in the air intake either.

24:35.360 --> 24:38.599
The ride height on the McLaren
is not exactly high.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.959
There's a bit of a dip,
let's have a... Whoa!

24:44.800 --> 24:45.860
Well, that's enough.

24:45.960 --> 24:49.319
That's going to rip the splitter off.
Right, I can't get over that.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.780
As painful as it is to admit,

24:52.880 --> 24:57.100
the McLaren 650S may not be
the ideal tool for off-roading.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.279
So, I think this is going to
have to come off the menu.

25:04.560 --> 25:07.719
Sorry, baby,
let's get you back off here.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.599
What an amazing car.

25:17.920 --> 25:20.820
The McLaren is just
a feat of engineering and design.

25:20.920 --> 25:24.599
It's as good as anything I've ever driven
in terms of balance and performance.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.100
And if this chase sequence
was purely on the road,

25:27.200 --> 25:30.239
with no evasive manoeuvres
or hand brake turns,

25:30.440 --> 25:32.239
the 650S would be my choice.

25:32.440 --> 25:36.959
But I think I need something
with just a bit more all-round capability.

25:37.080 --> 25:39.180
In fact, I think if
I drove it up on to the set,

25:39.280 --> 25:42.119
Barry would probably kill me,
and then he'd steal the keys.

25:45.080 --> 25:49.119
The thing that is starting to nag me a bit,
though, is this aerial attack business.

25:49.280 --> 25:53.079
I really haven't got a clue
what I'm up against or how to evade it.

25:53.360 --> 25:56.380
I think I'm gonna have to do
some serious research.

26:15.600 --> 26:19.159
This is the Extra 300
aerobatic stunt plane.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.559
Powered by
a 300 brake horsepower engine,

26:25.920 --> 26:29.639
it has a top speed
in excess of 250 miles per hour.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.340
But it's the sheer manoeuvrability

26:35.440 --> 26:39.959
and handling of this thing that makes it
the F1 car of air race planes.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.919
And this one has been
fitted with two seats.

26:52.520 --> 26:55.039
I think you can probably
see where this is going.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.420
My wingman for the day

27:00.520 --> 27:03.679
is former RAF fast jet pilot
Mark Greenfield.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.679
With over 20 years of
aerobatics coaching under his belt,

27:07.840 --> 27:12.140
including a stint running the world-famous
Empire Test Pilot school,

27:12.240 --> 27:14.039
he's a real-life top gun.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.780
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready. Let's do it.

27:21.880 --> 27:23.119
Okay, power's coming on.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.199
So, that's us airborne.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.519
That did not take long, did it?

27:35.640 --> 27:36.919
No, not at all.

27:39.480 --> 27:43.519
Once airborne, Mark doesn't hesitate
to show me what the plane can do.

27:47.520 --> 27:48.559
Ah...

27:50.159 --> 27:52.239
I hate you already.

27:55.400 --> 27:58.279
Well, I admit I was, uh...

27:58.400 --> 28:01.959
Obviously the whole reason
of coming up here is to try and gauge

28:02.080 --> 28:05.239
how I'm going to fare in a car
against something in the air.

28:05.640 --> 28:08.919
And, uh, I'm not sure if I'm feeling
as confident after that.

28:11.920 --> 28:14.479
And things generally
got worse from there.

28:17.840 --> 28:18.839
Oh, my God.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.679
I don't know what just happened,
but I'm glad that it's over.

28:24.480 --> 28:27.959
I was starting to realise
I could be in serious trouble.

28:28.640 --> 28:32.300
But, the whole thing with a car is that
I can stop, whereas you can't.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.879
Well, it depends
what you mean by stopping.

28:35.160 --> 28:38.380
If you can brace yourself and
I'll show you how we'll stop

28:38.480 --> 28:40.439
relative to the ground in three seconds.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.439
I don't know if I'm gonna like this.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.759
Okay, so that's effectively
a right angle turn there.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.780
- Yeah
- And so, the movement

28:51.880 --> 28:55.879
over the ground was...
uh, pretty much 0.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.719
I just feel like
you've got a whole range of tools

29:00.880 --> 29:03.119
with which to punish me
while we're up here, and...

29:03.280 --> 29:06.559
I don't think that I did anything to you
in a former life to justify that.

29:08.920 --> 29:13.439
As it turned out, though,
Mark had been saving the best until last.

29:16.480 --> 29:19.660
The Cravat, a highly-dangerous
aerobatic manoeuvre

29:19.760 --> 29:21.980
which sends the plane into a wild spin,

29:22.080 --> 29:26.439
twisting around and around in the vertical
whilst tumbling at the same time.

29:29.560 --> 29:32.999
Okay, so, we're gonna pull up
gently into the vertical,

29:33.240 --> 29:35.159
and we're about to go direct...

29:47.520 --> 29:48.759
How was that?

29:49.200 --> 29:51.239
I think, what you've done there is,

29:52.040 --> 29:55.980
you've taken a boy's dream
and you've turned that into a nightmare.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.260
I have your best interests at heart,

29:58.360 --> 30:02.599
but I do want to make sure you understand
the capabilities of an aeroplane.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.039
Mark's demonstration has proven to me

30:11.160 --> 30:13.799
just how formidable
this aerial attack might be.

30:14.120 --> 30:17.140
If we reverse the roles,
and you had to choose a car

30:17.240 --> 30:19.340
to get away from an aeroplane,
what would you choose?

30:19.440 --> 30:22.540
Well, I'd want something that
is very manoeuvrable

30:22.640 --> 30:25.479
and very agile
and tight turning circle would be good.

30:25.720 --> 30:30.479
Lots of power and something that's
camouflaged to match its surroundings.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.740
Next, Mark decided to show me

30:33.840 --> 30:37.559
how devastating a strafing run
would be at 250 miles per hour.

30:38.080 --> 30:40.319
Here we go, rolling in.

30:41.520 --> 30:44.559
Wow, that's amazing,
when you see the ground open up like that.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.099
This is quite low!

31:00.840 --> 31:04.799
There's just no denying it.
A plane is faster, more agile

31:04.920 --> 31:07.599
and more lethal than
I could ever have imagined.

31:10.560 --> 31:14.599
If Mark had been hunting me in the plane,
I would have had nowhere to hide.

31:18.400 --> 31:19.420
Well, thank you very much.

31:19.520 --> 31:22.319
I think I've learned
all I need to know about...

31:22.440 --> 31:25.679
An acrobatic, aerobatic
wizard like yourself.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.900
So, I hope I never meet you again.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.879
Cos if you're working for the other
side, I'm in deep trouble.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.119
Oh...

31:34.720 --> 31:36.860
The ground is still moving
under my feet.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.340
- You're a horrible, horrible man.
- It might do that for a little while.

31:39.440 --> 31:42.839
Yeah, I'm not doing that again.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.319
You have one new message.

31:51.440 --> 31:56.319
Ben, I hired you to find me
a car, not a damn plane.

31:56.800 --> 32:01.180
Stop trying to second-guess me.
That just makes me angry.

32:01.280 --> 32:05.518
And trust me, you do not want that.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.799
As unpleasant as that experience was,

32:16.120 --> 32:19.519
it has given me some idea
of what I might be facing out there.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.959
But I need to get on with this
because the clock is ticking.

32:22.160 --> 32:25.159
And it's not helping me
with Barry's anger management issues.

32:26.360 --> 32:30.460
Now, the stunt plane has given me an idea
about the type of car I might want to choose.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.140
I've got one in mind now
for the underground scene

32:33.240 --> 32:36.599
that could fit the bill and just about
give my attackers the slip.

32:53.520 --> 32:58.620
It's 6:30 in the morning and, as instructed,
I've arrived on foot at this dockside,

32:58.720 --> 33:02.519
where, apparently,
I'll be met by someone, hopefully.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.580
And that someone is Michelle Westby,

33:19.680 --> 33:23.020
a Drift Cup Competitor,
and my guide into the world of drifting,

33:23.120 --> 33:25.679
the motorsport that's
taking the world by storm.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.460
- Hi, Michelle. That's mega.
- Hi.

33:29.560 --> 33:30.900
- Thank you.
- It's a great location...

33:31.000 --> 33:33.980
And great big space. It's just like
San Tropez, but with concrete.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.420
Beautiful location,
lovely smooth surface here...

33:36.520 --> 33:38.300
- Perfect for drifting.
- Excellent.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.460
I've got a first lesson for you as well.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.599
I'm gonna take you over now to meet
the British Drift Champions,

33:41.720 --> 33:43.660
and they're going to
give you quick crash course in drifting.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.479
- Beauty. Cool. Cool.
- Let's go.

34:05.800 --> 34:09.759
So, let me introduce you
to JapSpeed Drift Team and their drivers.

34:11.080 --> 34:13.139
First up, we have Paul "Smokey" Smith,

34:13.239 --> 34:16.020
Super Pro Drift British Champion of 2012

34:16.120 --> 34:18.559
and one of the hardest
competitors on the scene.

34:19.520 --> 34:21.079
Next up, we have Shane Lynch.

34:21.199 --> 34:23.739
Irishman Shane made the switch
from circuit racing

34:23.840 --> 34:26.998
to drifting in 2007 and
has not looked back since.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.860
So, what I've arranged for you
is for Smokey to let you know

34:30.960 --> 34:32.340
all you need to know about drifting.

34:32.440 --> 34:33.980
- Smashing.
- And then you'll be battling it out

34:34.080 --> 34:37.580
with Shane after, whilst me
and Smokey look on and judge a winner.

34:37.679 --> 34:38.958
Sweet, let's do it.

34:39.560 --> 34:40.599
- Smoke.
- All right.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.119
Lovely stuff, good to
meet you, yeah. Brilliant.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.699
Shane. Looks like a biter. So...

34:46.800 --> 34:49.139
But we will tangle later, me and you.

34:49.239 --> 34:51.599
Teach you some manners, boy. Oh, yeah.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.900
Although my day job involves
quite a lot of drifting,

35:05.000 --> 35:06.420
I've never done it competitively.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.920
So I need to know what
the judges are looking for.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.820
That's mega. And what kind of
things are you doing

35:13.920 --> 35:17.100
to sort of, like, unseat the other driver,
cos you're in attack mode.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.300
You're both in a tandem drift
and it's judged by a pair of judges.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.460
So what are they looking for?

35:21.560 --> 35:24.500
Well, they are looking for
general speed around the course.

35:24.600 --> 35:25.580
- It's not a race.
- Yeah.

35:25.680 --> 35:29.500
But they do like to see you going through
the course as fast as you possibly can.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.340
So speed is important,
so it's not all about sliding.

35:36.440 --> 35:37.740
It's not all about sliding.

35:37.840 --> 35:41.660
It's controlling the power
and getting that power to the ground...

35:41.760 --> 35:45.180
Yes, you're spinning the wheels, but you want
to be constantly moving forward.

35:48.280 --> 35:51.359
And what about Shane, then? Do you know
any tricks to making him uncomfortable?

35:51.760 --> 35:55.180
- If you go in and you're on his door...
- Yeah.

35:55.280 --> 35:59.260
...he'll know you mean business.
And I think that could take the win.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.100
- That's mega. Very cool.
- Yeah.

36:07.200 --> 36:11.140
Now, when I do this with Shane,
can I tap him out the way, knock him off?

36:11.240 --> 36:13.660
Don't crash into him,
judges don't like that...

36:13.760 --> 36:15.159
- But you can rub him...
- Is it against the rules?

36:15.280 --> 36:16.820
- Against the rules.
- It's not against my rules.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.380
I do it all the time on the track.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.540
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.300
All right, all right.
So, I have to do it fair and square,

36:21.400 --> 36:23.620
loads of grip, loads of speed
and try and intimidate him.

36:23.720 --> 36:26.420
Yeah, get as close as you can,
but don't hit him.

36:26.520 --> 36:27.799
All right.

36:28.400 --> 36:32.159
With the demonstration over,
it's time to take the wheel.

36:46.400 --> 36:49.839
Well, I don't know how many points
I'm going to get for style,

36:50.200 --> 36:52.439
but I'm just about
making it around this course.

36:53.280 --> 36:56.679
But I don't feel I'm doing it
quite as neatly as Smokey.

36:59.400 --> 37:02.199
Quayside, loads of toys.

37:09.760 --> 37:14.559
This car is just so drivable,
it's unreal.

37:16.760 --> 37:19.599
It feels like you can just
kick this thing anywhere.

37:23.240 --> 37:26.940
550 horsepower, it's just so precise.

37:30.480 --> 37:34.999
You can see why they tune these cars
so specifically for drifting.

37:35.280 --> 37:37.559
Everything is just perfectly tuned,

37:39.440 --> 37:40.999
but I can't stop sliding.

37:43.520 --> 37:47.119
This doesn't feel very fast,
but it does feel spectacular.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.399
Does feel like I could take it anywhere,

37:49.600 --> 37:51.919
maybe even under that truck,
give it a go.

37:56.280 --> 37:57.319
Impressive.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.039
This could be the baby.

38:02.120 --> 38:05.719
It's definitely the most fun car
I have ever driven, without a doubt.

38:06.480 --> 38:09.999
Loads of power, super precise, I'm sold.

38:14.440 --> 38:15.799
- Is that all right?
- That'll do.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.020
Let's take him on, man.
I'm gonna take Shane down the town.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.300
- I think you can do it.
- You reckon?

38:20.400 --> 38:21.799
- Yeah
- Really?

38:22.720 --> 38:24.540
I think it's different with
one than with two, isn't it?

38:24.640 --> 38:26.260
- Yeah, it's a little bit different.
- All right.

38:26.360 --> 38:27.700
- We'll see how you get on.
- Fair enough.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.980
- Where is he? That way?
- Over there.

38:30.080 --> 38:31.399
Mystery man.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.420
Guys. Shane, you're to lead.

38:48.520 --> 38:51.879
Ben, you must follow as close
to Shane's rear quarter as possible.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.759
Shane, you ready? Ben, you ready?

38:55.880 --> 38:57.439
Go!

39:19.560 --> 39:23.519
Just when our epic battle
was heating up, disaster struck.

39:24.080 --> 39:28.879
Shane's super charger on his
modified Nissan 370Z disintegrated,

39:29.400 --> 39:34.079
resulting in catastrophic engine failure,
bringing our competition to an end.

39:39.720 --> 39:44.740
It was just as well, really, because my
Silvia wasn't sounding too clever either.

39:53.360 --> 39:57.639
Broken the diff. Mind you,
my pain is not as bad as Shane's.

39:58.560 --> 40:02.519
This looks like a super charger belt,
another piece here.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.639
We could try and knit
this together, mate.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.399
That would make a lovely paperweight.

40:08.480 --> 40:10.500
Technically... What about that?

40:10.600 --> 40:11.599
That's default win, isn't it?

40:11.880 --> 40:13.740
- No.
- His breakage is worse than mine.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.300
- No.
- What do you mean "no"?

40:15.400 --> 40:16.959
Do these things really break this often?

40:17.120 --> 40:19.100
They do, unfortunately.
That's why we carry spares.

40:19.200 --> 40:20.940
Spares... What do you mean "spares"?

40:21.040 --> 40:22.919
Spares?

40:24.840 --> 40:28.160
Barry hasn't got time for spares.
Where's he going?

40:29.240 --> 40:33.820
These things are very unreliable, clearly.
And that's not gonna work well.

40:33.920 --> 40:36.260
They're also quite slow, because...

40:36.360 --> 40:38.420
It's great, their drifting,
they're amazing, they're spectacular

40:38.520 --> 40:40.700
but you're going sideways,
you're not going forwards that quickly.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.319
Top speed, 80 miles an hour...

40:42.640 --> 40:47.599
Where is he... Where am I supposed to go?
Broken car. I'll follow him.

40:55.240 --> 40:57.780
That came close, but no cigar.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.879
The drift car made all the right noises,

41:00.040 --> 41:02.519
but with that lack of
top speed and dodgy reliability,

41:02.880 --> 41:04.199
I'd just be dead meat.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.039
Adding some heat to the situation

41:09.320 --> 41:11.460
is the abusive messages
I'm getting on my phone

41:11.560 --> 41:13.620
from Barry, and the elephant in the room

41:13.720 --> 41:19.279
is the small matter of finding a car
that actually can go fast off-road.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.920
It's time to head west.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.140
Hidden deep within
a rural valley in mid-Wales

41:40.240 --> 41:43.679
lies over 10 miles
of demanding off-road track,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.540
a network of punishing gravel roads,

41:46.640 --> 41:49.719
which makes the perfect
testing ground for this...

41:53.880 --> 41:57.980
The Ariel Nomad, an insane creation
that wouldn't look out of place

41:58.080 --> 42:00.039
on the set of a Mad Max movie.

42:00.520 --> 42:03.500
Ten years in the making,
this is the latest offering

42:03.600 --> 42:05.700
from track day heroes, Ariel,

42:05.800 --> 42:09.260
famous for their road-based
rocket ship, the Atom.

42:09.360 --> 42:13.140
This machine is their idea
of what an off-road vehicle should be,

42:13.240 --> 42:15.319
and it might just fit the bill.

42:17.320 --> 42:21.220
Ariel will say that this car
will accelerate from 0 to 60 miles an hour

42:21.320 --> 42:23.439
in just 3.4 seconds.

42:23.560 --> 42:25.780
Now, that's Ferrari Enzo territory,

42:25.880 --> 42:30.759
and if that's the case, these baddy soldier
people are in for some serious trouble.

42:38.720 --> 42:39.719
That's first.

42:41.560 --> 42:45.079
And that's second,
and that's straight to 62 miles an hour.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.700
Like me, you're probably wondering
how the hell it does that.

42:49.800 --> 42:51.620
Well, it's not doing it
with brute force,

42:51.720 --> 42:55.700
because this engine
only pops out 235 horsepower,

42:55.800 --> 42:57.679
which is practically a lawnmower.

43:00.400 --> 43:03.559
Powered by a 2.4 litre Honda engine,

43:04.120 --> 43:06.420
and it doesn't have a
supercharger or a turbo.

43:06.520 --> 43:09.159
It's just good, old-fashioned torque.

43:12.080 --> 43:15.799
The beauty of it is in
the power-to-weight ratio,

43:15.920 --> 43:19.279
because the car
only weighs 570 kilograms,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.639
which is about half a Ford Focus.

43:26.640 --> 43:30.140
65% of that weight
is over the rear axle,

43:30.240 --> 43:33.759
where you need it for traction because
this is rear-wheel-drive only.

43:34.280 --> 43:36.999
I really thought that
would kill the steering,

43:37.440 --> 43:38.620
but it doesn't.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.140
This thing is so agile,

43:40.240 --> 43:43.279
and just fires you
out of these corners, it's ridiculous.

43:55.440 --> 43:59.740
Part of the grip story is from these
three-way adjustable dampers,

43:59.840 --> 44:01.820
and these amazing all-terrain tyres,

44:01.920 --> 44:05.079
that just eat the landscape
and spit it out the back.

44:05.920 --> 44:06.919
Whoo!

44:28.240 --> 44:30.980
It's almost easy to forget
why I came here in the first place,

44:31.080 --> 44:33.380
which is to assess whether this baby

44:33.480 --> 44:37.199
has got what it takes
to escape an aerial assault.

44:37.640 --> 44:41.940
In terms of sheer straight line speed,
136 miles an hour...

44:42.040 --> 44:44.100
Okay, it's not the
fastest thing in the world,

44:44.200 --> 44:48.319
but you could pretty much
drive over anything at 80 miles an hour.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.020
The thing that lets it down though,

44:51.120 --> 44:53.580
there's just nothing protecting
the car's vital parts.

44:53.680 --> 44:56.540
The engine is just covered
in the same plastic they use

44:56.640 --> 45:00.039
to build traffic cones.
It's hardly bulletproof.

45:00.400 --> 45:03.519
And I'm expecting some
serious flak from the sky.

45:06.760 --> 45:08.420
It's with a very heavy heart,

45:08.520 --> 45:10.340
but I'm gonna have to
say no to the Nomad.

45:10.440 --> 45:14.140
However, I've got one more supercar
from the off-road world

45:14.240 --> 45:16.159
that might just do the job.

45:17.560 --> 45:19.879
This, as you can
probably tell, is a Mini,

45:20.040 --> 45:23.700
but it couldn't be further away
from the run-of-mill estate agent chariot

45:23.800 --> 45:25.559
you see every day in the High Street.

45:27.280 --> 45:30.500
This one competes in
the World Rally Cross Championship,

45:30.600 --> 45:33.799
one of the roughest
and toughest race series on the planet.

45:38.920 --> 45:41.660
Okay, it's time to unleash
the fury of this baby.

45:41.760 --> 45:43.740
There's quite a complicated
launch procedure.

45:43.840 --> 45:46.380
I've got to hold of my
finger over the launch button.

45:46.480 --> 45:49.860
Okay, I've got first gear,
gonna turn the anti-lag on.

45:49.960 --> 45:52.460
There we go, I can already
feel the power surge.

45:52.560 --> 45:54.099
Here we go.

45:56.240 --> 45:59.159
Oh, my God, it's unbelievable power.

46:02.080 --> 46:04.860
The kick in the back you get
is like from a Formula 1 car,

46:04.960 --> 46:07.780
that does 0 to 60 in 2.5 seconds,

46:07.880 --> 46:11.100
up to 100 in five.
Absolutely ridiculous.

46:12.720 --> 46:16.540
This model was originally designed
for the World Rally Championship,

46:16.640 --> 46:21.239
but then they added an
enormous turbo so big...

46:21.880 --> 46:22.860
Whoa!

46:22.960 --> 46:24.420
...they had to give it a name.

46:24.520 --> 46:28.420
Its name is Gerrard,
and when Gerrard gets angry,

46:28.520 --> 46:30.119
you go very, very fast.

46:39.560 --> 46:42.260
It kicks out 500 horsepower,

46:42.360 --> 46:44.020
which is twice the Nomad had,

46:44.120 --> 46:46.679
lancing itself very neatly

46:47.400 --> 46:50.079
through this four-wheel-drive system,

46:50.400 --> 46:52.639
just hammering me down this road.

46:56.320 --> 46:57.319
Whoo!

46:59.960 --> 47:02.060
It's also got this wonderful handbrake,

47:02.160 --> 47:03.780
which has rear diff release,

47:03.880 --> 47:07.359
which I admit, sounds like some kind
of bowel control problem.

47:08.800 --> 47:10.140
What it allows me to do is

47:10.240 --> 47:12.620
lock up the rear wheels
whilst applying the power

47:12.720 --> 47:16.079
and just trim the nose
of the car into the corner

47:16.480 --> 47:19.439
whilst accelerating,
and it's just incredible.

47:22.640 --> 47:27.300
I'm very reassured by the fact that
this car is covered in Kevlar,

47:27.400 --> 47:29.879
the stuff they make
bulletproof jackets from.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.119
There's a whole shield
in front of the engine bay

47:33.000 --> 47:34.140
and in the rear quarter panels,

47:34.240 --> 47:38.279
so if I do come under fire,
I've got some pretty good protection there.

47:39.960 --> 47:44.340
I've got a good feeling about this Mini.
I think this is the one.

47:44.440 --> 47:48.439
Oh, hang on a minute.
Team are calling me in.

47:59.840 --> 48:02.140
That was awesome. Thank you so much.

48:02.240 --> 48:04.159
- Is everything okay?
- No, we need to refuel.

48:05.600 --> 48:07.759
What, did you half fill it or
something, or was that a full tank?

48:07.880 --> 48:09.540
- That is a full tank.
- You serious?

48:09.640 --> 48:10.639
I'm serious.

48:11.800 --> 48:14.319
Well, five minutes isn't going to cut
a car chase. There's no way.

48:14.560 --> 48:16.020
This car had everything I wanted,

48:16.120 --> 48:18.679
and now I've got to
start completely from scratch.

48:19.240 --> 48:20.239
Ugh!

48:31.160 --> 48:32.140
Hi, Barry.

48:32.240 --> 48:35.119
Ben, don't mention names
over a cellular phone!

48:35.680 --> 48:38.479
And you know why I'm calling.
Have you found me a car?

48:38.800 --> 48:40.220
Uh, no, not quite.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.879
What do you mean, "Not quite"?

48:43.240 --> 48:47.060
Well, I've tested some amazing stuff
but nothing that's quite right for the job.

48:47.160 --> 48:52.300
You really need to sort this.
Fourteen hours, find me that car!

48:52.400 --> 48:54.359
I will, I promise. I've got a plan.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.759
Barry... Hello?

48:58.560 --> 49:00.420
Bye... Bye, Barry.

49:00.520 --> 49:02.039
Thanks for calling.

49:21.960 --> 49:25.700
Here are the final four cars
I'm assessing for this mission.

49:25.800 --> 49:27.919
And to help me make the big decision,

49:29.200 --> 49:33.039
I've brought in stunt driving
heavyweight, Martin Ivanov,

49:34.080 --> 49:36.119
known as "the Russian."

49:38.400 --> 49:41.559
A multiple-award-winning stunt
performer and driver,

49:41.680 --> 49:43.660
we met on the set of Quantum of Solace,

49:43.760 --> 49:46.839
and he's the one man I trust
when it comes to a car chase.

49:49.240 --> 49:51.740
Martin, thanks for coming all the way from
Moscow to test these cars out.

49:51.840 --> 49:52.820
You know the brief.

49:52.920 --> 49:55.119
The first one we've got is the Audi S8,

49:55.440 --> 49:58.900
and it should be good because it's,
you know, a true action movie favourite.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.740
Yeah, perfect, this is the car.
No more searching needed.

50:01.840 --> 50:04.140
Okay, great, that's good confidence

50:04.240 --> 50:07.380
but we have got more in the car park,
so, this is just one of the four.

50:07.480 --> 50:09.319
No, no, no, no. This is the car.

50:11.080 --> 50:15.559
Now, to settle this argument,
we need to get out on the track.

50:23.680 --> 50:25.580
The amazing thing with this car
is when you get into it,

50:25.680 --> 50:29.999
it feels really big, it's like being
in a tank but it's so fast with it.

50:33.840 --> 50:37.159
It's got twin-turbocharged,
V8 engine, 520 horsepower.

50:39.680 --> 50:42.740
And because it's Quattro, I think
it's gonna be almost as good off-road

50:42.840 --> 50:44.460
as putting its power down on the tarmac.

50:44.560 --> 50:47.799
So I think you've got a point.
This could be a fantastic car.

50:51.800 --> 50:53.380
But we are gonna test some more cars

50:53.480 --> 50:56.340
because I still think
one of those ones in the garage

50:56.440 --> 50:57.740
could be better than this one.

50:57.840 --> 50:58.919
Yeah. Let's see.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.639
And here's the next contender.

51:13.360 --> 51:16.060
From super saloon to super car,

51:16.160 --> 51:18.679
this is the Noble M600.

51:20.760 --> 51:24.679
This could be a hero
or a villain's car with its mean looks.

51:26.520 --> 51:29.919
But this beast is all
about killer performance.

51:43.160 --> 51:46.940
Now, the reason I've chosen this Noble
is because it delivers true performance

51:47.040 --> 51:49.340
in a very, very simple old-fashioned way

51:49.440 --> 51:51.879
and I'm talking as basic
as horse and cart.

51:58.680 --> 52:02.740
It goes from 0 to 60 in three seconds,
and just keeps going

52:02.840 --> 52:05.519
until you get to 225 miles per hour,

52:05.960 --> 52:09.399
which surely is enough to defeat
anything by land, sea or air.

52:13.400 --> 52:17.580
I have to admit, aerodynamics are a
little bit light on the Noble,

52:17.680 --> 52:19.660
which does make it quite
skittish at high speed

52:19.760 --> 52:22.519
but it's also what makes it so fast.

52:25.280 --> 52:27.300
Just look what it's like in the corners.

52:27.400 --> 52:28.919
It's just balletic.

52:30.360 --> 52:33.319
And the harder you drive it,
the more you get out of it.

52:34.400 --> 52:36.599
I love this car.
I think this could be a winner.

52:40.600 --> 52:41.999
Release the Russian.

52:46.280 --> 52:47.279
I am coming.

52:57.040 --> 52:58.740
I almost feel sorry for Martin,

52:58.840 --> 53:01.220
in that I'm going to break his
spirit right at the beginning

53:01.320 --> 53:05.100
because the advantage this
car is pulling on the Audi is sizeable.

53:05.200 --> 53:06.239
It's killing it.

53:11.600 --> 53:15.199
The poise in these chicanes is where
I really seem to break away from him.

53:15.720 --> 53:20.940
Martin's car is leaning heavily,
blistering its front tyres no doubt,

53:21.040 --> 53:22.799
as it tries to keep up with the Noble.

53:25.960 --> 53:28.479
I'm sure he'll get over it
on his flight home.

53:29.440 --> 53:30.439
Bye-bye, Martin.

53:40.720 --> 53:43.359
Ugh! So much for
catching me, Martin. Where were you?

53:43.880 --> 53:44.879
This car is a joke.

53:45.280 --> 53:47.439
- What do you mean?
- Look at the ground clearance.

53:48.360 --> 53:49.340
It's not that low, is it?

53:49.440 --> 53:51.599
Your chase will end at first speed bump.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.820
Well, let's go try
another one then. Come on.

53:53.920 --> 53:55.399
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Grumpy.

54:03.720 --> 54:06.039
Next is the Jaguar F-Type.

54:09.240 --> 54:13.119
A stunning GT, which is giving
Aston Martin a run for its money.

54:15.480 --> 54:19.239
It certainly looks the part,
but does it have it where it counts?

54:31.800 --> 54:36.440
This is the Jaguar F-Type S,
a supercharged version of the V6 engine,

54:36.540 --> 54:39.980
knocking out 374 brake horsepower.

54:42.160 --> 54:44.879
It's got a shorter wheelbase
than that massive Audi,

54:45.000 --> 54:48.580
which should give this the advantage
in the off-road part of the chase,

54:48.680 --> 54:52.380
and it's got some ground clearance,
which was the Achilles heel for the Noble.

54:52.480 --> 54:54.759
So, this has got to be
a strong candidate.

55:03.560 --> 55:05.540
Now, unbelievably,
in terms of acceleration,

55:05.640 --> 55:08.559
the Audi actually has
the edge over this Jag,

55:08.720 --> 55:10.660
but this has longer legs,

55:10.760 --> 55:13.399
and it can stretch them
to 171 miles an hour.

55:14.360 --> 55:17.940
And it's great at drifting.

55:18.040 --> 55:22.759
Which means I can throw loads of smoke
in the face of my would-be pursuers.

55:25.320 --> 55:28.119
It's just so much fun, this car. Ahhh!

55:31.680 --> 55:33.039
Release the Russian.

55:41.680 --> 55:42.959
Come to papa.

55:46.760 --> 55:49.599
It's much, much more
evenly-matched this time.

55:52.200 --> 55:56.340
I've got a little bit more pick-up and
traction, just coming out of the corners

55:56.440 --> 56:00.199
but as soon as we get on these straights,
he is closing right up on me.

56:00.640 --> 56:02.079
This does not bode well.

56:04.520 --> 56:08.759
Let's try the old smoking-tyre manoeuvre
and see if I can push him back a little bit.

56:10.960 --> 56:12.340
Come on, Jag!

56:12.440 --> 56:15.660
I've got my foot to the floor.
I can't stop him.

56:15.760 --> 56:17.679
Ahhh, Martin!

56:24.800 --> 56:26.060
Oh, I thought you'd be smug.

56:26.160 --> 56:27.959
- Victory!
- I know what you're gonna say.

56:28.080 --> 56:30.519
I mean, you kind of won,
but only in the straight bit.

56:30.640 --> 56:33.759
- This is still a good car.
- But I won.

56:34.480 --> 56:37.719
- All right, well, I've got one more, yeah?
- Yeah, your last chance.

56:38.120 --> 56:39.279
Yeah, you're so tough.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.540
I've saved the best till last.

56:44.640 --> 56:48.479
The BMW M3 is a legend
of Teutonic performance.

56:48.720 --> 56:50.980
The M3 has been trouncing its rivals,

56:51.080 --> 56:54.500
on and off the race track,
for nearly four decades,

56:54.600 --> 56:57.119
but is it the all-rounder I need?

57:08.160 --> 57:13.540
Now this is BMW's brand new M3,
the pinnacle of German engineering,

57:13.640 --> 57:15.679
a car that even Martin would approve of.

57:18.920 --> 57:21.580
BMW have given this M3
a brand new engine.

57:21.680 --> 57:26.239
They ditched the V8 for a lighter
straight 6 turbocharged unit,

57:26.680 --> 57:29.860
firing out 425 horsepower.

57:29.960 --> 57:31.340
It's an incredible car to drive.

57:31.440 --> 57:33.599
You've got so much control
under your right foot.

57:36.480 --> 57:38.039
Fantastic cornering.

57:41.000 --> 57:45.719
And you can still drive it like
an absolute hooligan when you want to.

57:48.120 --> 57:49.679
This car is great.

57:54.200 --> 57:55.519
Deploy the Russian.

58:00.320 --> 58:03.439
You don't know the power of dark side.

58:06.320 --> 58:09.559
Now, instantly, I get the feeling
that we're much more closely-matched.

58:10.160 --> 58:13.599
Both these cars have got
incredible poise through the corners.

58:14.800 --> 58:18.519
He's hanging on, but it's nothing like
as deadly as it was with the Jag.

58:24.600 --> 58:28.820
Even in this big straight, the Audi,
I can just see him closing in.

58:28.920 --> 58:30.519
Argh! Braked a bit late.

58:32.560 --> 58:35.679
Oh, you're close, Martin,
but you're not quite close enough.

58:37.240 --> 58:38.239
Yeah.

58:42.040 --> 58:46.060
Well, that was a workout, but one
of these cars definitely is a winner,

58:46.160 --> 58:47.399
and I think I'm sitting in it.

58:52.240 --> 58:54.239
Well, I think that was draw, yes?

58:54.720 --> 58:56.159
I think even you'd agree with that.

58:56.840 --> 58:58.639
Well, hallelujah,
let's break out the champagne.

58:58.960 --> 59:00.319
I think this is the winner.

59:00.600 --> 59:01.599
No.

59:01.720 --> 59:02.719
Why?

59:03.080 --> 59:04.079
Look at the colour.

59:04.880 --> 59:07.239
Under aerial attack,
it's perfect target.

59:09.380 --> 59:11.499
Well, thanks. I'm not sure I agree.

59:12.280 --> 59:13.460
Well, I've got to pick something.

59:13.560 --> 59:15.900
If you had to pick
any car other than the Audi,

59:16.000 --> 59:17.119
which one would you pick?

59:17.320 --> 59:18.300
Audi.

59:18.400 --> 59:20.879
That's not helpful, is it?
Because I need to pick one.

59:21.560 --> 59:23.540
This is it, this is the final reckoning.

59:23.640 --> 59:27.279
I think I've made a decision, though,
which is it's got to be something else.

59:33.520 --> 59:34.500
Today is the day of reckoning.

59:34.600 --> 59:39.900
I really thought the BMW had it all,
but it just doesn't cover every base,

59:40.000 --> 59:43.220
and now I'm gonna go
with a car, in my gut,

59:43.320 --> 59:45.100
I'm convinced is the right one.

59:45.200 --> 59:46.679
No more second-guessing.

59:48.320 --> 59:49.319
Let's do this.

59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.759
My final choice is quite simply an icon,

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:04.959
a thoroughbred sports car
that's pure Hollywood.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:10.399
The Ford Mustang combines
European handling with American muscle,

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.999
making it the ultimate all-rounder,
and an unstoppable force.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.620
Rogue vehicle, rogue vehicle!

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.060
So there you have it, folks,
the Ford Mustang GT.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.220
Loads of grunt for getting
yourself out of trouble.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.100
It's got a clutch
and a handbrake for evasive measures,

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.420
ample space in the trunk for an RPG 7

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:11.239
and it's super fast off-road
as well as on it.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.999
I just hope the sequence
was enough to keep Barry... Oh!

01:05:14.305 --> 01:05:20.929
