WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.182
His partner didn't escape.
I let him go.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.532
I didn't see much point
in hanging onto him.

00:10.532 --> 00:11.924
The same way
there wasn't much point

00:12.055 --> 00:13.622
when I saw you this morning

00:13.796 --> 00:15.928
and telling me that two men
had tried to kidnap Teresa?

00:23.458 --> 00:26.243
Did someone get lost?

00:26.417 --> 00:27.331
Apparently so.

03:09.406 --> 03:12.104
Mmm.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.380
Huh?

11:29.166 --> 11:30.602
Psst!

12:02.809 --> 12:04.811
Anybody needs me,
I'll be in the pool.

12:04.811 --> 12:08.597
No, you won't.
Basam drained all the water out.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.164
- What?
- He's out there right now

12:10.164 --> 12:12.209
scrubbing the plaster
with some smelly chemical.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.863
What the hell for?

12:13.863 --> 12:17.258
Something about
dead bodies and bad juju.

12:20.304 --> 12:21.697
Hi.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.525
Good morning, Henri.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.440
Can I fix you
some breakfast?

12:25.440 --> 12:30.053
No, no, no, thank you.
I'm just retracing my steps.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.578
- I lost my notebook.
- You mean the little black book

12:33.578 --> 12:35.363
with the names of
all your girlfriends?

12:35.363 --> 12:37.887
It's brown.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.497
Do you remember
the last time you had it?

12:39.497 --> 12:42.587
The other day when
the body was, you know--

12:42.587 --> 12:44.328
Fucking up my pool.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.896
- Have you seen it?
- No.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.724
Did you write
your name inside?

12:48.724 --> 12:51.683
No.
- Next time you really should.

12:51.683 --> 12:54.904
Yes, good idea. I will.

12:54.904 --> 12:58.038
You know, I can write
your name in for you...

12:58.038 --> 13:02.999
since your handwriting
is a bit slipshod.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.306
Really? You'd do that?

13:05.306 --> 13:06.524
Of course.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.091
How about later
we go into town,

13:08.091 --> 13:10.006
and I'll help you
pick out a new one?

13:10.006 --> 13:12.356
- That sounds lovely.
- Okay, how about the two of you

13:12.356 --> 13:15.316
get the fuck out of here
before I chuck my breakfast?

13:15.316 --> 13:18.623
Someone's in a mood because they
can't swim in their <i>piscine.</i>

13:18.623 --> 13:22.105
Bye-bye. <i>Au revoir.
A bientôt.</i>

13:22.105 --> 13:24.194
Let me just go up and change.

13:24.194 --> 13:27.589
I certainly can't go
in my pajamas, can I?

13:39.209 --> 13:41.168
Just wait here.
I'll be two minutes.

13:41.168 --> 13:42.560
Great.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.954
Yeah. I already know
what I'm gonna wear.

13:46.347 --> 13:47.957
I can't wait.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.792
It's not <i>her</i>
I'm worried about.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.711
If only that were enough.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.343
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

14:27.388 --> 14:29.042
<i>- Merci.
- Merci.</i>

17:18.646 --> 17:19.951
<i>Oui.</i>

20:31.491 --> 20:33.928
Patrice.
It's Spade.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.364
I found the kid.

20:35.364 --> 20:37.192
Don't ask me how.

20:40.064 --> 20:42.893
You got a pen?
Write this down.

20:42.893 --> 20:45.113
Just past
the abandoned train station,

20:45.113 --> 20:47.637
there's that dirt track
that goes into the woods.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.945
Take the car as far as you can

20:50.945 --> 20:53.295
and then walk to the lake.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.471
I'll meet you at the boat ramp.

20:57.865 --> 21:02.043
Oh, and, uh,
Patrice, bring a gun.

21:02.043 --> 21:04.350
Philippe could be
somewhere hiding.

22:41.751 --> 22:43.797
Oh, dear.

22:43.797 --> 22:46.321
Well, this is
indeed embarrassing.

22:46.321 --> 22:47.975
I saw two of you
in the car.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.629
You thought you did.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.370
We only pretend
to be idiots.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.806
You do a great job.

22:52.806 --> 22:55.504
Still,
you had your suspicions.

22:55.504 --> 22:57.158
I had my somethings.

22:57.158 --> 22:59.943
So, what are you--
MI5, MI6?

22:59.943 --> 23:01.641
Tomato, to-mah-to.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.774
So...

23:04.774 --> 23:06.515
You mind
putting that down?

23:06.515 --> 23:08.343
Hmm. Sorry.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.435
So...

23:13.435 --> 23:15.916
just to clarify,

23:15.916 --> 23:18.440
you move in next door,
you bug my house.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.877
I'm guessing you're not
trying to steal the secrets

23:20.877 --> 23:22.313
to my superb wine.

23:22.313 --> 23:25.012
- Mildly superb, I'm afraid.
- Philippe?

23:25.012 --> 23:26.927
He's not all that superb
either.

23:26.927 --> 23:29.495
The kid?
Getting warmer.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.540
Why would I know
anything about him?

23:31.540 --> 23:33.499
- Colder.
- Teresa?

23:33.499 --> 23:35.152
Ding, ding, ding.

23:35.152 --> 23:37.024
Why would she know
anything about him?

23:37.024 --> 23:40.462
Our work relies less on
knowledge than proximity.

23:46.076 --> 23:47.600
Sister Angelique?

23:47.600 --> 23:49.079
Imagine our surprise.

23:49.079 --> 23:51.038
We follow one of
the kidnappers to a convent.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.866
She doesn't have
the child in question.

23:52.866 --> 23:56.391
Isn't actually a nun.
So what is she doing there?

23:56.391 --> 23:58.045
Communing with Jesus?

23:58.045 --> 24:00.221
Taking a well-earned
break from fornicating?

24:00.221 --> 24:02.876
Waiting. Watching.

24:02.876 --> 24:05.618
Doing what we would
do in her situation.

24:05.618 --> 24:08.359
But, again, why there?

24:08.359 --> 24:10.492
So we look at
who's in residence.

24:10.492 --> 24:12.189
We start
with the good sisters.

24:12.189 --> 24:13.930
But outside
the Mother Superior,

24:13.930 --> 24:17.586
whom, I must admit, has a rather
colorful background for a nun...

24:17.586 --> 24:19.283
You haven't met some
of the nuns I have.

24:19.283 --> 24:20.894
Alas, none of them
revealed any connection

24:20.894 --> 24:22.548
to our Algerian wayfarer.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.811
So next
we look at the children.

24:24.811 --> 24:28.467
And we discover one young lass
who's a bit different

24:28.467 --> 24:30.381
- from the others.
- That's an understatement.

24:30.381 --> 24:33.123
One young lass whose
mother was an American,

24:33.123 --> 24:35.561
a convicted murderer
and antiquities thief,

24:35.561 --> 24:37.171
and whose father
is an officer

24:37.171 --> 24:39.086
in the French Army
intelligence service

24:39.086 --> 24:41.436
and just so happens to be--Fucking sociopath.

24:41.436 --> 24:42.959
The other kidnapper.

24:42.959 --> 24:45.048
Oh, sure. That, too.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.703
Naturally, we became
very interested in her.

24:47.703 --> 24:48.922
You wanna recruit her,

24:48.922 --> 24:50.445
I'm sure she'd jump
at the chance.

24:50.445 --> 24:51.838
As well
as the shadowy man

24:51.838 --> 24:54.144
we observed delivering
envelopes full of cash

24:54.144 --> 24:55.450
to the convent each week.

24:55.450 --> 24:57.147
Nothing shadowy about it.

24:57.147 --> 24:59.019
I was just doing what
I was paid to do,

24:59.019 --> 25:02.936
which is to make sure that
young lass was taken care of.

25:02.936 --> 25:05.634
A little above and beyond,
don't you think?

25:05.634 --> 25:08.245
Or is your karmic debt
really that substantial?

25:08.245 --> 25:10.073
<i>You're</i> the spy.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.075
Let's just say your time
in San Francisco

25:12.075 --> 25:14.556
made for its own
colorful reading.

25:14.556 --> 25:17.646
Then you'll know that I
don't want any part of this.

25:17.646 --> 25:19.996
A little late for that,
don't you think?

25:19.996 --> 25:23.565
In my experience, a little late
usually refers to a lot dead.

25:23.565 --> 25:26.307
So no,
I'm happy to step aside.

25:26.307 --> 25:28.178
Well,
as they say in Hackney,

25:28.178 --> 25:30.746
in for a penny,
in for a pound of flesh.

25:30.746 --> 25:33.314
The flesh in this case
being the boy.

25:33.314 --> 25:35.316
You've seen his work,
I presume?

25:35.316 --> 25:36.622
The numbers.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.101
Is that all you think
they are?

25:38.101 --> 25:39.494
I don't care what they are,

25:39.494 --> 25:41.322
not after I come home
and find a dead soldier

25:41.322 --> 25:42.541
clogging my pool filter.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.630
And somehow
the problem found you.

25:44.630 --> 25:47.850
And now I want it
to lose me.

25:47.850 --> 25:52.115
I want you and Mummy to stop
popping up in the vineyard.

25:52.115 --> 25:54.378
And I want Teresa left alone

25:54.378 --> 25:57.860
before she gets shot
by someone's bad aim.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.340
Understood?

25:59.340 --> 26:00.950
You are being
exceptionally clear.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.691
Good. Very good.

26:02.691 --> 26:06.477
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm going for a swim.

26:13.702 --> 26:15.182
I gathered from all that
"okay, good, very good"

26:15.182 --> 26:16.836
that you grasped
your current situation.

26:16.836 --> 26:20.230
That is the second time
in two days

26:20.230 --> 26:22.537
that some fucking asshole

26:22.537 --> 26:24.191
got the drop on me.

26:24.191 --> 26:26.410
"The drop."
So bloody colorful.

26:26.410 --> 26:27.803
That was tae kwon do.

26:27.803 --> 26:29.588
I spent some time
in Korea, the North.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.591
Okay, well done...
I guess.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.854
Hm!

26:34.854 --> 26:37.421
What's your rush,
dear fellow?

26:37.421 --> 26:39.946
Join us for tea,
won't you?

28:02.550 --> 28:04.030
Mr. Spade?

28:37.019 --> 28:39.630
The nanny snuck off with
the boy three years ago.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.328
She worked for
an Egyptian family

28:41.328 --> 28:43.025
whenever
they'd visit Algeria.

28:43.025 --> 28:46.420
Mind you, this is a very
large, very wealthy family,

28:46.420 --> 28:48.639
with business interests
around the world,

28:48.639 --> 28:51.904
and yet there has been
not a noise, nor a sound,

28:51.904 --> 28:55.211
nor hint from them about one of
their children being abducted.

28:55.211 --> 28:58.345
- Maybe he wasn't one of theirs.
- He wasn't.

28:58.345 --> 28:59.781
From what we can glean,
the boy had been passed around

28:59.781 --> 29:01.043
from one high-ranking
family to another,

29:01.043 --> 29:02.653
since the day he was born.

29:02.653 --> 29:05.482
Two years ago, we received
word out of Tunisia

29:05.482 --> 29:07.136
that an Algerian woman
was attempting

29:07.136 --> 29:10.139
to sell a child
of great import. Digestive?

29:10.139 --> 29:13.795
An adoption was arranged in
Britain with a Saudi national,

29:13.795 --> 29:15.623
but something went amiss.

29:15.623 --> 29:19.192
The woman never showed up,
and the child disappeared again.

29:19.192 --> 29:21.237
A full year would pass
before there was

29:21.237 --> 29:22.978
another sighting of him--
this time in Algeria.

29:22.978 --> 29:25.154
No better place to hide
than in the middle of a war.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.677
Which meant
the stakes had risen

29:26.677 --> 29:29.463
to an entirely
new level of intensity.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.646
I know her.

29:38.646 --> 29:40.822
You knew her sister--

29:40.822 --> 29:45.348
the nanny, Angelique, the woman
pretending to be a nun.

29:45.348 --> 29:47.742
This woman goes by Gazala.

29:47.742 --> 29:49.831
- The uniform?
- FLN.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.659
She's fairly high up
the chain in the rebel army.

29:51.659 --> 29:54.140
We think the kidnapping
was her idea.

29:54.140 --> 29:55.881
We're not exactly certain why.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.447
Perhaps to raise money
for her comrades,

29:57.447 --> 29:59.667
or in exchange for some POWs.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.495
Why would the French
agree to that?

30:01.495 --> 30:03.758
Because they want the boy
as badly as everyone else.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.760
Because
of the numbers thing?

30:07.849 --> 30:09.242
Well, we have come to

30:09.242 --> 30:12.723
the proverbial fork
in the road, Mr. Spade.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.464
- Have we?
- Yes.

30:14.464 --> 30:18.077
Whether to reveal
all that we know...

30:19.165 --> 30:21.602
...or simply finish our tea.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.430
Meaning...

30:23.430 --> 30:26.085
can we trust you?

30:26.085 --> 30:28.914
As far as it goes, and with
the usual provisos and caveats,

30:28.914 --> 30:30.741
but you know that.

30:32.091 --> 30:36.356
Simply put,
the boy can break codes.

30:36.356 --> 30:40.055
Any code, instantly.

30:40.055 --> 30:43.363
He's also able to create
his own unique cryptograms,

30:43.363 --> 30:45.669
what you call "scribblings."

30:45.669 --> 30:47.497
Now I'm calling it bullshit.

30:47.497 --> 30:49.848
Not according to Tzedek,
the CIA, the KGB,

30:49.848 --> 30:51.893
and, of course, our chief,
back in London.

30:51.893 --> 30:53.939
- You left out the Church.
- Hm, which one?

30:53.939 --> 30:55.897
Name a religion,
they all want the child.

30:55.897 --> 30:58.900
- Start with Rome.
- Yeah, those wretched cardinals.

30:58.900 --> 31:01.860
They believe Zayd can prove the
existence of God mathematically,

31:01.860 --> 31:03.949
and they would,
of course, prefer their god

31:03.949 --> 31:05.646
to be the one the lad's
numbers add up to.

31:05.646 --> 31:08.779
- You don't say.
- Some Shiite scholars...

31:08.779 --> 31:11.173
have come to the conclusion
that the boy is

31:11.173 --> 31:13.915
the Mahdi,
a spirit close to Allah,

31:13.915 --> 31:17.745
who can disappear and
reappear whenever he chooses.

31:17.745 --> 31:19.747
Evidently, this
particular Mahdi's arrival

31:19.747 --> 31:23.533
could announce
the end of times.

31:23.533 --> 31:25.405
Of course, the Sunni ulamas

31:25.405 --> 31:26.667
believe the child
has come to Earth

31:26.667 --> 31:28.495
to restore
the purity of the faith.

31:28.495 --> 31:30.758
And whilst we all
wish him good luck,

31:30.758 --> 31:33.630
we're fearful some
in the FLN plan to murder him.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.763
Not particularly
religious, I guess.

31:35.763 --> 31:37.199
No. For the FLN,

31:37.199 --> 31:38.897
a martyr of any stripe
could come in handy.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.333
Nothing like getting
everyone's anger

31:40.333 --> 31:42.117
pointed
in the same direction.

31:42.117 --> 31:44.424
Exactly, and until now,
there've been so many factions

31:44.424 --> 31:46.774
shooting at one another,
including the OAS in the middle,

31:46.774 --> 31:50.299
shooting at everybody,
that some sort of
divine casualty

31:50.299 --> 31:53.128
could unify the country
faster than any bullet.

31:53.128 --> 31:55.522
The fact is, Mr. Spade,

31:55.522 --> 31:57.437
that whatever gifts
this child may possess

31:57.437 --> 32:00.614
can be used as evidence
that he may very well be the one

32:00.614 --> 32:02.616
for whom
so many have waited.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.923
"May very well be"
is a long way from "is."

32:04.923 --> 32:07.229
Why would anyone
believe this hokum?

32:07.229 --> 32:09.840
I mean, the world's gullible,
but not that gullible.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.538
Many thousands of years

32:11.538 --> 32:13.583
of human history
to the contrary,

32:13.583 --> 32:16.151
or perhaps I've missed
the moment when humans began

32:16.151 --> 32:19.024
parsing the difference
between knowing and believing.

32:19.024 --> 32:22.375
Neither of which are
necessary when creating a myth,

32:22.375 --> 32:23.593
which is exactly what some
Algerians hope

32:23.593 --> 32:24.899
to create around this child,

32:24.899 --> 32:26.553
one that could,
amongst other things,

32:26.553 --> 32:28.337
thwart Morocco's border grab
to the West.

32:28.337 --> 32:29.948
So far, I've heard
a lot about Sunnis,

32:29.948 --> 32:32.820
and Shiites, and Moroccans,

32:32.820 --> 32:36.650
but neither of you have
mentioned Philippe Saint-Andre.

32:36.650 --> 32:40.306
How has he found his way
into the middle of all this?

32:40.306 --> 32:43.091
That one's easy. Her.

32:43.091 --> 32:46.399
I imagine Sergeant Saint-Andre
forgot all about his orders

32:46.399 --> 32:48.444
to terminate
a high-level FLN assassin,

32:48.444 --> 32:53.014
when he saw this beautiful
face in his crosshairs.

32:53.014 --> 32:54.450
Aren't you forgetting
that the one thing

32:54.450 --> 32:56.191
Philippe Saint-Andre
loves more

32:56.191 --> 32:58.280
than a beautiful face is money?

32:58.280 --> 33:01.196
Most assuredly, the
FLN are paying him very well.

33:01.196 --> 33:03.329
Oh, I'm sure they think
they are, but if I'm Philippe

33:03.329 --> 33:05.679
and I know that this kid is
on the top of the wish list

33:05.679 --> 33:07.898
for every rebel,
spook, and priest,

33:07.898 --> 33:10.336
I'm thinking it's
a seller's market.

33:10.336 --> 33:11.815
I can make a lot more

33:11.815 --> 33:13.469
by offloading him
to the highest bidder.

33:13.469 --> 33:15.123
And that's what's happening.

33:15.123 --> 33:17.691
Of course, he has
the problem with Gazala.

33:17.691 --> 33:20.737
Again, if I'm Philippe,
a bullet solves that problem.

33:20.737 --> 33:22.000
Not this time.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.393
No one has actually
seen the child.

33:24.393 --> 33:26.482
No photos of him exist.

33:26.482 --> 33:29.833
Gazala is the only one who
can authenticate his identity

33:29.833 --> 33:31.531
to a potential buyer.

33:31.531 --> 33:34.882
So Philippe needs her.

33:34.882 --> 33:37.406
One assumes that each believes

33:37.406 --> 33:38.973
they have a deal with the other,

33:38.973 --> 33:40.409
and one can also assume

33:40.409 --> 33:42.324
that each has a plan
to kill the other

33:42.324 --> 33:43.804
once the deed is done.

33:43.804 --> 33:46.024
Either way, you can
understand our urgency

33:46.024 --> 33:49.375
behind removing
this child from such danger.

33:49.375 --> 33:52.247
Sure, so he can
break codes for you

33:52.247 --> 33:54.119
instead of anyone else.

33:56.512 --> 33:58.645
Tomato, to-mah-to.

34:01.561 --> 34:06.131
Well, this has all
been very enlightening.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.220
I'm afraid
we can't let you go.

34:08.220 --> 34:10.135
I wasn't asking
for permission.

34:10.135 --> 34:14.269
My dear Mr. Spade, please,
don't take offense,

34:14.269 --> 34:17.229
but despite
your stellar past,

34:17.229 --> 34:18.926
these many years in Bozouls

34:18.926 --> 34:21.972
have left you both
impetuous and clumsy.

34:21.972 --> 34:25.541
Therefore, we cannot
allow you to jeopardize

34:25.541 --> 34:28.936
what has been over two years
of meticulous tradecraft.

34:28.936 --> 34:31.634
And I can't allow you
to...

34:31.634 --> 34:34.028
The "Kato" thing
worked once.

34:37.292 --> 34:40.817
I propose
a relationship.

34:58.531 --> 35:00.837
Hold that thought.

35:09.759 --> 35:11.631
Okay, don't be mad.
We need to--

35:11.631 --> 35:13.111
- Are they moving?
- What?

35:13.111 --> 35:15.548
Are they pointing a gun,
anything like that?

35:15.548 --> 35:17.593
No, they're just
standing there.

35:17.593 --> 35:18.638
Good.

35:18.638 --> 35:20.727
I'll drive.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.772
Don't pout.

35:23.773 --> 35:27.342
That George guy, does he
look like he knows kung fu?

35:27.342 --> 35:28.909
Kung fu?

35:28.909 --> 35:30.476
- No.
- Yeah.

35:32.434 --> 35:34.175
I didn't think so either.

35:35.263 --> 35:37.178
That little bitch.

35:54.935 --> 35:56.415
Hmm?

37:13.492 --> 37:15.407
Marguerite?

38:51.503 --> 38:52.765
Mm.

44:39.764 --> 44:41.461
What's in there?

44:41.461 --> 44:43.942
Nothing.
The place is empty.

44:43.942 --> 44:46.292
But Claude said--It's a dead end.

45:00.959 --> 45:02.874
Should we get a drink?

45:05.267 --> 45:06.486
Really?

45:06.486 --> 45:08.575
Just one,
a very small one.

45:08.575 --> 45:10.098
We're going
to a bar?

45:10.098 --> 45:11.970
That's where
the drinks are.

45:11.970 --> 45:14.059
- Can I smoke?
- No.

45:14.059 --> 45:16.148
Can I drive?
Definitely not.

46:06.981 --> 46:10.158
I gotta figure out
what to do with her.

46:10.158 --> 46:12.682
The convent's not opening
anytime soon,

46:12.682 --> 46:14.597
and she doesn't want
to go back, anyway.

46:14.597 --> 46:16.861
But if you could, that's
where you would leave her?

46:16.861 --> 46:18.732
At the convent?

46:18.732 --> 46:20.255
Where else is there?

46:20.255 --> 46:23.389
How could someone
so smart be so stupid?

46:23.389 --> 46:25.913
She doesn't belong
anywhere but with you.

46:25.913 --> 46:27.915
Me?
No, she hates me.

46:27.915 --> 46:31.092
Maybe because you left her
at a convent.

46:31.092 --> 46:34.400
I was looking for advice,
not a lecture.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.837
But you need a lecture.

46:36.837 --> 46:39.144
You know exactly
what to do with her,

46:39.144 --> 46:41.059
you just
don't want to...

46:42.277 --> 46:44.279
What is the expression?

46:44.279 --> 46:46.064
Own up to it.

46:46.064 --> 46:48.501
- Own up to what?
- To the obvious.

46:48.501 --> 46:50.851
The thing you avoid
talking about.

46:50.851 --> 46:53.506
You know, you sound like
a gal I knew back in 'Frisco

46:53.506 --> 46:55.595
who talked
in a loop-de-loop.

46:55.595 --> 46:58.772
She'd never say a color was red,
only that it wasn't blue.

46:58.772 --> 47:01.166
Why don't you just say
what you want to say?

47:01.166 --> 47:04.430
I am. I have been.
For years now.

47:04.430 --> 47:06.562
Each time,
you suddenly go deaf.

47:14.353 --> 47:17.399
You're not the one who has to
clean the puke out of the car.

47:17.399 --> 47:19.706
Samuel knows how
to put a drop of gin

47:19.706 --> 47:21.926
in a tall glass
of tonic.

47:21.926 --> 47:23.231
Maybe she should
stay with you.

47:23.231 --> 47:25.538
You seem to
understand her so well.

47:30.108 --> 47:32.675
Okay, let's pretend
you really are an idiot,

47:32.675 --> 47:35.287
and I will put this
in your own words.

47:35.287 --> 47:38.507
Many years ago, Bridget
walks out of prison

47:38.507 --> 47:40.335
and into
your loving arms.

47:40.335 --> 47:45.123
You whisk her off to a motel
and fuck her one last time,

47:45.123 --> 47:47.386
only to realize
that the love,

47:47.386 --> 47:50.345
or whatever you two shared,
was all gone.

47:50.345 --> 47:53.740
And before you can tell her,
she's run off to Turkey,

47:53.740 --> 47:55.350
where she meets
Philippe,

47:55.350 --> 47:58.049
and you never
see her again.

47:58.049 --> 48:00.312
That's the story, yes?

48:00.312 --> 48:01.704
Yes.

48:01.704 --> 48:05.012
But where
in that epic tale

48:05.012 --> 48:07.319
do you hear
that I'm a father?

48:07.319 --> 48:10.148
Hm, so we are not
so dumb after all.

48:10.148 --> 48:13.064
You honestly think
that's never occurred to me?

48:13.064 --> 48:15.501
My point is only that
you won't face reality.

48:15.501 --> 48:18.460
I won't, because reality
doesn't make any sense.

48:18.460 --> 48:20.158
Why not?

48:20.158 --> 48:23.291
Teresa was 4 years old
when I picked her up in Turkey.

48:23.291 --> 48:24.510
So?

48:24.510 --> 48:26.816
I hadn't seen Bridget
in six years.

48:26.816 --> 48:28.514
And can you
make the difference

48:28.514 --> 48:30.995
between a 4-year-old
and a 6-year-old?

48:30.995 --> 48:33.214
I can read
a birth certificate.

48:33.214 --> 48:34.912
Bridget sounds
like someone

48:34.912 --> 48:37.349
who knew how to get
a document forged.

48:47.054 --> 48:48.534
Look at her.

48:49.665 --> 48:52.016
Does she seem 14
to you?

48:52.016 --> 48:54.105
She's 15.

48:54.105 --> 48:56.542
Does she seem 15
to you?

48:56.542 --> 48:58.936
Yeah.

48:58.936 --> 49:01.286
15 going on 50.

49:01.286 --> 49:03.070
Exactly.

49:03.070 --> 49:05.420
Look at her.

50:25.239 --> 50:26.719
Okay.

52:59.828 --> 53:01.265
♪ Knock it off.

53:01.395 --> 53:02.614
I'm already in a foul mood.

53:02.744 --> 53:04.137
Let's not make it any worse.

53:06.270 --> 53:09.969
I'm a private investigator
in Bozouls to find Zayd.

53:10.143 --> 53:11.753
Get in line.
Zayd?

53:11.927 --> 53:14.756
I'm not what you think I am,
Monsieur Spade.

53:14.887 --> 53:17.977
I can't imagine that a man
of your particular origins

53:18.107 --> 53:19.848
is upset about body count.

53:19.979 --> 53:23.025
I make decisions
and I live by them.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.636
For better or for worse.
