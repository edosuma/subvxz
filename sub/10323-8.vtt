Previously on
My Name Is Earl.

00:05.506 --> 00:10.511
In a world where friends
are hard to find
and even harder to keep,

00:10.578 --> 00:14.115
and even harder than that
to keep if you can find them,

00:14.182 --> 00:17.051
there was an innocent
mustached prisoner,

00:17.118 --> 00:19.553
his unmustached guard brother,

00:19.620 --> 00:23.857
locked in
a no-holds-barred battle
to decide who's in charge.

00:23.924 --> 00:27.595
Face it, Randy, you only took
this job 'cause you couldn't
exist out there without me.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.131
Or maybe I knew you couldn't
exist in here without me.

00:30.198 --> 00:33.467
Or maybe you're
gettin' defensive and sayin'
everything I say back at me.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.170
Or maybe you're just sayin'
what I'm gonna say
before I say it.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.506
What?
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

00:38.572 --> 00:42.510
[ Announcer ]
And a pregnant ex-wife
who will stop at nothing...

00:42.576 --> 00:46.514
to get her sister's
surrogated biracial baby
out of her womb.

00:49.016 --> 00:52.986
Now a renegade criminal
is on the loose
with nothing to lose.

00:53.053 --> 00:58.459
And an angry warden
must answer to himself
and his governor wife.

00:58.526 --> 01:01.829
I know what I'm doing.
I'm a grown man!
[ Grunts ]

01:01.895 --> 01:04.898
[ Announcer ]
Now, in order
to protect his job,

01:04.965 --> 01:09.170
the warden must find someone
just crazy enough
to attempt the impossible.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.038
Because you're both
gonna go out there,

01:11.105 --> 01:13.974
you're gonna get Frank
and you're gonna bring
him back here!

01:14.041 --> 01:17.445
[ Announcer ]
A secret mission that
no one can find out about.

01:17.511 --> 01:21.882
No troopers, no press.
And the governor can never
hear about this.

01:21.949 --> 01:25.018
[ Announcer ]
A difficult mission
made mission impossible.

01:25.085 --> 01:29.190
- Before we go, which one
of us is in charge?
- Would you two figure it out?

01:29.257 --> 01:31.492
[ Announcer ]
Two feuding brothers,

01:31.559 --> 01:34.828
one escaped convict,
zero chances to fail.

01:42.903 --> 01:46.174
Damn it, Randy,
the warden's my best chance
of gettin' out of here early.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.376
Why would you take a bunch
of convicts for ice cream?

01:48.442 --> 01:50.778
They get ice cream
in the prison cafeteria.

01:50.844 --> 01:55.216
I didn't want 'em to taste
the ice cream, Earl. I wanted
'em to taste the freedom.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.651
Okay, look,
we have 46 hours.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.988
Frank couldn't
have gotten that far.
Where's the ice cream store?

02:01.054 --> 02:04.758
It's the one next to the train
station and that costume store,

02:04.825 --> 02:06.894
near the bong shop where
they make the fake I.D.'s.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.364
We just have to look
for a guy who could be
dressed as anything...

02:10.431 --> 02:12.833
and who's anywhere
a train might go.

02:16.970 --> 02:21.108
Last Tuesday, a bunch
of prisoners put a tiny bird
in your food, and you ate it.

02:21.175 --> 02:24.011
[ Gasps ]
Wasn't gonna say anything,
but now I want you to suffer.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.447
[ Earl Narrating ]
Me and Randy were just
beginning our journey...

02:26.514 --> 02:30.218
and Joy was tryin' to end
hers by giving birth to her
half-sister's overdue baby.

02:30.284 --> 02:33.654
Whichever one of you
pregnant bitches thinks you're
goin' next, you are wrong.

02:33.721 --> 02:36.290
I need to get some drugs
to kick-start this delivery!

02:36.357 --> 02:38.959
You promised your sister
you'd deliver naturally.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.329
You want their little one
coming into this world
dripping with lies?

02:41.395 --> 02:43.096
Darnell, you know my word
doesn't mean anything.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.267
If it did, you and I wouldn't
have been humping when
I was still married to Earl.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.469
In that case, the shame
was part of the rush.

02:48.536 --> 02:51.539
But without illicit sex,
shame is just shame.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.475
Whatever.
Excuse me!
[ Pounds On Desk ]

02:54.542 --> 02:57.778
Hey, last name's Turner.
I need to see a doctor, pronto.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.383
Dr. Pronto to reception,
please. Dr. Pronto.

03:05.486 --> 03:08.422
You gotta be kiddin' me.

03:08.489 --> 03:11.959
You know what?
If somebody shows up,
I'll take 'em.

03:13.594 --> 03:16.497
[ Earl Narrating ]
While Joy was tryin'
to push out one child,

03:16.564 --> 03:18.366
Darnell had asked Catalina
to watch their other two.

03:18.432 --> 03:21.669
You can hang out in here.
Don't be scared.
No one died in this room.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.505
They made it
to the stairway.
It smells.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.308
What are we gonna
do in here?

03:27.375 --> 03:29.443
I don't know.
I'm not very good with kids.

03:29.510 --> 03:33.847
No offense, but you guys freak
me out with your tiny hands and
teeth falling out all the time.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.252
Do you know any games?

03:38.319 --> 03:42.155
When I was a little girl,
we used to play a game called
"Hide and Don't Peek."

03:42.222 --> 03:44.358
How do you play?

03:44.425 --> 03:48.028
An armed gunman
takes your family hostage
while you run and hide,

03:48.095 --> 03:51.064
and then you pray the guerrillas
leave before they find you.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.166
And how do you win?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.969
By pulling the bodies
on top of you and lying
very, very still.

03:59.973 --> 04:03.777
[ Earl Narrating ] It felt good
to be outside the prison walls,
but not too good.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.780
Really, are these necessary?
It's prison policy.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.916
Oh, like taking convicts
for ice cream.

04:08.982 --> 04:13.186
No, that's not prison policy.
Haven't you learned anything
from what I did?

04:13.253 --> 04:16.023
What's this?
It's a search dog.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.058
I had him
sniff Frank's bed.

04:18.125 --> 04:21.662
Randy, the warden doesn't want
word to get out that we're
chasing an escaped convict.

04:21.729 --> 04:26.033
Don't you think a guy
in a prison guard uniform with
a search dog is kinda obvious?

04:26.099 --> 04:29.437
Don't you think a guy
in a prisoner uniform with
handcuffs is kinda obvious?

04:29.503 --> 04:32.573
[ Scoffs ]
Glass houses, Earl.
Glass houses.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.310
We're not takin' the stupid dog,
Randy. I already found out
where Frank's headed.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.312
[ Earl Narrating ]
After I'd left the warden's,

04:38.379 --> 04:40.881
I went to find Frank's
old stealin' buddy.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.983
Paco, I didn't know
you knew how to write music.

04:43.050 --> 04:47.321
Turns out it's easy.
It's just dots and lines.

04:47.388 --> 04:51.359
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna find someone
to play it for me.

04:51.425 --> 04:54.595
I can't wait to hear
what it sounds like.

04:54.662 --> 04:58.999
So, uh,
maybe you haven't heard,
but Frank escaped.

04:59.066 --> 05:02.770
Damn it! Frank escaped?
He gonna get all the money
that we hid in the trailer.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.272
Wait, you guys hid money
in our trailer?

05:05.339 --> 05:07.675
Uh, no.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.779
- Thanks, Paco.
- Damn.

I hope this song
is a sad song.

Give me the keys and uncuff me
so I can drive.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.153
I'm drivin'.
I'm in charge.

05:20.220 --> 05:23.056
Randy, you're not in charge.
Plus, your foot's too big.

05:23.123 --> 05:26.694
When you drive, your shoe
hits the gas and the brake at
the same time. It's terrifying.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.196
I'm driving.
I'm the cop.
You're not a cop.

05:29.262 --> 05:33.333
If I'm not a cop, how come when
I pull up at the Home "Dee-pot"
all those guys run away?

05:33.401 --> 05:36.069
You mean,
like your dog just did?
[ Barking In Distance ]

05:38.338 --> 05:43.076

I'll just have to pick up
his scent on my own.

[ Sniffing ]

05:56.824 --> 05:59.993
This is kinda small.
Oh, whatever.

06:09.503 --> 06:12.305
Oh, my God.

06:12.372 --> 06:16.610
Look at this place.
This must be where pregnant
brides come on their honeymoon.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.880
And here's some extra services
available for a nominal fee.

06:19.947 --> 06:24.652
"Volcanic mud mask,
aromatherapy, eucalyptus wrap."

06:24.718 --> 06:28.021
That sounds delicious.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.491
Is the feminine face peel
just for the ladies...

06:30.558 --> 06:32.860
or can the gentlemen
purchase that as well?

06:32.926 --> 06:35.996
- Who pays for
all these nominals?
- Since you're just a surrogate,

06:36.063 --> 06:39.166
it would be Mr. and Mrs. Ray-Ray
and Liberty Washington.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.002
Good. Then bring us
some of those eucalyptus things.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.605
Extra mayo.
Miracle Whip, if you got it.
And could you hurry up?

06:44.672 --> 06:47.675
Because I want to eat
before the nurse gets here
with that inducing shot.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.377
Mm-hmm.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.713
Can you believe
this fancy menu?

06:52.780 --> 06:55.749
I swear, it's like I've died
and gone to Chili's.

Joy's trailer,

06:57.918 --> 07:00.220
waitin' for Frank to show up
and get his money.

07:00.287 --> 07:03.457
And as luck would have it,
I was spending my one day
out of prison...

locked up in a small space
with another man.

I'm at the American terminal,
and I don't see you.

Nah, I haven't had dinner yet.
I thought we'd pick somethin'
up on our way into town.

Randy, what are you doin'?

07:16.336 --> 07:18.438
Hang on. I got someone
talkin' to me.

07:18.506 --> 07:22.175
I just wanted to see
what it'd be like
to have a cell phone.

07:23.544 --> 07:27.881
Sorry.
That was my brother.
Yeah, he really is.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.551
Uh, yeah, you're gonna have
to find your own way home,

07:30.618 --> 07:33.887
'cause my brother took a bunch
of prisoners for ice cream,
and then he lost one.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.824
So we can't go anywhere
'cause he's a sucky guard.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.159
You look so stupid
right now.

to stop acting like a kid,

to start acting like one.

Nope.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.141

No.

Hot potatoes were rare,
reserved for birthdays only.

How about patty-cake?

Is that where
you go like this...

and then get hit in the face
for playing games instead
of working the coca fields?

08:09.790 --> 08:13.594
Just clap hands with me.
Nothing bad is going to happen.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.938
Randy, just give me the keys
so I can uncuff myself.

08:25.005 --> 08:29.076
I'm not supposed to uncuff
a prisoner just because he asks.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.111
Says so in the manual.

08:31.178 --> 08:34.447

if a prisoner does this?

That's what
it's supposed to be.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.977
Then they nailed it.
This place is great.

they were doin', they would just
get everybody great insurance.

called to say
our surrogate was admitted.

And they offered me a discount
on a newborn photo shoot.

he's on the space shuttle.

to give birth underwater?

me with some kind of fish baby,
did you?
