00:10.090 --> 00:14.110
-I heard gunshots.
-Did you see what happened?

00:14.130 --> 00:16.190
-We good?
-You keep your mouth shut, we're good.

00:16.210 --> 00:18.080
He says the Police Commission's
moving forward

00:18.100 --> 00:20.130
with the investigation.
We gotta get ahead of this.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.070
She's their second informant.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.090
Price talks to the Police Commission,
we're all screwed.

00:24.110 --> 00:27.100
-You two know each other.
-He runs half the corners in our area.

00:28.050 --> 00:30.100
-Clinton.
-We're petitioning sole custody

00:30.120 --> 00:33.050
of Veronica,  and  we'll win.

00:33.070 --> 00:35.110
Aaah!

00:35.130 --> 00:36.210
Stop, Daddy!

00:36.230 --> 00:39.200
Every time I look at you,
you wanna know what I see?

00:39.220 --> 00:42.170
Your so-called father,
holding me down.

00:42.190 --> 00:45.210
We put our asses at risk twice
tryin' to save your father.

00:45.230 --> 00:48.220
-I pay for results, not attempts.
-You don't pay for shit.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.010
That's the problem, ain't it?

00:50.030 --> 00:52.120
-What the hell you want, Kraley?
-To meet and talk.

00:52.140 --> 00:54.100
About what?
- The payday.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.130
What if you and I
got out of this shit city?

00:56.150 --> 00:58.070
Find a way to make that happen,
would you come with me?

00:58.090 --> 01:00.110
-I gotta handle these calls.
-You didn't say no.

01:06.090 --> 01:08.190
-Who killed my grandson?
-Please don't.

01:08.210 --> 01:10.190
-Who?
-It was Steve Hammond.

01:10.210 --> 01:11.230
No more games!

01:13.170 --> 01:16.210
Lucky for you, you're more
valuable to me than they are.

01:16.230 --> 01:19.010
I need you. I don't need them.

01:19.030 --> 01:20.210
Easy.

02:22.080 --> 02:26.030
Por favor.

02:31.050 --> 02:32.170
Por favor, Don Ignacio.

02:36.010 --> 02:37.180
Don Ignacio. Don Ignacio!

02:47.160 --> 02:49.140
Ricardito.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.100
Por favor,  Ricardito.

03:00.230 --> 03:03.150
Yo tengo una familia! No!

03:18.160 --> 03:20.060
Gracias, Ricardo.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.210
Gracias.

03:25.140 --> 03:26.160
No, no!

03:28.230 --> 03:31.050
Carmencita! Carmencita!

03:31.070 --> 03:34.040
Carmencita!
No, no, no,  Carmencita!

04:20.200 --> 04:23.000
The punishment for betrayal is death.

04:23.020 --> 04:24.040
No!!!

04:24.060 --> 04:26.090
She screwed up
because she's young.

04:26.110 --> 04:29.150
She was worried about her sister.

04:29.170 --> 04:31.130
I would have done the same thing.

04:31.150 --> 04:34.100
Leave them alone,
I'll do whatever you want.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.060
Whatever I want?

04:41.160 --> 04:44.020
Please don't. Please don't.

04:45.130 --> 04:47.070
Please!

04:55.110 --> 04:57.060
What are you gonna do to her?

04:57.080 --> 04:59.120
- She'll pay a price.
- Oh, yeah?

04:59.140 --> 05:02.070
-What price?
-It's my business, not yours.

05:02.090 --> 05:04.170
What happens once,
happens again.

05:04.190 --> 05:06.170
If it does, it's on me. Stay there.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.200
Right?

05:16.020 --> 05:17.090
Thank you.

06:08.180 --> 06:11.130
How is this supposed to help? Hmm?

06:17.120 --> 06:19.200
If we're gonna get head of this, Pete,

06:19.220 --> 06:21.160
I need you right.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.210
Pfft. Look at me--
do I look right?

06:25.230 --> 06:29.120
As in sober.
Focused.

06:29.140 --> 06:31.160
Functional.

06:31.180 --> 06:34.030
We're buried in shit, Steve.

06:35.070 --> 06:37.120
I'm gonna lose my little girl.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.180
You're gonna lose more than that
if you don't stop

06:44.200 --> 06:46.150
feeling sorry for yourself.

06:56.070 --> 06:59.080
All we do is destroy
the good things we got.

07:00.210 --> 07:02.150
My mother.

07:04.060 --> 07:05.110
My family.

07:08.190 --> 07:10.180
You may be OK with that.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.050
I'm not.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.100
I'm here for you, buddy.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.030
But you gotta meet me halfway.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.190
What if you and I got out of Dodge?

07:31.210 --> 07:35.050
Indefinitely. Find a way to make that
happen, would you come with me?

07:36.040 --> 07:37.110
You didn't say no.

08:09.090 --> 08:10.200
I heard.

08:12.060 --> 08:15.060
-You OK?
-I'm fine.

08:22.020 --> 08:24.180
I know you're hurtin', Karen.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.120
But right now it's about survival.

08:27.140 --> 08:30.040
And we got a couple of problems
I need your help with.

08:31.020 --> 08:33.070
So tell me.

08:33.090 --> 08:35.170
We got a shitstorm brewing
with the cartel.

08:35.190 --> 08:38.090
But I want you on the fallout
from the article.

08:40.030 --> 08:41.140
Check with Hoke.

08:42.120 --> 08:45.100
And listen, we gotta find a way
to shut Price up.

08:47.090 --> 08:49.230
I'm on it. She'll keep her mouth shut.

08:54.170 --> 08:56.090
All right,
you're in a bad place right now.

08:56.110 --> 08:58.070
Why don't you just text me the info,
I'll send Ramos.

08:58.090 --> 09:00.140
You will not.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.220
That bitch is mine.

09:05.070 --> 09:07.050
Just don't make it worse.

09:49.020 --> 09:52.070
They had a  gun  in my sister's face!

09:52.090 --> 09:54.120
-They wanted the truth.
-Yeah, so you  lie.

09:54.140 --> 09:56.130
You make 'em believe it  is  the truth.

09:57.230 --> 10:00.100
-What's goin' on?
-She gave up Steve.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.230
-Almost got him killed.
-I had no choice.

10:03.010 --> 10:05.100
Your sister--
she gonna keep her mouth shut?

10:07.200 --> 10:10.100
She's scared. But yeah.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.150
Yes. Yes.

10:13.170 --> 10:16.180
Maybe I was wrong. Maybe Kraley
shouldn't have given her ink.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.100
You woulda stayed outside that night,

10:18.120 --> 10:21.060
like you were told,
none of this woulda happened.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.100
I heard gunshots.
I thought I should go inside--

10:23.120 --> 10:25.060
You do what you're told, when you're told,
and how you're told.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.100
-Yeah, but I--
-Do you understand?!

10:27.120 --> 10:30.040
Come on, man,
we've all made dumb moves, Steve.

10:33.210 --> 10:36.150
You wanna co-sign for her, she's yours.
Keep her in line.

10:39.030 --> 10:42.120
One more slip, any one thing...

10:42.140 --> 10:43.160
you're done.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.010
And you better learn fast.

10:55.020 --> 10:57.180
I don't know
where the hell Kraley is,

10:57.200 --> 11:00.150
so it's up to us
to shovel the shit we're buried in.

11:00.170 --> 11:04.010
Cole, I need you to take charge
of our public image.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.130
If you can tell me what that means.

11:05.150 --> 11:09.060
Get out in the community
and find us friends, man.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.190
We need to paint that article
as a hit piece.

11:11.210 --> 11:13.090
Yeah, OK.

11:13.110 --> 11:17.040
And by the way, that stash house
where Foster bought it?

11:17.060 --> 11:19.040
-Yeah.
-Kraley and I

11:19.060 --> 11:21.220
escorted a cartel shipment there
a couple days ago.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.190
That's one hell of a coincidence.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.190
Steve.

11:35.010 --> 11:37.120
I need to earn,
or I'm gonna lose Veronica.

11:37.140 --> 11:42.000
So I don't give a shit about Kraley,
Foster, or our goddamn public image!

12:03.220 --> 12:07.010
Jesus Christ. You're gonna break
the godamn window.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.220
Fuck. I gotta go home
and change my shirt.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.180
What's the department doing
about the article?

12:11.200 --> 12:14.090
-You ever gonna do anything for me?
-Like what?

12:14.110 --> 12:16.110
Like a clean shirt, for starters.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.120
All right, look.

12:21.140 --> 12:24.070
This thing's way too big
to sweep all the way under the rug.

12:24.090 --> 12:25.200
OK?

12:25.220 --> 12:28.190
The brass wants scalps.
Someone's gonna get indicted.

12:28.210 --> 12:31.090
Yeah, no shit.
Are they coming after the Ravens?

12:35.050 --> 12:37.070
All right, look,
they're gonna hit the Vipers first.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.010
When a cop gets killed
trying to rob a cartel stash house,

12:40.030 --> 12:41.200
they get moved to the front of the line.

12:41.220 --> 12:44.060
Yeah, I don't give a shit
about the Vipers.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.170
What'd you hear about us?

12:45.190 --> 12:48.070
Rumor has it there's a lot of shit
that was left out of that article

12:48.090 --> 12:51.060
'cause the main source
is holding on for leverage.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.100
Leverage with who?

12:53.120 --> 12:55.100
Who's the source?

12:55.120 --> 12:59.000
I don't know. Reporter won't say.
Journalistic privilege or some shit.

12:59.020 --> 13:02.120
Never mind.
I'm pretty sure I already know who.

13:02.140 --> 13:05.210
-It was nice to see you. As always.
-Mm-hmm.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.150
Your school called.

13:38.110 --> 13:40.020
They said you just walked out.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.050
Talk to me, Dani.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.140
They...killed those men.

14:12.140 --> 14:14.100
And they were gonna kill us.

14:24.020 --> 14:26.130
I'm sorry I got you involved
in all of this.

14:31.110 --> 14:33.030
I really am.

14:35.230 --> 14:38.030
But you gotta stay quiet.

14:41.110 --> 14:43.050
To protect your friend?

14:46.070 --> 14:47.210
To protect us.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.200
Protect us.

14:54.190 --> 14:57.030
Come here. Come here.

14:57.210 --> 14:59.130
Come here, come here.

15:00.150 --> 15:03.100
Come here.

15:28.070 --> 15:29.160
Amber.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.210
-Hey. Hey.
-Hey.

15:36.120 --> 15:40.020
Probably be getting hungry later,
ya know. Maybe around dinnertime?

15:40.040 --> 15:43.120
OK, that's funny, 'cause that's
when I get hungry too.

15:43.140 --> 15:46.000
So what should we do about it?

15:46.020 --> 15:48.210
-I'll take you somewhere--
-I didn't expect to see you at this.

15:48.230 --> 15:51.160
I stopped by to show that I care.

15:54.230 --> 15:57.020
There's somebody over here
I want you to get to know better.

16:06.100 --> 16:09.100
Today he's here for us, Cole,
just like you.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.220
People can change.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.160
That's why I still have hope
for both of you.

16:16.130 --> 16:18.200
Clinton organized all this.

16:18.220 --> 16:22.170
Got people to pitch in
and donate things they'd outgrown

16:22.190 --> 16:24.110
or didn't need anymore.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.040
He really motivated 'em.

16:27.060 --> 16:29.090
Yeah, the only thing
he motivates is misery.

16:33.150 --> 16:35.140
There's no trouble here, fellas.

16:37.170 --> 16:41.000
It's all good, Pastor.
Let's just leave it.

16:57.150 --> 17:00.090
There's a turf war brewing,
you know?

17:00.110 --> 17:02.090
Innocent people are gonna get hurt.

17:02.110 --> 17:04.070
Street drama.

17:04.090 --> 17:06.180
That's on him and his guys,
not us.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.130
It's the other side
that I'm worried about.

17:10.150 --> 17:12.170
That Neckbone wannabe.

17:15.060 --> 17:18.040
Yeah. G's a piece of work.

17:21.160 --> 17:25.100
It'd be nice for community relations
if you, uh...

17:25.120 --> 17:28.170
shut it down before it gets out of hand.

18:09.020 --> 18:10.200
Don't look at them,
they're not gonna help you.

18:13.060 --> 18:15.040
What do you want?

18:15.060 --> 18:17.110
Didn't tell the reporter everything,
did ya?

18:17.130 --> 18:20.060
If I had, you'd be in cuffs right now.

18:20.080 --> 18:24.010
You think you can leverage yourself
out of this by taking us down?

18:24.030 --> 18:26.140
I've got enough to bargain down
my sentence.

18:26.160 --> 18:30.080
And what's that?
Twenty years instead of forty?

18:30.100 --> 18:32.180
Stiff price for a little payback, bitch.

18:32.200 --> 18:36.060
You assholes cost me my job, my pension,
my kids, my freedom.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.170
You get me out from underneath
these charges, all of them,

18:38.190 --> 18:40.190
then we can talk about your needs.

18:40.210 --> 18:44.030
Otherwise I'm taking you--
every one of you--down with me.

19:01.050 --> 19:02.110
Yeah.

19:02.130 --> 19:05.090
We have a problem. Come here immediately.

19:10.070 --> 19:11.220
Couldn't do this over the phone?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.060
If you've paid the ransom,
it's on the Mexicans

19:14.080 --> 19:17.060
to give your father back.
What's to discuss?

19:17.080 --> 19:19.040
I didn't ask you here
to talk about that.

19:19.060 --> 19:20.160
-Then what?
-We have a problem

19:20.180 --> 19:22.000
with something Kraley's done.

19:22.020 --> 19:24.090
Then that's between you and Kraley.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.200
Where  is  Kraley?

19:30.220 --> 19:32.180
Don't know. Why?

19:32.200 --> 19:34.110
It's odd, you know,

19:34.130 --> 19:38.080
a cop attacking one of our money houses
right after he became aware of it?

19:38.100 --> 19:40.070
Kraley's not that stupid.

19:40.090 --> 19:42.050
Smart enough to disappear, though.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.080
-Where is he?
-For the second time,

19:45.100 --> 19:47.180
-I don't know.
-Hmm.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.120
If you find him, tell him
I'm lookin' for him too.

19:49.140 --> 19:50.210
No, you're gonna find him.

19:50.230 --> 19:53.130
And then you're gonna come back to me
and you're gonna let me know.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.160
And if I don't?

19:58.180 --> 20:00.120
We both know the answer to that.

20:13.230 --> 20:16.160
You really think Kraley was behind
Foster hittin' that stash house?

20:18.180 --> 20:22.030
His place has been emptied out,
and he's not answering his cell.

20:25.170 --> 20:28.010
So he's gone,
and left us with the tab.

20:29.180 --> 20:32.180
Steve, look at you.

20:35.090 --> 20:36.110
Look at us, man.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.170
I'm gonna miss comin' here, brother.

20:43.060 --> 20:44.110
Yeah.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.160
Me too.

20:55.070 --> 20:57.020
Steve.

20:58.070 --> 20:59.110
You good?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.080
Yeah.

21:06.130 --> 21:08.090
You sure about this?

21:08.110 --> 21:10.110
What are we gonna do with a house?

22:02.040 --> 22:03.210
Have you seen Kraley?

22:04.210 --> 22:06.020
No.

22:07.220 --> 22:10.000
Ricardo's gunnin' for him.

22:12.150 --> 22:15.210
-He's a piece of shit.
-Which one?

22:17.080 --> 22:18.160
Both.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.190
I'm sorry about Foster.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.040
He had some good points.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.030
He's a piece of shit too.

22:32.090 --> 22:35.030
And you aren't sorry.
You never liked him in the first place.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.160
-Can I get a word, please?
-Yeah, sure.

22:47.180 --> 22:48.200
OK.

22:51.010 --> 22:55.110
So, you've done a great job,
and I really appreciate it.

22:55.130 --> 22:58.040
The thing is that
I'm a hundred percent now

22:58.060 --> 23:01.130
and I really don't need
a second bartender.

23:01.150 --> 23:05.180
So I'm thinking that two weeks' severance
and a recommendation.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.040
I mean, your receipts have doubled
since I got here.

23:10.060 --> 23:13.100
Just think about how much
this has to do with your ego,

23:13.120 --> 23:15.160
and just come talk to me tomorrow.

23:17.070 --> 23:18.090
Come on.

23:29.110 --> 23:31.020
You look irritated.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.090
Everything OK?

23:33.100 --> 23:36.030
Worry about you. Not me.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.190
I ain't doin' this shit for you, Hammond.

23:47.210 --> 23:49.110
The Hangmen weren't mentioned
in that article,

23:49.130 --> 23:51.050
and I wanna keep it that way.

23:51.070 --> 23:52.210
I'm not askin' you to kill her.

23:52.230 --> 23:55.020
Just put her on the mainline
for a half hour.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.120
Let her get good and scared,
then let me in to talk to her.

23:57.140 --> 24:00.130
She's a fed, bro.
It's gonna bring heat behind it.

24:00.150 --> 24:01.230
Or worse.

24:02.010 --> 24:04.010
Some crazy-ass bitch
is gonna put a shank in her

24:04.030 --> 24:05.150
the same way they did your old man.

24:05.170 --> 24:07.080
Dereliction of duty.

24:07.100 --> 24:09.010
That's the best thing
I could hope for.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.190
Fuck. No, man.
I ain't takin' that kind of heat for you.

24:11.210 --> 24:14.110
Department's gonna clean house
unless we stop this.

24:14.130 --> 24:17.090
-Your club's not immune.
-Is that a threat, Ramos?

24:17.110 --> 24:19.050
Your club goes down,
you take us with you?

24:19.070 --> 24:22.210
You really think the Hangmen
aren't gonna get swept up in the net?

24:22.230 --> 24:25.090
First they come for us, then you.

24:25.110 --> 24:27.120
Help us out here. Help yourself.

24:27.140 --> 24:30.180
You know how I help myself out?
By staying the hell away from you guys.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.100
I'm out.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.000
So now what?

24:41.020 --> 24:44.070
We're down to one option.
The cartel.

24:44.090 --> 24:46.210
Chances are they have people
locked up in county

24:46.230 --> 24:48.190
who can put the fear of God into Price.

24:48.210 --> 24:51.140
- So they get their hooks in us deeper?
- It's that or prison.

24:51.160 --> 24:54.180
The cartel will have our balls
in a vise  forever.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.120
No parole,
no time off for good behavior.

24:57.140 --> 24:59.140
So why don't we just
have 'em take her out?

24:59.160 --> 25:01.200
- If she's dead, she can't talk.
- Yeah!

25:01.220 --> 25:05.010
Let's just add first-degree murder
to the mix, right?

25:05.030 --> 25:08.150
Cops ordering a hit on an FBI agent?
Federal death penalty crime.

25:08.170 --> 25:10.190
I did not sign up for this shit, Steve!

25:12.090 --> 25:16.090
I know you're in a bad place,
but back the fuck off, Karen.

25:16.110 --> 25:19.030
Do we have a goddamn choice?

25:19.050 --> 25:20.120
Seriously?

25:22.040 --> 25:24.090
This is how you handle things,
Steve?

25:25.170 --> 25:27.160
Shit.

25:29.100 --> 25:32.040
I wasn't here.
I didn't hear any of this shit.

25:32.230 --> 25:35.200
And you! You call me
when you start thinking straight.

25:35.220 --> 25:37.170
'Cause right now you ain't.

25:55.210 --> 25:57.200
You sure you want this life?

26:01.180 --> 26:04.060
-Yeah.
-Tell me why.

26:05.180 --> 26:08.050
What do you mean?

26:08.070 --> 26:11.110
Tell me why
you needed to be a Raven.

26:11.130 --> 26:14.090
Because if I'm gonna help you
survive this,

26:14.110 --> 26:16.140
I'm gonna need to know
where your head is at.

26:20.140 --> 26:24.070
My old man was a Raven.
So was Carl.

26:24.090 --> 26:27.090
I always admired
how they looked out for each other.

26:27.110 --> 26:29.200
Stop that shit, OK?

26:29.220 --> 26:31.130
Look, tell me the truth.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.220
Both my parents are dead.

26:43.200 --> 26:45.020
I'm broke half the time.

26:46.100 --> 26:49.070
I'm tryin' to take care of my sister
on a cop's salary.

26:50.140 --> 26:53.170
It scares the shit out of me
to think I could fail her.

26:53.190 --> 26:56.080
Now, that's something
I can understand.

27:19.130 --> 27:21.070
Oh, shit.

27:21.090 --> 27:24.010
That's one of Clinton's runners, isn't it?

27:24.030 --> 27:25.100
Yeah.

27:28.170 --> 27:29.190
What you got?

27:31.070 --> 27:33.000
Look who's here.

27:33.020 --> 27:34.060
Unit heard shots.

27:34.080 --> 27:38.090
Rolled up, found this guy layin' dead
and your friend here walkin' away.

27:38.110 --> 27:40.080
You didn't find a gun on me, did you?

27:40.100 --> 27:42.070
The guy did get shot, didn't he?

27:43.120 --> 27:46.010
I don't see how I could shoot nobody
without a gun.

27:46.030 --> 27:47.110
Detective.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.160
-You got this?
-I got it.

27:53.190 --> 27:55.120
You got some weak players
on your team.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.030
Cut the bullshit, man.
Why is the kid dead, G?

28:01.050 --> 28:03.080
I'm makin' moves.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.050
I took a bullet for these streets.

28:05.070 --> 28:08.070
I'm takin' back  all  Neckbone's corners.

28:08.090 --> 28:12.000
So y'all wanna give me the same
arrangement that you gave him?

28:12.020 --> 28:15.050
We're not in that protection business.
Try the Vipers.

28:15.070 --> 28:17.210
Hell, no. Listen, Cole,

28:17.230 --> 28:19.220
I know you got some heat on you
right now,

28:20.000 --> 28:21.130
so I don't know why
you just don't step back

28:21.150 --> 28:23.170
and let me do what the hell
I got to do.

28:23.190 --> 28:27.000
You want a street war? Huh?
Is that what you want?

28:27.020 --> 28:31.000
Because that's on you. Not us.

28:31.020 --> 28:33.120
-You're serious.
-I'm serious.

28:40.060 --> 28:42.030
Then buckle up.

29:07.010 --> 29:08.150
I said I'd be here.

29:08.170 --> 29:10.170
Also said you'd get here  first.

29:11.190 --> 29:14.200
I did say that, didn't I?

29:23.080 --> 29:26.110
All units, all units,
we have officer in need of assistance.

29:26.130 --> 29:29.130
Shots fired at Oceanside and Third.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.070
- Where you hit?
- My leg.

29:48.130 --> 29:49.170
Go! Just go!

29:50.200 --> 29:52.050
-He good?
-Yeah.

29:52.070 --> 29:54.100
-One down. Two here.
-Copy.

29:57.030 --> 29:58.130
Go. Go.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.140
We need a medic over here  now.

30:10.160 --> 30:13.000
- What happened?
- You tell me.

30:13.020 --> 30:15.040
That's Colombian ink
around their necks.

30:17.130 --> 30:18.210
So be careful.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.130
They're muscle for Carmen's brother.

30:23.150 --> 30:27.100
Why would he hit these guys?
He tryin' to take over from his father?

30:27.120 --> 30:29.150
-I don't know.
-Better find out.

30:33.070 --> 30:34.080
I'm just saying,

30:34.100 --> 30:36.050
I don't like gray.

30:36.070 --> 30:39.230
Not everything is black and white.
Gotta make allowances.

30:40.010 --> 30:42.200
But you and my father make
some pretty dicey allowances.

30:42.220 --> 30:46.150
-Such as?
-Clinton. He's a drug dealer.

30:46.170 --> 30:49.160
Our side is not giving him a pass.

30:49.180 --> 30:52.020
We just don't have enough
to make a case on him.

30:52.040 --> 30:54.180
Six shootings in three days?

30:54.200 --> 30:58.050
It's not as easy as it looks, Amber.
Just so you know that.

30:59.060 --> 31:02.040
And as a cop...

31:02.060 --> 31:05.060
I get stuck, you know?
In this revolvin' door,

31:05.080 --> 31:06.140
with guys like Clinton.

31:06.160 --> 31:11.010
Arrest, release.
Arrest, release.

31:11.030 --> 31:14.030
Look, at least you save lives.

31:14.050 --> 31:16.050
It's another revolving door.

31:16.070 --> 31:20.010
Patch 'em up, send 'em back out
into the same war zone.

31:20.030 --> 31:22.160
Wait for 'em to show up again,
because you know they will,

31:22.180 --> 31:24.140
probably dead next time.

31:28.230 --> 31:31.030
Pfft.

31:31.050 --> 31:33.200
This isn't the most cheerful date
I've been on.

31:36.220 --> 31:38.220
Let's talk about something else.

32:05.070 --> 32:08.180
Your brother has no intention
of getting your father back alive.

32:08.200 --> 32:11.160
-What's happened?
-His men hit the ports.

32:11.180 --> 32:14.090
Some Mexicans are dead,
and a cop got shot.

32:14.110 --> 32:17.070
-What about my father?
-I don't know, Carmen.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.210
If he's not already dead,
he's gonna be,

32:23.230 --> 32:25.220
unless you can get your brother
to pump the brakes.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.180
My brother won't listen to me.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.120
Things aren't good
between us right now.

32:46.080 --> 32:48.070
Visiting hours are over.

32:48.090 --> 32:50.140
You're gonna want to hear
what I have to say.

32:51.180 --> 32:53.160
You speakin' for yourself?

32:53.180 --> 32:55.050
Or the Colombians?

32:55.230 --> 32:59.020
I don't speak for them.
I don't care about 'em.

33:00.110 --> 33:01.210
They should step back,

33:01.230 --> 33:04.200
because the Mexes
are gonna put in work.

33:04.220 --> 33:09.170
Yeah. But it's you caught in the middle,
Eli, isn't it?

33:09.190 --> 33:13.020
And if your Mexicans retaliate,
who do you think's gonna win?

33:13.220 --> 33:16.220
My money's on the Colombians,
but either way, you lose.

33:25.020 --> 33:28.070
-This was supposed to be easy money, man.
-Mm-hmm.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.160
Just hang around, look the other way,

33:30.180 --> 33:33.150
let 'em load and unload,
make sure nobody interferes.

33:33.170 --> 33:35.200
I think you and me
can get this to settle down,

33:35.220 --> 33:37.020
but you gotta give me two things.

33:37.040 --> 33:40.090
-You "think"?
-I got no guarantees, Eli.

33:41.230 --> 33:43.130
And you can always say no.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.100
So let's hear it.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.190
I need the Mexicans' next shipment date,

33:51.210 --> 33:54.070
and the Horsemen
to deliver Ignacio.

33:57.040 --> 34:00.110
-Think you can trust Eli?
-He gave me what I asked.

34:00.130 --> 34:03.130
-Yeah, could be he lied.
-We'll find out soon enough.

34:03.150 --> 34:06.230
-And you need Price to make it work?
-Yeah.

34:07.010 --> 34:09.200
-We're screwed.
-It's worth a shot.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.120
It's my house phone. Hello?

34:18.220 --> 34:21.170
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Don't let anybody in.

34:31.010 --> 34:33.000
-Hey.
- Dad.

34:33.020 --> 34:36.020
-Missed you so much.
-Missed you too. You all right?

34:36.040 --> 34:37.170
-Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah.
-Yeah?

34:37.190 --> 34:39.230
I'm gonna say bye,
I'll be right back.

34:42.190 --> 34:44.080
I can't believe she ran away.

34:45.030 --> 34:47.230
-I gotta handle this.
-All right, man. You need me?

34:48.010 --> 34:49.210
No. But thanks.

34:49.230 --> 34:51.210
Let me know if that changes.
I'll be at county.

34:51.230 --> 34:53.130
-Copy.
-Hey, V.

34:53.150 --> 34:54.210
Hi, Hamm!

35:13.080 --> 35:16.190
What could you possibly offer me
to let you off the hook?

35:16.210 --> 35:20.080
Leverage. To get your ass out of here.

35:20.100 --> 35:23.080
Listen.

35:23.100 --> 35:26.030
You agree to stonewall
the Police Commission,

35:26.050 --> 35:29.080
don't tell 'em a damn thing...

35:29.100 --> 35:33.190
and I'll give you a tip for the biggest
drug shipment in DEA history.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.080
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:37.100 --> 35:38.200
Enjoy.

35:38.220 --> 35:41.090
So, how you like your new school?

35:41.110 --> 35:43.010
It's OK, I guess.

35:43.030 --> 35:46.170
-Yeah? Make any new friends yet?
-A few.

36:00.220 --> 36:04.100
Look...I know things
are hard right now.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.150
And right now your mom and I
are acting like...

36:07.170 --> 36:10.150
well, we're actin' like jerks.

36:10.170 --> 36:12.230
I realize I'm not supposed
to use that word...

36:13.010 --> 36:15.230
but in this case, I think it applies.

36:16.010 --> 36:17.090
Ya know?

36:19.030 --> 36:22.040
I'm kinda rambling here,
aren't it?

36:23.050 --> 36:27.130
Yeah. What I'm tryin to say is,
it's all gonna get better.

36:27.150 --> 36:30.050
Even the stuff
between me and your mom.

36:30.070 --> 36:31.210
It's gonna mellow out, I promise.

36:31.230 --> 36:33.080
-OK?
-OK.

36:37.100 --> 36:39.070
I wanna live in our old house.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.160
Sorry,  princesa,
but I have to take you home.

36:42.180 --> 36:43.230
I don't  want  to go back there!

36:44.010 --> 36:45.110
I don't want you to have
to go back there either,

36:45.130 --> 36:47.060
but that's the way
it has to be right now, OK?

36:48.200 --> 36:50.020
Listen, I--

37:04.160 --> 37:06.120
Here ya go.

37:18.150 --> 37:20.170
The longer you wait,
the further he gets.

37:53.220 --> 37:58.060
Princesa,  look, I know
it's hard to understand right now, but--

37:58.080 --> 37:59.130
I--

38:01.090 --> 38:02.200
Veronica.

38:04.030 --> 38:05.120
Veronica!

38:12.030 --> 38:14.070
What the hell were you thinking?

38:14.090 --> 38:16.040
How do you think that's
gonna look in court?

38:17.020 --> 38:19.100
She ran  away  from you.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.160
To me!

38:21.160 --> 38:23.170
How's  that  gonna look to a judge?

38:31.160 --> 38:35.080
Ms. Price,
you requested the Police Commission

38:35.100 --> 38:37.050
and myself to be here.

38:37.070 --> 38:39.080
We agreed because you said
you had information.

38:39.100 --> 38:43.150
Are you aware of any criminal gangs
in the department?

38:47.100 --> 38:49.150
During your time at the FBI,

38:49.170 --> 38:51.190
have you ever had any dealings
with them?

38:54.150 --> 38:56.210
You gonna answer
any of our questions here today?

38:56.230 --> 38:58.140
No.

39:05.110 --> 39:07.220
Briggs sent us.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.020
Open up.

39:16.110 --> 39:18.050
- Drop it!
- Get him!

39:18.070 --> 39:20.020
Get down right now!
Don't move!

39:22.080 --> 39:23.100
Up.

40:21.020 --> 40:23.100
Si, Ricardo.
