We were together, like,
a year and a half or so.

in that whole relationship.

14:05.753 --> 14:06.994

14:07.088 --> 14:09.180

relationship,

It felt like we used sex a lot
to, like, band-aid things.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.193

would mask what's going on.

14:22.420 --> 14:23.586

14:23.605 --> 14:25.254

I was in love with, we--
not tmi--

14:35.858 --> 14:37.283
But we had a very good
sex life.

14:37.435 --> 14:39.102

he really likes me

14:39.120 --> 14:40.953
Because we're having sex
all the time.

14:41.106 --> 14:42.955
And then the other extreme
where a guy--

14:43.108 --> 14:44.790
I would--I literally
remember saying to him,

14:44.885 --> 14:46.292
Like, why don't you want
to have sex with me?

14:46.444 --> 14:47.944
And he's like, I do.

14:47.962 --> 14:49.445
I said,
why are we never having sex?

14:49.538 --> 14:50.889
He's like,
oh, we're not having sex?

14:51.116 --> 14:52.724
Like, I have to--
- he didn't realize?

14:52.951 --> 14:54.300
- He was also having sex
with other people.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.061
So I guess he didn't remember
who he was doing what with.

14:57.213 --> 15:00.306
But based on my past
experiences and relationships,

15:00.458 --> 15:03.217
Like, even if I felt
like the sex was amazing,

15:03.236 --> 15:05.386
I never felt fully like, okay,

15:05.405 --> 15:07.296

15:07.315 --> 15:09.298

but I could have been anyone.

without you guys.

17:16.352 --> 17:19.612

or anything?

17:19.764 --> 17:21.522

some boxing gloves

17:21.541 --> 17:24.375

knocked me out flat.

17:44.547 --> 17:46.639
And figuring these little
quirks and stuff out.

17:46.791 --> 17:49.067

17:51.813 --> 17:53.629
Okay, is he joking?

17:53.722 --> 17:55.798
Is there some truth
in that joke?

17:55.817 --> 17:57.633

out of his ass right now?

17:57.726 --> 17:59.226

behind some jokes.

18:02.490 --> 18:04.807
- Um, what about you guys?

18:04.826 --> 18:08.828
- I learned that chris is very
patient and also very calming,

18:08.922 --> 18:12.815
Which is very complementary
to my wild personality.

18:12.908 --> 18:15.075
So I'm very grateful for that.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.427

18:16.579 --> 18:17.486

for each other.

18:17.505 --> 18:18.912

18:19.006 --> 18:20.656

the ladies know,

18:20.675 --> 18:22.491
Like, I had a hard date

18:22.585 --> 18:23.768
For when we were gonna
be physical.

18:23.995 --> 18:25.752
I was like, the second night
of the honeymoon,

18:25.847 --> 18:28.180
That's it, because physical
attraction is so important.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.923
And it is.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.443
But we're choosing to work
on the emotional element,

18:32.595 --> 18:33.778
Which has been great.
- Yeah.

18:34.005 --> 18:34.946
- I mean, we've had more
deep conversations

18:35.173 --> 18:37.173

than I've had in most

18:37.191 --> 18:38.449

- Yeah.

what about you guys?

18:42.271 --> 18:44.455

18:44.607 --> 18:46.532
- I mean, I guess to me
it wasn't a bombshell,

18:46.626 --> 18:48.367
But it kind of took her back
when she found out

18:48.519 --> 18:51.129
That I had never--
I've never been in love.

18:51.356 --> 18:54.132
I guess that came as a shock
since I'm, like, 39.

18:54.359 --> 18:54.874
She's like,
oh, you've never been in love?

18:54.968 --> 18:56.968
You're 39.

18:57.195 --> 18:58.878
But she could be my first love,
you know, so...

18:59.030 --> 19:00.638
- First and last.
- There you go.

jasmine's back out yet?

19:06.537 --> 19:07.870

19:07.963 --> 19:09.705
- He talked about
blowing some back out?

19:09.724 --> 19:10.797
Where'd this come from?

19:10.892 --> 19:11.965
- Absolutely not.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.058

a historical reference.

19:14.729 --> 19:16.970

- Oh, my god.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.139
- My wife, you know,
she's at a bachelorette party,

19:19.233 --> 19:22.067
And she's, like,
just preparing to get

19:22.162 --> 19:24.829
Her back blown out by me in,
like, a couple of days, so...

19:24.980 --> 19:26.055
- I'ma be praying for you,

19:26.148 --> 19:27.331
'cause what if she don't
want that?

19:27.558 --> 19:29.000

an orthopedic surgeon.

19:29.151 --> 19:31.577

their partner naked?

19:36.509 --> 19:38.234
- No.
- No.

- I thought you were

19:41.347 --> 19:43.072

- Me too!

19:43.165 --> 19:44.498
- I thought you were
gonna make a joke.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.925

we have.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.427
[laughter]

19:48.579 --> 19:50.855
- You know, we've had cuddles,
kisses, these types of things.

19:51.082 --> 19:52.081
And I think it's just
gonna come natural,

19:52.174 --> 19:53.674
Just like everything else has.

19:53.768 --> 19:55.008
- Yeah.
What about you guys?

19:55.102 --> 19:57.344
- We're going pretty slow.

19:57.438 --> 19:59.088
We're on first base.

19:59.181 --> 20:01.757
I think jasmine
is attractive, you know?

20:01.850 --> 20:03.442
- Mm-hmm.
- And I feel like I'm a very,

20:03.594 --> 20:06.595
Very, very sexual person.

20:06.614 --> 20:08.873
But, like, that hasn't
served me well in, like,

20:09.024 --> 20:10.374
My past relationships,
you know?

20:10.601 --> 20:12.618
So I'm trying to take
a different approach

20:12.770 --> 20:14.212
In this situation.
- Is that a good thing

20:14.439 --> 20:16.622
Or a bad thing?
- Based on jazz's face?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.123
- Right?
I'm, like, looking.

20:18.276 --> 20:20.367
- It is what it is.
- It is what it is?

20:20.461 --> 20:22.720
- Airris kind of
"explained it" in a way.

20:22.871 --> 20:23.629

<i> if he was just trying</i>

20:23.781 --> 20:24.705

20:24.799 --> 20:26.206
But he says he's
a sexual person.

20:26.226 --> 20:29.560
So I'm just a little confused.

20:29.712 --> 20:31.729
- Shaquille and I had
the same conversations.

20:31.956 --> 20:33.122
Like, we're getting
to know each other.

20:33.215 --> 20:34.732
We're having a good time,
you know?

20:34.959 --> 20:37.142
But I'm like, we need
to start this marriage

20:37.295 --> 20:39.904
On the right foot, like, being
open and honest about things.

20:40.055 --> 20:41.964
I was like, well,
I wasn't expecting

20:41.983 --> 20:42.907
A guy with a bald head.

20:43.058 --> 20:45.317
[laughter]

20:45.411 --> 20:48.395
But he checks off the boxes
in all the other areas.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.322
So forget the, you know,
physical attraction.

20:50.475 --> 20:52.308
That'll grow, so...

20:52.326 --> 20:54.643
- I have been in a relationship
where that has grown later,

20:54.662 --> 20:55.920
And it was like one of the best
relationships I had.

20:56.147 --> 20:57.738

that I was initially, like,

20:59.074 --> 21:00.816

21:00.909 --> 21:02.909
And so, like,
our biggest struggle

21:03.004 --> 21:04.911
Has been physical chemistry.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.580
But I mean, I don't--

21:06.599 --> 21:08.340
I don't think there's,

You can't be like,

33:08.712 --> 33:10.045
- Are you a "friends" fan?
- Pivot.

33:10.063 --> 33:10.821
Yeah, I know
what you're talking about.

33:10.972 --> 33:12.155
- All I do is quote "friends."

33:12.382 --> 33:13.306
- I know exactly
what you're talking about.

33:13.325 --> 33:14.491
- Thank you
for understanding me.

33:14.718 --> 33:16.234
Left, left--
I mean right, right, right.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.902
Pivot!

33:18.055 --> 33:19.721
- All right, we're good.

33:19.740 --> 33:21.556
Here, you must be a little hot.

33:21.575 --> 33:26.061
- Normally, that's truthfully
a pet peeve when I'm--

33:26.154 --> 33:27.395
- Gotcha.
- It's more in a pool.

33:27.414 --> 33:28.988
No, that actually felt amazing.

33:29.008 --> 33:31.082
But you know, if you're
in a pool and you're just,

33:31.235 --> 33:32.658
Like, trying to dip your feet
and someone's splashing you

33:32.678 --> 33:34.994
In the face with water.
I'm like, go away.

33:35.088 --> 33:37.756
- What other pet peeves
do you have?

33:37.850 --> 33:39.665
- So a huge pet peeve,

33:39.760 --> 33:42.244
I call them smps,
slow moving people,

33:42.262 --> 33:45.022
When they just walk super slow
right in front of you

33:45.249 --> 33:46.690
And don't give you
a way around.

33:46.917 --> 33:49.526
But you already walk
so much faster than me.

33:49.677 --> 33:50.861
I don't think
that's gonna be an issue.

33:51.012 --> 33:53.513
But that's my number one.
Move.

33:53.607 --> 33:56.366
- My pet peeve
is dishes in the sink.

33:56.518 --> 33:57.868
- Okay.
- Like, I can't stand

33:58.019 --> 33:59.261
Dishes in the sink.
Like, when I lived

33:59.279 --> 34:00.929
With my brother,
he used to always leave them.

34:00.947 --> 34:02.355
And I think he expected me
to do them.

34:02.449 --> 34:03.856
And I would always do them...
- Oh.

34:03.876 --> 34:05.267
- Because I just got annoyed
with it after a while.

34:05.360 --> 34:06.209
- Because you're the nicest man
in the world.

34:06.361 --> 34:07.936
- Yeah.
So I'll admit

34:08.029 --> 34:10.955
I tend to do laundry
once a month,

34:11.050 --> 34:12.957
Typically, for me.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.885
- I do it, like, twice a week.

34:15.036 --> 34:16.444
You can do it as you want.

34:16.463 --> 34:18.055
The sheets get washed
every week, but I will--

34:18.206 --> 34:19.130
- Yeah.
- I will handle that.

34:19.283 --> 34:20.448
- Yeah, because I admit,

34:20.467 --> 34:22.559
I've been guilty
to let it go a few weeks.

34:22.786 --> 34:24.544
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

34:24.563 --> 34:26.045
And with the dogs
sleeping on there,

34:26.139 --> 34:27.289
Probably should
wash it every week.

34:27.382 --> 34:28.139
That's really something
I'm willing to--

34:28.292 --> 34:29.382
- I'll be in charge of that.

34:29.401 --> 34:30.400
That's okay.
- I mean, I'll admit it.

34:30.552 --> 34:32.736
Sometimes I can be
a little lazy.

34:32.887 --> 34:35.739
And I'm just afraid that you'll
think that I'm too lazy,

34:35.890 --> 34:37.465
And it'll be, like,
a turnoff for you.

34:37.559 --> 34:39.651
Like, just usually,
I would work,

34:39.745 --> 34:41.411
And then take the dogs
for a walk, and then come back,

34:41.563 --> 34:43.229
And maybe just kind of relax
and watch a movie.

34:43.323 --> 34:46.474
And you know, it's kind of the
same thing day in and day out,

34:46.493 --> 34:48.643
Just kind of, you know,
not having somebody.

34:48.662 --> 34:52.238
So I'm just fearful that maybe
you might find that too lazy.

34:52.332 --> 34:53.423
- If you told me you don't work

34:53.575 --> 34:54.740
And then you sit around
all day,

34:54.835 --> 34:55.926
I'd be like, lazy.

34:56.153 --> 34:57.669
But you work hard.
You should relax.

34:57.763 --> 35:00.322
And I do the same exact thing.

35:00.340 --> 35:02.340
I mean, I have this very
special chair in my apartment.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.993
And I always say
that there's a butt imprint

35:05.011 --> 35:07.437
Because some sundays,
I will just only

35:07.589 --> 35:08.772
Leave the house
to walk charlie.

35:08.923 --> 35:10.923
And I'm one with the chair
for the entire day.

35:10.943 --> 35:13.335
So I'm definitely
on the same page with you.

35:13.428 --> 35:16.095
- Yeah.
- But now, like,

35:16.189 --> 35:18.840
During the week, I feel like
it's totally fine to be "lazy."

35:18.933 --> 35:20.933
And then on the weekends
when we aren't working,

35:20.953 --> 35:23.436
We can go on more adventures
and do things

35:23.530 --> 35:25.530
And encourage each other.

I'll admit. Like,
you'll see it all the time.

37:04.781 --> 37:05.964

a little something.

37:06.058 --> 37:07.298

I mean, it's hot and sweaty

37:07.451 --> 37:08.450
Here and stuff.

37:08.543 --> 37:09.709

I like the touch.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.135

But I'm like,
when we live together--

37:16.217 --> 37:19.051
She's never lived with someone.
I've never lived with someone.

37:19.071 --> 37:21.571
- We both have a little anxiety
about moving in together

37:21.798 --> 37:23.907
Because we've never lived
with a significant other.

37:24.134 --> 37:25.909
We have three dogs.

37:26.060 --> 37:27.986
We both have
very demanding jobs.

make a decision.

No, be honest.

It's no point in lying

want to make shame of her.

to be confident in who she is,

that he lied--
