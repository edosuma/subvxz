00:01.540 --> 00:02.440
- Previously on
"Emerald City"...

00:03.100 --> 00:03.670
You were protecting those girls.

00:03.700 --> 00:05.330
- Why?
- For Glinda.

00:05.370 --> 00:06.600
You are sworn to her.
As am I.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.140
- This vortex chamber can
send you home.

00:08.180 --> 00:10.450
stop Glinda.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.620
- She gave me the only weapon

00:11.650 --> 00:12.620
that could have killed
the Witch.

00:12.650 --> 00:13.620
- Not the only one.

00:13.650 --> 00:15.350
When she gets to Glinda,

00:15.380 --> 00:16.880
she'll stop this war
before it even starts.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.360
- Randall.

00:18.390 --> 00:20.230
- I need your help.
Can I count on you

00:20.250 --> 00:22.450
to build my arsenal?

00:23.760 --> 00:26.230
- The Mother Witch lives

00:26.260 --> 00:28.620
and breathes for Glinda!

00:28.660 --> 00:30.630
- I saw young Witches.

00:30.660 --> 00:33.300
She's not going to
use them against The Beast.

00:33.330 --> 00:35.400
She's going to use them
against you.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.490
- Spread out.

00:46.510 --> 00:48.380
Every house.

00:48.420 --> 00:49.690
Every girl.

00:51.290 --> 00:52.530
Open up.

00:54.560 --> 00:55.930
- In the name of The Wizard.
- We're here by order of

00:55.960 --> 00:56.930
The Wizard.
- Open up!

00:56.960 --> 00:59.200
- Open!
- Open the door!

01:02.700 --> 01:05.540
- What are you doing?
That's my daughter!

01:10.970 --> 01:12.540
- She's an innocent child!

01:12.570 --> 01:14.440
- A plague,
carried by young girls,

01:14.480 --> 01:16.580
threatens the city.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.670
All of them must be seen
by the medic.

01:18.710 --> 01:19.980
- Mila's not sick.

01:20.010 --> 01:21.480
- That's for the medic
to decide.

01:21.520 --> 01:22.690
- Daddy, please!
Daddy!

01:22.720 --> 01:25.560
- Eamonn, Eamonn.
It's me, Miller.

01:25.590 --> 01:27.760
You know me.
Don't do this.

01:27.790 --> 01:30.560
- Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy, please!

01:30.590 --> 01:32.420
I won't let you take her.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.990
Please! Daddy!

01:36.560 --> 01:38.260
- Go to your homes.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.310
Shut the doors.

01:40.330 --> 01:42.230
Or death will come to
all of you.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.570
I have known the girl
since birth.

01:45.610 --> 01:46.580
She's no witch.

01:46.610 --> 01:48.450
- Every girl must be inspected.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.550
If Glinda's witches are hiding
in Emerald City

01:50.580 --> 01:52.820
and my people find out,

01:52.850 --> 01:55.720
I'll lose them.

01:55.750 --> 01:58.460
- You may be losing them now.
The people are scared.

01:58.490 --> 02:01.030
- Good, people don't revolt
when they're scared.

02:01.050 --> 02:04.450
They revolt when they're angry,
if they think I've lost control.

02:07.530 --> 02:10.440
- And the fate of
the High Council?

02:10.460 --> 02:12.360
What would you have me do
with them?

02:12.400 --> 02:15.300
- I haven't decided.

02:15.340 --> 02:18.810
If anyone tries to leave,
kill them.

02:25.310 --> 02:27.480
- Come on, Sylvie.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.360
- Quick stop,
and then we have to keep moving.

02:35.490 --> 02:38.760
- Look at her.
She's so free.

02:38.790 --> 02:40.620
- For the moment.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.630
- So are you.

02:42.660 --> 02:44.660
- Yes.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.370
- Although apparently
you're sworn to serve

02:46.400 --> 02:49.030
someone named Glinda.

02:49.070 --> 02:50.680
- And what about you?

02:50.700 --> 02:52.540
You're protected
by The Wizard?

02:52.570 --> 02:54.340
- He knew my parents.

02:54.380 --> 02:55.510
- Ah.

02:55.540 --> 02:58.870
- He was my first
real connection to them.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.360
You know, he's not as bad
as you think.

03:04.390 --> 03:06.560
- Apparently Glinda thinks
he's worse.

03:08.690 --> 03:11.430
- Look, Lucas,
about The Wizard...

03:11.460 --> 03:13.630
- I know, his guards
should be pursuing us,

03:13.660 --> 03:16.390
but I can't figure out
why they aren't.

03:35.420 --> 03:38.120
- I'm sorry for your loss.

03:38.150 --> 03:41.780
- He wasn't my loss.
He was my father.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.400
- I'm sorry he died.

03:44.430 --> 03:47.470
- He didn't die.
He was murdered.

03:49.700 --> 03:51.770
- It's just the more I see
of everything,

03:51.800 --> 03:54.840
the more I realize
how hard it all is for you.

03:56.740 --> 03:58.540
- Why are you talking?

03:59.910 --> 04:01.450
- I'm trying to help.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.520
- Everything you say is wrong.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.140
Everything about you is wrong.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.150
- I thought that's
why you liked me.

04:08.180 --> 04:11.380
- What about that girl
back at The Wizard's castle?

04:11.420 --> 04:13.160
Does she like you?

04:13.190 --> 04:15.930
- Tip?
No, she hates me.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.760
And so do you, it seems.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.870
- Are you pressing me
for sympathy?

04:22.900 --> 04:25.740
Yesterday, I was a princess.

04:25.770 --> 04:29.510
Today I am an orphan and a queen
all at once.

04:29.540 --> 04:31.940
What matter is it
a girl hurt your feelings?

04:31.970 --> 04:33.740
- It's more than that.

04:33.770 --> 04:35.900
Look at me.

04:35.940 --> 04:38.610
- Stop the carriage!
- Wait, why?

04:38.650 --> 04:40.690
- Leave me to feel sorry
for myself.

04:40.710 --> 04:41.940
- I meant nothing but kindness.

04:41.980 --> 04:43.910
- You missed.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.550
Oh, great, the Screaming Forest.
Thanks!

05:25.960 --> 05:28.200
- Oh, Elizabeth mentioned
a farmhouse

05:28.230 --> 05:29.640
outside of Gilliken.

05:29.660 --> 05:32.700
We should make it by dark.

05:44.950 --> 05:46.950
Oh.
- Sylvie?

05:46.980 --> 05:49.680
- Sylvie!
- Sylvie!

05:57.630 --> 05:59.700
Sylvie!

06:01.630 --> 06:03.670
Sylvie!

06:13.670 --> 06:16.810
Sylvie!

06:40.130 --> 06:42.000
- It's cruel
what they did to her,

06:42.040 --> 06:44.010
taking away her hearing.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.940
Why would the Witches do that?

06:45.970 --> 06:47.540
- Maybe to protect her.

06:47.580 --> 06:49.950
But lucky for her,
you learned a new trick.

06:49.980 --> 06:53.150
- I didn't even think about it.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.580
The gauntlets.
They...

06:55.620 --> 06:57.590
they just did something.

06:57.620 --> 06:59.590
- You can control them now.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.050
They're becoming part of you.

07:02.090 --> 07:03.760
- Maybe.

07:05.790 --> 07:09.090
Like some other things too.

07:09.130 --> 07:10.640
- The dog?

07:10.660 --> 07:12.800
- Yeah.
The dog.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.330
And Sylvie.

07:14.370 --> 07:17.080
- Ah, well, good.
I'm glad everyone's included.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.070
- They are.

07:34.990 --> 07:37.000
- I'm gonna check the house,
make sure it's safe.

07:37.020 --> 07:39.120
You keep her close until I know.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.670
- I have an idea.

07:57.140 --> 07:59.010
Do you want to play a game?

07:59.050 --> 08:02.890
It's the game I used to play
when I was your age in Kansas.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.760
It's called Somewhere.

08:05.790 --> 08:07.760
Somewhere in the meadow,

08:07.790 --> 08:10.830
there is a... scarecrow.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.940
You're good at this game.

08:18.970 --> 08:21.010
Oh, here's an easy one.

08:21.030 --> 08:23.000
Somewhere in the meadow,

08:23.040 --> 08:24.710
there's a dove.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.070
Yeah.

08:32.710 --> 08:34.740
Can you hear the birds singing?

08:37.250 --> 08:40.750
Now, I'm gonna take the things
out of your ears.

08:40.789 --> 08:43.159
It's okay.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.220
Nothing you can hear
can hurt you.

08:47.030 --> 08:49.130
Do you trust me?

08:49.160 --> 08:50.930
Okay.

08:58.110 --> 09:00.150
It's okay.
It's okay.

09:00.170 --> 09:02.070
I know it's a lot.
I know.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.170
Just focus on one thing.

09:06.710 --> 09:08.010
Focus on the dove.

09:12.820 --> 09:13.850
Come on.

09:19.230 --> 09:21.200
Can you hear it?

09:22.760 --> 09:23.890
- Dorothy?

09:31.500 --> 09:32.870
- Is something wrong
with the house?

09:32.910 --> 09:34.850
- I don't want you to get hurt.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.250
- What do you mean?

09:37.950 --> 09:39.890
- Sylvie.

09:39.910 --> 09:42.080
You're gonna have to
give her up.

09:48.990 --> 09:50.800
- Glinda.

09:53.990 --> 09:55.990
Mother.

10:01.370 --> 10:03.910
How could you lie?

10:10.180 --> 10:11.920
- I need to see your Mistress.

10:11.950 --> 10:13.350
- My mistress isn't well.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.940
- Shocking.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.350
Mistress!

10:29.100 --> 10:31.940
- No need to be shy.

10:31.970 --> 10:33.340
We have time.

10:33.370 --> 10:36.840
With looks like yours,
it takes very little.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.200
- Then you mustn't be
very good.

10:39.240 --> 10:42.180
- Give me a whore
with an attitude.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.990
- I'm not that kind of girl.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.020
- Mistress West.

10:59.060 --> 11:00.330
Come on.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.960
- Come on.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.240
- I've quarantined
all the girls in the city

11:04.260 --> 11:05.790
within age,

11:05.830 --> 11:07.960
and I need for you to come...

11:08.000 --> 11:09.060
- Mistress, get up.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.270
- And single out witches
among them.

11:11.300 --> 11:13.070
- Come.
- You're still here.

11:13.110 --> 11:14.380
- Yeah, I'm still here.

11:14.410 --> 11:17.250
Come on.
There you go.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.920
There we go.

11:18.950 --> 11:20.950
Give The Wizard an answer.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.350
- I won't help you kill them.

11:25.390 --> 11:26.990
- No, not me.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.820
I've never killed a single witch
in my life.

11:29.860 --> 11:31.060
Glinda has.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.320
Nearly all of them.

11:32.360 --> 11:35.370
She sent them to die
against The Beast Forever.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.090
And I helped her.

11:41.630 --> 11:43.400
I killed them too.

11:46.340 --> 11:50.220
I won't help either of you
repeat the past.

11:59.090 --> 12:03.200
Glinda hid your mother
from you.

12:03.220 --> 12:04.290
- Yes.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.890
- She built an army of witches

12:05.930 --> 12:08.970
on secrets

12:09.000 --> 12:10.970
and lies.

12:12.270 --> 12:14.370
- Do you have a family?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.970
- Yes, I...

12:17.000 --> 12:20.970
Yes.
They're all cheaters and liars.

12:22.010 --> 12:25.080
- But all you have.

12:25.110 --> 12:27.080
- Now, Glinda,
she's willing to sacrifice

12:27.110 --> 12:29.080
all of those little girls

12:29.120 --> 12:32.490
just like the last time.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.390
But me...

12:35.420 --> 12:38.390
I want to help you save them.

12:38.430 --> 12:39.930
- Mm.

12:45.500 --> 12:48.470
If... I find them...

12:51.140 --> 12:53.180
You give them to me,

12:53.210 --> 12:55.480
to my care,

12:55.510 --> 12:59.680
with a promise to protect them
from whatever comes.

12:59.710 --> 13:03.280
- Yes.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.090
I give you my word.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.490
- Why mix?

13:18.530 --> 13:20.400
- The vegetables?

13:20.430 --> 13:22.500
I don't know.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.240
I guess
it's what makes a good stew.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.700
The more the merrier.

13:26.740 --> 13:29.180
Um...

13:29.210 --> 13:30.480
cook.

13:43.420 --> 13:45.450
You're right about Sylvie.

13:49.100 --> 13:51.740
I don't want to give her up.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.230
- She's Glinda's.

13:54.270 --> 13:57.140
- Glinda isn't even her mother.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.130
She's just a stranger
we know nothing about.

13:59.170 --> 14:02.170
- I know, but this is
what was planned for her.

14:02.210 --> 14:04.320
- And who gets to decide that
for anyone?

14:06.380 --> 14:08.420
- It's the way the world works.

14:19.260 --> 14:22.230
- What if we decide to
keep her from Glinda?

14:22.260 --> 14:24.260
Protect her?

14:26.200 --> 14:28.510
- I thought we were
on the same side here.

14:28.540 --> 14:31.040
- Do you want her fighting
in a war that could kill her?

14:31.070 --> 14:32.030
- No, of course not.

14:32.070 --> 14:34.100
- Then we are on the same side.

14:36.540 --> 14:38.510
- Are we?

15:10.540 --> 15:13.480
- None of them witches.

15:13.510 --> 15:15.410
- How can you be certain?

15:15.450 --> 15:18.620
- When you find one,

15:18.650 --> 15:20.420
you'll know.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.330
- Come here.
- Come here, you.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.210
- You see her back there?

16:12.240 --> 16:14.250
- Checked over there...

17:17.839 --> 17:19.240
Rust.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.780
Help!
Help!

17:27.810 --> 17:30.180
Help!

17:36.560 --> 17:38.700
- You have mother?

17:38.730 --> 17:41.570
- Um... yes.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.730
But I don't know her.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.630
- Then who?

17:48.670 --> 17:52.310
- Um...
my Aunt Em is like my mom.

17:53.770 --> 17:56.500
She loves me just as much,
and I love her.

17:58.780 --> 18:00.650
Do you have a mother?

18:02.880 --> 18:04.910
You'll find her someday.

18:06.690 --> 18:08.860
But until then,
you're not alone.

18:13.030 --> 18:14.800
Sweet dreams.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.900
- Is she asleep?

18:25.940 --> 18:27.910
- She will be soon.

18:31.780 --> 18:33.550
- Good.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.280
Well, I have first watch.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.920
- You've been first-watching
all day.

18:43.690 --> 18:46.250
I can't let you do this.

18:47.830 --> 18:49.300
- I'm fine.

18:49.330 --> 18:51.800
- No.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.800
The Wizard guards,
they're not coming.

18:56.670 --> 18:57.980
- What?
- They're not coming

18:58.000 --> 19:00.970
because The Wizard let us go.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.720
- Why?

19:04.740 --> 19:08.340
- He wants to help me.

19:08.380 --> 19:09.980
- So you lied to me?

19:10.020 --> 19:12.990
- Yes.
I lied.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.950
I lied because...
if you're with Glinda,

19:17.990 --> 19:19.890
if you fight for her,

19:19.930 --> 19:22.770
we're not on the same side.

19:28.340 --> 19:32.410
- There's only one person
I fight for

19:32.440 --> 19:34.710
since the moment we met.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.840
And you for me.

19:41.350 --> 19:43.320
Remember?

20:08.480 --> 20:09.710
- Who made it out?

20:09.740 --> 20:11.970
- None.
Two of ours were inside.

20:12.010 --> 20:13.910
And the girl.

20:16.750 --> 20:18.420
- Then she's dead,

20:18.450 --> 20:20.950
and we don't need Mistress West.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.460
She's gone.

20:27.030 --> 20:30.000
- Not if she's a witch.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.770
- Wait.
Can you really do this,

20:38.810 --> 20:41.710
or is it
some kind of death wish?

20:41.740 --> 20:43.140
Mistress?

20:58.530 --> 20:59.860
She's alive.

21:05.830 --> 21:07.430
- She's a witch.

21:07.470 --> 21:10.810
- Bring the carriage.
Get these people out of here!

21:13.540 --> 21:15.070
- Aah!

21:15.110 --> 21:16.780
- What is this?

21:16.810 --> 21:18.680
- I have to protect my people.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.740
- By locking her up
like an animal?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.740
- I'm not leaving this
to chance.

21:22.780 --> 21:25.010
They can see her.
Grab her!

21:28.150 --> 21:30.450
- Aah!

21:41.830 --> 21:42.930
- Liar!

21:54.910 --> 21:56.080
- Keep them back.

21:56.120 --> 21:57.860
No one gets through.

22:02.590 --> 22:03.830
- We need to go now!

22:03.860 --> 22:05.130
We need to move!

22:05.160 --> 22:06.160
Block off the streets.

22:06.190 --> 22:08.820
You!
Come with me now!

22:08.860 --> 22:10.960
Or my people will rip you apart!

22:12.500 --> 22:14.010
- You stole our daughters!

22:14.030 --> 22:16.530
- Liar!
- You're a fraud!

22:16.570 --> 22:18.740
- You promised to protect her!

22:18.770 --> 22:21.200
- You should have secured her
when you had the chance.

22:21.240 --> 22:24.870
- I had her, and then
you scared her with that cage.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.070
I'm going back for her.

22:26.110 --> 22:27.540
- You will not!

22:27.580 --> 22:29.910
Your hands are tied,
as are mine.

22:29.950 --> 22:31.790
- You can't just leave her!

22:33.090 --> 22:36.060
Fraud! Fraud! Fraud! Fraud!

22:46.930 --> 22:48.900
- I left her behind.

22:48.940 --> 22:52.240
I made her feel safe,
and I left her.

22:52.270 --> 22:54.840
That's how I killed
all my sisters.

22:54.870 --> 22:57.640
I took away their fear.

22:57.680 --> 23:02.220
I gave them milk of the poppy
to make them forget their pain,

23:02.250 --> 23:05.220
and then I sent them out
to fight.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.210
And none returned.

23:09.990 --> 23:11.960
Because of me.

23:14.290 --> 23:16.960
And now...

23:17.000 --> 23:19.600
I've betrayed another.

24:09.050 --> 24:11.220
- I knew you couldn't be so mean
to leave me here.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.650
- But I am.

24:13.690 --> 24:15.690
I did.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.690
- Are you gonna help me or not?

24:26.770 --> 24:28.240
What's that?

24:28.270 --> 24:29.910
- Wheeler tree sap.

24:29.940 --> 24:32.280
Some of my masks have
moving parts.

24:32.300 --> 24:35.340
Grease things up,
get them moving...

24:37.080 --> 24:38.980
Since you've stopped.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.310
- Uh-uh.

24:41.350 --> 24:43.220
- I could leave your screams
to the forest

24:43.250 --> 24:44.860
and the things that go bump
in it.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.380
- Stop!

24:49.890 --> 24:51.400
All right, do it.

25:14.850 --> 25:16.720
- Top done.

25:16.750 --> 25:18.290
Bottom time.

25:21.950 --> 25:24.750
- Give me your word

25:24.790 --> 25:26.990
not to go
anywhere you shouldn't.

25:27.030 --> 25:29.800
- I give my word

25:29.830 --> 25:31.700
as a lady.

25:33.130 --> 25:35.400
- C-c-cold.

25:38.470 --> 25:41.770
Oh... you gave your word.

25:41.810 --> 25:44.720
As a lady.

25:44.740 --> 25:48.410
- But I am queen now.

25:48.450 --> 25:49.920
- Okay.

25:59.860 --> 26:01.970
- There.
Done.

26:01.990 --> 26:04.830
- What?

26:04.860 --> 26:06.890
Really?

26:06.930 --> 26:08.900
- You tell me.

26:28.350 --> 26:31.790
- Everything's working properly,
then.

26:31.820 --> 26:33.720
- Yeah.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.360
It is.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.480
- So what do we do now?

27:02.150 --> 27:03.420
- More of that?

27:07.130 --> 27:10.170
We could if we stayed.

27:11.800 --> 27:15.870
Screw the witches,
and damn The Beast.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.100
We could
batten down the hatches here

27:17.140 --> 27:19.140
and take care of each other.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.750
- I wish I could
have that wish.

27:30.180 --> 27:32.850
I've never been this happy.

27:35.190 --> 27:38.060
Your face doesn't seem
to know it just yet.

27:41.230 --> 27:43.430
- I'm going home.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.110
- Yeah.
Someday.

27:48.130 --> 27:49.500
But until we figure out...

27:49.540 --> 27:52.010
- No.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.440
Soon.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.550
If I can convince Glinda

27:57.580 --> 27:59.150
to not go to war
with The Wizard,

27:59.180 --> 28:01.190
The Wizard can take me home.

28:01.210 --> 28:03.480
He knows how.

28:05.620 --> 28:08.030
- You made a deal with him?

28:08.050 --> 28:10.050
- Yeah.

28:10.090 --> 28:12.560
A deal that saved us both.

28:14.060 --> 28:17.190
- How... how could you let Sylvie
love you

28:17.230 --> 28:18.570
if you knew you were leaving?

28:18.600 --> 28:21.070
How could you let me?

28:21.100 --> 28:23.970
- If you're on my side,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.970
you'll stay here
and keep her safe.

28:29.210 --> 28:31.080
- What?

28:33.080 --> 28:34.450
Where are you going?

28:34.480 --> 28:36.040
- To face Glinda.

28:37.650 --> 28:40.190
- Now?
Are you insane?

28:40.220 --> 28:42.890
What... without even saying
good-bye?

28:42.920 --> 28:44.520
- I can't.
You'll explain.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.630
- No.
No, I won't.

28:46.660 --> 28:48.570
- I can't let an innocent girl

28:48.590 --> 28:51.590
fight a war
she knows nothing about.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.930
This is for her.

28:53.970 --> 28:56.970
- What exactly
are you gonna do here?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.600
You're just gonna reason
with a Cardinal Witch?

28:58.640 --> 29:00.610
- Whatever it takes.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.080
Kill her if I have to.

29:02.110 --> 29:04.950
- Words without point, Dorothy.

29:04.980 --> 29:07.620
You don't know what opposes you
or how to stop it.

29:07.650 --> 29:09.950
- I haven't known that
since I got here.

29:09.980 --> 29:13.510
- Why can't you
just be honest here?

29:13.550 --> 29:17.620
You're afraid of what this is...
Us, me...

29:17.660 --> 29:20.630
that we're all gonna leave you,
just because your mother did.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.090
- No.

29:23.130 --> 29:25.300
- So you're not running away?

29:25.330 --> 29:30.230
Leaving us to lose you,
just like Em and Henry?

29:30.270 --> 29:32.240
- I have to go back.

29:35.710 --> 29:39.220
I'm sorry.

29:39.250 --> 29:41.650
But they came first.

29:51.220 --> 29:53.520
It's locked.
Why is this locked?

29:56.560 --> 29:58.360
Lucas!

29:58.400 --> 29:59.370
- Whoa!

29:59.400 --> 30:01.140
- Lucas!

30:01.170 --> 30:04.110
Sylvie!

30:04.140 --> 30:05.340
What's happening?

30:05.370 --> 30:06.530
- I don't know!

30:06.570 --> 30:08.340
- Sylvie, hang on!

30:21.150 --> 30:21.420
- Sylvie!

30:26.260 --> 30:27.630
- Sylvie!

30:34.300 --> 30:36.400
Where's Sylvie?

30:36.440 --> 30:38.140
Where's Sylvie?

30:47.580 --> 30:50.290
Sylvie?
Sylvie?

30:54.150 --> 30:55.420
Sylvie?

30:58.460 --> 30:59.600
She's the one doing this.

30:59.630 --> 31:02.430
- Why?

31:02.460 --> 31:04.530
- She heard us fighting.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.590
She's stopping me from leaving.

31:09.170 --> 31:11.140
Sylvie, come on.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.300
I'm right here.

31:12.340 --> 31:13.680
I'm not going anywhere.

31:13.710 --> 31:15.510
I promise you.

31:17.380 --> 31:21.450
Maybe... maybe there's a way
we can all three stay together.

31:24.480 --> 31:27.180
Would you like to come to Kansas
with me?

31:28.390 --> 31:29.590
- Somewhere.

31:29.620 --> 31:32.350
- Yeah.
We can play Somewhere.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.000
It's not running away
if you come too.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.630
- I'm the man of the house,
aren't I?

32:18.440 --> 32:21.550
- My father's suite.

32:21.570 --> 32:23.540
They've made it mine.

32:23.580 --> 32:25.420
- It's nice.

32:44.460 --> 32:47.630
- When I was younger,
I used to play with his crown.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.430
Put it on my head.

32:54.810 --> 32:56.680
But it was just a game.

32:59.610 --> 33:01.640
It's not what I wanted.

33:08.290 --> 33:09.760
No.
Please stay.

33:25.900 --> 33:30.300
My father was the only one
to see me as I truly am.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.540
I need someone to see me now.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.440
- Wait.

33:39.590 --> 33:41.630
You don't have to do that.

33:45.390 --> 33:46.820
I do see you.

34:25.500 --> 34:26.969
- I've lied to you...

34:27.000 --> 34:28.570
All of you...

34:28.600 --> 34:30.630
About your daughters.

34:32.500 --> 34:35.469
And for that, I am ashamed.

34:35.510 --> 34:38.449
I am deeply ashamed.

34:56.929 --> 35:01.670
- I thought that
I could control magic,

35:01.700 --> 35:05.470
but magic can not be controlled.

35:05.500 --> 35:08.470
It must be extinguished.

35:13.410 --> 35:14.840
Last night,

35:14.880 --> 35:16.610
the ones closest to me

35:16.650 --> 35:19.620
made the ultimate sacrifice.

35:20.690 --> 35:22.660
My beloved council...

35:28.060 --> 35:29.800
- It was only me!

35:29.830 --> 35:32.600
I alone was Glinda's spy!

35:32.630 --> 35:33.930
The rest are innocent.

35:33.970 --> 35:36.940
Anna loved you.

35:36.970 --> 35:39.410
- They have given their lives

35:39.440 --> 35:41.880
trying to apprehend this threat.

35:57.460 --> 36:01.500
At least now,
we know the hard truth.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.560
Witches are The Beast Forever.

36:56.050 --> 36:58.360
- You were too young.

36:58.380 --> 37:00.880
The Wizard exhausted your magic.

37:05.590 --> 37:08.090
- It may be more merciful
to use this.

37:09.560 --> 37:10.960
- I break my vow...

37:12.530 --> 37:15.000
- To ease your suffering.

37:18.140 --> 37:19.880
Forgive me.

37:27.950 --> 37:30.120
You're free, my child.

38:01.950 --> 38:03.490
Where'd you get that from?

38:03.520 --> 38:05.420
- It's mine.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.010
- That's not true.

38:07.050 --> 38:10.080
- I took it from the place
where I grew up.

38:12.190 --> 38:15.090
- The crest is
King Pastoria's...

38:15.130 --> 38:18.570
handed down to his daughter
at birth.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.100
- His daughter?

38:20.130 --> 38:22.100
- The Princess.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.900
Ozma.

38:33.950 --> 38:35.990
We're here, Dorothy.

38:36.010 --> 38:37.510
And we're not going any further

38:37.550 --> 38:39.460
until you figure out
what you're doing.

38:39.490 --> 38:41.890
- The gauntlets.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.650
- You'll use them
against Glinda.

38:43.690 --> 38:45.500
- I can control them

38:45.520 --> 38:47.690
if I want something
badly enough.

38:47.730 --> 38:49.470
- So, if you have to kill Glinda
to get home,

38:49.500 --> 38:50.930
they should work.

39:07.180 --> 39:09.520
Stay, Toto.

40:01.100 --> 40:03.610
- We've come to see
the Witch of the North...

40:05.640 --> 40:08.610
Sent by Elizabeth
of The Wizard's High Council.

40:09.780 --> 40:11.750
- Glinda knows me.

40:13.580 --> 40:14.720
- Not this one.

40:14.750 --> 40:16.090
- She's with me.

40:16.110 --> 40:19.750
- That won't be necessary.

40:24.090 --> 40:27.630
Roan.

40:27.660 --> 40:30.700
Young lady, I'm grateful
for what you've done.

40:32.300 --> 40:36.270
You've returned
two very important people to me.

40:36.300 --> 40:40.130
- I'm not returning them.

40:40.170 --> 40:42.570
Lucas and Sylvie decide
for themselves.

40:42.610 --> 40:44.720
- Are those the names
you've given them?

40:44.740 --> 40:47.240
How sweet.

40:47.280 --> 40:50.720
There are many questions,
to be sure.

40:52.750 --> 40:57.220
But let me begin
to offer answers.

41:18.140 --> 41:19.810
- Glinda.

41:21.850 --> 41:23.620
- Lucas?

41:25.650 --> 41:27.010
Lucas?

41:30.060 --> 41:32.030
That's not my name.

41:43.670 --> 41:46.410
I return to our fight
against The Wizard.

41:48.440 --> 41:52.320
I seek leniency for Dorothy,

41:52.340 --> 41:55.310
a healer who spared my life
at Nimbo,

41:55.350 --> 41:57.790
among countless other times.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.410
Even...

42:01.450 --> 42:04.420
even if she was sent
by The Wizard to kill you.

42:07.730 --> 42:10.700
I'm sorry, Dorothy...

42:12.360 --> 42:14.860
But they came first.
