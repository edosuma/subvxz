WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:02.655
Who are you?

00:02.757 --> 00:04.225
Helen, you look beautiful.

00:04.937 --> 00:06.437
<i>Previously on</i> Sanctuary <i>...</i>

00:06.957 --> 00:07.890
How do you know me?

00:07.891 --> 00:09.292
How indeed?

00:09.344 --> 00:11.913
I've waited
a long time for this.

00:12.663 --> 00:13.896
Adam...

00:13.897 --> 00:15.164
Who the hell is this guy?

00:15.165 --> 00:16.532
Not one person,
but two.

00:18.435 --> 00:21.537
Prepare to meet
Jekyll and Hyde.

00:21.538 --> 00:23.539
You don't need us.

00:23.540 --> 00:25.708
No, you don't see, you need me.

00:25.709 --> 00:27.009
You need me!

00:27.010 --> 00:28.945
I'm afraid
there's nothing I can do.

00:28.946 --> 00:31.380
But you've done experiments
with blood injections before,

00:31.381 --> 00:32.615
rare blood
with amazing properties.

00:32.616 --> 00:33.516
Not on a child.

00:33.517 --> 00:35.017
She's my daughter.

00:35.018 --> 00:37.453
You have
my condolences.

00:38.622 --> 00:40.556
Your only legacy

00:40.557 --> 00:41.757
will be that you murdered me.

00:41.758 --> 00:43.459
Adam, don't!

00:43.460 --> 00:45.595
No!

00:45.596 --> 00:48.030
How did you survive?

00:48.031 --> 00:50.433
I was taken to the city.

00:50.434 --> 00:52.101
They treated me
as one of their own,

00:52.102 --> 00:54.770
showed me things
you can't even imagine.

00:54.771 --> 00:56.439
At this rate,

00:56.440 --> 00:57.773
he'll experience
complete organ failure

00:57.774 --> 00:58.741
and be dead
within a matter of weeks.

00:58.742 --> 01:00.142
That's not Adam's blood.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.477
It's yours.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.546
One of the unfortunate
side effects

01:03.547 --> 01:06.182
of traveling through
an extra-dimensional rift.

01:06.183 --> 01:08.517
Keystones!
What are they?

01:08.518 --> 01:09.785
How do they lead
to the city?

01:09.786 --> 01:11.587
If you want to save Gregory,
you need me!

01:11.588 --> 01:12.989
My father
never gave me a gift

01:12.990 --> 01:14.724
without significance.

01:14.725 --> 01:16.158
Do you think
it exists?

01:16.159 --> 01:17.760
Well, if it does,
we have to find it.

01:20.063 --> 01:20.897
The keystone....

01:20.898 --> 01:24.667
The last piece
of the puzzle.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.402
That's the gateway.

01:26.403 --> 01:28.004
We leave at first light.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.041
So you've found it.

01:32.042 --> 01:34.110
The real keystone.

01:34.111 --> 01:36.746
I'll bring back the cure.

01:36.747 --> 01:38.848
If you're telling the truth
and it actually exists.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.017
If I lied, we're both dead.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.586
Yes, and you're
far too arrogant

01:43.587 --> 01:44.587
to commit suicide.

01:44.588 --> 01:46.422
Bravo.

01:46.423 --> 01:47.590
I can lead you to it,
you know.

01:47.591 --> 01:49.558
You're not going anywhere.

01:49.559 --> 01:52.061
But 'dere be tigers down dere.

01:52.062 --> 01:53.863
Far too dangerous without me.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.464
On the contrary.

01:55.465 --> 01:56.899
Come on, Helen.

01:56.900 --> 01:59.969
Devil you know, and all that?

01:59.970 --> 02:02.004
You'll never survive
on your own, you know.

02:02.005 --> 02:04.874
Maybe you don't
want to.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.175
Death of a child...

02:11.181 --> 02:12.982
Hmm.

02:12.983 --> 02:15.084
Never quite the same
after that, is it?

02:22.793 --> 02:24.160
I'm just saying,

02:24.161 --> 02:25.928
we're betting the bank
on the word of a nutbar.

02:25.929 --> 02:26.796
None of you
has to come.

02:26.797 --> 02:28.130
Gregory is my father.

02:28.131 --> 02:29.198
You're sick.

02:29.199 --> 02:30.266
You're not
going alone.

02:30.267 --> 02:31.534
Yeah,
what he said.

02:31.535 --> 02:33.769
Absolutely.

02:33.770 --> 02:35.604
I've been testing this
vampire shield all morning--

02:35.605 --> 02:37.173
you're really
not very good at

02:37.174 --> 02:38.474
naming things,
are you?

02:38.475 --> 02:39.875
Too bad
our resident genius

02:39.876 --> 02:41.344
could only make one.

02:41.345 --> 02:42.712
Really, the paltry
supplies of lathanides

02:42.713 --> 02:43.846
you keep on hand?

02:43.847 --> 02:45.214
I'll be careful
with that, I promise.

02:45.215 --> 02:46.749
Oh, so you're going?

02:46.750 --> 02:48.684
As opposed to..?

02:48.685 --> 02:49.885
You? Or him?

02:49.886 --> 02:51.887
I did aid in
procuring the keystone.

02:51.888 --> 02:52.922
Found the gateway!

02:52.923 --> 02:53.990
Hand it over.

02:55.692 --> 02:57.460
Very well,

02:57.461 --> 02:59.161
but, really,
I have to say,

02:59.162 --> 03:01.897
when I imagine the splendor
of the entry hall,

03:01.898 --> 03:05.768
an architectural site
thousands of years old...

03:05.769 --> 03:07.470
A veritable marvel

03:07.471 --> 03:08.671
of art and design,

03:08.672 --> 03:10.172
and to think

03:10.173 --> 03:11.474
that the first witnesses
to this spectacle

03:11.475 --> 03:12.942
will be Huey,
Dewey, and Screwy?

03:12.943 --> 03:13.943
Really, Helen,

03:13.944 --> 03:16.012
my heart sinks
you chose them over me.

03:16.013 --> 03:17.613
Don't be bitter.

03:18.749 --> 03:19.782
I do it so well.

03:20.851 --> 03:22.018
Sooner the better.

03:22.019 --> 03:23.152
Ready when you are.

03:23.153 --> 03:24.687
Oh, man,
I hate this...

03:26.023 --> 03:27.723
I have to pee.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.163
Best zip up.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.840
Let me come with you!

03:44.841 --> 03:45.941
Without a source blood shield,

03:45.942 --> 03:47.977
you could be
a liability.

03:47.978 --> 03:51.647
Before we go any further,
you need to leave.

03:53.216 --> 03:54.784
Set up the repeater.

03:54.785 --> 03:57.186
Keep that tracking system
broadcasting!

03:57.187 --> 03:58.854
Yeah!

03:58.855 --> 03:59.789
I'm on it, I just--

04:00.724 --> 04:03.059
Hmm.

04:03.060 --> 04:05.061
Here goes nothing!

04:07.000 --> 04:13.074

04:24.081 --> 04:26.344

04:43.810 --> 04:44.433
Will you
tuck me in?

04:44.631 --> 04:45.765
No.

04:45.766 --> 04:47.366
Although I could add
some sulphuric acid

04:47.367 --> 04:48.634
to this cocktail,

04:48.635 --> 04:49.869
make your blood boil
from the inside.

04:49.870 --> 04:51.103
Would you like that?

04:51.104 --> 04:52.672
You haven't lost
your sense of humor.

04:54.074 --> 04:57.910
She's going to die
down there, you know that.

04:57.911 --> 04:59.512
There will be <i> events</i>

04:59.513 --> 05:01.414
she's unprepared for.

05:01.415 --> 05:02.615
Finish up.

05:02.616 --> 05:03.783
I'm sick of
the sound of his voice.

05:03.784 --> 05:06.986
The great
Helen Magnus.

05:06.987 --> 05:08.054
Oh well, I tried to warn her.

05:08.055 --> 05:09.989
Stop!

05:09.990 --> 05:12.925
Talking.

05:12.926 --> 05:17.864
She never loved you,
you know that.

05:18.899 --> 05:19.832
Oh, come on,

05:19.833 --> 05:20.833
you've seen the way
she looks at me,

05:20.834 --> 05:22.969
with pity in her eyes.

05:22.970 --> 05:25.104
Why should she feel
any differently about you?

05:25.105 --> 05:27.740
The only reason
she tolerates you

05:27.741 --> 05:29.075
is because
she can use you,

05:29.076 --> 05:30.676
like a mad dog on a leash,

05:30.677 --> 05:33.613
and you just keep
lapping at her heels

05:33.614 --> 05:34.847
like the pathetic
little pet that you are--

05:37.518 --> 05:38.417
John, really...

05:39.987 --> 05:41.487
He's not worth it,
pardon the pun.

05:41.488 --> 05:43.089
If you kill him,

05:43.090 --> 05:45.591
he can't help her.

05:55.002 --> 05:56.035
Same old Johnny.

05:57.704 --> 05:58.771
Please.

06:12.986 --> 06:14.453
Ice blocking
the door!

06:16.056 --> 06:18.124
This may take a while!

06:21.895 --> 06:25.064
Henry, do you have
a cutting torch?

06:25.065 --> 06:26.732
Yeah!

06:26.733 --> 06:28.467
Uh...
Oh boy.

06:28.468 --> 06:29.502
Um...

06:29.503 --> 06:30.937
Ah-ha!

06:36.743 --> 06:38.744
Kate, I need the first aid kit!

06:38.745 --> 06:42.014
Pass me
the disinfectant spray.

06:47.788 --> 06:48.788
I need you guys
to get behind me

06:48.789 --> 06:50.156
and block the wind.

07:03.704 --> 07:04.837
Aw...

07:04.838 --> 07:06.072
I'm running out of juice!

07:06.073 --> 07:08.040
Kate, help me keep pressure
on the door.

07:16.550 --> 07:18.718
I'm dyin' here!

07:20.554 --> 07:21.654
Whoa! What is that?

07:21.655 --> 07:22.955
An earth tremor!

07:39.840 --> 07:41.807
Well done!

07:46.980 --> 07:49.649
Eeny, meeny, miny...

07:49.650 --> 07:51.117
There goes mo.

07:58.692 --> 08:02.728
I wonder if Gregory
ever passed through here?

08:03.630 --> 08:05.331
Oh, no.

08:05.332 --> 08:06.799
Come on...

08:10.804 --> 08:12.238
Pull!

08:13.807 --> 08:14.707
Look out, fingers!

08:16.810 --> 08:18.944
I said pull.

08:18.945 --> 08:20.613
It's a stone wall!

08:21.982 --> 08:24.183
Well, at least we're inside,

08:24.184 --> 08:25.785
where it's warm.

08:25.786 --> 08:27.853
I'm assuming
this cave system

08:27.854 --> 08:29.789
must somehow
lead to the city.

08:29.790 --> 08:31.991
Hey...

08:37.898 --> 08:39.932
It's not glass.

08:39.933 --> 08:42.702
Definitely
quartz-based.

08:42.703 --> 08:44.035
Electronic eye
of some sort?

08:44.037 --> 08:45.538
Yeah, and we tripped it
on the way in.

08:45.539 --> 08:46.939
Triggered an autolock.

08:46.940 --> 08:47.873
Well, that's great,
but how do we get back out?

08:49.176 --> 08:50.576
Doesn't matter.

08:50.577 --> 08:51.811
We're moving forward.

08:55.182 --> 08:59.752
Ah, and what have we here?

09:03.223 --> 09:04.290
Light switch?

09:07.728 --> 09:09.161
" <i>Akhkharu</i> ."

09:09.162 --> 09:10.629
Vampire detector.

09:12.165 --> 09:15.034
Well, all the major airports
have 'em these days.

09:16.069 --> 09:17.336
How's your gizmo?

09:17.337 --> 09:18.537
Well, the light's on.

09:18.538 --> 09:19.939
Universal sign

09:19.940 --> 09:21.207
that a source blood shield
is working, right?

09:21.208 --> 09:23.843
Guess there's only
one way to find out.

09:23.844 --> 09:25.111
Whoa, whoa.

09:25.112 --> 09:27.847
Maybe you should
let us go first.

09:27.848 --> 09:29.682
If it senses
three non-vampires,

09:29.683 --> 09:32.084
it might go easy on you.

09:32.085 --> 09:33.753
All right.

09:36.790 --> 09:39.725
Yeah, sure.

09:49.836 --> 09:51.670
You're clear.

10:08.688 --> 10:10.055
Henry.

10:16.096 --> 10:18.063
Clear.

10:18.064 --> 10:20.399
My turn.

10:29.176 --> 10:31.310
Oh, come on, Nikola...

10:40.287 --> 10:41.821
I take back everything
I've ever said about the guy.

10:41.822 --> 10:43.389
Let's not be too hasty.

10:44.457 --> 10:45.424
Whoa.

10:45.425 --> 10:47.092
As I was saying.

10:47.093 --> 10:48.160
Whoa,
what did I do?

10:48.161 --> 10:49.161
Whoa, whoa!

10:49.162 --> 10:49.929
They're after
all of us.

10:49.930 --> 10:51.063
Oh, no,
you don't.

11:03.009 --> 11:07.246
Henry! Kate!

11:10.050 --> 11:11.183
Bloody hell.

11:17.528 --> 11:18.761
You're sitting on my leg.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.697
Argh, your foot
is in my throat!

11:20.698 --> 11:21.731
Oh.

11:25.536 --> 11:26.669
Henry?

11:27.705 --> 11:28.538
Kate!

11:28.539 --> 11:29.639
Without the repeater,

11:29.640 --> 11:32.709
the signal won't
penetrate solid rock.

11:32.710 --> 11:34.043
What is this thing?

11:34.044 --> 11:37.480
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

11:44.455 --> 11:48.091
Oh, great,
now we made it mad.

11:48.092 --> 11:50.893
It's herding us
down this tunnel.

11:50.894 --> 11:52.462
Like cattle in a chute.

11:52.463 --> 11:54.697
Oh, that never
ends well.

11:56.533 --> 11:59.535
I hope Henry and Kate
fare better than us.

12:00.938 --> 12:02.271
How'd you do that?

12:02.272 --> 12:06.175
Oh, you know, earthquake,
rock slide,

12:06.176 --> 12:08.911
plunge down
a 20-foot shaft,

12:08.912 --> 12:10.546
you take your pick.

12:10.547 --> 12:11.614
We really ought to
take a look at it.

12:11.615 --> 12:12.582
Right now
I'm more interested in

12:12.583 --> 12:13.983
finding our tracking device.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.918
And the repeaters.

12:15.919 --> 12:17.553
At least they can
locate our signal,

12:17.554 --> 12:18.855
maybe send a rescue...

12:20.657 --> 12:22.191
Aw, man...

12:22.192 --> 12:24.460
What?

12:24.461 --> 12:25.762
Aw...

12:26.997 --> 12:28.131
Their tracking
signal...

12:28.132 --> 12:29.165
It died a few minutes ago.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.167
Some sort of network error?

12:31.168 --> 12:33.035
I don't think so.
I've rebooted the entire system.

12:33.036 --> 12:35.171
Then she needs help.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.439
Not so fast.

12:36.440 --> 12:37.807
There could be any number
of reasons

12:37.808 --> 12:38.608
why the signal died.

12:38.609 --> 12:39.876
Such as?

12:39.877 --> 12:41.811
I don't know, a malfunction
in the vampire shield?

12:41.812 --> 12:43.613
Just give me
a few minutes.

12:43.614 --> 12:44.714
I'd like to
check something.

12:46.517 --> 12:47.917
It is rather
incredible, isn't it?

12:47.918 --> 12:48.751
Yeah.

12:48.752 --> 12:49.886
I mean, to think

12:49.887 --> 12:50.887
we might be among
the first surface humans

12:50.888 --> 12:52.688
to walk this ground
in decades,

12:52.689 --> 12:54.524
centuries, even.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.459
What if this
is the source

12:56.460 --> 12:57.794
for all abnormals,

12:57.795 --> 12:59.028
both beneath
and above the surface?

12:59.029 --> 13:01.230
That's a real
game-changer.

13:01.231 --> 13:02.465
Imagine the impact
it would have

13:02.466 --> 13:03.633
on everything,

13:03.634 --> 13:05.067
on our research,
our experiments,

13:05.068 --> 13:06.536
everything
we thought we knew.

13:06.537 --> 13:07.570
It could change
the Sanctuary project

13:07.571 --> 13:08.704
forever.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.039
That is, if we find
our way out of here.

13:16.780 --> 13:17.847
It must be
centuries old.

13:23.086 --> 13:26.255
Ancient steel,
that's reassuring.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.693
Yup, that is
a long way down.

13:30.694 --> 13:32.662
Up ahead here, mind the gap.

13:37.835 --> 13:40.603
Taken out by a rock slide.

13:40.604 --> 13:42.872
It's okay,
we can jump that easily.

13:45.843 --> 13:48.077
Yes, but
do we want to?

13:48.078 --> 13:51.147
Do you have
a plan B?

13:51.148 --> 13:53.282
Follow my lead.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.491
What?

14:22.079 --> 14:22.979
Of course.

14:22.980 --> 14:24.013
Now what?

14:27.851 --> 14:30.253
Hang on!

14:42.099 --> 14:43.599
Good times.

14:46.251 --> 14:47.373
Is that
a defense satellite

14:47.441 --> 14:48.375
you've stolen?

14:48.399 --> 14:49.336
Weather.

14:49.436 --> 14:51.304
Better
geothermal data.

14:52.280 --> 14:53.847
Look here.

14:53.848 --> 14:56.983
A seismic event of 3.4
was registered right at...

14:56.984 --> 14:58.451
The same coordinates
as the gateway.

14:58.452 --> 15:00.787
At roughly the same time
as their tracking signal died.

15:20.408 --> 15:21.908
They made it inside,

15:21.909 --> 15:23.310
but the gateway
is sealed again.

15:27.481 --> 15:29.849
Thank you, Will.

15:29.850 --> 15:32.252
No problem.

15:34.956 --> 15:36.890
We should probably
follow the laser field.

15:36.891 --> 15:38.258
It might be headed
to the city.

15:38.259 --> 15:39.626
Hold on, hold on,
you need to rest.

15:39.627 --> 15:41.228
I'm fine.

15:41.229 --> 15:42.829
That's the adrenaline
talking.

15:42.830 --> 15:45.665
Yes, well,
any port in a storm.

15:45.666 --> 15:47.601
Let's keep moving.

15:54.508 --> 15:56.376
Allow me.

16:10.458 --> 16:11.758
Hey, hoppy...

16:11.759 --> 16:13.893
Yeah, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

16:15.663 --> 16:17.797
Why don't you just let me
take a look at your leg?

16:17.798 --> 16:18.665
Nah, it's cool.

16:18.666 --> 16:21.334
You're bleeding again.

16:21.335 --> 16:22.736
Just forget it, okay?

16:22.737 --> 16:25.705
Hank, stop being
a child.

16:25.706 --> 16:26.940
Ah! I said I'm fine!

16:26.941 --> 16:29.376
You're not fine.

16:30.645 --> 16:32.012
Oh.

16:32.013 --> 16:33.413
Ooh...

16:33.414 --> 16:34.414
I think you almost
nicked an artery.

16:34.415 --> 16:37.550
Almost.

16:37.551 --> 16:38.785
Oh, God.

16:40.621 --> 16:41.921
Okay, look,

16:41.922 --> 16:44.557
without our comtechs,
we're running blind here, okay?

16:44.558 --> 16:45.592
We have no idea

16:45.593 --> 16:46.559
what happened
to Will and Magnus,

16:46.560 --> 16:47.727
we just keep
moving down,

16:47.728 --> 16:48.862
we have no food or water.

16:48.863 --> 16:50.263
Center of the earth here!

16:50.264 --> 16:51.698
Exactly.

16:51.699 --> 16:53.333
All we have is each other,

16:53.334 --> 16:54.901
which is why
I need you in one piece.

16:56.737 --> 16:58.471
Okay?

16:59.674 --> 17:00.940
Yeah.

17:00.941 --> 17:02.042
I wonder
if Henry and Kate

17:02.043 --> 17:04.344
have made it
this far.

17:06.380 --> 17:08.815
How far down
do you think we are?

17:08.816 --> 17:12.719
A few kilometers,
at least.

17:15.455 --> 17:17.924
This is not
incandescent.

17:17.925 --> 17:21.394
Wonder what
the power source is?

17:31.005 --> 17:32.405
At least we know

17:32.406 --> 17:35.508
there are humans
down here.

17:52.793 --> 17:54.861
Our ticket
to the city?

17:54.862 --> 17:56.730
I'd like to avoid
the armed escort

17:56.731 --> 17:58.064
as long as possible.

17:58.065 --> 17:59.799
Yeah.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.721
That...

18:21.722 --> 18:23.523
Is awesome.

18:23.524 --> 18:27.660
It's just like
the one in the model.

18:27.661 --> 18:30.530
We can't be too far
from the city now.

18:48.416 --> 18:52.452
What is that?

18:52.453 --> 18:54.888
It appears to be a moss
or lichen of some sort.

18:56.090 --> 18:58.057
It's more like
stinkweed.

18:58.058 --> 19:01.661
No, that distinctive aroma
isn't coming from the plant.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.963
It smells like...

19:03.964 --> 19:05.832
Feces.

19:11.539 --> 19:12.705
Fascinating.

19:12.706 --> 19:14.174
Yeah,

19:14.175 --> 19:15.575
that's not the adjective
I would have used

19:15.576 --> 19:17.076
to describe that.

19:17.077 --> 19:19.078
High concentration of ammonia,

19:19.079 --> 19:22.115
similar to the excrement
of the abnormal fenhorse

19:22.116 --> 19:23.616
we have on the surface.

19:23.617 --> 19:27.587
It would explain
its phosphorescent pigment.

19:27.588 --> 19:29.422
How large
an animal

19:29.423 --> 19:30.590
do you think
it would take to--

19:30.591 --> 19:31.758
oh, quite large.

19:38.833 --> 19:40.867
Aw...

19:47.168 --> 19:48.535
Will!

19:52.774 --> 19:54.441
Will, don't look
at the Basilisk,

19:54.442 --> 19:55.409
or you'll die!

19:55.410 --> 19:57.378
Oh, come on!

19:57.379 --> 19:58.712
That's just a legend, right?

19:58.713 --> 20:00.347
No, it isn't!

20:00.348 --> 20:02.916
These creatures disappeared
from the surface eons ago.

20:02.917 --> 20:04.385
Now we know where they went.

20:09.591 --> 20:10.891
Whoa!

20:10.892 --> 20:12.860
I said don't look at it!

20:12.861 --> 20:13.861
I know, but that's like saying

20:13.862 --> 20:16.263
"don't think of
a yellow rhinoceros!"

20:16.264 --> 20:17.731
Besides, just because
I can't see it,

20:17.732 --> 20:19.466
doesn't mean
it can't see me.

20:19.467 --> 20:20.834
Well, yes, it does.

20:20.835 --> 20:24.138
The creature's eyes are
a cluster of photoreceptors.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.473
When it scans for prey,
it searches for faces,

20:26.474 --> 20:27.508
especially eyes.

20:27.509 --> 20:29.410
So you mean that
this giant dragon snake

20:29.411 --> 20:31.445
is all about
facial recognition?

20:31.446 --> 20:32.579
Essentially, yes.

20:32.580 --> 20:34.548
That's kind of cool.

20:37.285 --> 20:38.752
How about just one eye?

20:39.688 --> 20:42.122
It's not a toy!

20:42.123 --> 20:43.657
I know!

20:43.658 --> 20:44.858
It's still kind of cool, though.

20:44.859 --> 20:46.160
Use your phone.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.462
The blank screen
acts like a mirror.

20:48.463 --> 20:50.798
Why would I bring my phone
to hollow earth?

20:55.737 --> 20:57.137
It's also deaf.

20:57.138 --> 20:58.472
And it seems

20:58.473 --> 20:59.306
that the stench
of its own feces.

20:59.307 --> 21:00.407
Is masking our scent.

21:10.485 --> 21:11.819
Duck!

21:13.388 --> 21:14.221
It senses we're here.

21:14.222 --> 21:15.289
We need to split up.

21:15.290 --> 21:16.523
Okay.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.764
Will, it's right behind you.

21:23.765 --> 21:26.767
How am I supposed to outrun
something that I can't see?

21:26.768 --> 21:27.835
Will, it's right
on top of you!

21:27.836 --> 21:28.936
Whatever you do, don't--

21:28.937 --> 21:30.571
I know, I know!

21:32.774 --> 21:34.641
Nice Kitty...

21:35.710 --> 21:37.277
It just all looks
the same down here.

21:37.278 --> 21:39.446
It's just more rock.

21:39.447 --> 21:41.815
How you doing?

21:41.816 --> 21:43.784
Crappy,
thanks for asking.

21:43.785 --> 21:44.818
Well, we've got
to keep going

21:44.819 --> 21:46.420
and try to find
this city,

21:46.421 --> 21:48.889
because that is where
Magnus and Will will be.

21:48.890 --> 21:49.757
Yeah.

21:49.758 --> 21:50.824
If they made it.

21:50.825 --> 21:51.658
I'll be fine.

21:51.659 --> 21:52.593
Let's just keep--

21:52.594 --> 21:53.794
oh, no!

21:53.795 --> 21:56.530
What?

21:56.531 --> 21:58.699
It's the tracking dot I left

21:58.700 --> 22:00.667
the last time we came by
this exact same spot.

22:00.668 --> 22:02.402
We're just goin' around
in circles.

22:02.403 --> 22:05.239
Hey, just be quiet
for a sec.

22:18.686 --> 22:19.720
Huh.

22:19.721 --> 22:20.754
Looks like a rain gutter.

22:20.755 --> 22:22.489
It doesn't rain underground.

22:22.490 --> 22:24.124
Then a spring.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.492
I mean, they've gotta get
p9 their water from somewhere,

22:25.493 --> 22:26.760
right?

22:26.761 --> 22:27.694
We didn't see this
last time around,

22:27.695 --> 22:29.830
so someone must have
turned on a tap.

22:29.831 --> 22:32.766
More importantly,
this has to lead somewhere.

22:34.269 --> 22:37.738
You know, I'm really
not having a good day here!

22:37.739 --> 22:38.939
Keep your face hidden.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.741
I'll draw it out.

22:46.981 --> 22:50.851
Will!

22:53.388 --> 22:56.957
I'm getting tired
of this game.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.559
I think it's
had enough too.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.961
It seems to be narrowing
the field of play.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.798
Magnus...

23:06.601 --> 23:08.335
Aw, you know
what smells worse

23:08.336 --> 23:09.603
than Basilisk dung?

23:09.604 --> 23:12.673
Barbecued version.

23:12.674 --> 23:14.408
Will!

23:15.810 --> 23:16.910
Hey!

23:16.911 --> 23:19.479
Hey, look out!

23:21.616 --> 23:22.850
What the-- ?

23:22.851 --> 23:23.917
What?

23:23.918 --> 23:26.386
It's a hologram.

23:26.387 --> 23:27.654
Where's it
coming from?

23:27.655 --> 23:28.856
From here.

23:33.795 --> 23:35.028
You'll be safe now.

23:35.029 --> 23:36.196
This way.

23:36.197 --> 23:38.031
You speak
our language?

23:38.032 --> 23:39.066
Apparently...

23:39.067 --> 23:42.636
You speak our language.

23:42.637 --> 23:45.372
Why do your clothes
look so strange?

23:45.373 --> 23:46.907
What were you doing out there
without a mask?

23:46.908 --> 23:48.442
Linor, enough.

23:48.443 --> 23:49.509
We've got to hurry.

23:49.510 --> 23:50.477
Close your light.

23:57.919 --> 24:00.053
Oh, so now you admit

24:00.054 --> 24:01.688
that you should have
listened to me.

24:01.689 --> 24:03.023
Okay, come on.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.024
You still haven't
given us an answer.

24:04.025 --> 24:06.827
Oh, well, then,
let's review, shall we?

24:06.828 --> 24:08.662
Earthquake at the gateway,

24:08.663 --> 24:10.764
dead tracking beacon,

24:10.765 --> 24:13.033
and now you've come
to ask me for my help.

24:14.502 --> 24:16.036
You know,
there's only so much bile

24:16.037 --> 24:19.439
I can swallow
in a single day.

24:19.440 --> 24:22.009
Hey, we're not making
any deals with Hyde.

24:22.010 --> 24:24.444
We want Adam.

24:31.452 --> 24:34.688
All right then, I'm in.

24:53.841 --> 24:55.842
This is your farm?

24:55.843 --> 24:57.844
We share it.

24:57.845 --> 24:58.912
We travel,

24:58.913 --> 25:00.781
work the harvest,
move on to the next one.

25:00.782 --> 25:03.050
Nomadic culture.

25:03.051 --> 25:04.718
So this is a seasonal camp.

25:05.954 --> 25:07.421
Out here on the fringes,

25:07.422 --> 25:09.589
you can't count on anything
but yourself

25:09.590 --> 25:10.824
and the folks around you,

25:10.825 --> 25:13.493
but we get by.

25:13.494 --> 25:14.728
It's harder

25:14.729 --> 25:15.829
when the propulsion units fail,

25:15.830 --> 25:17.097
or we lose power for a cycle.

25:17.098 --> 25:18.532
It's...

25:18.533 --> 25:20.767
It's not so easy
to make our quotas then.

25:20.768 --> 25:22.469
Does that happen often?

25:22.470 --> 25:26.039
More than
it used to.

25:27.675 --> 25:30.010
Stay close.

25:30.011 --> 25:32.012
My family.

25:32.013 --> 25:33.246
It's all right,

25:33.247 --> 25:35.148
they were trapped
by the firebreather.

25:35.149 --> 25:37.584
You're not from the city.

25:37.585 --> 25:38.452
Uh, no,
no, we're not.

25:39.854 --> 25:41.989
They're from
the surface.

25:43.925 --> 25:46.560
How did you..?

25:46.561 --> 25:48.628
It's a long story.

25:52.533 --> 25:53.834
Come sit.

25:56.237 --> 25:57.704
That's very kind of you.

25:57.705 --> 25:58.572
Thank you.

26:04.679 --> 26:05.946
Hey, uh, how did you
do that thing with...

26:05.947 --> 26:07.914
With your hand?

26:07.915 --> 26:09.783
Oh, you mean this?

26:09.784 --> 26:12.786
Yeah.

26:12.787 --> 26:14.988
Only young ones
can do it.

26:14.989 --> 26:16.523
We, um,

26:16.524 --> 26:18.592
we lose the ability
as we get older.

26:18.593 --> 26:20.827
And that's how
you defend yourselves?

26:20.828 --> 26:22.696
It's an amazing
survival mechanism.

26:23.798 --> 26:25.732
You look tired.

26:25.733 --> 26:27.000
Eat plenty.

26:27.001 --> 26:29.036
It will restore you.

26:29.037 --> 26:30.971
Thank you.

26:30.972 --> 26:32.806
Nothing like
a firebreather fight

26:32.807 --> 26:34.975
to whip up
an appetite.

26:52.693 --> 26:55.562
Mmm.

27:02.036 --> 27:05.772
There was a breach
at one of the old gateways.

27:05.773 --> 27:07.107
That's impossible.

27:07.108 --> 27:08.241
Well, it wasn't a system fault.

27:08.242 --> 27:09.910
Clear sensor
readings.

27:09.911 --> 27:11.178
I'm listening.

27:11.179 --> 27:14.815
Three surface life-forms
were detected,

27:14.816 --> 27:16.817
and one more that was cloaked.

27:16.818 --> 27:19.252
Bring the incomers
to me.

27:19.253 --> 27:21.755
I can't.

27:21.756 --> 27:24.291
They escaped.

27:25.693 --> 27:27.861
Dispatch the Garrison at once.

27:27.862 --> 27:30.664
Right.

27:34.235 --> 27:38.138
We've heard some stories
about the surface.

27:38.139 --> 27:42.976
A place where armies battle
for inches of land.

27:42.977 --> 27:45.645
Places without medicine,
blighted with plagues.

27:45.646 --> 27:46.947
I think your stories

27:46.948 --> 27:49.616
might be somewhat
out of date.

27:49.617 --> 27:51.751
We have war
and disease, it's true,

27:51.752 --> 27:54.121
but we also have
great beauty,

27:54.122 --> 27:56.089
great accomplishments,
great cities.

27:57.725 --> 27:58.725
Then why are you here?

27:58.726 --> 28:01.294
You also have a great city,

28:01.295 --> 28:02.262
and we need to get there.

28:02.263 --> 28:04.698
Praxis?

28:04.699 --> 28:06.600
Do you have a clearance?

28:06.601 --> 28:08.735
Clearance?

28:08.736 --> 28:11.838
No one enters Praxis
without a clearance.

28:11.839 --> 28:14.141
Even when we go to trade
the Rashi, we need one.

28:14.142 --> 28:16.076
We don't have a clearance,

28:16.077 --> 28:18.044
but I believe
that my father's there,

28:18.045 --> 28:19.279
and I need to find him.

28:19.280 --> 28:22.149
Well...

28:22.150 --> 28:24.951
We-we can get you
to the outland gate,

28:24.952 --> 28:27.554
but we can't enter.

28:27.555 --> 28:28.622
Oh, that would be great.

28:28.623 --> 28:30.290
Just get us close,

28:30.291 --> 28:31.291
and we'll do the rest.

28:32.793 --> 28:33.727
I'll get water
for the journey.

28:33.728 --> 28:34.561
Let us help you.

28:34.562 --> 28:36.630
No! Please...

28:36.631 --> 28:38.732
Enjoy the harvest.

28:38.733 --> 28:40.033
The Rashi is good for you.

28:40.034 --> 28:42.035
You're looking stronger already.

28:46.941 --> 28:50.110
I believe I can adjust
the penetration depth...

28:50.111 --> 28:54.114
So the needles access
my occipital lobe,

28:54.115 --> 28:55.882
specifically
the visual cortex.

28:55.883 --> 28:57.184
Right,

28:57.185 --> 28:57.951
where all spatial
relationships

28:57.952 --> 28:59.119
are processed.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.120
Which I gather
is necessary

29:00.121 --> 29:01.388
for you to teleport.

29:01.389 --> 29:02.189
Yeah, if I don't know
where I'm going,

29:02.190 --> 29:03.223
things can get rather messy.

29:03.224 --> 29:04.591
Understood.

29:04.592 --> 29:05.659
Now, a problem
is that

29:05.660 --> 29:07.294
any data we retrieve
from your brain

29:07.295 --> 29:08.995
will be
in binary form,

29:08.996 --> 29:11.264
just a sequence
of zeroes and ones.

29:11.265 --> 29:12.599
True,

29:12.600 --> 29:14.134
but if we combine
the coordinates

29:14.135 --> 29:15.735
from Adam's brain

29:15.736 --> 29:18.004
with the holographic
map...

29:18.005 --> 29:20.073
We just might make it
through in one piece.

29:26.981 --> 29:28.081
Looks like our
little rain gutter

29:28.082 --> 29:30.050
veers off to the left.

29:30.051 --> 29:31.885
Yeah, now we're
getting somewhere.

29:31.886 --> 29:33.787
I haven't seen one of my little
tracking dots in a while.

29:33.788 --> 29:34.754
Yeah, but
that doesn't mean

29:34.755 --> 29:36.623
we know where
we're going.

29:36.624 --> 29:38.858
At least it ain't
where we've been.

29:40.928 --> 29:43.296
Oh, hey,
check this out.

29:43.297 --> 29:44.431
Huh...

29:46.734 --> 29:48.201
Looks like a water
collection tank.

29:48.202 --> 29:49.803
It's made out of the same stone
as the rest of the cave.

29:49.804 --> 29:50.837
It's like it grew here.

29:50.838 --> 29:51.905
So we were right.

29:51.906 --> 29:53.139
This is someone's plumbing.

29:53.140 --> 29:55.242
And where there's plumbing,
there's...

29:55.243 --> 29:56.376
Toilets.

29:57.645 --> 29:58.845
Civilization.

29:58.846 --> 30:00.080
We're going to find
people down here--

30:00.081 --> 30:00.880
Hank.

30:03.751 --> 30:05.352
Greetings.

30:05.353 --> 30:06.386
Hey!

30:09.156 --> 30:10.023
Oh!

30:26.480 --> 30:28.561
All right, system's up
and ready to receive.

30:29.468 --> 30:30.534
All set?

30:30.535 --> 30:32.570
Let's do it.

30:42.114 --> 30:44.015
There you are.

30:44.016 --> 30:45.650
The brain in binary.

30:45.651 --> 30:48.653
Oh, Nikola...

30:48.654 --> 30:49.820
Always was a fan.

30:50.989 --> 30:51.822
Yeah, I know.

30:54.526 --> 30:56.694
Hey, you know,
it's not a race.

30:56.695 --> 30:58.796
What's with
all this energy anyway?

30:58.797 --> 31:00.364
I think Narra
must have been right

31:00.365 --> 31:02.066
about the medicinal
properties of the fungus.

31:02.067 --> 31:03.434
Without sunlight,

31:03.435 --> 31:04.735
their food must
contain massive doses

31:04.736 --> 31:07.571
of Vitamin D.

31:11.610 --> 31:14.178
Check for
security devices.

31:20.919 --> 31:22.787
Nothing here
like we saw at the gateway.

31:22.788 --> 31:24.121
No electric eyes,

31:24.122 --> 31:26.891
no vampire detector.

31:26.892 --> 31:29.126
Maybe nobody
makes it this far.

31:41.239 --> 31:42.640
Now, that looks like...

31:42.641 --> 31:44.875
Mass transit.

32:06.832 --> 32:08.666
Well, this
is different.

32:08.667 --> 32:10.701
Very much so.

32:10.702 --> 32:11.869
You think this
ping pong ball

32:11.870 --> 32:14.505
will take us
to the city?

32:14.506 --> 32:17.141
There's only one way
to find out.

32:38.630 --> 32:39.997
We're traveling vertically
and horizontally

32:39.998 --> 32:42.133
at an incredible rate.

32:42.134 --> 32:45.069
It's like being inside
a gyroscope.

32:45.070 --> 32:47.071
The inner sphere is held
at constant orientation

32:47.072 --> 32:48.873
by some kind of repulser jets,

32:48.874 --> 32:51.709
pneumatic maybe,
or dipolar.

32:51.710 --> 32:52.777
You know,
when you put it like that,

32:52.778 --> 32:54.211
it sounds so simple.

32:54.212 --> 32:55.746
We're talking about something

32:55.747 --> 32:57.982
built by
an advanced civilization.

32:57.983 --> 32:59.884
This could well predate
our decision

32:59.885 --> 33:01.018
to bang two rocks together

33:01.019 --> 33:02.586
and call it
toolmaking.

33:02.587 --> 33:03.821
Has it ever occurred to you

33:03.822 --> 33:05.656
that a civilization
this advanced

33:05.657 --> 33:07.858
might have a way of monitoring
their transportation system?

33:07.859 --> 33:09.727
You mean they already know
we're coming?

33:09.728 --> 33:11.061
Well, we don't have
any entry clearances,

33:11.062 --> 33:13.631
we have no idea
where Henry and Kate are,

33:13.632 --> 33:15.666
or if they've even
made it this far...

33:15.667 --> 33:17.201
I'm just saying, it feels like
we're heading into a trap.

33:17.202 --> 33:19.370
All true,

33:19.371 --> 33:20.571
but can you think of
a faster way

33:20.572 --> 33:21.639
to get into the city?

33:23.775 --> 33:25.176
This should
translate the data

33:25.177 --> 33:26.677
from your
visual cortex

33:26.678 --> 33:29.847
into a language this
thing can understand.

33:29.848 --> 33:31.882
Allow me, huh?

33:43.195 --> 33:44.328
Amazing.

33:44.329 --> 33:46.197
Well done, us.

33:46.198 --> 33:48.599
I always knew
we'd work well together.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.167
You just never
gave me the chance.

33:50.168 --> 33:51.836
Yeah, well, better
late than never, huh?

33:51.837 --> 33:52.937
Now, the rock
surrounding the city

33:52.938 --> 33:55.840
has a high percentage
of lodestone.

33:55.841 --> 33:56.974
So it's highly
magnetic.

33:56.975 --> 33:59.176
Which helps with their
communication signals,

33:59.177 --> 34:02.213
but also acts as a natural
electro-magnetic shield.

34:02.214 --> 34:03.614
I wouldn't suggest
teleporting in there,

34:03.615 --> 34:05.015
by the way.

34:05.016 --> 34:06.917
Your particles would ricochet
like a bullet.

34:06.918 --> 34:08.118
Yes.

34:08.119 --> 34:09.620
Why didn't you
mention this before?

34:09.621 --> 34:11.388
Because of these.

34:13.391 --> 34:16.659
Supply tunnels a few miles
above the city.

34:16.661 --> 34:19.263
Primarily granite
in composition.

34:19.264 --> 34:20.831
That's our safe
entry point.

34:20.831 --> 34:21.764
From there,

34:21.766 --> 34:22.632
we can make it
to the city on foot.

34:24.034 --> 34:25.969
Well?

34:25.971 --> 34:29.206
I'd prefer
a larger space,

34:29.206 --> 34:32.643
just to allow for
that margin of error.

34:32.643 --> 34:34.143
I know just the place.

34:38.783 --> 34:40.985
That'll do
just fine.

34:40.985 --> 34:43.254
Thought so.

34:52.429 --> 34:53.964
Ugh...

34:53.965 --> 34:55.666
What the hell
did they shoot us with,

34:55.667 --> 34:56.867
a hangover gun?

34:56.868 --> 34:58.769
Some sort of energy blast.

34:58.770 --> 35:00.170
Knocked out
our electrical system.

35:00.171 --> 35:01.672
Are you saying we got rebooted?

35:01.673 --> 35:02.973
Uh-huh.

35:02.974 --> 35:04.241
I am definitely having
a vista moment.

35:04.242 --> 35:05.776
All right, where
do you think we are,

35:05.777 --> 35:07.811
the city?

35:07.812 --> 35:10.314
Well,
it ain't Kansas.

35:20.258 --> 35:21.425
I think we're slowing down.

35:27.432 --> 35:32.202
And I believe
this is our stop.

35:53.648 --> 35:54.926
Okay, now
it's your turn.

35:55.732 --> 35:57.132
Bloody hell.

36:07.926 --> 36:09.027
You know,
I know we all did

36:09.045 --> 36:11.012
some fancy footwork
with the slide rule,

36:11.013 --> 36:12.114
but there's still
no guarantee

36:12.115 --> 36:13.148
this will work.

36:13.149 --> 36:14.216
True. Then,
there rarely is.

36:14.217 --> 36:15.851
Fair enough.

36:15.852 --> 36:17.252
Now, if things
go pear-shaped,

36:17.253 --> 36:18.620
make sure you get some help
before coming after us.

36:18.621 --> 36:19.921
I'm coming with you.

36:19.922 --> 36:21.923
Well, someone
has to stay behind

36:21.924 --> 36:23.091
and man the fort.

36:23.092 --> 36:24.059
Yeah, well,
since when did I become

36:24.060 --> 36:25.527
the responsible member
of this group?

36:25.528 --> 36:26.795
The big hairy one
can answer the phone.

36:26.796 --> 36:28.196
I'm not missing out on this.

36:28.197 --> 36:30.665
You're absolutely determined
to come with us?

36:30.666 --> 36:31.733
Well, of course I am.

36:33.236 --> 36:35.070
If you insist.

36:37.006 --> 36:39.875
Son of a bitch!

36:40.943 --> 36:43.645
Nice one!

36:47.283 --> 36:48.850
Incredible!

36:48.851 --> 36:51.486
Ah, you haven't
seen nothing yet.

36:51.487 --> 36:53.121
This way.

37:12.975 --> 37:14.743
At least someone's
enjoying the show.

37:14.744 --> 37:16.811
No door handle,

37:16.812 --> 37:19.881
no visible locking mechanism...

37:19.882 --> 37:20.982
It's probably
electric.

37:23.252 --> 37:25.754
Definitely electric.

37:25.755 --> 37:28.590
Ow.

37:33.029 --> 37:34.129
Hey.

37:36.232 --> 37:37.065
Kate, Henry!

37:37.066 --> 37:38.600
Thank God
you're all right.

37:38.601 --> 37:41.736
So I take it you guys
aren't here to rescue us.

37:41.737 --> 37:44.005
What happened to your leg?

37:44.006 --> 37:45.941
Well, that's
a Dr. Freelander special.

37:45.942 --> 37:47.042
It only hurts
when I walk,

37:47.043 --> 37:48.376
or stand.

37:48.377 --> 37:49.177
Let me take
a look at it.

37:50.713 --> 37:52.180
So how did you two
end up here?

37:52.181 --> 37:53.782
Uh, we were attacked

37:53.783 --> 37:55.317
by telepathic Hare Krishnas
with ring guns.

37:55.318 --> 37:57.018
You?

37:57.019 --> 37:58.687
Fed by a holo-projecting
mushroom farmer,

37:58.688 --> 37:59.955
took the bus, didn't pay,
got arrested.

37:59.956 --> 38:02.657
Let's call it a tie.

38:02.658 --> 38:04.025
Judging by our surroundings,

38:04.026 --> 38:06.228
I think the city doesn't welcome
surface-dwellers either.

38:07.630 --> 38:08.730
Good job.

38:08.731 --> 38:09.931
The patient
will live.

38:11.634 --> 38:13.635
Brownout.

38:13.636 --> 38:15.203
Huh, it's happening here, too.

38:15.204 --> 38:16.905
We noticed several
power fluctuations

38:16.906 --> 38:18.240
along the way,

38:18.241 --> 38:21.109
usually precipitated by
mild earth tremors.

38:22.311 --> 38:23.678
So, Kate,

38:23.679 --> 38:25.113
any thoughts
on getting out of here?

38:25.114 --> 38:26.615
Not happening.

38:26.616 --> 38:28.250
This place is
tight as a drum.

38:28.251 --> 38:29.584
Hmm,

38:29.585 --> 38:31.987
so I guess it's up to our hosts
to make the next move.

38:37.126 --> 38:38.093
I thought you said

38:38.094 --> 38:39.361
these tunnels
were granite.

38:39.362 --> 38:40.762
Earlier,
where we entered.

38:40.763 --> 38:42.030
Now we're moving
deeper underground.

38:42.031 --> 38:42.864
Well, this is
magnetite.

38:42.865 --> 38:43.865
Lodestone.

38:43.866 --> 38:44.799
As I told you,

38:44.800 --> 38:46.167
the closer
we get to the city...

38:46.168 --> 38:47.002
How much farther?

38:47.003 --> 38:48.403
Just up ahead

38:48.404 --> 38:49.704
there's a cavern
with a branch tunnel.

38:49.705 --> 38:51.873
It leads directly
to the outlands.

38:51.874 --> 38:53.675
From there we can access
one of the city gates.

38:53.676 --> 38:56.978
That is, if Helen managed
to make it that far.

38:56.979 --> 39:00.682
For your sake, pray she did.

39:12.395 --> 39:13.295
Adam!

39:13.296 --> 39:15.030
Has fulfilled his function

39:15.031 --> 39:17.365
thus far.

39:24.740 --> 39:28.710
Now it's time
for the adult to take over.

39:29.779 --> 39:31.413
Now you're
my prisoner, Johnny.

39:31.414 --> 39:34.249
Welcome to my world.

39:39.989 --> 39:41.990
Time to go.

39:45.895 --> 39:47.295
This is not
going to be good.

39:47.296 --> 39:48.296
Ah, you think?

40:36.212 --> 40:38.113
I am Ranna Seneschal,
leader of Praxis.

40:38.114 --> 40:39.314
I'm--

40:39.315 --> 40:40.415
Helen Magnus.

40:41.717 --> 40:43.752
You know me?

40:43.753 --> 40:45.286
Well, then, you must know
where my father is.

40:45.287 --> 40:46.421
This is not a council.

40:46.422 --> 40:47.856
This is a judgement.

40:49.091 --> 40:50.959
You are incomers
from above.

40:50.960 --> 40:53.528
A threat to this city
and to this realm.

40:53.529 --> 40:56.798
You're to be executed.

40:56.799 --> 40:57.999
Immediately.

41:09.745 --> 41:12.781
A summary execution?

41:12.782 --> 41:13.948
And here I was thinking

41:13.949 --> 41:15.116
you might be
more evolved than us.

41:15.117 --> 41:16.451
Yeah, back home,

41:16.452 --> 41:18.086
we have this thing,
it's called a trial?

41:18.087 --> 41:22.257
It's kind of a sign
of a civilized society.

41:22.258 --> 41:24.159
Legal proceedings are reserved
for citizens of Praxis alone,

41:24.160 --> 41:26.027
not outlanders,

41:26.028 --> 41:27.962
and certainly not those

41:27.963 --> 41:29.898
who engage in treason
against our people.

41:29.899 --> 41:32.967
You appeared
in our avatar chamber.

41:32.968 --> 41:34.669
We came here
looking for my father!

41:34.670 --> 41:35.537
Where is he?

41:35.538 --> 41:36.971
The law is clear.

41:36.972 --> 41:39.774
Those who trespass our realm,

41:39.775 --> 41:42.043
who undermine our way of life,

41:42.044 --> 41:43.311
will be executed.

41:43.312 --> 41:44.979
Oh, come on.

41:44.980 --> 41:46.548
Look, her old man
sent a message,

41:46.549 --> 41:49.484
and we came here
to say hello.

41:49.485 --> 41:51.219
This is essentially
a cultural exchange mission.

41:51.220 --> 41:53.154
This woman is dying

41:53.155 --> 41:55.390
from radiation
poisoning!

41:55.391 --> 41:56.891
You can't just kill us

41:56.892 --> 41:59.260
without letting us explain
why we're here.

41:59.261 --> 42:00.395
Yes, we can.

42:02.465 --> 42:05.900
Big Brother, third reich,
fascist pigs!

42:05.901 --> 42:07.302
Henry...

42:07.303 --> 42:09.170
Sorry, sentenced
to death here.

42:09.171 --> 42:10.171
Magnus,

42:10.172 --> 42:11.539
I can't hap.

42:11.540 --> 42:13.141
Your DNA is locked, Mr. Foss.

42:13.142 --> 42:15.243
We don't abide
unlawful transmutations here.

42:15.244 --> 42:17.045
What?

42:17.046 --> 42:20.014
Really?
You can do that?

42:20.015 --> 42:22.050
You're making a huge mistake.

42:22.051 --> 42:24.018
We came here in peace.

42:24.019 --> 42:27.455
And in doing so,
you condemned yourselves.

42:27.456 --> 42:28.456
Proceed.

42:28.457 --> 42:29.557
Don't do this.

42:52.448 --> 42:55.450
Justice is served.
