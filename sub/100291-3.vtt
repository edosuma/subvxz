WEBVTT

00:08.156 --> 00:10.117
I killed Michael and Susan Connors.

00:10.157 --> 00:12.100
Both of them.
They deserved to die!

00:12.140 --> 00:14.380
Before you go down for 30 years
for this girl,

00:14.420 --> 00:17.260
you need to know that
Annabel is not defending you!

00:17.300 --> 00:18.779
We're releasing her on police bail.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.739
Annabel had a strong influence
over Charlotte.

00:21.780 --> 00:22.939
How much did they steal?

00:22.980 --> 00:24.540
Just under £10,000.

00:24.579 --> 00:25.700
Thought about what I asked?

00:25.739 --> 00:28.820
I'll talk to the Chief Constable
tomorrow.

00:28.860 --> 00:31.139
Bancroft did for Mrs Kamara,
I know it.

00:31.180 --> 00:32.299
I just can't prove it.

00:35.180 --> 00:36.259
Well?

00:36.299 --> 00:38.180
It's done.

00:39.259 --> 00:40.820
They found the murder weapon,

00:40.860 --> 00:42.619
a croquet mallet
from the Connors' garden.

00:42.660 --> 00:44.659
It's got Joe's fingerprints
all over it.

01:08.939 --> 01:11.579
Martin...

01:11.619 --> 01:13.379
Don't bother.

01:16.580 --> 01:19.020
You stop this, all right?
Just stop it.

01:19.059 --> 01:20.859
It's a free country.
I can park where I like.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.499
You've been here every day.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.699
Leave my sister alone.

01:24.740 --> 01:28.460
I'm here to check you're sticking to
your bail agreement, Annabel.

01:28.499 --> 01:30.139
I feel sorry for you.

01:30.180 --> 01:32.380
The trauma you've suffered.

01:32.419 --> 01:35.339
Fired after what,
25 years of service?

01:35.380 --> 01:37.100
I'm on sick leave.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.660
And on top of that,
having to accept Joe's a murderer.

01:39.699 --> 01:41.619
I don't accept it.

01:41.660 --> 01:42.820
You're his mother.

01:42.859 --> 01:44.499
It must be hard to see it.

01:44.540 --> 01:46.699
I've never seen more clearly
in my life.

01:51.499 --> 01:53.460
I see you, Annabel.

01:56.820 --> 01:58.419
Let's go.

01:59.419 --> 02:00.419
Come on.

02:52.659 --> 02:54.860
OK, listen up, everybody.

02:57.740 --> 03:01.939
As you know, a Missing Persons Team
has been on the case

03:01.980 --> 03:03.339
for the last four days.

03:03.379 --> 03:06.900
They've established that
DS Andy Bevan was last seen here,

03:06.939 --> 03:10.539
in this station,
at 15:32 on Thursday.

03:11.580 --> 03:14.059
After that, nothing.

03:14.099 --> 03:17.379
When a colleague disappears,
we all need to pull together.

03:18.659 --> 03:21.180
If anyone has any information,

03:21.219 --> 03:23.219
relay it to the team.

03:23.260 --> 03:27.939
Or if you feel
there's something confidential,

03:27.980 --> 03:29.779
my door's always open.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.099
Thank you.

03:40.819 --> 03:44.700
All you've gotta do is a satellite
trace on his burner phone.

03:44.740 --> 03:47.260
"All"? Dad!

03:47.300 --> 03:49.260
I couldn't do that from home.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.260
I'd have to do it from work,
illegally.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.260
It could tell us
what his last movements were.

03:54.539 --> 03:57.099
He disappeared on 31st January
in the afternoon.

03:57.140 --> 03:58.379
No.

03:58.420 --> 04:00.339
I've done this for you once.

04:00.379 --> 04:02.499
I'm not doing it again.

04:07.860 --> 04:09.539
No, you're right.

04:09.580 --> 04:11.580
It's too much to ask.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.099
Don't worry about it.

04:15.740 --> 04:18.219
I'll have to find
someone else to help me.

04:20.300 --> 04:24.980
Mind you, these people, they can be
quite unscrupulous, can't they?

04:25.020 --> 04:26.659
Could shop me.

04:51.460 --> 04:54.460
All this, how does it help?

04:55.500 --> 04:58.859
If we're going with the assumption
that Annabel did it...

04:58.900 --> 05:00.900
The night of the murder,
there's too much going on.

05:02.140 --> 05:04.500
She goes up there,
she kills Michael and Susan,

05:04.539 --> 05:08.380
disposes of evidence,
dumps the vehicle, sets Joe up...

05:08.419 --> 05:09.979
And?

05:10.020 --> 05:12.020
Annabel has a history
of using patsies.

05:13.380 --> 05:16.779
When she did the fraud at school,
she did it with another girl.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.380
It's the same pattern here.

05:22.419 --> 05:24.419
She didn't murder her parents
on her own.

05:31.140 --> 05:34.500
Dear Lord, thank you
for all my loved ones,

05:34.539 --> 05:36.099
seated around this table.

05:36.140 --> 05:39.659
Thank you for the food
you've provided for us this day.

05:39.700 --> 05:42.380
And thank you for
the Christmas season,

05:42.419 --> 05:46.620
when we can find joy
in the birth of Jesus Christ.

05:51.700 --> 05:52.820
Amen.

05:52.859 --> 05:54.179
Amen.

05:54.219 --> 05:56.219
Dig in, everyone.

06:08.020 --> 06:10.260
What's in the stuffing?

06:29.580 --> 06:30.859
You ever played, Joe?

06:30.900 --> 06:33.020
No.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.260
Bloody terrible game.

06:35.299 --> 06:37.219
Annabel's good at it.

06:37.260 --> 06:38.779
Yeah. She's good at everything.

06:41.179 --> 06:43.179
You're head over heels, aren't you?

06:44.219 --> 06:46.219
I've never met anyone like her.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.339
You might think you love her,

06:49.380 --> 06:51.940
but she's not the right person
for you.

06:55.500 --> 06:56.700
Joe!

07:00.940 --> 07:02.380
I don't know how to.

07:02.419 --> 07:04.859
Come on. I'll teach you.

07:04.900 --> 07:07.179
Croquet on Christmas Day
is a family tradition.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.900
Everything I thought about her
was wrong,

07:20.940 --> 07:22.940
every single thing
that she told me was a lie.

07:24.460 --> 07:27.500
I even confessed for her.
How could I have been so stupid?

07:27.539 --> 07:29.940
Well, if you're like that,
it's easy to trick people.

07:29.979 --> 07:32.140
Now we've got to go through
every bit of evidence,

07:32.179 --> 07:34.140
to try and find out
how she set you up.

07:34.179 --> 07:36.500
I think she drugged me,
the night of the murder.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.859
What?

07:37.900 --> 07:39.900
Yeah, I was so out of it,
the next day.

07:39.940 --> 07:42.140
I was coming down from something,
but it wasn't weed.

07:42.179 --> 07:44.339
That would have allowed her
to plant the trainers.

07:44.380 --> 07:45.515
What about the murder weapon?

07:45.539 --> 07:47.299
The mallet had my fingerprints on it

07:47.339 --> 07:49.219
because she gave it to me
at Christmas.

07:50.739 --> 07:52.460
Maybe.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.659
She's been planning this
for quite some time.

07:56.219 --> 07:58.419
Can you think of anyone
that could have helped her,

07:58.460 --> 08:01.460
like a friend, or an ex-boyfriend?

08:01.500 --> 08:03.460
I think that she had an accomplice.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.339
There was no-one she was close to.

08:05.380 --> 08:07.380
I didn't really ask about
boyfriends.

08:09.299 --> 08:11.140
There was a friend
from school, Charlotte.

08:11.179 --> 08:12.900
Mm-hm, Charlotte Clay.

08:12.940 --> 08:14.419
I'm going down for this, aren't I?

08:14.460 --> 08:17.219
No, you're not! Not if I've got
anything to do with it.

08:18.539 --> 08:21.299
She was always in control.
She'd plan everything.

08:21.339 --> 08:23.260
Did she write any of her plans down?
Not really.

08:23.299 --> 08:24.940
Did she keep stuff?
What do you mean?

08:24.979 --> 08:27.580
Could she have kept any evidence?
No, she threw things away.

08:30.099 --> 08:31.580
Most things, anyway.

08:31.620 --> 08:34.339
She kept her scrubs.
She had a thing for blood.

08:35.539 --> 08:36.620
What do you mean?

08:38.620 --> 08:40.380
She liked it.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.500
Sexually?
Yeah.

08:45.340 --> 08:46.779
Where does she keep those scrubs?

08:58.860 --> 09:01.299
We've got a witness to the disposal
of the murder weapon.

09:02.699 --> 09:05.220
A young male, walking his dog,
sees a van pull up,

09:05.260 --> 09:07.100
woman gets out,
chucks the mallet in the skip.

09:07.140 --> 09:08.380
Annabel.

09:08.419 --> 09:10.579
He hasn't picked her out
from any of the photographs.

09:10.620 --> 09:13.179
And he believes there was
a second person in the vehicle.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.740
Well, it wasn't Joe.

09:14.779 --> 09:16.380
I'm just being straight with you.

09:16.419 --> 09:19.819
We're still working on the
assumption they did this together.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.500
What if she did it
with somebody else,

09:21.539 --> 09:22.539
but it wasn't Joe?

09:22.579 --> 09:23.620
Who then?

09:23.659 --> 09:27.860
Joe told me that Annabel
has a fetish for blood.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.500
Erm, it turns her on.

09:29.539 --> 09:32.459
She's got a locker at the hospital
where she keeps her bloody scrubs.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.380
I'll check it out.

09:34.419 --> 09:36.579
What if she kept the clothes
she did the murder in?

09:36.620 --> 09:37.980
That's a huge risk.

09:40.819 --> 09:42.819
For Annabel, this is a game.

09:43.860 --> 09:45.860
It's all about the risk. The thrill.

09:47.579 --> 09:49.740
It's all part of the fun.

09:52.539 --> 09:55.220
If you wanna catch her,

09:55.260 --> 09:57.260
you've gotta try and understand her.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.900
So, Andy Bevan ended up here?

10:06.260 --> 10:09.620
Yeah, his burner phone
pinged in the centre of three masts,

10:09.659 --> 10:12.179
which locates him there.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.659
Talk about destroying the evidence.

10:30.140 --> 10:33.179
Right, right, shush, shush, shush,
everybody, shush, please!

10:33.220 --> 10:40.020
Cliff has been in this service
for 30 years now.

10:40.059 --> 10:42.299
And as well as teaching us all
to play chess

10:42.340 --> 10:44.819
and telling us what to read
on our holidays...

10:44.860 --> 10:47.819
Is that all I'm good for, is it,
book reviews and chess tips?

10:47.860 --> 10:51.260
I was about to say,
that we have all felt

10:51.299 --> 10:53.459
that we could go to you
if we had a problem.

10:55.459 --> 11:00.220
Cliff, you're as straight as a die,
and we're really gonna miss you.

11:01.579 --> 11:03.459
To Cliff, everybody.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.740
Good turn-out.

11:15.779 --> 11:18.260
Any excuse for a drink.

11:18.299 --> 11:20.819
And to distract
from Bevan's disappearance.

11:20.860 --> 11:22.740
Anything new, Ma'am?

11:24.299 --> 11:26.299
Come on.
I'm hardly going to leak, am I?

11:26.340 --> 11:28.020
I'm only here for one more day.

11:30.900 --> 11:33.220
We got a tip off
from a registered informant.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.939
He heard a man boasting
that he works at a crematorium,

11:35.980 --> 11:37.980
and he'd roasted a copper
out of hours.

11:39.020 --> 11:41.740
The burners at the crematorium
were on all night on the 31st.

11:43.340 --> 11:46.779
We're sifting through the ash,
but it's going to be a long job.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.220
Anything survive incineration?

11:52.579 --> 11:54.699
Hip bones and teeth, apparently.

12:07.539 --> 12:10.819
The coppers believed the crematorium
information you gave them.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.860
It's all there.

12:33.184 --> 12:34.184
Thanks.

13:26.223 --> 13:29.184
Yeah. It's a reunion,
for the leavers of 2011.

13:29.223 --> 13:31.463
We're still trying to get hold of
Charlotte Clay.

13:31.504 --> 13:35.504
Yeah, that's right. She left
just before her A-levels, actually,

13:35.544 --> 13:37.343
at the same time as Annabel Connors.

13:39.983 --> 13:42.144
Six sets of scrubs,
all blood-stained.

13:42.184 --> 13:44.863
Why would she keep them
in her locker?

13:44.904 --> 13:46.184
Get them to forensics.

13:46.223 --> 13:48.583
You never know, we might find
a match to Michael Connors.

13:51.024 --> 13:52.904
OK, yeah, not to worry.

13:52.943 --> 13:55.223
If you do hear from her,

13:55.264 --> 13:57.424
I wonder could you get her
to give me a call?

13:57.463 --> 13:59.463
Thank you, that's very helpful.

13:59.504 --> 14:00.983
Thank you, bye.

14:01.024 --> 14:02.583
What? What did she say?

14:02.623 --> 14:04.583
She bumped into Charlotte
at a Christmas fair.

14:04.623 --> 14:07.064
Charlotte makes furniture.

14:07.103 --> 14:09.904
Her married name
is Charlotte Hampton.

14:11.343 --> 14:13.463
She kept her card.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.623
It has her address on it.

14:17.384 --> 14:19.184
These are from her locker as well?

14:25.304 --> 14:27.304
Do a check on her.

14:31.024 --> 14:33.144
Let's bring her in.

14:38.743 --> 14:40.504
Be careful.

15:26.184 --> 15:27.784
Hi.

15:28.784 --> 15:31.144
Are you Charlotte Hampton?
Yeah, that's me.

15:31.184 --> 15:32.983
Sorry,
I thought this was your show room.

15:33.024 --> 15:34.784
No, that's in town.
Oh!

15:34.823 --> 15:38.504
Do you mind if I look around,
now that I'm here? Course not.

15:38.544 --> 15:40.544
Thank you.

15:42.943 --> 15:45.304
So, how long you been going?
Three years.

15:45.343 --> 15:47.343
What are you looking for?

15:47.384 --> 15:50.424
Erm, a new dining room table.

15:50.463 --> 15:53.144
Oh, we do them all to spec,
so you can have whatever you like.

15:53.184 --> 15:54.823
Sorry, it's a bit of a mess.

15:54.863 --> 15:57.024
A bit short on storage, aren't you?

15:57.064 --> 15:59.024
We had our van stolen a week
or so ago.

15:59.064 --> 16:00.384
Means we can't shift anything.

16:00.424 --> 16:01.983
I've got some samples inside.

16:03.264 --> 16:05.943
The catalogue's a bit out of date,
but you'll get an idea.

16:05.983 --> 16:07.583
Sorry about the mess.

16:07.623 --> 16:09.384
Argh! Get off me!

16:11.943 --> 16:14.664
Did you drive the van for Annabel?
Did you go in the house with her?

16:14.703 --> 16:16.983
Help her murder her parents?
Maybe you got off on that.

16:17.024 --> 16:18.823
What? It was nothing to do with me!

16:24.983 --> 16:26.103
Who are you?

16:26.144 --> 16:28.504
That doesn't matter. Just talk.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.304
I can't, she'll...

16:31.343 --> 16:33.144
I'll protect you,
don't worry about her.

16:34.823 --> 16:36.504
She said she needed the keys
to the van,

16:36.544 --> 16:38.823
that I shouldn't tell anyone.

16:38.863 --> 16:40.823
That if I did she, she'd...

16:42.103 --> 16:45.024
All that stuff at school,
it would ruin me if people knew.

16:45.064 --> 16:47.623
Yeah, well, you stole 10,000 quid,
didn't you?

16:47.664 --> 16:48.784
We paid it back.

16:48.823 --> 16:50.463
No, your parents paid it back.

16:50.504 --> 16:52.504
Bet Michael Connors was furious.

16:57.544 --> 16:58.784
Did he punish Annabel?

17:01.144 --> 17:02.223
How did you know?

17:02.264 --> 17:04.103
What did he do to her?

17:04.144 --> 17:06.304
He hit her with a belt.

17:10.064 --> 17:11.904
He was a horrible man.

17:13.263 --> 17:14.263
OK.

17:14.304 --> 17:17.143
OK, so, she takes the van,

17:17.183 --> 17:19.304
you know why she's taken it

17:19.343 --> 17:21.944
and you don't think it's a good idea
to go to the police?

17:21.983 --> 17:24.704
She said if I did, she'd hurt me.

17:24.743 --> 17:27.544
Is there anyone else
she's close to apart from you?

17:29.064 --> 17:30.784
Come on, Charlotte!

17:30.823 --> 17:31.823
Her brother.

17:31.863 --> 17:32.863
What, Martin?

17:32.903 --> 17:34.744
No, she thought he was an idiot.

17:34.784 --> 17:36.183
Adam?

17:38.784 --> 17:40.544
Tell me about Adam and Annabel.

17:45.863 --> 17:48.663
They were, they were close.

17:48.704 --> 17:52.343
He'd had a tough time
when he was young.

17:52.383 --> 17:54.383
She had too.

17:56.103 --> 17:58.103
You know, her mother dying.

18:00.143 --> 18:01.583
Right.

18:04.984 --> 18:06.984
He'd take us out from school.

18:11.623 --> 18:13.064
He seemed cool.

18:17.103 --> 18:18.464
Come on, Charlotte.

18:18.504 --> 18:20.623
Come on. What happened?

18:20.663 --> 18:22.064
You can tell me.

18:23.944 --> 18:26.544
He took us out one Sunday.

18:28.903 --> 18:30.903
He took us to the Lodge.

18:32.423 --> 18:33.784
There's a cellar there.

18:33.823 --> 18:37.623
It's kind of like
their secret place.

18:39.383 --> 18:41.383
They got me stoned.

18:42.863 --> 18:44.863
Started messing around
with each other.

18:48.124 --> 18:49.684
Got me to join in.

18:53.884 --> 18:56.124
She's in a sexual relationship
with her step-brother.

18:56.164 --> 18:57.684
What?
'And listen to this.'

18:57.723 --> 18:59.043
After the fraud at the school,

18:59.083 --> 19:00.924
Michael Connors beat Annabel
with a belt.

19:00.964 --> 19:02.283
He was a right bastard to her.

19:02.323 --> 19:03.444
Who told you all this?

19:03.483 --> 19:05.003
'Annabel's friend Charlotte Clay.'

19:05.043 --> 19:07.243
I'm bringing her in.
You shouldn't have spoken to her.

19:07.283 --> 19:10.404
Adam helped Annabel kill Michael
and Susan. I am sure of it.

19:10.444 --> 19:13.204
You need to stop. If this is true,
they could be dangerous.

19:13.243 --> 19:14.604
Fuck!

22:02.075 --> 22:04.368
Apparently the relationship
between Adam and Annabel

22:04.408 --> 22:05.567
has been going on a while.

22:05.608 --> 22:06.608
I don't believe it.

22:06.648 --> 22:08.807
Whoever this Charlotte is,
she's got it wrong.

22:08.847 --> 22:10.968
Did Adam get on OK with your mum?

22:11.007 --> 22:12.888
They got on fine.

22:12.928 --> 22:14.527
Fine. Is that all?

22:14.567 --> 22:16.527
We were grateful to her.

22:16.567 --> 22:18.408
Grateful?

22:18.448 --> 22:20.448
Martin, why grateful?

22:22.648 --> 22:24.408
We were small kids
when she took us in.

22:24.448 --> 22:26.247
We'd been in different foster homes.

22:26.287 --> 22:28.287
She got us back together.

22:28.327 --> 22:29.608
You and Adam were adopted?

22:29.648 --> 22:30.807
Yeah.

22:32.007 --> 22:33.128
By Susan.

22:34.208 --> 22:35.648
Yeah.

22:37.047 --> 22:39.047
I didn't know.

22:40.208 --> 22:42.648
So what was it like
when she married Michael?

22:42.688 --> 22:44.448
It was OK. He was...

22:44.487 --> 22:45.608
He was OK to us.

22:45.648 --> 22:46.807
And Adam got on with him?

22:46.847 --> 22:47.847
Of course!

22:47.888 --> 22:50.327
He gave him a job in the business,
didn't he? He liked Adam.

22:51.807 --> 22:54.448
If Annabel and Adam were together,
she'd tell me.

22:54.487 --> 22:56.208
She tells me everything.

22:57.408 --> 22:59.408
She wouldn't lie to me, would she?

23:00.847 --> 23:02.168
Where are they now, Martin?

23:04.688 --> 23:07.168
It's turn-around day at the lodge.

26:19.327 --> 26:21.087
Again, Adam.

26:26.608 --> 26:28.168
The thing about this place

26:28.208 --> 26:31.007
is you can see a car coming
from miles away.

26:32.287 --> 26:33.487
We saw yours.

26:33.527 --> 26:35.287
And it's not like
I didn't recognise it.

26:35.327 --> 26:37.168
You've been stalking me in it
for days!

26:37.208 --> 26:41.608
But still, I didn't think
you'd just walk in.

26:41.648 --> 26:43.767
No, actually, break in.

26:43.807 --> 26:47.807
What is that? Arrogance?
A superiority complex?

26:47.847 --> 26:49.847
Whatever, it's fucking stupid.

26:49.888 --> 26:52.087
People know I'm here.

26:52.128 --> 26:53.247
What people?

26:53.287 --> 26:55.408
Your friend Charlotte.

26:55.448 --> 26:57.888
Charlotte's a drip.
She won't let on.

26:57.928 --> 27:01.648
And anyway, even if people
did know you were coming,

27:01.688 --> 27:04.807
no-one saw you arrive,
apart from me and Adam.

27:06.247 --> 27:08.247
What happens to you down here,
Elizabeth,

27:08.287 --> 27:10.648
it's going to stay our secret.

27:12.807 --> 27:14.448
We didn't plan for you.

27:14.487 --> 27:16.487
We picked Joe well.

27:16.527 --> 27:19.688
We'd been looking for someone
for ages, and he fit brilliantly.

27:19.728 --> 27:23.928
He was so messed up
about the old girlfriend.

27:23.968 --> 27:26.247
So easy to set up.

27:26.287 --> 27:28.608
And then there was you.

27:28.648 --> 27:31.688
The one thing
he didn't tell me about.

27:31.728 --> 27:33.408
His mum, the copper.

27:33.448 --> 27:37.087
Adam, you stop this now,
I can get you a plea bargain.

27:38.928 --> 27:41.087
You don't get it.

27:41.128 --> 27:44.247
We've planned this together.

27:44.287 --> 27:47.968
You didn't have it in you
to kill Michael. I've seen the tape.

27:48.007 --> 27:51.448
And did Annabel drown Susan,
or was that you?

27:51.487 --> 27:53.007
We did it together.

27:53.047 --> 27:54.208
Why?

27:54.247 --> 27:56.928
She was a boring, annoying woman.

27:56.968 --> 27:59.128
And she drank too much.
They both did.

27:59.168 --> 28:00.448
It was disgusting.

28:00.487 --> 28:02.888
Your dad wouldn't give you
the trust fund money, would he?

28:02.928 --> 28:05.327
You do know that, don't you, Adam?
He knows.

28:12.608 --> 28:17.047
Don't try and turn us
against each other. It won't work.

28:17.087 --> 28:18.608
The thing people don't get

28:18.648 --> 28:22.847
is that killing
isn't about being angry or upset

28:22.888 --> 28:24.767
or wanting to get back at people.

28:24.807 --> 28:27.208
It's about being bored,
or annoyed,

28:27.247 --> 28:29.208
or having to get rid of someone
who's in your way.

28:29.247 --> 28:30.807
Which is why I'm going to kill you.

28:32.608 --> 28:34.087
Unzip her hoody.

28:46.567 --> 28:48.728
Yeah, lift up her jumper.

28:54.968 --> 28:57.648
I am making a cut
at the fifth intercostal muscle

28:57.688 --> 28:58.888
on the left side.

28:58.928 --> 29:01.368
No, stay still,
or I might cut the aorta.

29:07.128 --> 29:09.608
Hardly hurts at all, does it?

29:09.648 --> 29:12.247
But you're bleeding internally,
as well as externally.

29:12.287 --> 29:14.688
As the blood fills
the pericardial sac

29:14.728 --> 29:17.448
around your heart,
you'll go into cardiac tamponade.

29:17.487 --> 29:20.487
I'd say you'll be dead
in about...

29:23.368 --> 29:25.327
...55 minutes.

30:01.168 --> 30:03.287
We'll bury her on the moors.

30:03.327 --> 30:05.448
No.

30:05.487 --> 30:07.888
No, animals might find her.

30:07.928 --> 30:09.888
We'll put her down here somewhere.

30:09.928 --> 30:11.527
She'll smell.

30:11.567 --> 30:13.928
Not if we dig a deep enough hole.

30:15.408 --> 30:17.128
We'll put her in the coal cellar.

30:19.487 --> 30:21.487
What about all this blood?

30:21.527 --> 30:23.648
What are you going to do about that?

30:25.208 --> 30:28.087
You like the feel of it
on your skin, don't you Annabel?

30:32.567 --> 30:35.047
That doll, is it yours?

30:37.007 --> 30:38.968
From the day your mother died?

30:39.007 --> 30:41.567
Well done, Elizabeth. Top marks.

30:41.608 --> 30:43.608
I bet you got covered in it too,
didn't you?

30:46.928 --> 30:49.688
Most children would have run away,
but not you.

30:51.408 --> 30:53.408
No.

30:55.247 --> 30:57.247
I wonder...

30:59.608 --> 31:03.128
...if my blood will feel the same
as hers?

31:23.327 --> 31:26.608
What were you doing
when your father found you?

31:28.208 --> 31:30.047
I was making pictures.

31:33.888 --> 31:35.487
He was horrified, wasn't he?

31:36.807 --> 31:38.968
Didn't want to take you to see
a psychologist.

31:40.168 --> 31:42.168
Frightened of what
they might diagnose.

31:43.807 --> 31:48.007
A child who plays
in her mother's blood!

31:52.408 --> 31:54.408
He couldn't look at you.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.648
Couldn't bear to be near you.

32:03.968 --> 32:06.128
So he sends you away
to boarding school.

32:10.767 --> 32:12.527
Holds back your money.

32:16.408 --> 32:19.247
Warns nice boys like Joe
against you.

32:23.448 --> 32:25.448
And every time he looks at you...

32:27.767 --> 32:30.168
...you can just see it in his eyes.

32:32.087 --> 32:34.087
Fear.

32:36.487 --> 32:38.287
Horror.

32:42.247 --> 32:46.567
It just gets so... annoying.

32:49.888 --> 32:52.287
Your words, Annabel.

32:53.728 --> 32:55.728
Annoying.

32:58.247 --> 33:00.247
Boring.

33:02.128 --> 33:04.128
So you killed him.

33:07.487 --> 33:09.487
You're so clever.

33:15.168 --> 33:18.888
So fucking clever.

33:58.287 --> 34:00.287
It's no use running, Elizabeth!

34:01.327 --> 34:02.648
You're bleeding out, remember?

34:19.447 --> 34:21.208
Get away!

34:37.688 --> 34:39.847
You're gonna die down here,
Elizabeth.

35:09.367 --> 35:11.728
Hey, Elizabeth.

35:11.767 --> 35:13.407
Fun fact about blood.

35:13.447 --> 35:15.447
Did you know it makes up
about seven percent

35:15.488 --> 35:18.287
of the weight of the human body?

35:18.327 --> 35:22.528
So you're going to die lighter
than when you woke up this morning.

35:22.568 --> 35:24.327
Cool, eh?

35:26.847 --> 35:28.847
Mummy's blood was really dark.

35:28.887 --> 35:31.208
I know why now. It was deoxygenated.

35:31.247 --> 35:35.088
But then, it was this black liquid
pumping out of her.

35:36.927 --> 35:40.488
I put my hand on her neck,
tried to stop it.

35:42.807 --> 35:45.447
She died looking at me.

35:45.488 --> 35:47.367
I didn't know what to do.

35:48.728 --> 35:50.488
That's why I started playing.

35:52.648 --> 35:57.568
So, you're right,
that Daddy found me in the blood.

35:58.847 --> 36:02.088
Made me pray every day
to wash away my sins.

36:04.048 --> 36:06.048
I felt bad enough anyway.

36:06.088 --> 36:08.088
He didn't need to make it worse.

36:15.488 --> 36:17.488
Argh!

36:22.327 --> 36:24.447
You wouldn't kill me.

36:26.208 --> 36:27.967
Are you sure about that?

36:38.447 --> 36:40.447
Just do it.

36:42.488 --> 36:44.488
Just fucking do it!

37:56.156 --> 37:57.156
Thank you.

38:03.477 --> 38:05.356
When did they release you?
Yesterday.

38:07.716 --> 38:10.356
You've been unconscious
for nearly three days.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.557
I just can't believe
that Annabel and Adam...

38:14.597 --> 38:15.917
Don't.

38:17.316 --> 38:19.437
Don't think about it.

38:21.957 --> 38:23.796
How are you?

38:23.836 --> 38:26.156
I'm OK.

38:28.077 --> 38:30.756
I'm gonna be OK.

38:31.997 --> 38:33.037
Where are you staying?

38:36.316 --> 38:37.477
He's with me.

38:38.597 --> 38:42.356
Well, you know, you can come home.
Your old room's still there, so...

38:42.397 --> 38:48.156
Yeah. I'm gonna stay with Gran
for the moment.

38:50.316 --> 38:52.037
I will come and see you.

38:52.077 --> 38:54.037
It's just I need to get my shit
together

38:54.077 --> 38:55.836
and it will be easier at Gran's.

39:00.477 --> 39:03.477
OK, OK.

39:03.517 --> 39:06.957
Whatever works for you.

39:25.636 --> 39:27.796
Listen, Doctor,
it's been long enough.

39:27.836 --> 39:29.676
Look, I can walk, I can talk.

39:29.716 --> 39:31.716
I can probably
run a bloody marathon.

39:31.756 --> 39:32.796
Just let me out.

39:32.836 --> 39:34.557
One more day.

39:34.597 --> 39:36.316
I am going mad in here.

39:36.356 --> 39:38.997
You've got enough people
coming to see you.

39:39.037 --> 39:42.077
Your police colleague
was very insistent.

39:42.117 --> 39:43.557
What colleague?

39:45.437 --> 39:47.356
Got some reading to keep you amused.

39:47.397 --> 39:49.037
Look at you.

39:50.156 --> 39:51.636
So there was enough evidence, then?

39:52.957 --> 39:55.517
We got the belt,
found the bloodied clothes and shoes

39:55.557 --> 39:58.597
in the cellar room, with a match
to Michael's blood on them.

39:58.636 --> 40:00.236
Charlotte Hampton's admitted

40:00.276 --> 40:02.117
she gave Annabel
the keys to the vehicle.

40:02.156 --> 40:04.156
The video is a confession in itself.

40:04.196 --> 40:07.836
CPS are confident they can convict
both Adam and Annabel.

40:07.877 --> 40:10.597
Thank God for that.

40:10.636 --> 40:12.236
It's down to you.

40:12.276 --> 40:14.236
Well, you'd have got there
in the end.

40:14.276 --> 40:17.557
Sure, without a bullet
in my shoulder,

40:17.597 --> 40:18.957
and you ending up half dead.

40:18.997 --> 40:21.117
Well, I was in a hurry.

40:21.156 --> 40:23.917
We can't credit you
with any involvement.

40:23.957 --> 40:26.236
I don't want to give the defence
anything to play with.

40:26.276 --> 40:27.756
I don't want any credit.

40:27.796 --> 40:29.997
I got Joe out of prison,
That's all that matters.

40:30.037 --> 40:31.477
How's he doing?

40:31.517 --> 40:34.397
Yeah, he's good, he's good.

40:34.437 --> 40:35.517
Yeah, he will be.

40:36.557 --> 40:37.557
And you?

40:38.957 --> 40:40.236
Never better.

40:43.957 --> 40:47.077
Annabel told me she goaded you,

40:47.117 --> 40:49.117
saying you wouldn't kill her.

40:50.957 --> 40:53.796
And you said, "You sure about that?"

40:57.477 --> 40:58.796
I was just trying to scare her.

40:58.836 --> 41:00.517
That's all?

41:02.276 --> 41:03.756
I didn't kill her, did I?

41:06.676 --> 41:08.356
No, you didn't.

41:11.316 --> 41:13.316
But death seems to follow you.

41:16.517 --> 41:17.836
What does that mean?

41:17.877 --> 41:21.597
I'm not sure, to be honest.

41:21.636 --> 41:23.517
Well, just drop it, then.

41:24.557 --> 41:28.196
Well, the thing is,
I find that I can't.

41:31.836 --> 41:33.196
You can't what?

41:35.437 --> 41:37.037
It's all part of the same thing,

41:37.077 --> 41:39.477
but I find I can't stop
thinking about you.

My God!

42:17.077 --> 42:18.997
Here you go. Get this down you.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.477
What are you like?

42:23.477 --> 42:24.877
Are you off sick leave now?

42:24.917 --> 42:26.676
What sick leave, eh?

42:26.716 --> 42:28.557
The Chief Constable
wants to see you.

42:28.597 --> 42:30.196
OK, sure, grab hold of that.

42:30.236 --> 42:32.716
And you...

42:43.037 --> 42:44.597
Morning, Frances.

42:46.756 --> 42:48.557
Elizabeth Bancroft,
I'm arresting you

42:48.597 --> 42:51.356
for conspiracy to murder
Detective Sergeant Andrew Bevan.

42:51.397 --> 42:52.796
What? What are you talking about?

42:52.836 --> 42:55.196
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

42:55.236 --> 42:58.236
if you do not mention something
you later rely on in court.

42:58.276 --> 42:59.517
Wait, is this a joke?

42:59.557 --> 43:02.037
Superintendent Walker
found your burner phone.

43:02.077 --> 43:04.236
I came to the hospital.

43:04.276 --> 43:06.156
You were sleeping so peacefully.

43:06.196 --> 43:07.917
You searched my stuff?

43:10.236 --> 43:11.236
I was half dead.

43:11.276 --> 43:14.316
I'd been attacked
by a couple of psychos.

43:14.356 --> 43:16.597
I wouldn't bandy that word around.
Fuck off, Cliff.

43:16.636 --> 43:19.636
Look, all right, listen,
I admit it,

43:19.676 --> 43:21.877
I was running Daanish
as an informer,

43:21.917 --> 43:23.557
and Andy Bevan was helping me.

43:23.597 --> 43:25.877
I trusted you, Elizabeth,
believed in you.

43:25.917 --> 43:29.796
You wanted the drug figures down
and that's how we did it, all right?

43:29.836 --> 43:33.356
But I have got nothing to do with
Andy's disappearance.

43:33.397 --> 43:34.477
Murder.

43:34.517 --> 43:37.676
His DNA's been found
in the crematorium.

43:37.716 --> 43:40.636
Your phones revealed how much
you were in contact with Kamara

43:40.676 --> 43:41.836
the night he was killed.

43:41.877 --> 43:44.716
Cliff has had it in for me
for years.

43:44.756 --> 43:48.117
OK? This is fucking bullshit.

43:48.156 --> 43:50.316
I mean, why would
I want Andy Bevan dead?

43:50.356 --> 43:51.877
Why?
He was blackmailing you.

43:51.917 --> 43:54.077
Where are you even getting
this information, Cliff?

43:55.037 --> 43:56.276
We offered a deal,

43:56.316 --> 44:00.077
and Daanish Kamara's been much more
helpful than you'd imagine.

44:03.517 --> 44:05.077
Daanish is lying. He's lying!

44:05.117 --> 44:06.517
Tell it to a lawyer.

44:06.557 --> 44:08.716
You would believe a criminal's word
over mine,

44:08.756 --> 44:11.716
after everything I have
done for this force?

44:11.756 --> 44:12.796
You're the criminal!

44:12.836 --> 44:16.557
You're lying, corrupt and depraved.

44:16.597 --> 44:18.877
You're a cold blooded killer.

44:18.917 --> 44:20.037
Fuck you, Cliff!

44:20.077 --> 44:22.477
Fucking get off!

44:22.517 --> 44:24.437
I'm fucking gonna kill you!

44:24.477 --> 44:26.437
Why wouldn't you just leave it,
Cliff?

44:26.477 --> 44:28.397
Why wouldn't you just leave it?

44:28.437 --> 44:31.117
Get the fuck off me!

44:32.236 --> 44:34.236
What you staring at?

44:35.316 --> 44:37.517
Get off me!

44:59.597 --> 45:01.597
Pig! Pig! Pig! Pig!
