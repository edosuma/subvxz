00:12.546 --> 00:14.482
Yes, I know, baby bear.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.584
Come on, we're gonna
get in the car

00:16.617 --> 00:18.119
And get in our
princess seat.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.725
But he might be
coming back.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.227
He's not coming back,
Miles.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.528
You read the note.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.563
And even if he did,
we're not gonna be here.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.134
Where are we going?

00:33.167 --> 00:35.336
As far as Jack'll
take us.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.206
Why do you call
the car "Jack"?

00:38.239 --> 00:41.575
'Cause it rhymes
with Cadillac.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.611
Come on, get in the car,
put on your seat belts.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.313
Let's go.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.549
(Girl)
You ready to go
on a trip, Lilee?

01:08.569 --> 01:10.070
(Horn honking)

01:15.676 --> 01:17.311
(Miles)
Which way are we going?

01:17.345 --> 01:18.512
(Woman)
North.

01:18.546 --> 01:19.780
How far north?

01:19.813 --> 01:21.682
(Girl)
The North Pole?

01:21.715 --> 01:23.751
No, not that far north.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.129
(Birds chirping)

01:35.163 --> 01:36.630
(Bells jingling)

02:11.232 --> 02:13.133
(Girl)
It looks like
no job here, either.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.207
Hello!

02:19.240 --> 02:20.808
All right,
put your seat belts on.

02:23.211 --> 02:24.612
And then Santa came

02:24.645 --> 02:26.847
And the family had
the best Christmas ever.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.349
(Girl)
Tell us another one.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.450
Oh, tomorrow, honey,

02:29.483 --> 02:32.353
I don't want to
use 'em all up today.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.654
I miss home.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.356
Well, we'll find
a better one.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.291
(Miles)
We never should have left.

02:37.325 --> 02:40.160
No, we shouldn't have
stayed as long as we did.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.508
Mama, I gotta go.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.434
It'll be okay, Mama.

03:20.468 --> 03:21.869
How do you know?

03:21.902 --> 03:23.237
I said a prayer.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.606
A... a lot of good
that'll do.

03:25.639 --> 03:28.376
Hey, Miles,
it couldn't hurt.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.344
Mama, you're strong.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.945
Thank you, sweetheart.

03:31.979 --> 03:35.516
Remember what Pastor Woolery
used to say.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.717
What?

03:36.750 --> 03:38.319
"Women are like tea bags.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.620
"You never know
how strong they are

03:39.653 --> 03:41.922
Until you put 'em in
hot water."

03:41.955 --> 03:43.791
Or how dumb.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.036
(Bell dinging)

04:49.122 --> 04:50.324
(Woman sighing)

04:50.358 --> 04:51.759
We gotta find a motel.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.562
Mama, I gotta go.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.898
Oh-oh... why-why didn't you go
when we stopped last time?

04:57.931 --> 05:00.067
'Cause I didn't
have to go then!

05:00.100 --> 05:01.502
Okay.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.340
You do?

05:08.676 --> 05:10.378
Okay, thanks.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.392
Okay.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.361
Okay.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.096
The motel has a vacancy.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.031
I thought Dad
took all the money.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.933
Well, I had some
he didn't know about.

05:32.966 --> 05:33.967
Why'd he take it?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.604
'Cause that's
what lowlifes do.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.573
I mean, maybe he needed some
for himself, right?

05:39.607 --> 05:42.976
Yeah, probably needed it
for his lady friend.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.445
(Giggling)

05:44.478 --> 05:46.480
Yeah.

05:46.514 --> 05:50.017
Well, the motel's not far,
so... buckle up.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.389
(Man)
No pets neither.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.824
(Woman)
We don't have any pets.

05:56.857 --> 05:57.991
I could give you
a better rate

05:58.025 --> 06:00.127
If you stayed
the whole week.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.463
With Christmas and all,
we don't get much traffic.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.864
Do you need any
help around here?

06:03.897 --> 06:05.599
Nah, wife does it.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.100
Mama, I gotta go!

06:07.134 --> 06:08.902
I'm coming.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.170
Trudy may be looking
for a waitress

06:10.203 --> 06:11.672
To handle
the graveyard.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.040
That's what I hear.
Who?

06:13.073 --> 06:14.442
Trudy Willis.

06:14.475 --> 06:18.446
She owns the Model A Cafe,
south end of town.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.414
Okay.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.849
Thank you.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.120
But, Mama, I gotta go!

06:27.154 --> 06:28.656
Well, you're just
gonna have to hold it.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.058
That's what I've been doing
and I can't anymore!

06:31.091 --> 06:33.827
Does she have to
be by us?

06:33.861 --> 06:35.496
A diaper!

06:35.529 --> 06:36.797
(Giggling)

06:43.170 --> 06:45.739
I can't afford to hire
anyone right now.

06:45.773 --> 06:46.940
Please, I've tried
every town

06:46.974 --> 06:48.175
Between here
and the state line.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.977
I've got to find something.
I understand that.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.845
No, I'll work for
half the wages.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.447
You don't understand.

06:53.481 --> 06:56.149
I can't afford to
hire anyone.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.954
She's re-really gotta go.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.956
Okay, do you have
a restroom she can use?

07:02.990 --> 07:04.525
Sure, come here.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.495
What are you drawing,
Lilee?

07:07.528 --> 07:09.429
Oh, what color is it?

07:12.566 --> 07:14.835
How about I work for whatever
you can afford and tips?

07:14.868 --> 07:16.604
How about that?

07:18.005 --> 07:19.840
I can only afford
minimum wage

07:19.873 --> 07:22.876
And we'll see how
it goes 'til Christmas.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.745
Thank you, thank you!

07:24.778 --> 07:27.147
Oh, you won't
regret it.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.049
I already do.
Oh, thank you!

07:30.618 --> 07:31.919
Hi, Lilee.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.623
Well, this probably
won't last long anyway.

07:35.656 --> 07:36.824
What's that?

07:36.857 --> 07:39.092
Oh, I said
I can't wait that long.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.695
I need you to start
tonight.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.631
Tonight, tonight?

07:43.664 --> 07:45.733
Oh, um, all right,
let me get the kids

07:45.766 --> 07:46.934
Squared away then.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.103
Mac and cheese leftover
from lunch.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.705
For the children.

07:51.739 --> 07:54.007
Really?
Thank you.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.275
You'll need to wear this.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.511
It's not chic,
but it's clean.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.747
Great, thank you.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.715
You're a good person,
Mrs. Willis.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.851
Yeah, well, don't let
that get around, okay?

08:03.884 --> 08:06.019
I'll see you soon.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.721
I thought you
weren't hiring.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.189
I'm not.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.591
Now.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.264
Do I smell smoke?

08:17.297 --> 08:20.000
Well, where there's smoke,
there's dinner.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.308
Who's gonna
stay with us?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.810
Well, I think Miles is

08:29.843 --> 08:31.812
Responsible enough
for that now.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.681
Do I get paid, too?

08:33.714 --> 08:35.515
One thing at a time.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.284
And, Miles, I'm really
counting on you.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.654
You are in the fifth grade
and you're old enough.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.722
Should be in sixth.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.224
We've been
through all that.

08:44.256 --> 08:46.159
I held you back so you could
take better care of yourself.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.295
And not get beat up
by bullies.

08:48.328 --> 08:51.198
Mel, less talk,
more eat, please.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.834
Okay, I'm gonna give you
the number of the cafe.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.669
If you need me,
you go to the office

08:55.703 --> 08:57.037
And you use the pay phone,
okay?

08:57.070 --> 08:58.572
Okay.
Here you go.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.840
I love you.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.675
You got change?
Yeah.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.143
No story tonight?

09:03.176 --> 09:05.579
I'll tell you
two tomorrow.

09:05.613 --> 09:06.880
Come here, sweetie.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.682
Say bye-byes.
Bye-bye!

09:08.716 --> 09:11.284
I love you, oh.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.886
She might need to
go to bed early.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.054
Okay, bye.

09:15.823 --> 09:18.191
(Mel)
Love you.
Call me if you
need anything.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.295
Mama trusts you.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.231
She's not my mom.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.666
She is now.

09:25.699 --> 09:29.236
No, she just married my dad,
that's all.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.038
(Lilee)
She's my mommy, too.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.912
(Bells jingling)

09:42.182 --> 09:44.952
Hey, take a picture,
it'll last longer!

09:47.888 --> 09:49.823
Martha, right?
Uh, yeah.

09:49.857 --> 09:50.924
Lola.
Hi.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.325
Welcome.
Thank you.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.761
Oh, and don't mind them.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.328
The only thing
they like looking at better

09:55.362 --> 09:58.699
Than a new woman in town
is a new tractor.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.100
Oh.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.169
Trudy likes all of us
to wear those.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.737
Oh, yeah, all of us.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.739
Yeah, you, me,
and me and you.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.240
Yeah, right.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.176
You catch on quick.

10:09.209 --> 10:12.646
That's a first around here,
an actual IQ.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.881
Thank you.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.215
Where can
I put my stuff?

10:15.248 --> 10:17.250
Just in back.
All right, thank you.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.854
You know what we need?

10:20.888 --> 10:22.923
No, and I don't
want to.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.024
A tree.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.993
It's almost Christmas.
Why?

10:26.026 --> 10:28.829
There won't be any
Ch-Ch-Christmas for us.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.330
Yes, there will.

10:30.363 --> 10:31.965
Have it by
the door.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.001
How would we open it?

10:34.034 --> 10:35.869
Oh, yeah.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.104
By the bed?

10:37.137 --> 10:40.440
F-f-forget the stupid tree
and go to sleep.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.910
It's not stupid,
and you go to sleep.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.345
You're not the boss of me.
I am tonight.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.947
Then you have to
tell a story.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.448
I don't know any.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.851
You must know one.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.421
Oh!

10:58.358 --> 10:59.693
Here you go.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.797
Trudy finally broke down
and hired a regular, huh?

11:03.831 --> 11:05.966
Jim, you no talk
like that.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.234
I didn't mean
nothing by it.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.302
Well, that's me, just
a broken-down regular.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.470
Don't listen to him.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.039
He's loco.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.807
Yeah, well, I've never seen
anybody order enchiladas

11:13.841 --> 11:15.108
Smothered in gravy.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.745
You ain't lived, darlin'.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.314
I don't know
any stories, Mel.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.751
Go to sleep.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.285
Not even
a Christmas story?

11:25.318 --> 11:26.920
No.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.757
All right,
then I'll tell you one.

11:32.125 --> 11:36.096
It was Christmas Eve
a really long time ago,

11:36.129 --> 11:38.065
So long ago

11:38.098 --> 11:41.501
That it wasn't even
called Christmas yet.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.371
It's always been called
Chr-Christmas.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.874
Not the first one.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.441
His name was Joe.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.477
That's what
people called him.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.479
It was short for Joseph.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.347
Aye!

11:54.381 --> 11:57.150
And she was Mary

11:57.184 --> 11:59.753
And she was
going to have a baby

11:59.787 --> 12:03.123
And all the animals they
passed knew who she was.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.826
Give me a break.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.829
And when Mary
and Joe passed by them,

12:08.862 --> 12:10.497
The sheep would go "baaa"

12:10.530 --> 12:12.833
And the donkey went
"hee-haw,"

12:12.866 --> 12:14.835
And the dog, "woof."

12:14.868 --> 12:17.137
I know how animals sound.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.339
That was because
the animals knew

12:19.372 --> 12:22.342
Her baby was
going to be very special.

12:22.375 --> 12:26.313
He was going to be the most
special baby ever born.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.215
He was going to be a king,

12:28.248 --> 12:30.350
But nobody
knew it yet

12:30.383 --> 12:33.954
And he was going to
save people.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.189
Good people, bad people,

12:36.223 --> 12:39.426
Kids, grownups...
Everybody.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.872
(Martha)
I thought my marriage
was made in heaven.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.540
Well, marriages
are made in heaven,

12:53.573 --> 12:56.209
But so is thunder
and lightning.

12:56.243 --> 12:57.410
(Laughing)

12:57.444 --> 12:59.446
True.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.148
Martha.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.883
I haven't heard
an old-fashioned name

13:02.916 --> 13:04.084
Like that in a while.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.219
It was my
grandmother's name.

13:06.253 --> 13:09.522
It's a derivation of Mary,
you know.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.492
Mother Mary
at Christmastime.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.929
Maybe the mother part.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.899
So is Trudy having a hard time
keeping this place open?

13:18.932 --> 13:21.969
Well, when the economy tanks,
people don't eat out as much.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.037
Yeah, it's
a small town, huh?

13:24.071 --> 13:26.173
Phone book has one page.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.341
Wow, what about
the regulars?

13:28.375 --> 13:31.011
They keep the place
going.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.612
I met the Carnes.
Mm-hmm.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.181
They seem like
really nice people.

13:34.214 --> 13:37.384
Oh, all our regulars are,
if you don't count Les.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.920
Les?

13:39.953 --> 13:42.222
McCallum, local cattleman.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.024
Cranky?

13:44.057 --> 13:45.425
Babies are cranky,

13:45.458 --> 13:48.929
Les is miserable,
like an old hamburger patty

13:48.962 --> 13:51.164
Fizzing and sputtering
in his own grease.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.200
Ew.
Ugh.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.302
Who else should
I look out for?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.070
Joe Hopkins.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.973
Oh, yeah,
he's miserable, too?

14:00.007 --> 14:01.441
No, just the opposite.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.218
Hey.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.387
Okay.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.392
You probably want coffee.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.228
Hot chocolate, actually.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.595
Okay.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.167
(Machine whirring)

14:33.506 --> 14:35.175
Here you go.
Thank you.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.482
Oh, can I get you
anything else?

14:42.515 --> 14:44.451
(Lola)
Piece of lemon meringue pie.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.420
And a piece of
lemon meringue pie.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.989
Coming right up.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.663
How is it?

14:56.696 --> 14:58.631
I have no idea.

14:58.665 --> 14:59.967
Can I get a fork?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.434
Oh, yeah.

15:03.470 --> 15:04.604
Fork?

15:10.643 --> 15:12.312
(Woman)
Mrs. Evans?

15:12.345 --> 15:14.347
Carol Ann Bullington from
over at the motel.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.615
Owen's wife.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.284
Yeah, what can
I do for you?

15:17.317 --> 15:19.119
There's been
a little problem,

15:19.152 --> 15:20.653
Kind of an accident
in your room.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.089
Are the kids okay?

15:22.122 --> 15:23.123
Kids are fine.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.625
Best you come see
for yourself.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.228
Um, Lola, I gotta go,
something's come up.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.470
Who's gonna pay
for this?

15:37.504 --> 15:38.738
What is it?

15:38.771 --> 15:39.672
What happened?

15:39.706 --> 15:41.074
What happened?

15:41.108 --> 15:42.609
I'll tell you
what happened.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.345
The toilet overflowed
and you ruined my carpet.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.580
Oh.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.250
It's worth probably...
100.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.551
No, it ain't.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.021
You told me you was gonna
rip it out next week.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.223
Not now, Carol Ann.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.658
Are you trying to take
advantage of this nice lady?

15:58.691 --> 16:01.328
Ain't happening, Owen.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.729
That boy...

16:02.762 --> 16:05.198
Is not old enough to
take care of 'em.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.567
Now you find
someone who can,

16:07.600 --> 16:11.271
Or I will throw out
the lot of you!

16:11.304 --> 16:13.673
The only thing you're gonna
throw out is your belly.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.279
It's like being married to
a cement mixer.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.648
Good night, Owen.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.021
Good night, Carol Ann.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.361
His bark is worse
than his bite.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.695
Where am I gonna
find a sitter

16:35.728 --> 16:38.665
That will work
late and for cheap?

16:38.698 --> 16:40.533
I got a stepdaughter,
Jeanie.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.235
She's about 16.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.137
I'll... I'll see
if she can do it.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.273
Really?
Don't worry.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.675
It'll be all right.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.643
Good night, honey.
Thank you.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.145
Sleep tight.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.662
How... how does
a three-year-old

17:09.695 --> 17:12.232
Get all that in there?

17:12.265 --> 17:15.068
She's stronger
than she looks.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.403
Didn't you put her
to sleep?

17:16.435 --> 17:20.140
Yeah, she just
didn't... stay there.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.473
In my office now.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.344
You, out.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.780
Miles...

17:27.814 --> 17:29.749
She was your
responsibility.

17:29.782 --> 17:33.386
She's l-l-like
a ninja baby.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.822
She was asleep when I...

17:35.855 --> 17:38.291
Fell asleep?
Yeah.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.527
Look, I know
you were tired,

17:40.560 --> 17:42.562
But babies, they get up in
the middle of the night

17:42.595 --> 17:44.431
And it's my fault
for not having a crib,

17:44.464 --> 17:47.867
But...

17:47.900 --> 17:49.569
You really need to be
more cautious

17:49.602 --> 17:50.703
With your little sister.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.439
She's not my sister!

17:52.472 --> 17:54.107
Half-sister, then.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.475
If we would have
stayed home

17:55.508 --> 17:58.145
And wa-wa-wa...
And waited for Dad,

17:58.178 --> 17:59.546
This would not have
happened!

17:59.579 --> 18:02.715
No, if we had stayed home,
we would still be waiting.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.685
He's not coming back, Miles...
I'm sorry... ever.

18:05.718 --> 18:06.686
I hate this!

18:06.719 --> 18:09.222
I hate you
for doing this!

18:09.256 --> 18:10.523
(Mel coughing)

18:10.557 --> 18:11.691
You were listening?

18:11.724 --> 18:12.692
Hearing.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.627
There's a difference.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.229
(Miles)
None of your business.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.298
You aren't even my sisters!
Fine.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.632
Be that way.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.835
(Owl hooting)

18:39.652 --> 18:41.921
It'll be okay, Mama.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.856
Oh.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.359
You should be in bed,
sweetie.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.662
God won't forget us at
Christmas.

18:49.696 --> 18:53.533
No, no.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.801
Not you.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.270
But I think he wrote me off
a long time ago.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.439
No, he doesn't
work like that.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.441
God kinda makes you
worry a while,

19:01.474 --> 19:03.410
Until you get some faith,

19:03.443 --> 19:06.379
And then later,
you believe in Him.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.350
See?

19:10.383 --> 19:11.818
Only you gotta
pray, though.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.456
Oh.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.359
I don't think I'm very good
at that, either.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.893
That's the easy part.

19:20.927 --> 19:24.331
You don't have to be,
you just have to do it.

19:26.966 --> 19:30.403
How did you
get so smart?

19:30.437 --> 19:31.771
Always have been.

19:31.804 --> 19:32.839
You'll see.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.608
This will be
the best Christmas ever.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.244
I love you.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.748
I love you, too,
baby girl.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.333
Can't we w-wait
'til after Christmas?

20:00.367 --> 20:02.469
No, because I want you
to get to know your teachers

20:02.502 --> 20:03.870
Before the term starts.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.872
And the kids.
Yeah.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.474
That's what worries me.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.944
Look, Miles.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.314
This is a chance
for you to start over.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.317
It doesn't have to be like
it was before, okay?

20:17.350 --> 20:18.951
They'll make
fun of me.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.721
The way I look,
the way I talk.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.626
Look.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.429
You need to stand up
for yourself.

20:29.462 --> 20:32.765
You need to be
proud of who you are.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.735
When you show
them that...

20:35.768 --> 20:37.704
They'll respect you.

20:37.737 --> 20:41.841
They'd respect me more
if I was a karate master.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.976
But you're not.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.012
You are you.

20:46.045 --> 20:49.048
And you are someone
worth knowing.

20:49.081 --> 20:52.051
Just show them that.

20:52.084 --> 20:55.322
Whatever.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.789
Promise?

20:56.823 --> 20:59.959
It won't do any good.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.728
Then again, it might.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.496
Let's go.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.634
(School bell ringing)

21:09.101 --> 21:11.070
First and last?

21:11.103 --> 21:12.639
How much is that?

21:12.672 --> 21:14.374
Is it furnished,
by any chance?

21:14.407 --> 21:15.975
Would you consider
any less?

21:16.008 --> 21:18.311
Okay.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.446
That's out.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.649
Would you consider
any less?

21:22.682 --> 21:24.551
That's okay, all right.

21:24.584 --> 21:25.852
That's out.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.987
Yes, I'm calling about
the house

21:28.020 --> 21:29.489
That you have for rent.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.691
Three children
and one adult.

21:31.724 --> 21:32.825
No, no pets.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.394
That's out.

21:34.427 --> 21:37.530
Well, we just moved here
and we're not settled, so...

21:37.564 --> 21:38.765
Okay.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.335
Oh, man.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.704
Okay.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.005
Do you want something
to eat, baby?

21:46.038 --> 21:47.574
Here, come here.

21:50.810 --> 21:51.944
Let's hug.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.315
You go to sleep.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.902
(Giggling)

22:35.588 --> 22:37.690
Oh, my gosh, Lilee.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.495
Oh, my gosh!

22:42.529 --> 22:44.597
You are a ninja baby.

22:44.631 --> 22:45.798
Oh, what a mess.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.103
Heard you had some
trouble last night.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.939
Oh, hi.

22:52.972 --> 22:57.043
I did, but, um,
everything's okay.

22:57.076 --> 23:00.012
Glad... glad to hear it.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.549
Are you always on duty?

23:02.582 --> 23:04.116
No, I just
started a shift.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.985
It's the afternoon.

23:06.018 --> 23:08.988
I'm sorry, it sounds like
I was grilling you.

23:09.021 --> 23:11.858
Were you?

23:11.891 --> 23:15.628
No, I mean, I just...

23:15.662 --> 23:17.129
Just met you
at 3:00 a.m.

23:17.163 --> 23:21.534
And now I'm seeing you again,
and so it just seems like...

23:21.568 --> 23:24.537
I don't know,
like you're always working.

23:24.571 --> 23:25.938
Not always.

23:25.972 --> 23:28.207
I'm sure your wife
wouldn't like that anyway.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.109
Yeah, no,
she wouldn't.

23:30.142 --> 23:32.111
If I had one.
Oh.

23:33.580 --> 23:34.881
That's life.

23:37.584 --> 23:40.487
I guess it's not always
like the brochure, right?

23:40.520 --> 23:41.954
No, no.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.458
(Sighing)

23:45.492 --> 23:48.861
Um, are you
gonna stay here?

23:48.895 --> 23:50.129
At the motel?

23:50.162 --> 23:51.931
I hope not.

23:51.964 --> 23:55.668
I'm sort of hoping to find
a house that I could afford,

23:55.702 --> 23:59.939
But it doesn't look like
that's gonna happen.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.608
There's not
a lot out there.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.175
Did you talk to
Don Meyer?

24:03.209 --> 24:04.477
Who?

24:04.511 --> 24:06.145
Oh, he's the local property
manager.

24:06.178 --> 24:09.649
I'm sure he can find
something in your price range.

24:09.682 --> 24:12.151
You mean
no price range?

24:12.184 --> 24:13.986
I'm sure he can
find something.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.856
He's got
special help, you know?

24:18.725 --> 24:20.627
No.

24:20.660 --> 24:21.694
Right.

24:21.728 --> 24:23.963
He's... he's the local pastor
as well.

24:23.996 --> 24:26.799
Oh, well.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.568
Doubt he'd like to help
a heathen like me.

24:28.601 --> 24:32.004
I haven't been to
church since I was ten.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.139
Gotta help heathens
once in a while

24:33.172 --> 24:34.941
Or he wouldn't
have a congregation.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.176
Yeah.

24:37.209 --> 24:42.882
I can ask him to drop by
the cafe if you want.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.685
I would
appreciate that, yeah.

24:45.718 --> 24:48.988
Thank you.
You're welcome.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.791
Um, it's...
Martha.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.727
Right.
Evans.

24:54.761 --> 24:57.063
Now we're formally
introduced.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.698
Yes, we are.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.903
I guess today's
my lucky day.

25:03.936 --> 25:06.806
Thanks to you, everything's
coming my way.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.575
You know,
in my line of work,

25:08.608 --> 25:11.210
If it's going your
direction,

25:11.243 --> 25:13.112
You're in the wrong lane.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.647
That's true.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.282
Yeah, that's
a really bad cop joke.

25:16.315 --> 25:19.185
Um, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.553
Thanks.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.154
Same here.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.198
Wouldn't mind
getting a ticket from him.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.102
Hey!

25:36.135 --> 25:38.671
See you tomorrow.
Bye!

25:38.705 --> 25:40.039
Oh!

25:40.072 --> 25:41.107
How was your first day?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.274
Good!

25:42.308 --> 25:43.876
I did the best
in spelling today.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.713
Teacher said I was a good
condition to the class.

25:46.746 --> 25:49.882
"Addition," you're a good
addition to the class.

25:49.916 --> 25:50.883
That's great.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.284
All right, how about you,
Miles?

25:52.318 --> 25:53.285
How were you today?

25:53.319 --> 25:54.721
It's school.

25:54.754 --> 25:55.755
Right, of course.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.289
What was I thinking?

25:57.323 --> 25:58.891
Listen, I owe you
a big apology.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.326
For what?

26:00.359 --> 26:03.696
For coming down so hard on you
when you were watching Lilee.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.932
See, today she managed to
spread peanut butter and jelly

26:05.965 --> 26:07.934
All over the room while
I was sleeping.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.101
(Giggling)

26:09.135 --> 26:10.369
Forgiven?

26:10.402 --> 26:12.271
How about even?

26:12.304 --> 26:14.607
That works for me.

26:14.641 --> 26:15.975
Thank you.

26:17.677 --> 26:20.046
(Video game noises)

26:24.316 --> 26:25.852
Oh...

26:27.720 --> 26:29.656
Oh.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.924
Oh, why'd you let me
sleep so long?

26:31.958 --> 26:33.192
You were tired.

26:33.225 --> 26:34.794
Oh, that's no excuse.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.362
I've used it before.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.097
Oh, I gotta get some
dinner going.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.298
Pizza?

26:39.331 --> 26:42.268
No, I can't afford
that right now, honey.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.670
Ta-da, ramen.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.738
Again?

26:45.772 --> 26:48.875
Well, as soon
as I get paid,

26:48.908 --> 26:50.777
I promise, I'll get us
some real groceries?

26:50.810 --> 26:52.044
Why?

26:52.078 --> 26:54.246
We don't even
have a fridge.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.115
Well, I'm working on that.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.250
How about... tree?

26:58.284 --> 27:00.252
Mama, we do
need a tree.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.789
Yeah, well, I'm sure
wherever we're going,

27:02.822 --> 27:04.256
There'll be lots of trees
in the yard.

27:04.290 --> 27:07.794
No, a Christmas tree.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.962
Here?
Yeah.

27:09.996 --> 27:13.800
No, I...

27:13.833 --> 27:15.735
I can't afford
a Christmas tree

27:15.768 --> 27:18.437
And we don't even have anything
to put on it anyway,

27:18.470 --> 27:20.439
And I'm sure
Bullington would have a cow

27:20.472 --> 27:22.174
If we brought a tree
in here.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.677
A cow would take more
room than a tree.

27:24.711 --> 27:25.878
You do need a cow.

27:25.912 --> 27:27.113
(Knocking)

27:27.146 --> 27:28.948
Uh, no on the tree.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.050
How about...
How about the star?

27:32.719 --> 27:34.386
Hi.
(girl)
Hi, I'm Jeanie.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.122
Yes, Jeanie,
come on in.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.258
(Martha)
Mel, come here, Jeanie's here.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.027
I want you to meet her.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.429
Hi, I'm Mary Ellen,
but you can call me Mel.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.865
Okay.

27:45.898 --> 27:48.434
Mrs. Evans?
Mm-hmm.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.936
Oh, it's Martha,
actually.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.971
Oh, um, Martha.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.941
My dad wanted me to ask you
about the money.

27:54.974 --> 27:56.108
Right.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.744
Of course, the money.

27:57.777 --> 28:01.781
Um, right, straight to
business, that's smart.

28:01.814 --> 28:06.485
See, I've only just started
at the cafe, so...

28:06.518 --> 28:08.387
Heard you're working
at the Root Beer.

28:08.420 --> 28:11.891
The... Trudy's Model A,
right?

28:11.924 --> 28:13.125
Same thing.

28:13.159 --> 28:14.894
Used to be called
The Root Beer Drive-In.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.896
Had the best homemade
root beer anywhere.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.297
Oh.

28:18.330 --> 28:21.000
Well...

28:21.033 --> 28:23.302
I can only pay you
$2 an hour

28:23.335 --> 28:26.238
And I know that's
under minimum wage

28:26.272 --> 28:28.174
Um...

28:28.207 --> 28:29.776
And they don't pay me
for another week,

28:29.809 --> 28:33.412
So I can give you
half of it in advance

28:33.445 --> 28:36.015
And then the other half
when they pay me.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.049
Is that okay?

28:37.083 --> 28:38.785
Just one week?

28:38.818 --> 28:41.087
Well, then I gotta
pay your dad the rent

28:41.120 --> 28:44.891
And then I gotta get
the groceries.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.393
I didn't have too much
money when we got here.

28:47.426 --> 28:50.529
$207, 'cause Daddy
took the rest.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.298
Zip it, Mel.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.203
$8 is just fine, Mrs...

28:57.236 --> 28:59.171
Martha.
Really?

28:59.205 --> 29:00.973
Oh, thank you,
thank you so much.

29:01.007 --> 29:03.876
I really appreciate that,
thank you.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.311
So what grade
are you in?

29:05.344 --> 29:06.312
A sophomore.

29:06.345 --> 29:07.980
Getting my license
in a month.

29:08.014 --> 29:08.915
Oh.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.783
Can you drive a stick?

29:10.817 --> 29:12.218
I can.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.420
Not quite yet.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.155
My dad taught me.

29:16.188 --> 29:17.356
Well, maybe
you can teach me.

29:17.389 --> 29:18.891
Seriously?

29:18.925 --> 29:20.326
Yeah, out in
the parking lot.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.261
Well, if my dad says
it's okay.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.296
Sure.

29:24.330 --> 29:28.200
Uh, I'll have to take
that under advisement.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.402
Now here's someone
you haven't met.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.004
This is Lilee.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.240
Come on, sweetheart.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.575
This is our Lilee.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.045
She's three
and she's full of it.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.546
Full of what?

29:40.579 --> 29:42.481
It's just an expression,
sweetheart.

29:42.514 --> 29:45.351
I know what
she's full of.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.219
So why don't I get
my dos and don'ts

29:47.253 --> 29:49.288
For this crew together

29:49.321 --> 29:52.224
And you can come back
maybe around 10:30.

29:52.258 --> 29:54.961
Mom says it'll be a good time
for me to do my homework.

29:54.994 --> 29:57.263
Oh, yeah, well,
good luck with that.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.866
It can get a little crazy
around here.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.301
Well, better go,
but see you later.

30:02.334 --> 30:04.270
All right,
thank you so much.

30:08.107 --> 30:09.175
Woo, okay.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.342
She's nice, huh?

30:10.376 --> 30:12.111
She's a lifesaver.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.236
(Lola)
Side of gravy's coming up.

30:37.269 --> 30:39.071
Need more butter.

30:39.105 --> 30:41.507
You want some heart medicine
to go with that cholesterol?

30:41.540 --> 30:43.275
Got plenty on the truck.

30:43.309 --> 30:46.278
You ought to take better
care of yourself, Frank.

30:46.312 --> 30:49.581
I figured maybe I could find
somebody to do it for me.

30:49.615 --> 30:51.483
Got somebody in mind?

30:51.517 --> 30:53.452
Might be.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.321
Someone as pretty as you.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.856
There's always one more
imbecile than you counted on.

30:59.425 --> 31:00.859
(Whispering)
Sorry.

31:02.328 --> 31:03.495
You're late.

31:03.529 --> 31:04.931
I know, I'm sorry.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.399
I had to get
my sitter squared away.

31:08.667 --> 31:11.603
So... here we go.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.906
Mm-hmm.
Here's the deal.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.475
This guy behind me,
that's Les McCallum,

31:16.508 --> 31:19.178
He's a regular and he's having
what he always has,

31:19.211 --> 31:21.613
A third of a pound
of ground round,

31:21.647 --> 31:25.217
French fries,
onions and gravy.

31:25.251 --> 31:26.385
Fries and gravy?

31:26.418 --> 31:27.519
Heart attack special.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.355
Listen, we just give 'em
what they want.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.422
Okay.

31:30.456 --> 31:31.958
The guy over
in the corner,

31:31.991 --> 31:33.592
That's Don Meyer

31:33.625 --> 31:36.495
And you'll be seeing him
a lot around here.

31:36.528 --> 31:39.098
Slow night, huh?
Dead night.

31:39.131 --> 31:41.067
I got this.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.969
Well, it looks like
you've done this before.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.703
A time or two.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.939
How are the kids?
They're managing.

31:46.973 --> 31:47.606
Good.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.408
And Christmas?

31:49.441 --> 31:50.709
I'm working on that.

31:50.742 --> 31:54.213
Well, I put a tip jar out here
on the counter.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.481
Everyone'll see it.

31:55.514 --> 31:56.682
I don't know if they'll do
anything about it,

31:56.715 --> 31:58.384
But they'll see it.
Okay.

31:59.651 --> 32:01.553
Let's see.
All right.

32:03.489 --> 32:04.991
Hi.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.326
Most of the zoo
will be in tonight.

32:07.359 --> 32:10.329
Oh, well, that should be
interesting.

32:10.362 --> 32:13.565
So... tell me
about yourself.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.101
None of my business,

32:15.134 --> 32:17.569
But if you wanted to share,
we've got all night.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.371
Oh, well.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.273
I've been married twice.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.375
First one lasted long enough
for me to have a daughter

32:23.409 --> 32:25.978
And then for my 30th birthday,

32:26.012 --> 32:30.149
I got a new husband
and a year later, a baby.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.484
You don't waste
any time, do you?

32:32.518 --> 32:34.586
I wish I had.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.388
He's the original bad boy

32:36.422 --> 32:38.190
With a truckload
of friends to match.

32:38.224 --> 32:39.591
Handsome?

32:39.625 --> 32:42.628
As sin.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.630
Cowboy Cal Evans.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.067
(Sighing)

32:48.100 --> 32:51.203
Didn't know much about
the sin part then, though.

32:51.237 --> 32:55.207
He could take over a room just
by walking into it, you know?

32:55.241 --> 32:56.475
And then last week,

32:56.508 --> 32:58.710
He took almost everything
that wasn't nailed down

32:58.744 --> 33:00.246
And emptied the bank accounts

33:00.279 --> 33:03.682
And ran off with the local
beauty school graduate.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.152
So when did
things go bad?

33:06.185 --> 33:07.653
(Laughing)

33:07.686 --> 33:09.221
You're funny.

33:09.255 --> 33:10.622
You're so funny.

33:12.558 --> 33:13.792
You have homework?

33:13.825 --> 33:15.227
Did... did it.

33:15.261 --> 33:16.362
You did not.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.130
Mind your own business!

33:18.164 --> 33:19.465
Bed in 20 minutes.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.300
You, go brush
your teeth.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.169
I knew this
would happen.
What?

33:23.202 --> 33:24.403
You figured no rules?

33:24.436 --> 33:25.704
Wrong.

33:25.737 --> 33:28.174
Why are you doing this?

33:28.207 --> 33:31.177
You ain't
making squat.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.444
I like your mom.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.046
She's not my mom.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.215
Well, Carol Ann's not my
biological mom either,

33:36.248 --> 33:37.283
But she loves me.

33:37.316 --> 33:38.517
Lucky you.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.219
What have you got
to complain about?

33:40.252 --> 33:42.088
She's taking care of you,
isn't she?

33:42.121 --> 33:43.355
'Cause she has to.

33:43.389 --> 33:45.091
No, she doesn't.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.659
She could have dumped you off
at the state.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.395
Where's your dad?

33:49.428 --> 33:51.697
He left last week.

33:51.730 --> 33:54.133
Two weeks
before Christmas?

33:54.166 --> 33:55.567
So?

33:55.601 --> 33:58.370
Seems pretty cold to leave
your family at Christmastime.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.239
He'll find me.

34:00.272 --> 34:03.175
Martha didn't leave you,
though, did she?

34:03.209 --> 34:04.410
Might wanna
think about that.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.348
Will you tell us
a Christmas story?

34:09.380 --> 34:11.217
Yeah.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.618
Did you brush
your teeth?
Yes.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.219
Yeah, last Tuesday.

34:14.253 --> 34:15.420
Okay, all right.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.489
You two in bed.

34:17.523 --> 34:19.257
So can I get you
anything else?

34:19.291 --> 34:21.293
Coffee, tea, pie?

34:21.327 --> 34:23.161
The cherries are fresh,
cherry pie?

34:23.195 --> 34:25.431
No, I'm trying to
cut back.

34:25.464 --> 34:27.166
Oh.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.567
It's Martha, right?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.202
Uh, yeah.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.205
Joe Hopkins told you?
Yeah, this afternoon.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.507
He says you're
looking for a rental.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.643
Yes.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.710
Do you have
anything that you think

34:39.745 --> 34:41.713
Someone like me
can afford?

34:41.746 --> 34:43.681
Yeah, I think I might have
one possibility.

34:43.715 --> 34:46.252
I won't know until
I talk to the owner,

34:46.284 --> 34:49.420
So why don't you give me
a call and we'll see.

34:49.455 --> 34:50.688
Thanks, Pastor.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.158
Now, listen,
you and the children

34:52.190 --> 34:53.891
Are more than welcome
to join us at church.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.295
Oh, I don't know.

34:56.328 --> 34:57.429
I don't know if
your church would

34:57.463 --> 34:59.565
Still be standing
if I stepped in.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.233
A real sinner, huh?

35:01.267 --> 35:04.770
Just a slow learner.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.838
Well, listen, we're all
a little slow around here,

35:06.872 --> 35:08.374
So you'll fit right in.

35:10.909 --> 35:14.180
But it was a very special
Christmas tree.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.448
"A magical tree," some said.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.684
The only one
of its kind.

35:18.717 --> 35:21.587
A special tree that bloomed
for the first time

35:21.620 --> 35:23.322
When Mary's
child was born.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.324
That's the kind of tree
we need.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.893
But it wasn't
like any other tree.

35:27.926 --> 35:31.597
This tree only bloomed on
Christmas Day

35:31.630 --> 35:34.466
And the second
Christmas Day was over,

35:34.500 --> 35:37.369
It disappeared for a whole
other year.

35:37.403 --> 35:40.272
It doesn't sound like any
Chr-Chr-Christmas tree

35:40.306 --> 35:41.540
I've ever seen.

35:41.573 --> 35:43.309
That's because
it's in Bethlehem.

35:43.342 --> 35:44.810
They have different
trees there.

35:44.843 --> 35:47.713
A Christmas tree
is a Christmas tree.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.615
I liked your story,
Jeanie.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.183
Thank you, Mel.

35:51.217 --> 35:52.751
Now you little ones
go to sleep.

36:00.259 --> 36:01.860
A-a-another day at school.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.462
Yep.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.297
(Sighing)

36:09.735 --> 36:11.670
Not again!

36:15.274 --> 36:16.342
Go in.

36:22.648 --> 36:23.815
All right.

36:29.321 --> 36:30.289
Hi.
Hi.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.490
Got a minute?

36:31.523 --> 36:32.991
Actually,
I was gonna call you.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.726
Oh, it's no problem,
it was on my way.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.862
Listen, I talked
to Clarice Miller.

36:36.895 --> 36:39.598
She said that she'd consider
renting it out for six months.

36:39.631 --> 36:41.867
Really?

36:41.900 --> 36:43.369
How much?

36:43.402 --> 36:44.903
500.

36:46.505 --> 36:47.773
I can't afford that.

36:47.806 --> 36:48.874
I figured that.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.742
So, if you're interested,

36:50.776 --> 36:53.579
She'll let you clean her house
once a week

36:53.612 --> 36:56.782
And take off 150 a month.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.784
350?

36:58.817 --> 37:00.852
I know it's difficult for you
living by yourself

37:00.886 --> 37:02.821
And having three kids.

37:02.854 --> 37:05.023
No, what's difficult
is living on my own

37:05.056 --> 37:07.359
With three kids
in a motel room.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.663
Tell her I can't pay her
'til after Christmas.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.332
I told her.

37:13.365 --> 37:15.601
She'll hold it for you through
the first week of January.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.035
Oh, you thought of
everything.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.637
I'll let her know.
Thank you.

37:18.670 --> 37:19.805
You're welcome.

37:22.508 --> 37:26.978
* Hark the herald
angels sing *

37:29.014 --> 37:33.519
* Glory to
the newborn king *

37:36.322 --> 37:40.626
* Peace on earth
and mercy mild *

37:42.494 --> 37:46.765
* God and sinners
reconciled *

37:48.567 --> 37:50.402
I want my burgers
medium-well.

37:50.436 --> 37:52.804
I hate soggy burgers.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.673
Okay, how do you
want your eggs?

37:54.706 --> 37:56.041
From a chicken.

37:57.609 --> 37:58.577
Right.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.646
No fish eggs.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.448
How do you want 'em?

38:02.481 --> 38:03.715
On a plate.

38:03.749 --> 38:04.783
Raw?

38:04.816 --> 38:07.986
Over... easy.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.955
Okay.

38:09.988 --> 38:12.724
Uh, toast?
White.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.092
Not whole wheat

38:14.125 --> 38:16.762
Or all that multigrain crap
that I feed the hogs.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.630
How about to drink?

38:18.664 --> 38:19.965
Oh, I don't know.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.033
Coffee, black.

38:22.067 --> 38:24.370
I do my own sugar.

38:24.403 --> 38:25.937
If I had a spoon.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.411
And some ketchup.

38:41.587 --> 38:42.754
Hmm.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.624
(Dog barking)

38:54.966 --> 38:58.069
* Stay, stay

38:58.103 --> 39:00.739
* Stay

39:00.772 --> 39:07.045
* 'Tis the eve
of souls pray *

39:11.917 --> 39:12.718
Hi.

39:12.751 --> 39:13.985
Come in.

39:18.156 --> 39:20.426
So how are you
holding up?

39:20.459 --> 39:22.594
Oh.

39:22.628 --> 39:25.931
On No-Doz and Scotch tape.

39:25.964 --> 39:28.667
Sometimes I get tension
headaches.

39:28.700 --> 39:29.968
Oh.

39:30.001 --> 39:33.405
You should do what it says on
the aspirin bottle.

39:33.439 --> 39:34.940
What's that?

39:34.973 --> 39:35.974
Take two aspirin,

39:36.007 --> 39:37.909
Keep out of
the reach of children.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.745
(Laughing)

39:39.778 --> 39:41.647
Yeah.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.949
You do really need to
get some rest, though.

39:43.982 --> 39:46.117
Yeah, I will.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.554
As soon as I get the kids fed
and then to school.

39:48.587 --> 39:51.122
And... then

39:51.156 --> 39:53.024
The baby's up, so...

39:53.058 --> 39:56.728
Hmm, Lola told me
all about it.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.664
He left you nothing?

39:58.697 --> 40:01.166
Just the kids.

40:01.199 --> 40:03.068
But the girls, you know,
they're doing great.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.703
They're okay.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.072
It's...

40:07.105 --> 40:08.840
Miles is struggling a bit.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.678
His only biological
parent left him.

40:12.711 --> 40:15.113
Oh, he's not yours?

40:15.146 --> 40:16.915
He is now.

40:16.948 --> 40:19.150
Well, there's
only one thing you can do.

40:19.184 --> 40:20.852
What's that?

40:20.886 --> 40:22.020
Love him.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.756
Even when he
doesn't want you to.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.793
Which is most of the time.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.828
Yeah, he has no problem
reminding me

40:29.861 --> 40:32.531
That I am not his mother.

40:32.564 --> 40:35.433
He was really hurt
when his dad left him.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.571
He's better off.

40:39.605 --> 40:42.107
Amen.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.842
Amen.

40:43.875 --> 40:47.212
Now I sound like Mel.

40:47.245 --> 40:50.148
She's our little
believer.

40:50.181 --> 40:53.018
She's absolutely
convinced that...

40:53.051 --> 40:54.753
Jesus is gonna make
everything okay

40:54.786 --> 40:56.655
Because Christmas is here.

40:56.688 --> 40:58.957
Ah, the faith of a child.

41:01.993 --> 41:05.597
I don't really have much
Christmas spirit myself.

41:05.631 --> 41:08.266
Why's that?

41:08.299 --> 41:11.269
My husband
died at Christmas.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.804
Oh.

41:12.838 --> 41:16.007
I'm sorry.

41:16.041 --> 41:19.678
He was
the love of my life.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.913
We were married 43 years

41:21.947 --> 41:24.182
And we hardly
spent a day apart.

41:24.215 --> 41:27.519
He was always underfoot,
you know, like a kid

41:27.553 --> 41:29.054
And then one day,

41:29.087 --> 41:33.124
He just up and dies on me
at Christmas Eve.

41:33.158 --> 41:35.861
I'm sure
he didn't want to.

41:35.894 --> 41:39.064
Well, I mean to ask him
about that...

41:39.097 --> 41:41.667
When I see him up there.

41:44.636 --> 41:46.605
Do you believe in
up there?

41:48.106 --> 41:51.176
I suppose.

41:51.209 --> 41:54.112
I'm still pretty upset
with God

41:54.145 --> 41:55.981
For taking him from me.

41:57.949 --> 42:00.051
Maybe you can tell him
that when you see him.

42:04.790 --> 42:08.059
I should have sold this place
a long time ago,

42:08.093 --> 42:12.297
But it's the only
thing I have left of Sam.

42:12.330 --> 42:14.833
We did really well
for a while.

42:14.866 --> 42:18.336
Sam made
the best root beer.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.038
I wanna show you
something.

42:21.740 --> 42:22.808
Come on.

42:27.913 --> 42:30.281
It's been ten years.

42:30.315 --> 42:32.150
Since you've
been in here?

42:32.183 --> 42:33.284
No.

42:33.318 --> 42:35.921
Since Sam's
last batch of root beer.

42:35.954 --> 42:39.625
I really don't know why
I've kept it all so long.

42:39.658 --> 42:43.294
Maybe you're keeping it to
possibly make another batch.

42:43.328 --> 42:45.897
No, Sam
made the root beer.

42:46.932 --> 42:48.199
Well, with Sam gone,

42:48.233 --> 42:49.835
There just doesn't seem
much of a point,

42:49.868 --> 42:53.104
No matter what
Reverend Meyer says.

42:53.138 --> 42:54.673
Oh, you know what?

42:54.706 --> 42:57.108
He... he said he might have
a place for us to rent.

42:57.142 --> 42:58.644
Where?

42:58.677 --> 43:00.612
Um, the Miller house?

43:00.646 --> 43:03.081
Clarice Miller?

43:03.114 --> 43:05.751
The Brazilian buzz saw?

43:05.784 --> 43:07.986
I haven't met her.

43:08.019 --> 43:10.789
She is like
one of those fish

43:10.822 --> 43:11.957
That live in the Amazon River,

43:11.990 --> 43:13.925
You know, the one
with teeth and they...

43:13.959 --> 43:15.226
Oh, a piranha?

43:15.260 --> 43:17.128
That's her.

43:17.162 --> 43:19.197
All teeth and all mouth

43:19.230 --> 43:20.365
And the only
thing she cares about

43:20.398 --> 43:22.233
Is herself and money.

43:22.267 --> 43:23.935
Oh.

43:23.969 --> 43:25.070
How much?

43:25.103 --> 43:28.006
350, but I have to
clean for it.

43:28.039 --> 43:31.142
Get it in writing.

43:31.176 --> 43:33.011
What are those there?

43:34.880 --> 43:38.650
Oh, well, that's some junk
I was gonna get rid of.

43:38.684 --> 43:39.985
Can I have it?

43:40.018 --> 43:42.854
It's junk.

43:42.888 --> 43:45.290
How about these?

43:45.323 --> 43:47.793
Go ahead.

43:47.826 --> 43:49.360
Thank you.

43:54.900 --> 43:56.334
Hey, how'd it go?

43:56.367 --> 43:57.969
Well, we're getting
used to each other.

43:58.003 --> 43:59.270
Okay, good.

43:59.304 --> 44:02.307
Here, I made a few extra tips
than usual last night

44:02.340 --> 44:04.209
And here you go.

44:04.242 --> 44:05.343
What's this?

44:05.376 --> 44:07.679
My I.O.U.,
signed and dated.

44:07.713 --> 44:09.347
You didn't
need to do that.

44:09.380 --> 44:10.849
I trust you.

44:10.882 --> 44:11.950
Well, it's not
a matter of trust,

44:11.983 --> 44:13.985
It's a matter of
integrity.

44:14.019 --> 44:15.220
I'm just so grateful

44:15.253 --> 44:16.788
That you're helping me out
on your nights off.

44:16.822 --> 44:18.189
Well, it's helping
me too, you know?

44:18.223 --> 44:19.758
I'm getting homework done,

44:19.791 --> 44:21.392
Not spending
as much money as I used to.

44:21.426 --> 44:22.293
Great.

44:22.327 --> 44:23.361
Okay, good.

44:23.394 --> 44:25.063
I just wanted
to let you know,

44:25.096 --> 44:27.198
I didn't know about it until
it was too late.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.135
What?

44:30.168 --> 44:32.037
Well, I fell asleep
around midnight,

44:32.070 --> 44:34.205
And when I woke up this
morning to feed the baby,

44:34.239 --> 44:35.941
It was already there.

44:35.974 --> 44:36.875
But I gotta go!

44:36.908 --> 44:39.244
Bye!

44:39.277 --> 44:41.112
It was there?

44:46.985 --> 44:49.187
(Sighing)

44:49.220 --> 44:51.890
It kinda
grows on you, huh?

44:51.923 --> 44:55.193
I still need
some more colors.

44:55.226 --> 44:57.262
Why, Mel?

44:57.295 --> 44:59.765
Isn't Christmas
without a tree.

44:59.798 --> 45:01.833
But we don't own this room.

45:01.867 --> 45:03.501
We're gonna be here
for Christmas.

45:03.534 --> 45:05.837
Isn't it wonderful?

45:05.871 --> 45:07.205
(Sighing)

45:07.238 --> 45:09.374
You have to erase it.

45:09.407 --> 45:10.976
A permanent marker.

45:13.144 --> 45:15.080
Where did you get
colored markers?

45:15.113 --> 45:16.347
School.

45:16.381 --> 45:17.783
I just borrowed 'em.

45:17.816 --> 45:19.450
You said we can't
afford a real one.

45:19.484 --> 45:22.153
Besides, I think
this is better.

45:22.187 --> 45:23.321
Don't you?

45:23.354 --> 45:25.924
Permanent markers.

45:25.957 --> 45:27.759
Are you gonna
take us to school?

45:29.160 --> 45:30.796
(Sighing)

45:30.829 --> 45:32.497
We're gonna have to
talk about this later, Mel.

45:32.530 --> 45:34.365
You can help,
if you want.

45:36.434 --> 45:37.535
Get in the car.

45:37.568 --> 45:40.005
I... I'm not
going anywhere.

45:40.038 --> 45:42.407
Did you see his lip?

45:42.440 --> 45:44.475
He uses your
makeup to cover it.

45:44.509 --> 45:46.912
Shut up, Mel.

45:46.945 --> 45:49.915
Oh, Miles, we're going to
the principal.

45:49.948 --> 45:51.917
I'm... I'm not ratting.

45:51.950 --> 45:54.219
It's not ratting when
somebody beats you up.

45:54.252 --> 45:56.955
One punch isn't
getting beat up.

45:56.988 --> 45:58.489
Why didn't you tell me?

45:58.523 --> 46:00.491
They called me
a stuttering four-eyes

46:00.525 --> 46:02.260
And that isn't
gonna change.

46:02.293 --> 46:03.795
We'll talk about this
on the way.

46:03.829 --> 46:05.230
Come on.
No.

46:05.263 --> 46:08.399
Miles, get in
the car now!

46:08.433 --> 46:10.501
We-we're not
going anywhere.

46:10.535 --> 46:12.070
Why is that?

46:19.978 --> 46:20.979
Oh, no.

46:21.012 --> 46:22.513
Mama, what is it?

46:22.547 --> 46:25.150
(Groaning)

46:25.183 --> 46:26.885
Oil pan, looks like.

46:26.918 --> 46:28.486
Is that expensive?

46:28.519 --> 46:30.088
Could be
a couple hundred.

46:30.121 --> 46:32.157
Dollars?

46:32.190 --> 46:34.860
I don't have
a couple hundred dollars.

46:34.893 --> 46:36.294
I could have it towed.

46:36.327 --> 46:37.562
Where?

46:37.595 --> 46:39.530
I can't
afford that either.

46:39.564 --> 46:42.133
Well, you can't
leave it here.

46:42.167 --> 46:44.135
There's something else
that we should talk about.

46:44.169 --> 46:45.270
What?

46:45.303 --> 46:46.571
I got a call
from the state today.

46:46.604 --> 46:48.606
There's a construction crew
coming in.

46:48.639 --> 46:51.242
I'm gonna
need all my rooms.

46:51.276 --> 46:52.844
All of them?

46:52.878 --> 46:55.847
Yeah, the state pays full rate
a month in advance.

46:55.881 --> 46:58.383
I can't pass that up.

46:58.416 --> 47:00.218
Sorry.

47:00.251 --> 47:02.888
You're kicking us out
the day after Christmas?

47:02.921 --> 47:04.389
Ehh...

47:04.422 --> 47:06.958
Relocating.

47:06.992 --> 47:08.259
Get the car moved.

47:23.008 --> 47:24.042
(Tires screeching)

47:36.554 --> 47:37.855
(Sighing)

47:53.704 --> 47:54.639
(Bells jingling)

47:54.672 --> 47:55.673
Watch stop?

47:55.706 --> 47:58.276
I'm sorry,
I had car trouble.

47:58.309 --> 47:59.978
Here you go.

48:00.011 --> 48:01.479
Thanks.

48:04.582 --> 48:05.683
Oh.

48:05.716 --> 48:07.452
I know, I'm sorry,
but I gotta pay taxes.

48:07.485 --> 48:09.187
What can you do?

48:09.220 --> 48:10.388
Thank you, I'm grateful.

48:10.421 --> 48:12.223
I do want you to
stay after your shift today

48:12.257 --> 48:13.424
And help Lola.

48:13.458 --> 48:14.993
We're gonna do a deep clean
of the kitchen,

48:15.026 --> 48:16.461
Countertops, everything.

48:16.494 --> 48:17.963
Sure.

48:17.996 --> 48:19.264
But it's overtime.

48:19.297 --> 48:21.132
Oh, great, okay.

48:21.166 --> 48:22.567
(Lola)
Did she tell you?

48:24.102 --> 48:25.103
Yeah.

48:25.136 --> 48:26.171
Ooh, you look a little rough

48:26.204 --> 48:27.705
And we haven't
even started yet.

48:27.738 --> 48:29.007
Car trouble.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.608
Tried to overhaul it
yourself?

48:30.641 --> 48:32.143
I wish.

48:32.177 --> 48:34.445
Ready for
the annual cleanup?

48:34.479 --> 48:35.947
I guess.

48:35.981 --> 48:36.514
Order's up.

48:36.547 --> 48:38.316
Les' hamburger.

48:38.349 --> 48:40.151
He really likes his burger,
doesn't he?

48:40.185 --> 48:41.686
He is a hamburger.

48:41.719 --> 48:43.088
Like meat loaf.

48:43.121 --> 48:44.990
With hair.
Ew.

48:45.023 --> 48:47.558
That's pretty nasty.
Uh-huh.

48:52.730 --> 48:54.932
There you go.

48:58.369 --> 49:00.338
Is it cooked okay?

49:00.371 --> 49:02.607
That's not medium-well.

49:02.640 --> 49:03.708
Well, I can
take it back.

49:03.741 --> 49:05.376
No...

49:07.412 --> 49:10.315
So how you liking it
around here?

49:10.348 --> 49:12.083
Um...

49:12.117 --> 49:13.051
Fine.

49:13.084 --> 49:14.152
Oh.

49:14.185 --> 49:16.087
Is that all?

49:16.121 --> 49:18.023
Well, I haven't had
time to explore.

49:18.056 --> 49:19.557
Kids liking it?

49:19.590 --> 49:22.127
Well, my daughter does,

49:22.160 --> 49:24.762
But my... my boy,
he's having some trouble.

49:24.795 --> 49:26.597
Pushing him around
a little?

49:29.234 --> 49:31.069
Yeah, something like that.

49:31.102 --> 49:33.104
How come?

49:33.138 --> 49:36.507
Well, he's a little small
for his age

49:36.541 --> 49:38.476
And he wears
glasses and...

49:38.509 --> 49:41.012
Stutters, huh?

49:41.046 --> 49:42.780
Yeah, how did you know?

49:42.813 --> 49:45.650
Probably that Park kid.

49:45.683 --> 49:48.186
My grandson had
the same problem.

49:48.219 --> 49:51.289
But I straightened him out.

49:51.322 --> 49:54.325
Bring your boy around
here sometime.

49:54.359 --> 49:55.526
I'll help him.

49:57.328 --> 49:59.630
Well, I don't
want him fighting.

49:59.664 --> 50:02.133
Oh, he won't be.

50:03.434 --> 50:04.635
I think I saw
your car parked up

50:04.669 --> 50:07.805
The interstate turnoff there.

50:07.838 --> 50:10.508
Um, are you
sure it was mine?

50:10.541 --> 50:15.113
Well, there are not too many
old blue caddies around here.

50:15.146 --> 50:17.748
I had some car trouble.

50:17.782 --> 50:19.750
You ought to move it.

50:19.784 --> 50:22.053
I... I can't right now.

50:22.087 --> 50:23.688
I can't afford to.

50:23.721 --> 50:24.789
Ahh.

50:24.822 --> 50:27.625
Well, that's your choice.

50:27.658 --> 50:30.695
Get back to my...
burger.

50:45.643 --> 50:47.412
Hey, guys, that's looking
pretty good.

50:47.445 --> 50:49.380
It's from your story.

50:52.817 --> 50:54.085
No.

50:54.119 --> 50:56.087
This one's better
than my tree.

50:56.121 --> 50:57.622
How do you know?

50:57.655 --> 51:00.158
Because it was my story.

51:00.191 --> 51:01.792
What happened
to your eye?

51:01.826 --> 51:03.528
I ran into something.

51:03.561 --> 51:07.132
Yeah, Danny Park's fist.

51:07.165 --> 51:08.399
Is he bothering you?

51:08.433 --> 51:11.302
No, but I seem
to be bothering him.

51:11.336 --> 51:12.803
You should
tell your mom.

51:12.837 --> 51:14.539
At least someone cares.

51:16.374 --> 51:17.608
What are you drawing?

51:17.642 --> 51:19.210
The couch.

51:26.384 --> 51:28.419
(Bells jingling)

51:28.453 --> 51:30.121
Oh, hi.

51:34.592 --> 51:36.727
What can I get you?

51:36.761 --> 51:38.896
Does Lola have
any of that chili?

51:38.929 --> 51:40.231
I'll see.

51:40.265 --> 51:42.867
(Lola)
Have it up in a jiffy!

51:42.900 --> 51:45.303
She is better than
my dashboard radar.

51:45.336 --> 51:46.804
And louder.

51:48.839 --> 51:50.175
You know, when I was a kid,

51:50.208 --> 51:52.243
The Root Beer was
the place to hang out.

51:52.277 --> 51:53.411
Yeah, Friday, Saturday night,

51:53.444 --> 51:54.679
You couldn't even find
a parking spot.

51:54.712 --> 51:55.580
Really?
Yeah.

51:55.613 --> 51:56.781
Really great carhop stand.

51:56.814 --> 51:59.250
Oh, I always
wanted to do that.

51:59.284 --> 52:01.552
Carhops?
Yeah.

52:01.586 --> 52:03.488
I'm too old now, though.

52:03.521 --> 52:05.490
Not from where
I'm sitting.

52:08.893 --> 52:11.496
It was...
It was a magical place.

52:11.529 --> 52:13.364
Yeah, how so?

52:13.398 --> 52:16.501
Well, if... if you needed
help in something

52:16.534 --> 52:19.504
Or you wanted to meet
that special somebody,

52:19.537 --> 52:21.872
You just came to The Root Beer

52:21.906 --> 52:24.542
And made a wish
and it would come true.

52:24.575 --> 52:25.710
Oh.

52:25.743 --> 52:27.712
Mel would
love that story.

52:27.745 --> 52:30.581
Mel?
My daughter.

52:30.615 --> 52:33.884
Mary Ellen,
short for Mary Ellen.

52:33.918 --> 52:37.688
But she loves stories with
magical stuff in it.

52:39.624 --> 52:42.260
Um, so did you
ever make a wish?

52:42.293 --> 52:44.262
Yeah, yeah, once.

52:44.295 --> 52:46.797
Well, and...

52:46.831 --> 52:49.567
She didn't work out.

52:49.600 --> 52:50.935
Oh.

52:53.438 --> 52:55.340
Well, being
single's not so bad.

52:55.373 --> 52:57.775
I'm not single,
I'm romantically challenged.

52:57.808 --> 52:59.310
That's funny.

52:59.344 --> 53:00.911
(Laughing)

53:00.945 --> 53:02.580
You have a great laugh.

53:02.613 --> 53:04.582
Thank you.

53:04.615 --> 53:07.518
Just my laugh?

53:07.552 --> 53:09.754
The rest isn't bad either.

53:09.787 --> 53:11.956
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean...
No, no, no, no.

53:11.989 --> 53:14.625
I mean, we both have
baggage, right?

53:14.659 --> 53:16.427
Yeah, I guess so.

53:16.461 --> 53:19.430
Here you go,
tall, dark and available.

53:19.464 --> 53:21.399
(Chuckling)

53:21.432 --> 53:22.900
Thank you, Lola.

53:28.306 --> 53:29.740
Oh, are you okay?

53:29.774 --> 53:31.242
It's hot.

53:31.276 --> 53:32.510
Oh, I'm sorry,
have some of that.

53:32.543 --> 53:34.645
Thank you.
I'm so sorry.

53:34.679 --> 53:37.448
It's good, it's...
It's good.

53:39.917 --> 53:42.820
Hey, do you wanna go see
a movie sometime

53:42.853 --> 53:45.356
Or get some dinner?

53:45.390 --> 53:47.692
With you?

53:47.725 --> 53:51.696
Yeah, yeah,
that's the general idea.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.731
I don't... no, that was...
That was dumb.

53:53.764 --> 53:55.566
I don't know
why I was...

53:55.600 --> 53:57.702
Yeah, no, thank you.

53:57.735 --> 53:59.537
Have a good night.

54:02.740 --> 54:04.409
Oh, Martha.

54:04.442 --> 54:05.976
Oh, you are so stupid.

54:07.878 --> 54:09.314
"With you?"

54:09.347 --> 54:11.516
Oh, you're so stupid.

54:11.549 --> 54:12.917
Uh-huh.

54:12.950 --> 54:14.819
I don't need your help.

54:14.852 --> 54:16.587
He's a stud!

54:16.621 --> 54:17.955
I couldn't!

54:17.988 --> 54:19.924
I thought you said he
ran off with a beautician!

54:19.957 --> 54:22.793
He did,
but I'm not divorced.

54:22.827 --> 54:24.462
Uh, no, you're divorced,

54:24.495 --> 54:26.597
You just haven't
gone to court yet.

54:26.631 --> 54:29.867
Which means
I'm still married.

54:29.900 --> 54:31.569
Do you know why most women

54:31.602 --> 54:33.338
Would rather have
beauty than brains?

54:33.371 --> 54:34.739
Why?

54:34.772 --> 54:37.342
Because most men can see
better than they can think.

54:37.375 --> 54:39.910
But Joe Hopkins is
the whole package.

54:39.944 --> 54:42.447
Wall-to-wall handsome,
soft-spoken...

54:42.480 --> 54:46.651
Very important...
Honest to a fault and single!

54:46.684 --> 54:49.053
And you said no.

54:49.086 --> 54:50.755
'Cause I made a vow,
Lola.

54:50.788 --> 54:52.490
So did he.

54:52.523 --> 54:55.493
Well, I'm keeping mine.

54:55.526 --> 54:56.861
Besides, I know
what people think.

54:56.894 --> 54:58.363
Oh, don't worry about
what people think.

54:58.396 --> 54:59.964
They don't do it very often.

55:03.601 --> 55:05.803
Hey, how come
he never got married?

55:05.836 --> 55:08.973
Almost did, she left him
the day before the wedding.

55:09.006 --> 55:11.742
That's awful.

55:11.776 --> 55:14.044
I don't think he's ever
really gotten over it.

55:14.078 --> 55:15.513
I can imagine.

55:15.546 --> 55:18.015
He's never forgiven women
or himself since.

55:18.048 --> 55:21.085
In fact,
you are the first person

55:21.118 --> 55:23.888
I've seen him even take
an interest in.

55:23.921 --> 55:26.391
The destitute
mother of three?

55:26.424 --> 55:27.525
Yeah, go figure.

55:27.558 --> 55:28.626
Hmm.

56:07.832 --> 56:09.133
(Mel)
Mom, we're ready.

56:09.166 --> 56:11.135
Okay, good, I've got
your lunch right here.

56:11.168 --> 56:12.770
That one's for you,
that's for you.

56:12.803 --> 56:15.806
Wait, what is this?

56:15.840 --> 56:17.174
I didn't say nothing.

56:17.207 --> 56:18.809
Don't make a big deal.

56:18.843 --> 56:21.812
Oh, my gosh, how can
I not make a big deal?

56:21.846 --> 56:24.882
I'll handle this.

56:24.915 --> 56:26.651
Please.

56:47.805 --> 56:49.674
I have a possible 10-87.

57:08.192 --> 57:10.728
I'm gonna need a tow
on the corner of State Street

57:10.761 --> 57:12.096
And Mapleton Boulevard.

57:17.067 --> 57:18.869
Hey, Miles.

57:18.903 --> 57:21.138
What are you
doing home so early?

57:21.171 --> 57:23.140
I didn't... I didn't
think it would matter

57:23.173 --> 57:25.876
This close to Christmas.

57:28.679 --> 57:30.881
Whoa, hey,
that's pretty good.

57:30.915 --> 57:32.249
It's not as bad as I thought
it'd be.

57:32.282 --> 57:33.984
Yeah, I know.

57:35.753 --> 57:37.054
You wanna help her?

57:37.087 --> 57:38.989
Finish the tree?

57:39.023 --> 57:40.791
It'll be our surprise.

57:44.128 --> 57:46.564
Needs something
for the flowers.

57:47.865 --> 57:48.799
You know what?

57:48.833 --> 57:50.601
I think I have
the right thing.

57:53.871 --> 57:55.773
How about that?

57:57.542 --> 57:58.909
Cool.

58:03.080 --> 58:04.815
Very cool.

58:04.849 --> 58:06.216
Yeah.

58:06.250 --> 58:08.018
It does feel you...
Make you feel like Christmas,

58:08.052 --> 58:10.187
Doesn't it?
Yeah, it does.

58:10.220 --> 58:13.090
It's beautiful!

58:13.123 --> 58:14.559
You helped?

58:14.592 --> 58:17.862
I did the crib
and the baby stuff.

58:17.895 --> 58:19.129
Really?
Yeah.

58:19.163 --> 58:21.265
Lilee was my model.

58:21.298 --> 58:24.635
This will be the best
Christmas ever.

58:24.669 --> 58:26.070
(Jeanie)
Knock-knock.

58:26.103 --> 58:28.272
Hey, my mom sent me.

58:28.305 --> 58:29.740
Lola's sick and can't
make it in

58:29.774 --> 58:32.810
And Trudy's visiting
her sister in Blanding.

58:32.843 --> 58:34.044
Okay.

58:34.078 --> 58:37.047
Um, well, could you
watch Mel and Lilee?

58:37.081 --> 58:38.048
Miles can help.

58:38.082 --> 58:39.216
I can?

58:39.249 --> 58:41.018
Well, can't you?
Sure.

58:41.051 --> 58:42.820
Yeah, okay, come on.

58:44.188 --> 58:45.923
Look what he did.

58:48.058 --> 58:50.628
Okay.

58:50.661 --> 58:52.096
All right, come with me.

58:58.335 --> 59:00.337
Who started the coffee?

59:00.370 --> 59:02.840
I needed
something to drink.

59:02.873 --> 59:04.041
Oh, thanks, Les.

59:04.074 --> 59:05.943
Listen,
we need a cook.

59:05.976 --> 59:07.845
Do you know anyone?

59:07.878 --> 59:09.246
I might.

59:09.279 --> 59:10.881
As long
as it's hamburgers.

59:10.915 --> 59:12.917
So you like
hamburgers, huh?

59:12.950 --> 59:14.685
You got a problem
with that?

59:14.719 --> 59:16.286
No.

59:16.320 --> 59:17.655
Is this the one?

59:17.688 --> 59:18.789
The one what?

59:18.823 --> 59:20.090
Uh, never mind.

59:20.124 --> 59:23.794
Les, the grill, please?

59:23.828 --> 59:25.195
Thank you.

59:25.229 --> 59:28.065
Okay, give me your coat.

59:28.098 --> 59:30.968
All right, I want you to meet
'em and greet 'em,

59:31.001 --> 59:33.003
Smile and say,
"Thanks for coming."

59:33.037 --> 59:34.271
Okay, where?

59:34.304 --> 59:35.940
Just wherever it's empty.
Okay.

59:35.973 --> 59:37.708
Thanks, buddy.

59:37.742 --> 59:38.976
How're you guys
doing tonight?

59:44.314 --> 59:47.718
(Laughing)

59:47.752 --> 59:49.386
You want me to
come over there and flip your

59:49.419 --> 59:53.658
Flapjacks for you, Frank,
huh, huh?

59:53.691 --> 59:58.729
Les, I got eggs over easy,
chili dog and hash browns.

59:58.763 --> 01:00:01.065
Hamburger,
eggs, hash brown.

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:03.233
No, no, no, I said eggs
and chili dogs.

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:05.002
I don't do chili dogs.

01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:07.037
I do hamburgers.

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:08.839
Just because
you like hamburger

01:00:08.873 --> 01:00:11.008
Doesn't mean everybody
likes it.

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:12.910
They do tonight!

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.344
Don't they?!

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.684
Would you like me to put it
on the specials board?

01:00:19.717 --> 01:00:21.852
Well, if you want.

01:00:21.886 --> 01:00:23.721
People want their food.

01:00:23.754 --> 01:00:25.656
Boy, they can have it good

01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:27.992
Or they can have it fast,
not both!

01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:32.730
His bark's
worse than his bite.

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:34.799
I'll take your
word for it.

01:00:34.832 --> 01:00:36.000
Let's go.

01:00:38.102 --> 01:00:41.205
(Sizzling)

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:54.819
I want a steak.

01:00:54.852 --> 01:00:56.186
Thick and rare.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:59.389
Well, the cook said to tell
you that this was better,

01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:02.126
So I wouldn't complain
if I were you.

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:03.360
But this ain't a steak.

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:05.996
Jim, not so loud,
everyone will hear you.

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.164
I don't care.

01:01:07.197 --> 01:01:09.099
What about steak
don't Lola understand?

01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:11.101
Well, it's not Lola.

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:12.837
Really?
You got a problem?

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:15.840
I ordered a steak.

01:01:15.873 --> 01:01:17.141
Well, that's what you got,
hammerhead.

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.475
That's hamburger steak.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.310
That's the best
grub on the planet.

01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:22.346
It is?
If I say it is!

01:01:26.851 --> 01:01:30.454
I, um...
tried to warn you.

01:01:30.487 --> 01:01:32.723
Not hard enough.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.894
No way.

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:38.262
I ain't eating that.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:41.832
Who don't like
their food?!

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:51.909
What's good?

01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:53.410
Hamburger.

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:55.212
Then I will have the pie.

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:57.982
Well, I really recommend
the ground round.

01:01:58.015 --> 01:02:00.751
Pie is fine.

01:02:00.785 --> 01:02:02.152
I call it
shepherd's pie.

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:06.290
Nice apron.

01:02:06.323 --> 01:02:08.793
Brings out the color
of my eyes, don't you think?

01:02:08.826 --> 01:02:10.494
You don't want to
know what I think.

01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:11.996
Keep it that way.

01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:18.268
What gives?

01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:21.839
Well, Lola's sick
so I had to improvise.

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:23.540
So you brought in
Stalin as the chef.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.142
Nice.

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:26.811
Well, we're selling
a lot of hamburger.

01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:29.346
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

01:02:29.379 --> 01:02:33.951
Um, listen, I want to...

01:02:33.984 --> 01:02:35.485
Apologize
for the other night.

01:02:35.519 --> 01:02:37.387
No, you don't...
You don't need to.

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:39.356
Well, I feel like there's
something I need to explain.

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:43.093
You don't have to
owe me anything.

01:02:43.127 --> 01:02:46.130
Technically,
I'm still married, so...

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:50.134
Oh.

01:02:50.167 --> 01:02:54.238
I thought... I thought
when you said that...

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:56.073
I guess it doesn't...
It doesn't really matter

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:59.276
What I thought, does it?

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:01.445
No, it does, just...

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:03.180
There's something
you don't understand.

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:05.115
You don't need to
explain anything.

01:03:05.149 --> 01:03:06.550
I promise.

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:18.162
Any more orders?

01:03:18.195 --> 01:03:20.130
I'll ask Martha.

01:03:20.164 --> 01:03:21.832
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:21.866 --> 01:03:23.167
You call your
mom Martha?

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.468
She's not my mom!

01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:26.470
She looks after you,
don't she?

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:28.005
Yeah.

01:03:28.038 --> 01:03:29.473
Well, then she's your mom,
treat her accordingly.

01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:32.209
Why do you care?
I don't.

01:03:32.242 --> 01:03:34.278
At least about
a spoiled kid like you.

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:36.280
I'm not spoiled.
Oh, yes, you are.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:38.282
That's why those
punks pick on you.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.617
You-you don't know
not-nothing about me!

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:43.320
I know that you have
a hard time talking

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:44.889
And you wear glasses

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:46.190
So you think
you have a tough time.

01:03:46.223 --> 01:03:47.424
Well, you don't.

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:48.926
How do you know?

01:03:48.959 --> 01:03:50.194
'Cause I was
your age once.

01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:54.231
Yeah, wh-when there
were dinosaurs.

01:03:54.264 --> 01:03:57.001
You wanna know
a simple way to stop 'em?

01:03:59.236 --> 01:04:01.171
I'll take that
as a yes.

01:04:01.205 --> 01:04:02.940
Come here.

01:04:05.242 --> 01:04:07.411
Now, I once knew a man,

01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:09.980
Little fella,
worked in a bank,

01:04:10.014 --> 01:04:11.548
And he got into some
kind of trouble

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.617
And they sent him to jail.

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:14.919
Well, the minute
he got there,

01:04:14.952 --> 01:04:16.520
It was just awful,

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:19.489
'Cause the worst bully
in the joint

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:21.525
Harassed this guy

01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:24.962
And he stole his food,
he opened his mail.

01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:26.997
He never gave
that little guy a break.

01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:28.598
What did he do?

01:04:28.632 --> 01:04:30.434
He went crazy.

01:04:30.467 --> 01:04:32.069
What do you mean?

01:04:32.102 --> 01:04:35.539
Well, that little
fella got one of the guards

01:04:35.572 --> 01:04:39.109
To warn the bully and his
buddies all about him.

01:04:39.143 --> 01:04:43.313
He said that little banker
was a... a psycho.

01:04:43.347 --> 01:04:46.183
He said he... he did
terrible things to people.

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:48.252
That's why he was in jail.

01:04:48.285 --> 01:04:49.386
He said that
little banker's

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:52.022
The most dangerous man
he ever saw.

01:04:52.056 --> 01:04:54.458
He said if anybody
pushes him over the edge,

01:04:54.491 --> 01:04:56.160
He's gonna pay for it
big time.

01:04:58.428 --> 01:05:01.531
It was...
It was just a story?

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:03.067
Yep.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:06.636
Because, most of the time,
what people seem like

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:09.673
Is a lot more important
than what they are like.

01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:11.308
You understand?

01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:12.576
Maybe.

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:14.945
That little man put
a piece of Alka-Seltzer

01:05:14.979 --> 01:05:16.146
Under his tongue,

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:20.084
Foamed up like
he was foaming like a dog.

01:05:20.117 --> 01:05:21.952
And if a bully thinks that

01:05:21.986 --> 01:05:23.520
He's got a real
fight on his hands,

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:27.557
Well, he's not gonna want it
to continue.

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:29.960
No, the biggest troublemaker

01:05:29.994 --> 01:05:32.396
You're ever gonna have to deal
with in life

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:38.068
Is watching you from
that mirror every morning.

01:05:38.102 --> 01:05:40.237
Do you understand?

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.505
Yeah.

01:05:41.538 --> 01:05:42.672
Good boy.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:59.589
Hey, Miles?

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.091
You need to get some sleep.

01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:03.327
We're not gonna have
any more customers tonight.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.229
Okay.

01:06:14.271 --> 01:06:15.672
What's all this for?

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.374
It's for
making root beer.

01:06:20.677 --> 01:06:23.080
What's th-this for?

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:25.182
Looks like a recipe.

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:28.652
Maybe w-we could
try it sometime.

01:06:28.685 --> 01:06:30.720
Listen,
you need to get to bed.

01:06:30.754 --> 01:06:32.422
You can sleep on the couch,
okay?
Okay.

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:34.791
And I want to say thank you,
you were great today.

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.260
Sure.

01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:39.196
All right.

01:06:47.171 --> 01:06:48.672
Any more?

01:06:48.705 --> 01:06:50.240
Oh, I think we're done.

01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:54.744
What's that boy of yours
want for Christmas?

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:56.780
He hasn't said much.

01:06:56.813 --> 01:06:59.449
I didn't ask that.

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:02.819
I don't know, he probably
wants some homemade root beer.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:05.021
He's a man
after my own heart.

01:07:08.092 --> 01:07:09.793
Oh, Les, I...
I couldn't, no.

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:11.061
Is your arm broke?

01:07:11.095 --> 01:07:12.796
Those kids
deserve a Christmas.

01:07:15.432 --> 01:07:16.333
Les, I can't.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:17.801
No, no.

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:21.305
You are the most arduous woman
I've ever met in my life.

01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:22.739
Les, really...

01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:30.314
Thank you.

01:07:30.347 --> 01:07:31.748
Now go home.

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:34.118
Go on,
I'll clean up.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:39.556
Oh, Trudy has a little
get-together Christmas Eve.

01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:41.258
Shuts down early.

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:43.059
Bring the kids.

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:46.230
Thanks, I will.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:53.503
Oh, thanks.

01:07:57.507 --> 01:07:59.243
We did good.

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:02.279
(Chuckling)

01:08:04.448 --> 01:08:06.783
(Bells jingling)

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:19.363
(Joe)
Hey.

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:21.231
Thought you
might want a ride.

01:08:21.265 --> 01:08:22.799
You were waiting for us?

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:30.207
I had to
impound your car.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.741
Oh.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.778
Why didn't you tell me?

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.880
Would it have made
a difference?

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:39.483
I might have been able to
save you a $200 impound fee.

01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:44.321
Thanks for towing me.

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:46.856
You want a ride?

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:49.193
No, walking's
good for the soul.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:52.696
Ri-riding's good, too.

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:54.130
Hop in.

01:09:14.518 --> 01:09:15.952
Just need to
fill in behind it.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:17.754
With what?

01:09:17.787 --> 01:09:19.689
You know,
Christmas stuff.

01:09:19.723 --> 01:09:21.225
We're gonna be late.

01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:22.326
Oh, hey,
it's a half-day.

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:23.527
I told you you could
miss if you wanted.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.529
I changed my mind.
Oh.

01:09:25.562 --> 01:09:26.895
We can finish it tonight.

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:28.698
Okay.

01:09:28.732 --> 01:09:30.567
Well, bye.
Bye.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.935
Love you, bye.
Bye.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:40.510
Miss Lilee, what are we
gonna do today?

01:09:52.589 --> 01:09:54.424
D-did you pick up
what I told you?

01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:56.560
Sure did.
Okay.

01:09:56.593 --> 01:09:58.362
Let's do this.
Okay.

01:10:04.568 --> 01:10:06.370
(Knocking)

01:10:06.403 --> 01:10:08.938
Hi, I wasn't
expecting you.

01:10:08.972 --> 01:10:11.408
Need to talk to you.

01:10:11.441 --> 01:10:13.310
She wants
more money for the house.

01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:16.646
No, but she has decided she
doesn't want to rent it now,

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.583
But I'll keep looking.

01:10:19.616 --> 01:10:22.552
It's probably just
a waste of your time.

01:10:22.586 --> 01:10:25.789
No, helping folks
is never a waste of time.

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:33.797
Danny, you'd better not
bother him today.

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.599
Is wimp boy afraid?

01:10:35.632 --> 01:10:37.301
No, psycho.

01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:38.602
Huh?

01:10:38.635 --> 01:10:40.604
I tried to talk to him
but he wouldn't listen.

01:10:40.637 --> 01:10:43.473
I'll make him listen.
No, you don't understand.

01:10:43.507 --> 01:10:45.575
He's dangerous.

01:10:45.609 --> 01:10:47.010
Real dangerous.

01:10:47.043 --> 01:10:50.447
I'm afraid he'll
hurt someone... again.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.581
Again?

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:53.583
Last time this happened,
we had to move.

01:10:53.617 --> 01:10:54.951
Do you think
we like it here?

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:57.687
We have to be here.

01:10:57.721 --> 01:10:59.823
What... what
do you mean?

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:15.939
Too late.

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:17.441
I tried to warn you.

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:27.751
(Growling)

01:11:35.559 --> 01:11:37.694
(Growling)

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:48.672
Yes!

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:54.010
Holy crap!

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:55.612
I can't believe
that worked!

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:57.581
God helped
you do that, you know.

01:11:57.614 --> 01:11:58.848
Where has he been before?

01:11:58.882 --> 01:12:01.117
Probably waiting for you
to make the first move.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.119
Now come on.

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.721
Oh.

01:12:04.754 --> 01:12:05.822
(Knocking)

01:12:07.724 --> 01:12:09.058
Mr. Bullington.

01:12:09.092 --> 01:12:10.960
May I come in?

01:12:10.994 --> 01:12:13.497
I'll come out,
the baby's sleeping.

01:12:14.964 --> 01:12:16.833
Something's come up.

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:19.736
The state workers,
they're coming in tomorrow

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:23.106
And I need your room.

01:12:23.139 --> 01:12:25.542
It's Christmas Eve.

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:27.811
I already took an advance.

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:29.946
Where are we gonna go?

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:32.148
You might try over
at the Sleepy Inn,

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:33.617
Over at the Mayfield.

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:35.952
I don't have a car.

01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:37.754
I got no choice.

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:39.656
I'm sorry.

01:12:53.737 --> 01:12:55.905
Is that what
you want, Joe?

01:12:55.939 --> 01:12:57.641
What you really want?

01:12:59.776 --> 01:13:01.711
I think it's what
you should want, too.

01:13:04.748 --> 01:13:06.850
Let's go to my place.

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:12.822
I still have a few things we
need to consider, okay?

01:13:12.856 --> 01:13:14.424
Yeah.

01:13:14.458 --> 01:13:15.759
Yeah, okay.

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:35.445
It is beautiful.

01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:41.451
This is gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

01:13:41.485 --> 01:13:44.554
Actually, this is
our last night here.

01:13:44.588 --> 01:13:45.489
(Miles)
What?

01:13:45.522 --> 01:13:47.691
Where are we
going to go?

01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:49.493
I haven't figured
that out yet.

01:13:49.526 --> 01:13:50.960
I was hoping that
we could get that house

01:13:50.994 --> 01:13:54.097
That Mr. Meyer
told us about.

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:56.666
But we can't?

01:13:58.602 --> 01:14:00.103
It's okay.

01:14:04.207 --> 01:14:07.143
I don't even have Christmas
presents for you guys.

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:09.012
What about these?

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:11.014
That's not much.

01:14:11.047 --> 01:14:13.483
We weren't
expecting anything.

01:14:13.517 --> 01:14:15.685
Oh, honey,
that's so sweet.

01:14:20.824 --> 01:14:23.660
We're gonna have to
paint over the tree.

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:25.128
Why?

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:28.231
Because it wouldn't be right
to leave it here like this.

01:14:28.264 --> 01:14:32.869
But h-he's the one
making us get out.

01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:35.605
Whether Mr. Bullington is right
or wrong, it doesn't matter.

01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:37.907
It's what we do,
that's what's important.

01:14:40.677 --> 01:14:43.079
Mel... it's your tree.

01:14:45.849 --> 01:14:48.117
We'll paint over it
when you get home.

01:14:53.089 --> 01:14:54.691
The cafe closes
early tonight.

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:55.859
Do you guys
wanna come with me?

01:14:55.892 --> 01:14:57.561
Yeah!
Yeah.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.602
(Bells jingling)

01:15:10.907 --> 01:15:13.109
Okay guys,
come sit over here.

01:15:15.144 --> 01:15:17.947
Santa Claus.
Yeah.

01:15:17.981 --> 01:15:19.248
Here, Lilee.

01:15:19.282 --> 01:15:21.017
I got you some
coloring.

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:22.752
Thank you.
Here you go.

01:15:22.786 --> 01:15:24.621
Pink.

01:15:26.690 --> 01:15:29.258
You okay?
I'm fine.

01:15:29.292 --> 01:15:31.060
You don't look fine.

01:15:31.094 --> 01:15:33.630
I'm just trying to
iron out some of the bugs.

01:15:33.663 --> 01:15:35.565
Ah... got it.

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:39.769
Mmm, I love this place.

01:15:39.803 --> 01:15:41.805
Yeah, it does kind of
grow on you, doesn't it?

01:15:41.838 --> 01:15:43.072
I'm saving up
to buy it.

01:15:43.106 --> 01:15:44.240
Seriously?

01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:45.809
I'm still
a couple of grand short.

01:15:45.842 --> 01:15:47.844
Oh, well,
you'll find it.
I doubt that.

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:50.580
I can't find my head
with both hands.

01:15:50.614 --> 01:15:51.915
You have family here?

01:15:51.948 --> 01:15:54.117
Not here, mm-mm.

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:55.885
So you're spending
Christmas alone?

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:58.254
Not alone.

01:15:58.287 --> 01:15:59.856
What does that mean?

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:02.826
Well, that just means that
her and Frank are an item.

01:16:02.859 --> 01:16:04.060
Rasmuss...

01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:07.063
Rasmussen, and, yes,
he has hidden qualities.

01:16:07.096 --> 01:16:09.766
Oh, he has very
hidden qualities.

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:12.101
(Laughing)

01:16:12.135 --> 01:16:13.703
How are you?

01:16:13.737 --> 01:16:15.004
Um, I'm fine.

01:16:15.038 --> 01:16:16.740
There's something
she's not telling us.

01:16:16.773 --> 01:16:18.341
What?

01:16:18.374 --> 01:16:20.710
Nothing, it's just
that Miller lady,

01:16:20.744 --> 01:16:22.679
She's not gonna
rent us the house.

01:16:22.712 --> 01:16:24.814
Why am I not
surprised?

01:16:24.848 --> 01:16:27.050
You're not?
She was here.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:28.384
She was?
Yeah.

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.386
And she was
with somebody.
Who?

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:31.387
Joe.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.222
Ugh!

01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:35.959
That poor boy can't think for
himself when she's around.

01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:37.126
Joe knows her?

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.062
Oh, she's
a horse's patoot.

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:41.397
They were engaged and she
broke it off.

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.366
She's the one that
left him at the altar?

01:16:43.399 --> 01:16:46.269
Every silicone square inch.

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:48.738
And now they're...
Looks like it.

01:16:48.772 --> 01:16:50.874
Oh.

01:16:50.907 --> 01:16:52.308
Well, maybe
they'll work it out.

01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:53.910
I doubt that.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:56.145
He's normal and she's
a South American Looney Tune.

01:16:56.179 --> 01:16:57.981
(Laughing)

01:16:59.148 --> 01:17:01.985
Well, I do have to say,

01:17:02.018 --> 01:17:04.020
This has been more like
old times around here

01:17:04.053 --> 01:17:06.956
Than in a very long time.

01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:09.058
I think you have a lot to
do with that, Martha.

01:17:09.092 --> 01:17:10.093
Me?

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:11.695
Oh, I don't think so.

01:17:11.728 --> 01:17:14.030
No, she's right,
you have made a difference.

01:17:14.063 --> 01:17:15.431
I've been here,
what, ten days?

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:18.234
Well, sometimes
that's all it takes.

01:17:18.267 --> 01:17:22.772
Well, ladies,
these are bonus checks.

01:17:22.806 --> 01:17:25.909
It's not much, but it's
all I could afford.

01:17:32.782 --> 01:17:34.217
I don't know
how to tell you this,

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:36.252
But I can't make a go
of this place.

01:17:36.285 --> 01:17:37.987
I'm gonna close it down.

01:17:56.973 --> 01:17:58.341
(Coughing)

01:17:58.374 --> 01:17:59.909
Um, Mama?

01:18:02.812 --> 01:18:05.248
Hi.

01:18:05.281 --> 01:18:06.482
What's going on?

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:10.286
Well, it isn't much,
but everybody pitched in.

01:18:10.319 --> 01:18:12.121
Merry Christmas.

01:18:12.155 --> 01:18:14.090
Thank you.

01:18:14.123 --> 01:18:15.458
Merry Christmas!

01:18:17.994 --> 01:18:19.228
I...

01:18:19.262 --> 01:18:20.329
I don't know
what to say.

01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:21.731
Well, don't say nothing.

01:18:21.765 --> 01:18:23.466
I brought
the boy something.

01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:27.837
Thought you might like these,
just like Sam used to make.

01:18:27.871 --> 01:18:30.439
You made it for me?

01:18:30.473 --> 01:18:31.775
Mmm...

01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:32.842
(Martha)
Say thank you!

01:18:32.876 --> 01:18:34.310
He... he...
The boy can talk.

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:36.045
Thanks.

01:18:36.079 --> 01:18:37.981
I'll teach you
how to make it.
Yeah!

01:18:38.014 --> 01:18:39.215
Thank you, Les.

01:18:39.248 --> 01:18:40.283
Thank you, thank you!

01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:42.451
Cut that out,
cut that out.

01:18:42.485 --> 01:18:45.254
Don't get sloppy on me.

01:18:45.288 --> 01:18:46.990
(Woman)
Merry Christmas, Martha.

01:18:47.023 --> 01:18:48.324
We love you.

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.362
Sounds like old times,
doesn't it, Sam?

01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:59.936
Merry Christmas, darling.

01:18:59.969 --> 01:19:01.237
Merry Christmas.

01:19:02.972 --> 01:19:04.941
And remember,
everybody is welcome

01:19:04.974 --> 01:19:07.944
At the church annual Christmas
breakfast in the morning.

01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:10.046
We are so glad that
you came to this town!

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:11.447
(Bells jingling)

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:16.385
This is incredible.

01:19:16.419 --> 01:19:18.454
(Man)
Well!

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:20.489
Well now,
isn't this nice?

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:27.330
What you think, Bob?

01:19:27.363 --> 01:19:29.532
Yeah, real nice.

01:19:29.565 --> 01:19:30.800
Yeah.

01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:33.402
Stand back.

01:19:35.939 --> 01:19:38.141
What are you doing here?

01:19:38.174 --> 01:19:41.210
Well now, I didn't want to
miss the little gathering,

01:19:41.244 --> 01:19:42.145
Or my boy.

01:19:42.178 --> 01:19:43.512
Right there, Miles?

01:19:43.546 --> 01:19:47.383
I told everybody...
you would come back.

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:52.121
You, you are a hard one
to track down, baby.

01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:54.557
Still look good,
though.

01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:56.225
You're not.

01:19:56.259 --> 01:19:57.961
Why don't you slip into
something more comfortable,

01:19:57.994 --> 01:19:59.162
Like unconsciousness?

01:19:59.195 --> 01:20:04.267
Hey now, baby,
no reason to get angry.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:07.837
I was expecting you to still
be at our place.

01:20:07.871 --> 01:20:10.206
How come you left, huh?

01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:13.009
I'm not the one who left.

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:14.377
Well, it don't matter none,

01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:16.079
'Cause I just came here to
get you some stuff.

01:20:16.112 --> 01:20:18.047
Bob.

01:20:18.081 --> 01:20:19.482
Here you go.

01:20:27.924 --> 01:20:30.526
Is that all?

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:33.329
Then you'll go?

01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:34.563
Yeah.

01:20:34.597 --> 01:20:35.899
Yeah, all of us.

01:20:35.932 --> 01:20:37.633
Here you go.

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:39.068
How did you...

01:20:39.102 --> 01:20:40.569
I stopped by
the hotel, buddy.

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:41.971
Picked up your stuff.

01:20:42.005 --> 01:20:44.240
You broke in?

01:20:44.273 --> 01:20:47.476
Well, the door
was open, sort of.

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:50.413
Hotel manager's right
obliging, though.

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:53.549
Ten bucks
didn't hurt, neither.

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:55.384
Let's go, buddy,
come on.

01:20:55.418 --> 01:20:57.921
Don't go, Miles.

01:20:57.954 --> 01:20:58.922
I'm sorry.

01:20:58.955 --> 01:21:01.590
But we're a family!

01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:06.429
Cal, don't do this.

01:21:06.462 --> 01:21:09.498
He needs
a stable home.

01:21:09.532 --> 01:21:12.401
What are you saying,
I ain't a good daddy?

01:21:12.435 --> 01:21:14.103
I'm still your daddy,
right, buddy?

01:21:14.137 --> 01:21:17.606
I... I told everybody that
you... you would come back.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.542
Let me do
the talking, buddy.

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:21.210
Let's go.

01:21:23.146 --> 01:21:25.314
Send it to the address
on the paper.

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:27.450
Let's go, Bob.

01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:28.985
(Bob)
Merry Christmas.

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:34.623
I'm so sorry.

01:21:34.657 --> 01:21:36.993
Is there anything
I can do?

01:21:37.026 --> 01:21:37.961
Don't worry, honey.

01:21:37.994 --> 01:21:39.528
I'll... I'll
take the girls.

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:41.330
Come here, sweetie.

01:21:41.364 --> 01:21:44.000
Come on, Aunt Carol's gonna
take you for a walk.

01:21:44.033 --> 01:21:45.134
(Martha)
Thank you.

01:21:45.168 --> 01:21:47.036
Come on, come on.

01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:49.105
What about you, Mama?

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.342
Just go with them,
okay?

01:21:58.181 --> 01:21:59.348
I need to be alone.

01:21:59.382 --> 01:22:01.517
Bye, Mama.

01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:03.186
Come on, honey.

01:22:16.365 --> 01:22:17.967
(Martha)
You really need
to be more cautious

01:22:18.001 --> 01:22:19.068
With your little sister.

01:22:19.102 --> 01:22:20.469
She's not my sister!

01:22:20.503 --> 01:22:22.205
Half-sister, then.

01:22:22.238 --> 01:22:25.074
If we would have stayed home
and w-w-waited...

01:22:25.108 --> 01:22:27.376
And waited for Dad,
this would not have happened!

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:32.248
Why didn't you tell me?

01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:33.749
Don't make a big deal.

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:36.685
Oh, my gosh, how could
I not make a big deal?

01:22:36.719 --> 01:22:40.056
I'll handle this.

01:22:40.089 --> 01:22:41.357
Please.

01:22:44.193 --> 01:22:46.029
(Miles)
She's not my mom.

01:22:46.062 --> 01:22:47.296
She is now.

01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:50.033
No, she just married my dad,
that's all.

01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:55.304
You wanna help her?

01:22:55.338 --> 01:22:57.340
Finish the tree?

01:22:57.373 --> 01:22:59.075
It'll be our surprise.

01:22:59.108 --> 01:23:00.376
We did good.

01:23:06.382 --> 01:23:08.451
(Mel)
No, he doesn't
work like that.

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:10.386
God kinda makes you
worry a while

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:12.355
Until you get something,

01:23:12.388 --> 01:23:15.791
Then later, you believe
in Him.

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:18.261
Only you gotta pray, though.

01:23:18.294 --> 01:23:20.629
(Martha)
I don't think I'm very good
at that, either.

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:22.298
That's the easy part.

01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:23.632
You don't have to be.

01:23:23.666 --> 01:23:25.268
You just
have to do it.

01:23:30.073 --> 01:23:32.641
(Crying)

01:23:40.483 --> 01:23:42.251
God...

01:23:46.455 --> 01:23:48.624
I know I haven't
prayed before.

01:23:54.463 --> 01:23:57.266
There isn't
anything else I can do.

01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:59.535
I've done everything I can.

01:23:59.568 --> 01:24:03.339
I can't lose Miles
and I'm out of options.

01:24:18.521 --> 01:24:23.426
I never asked
for any handouts...

01:24:23.459 --> 01:24:26.095
And I never broke down.

01:24:29.332 --> 01:24:32.835
I did everything
that I thought was right.

01:24:38.341 --> 01:24:40.176
I don't care about me.

01:24:42.178 --> 01:24:43.546
I care about Miles.

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:45.381
I love him so much.

01:24:47.616 --> 01:24:49.552
And he doesn't
deserve any of this.

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:52.155
None of this is his fault.

01:24:52.188 --> 01:24:54.123
I...

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:02.131
If you're gonna punish
somebody, punish me.

01:25:10.806 --> 01:25:14.810
Just... please
don't let him go with Cal.

01:25:19.515 --> 01:25:21.384
I'm begging you.

01:25:21.417 --> 01:25:24.220
God, if you're up there,
please...

01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:30.125
Please help me.

01:25:47.210 --> 01:25:50.713
* Mary's child

01:25:50.746 --> 01:25:54.483
* To us he
has been sent *

01:25:56.352 --> 01:25:59.555
* Mary's child

01:25:59.588 --> 01:26:04.827
* His heart and soul
are spent *

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:08.797
* Child of glory

01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:13.269
* Around
Him angels sing *

01:26:14.803 --> 01:26:17.840
* Mary's child

01:26:17.873 --> 01:26:21.910
* God's greatest
gift he brings *

01:26:24.447 --> 01:26:27.416
* Mary's child

01:26:27.450 --> 01:26:32.655
* God's greatest gift

01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:36.325
* He brings

01:26:55.678 --> 01:26:59.782
The... the door
was locked.

01:26:59.815 --> 01:27:02.318
Did you forget
something?

01:27:02.351 --> 01:27:03.252
Yeah.

01:27:03.286 --> 01:27:05.688
Okay, um...

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:06.555
What is it?

01:27:06.589 --> 01:27:08.591
I'll get it for you.
You.

01:27:13.896 --> 01:27:15.631
What?

01:27:18.601 --> 01:27:21.470
We were h-heading back
and...

01:27:23.472 --> 01:27:26.642
And he
told me not to do that.

01:27:26.675 --> 01:27:28.544
Do what?

01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:30.446
This.

01:27:33.382 --> 01:27:38.387
H-he called me
a stuttering f-four-eyes.

01:27:38.421 --> 01:27:40.656
Oh, Miles.

01:27:40.689 --> 01:27:45.027
He said I always could be
one if I didn't quit.

01:27:46.862 --> 01:27:49.365
Miles, I am so sorry.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.037
And then
I f-figured it out.

01:27:56.839 --> 01:28:00.743
He was the one that made me
feel like nothing.

01:28:00.776 --> 01:28:03.379
He called me
that... always has.

01:28:05.414 --> 01:28:09.652
And then... and then I
remembered something you said.

01:28:09.685 --> 01:28:11.554
What's that?

01:28:11.587 --> 01:28:13.356
To stand up for myself

01:28:13.389 --> 01:28:17.560
And be proud
of who I am

01:28:17.593 --> 01:28:21.397
And others would be.

01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:26.435
I told him t-t-to t-t-take me
back to th-the cafe.

01:28:27.436 --> 01:28:30.539
But you weren't there.

01:28:30.573 --> 01:28:32.741
How did you get here?

01:28:32.775 --> 01:28:34.443
He brought me.

01:28:34.477 --> 01:28:35.644
Cal?

01:28:35.678 --> 01:28:37.312
No, him.

01:28:48.424 --> 01:28:50.993
Thank you.

01:28:51.026 --> 01:28:53.562
I wanted to
show you something.

01:28:53.596 --> 01:28:57.433
I came by the cafe,
I found Miles instead.

01:28:57.466 --> 01:28:58.634
He filled me in.

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:01.404
Sort of.

01:29:02.538 --> 01:29:05.107
What is it?

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:07.743
Why don't
you come see?

01:29:07.776 --> 01:29:08.777
We should hurry, though.

01:29:08.811 --> 01:29:10.679
It's supposed to snow.

01:29:48.150 --> 01:29:50.185
That.

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:52.120
What's all this?

01:29:52.154 --> 01:29:53.589
It's for you.

01:29:53.622 --> 01:29:54.857
Come on.

01:30:02.197 --> 01:30:03.766
Hi!

01:30:04.933 --> 01:30:06.969
Hi!
Hi!

01:30:10.105 --> 01:30:11.807
Everybody pitched in.

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.008
Pitched in?

01:30:13.041 --> 01:30:14.743
Yeah, this is
Clarice Miller's house.

01:30:14.777 --> 01:30:18.914
Joe talked her into
renting it to you.

01:30:18.947 --> 01:30:21.717
The Pastor and the congregation
did most of it.

01:30:23.051 --> 01:30:24.219
That ain't all!

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:26.054
Frank...

01:30:26.088 --> 01:30:28.156
It wasn't as bad
as it first looked.

01:30:28.190 --> 01:30:30.826
What wasn't?

01:30:32.895 --> 01:30:33.962
Jack?

01:30:33.996 --> 01:30:35.664
It's all fixed.

01:30:35.698 --> 01:30:39.034
And Leroy, over to the garage,
he found out another thing.

01:30:39.067 --> 01:30:42.838
What, that Jack's
a worthless piece of junk?

01:30:42.871 --> 01:30:45.040
Nope.

01:30:45.073 --> 01:30:48.577
It's a special model,
only 600 of 'em ever made.

01:30:48.611 --> 01:30:52.014
Car's worth maybe 5,000.

01:30:52.047 --> 01:30:54.983
$5,000?

01:30:55.017 --> 01:30:57.686
Jack's worth $5,000?

01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.556
Oh, my gosh!

01:31:00.589 --> 01:31:01.957
There's one other thing.

01:31:05.027 --> 01:31:06.562
It looks like
The Root Beer Drive-In

01:31:06.595 --> 01:31:07.963
Is gonna open again.

01:31:07.996 --> 01:31:09.231
Who's doing that?

01:31:09.264 --> 01:31:10.866
Me and Frank are buying it,

01:31:10.899 --> 01:31:12.568
But we're really
gonna need some help.

01:31:12.601 --> 01:31:14.069
Are you interested?

01:31:14.102 --> 01:31:16.204
Are you kidding me?

01:31:16.238 --> 01:31:18.273
(Carol)
And something else.

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.275
Go on, tell her.

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:23.211
Sorry about earlier,
you know, kicking you out

01:31:23.245 --> 01:31:26.081
And that mix-up
with that fella

01:31:26.114 --> 01:31:28.784
That said
he was your husband.

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:30.218
And the rest of it.

01:31:30.252 --> 01:31:35.090
Well, I was talking to
the foreman from the state

01:31:35.123 --> 01:31:38.827
And I told 'em what you
were up against.

01:31:38.861 --> 01:31:40.663
And all of 'em donated!

01:31:40.696 --> 01:31:43.532
Your first month's rent,
all taken care of.

01:31:43.566 --> 01:31:45.033
Yeah.

01:31:45.067 --> 01:31:46.969
And?

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:48.671
You're very sorry.

01:31:48.704 --> 01:31:51.640
Aren't you, Owen?

01:31:51.674 --> 01:31:53.742
You don't know
how sorry I am.

01:31:57.112 --> 01:31:59.181
I thought
God abandoned me.

01:31:59.214 --> 01:32:02.084
No, He sends His angels,

01:32:02.117 --> 01:32:04.219
But they don't always
come from the sky,

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:05.854
Some are already here.

01:32:05.888 --> 01:32:07.289
Yes, like the one
who came up with this

01:32:07.322 --> 01:32:09.725
Whole idea in the
first place.

01:32:09.758 --> 01:32:12.160
You did all this?

01:32:12.194 --> 01:32:14.563
Not just me.

01:32:14.597 --> 01:32:16.298
No, it was all of us.

01:32:16.331 --> 01:32:18.300
And all of us...

01:32:18.333 --> 01:32:20.803
We're very happy you're
here with us in Mapleton.

01:32:22.137 --> 01:32:24.206
We love you, Mama.

01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:26.008
Oh, I love you, too.

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:30.278
I-I-I love you,
too, Mom.

01:32:30.312 --> 01:32:32.214
Oh...

01:32:32.247 --> 01:32:33.849
I love you, too.

01:32:33.882 --> 01:32:36.685
That's what I call
a merry Christmas.

01:32:36.719 --> 01:32:37.986
No.

01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:39.755
A root beer Christmas.

01:32:39.788 --> 01:32:40.856
(Laughing)

01:32:40.889 --> 01:32:42.290
(Bell tolling)

01:32:44.259 --> 01:32:45.794
Where's the church?

01:32:45.828 --> 01:32:47.562
Right down the road.

01:32:49.698 --> 01:32:51.967
Does the church have
a bathroom?

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.902
Not again!

01:32:53.936 --> 01:32:55.570
(Laughing)

01:33:48.857 --> 01:33:52.094
* I heard the bells
on Christmas Day *

01:33:52.127 --> 01:33:55.664
* Their old
familiar carols play *

01:33:55.698 --> 01:33:59.001
* And wild and sweet
the words repeat *

01:33:59.034 --> 01:34:02.404
* Of peace on earth
good will to men *

01:34:04.372 --> 01:34:06.341
(Scatting)

01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:11.814
* I thought
how as the day had come *

01:34:11.847 --> 01:34:15.150
* The belfries of all
Christendom *

01:34:15.183 --> 01:34:18.854
* Had rolled along
the unbroken song *

01:34:18.887 --> 01:34:21.857
* Of peace on earth

01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:24.727
* Good will

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:28.864
* To men

01:34:28.897 --> 01:34:33.168
* Peace on earth

01:34:35.237 --> 01:34:39.307
* Peace on earth

01:34:46.281 --> 01:34:49.484
* And in despair
I bowed my head *

01:34:49.517 --> 01:34:53.055
* There is no peace on earth
I said *

01:34:53.088 --> 01:34:56.424
* For hate is strong
and mocks the song *

01:34:56.458 --> 01:35:01.229
* Of peace on earth
good will to men *

01:35:01.263 --> 01:35:04.699
(Scatting)

01:35:06.034 --> 01:35:09.371
* Then pealed
the bells more loud and deep *

01:35:09.404 --> 01:35:12.808
* God is not dead nor
doth he sleep *

01:35:12.841 --> 01:35:16.144
* The wrong shall
fail the right prevail *

01:35:16.178 --> 01:35:19.214
* With peace on earth

01:35:19.247 --> 01:35:22.084
* Good will

01:35:22.117 --> 01:35:26.121
* To men

01:35:26.154 --> 01:35:29.324
* Peace on earth

01:35:29.357 --> 01:35:32.527
* And good will

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:36.899
* And peace on earth

01:35:43.872 --> 01:35:47.075
* 'Til ringing
singing on its way *

01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:50.412
* The world revolved from
night to day *

01:35:50.445 --> 01:35:54.016
* A voice
a chime a chant sublime *

01:35:54.049 --> 01:35:57.085
* Of peace on earth

01:35:57.119 --> 01:35:59.988
* Good will

01:36:00.022 --> 01:36:03.458
* To men

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:07.029
* Peace on earth

01:36:07.062 --> 01:36:10.298
* And good will

01:36:10.332 --> 01:36:17.539
* And peace on earth

01:36:18.305 --> 01:36:24.740
