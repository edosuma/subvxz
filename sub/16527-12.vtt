09:25.664 --> 09:28.870
Led him time in San Quentin.
Rumor was he was working

09:28.870 --> 09:31.008
for Angelo Casciano.
AVERY:
Now that's a name

09:31.008 --> 09:32.410
that rings bells.

09:32.410 --> 09:34.147
Angelo Casciano has been
on the LAPD's radar for years.

09:34.147 --> 09:36.753
He's a fence.
Trades in

09:36.753 --> 09:38.690
everything from
drugs to artwork.

09:38.690 --> 09:39.992
We haven't been able
to catch him

09:39.992 --> 09:41.896
'cause no one's been dumb
or ballsy enough to flip on him.

09:41.896 --> 09:43.465
Yeah, could be why
Dino kept his mouth shut

09:43.465 --> 09:45.169
and just did his time.
Parole file

09:45.169 --> 09:47.941
has him working as a fry cook
at a diner in the Valley.

09:47.941 --> 09:49.912
Perfect. I love
fried foods.

09:49.912 --> 09:51.181
Come on, let's go.
Oh.

09:51.181 --> 09:53.787
Um, or maybe...
maybe we should

09:53.787 --> 09:56.458
go to the evidence room and sign
in those drugs that we found.

09:56.458 --> 09:59.330
'Cause that is the proper
protocol, is it not?

09:59.330 --> 10:02.203
Yes. Yes, it is.

I also forgot

10:05.209 --> 10:06.813
that I have got
to run by Cahill's

10:06.813 --> 10:08.115
'cause I don't want to miss
these appointments.

10:08.115 --> 10:09.184
You can handle the
paperwork, right?

10:09.184 --> 10:11.488
I couldn't even operate
a vehicle. How am I gonna

10:11.488 --> 10:14.127

after, like, 15 years?

10:33.867 --> 10:36.138
There's no limitations
on destroying a man's career.

10:36.138 --> 10:37.875

10:43.218 --> 10:44.955
just couldn't see me
being a detective?

10:44.955 --> 10:46.893
I won't go so far as to say

10:46.893 --> 10:48.362
that you would have been
useless,

10:48.362 --> 10:50.099
but I do think that

10:50.099 --> 10:52.069
your talents are best suited
underground.

10:52.069 --> 10:54.307

All because you had

been committed.

Good.

15:11.689 --> 15:14.393

15:20.105 --> 15:21.709

15:21.709 --> 15:23.144
Dino's clean.

of these arraignments.

18:15.321 --> 18:17.827
First of all,
forgive me for earlier.

18:17.827 --> 18:19.931

18:25.543 --> 18:27.880
No. He would not.

Relax, Roger.
Tell him to relax.

19:00.478 --> 19:02.850
How did you ID my client?

19:02.850 --> 19:04.721
We had a DNA sample.

19:04.721 --> 19:07.292
A tainted sample that doesn't
conclusively ID him.

19:07.292 --> 19:09.597
Did you have a warrant
to search his locker?

19:09.597 --> 19:11.968
Uh, no, but when I walked in...
Did you identify yourself

19:11.968 --> 19:13.437
as a police officer?

19:13.437 --> 19:14.507
Absolutely.

19:14.507 --> 19:16.511
Did you show him your badge?

19:16.511 --> 19:19.016
I would have, but I couldn't
find it at that particular time,

19:19.016 --> 19:20.719

19:20.719 --> 19:21.788

19:25.529 --> 19:27.332

the legal hairs you want.

19:28.769 --> 19:30.338

that he was wearing,

19:31.741 --> 19:33.344
and we know his MO.

19:33.344 --> 19:35.916
We all felt that he was guilty.

19:35.916 --> 19:37.352

Oh, I'm sorry.

19:37.352 --> 19:39.356

19:39.356 --> 19:42.295

feel like, huh?

19:42.295 --> 19:44.934

of the throat?

19:44.934 --> 19:46.504

We had more than
a feeling, Trish.

19:46.504 --> 19:48.642
Well, you know who
had a feeling?

19:48.642 --> 19:50.512
Mr. Brant.

19:50.512 --> 19:52.048

unkempt,

19:52.048 --> 19:55.789

his locker.

19:55.789 --> 19:58.060

out is that your client

19:58.060 --> 19:59.664

TRISH: And where was
your partner

19:59.664 --> 20:01.534
during all of this? Hmm?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.538
Or did you go there alone

20:03.538 --> 20:05.809
so you could violate my client's
constitutional rights

20:05.809 --> 20:07.680
without a witness?

20:07.680 --> 20:10.686
My partner was detained,

20:10.686 --> 20:12.690
and, uh, he was late
arriving to the scene.

20:12.690 --> 20:14.761
Oh. Okay.

20:14.761 --> 20:16.363

20:18.969 --> 20:21.975
Sometimes we find more success
in divide and conquer.

20:21.975 --> 20:23.044

20:24.614 --> 20:26.016
RIGGS:
Well, we had several leads

20:26.016 --> 20:27.620
that, uh, we needed to follow,

20:27.620 --> 20:28.789

TRISH:
Your Honor.

20:28.789 --> 20:30.659

is being evasive.

20:30.659 --> 20:32.797
He has a reputation
for going rogue

20:32.797 --> 20:34.534
and not following procedure,
because of his unwillingness

20:34.534 --> 20:35.803

20:35.803 --> 20:39.009
I move to have this case
dismissed immediately.

information.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.029

behind because...

Where was your partner?

20:51.100 --> 20:53.839
He had heart problems
earlier today, Trish.

20:53.839 --> 20:55.542
And I was worried about him.

20:55.542 --> 20:56.845

Anything else, Detective?

swinging by dinner tonight.

I owe you an apology.

27:18.340 --> 27:19.810
You were right.

27:19.810 --> 27:20.979
Dino is innocent.

27:22.081 --> 27:23.818
Can you repeat that?

27:27.291 --> 27:29.963
I should make you get down
on your knees

27:29.963 --> 27:32.101
and beg for my forgiveness.

27:32.101 --> 27:33.971
I know
that's supposed to be scary,

And I think that Dino's being
silent to protect his brother.

27:44.325 --> 27:45.995
So I'm gonna
need a favor.

27:45.995 --> 27:47.866
What kind of favor?

27:47.866 --> 27:49.870
I need you to set a meeting
with Dino and us.

arrest the right person

27:52.141 --> 27:53.410

in something very dangerous.

28:02.996 --> 28:04.498
I'll set it up.

28:04.498 --> 28:06.971
But I want your word

28:06.971 --> 28:09.442

of the department handle this.

to clean up your life, right?

29:35.548 --> 29:37.952
It'd be a shame for it
to end all right here.

29:37.952 --> 29:39.956
They kidnapped my brother.

29:39.956 --> 29:41.292
Okay? And they will

29:41.292 --> 29:43.363

29:43.363 --> 29:45.968
So let me help you, all right?
But start

I take it and feed it to you.

29:48.507 --> 29:51.279
You think I trust the cops?
No, but you
trust Trish,

29:51.279 --> 29:53.249

38:34.190 --> 38:35.794
that matters

38:35.794 --> 38:38.533
is that we caught
Angelo Casciano.

38:38.533 --> 38:40.169
Amen.
Do you know how
long I've wanted

38:40.169 --> 38:41.539
to put him behind bars?

38:41.539 --> 38:43.075
He's been on my bucket list
for years.

38:43.075 --> 38:44.945
(laughs)

38:44.945 --> 38:47.183
I mean, Cap, that's...
that's kind of sad.

38:47.183 --> 38:49.722
I mean, you need to take a look
at that bucket list.
Yeah.

38:49.722 --> 38:51.926
You know?
What you need to do

38:51.926 --> 38:53.530
is go sign the drugs

38:53.530 --> 38:54.798
back into evidence
and then there's

38:54.798 --> 38:56.936
something about‐about
a beer with Monty?

38:56.936 --> 38:58.540
You know what, fine.

38:58.540 --> 39:00.009
I happen to like Monty.

39:00.009 --> 39:01.679
Ooh, here's an idea:

39:01.679 --> 39:02.881
maybe I'll bring him by
your house for dinner later.

39:02.881 --> 39:04.618
(gasps) Ooh!

39:04.618 --> 39:06.054
Don't you dare, Riggs.

39:06.054 --> 39:07.891
How's that ticker of yours, Rog?

39:07.891 --> 39:10.062
Wha... F‐Fine, why?

39:10.062 --> 39:12.768
Stop. Look, I get why

39:12.768 --> 39:14.204
you didn't want
everyone around here to know,

39:14.204 --> 39:16.074
but there's something
you need to know:

39:16.074 --> 39:18.178
there is not a person
in this division‐‐

39:18.178 --> 39:19.648
hell, the entire LAPD‐‐

39:19.648 --> 39:21.051
who thinks that
you are damaged goods.

39:21.051 --> 39:22.955
So get that
out of your head.

39:24.792 --> 39:26.562
Thanks.

39:26.562 --> 39:27.965
And please
take care of yourself.

39:27.965 --> 39:29.868
If you haven't noticed,
you're the best cop I got.

39:40.122 --> 39:43.696
I did my best to keep him away
from that life, I swear.

39:43.696 --> 39:46.034
Everybody makes
their own decisions.

39:46.034 --> 39:47.704
Nothing you could do about that.

39:49.708 --> 39:50.577
Yeah.

39:50.577 --> 39:52.514
He's not cut out
for prison, though.

39:52.514 --> 39:54.150
They're gonna
eat him up in there.

39:54.150 --> 39:56.722
If he testifies against Angelo,

39:56.722 --> 39:58.593
I'll cut him a deal
with the D. A.

39:58.593 --> 39:59.895
He will.

39:59.895 --> 40:01.599
You have my word.

40:01.599 --> 40:04.003
Okay.

40:04.003 --> 40:05.005
Hey.

40:06.274 --> 40:07.811
I'm sorry.

40:07.811 --> 40:09.615
I feel like I let you down.

40:09.615 --> 40:11.217
You did what you had to do.

40:12.754 --> 40:14.625
I will never forget

40:14.625 --> 40:15.894
how you cared enough

40:15.894 --> 40:18.766
to put time into me, I swear.

40:18.766 --> 40:21.237
All I can say
is thank you

40:21.237 --> 40:24.645
for looking out for me
once again.

40:24.645 --> 40:27.183
Thanks for trusting me.
Hey.

40:27.183 --> 40:29.788
Thank you for being someone

40:29.788 --> 40:31.792
that I could trust.

40:31.792 --> 40:33.830
Okay?

40:36.969 --> 40:38.840
I'm proud of you.

40:38.840 --> 40:40.075
(elevator bell dings)

40:42.848 --> 40:44.217
Hey.

40:44.217 --> 40:46.221
Hey.

40:46.221 --> 40:48.826
How's Murtaugh?

40:48.826 --> 40:51.231
Oh, you know,
got a little wet,

40:51.231 --> 40:52.868
but, uh...

40:52.868 --> 40:54.838
he'll live.

40:54.838 --> 40:57.376
I would ask how you're doing,
but we both know how that goes.

40:57.376 --> 40:59.046
Well, I did almost drown.

40:59.046 --> 41:00.984
I mean, I was thinking
about that, but...

41:04.357 --> 41:06.194
How are you doing, Riggs?

41:06.194 --> 41:08.098
I'm a little hungry.

41:08.098 --> 41:10.603
Thanks for asking.

41:10.603 --> 41:12.106

Amen to that.

That's what I'm talking about.
Mm‐hmm. The only thing

41:52.787 --> 41:55.192
I would want to do different
is the type of exercise.

41:55.192 --> 41:58.900

there's this new thing
