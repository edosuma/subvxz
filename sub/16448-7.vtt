WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:04.872
Oh, you're, uh...

00:04.938 --> 00:07.275
having the last slice
of pie, huh?

00:07.341 --> 00:10.978
Yes, I had a hankering
for a midnight snack.

00:11.045 --> 00:13.514
Yeah, me too.
Uh...

00:13.581 --> 00:14.815
I guess I'll just have
an apple.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.517
That's nature's dessert
right there.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.954
So you're up late,
huh?

00:21.021 --> 00:23.324
Yes, uh,
just working on my app,

00:23.391 --> 00:25.059
had a couple of glitches.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.460
Sometimes
it's overwhelming.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.196
I mean, you're creating
your own app.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.730
And you're marrying
my daughter.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.031
You got a lot going on.

00:31.099 --> 00:33.234
I-I'm amazed
at how you balance it all,

00:33.301 --> 00:34.868
how you do that,
you know?

00:34.935 --> 00:36.370
It's really nice
to hear you say that.

00:36.437 --> 00:39.340
I -- Sometimes I feel like
I'm on an island.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.941
Actually, you are.
It's Long Island.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.044
But you said something
about a-a glitch

00:44.112 --> 00:45.546
or something like that?

00:45.613 --> 00:47.848
Oh, yes, well, uh,
what I'm working
with here is, uh --

00:47.915 --> 00:51.185
it's a new technology,
but with any program, okay,

00:51.252 --> 00:54.188
once you fix one set of code,
it triggers another problem...

00:54.255 --> 00:55.989
Mm-hmm.
...and another problem
and another.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.425
It's like dominoes.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.393
Oh, yeah,
perfect analogy, Mr. Gable.
Yeah. Right.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.930
But the good part
is that once I'm done...
Right.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.532
...I am ready to beta test.

01:04.598 --> 01:05.699
( Chuckles )
Wow.

01:05.766 --> 01:06.800
Now,
what's all that about?

01:06.867 --> 01:08.336
Oh, well,
I can show you that.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.638
Uh, you see, there is
a small control group, okay,

01:10.704 --> 01:12.640
and they will have access
to your product.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.575
And you can see what aspects
are working,

01:14.642 --> 01:16.144
what parts
need to be improved,

01:16.210 --> 01:18.279
and then that's --
that's all you have there.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.181
( Muffled ) That is ama--
I mean, it's...

01:20.248 --> 01:22.150
Oh, yeah.
If -- If you ever want,

01:22.216 --> 01:23.884
please, come by
the garage tomorrow.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.453
I can -- I can show you.
I would love t--

01:25.519 --> 01:27.721
I go to check 'cause I got
a thing with the thing,

01:27.788 --> 01:29.357
but, uh, yeah,
maybe I'll do that.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.791
I'll look into that.
It sounds great. All right.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.092
Fantastic.
Thank you, Mr. Gable.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.561
You have
a lovely night.
Mm-hmm.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.796
( Chuckles )

01:35.863 --> 01:39.066
He ate my pie.

01:39.133 --> 01:44.004
* I am not your ordinary guy

01:48.909 --> 01:52.846
Mr. Gable,
happy All Hallow's Eve.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.515
Wow.

01:54.582 --> 01:55.816
I got to say,
for the first time,

01:55.883 --> 01:58.619
I'm not in the mood
for bacon.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.354
It's a couples' costume.

02:00.421 --> 02:03.056
A-And as your daughter
comes downstairs,

02:03.123 --> 02:04.725
everything will come
into focus.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.829
Oh, yeah. Razor sharp.

02:08.896 --> 02:11.199
What happened? You were
supposed to be an egg.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.666
I know.
I tried it, babe.

02:12.733 --> 02:13.734
But it made me
look dumpy,

02:13.801 --> 02:15.203
and I couldn't see
through the yolk.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.070
Wonderful.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.139
We are
the classic combination --

02:19.207 --> 02:21.175
bacon and princess.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.411
Jack, Sara, let's go.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.879
Oh, I like it.
That looks good.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.581
Hey, guys, have fun tonight,
all right?

02:27.648 --> 02:29.917
Listen to bacon and princess.
Mostly princess, all right?

02:29.983 --> 02:31.519
Just -- You know what?
Ignore bacon.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.590
Hey.
Hey.

02:36.657 --> 02:37.925
Nice hat.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.193
( Groans )
The kids at school,

02:39.260 --> 02:40.428
they thought
it would be funny

02:40.494 --> 02:42.095
if I was dressed
like an ugly witch.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.797
Well, we'll see
how funny they think

02:43.864 --> 02:45.165
their flu shots
are tomorrow

02:45.233 --> 02:47.368
when I keep
missing the muscle.

02:47.435 --> 02:50.504
Wow, you went
a little dark there, hon.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.006
I did.
I'm just exhausted.

02:53.073 --> 02:54.942
So now let's get ready
to pass out candy

02:55.008 --> 02:56.844
to the little angels.
( Weakly ) Yay.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.111
( Chuckles )

02:58.178 --> 03:00.614
Well, if you're talking
about the fun-sized ones

03:00.681 --> 03:03.384
that you tried hiding from me,
I got to be honest --

03:03.451 --> 03:05.319
I had a lot of fun
finding them

03:05.386 --> 03:08.389
and even more fun
eating them.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.391
Well, I am not
because those were the decoys.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.226
No, the real ones
are in the piano bench.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.695
Found them. Ate them.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.330
Behind the piano, too?

03:16.397 --> 03:18.799
See, this is why
we have trust issues.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.937
Is it horrible that I want
this night to be over,

03:24.004 --> 03:25.673
and it hasn't even
started?

03:29.710 --> 03:30.944
What if it was over?

03:31.011 --> 03:32.179
I'm sorry?

03:32.246 --> 03:34.582
What if we didn't
hand out candy this year?

03:34.648 --> 03:36.317
Just throwing it out there.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.685
We can't do that.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.487
We've played by the rules
for 20 years.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.788
We put in our time.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.423
Who says we got to get up
from the couch

03:42.490 --> 03:44.625
every five seconds
to hand out candy to kids

03:44.692 --> 03:49.863
not because they deserve it,
but because they rang a bell?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.064
I mean,
if you think about it,

03:51.131 --> 03:52.666
the whole thing
is just kind of a charade.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.801
Not "kinda."

03:53.867 --> 03:55.403
"Oh, I'm an astronaut."
No, you're not.

03:55.469 --> 03:58.171
You're little Timmy Cicero
from down the block.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.341
You can barely ride
a skateboard.

04:00.408 --> 04:03.010
You expect me
to believe you're landing
a-a lunar modular

04:03.076 --> 04:04.945
on the moon?

04:05.012 --> 04:06.580
Lunar modular?
You gonna stick with that?

04:06.647 --> 04:09.617
You know what I mean.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.452
It would be kind of nice
not to do it at all.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.786
Then let's not.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.355
It's time the Gables
take a stand

04:14.422 --> 04:16.223
and we show the world
we are not ashamed.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.592
Well,
how would we do that?
We hide.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.795
We turn off every light,

04:21.862 --> 04:24.264
and we send out a message
that says,

04:24.332 --> 04:26.199
"You know what?
We are closed for business."

04:26.266 --> 04:27.368
Do you think
that would work?

04:27.435 --> 04:28.836
It worked
for McDonald's, right?

04:28.902 --> 04:30.704
After midnight, you're rolling
out there, "I want a burger,"

04:30.771 --> 04:32.105
but you can't find it
and the place is closed.

04:32.172 --> 04:35.576
And you know how you know?
Dark arches.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.110
The arches are dark.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.246
The saddest sight
in all of fast food.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.914
And then,
what happens next?

04:40.981 --> 04:42.750
Well, if it's you,
you punch the dashboard,

04:42.816 --> 04:45.252
and then we drive 20 miles to
the one that's open in Queens?

04:46.420 --> 04:47.821
Exactly!

04:47.888 --> 04:49.623
I move on
to the next one, right?

04:49.690 --> 04:51.425
And that's
what the kids will do.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.293
They will move on
to the next house

04:53.361 --> 04:59.367
because tonight
the Gables have...dark arches.

04:59.433 --> 05:03.003
Okay. Okay! Yeah!
Let's do this.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.738
Look at us.
We got our own thing.
Mm-hmm.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.874
Hallow-We-Ain't-Home!

05:06.940 --> 05:09.677
Holla back, y'all!

05:09.743 --> 05:12.880
**

05:12.946 --> 05:15.282
Look, when we get in there,
we got to stay quiet, okay?

05:15.349 --> 05:16.817
Well, shouldn't we
just go upstairs?

05:16.884 --> 05:18.586
No, the TV downstairs
is much better.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.522
We can't watch "Taken"
on a small screen.

05:21.589 --> 05:24.725
It's an insult
to Liam Neeson and...

05:24.792 --> 05:27.761
he will find us.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.731
Wait a minute.
We're watching "Taken" again?

05:30.798 --> 05:31.865
You've seen it 10 times.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.667
You said we could watch
"Pitch Perfect."

05:33.734 --> 05:36.003
That's when I thought
it was about baseball.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.406
Once I learned
it was about a competitive
a cappella group,

05:38.472 --> 05:41.542
I wanted to run through a wall
into another wall.

05:41.609 --> 05:44.077
( Groans ) Fine.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.179
All right, come on.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.781
Hey, remember
to stay quiet

05:47.848 --> 05:49.783
and don't go near
the windows, okay?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.051
Okay.
All right.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.453
This is kind of
exciting.
Yeah.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.555
It's so wrong,
yet so right.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.723
( Chuckles )

05:55.789 --> 05:56.957
By the way,
if this works out,

05:57.024 --> 05:58.726
we should do this
with other holidays, right?

05:58.792 --> 06:00.828
I mean, like, who really needs
Valentine's Day?

06:00.894 --> 06:03.397
Yeah, and why do I have to
cook for every Thanksgiving?

06:05.499 --> 06:07.935
( Doorbell rings )

06:08.001 --> 06:10.003
Stay calm.
They can't see us.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.372
Children: Trick or treat!

06:12.440 --> 06:14.107
Oh,
they sound so cute.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.242
They're probably little
ballerinas or something.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.510
I can't. I can't.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.479
Abandon ship.
Abandon ship.
Shh! Hey, stop.

06:18.546 --> 06:19.813
Stop. Look at me.
Look at me.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.483
The first one
is always the toughest.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.852
Trick or treat!

06:24.918 --> 06:26.153
This is killing me.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.921
Just ride it out.

06:27.988 --> 06:32.726
Girl: Mommy, I guess
no one's home. Let's just
go to the next house.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.364
And we're through it.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.467
There you have it.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.469
Dark arches.
Dark arches.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.106
How goes
the trunk-or-treating?

06:46.173 --> 06:47.407
The best.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.643
No knocking on doors
or walking to the next house.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.745
You go from car to car
and take what you want.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.715
It's like
we're robbing these people.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.484
You know
who's being robbed?

06:56.550 --> 06:57.651
Me.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.419
No one's gotten my costume
all night.

06:59.487 --> 07:00.754
Why don't you just
take the hat off

07:00.821 --> 07:01.889
and be a regular cookie?

07:01.955 --> 07:03.090
You're just jealous

07:03.156 --> 07:04.925
'cause you're never
gonna wear one of these.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.796
You know, I got to say,

07:08.862 --> 07:10.964
trunk-or-treating
is kind of romantic.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.065
Chale:
Speaking of treats,

07:12.132 --> 07:16.103
a little serenade
for my princess.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.238
( Falsetto )
* Kendra, Kendra

07:18.305 --> 07:20.373
* More than a friend-a

07:20.440 --> 07:22.510
( Loud bass music playing )
* Chale, Chale, Chale

07:22.576 --> 07:24.778
* What a perfect male

07:24.845 --> 07:26.880
* Chale, Chale, Chale

07:26.947 --> 07:28.749
* What a perfect...

07:28.816 --> 07:30.217
( Louder )
* Kendra, Ken--

07:31.351 --> 07:33.120
Come on.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.622
This is intolerable.

07:34.688 --> 07:35.789
Unbelievable.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.199
And yet
it is a free country,

07:46.266 --> 07:48.335
and that's why
I love America.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.473
So, if I was ever taken,

07:53.541 --> 07:56.610
how far would you go
to save me, hmm?

07:56.677 --> 07:58.145
Well, I mean, I --

07:58.211 --> 08:00.548
I'd definitely
want you back.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.983
No, good to hear.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.619
You know, I...would ask
your girlfriends

08:05.686 --> 08:11.058
if they'd seen you
and put up some fliers.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.526
Liam Neeson --

08:12.593 --> 08:14.427
He flies to Europe and he's
snapping people's necks

08:14.494 --> 08:17.164
and you're gonna
put up some fliers?

08:17.230 --> 08:19.066
With a reward,
you know?
Oh.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.433
I got to be honest --

08:20.500 --> 08:21.902
I don't know if I could
learn another language and...

08:21.969 --> 08:22.970
Sure.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.404
...fly
to another country.

08:24.471 --> 08:25.839
You got to figure out
their money and stuff.
Right.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.307
I don't even --
Do I have a passport?

08:27.374 --> 08:28.809
I don't even know
if I have a passport.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.711
( Doorbell rings )

08:30.778 --> 08:32.445
Children: Trick or treat!

08:33.681 --> 08:35.616
( Doorbell rings )

08:35.683 --> 08:38.952
Boy: Trick or treat!
We see your car
in the driveway.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.822
( Doorbell ringing rapidly )

08:41.889 --> 08:44.291
No, no, no, no, no. It's okay.
They'll leave.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.794
Hey. I smell popcorn.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.962
Give me a boost.
I'll look through the window.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.631
( Whispers )
Get low. Get low.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.506
Okay.
I think they're gone.

08:59.573 --> 09:00.741
( Whispers )
Lower your voice.

09:00.808 --> 09:03.844
I think they're gone.
Stop...screaming.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.780
Come on, guys. Let's go.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.783
All right,
Now we'll go check.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.018
Okay.

09:12.586 --> 09:13.954
What? Get down.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.656
This is down as I get.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.501
They might know
we're here.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.041
( Loud bass music plays )

09:34.107 --> 09:35.575
Okay, enough is enough.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.911
I mean, why can't they just
play something more soothing,

09:37.978 --> 09:40.614
like a car alarm?

09:40.681 --> 09:42.015
I'd go over
and talk to him,

09:42.082 --> 09:45.552
but the Viking seems busy
with his decorations.

09:45.619 --> 09:46.654
Fine, I'll do it.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.721
No, no, no.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.222
I'll deal with it.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.659
I just want to be sure
to keep my rage in check.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.262
Okay. Fine.
Here I go.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.569
Okay, Chale.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.471
Brave bacon.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.373
Brave bacon.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.642
( Chuckles )

10:08.709 --> 10:09.943
Excuse me.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.444
( Chuckles )

10:11.511 --> 10:13.647
'Sup, bro?

10:13.714 --> 10:19.486
Uh, my fiancee and I,
uh, we're really
big fans of music,

10:19.552 --> 10:22.389
a-also really big fans
of Vikings.

10:22.455 --> 10:26.059
The way you plunder
a village -- to die for.

10:26.126 --> 10:30.998
Um, we feel maybe the music
is just a --

10:31.064 --> 10:32.733
just a tad too loud.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.135
( Chuckles )

10:38.772 --> 10:39.873
I'm so sorry.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.942
( Volume lowers )

10:42.009 --> 10:44.077
Thank you so much.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.446
My girlfriend --
She likes it loud.

10:46.513 --> 10:48.716
She's a strong cup
of coffee.

10:48.782 --> 10:49.783
( Chuckles )

10:49.850 --> 10:52.052
I, too, am familiar
with that brew.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.761
They shaving-creamed
the car.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.896
I just washed it, too.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.097
You know, I'm going out there.
That's it.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.734
No, honey. Don't, okay?
They're just kids.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.401
All right,
we'll take the high road,

11:08.468 --> 11:10.137
and we will
clean everything tomorrow.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.372
Okay, you're right.
Take the high road.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.640
Yes.

11:13.707 --> 11:14.875
They just stole
our "Welcome" sign.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.076
What?!

11:16.143 --> 11:20.413
My grandmother
made that sign for us.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.282
Oh, you know what?
Those are the Gruber kids.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.284
That's it.
I'm calling their parents.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.653
Well, not sure Rick and Judy
are gonna pick up

11:26.720 --> 11:28.822
because they're driving
the getaway car.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.526
Oh, those bastards
are going down.

11:33.593 --> 11:36.029
I guess we're off
the high road now.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.799
Oh, yeah.
We're way off.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.368
( Sighs )

11:41.434 --> 11:43.270
Looks like our noise problem
was handled.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.472
Oh, wow, that's amazing.
What did you say to him?

11:45.538 --> 11:48.075
I went over there.
He had a bit of an attitude.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.811
He's like, "What's up, bro?"
And I shut that down.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.146
( Chuckles )
I was having none of it.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.381
Wow. Good on you, babe.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.448
Oh.

11:55.515 --> 11:56.817
Well, when thunder needs
bringing,

11:56.884 --> 11:58.418
I tend to bring it.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.953
Megan:
Don't tell me to relax!

12:00.020 --> 12:01.989
Who told you
to turn my music off?!

12:02.055 --> 12:03.123
It was just some guy.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.257
( Mockingly )
"Just some guy"!

12:04.324 --> 12:09.029
You're so boring!
Get some personality!

12:09.096 --> 12:10.831
Honey, why are you
acting like this?

12:10.898 --> 12:13.400
You make me crazy!
You're so monotone!

12:13.466 --> 12:16.503
Why do I even
like you?!

12:16.569 --> 12:17.771
Who was it?!

12:17.838 --> 12:20.573
Uh, we should probably
start the car.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.641
What?

12:28.481 --> 12:29.917
( Grunts )

12:34.154 --> 12:36.056
( Strained )
I can't swing my legs over.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.557
It ain't happening.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.226
The gate's unlocked.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.096
Thank you, God.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.165
What did you bring?

12:45.232 --> 12:47.134
What is all this?

12:47.200 --> 12:49.736
It's toilet paper
and shaving cream.
What?

12:49.803 --> 12:51.304
If I learned anything
from being a cop,

12:51.371 --> 12:53.106
it's that you never
show up unarmed.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.142
Honey, this is not
about payback, okay?

12:55.208 --> 12:57.010
It's about getting our sign
and just --

12:57.077 --> 12:59.646
By the way, how much
toilet paper did you bring?

12:59.712 --> 13:01.448
Is that every roll
in the house?

13:01.514 --> 13:04.017
It is. Yeah.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.585
Maybe we should hang on
to a few of these.

13:05.652 --> 13:06.854
Okay.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.221
( Gasps ) Oh, there's
the sign. I'll go get it.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.356
Hey, wait, wait, wait!

13:09.422 --> 13:11.124
They got a lot of lights
up there.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.760
Those could be
motion sensors.
Okay.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.571
Okay. Okay.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.806
Okay, Jackie Chan,
I think we're good.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.308
I'll tell you
when we're good.

13:29.376 --> 13:30.911
We're good.
Okay.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.445
All right,
I'm gonna go get it.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.646
Okay.
This is exciting.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.015
Hurry up.
Okay, I'm coming.

13:35.082 --> 13:38.451
( Gasps )
They snapped our bird's neck.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.288
Ohh!
Look at what they did!

13:41.354 --> 13:43.623
You know what?
Yes, I'm gonna do this.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.092
Hey!
Take this, Grubers!

13:45.158 --> 13:46.293
Yes!
Okay.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.460
Ohh, that felt good.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.962
A couple things.
Yeah!

13:49.029 --> 13:50.964
You're supposed
to unroll it first.
Oh.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.499
And you ended up in the
kiddie pool right there.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.833
You're supposed to throw it
in a tree.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.668
Oh, that would be
much better.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.005
What was that?

13:58.071 --> 13:59.139
Ohh!

13:59.206 --> 14:00.340
( Gasps )
I'm hit!

14:00.407 --> 14:03.010
Ohh!
I love this sweater!

14:03.076 --> 14:04.577
( Gasps )
Run!

14:04.644 --> 14:06.513
Grab the sign!
Grab the sign!

14:09.416 --> 14:10.583
It's a trap!

14:10.650 --> 14:11.818
Take cover!
Oh, God!

14:11.885 --> 14:13.053
Over there!

14:13.120 --> 14:14.587
Here!

14:14.654 --> 14:16.323
Go! Go!

14:16.389 --> 14:17.424
Ow!

14:17.490 --> 14:18.591
( Screams )
Go! Go!

14:18.658 --> 14:20.994
I'm going!
Go!

14:21.061 --> 14:22.862
Go, go, go, go.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.331
Donna: Close it!
Close it! Close it!

14:28.668 --> 14:29.702
Are you all right?

14:29.769 --> 14:30.904
Yeah, yeah.
No, I'm great.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.339
I'm trapped
in a kids' playhouse,

14:32.405 --> 14:34.007
and I'm wearing
a scrambled-egg sweater.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.442
Best Halloween ever.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.545
Okay.

14:38.611 --> 14:39.812
All right.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.049
I think they're done.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.283
( Tape tearing )

14:48.888 --> 14:50.157
What is that?

14:50.223 --> 14:51.925
I think they're
duct-taping us in here.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.328
Oh, no!
What?

14:55.395 --> 14:58.265
It worked.
We're trapped like ducks.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.070
Hey, babe, you know
it's not "duck" tape, right?

15:03.136 --> 15:05.905
That it's duct
with a "T"?

15:07.607 --> 15:09.409
Yeah, I know.

15:09.476 --> 15:10.743
But do you?
Yeah, I know.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.145
It's an expression --
"trapped like ducks."

15:12.212 --> 15:13.680
You never heard of that?
No.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.914
Oh, come on.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.255
I still got no service.
No bars.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.890
Well,
move around a little.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.492
Oh, good call.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.260
Let me move to the east wing
of the property.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.265
Still nothing.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.002
( Groans )

15:35.068 --> 15:37.570
Oh, why are these people
so mad at us?

15:37.637 --> 15:38.638
I don't know.

15:38.705 --> 15:39.973
I can understand
the kids being mad,

15:40.040 --> 15:41.074
but I mean,
Rick and Judy?

15:41.141 --> 15:42.242
We didn't do anything
to them.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.943
We have always been
really good neighbors.

15:46.013 --> 15:48.615
Oh.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.117
What?

15:50.183 --> 15:51.484
It's not a big thing,

15:51.551 --> 15:53.820
but I did borrow
Rick's leaf blower,

15:53.886 --> 15:56.656
and it was
very powerful.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.091
Powerful enough to,
say,

15:58.158 --> 16:00.293
propel a full-grown man
in an inner tube

16:00.360 --> 16:01.995
around in a circle
in a pool.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.765
Our pool.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.603
I'm that full-grown man.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.871
You don't say.

16:11.938 --> 16:13.373
And what happened?

16:13.440 --> 16:16.676
Well, the trick is to not
submerge the whole thing

16:16.743 --> 16:18.645
in water fully.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.414
And I guess I did that,
you know?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.950
Sure, sure, you did.
And did you have it fixed?

16:24.017 --> 16:25.052
I did.
Of course I did.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.519
I mean,
my buddy Wendell, though,

16:26.586 --> 16:28.988
apparently is not
an authorized dealer,

16:29.056 --> 16:32.725
and it completely voided out
the warranty

16:32.792 --> 16:35.928
and Rick got all mad
and we got into
a heated argument

16:35.995 --> 16:39.099
and his wife, out of nowhere,
called me a moron.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.467
I panicked,
and I called her --

16:40.533 --> 16:43.303
I think
it was something like a...

16:43.370 --> 16:47.074
Big Booty Judy.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.742
Big Booty Judy?

16:49.809 --> 16:51.711
Are you kidding me?

16:51.778 --> 16:53.380
I'm not proud,
all right?
Ohh.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.014
It was
a knee-jerk reaction.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.050
Oh, so we're trapped in here
because of you.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.518
No, we are here

16:58.585 --> 17:00.853
because you had to go get your
precious grandmother's sign --

17:00.920 --> 17:02.989
"Welcome
to the Gable Stable."

17:03.056 --> 17:05.425
We live on a quarter acre
in Massapequa.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.993
Like, we're out back
with a bunch of horses.

17:07.060 --> 17:11.064
"Come on, Jack. Let's get on
back to the Gable Stable!"

17:11.131 --> 17:13.433
Wow! You know what?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.902
I feel like I need a break
from hearing your voice
right now.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.671
So I will be
in the kitchen.

17:22.509 --> 17:25.678
( Sighs )

17:25.745 --> 17:26.846
I'm really sorry,
all right?

17:26.913 --> 17:30.150
This whole thing
is my fault.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.685
You know, you could step up
and fight me on some of this

17:32.752 --> 17:35.222
if you want to.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.889
We don't need to argue
about it right now.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.358
We need to get
out of here.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.527
I agree. There's no telling
what these kids could do.

17:40.593 --> 17:44.997
They already duck --
duct-taped us in.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.999
Look, we need
to cut that tape.
How?

17:47.066 --> 17:49.536
There -- There's literally
nothing sharp enough to do it.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.905
There actually could be
one thing.
What?

17:55.242 --> 17:57.009
My grandmother's sign?
No.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.312
Yeah, I-I crash this thing
into a thousand pieces.

17:59.379 --> 18:00.480
I get, like, a shiv,

18:00.547 --> 18:02.515
and we are ripped out of here
in a second.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.751
Oh, well, make it quick.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.519
Ohh.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.620
( Screams )

18:10.690 --> 18:12.625
I hit the knee.

18:12.692 --> 18:13.693
Right on the knee.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.130
Okay.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.098
( Screams )

18:19.166 --> 18:20.433
Okay, no.
You know what?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.602
You just -- You got
to break that door down.

18:22.669 --> 18:23.736
What?
Yeah.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.372
You got to go full
bull-in-a-China-shop.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.574
With that body,
you could bust right through.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.941
"That body"?

18:29.008 --> 18:31.411
Uh, because --
Uh, because it's muscle.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.812
Because you're --
'Cause you're mostly muscle.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.714
It is mostly muscle.
I'm not -- I'm not saying

18:34.781 --> 18:36.283
there's not other stuff
in there,

18:36.349 --> 18:38.385
but it is mostly muscle
and bone and things
of structure.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.086
Yeah, no,
and that's what I meant.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.121
That's 100% what I meant.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.556
( Sighs )
Let's do it.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.725
I couldn't even break a sign.
How am I breaking this door?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.394
Because you can do it!

18:47.460 --> 18:49.696
All right, we break
through this thing, okay,

18:49.762 --> 18:51.464
we hop that fence,
and we run back home, okay?

18:51.531 --> 18:52.732
Yes, yes,
and we do it fast

18:52.799 --> 18:53.966
because, really, I actually
got to pee real bad.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.835
Okay, all right.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.270
( Both scream )

18:57.337 --> 18:59.806
Oh!

18:59.872 --> 19:01.007
Honey, are you okay?

19:01.073 --> 19:02.609
( Straining )
My shoulder hurts pretty bad.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.678
It's hard to tell
in the dark.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.347
Oh, babe,
let's get out of here.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.382
( Groans )
Okay, okay.

19:09.449 --> 19:10.917
Come on, come on.
Can you mo--

19:10.983 --> 19:13.420
R-- Rick!

19:13.486 --> 19:15.822
All right, I'm sorry
about the leaf blower!
Yeah.

19:15.888 --> 19:19.392
Your -- Your wife was right.
I-I am a moron.

19:19.459 --> 19:22.895
Okay, I just --
My apologies to her.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.064
Rick:
You mean Big Booty Judy?

19:25.131 --> 19:26.165
Now!

19:26.233 --> 19:27.300
Oh, oh!

19:27.367 --> 19:28.601
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.802
Save yourself!
Oh, God!

19:29.869 --> 19:30.903
Save yourself!

19:30.970 --> 19:32.138
( Screams )

19:32.839 --> 19:34.173
Ow!

19:36.743 --> 19:37.944
Come on, Donna!

19:38.010 --> 19:40.480
Okay.

19:40.547 --> 19:44.884
( Both grunting )

19:44.951 --> 19:48.455
I'm not sorry!
I'm not sorry!

19:52.525 --> 19:54.761
Hello?

19:54.827 --> 19:55.895
Hello?

19:55.962 --> 19:57.464
Honey,
it's after 11:00.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.366
Yeah, dad,
they're obviously closed.

19:59.432 --> 20:02.068
It's probably best
if you don't eat so late.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.842
We're ready
to give our order.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.611
Are you ready
to take it?

20:13.145 --> 20:15.682
Ready to take the order
of us?

20:15.748 --> 20:18.117
We're ready. Hello?

20:18.184 --> 20:19.519
Come on.
One time.

20:21.488 --> 20:22.922
( Sighs )

20:22.989 --> 20:26.259
Dark arches.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.597
I'm sorry, honey.

20:30.663 --> 20:33.933
So...
let's just go home?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.202
We're going to Queens.

20:39.539 --> 20:42.842
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

20:42.909 --> 20:46.379
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

20:46.446 --> 20:48.581
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:48.648 --> 20:50.116
* Do, do, do, do

20:50.182 --> 20:53.720
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

20:53.786 --> 20:56.789
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

20:56.856 --> 20:59.492
* I just don't want no...
