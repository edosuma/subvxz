<i>(Ines) My roommate Lena is</i>
<i>a time traveler! How cool</i>

00:50.316 --> 00:51.451
Woooooo!

00:51.484 --> 00:53.520
<i>(Ines) She kind of has a</i>
<i>hard time adjusting.</i>

00:53.554 --> 00:55.221
I'm gonna rick
this!

00:55.255 --> 00:56.823
(Ines) Especially with
Max, her dance partner.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.358
Do you have to be so
forward?

00:58.391 --> 01:00.761
<i>(Ines) Her boyfriend Henri</i>
<i>landed in some random</i>
<i>year.</i>

01:00.794 --> 01:02.362
I'm a year behind

(Ines) <i>But lucky for him he's</i>
<i>found a mysterious</i>
<i>clockshop...</i>

01:04.330 --> 01:05.732
(Oscar) This is a
place out of time.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.568
(Ines) ...that
might have some
answers.

01:14.841 --> 01:19.379
(Lena) Hi Henri. I know
you won't ever get this but I
just miss you so much.

01:19.412 --> 01:23.584
I hope you're all right.
I can't imagine what this must
be like for you.

01:23.617 --> 01:27.487
I wish you were here,
although you'd laugh at
seeing me try to fit in.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.690
I've made a list of new
phrases. Ready?

01:29.723 --> 01:34.194
"Check it out". And "word on
the street". That means
gossip...

01:35.796 --> 01:40.834
Dancing is so different
here. They do all kinds of
dance that's nothing like
ballet.

01:42.202 --> 01:44.871
A new friend is going to
show me some "rad new
moves".

01:44.905 --> 01:48.241
I have no idea if rad is a good
or a bad thing.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.878
It's really quite
awesome. But, I miss
home...

01:52.445 --> 01:53.747
(Jeff
beatboxing)

01:54.314 --> 01:55.849
(Lena) Oh, there he
is!

01:58.418 --> 02:00.086
You should see his
trousers.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.889
<i>They're cut in half and</i>
<i>they're the brightest color</i>
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

02:02.923 --> 02:05.626
I'm getting a pair. My
mother would have a fit.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.294
More later. I miss
you so much...

02:10.496 --> 02:11.932
(Lena)
Jeff!

02:11.965 --> 02:13.033
Hey,
Jeff!

02:13.066 --> 02:17.638
(Jeff) Oh. Hey, Lena. What's
up? How you doing? Yeah.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.173
What's up? Bring it
around, hit it.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.042
Close enough.
-(laughs)

02:22.075 --> 02:25.178
Please tell me what that
arm flailing is. And
why?

02:25.211 --> 02:28.381
Oh, well. This is
down low, over the
rainbow,

02:28.414 --> 02:32.385
quick swing of the rope
followed by a boom boom bam
pow! You know like have a nice
day.

02:32.418 --> 02:34.187
(gasps) Wow, that's
fantastic.

02:34.555 --> 02:38.258
You ready? (Clears
her throat) Check it
out.

02:38.291 --> 02:39.560
(hip-hop music
plays)

02:39.593 --> 02:42.495
Oh. Oh. Oh
man.

02:42.929 --> 02:45.866
Okay, okay. We have a lot
of work to do.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.735
You gotta get current. (Snaps
his fingers)
-I'm getting current.

02:49.469 --> 02:52.606
Erm.. Just watch, just
watch. Ready?

02:52.639 --> 02:57.243
You just feel it with
your shoulders, yeah? Out
on a wave, woooh!

02:57.277 --> 02:59.613
Then we bring it
down to the floor.

03:00.647 --> 03:01.848
Yeah!

03:01.882 --> 03:03.216
Woohoo!

03:03.249 --> 03:07.521
Yes, she moves.
Yeah, okay. Sort
of.

03:09.022 --> 03:14.628
You teach me. I'll teach you.
Don't tell anybody, but my
ballet needs a little work.

03:14.661 --> 03:17.497
Okay, yes, thank
you. I'll go first.

03:18.264 --> 03:19.900
Your pirouette is...
-Awesome?

03:19.933 --> 03:21.902
Not exactly.
-(classical
music)

03:21.935 --> 03:26.507
Imagine a string pulling you
up to the sky, holding your
middle up as well.

03:27.273 --> 03:29.275
Woooooh! Okay. I see
you.

03:31.444 --> 03:32.813
Check
it.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.318
(Lena) There you go. Just
keep your core tight.

03:38.351 --> 03:43.256
Okay, and on that same
note, hip-hop is all about
shredding that string.

03:43.289 --> 03:44.791
(hip-hop
music)

03:44.825 --> 03:49.029
So you just let it go. Feel
your body moving in different
kinds of ways.

03:49.062 --> 03:53.399
Yeah. S... sure. Yeah.
Alright.

03:53.834 --> 03:57.538
I'll walk to class with my
core tight and that string
thing you were talking about,

03:57.571 --> 04:00.674
if you walk to class with
some killer swagger.
-Okay...

04:00.707 --> 04:04.377
Your leg. You just kinda feel
a little limp, you just lean
back. Yeah, there you go.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.813
(Jeff) You know, keep
trying. (phone beeps) Oh!

04:08.348 --> 04:12.819
(gasps) Blok rehearsal
tonight. Wear white. Seven
o'clock.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.655
You ready?
-(Lena)
Yeah!

04:15.021 --> 04:18.925
(coughs)
-Wooohoo! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking
about.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.328
Right? I'm gonna rock the
Blok! Thank you Jeff!!

04:22.362 --> 04:24.030
Oh, well. You're
welcome, Milady.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.666
(Lena
laughs)

04:32.706 --> 04:35.375
(Ines
laughs)

04:36.109 --> 04:39.513
Nice, Lena!
-(all laugh)

04:41.515 --> 04:44.618
(Mr Moreau) Today's
assignment is one of my
favorites.

04:44.651 --> 04:47.821
Each of you will draw a
portrait of your partner.

04:47.854 --> 04:51.592
Then, this afternoon, you
will create and perform a
dance,

04:51.625 --> 04:54.294
based upon their
impression of you.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.830
(Mr Moreau) You two
together.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.866
You and
you.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.502
It's my lucky
day!

05:01.535 --> 05:06.339
Yeah, and my horoscope says
to be wary of boys who keep
showing up uninvited.

05:09.009 --> 05:12.345
(Thea) Hey! What do you think
of that idea I sent you last
night for the Blok?

05:12.378 --> 05:14.881
It's great. We could try it
at rehearsal tonight.

05:15.448 --> 05:17.450
And that's why we're
the power couple.

05:20.621 --> 05:23.890
I need some of those
ear thingies.
-Hm? What's that now?

05:25.125 --> 05:29.530
I totally stand out. I haven't
seen anything, or been
anywhere!

05:29.563 --> 05:34.134
You're a princess. Don't you
guys travel the world as part
of your whole existence?

05:34.167 --> 05:36.036
Oh, I was very
sheltered.

05:45.445 --> 05:49.082
(ticking and
magical tinkling
noises)

06:07.834 --> 06:10.470
(Oscar) Rise and
shine!
-Where am I?

06:10.504 --> 06:14.074
Oscar, time travel, Lena. Am I
still one year behind Lena?

06:14.641 --> 06:17.611
Yes. You didn't travel
anywhere while you
slept.

06:19.513 --> 06:23.083
How many portal periods
are there?

06:23.116 --> 06:24.518
Erm...

06:24.551 --> 06:26.953
Three! I was just going to
say that.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.089
You have to take this
seriously!

06:42.703 --> 06:44.638
Why do you never leave the
shop?

06:44.671 --> 06:47.007
Because inside
here, time stands
still.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.009
So I don't
age.

06:49.475 --> 06:51.444
Do you really expect
me to believe that?

06:51.477 --> 06:54.114
No. No one
does.

06:55.048 --> 06:58.852
The book says timepieces
have been in families for
generations.

06:58.885 --> 07:01.822
And they each have
a kind of
signature.

07:01.855 --> 07:02.956
Yeah. That's
right.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.891
Hm.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.260
(Henri) Hey, what's
that?

07:07.293 --> 07:11.064
Oh, well, that? Your father
left this for you.

07:11.097 --> 07:16.436
Ages ago, in case of
emergency, only.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.004
No!
-Ow!

07:19.339 --> 07:22.776
I've time traveled into the
future to rescue my
girlfriend,

07:22.809 --> 07:24.978
and now she is one
year ahead of me.

07:25.011 --> 07:27.781
I would like to officially
declare this as an
emergency!

07:27.814 --> 07:30.050
I'm not gonna fall
for that old
chestnut.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.220
It says you're the
village clerk?

07:34.254 --> 07:38.892
Yes, I keep records of time
travel, help travelers.

07:38.925 --> 07:41.562
I keep a log of all the
time travel tales.

07:41.595 --> 07:45.899
Obviously you've seen
hundreds of "red emergency
boxes".

07:46.733 --> 07:48.168
No, I... I
haven't.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.539
Okay. Woh...
just...

07:53.139 --> 07:54.841
We will just have a
peek.

07:59.580 --> 08:04.117
(Oscar) Wow, this is
legendary! I've only ever
heard about these.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.588
(gasps) Oh, man. I
can't believe this.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.858
You know you can only travel
at certain times, when the
portals are open.

08:12.258 --> 08:15.128
Well, this piece is
special.

08:15.161 --> 08:21.535
This piece allows you to
complete one jump through time
during a non-portal period.

08:22.803 --> 08:26.039
You can travel any
time you want with
this guy.

08:26.072 --> 08:29.142
I mean, you could travel
right now, if you wanted
to.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.045
But the rules.
One.

08:32.813 --> 08:38.752
There are three portal
periods. Travel is only
allowed during these times.

08:38.785 --> 08:42.556
No exceptions. Except with a
piece like this.

08:42.589 --> 08:46.259
But hang on, hang on. A non
portal jump has
repercussions.

08:46.292 --> 08:50.030
You can't just run amok
with this powerful piece of
machinery.

08:50.063 --> 08:54.100
Let's just review the Do's
and the Don'ts and the...
DON'T!

08:58.071 --> 09:01.908
(ticking and
magical tinkling
noises)

09:09.015 --> 09:12.853
(Mr Moreau) Now for the
exciting part. Time to reveal
your piece to your partners.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.824
(Dash) Wow! Who's that
handsome guy?

09:23.263 --> 09:26.199
(Ines) What's that supposed
to mean?
-Well...

09:26.232 --> 09:30.370
No one really knows you,
cause you know how you
are.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.906
No. How exactly am I?

09:32.939 --> 09:35.742
You know... you don't really
let people in.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.612
It's your thing. You
know that, right?

09:38.645 --> 09:42.716
So, you're kinda
like a blank
page.

09:45.218 --> 09:48.121
Oh come on, I'm only
joking.

09:48.154 --> 09:49.723
It's not
funny.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.599
(laughing)

09:59.132 --> 10:02.068
(Jeff) Okay. Check it
out.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.707
You think that's what I
look like?
-Yeah.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.810
You're all proper and
old timey, you know.

10:09.843 --> 10:13.279
Oh, right. I am old
timey.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.150
I need to get
current.

10:18.184 --> 10:21.354
Let's go out during
rehearsal! We can rehearse
out in the real world.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.424
(Lena) I need to see
it. I need to feel it.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.793
Aren't they mad
serious about the
rules here?

10:26.827 --> 10:29.262
But you said hip-hop was
about breaking the rules.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.365
Consider this a
field assignment.
-Okay.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.668
This is going to be
sickening.
-Sick.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.672
Didn't I just say that?
-No.

10:38.705 --> 10:40.373
(hip-hop music
plays)

10:49.049 --> 10:51.317
This is
amazing.

10:52.285 --> 10:59.325
The people, the music. It's
so alive. And colorful. And
loud. Really loud.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.427
Hear that
beat?

11:01.461 --> 11:04.698
Yo, let's rehearse our piece
for class. Check it!

11:04.731 --> 11:07.668
(Jeff emits popping
sounds)

11:11.505 --> 11:14.007
(Lena
laughs)

11:22.949 --> 11:26.252
(Lena) Wow. I wish I could
dance like you.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.188
You know, even though
you drew me as old
timey,

11:28.221 --> 11:30.090
I'm gonna get
current for this
assignment!

11:30.123 --> 11:33.894
You go, L. You rock
that swagger.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.166
(whooshing sound, beating
heart)

11:45.906 --> 11:46.973
(whooshing
sound)

11:47.007 --> 11:48.408
Whoa, you
okay?

11:49.375 --> 11:53.013
Yeah. I thought I felt
something.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.348
I must just be imagining
things. (Giggles)

12:01.988 --> 12:03.389
You're still
mad.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.226
I thought I was a blank page.
Blank pages can't get mad,
remember?

12:06.259 --> 12:10.130
Ines, I was just kidding. I
thought it would make you
laugh.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.698
Got it.
-Got it, you're all
good?

12:11.732 --> 12:16.236
Or got it, your eyes are
shooting daggers at me right
now?
-The second one.

12:17.303 --> 12:18.371
Got
it.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.341
(Lena) Did you see what
everyone's wearing?

12:22.342 --> 12:28.248
Who dreams up these miracles?
Reminds me of the World's Fair
in 1900.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.951
The who's coming out of
the what, now?
-(Lena giggles)

12:30.984 --> 12:33.486
Did you seriously just
say the 1900 World's
Fair?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.455
(chuckles) I was just
joking, silly.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.358
(chuckles) Okay, cause
that would be bonkers,
yo.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.226
(Lena) Totally bonkers.
Yo.

12:43.864 --> 12:48.001
Oh man. Ines is looking for
us. Uh, class is starting
soon, L.

12:49.570 --> 12:50.837
L?

12:54.407 --> 12:56.076
Oh
no.

13:01.414 --> 13:06.186
(dramatic music, beating
heart)

13:09.455 --> 13:10.557
Oh...

13:13.093 --> 13:14.160
Oh.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.762
Yo. We gotta
go!

13:15.796 --> 13:20.300
Check out this current!
-No, fail. That's like, for my
grandmother.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.970
Okay, now let's roll.
Remember? Mad serious about
the rules?

13:25.038 --> 13:29.242
(whooshing sound, beating
heart)

13:35.081 --> 13:37.250
(whooshing
sound)

13:38.018 --> 13:39.319
Did you feel
that?

13:39.352 --> 13:40.687
My heart
palpitating because
I lost you

13:40.721 --> 13:43.289
and I'm feeling panicked that
we're not running back to
class?

13:43.323 --> 13:45.892
Yeah, I feel
that.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.929
You know that feeling when
the hairs stand up on the
back of your neck?

13:48.962 --> 13:50.063
We call it the
jeebies.

13:50.096 --> 13:53.133
It's the "let's get back
to class" jeebies. Come
on!

13:53.166 --> 13:54.635
Wait! One more
thing.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.469
I'm not sure you can
carry one more thing.

13:56.970 --> 14:01.041
This card is magical. You
tap it and the item is
yours.

14:01.441 --> 14:05.646
Okay. I officially declare
you done. Let's go!

14:05.679 --> 14:09.282
(beatboxing in the
background) Oh... What is
this again?

14:09.315 --> 14:11.217
Beatboxing.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.586
I like
it.

14:13.587 --> 14:15.956
Okay. I'm ready. (Phone
rings)

14:17.591 --> 14:19.192
Where are you?
Class is
starting.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.332
(piano plays classical
piece)

15:35.636 --> 15:37.704
That's totally
amazing.

15:37.738 --> 15:39.472
(all
applaud)

15:41.141 --> 15:43.577
(Etienne) Nice, Ines, very
passionate.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.714
Well, well, well...
thank you for joining
us.

15:47.748 --> 15:50.250
Oh, it's our pleasure,
sir. Truly.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.221
Detention.
-Fantastic...

15:55.789 --> 15:59.092
You're gonna take yourself and
your shopping packages and go
see Ms Carré, now.

16:01.027 --> 16:04.665
Sir. Please. I've had
a wonderful day. I was
so inspired!

16:05.265 --> 16:07.400
Erm, you see... (rustling
bag)

16:09.169 --> 16:11.337
I need to change
this.

16:11.371 --> 16:12.539
(students
laugh)

16:14.007 --> 16:19.245
Erm. If you'd allow me, I'd
like to show you what I've
learned today.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.648
Please.
(Sighs)

16:26.653 --> 16:29.189
(piano plays classical
piece)

16:58.519 --> 17:00.386
(Jeff
beatboxes)

17:18.171 --> 17:20.206
(students cheer and
applaud)

17:22.676 --> 17:26.379
(Etienne) Funny. But you
both still have
detention.

17:27.548 --> 17:30.083
I'm confused. Isn't that
good?

17:30.116 --> 17:32.485
No. It's
punishment.

17:33.620 --> 17:37.591
Oh, don't punish Jeff
please. This was my fault.

17:40.326 --> 17:41.528
Fine.

17:41.562 --> 17:43.496
But if anything like
this happens again,

17:43.530 --> 17:46.266
you'll be in detention for
the rest of your time at this
school.

18:01.515 --> 18:05.652
To the future! Another
future. The future that Lena
is in!

18:12.258 --> 18:14.828
(whooshing and laser
sounds)

18:26.507 --> 18:29.643
Excuse me sir, is
this the year 1905?

18:30.243 --> 18:31.311
Bah,
oui!

18:34.781 --> 18:37.417
I'm a hundred
years away from
her...

18:42.889 --> 18:44.457
I get it. You're
mad.

18:44.490 --> 18:45.759
More.
-Furious.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.528
Get out your
thesaurus.
-Why?

18:47.561 --> 18:51.464
Because you haven't come up
with nearly enough words to
describe how angry I really am.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.867
I didn't mean to hurt
your feelings.
Annihilate.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.268
I thought we were
flirting.
-Preposterous.

18:55.301 --> 18:58.572
I thought you would think
that it was cute. Or that I
was cute.

18:58.605 --> 19:02.208
Misinformed.
Counterfactual. Delusional.
Erroneous!

19:03.677 --> 19:05.746
Yikes. Need a
dictionary?

19:05.779 --> 19:10.350
Ugh... Yeah... Yes I
do.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.519
Hmm.

19:23.229 --> 19:28.234
Oh no! You can't be here and
in the future at the same
time.

19:28.268 --> 19:31.437
Can you? And you look exactly
the same.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.341
Am I... Am I
dreaming?

19:35.676 --> 19:36.810
Can I help
you?

19:36.843 --> 19:37.911
Oscar, it's
me.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.713
Pleased to meet you,
Me.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.347
You must be
joking.

19:41.381 --> 19:45.752
We just met... a hundred
years in the future!

19:45.786 --> 19:49.489
You've taken a real liking
to me. Here's a photo to
prove it.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.893
How do I know you're not
lying?
-Oh, I'm not.

19:52.926 --> 19:56.863
Actually I just ran off with an
emergency timepiece right
before your eyes

19:56.897 --> 20:01.835
in the hope I would get
to Lena but I landed in
1905.

20:01.868 --> 20:06.472
So, instead of going to the
future, you ricocheted back to
the past?

20:06.840 --> 20:07.941
Yes.

20:07.974 --> 20:11.411
Wow. There must be a bubble
then.

20:12.713 --> 20:14.615
There's a timepiece
that has that
capability

20:14.648 --> 20:17.851
but there's no way you
could possibly have it,
could you?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.520
Well... I gave
it to my
girlfriend.

20:19.553 --> 20:21.287
You gave it to your
girlfriend?

20:21.622 --> 20:23.223
I didn't know
anything about a
bubble.

20:23.624 --> 20:26.660
I gave her instructions,
that I found in a
journal.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.128
To remove her from
danger.

20:28.161 --> 20:34.801
Wow... Not good. You put
your girl in a bubble with
those instructions.

20:34.835 --> 20:35.869
No one can get to her
now.

20:36.637 --> 20:40.607
But I need to get her. This
whole thing is my fault!

20:40.974 --> 20:44.745
Oh no... You need to
leave.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.014
You've caused a ripple
effect. A time rip.

20:49.049 --> 20:50.551
I can't be associated with you.
-Whoa.

20:50.584 --> 20:55.488
I don't even know what
that means!
-Nobody does.
But you have to go!

21:17.878 --> 21:20.814
Henri, you will never
believe what I did today.

21:20.847 --> 21:24.918
I got my first detention.
Well, which isn't so
good.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.688
But, I did go out and see the
modern world and it's
amazing.

21:49.543 --> 21:51.411
Yo, check this
out!

21:52.445 --> 21:53.980
Moves for the
Blok.

22:14.935 --> 22:19.039
(Jeff) Welcome to the Garnier
tunnels, Milady. It's Blok
time!

22:19.072 --> 22:23.710
(Lena) About earlier, that
was really nice of you. Thank
you, Jeff.

22:23.744 --> 22:27.981
Hey, I couldn't let you take
the fall yourself. Least I
could do.

22:28.014 --> 22:31.417
And I did go out with
you willingly so...

22:31.451 --> 22:33.620
Thank you Lady L.
-(Lena laughs)

22:34.588 --> 22:38.024
(Jeff) Hey, man!
-Yo! What's up?

22:47.768 --> 22:52.739
Oh Lena. I've just come from
the future and I can assure
you, it's full of danger.

22:52.773 --> 22:56.076
But, it's also kind of
exciting.

22:56.109 --> 23:03.617
But some other things happened
that I need to tell you. First
off, I'm back in 1905...

23:14.194 --> 23:17.463
(pop music
plays)

24:33.006 --> 24:35.942
(all)
Wooooh!!!

24:39.646 --> 24:43.850
(Jeff) Check it out!
That's next level to...
Aw!

24:45.919 --> 24:48.789
OK, so
this...

24:48.822 --> 24:51.525
is "I'm sorry for getting
you into trouble".

24:51.558 --> 24:56.029
Followed by a "thank
you for showing me
outside".

24:56.062 --> 24:58.965
With a little bit
of a boop boop
boop,

24:58.999 --> 25:03.570
which is basically a secret
code for "thanks for the
detention dancing".

25:03.604 --> 25:06.206
(laughs) Crazy
girl.

25:07.741 --> 25:09.242
Just spit it
out.

25:21.254 --> 25:22.656
Wow...

25:24.324 --> 25:26.593
That's how I see
you.

25:36.603 --> 25:40.340
(Thea) We should totally show
this to some underground dance
crew.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.609
That's not what the Blok
is.

25:42.643 --> 25:45.779
We could go viral on the
underground dance scene.

25:45.812 --> 25:48.014
Nobody would have
to know who we
are.

25:49.315 --> 25:53.219
The Blok is just for us, you
know that, babe. (Kisses
her)

25:57.090 --> 25:58.124
We'll see about
that.

25:58.158 --> 26:02.195
(Jeff sings) And we're
shopping, we're shopping.

26:03.063 --> 26:06.066
We're shopping. Ah,
ah. We're shopping.

26:06.099 --> 26:10.236
Now we're running, we're
running. Yeah, yeah!
We're running.

26:10.270 --> 26:11.337
(Jeff) Now we're
late!

26:14.808 --> 26:20.013
(Jeff) We're out of time.
We're out of time. Out of
time!
