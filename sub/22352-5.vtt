WEBVTT

00:30.405 --> 00:32.615
[woman groans] God! Oh, my God!

00:33.742 --> 00:35.118
[sighs and groans]

00:36.077 --> 00:37.662
[chuckles]

00:37.746 --> 00:39.080
Tal, what's going on?

00:39.164 --> 00:42.167
They want me to build these tents
for tonight's campout under the stars,

00:42.250 --> 00:44.252
except I don't know
how these things work.

00:44.335 --> 00:48.214
- Like, where does this even go?
- Yeah, you're building that wrong. Um...

00:48.298 --> 00:52.260
That pole is for the other arch
of the dome.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.763
Noah, you're in the middle
of something yourself.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.931
It's fine. I'll figure it out.

00:57.015 --> 01:00.894
I mean, I've got to build, like,
21 birdhouse kits for tomorrow.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.480
I'm sure I can spare a couple minutes.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.648
- I didn't know you were so handy.
- Oh, yeah.

01:05.732 --> 01:10.528
I don't like to brag but I am a lean,
mean, birdhouse building machine.

01:10.612 --> 01:13.490
A guy who can build things
with his own two hands

01:13.573 --> 01:16.576
speaks to the caveman and woman in us all.

01:16.659 --> 01:17.869
[both chuckle]

01:19.871 --> 01:22.957
- Shit, is that the actual time?
- Uh, yeah, why? What's wrong?

01:23.041 --> 01:25.919
[groans] I'm supposed to lead
a nature walk in, like, five minutes.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.462
You couldn't--

01:28.129 --> 01:29.756
You know what? Forget it.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.674
It's not your fault
that I'm brain dead today.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.093
- Oh, no, you want me to get started?
- Please?

01:34.177 --> 01:37.430
- Please, would you? You'd be a lifesaver.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.433
You go lead the nature walk and
I'll, uh, I'll get busy with the poles.

01:41.017 --> 01:41.851
Thank you.

01:42.685 --> 01:43.686
You're a lifesaver.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.938
Hey, I mean...

01:45.021 --> 01:46.940
I am half-man, half-amazing.

01:47.023 --> 01:47.941
[laughs]

01:48.024 --> 01:49.734
You are amazing.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.612
I promise I'll make it up to you.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.493
Thank you! Thank you!

01:58.576 --> 02:00.203
That's...

02:00.286 --> 02:01.287
That's a nice start.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.132
Ladies, who has the beer?

02:13.383 --> 02:16.302
Can I have one, please?
'Cause now I have the day off.

02:19.180 --> 02:23.893
♪ The other day, the other day
I saw a bear, I saw a bear ♪

02:23.977 --> 02:26.187
♪ A great big bear, a great big... ♪

02:39.325 --> 02:41.661
Thought you were spending the afternoon
building birdhouses.

02:41.744 --> 02:45.039
[chuckles] Yeah, I will,
once I'm done with all this.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.875
Talvinder needed my help.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.795
Man, they should, like, really teach
new counselors how to start fires

02:50.879 --> 02:53.339
- and set up tents and stuff.
- They do. It's called orientation.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.050
- [Peter chuckles]
- Yeah, fair play. Hey, hold this.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.013
You know, it's just like-- it's like
a chess match, my friend.

03:00.096 --> 03:03.808
I make a move, Talvinder makes hers.
I counter.

03:03.892 --> 03:07.312
She counters my counter.
I counter her counter that she countered.

03:07.395 --> 03:13.234
Until finally, king corners queen,
a checkmate of love.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.237
You need to get your eyes checked.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.948
Why would I need to get my eyes checked?

03:19.032 --> 03:21.743
Because you're the only one who sees
anything happening with Talvinder.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.455
Look, I'm just saying,
I know you're into her and everything

03:26.205 --> 03:27.916
but I do not see it coming back.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.543
Maybe you're the one that needs
to get their eyes checked

03:30.627 --> 03:33.755
because I'm seeing perfectly clear.
I'm seeing 20/20.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.506
I'm seeing better than 20/20.

03:35.590 --> 03:40.261
I'm seeing like 20/30 or 30/20,
whatever one is better. I don't know.

03:40.970 --> 03:44.891
Okay. I'm just saying that maybe you
should take a long, hard look at reality

03:46.267 --> 03:47.268
and move on.

03:54.984 --> 03:55.985
[scoffs]

03:56.069 --> 03:57.028
Move on.

03:58.821 --> 04:01.366
I'm gonna move on Talvinder,
that's what I'm gonna do.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.544
[panting]

04:19.384 --> 04:21.261
[panting]

04:37.652 --> 04:39.153
[wincing]

05:15.648 --> 05:17.025
[grunts]

05:17.108 --> 05:20.361
You motherfucker, you were trying
to mash my skull, weren't you?

05:21.029 --> 05:23.114
- I guess we're not done playing yet, huh?
- No!

05:23.197 --> 05:25.033
Wanna play some more? Scream for me.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.117
- [screams]
- Huh?

05:26.200 --> 05:28.161
Scream for me, you little bitch!
That's all you got?

05:28.244 --> 05:29.954
Now scream! [laughing]

05:30.038 --> 05:31.831
[screaming]

05:40.048 --> 05:42.717
[wind whistling]

05:46.054 --> 05:48.347
- [man] Do you have any idea who this is?
- [woman, panting] No.

05:49.223 --> 05:51.059
[door thudding]

05:52.477 --> 05:53.352
Okay.

05:54.937 --> 05:55.897
Take this.

05:56.731 --> 05:57.648
What are you doing?

05:58.274 --> 06:00.068
Looking for breath mints.
What do you think?

06:00.985 --> 06:02.403
Oh, shit.

06:03.112 --> 06:04.113
[groans] Okay.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.698
Okay, okay.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.493
[shudders]

06:26.260 --> 06:27.845
Renee gave me this book to read.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.561
Peter.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.146
- Peter!
- What?

06:43.903 --> 06:45.154
Son of a bitch.

06:45.947 --> 06:46.781
Shit.

06:49.700 --> 06:50.576
You know, Noah,

06:53.663 --> 06:55.289
all those people back at the house,

06:57.834 --> 06:59.627
[deep breath]

06:59.710 --> 07:02.338
all they do is talk
and talk and talk and talk,

07:02.421 --> 07:04.382
and they just don't shut up.

07:04.465 --> 07:07.718
[chuckles] Do you have any idea
how much I wanted to snap Renee's neck?

07:09.554 --> 07:11.597
And Antoine, fuck, I hated him.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.602
And that wacky bitch Judith...
[laughs] with her fucking crystals

07:16.686 --> 07:18.980
and her disgusting carob muffins.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.481
God, I hated those!

07:22.066 --> 07:23.568
You know, my plan,

07:24.277 --> 07:26.654
I was just gonna wait out the winter,
that's all.

07:26.737 --> 07:30.616
I was gonna wait out the winter.
The snow melts and I was gonna split.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.369
Nobody had to get hurt.

07:36.831 --> 07:37.748
I hated them.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.044
But I liked you, Noah.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.049
I always did. I liked you.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.346
I'm really sorry, buddy.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.315
[drips echoing in bowl]

08:28.925 --> 08:30.343
It was a senseless death.

08:30.426 --> 08:31.260
[exhales]

08:36.849 --> 08:40.561
All she wanted to do was help everybody
get out of here safe and sound.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.897
This all started
when we let those outsiders in.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.983
I told you that first day
it was dangerous, but...

08:48.069 --> 08:49.862
now we've opened Pandora's box.

08:50.780 --> 08:51.781
Who's next, huh?

08:54.283 --> 08:56.994
Wren, listen to me.

08:57.954 --> 09:01.332
I don't want you to talk like that
in front of the others. You'll scare them.

09:01.999 --> 09:04.502
You don't want to make them afraid.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.137
[Renee]  It was white baneberry.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.848
It's also known as doll's eyes.
It's poisonous.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.434
Megan's bowl was full of them.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.937
Okay, do I look like someone who knows
anything about plants?

09:23.020 --> 09:23.854
You were a camp counselor.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.231
- You would've learned--
- I've forgotten it all.

09:25.314 --> 09:27.483
Just like I've forgotten everything
I've ever learned in undergrad

09:27.567 --> 09:29.777
or how to parallel park a car.

09:29.860 --> 09:30.778
Dawn...

09:32.488 --> 09:35.116
You have to understand
why this seems suspicious to us.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.286
Okay. But Antoine was the one
who went out in the woods

09:38.369 --> 09:41.330
and picked a handful
of poisonous berries, right? Not me.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.375
I did not kill Megan.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.506
I didn't kill her.

09:53.009 --> 09:56.053
- Glenn is not Glenn.
- What?

09:56.137 --> 09:58.848
The real Glenn is shoved in a freezer
in the back of that Winnebago.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.475
The person you've been calling Glenn
this whole time is the killer.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.936
You have proof of that?
That-- That's fuckin' convenient.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.480
Look, I understand
that you might not believe this right now

10:06.564 --> 10:08.816
but Keira and I saw it with our own eyes.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.861
Look, this guy has Noah
and we need to find them.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.405
How do we know the actual killer
didn't kill this guy and pin it on Glenn?

10:14.488 --> 10:15.865
One of us is gonna be next.

10:15.948 --> 10:19.660
I don't know how much good,
if any, I can do out in that storm.

10:19.744 --> 10:20.828
[Peter] We can't all go.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.997
A couple of us need to stay
and lock down the house.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.583
Renee can stay with you, Judith.
She's had a really rough day.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.753
- Here, I'm gonna leave you the gun.
- I don't know anything about guns.

10:28.836 --> 10:29.795
Just point and shoot.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.005
[shudders]

10:31.088 --> 10:32.465
I don't know if I can.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.717
I know you guys
could probably use me out there

10:34.800 --> 10:36.761
but I don't like the thought of these guys
staying here all alone.

10:36.844 --> 10:39.847
- Maybe I should stay.
- No, you go. I've got this with Judith.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.391
You've got to be able
to defend yourself now.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.937
- Can I hold it?
- Give her the gun.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.524
Sure. Here.

10:53.819 --> 10:54.862
There you go.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.908
You go, Keira. It's okay.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.118
I'll be okay.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.621
Go find him.

11:04.747 --> 11:07.708
- Come on out.
- [Noah] No, no, no.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.502
- No, no.
- [Glenn] It's all right.

11:09.585 --> 11:10.753
- No.
- Don't make a fuss.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.004
- No!
- It's okay.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.173
[groaning and panting]

11:15.966 --> 11:17.593
[grunting]

11:17.676 --> 11:19.345
[gagging]

11:22.056 --> 11:23.474
- [grunting]
- [wheezing]

11:25.393 --> 11:28.354
- [grunting]
- [wheezing and gasping]

11:28.437 --> 11:29.355
[Glenn] Motherfucker!

11:29.438 --> 11:31.482
[grunting]

11:33.401 --> 11:34.568
You son of a bitch!

11:38.781 --> 11:40.574
[gasping]

11:53.003 --> 11:54.046
Fuck!

12:00.636 --> 12:02.304
[grunting]

12:05.391 --> 12:06.392
Noah!

12:08.352 --> 12:09.228
Noah!

12:12.231 --> 12:13.858
Where are you, you little petulant prick?

12:18.737 --> 12:21.282
[woman] You lied, Talvinder. You cheated.

12:22.032 --> 12:26.328
You manipulated all of us
just so you could get what you wanted.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.581
- I'm sorry.
- [woman 2] Sorry for what?

12:30.124 --> 12:33.169
For all the shit you did
or for getting caught?

12:33.252 --> 12:35.463
You didn't know it was wrong
to seduce Andi's boyfriend?

12:36.881 --> 12:39.633
You didn't think about her at all
when you let Peter fuck you, did you?

12:39.717 --> 12:40.801
- [Peter] Dawn, pull it back.
- [Talvinder] No.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.012
Are you seriously defending her right now?

12:43.929 --> 12:44.847
[Susan] You've been tried.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.224
Now it's time for your punishment.

12:48.392 --> 12:49.310
I'm sorry. What?

12:50.478 --> 12:54.231
You didn't think you would just get away
with a stern talking to, did you?

12:54.315 --> 12:56.775
A slut and naïve. Wow.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.194
[Susan] You see, we...

12:59.069 --> 13:03.199
your  former  friends,
hereby sentence you to a night alone,

13:04.241 --> 13:08.370
out here in the middle of nowhere
with nothing but the clothes on your back.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.081
- [Peter] Wait. I did not agree to that.
- Well, we did.

13:11.874 --> 13:16.003
That way, Tal can sit here and think
long and hard about what she's done.

13:16.086 --> 13:16.921
[Talvinder] You're joking, right?

13:17.004 --> 13:18.839
It's fucking freezing.
I'll freeze to death.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.174
[Andi] Yeah.

13:20.257 --> 13:22.843
It'll be pretty uncomfortable sleeping.
That's gonna be tough.

13:25.763 --> 13:29.975
Noah, Noah, please, please,
you can't make me stay here by myself.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.645
You know I'm not the person
they're accusing me of being.

13:32.728 --> 13:33.687
You know that, Noah.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.190
[mocking] "Noah, please,
you can't leave me here."

13:36.273 --> 13:37.149
[scoffs] Please.

13:38.526 --> 13:39.360
Enough.

13:40.694 --> 13:42.112
I've been the only one

13:43.447 --> 13:46.450
who sticks up for you over
and over and over,

13:47.076 --> 13:47.910
and I'm done.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.080
You-- You've hurt people, Talvinder

13:52.081 --> 13:56.168
and this is your own special prize,
just for you.

13:57.628 --> 14:01.715
All in favor of Talvinder
spending the night here alone.

14:06.929 --> 14:07.888
No.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.474
You guys are kidding, right?

14:13.102 --> 14:15.104
Wait! You guys can't leave me here!

14:16.939 --> 14:17.940
Wait!

14:19.859 --> 14:22.278
- [Peter] Noah!
- Noah, where are you?

14:22.653 --> 14:23.904
Noah!

14:26.448 --> 14:27.366
What the hell is that?

14:27.449 --> 14:29.410
[Mark] Noah, are you there?

14:29.493 --> 14:32.705
[Peter] Noah! If you can hear me,
call out to my voice!

14:34.707 --> 14:36.292
Help!

14:36.375 --> 14:37.835
Help me!

14:39.253 --> 14:41.297
- [Peter] Noah!
- Help me!

14:41.380 --> 14:43.090
[gasping]

14:43.173 --> 14:44.174
- Noah!
- Noah!

14:47.177 --> 14:49.388
- [Keira] Noah!
- [weakly] Help! Help me!

14:50.264 --> 14:51.682
Pull him up. Pull him up!

14:57.396 --> 14:58.856
[Wren] That wind's really picking up.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.318
The storm's not stopping any time soon.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.279
They should have been back by now.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.072
Well, maybe they found Noah.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.241
[Renee] Maybe they've been ambushed.

15:09.950 --> 15:10.826
Maybe they're all dead.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.286
Maybe we're just gonna be
waiting here until--

15:12.369 --> 15:13.662
- [distant thud]
- [gasps]

15:16.582 --> 15:17.583
[sighs]

15:18.626 --> 15:19.585
It's the wind.

15:20.544 --> 15:21.629
It's just the wind.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.966
Yeah, I think I'd better check on that.

15:26.550 --> 15:27.676
Do you want the gun?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.053
No.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.304
[door opens]

15:31.388 --> 15:33.349
- [Renee] I can't.
- [door closes]

15:33.432 --> 15:35.351
I can't do this.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.811
We shouldn't have split up.
We should have stayed together.

15:37.895 --> 15:41.190
- I'm sure that they are--
- What are you sure of, Judith?

15:53.577 --> 15:55.037
I'm not sure of anything anymore,

15:57.665 --> 15:59.750
except I'm tired of being alone.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.463
I'm tired of being afraid.

16:07.633 --> 16:11.637
Antoine was always so sure,
even when he shouldn't have been.

16:14.974 --> 16:15.975
Where is he now?

16:17.601 --> 16:18.644
Renee...

16:24.858 --> 16:26.360
Everything's gonna be fine.

16:35.869 --> 16:37.079
Promise?

16:38.163 --> 16:39.164
I promise.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.836
[screaming]

16:44.920 --> 16:47.131
Wren! Wren!

16:47.214 --> 16:48.757
[grunting]

16:48.841 --> 16:50.718
Wren! Wren!

16:51.552 --> 16:54.388
- [cackling]
- [gagging]

16:58.100 --> 16:59.727
- Wren!
- [grunts]

16:59.810 --> 17:01.270
- [panting]
- [screams]

17:04.106 --> 17:06.608
One vegan bitch down, one to go.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.611
[muffled panting]

17:54.406 --> 17:56.867
- Aaah!
- [gasps]

17:56.950 --> 17:59.787
You know I can hear
all that yoga fuckin' breathing?

17:59.870 --> 18:00.704
No.

18:00.788 --> 18:04.041
That pranayama bullshit,
you sound like a fuckin' freight train!

18:04.666 --> 18:05.667
Don't do this.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.129
You think I wanna do this?

18:10.589 --> 18:11.924
No, I don't want to do this.

18:12.549 --> 18:15.010
It was that little fuckin' twink
who fucked everything up.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.137
Judy...

18:18.555 --> 18:19.640
- I like you.
- [groans]

18:19.723 --> 18:22.142
Maybe we'll get to meet in another life.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.393
[shudders]

18:24.520 --> 18:27.064
[groaning and wincing]

18:28.273 --> 18:29.691
You fuckin' bitch!

18:30.818 --> 18:33.070
- Say that again, you psycho fuck!
- Don't, Renee!

18:33.153 --> 18:34.488
Don't kill him! Don't kill him!

18:34.571 --> 18:39.159
I won't, not yet. Not until this asshole
tells me why he killed Antoine!

18:39.743 --> 18:42.329
- Fuck you!
- Shut the fuck up!

18:45.541 --> 18:47.960
[wind gusting]

19:02.558 --> 19:07.020
Keira will be here in a minute,
so why don't you sit down?

19:11.608 --> 19:13.694
I don't, I don't think I can.

19:16.780 --> 19:17.781
[sobs]

19:20.242 --> 19:21.368
You know, the whole time...

19:24.413 --> 19:27.916
I thought if-- if it was like a TV show,

19:32.254 --> 19:34.047
you know, the cops would come,

19:37.092 --> 19:38.135
someone would, like,

19:40.888 --> 19:43.390
[sobs] kick down the door to save me.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.316
[sighs] But they never did save me.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.324
[sniffles]

20:20.344 --> 20:21.929
[door creaking]

20:29.603 --> 20:30.604
Keira?

20:37.361 --> 20:38.362
Who is it?

20:42.366 --> 20:44.701
[grunts] Hey, who's there?

20:46.536 --> 20:47.621
Don't fuck around. Who is it?

20:50.082 --> 20:51.083
Who is it?

20:53.585 --> 20:55.462
Who is it? Stop fucking with me!

20:57.381 --> 21:00.342
- I'm not Keira.
- [shudders] Jesus Christ.

21:02.010 --> 21:05.013
[panting] Son of a bitch!

21:05.097 --> 21:08.058
You got me tied to a fuckin' chair,
facing away from the door,

21:08.141 --> 21:10.978
and you sneak up on me?
You think that's funny? It ain't!

21:20.112 --> 21:21.780
Am I supposed to eat that with my eyes?

21:31.248 --> 21:32.749
There's no fuckin' meat!

21:33.333 --> 21:34.167
Water.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.383
- Water?
-Yeah, I want water.

21:41.466 --> 21:44.886
This is fuckin' sawdust.
Renee made that, didn't she? Fuck.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.270
Ah. [sighs]

21:59.276 --> 22:01.153
Now maybe you'll answer some questions.

22:01.903 --> 22:04.197
The gasoline you siphoned
from the snowmobiles,

22:05.782 --> 22:07.367
- where is it?
- [scoffs]

22:07.451 --> 22:09.494
You don't think
if I could hop on a snowmobile

22:09.578 --> 22:11.997
and get the fuck out of Dodge,
I would have by now?

22:13.707 --> 22:15.334
Did you poison any more of our food?

22:16.376 --> 22:17.461
Poisoned?

22:20.047 --> 22:21.465
Who was poisoned?

22:24.092 --> 22:25.677
Do you have any accomplices?

22:26.261 --> 22:28.138
I'm not a killer.

22:29.097 --> 22:30.098
Except for Glenn.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.727
I mean, the real Glenn.

22:36.104 --> 22:37.522
Which means that you are...

22:38.815 --> 22:40.484
Benny Ironside, is that right?

22:45.155 --> 22:46.114
Well, Benny,

22:47.866 --> 22:51.161
I'm no doctor but I'm pretty sure

22:52.788 --> 22:56.124
that you're overdue for one of these,
and that can't be good.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.753
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.

23:01.588 --> 23:02.714
Do you have an accomplice?

23:08.178 --> 23:09.846
Killing Glenn wasn't planned.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.975
It was an accident.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.269
That's the truth.

23:21.024 --> 23:22.609
Now you're just wasting my time.

23:23.860 --> 23:27.030
I pretended I was Glenn
because I needed to lay low.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.991
So, why would I screw that up?

23:30.075 --> 23:31.660
What the hell would the point be?

23:32.619 --> 23:34.871
Serial killers get off on power.

23:36.081 --> 23:39.543
Sadism is a big part of what they do.
We saw what you did to Noah.

23:39.626 --> 23:43.588
I am not a serial killer!
All right? I don't kill for fun.

23:43.672 --> 23:47.217
If I did, why the hell would I wait
so long whacking you people?

23:48.218 --> 23:49.636
If I was a fuckin' serial killer,

23:49.719 --> 23:51.888
I would have killed all you motherfuckers
on day one!

23:51.972 --> 23:53.974
Boom, boom, boom! Done!

23:56.393 --> 23:57.811
Think about this, man.

23:58.645 --> 24:01.398
None of this started until they showed up
and you know that.

24:02.899 --> 24:03.900
You know I'm right.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.154
[panting]

24:13.243 --> 24:14.911
[groans]

24:23.461 --> 24:24.588
Oh.

24:26.423 --> 24:27.507
That looks like it hurts.

24:30.343 --> 24:32.262
Glenn caught me by surprise.
I, uh...

24:33.471 --> 24:34.472
I heard you calling.

24:36.766 --> 24:37.851
Let me help.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.491
I'm sorry.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.371
No.

24:59.372 --> 25:00.582
You're not made of stone.

25:01.208 --> 25:04.169
There's no need to apologize.
You don't have to pretend with me.

25:05.795 --> 25:06.922
I'm just glad you're okay.

25:08.590 --> 25:09.716
Thank you.

25:22.812 --> 25:24.231
[sighs]

25:35.450 --> 25:37.494
Just lift your arms as far as they can go.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.537
- [groans]
- I know.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.666
[wincing and sobbing]

25:44.000 --> 25:45.502
You're okay. You're okay.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.171
[groans and sobs]

25:50.924 --> 25:52.175
[Dawn] It's gonna be okay.

25:57.514 --> 25:58.932
Careful, careful, careful.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.437
Okay, all right?

26:05.939 --> 26:07.691
[sobbing]

26:15.156 --> 26:17.993
It hurts so bad.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.037
[groans]

26:32.716 --> 26:33.717
He's been raped.

26:35.051 --> 26:36.052
Glenn raped him.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.638
Oh, God.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.938
[Dawn] Okay, let's heat up this room.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.110
[Noah] I just-- [groans]

26:52.193 --> 26:55.572
Can I--? I just want to go to bed, please.
I'm tired.

26:56.239 --> 26:59.159
I'm just gonna clean you up
and you can go right to bed, okay?

26:59.743 --> 27:01.494
- [groans]
- I promise.

27:03.413 --> 27:04.331
It's okay.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.461
[panting and sobbing]

27:11.171 --> 27:12.547
I know.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.848
[Talvinder] Guys... Guys, wait!

27:22.766 --> 27:25.685
Guys, please, don't leave me out here!
It's dark!

27:25.769 --> 27:28.938
I can't spend the night out here
by myself!

27:29.022 --> 27:31.358
No? Maybe if you didn't have Noah
make every fire for you,

27:31.441 --> 27:33.318
you could have figured out
how to do one yourself.

27:33.401 --> 27:35.111
Yeah, and if you learned
even basic orientation,

27:35.195 --> 27:36.237
you could walk back.

27:36.321 --> 27:40.200
You guys, please, please.
Please, you guys, please!

27:40.950 --> 27:42.494
[Dawn, mocking] "Please! Please!"

27:42.577 --> 27:44.412
"Please, Noah? Please?"

27:44.496 --> 27:45.330
[Peter] Guys, that's enough.

27:47.374 --> 27:50.043
- I think we should take her back with us.
- Jesus, Peter!

27:51.753 --> 27:52.670
Here's a thought.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.964
How about you spend less time
worrying about that little skank,

27:55.048 --> 27:56.674
and more time worrying
about your so-called friends.

27:57.717 --> 27:58.802
What are you talking about?

27:58.885 --> 28:02.889
"Noah, buddy, you have no chance
with Talvinder. Move on."

28:04.724 --> 28:06.309
Because I'm busy sticking
my traitor dick in her.

28:06.393 --> 28:08.395
You just thought
you'd leave that part out, huh?

28:11.231 --> 28:13.274
Well, it's decision time,
Bene-dick Arnold.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.486
You with us?

28:16.569 --> 28:17.612
‘Cause if you're not,

28:18.988 --> 28:21.366
spend the night with that little slut
over there.

28:25.703 --> 28:27.580
In fact, you have my permission.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.168
[Susan] We'll be back tomorrow.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.879
Hope you grow a conscience overnight.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.133
Good night.

28:41.261 --> 28:42.804
Peter, let's go.

28:48.017 --> 28:50.603
[engine starts and revs]

28:52.814 --> 28:56.234
You put me on trial for the shit I did,
Susan?

28:57.986 --> 28:59.654
What about you, huh?

29:02.490 --> 29:04.576
What about Marcie Ray?

29:06.786 --> 29:10.874
Oh, gee, not looking so smug
and superior anymore now, are you?

29:11.458 --> 29:12.542
You know, let-- let's go.

29:12.625 --> 29:14.210
See you later, loser!

29:14.294 --> 29:15.587
Who's Marcie?

29:15.670 --> 29:18.423
Marcie Ray was a girl
Susan went to high school with.

29:18.506 --> 29:20.592
They fooled around.

29:20.675 --> 29:23.803
Susan outed her to the entire school,
and guess what happened next?

29:23.887 --> 29:25.972
You shut the fuck up, Tal!

29:26.055 --> 29:29.976
Marcie hung herself in her bedroom closet,

29:30.059 --> 29:32.479
which is kind of poetic
if you think about it.

29:32.562 --> 29:33.730
Did that really happen?

29:34.647 --> 29:38.651
Asks the girl who fucked her own
stepfather just to get back at her mother!

29:38.735 --> 29:40.320
Can't make this shit up, folks!

29:41.863 --> 29:43.156
And what about you, Andi, huh?

29:43.239 --> 29:46.993
Poor little Andi had to sell drugs
to pay for her tuition.

29:47.076 --> 29:47.952
Good for you, girl.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.663
No one would ever suspect you
of being a goddamn drug dealer.

29:50.747 --> 29:51.956
Talvinder, that's enough!

29:55.460 --> 29:57.128
I have something on all of you.

29:58.129 --> 30:00.673
I have names and I have details,

30:00.757 --> 30:03.635
and if you guys don't take me back
with you right fucking now,

30:03.718 --> 30:08.681
I swear to God, I will tell your big,
bad secrets to anyone who will listen!

30:10.600 --> 30:11.935
I will.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.270
Watch me. I will.

30:15.396 --> 30:16.272
Fuck.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.107
[Dawn] You know what, Talvinder?

30:18.191 --> 30:21.027
I thought you were a friend,
like a real friend,

30:21.110 --> 30:22.821
but you're actually a fuckin' bitch.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.072
[scoffs]

30:24.155 --> 30:26.032
Well, at least we have that in common.

30:26.115 --> 30:28.243
Fine, just get in then!

30:28.326 --> 30:29.410
No!

30:29.953 --> 30:34.833
Look... she's playing you,
just like she played me, okay?

30:34.916 --> 30:37.043
I say fuck that and fuck her!

30:38.962 --> 30:40.588
You got nothing on me.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.428
You're right, Noah.

30:47.512 --> 30:51.432
I have nothing on you
because you're pathetic!

30:54.143 --> 30:55.353
Now that it's all out in the open,

30:55.436 --> 30:59.065
you thinking that I might
actually ever want to get with you?

30:59.649 --> 31:00.984
Seriously?

31:01.067 --> 31:06.281
Because dating a guy who cums in his sock
every night is at the very top of my list!

31:06.364 --> 31:07.198
Shut the fuck up!

31:10.201 --> 31:12.537
- He's obviously lying.
- I do not know that.

31:12.620 --> 31:15.123
Every hit that I got from him
says that he's telling the truth.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.919
I believe that he honestly
had no idea that Megan was poisoned.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.170
[Peter] That's easy to say.

31:21.254 --> 31:22.130
But come on, man.

31:22.213 --> 31:25.550
He murdered that guy, stuffed his body
in a freezer, stole his identity.

31:25.633 --> 31:27.051
But he had a motive for that.

31:28.177 --> 31:30.972
He needed to disappear.
There is no motive here.

31:31.764 --> 31:33.600
Something just does not sit right.

31:33.683 --> 31:35.643
What are you saying?
You want to let him go?

31:36.269 --> 31:38.646
Renee, nobody's saying that.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.649
- But if he isn't the killer--
- No! No!

31:41.733 --> 31:44.903
He murdered a man and he raped
and he tortured Noah!

31:57.665 --> 32:00.209
- [sighs]
- [Peter] So what do we do now?

32:00.835 --> 32:03.713
Glenn may not be the killer
but he is a killer

32:03.796 --> 32:06.507
so do we just keep him in there
until help arrives, or what?

32:06.591 --> 32:08.801
I don't know.
He's a sitting duck out there.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.804
Wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

32:14.807 --> 32:15.725
Use him as bait.

32:29.155 --> 32:30.990
[door creaking]

32:33.743 --> 32:35.036
[groans]

32:37.080 --> 32:38.373
[exhales and groans]

32:40.375 --> 32:41.960
You still playing games, Mark?

32:44.504 --> 32:45.713
It still isn't funny.

32:49.634 --> 32:50.635
I'm not Mark.

32:54.097 --> 32:57.016
And trust me, this is no game.

33:05.274 --> 33:06.442
Why did you kill Antoine?

33:07.151 --> 33:09.237
I didn't, Renee. I swear I didn't.

33:10.571 --> 33:14.450
Antoine was the kindest,
most generous person I ever met,

33:15.994 --> 33:17.328
always willing to take a risk,

33:18.204 --> 33:19.205
be vulnerable,

33:20.540 --> 33:21.582
so courageous.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.961
He fought assholes like you
his entire life.

33:25.044 --> 33:26.295
[groans]

33:26.379 --> 33:28.006
[winces and panting]

33:28.673 --> 33:32.760
I thought you were some kind
of a pacifist, you know, do no harm.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.388
I'm gonna ask you one last time.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.891
- Did you kill him?
- No! Jesus Christ!

33:41.185 --> 33:42.562
[grunts]

33:44.230 --> 33:45.773
Okay, you crazy bitch.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.651
You wanna talk about
your precious Antoine?

33:48.735 --> 33:49.610
Let's talk about him.

33:50.194 --> 33:51.612
Let's see.

33:51.696 --> 33:54.323
Nice guy, real warm hands,
but you know what?

33:54.407 --> 33:56.617
I'm confused about one part
of your relationship

33:56.701 --> 33:58.036
maybe you could help me clear up.

33:58.119 --> 34:01.622
Was it just that you were both
too chickenshit to choose a side?

34:01.706 --> 34:02.665
Is that it?

34:02.749 --> 34:05.626
Or were you just so afraid to fuck a girl

34:05.710 --> 34:08.671
that you chose a nice,
soft dick instead, huh?

34:16.137 --> 34:17.221
[doorknob rattles]

34:19.015 --> 34:20.600
[grunts] Must be jammed or something.

34:20.683 --> 34:23.227
Oh, and your wedding, that blessed day.
I'm just wondering,

34:23.770 --> 34:25.813
did you both have bouquets?
You did, didn't you?

34:25.897 --> 34:28.608
You had the roses and he had
the fuckin' tulips, didn't he, huh?

34:28.691 --> 34:31.235
Am I right about that?
[laughs and grunts]

34:31.319 --> 34:34.781
I wish when you ate Antoine you
would have fucking choked on him,

34:34.864 --> 34:35.948
you fucking piece of shit!

34:36.032 --> 34:39.202
- That would have been a beautiful death.
- You know what's beautiful?

34:39.285 --> 34:41.037
I never told you what he tasted like.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.371
He tasted like veal.

34:42.455 --> 34:45.958
Mmm!
So good, so flavorful, texture just right.

34:46.042 --> 34:49.003
A little chewy but that was my fault
'cause of the way I cooked him.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.672
But otherwise, he was fucking delicious!

34:51.756 --> 34:53.299
You fucker!

34:53.382 --> 34:55.593
[screaming]

34:59.555 --> 35:01.265
You fucking bitch!

35:01.349 --> 35:03.518
I'm gonna fucking destroy you!

35:03.601 --> 35:06.229
I'm gonna fucking rip your arms off
and beat you to fucking death!

35:07.021 --> 35:08.898
- [muffled screaming]
- Renee!

35:09.482 --> 35:11.567
[grunts] Renee, stop!

35:12.610 --> 35:14.070
Shit.

35:22.995 --> 35:24.705
I want you to feel remorse.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.791
[panting]

35:27.917 --> 35:34.507
I would be more than happy to,
except I didn't fucking do anything.

35:35.466 --> 35:38.511
You tortured that boy,
and you killed Antoine!

35:38.594 --> 35:39.846
[screams]

35:39.929 --> 35:41.347
[groaning]

35:41.430 --> 35:43.057
Jesus fuck--

35:45.852 --> 35:48.146
Are you feeling something now,
you psychopath?

35:48.229 --> 35:50.189
[grunts and wheezes]

35:50.273 --> 35:54.152
Because what I need you to do
is focus, feel the right things.

35:54.235 --> 35:55.236
[groans]

35:55.903 --> 35:57.989
[muffled screaming]

36:01.534 --> 36:05.121
- What is she doing to him?
- She's killing him... slowly.

36:07.623 --> 36:09.333
Maybe we can take the hinges off the door.

36:09.417 --> 36:10.418
[muffled screams and yells]

36:10.501 --> 36:12.378
- Mark? Are you okay?
- No.

36:12.461 --> 36:14.881
I can't. I can't. I can't. I'm sorry.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.382
I'm sorry. I can't.

36:17.216 --> 36:20.052
There's got to be another way in there.
Another door or window?

36:20.136 --> 36:22.555
There is... in the back,

36:22.638 --> 36:24.849
but it's probably buried
under six feet of snow.

36:24.932 --> 36:26.017
I'll go get a shovel.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.192
Tell me.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.027
Say it.

36:37.111 --> 36:38.529
"I killed Antoine."

36:38.613 --> 36:40.615
[panting] I didn't.

36:40.698 --> 36:44.785
I didn't kill your fucking husband,
you crazy lesbo bitch!

36:49.749 --> 36:51.751
[panting]

36:52.460 --> 36:53.419
Say that again.

36:53.502 --> 36:56.589
- Oh, no, no, please.
- One more time.

36:58.925 --> 37:01.260
[screaming]

37:09.810 --> 37:10.895
Did you kill Antoine?

37:11.604 --> 37:14.023
[sobbing]

37:14.815 --> 37:17.818
I did. I did. I did. I confess.

37:18.527 --> 37:23.532
Please, stop! Please, stop! Please, stop!
I confess.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.912
[screaming]

37:32.875 --> 37:35.002
[panting]

37:41.592 --> 37:44.011
What-- What's going on?
What happened?

37:44.095 --> 37:46.472
What's going on? Are you okay?

37:47.932 --> 37:48.975
Are you okay?

37:53.688 --> 37:54.814
It's gonna be fine.

37:56.190 --> 37:57.149
Yeah. [panting]

38:02.405 --> 38:04.907
[panting and groaning]

38:27.847 --> 38:29.140
What do you feel, Glenn?

38:34.520 --> 38:36.314
The correct answer is you're sorry.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.279
[softly] I'm sorry.

38:47.742 --> 38:50.369
I want to believe you. I do.

38:55.041 --> 38:56.167
Pain changes us.

38:58.085 --> 38:59.086
It changed me.

39:00.254 --> 39:01.964
[sobbing]

39:02.048 --> 39:03.924
But I don't feel your remorse, Glenn,

39:04.717 --> 39:06.218
not yet.

39:08.429 --> 39:09.263
When I know...

39:10.014 --> 39:13.768
deep down that you truly, truly are sorry
for what you've done,

39:15.895 --> 39:16.896
this stops.

39:16.979 --> 39:19.732
[sobbing]

39:19.815 --> 39:21.400
I'm sorry, Renee.

39:21.484 --> 39:22.485
I am.

39:24.528 --> 39:25.529
I'm so sorry.

39:28.115 --> 39:29.116
Antoine...

39:30.493 --> 39:32.495
was an incredible man

39:33.996 --> 39:35.581
and I deserve this.

39:36.665 --> 39:37.666
Thank you.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.878
[sobbing]

39:40.961 --> 39:42.963
- Okay.
- [thud on door]

39:43.047 --> 39:44.757
[rattling at door]

39:44.840 --> 39:46.884
- [Keira] Renee, please!
- [thumping on door]

39:46.967 --> 39:49.553
- [Peter] Renee, open the door!
- [Keira] Renee, don't do it!

39:49.637 --> 39:52.681
- [sobbing]
- [shouting outside, indistinct]

39:54.016 --> 39:56.268
- [Peter] Renee, please!
- [Keira] Renee!

39:56.352 --> 39:58.187
- [Peter] Renee, stop!
- It's okay.

39:58.270 --> 40:01.148
- Shh, shh...
- [Peter] Renee, listen--

40:01.232 --> 40:02.775
- It's over.
- [Peter] Listen to me!

40:02.858 --> 40:04.193
- Yes, it's over.
- [Keira] Renee, stop!

40:04.276 --> 40:06.195
- It's okay.
- Don't kill him!

40:06.278 --> 40:07.780
- [clicking]
- It's okay.

40:07.863 --> 40:10.324
- [thumping at door]
- Shh...

40:12.284 --> 40:14.829
[gurgling and grunting]

40:19.708 --> 40:21.127
[death rattle]

40:33.055 --> 40:34.890
You won't be killing anyone anymore.

40:59.957 --> 41:03.669
We need to act like nothing's changed,
not until we know we're safe.

41:08.090 --> 41:09.133
We'll sleep in shifts.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.093
No one comes or goes.

41:13.596 --> 41:14.680
I'll take the first one.

41:59.225 --> 42:00.518
[rustling]

42:18.827 --> 42:20.329
[creaking]

42:24.166 --> 42:25.376
[door shuts]

42:35.177 --> 42:37.179
[soft groaning]

43:16.302 --> 43:17.553
Fuck you.

43:25.144 --> 43:27.062
[wincing and groaning]

43:37.489 --> 43:38.490
Hello?

43:40.492 --> 43:41.702
Peter?

43:48.083 --> 43:49.835
You guys couldn't sleep either, huh?

43:51.128 --> 43:53.213
[groaning and wincing]

43:55.341 --> 43:56.759
[shudders]

43:56.842 --> 44:00.554
I think I'm just gonna warm myself
by the fire and then head to bed.

44:07.936 --> 44:08.771
If that's okay.

44:32.836 --> 44:35.047
[panting] Oh, God.

44:53.690 --> 44:55.984
[screaming]

45:07.830 --> 45:10.374
- Typical slut, showing your tits!
- Get off of me!

45:10.457 --> 45:13.001
Noah! Noah, what the fuck--? Stop!

45:13.085 --> 45:14.586
- Noah! Noah!
- Shut the fuck up!

45:14.670 --> 45:16.630
- No!
- Oh, my God!

45:16.713 --> 45:18.132
What the fuck are you doing?

45:18.215 --> 45:19.258
[muffled screams]

45:19.341 --> 45:22.136
Shut up! Someone needs to teach you
fucking manners!

45:22.845 --> 45:26.306
You think you can fucking laugh at me?
Stop fucking moving!

45:27.141 --> 45:29.143
- No! No!
- Here's what you wanted.

45:29.726 --> 45:32.521
- Stop it! Noah, please!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

45:34.940 --> 45:36.233
[groaning]

45:36.817 --> 45:37.901
Talvinder, are you okay?

45:37.985 --> 45:39.528
- Stay away from me!
- Talvinder, are you okay?

45:39.611 --> 45:42.030
Get the fuck away from me, all of you!

45:45.284 --> 45:46.910
How could you do something like that?

45:46.994 --> 45:48.412
[panting]

45:50.664 --> 45:52.124
Because she embarrassed you?

45:52.207 --> 45:53.500
She hurt your fucking feelings?

45:53.584 --> 45:55.836
- I don't owe you a fucking explanation!
- Shut the fuck up!

45:55.919 --> 45:57.129
Oh, my God!

45:59.339 --> 46:02.593
She could get herself hurt out there.
We got to go find her.

46:04.052 --> 46:06.346
Talvinder! Talvinder!

46:07.556 --> 46:09.475
- [Susan] Wait, Tal!
- [Dawn] Tal!

46:09.558 --> 46:10.601
- [Peter] Talvinder!
- Tal!

46:11.977 --> 46:13.395
[Susan] Talvinder!

46:18.692 --> 46:20.110
Fuck.

46:43.592 --> 46:44.760
Is he dead?

46:50.098 --> 46:51.433
Are we safe?

46:54.436 --> 46:55.646
No, we're not, Renee.

47:12.913 --> 47:13.872
Where's Noah?

47:23.715 --> 47:25.425
[footsteps on stairs]

47:27.386 --> 47:28.470
Noah, you up here, buddy?

47:34.351 --> 47:35.394
Noah!

47:40.107 --> 47:41.441
Noah's not in his room.

47:42.651 --> 47:44.361
I fell asleep. I couldn't stay awake.

47:44.444 --> 47:46.238
Maybe he just went out for some fresh air.

47:46.321 --> 47:48.490
Maybe-- Maybe he couldn't sleep
and he went for a walk.

47:48.574 --> 47:49.908
Did you see his feet?

47:50.701 --> 47:51.577
[Renee] He's fine.

47:52.869 --> 47:54.246
We're all fine.

47:55.205 --> 47:57.040
The killer's dead. We're safe now.

48:00.711 --> 48:01.837
I'm gonna go find him.

48:01.920 --> 48:03.213
You're not going by yourself.

48:12.764 --> 48:13.849
Let's go.

48:16.602 --> 48:19.646
When we get back,
we need to do something about her.

48:20.606 --> 48:21.815
She's dangerous.

48:38.707 --> 48:40.417
No, no, no. No.

48:40.500 --> 48:42.502
[panting]

48:49.259 --> 48:50.302
Noah.

48:51.303 --> 48:52.721
[Keira] Peter?

48:54.097 --> 48:55.015
Turn him over.

49:13.659 --> 49:14.701
[Peter] It's Talvinder.
