00:02.083 --> 00:03.583
Got somthing on your face...

00:03.683 --> 00:05.683
oh oh what?
Me.

00:05.783 --> 00:10.798
my god I feel like such a hoebag
but I'm still glad I did it

00:11.983 --> 00:14.983
I do declare spending special
relationary time with my girlfriend...

00:15.083 --> 00:18.683
makes me happier then a
bullfrog in a beetle bin

00:18.783 --> 00:20.283
Why are you talking like that?

00:20.383 --> 00:22.384
Cause I'm smitten with my
girlfriend lady...

00:22.484 --> 00:24.484
and this is my smitten voice

00:24.584 --> 00:26.584
Why? What voice do you use
when you're smitten

00:26.684 --> 00:28.684
My normal voice

00:28.784 --> 00:32.084
You know what? You hide it well
but you're a very strange person

00:32.183 --> 00:34.184
M'aam

00:48.684 --> 00:50.204
How'd I do...

00:50.304 --> 00:52.304
17 that's impressive...

00:52.404 --> 00:54.404
but I'm going to kick your arse...

00:54.504 --> 00:56.504
and, time me

00:57.704 --> 00:59.004
What's going on seabizzle?

00:59.104 --> 01:01.104
We're seeing who can last the
longest in Mr Silar's room

01:01.204 --> 01:04.203
He has a fungal infection under the
fat flaps in his stomash

01:04.304 --> 01:08.104
It smells like the time I put Izzy's
doo-doo diaper in the microwave.

01:08.204 --> 01:10.804
you guys are playing smelly-belly

01:10.904 --> 01:12.904
Time?
16 seconds.

01:13.004 --> 01:15.504
Come on - I win
See that's what I'm talking about...

01:15.604 --> 01:18.404
that's how it goes when you fight me

01:18.504 --> 01:21.004
Hold On Turk Let's
not declare victory...

01:21.104 --> 01:23.004
until we give a shot
to Dr John Dorian...

01:23.104 --> 01:25.229
and his nostrils of steel

01:25.428 --> 01:27.628
Your nose can't handle smells
of that magnitude

01:27.728 --> 01:29.728
Make some room...

01:29.843 --> 01:31.343
uh-huh, on the clock uh-huh...

01:31.443 --> 01:32.743
you have got to be kidding me...

01:32.843 --> 01:34.843
that is the most disgusting thing
I have ever smelt...

01:34.943 --> 01:38.943
and a sugar free latte for...
the winner

01:39.043 --> 01:41.083
Victory tastes delicious

01:41.173 --> 01:42.643
You guys aren't even friends...

01:42.743 --> 01:45.243
why do you spend so much time
competing over every thing...

01:45.343 --> 01:46.843
because we're men...

01:46.943 --> 01:48.443
and that's what men do...

01:48.543 --> 01:49.843
now a quick look to Turk...

01:49.943 --> 01:51.948
to see if that is what men do

01:52.048 --> 01:53.548
Huh whatta you know...

01:53.648 --> 01:56.648
don't forget I crushed you in
find the vein in the junkie...

01:56.748 --> 01:59.648
yeah but I beat you good at gossball

01:59.748 --> 02:02.748
That's nothing yesterday
I won fee muffins for life...

02:02.848 --> 02:04.148
by guessing how many coffee beans...

02:04.248 --> 02:05.648
there were in that there jar

02:05.748 --> 02:07.048
Actually they had a recount...

02:07.148 --> 02:08.548
and you came in second

02:08.648 --> 02:10.148
What?
Who came in first?

02:10.247 --> 02:13.348
#You know the muffin man
the muffin man#

02:13.448 --> 02:15.048
If anyone need me I'll
be in my office...

02:15.148 --> 02:18.038
going to town on these bad boys...

02:19.448 --> 02:20.848
why are you guys obsessed...

02:20.948 --> 02:22.648
with reliving everything you've won

02:22.748 --> 02:24.788
Because we're winners...

02:24.878 --> 02:26.848
and that's what winners do...

02:26.948 --> 02:29.548
back to Turk for confirmation...

02:29.648 --> 02:30.648
damn it.

02:30.748 --> 02:32.248
if you'd ever won anything...

02:32.348 --> 02:33.948
you'd know what we're talking about

02:34.048 --> 02:36.343
Oh I've won something Perry

02:43.000 --> 02:46.060
We threw our nerd farther then yours

02:46.500 --> 02:48.500
Suck It Bitch

02:48.900 --> 02:51.900
Guys I think their
nerd is unconscious...

02:52.000 --> 02:54.720
we should probably roll him over

02:55.000 --> 02:59.335
That's the moment I realised
I wanted to be a doctor

03:00.500 --> 03:04.500
Scrubs - Season 7 Episode 6
My Number One Doctor

03:04.600 --> 03:06.600
Subtitles by STS

03:14.900 --> 03:17.300
Every doctor has their own way
of dealing with patients

03:17.400 --> 03:19.400
Turk was all about efficiency

03:19.500 --> 03:21.500
Why are you standing on a chair?

03:21.600 --> 03:23.600
Because from this spot I can see
into 4 rooms...

03:23.700 --> 03:25.700
without actually going in...

03:25.800 --> 03:27.100
check it

03:27.200 --> 03:28.500
Patients of Doctor Turk...

03:28.600 --> 03:29.900
how are we?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
OK...

03:31.100 --> 03:32.900
all good

03:33.000 --> 03:34.300
Fine...

03:34.400 --> 03:35.900
muffled answer...

03:36.000 --> 03:37.500
guy had some tongue surgery...

03:37.600 --> 03:39.600
he's actually OK though

03:40.600 --> 03:42.600
Elliot referred a more
personal approach

03:42.700 --> 03:45.760
Shannon what's happening girlfriend?

03:45.845 --> 03:47.800
yeah I know I cant pull off
calling someone girlfriend...

03:47.900 --> 03:49.400
but she likes it so

03:49.500 --> 03:51.500
I do can't help it

03:53.800 --> 03:55.800
Shannon's back...

03:55.900 --> 03:57.900
it's been so great
getting to know her...

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
see that's the great thing
about being in private practice

04:00.100 --> 04:03.700
You get to treat the same patients
all the time...

04:03.800 --> 04:05.800
oh come on you guys...

04:05.900 --> 04:09.470
[whispers] shhh
people are sleeping here...

04:09.553 --> 04:11.500
[whispers] well I guess you
think it's so funny...

04:11.600 --> 04:12.900
[speaks normally] Why am I whispering...

04:13.000 --> 04:15.500
listen Barbie, I'd love to take
credit for this idea...

04:15.600 --> 04:18.404
but it was all Big Bobby Kelso...

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
ah come on heck

04:23.100 --> 04:26.300
Quick announcement
I have signed sacred heart...

04:26.400 --> 04:29.600
up for website called
Rate your Doctor...

04:29.700 --> 04:32.700
where patients can evaluate
and score their doctors

04:32.800 --> 04:35.300
I think it's going to lead to a better
patient care...

04:35.400 --> 04:36.900
and if along the way...

04:37.000 --> 04:38.500
you all become paranoid
and overly competitive...

04:38.600 --> 04:40.100
happy birthday to me

04:40.200 --> 04:42.500
Dr Kelso I became a doctor
to save lives...

04:42.600 --> 04:44.100
heal wounds...

04:44.200 --> 04:46.200
and occasionally drop the M.D. Bomb...

04:46.300 --> 04:48.300
to pull hot tail in bars...

04:48.400 --> 04:49.800
you know what else works?

04:49.900 --> 04:51.900
Cosmonaut. Try it thank me later

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Noted

05:02.900 --> 05:04.900
Oh I reckon my lady is as purty...

05:05.000 --> 05:07.500
as a porcupine on roller skates...

05:07.600 --> 05:09.200
that doesn't even make sense

05:09.300 --> 05:11.300
That's what we smitten folk
call a metaphor...

05:11.400 --> 05:12.800
you young lady...

05:12.900 --> 05:14.900
have a head that's as empty as...

05:15.000 --> 05:17.700
a whipperwheel in a tub of moonshine...

05:17.800 --> 05:19.800
there you go...

05:20.400 --> 05:22.400
he's out of his freaking mind...

05:22.500 --> 05:24.500
how does that woman go out with him?

05:24.600 --> 05:26.600
Well I would say that love is blind...

05:26.700 --> 05:28.700
but we both know that isn't true...

05:28.800 --> 05:30.500
my love for Enid falls
a percentage point...

05:30.600 --> 05:32.600
with every pound she gains

05:32.700 --> 05:34.100
Since our wedding day

05:34.200 --> 05:36.200
I am 136% less in love with her...

05:36.300 --> 05:38.300
you really going to comment
on your wife's weight...

05:38.400 --> 05:40.400
when you have muffins
stuffed down your pants

05:40.500 --> 05:42.500
I like them warm

05:46.600 --> 05:48.100
So you're experiencing...

05:48.200 --> 05:49.700
vomiting and shortness of breath...

05:49.800 --> 05:51.800
neither of which are consistant
with your ALS...

05:51.900 --> 05:53.200
[JD] It's hard to be comfortable...

05:53.300 --> 05:54.600
around terminal patients...

05:54.700 --> 05:56.100
but Shannon made it easy

05:56.200 --> 05:57.600
So how's the ALS progressing

05:57.700 --> 05:59.200
Oh it's been a blast...

05:59.300 --> 06:00.700
her legs are fully paralysed...

06:00.800 --> 06:02.800
and her arms are on their way

06:02.900 --> 06:04.400
That does sound fun...

06:04.500 --> 06:05.900
yeah but you know what

06:06.000 --> 06:07.400
I think I'm ready for all this...

06:07.500 --> 06:08.900
said goodbye to all my friends...

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
hell I even had my funeral already...

06:11.100 --> 06:14.245
she looked so beautiful in her casket

06:14.333 --> 06:15.600
I'm sure you did

06:15.700 --> 06:17.200
I wasn't in a casket

06:17.300 --> 06:18.800
I know that...

06:18.900 --> 06:20.700
come on who would do that...

06:20.800 --> 06:22.300
except for vampires

06:22.400 --> 06:24.400
I told you he was gullible

06:24.500 --> 06:26.000
Shannon I hate to leave...

06:26.100 --> 06:28.100
but I really want to get these down
the lab for testing

06:28.200 --> 06:29.200
OK

06:29.300 --> 06:31.300
I can stay...

06:31.800 --> 06:34.800
so you went to your own funeral huh...

06:34.900 --> 06:36.900
people sad enough for you?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.300
most of them...

06:38.400 --> 06:40.700
and anyone that wasn't crying
got a talking to

06:40.800 --> 06:42.500
You should have invited me

06:42.600 --> 06:44.000
I can cry on cue...

06:44.100 --> 06:46.100
say dead puppies 'dead puppies'

06:46.200 --> 06:47.600
Connecting with patients...

06:47.700 --> 06:50.500
always come easier to me
then it did to some others

06:50.600 --> 06:52.500
Have a good day Mr Woolmer

06:52.600 --> 06:54.900
Wow... you actually learned
your patients name

06:55.000 --> 06:56.700
If you don't kill them
in the operating room...

06:56.800 --> 06:58.300
you can take them out dancing

06:58.400 --> 06:59.900
I doubt it

07:00.000 --> 07:01.500
I'm amputating his foot later...

07:01.600 --> 07:03.100
but he's still going to give me
a good review...

07:03.200 --> 07:05.200
you see we're D.B.F.Fs Huh?

07:05.300 --> 07:07.100
Diabetic best friends forever...

07:07.200 --> 07:09.600
you don't usually bond
with your patients

07:09.700 --> 07:12.200
You're not going to change who
you are as a doctor...

07:12.300 --> 07:14.000
to get good ratings are you?

07:14.100 --> 07:16.100
Hell to the no

07:16.200 --> 07:17.400
Are you?

07:17.500 --> 07:19.500
{laughs] oh please.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.300
So you're declining chemo...

07:22.400 --> 07:24.600
because wikipedia says
the raw food diet...

07:24.700 --> 07:27.700
reverses the effects of bone cancer

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Well - Hey any info you have...

07:31.100 --> 07:33.100
that I can pass on to
my other patients...

07:33.200 --> 07:34.500
would just be super and by-the-by...

07:34.600 --> 07:35.800
while you're on your computer...

07:35.900 --> 07:41.255
perhaps you could jump over to a
site called rateyourdoc. org...

07:44.300 --> 07:45.500
patients of Doctor Turk...

07:45.600 --> 07:47.000
would you like any ono-on-one time...

07:47.100 --> 07:48.400
with your surgeon

07:48.500 --> 07:50.500
Please. Sure.
Yeah. Love to.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.100
A private consultation
with my surgeon...

07:52.200 --> 07:54.200
would be very much appreciated
thank you

07:54.300 --> 07:57.870
Damn someone's done
their healing too fast

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
There, I gave you 5 stars

08:00.100 --> 08:04.100
Thank you and now I have
to take your laptop from you...

08:04.200 --> 08:08.200
as I've deemed you just too
damn stupid to use it.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.300
You see those bell peppers
that you're munching

08:10.400 --> 08:12.400
They're going to do a
truckload of jack...

08:12.500 --> 08:14.500
against the cancer raging
inside of your body...

08:14.600 --> 08:17.600
of course I've only been a doctor
for some twenty years...

08:17.700 --> 08:19.424
and the person who wrote...

08:19.524 --> 08:21.508
that wikipedia entry also authored...

08:21.608 --> 08:23.631
the Battlestar Galactica
episode guide...

08:23.731 --> 08:25.731
so what the heck do I know...

08:25.831 --> 08:29.831
but if you feel like living page me...

08:33.530 --> 08:35.931
so 'Lady' is an unusual name

08:36.030 --> 08:37.231
Oh tell me about it

08:37.331 --> 08:38.731
I was conceived after my parents...

08:38.831 --> 08:40.431
saw the movie 'Lady and the Tramp'

08:40.530 --> 08:42.530
That's so sweet yeah

08:42.631 --> 08:45.031
Oh gotta go and meet my guy out front

08:45.131 --> 08:47.131
Nice meeting you Carla

08:48.331 --> 08:51.051
Sir you'll never believe this...

08:51.431 --> 08:53.431
'Lady' is normal

08:54.031 --> 08:56.731
I'm sorry did you
also win free muffins for life

08:56.831 --> 08:58.331
I didn't think so

08:58.431 --> 09:00.731
Now let me read the final
Harry Potter novel in peace...

09:00.831 --> 09:02.831
everyone's already read that...

09:02.931 --> 09:04.931
yes but if anyone divulges
any details to me...

09:05.031 --> 09:06.731
what happens Murphy?

09:06.831 --> 09:08.831
You draw Harry Potter Glasses
on their face...

09:08.931 --> 09:10.931
in permanent marker That's right

09:11.031 --> 09:13.031
Now I don't give a hoot...

09:13.131 --> 09:15.331
about the janitor and his gal pal OK...

09:15.431 --> 09:16.931
so shove off

09:17.031 --> 09:19.031
You wouldn't dare draw on me...

09:19.131 --> 09:20.731
and I already know if Harry...

09:20.831 --> 09:22.871
lives or dies at the end

09:23.731 --> 09:26.451
So Lady's completely normal huh?

09:27.531 --> 09:29.531
Can you believe that?

09:31.331 --> 09:32.831
HI Elliot wassup?

09:32.931 --> 09:34.131
Good News

09:34.231 --> 09:36.731
Your symptoms aren't ALS related
you just took to many baclofens...

09:36.831 --> 09:38.831
you probably just mixed up your meds...

09:38.931 --> 09:40.931
[JD] In a hospital little mysteries...

09:41.031 --> 09:42.831
get solved every day

09:42.931 --> 09:43.931
You look nice

09:44.031 --> 09:47.531
I'm just glad to get out of that uni
and into my regular clothes.

09:47.631 --> 09:49.231
That's why she likes him...

09:49.331 --> 09:50.831
he's pretending to be normal...

09:50.931 --> 09:52.931
[shouts] NO WAY.

09:53.031 --> 09:54.431
too much?
mmm-huh...

09:54.531 --> 09:56.531
[JD] Sometimes the answers right
in front of your face...

09:56.631 --> 09:58.631
you gotta be kidding me
there has to be an error...

09:58.731 --> 10:00.715
are you guys still looking
at that stupid website?

10:00.815 --> 10:03.798
I told you those ratings
are meaningle.......

10:03.898 --> 10:05.398
I'm number 1

10:05.498 --> 10:07.898
The number 1 doctor yes yes...

10:07.998 --> 10:09.998
number 1 number 1

10:10.098 --> 10:12.098
I gotta make a big phone call...

10:12.198 --> 10:14.198
call mommy...

10:14.598 --> 10:16.398
and sometime you never could
have seen it coming

10:16.498 --> 10:18.198
You gotta be more careful with
your medications

10:18.298 --> 10:19.998
I mean the Baclofens aren't so bad...

10:20.098 --> 10:22.123
but if you took too
many benzodiazepines

10:22.223 --> 10:24.223
You could have died...

10:24.310 --> 10:27.298
then that's definately what I'll
do next time

10:27.398 --> 10:29.398
Grape?

10:34.598 --> 10:37.298
Why would you purposefully overdose?

10:37.398 --> 10:39.398
You know the answer to that

10:39.498 --> 10:40.998
I've said my goodbyes...

10:41.098 --> 10:43.098
and soon I won't be able to
move my arms...

10:43.198 --> 10:44.698
or even speak

10:44.798 --> 10:46.798
I am literally going to die...

10:46.898 --> 10:48.398
entombed in this body...

10:48.498 --> 10:50.498
a lifeless burden to Gayle...

10:50.598 --> 10:51.698
who's Gayle?

10:51.798 --> 10:53.298
My home care nurse

10:53.398 --> 10:58.073
I know she's sweet but
she's a little silly for my taste

11:01.098 --> 11:03.098
Oh God she flying.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.923
how is she getting her scarf
to blow like that

11:08.023 --> 11:10.023
I get to go next

11:11.023 --> 11:13.023
Elliot

11:13.123 --> 11:15.923
I want things to end on my terms...

11:16.023 --> 11:17.523
and in a few months

11:17.623 --> 11:19.223
I won't even be able to do that

11:19.323 --> 11:20.923
Why are you telling me all of this?

11:21.023 --> 11:23.723
I mean this goes against
everything I stand for

11:23.823 --> 11:25.823
Shannon I'm your doctor

11:25.923 --> 11:27.223
I know...

11:27.323 --> 11:29.623
but you're also my friend

11:32.963 --> 11:35.163
One blueberry please...

11:38.563 --> 11:40.563
because i can

11:41.363 --> 11:43.363
So.. What do you want to do tonight?

11:43.463 --> 11:45.463
Well it's Friday which is date night

11:45.563 --> 11:47.563
So perhaps we should see a movie...

11:47.663 --> 11:48.863
and then get some ice cream...

11:48.963 --> 11:51.343
while we walk and hold hands

11:51.443 --> 11:53.443
I vote Yes

11:56.043 --> 11:57.543
What the hell are you doing?

11:57.643 --> 11:58.743
Khaki?

11:58.843 --> 12:00.243
You never wear khaki

12:00.343 --> 12:01.643
My uniform is khaki

12:01.743 --> 12:03.143
Your uniform is blue...

12:03.243 --> 12:04.243
no yes...

12:04.343 --> 12:05.643
leave me alone...

12:05.743 --> 12:07.543
yeah right

12:07.643 --> 12:08.643
Are you coming?

12:08.743 --> 12:10.743
well I might as well

12:10.843 --> 12:14.668
Miriam here has already ruined
the book for me

12:17.468 --> 12:18.593
The rate your doc website...

12:18.693 --> 12:20.788
also had a comments section

12:20.888 --> 12:23.388
Oh come on
what's up with Dr Cox's hair?

12:23.488 --> 12:24.988
One week he's bald The next week he...

12:25.088 --> 12:27.573
looks like Shirley Temple
signed Michelle M.

12:27.673 --> 12:30.648
Oh it's called rate your 'doc'. org

12:30.663 --> 12:33.173
I'm on a completely different
more awesome site

12:33.273 --> 12:35.073
See Woah.

12:35.173 --> 12:36.873
Can I borrow your laptop

12:36.973 --> 12:39.413
Just for a second please Thank you

12:39.513 --> 12:40.713
Yep.

12:40.813 --> 12:42.213
Still number one

12:42.313 --> 12:43.913
Now to put the cursor back...

12:44.013 --> 12:45.713
on Doctor Turk who's lower down...

12:45.813 --> 12:47.813
on the ranking list scrolling down...

12:47.913 --> 12:50.463
scrolling scrolling fake watch

12:50.478 --> 12:52.478
Scrolling

12:52.578 --> 12:54.578
There he is...

12:54.678 --> 12:58.213
all the way at the bottom
right above Dr Murphy here

12:58.313 --> 13:01.083
How can I be last?
All my patients are dead

13:01.183 --> 13:04.198
Doug, do you remember that guy
you put in the morgue drawer?

13:04.298 --> 13:05.898
Turns out he was just heavily sedated

13:05.998 --> 13:07.998
Oh yeah you're right...

13:08.098 --> 13:09.598
all the comments are from him

13:09.698 --> 13:11.298
My ALS patient just told me...

13:11.398 --> 13:12.923
she tried to kill herself

13:13.023 --> 13:14.903
Shannon?
What are you going to do?

13:15.003 --> 13:16.203
Well Barbie you have two choices...

13:16.303 --> 13:18.303
you can either tell on her
or look the other way

13:18.403 --> 13:20.898
Now me I'd go ahead and crank up
the Moody Blues...

13:20.998 --> 13:23.863
and suffocate her with a pillow
cause I'm a helper...

13:23.963 --> 13:25.463
as always thank you...

13:25.563 --> 13:26.563
welcome.

13:26.663 --> 13:28.463
Someone named Coco Blasco wrote...

13:28.563 --> 13:29.863
that she's sick of me saying...

13:29.963 --> 13:32.398
'That's what I'm talking about'

13:32.498 --> 13:35.983
but sometimes it is
what I'm talking about

13:37.083 --> 13:38.615
Tell me this...

13:38.715 --> 13:40.715
do you like her?

13:40.815 --> 13:44.345
Well I've never met
her before but nah...

13:44.445 --> 13:46.445
in fact I may hate her

13:48.645 --> 13:50.145
I'm talking about Lady...

13:50.245 --> 13:51.545
if you like her...

13:51.645 --> 13:53.685
you can't keep lying to her
about who you are

13:53.785 --> 13:55.785
Hogwash Lie forever...

13:55.885 --> 13:57.885
it's the natural form
of communication...

13:57.985 --> 13:59.985
between men and women

14:00.085 --> 14:03.402
Hell Enid still thinks it's
too snowy to go outside

14:03.502 --> 14:05.502
I spray the windows
with shaving cream...

14:05.602 --> 14:08.302
to keep her out of the yard
her wheelchair tears up the grass

14:08.402 --> 14:10.502
Until you let Lady know the real you...

14:10.602 --> 14:13.552
your relationship is not real
and it's going to end...

14:13.652 --> 14:15.852
but I want it to end

14:16.652 --> 14:18.652
That's his sad voice

14:22.252 --> 14:24.492
I can't lose to JD
I don't care what it takes

14:24.592 --> 14:25.692
I thought he was your best friend

14:25.792 --> 14:27.392
Winning is way more
important then friendship...

14:27.492 --> 14:29.492
my gran gran taught me that...

14:29.592 --> 14:31.592
his patients love him
how do we undo that...

14:31.692 --> 14:34.517
after you're done rating me
on rateyourdoc. org...

14:34.617 --> 14:37.337
go to my website the toddtime. com...

14:37.437 --> 14:40.262
be sure to check out the
'Tranny Todd' feature

14:40.362 --> 14:45.292
It lets you see what the big dog
looks like with girl parts

14:47.492 --> 14:49.492
M'aam the key to a speedy recovery...

14:49.592 --> 14:51.569
is less moaning more boning...

14:51.669 --> 14:54.744
as sure as my name is
Doctor John Dorian...

14:54.844 --> 14:57.643
that's what I'm talking about

14:58.443 --> 15:00.443
I said it again yeah

15:00.543 --> 15:02.543
Ah damn

15:03.243 --> 15:04.243
Hey

15:04.343 --> 15:06.343
I've been looking for you...

15:06.443 --> 15:08.443
you can't imagine what it's like
to know you're going to be...

15:08.543 --> 15:10.543
trapped in your own body...

15:10.643 --> 15:13.618
just waiting for your misery to end

15:13.718 --> 15:15.573
Elliot you can't let this girl do
this again...

15:15.673 --> 15:17.873
you gotta tell Gayle
so she can police it...

15:17.973 --> 15:21.013
but may be dying is
the right choice for her...

15:21.113 --> 15:25.023
but i don't think it's
the right choice for you...

15:25.123 --> 15:27.438
you know as doctors
sometime we have to...

15:27.538 --> 15:29.538
protect ourselves first

15:29.638 --> 15:31.638
I know you better than anybody...

15:31.738 --> 15:34.238
you believe in the sanctity of life...

15:34.338 --> 15:36.338
if you let this girl kill herself...

15:36.438 --> 15:39.073
it's going to haunt you forever

15:39.238 --> 15:41.238
I can handle it...

15:41.338 --> 15:43.503
you remember when you were
treating that teenager...

15:43.603 --> 15:45.403
and you broke his i-pod...

15:45.503 --> 15:48.303
you felt so guilty you let
him take you to prom...

15:48.403 --> 15:51.888
yeah but I left early
and I barely put out

15:51.988 --> 15:55.048
I just don't want you to get hurt...

15:56.889 --> 15:58.889
you're right

15:58.989 --> 16:00.989
I'll tell Gayle

16:01.689 --> 16:03.689
Thanks...

16:04.189 --> 16:07.009
do you know I'm the number one
doctor in the hospital...

16:07.109 --> 16:09.109
yes JD I got all......

16:10.809 --> 16:12.809
Oh hi are we going out?

16:12.909 --> 16:14.909
what's with the jumpsuit?

16:15.009 --> 16:16.609
Well first of all
if we're going to make it...

16:16.709 --> 16:18.509
not a jumpsuit shirt, belt, pants...

16:18.609 --> 16:19.809
oh O.K.

16:19.909 --> 16:23.604
Secondly I think it's time you knew
the real me...

16:23.704 --> 16:25.704
all right here we go

16:25.804 --> 16:28.304
I'm not like normal people

16:28.404 --> 16:31.414
I don't have super powers
but I'm working on it...

16:31.514 --> 16:34.744
for instance watch me move this pen...

16:37.989 --> 16:39.489
it worked at home I don't know why...

16:39.589 --> 16:41.589
maybe my table is slanted...

16:41.689 --> 16:43.689
anyway in my spare time

16:43.789 --> 16:45.789
I also enjoy stuffing animals...

16:45.889 --> 16:47.889
usually with other animals...

16:47.989 --> 16:51.114
for instance a badger
will hold five squirrels...

16:51.214 --> 16:53.714
a squirrel will hold most of a cat...

16:53.814 --> 16:55.814
a mouse will hold a shrew and a vole...

16:55.914 --> 16:57.914
you get the idea circle of life

16:58.014 --> 17:00.014
I have broken the sound barrier...

17:00.114 --> 17:02.114
but you must never ask me how

17:02.214 --> 17:04.513
I don't believe in the moon
I think it's just the back of the sun

17:04.614 --> 17:07.334
Huh I love a good train wreck...

17:07.513 --> 17:09.513
furthermore, I think if you look
closely at...

17:09.614 --> 17:12.598
stop it you
she doesn't know you're joking...

17:12.699 --> 17:13.999
oh he's joking

17:14.098 --> 17:15.499
Thank God...

17:15.598 --> 17:17.598
and so the lying begins

17:17.699 --> 17:19.699
You big joker...

17:19.799 --> 17:23.029
go change and I'll meet you outside...

17:23.773 --> 17:25.273
what just happened?

17:25.374 --> 17:27.374
did I just blackout?
did the pen move?

17:27.473 --> 17:29.474
you have to dole out your crazy
in little pieces...

17:29.574 --> 17:31.574
you can't do it all at once...

17:31.674 --> 17:33.674
oh, all right

17:34.574 --> 17:36.174
Hey watta say 23?

17:36.274 --> 17:38.474
Oh my God another new nickname...

17:38.574 --> 17:39.974
but what does it mean?

17:40.074 --> 17:43.374
play it cool 23
you'll find out eventually...

17:43.474 --> 17:45.474
that's what they call me...

17:45.574 --> 17:46.874
why do they call me that?

17:46.974 --> 17:48.674
It's your new website rating

17:48.774 --> 17:50.374
What?
How did I drop so low?

17:50.474 --> 17:52.474
you know after I fix
that gall bladder...

17:52.574 --> 17:57.419
you might want me to do something
about those flat boobies

17:57.819 --> 18:00.234
All I wanted to do was
win at something...

18:00.334 --> 18:01.834
for once and when I finally do...

18:01.934 --> 18:03.234
you have to go and...

18:03.334 --> 18:05.334
Excuse me
but do you really want me here...

18:05.434 --> 18:07.434
for a lecture that I'm not going
to feel the least bit guilty about...

18:07.534 --> 18:09.534
dismissed...

18:09.934 --> 18:13.634
him I expect this from but you...

18:14.934 --> 18:16.974
you're my closest friend

18:17.034 --> 18:19.034
In college we shared a toothbrush

18:19.134 --> 18:21.599
I was not aware of that we did...

18:21.699 --> 18:25.219
look, is there anything I can do
to make it up to you

18:25.319 --> 18:27.319
Here you go buddy...

18:27.419 --> 18:29.459
your very own unicorn...

18:31.019 --> 18:33.019
she's glorious

18:39.019 --> 18:41.019
Turk My Bad...

18:41.919 --> 18:45.290
is there anything I can do
to make it up to you

18:45.390 --> 18:47.390
Here's your Unicorn

18:47.490 --> 18:50.490
Turk, she's beautiful

18:50.590 --> 18:52.590
Oh look at her mane

18:52.690 --> 18:53.690
Turk

18:53.790 --> 18:56.765
I gotta tell ya Unicorns aren't real...

18:56.865 --> 18:59.160
stop it they're not real...

19:02.565 --> 19:04.565
there's nothing you can do...

19:04.665 --> 19:06.165
what if I let you beat
me in basketball...

19:06.265 --> 19:07.465
while the nurses watch?

19:07.565 --> 19:10.185
Can we yell white lightning
everytime I make a basket...

19:10.285 --> 19:12.285
we always do

19:15.585 --> 19:18.185
Gayle's bringing the cat around
so I guess this is......

19:18.285 --> 19:21.005
Don't You know I hate the G word

19:22.220 --> 19:24.770
Elliot thank you for everything...

19:24.870 --> 19:27.845
you've been an amazing friend to me

19:33.560 --> 19:35.560
White Lightning

19:35.660 --> 19:39.655
Dude, enough practise lay-ups
I'm getting hoarse

19:40.060 --> 19:42.060
White Lightning...

19:42.160 --> 19:43.360
are you even listening to me?

19:43.460 --> 19:45.890
[JD] when you have something you
have to get off your chest

19:45.990 --> 19:47.990
There are a couple of things you can do

19:48.090 --> 19:49.890
You can test the water...

19:49.990 --> 19:52.175
check this out
I found it at a garage sale

19:52.275 --> 19:54.655
Oh my God that is disgusting

19:54.670 --> 19:56.880
Yeah I know I think so too

19:56.895 --> 20:01.400
I just wanted to make sure
we were on the same page...

20:04.045 --> 20:06.590

20:10.845 --> 20:12.845
That's what I'm talking about

20:12.945 --> 20:15.820

20:17.020 --> 20:19.045
[JD] of course if you're really
the number one doctor...

20:19.145 --> 20:22.145

keeping things to yourself

20:22.245 --> 20:25.475

20:25.490 --> 20:28.490
No Nothing else...
