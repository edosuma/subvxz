Cullen for this one.

00:17.022 --> 00:18.938
We looked into you, Mr. Cullen.

00:18.990 --> 00:20.690
It turns out, back in the early '90s,

00:20.775 --> 00:22.998
when you were starting
your real estate business,

00:23.023 --> 00:25.418
you were over-leveraged
and needed fast cash.

00:26.039 --> 00:27.831
So you borrowed money from Michael Lee,

00:28.210 --> 00:31.261
not knowing that he was just
the front man for the yakuza.

00:31.286 --> 00:33.670
STEVE: What you have done
recently is use your connections

00:33.695 --> 00:35.826
to recruit a couple of
military-trained hitters.

00:35.851 --> 00:37.484
You turned them loose onto Lee.

00:37.509 --> 00:38.591
It's a theory.

00:38.627 --> 00:40.043
I'm gonna bet on that theory.

Commander. You think you
got the whole picture.

You have no idea what's going on here.

00:44.933 --> 00:47.373

- No?
- Thank God for dog walkers.

06:44.695 --> 06:48.354

are, uh, suspect in general.

walk Eddie, and maybe one time

07:01.545 --> 07:02.711
you walk the dogs together.

- Yeah?

07:08.125 --> 07:12.198
No. No, I can't, actually,
'cause I'm tied up right now.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.940

be... No, he can be right there.

07:15.025 --> 07:16.558

07:16.670 --> 07:18.120

07:38.249 --> 07:40.110
he's still at the vet

07:40.134 --> 07:42.087
Well, let's just say that, uh,

07:42.112 --> 07:44.897
Steve and Eddie are no longer
allowed at the dog park.

07:44.922 --> 07:46.317

07:46.342 --> 07:49.378
Wow, look at you, early to

07:49.403 --> 07:51.570
you got a shiny new badge there,

07:51.595 --> 07:53.762

07:53.787 --> 07:55.491
This used to be you. What happened?

07:55.516 --> 07:56.849
Well, he graduated from rookie,

07:56.874 --> 07:58.994
so he no longer has
to be early or hopeful.

07:59.019 --> 08:01.069
Hey. I appreciate that. Thank you.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.105
You are very welcome.

08:03.157 --> 08:05.440
Okay, so 911 got a call last night

08:05.465 --> 08:07.301
about a potential kidnapping.

08:07.326 --> 08:09.551
Witness saw a teenager get
grabbed by two masked men

08:09.576 --> 08:11.457
in a van. I'm guessing the
van looked something like this.

08:11.610 --> 08:13.227
Yup. BOLO went out.

08:13.252 --> 08:15.144
Jogger called it in this
morning after seeing the blood,

08:15.169 --> 08:16.763
but when the officers
showed up, they found this.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.454
Uh-huh. Well, that's, uh,
that's a twist, isn't it?

08:19.507 --> 08:21.351
Okay, so if these are the
kidnappers, where's the girl?

08:21.375 --> 08:23.258
- No sign of her.
- All right, do we know who she is?

08:23.294 --> 08:25.355
Unfortunately, no. Witness
didn't get a good view of her.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.379
He just described her as
a teenager with dark hair,

08:27.464 --> 08:29.276
and there haven't been any
missing persons reports filed

08:29.300 --> 08:31.559
for a female of any description.

08:31.584 --> 08:34.469
Okay, what about these
guys? We get an ID on them?

08:34.554 --> 08:35.636
Two of them have records.

08:35.722 --> 08:37.602
One's currently on parole
for an assault charge.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.140
The other did time for armed robbery.

08:39.193 --> 08:40.308
The third guy's clean.

08:40.333 --> 08:42.705
It's his name that's on
the van's rental papers.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.325
He works as a doorman
at a condo building.

08:45.869 --> 08:49.037
Okay, so it's a ransom play.

08:49.169 --> 08:51.964
These guys pick up a girl
hoping for a quick payday.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.048
JUNIOR: That would
explain why the family

08:53.073 --> 08:55.135
wouldn't report her missing.
Kidnappers probably told them

08:55.159 --> 08:57.137
they'd kill her, you know,
if they got the cops involved.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.388
DANNY: All right, so we can assume

08:58.412 --> 09:00.221
maybe, uh, drop goes sideways,

09:00.246 --> 09:02.892
these guys end up dead,
girl gets away, hopefully,

09:02.917 --> 09:04.132
What about the parents?

09:04.168 --> 09:06.301
Yeah. Why didn't they
report it after the fact?

09:06.676 --> 09:08.531
Probably 'cause they
got something to hide.

09:09.192 --> 09:11.175
You know, this looks
like a professional hit.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.141
Clean head shots, no signs of struggle.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.142
Single shooter?

09:14.178 --> 09:15.322
Preliminary ballistics indicate

09:15.346 --> 09:17.262
that all kill shots came
from a single weapon.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.491
Right. So this is probably not

09:18.515 --> 09:19.626
a good Samaritan we're looking for.

09:19.650 --> 09:21.170
No, we're looking for a trained killer.

09:24.434 --> 09:26.168
(elevator bell dings)

09:26.193 --> 09:28.285
- (phone rings)

09:28.309 --> 09:29.620
How'd it go? Eddie needs stitches.

09:29.644 --> 09:30.976
I got to pick him up tonight.

09:31.062 --> 09:32.496
All right, I was talking
about the pretty doctor.

09:32.521 --> 09:34.446
I know what you meant. She liked you.

09:34.482 --> 09:36.649
She was at work. She
was being professional.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.192
- What do you want?
- What is with you?

09:38.217 --> 09:40.536
Why you got all these rules
when it comes to women?

09:40.621 --> 09:42.382
You're like the most reckless
human being on the planet Earth

09:42.406 --> 09:43.686
when it comes to everything else,

09:43.741 --> 09:45.385
but when it comes to
women, you got rules. Why?

09:45.409 --> 09:47.993
What is the problem with a measured,

09:48.079 --> 09:50.329
unhurried response to dating?

09:50.381 --> 09:51.692
Are you worried you're gonna strike out?

09:51.716 --> 09:53.110
'Cause you strike out,
you strike out again,

09:53.134 --> 09:54.811
you strike out a third time,
you might keep striking out,

09:54.835 --> 09:56.146
but you keep moving forward, that's it.

09:56.170 --> 09:57.670
You speaking from personal experience?

09:57.755 --> 10:00.339
I'm gonna tell you a little story.
It's a quick story. 11th grade.

10:00.424 --> 10:01.652
Senior prom was coming
up and I was obsessed

10:01.676 --> 10:03.592
with this girl named Maria Giordano.

10:03.678 --> 10:04.905
It was the end of the
year, so I had to hustle,

10:04.929 --> 10:06.729
so I-I made a quick move,

10:06.754 --> 10:08.671
I went ahead and broke
into the P.A. booth

10:08.696 --> 10:10.507
and I made an announcement
to the entire school.

10:10.532 --> 10:11.994
I said, "This is an emergency.

10:12.019 --> 10:14.236
And i-it's an emergency
for the nurse's office."

10:14.261 --> 10:15.510
The nurse's office?

10:15.535 --> 10:16.618
Yeah. The nurse's office.

10:16.824 --> 10:19.253
Okay? I said I-I need CPR immediately

10:19.278 --> 10:21.243
'cause Maria Giordano
took my breath away

10:21.268 --> 10:23.279
and if she didn't go to senior
prom with me, I was gonna die.

10:23.304 --> 10:24.637
You s... you did that?

10:24.662 --> 10:26.559
- Yeah, I did that.
- Did it work?

10:26.584 --> 10:28.109
No, it did not work. I, um...

10:28.336 --> 10:31.729
I was never spoken to ever
again by Maria Giordano,

10:31.754 --> 10:34.735
but her good friend Jenny Goldstein,
she thought it was hysterical,

10:34.759 --> 10:36.508
so I went with her. We had a great time.

10:36.533 --> 10:38.700
Yeah, I get it, Dan...
But for me, personally,

10:38.725 --> 10:41.042
I-I like to meet someone
and-and organically

10:41.067 --> 10:42.942
come to those feelings
between me and another person.

10:42.967 --> 10:44.216
You understand that?

10:44.301 --> 10:46.218
Without forcing it.
What's so bad about that?

10:46.303 --> 10:48.053
Nothing is-is bad about that.

10:48.078 --> 10:50.416
You and Eddie have a-a
beautiful relationship.

10:50.441 --> 10:53.420
Uh, you guys, u-uh, your
anniversary's coming up soon.

10:53.445 --> 10:54.528
(phone beeps off)

10:54.553 --> 10:56.220
Chief?

10:56.692 --> 10:57.980
Hung up on you, didn't he?

10:58.005 --> 10:59.571
He doesn't like goodbyes.

10:59.596 --> 11:00.983
- What's going on?
- ADAM: Okay, so,

11:01.016 --> 11:02.511
I dumped the kidnappers' phones.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.319
One of them called the
same number several times

11:04.344 --> 11:06.198
over the past 48 hours.

11:06.223 --> 11:07.317
Turns out it belongs

11:07.342 --> 11:10.199
to a client services rep at
a bank downtown who handles

11:10.224 --> 11:12.682
the bulk of their wire transfers
and foreign transactions.

11:12.707 --> 11:15.047
- GROVER: Uh-huh.
- HPD is bringing the guy in now.

11:15.082 --> 11:17.058
A banker who specializes in moving money

11:17.083 --> 11:18.361
gets involved with the kidnappers.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.306
- What do you think?
- GROVER: A story as old as time,

11:20.337 --> 11:21.587
my friend.

11:21.700 --> 11:23.032
Guy gets sick and tired of opening

11:23.057 --> 11:26.225
checking accounts all day,
develops himself a side hustle

11:26.250 --> 11:28.083
coordinating ransom money.

11:28.108 --> 11:30.299
QUINN: Okay, so if this is a
straight-up kidnap and ransom,

11:30.324 --> 11:32.241
the family is likely wealthy.

11:32.266 --> 11:33.906
Maybe they had their
own personal security

11:33.934 --> 11:36.018
handle the exchange
or they hired someone

11:36.043 --> 11:38.127
to get the girl back,
like a K&R consultant.

11:38.272 --> 11:39.966
GROVER: Well, a good
way to find out would be

11:39.990 --> 11:42.074
for us to figure out who this girl is.

11:42.254 --> 11:44.559
Sure hope that banker's
got an ID for us.

11:44.584 --> 11:47.696
I might have a lead on
that. CSU scrubbed the van.

11:47.721 --> 11:49.092
It was no help in terms of finding out

11:49.116 --> 11:51.166
who the kidnapping victim
was or who rescued her.

11:51.191 --> 11:53.095
It was a rental, so it
was covered head to toe

11:53.120 --> 11:55.587
in prints and DNA, none of
which were in the system.

11:55.623 --> 11:58.393
So, no lead at all. I'm sorry, 'cause...

11:58.418 --> 12:00.565
Patience, darling. Allow
me to get there.

12:00.590 --> 12:02.776
- 'Kay.
- The lab

12:02.801 --> 12:05.524
found fibers under the fingernails

12:05.549 --> 12:07.670
of the kidnappers; also, some of them

12:07.695 --> 12:09.528
were snagged on the bottom of the van.

12:09.553 --> 12:11.019
All red wool.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.596
None of the kidnappers
were wearing this fabric,

12:12.621 --> 12:14.617
so it likely came from the girl.

12:14.642 --> 12:15.774
Back up.

12:16.199 --> 12:18.227
Who in the hell wears wool in Hawaii?

12:18.252 --> 12:20.469
Nobody. Unless you're being forced to.

12:21.137 --> 12:22.291
QUINN: Private school.

12:22.343 --> 12:23.843
Goes with the rich girl theory.

12:23.878 --> 12:25.461
Yeah, so I looked into the school.

12:25.546 --> 12:27.129
It turns out it's within two miles

12:27.161 --> 12:29.912
from the site of the kidnapping.
Every girl that goes

12:29.937 --> 12:31.687
to this school has to wear

12:31.712 --> 12:33.990
a knee-length skirt made of...
You guessed it... red wool.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.106
After what happened to
this girl, there's no way

12:36.131 --> 12:37.390
she's turning up to class today.

12:37.414 --> 12:39.025
That's what I thought,
so I called the school.

12:39.093 --> 12:41.110
Turns out only five girls

12:41.135 --> 12:42.634
did not show up to class this morning.

12:42.670 --> 12:43.836
So it's a good lead.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.365
- Yeah.
- GROVER: Well, one of those five girls

12:45.389 --> 12:48.423
must be our kidnapping victim,
so we need to talk to them.

12:48.509 --> 12:50.939
Easy. I got the home
addresses of all the girls.

12:50.964 --> 12:52.404
We can work our way through the list.

12:52.429 --> 12:54.157
And by "we," he means "you."
Why don't you take Quinn,

12:54.181 --> 12:55.481
you guys go do... check it out.

12:55.576 --> 12:58.327
It would be my pleasure.
Sergeant Liu, I drive.

12:58.352 --> 12:59.738
Lead the way, Ms. Rey.

13:01.457 --> 13:02.832
TANI: I can't understand,

13:02.857 --> 13:04.227
if your daughter's kidnapped,

13:04.252 --> 13:06.669
why you wouldn't
immediately go to the police.

13:06.694 --> 13:08.277
Especially after you get her back.

13:09.543 --> 13:11.582
Well, maybe it wasn't
the parents' choice.

13:12.226 --> 13:14.643
So you're saying that maybe the girl

13:14.668 --> 13:16.613
wanted to keep the kidnapping a secret?

13:17.004 --> 13:17.949
Well...

13:19.605 --> 13:21.907
maybe it wasn't just a kidnapping.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.520
You know, she was in that van

13:25.262 --> 13:27.546
for over an hour with
three grown men, Tani.

13:27.631 --> 13:28.847
Yeah, I know. It's terrible.

13:28.883 --> 13:31.109
That's why I just, I can't imagine

13:31.134 --> 13:32.945
why you, why you wouldn't
want to come forward and...

13:32.970 --> 13:34.998
No, we can't imagine because
it didn't happen to us,

13:35.022 --> 13:38.041
so let's just stop trying to
guess what we would have done,

13:38.066 --> 13:40.149
or how we would have felt, so...

13:41.455 --> 13:44.006
(phone ringing)

13:44.757 --> 13:46.198
Hey, Lou, what's up?

13:46.223 --> 13:48.084
Well, I think we can make
your list a little bit shorter.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.401
We just talked to the banker.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.570
That was fast. Tough nut to crack?

13:51.595 --> 13:53.011
More like a soft-boiled egg.

13:53.157 --> 13:54.434
Guy's a nine-to-fiver who's never had

13:54.458 --> 13:55.741
so much as a speeding ticket.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.376
He got wrangled into the kidnapping plot

13:57.401 --> 13:59.053
by his cousin, the doorman,

13:59.078 --> 14:01.140
who grabbed the girl with
two of his lowlife friends.

14:01.165 --> 14:02.748
Now, the banker only had one job,

14:02.773 --> 14:05.861
and that was to make the ransom
money transfer untraceable,

14:05.886 --> 14:07.252
but they couldn't even do that.

14:07.277 --> 14:10.065
Before the three amigos could
execute that part of the plan,

14:10.090 --> 14:11.890
they themselves were executed.

14:12.359 --> 14:15.693
What? So the family didn't
even get the ransom call?

14:15.718 --> 14:18.435
How would they send
someone to rescue her?

14:18.626 --> 14:20.042
How did they know where she was?

14:20.067 --> 14:21.328
ADAM: The banker couldn't answer that.

14:21.352 --> 14:23.163
Swears he doesn't know
who the kidnap victim was.

14:23.187 --> 14:25.165
But check this out:
apparently, they chose the girl

14:25.189 --> 14:26.917
because she lives in the
same high-end building

14:26.941 --> 14:28.273
the doorman worked at.

14:28.298 --> 14:30.946
The address of that building
is 147 Lewers Street.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.421
Anybody on your list live there?

14:32.531 --> 14:36.154
Yes. A tenth grader by
the name of Yumi Chun.

14:36.427 --> 14:37.676
She's new to the school.

14:37.701 --> 14:39.618
She's only been there
a little over a month.

14:39.643 --> 14:41.780
Oh. Hell of a way to
start the school year.

14:49.356 --> 14:50.726
TANI: Yumi Chun?

14:50.751 --> 14:52.547
I'm Tani Rey, this is Quinn Liu.

14:52.694 --> 14:53.943
We're with Five-O.

14:54.390 --> 14:55.945
Do you mind if we come in?

14:56.624 --> 14:58.270
Okay.

14:58.305 --> 14:59.972
Thanks.

15:04.116 --> 15:05.454
Are your parents home?

15:05.479 --> 15:07.779
Um, they're out of town.

15:10.894 --> 15:12.394
Do you mind if we sit?

15:21.413 --> 15:22.890
TANI: Yumi, um,

15:22.915 --> 15:26.733
I'm-I'm sorry that we even
have to ask this, but...

15:27.689 --> 15:30.356
we need you to talk
to us about last night.

15:31.588 --> 15:33.655
We know what happened.

15:35.068 --> 15:38.848
We know that you were forced
into a van by three men.

15:38.873 --> 15:40.366
That must have been terrifying.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.325
And then coming back here all alone

15:43.350 --> 15:45.648
and being new to the school,

15:46.007 --> 15:47.927
you must have felt like
you couldn't talk to anyone about it.

15:47.952 --> 15:50.155
But I-I promise you, Yumi,

15:50.940 --> 15:52.606
keeping it a secret is worse.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.851
Nothing happened.

15:56.968 --> 15:59.135
I know it's hard to say it out loud.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.833
I get that, because it makes it real.

16:02.001 --> 16:04.006
What you survived last night,

16:04.953 --> 16:06.866
I'm sure you want to
just forget about it.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.577
I know this is hard, um,

16:11.795 --> 16:15.441
but the men that took you were murdered.

16:15.466 --> 16:17.280
And we want to find out who killed them.

16:18.073 --> 16:19.249
Yumi.

16:24.611 --> 16:25.944
Look at me.

16:28.051 --> 16:30.233
I'm sorry this happened to you.

16:31.205 --> 16:33.225
It is not your fault.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.545
And we are here to listen,

16:36.890 --> 16:39.391
and to help you in any way that we can.

16:41.247 --> 16:42.788
So, no pressure, okay?

16:46.796 --> 16:48.246
(elevator bell dings)

16:48.393 --> 16:49.475
Hey, Danny, Danny.

16:49.527 --> 16:52.111
CSU just finished their
ballistics analysis.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.280
Bullet trajectories and spatter
patterns indicate that the shots

16:54.304 --> 16:55.721
were all fired from the same angle:

16:55.816 --> 16:57.649
three feet off the
ground, inside the van.

16:57.674 --> 17:00.452
Same place where the red fibers
were found snagged on the floor.

17:00.616 --> 17:02.177
- Same place Yumi was sitting.
- Yeah.

17:02.202 --> 17:03.482
I don't think anyone rescued her.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.510
(phone ringing)

17:08.030 --> 17:10.128
Sorry. Adam, hey.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.780
Listen to me, it's possible that girl

17:11.805 --> 17:13.471
killed those men herself.

17:15.436 --> 17:16.970
Tani.

17:39.026 --> 17:41.193
(shouts, grunts)

17:41.218 --> 17:42.851
(grunts)

17:48.702 --> 17:50.678
Okay, thanks. HPD's
searching the neighborhood,

17:50.703 --> 17:51.985
but it looks like she got away.

17:52.010 --> 17:53.593
Updated Danny. Sent out a new BOLO.

17:53.618 --> 17:55.049
Turns out, Yumi was not
the innocent schoolgirl

17:55.074 --> 17:56.156
she was pretending to be.

17:56.181 --> 17:57.301
All right, let's take a lap,

17:57.326 --> 17:58.909
let's figure out who she really is.

18:09.118 --> 18:11.168
Well, this seems out of place.

18:22.164 --> 18:23.947
(grunts)

18:27.493 --> 18:29.827
Tani.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.413
Wow. Nice find.

18:36.633 --> 18:37.932
All right.

18:38.135 --> 18:40.752
A subcompact pistol...

18:42.148 --> 18:46.623
one, two, three different
types kinds of currency...

18:48.689 --> 18:50.054
four passports.

18:53.499 --> 18:56.194
Looks like Yumi Chun wasn't
this woman's only alias.

18:57.269 --> 19:00.053
QUINN: Meet the artist
formerly known as Yumi Chun.

19:00.105 --> 19:01.499
TANI: Seems before
she was in high school,

19:01.523 --> 19:04.671
she was an IT specialist
wanted for questioning in China.

19:04.860 --> 19:06.254
And before that, a software engineer

19:06.278 --> 19:07.778
who fled arrest in Germany.

19:07.803 --> 19:10.207
Yeah, I'll tell you something.
She's not a teenager.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.565
I mean, according to this résumé,

19:11.590 --> 19:13.507
she's at least mid-20s,
maybe even older.

19:13.532 --> 19:15.449
And not to mention her
biggest accomplishment:

19:15.654 --> 19:17.898
an Interpol Red Notice
she earned by being linked

19:17.923 --> 19:20.429
to a Malaysian data management
company called MalayStream.

19:20.454 --> 19:21.981
Why does that company sounds familiar?

19:22.006 --> 19:24.290
Maybe because it was accused
of leading an unsuccessful

19:24.315 --> 19:26.357
North Korean-sanctioned cyber attack

19:26.382 --> 19:28.460
on U.S. power grids a few years ago.

19:28.485 --> 19:30.554
GROVER: So this woman used to work
for the North Korean government.

19:30.579 --> 19:32.279
Now she lives in the U.S.

19:32.304 --> 19:33.882
Only one answer comes to mind.

19:33.907 --> 19:36.024
Yumi Chun is a North Korean spy.

19:36.049 --> 19:38.218
The whole schoolgirl alias was a cover.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.292
She fooled everyone.

19:39.317 --> 19:40.650
Yeah, including her kidnappers.

19:40.675 --> 19:42.820
Talk about bad luck choosing
a kidnap and ransom target.

19:42.845 --> 19:45.042
Okay, why be a
schoolgirl, though, right?

19:45.067 --> 19:46.951
There's a million things she
could have chose. Why that?

19:46.976 --> 19:48.820
That depends on the
mission that she's here for.

19:48.844 --> 19:52.194
We have to assume that every
single detail of her alias

19:52.219 --> 19:54.826
is all put in place so that
she can accomplish that mission.

19:54.850 --> 19:56.483
I'm talking about the age she chose,

19:56.519 --> 19:58.102
the school she enrolled in...

19:58.127 --> 19:59.176
And the friends she made.

19:59.201 --> 20:00.664
I mean, that private school,

20:00.689 --> 20:02.257
it is fancy. Elite.

20:02.637 --> 20:05.257
And a lot of powerful people
send their kids there...

20:06.195 --> 20:08.187
including people high
up in the military.

20:08.212 --> 20:10.197
So you're saying she chose
it to try and get close

20:10.222 --> 20:12.084
to the son or daughter of a
high-ranking military official?

20:12.168 --> 20:14.012
The easiest way to get
into the house of someone

20:14.036 --> 20:15.419
like that is to be invited.

20:15.444 --> 20:18.182
STEVE: All right, let's call
the school, see which students

20:18.207 --> 20:19.735
Yumi got close to,
find out if any of them

20:19.759 --> 20:21.041
have parents who serve.

20:21.066 --> 20:22.820
That's how we'll find her.

20:39.968 --> 20:41.648
Excuse me? Hi.

20:41.673 --> 20:43.508
I'm so sorry to do
this. My phone just died,

20:43.532 --> 20:45.065
and I really need to check my e-mails.

20:45.151 --> 20:46.545
Do you think I could use your laptop?

20:46.569 --> 20:49.536
Uh... yeah, sure. Of course.

20:49.632 --> 20:50.881
Here, go for it.

20:50.906 --> 20:53.140
I'm Gary, by the way. Jen.

20:53.795 --> 20:56.667
I was about to get another coffee.
Do you want anything?

20:56.692 --> 20:58.523
Really? I'd kill for a latte.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.131
You got it.

21:00.553 --> 21:01.936
Um, do your worst.

21:05.657 --> 21:07.657
_

21:09.470 --> 21:11.470
(beeping)

21:17.210 --> 21:19.721
I never met the girl. My
daughter Julie had her over

21:19.746 --> 21:20.995
a couple of nights ago,

21:21.020 --> 21:22.998
but I was out of town. I
just got back this morning.

21:23.022 --> 21:25.429
STEVE: Yeah, well, that
wasn't a coincidence.

21:25.454 --> 21:27.288
Look, we think that
Yumi enrolled in school

21:27.359 --> 21:30.110
to get close to your daughter
and get access to this house.

21:30.135 --> 21:32.455
And of course that's gonna be
easier when you're not in it.

21:33.101 --> 21:34.642
Good news. Sweep hasn't turned up

21:34.667 --> 21:36.617
- any surveillance equipment yet.
- Even if it did,

21:36.642 --> 21:38.609
I never discuss sensitive
information here.

21:38.754 --> 21:41.288
All she would've recorded
are arguments with my wife

21:41.313 --> 21:43.430
about the expensive dog
food she insists on buying.

21:43.455 --> 21:45.686
Major General, we... Not
for a minute do we question

21:45.711 --> 21:47.628
your discretion. This
woman has gone through

21:47.653 --> 21:49.102
a lot to get here, right?

21:49.181 --> 21:51.131
And it's because of
your position in the DOD.

21:51.156 --> 21:52.610
We just need to figure out why.

21:52.635 --> 21:53.800
TECH: We got something.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.366
This lamp is bugged.

21:59.391 --> 22:01.358
And I don't think it's
a listening device.

22:03.953 --> 22:05.539
It's a camera.
Wi-Fi-enabled.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.842
It's been transmitting
video since it was installed.

22:07.867 --> 22:10.200
Major General, where
do you use your laptop?

22:10.593 --> 22:12.296
MAJOR GENERAL AVEA:
Right below that lamp.

22:12.321 --> 22:14.401
Do you look at classified
information on that laptop?

22:15.184 --> 22:16.550
It's more than that.

22:16.635 --> 22:18.179
All the classified documents

22:18.204 --> 22:20.437
my security clearance
grants me access to

22:20.462 --> 22:23.130
are available through
my encrypted DOD account.

22:23.165 --> 22:25.110
Okay, I don't think that camera
was meant for your screen.

22:25.134 --> 22:26.394
I think it was meant for your keyboard,

22:26.418 --> 22:27.718
and if she has your password...

22:27.743 --> 22:28.743
She has everything.

22:28.768 --> 22:30.852
Did you log into that
account this morning?

22:30.877 --> 22:32.927
I did. About two hours ago.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.402
STEVE: All right. You calling CCIU?

22:34.426 --> 22:36.426
Yeah. Get the password revoked.

22:36.703 --> 22:38.489
Yeah, let's hope she hasn't used it yet.

22:38.514 --> 22:39.846
(typing)

22:44.049 --> 22:46.049
_

22:47.489 --> 22:49.406
Hey, careful. It's hot.

22:49.431 --> 22:51.969
Oh. Shoot. Did I not say iced?

22:51.994 --> 22:53.614
Oh. My bad.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.055
Um, I'll get you another one.

22:55.080 --> 22:57.080
Oh, you're sweet, Gary, thanks.

23:04.180 --> 23:06.180
_

23:09.538 --> 23:11.850
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold
on, you're going the wrong way.

23:11.874 --> 23:13.674
Come with me. Here's the bad news.

23:13.709 --> 23:16.377
CID cyber crime unit
just called me to tell me

23:16.402 --> 23:18.428
that Yumi accessed
Avea's encrypted account

23:18.453 --> 23:20.279
before we disabled the password.

23:20.304 --> 23:22.771
Great. So the spy got her hand
into the classified cookie jar.

23:22.897 --> 23:25.614
- What's the good news?
- Good news? There ain't no good news.

23:25.639 --> 23:27.083
Because they don't know what she took.

23:27.108 --> 23:29.225
The girl is a pro, man.
She covered her tracks.

23:29.258 --> 23:31.058
- It's gonna take time.
- Yeah, time we don't have.

23:31.083 --> 23:32.549
She's moving fast. We need to know

23:32.574 --> 23:34.825
what her next move is gonna
be if we want to catch up.

23:35.009 --> 23:36.559
You think we need to rustle up Jerry?

23:36.584 --> 23:38.834
Aw, I don't know,
man. If CID hit a wall,

23:38.859 --> 23:40.286
then Jerry's gonna hit a wall for sure.

23:40.311 --> 23:41.338
But I talked to McGarrett...

23:41.363 --> 23:42.696
I take it he had an idea?

23:42.721 --> 23:44.688
Yeah, and you're not gonna like it.

23:44.992 --> 23:46.162
Oh...

23:46.186 --> 23:48.654
_

23:49.295 --> 23:50.461
(lock buzzes)

23:50.486 --> 23:52.771
Man, you're looking kind
of rough up in here, Daddy.

23:52.796 --> 23:53.761
(chuckles)

23:54.717 --> 23:56.218
You should really get out more.

23:56.243 --> 23:58.126
You know, vitamin D
could do you some good.

23:58.151 --> 24:01.006
Pass. Skin cancer is a silent killer.

24:01.197 --> 24:02.696
Boy, who you think you're fooling?

24:03.545 --> 24:05.926
We know good and well
that living in the hole

24:05.951 --> 24:09.069
has got you going out
of your rabbit-ass mind.

24:09.584 --> 24:10.491
Hardly.

24:11.006 --> 24:12.827
It's good for the soul
to get away, you know?

24:12.852 --> 24:14.485
Get some quality, uh, me time in.

24:14.631 --> 24:16.881
Well, I bet you I know
what me ain't getting

24:16.906 --> 24:18.787
up in Casa Del Solitude...

24:19.423 --> 24:22.451
caramel double shot cappuccinos.

24:22.747 --> 24:23.779
It's all yours

24:23.804 --> 24:25.254
if you do us a little favor.

24:25.514 --> 24:28.006
Yeah? Let me guess.

24:28.031 --> 24:30.918
That tiny little baby favor
has something to do with

24:30.953 --> 24:32.247
national security and comes along

24:32.272 --> 24:33.988
with a nice ticking clock?

24:34.013 --> 24:37.487
Oh, come on, now. Go big or
go home, baby.

24:37.512 --> 24:38.853
Did I say "home"?

24:39.216 --> 24:40.961
Mm. I meant to say "hole."

24:41.013 --> 24:42.802
Go big or go hole.

24:43.265 --> 24:47.217
- Go hole. Yeah.
- What's Jerry up to? Hot date?

24:48.044 --> 24:49.534
Oh...

24:49.559 --> 24:51.726
so you're desperate.

24:52.864 --> 24:54.114
Love it.

24:54.224 --> 24:56.903
Well, if that's the case,
you know the drill, fellas.

24:57.106 --> 24:59.521
I'm not helping you out unless
I'm guaranteed a transfer

24:59.608 --> 25:02.126
to a minimum-security facility
with furlough privileges.

25:02.548 --> 25:04.021
Deal?

25:06.459 --> 25:08.459
Nah, we good. Bye forever.

25:10.126 --> 25:11.458
(knocks) Wait!

25:13.474 --> 25:15.758
I'm about to lose a lot
of respect for myself here.

25:15.783 --> 25:17.416
(chuckles)

25:18.823 --> 25:20.231
We're okay with that.

25:21.748 --> 25:22.964
Lou, talk to us.

25:22.989 --> 25:23.989
Uh, hang on.

25:24.372 --> 25:27.256
All right, according to Mr. Wright,

25:27.476 --> 25:29.343
the major general's account was

25:29.368 --> 25:32.146
accessed just a few minutes
before we revoked the password.

25:32.666 --> 25:34.499
She used an IP address

25:34.660 --> 25:36.477
that traces back to a coffee shop

25:36.502 --> 25:39.253
in Waikiki called "Coffee Talk."

25:39.278 --> 25:41.465
Well, seeing as she didn't grab a laptop

25:41.490 --> 25:42.834
before throwing herself off the balcony,

25:42.859 --> 25:44.333
I'm guessing she went
there looking for one.

25:44.358 --> 25:46.108
You're welcome, by the way.

25:46.133 --> 25:47.716
Oh, and I'm fine. How are you guys?

25:47.741 --> 25:49.769
All right, Junior, call HPD,
have them send a unit over

25:49.794 --> 25:51.653
to this coffee shop, see if you
can figure out which computer

25:51.678 --> 25:53.094
- Yumi was using.
- On it.

25:53.692 --> 25:55.813
Can you tell what
documents she accessed?

25:55.838 --> 25:58.038
Well, hello. Is that a fresh voice

25:58.063 --> 26:00.466
I'm hearing? A new recruit, perhaps?

26:00.491 --> 26:02.342
TANI: Oh, our apologies.

26:02.367 --> 26:04.283
Quinn Liu, meet homicidal oil slick

26:04.308 --> 26:06.547
- Aaron Wright.
- A nickname.

26:06.715 --> 26:08.015
That's how you know you're in.

26:08.040 --> 26:10.090
Can you tell them
jokes with a broken jaw?

26:10.115 --> 26:11.647
I'm sending you my screen right now.

26:12.317 --> 26:13.831
All right. What is this?

26:13.856 --> 26:15.534
All the classified documents
that she downloaded.

26:15.558 --> 26:17.057
That's a lot of American secrets.

26:17.082 --> 26:18.142
About ten terabytes' worth.

26:18.167 --> 26:19.466
Spy girl was not messing around.

26:19.491 --> 26:20.873
Strange, none of these documents

26:20.898 --> 26:22.006
seem particularly relevant

26:22.031 --> 26:23.208
to North Korea's national interest.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.887
Yeah, like she raided his account

26:24.912 --> 26:26.244
without anything specific in mind.

26:26.269 --> 26:27.768
Well, come on. She was in a hurry.

26:27.793 --> 26:29.130
Don't you think she'd
just smash and grab

26:29.155 --> 26:30.298
and get the hell out of there?

26:30.322 --> 26:31.466
QUINN: Sure, but that's actually

26:31.490 --> 26:32.435
what's bothering me.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.036
I mean, this woman's
been an agent for years,

26:34.061 --> 26:36.138
so if all she needed were
credentials to raid the DOD,

26:36.162 --> 26:37.130
she could have done it already.

26:37.155 --> 26:38.606
Yeah, she could have
done it from anywhere.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.216
Right? But she chose here.

26:40.241 --> 26:44.091
She went to a lot of trouble
to embed herself here on Oahu.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.720
- I think this is a haystack.
- DANNY: I'm sorry.

26:46.755 --> 26:49.067
Did you mean to say "haystack,"
or is something wrong with you?

26:49.092 --> 26:51.893
No. See, she downloads a
haystack to hide a needle.

26:51.988 --> 26:54.155
That's the one piece of
intelligence she's looking for.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.161
- Ah.
- So, if the intelligence was not

26:56.186 --> 26:58.677
about our military's
plans for North Korea...

26:59.497 --> 27:00.851
Then maybe it was about something

27:00.876 --> 27:03.427
North Korea was looking
for on Oahu. Wright?

27:03.903 --> 27:05.966
Oh, are we talking now?

27:06.052 --> 27:08.052
Shut up. Do a keyword search...

27:08.077 --> 27:09.610
"North Korea" and "Oahu."

27:09.635 --> 27:11.218
Look at most recent documents first.

27:11.341 --> 27:12.590
As part of her sweep,

27:12.615 --> 27:14.676
she downloaded personnel
files of intelligence assets.

27:14.700 --> 27:18.062
Now one of them was updated
two months ago under a new name.

27:18.087 --> 27:19.203
Whose name?

27:19.228 --> 27:20.944
"Jae-Sung Dai."

27:20.969 --> 27:23.503
North Korean defector
who is now living here

27:23.528 --> 27:26.362
on the island using his
new alias, "Sam Hong."

27:26.565 --> 27:29.065
Looks like he was recently debriefed.

27:29.275 --> 27:30.941
It says here he is responsible

27:30.966 --> 27:33.245
for one of the most successful
mass escapes from North Korea

27:33.269 --> 27:34.544
in modern history.

27:34.569 --> 27:37.137
He got out with at least five families.

27:37.162 --> 27:40.280
They fled to Northeast China,
and Dai defected to the U.S.

27:40.305 --> 27:41.263
Five families.

27:41.288 --> 27:42.420
I mean, he's a hero.

27:42.645 --> 27:43.944
STEVE: No. I mean, yes, he is,

27:43.979 --> 27:45.112
but not to them.

27:45.137 --> 27:47.020
To them, he's a traitor.

27:47.349 --> 27:49.543
And they sent her here to look for him.

27:49.568 --> 27:50.901
This is it. He's the needle.

27:50.926 --> 27:53.510
I'll call CID... Send
all units to his address.

27:53.656 --> 27:55.669
All right, Tani, call HPD.

27:55.694 --> 27:57.241
Dispatch them out, and you and Junior go

27:57.266 --> 27:58.853
with them. Make sure we get that guy

27:58.878 --> 28:00.827
out of this building
before she gets there.

28:05.856 --> 28:07.978
(tires squeal)

28:08.003 --> 28:09.920
(engine revving)

28:14.977 --> 28:16.817
(tires squealing)

28:17.841 --> 28:19.099
Let's go.

28:23.419 --> 28:25.278
Go, go, go.

28:41.367 --> 28:44.201
Sir, go back inside
and lock your door now.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.520
(officers speaking indistinctly)

29:04.904 --> 29:06.904
(latch clicks, hinges squeak)

29:11.527 --> 29:13.811
(light clatter)

29:23.539 --> 29:25.289
(grunting)

29:47.519 --> 29:48.902
(grunts)

30:03.730 --> 30:05.203
My phone.

30:15.561 --> 30:17.107
Jae-Sung, annyeong.

30:17.132 --> 30:18.598
(siren approaching)

30:21.621 --> 30:23.071
(tires screech)

30:24.523 --> 30:26.907
Looks like CID beat us here.

30:31.584 --> 30:33.584
So did she.

30:38.393 --> 30:40.143
(elevator chimes)

30:43.236 --> 30:44.452
(chimes)

30:46.829 --> 30:48.829
(chimes, dings)

30:49.532 --> 30:51.430
Drop your weapon now or I'll shoot!

30:51.455 --> 30:53.626
That wouldn't be in your
best interest, Officer Rey.

30:53.651 --> 30:56.063
You might be aware I've come into
some sensitive information.

30:56.115 --> 30:57.672
Special forces movement,

30:57.697 --> 30:58.899
location of hidden bases,

30:58.924 --> 31:00.841
internal memos on detainees

31:00.866 --> 31:02.198
held by U.S.-operated black sites.

31:02.311 --> 31:05.679
All of it is currently
on a timed release online.

31:05.704 --> 31:08.158
In less than 30 minutes, it
will be uploaded to the dark web

31:08.183 --> 31:10.350
for any American enemy who wants it.

31:10.375 --> 31:12.422
And as we all know, there are many.

31:12.447 --> 31:13.757
And you're the only
one that can stop it.

31:13.782 --> 31:15.082
And for that, you want something.

31:15.107 --> 31:16.323
That sound about right?

31:16.348 --> 31:18.336
Get the two of us on a
plane back to our country.

31:18.360 --> 31:19.409
Simple as that.

31:19.434 --> 31:21.133
So he can be tortured and executed?

31:21.246 --> 31:23.697
A small price to pay to
keep your country safe.

31:23.722 --> 31:25.138
Wouldn't you say?

31:30.243 --> 31:31.852
I'll admit, I didn't think you'd make

31:31.877 --> 31:33.021
the right decision, Commander.

31:33.046 --> 31:34.212
STEVE: The right decision?

31:34.237 --> 31:35.829
Because before you told
me I only had one choice.

31:35.854 --> 31:38.874
Yes, but frankly, I'm not
convinced you believe that.

31:38.892 --> 31:40.308
So let me be clear.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.537
The only way I stop
those classified documents

31:42.562 --> 31:44.178
from going live is while on a plane

31:44.203 --> 31:45.619
bound for North Korea.

31:45.644 --> 31:47.227
Any deviation from this plan,

31:47.252 --> 31:49.636
and I will kill the
defector without hesitation.

31:50.374 --> 31:51.740
(phone beeps off)

31:51.765 --> 31:53.243
How far are away from
the airfield are they?

31:53.550 --> 31:55.300
Uh, I don't know. About six minutes.

31:55.325 --> 31:58.326
Did you tell her that the
plane's not going in the air?

31:58.471 --> 32:00.338
- I may have left that part out.
- Uh-huh.

32:00.363 --> 32:02.091
Let's hope our gamble pays
off before they get there.

32:02.116 --> 32:03.365
Tani, Junior, talk to me.

32:03.390 --> 32:04.969
TANI: We're in position.

32:06.369 --> 32:08.619
STEVE: Lou, where are we at
with the computer Yumi used?

32:08.707 --> 32:11.274
HPD just dropped it off.
Wright's working on it right now.

32:11.299 --> 32:12.540
I found the dark web portal

32:12.565 --> 32:13.898
where Yumi set the timed release.

32:14.043 --> 32:15.771
She must've been working fast,
because she left breadcrumbs

32:15.795 --> 32:16.844
right to a backdoor.

32:16.930 --> 32:17.940
I can probably disable it,

32:17.964 --> 32:18.879
but I'm gonna need some time.

32:18.965 --> 32:20.264
Time? We don't have time.

32:20.300 --> 32:21.493
They're almost at the airfield.

32:21.517 --> 32:23.050
Yeah, okay, I get it.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.106
Right. Mm-hmm. I got
five minutes to hack this,

32:25.131 --> 32:26.831
or Jae-something dies

32:26.856 --> 32:28.284
a horrible death and
our national security

32:28.308 --> 32:30.641
is compromised on a global
scale. "You hear me, Wright?"

32:30.666 --> 32:33.073
- Mm-hmm.
- I get it.

32:33.625 --> 32:36.903
And since the fate of the world
isn't enough to motivate you,

32:36.928 --> 32:39.178
why don't we give you a
little something that might?

32:39.203 --> 32:40.962
If you can't stop this document dump,

32:40.987 --> 32:43.133
that means you're not as good
a hacker as we thought you were,

32:43.158 --> 32:45.383
which makes you pretty
much useless to us.

32:45.408 --> 32:47.493
And then we're leaving here
and we're never coming back.

32:47.533 --> 32:50.248
You understand? That means
we'll be the last human contact

32:50.273 --> 32:53.008
you ever have in your
entire wasted life,

32:53.033 --> 32:55.266
and that coffee that the
floor's drinking right now,

32:55.478 --> 32:57.278
well, that'll be the
last thing you ever taste

32:57.303 --> 33:00.504
that ain't lukewarm
and suspiciously lumpy.

33:03.509 --> 33:05.243
You paint a vivid picture.

33:06.087 --> 33:07.920
I'm not getting on that plane.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.524
- _
- _

33:09.548 --> 33:11.548
- _
- _

33:12.166 --> 33:14.166
_

33:14.520 --> 33:15.520
Boss, they're talking.

33:15.605 --> 33:16.665
I'm gonna patch the
comms through to you.

33:16.689 --> 33:18.272
- All right.
- (Jae-Sung speaking Korean)

33:19.530 --> 33:21.079
Patch through a translator, also?

33:21.104 --> 33:22.653
They know each other.

33:23.391 --> 33:24.852
- What, you speak Mandarin and Korean?
- (shushes)

33:24.876 --> 33:26.876
_

33:26.900 --> 33:28.900
_

33:28.924 --> 33:30.924
_

33:31.440 --> 33:34.024
_

33:35.344 --> 33:37.344
_

33:38.177 --> 33:39.960
They were friends. They worked together.

33:40.107 --> 33:42.461
This isn't just about her
coming to get a defector?

33:42.486 --> 33:43.985
No. It's personal.

33:44.032 --> 33:47.415
_

33:48.196 --> 33:49.368
_

33:49.392 --> 33:50.797
_

33:51.133 --> 33:56.657
_

33:57.313 --> 33:59.891
- Jae-Sung's stopping the car.
- Boss?

34:00.157 --> 34:02.157
_

34:02.446 --> 34:03.961
_

34:03.992 --> 34:05.992
_

34:06.155 --> 34:07.383
Steve, she's giving him an ultimatum.

34:07.407 --> 34:09.126
- She's threatening to kill him.
- Boss?

34:09.150 --> 34:11.270
Hold your fire. Until Wright
can stop the document release,

34:11.293 --> 34:13.389
she's the only other person
who can. Wright, talk to me.

34:13.414 --> 34:14.532
I'm not there yet.

34:14.556 --> 34:16.282
_

34:18.571 --> 34:19.987
He's running!

34:29.288 --> 34:31.338
TANI: Drop your weapon!

34:33.181 --> 34:34.398
Drop it!

34:43.842 --> 34:45.376
Yumi's down.

34:46.344 --> 34:47.672
Hey.

34:47.697 --> 34:49.085
It's over.

34:49.399 --> 34:50.899
Hey. Yeah.

34:52.418 --> 34:54.418
(grunts)

34:57.329 --> 35:00.040
Wright, tell me you
disabled the document dump.

35:00.065 --> 35:02.399
You have less than ten seconds.

35:03.633 --> 35:05.963
Steve, I don't think he's gonna make it.

35:05.988 --> 35:07.383
- He's not gonna be able...
- Wait, wait, wait.

35:07.408 --> 35:09.008
That's it. I'm in.

35:09.328 --> 35:10.889
- Timed release has been stopped.
- (exhales)

35:11.069 --> 35:12.435
Stopped? You're sure?

35:12.747 --> 35:14.969
Well, it says, you
know, "upload canceled."

35:15.710 --> 35:17.602
That's usually a good sign, so, uh...

35:18.456 --> 35:19.788
yeah.

35:24.367 --> 35:25.751
You play too much.

35:26.579 --> 35:29.160
Look at me. Now I'm the
one stopping a bad guy

35:29.185 --> 35:30.551
from getting away on a plane.

35:30.716 --> 35:32.436
I think this deserves

35:32.461 --> 35:34.375
a change of scenery, fellas.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.151
Well, Aaron, I'm gonna
give you a life lesson.

35:37.176 --> 35:38.959
It ain't about where you end up.

35:38.984 --> 35:42.443
Life is about the friends
you make along the way.

35:42.468 --> 35:45.002
Or didn't make, in your case.

35:45.027 --> 35:47.448
(chuckles) Oh, uh, by the way?

35:47.533 --> 35:48.983
The coffee was decaf.

35:49.008 --> 35:50.422
Ha!

35:53.080 --> 35:54.438
(door closes)

36:00.086 --> 36:01.879
Try to keep him from running,

36:01.904 --> 36:04.297
and make sure those stitches stay dry.

36:04.857 --> 36:06.894
All righty. No playing and no swimming.

36:06.919 --> 36:08.669
- I'll break it to him gently.
- (chuckles)

36:08.701 --> 36:09.954
Hope he behaved himself,

36:09.979 --> 36:11.985
unlike my partner this morning. Oh.

36:12.010 --> 36:13.675
Oh, Eddie was a perfect gentleman.

36:13.699 --> 36:15.533
Okay. Well, that's great.

36:15.558 --> 36:16.902
That's great. You hear that, Eddie?

36:16.927 --> 36:19.047
Good boy, Eddie. Oh, um...

36:20.592 --> 36:21.946
Uh...

36:23.039 --> 36:24.456
(stammering): Uh, it's nothing.

36:24.627 --> 36:25.759
Uh, good.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.901
(Eddie whining)

36:27.926 --> 36:29.218
- It's all good?
- Yeah.

36:29.243 --> 36:32.180
- So, uh, if there's nothing, I'll just...
- Okay, thank you. Appreciate it.

36:32.205 --> 36:34.016
Okay. Thank you.

36:37.925 --> 36:39.925
(Eddie whines)

36:40.702 --> 36:41.951
(sighs)

36:42.052 --> 36:44.052
All right, buddy.

36:46.649 --> 36:48.460
What do you say? You want
to go get something to eat?

36:48.484 --> 36:50.401
- (groans)
- Why you looking in there?

36:50.486 --> 36:51.790
Huh?

36:53.122 --> 36:55.122
Don't-don't look at me
like that. I like her, too.

36:55.147 --> 36:56.707
All right, buddy? But
I don't think Th...

36:56.732 --> 36:58.561
I don't think the feeling's mutual.

36:58.586 --> 37:00.661
- (moans)
- What?

37:01.102 --> 37:03.891
I know what you're doing.
You're conspiring with Danny.

37:03.923 --> 37:05.473
- (whines)
- I see what you're doing.

37:05.551 --> 37:07.696
Well, what do you want me to do?
Just... you want me to just go

37:07.720 --> 37:10.137
in there and-and get shot down
in front of all those people?

37:10.751 --> 37:12.900
Nope, it's not gonna work.

37:12.925 --> 37:14.308
I'm telling you,

37:14.333 --> 37:15.699
I don't need that in my life.

37:15.724 --> 37:17.607
I got a very full social life.

37:17.632 --> 37:19.466
I-I... it's very rich.

37:19.710 --> 37:21.826
Danny's projecting, okay?

37:21.851 --> 37:23.851
(low growl)

37:26.376 --> 37:29.110
He's also right, 'cause I'm
sitting here talking to a dog.

37:29.635 --> 37:30.718
Whatever. Okay, fine.

37:30.743 --> 37:32.743
He's right. Danny's right. Okay.

37:34.053 --> 37:35.102
(barks)

37:39.680 --> 37:41.262
Just wait here, all right?

37:41.287 --> 37:43.454
Wait... just wait here. Wait.

37:43.479 --> 37:44.778
(grumbles)

37:54.856 --> 37:55.856
Hey.

37:56.110 --> 37:57.015
Hey.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.385
Did you have another question?

37:58.471 --> 38:01.722
Oh, no. It can wait. That's fine.

38:10.643 --> 38:12.927
It's fine. What is it?

38:15.785 --> 38:16.847
You really... you...

38:16.872 --> 38:18.216
Hi. You're really gonna make me say this

38:18.240 --> 38:20.574
say this in front of e-everybody? Huh?

38:21.042 --> 38:22.386
I really am.

38:22.964 --> 38:24.378
Okay. Uh,

38:24.403 --> 38:26.937
Dr. Okino, uh,

38:26.962 --> 38:29.880
would you like to go to
dinner with me sometime?

38:31.978 --> 38:34.896
♪ ♪

38:40.179 --> 38:41.120
And?

38:41.847 --> 38:43.457
And I got a date.

38:43.482 --> 38:44.839
Great.

38:46.245 --> 38:47.244
What is that?

38:47.269 --> 38:49.069
(laughing): It's-it's, um, I'm...

38:49.094 --> 38:50.793
I'm really happy for you.

38:50.818 --> 38:52.512
- That's all.
- What, you-you wanted her to say no?

38:52.537 --> 38:53.834
- Is that... ?
- No. No, no.

38:53.859 --> 38:54.969
I-I just... I...

38:54.994 --> 38:56.672
Personally, though, I
don't want you to miss out

38:56.697 --> 38:59.581
on the vital human experience
of being rejected by a stranger.

38:59.665 --> 39:00.892
- You know?
- Dude, you're unbelievable.

39:00.916 --> 39:02.556
You wanted me to get
a date, I got a date.

39:02.585 --> 39:04.625
I'm-I'm very happy that you
got a date, okay?

39:04.649 --> 39:06.649
- Uh-huh. - Very, very
happy. And, more importantly,

39:06.674 --> 39:08.472
my plan worked, so I'm very
happy about that, too.

39:08.497 --> 39:10.958
Oh. Okay, you want the
credit? You can have it.

39:10.983 --> 39:13.020
You can have the vet
bill, too. How about that?

39:13.410 --> 39:14.298
So?

39:14.323 --> 39:16.273
So what?

39:16.298 --> 39:18.182
You know, how'd it go?

39:18.217 --> 39:20.050
(clears throat) You
had to tell everybody?

39:20.075 --> 39:22.125
I didn't... I didn't have
to tell anybody anything.

39:22.221 --> 39:24.638
I chose to. Uh, and it-it worked out.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.033
He-he got a date. All right.

39:26.058 --> 39:27.691
- ADAM (chuckles): Hey.
- GROVER: Hey!

39:27.727 --> 39:29.931
Congrats, man. Way
to get back out there.

39:29.956 --> 39:32.373
Hey, this man ought to know.

39:32.398 --> 39:34.198
How-How's Tamiko, by the way?

39:34.233 --> 39:35.816
Oh, hey, you know, I don't...

39:35.841 --> 39:38.212
I don't want to steal the
spotlight from Steve here.

39:38.237 --> 39:39.703
Please have the spotlight.

39:39.739 --> 39:42.322
Well, lookee here. If it
ain't Miss Rosetta Stone.

39:42.347 --> 39:43.262
Ah. (chuckles)

39:43.287 --> 39:44.453
How's that for a first day?

39:44.478 --> 39:46.020
Well, let's see.

39:46.045 --> 39:48.791
I got my ass kicked by a
North Korean secret agent

39:48.816 --> 39:50.474
and then translated

39:50.499 --> 39:51.891
the hostage taking

39:51.916 --> 39:53.227
of some of America's
most dangerous secrets.

39:53.252 --> 39:55.169
- DANNY: Good.
- And usually on the first day,

39:55.194 --> 39:56.981
I'm just, uh, figuring
out the coffee machine.

39:57.006 --> 39:58.200
Today was actually pretty laid-back,

39:58.224 --> 39:59.224
all things considered.

39:59.258 --> 40:01.245
And we don't have a coffee machine.

40:01.710 --> 40:02.710
You're kidding.

40:03.454 --> 40:04.855
But you're still in?

40:07.169 --> 40:08.702
I am so in.

40:08.727 --> 40:10.244
- Yes!
- STEVE: Cheers to that!

40:10.269 --> 40:12.352
- Yes!
- That's what I'm talking about.

40:12.377 --> 40:14.023
(all cheering)

40:15.305 --> 40:21.871
