00:02.160 --> 00:03.491
This season on Arrow...

00:03.680 --> 00:07.844
<i>The only way I know how to fight
the darkness is to be darkness.</i>

00:08.080 --> 00:10.162
And I don't wanna be
that type of person anymore.

00:10.440 --> 00:11.362
<i>I'm running for mayor.</i>

00:11.600 --> 00:14.763
And I promise you that I will never
stop fighting to save this city.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.610
<i>So, you're all fretting
about this city dying.</i>

00:16.800 --> 00:20.486
<i>I'm here on behalf of an organization
that wants you to let it die.</i>

00:20.680 --> 00:21.681
I'm Damien Darhk.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.170
<i>The type of magic he's using,</i>

00:24.360 --> 00:26.681
<i>I've seen it take good people
and turn them dark.</i>

00:26.960 --> 00:30.965
If I don't make it off this island,
you will go to Russia and find my parents.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.887
<i>If Darhk wins,
Laurel died for nothing.</i>

00:34.120 --> 00:36.885
If you can channel light and hope,

00:37.120 --> 00:39.646
<i>you will be able to repel Darhk's magic.</i>

00:40.560 --> 00:42.642
- Do you remember what I promised you?
- A new beginning.

00:42.800 --> 00:46.009
Darhk plans to burn the world
in a nuclear fire.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.690
I'm assuming you know what Rubicon is.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.882
And I'm assuming
it's under Mr. Darhk's control.

00:50.120 --> 00:53.363
Every NATO ally, Rubicon has control
over all their nuclear systems.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.527
<i>You mean HIVE does.</i>

00:54.720 --> 00:56.051
<i>If even one of those nukes hits...</i>

00:56.320 --> 00:57.401
<i>He'll be unstoppable.</i>

00:57.640 --> 00:58.687
- I think it worked.
- It worked.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.723
Rubicon's offline.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.526
<i>"DARHK". Do you need a moment?</i>

01:03.720 --> 01:05.688
No? Good.
'Cause I need you to do me a favor.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.325
Go to hell.

01:09.080 --> 01:10.411
Why bother?

01:10.640 --> 01:12.483
I'm going to bring it to us.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.683
- Get the hell out of here.
- Mom. Stop.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.207
- Oh, my God!
- Mom, get back!

01:20.400 --> 01:22.767
This is your mother? Oh, goodie.

01:23.520 --> 01:24.851
On!

01:25.320 --> 01:27.687
Persuading you to help me is
gonna be easier than I thought.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.166
Helping you do what?

01:29.320 --> 01:30.560
Your underground city's
already been destroyed.

01:30.760 --> 01:31.727
I'm still going forward.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.400
<i>So, what, you kill my mother
if I don't help you destroy the world?</i>

01:34.600 --> 01:36.568
Newsflash, my mother lives in the world.

01:36.760 --> 01:40.685
Dying instantaneously in nuclear fire,
rather painless.

01:40.880 --> 01:44.282
And then there's having your life-force
slowly sucked out like this...

01:45.680 --> 01:47.091
9h, my God! Mom!

01:48.400 --> 01:49.606
What's it gonna be, Ms. Smoak?

01:57.600 --> 02:00.524
Look, I know you don't live here anymore,
but those were nice windows.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.883
So unoriginal.

02:05.120 --> 02:09.091
I'm now powered by the deaths
of tens of thousands of souls.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.806
There is nothing you can do to stop me.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.487
Or should I say, us.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.007
<i>Stop!</i>

02:49.240 --> 02:52.449
You let them go, or I kill your daughter.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.007
You think I'm bluffing?

02:58.480 --> 02:59.686
(%GRUNTS) %GROANS)

02:59.920 --> 03:01.081
Let my daughter go.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.440
It's okay, sweetheart.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.281
Everything's gonna be all right.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.361
You okay?

03:13.600 --> 03:15.011
When did this become your life?

03:15.200 --> 03:16.611
Oh, my God.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.125
Oh, my God, it's gone.
He took it. It's gone.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.282
- What's gone?
- The laptop with the anti-Rubicon program.

03:25.440 --> 03:26.441
If Darhk has that...

03:26.640 --> 03:29.041
He can launch all of
the world's nuclear missiles.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.120
Looks like internal bleeding.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.806
And possible broken ribs.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.080
Hemothorax.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.171
We have to relieve the pressure. Thea.

03:51.160 --> 03:53.367
Felicity, we need you at your station.
We have to stop Rubicon.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.684
Is he gonna be okay?

04:01.320 --> 04:02.401
Put the gun down, Reiter.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.081
Ahh!

04:05.720 --> 04:07.210
You think you can kill me, Ms. Venediktov?

04:07.400 --> 04:08.890
I'm going to kill you!

04:09.080 --> 04:10.764
You'll only kill yourself in the attempt.

04:11.560 --> 04:15.610
Without these runes, the idol's power
would overwhelm my mind.

04:16.040 --> 04:19.249
I don't care. It's worth it to stop you.

04:19.519 --> 04:20.601
You see that, Reiter?

04:21.519 --> 04:24.922
That plane filled with all of those people
you were keeping prisoner?

04:25.240 --> 04:27.004
They're getting away. This is over.

04:27.240 --> 04:32.087
It's not all of them, Mr. Queen.
The plane is too small, and it's not over.

04:35.680 --> 04:39.127
All those deaths.
They give me power. And her...

04:41.040 --> 04:42.041
Only madness.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.091
How is he?

04:47.280 --> 04:49.362
Well, he's stable. John said the next
30 minutes should tell us...

04:49.520 --> 04:51.648
- Whether or not he'll make it.
- Yeah.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.770
Hey, can I ask you something?
I know it might not be the best time.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.564
Back at our place... My place, the...

04:56.760 --> 04:57.727
The place, the loft...

04:57.920 --> 04:58.921
Yeah?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.562
Darhk's magic, it worked on you.
I thought...

05:01.760 --> 05:02.966
You thought I found a way to stop it?

05:03.600 --> 05:07.400
But that was before he grew so powerful.
It was the...

05:08.480 --> 05:10.960
The hope you had in me
was able to counteract his magic.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.248
And now my hope's not enough?

05:17.080 --> 05:18.411
So, where are we?

05:18.600 --> 05:20.443
Um, good news, bad news time.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.610
Uh, good news is, is that Darhk
hasn't launched the nukes yet.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.490
I think his hacker is still trying to
break our fail-safes.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.921
Okay. And the bad news?

05:27.080 --> 05:29.287
Well, the bad news is
that, with Rubicon offline,

05:29.480 --> 05:30.811
- there is nothing for me to hack into.
- Right.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.764
- But your laptop has to have a GPS...
- Yeah.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.445
I'm sure that you've already
started to try and do that.

05:34.680 --> 05:35.966
- Okay.
- Yeah.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.924
I thought you had shut Rubicon down.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.765
Yeah, Felicity is working on
locating the laptop.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.169
- Where's Sara?
- She's fine.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.840
She's in an A.R.G.U.S. bunker
in Coast City.

05:46.080 --> 05:49.482
With Darhk's anti-nuke bunker destroyed,
why is he moving forward with Genesis?

05:49.680 --> 05:50.920
Machin killed his wife.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.447
Well, his daughter still lives
in this world. He must know that.

05:53.640 --> 05:56.291
He knows. He just, he doesn't care.
He's lost all hope.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.606
Yeah, just like all of us.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.444
But I thought he was the cynic.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.608
It's not like John doesn't
have a point, Thea.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.610
We are not finished yet.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.643
Kewvord being "yet."
I got a 20 on the laptop.

06:05.880 --> 06:06.847
Downtown, abandoned office building.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.280
Let's move.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.005
<i>Oven/vatch, there's no one here.</i>

06:21.200 --> 06:22.884
That's impossible.
You're right on top of the GPS signal.

06:29.800 --> 06:30.961
She's right.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.366
Oh, my God.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.726
- Oven/vatch.
- I see it.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.364
Just over 15,000 ballistic missiles,
and they all just launched.

06:47.560 --> 06:48.846
How much time do we have?

06:49.040 --> 06:51.520
Two hours. Maybe less.

07:00.600 --> 07:04.047
Confirmed. 15,434 birds in the air.

07:04.240 --> 07:07.881
We need to set Defense Condition One
and get the President down to the PEOC.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.047
Felicity?

07:09.280 --> 07:10.247
He's got me completely locked out.

07:10.440 --> 07:11.441
Okay, how many missiles are there?

07:11.680 --> 07:13.682
D.O.D.'s working on it,
but the targets are worldwide.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.008
- You said that we have two hours.
- The world has two hours.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.368
But I'm tracking a Minuteman ICBM
heading straight for Star City.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.363
<i>It just launched out of
Warren Air Force Base in Colorado.</i>

07:20.560 --> 07:21.607
Okay. Well, that's close.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.365
Which means we only have 45 minutes.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.769
- Taiana.
- I'm okay.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.401
I think

07:54.600 --> 07:55.931
I'm okay.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.761
Taiana?

08:00.440 --> 08:01.885
All right, where's the fire?

08:03.400 --> 08:05.129
- What's this?
- The safest place within 100 miles

08:05.320 --> 08:07.243
to survive a nuclear attack,
based on wind patterns and...

08:07.440 --> 08:09.602
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.
What are you talking about?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.410
The world is gonna end in two hours.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.282
I need you to take my mother there.
Can you do that?

08:16.080 --> 08:17.127
Yeah, I will.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.170
<i>"SARA". Bye, Daddy. Bye, Mama.</i>

08:25.440 --> 08:28.011
- We'll see you soon, sweetie.
- I love you, baby girl.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.960
A.R.G.U.S. has a chopper
waiting to take us to Coast City.

08:35.919 --> 08:37.922
So, at least we'll all be together,

08:39.600 --> 08:41.364
if we can't stop the...

08:41.640 --> 08:43.130
The end of the world.

08:43.520 --> 08:47.605
In these situations,
you're usually the one offering hope.

08:48.760 --> 08:49.966
I'm fresh out, Lyla.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.810
Because of what happened with Andy?

08:52.520 --> 08:55.205
It was self-defense, John.
It was a clean kill.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.164
Lyla, are you having A.R.G.U.S.
move on City Hall?

09:00.360 --> 09:02.681
John told me
the source of Darhk's power is there,

09:03.280 --> 09:05.681
that he might be looking to harness
the deaths from the nuclear attacks.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.645
No, he's already done that
with the first attack.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.411
He will decimate your team.
You should pull them back.

09:11.680 --> 09:12.806
And what if his hacker's
down there with him?

09:12.960 --> 09:15.486
Cooper Seldon is not gonna be anywhere
that we think to look.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.165
He'll be in a secure location.

09:17.360 --> 09:20.682
If your team goes down there,
they will all die.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.486
It's not your call, Oliver, it's mine.

09:32.400 --> 09:36.371
I don't like this place. It's scary.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.321
It's just a little bit longer, sweetheart.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.526
I miss Mommy.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.411
I do, too.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.604
But we're gonna see her soon.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.081
<i>Assault Team
Sledgehammer has engaged target.</i>

10:14.280 --> 10:15.566
<i>Switching you to their feed now.</i>

10:32.560 --> 10:33.766
Turn it off.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.966
With those missiles hitting, he's gonna
become even stronger, isn't he?

10:44.240 --> 10:45.321
He already is with the souls of

10:45.560 --> 10:46.925
all of those A.R.G.U.S. agents
that he just killed.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.401
Wait. I'm in.
I'm through Cooper's firewalls.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.011
- Well, shut it down.
- That's what I'm trying to...

12:25.680 --> 12:28.684
Look at me, listen to me.
Don't let it control your mind.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.609
You are a murderer!

12:37.200 --> 12:40.682
You killed my brother! You are darkness!

12:42.240 --> 12:45.847
Yes, lam...
But you don't have to be.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.843
I am sorry.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.366
It's okay.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.682
I can feel it burning my mind.

12:56.880 --> 13:00.521
Taiana, we will find a way
to work around this.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.202
There is only one way.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.368
You have to kill me, Oliver.

13:12.760 --> 13:15.240
<i>With Mayor Adams
missing and presumed dead,</i>

13:15.480 --> 13:18.882
<i>Deputy Mayor Remz called for calm
in the wake of unconfirmed reports</i>

13:19.080 --> 13:21.890
<i>that a nuclear attack on our city
is imminent.</i>

13:22.200 --> 13:24.885
<i>Newly installed
Police Captain Frank Pike...</i>

13:25.040 --> 13:26.610
As if things couldn't get any worse.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.767
Is everyone all right?

13:27.960 --> 13:29.405
I think "all right" is a relative term.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.601
How much time do we have?

13:30.800 --> 13:33.087
I think, 27 minutes.
It's kind of hard to tell now.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.444
I wonder what Laurel
would have thought of all this.

13:37.640 --> 13:38.926
Well, she probably would've said

13:39.120 --> 13:41.726
something about finding a solution,
no matter what.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.604
Yeah. She was always stubborn like that.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.485
Too bad she would've been wrong this time.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.764
Hey, come on,
we can't just lose all hope here.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.285
You have.

13:55.480 --> 13:56.925
I can see it in your eyes.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.766
I just can't believe that I thought

14:03.760 --> 14:08.607
that I'd be the one to unite this city
while Damien Darhk was trying to kill it.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.520
That was arrogant.

14:12.440 --> 14:16.286
The same arrogance that made me feel like
I could be the Green Arrow

14:16.480 --> 14:17.845
without descending into darkness.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.963
Bottom line, it was foolish.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.128
- You don't believe that.
- I didn't believe that,

14:24.160 --> 14:25.286
until Laurel died.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.528
I thought you weren't blaming yourself
for her death anymore.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.121
We made a decision to come back here.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.690
I tried to do things differently.

14:33.880 --> 14:35.644
And, for a time, I did.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.962
And now I am left here to wonder,

14:43.120 --> 14:44.565
if I hadn't,

14:46.840 --> 14:48.569
would Laurel still be alive?

14:52.360 --> 14:54.488
Curtis. You shouldn't be up.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.205
Tell me about it.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.526
But someone's gotta provide
a little optimism.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.170
It doesn't seem like anyone around here
is in the head-space to do it.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.885
You know we've lost the city.

15:05.640 --> 15:09.565
No, I know that you're running out of time
to get it back.

15:12.560 --> 15:16.485
Look, living in Star City requires
a special kind of tenacity.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.363
A sane person wouldn't live here.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.167
It's a fact that Paul
likes to remind me of weekly.

15:23.880 --> 15:27.168
We were this close
to leaving Star City last October.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.565
After three terrorist attacks,
we were done.

15:32.680 --> 15:33.920
But then,

15:34.720 --> 15:36.848
the night before
we were gonna start packin',

15:37.040 --> 15:39.520
the Green Arrow popped up on our TV,

15:40.680 --> 15:43.524
and he reminded me
that this city is worth saving.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.125
That my home...

15:47.880 --> 15:50.406
That my home was worth fighting for.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.369
That guy gave me inspiration.

15:57.280 --> 15:58.611
He gave me hope.

15:59.920 --> 16:05.086
And if he could give me hope then,
why can't he give it to others now?

16:17.560 --> 16:20.291
Hey! Calm down! Stop!

16:23.160 --> 16:26.767
Please! I know
what you're feeling right now.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.602
I'm feeling it, too.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.847
The sense of helplessness.
Of hopelessness.

16:36.400 --> 16:42.806
I don't know how we even begin to process
what might happen to us right now.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.484
But there are a few things that I do know.

16:47.280 --> 16:51.171
I know that this city has been through
tough times before,

16:51.440 --> 16:53.488
and we have pulled through.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.683
We survived the Undertaking,

16:57.680 --> 17:01.207
we survived the siege,
we survived the outbreak,

17:01.440 --> 17:06.970
and somehow, someway we will survive this.

17:08.599 --> 17:13.127
<i>A friend of mine told me
that living in Star City</i>

17:13.319 --> 17:15.448
<i>takes a special kind of tenacity.</i>

17:16.839 --> 17:21.880
<i>But we do live here
because this is our home.</i>

17:23.960 --> 17:26.884
<i>This is our home.</i>

17:27.680 --> 17:32.004
<i>It is our friends. Our family. Our lives.</i>

17:32.200 --> 17:37.650
<i>And we will not, we will not
throw those precious gifts away</i>

17:38.160 --> 17:40.401
<i>by descending into chaos.</i>

17:41.360 --> 17:43.328
We will look to each other for hope.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.561
We will cling to each other for strength.

17:48.040 --> 17:54.491
If we do that, no matter what happens,
then we can all stand here united.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.560
Oh, my God, it's here.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.321
<i>"BURNS". That's terrifying.</i>

18:02.080 --> 18:03.366
And also kind of great.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.762
I think you got hit on the head
harder than you realize.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.729
No. No, he's right.
I can't hack this system.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.922
But if the nuke gets close enough,
which it is...

18:10.160 --> 18:13.050
We could use the line-of-sight attack
on the missile itself and disarm it.

18:14.000 --> 18:14.922
<i>I'm still not getting a signal.</i>

18:15.160 --> 18:16.446
<i>Are you sure
you're pointing that thing at the nuke?</i>

18:16.680 --> 18:17.727
It's pretty hard to miss, Felicity.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.001
Okay, okay, okay! I'm just going...

18:19.240 --> 18:20.287
Uh. Whatever you changed,

18:20.520 --> 18:21.885
don't change it again, it's working.
I got the signal.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.121
I didn't change anything.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.408
Nukes are designed to detonate
100 feet above their actual target.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.046
I'm uploading a GPS spoof
so it thinks it's already detonated.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.204
Great! But, um,
it is still headed straight for us.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.522
Just keep pointing
the IR receiver at the thingy.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.291
I have perfect confidence
in your abilities.

18:35.520 --> 18:36.681
- Thank you.
- But, just in case,

18:36.880 --> 18:37.961
working with you and the rest of the team

18:38.200 --> 18:40.362
has been the highlight of
my professional career and my entire life,

18:40.520 --> 18:41.931
and I can't think of any better way
for it to end...

18:42.120 --> 18:45.602
Curtis. As sweet as this is,
the talking is really not helping.

18:55.560 --> 18:56.721
Oh, my God. it worked.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.405
Oh, my God, it worked!

19:16.560 --> 19:18.403
Whatever you guys just did was incredible.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.000
We only took down one nuke.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.561
We still have 15,433 to go, give or take.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.482
The code to the line-of-sight hack.
Can you distro it to everybody?

19:26.760 --> 19:27.682
I'm on it.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.843
All right, that's one, one nuke in 15,000.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.127
The chances of us getting 'em all is...

19:31.320 --> 19:32.651
One in 375 million.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.605
Well, we need to find Darhk's hacker
and shut down Rubicon at the source.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.922
When we disarmed the nuke,
we gained access to its on board computer

19:38.080 --> 19:39.081
and cloned its hard drive remotely.

19:39.280 --> 19:42.204
Then, we ran a backtrace to determine
the source of the initial launch signal.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.205
He's holed up in a warehouse on
the corner of Cheswold and Crombie.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.441
Let's get after him.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.206
That was quite a speech, Oliver.
Made me long for a voting booth.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.010
You and Thea need to
back up Curtis and Felicity

19:51.200 --> 19:52.167
while they deal with Seldon.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.647
- Okay, what are you gonna do?
- I'm going to City Hall.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.440
Oliver, you yourself said going
after Darhk is a suicide mission.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.965
Well, John, I'm not gonna die tonight.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.610
Well, let me go with you, back you up.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.968
If things go bad,
I need you to back the city up.

20:03.360 --> 20:06.523
Oliver, things aren't gonna go bad.
Your speech

20:08.440 --> 20:09.646
inspired all of us, too.

20:13.800 --> 20:14.881
Let's move.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.565
TAIANAI Do it, Oliver.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.564
Please do it quickly.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.689
Taiana, I'm not gonna kill you.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.245
- Then I will kill you!
- Hey!

20:23.720 --> 20:24.960
Don't you understand?

20:25.320 --> 20:26.651
Please!

20:26.800 --> 20:29.531
Before I kill
whoever is left on this island.

20:30.320 --> 20:33.369
Before I become worse than Reiter, please.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.165
Please don't ask me to do this.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.331
If you ever cared for me,

20:39.520 --> 20:41.170
then you would do this.

20:44.520 --> 20:45.681
Okay.

20:48.720 --> 20:51.007
Don't forget your promise.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.561
I won't.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.365
Taiana, I'm sorry.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.201
You killed her!

21:24.720 --> 21:26.051
I thought you were staying behind.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.360
Yeah. It doesn't mean
I shouldn't be prepared.

21:31.120 --> 21:34.203
I'm not gonna ask if you're all right.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.771
I think I know the answer.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.042
Lyla, this isn't the right time
for this conversation.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.203
When the Ghosts attacked, you froze.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.131
I've never seen you do that before.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.925
- Lyla, I can't talk about this.
- Was it Andy?

21:46.280 --> 21:47.247
He was a Ghost.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.408
- Lyla...
- If the world's going to end,

21:49.560 --> 21:52.723
then let's at least go out
being honest with each other.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.769
Yes. it was Andy.

21:59.960 --> 22:03.806
But not like I said.
And not like you think.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.846
Earlier you said it was a good kill.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.250
It wasn't, Lyla.

22:16.240 --> 22:19.483
I said it was self-defense. it wasn't.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.649
You must think I'm a monster.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.329
Fog of war, Johnnie.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.285
You did what you had to do.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.805
It's that simple.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.762
Lyla, there's nothing simple about this.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.804
Darhk!

22:47.480 --> 22:50.484
What does a guy have to do
to end the world in peace?

22:50.720 --> 22:52.324
<i>"NORA". Why is he here, Daddy?</i>

22:52.520 --> 22:54.443
Oh, he came here to die, sweetheart.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.880
Clearly.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.968
Fifteen minutes till the end of the world,
and you want to spend them with me.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.685
I am touched.

23:24.720 --> 23:25.846
Thea, look out ahead of you.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.682
Thanks, unless you were aiming at me.

23:41.840 --> 23:44.047
At this point, I honestly can't tell.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.885
<i>"DARHK". Even if you stop me,</i>

23:47.080 --> 23:48.605
even if you could,

23:48.840 --> 23:51.525
those missiles are finding their targets.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.531
This is a mercy killing

23:56.880 --> 23:58.530
on a global scale.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.125
I'm sparing my daughter the pain

24:00.360 --> 24:01.850
of growing up without her mother.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.530
Or Mr. Lance living without Laurel.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.286
And don't get me started on your pain.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.202
Let him go!

24:16.040 --> 24:17.121
Get out.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.282
For real?

24:18.560 --> 24:19.607
- Get out of here.
- Get out!

24:19.800 --> 24:21.245
Get out of our town!

24:21.720 --> 24:22.926
We don't want you here!

24:23.120 --> 24:24.884
Get out of this town!

24:25.040 --> 24:27.725
- Get out!
- "Get out."

24:31.040 --> 24:32.246
Get out of here!

24:34.560 --> 24:36.562
This heartwarming display

24:36.720 --> 24:38.245
would mean a whole lot more

24:38.400 --> 24:43.804
had I not just seen you all tearing
yourselves and your city apart.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.243
That is why I did this.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.249
Humanity is feckless.

24:52.440 --> 24:54.761
And I wanted to cleanse it
of a millennia worth

24:54.920 --> 24:57.491
of rot it has been infected by,

24:57.760 --> 24:59.603
and I will do it.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.404
No, you won't.

25:05.120 --> 25:06.087
Okay,

25:06.280 --> 25:09.602
just for fun, how are you gonna stop me?

25:09.760 --> 25:13.765
Because it won't be just me
who's gonna stop you.

25:40.440 --> 25:43.125
It's not so easy without the magic, is it?

25:44.280 --> 25:46.169
Oh, I don't need magic.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.484
I'm a former member
of the League of Assassins.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.642
Or have you forgotten that?

25:51.800 --> 25:53.325
Remind me.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.881
- Oh, my God.
- Cooper?

26:17.080 --> 26:19.082
Hey, Felicity. How you doing?

26:19.320 --> 26:20.481
Who shot you?

26:20.680 --> 26:21.841
Guess.

26:22.040 --> 26:25.010
He's moving the bullet
closer and closer to my spine.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.841
Said it'd hurt so bad
I'd do anything to make him stop.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.007
Like blow up the planet.

26:29.200 --> 26:33.000
Sorry, I'm a selfish bastard.
But she knew that already.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.846
I need a moment alone with him.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.445
- Felicity, I don't think right...
- Now!

26:39.680 --> 26:41.569
I'm sorry, Felicity.

26:42.520 --> 26:46.764
I know I should be strong enough
to pull myself away from this keyboard,

26:47.040 --> 26:49.361
but I think we both know that I'm not.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.760
You are.

26:51.400 --> 26:54.688
He's powerful. He's so powerful.

26:55.520 --> 26:57.887
And if I stop Rubicon, he'll know.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.884
And he'll kill me
in the most painful way possible.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.401
You're better than this, Cooper.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.287
You're stronger than this.
You can still do the right thing.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.282
You can still be the man that I loved.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.927
I haven't been that guy in a long time.

27:16.560 --> 27:17.891
Remember what we wanted to do
seven years ago

27:18.080 --> 27:19.605
in that cockroach-infested dorm room?

27:22.040 --> 27:23.451
Save the world.

27:25.080 --> 27:26.650
Now's your chance.

27:45.400 --> 27:49.530
Mr. Seldon, you weak-willed dust mite.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.807
I'm sorry, Coop.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.327
Ah! You brought friends.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.651
That's okay. So did I.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.490
- What the hell happened?
- Darhk!

28:54.640 --> 28:56.563
We have three minutes
to take down 15,000 nukes.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.848
Why isn't this a simple matter
of flicking off a switch?

28:59.000 --> 29:02.209
Rubicon has safeguards for their
safeguards. I can't disarm a warhead.

29:02.400 --> 29:03.367
Then don't.

29:03.560 --> 29:04.846
I don't think you understand
how this works.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.486
It's not the warheads, it's the missiles.
If we invert their horizons...

29:07.680 --> 29:09.330
They'll explode in space.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.685
Now you know how it feels.

29:35.880 --> 29:37.609
- Wait, I thought you and Donna...
- Don't worry. She's safe.

29:37.880 --> 29:39.086
But I had to come back
to stand with my city.

29:39.280 --> 29:41.408
'Cause this Oliver Queen guy
gives a hell of a speech.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.690
You two were supposed to stay as backup.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.211
I already lost one brother.

29:45.360 --> 29:47.727
You two put down the Ghosts.
You keep people safe.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.531
- What about Darhk?
- Darhk's mine.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.762
What are you gonna do now, Oliver?

30:31.240 --> 30:32.651
Stop posturing.

30:32.840 --> 30:35.241
We both know you can't do it.

30:35.960 --> 30:40.284
You spared the life of the man
who killed your own mother.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.602
You killed a friend of mine.

30:45.280 --> 30:48.090
You've killed tens of thousands
of innocent people.

30:49.840 --> 30:52.286
With Slade Wilson, I had a choice.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.446
This time, I don't.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.521
It's gonna take forever
to clean this place up.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.168
Well, I wish you guys
the best of luck with that.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.640
You going home to my mama?

31:25.200 --> 31:27.328
Uh, yeah, and to pack.

31:28.480 --> 31:29.811
We're leaving town for a while.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.007
Wait, why?

31:31.240 --> 31:33.641
LAB reached out.

31:33.840 --> 31:36.730
My suspension is no longer a suspension.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.083
But, uh, it's funny, you know,

31:40.320 --> 31:44.166
'cause being a cop is all I ever wanted,
but when I got that call,

31:44.360 --> 31:46.362
I didn't feel a thing.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.048
All I could think about was Laurel.
You know?

31:51.680 --> 31:55.730
But you got herjustice, Oliver,
and you got me some closure.

31:57.680 --> 31:59.170
And I'm never gonna forget that.

32:02.520 --> 32:05.171
Well, it's gonna make me feel
like I'm piling on...

32:05.360 --> 32:06.521
What do you mean?

32:06.720 --> 32:08.449
Well, l...

32:09.080 --> 32:13.210
I jumped straight out of the Lazarus Pit
right into this and to...

32:14.680 --> 32:15.841
To Speedy.

32:16.040 --> 32:19.886
But, um, I've just been wondering
if this is even who I really am?

32:21.680 --> 32:24.445
And then I threatened
to kill a little girl, and I, uh...

32:24.680 --> 32:27.684
I realized I'm my father's daughter.
So, I...

32:29.200 --> 32:33.888
I thought about Laurel and...
And what she'd say to me if she were here.

32:35.960 --> 32:38.361
I think she'd tell me to get out.

32:39.920 --> 32:42.366
Before I lost too much of myself.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.967
- I'm sorry, Ollie.
- Hey. Come here.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.885
You don't have
to apologize to me, ever.

33:00.440 --> 33:04.490
Well, it looks like
it's just the three of us.

33:06.240 --> 33:09.722
Team Arrow. The original gangsters.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.400
Up top?

33:21.600 --> 33:22.647
You Okay?

33:23.760 --> 33:27.765
Not really.
I told Lyla the truth about Andy.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.444
What did she say?

33:34.520 --> 33:37.524
She's a soldier, she understood.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.123
But I don't,
and I don't think I ever will.

33:42.600 --> 33:43.601
What are you gonna do?

33:44.960 --> 33:48.442
Take some time away from this team,

33:50.160 --> 33:51.969
away from the city.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.885
Figure out where I went off track
and how to get back on.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.885
John, I have never done this without you.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.443
You're the one who keeps me in line.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.644
Oliver, I don't know
if you've watching lately,

34:05.800 --> 34:08.280
but it's been the other way around, man.

34:26.320 --> 34:29.051
She begged me to do it.

34:31.159 --> 34:33.844
So, I know that this is not gonna
make a ton of sense,

34:34.040 --> 34:36.646
but all of this has to do with that.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.010
It is darkness!

34:40.159 --> 34:45.326
And Taiana had...
She was succumbing to that darkness.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.525
They destroyed the plane.

34:51.440 --> 34:52.726
That was Reiter.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.283
There's another way off the island.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.202
<i>And here I thought
you'd never use the comm gear I gave you</i>

35:16.400 --> 35:18.289
to radio for a trip home.

35:18.520 --> 35:21.364
Well, I lost it for a while.

35:23.040 --> 35:25.042
- And the job wasn't done.
- And now it is.

35:25.240 --> 35:27.049
I sent you here
to break up Reiter's operation

35:27.240 --> 35:29.607
and free his prisoners. You did both.

35:29.800 --> 35:32.041
- You saved a lot of lives.
- And took some, too.

35:32.240 --> 35:33.810
Do you remember what I told you?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.211
That the only way out is through?

35:36.440 --> 35:40.570
Well, I'm not out, Amanda.
I'm still filled with darkness.

35:40.880 --> 35:44.726
This was never about
expunging your darkness, Mr. Queen.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.446
That darkness
will always be a part of you.

35:49.320 --> 35:51.322
- Then what was the point?
- To show you

35:51.560 --> 35:54.484
that sometimes killing
is the only path to justice.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.245
Director Waller,
what do you wanna do with the artifact?

36:05.440 --> 36:07.090
Have it transported to The Slab.

36:07.240 --> 36:08.651
Yes, ma'am.

36:12.120 --> 36:13.326
That's it?

36:13.600 --> 36:16.490
Just gonna bag and tag everything
and pretend like nothing ever happened?

36:16.680 --> 36:20.810
You've seen what that idol can do.
How large the world truly is.

36:24.920 --> 36:26.445
Speaking of...

36:30.360 --> 36:32.442
What am I gonna do with this?

36:32.640 --> 36:35.769
Our business here is concluded, Mr. Queen.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.651
Unless it's not.

36:40.640 --> 36:43.325
As I said, justice requires killing.

36:43.680 --> 36:47.321
A man of your talents could be useful
in hot spots across the globe.

36:47.520 --> 36:51.445
Or you could just go back
to playing vigilante.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.290
Neither.

36:56.880 --> 36:58.962
I have a promise to keep.

37:01.400 --> 37:04.244
I know you wouldn't approve of what I did.

37:05.240 --> 37:09.211
I mean, I know that it's not
what you would have wanted.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.367
Me killing Darhk.

37:11.640 --> 37:14.120
<i>But you were always
better than me, Laurel.</i>

37:15.200 --> 37:17.806
That is what I loved most about you.

37:20.320 --> 37:21.526
You okay?

37:24.200 --> 37:25.326
No.

37:28.520 --> 37:32.684
It's Thea and John. It's...

37:32.840 --> 37:34.842
Them leaving has to be a blow.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.406
And they're leaving
because of their own personal darkness.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.924
I just can't help but think that
maybe they were infected by mine.

37:44.160 --> 37:45.366
Maybe.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.369
Like you said,
maybe you can't become a hero

37:48.560 --> 37:51.245
without succumbing to the darkness,
even a little bit.

37:51.640 --> 37:55.725
But you were able to defeat Darhk
by giving the city its hope back.

37:56.560 --> 37:59.325
You're saying it's not black and white?

38:00.080 --> 38:04.688
I'm saying that there is a man
who killed Darhk in cold blood.

38:06.520 --> 38:11.162
And that same man stood on top of a car
and gave the city its hope back.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.410
What you're feeling isn't darkness,
it's a schism.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.327
<i>You're at war with two sides of yourself.</i>

38:23.920 --> 38:25.001
Hello?

38:25.240 --> 38:28.403
Mr. Queen, this is Thomas Kemp.
I chair the City Council.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.688
Yes, of course, Councilman.
What can I help you with?

38:30.880 --> 38:32.564
That impromptu speech you gave

38:32.760 --> 38:36.242
during the city's latest crisis
got a lot of people's attention.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.846
And there's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

38:40.080 --> 38:43.687
It's only an interim appointment.
A proper election will be held in August.

38:43.920 --> 38:47.561
But given that you got 48% of the vote
before as a write-in candidate,

38:47.760 --> 38:52.209
- well, I think that's just a formality.
- I appreciate the optimism.

38:53.240 --> 38:57.484
Are you sure about this?
You look, well, conflicted.

38:57.720 --> 39:02.089
Well, someone very close to me
recently told me that I am.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.971
- But I am ready for this.
- Good.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.287
Shall we?

39:23.640 --> 39:25.927
Put your left hand on the Bible.

39:26.120 --> 39:29.010
Raise your right hand and recite the oath.

39:29.640 --> 39:32.644
I, Oliver Queen, do solemnly swear

39:32.800 --> 39:35.485
to support the charter
and laws of Star City,

39:35.760 --> 39:38.127
and to faithfully and impartially perform

39:38.280 --> 39:40.760
and discharge the duties
of the office of mayor,

39:40.960 --> 39:44.487
according to the law
and to the very best of my ability.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.001
Congratulations.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.602
I didn't know you'd be here.

41:31.960 --> 41:34.247
You thought I was leaving, too?

41:37.080 --> 41:38.605
Not a chance.

42:24.800 --> 42:25.801
English - SDH
