13:22.839 --> 13:24.441

13:24.508 --> 13:27.711

13:27.778 --> 13:31.413

13:31.480 --> 13:32.682
It's just--

13:32.748 --> 13:34.984
Jeff, please. It's all right.

13:35.051 --> 13:37.687
I understand your friend's

"Through you we learn

14:15.225 --> 14:18.794

14:18.861 --> 14:23.432
(LAUGHS) Ah, yes.
Our superhero names.

14:23.499 --> 14:24.867
It sounds a little silly,

14:24.934 --> 14:26.802
but you need one for
our field comms to keep

14:26.869 --> 14:28.605
your identity secret
from the bad guys.

14:28.672 --> 14:31.541
I'm Halo. It was
the first name you gave me,
and I like it.

14:31.608 --> 14:34.310
I'm Violet at home.
I'm Halo during a mission.
Halo.

14:34.377 --> 14:38.814
Halo is a beautiful name
and describes
your powers well.

14:38.881 --> 14:41.717
I will take a name
that describes my powers, too.

14:41.784 --> 14:44.553

(CHUCKLING) All right.
All right.

15:02.371 --> 15:03.973
Seriously, then.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.976
Dr. Jace had a name
for the powers
in my bloodline.

15:07.043 --> 15:09.446
She called it, uh, Geo-Force.

15:09.512 --> 15:14.512
Huh. Geo-Force.
That's a bit less
of a stripper name.

15:14.750 --> 15:17.085
Says the girl named Tigress.

15:17.152 --> 15:18.387
(PLAYFULLY GROWLS)

15:18.454 --> 15:20.189
-Ow!

his name from
an 80's mullet rock band.

15:22.992 --> 15:25.194
(LAUGHS SHEEPISHLY)
Not true.

15:25.261 --> 15:28.965
Okay. Forager,
what's your codename?

15:29.031 --> 15:33.135
Um. Forager is... Forager.

15:33.201 --> 15:34.304
If it ain't broke...

15:34.370 --> 15:37.406
Great. Names chosen.

BOTH:
...controlled to serve

17:15.204 --> 17:17.940
Both armadas suffer

17:21.543 --> 17:22.143

17:27.950 --> 17:30.419

17:37.225 --> 17:40.396
Yes, Father.
