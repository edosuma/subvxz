00:05.360 --> 00:07.828
<i>She's awake.</i>
<i>Say something romantic.</i>

00:07.920 --> 00:12.072
Do you think this is a good time to
talk about a nickname for my penis?

00:12.160 --> 00:15.994
I dated this girl in college who
made the decision without consulting me.

00:16.079 --> 00:20.517
All of a sudden, there it was, 18 months
of it being called Little Buddy.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.511
We didn't like that. Not one bit.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.797
- I haven't even had coffee yet.
- You're right. I'm sorry.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.637
Big Al, for example.

00:28.720 --> 00:31.632
Why don't you just tell me a story?
Something romantic.

00:33.520 --> 00:39.755
Once there was a beautiful girl, who met
a stunningly handsome young doctor.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.470
<i>He noticed her right away.</i>
<i>And she noticed him noticing her.</i>

00:46.840 --> 00:49.035
<i>Their first date was amazing.</i>

00:54.760 --> 00:58.594
<i>They had so much fun together,</i>
<i>they felt like kids again.</i>

01:02.040 --> 01:04.873
<i>Then it was time for their first kiss.</i>

01:04.959 --> 01:07.269
<i>And how was that?</i>

01:07.360 --> 01:09.078
<i>Intense.</i>

01:10.640 --> 01:13.518
<i>The next date</i>
<i>didn't start that well either.</i>

01:18.840 --> 01:21.673
<i>But it got better from there.</i>

01:29.560 --> 01:31.437
<i>And that night, well...</i>

01:31.520 --> 01:34.910
It was the most amazing night
the young doctor ever had.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.831
Then what happened?

01:36.920 --> 01:41.550
The young doctor realised he hadn't seen
the girl naked in the light yet.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.272
Damn.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.920
Are you as into this as I am?

01:47.000 --> 01:50.788
If I wasn't crazy about you,
would I be willing to do this?

01:52.480 --> 01:55.631
<i>As I was doing the naked chicken dance</i>
<i>Uncle Bart taught me,</i>

01:55.720 --> 01:58.678
<i>I realised life couldn't get</i>
<i>much better than this.</i>

02:01.240 --> 02:04.710
Just cos Jordan thinks it's cute
you're violating her sister,

02:04.800 --> 02:08.918
doesn't mean you can use my guest room
for your nerdy, G-rated sexcapades.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.871
And oh, my God,

02:11.960 --> 02:15.999
what are you doing with my little boy,
you sick, sick bastard?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.353
My bad.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.709
It's a beautiful shot of you.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.918
Come here...
you filthy, filthy boy.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.036
Filthy girl. Filthy girl.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.513
Are you OK, Little Buddy?

02:38.160 --> 02:40.037
<i>No!</i>

02:42.000 --> 02:48.074

02:55.160 --> 02:57.879
<i>Although Dr Cox got</i>
<i>a look at Little Buddy...</i>

02:57.960 --> 03:00.349
<i>Oh, no, now I'm saying it!</i>

03:00.440 --> 03:02.271
<i>... my day still started off great.</i>

03:02.360 --> 03:05.318
I'm about to set a new
record for projectile vomiting.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.756
Come on, it reminds me
of my sexiest kiss.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.991
Our honeymoon,
standing waist deep in the ocean...

03:12.080 --> 03:15.072
- I think you were in at the bar.
- OK, gotta go.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.910
- Come on.
- Be brilliant today.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.911
I always am.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.517
I hit my head so hard,
I saw cartoon birds.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.319
I was in paediatrics
and it was just the wallpaper.

03:29.400 --> 03:33.075
Stunning. Look, Tammy,
as far as your love life goes,

03:33.160 --> 03:37.233
I couldn't care less who's laying your
quivering body down by the fire,

03:37.320 --> 03:41.279
while your lips whisper, "No, no"
but your eyes scream, "Yes! Yes!"

03:41.360 --> 03:43.157
"Oh, big daddy, yes!"

03:43.240 --> 03:45.629
But when you're dating
Jordan's sissy-poo,

03:45.720 --> 03:48.518
it forces me to spend time with you
outside hospital,

03:48.600 --> 03:51.114
and I just won't have that,
so here's the deal.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.714
Don't wanna have dinner
or go bowling with you

03:53.800 --> 03:57.236
and I never again want to walk
into my kitchen and hear you say,

03:57.360 --> 03:59.794
<i>It's waffle time, it's waffle time</i>

03:59.880 --> 04:02.269
<i>Won't you have some waffles of mine?</i>

04:02.360 --> 04:05.477
Bottom line,
we'll be bestest friends foreverest,

04:05.560 --> 04:08.358
if you just keep your face
out of my face.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.356
- She's my patient.
- Guys, how are you?

04:17.440 --> 04:19.635
I'm great.
You know me, I'm up, up, up,

04:19.720 --> 04:23.918
then some fashion Nazi says pear-shaped
people shouldn't wear stripes

04:24.000 --> 04:27.709
and whoosh, guess who's ear-deep
in mint chocolate chip ice cream?

04:27.800 --> 04:28.789
Me.

04:28.880 --> 04:31.269
If you leave it an hour,
it's like milk shake.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.874
If it's not melted,
it hits you in the face.

04:33.960 --> 04:37.077
- That'd go everywhere.
- Once I got Chunky Monkey in my eye.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.355
- What brings Ms Tracy to us?
- Her landlord found her passed out.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.317
Lucky me, I couldn't pay my rent.

04:43.400 --> 04:47.791
<i>A recent study found doctors spend</i>
<i>15 seconds listening to a patient.</i>

04:47.880 --> 04:51.759
<i>It sounds insensitive, but the truth is,</i>
<i>it's all the time you need.</i>

04:51.840 --> 04:53.910
- How do you feel?
- Awesome.

04:54.000 --> 04:54.989
Ms Tracy.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.789
Headachey and embarrassed
my landlord saw me in granny panties.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.440
We're gonna run some tests
and figure this out.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.836
I'll be here... if you...

05:12.200 --> 05:14.634
Sorry! If that gets infected,
I'm a doctor.

05:15.920 --> 05:20.516
You keep going to the right, so aim
at that guy and you'll hit the board.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.190
- Those two are best friends now.
- I know.

05:32.280 --> 05:35.078
I wonder what it was
that made them so tight.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.598
Elliot!

05:41.600 --> 05:44.797
- What are you doing here?
- Meeting some friends for drinks.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.757
Yes, me too. Friends.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.395
Ponch!

05:51.480 --> 05:54.278
Damn, I still got it.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.514
Wait a second, dude, that was us.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.749
I know.

06:00.840 --> 06:03.149
Greatest night ever!

06:06.440 --> 06:09.352
Yes, Enid, I hear Baxter growling
but the fact is,

06:09.440 --> 06:12.398
you ventured into his side of the house.

06:12.480 --> 06:15.040
Baring his teeth, huh?

06:15.120 --> 06:20.274
OK, now here's what you do.
Are you ready?

06:20.360 --> 06:22.157
Make a sudden move.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.556
Those two!

06:28.640 --> 06:30.551
Sir, we've gotten some complaints

06:30.640 --> 06:34.838
that the discount stethoscopes
you ordered are uncomfortably tight.

06:34.920 --> 06:38.799
I contacted the manufacturer
but apparently, he's decided

06:38.880 --> 06:42.759
to focus more on his hand-made
smoking paraphernalia.

06:42.840 --> 06:45.513
Nonsense. These are fine.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.956
Are you OK...?

06:50.040 --> 06:53.669
<i>Sweet dancing Jehovah,</i>
<i>I've punctured my brain.</i>

06:55.360 --> 06:58.477
Boy oh boy, that's some rock.
When's the big day?

06:58.560 --> 07:01.313
Me? No, never. My fiancé dumped me.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.233
I'm just noticing how beautiful
his mother's ring is.

07:04.320 --> 07:07.995
You know, compared to the fake one
I sent back to him. Oops.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.355
We found organophosphates
in your system.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.715
Have you had any exposure to pesticides?

07:12.800 --> 07:15.519
Pesticides? No,
I don't have any pest problems.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.636
That must be so nice.

07:17.720 --> 07:21.918
- They're just feelings, they'll heal.
- Don't worry, we're on top of this.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.239
Jordan thinks we should
all go to the carnival.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.038
The carnival?

07:30.120 --> 07:34.318
Oh, I can't go to the carnival.
I puke at carnivals. A lot.

07:36.040 --> 07:39.874
- You don't really puke at carnivals.
- I do. But I still love 'em.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.191
Look, I have an even dandier idea.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.874
Why don't you crazy kids
do something on your own?

07:45.960 --> 07:47.791
Look, I'm Jordan's sister.

07:47.880 --> 07:51.714
So as long as I'm in town, you'll be
seeing a lot of these smiling faces.

07:51.800 --> 07:52.994
Smile.

07:57.640 --> 08:01.428
- I waxed my legs at home last night.
- How did that go?

08:01.520 --> 08:04.910
Not great. I can't do it.
I'd rather die hairy.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.719
Mrs Koenings needs help to sleep.
Haloperidol.

08:07.800 --> 08:11.110
It won't put her to sleep.
A Benzo'll knock her right out.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.873
With Benzos, older people
can have a bad reaction.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.635
- Have I ever steered you wrong?
- Who suggested this?

08:20.320 --> 08:23.278
- Smooth.
- Benzo it is.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.794
Hey, what about this one?

08:28.360 --> 08:29.839
Dude, my broccoli is hot.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.595
Please say you mean temperature-wise.
You can't find broccoli sexy.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.798
Oh, yeah, temperature-wise.
And mini-green-boobs-wise.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.357
What's up!

08:41.480 --> 08:44.552
Sir, I wanted to talk to you
about that hernia seminar...

08:44.640 --> 08:47.552
OK, sure. We can totally talk later.

08:47.640 --> 08:48.959
Hey, Dr Kelso.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.470
I don't know if you heard, but Bernice,

08:52.560 --> 08:55.950
the lady who does the PA
announcements, just got hit by a bus.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.031
I was on the speech team at school...

09:02.640 --> 09:05.950
So I was thinking maybe
I could do the announcements.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.759
Just until Bernice
gets back on her... foot.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.149
Splendid.

09:19.480 --> 09:23.109
<i>Dr Cox seems to be having fun.</i>
<i>But I think I know why.</i>

09:24.520 --> 09:26.875
Whack-a-newbie!

09:26.960 --> 09:28.678
Missed me!

09:28.760 --> 09:30.193
Whack-a-newbie!

09:31.720 --> 09:33.233
Missed me!

09:33.320 --> 09:34.912
Whack-a-newbie!

09:35.960 --> 09:37.632
Perry?

09:37.720 --> 09:40.359
- It's over.
- Sorry.

09:40.440 --> 09:45.116
We're gonna eat food and look at the
Fat Lady to make ourselves feel better.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.510
We'll meet you guys on the Ferris wheel,
if your stomach's OK.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.512
It's the back-and-forth-y rides
that get me.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.319
Well, you have done it.
It's Friday night

09:54.400 --> 09:57.631
and instead of drinking whiskey
through my son's sippy cup,

09:57.720 --> 10:00.792
I'm actually at a carnival with you,
surrounded by...

10:00.880 --> 10:04.429
...piles of manure, even though
I've yet to see a single animal.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.988
- That is weird.
- I'll tell you what.

10:07.080 --> 10:11.153
How about we head over there and if you
can raise that hammer above your head

10:11.240 --> 10:13.310
with those chicken bones you call arms,

10:13.400 --> 10:15.868
I'll let you take a free whack
at my dome.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.598
I already raised the hammer.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.719
The only reason I didn't ring the bell
is that the game is obviously rigged.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.756
Good job, Son!

10:23.840 --> 10:26.559
The only positive thing
about this whole situation

10:26.640 --> 10:30.872
is that it's driving you crazy
and there's nothing you can do about it.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.713
- Way to go, Tina!
- Oh, come on!

10:37.360 --> 10:41.558
Dr Tushi, you're needed in the OR.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.235
<i>Nice name, buddy.</i>
<i>Beat up in high school much?</i>

10:45.320 --> 10:47.436
- It's OK.
- What's going on?

10:47.520 --> 10:50.398
She's having a reaction to the Benzo.

10:53.880 --> 10:57.190
<i>There are a lot of ways to get</i>
<i>the upper hand in a relationship.</i>

10:57.280 --> 11:00.556
Oh, I gave the guy half a corndog
so we can all ride foursies.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.952
Just go.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.950
Corndog.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.315
<i>It can happen with a simple request.</i>

11:08.400 --> 11:11.517
Could you take a look at my ears?

11:13.600 --> 11:15.750
<i>It can happen because of a mistake.</i>

11:15.840 --> 11:18.400
Mrs Koenings stabilized,
so D <i>I</i> C the Posey vest.

11:18.480 --> 11:21.233
That's never happened to me
with a Benzo. I think...

11:21.320 --> 11:24.357
What do you think?
Did you think maybe I'm the doctor?

11:24.440 --> 11:27.512
That's what I think so maybe
you should just D <i>I</i> C the vest

11:27.600 --> 11:29.750
and keep your opinion to yourself.

11:33.760 --> 11:38.629
<i>Even when you have the upper hand,</i>
<i>it's important to be careful.</i>

11:38.720 --> 11:40.711
<i>Because some people fight dirty.</i>

11:40.800 --> 11:45.749
You know, Danni, it's amazing that
you're actually comfortable dating JD

11:45.840 --> 11:48.559
what with him having
nailed Jordan and all.

11:51.160 --> 11:56.188
<i>Sor</i> ry <i>, folks, little problem here.</i>
<i>Get you down in about an hour or so.</i>

12:01.680 --> 12:03.989
I don't feel so good.

12:10.520 --> 12:14.149
<i>Sometimes the best thing to do</i>
<i>is to say exactly what's in your heart.</i>

12:14.240 --> 12:16.310
I'm sorry I puked on your shoes.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.470
I'm sorry I wore sandals.

12:18.560 --> 12:23.111
Danni, that whole thing with Jordan...
It's so long ago, I don't remember it.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.476
You keep a sex-journal of all
your experiences under your bed.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.950
- Gotta stop showing it to girlfriends.
- You should have told me.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.316
I'm not gonna let it mess things
up with the guy I'm in love with.

12:33.400 --> 12:36.233
Thank God. Do you wanna get
some pineapple pizza?

12:37.240 --> 12:40.073
I think I'll probably just
go inside and wash my feet.

12:42.760 --> 12:44.671
That's robot for "good night".

12:46.520 --> 12:48.476
Peace.

12:48.560 --> 12:52.997
All right, people, listen up. Dr Kelso
has ruptured both his eardrums.

12:53.080 --> 12:56.755
You can say whatever you want as long
as you've got a smile on your face.

12:56.840 --> 12:58.068
You stupid mother...

13:06.200 --> 13:09.272
Thanks for the kind words, gang.

13:15.200 --> 13:18.192
- Yes?
- Carla, I just wanted to apologise.

13:18.280 --> 13:21.636
I'm so glad. I didn't want us
to stay mad at each other.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.234
It's my fault,
I shouldn't have listened to you.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.995
I need to be a strong enough doctor
to ignore you when you won't shut up.

13:28.680 --> 13:31.069
That's so sweet.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.755
<i>All medical personnel, report</i>
<i>to the second floor for a catfight.</i>

13:34.840 --> 13:36.796
<i>Catfight on the second floor.</i>

13:42.480 --> 13:46.359
We sent Hazmat guys to your apartment.
There were no signs of pesticides.

13:46.440 --> 13:49.637
They also said you mixed Art Deco
with Indonesian antiques.

13:49.720 --> 13:52.871
- I think that is so daring.
- Reel it in, Queer Eye.

13:52.960 --> 13:56.589
Thanks. I can't remember the
last time anyone was this nice to me.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.114
Well, you know... We gotta go.

14:00.520 --> 14:04.513
Your little cheap shot didn't land.
Danni isn't mad at me at all.

14:04.600 --> 14:08.673
Hey, baby. Comin' to give Pop-pops
some candy? Cos I'm hungry.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.194
OK, later's fine too.

14:11.280 --> 14:15.910
Oh, yeah. I mean,
I can feel the love all over.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.119
Can you believe Elliot
giving me all that attitude?

14:21.200 --> 14:23.794
Two weeks ago, a nurse
with 20 years' experience

14:23.880 --> 14:25.836
told me I was tying the wrong suture.

14:25.920 --> 14:29.230
- I bet you listened to her.
- I kicked her ass out the OR.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.834
- But you were nice about it?
- No, I made her cry.

14:31.920 --> 14:35.310
The point is, whatever happens
with a patient is on my shoulders.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.313
It's the same with Elliot. That's why
your relationship's complicated.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.312
Outside this hospital,
you're the boss of Elliot.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.836
You're the boss of me
and you're the boss of everyone.

14:45.920 --> 14:49.230
But in this building,
Elliot's in charge.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.594
Am I really the boss
of everybody outside?

14:53.680 --> 14:56.797
Baby, you the boss
of everybody in the world.

14:59.320 --> 15:03.438
<i>Dr Dorian, Dr Turk is free</i>
<i>for his rectal exam.</i>

15:03.520 --> 15:05.670
<i>He said you'd know what that means.</i>

15:08.000 --> 15:11.595
"Dear Dr Cox, it's important
you know how much I care for Danni...

15:11.680 --> 15:15.116
and how hurt I was by your attempt
to sabotage our relationship."

15:15.200 --> 15:17.839
- Isn't it enough that I'm reading it?
- I'm sorry.

15:17.920 --> 15:21.993
Always fun to be in the bathroom
listening to people talk so clearly

15:22.080 --> 15:25.993
you're sure they just heard you pee.
You did, didn't you?

15:26.080 --> 15:29.755
- You start and stop a lot.
- Lovely. Here.

15:29.840 --> 15:33.549
Great news, Ms Tracy.
We're sending you home.

15:33.640 --> 15:37.918
I wish we could've figured out
how that stuff got into your system.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.312
Sometimes in medicine you have to chalk
it up to one of life's great mysteries,

15:42.400 --> 15:45.676
like crop circles,
or this gal's Adam's apple.

15:45.760 --> 15:48.672
- I'm a girl, that's original.
- I just want to say,

15:48.760 --> 15:52.514
if I don't see you again,
thanks and take care.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.716
Be well, darling. See you next time.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.793
- Wanna hear a great letter?
- No.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.515
Hey, everybody.
This place has dynamite lamb.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.114
- What are you doing here?
- I called him.

16:09.200 --> 16:14.228
After shooting my mouth off the other
night, I've been feeling a lot of...

16:14.320 --> 16:16.880
- Guilt.
- No. Not that.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.633
- Guilt?
- Yes, that.

16:19.720 --> 16:23.269
- I don't like her to be right.
- You're upset about your sister...

16:23.360 --> 16:27.239
If I didn't date guys she slept with,
I wouldn't have a date to the Prom.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.392
- Then what is it?
- I said I was falling in love with you.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.948
- You know what you said?
- Thank you?

16:33.040 --> 16:37.397
- You asked me if I wanted pizza.
- No, pineapple pizza.

16:37.480 --> 16:41.075
You can't take this personally.
Doctors don't listen to anyone.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.230
Don't lump us together with numb-nuts.

16:43.320 --> 16:47.518
Really? This morning I asked you
to do me a favour involving my mother.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.158
What was it?

16:50.880 --> 16:56.159
Well, I hope that it had something
to do with hiring people to kill her?

16:56.240 --> 16:59.550
Oh, come on. I hope you guys
listen better to your patients.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.596
<i>For some reason, right then,</i>

17:01.680 --> 17:05.069
<i>we both knew how those pesticides</i>
<i>got into our patient's system.</i>

17:05.160 --> 17:07.913
Lucky for me,
I couldn't pay my rent this month.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.673
That's some rock.
When's the big day?

17:10.760 --> 17:13.718
Oh me, no, no, never.
My fiancé dumped me.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.634
I can't remember the last time
anyone was this nice to me.

17:17.720 --> 17:22.919
I just want to say, if I don't see you
again, thanks and take care.

17:24.640 --> 17:28.109
- She did it to herself.
- Gotta go.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.956
<i>The problem with only listening</i>
<i>to a patient for 15 seconds is,</i>

17:36.040 --> 17:38.076
<i>sometimes you don't hear everything.</i>

17:38.160 --> 17:41.596
<i>When you finally realise</i>
<i>what they were t</i> ry <i>ing to say,</i>

17:41.680 --> 17:44.558
<i>you might have lost them forever.</i>

17:45.680 --> 17:48.672
- Ms Tracy.
- Hey, guys.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.797
- We need to talk.
- About what?

17:51.880 --> 17:54.917
How have things been going lately?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.718
OK. Why?

18:02.440 --> 18:05.477
Actually, it has...

18:05.560 --> 18:08.074
...been a couple of rough months.

18:08.160 --> 18:12.199
Come on, Jill.
Come on.

18:12.280 --> 18:16.273
<i>You can never underestimate</i>
<i>the importance of listening.</i>

18:20.160 --> 18:22.958
A quick note for all
my comatose listeners out there.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.793
All your lovers have moved on.

18:25.880 --> 18:29.190
If it's any consolation,
my sources tell me they're happy.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.919
Well, snooze you lose.
In other news...

18:32.000 --> 18:35.231
- Get off that thing.
- <i>Listening can affect your career.</i>

18:35.320 --> 18:37.197
There you are, you deaf bastard.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.397
I hate you so much,
every time you utter my name,

18:40.480 --> 18:45.395
I wanna stick my fist down your throat
and watch you slowly choke on it.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.789
Ted, I can hear now.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.071
Who's Ted?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.876
<i>Listening can even mend a friendship.</i>

18:54.960 --> 18:58.714
Carla, could you go get...
You know what? Forget it.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.076
No, Doctor. Just tell me
what you need, I'll do it.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.750
Give him one gram of Ancef
for prophylaxis.

19:08.040 --> 19:11.032
<i>Ultimately, it keeps you in the moment.</i>

19:11.120 --> 19:13.680
<i>So you don't miss</i>
<i>the things that really matter.</i>

19:13.760 --> 19:17.196
- Say it again.
- No, you have to earn it.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.032
I'll try.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.592
Oh for God's sake,
we're watching a movie here.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.357
Kill me.
