00:44.274 --> 00:46.159
Is that Joanna Beauchamp?

00:46.210 --> 00:47.410
What's she doing here?

00:47.444 --> 00:48.611
Evening, Joanna.

00:49.996 --> 00:51.824
Heading to the big
engagement party?

00:51.944 --> 00:53.333
Calm down, Ollie.

00:53.384 --> 00:55.051
It's okay.

01:00.591 --> 01:02.725
Come on, let's go.

01:12.102 --> 01:13.686
<i>Freya, come on, let's go!</i>

01:13.737 --> 01:15.071
<i>We're gonna be late!</i>

01:15.105 --> 01:16.739
I know, I know.

01:16.774 --> 01:19.576
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:19.610 --> 01:20.777
I hate this dress.

01:20.811 --> 01:22.078
I should change, shouldn't I?

01:22.112 --> 01:23.352
- I better go change.
- Stop it.

01:23.383 --> 01:25.746
You look beautiful.

01:25.866 --> 01:27.817
Plus, you've already
changed five times.

01:27.835 --> 01:29.452
If you do it again,
I might have to smack you.

01:29.486 --> 01:30.620
Why am I so nervous?

01:30.654 --> 01:32.172
It's your engagement party.

01:32.206 --> 01:33.623
Of course you're nervous.

01:33.657 --> 01:35.124
No, no, it's not that.

01:35.158 --> 01:37.158
I just... I feel off.

01:37.282 --> 01:39.283
I had the strangest dream
last night.

01:39.317 --> 01:42.152
There was this guy, and I
never seen him before,

01:42.170 --> 01:44.488
but I felt like
I'd known him forever.

01:44.506 --> 01:49.293
And then he kissed me,
and... the world exploded.

01:49.327 --> 01:51.178
That is a classic anxiety dream.

01:51.213 --> 01:53.130
You're worried about getting
married, it's a big step,

01:53.164 --> 01:55.216
so create a dream scenario
about the perfect guy

01:55.267 --> 01:56.348
who doesn't actually exist.

01:56.351 --> 01:57.468
But I'm not anxious.

01:57.502 --> 01:59.186
I know Dash is the one.

01:59.221 --> 02:00.837
I love him so much.

02:00.856 --> 02:02.189
I don't want anyone else.

02:02.224 --> 02:04.007
Which is why I am
so freaked out.

02:04.025 --> 02:05.776
You know about me and my dreams.

02:05.810 --> 02:07.194
You're not psychic.
I might be.

02:07.229 --> 02:09.196
I can read auras.
That's not a thing.

02:09.231 --> 02:11.365
Scoff all you want, but
I know I have the gift.

02:11.399 --> 02:15.202
You only have one superpower,
and it is your breasts.

02:15.237 --> 02:16.520
Mom! Mom!

02:16.538 --> 02:18.178
Where were you?
Scared the crap out of us.

02:18.189 --> 02:20.023
In the car waiting for you.

02:20.041 --> 02:22.960
You look beautiful.

02:24.829 --> 02:26.914
I can't believe
my baby's getting married.

02:26.965 --> 02:29.032
Mom, it's an engagement
party, not a wedding.

02:29.050 --> 02:30.384
Come on, we have to go.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.392
♪ Take a walk with me

02:38.426 --> 02:40.311
♪ On the water

02:40.345 --> 02:44.431
♪ Got the power
to make you a believer ♪

02:44.482 --> 02:47.551
♪ Take you where
you never been before ♪

02:47.569 --> 02:50.554
♪ Never been before...

02:52.274 --> 02:55.559
So am I the only one who finds
this completely exhausting?

02:55.577 --> 02:57.561
And it's not even our wedding.

02:57.579 --> 02:59.563
I will marry you
in Vegas tomorrow if you want.

02:59.581 --> 03:00.948
Really?

03:00.999 --> 03:02.032
Wherever, whenever.

03:02.066 --> 03:03.033
Aw.

03:03.067 --> 03:05.068
Oh, and by the way,

03:05.086 --> 03:06.403
I forgive you.

03:06.421 --> 03:07.904
For what?

03:07.923 --> 03:09.256
For being a half an hour
late tonight.

03:09.291 --> 03:10.841
People were starting
to look at me funny.

03:10.875 --> 03:11.908
I wasn't half an hour late.

03:11.927 --> 03:13.210
You are always at least

03:13.244 --> 03:14.295
15 minutes late
for everything you do.

03:14.346 --> 03:15.346
Five minutes.

03:16.881 --> 03:18.349
Did I mention
you're worth the wait?

03:23.138 --> 03:24.388
Hi, Mom.

03:24.422 --> 03:26.357
I was wondering
where you got off to.

03:26.391 --> 03:27.558
Hmm.

03:27.592 --> 03:29.059
Mm. Oh, look at that.

03:29.093 --> 03:30.978
Why don't you come
back into the party.

03:31.029 --> 03:33.063
This is such

03:33.097 --> 03:34.431
an interesting dress, dear.

03:34.449 --> 03:36.483
I like how you just
put it all out there,

03:36.534 --> 03:39.102
and screw what other people
think is appropriate.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.405
I really do appreciate
all you're doing for us.

03:41.439 --> 03:43.207
You don't have to
be so generous.

03:43.241 --> 03:44.291
Oh, it's nothing.

03:44.326 --> 03:46.627
I want us to be close, dear.

03:46.661 --> 03:48.445
I never had a daughter.

03:48.463 --> 03:50.247
And I was always hoping
that when Dashiell married,

03:50.281 --> 03:51.448
that she and I would have

03:51.466 --> 03:52.906
the relationship
I always dreamed of.

03:52.917 --> 03:54.418
Yes, I would love that.

03:54.452 --> 03:55.919
Good. I hope we can.

03:55.953 --> 03:57.304
I just have to say,

03:57.339 --> 04:00.424
I know that you were raised in,
well, a certain way,

04:00.458 --> 04:02.393
you know, through no fault
of your own,

04:02.427 --> 04:04.127
and I would really like

04:04.145 --> 04:06.563
to help teach you about
etiquette and-and style

04:06.598 --> 04:09.183
and all the other things that
you never had a chance to learn.

04:09.234 --> 04:10.434
But we can talk
about that later.

04:10.468 --> 04:11.435
I'll take you to lunch,

04:11.469 --> 04:12.903
and we'll go shopping.

04:12.937 --> 04:14.605
I'll find you a bra
that actually fits.

04:14.639 --> 04:17.107
Ooh, that's wonderful!
Look at that.

04:17.141 --> 04:19.159
I hope you choke on it.

04:21.997 --> 04:23.197
Mom? Are you okay?

04:26.584 --> 04:27.668
Hey.

04:27.702 --> 04:28.669
Dude...

04:28.703 --> 04:30.087
Don't call me "dude."

04:30.121 --> 04:32.122
You'll never believe
what I just did.

04:32.156 --> 04:34.375
I made Dash's mother choke,
with my mind.

04:34.426 --> 04:35.592
Is she okay?

04:35.627 --> 04:36.677
You're totally
missing the point.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.095
Am I?

04:38.129 --> 04:39.496
Ingrid, she basically called me

04:39.514 --> 04:41.432
a poor townie with bad
taste and no manners,

04:41.466 --> 04:43.684
and then I wished for her
to choke, and she did.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.269
So...

04:45.303 --> 04:46.520
So I'm pretty sure
there's no way

04:46.554 --> 04:48.222
that could just
be a coincidence.

04:48.273 --> 04:50.224
Then you don't understand
statistics and probability.

04:50.275 --> 04:52.192
I don't need to;
I have powers.

04:52.227 --> 04:53.477
Choking powers.

04:53.511 --> 04:56.030
Congratulations?

04:56.064 --> 04:57.698
Oh, my God.

04:57.700 --> 04:58.982
Ingrid, it's him.

04:59.016 --> 05:00.016
Who?

05:00.035 --> 05:01.952
The guy from my dream.

05:01.986 --> 05:04.288
Okay, that
guy is fairly hot.

05:10.245 --> 05:12.246
Are you blushing?

05:12.297 --> 05:13.257
This can't be happening.

05:13.298 --> 05:14.965
It's not.

05:14.999 --> 05:16.216
You are experiencing something
called illusory correlation.

05:16.251 --> 05:18.218
You had a dream
about a hot guy,

05:18.253 --> 05:19.970
and now you see a hot guy,

05:20.004 --> 05:22.222
so you retroactively turn him
into the guy from your dream,

05:22.257 --> 05:24.007
so you can say
the dream is prescient

05:24.041 --> 05:25.375
when it's really
just a coincidence.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.560
You think everything's
a coincidence.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.345
Because most things are.
Come on, Ingrid!

05:28.379 --> 05:29.596
First Dash's mom and now this?

05:29.647 --> 05:30.681
What's your explanation?

05:30.715 --> 05:32.316
I would say you're losing it

05:32.350 --> 05:34.351
due to wedding stress.
I need a drink.

05:37.655 --> 05:40.157
Stop.

05:54.756 --> 05:56.423
Creepy, right?

05:56.458 --> 05:58.292
Yeah.

05:59.344 --> 06:01.628
Extremely creepy.
Sorry.

06:01.679 --> 06:03.046
Didn't mean to startle
you, Mrs. Beauchamp.

06:03.080 --> 06:05.132
Dash.

06:05.183 --> 06:07.267
Come on, we're at
your engagement party,

06:07.302 --> 06:10.020
you're marrying my daughter;
you can call me Joanna.

06:10.054 --> 06:11.438
Of course.

06:11.473 --> 06:13.440
Joanna.

06:13.475 --> 06:15.726
You know, it's-it's actually
the man who built this place

06:15.760 --> 06:17.111
back in the early 1900s.

06:17.145 --> 06:18.729
Archibald Browning.

06:18.763 --> 06:20.263
You heard of him?

06:20.281 --> 06:22.766
Yeah, he was a real
son of a bitch.

06:22.784 --> 06:24.535
So I've read. He...

06:24.569 --> 06:26.286
No, I mean, he was
into some weird stuff.

06:26.321 --> 06:27.538
That's for sure.

06:27.572 --> 06:29.323
I mean, the architecture
of this place,

06:29.374 --> 06:32.292
it's, uh, well, it's
unique, I'll give it that.

06:32.327 --> 06:34.294
The restoration process
was certainly a challenge.

06:34.329 --> 06:36.663
Well, you did
a spectacular job.

06:36.714 --> 06:39.166
Thank you, Mrs. Beauchamp.

06:40.218 --> 06:41.218
Sorry. Joanna.

06:41.252 --> 06:42.553
Please forgive me.

06:42.587 --> 06:44.338
I... yeah, I grew up
with a lot of rules.

06:44.389 --> 06:47.624
Well, you should know that
my daughter does not like rules.

06:47.642 --> 06:49.560
And if you tell her
to do something,

06:49.594 --> 06:50.761
she'll do the opposite.

06:50.795 --> 06:52.796
That's what I love about her.

06:52.814 --> 06:54.731
Well, you've only known her
for a few months.

06:54.766 --> 06:56.350
Check back with me in a year

06:56.401 --> 06:58.268
when you're ready
to strangle her.

06:58.302 --> 06:59.686
<i>I'll have a gimlet.</i>

06:59.737 --> 07:01.638
Dirty martini please.

07:01.656 --> 07:02.806
Ingrid.
Adam.

07:02.824 --> 07:04.441
Hey.
You look great.

07:04.475 --> 07:07.161
So good to see you.

07:07.195 --> 07:09.646
So, um, this house
is incredible, huh?

07:09.664 --> 07:11.498
I've never actually been inside.
Yeah.

07:11.533 --> 07:14.368
Did you know there are all
these tunnels and secret rooms

07:14.419 --> 07:16.753
where they used to have
ritual animal sacrifices

07:16.788 --> 07:19.206
and sadomasochistic sex orgies

07:19.257 --> 07:20.674
with people writhing
around naked,

07:20.708 --> 07:22.325
covered in goat blood?

07:22.343 --> 07:24.428
Um...

07:24.462 --> 07:27.297
I wrote a dissertation about it.
Oh.

07:27.331 --> 07:29.216
About witchcraft
and occult practices

07:29.267 --> 07:30.767
in post-Revolutionary New York.

07:30.802 --> 07:34.188
Not about... goat orgies.

07:34.222 --> 07:35.505
Right, um... Thank you.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.391
Uh, sounds cool.

07:37.442 --> 07:39.560
I'd love to read it sometime.
No, it's not that good.

07:39.611 --> 07:42.646
Plus, I've been a little
blocked for the past few...

07:42.680 --> 07:44.514
years or so.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.182
Oh, that's too bad.
But, you know,

07:46.201 --> 07:47.568
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

07:47.619 --> 07:50.520
So, I was sorry to hear
about you and Emma.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.573
I always liked her.
Wow.

07:52.624 --> 07:54.691
Bad news travels fast, huh?

07:54.709 --> 07:57.294
It's a small town.
Yeah.

07:57.328 --> 07:58.495
Anyway, i-it's okay.

07:58.529 --> 07:59.663
She wasn't really that...

07:59.697 --> 08:00.581
Smart?

08:00.632 --> 08:02.365
I was gonna say "nice" but...

08:02.383 --> 08:05.669
Right.
She also wasn't that smart.

08:05.703 --> 08:09.223
What can I say,
ever since you turned me down...

08:09.257 --> 08:10.307
Turned you down?

08:10.341 --> 08:11.875
What are you talking about?

08:11.893 --> 08:13.510
Yeah, about a year ago.

08:13.544 --> 08:14.711
I came into the library.

08:14.729 --> 08:16.513
You helped me pick out
a detective novel.

08:16.547 --> 08:19.149
I asked you to have dinner
with me, and...

08:19.183 --> 08:21.184
you laughed in my face.

08:21.218 --> 08:23.237
I thought you were kidding.

08:23.271 --> 08:25.239
Why would I have been kidding
about that?

08:25.273 --> 08:27.941
I, uh... Excuse me.

08:29.444 --> 08:30.911
This is Detective Noble.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.529
What?

08:32.563 --> 08:34.197
Yeah. I'll be
right there.

08:34.231 --> 08:35.866
Uh, I'm sorry. I have to go.

08:35.900 --> 08:38.335
Uh, a couple was attacked
in Melrose Park.

08:38.369 --> 08:39.870
Excuse me.
Attacked?

08:39.904 --> 08:41.738
Oh, no. Like, mugged?

08:41.756 --> 08:44.258
Like... murdered.

08:47.545 --> 08:49.379
<i>You okay?</i>

08:49.413 --> 08:52.215
Yeah. Fine.
You sure?

08:52.249 --> 08:54.217
You just seem off.
Sorry. I just...

08:54.251 --> 08:55.418
don't feel that great.

08:55.436 --> 08:56.687
Too much champagne.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.641
Killian?

09:01.693 --> 09:03.310
How are you, man?

09:06.564 --> 09:09.283
This is a...
little like seeing a ghost.

09:09.317 --> 09:10.817
Well, I figured my big brother's
getting married.

09:10.868 --> 09:12.452
I should come congratulate him.

09:12.487 --> 09:14.571
You have a brother?

09:14.605 --> 09:16.406
Yeah. I-I told you
I had a brother.

09:16.440 --> 09:17.774
No, you didn't.
That's okay.

09:17.792 --> 09:19.242
I'm not surprised he
wouldn't mention me.

09:19.276 --> 09:20.627
It's been a long time.

09:20.662 --> 09:22.245
I'm Killian.

09:23.781 --> 09:25.332
It's nice to meet you.

09:25.383 --> 09:27.668
Will you excuse me? I...

09:27.719 --> 09:29.720
Ladies' room.

09:33.791 --> 09:36.626
What is wrong with you?

10:19.670 --> 10:21.972
I don't know
what I'm doing.

10:22.006 --> 10:23.974
I shouldn't be here.

10:24.008 --> 10:26.610
I know this is
going to sound...

10:26.644 --> 10:29.563
But I had a dream about this.

10:29.614 --> 10:31.782
I think I had the same dream.

10:31.816 --> 10:32.983
What happened in yours?

11:07.602 --> 11:09.552
What...?

11:13.390 --> 11:15.558
I can't do this.

11:15.576 --> 11:18.078
I'm sorry, I don't know
what's come over me.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.238
I have to go.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.109
<i>It was a cat.</i>

11:58.143 --> 11:59.560
I'm telling you, I hit a cat,

11:59.611 --> 12:01.779
not a woman.
Okay.

12:01.814 --> 12:04.615
'Cause it looks a lot
like you hit a naked woman.

12:15.919 --> 12:17.912
They interviewed the couple
who found

12:17.963 --> 12:19.046
Bill and Mara Thatcher
last night,

12:19.081 --> 12:20.047
and get this:

12:20.082 --> 12:21.749
He said the murderer ripped out

12:21.800 --> 12:24.135
Bill's eyeballs and tongue.

12:24.169 --> 12:26.003
Ew, Ingrid.
Just ripped them right out.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.588
Enough.
How gross is that?

12:27.639 --> 12:29.707
And Maura's in a coma.

12:29.725 --> 12:31.092
They think she's gonna make it?

12:32.928 --> 12:36.597
So, did you have
a good time last night, Freya?

12:40.819 --> 12:41.769
Holy shit!

12:41.820 --> 12:44.071
There's my clumsy girl.

12:44.106 --> 12:45.690
Did you guys just see that?

12:45.724 --> 12:48.075
It-it spontaneously
broke for no reason.

12:48.110 --> 12:49.744
Please, tell me you
just saw that.

12:49.778 --> 12:51.829
I saw you knock
into the counter.

12:51.864 --> 12:53.748
It was nowhere
near the counter!

12:53.782 --> 12:56.734
Sweetie, are you okay?
You seem a little...

12:56.752 --> 12:58.903
I'm fine.
...nervous.

12:58.921 --> 13:01.038
No, I'm not.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.574
I bet I know what it is.

13:03.592 --> 13:06.511
- You do? - You're having second thoughts
about the wedding.

13:06.545 --> 13:08.963
You're the one having
second thoughts, Mom, not me.

13:09.014 --> 13:11.182
I just don't know
what the hurry is.

13:11.216 --> 13:13.634
You're very young,
you barely know him.

13:13.685 --> 13:14.635
What's the rush?

13:14.686 --> 13:16.971
The rush is she has no idea

13:17.022 --> 13:18.973
what she actually wants
to do with her life,

13:19.024 --> 13:20.942
and getting married feels like
doing something with her life.

13:20.976 --> 13:22.693
Even if it's the wrong thing.

13:22.728 --> 13:24.862
Hey, I am perfectly happy
doing what I'm doing.

13:24.897 --> 13:26.280
I like being a bartender.

13:26.315 --> 13:29.116
I bring joy and drunkenness
to people in need.

13:29.151 --> 13:31.903
Plus I am in love
with Dash Gardiner.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.104
I've never felt this
way about anyone.

13:34.122 --> 13:35.156
I know this is right.

13:35.207 --> 13:36.574
We belong together.

13:36.608 --> 13:37.992
And I don't care
what you guys think.

13:38.043 --> 13:39.627
Freya, I just want to be sure

13:39.661 --> 13:42.112
that you're thinking
this thing through.

13:42.130 --> 13:43.831
Dash travels a lot for work.

13:43.882 --> 13:45.082
How are you gonna handle that?

13:45.116 --> 13:46.801
So, you think I'm
cheating on him?

13:48.921 --> 13:50.137
What are you talking about?

13:50.172 --> 13:51.288
Nobody said that.

13:51.306 --> 13:52.840
I have to go see Dash.

14:01.350 --> 14:04.802
Wow...

14:04.820 --> 14:08.239
I must admit,
I hate leaving you...

14:08.273 --> 14:10.825
but I do love our good-byes.

14:13.645 --> 14:16.781
Why do you have to go
halfway around the world?

14:16.815 --> 14:18.332
Can't you be a Doctor
Without Borders here?

14:18.367 --> 14:20.201
I won't be gone that long.

14:20.252 --> 14:21.813
I promise I'll cut back
on the traveling

14:21.820 --> 14:23.621
once we're married, okay?

14:23.655 --> 14:25.990
Okay.

14:26.008 --> 14:27.324
I don't want
to be away from you.

14:27.342 --> 14:29.594
I hate it.

14:29.628 --> 14:31.095
Maybe we go to Vegas.

14:31.129 --> 14:32.162
We'll just do it.

14:32.180 --> 14:33.340
Or I could come on your trip.

14:33.348 --> 14:34.832
We could elope.

14:34.850 --> 14:38.219
You worried you're gonna
change your mind?

14:38.270 --> 14:40.972
I will never change my mind.

14:41.006 --> 14:43.007
Neither will I.

14:54.319 --> 14:56.654
Good morning, Jim.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.656
Morning.

15:29.354 --> 15:32.023
<i>Mysticum flamma</i>
<i>aperire pictura...</i>

15:32.057 --> 15:34.992
<i>Mysticum flamma</i>
<i>aperire pictura...</i>

15:35.027 --> 15:36.160
<i>Mysticum flamma</i>

15:36.194 --> 15:37.662
<i>aperire pictura...</i>

15:37.696 --> 15:40.031
<i>Mysticum flamma</i>
<i>aperire pictura...</i>

15:40.065 --> 15:43.000
<i>Mysticum flamma</i>
<i>aperire pictura...</i>

15:43.035 --> 15:45.403
<i>Mysticum</i>
<i>flamma aperire pictura...</i>

15:45.437 --> 15:47.071
<i>Mysticum flamma aperire...</i>

16:28.380 --> 16:30.047
Hey, Barbie.
What's up?

16:30.082 --> 16:31.782
Hey.
Hi.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.834
I just talked to the doctor.

16:33.885 --> 16:37.221
And our last try
with IVF failed.

16:37.255 --> 16:39.974
And we don't have enough money
for another round, so...

16:40.008 --> 16:42.176
The doctor said, at this point,

16:42.227 --> 16:44.145
it would take a miracle
to get me pregnant.

16:44.179 --> 16:46.296
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

16:46.314 --> 16:48.015
Is there anything I can do?

16:49.184 --> 16:51.185
Well, you studied witchcraft.

16:51.236 --> 16:53.303
Do you know any
"get pregnant" spells?

16:53.321 --> 16:56.407
Honey, I studied history,
not how-to,

16:56.441 --> 17:00.161
but if there were such
a thing as real witchcraft,

17:00.195 --> 17:02.446
and I somehow had
the ability to use it,

17:02.480 --> 17:05.332
you would be the first person
I would help.

17:05.367 --> 17:08.152
I know.

17:12.540 --> 17:13.874
Wendy...

17:16.461 --> 17:18.328
You don't look so good.

17:18.346 --> 17:20.013
Well, I died this morning.

17:20.048 --> 17:22.183
So I'm sorry if my
hair isn't perfect.

17:22.217 --> 17:23.834
What are you doing here?

17:23.852 --> 17:25.352
That's a fine welcome you give

17:25.387 --> 17:27.887
your sister you haven't seen
in over a hundred years.

17:27.939 --> 17:29.106
How much money do you need?

17:29.141 --> 17:32.560
Actually, I came here
to save your life.

17:38.096 --> 17:40.430
Okay, okay.

17:40.550 --> 17:41.730
We'll see you tomorrow.

17:41.850 --> 17:43.679
Oh, my God, my butt

17:43.730 --> 17:45.564
is like eating my underwear.

17:45.599 --> 17:46.492
Hi.

17:46.789 --> 17:47.520
Hey.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.588
Hey.
Um...

17:49.708 --> 17:52.733
listen, I'm really sorry for
rushing out the other night.

17:52.870 --> 17:54.086
I realize I didn't
even say good-bye,

17:54.121 --> 17:55.821
which was very rude
of me, and...

17:55.839 --> 17:56.923
No, it's okay.

17:56.957 --> 17:58.090
You're a cop.

17:58.125 --> 17:59.658
If someone gets
brutally murdered,

17:59.676 --> 18:01.093
you get a pass.

18:01.128 --> 18:03.267
So, how's
the investigation coming?

18:03.387 --> 18:05.047
Well, actually,
that's why I'm here.

18:05.098 --> 18:07.266
I know you know a lot about
occult stuff, and, well,

18:07.301 --> 18:08.667
there was this, uh,

18:08.685 --> 18:10.636
weird symbol, uh, in the gravel

18:10.670 --> 18:12.021
where the bodies were found.

18:12.055 --> 18:14.273
I thought maybe you'd know
what it meant.

18:14.308 --> 18:16.342
Uh, I-I have to warn you,
these are, uh...

18:16.360 --> 18:17.693
these are graphic.

18:18.695 --> 18:20.730
Whoa!

18:20.781 --> 18:22.114
Yeah.

18:22.149 --> 18:23.849
Gruesome, I know.

18:23.867 --> 18:26.702
Do... do you recognize
the symbol?

18:26.737 --> 18:28.788
It almost looks like a mixture

18:28.822 --> 18:30.689
of several I recognize,

18:30.707 --> 18:33.292
but they're all
from different cultures.

18:33.327 --> 18:35.361
This is really strange.

18:35.379 --> 18:36.829
Can I keep this?

18:36.863 --> 18:38.915
I could check
some books if you want.

18:38.966 --> 18:40.299
Yeah.

18:40.334 --> 18:41.415
Yeah, that-that'd be great.

18:41.418 --> 18:43.052
And, uh, and then...

18:43.086 --> 18:46.973
maybe we could, um,
discuss it over coffee?

18:47.007 --> 18:48.174
Sure.

18:48.208 --> 18:49.258
Great.

18:49.309 --> 18:52.094
Bye, Ingrid.

18:55.382 --> 18:58.234
How you doing, lady?

18:58.268 --> 19:00.719
Okay, I have an idea.

19:00.737 --> 19:02.154
And it's incredibly stupid,

19:02.189 --> 19:03.689
and I can't believe
I'm suggesting it,

19:03.723 --> 19:06.325
but do you want to try
a fertility spell?

19:06.360 --> 19:07.860
Are you serious?

19:07.894 --> 19:09.362
Look, I'm still a
rational skeptic,

19:09.396 --> 19:11.364
but what the hell, it might
be kind of fun, right?

19:11.398 --> 19:13.115
Hey, you want to help
us cast a magic spell

19:13.166 --> 19:14.834
to try to get Barb pregnant?

19:14.868 --> 19:17.203
Only if I can make hats.

19:17.237 --> 19:19.255
I can't believe
I got hit by a car.

19:19.289 --> 19:22.408
That's almost as dumb as
the time I died from syphilis.

19:22.426 --> 19:24.427
So how many?

19:24.461 --> 19:25.928
Lives do I have left?

19:25.963 --> 19:27.443
I don't know... a few.
Who keeps count?

19:27.464 --> 19:29.265
Well, I would,
if I only had nine.

19:29.299 --> 19:31.183
Well, you deal with your curses

19:31.218 --> 19:32.718
and I'll deal with mine.

19:34.805 --> 19:37.139
Joanna, I hate your clothes.

19:37.190 --> 19:38.430
You know, for a
supposed artist,

19:38.442 --> 19:40.026
you dress like a schoolteacher.

19:40.060 --> 19:41.427
I am a schoolteacher.

19:41.445 --> 19:43.396
I teach art.

19:43.430 --> 19:45.231
Oh, sorry.

19:45.265 --> 19:47.366
You know, I'm actually surprised
that you let me in.

19:47.401 --> 19:49.735
Every time I call lately,
you hang up.

19:49.769 --> 19:50.820
Lately?

19:50.871 --> 19:53.739
You haven't called since 1972.

19:53.773 --> 19:56.158
Well, I got sick of trying.

19:56.209 --> 19:57.960
Plus I've been busy.
I moved to New Orleans.

19:57.995 --> 19:59.712
I opened up this
cute little voodoo shop

19:59.746 --> 20:00.779
in the French Quarter.

20:00.797 --> 20:03.115
I got married, I got divorced,

20:03.133 --> 20:04.717
I got married again,
I got widowed,

20:04.751 --> 20:06.118
I got eaten by a crocodile.

20:06.136 --> 20:07.720
I'm not even kidding
about that.

20:07.754 --> 20:10.172
Plus I've been keeping
an eye on you from afar.

20:10.223 --> 20:11.457
Even though you hate me.

20:11.475 --> 20:13.726
I don't hate you.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.845
I-I was just mad.

20:15.896 --> 20:18.147
Anyway, I haven't seen
you in a century,

20:18.181 --> 20:20.132
and suddenly you
turn up half-naked

20:20.150 --> 20:23.102
on my doorstep,
telling me I'm in danger.

20:23.136 --> 20:24.503
Care to elaborate?

20:24.538 --> 20:26.298
Oh, yeah, I was getting
to that, but first...

20:26.306 --> 20:28.274
where are the girls?
We're gonna need their help.

20:31.078 --> 20:32.811
No, no. No way.

20:32.829 --> 20:35.498
Whatever this is, I'm
keeping them out of it.

20:35.532 --> 20:37.033
And no magic while you're here.

20:37.084 --> 20:38.000
House rules.

20:38.035 --> 20:39.251
What are you talking about?

20:39.286 --> 20:41.754
The girls don't know
what they are.

20:41.788 --> 20:43.005
What do you mean
they don't know?

20:43.040 --> 20:44.507
I didn't tell them this time.

20:44.541 --> 20:46.125
How could you not tell them?

20:46.159 --> 20:49.045
I wanted to see if
I could change their fate.

20:49.096 --> 20:50.463
You can't change fate.

20:50.497 --> 20:51.847
That's why they call it fate.

20:51.882 --> 20:52.932
It's fated.

20:52.966 --> 20:54.884
I just got sick of it.

20:54.935 --> 20:56.835
The endless cycle.

20:56.853 --> 20:59.171
<i>I watched my girls grow up...</i>

20:59.189 --> 21:02.308
<i>grow into their gifts...</i>

21:02.342 --> 21:06.845
<i>And then,</i>
<i>they die because of them.</i>

21:06.863 --> 21:09.315
<i>And before I'm even</i>
<i>done mourning,</i>

21:09.349 --> 21:11.951
<i>the cycle starts up again.</i>

21:11.985 --> 21:14.520
<i>I'm suddenly</i>
<i>nine months pregnant</i>

21:14.538 --> 21:16.188
<i>with Ingrid.</i>

21:16.206 --> 21:18.991
<i>And then soon after</i>
<i>comes Freya.</i>

21:19.025 --> 21:21.293
<i>And once again</i>
<i>my girls grow up.</i>

21:21.328 --> 21:23.212
<i>They practice magic.</i>

21:23.246 --> 21:24.797
<i>Then one way</i>

21:24.831 --> 21:25.881
<i>or another...</i>

21:25.916 --> 21:27.967
<i>they die by its hand...</i>

21:28.001 --> 21:31.370
<i>over and over...</i>

21:31.388 --> 21:33.422
<i>and over...</i>

21:33.473 --> 21:35.257
<i>and over.</i>

21:35.308 --> 21:39.044
<i>I've given birth to them</i>
<i>and watched them die</i>

21:39.062 --> 21:43.215
a dozen times and neither
of them's ever lived past 30.

21:43.233 --> 21:44.817
I am sick of it.

21:44.851 --> 21:47.820
I decided this life,
for once, they'd be normal.

21:47.854 --> 21:49.939
So you're denying them
their birthright?

21:49.990 --> 21:51.824
I'm trying to give
them something

21:51.858 --> 21:54.893
they have never, ever had,

21:54.911 --> 21:57.563
not in hundreds of years
of so-called immortality:

21:57.581 --> 22:00.399
a long and happy life.

22:00.417 --> 22:02.401
And you think you're cursed.

22:02.419 --> 22:03.902
At least you got
to have children.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.372
Having children is my curse.

22:06.406 --> 22:09.175
You can't hide their
powers forever, Joanna.

22:09.209 --> 22:11.544
They're gonna come out
one way or another,

22:11.578 --> 22:13.629
whether you want
them to or not.

22:20.637 --> 22:22.221
Be right with you, buddy.

22:22.255 --> 22:23.973
I'm trying to make
this jar of olives

22:24.024 --> 22:25.524
explode with my mind.

22:28.595 --> 22:32.148
♪ Never meant to start a fire

22:34.534 --> 22:36.869
So you just gonna
stand there scowling at me,

22:36.903 --> 22:38.103
or can I have a drink?

22:39.272 --> 22:40.573
What can I get you, sir?

22:40.607 --> 22:42.575
What do you recommend?
I recommend

22:42.609 --> 22:44.076
you leave now
and never come back.

22:45.495 --> 22:47.613
Why don't you make me
the house special?

22:47.631 --> 22:49.281
I hear you're an artist,

22:49.299 --> 22:51.917
that your drinks are
practically... aphrodisiacs.

22:51.951 --> 22:53.118
Well, but then
you'll just end up

22:53.136 --> 22:54.220
all hot and bothered,

22:54.254 --> 22:55.921
and alone and frustrated.

22:55.955 --> 22:58.290
I'm already frustrated.

22:58.308 --> 23:00.259
Get used to it.

23:02.596 --> 23:04.897
So I'm staying in my boat.

23:04.931 --> 23:06.298
Docked down at Fair Haven.

23:06.316 --> 23:08.184
Little bit cramped,

23:08.235 --> 23:10.302
but I think we'll make do.
What are you talking about?

23:10.320 --> 23:12.104
You're coming by
after your shift, yeah?

23:13.323 --> 23:15.441
No.
Why not?

23:15.475 --> 23:16.909
Because I'm engaged
to your brother.

23:16.943 --> 23:18.661
Didn't seem
to stop you last night.

23:18.695 --> 23:20.996
That was a momentary lapse.

23:21.031 --> 23:22.615
I bet you have a lot of those.

23:22.649 --> 23:23.666
Go to hell.

23:42.335 --> 23:45.304
Um... we're not
gonna, like,

23:45.338 --> 23:47.940
awaken any evil
spirits, are we?

23:47.974 --> 23:49.225
First of all, this
is white magic,

23:49.276 --> 23:50.442
not black magic.

23:50.477 --> 23:52.511
And secondly,
there's no such thing

23:52.529 --> 23:55.681
as any kind of magic,
so I'm guessing not.

23:55.699 --> 23:57.233
Oh...
Okay.

23:57.284 --> 23:58.367
Yes.

23:58.401 --> 24:00.703
So it says here
we should join hands

24:00.737 --> 24:03.322
around Barb...
Mm-hmm.

24:03.356 --> 24:06.024
and do the chant
while she massages

24:06.042 --> 24:07.025
her uterus.

24:07.043 --> 24:09.328
Here we go.

24:09.362 --> 24:14.366
<i>Nostri incantatores</i>
<i>facit fertilis semen...</i>

24:15.669 --> 24:17.035
Uh... "semen."

24:17.053 --> 24:18.087
What are you, 12?

24:18.138 --> 24:19.672
It's Latin.
It means "seed."

24:19.706 --> 24:22.207
Ew.
Are we doing this or not?

24:22.225 --> 24:25.311
Suddenly, Miss
I'm-Too-Good-For-Witchcraft

24:25.345 --> 24:26.979
is kind of getting
into the witchcraft.

24:27.013 --> 24:28.213
I believe if you do something,

24:28.214 --> 24:29.398
you should do it right.

24:29.432 --> 24:31.233
Now, come on.

24:31.268 --> 24:35.237
<i>Nostri incantatores</i>
<i>facit fertilis semen.</i>

24:35.272 --> 24:37.523
<i>Nostri incantatores</i>

24:37.557 --> 24:39.108
<i>facit fertilis semen.</i>

24:39.159 --> 24:42.077
<i>Nostri incantatores facit</i>

24:42.112 --> 24:43.529
<i>fertilis semen...</i>

24:45.532 --> 24:47.750
Shouldn't there be,
like, flashes of light?

24:47.784 --> 24:50.169
Or a puff of smoke,
or something?

24:50.203 --> 24:53.038
From the fake spell
we got off the Internet?

24:54.040 --> 24:55.207
I'm bored.

24:55.241 --> 24:56.508
You guys want to go
grab a drink

24:56.543 --> 24:57.710
at the Bent Elbow?
Yes.

24:57.744 --> 24:59.094
Totally.
Please.

24:59.129 --> 25:00.346
Hey.

25:10.056 --> 25:11.256
I know you've been angry at me

25:11.257 --> 25:12.358
these past hundred years.

25:12.392 --> 25:14.059
Why would I be angry at you?

25:14.093 --> 25:15.427
You only killed
my eldest daughter.

25:15.445 --> 25:16.729
It was an accident.

25:16.763 --> 25:18.397
Plus, Ingrid was reborn.

25:18.431 --> 25:20.065
It's never the same.

25:20.099 --> 25:21.499
She's always a little
bit different.

25:21.534 --> 25:22.701
And every time I lose them,

25:22.736 --> 25:24.153
it gets a little bit harder.

25:24.204 --> 25:25.621
Oh, don't even act
like your curse

25:25.655 --> 25:27.039
isn't way better than mine.

25:27.073 --> 25:28.490
Oh, here we go...

25:28.541 --> 25:30.659
Immortality?
Is that really even a curse?

25:30.710 --> 25:33.128
Immortality with
endless motherhood.

25:33.163 --> 25:35.047
Do you know how many times

25:35.081 --> 25:36.782
I gave birth before they
invented the epidural?

25:36.800 --> 25:38.384
Not to mention soap.

25:38.418 --> 25:39.501
All right,

25:39.552 --> 25:41.086
but even though you're "cursed"

25:41.120 --> 25:42.421
with immortality,

25:42.455 --> 25:44.306
you're not really immortal,
are you, Joanna?

25:44.341 --> 25:45.758
I mean, if somebody
wanted to kill you,

25:45.792 --> 25:47.509
really wanted to kill
you, they could.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.727
Even with your girls,

25:48.762 --> 25:50.295
the right spell
in the wrong hands

25:50.313 --> 25:52.097
could not only kill
Freya and Ingrid,

25:52.131 --> 25:54.099
but it could stop them
from being reborn.

25:54.133 --> 25:56.134
What are you getting at?
Put out your cards.

25:56.152 --> 25:57.853
I don't know where they are.
Yeah, you do.

26:04.327 --> 26:06.078
I had a dream about you

26:06.112 --> 26:07.279
the other night.

26:07.313 --> 26:09.615
Your eyes were green,
they were glowing,

26:09.649 --> 26:11.333
because it wasn't you,
it was a shifter,

26:11.368 --> 26:12.651
somebody doing evil
in your name.

26:12.669 --> 26:14.503
When I awoke,
I dealt a deck for you.

26:16.122 --> 26:17.489
I couldn't believe what I saw.

26:17.507 --> 26:18.674
I thought I made a mistake,

26:18.708 --> 26:20.709
so I dealt them again,

26:20.760 --> 26:22.211
and again, and again.

26:22.262 --> 26:23.629
Every time, the same thing.

26:23.663 --> 26:26.498
This can't be right.

26:26.516 --> 26:28.100
Look here. The Impostor.

26:28.134 --> 26:29.601
Look at the eyes.

26:29.636 --> 26:31.770
And here, the cloak pulled back.

26:31.805 --> 26:34.356
I didn't know what that meant
at first, but now I know.

26:34.391 --> 26:36.174
It's the powers that you're
hiding from your daughters.

26:36.192 --> 26:37.693
They're about to be revealed.

26:37.727 --> 26:39.812
The life you built here, Joanna,

26:39.846 --> 26:42.481
it's about to change.
Upheaval, death,

26:42.515 --> 26:44.483
destruction, pain,

26:44.517 --> 26:46.151
imprisonment, betrayal.

26:46.185 --> 26:47.653
It's coming for you.

26:47.687 --> 26:50.188
Like nothing you've ever seen before.
Hold on.

26:50.206 --> 26:51.707
Don't get dramatic.

26:51.741 --> 26:54.159
You're always so damn dramatic.

27:03.636 --> 27:06.221
N... No, no, no, no, no.

27:21.438 --> 27:23.272
This isn't happening.

27:23.323 --> 27:25.724
your enemy.

27:25.742 --> 27:28.622
The one who can make themselves look like you.
From the lay of the cards,

27:28.661 --> 27:30.696
it looks like they don't have
the tools to kill you quite yet.

27:30.730 --> 27:32.581
They're still searching,
so that gives us some time.

27:32.615 --> 27:34.450
Do you have any idea
who it might be?

27:34.501 --> 27:36.735
I have absolutely no idea.

27:36.753 --> 27:38.587
You said somebody bought
Fair Haven.

27:38.621 --> 27:40.506
The boy who's marrying Freya?

27:40.540 --> 27:41.757
No, he's mortal.

27:41.791 --> 27:43.459
How do you know?
Because

27:43.510 --> 27:44.676
I tested him.

27:49.382 --> 27:51.249
Ah!
Oopsie!

27:51.267 --> 27:53.185
Mom, did you just stab
my fiancé?

27:53.219 --> 27:55.888
So clumsy. Let me get
a Band-Aid.

27:55.922 --> 27:57.523
Ow!
What is wrong with you?

27:57.557 --> 27:58.590
Nothing. Be right back.

27:58.608 --> 27:59.942
Baby, I'm sorry.

27:59.976 --> 28:05.263
<i>Dico me est hoc</i>
<i>creatura humana.</i>

28:07.534 --> 28:09.234
<i>The test was definitive.</i>

28:09.268 --> 28:11.787
Dash Gardiner is
just an ordinary man.

28:11.821 --> 28:13.322
Only very rich.

28:13.373 --> 28:14.656
The cards don't lie.

28:14.707 --> 28:16.542
You have an enemy, Joanna.

28:16.576 --> 28:18.410
Somebody who wants to hurt you.

28:18.444 --> 28:20.496
Somebody whose powers
rival your own.

28:20.547 --> 28:23.382
And they're not gonna stop until
you and your girls are dead.

28:23.416 --> 28:24.832
Forever dead.

28:44.913 --> 28:46.380
I knew you'd come.

28:46.414 --> 28:48.165
I knew you'd come.

29:07.134 --> 29:09.302
Why do you look so sad?

29:09.320 --> 29:11.905
Because I've waited 400 years
for this,

29:11.940 --> 29:14.474
and it's not even
really happening.

29:23.952 --> 29:26.787
<i>So you're saying she's crazy?</i>

29:26.821 --> 29:28.422
I'm saying she's eccentric.

29:28.456 --> 29:30.424
Who's eccentric?
Our aunt.

29:30.458 --> 29:32.092
We have an aunt?

29:32.126 --> 29:34.494
I told you guys
about Aunt Wendy.

29:34.512 --> 29:37.047
I'd always just assumed you made
her up as a cautionary tale

29:37.098 --> 29:39.766
about what happens
when sisters fight.

29:39.801 --> 29:41.885
No, she's very real.
She's upstairs

29:41.936 --> 29:43.470
in the attic sleeping.

29:43.504 --> 29:45.856
And you guys should know,
she's... a little off.

29:49.194 --> 29:51.511
She also brought her cat.

29:51.529 --> 29:53.847
Bad cat! If you're not careful,
I'm gonna have you spayed.

29:58.853 --> 30:00.487
I'm a little off, am I?

30:00.521 --> 30:02.539
Look, I do appreciate
you coming to help

30:02.574 --> 30:04.875
with the whole "someone's trying
to kill me" thing.

30:04.909 --> 30:08.495
But the one rule I ask you abide
while you're here is

30:08.529 --> 30:10.363
stay in human form.

30:10.381 --> 30:11.882
And don't involve
the girls in this.

30:11.916 --> 30:13.300
Wait, that's two rules.

30:13.334 --> 30:15.419
put on some clothes.

30:15.470 --> 30:17.037
Were you not paying attention
last night?

30:17.055 --> 30:18.388
The girls are gonna figure out
who they are,

30:18.423 --> 30:19.806
whether you want them to or not.

30:19.841 --> 30:22.059
Not if we stop this
ourselves first.

30:22.093 --> 30:23.560
Now get dressed.

30:23.595 --> 30:25.312
I'm tired of looking
at your nipples.

30:25.346 --> 30:26.897
Well, then find me something
that doesn't make me look

30:26.931 --> 30:29.099
like the old woman
who lived in a shoe.

30:29.150 --> 30:31.235
Do you think it's possible
to have two soul mates?

30:31.269 --> 30:33.386
I don't think it's possible
to have one soul mate.

30:33.404 --> 30:35.239
I think "soul mates" is a
concept Hollywood invented

30:35.273 --> 30:37.241
to sell tickets
to Meg Ryan movies.

30:37.275 --> 30:39.076
Okay. Do you think
it's possible

30:39.110 --> 30:41.028
to be in love with two men at once?
No.

30:41.062 --> 30:44.414
I think romantic love is
a concept Hollywood invented

30:44.449 --> 30:47.067
to sell tickets
to Katherine Heigl movies.

30:47.085 --> 30:48.252
No, you don't.

30:50.588 --> 30:52.572
So who is he?

30:52.590 --> 30:54.541
I just meant hypothetically.

30:54.575 --> 30:57.077
Hypothetically, who is he?

30:57.095 --> 31:00.347
Hypothetically,
he's Dash's brother.

31:00.381 --> 31:02.266
Freya, you didn't.
Oh, I know.

31:02.300 --> 31:05.018
I love Dash.
So much. I do.

31:05.053 --> 31:07.271
He's... safe and warm
and comforting

31:07.305 --> 31:09.139
and familiar and hot

31:09.190 --> 31:11.141
and funny and romantic
and sweet,

31:11.192 --> 31:12.609
and I can totally see myself

31:12.644 --> 31:14.227
spending the rest
of my life with him.

31:14.261 --> 31:15.479
Good. 'Cause you're engaged.

31:15.530 --> 31:16.947
But then there's Killian.

31:16.981 --> 31:19.199
Oh, my God.
And I can't explain it,

31:19.233 --> 31:20.400
but he is like...

31:20.434 --> 31:22.452
lightning bolt passion crazy

31:22.487 --> 31:26.039
amazing awesome
soul mate sexual insanity.

31:26.074 --> 31:28.158
- Oh, Freya. Oh, Freya. - Don't say
"Oh, Freya." Please don't say "Oh, Freya."

31:28.209 --> 31:30.627
I hate it when you say "Oh, Freya"!
Girls,

31:30.662 --> 31:32.579
I want you to meet
your Aunt Wendy.

31:32.613 --> 31:36.282
Freya. Hi, I'm sure you don't remember me,
Hi.

31:36.301 --> 31:38.952
But we met a long time ago.

31:38.970 --> 31:41.138
And, boy, did we have fun.
Oh, well,

31:41.172 --> 31:42.422
please tell me some stories
about Mom

31:42.456 --> 31:43.890
that I can use
against her later.

31:43.925 --> 31:45.175
Oh, honey, I've got a million.

31:46.594 --> 31:48.628
Ingrid.

31:51.182 --> 31:52.149
You look so...

31:52.183 --> 31:53.900
It's really nice

31:53.935 --> 31:55.319
to meet you. I'm
late for work.

31:55.353 --> 31:57.354
I've got to go.

31:58.489 --> 32:00.140
What was that about?

32:00.158 --> 32:02.025
I don't know.

32:02.076 --> 32:04.578
Tell me about this boy Dash.

32:04.612 --> 32:07.447
He's not a boy, Aunt Wendy.
He's a man.

32:07.481 --> 32:09.032
And he's amazing.

32:09.083 --> 32:10.534
But...
But nothing.

32:10.585 --> 32:13.670
He's seriously perfect.
I couldn't be happier.

32:13.705 --> 32:15.422
Or more conflicted.

32:15.456 --> 32:18.425
You love him.
That's very clear.

32:18.459 --> 32:20.677
But you're tempted by another.

32:20.712 --> 32:24.014
Oh, my God. How did you know?

32:24.048 --> 32:26.133
Your aura. It's, like,
12 different colors right now.

32:26.167 --> 32:28.101
You can read auras?
Uh-huh.

32:28.136 --> 32:29.686
I'm very intuitive.
Especially with other w...

32:29.721 --> 32:31.304
family members.

32:31.338 --> 32:32.639
I can read auras, too.

32:32.673 --> 32:35.025
Or at least I can see them.
Sometimes.

32:35.059 --> 32:36.979
I think.
Freya, there's something you should know

32:37.011 --> 32:38.678
about your Aunt Wendy.
She's what people

32:38.696 --> 32:41.198
in the psychiatric profession
call "a flake."

32:41.232 --> 32:43.683
And you shouldn't listen
to anything she says.

32:43.701 --> 32:45.952
Well, I guess I'm a flake, too.
Must run in the family.

32:48.706 --> 32:50.624
You keep messing with my girls,

32:50.658 --> 32:53.243
and that curse on your head'll
be the least of your worries.

32:53.294 --> 32:55.045
What? It's not like
I levitated over

32:55.079 --> 32:56.713
by the zucchini cart
or something.

32:56.748 --> 32:58.131
We're gonna have
to work on getting

32:58.166 --> 33:00.384
that broomstick out
of your ass, babe.

33:04.305 --> 33:06.206
<i>Mysticum flamma aperire</i>
<i>pictura.</i>

33:06.224 --> 33:09.259
<i>Mysticum flamma</i>
<i>aperire pictura.</i>

33:09.310 --> 33:11.228
<i>Mysticum flamma aperire</i>
<i>pictura.</i>

33:11.262 --> 33:13.980
<i>Mysticum flamma</i>
<i>aperire pictura.</i>

33:14.015 --> 33:16.049
<i>Mysticum flamma aperire</i>
<i>pictura.</i>

33:16.067 --> 33:18.268
<i>Mysticum...</i>

33:31.065 --> 33:33.399
If you come with me,

33:33.418 --> 33:37.120
I can help you get revenge on
the witch who did this to you.

33:49.301 --> 33:51.024
Figured my not showing up
at your boat last night

33:51.144 --> 33:52.177
would've been a hint.

33:52.195 --> 33:53.345
It's not why I'm here.

33:53.363 --> 33:54.863
Conceited.

33:54.898 --> 33:56.148
Look, I decided we
should be friends.

33:56.182 --> 33:57.834
You want to be friends?

33:57.954 --> 33:59.421
Well, you are
marrying my brother,

33:59.455 --> 34:00.710
so in a way we're
practically family.

34:00.823 --> 34:02.607
We should at least be friends.

34:02.658 --> 34:03.991
Hang out, get to
know each other.

34:04.026 --> 34:05.549
Platonically, of course.

34:05.669 --> 34:06.944
I don't really think

34:06.995 --> 34:09.163
that's a good idea.
I get it.

34:09.197 --> 34:11.498
You're afraid you won't be able
to keep your hands off me.

34:11.533 --> 34:13.034
In your dreams.

34:13.068 --> 34:17.088
True, but I promise
to be a gentleman.

34:18.543 --> 34:21.092
All right, I'm game.

34:21.126 --> 34:22.960
Cool.

34:23.011 --> 34:24.629
We'll be friends.

34:24.679 --> 34:26.547
You'll marry Dash
then spend the rest

34:26.581 --> 34:27.882
of your life wondering what it
would've been like with me.

34:27.916 --> 34:28.916
I'm sorry.

34:28.934 --> 34:30.551
Who's the conceited one?

34:30.585 --> 34:32.303
At least that's what
I'll be doing anyway.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.724
So, can I get a drink or what?

34:36.757 --> 34:38.109
Pal.

34:38.143 --> 34:39.560
All right, chill out, buddy.

34:39.594 --> 34:41.646
I'll go make you something.

34:41.697 --> 34:44.649
♪ Yeah

34:44.699 --> 34:47.702
♪ Yeah...

34:49.987 --> 34:51.956
Hey, where have
you been all day?

34:51.989 --> 34:54.775
Freaking out.
Why?

34:57.045 --> 34:58.162
Wait, did you pee on this?

34:58.213 --> 34:59.964
Yah-ha!

34:59.998 --> 35:01.299
I mean, you don't think...

35:01.333 --> 35:04.218
What, that it was the spell?

35:04.253 --> 35:06.637
The doctor did say
that it would take a miracle.

35:06.672 --> 35:09.974
Okay, besides the fact that
we got it off a Web site

35:10.008 --> 35:12.009
that misspelled both
the words "fertility"

35:12.060 --> 35:13.678
and the word "spell,"

35:13.729 --> 35:15.680
it's way too fast for
that to have worked.

35:15.731 --> 35:18.766
Well, all I know is,
yesterday I wasn't pregnant,

35:18.800 --> 35:20.301
and then we did that spell,

35:20.319 --> 35:23.821
and then Bob and I...
you know... twice,

35:23.856 --> 35:26.574
and then I went to sleep
and I had this dream.

35:26.608 --> 35:27.775
You were there.

35:27.809 --> 35:30.945
You were handing me my baby.

35:30.979 --> 35:32.947
But that was just a dream.

35:32.981 --> 35:34.115
I know it was,

35:34.149 --> 35:36.334
and it seems crazy,
but it also feels

35:36.368 --> 35:38.085
kind of true, too, doesn't it?

35:38.120 --> 35:40.621
Like, if this were
a movie, right now

35:40.655 --> 35:41.789
would be the moment

35:41.823 --> 35:43.591
where the girl who thought
she was ordinary

35:43.625 --> 35:45.927
finds out she's actually magic

35:45.961 --> 35:49.130
and the power was
within her all along.

35:50.716 --> 35:53.017
I, I have to go.

35:53.051 --> 35:54.352
Hey.

35:54.386 --> 35:56.854
Well, what are, what
are you so upset about?

35:58.857 --> 36:00.358
Yes.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.642
Drink up.

36:01.676 --> 36:02.977
You are kicking my ass.

36:04.179 --> 36:07.031
Never play darts
against a bartender.

36:07.065 --> 36:09.350
♪ You got me with your fingers
on my throat ♪

36:09.368 --> 36:11.619
♪ And my head on the floor...

36:11.653 --> 36:13.321
See, I, for one, think
this whole platonic thing

36:13.355 --> 36:15.873
is going great.

36:15.908 --> 36:18.025
It's not, not torture at all.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.629
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

or how hot he is.

36:32.874 --> 36:34.392
Keep it friendly, Freya.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.060
Friendly friends.

36:37.396 --> 36:40.264
Whoa, hey, ladies' room.

36:40.315 --> 36:41.649
Uh, <i>ocupado,</i> buddy.

36:41.683 --> 36:42.934
Hello, Freya.

36:42.985 --> 36:44.685
Hi, stranger.

36:44.719 --> 36:46.654
You have quite
the sunburn there.

36:46.688 --> 36:48.722
You know, I'd put
some aloe on that ASAP.

36:48.740 --> 36:51.659
She said that
you'd be different,

36:51.693 --> 36:53.077
that you wouldn't remember me.

36:53.111 --> 36:54.278
Who said?

36:54.329 --> 36:55.913
My benefactor.

36:55.948 --> 36:58.899
She really hates your
family, even more than I do.

36:58.917 --> 37:02.203
She said that I could
have you as my toy,

37:02.237 --> 37:03.871
that I could do whatever
I want with you.

37:05.240 --> 37:06.707
You're not the,
not the same Freya,

37:06.741 --> 37:09.293
but you're still Freya.

37:09.344 --> 37:11.379
Okay, I think
you have me confused

37:11.413 --> 37:12.680
with a different Freya.

37:12.714 --> 37:14.432
It's a very common name.

37:14.466 --> 37:16.934
I asked you

37:16.969 --> 37:20.187
to be my bride,
and you rejected me.

37:20.222 --> 37:22.256
All I did

37:22.274 --> 37:25.776
was get a little bit angry,
and what did you do?

37:25.811 --> 37:30.364
You stuck me in a
desert for 80 years!

37:30.399 --> 37:32.199
Well, guess what.

37:32.234 --> 37:34.435
I'm gonna do a lot more
than hit you this time.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.704
Killian, somebody!

37:36.738 --> 37:40.124
♪ Take what you came here for

37:40.158 --> 37:41.709

37:41.743 --> 37:42.943

Help me!

37:44.296 --> 37:45.779
Quiet.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.331
Oh, God, just let me go.

37:47.382 --> 37:48.466
Just let me go, please.

37:50.135 --> 37:53.137
My magic is a little bit rusty,

37:53.171 --> 37:54.955
and I was never as
talented as you,

37:54.973 --> 37:57.958
which is why you're gonna be
the one to cast the spell.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.010
Take this.
Uh...

38:00.479 --> 38:02.296
I'm gonna cast a magic spell
with a scented candle?

38:02.314 --> 38:04.398
Yes, we are.

38:04.433 --> 38:07.151
Okay, take a deep breath.

38:07.185 --> 38:08.469
Repeat after me.

38:08.487 --> 38:11.155
<i>Mysticum pictura devorare nos.</i>

38:11.189 --> 38:12.773
I don't speak that.

38:12.807 --> 38:14.475
Yes, you do,
Freya, yes, you do,

38:14.493 --> 38:15.943
Now say it.

38:15.977 --> 38:19.914
<i>Mysticum pictura devorare nos.</i>

38:35.464 --> 38:39.216
<i>Mysticum pictura devorare nos.</i>
What?

38:41.336 --> 38:43.971
Hey, I'm making a vision stew.
I used this once

38:44.005 --> 38:46.273
to track down an old boyfriend
of mine who owed me money.

38:46.308 --> 38:48.526
Thought we could use it
to find our imposter.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.444
It's in the peyote family,
so don't be alarmed

38:50.479 --> 38:51.512
if the walls start breathing.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.314
Do you want a taste?

39:18.696 --> 39:21.198
Freya, did you fall in?

39:21.232 --> 39:23.817
Freya.

39:23.868 --> 39:25.819
Freya?

39:25.870 --> 39:27.704
Freya.

39:27.739 --> 39:29.907
♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh

39:29.941 --> 39:31.942
♪ So what you gonna say now?

39:37.715 --> 39:39.716
Thanks.

39:41.285 --> 39:44.888
I heard you were ready
to talk to me.

39:44.923 --> 39:47.808
I know who killed my husband.

39:52.847 --> 39:55.232
Oh, my God, what happened?

39:55.266 --> 39:56.567
You stabbed me.

39:56.601 --> 39:58.402
Plus I think I
ruined your towel.

39:58.436 --> 40:00.270
Okay, it's okay,
I can fix this.

40:00.304 --> 40:02.523
I can do a healing spell.
No, no, no, wait, no, no, it's too late.

40:02.574 --> 40:03.690
Listen to me.

40:03.741 --> 40:04.825
The imposter...
she's real.

40:04.859 --> 40:06.777
I was right; she
looks like you.

40:06.811 --> 40:08.529
I managed to eat some
stew after she left.

40:08.580 --> 40:09.663
I had a vision.

40:09.697 --> 40:10.818
Oh, man, walls are breathing.

40:10.832 --> 40:11.915
Holy shit.

40:11.950 --> 40:14.701
Listen, you have to save Freya.

40:14.752 --> 40:16.753
The bar where she
works... in the bathroom,

40:16.788 --> 40:18.005
there's a picture.

40:18.039 --> 40:20.257
An old lover of
hers wants revenge.

40:20.291 --> 40:21.291
Guys, what the hell is going on?

40:21.325 --> 40:22.543
Shh.

40:22.594 --> 40:23.710
He's going to
take her in there.

40:23.761 --> 40:25.495
He wants to kill
her in the picture

40:25.513 --> 40:26.930
because he knows if he does...

40:26.965 --> 40:28.298
She can't be reborn.

40:28.332 --> 40:30.684
I wish I could help you.

40:30.718 --> 40:33.503
I don't understand

40:33.521 --> 40:34.855
what's happening.

40:34.889 --> 40:35.856
We don't have much time.

40:35.890 --> 40:37.608
We have to help your sister,

40:37.642 --> 40:39.026
but first there's something
I need to tell you.

40:39.060 --> 40:41.511
It's the truth
about who we are.

40:41.529 --> 40:43.680
Please don't tell me we're witches.
We're witches.

40:43.698 --> 40:45.899
When you were little, I
put a spell on you girls

40:45.950 --> 40:48.368
so you wouldn't figure
out what we were.

40:48.403 --> 40:51.455
It barely worked on Freya,
but it worked too well on you.

40:51.489 --> 40:53.356
Freya knew and you lied to her.

40:53.374 --> 40:55.325
You sent her to therapy.

40:55.359 --> 40:57.461
Oh, my God, she is going
to be so pissed.

40:57.495 --> 40:58.662
Only if we can save her.

40:58.696 --> 40:59.663
I don't believe you.

40:59.697 --> 41:00.864
I am a rational skeptic.

41:00.882 --> 41:02.382
I am a wallflower.

41:02.417 --> 41:05.552
Baby, no, you're magic.

41:07.038 --> 41:09.506
Oh, this isn't happening.

41:09.540 --> 41:12.509
Wendy.

41:19.050 --> 41:21.018
Detective Noble.

41:21.052 --> 41:22.686
Joanna Beauchamp,
you are under arrest

41:22.720 --> 41:24.054
for the murder of Bill Thatcher

41:24.072 --> 41:25.689
and the attempted murder
of Maura Thatcher.

41:25.723 --> 41:27.407
You have the right to remain silent.
Wait,

41:27.442 --> 41:28.825
Adam, what the hell?

41:28.860 --> 41:30.077
She was positively I.D.'d
by the victim.

41:30.111 --> 41:31.495
I'm sorry.

41:31.529 --> 41:32.896
Mom.

41:32.914 --> 41:34.448
You have to save your sister.

41:34.499 --> 41:36.399
You're the only one
who can do it.

41:36.417 --> 41:38.669
Please don't tell me the power
was within me all along.

41:38.703 --> 41:39.670
The breakfront

41:39.704 --> 41:41.071
has a false back.

41:41.089 --> 41:43.006
You'll find
everything you need inside.

41:43.041 --> 41:46.543
Ingrid, hurry, please.
