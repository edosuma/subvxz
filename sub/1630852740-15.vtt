00:01.653 --> 00:04.613
<i>Tonight we check in
with fan favorite Justin Jedlica</i>

00:04.656 --> 00:06.223
<i>and you won't believe</i> <i>
what he's done to his body.</i>

00:06.267 --> 00:08.312
I'm back to show off
to the doctors

00:08.356 --> 00:10.401
my 8-piece leg implant surgery.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.186
I kind of get off on the fact
that I'm doing things

00:12.229 --> 00:13.839
that nobody else
has done before.

00:13.883 --> 00:16.581
What you did with the penis,
did it increase in size?

00:16.625 --> 00:19.976
Girth, for sure. There's, like,
a bungee cord...

00:20.020 --> 00:21.630
- That pulls on it?
- That goes, and you attach it

00:21.673 --> 00:22.718
to the bottom of your penis...
- Ow!

00:22.761 --> 00:24.067
- ...and it pulls.
- Really?

00:24.111 --> 00:25.329
God!

00:25.373 --> 00:27.462
I mean, you're stretching
the ligament.

00:27.505 --> 00:30.334
<i>A nose patient</i> <i>
whose dreams were shattered</i>

00:30.378 --> 00:32.249
<i>because of</i> <i>
her bad plastic surgery.</i>

00:32.293 --> 00:35.513
I wanted to be famous
and be a telenovela star,

00:35.557 --> 00:37.950
but I didn't have a nose
that was perfect.

00:37.994 --> 00:42.172
The unknown is the quality of
the skin and the blood supply.

00:42.216 --> 00:44.044
Because if we kill your skin,

00:44.087 --> 00:45.741
there's really no way
of going back.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.786
<i>And a patient</i> <i>
has something big</i>

00:47.830 --> 00:49.092
<i>to get off her chest.</i>

00:49.136 --> 00:51.747
I have what I like to call
Triple T's--

00:51.790 --> 00:53.357
terrible Tijuana titties.

00:53.401 --> 00:56.404
The only way that we can
possibly fix this

00:56.447 --> 00:59.450
is try
to stitch everything down,

00:59.494 --> 01:05.500
then we can go back and put some
appropriately sized implants in.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.197
- Oh.
- 2-part is--I thought we were

01:07.241 --> 01:09.199
doing one part.
- 2-part? It might be 5-part.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.071
No, we don't want that.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.942
<i>♪ I wanna be sexy</i>

01:14.248 --> 01:16.380
<i>♪ I wanna be hot, hot</i>

01:16.424 --> 01:20.123
<i>♪ Fix me, make me beautiful</i>

01:21.342 --> 01:24.084
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

01:24.127 --> 01:26.390

01:26.434 --> 01:28.653
<i>♪ Do what you want, yeah</i>

01:28.697 --> 01:30.394
Oh, yeah.

01:30.438 --> 01:31.961
My boobs not gonna fit in that.

01:32.004 --> 01:33.267
- How would it not?
- Look.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.225
Really? Look at that.

01:35.269 --> 01:37.140
My name is Shantel.
I'm 31 years old,

01:37.184 --> 01:39.273
and I'm
from San Diego, California.

01:39.316 --> 01:42.232
I have what I like to call
triple T's--

01:42.276 --> 01:44.016
terrible Tijuana titties.

01:44.060 --> 01:48.673
My breasts look like deformed,
huge, ugly watermelons

01:48.717 --> 01:51.937
that are, like,
melting to the ground.

01:51.981 --> 01:52.938
Ooh.

01:52.982 --> 01:54.375
Ooh, don't "ooh" me.

01:54.418 --> 01:55.550
- Do you see--
- That looks good.

01:55.593 --> 01:56.768
Do you see what's going on here?

01:56.812 --> 01:58.727
- What?
- Look, there's nothing here.

01:58.770 --> 02:02.078
My boob is down here.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.863
So it's been three years
since my surgery in Tijuana,

02:04.907 --> 02:07.779
and for them to be
this misshapen and deformed,

02:07.823 --> 02:11.174
it really just sucks 'cause it's
like I feel defeated.

02:11.218 --> 02:15.787
I feel like, mentally, you know,
it really plays on your psyche

02:15.831 --> 02:17.920
because it makes me feel
so insecure.

02:17.963 --> 02:22.490
It's supposed to be somewhat
like that...not that.

02:22.533 --> 02:25.362
I'm in a relationship with
someone I love and care about,

02:25.406 --> 02:27.234
and a year ago, Bryce and I

02:27.277 --> 02:29.366
welcomed our first baby girl together.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.194
I just wanna be happy,
but instead, you know,

02:31.238 --> 02:35.459
I hate myself 'cause I'm so
embarrassed and ashamed and mad.

02:35.503 --> 02:38.897
- God, I keep looking at 'em.
- Focus up here, up here.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.072
I understand what you're saying,

02:40.116 --> 02:41.552
but you don't ever let me
see 'em.

02:41.596 --> 02:45.121
How would you like it if
half your balls were deformed?

02:45.165 --> 02:47.297
Bryce is just always trying
to find creative ways,

02:47.341 --> 02:49.473
you know,
to get intimate nowadays,

02:49.517 --> 02:53.042
but I know he doesn't like
my breasts,

02:53.085 --> 02:55.349
but no matter what,
he's gonna tell me he does

02:55.392 --> 02:57.264
to not hurt my feelings.

02:57.307 --> 02:58.743
What I usually wear
during intimate moments

02:58.787 --> 03:03.661
is one of Bryce's shirts
or a muumuu of some sort.

03:03.705 --> 03:07.230
You know, easy access,
but you know, fully covered.

03:08.753 --> 03:11.191
I want 'em up and a little bit
closer to together.

03:11.234 --> 03:13.236
You know what I mean?
And looking at the same person.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.457
You know, right now they're
kinda, like, lopsided, you know?

03:16.500 --> 03:18.023
They never looked at me.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.939
They will one day, maybe.

03:28.469 --> 03:31.211
My name is Claudia,
and my biggest regret

03:31.254 --> 03:33.952
is letting my nose
get in the way

03:33.996 --> 03:36.999
of my dream of being
a telenovela star.

03:37.042 --> 03:40.307
I was raised
in San Luis Potosí, Mexico.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.134
When I was growing up,
I really wanted to be

03:42.178 --> 03:43.658
a soap opera actress.

03:43.701 --> 03:45.921
Telenovelas are very popular
in Mexico,

03:45.964 --> 03:48.010
and everybody loves telenovelas,

03:48.053 --> 03:49.881
and I would see
all the beautiful girls there

03:49.925 --> 03:55.626
in the stories--perfect hair,
perfect nose, perfect eyes.

03:55.670 --> 04:00.544
So all that is what, uh,
you learn and grow admiring.

04:00.588 --> 04:03.373
And I wanted to be famous
and be on TV,

04:03.417 --> 04:06.637
but I didn't have a nose
that was perfect.

04:06.681 --> 04:10.598
It was just a little bigger and
with a little bone over here.

04:10.641 --> 04:14.297
I remember the last doctor said
do not touch your nose.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.690
It's not that easy.

04:15.733 --> 04:20.390
This was
a very disgraceful experience.

04:20.434 --> 04:23.915
I was irresponsible.
Now it's different.

04:23.959 --> 04:27.397
After 5 surgeries
and 22 years with this nose,

04:27.441 --> 04:29.704
it creates so much regret.

04:29.747 --> 04:33.708
My nose looks chopped up
and looks flat, crooked,

04:33.751 --> 04:38.060
and also, now I just breathe
with my mouth.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.322
When I look at the mirror...

04:39.366 --> 04:41.019
it's just so much guilt

04:41.063 --> 04:44.284
because of me and for vanity.

04:44.327 --> 04:45.937
I need someone to help me.

04:45.981 --> 04:48.462
I need a miracle.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.119
I was FaceTiming Heather earlier.

04:54.163 --> 04:58.428
I was going whoa,
do I need Botox.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.038
But every once in a while,
you see someone

05:00.082 --> 05:01.562
who's had so much Botox...
- Yeah, yeah.

05:01.605 --> 05:02.563
- ...that their forehead...
- Yeah.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.129
- ...looks shiny.
- Yeah.

05:04.173 --> 05:07.785
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is an overdose of Botox.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.613
No. The difference with me, though,

05:09.657 --> 05:13.487
when I get a little smidgen
of Botox, I look good.

05:13.530 --> 05:16.403
You--You go crazy. You look like
a friggin' Martian.

05:16.446 --> 05:18.013
By the way,
when I had all that filler,

05:18.056 --> 05:21.930
it was so weird,
and it was everywhere online--

05:21.973 --> 05:24.846
"What happened
to Terry Dubrow's face?"

05:24.889 --> 05:26.369
Aren't you afraid that
you're gonna get

05:26.413 --> 05:29.154
so much Botox one day...
- 10 units.

05:29.198 --> 05:30.678
...that your anal sphincter
will be paralyzed

05:30.721 --> 05:32.767
and you won't be able
to control your bowels?

05:32.810 --> 05:36.684
I already have that problem.

05:36.727 --> 05:38.990
Paul--I learned my lesson,

05:39.034 --> 05:41.906
going light on the Botox
and much lighter on the fillers

05:41.950 --> 05:44.039
'cause I don't wanna look like
a freak.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.910
Apparently, you don't mind
that look.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.738
This is a WTF case.

05:47.782 --> 05:49.174
This is a woman named Shantel.

05:49.218 --> 05:52.003
Look at this disaster.
Huge bottoming out.

05:52.047 --> 05:53.788
They thought you could just
lower the crease

05:53.831 --> 05:56.138
all the way down here
and get away with it.

05:56.181 --> 05:58.096
It has no structure at all.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.534
It's just an amorphous blob
of nothing.

06:00.577 --> 06:04.842
Paul, she's had
one breast surgery.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.540
- This is a super hard case.
- Let's get her in.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.368
All right, Shantel.

06:08.411 --> 06:10.370
Can you please send in Shantel?

06:10.413 --> 06:13.982
- Shantel.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

06:14.025 --> 06:15.200
- Nice to meet you, Shantel.
- Nice to meet you.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.419
- Dr. Nassif.
- Hi, Shantel. Terry Dubrow.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.638
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Bryce.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.117
- Bryce, how are you?
- Bryce, Terry Dubrow.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.424
- Nice to meet you, man.
- Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

06:21.468 --> 06:22.512
Have a seat.
You just broke my hand.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.035
Yeah, me, too.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.733
I'm told that
every now and then.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.691
- Are you married?
- No, no.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.911
- Not yet, not yet.
- Boyfriend/girlfriend. Engaged.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.260
- Boyfriend/girlfriend.
- No.

06:31.303 --> 06:32.653
Working it out. Working it out.

06:32.696 --> 06:34.219
- Where's that ring?
- That's empty. What the heck?

06:34.263 --> 06:37.353
You're figuring it out.
So listen...there's, like,

06:37.397 --> 06:39.573
this far distance between
the bottom of your breasts

06:39.616 --> 06:41.923
to your belly button.
- Tell me about it, yep.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.533
<i>You</i> tell me about it.
How did that happen?

06:43.577 --> 06:45.143
So I was always, like, big,

06:45.187 --> 06:47.842
just growing up, just always
overweight, big girl.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.321
How much were you weighing then?

06:49.365 --> 06:51.062
- I was like 390.
- Whoa.

06:51.106 --> 06:54.414
And I hated my body, so I ended
up getting the duodenal switch.

06:54.457 --> 06:57.112
- You got a duodenal switch?
- Yeah.

06:57.155 --> 07:00.942
A duodenal switch gastric bypass
is probably the most aggressive

07:00.985 --> 07:06.034
and most complex type of
weight loss surgery procedure

07:06.077 --> 07:07.862
because it disconnects
the very first part

07:07.905 --> 07:10.821
of the digestive tract
after the stomach.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.693
It could have a lot
of complications

07:12.736 --> 07:14.042
associated with it.

07:14.085 --> 07:16.305
But it tends to be
very effective.

07:16.348 --> 07:20.004
So I lost, like, 200 pounds
in, like, in two years.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.876
- Whoa.
- Yeah, so I was, like,

07:21.919 --> 07:22.877
a melting lady.
- Yeah.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.835
- I had the bingo arms...
- Yeah.

07:24.879 --> 07:27.229
...and, like, the flabby tummy,
so it was bad.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.752
Did you have
some skin reducing surgery

07:28.796 --> 07:30.319
after all that weight loss?

07:30.362 --> 07:31.276
- I had a brachioplasty...
- Yeah.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.364
...if that's what it's called.

07:32.408 --> 07:34.628
It's from my elbow to, like,
my side.

07:34.671 --> 07:36.151
- Okay.
- And I had a tummy tuck.

07:36.194 --> 07:38.632
So then after that, I was like,
okay, I got the tummy

07:38.675 --> 07:41.025
and the arms, and it's like
the cherry on top.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.592
I just needed, you know,
the breasts.

07:42.636 --> 07:43.941
- Okay.
- I never had boobs, ever.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.204
So your natural breasts
were quite small.

07:46.248 --> 07:48.468
Tiny.
You know, I lived in San Diego,

07:48.511 --> 07:50.861
so what am I gonna do?
You know, go 30 minutes to T.J.

07:50.905 --> 07:53.211
- Tijuana.
- Which is terrible.

07:53.255 --> 07:54.517
They put you to sleep,
anesthesia and everything?

07:54.561 --> 07:55.779
- No. I was awake.
- Did it awake?

07:55.823 --> 07:57.825
- Oh, jeez.
- I laid on this table,

07:57.868 --> 08:00.088
and all of a sudden I'm feeling
like a poke in my back.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.350
An epidural.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.786
I swear I'd seen the light
a couple times,

08:02.830 --> 08:05.702
and then I say,
"Don't up,"

08:05.746 --> 08:07.835
and they all start laughing.

08:07.878 --> 08:10.185
Like, I wasn't joking. Like,
really, "Don't up."

08:10.228 --> 08:12.274
After surgery's over,
he stitches me up.

08:12.317 --> 08:15.538
He takes my limp hand
and put it on my boob,

08:15.582 --> 08:17.975
and he says, "I just changed
your life in under an hour."

08:18.019 --> 08:20.021
Fast forward, you're sitting
in front of us right now.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.370
Exactly, exactly.

08:21.413 --> 08:22.980
So how many ccs was put in?

08:23.024 --> 08:24.852
He said 800 ccs.

08:24.895 --> 08:26.984
I was kinda, like,
that sounded like a lot.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.160
I thought maybe 500, you know,

08:29.204 --> 08:32.120
once they healed, it was just...
this was it.

08:32.163 --> 08:34.209
Now I'm back
to being covered up.

08:34.252 --> 08:35.689
I want her to be comfortable
in her body.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.995
I want her to be--
feel comfortable to walk around.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.041
I should be proud of myself
for losing that much weight

08:40.084 --> 08:43.305
and transforming my body,
but instead,

08:43.348 --> 08:45.307
I'm just--I'm still ashamed.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.527
I hate what I see in the mirror
just like I did

08:47.570 --> 08:49.006
when I was almost 400 pounds.

08:49.050 --> 08:53.968
It's like I took five steps
forward and 10 steps back.

08:54.011 --> 08:56.013
I want 'em symmetrical, even,

08:56.057 --> 08:59.060
just higher,
and be able to get cleavage.

08:59.103 --> 09:01.889
The fundamental problem is
the doctor didn't realize that

09:01.932 --> 09:04.848
your breast tissue has a certain
connection between here

09:04.892 --> 09:06.110
and your chest wall.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.851
Well, if you just
blow through it,

09:07.895 --> 09:09.461
then what's holding it?
- Nothing.

09:09.505 --> 09:10.680
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.073
Just falls into the abdomen.

09:12.116 --> 09:14.466
You basically have belly boobs.

09:14.510 --> 09:17.818
Yeah, 100%.

09:17.861 --> 09:20.908
Chances that it will work
are low.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.258
I've had these where I had
to operate on people 12 times.

09:23.301 --> 09:25.347
Oh, my God.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.175
It's been about four months

09:27.218 --> 09:29.046
since my legs seem
to have been healed.

09:29.090 --> 09:32.093
Look what I did. Even
when they told me I couldn't.

09:32.136 --> 09:33.834
I still won. Ah.

09:35.183 --> 09:37.489
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

09:37.533 --> 09:39.535
Let me see what's going on.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.973
So you have
the classic bottoming out

09:43.017 --> 09:45.585
where the mound
is on your tummy.

09:45.628 --> 09:48.370
I mean, look at the distance
between the belly button

09:48.413 --> 09:50.067
and the bottom of the breast.

09:50.111 --> 09:52.374
It's what, 2 inches?

09:52.417 --> 09:53.984
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.507
I mean, your breast
is supposed to be up there.

09:55.551 --> 09:56.857
Yeah.

09:56.900 --> 10:00.425
Your original breasts
were basically like this.

10:00.469 --> 10:03.167
He should've put
a little implant in,

10:03.211 --> 10:05.648
just give you a little bit
of fullness here.

10:05.692 --> 10:06.954
Mm-hmm.

10:06.997 --> 10:11.088
Instead, he blew out
all of the attachments.

10:11.132 --> 10:15.702
You have all these
dense connections here

10:15.745 --> 10:18.661
between the crease
and the chest wall of your ribs.

10:18.705 --> 10:21.316
And it's just completely
been stretched out.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.709
All right, so sit down.

10:22.752 --> 10:26.538
The only way that we can
possibly fix this

10:26.582 --> 10:28.889
is to take the implants out,

10:28.932 --> 10:31.892
try to stitch everything down,
and try to sort of recreate

10:31.935 --> 10:35.547
some internal architecture,
and we have to go back in time.

10:35.591 --> 10:41.902
And if that's successful,
then we can go back maybe

10:41.945 --> 10:43.686
to the operating room

10:43.730 --> 10:46.471
and put some appropriately
sized and placed implants in.

10:46.515 --> 10:48.256
I just know--Listen, I've been
down his road before.

10:48.299 --> 10:51.476
I know I can go in there,
stitch everything up,

10:51.520 --> 10:53.348
put a smaller implant in.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.524
It might look great
on the table,

10:55.567 --> 10:57.265
and then six weeks later...

10:57.308 --> 10:58.832
- It falls back down.
- Falls back down.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.704
Yeah, because the tissue
integrity to hold that implant,

11:01.748 --> 11:03.097
especially even though
the weight

11:03.140 --> 11:05.186
doesn't seem that much,
but again,

11:05.229 --> 11:07.318
it's a downward force,
is gonna break.

11:07.362 --> 11:11.671
Chances that it will work...
are low.

11:11.714 --> 11:15.239
I have tried to fix
this type of situation

11:15.283 --> 11:19.504
in one stage before, and it's
really never worked very well.

11:19.548 --> 11:23.204
And Shantel's version is
much more dramatic.

11:23.247 --> 11:26.163
That's what makes this case
so difficult

11:26.207 --> 11:27.643
and gives me pause about whether

11:27.687 --> 11:29.732
I even want to attempt it
or not.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.908
Oh, man.

11:31.952 --> 11:34.215
I'm not instilling
much confidence, am I?

11:34.258 --> 11:35.869
No, you're scaring me.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.435
I'm getting nervous.
That's a lot for--

11:37.479 --> 11:38.610
- 2-part is what's--
- 2-part is--

11:38.654 --> 11:40.090
I thought we were doing
one part.

11:40.134 --> 11:44.007
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2-part? It might be 5-part.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.443
Might be seven parts.

11:45.487 --> 11:46.967
No, we don't want that.

11:47.010 --> 11:50.013
I've had these where I had
to operate on people 12 times.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.667
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.800
That's something I do not want.

11:53.843 --> 11:54.975
I don't want that either.

11:55.018 --> 11:57.542
Potential on having
multiple surgeries

11:57.586 --> 11:59.327
scares the crap out of me.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.503
But if all goes well
with my surgery,

12:01.546 --> 12:04.941
I really, of course, hope
to, you know, just be able

12:04.985 --> 12:07.901
to be happy with what I see
for once in my life.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.816
Do you wanna do this?

12:11.861 --> 12:13.602
I mean...yeah, I do.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.560
- You sure?
- I do, yeah.

12:15.604 --> 12:18.346
I can't imagine living
with these any longer.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.087
All right, let's do this thing.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.132
<i>♪ So turn it up</i>

12:22.176 --> 12:24.918
<i>♪ Yeah, we're gonna celebrate,</i> <i>

12:26.006 --> 12:27.181
<i>♪ Turn it up</i>

12:30.314 --> 12:32.882
Hi, guys, it's Justin Jedlica
here again,

12:32.926 --> 12:34.318
the amazing human doll,

12:34.362 --> 12:36.756
and as promised, I'm back
to show off to the doctors

12:36.799 --> 12:39.454
my 8-piece leg implant surgery.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.586
This is just like the last
virgin section of my body

12:41.630 --> 12:43.545
to give up, and now
it's all been touched.

12:43.588 --> 12:46.243
Oh, that didn't sound right.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.419
Last time that I talked
with Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif

12:48.463 --> 12:51.466
on our Zoom conversation,
I told them what I wanted to do.

12:51.509 --> 12:54.034
<i>So this piece will go over here,</i>

12:54.077 --> 12:56.645
<i>and then on the medialis piece,</i> <i>
it's gonna go here.</i>

12:56.688 --> 12:58.603
<i>Obviously will have calf plants</i>

12:58.647 --> 13:00.954
<i>made for the lower leg</i> <i>
here and here.</i>

13:00.997 --> 13:02.129
<i>So 8-piece implants,</i>

13:02.172 --> 13:04.609
<i>full leg augmentation</i> <i>
in one hit.</i>

13:04.653 --> 13:07.221
I don't think there's anybody
more cutting edge than me.

13:07.264 --> 13:09.614
I'm Frankenstein
and Dr. Frankenstein.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.878
Being a pioneer
with body implantation,

13:11.921 --> 13:13.183
risks and complications
are just something

13:13.227 --> 13:15.011
that come with that territory.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.926
I kind of get off on the fact

13:16.970 --> 13:18.536
that I'm doing things that
nobody else has done before,

13:18.580 --> 13:20.277
that other people
are scared to do.

13:20.321 --> 13:21.888
This is next level risk.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.412
Blood clots in the legs,
lymphatic flow,

13:24.455 --> 13:27.110
infection,
compartment syndrome.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.416
All those things
are on the table.

13:28.459 --> 13:31.723
If you catch 'em late...ouch.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.595
♪ Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah

13:33.638 --> 13:35.771
Look what I did.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.426
Even when they told me
I couldn't, I still won. Ahh.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.297
It's been about four months

13:40.341 --> 13:42.343
since my legs
seem to have been healed.

13:42.386 --> 13:43.735
I'm definitely on a high,

13:43.779 --> 13:45.607
and I just wanna show off
to the doctors.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.174
Checking in
with Dr. Nassif and Dubrow

13:47.217 --> 13:49.872
kinda feels like checking in
with your parents, you know?

13:49.916 --> 13:51.395
They tell you all the things
you're not supposed to do,

13:51.439 --> 13:53.354
and then you go do them anyway.

13:53.397 --> 13:56.357
But they don't have to love it,
but they have to love <i>you.</i>

14:01.449 --> 14:03.320
Claudia is coming to us.

14:03.364 --> 14:05.496
- Ooh.
- And there it is.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.281
Oh, my gosh.
Look at that collapse, too,

14:07.324 --> 14:08.630
the lack of projection.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.675
You know what's
the biggest limitation here?

14:10.719 --> 14:12.199
- The skin?
- Is the skin.

14:12.242 --> 14:13.853
- Yeah.
- You push that skin down,

14:13.896 --> 14:15.767
it could die right on
the table. So let's see her.

14:15.811 --> 14:16.856
Okay.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.596
Can you please send in Claudia?

14:18.640 --> 14:19.815
- Claudia.
- Hello.

14:19.859 --> 14:20.860
Claudia, nice to meet you.
Dr. Nassif.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.426
Nice to meet you, Doctor. Claudia.

14:22.470 --> 14:23.688
- How are you? Dr. Dubrow.
- Terry Dubrow.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.212
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

14:25.255 --> 14:26.169
- Friends?
- We're friends, yeah.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.562
- Yes.
- Yeah.

14:27.605 --> 14:28.737
- Great. Please have a seat.
- Childhood friends.

14:28.780 --> 14:29.869
- Thank you.
- What did you come in for?

14:29.912 --> 14:31.305
- Well, um--
- And where do you live?

14:31.348 --> 14:35.004
I've been living in Houston
for the last 22 years.

14:35.048 --> 14:38.007
If you have to pick one thing
you like about Houston,

14:38.051 --> 14:40.096
what would it be?
- The Houston Symphony.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.664
- The Symphony.
- Oh, you're into the arts.

14:42.707 --> 14:45.101
My family is a musician family.

14:45.145 --> 14:48.017
But I wanted to be an actress
like a soap opera actress.

14:48.061 --> 14:51.934
But then my parents just gave me
an option--piano or piano.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.414
- So I just stayed with piano.
- Piano or piano.

14:53.457 --> 14:55.024
Which did you choose?

14:55.068 --> 14:56.678
So what do you do now?
Do you play now or...

14:56.721 --> 14:57.897
- I teach piano.
- Oh, really?

14:57.940 --> 14:59.899
I teach. I have my piano studio, and...

14:59.942 --> 15:01.378
Do you ever take piano lessons?

15:01.422 --> 15:03.511
I took some. My mom started me
at the age of probably

15:03.554 --> 15:05.992
about 6 or 7.
- Oh.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.994
The biggest mistake I could've
made in my life was quitting.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.082
Yeah.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.910
I stopped getting
the piano lessons.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.433
So you became a pianist,
and you became a penis.

15:13.825 --> 15:16.045
In front of two women,
you had to say that?

15:16.089 --> 15:17.351
A penis?

15:17.394 --> 15:19.962
- I just couldn't help it.
- What a dick.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.269
In a nice,
professional consultation,

15:22.312 --> 15:24.401
I wouldn't expect anything less

15:24.445 --> 15:27.448
than a pianist/penis joke
from Terry,

15:27.491 --> 15:30.668
who's usually just being
a big dick anyway.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.279
Well, we're glad you're here
with us.

15:32.322 --> 15:35.891
We know you started a journey
of numerous rhinoplasties.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.719
Can you take us
through that journey?

15:37.762 --> 15:39.895
I always wanted to be
an actress,

15:39.939 --> 15:42.376
like a soap opera actress.
- So what happened?

15:42.419 --> 15:44.987
My nose was not like, uh, great.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.033
- What'd it look like?
- Uh, it looked like a...

15:47.076 --> 15:48.991
kind of like a--
like a little bone here.

15:49.035 --> 15:49.992
- You had a little hump?
- You had a hump?

15:50.036 --> 15:51.298
- Yeah, little hump, yeah.
- Okay.

15:51.341 --> 15:53.735
Around that time,
I did an audition

15:53.778 --> 15:57.913
in Televisa Center, which is
a big television company

15:57.957 --> 16:00.133
where the telenovelas are made
in Mexico.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.091
And I didn't make it.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.919
From there, I just start looking
at the mirror,

16:03.963 --> 16:06.356
and I'm like,
what's wrong with my nose?

16:06.400 --> 16:10.621
And I was too ashamed that
it was not perfect and pointy.

16:10.665 --> 16:14.930
By age 18, I had two surgery.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.801
- The same doctor.
- Same doctor.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.847
And he left
a very natural-looking nose.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.980
- Good.
- But not pointy,

16:21.023 --> 16:23.112
not anything that I wanted
like a...

16:23.156 --> 16:24.896
You mean like one
of the telenovelas?

16:24.940 --> 16:26.594
- Telenovelas, exactly.
- Actresses?

16:26.637 --> 16:27.943
So what did you do?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.771
I gave up for a while
and like, okay,

16:29.814 --> 16:31.642
I'm just gonna be
a flight attendant.

16:31.686 --> 16:34.428
And one day,
I was working first class,

16:34.471 --> 16:37.039
and Televisa owner was there.
- Ohh.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.780
And then I told him,
"You know what?

16:38.823 --> 16:40.825
I went to Televisa
eight years ago,

16:40.869 --> 16:43.828
and they didn't take me."
And he's like, "Okay.

16:43.872 --> 16:46.309
Just come see me,"
and I'm like, "Okay."

16:46.353 --> 16:48.529
This time I don't wanna
miss the opportunity.

16:48.572 --> 16:53.099
There was this doctor who was
like the popular at that moment.

16:53.142 --> 16:55.971
And I went with him. He said,
like, "Oh, I can totally

16:56.015 --> 16:58.713
make your nose perfect
to go to Televisa.

16:58.756 --> 17:01.759
I'm so glad you came.
Let's do it."

17:01.803 --> 17:05.067
- Mm.
- My nose looked smaller

17:05.111 --> 17:07.200
and a little fake.

17:07.243 --> 17:11.291
But it was okay. But the doctor
then said, "I don't like it."

17:11.334 --> 17:12.466
- Oh.
- "I didn't like it.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.903
I will do it perfect."

17:14.946 --> 17:19.429
I wish I'd never done
the third and fourth surgery.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.910
That was my big mistake.

17:21.953 --> 17:24.652
When I went back to take
the patch off...

17:24.695 --> 17:27.176
it looked horrible.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.527
I felt ashamed of my appearance,

17:30.571 --> 17:32.964
so I never went to see
Televisa's owner.

17:33.008 --> 17:36.316
My nose ruined
my telenovela dreams.

17:36.359 --> 17:40.798
I didn't know what to do,
so I just put a smaller patch,

17:40.842 --> 17:44.019
and a skin color to cover
all this mess...

17:44.063 --> 17:45.716
- Mm-hmm.
- ...for, like, two years.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.848
You were still wearing
the dressing on it.

17:46.891 --> 17:48.110
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Covering it...

17:48.154 --> 17:49.285
- Yeah.
- ...every single day.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.200
- Covered the nose up.
- For two years.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.767
- We never saw it.
- Yeah.

17:52.810 --> 17:55.161
She had it for a long time.

17:55.204 --> 17:57.337
She went to work with it,
and we said,

17:57.380 --> 18:01.080
"Take the patch off,"
but she was like, "No. Never."

18:01.123 --> 18:04.996
And then I called
the best doctor in the city.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.129
That doctor--
he did the best he could,

18:07.173 --> 18:10.176
but he said
the fourth surgery doctors

18:10.219 --> 18:14.441
killed the cartilage here,
and so it can just sink,

18:14.484 --> 18:16.051
and that's what happened.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.097
What would you like to have done
to your nose?

18:18.140 --> 18:21.056
I think it's too short
for my face,

18:21.100 --> 18:23.145
and the nose is too up.
- Mm-hmm.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.495
Like, uh, I would like it
to be lower.

18:25.539 --> 18:28.672
Lower. When we talk
about doing a sixth surgery,

18:28.716 --> 18:33.547
the unknown is the quality of
the skin and the blood supply.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.157
Because if we kill your skin,

18:35.201 --> 18:36.593
there's really no way
of going back.

18:36.637 --> 18:37.942
- Yeah.
- No matter what I do,

18:37.986 --> 18:40.554
it will never look
ever the same.

18:44.471 --> 18:45.863
- No way.
- Hey!

18:45.907 --> 18:46.821
- The man, the myth.
- No way.

18:46.864 --> 18:47.952
How you doing, boys?

18:47.996 --> 18:49.824
How many implants
do you have total?

18:49.867 --> 18:51.608
I think I have 25 implants now.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.262
Are you done, done?
You're done.

18:53.306 --> 18:54.568
Um...

18:54.611 --> 18:56.918
Look how far down
this pocket goes--

18:56.961 --> 18:58.746
all the way down to here.

18:58.789 --> 19:02.141
There, there, there.
This is the pocket.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.492
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

19:05.535 --> 19:08.364
Put your head back for us.

19:08.408 --> 19:12.847
So we see one cut here.

19:12.890 --> 19:14.501
I'm gonna put this in your nose.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.159
So the septum
is just going--

19:20.202 --> 19:23.510
it goes in, and then it shoots
all the way off to the left.

19:23.553 --> 19:28.732
All right, so your septum
is blocking your left airway.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.212
The good news--
that's pretty fixable.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.736
So the reconstruction
I've done before.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.217
We add cartilage
to the tip of your nose,

19:35.261 --> 19:37.393
lengthening it,
add projection.

19:37.437 --> 19:40.179
But the part that scares me--

19:40.222 --> 19:43.356
one--the little incision
you had here

19:43.399 --> 19:45.445
is in a very bad location,

19:45.488 --> 19:47.055
and once we actually
add length to it

19:47.098 --> 19:50.232
and try to put it back down
with that cut way at the bottom,

19:50.276 --> 19:53.148
that puts this whole area
right here

19:53.192 --> 19:55.542
at a compromised situation.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.674
The blood cannot get to it,

19:57.718 --> 20:00.416
and there's a high risk
of tissue death.

20:00.460 --> 20:04.115
Because if that happened,
we'd have to take tissue

20:04.159 --> 20:06.248
from up here and bring it down

20:06.292 --> 20:08.250
and rebuild the tip
of your nose.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.817
Oh, my goodness.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.950
That skin flap, since it's gonna
be long and thin, can die.

20:12.994 --> 20:17.433
I'd rather than my chance,
make a higher skin incision,

20:17.477 --> 20:19.740
which will have a shorter,
narrow flap,

20:19.783 --> 20:22.438
which means that will give us
a better blood supply.

20:22.482 --> 20:24.527
Well, it's really scary.

20:24.571 --> 20:28.444
I have prayed a lot
and leave it up to God.

20:28.488 --> 20:33.319
Take me as far as you want,
and I'm here.

20:33.362 --> 20:36.060
- I'm just gonna do it.
- Mm.

20:36.104 --> 20:37.627
Okay.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.150
Thank you.

20:39.194 --> 20:43.285
My nose reminds me that this was
something that I created,

20:43.329 --> 20:45.374
and so it makes me feel
very guilty.

20:45.418 --> 20:48.682
I'm hoping the surgery is
a chance for forgiveness.

20:48.725 --> 20:49.683
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Pleasure.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.119
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20:51.162 --> 20:52.294
- Thank you so much.
- Pleasure.

20:56.646 --> 20:59.780
- How are you?
- Good.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.651
So what are we gonna do?
So the plan is to try

21:01.695 --> 21:04.306
to re-establish
the inframammary crease.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.873
And how do we do that?

21:05.916 --> 21:08.310
Probably the most reliable way
is to stage her,

21:08.354 --> 21:10.225
and that still is high risk

21:10.269 --> 21:13.272
and has a relatively
low probability

21:13.315 --> 21:15.665
of being successful.

21:21.062 --> 21:23.847
<i>Today for phase one</i> <i>
of Shantel's surgery,</i>

21:23.891 --> 21:26.197
<i>I'll start by making incisions</i> <i>
below her areolas</i>

21:26.241 --> 21:28.591
<i>and remove her old implants.</i>

21:28.635 --> 21:31.986
<i>Next, I will close off Shantel's</i> <i>
previous breast pockets</i>

21:32.029 --> 21:34.336
<i>and create new pockets</i> <i>
by sewing her breast tissue</i>

21:34.380 --> 21:36.469
<i>to the back of her chest wall</i>

21:36.512 --> 21:39.733
<i>and recreating</i> <i>
her inframammary crease.</i>

21:39.776 --> 21:42.605
<i>Once she is healed, Shantel</i> <i>
will come back for phase two,</i>

21:42.649 --> 21:46.043
<i>where we will then be able</i> <i>
to insert new implants.</i>

21:48.568 --> 21:52.006
All right,
so here's the implant.

21:52.049 --> 21:56.053
So he just...
blew out the anatomy.

21:56.097 --> 22:00.884
He goes in and decides to make
a crease incision down here

22:00.928 --> 22:02.669
even though her crease
is up here

22:02.712 --> 22:06.760
and just create a giant pocket
and put an implant in

22:06.803 --> 22:08.849
with nothing holding it up,
and it just drops down to here.

22:08.892 --> 22:11.068
- Giant implant.
- And a giant implant.

22:11.112 --> 22:14.724
The biggest there--that's made.
All right, so...

22:14.768 --> 22:17.031
now let's look in the pocket.

22:17.074 --> 22:18.598
Huh.

22:18.641 --> 22:22.645
Wait a minute. It's got
its inframammary crease intact.

22:22.689 --> 22:26.083
He just went below the muscle,
so the muscle

22:26.127 --> 22:28.738
to inframammary crease
attachments are still in there.

22:28.782 --> 22:30.740
Good thing he went
in the wrong place.

22:30.784 --> 22:35.223
Yeah. What if I go
above the muscle

22:35.266 --> 22:38.052
and create a pocket
that now has all

22:38.095 --> 22:40.489
of the usual anatomical borders?

22:40.533 --> 22:42.796
But it's on top of the muscle.

22:42.839 --> 22:46.408
The inframammary crease
is composed of multiple layers

22:46.452 --> 22:49.585
of distinct tissue,
all very different.

22:49.629 --> 22:52.632
In Shantel's case,
the lower portion

22:52.675 --> 22:54.938
of the inframammary crease
has been disrupted,

22:54.982 --> 22:58.942
but the areas above the muscle
are still intact and tight.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.510
So the possibility exists that
if I can make a pocket

23:01.554 --> 23:06.646
above the muscle that depends
on the old inframammary crease,

23:06.689 --> 23:10.606
and I can somehow get the muscle
to stick down,

23:10.650 --> 23:13.479
then I've got
an on-top-of-the-muscle

23:13.522 --> 23:16.264
breast implant pocket
that may work.

23:16.307 --> 23:22.139
We take
pectoralis minor below...

23:22.183 --> 23:25.099
to the pectoralis major above.

23:25.142 --> 23:29.669
It may, in fact, be possible
to attempt the unthinkable,

23:29.712 --> 23:32.323
which is to put in implants
and test to see

23:32.367 --> 23:37.111
whether we can actually do this
in one stage today.

23:37.154 --> 23:40.462
- What do you have?
- I have 590, 615, 650.

23:40.506 --> 23:43.291
615. Doesn't it feel--
615 feel like...

23:43.334 --> 23:45.206
It feels like the right number.

23:45.249 --> 23:46.555
Doesn't it?

23:46.599 --> 23:50.124
The big question is
will that normal anatomy

23:50.167 --> 23:53.867
hold a smaller implant than she
had placed in Tijuana?

23:53.910 --> 23:55.695
Okay.

23:55.738 --> 23:59.829
Look at that inframammary crease
is totally perfect.

23:59.873 --> 24:02.353
Okay, let's do the other side.

24:02.397 --> 24:04.878
The implant.

24:04.921 --> 24:08.316
Look how far down
this pocket goes,

24:08.359 --> 24:10.666
all the way down to here.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.669
There, there, there.
This is the pocket.

24:13.713 --> 24:17.456
So her previous surgeon
was a dumbass.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.806
Yeah, that's
her old inframammary creases.

24:19.849 --> 24:23.026
Pleasantly surprised that
Shantel's inframammary crease

24:23.070 --> 24:26.726
is intact above the muscle
also on the left side.

24:26.769 --> 24:30.033
So she will hopefully have
good-looking matching breasts,

24:30.077 --> 24:32.253
and she won't need any surgery anymore.

24:32.296 --> 24:34.342
Goddamnit, this is working.

24:34.385 --> 24:37.519
I think we invented something
today, ladies and gentlemen.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.521
- That's pretty good.
- I know.

24:39.565 --> 24:42.176
Can someone pat me on the back?
Come on.

24:42.219 --> 24:43.351
Later.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.527
Yeah. We're closing.

24:45.571 --> 24:49.705
I really need to see that
Shantel is healing okay,

24:49.749 --> 24:52.708
and, uh, at this point,
I'm just hoping for the best.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.884
Oh, my God.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.625
That's going in the septum
right there.

24:56.669 --> 25:00.499
Multiple surgeries went to town
on Claudia's septum.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.718
Why? You don't do something
like that.

25:02.762 --> 25:04.720
Okay, this is a hard one.

25:06.069 --> 25:08.376
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

25:08.419 --> 25:11.684
Hello, young lady. How are you?

25:11.727 --> 25:13.294
So how do you feel?

25:13.337 --> 25:16.340
- Sore. Sore, sore, sore.
- I bet.

25:16.384 --> 25:19.387
So the inframammary crease
is an attachment

25:19.430 --> 25:23.347
that goes from the skin
through the breast tissue,

25:23.391 --> 25:26.525
through the muscle
to the chest wall.

25:26.568 --> 25:31.225
Because he put everything
on the muscle entirely,

25:31.268 --> 25:33.923
the connections between...
- Were still intact.

25:33.967 --> 25:35.359
...the breast...

25:35.403 --> 25:36.709
...and inframammary crease
are still there.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.406
- Uh-huh.
- So it was intact.

25:38.449 --> 25:41.975
So I thought, wait a minute.
It's still intact.

25:42.018 --> 25:43.716
I can use it.

25:43.759 --> 25:45.065

25:45.108 --> 25:46.196
So, yeah, there's implants
in there.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.547

25:48.590 --> 25:52.028

26:05.781 --> 26:07.217
That's a crease.

26:07.261 --> 26:08.915
- I'm nervous.
- You wanna look?

26:08.958 --> 26:11.091

to show off at the gym

27:59.895 --> 28:01.723
if it were made of real muscle.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.203
Do you go to the gym
just so you can

28:03.246 --> 28:04.900
walk around and, like, work out?

28:04.944 --> 28:06.423
- No.
- You still--no gym?

28:06.467 --> 28:08.208
I haven't been to the gym
in, like, 12 years.

28:08.251 --> 28:09.557
So...

28:09.600 --> 28:12.952
Remind us. You were gonna
do medial quad implants.

28:12.995 --> 28:15.041
- Mm-hmm.
- Calf implants.

28:15.084 --> 28:16.346
- Mm-hmm.
- Tell us about it.

28:16.390 --> 28:17.696
I flew all the way
to Indianapolis.

28:17.739 --> 28:18.914
- It was a lot.
- How long did the surgery take?

28:18.958 --> 28:20.133
Five and a half hours.

28:20.176 --> 28:22.309
So did you fly in
with the implants,

28:22.352 --> 28:24.441
or he had them?
- We made them together.

28:24.485 --> 28:25.704
We met in the middle somewhere

28:25.747 --> 28:27.227
in sort of what I wanted
and what he liked.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.316
After the initial two weeks,

28:29.359 --> 28:32.058
my left leg--I said,
I just think this pocket's

28:32.101 --> 28:33.146
kinda, like, too tight,

28:33.189 --> 28:34.974
and the implant's
not sitting flat.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.584
So he said, "Okay, well,
I'm gonna cut you down here.

28:36.627 --> 28:38.499
We'll throw you in the O.R.,
and they'll stick that rod,"

28:38.542 --> 28:40.109
and he's like,
"I'll just flip it."

28:40.153 --> 28:41.545
The pocket was too narrow.

28:41.589 --> 28:43.112
So... So I did that

28:43.156 --> 28:44.766
just under local.

28:44.810 --> 28:48.596
But this medialis piece kinda
started giving me an issue

28:48.639 --> 28:49.771
after those two weeks.
- Like what?

28:49.815 --> 28:52.774
- Just pooling fluid.
- Little seroma.

28:52.818 --> 28:53.906
- Yes.
- Okay.

28:53.949 --> 28:56.082
- So we threw a drain in it.
- Right.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.866
But that didn't work.

28:57.910 --> 28:59.912
I said, what about that human
fibrin glue that they have?

28:59.955 --> 29:01.217
Mm-hmm.

29:01.261 --> 29:03.916
It might act as the capsule
and seal

29:03.959 --> 29:04.917
wherever it's not wanting
to heal.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.788
Okay.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.094
- And everything fine.
- What, did it work?

29:08.137 --> 29:09.617
- Yes!
- You're kidding me.

29:09.660 --> 29:10.836
I use fibrin glue every week...

29:10.879 --> 29:12.272
- Mm-hmm.
- ...in surgery.

29:12.315 --> 29:14.883
I'll use that to prevent
bleeding, but not a seroma.

29:14.927 --> 29:17.799
In general, fibrin glue
is a clotting mechanism,

29:17.843 --> 29:20.193
and you would put a little bit,
for example,

29:20.236 --> 29:21.890
I'm doing a face-lift.

29:21.934 --> 29:23.805
I lift up the skin, do my work,
apply some of the fibrin glue,

29:23.849 --> 29:27.287
stick it back down,
and it creates a nice bond

29:27.330 --> 29:29.463
between the skin
and the deeper tissue.

29:29.506 --> 29:31.813
Seems like a novel idea
to prevent seromas,

29:31.857 --> 29:33.467
which are a collection
of fluid in the body

29:33.510 --> 29:36.383
around the implants.
Very cool.

29:36.426 --> 29:38.167
How many implants
do you have, total?

29:38.211 --> 29:39.778
I think I have 25 implants now.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.997
- One in your nose.
- The bridge.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.129
And then up here. You have...

29:43.172 --> 29:43.999
- Anterior.
- Yes.

29:44.043 --> 29:45.261
- Posterior.
- Okay.

29:45.305 --> 29:46.132
Lateral delt.

29:46.175 --> 29:47.568
- Seven.
- Seven.

29:47.611 --> 29:48.569
Okay.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.789
- Biceps.
- I have bicep and tricep.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.399
- Okay.
- 11.

29:52.442 --> 29:53.313
Teres minor major
as a single piece.

29:53.356 --> 29:55.402
- 13.
- 2 in the quad

29:55.445 --> 29:56.969
and then 2 down below.
- That's 21.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.753
Wait a minute. Six...

29:58.797 --> 30:00.146
- Chest.
- Oh, I forgot my chest.

30:00.189 --> 30:01.756
Yeah, pecs.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.453
I totally forgot
that I had done that.

30:03.497 --> 30:04.324
My back implants came out.

30:04.367 --> 30:06.848
So you had 25, down to 23.

30:06.892 --> 30:07.980
Are you done, done?
You're done.

30:08.023 --> 30:10.243
Um...

30:10.286 --> 30:11.505
I think
after this leg procedure,

30:11.548 --> 30:12.898
I might take about a year
to myself

30:12.941 --> 30:16.118
before I decide to embark
on another big journey.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.598
But believe you me, it'll come.

30:17.641 --> 30:21.167
Let's get right to the...meat--
heart of the matter.

30:21.210 --> 30:23.169
Let's get back to the penis.

30:23.212 --> 30:24.692
Did it increase in size?

30:24.735 --> 30:27.695
Listen, I mean, its girth,
for sure,

30:27.738 --> 30:29.392
but to get length,
it's super hard.

30:29.436 --> 30:31.438
I mean, the only thing,
I have, like, a stretcher.

30:31.481 --> 30:32.700
Imagine, like a choker, right,

30:32.743 --> 30:33.919
which goes around
above your knee

30:33.962 --> 30:35.659
just below where my implant
is now.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.009
- Right.
- There's like a bungee cord...

30:37.052 --> 30:39.620
- That pulls on it?
- That goes and you attach it

30:39.663 --> 30:41.187
to the bottom of your penis,
and it pulls.

30:41.230 --> 30:42.710
Ow. Really?

30:42.753 --> 30:44.886
So you're supposed to wear that
for a period of time

30:44.930 --> 30:46.714
until it starts to hurt.
- God!

30:46.757 --> 30:47.889
In my opinion, you're stretching
the ligament.

30:49.630 --> 30:51.980
I know what I'm getting Paul
for his birthday this year.

30:54.678 --> 30:56.115
- So, listen...
- Mm-hmm.

30:56.158 --> 31:00.902
Two things. One, I'm so happy
that even though you--

31:00.946 --> 31:02.948
we didn't want you to do
the procedure, you did it,

31:02.991 --> 31:04.340
and really only had
minor complications,

31:04.384 --> 31:06.647
but two--you must show us.
You must.

31:06.690 --> 31:09.476
- Okay.
- Let's do this. Come on.

31:09.519 --> 31:10.781
Let's do this.

31:10.825 --> 31:13.567
So you have two.
You have one here

31:13.610 --> 31:16.700
and one there.
- There. That's the glute one.

31:16.744 --> 31:19.138
- Don't bust her open.
- Oh, yeah.

31:19.181 --> 31:21.009
My gauze is already soaked.

31:21.053 --> 31:22.576
I need to stop the bleeding immediately.

31:22.619 --> 31:25.318
I might have to stop
the surgery altogether.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.276
Jeez Louise.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.932
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

31:30.976 --> 31:33.935
Before we get to the reason
you're here,

31:33.979 --> 31:35.719
remind us what all
this good stuff looks like.

31:35.763 --> 31:37.852
All right.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.942
- Got these. Amazing.
- Mm.

31:40.986 --> 31:43.075
Then there's this situation.

31:43.118 --> 31:45.860
- It so weirdly worked.
- Right? It came out good.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.209
That's 'cause I designed it all.
You know that.

31:47.253 --> 31:48.341
Yeah, pretty brilliant, my man.
Look at this.

31:48.384 --> 31:50.343
You can't find these pieces anywhere.

31:50.386 --> 31:52.171
- What is this?
- They're all my crazy creation.

31:52.214 --> 31:55.304
Not one malposition, not one
that's moving around funny.

31:55.348 --> 31:57.045
- Nothing?
- No.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.526
It's not my cup of tea,
making all these implants,

31:59.569 --> 32:00.962
but he's a pretty smart guy

32:01.006 --> 32:03.008
and he really knows
what he's doing.

32:03.051 --> 32:06.533
However, as he ages, how are
those implants gonna look?

32:06.576 --> 32:08.187
Are they gonna get infected?

32:08.230 --> 32:10.406
Are they gonna start to sag?
Are they gonna move positions?

32:10.450 --> 32:15.934
I just don't see Justin having
these implants at the age of 65.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.196
Let's get to the meat of things.

32:17.239 --> 32:18.501
All right, let's get
to the meat. Let's see.

32:18.545 --> 32:19.938
All right, here it comes.
Ready? Well, hello!

32:22.027 --> 32:24.507
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

32:24.551 --> 32:26.640
What is that thing there?
Is that full of silicone?

32:26.683 --> 32:28.250
- My quads?
- No, no, your penis.

32:28.294 --> 32:29.730
That's like about
a huge baseball in there.

32:29.773 --> 32:31.253
You guys have just never seen
the lower half of me,

32:31.297 --> 32:32.602
so you wouldn't know.
- Wait a minute.

32:32.646 --> 32:34.561
It's hard not to get distracted
by that bulge.

32:34.604 --> 32:39.740
It's like the 800-pound...
gorilla penis in the room.

32:39.783 --> 32:41.524
- Okay. Show us the legs.
- So...

32:41.568 --> 32:43.396
Where was the incision made
for this one?

32:43.439 --> 32:46.138
- All the way up here.
- Wow.

32:46.181 --> 32:49.576
So you had two.
You had one here and one there.

32:49.619 --> 32:51.839
That's the glute one.
Don't bust her open.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.972
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, really?

32:54.015 --> 32:55.408
No, 'cause remember
we don't want--

32:55.451 --> 32:56.844
remember we don't want any--
That's the glute one.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.019
Where's the incision
for this one?

32:58.063 --> 32:59.107
Those calves were tight.

32:59.151 --> 33:02.328
Stand flat. Stand up.

33:02.371 --> 33:03.938
Dude. Speechless.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.287
Thank you.

33:05.331 --> 33:07.202
- Wow.
- That's what I was going for.

33:07.246 --> 33:09.552
It definitely makes me feel
proud to have the doctors

33:09.596 --> 33:11.293
look at my surgery
and give me the accolades

33:11.337 --> 33:14.383
that I've been searching for.
Yeah, it feels good.

33:14.427 --> 33:15.471
You know, I must say,
you look amazing.

33:15.515 --> 33:16.907
You really do.
I'm so glad you...

33:16.951 --> 33:18.648
Well, you know,
it's important for me

33:18.692 --> 33:19.998
to be, like, an innovator.
- ...didn't have a problem.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.303
- I would call it.
- By the way, yeah,

33:21.347 --> 33:23.479
if you look up
"plastic surgery innovator"

33:23.523 --> 33:25.873
in the encyclopedia, you're--
you're standing out.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.396
I wonder what would happen

33:27.440 --> 33:29.398
if you actually had a package
that big

33:29.442 --> 33:30.486
and you went home to Heather
with that.

33:30.530 --> 33:32.662
- Uh...
- What would she say to you?

33:32.706 --> 33:34.316
Heather would say,
"Let's renew our vows."

33:42.281 --> 33:44.326
- Good morning.
- Good morning. How are you?

33:44.370 --> 33:48.200
I'm good. Thank you.
My name is Claudia Cossio.

33:48.243 --> 33:50.158
I know it's my sixth surgery,

33:50.202 --> 33:54.989
and I had a lot of fear,
guilt, regret,

33:55.033 --> 33:57.905
but having surgery today
with Dr. Nassif,

33:57.948 --> 34:00.299
it means a miracle
I asked for.

34:00.342 --> 34:02.736
- Good morning.
- Hi!

34:02.779 --> 34:04.651
- How are you?
- I'm nervous.

34:04.694 --> 34:09.395
It's okay. I mean,
it's your sixth surgery.

34:09.438 --> 34:12.876
You're worried about that skin
right there surviving.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.314
But again, that's something that
we do.

34:15.357 --> 34:17.055
We deal with this all the time.

34:17.098 --> 34:20.362
And we will take great care
of you.

34:20.406 --> 34:22.799
- We'll see you in there, okay?
- Okay. Thank you.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.372
<i>
For Claudia's surgery today,</i>

34:30.416 --> 34:33.375
<i>I'll open the nose by making</i> <i>
an incision higher than normal</i>

34:33.419 --> 34:36.378
<i>on the columella,</i> <i>
while Dr. Peng harvests rib.</i>

34:36.422 --> 34:39.729
<i>Next, I'll perform a septoplasty</i> <i>
to help straighten her nose</i>

34:39.773 --> 34:41.383
<i>and improve her breathing</i>

34:41.427 --> 34:42.993
<i>and use</i> <i>
the septal extension graft</i>

34:43.037 --> 34:45.735
<i>and spreader grafts to add
length and support to her nose.</i>

34:45.779 --> 34:48.216
<i>Finally, I'll use</i> <i>
articulating rim grafts</i>

34:48.260 --> 34:49.870
<i>to make her nose symmetric</i>

34:49.913 --> 34:53.221
<i>and an infratip lobule graft</i> <i>
to give her tip projection.</i>

34:53.265 --> 34:56.137
Giving her a 4x4 on that start.

34:56.181 --> 35:00.576
So I'm making the incision
more of a higher location

35:00.620 --> 35:04.232
than her previous one.

35:04.276 --> 35:05.407
Ooh, look at that.
Oh, it's bleeding. Wow.

35:05.451 --> 35:08.410
You've got a little blood vessel
in there.

35:08.454 --> 35:11.239
All right, can I have
another 4x4? Yeah.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.545
Wow.

35:12.588 --> 35:16.897
So you've got...
that gauze is already soaked.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.072
Whew.

35:18.116 --> 35:21.031
Okay.

35:21.075 --> 35:24.122
Suction right there.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.427
Jeez Louise.

35:25.471 --> 35:26.994
I need to stop the bleeding immediately.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.604
I can't see what I'm doing.

35:28.648 --> 35:31.868
So we're gonna give Claudia
an IV infusion of TXA,

35:31.912 --> 35:33.348
tranexamic acid.

35:33.392 --> 35:38.266
That should slow down
the bleeding in most situations.

35:38.310 --> 35:39.615
But if that doesn't work,

35:39.659 --> 35:42.488
I might have to stop
the surgery altogether.

35:42.531 --> 35:44.272
All right,
the rib is coming out.

35:44.316 --> 35:46.796
The good news is the bleeding
has slowed down.

35:46.840 --> 35:50.931
Okay, our next adventure
is to find the septum.

35:50.974 --> 35:52.933
There it is.

35:52.976 --> 35:55.892
That might be the front
of the septum right there.

35:55.936 --> 35:58.199
Okay, this is a hard one.

35:58.243 --> 36:02.247
Either one surgery
or multiple surgeries

36:02.290 --> 36:04.466
went to town
on Claudia's septum.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.729
Why? You don't do
something like that.

36:06.773 --> 36:09.993
When you take too much septum
away from the nose,

36:10.037 --> 36:11.778
automatically, you're gonna get

36:11.821 --> 36:13.997
an over-rotated
piggy type of a nose.

36:14.041 --> 36:15.695
Part two of this now is gonna

36:15.738 --> 36:19.351
start re-establishing
her length.

36:19.394 --> 36:22.571
We've already placed
the septal extension graft--

36:22.615 --> 36:25.400
actually two of them--
to reconstruct part

36:25.444 --> 36:28.490
of the lower septum
that was already missing.

36:28.534 --> 36:33.321
All right, our next step
can be these spreader grafts

36:33.365 --> 36:36.716
as long as possible.

36:36.759 --> 36:39.588
Down.

36:39.632 --> 36:44.027
All right, so now we're doing
the infratip lobule graft.

36:44.071 --> 36:46.639
Let's see. Is that gonna stick?

36:46.682 --> 36:49.207
Mm-hmm.
It's already stuck. Look.

36:49.250 --> 36:52.993
An infratip lobule graft
is a piece of cartilage

36:53.036 --> 36:54.864
or diced cartilage
glued together

36:54.908 --> 36:58.694
that's placed on what we call
the infratip,

36:58.738 --> 37:01.915
which is right here,
which will give the tip length,

37:01.958 --> 37:05.310
a little bit more projection,
and make it look soft and nice.

37:05.353 --> 37:06.441
- You got it.
- Yay.

37:06.485 --> 37:07.486
Nice.

37:07.529 --> 37:09.096
Skin tone is perfect right now.

37:09.139 --> 37:10.924
The only other area
we have to watch out

37:10.967 --> 37:14.754
is between the incision
and the old lower incision.

37:14.797 --> 37:18.540
I think we nailed it.
Thank you all.

37:23.153 --> 37:25.373
Let me just put on
my little headlight.

37:25.417 --> 37:27.810
Put your head back for me.
There you go. Great.

37:27.854 --> 37:29.334
Fantastic.

37:29.377 --> 37:31.727
All right, well, here's
the first part of good news.

37:31.771 --> 37:34.730
Remember I was worried about
the little incision here?

37:34.774 --> 37:36.732
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I made a higher cut?

37:36.776 --> 37:42.042
I was worried that that skin
between your old incision

37:42.085 --> 37:43.391
and the new incision would die.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.959
- It's really pink. It's great.
- Okay.

37:46.002 --> 37:47.569
So that's good.

37:47.613 --> 37:49.658
I'm very happy
that my skin is responding

37:49.702 --> 37:51.312
to the surgery.

37:51.356 --> 37:52.313
It's a miracle.

37:52.357 --> 37:56.622
I'm so happy...

37:56.665 --> 37:59.581
I was very happy
with the length,

37:59.625 --> 38:04.020
the projection, this,
and the symmetry from the front.

38:04.064 --> 38:07.241
- About a good 80% better.
- Oh, 80%?

38:07.285 --> 38:09.939
I'm very relieved
and very happy, very grateful.

38:09.983 --> 38:12.072
I just can't wait to see.

38:12.115 --> 38:13.595
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

38:13.639 --> 38:16.250
Yeah, thank you, doctor.
Bye-bye. Thank you.

38:18.383 --> 38:19.819
I feel like
a totally new person.

38:19.862 --> 38:22.996
I feel like a weight has been
lifted off my shoulders.

38:23.039 --> 38:24.040
You're looking good.

38:24.084 --> 38:26.260
So many surgeries ruined
my nose.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.567
Now I have a second chance.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.133
- Claudia.
- How are you, Doctor?

38:30.177 --> 38:31.657
- How are you? Please, come in.
- How are you, Dr. Nassif?

38:32.962 --> 38:35.356
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

38:41.841 --> 38:44.757
I never thought I'd be this far
with my body.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.281
I used to live my life feeling abnormal.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.892
You know, I was always
the tallest and the biggest,

38:49.936 --> 38:52.634
and then I drop all this weight
and have the saggy skin,

38:52.678 --> 38:54.375
and then I get it taken care of,

38:54.419 --> 38:57.291
and then having a nightmare
boob job in Tijuana--

38:57.335 --> 38:59.598
everything was just always
so abnormal.

38:59.641 --> 39:03.950
<i>♪ Oh, I'm on fire</i>

39:03.993 --> 39:06.866
- Hi. I got you a towel, baby.
- Yay.

39:06.909 --> 39:08.868
I feel like
a totally new person.

39:08.911 --> 39:11.479
I feel like a weight has been
lifted off my shoulders--

39:11.523 --> 39:13.525
two boulders.

39:13.568 --> 39:15.788
Mommy, I like your bathing suit.

39:15.831 --> 39:17.529
- We're matching.
- You're looking good.

39:17.572 --> 39:18.704
I'm glad you feel comfortable,
though. That's what's important.

39:18.747 --> 39:19.966
Finally.

39:20.009 --> 39:22.447
Before my surgery,
I had triple T's--

39:22.490 --> 39:24.318
terrible Tijuana titties.

39:24.362 --> 39:29.323
They were huge, asymmetrical,
and hanging down so low,

39:29.367 --> 39:31.020
they almost touched
my belly button.

39:31.064 --> 39:32.370
But now thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

39:32.413 --> 39:35.460
I have matching breasts
that are perky

39:35.503 --> 39:38.027
and the right size and shape.

39:38.071 --> 39:40.726
I can enjoy quality time
with the people I love,

39:40.769 --> 39:45.208
and my triple T's are now
tight, terrific titties.

39:45.252 --> 39:46.427
I know you've been looking a lot
better. You're feeling better.

39:46.471 --> 39:48.734
I feel good.
I feel like I healed quick.

39:48.777 --> 39:50.605
He did a great job.

39:50.649 --> 39:53.129
You look so much happier now
that you got your boobs done.

39:53.173 --> 39:54.609
You're not moping
around the house no more.

39:54.653 --> 39:57.482
I'm so glad Dr. Dubrow was able
to do it one time.

39:57.525 --> 40:00.049
God, I know. I couldn't imagine
having more than one surgery.

40:00.093 --> 40:01.355
Yeah, can you imagine
going back like, for, like,

40:01.399 --> 40:02.661
the fifth one next week?

40:02.704 --> 40:04.445
No, I couldn't,
especially with her,

40:04.489 --> 40:06.012
Like, are you kidding me?

40:06.055 --> 40:07.317
I'm showing off
my new trophy girl everywhere.

40:07.361 --> 40:11.104
We going to the store.
We're going to the mall.

40:11.147 --> 40:13.715
We're going to the bank.
We're going to the laundromat.

40:13.759 --> 40:15.413
She's looking good everywhere.

40:15.456 --> 40:16.588
Look at her go.

40:16.631 --> 40:18.328
You're definitely
my new favorite thing.

40:18.372 --> 40:20.026
Are they? You don't even look
at my face anymore.

40:20.069 --> 40:21.462
They're just so amazing
to look at.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.464
- They just move everywhere.
- Whatever.

40:23.508 --> 40:24.813
When we're having sex, it just--

40:24.857 --> 40:25.771
- Shh!
- Just amazing.

40:25.814 --> 40:27.207
Baby.

40:27.250 --> 40:29.470
This is definitely
the first time in my life

40:29.514 --> 40:31.341
that I haven't felt ashamed
with my body.

40:31.385 --> 40:32.734
I look in the mirror,
and I'm happy,

40:32.778 --> 40:35.433
and that's something
I've never had before, so...

40:35.476 --> 40:39.306
I'm definitely
thankful and happy for sure.

40:42.875 --> 40:44.833
Yeah, Mommy and Daddy
need a nap.

40:44.877 --> 40:46.792
- Is it nap time?
- It's nap time, Mommy.

40:46.835 --> 40:49.229
It's Mommy and Daddy time.
You gots to go.

40:54.452 --> 40:57.672
Looking back in the darkest
moments of my life,

40:57.716 --> 41:01.850
going through so many surgeries,
really ruining my nose,

41:01.894 --> 41:05.419
now I just feel like I have
a second chance.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.639
<i>♪ It's gonna be great,</i> <i>

41:07.682 --> 41:10.598
<i>♪ You're gonna be all right</i>

41:10.642 --> 41:14.341
I think any telenovela star
would love my nose.

41:14.384 --> 41:16.604
- Claudia.
- How are you, Doctor?

41:16.648 --> 41:18.780
- How are you? Please, come in.
- How are you, Dr. Nassif?

41:18.824 --> 41:19.999
This is Claudia.
That's Paulina.

41:20.042 --> 41:23.306
Hi, Paulina!
Oh, my goodness.

41:23.350 --> 41:24.656
Look at her.
Isn't she beautiful?

41:24.699 --> 41:27.615
- Nice to meet you.
- She is a piano instructor.

41:27.659 --> 41:28.964
- As you know.
- Oh, nice.

41:29.008 --> 41:30.444
And she's my patient.
She's seven weeks out

41:30.488 --> 41:31.663
from a reconstruction rhinoplasty.

41:31.706 --> 41:33.882
- Oh, that looks amazing.
- I did number...

41:33.926 --> 41:35.275
Six and last one.

41:35.318 --> 41:38.104
Before my surgery
with Dr. Nassif,

41:38.147 --> 41:43.413
my nose looked pushed up,
my columella was disappearing,

41:43.457 --> 41:45.328
and I felt ashamed
of my appearance.

41:45.372 --> 41:48.070
Now since my surgery
with Dr. Nassif,

41:48.114 --> 41:50.812
my nose has been lengthened.

41:50.856 --> 41:53.685
My columella looks
completely normal,

41:53.728 --> 41:57.036
and I can let go of the guilt
and move on with my life.

41:57.079 --> 41:59.604
So she's here to give me
a little piano lesson.

41:59.647 --> 42:01.257
- Yay!
- Now again,

42:01.301 --> 42:03.042
I don't know how to play.
I forgot everything.

42:03.085 --> 42:05.044
It's been 42, 43 years.

42:05.087 --> 42:06.611
If he can do this...

42:06.654 --> 42:07.960
Ahh...

42:08.003 --> 42:12.660
He can play Beethoven
"Piano Concerto Number 5"

42:12.704 --> 42:14.706
in...three years.

42:19.362 --> 42:21.016
One, two.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.365
I have to put her down
for a nap.

42:22.409 --> 42:24.454
- No!
- Yeah, she's getting fussy.

42:24.498 --> 42:26.848
She can't sleep with all
the sounds of music.

42:26.892 --> 42:28.371
You're gonna put her down
for a nap?

42:28.415 --> 42:30.983
- Yeah.
- Okay. Well, maybe...

42:31.026 --> 42:33.812
can you play her
a little lullaby?

42:33.855 --> 42:35.378
Sure.

42:35.422 --> 42:38.686
I just feel so grateful for
all that's happening to me.

42:38.730 --> 42:43.996
I'm just very grateful to God
to send me to Dr. Nassif.

43:01.535 --> 43:03.102
Say, "Good night, Daddy."

43:03.145 --> 43:05.626
I have a scar on my stomach

43:05.670 --> 43:07.759
that I can fit my whole hand in.

43:07.802 --> 43:09.804
I touched her. She was ice cold.

43:09.848 --> 43:12.459
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be here.

43:12.502 --> 43:13.895
You were close.

43:13.939 --> 43:16.289
I have to be very careful
how I sit because

43:16.332 --> 43:19.205
I just got turned on
very easily.

43:19.248 --> 43:20.467
Wow.

43:20.510 --> 43:23.209
A colleague offered to do
filler for me,

43:23.252 --> 43:24.863
and it was silicone.
- Ooh.

43:24.906 --> 43:26.081
All of a sudden,
it just went boom,

43:26.125 --> 43:27.430
and then there was
this huge granulomas.

43:27.474 --> 43:28.693
Yeah.

43:28.736 --> 43:29.694
Is that fungus or what is that?

43:29.737 --> 43:30.999
It actually looks like cotton.

43:31.043 --> 43:33.175
Thank God I found that gauze.
