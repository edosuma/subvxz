WEBVTT

01:00.769 --> 01:03.313
<i>Hi there. I'm out delivering smiles.</i>

01:17.411 --> 01:19.371
So, how's the family, Bill?

01:19.371 --> 01:22.875
The lousy brats
and the human buzz saw? Kidding.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.334
Yeah, right.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.503
What's it all for, right?
All the hard work.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.672
It sure as hell is not for me.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.340
All right,

01:30.340 --> 01:34.052
so what's the old crystal ball machine
got for me today, huh?

01:34.052 --> 01:37.097
Back to the northeast?
That's always been good turf for me.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.517
- Nice net last month.
- Well, thank you.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.644
It's the best January in years, but hey.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.772
Well, this is a shock really.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.608
What?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.986
Well, it's the last thing
I want to do, Jack.

01:51.486 --> 01:55.908
But looks like you're coming off rotation
on a permanent basis.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.536
Wait, wait.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.123
You're a numbers guy, Bill.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.668
I just told you
that was the best January in years.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.044
Yeah, well, there's the numbers

02:08.044 --> 02:10.005
and then there's the numbers
behind the numbers.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.757
No, not yet.

02:11.757 --> 02:14.218
This time next year, you are in the red.

02:14.218 --> 02:17.471
Says who? A bunch of goddamn wire--

02:17.471 --> 02:19.139
Come on, Bill.

02:20.641 --> 02:24.269
You remember when your Reggie was learning
to swim at the company picnic?

02:24.269 --> 02:25.354
He goes under--

02:25.354 --> 02:30.901
This is Processor Assisted Logic, Jack.
You can't sell your way around it.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.320
That's my job! Isn't it?

02:33.904 --> 02:36.949
So how does a processor know
who can sell and who can't sell

02:36.949 --> 02:38.867
if it can't be sold itself?

02:38.867 --> 02:39.826
You tell me that.

02:40.869 --> 02:45.457
I have got big days coming.
I've got big plans, personally.

02:45.457 --> 02:48.377
Well, that'll serve you well.
Gonna land you right on your feet.

02:48.377 --> 02:51.964
No. No, no, no, I know the job.
Thirty years.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.132
That's a whole lifetime
on other people's doorsteps.

02:54.132 --> 02:59.513
I know the job. You want me out there!
Goddamn it, Bill!

03:01.849 --> 03:05.936
I'm out there on the street.
I've seen life rip right through people.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.231
I see the stained sofas.

03:09.231 --> 03:12.526
I see the tired eyes looking up at me
from the scrap heap,

03:12.526 --> 03:14.987
looking for anybody to tell them
that it's gonna be okay.

03:14.987 --> 03:18.490
And I do it. I do it with a VegiDice.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.908
I do it with a PermPerfect

03:19.908 --> 03:22.494
or whatever other crap
y-y-you put in my hand.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.496
And I'm out there
saving people with it, Bill.

03:24.496 --> 03:28.292
I know this job. It's saving lives!

03:30.419 --> 03:31.670
That's the job.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.132
That's the job.

03:37.801 --> 03:41.513
And-- And that's gonna save you...

03:45.100 --> 03:46.185
...too, isn't it?

03:47.019 --> 03:49.563
Putting me back out there,
knowing you did what's right. Right?

04:14.087 --> 04:16.673
<i>Hiya, Jack. Sell out before lunch again?</i>

04:17.216 --> 04:18.216
Well...

04:20.636 --> 04:22.387
...time to move on, Shirl.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.308
Turn the page.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.270
<i>Turn the page?</i>

04:31.563 --> 04:34.733
You know, I got a family
I've hardly seen in 20 years.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.529
<i>I guess that never came up.</i>

04:39.655 --> 04:44.535
Been a long time, and always imagined
that I would be coming home...

04:48.038 --> 04:49.373
with something.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.669
<i>Where are you right now, Jack?</i>

04:55.921 --> 04:58.048
Life on the road moves pretty fast.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.384
<i>What's that?</i>

05:18.402 --> 05:20.863
<i>Hands in the grooming area, please.</i>

05:22.072 --> 05:24.658
<i>Hands in the grooming area, please.</i>

06:27.346 --> 06:30.140
That's the damndest foul-up
I ever did see on that machine.

06:31.099 --> 06:35.729
Gosh, talk about a hazard.
Well, I saved this as evidence.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.689
Someone owes you a new one is my thinking.

06:39.816 --> 06:44.238
I saw you blink there for a bit.
Well, thank God. You're still with us.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.866
I'm the one who sprang you
from that devil's-own sink unit.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.953
Henry Mason.
But plain old Hank will do.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.956
I never thought I'd have it in me
to save a life

06:53.956 --> 06:55.999
or guessed it'd feel half so good.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.460
I'm grateful to you, mister.

07:03.173 --> 07:06.093
I don't know what got your head
under that water,

07:06.093 --> 07:08.428
but accidents happen to each of us.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.850
The important thing
is it doesn't happen again.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.483
Thank you. Than-- Thank you.

07:24.194 --> 07:27.781
I tore the roller arms
right off that sucker to fetch you out.

07:27.781 --> 07:28.866
He got his.

07:31.994 --> 07:37.082
I guess I got mine too, far as laid off
for destruction of company property.

07:37.082 --> 07:41.295
- Don't-- You--
- Bastar-- Bastards.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.338
You bite your tongue.
I know what you're gonna say.

07:44.631 --> 07:48.677
Okay, us Masons have seen hardship
before and never not come through.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.890
All right? This is why they put
the tighter notches on the belt.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.479
Gosh, she's a beaut tonight.

08:06.111 --> 08:09.072
Always wanted to go.

08:10.782 --> 08:15.037
Same here, mister. What a dream, right?

08:17.289 --> 08:21.877
My old man used to say,
"No one is not a dreamer."

08:24.296 --> 08:25.923
Now he sounds like a wise man.

08:27.633 --> 08:30.802
Well, a salesman.

08:43.815 --> 08:47.903
- Hank Mason, is that you?
- Jack!

08:47.903 --> 08:50.531
Goodness, it is great to see you.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.408
I was half scared
you might never remember.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.701
No.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.996
Come on, and what kind of guy
would I be to forget you?

08:57.996 --> 09:00.958
- How you been all this time?
- You know, can't complain.

09:01.625 --> 09:05.546
Mr. Walter has been awful kind
to let us camp on his spread.

09:05.546 --> 09:09.132
At least, kind enough once I showed
him this with your name on it.

09:09.132 --> 09:14.304
Ah. Your contract. Lot A-1. There it is.

09:14.304 --> 09:17.891
Had it for a while.
Been holding on to it maybe...

09:18.475 --> 09:20.185
Yeah, yeah.

09:20.185 --> 09:23.146
I'm embarrassed to say your launch
got pushed back a bit.

09:24.356 --> 09:25.482
They should've called you.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.317
- But--
- We might've missed it.

09:27.317 --> 09:31.196
You know, we've been living
in the truck since I got laid off.

09:32.823 --> 09:33.824
Yeah.

09:36.243 --> 09:41.456
You know, prices on our units,
they just keep climbing.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.793
If you ever had a mind to sell,
I could get you set up for life.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.589
No, sir.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.177
You gave me this gift.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.972
And dreaming on it has been
our one spot of grace in rough waters.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.100
What's waiting a little longer?

10:04.521 --> 10:06.690
That's one beautiful frame of mind, pal.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.152
I'll start working
on getting you up there first thing.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.571
I'm forever in your debt.

10:12.571 --> 10:14.323
And us in yours, Jack.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.534
Fuck.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.996
I'm sorry about all this, Walt.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.373
Don't look like they're packing up.

10:24.374 --> 10:28.504
Our outfit does launch services
with a provider at Vista Park.

10:28.504 --> 10:31.131
I must've given him your address
by accident,

10:31.131 --> 10:33.258
and it was hectic
when I was cutting the deal.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.470
Maybe give him a couple more days?

10:36.470 --> 10:39.431
I'll get it all worked out,
make it more than worth it for you.

10:39.431 --> 10:43.101
Gotten into the moon game, huh?
Just like pops.

10:43.101 --> 10:46.563
A little different. I'm in real estate.

10:47.523 --> 10:53.153
You know... I saw a rocket the other night.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.949
Thought it might have come
from this direction.

10:56.949 --> 11:00.911
It wouldn't be too hard
to get you some work launching for us.

11:00.911 --> 11:04.748
No chance.
I shut that all down when...

11:07.751 --> 11:09.878
Hey, I wanna show you something.
Come on.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.348
Morning, kid.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.309
Morning. No Jack yet, huh?

11:24.309 --> 11:27.104
- It sounds like you got a bone a pick.
- He's just--

11:27.604 --> 11:29.857
He's always telling people
what they wanna hear.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.900
You know, he likes you, kid.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.611
I can tell he's really looking out
for you.

11:34.611 --> 11:35.863
Yeah.

11:35.863 --> 11:39.491
Now, what's the most he's ever sold
in a week? He's got the record, right?

11:40.075 --> 11:42.661
Nine. Three A-Plexes.

11:42.661 --> 11:45.998
All right. Well, I'm at six
after those golf course guys.

11:45.998 --> 11:48.917
Kept telling me I was just like them
before their first million.

11:49.543 --> 11:53.463
That means I got the whole day
to close four if I wanna top Jack.

11:53.463 --> 11:56.884
With that attitude,
he's gonna wanna piss you off more often.

11:59.595 --> 12:03.265
Apricot, which the ancients
called the fruit of forgiveness

12:03.265 --> 12:06.435
of unhinged men rehinging, atoning,

12:06.435 --> 12:11.356
just nosing to the grindstone of
general stability.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.902
- Well, you look pretty good.
- I look normal, Shirley,

12:14.902 --> 12:17.946
which I have come to accept is
more important than good.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.448
Occasionally.

12:23.202 --> 12:26.705
Good morning, ma'am. This is Joey Shorter
with Brightside Lunar Residences.

12:26.705 --> 12:29.291
Now, a new opportunity just rolled
across my desk

12:29.291 --> 12:31.919
that I'd love to talk to you about
if you have the time.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.172
I try not to get back here too much.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.715
Well, I got you beat.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.800
Been ducking this place for 40 years.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.679
Genius, your old man.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.306
Yeah, so I heard.

12:45.015 --> 12:47.142
He never really bothered
to let me get to know him.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.064
Fathers and sons.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.776
If you ask me, it was built not to work.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.570
Used to think the same thing.

13:03.492 --> 13:05.452
You know, I hit a rough patch
a while back,

13:05.452 --> 13:07.371
and I just kept hearing
his voice telling me,

13:08.205 --> 13:10.457
"No one's not a dreamer."

13:11.333 --> 13:12.918
Yeah. That one.

13:13.418 --> 13:19.091
Yeah, well, it set me back on my feet,
remembering that, so I probably...

13:20.300 --> 13:22.344
...owe him more than I care to admit.

13:25.180 --> 13:28.100
Did he ever tell you about
the subterranean power unit we drew up?

13:30.394 --> 13:33.522
Lunar temps swing 500 degrees in a day.

13:33.522 --> 13:34.982
Now, if you can harness that,

13:34.982 --> 13:38.485
we could've had enough juice
to run a whole damn mining operation.

13:39.319 --> 13:44.366
One of those, all that land he bought,
he had enough to build a whole community.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.285
Well, I never thought about it like that,

13:46.285 --> 13:48.871
but maybe you should tell
those real estate people you work for.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.707
Yeah. They know.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.086
Jack.

13:59.173 --> 14:02.384
This might be hard for you to see,
but the day it happened,

14:03.260 --> 14:05.345
I got everything I could off the tarmac.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.391
Now, as crazy as this sounds,

14:10.767 --> 14:14.146
if your daddy is anywhere, he's in there.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.749
The music can't stop, Shirl.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.334
Which means what?

14:36.418 --> 14:39.922
These things, they're worth something now.

14:39.922 --> 14:43.300
We stop selling, everybody panics,
and it all falls apart.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.636
We keep smiling, keep selling,

14:45.636 --> 14:49.181
we can make enough money
to make things right.

14:49.765 --> 14:51.975
- You mean pay people back?
- Sure.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.561
- Who pays the new customers back?
- We'll find newer customers--

14:54.561 --> 14:59.358
- That's not a solution, Jack.
- But it'll buy us enough time to find one.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.737
We sold big at that club,

15:03.737 --> 15:05.364
and none of them wanna launch
anytime soon.

15:05.364 --> 15:06.740
One day, they might.

15:08.617 --> 15:15.207
What if Jenkins had big plans,
and maybe broke ground even?

15:16.458 --> 15:20.337
What if he just never finished
what he started?

15:20.337 --> 15:22.840
More likely, he just robbed everyone.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.468
Here.

15:29.054 --> 15:30.264
A hundred and forty-three?

15:30.264 --> 15:36.478
We sell 143 units, we got all the refunds
we need and this whole thing's over.

15:37.813 --> 15:38.939
So you're with me?

15:40.649 --> 15:42.025
The music can't stop.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.030
I was thinking.

15:47.030 --> 15:50.325
That rich lady at the club,
the one batting her eyes at you?

15:51.535 --> 15:53.412
Let's sell her our whole mess.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.589
That's pretty good, Shirl.

16:03.589 --> 16:09.178
One check. We're free and clear.
Pocket change for her.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.351
You think we can pull this off?

16:16.351 --> 16:18.187
You're not that bad a liar.

16:20.606 --> 16:21.690
I guess so.

16:24.568 --> 16:28.739
Good afternoon, guest.
Can I help you with transportation?

16:32.951 --> 16:34.203
Thank you for coming, ma'am.

16:36.121 --> 16:41.877
I "apogolize."
I ceased investigations prematurely.

16:42.878 --> 16:43.879
Apologize.

16:50.344 --> 16:52.304
I thought you were
supposed to shred these.

16:53.055 --> 16:58.393
Let's say
they fell out of the feeder tray and...

16:59.353 --> 17:02.731
failed to be "sucessfully" reloaded.

17:17.663 --> 17:19.039
Brightside.

17:19.039 --> 17:24.086
<i>Joey, what a heavenly surprise!
Don't you tell me you don't remember me.</i>

17:24.086 --> 17:26.046
Of course, Mrs. Billings.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.966
<i>Is your boss around?</i>

17:30.133 --> 17:32.886
No, I haven't seen him all day,
but I can tell him you called.

17:34.972 --> 17:38.976
<i>You know,
I've been begging Jack for months</i>

17:38.976 --> 17:43.564
<i>to send one of you over
to this dungeon he's banished me to.</i>

17:44.982 --> 17:48.902
<i>People here are very well-funded.</i>

17:48.902 --> 17:50.070
Yeah?

17:50.070 --> 17:54.283
<i>Seems a shame to leave
that money on the table. But you know,</i>

17:54.283 --> 17:58.328
<i>little boys hate owing
their mothers anything</i>

17:58.328 --> 18:00.747
<i>since they actually owe them
goddamn everything.</i>

18:02.165 --> 18:05.169
Well, you know,
I could head down there today

18:05.169 --> 18:08.589
- if you think it's worth the trip.
- <i>What an idea.</i>

18:08.589 --> 18:13.302
<i>Maybe best not
to advertise it all to Jack.</i>

18:13.302 --> 18:14.803
Yeah, I can do that.

18:17.848 --> 18:19.016
Hey, what was that?

18:19.683 --> 18:21.393
Something stale on the south side.

18:22.311 --> 18:25.230
You good for new leads? I got a few
from the club I could throw your way.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.691
Yeah, I don't need your help.

18:28.442 --> 18:29.902
Loud and clear.

18:31.653 --> 18:32.654
Hey, listen.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.702
You don't want this grudge
holding you back.

18:38.702 --> 18:39.786
It won't.

18:41.830 --> 18:43.540
Well, I want to put it behind us.

18:44.541 --> 18:47.669
And since you're
on a pretty good run lately, I--

18:48.295 --> 18:49.922
I talked to Jenkins

18:50.714 --> 18:55.594
about bumping you to Senior Sales Partner.

18:55.594 --> 18:57.262
I had to stick my neck out a little,

18:57.262 --> 19:00.891
but I wanted you to know
how important you are around here,

19:00.891 --> 19:03.560
and the extra cash shouldn't hurt either.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.693
How about I take the promotion
when I earn it

19:11.693 --> 19:13.362
and not because you feel guilty?

19:13.362 --> 19:15.072
I don't need handouts.

19:15.072 --> 19:17.574
Okay, it is not a handout.

19:19.618 --> 19:22.454
Listen. This is where your boss talks
and you listen. Got it?

19:25.958 --> 19:28.752
This is a good thing for you.
You might wanna act a little grateful.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.634
I got a lot of work to do,
so I'll see you later.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.388
Okay. Right. Well, hey, go get 'em! Right?

19:39.388 --> 19:42.140
You know, a couple of entries
on the right side of the ledger,

19:42.140 --> 19:44.017
it's got a way of fixing everything.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.311
Yeah. You know,
you could've just said you're sorry.

19:50.607 --> 19:53.277
Are you doing
the head-in-your-hands thing again?

19:53.277 --> 19:58.866
It's just, the twins should have
a Senior Sales Partner as a dad.

19:59.867 --> 20:03.036
Okay. Unlock the door or--

20:03.036 --> 20:06.582
I'm gonna pee on this carpet
right this minute!

20:10.752 --> 20:16.091
Okay. I have something to tell you,
Herbie, that I think will help.

20:18.177 --> 20:21.180
Turns out, I'm not as pregnant
as I thought I was.

20:25.142 --> 20:26.143
No.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.478
No. No, not like that.

20:29.146 --> 20:32.065
Like, maybe, I never was.

20:33.150 --> 20:36.778
I mean, I was sure of it,
and we were so happy.

20:36.778 --> 20:40.282
But then, Dr. Ergomano
had this different opinion

20:40.282 --> 20:43.327
which I realized was actually correct.

20:44.828 --> 20:48.707
I thought we could just, you know,
fix it at the club. But...

20:49.333 --> 20:53.170
So... you lied to me then?

20:53.170 --> 20:57.257
No.
It's not a lie if I believed it. Right?

20:57.925 --> 20:59.009
No.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.433
I think, technically, it is.

21:09.144 --> 21:13.232
W-We can make it true, Herbie.

21:27.913 --> 21:33.710
Does this entryway
look 8-30B compliant to you?

21:34.545 --> 21:37.464
Jesus, is that good? Where are we?

21:37.464 --> 21:41.552
With respect, ma'am,
the documents show one John Billings,

21:41.552 --> 21:44.179
father to Jack,
as the "incorportating" officer.

21:44.179 --> 21:46.557
And an assets
and "libatillities" cross-reference

21:46.557 --> 21:48.433
shows that John as the owner

21:48.433 --> 21:52.437
of an extensive extra-atmospheric
launch facility which,

21:52.938 --> 21:55.566
"susquebent" to his demise
and financial ruin,

21:55.566 --> 21:59.194
transferred to a former associate,
one Walter Greene, where--

21:59.194 --> 22:01.405
So... they own this launchpad?

22:01.405 --> 22:05.033
Or Billings who runs the company owns it?
Or his dad?

22:05.033 --> 22:10.289
Exactly. The licensed premises
of John Billings's registered entity,

22:10.289 --> 22:13.375
i.e. the Brightside "Corportation."

22:15.419 --> 22:16.879
Wait.

22:19.089 --> 22:20.090
Wait.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.302
This is fucking it?

22:24.261 --> 22:25.470
Well,

22:25.470 --> 22:31.393
while we can't conclude
this is all the "it" there is,

22:31.393 --> 22:33.562
it certainly is an "it."

22:42.529 --> 22:46.200
- This fucking dump is all they've got.
- Yeah.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.328
Good luck getting to the moon
from this place, right?

22:51.788 --> 22:55.918
Oh, my God, it's all bullshit.

22:56.668 --> 22:57.836
<i>Hey!</i>

22:57.836 --> 23:00.047
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- <i>Get down!</i>

23:00.047 --> 23:02.883
Direct contact
is well-beyond current prerogative.

23:02.883 --> 23:05.802
<i>Final warning, lady.</i>

23:05.802 --> 23:08.138
Fuck off!

23:15.020 --> 23:16.063
Mrs. Mayburn.

23:20.275 --> 23:21.276
We got him.

23:24.112 --> 23:25.280
You got him.

23:30.202 --> 23:32.204
I feel a "bingo" coming on.

23:33.872 --> 23:37.876
B-8. B-8, lucky ladies and gents.

23:38.377 --> 23:39.378
That's me.

23:39.378 --> 23:42.923
You know, I'm not sure
anyone here would survive the trip up.

23:42.923 --> 23:45.133
They don't know that.

23:46.426 --> 23:50.722
This is a desperate
and lonely place, Joe.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.224
G-47.

23:52.224 --> 23:53.725
Trish over here.

23:55.018 --> 23:59.439
She lost her husband last year,
and a lung last month.

24:00.607 --> 24:05.070
She would buy anything if you smile
and tell her you like her hair.

24:11.743 --> 24:14.830
Yeah, I don't know,
it just feels a little

24:15.372 --> 24:16.456
wrong.

24:17.416 --> 24:18.750
You're right, you're right.

24:18.750 --> 24:23.463
What a decent, caring,
incorruptible young man you are.

24:23.463 --> 24:26.925
- I-24.
- You must visit your mother often.

24:28.719 --> 24:31.430
Well, I used to go around
almost every day,

24:31.430 --> 24:34.183
but it's harder now with the job.

24:34.183 --> 24:39.146
Yeah, and she's, well...
and here I am wide-awake.

24:39.646 --> 24:43.233
And Jack's in agony
over the slightest visit.

24:43.984 --> 24:45.319
B-7.

24:45.319 --> 24:46.737
I have that.

24:46.737 --> 24:49.239
They haven't called that number yet.

24:49.239 --> 24:53.869
They don't check.
Unless you're gonna rat me out.

24:54.745 --> 24:58.582
- No, never.
- N-36.

24:58.582 --> 25:01.043
- Bingo. Bingo!
- Bingo!

25:01.043 --> 25:04.755
Stop the draw.
Bring me my dumb box of chocolates.

25:06.757 --> 25:07.758
Oh, boy.

25:08.383 --> 25:09.676
They never stood a chance.

25:10.385 --> 25:11.386
All right.

25:11.386 --> 25:13.639
I ought to head out
and try to make a few more sales.

25:13.639 --> 25:16.975
What? And make me eat my chocolates alone?

25:17.809 --> 25:18.936
Nah.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.022
No, never.

25:25.317 --> 25:27.110
Let me tell you something.

25:28.612 --> 25:32.491
An honest day's work is no fucking joke, Shirley.

25:36.537 --> 25:38.038
Welcome home, champ.

25:38.705 --> 25:39.706
What are you,

25:39.706 --> 25:42.709
rewarding me to mold my behavior
like the dog with the bell?

25:43.585 --> 25:45.087
Listen.

25:45.087 --> 25:46.505
I'm very, very accepting of it.

25:46.505 --> 25:48.090
Well, let me show you something.

25:48.090 --> 25:52.928
Try to only get very, very...

25:54.721 --> 25:55.764
excited.

25:58.767 --> 25:59.768
Whose is this?

26:02.729 --> 26:03.981
Yours.

26:03.981 --> 26:06.608
Mine? Who's coming to kill me for it?

26:06.608 --> 26:09.444
It's honest American business, Ed.

26:09.444 --> 26:13.031
I saw an opening.
Flipped our moon unit for twice the price.

26:13.532 --> 26:15.450
No, you didn't. You didn't.

26:15.450 --> 26:17.703
Yeah, don't argue
with a bag of money, right?

26:17.703 --> 26:20.247
We still want a spot up there,
we can buy two.

26:21.456 --> 26:24.835
Kind of had my heart
set on that one, Shirley. Ours.

26:24.835 --> 26:29.756
I'd be happy anywhere with you, Ed.
I'm happy here. Right now.

26:30.924 --> 26:33.260
Who even needs the moon? Yeah?

26:37.055 --> 26:38.056
Okay.

26:38.891 --> 26:41.101
I didn't humiliate myself
in that place, Shirley,

26:41.101 --> 26:44.855
'cause I felt iffy about you,
or I wanted to do better business deals.

26:44.855 --> 26:49.026
I mean, love isn't some frozen pizza
you can just have now or later.

26:49.026 --> 26:50.235
That's not what this is.

26:50.235 --> 26:53.405
Okay, then it's a managed fucking exit
from the quagmire you believe me to--

26:53.405 --> 26:55.407
Did I say any of that?

26:55.407 --> 26:58.327
Bag says it, Shirley. Bag says it all.

26:58.327 --> 26:59.953
No-- Jesus, Ed, I love you.

26:59.953 --> 27:02.831
You know, I wouldn't be surprised
if you expected me to piss it away

27:02.831 --> 27:08.629
in my usual manner, freeing you forever
from our dumb dreams together. Jesus.

27:16.178 --> 27:17.262
You ever been up there?

27:17.262 --> 27:20.224
Ha! You'd have to kill me and ship me.

27:22.392 --> 27:25.312
That was a gift from my late husband.

27:27.314 --> 27:28.524
Say, Joey...

27:30.859 --> 27:35.572
there are some things
you should know about Jack.

27:36.490 --> 27:40.327
And all of the Billings men, really.

27:40.953 --> 27:41.954
Okay.

27:43.455 --> 27:48.919
They are insufferable dreamers.
But don't hold that against him.

27:48.919 --> 27:52.089
It's the only way he knows
to show he cares, and he does care.

27:52.673 --> 27:58.720
He loves you. He just gets
a couple of things dead wrong sometimes.

27:59.263 --> 28:00.514
Can you see that?

28:01.682 --> 28:06.895
'Cause you probably got some of it
in you too. After all, he is--

28:06.895 --> 28:10.065
- Get dead, space scum!
- I'm not quite sure I can help with that.

28:10.065 --> 28:15.696
Get a taste of rough-and-ready lawman,
you one-eyed Gargon savage!

28:15.696 --> 28:17.197
Buck. Buck M--

28:17.197 --> 28:18.490
Mr. Manzell?

28:20.284 --> 28:22.995
Who asked, interloper?

28:22.995 --> 28:26.915
You some Gargon-sympathizing rat fink?

28:26.915 --> 28:28.500
Don't bother, Joe.

28:28.500 --> 28:31.837
Somebody probably let him watch
all his reruns again.

28:31.837 --> 28:33.213
He's not on the moon?

28:33.213 --> 28:37.092
If you told him he was,
he'd probably believe you.

28:37.092 --> 28:40.596
N-No. Freeze, brain-scrambler!

28:41.305 --> 28:43.807
M-Mr. Manzell. Mr. Manzell.

28:45.642 --> 28:49.521
- Mr. Manzell!
- He's warming up.

28:50.606 --> 28:52.149
A neutron gas attack.

28:54.401 --> 28:57.237
Cover your ears and nose, Mr. Jenkins.

29:01.491 --> 29:03.702
- Mr. Jenkins.
- I'm out of ammo.

29:03.702 --> 29:06.622
Come on, Mr. Jenkins. Stay down, stay low.

29:09.416 --> 29:12.920
Senior partner. Sales.

29:16.173 --> 29:17.174
Hey, pal.

29:18.884 --> 29:22.846
Hit me with some of that
insufferable sunshine of yours, will you?

29:24.056 --> 29:29.603
Well, Betty, bad. Joey, bad. Jack, bad.

29:31.063 --> 29:36.401
Our twins who don't actually exist,
more bad than when they did.

29:37.152 --> 29:38.195
Christ.

29:39.488 --> 29:42.699
You see, there's pain, Eddie.

29:44.451 --> 29:45.911
And then there's lying to yourself.

29:48.956 --> 29:50.457
That's the world in a nutshell.

29:53.669 --> 29:55.212
Get another one over here, please.

29:58.799 --> 30:01.093
She's on the hook, our wealthy widow.

30:01.093 --> 30:02.803
- Dinner and a sales pitch.
- Good.

30:04.596 --> 30:07.641
I came by for a pep talk.
I feel like I stepped into a funeral.

30:07.641 --> 30:13.730
Sorry. Get this done, Jack, please. 143.

30:13.730 --> 30:16.233
Okay. To the moon.

30:25.409 --> 30:26.827
Good evening, guest.

30:26.827 --> 30:29.288
Would you like me
to assist you with transportation?

30:31.373 --> 30:33.166
Hey. Hey!

30:33.959 --> 30:37.838
Hey, kid. I got a meeting I'm about to--
Joey, what?

30:37.838 --> 30:39.339
I just ran into Buck Manzell.

30:42.176 --> 30:44.386
Yeah. What a guy.

30:44.386 --> 30:46.805
What a fella, right?
I heard that he was back in town.

30:46.805 --> 30:47.973
No, don't-- don't do that.

30:47.973 --> 30:50.225
- Welcome back to The Vista Motor Lodge.
- You fucking liar.

30:50.225 --> 30:53.937
Hey. Look, I don't know
what you think you know, Joe.

30:54.438 --> 30:56.064
- But it's not the whole story.
- Come on, Jack.

30:56.064 --> 30:57.900
What are we selling here, pieces of paper?

30:58.567 --> 31:01.111
- I mean, is there anything real?
- Hey, it's all real.

31:02.029 --> 31:03.906
How do you think anything real
in this world

31:03.906 --> 31:05.949
gets started by guys like you and me?

31:06.825 --> 31:08.577
I don't think I'm anything like you.

31:08.577 --> 31:11.788
Grow up, kid. We're both nobody.

31:12.956 --> 31:14.791
You think I didn't try to do this
the right way?

31:14.791 --> 31:17.628
Go around hat-in-hand,
get laughed out of every room.

31:17.628 --> 31:19.838
I'm about to have a meeting
with an investor

31:19.838 --> 31:23.258
who can get this whole thing up
and running with one deal.

31:23.258 --> 31:27.137
- It's getting realer every day.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

31:27.137 --> 31:28.472
We all believed you, Jack.

31:28.972 --> 31:31.850
- I mean, I lied to everybody. I--
- You did the job I asked.

31:33.644 --> 31:34.645
Better than most.

31:34.645 --> 31:38.398
That's not lying.
That's making things possible.

31:40.067 --> 31:41.068
Look at me, kid.

31:42.528 --> 31:45.072
This is the most important lesson
of your life.

31:47.074 --> 31:50.661
Getting stuck in the details
and the doubt?

31:51.620 --> 31:54.373
It'll kill you. I've been there.

31:56.917 --> 31:58.627
You just knew that I'd fall for it.

31:59.795 --> 32:01.630
Right? When you-- When you first met me,

32:01.630 --> 32:04.174
- because I'm just the right kind of loser.
- No. Stop!

32:04.174 --> 32:08.971
Don't do that. I'm gonna build
every unit we sold, trust me.

32:08.971 --> 32:12.182
Trust you?
Stan Jenkins is a fucking turtle.

32:12.182 --> 32:15.936
All right, keep it down, keep it down.
Think about if this gets out.

32:16.854 --> 32:19.690
Do you want to be the one
who killed their dreams?

32:20.274 --> 32:22.025
Who blew up their investments?

32:24.862 --> 32:26.780
That's our ship coming in.

32:26.780 --> 32:30.617
And I met her at the club, so really
you're the one who made it happen.

32:30.617 --> 32:32.452
You should be a goddamn partner.

32:36.456 --> 32:38.250
Quit fucking dreaming.
