I had a while ago?

27:21.125 --> 27:23.750
This whole time I thought
I was texting my dream girl,

27:23.833 --> 27:24.916
I'm texting that girl.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.166
Dude, that happened to me.
I accidentally sent my uncle a dick pic.

27:28.250 --> 27:32.291
He saw it, had a stroke. It was awful.
It was like a nightmare for our family.

27:32.375 --> 27:34.416
I don't give a fuck
about your uncle at all.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.125
This is real. What do I do?

27:36.208 --> 27:37.458
Dude, just come clean.

27:37.541 --> 27:40.333
I wanted to, but then she told me
she was feeling suicidal

27:40.416 --> 27:41.625
until I started texting her.

27:41.708 --> 27:43.791
Who are we
to get in the way of destiny, man?<i> </i>

27:43.875 --> 27:47.166

27:48.666 --> 27:49.875

-No--

-Sir, I'd like to introduce you--
-[Winstone] I know who he is.

27:52.875 --> 27:54.875

27:54.958 --> 27:56.208

27:56.291 --> 27:58.333
[laughs] Well, that's nice. Nice.

27:58.416 --> 28:00.208
Your name's been mentioned
quite a bit, Jim.

28:00.291 --> 28:03.291
Oh. Actually, it's Tim. Tim Morris.
But thank you, sir.

28:03.375 --> 28:05.791
-I have your coffee, sir.
-I didn't want a coffee.

that Nate keeps bragging to me about?

28:16.083 --> 28:17.916
-Oh.
-Wait, wait, wait, Tim. Get this.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.833
-Mr. Winstone's wife was Miss Texas.
-No!

28:21.916 --> 28:25.916
That's right. And before that,
she dated Evander Holyfield.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.250

-More like "holy shit".

Good. That's a good one.

28:33.208 --> 28:35.458
My husband, Paul,
was a Guess Jeans model.

28:35.541 --> 28:38.083

and a great ass.

28:38.166 --> 28:41.583

on Claudia Schiffer's torso.

28:41.666 --> 28:43.375

28:45.791 --> 28:47.791
uh, isn't feeling quite herself today.

28:47.875 --> 28:48.708
Oh, is she sick?

28:48.791 --> 28:50.083
You could say that.

28:50.166 --> 28:52.791
You know, uh, I don't even know
if we'll see her the whole weekend.

28:52.875 --> 28:55.125
She's suffering from severe jet lag.

28:55.208 --> 28:57.958
-From a five-hour flight?
-Well, she also had flown in from Paris.

28:58.041 --> 28:59.541
-Fashion Week and all that.
-Yeah.

28:59.625 --> 29:01.750
Oh, well, you know, that makes more sense.

29:01.833 --> 29:03.791

29:05.458 --> 29:08.291
Yup. Uh, in the old days, she was.
So, you know...

Not to brag, but the wife and I
are defending doubles champions

29:11.166 --> 29:12.000

35:56.541 --> 35:57.375
Nope.

35:59.750 --> 36:01.500
Mmm. Dog pills.

36:06.458 --> 36:07.833
[woman moaning]

36:07.916 --> 36:09.166
[woman] <i>You're my man.</i>

36:09.250 --> 36:11.041
You're the only man for me.

36:11.125 --> 36:14.166
[grunts] I miss you so much.
I want you so bad.

36:14.250 --> 36:16.583
You dirty little dog, you bury that bone.

36:16.666 --> 36:18.625
-Huh?
-Oh, you bury it.

36:18.708 --> 36:19.833
-Yeah, you bury it!
-Ow!

36:19.916 --> 36:21.541
-You bury it!
-Aah!

36:21.625 --> 36:24.166
-[screaming] You bury it!
-Oh!

36:25.208 --> 36:26.416
-Missy?
-[panting]

36:26.500 --> 36:29.083
-What are we doing?!
-Um, having sex?

36:29.416 --> 36:31.458
You kept jamming
your little morning wood into my back

36:31.541 --> 36:33.375
and saying, "Oh, I want you so bad."

36:33.458 --> 36:34.375
[laughs]

36:34.458 --> 36:36.833
Oh, you're fuckfacing me,
aren't you? Cool!

36:36.916 --> 36:38.833
-No, no, I'm not! No.
-Yes, you are!

36:38.916 --> 36:41.166
Yeah, it's okay.
I'm doing it to you, too, Simon Cowell.

36:41.250 --> 36:43.875
Now close your eyes
and tell me I suck at singing!

36:43.958 --> 36:44.958

36:45.041 --> 36:46.375
You're going to Hollywood!

36:51.583 --> 36:54.041
-She's sleeping.
-<i>Oh, my God! You fucked her, didn't you?</i>

36:54.125 --> 36:55.500
-No, I didn't.
<i>-You sound defensive.</i>

36:55.583 --> 36:57.583
-Nate, I did not.
<i>-Did you stand on a phone book?</i>

36:57.666 --> 36:58.708
I didn't fuck her, I swear.

36:58.791 --> 37:00.833
<i>-Swear on your grandma's life?</i>
-Fine. She fucked me.

37:00.916 --> 37:02.333
-See you soon.

[Missy snoring loudly]

37:09.500 --> 37:11.500
[snoring continues]

37:31.166 --> 37:34.291
[Winstone] Welcome
to Mr. Winstone's version of <i>Shark Tank!</i>

37:34.375 --> 37:36.416
-[man] Yeah!
-[crowd applauding]

37:39.083 --> 37:40.125
I don't want coffee.

37:41.125 --> 37:43.375
Now, this is the real shark tank.

37:43.458 --> 37:47.208
There's no lights, no cameras,
but one whole hell of a lot more action.

37:47.833 --> 37:51.708
Because, you see, here, instead of facing
Mark Cuban or Mr. Wonderful,

37:51.791 --> 37:54.291
you'll be facing actual sharks,

37:54.375 --> 37:58.666
which my new friend Komante here tells me
are known all too well in these waters.

37:58.750 --> 37:59.583
Komante?

38:03.666 --> 38:06.041
There's sharks
all over this goddamn place.

38:07.041 --> 38:08.833
Komante, uh, what happened
to your fingers?

38:09.416 --> 38:10.250
I...

38:11.041 --> 38:12.333
[exhaling]

38:14.125 --> 38:15.083
Huh.

38:15.166 --> 38:16.250
-Oh, my God.
-[Winstone laughs]

38:16.333 --> 38:20.333
I warned you there'd be no weak-ass
trust fall kind of crap this weekend.

38:20.416 --> 38:22.291
And so, without further ado,

38:22.875 --> 38:24.291
what do you say we set sail?

38:24.375 --> 38:25.333
-Woo!
-Let's do it!

38:25.416 --> 38:26.625
[crowd applauding]

38:27.208 --> 38:28.708
Let's go fuck up some sharks.

38:28.791 --> 38:30.041
[laughs]

38:30.125 --> 38:30.958
[Winstone laughs]

38:31.041 --> 38:32.333
[Missy] Timmy!

38:33.250 --> 38:34.500
Don't take off!

38:35.250 --> 38:36.166
Oh, shit.

38:36.250 --> 38:37.208
Go, go.

38:37.291 --> 38:39.083
I'm coming, Timmy!

38:39.166 --> 38:40.416
Go, go, go, go, go!

38:40.500 --> 38:41.833
Oh, shit. Let's go.

38:41.916 --> 38:43.583
-Hey, help me with the rope.
-[Missy] Tim!

38:43.666 --> 38:46.250
Thank you. We gotta get going.
Come on! What are we doing?

38:46.333 --> 38:47.916
Let's go on this piece of shit.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.291
-Go! Hustle! Go!
-I'm coming!

38:50.375 --> 38:51.416
[Tim] She's catching up.

38:51.500 --> 38:52.916
You fucking cheetah. My God.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.375
Hold the fucking boat!

38:54.958 --> 38:57.500
-Shit.
-I love you, Tim Morris!

39:21.708 --> 39:22.750

39:23.416 --> 39:24.458
Oh, shit.

39:24.541 --> 39:26.875

39:26.958 --> 39:29.333
There she is. [laughing] Hey...

39:29.416 --> 39:30.250
[spits]

39:31.458 --> 39:33.833
[in evil voice]
You can't stop the Hellstar!

39:33.916 --> 39:35.041
[Tim] No, no.

39:35.125 --> 39:37.166
[laughs] There's my baby.

39:37.250 --> 39:39.500
Oh, my God! You made it.

39:40.083 --> 39:40.916
Yeah, I did.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.375
-Let's join the party.
-Hey.

39:45.708 --> 39:47.166
[dramatic music plays]

39:50.000 --> 39:51.791
[Winstone]
Well, Stuart, any sharks?

39:51.875 --> 39:55.416
Unfortunately not, sir.
But I think I saw some salmon.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.500
Salmon?

39:56.833 --> 39:57.666
Jesus!

39:58.458 --> 40:00.708
All right, that's it. I'm going back down.

40:00.791 --> 40:04.208
We don't head back to the hotel
until we see at least one goddamn shark.

40:05.083 --> 40:06.416
Ted!

40:06.500 --> 40:07.708
You and me. Let's go.

40:07.791 --> 40:10.833
It's Tim, sir, but, uh... you know what?
I probably shouldn't right now.

40:10.916 --> 40:13.166
Why not? You haven't even been
in the water yet.

40:13.250 --> 40:15.416
-[man laughs]
-You're not chicken shit, are you?

40:15.500 --> 40:17.208
[laughs] No.

40:17.291 --> 40:19.458
Definitely not chicken shit.
No, never chicken shit.

40:19.541 --> 40:22.375
-Well, then, what's the matter?
-It's actually, it's... It's more Missy.

40:22.458 --> 40:25.083
She's uh... She suffers
from severe seasickness.

40:25.166 --> 40:26.375
No, I don't.

40:26.458 --> 40:29.375
Yes, you do. You...
And you just got over that jet lag.

40:29.458 --> 40:31.166
-But I want to go down there. Seems fun.
-No.

40:31.250 --> 40:33.166
But, you know, anyone can do it.
I won't get mad.

40:33.250 --> 40:35.916
-You can go. You can go. I'll go last.
-Tim, you need to go.

40:36.458 --> 40:37.291
[whispers] Do it.

40:37.375 --> 40:40.916
I don't need to go. And you're not
fucking fine, remember?

40:41.000 --> 40:44.166
You're not fucking fine,
and I need to be with you.

40:44.250 --> 40:46.125
No, you fucking don't!<i> </i>

40:46.625 --> 40:49.916
Go! Before I bitch-slap you
in front of all these motherfuckers.

40:51.416 --> 40:52.250
We were...

40:52.333 --> 40:54.250
-We were goofing around on my end.
-Go.

40:59.916 --> 41:01.791
Are you sure you should be doing this?

41:03.125 --> 41:04.166
Oh. [chuckles]

41:04.791 --> 41:06.416
Uh, sure, I'm sure.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.083
I ain't "scurred."

41:09.958 --> 41:10.916
No, I'm cool.

41:11.000 --> 41:11.833
Cool.

41:13.208 --> 41:14.875
But as we both know,
you're claustrophobic.

41:14.958 --> 41:18.416
Can't imagine anything more claustrophobic
than being confined to a cage.

41:19.125 --> 41:20.041
Yeah.

41:20.125 --> 41:21.875
I know this is
a really big weekend for you,

41:21.958 --> 41:23.666
and you've worked so hard
for this promotion.

41:23.750 --> 41:27.166
I just don't know that this is the best
opportunity to impress your boss.

41:27.833 --> 41:28.833
Tim, I just...

41:29.625 --> 41:32.458
-I would never want you to--
-[Winstone] Let's go! Daylight's burning.

41:32.541 --> 41:34.916
We're not gonna see any Great Whites
up on the fucking deck.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.125
[Tim] Ah...

41:40.000 --> 41:41.500
That's what I'm talking about!

41:41.791 --> 41:43.166
Let's get this wussy wet.

It's okay.

41:55.708 --> 41:57.125
[sucks air]

41:57.208 --> 41:59.458
-You're good. Go ahead, grab it.
-Put that in my mouth now?

41:59.541 --> 42:01.916
-Yeah, it goes right in your mouth.
-Yeah, Ted!

42:02.875 --> 42:03.958
Hey.

42:04.333 --> 42:06.416
If you see the shark that did this to me,

42:07.208 --> 42:08.250
you tell him,

42:08.708 --> 42:09.625
from me...

42:10.458 --> 42:11.750
"Wassup?

42:11.833 --> 42:13.625
Wassup, baby?"

42:13.708 --> 42:16.000
Excuse me. I gotta take this. Wassup?

Oh, hey, what is that?

43:04.041 --> 43:05.000
Is that chum?

43:05.750 --> 43:07.333
It says "No chum."

43:07.416 --> 43:08.625
It's illegal!

43:08.708 --> 43:10.083
Okay. Well, there's no sharks,

43:10.166 --> 43:11.833
so I'm trying to make it
a little more fun.

43:11.916 --> 43:14.625
This is supposed to be our lunch.
We're gonna eat this later.

43:14.708 --> 43:15.541
It's soup!

43:15.625 --> 43:17.125
What happens if sharks smell chum?

44:01.333 --> 44:03.958
It's what I do. I find sharks! Yes!

Thought it was good.
I can see why you wouldn't.

44:37.916 --> 44:40.500
I didn't think the whale was likable.
Got to have a likable whale.

44:40.583 --> 44:43.208

an asshole, who's gonna care?

I was just trying to create a magical
moment between you and your boss.

46:22.125 --> 46:25.250

"Absolutely no chumming"?

It wasn't chum. It was my throw-up
from smelling the chum.

46:28.791 --> 46:30.541
What were you thinking, throwing up, then,

46:30.625 --> 46:33.375
directly over the shark cage
that I was in?

46:33.458 --> 46:35.500
You know, you need to take
a chill pill, okay?

46:35.583 --> 46:38.833
Oh, why don't you write me a prescription?
You're a fucking doctor of 50,000 things.

46:38.916 --> 46:41.125
Actually, I would never write
a prescription for something

46:41.208 --> 46:42.583
if I'm not certified to do so.

46:43.166 --> 46:46.291
What? I already said I'm sorry
I almost killed your boss.

46:46.375 --> 46:48.500
-What more do you want?
-Not to almost kill my boss.

46:48.583 --> 46:49.625
It would be a huge help.

46:49.708 --> 46:50.875
Okay, you know what, Tim?

46:50.958 --> 46:53.541
If you want some girl
who's just gonna sit at the hotel

46:53.625 --> 46:55.166
and just be so happy every night

46:55.250 --> 46:57.458
like a boring sack of potatoes

46:57.541 --> 46:59.583

I just wear flats around him.

Don't degrade yourself
by begging for my forgiveness.

47:54.458 --> 47:57.625
-I'm actually not.
-You gotta meet our neighbor, Barbara.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.791
She and her husband
heard us going at it last night.

47:59.875 --> 48:01.875
-[mumbles]
-They almost called security.

48:01.958 --> 48:04.500
They thought there was a little girl
being tortured in here.

48:05.083 --> 48:06.875
-You're the little girl.
-Yes, I understand.

48:06.958 --> 48:08.125
Did you? Did you get that?

48:08.208 --> 48:09.666
-In that scenario, yes.
-Mm-hmm.

48:09.750 --> 48:10.791
I feel bad for her though.

48:10.875 --> 48:12.791
She said her husband hasn't made
a noise like that

48:12.875 --> 48:14.541
since their honeymoon 30 years ago.

48:15.125 --> 48:18.083

48:19.791 --> 48:21.041

-Give tips.

48:21.125 --> 48:22.250
People don't like tips.

48:22.333 --> 48:23.791
-People love tips.
-No.

48:23.875 --> 48:24.958
-They do.
-No.

48:25.041 --> 48:26.541
-They like advice tips.
-No.

-Cash tips.
-No.

48:28.250 --> 48:29.708
-Your dick tip.
-Hey! No. Missy.

48:29.791 --> 48:31.666
-They love your dick tip.
-Missy. Missy!

-I'm just try--
-Your dick tip!

48:35.875 --> 48:37.458
-Don't hit it right on--
-Let me touch it!

48:37.541 --> 48:39.000
-You touched it.
-You're such a bitch.

48:39.083 --> 48:41.000
Come on. Listen. I'm sorry.

48:41.083 --> 48:42.083
-All right.
-Now...

48:42.500 --> 48:44.250
I have to go meet with my team,

48:46.208 --> 48:47.208
-Okay?
-Aww. [meows]

48:47.291 --> 48:49.791
This is a real work thing.
So, I'm not kidding.

48:50.125 --> 48:51.083
It's perfect, actually.

48:51.166 --> 48:54.458
Barbara and I were talking about going
to the spa and having a little girl time.

48:56.041 --> 48:57.041
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

48:57.666 --> 48:58.625
That's a good idea.

48:58.708 --> 49:00.166
You should go to a spa,

49:00.250 --> 49:03.333
and then maybe, you know, like canoe out
to an island and just chill,

49:03.416 --> 49:05.416

-Mmm.

is still here.

[sighs] I was hoping you killed her.

49:46.291 --> 49:49.375
No. She's at the spa.
She made fast friends with our neighbor.

-What neighbor?
-I don't know, the lady right next to us.

49:53.041 --> 49:55.291
Please tell me her name is not Barbara.

Her name's Missy.

And, uh, somebody told me that classes
were a really good way to meet people,

and kind of became a jack-of-all-trades.

I'm excited about this next party.

1:11:20.375 --> 1:11:22.750

It'll be fun.

1:11:23.291 --> 1:11:25.291
[Missy] I think you might be
a bit over-dressed.

1:11:25.375 --> 1:11:28.541
I know people are kind of on the fence,
but the merger's gonna be huge, dude.

1:11:28.625 --> 1:11:30.625
It's gonna help all of us.
We're gonna crush it.

1:11:30.708 --> 1:11:32.416
It's really exciting
to see how it plays out.

-Hmm.
-Hmm.

1:11:37.916 --> 1:11:41.041
Rich, what the hell's going on here?
It's supposed to be a pig roast.

1:11:41.125 --> 1:11:43.541
No, Winstone changed the whole party
last minute.

1:11:43.625 --> 1:11:45.125
He said he wants everyone to get back

1:11:45.208 --> 1:11:48.041
to a time before society
told you what you can and can't do.

1:11:48.125 --> 1:11:50.250
That's weird. Why are you
staring at this tree, though?

1:11:50.333 --> 1:11:52.583
Fucking Winstone put me in a time-out.

1:11:53.166 --> 1:11:55.041
[exhales] I still got ten minutes left.

1:11:55.125 --> 1:11:56.000
Carry on.

1:11:56.833 --> 1:11:57.916
So, you had a part in this.

1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.416
Winstone was so concerned
with what everyone thought about him,

1:12:00.500 --> 1:12:02.333
and he wanted to think more freely.

1:12:02.416 --> 1:12:06.416
So while he was hypnotized, I told him
to throw away the restraints of adulthood.

1:12:06.500 --> 1:12:08.291
-Guess he ran with it.
-Mr. Morris?

1:12:08.375 --> 1:12:11.208
Mr. Winstone's conducting interviews
in the ocean.

1:12:11.291 --> 1:12:12.625
He would like for you to be next,

1:12:12.708 --> 1:12:15.458
or he'll tell everyone
you still sleep with a nightlight.

1:12:17.083 --> 1:12:18.208
Thank you, giraffe.

1:12:18.291 --> 1:12:19.208
You're welcome.

1:12:19.833 --> 1:12:22.416
I think we need to look
into selling asset-backed securities.

1:12:22.500 --> 1:12:23.458
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:12:23.541 --> 1:12:25.166
Uh, tell me underwater.

1:12:25.250 --> 1:12:26.125
I'm sorry?

1:12:26.208 --> 1:12:28.333
Tell me underwater. We're mermaids.

1:12:28.416 --> 1:12:30.000
But you won't be able to understand me.

1:12:30.083 --> 1:12:31.333
Of course I will.

1:12:31.666 --> 1:12:32.791
We're mermaids.

1:12:35.791 --> 1:12:36.958

1:12:55.416 --> 1:12:56.291

1:12:57.250 --> 1:12:58.208

1:13:39.750 --> 1:13:41.083
Now listen, Tim,

1:13:41.166 --> 1:13:44.208
I am well aware
that you want to be president of sales,

1:13:44.583 --> 1:13:48.375
but I have to be honest with you,
Jess' numbers are much better than yours.

1:13:48.458 --> 1:13:49.916
She's an excellent motivator,

1:13:50.708 --> 1:13:53.625
and she's a pretty damn good
underwater talker.

1:13:54.458 --> 1:13:57.541
But I get the feeling
that you're the type of guy

1:13:57.625 --> 1:13:59.791
that would bring me soup
when I'm sick, you know?

1:14:00.666 --> 1:14:01.666
Yes.

1:14:01.750 --> 1:14:02.791
Sure, that's...

1:14:02.875 --> 1:14:03.708
Of course.

1:14:03.791 --> 1:14:06.333
Tell me stories about
how you met Grandpa after World War II.

1:14:06.416 --> 1:14:07.583
[laughs] Yeah.

1:14:07.666 --> 1:14:10.791
Let me eat as much chocolate as I wanted,
no matter what Mom and Dad said.

1:14:11.291 --> 1:14:12.125
Y-Yeah.

1:14:12.208 --> 1:14:14.458
And that's why I've decided
to go with my gut.

1:14:15.333 --> 1:14:16.166

1:14:16.250 --> 1:14:18.000

I don't know what witchcraft
you whipped up with Winstone,

but obviously, it worked.

1:14:38.250 --> 1:14:39.833
Oh, good. I'm glad you noticed.

1:14:39.916 --> 1:14:42.291
I'm sorry. I can't do anything
for your husband's eye, though.

Either way,
we're gonna definitely celebrate.

So, let me get the sand
out of places it shouldn't be,

1:15:08.666 --> 1:15:10.833

1:15:10.916 --> 1:15:13.208

why don't you bring your friend Hellstar?
