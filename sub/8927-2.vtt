WEBVTT

00:01.088 --> 00:02.888
Are you the liaison
sent by the Admiralty?

00:02.934 --> 00:03.995
I am, my lord.

00:03.996 --> 00:06.975
I intend to save Nassau
before she's lost forever.

00:07.010 --> 00:09.427
Hornigold provided security for
the consortium's operations.

00:09.429 --> 00:11.312
You'd like me to fill
that role for you now?

00:11.348 --> 00:13.398
If your friends aren't capable
of protecting themselves,

00:13.433 --> 00:14.593
they aren't worth protecting.

00:14.601 --> 00:15.850
- ELEANOR: What's your name?
- Ned Low.

00:15.902 --> 00:17.686
It would be a shame
to make enemies of each other

00:17.738 --> 00:20.355
- over such a small amount of money.
- Get out of my place.

00:20.407 --> 00:23.358
Hell of a prize, Mr. Meeks.
Hell of a prize.

00:23.370 --> 00:25.171
MAX: Perhaps it is in
everyone's best interest

00:25.195 --> 00:27.445
that you and I find a way
past all of this.

00:27.447 --> 00:29.831
FLINT: There's simply no way
of stealing their gold.

00:29.866 --> 00:32.250
But there might be something else
you can steal... their war ship.

00:32.284 --> 00:34.419
DUFRESNE: You will both be
transported back to Nassau

00:34.454 --> 00:37.422
at which point you will be removed
from this ship permanently.

00:37.457 --> 00:40.125
SILVER: I think you intend to
take control of this ship.

00:40.177 --> 00:42.677
And then I think you intend
to return to that beach

00:42.713 --> 00:45.180
and seize every last ounce
of gold off of it.

00:45.215 --> 00:47.799
And I think you're going
to need my help to do it.

00:49.703 --> 00:51.936

02:30.987 --> 02:32.821
(Gasps)

02:47.387 --> 02:49.420
(Gasping)

03:01.101 --> 03:04.269
I learned of this technique
from a Spanish bishop.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.404
Six days, they claim,

03:06.439 --> 03:08.907
before the sun shrinks
the leather so tight

03:08.942 --> 03:12.277
that the ribs collapse,
piercing vital organs within.

03:13.864 --> 03:16.197
And on the seventh day,
you'll rest.

03:16.249 --> 03:19.951
Who knew?
They have a sense of humor.

03:25.008 --> 03:27.208
When my men first
pulled you out of the sea

03:27.260 --> 03:29.093
and brought you back
to this garrison,

03:29.129 --> 03:33.298
I knew right away you were going
to be of great value to me.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.134
You were ill-disposed
to acknowledge as much then,

03:36.186 --> 03:38.136
but five days later,

03:38.188 --> 03:40.138
I believe I have your attention.

03:40.140 --> 03:43.474
You see, I believe
I may have an opportunity

03:43.526 --> 03:45.476
to be liberated from this place.

03:45.528 --> 03:48.730
And you are going to help me.

03:59.993 --> 04:03.828
THOMAS: And God said,
"Let there be light,"

04:03.830 --> 04:06.247
and then there was light.

04:06.299 --> 04:09.167
And He saw that it was good,

04:09.219 --> 04:12.253
and He separated the land
from the water,

04:12.305 --> 04:15.006
and He called the water the Seas.

04:17.142 --> 04:21.228
And He said, "Let the sea
bring forth life abundantly."

04:22.849 --> 04:24.515
And He blessed it,

04:24.517 --> 04:26.184
and He said that it was good.

04:26.186 --> 04:28.102
(Men shouting)

04:31.024 --> 04:33.858
(Grunting)

04:35.528 --> 04:39.080
THOMAS: And He formed man
of the dust of the ground

04:39.115 --> 04:41.833
and breathed life into his nostrils

04:41.868 --> 04:44.669
and man became a living soul.

04:44.704 --> 04:47.372
And He beheld all He had created,

04:47.374 --> 04:49.507
and He said it was very good.

04:52.679 --> 04:57.015
But the Lord beheld the man
made in his likeness

04:57.050 --> 04:59.017
and He beheld his solitude...

05:00.353 --> 05:02.136
and He said,

05:02.188 --> 05:04.889
"It is not good that he is alone."

05:07.394 --> 05:09.861
- (Thunder rumbling)
- And the moral of the story...

05:12.198 --> 05:14.866
everybody needs a partner.

05:15.986 --> 05:17.902
You are the partner assigned to me

05:17.954 --> 05:21.039
in response to my father's request by
the Admiralty, but it would appear

05:21.074 --> 05:24.742
that even you believe this
endeavor is doomed to fail.

05:24.744 --> 05:27.211
Beg pardon, my lord,
but I didn't say that.

05:27.247 --> 05:30.415
I merely said that it would be wise
for us to manage our expectations

05:30.417 --> 05:32.333
as to what's achievable.

05:32.385 --> 05:34.635
And what is it that
you think is achievable?

05:34.671 --> 05:37.138
Well, sir, the pirate
issue is a thorny one,

05:37.173 --> 05:39.507
but I believe that
there are ways to...

05:39.559 --> 05:42.310
- Aside from the pirates.
- I'm sorry?

05:42.345 --> 05:45.396
I don't believe the pirates are
the cause of Nassau's problem.

05:45.432 --> 05:48.266
I believe they are a symptom.

05:48.268 --> 05:51.436
The root causes are the ones that
I would like to address first.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.271
Root causes?

05:53.273 --> 05:55.323
The graft of its governor.

05:55.358 --> 05:56.774
The incompetence of its managers.

05:56.826 --> 05:59.410
The neglect of its lords.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.446
The instability caused by these things

06:01.448 --> 06:03.998
is what draws the pirates to
Nassau, not the other way around.

06:04.034 --> 06:05.917
So let's begin there.

06:05.952 --> 06:08.453
What is it that you believe
would truly return Nassau

06:08.455 --> 06:09.954
to stable profitability?

06:10.006 --> 06:12.623
You mean aside from
removing the pirates?

06:12.675 --> 06:15.593
Let's leave them out for now, yes.

06:15.628 --> 06:17.962
What would it take?

06:19.966 --> 06:23.968
Farmers, men skilled in the
cultivation of sugar and tobacco.

06:24.020 --> 06:27.188
Magistrates to maintain order.
Carpenters to raise buildings.

06:27.223 --> 06:29.140
Clergy to raise spirits.

06:29.192 --> 06:32.643
Foodstuffs to sustain them all
for six months, perhaps a year.

06:32.645 --> 06:35.980
Three ships to transport it
all, sailors to sail them.

06:35.982 --> 06:37.865
And an honest governor,

06:37.901 --> 06:40.985
the first in recent memory,
to oversee it all.

06:40.987 --> 06:43.538
In short, you'd be
assembling a colony,

06:43.573 --> 06:46.407
boarding it onto ships, transporting
it across the Atlantic,

06:46.459 --> 06:49.127
and hoping that when it arrives,
it takes to an environment

06:49.162 --> 06:51.496
that has resisted every
attempt at stable commerce

06:51.498 --> 06:53.831
for the past 50 years.

06:53.883 --> 06:57.168
Oh, and then there are the pirates
that we've agreed not to discuss.

06:59.506 --> 07:02.173
Are you sure three ships
would be enough?

07:03.893 --> 07:07.562
My lord, I feel I have
to be honest with you.

07:07.597 --> 07:11.649
I have grave doubts about whether
something like this is realistic.

07:11.684 --> 07:13.935
- Yes, I've gathered that.
- If you wish to request

07:13.987 --> 07:17.355
a liaison more sympathetic
to your views,

07:17.407 --> 07:19.657
I'm sure Admiral Hennessey
would be happy to oblige.

07:19.692 --> 07:23.528
The New World is a gift, Lieutenant,

07:23.530 --> 07:28.166
a sacred opportunity to right
our wrongs and begin anew.

07:28.201 --> 07:30.918
And I do not want
my family's plot in it

07:30.954 --> 07:32.870
to be the reason for its fall.

07:37.544 --> 07:40.128
I'm not looking for
someone to hold my hand.

07:40.180 --> 07:42.213
I need someone who can help me

07:42.265 --> 07:44.882
ensure that Nassau survives.

07:44.934 --> 07:46.801
The stakes are too great
for anything else.

07:48.054 --> 07:49.637
And you suspect that I'm that person

07:49.689 --> 07:53.167
despite the fact that it's clear that
we both view the world very differently?

07:53.168 --> 07:54.798
Because of it.

07:54.799 --> 07:57.695
Strange pairs, Lieutenant.

07:57.730 --> 08:01.232
They can achieve
the most unexpected things.

08:13.913 --> 08:16.414
You can walk away
from all this if you wanted.

08:16.466 --> 08:19.300
The moment we arrive at Nassau,

08:19.335 --> 08:21.886
you're free to go anywhere you want.

08:21.921 --> 08:26.390
And yet you've offered
to help me regain control of this crew.

08:27.427 --> 08:29.810
Why would you do that?

08:32.065 --> 08:34.765
You mean aside from the share
of gold I'd get out of it?

08:37.102 --> 08:40.605
There are other ways of
earning money, other crews.

08:40.657 --> 08:43.691
I don't want to earn money.

08:43.743 --> 08:45.610
I don't want to join another crew.

08:45.612 --> 08:48.412
If we're being honest, I don't
really want to be on this crew

08:48.448 --> 08:50.948
a day longer than
is absolutely necessary.

08:50.950 --> 08:52.166
Why not?

08:52.202 --> 08:54.619
Because I don't want to be a pirate.

08:54.671 --> 08:56.954
I'm not interested in the life.

08:57.006 --> 08:58.873
Not interested in the fighting,

08:58.925 --> 09:01.008
not interested in the ships.

09:01.044 --> 09:04.295
I don't care much for the sea
while we're on the subject.

09:04.297 --> 09:06.047
But being a pirate on this crew

09:06.099 --> 09:07.798
for a little while longer,

09:07.800 --> 09:09.600
it offers me an opportunity

09:09.636 --> 09:13.304
I don't believe I can find
anywhere else on Earth...

09:13.306 --> 09:15.973
one big prize.

09:16.025 --> 09:18.109
And with it, freedom.

09:18.144 --> 09:20.645
From water, from Randall,

09:20.697 --> 09:24.115
from hunger, from wages...

09:25.485 --> 09:26.951
from you.

09:33.042 --> 09:34.625
Just one question.

09:36.629 --> 09:38.663
In approximately two days' time,

09:38.715 --> 09:40.748
when we arrive back at Nassau,

09:40.800 --> 09:43.884
you and I will both be unceremoniously
expelled from this ship.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.671
That would seem to be
an impediment to your plan.

09:49.926 --> 09:52.393
In less than two days,

09:52.428 --> 09:55.896
I intend to be a captain again.

09:55.932 --> 09:59.517
I suggest you find a way of earning
your way back onto this crew as well.

10:03.489 --> 10:05.406
(Chatter)

10:07.694 --> 10:09.694
(Men laughing)

10:13.166 --> 10:15.916
Captain, a word, please.

10:17.170 --> 10:19.954
Mr. Meeks, how can I help you?

10:25.678 --> 10:27.628
What happened at the tavern
last night, Captain?

10:27.680 --> 10:29.430
I don't know.
Did something happen?

10:29.465 --> 10:32.516
I've heard word you
confronted the Guthrie woman.

10:32.552 --> 10:34.935
- Threatened her?
- And?

10:34.971 --> 10:37.021
And I wish you hadn't done that.

10:37.056 --> 10:38.776
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Are we through?

10:38.808 --> 10:40.558
No, we're not.

10:40.610 --> 10:42.560
The crew's relationship with her

10:42.562 --> 10:44.478
is worth far more than
the amount she withheld

10:44.530 --> 10:46.314
from the Good Fortune prize.

10:46.366 --> 10:49.066
You're recklessly jeopardizing
that relationship,

10:49.068 --> 10:51.235
their relationship.

10:51.237 --> 10:52.870
Mr. Meeks, would you like to know

10:52.905 --> 10:54.705
what the men were laughing at
just now when you arrived?

10:54.741 --> 10:59.076
I was recounting to them
my conversation at the tavern last night

10:59.078 --> 11:01.078
and wondering aloud

11:01.080 --> 11:03.080
if I were to fuck the lady Guthrie

11:03.082 --> 11:05.549
to within an inch of her young
life while they watched,

11:05.585 --> 11:08.636
would the crew consider her
debt to them repaid in full?

11:08.671 --> 11:10.888
(Men laughing)

11:10.923 --> 11:12.757
And will they feel the same

11:12.759 --> 11:15.226
when their next haul
is rejected by her outright?

11:15.261 --> 11:16.977
When we return from Carolina,

11:17.013 --> 11:19.597
every man on this ship will
have his hat filled with gold.

11:19.599 --> 11:21.816
What happens after that?

11:21.851 --> 11:23.934
It's an uncertain world, Mr. Meeks.

11:23.986 --> 11:25.319
Best to live in the now.

11:52.298 --> 11:54.515
He took me in

11:54.550 --> 11:57.968
when I didn't have shit.

11:57.970 --> 11:59.603
Made a place for me.

11:59.639 --> 12:02.640
Taught me things.

12:02.692 --> 12:06.694
Without him, I wouldn't
have fucking made it.

12:09.315 --> 12:12.366
When someone gives you a life,

12:12.402 --> 12:14.285
it ain't truly your own.

12:16.739 --> 12:19.790
You owe some part of it back.

12:23.045 --> 12:26.163
What happened last night...

12:26.215 --> 12:27.965
Jesus.

12:31.304 --> 12:34.054
I understand.

12:34.090 --> 12:36.807
Something so different
from what you know.

12:36.843 --> 12:39.176
I know how frightening it can be.

12:43.816 --> 12:45.850
I will respect your wishes

12:45.852 --> 12:48.436
and we can make last night
the last time.

13:03.453 --> 13:07.254
Oh, fuck. There must be a way.

13:07.290 --> 13:09.206
A way to make me essential.

13:09.258 --> 13:12.343
They can hate me,
they just need to need me.

13:12.378 --> 13:14.678
Randall, hurry the fuck up.

13:14.714 --> 13:16.347
We're waiting.

13:19.218 --> 13:21.769
And don't you dare fucking
spit in my bowl, Randall.

13:21.804 --> 13:23.354
We all know you do it
when you're ornery,

13:23.389 --> 13:26.056
but I'm warning you, I'll know.

13:30.396 --> 13:31.812
Curs.

13:35.485 --> 13:37.401
You're gonna do it
anyway, aren't you?

13:37.403 --> 13:39.620
(Snorting)

13:43.125 --> 13:45.242
Randall, that is truly disgusting.

13:45.244 --> 13:48.746
Imbecile or no, you really
ought to know better.

13:48.748 --> 13:51.332
I don't like him.

13:51.384 --> 13:54.468
Be that as it may, it hardly justifies...

13:56.255 --> 13:57.755
What did you say?

13:57.757 --> 14:00.257
I don't like him.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.763
Yes.

14:05.815 --> 14:07.932
Perhaps the better question is,

14:07.934 --> 14:10.484
who else doesn't like him?

14:14.607 --> 14:16.440
- (Knocks on door)
- Yes?

14:19.278 --> 14:21.278
A moment, if I may?

14:23.115 --> 14:24.782
Of course.

14:26.285 --> 14:27.918
Have you read any of these?

14:29.505 --> 14:30.921
Excuse me?

14:32.875 --> 14:36.343
A shelf of books,
so many lives unled...

14:37.797 --> 14:40.381
so many possibilities.

14:40.433 --> 14:43.384
I glanced, but nothing rang familiar.

14:43.436 --> 14:46.220
Nor for me.

14:49.275 --> 14:51.141
You know the irony of all this?

14:51.143 --> 14:53.978
When we first found you,

14:54.030 --> 14:57.147
I was the one who saw
the promise in acquiring you

14:57.199 --> 14:59.483
and Mr. Gates was the one
who opposed it.

14:59.485 --> 15:01.869
Is that so?

15:01.904 --> 15:03.487
He didn't trust lettered men.

15:03.489 --> 15:06.240
Found them harder to keep in line,

15:06.292 --> 15:09.126
more resistant to persuasion.

15:09.161 --> 15:11.662
I prevailed.

15:11.714 --> 15:13.247
What was your argument?

15:14.584 --> 15:18.502
That I was tired of being the only one
he had a hard time keeping in line.

15:18.504 --> 15:20.504
(Chuckles)

15:24.727 --> 15:28.312
Mr. Flint, I'm sorry, but I have a
tremendous amount of preparations...

15:28.347 --> 15:30.147
It's killing me...

15:30.182 --> 15:31.649
what happened.

15:31.684 --> 15:35.102
What I did to Mr. Gates.

15:35.154 --> 15:38.656
I keep on replaying it in my mind

15:38.691 --> 15:40.658
every waking moment,

15:40.693 --> 15:43.027
trying to see another way.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.999
I don't expect you to understand,

15:49.035 --> 15:52.703
but I need you to know
that no one on this ship

15:52.705 --> 15:56.457
feels his loss more keenly than I do.

15:56.509 --> 16:00.711
I know he developed
a great affection for you.

16:03.099 --> 16:05.049
Perhaps if I can support you
in this moment,

16:05.101 --> 16:08.719
it will be some small
penance for what I've done.

16:08.721 --> 16:12.022
How exactly do you propose
to support me?

16:12.058 --> 16:14.058
By giving you good counsel.

16:18.564 --> 16:21.315
We're losing our favorable wind.

16:21.367 --> 16:23.651
Been losing it for hours.

16:23.703 --> 16:26.704
Now, sooner or later,
someone will suggest

16:26.739 --> 16:30.124
tacking east around the
coast, get ahead of the wind.

16:30.159 --> 16:32.743
Maneuvered properly, that would
be the fastest way home,

16:32.745 --> 16:35.379
but I suggest that you resist
that plan at all costs.

16:36.499 --> 16:37.665
Why?

16:37.717 --> 16:41.502
Because that route runs right through
the common passage out of Kingston.

16:41.554 --> 16:44.805
And the men will press to take
the first prize they sight.

16:50.012 --> 16:53.347
We're in possession of a war ship.

16:53.399 --> 16:55.649
Why would we shy away
from taking a prize?

16:55.685 --> 16:58.152
Because the men aren't ready.

16:58.187 --> 16:59.937
Not with the numbers they've lost.

16:59.989 --> 17:03.524
They're far too depleted to
fully man this ship in battle.

17:03.576 --> 17:05.358
You get them home safely,

17:05.411 --> 17:08.612
get them rested,
reinforce their numbers,

17:08.664 --> 17:12.031
and then take this ship
and do with it what you will.

17:24.797 --> 17:27.464
(Chatter)

17:31.353 --> 17:35.773
HENNESSEY: "A sacred opportunity
to right our wrongs."

17:35.808 --> 17:40.144
My God, do you know anyone in
the world who talks that way?

17:40.146 --> 17:41.979
I do now, sir.

17:41.981 --> 17:44.648
Is it possible he's fully mad?

17:44.650 --> 17:46.450
Half of Whitehall whispers it.

17:46.485 --> 17:49.570
He isn't mad. He's just...

17:49.622 --> 17:52.372
bright, determined, wealthy,

17:52.408 --> 17:53.874
all at the same time.

17:53.909 --> 17:55.325
Jesus. That's worse.

17:56.462 --> 17:58.912
(Chatter, laughter)

18:03.002 --> 18:04.551
You might like him, sir.

18:04.587 --> 18:09.339
Actually, I went to one
of those salons of his,

18:09.341 --> 18:13.060
the ones that half the Royal
Society attend but most deny.

18:13.095 --> 18:15.596
Most of those men are pretenders, sir,

18:15.648 --> 18:18.682
attracted to his ideas because
they make them feel like radicals.

18:18.734 --> 18:20.684
But Thomas...

18:20.686 --> 18:23.570
when he talks about
the need to rethink things,

18:23.606 --> 18:25.405
systemic things,

18:25.441 --> 18:27.991
I think he truly believes
what he's saying.

18:28.027 --> 18:31.161
And what's more, I'm afraid I might
believe a good deal of it as well.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.696
Thomas?

18:32.748 --> 18:35.365
I'm sorry, sir.

18:35.367 --> 18:39.453
He refuses to stand on ceremony,
insists on the familiar.

18:41.090 --> 18:43.090
I know what you're thinking,
but I assure you, sir,

18:43.125 --> 18:45.876
my judgment, as it relates
to this assignment,

18:45.878 --> 18:47.461
is still intact.

18:51.016 --> 18:53.050
Ship's business.

18:53.052 --> 18:55.469
I shall return. No, no.

18:58.023 --> 18:59.807
(Men laughing)

19:18.160 --> 19:20.460
Is there a problem?

19:20.496 --> 19:23.297
No problem. None whatsoever.

19:24.583 --> 19:25.966
Apologies.

19:26.001 --> 19:28.635
Perhaps it's my jealousy showing.

19:28.671 --> 19:30.754
Liaison to the Hamilton family,

19:30.806 --> 19:33.223
that's quite an appointment.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.259
Congratulations, sir.

19:36.762 --> 19:38.095
Thank you.

19:38.147 --> 19:40.147
I must say, I thought
myself quite qualified,

19:40.182 --> 19:42.266
but then I suppose perhaps

19:42.318 --> 19:45.936
for this particular assignment,
you were the better man.

19:45.988 --> 19:48.238
(Men chuckle)

19:53.946 --> 19:55.445
Of course, I can understand

19:55.497 --> 19:57.831
how it would be
of such importance to you.

19:57.867 --> 20:01.785
Someone of your station...
son of a carpenter's mate

20:01.787 --> 20:04.121
given a chance
to socialize with a lord.

20:04.173 --> 20:06.206
Hold that position for long enough

20:06.258 --> 20:09.509
and you might convince everyone you're
something more than you actually are.

20:09.545 --> 20:11.178
(Men chuckle)

20:11.213 --> 20:13.630
A gentleman, most civilized.

20:13.682 --> 20:15.515
(Chuckling)

20:15.551 --> 20:18.719
I imagine there is
no end to the benefits

20:18.771 --> 20:21.054
Thomas Hamilton's favor
could bestow upon you.

20:21.106 --> 20:24.308
Future employment, status...

20:24.360 --> 20:28.395
hell, I understand
if he likes you well enough,

20:28.447 --> 20:30.781
he may even let you fuck his wife.

20:30.816 --> 20:33.317
(Grunting)

20:40.042 --> 20:41.959
HENNESSEY:
Enough!

20:47.800 --> 20:50.884
If you are an officer in my fleet,

20:50.920 --> 20:53.470
I suggest you leave this place.

20:54.556 --> 20:56.173
Now!

21:08.988 --> 21:10.904
(Chatter)

21:15.861 --> 21:17.577
You can't blame the men.

21:17.613 --> 21:19.830
They'd suffered under
an awful stretch of captains.

21:19.865 --> 21:22.666
Weaklings, frauds, liars.

21:22.701 --> 21:25.953
Ned Low, whatever he is,
he's none of those things.

21:26.005 --> 21:27.788
The men saw him as an answer.

21:27.840 --> 21:31.041
But now I fear they cannot
see that by supporting him,

21:31.093 --> 21:33.043
they may be sowing the seeds
of their own destruction.

21:33.045 --> 21:35.929
Mr. Meeks, your men can't
possibly be that stupid.

21:35.965 --> 21:38.515
Are they unaware of the profits he
cost them with the Good Fortune prize?

21:38.550 --> 21:40.300
Or the future profits
he's costing them with me?

21:40.352 --> 21:44.388
Ma'am, I'm uncertain of my
footing on this subject.

21:44.390 --> 21:45.889
Suffice it to say,

21:45.891 --> 21:50.777
the Good Fortune yielded up
a unique item of great value.

21:50.813 --> 21:53.280
The men know where their next
distribution is coming from

21:53.315 --> 21:55.816
and it isn't you.

21:55.868 --> 21:57.451
Item? What kind of item?

21:57.486 --> 21:59.236
I really cannot say.

22:00.456 --> 22:02.572
Well, Mr. Meeks, I'm not exactly sure

22:02.624 --> 22:04.104
what it is you think I can do for you,

22:04.126 --> 22:06.910
- but I've got business...
- I hear you depose captains.

22:06.912 --> 22:10.080
- Excuse me?
- I'm told you have that power.

22:10.132 --> 22:12.049
I'm told you've done it before.

22:12.084 --> 22:13.967
That was a special case

22:14.003 --> 22:16.420
and something I nearly paid for
at the cost of my livelihood.

22:16.472 --> 22:18.922
Simply incompatible
with the role I play here now.

22:18.974 --> 22:21.641
He is a mad man.

22:21.677 --> 22:24.561
And he's fixed on you
as an object of his ire.

22:24.596 --> 22:27.514
I need your help.
My men need your help.

22:27.566 --> 22:32.019
But you have an interest in
seeing this resolved as well.

22:32.071 --> 22:33.737
(Knocks on door)

22:33.772 --> 22:35.605
Ma'am.

22:36.742 --> 22:38.775
I'm on my way.

22:38.827 --> 22:40.243
Wait for me in the bar.

22:40.279 --> 22:42.245
We'll continue this conversation.

22:46.118 --> 22:48.118
Apologies, gentlemen,
for keeping you waiting.

22:53.092 --> 22:56.710
I'm most eager to hear the results
of Captain Lawrence's journey.

22:59.965 --> 23:02.049
(Chickens clucking)

23:02.101 --> 23:06.019
- WOMAN: Thanks, love.
- RACKHAM: Treating yourself, I see.

23:07.139 --> 23:08.972
I'd say you're entitled.

23:08.974 --> 23:11.141
The work you've done
for my inn is commendable.

23:11.193 --> 23:15.028
And what good are the efforts
if they yield no spoils?

23:15.064 --> 23:17.981
- I don't know what you mean.
- Don't ya?

23:18.033 --> 23:21.451
Mademoiselle, what exactly is
happening between you and Anne?

23:21.487 --> 23:24.287
She wanted me out of the inn,
out on the streets.

23:24.323 --> 23:25.789
What would you have had me do?

23:25.824 --> 23:30.077
I couldn't say, but seducing
her was certainly...

23:30.129 --> 23:32.129
(French accent)
an interesting approach.

23:32.164 --> 23:33.830
Call it what you like,

23:33.832 --> 23:35.549
but yesterday she was enraged.

23:35.584 --> 23:37.717
And today she is not.

23:37.753 --> 23:39.169
That is not seduction,

23:39.221 --> 23:42.222
that is simply removing the
cause of her frustration.

23:42.257 --> 23:43.840
Please.

23:43.892 --> 23:47.227
She was frustrated because
you crossed Eleanor Guthrie.

23:47.262 --> 23:49.012
Do you really believe that?

23:49.014 --> 23:51.731
Has she not been behaving strangely

23:51.767 --> 23:53.683
for far longer than any of that?

23:53.685 --> 23:58.105
Were Mr. Hamund here, perhaps he
could testify on the subject.

23:59.942 --> 24:01.575
I beg your pardon,
but are you asking me

24:01.610 --> 24:04.111
to believe that Anne
killed eight men,

24:04.163 --> 24:06.580
risked her life, utterly
destroyed both our reputations,

24:06.615 --> 24:09.055
to say nothing of the damage done
to her relationship with me,

24:09.084 --> 24:11.501
to remove you from that tent,
and that she did it all

24:11.537 --> 24:14.371
because she secretly wants to fuck you?

24:18.927 --> 24:21.094
I see.

24:23.348 --> 24:25.432
I'll tell you what
that sounds like to me.

24:25.467 --> 24:28.635
It sounds like a crass attempt to drive
a wedge between my partner and I

24:28.687 --> 24:31.388
to achieve for yourself
a controlling influence

24:31.440 --> 24:32.973
over our little triumvirate.

24:33.025 --> 24:34.975
Perhaps I'll share
that feeling with Anne

24:35.027 --> 24:38.061
and let's just see how quickly she
turns that anger in your direction.

24:38.113 --> 24:41.226
- It won't work.
- No? Why?

24:41.227 --> 24:43.066
Because I believe
that somewhere, somehow,

24:43.118 --> 24:44.651
you have known she has wanted this...

24:44.703 --> 24:47.037
needed this for a very long time.

24:47.072 --> 24:49.122
I'm giving it to her.

24:49.158 --> 24:50.740
And now that she has it,

24:50.742 --> 24:53.577
it would be exceedingly
difficult for her to let it go.

24:53.579 --> 24:56.630
This upsets you.
This threatens you.

24:56.665 --> 24:58.548
I am sorry.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.834
There is nothing you can do about it.

25:15.100 --> 25:17.184
MAN:
Hoist up the sails!

25:20.439 --> 25:22.822
- No luck?
- DE GROOT: Ugly stretch.

25:22.858 --> 25:26.159
Goddamn wind just won't cooperate.

25:26.195 --> 25:30.113
If I were to suggest rather
than trying to tack southwest

25:30.165 --> 25:34.167
that we head east, hug the coast
to navigate around the weather,

25:34.203 --> 25:35.952
what would you say?

25:35.954 --> 25:38.205
(Chuckles)

25:38.257 --> 25:41.708
I would say either
somebody gave you that idea,

25:41.760 --> 25:44.044
somebody who's a hell of a sailor,

25:44.096 --> 25:45.512
or you've been holding back on me.

25:47.049 --> 25:48.632
Flint said to avoid it.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.433
Said when it was raised

25:50.469 --> 25:52.719
that we should resist
the temptation at all costs.

25:52.771 --> 25:55.305
Avoid the common passage
it would take us through

25:55.307 --> 25:57.140
and the temptation to hunt a prize.

25:57.142 --> 25:58.942
You spoke to Flint?

26:00.145 --> 26:02.028
He approached me.

26:02.064 --> 26:03.813
Why would he do that?

26:03.865 --> 26:07.117
Why attempt to scuttle the idea before
any of us have even arrived at it?

26:07.152 --> 26:09.653
Is it possible he still believes
he can take back his command?

26:09.655 --> 26:11.238
How?

26:11.290 --> 26:13.240
There isn't a man on the crew
that will even speak to him,

26:13.292 --> 26:15.458
much less support him.

26:15.494 --> 26:18.662
I don't know, but had he that notion,

26:18.714 --> 26:22.716
I imagine the idea of this crew
taking a prize under your command

26:22.751 --> 26:25.502
would be a terrifying prospect.

26:25.554 --> 26:27.721
I suppose the only question is,

26:27.756 --> 26:30.006
are you prepared to lead them?

26:33.095 --> 26:35.512
Set the course.

26:35.514 --> 26:38.098
(Chatter)

26:41.737 --> 26:43.320
It's better than nothing, isn't it?

26:51.947 --> 26:54.114
An account of goings-on.

26:54.166 --> 26:57.784
Volume the first
on this 13th day in June,

26:57.836 --> 27:02.038
1715, in the year of our Lord.

27:02.040 --> 27:04.291
The weather is fair.

27:04.343 --> 27:07.177
Fresh topsail gale,
north by northeast.

27:09.765 --> 27:11.214
First item...

27:13.885 --> 27:17.937
a certain member of this crew,
who shall remain nameless,

27:17.973 --> 27:21.024
was seen dozing
during the night watch.

27:21.059 --> 27:23.059
Another member of the same watch

27:23.111 --> 27:27.030
took the opportunity to take
three pieces from his pocket...

27:28.734 --> 27:30.533
Shut the fuck up.

27:30.569 --> 27:32.285
We're eating.

27:41.213 --> 27:43.163
(Coughing)

27:45.634 --> 27:47.250
What was that?

27:47.252 --> 27:49.636
I am convincing the crew

27:49.671 --> 27:51.588
to allow me to remain with them.

27:51.590 --> 27:53.256
As we discussed.

27:53.258 --> 27:54.724
Is that what you're doing?

27:56.511 --> 28:00.680
I spent three years at the
St. John's Home for Poor Orphan Boys.

28:00.732 --> 28:03.400
During that time, I knew a
boy named Solomon Little.

28:03.435 --> 28:05.101
Cleft palette, spotted face,

28:05.153 --> 28:09.155
and the most unfortunate set of ears
I have, to this day, ever seen.

28:09.191 --> 28:11.775
He should have been beaten to within
an inch of his life on a daily basis

28:11.777 --> 28:14.277
if the laws of nature applied.

28:14.279 --> 28:16.830
Yet no one ever laid a finger on him

28:16.865 --> 28:20.750
because even at that tender age,

28:20.786 --> 28:23.420
he knew...

28:23.455 --> 28:26.506
it isn't about getting them to like you,

28:26.541 --> 28:30.043
it's about reminding them how
much they dislike each other.

28:31.296 --> 28:34.631
He got up every morning,
made his address,

28:34.633 --> 28:37.100
and I'll be God damned if
there was a boy in that home

28:37.135 --> 28:38.885
who could've lasted a day without it.

28:41.690 --> 28:46.309
You do realize that those are
grown men out there, not boys.

28:46.361 --> 28:47.977
In my experience,

28:47.979 --> 28:51.147
when it comes to the thrill
of ridiculing one's peers,

28:51.149 --> 28:52.866
there's little difference.

29:01.910 --> 29:04.377
No one pays him any attention,

29:04.413 --> 29:07.297
so he sees everything.

29:07.332 --> 29:09.165
And he knows his fate and mine

29:09.217 --> 29:11.634
are more closely linked
than he'd care to admit.

29:11.670 --> 29:14.587
So he reports it all back to me.

29:14.639 --> 29:16.673
And there's plenty more
gossip in the well.

29:20.312 --> 29:23.229
Good luck with...

29:23.265 --> 29:24.981
whatever this is.

29:31.356 --> 29:33.857
80 barrels of molasses,

29:33.859 --> 29:35.942
65 units of rum.

29:38.280 --> 29:39.920
I can't believe this is
all we got for it.

29:39.948 --> 29:42.165
If I may, ma'am,
I consider it a triumph

29:42.200 --> 29:43.700
I made it back here at all.

29:43.752 --> 29:47.370
I was met with great
skepticism at every turn,

29:47.372 --> 29:49.839
from the merchant buyers
to the customs house...

29:49.875 --> 29:51.341
Your papers were
properly arranged.

29:51.376 --> 29:52.842
Your payoffs were
in the proper amounts.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.377
It was all in good order.

29:54.429 --> 29:55.962
All but your family's name, ma'am.

29:57.132 --> 29:59.015
It is no longer in good order,

29:59.050 --> 30:00.633
and everyone
in that harbor knew it.

30:00.685 --> 30:03.386
I was questioned for nigh
on three hours

30:03.388 --> 30:06.222
the minute the customs man
realized I was your agent.

30:06.274 --> 30:09.476
At a certain point, I had to
frighten him into believing

30:09.528 --> 30:13.279
there would be reprisals
against him personally

30:13.315 --> 30:15.365
if he were to arrest me.

30:15.400 --> 30:18.067
- By whom?
- I beg your pardon?

30:18.119 --> 30:23.039
By whom did you suggest there
would be reprisals against him?

30:23.074 --> 30:25.959
Did you use Mr. Frasier's name?

30:25.994 --> 30:28.411
Captain Naft's, then?

30:28.413 --> 30:32.131
I can understand how that would
strike fear in the heart of any man.

30:32.167 --> 30:35.168
- Charles, enough.
- Or did you use mine?

30:38.673 --> 30:40.473
You're welcome.

30:42.761 --> 30:45.395
(Chatter, laughter)

30:57.526 --> 31:00.910
How awkward this is.

31:00.946 --> 31:03.780
Mr. Holmes here informed me

31:03.832 --> 31:06.115
that he observed you in this place

31:06.167 --> 31:08.201
nervously entering
Eleanor Guthrie's office.

31:08.253 --> 31:12.956
I told myself, "What on Earth could
Mr. Meeks have to say to her?"

31:13.008 --> 31:16.843
Now forced to wonder if it stems
from your concerns about my fitness.

31:16.878 --> 31:20.380
Seeking an ally, perhaps, to
threaten my position as captain.

31:22.634 --> 31:25.268
I swore an oath to those men.

31:25.303 --> 31:28.271
To protect them from their captain.

31:29.524 --> 31:32.108
From themselves when called for.

31:33.228 --> 31:35.311
I see.

31:35.313 --> 31:37.697
But perhaps you're right.

31:37.732 --> 31:41.534
Perhaps you serve their interests
best by betraying me in this moment.

31:41.570 --> 31:45.238
Although, perhaps this is just
the act of a spineless traitor,

31:45.290 --> 31:47.323
in which case...

31:47.375 --> 31:50.243
well, in which case...

31:52.581 --> 31:54.831
I have a duty to do
something about it.

32:00.338 --> 32:03.840
- You need to walk away from this.
- Walk away?

32:03.892 --> 32:05.425
This venture is on shaky footing.

32:05.477 --> 32:08.094
How long before
the street realizes this?

32:08.146 --> 32:10.346
How long before the mob
is outside your door again?

32:10.348 --> 32:13.182
What happens if this time
it won't go away?

32:13.184 --> 32:15.685
Since when have you been
concerned with my operation?

32:15.737 --> 32:17.854
My concern is for you.

32:17.906 --> 32:20.273
(Scoffs)

32:22.911 --> 32:24.611
I believe this is going to work.

32:24.663 --> 32:27.497
I believe you have motive
to see it fail.

32:27.532 --> 32:29.449
I believe you're angry with me.

32:29.501 --> 32:31.284
I believe you resent me.

32:31.336 --> 32:33.419
What I do not believe...

32:33.455 --> 32:35.622
not at all, not for an instant...

32:35.674 --> 32:37.256
is that you have any concern for me.

32:37.292 --> 32:38.875
I can't protect you from this.

32:40.345 --> 32:43.179
My men follow me because
I serve their interests first.

32:43.214 --> 32:45.765
To ask them to protect a tyrant

32:45.800 --> 32:47.850
too weak to enforce
her own tyranny...

32:47.886 --> 32:50.386
I will have a very hard
time convincing them

32:50.438 --> 32:52.889
that that is in their interests.

32:52.891 --> 32:56.442
If you are not strong enough
to protect yourself, Eleanor,

32:56.478 --> 32:59.896
then I am urging you to cease
behaving as if you are.

32:59.948 --> 33:03.066
- (Banging)
- (Men yelling)

33:05.820 --> 33:07.737
(Man screaming)

33:12.043 --> 33:14.293
(Gagging)

33:46.194 --> 33:48.161
I don't want to see you
in my place again.

33:48.196 --> 33:50.329
I don't want to see
you on my island again.

33:50.365 --> 33:53.282
Take your men, take your shit,

33:53.334 --> 33:55.084
and seek life elsewhere.

34:07.098 --> 34:10.132
I'd appreciate it if you'd remove
that from my face, friend.

34:10.185 --> 34:13.553
Did you not hear the lady, friend?

34:15.356 --> 34:16.938
All right.

34:23.148 --> 34:25.197
(Grunting)

35:04.689 --> 35:06.489
Don't.

35:34.385 --> 35:38.054
I'm sorry we've had such a
rough go of it, you and I...

35:38.106 --> 35:41.474
but I'm afraid I'm simply
enjoying myself

35:41.526 --> 35:43.943
way too much to consider
leaving this place.

35:50.819 --> 35:53.202
I'm sure we'll be seeing
each other soon.

36:18.563 --> 36:20.646
If you're trying to impress me,

36:20.682 --> 36:22.598
it isn't working.

36:24.769 --> 36:26.519
(Sighs)

36:31.609 --> 36:35.077
Goings-on, volume the fourth.

36:37.165 --> 36:39.782
Light breeze, west-southwest.

36:39.834 --> 36:42.952
Sunset in roughly three hours.

36:42.954 --> 36:45.288
First item...

36:46.925 --> 36:49.091
a certain member
of the rigging crew,

36:49.127 --> 36:51.127
who shall remain nameless,

36:51.179 --> 36:54.130
was moving his bowels
over the side.

36:54.182 --> 36:56.465
He was spotted considering the stick

36:56.467 --> 36:58.968
and its unacceptable state of being,

36:59.020 --> 37:01.520
and instead, chose to wipe

37:01.556 --> 37:03.973
with the bare palm of his hand.

37:03.975 --> 37:06.359
(Men laughing, cheering)

37:06.394 --> 37:10.313
(Clapping)

37:10.365 --> 37:12.315
(Groaning)

37:22.210 --> 37:24.660
- Next item...
- (Foot bangs)

37:26.998 --> 37:29.548
Oh...

37:29.584 --> 37:31.968
A member of the third watch,

37:32.003 --> 37:34.637
who shall remain nameless,

37:34.672 --> 37:36.672
entered the pen late last night

37:36.724 --> 37:38.841
sometime after three bells.

37:38.893 --> 37:42.228
Though no one actually
saw him enter or exit,

37:42.263 --> 37:45.064
evidence of his presence was clear,

37:45.099 --> 37:47.183
as upon inspection,

37:47.185 --> 37:51.520
the dairy goat's anus
was irritated from overuse.

37:58.947 --> 38:00.696
You fucked the dairy goat?

38:07.255 --> 38:09.422
(Men cheering)

38:09.457 --> 38:11.924
The dairy goat?

38:11.960 --> 38:15.011
They know who fucked the dairy goat.

38:17.048 --> 38:20.383
MAN:
There you go, Joshua!

38:22.387 --> 38:25.638
- MAN #2: Sail!
- MAN #3: Starboard bow!

38:25.690 --> 38:26.939
(Bell ringing)

38:26.975 --> 38:30.609
- Sail!
- Starboard bow!

38:30.645 --> 38:32.361
There!

38:36.067 --> 38:37.733
MAN:
Steady.

38:37.735 --> 38:40.319
Steer steady, keep your course.

38:40.371 --> 38:43.239
- What is she?
- English colors.

38:43.291 --> 38:46.542
Inbound from Kingston.
Sugar merchants, most likely.

38:52.967 --> 38:55.835
How do you presume an English
merchantmen will react

38:55.887 --> 38:57.720
when being hailed
by a Spanish warship?

38:59.173 --> 39:00.890
Only one way to find out.

39:04.595 --> 39:06.429
Anyone up for a little hunting?

39:06.481 --> 39:09.098
(Cheering)

39:39.380 --> 39:41.964
I'm sorry, you were saying something

39:41.966 --> 39:45.434
about your judgment on this matter

39:45.470 --> 39:47.053
remaining intact.

39:48.639 --> 39:51.107
I apologize, sir.

39:51.142 --> 39:53.642
Good sense escaped me for a moment.

39:53.644 --> 39:56.896
An insult to the man's wife
that had to be answered.

39:56.948 --> 40:00.116
It reflects not upon my fitness

40:00.151 --> 40:02.735
to continue handling Lord Hamilton.

40:02.787 --> 40:05.071
I know how important this posting is.

40:05.123 --> 40:07.289
I know you know.

40:07.325 --> 40:10.042
My concern with you

40:10.078 --> 40:13.829
is over that which cannot be known.

40:13.881 --> 40:17.249
That thing which arises in you

40:17.301 --> 40:19.969
when passions are aroused...

40:20.004 --> 40:22.338
good sense escapes you.

40:24.008 --> 40:25.925
All men have it.

40:25.977 --> 40:29.929
But yours... yours is different.

40:29.981 --> 40:33.065
Darker. Wilder.

40:33.101 --> 40:36.902
I imagine it's what makes you
so effective as an officer.

40:36.938 --> 40:39.522
But when exposed to extremes,

40:39.574 --> 40:43.159
I could not imagine
what it is capable of.

40:43.194 --> 40:46.612
And of greater concern,

40:46.664 --> 40:48.781
I'm not sure you do either.

40:59.177 --> 41:00.793
- MAN: Lift!
- (Grunting)

41:03.214 --> 41:06.215
Raise the lateen.

41:06.217 --> 41:08.184
Pull away!

41:08.219 --> 41:13.722
(Men chanting)
Heave!

41:13.774 --> 41:15.224
DE GROOT:
Pull away, God damn it!

41:15.276 --> 41:18.644
MAN:
Pull away, you lubbers!

41:18.696 --> 41:20.229
MEN:
Heave!

41:20.281 --> 41:22.448
- Come down.
- Aye, sir.

41:24.702 --> 41:26.402
DE GROOT:
Harnin' the port sheets.

41:26.454 --> 41:29.038
MAN:
Harnin' the port sheets!

41:31.975 --> 41:33.576
(Overlapping voices)
Take your pistols.

41:33.578 --> 41:38.214
- Ready the grappling.
- Keep it dry.

41:38.249 --> 41:42.718
- (Man shouting)
- Stand to, lads!

41:42.753 --> 41:45.337
(Groans)

41:45.389 --> 41:48.090
I don't need to explain to you
the stakes of what happens

41:48.142 --> 41:51.393
if Mr. Dufresne is successful
in taking this prize.

41:51.429 --> 41:53.929
MAN:
Keep the mainsail tight!

41:53.981 --> 41:56.932
FLINT: Took me a while to get
a feel for this part of it.

41:56.934 --> 41:59.768
Raise the black too soon
and the prize will run.

41:59.770 --> 42:01.770
Raise it too late

42:01.822 --> 42:05.357
and you'll induce panic and a
greater chance of resistance.

42:05.409 --> 42:08.577
You ought to show your colors
at just the right moment

42:08.613 --> 42:10.196
to get them to strike theirs.

42:23.544 --> 42:24.960
Raise the black.

42:25.012 --> 42:27.463
(Whistles)
Raise the black!

42:27.465 --> 42:30.049
MAN:
Raise the black!

42:46.234 --> 42:48.117
Gun crews at the ready.

42:48.152 --> 42:50.319
(Shouting)

42:53.708 --> 42:56.125
Hold your breath, lads.

43:04.135 --> 43:05.634
MAN:
They struck their colors.

43:05.670 --> 43:07.670
(Men cheering)

43:09.507 --> 43:11.590
See? I told you.

43:15.346 --> 43:17.813
- Prepare to board.
- Aye.

43:44.375 --> 43:46.959
(Footsteps approaching)

43:58.522 --> 44:00.055
You're in command here, yes?

44:00.107 --> 44:02.725
I am.

44:02.727 --> 44:04.943
You were wise not to fight.

44:04.979 --> 44:07.396
Are there any men
lying in wait below?

44:08.482 --> 44:09.865
Answer truthfully

44:09.900 --> 44:13.035
or the consequences will be severe.

44:15.706 --> 44:17.906
It is as you see it.

44:21.078 --> 44:23.829
Sweep the hold.
Start at the bow.

44:29.754 --> 44:32.004
This is the most dangerous part.

44:33.724 --> 44:35.841
Look at him.

44:35.893 --> 44:38.594
His mind is drowning in questions.

44:38.646 --> 44:41.430
Did I make the right decision?

44:41.482 --> 44:43.599
How am I going to explain
to my proprietors

44:43.651 --> 44:45.818
that I gave up their goods
without a fight?

44:45.853 --> 44:47.686
What kind of man am I?

44:47.738 --> 44:51.273
You hope he has answers
to those questions.

44:51.275 --> 44:56.445
You hope that he can reassure himself
that he made the right decision.

44:56.497 --> 44:58.580
You hope that he doesn't realize

44:58.616 --> 45:01.166
that the thing that he thought
he was surrendering to...

45:01.202 --> 45:04.169
the thing that drove fear
into his heart

45:04.205 --> 45:07.256
the moment he saw the black...

45:07.291 --> 45:10.459
that that thing
is nowhere to be found.

45:16.967 --> 45:19.134
Are you him?

45:25.059 --> 45:29.061
- Beg your pardon?
- I said are you him? Are you Captain Flint?

45:38.489 --> 45:40.572
I assure you, sir,

45:40.624 --> 45:42.541
you do not want to test us.

45:46.130 --> 45:48.914
FLINT:
Men in these waters are hard men.

45:48.966 --> 45:52.501
They don't fear ships.
They don't fear guns.

45:52.553 --> 45:54.420
They don't fear swords.

45:56.173 --> 45:58.006
Then what do they fear?

46:07.151 --> 46:09.351
(Whistles)

46:09.403 --> 46:11.437
(Shouting)

46:14.525 --> 46:16.191
(Grunting)

46:17.278 --> 46:18.410
(Gunshots)

46:29.206 --> 46:32.007
- MAN: Retreat!
- MAN #2: Back to the ship!

46:32.042 --> 46:33.208
(Gunfire)

46:36.597 --> 46:39.548
(Men yelling)

46:41.552 --> 46:43.872
I want muskets in the rigging
to suppress their front line.

46:43.888 --> 46:45.387
Mr. Dufresne, we have lost the day.

46:45.439 --> 46:47.890
(Shouting and gunshots continue)

46:47.942 --> 46:49.224
MAN:
Muskets!

46:51.028 --> 46:52.361
We must disengage.

46:52.396 --> 46:53.979
What are we waiting for?
Why aren't we moving?

46:54.031 --> 46:55.898
Give the order, Mr. Dufresne.

46:55.900 --> 46:58.116
We do not have the manpower
to retake that ship.

46:58.152 --> 47:00.452
- We must get underway.
- Why the fuck are we waiting for him?

47:00.488 --> 47:02.955
- Because he's in charge here.
- No one is in fucking charge here!

47:02.990 --> 47:05.073
FLINT:
You have to sink her.

47:05.125 --> 47:08.710
You cannot just escape,
you have to sink that ship.

47:08.712 --> 47:10.913
For if a single one of those
men lives to tell the tale,

47:10.915 --> 47:14.583
no one will ever surrender
before that flag again.

47:14.635 --> 47:16.418
(Man screams)

47:21.475 --> 47:23.258
Cut us loose. Get us underway.

47:23.310 --> 47:26.645
Cut us loose! Get us underway!

47:26.680 --> 47:30.432
- MAN: Set sail.
- MAN #2: Cut the line! Cut the line!

47:35.272 --> 47:37.105
Gun crews at the ready.

47:37.157 --> 47:40.108
(Gunfire)

47:41.278 --> 47:43.278
Gun crews at the ready.

47:43.280 --> 47:45.948
(Men shouting)

47:45.950 --> 47:50.118
- Two-six! Two-six!
- Heave! Heave!

47:52.957 --> 47:57.509
- Two-six! Two-six!
- Heave! Heave!

47:57.545 --> 47:59.211
- Two-six!
- Heave!

47:59.263 --> 48:01.346
Fire!

48:01.382 --> 48:03.632
- Fire!
- Fire!

48:03.634 --> 48:05.968
(Screaming)

48:16.564 --> 48:18.480
(Cannon fire continues)

48:56.570 --> 48:59.404
I don't see a move
I can make from here.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.523
If I move against him directly,

49:01.525 --> 49:04.109
his men retaliate and I don't
have the muscle to withstand it.

49:04.161 --> 49:06.912
And even if I could muster up
that kind of support,

49:06.947 --> 49:09.364
I couldn't get away with it.

49:13.087 --> 49:15.954
Not after such a public
display of loss as today.

49:18.042 --> 49:20.425
Not so brazenly.

49:20.461 --> 49:23.762
The consortium is fragile.
It would be toppled.

49:23.797 --> 49:26.682
And I'm simply not willing
to allow that to happen.

49:26.717 --> 49:29.635
And I suspect it's only a matter of time

49:29.687 --> 49:31.687
before he makes a move against me.

49:40.698 --> 49:43.198
You want me to believe that
you have some concern for me?

49:44.568 --> 49:45.901
Then show it.

49:49.123 --> 49:52.658
If you need something
to induce your men into action,

49:52.710 --> 49:55.627
I know his crew hold an asset
from their last prize

49:55.663 --> 49:57.996
that they deem of great value.

49:58.048 --> 50:00.882
- What asset?
- I don't know.

50:06.390 --> 50:08.223
I don't know.

50:38.005 --> 50:41.373
(Door opens, closes)

50:45.796 --> 50:47.763
(Crickets chirping)

51:06.784 --> 51:09.701
(Gasping)

51:27.337 --> 51:29.504
RACKHAM:
What I have found in my experience

51:29.556 --> 51:31.890
is the more elusive the puzzle,

51:31.925 --> 51:35.393
the more painfully obvious
its ultimate solution.

51:35.429 --> 51:37.679
One just has to be willing to see it.

51:37.731 --> 51:42.601
Take our predicament, for example.

51:42.653 --> 51:44.519
You have a wealth of leads,

51:44.571 --> 51:47.522
but no means of exploiting them
for anything other than a fee

51:47.524 --> 51:51.026
and risking retaliation from
Ms. Guthrie in the process.

51:51.028 --> 51:52.944
I, on the other hand,

51:52.996 --> 51:56.114
have an unparalleled aptitude
for the management of a crew,

51:56.166 --> 51:59.584
but am denied any and every
opportunity to exploit the skill.

51:59.620 --> 52:03.004
And there it is...
the solution, so obvious.

52:03.040 --> 52:05.957
You will provide all leads

52:06.009 --> 52:07.542
derived from this place
directly to me.

52:07.594 --> 52:09.544
I will judge which to prosecute

52:09.546 --> 52:12.297
and which too likely to rouse
Ms. Guthrie's ire.

52:12.349 --> 52:14.549
Anne and I will then
take those chosen leads,

52:14.551 --> 52:16.384
we'll procure a ship,
we'll recruit men,

52:16.436 --> 52:19.054
and we'll create,
from nothing, a new crew

52:19.056 --> 52:21.973
from which we three
will each hold a share.

52:27.981 --> 52:30.315
You asked for better captains...

52:30.367 --> 52:32.400
I give you Captain Jack Rackham.

52:37.741 --> 52:40.292
And one more thing...

52:40.327 --> 52:44.045
darling, I can understand why you
wouldn't want to tell me about this,

52:44.081 --> 52:48.049
but please know that all I have
ever wanted for you is to be happy.

52:51.922 --> 52:53.922
Come to bed when you're through.

53:13.327 --> 53:16.111
Was it close?

53:16.113 --> 53:17.612
The vote.

53:19.666 --> 53:21.166
It was.

53:24.171 --> 53:26.288
I suppose you warned me...

53:28.508 --> 53:30.292
didn't you?

53:31.879 --> 53:34.546
To avoid that course
through the shipping lanes.

53:36.133 --> 53:40.685
Perhaps it was my hubris
that drove me to it.

53:40.721 --> 53:44.639
To show you I had it in me to lead.

53:46.810 --> 53:50.312
But as I sit here,

53:50.314 --> 53:53.732
I'm forced to consider
another possibility.

53:55.953 --> 53:57.869
That course we charted...

54:00.324 --> 54:05.493
perhaps none of us would
have thought of it at all

54:05.495 --> 54:08.330
had you not raised it
in the first place.

54:10.250 --> 54:12.167
That you orchestrated it all.

54:15.005 --> 54:17.722
The deaths,

54:17.758 --> 54:21.226
the destruction,

54:21.261 --> 54:22.844
the loss.

54:25.983 --> 54:28.683
All to achieve this very moment.

54:31.989 --> 54:34.439
Is it possible a man
could do such a thing?

54:59.549 --> 55:01.466
Congratulations, Captain.

55:06.857 --> 55:08.773
(Door closes)
