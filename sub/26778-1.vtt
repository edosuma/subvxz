01:13.551 --> 01:15.067
Hey, Joy!

01:16.437 --> 01:17.369
Ready?

01:17.404 --> 01:18.537
You bet.

01:18.572 --> 01:23.108
Let's go knock the socks
off Weatherton's.

01:23.144 --> 01:26.311
Okay, we are coming to the end
of our time as a focus group,

01:26.347 --> 01:28.113
but I just want to pose
one last question.

01:28.149 --> 01:30.783
Since you're all
shoppers of Weatherton's,

01:30.818 --> 01:32.451
how would you sum up
your experience?

01:34.688 --> 01:37.022
I love it,
especially at Christmas.

01:37.057 --> 01:39.057
Yes, I just love
the Weatherton's store.

01:39.093 --> 01:40.692
<i>They do such a wonderful job</i>

01:40.728 --> 01:42.995
<i>of making it feel warm
and welcoming.</i>

01:43.030 --> 01:44.863
<i>But classy, too.</i>

01:44.899 --> 01:46.331
<i>You know
you're getting the best.</i>

01:46.367 --> 01:47.800
<i>Well, that's wonderful to hear.</i>

01:47.835 --> 01:49.368
<i>That's very valuable.</i>

01:49.436 --> 01:51.476
<i>Now, how would you say
the Weatherton's experience</i>

01:51.505 --> 01:54.573
<i>is different from other stores?</i>

01:54.608 --> 01:57.442
<i>It's one of the stores
I make a point of going into.</i>

01:57.478 --> 01:59.211
<i>You can't really know
if something's right</i>

01:59.246 --> 02:00.579
unless you see yourself in it.

02:04.552 --> 02:07.986
I still prefer
to do my Christmas shopping online,

02:08.021 --> 02:09.988
but I'll come in
for the hot cocoa bar.

02:10.024 --> 02:12.357
That does seem to be
quite popular.

02:12.426 --> 02:15.727
<i>Okay, I think that about covers it.
Thank you so much for your time.</i>

02:15.763 --> 02:18.964
- Where's your research director?
- Margie Carter?

02:19.033 --> 02:21.567
She couldn't make it this time.

02:21.602 --> 02:23.268
Or last time
either, as I recall.

02:26.006 --> 02:28.507
Joy is very good at this.

02:28.542 --> 02:31.176
They're ready for you upstairs,
Mrs. Weatherton.

02:38.319 --> 02:39.151
Mrs. Weatherton?

02:39.220 --> 02:42.721
- Had to go to a meeting.
- Probably for the best.

02:42.756 --> 02:44.234
Margie doesn't like it
when we talk to the clients.

02:44.258 --> 02:47.359
- Mrs. Weatherton mentioned you.
- Me? Specifically?

02:47.394 --> 02:49.339
She thought you were doing
a good job with the focus group.

02:49.363 --> 02:51.530
Well, I should be,
I've done enough to last a lifetime.

02:51.565 --> 02:53.065
Not for much longer.

02:53.133 --> 02:54.733
That's not guaranteed.

02:54.802 --> 02:56.935
You've been working 24/7
since I've known you.

02:56.971 --> 02:58.481
They're going to announce
your promotion

02:58.505 --> 03:00.405
at the Christmas Gala,
and you know it.

03:00.441 --> 03:01.506
We'll see.

03:01.575 --> 03:03.909
- Do you have your dress yet?
- For The Gala?

03:03.944 --> 03:04.910
Who's had time to shop?

03:04.945 --> 03:05.878
Why? Do you?

03:05.913 --> 03:09.548
No, but it just so happens,
we did a focus group

03:09.583 --> 03:12.985
at a legendary
department store, so...

03:20.127 --> 03:21.660
I love shopping at Weatherton's.

03:32.006 --> 03:33.105
So cute.

03:33.173 --> 03:34.539
I know...

03:52.059 --> 03:54.359
That is pretty.

03:54.395 --> 03:56.895
It's just like the dress
I was thinking of for the Gala.

03:56.931 --> 03:58.664
My mom gave me
a Christmas ornament once

03:58.699 --> 04:00.232
that was exactly this color.

04:03.237 --> 04:05.637
It looks very expensive.

04:05.673 --> 04:08.907
But this is my dress.

04:08.943 --> 04:11.410
That's one of
my favorites this year.

04:11.445 --> 04:12.377
Mrs. Weatherton!

04:12.413 --> 04:15.113
Hello, Joy.
Renee.

04:15.149 --> 04:17.616
Good to see you're a shopper
at Weatherton's as well.

04:17.685 --> 04:19.017
Of course.

04:20.821 --> 04:21.887
So, about earlier,

04:21.922 --> 04:23.442
how did you think
the focus group went?

04:24.491 --> 04:27.793
As you know,
we have to read the transcripts

04:27.828 --> 04:28.760
and write up the report...

04:28.796 --> 04:30.529
Yes, I do know all that.

04:30.597 --> 04:33.432
I've been a MacDonald-Webber
client for many years.

04:34.601 --> 04:36.001
But I want to know
what you think.

04:36.070 --> 04:37.536
Gut instinct.

04:37.571 --> 04:38.770
How did they respond

04:38.806 --> 04:42.007
to shopping here
at Weatherton's, in store?

04:45.412 --> 04:46.478
Very positive.

04:47.881 --> 04:50.515
People love your store,
especially this time of year.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.684
I remember once
when I was a little girl,

04:52.720 --> 04:54.164
my mom drove four hours
out of the way

04:54.188 --> 04:56.421
to bring me
Christmas shopping here.

04:56.457 --> 04:58.557
It's one of
my favorite memories.

04:58.592 --> 05:02.094
You can't recreate that on a website,
no matter how hard you try.

05:04.598 --> 05:10.569
This particular shade of green
will look perfect on you.

05:12.339 --> 05:14.640
- Is the car ready?
- Yes, Mrs. Weatherton...

05:20.114 --> 05:21.713
You shouldn't
have said anything.

05:23.584 --> 05:26.830
- I know, Margie, I'm sorry...
- I know, she put you on the spot.

05:26.854 --> 05:27.953
What's going on?

05:28.022 --> 05:30.022
It's not like her to be so...
insistent.

05:30.057 --> 05:32.090
Poppy Weatherton is considering

05:32.159 --> 05:34.893
expanding Weatherton's
outside of the D.C. area.

05:34.962 --> 05:37.863
- That's a good idea...
- Not good idea.

05:37.898 --> 05:40.866
Cyber shopping is the arc
of the future, not stores.

05:41.235 --> 05:42.603
All of our research shows that.

05:42.671 --> 05:45.298
But Weatherton's
isn't like most other stores.

05:45.496 --> 05:47.083
People actually like
going there.

05:47.107 --> 05:49.608
I realize your mother took you
there when you were little,

05:49.677 --> 05:51.076
and it's a very sweet story,

05:51.145 --> 05:52.411
but completely incidental

05:52.479 --> 05:54.880
to the MacDonald-Webber
overall assessment.

05:54.949 --> 05:57.549
- We deal in data, Joy.
- I know.

05:57.618 --> 06:00.185
Just make sure that our
reports reflect those facts,

06:00.254 --> 06:02.956
...not your personal sentiment.
Understand?

06:15.770 --> 06:17.403
<i>Happy holidays, Crystal Falls.</i>

06:17.438 --> 06:19.505
<i>It's a beautiful
North Carolina morning</i>

06:19.540 --> 06:21.473
<i>and to celebrate
the Christmas season,</i>

06:21.509 --> 06:23.976
<i>tune in as we keep an eye
on the temperatures,</i>

06:24.011 --> 06:24.777
<i>we may be getting a white
Christmas, but...</i>

06:24.812 --> 06:26.245
Hey!

06:26.280 --> 06:28.320
<i>...But tune in later,
we'll tell you all about it.</i>

06:39.327 --> 06:40.225
Good morning, Ben.

06:40.261 --> 06:41.360
Good morning.

06:41.395 --> 06:43.862
Be sure they save some of that
for me to do later.

06:43.898 --> 06:45.342
You never get enough
Christmas, do you?

06:45.366 --> 06:46.366
Never.

06:50.438 --> 06:52.071
Aunt Ruby...

06:52.106 --> 06:53.172
Merry Christmas.

07:30.211 --> 07:32.778
Five times lucky
in the Cookie Crawl, Ben.

07:32.813 --> 07:35.180
Let's do it again.

08:18.659 --> 08:21.860
Here are the bids for the top three
medical records service companies.

08:21.929 --> 08:23.095
Thanks.

08:23.130 --> 08:25.497
And where are we
with your temp replacement?

08:25.566 --> 08:28.600
Karen's ready to go
as soon as this lil' guy is.

08:28.636 --> 08:30.302
Which is after Christmas, right?

08:30.371 --> 08:33.871
Well, we're in that final
two-week window, so... maybe?

08:35.676 --> 08:38.178
You were totally thinking
about your mom

08:38.212 --> 08:39.678
and the gingerbread contest.

08:39.714 --> 08:42.313
- Does that make me a bad boss?
- No.

08:42.349 --> 08:43.948
No, but what's done is done.

08:43.984 --> 08:48.854
It's your turn to participate.
Your mom is counting on you.

08:48.889 --> 08:49.922
The entries are complete,

08:49.957 --> 08:52.135
the decorating team has been
picked and knows what to do.

08:52.159 --> 08:55.272
Relax, you have a judge
other than yourself this year.

08:55.296 --> 08:57.563
But you have to be
at the contest.

08:57.598 --> 08:59.665
I'm gonna do my best,

08:59.700 --> 09:01.734
but I'm not the only one
with a say in this matter.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.669
I know, and...

09:03.704 --> 09:05.137
if I have to take over

09:05.172 --> 09:07.773
judging responsibilities
myself again, I will.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.141
I'm sure Mom will understand.

09:10.911 --> 09:12.578
No, she won't.

09:19.553 --> 09:20.753
You're the best!

09:20.788 --> 09:21.854
Thank you so much.

09:21.889 --> 09:23.133
Hey, how'd it go yesterday
with Margie?

09:23.157 --> 09:24.690
I don't know why

09:24.725 --> 09:26.625
I kept blabbering on
about Poppy Weatherton.

09:28.529 --> 09:29.862
Sorry.

09:33.734 --> 09:34.800
Hello?

09:34.835 --> 09:35.934
Joy?

09:35.970 --> 09:37.870
Joy, hi! It's...
It's Shirley Andrews.

09:37.905 --> 09:38.971
<i>Mrs. Andrews, hi!</i>

09:39.039 --> 09:39.972
How are you?

09:40.040 --> 09:43.108
I'm fine, I'm good, but,
I'm afraid your aunt isn't.

09:43.177 --> 09:44.543
What's wrong?

09:44.578 --> 09:45.978
<i>Well...</i>

09:46.013 --> 09:48.492
she was reaching for some supplies
for the Cookie Crawl, and she...

09:48.516 --> 09:49.659
she slipped and broke her ankle.

09:49.683 --> 09:51.818
Well, is she okay?
Can I talk to her?

09:51.852 --> 09:54.064
No, no, I'm just home
getting a few things,

09:54.088 --> 09:56.333
but I want to get back to the
hospital before her surgery.

09:56.357 --> 09:57.756
Surgery?

09:57.792 --> 09:59.436
<i>Look, I don't want you
to worry about this, Joy,</i>

09:59.460 --> 10:01.126
<i>she's gonna be fine.</i>

10:01.162 --> 10:03.195
<i>She told me she didn't
want me to call you</i>

10:03.230 --> 10:04.129
<i>and worry you, but...</i>

10:04.198 --> 10:06.999
but I figured you're family,
you should know.

10:07.034 --> 10:08.500
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

10:08.536 --> 10:09.568
Thank you so much.

10:09.603 --> 10:10.869
<i>Okay, bye, Joy.</i>

10:10.905 --> 10:12.371
What's going on?

10:12.406 --> 10:13.372
My aunt got hurt.

10:13.407 --> 10:14.873
I have to go.

10:14.942 --> 10:17.709
Do you want me to write
the Weatherton's report?

10:17.778 --> 10:19.011
No, that's okay.

10:19.079 --> 10:21.814
I have my laptop,

10:21.849 --> 10:24.116
I'll write it
when I get to Crystal Falls.

10:24.151 --> 10:25.784
Crystal Falls?

10:25.820 --> 10:28.420
It's the closest thing
I have to a home.

11:13.133 --> 11:14.366
Wait...

11:14.401 --> 11:15.401
Are you okay?

11:15.436 --> 11:17.002
Yeah...

11:18.272 --> 11:19.605
Ben?

11:19.640 --> 11:20.672
Hey, Joy.

11:20.708 --> 11:21.974
Ben Andrews?

11:22.009 --> 11:22.908
Long time no see.

11:22.977 --> 11:24.810
Yeah.

11:24.845 --> 11:26.022
Though it's kinda hard
to miss you like this.

11:26.046 --> 11:27.646
Well, just...
trying to make an entrance.

11:27.681 --> 11:28.681
I see that.

11:30.651 --> 11:33.253
Ruby is around the corner,
three doors down.

11:33.287 --> 11:34.219
My mom's with her right now.

11:34.255 --> 11:37.122
- Are you visiting, too?
- Nope, this is my place.

11:37.191 --> 11:38.457
Hospital administrator.

11:38.525 --> 11:41.526
So are you trying
to drum up some business?

11:41.562 --> 11:43.262
You found me out.

11:43.330 --> 11:44.441
Well, I hope visiting hours
aren't over.

11:44.465 --> 11:45.542
Visiting hours are never over.

11:45.566 --> 11:46.832
Never?

11:46.867 --> 11:48.100
Nope.

11:48.135 --> 11:50.369
This is North Carolina, Joy,
not D.C.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.741
How am I supposed to do
the Cookie Crawl like this?

11:55.776 --> 11:56.909
Ben will take over.

11:56.944 --> 11:58.810
It's a two-person job.

11:58.879 --> 12:00.523
Honey, you just concentrate
on what's important.

12:00.547 --> 12:01.947
You're right.

12:02.016 --> 12:03.415
I just made a cake.

12:03.450 --> 12:05.490
Would you be a friend and
go home and get it for me?

12:06.053 --> 12:08.453
And here I was
worried about you.

12:08.489 --> 12:09.855
Joy!

12:09.890 --> 12:10.890
Did you call her?

12:10.958 --> 12:12.157
Aren't you glad I did?

12:12.192 --> 12:14.092
I sure am.

12:14.128 --> 12:15.527
Did you drive
all the way through?

12:15.596 --> 12:18.063
I stopped to get
your favorite magazines,

12:18.098 --> 12:21.867
so that you won't go stir crazy
and try and take over the place.

12:22.970 --> 12:24.369
How's the patient?

12:24.405 --> 12:26.371
Impatient.

12:26.407 --> 12:27.372
Sounds about right.

12:27.408 --> 12:29.007
It's just a silly ankle.

12:29.043 --> 12:30.053
She is seeing
her doctor tomorrow

12:30.077 --> 12:31.043
for the official word.

12:31.078 --> 12:33.779
You're worrying Joy.

12:33.814 --> 12:35.847
We're all worried
about you, Ruby.

12:35.883 --> 12:36.848
Is that Rocky Road?

12:36.884 --> 12:38.150
The rockiest.

12:38.185 --> 12:39.262
Joy, do you remember my son...

12:39.286 --> 12:40.752
Ben.

12:40.788 --> 12:42.032
We sort of ran into each other
down in the lobby, Mom.

12:42.056 --> 12:43.288
It's been a while.

12:43.324 --> 12:45.335
I think the last time I saw you,
you were headed off to college?

12:45.359 --> 12:46.625
Georgetown.

12:46.694 --> 12:47.859
And you went to...

12:47.895 --> 12:49.194
- Columbia.
- Right.

12:49.229 --> 12:50.195
You became a New Yorker.

12:50.230 --> 12:51.897
Yeah, for a little while.

12:54.068 --> 12:55.734
You know what,

12:55.803 --> 12:57.013
I think we should get out
of Ruby's hair for a bit.

12:57.037 --> 12:59.671
What about my animals?
They need feeding.

12:59.707 --> 13:00.672
I can take care of them.

13:00.708 --> 13:03.475
I was actually planning on
staying at the farm tonight.

13:03.510 --> 13:04.510
Thank you, honey.

13:05.713 --> 13:08.580
The Cookie Crawl! Ben!
What are we going to do?

13:08.615 --> 13:10.349
- It's in seven days!
- No, don't...

13:10.384 --> 13:11.594
Is that the thing
where people buy tickets

13:11.618 --> 13:13.819
to go look at decorations
and eat cookies?

13:13.854 --> 13:16.588
- Christmas cookies.
- Yes.

13:16.657 --> 13:18.501
But there are so many
strong competitors this year!

13:18.525 --> 13:20.525
And your aunt has won
the past four years.

13:20.561 --> 13:21.727
Thanks to Ben.

13:22.763 --> 13:23.996
Ben?

13:24.031 --> 13:27.099
Ruby's co-captain
at your service.

13:27.134 --> 13:29.301
Aunt Ruby, why didn't
you ever ask me

13:29.336 --> 13:30.268
to be your co-captain?

13:30.304 --> 13:31.370
I'm your niece.

13:31.405 --> 13:34.239
Honey, you're
never here anymore.

13:34.274 --> 13:35.073
I might have come home.

13:35.109 --> 13:37.609
- From D.C.?
- Yeah.

13:37.678 --> 13:40.412
- To help with a cookie crawl?
- Is that so crazy?

13:41.482 --> 13:42.482
No.

13:45.352 --> 13:47.130
You know, you guys,
we can discuss this later.

13:47.154 --> 13:48.565
I think we should let Ruby
get some rest.

13:48.589 --> 13:50.122
Okay.

13:50.157 --> 13:52.535
I'll come back tomorrow, so we can
hear what the doctor has to say.

13:52.559 --> 13:53.458
Thank you, Joy.

13:53.494 --> 13:54.494
Of course.

13:55.696 --> 13:57.729
It sure is good
seeing you here again.

13:57.765 --> 13:59.398
It's good to see you, too.

14:03.203 --> 14:04.203
Rest up.

14:30.731 --> 14:31.997
Oh, man.

14:32.032 --> 14:34.533
Normally I'd say hindsight is 20/20,
but not in this case.

14:34.601 --> 14:36.001
You're hilarious.

14:36.070 --> 14:38.804
I thought these things
came with cool cameras

14:38.839 --> 14:40.472
and cappuccino makers
or something?

14:40.541 --> 14:41.773
Maybe if I'd had a cappuccino

14:41.809 --> 14:43.609
I would have been able
to use the cool camera.

14:44.378 --> 14:47.345
Do you have a pen and paper?
I gotta leave the truck's owner my info.

14:47.381 --> 14:49.414
The truck's owner knows.

14:50.984 --> 14:52.517
Of course.

14:52.553 --> 14:54.686
I'm so sorry.

14:54.721 --> 14:57.189
You know... you wanna
hear the good news?

14:57.257 --> 14:58.257
My truck's fine.

15:01.161 --> 15:04.362
- But your Mini looks disappointed.
- Disappointed!

15:04.398 --> 15:06.242
That you didn't use the cool camera
to avoid something like this!

15:06.266 --> 15:07.365
Well...

15:07.401 --> 15:08.233
But you wanna hear
more good news?

15:08.268 --> 15:09.334
Can't wait.

15:09.369 --> 15:12.471
I know a guy who can fix that
for the cost of parts and a pizza.

15:12.506 --> 15:14.406
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

15:14.475 --> 15:16.174
My cousin, Zeke.

15:16.210 --> 15:18.210
Take it to his place,
any day but Saturday.

15:18.278 --> 15:20.312
- Zeke?
- Yeah.

15:20.347 --> 15:21.613
Why not Saturday?

15:21.648 --> 15:22.826
He helps out at his parents'
diner on Saturday.

15:22.850 --> 15:24.449
Right.

15:24.485 --> 15:26.229
Yeah. Did you forget
how small this town can be?

15:26.253 --> 15:27.253
Apparently.

15:28.455 --> 15:30.122
Should be good to drive for now,

15:30.190 --> 15:33.191
but, hey, let me know
if the bumper falls off.

15:37.531 --> 15:38.497
Thank you.

15:38.532 --> 15:40.198
You're welcome. Anytime.

17:10.790 --> 17:12.523
Yeah, I got it.

17:15.329 --> 17:16.928
Thanks for carrying
those in, sweetie.

17:16.964 --> 17:18.063
Of course.

17:19.398 --> 17:20.632
If it's okay with you,

17:20.666 --> 17:21.810
I think I'm going to swing by
later this week

17:21.835 --> 17:23.435
to pick up the decorations
for the Crawl.

17:23.470 --> 17:24.603
I'm kind of tired.

17:24.637 --> 17:25.748
Are you still planning
to do that? Alone?

17:25.771 --> 17:26.838
Sure.

17:26.873 --> 17:29.874
I'll have to start even earlier
now that Ruby's out of commission.

17:29.910 --> 17:31.543
It's just a lot of work
for one person.

17:31.578 --> 17:32.644
Hi, honey.

17:32.679 --> 17:33.812
Hey...

17:33.847 --> 17:35.814
Dad, what's wrong?

17:35.849 --> 17:38.116
I just finished watching
"It's A Wonderful Life".

17:38.151 --> 17:41.019
It gets me every time.

17:41.088 --> 17:42.187
You are such a softy.

17:42.256 --> 17:44.122
That's why you love me.

17:44.157 --> 17:45.991
Do you remember
Ruby's niece, Joy?

17:46.059 --> 17:47.959
She came to see her
today in the hospital.

17:48.028 --> 17:49.594
Drove all the way
from Washington D.C.

17:49.630 --> 17:51.429
- Well, that was nice of her.
- I know.

17:51.498 --> 17:52.597
I can't believe she said

17:52.666 --> 17:53.810
she'd come back
to help with the Crawl.

17:53.834 --> 17:56.401
A nice gesture
from another big city girl.

17:56.470 --> 17:57.902
Oh, come on, Ben.

17:57.971 --> 18:00.605
Not all city women are...
you-know-who.

18:09.449 --> 18:10.449
Ben?

18:14.621 --> 18:16.388
All this talk about
the Cookie Crawl,

18:16.423 --> 18:18.034
and there's still
so much to prepare for...

18:18.058 --> 18:19.991
our contest,
the gingerbread contest,

18:20.027 --> 18:22.661
and we're...
we're still teammates, right?

18:22.696 --> 18:25.196
As long as Ashley
doesn't go into labor.

18:25.265 --> 18:26.665
You know,

18:26.700 --> 18:28.244
you've been judging
the gingerbread contest

18:28.268 --> 18:29.301
for four years now,

18:29.336 --> 18:33.116
which makes four years
that we couldn't be teammates.

18:33.140 --> 18:36.908
I promise, if Ashley can't be a
judge, I'll find someone else who can.

18:36.943 --> 18:38.443
I love you.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.579
I love you, too.

18:52.027 --> 18:54.127
There you go.

18:55.297 --> 18:58.932
Not exactly
how I pictured my weekend.

19:39.441 --> 19:41.141
You again.

19:41.176 --> 19:42.809
That's a new look.

19:42.844 --> 19:45.312
It was either this,
or an emerald cocktail dress.

19:45.380 --> 19:46.479
Good call.

19:46.548 --> 19:47.992
Mondays are the formal days
around here.

19:48.016 --> 19:50.183
- I'll be sad to miss it.
- Yeah.

19:50.218 --> 19:51.218
Where's the "to-go" line?

19:53.055 --> 19:54.554
Grab a seat,
somebody'll find you.

19:55.524 --> 19:57.123
You in a hurry?

19:57.159 --> 19:58.792
Ruby's meeting
with her doctor today.

19:58.827 --> 19:59.867
You've got plenty of time.

19:59.895 --> 20:01.795
I'll tell them
not to start without you.

20:01.830 --> 20:03.129
Are you going, too?

20:04.132 --> 20:05.165
Mom couldn't make it,

20:05.233 --> 20:08.035
so she wanted me to make sure
Ruby listens to the doctor's orders.

20:08.870 --> 20:10.437
What are the chances of that?

20:12.574 --> 20:13.406
See you there.

20:13.442 --> 20:14.541
Yup.

20:18.213 --> 20:19.145
No!

20:19.181 --> 20:20.380
Aunt Ruby...

20:20.449 --> 20:21.815
It's six days!

20:21.850 --> 20:23.350
I can't put
any weight on it now?

20:23.385 --> 20:24.651
Exactly.

20:24.686 --> 20:25.518
Which is why you'll need
to keep your ankle elevated

20:25.587 --> 20:26.519
for the most part.

20:26.588 --> 20:27.754
I can do all of that at home.

20:27.789 --> 20:30.156
And then you'd just be tempted
to get into the decorations,

20:30.225 --> 20:31.324
which is too risky.

20:31.393 --> 20:32.425
This way is safer.

20:32.461 --> 20:33.960
So, how far away
is the rehab center?

20:34.029 --> 20:36.529
- About two hours south.
- It's too far!

20:36.565 --> 20:38.732
- Your insurance covers it.
- That's not the point.

20:38.767 --> 20:41.034
I won't be able to do
the Christmas Cookie Crawl.

20:41.069 --> 20:42.869
It's important to me.

20:42.904 --> 20:44.771
You'll be home
in time to participate.

20:44.806 --> 20:46.807
- But not prepare.
- I'll prepare.

20:46.842 --> 20:49.342
That way, when you get home,
you won't miss a thing.

20:49.411 --> 20:52.012
Honey, it is so much work.

20:52.080 --> 20:52.879
Don't worry about it.

20:52.914 --> 20:55.615
Besides, you took me in
at the worst time in my life,

20:55.651 --> 20:57.117
and made me feel safe and loved.

20:57.185 --> 20:58.185
It's the least I can do.

20:58.220 --> 21:01.521
- But what about your job?
- Let me worry about that.

21:01.556 --> 21:03.223
I've got some vacation days,

21:03.258 --> 21:04.902
and I've got my laptop,
so I can work remotely.

21:04.926 --> 21:08.395
Listen, you just focus on healing,
and I'll take care of everything,

21:08.463 --> 21:09.503
including the Crawl, okay?

21:25.247 --> 21:26.579
Joy!

21:26.648 --> 21:28.960
I'm so glad I found you,
I tried to catch you at the hospital.

21:28.984 --> 21:30.483
- Here's my card.
- Why?

21:30.519 --> 21:33.319
So you can call me,
set up a time to meet,

21:33.355 --> 21:34.254
go over the specifics
of the Crawl.

21:34.289 --> 21:35.588
Why would we need to meet?

21:35.624 --> 21:36.901
We have a lot of ground
to cover in six days.

21:36.925 --> 21:38.291
We've got to figure out a theme.

21:38.326 --> 21:40.471
Ruby keeps a record of all
the themes that've been used,

21:40.495 --> 21:41.661
which is helpful.

21:41.730 --> 21:43.370
Last year's was
"International Christmas".

21:43.398 --> 21:44.964
Once we figure out a theme,

21:45.033 --> 21:47.867
we have to create the interior
and exterior design,

21:47.903 --> 21:50.070
integrate the Christmas trees...

21:50.138 --> 21:52.238
- "Trees", plural?
- Yes, plural.

21:52.307 --> 21:54.774
- I'm thinking four, maybe five?
- Five trees?

21:54.810 --> 21:56.109
Yeah, you'll see.

21:56.144 --> 21:57.989
And we've got to start
making the dough reserves.

21:58.013 --> 21:59.245
- Dough reserves?
- Yeah.

21:59.281 --> 22:00.792
We're going to be making
a lot of cookies,

22:00.816 --> 22:02.126
but first, we have to make
a lot of dough.

22:02.150 --> 22:03.428
Okay, Ben, I appreciate the fact

22:03.452 --> 22:04.896
that you've helped my aunt
over the last few years,

22:04.920 --> 22:07.221
however, I just need an overview,
not a co-captain.

22:07.255 --> 22:09.089
This is a two-person job...

22:09.124 --> 22:11.369
Which describes
most of the jobs I already do,

22:11.393 --> 22:12.892
except I do them alone.

22:17.199 --> 22:18.309
You don't know
what you're getting into.

22:18.333 --> 22:20.767
It's Christmas trees and cookies,
not advanced calculus,

22:20.802 --> 22:21.935
which, by the way, I aced.

22:23.438 --> 22:24.482
Then you'll understand
these numbers...

22:24.506 --> 22:27.774
20 dozen sugars,
14 dozen thumbprints,

22:27.809 --> 22:30.543
10 dozen shortbread,
four dozen lemon bars,

22:30.579 --> 22:33.279
40 dozen chocolate chip,
regular and chocolate-chocolate.

22:33.348 --> 22:35.248
30 dozen brownies,
with and without nuts.

22:35.317 --> 22:36.516
- Both?
- Both.

22:36.551 --> 22:37.695
All that's just
what we did last year.

22:37.719 --> 22:39.152
15's another number.

22:39.187 --> 22:41.521
That's how many houses
are participating this year,

22:41.556 --> 22:43.089
each trying to win
the golden wreath.

22:43.125 --> 22:44.524
- The...
- Golden wreath?

22:44.593 --> 22:45.992
- That's a thing?
- A big thing.

22:46.027 --> 22:47.260
Your aunt's thing.

22:47.295 --> 22:51.431
The thing you just promised
to take care of, alone.

22:51.466 --> 22:53.701
Good luck, Solo,
and welcome back.

23:02.811 --> 23:04.177
<i>Seven days?</i>

23:04.212 --> 23:06.324
Well, five,
and there's a weekend in there,

23:06.348 --> 23:07.625
so it's really
not as many as it seems.

23:07.649 --> 23:09.983
<i>I thought you went home
because of your aunt.</i>

23:10.018 --> 23:12.418
I did, and that led me
to the Cookie Crawl.

23:12.454 --> 23:14.087
<i>Cookie?</i>

23:14.122 --> 23:17.223
It's this thing, it's important to her,
so it's important to me...

23:17.259 --> 23:19.092
<i>No, no, no, I get it,
family is first.</i>

23:19.127 --> 23:20.527
Thank you.

23:20.562 --> 23:22.206
Okay, and I brought my laptop
and cell phone with me,

23:22.230 --> 23:23.530
so I can work remotely.

23:23.565 --> 23:25.365
<i>I saw the Weatherton's
report went out.</i>

23:25.400 --> 23:26.499
<i>It was perfect.</i>

23:26.535 --> 23:27.567
Great.

23:27.636 --> 23:29.035
<i>The good news is</i>

23:29.104 --> 23:30.982
<i>we're headed into the December
pre-holiday slowdown,</i>

23:31.006 --> 23:33.050
<i>but you will be back in time
for The Christmas Gala, yes?</i>

23:33.074 --> 23:34.340
Absolutely.

23:34.409 --> 23:35.308
I already have my dress.

23:35.343 --> 23:36.376
<i>Okay, good.</i>

23:36.411 --> 23:37.411
<i>Happy baking.</i>

23:37.445 --> 23:38.445
Thank you.

23:38.480 --> 23:39.813
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

24:08.176 --> 24:10.743
Joy said she wanted to do
the whole thing by herself.

24:10.812 --> 24:12.545
What?

24:12.581 --> 24:14.547
And you agreed?

24:14.616 --> 24:16.182
I can't make her work with me.

24:16.218 --> 24:17.495
Besides, this way,
I'll have more time

24:17.519 --> 24:19.452
to focus on the gingerbread
contest with you.

24:19.487 --> 24:21.120
Yeah, but does she
truly have any idea

24:21.156 --> 24:22.366
what she's getting herself into?

24:22.390 --> 24:24.724
She will when I bring over
the decorations

24:24.759 --> 24:25.879
I still have from last year.

24:33.235 --> 24:34.200
"Find a theme.

24:34.236 --> 24:35.401
"Make dough.

24:35.470 --> 24:36.402
"Decorate the house.

24:36.471 --> 24:37.837
Make the cookies".

24:37.873 --> 24:38.873
Not so bad.

24:52.621 --> 24:54.220
This is bonkers.

25:01.796 --> 25:03.196
Hi.

25:03.265 --> 25:04.664
Yet another new look for you.

25:04.699 --> 25:05.732
Yeah, well, I figured

25:05.767 --> 25:08.635
if I'm gonna be here for a few days,
I should do some shopping.

25:08.670 --> 25:09.702
What brings you here?

25:09.738 --> 25:12.872
- I brought decorations for the Crawl.
- Actually, I already found them.

25:12.908 --> 25:14.875
You found half of 'em.
I have the other half.

25:18.513 --> 25:19.979
Is all this really necessary?

25:21.416 --> 25:22.860
You can probably
do without a few boxes.

25:22.884 --> 25:25.485
Depends on how many
trees you use.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.821
Once you figure out more of
your theme, you know, you'll...

25:28.857 --> 25:30.556
You have figured out
your theme, right?

25:30.592 --> 25:33.060
I figured I'd start baking first,
and get inspired.

25:37.065 --> 25:38.731
I gather you disapprove.

25:38.767 --> 25:40.266
It's your show.

25:43.138 --> 25:44.304
But from my experience,

25:44.339 --> 25:46.873
I'd figure out a theme
as soon as possible.

25:46.942 --> 25:47.774
Okay, why not go with
the most direct?

25:47.809 --> 25:48.809
Christmas Cookies.

25:49.945 --> 25:51.311
More disapproval?

25:51.346 --> 25:52.946
At least try.

25:52.981 --> 25:55.114
It's not just about the cookies.

25:55.150 --> 25:56.790
It's about the whole
Christmas experience.

25:56.818 --> 25:58.284
Okay, what theme
would you choose?

25:59.554 --> 26:01.087
I thought
you didn't want my help.

26:01.122 --> 26:03.356
I'm just asking
for a casual suggestion.

26:03.391 --> 26:05.858
Based on my years
of Cookie Crawl experience.

26:05.894 --> 26:08.227
- All right, I'll pay you.
- Pay me?

26:08.296 --> 26:11.030
I mean, what's the going rate
for Cookie Crawl consultation?

26:11.099 --> 26:14.000
Joy, here in small towns,
we help each other

26:14.035 --> 26:16.714
because it's the right thing to do,
not because somebody's paying us.

26:16.738 --> 26:18.698
If you do want my help,
you know where to find me.

26:41.732 --> 26:43.398
I got this.

27:20.404 --> 27:24.940
Okay, Margie, I'm all yours.

28:03.213 --> 28:04.579
Back again.

28:04.615 --> 28:05.747
Yes,

28:05.783 --> 28:07.683
I need coffee in the mornings.

28:07.718 --> 28:08.784
Smart.

28:08.852 --> 28:10.085
The coffee here's good.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.920
Ben, I'm sorry.

28:13.824 --> 28:15.168
I want to apologize
for offering to pay.

28:15.192 --> 28:16.058
I didn't mean to offend you.

28:16.126 --> 28:18.226
Thank you.

28:18.295 --> 28:19.628
I probably overreacted a bit.

28:19.663 --> 28:20.996
Why?

28:21.031 --> 28:22.898
I guess I...

28:22.933 --> 28:27.269
it just reminded me of something
my ex-wife might have done,

28:27.304 --> 28:28.937
still hits a nerve I guess.

28:28.972 --> 28:29.972
I'm sorry.

28:30.007 --> 28:31.773
Don't worry about it at all.

28:31.809 --> 28:35.445
I was thinking about the
Cookie Crawl, and I think...

28:39.516 --> 28:40.582
Excuse me.

28:40.617 --> 28:41.583
Yeah.

28:41.618 --> 28:42.584
Of course.

28:42.619 --> 28:43.619
Hello?

28:45.055 --> 28:46.588
Hey!

28:46.657 --> 28:47.889
Oh, you did?

28:47.958 --> 28:48.958
That's amazing.

28:52.463 --> 28:53.463
He's a big boy.

28:55.365 --> 28:57.065
Bye-bye. Thanks.

29:03.307 --> 29:05.240
Everything okay?

29:05.275 --> 29:07.242
Yeah, actually, it's great news.

29:07.277 --> 29:09.377
- My assistant had her baby.
- Good for her!

29:09.413 --> 29:10.645
Yeah, a week early.

29:10.681 --> 29:11.958
Everyone's...
everyone's healthy,

29:11.982 --> 29:13.515
and that's what's important.

29:13.550 --> 29:17.252
I'm sensing
there's more to the story.

29:17.287 --> 29:19.421
Selfishly.

29:19.456 --> 29:22.124
Ashley was running
the local gingerbread contest.

29:22.159 --> 29:24.025
Wait, full stop.

29:24.061 --> 29:26.695
Crystal Falls has a
Christmas Cookie Crawl

29:26.730 --> 29:27.929
and a gingerbread contest?

29:29.666 --> 29:32.567
Do the grand prizes come with
a lifetime gym membership?

29:32.636 --> 29:35.203
No, but that's...
that's a good idea.

29:35.239 --> 29:37.083
All right, so why is
the happy arrival of a baby

29:37.107 --> 29:38.507
problematic for you?

29:38.542 --> 29:40.386
Because Ashley took over
the gingerbread contest from me

29:40.410 --> 29:41.421
so I could enter with my mom.

29:41.445 --> 29:42.811
That's so cute.

29:42.846 --> 29:44.980
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
it's not gonna happen now.

29:45.048 --> 29:46.815
I can't judge and participate.

29:46.884 --> 29:50.352
- Why do you have to judge?
- Because there's no one else.

29:50.387 --> 29:52.554
At this point,
everyone's either entered

29:52.589 --> 29:55.657
or doing something
else on the 22nd,

29:55.692 --> 29:57.826
so I'm gonna have to break
my promise to my mom,

29:57.861 --> 30:01.463
unless I can find s...

30:03.167 --> 30:04.167
What?

30:05.235 --> 30:07.636
- You'll be in town then.
- Me?

30:07.671 --> 30:10.405
Oh, no, Captain Christmas,
this time, you've gone too far.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.107
Come on, please, I'm begging.

30:12.142 --> 30:13.142
No, no, no, no,

30:13.177 --> 30:14.876
I am up to here in cookie prep.

30:14.912 --> 30:17.223
Not to mention my real job,
for which I'm up for a promotion,

30:17.247 --> 30:18.680
and can't let anything slide.

30:18.715 --> 30:20.949
And my company's formal
Christmas gala is that night.

30:20.984 --> 30:23.885
- I'll help with the Cookie Crawl.
- We've already went over this.

30:23.954 --> 30:25.465
I know you said
you like to do things solo,

30:25.489 --> 30:28.290
but that was before you saw
what a huge undertaking it was.

30:28.325 --> 30:30.158
Come on, you already look tired.

30:30.227 --> 30:31.259
Thanks!

30:31.295 --> 30:33.428
A pretty kind of tired.

30:33.463 --> 30:36.411
You gotta admit, it's more
than you imagined it'd be, right?

30:37.601 --> 30:40.068
Judging the gingerbread contest
is barely anything!

30:40.103 --> 30:42.237
Ashley already did
99.9% of the work.

30:42.306 --> 30:43.683
All right, don't try
and dazzle me with data.

30:43.707 --> 30:45.006
We can help each other.

30:45.042 --> 30:48.810
I'll pitch in for the Cookie Crawl,
I'll do all the heavy lifting.

30:48.846 --> 30:51.913
Seriously, I will lift heavy objects,
and whatever else you need.

30:51.949 --> 30:53.748
What do you say?

30:53.784 --> 30:56.551
Me and you?
Cookies and gingerbread?

30:58.088 --> 30:59.221
Fine.

30:59.256 --> 31:01.723
Cookies and gingerbread.

31:05.529 --> 31:06.529
"Captain Christmas"?

31:07.564 --> 31:09.297
That's you.

31:16.006 --> 31:18.473
Recipes...

31:20.310 --> 31:21.443
Recipes...

31:32.022 --> 31:33.499
<i>My mom gave me
a Christmas ornament once</i>

31:33.523 --> 31:35.490
<i>that was exactly this color.</i>

31:54.611 --> 31:56.511
No, I really think

31:56.546 --> 31:58.706
that we should leave the
candy focus group in December,

31:58.749 --> 32:00.226
because by January,
people will be all sugared out.

32:00.250 --> 32:02.017
And I can say that
with great confidence.

32:02.085 --> 32:03.785
<i>What is going on?</i>

32:03.820 --> 32:05.487
<i>Are you making cookies
for an army?</i>

32:05.555 --> 32:08.189
I mean, you cannot imagine
how much preparation this takes.

32:08.225 --> 32:10.558
<i>Hold on while I switch
this conversation to record.</i>

32:12.195 --> 32:13.573
<i>Is this the contest
you're judging?</i>

32:13.597 --> 32:15.664
Nope, that's
the gingerbread contest.

32:15.699 --> 32:17.565
All of this is for
the Cookie Crawl.

32:17.634 --> 32:20.602
<i>It is a whole new world
you have entered.</i>

32:20.637 --> 32:22.003
Yes.

32:22.039 --> 32:24.673
Which is why I need you
to tell me workish things,

32:24.741 --> 32:27.208
I need the contrast.

32:27.244 --> 32:28.310
<i>Well, it's just a rumor.</i>

32:28.378 --> 32:30.979
Oh, go on.

32:31.048 --> 32:33.882
<i>Something's going on
with the Weatherton's account.</i>

32:33.917 --> 32:35.050
Like what?

32:35.085 --> 32:36.384
<i>That's just it, nobody knows.</i>

32:36.420 --> 32:38.353
<i>But someone overheard
Margie's assistant</i>

32:38.388 --> 32:41.022
<i>talking about bringing up
all of the Weatherton's files.</i>

32:41.058 --> 32:43.858
That must go back
a decade at least.

32:43.927 --> 32:45.126
<i>Well, it could be nothing.</i>

32:45.162 --> 32:47.028
Or it could be something.

32:47.097 --> 32:48.830
I know I'm not lead
on their account,

32:48.899 --> 32:50.732
but they really are
my favorite client.

32:52.369 --> 32:53.735
Come in!

32:53.770 --> 32:56.104
<i>Is that the gingerbread guy?</i>

32:56.173 --> 32:57.173
Hey.

32:57.207 --> 32:58.673
Hi! Say hi to Renee.

32:58.709 --> 32:59.808
Hi.

32:59.843 --> 33:01.076
Ben, Renee.
Renee, Ben.

33:01.144 --> 33:03.011
<i>That's Ben?</i>

33:03.046 --> 33:04.379
Nice to kinda meet you, Renee.

33:04.448 --> 33:06.481
You, too, Ben.

33:06.516 --> 33:08.294
All right, we're off
to make our cookie dough.

33:08.318 --> 33:09.985
Even though we don't have
a theme yet.

33:10.020 --> 33:13.154
It's possible that
we could be inspired

33:13.223 --> 33:14.656
by making our "dough reserves".

33:14.725 --> 33:16.725
Though that hasn't been
my experience.

33:19.696 --> 33:21.396
All right, I gotta go, bye.

33:21.431 --> 33:22.431
<i>Bye.</i>

33:24.901 --> 33:26.868
What's wrong?

33:26.903 --> 33:28.303
Nothing.

33:28.338 --> 33:30.183
Just looks like you're making
the oatmeal raisin first.

33:30.207 --> 33:32.407
I am, because
they're my favorite.

33:32.442 --> 33:34.642
I usually like to start
with the chocolate chip.

33:34.678 --> 33:35.610
It tends to last longer.

33:35.645 --> 33:38.391
Okay, well, just because that's
how you've always done things,

33:38.415 --> 33:39.625
doesn't mean that's how
they should always be done.

33:39.649 --> 33:41.082
Tell that
to four Golden Wreaths.

33:41.118 --> 33:44.519
All right, maybe you should just
open up to some new possibilities.

33:44.554 --> 33:46.187
The possibility of losing.

33:47.257 --> 33:50.125
I'm gonna do my batch,
you do your thing.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.793
Great. I think I will.

34:14.186 --> 34:17.521
- Not bad for our first round.
- "First round," he says so easily.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.623
It's a little tricky.

34:22.293 --> 34:23.293
There we go.

34:27.666 --> 34:30.166
- Impressive.
- Thank you.

34:30.202 --> 34:33.614
I get a bizarre satisfaction from
crossing things off my "to-do" lists.

34:33.638 --> 34:35.170
That's half the fun of my job.

34:35.206 --> 34:36.984
You know, you don't really
strike me as an admin guy.

34:37.007 --> 34:39.009
- It's the flannel.
- You're right.

34:39.077 --> 34:42.312
So, I was looking through
some of Aunt Ruby's notebooks,

34:42.380 --> 34:44.714
and you're right, there is
a big emphasis on theme.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.516
Did you just say I was right?

34:47.518 --> 34:49.185
Anyway...

34:49.221 --> 34:52.121
I started brainstorming
some theme ideas.

34:52.157 --> 34:53.157
You wanna hear?

34:53.190 --> 34:54.623
Go for it.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.504
Okay, studies show
that people are drawn to things

34:56.527 --> 34:57.927
that are twists on the familiar,

34:57.963 --> 34:59.696
so I was thinking,

34:59.765 --> 35:01.564
"Frosty the Snowman
goes tropical".

35:04.803 --> 35:06.536
I see melting.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.839
Okay, maybe not the best twist.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.674
What about Dickens?

35:11.710 --> 35:12.820
I'm a sucker
for "A Christmas Carol".

35:12.844 --> 35:15.378
It was done in 2012.

35:15.414 --> 35:16.946
Mabel Pine.
She came in third.

35:16.982 --> 35:18.148
Before my time.

35:21.019 --> 35:23.686
What about
Dickens 2.0?

35:23.755 --> 35:27.257
A virtual-reality Scrooge
goes back and forth in time?

35:28.460 --> 35:29.692
Come on, we're "twisting".

35:29.728 --> 35:31.873
I like the classics
to stay pretty much classic.

35:31.897 --> 35:34.731
- Yes, and dated.
- Not dated. Proven.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.733
Proven to be dated.

35:40.539 --> 35:43.673
Look... look at this.
Look at this ornament.

35:43.708 --> 35:44.741
It's gorgeous.

35:44.776 --> 35:47.645
Simple, classic.
It doesn't need a twist.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.979
Why mess with
something proven to be...

35:59.558 --> 36:02.158
Joy, I am...
I am so, so sorry.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.115
It's okay, I'll get a broom.

36:06.465 --> 36:07.864
It was just...

36:07.933 --> 36:09.132
it was from my mom.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.460
Here, I'll clean it up.

36:37.496 --> 36:38.595
Thanks.

36:41.833 --> 36:44.367
Who's Phil Finnegan?

36:44.402 --> 36:48.171
He's the regional sales rep
for Carolina's Best Flour.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.140
They're the sponsors
for the gingerbread contest.

36:51.176 --> 36:54.644
He wants to meet
for coffee in an hour.

36:54.679 --> 36:57.013
He probably just wants to go
over the rules, the contest,

36:57.082 --> 36:59.382
- get you up to speed.
- Okay.

37:03.455 --> 37:06.723
How about this...
I'll follow you to Zeke's,

37:06.758 --> 37:08.925
so you can drop off your car
before you meet with Phil,

37:08.994 --> 37:10.026
then I'll drive you home.

37:11.029 --> 37:12.795
Okay.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.665
- But you're buying Zeke's pizza.
- Done.

37:21.306 --> 37:22.306
Ready?

37:23.375 --> 37:24.240
Pizza for repairs, all right?

37:24.276 --> 37:25.375
Thanks, Ben.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.010
- Yup, as promised.
- Thank you.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.878
- You're welcome.
- I appreciate it.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.491
- Deluxe, right?
- Just what you ordered.

37:30.515 --> 37:31.515
All right...

37:42.427 --> 37:43.826
Hi, Phil.

37:43.895 --> 37:46.062
There you are.
I was getting nervous.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.730
We're three minutes early.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.799
But it's only three days
until the contest,

37:49.868 --> 37:52.735
and I want to make sure
that she knows everything.

37:52.771 --> 37:53.915
There's so much
for you to learn.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.305
Phil Finnegan, Joy Holbrook.

37:55.340 --> 37:58.575
Hi.
How much exactly?

37:58.643 --> 38:00.977
These are our rules
and regulations.

38:01.012 --> 38:02.023
Now, it would be really helpful

38:02.047 --> 38:03.947
if you could get
up to speed on these

38:03.982 --> 38:06.282
as quickly as possible.

38:06.318 --> 38:08.918
Being a judge is
a lot of responsibility.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.422
I don't suppose
there's a shorter version.

38:14.359 --> 38:15.992
This is the shorter version.

38:18.396 --> 38:19.529
Great.

38:19.564 --> 38:21.831
Three days, huh?

38:21.866 --> 38:26.970
- You are so buying me dinner.
- Yes. Yes, I am.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.108
Crystal Falls Lodge.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.644
I can't remember
the last time I was here.

38:34.713 --> 38:35.612
Let me guess, prom?

38:35.647 --> 38:38.114
No, actually.
I didn't go to prom.

38:38.183 --> 38:40.483
- That's surprising.
- Not really.

38:40.518 --> 38:41.629
I mean, I moved here
when I was 15.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.752
You know, at that point,

38:42.821 --> 38:44.098
everybody already had
their best friends

38:44.122 --> 38:46.189
since elementary school.

38:46.224 --> 38:47.557
And that was
right after my mom...

38:49.527 --> 38:51.160
So, I wasn't exactly
in the best place.

38:51.196 --> 38:54.163
- That I remember.
- I'm sure you do.

38:54.232 --> 38:56.199
Your mom made you
take me to the movies

38:56.234 --> 38:58.701
when you were home from college
on your Christmas break.

38:58.737 --> 38:59.769
Asked.

38:59.804 --> 39:01.504
Still.
It couldn't have been fun.

39:01.539 --> 39:03.439
You were quiet, but I knew why.

39:03.508 --> 39:06.342
And if I remember correctly,
the movie was good.

39:06.378 --> 39:09.313
- "Love, Actually" is the best.
- Is that which one it was?

39:09.347 --> 39:10.380
I think so.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.082
I'd forgotten about that.

39:16.921 --> 39:18.388
When was the last time
you were home?

39:19.591 --> 39:20.790
Gosh, I don't know.

39:20.859 --> 39:24.994
Probably not since
I graduated from college.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.930
I mean, I started working
right away, all the time.

39:27.999 --> 39:31.367
And Aunt Ruby comes
to visit me in D.C., so...

39:31.403 --> 39:33.369
I didn't realize
how long it had been until...

39:33.438 --> 39:37.347
Well, I know Ruby would love
to have you around more.

39:41.246 --> 39:42.945
Plus, this is a nice town.

39:42.981 --> 39:45.381
It is.

39:45.417 --> 39:49.052
- Some might even call it "classic".
- Whoa, don't push it.

39:57.195 --> 40:00.496
- I'm hungry.
- Yeah, me too.

40:00.532 --> 40:03.399
- Ben!
- Mom, Dad, hi!

40:03.435 --> 40:05.301
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Andrews.

40:05.336 --> 40:07.070
Joy, it's so good
to see you again.

40:07.105 --> 40:08.204
You too.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.206
Joy, could you
excuse us for a second?

40:10.241 --> 40:11.441
Of course.

40:14.879 --> 40:17.480
So, what...
Are you two on a date?

40:17.515 --> 40:18.681
No.

40:18.717 --> 40:21.951
No, we were working on
the contest together,

40:21.986 --> 40:24.088
and, you know, got hungry.
At the same time.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.291
- Couldn't just order a pizza?
- It's not like that.

40:28.326 --> 40:29.826
I see.

40:29.861 --> 40:33.396
Mom...
She's leaving in a few days,

40:33.431 --> 40:34.731
and you know

40:34.766 --> 40:36.043
I don't date people
who live in the city anymore.

40:36.067 --> 40:38.501
- I thought you were over Anne.
- I am over Anne,

40:38.536 --> 40:41.537
but it doesn't mean
I can't learn from the lesson.

40:41.573 --> 40:42.939
Which is?

40:42.974 --> 40:44.707
"Stay in your lane".

40:44.776 --> 40:48.010
Well, just remember, my son,
if you never leave your lane,

40:48.079 --> 40:50.747
the scenery's gonna get
mighty boring.

41:02.763 --> 41:03.995
Hey, Margie.

41:04.031 --> 41:05.196
<i>Am I calling too late?</i>

41:05.232 --> 41:06.564
No, it's fine.
What's up?

41:06.600 --> 41:07.699
Good.

41:07.734 --> 41:10.735
I want you to write up the report
on the Hansen Candy focus group.

41:10.771 --> 41:12.671
I thought Renee
was handling that?

41:12.706 --> 41:16.341
Yes, but her boyfriend is surprising
her with a birthday weekend,

41:16.376 --> 41:19.044
and I told her that you would
take over since you're not busy.

41:19.112 --> 41:21.179
Well, I am busy...

41:21.248 --> 41:24.349
<i>Surely, you can make time
between making cookies.</i>

41:25.318 --> 41:26.551
Yeah, of course.

41:26.586 --> 41:27.986
Just send me the transcripts.

41:28.055 --> 41:30.933
Already have, with my notes,
and I'll need it by noon tomorrow.

41:30.957 --> 41:32.557
Really appreciate it.

41:32.592 --> 41:33.592
<i>Bye!</i>

41:33.660 --> 41:34.660
Bye.

42:46.066 --> 42:48.299
So, where are you
with the dough count?

42:48.335 --> 42:49.912
I've got about a quarter
of the sugar cookie dough done

42:49.936 --> 42:51.002
and some brownies, too.

42:51.037 --> 42:52.003
"Some" brownies?

42:52.038 --> 42:56.307
I know for a fact that Fern
Hartley's freezer is 3/4 full.

42:56.343 --> 42:58.109
And you know
Twyla Taft's at capacity.

42:58.145 --> 42:59.611
Oh, yeah.

42:59.646 --> 43:01.379
Okay, I will focus
on our dough count.

43:01.414 --> 43:04.449
And if you want my advice,
I would double the Oreo snowmen.

43:04.518 --> 43:06.885
Ruby here tends to run out.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.720
I do not.

43:08.755 --> 43:10.133
Well, you were
down to one last year.

43:10.157 --> 43:12.524
- That's not running out.
- Well, you got lucky.

43:14.361 --> 43:15.460
So...

43:15.495 --> 43:17.295
have you started decorating yet?

43:17.330 --> 43:18.941
No, we thought we'd do that
after we figure out our theme.

43:18.965 --> 43:20.665
You haven't picked a theme?

43:20.734 --> 43:21.734
Oh, dear.

43:21.768 --> 43:23.902
It's in three days,
and you don't have a theme?

43:23.937 --> 43:25.381
Ben and I are
kicking around some ideas.

43:25.405 --> 43:26.538
And?

43:26.573 --> 43:28.273
It's definitely not
"Tropical Frosty".

43:36.316 --> 43:38.650
How you doing, honey?
You seem a little wiped.

43:38.685 --> 43:40.985
I had an emergency work project
come in late last night.

43:41.021 --> 43:44.222
- What, due ASAP?
- Is there any other way?

43:44.257 --> 43:46.658
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

43:46.726 --> 43:49.561
Well, I'm glad those days
are behind me.

43:49.596 --> 43:50.895
Yeah...

43:50.931 --> 43:53.598
I used to be a paralegal,
back in the day.

43:53.667 --> 43:58.636
Everything was urgent, and
I just was on the go constantly,

43:58.672 --> 44:01.172
yet, you know,
never getting anywhere.

44:01.208 --> 44:02.540
So, what did you do?

44:02.609 --> 44:06.945
I walked away, and started
working at the hospital,

44:06.980 --> 44:09.647
and I've never looked back.

44:09.716 --> 44:12.617
I don't know that
I can just walk away.

44:12.686 --> 44:14.552
I've put so much
of myself into my job.

44:16.223 --> 44:18.890
Does it make you happy, honey?

44:18.925 --> 44:20.959
Parts of it do.

44:20.994 --> 44:22.660
Other parts, not so much.

44:22.696 --> 44:24.529
Well, maybe it's just about

44:24.598 --> 44:27.332
figuring out which parts
are most important to you.

44:29.502 --> 44:31.502
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

44:49.856 --> 44:51.234
So, I was looking through
Ashley's notes,

44:51.258 --> 44:53.658
and it doesn't look like
you guys use blind voting

44:53.727 --> 44:54.804
for the gingerbread contest.

44:54.828 --> 44:56.861
<i>That's right.</i>

44:56.897 --> 44:59.364
Well, I mean, that can lead people
to load up on one entry,

44:59.399 --> 45:00.698
or to give pity votes
to another.

45:02.068 --> 45:03.034
<i>Do you have another idea?</i>

45:03.069 --> 45:04.636
I do.

45:04.671 --> 45:06.115
I'm gonna have to
email you, though, okay?

45:06.139 --> 45:07.071
<i>Okay.</i>

45:07.140 --> 45:08.840
Okay, bye.

45:08.875 --> 45:11.843
- Aren't you cold?
- No.

45:11.878 --> 45:15.146
I have hot chocolate,
with a special ingredient.

45:15.181 --> 45:16.741
What's wrong with
regular hot chocolate?

45:17.717 --> 45:18.797
Come on, you can handle it.

45:21.354 --> 45:23.388
- It's cayenne.
- Pepper?

45:23.423 --> 45:24.789
Makes it double warm.

45:24.824 --> 45:26.502
Did you get that trick
from one of Ruby's notebooks?

45:26.526 --> 45:29.360
No, actually, my mom used
to do that when I was little.

45:29.396 --> 45:31.029
It's delicious.

45:31.064 --> 45:32.230
See? New things.

45:33.700 --> 45:35.934
So, I bet you're wondering
why I called this meeting.

45:35.969 --> 45:38.770
- It's either cookies or gingerbread.
- It's the Cookie Crawl.

45:38.805 --> 45:40.805
We need to get started
on finding our theme

45:40.840 --> 45:42.740
so that we can start decorating.

45:42.776 --> 45:44.120
I'm still not doing
virtual-reality Scrooge.

45:44.144 --> 45:45.276
No, I know.

45:45.345 --> 45:47.690
Have you ever heard the phrase
"creativity happens in the cracks"?

45:47.714 --> 45:49.113
Can't say I have.

45:49.149 --> 45:50.192
Okay, so it basically means

45:50.216 --> 45:52.528
you knock your head against
an idea for however long it takes,

45:52.552 --> 45:54.592
but staring at a computer
or a blank piece of paper,

45:54.621 --> 45:56.054
you get nowhere,

45:56.122 --> 45:59.424
but you go take a shower, wash
your dishes, suddenly, voila!

45:59.459 --> 46:01.427
- The answer appears.
- Exactly.

46:01.461 --> 46:05.163
So... today, we're
going to find the crack.

46:11.404 --> 46:12.904
How'd you find this place?

46:12.939 --> 46:14.305
My Aunt Ruby
used to bring me here.

46:14.341 --> 46:16.874
- To the Wildfire Inn?
- To what's inside it.

46:34.060 --> 46:35.927
I totally forgot
this place was here.

46:35.996 --> 46:38.808
Oh, you, Captain Christmas,
forgot about an ice-skating rink?

46:38.832 --> 46:40.798
I know, right?

46:40.834 --> 46:43.835
A new rink was built closer
to town about 10 years ago.

46:43.870 --> 46:45.103
I like this one.

46:50.010 --> 46:51.010
Let's give it a go.

46:52.212 --> 46:54.078
Okay.

46:54.114 --> 46:55.179
Need help?

46:55.215 --> 46:56.080
- Yeah!
- You're good?

46:56.116 --> 46:58.082
You think?

47:19.105 --> 47:24.509
So, I know it's a billion years later,
but I wanted to thank you

47:24.544 --> 47:26.244
for taking me to the movies
way back when.

47:26.312 --> 47:28.346
Of course.

47:29.649 --> 47:31.249
Okay, so that's ancient history.

47:31.284 --> 47:33.919
- What's your story now?
- My story?

47:36.156 --> 47:39.804
It's sad, mainly because
it's so boring and dateless.

47:39.859 --> 47:41.759
- Really? Nobody?
- I mean...

47:41.795 --> 47:42.894
Come on.

47:42.929 --> 47:46.097
There was a guy, Todd, this summer,
but we just went on a few dates.

47:46.166 --> 47:47.231
Todd...

47:47.300 --> 47:50.301
- How'd that end?
- In a fizzle.

47:50.336 --> 47:51.336
It's always a fizzle.

47:55.108 --> 47:58.342
Always a fizzle, I get that.

48:01.281 --> 48:02.580
Any idea for the theme yet?

48:02.615 --> 48:05.450
- Nope.
- Me neither.

48:05.518 --> 48:08.886
Maybe we're trying too hard
to not try too hard.

48:08.922 --> 48:12.023
Maybe.

48:12.058 --> 48:15.960
Let's listen
to the trees for a second.

48:17.097 --> 48:19.130
Close your eyes.

48:25.105 --> 48:27.839
I have a confession to make.

48:27.874 --> 48:30.875
I come out into the forest
whenever I'm upset about something

48:30.910 --> 48:32.877
and listen to the trees.

48:32.912 --> 48:36.013
It puts things in perspective.

48:36.049 --> 48:39.183
So you're saying
you're a tree whisperer?

48:40.687 --> 48:42.453
I am.

48:42.489 --> 48:44.956
- Do they whisper back?
- All the time.

48:44.991 --> 48:47.425
And what do they say?

48:47.460 --> 48:49.360
It's not so much
about what they say,

48:49.395 --> 48:52.897
it's about how they make me feel
connected to everything.

48:54.868 --> 48:57.802
One of my favorite quotes,
it's something like,

48:57.837 --> 49:00.938
"Once we pick out one thing,
"we wind up realizing

49:00.974 --> 49:04.375
"that everything's hitched
to everything else in the Universe".

49:04.444 --> 49:07.078
John Muir.
I always liked that one.

49:07.113 --> 49:08.446
It reminds me of Crystal Falls.

49:08.481 --> 49:10.448
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:10.483 --> 49:11.727
I mean, everything
here is connected.

49:11.751 --> 49:14.552
I mean, just being home
has made me realize

49:14.587 --> 49:18.222
that no matter how far away I go,
or how long I've been gone,

49:18.258 --> 49:21.959
that I am still hitched
to Crystal Falls.

49:21.995 --> 49:25.029
- So why don't you come back more?
- I don't know,

49:25.098 --> 49:28.599
I was only here for a couple of years
right after my mom passed,

49:28.635 --> 49:29.912
and then when I went
away to school,

49:29.936 --> 49:31.269
I think maybe it was easier

49:31.304 --> 49:35.239
to pretend like I wasn't from anywhere,
or connected to anything.

49:35.275 --> 49:39.744
But then your mom called,
and I realized, I am connected,

49:39.779 --> 49:43.916
to my Aunt Ruby,
to my good memories here, and...

49:43.983 --> 49:44.983
Wait.

49:52.125 --> 49:53.624
Wait, that's it.

49:53.660 --> 49:55.293
- What?
- Our theme!

49:55.328 --> 49:58.863
Mother Nature, about how we're
all connected through nature,

49:58.898 --> 50:01.365
and it becomes especially
apparent at Christmas,

50:01.401 --> 50:04.068
when people come together.

50:04.103 --> 50:05.103
I think it's perfect.

50:11.010 --> 50:12.510
So let's go make it happen.

50:52.052 --> 50:54.919
It's beautiful.

50:54.988 --> 50:57.522
And you didn't snag
anyone in the process.

50:57.557 --> 50:59.490
That's half the fun.

50:59.526 --> 51:01.292
Is that something
you make a habit of doing?

51:01.328 --> 51:02.527
You were the first.

51:05.265 --> 51:09.901
Okay, so I think the tables
go here, here, and there.

51:09.936 --> 51:12.470
Ruby always puts them
against that wall over there.

51:12.539 --> 51:13.916
Yeah, but this way
would have better flow.

51:13.940 --> 51:15.773
Better flow?

51:15.842 --> 51:18.476
Yeah, so people can access
both sides of the table.

51:20.380 --> 51:23.483
- You are breaking out in hives.
- I'm fine.

51:23.550 --> 51:24.749
No, you're not.

51:24.785 --> 51:27.018
You're out of your comfort zone,
and it's bugging you.

51:27.054 --> 51:29.732
Is it so wrong for me to want my
comfort zones to be comfortable?

51:29.756 --> 51:32.657
And safe, and proven.

51:32.693 --> 51:35.961
I feel like we're veering away
from table arrangement talk.

51:35.996 --> 51:37.162
All right, that's fine.

51:37.197 --> 51:38.208
We can go back
to the comfort zone.

51:38.232 --> 51:39.232
Thank you.

51:40.434 --> 51:43.468
Although, for the record,
I can do change.

51:43.504 --> 51:45.248
I lived in New York
until a couple years ago.

51:45.272 --> 51:49.241
- So, what brought you back?
- My mom and dad retired.

51:49.276 --> 51:51.409
They always seemed
so invincible,

51:51.445 --> 51:54.246
and then suddenly, they were
taking a step back, and I...

51:54.281 --> 51:56.314
that made me realize
how much I was missing out on.

51:58.585 --> 52:02.287
Seeing them at Christmas
just wasn't enough for me anymore.

52:03.757 --> 52:06.091
So, I got a job at the hospital
and moved home.

52:08.562 --> 52:11.396
- Are you glad you did?
- No question.

52:14.434 --> 52:16.101
I've had more fun today

52:16.169 --> 52:20.405
than I've had
in longer than I can remember.

52:22.543 --> 52:26.678
Well...
I'm glad to be a part of it.

52:26.713 --> 52:28.246
Thank you.

52:40.594 --> 52:41.893
What's wrong?

52:41.929 --> 52:45.664
I have to go.
I have to go...

52:45.699 --> 52:49.134
help my mom with the,
gingerbread contest stuff.

52:49.169 --> 52:50.201
Okay.

52:50.270 --> 52:54.384
Thank you for the ice skating,
and the tree decorating, and...

52:54.408 --> 52:55.740
and everything.

52:55.776 --> 52:57.696
I think we're in good shape
for the Cookie Crawl.

53:42.422 --> 53:44.556
I need some cookies.

53:59.506 --> 54:01.006
No...

54:07.948 --> 54:08.948
No...

54:15.022 --> 54:17.255
The whole top
of the freezer was defrosted,

54:17.290 --> 54:19.057
and the dough went bad.

54:19.126 --> 54:20.492
The bottom half
stayed cold enough.

54:20.527 --> 54:21.760
<i>That's good news.</i>

54:21.795 --> 54:24.340
Yeah, except I had to go two towns
over to replace all the supplies.

54:24.364 --> 54:25.430
Two towns?

54:26.566 --> 54:29.234
Between the gingerbread contest
and the Cookie Crawl,

54:29.269 --> 54:31.280
it's like baking locusts
have descended on this town.

54:31.304 --> 54:33.371
You're not seriously
thinking about

54:33.407 --> 54:34.651
trying to make
more dough, are you?

54:34.675 --> 54:36.875
I have to.
The Crawl's in two days.

54:36.910 --> 54:38.376
With the Gala tomorrow night.

54:38.412 --> 54:41.513
And the gingerbread competition
I'm judging is tomorrow afternoon.

54:41.548 --> 54:43.548
<i>Good luck, Wonder Woman.</i>

54:43.617 --> 54:44.916
I know.

54:44.951 --> 54:47.886
I'm id something's gotta give,
and I'm afraid it might be me.

54:47.921 --> 54:49.761
You're still coming
to the Gala, though, right?

54:49.790 --> 54:50.989
<i>Yes, of course!</i>

54:51.024 --> 54:52.390
Okay, just checking.

54:52.459 --> 54:55.293
You've been in the Land
of Perpetual Sugar so long.

54:55.328 --> 54:56.828
I know how important it is.

54:56.863 --> 55:00.165
Good, because Margie isn't
too thrilled you've been gone.

55:00.233 --> 55:02.100
What do you mean,
did she say something?

55:02.135 --> 55:04.302
<i>Nothing direct.
Just little comments,</i>

55:04.371 --> 55:05.770
<i>and she made a big deal</i>

55:05.806 --> 55:07.750
<i>about me giving you
the Hansen Candy report to do.</i>

55:07.774 --> 55:08.740
Well, I thought
you were out of town.

55:08.775 --> 55:10.709
I was,
and I could've handled it.

55:10.744 --> 55:13.356
But she kept saying
you were basically on vacation,

55:13.380 --> 55:14.490
and that you should
pick up the slack.

55:14.514 --> 55:15.847
Well, that's not good.

55:15.882 --> 55:18.294
I mean, she's basically the biggest
factor in me making Director.

55:18.318 --> 55:20.819
<i>Right?
So don't skip.</i>

55:20.854 --> 55:22.921
<i>Get Handsome Ben to help you.</i>

55:22.956 --> 55:24.756
I don't know about that.

55:24.791 --> 55:26.691
Why? I thought you guys
were co-captains.

55:26.727 --> 55:28.259
<i>- Well...
- Wait.</i>

55:28.295 --> 55:29.735
Did something happen
between you two?

55:30.731 --> 55:32.664
Something almost
happened between us,

55:32.699 --> 55:35.801
and then he pulled away,
so it didn't, and then it got weird.

55:38.305 --> 55:40.892
I think it's best if I do things
without Ben from now on.

55:44.811 --> 55:49.614
Ben, you're awfully quiet today.
What's on your mind?

55:50.817 --> 55:52.016
Nothing.

55:52.052 --> 55:55.220
Just thinking about... work,
and the contest tomorrow,

55:55.255 --> 55:56.721
and the Crawl.

55:56.757 --> 55:57.757
How's all that going?

55:58.859 --> 56:01.693
Fine. Great.
Amazing.

56:15.242 --> 56:17.275
That is such good news.

56:17.344 --> 56:19.210
<i>And Dr. Walsh said
I was doing so well,</i>

56:19.246 --> 56:20.411
<i>I could already use a cane.</i>

56:20.480 --> 56:23.414
That's wonderful.

56:24.551 --> 56:25.884
What was that?

56:28.588 --> 56:29.799
I just had to do
some last-minute shopping,

56:29.823 --> 56:32.290
get some extra
dough ingredients.

56:32.325 --> 56:33.491
How many extra?

56:33.560 --> 56:35.960
Just... a little bit.

56:36.029 --> 56:37.362
<i>Joy...</i>

56:37.397 --> 56:40.265
I can hear it in your tone
that something's wrong,

56:40.333 --> 56:43.068
so you might as well tell me
everything now, save us both the time.

56:44.237 --> 56:45.804
Boy, do I need time.

56:49.177 --> 56:50.543
Almost done.

56:50.579 --> 56:52.123
Just got to let this section
dry for a couple hours,

56:52.147 --> 56:53.224
and then it'll be ready
for the icing.

56:53.248 --> 56:55.582
Ruby just called.

56:55.617 --> 56:57.384
Why didn't you tell me
Joy had a problem

56:57.419 --> 57:00.053
with the cookie dough
freezer, hmm?

57:00.088 --> 57:02.123
- What, she didn't tell you?
- No.

57:03.191 --> 57:05.570
I thought you guys were
spending all this time together.

57:05.594 --> 57:07.861
I helped her get ready
for the Cookie Crawl.

57:07.896 --> 57:10.063
- How bad is it?
- Half of it's gone,

57:10.132 --> 57:12.510
and apparently, she's going
to stay up all night tonight.

57:12.534 --> 57:13.845
She can't possibly
handle all that by herself.

57:13.869 --> 57:15.502
No. She can't.

57:33.822 --> 57:38.091
- Word travels fast.
- And we're here to help, sweetie.

57:39.461 --> 57:40.961
Come on in.

57:42.597 --> 57:45.932
Hi.
Thank you for coming.

58:34.216 --> 58:36.416
Thank you guys so much
for all your hard work.

58:36.451 --> 58:38.184
I know you did it
for Aunt Ruby, but...

58:38.220 --> 58:41.388
- We did it for you and Ruby.
- I really appreciate it.

58:41.456 --> 58:43.390
I know.

58:43.458 --> 58:44.624
Well...

58:45.761 --> 58:48.528
- All right.
- Get some rest.

58:48.597 --> 58:49.597
Yeah.

58:53.769 --> 58:56.603
- Bye, Shirley.
- Bye, sweetie.

58:56.638 --> 58:57.737
Bye.

58:59.741 --> 59:01.841
Hey, Ben...

59:03.578 --> 59:05.812
- Thank you.
- Of course.

59:09.151 --> 59:11.518
- Look, about yesterday...
- It's okay.

59:11.586 --> 59:12.519
We got caught up in a moment,
it happens.

59:12.587 --> 59:13.620
But I made it awkward...

59:13.655 --> 59:15.321
Life gets awkward sometimes.
It's fine.

59:15.390 --> 59:16.390
Like now?

59:18.460 --> 59:19.926
See you tomorrow?

59:19.961 --> 59:22.729
- Cookies and gingerbread.
- Cookies and gingerbread.

59:25.534 --> 59:27.033
Thanks.

59:40.082 --> 59:44.851
- Are those...
- The voting boxes without voter bias.

59:44.886 --> 59:46.352
You can't see through them.

59:48.690 --> 59:50.356
I like it.

01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:08.441
<i>Gosh!</i>

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:12.045
<i>It looks wonderful.
Tell Joy thank you.</i>

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.782
Will do.

01:00:25.293 --> 01:00:29.195
Each person
gets one coin to vote with.

01:00:29.231 --> 01:00:31.731
Here you go.

01:00:33.235 --> 01:00:34.868
Grab one...

01:00:34.903 --> 01:00:36.870
Cast your vote.

01:00:39.207 --> 01:00:40.207
Wisely?

01:00:43.945 --> 01:00:46.813
- Joy?
- Excuse me.

01:00:54.856 --> 01:00:55.856
Check, check...

01:00:56.858 --> 01:00:59.859
Hi, everyone.
I'm Phil Finnegan,

01:00:59.895 --> 01:01:03.763
and I am thrilled
to officially welcome you all

01:01:03.798 --> 01:01:07.267
to Carolina's Best Flour's
Gingerbread Bake-Off!

01:01:12.641 --> 01:01:15.486
This year, the honor
of announcing the winners

01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:18.578
goes to our newest judge,
Joy Holbrook!

01:01:20.415 --> 01:01:21.514
Thanks, Phil.

01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:23.650
Thank you guys so much
for having me.

01:01:23.685 --> 01:01:26.519
You have all done
a wonderful job here.

01:01:26.555 --> 01:01:28.599
So, as you can see,
we went with a blind voting system,

01:01:28.623 --> 01:01:30.801
so I think the results will be
a little bit more of a surprise

01:01:30.825 --> 01:01:33.604
than you're used to.
But let's get down to business.

01:01:33.628 --> 01:01:37.197
Based on our secret ballots,
we've tallied all your votes,

01:01:37.232 --> 01:01:39.933
and I have
the top three winners here.

01:01:40.201 --> 01:01:45.135
Third prize goes to the Carolina
Panthers' stadium at Christmas.

01:01:49.978 --> 01:01:52.979
- Congratulations.
- Well done.

01:01:55.317 --> 01:01:57.584
Second prize goes to...

01:01:57.619 --> 01:01:59.385
the Christmas Carousel!

01:02:04.259 --> 01:02:06.392
Well done.

01:02:06.428 --> 01:02:07.827
And the winner

01:02:07.862 --> 01:02:12.432
of Carolina's Best Flour's
Gingerbread Bake-Off is...

01:02:12.467 --> 01:02:16.102
Santa's Workshop
among the trees!

01:02:17.272 --> 01:02:21.808
Brought to you by the mother-son duo
of Ben and Shirley Andrews.

01:02:28.283 --> 01:02:30.350
Victory photo!

01:02:30.385 --> 01:02:32.986
First-place winners, bravo!

01:02:33.989 --> 01:02:34.989
Got it.

01:02:36.725 --> 01:02:40.960
And now for the words
that everybody's been waiting for...

01:02:40.996 --> 01:02:42.662
time to eat!

01:02:47.469 --> 01:02:49.502
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

01:02:51.072 --> 01:02:54.140
- Look! Look at that.
- Well done! Congratulations.

01:02:54.175 --> 01:02:55.175
Thanks, Dad.

01:02:58.013 --> 01:02:59.156
Are you heading back to D.C.?

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:02.415
My company's Christmas Gala is tonight.
It's just five hours away.

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:03.650
After the gingerbread contest,

01:03:03.685 --> 01:03:05.551
and staying up all night
making cookie dough?

01:03:05.587 --> 01:03:06.907
I've been drinking
lots of coffee.

01:03:08.123 --> 01:03:09.734
Well, I just wanted
to come out and tell you

01:03:09.758 --> 01:03:10.935
you did a great job
with the judging.

01:03:10.959 --> 01:03:12.792
The blind voting idea
was a good one.

01:03:12.861 --> 01:03:13.861
Thank you.

01:03:13.895 --> 01:03:15.695
But Ashley really did
99% of the work.

01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:17.430
Now who's dazzling
with the data?

01:03:17.499 --> 01:03:18.831
That's what I do.

01:03:20.368 --> 01:03:21.801
I know you gotta
get out of here,

01:03:21.836 --> 01:03:23.536
this is just one thing.

01:03:24.839 --> 01:03:27.907
- What's this?
- It's just a Christmas present.

01:03:27.942 --> 01:03:31.411
Open it later.
You gotta get going, I know.

01:03:31.446 --> 01:03:33.546
I'm coming back
for the Cookie Crawl tomorrow.

01:03:33.581 --> 01:03:34.759
You could just
give it to me then.

01:03:34.783 --> 01:03:38.751
Just in case you decided to change
your mind and stay in D.C.

01:03:44.793 --> 01:03:45.958
Thank you.

01:03:50.231 --> 01:03:52.165
Well, drive safe.

01:04:15.326 --> 01:04:17.059
Ben!

01:04:17.094 --> 01:04:18.593
Hey, Dad.

01:04:18.629 --> 01:04:20.228
I saw you heading out this way.

01:04:20.264 --> 01:04:22.497
Whatcha doing?

01:04:22.533 --> 01:04:24.099
Thinkin'.

01:04:24.168 --> 01:04:27.135
About anything in particular?

01:04:27.171 --> 01:04:28.637
Joy.

01:04:30.374 --> 01:04:34.276
I'm guessing you mean the
young lady, not the emotion.

01:04:34.311 --> 01:04:37.112
Unless one brings the other.

01:04:37.147 --> 01:04:40.549
I feel like I'm setting myself up
for heartbreak.

01:04:40.584 --> 01:04:43.785
Well, that very well could be.

01:04:43.854 --> 01:04:44.854
I gotta say,

01:04:44.888 --> 01:04:48.357
you're not looking real happy
at this moment, either.

01:04:48.392 --> 01:04:50.459
But Joy lives in D.C.

01:04:50.494 --> 01:04:54.596
What if I'm getting myself right
back in the same kind of situation?

01:04:54.631 --> 01:04:56.898
Well, that's the risk.

01:04:56.934 --> 01:04:59.501
Anytime you put yourself out there,
there's always a risk.

01:04:59.570 --> 01:05:03.038
I know, Dad.
I know she's not Anne.

01:05:03.073 --> 01:05:05.841
Well then, if you like her
and you want her to know it,

01:05:05.876 --> 01:05:08.243
you gotta find her
and tell her, and...

01:05:08.278 --> 01:05:11.647
then wait and see if she'll
stick around for the long haul.

01:05:11.682 --> 01:05:16.151
Like everybody else.

01:05:16.186 --> 01:05:18.186
There are no shortcuts, Ben.

01:05:36.673 --> 01:05:38.507
Come on...

01:06:25.122 --> 01:06:27.489
Oh, Ben...

01:06:33.464 --> 01:06:34.663
Hey.

01:06:34.698 --> 01:06:35.530
<i>Hey, I'm downstairs in the car.</i>

01:06:35.566 --> 01:06:38.467
Okay, I'll be right down.
Sorry, traffic was crazy.

01:06:38.535 --> 01:06:39.846
I'll just, I have to
finish my hair in the car.

01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:41.203
See you soon.

01:07:17.307 --> 01:07:19.274
Joy, Renee,
it's good to see you.

01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:20.575
You too.

01:07:20.611 --> 01:07:22.491
Does this mean you're back
in D.C. for good now?

01:07:22.546 --> 01:07:24.279
I have to run back tomorrow.

01:07:24.348 --> 01:07:26.515
My aunt's getting
released from the hospital,

01:07:26.550 --> 01:07:27.849
and it's the Cookie Crawl.

01:07:27.885 --> 01:07:29.851
Isn't that what you've been
doing the entire time?

01:07:29.887 --> 01:07:31.720
I've been preparing
for the Crawl.

01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:35.090
How lovely.

01:07:35.159 --> 01:07:37.560
Sure. That's great.
Excuse me.

01:07:39.530 --> 01:07:40.962
Mrs. Weatherton,
how are you?

01:07:40.998 --> 01:07:42.108
Hey, did you ever hear
what was going on

01:07:42.132 --> 01:07:43.309
with the Weatherton's account?

01:07:43.333 --> 01:07:46.334
No, but Fran in Margie's office said

01:07:46.403 --> 01:07:48.515
they weren't even sure Poppy
was gonna show up tonight.

01:07:48.539 --> 01:07:51.873
- That's not good.
- Well, at least she's here.

01:07:51.909 --> 01:07:54.609
And you, too!

01:07:54.678 --> 01:07:55.755
It's nice to see
your pretty face

01:07:55.779 --> 01:07:57.512
on something other
than a monitor.

01:07:57.548 --> 01:07:58.647
You too.

01:07:58.682 --> 01:07:59.881
Now let's go to the bar,

01:07:59.917 --> 01:08:03.051
and you can tell me all about
what's going on with Ben.

01:08:11.962 --> 01:08:14.429
Thank you.

01:08:14.464 --> 01:08:17.666
- I knew that dress was perfect.
- Mrs. Weatherton...

01:08:17.701 --> 01:08:19.568
I called your office last week.

01:08:19.603 --> 01:08:23.205
They said you were out of town,
in North Carolina?

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.439
Yes, ma'am.

01:08:24.474 --> 01:08:26.841
- Crystal Falls?
- I know that place.

01:08:26.877 --> 01:08:29.844
- You do?
- Yes, I have family in Charlotte.

01:08:29.912 --> 01:08:31.246
What brought you there?

01:08:31.281 --> 01:08:33.747
I was helping my aunt
with the town Cookie Crawl.

01:08:33.783 --> 01:08:35.149
The...

01:08:35.219 --> 01:08:37.685
I'm sorry, did you say
you called the office for me?

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:38.886
Yes.

01:08:38.921 --> 01:08:40.755
If your office
is anything like ours,

01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:42.202
I'm sure you've heard
some gossip lately.

01:08:42.225 --> 01:08:45.527
I came here in part tonight
to let you know

01:08:45.562 --> 01:08:48.395
that there are going to be
some changes starting in January,

01:08:48.465 --> 01:08:51.332
and I want you to know

01:08:51.368 --> 01:08:54.803
that I valued your input
in our account over the years,

01:08:54.837 --> 01:08:58.773
even when you didn't get
the... obvious credit.

01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:03.379
Thank you, so much.
That means a lot to me.

01:09:04.781 --> 01:09:08.383
- Cookie Crawl?
- Cookie Crawl.

01:09:08.417 --> 01:09:11.786
My imagination is...
running wild.

01:09:19.930 --> 01:09:21.263
Okay, let's go.

01:09:21.298 --> 01:09:23.698
Of course, Mrs. Weatherton.
This way.

01:09:23.734 --> 01:09:25.868
- Have you ever head of a Cookie Crawl?
- I have not.

01:09:25.902 --> 01:09:26.734
Look it up for me, would you?

01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:29.270
Joy!
What did Poppy Weatherton say?

01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:32.073
She just wanted to thank me
for working on her account.

01:09:32.142 --> 01:09:33.174
What's going on?

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:37.545
Okay, you can't say anything yet,
but we lost Weatherton's.

01:09:37.613 --> 01:09:40.154
- What?
- I just found out for certain...

01:09:40.183 --> 01:09:41.783
which means that
I'm going to need to you

01:09:41.818 --> 01:09:43.229
to work double-time
starting tomorrow.

01:09:43.252 --> 01:09:44.752
I can't tomorrow.

01:09:44.787 --> 01:09:47.000
My aunt comes home,
and then we have the Cookie Crawl.

01:09:47.024 --> 01:09:50.558
Joy, we just lost
one of our biggest clients.

01:09:50.594 --> 01:09:55.497
We can't waste any time finding
a way to replace that revenue.

01:09:55.532 --> 01:09:58.199
- I promised my aunt.
- She'll understand.

01:09:58.235 --> 01:09:59.235
I won't.

01:10:00.637 --> 01:10:04.139
Joy, just...
I want you to think about things.

01:10:04.174 --> 01:10:06.975
Now, they haven't announced
the promotions yet.

01:10:09.046 --> 01:10:12.013
- What are you saying?
- Just be smart about this.

01:10:12.049 --> 01:10:13.548
This is your career.

01:10:13.583 --> 01:10:17.085
Now, you could very well be
busier than you have ever been.

01:10:17.154 --> 01:10:19.054
I already pour so much
of my time into this job,

01:10:19.122 --> 01:10:20.700
that I barely see my friends
or my aunt as it is...

01:10:20.724 --> 01:10:23.024
- Joy...
- I'm sorry, Margie.

01:10:23.093 --> 01:10:24.570
If it's a couple of days
that you need, I...

01:10:24.594 --> 01:10:26.795
No. Thank you, though.

01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:29.230
You know, I've been dreaming
of this Christmas Gala

01:10:29.266 --> 01:10:30.231
for so long,

01:10:30.267 --> 01:10:33.735
and now that I'm here, I just...
I feel so disconnected.

01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:36.204
- All I wanna be is...
- In Crystal Falls?

01:10:38.942 --> 01:10:41.643
It's my home.

01:10:42.746 --> 01:10:44.813
I will let the partners know.

01:10:44.848 --> 01:10:48.850
Thank you.
For so many things.

01:10:48.919 --> 01:10:51.619
Joy...

01:10:58.962 --> 01:11:00.495
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:03.164
- I think I just quit my job.
- You did not.

01:11:04.301 --> 01:11:05.500
Cheers.

01:11:38.235 --> 01:11:40.869
- Cheers!
- What?

01:11:40.904 --> 01:11:42.704
- Oh, my gosh...
- I'm a free woman.

01:11:42.739 --> 01:11:44.150
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

01:11:44.174 --> 01:11:47.153
Hey, we need more
champagne from the back.

01:11:47.177 --> 01:11:49.711
- Excuse me?
- Champagne. From the back.

01:11:49.746 --> 01:11:50.746
Come on.

01:12:11.868 --> 01:12:13.535
Can you excuse me
for just a second?

01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:15.503
Yeah.

01:12:21.011 --> 01:12:22.011
Excuse me.

01:12:48.839 --> 01:12:50.016
<i>Hi. You've reached
Ben Andrews.</i>

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.473
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:13:08.825 --> 01:13:11.059
Can you grab my car, please?

01:13:16.382 --> 01:13:17.969
I'm doing it.

01:13:21.273 --> 01:13:22.639
Yup...

01:13:22.675 --> 01:13:25.842
Thanks to the helping hands
of friends and family,

01:13:25.911 --> 01:13:28.212
we have five tables set up
for the Cookie Crawl.

01:13:35.521 --> 01:13:38.722
- So... when can I see?
- Soon.

01:13:38.757 --> 01:13:41.525
We've still got a bit of work to do,
but we'll get it done.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.060
Yes, we will.

01:13:47.333 --> 01:13:49.499
So, when are the Andrews clan
coming over tonight?

01:13:49.568 --> 01:13:51.468
I'm not sure.

01:13:51.503 --> 01:13:54.404
I haven't heard back
from Ben yet.

01:13:55.474 --> 01:13:56.474
What's going on?

01:13:58.043 --> 01:13:59.710
I don't know.

01:13:59.745 --> 01:14:02.557
We worked together great
on the gingerbread competition,

01:14:02.581 --> 01:14:04.681
and then he pulled back,

01:14:04.717 --> 01:14:06.494
and then he showed up
at the MacDonald Webber Gala.

01:14:06.518 --> 01:14:08.652
- In D.C.?
- Yes!

01:14:08.687 --> 01:14:10.821
But he left
before I could talk to him,

01:14:10.856 --> 01:14:13.590
and it's just been
radio silence ever since.

01:14:13.626 --> 01:14:16.893
- That doesn't seem like Ben.
- I know.

01:14:16.929 --> 01:14:18.573
So, I don't know what to do
about the Cookie Crawl.

01:14:18.597 --> 01:14:20.631
That'll take care of itself.

01:14:20.699 --> 01:14:22.332
The important thing is
how you're doing.

01:14:25.571 --> 01:14:28.038
- I don't like feeling like this.
- Vulnerable?

01:14:29.174 --> 01:14:30.207
Yeah.

01:14:30.276 --> 01:14:32.976
Love makes us vulnerable.

01:14:33.012 --> 01:14:34.611
And I am pleased as punch

01:14:34.647 --> 01:14:36.327
that you're feeling that way
about someone.

01:14:37.549 --> 01:14:40.284
- Ben is a good one.
- Then why won't he call me back?

01:14:42.087 --> 01:14:44.622
That's up to you to figure out
before you leave.

01:14:45.724 --> 01:14:47.824
About that.

01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:49.059
How would you feel

01:14:49.094 --> 01:14:50.794
about having a roommate
for a little while?

01:14:52.231 --> 01:14:55.299
- Are you considering...
- Making some changes in my life,

01:14:55.334 --> 01:14:57.301
and making time
for the people I love.

01:15:00.005 --> 01:15:02.472
I think that would be
the greatest Christmas gift

01:15:02.541 --> 01:15:03.573
that you could give me.

01:15:12.751 --> 01:15:13.751
Hello!

01:15:13.819 --> 01:15:15.118
I bought a new one

01:15:15.154 --> 01:15:16.331
so I thought I'd bring back
your old snow shovel...

01:15:16.355 --> 01:15:18.566
- Why aren't you calling Joy back?
- And good morning, Mom.

01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:20.657
Ruby's home, and she said

01:15:20.693 --> 01:15:21.803
that Joy has been trying
to get ahold of you,

01:15:21.827 --> 01:15:22.726
and you are not responding.

01:15:22.761 --> 01:15:25.307
- Mom, let me handle it.
- Except you're not handling it.

01:15:25.331 --> 01:15:26.463
I'll make it a point

01:15:26.532 --> 01:15:28.231
to say goodbye
before she goes back to D.C.

01:15:28.267 --> 01:15:30.245
Well, that shows how little you know.
She's staying.

01:15:30.269 --> 01:15:31.601
What?

01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:33.103
Yeah.

01:15:33.172 --> 01:15:34.738
In Crystal Falls.

01:15:34.807 --> 01:15:36.740
It seems she turned down
some big promotion,

01:15:36.809 --> 01:15:38.775
and decided to move
back home for a bit.

01:15:38.811 --> 01:15:40.677
Why?

01:15:40.713 --> 01:15:43.980
You'll have to
ask her that yourself.

01:16:00.433 --> 01:16:01.565
Careful.

01:16:02.902 --> 01:16:05.503
- Just a couple more steps.
- Okay.

01:16:09.976 --> 01:16:11.542
Ta-dah!

01:16:17.150 --> 01:16:21.252
It's like Mother Nature came
and decorated it herself.

01:16:21.287 --> 01:16:22.620
That's what I was going for.

01:16:22.688 --> 01:16:24.688
We're serving two kinds
of hot chocolate.

01:16:24.724 --> 01:16:26.691
- Regular and...
- And one with kick,

01:16:26.726 --> 01:16:28.592
like Emma used to make for you.

01:16:28.661 --> 01:16:32.163
Joy, it is just perfect.

01:16:32.198 --> 01:16:36.000
- Perfect.
- Good. I'm glad you're happy.

01:16:36.035 --> 01:16:37.668
I love it.

01:16:45.044 --> 01:16:46.410
By the way,

01:16:46.445 --> 01:16:49.613
I found out what
Twyla Taft's theme is.

01:16:50.716 --> 01:16:52.483
"Chocolate Chip".

01:16:52.518 --> 01:16:54.084
That's it?

01:16:55.221 --> 01:16:56.365
It's like
she wasn't even trying.

01:16:56.389 --> 01:16:59.657
I almost feel bad
how good ours is.

01:16:59.692 --> 01:17:01.859
Almost.

01:17:09.035 --> 01:17:11.068
Here we go!

01:17:14.607 --> 01:17:15.873
Come on.

01:17:18.711 --> 01:17:19.711
Make yourselves at home.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.581
Come on in.

01:17:25.084 --> 01:17:27.952
Welcome!
Good to see you.

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.140
Excuse me.

01:17:50.176 --> 01:17:51.742
You made it!

01:17:51.777 --> 01:17:54.111
There was no way
I was going to miss this.

01:17:56.082 --> 01:17:57.114
- Where is he?
- Who?

01:17:57.183 --> 01:17:58.449
Ben!

01:18:00.119 --> 01:18:02.331
I'm not sure he's going to make it.
I haven't seen him yet.

01:18:02.355 --> 01:18:06.190
- Well, the night's not over yet.
- Okay.

01:18:07.827 --> 01:18:09.126
Hi, everyone!

01:18:10.763 --> 01:18:13.831
It's so great to see you all.

01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:16.333
I just wanted
to take this moment to say...

01:18:16.402 --> 01:18:20.437
thank you to Joy,
for all her hard work

01:18:20.473 --> 01:18:22.006
so we could all celebrate
this night.

01:18:23.409 --> 01:18:24.975
Thank you.

01:18:25.011 --> 01:18:27.177
As you were.

01:18:30.182 --> 01:18:31.382
Ben made this for me.

01:18:31.450 --> 01:18:34.451
That reminds me of the one
that Emma gave you.

01:18:34.487 --> 01:18:38.155
- I love it.
- I do, too.

01:18:40.559 --> 01:18:41.725
Excuse me.

01:18:41.761 --> 01:18:44.094
So, this is a Cookie Crawl.

01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:47.531
Mrs. Weatherton, what...
what are you doing here?

01:18:47.566 --> 01:18:49.300
I was over in Charlotte,
and I got curious.

01:18:51.037 --> 01:18:52.803
It really is extraordinary.

01:18:52.838 --> 01:18:55.941
A lot of people worked very hard
to make this happen.

01:18:56.842 --> 01:18:59.843
- But you took point, didn't you?
- I did.

01:18:59.912 --> 01:19:00.778
I thought as much.

01:19:00.813 --> 01:19:02.646
You probably know by now

01:19:02.715 --> 01:19:05.082
I've taken Weatherton's
market research out

01:19:05.117 --> 01:19:06.684
from MacDonald-Webber.

01:19:06.719 --> 01:19:08.185
Margie mentioned it to me.

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:09.753
What she likely didn't mention

01:19:09.822 --> 01:19:13.524
is that I've decided to create
an in-house marketing division,

01:19:13.559 --> 01:19:16.695
and I would love for you to be
part of the leadership team.

01:19:17.697 --> 01:19:19.964
- Me?
- Yes. If you're interested.

01:19:19.999 --> 01:19:23.100
Of course, that would likely
entail a move on your part

01:19:23.135 --> 01:19:25.569
since I'm opening a new store

01:19:25.604 --> 01:19:27.471
and new corporate offices
in Charlotte.

01:19:28.641 --> 01:19:31.241
But something tells me
you won't mind.

01:19:31.277 --> 01:19:36.380
I do hope you'll call me
on January 2nd to discuss.

01:19:37.917 --> 01:19:39.116
Thank you.

01:19:40.653 --> 01:19:42.987
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm dying for a ginger snap.

01:19:43.022 --> 01:19:44.022
Enjoy.

01:20:11.484 --> 01:20:12.484
Oh, my.

01:20:15.254 --> 01:20:18.522
You're here.
I wasn't sure if...

01:20:18.557 --> 01:20:20.057
I am co-captain.

01:20:20.092 --> 01:20:23.360
It's as much your doing
as anyone else's.

01:20:23.396 --> 01:20:25.863
You brought everything
together so nicely.

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.840
I'm sorry I wasn't here
for the last part.

01:20:31.904 --> 01:20:33.570
But you were in D.C., right?

01:20:37.977 --> 01:20:39.657
So why did you leave
without talking to me?

01:20:41.213 --> 01:20:42.880
You looked so beautiful
in that dress.

01:20:44.583 --> 01:20:46.350
And the way you fit in
with that world,

01:20:46.385 --> 01:20:49.053
I never could do that.

01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:52.456
And I got scared.

01:20:55.394 --> 01:20:58.162
But I'd like to try again,
if you'll let me.

01:21:01.067 --> 01:21:02.900
Maybe this time without the tux.

01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:07.171
I liked the tux,
it was a nice touch.

01:21:07.206 --> 01:21:09.206
- I liked that dress.
- You did?

01:21:09.241 --> 01:21:10.474
You looked beautiful.

01:21:13.145 --> 01:21:16.747
So, Joy Holbrook,
will you go to dinner with me?

01:21:16.782 --> 01:21:18.315
Crystal Falls Lodge?

01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:20.617
It's not just for proms
and Sweet 16 parties.

01:21:20.653 --> 01:21:23.455
- I think that can be arranged.
- Can it?

01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:26.757
Turns out, I have a lot
of arranging to do.

01:21:26.792 --> 01:21:28.926
I'm going to be
starting a new job

01:21:28.994 --> 01:21:31.829
with Weatherton's office,
in Charlotte.

01:21:33.466 --> 01:21:34.698
That's commuting distance.

01:21:34.733 --> 01:21:38.802
Which is a good thing,
since I plan to be in Crystal Falls

01:21:38.838 --> 01:21:40.437
for a very long time.

01:21:41.774 --> 01:21:42.774
Are you sure?

01:21:44.643 --> 01:21:46.977
Took me a little while
to realize it, but...

01:21:47.046 --> 01:21:49.613
"When you pick out
anything by itself... "

01:21:49.682 --> 01:21:51.548
"... you find it hitched
to everything else".

01:21:51.584 --> 01:21:53.850
And I'm hitched here.
