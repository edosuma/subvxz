WEBVTT

00:02.524 --> 00:03.829
Previously onDynasty...Marry me again.

00:03.873 --> 00:05.657
Hell yes.

00:05.701 --> 00:07.529
All the Carrington money
and influence in the world

00:07.572 --> 00:09.139
cannot change the fact
that I am innocent.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.314
BLAKE:
For some insane reason,

00:10.358 --> 00:11.620
you hired divers
to find Fallon's ring.

00:11.663 --> 00:13.578
I didn't know there were
two bodies in the lake.

00:13.622 --> 00:15.015
BLAKE:
Figure out some way
to make sure

00:15.058 --> 00:17.582
that my DNA is not all over
Mack's dead body.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.323
To a fruitful partnership.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.977
I really am glad
you're here, though.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.632
What's going on?
I'm getting kicked out?

00:23.675 --> 00:25.764
ADAM:
Obviously, I had nothing to do
with Liam's accident.

00:27.679 --> 00:28.941
You know,
not everything's my fault.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.813
I don't forget things.
And you will pay.

00:30.856 --> 00:33.381
You are under arrest for
the murder of Nathan Macintosh.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.383
Ashley?Laura called me.

00:35.426 --> 00:36.645
That's Liam's mom.Yes,

00:36.688 --> 00:37.776
I know who Laura is.

00:38.603 --> 00:39.822
Liam.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.650
I'm sorry. Who are you?

00:41.693 --> 00:42.825
What?

00:51.529 --> 00:54.489
♪ Do what they say,
say what they mean ♪

00:54.532 --> 00:56.839
♪ Baby, one thing
leads to another ♪

00:56.882 --> 01:00.321
♪ You tell me something wrong,
I know I listen too long ♪

01:00.364 --> 01:03.715
♪ But then one thing
leads to another... ♪

01:03.759 --> 01:06.109
Your sentencing hearing
is in 48 hours.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.806
Judge Anson is tough.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.286
Well, shouldn't he
be lenient?

01:09.330 --> 01:11.288
I mean, I told
the police the truth

01:11.332 --> 01:13.377
about what happened
the night Trixie died.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.814
I mean, yes,
I lied about it ten years ago.

01:15.858 --> 01:17.381
And again the other day.

01:17.425 --> 01:20.123
But if it's the same lie,
does it technically count twice?

01:20.167 --> 01:22.125
We're kind of having a meeting.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.735
I'll chew softly.

01:23.779 --> 01:25.433
The judge's decision
could go either way.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.304
What, you mean, like,

01:27.348 --> 01:30.002
the death penalty
or life without parole?

01:30.046 --> 01:31.482
Not helpful.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.136
And could you please close
your robe

01:33.180 --> 01:34.920
and put the judge
back in chambers?

01:34.964 --> 01:37.140
As you were saying?

01:37.184 --> 01:39.577
Best-case scenario,
you get a slap on the wrist

01:39.621 --> 01:41.318
and some probation,
but if the judge

01:41.362 --> 01:43.625
wants to make an example
of a spoiled rich kid

01:43.668 --> 01:45.453
who's always gotten
away with everything,

01:45.496 --> 01:47.890
you could be looking
at five years or more.

01:47.933 --> 01:49.283
No offense.

01:49.326 --> 01:52.286
I'm not sure there's a way
that's not offensive.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.765
I'll see you in a few days.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.811
Ooh.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.247
Why aren't you more
freaked out?

01:57.291 --> 01:59.771
I mean, if there's even a chance
you're going to jail,

01:59.815 --> 02:03.732
you should be... getting a
hard-core mani-pedi and facial.

02:03.775 --> 02:06.169
Or you could flee the country,
but in that case,

02:06.213 --> 02:08.258
I would wax everything.

02:08.302 --> 02:11.783
I am accepting the consequences
of my actions, remember?

02:11.827 --> 02:15.657
And I am not painting or waxing
anything in the next 48 hours.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.268
I need to use that time to
smack the amnesia out of Liam

02:18.312 --> 02:21.010
and to make him remember that
he loves me and not Trashley.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.794
And that way, if
I do go to jail,

02:22.838 --> 02:24.796
I'll have my fiancé waiting
for me when I get out.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.103
It'll be a love story
for the ages.
Right.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.149
See you later.Bye.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.153
Did Fallon just say
that Liam has amnesia?

02:34.806 --> 02:37.287
Good morning to you... Adam.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.855
You know, you shouldn't
walk into rooms

02:39.898 --> 02:41.465
asking questions like that.

02:41.509 --> 02:44.338
It makes you seem
weird... er.
Huh.

02:46.035 --> 02:47.732
What's going on?

02:47.776 --> 02:49.169
Breaking ground.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.649
You are aware that
construction has begun?

02:51.693 --> 02:54.826
Yes, but I want to document
the beginning of the new hotel,

02:54.870 --> 02:56.263
so we're faking it.

02:56.306 --> 02:57.742
It's called creative license.

02:57.786 --> 02:59.179
And that explains the camera.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.703
Exactly. Also...

03:01.746 --> 03:05.097
renovation progress kills
on social media, so, incoming.

03:16.674 --> 03:19.460
Oh, my God, did we
just find treasure?

03:19.503 --> 03:21.679
ANDERS:
It could be
Al Capone's vault.

03:21.723 --> 03:23.290
Unfamiliar with
the reference.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.682
ANDERS:
There's a painting here.

03:24.726 --> 03:27.685
"Bernard McCarty, 1923."

03:27.729 --> 03:29.383
Someone you grew up with?

03:29.426 --> 03:31.036
Hilarious.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.822
Let's pile it all up, and I'll
have the dumpster wheeled in.

03:33.865 --> 03:36.216
Sam, hang on. This-this could be
a significant find.

03:36.259 --> 03:39.306
This Bernard McCarty could be
an important figure.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.743
I'm going to call
the Atlanta Historic Alliance.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.179
They're going to want
to investigate this.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.964
Well, that investigation
cannot delay construction.

03:46.008 --> 03:48.837
I've already sent out all the
invites for our grand reopening,

03:48.880 --> 03:50.491
and I can't push it back.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.232
I booked Hootie & the Blowfish.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.146
And if I have to settle
for a cover band,

03:54.190 --> 03:55.713
then it basically
becomes a quinceañera,

03:55.757 --> 03:58.150
and then we might as well
just burn the whole thing down.

03:58.194 --> 03:59.413
It won't be an issue.

03:59.456 --> 04:02.764
Trust me,
you're doing the right thing.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.026
How are they treating you?
What do you need?

04:04.069 --> 04:05.462
Tell me. I'll get it
for you immediately.

04:05.506 --> 04:08.117
I've been in here,
like, an hour.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.945
All right?
Relax, both of you.

04:09.988 --> 04:11.120
This will be over soon.

04:11.163 --> 04:13.122
Right now we need
to focus on business.

04:13.165 --> 04:14.645
The board
of Blue Belt Vineyards

04:14.689 --> 04:16.604
received a substantial offer
last week,

04:16.647 --> 04:18.388
and I know they're
considering accepting it

04:18.432 --> 04:20.825
because of my temporary
incapacitation.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.262
They can't sell it without you.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.568
They can if I'm not there
to vote against it.

04:24.612 --> 04:25.830
Blue Belt Vineyards was

04:25.874 --> 04:27.571
the first company
I ever acquired.

04:27.615 --> 04:30.792
It has a tremendous amount
of sentimental value to me.

04:30.835 --> 04:34.317
I farmed her land,
I nurtured her grapes.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.536
Really?

04:35.579 --> 04:37.320
No!

04:37.364 --> 04:38.887
I paid people
to do that.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.628
But every time
I acquired another company,

04:40.671 --> 04:42.804
I toasted myself
from her oaky barrels.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.762
That company is in my blood.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.547
Also, it's my last
major holding.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.201
So I need both of you

04:49.245 --> 04:51.203
to represent me
to that board

04:51.247 --> 04:52.857
and put a cork in that sale.

04:52.901 --> 04:55.512
I have been on the phone
screaming

04:55.556 --> 04:56.774
at the district
attorney.

04:56.818 --> 04:59.037
Your bail hearing
won't be for two days.

04:59.081 --> 05:00.343
He has to stay here

05:00.387 --> 05:02.040
for two more days?Not ideal.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.520
MITCHELL:
You should also know

05:03.564 --> 05:06.480
that your DNA was found
inside Mack's body bag.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.743
Adam, I thought
you took care of that!

05:08.786 --> 05:10.962
Bag? What bag?
Th-There wasn't a bag.

05:11.006 --> 05:12.790
Uh, it-it wasn't
in that room.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.270
Should I really
be hearing this?

05:14.314 --> 05:16.794
I'll do everything I can,
but this is a murder case.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.361
The stakes are higher.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.928
This is unbelievable.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.712
Oh, you think I'm
happy about this?

05:21.756 --> 05:23.888
Both of you need
to keep a low profile

05:23.932 --> 05:25.368
if you want
to help Blake.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.022
The less press,
the better.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.284
Yeah.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.851
But I heard
someone in your family

05:29.894 --> 05:31.287
has lined up
an interview already.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.334
What? Who?

05:34.377 --> 05:36.379
Dominique.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.685
Ah, Cristal.

05:37.728 --> 05:40.383
I was literally
about to call you.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.124
I've been so worried
about Blake.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.995
I didn't come
to talk about Blake.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.823
I came to talk about you.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.303
Oh.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.000
My favorite topic.

05:49.044 --> 05:51.394
I heard you scheduled
an interview with TMZ

05:51.438 --> 05:52.787
to talk about
the case.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.484
Really more to talk about Jeff.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.138
I want you to cancel it.

05:56.181 --> 05:57.400
Do you?

05:57.444 --> 05:59.446
The less publicity about this,
the better.

05:59.489 --> 06:02.187
Blake needs to look like
a Boy Scout right now.

06:02.231 --> 06:05.974
Cristal, you know I would never
say anything to hurt my family.

06:06.017 --> 06:08.150
Here's what I know, Dominique.

06:08.193 --> 06:10.500
You are not
the family spokesperson.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.806
In fact,

06:11.849 --> 06:13.198
you're barely
family at all.

06:13.242 --> 06:14.678
Says the girlfriend.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.854
You will cancel the interview?

06:18.378 --> 06:20.162
Otherwise, those secret payoffs

06:20.205 --> 06:22.512
that Blake's been giving you
may stop arriving.

06:24.993 --> 06:29.084
I suppose the police are doing
everything they can for Jeff.

06:30.912 --> 06:32.914
I knew we'd come
to an agreement.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.662
It's Dominique Deveraux.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.838
I need to cancel my interview.

06:43.881 --> 06:46.318
I'm going to get you
something even juicier

06:46.362 --> 06:47.972
on my half-brother.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.195
Kirby?

06:53.238 --> 06:54.979
Oh. Hi, Dad.

06:55.023 --> 06:58.113
Um, I'm just here
to use the gym.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.855
I'm working on my fitness
and all that.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.204
Well, as you probably guessed,

07:02.247 --> 07:04.554
the-the gym's closed
for renovations.

07:05.599 --> 07:07.078
Oh.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.777
And since when have you
been a fitness junkie?

07:09.820 --> 07:11.779
Okay, fine.
I hate fitness.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.476
I just need a place to shower,

07:13.520 --> 07:15.130
because I've been sleeping
at Femperial

07:15.173 --> 07:17.785
since I got kicked out of the
manor, which is totally chill,

07:17.828 --> 07:20.962
but a-a janitor walked in on me
giving myself a sponge bath.

07:22.529 --> 07:25.923
Not one word you just
said sounds... "chill."

07:25.967 --> 07:27.621
Oh, it's-it's fine.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.492
It's all great fodder
for the memoir

07:29.536 --> 07:32.756
I'm gonna write one day
and publish myself.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.542
I was under the impression
that you had somewhere to stay.

07:35.585 --> 07:36.978
What happened?

07:37.021 --> 07:39.676
Um, yeah, I did plan
on going to Culhane's.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.809
Um, that didn't
really work out.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.114
Of course it didn't.

07:43.158 --> 07:45.116
It was a spectacularly
bad idea.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.553
Excuse me?

07:46.596 --> 07:48.511
You know how fond
I am of Michael,

07:48.555 --> 07:50.339
but he's in jail, Kirby.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.559
Does your life really need
that sort of complication?

07:52.602 --> 07:55.300
Might I remind you that
I'm dating that complication?

07:55.344 --> 07:57.346
It's my prerogative
to move in with him.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.609
You're going to come
and live with me.

07:59.653 --> 08:02.612
My new place has an
excellent spare room.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.396
I'm not a child.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.529
I don't need to live
with my father.

08:06.573 --> 08:09.445
In fact, I think Culhane's
will work out just fine.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.797
FALLON:
And you have to
remember this day.

08:13.841 --> 08:16.191
I mean, our tennis match
was a little intense,

08:16.234 --> 08:18.498
but then we had
the most intimate

08:18.541 --> 08:20.064
pillow fort conversation.

08:20.108 --> 08:22.545
It was actually one
of the best days we ever had.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.808
And this one--
you and I were...Fallon.

08:24.852 --> 08:27.202
All right, I believe we had
a relationship. I do.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.205
I mean, how else
do you explain that?

08:31.293 --> 08:32.903
Who even took that?

08:32.947 --> 08:34.992
Not important. Wait.

08:35.036 --> 08:37.647
So you're saying you remember
we had a relationship?

08:37.691 --> 08:40.607
Because we did, and it was...

08:40.650 --> 08:42.826
it was magical,
and it was true love.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.480
It-it istrue love.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.483
I also know that
when we broke up,

08:47.527 --> 08:49.311
you went a little
crazy when you heard

08:49.354 --> 08:50.704
me and Ashley were
dating again.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.793
Ashley told you that?
Is she here?

08:52.836 --> 08:55.360
Because I'd just... I'd like
to have a word with her,

08:55.404 --> 08:56.797
or maybe a heated argument.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.973
Ashley didn't
tell me anything.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.322
She went back to New York

09:00.365 --> 09:02.280
to grab some of her
stuff to bring back.

09:02.324 --> 09:04.456
Well, maybe she should
bring back the truth,

09:04.500 --> 09:05.806
because I never went crazy,

09:05.849 --> 09:07.808
and you and Ashley
never dated again.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.984
I mean, you don't remember it
that way, do you?

09:10.027 --> 09:12.334
Where would you even
get an idea like that?

09:12.377 --> 09:14.597
Fallon.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.686
What a treat.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.732
Lovely to see you again.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.299
I assume that you're here

09:21.343 --> 09:24.607
to prod Liam
into remembering you, huh?

09:24.651 --> 09:25.826
So, is it working?

09:25.869 --> 09:27.784
Well, he remembers
that I'm not a psycho,

09:27.828 --> 09:30.439
despite your best efforts
to paint me as one.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.615
Did you show him
a picture of the time

09:32.659 --> 09:35.531
that you followed him to
Sun Valley and bludgeoned Ashley

09:35.575 --> 09:37.315
in an effort
to steal him back?

09:37.359 --> 09:39.970
Or the time that you bought
the entire publishing company

09:40.014 --> 09:43.670
and tried to quash the release
of his beautiful book?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.715
No, I'm guessing
you did not bring pictures

09:45.759 --> 09:47.804
of those
less touching memories.

09:47.848 --> 09:51.155
I thought I'd just keep it
to the greatest hits.

09:51.199 --> 09:53.288
Liam, I'm going.

09:53.331 --> 09:56.552
I will be back
when Mother Superior is gone.

09:59.033 --> 10:01.035
Well, I'm not wild
about the decor,

10:01.078 --> 10:02.776
but I appreciate
the single cell.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.429
Give my thanks to the warden.

10:13.569 --> 10:15.049
Huh.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.877
Culhane.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.706
Of all the prison cells
in all the towns

10:19.749 --> 10:21.708
in all the world,

10:21.751 --> 10:24.232
you walk into mine.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.669
That is where
you're wrong, Blake.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.065
You just walked into mine.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.615
I guess there are
no singles in jail.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.662
Except solitary confinement,
which seems less fun.

11:02.705 --> 11:05.012
How fitting is this?

11:05.055 --> 11:07.884
A lifetime of cheating,
treachery and backstabbing

11:07.928 --> 11:10.321
finally lands you
where you belong.

11:10.365 --> 11:12.889
Suddenly, solitary confinement
doesn't seem so bad.

11:12.933 --> 11:15.109
There's a whole lot
of angry people in here.

11:15.152 --> 11:17.198
Most of them feel like
they've been screwed over

11:17.241 --> 11:20.157
by a system that favors
the one percent.

11:20.201 --> 11:21.419
You,

11:21.463 --> 11:24.727
you're the one percent
of the one percent.

11:24.771 --> 11:27.382
Which means they hate
the Carringtons most of all.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.429
Might be too early to vote
for Most Likely to Be Shivved,

11:31.473 --> 11:35.520
but I'm willing to bet
you will run away with it.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.176
You know, you can badmouth me
all you want,

11:39.220 --> 11:41.526
but as soon
as I get bail,

11:41.570 --> 11:43.746
I'll be out of
this prison suit

11:43.790 --> 11:48.185
and into my Tom Ford
pinstripe suit... like that.

11:48.229 --> 11:50.057
But don't you worry.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.755
I'll be happy to send you
a selfie of my fabulous life

11:52.799 --> 11:55.410
on the outside.

11:55.453 --> 11:58.152
You just found all this
here, behind the wall?

11:58.195 --> 11:59.240
Yes.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.502
Yes. We haven't
touched a thing.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.678
How much do you think
we can get for it?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.854
Oh, no.
From here on out,

12:04.898 --> 12:09.337
this is all under the purview of
the Atlanta Historical Alliance.

12:09.380 --> 12:12.906
This hotel is a Real McCarty.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.995
Yeah, I'm not following.

12:15.038 --> 12:19.826
Well, it appears this building
was designed by Bernard McCarty.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.828
Who, as you must know,

12:21.871 --> 12:24.744
helped put the city
of Atlanta on the map.

12:24.787 --> 12:28.791
A prolific architect
who later became a city planner.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.793
And honestly,

12:30.837 --> 12:33.535
there's even something
ruggedly dashing about him.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.494
Assuming this all checks out,

12:36.538 --> 12:38.801
your building
will be designated

12:38.845 --> 12:41.804
a historical landmark,
with a plaque

12:41.848 --> 12:44.807
and all the commemorative
fixings we have available.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.984
Uh, I don't mean to
pooh-pooh your fixings,

12:48.028 --> 12:50.160
but I paid an enormous amount
of money for this place.

12:50.204 --> 12:51.945
You can't just
turn it into a museum.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.730
Oh, oh, they're not gonna
turn it into a museum, Sam.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.210
They just want
to mark the spot

12:56.253 --> 12:58.212
as an important
place in history.

12:58.255 --> 13:01.824
Well, in order to authorize
landmark status,

13:01.868 --> 13:03.870
we need to bring in
conservationists

13:03.913 --> 13:06.350
and authenticators,
which means

13:06.394 --> 13:08.613
you cannot touch anything
until then.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.877
You're saying
a lot of words,

13:10.920 --> 13:13.270
and all I'm hearing is
"delay, delay, delay,"

13:13.314 --> 13:15.490
so let's move this thing along,
okay, honey?

13:15.533 --> 13:17.709
And now this is how
I spin it into gold:

13:17.753 --> 13:20.147
What if we set up
a huge media day

13:20.190 --> 13:21.539
and a public dedication?

13:21.583 --> 13:22.976
Everyone should know
what we found here.

13:23.019 --> 13:25.108
And then we can
get back to work.

13:26.370 --> 13:27.632
Agreed.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.330
I need to call my boss.

13:31.245 --> 13:33.508
You see? Good things
come to those

13:33.551 --> 13:36.554
who respect the past.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.732
Sorry I'm late.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.952
Traffic was horrible,
and for some reason,

13:42.996 --> 13:45.520
my driver kept getting lost,
but if we leave right now,

13:45.563 --> 13:47.827
we can get to
the board meeting on time.

13:47.870 --> 13:50.177
Oh, you must not
have got my texts.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.266
Uh, they moved
the meeting up.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.181
I actually just got back.

13:54.224 --> 13:55.573
What?

13:55.617 --> 13:56.966
Well, I figured you
weren't interested

13:57.010 --> 13:58.620
or had a hair appointment
or something.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.274
Which looks fabulous,
by the way.

14:00.317 --> 14:01.623
Did you get it colored?

14:01.666 --> 14:03.146
This is crazy.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.844
I was supposed to
be there for Blake.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.976
I know.
That's what I told the board.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.109
But, you know,
it all worked out in the end.

14:09.152 --> 14:11.589
They named me acting CEO
of the winery,

14:11.633 --> 14:14.114
which isn't being
sold to anyone.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.986
So, Father will be pleased
about that.

14:19.032 --> 14:21.425
You rescheduled
the board meeting, right?

14:21.469 --> 14:22.905
Don't be so paranoid.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.125
I'm not in charge of
scheduling board meetings.

14:25.168 --> 14:26.953
And look, let's be honest.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.693
There's really not much
you could have done there,

14:28.737 --> 14:30.173
you know, considering
you're not a Carrington.

14:38.486 --> 14:39.791
Hey, Doctor.

14:42.229 --> 14:43.839
I'm sorry, I don't remember,
are you, uh...

14:43.883 --> 14:48.409
Are you from, uh,
psych or neurology?

14:48.452 --> 14:51.542
Yes.

14:53.327 --> 14:56.069
Do you remember me from before?

14:57.113 --> 14:58.636
Uh, no, I don't.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.292
My memory's, uh...

15:02.336 --> 15:03.946
Well, you tell me.

15:03.990 --> 15:07.645
Because this gap
in my life is...

15:07.689 --> 15:08.908
insanely frustrating.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.648
Right. Sure.

15:10.692 --> 15:13.956
So... I know we've
already been through this,

15:14.000 --> 15:15.740
but one more time.

15:15.784 --> 15:18.134
What do you remember about
the day of the accident?

15:18.178 --> 15:19.353
Every detail.

15:19.396 --> 15:22.095
Uh, easy. Nothing.

15:22.138 --> 15:24.358
That's great.
I mean, that's great

15:24.401 --> 15:25.881
that you don't remember
the pain.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.709
So, what's the last thing
you do remember?

15:27.752 --> 15:29.102
How far back?

15:29.145 --> 15:31.060
Shouldn't you
already know this?

15:31.104 --> 15:33.976
Yes, but this is how we
continually test your memory.

15:34.020 --> 15:37.893
Well, uh, from
what Dave told me,

15:37.937 --> 15:41.114
the last thing
I remember is from...

15:41.157 --> 15:42.854
around two years ago.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.204
That's right.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.509
Well done.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.468
Is this normal
amnesia protocol?

15:47.511 --> 15:49.557
It's more post-protocol banter.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.689
Good morning, Doctor.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.083
Oh, it's you.

15:54.127 --> 15:56.042
Lovely to see you again.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.478
Mrs. Van Kirk.

15:57.521 --> 15:59.306
You know my doctor?

15:59.349 --> 16:01.308
Yes, I do.

16:01.351 --> 16:03.005
Very well.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.920
Actually, could I see you
outside for a sec?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.139
Uh, I'm an adult.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.837
I'd rather you talk
about me in front of me.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.273
Don't be silly.

16:10.317 --> 16:11.927
I don't keep secrets
from my boy.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.625
I promise I'll fill you in
on everything.

16:14.669 --> 16:17.237
Well, maybe not
everything.

16:25.506 --> 16:28.726
I heard something about you,
Blake Carrington.

16:28.770 --> 16:32.469
Well... that doesn't mean
it's true.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.297
Yeah, well, I heard
is that you're the man

16:34.341 --> 16:36.778
responsible for the porterhouse
steaks we had for dinner.

16:38.432 --> 16:41.000
Best steak I ever had
in my life.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.482
Well, no problem, gentlemen.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.223
Just made a phone call
to a friend.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.399
Seemed like the right
thing to do.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.314
We're all in here together.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.534
No reason to live like animals.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.318
Very kind of you, sir.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.106
You have a nice evening.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.466
Rick?

17:12.509 --> 17:13.989
Hi.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.599
Hi.

17:15.643 --> 17:18.211
You're even better looking
than your profile pic.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.647
Thank you.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.214
I could say the same
about you.

17:21.257 --> 17:25.566
Which is unheard of
on a dating app these days.

17:25.609 --> 17:28.786
So I guess this is where
you offer to buy me a drink.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.614
I'll have an old-fashioned.

17:30.658 --> 17:32.094
My tab.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.096
Let me ask you a question, Rick.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.837
Hmm?

17:35.880 --> 17:38.666
You ever find yourself
in the mood

17:38.709 --> 17:40.624
you don't want to be alone?

17:40.668 --> 17:43.323
You're looking for someone
special to keep you company?

17:43.366 --> 17:46.065
I'm in one of those moods
right now.

17:46.108 --> 17:50.417
Look at us.
Two special souls.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.680
I wonder what else
we have in common.

17:54.899 --> 17:58.468
Did someone order the pan-seared
Chilean sea bass?

17:58.512 --> 18:00.383
Fallon? Whoa, what?

18:00.427 --> 18:01.863
I mean, I didn't.

18:01.906 --> 18:03.212
Well, that's the charm
of my service.

18:03.256 --> 18:05.127
I deliver it before
you even know you want it.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.650
You really shouldn't
have done all this.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.566
Full confession, I've basically
taken a micro-course

18:09.610 --> 18:12.091
in retrograde amnesia
over the past few days,

18:12.134 --> 18:14.267
and stimulating sense memory is
supposed to be the best cure.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.964
Does this mean I don't
get to eat it?

18:16.007 --> 18:18.575
No, no, no, not yet.
Just smell.

18:18.619 --> 18:22.144
Chilean sea bass is the
first meal you cooked for me.

18:22.188 --> 18:25.278
You know? That's right.
Yeah. Breathe it in.

18:25.321 --> 18:26.670
Mm.

18:26.714 --> 18:28.498
That smells amazing.
Yeah.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.326
It was very sweet.
You came over to the manor

18:30.370 --> 18:31.458
and cooked it for me.

18:31.501 --> 18:32.894
It was very romantic.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.375
Sorry, I'm not really
remembering anything.

18:35.418 --> 18:36.550
Other than being hungry.

18:36.593 --> 18:37.855
So can I eat this now?

18:37.899 --> 18:39.379
No, no, no, no, no.
Uh, not yet.

18:39.422 --> 18:41.729
First, phase two.Whoa.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.426
Is this like some sort
of Dracula fetish?

18:43.470 --> 18:45.907
No, it's-it's rose water.
It's your favorite.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.648
Come on, just sniff.
Sniff my neck.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.563
Seriously?Yes. It's science.

18:49.606 --> 18:52.435
Hey, okay.

18:52.479 --> 18:55.134
No, I'm still
picking up sea bass.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.617
Now?

19:04.926 --> 19:06.884
Yeah.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.538
It's actually quite nice.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.279
So it's working?

19:10.323 --> 19:12.194
Something's working.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.631
LAURA:
Oh, what on earth?

19:14.675 --> 19:16.938
It smells like
a fish brothel in here.

19:16.981 --> 19:19.201
Okay, you just insulted
everyone in here,

19:19.245 --> 19:20.507
including the bass.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.291
Take your bass and leave.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.641
Ooh, I could do that,
or I could stay.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.600
I'm torn, Laura,
but I think I'm gonna stay.

19:26.643 --> 19:28.297
I see.

19:28.341 --> 19:31.170
I need security
in here immediately!

19:31.213 --> 19:32.388
Security!

19:32.432 --> 19:33.824
Okay, don't pay attention
to that, okay?

19:33.868 --> 19:35.652
We were engaged, okay?
I mean...

19:35.696 --> 19:37.176
remember,
I proposed to you?

19:37.219 --> 19:39.221
In a rowboat on Lake Carrington.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.614
I even used your father's ring.

19:40.657 --> 19:45.009
LAURA:
Oh, you mean this ring...

19:45.053 --> 19:47.055
that I have worn
around my neck every day

19:47.098 --> 19:50.014
since Liam's
father died?

19:50.058 --> 19:54.149
You just have to
make things up, don't you?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.151
Liam, Liam, please, okay?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.588
We were, we were married,
and then divorced.

19:58.632 --> 20:00.634
And then engaged,
with that ring, okay.

20:00.677 --> 20:02.244
I know it sounds ridiculous,

20:02.288 --> 20:03.811
but how could I make
something like that up?

20:03.854 --> 20:04.942
I am not that creative.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.466
Please,
you have to trust me.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.163
I-I don't know
what to say.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.121
Finally.
Would you please escort

20:10.165 --> 20:12.298
this madwoman out?No, no, no.

20:12.341 --> 20:13.603
You don't have to do that,

20:13.647 --> 20:16.476
because today, everybody
makes their own choices.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.304
This is family-only
visiting hours,

20:18.347 --> 20:19.870
and she is definitely
not family.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.655
No, don't come near me.
No, get away.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.265
Get away from me.
Away, away.

20:23.309 --> 20:24.788
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.
Ah! Oh!

20:24.832 --> 20:25.963
Inhale, Liam, okay?

20:26.007 --> 20:27.400
Let the rose water
bring you back.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.315
Do something, do something.
I want her out!

20:29.358 --> 20:30.316
Come on, ma'am.

20:30.359 --> 20:31.578
LAURA:
Out!

20:38.019 --> 20:39.194
Get out!

20:39.238 --> 20:40.717
Okay, okay.

20:40.761 --> 20:41.979
Here, just eat the fish, okay?

20:42.023 --> 20:43.285
Eat the bass.
It'll bring you back, okay?

20:43.329 --> 20:44.460
The fish will work.Let's go. Come on.

20:44.504 --> 20:45.983
Good night, dear.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.289
FALLON:
Laura!

20:47.333 --> 20:49.683
Kiss my bass.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.259
Kirby?

21:00.302 --> 21:02.261
Funny seeing you here.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.045
Funny?

21:04.088 --> 21:06.656
I think maybe something
got lost in translation.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.529
Hey, are you good?

21:09.572 --> 21:11.400
No. I'm angry.

21:11.444 --> 21:14.316
Because of Kirby?
You got nothing to worry about.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.448
Not Kirby.

21:15.491 --> 21:17.493
I'm angry
about this.

21:17.537 --> 21:20.670
You and I have sacrificed
so much. And for what?

21:20.714 --> 21:22.846
For your son to come in
behind my back and take charge?

21:22.890 --> 21:24.326
Adam?

21:24.370 --> 21:26.110
After everything
we discussed,

21:26.154 --> 21:28.765
he shut me out of the
board meeting for the winery.

21:28.809 --> 21:31.333
He's the new CEO.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.813
Really?

21:32.856 --> 21:34.554
Are you kidding me right now?

21:34.597 --> 21:35.946
You're happy
about this?

21:35.990 --> 21:37.383
No, no. I'm not happy

21:37.426 --> 21:39.428
that he excluded you.

21:39.472 --> 21:40.951
But I am proud
that he's finally showing

21:40.995 --> 21:42.431
a little Carrington blood.

21:42.475 --> 21:45.434
I was beginning to think
he was a little too soft.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.131
You don't get it.No.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.437
I don't care.

21:48.481 --> 21:50.526
Because at the end of the day,
I'm in charge.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.615
I need to get out of here,
so when is that gonna happen?

21:52.659 --> 21:54.748
I talked to a few people
about the bail hearing.

21:54.791 --> 21:55.966
And it looks good,

21:56.010 --> 21:58.360
but you may end up
owing a lot of favors.

21:58.404 --> 22:01.929
Just hold on for
one more night.

22:01.972 --> 22:03.322
Can you?

22:03.365 --> 22:05.280
Hey.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.108
Don't worry. I'm fine.

22:07.151 --> 22:10.329
The people in here like me.
What can I say?

22:10.372 --> 22:13.244
I'm always the most popular man
wherever I end up, huh?

22:13.288 --> 22:15.595
It's a curse, really.

22:15.638 --> 22:17.161
Look, I'm sorry
for shutting you down

22:17.205 --> 22:18.380
when you tried to
help bail me out.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.123
Hello?

22:22.166 --> 22:25.692
Are you even listening to me or
would you rather go visit Blake?

22:25.735 --> 22:29.609
I'm sorry. I just, um,
I hate what they did to you.

22:29.652 --> 22:32.612
And, uh, I haven't
really been sleeping well, so...

22:32.655 --> 22:34.962
Yeah, me, neither.

22:35.005 --> 22:37.443
Never thought I'd miss
my pillow this much.

22:37.486 --> 22:40.663
Well... if, uh,

22:40.707 --> 22:43.405
if you wanted,
I could go and check on it,

22:43.449 --> 22:45.407
make sure it's okay.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.757
They kicked me out of the manor.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.455
So, you don't have
a place to live?

22:49.498 --> 22:52.893
Mm-hmm. That's, um,
partly why I'm here.

22:52.936 --> 22:55.156
Kirby, you can crash
at my place.

22:55.199 --> 22:56.810
Really?
Yeah.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.725
I'm not using it.

22:58.768 --> 23:01.118
Oh, my God, thank you.
I'll take care of everything.

23:01.162 --> 23:02.511
I mean, I'll water your plants.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.426
Do you even have plants?
'Cause if you don't,

23:04.470 --> 23:06.123
I'll get plants,
and then I'll water them.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.910
I swear, the universe is playing

23:09.953 --> 23:12.434
some sick, karmic joke on me
as punishment.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.305
I mean,
the Trixie stuff was bad,

23:14.349 --> 23:16.873
and then I had to deal
with Ashley, but saddling me

23:16.917 --> 23:18.048
with Laura Van Kirk?

23:18.092 --> 23:19.615
I mean, really?
It's just too much.

23:19.659 --> 23:22.618
And I know that Adam gave her
that ring back, and I know

23:22.662 --> 23:24.446
I can't get her
to admit it

23:24.490 --> 23:26.317
and I know I won't
be able to prove it.

23:26.361 --> 23:30.104
Have you thought about
maybe just giving up,

23:30.147 --> 23:34.630
and trying things fresh in,
like, three to five years?

23:34.674 --> 23:36.371
Aren't you being sentenced soon?

23:36.415 --> 23:37.503
I-I'm just trying
to remind you

23:37.546 --> 23:39.113
of the time factor.

23:39.156 --> 23:41.898
Yes, I am well aware of the
time factor. It's just that...

23:41.942 --> 23:44.074
I keep looking into Liam's eyes

23:44.118 --> 23:47.338
and searching for some glimmer
of us, and there is nothing.

23:47.382 --> 23:49.340
And I-I don't know what to do.

23:49.384 --> 23:51.255
Well, maybe you have to think
outside the box.

23:51.299 --> 23:54.955
This is not your everyday
"amnesia boy meets rich girl

23:54.998 --> 23:56.522
for the second time" story,

23:56.565 --> 23:58.567
this is Fallon and Liam
we're talking about.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.874
Your relationship
has always been epic.

24:00.917 --> 24:03.224
Epic is a strong word.

24:03.267 --> 24:04.834
Fine, let's call it crazy, then.

24:04.878 --> 24:07.924
I mean, you-you married the guy
when he was a total stranger

24:07.968 --> 24:10.318
to avoid marrying your cousin.

24:10.361 --> 24:13.147
To be fair, I did not know that
Jeff was my cousin at the time.

24:13.190 --> 24:15.628
Look, all I'm saying is, if you
want to make Liam remember you,

24:15.671 --> 24:18.326
you're gonna have to
be as unconventional

24:18.369 --> 24:19.675
as your
relationship was.

24:19.719 --> 24:20.981
Sorry, "is."

24:21.024 --> 24:23.244
You are totally right.

24:23.287 --> 24:26.813
I'm a Carrington. Of course
I'm gonna do something epic.

24:49.096 --> 24:50.227
Hey.

24:50.271 --> 24:51.402
Hey...

24:51.446 --> 24:52.360
Is there a problem?

24:52.403 --> 24:53.796
Oh, there's a big problem.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.059
You think one steak is gonna
make you part of a crew?

24:56.103 --> 24:57.800
You think that gets
you set in here?

24:57.844 --> 24:59.802
All right,
let me make some calls.

24:59.846 --> 25:02.501
You got any allergies
to shellfish?

25:02.544 --> 25:06.853
Culhane was right about you,
and everybody in here knows it.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.992
Is your life
so pathetic

25:16.036 --> 25:17.298
that you have to work this hard

25:17.341 --> 25:19.735
to manipulate everyone in here
to hating me?

25:19.779 --> 25:21.258
I didn't have to try
very hard at all.

25:21.302 --> 25:24.174
Just had to tell them
who you really are.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.960
That you see me, them
and every other human being

25:27.003 --> 25:29.963
as pawns you can buy or sell.

25:30.006 --> 25:31.617
See, now, that's spoken
like a true pawn

25:31.660 --> 25:33.575
who wishes he had
the power of a king.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.099
Mm, I don't want to be a king

25:36.143 --> 25:38.319
if it makes me
anything like you.

25:38.362 --> 25:40.190
I'd rather be a man.

25:42.018 --> 25:45.326
You'll never be
a man, Culhane.

25:45.369 --> 25:47.023
Because no matter how many
times I ruin your life,

25:47.067 --> 25:49.678
you just keep
crawling back for more.

25:49.722 --> 25:51.462
Now, you would've thought
that my poisoning your father

25:51.506 --> 25:53.508
would've done the trick, but no.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.118
Nah, I guess not, huh?

25:59.209 --> 26:01.864
Get...

26:20.448 --> 26:22.581
Hey.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.105
Touch me again
and I'll destroy you.

26:25.148 --> 26:26.976
What are you gonna do?

26:27.020 --> 26:29.500
Bring Anders in here
to beat me up?

26:29.544 --> 26:32.503
We both know you don't have the
guts to do anything yourself.

26:32.547 --> 26:35.158
You just keep pushing me,
Culhane. You'll find out.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.160
Please.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.728
You talk tough like a man,
but we both know

26:39.772 --> 26:41.425
you're just a little boy

26:41.469 --> 26:43.863
who inherited
everything he ever got.

26:43.906 --> 26:46.692
A little boy afraid
to get his hands dirty.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.652
Oh, no, they're plenty dirty.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.828
I'd tell you to ask Mack,
but see, these hands,

26:52.872 --> 26:54.961
they took care of that problem.

26:55.004 --> 26:57.398
So unless you want to end up
at the bottom of the lake,

26:57.441 --> 26:59.922
your better
shut your mouth.

27:08.844 --> 27:10.367
I want it to look authentic,

27:10.411 --> 27:12.979
but make sure my shoulders
are rippling under the jacket.

27:13.022 --> 27:16.635
People in the future
should know I worked out, a lot.

27:16.678 --> 27:17.940
Before you say
anything judgmental,

27:17.984 --> 27:20.682
or even think
anything judgmental...

27:20.726 --> 27:22.597
Thoughts are
already forming.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.382
If I'm going to capitalize
on the history of this place,

27:25.426 --> 27:27.689
I got to, well,
party like McCarty.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.299
I admire your enthusiasm.

27:29.343 --> 27:30.779
Uhp, just wait.

27:30.823 --> 27:33.956
For media day, I'm planning
to unveil this portrait of me

27:34.000 --> 27:36.393
right next
to that portrait of Bernard

27:36.437 --> 27:39.222
in our newly named
McCarty's Lounge.

27:39.266 --> 27:42.617
Is there anything else I ought
to know as your number two?

27:42.661 --> 27:44.924
Uh, yes. I'm also having
the McCarty insignia

27:44.967 --> 27:46.273
printed everywhere.

27:46.316 --> 27:49.102
Napkins, umbrellas, toast.

27:49.145 --> 27:51.670
Your ingenuity is admirable.

27:51.713 --> 27:54.281
But? There's always
a but with you.

27:54.324 --> 27:58.894
Well, there is this curious RSVP
we received to your media day

27:58.938 --> 28:01.897
from a member of
the McCarty family.

28:01.941 --> 28:04.204
Uh... bah-bah,
blah, blah, blah...

28:04.247 --> 28:07.120
"...surprised
to get your invite.

28:07.163 --> 28:10.471
"I am shocked you are
celebrating my horr--

28:10.514 --> 28:13.126
"my horrible great-grandfather,

28:13.169 --> 28:17.347
and wouldn't be
caught dead there. Pass."

28:20.002 --> 28:23.789
So... she sounds nice.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.747
Nothing about this feels right.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.749
I know. Just give me one hour

28:27.793 --> 28:29.838
to prove to you
that I'm not an insane person.

28:29.882 --> 28:31.840
Well, you're kidnapping me
from a hospital, so...

28:31.884 --> 28:34.451
The hour doesn't start
until we cross the street.

28:37.324 --> 28:40.283
Even when we get bail,
this case isn't going away.

28:40.327 --> 28:43.722
They may ask you
to testify against Blake.

28:43.765 --> 28:46.202
BAILIFF:
All rise.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.989
Okay, let's move this along.

28:50.032 --> 28:51.860
Mr. Carrington.

28:51.904 --> 28:53.949
On the charge of murder,
how do you plead?

28:53.993 --> 28:57.692
Oh, uh, not guilty, Your Honor.

28:59.041 --> 29:00.521
Very well.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.436
Due to additional evidence
that has come

29:02.479 --> 29:06.483
to the court's attention,
your request for bail is denied.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.617
I'm remanding you
back into custody.

29:09.660 --> 29:12.315
Evidentiary hearing dates
will be set next week.

29:12.359 --> 29:13.969
We're adjourned.

29:14.013 --> 29:15.754
What the hell?

29:15.797 --> 29:16.798
That's impossible.

29:16.842 --> 29:19.105
You can't let them
take him back there!

29:20.367 --> 29:21.455
Mitchell,
do something.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.587
It's okay.

29:29.028 --> 29:33.075
So glad I could
be here for this.

29:34.598 --> 29:37.993
Did I forget to mention that
Joey is an undercover agent?

29:38.037 --> 29:40.169
You see, I made
a little deal with the Feds.

29:40.213 --> 29:43.129
"Get Blake to admit his guilt,
we'll let you walk."

29:43.172 --> 29:45.784
You talked, so I'm walking.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.134
You just made a huge mistake.

29:48.177 --> 29:50.266
Yeah. We'll see about that.

29:57.883 --> 30:02.452
Okay. You were standing
right there,

30:02.496 --> 30:05.455
carrying a motorcycle helmet.

30:05.499 --> 30:07.457
I rode a motorcycle?

30:08.894 --> 30:12.375
Yeah. I kind of remember that.

30:12.419 --> 30:14.725
And? That's it?

30:14.769 --> 30:17.728
I mean, you totally
started to flirt with me.

30:17.772 --> 30:19.643
One thing led to another,
and then before you know it,

30:19.687 --> 30:21.341
we were in there
in that courthouse,

30:21.384 --> 30:23.082
about to sign on
the dotted line.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.866
Oh, and one more thing.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.782
I am wearing
the exact same dress,

30:27.826 --> 30:31.133
which is a huge fashion risk,
since it's two seasons old.

30:31.177 --> 30:33.135
I like it.

30:33.179 --> 30:34.920
Well, of course you do.

30:34.963 --> 30:37.574
Because we belong
together, Liam.

30:37.618 --> 30:40.882
And we have ever since we met,
at this spot.

30:42.405 --> 30:44.016
I wish you knew how much
this was killing me right now,

30:44.059 --> 30:48.237
because I really, really,
really miss you.

31:07.953 --> 31:10.694
Were you wearing
a different color hat?

31:10.738 --> 31:13.480
Yes. Yes, I was.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.134
It was white.

31:15.177 --> 31:17.005
Do you remember that?

31:17.049 --> 31:19.790
LAURA:
Unbelievable.

31:19.834 --> 31:23.098
Kidnapping? Truly?

31:23.142 --> 31:25.927
Is there any line
that you won't cross?

31:25.971 --> 31:27.929
Do you have a tracker on me?

31:27.973 --> 31:29.148
Don't be ridiculous.

31:29.191 --> 31:30.845
I have a tracker on him.

31:39.114 --> 31:41.290
What on earth compelled you
to take Liam out of that safe

31:41.334 --> 31:44.467
and-and clean hospital room
into this filthy street?

31:44.511 --> 31:45.860
Honestly, Fallon,

31:45.904 --> 31:47.557
from this stunt
to that hat,

31:47.601 --> 31:49.385
you're a poor
decision maker.

31:49.429 --> 31:50.865
Liam never shared
with you the details

31:50.909 --> 31:52.519
of the night we met?

31:52.562 --> 31:54.869
That's funny, I thought
you two were close.

31:54.913 --> 31:58.786
Well, I guess he didn't think
it was a significant event.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.179
We're leaving.No, no, no, no.

32:00.222 --> 32:02.181
Not so fast.

32:02.224 --> 32:04.966
You!

32:05.010 --> 32:06.228
FALLON:
I got it.

32:06.272 --> 32:07.447
No, no.Yes, I got it.

32:08.883 --> 32:09.884
No!No!

32:09.928 --> 32:11.407
No. Oh!No.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.976
LAURA: Stop it.Give it to me.
Leave him alone!

32:15.020 --> 32:16.586
Stop it.No. You stop it.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.240
You let go!
You let go!

32:18.284 --> 32:19.981
Stop it! Stop it!Leave him alone.

32:21.548 --> 32:22.897
Stop!
Oh...

32:25.030 --> 32:26.205
Both of you!

32:26.248 --> 32:28.511
Liam, will you please
tell your mother

32:28.555 --> 32:31.079
that you remember something
about the night we met.

32:31.123 --> 32:33.995
Maybe I did.
I don't know.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.476
I believe what
you're saying, I do.

32:36.519 --> 32:38.347
But sitting here watching you
fight with my mother

32:38.391 --> 32:40.436
isn't gonna bring my
memory back any faster.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.961
Don't beat yourself up
too badly, Fallon.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.963
Just enough!

32:45.006 --> 32:46.790
I can tell
it's important to you

32:46.834 --> 32:49.141
that I remember
our relationship.

32:49.184 --> 32:51.708
I'm afraid my memory
might never come back.

32:51.752 --> 32:52.971
And the pressure
you're putting on me

32:53.014 --> 32:55.016
is kind of freaking me out.

32:55.060 --> 32:57.888
So can you please just stop?

33:00.152 --> 33:02.632
SAM:
So, the media day I have planned

33:02.676 --> 33:04.460
is to celebrate my connection

33:04.504 --> 33:06.288
to your great-grandfather's
legacy.

33:06.332 --> 33:09.204
And I was hoping that
you could set aside

33:09.248 --> 33:11.032
your personal
differences with him

33:11.076 --> 33:13.817
and be a part
of the festivities.

33:13.861 --> 33:17.647
Did he kick you out of
the will or something?

33:17.691 --> 33:19.301
This is not about money.

33:19.345 --> 33:21.825
I can't believe you,
of all people,

33:21.869 --> 33:23.131
are honoring him.
I mean...

33:23.175 --> 33:25.351
I follow you on Instagram,
and I assumed

33:25.394 --> 33:27.048
you'd be all about gay rights.

33:27.092 --> 33:28.484
What are you talking about?

33:28.528 --> 33:31.574
I am all about gay rights.
Every day is Pride for me.

33:31.618 --> 33:34.969
My great-grandfather Bernard
was an advocate

33:35.013 --> 33:36.449
for gay conversion therapy.

33:36.492 --> 33:39.104
He refused to serve
or hire gay people

33:39.147 --> 33:40.540
at any of his hotels.

33:40.583 --> 33:43.630
An "abomination," he called us.

33:45.501 --> 33:48.809
Uh... I'm so sorry.

33:48.852 --> 33:53.205
I... I obviously had no
idea about any of this.

33:53.248 --> 33:56.556
Yeah, well, it's not
on his Wikipedia page.

33:56.599 --> 33:59.776
So you're telling me that
the whole city is invited

33:59.820 --> 34:03.911
to my hotel to commemorate
a famous homophobe?

34:03.954 --> 34:06.348
Pretty much.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.223
Well, that's not
great.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.442
FALLON:
I have made many

34:13.486 --> 34:15.923
bad choices in my life,
Your Honor.

34:15.966 --> 34:19.883
I really can't say which
consequences are fair or just,

34:19.927 --> 34:22.103
but I am ready to atone.

34:22.147 --> 34:25.802
Ms. Carrington, you are a woman
of exceptional means

34:25.846 --> 34:28.240
and what many people believe
is extreme influence

34:28.283 --> 34:30.155
in certain parts
of this county.

34:30.198 --> 34:32.374
But rather than lock
those assets up,

34:32.418 --> 34:34.855
I'm gonna make an example of you
and put them to use.

34:34.898 --> 34:38.554
I'm sentencing you to 100
hours of community service.

34:38.598 --> 34:39.729
I strongly suggest

34:39.773 --> 34:42.036
you use your means and influence

34:42.080 --> 34:44.995
for the good of this community
and not for yourself.

34:45.039 --> 34:46.562
You're dismissed.

34:47.607 --> 34:49.087
Thank you, Your Honor.

34:49.130 --> 34:52.438
Wow. That's unbelievable.

34:52.481 --> 34:54.135
You got off easy,
to say the least.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.311
Easy?

34:56.355 --> 34:59.967
I am off to the hospital
to visit my fiancé,

35:00.010 --> 35:02.622
who almost died,
has no memory of me,

35:02.665 --> 35:05.059
and now thinks he's in love
with another woman.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.409
Nothing is easy for me
right now.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.466
Carrington, come with me.

35:30.867 --> 35:35.002
Blake Carrington,
will you marry me?

35:43.141 --> 35:46.622
♪ I get to love you

35:46.666 --> 35:51.018
♪ It's the best thing
that I'll ever do ♪

35:51.061 --> 35:53.629
I do.♪ I get to love you

35:53.673 --> 35:55.892
I do.

35:55.936 --> 35:59.983
♪ It's a promise
I'm making to you ♪

36:00.027 --> 36:04.727
♪ Whatever may come,
your heart I will choose ♪

36:04.771 --> 36:08.992
♪ Forever I'm yours,
forever I do. ♪

36:09.036 --> 36:11.778
Okay, now, wrap it up so I can
return you to your cell

36:11.821 --> 36:13.954
and get to the women's jail.

36:13.997 --> 36:15.260
Back-to-back ceremonies.

36:15.303 --> 36:17.218
And lose the boutonniere.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.089
I mean, unless you want someone
to stab you with it

36:19.133 --> 36:21.222
in your sleep.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.484
And the ring.

36:24.443 --> 36:26.575
BLAKE:
I got to get out of here.

36:26.619 --> 36:29.187
Have Mitchell appeal
that joke of a bail hearing

36:29.230 --> 36:30.449
and figure something out.

36:30.492 --> 36:32.277
I will.

36:33.321 --> 36:36.455
I will do whatever it takes
to get you out.

36:36.498 --> 36:40.807
You killed Mack for me.
I'll never forget that.

36:40.850 --> 36:42.548
I understand
this sounds extreme,

36:42.591 --> 36:44.811
but in light of learning
that Bernard McCarty was

36:44.854 --> 36:47.161
a major homophobe,
our only option is

36:47.205 --> 36:48.380
to cancel media day.

36:48.423 --> 36:50.556
Some things are better
left in the past.

36:50.599 --> 36:52.993
Well, I-I am sympathetic
to your plight,

36:53.036 --> 36:54.995
but the president
of the Historical Alliance

36:55.038 --> 36:57.302
has made this her
grand event of the year,

36:57.345 --> 37:00.870
and you do not want
to mess with the president.

37:00.914 --> 37:03.351
I don't think you understand
how deeply I oppose

37:03.395 --> 37:04.570
honoring this man.

37:04.613 --> 37:06.267
And if the president
has a heart,

37:06.311 --> 37:08.051
I'm sure I can persuade her
to cancel.

37:08.095 --> 37:10.576
She doesn't, and you won't.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.055
Sorry.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.233
Cristal.

37:15.276 --> 37:16.538
I came right away.

37:16.582 --> 37:19.019
Why? I didn't ask you to.

37:19.062 --> 37:20.803
There's a leaked
photo of Blake.

37:20.847 --> 37:23.241
It's everywhere.What? Where is it?

37:23.284 --> 37:25.765
I just so happen to have it.

37:27.506 --> 37:29.247
Oh, this is bad.

37:29.290 --> 37:30.291
Yes, dear, I know.

37:30.335 --> 37:32.946
It's a PR nightmare.
Can you imagine

37:32.989 --> 37:35.078
all of the potential
jurors seeing this?

37:35.122 --> 37:36.993
It's going to take forever
to find a jury

37:37.037 --> 37:38.125
who's not biased.

37:38.168 --> 37:39.866
The great news is

37:39.909 --> 37:41.998
I will happily
take the reins

37:42.042 --> 37:45.915
and handle the media,
as a Carrington.

37:45.959 --> 37:48.962
That is so thoughtful
of you, Dominique,

37:49.005 --> 37:52.139
but since Blake and I
just got married,

37:52.182 --> 37:54.533
that makes me
a Carrington, too.

37:54.576 --> 37:57.275
And a much more
powerful one than you.

37:57.318 --> 38:00.147
So, thank you
for your offer,

38:00.190 --> 38:02.323
but I've got it from here.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.068
Oh, my God, hi!

38:08.111 --> 38:10.157
Welcome home.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.594
I'm not sure whose home.

38:12.638 --> 38:15.641
Oh, oh, everything
can be rearranged.

38:15.684 --> 38:17.295
I promise.
It's just I needed,

38:17.338 --> 38:18.992
um, more room for my stuff,

38:19.035 --> 38:21.168
so I had to rearrange
some things.

38:21.211 --> 38:22.604
And redecorate.

38:22.648 --> 38:25.215
Yeah, I-I got you a cactus,

38:25.259 --> 38:28.436
'cause I-I didn't know how long
you'd be staying in jail for.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.656
Oh, and-and this.

38:30.699 --> 38:32.875
MICHAEL:
That chessboard,

38:32.919 --> 38:35.530
isn't it from Blake's study?Mm-hmm.

38:35.574 --> 38:37.445
I stole it.

38:37.489 --> 38:40.100
Like an-an eye-for-an-eye thing.

38:40.143 --> 38:41.362
For you.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.712
I'm not sure that
taking his chessboard

38:43.756 --> 38:45.932
is the same as him
getting me arrested,

38:45.975 --> 38:49.457
but I appreciate the effort.

38:53.026 --> 38:54.810
Should we play?

38:54.854 --> 38:56.899
Don't really know how.

38:56.943 --> 38:59.685
Me neither.

39:07.823 --> 39:09.608
Kirby, listen...

39:09.651 --> 39:11.000
Don't say it.

39:11.044 --> 39:13.176
I'm really sorry.

39:17.616 --> 39:19.226
Making yourself right at home.

39:19.269 --> 39:22.403
Well, in my father's absence,
which I do hope will be brief,

39:22.447 --> 39:24.187
I feel quite confident
and comfortable

39:24.231 --> 39:25.667
steering the ship.

39:25.711 --> 39:29.105
That's so interesting,
because I feel quite confident

39:29.149 --> 39:32.674
that my husband wants
his brand-new wife

39:32.718 --> 39:34.415
to steer the ship.

39:34.459 --> 39:37.810
Well, I guess congratulations
are in order.

39:37.853 --> 39:41.074
Still, he hasn't told me,
his son,

39:41.117 --> 39:43.076
what his wishes are,

39:43.119 --> 39:47.428
so until then, I guess
we should keep things

39:47.472 --> 39:48.734
the way they are?

39:50.475 --> 39:51.606
For now.

39:53.173 --> 39:54.957
Oh, and, um,

39:55.001 --> 39:56.655
if it makes you feel
uncomfortable,

39:56.698 --> 39:59.048
you don't have to
call me "Mommy."

40:04.010 --> 40:06.142
Ah, Fallon,
I've been expecting you.

40:06.186 --> 40:07.448
I have a gift.

40:07.492 --> 40:10.625
Ah, let me guess.
A restraining order?

40:10.669 --> 40:12.061
Did you peek?

40:12.105 --> 40:13.323
Seriously?

40:13.367 --> 40:16.239
Your outbursts against me
have become violent.

40:16.283 --> 40:18.024
And I don't feel safe.

40:18.067 --> 40:20.026
And apparently,
the court agrees.

40:20.069 --> 40:22.245
Does the court know
you are insane?

40:22.289 --> 40:24.596
And you are
legally prohibited

40:24.639 --> 40:26.815
from coming within
50 feet of me,

40:26.859 --> 40:29.470
or Liam,
whenever I'm with him,

40:29.514 --> 40:31.472
which will be constantly.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.866
No, no, no, no, no.
You can't do this.

40:33.909 --> 40:37.652
This gentleman has
a digital measuring device

40:37.696 --> 40:40.002
that determines
exactly 50 feet.

40:40.046 --> 40:41.656
So, whenever
he activates it,

40:41.700 --> 40:43.615
if you're within
that range,

40:43.658 --> 40:46.139
it will beep.

40:46.182 --> 40:47.227
Like that.

40:47.270 --> 40:49.359
Wait, it beeps just for me,

40:49.403 --> 40:51.405
or if anyone is within 50 feet?

40:51.449 --> 40:53.102
Well, it's-it's
not foolproof.

40:53.146 --> 40:56.279
The point is, when he sees you,
he'll activate it.

40:56.323 --> 40:58.325
And if it beeps,
then I have no choice

40:58.368 --> 41:00.458
but to report that
to Judge Anson.

41:00.501 --> 41:02.982
And that will surely lead
to your community service

41:03.025 --> 41:05.332
being revoked,
and then jail time.

41:05.375 --> 41:08.944
So, back it up, dear.

41:14.602 --> 41:15.864
More.

41:15.908 --> 41:18.127
Okay.

41:18.171 --> 41:19.955
Keep going.

41:19.999 --> 41:21.653
Further.

41:23.611 --> 41:25.134
All right, turn it off.

41:25.178 --> 41:27.223
It's giving me a headache.

41:27.267 --> 41:29.182
Get used to the distance, dear.

41:29.225 --> 41:32.098
You may have won
the battle, Laura,

41:32.141 --> 41:33.708
but I will win the war.

41:33.752 --> 41:36.885
No, dear,
you're losing everything.

41:36.929 --> 41:41.499
It may take Liam a while
to remember that he loves me,

41:41.542 --> 41:44.806
but it will only take him
a second to recall

41:44.850 --> 41:47.722
how fiercely he hates you.

41:47.766 --> 41:50.420
Which pales in comparison
to how much

41:50.464 --> 41:52.335
I hate you right now.

41:52.379 --> 41:54.468
Beep you, bitch.
