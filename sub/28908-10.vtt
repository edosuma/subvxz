00:12.262 --> 00:14.347
Listen, tomorrow is
the academic decathlon.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.641
You boys ready to battle, mano a mano?

00:16.725 --> 00:18.518
Eh, más o menos.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.563
I'm más, he's menos.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.775
But Gabe just bet 50 bucks on his kids

00:26.026 --> 00:27.610
without even asking for odds.

00:28.319 --> 00:31.656
Hey, man, American history
is full of underdog stories.

00:31.906 --> 00:35.618
That's right. They said that Davy Crockett
didn't stand a chance at the Alamo.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.203
He died at the Alamo.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.373
Oh, well...

00:40.874 --> 00:42.042
I teach English.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.127
[clicks tongue]

00:45.295 --> 00:48.131
Happy Decathlon Eve, everybody.

00:48.506 --> 00:52.135
Yup, tomorrow is Día de los Muertos
for Gabe's team.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.429
-[Abby] Oh!
-That means "Day of the Dead" in Spanish.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.932
Yeah, I know, Tony.
I'm not an idiot, I've seen Coco.

00:59.976 --> 01:02.353
And I've got a spirit animal
with all the answers,

01:02.437 --> 01:04.689
and her name is Marisol.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.275
But that's Maris-all you got.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.195
Hey, you see what I did there?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.906
Yeah, embarrass yourself? Yeah, I saw it.

01:14.657 --> 01:17.535
Gabe, you've taken your kids
on such a noble journey.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.746
You've already won a moral victory.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.247
Yeah, those aren't a lot of fun.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.458
[in high-pitched voice] "Hey, Skip,
we're here in downtown Long Beach

01:23.541 --> 01:26.002
for this year's Moral Victory Parade.

01:26.753 --> 01:30.340
As you can see, there's no one here
'cause those don't exist!"

01:32.675 --> 01:36.721
Gabe, my man Rakeem is so fired up
for the decathlon tomorrow.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.474
He'll dominate in long jump
and high hurdles.

01:41.434 --> 01:44.896
[in normal voice]
Uh, Coach? It's an academic decathlon.

01:45.563 --> 01:46.397
What?

01:48.817 --> 01:50.819
[chuckling]
I don't even know what that is.

01:50.902 --> 01:54.364
Our students answer questions
on a variety of school subjects.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.950
Oh, so sports for nerds.

02:00.411 --> 02:02.747
-I got great news, gang.
-So great.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.250
Turns out,
the principal of Lakewood suddenly left

02:05.333 --> 02:06.793
to spend more time with his family.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.378
You know what that means.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.088
He loves his family?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.382
Sure, we'll go with that.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.593
And I was just offered his job.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.096
But you turned it down, right?

02:19.139 --> 02:22.767
Gabe, remember when Mo'Nique won
the Academy Award for Precious?

02:23.309 --> 02:24.727
-Who?
-For what?

02:24.811 --> 02:26.020
Exactly.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.691
For some people,
opportunities are few and far between.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.860
But what about the opportunity
you have here?

02:31.943 --> 02:35.655
You know they'll build you a statue
if you green-light my flauta Fridays idea.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.576
Gabe, as a wife, a mother, and educator,

02:39.659 --> 02:42.620
I have spent my entire life looking out
for others.

02:42.954 --> 02:45.331
-Feels pretty good, doesn't it?
-Not particularly.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.793
It's time to look out for me,

02:49.085 --> 02:52.255
and what I want is to be
at an Elite 100 school.

02:52.547 --> 02:56.092
You can't! We need you. I need you.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.553
Your wisdom, your guidance...

02:58.636 --> 03:00.805
You taught me to use my bra as a purse.

03:00.889 --> 03:04.350
Aww! Mine's more of a weekender bag.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.771
We don't want you leaving for a weekend.
We don't want you leaving at all.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.523
Relax, people.

03:10.607 --> 03:14.027
The principal position here will be filled
by a qualified person.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.738
Some might even say more qualified.
[chuckles]

03:16.946 --> 03:18.573
No one will say that, Carlos.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.368
Sorry to disappoint everybody,

03:22.452 --> 03:23.828
but sometimes, this is what happens

03:23.912 --> 03:25.371
when you look out for yourself.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.292
But giving ourselves what we want
isn't always the right thing to do.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.376
If it was, I'd be

03:30.460 --> 03:32.003
in a Jack in the Box drive-through
right now.

about the history of our nation.

Yeah, and when Miss Mads subbed for you,

she taught us everything
about "Rhythm Nation."

I never made it

Hey, there's no "I" in team,
but there is an "M"... for Marisol.

much better than that,

Hello, subordinates.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.967
Why are you smiling like an idiot?

06:25.676 --> 06:27.678
Because with Paula decamping to Lakewood,

06:27.762 --> 06:30.264
I will be assuming full authority
over this school.

Well, I know why you're smiling.

why are you smiling like an idiot?

Turns out you were wrong about me.

Relax, Gabe.

I'm sure Carlos will lighten up
once he gets all the power.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.977
Or I might have that backward.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.813
Paula, you can't leave us.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.065
You're my own private Oprah.

If you call me Oprah again,

Ahh! Oh, you even sound just like her!

as white women love Oprah.

I already live with a strong
black woman that tells me what to read.

07:49.010 --> 07:49.886
Oh.

07:53.014 --> 07:53.931
[in normal voice] So, Gabe,

07:54.015 --> 07:56.017
do you think your kids
can keep it close tomorrow,

07:56.100 --> 07:57.727
or am I going to be MCing a blowout?

07:57.810 --> 08:02.356
Oh, is the Duchess of Lakewood
gonna be gracing us with her presence?

08:03.566 --> 08:06.611
Okay, silly, that job does not start
until after winter break.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.404
Oh, but speaking of big opportunities,

08:08.488 --> 08:12.200
I heard Marisol Fuentes 
is going on the Stanford trip.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.702
Yeah, I had to agree to go on a blind date

08:14.785 --> 08:17.038
with the Bingo caller
from her mom's church.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.501
Gabe, don't you think it's time
for Marisol to be in the honors class?

08:21.584 --> 08:24.545
A decathlon win would look great
on her transcript.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.088
She might get it with me.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.883
But even if she doesn't, Paula,
she's gonna be just fine.

08:29.008 --> 08:32.762
Oh. Is "just fine" what you want for her?

08:33.346 --> 08:34.847
If I'd settled for "just fine,"

08:34.931 --> 08:37.475
I'd still be traveling cross-country
with my first husband,

08:37.558 --> 08:39.894
selling T-shirts
after a Tracy Chapman concert.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.439
You know, ain't no shame in moving merch.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.282
Be honest, Gabe.

08:53.574 --> 08:56.953
Do you want Marisol on your team
because it's what's best for her,

08:57.036 --> 08:58.496
or because it's what's best for you?

08:59.288 --> 09:01.374
Paula, you can't do this to me.

09:01.457 --> 09:04.669
I worked my butt off all year.
Don't I deserve a win?

09:04.752 --> 09:05.586
Mmm.

09:05.670 --> 09:09.423
I just heard two "I"s,
a "me," and a "my" come out of you.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.218
That doesn't sound like Gabe,
that sounds like Kanye.

09:14.887 --> 09:15.721
You're right.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.682

-Hey, Marisol.
-Hey.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.817
You know what brilliant idea
just occurred to me?

09:28.859 --> 09:32.530
A decathlon victory would look really good
on your college applications.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.033
Well, it's not out of the question.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.369
All we need is Mikey
to overcome his nerves,

09:38.452 --> 09:39.787
Lorenzo not to get the yips,

09:39.870 --> 09:42.164
and Walt to put his vape pen down.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.544
Okay, it's a long shot.

09:47.837 --> 09:52.216
Yeah. But what if, and I mean, what if...

09:52.633 --> 09:55.553
you were on the honors team
instead of our team?

09:56.762 --> 10:01.267
What? I can't... leave our team.
I'm the glue that holds it together.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.269
Come on, let's be honest.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.688
You're the glue, the staples,

10:06.063 --> 10:07.773
the paper, the answers...

10:07.857 --> 10:08.733
Come on.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.739
-the planet, the stars...
-Okay.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.533
But, you wanna win as much as I do.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.661
I know. [chuckles]
And apparently, that's a bad thing.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.208
You belong in the honors class with peers
who will challenge you.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.128
You don't think being on a team
with Mikey is a challenge?

10:30.588 --> 10:33.799
He follows me around like a dog
whose owner just came back from war.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.261
Have you tried throwing a squeaky toy
down the hall?

10:38.638 --> 10:39.764
Why are you doing this?

10:39.847 --> 10:41.390
Because I want what's best for you.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.934
I know how hard you've worked 
for our team.

10:44.268 --> 10:45.770
Isn't this decathlon important to you?

10:46.312 --> 10:48.898
It is, but not as important
as you are to me.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.116
Good morning, De-catheters.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.370
How we feeling?

11:02.912 --> 11:05.039
Where's Marisol?
You know she's never late.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.416
Yeah, where is our team captain?

11:07.500 --> 11:11.295
Uh, that's a great question, Grace. Uh...

11:11.629 --> 11:13.506
Where is Marisol?

11:15.925 --> 11:19.387
Uh, it's a very interesting,
kinda surprising turn of events.

11:19.470 --> 11:20.888
Dude, just rip off the Band-Aid.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.849
Marisol is an honor student,

11:23.933 --> 11:27.144
and she is now part of the honors team.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.523
Now, where were we?

11:31.315 --> 11:35.403
What? Where were we?
Where are we? We're doomed.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.948
[stammers] I hate to say this,
but even my confidence is shaken.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.826
And that never happens.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.704
Look, look, nobody panic, okay?

11:44.787 --> 11:46.872
All we gotta do is clone Marisol.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.792
Mikey, give me a piece of her hair.
I know you got one.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.003
Look, Marisol was an important part
of our team,

11:53.087 --> 11:54.922
but she's not our whole team, okay?

11:55.005 --> 11:55.923
You guys have put in the work,

11:56.006 --> 11:58.175
and you're gonna do a great job,
with or without her.

11:58.759 --> 12:02.221
This is impossible.
This is like the Blowfish without Hootie.

12:05.015 --> 12:07.143
Nobody wants to see the Blowfish.

12:09.895 --> 12:10.980
I miss Marisol.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.649
You miss Marisol
when she sharpens her pencil.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.027
I sure do. Okay, pencil sharpener
is all the way over there.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.822
But now, we can elect a new captain.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.741
Lorenzo, what about you?

12:21.824 --> 12:22.700
Ha!

12:22.783 --> 12:25.619
Yeah, right.
That is a trap. The last one vanished.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.920
[chuckles] Hey, look, man.
It's like we're on a game show.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.589
Hey, wanna play some ghetto Family Feud?

12:38.632 --> 12:40.342
Oh, you mean, Family Feud?

12:41.635 --> 12:42.470
Okay.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.806
[imitating Steve Harvey] Uh, Mr. Ochoa,

12:45.890 --> 12:48.642
the top three answers is on the board.

12:50.311 --> 12:54.023
Ways to not pay your electric bill.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.775
[imitates buzzer]

12:55.858 --> 12:56.859
Um...

12:56.942 --> 13:00.613
Post-dated check,
run an extension cord to your neighbors,

13:00.696 --> 13:02.448
put the bill in your baby's name.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.908
[chuckles]

13:04.325 --> 13:05.618
That is correct.

13:05.701 --> 13:10.331
Uh, number one answer was,
"Move out before they catch yo' ass."

13:11.248 --> 13:12.958
[chuckles, in normal voice] This is cool.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.586
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
How about some ghetto Jeopardy?

13:15.669 --> 13:17.963
Okay, okay.
Okay, all right, here we go. Uh-huh.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.007
Time for the musical Daily Double.

13:20.090 --> 13:23.969
-Please complete this Cypress Hill lyric:
-Okay.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.472
"Who you trying to get crazy with, ese?"

13:26.972 --> 13:28.390
Oh! [imitates buzzer]

13:28.474 --> 13:31.227
Uh, what is "Don't you know I'm loco?"

13:31.644 --> 13:33.145
-Correct.
-[laughs]

13:34.230 --> 13:35.272
Hey, you see, bro?

13:35.564 --> 13:38.359
Look, no matter what happens,
this decathlon is gonna be fun.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.152
Are you still gonna have fun
if I beat you?

13:40.236 --> 13:42.321
We got Marisol now,
you're not gonna beat me.

13:42.613 --> 13:43.823
[sighs]

13:43.989 --> 13:46.450
-How is my girl?
-She fits right in with the honors kids.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.828
-Hmm.
-She's motivated, she's smart.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.455
Doesn't interrupt me
while I'm busy reading the racing forum.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.710
Bro, I know I did the right thing,
so, uh, why doesn't it feel better?

13:57.294 --> 13:59.672
It never does. That's why I never do it.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.093
[Paula sighs]

14:05.219 --> 14:08.305
My last academic decathlon at Wilson.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.392
You know, my walk-out music
needs to be dignified.

14:11.809 --> 14:16.021
It should be befitting
an Elite 100 administrator.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.691
I'm thinking Ol' Dirty Bastard's
"Baby, I Like It Raw."

14:20.943 --> 14:23.737
Well, nothing screams dignity
like "Big Baby Jesus."

14:23.821 --> 14:25.656
Yeah. [laughs]

14:27.199 --> 14:30.202
What you did with Marisol
showed true leadership, Gabe.

14:30.286 --> 14:34.415
She's gonna thank you when she graduates,
from here and from Stanford.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.293
I feel like I couldn't do what was best
for Marisol

14:37.376 --> 14:39.211
and still take care of my other kids.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.714
I just wish I could've seen my team
at full strength, you know?

14:42.214 --> 14:45.467
Yeah, I wanna see my team
at full strength too.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.888
That's why I'm offering a leader like you
a job at Lakewood.

14:49.763 --> 14:52.516
How does head of history department sound?

14:52.600 --> 14:56.395
I don't know, Lakewood Lancer? Ooh.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.982
Sounds fancy. And lancy.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.737
You did what was best for Marisol.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.614
Now, you gotta do what's best for Gabe.

15:06.697 --> 15:09.992
What's best for me is being
where I can make the biggest difference.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.578
You know how flight attendants
tell parents

15:12.661 --> 15:13.996
to put their oxygen mask on first?

15:14.079 --> 15:15.915
-Mm-hmm.
-That's what you need to do.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.499
Take care of Gabe,

15:17.583 --> 15:20.294
and you can make an even bigger difference
for everyone else.

15:20.544 --> 15:21.879
Well, the joke's on you,

15:21.962 --> 15:23.923
'cause you already grabbed a parachute
and jumped.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.342
But this plane isn't going down.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.428
Oh, really? Carlos is your new pilot.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.221
[chuckles] Mayday, Mayday!

15:32.598 --> 15:36.393
So, you ready to jump out that door
into the safety of Lakewood?

15:36.477 --> 15:39.813
[sighs] I'm sorry, Paula,
but if Carlos is getting your job,

15:39.897 --> 15:42.441
I need to be here
to protect the kids from him.

15:42.566 --> 15:45.277
And I need to be here to protect Carlos
from those kids.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.154
[clicks tongue]

15:52.284 --> 15:53.577
Do I smell sulfur?

15:54.370 --> 15:56.997
Ever notice how that smell
kinda follows you around?

15:58.958 --> 16:03.253
I'm just lighting candles for my shrine
to Paula to convince her to stay.

16:04.755 --> 16:07.174
This is a clear violation
of the fire code.

16:07.591 --> 16:10.970
More like a violation
of the "I want Paula's job" code,

16:11.762 --> 16:13.555
ladder-climbing jackass.

16:14.890 --> 16:19.353
The only fire I like is firing
obsolete employees. A-boom.

16:20.896 --> 16:21.897
But, Carlos,

16:21.981 --> 16:23.399
look what it spells.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.026
[Carlos] "Don't go." [gasps]

16:26.443 --> 16:27.569
How adorkable.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.949
Oh, candles. ♪ Happy birthday ♪

16:32.032 --> 16:33.158
No, Paula, Paula,

16:33.242 --> 16:35.911
I just want you to know how I feel.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.538
And how much you mean to me.

16:37.621 --> 16:38.580
Fire in the hole!

16:38.664 --> 16:41.834
Don't you dare, you mother-clucking
son of a biscuit!

16:44.294 --> 16:45.963
What the hell are you doing, Carlos?

16:46.046 --> 16:48.507
Solving problems. It's called leadership.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.592
And I don't want anyone
questioning my authority.

16:51.385 --> 16:55.139
Well, if this is what it's gonna be like
with you in charge, I'm retiring.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.267
Margaritaville, here I come.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.900
Congrats on joining the winning team.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.527
Congrats on having me.

17:09.820 --> 17:14.783
Here's a pro tip. First rule of honors,
every person for themselves.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.577
Damn it!

17:16.827 --> 17:19.204
Does this mean
we're not gonna be besties?

17:20.581 --> 17:22.207
It sure does. [chuckles]

17:22.291 --> 17:24.043
Backpack, let's roll.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.468
Is her backpack a Tesla?

17:34.136 --> 17:36.722
If you came to ask how it's going,
it blows.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.850
Really? So, you think
we have a chance at beating you?

17:39.933 --> 17:41.977
No, oh my God, honors is gonna crush you.

17:43.562 --> 17:46.899
But they're not a team.
They're a bunch of selfish, catty snobs.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.567
But the way they look out for themselves,

17:48.650 --> 17:51.153
I bet they're gonna get into
their first-choice schools.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.073
Who cares? They're so terrible,
Whitney's the nice one.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.283
Ew.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.994
Look, I wanna win,
but not with the honors kids.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.206
It's like Harry Potter winning
the Quidditch Cup with team Slytherin.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.793
I'm sorry, I read the bootleg version
from the swap meet.

18:08.045 --> 18:11.340
I think it was called
Geraldo Potter and the Chancla of Fire.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.095
Look, you on the honors team is
a sure thing.

18:16.178 --> 18:19.348
Exactly,
but it's not about winning and losing.

18:19.431 --> 18:22.476
The best thing for me is being where
I can make the biggest difference.

18:23.685 --> 18:24.937
It's a good place to be. 

18:25.646 --> 18:28.774
But I thought we decided that, you know,
you needed to put yourself first.

18:29.066 --> 18:32.319
Well, I don't remember deciding that,

18:32.402 --> 18:35.114
but even if I did, I've changed my mind.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.950
Ah. Whose terrible idea was that?

18:38.033 --> 18:39.284
Some dummy.

18:40.035 --> 18:43.038
Yeah, some pendejo who thought
he was doing the right thing.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.708
And now, he realizes he's gotta
get you back to where you wanna be.

18:47.835 --> 18:48.961
Only one problem:

18:49.044 --> 18:51.380
I don't think the Musketeers
are gonna take you back.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.509
Really? 'Cause I have like 75 texts
from Mikey that say otherwise.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.221
Well, then we got a decathlon to win,

18:59.304 --> 19:02.432
and you got a puppy who can't wait
for his owner to get home.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.602
-Marisol!
-Mikey, down!

19:10.232 --> 19:12.651
[sighs] Oh, hey, Paula.

19:12.943 --> 19:13.902
Hey, Gabe.

19:14.069 --> 19:14.987
Um...

19:25.455 --> 19:26.707
You're really going out on top.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.792
That is my favorite position.

19:31.378 --> 19:35.132
You know, I'm really gonna miss
these awkward moments when you overshare.

19:36.717 --> 19:40.262
Ah, but even by your high standards,
you've had quite a semester.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.221
I did.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.766
My kids haven't stopped talking about
when Miss Mads taught them.

19:45.184 --> 19:49.188
If I'd have had another week, I would've
covered Paula Abdul and MC Skat Kat.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.274
And don't forget, you and Coach Dixon,

19:52.357 --> 19:54.318
you put together
quite the football program

19:54.401 --> 19:55.819
that finally beat Poly.

19:56.862 --> 19:57.863
Yeah, I did do that.

19:57.946 --> 20:00.991
And nobody hosts a decathlon
or a talent show the way you do.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.576
-Right?
-Mm-hmm.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.245
It's gonna be weird watching Carlos
host those events.

20:06.038 --> 20:06.914
Wait, what?

20:08.081 --> 20:09.791
And you know
what the worst part's gonna be?

20:10.250 --> 20:12.920
What could be worse
than Carlos hosting anything?

20:13.170 --> 20:18.759
All of those Paula's Pals getting
counseled out by Principal Hernandez.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.931
Damn it, Gabriel.

20:24.765 --> 20:25.641
What? What did I do?

20:26.767 --> 20:31.813
I tried to convince you to come with me, 
and you twisted everything around.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.483
Now I can't leave.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.109
Yes!

20:38.403 --> 20:39.238
Paula...

20:41.240 --> 20:43.075
I am just a teacher...

20:44.701 --> 20:46.703
standing in front of an administrator...

20:47.454 --> 20:50.123
asking her from the bottom of my heart:

20:50.207 --> 20:51.250
Please, stay.

20:52.084 --> 20:52.918
Okay.

20:54.378 --> 20:55.504
I did it!

20:58.840 --> 21:00.842
Yep, white girl magic.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.306
[bell dings]

21:06.390 --> 21:10.060
The ratio of the circumference
of a circle to its diameter is pi.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.228
Correct.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.648
Man, I thought I knew everything
about pie.

21:16.858 --> 21:20.195
Whitney Carson representing. You go, girl.

21:20.404 --> 21:24.074
And the score is, the honors students, 50!

21:24.157 --> 21:27.035
And surprise, surprise,
the non-honors students a mere 25.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.664
Throwing shade at children,

21:30.998 --> 21:32.124
look at him go.

21:34.960 --> 21:39.256
I just want you all to know, I couldn't be
more proud of you than I am right now.

21:39.339 --> 21:41.633
Really? We're down by 25.

21:41.717 --> 21:44.469
Wouldn't you be more proud of us
if we were up by 25?

21:44.553 --> 21:48.348
Yeah, "I couldn't be more proud of you"
definitely means we're gonna lose.

21:49.224 --> 21:51.393
Listen, you guys got this.
Look over there.

21:51.977 --> 21:56.648
Those honors students are a really
smart group of individuals.

21:56.732 --> 21:57.691
But we're a team.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.820
Exactly. Believe in each other,
and anything is possible.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.072
It's time for the final round!

22:04.489 --> 22:07.117
Unless you're forfeiting
and cutting straight to the crying.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.827
[silently mouthing]

22:09.619 --> 22:11.121
See? Nobody thinks we can win this.

22:11.204 --> 22:13.707
Everybody, bring it in.
On the count of three.

22:14.708 --> 22:18.587
[all] One, two, three.
All for one and one for all!

22:19.963 --> 22:22.174
What is Emancipation Proclamation?

22:23.050 --> 22:26.136
Mikey, please phrase your answer
in the form of an answer.

22:26.928 --> 22:27.929
But that is correct!

22:28.555 --> 22:29.431
Yeah!

22:32.726 --> 22:35.103
Uh, Aphrodite's boo, Adonis.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.023
I know that
because that's what the ladies call me.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.317
Correct.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.820
Yeah! Come on! Bingo, Bango!

22:49.659 --> 22:50.827
Where did he come from?

22:53.914 --> 22:54.956
[bell dings]

22:55.040 --> 22:57.209
The answer is Schrödinger's cat.

22:57.292 --> 22:58.752
It is both alive and dead.

22:59.669 --> 23:00.587
Chew on that.

23:02.714 --> 23:03.715
Correct.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.179
The answer is trinitrotoluene.

23:09.262 --> 23:11.098
Wrong. It's TNT.

23:11.181 --> 23:13.642
And what do you think "TNT" stands for?

23:14.309 --> 23:15.394
She's right, Carlos.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.479
And boom goes the dynamite!

23:21.566 --> 23:23.819
Come on, Mr. Ochoa,
say something inspiring.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.070
Bring it in.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.825
You're making me look bad,
you're blowing it,

23:29.908 --> 23:31.368
and you cost me 50 bucks.

23:32.369 --> 23:33.328
Now, break.

23:35.997 --> 23:39.292
How many women have served
as Supreme Court justice?

23:39.376 --> 23:41.294
Four. Sandra Day O'Connor,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,

23:41.378 --> 23:43.088
Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan.

23:43.296 --> 23:44.256
Correct!

23:44.339 --> 23:45.799
[chuckles]

23:45.882 --> 23:48.260
All rise, all rise, all rise.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.887
The score is 50-50,

23:50.971 --> 23:52.597
just like my divorce settlements.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.099
[chuckles]

23:57.686 --> 23:59.438
We are going to a tie-breaker.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.106
How is this happening?

24:01.189 --> 24:04.151
This competition is tighter
than my spanx after Sizzler.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.404
Hey, if we win this,
I'm taking you guys to Sizzler.

24:08.655 --> 24:12.492
And the category is: classical composers.

24:12.909 --> 24:13.827
Oh, man.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.078
You got this, Walt.

24:17.873 --> 24:21.334
What German composer's only opera
was Fidelio?

24:21.418 --> 24:22.919
-[bell dings]
-Richard Wagner.

24:23.003 --> 24:23.962
Incorrect.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.883
[chuckles] You've gotta be kidding me.

24:28.467 --> 24:32.721
Do I look like someone who jokes during
the tie-breaker of an academic decathlon?

24:32.846 --> 24:34.139
Mm-hmm.

24:36.516 --> 24:38.518
Mr. Dobbs, for the win.

24:39.352 --> 24:40.187
Uh...

24:45.442 --> 24:46.818
"No Women, No Cry."

24:47.819 --> 24:50.363
Bob Marley. Marley and Me.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.574
Dog movie, Beethoven!

24:52.657 --> 24:55.202
I got it. Ludwig van Beethoven.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.162
Goodnight, Long Beach!

24:59.247 --> 25:00.665
That is... correct!

25:00.749 --> 25:03.793
[all cheering, clapping]

25:08.465 --> 25:12.302
The Musketeers, AKA Paula's Pals, win!

25:12.802 --> 25:15.013
[mic clatters, feedback whines]

25:18.475 --> 25:21.061
I promise you, nonsense like this
won't happen on my watch.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.103
You know what?

25:22.187 --> 25:25.690
You're right, it won't.
Because your watch has just been canceled.

25:26.942 --> 25:27.984
Paula's staying.

25:28.652 --> 25:29.611
A-boom.

25:33.281 --> 25:36.034
Hey, remember before when I said
I couldn't be prouder of you guys?

25:36.117 --> 25:38.578
Well, turns out I could, and I am!

25:41.164 --> 25:42.249
Hey, get over here.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.668
You did it. Look at your team.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.295
[clicks tongue]
Sure feels good to make a big difference.

25:47.712 --> 25:50.298
Ah, you didn't just make a difference,
you were the difference.

25:51.174 --> 25:52.092
No.

25:52.467 --> 25:53.301
You were.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.222
Thanks, Mr. Iglesias.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.106
[sighs]

26:08.316 --> 26:10.235
Don't gloat. I'm very vulnerable.

26:10.318 --> 26:12.696
Come on, bro. I'm not here to gloat.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.740
I think our Electric Slide
in the parking lot already did that.

26:16.783 --> 26:17.784
We had a great match. 

26:18.201 --> 26:19.160
No, we didn't.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.580
My eggheads cracked
when it mattered most.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.707
But, hey, no more Mr. Nice Guy.

26:24.374 --> 26:26.084
Oh, wait, so, what are you saying?

26:26.167 --> 26:27.961
You're finally gonna start trying?
Thank you.

26:28.044 --> 26:29.504
Look, I gotta keep the honors gig.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.506
Sure don't want to have to work
as hard as you do.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.300
So, let me get this straight.

26:33.383 --> 26:36.303
You're gonna work harder
so you can keep working less?

26:36.886 --> 26:40.140
I will work my butt off,
as long as it means I can coast.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.184
Do you ever listen to yourself?

26:45.145 --> 26:46.021
Hey, Gabe.

26:46.104 --> 26:49.274
I wanna thank you for showing me
a new side of Rakeem.

26:49.357 --> 26:54.279
But when football season rolls around,
all this teen Jeopardy doo-doo is over.

26:54.362 --> 26:56.823
Coach, I think Rakeem
is smart enough to do both.

26:56.906 --> 26:59.534
And risk everything? No, gracias.

27:00.535 --> 27:03.955
Answering questions at a podium
isn't risky, it doesn't require a helmet.

27:04.039 --> 27:04.873
Ha!

27:04.956 --> 27:07.626
Back when I was playing,
our helmets barely had any padding.

27:09.169 --> 27:10.545
That explains a lot.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.381
Hey, can I get you a drink? 

27:14.049 --> 27:16.843
Ooh, I'm all set. Maybe a little more ice?

27:19.971 --> 27:22.057
Hey, Katie. The usual.

27:22.140 --> 27:25.143
We are here to celebrate
Wilson's big victory.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.604
Both teams were from Wilson, Paula.

27:27.687 --> 27:30.357
Oh, I'm not talking about the kids,
I'm talking about me.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.817
Mama's staying, so we're gonna get turnt!

27:33.818 --> 27:36.196
It's a school night, maybe we sh-urnt.

27:37.697 --> 27:39.908
Mr. Iglesias,
what you did with those delinquents

27:39.991 --> 27:41.701
was nothing short of a miracle.

27:42.077 --> 27:45.497
What would be an even bigger miracle is
if you stopped calling them delinquents.

27:45.830 --> 27:48.750
Carlos,
I know you didn't get your big promotion,

27:48.833 --> 27:50.335
but I do have good news.

27:50.418 --> 27:52.379
I get to say the morning announcements.

27:52.462 --> 27:56.132
No. I've decided
to reinstate the theater program.

27:56.216 --> 28:00.053
I'm gonna call it Paula's Players.
And you're in charge.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.763
Hello, Dolly!

28:02.722 --> 28:04.599
Barmaid, your finest sherry.

28:05.308 --> 28:06.309
Her name's Katie.

28:08.019 --> 28:10.021
Hey, listen, I'd like to make a toast.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.358
To Paula, deciding to stay here at Wilson.

28:13.441 --> 28:17.654
Well, a very special teacher gave me
a compelling reason why.

28:18.571 --> 28:22.450
Well, I don't wanna take all the credit,
but you're welcome.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.868
[chuckles]

28:24.202 --> 28:26.371
Wilson would not be the same
without you, Paula.

28:26.454 --> 28:27.288
That's right.

28:27.372 --> 28:31.376
So, here's to an epic fall semester
and the best group of co-workers

28:31.459 --> 28:32.460
a guy could ask for.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.504
-Yay!
-Here, here. Cheers.

28:34.587 --> 28:38.883
Just because I'm not retiring doesn't mean
I can't visit Margaritaville.

28:40.301 --> 28:43.596
-All right, everybody. Let's bring it in.
-I suppose you want me to take the photo?

28:43.680 --> 28:45.765
Are you kidding? You're in this picture.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.767
Oh, hush that fuss.

28:48.309 --> 28:51.980
Okay, smilesies, everybody.
We made it to the end.

28:52.522 --> 28:53.523
Get in here.

28:55.191 --> 28:56.192
[camera shutter snaps]

28:59.904 --> 29:02.115
-Okay, what about People's Court? Okay.
-Okay.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.702
[both humming The People's Court theme]

29:09.581 --> 29:13.752
Hey, Your Honor, este-- he come home

29:13.835 --> 29:16.463
at two o'clock in the morning,

29:16.546 --> 29:19.299
smelling like Dos Equis and culo.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.136
It's cologne, Your Honor, cologne.

29:23.219 --> 29:25.472
Cologne spray for a horse!

29:26.931 --> 29:30.059
He come home with hickeys,
Your Honor, hickeys.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.103
I have eczema, Your Honor.

29:33.313 --> 29:37.776
He also had the glitter, the glitter.
From the putas, Your Honor.

29:40.278 --> 29:43.156
I was helping my kids
with the arts and crafts.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.493
That's why I stab him.

29:46.576 --> 29:47.535
¡Malo!

29:50.622 --> 29:53.041
[theme song playing]
