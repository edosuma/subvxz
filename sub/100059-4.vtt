WEBVTT

00:05.875 --> 00:08.573
- So the takeaway is,
just never ask a customer

00:08.617 --> 00:09.444
when she's due.

00:09.487 --> 00:12.273
And, finally, some big news.

00:12.316 --> 00:13.709
Are you ready for this?

00:13.752 --> 00:14.927
- How should we know?

00:14.971 --> 00:16.494
- Yeah, it kind of depends
what the news is.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.105
- Guys,
the more we talk about it,

00:18.148 --> 00:19.497
the more it won't live up
to the hype.

00:19.541 --> 00:21.021
Let's just get it over with.
Amy.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.674
- Thank you, Garrett.

00:22.718 --> 00:25.460
The West Concord Mall...

00:25.503 --> 00:26.548
is closing.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.941
- Oh.
- The mall's gone?

00:30.160 --> 00:31.814
- Really?
- That's crazy.

00:31.857 --> 00:35.209
I lost my virginity there
and a lipstick I really liked.

00:35.252 --> 00:36.819
- Wait, so you're telling me
I have to go

00:36.862 --> 00:38.690
all the way to the airport
to get Sbarro's?

00:38.734 --> 00:40.649
- I got my ears pierced
at the Claire's there,

00:40.692 --> 00:43.043
and then that's where Emma got
her ears pierced.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.131
Can't wait to tell her
that story

00:44.174 --> 00:45.393
so she can say,
"Cool story, Mom,"

00:45.436 --> 00:46.959
without looking up
from her cell phone.

00:47.003 --> 00:49.788
Anyway...
Glenn, are you okay?

00:51.573 --> 00:54.402
- We did it, Dina.
- We  did it.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.714
- I've been fighting that mall
for 40 years.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.499
It undercut
my dad's hardware store.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.240
It darn near took
this place under.

01:06.283 --> 01:08.503
It took my youth.

01:08.546 --> 01:10.070
It took my body.

01:10.113 --> 01:12.637
- In what sense?

01:12.681 --> 01:15.118
- I think the point is that
from a business perspective,

01:15.162 --> 01:17.077
this is really good news
for us.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.035
- Oh, yeah,
the death of retail--

01:19.079 --> 01:21.211
that's great news
for our store.

01:21.255 --> 01:22.560
- Sorry I'm late.

01:22.604 --> 01:26.825
- Carol.
Hey, welcome back.

01:26.869 --> 01:29.350
New look.
- New outlook.

01:29.393 --> 01:32.135
Sedona changed everything
for me.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.920
Or maybe I should say
it allowed me

01:34.964 --> 01:38.098
to access the change
that was already there.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.275
-  I think
we should drug-test her.

01:46.367 --> 01:49.021
- So I realized the best way
to attract a mall crowd

01:49.065 --> 01:50.762
is to mall this place up.

01:50.806 --> 01:53.025
I had them spray a bunch
of knockoff perfume everywhere.

01:53.069 --> 01:55.593
I put some massage chairs
over on the breezeway.

01:55.637 --> 01:57.421
We're giving away
free ear piercings,

01:57.465 --> 01:59.031
and I had them bring in
the water fountain

01:59.075 --> 02:00.250
from the Garden Center.

02:00.294 --> 02:03.471
- The mall had all this stuff
in one place?

02:03.514 --> 02:04.950
- Yeah, I mean,
I'm working with what we have.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.691
It's not like I can put
a movie theater in here.

02:06.735 --> 02:10.434
- The mall had movies, too?

02:10.478 --> 02:12.784
It sounds terrible.
I'm glad it's gone.

02:12.828 --> 02:14.743
- And you know how mall walkers
love their free food.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.484
Well, I bumped up
our sample stations.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.442
Guess how many.
- You want me to guess how many

02:18.486 --> 02:20.009
free sample stations
you arranged?

02:20.052 --> 02:21.010
- Okay, never mind.
It was dumb.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.185
I'm embarrassed.
- I mean, I guess

02:22.229 --> 02:23.447
I got to say three.
- Four.

02:23.491 --> 02:24.535
- Four?
- Is that a record?

02:24.579 --> 02:26.624
- I mean,
corporate thought so.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.278
- It's badass you got them
to okay that.

02:28.322 --> 02:29.888
- It's pretty cool, right?

02:29.932 --> 02:32.195
- Amy, it is so cool.

02:33.588 --> 02:35.285
- Oh, hey, man,
Colleen and I went

02:35.329 --> 02:36.939
to that Cuban place
you recommended.

02:36.982 --> 02:39.898
- Oh, the place I said would be
good for a double date.

02:39.942 --> 02:42.249
So you--you two went,
just, uh--just the two of you.

02:42.292 --> 02:43.685
- Yeah.
- Huh.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.991
So I guess you didn't get
to have the combo platter--

02:46.035 --> 02:48.168
the signature dish,
serves four.

02:48.211 --> 02:49.604
- No, we ordered that.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.301
We just shared it with
the couple sitting next to us.

02:51.345 --> 02:53.564
- Great, that sounds fun.
- Ugh.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.175
- How's the job search going?

02:55.218 --> 02:57.002
- Well, I need something
that's cash only

02:57.046 --> 02:58.221
and under the table,

02:58.265 --> 02:59.570
and I'm not willing to clean
anyone's garage

02:59.614 --> 03:01.311
in my underwater,
so my options are limited.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.661
- Well, you know,
I-I could just front you a--

03:03.705 --> 03:04.836
- Thanks, but I'm not
your charity case.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.229
You want to feel good
about yourself,

03:06.273 --> 03:08.013
go teach some
inner-city kids poetry.

03:08.057 --> 03:09.493
- Well, the joke's on you,

03:09.537 --> 03:11.452
'cause they actually ended up
teaching me, you know.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.018
And--and it wouldn't be
charity.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.455
It's just an advance.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.196
You pay me back when you can.
- I don't need any help.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.893
I am gonna figure this out
on my own.

03:17.936 --> 03:19.199
So new subject, please.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.766
- So, uh, you guys watching

03:21.810 --> 03:23.420
"Jersey Shore:
Family Vacation"?

03:23.464 --> 03:25.030
- I'm not really watching
anything.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.728
I mean, it's so hard to focus.
I'm so worried about money.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.686
- So just let me--
- No.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.558
- There are
so many extra bodies in here,

03:30.601 --> 03:31.950
I had to call corporate
and ask them

03:31.994 --> 03:33.343
to turn the thermostat down.

03:33.387 --> 03:37.086
They refused.
But I bet we're raking it in.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.087
- You know, funny
you should say that.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.741
I just checked, and no.

03:39.784 --> 03:41.699
- No?
How?

03:41.743 --> 03:43.875
I mean, we have all this
extra mall traffic.

03:43.919 --> 03:46.574
- Yeah, well, mall people
don't buy, they hang.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.271
I hate people that treat
shopping like an adventure.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.534
Give me a shut-in
who needs a sponge.

03:50.578 --> 03:53.102
Anyway, should we start
rousting 'em?

03:53.145 --> 03:55.496
- Well, I'm not exactly sure
what rousting entails,

03:55.539 --> 03:56.932
but it wouldn't hurt
to remind them

03:56.975 --> 03:58.542
that the store is
for customers only.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.718
- Nice, I'll go warm up
for the rousting.

04:00.762 --> 04:04.069
Sandra, get those kids
off the massage chairs.

04:04.113 --> 04:05.549
- Those girls?

04:05.593 --> 04:07.290
They look like
they're from "Euphoria."

04:07.334 --> 04:08.726
- Well, they don't have
to go back there.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.859
They just have to get off
the chairs.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.295
- "Euphoria's" a show.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.862
- Whatever, there's a bunch
of teens in the café.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.516
We can start there.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.128
- ♪ Spend my time on it

04:19.171 --> 04:21.783
♪ Five-star,
gold-plated, VIP ♪

04:21.826 --> 04:24.612
♪ First class,
why shouldn't we be... ♪

04:24.655 --> 04:27.049
- Okay, kids, if you're not
gonna buy anything,

04:27.092 --> 04:29.356
I'm gonna have to ask you...

04:29.399 --> 04:32.881
- Um, I got to pee, guys.
I'll be right back.

04:34.491 --> 04:36.711
- Don't get me wrong.
I like that you're here.

04:36.754 --> 04:38.930
I just didn't think
you'd ever want to hang out

04:38.974 --> 04:40.149
at your mom's work.

04:40.192 --> 04:41.716
- Well, I tried to get them
to hang out

04:41.759 --> 04:43.108
in the parking lot
of Tony Rotundo's,

04:43.152 --> 04:44.675
but people wanted Wi-Fi.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.373
- By the way,
who are those girls?

04:46.416 --> 04:48.070
- Oh, those are
my drug-dealer friends.

04:48.113 --> 04:50.551
We sit in the pile of broken
bottles by the bleachers.

04:50.594 --> 04:53.118
- You're...you're joking.

04:53.162 --> 04:54.511
So am I.
I'm in on this.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.687
- Yeah, well, they're seniors,

04:56.731 --> 04:58.428
and they're finally letting me
hang out with them.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.996
And I was hoping you could be
cool about this,

05:01.039 --> 05:02.302
but, obviously--

05:02.345 --> 05:05.174
- No, no.
I-I-I can be cool.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.219
I'm being cool.
Just hang out.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.395
They won't even know
I'm your mom.

05:08.438 --> 05:10.353
You know, there's free samples.
It's dumb.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.789
Never mind.
That's stupid.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.749
But there are four stations,
and one of them's hummus.

05:14.792 --> 05:15.793
You love hummus.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.665
- Stop knowing
what I like.

05:17.708 --> 05:18.753
Ugh.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.323
That's them.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.715
Thanks for doing this,

05:24.759 --> 05:26.456
but don't tell them
I needed you.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.371
- Oh, I'm not even gonna
mention you.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.155
I mean, no offense,
but it'd be really weird

05:30.199 --> 05:31.374
if you came up.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.028
Hey, guys.

05:33.071 --> 05:36.379
Um, so I know this sucks,
but it'd be really chill

05:36.423 --> 05:38.338
if you could find
somewhere else to hang out.

05:38.381 --> 05:40.644
- "Chill"?
- Yeah.

05:40.688 --> 05:42.777
You know, so the customers
can try these out

05:42.820 --> 05:44.213
in case they want to buy them.

05:44.256 --> 05:45.823
- Sounds chill.

05:49.523 --> 05:52.352
I know.
These rules suck, right?

05:52.395 --> 05:54.179
That's why we're laughing.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.529
Totally.

06:00.229 --> 06:02.362
- Wait, is that about me?

06:02.405 --> 06:03.841
No, okay,
you don't get it.

06:03.885 --> 06:05.147
I'm cool.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.848
- You're okay.
You're okay.

06:10.892 --> 06:14.504
Trust me, don't look back.
It only adds to the shame.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.945
- Hey, gang, shame
about the mall closing.

06:20.989 --> 06:23.426
It's like America's declared
war on public spaces.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.472
Anyway, get out.

06:27.125 --> 06:30.868
Good joke, Dina.
Put that on TikTok.

06:30.912 --> 06:33.393
- What are you doing?
- Change of plans.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.960
Emma's hanging out
with her friends.

06:36.004 --> 06:39.050
- Wait, really?
That's Emma?

06:39.094 --> 06:41.270
Man, she has the least
memorable face I've ever seen.

06:41.313 --> 06:42.750
- Okay,
we're not kicking her out.

06:42.793 --> 06:44.578
- What, we're just gonna
let her flout the rules?

06:44.621 --> 06:46.318
I thought we were being
tough moms.

06:46.362 --> 06:47.929
- I haven't gotten to spend
much time with her lately.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.278
I'm so busy at work.

06:49.321 --> 06:51.193
So she's spending
most of her time with Adam,

06:51.236 --> 06:52.760
and then whenever
we are together,

06:52.803 --> 06:54.370
she's just annoyed with me.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.459
Like, the other day I said,
"You have a lovely smile."

06:56.503 --> 06:58.766
And she looked me in the eye
and said,

06:58.809 --> 07:00.550
"It skipped a generation."

07:00.594 --> 07:02.030
Like, why?

07:02.073 --> 07:03.553
- Because your mother has
an objectively better smile.

07:03.597 --> 07:04.946
I mean, she lights up a room.

07:04.989 --> 07:06.426
- It's a tricky time,

07:06.469 --> 07:07.905
and I don't want to
make it worse.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.777
- All right, look,
I'll give you a half an hour.

07:09.820 --> 07:12.693
But, Amy, understand
this is an infestation.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.477
Sure, the first termite
is cute,

07:14.521 --> 07:16.131
but if you let
more of them come,

07:16.174 --> 07:18.307
sooner or later,
bye-bye, houseboat.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.398
- Don't you have
a gambling problem?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.618
- It's the only way that I can
get him to take my money,

07:24.661 --> 07:27.621
and it's not gambling
when it's a sure thing.

07:28.883 --> 07:32.016
Uh--no, you're crazy, Garrett.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.496
I am 100% positive.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.977
So, yes, I will take you up
on that bet.

07:36.020 --> 07:38.936
- Okay, yes, 'cause this is
what is happening right now.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.764
- Hey, Mateo.
Mateo, come here.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.287
Settle something for us.

07:42.331 --> 07:45.639
So I just said that Cher has
obviously never won a Grammy,

07:45.682 --> 07:47.641
and Garrett is saying
that she has.

07:47.684 --> 07:51.296
- I'm sorry, the goddess Cher,
as in Cherilyn Sarkisian?

07:51.340 --> 07:52.863
- I assume.

07:52.907 --> 07:54.386
I swear she's never won one,

07:54.430 --> 07:56.345
and I will bet you 50 bucks
I'm right.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.651
- Okay.
- I want in on this.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.348
Cher absolutely has a Grammy.

07:59.391 --> 08:01.568
- Okay,
get ready to lose 50 bucks.

08:02.569 --> 08:05.485
- Although, 50 is a lot,

08:05.528 --> 08:07.443
and Jonah seems so sure.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.011
Uh...oh, God.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.013
Maybe Cher
doesn't have a Grammy.

08:12.056 --> 08:14.058
That's why she still works
so hard and keeps it so tight.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.539
- Don't overthink it, Mateo.
- Oh, you know what?

08:16.583 --> 08:19.194
I just remembered "Believe"...
- Mm-hmm.

08:19.237 --> 08:21.544
- That one was a bop.
I might be wrong.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.503
- Okay, stop second-guessing
yourself, Jonah.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.026
- But you just said--

08:25.069 --> 08:26.680
- I'm in.
50 bucks, no Grammy.

08:26.723 --> 08:29.073
- Oh, um, uh, okay.
Um...

08:29.117 --> 08:31.423
- And Cher has...

08:31.467 --> 08:33.382
- One Grammy.

08:33.425 --> 08:35.384
- For "Believe."

08:35.427 --> 08:38.866
- Damn it.
I needed that money.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.172
Oh, my God...

08:41.216 --> 08:44.219
I snubbed Cher.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.438
I didn't believe.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.789
- W-would you like me
in the picture?

08:48.832 --> 08:50.747
- Ew.

08:50.791 --> 08:53.402
- Oh, are you
Snapchatting that?

08:53.445 --> 08:55.665
You know, Snapchat, the app?

08:55.709 --> 08:57.188
- Okay, ma'am.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.844
I'm old!

09:00.888 --> 09:02.193
This is how it happens.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.456
All of a sudden, all the words
you know are wrong,

09:04.500 --> 09:07.068
and there's some band
on the radio called the Eagles.

09:07.111 --> 09:10.332
- Cheyenne, the Eagles are
a really famous band.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.855
- You've heard of them?

09:11.899 --> 09:14.379
- There's nothing wrong
with moving on

09:14.423 --> 09:16.164
to a new phase of life.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.382
Take me, for instance.

09:17.426 --> 09:18.688
I used to run this place,

09:18.732 --> 09:21.038
and now
I'm the free-sample guy.

09:21.082 --> 09:22.431
One of four.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.825
Oh, she's gonna try it.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.609
Huh?

09:27.828 --> 09:31.440
- And she did not like it,
not one bit.

09:31.483 --> 09:34.356
I guess she's just not a fan
of raisins.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.925
Oh, I...

09:37.968 --> 09:39.622
- Okay, full "disclozh"--

09:39.666 --> 09:41.755
I've never pierced
anyone's ears before,

09:41.798 --> 09:44.192
but you've never had
your ears pierced before.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.368
So we're in this together.

09:46.411 --> 09:49.240
So let's just close our eyes
and go for it.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.332
- As the manager here,

09:54.376 --> 09:57.161
I just wanted to welcome you

09:57.205 --> 09:59.729
with some muffins,

09:59.773 --> 10:03.167
and here are your receipts.

10:03.211 --> 10:05.909
Just hang on to those
in case any employees

10:05.953 --> 10:08.172
try to give you static
about not buying any.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.218
Ugh.
Lame-os.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.698
- Why are you being nice to us?

10:11.741 --> 10:14.744
- Just because I know
kids need to eat after school.

10:14.788 --> 10:17.660
Not because I have any.
I don't.

10:17.704 --> 10:21.011
I can't.
I rode too many horses.

10:21.055 --> 10:24.798
I'm an equestrian--
a champion equestrian.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.016
- Thanks for the muffins!
Bye!

10:26.060 --> 10:27.365
- Okay, bye.

10:27.409 --> 10:30.194
- Um, what was that about?
- Oh, it's nothing.

10:30.238 --> 10:32.370
- Look.

10:37.549 --> 10:40.161
- What are you doing?

10:40.204 --> 10:44.556
- I-I wanted to talk to you,
but I was scared,

10:44.600 --> 10:47.472
'cause you're very confident
like astronauts.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.997
- What?
That's so weird.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.520
- Say other things.

10:51.563 --> 10:54.697
- I don't--I don't what--um...

10:54.741 --> 10:57.091
I take the bus to work.
I have a cat.

10:57.134 --> 10:59.180
- Okay, I'm officially
obsessed with her.

10:59.223 --> 11:00.703
- Yeah.

11:00.747 --> 11:04.359
- Oh, so, will you come
out of those chairs for me?

11:04.402 --> 11:06.230
- We would die for you,
like, now.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.971
- Just the chairs are fine.

11:12.584 --> 11:15.805
Oh, Amy, you're very good.

11:15.849 --> 11:18.199
All right, this is how
this is gonna go.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.592
I'm gonna give you six minutes
to eat, then--five kids,

11:20.636 --> 11:23.160
two bathroom stalls,
two minutes per poop--

11:23.204 --> 11:25.902
at 4:39, you'll officially be
loiterers again.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.382
- You know what?
Let's just go.

11:27.425 --> 11:29.036
- No, no, no, hold on.

11:29.079 --> 11:31.125
I'm sorry my colleague here
hasn't heard

11:31.168 --> 11:32.343
the new store policy...

11:32.387 --> 11:33.562
- Amy...

11:33.605 --> 11:35.782
- Which is that there is
no minimum purchase,

11:35.825 --> 11:38.523
and you can stay
till the store is closed,

11:38.567 --> 11:40.395
and we're not gonna
bother you anymore.

11:40.438 --> 11:43.703
So, uh, just do whatever.

11:43.746 --> 11:46.183
- Really?
I got to text Blaze and Rustin.

11:46.227 --> 11:48.185
- Blaze andRustin?

11:48.229 --> 11:49.447
We're sunk.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.024
- Well, I hope your kid
stops hating you

12:01.068 --> 12:02.547
before the store's destroyed.

12:02.591 --> 12:06.073
- Okay, she doesn't hate me,
and it's really not that bad.

12:06.116 --> 12:09.293
And--oh, I hadn't seen
what they'd done to the robot.

12:09.337 --> 12:10.599
- Always penises.

12:10.642 --> 12:13.080
Just once I'd like to see them
draw a vagina.

12:13.123 --> 12:15.560
Never mind.
There they are on the back.

12:15.604 --> 12:16.823
That's something.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.521
- She's killing it.

12:19.564 --> 12:20.740
- I'm just doing my job.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.567
- Oh, my God, who says that?

12:22.611 --> 12:24.004
I wish you were my mom.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.267
-  I wish they wished
I was their mom.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.138
- Don't feel so bad.

12:28.182 --> 12:31.576
I mean, sometimes people just
like who they like, you know?

12:31.620 --> 12:33.404
No one would have ever thought
that the cool kids

12:33.448 --> 12:35.015
would have liked me
in high school,

12:35.058 --> 12:36.364
but they loved me.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.975
Yeah, they always let me
give them gifts,

12:39.019 --> 12:40.977
and they helped
out of the locker

12:41.021 --> 12:43.066
when I somehow got
shoved inside.

12:43.110 --> 12:44.720
- They did that to you?

12:44.764 --> 12:47.636
- No, unidentified mean kids
did that.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.507
My cool friends were
always nearby

12:49.551 --> 12:51.031
laughing about something.

12:51.074 --> 12:52.772
- Oh, my God, you're right.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.774
Sandra's being mean-girled.

12:54.817 --> 12:57.037
Glenn, your story
made me so sad,

12:57.080 --> 12:58.603
but it was so helpful.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.431
- Oh.
Okay, terrific.

13:00.475 --> 13:03.521
- 50 bucks?
Oh, man, now you're talking.

13:03.565 --> 13:04.914
Mateo, get in on this.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.437
- I'm not betting
any more money.

13:06.481 --> 13:08.483
- Ah, come on, you're not
gonna win if you don't play.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.702
Besides, look at the--
look at the shot.

13:12.313 --> 13:14.706
Oh, yeah, there's no way
he's making that.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.056
I'm in.
- All right.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.361
All right.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.107
Oh, my God, I made it.

13:24.151 --> 13:26.893
- Damn it!
I'm down 100 bucks.

13:26.936 --> 13:28.111
- What the hell?
- I don't know, man.

13:28.155 --> 13:29.765
I didn't mean to, but...

13:29.809 --> 13:32.724
Did you guys see that shot?
- You didn't meant to?

13:32.768 --> 13:34.161
- Uh, Mateo's confused,

13:34.204 --> 13:35.945
and the rule in gambling is,
if anybody's confused,

13:35.989 --> 13:37.207
they get
all of their money back.

13:37.251 --> 13:38.687
- Wait, have you guys
just been trying

13:38.730 --> 13:40.123
to trick me into taking
your money?

13:40.167 --> 13:41.821
- Yes, that's exactly
what we were doing,

13:41.864 --> 13:43.083
but did you guys see the shot?

13:43.126 --> 13:44.171
That's what's important here.

13:44.214 --> 13:45.520
- So all this was a charity?

13:45.563 --> 13:47.870
- In practice, it was
a lot more like robbery.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.438
- Hey.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.136
- Oh, hey.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.225
How's it going
with your new friends?

13:55.269 --> 13:56.444
- Good.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.054
Yeah, I said lakes were cooler
than beaches,

13:58.098 --> 14:00.361
and it took a second,
but everyone agreed with me.

14:00.404 --> 14:03.103
- That's great.
I'm--I'm so happy for you.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.496
- Yeah, so, um, thanks

14:05.540 --> 14:08.891
for, like,
not being totally weird today.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.851
- Yeah, no, I mean...pssht...

14:11.894 --> 14:13.678
Of course.

14:13.722 --> 14:15.463
Like, whatever.

14:18.509 --> 14:21.730
- Hey, I just confiscated this.
It's been filled with bleach.

14:21.773 --> 14:24.907
Now, I'll be the first to
admit, that is a funny concept.

14:24.951 --> 14:27.518
But, come on, it's time
for these kids to go.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.956
- No, Dina,
it's going so well with Emma.

14:29.999 --> 14:33.046
She just told me
that I wasn't being too weird.

14:33.089 --> 14:34.264
- Congratulations.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.136
That said, we need to get them
out of here

14:36.179 --> 14:37.702
before something like this
happens.

14:37.746 --> 14:40.880
- Ooh, whoops.
Sorry about that.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.404
- Go re-vest
- Okay.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.928
Okay, fine. Do it.

14:45.972 --> 14:48.365
But if Emma asks,
you acted alone.

14:48.409 --> 14:49.453
- No problem.

14:49.497 --> 14:51.499
If I see and happen
to recognize Emma,

14:51.542 --> 14:52.630
I will pass that on.

14:55.982 --> 14:59.202
- Okay,
stop messing with Sandra.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.378
- Literally,
what are you talking about?

15:01.422 --> 15:02.771
- Oh, you know.

15:02.814 --> 15:05.556
You've got her all like,
"Oh, boy, somebody likes me,

15:05.600 --> 15:08.559
and I have something
to live for for once?"

15:08.603 --> 15:10.213
It's mean.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.867
- Was that supposed to be me?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.216
- Yeah,
I'm sticking up for you.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.392
Next thing, you're gonna be
going after her hair

15:15.436 --> 15:17.307
and, you know,
the way that she stands.

15:17.351 --> 15:20.441
- Oh, my God.
You're bullying her.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.965
- I've never met
an actual bully in real life.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.925
I thought they were just in,
like, old movies in the 1990s.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.970
- No, you're the bullies.

15:28.014 --> 15:31.321
- Ma'am, I hope
you find peace, okay?

15:32.540 --> 15:35.586
-  Oh.
No, no, no.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.937
- Oh, Mateo, you obviously
didn't have to--

15:37.980 --> 15:39.242
- I chose to make those bets.

15:39.286 --> 15:42.767
I'm gonna pay you
what I owe you.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.726
- $4.
- Slowly.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.467
Like, this is all my fault.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.121
I knew Jonah had
a gambling thing,

15:48.164 --> 15:49.992
but I just thought that meant
he was good at it.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.776
Why would you have a hobby
that you suck at?

15:51.820 --> 15:53.300
Okay, you know what?

15:53.343 --> 15:54.649
If I suck, why don't you just
bet against me this time?

15:54.692 --> 15:56.172
It'll give you a chance
to erase the debt.

15:56.216 --> 15:58.348
- No, thanks. You've messed
with me enough already.

15:58.392 --> 16:00.437
- Oh, come on, come on, we'll
just flip a coin, you know.

16:00.481 --> 16:01.961
If you win, then we're square.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.006
If you lose,
then, you know, whatever.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.574
Double screwed
is just screwed, right?

16:06.617 --> 16:08.010
- That's really smart.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.403
- Is it?

16:09.446 --> 16:10.491
- Heads.

16:14.147 --> 16:15.975
- It's heads.
both: Nice!

16:16.018 --> 16:18.064
- Okay.
Let's--let's do it again.

16:18.107 --> 16:19.500
- Are you sure?
'Cause this seems like

16:19.543 --> 16:20.805
a pretty good stopping point.
- 20 bucks?

16:20.849 --> 16:21.981
- Yeah, fine by me.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.199
Heads.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.856
Wow.
I am good at this.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.075
- Well, it's random luck.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.033
- No, it's not.
I have a system.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.382
- Of guessing heads, yeah.

16:32.426 --> 16:33.949
- Well, it keeps
beating you, so...

16:33.993 --> 16:36.169
-  Yeah, okay.
Okay, um, again.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.866
I'm assuming you want--
you want heads.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.346
- Got to follow my system.

16:40.869 --> 16:43.872
- And it's heads!
- Yeah!

16:43.915 --> 16:45.613
- You okay?
- Again.

16:45.656 --> 16:48.659
- Hey, guys.
Want to hear some hot goss?

16:48.703 --> 16:50.792
I'm gonna kick you the
out of the store.

16:50.835 --> 16:52.446
- What?
- You heard me.

16:52.489 --> 16:54.970
Pack up your SunnyDs and your
Tamagotchis and hit the road.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.190
- You're changing
the rules on us.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.757
Is this because of our age?
- Absolutely.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.933
- So it's discrimination.

17:01.977 --> 17:04.023
- What--what are you--
what are you doing?

17:04.066 --> 17:06.503
- Documenting injustice.
- Continue.

17:06.547 --> 17:10.551
You were saying this was
a discriminatory policy.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.901
- Why can't you
just kick them out?

17:12.944 --> 17:14.859
- I tried.
They started filming me.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.600
And I don't want
to become a meme

17:16.644 --> 17:19.081
like that racist barbecue woman
with the cool sunglasses.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.649
- So we have to make them
want to leave.

17:21.692 --> 17:25.087
So let's just think of places
that teens like to go.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.958
- That's easy.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.090
The hop.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.092
- How old are you?

17:30.136 --> 17:31.528
- Have we thought about using

17:31.572 --> 17:33.574
the teachings
of the Sacred Wheel

17:33.617 --> 17:36.490
to show them the
interconnectedness of all life?

17:36.533 --> 17:38.057
- Yes, Carol, we did try that.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.623
I think you were
in the bathroom.

17:39.667 --> 17:40.929
- Oh.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.496
- Hmm, what about,
like, the mall?

17:42.539 --> 17:44.715
- Eugene, you're excused.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.108
- Okay.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.939
- Oh, God,
they've breached.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.462
That's it.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.682
It's their store now.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.597
- What'd you say?

18:01.471 --> 18:02.820
- Let's go.
Again, again.

18:02.864 --> 18:05.649
- Heads.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.042
- What?

18:07.086 --> 18:08.174
- Okay, you know what?

18:08.217 --> 18:09.653
You're down 200 bucks.
Let's just stop.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.046
- No, no, no, no, no.
One more time, one more time.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.265
Double or nothing.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.745
If it's tails,
we all walk away even.

18:14.789 --> 18:16.921
- And if it's heads?
- It's not gonna be heads.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.358
Flip the coin.

18:21.012 --> 18:23.276
- It's heads.

18:23.319 --> 18:24.277
$400.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.975
Thank you guys so much.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.455
Oh, God,
it feels so much better

18:28.498 --> 18:30.152
winning this money fair
and square.

18:33.329 --> 18:37.159
- Feel good to help people?

18:37.203 --> 18:41.598
- Don't, uh, tell Amy
about this.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.253
- Gonna have to Febreze
that couch for a long time.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.560
- Hey, Cheyenne.

18:46.603 --> 18:48.083
You're young.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.780
Any ideas
on how we get rid of them?

18:49.824 --> 18:51.826
- I'm not young.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.741
Maybe I never was.

18:53.784 --> 18:56.787
- Well, you broke Cheyenne.
I hope you're happy.

18:56.831 --> 18:59.007
All to try and make your
daughter think you're cool.

18:59.050 --> 19:01.966
- No, I'm not trying to get
Emma to think I'm cool.

19:02.010 --> 19:05.013
I just don't want her to think
that I actively suck.

19:05.056 --> 19:07.320
- Mm, sorry,
but she's gonna.

19:07.363 --> 19:09.496
You're her mom.
She's a teenager.

19:09.539 --> 19:13.195
Back then, I thought my mom was
a dork, and she was in prison.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.676
-  Yeah, I guess
this is a losing battle.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.504
I mean, the more
I try and get to her,

19:17.547 --> 19:19.027
the further
she runs away.

19:19.070 --> 19:21.508
- Because you're lame.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.379
You're lame as hell.

19:23.423 --> 19:27.166
- In Emma's eyes.
- Among other places.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.993
Amy, the things
you've been suppressing

19:29.037 --> 19:30.604
are exactly what we need.

19:30.647 --> 19:33.215
You're not
some hip checked-out mom.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.522
You're a smothering, doting,
teary mess,

19:35.565 --> 19:38.046
and we need to show
those children that mess

19:38.089 --> 19:40.309
in all its horrifying glory.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.224
- ♪ You can kiss my

19:42.268 --> 19:44.052
♪ K-k-kiss my

19:44.095 --> 19:46.881
♪ You can tell lies

19:46.924 --> 19:49.405
- Uh, what is all this?

19:49.449 --> 19:53.061
- We just wanted to let you
know that we believe in you.

19:54.454 --> 19:57.283
- Uh, uh, why are you
taking my picture?

19:57.326 --> 19:58.806
- Mason, right?

19:58.849 --> 20:01.504
Congratulations, Mason.
You're our Teen of the Week.

20:01.548 --> 20:04.725
I'm gonna put this picture on
our website, on the Internet.

20:04.768 --> 20:07.162
- Ma'am, what are you doing?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.251
- Well, um...

20:09.295 --> 20:12.907
everybody,
I wanted to let you know

20:12.950 --> 20:15.562
that I am so proud of you...

20:15.605 --> 20:18.956
of who you are,
of who you're becoming.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.960
And even though there's
some distance between us--

20:23.004 --> 20:27.095
you know,
customers and employees--

20:27.138 --> 20:29.837
I know that,
ultimately, this...

20:29.880 --> 20:34.058
journey that you're on is
leading to a wonderful place.

20:34.102 --> 20:36.539
And I know I said that it was
possibly problematic

20:36.583 --> 20:37.758
that you're GarageBand beats

20:37.801 --> 20:39.673
had too many
African influences,

20:39.716 --> 20:42.632
but that was authentic to you,
so that is enough for me.

20:42.676 --> 20:47.071
And I am speaking
to all of you, obviously...

20:47.115 --> 20:49.073
metaphorically...

20:49.117 --> 20:50.771
and I love you.

20:50.814 --> 20:53.382
I love you so much.

20:53.426 --> 20:55.950
I love you all so much.

20:55.993 --> 20:58.300
- This sucks!

20:58.344 --> 21:00.737
Let's go check out
the parking lot.

21:00.781 --> 21:01.912
- Bye-bye.

21:01.956 --> 21:03.914
Come back tomorrow,
and we'll show you

21:03.958 --> 21:06.961
some educational videos
about your changing bodies.

21:07.004 --> 21:08.310
Well done, Amy.

21:08.354 --> 21:09.964
That was truly painful
to watch.

21:10.007 --> 21:11.357
- Yeah, that was brutal.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.142
If you were my mom, I'd never
talk to you again.

21:14.185 --> 21:16.318
- Thank you.
- Hey, Amy.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.580
Uh, I was just wondering

21:17.624 --> 21:20.453
if I could take off
just a-a teeny bit early.

21:20.496 --> 21:23.325
- Hmm.
