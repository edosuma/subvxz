00:12.336 --> 00:14.505
<i>The only person that's
gonna kill for these bonds</i>

00:14.505 --> 00:15.673
is the person
that can flip them.

00:15.673 --> 00:17.241
You're saying,
Milo's still out there?

00:18.342 --> 00:19.477
The fuck is that?

00:19.477 --> 00:20.845
I grabbed them.
We're good.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.247
I found the rat.

00:23.247 --> 00:24.248
Who is it?

00:24.248 --> 00:25.683
It was fucking Ben Morrisey.

00:25.683 --> 00:27.418
<i>Fucker,
he was in it with us.</i>

00:27.418 --> 00:30.755
Robert and his guys are heroes,
they saved our fucking lives.

00:30.755 --> 00:32.056
You know how this goes.

00:32.056 --> 00:33.791
I thought maybe it'd be nice for
us to get out

00:33.791 --> 00:35.326
for a bit of a field trip,
you know.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.228
Get you outta here for a minute,
get some fresh air.

00:37.228 --> 00:38.863
Would you like that?

00:38.863 --> 00:39.997
I would.

00:42.300 --> 00:43.768
You see this shit?

00:43.768 --> 00:46.537
They be swarming like
motherfucking bees.

00:51.209 --> 00:53.744
The field is level,
that means no fucking drones.

00:53.744 --> 00:56.314
We made a fucking deal.

00:59.250 --> 01:03.754
<i>Mike, you gotta
call me back, man.</i>

01:03.754 --> 01:05.022
<i>I fucking found her.</i>

01:07.992 --> 01:30.922
I found Iris.

03:09.287 --> 03:10.522
Dead.

03:11.222 --> 03:12.490
Fuck.

03:15.293 --> 03:16.427
He was my grandpa.

03:16.728 --> 03:17.996
I'm sorry.

03:17.996 --> 03:20.265
Yeah. He died two years ago.

03:21.299 --> 03:23.501
Guess I haven't been here
a while.

03:23.902 --> 03:25.937
Hey, uh, it's none
of my business,

03:25.937 --> 03:29.741
but, uh, guy like you
comes into a bar like this,

03:30.175 --> 03:32.644
drinking like Genghis Khan
went to war?

03:33.144 --> 03:34.345
I mean, you can keep
drinking that shit,

03:34.345 --> 03:38.049
but ain't enough in the bottle
to drown in, so...

03:38.883 --> 03:40.685
None of my business
to be telling a grown man

03:40.685 --> 03:42.453
how to live his life.

03:43.054 --> 03:44.789
You're right.

03:47.725 --> 03:49.994
None of your fucking business.

03:53.665 --> 03:55.200
I'm just taking a day.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.902
Nothing darker
or deeper than that.

04:01.506 --> 04:03.508
Take a pause, reset.

04:11.749 --> 04:14.118
I'm gonna leave you these, okay?

04:14.118 --> 04:15.920
And I'm gonna
come back for them,

04:15.920 --> 04:18.489
and it's your job
to tell me to fuck off.

04:19.390 --> 04:20.825
No matter what I say.

04:21.726 --> 04:24.229
Okay. How long are you gonna be?

04:24.863 --> 04:26.064
Long as it takes.

04:26.064 --> 04:28.600
Well, my shift is 10:00 to 6:00.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.134
Understood.

04:31.636 --> 04:35.240
Does your, uh, grandpa
still have the safe in the back?

04:36.541 --> 04:38.576
- Yeah.
- All right.

04:40.812 --> 04:42.180
What the fuck?

04:42.180 --> 04:44.082
What the... Are you
gonna fucking rob me?

04:44.082 --> 04:45.416
No, I'm not fucking robbing you.

04:45.416 --> 04:48.253
Put this back in the safe,
would you?

04:48.253 --> 04:50.722
And I'm gonna come back
for this.

04:51.155 --> 04:53.191
But this,
you're gonna give to me.

04:53.758 --> 04:55.093
Understand?

04:56.127 --> 04:58.463
Here. That's for you.

05:04.102 --> 05:05.503

09:05.576 --> 09:08.346
and he's really,
he's very fragile.

09:08.346 --> 09:10.248
He could use your help.

09:10.915 --> 09:14.252
Okay? Would you call me back

09:14.252 --> 09:16.220

15:45.458 --> 15:47.360
I see that.

15:47.693 --> 15:49.228
- Do you want a drink?
- No.

15:49.595 --> 15:51.998
Just wanna talk, two minutes.

15:53.332 --> 15:55.201
All right, baby bro.

15:56.469 --> 15:58.237
Let's you and me go talk.

16:04.610 --> 16:06.445
<i>I don't know
what to tell you, Ian.</i>

16:06.445 --> 16:07.780
<i>He said he'd only go with you.</i>

16:07.780 --> 16:09.982
Cracked his fucking tooth
right in half.

16:09.982 --> 16:12.818
These shit bags got
a better dental plan than I do.

16:13.386 --> 16:15.321
Eating rocks. You believe that?

16:15.721 --> 16:17.590
<i>Fucking loony tunes.</i>

16:17.590 --> 16:19.692
Oh, well, yeah.
I mean, if he's gotta go

16:19.692 --> 16:21.293
to the dentist, he's gotta go
to the dentist.

16:21.293 --> 16:25.031
I'll swing by right now,
pick him up.

16:25.531 --> 16:27.466
Yeah, I'll have him back
by 6:00.

16:27.466 --> 16:29.168
- <i>I'll see you in a bit.</i>
- Yeah.

16:35.574 --> 16:36.776
I mean, you don't think
it's strange

16:36.776 --> 16:39.478
that Mike wasn't there
to pick you up today?

16:39.478 --> 16:40.913
Yeah, that's fucking strange.

16:40.913 --> 16:43.449
And that he's not answering
his phone all fucking day?

16:43.449 --> 16:45.584
Hey, man, I feel you.
I really do.

16:45.584 --> 16:47.086
'Cause, I mean,
you're out, buddy.

16:47.319 --> 16:48.721
The Mexican dude, he's dead.

16:48.721 --> 16:51.657
AB and Bloods are still under
lock and fucking key.

16:52.958 --> 16:54.693
I mean, do you think
that one of those motherfuckers

16:54.693 --> 16:56.228
put a target on him?

16:56.962 --> 17:00.366
Yeah. It's possible.
But I ain't heard shit about it.

17:00.366 --> 17:01.767
Well, can you fucking check?

17:01.767 --> 17:03.903
- Yeah, I can fucking check.
- Good, when?

17:03.903 --> 17:05.704
Slow your roll, baby boy,
all right?

17:05.704 --> 17:07.139
You sure you ain't coked up
or some shit?

17:07.139 --> 17:08.841
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm just trying to figure out

17:08.841 --> 17:10.810
if my fucking brother is dead
or if some motherfucker

17:10.810 --> 17:12.411
out there is trying to kill him!

17:12.411 --> 17:15.047
It's scary out in this jungle,
ain't it?

17:16.282 --> 17:17.683
What?

17:19.652 --> 17:21.220
Not knowing.

17:21.987 --> 17:24.256
Not knowing
if a motherfucker you love

17:24.256 --> 17:25.758
is gonna make it home or not.

17:27.460 --> 17:29.762
Or not knowing
if some dumb motherfucker

17:29.762 --> 17:31.664
with a bad attitude and a .22

17:31.664 --> 17:34.166
is gonna end that story
right there.

17:36.235 --> 17:38.104
I'm gonna make some calls.

17:40.005 --> 17:43.175
Hit my boy up on the inside,
see if he's hearing shit.

17:50.015 --> 17:51.283
He was nice.

17:51.283 --> 17:54.987
Yeah, seemed like a good guy.
He didn't hurt you?

17:55.321 --> 17:57.289
No. I'm okay, Ian.

17:58.357 --> 18:00.226
That's good. That's good.

18:26.185 --> 18:27.419
Charlie.

18:27.419 --> 18:29.054
Is this your house?

18:29.822 --> 18:33.893
No, I just gotta, I just gotta
stop here for a second.

18:34.660 --> 18:36.095
<i>Wanna come in?</i>

18:37.696 --> 18:38.898
Really?

18:38.898 --> 18:40.900
Yeah. You think
you can be quiet?

18:41.634 --> 18:44.103
Okay. Thank you, Ian.

18:44.837 --> 18:46.272
All right. Okay.

18:47.873 --> 18:51.277
This one. There we go.

18:51.610 --> 18:53.212
I need you to put
these booties on here.

18:53.212 --> 18:55.814
- Okay.
- These gloves, that's it.

19:03.789 --> 19:05.291
Throw that on.

19:06.325 --> 19:08.127
Like my mom's.

19:20.673 --> 19:23.876
It's like
we're trick-or-treating.

19:35.854 --> 19:36.922
- Ian.
- Hey, Ben.

19:36.922 --> 19:38.691
Listen, I just need two seconds,

19:38.691 --> 19:40.893
if I could, real quick, just...

19:42.061 --> 19:43.762
Oh, uh, Charlie, come in.

19:43.762 --> 19:45.197
Just shut the door behind you.

19:45.197 --> 19:46.432
- Okay.
- All right?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.602
This is Charlie.
Charlie, say hi to Ben.

19:49.602 --> 19:50.970
Hello, Ben.

19:50.970 --> 19:52.404
Ian, what's going on?
What the fuck?

19:52.404 --> 19:54.039
I just have a dentist
appointment down the way.

19:54.039 --> 19:55.774
I needed to drop by real quick.

19:55.774 --> 19:57.109
I gotta get him back by 6:00.

19:57.109 --> 19:59.578
Just need to talk to you
for two seconds.

19:59.578 --> 20:00.913
- Come on, Charlie.
- All right.

20:00.913 --> 20:02.481
It'll take two seconds.

20:09.154 --> 20:10.723
Okay.

20:13.392 --> 20:15.261
Where's Linda and the kids?

20:17.062 --> 20:18.397
Costco.

20:19.632 --> 20:21.267
But they're gonna be
right back, man.

20:21.267 --> 20:23.335
I just wanna, you know,
talk to you

20:23.335 --> 20:24.570
off the record a little bit,

20:24.570 --> 20:26.639
maybe backchannel
some of this stuff,

20:26.639 --> 20:28.107
just two guys talking.

20:29.275 --> 20:30.542
No lawyers.

20:30.542 --> 20:32.911
No bullshit. Just real simple.

20:33.746 --> 20:34.980
Read that.

20:36.849 --> 20:38.751
Just take a look at it, Ben.

20:54.433 --> 20:56.068
Jesus.

21:00.105 --> 21:01.307
That him?

21:02.207 --> 21:03.309
Hey, Charlie.

21:06.178 --> 21:08.714
Seventeen counts of homicide.

21:08.714 --> 21:10.416
Home invasion.

21:10.883 --> 21:12.985
Forcible confinement.

21:12.985 --> 21:14.887
Dismemberment, desecration.

21:14.887 --> 21:16.822
It's a whole bunch
of rape stuff here,

21:16.822 --> 21:18.724
but I don't wanna say
that word in front of him.

21:18.724 --> 21:20.326
He knows what it means.

21:22.761 --> 21:24.396
This is fucked up, man.

21:24.396 --> 21:25.864
A little bit.

21:26.899 --> 21:28.834
Look, Robert is a good man.

21:29.234 --> 21:30.936
And he saved my fucking life.

21:31.236 --> 21:33.105
How the fuck
did you even get him out?

21:33.105 --> 21:35.808
<i></i> Question is,
when's he going back?

21:36.642 --> 21:38.210
Now he knows where you live.

21:42.548 --> 21:44.049
Look, man.

21:44.049 --> 21:47.219
I... I've already talked
to the DA. I mean, I don't...

21:47.219 --> 21:50.689
Call the DA's office, all right,
and you say you panicked.

21:50.689 --> 21:53.158
You say it was PTSD bullshit.

21:54.760 --> 21:58.430
Ian, Robert is
a fucking psychopath.

21:58.430 --> 22:01.633
He was shooting anything
that fucking moved in there.

22:01.633 --> 22:03.435
I was there.

22:04.036 --> 22:05.704
Jesus Christ.

22:05.704 --> 22:07.373
Robert did
what needed to be done.

22:07.373 --> 22:09.208
All you gotta do
is make this fucking call

22:09.208 --> 22:10.642
and you'll be
in Florida tomorrow morning,

22:10.642 --> 22:14.213
you, your family, fresh start.

22:16.415 --> 22:18.584
Just make the call.
I gotta get him back.

22:20.586 --> 22:22.054
The phone's right there.

22:35.033 --> 22:37.302
Jeff. Ben Morrisey.

22:38.070 --> 22:42.174
Um, so
I've just been thinking a lot,

22:42.174 --> 22:46.545
and, uh, I know
you need me to come in,

22:46.545 --> 22:48.013
and, uh...

22:50.682 --> 22:52.017
I can't do it.

22:56.288 --> 23:00.392
I can't, uh, I can't testify.

23:26.479 --> 23:27.814
Hey, Mike.

23:28.315 --> 23:30.383
You, uh,
you looking for somebody?

23:30.383 --> 23:31.785
No.

23:32.252 --> 23:35.622
Just, you know, whiskey.

23:36.823 --> 23:39.092
- All right.
- On the rocks.

23:40.126 --> 23:42.295
Gotta stay hyrdrated today.

23:50.704 --> 23:54.607
All right, man.
Well, it's good to have you.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.209
Yeah.

24:00.547 --> 24:01.715
Yeah.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.401
Fuck.

24:24.604 --> 24:25.772
Here.

24:25.772 --> 24:27.040
Thanks, man.

24:27.440 --> 24:30.276
Hey, Mike. Mike, Mike,
you can't take the glass.

24:38.451 --> 24:40.887
- <i>Hey. Hey.</i>
- Just keep moving.

24:41.554 --> 24:44.391
Hey! You know, the next
fucking innocent

24:44.391 --> 24:46.960
that Robert kills
is on your fucking head!

24:46.960 --> 24:48.528
Hope you can sleep with that.

24:48.528 --> 24:51.164
You're as bad as your fucking
rapist killer psycho guard dog

24:51.164 --> 24:53.066
- or whatever the fuck...
- Let's go, Charlie, let's go.

24:53.066 --> 24:54.067
Jesus Christ!

24:57.904 --> 24:59.172
Can't talk like that.

24:59.172 --> 25:01.074
Charlie, listen to me.
Get him in the house now.

25:01.074 --> 25:03.376
Charlie. Right now!

25:07.213 --> 25:10.283
Come on, that's it, that's it.
That's it, you got him.

25:29.202 --> 25:30.637
Fucking get his wallet.

25:30.637 --> 25:32.739
Charlie, just stay
where you are, all right?

25:32.739 --> 25:34.274
Don't move.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.545
Jesus Christ, Charlie.

25:39.813 --> 25:43.783
Come on. Come on, Charlie.
Out you go, out you go.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.190
Okay, Charlie, just kick that.
Kick that in for me.

25:50.757 --> 25:51.791
It's locked.

25:51.791 --> 25:52.992
Charlie, please kick it in.

25:52.992 --> 25:54.194
- You have the keys.
- I've got the keys.

25:54.194 --> 25:56.329
Kick the fucking door open now.

25:58.431 --> 26:01.101
Let's go. Good. All right.
Come on.

26:01.501 --> 26:03.403
- Take the hat off.
- Okay.

26:21.354 --> 26:23.389
Hey, I can fucking
take myself in.

26:23.389 --> 26:26.226
I was told to take you.
I'll take you.

26:38.204 --> 26:41.274
I've never seen anyone
earn more doing less.

26:42.442 --> 26:44.978
This work is beneath you, Iris.

26:45.545 --> 26:47.247
It's a waste of your talent.

26:47.514 --> 26:49.716
I don't see any talent.

26:50.617 --> 26:52.185
It works on you.

26:53.553 --> 26:55.555
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

26:55.889 --> 26:57.257
The truth.

26:57.257 --> 27:00.160
I'd like a moment
alone with her, please.

27:11.671 --> 27:13.473
You confound him.

27:15.475 --> 27:17.944
He beats you,
but you're not scared.

27:18.344 --> 27:20.346
You have no respect
for his power.

27:20.847 --> 27:23.449
I don't fear him 'cause he ain't
the one that beats me.

27:25.185 --> 27:26.553
You are.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.122
He just acts it out.

27:29.455 --> 27:31.157
Joseph has no power.

27:31.891 --> 27:33.826
I wish
you hadn't disappointed me.

27:34.227 --> 27:36.829
You deserve worthier challenges.

27:39.232 --> 27:41.367
You were happy
in New York, weren't you?

27:42.135 --> 27:43.336
It was a lie.

27:43.336 --> 27:44.938
Of course it was.

27:46.573 --> 27:50.043
That lie was as perfect
as love can be.

27:50.810 --> 27:54.180
A perfect illusion
to the one who receives it.

27:54.614 --> 27:56.382
And even more so
to the one who gives it

27:56.382 --> 28:01.287
because the giver receives
adoration and power, both.

28:01.955 --> 28:03.823
The lie never betrays you.

28:04.290 --> 28:05.858
Never leaves you,
never gets old,

28:05.858 --> 28:07.360
never gets cancer.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.363
It is perfect every time
you manufacture it.

28:12.899 --> 28:18.404
And what you have now
is a business transaction,

28:19.539 --> 28:22.275
an exchange of favors.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.444
What a waste.

28:44.530 --> 28:46.132
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am,
you're not on the list.</i>

28:46.132 --> 28:49.869
Oh, maybe look under Reed,
Jacob Reed.

28:51.037 --> 28:52.739
<i>He's not
in the system.</i>

28:52.739 --> 28:54.207
Well, he's gotta be
in the system...

28:54.207 --> 28:55.775
Can I help you, ma'am?

28:55.775 --> 28:57.443
<i>Ma'am, step
away from the window.</i>

28:57.443 --> 28:58.978
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- I have an appointment

28:58.978 --> 29:01.114
at 5:30 with Jacob Reed.

29:01.114 --> 29:02.849
I just confirmed it
this morning,

29:02.849 --> 29:05.184
so I don't understand
the confusion.

29:05.184 --> 29:06.519
I'm sorry for the confusion, miss,

29:06.519 --> 29:07.687
but the person you're here
to see

29:07.687 --> 29:09.289
is no longer in this section.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.391
No, he wasn't gonna be
transferred till tomorrow

29:11.391 --> 29:13.192
and that was the whole point
of the meeting tonight.

29:13.192 --> 29:14.494
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
I understand.

29:14.494 --> 29:16.062
What you can do is try to make
an appointment

29:16.062 --> 29:17.463
next week at the main house.

29:17.463 --> 29:18.865
It should take about
a day or two for processing

29:18.865 --> 29:20.933
before he's authorized
to have visitors.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.835
I am sorry, ma'am. Good day.

29:23.169 --> 29:24.671
Open up one.

30:00.707 --> 30:02.342
How's it going
over there?

30:02.342 --> 30:03.810
Shitty.

30:09.882 --> 30:11.284
How's Terry?

30:11.284 --> 30:12.585
Dead.

30:12.585 --> 30:14.187
Anybody sitting in this stool?

30:14.187 --> 30:17.690
I just told you
that Terry's dead,

30:17.690 --> 30:20.360
so who else is gonna take it?
But, sure, Mike,

30:21.961 --> 30:23.062
take a seat.

30:23.062 --> 30:25.732
It's a free damn country
for now.

30:29.202 --> 30:30.703
I'm sorry.

30:31.738 --> 30:32.939
For what?

30:33.873 --> 30:35.074
Terry.

30:35.074 --> 30:36.909
Don't be sorry for him.

30:39.245 --> 30:41.147
Be sorry for me.

30:43.583 --> 30:45.351
Fucking riots.

30:45.351 --> 30:47.353
Yeah, fucking riots.

30:48.187 --> 30:50.456
You jump in the cage,
you get what you get,

30:50.456 --> 30:51.691
I guess, right?

30:51.691 --> 30:54.994
It's like sometimes
you eat the bear,

30:55.428 --> 30:57.964
and sometimes the bear eats you.

31:00.299 --> 31:02.668
You still playing both sides?

31:02.668 --> 31:04.504
I'm not playing
either side.

31:04.504 --> 31:08.107
I just, uh, try to keep
all the sides

31:09.409 --> 31:11.677
at bay, quiet.

31:11.677 --> 31:13.479
How's that working out for you?

31:13.479 --> 31:17.183
I think I'm
pretty fucking terrible at it.

31:17.450 --> 31:19.152
To be honest with you.

31:26.592 --> 31:29.162
It hurts my head
when I drink it too fast.

31:30.496 --> 31:31.964
Me too.

31:33.366 --> 31:35.001
Are you mad at me?

31:35.334 --> 31:37.770
No. I'm not mad.

31:39.372 --> 31:41.674
You shouldn't be mean to people.

31:56.022 --> 31:59.125
You shouldn't talk
to people like that.

32:00.660 --> 32:03.229
No, buddy, you shouldn't
talk to people like that.

32:07.133 --> 32:09.769
Thank you
for my ice drink, Ian.

32:10.536 --> 32:12.772
It's not hurting my head.

32:14.373 --> 32:16.742
And thank you
for the French air.

32:30.723 --> 32:33.359
Come on, buddy.
Let me take you back.

32:33.359 --> 32:35.261
Come on. Let's get you back.

32:35.261 --> 32:36.796
Okay.

32:55.275 --> 32:58.445
Fuck them all.
Fuck them all. Fuck them all!

32:58.445 --> 33:00.848
Get up, buddy. Come on.

33:00.848 --> 33:03.484
We can't play with you
down there in all this shit.

33:03.484 --> 33:04.685
I don't like waiting too long.

33:04.685 --> 33:07.654
I'm right there with you,
Big Shooter.

33:08.689 --> 33:10.057
Let's sit you right here.

33:10.057 --> 33:12.593
Calls up outta nowhere
and says, "We're good."

33:12.593 --> 33:13.894
What the fuck does that mean?

33:13.894 --> 33:16.030
It means the investigation's
over, I think.

33:16.030 --> 33:17.631
I mean, no fucking
Morrisey talking,

33:17.631 --> 33:18.999
there's no fucking case.

33:18.999 --> 33:20.834
Maybe Mike got through
to him, I don't know.

33:20.834 --> 33:22.069
Yeah, maybe, I don't know.

33:22.069 --> 33:24.271
I tried him,
but no fucking answer.

33:24.271 --> 33:26.073
Hey. Where the fuck is Ian?

33:26.073 --> 33:28.709
He's coming. He had to do
some inmate escort shit.

33:30.844 --> 33:34.848
Oh, shit. The door opens.

33:35.749 --> 33:37.418
Stevie, you know the rule.

33:37.418 --> 33:38.719
If you don't play a sport,
be one.

33:38.719 --> 33:40.621
Go get me
a fucking beer, would you?

33:42.189 --> 33:44.892
It's like a fucking weight
being lifted.

33:45.526 --> 33:46.927
Was about to call
fucking Morrisey

33:46.927 --> 33:48.128
just to fucking thank the guy.

33:48.128 --> 33:50.030
Don't fucking do that.
Mike said not to

33:50.030 --> 33:51.932
and it worked out,
so just leave it.

33:51.932 --> 33:53.634
Yeah. I didn't fucking call him.

33:54.601 --> 33:56.136
Well, I'm happy for you.

33:56.403 --> 33:58.272
- Thank you, bruh.
- Yeah.

34:00.941 --> 34:02.843
- Oh, shit, I gotta take this.
- Is it Mike?

34:02.843 --> 34:04.711
Hey, don't touch the table,
all right?

34:04.711 --> 34:05.979
I know where
all the balls are laying.

34:05.979 --> 34:07.714
I've got it right in my head.

34:10.784 --> 34:11.919
Can you hear me?

34:11.919 --> 34:13.654
- <i>I called around.</i>
- Yeah.

34:13.654 --> 34:15.322
<i>Ain't nothing out there
on the mayor.</i>

34:16.590 --> 34:18.692
- Nothing?
- <i>All quiet.</i>

34:18.692 --> 34:20.994
No, that's good. Yeah, fuck.

34:21.295 --> 34:23.564
Um, I appreciate that.

34:23.564 --> 34:24.865
<i>Sure, man.</i>

34:24.865 --> 34:27.601
- Hey. Bunny.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

34:27.601 --> 34:30.003
You know, if he calls you,
you let me know, okay?

34:30.003 --> 34:31.572
<i>I got you, baby bro.</i>

34:31.572 --> 34:32.873
All right, thanks.

34:34.341 --> 34:35.342
Watch my man.

34:35.342 --> 34:36.743
The fuck am I looking at here?

34:39.113 --> 34:41.782
You'd be surprised at how many
times that shit works.

34:41.782 --> 34:44.051
I'd be surprised
if that shit worked once.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.221
That was Bunny.

34:47.221 --> 34:49.823
His guy on the inside said there
was no target on Mike, so...

34:49.823 --> 34:51.692
Then where the fuck is he?

34:53.660 --> 34:55.262
I don't fucking know.

34:55.729 --> 34:57.064
We should go
to a hospital.

34:57.064 --> 34:59.066
More people die
from cars than guns.

34:59.066 --> 35:02.102
Shit, more people die
from entering the hospital

35:02.102 --> 35:04.905
than the diseases
that they entered there for.

35:06.940 --> 35:09.376
What the fuck, Stevie?

35:10.711 --> 35:11.845
What's up?

35:11.845 --> 35:14.348
There he fucking is.

35:14.348 --> 35:15.816
About fucking time.

35:16.283 --> 35:18.519
- Fucking paperwork.
- Jesus Christ.

35:18.519 --> 35:20.320
Hey, what were you doing?

35:21.355 --> 35:26.627
I had to take a fucking
serial killer to the dentist.

35:26.627 --> 35:28.362
- Is that a euphemism?
- No.

35:28.362 --> 35:30.430
Hey, Robert's cleared.

35:36.937 --> 35:38.238
- Fuckin' A. Fuckin' A.
- Fuckin' A.

35:38.238 --> 35:41.208
Line them up, Lew.
Shots, beers. Go.

35:45.412 --> 35:47.247
Fuck, just leave the bottle.

35:49.416 --> 35:50.717
Come on, Lew.

35:50.717 --> 35:52.252
To the fucking good guys!

35:52.252 --> 35:54.721
- The good guys.
- Fucking good guys.

35:57.558 --> 35:58.859
Thanks, Mike.

35:59.459 --> 36:02.596
I didn't know I needed that
as much as I needed that.

36:04.498 --> 36:06.266
Yeah, well, glad to help.

36:07.367 --> 36:08.602
Fuck you.

36:08.602 --> 36:10.304
Yeah. I just did.

36:16.610 --> 36:17.978
Do you want some?

36:19.680 --> 36:21.215
No.

36:24.618 --> 36:26.420
I'm tapping out here.

36:51.245 --> 36:53.981
Terry was such a big guy,
you know?

36:54.915 --> 36:57.184
Made me feel small,

36:57.184 --> 37:00.587
delicate, like I was
this little thing

37:00.587 --> 37:03.190
that needed to be taken care of.

37:03.991 --> 37:06.893
And he was the only one
who could take care of me.

37:12.966 --> 37:17.070
And them coloreds just... Fuck.

37:18.839 --> 37:20.907
Fuck, Mike.

37:28.081 --> 37:31.385
I heard it was like a...

37:32.419 --> 37:35.255
I heard it was
a nightmare in there.

37:37.591 --> 37:39.159
Uh, yeah.

37:41.628 --> 37:43.063
It was.

37:43.664 --> 37:45.032
I wasn't in the building,

37:45.032 --> 37:49.369
but I was outside and...

37:53.273 --> 37:54.508
It was.

37:55.342 --> 37:57.377
Did you see Terry?

37:59.446 --> 38:01.848
No. No, I didn't.

38:03.417 --> 38:07.321
I don't know if I can
make it out here without him.

38:08.522 --> 38:11.258
I'm just so fucking angry.

38:12.893 --> 38:15.896
At all of them,
every single person in there.

38:15.896 --> 38:17.464
And at Terry.

38:18.799 --> 38:22.636
It's like you have
someone waiting for you,

38:22.636 --> 38:24.004
waiting here,

38:24.004 --> 38:26.506
so why the fuck
you gotta go down there,

38:26.506 --> 38:27.908
be a hero or whatever

38:27.908 --> 38:30.877
for a bunch of fucking lowlifes?

38:35.215 --> 38:38.251
He was just doing his job,
you know, so...

38:40.287 --> 38:43.256
Nothing more. Nothing less.

39:18.225 --> 39:21.027
Yeah. Yeah, he's still here.

39:22.229 --> 39:23.363
Yeah.

39:25.098 --> 39:27.167
Oh, shit, he's up. I gotta go.

39:27.501 --> 39:29.035
Okay.

39:30.537 --> 39:31.605
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:31.605 --> 39:33.573
You want some coffee?

39:33.573 --> 39:35.942
No, no, I gotta get going.

39:35.942 --> 39:37.411
<i></i> Oh, yeah, sure.

39:37.411 --> 39:39.646
But a cup of coffee
couldn't hurt, though.

39:39.646 --> 39:42.582
No, I got, I gotta get back
to doing what I do.

39:42.582 --> 39:44.618
- Whatever that is.
- Right.

39:44.618 --> 39:46.686
A person is what they do.

39:46.686 --> 39:48.188
Yeah.

39:49.790 --> 39:51.258
All right.

39:52.092 --> 39:54.094
Thanks for coming by.

39:54.094 --> 39:56.296
Thanks for having me, Allison.

39:57.931 --> 40:00.233
- Hey, Mike?
- Yeah.

40:04.971 --> 40:06.506
You take care of yourself.

40:07.874 --> 40:10.343
Yeah. You too.

41:17.439 --> 41:18.640
Anything?

41:19.308 --> 41:20.409
No.

41:21.477 --> 41:24.313
What if something
really fucking happened?

41:25.347 --> 41:26.515
I...

41:32.554 --> 41:33.789
He here?

41:34.356 --> 41:35.524
No.

41:45.601 --> 41:46.735
Where's the mayor?

41:46.735 --> 41:48.670
Bunny told me to find him
and bring him to him.

41:48.670 --> 41:49.938
Don't know.

41:49.938 --> 41:51.106
Don't know?

41:51.106 --> 41:52.374
Is there an echo in here?

41:52.374 --> 41:53.809
Fuck you. I need to know
where he's at.

41:53.809 --> 41:58.414
Hey, if they... we said
we don't know here is,

41:58.414 --> 41:59.748
we don't know where he is.

42:01.550 --> 42:02.751
Don't shush me.

42:03.585 --> 42:05.320
Back up.

42:23.238 --> 42:24.773
It's your mom.

42:29.178 --> 42:31.313
- Yeah, Ma.
- <i>Michael?</i>

42:31.313 --> 42:33.282
- No, it's Kyle.
- <i>Kyle.</i>

42:33.282 --> 42:34.683
I'm at the office.

42:34.683 --> 42:36.285
<i>Why do you
have Michael's phone?</i>

42:36.285 --> 42:37.753
It was in his desk.

42:37.753 --> 42:39.955
Oh, God. Where is he?

42:39.955 --> 42:41.423
<i>I don't know.</i>

42:41.790 --> 42:43.358
<i>Is he all right?</i>

42:44.059 --> 42:46.695
You know as much as I do, Ma.

43:07.816 --> 43:08.984
Jesus.

43:09.384 --> 43:11.086
It's me from yesterday.

43:11.086 --> 43:12.621
I know.

43:12.921 --> 43:14.490
I need that gun now.

43:26.935 --> 43:28.737
I need my keys too, all right?

43:34.543 --> 43:38.413
Um, yeah. The keys I can't.

43:38.413 --> 43:39.715
What do you mean you can't?

43:39.715 --> 43:41.283
You told me you'd come asking.
I wasn't supposed

43:41.283 --> 43:42.751
to give them to you.

43:43.285 --> 43:45.320
Oh, no, fuck.
That was yesterday.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.523
I was drink...
I'm stone sober now.

43:47.890 --> 43:49.158
You said.

43:49.591 --> 43:51.160
Yeah, I know what I said, okay?

43:51.160 --> 43:53.328
Just... Fuck, fuck!

43:54.229 --> 43:55.931
Sorry, you're right.

43:55.931 --> 43:57.432
Just lock your doors, would you?

43:57.432 --> 43:59.001
- What?
- Lock your doors.

43:59.001 --> 44:00.869
Lock this door
behind me as well.
