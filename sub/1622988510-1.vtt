WEBVTT

01:34.163 --> 01:34.996
- Oh.

01:57.141 --> 01:57.974
Phew.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.980
Are you Adam?

03:54.980 --> 03:55.813
- I am.

03:55.813 --> 03:56.830
- Hi, Sydney.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.290
Nice to meet.
- You too.

03:58.290 --> 03:59.440
You too, please, have a seat.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.273
- Thank you.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.750
- Thank you so much for meeting me.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.390
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

04:04.390 --> 04:06.490
I have heard great things about you.

04:06.490 --> 04:07.880
- They are all lies.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.053
- Well, I assumed.

04:10.490 --> 04:13.360
- So did you get a chance
to read the script?

04:13.360 --> 04:15.317
- To read "Macbeth"?

04:16.550 --> 04:18.580
- Yeah, but I was just joking.

04:18.580 --> 04:19.913
- Oh, right.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.960
- So I guess I'll tell you a little bit

04:24.960 --> 04:28.240
about the concept for this
production, which is hard to do

04:28.240 --> 04:31.133
because I don't have a
concept for this production.

04:32.140 --> 04:35.000
It seems to me that when
people direct Shakespeare,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.380
they get so intimidated by
the 400 years of history

04:39.380 --> 04:43.380
and legend that they cling to
an idea of what the play is

04:43.380 --> 04:45.150
or what they could make it.

04:45.150 --> 04:46.810
You know, my "Macbeth".

04:46.810 --> 04:50.580
My "Macbeth" is about sexual frustration.

04:50.580 --> 04:54.220
My "Macbeth" is about
prohibition era Chicago

04:54.220 --> 04:57.710
My "Macbeth" is about dancing monkeys.

04:57.710 --> 05:00.420
You know, anything to
avoid the paralyzing terror

05:00.420 --> 05:02.450
of directing the actual play.

05:02.450 --> 05:05.830
- So you're aiming for a
more faithful production?

05:05.830 --> 05:07.973
- No, not faithful, um.

05:09.400 --> 05:12.910
I mean, yes, faithful, but
not to the play's history,

05:12.910 --> 05:14.590
not to the play's period,

05:14.590 --> 05:19.480
to the play, you know, the play.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.370
- Yeah, I think I get you.

05:21.370 --> 05:23.590
- And I mean, look, I know
that we all say this, right,

05:23.590 --> 05:26.340
but it's about the text,
that we're serving the text.

05:26.340 --> 05:28.910
We all say that, but it's lip service.

05:28.910 --> 05:30.730
99% of Shakespeare productions

05:30.730 --> 05:32.560
are about the director's clever ideas.

05:32.560 --> 05:35.800
But the thing is that no one
gives a shit about your ideas.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.620
Directing is not an intellectual pursuit.

05:37.620 --> 05:38.960
It's a craft, you know,

05:38.960 --> 05:41.300
get the play up on its
feet, get it running.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.133
Let it,

05:43.951 --> 05:44.784
let it play.

05:49.002 --> 05:50.457
Am I making any sense?

05:51.444 --> 05:53.863
- Yes, you are.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.553
- I'm sorry.

05:55.553 --> 05:59.283
I, I just launched into this
whole soliloquy, I guess,

06:00.770 --> 06:01.710
what I'm trying to say.
- Adam, do you mind

06:01.710 --> 06:03.110
if I make this easy for you?

06:04.948 --> 06:06.723
- No, I don't.

06:07.590 --> 06:08.783
- I need to work.

06:09.670 --> 06:10.930
I need a break from the city.

06:10.930 --> 06:13.700
I don't want to do another stupid movie.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.327
Massachusetts is lovely.

06:15.327 --> 06:17.370
"Macbeth" is "Macbeth".

06:17.370 --> 06:20.230
So I didn't come here to be convinced.

06:20.230 --> 06:23.613
I came here to see if you
were actively unbearable.

06:26.223 --> 06:30.220
- And am I?

06:30.220 --> 06:31.213
- Not so far.

06:32.070 --> 06:33.710
- So you're saying?

06:33.710 --> 06:35.650
- I'm saying yes.

06:35.650 --> 06:36.920
- Like yes, yes?

06:36.920 --> 06:39.233
- I don't know what that means, but yes.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.333
- That's great.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.533
That is extremely great.

06:44.460 --> 06:47.456
I love your work, it'll
be an honor to direct you.

06:47.456 --> 06:49.751
- No, no, no, no, you cannot pull that.

06:49.751 --> 06:50.658
- What?

06:50.658 --> 06:52.647
- It's an honor to work with you.

06:52.647 --> 06:54.197
You don't get to be starstruck.

06:55.056 --> 06:56.423
You have to direct.

06:58.150 --> 06:59.300
- Okay.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.133
Okay.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.160
- I'm really glad that you're doing this.

07:07.160 --> 07:07.993
- Yeah.

07:09.110 --> 07:09.943
Yeah, me too.

07:42.637 --> 07:45.700
- Breakfast is normally 7:30.

07:45.700 --> 07:49.880
We can do later, but try and
let us know the evening before.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.123
- 7:30 is good.

07:52.330 --> 07:55.333
- You stayed with us before, haven't you?

07:55.333 --> 07:56.683
A long time ago.

07:58.190 --> 07:59.580
- Well.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.693
Welcome back.

08:01.620 --> 08:02.453
- Thanks.

08:05.770 --> 08:06.940
- This work for you?

08:08.250 --> 08:09.083
- It's perfect.

08:10.220 --> 08:12.100
- Then I'll let you settle in.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.944
You just shout if you need anything.

08:13.944 --> 08:17.400
I don't hear too good
these days, so shout loud.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.293
- I can handle that.
- Good girl.

08:21.476 --> 08:22.643
Oh.

08:27.690 --> 08:28.523
Sydney!

08:29.591 --> 08:30.424
- Oh.

08:31.756 --> 08:32.589
- Ah!

08:34.042 --> 08:34.875
- Hi!
- Oh.

08:35.860 --> 08:38.170
- I heard you were coming,
but I didn't believe it.

08:38.170 --> 08:40.371
Sydney Levison in the flesh.

08:40.371 --> 08:42.050
What brings you back to the provinces?

08:42.050 --> 08:44.800
Did Hollywood chew you
up and spit you out?

08:44.800 --> 08:45.920
- Eh, more or less.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.500
- Good, ah, no, no, no!

08:47.500 --> 08:50.490
Good, so much the better for the theater.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.120
Oh, let me have a look at you.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.708
God, you look delicious.

08:53.708 --> 08:54.560
- Oh!

08:54.560 --> 08:56.520
- What's new, something's new.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.080
New lover, new haircut, facelift?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.770
- Nothing's new, Hugh.

09:00.770 --> 09:03.540
- That I don't for a moment believe.

09:03.540 --> 09:06.050
Oh listen, I was just
about to go into town

09:06.050 --> 09:08.748
because the bar here is
hopelessly understocked,

09:08.748 --> 09:09.581
is there anything you need?

09:09.581 --> 09:11.520
- No, no, I'm fine.

09:11.520 --> 09:12.410
- Well, I'll be back

09:12.410 --> 09:15.990
and we are not on call
until tomorrow morning.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.960
So I expect to be drinking with you

09:17.960 --> 09:19.590
until the wee hours, all right.

09:19.590 --> 09:21.630
- Mm-hm, we'll see.

09:21.630 --> 09:22.863
- Well, it's good enough.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.490
Oh God, it's good to see you.

09:27.490 --> 09:29.510
- It's great to see you too, Hugh.

09:29.510 --> 09:31.000
- Oh, all right.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.100
I'll be back.
- Okay.

09:37.132 --> 09:37.965
Oh.

10:03.182 --> 10:06.260
Well, you made yourself right at home.

10:06.260 --> 10:07.553
- Sydney, you made it.

10:08.550 --> 10:10.020
- No, no, no, no, don't get up.

10:10.020 --> 10:12.499
You're too picturesque.

10:12.499 --> 10:14.660
- Well, then sit down please.

10:14.660 --> 10:15.493
- Thanks.

10:16.907 --> 10:18.070
- Did you find the place okay?

10:18.070 --> 10:19.260
- Yes.

10:19.260 --> 10:20.340
Yes, I did.

10:20.340 --> 10:22.263
- You must've stayed here before.

10:22.263 --> 10:24.490
- Troilus and Cressida.

10:24.490 --> 10:29.040
I was 23 and the place
has changed not at all.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.630
- It must be kind of comforting.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.003
- Uh, yes and no.

10:33.020 --> 10:35.180
It reminds me of how much I've changed.

10:35.180 --> 10:36.540
- Like how?

10:36.540 --> 10:39.260
- I was 23.

10:39.260 --> 10:42.663
I was in love with
theater, in love with life,

10:43.520 --> 10:45.153
and I was also in love.

10:46.570 --> 10:47.403
- And now?

10:50.360 --> 10:52.065
- Oh, you're very good at that.

10:52.065 --> 10:53.284
What?

10:53.284 --> 10:57.760
- The innocuous question
that leads to the revelation.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.770
You might be a good director.

10:59.770 --> 11:00.960
- Oh, thanks.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.516
I'm trying to be.

11:02.516 --> 11:03.780
- Is this your first time here?

11:03.780 --> 11:05.490
- First time working.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.257
Yeah, I used to come up here

11:07.257 --> 11:08.913
and see things whenever I could.

11:09.801 --> 11:11.700
It's kind of a trek from the city though.

11:11.700 --> 11:12.533
That's why I like it.

11:12.533 --> 11:13.366
- Yeah, me too.

11:16.610 --> 11:19.810
- Well, don't mind me.

11:19.810 --> 11:24.810
I'm just going to sit here and read.

11:28.837 --> 11:32.020
- "Agricultural Practice
in Early New England".

11:32.020 --> 11:33.350
Huh.

11:33.350 --> 11:35.710
- Look, I don't judge your hobbies.

11:35.710 --> 11:36.950
- You're right.

11:36.950 --> 11:37.783
Sorry.

12:08.610 --> 12:10.205
You wanna go for a walk?

12:10.205 --> 12:11.555
- I thought you'd never ask

12:14.610 --> 12:17.550
- You think he ever dreamed
that 400 years later

12:17.550 --> 12:19.780
we'd still be hanging his name on banners?

12:19.780 --> 12:20.613
- Probably not.

12:22.989 --> 12:26.930
- You know, Emerson said that
aliens, if there are aliens,

12:26.930 --> 12:29.640
would probably call
this planet Shakespeare.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.320
- Emerson wrote about aliens?

12:31.320 --> 12:32.523
- Apparently so, yeah.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.070
Read about it on Wikipedia.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.120
- If there are aliens,

12:38.120 --> 12:40.270
they'd probably call
this planet Wikipedia.

12:41.117 --> 12:42.017
- That maybe true.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.240
- Hey, you know what's cool?

12:47.240 --> 12:48.283
- No, what's cool?

12:50.240 --> 12:51.650
- Plymouth, Massachusetts.

12:51.650 --> 12:54.240
It's the first English
colony in the Northeast.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.223
It's only like 20 miles away from here.

12:57.093 --> 13:00.560
It was founded just a few
years after Shakespeare died.

13:00.560 --> 13:04.030
And Jamestown was established in 1607,

13:04.030 --> 13:07.450
which is right about the same
time "Macbeth" was written.

13:07.450 --> 13:09.720
And his last play "The Tempest"

13:09.720 --> 13:11.693
is all about discovering a new world.

13:13.150 --> 13:14.350
And there's almost like,

13:15.390 --> 13:17.110
in the great sweep of Western history,

13:17.110 --> 13:22.000
this like passing on the baton
from Shakespeare to America.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.963
Like, all right, well,
we'll take it from here.

13:26.420 --> 13:28.750
- What are you some kind of optimist?

13:28.750 --> 13:30.760
- In certain moods.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.250
- Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.633
- Thank God for that.

14:16.050 --> 14:19.150
- Welcome, everyone to the
first day of rehearsal.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.540
My name is Adam and I will
be your least favorite person

14:21.540 --> 14:22.999
for the next three weeks.

14:25.270 --> 14:27.620
Um, there's something I'd like to address

14:27.620 --> 14:29.340
before we get started.

14:29.340 --> 14:33.543
Let's just get it out of the
way and move on, shall we.

14:34.770 --> 14:35.823
The curse.

14:37.650 --> 14:40.750
Now look, everyone is
entitled to their own opinion

14:40.750 --> 14:44.140
about whether or not magic exists,

14:44.140 --> 14:46.130
but I am here to tell you this.

14:46.130 --> 14:49.160
I have dug deep into the allegations

14:49.160 --> 14:50.750
of a curse on the play "Macbeth".

14:50.750 --> 14:53.160
I have done more research on the question

14:53.160 --> 14:56.390
than anyone should ever dream of doing.

14:56.390 --> 15:01.390
I have spoken to historians,
scholars, experts on the occult

15:02.050 --> 15:07.050
and I can say with great
authority, there is no curse.

15:09.430 --> 15:12.340
There is no history of troubled
productions of this play.

15:12.340 --> 15:14.680
Any more than any other
play that's been performed

15:14.680 --> 15:18.370
for 400 years, the witch's
scene does not contain

15:18.370 --> 15:20.310
the text of a real spell.

15:20.310 --> 15:24.830
The play's not hexed by
witches' some sort of revenge.

15:24.830 --> 15:29.020
And we all know the rumors,
we've heard the superstitions.

15:29.020 --> 15:30.580
We can't even say the word "Macbeth".

15:30.580 --> 15:35.510
We have to say The Scottish
play, Mackers, et cetera.

15:35.510 --> 15:39.340
And some of us have even
experienced some creepy accidents

15:39.340 --> 15:41.410
while working on this play.

15:41.410 --> 15:42.860
But that is just a coincidence.

15:42.860 --> 15:45.930
It is not the effect of black magic.

15:45.930 --> 15:47.910
And the only thing that we
really need to be afraid

15:47.910 --> 15:52.090
of is putting on a mediocre show.

15:52.090 --> 15:52.923
- Hear, hear!

15:53.950 --> 15:55.040
- Thank you, Hugh.

15:55.040 --> 15:55.873
All right.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.570
Should we give this sucker a read?

15:59.570 --> 16:01.200
- Quick question, Adam?

16:01.200 --> 16:03.170
- Yes, Hugh?

16:03.170 --> 16:04.073
- What's that?

16:10.180 --> 16:13.750
- All right, whoever
you are, it's not funny!

16:13.750 --> 16:15.600
Please get out or I'll call security.

16:18.930 --> 16:23.280
Don't
put on a mediocre show.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.083
- We won't.

16:27.930 --> 16:29.713
Okay, we won't, thank you.

16:40.210 --> 16:41.970
- You heard the man.

16:41.970 --> 16:42.803
Let's get started.

16:42.803 --> 16:44.530
Act one, scene one.

16:44.530 --> 16:45.940
Lauren, please.

16:45.940 --> 16:50.353
- Okay, thunder and lightning
enter three witches.

16:55.600 --> 17:00.600
- Ladies and gentlemen to the
Bard of Stratford-upon-Avon.

17:01.790 --> 17:02.623
Cheers!

17:04.927 --> 17:07.377
- And now, I think we'd
all like to hear a speech

17:08.380 --> 17:09.983
from our fearless leader.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.010
Adam, the floor is yours.

17:12.010 --> 17:13.820
- Oh God, do I have to?

17:13.820 --> 17:15.392
- You have to.

17:15.392 --> 17:16.716
- Adam.
- Come on, Adam.

17:16.716 --> 17:19.549
- Let's go.
- All right, all right.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.573
I'm not much of a speech maker.

17:24.690 --> 17:27.390
I'd rather let the Bard speak
for me most of the time.

17:37.035 --> 17:41.085
I do want to say that I am
very grateful to be here.

17:41.085 --> 17:42.950
I'm very grateful for this place,

17:42.950 --> 17:47.283
this play and this wonderful company.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.680
How many goodly creatures are there here?

17:52.680 --> 17:54.740
How beauteous mankind is,

17:54.740 --> 17:57.623
a brave new world that
has such people in it.

18:00.094 --> 18:01.134
Cheers.

18:01.134 --> 18:02.384
Cheers!

18:05.640 --> 18:06.473
- Not bad.

18:07.470 --> 18:09.460
Oh, fearless leader, not bad at all.

18:09.460 --> 18:11.070
Thank you, Hugh.

18:11.070 --> 18:12.073
- Don't mention it.

18:23.320 --> 18:26.860
- So how are you liking the
Hugh Painter experience?

18:26.860 --> 18:27.810
- I'm surviving it.

18:29.100 --> 18:31.060
- He didn't like that you passed his test.

18:31.060 --> 18:32.520
- What the speech?

18:32.520 --> 18:33.940
- He was trying to embarrass you.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.270
- He succeeded.

18:35.270 --> 18:37.698
- Yeah, but not in the way he wanted to.

18:37.698 --> 18:38.598
You came off well.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.500
Jess liked it.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.333
- She's sweet.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.433
- Uh, are these things working?

18:48.050 --> 18:50.030
Did you just come out of a bad breakup?

18:50.030 --> 18:51.203
Celibate, gay?

18:52.249 --> 18:54.257
- I don't think so, why?

18:54.257 --> 18:58.340
- Because Jess is sweet, but
she's also freaking gorgeous.

18:58.340 --> 19:00.380
- I didn't say she wasn't.

19:00.380 --> 19:01.440
- Oh, are you married?

19:01.440 --> 19:03.197
- I think that question is
way beyond the boundaries.

19:03.197 --> 19:05.190
- Are you married?

19:05.190 --> 19:06.720
- No, I'm not married.

19:06.720 --> 19:07.850
I'm not in a relationship.

19:07.850 --> 19:09.070
I'm not gay.

19:09.070 --> 19:13.923
And Jess is gorgeous,
but I'm here to work.

19:15.710 --> 19:17.110
And I think it's kind of sketchy

19:17.110 --> 19:19.060
when directors hit on their actresses.

19:19.060 --> 19:20.077
- But if she hit on you?

19:20.077 --> 19:21.460
- You think she will?

19:21.460 --> 19:22.340
- So you'd be open to it?

19:22.340 --> 19:24.040
- I didn't say--
- But would you?

19:25.463 --> 19:26.593
- You trying to set me up?

19:26.593 --> 19:29.120
- Yeah, why not?

19:29.120 --> 19:30.557
I had a legendary romance up here.

19:30.557 --> 19:32.600
Why not you?
- Why not you?

19:32.600 --> 19:35.982
- Oh, no, no, I'm too old for showmance.

19:35.982 --> 19:37.081
You are not too old.

19:37.081 --> 19:38.460
- Yes, I'm very old.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.280
- What are you, 35?

19:40.280 --> 19:41.294
- Charmer.

19:41.294 --> 19:43.297
- 29?
- Idiot.

19:43.297 --> 19:44.570
- A 112?
- Jackass.

19:44.570 --> 19:46.420
- You're just mad I guessed it right.

19:48.708 --> 19:50.470
- Oh, you guys need drinks.

19:50.470 --> 19:51.731
What are you having?

19:51.731 --> 19:53.810
- A beer would be great.

19:53.810 --> 19:54.880
- Beer and a shot, you got it.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.210
Sydney?

19:56.210 --> 19:57.750
- I'll take a scotch.

19:57.750 --> 19:58.903
- Good for you.

20:02.370 --> 20:03.600
- I'll have a scotch.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.000
- Seems appropriate.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.150
- I like the way you drink.

20:06.150 --> 20:07.470
- Thank you, kindly.

20:07.470 --> 20:11.010
- Hey, no private parties, you guys.

20:11.010 --> 20:11.843
Scoot over.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.630
What are we talking about?

20:15.630 --> 20:16.730
- Oh, just gossip.

20:16.730 --> 20:18.583
- Huh, no, that's boring.

20:20.480 --> 20:21.720
Let's do a monologue off.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.090
- Oof.
- I'll do a monologue.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.400
You do a monologue.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.400
And Adam will declare the winner.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.430
- What are the criteria?

20:29.430 --> 20:33.068
- Just fucking winning.

20:33.068 --> 20:34.401
- Oh, you're on.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.910
- Oh freedom!

20:38.910 --> 20:40.353
Sweet, sweet freedom!

20:41.703 --> 20:43.023
- I feel bad leaving Jess in there.

20:43.023 --> 20:45.524
She was only halfway through
the Queen Mab speech.

20:45.524 --> 20:47.140
- Oh no, she'll be fine, she's loving it.

20:47.140 --> 20:48.890
He's still a big star to her.

20:48.890 --> 20:51.040
- He's a big star to a lot of people.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.270
- Yeah, I prefer the Brits.

20:53.270 --> 20:55.080
- Any Brits in particular?

20:55.080 --> 20:56.663
- Nope, just all of 'em.

20:58.730 --> 21:01.930
Hey, hey, you shouldn't
have made that speech

21:01.930 --> 21:02.963
about the curse.

21:04.050 --> 21:04.933
- Don't tell me you believe it.

21:04.933 --> 21:08.200
- No, no, I don't, but now
if anyone stubs their toe

21:08.200 --> 21:10.410
or catches a cold, they'll blame you.

21:10.410 --> 21:13.020
You tempted the God's,
people don't like that.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.220
I think I'll take my chances.

21:15.220 --> 21:17.750
- I admire your foolish courage.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.057
Thank you.

21:19.057 --> 21:20.140
- No problem.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.923
I'm gonna climb this tree now.

21:24.558 --> 21:25.528
- You think that's wise?

21:25.528 --> 21:26.757
- No, I don't think it is.

21:26.757 --> 21:28.720
That's why I have to do it.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.470
- Okay, just be careful, all right.

21:31.470 --> 21:33.680
Your understudy's like 12.

21:33.680 --> 21:34.980
I'm doing great.

21:38.450 --> 21:40.923
- You think there are
any cops in this town?

21:43.160 --> 21:44.680
- Doubt it.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.220
- Any authority figures of any kind?

21:47.220 --> 21:48.370
- I guess it's just me.

22:02.494 --> 22:04.080
- Jesus Christ.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.030
I'm okay.

22:05.878 --> 22:06.711
I'm okay.

22:06.711 --> 22:09.150
- Okay, you got to come down seriously.

22:09.150 --> 22:10.550
It's not funny anymore.

22:10.550 --> 22:12.150
Okay, I'm coming down.

22:16.490 --> 22:17.978
- He's climbing higher.

22:17.978 --> 22:20.200
- Yeah, I think so.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.370
- All right, we're going to bed.

22:22.370 --> 22:24.250
Goodnight, have fun with your tree.

22:24.250 --> 22:26.653
Okay, goodnight,
I love you guys.

22:27.650 --> 22:29.070
- You think he's okay?

22:29.070 --> 22:30.480
- Oh, he's fine.

22:30.480 --> 22:31.410
He's not that drunk.

22:31.410 --> 22:33.800
It's mostly just high spirits.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.050
- So we're not bad people if we leave?

22:36.050 --> 22:36.883
- Come on.

22:41.330 --> 22:43.210
- Hey, you know what occurred to me?

22:43.210 --> 22:44.043
- I don't.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.160
- I didn't ask if you were married.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.710
- Oh, I don't know if you should.

22:48.710 --> 22:50.793
That might not be appropriate.

22:52.908 --> 22:54.107
- I feel like you're not.

22:54.107 --> 22:56.730
I feel like I would have heard about it.

22:56.730 --> 22:58.860
- You read a lot of People Magazine?

22:58.860 --> 23:00.323
- Well, yeah, in airports.

23:02.040 --> 23:02.973
- I'm not married.

23:04.930 --> 23:06.850
- Were you ever married?

23:06.850 --> 23:07.683
- Never.

23:08.709 --> 23:11.170
At this point, I assume I won't be.

23:11.170 --> 23:12.003
- Why is that?

23:13.120 --> 23:14.783
- Oh, it's a young person's game.

23:15.860 --> 23:18.050
Most of my friends are already divorced.

23:18.050 --> 23:20.665
I don't think that
puts them ahead of you.

23:20.665 --> 23:22.030
It depends
on how you look at it.

23:22.030 --> 23:24.090
Well, how do you look at it?

23:24.090 --> 23:25.423
Depends on the day.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.410
- How old are you anyway?

23:30.280 --> 23:31.730
- Now, that would be telling.

23:35.130 --> 23:38.120
Hey, I know this is
none of my business, but--

23:38.120 --> 23:39.773
- Oh, I love where this is going.

23:41.712 --> 23:42.862
Are you happy?

23:45.690 --> 23:47.040
- Uh.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.550
I'm not unhappy.

23:49.550 --> 23:52.670
- Yeah, but what are you looking for?

23:52.670 --> 23:53.520
What do you want?

23:55.230 --> 23:56.923
- If I knew that Adam,

23:58.230 --> 23:59.443
if I knew that.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.060
- I'm gonna go check on Lucas.

24:11.060 --> 24:11.893
I feel bad.

24:13.070 --> 24:14.110
- He's fine, Adam.

24:14.110 --> 24:16.663
- I know, I'm just gonna check on him.

24:19.140 --> 24:19.973
- All right.

24:20.810 --> 24:23.930
Well, get some rest.

24:23.930 --> 24:24.763
- You too.

24:25.817 --> 24:27.243
It's a big day tomorrow.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.747
- They're all big days.

24:30.747 --> 24:32.164
Exactly.

26:20.730 --> 26:22.529
- Are you all right?

26:22.529 --> 26:25.403
- I, I am well.

26:26.370 --> 26:29.723
Yet stranger time than
strange is this I see.

26:30.610 --> 26:34.510
More curious lands and less
familiar people than ever

26:34.510 --> 26:36.593
I did think to look upon.

26:38.590 --> 26:41.500
- You're not from around here then?

26:41.500 --> 26:43.203
- In faith, I know not where I am.

26:45.609 --> 26:47.710
Nor cannot tell being ignorant of that

26:47.710 --> 26:52.710
how far, how close my
birth land maybe found.

26:54.430 --> 26:57.430
If I must judge the
thing by raw appearance,

26:57.430 --> 27:02.343
I am as distant from my
home as fish from heaven,

27:03.570 --> 27:07.063
soaring birds from the
black belly of the sea.

27:08.410 --> 27:10.263
And yet it is green here.

27:13.938 --> 27:15.953
And the birds sing much the same.

27:16.870 --> 27:19.990
And all the land unfolds in pleasant hills

27:19.990 --> 27:21.963
much as in other times I've seen.

27:23.350 --> 27:26.300
Methinks it's chiefly men that change

27:27.500 --> 27:32.500
while nature, being no coy
strumpet nor no flattering maid

27:32.730 --> 27:36.270
keeps constant in her
heart that rare devotion

27:36.270 --> 27:39.253
that virtuous widows may aspire to show.

27:40.770 --> 27:42.700
- What art though?

27:42.700 --> 27:44.563
How come so hither, man?

27:46.050 --> 27:49.993
- My words, you speak my words.

27:49.993 --> 27:51.860
- I speak what words I'm given.

27:51.860 --> 27:52.930
I am a player.

27:52.930 --> 27:54.900
- And so was I.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.633
When time was mine to spend.

27:57.560 --> 28:00.380
I trod the boards of every princely stage

28:00.380 --> 28:04.140
and many coarser ones in muddy towns.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.630
Hey awry.

28:05.630 --> 28:07.500
It was such a game to play

28:07.500 --> 28:11.303
as might have tempted very
gods to join in blessed times.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.047
It is now long past, long gone.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.633
My time is gone.

28:23.100 --> 28:25.723
- You speak too sadly for a man so young.

28:26.950 --> 28:30.170
- Is sadness the monopoly of years?

28:30.170 --> 28:33.323
May only dotards know her sour sweet kiss.

28:34.620 --> 28:36.510
But I am not, perhaps, as young

28:36.510 --> 28:39.993
as you kind lady that
you are would have me be.

28:41.894 --> 28:43.800
What year is it?

28:43.800 --> 28:45.070
- You mock me, sir.

28:45.070 --> 28:46.990
- Why no such thing.

28:46.990 --> 28:48.470
You do me wrong to say it.

28:48.470 --> 28:52.530
Shall I mock the seat of such
a regal beauty as yours is?

28:52.530 --> 28:53.760
- And now you flatter.

28:53.760 --> 28:56.160
- You mistake again.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.830
Such words as would be flattery if untrue,

28:58.830 --> 29:03.130
when true are only sense,
I spoke my thought.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.030
- You are the strangest creature that ever

29:07.030 --> 29:08.693
I have chanced to look upon.

29:09.540 --> 29:10.950
- I'll call that gracious,

29:10.950 --> 29:13.670
for what's strange is bright.

29:13.670 --> 29:15.080
It stands against the dullness

29:15.080 --> 29:19.800
of the same like diamonds
gleaming in a pig sty.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.260
I'll be strange.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.650
If strange, be pleasing to you,

29:22.650 --> 29:27.640
let me be as plain,
uncanny as a sow with wings

29:27.640 --> 29:30.150
or as a fish that breaks
the prison of the sea

29:30.150 --> 29:34.160
and stepping onto land turns, bod,

29:34.160 --> 29:36.590
or blacksmith or what trade you will.

29:36.590 --> 29:40.823
- You are as strange to me as all of that.

29:42.213 --> 29:46.000
And if you are what I have think you are,

29:46.000 --> 29:49.120
you're even stranger, but it cannot be it.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.310
- Yet say it, lady.

29:50.310 --> 29:51.383
- I am loath to speak.

29:51.383 --> 29:52.793
- Then I'll speak for you.

29:54.450 --> 29:56.980
You have guessed my name, my nature

29:56.980 --> 29:59.300
and the place from whence I come.

29:59.300 --> 30:01.970
You call impossible the thing you see

30:01.970 --> 30:04.820
and, therefore, doubt
your eyes, your brain

30:04.820 --> 30:07.413
and every organ that gives man his sense.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.933
And yet is true.

30:12.530 --> 30:15.300
I stand before you now.

30:15.300 --> 30:18.250
If you interrogate your secrets so,

30:18.250 --> 30:20.813
you'll see you credit me in spite of all.

30:24.980 --> 30:26.210
What year is it?

30:27.080 --> 30:28.860
- 2019.

30:28.860 --> 30:29.810
- Oh!

30:29.810 --> 30:30.643
2019!

30:34.060 --> 30:39.060
Oh, brave humanity that
leaps through centuries

30:39.170 --> 30:41.770
with heedless bounds.

30:41.770 --> 30:43.880
That I should live to see so late a day

30:44.830 --> 30:47.980
and that the race of
man should still abide.

30:47.980 --> 30:51.220
Though time and all her
ravages had set their teeth

30:51.220 --> 30:56.220
into its tenuous walls,
great is my heart with praise

30:56.290 --> 30:58.143
for all mankind.

30:58.143 --> 31:02.030
That all our flags and
banners blend as one

31:02.030 --> 31:05.773
and let us march on to posterity
one arm linked in another,

31:07.090 --> 31:08.643
praise to man.

31:10.530 --> 31:12.823
- What's the last thing you remember?

31:14.463 --> 31:17.110
- A dream, a merest dream.

31:17.110 --> 31:19.130
I dreamed that down the centuries,

31:19.130 --> 31:24.130
my plays had strutted forth
to flaunt their gaudy trim

31:25.210 --> 31:28.070
and pale scholars stooping over books

31:28.070 --> 31:30.697
had argued this or that
to preen their brains.

31:30.697 --> 31:35.697
All this I saw, but saw
without belief for I was dead

31:37.760 --> 31:41.080
and thought the afterlife
must be this mute parade

31:41.080 --> 31:45.663
of living hopes, sweet
delirium of a mortal thing.

31:45.663 --> 31:47.780
- 'Tis true enough.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.520
Your name is so revered

31:49.520 --> 31:52.263
no other writer can come
close to touching it.

31:54.620 --> 31:56.003
- 'Tis wondrous strange.

31:58.319 --> 32:01.820
'Tis well desired, but is ill-deserved.

32:01.820 --> 32:04.170
What then of Marlowe or of Johnson too?

32:04.170 --> 32:05.003
They were my betters.

32:05.003 --> 32:06.170
Have they not their fame?

32:06.170 --> 32:07.423
- Nothing like yours.

32:09.650 --> 32:14.650
- It is a heathen world, a fallen place

32:14.940 --> 32:19.033
where chance and sin weigh
more than reason and devotion.

32:20.900 --> 32:22.373
Yet I'll not be grave.

32:23.430 --> 32:24.950
I am remembered.

32:24.950 --> 32:26.583
I strove not in vain.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.260
What play is it you play in here and now?

32:31.260 --> 32:32.810
- I play Lady Macbeth.

32:32.810 --> 32:34.980
- An excellent throne.

32:34.980 --> 32:36.730
Yet a peculiar play.

32:36.730 --> 32:38.028
What think you of this?

32:38.028 --> 32:40.060
- It's a challenge, yes.

32:40.060 --> 32:43.660
- A challenge, aye, that's admirably said.

32:43.660 --> 32:46.700
The play will seek to strive with you

32:46.700 --> 32:47.960
which one may be the better end

32:47.960 --> 32:49.257
with weapons drawn yourself

32:49.257 --> 32:53.640
and it shall fearsomely
contend, yet shrink not lady.

32:53.640 --> 32:57.290
If you win the day, the
spoils are such glory

32:57.290 --> 33:00.483
as the mind must reel to contemplate.

33:01.860 --> 33:03.270
And who's your King?

33:03.270 --> 33:04.790
- A knave, I fear.

33:04.790 --> 33:06.500
- Yet that's all one.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.163
A knave may speak as
fairly as an honest man.

33:09.163 --> 33:12.410
Let him not mumble, let his voice be keen,

33:12.410 --> 33:14.090
his carriage noble

33:14.090 --> 33:16.570
and I'll call the man the
knave of all my heart.

33:16.570 --> 33:18.100
When do you play?

33:18.100 --> 33:19.860
- Two weeks from Friday.

33:19.860 --> 33:21.113
- That's time enough.

33:25.312 --> 33:26.233
Who knows?

33:27.150 --> 33:31.380
But I may find some little
uses for myself in counseling

33:31.380 --> 33:33.960
which way the play must
bend to give its arrows

33:33.960 --> 33:36.570
their most worthy flight.

33:36.570 --> 33:40.773
For now, fair playeress, I take my leave.

33:42.400 --> 33:46.493
This mist must claim
me, for myself I mist,

33:47.480 --> 33:50.223
no more corporeal than are men's dreams.

33:51.270 --> 33:53.790
Goodnight, dear lady, when we meet again,

33:53.790 --> 33:55.990
we'll talk more to the purpose.

33:55.990 --> 33:58.883
Till that time, farewell.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.270
- So this is all playable space.

34:17.270 --> 34:18.320
- Yeah, all playable.

34:19.230 --> 34:22.060
That step is high, though,
so just keep that in mind.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.960
- Okay, good.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.150
It looks, it looks great.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.290
I just wanted to make sure
that I had it in my head.

34:27.290 --> 34:28.790
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks.

34:31.770 --> 34:32.603
- Morning, Adam

34:34.200 --> 34:36.970
- You look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

34:36.970 --> 34:38.610
- I just had a run, I feel great.

34:38.610 --> 34:41.160
Where do you get
all of this energy from?

34:41.160 --> 34:44.200
- Oh, I borrow it from
my future elderly self.

34:44.200 --> 34:46.280
She doesn't mind?

34:46.280 --> 34:47.113
- Who cares?

34:48.950 --> 34:49.783
- Am I late?

34:51.270 --> 34:53.650
- You, sir, are early.

34:53.650 --> 34:54.513
- Ah, shit.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.220
- You missed my Mercutio.

34:59.220 --> 35:01.230
You mean in 1978?

35:01.230 --> 35:03.120
- Ah, that's funny.

35:03.120 --> 35:04.620
No, you're very funny.

35:04.620 --> 35:06.360
Isn't he very funny?

35:06.360 --> 35:07.193
- Very.

35:12.418 --> 35:13.743
Hey.

35:13.743 --> 35:15.535
Hey.

35:15.535 --> 35:16.368
You all right?

35:16.368 --> 35:17.990
You look a little done in.

35:17.990 --> 35:18.823
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:18.823 --> 35:20.123
I just didn't sleep well.

35:21.470 --> 35:22.303
- Funny dreams?

35:23.560 --> 35:26.713
You know, I
don't think it was a dream,

35:27.873 --> 35:29.463
but it was definitely funny.

35:30.542 --> 35:32.197
You want to talk about it?

35:32.197 --> 35:34.780
- Um, I met someone last night.

35:37.001 --> 35:37.865
A man.

35:37.865 --> 35:38.914
- That was fast.

35:38.914 --> 35:39.997
- No, listen.

35:41.580 --> 35:43.090
He was sitting on a bench

35:43.090 --> 35:46.663
in the moonlight and he claimed to be,

35:47.750 --> 35:51.300
no, he didn't actually
claim to be anything,

35:51.300 --> 35:56.233
but he seemed like, he
acted like Shakespeare.

35:57.810 --> 35:59.013
- So he was a lunatic?

36:00.310 --> 36:01.920
- Maybe.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.090
But nah, he didn't strike me as that.

36:04.090 --> 36:09.090
He struck me as, not from here.

36:09.690 --> 36:11.348
- A foreign lunatic?

36:11.348 --> 36:12.359
- Well, you let me tell the story?

36:12.359 --> 36:13.940
- I'm sorry.

36:13.940 --> 36:16.680
- So he was sitting on that bench

36:16.680 --> 36:20.350
in the back garden and he was
playing some sort of flute.

36:20.350 --> 36:22.900
We had this incredible conversation.

36:22.900 --> 36:24.200
He said he would hang around

36:24.200 --> 36:26.534
and help out with our production.

36:26.534 --> 36:30.323
And then he kind of melted
away into the darkness.

36:33.110 --> 36:34.710
- You having any other symptoms?

36:35.960 --> 36:37.600
- Okay, he didn't melt away.

36:37.600 --> 36:42.600
He walked away, but there
was a melting quality to it.

36:44.220 --> 36:47.070
- Well, I would appreciate his help.

36:47.070 --> 36:47.903
- You're doing fine.

36:47.903 --> 36:50.830
- Well, I know, I know I'm doing fine.

36:50.830 --> 36:52.280
I wouldn't mind doing better.

36:53.350 --> 36:55.130
- If I see Shakespeare again,

36:55.130 --> 36:56.550
I will invite him to rehearsal.

36:56.550 --> 36:58.580
Thank you, just
don't tell the company.

36:58.580 --> 37:00.623
I think it might make
'em a little nervous.

37:00.623 --> 37:02.433
- I can't imagine why.

37:02.433 --> 37:05.093
- All right, let's get started everyone.

37:06.870 --> 37:09.660
- All right, can we take it
from lady M's entrance, please?

37:09.660 --> 37:11.300
And Syd, could you find his eye line

37:11.300 --> 37:12.280
just a little bit sooner

37:12.280 --> 37:15.040
so we don't have that
pause before how now?

37:15.040 --> 37:17.130
- Got it.
- Thank you.

37:17.130 --> 37:18.780
All right, whenever you're ready.

37:18.780 --> 37:20.650
- Lauren, can you give me
the starter line please?

37:20.650 --> 37:23.737
- I have no spirit.
- Thank you, got it.

37:25.530 --> 37:27.700
- I have no spirit to prick
the sides of mine intent

37:27.700 --> 37:29.350
but only vaulting ambition,

37:29.350 --> 37:31.560
which all leaps itself and falls on the...

37:31.560 --> 37:32.560
How now, what news?

37:32.560 --> 37:33.520
- He has almost supped.

37:33.520 --> 37:34.750
Why have you left the chamber?

37:34.750 --> 37:35.800
- Hath he asked for me?

37:35.800 --> 37:37.023
- No you not he has.

37:41.110 --> 37:43.410
- We will proceed no
further in this business.

37:44.261 --> 37:45.830
He hath honored me of late,

37:45.830 --> 37:48.810
and I have bought golden opinions
from all sorts of people,

37:49.643 --> 37:50.743
Jesus Christ!

37:54.980 --> 37:56.530
- Is everyone all right?

37:56.530 --> 37:57.850
- I'm fine.

37:57.850 --> 37:59.300
I'm fine, Jesus Christ.

37:59.300 --> 38:00.370
- Sydney, you okay?

38:00.370 --> 38:01.833
- Uh, yes, yes.

38:03.110 --> 38:05.583
- Okay, well, that's not good.

38:13.620 --> 38:15.130
I'll call maintenance.

38:15.130 --> 38:15.963
- Good idea.

38:18.579 --> 38:21.450
- It was a chunk of stone
bigger than my head.

38:21.450 --> 38:22.510
It was sizeable.

38:22.510 --> 38:24.520
I could hear it whistle
as it came down by my ear.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.680
I could feel the wind on my face.

38:26.680 --> 38:29.540
It almost gave me a
shave, it was that close.

38:29.540 --> 38:33.730
And when it hit the floor,
there was this resounding thunk.

38:33.730 --> 38:37.393
I could feel the whole stage
vibrate like an earthquake.

38:38.250 --> 38:40.976
I swear I could feel my teeth rattle.

38:40.976 --> 38:43.440
It hit with that much force.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.600
- You must have been scared witless?

38:45.600 --> 38:47.840
- I don't mind telling you that I was.

38:47.840 --> 38:49.300
My heart was in my mouth.

38:49.300 --> 38:50.960
I stopped breathing.

38:50.960 --> 38:53.860
I knew what it was that had
missed me by a hair's breadth.

38:54.780 --> 38:55.653
There was death.

38:58.046 --> 39:02.141
- Well, I'm just glad nobody was hurt.

39:02.141 --> 39:04.810
- So am I, so am I.

39:04.810 --> 39:09.280
You know, in a way, I'm
glad that it happened to me.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.610
If it had happened to one
of the younger cast members,

39:11.610 --> 39:14.850
it might have scared them
out of the business for life.

39:14.850 --> 39:16.580
- I admire your courage, Hugh.

39:16.580 --> 39:17.940
- It's not courage.

39:17.940 --> 39:20.370
It's pure cussedness.

39:20.370 --> 39:21.470
They're gonna have to carry me

39:21.470 --> 39:23.270
out of that theater on a stretcher.

39:23.270 --> 39:26.161
And even then I'll be reciting
King Lear as I go out.

39:29.435 --> 39:32.790
- So what do you think,
you think I was was wrong

39:32.790 --> 39:34.140
to make light of the curse?

39:36.100 --> 39:38.150
- Let the witches bring it on, my friend.

39:39.520 --> 39:40.570
Let them bring it on.

40:13.960 --> 40:16.256
- Mr. Shakespeare?

40:19.040 --> 40:20.573
Mr. Shakespeare?

40:23.492 --> 40:24.325
Will?

40:25.461 --> 40:27.920
- What silkened throated
nymph calls to me now?

40:27.920 --> 40:32.363
What voice too tender
for this too harsh world?

40:34.120 --> 40:37.290
It is the lady I beheld last night

40:37.290 --> 40:39.810
whose image never since has quit mine eye,

40:39.810 --> 40:42.940
but lingers there impervious today

40:42.940 --> 40:46.230
in all the coarser sights
the day thrusts on.

40:46.230 --> 40:47.660
Why so pale, my lady?

40:47.660 --> 40:49.840
Why so wild of eye?

40:49.840 --> 40:52.440
Faith, anyone would
think you'd seen a ghost.

40:52.440 --> 40:54.130
- Something's happened.

40:54.130 --> 40:55.600
- I can guess it well.

40:55.600 --> 40:58.520
But what has chanced and
why it frights you so,

40:58.520 --> 41:02.440
I do confess beyond my skill to know.

41:02.440 --> 41:03.950
- You weren't at the theater?

41:03.950 --> 41:07.410
- I wonder as I told you here and yon

41:07.410 --> 41:10.490
in insubstantial shadows till you call.

41:10.490 --> 41:13.190
- A piece of ceiling fell onto the stage,

41:13.190 --> 41:15.790
inches from Hugh, it almost killed him.

41:15.790 --> 41:18.450
- Is Hugh a player?

41:18.450 --> 41:19.583
- Yes, a very good one.

41:19.583 --> 41:22.480
- Then it is not well, a
play must well be played.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.990
Is he sore wounded?

41:23.990 --> 41:26.580
Does he speak or see?

41:26.580 --> 41:29.530
- He's all right, but it was a close call.

41:29.530 --> 41:31.770
- It is no matter then,
what's well is well.

41:31.770 --> 41:33.740
To escape the lion by a hair's breadth

41:33.740 --> 41:35.890
is as good as never entering the den.

41:35.890 --> 41:38.700
- Uh, I don't take it so lightly.

41:38.700 --> 41:43.000
- So I see, but you are female

41:43.000 --> 41:47.100
and of such stuff made that
like the strings of lutes

41:47.100 --> 41:51.410
when tensely strung, you
vibrate at the touch.

41:51.410 --> 41:53.580
- That's not the point.

41:53.580 --> 41:57.570
And besides we don't
think that way anymore.

41:57.570 --> 41:59.140
- What way is that?

41:59.140 --> 42:02.630
- That women are so
delicate and sensitive.

42:02.630 --> 42:07.630
It's not, well, it turns
out not to be true.

42:09.420 --> 42:10.860
- Faith, you amaze me.

42:10.860 --> 42:13.283
- Yeah, well, sorry.

42:16.730 --> 42:19.580
- I did think you had a sort of manliness

42:19.580 --> 42:22.350
about you too, a vigor and a willfulness,

42:22.350 --> 42:25.780
perhaps, not wholly
female that became you.

42:25.780 --> 42:30.780
Well, man's courage in a
graceful female shape 'tis odd.

42:31.360 --> 42:33.830
'Tis wondrous odd, provoking odd,

42:33.830 --> 42:37.910
and I'll begrudge it
not, it moves me quite.

42:37.910 --> 42:39.300
- You knew women like this.

42:39.300 --> 42:42.923
I know you did, I've read your plays.

42:42.923 --> 42:45.400
- Nay, you speak true.

42:45.400 --> 42:49.940
And if the world now stands
as peopled with such creatures

42:49.940 --> 42:54.940
as the sea is dense with
teeming fish, I like it well.

42:54.950 --> 42:57.797
All women queens and all queens worthy,

42:57.797 --> 42:59.630
that is no mean world.

43:01.251 --> 43:02.084
- Well, you know, we're working on it.

43:05.730 --> 43:07.110
- But I digress as I am won't to do.

43:07.110 --> 43:09.340
Methinks you had a purpose coming here

43:09.340 --> 43:10.930
which I have less than answered.

43:10.930 --> 43:11.763
Speak your mind.

43:19.140 --> 43:20.803
- Is there a curse on Macbeth?

43:22.580 --> 43:24.410
It's been a theater legend for centuries.

43:24.410 --> 43:25.700
The play was cursed by witches.

43:25.700 --> 43:27.850
I never believed it.

43:27.850 --> 43:28.693
Is it true?

43:32.660 --> 43:35.903
- There is something in it.

43:37.360 --> 43:39.113
- Can you tell me why?

43:44.350 --> 43:46.070
- I knew a witch

43:46.070 --> 43:47.823
when I was very young.

43:49.700 --> 43:52.220
She came to live in Stratford

43:52.220 --> 43:55.690
and her house was very near my father's.

43:55.690 --> 43:58.780
We became, I'll not say friends,

43:58.780 --> 44:01.780
for time proved otherwise,
but such acquaintances

44:01.780 --> 44:05.610
as might find time to wander
by the river side by side

44:05.610 --> 44:10.610
and talk of slight and
unremembered things.

44:11.350 --> 44:13.770
One day, my father learned of this

44:13.770 --> 44:18.770
and swore I should be banished
from his house for life,

44:19.320 --> 44:23.363
if I broke not my concourse with a witch.

44:24.640 --> 44:27.870
This thing I did, for I was young, unripe,

44:27.870 --> 44:31.853
and very fearful of my father's wrath.

44:34.730 --> 44:38.350
Some 12 years later in a London street,

44:38.350 --> 44:39.510
we chanced to meet again,

44:39.510 --> 44:43.230
and being now some ways toward manhood,

44:43.230 --> 44:48.190
I now saw the witch in
such a different light

44:48.190 --> 44:52.730
that we became, I'll not say lovers,

44:52.730 --> 44:54.770
for it was not love,

44:54.770 --> 44:59.770
but something that was
more and less than friends.

45:01.260 --> 45:04.510
From her, I drew the secrets of Macbeth,

45:04.510 --> 45:07.670
the rites the witches
do perform and speak.

45:07.670 --> 45:09.810
And when at last the play became itself

45:09.810 --> 45:11.240
and went before the public,

45:11.240 --> 45:16.240
she was wrought into
such fury at my impudence

45:17.950 --> 45:20.770
that much I fear she did contrive a spell

45:20.770 --> 45:24.390
to turn its fortunes into curdled fears

45:24.390 --> 45:27.579
and all its glory to such sour laments

45:27.579 --> 45:30.933
that after times would
speak its name with scorn.

45:35.620 --> 45:37.003
This came to pass.

45:38.350 --> 45:42.400
And now my pretty play
like some fair maiden

45:42.400 --> 45:46.350
stunted in her youth is left
to hobble after happiness

45:46.350 --> 45:50.830
while other lesser but more blessed things

45:50.830 --> 45:52.983
trip gaily to their joy.

45:54.792 --> 45:55.873
'Tis hard.

45:57.430 --> 45:59.020
'Tis hard.

45:59.020 --> 46:02.890
- But the play's enormously popular.

46:02.890 --> 46:04.610
What kind of curse is that?

46:04.610 --> 46:06.270
'Tis infamy, not fame.

46:06.270 --> 46:09.460
The players loved for bringing
on disaster, not delight.

46:09.460 --> 46:10.490
- I think you're wrong.

46:10.490 --> 46:12.600
- Well, we'll not argue it.

46:12.600 --> 46:13.610
What's done is done.

46:13.610 --> 46:17.260
Or so the saying goes, what
may be done, man wonders

46:17.260 --> 46:18.733
and God knows.

46:20.520 --> 46:24.513
- Is there a way to lift the curse?

46:26.380 --> 46:28.920
I'd rather not get crushed by bricks,

46:28.920 --> 46:29.770
if I can help it.

46:30.940 --> 46:31.873
- I'll ponder it.

46:33.800 --> 46:35.313
And now I'll say good night.

46:36.870 --> 46:40.623
Playing truth may come to
view with dawn's plain light.

46:53.440 --> 46:56.540
- Okay, everybody, if I
could have your attention.

46:56.540 --> 46:58.630
We have had the roof
thoroughly checked out

46:58.630 --> 47:00.780
and there is no sign of
any structural problem

47:00.780 --> 47:02.450
or any more loose masonry.

47:02.450 --> 47:04.260
Obviously, safety is our first priority.

47:04.260 --> 47:07.340
If you feel uncomfortable
or unsafe at any point,

47:07.340 --> 47:09.610
please come to me and we'll work it out.

47:09.610 --> 47:11.100
Okay?

47:11.100 --> 47:13.330
Okay, Adam, stage is yours.

47:13.330 --> 47:14.510
- Thank you.

47:14.510 --> 47:17.400
Why don't we pick up where
we left off yesterday?

47:17.400 --> 47:19.963
Can I get Hugh and Sydney
up on the stage please?

47:24.740 --> 47:25.573
- You all right?

47:25.573 --> 47:28.250
- Yeah, yeah, just tired.

47:28.250 --> 47:29.800
- Had trouble sleeping?

47:29.800 --> 47:30.870
- A little.

47:30.870 --> 47:33.420
- Oh, what you need is
a good bedtime ritual.

47:33.420 --> 47:34.830
It works wonders.

47:34.830 --> 47:38.270
- Oh, do you have any suggestions?

47:38.270 --> 47:39.650
- I have a few thoughts.

47:39.650 --> 47:42.830
- Okay, can we go from the
top of the soliloquy please?

47:42.830 --> 47:43.700
- We'll talk later.

47:43.700 --> 47:44.883
- Oh, I have no doubt.

47:46.930 --> 47:50.550
- If it were done when
'tis done, then 'twere well

47:50.550 --> 47:52.400
it were done quickly.

47:52.400 --> 47:55.220
If the assassination could
trammel up the consequence,

47:56.630 --> 47:58.203
with his surcease.

48:00.460 --> 48:01.780
- You okay, Hugh?

48:01.780 --> 48:02.923
- I'm fine, fine.

48:03.850 --> 48:05.300
And catch with his surcease.

48:05.300 --> 48:06.280
Can we get him some water?

48:06.280 --> 48:07.980
No, hot tea.

48:07.980 --> 48:09.370
With honey.

48:09.370 --> 48:10.318
And whiskey.

48:10.318 --> 48:11.151
- Do we have whiskey?

48:11.151 --> 48:11.984
I'll make it happen.

48:11.984 --> 48:12.970
- Thank you.

48:12.970 --> 48:13.870
- Sorry, everyone.

48:15.640 --> 48:17.190
Too late a night of it, I guess.

48:17.190 --> 48:18.230
- That's all right, Hugh.

48:18.230 --> 48:19.083
Come take a seat.

48:20.367 --> 48:21.200
- Yeah.

48:22.276 --> 48:23.109
Yeah, okay.

48:24.670 --> 48:26.240
Sorry.

48:26.240 --> 48:29.020
- Can we, do we have the porter?

48:29.020 --> 48:30.720
- Tom's not called till afternoon.

48:30.720 --> 48:33.650
- Well, Lucas, are you memorized
for act four, scene three.

48:33.650 --> 48:35.060
- I think so, mostly.

48:35.060 --> 48:35.893
Sean?

48:35.893 --> 48:36.910
- Born for it.

48:36.910 --> 48:39.420
- Great, let's get 43 up on its feet.

48:39.420 --> 48:40.970
And you can have book in hand

48:40.970 --> 48:42.270
if it makes you more comfortable.

48:42.270 --> 48:43.180
- No, I'll risk it.

48:43.180 --> 48:44.013
- Good man.

48:45.280 --> 48:46.113
Sorry, Syd.

48:47.390 --> 48:49.890
- No, no, I'm just worried about Hugh.

48:49.890 --> 48:50.723
- Oh, he's fine.

48:50.723 --> 48:53.223
He's just partying a little too hard.

48:54.900 --> 48:56.497
- You think that's it?

48:57.543 --> 48:58.543
- Yeah, why?

48:59.560 --> 49:00.393
- No reason.

49:01.490 --> 49:02.323
Do your job.

49:04.870 --> 49:06.663
- All right guys, whenever you're ready.

49:09.850 --> 49:12.400
- If such a one be fit to govern, speak.

49:12.400 --> 49:13.720
I am as I have spoken.

49:13.720 --> 49:17.130
- Fit to govern, no, not to live.

49:17.130 --> 49:20.830
Oh, nation miserable
with an untitled tyrant,

49:20.830 --> 49:23.450
bloody-sceptered, when will thou see

49:23.450 --> 49:25.710
thy wholesome days again.

49:25.710 --> 49:27.550
Since that the truest issue of thy throne

49:27.550 --> 49:29.920
by his own interdiction stands accursed

49:29.920 --> 49:32.073
and does blaspheme his breed?

49:33.410 --> 49:35.327
Thy royal father was a most sainted king.

49:35.327 --> 49:36.826
- This is not a good play.

49:38.060 --> 49:40.203
No, I'm sorry, but it's not.

49:40.203 --> 49:41.603
It's too unfocused.

49:42.860 --> 49:44.260
And whose play is it anyway?

49:45.260 --> 49:46.930
It's not Macbeth's.

49:46.930 --> 49:49.067
I mean, he disappears
for long stretches of it

49:49.067 --> 49:51.570
and he hardly ever
really drives the action.

49:51.570 --> 49:52.770
It's not Lady Macbeth.

49:52.770 --> 49:55.803
She goes to pieces a full
act before the climax.

49:57.310 --> 49:59.183
I guess it's Macduff's play, really.

50:01.410 --> 50:02.323
Maybe Malcolm's?

50:03.630 --> 50:05.430
But are they two distinct characters

50:06.300 --> 50:08.003
or just virtuous blanks?

50:09.690 --> 50:10.880
Sorry, it's a mess.

50:10.880 --> 50:14.983
It's a mess with with some
beautiful language, but still.

50:15.820 --> 50:18.960
- You shouldn't say things like that.

50:18.960 --> 50:20.270
- Why not, it's true.

50:20.270 --> 50:21.103
- It doesn't matter.

50:21.103 --> 50:22.243
You just shouldn't say it.

50:24.260 --> 50:25.430
- Why?

50:25.430 --> 50:26.630
- Because it's bad luck.

50:29.554 --> 50:30.387
- Well.

50:44.079 --> 50:46.735
Listen, I
said you could tag along

50:46.735 --> 50:49.040
to research your book.

50:49.040 --> 50:51.008
But you gotta follow my lead.

50:51.008 --> 50:52.758
Let's keep it simple.

50:54.349 --> 50:57.182
I hear you, Snowman.

51:11.659 --> 51:12.492
- Will!

51:15.973 --> 51:16.806
Will!

51:20.934 --> 51:21.767
Will!

51:53.480 --> 51:55.760
Holy shit!

51:55.760 --> 51:57.920
- Be calm, good lady.

51:57.920 --> 52:00.050
Women are as men in this late time

52:00.050 --> 52:02.260
as you know passing well.

52:02.260 --> 52:05.110
Therefore, no matter if I do intrude,

52:05.110 --> 52:09.260
we are two men in
conference, nothing more.

52:09.260 --> 52:11.080
- It's not your gender that worries me.

52:11.080 --> 52:13.290
It's that you're in my goddamned room.

52:13.290 --> 52:15.450
- 'Tis not damned that I can see.

52:15.450 --> 52:19.870
I think it is as fine a room
as might be wished and blessed

52:19.870 --> 52:22.180
moreover by your body's grace

52:22.180 --> 52:25.283
and all your sweet possessions.

52:26.140 --> 52:27.163
Excellent room.

52:28.480 --> 52:30.380
- Why are you here?

52:30.380 --> 52:32.220
- A smallest reason.

52:32.220 --> 52:37.220
I have pages here which will,
when folded into my main text,

52:38.630 --> 52:41.240
mend somewhat of the clumsiness that mars

52:41.240 --> 52:44.090
the otherwise fine surface of the play.

52:44.090 --> 52:45.330
I'll leave them here with you.

52:45.330 --> 52:48.990
And when you think it meet
deliver them unto your manager.

52:48.990 --> 52:52.840
He'll see their worth
at once, if he be wise.

52:52.840 --> 52:56.050
If not come find me and I'll make him see.

52:56.050 --> 52:57.900
- We're two weeks from performance.

52:57.900 --> 52:59.290
- Aye, there's time.

52:59.290 --> 53:02.550
A week's a year when
stage work is in hand.

53:02.550 --> 53:04.010
- Will, I don't think I can do this.

53:04.010 --> 53:05.180
- Nay, you can.

53:05.180 --> 53:07.460
It is well within your
power and your rights.

53:07.460 --> 53:09.650
- Why don't you take it to Adam yourself?

53:09.650 --> 53:12.190
- You are my anchor in this tainted world.

53:12.190 --> 53:13.370
The fates have willed it so.

53:13.370 --> 53:14.723
I know not why.

53:20.330 --> 53:21.863
- Why do you speak in verse?

53:23.010 --> 53:23.843
- I beg your pardon.

53:23.843 --> 53:24.890
What mean you by that?

53:24.890 --> 53:27.288
- That, that is what I mean.

53:27.288 --> 53:29.210
Iambic pentameter.

53:29.210 --> 53:31.940
You talk like a character
in one of your plays,

53:31.940 --> 53:34.570
but that doesn't make any sense.

53:34.570 --> 53:37.250
No one spoke that way
in Elizabethan England.

53:37.250 --> 53:39.450
It was a convention of the stage.

53:39.450 --> 53:41.351
That's not how people talked.

53:44.200 --> 53:47.280
- When you have had
four centuries to muse,

53:47.280 --> 53:50.440
to pine, to wallow in the sainted word,

53:50.440 --> 53:53.100
you'll find the music of the speech

53:53.100 --> 53:57.943
you dreamed contains a substance
that it lacked in life.

53:58.780 --> 54:02.610
I speak as I have always wished to speak

54:02.610 --> 54:07.610
with bright precision
and with chosen grace.

54:08.420 --> 54:10.520
- So it's not because you're a genius.

54:10.520 --> 54:12.070
It's because you're a ghost.

54:12.070 --> 54:13.470
- Can not one man be both?

54:13.470 --> 54:14.853
You are unkind.

54:15.700 --> 54:17.980
- Will, listen to me.

54:17.980 --> 54:21.630
- Upon my honor, where we not both men,

54:21.630 --> 54:24.980
I might make free with
certain choice remarks

54:24.980 --> 54:27.080
regarding these your garments

54:27.080 --> 54:32.010
and the shapes that they too
thickly veil to briefly show.

54:32.010 --> 54:33.750
- Don't be a pig.

54:33.750 --> 54:36.020
- Admiration is nothing bestial.

54:36.020 --> 54:39.480
Why, heaven herself doth
grant man's poor eye

54:39.480 --> 54:41.980
the wisdom to discern a fairer grace.

54:41.980 --> 54:42.813
- Will!

54:45.270 --> 54:47.010
- I cry your mercy, lady.

54:47.010 --> 54:48.053
What's your will?

54:51.610 --> 54:55.290
- I asked you if you could lift the curse.

54:55.290 --> 54:58.600
- And I have thought upon it.

54:58.600 --> 55:01.560
This poor sheath, imperfect as it is,

55:01.560 --> 55:06.560
may make some change upon the
workings of this damned play

55:06.740 --> 55:09.470
that yields a better music to the ear

55:09.470 --> 55:12.993
of that coarse witch
whose anger hexed it so.

55:13.990 --> 55:15.930
- That isn't what you
said two minutes ago.

55:15.930 --> 55:16.960
- And you must pardon me.

55:16.960 --> 55:20.790
I clean forgot amid the
rash excitement of my art

55:20.790 --> 55:24.140
that all my skill this
time has been to save you

55:24.140 --> 55:27.920
and your fellows from this ancient blight.

55:27.920 --> 55:28.910
- I don't believe you.

55:28.910 --> 55:31.170
This is just that thing where playwrights

55:31.170 --> 55:32.890
tinker with a piece that's done.

55:32.890 --> 55:35.310
- I'll not deny that vice has been my own,

55:35.310 --> 55:39.300
but if my name's as sacred as you claim

55:39.300 --> 55:41.910
would not your manager and all your troop

55:41.910 --> 55:45.200
show plain delight that
I should tinker thus.

55:45.200 --> 55:47.010
- They won't believe it.

55:47.010 --> 55:49.410
I have not myself.

55:49.410 --> 55:51.433
- You doubt me still.

55:52.690 --> 55:54.623
Then I must furnish proof.

55:57.090 --> 56:01.560
When last we met, I said my
time was spent in dismal shadows

56:01.560 --> 56:06.560
in mute veils of gray, but as
your image flourishes in me

56:07.360 --> 56:09.620
and blooms full colored in my secret,

56:09.620 --> 56:14.490
so I find my world and my gray body too

56:14.490 --> 56:18.773
grow clear and solid
as the things of life.

56:20.930 --> 56:22.023
Come touch me.

56:23.490 --> 56:26.060
I am no pale shade, no trembling spirit,

56:26.060 --> 56:29.100
but a sinewed man.

56:29.100 --> 56:32.300
You have made me thus
by calling me from sleep

56:33.550 --> 56:35.870
with your bewitching presence

56:35.870 --> 56:39.513
and your kind yet all too stubborn heart.

56:40.640 --> 56:45.510
Now, touch my face and see what flesh

56:45.510 --> 56:47.183
your grace has made of me.

57:08.440 --> 57:11.420
- This proves the opposite
of what you claim.

57:11.420 --> 57:13.550
You can't be Shakespeare
and be flesh and blood.

57:13.550 --> 57:15.700
Will, Shakespeare died 400 years ago.

57:15.700 --> 57:17.840
- Yet Shakespeare stands before you.

57:17.840 --> 57:22.120
Call it strange, call it
uncanny and impossible.

57:22.120 --> 57:23.663
Yet 'tis the truth.

57:24.520 --> 57:28.543
And in your truest heart, you
know me to be truly what I am.

57:33.420 --> 57:38.170
Will you these words deliver to your troop

57:38.170 --> 57:41.310
that my unlucky play may have some hope

57:41.310 --> 57:44.143
of overcoming its long years of shame?

57:46.760 --> 57:47.593
- I will.

57:49.112 --> 57:50.713
- For this, I humbly thank you.

57:54.510 --> 57:57.563
Now, it is time for me to
melt away in shadows dark.

58:01.920 --> 58:04.860
If still you doubt that I am magic made

58:04.860 --> 58:07.520
by magic summoned and made palpable,

58:07.520 --> 58:12.070
observe this wall and
how this human flesh,

58:12.070 --> 58:13.740
which not long since you touched,

58:13.740 --> 58:18.660
considers it as slighter thing as dreams

58:18.660 --> 58:23.660
or wishes vain or men when
they are dead or heart or life.

58:29.026 --> 58:29.859
- Oh!

59:12.590 --> 59:16.030
- The sun is high and I am up.

59:16.030 --> 59:21.030
Is coffee brewed for I do crave a cup.

59:21.150 --> 59:22.640
- It sounds like you have your voice back.

59:22.640 --> 59:25.430
- Oh, sound as a bell, sound as a bell.

59:25.430 --> 59:27.330
All I really needed was
a good night's rest.

59:27.330 --> 59:30.820
So I guess you won't have to
do "Macbeth" without Macbeth.

59:30.820 --> 59:32.340
I had a backup plan.

59:32.340 --> 59:33.240
- Oh really, what was it?

59:33.240 --> 59:34.610
- Kenneth Branagh.

59:34.610 --> 59:35.443
- Liar.

59:37.160 --> 59:39.423
- Uh, Adam, can I talk
to you for a second?

59:40.490 --> 59:42.380
- Sure, of course.

59:42.380 --> 59:46.120
- Actor secrets or Sydney secrets?

59:46.120 --> 59:47.930
- Mind your business, Hugh.

59:47.930 --> 59:49.280
- It's never worked for me.

59:54.470 --> 59:59.350
- Okay, remember how I told
you about meeting Shakespeare?

59:59.350 --> 1:00:00.420
- You said you've met someone

1:00:00.420 --> 1:00:02.570
who claimed to be.
- Adam, it's him.

1:00:02.570 --> 1:00:06.003
- I know it's crazy, but it's
him, and he gave me something.

1:00:09.030 --> 1:00:09.940
- What is this?

1:00:09.940 --> 1:00:10.890
- It's a rewrite.

1:00:10.890 --> 1:00:11.723
- A rewrite of what?

1:00:11.723 --> 1:00:12.556
- "Macbeth".

1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:18.157
- Okay, now you actually
have me concerned.

1:00:19.860 --> 1:00:24.130
- Okay, I'll tell you what, you read that

1:00:24.130 --> 1:00:25.360
and then you come and tell me

1:00:25.360 --> 1:00:28.260
this was not written
by William Shakespeare.

1:00:28.260 --> 1:00:29.210
- I don't have time to read that.

1:00:29.210 --> 1:00:31.103
- Are you kidding me?
- Okay, okay.

1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:37.190
Okay, so I will read this.

1:00:37.190 --> 1:00:38.330
Yes.

1:00:38.330 --> 1:00:40.460
- And then I will come find you.

1:00:40.460 --> 1:00:41.570
- Yes.
- Okay.

1:00:41.570 --> 1:00:42.403
- Okay.

1:00:43.430 --> 1:00:44.323
- Anything else?

1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:47.713
- I'd kill for some breakfast.

1:00:49.810 --> 1:00:50.723
- Well, you might have to the way

1:00:50.723 --> 1:00:52.213
that Hugh was piling it on.

1:01:02.385 --> 1:01:07.290
- Prithee, peace, I dare do
all that may become a man

1:01:07.290 --> 1:01:09.290
who dares do more is none.

1:01:09.290 --> 1:01:10.570
- What beast was't, then,

1:01:10.570 --> 1:01:13.150
that made you break this enterprise to me?

1:01:13.150 --> 1:01:16.290
When you durst do it, then you were a man

1:01:16.290 --> 1:01:17.830
and to be more than what you were,

1:01:17.830 --> 1:01:20.563
you would be so much more the man.

1:01:21.550 --> 1:01:23.860
Nor time nor place did then adhere,

1:01:23.860 --> 1:01:25.493
and yet you would make both.

1:01:26.410 --> 1:01:29.360
They have made themselves,
and that their fitness now

1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:30.763
does unmake you.

1:01:32.370 --> 1:01:36.410
I have given suck, and know how tender

1:01:36.410 --> 1:01:39.233
'tis to love the babe that milks me.

1:01:40.180 --> 1:01:44.250
I would, when it was smiling in my face,

1:01:44.250 --> 1:01:47.160
have plucked my nipple
from his boneless gums

1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:50.200
and dashed the brains
out, had I so sworn as you

1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:51.811
have done to this.

1:01:51.811 --> 1:01:52.960
- If we should fail?

1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:54.003
- We fail?

1:01:54.940 --> 1:01:57.960
But screw your courage
to the sticking-place,

1:01:57.960 --> 1:01:59.953
and we'll not fail.

1:02:01.130 --> 1:02:04.640
When Duncan is asleep,
whereto the rather shall

1:02:04.640 --> 1:02:07.690
his day's hard journey soundly invite him,

1:02:07.690 --> 1:02:10.520
his two chamberlains will I with wine

1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:12.860
and while so convince that memory,

1:02:12.860 --> 1:02:13.800
the warder of the brain,

1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:18.060
shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason

1:02:18.060 --> 1:02:22.700
a limbeck only, when in swinish sleep

1:02:22.700 --> 1:02:25.600
their drenched natures lie as in a death.

1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:27.760
What cannot you and I perform upon

1:02:27.760 --> 1:02:30.090
the unguarded Duncan?

1:02:30.090 --> 1:02:33.090
What not put upon his spongy officers,

1:02:33.090 --> 1:02:37.233
who shall bear the guilt
of our great quell?

1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:40.473
- Bring forth men-children only,

1:02:41.810 --> 1:02:45.993
for thy undaunted mettle should
compose nothing but males.

1:02:51.870 --> 1:02:53.260
Will it not be received,

1:02:53.260 --> 1:02:55.670
when we have marked with
blood those sleepy two

1:02:55.670 --> 1:02:59.330
of his own chamber and
used their very daggers,

1:02:59.330 --> 1:03:00.520
That they have done 't?

1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:02.500
- Who dares receive it other,

1:03:02.500 --> 1:03:06.930
as we shall make our griefs
and clamor roar upon his death?

1:03:06.930 --> 1:03:10.650
- I am settled, and bend
up each corporal agent

1:03:10.650 --> 1:03:11.833
to this terrible feat.

1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:18.210
Away, and mock the time with fairest show.

1:03:18.210 --> 1:03:22.063
False face must hide what
the false heart doth know.

1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:32.390
- Yes, yes!

1:03:32.390 --> 1:03:34.523
Now, that is some goddamned Shakespeare!

1:03:35.580 --> 1:03:37.840
Beautiful, guys, it's
just really beautiful.

1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:39.253
How's it feel?

1:03:39.253 --> 1:03:40.710
- Uh, it's getting there?

1:03:40.710 --> 1:03:42.380
- Oh, well, I'm happy if you are.

1:03:42.380 --> 1:03:44.640
- So happy, I'm so happy.

1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:46.253
What is 'tis the clock?

1:03:47.260 --> 1:03:48.310
- 10 of.

1:03:48.310 --> 1:03:49.880
- Let's end the day on that note.

1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:52.040
Great work, everybody.

1:03:52.040 --> 1:03:52.873
Wow.

1:03:53.950 --> 1:03:55.930
We're gonna plunge into act two tomorrow.

1:03:55.930 --> 1:03:58.980
So look over your lines and get some rest.

1:03:58.980 --> 1:04:00.710
Thank you so much.

1:04:00.710 --> 1:04:02.280
- So much for your bad luck.

1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:04.030
- Christ, don't say that

1:04:10.460 --> 1:04:11.293
- Adam.

1:04:11.293 --> 1:04:12.126
- Yeah?

1:04:12.126 --> 1:04:12.959
You coming out?

1:04:12.959 --> 1:04:14.107
A bunch of us are
heading to Crown Headler.

1:04:14.107 --> 1:04:15.860
- Oh, I, I can't.

1:04:15.860 --> 1:04:17.160
I have some reading to do.

1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:20.180
- How about after reading?

1:04:23.030 --> 1:04:24.130
- We'll see.

1:04:24.130 --> 1:04:25.623
- Yeah, we'll see means no.

1:04:26.700 --> 1:04:28.140
- Means we'll see.

1:04:28.140 --> 1:04:29.500
- You're impossible.

1:04:29.500 --> 1:04:30.678
- Sorry.

1:04:30.678 --> 1:04:31.528
- Don't be sorry.

1:04:32.750 --> 1:04:33.630
It's your loss

1:04:49.870 --> 1:04:52.650
- Yet if I life and all its bright renown

1:04:52.650 --> 1:04:54.963
be severed from the fabric of thy work,

1:04:55.840 --> 1:04:58.463
it is a blessing in a curse's gown,

1:04:59.310 --> 1:05:02.950
a gleaming diamond set in dimmest Merck

1:05:02.950 --> 1:05:07.350
for poets live through
poetry and, thus, by life,

1:05:07.350 --> 1:05:11.433
by true life, is attained in us.

1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:14.720
- It's wonderful.

1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:16.796
It's wonderful, who wrote it?

1:05:16.796 --> 1:05:17.629
- Sydney?

1:05:18.480 --> 1:05:20.393
- Oh, I don't know, Tennyson?

1:05:22.230 --> 1:05:23.713
- It was Hugh Painter.

1:05:24.970 --> 1:05:26.563
- Seriously.
- Oh yes.

1:05:26.563 --> 1:05:28.770
- That's very good, Hugh.

1:05:28.770 --> 1:05:31.170
- I thank thee lady for thy fair report.

1:05:31.170 --> 1:05:33.570
Yet I'm aggrieved to
find thee so surprised.

1:05:33.570 --> 1:05:37.120
- Well, I had no idea you were a writer.

1:05:37.120 --> 1:05:38.010
- I dabbled.

1:05:38.010 --> 1:05:41.020
It's all hopelessly
old-fashioned, of course.

1:05:41.020 --> 1:05:44.293
And then again, all the best things are.

1:05:47.040 --> 1:05:50.380
- If you will excuse me a moment.

1:05:50.380 --> 1:05:52.240
I am going to go and check on Adam.

1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:54.790
- Would you tell him to get
in here and be sociable?

1:05:54.790 --> 1:05:57.580
I mean that boy works too hard.

1:05:57.580 --> 1:05:59.080
It's not good for the soul.

1:05:59.080 --> 1:05:59.913
- I'll tell him.

1:05:59.913 --> 1:06:00.746
- Thank you.

1:06:02.203 --> 1:06:05.140
- Now, this is going to seem
like a very ignorant question.

1:06:05.140 --> 1:06:09.330
- Oh, my dear lady, there
are no ignorant questions.

1:06:09.330 --> 1:06:12.563
We all quest after
knowledge in our own way.

1:06:17.830 --> 1:06:18.957
- What do you think?

1:06:22.030 --> 1:06:23.360
- It's interesting.

1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:24.193
- Just wait.

1:06:25.860 --> 1:06:26.693
- Okay.

1:06:30.090 --> 1:06:32.510
- Uh, can I get you anything?

1:06:32.510 --> 1:06:34.990
Tea, whiskey, tea with whiskey?

1:06:34.990 --> 1:06:36.140
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

1:06:43.910 --> 1:06:45.283
Sydney.
- Yup, yeah, mm-hm.

1:07:10.577 --> 1:07:11.410
- Come in.

1:07:15.700 --> 1:07:16.643
Did you read it?

1:07:18.610 --> 1:07:19.840
- I did.

1:07:19.840 --> 1:07:20.673
- And?

1:07:31.270 --> 1:07:32.620
- Sydney, I can't use this.

1:07:35.240 --> 1:07:40.240
It's a new play.

1:07:40.450 --> 1:07:43.010
It's a different play.

1:07:43.010 --> 1:07:44.090
It's brilliant.

1:07:44.090 --> 1:07:47.660
And it's beautiful,
but it's not "Macbeth".

1:07:47.660 --> 1:07:49.910
- It's the heart of "Macbeth".

1:07:49.910 --> 1:07:51.770
- I don't disagree.

1:07:51.770 --> 1:07:54.093
I like letting him stew in his castle.

1:07:54.980 --> 1:07:56.770
I like hearing about the alliance

1:07:56.770 --> 1:07:59.666
between Macduff and Malcolm
instead of seeing it.

1:07:59.666 --> 1:08:03.850
I love watching Lady M unravel

1:08:03.850 --> 1:08:05.420
instead of just hearing about it.

1:08:05.420 --> 1:08:07.070
It's cleaner, it's tighter.

1:08:07.070 --> 1:08:12.070
It's more psychologically
intense, but it's not Shakespeare.

1:08:13.650 --> 1:08:15.892
Shakespeare jumps around.

1:08:15.892 --> 1:08:18.740
He shows us irrelevant things.

1:08:18.740 --> 1:08:22.080
He wants the stage to
be England and Scotland

1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:25.550
and the castle and the tavern
and Birnam Wood all at once.

1:08:25.550 --> 1:08:27.200
That's how this play works.

1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:29.263
It's a mess, but it's his mess.

1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:33.510
This is something new.

1:08:33.510 --> 1:08:36.720
- Maybe he's learned a
thing or two in 400 years.

1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:39.510
- You're still claiming
that Shakespeare wrote this?

1:08:39.510 --> 1:08:40.430
- Who else could?

1:08:40.430 --> 1:08:43.273
- Well, you.

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:50.640
- You think I wrote that?

1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:51.840
- You gave it to me.

1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:53.265
- So?

1:08:53.265 --> 1:08:54.880
- So you tell me.

1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:57.880
- Adam, I couldn't write that,
not in four million years.

1:08:57.880 --> 1:09:00.010
Could you?
- No, no I couldn't.

1:09:01.590 --> 1:09:02.490
But someone could.

1:09:03.630 --> 1:09:05.640
Shakespeare wasn't a God.

1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:07.370
We pretend that he was, but he wasn't.

1:09:07.370 --> 1:09:09.540
He was just a guy, a very talented guy,

1:09:09.540 --> 1:09:11.860
but there have always
been people like that.

1:09:11.860 --> 1:09:13.620
- Okay, so what's your theory?

1:09:13.620 --> 1:09:16.800
That I have a very
gifted playwright friend

1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:19.420
and we got together and
concocted this version

1:09:19.420 --> 1:09:22.170
and I have waited until
now to force it upon you?

1:09:22.170 --> 1:09:24.020
- I don't know, Sydney, I don't know.

1:09:25.090 --> 1:09:27.900
I was up half the night
reading this and rereading it.

1:09:27.900 --> 1:09:29.840
And it is great, it's completely great,

1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:33.040
but it is not the play
you signed up to do.

1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:35.190
We can't put this up
and call it "Macbeth".

1:09:35.190 --> 1:09:37.661
We'd be laughed at, we'd look like idiots.

1:09:37.661 --> 1:09:40.950
- Oh, well, there you go.

1:09:40.950 --> 1:09:41.990
- There I go what?

1:09:41.990 --> 1:09:43.980
- There you go, there's the real Adam.

1:09:43.980 --> 1:09:45.830
You don't care about this play.

1:09:45.830 --> 1:09:47.093
You just worry about
what people will think.

1:09:47.093 --> 1:09:48.400
- That is not fair.

1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:49.790
- No, which part is unfair?

1:09:49.790 --> 1:09:51.177
- I am doing my job here, Sydney.

1:09:51.177 --> 1:09:52.530
No, you're doing your career.

1:09:52.530 --> 1:09:53.840
- I am directing Shakespeare.

1:09:53.840 --> 1:09:54.870
- Sure, you are, of course you are.

1:09:54.870 --> 1:09:56.812
And who gives a damn
what Shakespeare thinks?

1:09:56.812 --> 1:09:58.300
- Well, that's what it really
comes down to, isn't it.

1:09:58.300 --> 1:09:59.990
So let's talk about that for a second.

1:09:59.990 --> 1:10:03.500
I don't believe for a second
that you met Shakespeare

1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:05.480
or that he gave you
these pages, and why not?

1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:08.003
Because I'm not insane, Sydney.

1:10:09.430 --> 1:10:11.420
And I don't think you are either.

1:10:11.420 --> 1:10:15.060
So what's going on?

1:10:15.060 --> 1:10:16.200
- I told you.

1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:18.763
- But you don't expect me
to actually believe it.

1:10:21.272 --> 1:10:22.105
Do you?

1:10:28.490 --> 1:10:29.323
- No.

1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:33.163
No, I guess not.

1:10:41.950 --> 1:10:43.503
Thank you for reading it.

1:10:55.610 --> 1:10:56.443
- I'm sorry.

1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:00.710
- Don't be sorry, Adam.

1:11:03.240 --> 1:11:04.157
Just get out.

1:11:28.959 --> 1:11:29.792
Damn it.

1:11:44.650 --> 1:11:46.450
- The costumes we pulled from the shop

1:11:46.450 --> 1:11:48.320
are downstairs getting ironed.

1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:49.950
Set building is underway.

1:11:49.950 --> 1:11:51.490
We'll try to keep the noise to a minimum.

1:11:51.490 --> 1:11:52.400
- That is great.

1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:53.770
And the stained glass come in?

1:11:53.770 --> 1:11:57.810
- Just now, the museum
wanted to remind us again

1:11:57.810 --> 1:12:01.240
how precious and fragile
and historic it is.

1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:03.900
- Aren't they the ones
who begged us to use it?

1:12:03.900 --> 1:12:05.113
- No comment.

1:12:06.010 --> 1:12:09.320
- You missed a pretty good
time last night, Adam.

1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:10.750
- I believe you.

1:12:10.750 --> 1:12:12.010
- Well, we're going out again tonight,

1:12:12.010 --> 1:12:13.770
if you're done with your reading.

1:12:13.770 --> 1:12:14.770
- Yeah, I'll prob...

1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:19.740
I'll be there.

1:12:19.740 --> 1:12:21.800
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:23.670
I'm allowed to have fun once in a while.

1:12:23.670 --> 1:12:25.830
- Actually, in your
contract, it says you're not.

1:12:25.830 --> 1:12:29.180
- Well, screw the contract.

1:12:29.180 --> 1:12:31.563
- I mean, okay, I warned you.

1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:38.370
- Okay, that's five minutes, everybody.

1:12:38.370 --> 1:12:39.203
Thank you.

1:12:39.203 --> 1:12:41.003
- I need a smoke, do you want one?

1:12:41.003 --> 1:12:42.680
- No, but I'll watch.

1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:45.220
- Oh, can you grab that plywood
and set up the prop table?

1:12:45.220 --> 1:12:46.600
- Yup.

1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:48.130
- Oh, and Jess is coming up in a second.

1:12:48.130 --> 1:12:49.980
She wants you to see her costume.

1:12:49.980 --> 1:12:50.820
- I've seen the photos.

1:12:50.820 --> 1:12:53.107
- She wants you to see it on her.

1:12:56.695 --> 1:12:59.543
- And I'm gonna need to see
the plan for the stage again.

1:12:59.543 --> 1:13:02.003
I'm worried about the
down stage playing area.

1:13:03.820 --> 1:13:05.160
Is the shop gonna hate me?

1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:06.940
- They already hate you.

1:13:06.940 --> 1:13:09.400
- I might as well get what I want.

1:13:09.400 --> 1:13:10.233
- Hey Adam.

1:13:13.900 --> 1:13:15.320
You don't like it.

1:13:15.320 --> 1:13:17.195
- You've just got, you've
got a little bit of um.

1:13:21.799 --> 1:13:24.350
You're bleeding a lot.
- Yeah, yeah.

1:13:24.350 --> 1:13:27.653
Your nose is.

1:13:28.780 --> 1:13:29.770
- Well, there goes that.

1:13:29.770 --> 1:13:31.360
Can I get a little help up here?

1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:32.393
- Jesus!

1:13:32.393 --> 1:13:34.140
- I mean whenever you--

1:13:34.140 --> 1:13:35.455
- Fire!

1:13:35.455 --> 1:13:37.513
Fire, fire, everybody out!

1:13:37.513 --> 1:13:40.921
- Shit, Adam, help me with this ladder!

1:13:40.921 --> 1:13:42.588
- What is happening?

1:13:45.190 --> 1:13:46.860
Well, the good news is

1:13:46.860 --> 1:13:48.533
the theater's still standing.

1:13:49.710 --> 1:13:51.030
- Are we all fired?

1:13:51.030 --> 1:13:52.143
- Not that I've heard.

1:13:54.020 --> 1:13:57.550
I spoke to the costume people.

1:13:57.550 --> 1:13:59.010
They're very sorry.

1:13:59.010 --> 1:14:00.690
One of the interns left an iron

1:14:00.690 --> 1:14:02.593
on some polyester pants.

1:14:03.960 --> 1:14:06.937
- Why do we have polyester
pants in "Macbeth"?

1:14:07.810 --> 1:14:09.724
- They don't look polyester.

1:14:09.724 --> 1:14:12.724
- They don't look like anything now.

1:14:14.404 --> 1:14:15.600
- You should get some rest.

1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:16.790
There's nothing more you can do today.

1:14:16.790 --> 1:14:19.750
- There must be someone left
I haven't apologized to.

1:14:19.750 --> 1:14:20.633
- Me, maybe.

1:14:21.870 --> 1:14:24.010
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

1:14:24.010 --> 1:14:24.843
- Whatever.

1:14:26.700 --> 1:14:27.920
- Get some sleep.

1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:29.093
Tomorrow's a new day.

1:14:30.089 --> 1:14:32.800
- If it's anything like
today, let's just skip it.

1:14:32.800 --> 1:14:33.790
- I'll make a note.

1:15:04.140 --> 1:15:05.960
- I know you're out here.

1:15:05.960 --> 1:15:07.920
Will Shakespeare!

1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:10.263
You come face me right now.

1:15:11.310 --> 1:15:15.020
- I hath espy some subtle tinge of wrath

1:15:15.020 --> 1:15:17.870
about the edges of thy beauty's glow.

1:15:17.870 --> 1:15:19.720
- I am not in the mood
for your shit right now.

1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:22.600
- And yet I know not
why, it is fine manure

1:15:22.600 --> 1:15:25.760
in which good players flourish admirably.

1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:26.990
- You lied to me.

1:15:26.990 --> 1:15:28.300
- I never in my life.

1:15:28.300 --> 1:15:30.100
- It's not the witch who cursed the play.

1:15:30.100 --> 1:15:31.017
It's you.

1:15:31.017 --> 1:15:33.300
- Why, with what power?

1:15:33.300 --> 1:15:36.210
I am mortal made and no more potent

1:15:36.210 --> 1:15:37.550
in such arts than you.

1:15:37.550 --> 1:15:39.250
- Don't play the innocent.

1:15:39.250 --> 1:15:42.190
You hate this play and
we won't let you fix it.

1:15:42.190 --> 1:15:45.140
So you throw a stupid
tantrum hoping to scare us.

1:15:45.140 --> 1:15:46.530
- You wrong me, lady.

1:15:46.530 --> 1:15:48.470
- It's so obvious.

1:15:48.470 --> 1:15:51.330
When I gave Adam your new
pages, you were pacified

1:15:51.330 --> 1:15:52.420
and we had a good day.

1:15:52.420 --> 1:15:54.890
Then when Adam said he wouldn't use them,

1:15:54.890 --> 1:15:56.730
that's when everything went cockeyed.

1:15:56.730 --> 1:15:58.100
You're the curse.

1:15:58.100 --> 1:16:01.610
- I have some magic, this I'll not deny.

1:16:01.610 --> 1:16:03.640
To be a ghost has compensations

1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:06.470
and I make with them what sport I may.

1:16:06.470 --> 1:16:09.930
Your friend, Hugh Painter,
you did call a knave.

1:16:09.930 --> 1:16:12.530
And I, the thinking me of this,

1:16:12.530 --> 1:16:17.530
did give him cause by dint of
some light warning to repent.

1:16:17.630 --> 1:16:19.090
- You almost killed him.

1:16:19.090 --> 1:16:20.270
- Nay, my aim was good.

1:16:20.270 --> 1:16:22.530
I meant to frighten him, and so I did.

1:16:22.530 --> 1:16:23.940
- You set the place on fire!

1:16:23.940 --> 1:16:24.973
- What could I do!

1:16:27.220 --> 1:16:31.520
This dwarf, ungainly tragedy
is a blot upon the canvas

1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:36.520
of my life's proud work and
men will still perform it.

1:16:37.270 --> 1:16:40.180
Hearing enduring echos on
the stages of the world

1:16:40.180 --> 1:16:45.180
with such a grinding music that
it keeps my soul from rest,

1:16:46.540 --> 1:16:48.770
from peace, from God himself.

1:16:48.770 --> 1:16:51.880
- You're such a moron,
it's a classic play.

1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:55.840
- 'Tis half of heaven, half of musty hell.

1:16:55.840 --> 1:16:58.710
Some speeches, I confess,
are definitely rot

1:16:58.710 --> 1:17:01.930
and all the nobler for their brevity.

1:17:01.930 --> 1:17:05.160
But other parts are
clumsy, bald and schooled

1:17:05.160 --> 1:17:08.500
as if some thick-thumbed
child roughed them out

1:17:08.500 --> 1:17:12.050
intending to return and make them shine,

1:17:12.050 --> 1:17:14.383
but soon forgetting as all children will.

1:17:16.740 --> 1:17:20.250
That child was I when
queuing out this work

1:17:20.250 --> 1:17:23.350
the time outpaced me and
all, hopefully, I made

1:17:23.350 --> 1:17:25.576
what best I could of it.

1:17:25.576 --> 1:17:28.750
And now I reap the poison
that my hands did so.

1:17:28.750 --> 1:17:31.883
What agonies in that few souls can know.

1:17:33.980 --> 1:17:35.610
- I'm sorry.

1:17:35.610 --> 1:17:38.200
I can see that would be hard.

1:17:38.200 --> 1:17:40.840
But your reaction isn't helping things.

1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:42.240
We're not your enemy.

1:17:42.240 --> 1:17:44.170
Call off the curse.

1:17:44.170 --> 1:17:48.683
It's making a bad situation worse.

1:17:50.150 --> 1:17:51.780
- I cannot do it.

1:17:51.780 --> 1:17:54.570
- Oh, you can and you will.

1:17:54.570 --> 1:17:57.923
- Nay, I will hold my
ground for good or ill.

1:17:59.702 --> 1:18:02.880
Nothing stand to lose by flouting you

1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:06.010
but your good graces
would you have withdrawn.

1:18:06.010 --> 1:18:09.060
What then remains for
you to threaten me with

1:18:09.060 --> 1:18:12.523
but futile anger lacking weight or pith.

1:18:14.130 --> 1:18:15.670
You're such a jackass.

1:18:15.670 --> 1:18:17.780
- That's as it may be.

1:18:17.780 --> 1:18:21.450
Thou must decide how best to deal with me.

1:18:21.450 --> 1:18:24.880
I am the wolf no longer held at bay.

1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:28.793
I will be fed one way or the other way.

1:18:36.210 --> 1:18:38.973
- All right, come on.

1:18:45.765 --> 1:18:46.598
Adam.
- Mm.

1:18:47.560 --> 1:18:48.810
Adam, wake up.

1:18:58.810 --> 1:19:00.120
- Am I dreaming?

1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:01.220
- You're not dreaming.

1:19:02.220 --> 1:19:04.193
There's someone I want you to meet.

1:19:11.393 --> 1:19:12.610
- Who the hell is this?

1:19:12.610 --> 1:19:16.830
- A man you know too
well and yet know not.

1:19:16.830 --> 1:19:20.710
An all neglected and all worshiped man,

1:19:20.710 --> 1:19:25.710
forgotten, famed, admired and
cast off, a walking paradox.

1:19:27.690 --> 1:19:28.873
Your servant, sir.

1:19:30.120 --> 1:19:31.400
- Holy shit!

1:19:31.400 --> 1:19:34.710
- Aye, there's another
worthy riddle, friend.

1:19:34.710 --> 1:19:37.350
Can dung be holy?

1:19:37.350 --> 1:19:38.380
I am proof it can.

1:19:38.380 --> 1:19:39.360
- It's you?

1:19:39.360 --> 1:19:40.660
- It is.

1:19:40.660 --> 1:19:41.610
- I'd know you anywhere.

1:19:41.610 --> 1:19:43.350
- And yet you knew me not

1:19:43.350 --> 1:19:45.360
when, through my friend, this worthy lady,

1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:49.420
I made bold to give some certain
hints how my unworthy play

1:19:49.420 --> 1:19:52.880
might rise to better notice in your care.

1:19:52.880 --> 1:19:53.713
- I'm sorry.

1:19:53.713 --> 1:19:55.030
- It is no matter, sir.

1:19:55.030 --> 1:19:58.260
You see me now and judge the weight of me.

1:19:58.260 --> 1:20:01.460
Have I such substance has may tempt you

1:20:01.460 --> 1:20:04.290
to accept my humble offering of words?

1:20:04.290 --> 1:20:05.250
- I'm at your service.

1:20:05.250 --> 1:20:07.040
- No, marry no such thing.

1:20:07.040 --> 1:20:10.000
Let's rather say we both serve in our turn

1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:13.720
that rough and tameless
God that rules the stage

1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:16.200
and makes our words as lightning steps,

1:20:16.200 --> 1:20:20.730
as thunderclaps when we are
brave enough to tread his boat.

1:20:20.730 --> 1:20:22.460
- I'm at his service!

1:20:22.460 --> 1:20:23.620
- Then it is done.

1:20:23.620 --> 1:20:26.730
- Your work must finish
what I've scarce begun.

1:20:26.730 --> 1:20:29.790
A play's a slack, unblooded, arid thing

1:20:29.790 --> 1:20:33.750
until the players make
it breathe and sing.

1:20:33.750 --> 1:20:34.980
I wrote the words.

1:20:34.980 --> 1:20:38.600
Now, you must write the
life that warms the watcher

1:20:38.600 --> 1:20:40.900
like a winter's wife.

1:20:40.900 --> 1:20:45.200
I leave this task in your most
able hands and quit you now

1:20:45.200 --> 1:20:47.593
for colder, darker lands.

1:20:50.660 --> 1:20:53.883
And now, fair Sydney,
know this well of me,

1:20:54.871 --> 1:20:58.220
no mischief have I ever rot on thee.

1:21:08.587 --> 1:21:09.420
- That.

1:21:10.802 --> 1:21:12.208
That, that.

1:21:12.208 --> 1:21:13.041
- Yes.

1:21:14.122 --> 1:21:14.955
Yes!

1:21:21.930 --> 1:21:23.430
- I am sorry.

1:21:23.430 --> 1:21:24.783
- I'm sorry too.

1:21:26.690 --> 1:21:29.890
What do you think we should do?

1:21:29.890 --> 1:21:31.723
I think we have to put it to a vote.

1:21:36.320 --> 1:21:39.110
- This and what needful else

1:21:39.110 --> 1:21:41.610
that calls upon us by the grace of grace,

1:21:41.610 --> 1:21:45.240
we will perform in measure time and place.

1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:49.590
So thanks to all at once and
to each one whom we invite

1:21:49.590 --> 1:21:50.940
to see us crowned at Scone.

1:21:52.010 --> 1:21:54.910
- Exit all, followed
by the ghost of Duncan,

1:21:54.910 --> 1:21:57.363
ghost of Macbeth left alone onstage.

1:21:58.310 --> 1:22:00.420
- And Duncan with them,

1:22:00.420 --> 1:22:04.003
with as proud a grace as ever
in his regal life he showed.

1:22:04.980 --> 1:22:08.920
His issue triumphs and my barren
seeds sticks in the ground

1:22:08.920 --> 1:22:12.383
like rocks that clip the
plow and comes to nothing.

1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:18.020
I dearly hoped that
death might be an ending

1:22:18.020 --> 1:22:20.790
but I see such bitter
reaches of eternity stretch

1:22:20.790 --> 1:22:24.650
out before me that I
have repent that murder

1:22:24.650 --> 1:22:27.173
on which all my hopes were spent.

1:22:28.800 --> 1:22:29.793
No more of this.

1:22:31.290 --> 1:22:33.670
What's done is all behind.

1:22:33.670 --> 1:22:36.240
I'll lay the yolk on my unquiet mind

1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:39.380
and in this Earth, I'll
cultivate the scene

1:22:39.380 --> 1:22:42.423
of what undreamt of
glories might have been.

1:22:43.500 --> 1:22:45.883
If you would profit by my woeful tale,

1:22:46.840 --> 1:22:51.840
think what a crime it
is to strive and fail.

1:22:53.010 --> 1:22:55.883
- Exit Macbeth, end of play.

1:23:01.840 --> 1:23:02.793
- Who wrote this?

1:23:04.720 --> 1:23:06.993
- Just some guy.

1:23:08.910 --> 1:23:10.610
- It's very different.

1:23:10.610 --> 1:23:11.920
- It is, yeah.

1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:15.140
- It's got a lot more of
me in it, which I like,

1:23:15.140 --> 1:23:16.790
more of Sydney, which I like too.

1:23:17.701 --> 1:23:19.543
- But what about narratively?

1:23:20.380 --> 1:23:21.820
Does it work for you?

1:23:21.820 --> 1:23:22.830
- Yeah, it works.

1:23:22.830 --> 1:23:24.010
Yeah, it works.

1:23:24.010 --> 1:23:25.223
It's a different story.

1:23:26.070 --> 1:23:27.980
- Better story, worse story?

1:23:27.980 --> 1:23:30.343
- Well, like I say, there's more of me.

1:23:33.380 --> 1:23:36.740
- I mean, Hugh's addressing
the elephant in the room.

1:23:36.740 --> 1:23:39.030
My part is a lot smaller, so is Sean's.

1:23:39.030 --> 1:23:41.270
It's hard for us to be objective.

1:23:41.270 --> 1:23:44.450
I mean, we can try, but it's asking a lot.

1:23:44.450 --> 1:23:48.090
- I know, and I don't like
putting you in this position

1:23:50.410 --> 1:23:51.243
but the truth,

1:23:53.650 --> 1:23:54.483
the truth,

1:23:56.100 --> 1:23:57.313
the truth is, um.

1:24:01.330 --> 1:24:02.497
Sydney, you say it.

1:24:10.550 --> 1:24:14.933
- It was given to us by the
ghost of William Shakespeare.

1:24:19.800 --> 1:24:23.133
- Well, that does change things.

1:24:26.490 --> 1:24:27.840
- This is a prank, right?

1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:31.420
This is like the guy with the
hood and the spooky voice.

1:24:31.420 --> 1:24:32.253
This is a joke.

1:24:32.253 --> 1:24:33.086
- It's not a joke.

1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:36.453
- You saw a ghost?

1:24:37.300 --> 1:24:38.133
- Yeah.

1:24:40.814 --> 1:24:41.964
- You both saw a ghost?

1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:47.193
- We did.

1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:53.900
- All right, screw it, I'm in.

1:24:56.500 --> 1:24:57.333
- Hugh?

1:24:59.980 --> 1:25:01.913
- I live in service to the theater.

1:25:06.006 --> 1:25:06.839
- Yeah.

1:25:20.110 --> 1:25:21.390
- I'm voting no

1:25:21.390 --> 1:25:23.450
because it's a whole new script

1:25:23.450 --> 1:25:26.510
and it's going to be
a logistical nightmare

1:25:26.510 --> 1:25:28.393
from every possible point of view.

1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:33.063
Anyone else want to voice an opinion?

1:25:37.340 --> 1:25:40.030
All right, let's break for lunch.

1:25:40.030 --> 1:25:42.030
Back in two hours with a whole new play.

1:25:47.530 --> 1:25:49.003
- Hey, Lauren!

1:25:51.270 --> 1:25:52.530
I'm sorry.

1:25:52.530 --> 1:25:54.100
- Are you kidding?

1:25:54.100 --> 1:25:56.963
I live for shit shows like this.

1:26:17.836 --> 1:26:19.990
- You need something, Hugh?

1:26:19.990 --> 1:26:21.960
- You do realize, of course,

1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:25.943
that if all this goes
pear-shaped, it'll be on you.

1:26:27.010 --> 1:26:30.393
The brash, young director who
spat on Shakespeare's grave.

1:26:32.102 --> 1:26:34.170
- I kind of like that, actually.

1:26:34.170 --> 1:26:35.003
- I do too.

1:26:37.630 --> 1:26:38.463
Boy!

1:26:40.180 --> 1:26:42.063
Take a deep breath, fearless leader,

1:26:44.370 --> 1:26:46.933
the storm is about to begin.

1:27:15.270 --> 1:27:16.860
- It's a good house.

1:27:16.860 --> 1:27:18.010
It's packed.

1:27:18.010 --> 1:27:19.913
- Opening night, it should be.

1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:21.833
- You okay?

1:27:22.869 --> 1:27:23.702
- Ah yeah.

1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:26.630
Go break a leg.

1:27:26.630 --> 1:27:27.992
- You too.

1:27:27.992 --> 1:27:28.992
- All right.

1:27:34.630 --> 1:27:36.283
- Okay, house to black please.

1:27:37.610 --> 1:27:39.840
Ready Q2, ready sound QA.

1:27:39.840 --> 1:27:41.206
Both on my mark.

1:27:41.206 --> 1:27:42.710
Standing by.

1:27:42.710 --> 1:27:44.853
- Go.

1:27:45.950 --> 1:27:47.437
And we're off.

1:27:49.430 --> 1:27:52.220
- Great Glamis, worthy Cawdor!

1:27:52.220 --> 1:27:55.600
Greater than both, by
the all-hail hereafter!

1:27:55.600 --> 1:27:57.057
Thy letters have transported me

1:27:57.057 --> 1:27:59.010
beyond this ignorant present,

1:27:59.010 --> 1:28:03.150
and I feel now the future in the instant.

1:28:03.150 --> 1:28:07.303
- My dearest love, Duncan
comes here tonight.

1:28:08.270 --> 1:28:09.610
- And when goes hence?

1:28:09.610 --> 1:28:12.280
- Tomorrow, as he purposes.

1:28:12.280 --> 1:28:15.293
- O, never shall sun that morrow see!

1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:19.670
Your face, my thane,
is as a book where men

1:28:19.670 --> 1:28:22.760
may read strange matters
to beguile the time,

1:28:22.760 --> 1:28:24.660
look like the time.

1:28:24.660 --> 1:28:26.250
Bear welcome in your eye,

1:28:26.250 --> 1:28:28.543
your hand, your tongue,

1:28:31.870 --> 1:28:33.300
look like the innocent flower,

1:28:33.300 --> 1:28:35.043
but be the serpent under it.

1:28:36.340 --> 1:28:38.197
He that's coming must be provided for

1:28:38.197 --> 1:28:40.260
and you shall put this
night's great business

1:28:40.260 --> 1:28:44.480
into my dispatch which shall
to all our nights and days

1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:48.903
to come give solely
sovereign sway and masterdom.

1:28:50.090 --> 1:28:52.063
- We will speak further.

1:28:55.130 --> 1:28:56.763
- Only look up clear.

1:28:57.690 --> 1:29:00.523
To alter favor ever is to fear.

1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:04.723
Leave all the rest to me.

1:29:10.730 --> 1:29:11.813
- Ready, Q43.

1:29:13.020 --> 1:29:13.853
Go.

1:29:15.116 --> 1:29:18.900
- Thy dreams, my dearest,
are much wondered at.

1:29:20.660 --> 1:29:22.630
- Do servants gossip?

1:29:22.630 --> 1:29:24.033
You amaze me, sir.

1:29:25.010 --> 1:29:30.010
- Nay, I confess my own
heart slips to doubt

1:29:30.080 --> 1:29:32.460
when I do hear thy wanderings at night

1:29:32.460 --> 1:29:34.900
and how thy speech does
wonder with thy feet.

1:29:34.900 --> 1:29:37.370
- My tongue and feet
shall do as pleases them

1:29:37.370 --> 1:29:39.970
and thou must keep a
better watch on thine.

1:29:39.970 --> 1:29:42.363
- I don't remember this part.

1:29:44.700 --> 1:29:47.500
- Cannot we speak of
what our hearts do know.

1:29:47.500 --> 1:29:48.550
I know what ails you.

1:29:49.790 --> 1:29:51.390
I felt it too.

1:29:51.390 --> 1:29:54.820
Yet guilt is nothing,
mark me well in that.

1:29:54.820 --> 1:29:57.190
It is a demon sent to harry thee by gods

1:29:57.190 --> 1:29:59.320
of envy coveting thy state.

1:29:59.320 --> 1:30:01.900
It is a pale and vanishing conceit

1:30:01.900 --> 1:30:03.650
built of a thousand nothings

1:30:03.650 --> 1:30:07.183
and dispelled the minute
it is boldly looked upon.

1:30:08.490 --> 1:30:11.190
From thee I had this moral.

1:30:11.190 --> 1:30:13.740
Now let me, that was my student.

1:30:13.740 --> 1:30:15.813
- Don't touch with thy filth!

1:30:16.650 --> 1:30:19.970
The bloody-dripping and blaspheming man.

1:30:19.970 --> 1:30:22.580
Thy boots awash with ruby-seeming blood

1:30:22.580 --> 1:30:25.040
make of my carpet a red patched rag.

1:30:25.040 --> 1:30:28.880
Thy face is not the face I doted on,

1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:32.500
but leaks mute rivers of accusing stain

1:30:32.500 --> 1:30:36.840
and thou art not my
husband, but a fiend fierce

1:30:36.840 --> 1:30:41.043
and tormenting and claiming me for health.

1:30:45.400 --> 1:30:47.560
- This madness is too
near the truth of things

1:30:47.560 --> 1:30:48.913
which men may guess.

1:30:50.150 --> 1:30:52.513
Her dream disaster brings.

1:30:53.560 --> 1:30:56.820
Yet such defiance in the teeth of fate

1:30:56.820 --> 1:31:01.543
fills full my heart with
love to match her hate.

1:31:03.840 --> 1:31:04.673
- Plays.

1:31:06.090 --> 1:31:06.923
Plays.

1:31:06.923 --> 1:31:08.940
God save the mark, it plays.

1:31:08.940 --> 1:31:10.690
- Sorry, who are you?

1:31:11.750 --> 1:31:13.820
- One William Shakespeare.

1:31:13.820 --> 1:31:16.190
- Oh, I love your work.

1:31:16.190 --> 1:31:17.490
- I humbly thank you.

1:31:17.490 --> 1:31:19.514
- Stay out of the way.

1:31:25.319 --> 1:31:27.902
Hail, King of Scotland.

1:31:43.410 --> 1:31:45.660
- We shall not spend a
large expense of time

1:31:45.660 --> 1:31:48.420
before we reckon with your several loves

1:31:48.420 --> 1:31:49.823
and make us even with you.

1:31:51.920 --> 1:31:56.110
What is more, we'll ferret
out the cruel ministers

1:31:56.110 --> 1:31:59.220
of this dead butcher and
his fiend like queen.

1:31:59.220 --> 1:32:01.270
This, and what needful else

1:32:01.270 --> 1:32:03.440
that calls upon us by the grace of grace,

1:32:03.440 --> 1:32:07.550
we will perform in measure time and place.

1:32:07.550 --> 1:32:10.330
So thanks to all at once

1:32:11.650 --> 1:32:16.453
and to each one whom we invite
to see us crowned at Scone.

1:32:28.770 --> 1:32:33.770
- And Duncan with them, with
as proud a grace as ever

1:32:34.020 --> 1:32:36.113
in his regal life he's shown.

1:32:37.650 --> 1:32:39.313
His issue triumphs.

1:32:40.210 --> 1:32:44.270
And my barren seed sticks
in the ground like rocks

1:32:44.270 --> 1:32:47.583
that clipped the plow
and comes to nothing.

1:32:50.220 --> 1:32:53.303
I dearly hoped that
death might be an ending,

1:32:54.260 --> 1:32:58.240
but I see such bitter reaches
of eternity stretch out

1:32:58.240 --> 1:33:02.470
before me that I hath repent that murder

1:33:02.470 --> 1:33:04.583
on which all my hopes were spent.

1:33:06.440 --> 1:33:07.373
No more of this.

1:33:09.650 --> 1:33:10.950
What's done is all behind.

1:33:12.940 --> 1:33:15.670
I'll lay the yolk on my unquiet mind.

1:33:15.670 --> 1:33:19.720
And in this dirt, I'll cultivate the scene

1:33:19.720 --> 1:33:23.033
of what undreamt of glories might've been.

1:33:24.160 --> 1:33:26.643
If you would profit by my woeful tale,

1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:32.673
think what a crime it
is to strive and fail.

1:34:19.220 --> 1:34:21.303
- That was not "Macbeth".

1:34:22.950 --> 1:34:24.200
- I know.

1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:25.240
Sorry.

1:34:25.240 --> 1:34:26.113
- Don't be sorry.

1:34:27.118 --> 1:34:29.243
I loved it.

1:34:38.851 --> 1:34:40.851
- So what did you think?

1:34:45.380 --> 1:34:47.908
Yeah, that was weird.

1:35:04.510 --> 1:35:06.270
- To William Shakespeare.

1:35:06.270 --> 1:35:10.310
To William Shakespeare.

1:35:10.310 --> 1:35:12.200
- Where is the bastard anyway?

1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:14.550
- No idea, I haven't
seen him in over a week.

1:35:14.550 --> 1:35:17.750
- Lauren said she saw him backstage

1:35:17.750 --> 1:35:19.350
and he seemed very happy.

1:35:19.350 --> 1:35:20.560
- Where is Lauren?

1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:22.110
- She went to bed hours ago.

1:35:22.110 --> 1:35:23.930
- Oh God, I hate responsible people.

1:35:23.930 --> 1:35:24.813
- Yeah.
- Mm-mm.

1:35:25.980 --> 1:35:29.470
- Well, I'm tired of waiting
for the dead white male.

1:35:29.470 --> 1:35:31.847
If he shows up, tell him
I'm grateful, et cetera.

1:35:31.847 --> 1:35:33.920
- You're the soul of poetry, you.

1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:35.453
- Oh, bite me.

1:35:41.870 --> 1:35:43.470
- I think I'm gonna head in too.

1:35:45.540 --> 1:35:46.373
Muah.

1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:51.543
Congratulations.

1:35:52.524 --> 1:35:53.941
You too.

1:35:55.588 --> 1:35:57.338
- You were wonderful tonight, Jess.

1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:01.030
- Yeah, you too, Syd.

1:36:02.245 --> 1:36:03.100
I'll see you in the morning.

1:36:03.100 --> 1:36:05.150
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1:36:14.566 --> 1:36:17.524
- You know you really
missed the boat on that one.

1:36:17.524 --> 1:36:19.924
- I actually think they're
a much better couple.

1:36:21.270 --> 1:36:22.617
- You may be right.

1:36:24.970 --> 1:36:26.670
- I think we're gonna turn in too.

1:36:27.710 --> 1:36:30.100
Goodnight, you crazy kids.

1:36:30.100 --> 1:36:31.273
Don't stay up out late.

1:36:33.080 --> 1:36:33.920
- Hey, Lucas.

1:36:33.920 --> 1:36:34.753
Yeah.

1:36:35.700 --> 1:36:39.380
- Thank you, taking a chance on this.

1:36:39.380 --> 1:36:42.190
I think your vote really
made the difference.

1:36:42.190 --> 1:36:43.601
- Huh.

1:36:43.601 --> 1:36:45.460
- It's a crazy thing we did.

1:36:45.460 --> 1:36:47.863
- Yeah, well, it's kinda why I liked it.

1:36:49.020 --> 1:36:52.603
Hey, next time, though, I'm Macbeth.

1:36:53.670 --> 1:36:54.920
- It's a promise.

1:36:54.920 --> 1:36:56.110
- Good enough, goodnight.

1:36:56.110 --> 1:36:56.943
- Good night, Lucas, goodnight, Sean.

1:36:56.943 --> 1:36:58.510
- Goodnight, Sean.
- Goodnight.

1:37:04.460 --> 1:37:05.700
- Are they?

1:37:05.700 --> 1:37:06.533
- Oh yeah.

1:37:07.720 --> 1:37:08.553
- Wow, I,

1:37:11.810 --> 1:37:13.320
I had no idea.

1:37:13.320 --> 1:37:14.373
- Seriously?

1:37:15.670 --> 1:37:16.503
- Am I an idiot?

1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:19.333
- I guess you must be.

1:37:24.620 --> 1:37:26.393
So you're heading out tomorrow?

1:37:28.490 --> 1:37:31.670
- I have to, my agent
set up 10,000 meetings

1:37:31.670 --> 1:37:33.450
for me in the city.

1:37:33.450 --> 1:37:36.180
- Well, I'm glad to know
that our little sacrilege

1:37:36.180 --> 1:37:38.410
hasn't killed you career.

1:37:38.410 --> 1:37:39.460
- There's still time.

1:37:42.150 --> 1:37:44.180
- We'll miss you up here.

1:37:44.180 --> 1:37:46.260
- I'll be back in a week or two

1:37:46.260 --> 1:37:47.760
to see how everything's going.

1:37:50.031 --> 1:37:51.070
You guys don't need me, though.

1:37:51.070 --> 1:37:52.020
It's your play now.

1:37:54.010 --> 1:37:54.960
- It's Will's play.

1:37:57.190 --> 1:37:58.023
- Yeah.

1:38:03.510 --> 1:38:06.250
I should get some shut-eye, I guess.

1:38:06.250 --> 1:38:08.483
- Yeah, yeah, yep, good idea.

1:38:12.840 --> 1:38:13.840
- You'll walk me in?

1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:17.373
- No, I think I'm gonna linger.

1:38:18.310 --> 1:38:19.210
It's a nice night.

1:38:21.740 --> 1:38:22.640
- Congratulations.

1:38:23.750 --> 1:38:24.583
- You too, boss.

1:38:25.603 --> 1:38:26.436
- Hmm.

1:38:54.044 --> 1:38:55.194
- I thought you'd gone.

1:38:56.260 --> 1:38:57.890
- So too did I.

1:38:59.423 --> 1:39:02.830
And yet I linger, what makes thou of that?

1:39:02.830 --> 1:39:06.643
Some weighty business
binds me to this place,

1:39:06.643 --> 1:39:11.110
but what its substance is, I cannot guess.

1:39:11.110 --> 1:39:13.363
- Thou mockest me.

1:39:13.363 --> 1:39:17.570
- I faith, I do, but with as kind a heart

1:39:17.570 --> 1:39:20.240
as generous a tongue has ever youth

1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:22.423
did mock his scented bride.

1:39:23.570 --> 1:39:26.163
I know my business well and servest thou.

1:39:27.330 --> 1:39:30.313
I speak of Adam and thou knowest why.

1:39:32.150 --> 1:39:33.430
- He is too young.

1:39:33.430 --> 1:39:35.270
- Why age must temper him

1:39:35.270 --> 1:39:38.730
and thou his tutor gave
what help thou canst.

1:39:38.730 --> 1:39:39.970
- I am too old.

1:39:39.970 --> 1:39:41.810
- In no particular.

1:39:41.810 --> 1:39:44.440
Are thee young in mind and zest of spirit

1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:49.260
and in grace of faith, thou
has a raft of qualities

1:39:49.260 --> 1:39:52.313
that many maids of 20 dearly crave.

1:39:54.690 --> 1:39:57.090
Thy arguments, thus far,
have gone for nought,

1:39:57.090 --> 1:39:58.983
my reasons swiftly cancels them.

1:40:00.483 --> 1:40:01.950
Look, try again.

1:40:01.950 --> 1:40:03.230
- He leaves tomorrow.

1:40:03.230 --> 1:40:05.200
- Then remains tonight.

1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:08.330
And in that darkling and abandoned wild

1:40:08.330 --> 1:40:11.000
with one half light and
other men have wrought

1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.580
much wilder things than this.

1:40:13.580 --> 1:40:16.000
Seize the night.

1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.380
The day will dawn too
late and seizing that

1:40:18.380 --> 1:40:20.000
will gain you only ashes.

1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.150
Act and win.

1:40:22.150 --> 1:40:24.560
- Thou art full of mischief.

1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:28.903
- I am full of truth.

1:40:30.500 --> 1:40:33.123
I'm too near death to
waste my time or thine.

1:40:35.050 --> 1:40:37.580
Already, I can hear it calling me,

1:40:37.580 --> 1:40:40.630
that blank hereafter into which I gazed,

1:40:40.630 --> 1:40:43.503
but many and many a time it was outside.

1:40:45.330 --> 1:40:48.910
I'll see it now if there be ought to see.

1:40:48.910 --> 1:40:53.910
If all is darkness,
that's a kind of peace.

1:40:56.570 --> 1:41:01.010
I am not weary, yet I feel my time

1:41:01.010 --> 1:41:03.843
slip through the slender of the hourglass.

1:41:05.900 --> 1:41:08.763
Grant me this boon before I go to rest.

1:41:10.147 --> 1:41:13.913
And promise me to love that foolish man.

1:41:15.700 --> 1:41:19.420
- I'll crave one moment
of your time of that.

1:41:19.420 --> 1:41:21.710
- Then speak with purpose.

1:41:21.710 --> 1:41:23.303
I am half away.

1:41:26.300 --> 1:41:29.063
- 'Tis poor to thank
what cannot be repaid.

1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:35.050
A rich gift handed down the
centuries, reviving to the soul,

1:41:35.050 --> 1:41:40.050
sweet on the tongue, 10,000
stages gracing with its grace.

1:41:40.570 --> 1:41:43.637
Thy words, thy all beguiling words,

1:41:47.060 --> 1:41:51.463
divine and human and immortal words,

1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:57.273
what poet does not till
the ground you sowed?

1:41:58.350 --> 1:42:01.643
What player does not flourish in thy soil?

1:42:02.740 --> 1:42:05.980
What person, lettered or unlettered,

1:42:05.980 --> 1:42:10.033
can, with reason, claim he
rests not in your shade?

1:42:11.770 --> 1:42:15.550
This English, that my
mind and heart revere,

1:42:15.550 --> 1:42:19.890
this gnarled, beautiful and bastard tongue

1:42:19.890 --> 1:42:22.620
flows through thee like
a river through a sieve

1:42:22.620 --> 1:42:27.093
emerging swift and
grateful, cold and clean.

1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:34.800
What thanks, why any thanks would pale.

1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:38.113
Yet hear my gratitude, it sings in me.

1:42:44.193 --> 1:42:46.183
- 'Tis well, 'tis welcome.

1:42:49.530 --> 1:42:51.243
'Tis most ably said.

1:42:52.856 --> 1:42:55.830
- I had a bit of help there from a knave.

1:42:55.830 --> 1:42:59.693
- A knave may have his uses, mark ye that.

1:42:59.693 --> 1:43:01.560
- I mark it well.

1:43:01.560 --> 1:43:03.740
Thou art thyself a knave.

1:43:03.740 --> 1:43:05.943
And thou has had thy uses.

1:43:07.248 --> 1:43:08.081
Now, be gone.

1:43:10.060 --> 1:43:12.777
This time is our time
now, for good or ill.

1:43:13.719 --> 1:43:17.080
And thou must haunt it
only with thy plays.

1:43:17.080 --> 1:43:18.996
- That suits me well.

1:43:18.996 --> 1:43:21.050
And yet there's one thing more.

1:43:21.050 --> 1:43:22.270
- What thing is that?

1:43:22.270 --> 1:43:23.570
- Why this unworthy thing.

1:43:37.548 --> 1:43:40.965
Now come what may to thee in later times,

1:43:42.136 --> 1:43:44.523
thou art the last to have a kiss from me.

1:43:46.110 --> 1:43:47.263
Keep well this secret.

1:43:48.420 --> 1:43:50.120
Clasp it to your heart.

1:43:52.074 --> 1:43:55.780
in thee.

1:43:55.780 --> 1:43:57.290
- You arrogant bastard.

1:43:57.290 --> 1:43:58.597
- So I am.

1:43:58.597 --> 1:44:01.393
But what man living has more cause than I?

1:44:03.550 --> 1:44:05.223
Think kindly on me, Sydney.

1:44:06.680 --> 1:44:11.680
I am dead and dead men
have no life but in report.

1:44:14.380 --> 1:44:17.250
- I'll think on thee as
I may choose to think.

1:44:17.250 --> 1:44:18.400
- I'll not begrudge it.

1:44:19.380 --> 1:44:21.290
To be in my thoughts in anyways

1:44:21.290 --> 1:44:23.510
is all the thanks I crave.

1:44:23.510 --> 1:44:26.700
- Go to, go to, thou
great unceasing mouth.

1:44:26.700 --> 1:44:30.053
- I'll cease upon an instant like all men.

1:44:30.970 --> 1:44:33.643
And when once gone, I'll not return again.

1:44:34.920 --> 1:44:36.097
- I'll miss thee, Will.

1:44:36.097 --> 1:44:39.970
- And I shall dream of
you as all men ought to

1:44:39.970 --> 1:44:42.353
and as many do.

1:44:43.480 --> 1:44:45.793
One couplet more and
then I'll say goodnight.

1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:51.213
Make what frail joy thou
canst in thy brief light.

1:44:52.810 --> 1:44:53.643
- I will.

1:44:55.440 --> 1:44:56.273
I will.

1:44:57.872 --> 1:44:59.833
Farewell, my sweetest Will.

1:45:01.020 --> 1:45:05.053
Thou has done mischief,
but more good than ill.

1:45:47.230 --> 1:45:50.780
- You're the most predictable
man I've ever met.

1:45:50.780 --> 1:45:52.840
- I'll take any superlative.

1:45:52.840 --> 1:45:53.673
- Good call.

1:45:55.777 --> 1:45:56.827
What are you reading?

1:45:58.140 --> 1:46:01.620
- Agricultural Practice
in Early New England.

1:46:01.620 --> 1:46:02.550
- How is it?

1:46:02.550 --> 1:46:04.350
- It's better than you would expect.

1:46:10.460 --> 1:46:12.370
Looks like we're the last ones up.

1:46:12.370 --> 1:46:14.783
- Looks like it, yup.

1:46:18.150 --> 1:46:19.560
- So?

1:46:19.560 --> 1:46:20.423
- So.

1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:25.460
I'm 44.

1:46:25.460 --> 1:46:26.760
- I'm 32.

1:46:26.760 --> 1:46:27.593
- You're young.

1:46:27.593 --> 1:46:28.426
- You're gorgeous.

1:46:28.426 --> 1:46:29.259
- Don't change the subject.

1:46:29.259 --> 1:46:30.092
- I wasn't.

1:46:35.950 --> 1:46:37.050
- You want a nightcap?

1:46:38.440 --> 1:46:40.973
I got a decent bottle
of scotch in my room.

1:46:43.670 --> 1:46:45.970
- Don't you think it's sketchy

1:46:45.970 --> 1:46:49.925
when directors hit on their actresses?

1:46:49.925 --> 1:46:51.380
- I do.

1:46:51.380 --> 1:46:53.950
But I'm not your director anymore.

1:46:53.950 --> 1:46:54.783
- Oh.

1:46:55.900 --> 1:46:57.803
- Plus I think you are amazing,

1:47:00.500 --> 1:47:02.853
which kind of negates the sketchiness.

1:47:03.730 --> 1:47:05.850
- That sounds like whiskey logic.

1:47:05.850 --> 1:47:06.683
- I've had like

1:47:10.010 --> 1:47:10.903
five.

1:47:12.370 --> 1:47:13.203
- Oh.

1:47:20.060 --> 1:47:20.893
I tell you what.

1:47:23.300 --> 1:47:25.100
You're coming back up here, in what,

1:47:26.778 --> 1:47:28.230
a week or two?

1:47:28.230 --> 1:47:29.330
- Something like that.

1:47:32.328 --> 1:47:33.161
- Buy me dinner?

1:47:35.100 --> 1:47:36.120
- That sounds nice.

1:48:09.973 --> 1:48:13.328
- Good night, Adam.

1:48:13.328 --> 1:48:14.411
- Good night.

1:51:13.651 --> 1:51:18.651
and a stupid grin

1:51:19.614 --> 1:51:24.614
which shoes to fit in
