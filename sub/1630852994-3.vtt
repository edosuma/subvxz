00:14.681 --> 00:16.641
I'm Jimmy DiResta, and I'm a maker.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.436
That's a hip way of saying
I make things… like this.

00:19.519 --> 00:20.520
Pretty cool, right?

00:21.229 --> 00:22.105
Walk with me.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.442
For years, I made my name
as a toy designer in New York City.

00:25.525 --> 00:29.446
Then I realized I don't like the city,
I don't like designing toys,

00:29.529 --> 00:32.240
and to be honest with you,
I don't really like kids.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.867
It's not like I hate them or anything.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.494
It's just it's,
"Check out my little Timmy."

00:36.578 --> 00:37.412
I don't care.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.039
Look at my birds.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.751
So anyway, I quit my job,

00:42.834 --> 00:46.212
I left the city,
and I moved upstate to here, my farm.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.673
I got land, I got animals,

00:49.340 --> 00:51.468
and best of all, I have this!

00:51.551 --> 00:53.970
The ultimate maker workshop!

00:54.471 --> 00:58.892
Inside, I have every kind of tool
and machine imaginable to make things.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.644
Pretty impressive stuff, huh?

01:02.896 --> 01:06.274
Really? You're labeling the table
like that's some sort of impres--

01:06.357 --> 01:07.859
"Bag"? We can just--

01:07.942 --> 01:10.361
Okay. Graphics guy trying to be funny.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.781
Can we please get on with it? Anyway…

01:12.864 --> 01:15.867
So I got a call to be on a TV show
because I'm a maker celebrity or whatever.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.161
I said, "Sure. Cool." Why not, right?

01:18.244 --> 01:19.370
So I agreed.

01:19.954 --> 01:21.956
Then I found out who I'd be working for.

01:22.040 --> 01:22.957
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:23.041 --> 01:24.375
<i>-Hi.</i>
<i>-Hi!</i>

01:24.459 --> 01:25.376
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:25.460 --> 01:26.294
<i>Hey, Jimmy.</i>

01:26.377 --> 01:27.504
What do you want?

01:27.587 --> 01:29.380
<i>Okay, Mr. Grouch.</i>

01:30.590 --> 01:35.053
Thirty years of expert build experience,
and I'm taking orders from half-pints.

01:35.136 --> 01:38.473
Because misery loves company,
I brought my buddies in on it with me.

01:38.556 --> 01:39.474
Say hi, guys.

01:39.557 --> 01:40.391
-Howdy!
-Hello!

01:40.475 --> 01:43.478
That's Jackman.
He's an engineer, and he plans everything.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.688
It's really annoying, but he's good at it.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.690
That's Derek, my best friend.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.443
Big guy and even bigger softie.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.403
This is Graz.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.447
Good maker, bad jokes.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.782
And Canadian Pat.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.369
Well, your guess is as good as mine.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.453
Let's have some fun.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.501
Together, we'll take pitches on this.

02:06.584 --> 02:09.170
Listen to whatever
their dumb little brains come up with.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.422
<i>The Pig Tripper. It trips the pig.</i>

02:11.506 --> 02:14.175
-Wow.
So a catapult that throws cat poop?

02:14.259 --> 02:16.052
-<i>Yes.</i>

02:16.136 --> 02:19.222
If it's interesting or doable,
I'll build it. If not--

02:19.305 --> 02:20.265
Next!

02:20.348 --> 02:21.516
-Next!
<i>-No way.</i>

02:21.599 --> 02:23.143
-Next!
<i>-Shut up!</i>

02:23.226 --> 02:24.936
-Some builds will be good.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.855
Dino Taco Toilet.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.439
Are you not entertained?

02:28.523 --> 02:30.108
Some builds will be bad.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.443
Graz, I told you
the scissors were gonna be too heavy!

02:32.527 --> 02:33.570
Make a bigger handle!

02:33.653 --> 02:35.697
But all of them
will be absolutely pointless.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.907
-Yeah!
<i>-That is disgusting!</i>

02:39.159 --> 02:40.827
Whoa!

02:41.411 --> 02:44.622
<i>-I want the unicorn to fart.</i>
-I can't believe I'm doing this.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.916
-Go, Graz!

02:47.000 --> 02:49.878
Why are we doing this?
Because we make things. That's what we do.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.922
-Thought we weren't supposed to have fun.
-I'm not having fun!

02:53.840 --> 02:55.717
We're gonna show these kids,
if they dream it up…

02:55.800 --> 02:58.803
<i>I want it to be a guitar boat that floats.</i>

02:58.887 --> 03:00.013
You're onto something there.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.681
…it can be built.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.685
<i>Oh, that is so cool!</i>

03:05.768 --> 03:07.687
Hey, it might even
inspire them to build

03:07.770 --> 03:09.939
outside their little <i>Minecraft</i> -y world,
or whatever.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.816
-Do I wanna do it?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.401
Dumbest thing we've ever made.

03:13.484 --> 03:16.571
Not really.
But this isn't about me, is it?

03:16.654 --> 03:18.781
-So here we are.
<i>-You better get to work!</i>

03:18.865 --> 03:21.117
Funny how their dreams are my nightmare.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.245
Come on, Jimmy. Have some fun.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.163
Whatever.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.178
-Why is it called a unicorn?
-"Uni." One.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.597
But "corn."
Shouldn't it be unihorn?

03:42.680 --> 03:44.098
Corn is horn in French.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.141
-Is it?
-Yeah.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.184
Is it really?

03:46.267 --> 03:48.353
-Yeah.
-So a unicorn…

03:48.895 --> 03:50.939
-Should be a unihorn.
-Where's the corn?

03:51.022 --> 03:52.398
-Corn means horn in French.
-See?

03:52.482 --> 03:54.025
He's gotta check his French.

03:54.108 --> 03:56.152
-Oh, yeah.
-He's not even French.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.362
He's Canadian.

03:57.445 --> 03:58.571
-Oh, yeah.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.991
Man, can I ask you a question?
What do you call… corn?

04:02.492 --> 04:03.868
<i>-Mais.</i>
<i>-Mais?</i>

04:03.952 --> 04:04.786
<i>-Mais.</i>
<i>-Mais.</i>

04:04.869 --> 04:07.247
What about a corn maze?
What would you call that?

04:21.594 --> 04:22.428
<i>Mais</i> maze.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.182
Let's move on.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.643
-Come on.
-We'll talk later. Dude.

04:28.726 --> 04:29.686
-Ready?
-Yeah.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.354
Let's do this. Bring it up.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.400
Oh, hey! Tell me your names, young men.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.819
<i>I am Connor, and this is Eli.</i>

04:37.902 --> 04:41.281
-You guys look like insurance salesmen.
<i>-No! </i>

04:41.364 --> 04:43.408
-Hi. What's your name?
<i>-Savannah.</i>

04:43.491 --> 04:44.575
-Savannah?
<i>-Uh-huh.</i>

04:44.659 --> 04:47.161
Are those your drawings
on the wall behind you?

04:47.245 --> 04:49.497
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-You better be nice to her.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.582
-You're a very good artist.
<i>-Thank you.</i>

04:51.666 --> 04:52.792
She's too adorable.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.461
We might have to make
whatever she says, guys. I'm sorry.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.421
Tell me your names.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.798
<i>-Vada.</i>
<i>-My name's Brennan.</i>

04:58.881 --> 05:00.216
Are you guys twins?

05:00.300 --> 05:01.801
-<i>Yes.</i>
-Whoa.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.387
Can you guys answer every single thing
at the exact same time?

05:04.470 --> 05:05.305
<i> Yes.</i>

05:05.388 --> 05:06.973
Have you guys seen <i>The Shining?</i>

05:07.557 --> 05:08.474
<i>No.</i>

05:10.476 --> 05:12.729
You have inventions
you want to tell me about?

05:12.812 --> 05:14.814
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Uh-oh, we got paperwork.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.316
<i>This is Air Boots.</i>

05:16.399 --> 05:18.443
-It's got a "turbo." I see that.
Yeah, I see "turbo."

05:18.526 --> 05:22.113
All right. So we have a storage rack
to store air and keep your balance.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.949
<i>-Yes.</i>
-So you're pitching me a walking shelf?

05:25.033 --> 05:26.284
<i>Yes.</i>

05:27.452 --> 05:28.369
Wow.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.205
<i>Our idea is going to be a boat.</i>

05:31.289 --> 05:33.166
-A boat?
<i>-Chicken-head boat.</i>

05:33.249 --> 05:34.542
A chicken-head boat.

05:34.625 --> 05:37.295
<i>And it can dance on land.</i>

05:37.879 --> 05:38.796
Anything else?

05:38.880 --> 05:40.715
<i>It's voice-activated.</i>

05:42.550 --> 05:45.762
<i>Okay. This is a big narwhal.</i>

05:45.845 --> 05:47.305
Tell me what a narwhal is.

05:47.388 --> 05:50.808
<i>It's like a seal with a horn for its nose.</i>

05:50.892 --> 05:53.102
I think they're called
"the unicorns of the sea."

05:55.229 --> 05:56.981
-You better not break her heart, Jimmy.
-Yeah.

05:57.065 --> 06:00.360
So imagine you and I
are on an escalator. Okay?

06:00.443 --> 06:01.444
<i> Yep.</i>

06:01.527 --> 06:04.364
By the time we get to the top,
you have to tell me your whole idea.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.032
<i>-Yep.</i>
-Go!

06:06.115 --> 06:09.369
<i>It is like a theme park,</i>
<i>a very small theme park.</i>

06:09.452 --> 06:11.996
<i>The room right here is for yoga.</i>

06:12.080 --> 06:14.791
<i>And, of course, this is the cafeteria</i>

06:14.874 --> 06:16.667
<i>where people can eat pizza.</i>

06:16.751 --> 06:17.710
<i>Yum, yum, yum.</i>

06:17.794 --> 06:19.087
I love it.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.129
<i>This room here--</i>

06:20.213 --> 06:22.673
Wait. This isn't the escalator
at the Mall of America.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.802
This is the escalator
in the subway of New York.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.264
<i>Okay. So…</i>

06:32.517 --> 06:36.104
Okay. So, five words or less,
describe your invention to me.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.271
<i>Fast boots!</i>

06:37.355 --> 06:38.272
And?

06:38.356 --> 06:39.399
<i>Jumping boots!</i>

06:39.482 --> 06:41.025
<i>Fast boots, jumping boots.</i>

06:41.109 --> 06:44.070
That's four. Okay.
one more word and you might sell it.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.363
<i>And then storage.</i>

06:47.281 --> 06:50.701
-Five words.
<i>-Our idea is going to be a boat.</i>

06:50.785 --> 06:53.079
<i>And it has a chicken head on the front,</i>

06:53.162 --> 06:55.039
<i>and it has wings.</i>

06:55.623 --> 06:56.916
That's like 85 words.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.085
<i>And it can swim in the water!</i>

06:59.168 --> 07:05.216
We're not going to do your idea!

07:07.552 --> 07:09.011
Say storage one more time.

07:10.054 --> 07:11.889
<i>Storage! Storage! Storage!</i>

07:11.973 --> 07:13.683
Don't do it, Jimmy! Don't do it.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.143
-Out!
-No!

07:15.226 --> 07:17.728
This is gonna hurt me
more than it hurts you.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.772
But we're gonna have to go
in another direction.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.190
<i>-Thank you.</i>
-Thank you.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.108
Next.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.989
Hey, guys. What's your names?

07:28.072 --> 07:29.699
<i>-I'm Izzy.</i>
-Izzy?

07:29.782 --> 07:31.742
<i>-I'm Olivia.</i>
-Izzy and Olivia.

07:31.826 --> 07:34.120
Can I ask you guys
what do you want to be when you grow up?

07:34.203 --> 07:36.914
<i>I want to be an African soccer player.</i>

07:36.998 --> 07:39.208
An African soccer player? And Izzy?

07:39.292 --> 07:43.254
<i>I wanna be a veterinarian in China</i>
<i>so I can help pandas!</i>

07:43.337 --> 07:46.090
-Wow, that's amazing.
Very detailed.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.800
<i>I love pandas.</i>

07:47.884 --> 07:50.887
-Now do you guys have ideas to pitch us?
<i>-Yes.</i>

07:50.970 --> 07:53.931
Tell me in five words
what this invention is about.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.309
<i>Panda Paradise Soccer Shoe Car.</i>

07:56.809 --> 07:58.769
Panda Paradise Soccer Shoe Car?

07:58.853 --> 08:02.315
<i>Yeah. I want to build</i>
<i>a humongous soccer shoe.</i>

08:02.398 --> 08:04.358
You want to build a soccer shoe?

08:04.442 --> 08:06.194
<i>Big as a house!</i>

08:06.277 --> 08:07.153
<i>Yeah!</i>

08:07.236 --> 08:10.281
-Perfect.
Why do we wanna make a soccer shoe car?

08:10.364 --> 08:13.326
<i>I want to drive in a shoe,</i>

08:13.409 --> 08:14.660
<i>and she likes soccer.</i>

08:14.744 --> 08:17.038
<i>So it's a soccer shoe car!</i>

08:17.955 --> 08:19.415
Brilliant! Yeah. I love it.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.752
All my kids played soccer,
I have a daughter named Olivia,

08:22.835 --> 08:24.378
and I always wanted a panda.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.047
-What do you think?
-I don't know.

08:26.130 --> 08:29.425
If we made it big enough, I could
sit in it, drive it around, look silly.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.761
-Paul, what do you think?
-Sounds fun.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.804
-Get a big ball, kick it.
-I like pandas.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.389
-I like pandas too.
-I love it.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.016
-It kind of makes sense.
-Yeah.

08:37.099 --> 08:39.352
What color do you see the soccer shoe?

08:40.019 --> 08:42.688
<i>Black and white like a panda!</i>

08:42.772 --> 08:45.775
Maybe we could put some,
like, panda bear graphics on it.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.737
-Oh, you just blew her mind.
-I think she's gonna explode.

08:49.820 --> 08:53.449
<i>-Soccer panda. Soccer panda.</i>
<i>-Soccer panda. Soccer panda.</i>

08:53.533 --> 08:55.868
-We wanna do it, Jimmy.
-Eh, we'll do the idea!

08:55.952 --> 08:57.787
-<i>Yes!</i>
-We'll let you know when it's done.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.706
<i>-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>
All right. Shut them up. Let's go.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.959
-All right. Let's get to work.

09:06.170 --> 09:09.674
You heard the girls.
Panda Soccer Shoe Car.

09:10.258 --> 09:14.262
I'm picturing a soccer shoe on wheels,

09:15.096 --> 09:17.682
cleats, maybe a panda.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.810
We're gonna have it
kick a big ball, I think.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.604
And we're talking about maybe
putting something in the tip of this.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.773
This way we could sneak up
on the ball and hit it.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.067
Like something that explodes
or a punching device?

09:28.150 --> 09:29.277
How about a boxing glove?

09:29.360 --> 09:31.445
-Okay. A boxing glove.
-Like in a cartoon.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.364
The thing
we're gonna need to figure out

09:33.447 --> 09:35.408
is what's gonna be this vehicle

09:36.075 --> 09:37.827
that we build the shoe on?

09:38.369 --> 09:40.079
I was thinking
like a zero turn lawn mower.

09:40.162 --> 09:43.624
A zero turn lawn mower is cool,
but I don't want to fiddle around with…

09:43.708 --> 09:45.126
-Gasoline and stuff.
-Gasoline.

09:45.209 --> 09:48.462
An electric vehicle would be easy
because we don't have to dilly dally

09:48.546 --> 09:50.131
with any of the motor parts.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.133
-So golf cart.
-Electric golf cart?

09:52.216 --> 09:53.718
-Brilliant.
-Golf cart. Yeah.

09:53.801 --> 09:54.760
That makes it easy.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.763
For the structure of the sneaker,
we'll start with some wooden strips.

09:57.847 --> 09:58.889
Kinda like a strip canoe.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.933
And then on top of that,
we'll build some skin.

10:01.017 --> 10:04.937
Combination of, like, foam, vinyl,
leather accents for the outside.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.981
Jackman, you're okay
with making the punch?

10:07.064 --> 10:09.025
You guys work together
making the punch mechanism.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.569
-Okay. Yeah.
-You can use that engineer brain of yours.

10:11.652 --> 10:14.572
I'll make the frame
kind of like an upside down boat.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.282
-Derek, you and I will work on that.
-Yeah.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.159
Graz, it's on you
to find an electric vehicle.

10:18.242 --> 10:21.245
You're gonna have to strip it down,
get it ready for the sneaker frame,

10:21.329 --> 10:22.622
which is gonna live on top of it.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.373
-Gotcha. Chop shop it.
-Yep.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.208
Is it the stupidest thing
you've ever made?

10:26.292 --> 10:28.919
It's not the stupidest thing
I've ever made, but it's up there.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.297
It's up there.
I've seen you smile a couple times.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.049
You're gonna have some fun with this one.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.718
-Let's get the materials. Let's go.
-All right.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.311
Whoo! Whoo!

10:56.530 --> 10:58.699
-What the hell is it?
-Smell it. Smells good.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.242
Oh, yeah.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.536
That's good stuff.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.540
Okay. You wanna cut it?

11:07.625 --> 11:10.461
Let's be real. A soccer shoe car
is pretty dang ridiculous.

11:10.544 --> 11:13.422
It makes about as much sense
as one of Derek's stories.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.800
My house was like a little zoo
growing up.

11:15.883 --> 11:19.303
We had a hermit crab.
His name was Big Meaty Claws.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.599
But that's our job at hand
right now.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.434
The first step to making a soccer shoe car

11:25.518 --> 11:27.853
is to cut out a soccer shoe shape
out of plywood.

11:27.937 --> 11:31.023
We're laying out the parts
that are gonna become the framework

11:31.107 --> 11:33.567
that's gonna define
the perimeter of the shoe.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.779
The framework is the most important part
of any build.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.156
It's the skeleton
that will hold it all together.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.618
Derek's using a jigsaw because
they're the easiest saw to maneuver

11:42.702 --> 11:45.371
when following
and cutting straight on a line.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.123
I guess it doesn't have to be straight.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.875
Yeah, you didn't want me
to stay on the line, did you?

11:51.419 --> 11:52.461
It's fine.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.053
While Derek and I work
on the shoe outline,

12:01.137 --> 12:03.222
we'll need the golf cart
to be stripped down.

12:03.305 --> 12:06.684
It's the simplest job on this build,
so naturally I've assigned it to Graz.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.904
Now that we have the golf cart,

12:18.988 --> 12:22.032
my job is to take everything
that's non-essential off the thing.

12:22.116 --> 12:25.536
So that's roof, tubing,
back seat, and everything.

12:25.619 --> 12:26.620
Fore!

12:28.247 --> 12:29.373
Ah, it's much better.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.710
The last piece of the puzzle
is the punching mechanism,

12:32.793 --> 12:35.880
which I've left in the capable hands
of our engineer, Jackman.

12:35.963 --> 12:36.797
So…

12:36.881 --> 12:39.258
-And his Canadian sidekick, Pat.
-So…

12:39.341 --> 12:41.093
We need some sort of a mechanism
for the toe.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.595
It'll kick and punch.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.722
It's basically gonna
be a giant boxing glove.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.015
Here's what I'm thinking.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.684
We'll start with the boxing glove.
That'll give us a sense of scale.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.270
We'll use this foam rubber
as a form for the glove,

12:51.353 --> 12:54.064
build that around the PVC pipe.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.692
We'll kinda hot-glue it
and wrap it around itself,

12:56.776 --> 13:00.863
until we get the rough shape of the glove,
and then over that, we'll do vinyl.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.239
-Let's try it.
-Is it ready?

13:02.323 --> 13:04.492
-I smell something burning.
-That's it. Yeah.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.287
I don't know
if that's gonna hold well.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.956
-How's that working out?
-You sure hot glue holds this?

13:11.040 --> 13:13.584
Yeah, yeah. Let me get some wire. 

13:15.294 --> 13:17.338
Just push, push, push, push.

13:17.421 --> 13:21.050
Push and put. Squeeze it.
Squeeze together, push, push. Exactly!

13:21.133 --> 13:24.094
There's so much stress
going on inside this foam rubber.

13:24.178 --> 13:27.139
We're trying to solve the problem
of making it look like a fist.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.100
-Oh, yes. That feels good.
-That's it. I'm excited.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.770
Jimmy! Are you done doing their project

13:32.853 --> 13:34.647
so we can get back on ours?

13:34.730 --> 13:37.483
We're at a standstill
till Graz comes back with the cart.

13:38.150 --> 13:41.153
All right. I got you guys started.
You could finish this from here.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.696
We'll wrap it with canvas.

13:50.454 --> 13:53.582
-It's not bad. The size is okay.
-Yeah. It's perfect.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.918
So what are you thinking?

13:56.001 --> 13:58.504
What I wanna do is,
considering the bottom of the sneaker

13:58.587 --> 14:01.257
is gonna live one foot above the ground…

14:01.340 --> 14:03.551
-Let's cut a bunch of one-foot legs.
-Okay.

14:03.634 --> 14:07.179
And then we'll start building
the ribs and straps, which keep…

14:07.930 --> 14:08.764
You okay?

14:09.348 --> 14:11.767
Yeah, dude. I came in… I don't know…

14:11.851 --> 14:14.520
You must've been distracted
by the work I did, but no,

14:14.603 --> 14:17.523
"Hey. Thanks, Graz,
for doing all that stuff in the hot sun

14:17.606 --> 14:19.859
while you guys are just relaxing in here."

14:20.359 --> 14:22.486
-You did a good job.
-What was that?

14:22.570 --> 14:25.281
-You did a good job.
-Did you get that? He said, "Good job."

14:25.364 --> 14:26.866
I just want to get that on camera

14:26.949 --> 14:29.618
so I can have that
to show my family and my friends.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.288
-You did a good job.
-What was that?

14:32.371 --> 14:35.082
-You did a good job.
-Did you get that? He said, "Good job."

14:35.165 --> 14:36.667
I just want to get that on camera

14:36.750 --> 14:39.670
so I can have that
to show my family and my friends.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.755
-You did a good job.
-What was that?

14:45.175 --> 14:46.594
You did a good job.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.471
You did a good job.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.975
You did a good job.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.646
Jimmy said, "Good job."

14:59.481 --> 15:02.902
Now with the golf cart stripped
down and the outline of the shoe cut out,

15:02.985 --> 15:04.028
the assembly can begin.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.946
Pull it over here, Graz.
That'll be the tip.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.699
Kind of like that.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.534
It'll be kind of like that?

15:18.751 --> 15:21.211
-That's pretty solid.
-Wanna take some supports out?

15:21.295 --> 15:22.922
-Wanna take off the two--
-Not yet.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.591
I wanna build all the strength in
while it's in that position,

15:25.674 --> 15:27.509
so when we take them out it stays there.

15:27.593 --> 15:31.305
-I was hoping this was heavier wire.
-No. We're not gonna use the wire.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.849
-We're gonna use the magic finger.
-Oh, good idea.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.517
See, we're gonna go like this.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.311
From here to here, we're going to go…

15:37.853 --> 15:39.355
-Wow.
-To there. See it?

15:39.438 --> 15:41.440
-Yeah.
-I love the noise it makes.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.192
-Listen.
-From here to here, it'll go…

15:43.275 --> 15:44.109
Whoop!

15:44.193 --> 15:46.862
-Oh, that's a good one.
-And then from here to here…

15:47.446 --> 15:50.616
-Oh man. My favorite part of the show.
-From here to here.

15:50.699 --> 15:54.370
-We're gonna do those ribs on both sides--
-Can you pass the magic finger to me?

15:54.453 --> 15:57.331
It doesn't work on you.
It's gonna look like--

15:57.414 --> 16:00.167
-Look at it. It's working.
-Put that finger someplace else.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.920
Give me a piece of wood.

16:03.003 --> 16:06.799
The ribs of the shoe will be cut out
of plywood and attached to the frame.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.053
That will give us a strong foundation,

16:11.136 --> 16:14.515
and the curved lines will give us
the sneaker shape that we need.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.934
-How's it looking?
-That looks good.

16:17.017 --> 16:20.562
Would you rather
have these curved like this,

16:20.646 --> 16:22.564
or would you rather have them straight on?

16:22.648 --> 16:25.359
Go straight on,
and then I'm gonna ask you guys

16:25.442 --> 16:28.237
the difficult task of doing one more
in between each of those.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.655
-Okay.
-Is that all right?

16:29.738 --> 16:31.365
-That's fine.
-We'll be here.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.492
-Thanks for coming.
-Thanks.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.122
Jimmy.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.249
-What?
-Come here a second.

16:40.749 --> 16:43.836
We gotta brainstorm how the door's
gonna work at the front of the shoe.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.796
-Where this is gonna pop out.
-Right.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.006
I have some ideas.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.133
This is what I was thinking.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.392
I see where this is going.

17:13.615 --> 17:16.452
-What do you think?
-It's awesome. I love it!

17:17.202 --> 17:18.328
Boink!

17:19.288 --> 17:22.583
I like the mechanism.
The gizmocity of it's really cool.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.168
The thing that I don't like

17:24.251 --> 17:26.378
is that the doors
are still in the way once we open 'em.

17:26.462 --> 17:29.089
Because we really can't
open them far past 90

17:29.173 --> 17:31.091
because how the pivot points interact.

17:31.175 --> 17:34.678
-Jimmy.
-What if we do it more like a garage door?

17:34.762 --> 17:37.806
-Right.
-Maybe one piece, but it lifts on the toe?

17:37.890 --> 17:39.558
-Jimmy!
-Rather than lifting out.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.060
-Up and out.
-Jimmy!

17:42.436 --> 17:43.771
We were talking beards.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.732
What do you think
Graz would look like if he had a goatee?

17:47.775 --> 17:49.526
-Okay.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.987
-You'd look so funny if you had a goatee.
-Dude.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.989
So you see what I'm thinking.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.409
I'm fine with you experimenting
with the other directional door.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.453
-And then make the best decision.
-Okay.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.413
I gotta deal with these morons.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.791
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Jimmy.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.349
Ooh.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.477
Prototyping.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.497
Looking good, buddy. Looking good.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.165
Looking like a shoe.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.668
The skeleton
of our shoe is complete,

18:47.751 --> 18:49.837
but we still need to fill in the gaps.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.298
And for that,
we will use thin strips of poplar.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.928
Poplar is technically a hardwood
but on the softer side,

18:58.011 --> 19:01.890
so it's easy to bend and you don't risk
cracking it with a staple gun,

19:01.974 --> 19:05.102
which is great because pretty much
any idiot can use one of those.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.064
Ugh!

19:12.651 --> 19:15.279
The idea is to cover
as much of the structure as possible,

19:15.362 --> 19:18.407
so that we have a solid base
to add fabric and vinyl.

19:19.741 --> 19:23.328
-Let's put another one on top--
-No, no, no! Glue this to that.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.289
No. But we got a bump here--

19:25.372 --> 19:27.332
That's okay.
We gotta do the lace thing anyway.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.334
Hold on. Look here. We have one--

19:29.418 --> 19:30.878
I know. It doesn't matter.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.546
Don't waste your time on this.

19:32.629 --> 19:33.964
I hate when dads argue.

19:34.047 --> 19:36.508
-We need it somewhere else. I'll show you.
-No.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.802
Does that mean
we're not going to the arcade tonight?

19:38.886 --> 19:41.471
-Let's put that one right like that.
-No? No arcade?

19:42.222 --> 19:44.641
It's all your fault.
We're breaking up 'cause of you.

19:52.482 --> 19:54.985
I like that
it actually looks like a shoe.

19:55.068 --> 19:58.447
-A little orthopedic but still a shoe.
-It looks like a corrective shoe.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.699
-Yeah.
-Because it's not right nor left.

20:00.782 --> 20:02.618
-It's just straight.
-It's just straight.

20:13.712 --> 20:14.838
I play defensively.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.381
-Yeah. I know.
-Go ahead.

20:16.465 --> 20:20.052
The boxing glove is starting
to look and work like a boxing glove.

20:20.135 --> 20:23.472
It also looks like it's been
sitting in an attic for 30 years.

20:24.514 --> 20:27.100
The next step
is to make it look ready for the ring.

20:27.184 --> 20:30.020
So, Pat, we have
a giant boxing glove here.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.356
-Mm-hmm.
-Next step is to wrap it in vinyl.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.858
To do that,
we made these templates out of paper.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.818
We started with plastic wrapped around it,

20:36.902 --> 20:40.072
and then cut seams
and translated that to flat templates,

20:40.155 --> 20:43.325
which we'll then trace on the vinyl,
cut the vinyl, and wrap the glove.

20:43.408 --> 20:47.537
Let's get back to work…

20:55.629 --> 20:57.965
-Ready for this? Knock him out?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.598
You heard what he said
about your kid and your wife?

21:06.682 --> 21:08.684
-Can't have that.
-Can you kiss me first?

21:08.767 --> 21:11.228
-Go get him! No.
-Yeah, I will, but kiss me first.

21:28.036 --> 21:30.330
So now that that's done,
let's figure out the nose

21:30.414 --> 21:31.832
and how that mechanism's gonna work.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.583
-Get this installed.
-All right.

21:36.795 --> 21:39.756
-That looks better than I expected.
-Right?

21:45.637 --> 21:47.681
Now that
the wooden structure is complete,

21:47.764 --> 21:51.018
we're finally ready
to start adding some design and color.

21:53.603 --> 21:56.440
We chose to cover it in vinyl
because it looks like leather,

21:56.523 --> 21:58.608
but it's more durable
and a heck of a lot cheaper.

21:59.860 --> 22:03.697
And we chose the sky blue color
because that's what we had in the shed.

22:05.949 --> 22:09.328
Don't go too far without pulling
and stretching. Pull it under.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.505
-Well, look at this. Yeah.
-Looks good.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.967
It's those things you put on when you go
into a rich person's house. Shoe dickies.

22:25.719 --> 22:29.264
It may not be the prettiest thing
you've ever seen, at least not yet,

22:29.348 --> 22:32.267
but I know exactly
what it needs to really make it pop.

22:33.643 --> 22:36.396
Jimmy DiResta, the man, and his machine.

22:42.861 --> 22:47.240
By sewing details, like this trim,
that will go around the rim of the shoe

22:47.324 --> 22:52.037
and eventually some panda graphics,
this ugly thing will transform

22:52.120 --> 22:56.083
into a gorgeous
Panda Soccer Shoe Car in no time.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.170
<i>-Attention, Jimmy. Children calling.</i>
-Oh!

23:00.670 --> 23:03.215
<i>-Attention, Jimmy. Children calling.</i>

23:04.674 --> 23:06.176
<i>-Hi.</i>
<i>-Hi.</i>

23:06.259 --> 23:09.846
Look who it is.
The little soccer wacko and the furry.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.348
What's with the panda suit?

23:11.431 --> 23:13.558
<i>I'm in love with pandas.</i>

23:13.642 --> 23:15.519
I think I heard a thing or two about that.

23:15.602 --> 23:18.897
<i>And I kind of go all out</i>
<i>because I got my socks.</i>

23:18.980 --> 23:19.940
That's very cute.

23:20.023 --> 23:21.983
<i>And then I got my earrings.</i>

23:22.067 --> 23:24.820
<i>I also have like</i>
<i>a million panda pajammies.</i>

23:24.903 --> 23:28.407
All right, all right. Get to the point.
We gotta get back to work here.

23:28.490 --> 23:29.658
<i>How fast is it gonna be?</i>

23:29.741 --> 23:32.869
-Fast. It's gonna go 800 miles an hour.
-Say what?

23:32.953 --> 23:34.830
<i>Yay! That's fast.</i>

23:35.622 --> 23:37.082
<i>Are there pandas?</i>

23:37.165 --> 23:40.919
We're gonna have a live panda.
We're getting panda babies smuggled in.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.337
<i>I don't think that's true.</i>

23:42.421 --> 23:45.132
-No. that's a different show.
-<i>Locked Up Abroad.</i>

23:46.299 --> 23:49.136
<i>Wait. What color is it,</i>
<i>or like what color or colors?</i>

23:49.219 --> 23:52.514
Blue, we got blue
and a little bit of white.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.599
<i>-That's--</i>
<i>-We need more colors!</i>

23:54.683 --> 23:55.517
What?

23:55.600 --> 23:56.810
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

23:56.893 --> 24:00.105
<i>A wrench in the system!</i>
<i>System, system, system.</i>

24:00.188 --> 24:01.648
<i>That sucks!</i>

24:02.149 --> 24:03.608
<i>We need more colors!</i>

24:03.692 --> 24:06.611
I already started
making the thing blue and white.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.280
<i>Purple! Blue!</i>

24:08.363 --> 24:12.075
<i>Yellow! Orange! Red! Green! Black!</i>

24:12.159 --> 24:14.369
-I think that's all the colors.
<i>-And pink!</i>

24:14.453 --> 24:16.163
-Mmm.
-Fine, fine.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.415
It's gonna be a Panda Soccer Shoe

24:18.498 --> 24:22.210
with all the colors in the rainbow
and black and white.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.045
-Yay!
-Are we good?

24:24.129 --> 24:26.756
-<i>Very.</i>
-All right. Go! Let me get back to work!

24:26.840 --> 24:29.009
<i>Okay, Mr. Grouch!</i>

24:29.092 --> 24:31.094
Dude, can't you ever be happy?

24:31.678 --> 24:33.305
-I can!
What makes you happy?

24:34.347 --> 24:35.390
Being mean.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.642
<i>That is so you!</i>

24:37.726 --> 24:39.060
Everybody shut up.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.021
You heard the girls.

24:42.022 --> 24:45.066
We gotta come up
with some idea for colors, colors, colors.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.776
Yep. We can spray paint that.

24:47.277 --> 24:48.695
Spray painting is an option.

24:48.778 --> 24:51.448
My first thought was tie-dye.
Like you do to a t-shirt.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.450
Tie-dye. How do we tie-dye vinyl?

24:53.533 --> 24:56.453
You do, like, um, like with spray paint.

24:56.536 --> 24:57.954
You ever see a hydrodip?

24:58.038 --> 25:00.916
You spray it into the water,
you dip it in there--

25:00.999 --> 25:02.125
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:02.209 --> 25:06.421
So if we have a big tub,
and we have water in that tub,

25:06.505 --> 25:09.216
and we spray-paint right onto the surface.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.968
-Yeah.
-We can't put the whole sneaker in.

25:12.052 --> 25:15.013
No. We can do sections of it
instead of doing the whole thing.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.223
That'd be way too big.

25:16.306 --> 25:21.019
So all the colors of the paint will be
floating on the surface of the water.

25:21.102 --> 25:24.981
And then we take that thing,
which is a strip that'll be…

25:25.065 --> 25:27.150
-And we…
-I thought it was a horseshoe.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.653
This is a detail strip off of the cleat.

25:29.736 --> 25:31.029
Like the side of the shoe.

25:31.112 --> 25:34.824
And we'll dip it through the hydro,
and it would have all colors on it.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.243
-Cool.
-Whoop.

25:36.326 --> 25:39.162
-I like it.
-It's gonna be trippy.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.039
Oh!

25:42.499 --> 25:43.875
<i>More colors!</i>

25:47.087 --> 25:48.046
Oh!

25:48.630 --> 25:51.675
<i>Orange! Green! Blue! Yellow!</i>

25:51.758 --> 25:53.718
<i>Every color of the rainbow!</i>

25:54.844 --> 25:55.845
<i>And pink!</i>

25:56.846 --> 25:57.764
Oh!

26:01.851 --> 26:03.979
-You guys good with the hydrodipping?
-Yep.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.981
You gotta make the cleats.
Don't forget that part.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.108
Get to work on the punching mechanism.
Get it done.

26:08.191 --> 26:10.735
-Okay.
-I'll work on some details on the sneaker.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.487
-Okay.
-We'll be back.

26:20.787 --> 26:24.499
So basically with hydro dipping,
the oil paint stays on top of the water.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.377
When we take the stripes,
put it through the paint.

26:27.460 --> 26:28.420
When you take it up,

26:28.503 --> 26:31.464
there's gonna be a nice marbleized effect
on top the stripe.

26:31.548 --> 26:34.384
It's gonna look really cool.
Izzy and Olivia are gonna love it.

26:37.178 --> 26:39.806
-All right.
-All right. Let's do it.

26:39.889 --> 26:41.099
-Oh man.
-Dad noise.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.809
They need to get pools that are higher up.

26:42.892 --> 26:43.727
Seriously.

26:45.061 --> 26:47.856
All right.
So this is a panel Jimmy stitched up.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.900
We're gonna try this one. See how it looks
with a little pink and blue.

26:50.984 --> 26:52.360
-Yeah.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.864
-Give me that pink.

26:59.576 --> 27:00.869
Okay. That's good.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.705
You ready? Do it.

27:04.914 --> 27:08.168
-Wait for it. Wait for it.
-Hold. Hold.

27:08.668 --> 27:09.919
-Do it!
-One, two, three.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.422
Oh!

27:12.922 --> 27:14.507
It's definitely colors.

27:15.342 --> 27:16.968
-We nailed it.
-Nailed it.

27:17.886 --> 27:18.803
<i>Nailed it.</i>

27:22.807 --> 27:23.642
Next.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.484
Oh, yeah. This is gonna be awesome.

27:33.276 --> 27:34.486
It's gonna be cool.

27:34.569 --> 27:35.695
-You ready?
-Before…

27:36.279 --> 27:37.530
Go. Pull it.

27:39.366 --> 27:40.700
Oh, damn!

27:44.579 --> 27:46.456
-That's nice.
-Love it. Looks good.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.209
-What colors we doing?
-Green and blue.

27:49.292 --> 27:51.503
-We shake them up?
-No. Not yet.

28:09.312 --> 28:10.230
Nailed it.

28:11.606 --> 28:13.525
I think we might have a future in this.

28:13.608 --> 28:15.068
Color me impressed.

28:16.152 --> 28:19.155
-I'm gonna put it out to dry in the sun.
-All right.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.959
So paracord is made from nylon,

28:31.042 --> 28:34.379
petroleum product, which is why it melts
instead of burning like cotton would.

28:34.462 --> 28:35.338
Hmm.

28:38.174 --> 28:40.176
Look at how much I've gotten done.

28:41.177 --> 28:43.304
And look at how much they've gotten done.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.140
-We have springs and pulleys.
-Yep.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.600
We're gonna use those
to open up the toe of the shoe.

28:47.684 --> 28:49.394
The springs take some weight off,

28:49.477 --> 28:52.355
and then we'll have some string
and attach that to a mechanism

28:52.439 --> 28:55.900
inside the seat of the golf cart.
That'll allow us to open the toe.

28:55.984 --> 28:56.818
Let's do that.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.486
I wonder if the production team

28:58.570 --> 29:02.532
can edit some sort
of montage-y thing with the spring.

29:04.367 --> 29:05.577
That sounds pretty good.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.997
Because that sounds like a bass.
So let's slap it.

29:15.462 --> 29:16.838
<i>Slap it.</i>

29:21.468 --> 29:22.886
<i>Slap it.</i>

29:25.013 --> 29:26.890
You wanna lift up? Oh, yeah.

29:27.557 --> 29:28.725
<i>Slap it.</i>

29:28.808 --> 29:31.060
-Oh.
-And now, these pulleys.

29:31.144 --> 29:32.103
<i>Slap it.</i>

29:32.187 --> 29:33.021
Engineering.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.690
So the next is just figuring out
where we're attaching the glove,

29:35.774 --> 29:36.983
and how we're gonna attach it.

29:37.066 --> 29:39.027
-Yeah.
-How could we make that work?

29:40.612 --> 29:42.322
-Here's an idea.
<i>Slap, it's a bass.</i>

29:42.405 --> 29:44.657
Take this bar and attach it.

29:44.741 --> 29:45.742
<i>Engineering.</i>

29:45.825 --> 29:48.369
-Then we can weld two metal brackets.
-<i>Slap, it's a bass.</i>

29:48.453 --> 29:51.372
-Put them on the bar, so they can slide.
<i>-Engineering.</i>

29:51.456 --> 29:53.625
Then put in the glove
and attach from the side. Yeah.

29:56.669 --> 29:58.171
What are you guys doing?

30:00.173 --> 30:01.007
We're almost done.

30:01.090 --> 30:04.177
I hate to be a buttinsky but this year?
What are you thinking?

30:04.260 --> 30:05.804
-We'll be done soon.
-Okay.

30:05.887 --> 30:06.846
It's finicky.

30:09.432 --> 30:10.767
Here's how it works.

30:11.267 --> 30:15.104
We've attached a metal tube to the top
of the box that serves as a track.

30:15.188 --> 30:17.148
These metal brackets
hold the glove in place

30:17.232 --> 30:20.485
as it slides back and forth
on the track in a punching action.

30:20.568 --> 30:22.612
Hey, Jimmy. Come here a second?

30:27.158 --> 30:28.326
Pow!

30:29.327 --> 30:30.328
<i>Banzai!</i>

30:32.789 --> 30:33.623
Not bad.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.043
-You heard that?
He said it.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.171
He said it's not bad,
which means it's good.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.799
All right. Now that the boxing glove

30:42.882 --> 30:44.884
and the nose is done,
we have to finish this.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.719
We have to get the hydrodip strips on,

30:46.803 --> 30:50.181
we gotta put the cleats in place,
we have to install the laces,

30:50.265 --> 30:51.683
finish putting the vinyl on.

30:51.766 --> 30:54.519
I have to get on the sewing machine,
start making some panda graphics.

30:54.602 --> 30:56.729
There is still a tremendous amount to do.

30:56.813 --> 31:00.608
Wait. So are you saying
we'll work on it toe-gether?

31:05.613 --> 31:07.740
I hate American comedy.

31:09.909 --> 31:11.327
Let's go! Come on!

31:11.828 --> 31:13.121
Grab the glove, Pat?

31:13.746 --> 31:15.456
This giant waste of time

31:15.540 --> 31:18.084
we're calling
the Soccer Shoe Car is almost done.

31:18.167 --> 31:21.838
We have some final touches to make,
so it's gonna be all hands on deck.

31:21.921 --> 31:24.883
The sooner this thing is finished,
the sooner I can go home.

31:26.426 --> 31:29.095
Derek's gonna make some
giant shoelaces out of fire hose,

31:29.178 --> 31:30.513
and of course…

31:30.597 --> 31:31.681
<i>More colors!</i>

31:31.764 --> 31:33.433
They have to be colorful.

31:34.434 --> 31:37.687
Jackman's going to install, well, Pat.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.063
Watch your nuts, Pat.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.983
And Pat's going to
install the glove cage.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.234
And when he's done…

31:44.736 --> 31:48.072
…he'll put his master woodworking
skills to good use on the lathe

31:48.156 --> 31:49.908
because we're gonna need a lever handle

31:49.991 --> 31:52.243
that can be controlled
from the driver's seat.

31:54.954 --> 31:58.791
Making the cleats seemed like
an easy enough task for Graz and Derek.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.420
-All right. And the cleats are done.
-Whoa!

32:02.503 --> 32:04.756
But somehow, they managed to screw it up.

32:04.839 --> 32:07.175
-What color is this supposed to be?
-Salmon.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.718
It's like glittery diarrhea.

32:08.801 --> 32:10.929
They were pink,
but I don't know what happened.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.390
Now Graz has to attach the cleats…

32:15.975 --> 32:17.393
and the hydrodip panels.

32:19.854 --> 32:21.064
Last but not least,

32:21.564 --> 32:23.650
we have to panda-fy this stupid thing.

32:25.401 --> 32:27.904
Otherwise, Izzy's gonna throw a hissy fit.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.787
I gotta say,
even though this was thought up by kids,

32:36.537 --> 32:37.622
I think it came out great.

32:37.705 --> 32:38.581
Yep.

32:38.665 --> 32:41.709
-Looks just like a sneaker.
-It's got a lot of "sole."

32:43.378 --> 32:44.253
Let's go.

32:44.754 --> 32:45.713
All right.

32:46.464 --> 32:49.717
I think this is the best build
in the whole "shoeniverse."

32:49.801 --> 32:51.344
Oh, you're so punny.

33:02.563 --> 33:04.857
Are you getting smaller,
right here while we stand?

33:05.441 --> 33:08.027
-Seems like you're 100 feet away.
-Get your eyes checked.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.696
All right, let's get started.

33:09.779 --> 33:11.322
Take your positions. Let's go.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.119
Let's get Izzy and Olivia
up on the screen.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.830
<i>-Just try to be as careful…</i>
-Hey!

33:18.913 --> 33:20.123
<i>-Hello!</i>
<i>-Hello!</i>

33:20.206 --> 33:22.375
Do you remember what you asked for?
Tell me right now.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.043
<i>A Panda Paradise…</i>

33:24.127 --> 33:26.129
<i>Soccer Shoe Car.</i>

33:26.212 --> 33:27.630
With all the colors.

33:27.714 --> 33:29.215
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

33:29.298 --> 33:32.343
And I agreed.
You know why? Because I'm a nice guy.

33:32.885 --> 33:35.638
-No, you're not!

33:36.139 --> 33:38.766
Fine. Are you ready
to see your soccer shoe car?

33:38.850 --> 33:40.309
<i>Yes!</i>

33:40.393 --> 33:41.519
Are you ready?

33:42.061 --> 33:43.021
<i>Yes!</i>

33:43.104 --> 33:45.732
Do you guys realize
I have four children over here with beards

33:45.815 --> 33:47.025
ready to show you that car?

33:47.108 --> 33:48.735
<i>I can't wait any longer.</i>

33:48.818 --> 33:50.111
<i>Me neither.</i>

33:50.194 --> 33:52.030
All right, guys. Hit it!

34:12.216 --> 34:14.719
As you can see,
we wrapped it with vinyl and leather,

34:14.802 --> 34:16.387
just like a proper soccer shoe.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.805
You guys asked for all the colors.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.391
So we did this really cool
hydrodipping process.

34:20.475 --> 34:23.186
-<i>Oh my God!</i>
-We have the beautiful laces.

34:23.269 --> 34:26.856
They're made from fire hose recycled
from the fire department down the street.

34:26.939 --> 34:28.316
<i>Seriously?</i>

34:28.399 --> 34:30.526
No. Just kidding. That's human skin.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.405
We had the panda logo

34:34.489 --> 34:37.033
because a giant soccer shoe
on its own isn't ridiculous enough.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.242
<i>Yeah!</i>

34:38.743 --> 34:40.870
Here we have your names
in gold leaf.

34:40.953 --> 34:42.705
<i>That's so cool!</i>

34:42.789 --> 34:45.249
Beautiful epoxy cleats.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.542
Supposed to be pink,

34:46.626 --> 34:50.296
but Derek and Graz somehow
made it some kinda ugly salmon color.

34:50.379 --> 34:51.714
<i>Yay!</i>

34:51.798 --> 34:53.508
<i>They're good. I like them.</i>

34:53.591 --> 34:54.467
<i>I love them!</i>

34:54.550 --> 34:57.553
Are you guys ready to see
what is the coolest thing about this car?

34:57.637 --> 34:58.513
<i>-Yes!</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>

34:58.596 --> 35:00.223
All right, Jackman.
Give us a demo.

35:00.306 --> 35:02.683
What do you think
this handle does if I pull on it?

35:02.767 --> 35:04.018
<i>I don't know.</i>

35:04.102 --> 35:05.144
<i>Blows fire?</i>

35:05.812 --> 35:07.355
"It blows fire" is a better idea.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.439
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.066
<i>-Do it!</i>
Three…

35:10.149 --> 35:11.943
<i>-Two, one…</i>
-Two, one…

35:12.026 --> 35:13.277
Go!

35:17.073 --> 35:18.032
<i>What?</i>

35:20.535 --> 35:21.494
<i>God!</i>

35:21.577 --> 35:22.912
<i>That's so cool!</i>

35:26.165 --> 35:27.375
<i>Oh my God! Oh my God!</i>

35:29.252 --> 35:31.671
That's gonna punch a soccer ball
into next week.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.466
I bet you wanna see this thing
score some goals. Right?

35:35.550 --> 35:36.384
<i>-Yeah!</i>
-Yeah.

35:46.102 --> 35:49.438
Izzy, Olivia, welcome
to the World Cup of Dumb.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.942
-USA!
-<i>USA!</i>

35:53.025 --> 35:54.235
Panda!

35:57.446 --> 35:58.447
You guys ready?

35:58.531 --> 35:59.574
<i>Yeah!</i>

36:00.825 --> 36:04.328
<i>If you're just tuning in,</i>
<i>it's been a riveting, scoreless match</i>

36:04.412 --> 36:08.791
<i>between Sleeveless United</i>
<i>and Two Men One Shoe FC.</i>

36:08.875 --> 36:10.793
<i>And now it all comes down to this.</i>

36:10.877 --> 36:13.212
<i>One kick to decide it all.</i>

36:13.296 --> 36:16.966
<i>One old, old referee, indeed.</i>

36:18.384 --> 36:20.219
-Play ball!

36:20.303 --> 36:22.138
Or whatever they say in soccer.

36:22.221 --> 36:23.347
<i>Play ball!</i>

36:25.099 --> 36:27.727
<i>The car is in motion, building speed.</i>

36:27.810 --> 36:29.645
-Come on!
-Just going straight here.

36:30.229 --> 36:32.815
<i>Here's the kick!</i>

36:33.441 --> 36:34.609
<i>They shoot! Oh!</i>

36:34.692 --> 36:36.819
<i>Keeper's off his line.</i>

36:40.698 --> 36:47.496
-Goal!
-Goal!

36:47.580 --> 36:49.624
<i>-Yay!</i>

36:49.707 --> 36:51.834
In your face!

36:51.918 --> 36:53.794
Derek! Jimmy!

36:54.295 --> 36:56.464
-Izzy! Olivia!

36:58.424 --> 36:59.842
Are you happy, Izzy, Olivia?

36:59.926 --> 37:00.927
<i>Yeah!</i>

37:01.010 --> 37:03.387
<i>Panda Paradise Soccer Shoe Car!</i>

37:03.471 --> 37:04.555
All right!

37:05.139 --> 37:07.099
<i>You're kinda grumpy for an old guy.</i>

37:07.183 --> 37:09.435
What are you still doing here?
Get off the farm.

37:09.518 --> 37:10.811
<i>-Bye!</i>
<i>-Bye.</i>

37:10.895 --> 37:12.939
-Bye, Izzy and Olivia.
-Oh man.

37:13.022 --> 37:14.982
Why are you always mean to the kids?

37:15.066 --> 37:16.359
Clean this crap up.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.695
I'll go get you a dust pan.

37:19.779 --> 37:20.655
Oh!

37:20.738 --> 37:21.906
Get off my farm!

37:24.116 --> 37:24.992
Watch out!

37:30.873 --> 37:34.043
-I don't think we're gonna make it!
-Gotta go eight miles an hour.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.841
Six! We're almost there!

38:03.155 --> 38:06.450
Whoo!

38:06.534 --> 38:07.827
It worked!

38:07.910 --> 38:09.787
Why do we hang out with these guys?

38:10.288 --> 38:11.122
Beats me.
