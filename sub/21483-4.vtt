WEBVTT

00:02.859 --> 00:04.330
RUXIN: Mmm! Mmm!

00:04.332 --> 00:05.328
No?

00:05.330 --> 00:08.562
Just, let's not... No, Baby Jeffery, not...
No, no, Baby Jeffery, sorry.

00:08.564 --> 00:09.559
Sorry.

00:09.561 --> 00:10.359
So sorry.

00:10.361 --> 00:10.860
(anxious laugh)

00:10.862 --> 00:12.626
Ow... (baby laughing)

00:12.628 --> 00:15.393
Good arm.

00:15.395 --> 00:18.863
Hey, Ashley, it's Ruxin
calling you for a third time.

00:18.865 --> 00:22.800
Um, wondering if you are going
to show up here, because I am

00:22.802 --> 00:28.139
dealing with a child who I'm paying
you to deal with while Sofia's away.

00:28.141 --> 00:29.745
Baby Jeffery, no, please stop.

00:29.747 --> 00:31.480
Okay, uh, please call me back.

00:31.482 --> 00:32.580
Okay? Bye.

00:32.582 --> 00:33.581
Thank you.

00:33.583 --> 00:34.548
Um, hey, Dom?

00:34.550 --> 00:35.250
Quick question.

00:35.252 --> 00:36.185
Would you watch him?

00:36.187 --> 00:38.087
I've got to go
take a number one.

00:38.089 --> 00:39.188
No.

00:39.190 --> 00:40.356
No, absolutely not.

00:40.358 --> 00:44.159
Okay, um, yeah.

00:44.161 --> 00:46.427
Baby Jeffery, everything in a
public restroom is on fire.

00:46.429 --> 00:48.862
No, you can't...

00:49.630 --> 00:51.363
Okay.

00:51.365 --> 00:53.498
Okay, here we go.

00:53.500 --> 00:59.839
Remember, someone walks in while
you're peeing, no eye contact, okay?

00:59.841 --> 01:00.674
Oh, God, no.

01:00.676 --> 01:01.408
Baby Jeffery!

01:01.410 --> 01:02.409
Don't put that in your mouth!

01:02.411 --> 01:03.210
No, no, no.

01:03.212 --> 01:04.211
No water cookies!

01:04.212 --> 01:06.213
No, oh.

01:06.215 --> 01:08.517
Baby Jeffery, forever unclean.

01:08.519 --> 01:10.452
Oh, God, you're disgusting.

01:10.454 --> 01:12.857
I'm going to fire that au pair.

01:13.206 --> 01:17.543
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrected by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:17.663 --> 01:19.531
Where was my au pair, Pete?

01:19.533 --> 01:20.765
PETE: We were at a concert.

01:20.767 --> 01:22.768
You know, I don't pay
her to service you.

01:22.770 --> 01:25.138
I pay her to service
Baby Jeffery.

01:25.140 --> 01:27.241
Who is now forever unclean.

01:27.243 --> 01:29.476
Let me tell you this, I will
legally take care of him,

01:29.478 --> 01:32.880
because it is my duty, but I
will never love him the same.

01:32.882 --> 01:34.115
ANTON: This is the best.

01:34.117 --> 01:37.251
KEVIN: This is like a thousand
Christmases rubbing up against my balls.

01:37.253 --> 01:38.486
Look, I get it.

01:38.488 --> 01:39.488
You're with a younger woman.

01:39.490 --> 01:42.859
To a 21-year-old, you have a
good job, but, please stop

01:42.861 --> 01:47.097
putting your STD-ridden
corncob in my help.

01:47.099 --> 01:49.433
I have not once slept
with your gardener.

01:49.435 --> 01:51.335
I have dipped a couple of
times into the nanny pool.

01:51.337 --> 01:54.438
It's like he's dating Anna
Nicole Smith, but clean.

01:54.440 --> 01:57.141
And she's dating that rich
Texas oil guy, but poor.

01:57.143 --> 01:57.908
Exactly.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.911
Do you realize what
this has done to me?

01:59.913 --> 02:01.846
I had to go to a restaurant with
Baby Jeffery, and I had to hold

02:01.848 --> 02:05.417
him over my head, and I ended
up peeing all over my legs.

02:05.419 --> 02:08.286
I walked out of that restaurant
looking like I had had a stroke.

02:08.288 --> 02:10.086
Why were you holding
him over your head?

02:10.089 --> 02:11.322
That's bad parenting.

02:11.324 --> 02:14.358
'Cause he was eating the ice
cubes out of the urinal.

02:14.360 --> 02:15.792
(all laughing, groaning)

02:15.794 --> 02:17.260
Water cookies!

02:17.262 --> 02:19.263
TACO: That's why you
should carry a pee bib.

02:19.265 --> 02:20.164
Excuse me?

02:20.166 --> 02:21.332
What's a pee bib?

02:21.334 --> 02:23.769
Carry around a spare
napkin, all the time.

02:23.771 --> 02:26.872
Whenever I have to pee, I tuck it
into my fly, under my Johnson

02:26.874 --> 02:29.174
and-- ta-da-- no pee stains.

02:29.176 --> 02:31.110
So, it's like a piss-kerchief?

02:31.112 --> 02:32.645
A dick dickie.

02:32.647 --> 02:34.347
No, it's a pee bib.

02:34.349 --> 02:35.782
Look, try it out.

02:35.784 --> 02:36.817
I have a million.

02:36.819 --> 02:37.484
Keep it.

02:37.486 --> 02:40.621
Taco, you asshole, these are the
cocktail napkins from my wedding.

02:40.623 --> 02:42.656
I celebrate your union
every time I urinate.

02:42.658 --> 02:43.290
Chill out.

02:43.292 --> 02:43.890
Your wedding's over.

02:43.892 --> 02:46.827
Let the guy piss
on your napkins.

02:47.962 --> 02:49.896
(toilet flushes)

02:49.898 --> 02:53.633
Worked pretty good.

02:53.635 --> 02:55.434
What is that?

02:55.436 --> 02:57.103
No! No!

02:57.105 --> 02:58.537
What are you doing here?

02:58.539 --> 03:00.540
You're not supposed
to be here yet.

03:00.542 --> 03:02.041
It's too early.

03:02.043 --> 03:03.443
Damn it!

03:03.445 --> 03:04.444
Aw.

03:04.446 --> 03:05.578
JENNY: Are you okay?

03:05.580 --> 03:06.713
You look like you saw a ghost.

03:06.715 --> 03:07.947
Sort of.

03:07.949 --> 03:09.582
I just found a white pube!

03:09.584 --> 03:10.717
Oh.

03:10.719 --> 03:11.518
Just one?

03:11.520 --> 03:12.386
Uh, I don't, I don't know.

03:12.388 --> 03:13.787
I haven't looked at
all of them yet.

03:13.789 --> 03:14.254
I think so.

03:14.256 --> 03:15.255
Why?

03:15.257 --> 03:16.390
Um, it's totally natural.

03:16.392 --> 03:18.025
It's very distinguished.

03:18.027 --> 03:20.094
No, George Clooney's
distinguished.

03:20.096 --> 03:22.096
Old grandpa crotch is foul.

03:22.098 --> 03:23.098
It's a rite of passage?

03:23.100 --> 03:26.502
I don't... Oh, God, my
crotch is getting so old.

03:26.504 --> 03:27.636
It hasn't even lived yet.

03:27.638 --> 03:29.104
Thank you, kind sir.

03:29.106 --> 03:30.105
You flatter me.

03:30.107 --> 03:31.006
I appreciate that.

03:31.008 --> 03:34.410
Please, please, you can't
tell anybody about this.

03:34.412 --> 03:35.678
You know, women dye their hair.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.513
You could easily just...
No, no, no.

03:37.515 --> 03:38.747
I'm not dyeing anything.

03:38.749 --> 03:40.016
What is this?

03:40.018 --> 03:42.118
This is, uh, oh, Taco... Oh!

03:42.120 --> 03:43.620
...found napkins
from our wedding.

03:43.622 --> 03:44.254
It's from our wedding.

03:44.256 --> 03:45.488
Oh, my gosh.

03:45.490 --> 03:46.523
Yeah.

03:46.525 --> 03:48.091
What-what's all over it?

03:48.093 --> 03:49.793
Oh, that's my pee.

03:49.795 --> 03:51.428
I urinated on it.

03:51.430 --> 03:53.129
I'm using it as a pee bib.

03:53.131 --> 03:54.998
It's just a bib that
protects my pants.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.333
You'll be happy
in the long run.

03:57.335 --> 04:00.770
So, do you not want me to put
it back in the scrapbook?

04:08.301 --> 04:11.780
I think we are safe.

04:12.152 --> 04:15.478
Thank you for giving me a break
from the wrath of Ruxin.

04:15.718 --> 04:16.950
Oh, please.

04:16.952 --> 04:18.084
He's one of my best friends.

04:18.086 --> 04:18.952
He's a terrible person.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.954
Want to come inside and drink
some of Ruxin's beers?

04:20.956 --> 04:21.922
(toilet flushing)

04:21.923 --> 04:22.923
I think I hear him.

04:22.925 --> 04:23.457
Go on.

04:23.459 --> 04:26.193
I'll see you soon.

04:27.763 --> 04:30.532
Let's see, Ashley.

04:30.534 --> 04:33.669
What can we use to fire you?

04:35.439 --> 04:39.442
Oh, should have shaken more.

04:39.444 --> 04:41.511
Hey, Ruxin, I was thinking...
Oh!

04:41.513 --> 04:42.545
Whoa!

04:42.547 --> 04:43.880
Oh, oh, my God!

04:43.882 --> 04:44.981
No, no, no!

04:44.983 --> 04:45.882
Whoa!

04:45.884 --> 04:48.518
Mr. Ruxin, you disgusting pig!

04:48.520 --> 04:50.553
Were you jerking off
to a picture of me?

04:50.555 --> 04:51.888
I'm not a disgusting pig.

04:51.890 --> 04:53.356
I peed on myself.

04:53.358 --> 04:56.858
Okay, R. Kelly, this is
absolutely terrifying.

04:56.860 --> 04:57.893
So, you're going to quit?

04:57.895 --> 04:58.927
No, I'm not going to quit.

04:58.929 --> 05:00.862
How am I going to hold this
over your head if I quit?

05:00.864 --> 05:04.599
I'm going to stay here, paid, and
use your house like a hotel.

05:04.601 --> 05:07.635
And I'm going to reflect, and
really heal from what I just saw.

05:07.637 --> 05:09.537
I'm in so much pain.

05:09.539 --> 05:11.139
Oh, please.

05:11.141 --> 05:13.008
It's not the first time you've
seen a guy jerking off in front

05:13.010 --> 05:14.576
of you, which I didn't do.

05:14.578 --> 05:17.246
I would be happy to tell
your wife about this.

05:17.248 --> 05:17.946
Don't tell my wife.

05:17.948 --> 05:18.948
I'm going to tell Sofia.

05:18.950 --> 05:19.748
You wouldn't.

05:19.750 --> 05:20.916
Watch me.

05:20.918 --> 05:22.652
(baby crying)

05:22.654 --> 05:24.820
It sounds like a poop cry.

05:24.822 --> 05:26.956
You should go take care of it.

05:26.958 --> 05:28.491
I'm going to grab a beer.

05:28.493 --> 05:33.630
Fine, I like changing diapers.

05:33.632 --> 05:36.233
I fed him turkey
chili for lunch.

05:36.235 --> 05:38.836
Oh, that crib is going
to be a war zone.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.672
I mean, this girl, she sucks
at her job and now I could be

05:41.674 --> 05:44.041
sued for sexual harassment,
and I can't fire her and I'm

05:44.043 --> 05:45.976
not even the one
who's screwing her!

05:45.978 --> 05:49.580
Well, speaking as the one who is,
it's pretty fantastic, actually.

05:49.582 --> 05:50.748
Oh, really?

05:50.750 --> 05:52.616
Au pair!

05:52.618 --> 05:53.517
Au pair!

05:53.519 --> 05:55.753
Au pair!

05:55.755 --> 05:57.355
You guys are straight-up
ruining it.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.123
There's one confusing
element, though.

05:59.125 --> 06:02.760
She has been saying that she
wants to "golden gate" with me.

06:02.762 --> 06:04.462
Are you guys aware
of this term?

06:04.464 --> 06:05.229
Golden gate?

06:05.231 --> 06:06.364
Golden gate?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.265
Golden gate.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.900
Golden gate, I'm assuming
that's somehow pee-related.

06:08.902 --> 06:09.534
No, no, no.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.369
I think it's when you have sex
really early in the morning,

06:11.371 --> 06:13.704
and then right in the middle of it,
you jump off and commit suicide.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.540
No, I think that's called
"having sex with Andre."

06:15.542 --> 06:18.041
That happened one time,
and it was a week later.

06:18.043 --> 06:20.411
I think it's code for anal.

06:20.413 --> 06:22.713
Oh, no, we don't use
code words for that.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.715
Oh! In my house?

06:24.717 --> 06:26.584
Once... Oh, God.

06:26.586 --> 06:27.285
...and a half.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.220
My child sleeps there, Pete.

06:28.222 --> 06:29.054
Well, not in your bed.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.155
All right, that's it.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.223
You have to ask her to quit.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.125
Ruxin, I don't want to date
someone who's unemployed.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.126
Fine.

06:34.128 --> 06:36.663
Well, if I can't fire her, then
I'm going to make her quit.

06:36.665 --> 06:41.935
Speaking of unemployed, do you believe
Carson Palmer is still in his prime?

06:41.937 --> 06:43.136
What's this guy thinking?

06:43.138 --> 06:43.936
What do you care?

06:43.938 --> 06:45.638
Just because he's one of
your red-headed brothers?

06:45.640 --> 06:47.639
What do you mean
red-headed brothers?

06:47.641 --> 06:48.307
What do you think I mean?

06:48.309 --> 06:48.807
You have red hair.

06:48.809 --> 06:49.741
You think I have red hair?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.443
What color do you
think your hair is?

06:51.445 --> 06:52.077
Brown.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.745
Oh, yeah, like
fire engine brown.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.478
No, it's like a light brown.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.447
Oh, like, <i>The Hunt for
Light</i> <i>Brown October?</i>

06:56.449 --> 06:59.016
<i>Kevin your hair is red
and your pubes are red.</i>

06:59.018 --> 06:59.683
<i>No, it's not.</i>

06:59.685 --> 07:01.685
<i>And how would you even know
what color my pubes are?</i>

07:01.687 --> 07:03.987
<i>You think he keeps his eyes
closed when he blows you?</i>

07:03.989 --> 07:04.655
<i>You know what?</i>

07:04.657 --> 07:07.624
<i>I don't have gray...
I don't have red hair, okay?</i>

07:07.626 --> 07:09.693
<i>You guys are dicks, I'm
going to the kitchen.</i>

07:09.695 --> 07:12.362
<i>Kevin, why don't you have a
glass of brown wine and relax?</i>

07:12.364 --> 07:15.699
<i>Asshole.</i>

07:15.701 --> 07:17.434
<i>Jesus, man!</i>

07:17.436 --> 07:19.636
<i>Going gray?</i>

07:19.638 --> 07:20.603
<i>You know, come on.</i>

07:20.605 --> 07:21.304
<i>I heard you.</i>

07:21.306 --> 07:22.638
<i>No, I'm not going gray, okay?</i>

07:22.640 --> 07:25.341
<i>Little dusting
around the temples?</i>

07:25.343 --> 07:27.109
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:27.111 --> 07:27.943
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

07:27.945 --> 07:28.611
<i>I got a couple up here.</i>

07:28.613 --> 07:29.545
<i>I was embarrassed.</i>

07:29.547 --> 07:30.746
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
I'm sorry.</i>

07:30.748 --> 07:31.647
<i>I know.</i>

07:31.649 --> 07:33.482
<i>Look, we all have our
little secrets.</i>

07:33.484 --> 07:35.450
<i>For example, I'm
losing my hair.</i>

07:35.452 --> 07:37.018
<i>No.</i>

07:37.020 --> 07:38.019
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:38.021 --> 07:39.020
<i>Really?</i>

07:39.022 --> 07:43.224
<i>Look, I know a place, Cher would
say, could turn back time.</i>

07:43.226 --> 07:45.026
<i>Okay, enough with
the references.</i>

07:45.028 --> 07:46.695
<i>Okay, when should I pick you up?</i>

07:46.697 --> 07:49.665
<i>Say, 12:00?</i>

07:49.667 --> 07:52.735
<i>I can't believe you're
letting me just stay here.</i>

07:52.737 --> 07:54.136
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:54.138 --> 07:55.738
<i>Make yourself at home.</i>

07:55.740 --> 07:56.906
<i>All right.</i>

07:56.908 --> 07:58.007
<i>Here we are.</i>

07:58.009 --> 07:58.675
<i>This is sweet.</i>

07:58.677 --> 08:00.010
<i>I think I'll sleep out
here, if that's cool.</i>

08:00.012 --> 08:00.677
<i>That would be great.</i>

08:00.679 --> 08:01.678
<i>Naked.</i>

08:01.680 --> 08:02.679
<i>Okay.</i>

08:02.681 --> 08:03.513
<i>That's how I sleep.</i>

08:03.515 --> 08:04.548
<i>I figured.</i>

08:04.550 --> 08:06.583
<i>Because the goose is loose, you
know what I'm talking about?</i>

08:06.585 --> 08:07.417
<i>Uh-huh. No, I do.</i>

08:07.419 --> 08:08.885
<i>It means my wiener
needs to be out.</i>

08:08.887 --> 08:09.552
<i>I know.</i>

08:09.554 --> 08:10.753
<i>Is it cool if Dirty Randy
comes over tonight?</i>

08:10.755 --> 08:12.054
<i>It is absolutely not.</i>

08:12.056 --> 08:13.689
<i>Dirty Randy's coming
over tonight.</i>

08:13.691 --> 08:14.557
<i>No, he's not.</i>

08:14.559 --> 08:15.324
<i>With a bunch of movies.</i>

08:15.326 --> 08:17.593
<i>Hi, Baby Jeff woke
me up from my nap.</i>

08:17.595 --> 08:18.694
<i>Ashley.</i>

08:18.696 --> 08:20.695
<i>Um, this is the au pair Ashley.</i>

08:20.697 --> 08:21.696
<i>What's up?</i>

08:21.698 --> 08:22.697
<i>(inhales gently)</i>

08:22.699 --> 08:24.065
<i>What's that smell?</i>

08:24.067 --> 08:26.101
<i>You smell like something.</i>

08:26.103 --> 08:27.669
<i>Cupcake?</i>

08:27.671 --> 08:29.104
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:29.106 --> 08:33.008
<i>This is my brolo, my el
cuñado Raffi-- and when I'm</i>

08:33.010 --> 08:35.010
<i>gone, Raffi's the
man of the house.</i>

08:35.011 --> 08:36.412
<i>What does the man of the
house get to do, Raf?</i>

08:36.414 --> 08:38.280
<i>Anything he wants to
anybody at anytime.</i>

08:38.282 --> 08:39.715
<i>He's a convicted felon.</i>

08:39.717 --> 08:41.049
<i>Twice.</i>

08:41.052 --> 08:42.717
<i>And he's going to be
staying with us.</i>

08:42.720 --> 08:44.053
<i>You a light sleeper
or a heavy sleeper?</i>

08:44.054 --> 08:44.720
<i>Heavy.</i>

08:44.722 --> 08:46.622
<i>Nice.</i>

08:46.624 --> 08:47.724
<i>Can you just say the word yes?</i>

08:47.726 --> 08:48.958
<i>Just say it out loud.</i>

08:48.960 --> 08:49.959
<i>Yes.</i>

08:49.961 --> 08:50.961
<i>Consent.</i>

08:50.963 --> 08:51.595
<i>You heard it.</i>

08:51.597 --> 08:52.963
<i>You're a lawyer.</i>

08:52.965 --> 08:54.565
<i>I'm going to go to my room.</i>

08:54.567 --> 08:55.966
<i>Just let me know when
dinner's ready.</i>

08:55.968 --> 08:56.967
<i>Okay.</i>

08:56.969 --> 08:58.435
<i>No closed doors.</i>

08:58.437 --> 09:00.871
<i>Well, I think she's
pretty disgusted by you.</i>

09:00.873 --> 09:02.373
<i>Challenge accepted.</i>

09:02.375 --> 09:05.209
<i>Well, you should absolutely
court her, Raffi.</i>

09:05.211 --> 09:09.579
<i>Yeah, I'm going to court martial
her vagina with my wiener.</i>

09:09.581 --> 09:11.047
<i>All right, make
yourself at home.</i>

09:11.049 --> 09:12.082
<i>Cool, thanks.</i>

09:12.084 --> 09:14.317
<i>Just so I know, in this room, I
need for us to decide where</i>

09:14.319 --> 09:15.384
<i>the pee corner is.</i>

09:15.386 --> 09:16.319
<i>There's no pee corner.</i>

09:16.321 --> 09:17.620
<i>No, I know what I do.</i>

09:17.622 --> 09:18.387
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

09:18.389 --> 09:21.335
<i>Like, I'm going to use that as my
pee corner, and I'm going to</i>

09:21.455 --> 09:23.269
<i>use this as my slop basket.</i>

09:23.392 --> 09:25.394
- <i>Are we good?</i>
- <i>Ugh.</i>

09:28.872 --> 09:30.873
Ah, this is relaxing.

09:31.332 --> 09:32.265
Knew you'd like it.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.566
I don't know why you
continue to do that.

09:33.568 --> 09:35.268
Just making it weird.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.136
What is wrong with a man
holding a man's hand?

09:37.138 --> 09:38.003
Nothing, here.

09:38.005 --> 09:38.571
Nothing wrong.

09:38.573 --> 09:40.373
Show everybody that you're
totally fine with it.

09:40.375 --> 09:41.307
Sure, okay.

09:41.309 --> 09:42.775
Oh, ow! God...!

09:42.777 --> 09:43.809
No, this is what you wanted.

09:43.811 --> 09:44.543
Stop, stop!

09:44.545 --> 09:46.011
You want comfort and connection.

09:46.013 --> 09:46.979
Ow!

09:46.981 --> 09:49.582
Happy?

09:49.584 --> 09:51.551
Do you have to sit
so close, Andre?

09:51.553 --> 09:54.153
If your foot touches mine,
I'm going to cut it off.

09:54.155 --> 09:55.554
I'm having a lot of fun.

09:55.556 --> 09:57.156
Told you. Yeah.

09:57.158 --> 10:00.593
And we haven't even touched the tip of
the iceberg yet, with the treatments.

10:00.595 --> 10:01.861
You know what I heard?

10:01.863 --> 10:04.664
They even have a treatment where
guys will come in to get their

10:04.666 --> 10:06.032
pubic area dyed.

10:06.034 --> 10:06.966
Did you ever hear about that?

10:06.968 --> 10:07.967
Oh, yeah.

10:07.969 --> 10:09.336
A little too fruity for me.

10:09.338 --> 10:10.303
I mean, God.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.304
Oh.

10:11.306 --> 10:12.606
How desperate would
you have to be?

10:12.608 --> 10:13.607
God!

10:13.609 --> 10:14.541
To get your pubes dyed.

10:14.543 --> 10:16.042
So desperate.

10:16.044 --> 10:17.044
Isn't this great?

10:17.046 --> 10:17.611
It feels good.

10:17.613 --> 10:18.511
Yeah.

10:18.513 --> 10:19.612
Tightens the pores.

10:19.614 --> 10:23.316
This coming from a man who's used
to having gook on their face.

10:23.318 --> 10:25.351
Okay, it was my own gook.

10:25.353 --> 10:26.352
What?

10:26.354 --> 10:27.353
To get rid of zits.

10:27.355 --> 10:30.089
You put, you know, stuff
on your face, you know?

10:30.091 --> 10:31.023
What stuff?

10:31.025 --> 10:32.859
I churn some butter and
I put it on my face.

10:32.861 --> 10:34.827
Do you ever swallow
your own spit?

10:34.829 --> 10:35.995
It's the same idea.

10:35.997 --> 10:38.030
It's the same idea as spit.

10:38.032 --> 10:40.032
It's dick spit-- come on!

10:45.306 --> 10:46.239
Taco?

10:46.241 --> 10:47.173
Hey, Jenny.

10:47.175 --> 10:48.408
What are you doing?

10:48.410 --> 10:50.543
I'm making a pee bib
underwear prototype.

10:50.545 --> 10:52.111
I need some raw materials.

10:52.113 --> 10:55.248
And you're not using your
own underwear because...?

10:55.250 --> 10:58.552
Mm...
You don't have any underwear.

10:58.554 --> 10:59.586
Never saw the point.

10:59.588 --> 11:00.587
Right.

11:00.589 --> 11:02.590
Could you at least go
through our clean laundry?

11:02.592 --> 11:04.025
I thought that's what this was.

11:04.027 --> 11:05.026
No.

11:05.028 --> 11:08.296
Whoa, is this a white pube?

11:08.298 --> 11:09.364
No.

11:09.366 --> 11:11.967
I knew you were old, but I didn't...
It's not mine!

11:11.969 --> 11:13.569
Kevin has white pubes?

11:13.571 --> 11:15.538
No.

11:15.540 --> 11:16.572
Taco!

11:16.574 --> 11:18.974
Do not say a word about this.

11:18.976 --> 11:23.811
Promise me, Taco, you
will not say anything!

11:23.813 --> 11:27.047
No.

11:27.049 --> 11:29.383
Oh!

11:30.385 --> 11:33.120
...most enriching experience...
...Intercontinental

11:33.122 --> 11:35.488
heavyweight boxing title
is on the line in Vegas.

11:35.490 --> 11:39.326
Sammy Sterling weighs in 212...
Pee bib, huh?

11:39.328 --> 11:41.628
He has a two inch reach...

11:43.064 --> 11:44.264
Ruxin!

11:44.266 --> 11:45.499
Jesus, Raffi!

11:45.501 --> 11:46.633
Why don't you lock the door?

11:46.635 --> 11:47.634
I don't lock doors.

11:47.636 --> 11:49.169
It's rude. Up top!

11:49.171 --> 11:50.337
I'm not touching you.

11:50.339 --> 11:51.305
Come on, bro, high five.

11:51.307 --> 11:52.072
Don't leave me hanging.

11:52.074 --> 11:53.573
No, I just need to
go to the bathroom.

11:53.575 --> 11:54.441
All right-- come on in.

11:54.443 --> 11:55.175
Go between my legs.

11:55.177 --> 11:56.176
What?!

11:56.178 --> 11:56.843
How's your aim?

11:56.845 --> 11:57.577
No, I got to go number two.

11:57.579 --> 11:59.579
Okay, then just
come sit on my lap.

11:59.581 --> 12:01.581
We can double drop a deuce
like we did in college.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.417
You didn't go to college, Raffi.

12:03.419 --> 12:04.551
So, lots of people
didn't go to college.

12:04.553 --> 12:05.919
You don't have to constantly
throw it in my face.

12:05.921 --> 12:07.521
I'm sorry for interrupting you.

12:07.523 --> 12:08.989
You're watching it
happen right now.

12:08.991 --> 12:09.856
Oh, God.

12:09.858 --> 12:11.992
Hey, man, do you
want to hang out?

12:11.994 --> 12:14.094
Have you been enjoying
having sex in my house?

12:14.096 --> 12:17.531
Ashley and I have had a great time
defiling little Casa de Ruxin.

12:17.533 --> 12:19.666
But at this point, I only have
one thing left to do-- and that

12:19.668 --> 12:22.470
is figure out what
the golden gate is.

12:22.472 --> 12:23.337
Hey, guys!

12:23.339 --> 12:24.338
What's going on?

12:24.340 --> 12:24.839
Hey, Kevin.

12:24.841 --> 12:26.607
Um, you look weird.

12:26.609 --> 12:28.176
Why's your skin all oily?

12:28.178 --> 12:29.611
It's the lactic acid facial.

12:29.613 --> 12:32.814
Facial?

12:32.816 --> 12:34.516
Okay.

12:34.518 --> 12:37.552
Be that as it may, my friend
Kevin and I had a spa day.

12:37.554 --> 12:40.822
We had a full gamut of treatments, including
a mani-pedi-- show him your nails.

12:40.824 --> 12:41.557
I'm not.

12:41.559 --> 12:44.026
You look like a china
doll of Kevin.

12:44.028 --> 12:45.493
What's going on there?

12:45.495 --> 12:46.961
Did you wax your eyebrows?

12:46.963 --> 12:47.962
No.

12:47.964 --> 12:49.463
Yes, finally.

12:49.465 --> 12:50.231
Look at this.

12:50.233 --> 12:51.231
Olga worked her magic on him.

12:51.233 --> 12:55.001
She trimmed, she tightened, she dyed--
I mean, it's like a brand-new Kevin.

12:55.003 --> 12:56.570
Wow.

12:56.572 --> 12:58.572
Any treatments for
old smoke crotch?

12:58.574 --> 12:59.506
Excuse me?

12:59.508 --> 13:01.842
What about Casper
the Friendly Pube?

13:01.844 --> 13:02.576
Was he there?

13:02.578 --> 13:05.879
No, he was out in the
Gray Gardens, actually.

13:05.881 --> 13:06.580
The Gray Gardens?

13:06.582 --> 13:07.581
You do have a white pube.

13:07.583 --> 13:10.050
No, I don't have a white pube.

13:10.052 --> 13:12.853
All right, if you must
know, I got a mani-pedi.

13:12.855 --> 13:14.855
I got a volcano hair treatment.

13:14.857 --> 13:16.524
And yes, I did get a brow wax.

13:16.526 --> 13:20.528
But I do not have a white pube that
requires any white pube treatments.

13:20.530 --> 13:21.528
So, they're all red?

13:21.530 --> 13:23.063
They're not red, Ruxin.

13:23.065 --> 13:24.097
Oh, they're gray.

13:24.099 --> 13:26.066
They're not... gray.

13:26.068 --> 13:27.068
Come on, Kevin.

13:27.070 --> 13:29.003
Where there was fire, there's smoke...
crotch.

13:29.005 --> 13:29.870
You know what?

13:29.872 --> 13:30.504
Good day, guys.

13:30.506 --> 13:31.271
Thank you very much.

13:31.273 --> 13:32.272
Kevin, do not get upset.

13:32.274 --> 13:35.542
Remember what Olga said
about your frown lines.

13:36.611 --> 13:38.345
Oh, my God.

13:38.347 --> 13:40.548
(moaning)

13:40.550 --> 13:41.615
Hi.

13:41.617 --> 13:44.919
Hi, how was that
for a golden gate?

13:44.921 --> 13:48.522
That was amazing, but it
wasn't a golden gate.

13:48.524 --> 13:49.390
Really?

13:49.392 --> 13:51.292
You don't know what
a golden gate is?

13:51.294 --> 13:54.128
It's not, like, when you have sex
and then jump off a bridge, is it?

13:54.130 --> 13:54.862
No.

13:54.864 --> 13:55.530
Okay.

13:55.532 --> 13:56.931
I mean, do you want
me to show you?

13:56.933 --> 13:57.765
Yeah.

13:57.767 --> 13:58.799
Are you sure?

13:58.801 --> 14:00.935
I'm game to try
anything with you.

14:00.937 --> 14:01.569
Okay.

14:01.571 --> 14:04.304
Yeah, let's have some fun.

14:04.306 --> 14:07.207
Okay, where are you going?

14:07.209 --> 14:09.475
I just, I got to get ready.

14:09.477 --> 14:10.777
Okay.

14:10.779 --> 14:12.478
Are we getting props, or...?

14:12.480 --> 14:13.312
Sort of.

14:13.314 --> 14:14.280
All right.

14:14.282 --> 14:16.816
Golden gate.

14:16.818 --> 14:18.085
Hi.

14:18.087 --> 14:19.553
What are you hiding?

14:19.555 --> 14:21.588
What is that?

14:21.590 --> 14:23.257
Oh!

14:23.259 --> 14:24.559
Oil stuff.

14:24.561 --> 14:25.593
It's massage oil.

14:25.595 --> 14:28.263
Oh, okay, I know what that is.

14:28.265 --> 14:28.930
Heard of it?

14:28.932 --> 14:30.065
Yes, I know that stuff.

14:30.067 --> 14:31.300
Okay.

14:31.302 --> 14:33.836
Just want to relax
you a little bit.

14:33.838 --> 14:35.438
Oh, I feel relaxed.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.240
For the golden gate?

14:37.242 --> 14:38.941
For the golden gate, yes.

14:38.943 --> 14:41.010
Is, I mean, is this it?

14:41.012 --> 14:41.944
Have we started?

14:41.946 --> 14:43.446
First, close your eyes.

14:43.448 --> 14:45.948
Okay.

14:45.950 --> 14:48.617
All right, that feels good.

14:48.619 --> 14:49.619
Mmm.

14:49.621 --> 14:50.620
That's better.

14:50.622 --> 14:51.555
Mm-hmm.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.823
I like the Bay Area.

14:52.825 --> 14:53.557
This is good.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.926
This is going to be nice.

14:55.928 --> 14:57.094
Uh, oh, sneaky fingers.

14:57.096 --> 14:58.495
Look out.

14:58.497 --> 15:00.163
Look out.

15:00.165 --> 15:02.532
Raffi, what are you doing?

15:02.534 --> 15:03.532
Hey, tall guy.

15:03.534 --> 15:04.867
What-what are you doing here?

15:04.869 --> 15:06.269
We're building a bridge.

15:06.271 --> 15:07.470
No, we're building a bridge.

15:07.472 --> 15:08.938
Just a two-person bridge.

15:08.940 --> 15:10.339
We're all building a bridge.

15:10.341 --> 15:11.207
He's helping.

15:11.209 --> 15:13.275
I think... Do you want her
mouth or her downstairs, man?

15:13.277 --> 15:15.277
You get one side,
I get the other.

15:15.279 --> 15:15.944
No.

15:15.946 --> 15:17.012
Two sides of the bridge.

15:17.014 --> 15:18.380
No, not this bridge.

15:18.382 --> 15:19.848
Just relax, just relax.

15:19.850 --> 15:20.783
Too much hair on the bridge.

15:20.785 --> 15:24.454
It's a hairy bridge. I don't-- Dude, and
I dyed my pubes white like Brian's.

15:24.456 --> 15:26.390
So, my dick is terrifying.

15:26.392 --> 15:27.958
Okay, I'm good, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

15:27.960 --> 15:28.859
Tall guy, what are you doing?

15:28.861 --> 15:30.060
Sorry, sorry.

15:30.062 --> 15:31.195
I just... Hey!

15:31.197 --> 15:33.063
Look, no...
There's no golden gating.

15:33.065 --> 15:34.198
I hate San Francisco.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.466
I'm dropping Vernon Davis.

15:36.468 --> 15:38.602
Okay.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.037
What a weirdo.

15:40.039 --> 15:41.505
Why did he act so strange?

15:41.507 --> 15:44.307
I bet when I got here and
climbed on top, he came,

15:44.309 --> 15:46.209
and he got really
embarrassed, so he left.

15:46.211 --> 15:48.212
What a waste.

15:51.149 --> 15:53.150
I'm not going to
take it anymore.

15:53.152 --> 15:55.219
They're not going
to make fun of me.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.387
I'm just like them.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.488
I'm young.

15:57.490 --> 15:58.756
I can do this.

15:58.758 --> 16:02.260
I'm a man, and I'm not
taking it anymore.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.561
Is this for vaginas?

16:03.563 --> 16:05.263
Well, close enough.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.565
Okay.

16:07.567 --> 16:08.833
(knocking)

16:08.835 --> 16:09.567
Sweetie?

16:09.569 --> 16:10.568
What? Huh?

16:10.570 --> 16:11.436
Are you okay?

16:11.438 --> 16:12.570
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.571
I'm on the toilet, babe.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.173
It's complicated.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.073
You're disgusting.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.108
I love you. Good luck.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.544
Okay.

16:20.546 --> 16:22.913
Good-bye, grandpa crotch.

16:26.651 --> 16:30.587
Your au pair is literally a filth
monger and you can have her-- I'm done.

16:30.589 --> 16:33.323
I already heard all the details
because Raffi broke into

16:33.325 --> 16:35.659
the shower while I was in there,
told me the story, and then,

16:35.661 --> 16:38.028
purely based off instinct,
tried to shiv me.

16:38.030 --> 16:40.497
Trust me, there is nothing
golden about the golden gate,

16:40.499 --> 16:42.565
especially when Raffi
is Marin County.

16:42.567 --> 16:43.300
Hey, guys.

16:43.302 --> 16:45.970
Ruxin, I need to talk
business with you.

16:45.972 --> 16:49.607
Taco Corps is thinking of investing heavily
in the pee bib, and as my lawyer...

16:49.609 --> 16:50.608
I'm not your lawyer.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.445
As my attorney, I really need
to discuss patent law with you.

16:53.447 --> 16:54.979
I ran some product tests.

16:54.981 --> 16:59.750
Basically, I peed on myself, and 97%
of the time, the pee bib worked.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.987
Unless I had an erection because then it
would pee upwards and on to my chest,

17:02.989 --> 17:06.557
which if that happens, then
I could make a pee vest.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.126
And it would protect your
chest from the chest pee.

17:09.127 --> 17:10.060
Write that down.

17:10.061 --> 17:11.228
Just did.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.162
And pee socks.

17:12.164 --> 17:13.864
There could be pee socks, when
you're peeing in the middle

17:13.866 --> 17:15.566
of the night, and pee
splashes all over your feet.

17:15.568 --> 17:16.566
Write that down again.

17:16.568 --> 17:17.401
Already e-mailed it.

17:17.403 --> 17:18.569
Oh, a pee helmet.

17:18.570 --> 17:19.903
No, that's a stupid idea.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.137
Leave the ideas
to the idea man.

17:22.140 --> 17:24.773
I told you not to bring your
friends to our business meetings.

17:24.776 --> 17:25.575
He showed up.

17:25.577 --> 17:26.474
I apologize.

17:26.477 --> 17:27.944
Well, I'm putting the cart
before the horse here.

17:27.945 --> 17:29.578
Let's focus on the
pee bib first.

17:29.580 --> 17:31.180
Here are the prototypes.

17:31.182 --> 17:32.247
Look at that.

17:32.249 --> 17:32.948
Looks good, huh?

17:32.950 --> 17:35.451
All you do is cross out Kevin
and Jenny and write pee bib.

17:35.453 --> 17:39.021
Yeah, in the focus groups, the Kevin and
Jenny stuff did not play well at all.

17:39.023 --> 17:40.590
Well, at least you already
trademarked it-- that's good.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.192
No, it's Taco-marked.

17:42.194 --> 17:44.194
Oh, we need to
trademark Taco-mark.

17:44.196 --> 17:46.162
You sure you don't want me
to Taco-mark Taco-mark?

17:46.164 --> 17:47.030
Even better.

17:47.032 --> 17:49.300
Taco! Are those all
my wedding napkins?

17:49.302 --> 17:50.200
Not anymore.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.101
Speak to my lawyer.

17:51.103 --> 17:53.771
Where is your old, old,
decrepit husband?

17:53.773 --> 17:54.939
He's in the bathroom.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.607
I thought he only locked himself
in the bathroom when he

17:56.609 --> 17:57.541
was home alone with you.

17:57.543 --> 17:58.342
He doesn't do that.

17:58.344 --> 17:59.310
Anymore.

17:59.312 --> 17:59.977
Okay.

17:59.979 --> 18:00.511
Okay?

18:00.513 --> 18:00.978
Yeah.

18:00.980 --> 18:01.545
All right.

18:01.547 --> 18:03.981
Mm! Not bad.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.816
Still damp.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.852
Guys, can you just be a little
sensitive when you are

18:08.854 --> 18:12.556
talking to him about
his graying nethers?

18:12.558 --> 18:13.824
Okay? He's having a tough time.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.026
All right, we'll...
No problem, Jen.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.295
All right, and if you guys want
anything, just get it yourself.

18:18.297 --> 18:19.029
I'm done with you.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.297
We'll take care of him.

18:20.299 --> 18:21.298
Hey, Smokey the Crotch!

18:21.300 --> 18:22.032
Come on down!

18:22.034 --> 18:24.568
Hey, does your dick need a
walker to get down the stairs?

18:24.570 --> 18:25.569
Hey, Santa Cock!

18:25.571 --> 18:27.404
You dreaming of white Dickmas?

18:27.406 --> 18:28.038
Come down!

18:28.040 --> 18:28.906
All right.

18:28.908 --> 18:29.840
Hang on, okay?

18:29.842 --> 18:30.907
I'll be down in a minute.

18:30.909 --> 18:34.177
Hey, when you die, is your dick going
to live alone with a bunch of cats?

18:34.179 --> 18:35.312
Just leave me alone, okay?!

18:35.314 --> 18:36.079
Give me five minutes!

18:36.081 --> 18:37.380
It's my house!

18:37.382 --> 18:39.516
I need this.

18:39.518 --> 18:41.885
Come on, hurry it
up, Rip Van Tinkle.

18:41.887 --> 18:43.319
What is taking so long?

18:43.321 --> 18:45.154
Are you using a hair dryer?

18:45.156 --> 18:46.522
You getting ready for prom?

18:46.524 --> 18:49.525
No, I'm not using a hair
dryer, if you must know.

18:49.527 --> 18:53.528
I am vacuuming because I am a
responsible member of my... Oh! Oh! Oh!

18:53.530 --> 18:54.395
Pubes on fire!

18:54.397 --> 18:55.162
My pubes on fire!

18:55.164 --> 18:56.163
Pubes on fire! Aah!

18:56.165 --> 18:57.064
Holy crap!

18:57.066 --> 18:59.500
Oh, whoa!

19:01.336 --> 19:02.336
Aah! Fire crotch!

19:02.338 --> 19:03.371
Fire crotch! It's burning!

19:03.373 --> 19:04.839
It's burning! Put it out!

19:04.841 --> 19:05.540
Do something!

19:05.542 --> 19:06.174
Put it out!

19:06.176 --> 19:06.774
Put it out, Andre!

19:06.776 --> 19:07.842
Put it out, put it out!

19:07.844 --> 19:10.245
Oh, put it out!

19:10.365 --> 19:11.494
I'm sorry.

19:11.614 --> 19:12.848
Oh, no!

19:12.850 --> 19:14.216
The pee bib will save you!

19:14.218 --> 19:15.084
What did you do?

19:15.086 --> 19:16.085
I'm so sorry-- it slipped!

19:16.087 --> 19:17.666
Why is his dick on fire?

19:17.786 --> 19:18.618
It wasn't me.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.757
Oh, no, my inventory's ruined.

19:20.877 --> 19:23.007
Ruxin, I'm going to
have to let you go.

19:23.127 --> 19:24.942
Ah, you win some, you lose some.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.292
I love football at this house.

19:29.109 --> 19:32.952
(both moaning, sighing)

19:33.256 --> 19:36.432
Oh! I feel like I
just got milked.

19:36.778 --> 19:39.210
Thank you, by the way, for
not making me wear a condom.

19:40.124 --> 19:41.388
That was pretty (bleep) classy.

19:41.508 --> 19:43.508
Ashley, can you please
come down here?

19:43.510 --> 19:44.810
Ugh.

19:44.812 --> 19:46.511
He is the worst.

19:46.513 --> 19:47.846
I want to quit so bad.

19:47.848 --> 19:48.513
You should quit.

19:48.515 --> 19:49.815
- I can't.
- You should quit.

19:49.817 --> 19:51.516
- I can't.
- Why?

19:51.518 --> 19:53.318
Because, where would I live?

19:53.320 --> 19:55.053
You should stay here with me.

19:55.055 --> 19:56.088
In my room.

19:56.090 --> 19:56.821
No, hear me out.

19:56.941 --> 19:59.068
Yes, we just met yesterday, but...

19:59.432 --> 20:01.119
we have a real connection.

20:01.239 --> 20:02.255
So I'm asking you.

20:04.130 --> 20:05.314
- Ashley.
- Ashley...

20:06.093 --> 20:07.558
Will you come live with me?

20:09.227 --> 20:11.524
- You really gonna do this, Ashley?
- Mm-hmm, I quit.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.652
You're gonna love living here.

20:14.772 --> 20:17.389
Raffi, I won't let that happen
under my roof.

20:19.244 --> 20:20.205
Hey, babe.

20:20.325 --> 20:22.419
- How was the vacation?
- What is going on?

20:22.539 --> 20:23.181
Nothing.

20:24.676 --> 20:26.223
***

20:27.118 --> 20:29.321
Who is my brother having
sex in our house?

20:29.732 --> 20:30.833
With Ashley.

20:32.157 --> 20:34.126
Raffi is having sex with our au-pair?

20:34.246 --> 20:36.270
Technically she's not our au-pair anymore.
She quit.

20:36.390 --> 20:37.289
What? You...

20:37.409 --> 20:39.534
- ***.
- Baby, I wouldn't go in there.

20:41.445 --> 20:44.269
God. Oh my God.

20:45.042 --> 20:46.821
