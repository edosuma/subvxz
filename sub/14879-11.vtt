13:07.120 --> 13:08.520
You were
a little bit wobbly.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.122
I tried to take you home,

13:10.190 --> 13:14.159
but you became very adamant
about me not seeing it.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.961
You are married, yes?

13:16.029 --> 13:17.262
No.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.832
You live
with someone, then?

13:19.899 --> 13:21.133
No.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.202
Um, where are my pants?

13:28.908 --> 13:30.843
[Grunts softly]

13:30.910 --> 13:32.811
You took them off yourself.

13:32.879 --> 13:34.847
Like I said,
stay as long as you like.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.315
Just, uh, do me a favor

13:36.382 --> 13:38.250
and tell the doorman downstairs
that you're leaving,

13:38.318 --> 13:40.252
so he can lock up.
Okay.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.988
And eat the omelet.
It's good for the hangover.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.124
<i>Adios.</i>

13:48.862 --> 13:50.596
How was dinner last night?

13:50.663 --> 13:52.531
I hear the octopus
is sensational.

13:52.599 --> 13:53.899
How did you--

13:53.967 --> 13:55.901
Our friends at the C.N.I.
took this.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.970
You realize operatives
are not permitted

13:58.037 --> 13:59.238
to date foreigners,
don't you?

13:59.305 --> 14:00.773
I--this is not
what it looks like.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.242
And why is Spanish intelligence
following me?

14:03.309 --> 14:04.610
They weren't.
They were following him.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.978
Zavier Etxarte.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.246
Why?
He's a chef.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.081
He's a former member
of the E.T.A., Annie--

14:09.149 --> 14:10.582
a Basque separatist.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.785
And he's still in contact
with suspected terrorists.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.086
Terrorists?
Zavier?

14:14.154 --> 14:16.054
You wanted to know
what's next?

14:16.122 --> 14:18.891
Well, this is it.
Zavier is your new op.

14:24.349 --> 14:27.978
It's a tale of two brothers.
Zavier and Gorka Etxarte.

14:28.151 --> 14:30.486
They joined
the <i>Euskadi Ta Askatasuna</i>

14:30.554 --> 14:32.955
together at the ages
of 18 and 16 respectively.

14:33.023 --> 14:35.090
In 2003, a cell
of ETA terrorists

14:35.158 --> 14:37.159
was rounded up in connection
with the kidnapping

14:37.227 --> 14:39.562
of a provincial government
official.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.998
Gorka was convicted
of conspiracy to commit murder.

14:43.066 --> 14:45.434
Zavier was arrested
but never charged.

14:45.502 --> 14:47.470
He emigrated
to the states in 2005,

14:47.537 --> 14:49.238
found his new calling
in the kitchen,

14:49.306 --> 14:51.807
and decided to open
his own restaurant here in D.C.

14:51.875 --> 14:53.542
just one month ago.

14:53.610 --> 14:56.045
And just two blocks away
from the Spanish embassy.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.646
Precisely.

14:57.714 --> 14:59.315
C.N.I. believe that's exactly
why he chose that location.

14:59.382 --> 15:01.951
- What about Gorka?
- That's kind of why we're here.

15:02.018 --> 15:04.019
Gorka was released from prison
three weeks ago.

15:04.087 --> 15:06.722
C.N.I. has been monitoring
his activities in Bilbao.

15:06.790 --> 15:08.791
ETA's never been shy
about calling their shots.

15:08.859 --> 15:10.159
Has the embassy received
any threats?

15:10.227 --> 15:11.794
No, but Basque Soldier's Day

15:11.862 --> 15:13.929
is being commemorated
later this week.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.297
Historically,
the Spanish have seen

15:15.365 --> 15:16.699
an uptick
in violent activity.

15:16.766 --> 15:19.001
I thought ETA declared
a permanent cease-fire.

15:19.069 --> 15:21.937
Yep, for the third time
this decade.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.439
Auggie, I want you
to put together a team

15:23.507 --> 15:25.040
to sift through
Zavier's restaurant--

15:25.108 --> 15:27.910
his employees, his purveyors,
his customers, and investors.

15:27.978 --> 15:30.446
Follow the money,
and don't even think about lunch

15:30.514 --> 15:31.947
until I get a status report.

15:32.015 --> 15:35.117
Lunch?
You'll have it by brunch.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.453
Annie, I want you
to stick close to Zavier.

15:37.521 --> 15:39.121
See what, if anything,
pops up,

15:39.189 --> 15:40.523
at least
through the holiday.

15:40.590 --> 15:41.857
Uh, Joan, I'm sorry,
but, uh--

15:41.925 --> 15:43.092
You know,
that's not what I like to hear

15:43.159 --> 15:44.460
after giving a directive.

15:44.528 --> 15:46.328
I realize that.
However, um...

15:46.396 --> 15:47.897
I just wasn't clear
about the directive.

15:47.964 --> 15:49.398
"Stick close to Zavier"?

15:49.466 --> 15:53.502
He works, like, 30 hours a day
in a really busy restaurant.

15:53.570 --> 15:55.104
The only time I could see him
would be late, late at night.

15:55.171 --> 15:56.872
So what's the problem?

15:56.940 --> 15:58.908
The problem is...

15:58.975 --> 16:02.177
You know, Latin men.

16:02.245 --> 16:03.812
Not as well as you do,
apparently.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.381
If I go back
to see him tonight,

16:05.448 --> 16:06.949
he's going to assume
I intend to sleep with him.

16:07.017 --> 16:08.951
Let's be perfectly clear.

16:09.019 --> 16:11.554
I'm not asking you
to sleep with anyone.

16:11.621 --> 16:15.291
I'm asking you to locate
and assess a potential threat.

16:15.358 --> 16:18.294
How you do that
is up to you.

16:29.706 --> 16:31.006
Larry, do you mind?

16:31.074 --> 16:33.776
I need a little bonding time
with my son here.

16:38.848 --> 16:41.283
You can't possibly be
this obtuse.

16:41.351 --> 16:43.185
Dad, I really don't want
to talk about this here.

16:43.253 --> 16:47.356
You ask--
<i>ask</i> to be deposed?

16:47.424 --> 16:48.857
How could you know that?

16:48.925 --> 16:50.559
Do you think
blowing your little whistle

16:50.627 --> 16:52.962
is gonna gain you favor
in the Agency?

16:53.029 --> 16:54.663
The people
slapping your back today

16:54.731 --> 16:58.100
for being so honest
and forthright

16:58.168 --> 17:00.436
will be the same ones
who won't share

17:00.503 --> 17:01.971
another piece
of information with you

17:02.038 --> 17:05.040
because they know now
you like to talk.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.209
I didn't expect you
to understand.

17:07.277 --> 17:09.979
I get it.
You're frustrated.

17:10.046 --> 17:12.047
Arthur shut you out,

17:12.115 --> 17:15.951
and I'm not in position yet
to be there for you.

17:16.019 --> 17:18.954
- If you can just sit tight...
- Come on.

17:19.021 --> 17:22.458
For a little more time,
it's all going to work out.

17:22.525 --> 17:25.394
But if you finger me
as the leak--

17:25.462 --> 17:28.964
You think I want to do this...
to my own father?

17:29.032 --> 17:31.367
Don't put yourself
in that position, son.

17:31.434 --> 17:34.003
I don't have a choice.

17:34.070 --> 17:36.171
Our national security
has been compromised.

17:36.239 --> 17:38.841
I'm just trying to do my part
to repair the breach...

17:38.908 --> 17:41.443
For my country
and my conscience.

17:41.511 --> 17:43.679
For your country
and conscience?

17:43.747 --> 17:45.114
Who talks like that?

17:45.181 --> 17:47.216
Did you not learn
anything from me?

17:47.283 --> 17:48.951
I guess not.

17:49.019 --> 17:51.220
It's hard
to believe sometimes

17:51.287 --> 17:54.890
you're actually
my son.

18:05.702 --> 18:07.770
I'm warning you,
I'm no Julia Child.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.973
You don't have to be
for this.

18:11.041 --> 18:14.043
Thanks again for showing me
how to make the eggs.

18:14.110 --> 18:17.312
You had a craving.
I understand.

18:17.380 --> 18:19.281
I'm not keeping you
from anything, am I?

18:19.349 --> 18:21.450
At 1:00 in the morning, no.

18:25.689 --> 18:27.222
I'm all yours.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.829
- That's it?
- That's it.

18:33.897 --> 18:35.297
Now we just need
to figure out

18:35.365 --> 18:38.100
how to kill
half an hour.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.804
What's this?

18:41.871 --> 18:45.107
This is me
covering up a big mistake.

18:45.175 --> 18:47.776
I made some bad decisions
when I was young.

18:47.844 --> 18:48.977
How bad?

18:49.045 --> 18:51.046
Bad enough to co me
a year of freedom.

18:51.114 --> 18:53.749
That's where I learned
how to cook, actually...

18:53.817 --> 18:56.385
In prison.
[Chuckles]

18:56.453 --> 18:58.120
You can run away in horror now,
if you like.

18:58.188 --> 19:00.589
I understand.

19:00.657 --> 19:03.892
No.
I'm okay.

19:05.995 --> 19:08.464
That's what I like most
about being a chef.

19:08.531 --> 19:13.068
Every day I get to make
a thousand small decisions--

19:13.136 --> 19:17.873
what pan to use, how much salt,
how much flame.

19:17.941 --> 19:21.577
And I can make
the right ones.

19:21.644 --> 19:25.914
I can actually taste
when I make the right decision.

19:25.982 --> 19:28.283
Alone, none of them
can make up for the past.

19:28.351 --> 19:31.920
But all together,
it's a start.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.458
I forgot something.

19:36.526 --> 19:38.494
Not the Izarra.

19:38.561 --> 19:42.197
No, uh, creme fraiche.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.767
I'll be right back.

19:55.211 --> 19:56.578
[Corks pops]

19:56.646 --> 19:58.647
[Man whistles]

[Speaking Basque]

20:02.719 --> 20:04.753
Oh!

20:04.821 --> 20:07.256
I didn't know
you had company.

20:07.323 --> 20:09.525
Uh, Annie,
this is my--

20:09.592 --> 20:13.061
Juan, an old friend.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.563
<i>Hola.</i>
I'm Annie.

20:14.631 --> 20:16.965
Hi.
So nice to meet you.

20:17.033 --> 20:19.601
So I should get another glass.
We're celebrating...

20:19.669 --> 20:21.837
Old acquaintances
and, uh, new friends.

20:21.905 --> 20:23.305
No.
No, no, that's okay.

20:23.373 --> 20:24.773
No, you should try it.
I brought a couple of cases.

20:24.841 --> 20:26.642
It's Cava from Catalonia.
It's really, really nice.

20:26.709 --> 20:30.646
You'd like it.

20:30.713 --> 20:32.881
Uh, you know, I should leave
you guys alone to catch up.

20:32.949 --> 20:34.183
I think that's a good idea.

20:34.250 --> 20:36.752
No, no. You shouldn't,
uh, not on my account.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.587
Any friend of Zavier
is a friend of mine.

20:38.655 --> 20:39.955
[Chuckles]

20:47.630 --> 20:49.198
I'm sorry
for the interruption.

20:49.265 --> 20:51.400
But, uh,
get your purse,

20:51.467 --> 20:54.203
and we can continue this lesson
some other time?

20:54.270 --> 20:57.472
Of course.
Bye, Juan.

20:57.540 --> 21:00.576
So nice to meet you.
<i>Vaya con dios,</i> Annie.

21:06.216 --> 21:08.350
The brother who just
got out of jail...

21:08.418 --> 21:10.485
- Yeah?
- He's not in Bilbao anymore.

21:10.553 --> 21:13.388
[Alarm clock beeping]

21:19.329 --> 21:22.197
[Sighs]

21:25.335 --> 21:27.736
[Cell phone beeps]

21:27.804 --> 21:29.304
Hello, Sunshine.
How's the safe house?

21:29.372 --> 21:31.006
Feeling safe?

21:31.074 --> 21:33.442
I now know why nobody sleeps
on a futon after college.

21:33.509 --> 21:36.345
[Chuckles]
Rough night's sleep, huh?

21:36.412 --> 21:38.914
I started making a list
of the things I realize I need.

21:38.982 --> 21:41.216
I need a bed.
I need a microwave.

21:41.284 --> 21:43.085
And I need a bottle opener.

21:43.152 --> 21:44.820
I really need
a bottle opener.

21:44.888 --> 21:47.089
You definitely need
a bottle opener.

21:47.156 --> 21:48.790
Where are we at
with Gorka?

21:48.858 --> 21:50.893
Well, we're making progress.
Garcia trailed

21:50.960 --> 21:53.695
the brothers back to
Zavier's apartment last night.

21:53.763 --> 21:56.465
Zavier left at 5:30
for the produce market.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.433
Gorka set off
about ten minutes ago

21:58.501 --> 22:01.103
with two unidentified men
of Spanish origin.

22:01.170 --> 22:03.238
And it appears that
they're casing the embassy

22:03.306 --> 22:04.740
and possible escape routes.

22:04.807 --> 22:07.309
Did, uh, Gorka
have his bag with him?

22:07.377 --> 22:08.510
What bag?

22:08.578 --> 22:10.078
Gorka had a duffel bag
when he came

22:10.146 --> 22:12.981
into the restaurant last night.
Is it on him?

22:13.049 --> 22:15.951
Hold on a second.

22:16.019 --> 22:18.954
He does not have the bag
with him in the car.

22:19.022 --> 22:20.555
I bet it's
in Zavier's apartment.

22:20.623 --> 22:22.257
Okay. I'm setting up
a cleaning crew

22:22.325 --> 22:24.026
to go in
and search for it now.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.294
I can do it.
I know the layout.

22:25.361 --> 22:26.795
No.
That is a negatory, Annie.

22:26.863 --> 22:28.430
That is
too compromising.

22:28.498 --> 22:30.065
I-I'm five minutes out,
and I have a way in.

22:30.133 --> 22:33.335
Do you have a better plan?
[Sighs]

22:37.774 --> 22:39.308
You remember me
from the other day?

22:39.375 --> 22:41.410
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

22:41.477 --> 22:43.278
Listen, I could really use
your help with something.

22:43.346 --> 22:45.480
I need to get
into Mr. Etxarte's apartment.

22:45.548 --> 22:49.318
Uh, you can call Mr. Z
and have him give me the okay.

22:49.385 --> 22:52.120
It's kind of embarrassing,
actually.

22:52.188 --> 22:54.923
I left my ring upstairs...

22:54.991 --> 22:59.127
The ring my husband gave me
when we got married.

22:59.195 --> 23:01.063
- Here you go.
- I will just be a minute.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.531
Uh, no.
I'm coming in with you too.

23:02.598 --> 23:04.933
Oh, Mr. Vahidi,
could you help me, please?

23:05.001 --> 23:06.835
My cable's out again.

23:06.903 --> 23:10.339
I'll be right back.
[Clears throat]

you clear out of there.

23:59.288 --> 24:01.890
Annie, I need you
to wrap things up in there.

24:01.958 --> 24:04.526
Okay, just a second.
I'm almost finished.

24:04.594 --> 24:06.661
We lost our visual
on Gorka.

24:11.034 --> 24:13.068
I found it--

24:21.532 --> 24:24.734
[Chuckles]

24:24.802 --> 24:27.570
Hi.
Annie, right?

24:27.638 --> 24:28.872
Right.

24:31.909 --> 24:34.310
What are you doing here,
Annie?

24:34.378 --> 24:37.447
I forgot my ring,
but I found it.

24:37.515 --> 24:40.650
Does Zavier know
you're here?

24:40.718 --> 24:42.652
I didn't want
to bother him.

24:42.720 --> 24:45.321
Yes, Zavier doesn't like
to be bothered,

24:45.389 --> 24:46.956
so it would probably
be best like this.

24:47.024 --> 24:49.192
It's embarrassing enough.
I should probably go.

24:49.260 --> 24:51.961
Have we met before,
Annie?

24:52.029 --> 24:53.496
- Before last night?
No, I don't--

24:53.564 --> 24:55.298
I don't think so.

24:55.366 --> 24:56.900
I felt the same,

24:56.967 --> 24:58.735
but then I saw this flash
of recognition in your face.

24:58.803 --> 25:00.837
Was I mistaken?

25:00.905 --> 25:02.972
No, it's just, um...

25:03.040 --> 25:04.474
You look like
a friend of mine.

25:04.542 --> 25:06.309
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

25:06.377 --> 25:08.812
Zavier mentioned you just
moved into the neighborhood.

25:08.879 --> 25:10.980
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

25:11.048 --> 25:14.584
I hear it's a pretty
dangerous neighborhood.

25:14.652 --> 25:17.687
[Gus barking]

25:20.491 --> 25:21.891
Sorry about that.

25:21.959 --> 25:24.561
What's going on here?
Who are you?

25:28.799 --> 25:30.800
- Any word on Gorka yet?
- Disappeared again.

25:30.868 --> 25:34.804
I think he may be part vapor.

25:34.872 --> 25:37.273
The pictures you found,
by the way,

25:37.341 --> 25:39.609
piqued everyone's interest.

25:39.677 --> 25:41.611
"Eduardo Riera Campillo."

25:41.679 --> 25:43.880
Vice consul
of the Spanish embassy.

25:43.948 --> 25:46.616
And once upon a time,
he was a Magistrate

25:46.684 --> 25:48.585
with the <i>Audiencia Nacional</i>
in Madrid.

25:48.652 --> 25:51.054
Let me guess.
He ruled against Gorka's appeal.

25:51.121 --> 25:53.323
Even better.
He refused to hear it.

25:53.390 --> 25:54.691
[Chuckles]

25:54.758 --> 25:57.393
C.N.I. is moving him
into a safe house temporarily,

25:57.461 --> 25:59.395
and they've begun to discreetly
evacuate the embassy.

25:59.463 --> 26:00.630
And what about Zavier?

26:00.698 --> 26:02.298
He hasn't left the restaurant

26:02.366 --> 26:04.100
since he got back
from the market.

26:04.168 --> 26:05.435
Does Joan want me
to go back in?

26:05.502 --> 26:07.303
Don't know.
FBI is on point now.

26:11.709 --> 26:13.776
Permission requested
to read in Zavier Etxarte

26:13.844 --> 26:14.878
as a CIA asset.

26:14.945 --> 26:17.247
No.

26:17.314 --> 26:18.681
Why not?

26:18.749 --> 26:20.583
Because there's
a strong possibility

26:20.651 --> 26:22.752
he's still an active member
of a terrorist cell,

26:22.820 --> 26:24.287
and at the very least,
he's been harboring

26:24.355 --> 26:25.855
a potentially dangerous
person of interest.

26:25.923 --> 26:27.857
He let his brother sleep
on his couch.

26:27.925 --> 26:29.993
Zavier's not a terrorist.
He has too much to lose.

26:30.060 --> 26:31.494
And you've known him
for how long--two days?

26:31.562 --> 26:33.463
Assets need to be vetted
much more fully.

26:33.530 --> 26:34.964
We might not have
enough time.

26:35.032 --> 26:36.933
Because this is rapidly
becoming a criminal matter,

26:37.001 --> 26:38.668
I'm gonna let the Bureau
handle it from here.

26:38.736 --> 26:40.303
If you've been disappointed
with my performance lately,

26:40.371 --> 26:41.437
I wish you'd come out
and tell me.

26:41.505 --> 26:42.772
What are you talking about?

26:42.840 --> 26:44.240
You've been dismissive
ever since I came back.

26:44.308 --> 26:45.608
- Annie--
- And you've run roughshod

26:45.676 --> 26:47.810
over every objection
I've had regarding Zavier.

26:47.878 --> 26:49.545
Before you continue,
I'd advise you to consider

26:49.613 --> 26:52.048
where each of us rank in the
hierarchy of this organization.

26:52.116 --> 26:54.450
I'm sorry.

26:54.518 --> 26:57.687
I don't mean to be
disrespectful.

26:59.990 --> 27:02.458
You're feeling down,
and you're beating yourself up.

27:02.526 --> 27:03.760
And that's okay.

27:03.827 --> 27:05.728
I'm confident
you can work through this.

27:05.796 --> 27:07.630
But reading in Zavier
is not gonna make up

27:07.698 --> 27:09.098
for you losing that package

27:09.166 --> 27:10.633
or for how things went
with your sister.

27:10.701 --> 27:12.635
This has nothing to do
with my sister.

27:12.703 --> 27:14.971
Are you sure about that?

27:26.216 --> 27:27.784
- Mr. Wilcox.
- Yes.

27:27.851 --> 27:29.052
Could you come with me,
please?

27:29.119 --> 27:30.787
The D.N.I. would like
to talk with you.

27:30.854 --> 27:32.522
Uh, could we schedule it
for later?

27:32.589 --> 27:33.990
I have a meeting
to get to.

27:34.058 --> 27:35.892
Your deposition on the hill--
we know already.

27:35.960 --> 27:40.163
The D.N.I. would like
a brief word beforehand.

27:51.942 --> 27:53.676
Hello?

27:56.413 --> 27:57.780
Zavier?

27:57.848 --> 28:00.283
Annie!
Hello.

28:02.486 --> 28:04.187
I was just butchering
some meat.

28:04.254 --> 28:06.255
[Chuckles]

28:06.323 --> 28:08.992
- Hey.
- Um...

28:09.059 --> 28:11.627
We are the masters
of bad timing, aren't we?

28:11.695 --> 28:14.630
[Laughs]
Are you closed for lunch?

28:14.698 --> 28:16.833
On Mondays, yes,
I'm closed all day.

28:16.900 --> 28:19.836
But I like to come in by myself
to think about the menu.

28:19.903 --> 28:21.838
You know?

28:21.905 --> 28:24.440
I need to find
your brother.

28:24.508 --> 28:28.077
Do you know
where Gorka is?

28:28.145 --> 28:29.712
I know he's your brother,
Zavier.

28:29.780 --> 28:30.947
I need to find him.

28:31.015 --> 28:33.416
Why do you need to find him?
Who are you?

28:33.484 --> 28:35.518
Are you with the FBI?

28:35.586 --> 28:37.854
I can't give you all
the Details, but trust me.

28:37.921 --> 28:40.490
Cooperating with me will be
better for you in the end

28:40.557 --> 28:41.991
than every other
alternative!

28:42.059 --> 28:43.659
Do you even know
why he's here in D.C.?

28:43.727 --> 28:46.329
You government goons are
really all the same, aren't you?

28:46.397 --> 28:48.164
He served
his sentence already.

28:48.232 --> 28:49.766
Do you understand that?

28:49.833 --> 28:51.334
You have no right
to hunt him down forever!

28:51.402 --> 28:52.602
Zavier--

28:52.669 --> 28:55.738
A couple of laughs
and a little sleepover,

28:55.806 --> 28:58.474
and you now expect me
to betray my brother?

28:58.542 --> 29:00.843
[Pounds wall]
My brother?

29:00.911 --> 29:03.112
I'm asking you
to do the right thing.

29:03.180 --> 29:05.882
Get out of my restaurant...

29:05.949 --> 29:08.451
Now.

29:17.361 --> 29:21.364
[Cell phone ringing]

29:21.432 --> 29:22.465
Yeah.

29:22.533 --> 29:24.167
Annie, where are you
right now?

29:24.234 --> 29:25.701
Etxarte, kind of.
Why?

29:25.769 --> 29:29.338
We got a tip on the safe house
Gorka's guys were holing up in.

29:29.406 --> 29:32.108
Before the FBI could get there,
the place had been vacated.

29:32.176 --> 29:34.510
But they found traces
of ammonium nitrate prills

29:34.578 --> 29:36.079
and acetone peroxide powder.

29:36.146 --> 29:37.180
T.A.T.P.?

29:37.247 --> 29:39.515
They were building
a bomb, Annie.

29:42.086 --> 29:44.620
Did they find any, uh,
champagne bottles?

29:44.688 --> 29:45.721
What?

29:45.789 --> 29:48.391
Cava bottles
o-or labels?

29:48.459 --> 29:50.626
Yes.

29:52.963 --> 29:54.864
The cases of cava
that Gorka brought you--

29:54.932 --> 29:57.567
what did you do with them?
- They're behind the bar.

29:57.634 --> 30:00.136
I thought I told you
to get out.

30:00.204 --> 30:01.237
What do you think
you're doing?

30:01.305 --> 30:02.538
You're going through
my things now?

30:02.606 --> 30:05.341
[Grunts]

30:15.419 --> 30:18.054
This is ridiculous.
I think you're paranoid.

30:18.122 --> 30:20.523
Okay.

30:20.591 --> 30:24.093
[Beeping]

30:26.063 --> 30:29.332
Uh...

30:29.399 --> 30:32.235
Go.

30:41.845 --> 30:44.213
Oh!

30:44.281 --> 30:46.916
[Car alarm blaring]

31:05.382 --> 31:07.149
So what happened?

31:07.217 --> 31:08.751
Did you forget everything
the farm taught you

31:08.819 --> 31:10.052
about defusing a bomb?

31:10.120 --> 31:11.954
I did...

31:12.022 --> 31:15.391
Actually, when I saw that little
red light blinking, and, uh...

31:15.459 --> 31:18.828
There's big gap
between theory and practice.

31:18.896 --> 31:20.897
Well, we got lucky--
no casualties.

31:20.964 --> 31:24.400
We're gonna spin it
as a gas-leak explosion.

31:24.468 --> 31:26.936
Supposedly sounds safer
than a bomb--I don't know.

31:27.004 --> 31:29.238
- Did they find Gorka yet?
- No.

31:29.306 --> 31:32.275
What's gonna happen to Zavier?
We got to find him first.

31:32.342 --> 31:35.244
Pretty sure he's not going
to be a suspect anymore.

31:35.312 --> 31:37.079
This was his whole life.

31:38.749 --> 31:40.349
Well, on the bright side,

31:40.417 --> 31:43.019
at least your sibling's
not trying to blow you up.

31:43.086 --> 31:44.487
No.

31:44.555 --> 31:47.924
She prefers a slower burn.

31:47.991 --> 31:50.593
Well, in case
you can't get home so fast,

31:50.661 --> 31:54.730
here's
a safe-housewarming gift.

31:54.798 --> 31:57.133
You can use it to pop your top
whenever the mood strikes you.

31:57.200 --> 32:00.469
Bottle opener--
cool.

32:00.537 --> 32:02.038
[Chuckles]
If you want to practice,

32:02.105 --> 32:03.739
we can go to Allen's
right now.

32:03.807 --> 32:05.575
Thank you.
But what I want right now

32:05.642 --> 32:08.778
is peace and quiet
and a hot, hot bath.

32:08.845 --> 32:10.413
Besides, my safe house is right
around the corner.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.582
Oh, come on, Annie.
You know the rules.

32:12.649 --> 32:13.916
I know. I'm not supposed
to tell anybody

32:13.984 --> 32:15.785
where my safe house is.
Even you?

32:15.852 --> 32:17.086
That's right--even me.

32:17.154 --> 32:19.021
I'm going there right now,

32:19.089 --> 32:21.023
so, if you don't want to know
where it is,

32:21.091 --> 32:22.625
you better close your eyes.

32:34.304 --> 32:37.974
Hey!
Hey!

32:44.548 --> 32:46.782
Really?

32:50.420 --> 32:52.154
You no-show the deposition?

32:52.222 --> 32:54.423
- I tried to reach you.
- Two hours after the fact.

32:54.491 --> 32:55.791
Do you want to take
a guess

32:55.859 --> 32:57.259
how much of a moron
I looked like today?

32:57.327 --> 32:58.594
You?
What about me?

32:58.662 --> 32:59.895
I'm on my way
out of the building,

32:59.963 --> 33:01.731
and I get yanked
into the D.N.I.'s office.

33:01.798 --> 33:03.466
How the hell did he know
I was coming in?

33:03.533 --> 33:05.668
So what are you saying?
What, that I leaked?

33:05.736 --> 33:08.137
Well, somebody did.

33:08.205 --> 33:10.640
You have no idea how
much pressure they put on you

33:10.707 --> 33:13.109
to keep quiet.

33:13.176 --> 33:16.112
You know I can slap
a subpoena on you right here.

33:16.179 --> 33:17.480
Do it.

33:17.547 --> 33:19.281
I will "I do not recall" you
to death.

33:19.349 --> 33:23.419
I'll deny
I told you anything.

33:23.487 --> 33:25.254
They're gonna have my ass
on this.

33:25.322 --> 33:28.124
I'm gonna make this up
to you, Cam. I promise.

33:28.191 --> 33:29.759
I've played enough poker
with you, Jai,

33:29.826 --> 33:31.827
to know when you're lying.

33:31.895 --> 33:34.964
I just can't figure out why.

33:57.421 --> 34:00.656
[Tires squealing]

34:04.061 --> 34:05.127
[Sighs]

34:05.195 --> 34:07.196
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

34:07.264 --> 34:10.433
[Chuckles] I told you
it was a bad neighborhood.

34:10.500 --> 34:12.534
Come, let's walk.

34:12.601 --> 34:14.870
Don't do anything
stupid now.

34:14.938 --> 34:17.806
[Tires squeal]

34:39.096 --> 34:42.197
What are you doing?
Where are we going?

34:42.264 --> 34:44.734
Well, you are
our insurance policy.

34:44.801 --> 34:47.369
You see, it always helps
to have a hostage...

34:47.437 --> 34:49.105
In case things
don't go as planned.

34:49.172 --> 34:52.041
Now, a female CIA Agent?

34:52.109 --> 34:56.011
That's just, you know,
fantastic.

34:56.079 --> 34:57.580
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:57.647 --> 35:00.116
Are you really going to
try to deny it?

35:00.183 --> 35:02.118
You know what
you look like to me?

35:02.185 --> 35:05.955
You look like a girl that's been
strapped to a car door before.

35:06.022 --> 35:09.058
The thing is,
you're way too cool.

35:09.126 --> 35:11.494
- [Grunts]
- There you go. There you go.

35:11.561 --> 35:12.661
That's the spirit.

35:12.729 --> 35:14.163
Kick the window.
See what happens.

35:14.231 --> 35:16.866
[Breathing heavily] You know,
the restaurant was closed.

35:16.933 --> 35:18.634
Nobody was there
but Zavier.

35:18.702 --> 35:20.202
Zavier was
in the restaurant?

35:20.270 --> 35:21.904
I got him out
before it blew.

35:21.972 --> 35:23.405
I don't know
who your target was,

35:23.473 --> 35:25.608
but no one suffered,
not even a scratch.

35:25.675 --> 35:29.111
How does it feel to fail
so spectacularly?

35:29.179 --> 35:30.746
Who said I failed?

35:30.814 --> 35:32.648
The restaurant was
my only target.

35:32.716 --> 35:34.750
It's a message
to all the <i>quemados.</i>

35:34.818 --> 35:36.118
You jeopardize
our cause,

35:36.186 --> 35:37.820
and you will be held
accountable.

35:37.888 --> 35:39.155
But your brother was--

35:39.222 --> 35:40.556
Zavier stopped being
my brother

35:40.624 --> 35:42.858
the day he gave me up
to save his own neck.

35:42.926 --> 35:44.460
These men right here...
They're my brothers.

35:44.528 --> 35:46.529
It's bad enough he betrays me.

35:46.596 --> 35:48.097
He betrays his family.

35:48.165 --> 35:52.034
But licking the hand
of his Spanish masters?

35:52.102 --> 35:54.737
"Oh, is the soup too hot
for you, Mr. Ambassador?

35:54.805 --> 35:56.672
"Maybe I should, uh,
blow on it

35:56.740 --> 35:58.707
just to get
the perfect temperature."

35:58.775 --> 36:01.343
He's no better than a dog.

36:01.411 --> 36:03.045
And he should know
what it feels like

36:03.113 --> 36:06.415
to lose everything he loves.

36:17.961 --> 36:19.829
[Engine revving]

36:19.896 --> 36:21.363
[Tires squeal]

36:21.431 --> 36:25.034
[Shouting in Basque]

36:26.636 --> 36:29.038
[Tires squealing]

37:04.728 --> 37:05.995
Aah!

37:09.166 --> 37:10.500
Zavier!

37:10.568 --> 37:13.536
I was starting a new life
for the both of us!

37:28.118 --> 37:30.787
Zavier!

37:30.937 --> 37:32.337
Stop!

37:32.359 --> 37:35.695
Stop, Zavier!
Stop!

37:57.549 --> 38:00.317
Are you ready to go,
Mr. Wilcox?

38:02.887 --> 38:04.655
Yeah, I'm ready.

38:28.613 --> 38:32.850
Can I get you
a cup of coffee, sir?

38:32.917 --> 38:34.751
Yeah.
Why not?

38:34.819 --> 38:37.321
Black, two sugars.

38:37.388 --> 38:39.223
Very good, sir.

38:45.964 --> 38:48.265
They say the office
makes the man.

38:48.333 --> 38:50.367
I truly hope
that is the case.

38:50.435 --> 38:51.768
Hey, Dad.

38:51.836 --> 38:54.071
A simple "congratulations"
would suffice.

38:54.139 --> 38:56.874
Three days ago,
you had one foot out the door,

38:56.941 --> 38:59.610
now you're majordomo
of a brand-new initiative,

38:59.677 --> 39:03.313
reporting directly
to the D.N.I.

39:03.381 --> 39:05.349
Bureaucracy has never worked
that fast before.

39:05.416 --> 39:07.885
It was a surprise to me
as well.

39:07.952 --> 39:09.920
You know how many strings
I had to pull

39:09.988 --> 39:11.221
to get you this promotion?

39:11.289 --> 39:12.289
I can't imagine.

39:12.357 --> 39:14.691
All of them.

39:14.759 --> 39:17.394
That's how many.

39:17.462 --> 39:19.630
I hadn't realized
just how low

39:19.697 --> 39:21.732
your star had fallen
around here.

39:21.799 --> 39:24.601
I'm a Wilcox,
for better or worse.

39:24.669 --> 39:26.603
The hell you are.

39:26.671 --> 39:30.307
You say you have a code,
a conscience?

39:30.375 --> 39:32.109
Yet all it takes is
a room with a view

39:32.177 --> 39:34.778
for you to chuck it away.

39:34.846 --> 39:36.313
I'd rather you stand
on principle

39:36.381 --> 39:39.483
and feed me to the wolves
than waver so easily.

39:39.551 --> 39:41.518
At least I'd know
the measure of you.

39:41.586 --> 39:44.454
You are the most
selfish bastard I know.

39:44.522 --> 39:45.889
All my life,

39:45.957 --> 39:47.891
the only time you've ever
done anything for anyone

39:47.959 --> 39:50.961
is if it was
in your own self-interest.

39:51.029 --> 39:53.497
I needed to get out
from under Arthur's thumb.

39:53.565 --> 39:57.234
I had to make sure that
you were properly motivated

39:57.302 --> 39:59.670
to pull your strings.

39:59.737 --> 40:01.872
How did you know I'd get word
about your deposition?

40:01.940 --> 40:04.474
I learned from the best.

40:04.542 --> 40:08.245
You're playing
a dangerous game here, son.

40:11.416 --> 40:14.151
Keep it up.

40:14.219 --> 40:16.053
I like it.

40:19.190 --> 40:21.391
Oh!

40:25.597 --> 40:27.497
- Oh, sorry.
- I thought I heard you up here.

40:27.565 --> 40:30.767
Um, I'm just
clearing out my stuff.

40:30.835 --> 40:32.402
I got your message
the other night--don't worry.

40:32.470 --> 40:33.837
It's just gonna take me
a few trips.

40:33.905 --> 40:36.006
Okay, I'll leave you
to it, then.

40:36.074 --> 40:38.275
Um, I--

40:38.343 --> 40:40.310
I spent so much time and energy

40:40.378 --> 40:42.312
trying to tell you
why I did what I did

40:42.380 --> 40:45.482
that I never said
I'm sorry.

40:45.550 --> 40:48.118
And I'm sorry.

40:48.186 --> 40:49.920
You're my sister
and my best friend,

40:49.988 --> 40:52.889
and you don't deserve to be
treated like that.

40:56.794 --> 40:58.362
If you can only carry
one box...

41:01.699 --> 41:03.033
Take this one.

41:03.101 --> 41:06.103
That's the stuff
you're really gonna need.

41:10.341 --> 41:12.776
Thank you.

41:12.844 --> 41:15.712
Mm-hmm. Yeah, and, uh,
you know about the...

41:15.780 --> 41:17.080
Other ones,
there's no rush.

41:17.148 --> 41:19.016
I thought you were trying
to rent it out.

41:19.083 --> 41:21.018
Yeah. No, I am.
Um, but...

41:21.085 --> 41:23.954
I'm--I'm not in a hurry.

41:24.022 --> 41:26.390
It's hard to find
the right person.

41:26.457 --> 41:29.293
