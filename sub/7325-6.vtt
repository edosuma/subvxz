WEBVTT

00:02.733 --> 00:04.105
(Meredith) DOCTORS HAVE NEVER
HAD ALL THE ANSWERS.

00:04.105 --> 00:05.776
DEREK, I DON'T KNOW.

00:05.776 --> 00:08.779
IT ISN'T JUST A VISIT.
SHE'S "BACK" BACK.

00:08.779 --> 00:10.281
♪♪♪

00:10.281 --> 00:13.044
IT'S ONLY BEEN TWO NIGHTS.

00:13.044 --> 00:14.415
♪♪♪

00:14.415 --> 00:16.547
AS LONG AS SHE NEEDS.

00:16.547 --> 00:19.520
I MEAN, SHE LOST SOMEONE.
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH SOME STUFF.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.052
I THINK SHE JUST NEEDS
HER FRIENDS.

00:21.052 --> 00:22.193
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE ALONE.

00:22.193 --> 00:24.195
THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN YOU WERE SICK,

00:24.195 --> 00:27.558
WE'D JUST DRAIN YOUR BLOOD LIKE
YOU WERE GETTING AN OIL CHANGE.

00:27.558 --> 00:30.231
TODAY IS, UH,
KNEE REPLACEMENT DAY, RIGHT?

00:30.231 --> 00:31.562
HAD TO CANCEL THEM.

00:31.562 --> 00:33.564
WE'RE MEETING WITH OUR LAWYERS
TODAY ABOUT THE CRASH.

00:33.564 --> 00:35.106
OH. HOW'S THAT GOING?

00:35.106 --> 00:37.568
UH, I'M... (sighs)
NOT ALLOWED TO SAY.

00:37.568 --> 00:39.070
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S FINE.

00:39.070 --> 00:40.611
HOW'S ARIZONA?

00:40.611 --> 00:42.573
NOT ALLOWED TO SAY.
(chuckles)

00:42.573 --> 00:45.176
(sighs) YOU.

00:45.176 --> 00:46.477
DR. BAILEY. HERE YOU GO.
(sighs) SHE WON'T...

00:46.477 --> 00:48.219
OH, THANK YOU.
SEE ANYONE.

00:48.219 --> 00:49.350
SHE WON'T EVEN
LEAVE THE HOUSE.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.352
YEAH, AND... SHE'S WALKING.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.053
SHE'S EVEN WORKING
WITH HER PROSTHESIS,

00:53.053 --> 00:54.225
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT HAS TO BE PERFECT.

00:54.225 --> 00:55.426
AND I TRY TO BE ENCOURAGING,

00:55.426 --> 00:56.587
BUT THEN SHE TELLS ME
I'M PUSHING HER.

00:56.587 --> 00:57.758
TELL HER I SAY
GET HER ASS IN HERE.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.059
OH... (laughs) SWEET.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.791
THEN SHE CAN BE CRANKY
AND RESENTFUL TO YOU.

01:00.791 --> 01:02.393
WE'RE CONSTANTLY
HAVING TO RETHINK

01:02.393 --> 01:04.335
WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS TRUE...

01:04.335 --> 01:05.496
OH.

01:05.496 --> 01:06.667
AND REDEFINE IT.

01:06.667 --> 01:07.838
WILSON, YOU STINK.

01:07.838 --> 01:09.240
VOMIT. IT'S VOMIT.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.671
I'M COVERING THE PIT,
AND SANTA CLAUS CAME TO TOWN.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.403
I DON'T NEED A PLAY-BY-PLAY.
GO CLEAN YOURSELF UP.

01:12.403 --> 01:13.574
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.745
GO. YOU'RE DISGUSTING.

01:14.745 --> 01:16.607
(smartphone chimes)

01:16.607 --> 01:18.449
WHAT IS THIS?

01:18.449 --> 01:19.710
WHAT?

01:19.710 --> 01:21.252
THIS LIST YOUR
REAL ESTATE AGENT SENT TO MINE.

01:21.252 --> 01:23.154
"REPAIR DISCOLORED/BURNED
PORTION, HARDWOOD FLOORS"?

01:23.154 --> 01:24.815
OH, THAT'S JUST SOME STUFF
YOU GOTTA TAKE CARE OF.

01:24.815 --> 01:27.087
"REPAIR/REFINISH WOOD MOLDING
IN DOORJAMBS"?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.419
YEAH,
THEY'RE ALL SCRATCHED UP.

01:28.419 --> 01:30.121
THERE'S LIKE FIVE THINGS
YOU GOTTA FIX.

01:30.121 --> 01:31.622
AND WHAT IF I DON'T?
THEN I'M NOT BUYING
YOUR HOUSE.

01:31.622 --> 01:33.164
WELL, THAT'S CRAZY,

01:33.164 --> 01:34.695
BECAUSE YOU BEGGED ME
TO SELL YOU THAT HOUSE.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.427
WE MADE A DEAL.
WE SHOOK ON IT.

01:36.427 --> 01:37.598
WE DRANK ON IT.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.130
THESE ARE REASONABLE REQUESTS.
COME ON, MER.

01:39.130 --> 01:41.232
I MEAN, WE'RE FRIENDS,
BUT THIS IS BUSINESS.

01:41.232 --> 01:42.573
WE GOTTA BE
LIKE GROWN-UPS HERE.

01:42.573 --> 01:43.874
DID YOU JUST TELL ME
TO GROW UP?

01:43.874 --> 01:45.376
I HATE KAREV.

01:45.376 --> 01:46.607
SECONDED.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.778
OH, MOTION CARRIED.

01:47.778 --> 01:50.110
WE HATE KAREV.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

01:50.110 --> 01:52.213
I'M COVERING THE PIT,
AND SANTA CLAUS CAME TO TOWN.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.215
YOU KNOW, I WAS STARTING TO
THINK THAT HE WAS AN OKAY GUY,

01:54.215 --> 01:56.187
BUT HE'S JUST MEAN.
SANTA?

01:56.187 --> 01:57.148
KAREV.

01:57.148 --> 01:58.449
SANTA CAME IN
TWO WEEKS AGO,

01:58.449 --> 01:59.820
AND HE BARFED
ALL OVER ME, TOO.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.152
HE BARFED ALL DAY.

02:01.152 --> 02:02.523
DID HE SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT ME?

02:02.523 --> 02:04.124
SANTA?
KAREV.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.696
DON'T DO THAT. DON'T BE
THE SAD GIRL WITH THE HANG-UP.

02:05.696 --> 02:07.228
IT'S PATHETIC.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.199
HE SLEPT WITH HEATHER.
SHE'S NOT HUNG UP.

02:08.199 --> 02:09.360
WHY DID YOU START YOUR YEAR

02:09.360 --> 02:10.531
BY HAVING SEX
WITH YOUR BOSS ANYWAY?

02:10.531 --> 02:12.132
'CAUSE HE'S STUPID HOT.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.165
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

02:14.165 --> 02:16.237
I HAVE SOCIAL ANXIETY,

02:16.237 --> 02:18.309
SO SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER
THAN TALKING.

02:18.309 --> 02:20.271
OH.
I'M A REALLY GOOD LISTENER.

02:20.271 --> 02:21.772
I'M JUST SAYIN'.

02:21.772 --> 02:24.275
JACKASSES, ALL OF YOU.

02:24.275 --> 02:26.177
MM.

02:26.177 --> 02:27.348
(exhales)

02:27.348 --> 02:28.749
(exhales)

02:28.749 --> 02:30.221
WOW.

02:30.221 --> 02:31.282
THAT WAS...

02:31.282 --> 02:33.224
SO...

02:33.224 --> 02:35.626
SO STUPID.

02:35.626 --> 02:37.328
NOT WHERE I WAS GOING
WITH THAT.

02:37.328 --> 02:39.330
OH, WH-- (laughs)

02:39.330 --> 02:41.232
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

02:41.232 --> 02:43.794
HOW MANY TIMES CAN I SAY
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING

02:43.794 --> 02:46.637
AND THEN THE NEXT THING
I KNOW, IT'S HAPPENED?

02:46.637 --> 02:49.300
I AM... I'M SO WEAK.

02:49.300 --> 02:51.302
YOU'RE NOT WEAK.
YOU'RE JUST--

02:51.302 --> 02:52.643
DISGUSTING.
(sighs)

02:52.643 --> 02:54.605
I WAS A GOOD PERSON ONCE.

02:54.605 --> 02:56.207
A PERSON WITH WILLPOWER.

02:56.207 --> 02:57.778
I HAVE FASTED BEFORE.

02:57.778 --> 02:58.949
THIS IS WORSE.

02:58.949 --> 03:02.213
THIS JUST FEELS HELPLESS
AND INEVITABLE.

03:02.213 --> 03:05.616
LIKE... LIKE WATCHING TWO CARS
HEAD TOWARD ONE ANOTHER

03:05.616 --> 03:08.919
AND... THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO.

03:08.919 --> 03:11.262
THERE'S GONNA BE A CRASH.

03:11.262 --> 03:13.294
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.466
AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE
LEFT THERE--
(door opens and closes)

03:16.897 --> 03:18.399
WH--

03:18.399 --> 03:20.271
YOU ARE LUCKY I'M EVEN
SELLING YOU THIS HOUSE.

03:20.271 --> 03:21.772
YOU'RE LUCKY I'M BUYING IT.

03:21.772 --> 03:23.334
THAT LIST IS
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

03:23.334 --> 03:24.875
I MEAN, THERE'S DRY ROT--

03:24.875 --> 03:26.537
THERE IS NO DRY ROT.

03:26.537 --> 03:27.708
AAH! AH!

03:27.708 --> 03:29.240
BRIAN DANZIGER, 17,

03:29.240 --> 03:30.541
HE PASSED OUT
IN FIRST PERIOD ENGLISH.

03:30.541 --> 03:32.543
UH, SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAIN,
TREMORS, AND HE'S HYPERTENSIVE.

03:32.543 --> 03:34.245
HIS PARENTS ARE ON THE WAY.

03:34.245 --> 03:35.786
BRIAN, WERE YOU DRINKING
THIS MORNING?

03:35.786 --> 03:36.917
(Alex)
DID YOU TAKE ANYTHING?

03:36.917 --> 03:38.349
NO, I DON'T TAKE DRUGS.

03:38.349 --> 03:40.421
OH, GOD! WHAT HAPPENED?
HE'S DISTENDED,

03:40.421 --> 03:42.253
AND HE'S GOT TENDERNESS
IN THE RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT.

03:42.253 --> 03:43.954
DOES HE LOOK JAUNDICED
TO YOU?
A LITTLE.

03:43.954 --> 03:45.456
BRIAN, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO LIE BACK DOWN, PLEASE.

03:45.456 --> 03:46.627
(grunts)

03:46.627 --> 03:47.998
I--

03:47.998 --> 03:50.731
OH. ALEX.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.403
(grunts)

03:52.403 --> 03:53.564
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

03:53.564 --> 03:55.306
UH, ALL RIGHT.

03:55.306 --> 03:56.807
MAKE SURE YOU GET L.F.T.s,
COAGS, A TOX SCREEN,

03:56.807 --> 03:58.269
AND AN ABDOMINAL C.T.

03:58.269 --> 03:59.610
EDWARDS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS?

03:59.610 --> 04:01.612
I THINK...

04:01.612 --> 04:03.474
(groans)
I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW.

04:03.474 --> 04:04.875
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE DON'T EITHER.

04:04.875 --> 04:06.847
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
THIS KID COULD HAVE DRY ROT.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.850
(indistinct conversations)

04:11.251 --> 04:13.654
I'M SORRY I MESSED YOU UP
LIKE THAT, HON.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.887
I START PUKING LIKE THIS,
IT DOESN'T STOP FOR DAYS.

04:16.887 --> 04:18.389
WELL, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
SOME FLUIDS

04:18.389 --> 04:20.991
TO COUNTERACT THE ALCOHOL
IN YOUR SYSTEM.

04:20.991 --> 04:22.393
I DON'T HAVE ANY ALCOHOL
IN MY SYSTEM.

04:22.393 --> 04:24.435
MM-HMM. LAST TIME
YOU THREW UP ALL OVER US,

04:24.435 --> 04:27.338
YOUR ALCOHOL LEVEL WAS .21,

04:27.338 --> 04:29.840
AND THE TIME BEFORE THAT,
IT WAS EVEN HIGHER.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.272
IT DOES TAKE THE--THE PAIN
DOWN A NOTCH.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.445
BUT I-I SWEAR TO YOU, HON,
I AIN'T BEEN DRINKING NOTHING.

04:34.445 --> 04:36.907
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

04:36.907 --> 04:38.979
MY STOMACH HURTS SO BAD,

04:38.979 --> 04:41.312
AND I JUST GET SO NAUSEOUS,
I JUST WISH I WOULD DIE.

04:41.312 --> 04:43.414
PLEASE.
YOU--YOU GOT TO HELP ME.

04:43.414 --> 04:45.316
WELL,
LET'S FIGURE IT OUT THEN.

04:45.316 --> 04:46.487
MM. (vomits)

04:46.487 --> 04:47.658
(elevator bell dings)

04:47.658 --> 04:48.889
OKAY.
(groans)

04:48.889 --> 04:50.361
(clatters)

04:50.361 --> 04:51.992
(sighs)

04:53.424 --> 04:54.925
I TOLD YOU
TO CHANGE YOUR SHIRT.

04:54.925 --> 04:56.296
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

04:58.399 --> 05:00.531
THIS IS
WHAT I CAN OFFER YOU...

05:00.531 --> 05:02.833
SALARY-WISE.

05:04.034 --> 05:05.776
THAT'S FINE.
THANK YOU.

05:05.776 --> 05:07.007
YOU DON'T NEED TO THANK ME.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.479
THANK JEFF RUSSELL.

05:08.479 --> 05:10.981
HE REALLY PUSHED
TO GET YOU HERE.

05:10.981 --> 05:12.343
WHO'S JEFF RUSSELL?

05:12.343 --> 05:13.514
HE'S THE NEW CARDIO CHIEF.
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.845
YOU'LL LIKE HIM.
OR YOU WON'T.

05:14.845 --> 05:17.317
OH, THERE'S A MEETING TODAY
ABOUT THE PLANE CRASH

05:17.317 --> 05:18.589
WITH THE LAWYERS.

05:18.589 --> 05:19.850
WILL YOU BE THERE?

05:19.850 --> 05:21.021
I WILL.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.393
SO DO I HAVE TO COME?

05:22.393 --> 05:24.825
NO, I WILL BE THERE
TO SUPPORT MY STAFF,

05:24.825 --> 05:26.597
NOT AS YOUR PROXY.

05:27.858 --> 05:30.461
I'M NOT YOUR PROXY ANYMORE.

05:30.461 --> 05:32.703
ALL RIGHT.

05:32.703 --> 05:34.635
SO...

05:34.635 --> 05:37.638
NOW HERE'S
YOUR ORIENTATION PACKET.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.440
WELCOME.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.971
AND I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

05:40.971 --> 05:43.374
(door opens)

05:43.374 --> 05:53.654
(siren wailing)

05:53.654 --> 05:55.656
(wailing continues)

05:59.890 --> 06:00.861
JAMIE'S APPY WENT PERFECTLY.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.362
HER INCISION LOOKS GREAT,

06:02.362 --> 06:03.864
BUT HER THROAT IS STILL
GIVING ME CAUSE FOR CONCERN.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.035
IT'S JUST A SORE THROAT,
RIGHT?

06:05.035 --> 06:06.937
PROBABLY JUST AN INFECTION,

06:06.937 --> 06:08.699
BUT THE SWELLING IS ABNORMAL.

06:08.699 --> 06:10.671
SO I WANT TO KEEP HER HERE
ANOTHER DAY

06:10.671 --> 06:12.573
AND RUN SOME TESTS
JUST TO BE SURE.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.144
OF COURSE. LET'S BE SURE.
THANK YOU.

06:14.144 --> 06:15.576
YEAH.

06:15.576 --> 06:19.049
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

06:19.049 --> 06:20.611
(elevator bell dings)

06:22.413 --> 06:23.884
(woman on TV) AND OF COURSE
THE KIDS GOT TO IT

06:23.884 --> 06:26.517
BEFORE MY HUSBAND
COULD EVEN TRY IT.

06:26.517 --> 06:27.688
(laughter)

06:27.688 --> 06:28.889
(cell phone ringing)

06:28.889 --> 06:30.591
(man) ALL RIGHT, AND THE JUDGE
IS TASTING IT NOW,

06:30.591 --> 06:32.963
AND WE ARE GONNA SEE
WHAT YOU GET, SUSAN.

06:32.963 --> 06:34.695
THAT IS THREE AND A HALF
OUT OF FOUR APPLES!

06:34.695 --> 06:35.826
(sighs)

06:35.826 --> 06:37.898
(rings and beeps)
HELLO.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.531
HEY, ARIZONA. IT'S, UH,
MIRANDA BAILEY. HOW ARE YOU?

06:40.531 --> 06:41.732
Uh... (chuckles)

06:41.732 --> 06:42.903
WELL, I'M, YOU KNOW, I'M--

06:42.903 --> 06:44.735
I-I wish I had time to talk,

06:44.735 --> 06:46.036
BUT I'M CALLING FOR A FAVOR.

06:46.036 --> 06:49.580
I HAVE A 13-YEAR-OLD FEMALE

06:49.580 --> 06:50.911
three days post-appendectomy

06:50.911 --> 06:54.545
with a persistent sore throat
and as of this morning,

06:54.545 --> 06:56.447
severe swelling
on the left side of her neck.

06:56.447 --> 06:58.519
I-I'M KIND OF AT A LOSS HERE.
Well...

06:58.519 --> 07:00.420
GET A C.T.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.752
I-I AM. I AM.

07:01.752 --> 07:03.694
I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT KNOW
OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD.

07:03.694 --> 07:06.096
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

07:06.096 --> 07:08.859
MAYBE. I-I MEAN, I'D HAVE TO
TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHART.

07:08.859 --> 07:11.762
YOU KNOW, BAILEY, I'M--I'M NOT
REALLY BACK TO WORK YET,

07:11.762 --> 07:13.103
AND--AND I'M...
(turns off TV)

07:13.103 --> 07:15.506
BUSY.
I know, I know. I just...

07:15.506 --> 07:17.838
WH-WHAT IF I HAVE, UM, AN INTERN

07:17.838 --> 07:19.009
bring you a copy
of the chart?

07:19.009 --> 07:20.941
You take a look.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.444
IF IT SPARKS ANYTHING,
YOU CAN CALL ME BACK.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.616
WELL, CAN'T YOU JUST
E-MAIL IT?

07:25.616 --> 07:26.947
UM, NOT SCANNED YET.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.922
FINE. FINE.
JUST SEND THE CHART OVER.

07:31.922 --> 07:33.123
OH, THANKS SO MUCH.

07:33.123 --> 07:35.756
SIR, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.127
(elevator bell dings)

07:37.127 --> 07:38.829
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL ME SIR.

07:38.829 --> 07:40.130
I DO. IT HELPS ME.

07:40.130 --> 07:41.962
SIR...

07:41.962 --> 07:43.994
YOU NEED TO GET
YOUR AVERYS STRAIGHT.

07:43.994 --> 07:44.965
OH?

07:44.965 --> 07:46.136
IN YOUR ADDRESS BOOK.

07:46.136 --> 07:47.838
LAST NIGHT...
(clears throat)

07:47.838 --> 07:50.470
YOU SENT AN E-MAIL, WHICH I
BELIEVE WAS FOR MY MOTHER.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.972
OH.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.675
IT BEGAN, "I CAN'T SLEEP.
THINKING ABOUT YOU TONIGHT"--

07:54.675 --> 07:56.046
UH, TH-THAT'S ENOUGH.

07:56.046 --> 07:57.908
WELL, IT WOULD'VE BEEN
FOR ME, TOO.

07:57.908 --> 07:59.550
BUT IT REALLY GOES ON.

07:59.550 --> 08:02.553
SIR, I DO NOT LIKE THINKING
ABOUT YOU IN THAT WAY,

08:02.553 --> 08:03.884
OR MY MOTHER IN THAT WAY,

08:03.884 --> 08:05.716
OR YOU AND MY MOTHER
IN THAT WAY.

08:05.716 --> 08:07.918
MESSAGE RECEIVED, SON.
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

08:07.918 --> 08:09.920
MNH-MNH. MNH-MNH. DON'T--
DON'T CALL ME "SON."

08:09.920 --> 08:12.623
I-I MEANT IT COLLOQUIALLY.

08:12.623 --> 08:14.665
THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN
EITHER.

08:14.665 --> 08:15.966
WELL, I TOOK THE LIBERTY

08:15.966 --> 08:18.799
OF FORWARDING YOUR E-MAIL
ON TO MY MOTHER.

08:18.799 --> 08:19.970
UH, THANK YOU FOR THAT.

08:19.970 --> 08:20.931
ALL RIGHT. (clears throat)
SIR.

08:20.931 --> 08:22.102
YEAH.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.034
(elevator bell dings)

08:24.034 --> 08:26.036
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TELL ME

08:26.036 --> 08:27.778
WHEN BRIAN DANZIGER'S LABS
CAME BACK.

08:27.778 --> 08:28.909
OH, I THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED
TO TELL DR. KAREV.

08:28.909 --> 08:29.910

08:29.910 --> 08:31.081
(elevator bell dings)

08:31.081 --> 08:32.242
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU, TOO.

08:32.242 --> 08:34.084
UH, BRIAN DANZIGER'S LABS
ARE BACK--

08:34.084 --> 08:35.245
GET AWAY FROM ME.

OH, NOT FAIR.
YOU ARE THE SCARIEST ONE.

08:36.947 --> 08:38.118
THAT WAS ALWAYS
SUPPOSED TO BE ME.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.690
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT.

08:39.690 --> 08:41.592
I'LL ESTABLISH DOMINANCE.

08:41.592 --> 08:43.023
MAYBE I'LL USE
ONE OF THE CLASSICS.

08:43.023 --> 08:43.994
HOW WAS OWEN?

08:43.994 --> 08:45.696
YOU MEAN CHIEF HUNT?

08:45.696 --> 08:48.799
THE HUSBAND FORMERLY KNOWN
AS OWEN IS NOW JUST MY EMPLOYER.

HEY, KAREV,
WHEN YOU BUY MER'S HOUSE,

09:15.255 --> 09:17.928

NOPE. NO ROOMMATES.

YOU'RE SELLING HIM YOUR HOUSE?

09:21.031 --> 09:22.693
I MIGHT NOT. HE WANTS ME
TO RIP OUT THE FLOORS.

I'LL TAKE THE FLOORS
AS IS.

09:52.022 --> 09:53.894

BECAUSE THINGS WERE REALLY
HEATING UP, AND THEN SUDDENLY,

HE STOPS RETURNING MY TEXTS.

09:57.127 --> 09:59.670

A SIZEABLE AWARD.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.268
YEAH.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.140
FAR MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAN
THE SETTLEMENT THEY OFFERED YOU.

12:50.140 --> 12:51.271
WHERE'S ALL THE MONEY
COME FROM?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.103
WELL, WE'RE LOOKING
AT THE POSSIBILITIES NOW.

12:53.103 --> 12:56.106
UH, THE CHARTER COMPANY,
UH, AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURER,

12:56.106 --> 12:59.950
PARTS MANUFACTURERS,
THE PILOT, OF COURSE.

12:59.950 --> 13:01.351
THE GROUND CREW

13:01.351 --> 13:02.512
JERRY?
DID YOU SAY JERRY?

13:02.512 --> 13:04.354
WHO'S JERRY?
(Derek) THE PILOT.

13:04.354 --> 13:05.315
HE WAS UP THERE WITH US.

13:05.315 --> 13:06.957
HE BROKE HIS BACK.
HE'S PARALYZED NOW.

13:06.957 --> 13:08.258
(Meredith) YOU'RE GONNA
GO AFTER HIM?

13:08.258 --> 13:09.990
WELL, IF WE FIND HE WAS
NEGLIGENT, SHOULDN'T WE?

13:09.990 --> 13:11.361
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T HELP.

13:11.361 --> 13:13.263
UM, I'VE GOT
NO RESIDUAL INJURIES,

13:13.263 --> 13:15.325
AND I'VE GOTTA GO RUN

13:15.325 --> 13:17.367
SO, YOU KNOW, GOOD LUCK.

13:17.367 --> 13:18.929

YOU HAVE A SPECIAL BOND.

13:24.374 --> 13:26.977
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
SOMETHING HORRIBLE

13:26.977 --> 13:28.438
AND SURVIVED IT TOGETHER.

13:28.438 --> 13:30.810
(sighs)
BUT AS FAR AS THE PILOT
IS CONCERNED,

13:30.810 --> 13:33.213
YOU NEED TO STOP THINKING
OF HIM AS ONE OF YOU

13:33.213 --> 13:36.216
AND START THINKING OF HIM
AS ONE OF THEM.

13:45.595 --> 13:47.227
I AM DR. YANG, DR. RUSSELL'S
CARDIOTHORACIC FELLOW.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.528

WASH OUT OR BE FIRED,

13:59.409 --> 14:01.471

YOUR NAMES FOR AT LEAST A YEAR.

14:01.471 --> 14:03.173
I WILL CALL YOU
BY YOUR DWARF NAMES.

14:03.173 --> 14:05.215
YOU, HAPPY.

14:05.215 --> 14:06.846
YOU...

14:06.846 --> 14:08.979
MOUSEY.

14:08.979 --> 14:10.580
THERE WASN'T A DWARF
NAMED MOUSEY.

14:10.580 --> 14:12.282
THEY SAVED HER FOR YOU.

14:12.282 --> 14:14.854
NOW GET ME UP TO SPEED--
EVERY PATIENT, EVERY CHART.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.156
I WANT TO KNOW THIS FLOOR
BETTER THAN YOU DO.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.327
RIGHT.

14:17.327 --> 14:18.588
WRONG.
YOU'RE SURGICAL INTERNS.

14:18.588 --> 14:20.530
NO ONE SHOULD KNOW THIS FLOOR
BETTER THAN YOU.

14:20.530 --> 14:22.132
YOU'RE DOPEY NOW.

14:22.132 --> 14:23.263
SHE'S WORSE THAN MEDUSA.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.594
I HATE HER.

14:24.594 --> 14:26.596
I HEARD THAT.

14:26.596 --> 14:28.298
(Meredith) SO WE'RE NOT SURE
IF IT'S CANCEROUS,

14:28.298 --> 14:30.600
BUT THERE IS A MASS ON HIS
LIVER, AND IT IS HEMORRHAGING.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.303
SO WE'D LIKE TO DO A BIOPSY
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

14:33.303 --> 14:35.045
ALL RIGHT. OF COURSE.

14:35.045 --> 14:36.546

THE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE--

14:39.449 --> 14:41.651
COUPLED WITH A HEPATIC LESION,
IT'S ALL CONSISTENT

14:41.651 --> 14:44.214
WITH, UH, THE USE
OF ANABOLIC STEROIDS.

14:44.214 --> 14:46.086
(man) WHAT?
WHAT THE HELL?

14:46.086 --> 14:47.587
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:47.587 --> 14:49.319
BRIAN...

14:49.319 --> 14:51.521
ARE YOU TAKING STEROIDS?
NO.

14:51.521 --> 14:53.063
(Meredith) HAVE YOU NOTICED
CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR,

14:53.063 --> 14:54.995
UH, MOODINESS, DEPRESSION...

14:54.995 --> 14:57.367
SHUT UP! JUST SHUT UP!
I SAID I DON'T TAKE THEM.

14:57.367 --> 14:58.468
BRIAN.

14:58.468 --> 14:59.569
UNPROVOKED AGGRESSION?

14:59.569 --> 15:00.971
DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

15:00.971 --> 15:02.202
HE'S NOT EVEN AN ATHLETE.

15:02.202 --> 15:05.235
HE'S IN THE MODEL U.N.

15:05.235 --> 15:07.277
BRIAN, BABY...

15:07.277 --> 15:09.309
JUST TELL ME.

15:09.309 --> 15:12.012
IF YOU DID IT, HONEY...

15:12.012 --> 15:14.344
JUST TELL ME.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.190
I WANTED...

15:23.253 --> 15:26.156
GIRLS ONLY LIKE THE GUYS

15:26.156 --> 15:28.228
WITH THESE CRAZY BODIES NOW.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.331
(sighs)

15:31.331 --> 15:36.036
I WANTED A SHOT
AT SOMEONE LIKING... ME.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.408
BRIAN, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN TAKING THEM?

15:38.408 --> 15:41.041
I SWEAR,
I'VE BARELY TAKEN ANY.

15:42.612 --> 15:45.345
(voice breaking) FOR TWO YEARS.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.077
SINCE SOPHOMORE YEAR.

15:48.518 --> 15:51.151
THAT'S WHEN YOU STOPPED
BEING MY BOY.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.384
(crying) I'M SORRY.

15:54.384 --> 15:56.526
I'M SO SORRY.

15:56.526 --> 15:58.958
I DIDN'T KNOW.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.992
I DIDN'T KNOW.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.367
WILSON, WHAT'S THE STATUS
ON OUR FREQUENT FLYER?

16:07.367 --> 16:08.498
SANTA?
MM-HMM.

16:08.498 --> 16:10.700
I DON'T KNOW.
HE WASN'T LYING.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.343
HIS LABS CAME BACK NEGATIVE
FOR DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.

16:13.343 --> 16:15.605
HE'S DEHYDRATED,
BUT OTHERWISE,

16:15.605 --> 16:18.278
HIS CHEM PANEL'S GOOD, HIS BLOOD
SUGAR'S SURPRISINGLY GOOD.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.709
TREAT HIM AND STREET HIM.

16:19.709 --> 16:21.081
I'M SORRY?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.412
SANTA CLAUS HAS BEEN
COMING HERE FOR YEARS.

16:22.412 --> 16:24.284
SAME SYMPTOMS--ALWAYS DRUNK,
ALWAYS NAUSEOUS.

16:24.284 --> 16:27.217
WE ALWAYS RUN MULTIPLE TESTS,
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS NEGATIVE.

16:27.217 --> 16:29.189
HE'S LOOKING FOR DRUGS.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.191
GIVE HIM SOME ANTIEMETICS,
GIVE HIM SOME FOOD,

16:31.191 --> 16:32.692
AND SEND HIM ON HIS WAY.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.994
I JUST FEEL LIKE
THERE'S MORE TO THIS--

16:34.994 --> 16:37.097
WILSON, I KNOW
YOU WANT TO HELP.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.428
BUT YOU'RE A SURGICAL INTERN,

16:38.428 --> 16:39.729
AND YOUR SKILLS
ARE NEEDED ELSEWHERE,

16:39.729 --> 16:43.433
AND... WE NEED THAT BED.

16:43.433 --> 16:45.405
(indistinct conversation)

16:45.405 --> 16:47.437
DISCHARGE HIM, PLEASE.

16:47.437 --> 16:51.441
(indistinct conversations
continue)

16:55.445 --> 16:57.417
(sighs)

16:58.718 --> 17:00.290
HEY.

17:00.290 --> 17:03.153
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU.

17:03.153 --> 17:05.625
YOU GUYS ALWAYS SAY THAT.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.727
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
WE CAN DO.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.399
SO I GOTTA GET.

17:09.399 --> 17:10.360
YEAH.

17:10.360 --> 17:11.701
YOU GOT A BLANKET
I CAN TAKE WITH ME?

17:11.701 --> 17:14.264
I--I'M FREEZING
TO DEATH.

17:24.214 --> 17:25.375
HEY.

17:25.375 --> 17:26.516
(Jackson clears throat,
elevator bell dings)

17:26.516 --> 17:28.047
STOP.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.781
(people speaking indistinctly)

17:33.583 --> 17:35.455
YOU DON'T GET TO
HAVE SEX WITH ME

17:35.455 --> 17:36.586
AND THEN JUST WALK OUT

17:36.586 --> 17:39.058
WITHOUT EVEN SO MUCH
AS A "HAVE A NICE DAY," OKAY?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.490
I DESERVE MORE RESPECT
THAN THAT.

17:40.490 --> 17:42.692
WHAT ABOUT ME?
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

17:42.692 --> 17:44.394
I HAVE TO STICK AROUND
AND LISTEN TO YOU

17:44.394 --> 17:46.196
COMPARE SEX WITH ME
TO A FATAL CAR CRASH?

17:46.196 --> 17:48.198
HEAR HOW REPELLANT,
HOW DISGUSTING...

17:48.198 --> 17:49.799
NO. NO. NO, NO, NO.

17:49.799 --> 17:51.341
(chuckles) OH, MY GOD. NO.

17:51.341 --> 17:53.473
NO, IT IS NOT YOU.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.106
YOU ARE GREAT.

17:56.106 --> 17:58.578
YOU ARE NOT THE PROBLEM.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.351
OKAY. SO THEN...

18:01.351 --> 18:03.353
(sighs)

18:03.353 --> 18:05.485
OKAY, SO, UM... (sighs)

18:05.485 --> 18:08.288
SO YOU KNOW WHEN
THE DESSERT TRAY COMES AROUND,

18:08.288 --> 18:09.719
AND YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD SAY NO

18:09.719 --> 18:12.522
BECAUSE IT'S NOT NUTRITIOUS
AND IT'S FATTENING

18:12.522 --> 18:14.464
AND YOU JUST, YOU--YOU KNOW
YOU SHOULDN'T, BUT--

18:14.464 --> 18:16.095
BUT IT'S RIGHT THERE,

18:16.095 --> 18:19.229
AND IT'S SO BEAUTIFULLY MADE,

18:19.229 --> 18:21.731
AND IT LOOKS SO GOOD.

18:21.731 --> 18:23.473
AND YOU'VE--
YOU'VE HAD IT BEFORE,

18:23.473 --> 18:25.275
SO YOU JUST--YOU KNOW HOW...

18:25.275 --> 18:26.736
RIGHT.
DELICIOUS IT IS.

18:26.736 --> 18:30.680
AND IT'S JUST--
IT'S RIGHT THERE, YOU KNOW?

18:30.680 --> 18:33.513
I DO. YEAH, I KNOW.

18:33.513 --> 18:38.248
SO... SO YOU HAVE IT.
YOU HAVE THE DESSERT.

18:38.248 --> 18:39.419
(chuckles)

18:39.419 --> 18:42.222
AND IT IS DELICIOUS.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.653
I MEAN, IT IS...

18:43.653 --> 18:46.426
AN AMAZING DESSERT...

18:46.426 --> 18:49.429
IT IS... REALLY GOOD.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.561
FOR...

18:51.561 --> 18:52.902
A MOMENT,

18:52.902 --> 18:57.537
AND THEN YOU FEEL TIRED
AND BLOATED

18:57.537 --> 18:59.269
AND GASSY

18:59.269 --> 19:02.342
AND SO, SO GUILTY...
(sighs deeply)

19:02.342 --> 19:05.475
LIKE YOU JUST ERASED
ALL OF THE EXERCISE

19:05.475 --> 19:07.477
YOU HAVE EVER DONE,

19:07.477 --> 19:09.479
AND TOMORROW, YOU'RE GONNA WAKE
UP WITH ZITS ALL OVER YOUR FACE.

19:09.479 --> 19:13.283
AND JESUS IS SO DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU AGAIN.

19:13.283 --> 19:15.425
AND YOU JUST--
(door opens and closes)

19:17.557 --> 19:18.928
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

19:18.928 --> 19:20.430
HEY.
(Arizona)
Did you send the chart?

19:20.430 --> 19:21.591
(elevator bell dings)

19:21.591 --> 19:22.932
I DID, AN HOUR AGO.

19:22.932 --> 19:25.265
I TOLD MY INTERN TO LEAVE
THE COPIES BY THE DOOR.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.596
WELL, DID YOU TELL THEM
TO RING THE BELL?

19:26.596 --> 19:28.598
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT
THAT WAS A GIVEN,

19:28.598 --> 19:30.600
BUT THIS YEAR'S INTERNS

19:30.600 --> 19:31.671
seem more defective
than most.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.842
DID YOU TELL ME
TO LEAVE THE CHART--

19:32.842 --> 19:34.874
AH. SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE
SPOKEN TO.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.846
YEAH. UH, IT'S OUTSIDE
YOUR DOOR.

19:36.846 --> 19:38.578
FINE.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.580
(beeps)

19:42.181 --> 19:44.854
(woman) WOULD IT BE SAFE TO SAY
THAT THAT SURGERY,

19:44.854 --> 19:47.317
THE ONE DR. TORRES
PERFORMED ON YOUR HAND,

19:47.317 --> 19:50.960
WAS YOUR LAST HOPE AT REGAINING
YOUR SURGICAL CAREER?

19:52.622 --> 19:54.694
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.396
DR. TORRES, YOU'D AGREE

19:56.396 --> 19:57.967
THAT WITH THE FAILURE
OF THAT SURGERY,

19:57.967 --> 19:59.329
DR. SHEPHERD
WON'T BE ABLE TO--

19:59.329 --> 20:01.200
OKAY, I'M SORRY.
UH, JUST TO BE CLEAR,

20:01.200 --> 20:02.372
THE SURGERY DIDN'T FAIL.

20:02.372 --> 20:04.334
IT--IT WORKED.
THE GRAFT FAILED TO TAKE.

20:04.334 --> 20:06.236
TH-THAT WAS A RISK
WE WERE WILLING--

20:06.236 --> 20:08.308
BUT DR. SHEPHERD
CAN NO LONGER OPERATE.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.410
NO.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.711
WE'D HOPED WE'D GET
100% FUNCTION--

20:11.711 --> 20:13.583
AND IT'S EXPECTED THAT HE WILL
NEVER OPERATE AGAIN.

20:13.583 --> 20:14.844
UM, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

20:14.844 --> 20:16.686
BUT IF IT IS TRUE,

20:16.686 --> 20:19.789
AND YOU CAN HELP ESTABLISH
THAT AS A FACT,

20:19.789 --> 20:23.493
IT WOULD RAISE THE AWARD
TREMENDOUSLY, FOR EVERYONE.

20:25.555 --> 20:29.329
(siren wailing)

20:33.663 --> 20:34.634
(sighs)

20:37.437 --> 20:41.471
NO, IN MY OPINION, DR. SHEPHERD
WON'T OPERATE AGAIN.

20:44.914 --> 20:46.976
CAN WE TAKE A BREAK
FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE?

20:59.459 --> 21:01.631
(exhales)

21:11.901 --> 21:13.573
(exhales)

21:23.483 --> 21:25.615
(thuds)

21:25.615 --> 21:27.957
OKAY. (exhales)

21:37.597 --> 21:38.698
(prosthetic snaps)
AH!

21:38.698 --> 21:42.502
OW. OW! NO! AH.

22:00.590 --> 22:02.722
(inhales and exhales)

22:05.755 --> 22:07.727
(broken pieces clatter)

22:07.727 --> 22:09.759
(exhales)

22:09.759 --> 22:12.762
(pieces crackling)

22:20.670 --> 22:22.742
(exhales)

22:32.752 --> 22:33.723
(slams)

22:38.558 --> 22:39.989
I AM SO SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

22:39.989 --> 22:41.130
The stupid intern's
gonna hear about it, though.

22:41.130 --> 22:43.663
NO, IT'S JUST--
IT'S A HUGE...

22:43.663 --> 22:45.364
IT'S A HUGE WASTE
OF MY TIME!

22:45.364 --> 22:47.597
IT IS, AND I'M SORRY.

22:47.597 --> 22:48.938
I WILL FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT CHART

22:48.938 --> 22:50.440
AND GET IT RIGHT OVER TO YOU.
(cell phone beeps)

22:50.440 --> 22:51.601
I'M SORRY, BUT, DR. BAILEY,

22:51.601 --> 22:52.702
YOU NEVER TOLD ME TO DELIVER
ANY CHART.

22:52.702 --> 22:53.903
WHEN YOU ARE SPOKEN TO.

22:53.903 --> 22:56.846
(people speaking indistinctly)

22:56.846 --> 22:59.779
(elevator bell dings)

22:59.779 --> 23:01.010
(exhales)

23:01.010 --> 23:03.753
DR. YANG, LISTEN, IF YOU COULD
GIVE ME A-A FEW MINUTES.

23:03.753 --> 23:05.054
I REALLY DON'T HAVE
THE TIME OR THE NEED

23:05.054 --> 23:06.656
TO KEEP DRAGGING THIS OUT.

23:06.656 --> 23:08.758
I-I RESPECT THAT.
THAT--THAT'S FINE.

23:08.758 --> 23:10.560
BUT YOU WERE INVOLVED,

23:10.560 --> 23:12.061
AND YOUR STATEMENT COULD
BENEFIT YOUR COLLEAGUES

23:12.061 --> 23:13.423
AND THEIR FAMILIES.

23:13.423 --> 23:14.764
ANYTHING YOU COULD SAY
MIGHT BE HELPFUL.

23:14.764 --> 23:16.566
MY SHOULDER HURTS SOMETIMES.

23:16.566 --> 23:17.997
I MIGHT HAVE HAD
SOME P.T.S.D.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.429
YOU DID THROW THAT VASE
AT ME.

23:19.429 --> 23:22.171
(people speaking indistinctly)

23:22.171 --> 23:23.603
THAT IS HEARSAY...

23:23.603 --> 23:25.635
OR SOMETHING.
15 MINUTES.

23:25.635 --> 23:27.036
(monitor beeping erratically)
DR. YANG, DR. RUSSELL'S

23:27.036 --> 23:28.938
POST-OP AORTIC ULCER PATIENT'S
COUGHING UP BLOOD.

23:28.938 --> 23:30.109
DID YOU PAGE RUSSELL?

23:30.109 --> 23:31.441
HE'S IN SURGERY.
HE SAID TO PAGE YOU.

23:31.441 --> 23:33.443
MOUSEY, SUCTION.
SET UP FOR INTUBATION.

23:33.443 --> 23:35.445
(man coughing)

23:35.445 --> 23:37.116
THANK YOU.

23:37.116 --> 23:38.748
SAY SOMETHING THAT'LL
MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER.

23:38.748 --> 23:40.089
YOU'RE GONNA BE
JUST FINE, SIR.

23:40.089 --> 23:41.050
DON'T OVERSELL IT.

23:41.050 --> 23:42.421
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?

23:42.421 --> 23:45.054
COULD BE A FISTULA.
COULD BE A DISSECTION.

23:45.054 --> 23:47.126
WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL WE GET
MORE STUDIES AND OPEN HIM UP.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.498
YES!

23:48.498 --> 23:49.799
(suction gurgling)
SORRY.

23:49.799 --> 23:52.732
MOUSEY,
GET A REPEAT C.T., STAT.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.564
DOPEY, PREP AN O.R.
YOU GUYS ARE BOTH SCRUBBING IN.

23:54.564 --> 23:56.105
I NEED ALL HANDS.

23:56.105 --> 23:58.007
NOW.

23:58.007 --> 24:00.009
AND SOMEONE TELL RUSSELL
THAT I'M PROBABLY OPENING UP

24:00.009 --> 24:01.140
HIS AORTIC ULCER.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.512
SHE'S AWESOME.

24:02.512 --> 24:03.673
I LOVE HER.

24:03.673 --> 24:05.014
(bed motor whirs)

24:05.014 --> 24:06.846
GET THIS TO PATH.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.648
GET US AN ANSWER
AS QUICK AS YOU CAN.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.750
GOT IT.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.852
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:12.852 --> 24:15.485
SO I'M, UH,
WILLING TO COMPROMISE.

24:15.485 --> 24:17.056
I'M GONNA LET
THE CEILING THING GO.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.158
OKAY, AND LET THE OTHER
FOUR THINGS GO,

24:19.158 --> 24:20.129
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A DEAL.

24:20.129 --> 24:21.561
WE ALREADY HAVE A DEAL.

24:21.561 --> 24:23.192
WHY THE SUDDEN NEED
TO BE A HOMEOWNER, ALEX?

24:23.192 --> 24:25.094
WHY THE SUDDEN NEED
TO BE A BALLBUSTER?

24:25.094 --> 24:27.166
BECAUSE IT'S MY HOUSE.
SERIOUSLY, WHY NOW?

24:27.166 --> 24:29.198
I'VE BEEN SLEEPING AROUND
A LOT WITH INTERNS.

24:29.198 --> 24:31.240
AND YOU NEED MORE SPACE
FOR THAT?
I JUST, I--

24:31.240 --> 24:33.142
I'M STARTING TO WONDER
IF I'M GONNA BE THAT GUY

24:33.142 --> 24:34.744
WHO GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL

24:34.744 --> 24:37.747
WHO HANGS OUT IN HIS EL CAMINO
LOOKING TO NAIL THE FRESHMEN.

24:37.747 --> 24:39.048
I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT GUY.

24:39.048 --> 24:40.780
SO DON'T BE THAT GUY.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.011
I KNOW. I GOTTA GROW UP
A LITTLE.

24:42.011 --> 24:43.152
SO I STOPPED CALLING
THE INTERNS,
