04:03.661 --> 04:05.371
Look.

04:06.288 --> 04:07.456
Go.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.978
The Feather Raid.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.104
Begins.

04:30.105 --> 04:31.814
Hurray.

05:21.739 --> 05:22.781
Be careful.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.102
Down you go.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.029
You win.

06:04.948 --> 06:08.493
Mount Wudang is a mysterious place.

06:08.494 --> 06:11.455
Wind and snow happens in no time.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.706
Master.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.084
The new Head of Wudang.

06:15.501 --> 06:17.127
My pupil, Zhuo Yihang.

06:18.629 --> 06:19.713
Master.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.090
This must be a mistake.

06:21.423 --> 06:22.924
How could I be the new Head?

06:22.925 --> 06:26.762
The Feather Raid is a
trial for the new Head.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.179
But I lost.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.349
The result is not the key.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.309
The Raid is just a game.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.521
You sacrifice yourself for the big picture.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.773
That makes you the perfect leader.

06:38.065 --> 06:38.774
Master.

06:38.774 --> 06:39.525
Yihang.

06:39.526 --> 06:40.651
I'm not mature enough.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.486
I may not be fit for this duty.

06:42.653 --> 06:45.114
It is not about leading Wudang.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.573
It's about serving Wudang for life.

06:47.574 --> 06:48.117
Master.

06:48.117 --> 06:49.117
Get up.

06:49.618 --> 06:50.911
Yihang.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.914
Your grandfather is Zhuo Zhonglian.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.164
The governor of Chuan-Shan.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.041
That's right.

06:56.125 --> 06:57.458
So...

06:57.459 --> 06:59.753
The new Head is chosen.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.548
Let him submit the Red
Pills to His Majesty.

07:03.549 --> 07:04.133
Yes.

07:04.134 --> 07:05.634
His Majesty would love...

07:05.801 --> 07:07.844
to meet this new Head.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.471
We shall follow your advice.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.472
We'll prepare for the trip to the Palace.

07:11.473 --> 07:12.141
Good.

07:12.141 --> 07:12.975
Yihang.

07:12.976 --> 07:14.475
After submitting the Red Pills,

07:14.476 --> 07:16.645
you should visit your grandfather.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.689
Yes, Master.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.982
Submitting the Red Pills to His Majesty...

07:20.983 --> 07:22.651
is the utmost honor for Wudang.

07:24.528 --> 07:25.820
This is essential.

07:25.821 --> 07:27.781
You have to guard them well.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.577
The Freezing Light Sword.

07:31.743 --> 07:32.995
The icon of leadership.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.371
The spirit of Wudang.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.999
I'm giving it to you.

07:48.844 --> 07:49.845
Go.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.014
Move.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.557
Go.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.059
Thank you.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.648
He's handsome.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.857
Stop looking.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.581
If you say so.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.251
Lady, why do you strike to kill?

09:02.584 --> 09:04.504
Who told you to look at
something you shouldn't?

09:06.255 --> 09:07.673
I said stop.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.467
Why do you learn the
deadly Scroll of Apathy?

09:10.634 --> 09:11.802
You know nothing.

09:12.261 --> 09:13.345
Loveâ€œ.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.264
Is the deadliest poison.

09:15.305 --> 09:18.225
Did your lover hurt and disfigure you?

09:18.392 --> 09:19.601
Nonsense.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.824
I'm Zhuo Yihang from Wudang.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.660
My name is from the tale of Dharma.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.287
May I know your name, please?

10:21.163 --> 10:22.664
What name?

10:23.290 --> 10:24.666
I have none.

10:30.172 --> 10:31.340
Stop it.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.801
Should we meet again,

10:35.802 --> 10:37.804
I'd think of a perfect name for you.

10:40.015 --> 10:43.352
Look! Our relief supplies from the Palace.

10:46.897 --> 10:49.441
Zhuo Zhonglian, Governor of Chuan-Shan

10:49.691 --> 10:50.983
Food.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.195
Give us food.

10:53.695 --> 10:54.780
Come down.

10:55.197 --> 10:57.074
Drop it.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.039
How dare they steal the Imperial supplies?

11:04.373 --> 11:06.500
Arrest all the rioters. Get them.

11:11.213 --> 11:13.799
Jin Duyi, Deputy General of Chuan-Shan

11:18.053 --> 11:19.613
Murong Chong, Head of Chuan-Shan Guards

11:19.638 --> 11:20.764
What a gust.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.057
Captain Murong.

11:22.849 --> 11:23.892
What are you doing here?

11:24.059 --> 11:25.894
My duty is to arrest the Jade Rakshasa.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.231
You're just a puny guard.

11:29.398 --> 11:31.441
How dare you be in my path?

11:31.942 --> 11:33.151
General Jin.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.070
My duty is to arrest...

11:35.237 --> 11:36.780
criminals wanted by the Palace.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.329
This is under the watch
of the Chuan-Shan army.

11:41.535 --> 11:42.744
You have no value here.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.913
Leave.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.763
If he doesn't need us,

12:02.764 --> 12:03.932
let him be.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.057
Nonsense.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.268
How can I forgo my duty?

12:08.270 --> 12:09.938
His Majesty needs that girl alive.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.190
How?

12:12.524 --> 12:14.109
We'll wait.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.412
Bow to the Prince.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.998
Clear the path.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.611
His Majesty is not well.

12:58.612 --> 12:59.821
He's not to be bothered.

12:59.905 --> 13:01.155
Leave the Red Pills.

13:01.156 --> 13:02.824
Envoy of Wudang,

13:02.949 --> 13:04.242
you may go.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.581
Your Excellency.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.880
Wei Zhongxian

13:29.434 --> 13:30.519
Your Majesty.

13:30.852 --> 13:31.978
Your Majesty.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.482
His Majesty has passed away.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.859
In 1620,

13:38.860 --> 13:41.529
Emperor Guangzhong was poisoned
after 29 days on the throne.

13:41.530 --> 13:44.199
Chaos ensued from the infamous
"Case of the Red Pills".

14:01.383 --> 14:02.676
Kneel.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.012
Bow once.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.056
Rise.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.059
Bow twice.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.520
Rise.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.356
Bow thrice.

14:16.898 --> 14:21.987
Long live Your Majesty.

14:28.577 --> 14:29.911
What next?

14:31.204 --> 14:32.080
Calling.

14:32.081 --> 14:34.583
Head of Secret Squad.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.628
Here's your order.

14:39.629 --> 14:40.922
Arrest...

14:41.006 --> 14:42.924
...Zhuo Yihang of Wudang.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.302
Yes.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.567
Fort Luna.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.068
Strategically built on the hilltop.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.149
Jade Rakshasa and her gang
called it "Lunar Kingdom".

15:11.953 --> 15:14.623
My master is conducting
business at the capital.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.624
If you allow us to pass
through your fortress,

15:16.625 --> 15:18.417
all these treasures are yours.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.628
You need not know...

15:19.961 --> 15:21.171
anything else.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.131
Jade Rakshasa?

15:23.673 --> 15:24.966
Look at him.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.635
You're next.

15:27.177 --> 15:28.637
No good will come to you,

15:29.554 --> 15:31.139
if you don't tell the truth.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.607
Who sent you?

15:41.608 --> 15:43.193
We're real businessmen.

15:45.487 --> 15:46.987
It's Huang Taiji, Prince of Jin.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.031
Your Excellency.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.659
Once we capture Fort Luna,
we march straight to the Palace.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.534
But Fort Luna is protected by the cliff.

15:52.535 --> 15:53.994
A direct attack is not optimal.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.038
Huang Taiji of Aisin Gioro

15:57.666 --> 15:59.334
Go and tell Huang Taiji.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.002
This road...

16:01.127 --> 16:02.127
is closed.

16:04.339 --> 16:05.339
Sister.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.382
Coral.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.009
Escort them down the hill.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.803
Use the gold to trade for some food.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.054
Give the food to the starving people.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.346
Yes.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.146
Report from our scout.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.566
A Jin platoon is marching
from the northwest.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.194
They seemingly can avoid our defense line.

16:28.530 --> 16:31.700
We have a traitor in the army.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.200
Find this traitor...

16:33.201 --> 16:34.411
with all endeavors.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.546
Release all the rioters.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.505
Yes.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.054
Get up.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.180
Up. Governor is setting you free.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.557
Wake up.

16:56.558 --> 16:57.434
Sir.

16:57.435 --> 16:58.559
Their bodies have turned cold.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.436
All dead.

16:59.437 --> 17:00.562
It's a plague.

17:00.645 --> 17:01.312
Come.

17:01.313 --> 17:02.355
<i>An assassin.</i>

17:06.401 --> 17:07.859
Quick! Over there.

17:07.861 --> 17:08.569
Get her.

17:08.570 --> 17:10.488
We need her alive.

17:15.076 --> 17:16.076
Bastard.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.203
Go to Hell.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.101
Bastard.

17:40.435 --> 17:41.755
If you mistreat the people again,

17:41.770 --> 17:43.104
I will take your life.

17:50.653 --> 17:51.905
I respect you,

17:52.906 --> 17:54.908
but I have to kill you.

17:55.617 --> 17:57.284
We are outnumbered. What to do?

17:57.285 --> 17:58.285
Go.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.128
Come.

18:08.129 --> 18:09.464
General...

18:11.424 --> 18:12.926
Don't let her go.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.823
General, we will avenge Governor Zhuo.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.661
Lock down all paths to Fort Luna.

18:39.828 --> 18:42.204
Arrest Jade Rakshasa.

18:42.205 --> 18:43.331
Yes.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.249
Hand over Zhuo Yihang.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.792
Ask my sword.

18:46.793 --> 18:47.918
Stand down.

18:47.919 --> 18:49.670
How dare you disobey His Majesty?

18:49.671 --> 18:51.172
Mind your manners.

18:53.174 --> 18:54.175
Head.

18:56.594 --> 19:00.181
We'd like to accompany the Secret Squad
to find Yihang.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.225
We'll prove Wudang's innocence.

19:03.184 --> 19:04.184
OK.

19:10.859 --> 19:12.277
Give us food.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.237
There's food.

19:14.237 --> 19:15.237
Give me some.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.509
Gentlemen.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.720
Are you cooking?

19:39.220 --> 19:40.597
May I have some?

19:41.222 --> 19:42.557
This kid is starving.

19:54.235 --> 19:55.319
Isn't this human bone?

19:55.320 --> 19:56.445
How can you burn it?

19:56.446 --> 19:58.907
Too busy surviving to care for the dead.

19:59.908 --> 20:00.950
Back off.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.244
Back off. Leave.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.913
Are you deaf?

20:05.246 --> 20:06.246
Go.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.250
Come on.

20:09.250 --> 20:09.959
Leave.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.043
Kneel.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.462
What now?

20:14.005 --> 20:15.256
Quiet.

20:15.465 --> 20:17.967
These men rob the supplies.
They'll be executed.

20:18.509 --> 20:19.928
They only took some rice.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.347
And you're accusing them of robbing?

20:22.680 --> 20:23.556
These are relief supplies.

20:23.557 --> 20:25.558
Their lives are worth less than rice?

20:25.850 --> 20:27.352
Yes.

20:27.435 --> 20:28.770
For a handful of rice,

20:28.937 --> 20:30.270
how could you kill without mercy?

20:30.271 --> 20:31.731
- What? Shut up.
- That's right.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.288
Jade Rakshasa is here.

20:59.342 --> 21:00.468
Get them.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.098
Back off.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.477
Coral.

21:24.659 --> 21:25.785
Arrows.

21:27.412 --> 21:28.413
Shoot

21:31.499 --> 21:32.500
Shoot

21:47.473 --> 21:49.684
You're here to rescue, not kill.

22:01.446 --> 22:02.530
Get her.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.489
There.

22:06.367 --> 22:07.493
Get on.

22:18.880 --> 22:19.881
Go.

22:20.715 --> 22:21.716
Freeze.

22:21.883 --> 22:22.884
Go.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.609
Rakshasa, freeze.

22:41.402 --> 22:42.528
You want to die?

22:42.862 --> 22:44.530
Come on if you like to die.

22:44.906 --> 22:46.616
Go.

22:47.867 --> 22:48.951
Go.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.543
Why let her go?

22:57.710 --> 22:59.420
A chance to get near her.

23:09.430 --> 23:10.431
Go.

23:13.768 --> 23:14.936
Get on.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.440
Go.

23:25.196 --> 23:26.906
Freeze.

23:27.115 --> 23:28.783
Soldiers, stop them.

23:29.909 --> 23:30.909
Freeze.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.246
What a pity.

23:33.496 --> 23:34.956
We let her go.

23:35.456 --> 23:36.624
General.

23:37.083 --> 23:37.959
General.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.044
Do we really let her go?

23:40.253 --> 23:41.504
No worries.

23:41.921 --> 23:42.963
In a few days,

23:42.964 --> 23:45.466
Fort Luna will be destroyed by the plague.

24:09.866 --> 24:12.702
Coral is back.

24:14.537 --> 24:15.620
Coral.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.165
We thought you found a husband.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.666
Who would want her?

24:19.667 --> 24:21.502
Unless she captures one.

24:48.863 --> 24:50.531
Don't wake my daughter.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.200
Why aren't you sleeping?

24:53.201 --> 24:54.160
Captain.

24:54.161 --> 24:55.161
Do we act tonight?

24:55.286 --> 24:57.914
Tonight? You want to be carried out?

24:58.039 --> 24:59.540
Why am I being carried out?

25:00.583 --> 25:01.959
Because you'd be dead.

25:03.544 --> 25:05.588
Go and check the landscape first.

25:06.047 --> 25:07.215
Then?

25:07.715 --> 25:10.885
Then, we wait, wait and wait.

25:11.093 --> 25:12.553
Yes, Captain.

26:04.647 --> 26:06.899
If you like to stay, you help.

26:06.983 --> 26:09.735
We'll escort those who don't stay.

26:11.946 --> 26:12.946
Hunter.

26:12.947 --> 26:14.240
Your daughter is sick.

26:15.700 --> 26:16.820
How many patients like this?

26:16.867 --> 26:18.619
More than a dozen today.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.246
Typhoid fever.

26:21.831 --> 26:23.291
If it's typhoid fever,

26:23.624 --> 26:25.626
we have to burn their bodies.

26:25.751 --> 26:26.751
Or else,

26:26.752 --> 26:28.087
the fort is done.

26:29.130 --> 26:30.089
Coral.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.299
What is it?

26:34.302 --> 26:35.761
Typhoid fever.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.138
Take them to the lakeside.

26:38.139 --> 26:39.640
Get the pine oil and torches.

26:40.141 --> 26:41.641
They're burning us alive.

26:41.642 --> 26:43.644
Let us go.

26:43.811 --> 26:44.645
Quiet.

26:44.646 --> 26:45.730
Please.

26:47.732 --> 26:49.108
I learnt medicine in Wudang.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.401
I could cure them.

26:50.651 --> 26:52.820
I can't risk the lives of everyone...

26:53.112 --> 26:54.237
in this fort.

26:54.238 --> 26:55.865
Gather all the patients here.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.118
Even those who were in contact with them.

26:59.660 --> 27:00.953
Give me three days.

27:01.704 --> 27:02.913
If I fail,

27:03.122 --> 27:04.332
I'll die With them.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.167
You won't be infected.

27:10.463 --> 27:11.797
Line up.

27:11.922 --> 27:12.840
One by one.

27:12.841 --> 27:14.007
The tusu wine that you need.

27:14.008 --> 27:15.051
Fairy drop.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.468
Snow water from deep Winter.

27:16.469 --> 27:17.949
Morning dew from first day of Spring.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.013
For the rest,

27:20.014 --> 27:21.682
look for them in the Infernal Cave.

27:25.478 --> 27:26.686
What?

27:26.687 --> 27:28.147
You're lost too?

27:28.230 --> 27:29.857
This is forbidden area.

27:30.024 --> 27:31.484
I've never come here.

27:32.860 --> 27:35.071
We could die here if we're lost.

27:35.237 --> 27:36.447
Go.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.499
Our guide will be here.

27:48.334 --> 27:48.876
Look.

27:48.877 --> 27:50.168
Here's our guide.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.045
You speak wolf?

27:51.046 --> 27:53.381
I was raised by wolves.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.349
Where are we?

28:04.016 --> 28:05.016
So serene.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.060
Breathtaking.

28:07.353 --> 28:08.396
It's the border beyond.

28:10.064 --> 28:12.066
The army of Jin is hiding there.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.902
They want to invade through here.

28:16.737 --> 28:18.739
Serenity won't last forever.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.785
You won't let them through.

28:29.417 --> 28:30.751
Let's go.

28:34.755 --> 28:37.425
Head of Secret Squad is here.

28:40.094 --> 28:41.803
Deputy General Jin Duyi...

28:41.804 --> 28:43.764
at your service.

28:47.893 --> 28:50.271
May I ask why you're here?

28:50.896 --> 28:52.898
To capture the wanted criminal,

28:53.065 --> 28:54.442
Zhuo Yihang.

28:59.447 --> 29:00.573
Mr. Zhuo.

29:00.906 --> 29:01.782
Yihang.

29:01.783 --> 29:05.077
He's taken by the Jade Rakshasa.
His life is in danger.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.413
I heard,

29:08.122 --> 29:10.415
she murdered Governor Zhuo.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.333
Yes.

29:11.334 --> 29:13.544
This dart is from the Governor's corpse.

29:13.794 --> 29:14.919
It belongs to her.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.797
The Nonagon Dart.

29:17.882 --> 29:19.425
We have to save Yihang.

29:20.134 --> 29:23.011
Fort Luna is built to defend.

29:23.012 --> 29:26.098
We would have taken it if it's easy.

29:26.307 --> 29:28.309
A simple fort,

29:28.809 --> 29:30.269
cannot stop us.

29:30.352 --> 29:31.437
Farewell.

29:31.896 --> 29:33.022
Sir.

29:33.814 --> 29:34.857
If you like,

29:34.940 --> 29:36.149
the Chuan-Shan army...

29:36.150 --> 29:37.484
would be glad to help.

29:37.485 --> 29:38.943
The Secret Squad needs no help.

29:38.944 --> 29:39.944
There's no need,

29:39.945 --> 29:40.945
General Jin.

29:49.455 --> 29:50.831
Up there.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.135
These herbs can fight typhoid fever.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.895
Lian Nishang (Silk Fairy).

30:20.361 --> 30:21.529
Have you forgotten?

30:21.862 --> 30:23.864
I promise you a pretty name.

30:24.865 --> 30:27.201
A pretty name for a pretty girl.

30:27.910 --> 30:29.160
In this world,

30:29.161 --> 30:30.281
nobody deserves this name...

30:30.913 --> 30:32.998
other than you.

30:41.090 --> 30:42.675
That day on the hill.

30:42.883 --> 30:44.593
I saw you playing the flute.

30:45.219 --> 30:46.679
You stood in the breeze.

30:47.096 --> 30:49.890
Your belt fluttered like
silk; you, like a fairy.

30:50.391 --> 30:51.934
Beautiful.

30:52.226 --> 30:53.477
Let me tell you.

30:54.061 --> 30:55.563
If you can't save Fort Luna,

30:56.063 --> 30:57.523
I'll take your life in a heartbeat.

31:07.533 --> 31:08.909
Lian Nishang.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.953
I won't give you the chance.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.216
Could the medicine...

31:25.217 --> 31:27.052
stop the typhoid fever?

31:27.344 --> 31:28.929
If it fails,

31:29.221 --> 31:30.973
we have to kill them all.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.998
Is the medicine ready?

31:56.999 --> 31:57.958
Ready.

31:57.959 --> 31:59.126
Take them over there.

32:19.021 --> 32:20.564
Why do you think,

32:21.231 --> 32:22.231
love...

32:22.316 --> 32:24.109
is the deadliest poison?

32:26.278 --> 32:27.488
My master said so.

32:28.781 --> 32:30.699
She fell for a man years ago.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.285
They were engaged secretly.

32:34.662 --> 32:36.497
But that man betrayed her.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.666
She was devastated.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.710
She never saw him again.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.301
This is a token of their love.

32:50.010 --> 32:51.178
Actually,

32:52.012 --> 32:53.013
Hatred...

32:53.347 --> 32:54.807
is also poison.

32:55.015 --> 32:56.350
If you let hatred go,

32:56.684 --> 32:58.727
life will be much better.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.147
I hate the man who tormented my master.

33:33.804 --> 33:35.222
I'm hungry-

33:36.265 --> 33:37.516
You're hungry?

33:38.058 --> 33:39.218
I've saved some food for you.

33:42.396 --> 33:43.396
Come.

33:44.565 --> 33:45.858
Come. One more.

33:46.108 --> 33:48.861
I'm hungry too. Let me have some.

33:49.570 --> 33:51.363
He's hungry too.

33:52.239 --> 33:54.241
Brothers, there are lots of food.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.658
I'll show you.

33:55.659 --> 33:57.285
Let's go.

33:57.286 --> 33:58.579
Let's eat.

33:59.079 --> 34:00.371
They're all hungry.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.415
Give us food.

34:57.805 --> 34:59.138
This is the Kong Ming Lantern.

34:59.139 --> 35:01.475
If you miss someone,

35:02.309 --> 35:04.186
set the lantern up in the sky.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.146
That person will know.

35:06.313 --> 35:07.314
Yes.

35:19.243 --> 35:20.828
Make a wish to the ones you miss.

35:21.245 --> 35:22.538
They can hear you.

35:23.580 --> 35:24.164
Good.

35:24.164 --> 35:25.164
Yes.

36:04.371 --> 36:05.873
Thanks for saving them.

36:06.206 --> 36:07.374
Or else,

36:08.709 --> 36:10.210
they'll all die.

36:10.252 --> 36:12.212
You're not heartless.

36:18.552 --> 36:20.596
You don't know everything.

36:23.557 --> 36:24.557
Oh.

36:26.351 --> 36:27.853
I like that name.

36:33.233 --> 36:34.276
Lian Nishang.

38:14.751 --> 38:15.836
Nishang.

38:16.461 --> 38:17.461
Yes.

38:17.838 --> 38:19.756
Come and meet my grandfather.

38:23.844 --> 38:24.928
Why?

38:25.345 --> 38:27.597
He's the only family I have.

38:28.515 --> 38:30.475
I'm sure he'd like you.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.482
Will we come back?

38:38.150 --> 38:39.359
Sure.

38:39.776 --> 38:42.362
This is my Lunar Kingdom too.

38:58.170 --> 38:59.379
I promise.

39:40.754 --> 39:41.838
Who's there?

39:42.589 --> 39:44.424
Give us Yihang.

39:44.591 --> 39:45.966
Breaking into Fort Luna?

39:45.967 --> 39:47.052
You're dead.

39:51.515 --> 39:52.474
Masters.

39:52.475 --> 39:53.558
Yihang.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.518
You've been held captive indeed.

39:55.519 --> 39:56.436
Zhuo Yihang.

39:56.437 --> 39:58.563
You murdered His Majesty with Red Pills.

39:58.814 --> 40:00.732
Come to the Palace with me for justice.

40:00.774 --> 40:02.109
Or everyone in Wudang...

40:02.442 --> 40:03.567
will be executed.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.570
Go With him.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.447
Clear Wudang's name.

40:07.781 --> 40:09.908
The authority doesn't care about justice.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.535
How could you clear your name?

40:12.702 --> 40:14.788
If you try to get anyone out of here,

40:15.580 --> 40:16.790
there will be blood.

40:16.957 --> 40:17.957
Witch.

40:18.041 --> 40:19.126
If you interfere with the Secret Squad,

40:19.209 --> 40:20.544
I'll level Fort Luna.

40:20.627 --> 40:21.627
Just try.

40:25.465 --> 40:27.050
Hold it. Stop.

40:32.472 --> 40:33.598
She's not a witch.

40:34.641 --> 40:36.268
Her name is Lian Nishang.

40:36.935 --> 40:38.687
And she's my woman.

40:39.271 --> 40:40.564
I'm here...

40:41.148 --> 40:42.649
to protect her.

40:42.816 --> 40:43.817
This witch...

40:43.942 --> 40:45.819
murdered your grandfather.

40:45.986 --> 40:47.612
Why don't you avenge him?

40:47.821 --> 40:48.821
What did you say?

40:51.199 --> 40:52.492
Grandfather is dead?

40:52.659 --> 40:53.618
She did it.

40:53.619 --> 40:54.953
You're framing her.

40:55.162 --> 40:56.621
We didn't kill him.

41:03.003 --> 41:04.253
I didn't kill your grandfather.

41:04.254 --> 41:05.589
We have proof.

41:06.506 --> 41:08.300
This is your own dart.

41:08.633 --> 41:09.885
Stop lying-

41:10.177 --> 41:11.595
You witch.

41:11.845 --> 41:13.513
Why are you seducing our leader?

41:13.680 --> 41:14.848
What do you want?

41:15.307 --> 41:16.016
Yihang.

41:16.016 --> 41:17.016
Take the sword.

41:28.695 --> 41:29.988
It's my dart.

41:30.155 --> 41:31.865
But I didn't kill your grandfather.

41:38.622 --> 41:40.081
Don't you trust me?

41:43.710 --> 41:46.004
If you have the slightest doubt,

41:47.631 --> 41:48.882
Zhuo Yihang.

41:52.177 --> 41:54.137
Then I shouldn't be yours.

41:58.642 --> 42:01.228
You won't regret being my woman.

42:01.561 --> 42:04.063
But I must find the real murderer.

42:04.064 --> 42:05.649
Wudang is in trouble.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.068
I must go.

42:09.569 --> 42:10.737
Nishang.

42:11.738 --> 42:13.031
Wait for me.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.658
I'll be back.

43:01.288 --> 43:02.372
Your Majesty.

43:02.664 --> 43:04.082
The culprit of the Red Pills.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.960
Zhuo Yihang has been captured.

43:07.252 --> 43:08.211
Wow.

43:08.212 --> 43:11.172
This carving is magnificent.

43:13.800 --> 43:14.968
It's alright.

43:15.385 --> 43:17.345
It's spectacular.

43:17.929 --> 43:18.972
Your Majesty.

43:20.140 --> 43:23.184
The Wudang elders have been kneeling
for four hours.

43:25.854 --> 43:27.188
You take care of it.

43:28.231 --> 43:29.649
Yes.

43:34.779 --> 43:36.281
Don't worry.

43:36.698 --> 43:39.075
The real culprit of the Red Pills...

43:39.159 --> 43:40.785
will be found.

43:40.827 --> 43:42.829
Thanks, Your Excellency.

44:07.354 --> 44:08.772
We've come to this.

44:08.938 --> 44:11.274
Someone has to take the fall.

44:11.691 --> 44:14.694
Either Yihang or the entire Wudang.

44:15.695 --> 44:17.697
Wudang must live on.

44:18.156 --> 44:19.908
But sacrificing Yihang,

44:20.033 --> 44:21.785
knowing he's innocent,

44:22.160 --> 44:24.078
Wudang will live in shame.

44:24.079 --> 44:26.038
Aiya, my friend.

44:26.039 --> 44:27.165
You...

44:29.376 --> 44:31.294
You are here,

44:31.711 --> 44:34.214
to let Wudang take the blame.

44:34.798 --> 44:35.840
Yes.

44:36.091 --> 44:37.300
You promise?

44:37.717 --> 44:39.135
Yes.

44:39.803 --> 44:40.387
Alright.

44:40.388 --> 44:43.056
Please report to His Majesty,

44:43.723 --> 44:45.850
Wudang is innocent.

44:46.226 --> 44:48.727
Wudang is magnanimous.

44:48.728 --> 44:50.021
Sure.

44:50.438 --> 44:52.065
Oh no.

45:11.209 --> 45:12.292
Isn't this...

45:12.293 --> 45:15.380
the Wudang envoy with the Red Pills?

45:20.927 --> 45:22.804
Who are you?

45:22.929 --> 45:24.431
Who are you then?

45:24.931 --> 45:27.892
Xiong Tingbi, Military
Minister of Liaodong.

45:28.893 --> 45:30.437
Zhuo Yihang from Wudang.

45:32.772 --> 45:33.773
Ting.

45:34.941 --> 45:37.235
Get the Top Scholar candy.

45:37.902 --> 45:39.028
Yes.

45:41.197 --> 45:45.160
Why are you unharmed here?

45:45.285 --> 45:47.078
Because they need me.

45:47.245 --> 45:48.871
If I'm still alive,

45:48.872 --> 45:52.083
they could use me to
threaten Wudang and the world,

45:52.167 --> 45:54.252
forcing them to obey the eunuchs.

45:54.335 --> 45:55.879
But I'd rather die,

45:56.004 --> 45:57.881
than to join the eunuchs.

45:57.964 --> 45:59.299
You can't die.

46:01.968 --> 46:04.804
Everyone knows about the
Red Pills incident.

46:05.138 --> 46:08.933
But there must be a
transition in everything.

46:09.017 --> 46:11.144
The Palace has been kind to Wudang.

46:11.936 --> 46:13.228
In times like this,

46:13.229 --> 46:17.817
we hope the Head of Wudang can help.

46:17.942 --> 46:20.153
What would Your Excellency need?

46:20.487 --> 46:21.988
Please let me know.

46:22.489 --> 46:24.824
Xiong has been contacting the Jin clan,

46:25.950 --> 46:27.619
to rebel against the Palace.

46:28.828 --> 46:30.497
He's been executed.

46:30.830 --> 46:32.999
If you could take his head...

46:33.166 --> 46:35.835
...to Xiong's men,

46:36.294 --> 46:39.589
to warn them not to rebel.

46:43.927 --> 46:46.846
You'll no longer be seen as a suspect.

46:47.013 --> 46:49.349
You're the key...

46:49.974 --> 46:51.309
...to Wudang's future.

46:57.524 --> 46:58.858
I agree.

47:17.043 --> 47:19.003
I almost forgot,

47:20.588 --> 47:23.049
your master Ziyang has passed away.

47:25.885 --> 47:27.178
There's a bright side to this.

47:28.221 --> 47:31.891
Nobody will be telling you what to do.

47:35.603 --> 47:36.938
Yihang.

47:39.065 --> 47:40.567
Are you married?

47:41.067 --> 47:43.903
I've sworn to serve Wudang all my life.

47:45.238 --> 47:46.573
Let me tell you a secret.

47:46.990 --> 47:48.074
I had a family,

47:48.241 --> 47:49.534
before I became a eunuch.

47:50.076 --> 47:51.911
I have a daughter.

48:00.253 --> 48:01.921
Her name is Tingting.

48:02.422 --> 48:05.425
This is Zhuo Yihang, Head of Wudang.

48:08.094 --> 48:10.054
These are nice snacks.

48:10.597 --> 48:12.432
Take them to Xiong's man, Yuan Chonghuan,

48:12.932 --> 48:15.435
as reward from the Palace.

48:31.951 --> 48:32.744
Master.

48:32.745 --> 48:34.078
Are you going to Liaodong?

48:34.162 --> 48:35.162
Yes.

48:35.288 --> 48:36.247
Do you know,

48:36.248 --> 48:37.956
General Xiong is a patriot?

48:37.957 --> 48:38.958
I do.

48:39.125 --> 48:40.125
Do you know,

48:40.126 --> 48:40.960
Wudang...

48:40.961 --> 48:43.171
has never done any harm.

48:43.338 --> 48:44.338
I do.

48:44.339 --> 48:45.632
Why are you still going?

48:46.090 --> 48:47.008
Fine.

48:47.009 --> 48:48.133
You want to go?

48:48.134 --> 48:49.594
You'll have to get past us.

48:49.677 --> 48:50.677
Go.

48:54.766 --> 48:55.767
Stop.

48:56.267 --> 48:57.267
Stand down.

48:58.311 --> 48:59.311
Yes.

48:59.312 --> 49:00.605
The Red Pills case.

49:00.980 --> 49:02.481
Wudang left me to die.

49:02.482 --> 49:04.609
You are aware of this.

49:05.652 --> 49:07.195
From now on,

49:07.654 --> 49:09.154
I'm no longer with Wudang.

49:09.155 --> 49:10.990
We don't owe each other.

49:12.367 --> 49:13.493
This sword.

49:14.202 --> 49:15.328
I'm returning it.

49:16.454 --> 49:17.664
From today,

49:17.997 --> 49:19.999
whatever I do or say,

49:21.000 --> 49:23.336
is no longer your business.

49:24.253 --> 49:25.253
Go.

49:32.470 --> 49:33.470
Zhuo Yihang.

49:33.471 --> 49:36.515
You're now a stranger to Wudang.

49:36.516 --> 49:38.184
Why are you doing this?

49:38.267 --> 49:39.519
You can't die.

49:40.520 --> 49:41.688
If you die,

49:42.021 --> 49:44.398
Wudang will forever be associated with...

49:44.399 --> 49:47.068
the murder of His Majesty.

49:47.735 --> 49:48.778
The Palace...

49:49.070 --> 49:50.363
is full of corrupt officials.

49:50.530 --> 49:53.032
The Jin army is at our border.

49:53.282 --> 49:54.701
It's a matter of life and death...

49:55.159 --> 49:57.161
for our nation.

49:57.537 --> 50:00.039
Wudang is nothing compared to it.

50:00.540 --> 50:02.375
I've written a book on strategies.

50:03.543 --> 50:05.044
"The Profile of Liaodong".

50:05.503 --> 50:08.047
It's my life's work.

50:08.131 --> 50:09.840
It documented my men's experience,

50:09.841 --> 50:12.051
fighting against the Jin army.

50:12.343 --> 50:15.304
Follow the strategies in the book,

50:15.430 --> 50:16.556
the Jin army...

50:16.597 --> 50:18.850
will never cross our border.

50:19.058 --> 50:21.644
No matter how many troops they send.

50:22.061 --> 50:23.187
Yihang.

50:23.688 --> 50:25.189
Please.

50:41.080 --> 50:43.124
Yuan Chonghuan, Superintendent of Liaodong.

50:43.416 --> 50:45.626
Here to greet the Royal Envoy.

50:55.261 --> 50:56.387
Please have tea.

50:56.804 --> 50:57.804
Put it there.

50:57.889 --> 51:01.100
I'm here to deliver snacks
on behalf of His Excellency.

51:01.893 --> 51:04.145
Top Scholar candy from the Palace.

51:04.270 --> 51:05.605
Minister Xiong.

51:06.773 --> 51:08.608
He's my mentor.

51:11.360 --> 51:13.112
I wonder,

51:13.446 --> 51:15.615
if this would whet your appetite.

51:22.747 --> 51:24.456
The Top Scholar candy tastes good,

51:24.457 --> 51:25.750
but can be very sticky.

51:26.709 --> 51:28.127
Have a bite,

51:28.419 --> 51:29.629
and your career...

51:29.754 --> 51:32.131
will be attached to the Palace.

51:35.885 --> 51:37.219
I hope General Yuan...

51:37.220 --> 51:40.473
...would hang Xiong's head above the camp.

51:40.515 --> 51:42.140
Don't decline the kindness...

51:42.141 --> 51:44.142
from His Excellency.

51:44.143 --> 51:45.144
This way,

51:45.269 --> 51:48.272
you could stay in Liaodong.

51:50.191 --> 51:51.317
Do you understand?

51:53.152 --> 51:54.152
I do.

51:56.489 --> 51:59.158
If you do, why don't you speak up?

52:06.207 --> 52:07.542
Yuan Chonghuan,

52:09.168 --> 52:10.169
will accept.

52:10.962 --> 52:12.171
Yihang.

52:12.421 --> 52:16.843
You'll be blamed for delivering my corpse.

52:17.176 --> 52:18.469
I'm sorry.

52:18.553 --> 52:19.678
Zhuo Yihang.

52:19.679 --> 52:22.389
You're now a stranger to Wudang.

52:22.390 --> 52:23.850
Why?

52:24.767 --> 52:28.312
If I could avenge my master's death
and rid of the eunuchs,

52:28.479 --> 52:30.189
I'll take it.

52:30.523 --> 52:32.692
Yihang is on Wei's side now.

52:33.192 --> 52:34.317
He brought Xiong's head,

52:34.318 --> 52:35.695
to warn Liaodong.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.655
Wei even said,

52:38.197 --> 52:39.198
when Yihang comes back,

52:39.866 --> 52:41.868
he'd marry Wei's daughter.

52:42.201 --> 52:43.744
He told me he'd come back.

52:44.495 --> 52:45.454
I trust him.

52:45.455 --> 52:46.789
Men like him,

52:47.206 --> 52:48.791
are not worth waiting.

52:52.211 --> 52:54.547
Don't forget what your master went through.

52:55.548 --> 52:58.009
That heartless man has ruined you.

52:58.217 --> 52:59.886
You must forget him.

53:00.011 --> 53:01.721
Don't make my mistakes.

53:14.734 --> 53:15.902
It's late.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.446
My veil should be lifted.

53:29.624 --> 53:31.334
There's someone else in my heart.

54:33.062 --> 54:34.939
You told me you'd return.

54:36.399 --> 54:37.942
You asked me to wait for you.

54:40.027 --> 54:41.362
Why didn't you keep your promise?

54:48.077 --> 54:49.412
You still don't trust me.

54:52.373 --> 54:54.709
You think I killed your grandfather.

54:58.629 --> 55:00.339
Is it because of her?

55:09.849 --> 55:11.350
Zhuo Yihang.

55:14.353 --> 55:16.647
You want to marry this woman?

55:17.648 --> 55:18.858
Yes.

55:21.360 --> 55:22.570
I want to marry her.

55:30.828 --> 55:32.663
I was wrong about you.

55:34.373 --> 55:35.916
From now on,

55:36.959 --> 55:38.711
we don't owe each other.

56:02.526 --> 56:04.694
Don't forget what your master went through.

56:04.695 --> 56:08.114
Love is the deadliest poison.

56:08.115 --> 56:09.408
Stop.

56:11.869 --> 56:13.537
Who are you? I'm asking you.

56:14.497 --> 56:15.748
Speak.

56:18.918 --> 56:19.919
Come on.

56:20.419 --> 56:21.545
There's an intruder.

56:37.812 --> 56:39.563
What's going on?

56:42.483 --> 56:43.567
Nishang.

56:43.609 --> 56:44.609
Wait for me.

56:44.693 --> 56:46.112
I'll be back.

56:47.446 --> 56:49.657
You want to marry this woman?

56:50.616 --> 56:51.784
Yes.

57:17.768 --> 57:18.811
Hit her.

58:17.536 --> 58:18.329
Anyone touches her again,

58:18.330 --> 58:19.622
I'll kill him.

58:19.914 --> 58:21.206
She may be an assassin.

58:21.207 --> 58:22.541
Let her go.

58:24.168 --> 58:25.294
<i>Miss,</i>

58:26.003 --> 58:28.671
if His Excellency finds out...

58:28.672 --> 58:29.715
I said, let her go.

58:29.882 --> 58:31.258
Get out.

58:51.570 --> 58:52.905
Take her with you.

59:07.628 --> 59:08.671
Wait.

59:22.601 --> 59:24.061
Why did you marry me?

59:24.270 --> 59:26.063
I need to kill someone.

59:26.772 --> 59:28.065
My father?

59:28.107 --> 59:29.608
To avenge my master's death,

59:30.734 --> 59:32.361
and for the nation.

59:32.945 --> 59:34.905
But you haven't killed him yet.

59:35.656 --> 59:37.296
You're afraid Wudang would be implicated.

59:37.408 --> 59:39.618
So you've been waiting for a chance.

59:41.745 --> 59:42.746
Zhuo Yihang.

59:43.789 --> 59:45.624
My father became a eunuch,

59:45.916 --> 59:48.419
so he could pay for my freedom.

59:48.627 --> 59:51.088
He's been suffering all these years for me.

59:52.131 --> 59:53.966
I don't care how everybody sees him.

59:54.008 --> 59:56.135
Nor how everybody sees me.

59:56.760 --> 59:58.929
My father loves me with all his heart.

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.266
I'm begging you.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.643
Don't hurt him.

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:06.353
Would you?

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:25.455
I have failed you.

01:00:25.456 --> 01:00:27.166
I should be punished.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:32.004
Seeing you after praying...

01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:33.839
ruins my day.

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:42.805
Please let us clear our guilt,

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:44.850
by leveling Wudang and killing Zhuo.

01:00:48.354 --> 01:00:52.816
A lovesick man is no leader.

01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:55.778
Let him be.

01:00:55.903 --> 01:00:58.697
Wudang has close ties with the Palace.

01:01:00.032 --> 01:01:02.368
With Ziyang taking the fall,

01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:05.162
let's be forgiving.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:07.706
Your Excellency is too kind.

01:01:08.082 --> 01:01:09.291
I'll obey.

01:01:19.385 --> 01:01:20.719
Dad.

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:23.847
Did that witch hurt you?

01:01:27.393 --> 01:01:29.269
Yihang blocked it for me.

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.022
Don't feel bad.

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:35.733
He doesn't deserve you.

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:38.278
Who wouldn't want to marry my daughter?

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.867
A man whose heart isn't with me,

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:46.036
should be let go.

01:01:47.788 --> 01:01:49.748
I just don't want this...

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:52.084
to ruin your mood.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.102
Move.

01:02:11.103 --> 01:02:12.270
What happened?

01:02:12.271 --> 01:02:13.439
Zhuo Yihang.

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:15.107
How's Jade Rakshasa?

01:02:16.984 --> 01:02:18.944
Why didn't you stop her?

01:02:21.155 --> 01:02:22.823
Cure her quickly.

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:24.992
Yihang.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:28.077
You need the Udumbara to save her.

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:29.078
Where is it?

01:02:29.288 --> 01:02:31.123
The Infernal Cave.

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:34.376
Return before the incense burns out.

01:03:26.595 --> 01:03:27.971
Master.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:31.850
Do you remember the Scroll of Apathy?

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:34.144
I do.

01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:37.523
Once you've learnt it,

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:39.650
your power would be elevated.

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:41.443
Nothing can harm you.

01:03:41.652 --> 01:03:43.904
You will never need to be rescued.

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:46.031
Follow my words.

01:03:58.877 --> 01:03:59.877
Master.

01:03:59.878 --> 01:04:00.879
No.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:02.004
<i>L.</i>

01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:04.883
I can't.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:07.678
I can't continue.

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:09.388
You still can't let go.

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:12.975
Loveâ€œ.

01:04:13.559 --> 01:04:16.228
Is the deadliest poison.

01:04:17.229 --> 01:04:18.438
But hatred,

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.025
isn't it a poison too?

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:24.027
You still don't understand.

01:04:25.571 --> 01:04:27.281
The only one you can rely on,

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:30.033
is yourself.

01:04:35.122 --> 01:04:36.248
Master.

01:04:37.416 --> 01:04:38.584
Master.

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:19.518
It's fate.

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:51.633
Nishang.

01:06:52.384 --> 01:06:53.552
Don't be scared.

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:55.345
I'll be with you.

01:06:57.389 --> 01:06:59.182
We'll never be apart.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.238
Yihang.

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:12.189
You're the first thing that I see.

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:19.238
It's too good to be true.

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:22.701
If love is the deadliest poison,

01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:25.620
for you,

01:09:26.955 --> 01:09:29.666
I'll take it without hesitation.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.403
Your Royal Highness.

01:09:58.737 --> 01:10:02.782
Huang Taiji is leading the
Yellow and Blue clans.

01:10:03.033 --> 01:10:04.451
They're on the way.

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:07.287
Ask him to meet me outside the border.

01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:08.914
On January 6th, at dawn,

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:10.582
I'll take down Fort Luna,

01:10:10.916 --> 01:10:12.959
and reunite with our Jin warriors.

01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:15.544
Take this blade.

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:16.838
Bring it to Huang.

01:10:19.257 --> 01:10:20.383
Tell him,

01:10:22.302 --> 01:10:23.929
my father gave his to me.

01:10:24.596 --> 01:10:26.306
It's been sharpened for a decade.

01:10:27.933 --> 01:10:29.267
Time to sheathe.

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:31.727
Yes.

01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:34.773
The Jin army is ferocious.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.274
With our manpower in Fort Luna,

01:10:37.275 --> 01:10:38.944
we do not stand a chance.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:41.404
This is a critical time for our nation.

01:10:41.446 --> 01:10:43.280
Let's forgo our differences,

01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:44.658
and work with the Palace.

01:10:45.325 --> 01:10:46.325
Elder.

01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:49.453
We have never worked with the officials.

01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:51.456
It's our ancestors' rule.

01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:52.958
But this time,

01:10:55.335 --> 01:10:57.295
we have to break the rule.

01:10:58.296 --> 01:10:59.631
Yes.

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:03.343
The Chuan-Shan troops followed
my grandfather for years.

01:11:04.386 --> 01:11:05.303
Let me convince them.

01:11:05.304 --> 01:11:06.470
We're here, Yihang.

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:07.471
Yihang.

01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:08.807
We're wrong about you.

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:10.809
We'll fight with you.

01:11:10.976 --> 01:11:11.976
Master.

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:13.311
Yihang.

01:11:14.104 --> 01:11:15.480
You've sacrificed yourself,

01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:17.399
for the bigger picture.

01:11:17.649 --> 01:11:18.929
Here's the Freezing Light Sword.

01:11:19.109 --> 01:11:20.360
It's yours.

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:22.779
Yihang.

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:24.823
You're weakened by the Udumbara poison.

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:26.116
I'll go with you.

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:31.663
If Fort Luna and the army join forces,

01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:34.499
the Jin troops will never cross the border.

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:36.667
I can lead our troops,

01:11:36.668 --> 01:11:39.379
flank to the back and surround the enemy.

01:11:39.546 --> 01:11:41.006
This will drive them off.

01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:42.340
But,

01:11:43.508 --> 01:11:45.342
it takes five days,

01:11:45.343 --> 01:11:48.013
to climb these mountains.

01:11:48.763 --> 01:11:50.932
There's a passage behind Fort Luna,

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:53.810
it'll lead to the back of the enemies.

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.021
Good.

01:11:57.022 --> 01:12:00.483
You should engage them at the front.

01:12:00.525 --> 01:12:02.694
I'll get to their back.

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:04.154
Give them a surprise.

01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:05.363
Time is of the essence.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:06.698
We'll go at dawn.

01:12:07.365 --> 01:12:08.408
Put the linen sacks there.

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:09.658
Put them inside.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:10.368
Good.

01:12:10.368 --> 01:12:11.368
Any more?

01:12:11.453 --> 01:12:11.995
No.

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:12.995
Good.

01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:20.545
Sir.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:24.049
Looks like it's time to go.

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:28.510
We're not arresting her?

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:30.889
If we get her,

01:12:31.056 --> 01:12:33.058
who's defending the people here?

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:34.726
We have a common enemy.

01:12:34.893 --> 01:12:36.728
Not the time to be
fighting among ourselves.

01:12:37.729 --> 01:12:40.065
What if she runs away?

01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:42.692
What if she dies for our country?

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:56.164
You're here.

01:12:56.456 --> 01:12:58.083
I've been looking for you.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.423
Do you know why?

01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:07.759
Becauseâ€œ.

01:13:08.218 --> 01:13:09.594
Because I'm leaving.

01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:12.931
It means,

01:13:13.223 --> 01:13:14.557
I won't come back.

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:18.186
Will you miss me?

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:19.561
Yes.

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:20.897
Really?

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:22.732
How much?

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:28.113
This much?

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:38.456
I'll miss you very much.

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.128
See you later.

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:47.173
Thanks for trusting me.

01:13:54.472 --> 01:13:55.807
If you miss me,

01:13:55.974 --> 01:13:57.600
light a lantern.

01:13:57.809 --> 01:13:59.644
I will see it.

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:04.667
General Jin.

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:06.878
Our time is tight.

01:15:07.545 --> 01:15:10.089
Any delay and our nation will fall.

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:16.595
Attention, Chuan-Shan army.

01:15:16.596 --> 01:15:17.639
Yes.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.807
Take over Fort Luna.

01:17:13.671 --> 01:17:16.799
Your fencing is akin to horseback attack.

01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:18.343
You're from the Jin clan.

01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:20.719
Nishang only wounded my grandfather.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.305
But you took the chance to kill him.

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.682
Then control his troops.

01:17:25.183 --> 01:17:26.851
You're taking over Fort Luna,

01:17:26.893 --> 01:17:29.145
to let the Jin troops in.

01:17:39.906 --> 01:17:41.699
For your grandfather's sake,

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:43.910
I won't kill you.

01:17:45.203 --> 01:17:46.162
Sis.

01:17:46.163 --> 01:17:48.039
Why aren't our troops here?

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.709
Jade Rakshasa.

01:17:52.043 --> 01:17:53.836
Jade Rakshasa.

01:17:54.337 --> 01:17:55.337
Go.

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.381
Go.

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:04.847
No.

01:18:04.889 --> 01:18:06.224
Fort Luna is in trouble.

01:18:06.808 --> 01:18:07.392
Sis.

01:18:07.517 --> 01:18:08.517
Go back.

01:18:08.726 --> 01:18:09.811
I'll guard here.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.401
Be careful.

01:18:19.737 --> 01:18:20.905
Go.

01:20:58.646 --> 01:20:59.689
Yihang.

01:21:04.277 --> 01:21:05.277
Nishang.

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:06.696
Just go.

01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:08.531
Just go.

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:10.366
Jade Rakshasa.

01:21:11.909 --> 01:21:13.494
I've been waiting.

01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:15.454
Turn yourself in.

01:21:15.913 --> 01:21:16.913
Jin Duyi.

01:21:16.914 --> 01:21:18.082
To catch me,

01:21:18.249 --> 01:21:19.916
you would endanger the country...

01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:22.086
and kill hundreds of us?

01:21:24.922 --> 01:21:26.007
You've brought this...

01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:27.925
to yourself.

01:21:29.427 --> 01:21:30.177
Come.

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:31.386
Take her.

01:21:31.429 --> 01:21:32.430
Yes.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.481
Just go.

01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:24.732
Just go.

01:22:25.191 --> 01:22:26.275
Leave me.

01:24:27.605 --> 01:24:28.605
Go.

01:24:28.773 --> 01:24:29.774
Go.

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:32.233
Captain.

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:37.530
Captain.

01:24:39.825 --> 01:24:41.118
Captain.

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:42.411
Fort Luna has fallen.

01:24:44.163 --> 01:24:45.247
Our troops invaded it.

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:47.123
They went mad and killed everyone.

01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:48.459
Even elders and children.

01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:50.628
Weren't they fighting together?

01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:52.505
Let's go back.

01:24:52.505 --> 01:24:53.130
You can't go.

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:53.798
Move.

01:24:53.798 --> 01:24:54.798
Captain.

01:24:59.136 --> 01:25:00.137
The lantern.

01:25:00.930 --> 01:25:02.222
It's her.

01:25:02.223 --> 01:25:03.223
She's alive.

01:25:03.349 --> 01:25:04.475
There's hope.

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:05.809
Get on your horses.

01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:07.144
- Get on.
- Captain.

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:08.812
Jin Duyi has planned this.

01:25:08.813 --> 01:25:10.356
He has many troops.

01:25:10.648 --> 01:25:11.816
We're outnumbered.

01:25:11.857 --> 01:25:13.651
We'll perish.

01:25:14.235 --> 01:25:15.444
Go and get help.

01:25:16.278 --> 01:25:17.278
Go.

01:25:17.404 --> 01:25:18.404
Go.

01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:20.156
Yihang.

01:25:20.157 --> 01:25:21.200
Do you know?

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:24.161
The first day I saw you,

01:25:25.913 --> 01:25:28.207
my life became colorful.

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:30.793
Knowing you,

01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:35.339
has taught me the meaning of longing.

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:41.846
Would we feel anything after death?

01:25:43.681 --> 01:25:45.224
Would we remember,

01:25:46.684 --> 01:25:48.686
whom we love?

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:51.856
If we both die now,

01:25:53.858 --> 01:25:55.276
then nobody would know,

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:59.655
how in love we have been.

01:26:03.576 --> 01:26:05.703
By learning the Scroll of Apathy,

01:26:06.203 --> 01:26:08.664
you'll have the power to keep him alive.

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:10.374
Do you accept?

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.251
I do.

01:26:13.210 --> 01:26:14.295
You do?

01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:17.923
What do you mean?

01:26:19.216 --> 01:26:20.217
Afterwards,

01:26:20.384 --> 01:26:22.011
you'll forget everything.

01:26:22.344 --> 01:26:24.346
You will love him no more.

01:26:24.388 --> 01:26:26.557
Do you accept?

01:26:27.516 --> 01:26:28.851
I don't.

01:26:30.728 --> 01:26:32.396
But I have no choice.

01:26:33.564 --> 01:26:35.024
What are you saying?

01:26:47.995 --> 01:26:49.455
If one day,

01:26:52.625 --> 01:26:53.918
I get old,

01:26:55.252 --> 01:26:57.588
and I've lost my memory.

01:26:58.255 --> 01:26:59.256
Promise me.

01:27:00.925 --> 01:27:02.676
You must remember for me.

01:27:04.053 --> 01:27:05.304
Agree?

01:27:06.347 --> 01:27:07.598
I promise.

01:27:11.769 --> 01:27:13.812
If one day, you can't remember anything.

01:27:17.566 --> 01:27:20.694
I'll tell you our story, once a day.

01:27:22.279 --> 01:27:23.405
Every day.

01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:25.950
Every month.

01:27:27.451 --> 01:27:28.619
Every year.

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:31.747
Forever.

01:27:33.624 --> 01:27:35.417
If one day,

01:27:38.003 --> 01:27:41.298
you chances upon a ferocious woman.

01:27:42.466 --> 01:27:44.093
Don't blame her.

01:27:44.802 --> 01:27:46.303
What are you doing?

01:27:47.012 --> 01:27:48.472
You must know,

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.477
that's not her intention.

01:27:53.644 --> 01:27:55.312
Are you learning the Scroll?

01:27:56.105 --> 01:27:57.439
No.

01:27:59.817 --> 01:28:01.652
You can't do it.

01:28:02.444 --> 01:28:04.321
You're mine.

01:28:05.656 --> 01:28:08.450
Revenge is not worth your forgetting me.

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:12.997
I just want you to live.

01:28:13.664 --> 01:28:15.416
I do not want you to forget me.

01:28:19.753 --> 01:28:21.839
If we can't be together,

01:28:24.758 --> 01:28:26.844
what's the point of living?

01:28:45.029 --> 01:28:47.531
1626, Nurhaci led 130,000 men
to attack Ningyuan City,

01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:49.056
but was defeated by Yuan Chonghuan.

01:28:49.450 --> 01:28:50.367
Report.

01:28:50.368 --> 01:28:52.410
General, the enemy is retreating.

01:28:52.411 --> 01:28:54.496
Shall we follow them?

01:28:55.039 --> 01:28:56.040
No.

01:28:56.707 --> 01:28:58.499
We follow the "Profile of Liaodong".

01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:59.668
We stay put.

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:09.427
We've got Fort Luna.

01:29:09.428 --> 01:29:11.055
Why aren't the troops marching in?

01:29:12.598 --> 01:29:13.890
We have learnt,

01:29:13.891 --> 01:29:15.559
Yuan changed his strategies.

01:29:15.726 --> 01:29:17.019
We suffered a huge defeat.

01:29:17.186 --> 01:29:18.437
Father was injured.

01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:19.688
Is he alright?

01:29:19.772 --> 01:29:20.898
Don't worry.

01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:22.690
However, Yuan Chonghuan...

01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:25.027
is pressing on with his cavalry.

01:29:25.402 --> 01:29:26.402
Hetuala is in danger.

01:29:26.403 --> 01:29:27.946
I'm rushing back.

01:29:28.906 --> 01:29:30.199
I'll go with you, brother.

01:29:30.407 --> 01:29:32.408
If we join forces, we'll defeat Yuan.

01:29:32.409 --> 01:29:33.409
No.

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.663
You need to stay here.

01:29:37.664 --> 01:29:39.750
Ally with the eunuchs.

01:29:39.917 --> 01:29:41.085
When the time comes,

01:29:41.668 --> 01:29:42.586
you turn Fort Luna over...

01:29:42.587 --> 01:29:44.088
to Wei Zhongxian.

01:29:44.546 --> 01:29:45.422
When that happens,

01:29:45.423 --> 01:29:46.465
Yuan will be...

01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:48.509
dealt with by their own people.

01:29:51.553 --> 01:29:52.553
Huang Taiji.

01:29:56.558 --> 01:29:58.143
Is this our father's order,

01:29:58.519 --> 01:30:00.104
or your own?

01:30:01.939 --> 01:30:04.525
Our clan needs you here.

01:30:07.778 --> 01:30:08.946
Do you know,

01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:12.116
how I've spent the past decade?

01:30:13.575 --> 01:30:15.077
I can't be a Jin.

01:30:15.452 --> 01:30:16.787
I'm not a Han.

01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:18.455
I've betrayed everyone.

01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:21.792
Why should I suffer like this?

01:30:22.084 --> 01:30:25.546
I know you want to be a
warrior like our father.

01:30:25.754 --> 01:30:27.089
You've done good.

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:31.802
Keep going.

01:30:33.095 --> 01:30:35.597
I just want to be like you.

01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:37.890
A warrior with glory,

01:30:37.891 --> 01:30:39.475
and die in my homeland.

01:30:39.476 --> 01:30:40.644
Don't forget,

01:30:40.811 --> 01:30:42.479
without our father's order,

01:30:42.521 --> 01:30:43.814
you cannot leave.

01:30:46.608 --> 01:30:48.819
Our clan needs you here.

01:30:48.944 --> 01:30:49.987
You and I,

01:30:50.279 --> 01:30:51.655
we have our own destiny.

01:32:29.253 --> 01:32:30.587
<i>L.</i>

01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:35.342
Will wait for that day.

01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:23.200
All of you.

01:34:26.119 --> 01:34:27.746
You've killed so many.

01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:29.373
Tell me now.

01:34:29.706 --> 01:34:31.375
Who murdered Governor Zhuo?

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:32.500
Who did it?

01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:33.877
Anybody?

01:34:34.211 --> 01:34:36.004
You've sworn to serve the Palace.

01:34:36.088 --> 01:34:37.798
But you're not killing our enemies.

01:34:37.923 --> 01:34:39.382
You're killing the innocent.

01:34:39.383 --> 01:34:41.176
You're following a traitor.

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:43.720
Soldiers.

01:34:43.721 --> 01:34:44.805
Yes.

01:34:45.722 --> 01:34:46.848
Let's go.

01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:48.892
Good.

01:34:49.226 --> 01:34:51.228
What happened, is forgetten.

01:36:09.806 --> 01:36:11.975
This woman is bewitched.

01:36:12.184 --> 01:36:13.977
She cannot recognize you.

01:36:14.478 --> 01:36:15.937
This is your fate.

01:36:21.610 --> 01:36:23.111
It's destiny.

01:36:23.487 --> 01:36:25.279
Just like your grandfather.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.990
You would be killed by me.

01:36:42.839 --> 01:36:44.508
Don't you remember me?

01:36:46.843 --> 01:36:47.844
Nishang.

01:36:51.848 --> 01:36:53.183
I'm Zhuo Yihang.

01:36:54.518 --> 01:36:56.019
The first time we met,

01:36:57.854 --> 01:36:59.481
was at Yellow Dragon Cave.

01:37:00.899 --> 01:37:02.651
You didn't have a name.

01:37:03.527 --> 01:37:04.611
You said love,

01:37:04.903 --> 01:37:07.155
was the deadliest poison.

01:37:08.156 --> 01:37:09.991
At the hilltop,

01:37:10.659 --> 01:37:12.994
I saw you playing the flute.

01:37:14.329 --> 01:37:16.373
Your belt fluttered in the breeze.

01:37:16.957 --> 01:37:17.999
Your dress...

01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:20.043
So beautiful.

01:37:20.919 --> 01:37:22.254
I was thinking,

01:37:24.297 --> 01:37:25.549
your name would be,

01:37:28.051 --> 01:37:30.178
Lian Nishang.

01:37:55.912 --> 01:37:57.914
Die with me.
