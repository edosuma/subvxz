WEBVTT

00:03.394 --> 00:05.048
Do I know you?
Masahun.

00:05.092 --> 00:06.702
Masahun found a new game.

00:06.745 --> 00:09.226
The lone female,
he figured I'd be the weakest,

00:09.270 --> 00:10.749
so he forced me to choose.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.490
Made you chose what?Who died next.

00:12.534 --> 00:14.362
Anshiri, King or Hale.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.190
I should have saved them.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.495
VANCE:
His name is Nigel Hakim,

00:17.539 --> 00:19.889
and is working as a guest
out of their embassy.

00:19.932 --> 00:22.065
Who would have him as a guest?
Don't they know who he is?

00:22.109 --> 00:24.024
They seem to know him
as a humanitarian.

00:24.067 --> 00:26.330
Deputy Ambassador
Sybil Rigg, Mr. Hakim.

00:26.374 --> 00:28.811
Just say one word
for me-- infidels.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.291
To indulge this
delusion would be...

00:30.334 --> 00:32.423
Just say it!

00:32.467 --> 00:33.859
VANCE:
I just left the British embassy.

00:33.903 --> 00:36.427
I told the deputy ambassador
that Hakim is Masahun.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.168
She believe it this time?No, but she did say that

00:38.212 --> 00:39.300
Hakim was spooked enough
to charter a flight

00:39.343 --> 00:40.823
back to London this evening.

00:40.866 --> 00:42.216
Your passenger--
get him out here!

00:42.259 --> 00:43.695
Guy booked another charter
out of Reagan.

00:43.739 --> 00:48.700
You killed so many of
my brothers. Infidel.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.642
Oh, that's cute, old man.
Take your best shot.

01:23.518 --> 01:26.825
That wasn't even close
to my best shot, young man.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.316
I've been nothing
but good to you.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.492
Why would you want
to leave us?

01:41.536 --> 01:45.148
Your food is too salty.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.932
You do look
a little bloated.

01:46.976 --> 01:49.239
Or maybe it's the weight
you've put on

01:49.283 --> 01:52.242
since we first crossed paths.

01:52.286 --> 01:54.288
Why don't you refresh my memory?

01:58.030 --> 02:02.470
The sadistic pig.
I remember now.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.820
I could neverforget you.

02:04.863 --> 02:07.388
The man who killed my brothers.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.479
I can understand
Agent Sloane's reaction,

02:11.522 --> 02:13.829
seeing me after all these years.

02:13.872 --> 02:17.876
I had the exact same one when
I saw you again in your office.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.661
Well, you've got a great
poker face.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.406
HAKIM:
Yes.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.366
Unlike Sloane,

02:29.410 --> 02:31.194
I chose to wait for my moment,

02:31.238 --> 02:34.110
which, as it
turns out...

02:34.154 --> 02:36.068
...is now.
WOMAN:
Hakim?

02:36.112 --> 02:37.548
Put that down.

02:37.592 --> 02:39.594
There's been enough violence.

02:39.637 --> 02:42.553
Zaiyema, he killed my
brothers, he killed your...

02:42.597 --> 02:44.251
We are at war, Hakim.

02:44.294 --> 02:46.078
That is what happens.

02:46.122 --> 02:48.603
But it is time
to stop the violence,

02:48.646 --> 02:50.561
not perpetuate it.

02:50.605 --> 02:52.476
And I believe

02:52.520 --> 02:54.652
there are many good Americans

02:54.696 --> 02:56.611
who feel the same way.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.178
We can use him.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.657
Good luck with that.I think

02:59.701 --> 03:02.573
with the proper... incentive...

03:04.053 --> 03:06.273
...you will come
to see our side of things.

03:06.316 --> 03:08.753
And if he doesn't?

03:08.797 --> 03:11.321
Then you can do
whatever you want with him.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.543
♪

03:46.443 --> 03:48.271
He disappeared a few weeks ago.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.577
His vehicle was never recovered.

03:49.620 --> 03:52.406
Sorry. I don't...
I don't know him.

03:52.449 --> 03:53.755
Sure about that, Joey?

03:53.798 --> 03:56.758
Oh, sure as sugar, Mr. G-Man.

03:56.801 --> 04:01.589
Okay, then, what are you doing
driving around with his rims?

04:01.632 --> 04:03.417
JOEY:
Well...

04:03.460 --> 04:04.983
actually, it's a...Hey.

04:05.027 --> 04:06.289
Got a minute?Nope.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.073
Uh, it's just that I have

04:08.117 --> 04:10.075
these pipette requisition forms

04:10.119 --> 04:11.599
that reallyneed
to be signed

04:11.642 --> 04:13.601
and since you are
acting director

04:13.644 --> 04:16.821
till we find the real one...

04:16.865 --> 04:19.694
Hear this guy might know
where Hakim is hiding Vance.

04:19.737 --> 04:22.000
No, he doesn't.How can you tell?

04:22.044 --> 04:24.438
JOEY: ...like, 300 large.
Didn't have the cash.

04:24.481 --> 04:25.613
Never mind.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.092
...then he noticed

04:27.136 --> 04:29.878
that I liked his
new rims, so...

04:29.921 --> 04:31.445
You got the rims from Markie D.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.316
Yup.
Okay.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.578
Do you know where
Markie D got the rims?

04:34.622 --> 04:35.927
I didn't ask.

04:35.971 --> 04:38.321
I'm just trying
to keep my nose clean

04:38.365 --> 04:40.715
while I take my
real estate exam.I'm gonna arrest you now.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.325
Chop shop, 12th and Elm,

04:42.369 --> 04:44.806
passcode at the door is
"gummies."

04:44.849 --> 04:46.373
He may not know
where Vance is,

04:46.416 --> 04:48.810
but hey, at least
you got a lead.

04:48.853 --> 04:50.986
Didn't sign my thing.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.031
There you are. I have
been trying to text you.

04:53.075 --> 04:54.119
Did you turn your
cell off again?

04:54.163 --> 04:56.121
I am done
signing things today.

04:56.165 --> 04:59.429
Well, it's my job to make sure
that you sign things, but...

04:59.473 --> 05:01.170
Vance. Vance. Not me.

05:01.213 --> 05:03.346
He can play catch-up
when he gets back, okay?

05:03.390 --> 05:05.217
That's what I was
texting you about.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.785
Agent Torres is calling
from Afghanistan.

05:07.829 --> 05:10.005
He's got news.

05:10.048 --> 05:13.574
Four weeks. Four weeks
I've been in this hellhole.

05:13.617 --> 05:16.141
Also how long
it's been since I've slept.

05:16.185 --> 05:18.143
What do you got?Well, a desert rash,

05:18.187 --> 05:20.929
a fungus on my big toe and
it's so dusty I can't wax my...

05:20.972 --> 05:21.930
About Vance.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.542
Gibbs, so I've been following
the director's trail

05:25.586 --> 05:27.544
all over the country and, uh...

05:27.588 --> 05:29.285
"And, uh..." what?

05:29.329 --> 05:30.939
I don't think he's here.

05:30.982 --> 05:34.595
One of the embeds picked up
chatter that suggests

05:34.638 --> 05:36.684
the Kabul landing
was a decoy.

05:36.727 --> 05:38.076
Hakim faked us.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.296
Yeah, well, that damn plane
is somewhere.
Hello?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.558
From what we gather,

05:41.602 --> 05:44.039
Vance might never have even
left the States.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.389
I would look for another year,
no doubt about it.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.739
BISHOP: Copy that.But I don't think
I'm gonna find him.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.698
Uh, I think we just did.

05:50.741 --> 05:53.265
GIBBS:
Bishop?

05:53.309 --> 05:54.615
NEWSWOMAN: Four men
robbed a local Virginia bank

05:54.658 --> 05:55.964
this morning.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.705
Investigators
have now released...

05:57.748 --> 05:58.923
What am I looking at?

05:58.967 --> 06:00.316
...of the incident
with the hopes that...

06:00.360 --> 06:01.665
This.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.537
Torres.

06:03.580 --> 06:04.712
You seeing this?

06:04.755 --> 06:06.975
Is, uh, that...

06:07.018 --> 06:08.977
Director Vance?

06:09.020 --> 06:10.544
Yup.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.075
GIBBS:
That looks like Leon.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.816
KASIE: Well, that's
either the director

06:21.859 --> 06:24.209
or aliens created
a perfect clone.

06:24.253 --> 06:25.559
I just saw the news.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.212
Hakim's group
is taking credit.

06:27.256 --> 06:29.606
Ah. Oh, my God, it's really him.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.216
Or a perfect clone.Right?

06:31.260 --> 06:32.696
Yeah, I kind of
buy that more.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.916
SLOANE: Well, clearly,
Leon was forced into this

06:34.959 --> 06:38.136
and he's not one
to bend easily.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.356
I can't even imagine what
Hakim's done to him.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.140
What's Hakim's endgame?

06:42.184 --> 06:43.751
Humiliation

06:43.794 --> 06:47.232
His endgame is always
chaos and pain.

06:47.276 --> 06:49.800
And I led him
right to Vance.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.019
It's not your fault.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.673
Forget it, Gibbs.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.414
If I just hadn't
overreacted

06:54.457 --> 06:56.198
when I first
saw Hakim, I...

06:56.241 --> 06:57.460
I would've done
the same thing.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.331
Instead of losing my cool,

06:59.375 --> 07:01.203
I should've bided my time

07:01.246 --> 07:03.423
and stalked that man
like the monster he is

07:03.466 --> 07:05.207
and put him down
like a rabid dog.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.775
Course we might diverge
a little in the end there.

07:07.818 --> 07:09.341
I won't make that mistake again.

07:09.385 --> 07:11.343
I promise you that.

07:11.387 --> 07:14.695
Daily observation five:

07:14.738 --> 07:17.741
never get on Agent Sloane's
bad side.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.834
Wait, so what exactly was
Torres upset he couldn't wax?

07:23.878 --> 07:25.488
I don't know, McGee.
He didn't get that far.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.316
He'll be back tonight.
You can ask him yourself.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.274
Yeah, but...Okay, I'm a
little uncomfortable

07:29.318 --> 07:30.972
this is the part of the story
that you're focusing on.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.322
You must be Agents McGee
and Bishop.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.237
Myron Holt. Bank manager.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.631
I assume you're not
here to rob us, as well.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.110
No, Mr. Holt.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.242
And we are just as
confused as you are

07:40.285 --> 07:42.157
about our director's
role in this.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.376
Yeah, we're hoping you can shed
some light on what happened.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.117
It's not that complicated.

07:46.161 --> 07:49.294
Four weeks ago, we received this
court order to freeze the assets

07:49.338 --> 07:50.818
of Nigel Hakim's charity--

07:50.861 --> 07:52.515
over $5 million
in bearer bonds--

07:52.559 --> 07:54.735
and consolidate them
in this branch.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.693
So, Hakim is after his money.

07:56.737 --> 07:58.478
He also made off with
an additional $2 million

07:58.521 --> 08:00.349
in gold bullion from our vault.

08:00.392 --> 08:02.525
Director Vance ordered this
right before he disappeared.

08:02.569 --> 08:05.136
Which means he was one
of the few people who knew

08:05.180 --> 08:06.181
the bonds were here.

08:06.224 --> 08:08.531
Funny that.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.185
So, where was he
during the robbery?

08:10.228 --> 08:12.535
He stayed out there
to watch the customers.

08:12.579 --> 08:15.364
Fired a few warning shots
to any would-be heroes.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.453
Hakim trusted him with a gun.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.498
Funny that.

08:19.411 --> 08:20.325
Again.

08:20.369 --> 08:22.284
Look, whatever is going on,

08:22.327 --> 08:24.242
our director was not
a willing participant.

08:24.286 --> 08:27.724
Yeah. I totally got that
by the way he robbed my bank.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.900
Now, if you'll
excuse me...

08:31.989 --> 08:34.209
You think that's why Hakim
kidnapped the director?

08:34.252 --> 08:36.298
Because he knew where
Hakim's money was?

08:36.341 --> 08:37.734
I hope not.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.170
Hakim's got his money,

08:39.214 --> 08:41.390
so what happens
to Vance?

08:41.433 --> 08:44.001
Well, they're all
waiting for you

08:44.045 --> 08:45.568
and I still need you to sign...

08:45.612 --> 08:47.004
Vice Admiral, please.I've ordered every...

08:47.048 --> 08:48.658
What if we're just playing
into their hands

08:48.702 --> 08:50.268
and we don't even
know it, Admiral?

08:50.312 --> 08:51.661
We have to assume that Director
Vance has been compromised.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.576
I disagree completely.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.360
Well, I presume that
we've changed any and all

08:55.404 --> 08:57.841
cyber security codes that
Director Vance had access to?

08:57.885 --> 09:00.627
Yes, as well as recall any
covert agents whose identities

09:00.670 --> 09:02.106
he could compromise.That's not...

09:02.150 --> 09:04.326
Do you have a list of that
you could copy my government?

09:04.369 --> 09:05.501
Hey!Special Agent Gibbs,

09:05.545 --> 09:07.198
we were just discussing the...

09:07.242 --> 09:09.070
Your next move
to find Leon Vance?

09:09.113 --> 09:10.245
No, actually.

09:10.288 --> 09:11.899
The man just robbed a bank.

09:11.942 --> 09:14.118
That has national security
implications.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.598
You can't let
your personal involvement

09:15.642 --> 09:17.252
cloud your judgment.Oh, no. Don't do it.

09:17.295 --> 09:18.296
Excuse me for a second, sir.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.429
"Personal involvement"?

09:20.472 --> 09:21.691
You mean how
Nigel Hakim

09:21.735 --> 09:23.475
relentlessly tortured me
for months?

09:23.519 --> 09:25.260
Is that what you mean?I heard about that.

09:25.303 --> 09:27.523
Agent Sloane,
it's no one's intention

09:27.567 --> 09:29.264
to denigrate
your situation.

09:29.307 --> 09:31.005
Oh, come on,
don't even go there.

09:31.048 --> 09:34.008
I tried to tell you that you
were harboring a known terrorist

09:34.051 --> 09:35.270
and you called me crazy.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.532
Yeah, I heard that, too.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.490
You protected him.RIGG:
And I was wrong.

09:38.534 --> 09:41.493
Since that time, I've done
everything within my power

09:41.537 --> 09:42.364
to set it right.

09:42.407 --> 09:43.931
I have worked
night and day

09:43.974 --> 09:46.063
to locate Director Vance

09:46.107 --> 09:47.717
and I'm in contact
with Interpol to flag

09:47.761 --> 09:50.328
any attempt by Hakim to move
the stolen gold bullion.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.026
But beyond that,

09:52.069 --> 09:53.941
all I can offer is my apologies.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.789
You are the worst texter
in the world.

10:17.529 --> 10:18.922
She made me come here.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.403
I ask for news about my dad
and get something back

10:21.446 --> 10:24.493
about an admiral
and gold bullion.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.408
Punctuation, it's your friend.

10:26.451 --> 10:27.888
I thought you had
a school thing tonight.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.280
I gave up.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.978
It's not easy rushing a sorority

10:31.021 --> 10:33.067
with a balding, middle-aged man
following you around.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.372
No offense, Rod.

10:34.416 --> 10:35.678
It's the sad truth.

10:35.722 --> 10:41.075
Not to mention your dad on TV,
robbing banks.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.469
You gonna come in?

10:47.385 --> 10:49.561
Well?

10:49.605 --> 10:51.172
What happened at the meeting?

10:51.215 --> 10:53.217
They want your dad back
as much as you do.

10:54.479 --> 10:57.178
But if you insist
to stay at school,

10:57.221 --> 10:59.571
then Agent Beecham is
gonna be there, too.

10:59.615 --> 11:02.313
Believe me, I don't
want to stay.

11:02.357 --> 11:05.534
I want to go be with my
brother and aunt in Maine.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.841
But that's not the way
my father raised me.

11:07.884 --> 11:11.540
You don't quit.
Life goes on.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.807
Life is gonna go on,
isn't it?

11:17.851 --> 11:19.200
We're gonna find your dad.

11:19.243 --> 11:22.029
I'm gonna find... your dad.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.508
But you saw the news.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.032
What have they done to him?

11:25.075 --> 11:26.468
Nothing that can't be undone.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.513
He is as tough as they come.BEECHAM:
Agent Gibbs.

11:28.557 --> 11:31.081
There's news.
The television.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.823
Please tell me it's not
another bank robbery.

11:33.867 --> 11:37.348
NEWSWOMAN:
This video was just uploaded
to an extremist website

11:37.392 --> 11:40.395
associated with wanted terrorist
Nigel Hakim.

11:40.438 --> 11:43.528
For years, brother Hakim
has been working in the shadows,

11:43.572 --> 11:46.401
fighting the American oppressors
in Afghanistan.

11:46.444 --> 11:49.143
Gibbs...He's alive.

11:49.186 --> 11:51.580
Alive, focus on that.

11:51.623 --> 11:55.976
You've been complacent,
fighting an endless war

11:56.019 --> 11:59.370
that has cost Afghans everything
and Americans nothing.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.764
But that is about to change.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.548
What the hell was that?

12:23.612 --> 12:26.136
Sitrep.
The explosion was
at a strip mall

12:26.180 --> 12:27.747
in Cherrywood, and there
was just another one

12:27.790 --> 12:29.444
outside Salt Lake City.How many?

12:29.487 --> 12:31.794
Well, in total,
12 dead, 50 injured.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.014
Torres just landed.
He came straight in.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.406
He's in touch with
first responders.

12:35.450 --> 12:36.538
Thanks.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.975
The primary targets
seem to be

12:39.019 --> 12:40.803
Navy recruitment centers.

12:40.847 --> 12:43.414
Southwest Field Office has
a team headed to Salt Lake.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.373
Bishop, MTAC.
Coordinate with Salt Lake.

12:45.416 --> 12:48.463
Torres, go meet McGee.
Maybe shower first.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.334
That bad?

12:50.378 --> 12:53.424
They're fumigating the lobby
as we speak.

12:53.468 --> 12:56.471
Hey, we're out of time, Gibbs.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.125
Which is why I need to speak
to Ambassador Rigg

12:58.168 --> 13:01.563
and see if she was able
to trace the bullion.

13:01.606 --> 13:04.479
Not a good idea.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.570
Yeah, so you told me.

13:08.613 --> 13:12.226
Hey, Gibbs...

13:13.531 --> 13:14.924
You think Hakim got to him?

13:14.968 --> 13:17.057
Got to him?

13:17.100 --> 13:18.754
You know, like Homeland.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.190
Homeland?

13:20.234 --> 13:21.975
Yeah, I mean, I'm saying
look at him.

13:23.454 --> 13:24.760
He looks like a zombie.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.067
He didn't even blink once.KASIE: Actually, he did.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.460
Five times, to be precise,
in a six-minute video.

13:29.504 --> 13:30.940
And if that wasn't
weird enough,

13:30.984 --> 13:33.638
you are gonna love--
Whoa, oh, what's that smell?

13:33.682 --> 13:34.770
It's called dedication.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.771
What am I gonna love?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.904
What just arrived at my lab.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.644
This is one
of the warning shots

13:39.688 --> 13:41.690
that Director Vance fired
during the robbery.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.953
He actually fired
three total.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.476
All three bull's-eyes.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.956
Now, that's no coincidence.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.871
So I'm thinking either the
director hates eyeballs...

13:50.177 --> 13:51.308
or...It's a message.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.136
Right, because
who hates eyeballs?

13:53.180 --> 13:55.486
And I am thinking
the message is,

13:55.530 --> 13:58.925
"Look into my eyes."

14:00.230 --> 14:03.451
I think he was giving us
a heads-up on the blinks.

14:03.494 --> 14:05.714
Take a look at which words
they happen over.

14:05.757 --> 14:08.760
The reality is that you are not
hated for your freedom...No blink.

14:08.804 --> 14:11.459
...but for your immoral
policies...No blink. No blink. No Blink.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.678
...which have created
an avalanche of...

14:13.722 --> 14:16.072
Blink on the word "avalanche."

14:16.116 --> 14:18.074
Then he does it again
here twice.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.555
And you've poisoned God's apple.Blink.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.905
Until you remove your troops
from our country,

14:22.949 --> 14:24.776
there will be no mercy
for your lifeless soul.

14:24.820 --> 14:27.605
Blink.
Over "apple" and "lifeless."

14:27.649 --> 14:28.998
Get to the point.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.695
Well, McGee says that Abby
usually kind of, like,

14:30.739 --> 14:32.610
winds up to it...I'm wound.

14:32.654 --> 14:37.528
Okay, uh, but here is
the full list.

14:37.572 --> 14:41.445
Avalanche, apple, lifeless,
karma, yearning.

14:41.489 --> 14:45.972
What does it mean?Oh, well...

14:46.015 --> 14:48.278
I thought you would know.

14:52.543 --> 14:55.068
NEWSMAN: Retail activity has
sputtered to a halt

14:55.111 --> 14:58.723
as authorities urge citizens
to avoid crowded areas.

14:58.767 --> 14:59.811
HAKIM:
As predicted,

14:59.855 --> 15:01.204
panicking like little children.

15:01.248 --> 15:02.205
Over what?

15:02.249 --> 15:03.641
You blew up two malls.

15:03.685 --> 15:06.035
Do you know how many malls
blow up every week

15:06.079 --> 15:08.298
where I come from?

15:08.342 --> 15:10.648
And no one in your country
even flinches.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.476
Your freedom
costs you nothing.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.565
Please, you're not a freedom
fighter, you're a psychopath.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.527
Enough!

15:20.528 --> 15:22.356
We are not animals, Hakim.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.314
Oh, really?

15:24.358 --> 15:26.490
He's done everything except
howl at the moon.

15:26.534 --> 15:29.580
He is angry.
And for good reason.

15:29.624 --> 15:32.453
But perhaps your leaders
will now understand

15:32.496 --> 15:36.500
the price for waging
endless war in my country,

15:36.544 --> 15:38.459
and withdraw its troops.

15:38.502 --> 15:43.159
The United States of America
will never submit to blackmail.

15:43.203 --> 15:46.119
Oh, I think it will.

15:46.162 --> 15:49.165
Especially after you give us
NCIS's security codes

15:49.209 --> 15:51.472
to the Bethesda Naval
Nuclear Test Station.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.953
There's something about
irradiated playgrounds

15:53.996 --> 15:55.998
that takes the fight
right out of people.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.913
You want to cause a meltdown?

15:59.741 --> 16:01.047
You can forget it.

16:01.090 --> 16:04.702
I went into that bank,
I read your statement.

16:04.746 --> 16:07.749
But you'll never get
those codes out of me.

16:08.706 --> 16:12.710
Need I remind you
what is at stake?

16:14.669 --> 16:16.540
And after I'm done with her,

16:16.584 --> 16:18.238
I'll find your son,

16:18.281 --> 16:21.197
wherever he's hiding.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.286
Well, good luck with that.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.593
You'll never get close
to my kids now.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.856
You missed the window, Chuck.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.727
That picture was taken
yesterday.

16:29.771 --> 16:33.731
Well, yesterday was
before my close-up.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.907
What did you do?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.216
What did you do?!

16:41.522 --> 16:42.740
Kill the girl.

16:47.745 --> 16:50.357
KAYLA: Really? You've never
heard of Taylor Swift?

16:50.400 --> 16:52.663
BEECHAM: Yeah, well, have you
ever heard of Cat Stevens?

16:52.707 --> 16:54.926
He actually goes by
Yusuf Islam now.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.406
Okay, bad example.
I'm just saying

16:56.450 --> 16:58.060
"The Sociology
of Taylor Swift"

16:58.104 --> 16:59.105
is not a real class.

16:59.148 --> 17:00.410
I mean, what do you
even study?

17:00.454 --> 17:02.369
The interplay
of gender and race

17:02.412 --> 17:04.110
using a pop-cultural icon

17:04.153 --> 17:05.894
to make a feminist critique
on modern media.

17:05.937 --> 17:07.809
Okay, yeah, that's
probably important.

17:07.852 --> 17:08.984
KAYLA:
Oh, really?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.052
Run!

17:49.372 --> 17:51.331
Gibbs.Oh, I got you.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.463
I got you, Kayla.

17:57.728 --> 17:58.729
How did you know?

18:04.605 --> 18:07.347
Your dad.

18:11.699 --> 18:14.658
I'm guessing they got
my message.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.921
I want those codes.
Mm.

18:16.965 --> 18:19.141
Maybe another time.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.757
You want to play games?

18:26.801 --> 18:29.847
Your children may be safe,
but how many others aren't?

18:29.891 --> 18:31.719
Their blood will be
on your hands.

18:31.762 --> 18:34.200
Those nuclear codes
would do you no good.

18:34.243 --> 18:35.766
The Pentagon would have
changed them by now.

18:35.810 --> 18:36.985
So give them to me.

18:42.382 --> 18:44.949
Hakim, Zaiyema would
like a word.

18:54.524 --> 18:58.615
You would do well to remember
what Zaiyema told you.

18:58.659 --> 19:02.010
The moment you are
useless to us,

19:02.053 --> 19:03.490
you're mine.

19:03.533 --> 19:06.406
So don't give us those codes.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.451
I would actually prefer it.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.282
Stay here, Jaah.

19:13.326 --> 19:18.026
If he opens his mouth,
make him bleed more.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.918
You need to drink something,
Director.

19:40.962 --> 19:44.618
I'm good, Jaah.

19:44.661 --> 19:47.011
My name isn't Jaah.

19:47.055 --> 19:49.057
It's Rickman.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.928
Nazy Rickman, CIA.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.845
Now, drink,
before he comes back.

20:00.068 --> 20:02.940
We have to figure out
how to get you out of here.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.725
The priority should be
stopping Hakim.

20:04.768 --> 20:06.422
Which you're gonna have
to do from the outside.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.946
If I blow my cover...It would jeopardize

20:08.990 --> 20:11.253
every other agent you've come
into contact with, understood.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.168
Okay, so what's the plan?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.126
I've been trying to get
a message to my handlers

20:15.170 --> 20:16.998
to let them know where you are.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.956
Can you get me a

20:19.000 --> 20:20.958
Won't do any good.

20:21.002 --> 20:23.526
He's got cell jammers
all over the compound.

20:23.570 --> 20:26.050
Hakim isn't taking
any chances with you.

20:26.094 --> 20:27.574
When he said you killed
his brothers,

20:27.617 --> 20:28.966
he wasn't being poetic.

20:29.010 --> 20:31.230
Those were his actual brothers.

20:31.273 --> 20:35.277
And Zaiyema is their mother?

20:36.670 --> 20:37.671
Lovely family.

20:37.714 --> 20:41.327
This... this is personal
for them.

20:41.370 --> 20:43.851
Well, for the record,

20:43.894 --> 20:45.983
it's personal for us, too.

20:47.681 --> 20:50.379
Agent Sloane. Did we
have an appointment?

20:50.423 --> 20:53.034
I'm so sorry to bother you
at home, I just, uh--

20:53.077 --> 20:54.992
Wow, what a gorgeous place.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.951
Uh, would you mind
if I took a load off?

20:56.994 --> 20:59.693
I am exhausted,
as I'm sure you are.

20:59.736 --> 21:02.826
But with everything
that's been going on,

21:02.870 --> 21:05.438
I just wanted
an update

21:05.481 --> 21:08.310
ASAP about your contact
from Interpol.

21:08.354 --> 21:10.181
Oh, right. But of course.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.661
Well, unfortunately,

21:11.705 --> 21:13.446
there's not
much to report.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.665
I put out a
Purple Notice

21:15.709 --> 21:17.667
on the gold bullion Hakim stole,

21:17.711 --> 21:20.366
and now, we...
well, we just have to wait.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.455
Not one of my better traits
when it comes to that guy.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.065
I have noticed.

21:24.108 --> 21:26.894
I would like to extend
my condolences on your agent.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.461
And I would also like

21:28.504 --> 21:30.289
to personally apologize
again to you.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.291
I am so sorry

21:32.334 --> 21:34.684
I didn't believe you
when you told me about Hakim.

21:34.728 --> 21:37.687
Oh, don't-- it's okay.
Honestly, I accept your apology.

21:37.731 --> 21:40.690
I have certainly made
a lot of mistakes myself.

21:40.734 --> 21:44.694
Starting with losing my cool
the night I saw him again.

21:44.738 --> 21:49.351
Yes, well, certainly,
no one blames you now.

21:49.395 --> 21:50.831
I blame me.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.833
I mean, I know better.

21:52.876 --> 21:55.096
Never tip your hand.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.707
Revenge 101.

21:57.751 --> 22:00.623
Revenge? I prefer justice.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.582
Sometimes they're
the same thing.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.061
In any case,

22:04.105 --> 22:06.499
if I had just waited for
the right time to make my move,

22:06.542 --> 22:09.197
it would've saved
a lot of people a lot of pain.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.503
Yes, well,

22:10.546 --> 22:13.636
hindsight is always 20/20.

22:13.680 --> 22:17.510
True. But the good news is,
I've learned my lesson

22:17.553 --> 22:19.599
and I won't make
that mistake again.

22:19.642 --> 22:22.950
So, is there anything else
I can help you with?

22:22.993 --> 22:25.605
Actually, there is.

22:25.648 --> 22:30.697
The FBI never mentioned what
Hakim stole from that bank vault

22:30.740 --> 22:33.134
in their draft report.

22:33.177 --> 22:36.964
So...

22:37.007 --> 22:40.315
how the hell did you know
it was gold bullion?

22:51.152 --> 22:54.198
Now, normally, I'd be thinking
you had a really bad day,

22:54.242 --> 22:56.244
but considering you were
trying to kill

22:56.287 --> 22:58.246
Director Vance's daughter,

22:58.289 --> 23:01.249
perhaps it's better that Gibbs
didn't capture you alive.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.120
Depends on what you got.
What do you got?

23:03.164 --> 23:06.863
Well, we already know
the cause of death: you.

23:06.907 --> 23:09.039
Ducky?I came down

23:09.083 --> 23:10.867
to give a hand in the autopsy

23:10.911 --> 23:12.913
of our
fallen comrade.

23:15.306 --> 23:16.786
Who is this guy?

23:16.830 --> 23:18.397
We don't know.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.442
I have been tearing
through this body,

23:20.486 --> 23:23.314
inside and out, quite literally,
trying to find something

23:23.358 --> 23:25.926
that will lead us closer
to Director Vance.

23:25.969 --> 23:30.017
His last meal could pinpoint
a particular restaurant, uh,

23:30.060 --> 23:32.498
dirt under the fingernails,
a certain area.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.325
Unfortunately...You have nothing.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.805
I can't even get ahold
of Agent Sloane

23:35.849 --> 23:37.894
to see if she recognizes him
from Afghanistan.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.548
Where is she?

23:39.592 --> 23:41.507
We got an ID on the shooter.
Kasie matched the prints.

23:41.550 --> 23:44.510
And the agents are escorting
Vance's son back from Maine.

23:44.553 --> 23:46.381
How long?

23:46.425 --> 23:48.601
Uh, he'll be in protective
custody within the hour.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.820
How is Kayla doing?McGEE:
Angry,

23:50.864 --> 23:53.214
scared and worried
there's more like him.

23:53.257 --> 23:55.259
His name is Rafi Paiz,
by the way.

23:55.303 --> 23:56.696
American.As apple pie.

23:56.739 --> 23:59.394
Grew up in Iowa, went to
college in Charlottesville,

23:59.438 --> 24:02.919
manages a custodial department
at a Virginia Tech firm,

24:02.963 --> 24:04.355
Glowbeam Technologies.

24:04.399 --> 24:06.183
I'm not getting an Afghan
freedom fighter vibe

24:06.227 --> 24:07.446
from this guy.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.448
McGEE: No.
Which makes you wonder how many

24:09.491 --> 24:11.798
other extremists Hakim has
hiding in their regular lives

24:11.841 --> 24:13.452
just waiting to be activated.

24:13.495 --> 24:15.105
OLIVIA:
At least one more.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.162
Tea, darling?

24:32.558 --> 24:34.081
What are you doing?

24:34.124 --> 24:35.822
Preparing to torture you.

24:35.865 --> 24:37.563
NEWSCASTER:
A ZNNbreaking news update.

24:37.606 --> 24:39.478
Authorities have confirmed...

24:39.521 --> 24:40.870
Not a moment too soon, it seems.

24:40.914 --> 24:43.133
You are violating

24:43.177 --> 24:45.701
every diplomatic immunity law
on the books.

24:45.745 --> 24:48.051
Then I'd better get
my money's worth.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.531
I don't know anything.

24:49.575 --> 24:54.580
You knew that Hakim stole
the gold bullion.

24:54.623 --> 24:56.582
And the only way
you could've known that

24:56.625 --> 24:58.061
is if you were working with him.

24:58.105 --> 24:59.889
Have you lost your mind?

24:59.933 --> 25:01.151
Probably.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.503
This looks good.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.505
So...

25:09.116 --> 25:12.380
Now, where are they holding
Director Vance?

25:12.423 --> 25:13.686
I-I must have overheard

25:13.729 --> 25:16.210
about the gold
from someone at your agency.

25:16.253 --> 25:17.603
One more time.

25:17.646 --> 25:19.996
Where's Director Vance?

25:20.040 --> 25:21.476
The State Department.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.610
The-the State Department,
they sent me an e-mail.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.002
Wrong answer!

25:26.046 --> 25:28.570
Stop. Please, stop.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.398
What's Hakim's next target?

25:30.441 --> 25:32.443
I don't know. You're making
a terrible mistake.

25:32.487 --> 25:34.576
You're not thinking clearly.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.186
Please, stop.

25:36.230 --> 25:40.495
Are you trying to find
your monster or become one?

25:43.672 --> 25:45.674
Where is it

25:45.718 --> 25:48.503
The e-mail from State.On my laptop.

26:03.518 --> 26:04.867
Oh, God.

26:04.911 --> 26:06.347
I'm so sorry.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.349
Please untie me.

26:08.392 --> 26:10.569
Of course.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.527
Oh, God,

26:12.571 --> 26:15.225
I don't... I don't know
what to say.

26:15.269 --> 26:19.316
The way you defended Hakim
when I first met you,

26:19.360 --> 26:21.667
and then you mentioned
the gold bullion theft, and...

26:21.710 --> 26:23.407
It's all right.

26:23.451 --> 26:24.539
You made a mistake.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.586
It's all right.No. Oh, my God.

26:27.629 --> 26:29.544
After what you've
been through, it...

26:29.588 --> 26:31.241
it happens.

26:32.808 --> 26:36.507
But as it turns out,

26:36.551 --> 26:40.381
your instincts
were spot-on.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.562
MAN: Salaam. Get me Hakim.

26:49.390 --> 26:50.826
We've got a problem.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.048
EMMA: Our Rafi,
working with terrorists?

26:55.091 --> 26:56.615
You got the wrong guy.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.442
We watched Beaches
in the office last week.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.749
Rafi couldn't stop crying.

27:02.403 --> 27:05.754
Whoa. Okay.
What can I do to help?

27:05.798 --> 27:07.974
You can tell us what Rafi did
for you guys,

27:08.017 --> 27:09.976
and, uh, what it is that you do.

27:10.019 --> 27:11.499
I'm still a little fuzzy on it.

27:11.542 --> 27:12.979
I explained it all in the car.

27:13.022 --> 27:16.373
No, you moved your mouth,
and all I heard was...

27:16.417 --> 27:18.245
EMMA:
It's simple.

27:18.288 --> 27:19.986
Glowbeam encrypts
Internet traffic.

27:20.029 --> 27:22.031
McGee, come on.
Was that so hard?

27:22.075 --> 27:23.903
And we're one
of the biggest.

27:23.946 --> 27:25.731
Dozens of Fortune 500 companies
are our clients,

27:25.774 --> 27:27.689
as well as several
state governments.

27:27.733 --> 27:28.908
So what was Rafi's job?

27:28.951 --> 27:31.040
You're looking at it.
He was a janitor.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.563
He kept our encryption
engine clean.

27:32.607 --> 27:35.697
What, you use lava lamps
as an encryption engine?

27:37.307 --> 27:39.266
No AES or key block ciphers?

27:39.309 --> 27:40.876
They're our
secret recipe.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.879
Good encryption requires
random numbers, right?

27:43.923 --> 27:45.707
But computers aren't
so good at being random.

27:45.751 --> 27:48.579
If you can help them,
you get better encryption.

27:48.623 --> 27:53.280
So you taped the random
movements of these lava lamps

27:53.323 --> 27:55.412
and you turned
that signal

27:55.456 --> 28:00.200
into random numbers
and then you, well,

28:00.243 --> 28:02.202
you do something with it.

28:02.245 --> 28:04.117
Encrypt the Internet, yes.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.509
Torres, I'm impressed.

28:05.553 --> 28:07.903
Oh, don't be.
Lava lamps and I go back.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.688
I was six years old.

28:09.731 --> 28:11.602
My parents had one
in their bedroom.

28:11.646 --> 28:14.649
I touched it, okay?
What kid wouldn't?

28:14.693 --> 28:15.868
But I burned
myself so bad

28:15.911 --> 28:17.739
that I missed the
Little League regionals.

28:17.783 --> 28:21.612
I, um,
I think that we should interview

28:21.656 --> 28:23.702
every employee that came
in contact with Rafi.

28:23.745 --> 28:24.964
Of course.

28:25.007 --> 28:27.009
I've been afraid to ask,
but do you think

28:27.053 --> 28:28.663
we're some sort of target?

28:28.707 --> 28:31.535
Well, there's no evidence
to suggest that.

28:31.579 --> 28:33.494
But let's not take
anything for granted.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.327
All right. Come on.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.565
Are you gonna hit me
in the face again?

29:01.609 --> 29:02.871
I said I was sorry.

29:06.396 --> 29:07.833
We don't have a lot of time.

29:07.876 --> 29:10.705
Hakim was called away
on something urgent,

29:10.749 --> 29:13.142
but I was able to get one
of his burner phones.

29:13.186 --> 29:15.797
Uh, t-there's no...
there's no signal.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.581
Jammer's still on. Wait here.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.105
I'm gonna try and reset it.

29:19.148 --> 29:20.889
You'll only have a small window
to make a call.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.369
I got a better idea.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.153
Give me a gun and point me
toward the exit.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.459
We'll never make it.

29:25.502 --> 29:28.810
That being said...

29:28.854 --> 29:30.333
if you don't get a signal

29:30.377 --> 29:32.335
in the next 60 seconds,
that means I was caught.

29:32.379 --> 29:34.685
You have another 30
before they come for you.Got it.

29:34.729 --> 29:37.036
Are you sure
you want to do this?No.

29:37.079 --> 29:39.081
Me, neither.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.348
Did you say lava lamps?

29:45.392 --> 29:46.785
That's what I heard.

29:46.828 --> 29:49.700
Uh, w-we know, but, uh,
apparently, it's a thing.

29:49.744 --> 29:51.267
HALSEY:
You think HakimYou can google it.

29:51.311 --> 29:53.792
is planning some kind of
cyberattack on the facility?

29:53.835 --> 29:56.185
Special Agents McGee and Torres
are looking into it.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.752
:
Well, mostly McGee.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.362
HALSEY: Well, we can't
let them hit us again.

29:59.406 --> 30:00.799
People are already panicking.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.322
I just got a report
of a stampede

30:02.365 --> 30:03.802
an hour ago
at the Mall of America.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.716
A car backfired.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.718
Yeah, well, that's gonna happen
if things keep blowing up.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.720
Yep. And Hakim knows it.

30:09.764 --> 30:11.810
How much longer do you need the
satellite recon, Agent Gibbs?

30:11.853 --> 30:14.638
We will let you know.What satellite recon?

30:16.858 --> 30:18.817
This is Gibbs. Who is this?

30:18.860 --> 30:19.818
I'll give you three guesses.

30:19.861 --> 30:20.993
:
Vance.

30:21.036 --> 30:22.646
Leon Vance.

30:22.690 --> 30:24.257
You are now on speaker.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.041
VANCE: You need to get ahold
of Vice Admiral Halsey.

30:26.085 --> 30:27.913
I'm here, Leon. Y

30:27.956 --> 30:29.610
VANCE:
Yeah, I'm okay for now.

30:29.653 --> 30:31.481
Please alert CIA I made contact
with one of their assets.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.614
Uh, Nazy Rickman.

30:33.657 --> 30:35.921
He's the one that smuggled me
this cell.Leon, where are you?

30:35.964 --> 30:37.879
Rickman says we're on
some kind of an estate

30:37.923 --> 30:40.490
neat an abandoned
toy factory in Largo.

30:40.534 --> 30:42.275
Bishop.Uh, on it.

30:42.318 --> 30:43.885
Hakim has been trying
to get my access codes

30:43.929 --> 30:45.539
to the Bethesda nuclear station.

30:45.582 --> 30:46.888
I presume that you've
changed them.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.847
We've changed
every code you had.

30:48.890 --> 30:50.109
But in the interest of caution,

30:50.152 --> 30:51.937
I propose we institute
Operation Lockdown.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.416
I concur.

30:53.460 --> 30:56.767
Leon. You hang in there.
We're gonna find you.

30:56.811 --> 30:59.945
Leon! Are you there?

30:59.988 --> 31:02.121
Yes? Can you...

31:03.165 --> 31:05.167
Oh...

31:09.955 --> 31:11.130
You get through?

31:11.173 --> 31:13.697
Yeah, but I ran out of quarters.

31:13.741 --> 31:15.699
Sorry. I had to turn
the jammers back on

31:15.743 --> 31:17.658
before anyone noticed.Don't worry.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.834
I was able to warn them
about the Bethesda reactor.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.097
They're instituting a
cybersecurity protocol

31:22.141 --> 31:24.883
that will completely block it
from all outside access.

31:24.926 --> 31:27.233
Yes. We heard.

31:28.669 --> 31:30.366
And it was much appreciated.

31:32.194 --> 31:34.805
Oh.

31:34.849 --> 31:38.331
This one actually
has a firing pin.

31:38.374 --> 31:40.333
HAKIM:
You see, Mr. Vance,

31:40.376 --> 31:42.117
I didn't actually need
those codes

31:42.161 --> 31:44.380
to hack your nuclear facility.

31:45.860 --> 31:50.169
I needed you to do
exactly what you just did.

32:01.745 --> 32:03.530
I just need two seconds
of your time

32:03.573 --> 32:04.574
to sign this form right here.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.098
Bishop, sitrep.

32:06.141 --> 32:07.664
Bethesda Nuclear's
on lockdown,

32:07.708 --> 32:09.275
and Torres is still interviewing
people at Glowbeam.

32:09.318 --> 32:10.711
And McGee is letting

32:10.754 --> 32:12.452
the CIA know that Vance
made contact with their agent.

32:12.495 --> 32:15.455
We get a location yet?No, and we have a problem.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.326
Agent Rickman told Vance
he was being held

32:17.370 --> 32:19.372
near an abandoned toy factory
in Largo.

32:19.415 --> 32:20.416
KASIE: Except there
are no abandoned

32:20.460 --> 32:21.896
toy factories
in Largo.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.767
Or any abandoned
factories at all.

32:23.811 --> 32:25.421
The entire area's
been gentrified,

32:25.465 --> 32:26.945
which really makes you
question the...Yeah, yeah, I got it.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.469
What's with the fan?Oh, the A/C isn't
working in my lab.

32:29.512 --> 32:31.427
Yeah, now that you mention it,
it is kind of warm in here.

32:31.471 --> 32:33.647
The compressor unit is
on the fritz and ever since

32:33.690 --> 32:36.389
that fake HVAC guy
infiltrated NCIS,

32:36.432 --> 32:38.260
Director Vance has
required his approval

32:38.304 --> 32:40.262
for all maintenance
requests.

32:40.306 --> 32:41.524
Hey, what fake
HVAC guy?

32:41.568 --> 32:44.832
I got to talk to CIA now.

32:44.875 --> 32:47.443
I just got off the phone
with them. We got a problem.

32:47.487 --> 32:48.879
They told me that
Agent Rickman

32:48.923 --> 32:51.012
was killed eight months ago
by Hakim's men.

32:51.056 --> 32:53.406
So who was the director
talking to?

32:53.449 --> 32:55.451
We're being played.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.497
Bishop, McGee,
let's go.

32:57.540 --> 32:59.629
EMERSON:
I understand your concern,

32:59.673 --> 33:02.893
Agent Gibbs, but, uh, as you can
see, our entire board is green.

33:02.937 --> 33:05.200
We'd like to keep it that way.

33:05.244 --> 33:08.290
Has there been a new threat
since Director Vance's warning?

33:08.334 --> 33:10.510
This is Agent McGee.

33:10.553 --> 33:12.033
Uh, well, we're worried
the warning itself

33:12.077 --> 33:13.295
was some kind
of trick.

33:13.339 --> 33:14.862
Even if it was, it's moot.

33:14.905 --> 33:16.342
We're completely locked down

33:16.385 --> 33:17.343
from outside
interference now.

33:17.386 --> 33:18.561
What about inside interference?

33:18.605 --> 33:20.346
Not an issue.
Not with my people.

33:20.389 --> 33:22.522
Boss, that was
Admiral Halsey's office.

33:22.565 --> 33:24.437
They said the Cuckoo's Nest
has landed.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.134
McGee, Bishop,
on my six.

33:29.616 --> 33:30.573
Open it.

33:30.617 --> 33:33.315
You get the funny feeling

33:33.359 --> 33:34.621
there's something
he's not telling us?

33:34.664 --> 33:36.144
Again, in MTAC,

33:36.188 --> 33:38.146
the vice admiral asked
about some satellite recon.

33:42.585 --> 33:43.543
That's odd.

33:43.586 --> 33:44.805
Nobody in the
building has

33:44.848 --> 33:46.546
the authority to override
my keycard.

33:46.589 --> 33:47.764
What about outside
the building?

33:47.808 --> 33:50.245
No, I told you,
we're totally locked down

33:50.289 --> 33:52.595
from outside interference.

33:52.639 --> 33:54.336
COMPUTER VOICE: Alert, alert.
Emergency procedures...

33:54.380 --> 33:55.946
You sure about that?

33:55.990 --> 33:57.644
HAKIM: Can you
appreciate the irony?

33:57.687 --> 34:00.995
Not only am I going to irradiate
half of Maryland and Virginia,

34:01.039 --> 34:02.736
but you're the man
who made it possible.

34:02.779 --> 34:05.869
So I'm guessing he's not
CIA Agent Rickman.

34:05.913 --> 34:07.175
Good guess.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.482
He's the man I hired
to create a Trojan horse

34:09.525 --> 34:12.006
to cause your nuclear research
facility to go critical.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.094
That was the easy part.

34:13.138 --> 34:14.661
But how to get it
into the plant?

34:14.704 --> 34:16.097
That was the rub.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.317
That is where you came in.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.927
I found a loophole,
but it required

34:19.970 --> 34:22.669
that the reactor
be placed on lockdown.

34:22.712 --> 34:25.541
You hid the Trojan horse
inside the lockdown codes.

34:25.585 --> 34:28.283
But the only group with
the power to activate them

34:28.327 --> 34:30.111
was the United States
federal government.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.113
Thank you
for the assist.

34:32.157 --> 34:35.073
I couldn't have done it
without you.

34:35.116 --> 34:36.378
Son of a...

34:36.422 --> 34:37.684
Oh, yes.Son of a...

34:37.727 --> 34:38.728
You feel that rage?

34:38.772 --> 34:40.774
It's almost liberating,
isn't it?

34:40.817 --> 34:42.950
You and I have a very
different view of liberty.

34:42.993 --> 34:45.692
Well, you're both going to have
a front row seat

34:45.735 --> 34:46.736
at my version of it.

34:50.044 --> 34:51.741
Jack.

34:53.439 --> 34:55.571
What did you do to her?HAKIM: Nothing yet.

34:55.615 --> 34:58.922
But it really is a treat
to have you both here.

34:58.966 --> 35:01.447
We're going to have so much fun.

35:02.926 --> 35:04.798
EMERSON: The cooling system
has been disabled.

35:04.841 --> 35:06.582
And you need
that, right?

35:06.626 --> 35:08.280
Yeah. If we don't
get it working soon,

35:08.323 --> 35:09.716
we're gonna have a meltdown.

35:09.759 --> 35:11.544
And I'm cut off
from our systems analyst.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.198
I don't do code.

35:13.241 --> 35:14.503
Well, McGee does. Come on.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.244
Come on, sit down.

35:16.288 --> 35:19.247
All right, accessing
command and control.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.729
Well, it looks like
there's a Trojan horse

35:22.772 --> 35:24.600
in the system. It's not even
trying to hide itself.

35:24.644 --> 35:27.864
Get rid of it.
Done.

35:27.908 --> 35:29.823
Oh, that was easy.

35:31.303 --> 35:32.695
Or not.

35:32.739 --> 35:35.263
A second one popped up.
Give me a moment.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.874
Got it.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.922
McGee.Boss, these keep coming.

35:41.965 --> 35:43.315
I-I don't know
where from exactly,

35:43.358 --> 35:44.925
but it's got to be
outside the facility.

35:44.968 --> 35:46.796
It can't be.
No, that's impossible.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.103
Operation Lockdown,
it doesn't just cut off access

35:49.147 --> 35:51.236
to our system,
it actively blocks it.

35:51.279 --> 35:52.541
How?

35:52.585 --> 35:54.717
The Pentagon, they send us
IP isolation codes

35:54.761 --> 35:56.023
a thousand times a second.

35:56.066 --> 35:57.416
Could the codes
have been hacked?

35:57.459 --> 35:59.548
No way. They come through
a third party vendor,

35:59.592 --> 36:01.159
encrypted with the
highest level of security.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.465
Wait, encrypted?
Yeah.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.946
Like... like lava lamps?

36:07.861 --> 36:10.080
Of course I touched it.
I mean, what kid wouldn't?

36:10.124 --> 36:11.691
I burned myself
so bad then.

36:11.734 --> 36:14.737
Excuse me.

36:14.781 --> 36:18.176
Yup, Special Agent Nick Torres,
bored out of his damn mind.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.743
You still at Glowbeam?Yeah, I just finished
my last interview.

36:20.787 --> 36:22.745
Where are you guys?BISHOP: In a nuclear power plant

36:22.789 --> 36:25.313
infected with a Trojan horse
that's about to go critical.

36:25.357 --> 36:28.229
Oh, we're having different days.Boss, they just keep popping up.

36:28.273 --> 36:29.970
I can't stop them.TORRES: Wait, are you serious?

36:30.013 --> 36:31.189
Bishop, you got to get
out of there.

36:31.232 --> 36:32.755
Where are you guys?
I'll be right there.

36:32.799 --> 36:34.061
No. Shut it down, Torres.

36:34.104 --> 36:35.715
Shut what down?BISHOP: Glowbeam. W-W-We think

36:35.758 --> 36:37.238
it's the source
of the virus.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.066
Oh, Hakim's guy, Mister Beaches.

36:39.109 --> 36:40.633
He must've hidden
the Trojan horse

36:40.676 --> 36:42.156
inside the encryption itself.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.766
You have to shut it down, now!

36:43.810 --> 36:45.594
We lose containment
in 20 seconds.

36:45.638 --> 36:47.161
Wait, shut down what?

36:47.205 --> 36:48.771
This-this place doesn't exactly
have an off button, Gibbs.

36:48.815 --> 36:50.860
Figure it out.

36:52.079 --> 36:52.993
15 seconds.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.651
Five seconds.

36:58.694 --> 37:02.002
This is for the regionals.

37:08.704 --> 37:10.663
Bishop, are you guys
still there?

37:11.925 --> 37:14.275
COMPUTER VOICE:
All clear. All clear.

37:14.319 --> 37:16.669
Reactor shutdown terminated.Yeah. Yeah.

37:16.712 --> 37:20.107
Good job, Nick.

37:20.150 --> 37:22.892
All right, now we're even.

37:22.936 --> 37:24.503
REPORTER:
Officials have confirmed

37:24.546 --> 37:26.548
a cyberattack has been
averted at the

37:26.592 --> 37:28.550
Bethesda Naval
Nuclear station.

37:28.594 --> 37:30.030
Well, that's a
bummer for you.

37:30.073 --> 37:32.685
We can report the reactor
has not been compromised.

37:35.383 --> 37:36.906
No.

37:38.778 --> 37:40.562
It's a bummer for you.

37:40.606 --> 37:42.085
We need to go
now, Hakim.

37:42.129 --> 37:43.652
I'm not going anywhere.

37:43.696 --> 37:45.306
Listen to your mother.

37:45.350 --> 37:46.873
You're going to watch me have
fun with your director.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.918
I'm going to cut
his fingers off.

37:48.962 --> 37:52.182
And when I'm done...: Sorry.

37:52.226 --> 37:54.881
I just thought of something
really funny.

37:54.924 --> 37:56.709
Go ahead. You were saying?

37:56.752 --> 37:59.189
And when I'm done,

37:59.233 --> 38:01.931
I'm going to cut his eyes out.Sorry.

38:01.975 --> 38:03.324
Totally
inappropriate.

38:03.368 --> 38:04.847
What is so funny?

38:04.891 --> 38:06.153
Are you sure you want to know?

38:06.196 --> 38:07.328
I sure as hell do.

38:07.372 --> 38:09.852
What's so funny is,
when I realized

38:09.896 --> 38:11.811
that Ambassador Rigg was dirty,

38:11.854 --> 38:14.727
I told Gibbs that I was
going to confront her.

38:14.770 --> 38:16.468
I hope he tried
to talk you out of it.

38:16.511 --> 38:17.556
He did.

38:17.599 --> 38:19.384
But he didn't stop you, did he?No.

38:19.427 --> 38:20.863
But what he did do

38:20.907 --> 38:23.692
was have me tracked
by a Navy recon satellite.

38:23.736 --> 38:26.782
I told him to call it
Operation Cuckoo's Nest,

38:26.826 --> 38:29.611
since the plan was to have Rigg
believe that I had lost my mind.

38:29.655 --> 38:32.788
You actually believed
that she got the drop on me,

38:32.832 --> 38:36.139
when really she just brought me
right back here to you.

38:36.183 --> 38:37.924
We need to go, Hakim, right now.

38:39.926 --> 38:42.798
Hakim!

38:42.842 --> 38:44.234
SOLDIER:
Go, go!

38:44.278 --> 38:45.801
SOLDIER:
Come on! Get down!

38:45.845 --> 38:47.629
GIBBS:
Drop it!

38:47.673 --> 38:48.674
Your call.

38:52.199 --> 38:53.766
Get your hands off me!

38:53.809 --> 38:54.941
Hakim!How you guys doing?

38:54.984 --> 38:56.508
I'll live.

39:02.296 --> 39:04.951
Hey, hey.

39:04.994 --> 39:06.213
You all right?

39:08.171 --> 39:11.566
Congratulations.

39:11.610 --> 39:13.176
You will finally
get your revenge.

39:13.220 --> 39:15.701
And now I will be the one
tortured in one

39:15.744 --> 39:17.877
of your black ops sites.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.183
And you call me the monster.

39:20.227 --> 39:23.796
Yeah, I got my revenge,

39:23.839 --> 39:25.841
but you aren't going
to a black ops site,

39:25.885 --> 39:27.887
and you aren't going
to be tortured.

39:27.930 --> 39:30.977
You are going to get
three meals a day,

39:31.020 --> 39:33.196
time to pray,
and the full weight

39:33.240 --> 39:34.502
of the United States government

39:34.546 --> 39:36.374
to protect you
during your trial.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.376
And you know why?

39:41.030 --> 39:44.425
You are the monster.

39:44.469 --> 39:46.427
We're the good guys.

39:58.134 --> 40:00.920
Lava lamps?
That's not real.

40:00.963 --> 40:02.312
Apparently,
you can google it.

40:02.356 --> 40:03.923
WOMAN:
Director!

40:03.966 --> 40:06.795
Hi. Hey, everybody. Thank you.

40:06.839 --> 40:09.798
Good to see you.Welcome back, Director.

40:09.842 --> 40:13.454
Oh, man. It's good to be back.

40:15.064 --> 40:16.414
Thanks.

40:16.457 --> 40:18.720
Happy to return the favor.

40:18.764 --> 40:20.069
Thanks for holding down
the fort.

40:20.113 --> 40:22.332
Dad!

40:22.376 --> 40:24.900
Kayla.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.818
It's okay.
It's okay.

40:29.862 --> 40:31.864
Aw.

40:31.907 --> 40:34.432
It's okay.

40:34.475 --> 40:36.651
You okay? It's okay.

40:36.695 --> 40:38.827
I heard everything.
I'm so proud of you.

40:38.871 --> 40:40.829
Oh, my goodness.

40:40.873 --> 40:43.745
Oh. Oh, I'm so proud of you.

40:43.789 --> 40:44.920
I'm so proud of you.
