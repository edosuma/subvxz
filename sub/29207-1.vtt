01:39.834 --> 01:43.302
Well, we rented out our rooms
for the night.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.531
He leaves on the weekends,

13:19.533 --> 13:22.500
probably to go back
to see his wife and kids.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.836
And that little white car
right there,

13:24.838 --> 13:27.205
this old woman named Margaret
lives there.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.107
She's from Vermont.

13:29.109 --> 13:32.477
So basically like
any car with shades on?

13:32.479 --> 13:34.379
Yeah, or else it'll steam up
from your breath,

13:34.381 --> 13:36.214
and cops look for steam.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.917
Where do you shower?

13:38.919 --> 13:41.452
Who says that I do?

13:41.454 --> 13:43.454
You smell like
Head & Shoulders.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.825
The YWCA.

13:46.827 --> 13:52.130
Do you like always let
strangers into your car?

13:52.132 --> 13:55.466
No, but when I read
your articles,

13:55.468 --> 13:58.970
I knew you were harmless.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.472
You stole my stuff?

14:01.474 --> 14:04.108
You threw it in the trash.

14:04.110 --> 14:07.045
I mean, what kind of guy
who writes about pet adoptions

14:07.047 --> 14:09.881
and county fairs
would hurt me?

14:09.883 --> 14:11.382
Besides, I need something to do

14:11.384 --> 14:13.451
while I'm sitting here
all night.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.856
Well, I guess it could make
good toilet paper.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.960
I don't have a toilet.

14:21.962 --> 14:26.097
There's some pretty good
stuff in here, like...

14:27.601 --> 14:29.334
Something about tortoises.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.502
Yeah, I know.
I wrote about tortoises.

14:31.504 --> 14:34.472
No, seriously. I mean...

14:34.474 --> 14:36.374
they've been adapting
to the deserts for eons,

14:36.376 --> 14:38.509
and then we just come through
with our strip malls

14:38.511 --> 14:42.547
and gas stations and just
pave right over their homes.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.449
It's so sad.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.951
Yeah, it is.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.953
That's why I wrote it.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.925
It's too bad nobody
gives a shit, I guess.

14:53.927 --> 14:57.195
I give a shit.
I give lots of shits.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.263
I mean...

14:58.265 --> 15:00.298
I know what you mean.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.336
Why are you here?

15:05.338 --> 15:09.574
I work for this company
called Slice.

15:09.576 --> 15:13.678
It's not working out
so well though, so...

15:13.680 --> 15:16.614
I think I'm just
probably gonna go home.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.117
That shitty clickbait company?

15:19.119 --> 15:20.251
Yep.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.586
Your stuff's better than that.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.454
Gee, thanks.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.559
Who's he?

15:28.561 --> 15:30.295
No one.

15:31.698 --> 15:35.500
I mean, he's like
everywhere on your car.

15:35.502 --> 15:38.303
Can you take the hint that
I don't wanna talk about it?

15:38.305 --> 15:41.205
Sorry. I was just
trying to be friendly.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.085
He's my dad, all right?

15:59.326 --> 16:01.559
Did they ever find him?

16:01.561 --> 16:04.295
No. Assumed dead
since I was nine.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.165
Then I got this
a few months ago.

16:14.174 --> 16:17.442
"Dear Fern,
your father needs your help.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.210
He's in Los Angeles.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.446
Sincerely, Dr. Green."

16:21.448 --> 16:22.747
Dr. Green?

16:22.749 --> 16:24.983
Some street guy.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.251
We searched the shelters
and databases,

16:27.253 --> 16:29.420
but can't find him.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.588
If you need to,
you can stay on our couch.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.023
We have surfers all the time.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.359
I don't surf on couches.

16:34.361 --> 16:38.262
- We have a shower and a toilet.
- I'm fine on my own.

16:38.264 --> 16:41.632
I don't what to say.
I just wanna...

16:41.634 --> 16:43.368
do something.

16:45.071 --> 16:46.637
Thanks, Wyatt.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.544
Hey, wake up.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.020
Oh, my God.

17:03.590 --> 17:06.524
Sorry. I guess
I overstayed my welcome.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.560
I deserve it for getting
drunk with a stranger.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.496
What about you?

17:11.498 --> 17:14.298
You just slept
in a weird girl's car.

17:14.300 --> 17:17.335
You should really think
about that, Wyatt.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.039
Okay.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.711
I'm kinda kidding.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.614
But kinda not.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.783
You wanna come inside?
I'll make you breakfast.

17:31.785 --> 17:34.452
I don't belong in your world.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.193
Well, maybe you should
give me your number

17:42.195 --> 17:44.128
- in case you need anything.
- I don't have a phone.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.596
Well, then maybe
I can find you one.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.832
I don't want it.
The Internet's terrifying.

17:47.834 --> 17:51.769
I've got laundry to do
and then I have work, so...

17:51.771 --> 17:53.371
- Work?
- Yeah.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.772
I work at the thrift store.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.841
Where do you think
I get all these cool rags?

17:58.278 --> 18:00.178
Well, it was nice talking.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.246
It was... decent.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.716
[engine starts]

18:25.105 --> 18:27.105
So did you have
a good time last night?

18:27.107 --> 18:28.739
Yeah, actually.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.441
I met a really
interesting girl.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.442
Oh, yeah?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.177
Yeah, the one in the hatchback.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.879
[gasps]

18:34.881 --> 18:36.614
I stayed in her car
that night too.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.884
- Oh, no, really?
- Yep.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.519
Dude, that's classic.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.654
It's almost as good
as the time that Barrett

18:43.656 --> 18:45.723
banged that chick
with one breast implant.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.159
Actually,
it's nothing like that.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.727
We just talked.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.696
- What?
- Yeah.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.232
I think I'm gonna help her
find her dad.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.766
Huh?

18:55.768 --> 18:57.602
I'm gonna write an article
about it for<i> Slice.</i>

18:57.604 --> 18:58.870
It might get some clicks.

18:58.872 --> 19:00.238
And she's into that?

19:00.240 --> 19:01.672
I'm gonna change her name.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.541
She's not probably
gonna read it, so...

19:03.543 --> 19:05.676
Sounds like you've
got it all figured out, man.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.313
Dude, nice wheelie,
by the way.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.581
Thanks.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.483
So Barrett really
slept with a girl

19:12.485 --> 19:14.452
who only has
one breast implant?

19:14.454 --> 19:15.653
Yeah.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.824
We called her Sili-con-solo.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.860
He would just put
the deflated breast to the side,

19:22.862 --> 19:25.496
and he would just
work up on the good one.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.598
You know the funny thing
about that story

19:27.600 --> 19:29.867
is that when she
finally got an implant

19:29.869 --> 19:31.903
put on the other side,

19:31.905 --> 19:34.505
she stopped
answering his calls.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.643
Well, that seems about right.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.945
After all, he really is
a one-breast caliber kinda--

19:43.383 --> 19:46.617
<i> ¶ Hey there,</i>

19:46.619 --> 19:48.452

19:48.454 --> 19:51.322
Would you happen
to know anybody

19:51.324 --> 19:52.823

I'm sorry.

20:43.977 --> 20:45.576
[inhales]

20:47.347 --> 20:48.846
You know, they're giving out
free meals

20:48.848 --> 20:50.548
down there at the church.

20:52.318 --> 20:55.519
You should get yourself one.

20:55.521 --> 20:58.356
I don't suppose you would
know anybody named Dr. Green.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.558
Let's see.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.728
Green, Green, Green, Green.

21:03.730 --> 21:06.597
Oh, you mean Dr. Gangrene.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.999
- Yeah, I know her.
- Her?

21:08.001 --> 21:09.800
Mm-hmm.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.503
She lives up under Sepulveda.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.771
She's a real doctor,
you know?

21:13.773 --> 21:15.940
Why do you call her
"Gangrene?"

21:15.942 --> 21:19.377
'Cause she's got gangrene
on her foot.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.879
Oh, well, then I guess she must
not be a very good doctor, huh?

21:21.881 --> 21:24.815
She amputated it herself.
She's real smart.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.751
Look, this--
this is really helpful.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.919
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.725
Just don't call her that
to her face, all right?

21:47.674 --> 21:48.739
I found her.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.508
You'll have to excuse me.

21:50.510 --> 21:54.812
I'm being hypnotized
by this machine.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.380
Far out.

21:56.382 --> 22:01.552
But on a cooler note,
Dr. Green, I found her.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.688
- Did you say her?
- Yeah.

22:03.690 --> 22:06.090
Didn't you do your laundry
last week?

22:06.092 --> 22:08.926
I'm always doing laundry.
Come on, let's go.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.796
Wait, what about your--
What about your clothes?

22:11.798 --> 22:13.731
I'll get 'em later.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.049
I guess this is it.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.852
I hope she's not
a bridge troll.

22:39.425 --> 22:42.526
<i> ¶¶ [soft guitar]</i>

22:50.970 --> 22:53.838

23:08.054 --> 23:11.455
Dr. Green, are you in there?

23:14.460 --> 23:15.993
Maybe she's not home.

23:18.631 --> 23:22.032
Hello, Dr. Green?
Dr. Gangrene?

23:22.034 --> 23:23.768
DR. GREEN:
Who is it? Who is it?

23:23.770 --> 23:27.138
Um, it's Wyatt, and--

23:28.741 --> 23:30.708
Who are you?
Transportation Authority, huh?

23:30.710 --> 23:31.909
No, no, we're not.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.544
Who told you
to call me Gangrene?

23:33.546 --> 23:35.146
It was your friend,
the old guy.

23:35.148 --> 23:36.580
I'm not friends
with an old guy.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.949
I am not going back
to that shelter.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.851
We're not taking you
back to a shelter.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.186
We're not going
to hurt you, please.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.821
I'm just looking for my dad--

23:43.823 --> 23:44.955
Simon.

23:44.957 --> 23:45.956
Yeah.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.658
I sent you the letter.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.628
Oh, my God.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.564
I'm Dr. Green.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.666
It's so nice to meet you.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.536
Likewise.

23:58.538 --> 24:01.439
- Can you let me friend go now?
- WYATT: Please?

24:01.441 --> 24:03.841
Sorry, kid.
I didn't mean it.

24:05.445 --> 24:07.778
Dr. Green.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.014
It's okay.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.516
Wyatt. Pleasure.

24:12.518 --> 24:15.052
Let me put this away.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.556
Sit! Sit, sit,
sit, sit, sit.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.124
It's dirty, it's filthy,
I know,

24:20.126 --> 24:22.460
but it's just I'm not
expecting any company.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.528
Just sit, sit, sit.
Come on.

24:32.705 --> 24:35.706
It's just a miracle
that you're here.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.541
Why did you send it?

24:37.543 --> 24:39.243
Oh, honey, he told me to.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.145
You know,
you're all he talks about.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.481
I think he thought
maybe it might be better

24:43.483 --> 24:46.750
if it came from some kind
of a neutral party, you know?

24:46.752 --> 24:48.252
See this?

24:48.254 --> 24:50.855
He built that for me.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.824
I met him under this bridge.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.595
He should have
sent it himself.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.763
Oh, honey, he's sick.

24:59.765 --> 25:02.533
He's always been sick.

25:02.535 --> 25:05.069
You see that behind you there?

25:05.071 --> 25:08.772
Now, he said
he carved that for me.

25:08.774 --> 25:11.175
But that's not my face, right?

25:11.177 --> 25:14.979
That's your face.
That's not me.

25:14.981 --> 25:18.516
He always used to carve
things like this.

25:18.518 --> 25:21.852
He's got cancer, Fern.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.721
What?

25:23.723 --> 25:25.990
Doesn't wanna go
to a hospital.

25:25.992 --> 25:28.192
He's gonna let it
finish him.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.194
That's why I wrote you
the note.

25:40.806 --> 25:43.807
When was the last time
you saw him?

25:43.809 --> 25:47.278
About two weeks ago,
I guess.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.280
There's a place called
Murphy's Ranch.

25:49.282 --> 25:51.315
It's one of his favorite spots.
It's up in Topanga.

25:51.317 --> 25:55.719
Were you two at all...

25:55.721 --> 25:58.656
Yes, we were.

25:58.658 --> 26:02.927
He's a hard man
to hang onto.

26:02.929 --> 26:05.930
Maybe I was better off
without him.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.932
Now, if you believe that,

26:07.934 --> 26:09.700
you wouldn't have
gotten in your car,

26:09.702 --> 26:11.802
come all the way down here,
now, would you, huh?

26:16.809 --> 26:19.944
You have to see your father.
He should see you again.

26:19.946 --> 26:22.947
He should see what a lovely
young lady you've become.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.185
It was nice meeting you,
Dr. Green.

26:28.187 --> 26:30.988
No, you don't have to go yet.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.090
We can't waste any more time.

26:33.092 --> 26:36.860
Well, listen, kids,
if you need anything,

26:36.862 --> 26:39.229
you need anything at all...

26:40.900 --> 26:42.933
Oh, I can't believe
you're here.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.202
I just can't believe it.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.971
If you need anything,
you call me.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.139
You come right here.
You come right here.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.774
- Thanks.
- You have any questions--

26:50.776 --> 26:52.209
We will. Thanks.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.712
- You know where to find me.
- Okay.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.183
WYATT: Hey.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.786
Do you really have a PhD?

27:02.788 --> 27:06.757
Berkeley '71,
Philosophy.

27:06.759 --> 27:09.927
You be careful of her.
She's like her papa.

27:43.796 --> 27:47.698
<i> ¶¶ [guitar]</i>

28:05.151 --> 28:07.217
Gotta say,
your dad has great taste

28:07.219 --> 28:09.987
in getaway locations.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.989
He must love it here.

28:11.991 --> 28:17.127
Was he, um, decent
when he was around?

28:17.129 --> 28:20.064
Yeah, from what I remember.

28:20.066 --> 28:23.367
I mean, sometimes
I'd look into his eyes,

28:23.369 --> 28:25.736
and he just wasn't there.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.106
My grandparents said
the last time they saw him,

28:29.108 --> 28:33.777
he was slow dancing with a
Barbie doll in the living room.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.480
Well, maybe
they ran away together

28:36.482 --> 28:39.016
and started a family.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.884
That'd be nice.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.994
WYATT: Are you scared?

28:52.465 --> 28:54.998
I'm always scared.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.278
Anybody home?

29:10.483 --> 29:12.750
Hey, look at this.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.187
Hello?

29:17.189 --> 29:19.089
Think I could fit in here?

29:19.091 --> 29:20.424
No, don't do that, Fern.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.926
- I think so.
- Fern, seriously?

29:22.928 --> 29:24.328
- Yeah.
- Fern!

29:29.435 --> 29:31.201
Whoa.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.871
It's so cool in here.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.973
Hey, you should come in here.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.842
Nah, I'm not really
a derelict-structure kinda guy.

29:43.082 --> 29:44.915
He's here!

29:44.917 --> 29:47.151
He's-- He's in there?

29:48.954 --> 29:50.487
- Garbage?
- No.

29:50.489 --> 29:53.190
Sardines.
They were his favorite.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.994
Those could be anybody's.
You know that, right?

29:56.996 --> 29:59.429
No, it's his brand:
Beach Cliff.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.265
He's here.
He's definitely here.

30:01.267 --> 30:02.833
Come on,
we have to go find him.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.201
- Okay.
- Come on!

30:04.203 --> 30:07.070
Your dad has
a brand of sardines?

30:24.056 --> 30:25.455
Hello?

30:28.160 --> 30:29.426
Hey, look.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.161
This is his.

30:33.299 --> 30:35.299
And this is his stuff.

30:38.204 --> 30:39.603
What's this?

30:42.441 --> 30:46.109
It's a medical bracelet with
his name on it. Lynn Blade.

30:46.111 --> 30:48.278
Wait, I've read about
that place.

30:48.280 --> 30:51.048
It's a psych ward downtown.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.851
What is this place?
[pounding]

30:53.853 --> 30:56.420
Why can't we get in?
Maybe he's here.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.188
Goddamn it!

31:16.008 --> 31:18.175
I just want him to be real.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.444
I promise he's real.

31:35.427 --> 31:38.495
What just happened?
Is this a joke?

31:38.497 --> 31:41.565
Wyatt, Wyatt.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.367
Are you okay? Wyatt!

31:43.369 --> 31:46.270
- [snoring]
- Huh?

31:53.279 --> 31:55.145
This is embarrassing.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.519
What the fuck was that?

32:03.923 --> 32:05.322
I fell asleep.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.091
Wow.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.459
That boring, huh?

32:09.461 --> 32:11.061
Narcolepsy.

32:11.063 --> 32:13.563
Seriously?
Why didn't you tell me?

32:13.565 --> 32:15.098
You just scared the crap
out of me.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.700
I thought I had a handle on it.

32:16.702 --> 32:18.368
Jesus.

32:18.370 --> 32:21.438
It only happens when I get
emotionally triggered.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.707
How do you drive?

32:23.709 --> 32:25.976
I don't know.
I try to stay calm,

32:25.978 --> 32:28.946
listen to smooth jazz,

32:28.948 --> 32:30.714
avoid road rage.

32:32.518 --> 32:35.485
You know, when I was a kid
in like school,

32:35.487 --> 32:38.422
all the students would just try
to get me so riled up and angry

32:38.424 --> 32:41.258
so I'd pass out and wake up

32:41.260 --> 32:45.162
with a bunch of
marker drawings on my face.

32:45.164 --> 32:48.732
- Aw, that's so terrible.
- I know.

32:48.734 --> 32:52.035
Wait, does this mean
that you're gonna fall asleep

32:52.037 --> 32:54.004
every time we kiss?

32:54.006 --> 32:56.206
I guess we'll just
have to find out.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.747
- You look alert.
- Yeah?

33:03.749 --> 33:05.449
[shouting]

33:05.451 --> 33:06.984
Jesus!

33:10.556 --> 33:12.522
Sorry. I thought
you were park rangers.

33:12.524 --> 33:14.157
We didn't see anything.
We're not gonna tell anybody.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.525
What do you think I'm doing?

33:15.527 --> 33:18.161
Do you think
I'm making meth in there?

33:18.163 --> 33:21.765
Goddamn it! I'm tired of
people thinking that

33:21.767 --> 33:23.533
just 'cause of the way I look!

33:23.535 --> 33:27.471
What about me says
I'm making meth?

33:29.508 --> 33:31.208
It's not what I'm making!

33:31.210 --> 33:33.477
What are you making then?

33:33.479 --> 33:36.613
Making angel dust, PCP.
It's not meth.

33:36.615 --> 33:39.149
That's gross, you know?

33:39.151 --> 33:42.019
It's not a big deal.
Gotta make something.

33:42.021 --> 33:44.321
It's hard to get a job
out there for a felon.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.722
We understand.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.324
Yeah, no, we're not
judging you at all.

33:48.627 --> 33:51.361
Thank you.
Actually, that...

33:51.363 --> 33:53.497
You actually don't even know
how much that means.

33:53.499 --> 33:55.098
I need to hear that sometimes.

33:55.100 --> 33:56.199
WYATT: You're welcome.

33:56.201 --> 33:59.136
Do you wanna buy some?

33:59.138 --> 34:02.072
Do you know a guy named Simon
who lives out here sometimes?

34:02.074 --> 34:03.540
Yeah, I know him.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.242
Haven't seen him
in a few weeks though.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.744
If you see him,
that bastard owes me money.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.546
This homeless powder
isn't free.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.314
He does PCP?

34:11.316 --> 34:12.349
[chuckles]

34:12.351 --> 34:14.718
He dabbles.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.753
You should try
the Star Hotel downtown.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.655
He's usually there
with the other degenerates.

34:18.657 --> 34:19.823
Thanks.

34:19.825 --> 34:22.659
Hey...

34:22.661 --> 34:25.095
you're not gonna tell anyone
about me, are you?

34:25.097 --> 34:28.598
We have no idea where we are,
so that would be impossible.

34:28.600 --> 34:32.135
I trust you guys to keep my
clandestine drug lab a secret.

34:32.137 --> 34:33.303
Really?

34:33.305 --> 34:34.571
No.

34:36.575 --> 34:39.242
Hey, wait!
I was kidding!

34:39.244 --> 34:41.778
I was just--
It's lonely out here, man!

ever work?

By the way,
rent's due tomorrow.

34:59.665 --> 35:01.665
Oh, dude, I didn't tell you.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.200
- What?
- My uncle died.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.434
Barrett, um...

35:06.171 --> 35:07.737
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say. I--

35:07.739 --> 35:08.805
No, it's great, man!

35:08.807 --> 35:11.174
I inherited 20K, man!

35:11.176 --> 35:12.742
That's $20,000!

35:12.744 --> 35:14.511
So I was planning,
not next week,

35:14.513 --> 35:16.379
but the week after
to do like a work search

35:16.381 --> 35:17.747
and try to find a job.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.883
Not happening now, dude!

35:19.885 --> 35:22.519
Well, in at case,
I guess congratulations.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.287
¶ My uncle's gone ¶

35:24.289 --> 35:26.823
¶ He's in the sky ¶

35:26.825 --> 35:30.894
¶ I got the cash,
and I am fine ¶

35:30.896 --> 35:32.429
Nice to meet you, sir.

35:32.431 --> 35:33.563
Hey.

35:33.565 --> 35:36.433
Don't say "sir."
Say "bro."

35:36.435 --> 35:37.634
You haven't met Farid yet.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.136
No, I have not.

35:39.138 --> 35:40.804
Yeah, he just got in
from Delhi.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.739
He's one of my employees
over there.

35:42.741 --> 35:46.476
Nice to meet you, bro.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.547
Ooh, you gotta let
those cool down, dude.

35:50.549 --> 35:51.882
They are very hot.

35:51.884 --> 35:54.317
So anyway, uh...

35:54.319 --> 35:57.554
kinda have Fern coming over.

35:57.556 --> 35:59.356
Cool.
The homeless chick, right?

35:59.358 --> 36:01.825
Let's not call her that
ever again,

36:01.827 --> 36:03.560
if you don't mind.

36:03.562 --> 36:04.895
And if it's at all possible
for you guys

36:04.897 --> 36:08.632
maybe to like,
I don't know, clear out?

36:08.634 --> 36:09.833
[knocking]

36:09.835 --> 36:11.902
Or not.

36:11.904 --> 36:14.704

Come in!

36:16.775 --> 36:18.175
[door closes]

36:20.579 --> 36:22.646
Guys, this is Fern.

36:24.550 --> 36:25.582
Hi.

36:29.955 --> 36:32.589
Hi. These are my roommates.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.691
I'm Barrett.
How do you do?

36:34.693 --> 36:36.593
It's nice to finally meet you.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.361
Hello.

36:38.363 --> 36:39.829
We've heard so much about you.

36:39.831 --> 36:42.699
So you know
why I'm here then.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.734
I think you're going
to dinner, right?

36:47.472 --> 36:51.575
To save your souls
from the coming apocalypse.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.844
What?

36:54.846 --> 36:57.948
The government's
watching us right now.

36:57.950 --> 37:00.617
CIA, NSA, FBI,

37:00.619 --> 37:03.286
Homeland Security.

37:03.288 --> 37:04.854
Everybody knows that.
It was on<i> 60 Minutes.</i>

37:04.856 --> 37:06.489
No, seriously.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.993
They've got
this whole place bugged.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.434
They're all working together
to orchestrate this one.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.669
The end of humanity.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.671
We must go underground!

37:21.673 --> 37:23.907
They're listening to us
right now, I promise.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.875
We have to fight back.

37:25.877 --> 37:26.977
Really, bro?

37:26.979 --> 37:28.278
Really, bro!

37:28.280 --> 37:30.247
We have to fight
the bastards.

37:32.451 --> 37:33.883
You have to help yourself.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.852
You know the truth.
I can see it in your eyes!

37:35.854 --> 37:38.421
- I don't.
- Fern, let's just get going.

37:38.423 --> 37:39.856
We have a reservation.

37:39.858 --> 37:42.692
Just calm down.
Just look at me.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.995
Look at me, Fern. Listen to me.
Fern, can you hear me?

37:44.997 --> 37:47.564
Fern, Fern, look at me, please.
Look at me, Fern!

37:47.566 --> 37:49.799
Can you hear me?
Fern, are you there?

37:52.471 --> 37:54.638
Oh, my God, that's--

37:54.640 --> 37:57.440
- [laughing]
- You are--

37:57.442 --> 37:59.776
You're certifiably insane.

37:59.778 --> 38:02.912
Come on, let's go to dinner.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.883
I gotta say,

38:06.885 --> 38:09.286
your level of commitment
is really commendable.

38:09.288 --> 38:12.889
Guess I'm just not great
with first impressions.

38:12.891 --> 38:15.525
You know, they're never
gonna let you come back.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.494
That was my intention.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.663
[laughing]

38:24.403 --> 38:26.569
I'm sorry I couldn't take you
to a real restaurant.

38:26.571 --> 38:28.505
Don't worry about it.
I live off of this stuff.

38:28.507 --> 38:31.007
I know what time
every fast-food breakfast ends.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.575
That's an admirable quality.

38:32.577 --> 38:35.078
Seriously, try me.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.846
Um, Burger King.

38:36.848 --> 38:37.981
12:00.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.317
- Taco Bell.
- 11:00.

38:40.319 --> 38:41.484
- Arby's.
- Yuck.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.420
I'd rather skip breakfast.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.755
I thought vegetarians
were like huge foodies.

38:45.757 --> 38:48.758
I can't afford to be a foodie.
[chuckles]

38:48.760 --> 38:50.727
Of course.

38:50.729 --> 38:54.064
- I live in my car...
- Mm-hmm.

38:54.066 --> 38:56.066
I eat french fries.

38:56.068 --> 38:59.102
I guess you do make a point.

39:03.975 --> 39:07.510
And seriously though,
that girl's mental.

39:07.512 --> 39:10.080
Honestly, it probably was
the best date I've ever gone on.

39:10.082 --> 39:12.582
Date?

39:12.584 --> 39:14.484
Chill with a girl.

39:14.486 --> 39:17.387
Either way, it was amazing.

39:17.389 --> 39:20.824
Whoa, dude.
Where'd you learn that?

39:20.826 --> 39:22.359
Saw it online.

39:22.361 --> 39:23.827
- So guess what.
- What?

39:23.829 --> 39:25.495
I finished the article,

39:25.497 --> 39:27.097
and<i> Slice</i> is gonna
put it on the website.

39:27.099 --> 39:29.466
No shit!
Hey, congrats, dude.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.634
Yeah, it's a good thing
we got going.

39:31.636 --> 39:35.438
For you and her,
or you and the job?

39:35.440 --> 39:37.774
Both?

39:40.979 --> 39:43.513
Hey, I think our form
is looking pretty good.

39:43.515 --> 39:44.647
Yeah?

39:44.649 --> 39:46.149
I think we're ready.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.451
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's do it.

39:48.453 --> 39:52.655
So what happens
after she finds daddio?

39:54.559 --> 39:56.926
I don't know.
I'll just play it by ear.

39:57.929 --> 39:58.962
- Shit!
- No.

39:58.964 --> 40:00.130
Whew!

40:03.502 --> 40:05.502

I think we need wetsuits.

42:03.655 --> 42:06.089

to look like a horror film.

42:56.141 --> 43:00.877
It's weird seeing it written out
officially like this.

They used electric shock.

Geez, they still do that?

- I don't know. This way.

Aah!

43:32.377 --> 43:34.243
Sorry.

Ow. Okay.
I'm gonna wrap it up.

45:41.005 --> 45:43.940
you met that homeless chick,

45:43.942 --> 45:45.975
you've put us
on the back burner.

maybe tell me

46:04.829 --> 46:07.130
what the fuck
is going on right now?

46:08.500 --> 46:10.500
I've done some research
on Fern.

46:10.502 --> 46:12.835
What? Why?

46:12.837 --> 46:15.505
She's not who she says she is.
She's making it all up.

46:15.507 --> 46:17.507

46:20.512 --> 46:22.078

She's a charlatan, dude.

46:25.250 --> 46:27.083
Yeah, she's like a gypsy.

been trying to find,

46:33.191 --> 46:34.323
it can't be her dad, okay?

47:19.370 --> 47:21.270
Oh, it's $3.

47:21.272 --> 47:24.106
It has a great big dent in it.
See right there?

47:24.108 --> 47:26.542
Yeah, that's why it's $3.

47:26.544 --> 47:29.278
How about $2?

47:29.280 --> 47:32.048
I'm sorry.
It's already only $3.

I come in here all the time.

47:34.919 --> 47:37.453
All the proceeds
go to charity, so...

47:37.455 --> 47:41.157

suck so bad?

47:41.159 --> 47:44.427
Right, well, um, it's $3.

like to buy it. Thanks.

Just take the dang toaster,
lady, okay?

48:12.891 --> 48:15.892
No! I don't want it anymore!

48:18.630 --> 48:22.365

to this stupid store again!

remember?

Oh, no, I remember
I totally fell for the bait.

I'm sorry.

It's not your fault.

50:59.524 --> 51:01.223
She liked pills.

51:03.294 --> 51:06.262
The hatchback was hers.

51:06.264 --> 51:10.266
I used to sleep in it at night
in my godparents' driveway.

51:12.136 --> 51:14.437
It still had her scent
back then.

51:17.742 --> 51:20.209
Are you married?

Legally, yeah,

I never really loved him much.

51:28.619 --> 51:31.554
Do you think he's out there
looking for you?

51:31.556 --> 51:36.425
No. When I got Green's letter,
I saw it as my chance to leave.

51:39.130 --> 51:41.664
Tomorrow we'll go talk
to Dr. Green.

51:43.501 --> 51:45.367

the green flash tonight.

52:04.555 --> 52:05.855
What's that?

52:08.226 --> 52:10.593

when the sun goes down,

52:10.595 --> 52:13.195
right before it disappears.

52:13.197 --> 52:18.701
It's really rare,
but I've seen it happen once.

52:18.703 --> 52:20.703
It's supposed to mean
good luck.

52:32.917 --> 52:36.552
It only really happens
in pollution anyway.

what happened to you two.

I'm so sorry.

53:37.882 --> 53:39.915
This is him.

53:40.918 --> 53:42.918
This is all him.

53:44.989 --> 53:47.523
He's all here.

53:50.995 --> 53:52.962
That's mine.

53:52.964 --> 53:55.297
That should never
have been in there.

54:11.549 --> 54:14.350
Why didn't you show me
these things earlier?

54:14.352 --> 54:15.651
He just dropped it by.

54:15.653 --> 54:17.653
Didn't even bother
to wake me up.

54:17.655 --> 54:19.288
He must know you're in town.

54:19.290 --> 54:21.257
Where is he going?

54:21.259 --> 54:23.892
If you didn't find him
at Murphy's Ranch...

54:23.894 --> 54:26.695
Shady Acres.
He's gonna be at Shady Acres.

54:26.697 --> 54:27.997
A rehab?

54:27.999 --> 54:30.466
No, no, no, no, no!

54:30.468 --> 54:32.268
It's a refuge.

54:32.270 --> 54:34.603
To get off the drugs
you got him on?

54:34.605 --> 54:37.706
I didn't get your dad on drugs.

54:37.708 --> 54:39.475
I might do a little
smokey-smoke, kiddo,

54:39.477 --> 54:42.945
but your old man,
he likes to self-medicate,

54:42.947 --> 54:44.947
and there's nothin'
he won't take.

54:47.285 --> 54:49.985
You don't mind me asking,

54:49.987 --> 54:52.354
why do they call you Gangrene?

54:58.796 --> 55:03.666
This is what happens
when you cut your foot,

55:03.668 --> 55:09.004
and you don't get it
taken care of in time.

55:09.006 --> 55:10.339
What do you think?

55:10.341 --> 55:12.875
Is that making you happy?

55:12.877 --> 55:15.511
Your father carved that.

55:15.513 --> 55:18.747
He did such a good job,
nobody knows I even have it.

55:18.749 --> 55:20.916
I can walk a couple of feet,
you don't even tell.

55:20.918 --> 55:24.386
You don't have to cut
your toenails anymore.

55:24.388 --> 55:28.357
No, but the termites,
my dear, are a bitch.

55:35.933 --> 55:38.767
So do you know what you're gonna
say to him when you see him?

55:38.769 --> 55:40.502
Not at all.

55:42.606 --> 55:45.007
How 'bout we practice?

55:45.009 --> 55:47.676
I'll be Simon,
and you can be you.

55:47.678 --> 55:49.078
Okay.

55:51.782 --> 55:53.849
[Southern accent]
Hiya, Fern.

55:53.851 --> 55:56.685
Hey, Dad. Didn't know
you were a Southerner now.

55:56.687 --> 55:58.887
Do you remember me?

55:58.889 --> 56:02.024
I spent some time
in the Ozarks.

56:02.026 --> 56:03.592
Oh.

56:03.594 --> 56:06.095
I did a lotta thinkin'
back there.

56:06.097 --> 56:09.431
I... I thought about you.

56:12.937 --> 56:16.672
I understand if you
don't wanna forgive me.

56:16.674 --> 56:18.941
Yeah, I know, I get it.

56:18.943 --> 56:22.578
You're a pretty
messed-up dude.

56:22.580 --> 56:25.848
Guess I can't blame you
for being the way you are.

56:25.850 --> 56:27.649
Maybe I'm the same way.

56:27.651 --> 56:30.085
You think you're the sa--
I mean...

56:30.087 --> 56:33.622
You think
we're the same way?

56:33.624 --> 56:36.458
Guess we'll see.

56:36.460 --> 56:39.561
Mental illness
comes out in your 20s.

56:39.563 --> 56:41.997
Did for you, right, Pops?

56:50.474 --> 56:52.408
That's my girl.

56:56.147 --> 56:59.481
[phone chiming]

57:03.821 --> 57:05.120
Um, hello?

57:05.122 --> 57:06.855
<i> SEAN: Wyatt, my man.</i>

57:06.857 --> 57:09.558
Yeah, Mom, do you mind
if I just call you back later?

57:09.560 --> 57:12.728
Yeah, I'll talk to you soon,
okay? Love you too. Bye.

57:14.031 --> 57:16.031
Why is your mom calling
right now?

57:16.033 --> 57:20.002
Um, she's just, uh...
She's just emotional.

57:20.004 --> 57:22.538
She really wanted me
to move back.

57:22.540 --> 57:24.039
Are you going to?

57:24.041 --> 57:26.041
No.

57:26.043 --> 57:30.112
Why would I...
I mean, are you...

57:30.114 --> 57:32.748
Where are you
gonna go anyway,

57:32.750 --> 57:35.584
after we figure this all out?

57:35.586 --> 57:37.119
Hey, guys, come down.

57:37.121 --> 57:39.721
I got some drinks
with your names on 'em.

57:39.723 --> 57:41.690
Come on, let's go.

57:42.827 --> 57:45.027
- Shall we?
- Yep.

57:47.565 --> 57:49.798
[laughing]

57:49.800 --> 57:53.735
- It was Barrett's girlfriend?
- Yes!

57:53.737 --> 57:56.839
In India, we don't even talk
to a girl before we're married.

57:56.841 --> 57:59.475
It is ridiculous!

57:59.477 --> 58:02.144
Hey, we need shots.

58:02.146 --> 58:03.479
Really?

58:03.481 --> 58:04.680
No more shots.

58:04.682 --> 58:07.950
More shots, more shots,
more shots!

58:07.952 --> 58:10.018
- More shots?
- More!

58:10.020 --> 58:11.520
- More.
- No!

58:11.522 --> 58:13.021
Yes.

58:13.023 --> 58:15.657
Here, you get the big one,
big guy.

58:15.659 --> 58:16.859
- Great.
- He's my bestie best.

58:16.861 --> 58:18.193
Here you go.

58:18.195 --> 58:19.795
- Thanks, bestie.
- Here you go, man.

58:19.797 --> 58:22.898
And okay, we're gonna toast.

58:22.900 --> 58:25.167
To friendships.

58:28.272 --> 58:32.007
[coughing]

58:32.009 --> 58:33.108
No more.

58:33.110 --> 58:35.677
Yeah, hits the spot.

58:35.679 --> 58:38.247
- I can't--
- [phone chiming]

58:41.552 --> 58:46.121
Um, hey, guys,
I gotta go make a phone call.

58:46.123 --> 58:47.556
No!

58:47.558 --> 58:48.657
Yeah, no, don't worry.

58:48.659 --> 58:50.726
I'll be back. I'll just...

58:50.728 --> 58:52.261
FARID: Don't go.

58:52.263 --> 58:54.296
- This is our time, man!
- What a mama's boy.

58:54.298 --> 58:56.832
- Don't go on without me, okay?
- Okay.

58:56.834 --> 58:58.967
What a fuddy-duddy.

59:00.804 --> 59:03.539
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

59:05.776 --> 59:09.211
MAHONEY: Hey, that's not--
that's not the couch.

59:09.213 --> 59:11.079
<i> SEAN: Keep suckin'</i>
<i> on these teats, Wyatt.</i>

59:11.081 --> 59:12.981
<i> You're makin' mama proud.</i>

59:12.983 --> 59:16.218
About that,
I was trying to cover.

59:16.220 --> 59:18.220
<i> Oh, you can call me Mom.</i>
<i> That's cool.</i>

59:18.222 --> 59:23.258
You know, your story's
really interesting, by the way.

59:23.260 --> 59:25.294
Thanks.

59:25.296 --> 59:27.162
My mom left
when I was little too.

59:27.164 --> 59:29.264
Wyatt told you about my--

59:29.266 --> 59:31.066
Was I not supposed to know?

59:32.970 --> 59:34.670
<i> We need it by next week.</i>

59:34.672 --> 59:37.339
No problem, I just...

59:37.341 --> 59:40.208
I don't know. I think
I should tell her, honestly.

59:40.210 --> 59:41.910
<i> Think about</i>
<i> what's important, okay?</i>

59:41.912 --> 59:43.679
<i> Your career or this girl?</i>

59:43.681 --> 59:45.614
I know, I know.

59:49.720 --> 59:52.321
Ooh, okay.

59:52.323 --> 59:55.891
You know, it's pretty insane
that you live in that car.

59:55.893 --> 59:58.093
Why do you say that?

59:58.095 --> 1:00:00.329
I mean, you're
way too attractive for that.

1:00:00.331 --> 1:00:02.664
Um...

1:00:02.666 --> 1:00:05.000
Thanks.

1:00:05.002 --> 1:00:07.703
I mean, you could totally pull
off living in your car though.

1:00:07.705 --> 1:00:10.372
[laughing]

1:00:10.374 --> 1:00:12.374
I concur.

1:00:12.376 --> 1:00:14.042
<i> Look, Wyatt, you're good,</i>

1:00:14.044 --> 1:00:16.211
<i> and we could really</i>
<i> use a guy like you.</i>

1:00:16.213 --> 1:00:17.946
- You mean that?
<i> - Of course, man.</i>

1:00:17.948 --> 1:00:19.381
<i> There's been talks</i>
<i> about moving you up</i>

1:00:19.383 --> 1:00:21.817
<i> to full-time</i>
<i> fuckin' staff writer.</i>

1:00:21.819 --> 1:00:27.122
That's-- That's amazing.
I would really like that.

1:00:27.124 --> 1:00:28.290
[laughs]

1:00:30.828 --> 1:00:34.930
So much body and volume.

1:00:34.932 --> 1:00:38.066
Look at that beautiful shine.

1:00:38.068 --> 1:00:41.336
Is that Pantene?

1:00:41.338 --> 1:00:44.806
- Yes, it is! Very good.
- [laughing]

1:00:46.977 --> 1:00:48.076
[sniffs]

1:00:49.113 --> 1:00:51.279
Is that Head & Shoulders?

1:00:51.281 --> 1:00:53.281
Yeah, it is!
[laughs]

1:00:53.283 --> 1:00:55.283
I knew it.

1:00:59.390 --> 1:01:00.956
No, of course.
[hiccup]

1:01:00.958 --> 1:01:03.859
I-- I really wanna work
with you guys.

1:01:03.861 --> 1:01:07.095
That's all I ever wanted.

1:01:07.097 --> 1:01:09.398
<i> Then finish the job.</i>

1:01:11.869 --> 1:01:14.302
Okay, no, um, I'm sorry.

1:01:14.304 --> 1:01:17.039
I'm just really drunk and--

1:01:17.041 --> 1:01:19.207
- Yeah, I am too.
- I have to go.

1:01:20.411 --> 1:01:23.412
[vomits, groans]

1:01:23.414 --> 1:01:25.113
Fuck.

1:01:41.799 --> 1:01:43.899
I just woke up.

1:01:43.901 --> 1:01:46.702
What happened last night?

1:01:46.704 --> 1:01:48.470
We got drunk.

1:01:48.472 --> 1:01:50.472
Well, I know you got drunk.

1:01:53.110 --> 1:01:55.177
You slept over.

1:01:55.179 --> 1:01:57.245
Yeah, I know.

1:01:57.247 --> 1:01:59.848
I don't even remember
falling asleep.

1:01:59.850 --> 1:02:01.983
I found you on the floor.

1:02:04.088 --> 1:02:06.088
Yeah, that sounds like me.

1:02:10.728 --> 1:02:12.728
I need to eat.

1:02:13.797 --> 1:02:16.064
You wanna go somewhere?

1:02:16.066 --> 1:02:18.166
No, I've got stuff to do.

1:02:21.472 --> 1:02:24.005
But I thought we were
going to the ranch.

1:02:28.078 --> 1:02:30.879
- Okay, what's up?
- Nothing.

1:02:30.881 --> 1:02:32.881
Are you angry at me?

1:02:32.883 --> 1:02:35.517
No, I--
I just gotta go.

1:02:35.519 --> 1:02:37.352
Fern, wait.

1:02:51.235 --> 1:02:54.970
Oh, man, dude,
my head's killing me.

1:02:59.476 --> 1:03:02.944
Hey, should we be
concerned about Farid?

1:03:02.946 --> 1:03:05.213
Fern was acting
really weird this morning.

1:03:05.215 --> 1:03:08.850
Kinda left without saying bye.

1:03:08.852 --> 1:03:11.253
Well, she does have ovaries.

1:03:12.856 --> 1:03:14.923
Oh, fuck me.

1:03:14.925 --> 1:03:16.792
MAHONEY: There's my champ.

1:03:20.164 --> 1:03:24.299
Did anything strange happen
last night after I left?

1:03:24.301 --> 1:03:26.902
No. We just talked.

1:03:26.904 --> 1:03:28.904
Just talked, huh?

1:03:32.543 --> 1:03:35.410
I was asleep, bro.

1:03:35.412 --> 1:03:37.412
Drunk as hell.

1:03:39.116 --> 1:03:41.116
What happened last night?

1:03:45.455 --> 1:03:48.156
We just made out for a second,
and she backed away.

1:03:48.158 --> 1:03:50.025
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah, no, no, no.

1:03:50.027 --> 1:03:51.827
I got the story, man.
I get it. No, no.

1:03:51.829 --> 1:03:54.296
I had a few drinks in me,
I was getting a little wasted,

1:03:54.298 --> 1:03:56.131
one thing led to another,
before you know it,

1:03:56.133 --> 1:03:57.999
I got my hand around her,
yeah, I got it!

1:03:58.001 --> 1:03:59.568
I made a mistake.

1:03:59.570 --> 1:04:02.871
You know, I would expect
this stuff from Barrett,

1:04:02.873 --> 1:04:05.140
this being Scum Palace
and all, but you?

1:04:05.142 --> 1:04:06.541
I thought it would
help the story.

1:04:06.543 --> 1:04:08.343
How does that make any sense?

1:04:08.345 --> 1:04:12.147
You're way too invested in her.
You said it yourself.

1:04:12.149 --> 1:04:14.916
This should be about business,
not romance.

1:04:14.918 --> 1:04:16.051
Can't you see that?

1:04:16.053 --> 1:04:18.053
I want you to move out.

1:04:21.491 --> 1:04:22.591
You don't mean that.

1:04:22.593 --> 1:04:24.392
Why wouldn't I?

1:04:24.394 --> 1:04:26.161
We're geography friends.

1:04:26.163 --> 1:04:30.532
I only hang out with you
because I live with you.

1:04:30.534 --> 1:04:32.067
If I met you on the street,

1:04:32.069 --> 1:04:33.602
if I just didn't
even really know you,

1:04:33.604 --> 1:04:36.404
I would never
hang out with you.

1:04:36.406 --> 1:04:39.307
I thought it wasn't
about her, man.

1:04:39.309 --> 1:04:43.211
She doesn't even know about
the articles yet, does she?

1:04:47.217 --> 1:04:50.085
I'm sorry that
you had to witness that.

1:04:50.087 --> 1:04:52.254
I'm disappointed
in the both of you.

1:05:04.368 --> 1:05:06.067
I'm low on coolant.

1:05:06.069 --> 1:05:07.969
Yeah, me too.

1:05:14.211 --> 1:05:16.278
So you wanna talk
about Mahoney?

1:05:19.650 --> 1:05:23.151
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have.

1:05:25.289 --> 1:05:26.421
Do you like him?

1:05:26.423 --> 1:05:27.622
No. He's repugnant.

1:05:27.624 --> 1:05:30.325
So why did you do it then?

1:05:30.327 --> 1:05:32.193
I'm low on oil too.

1:05:32.195 --> 1:05:34.195
Could you just stop looking at
your fucking car for a second

1:05:34.197 --> 1:05:35.263
and talk to me?

1:05:35.265 --> 1:05:36.564
You know what?

1:05:36.566 --> 1:05:39.367
Maybe I'm just not ready
for this, okay?

1:05:43.640 --> 1:05:45.307
Why are you shutting down?

1:05:45.309 --> 1:05:47.309
'Cause that's what I do.

1:05:49.947 --> 1:05:51.446
You said to me--

1:05:51.448 --> 1:05:53.348
You said you were scared
of happiness back in the woods

1:05:53.350 --> 1:05:56.217
because it ends eventually,
right?

1:05:56.219 --> 1:05:58.653
Everything ends when you die,
so what, does nothing matter?

1:06:00.324 --> 1:06:02.324
I can't believe it, Fern,

1:06:02.326 --> 1:06:05.093
like after everything that
we've been through together,

1:06:05.095 --> 1:06:07.562
after everything
I've done for you, you just--

1:06:07.564 --> 1:06:09.397
You just go behind my back.

1:06:09.399 --> 1:06:11.499
It was just overwhelming, okay?

1:06:11.501 --> 1:06:12.600
So I freaked out.

1:06:12.602 --> 1:06:15.337
I freaked out because...

1:06:15.339 --> 1:06:16.972
because I like you.

1:06:16.974 --> 1:06:17.405
I like you a lot.

1:06:22.179 --> 1:06:23.645
I just thought
it would be a way out,

1:06:23.647 --> 1:06:26.581
and I wouldn't
have to be scared.

1:06:28.352 --> 1:06:32.454
I've had a lot of broken
relationships in my life, Wyatt.

1:06:33.523 --> 1:06:34.990
I'm sorry.

1:06:34.992 --> 1:06:38.693
It didn't mean anything
to me, okay?

1:06:38.695 --> 1:06:42.063
Can we just forget about it?

1:06:42.065 --> 1:06:43.598
Please?

1:07:02.386 --> 1:07:05.787
Honestly, I don't care anymore.
Let's just--

1:07:05.789 --> 1:07:07.789
Let's just go to the ranch.

1:07:07.791 --> 1:07:09.791
Let's find your dad.

1:07:12.362 --> 1:07:14.362
We're so close.

1:07:17.034 --> 1:07:18.500
Thanks.

1:07:19.603 --> 1:07:21.603
You're a good person, Wyatt.

1:07:27.177 --> 1:07:29.277
No, I'm not.

1:07:30.514 --> 1:07:32.313
I'm not, actually.

1:07:32.315 --> 1:07:35.283
Fern, I should tell you.

1:07:35.285 --> 1:07:36.418
Um...

1:07:37.554 --> 1:07:39.120
What?

1:07:39.122 --> 1:07:41.289
I...

1:07:42.759 --> 1:07:44.359
What is it?

1:07:44.361 --> 1:07:46.094
What?

1:07:48.799 --> 1:07:51.199
Wyatt?

1:07:51.201 --> 1:07:52.567
Wyatt.

1:07:52.569 --> 1:07:54.302
[snoring]

1:07:55.705 --> 1:07:57.405
Just sleep.

1:07:57.407 --> 1:07:59.507
It's okay.

1:07:59.509 --> 1:08:01.276
Just sleep.

1:08:07.584 --> 1:08:12.687
So what were you gonna tell me
right before you passed out?

1:08:12.689 --> 1:08:14.689
Oh, I don't remember.

1:08:15.692 --> 1:08:17.358
The place is so green.

1:08:25.569 --> 1:08:27.335
It does exist.

1:08:27.337 --> 1:08:29.871
I guess this is it.

1:08:32.776 --> 1:08:35.777
Dr. Green wasn't
lying to us after all.

1:08:37.147 --> 1:08:39.447
Look, they have archery.
Exciting.

1:08:39.449 --> 1:08:41.282
Stop the car.

1:08:41.284 --> 1:08:42.484
- Stop the car!
- Okay, okay!

1:08:50.861 --> 1:08:56.197
<i> ¶¶ [guitar, whistling]</i>

1:08:58.301 --> 1:09:00.301
- I knew it.
- He can paint too.

1:09:04.674 --> 1:09:05.740
Simon?

1:09:09.613 --> 1:09:10.712
Simon!

1:09:10.714 --> 1:09:11.813
Hey, look, look.

1:09:11.815 --> 1:09:13.515
Look at that one over there.

1:09:58.328 --> 1:09:59.394
Hi.

1:09:59.396 --> 1:10:01.763
Hi. I'm Bill.

1:10:01.765 --> 1:10:04.866
I run Shady Acres.

1:10:04.868 --> 1:10:06.367
Hey, I'm Wyatt.

1:10:06.369 --> 1:10:08.636
Nice to meet you, Wyatt.

1:10:08.638 --> 1:10:10.638
And you must be Fern.

1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:11.973
Yeah.

1:10:11.975 --> 1:10:14.342
Your father told me
you'd come.

1:10:15.779 --> 1:10:18.980
Your likeness is
all over this place.

1:10:20.217 --> 1:10:22.250
So what do you guys do here?

1:10:22.252 --> 1:10:26.421
We provide help
to anyone who needs it.

1:10:26.423 --> 1:10:28.856
Let me show you.

1:10:30.493 --> 1:10:35.697
Here we rehabilitate
the mind, body, and soul.

1:10:35.699 --> 1:10:37.532
These are the main grounds.

1:10:37.534 --> 1:10:40.268
Some of the buildings
are a little drab,

1:10:40.270 --> 1:10:44.305
but your father was commissioned
to put a friendly face on them.

1:10:44.307 --> 1:10:46.441
- See that mural right there?
- Mm-hmm.

1:10:46.443 --> 1:10:48.876
Your father painted that.

1:10:48.878 --> 1:10:53.314
Simon was
an incredibly talented man.

1:10:53.316 --> 1:10:55.850
What do you mean, was?

1:11:02.859 --> 1:11:05.426
He used to talk about you

1:11:05.428 --> 1:11:07.929
like you were always
in communication.

1:11:07.931 --> 1:11:09.931
What's with
all the past tense?

1:11:16.473 --> 1:11:18.806
Fern...

1:11:18.808 --> 1:11:21.943
your dad passed
four months ago.

1:11:23.313 --> 1:11:27.382
It was peaceful,
in his sleep.

1:11:28.818 --> 1:11:30.418
I'm so sorry.

1:11:34.391 --> 1:11:36.391
I'll give you a moment.

1:11:41.731 --> 1:11:43.798
Fern...

1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:45.800
Fern, I'm sorry.

1:11:49.039 --> 1:11:51.539
I can't believe he left again.

1:11:52.909 --> 1:11:55.343
He didn't even wait for me.

1:12:05.955 --> 1:12:07.822
He's gone.

1:12:09.526 --> 1:12:11.793
Don't, don't say that.
I mean...

1:12:13.997 --> 1:12:15.430
WYATT: I'm sorry.

1:12:17.967 --> 1:12:19.901
I wanna go home.

1:12:19.903 --> 1:12:21.436
Okay.

1:12:38.755 --> 1:12:40.455
What was he like?

1:12:40.457 --> 1:12:42.724
He was a good friend.

1:12:42.726 --> 1:12:44.726
I didn't know much
about his past.

1:12:44.728 --> 1:12:46.094
[chuckles]

1:12:46.096 --> 1:12:49.097
Well, I don't even think
he knew.

1:12:49.099 --> 1:12:52.066
He just told me
that he had a daughter,

1:12:52.068 --> 1:12:54.769
and everything he did
was for her.

1:12:54.771 --> 1:12:57.772
I don't think
I'll ever understand him.

1:12:57.774 --> 1:13:01.909
Your dad suffered from
schizophrenia, big time.

1:13:01.911 --> 1:13:06.547
He was picked up for roaming
the streets, sometimes naked.

1:13:06.549 --> 1:13:08.916
On more than one occasion,
we petitioned the authorities

1:13:08.918 --> 1:13:14.389
to let him stay here,
rather than be sent to prison.

1:13:14.391 --> 1:13:16.824
Simon was no criminal.

1:13:16.826 --> 1:13:19.761
He just had
mental health issues.

1:13:19.763 --> 1:13:21.129
He looked happy.

1:13:21.131 --> 1:13:24.565
He was great,
when he was taking his meds.

1:13:24.567 --> 1:13:26.868
Easy to get along with.

1:13:28.438 --> 1:13:30.905
I'm glad you came, Fern.

1:13:32.742 --> 1:13:34.909
He's still here,
in a way.

1:13:37.647 --> 1:13:40.648
[birds chirping]

1:13:51.528 --> 1:13:53.060
Where's his grave?

1:13:53.062 --> 1:13:55.997
There isn't one.

1:13:55.999 --> 1:13:59.100
Someone picked up his ashes from
the mortuary before we could.

1:14:01.671 --> 1:14:03.438
[sighs]
Gangrene.

1:14:05.942 --> 1:14:07.008
[knocking]

1:14:07.010 --> 1:14:09.577
We need to talk, Dr. Gangrene.

1:14:09.579 --> 1:14:10.645
Fern?

1:14:12.982 --> 1:14:15.783
Hey. Hey.

1:14:18.955 --> 1:14:21.155
Do you wanna sit down?

1:14:21.157 --> 1:14:22.957
You know why we're here.

1:14:22.959 --> 1:14:24.725
No. What?

1:14:24.727 --> 1:14:26.160
Why did you lie?

1:14:29.666 --> 1:14:33.034
- Well, Fern, he asked me to.
- Oh, please, yeah, right.

1:14:33.036 --> 1:14:34.769
What would you have done, huh?
What would you have done

1:14:34.771 --> 1:14:37.038
if I told you he was dead
in the letter?

1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:38.906
Would you have come? No.

1:14:38.908 --> 1:14:42.043
You would've stayed
right where you are.

1:14:42.045 --> 1:14:46.647
He wanted you to see
all the things that he's built.

1:14:47.951 --> 1:14:49.951
He wanted you
to get a glimpse.

1:14:51.054 --> 1:14:52.720
It wasn't fair.

1:14:52.722 --> 1:14:54.188
Don't tell me about fair.

1:14:54.190 --> 1:14:56.224
I live underneath
a fucking bridge, Fern.

1:14:56.226 --> 1:14:59.894
Guess what, honey?
Life isn't fair.

1:14:59.896 --> 1:15:01.662
Your father wanted you
to see how he lived

1:15:01.664 --> 1:15:04.065
the last days of his life,
and that's what he did.

1:15:04.067 --> 1:15:06.534
So you put clues
all over the city

1:15:06.536 --> 1:15:09.237
and just sent us
wandering around.

1:15:09.239 --> 1:15:10.738
What?

1:15:10.740 --> 1:15:13.174
Come on, the masks,

1:15:13.176 --> 1:15:15.843
the medical bracelet,
the files?

1:15:15.845 --> 1:15:17.712
That was all you, right?

1:15:17.714 --> 1:15:19.280
That would be insane.

1:15:19.282 --> 1:15:22.116
Yeah, that would be insane.

1:15:22.118 --> 1:15:23.618
What is this?

1:15:23.620 --> 1:15:25.653
The ashes, you have them.

1:15:25.655 --> 1:15:27.622
No, I don't.

1:15:27.624 --> 1:15:29.290
Will you just stop
lying to us?

1:15:29.292 --> 1:15:31.158
You keep them
in that yellow container.

1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:32.960
What are you talking about?
I don't have his ashes!

1:15:32.962 --> 1:15:34.095
Yes, you do!

1:15:34.097 --> 1:15:37.732
Hey, what are you doing?
No, no!

1:15:37.734 --> 1:15:39.967
- Oh, my God!
- No, no!

1:15:39.969 --> 1:15:41.035
I got it, Fern!

1:15:41.037 --> 1:15:42.136
Be careful!

1:15:45.909 --> 1:15:49.176
- Fern, take it!
- You son of a bitch!

1:15:49.178 --> 1:15:51.646
No! You son of a bitch!

1:15:52.682 --> 1:15:54.248
- [snaps]
- [screams]

1:15:54.250 --> 1:15:56.250
[groaning]

1:16:00.657 --> 1:16:03.190
You broke my fucking foot!

1:16:04.661 --> 1:16:06.327
Don't! Fern!

1:16:06.329 --> 1:16:08.629
Thanks for all your help,
Dr. Green.

1:16:08.631 --> 1:16:10.631
Don't do that!
Don't, please.

1:16:10.633 --> 1:16:12.567
It's all I got.
It's all I got of him, please.

1:16:12.569 --> 1:16:14.635
I hope everything
works out for you.

1:16:14.637 --> 1:16:18.105
Don't! Fern, Fern!

1:16:18.107 --> 1:16:20.074
Fern, it's mine!

1:16:20.076 --> 1:16:23.611
Fern! Fern!

1:16:36.359 --> 1:16:38.659
I'm gonna keep some of him.

1:16:47.070 --> 1:16:49.704
Here you lie, finally,

1:16:49.706 --> 1:16:51.706
in a permanent home.

1:16:59.082 --> 1:17:01.349
Well, sorta permanent.

1:17:03.653 --> 1:17:06.787
I hope you found the peace
you've been searching for, Dad.

1:17:08.958 --> 1:17:13.127
Rest in peace, Mr. Darby.

1:17:13.129 --> 1:17:16.330
<i> ¶¶</i>

1:17:18.301 --> 1:17:21.902
I was kinda hoping he'd be
some sort of millionaire

1:17:21.904 --> 1:17:23.838
with a big family,

1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:26.273
and then
I could really hate him.

1:17:26.275 --> 1:17:29.176
But I just kinda
feel bad for him now.

1:17:29.178 --> 1:17:33.848
Well, I think that's better
than hating him.

1:17:33.850 --> 1:17:35.950
Hate's easier.

1:17:38.988 --> 1:17:40.688
Move in with me.

1:17:40.690 --> 1:17:43.324
[scoffs]
You don't want that.

1:17:43.326 --> 1:17:45.860
I do.

1:17:45.862 --> 1:17:48.863
You can get a job,
get back on your feet.

1:17:48.865 --> 1:17:50.398
I don't know.

1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:53.000
I'm not asking you sign
a one-year lease with me, okay?

1:17:53.002 --> 1:17:56.337
It's just move in,
we'll try it,

1:17:56.339 --> 1:17:58.339
and we'll see
how it works, okay?

1:18:04.113 --> 1:18:05.179
Okay.

1:18:16.192 --> 1:18:18.993
Here's a cupboard for you
to put your clothes in.

1:18:18.995 --> 1:18:21.462
- Thanks.
- And actually, you know what?

1:18:21.464 --> 1:18:24.265
You could use the closet
as an art studio.

1:18:24.267 --> 1:18:26.734
Oh, yeah, that could work.

1:18:27.970 --> 1:18:29.970
We can move your stuff
in tonight.

1:18:41.284 --> 1:18:43.484
We'll go job hunting
next week.

1:18:43.486 --> 1:18:45.820
- [urinating]
- You can park in the garage.

1:18:45.822 --> 1:18:47.021
Guys won't mind.

1:19:05.007 --> 1:19:06.340
And you know what, actually?
We have a laundry machine

1:19:06.342 --> 1:19:07.942
that doesn't even need
quarters.

1:19:07.944 --> 1:19:10.211
So you know,
no more Laundromat.

1:19:15.084 --> 1:19:17.251
How's that sound?

1:19:17.253 --> 1:19:19.019
"Her father is mentally ill,

1:19:19.021 --> 1:19:21.322
and she, it seems,
is mentally ill too,

1:19:21.324 --> 1:19:25.092
but I still love every moment
spent with her."

1:19:26.095 --> 1:19:27.394
Okay, Fern,

1:19:27.396 --> 1:19:29.163
I was gonna tell you,
I swear.

1:19:29.165 --> 1:19:31.165
"Sometimes I envied
her tough life,

1:19:31.167 --> 1:19:33.000
wrought with pain
and struggle,

1:19:33.002 --> 1:19:37.471
mine being a prepackaged
suburban nightmare of boredom."

1:19:37.473 --> 1:19:39.440
You used me.

1:19:39.442 --> 1:19:42.476
You used me too.
You used me to find Simon.

1:19:44.847 --> 1:19:47.515
I didn't knock
on your window that night.

1:19:49.519 --> 1:19:54.855
Okay, look, all they want
is one more article from me.

1:19:54.857 --> 1:19:58.259
The ending
to this sad, sad tale.

1:19:58.261 --> 1:20:01.996
- I'm not going to submit it.
- Why not?

1:20:01.998 --> 1:20:04.098
I shouldn't have done this
in the first place, okay?

1:20:04.100 --> 1:20:05.900
You're right.
They're a terrible company,

1:20:05.902 --> 1:20:08.335
and I just wanted
to impress them, okay?

She could literally
be anywhere

Dude, she abandoned you.

1:24:53.456 --> 1:24:55.856
She just left
without saying a word.

1:24:55.858 --> 1:24:57.691
It was all my fault.

1:24:57.693 --> 1:25:00.794
You did help her out a lot.

1:25:00.796 --> 1:25:04.631

- Oh, come on.

That's no fun.
Let's do this.

1:26:23.879 --> 1:26:26.580
Let's twist it up
a little bit so that he--

1:26:26.582 --> 1:26:29.383
Wow, this is a really big spot
you've got here.

No, I don't think
I'm gonna do that at all.

He can't just be dead.
