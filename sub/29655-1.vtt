[drum thumping]

00:15.754 --> 00:18.235
[gentle music]

00:44.653 --> 00:46.394
- Hey baby!

00:48.700 --> 00:50.441
Junebug.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.488
Are you in there?

00:53.488 --> 00:54.271
- Boo!
[Maggie shrieks]

00:54.271 --> 00:56.143
[laughs] You got me.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.275
- Mommy, read to me?

00:58.275 --> 00:59.407
- Oh sweetie, I'm sorry.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.452
I would love to, but
Mommy's gotta get to work.

01:02.845 --> 01:04.150
- Are you driving?

01:04.150 --> 01:06.370
- No silly, I am the medic.

01:06.370 --> 01:07.719
I give people their shots.

01:07.719 --> 01:10.070
[both laugh]

01:12.115 --> 01:14.378
- Drivin' a ambulance.

01:14.378 --> 01:15.814
It looks more fun.

01:15.814 --> 01:17.903
- You know what, I bet
sometimes it is more fun.

01:18.774 --> 01:21.385
But I bet if you
ask Daddy nicely,

01:21.385 --> 01:22.604
he'll read to you.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.432
[Young Girl]
Daddy, will you read to me,

01:24.432 --> 01:25.520
please?

01:25.520 --> 01:29.132
[inhales sharply] Um, well,

01:29.132 --> 01:30.568
I guess so.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.223
[Mommy laughs]

01:33.223 --> 01:34.790
Please be careful.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.183
Little girls need their mothers.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.575
- And their father.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.055
She's lucky to have both.

01:40.404 --> 01:41.797
Bye.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.712
- All right, you know
what I saw under your bed?

01:43.712 --> 01:45.148
It was a tickle monster!

01:45.148 --> 01:46.410
[young girl laughs]
My goodness.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.020
What is this?

01:48.020 --> 01:50.240
What is this, okay let's see.

[gentle music]

01:59.641 --> 02:01.164
[door snaps shut]
- Hey.

02:01.164 --> 02:01.991
Is it safe?

02:03.384 --> 02:04.950
- He was waiting up for you.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.604
[sighs] I'm so sorry.

02:07.736 --> 02:09.738
I was working on a
deal for the lease

02:09.738 --> 02:12.001
of our new offices.

02:12.001 --> 02:14.395
- It's okay, I put him to sleep.

02:14.395 --> 02:18.225
So the new offices,
did you close the deal?

02:18.225 --> 02:20.096
- We're close.
[woman sighs]

02:20.096 --> 02:21.532
Moving the real estate firm

02:21.532 --> 02:23.186
to the valley is
the right thing.

02:23.186 --> 02:25.493
Most of our clients are there.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.669
Property values
are skyrocketing.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.192
We stand to make a fortune.

02:29.192 --> 02:32.543
- Yeah I know, it's just, ugh.

02:32.543 --> 02:34.023
I hate change.

02:34.023 --> 02:37.809
I like to grab onto
things and hold them close

02:37.809 --> 02:38.810
[man laughs]
like I do with you.

02:38.810 --> 02:39.985
[Man] Oh!

02:41.944 --> 02:43.946
[Woman] Ooh, very fun.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.687
- Yeah, you think he'll like it?

02:45.687 --> 02:47.036
[Woman] He'll like it,
he'll love it.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.124
- Good.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.734
[laughs] Where's the bike?
- In the car.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.083
Along with a few other

02:51.083 --> 02:53.042
small surprises.
- Oh my gosh,

02:53.042 --> 02:53.869
you spoil him.

02:53.869 --> 02:55.218
- I love him.

02:55.218 --> 02:56.045

02:56.045 --> 02:56.872

02:57.829 --> 02:59.396
[Man] Mmm, oh, I love you.

02:59.396 --> 03:02.007
- I love you.
[man laughs]

03:02.007 --> 03:03.748
[lips smacking]
[woman exclaims]

03:03.748 --> 03:05.924
The milk, did you get the milk?

03:05.924 --> 03:07.665
[man sighs]
[laughs] Sweetie no!

03:07.665 --> 03:10.320
I wanna make Alston's favorite
pancakes in the morning.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.321
- Ooh, blueberry--
- Yes.

03:11.321 --> 03:12.192
- Look at you.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.410
- Well, it's his birthday.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.107
- So, milk.

03:15.107 --> 03:16.370

03:16.370 --> 03:17.240
And bacon.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.633

03:18.633 --> 03:20.548
[laughs] And the french
toast that he loves.

03:20.548 --> 03:21.505
[Man] [laughs]
Oh, anything else?

03:21.505 --> 03:23.159
- No, no, no, that's all.

03:23.159 --> 03:24.291
But the store's gonna be closed.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.857
You're gonna have to
go to the Kwik Mart.

03:25.857 --> 03:26.815
[man groans]
It's his birthday,

03:26.815 --> 03:27.946
he loves pancakes.

03:27.946 --> 03:29.252
- I know.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.949
Six years old.

03:30.949 --> 03:31.820
They grow so fast.

03:31.820 --> 03:32.995
- They sure do.

03:32.995 --> 03:34.736
Okay, go.
- Yep.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.912
[Woman] I love you, thank you!

03:36.912 --> 03:38.174
Be back soon!

03:38.174 --> 03:40.002
- I promise, I'll be
back before you know it.

03:40.002 --> 03:42.265
- And I'll be waiting.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.266
[Man] Waiting is even better.

03:43.266 --> 03:44.615
[woman laughs]

03:44.615 --> 03:46.008
[crickets chirping]

03:46.008 --> 03:47.314
- Get excited.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.447
You hungry partner?

03:50.447 --> 03:51.753
Got your favorite.

03:51.753 --> 03:54.712
A little gas station
salad action, no flavor.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.018
- My favorite.

03:56.018 --> 03:59.064
- I know, I know what is
your favorite. [laughs]

03:59.064 --> 04:00.544
Oh yeah, french fries.

04:00.544 --> 04:02.242
[woman laughs and groans]
Vegans can eat those, right?

04:02.242 --> 04:03.155
- Mm hmm.

04:03.155 --> 04:04.113
- Right, you like those.

04:04.113 --> 04:05.332
- I'll have all of these,
thank you.

04:05.332 --> 04:08.073
- You can have those, but
you know what you can't have?

04:08.073 --> 04:11.599
This big, juicy, delicious,
carnivorous burger.

04:11.599 --> 04:12.730
Mmm.

04:12.730 --> 04:13.992

04:21.261 --> 04:23.132
We gotta go.

We are on the scene.

[Military Man] Sniper,

04:57.645 --> 04:59.255

[man groans]
[explosions booming]

05:01.779 --> 05:03.433
- No Maggie, Maggie,
Maggie, what are you doin'?

05:03.433 --> 05:05.087
Maggie, the situation
is not secure, Maggie!

05:05.087 --> 05:06.480
The gunman is still here.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.568
- I can't let them die.

05:07.568 --> 05:08.438

Maggie, Maggie, Maggie!

- Okay.

05:22.147 --> 05:23.410
- Maggie, this is
not a war zone.

05:23.410 --> 05:24.715
We have to get back to
the ambulance right now.

He died when I was young.

certified in the last two years,

she's not here, okay?

40:33.561 --> 40:34.170
Just take whatever--

40:34.170 --> 40:34.910
[gun smashing]

40:34.910 --> 40:35.911
[Jason groans] - Dad!

Shut up!

40:58.673 --> 41:00.719

41:00.719 --> 41:03.330
I heard some screams.
You need to send somebody.

41:04.897 --> 41:07.552

Go.

[Jason groaning]

41:56.731 --> 41:58.733
- Jason?

41:58.733 --> 42:00.213
[Jason crying out]
What happened?

42:00.213 --> 42:01.257
Let me take a look.

42:01.257 --> 42:03.042
- Jane, Jane!

42:04.391 --> 42:05.871
[phone rings]

42:05.871 --> 42:08.047
Get that.
It could be about her.

42:08.047 --> 42:10.310
[phone beeps]

42:10.310 --> 42:12.921
[Hitman] Call the cops and
your little girl is dead.

42:12.921 --> 42:14.444
- Who is this?

42:14.444 --> 42:16.359
[Hitman] Someone who's
not messin' around.

42:16.359 --> 42:17.578
- Mom!

42:17.578 --> 42:18.797
- No police.

42:18.797 --> 42:20.146
- Jane!

42:21.408 --> 42:22.670
Jane!

42:27.370 --> 42:28.720
I'm callin' the cops.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.112
- No, no, no don't.

42:30.112 --> 42:32.245
Don't, they'll kill her.

42:32.245 --> 42:36.684
[sirens wailing] [both gasp]
They can't see me like this.

42:36.684 --> 42:39.295
The police'll ask questions,
and they'll kill Jane.

42:39.295 --> 42:41.167
You got to pick me up.

42:41.167 --> 42:42.908

- Okay, okay come on, let's go.

42:46.346 --> 42:49.523

42:49.523 --> 42:50.742
- What are you doing,

42:50.742 --> 42:51.960
you left the husband behind?

42:51.960 --> 42:53.005
- Change of plans.

42:53.005 --> 42:53.962
- No, no, no, no!

42:53.962 --> 42:55.137
This isn't what I paid you for!

42:55.137 --> 42:56.443
- Hey, shut up.

42:56.443 --> 42:58.010
You'll get what you paid for.

43:00.186 --> 43:01.361
[Jane cries out]

43:03.015 --> 43:05.017
Stay tuned.

43:09.587 --> 43:11.414
- This coulda been a lot worse.

43:11.414 --> 43:13.721
[gasps] I don't know
how that could be.

43:15.897 --> 43:17.551
[doorbell rings]

43:25.690 --> 43:27.517
[gasps] It's the police.

43:27.517 --> 43:29.215
[groans] Miss Sing.

43:29.215 --> 43:31.217
She must've heard Jane scream.

43:32.392 --> 43:33.523
You gotta go get rid of 'em.

43:35.134 --> 43:36.439
- Don't move.

43:43.838 --> 43:45.231
Hello.

43:45.231 --> 43:46.841

43:46.841 --> 43:48.451
- Is everything okay?

43:48.451 --> 43:49.714
- No, your neighbor's been shot.

43:51.019 --> 43:52.107
- Oh my God.

43:52.107 --> 43:53.369
Is she okay?

43:53.369 --> 43:54.980
- She's dead ma'am.

43:54.980 --> 43:56.503
We got a call she
heard screaming,

43:56.503 --> 43:58.244
and then dispatch
reported a gunshot.

43:58.244 --> 43:59.637
Did you see anything?

43:59.637 --> 44:01.160
- No.

44:01.160 --> 44:03.858
I just got home
five minutes ago.

44:03.858 --> 44:05.730
- And the gunshot?

44:06.992 --> 44:08.341
- I didn't hear a thing.

44:08.341 --> 44:09.908
[phone rings]

44:09.908 --> 44:12.084

44:12.084 --> 44:13.389
- It's fine, it's my daughter.

44:13.389 --> 44:14.826
- Where's she?

44:14.826 --> 44:17.567
- Out with friends.

44:17.567 --> 44:19.352
- Anyone else in
the house with you?

44:19.352 --> 44:20.614
- No.

44:20.614 --> 44:22.355
I'm here alone, my
husband's working late.

44:22.355 --> 44:23.704
- Okay.

44:23.704 --> 44:25.663
[phone rings]

44:25.663 --> 44:27.795
- I'm sorry, I really
should take this.

44:27.795 --> 44:29.884
- Lock your doors.

44:29.884 --> 44:32.365
The suspect hasn't been caught.

44:32.365 --> 44:33.758
- Oh my God, of course, yes.

44:33.758 --> 44:36.586
Thank you. Thank you.

44:36.586 --> 44:40.373
[phone rings]

44:40.373 --> 44:41.722
Hello?

44:41.722 --> 44:42.897
- Listen closely, you got me?

44:42.897 --> 44:43.985
Come or she's dead.

44:43.985 --> 44:45.030

44:45.030 --> 44:47.032
[Hitman] 5th and Roosevelt.

44:47.032 --> 44:48.816
Come alone.

44:48.816 --> 44:50.122

44:51.558 --> 44:53.212
[phone beeps]

44:55.910 --> 44:56.824
- What happened?

44:57.956 --> 44:59.435
- I have to go.

44:59.435 --> 45:01.481
- I'm goin' with you.

45:20.805 --> 45:22.154
Get me up.

45:22.154 --> 45:23.590
They'll hurt you.

45:23.590 --> 45:25.374
- Once I find her,
I'll call the police.

45:25.374 --> 45:27.725
I'm gonna play this safe, okay?

45:28.769 --> 45:30.205
You can't move.

45:30.205 --> 45:32.033
You could bleed out.

45:33.600 --> 45:35.428
I closed the wound,

45:35.428 --> 45:36.951
but you can't move.

45:38.257 --> 45:41.521
- Go get our daughter.

[thunderous suspenseful music]

45:53.881 --> 45:56.144

46:08.853 --> 46:09.941

46:11.464 --> 46:12.639
[Hitman] I'll take care of her.

46:12.639 --> 46:14.728
Get the husband.

46:14.728 --> 46:16.774
- I can't, this place
is crawling with cops.

46:18.210 --> 46:19.254
It ain't gonna be easy.

46:19.254 --> 46:20.168
[Hitman] Just do it.

46:21.691 --> 46:23.258

46:49.241 --> 46:51.765
[bag crunches]

47:03.690 --> 47:06.824
You scream, I'll hurt
you, you understand?

47:10.044 --> 47:11.437
Drink.

47:19.314 --> 47:21.447
[Jane sniffles]
Why did you take me?

47:22.883 --> 47:25.277
[bag crunches]
- Somebody paid us to.

47:25.277 --> 47:27.235
- Are you gonna hurt me?

47:27.235 --> 47:28.846
- Yes.

47:30.195 --> 47:31.849
- Are you gonna kill me?

47:38.464 --> 47:40.727
[Jane cries]

47:40.727 --> 47:43.425
Don't worry, your mom
will be here soon.

Don't answer the door, please.

Dammit!

49:00.154 --> 49:01.590

49:01.590 --> 49:04.202
- I'm sorry, I didn't
know who I could trust.

49:04.202 --> 49:05.333
- What are you doing here?

49:06.900 --> 49:09.555
Oh my God, you're hurt!

49:09.555 --> 49:11.078
What happened?

49:12.558 --> 49:15.082
- Some guys broke into our
house and took my daughter.

49:16.649 --> 49:20.914
And they said if I call the
police, they're gonna kill Jane.

49:20.914 --> 49:24.700
I didn't know, I didn't
know who else I could trust.

49:25.919 --> 49:27.355
You gotta help.

49:27.355 --> 49:28.617
- Where's Maggie?

49:28.617 --> 49:30.663
- She went after 'em.

49:30.663 --> 49:31.533
- Alone?

49:31.533 --> 49:33.144
- Yeah.

49:33.144 --> 49:35.407
- Come inside.
I have some pain pills.

49:35.407 --> 49:37.278
[Jason grunts]
Come in.

49:47.854 --> 49:49.769
- I'm sorry.

49:49.769 --> 49:52.032
- Well you should be, for
getting me into this.

49:52.032 --> 49:56.036
[Jason groans]
You're bleeding everywhere.

49:56.036 --> 49:59.561
- Maggie tried to close it up
but I must've ripped it open

49:59.561 --> 50:01.041
on the drive over.

50:03.304 --> 50:07.656
[pants] All I need is a
new bandage or somethin'.

50:07.656 --> 50:09.354

I'll be right back.

50:10.746 --> 50:11.878

[Jason grunts]

50:25.109 --> 50:26.284
[phone beeps]

50:26.284 --> 50:27.981
Why is he here?

50:27.981 --> 50:29.374
- Somethin' happened.

50:29.374 --> 50:30.766
There were cops
crawlin' everywhere.

50:30.766 --> 50:32.290
Gotta lay low.

50:32.290 --> 50:33.813
- He's bleeding
all over the house!

50:33.813 --> 50:35.119
It ties me to this!

50:35.119 --> 50:36.511
- I'm gonna come get him.

50:36.511 --> 50:38.209
- No, if you come
and get him now,

50:38.209 --> 50:39.906
I'll look like an
accomplice, no.

50:39.906 --> 50:42.952
No, we have to think
of something else.

50:42.952 --> 50:45.129
I blame you for all of this.

50:45.129 --> 50:46.739
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, wait a second.

50:46.739 --> 50:49.307
If you didn't let that brat
in your house this afternoon,

50:49.307 --> 50:50.830
none of this woulda happened.

50:50.830 --> 50:52.310
- Who was in my house?

50:52.310 --> 50:54.225
- Jane!

50:54.225 --> 50:56.618
- What?

50:59.404 --> 51:00.622
Will you shut up and
give me a second?

51:07.586 --> 51:09.675
I need time to think.

51:09.675 --> 51:10.719

- Shut up!

55:32.241 --> 55:36.594
[sirens wailing]

55:36.594 --> 55:38.813
Make a noise, and you're dead.

55:47.518 --> 55:50.042
Francisco, it's me.

55:50.042 --> 55:51.478
Do it now.

55:56.222 --> 55:57.005
- Yeah.

55:57.005 --> 55:58.050
- What are you doing?

55:58.050 --> 55:59.530
- Doin' the job.

55:59.530 --> 56:02.271
- Well your partner just got
in a gunfight with Maggie.

56:02.271 --> 56:04.665
His camera's down and I
can't see what's going on!

56:04.665 --> 56:06.537
[Wade] I need to call him.

56:06.537 --> 56:09.670
- If you screw this up,
you don't get a dime.

56:09.670 --> 56:11.019
[Wade] I know the deal.

56:11.019 --> 56:12.847
[Victoria exhales sharply]

56:20.768 --> 56:23.162
- Come on ass, do it, do it now!

56:25.077 --> 56:27.340
[explosion booming]

56:35.783 --> 56:42.094
[sirens wailing]

56:42.094 --> 56:43.530
Yes!

56:43.530 --> 56:45.619
Pays to have friends
in the right places.

56:45.619 --> 56:47.360
[Jane cries]

56:49.971 --> 56:53.018
[Maggie grunts]

56:53.018 --> 56:57.501
[Jane sniffles]

57:06.510 --> 57:09.382
So what are you,
a sharp-shooter?

57:09.382 --> 57:11.645
- What are you talkin' about?

57:11.645 --> 57:13.081
- Where'd you learn to shoot?

57:17.782 --> 57:20.872
Look, we can talk or I can
finish this right now.

57:24.876 --> 57:27.444
[Maggie] I was a coreman.

57:27.444 --> 57:29.489
- Respect, I was a Marine.

57:30.925 --> 57:32.492
- How much do you want?

57:34.973 --> 57:38.803
- Normally, I'd
entertain that offer but,

57:38.803 --> 57:40.761
I don't think you
have enough to buy me.

57:41.675 --> 57:43.590
[Maggie exhales]

57:43.590 --> 57:46.158
I'll give you some
time to say goodbye.

57:47.202 --> 57:50.423
I need some sleep anyway.
The sun will be up soon.

57:51.642 --> 57:54.949
[Jane cries]

57:54.949 --> 57:58.475
- Jane, Jane I need
you to calm down.

57:58.475 --> 58:02.304
[Jane cries]

58:02.304 --> 58:05.264
- Mom, he's going to kill us.

58:05.264 --> 58:07.309
- Jane calm down, it's
gonna be okay honey.

58:07.309 --> 58:09.311
- Where's dad, is he okay?

58:09.311 --> 58:11.531
- Dad is fine, he's fine.

58:11.531 --> 58:14.012
You and I, we're gonna
need to work together.

58:14.012 --> 58:15.883
Look at me.

58:15.883 --> 58:17.711
Look at me, we need to work
together if we're gonna get out

58:17.711 --> 58:19.060
of this, okay?

58:24.413 --> 58:25.937
I have a plan.

58:25.937 --> 58:27.765
But I need you to be strong.

58:29.810 --> 58:30.855
I love you.

58:30.855 --> 58:32.813
[cries]

58:32.813 --> 58:34.380
I love you too Mom.

58:39.994 --> 58:43.345
[hawk screeching]
[crow cawing]

58:49.308 --> 58:54.095
[Jane sniffling]

58:54.095 --> 58:55.575
[Maggie yells out]

59:08.501 --> 59:10.459
We're gonna die aren't we?

59:10.459 --> 59:12.940
- Not if I can do
anything about it.

59:12.940 --> 59:15.987
[tense music]

59:15.987 --> 59:20.687
[Maggie cries out]

59:20.687 --> 59:23.472
[knife jiggles and thumps]

59:30.001 --> 59:31.437
- Come on.

59:33.221 --> 59:34.745
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

59:37.095 --> 59:38.400
[Maggie grunts]

59:44.102 --> 59:49.716
[tape tearing]

59:54.155 --> 59:56.201
[knocking at door]

01:00:00.292 --> 01:00:03.295
[Maggie grunts]

01:00:03.295 --> 01:00:04.992
Stay away, stay away.

01:00:07.038 --> 01:00:09.431
[Jane gasps]

01:00:09.431 --> 01:00:10.128
Hold on.

01:00:11.651 --> 01:00:14.088
[tape tearing]

01:00:18.527 --> 01:00:21.052
Jane, follow me out.

01:00:23.358 --> 01:00:24.969
Follow me out.

01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:36.807
[door creaks]

01:00:36.807 --> 01:00:38.330
- What now?
- We get help.

01:00:41.507 --> 01:00:44.858
[door slams]

01:00:44.858 --> 01:00:45.990
[Wade] Hey.

01:00:46.555 --> 01:00:48.122
Hey!

01:00:48.122 --> 01:00:49.776
- What?
- Where are the girls?

01:00:49.776 --> 01:00:51.256
- In there.

01:00:51.256 --> 01:00:53.040
- No they're not.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.128
- What do you mean, they're not?

01:00:55.129 --> 01:00:56.043
- They're not in there.

01:00:56.043 --> 01:00:57.436
- They were just there
a second ago.

01:01:00.918 --> 01:01:01.919
- The door's open.

01:01:03.703 --> 01:01:04.399
Man.

01:01:05.923 --> 01:01:07.446
[footsteps pounding]

01:01:07.446 --> 01:01:09.143
- Come on!
[crow cawing]

01:01:09.143 --> 01:01:11.232
Hurry!

01:01:13.539 --> 01:01:14.888
- Mom,

01:01:16.194 --> 01:01:18.022
I'm sorry.
- You okay?

01:01:18.022 --> 01:01:19.414
- I'm really out of breath.

01:01:19.414 --> 01:01:20.981
- We gotta keep moving.

01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:22.722
- I'm just really thirsty.

01:01:22.722 --> 01:01:24.028
- I know honey.

01:01:24.028 --> 01:01:26.683
I'm sorry, but we
gotta keep goin'.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:28.467
- Okay.

01:01:28.467 --> 01:01:30.077
- I think we're safe now.

01:01:31.426 --> 01:01:33.167
Can you keep going?
- Yeah.

01:01:33.167 --> 01:01:35.648
- All right.
[Jane breathing heavily]

01:01:35.648 --> 01:01:37.389
We'll get help up ahead.

01:01:39.304 --> 01:01:40.914
- They're so scary.

01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:43.003
- I know.

01:01:44.352 --> 01:01:45.484
You're doin' great.

01:01:45.484 --> 01:01:49.880
[footsteps crunching dirt]
[haunting music]

01:01:59.977 --> 01:02:02.457
[Jason coughs]

01:02:06.244 --> 01:02:07.680
- How are you feeling?

01:02:08.376 --> 01:02:09.900
- Okay.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.510
How did I fall asleep?

01:02:12.685 --> 01:02:14.295
Hey what, where's Maggie?

01:02:14.295 --> 01:02:15.862
- I don't know.

01:02:15.862 --> 01:02:17.472
Your phone didn't ring
at all last night.

01:02:19.997 --> 01:02:20.911
- Dammit.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.087
I gotta call the police.

01:02:23.087 --> 01:02:24.828
- And put your family at risk?

01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:26.917
- Well I just can't
lay here in wait.

01:02:26.917 --> 01:02:28.092
- I agree.

01:02:31.008 --> 01:02:32.661
We'll figure something out.

01:02:34.881 --> 01:02:36.143
- How you holdin' up?

01:02:36.143 --> 01:02:37.318
- I'm all right.

01:02:37.318 --> 01:02:38.755
- Can you keep moving?

01:02:40.278 --> 01:02:41.932
We need to be smart.

01:02:41.932 --> 01:02:43.629
We need to be careful,

01:02:43.629 --> 01:02:45.500
and we need to stick
together, okay?

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:48.373
- Why don't we find a
house or something?

01:02:49.287 --> 01:02:50.592
We can get help.

01:02:50.592 --> 01:02:52.159
- We will.

01:02:52.159 --> 01:02:54.161
There's a couple of houses
just over these hills here.

01:02:55.946 --> 01:02:57.904
- Why is this happening?

01:02:57.904 --> 01:02:59.514
- I don't know.

01:03:01.647 --> 01:03:04.432
[melancholy music]

01:03:08.219 --> 01:03:09.698
[Alston] Mom?

01:03:16.053 --> 01:03:17.837
- Alston.

01:03:17.837 --> 01:03:19.186
What are you doing here?

01:03:19.186 --> 01:03:20.622
- I live here.

01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:23.408
You been drinking again?

01:03:23.408 --> 01:03:24.844
- My business, not yours.

01:03:25.932 --> 01:03:27.499
- There's cops next to
Jane's house.

01:03:30.763 --> 01:03:32.504
- I don't want you here.

01:03:32.504 --> 01:03:33.984
- I don't wanna be here.

01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:36.421
I'm just grabbing clothes.

01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:38.075
Grandma said I could
stay with her for awhile.

01:03:38.075 --> 01:03:39.772
- Great, perfect plan.

01:03:41.208 --> 01:03:42.688
- Why do you hate me?

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:51.915
- I think you mistake
pain for hate.

01:03:54.047 --> 01:03:55.483
Now go please.

01:03:56.658 --> 01:03:57.877
Go!

01:04:06.059 --> 01:04:08.453
[phone rings]

01:04:08.453 --> 01:04:09.802
[phone beeps]
What?

01:04:09.802 --> 01:04:11.064
- We have a problem.

01:04:15.025 --> 01:04:16.330
- Besides the man I
paid you to kill

01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:18.419
sleeping in my guest room?

01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:21.379
- Gets worse.
- Oh yes, please do tell me

01:04:21.379 --> 01:04:23.468
how it gets worse than this.

01:04:23.468 --> 01:04:25.165
- Nelson let 'em get away.

01:04:25.165 --> 01:04:27.602
- Oh, you fools!

01:04:27.602 --> 01:04:28.603
[metal clangs]
[gasps]

01:04:28.603 --> 01:04:29.735
Oh no! [gasps]

01:04:29.735 --> 01:04:31.693
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:04:31.693 --> 01:04:34.131
[gasps] No, no please, be okay.

01:04:34.131 --> 01:04:35.219
- Victoria?

01:04:35.784 --> 01:04:37.395
Victoria?

01:04:37.395 --> 01:04:38.439
- I'll take the van.
You go on foot.

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.008
- No, no, no.

01:04:42.008 --> 01:04:43.488
Please, you're okay.

01:04:43.488 --> 01:04:45.229
You're okay, please.

01:04:45.229 --> 01:04:48.319
Please, you're okay.

01:04:48.319 --> 01:04:49.494
No, no, no, no, you're okay.

01:04:49.494 --> 01:04:50.495
- Is everything okay?

01:04:51.931 --> 01:04:56.327
- Yes, my husband gave
me this plant

01:04:56.327 --> 01:04:58.155
as a gift before he died.

01:04:58.155 --> 01:04:59.504
- Oh I'm sorry, here.

01:04:59.504 --> 01:05:01.027
Would you like some--
- No, no, no, no, no,

01:05:01.027 --> 01:05:01.810
no, no, no, no, don't touch!

01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:02.899
Don't touch!

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:05.640
I'm gonna pick all of this up,

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:10.210
and you just, you go rest, okay?
[gasps]

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:13.648
Okay, you're okay.

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:20.438
- [scoffs] Shame on you.

01:05:20.438 --> 01:05:21.918
She's not worth your family.

01:05:23.571 --> 01:05:25.965
[scoffs] So stupid.

01:05:25.965 --> 01:05:27.619
- Oh no, no, no, no,
it's not like that!

01:05:27.619 --> 01:05:30.927
It's, [gasps and groans]

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:32.406
dammit!

01:05:32.406 --> 01:05:34.887
I need to go stop
him and explain.

01:05:34.887 --> 01:05:36.454
- No, don't bother.

01:05:36.454 --> 01:05:38.325
He's thick.

01:05:39.152 --> 01:05:40.501
You know what?

01:05:40.501 --> 01:05:41.546
I have a friend who's
a private investigator.

01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:44.505
Maybe he can help.

01:05:45.898 --> 01:05:50.033
- They did tell Maggie
to go to a Qwik Mart

01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:51.860
at 5th and Roosevelt.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.253
Maybe we go check that out.

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:55.952
- I'll get dressed
and be right back.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.699
- Don't you wanna
know why I did it?

01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:06.266
- Did what?

01:06:06.266 --> 01:06:08.007
- Broke into Alston's house.

01:06:08.007 --> 01:06:12.055
- You broke into Alston's house?

01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:13.665
- It was a stupid love note.

01:06:14.666 --> 01:06:17.190
I left it on Alston's desk.

01:06:18.844 --> 01:06:20.672
I've had a crush
on Alston Garrett.

01:06:23.196 --> 01:06:25.720
Then I saw him kissing some
girl named Ruth the next day.

01:06:27.418 --> 01:06:29.159
Felt like an idiot.

01:06:30.812 --> 01:06:32.814
I went to get the note back,

01:06:32.814 --> 01:06:34.991
and that's when I
saw those guys.

01:06:36.253 --> 01:06:37.558
- In Alston's house?

01:06:37.558 --> 01:06:39.125
- Yeah.

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:41.823
They were messing with the TV.

01:06:41.823 --> 01:06:43.782
They were putting a
camera on it or something.

01:06:43.782 --> 01:06:45.349
- And you saw them doing this?

01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:46.698
- Yeah.

01:06:46.698 --> 01:06:49.701
And then they saw me,
and they chased after me.

01:06:49.701 --> 01:06:51.746
One of them said he
wanted to kill us.

01:06:51.746 --> 01:06:53.748
- Jane, you happened
upon a burglary?

01:06:53.748 --> 01:06:56.969
- No, they were wearing
TV repair outfits,

01:06:56.969 --> 01:06:58.753
and they had guns.

01:06:58.753 --> 01:07:02.061
- No. None of this
makes any sense.

01:07:02.061 --> 01:07:03.149
- I'm not lying.

01:07:03.149 --> 01:07:04.585
- No, I didn't say that
you were lying.

01:07:04.585 --> 01:07:06.152
I just, I know that in
situations like this,

01:07:06.152 --> 01:07:07.893
your mind plays tricks on you.

01:07:07.893 --> 01:07:09.242
Believe me, I know.

01:07:09.242 --> 01:07:10.722
- I'm fine, I'm not like you.

01:07:14.465 --> 01:07:15.640
Let's just keep going.

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.337
- No, listen.

01:07:18.338 --> 01:07:19.731
I'm sorry.

01:07:20.906 --> 01:07:23.169
I'm sorry I'm not more
open and closed.

01:07:25.389 --> 01:07:27.043
I'm sorry that I don't
tell you I love you.

01:07:28.566 --> 01:07:30.133
Because I do.

01:07:32.613 --> 01:07:34.485
I suffer from PTSD.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.273
But that is no excuse, I need
to be stronger than my pain,

01:07:40.273 --> 01:07:42.014
so that I can take care of you.

01:07:42.971 --> 01:07:44.582
- I'm sorry Mom.

01:07:44.582 --> 01:07:46.801
- No, I'm sorry.

01:07:46.801 --> 01:07:47.889
I'm sorry for everything.
[crying]

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.504
I love you.

01:07:53.504 --> 01:07:55.071
- I love you too.

01:07:56.811 --> 01:07:58.813
[sinister music]
[twig snapping]

01:07:58.813 --> 01:08:00.598
[tense music]

01:08:00.598 --> 01:08:02.469
- Go, stay low.

01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:04.776
Quiet.

01:08:07.126 --> 01:08:07.996
[leaves rustling]
[both breathing heavily]

01:08:07.996 --> 01:08:08.780
Stay low.

01:08:10.695 --> 01:08:13.045
[gun clicks]

01:08:20.444 --> 01:08:22.446
Shh.

01:08:37.809 --> 01:08:40.420
[twigs snapping]

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:45.904
[Maggie cries out]
[Maggie thuds to ground]

01:08:45.904 --> 01:08:48.211
[Maggie cries out]

01:08:48.211 --> 01:08:49.341
My ankle, I can't.

01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:50.386
Jane, run!

01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:54.346
[faint sobbing]

01:09:01.006 --> 01:09:02.790
[Wade] Ha ha ha, look
what we have here.

01:09:04.357 --> 01:09:06.837
[Maggie gasps]

01:09:06.837 --> 01:09:09.536
- All right, just
get this over with.

01:09:11.973 --> 01:09:13.801
- Know what?

01:09:13.801 --> 01:09:16.412
I was never much of a gun guy.

01:09:16.412 --> 01:09:19.459
I'm kinda more of a
blade man, myself.

01:09:19.459 --> 01:09:20.939
[knife clinks]

01:09:20.939 --> 01:09:22.158
I'm sorry,

01:09:23.071 --> 01:09:24.551
but it's gonna hurt.

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:30.166
[tense music]

01:09:33.473 --> 01:09:34.604
- Drop it!

01:09:36.389 --> 01:09:37.608
Drop it!

01:09:40.087 --> 01:09:41.828
- You're a pain in the
neck, you know that?

01:09:41.828 --> 01:09:43.179
- Drop it.

01:09:44.876 --> 01:09:47.008
- [laughs] You're not
gonna shoot anybody.

01:09:47.008 --> 01:09:48.095
Come on babe, give me the gun.

01:09:49.488 --> 01:09:51.055
Give me the gun.

01:09:51.055 --> 01:09:52.362
Come on.

01:09:52.362 --> 01:09:53.667
Tell you what, listen.

01:09:53.667 --> 01:09:56.801
Give me the gun, and
you and your mom

01:09:56.801 --> 01:09:59.456
go home, forget this
whole thing ever happened.

01:10:01.632 --> 01:10:03.460
Very simple.

01:10:04.765 --> 01:10:06.071
Give me the gun, look
at you, you're shakin'.

01:10:06.071 --> 01:10:07.725
I mean, you're not
gonna shoot anybody.

01:10:09.335 --> 01:10:10.510
Come on, give me the gun.

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:13.209
- Don't.

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.037
- Give me the gun.

01:10:16.037 --> 01:10:18.257
It's gonna be all right if
you just give me the gun.

01:10:21.521 --> 01:10:22.957
- No.
- What do you say?

01:10:22.957 --> 01:10:24.481
- Don't.
[gun fires]

01:10:24.481 --> 01:10:27.048
[Jane gasps]
- Jane, Jane!

01:10:29.529 --> 01:10:31.009
Give me the gun, go, go.

01:10:32.576 --> 01:10:35.492
[gun thuds]
[Maggie groans]

01:10:35.492 --> 01:10:37.058
Next time, I'll kill you.

01:10:39.409 --> 01:10:41.149
Go!

01:10:44.631 --> 01:10:46.938
- The Qwik Mart's on
the edge of town.

01:10:46.938 --> 01:10:48.592
- Yeah, you wanna know
what's even stranger?

01:10:50.463 --> 01:10:52.596
Is that the Qwik Mart
is where Maggie had

01:10:52.596 --> 01:10:54.250
her last day as a medic.

01:10:55.512 --> 01:10:57.862
She saved some pregnant
woman from a gunman.

01:10:57.862 --> 01:11:00.517
Quit the next day because
she blamed herself

01:11:00.517 --> 01:11:03.041
for not gettin' some other guy.

01:11:05.826 --> 01:11:08.264
- That's too bad.

01:11:09.047 --> 01:11:10.614
- You got it.

01:11:13.486 --> 01:11:14.835
Yeah, we're close.

01:11:16.837 --> 01:11:19.623
[gravel crunches]

01:11:19.623 --> 01:11:20.798
- Whoa, whoa, hey!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:11:20.798 --> 01:11:22.800
- Don't move!

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.497
Don't you even think about it.

01:11:24.497 --> 01:11:27.065
[grunts]

01:11:27.065 --> 01:11:28.196
What'd you do with my partner?

01:11:28.196 --> 01:11:29.633
- He's back there.

01:11:29.633 --> 01:11:31.112
- I guess I'm lone wolf now.

01:11:31.112 --> 01:11:33.680
- No, no, no, don't-- [screams]

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.378
- Get down there!

01:11:35.378 --> 01:11:36.988
[Maggie groans]
Start walkin' slowly.

01:11:53.787 --> 01:11:56.268
[Jason groans]

01:12:02.013 --> 01:12:03.144
- You know what, it looks empty.

01:12:03.144 --> 01:12:03.841
You're starting to bleed again.

01:12:03.841 --> 01:12:05.538
You wait here for me.

01:12:05.538 --> 01:12:06.800
I'll be right back.
[Jason pants]

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.602
[Nelson] Now
don't go anywhere.

01:12:32.957 --> 01:12:34.219
[Victoria] Nelson!

01:12:35.742 --> 01:12:37.396
Hey, guys!

01:12:39.311 --> 01:12:43.315
[phone rings]

01:12:43.315 --> 01:12:44.925
- It's me.
- Wade?

01:12:44.925 --> 01:12:47.319
- No, the other guy.

01:12:47.319 --> 01:12:48.929
- Where's Wade?

01:12:49.626 --> 01:12:51.018
[Nelson] It's just me now.

01:12:51.018 --> 01:12:52.324
- What are you saying?

01:12:52.324 --> 01:12:53.760
- I got the girls.

01:12:54.631 --> 01:12:56.067
I got Jane and Maggie.

01:12:56.067 --> 01:12:57.329
- Where are they?

01:12:58.243 --> 01:13:00.898
- I want 200,000
transferred to my account,

01:13:00.898 --> 01:13:02.943
and an extra 10 grand in cash
for my immediate expenses.

01:13:02.943 --> 01:13:04.031
- What?

01:13:04.031 --> 01:13:06.730
- 200K, and I'll
finish your job.

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:09.080
Judson's Motel in two hours.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.821
Bring the cash, or
I'll call the cops

01:13:10.821 --> 01:13:12.300
and pin everything on you.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.345
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:13:13.345 --> 01:13:14.607
You'll go back to prison.

01:13:14.607 --> 01:13:16.696
- I'll be long gone.

01:13:16.696 --> 01:13:19.307
But the camera system will
be here with two dead girls.

01:13:19.307 --> 01:13:22.310
And their tip to the police
about the receiver's location.

01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:24.661
Two hours.

01:13:24.661 --> 01:13:28.360
- I'll tell them your name!

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.970
- [laughs] You think
Nelson's my real name?

01:13:31.363 --> 01:13:33.931
Now you only got one hour.

01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:35.106
[phone beeps]

01:13:35.106 --> 01:13:36.368
[Jason grunts]

01:13:39.502 --> 01:13:41.895
- No, no, no, don't tell me.

01:13:41.895 --> 01:13:42.896
- They're not here.
- No!

01:13:42.896 --> 01:13:44.028
- Come on, get in the car.

01:13:44.898 --> 01:13:46.465
- No!

01:13:46.465 --> 01:13:48.728
Shit! [gasps]

01:13:48.728 --> 01:13:50.556
What do we do?

01:13:52.558 --> 01:13:53.603
What do we do?

01:13:54.995 --> 01:13:56.519
- We're gonna meet with the PI,

01:13:56.519 --> 01:13:58.346
and find a way to get your
family back, now come on!

01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:00.174
Get in the car!

01:14:00.914 --> 01:14:02.263
[Jason grunts]

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.445
[tense music]
[chair creaking]

01:14:17.975 --> 01:14:19.367
[Jane cries out]

01:14:24.982 --> 01:14:27.201
[chair crashes]

01:14:27.201 --> 01:14:28.638
- Hey there little girl.

01:14:28.638 --> 01:14:30.770
I know what you're up to.

01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:33.904
Let's get you up.
[Jane cries out]

01:14:33.904 --> 01:14:36.689
[Nelson groans]

01:14:36.689 --> 01:14:39.649
Next time you move, I'll
put a bullet in ya head.

01:14:48.919 --> 01:14:51.487
[brakes squeak]

01:14:54.141 --> 01:14:55.839
- I'll be right back I need
to get some cash for the PI.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:59.277
- Thank you, Victoria

01:15:00.452 --> 01:15:02.672
for all you're doing, really.

01:15:02.672 --> 01:15:04.238
- You can thank me later.

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.941
[gentle music]

01:15:19.776 --> 01:15:22.169
[phone dings]

01:15:32.832 --> 01:15:35.487
[sinister music]

01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:46.063
[Jason gasps]

01:15:56.813 --> 01:15:58.815
There it is, thank God I
was afraid I lost my phone.

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.473
Let's go.

01:16:06.039 --> 01:16:09.608
[Jason groans]
[engine revving]

01:16:09.608 --> 01:16:12.263
[sinister music]

01:16:30.673 --> 01:16:34.328
[Maggie screams and whimpers]

01:16:44.817 --> 01:16:47.080
- You wanna know why I
get two rooms?

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.213
Everybody gets popped in hotels.

01:16:49.213 --> 01:16:50.867
No back door.

01:16:52.259 --> 01:16:53.739
But when the dummy
heads show up,

01:16:55.001 --> 01:16:56.481
you simply get in
the room next door

01:16:56.481 --> 01:16:57.830
and act like a
concerned citizen.

01:16:59.397 --> 01:17:01.312
Then you slip away.

01:17:01.312 --> 01:17:02.748
While they search an empty room.

01:17:04.532 --> 01:17:06.883
But if ya really
wanna throw 'em off,

01:17:06.883 --> 01:17:08.711
ya leave behind a dead body.

01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.714
I'll tell you this

01:17:12.802 --> 01:17:14.760
so you do as I say,
or you'll end up dead.

01:17:15.892 --> 01:17:19.547
[Maggie whimpers and screams]

01:17:21.114 --> 01:17:23.421
[rapid gunfire popping]

01:17:23.421 --> 01:17:25.815
[explosions booming]

01:17:25.815 --> 01:17:29.601
[soldier screams out Hey!]

01:17:29.601 --> 01:17:30.733
What's the matter with ya?

01:17:30.733 --> 01:17:32.473
[Maggie whimpers]

01:17:36.869 --> 01:17:39.872
Make a noise, and it's
the last thing you do.

01:17:44.529 --> 01:17:46.096
- It's a panic attack.

01:17:49.186 --> 01:17:50.666
- You're in the stuff, huh?

01:17:53.277 --> 01:17:55.366
My father was a Vet.

01:17:56.497 --> 01:17:58.282
Beat my ass, nearly every day.

01:17:59.196 --> 01:18:00.588
My mother blamed it
on his war dreams.

01:18:02.503 --> 01:18:03.940
That didn't change
nothin' for me.

01:18:05.419 --> 01:18:07.726
I still hated the
son of a witch.

01:18:07.726 --> 01:18:08.771
- Then why?

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.382
Why are you doing this to us?

01:18:12.644 --> 01:18:13.776
- It's not me who
wants to hurt ya.

01:18:17.301 --> 01:18:18.868
- Then who?

01:18:18.868 --> 01:18:20.608
Who!

01:18:20.608 --> 01:18:22.088
- Doesn't matter.

01:18:22.872 --> 01:18:24.656
- No please, no, no-- [whimpers]

01:18:27.093 --> 01:18:29.487
[phone dings]

01:18:35.275 --> 01:18:36.842
- Right on time.

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:42.326
- [Muffled whimpering]
No, no, no! [crying]

01:18:49.028 --> 01:18:51.422
[tense music]

01:19:04.478 --> 01:19:07.307
- I have a confession to make.

01:19:07.307 --> 01:19:09.657
- Yes?

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:16.229
- My husband didn't die
of a heart attack.

01:19:18.536 --> 01:19:21.321
He died on the floor
of a Qwik Mart.

01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:26.022
Because...

01:19:28.372 --> 01:19:34.030
[gasps] I asked him
to pick up a gallon of milk.

01:19:38.251 --> 01:19:40.776
And now he's gone forever.

01:19:44.823 --> 01:19:47.304
[sinister music]

01:19:47.304 --> 01:19:49.523
- What are you, what
are you doing?

01:19:49.523 --> 01:19:51.961
- The last step of my
grief counseling.

01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:55.051
Revenge.

01:19:55.051 --> 01:19:56.443
Now get out of the car.

01:19:57.662 --> 01:19:59.142
- Please--
- Get out of the car!

01:20:03.581 --> 01:20:04.974
- All right.

01:20:04.974 --> 01:20:06.671
- Go!

01:20:08.325 --> 01:20:10.806
[tape tearing]

01:20:12.329 --> 01:20:14.984
[Maggie gasping]

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:27.823
- Come on, this way.

01:20:32.175 --> 01:20:34.003

01:21:20.788 --> 01:21:22.486

Pick which one!
- I pick me!

01:22:58.625 --> 01:23:00.801
I pick me.

01:23:00.801 --> 01:23:02.847

[gun clicks]

01:23:04.153 --> 01:23:05.719
- No, no.

01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:06.982
- I'm not afraid anymore.

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:08.157
- Mom!

01:23:08.157 --> 01:23:10.246
- You took him away from me.

01:23:10.246 --> 01:23:12.378
You took him away from me!

01:23:12.378 --> 01:23:14.337
- Victoria, I wanted
to save your husband.

01:23:16.382 --> 01:23:18.994
I wanted to save him
with every fiber in me.

01:23:20.343 --> 01:23:21.735
I wanted to save him.

01:23:22.562 --> 01:23:23.824
But he told me to leave him.

01:23:23.824 --> 01:23:24.695

01:23:24.695 --> 01:23:26.479
No, no, no, no, you lie!

01:23:26.479 --> 01:23:27.785
- The other woman, she
was pregnant.

01:23:29.134 --> 01:23:30.701
He told me to take her first.

01:23:32.442 --> 01:23:34.009
No he didn't!

01:23:35.793 --> 01:23:38.143
You know it's true, you knew
him better than anyone else.

01:23:39.753 --> 01:23:41.799
Your husband was a hero.

01:23:42.930 --> 01:23:45.977
- [sobbing] I loved him so much.
[sobbing]

01:23:45.977 --> 01:23:49.024
- I know you did.

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:50.503
You need to put the gun down.

01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:53.245
[Victoria sobbing]
You do not wanna do this.

01:23:53.245 --> 01:23:55.421
Don't take my family,
don't take my family.

01:23:57.162 --> 01:23:58.511
[Officer] Come out
with your hands up!

01:23:58.511 --> 01:24:00.557
We have you surrounded!

01:24:00.557 --> 01:24:01.862
- Victoria, listen to me.

01:24:02.994 --> 01:24:04.387
Killing my family

01:24:05.562 --> 01:24:08.347
is not gonna bring him back.

01:24:08.347 --> 01:24:10.262
Put the gun down.
[Victoria sobbing]

01:24:10.262 --> 01:24:11.611
You don't wanna do this.

01:24:17.269 --> 01:24:19.315
[Jason grunting]
[Victoria sobbing]

01:24:23.319 --> 01:24:24.972
I'm so sorry.

01:24:31.544 --> 01:24:33.938
[Officer] This is Unit 27,
we have the suspect in custody.

01:24:40.249 --> 01:24:42.033
[Maggie cries softly]

01:24:42.033 --> 01:24:44.166
- I love you.

01:24:44.166 --> 01:24:45.950
Don't ever do that again.

01:24:47.386 --> 01:24:48.822
- I love you Dad.

01:24:48.822 --> 01:24:51.825
- And I love you Jane.

01:24:51.825 --> 01:24:53.349

01:24:54.872 --> 01:24:56.700
And I love you.

01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.310

I love you guys too.
[static crackling]

01:25:01.661 --> 01:25:03.446
[all laugh]

01:25:03.446 --> 01:25:05.448
You're gonna be fine.

01:25:05.448 --> 01:25:06.927
- Ma'am.

01:25:08.407 --> 01:25:10.888
We found the other guy exactly
where you said he'd be.

01:25:10.888 --> 01:25:13.630
First time I had anyone
thank me for arresting them.

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:15.588
The other guy tried to make a
run out of the bathroom window

01:25:15.588 --> 01:25:17.068
but we got him.

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:22.900
- Hey.

01:25:23.857 --> 01:25:25.729
So I spoke with headquarters,
and congratulations.

01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:27.339
You passed the test.

01:25:27.339 --> 01:25:29.689
All you have to do now is just
a little six week refresher.

01:25:29.689 --> 01:25:31.822
- Yeah.

01:25:32.605 --> 01:25:35.304
I think I'm ready to
get back to work.

01:25:35.304 --> 01:25:36.740
Maybe after a family vacation.

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:37.697
[George laughs]

01:25:37.697 --> 01:25:39.003
I think we need it.

01:25:39.003 --> 01:25:40.570
- Yeah.

01:25:40.570 --> 01:25:42.049
I'll get you all set up, okay?

01:25:42.049 --> 01:25:43.225
- Thank you.

01:25:43.225 --> 01:25:45.009
[George] Whoops, come here.

01:25:45.009 --> 01:25:49.492
[soothing music]

01:25:50.710 --> 01:25:53.191
[gentle music]

01:26:08.772 --> 01:26:11.427
[up-tempo music]
