01:15.625 --> 01:18.916
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please...</i>

01:22.500 --> 01:25.791
between 5 and 10 minutes late...

01:30.083 --> 01:31.583
<i>Train approaching</i>

01:59.166 --> 02:01.208
<i>Door D, terminal 2?</i>

02:01.541 --> 02:03.833
There's no door D in terminal 2.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.333
<i>It's 2 or D.</i>

02:17.208 --> 02:18.333
<i>One new message.</i>

02:19.083 --> 02:20.333
<i>Sonia, it's me.</i>

02:20.583 --> 02:24.291
<i>I met the guy, they don't
hire for those jobs.</i>

02:24.375 --> 02:25.875
<i>It's all outsourced now.</i>

02:27.916 --> 02:30.541
<i>300... 300 and what?</i>

02:30.625 --> 02:34.208
<i>321 or 327, I forget now.</i>

02:34.708 --> 02:39.375
300 and something, plus 370....
<i> Call it 700.</i>

03:02.125 --> 03:06.375
<i>CKE and flight number,
passenger's full name to check in.</i>

03:06.458 --> 03:08.375
<i>F9 for electronic ticket.</i>

03:08.458 --> 03:09.875
<i>F10 to validate.</i>

03:10.125 --> 03:11.791
<i>F4 for boarding pass.</i>

03:11.875 --> 03:13.875
<i>No, shit, bags before F4.</i>

03:13.958 --> 03:16.750
<i>'53 is</i> The Cuban revolution.

03:16.833 --> 03:18.708
No, Batista's coup.

03:19.750 --> 03:21.166
- Sure?
- Positive.

03:21.250 --> 03:22.541
Are you coming?

03:23.875 --> 03:24.916
Go on, come.

03:26.125 --> 03:27.583
Of course I'm angry!

03:28.625 --> 03:32.291
I commit to my commitments.
Now he says he can't make it!

03:50.500 --> 03:53.250
It depends on the
price and everything.

03:55.416 --> 03:57.125
No, I'm going home first.

03:58.583 --> 04:01.458
<i>Fascinated by the world of
beauty and well-being?</i>

04:03.000 --> 04:05.083
<i>One rabbit or one and a half?</i>

04:06.750 --> 04:09.166
No, one nice big rabbit is easier.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.500
<i>One nice big rabbit...</i>

04:11.791 --> 04:13.083
Two slices of bacon...

04:13.166 --> 04:15.166
<i>Sir, dear asshole,</i>

04:15.250 --> 04:20.500
<i>I received your final reminder
to pay bill number xyz...</i>

04:21.208 --> 04:23.416
<i>Thurs ok, Fri no good</i>

04:24.416 --> 04:27.250
<i>As I wrote in my two previous letters...</i>

04:27.333 --> 04:30.333
<i>Shit, the wall's not straight!</i>

04:30.416 --> 04:32.125
<i>Alain? No, not Alain.</i>

04:32.791 --> 04:34.791
<i>Bertrand or something.</i>

04:35.875 --> 04:38.916
<i>It's crazy, I should remember.</i>

04:39.791 --> 04:41.166
<i>407.50, tax included.</i>

04:41.250 --> 04:43.333
<i>50 minutes twice a day, 100 minutes.</i>

04:44.166 --> 04:46.500
<i>6 times a week... 600 minutes.</i>

04:47.250 --> 04:50.541
<i>600 minutes is 10 times 60.
10 hours a week!</i>

04:50.625 --> 04:53.125
Wow, 10 hours commuting each week.

04:53.208 --> 04:54.875
<i>40 hours a month...</i>

06:39.416 --> 06:41.291
Achille, mind the gentleman.

08:47.041 --> 08:48.541
It's just about Aminata.

08:48.791 --> 08:50.333
And she isn't black?

08:50.416 --> 08:52.500
Yes, but she can use deodorant!

08:52.583 --> 08:53.541
What's up?

08:53.625 --> 08:55.375
Aminata got a warning.

08:55.458 --> 08:58.333
It's not that Aminata smells,

08:58.416 --> 09:00.500
but whether she smells nice or not.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.375
So who decides that?

09:02.458 --> 09:04.458
A warning for smelling bad?

09:04.541 --> 09:06.416
"Sloppy presentation".

09:07.375 --> 09:10.458
I have a problem with the
girl you sent yesterday.

09:11.583 --> 09:16.041
She's fine for the common areas but
too disorganized for the rooms.

09:17.375 --> 09:19.625
Can you find me someone fast?

09:23.750 --> 09:25.583
You know they arrive in an hour?

09:31.041 --> 09:32.000
Audrey...

09:33.041 --> 09:34.416
I need you.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.916
Can you do a replacement
Sunday at the usual time?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.833
7 days in a row is a lot

09:39.916 --> 09:43.875
but you can take a day off
when you want, Monday even.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.291
Sorry, but I really can't Sunday.

09:46.791 --> 09:49.333
I have an exam Monday. I need to revise.

09:50.125 --> 09:51.083
All right.

09:58.250 --> 09:59.541
Gone back to uni?

09:59.625 --> 10:01.583
Hey, I'm not their slave.

11:30.041 --> 11:31.000
Hello.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.875
<i>822 - TO BE DONE FIRST</i>

11:53.041 --> 11:54.000
Housekeeping.

14:38.291 --> 14:39.916
8 in the morning.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.291
You speak French?

14:41.625 --> 14:44.833
I understand a bit
but don't speak well.

14:44.916 --> 14:46.375
No, that's very good.

14:54.750 --> 14:57.333
You don't understand, Mr Abelar.

14:57.416 --> 14:59.000
I don't want forecasts,

14:59.333 --> 15:04.416
I want certainties.
The emissions must be managed 100%.

15:04.791 --> 15:06.541
Sorry, I wasn't clear.

15:06.625 --> 15:09.083
Our studies show the new module

15:09.166 --> 15:12.208
makes the whole system compatible.

15:12.291 --> 15:15.291
As it was until Veloce changed the plans.

15:15.375 --> 15:18.125
They weren't changed but perfected.

15:18.791 --> 15:20.750
Why not from the outset?

15:20.833 --> 15:23.291
Bullshit! They're modifications!

15:24.041 --> 15:25.958
We all speak French, right?

15:26.041 --> 15:27.500
Hold on a second...

15:28.791 --> 15:30.000
I'll be clear.

15:31.466 --> 15:34.833
My problem is to deliver an operative
plant to Dubai by December 31.

15:36.208 --> 15:39.250
After that date, penalties apply.

15:39.583 --> 15:43.000
Then my problem will become your problem.

15:43.916 --> 15:46.916
I won't let Cogeted bear the costs

15:47.000 --> 15:49.208
resulting from a
fault in the design

15:49.916 --> 15:51.375
or production.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.500
I won't have the Dubai project

15:54.750 --> 15:56.750
go the same way as Sao Paulo.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.541
So, from the top...

16:00.291 --> 16:02.875
If C-Lab's hypothesis
is confirmed...

16:02.958 --> 16:05.916
Does it affect the whole plan?

16:06.000 --> 16:10.333
Yes. An additional module,
however small, modifies the plans.

16:10.416 --> 16:11.958
How long do you need?

16:12.458 --> 16:15.750
Once it's approved, around 10 days.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.250
And you, Mr. Bayoud?

16:18.125 --> 16:21.125
I need the technical plans
to do the schedule...

16:21.208 --> 16:22.541
"Without the technical plans,

16:22.625 --> 16:24.958
I can't draw out the specifications.

16:25.041 --> 16:26.166
We'll have to stop...

16:31.291 --> 16:34.875
8 to 10 weeks before
computing can be installed.

16:34.958 --> 16:38.083
Then it depends on how
fast Mr. Newman can work.

16:38.166 --> 16:40.291
It depends on Mr. Newman.

19:43.916 --> 19:47.166
Dad, I'm on the bus.
Can you call back in 5 minutes?

20:02.041 --> 20:03.875
I can't hear you.

20:04.875 --> 20:09.291
I saw Thomas' mum the other day.
<i>Heard from him?</i>

20:10.333 --> 20:12.666
Thomas? We're not at the same university.

20:13.750 --> 20:17.208
It's over anyhow, it's all history.

20:18.583 --> 20:20.166
<i>Met someone else?</i>

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Dad...

20:22.500 --> 20:23.333
<i>What?</i>

20:23.958 --> 20:25.500
Don't talk about that.

20:25.750 --> 20:26.791
<i>Why not?</i>

20:26.875 --> 20:28.958
I don't know... It's private.

20:29.458 --> 20:33.416
<i>Surely I can ask if you're ok.
You're not too lonely?</i>

20:33.500 --> 20:36.125
No, the campus is full of students.

20:36.375 --> 20:38.208
<i>How's the job at the hotel?</i>

20:38.291 --> 20:39.500
Fine...

20:40.083 --> 20:41.458
<i>Where were you today?</i>

20:42.083 --> 20:44.333
I was at university all day.

20:48.708 --> 20:50.125
What?

20:50.208 --> 20:51.541
I didn't hear that.

20:53.166 --> 20:56.291
<i>The good thing with the hotel is
you get to use your English.</i>

20:57.333 --> 20:58.333
Who with?

20:58.708 --> 20:59.958
<i>The guests.</i>

21:00.375 --> 21:03.250
You chat to maids in a hotel?

21:03.708 --> 21:06.333
<i>Now and then. Why are you so aggressive?</i>

21:06.416 --> 21:09.333
I'm not aggressive, but
you're being absurd!

26:45.625 --> 26:46.916
Everything ok, sir?

26:47.541 --> 26:48.541
I'm fine.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.458
A cigarette?

27:42.750 --> 27:44.125
Yes. Thank you.

28:00.333 --> 28:03.750
If you need anything,
medication or whatever...

28:03.833 --> 28:05.000
I'm right here.

28:05.708 --> 28:06.625
Thank you.

28:27.750 --> 28:30.000
I don't know the word in French.

28:30.416 --> 28:32.041
We call it "angoisse."

28:32.333 --> 28:33.250
Yes...

30:04.041 --> 30:07.458
Later, Gary Newman would be
unable<i> to pinpoint</i>

30:07.541 --> 30:10.208
the moment when he
made his decision.

30:17.333 --> 30:19.958
<i>Was it really a decision?</i>

30:21.291 --> 30:25.041
<i>Could one speak of choice when the idea,
once sprouted,</i>

30:26.083 --> 30:29.666
<i>had imposed itself on him as being obvious?</i>

30:49.041 --> 30:52.625
<i>Over the following hours,
Gary continued to review</i>

30:52.708 --> 30:55.333
the consequences of
his impending deed.

30:56.166 --> 30:58.333
But nothing made him
change his mind.

30:59.291 --> 31:00.458
<i>On the contrary</i>

31:01.916 --> 31:05.125
<i>as the hours passed,
he was increasingly convinced</i>

31:05.708 --> 31:07.958
<i>there was no other solution.</i>

31:16.875 --> 31:20.583
<i>Good morning, this is your
5:30 wake-up call.</i>

31:32.291 --> 31:34.666
Then, in spite of his tiredness,

31:35.416 --> 31:38.041
he decided to wait until 8 o'clock.

31:38.458 --> 31:43.041
<i>The precise departure time of
the plane he wasn't on.</i>

33:12.083 --> 33:15.041
Gary woke at around
4 in the afternoon

33:15.291 --> 33:17.916
from a sleep troubled
by bad dreams.

33:21.416 --> 33:25.000
<i>After downing some coffee
and half an omelette,</i>

33:25.083 --> 33:29.416
he realized that his flight to
Dubai<i> was about to land.</i>

33:36.166 --> 33:38.583
<i>It was after 5 in Paris,</i>

33:38.666 --> 33:41.166
<i>just past 7 in Dubai.</i>

35:34.875 --> 35:38.250
<i>Gary suddenly felt like he'd
thrown out a hook</i>

35:38.333 --> 35:40.375
<i>and was waiting for a bite.</i>

47:34.000 --> 47:35.666
Camel or Marlboro Light?

47:35.750 --> 47:38.041
Marlboro Light. 3 packs, please.

49:53.500 --> 49:55.083
Have you finished, sir?

49:55.166 --> 49:56.208
Yes. Thank you.

1:06:49.541 --> 1:06:51.250
What are you dreaming about?

1:06:53.541 --> 1:06:55.875
- What?
- What were you dreaming about?

1:06:56.208 --> 1:06:57.541
I don't really know.

1:07:00.375 --> 1:07:02.750
There's a party tomorrow. Want to come?

1:07:02.833 --> 1:07:04.083
Whose party?

1:07:04.166 --> 1:07:07.833
Some student you don't know.
I only just met him.

1:07:12.791 --> 1:07:14.083
Working tomorrow?

1:07:14.166 --> 1:07:16.583
No way. Part-time means part-time.

1:07:19.125 --> 1:07:22.041
Maybe. I'll see after work.

1:07:24.125 --> 1:07:25.916
What?

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:27.916
You say that but I bet you won't come.

1:07:28.125 --> 1:07:29.458
Why wouldn't I?

1:07:39.416 --> 1:07:40.708
I didn't get that.

1:07:42.458 --> 1:07:44.333
Was it in his safe or not?

1:07:44.583 --> 1:07:46.833
<i>No idea. Check with reception.</i>

1:07:47.791 --> 1:07:49.083
<i>But wait.</i>

1:07:49.166 --> 1:07:51.500
<i>With the Tokyo flight late,
it's chaos there.</i>

1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.250
Ok, I'm on it.

1:08:04.250 --> 1:08:05.916
<i>Three, four, five, six...</i>

1:08:07.708 --> 1:08:09.333
<i>...fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.</i>

1:08:10.083 --> 1:08:11.100
<i>Sixteen!</i>

1:08:11.916 --> 1:08:13.208
<i>Shit, sixteen.</i>

1:08:19.125 --> 1:08:20.200
Housekeeping.

1:08:51.333 --> 1:08:54.000
Yes?

1:08:54.083 --> 1:08:55.416
I know it's you.

1:08:59.333 --> 1:09:01.166
What? At the hotel?

1:09:01.250 --> 1:09:03.083
No, I'm at home.

1:09:03.166 --> 1:09:04.958
I mean, in the hallway.

1:09:05.208 --> 1:09:07.583
I did some shopping before leaving.

1:09:09.458 --> 1:09:12.166
In Hamburg? But how...

1:09:15.125 --> 1:09:16.916
Silly...

1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:18.708
What time do you arrive?

1:09:21.750 --> 1:09:23.958
Want me to meet your flight

1:09:24.041 --> 1:09:26.000
or shall I wait in the room?

1:09:31.333 --> 1:09:32.416
Me too.

1:09:38.583 --> 1:09:42.333
It's raining inside me.
I'm wet just thinking of you.

1:09:43.958 --> 1:09:45.083
See you later.

1:10:12.708 --> 1:10:15.000
You have to leave the door open.

1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000
Can you do an extra hour?

1:10:24.416 --> 1:10:25.458
I don't know.

1:10:26.375 --> 1:10:28.041
See Mrs. Baccar about it.

1:10:30.333 --> 1:10:32.375
She isn't here this afternoon.

1:10:33.250 --> 1:10:35.333
I have someone off sick.

1:10:35.666 --> 1:10:37.125
I'm at my wits' end.

1:10:42.666 --> 1:10:44.250
You're saving my life.

1:10:44.625 --> 1:10:47.583
Do 891 and suite 79 at
the end of the building.

1:10:48.666 --> 1:10:51.208
Do it last, we don't need it today.

1:10:54.083 --> 1:10:55.875
No need to overdo it.

1:10:56.708 --> 1:10:58.708
You'll never finish otherwise.

1:11:03.125 --> 1:11:04.166
<i>Bitch!</i>

1:11:08.041 --> 1:11:10.166
I shouldn't make the bed?

1:11:30.041 --> 1:11:31.916
<i>817 - DEPARTING</i>

1:11:37.916 --> 1:11:38.933
Housekeeping.

1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:18.333
Everything ok, sir?

1:12:29.083 --> 1:12:30.750
There's someone in 817.

1:12:31.041 --> 1:12:33.125
<i>What?</i>

1:12:33.208 --> 1:12:35.783
It says "departing"
but the guest's here, asleep.

1:12:36.166 --> 1:12:37.333
<i>Where are you?</i>

1:12:37.916 --> 1:12:39.000
809.

1:12:39.375 --> 1:12:41.041
<i>Hold on, I'll ask.</i>

1:13:14.375 --> 1:13:15.583
<i>Audrey?</i>

1:13:16.500 --> 1:13:18.833
<i>You're right about 817.</i>

1:13:18.958 --> 1:13:22.666
<i>Reception forgot to note a
last-minute change.</i>

1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:25.958
<i>Do the room anyway.</i>

1:13:26.041 --> 1:13:28.625
<i>The guest said he'll be
going out in an hour.</i>

1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.958
<i>Isn't it the 18th today?</i>

1:15:11.708 --> 1:15:13.625
<i>Yes, he should be in Dubai.</i>

1:17:59.083 --> 1:18:00.041
Housekeeping!

1:19:23.666 --> 1:19:25.750
Ok, I'm sick of this now.

1:19:27.041 --> 1:19:27.916
Shit...

1:19:35.583 --> 1:19:36.791
Is someone there?

1:19:49.291 --> 1:19:50.833
What's going on?

1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:50.458
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

1:22:18.541 --> 1:22:19.666
<i>It's wild!</i>

1:22:23.750 --> 1:22:25.500
<i>What do I do now?</i>

1:23:22.083 --> 1:23:23.041
<i>Right...</i>

1:23:23.750 --> 1:23:25.250
Since when?

1:23:25.333 --> 1:23:26.333
3 weeks now.

1:23:27.041 --> 1:23:28.625
It's driving me crazy.

1:23:29.166 --> 1:23:30.500
<i>Cripes!</i>

1:23:30.583 --> 1:23:33.383
I work here till 3 am then
get up at 8 to visit flats.

1:23:34.458 --> 1:23:35.458
It's hopeless.

1:23:36.166 --> 1:23:37.666
Even with a steady job?

1:23:39.708 --> 1:23:43.625
The trouble is, I was subletting before.

1:23:44.166 --> 1:23:46.166
And no one can vouch for me.

1:23:47.166 --> 1:23:48.458
Where do you sleep?

1:23:49.458 --> 1:23:51.291
On a friend's couch.

1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:55.875
Half my stuff is in his garage,
half at a pal's in Rouen.

1:23:56.708 --> 1:23:58.083
It's a mess.

1:24:00.291 --> 1:24:02.916
Can't you stay at
your new girlfriend's?

1:24:03.875 --> 1:24:06.166
No, we're not there yet.

1:24:06.625 --> 1:24:07.875
She doesn't know.

1:24:08.125 --> 1:24:09.750
Why haven't you told her?

1:24:11.500 --> 1:24:14.458
We just met. I can't tell
her I don't have a place.

1:24:15.708 --> 1:24:17.083
It's awkward.

1:24:18.916 --> 1:24:20.458
Where do you see each other?

1:24:21.458 --> 1:24:23.166
How do you manage to...

1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:26.458
We don't for now.

1:24:28.583 --> 1:24:31.500
But that's ok. There's no...

1:24:33.916 --> 1:24:35.208
I'll find something.

1:24:35.625 --> 1:24:36.666
I will.

1:24:42.500 --> 1:24:43.708
Gotta get back.

1:24:45.625 --> 1:24:46.666
Do I know you?

1:24:47.250 --> 1:24:48.083
What?

1:24:49.166 --> 1:24:51.150
That sparrow... It was staring at us.

1:24:51.541 --> 1:24:52.541
What sparrow?

1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:54.083
It's gone now.

1:24:54.500 --> 1:24:55.575
Back to work.

1:25:13.791 --> 1:25:16.041
<i>This works really well!</i>

1:25:17.875 --> 1:25:19.250
<i>Right...</i>

1:25:19.333 --> 1:25:20.875
<i>Let's practice now.</i>

1:25:36.916 --> 1:25:39.541
<i>Follow the line.</i>

1:25:40.666 --> 1:25:41.916
<i>And off we go!</i>

1:25:44.333 --> 1:25:45.666
<i>Right turn...</i>

1:25:47.166 --> 1:25:49.000
<i>Up we go...</i>

1:25:51.541 --> 1:25:53.166
<i>And we land!</i>

1:25:54.500 --> 1:25:57.500
Ok, the wind's the toughest part.

1:26:47.083 --> 1:26:48.666
<i>Batman!</i>

1:28:16.125 --> 1:28:17.208
<i>Biarritz...</i>

1:28:18.458 --> 1:28:19.750
<i>San Sebastian...</i>

1:28:27.208 --> 1:28:28.333
<i>Perpignan...</i>

1:28:29.625 --> 1:28:31.500
<i>Why would he go to Perpignan?</i>

1:28:57.125 --> 1:28:58.750
Let's go.

1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:32.458
<i>Faster! Faster!</i>

1:31:41.125 --> 1:31:42.708
It's fantastic.

1:31:42.791 --> 1:31:45.750
There's nothing there.
If you have a project,

1:31:46.458 --> 1:31:47.708
you file it...

1:31:48.291 --> 1:31:49.916
I never thought of it.

1:31:50.291 --> 1:31:52.250
You've no idea how mad she is...

1:31:53.416 --> 1:31:56.041
We're in for a great weekend.

1:32:27.541 --> 1:32:29.166
Charlotte!

1:33:03.625 --> 1:33:04.583
Call.

1:33:05.583 --> 1:33:07.208
Check.

1:33:08.125 --> 1:33:09.583
300.

1:33:09.666 --> 1:33:10.725
Plus 600.

1:33:15.333 --> 1:33:16.458
Get lost!

1:33:49.458 --> 1:33:50.833
<i>Is that him?</i>

1:33:50.916 --> 1:33:52.250
<i>The sleeping man?</i>

1:35:42.375 --> 1:35:44.416
Welcome to a world of opportunity

1:36:37.916 --> 1:36:40.041
All right, time to change back.

1:36:46.541 --> 1:36:48.291
<i>1, 2,</i>

1:36:48.375 --> 1:36:49.250
<i>3...</i>

1:36:49.333 --> 1:36:50.375
<i>Here goes!</i>

1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:56.250
<i>No flying. Walk!</i>

1:37:05.916 --> 1:37:07.083
<i>It's not working.</i>

1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:11.083
<i>How does it go in fairy tales?</i>

1:37:12.375 --> 1:37:13.708
<i>Shit, I'm hungry!</i>

1:37:18.166 --> 1:37:20.750
<i>I need to eat or I'll faint.</i>

1:37:27.333 --> 1:37:28.500
<i>I'm hungry!</i>

1:37:52.916 --> 1:37:54.666
<i>Everything's weird.</i>

1:38:06.916 --> 1:38:07.750
<i>Bingo!</i>

1:39:01.708 --> 1:39:02.666
<i>No!</i>

1:39:19.833 --> 1:39:21.708
<i>Stop now! Calm down!</i>

1:39:22.541 --> 1:39:23.541
<i>Calm down.</i>

1:39:24.500 --> 1:39:25.500
<i>Breathe...</i>

1:39:25.958 --> 1:39:26.916
<i>Breathe.</i>

1:39:27.958 --> 1:39:28.958
<i>Breathe.</i>

1:39:38.291 --> 1:39:39.375
<i>Right...</i>

1:39:49.083 --> 1:39:50.666
<i>Where's he gone this late?</i>

1:39:55.416 --> 1:39:56.750
<i>To buy cigarettes?</i>

1:39:58.625 --> 1:39:59.791
<i>To have a drink?</i>

1:40:01.125 --> 1:40:02.183
<i>What's this?</i>

1:40:13.875 --> 1:40:17.458
<i>...in the future, should the land
be sold to the Chinese?</i>

1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:52.750
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

1:46:33.333 --> 1:46:34.583
<i>Who's that?</i>

1:46:35.375 --> 1:46:36.708
When do you start?

1:46:36.791 --> 1:46:37.791
6 pm.

1:46:39.916 --> 1:46:41.875
- See you tomorrow, Simon.
- Bye.

1:46:42.625 --> 1:46:43.583
<i>Simon?</i>

1:46:47.750 --> 1:46:48.875
<i>Right, Simon!</i>

1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:02.625
<i>What's that?</i>

1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:40.125
<i>A human!</i>

1:57:53.875 --> 1:57:54.875
Miss...

1:57:58.208 --> 1:57:59.250
Miss...

1:58:03.875 --> 1:58:05.125
You're here.

1:58:05.875 --> 1:58:06.750
What?

1:58:14.041 --> 1:58:15.125
Miss...

1:58:15.833 --> 1:58:17.125
Can you hear me?

1:58:22.666 --> 1:58:23.916
You can see me?

1:58:24.333 --> 1:58:25.250
Sorry?

1:58:33.458 --> 1:58:34.583
You can see me?

1:58:36.500 --> 1:58:37.958
Yes, I can see you.

1:58:39.041 --> 1:58:40.500
Can you walk?

1:58:46.541 --> 1:58:48.250
You can phone.

1:58:50.458 --> 1:58:51.500
Miss!

1:59:05.791 --> 1:59:06.916
The window.

1:59:08.333 --> 1:59:09.750
Sorry?

1:59:09.833 --> 1:59:11.541
Open the window, please.

2:01:34.583 --> 2:01:35.708
Where to?

2:01:35.958 --> 2:01:37.000
Ground floor.

2:01:44.416 --> 2:01:46.791
You've lost your shoes.

2:01:51.583 --> 2:01:53.000
"Cendrillon" in French!

2:01:54.041 --> 2:01:55.208
Yes.

2:02:11.208 --> 2:02:12.125
"Person?"

2:02:12.541 --> 2:02:13.500
Yes,

2:02:25.500 --> 2:02:28.541
We're "persons" too...

2:02:32.416 --> 2:02:33.625
That's weird.

2:02:37.416 --> 2:02:39.000
You're right, it's weird.

2:02:39.541 --> 2:02:41.625
One word, opposite meanings.

2:02:47.500 --> 2:02:50.541
What's the opposite
of the opposite?

2:02:52.333 --> 2:02:54.333
In French, you mean?

2:02:54.416 --> 2:02:56.833
Yes.

2:02:56.916 --> 2:02:58.000
I don't know.

2:03:00.291 --> 2:03:01.458
"Pareil," the same.

2:03:02.791 --> 2:03:05.416
Or "identique," identical or
"semblable," similar.

2:03:06.208 --> 2:03:07.125
"Pareil?"

2:03:14.250 --> 2:03:15.375
Goodbye then.

2:03:16.958 --> 2:03:18.750
Good luck for your trip.

2:03:19.250 --> 2:03:20.250
Thank you.

2:03:20.333 --> 2:03:22.041
Good luck for you.

2:03:38.958 --> 2:03:40.583
Sir!

2:03:45.541 --> 2:03:48.708
Excuse me, but what's your name?

2:03:52.125 --> 2:03:53.083
And yours?

2:03:54.750 --> 2:03:55.791
Audrey.

2:03:56.791 --> 2:03:58.208
Audrey Camuzet.

2:03:59.083 --> 2:04:00.625
Nice to meet you, Audrey.
