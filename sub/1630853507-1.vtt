[theme music]

00:10.360 --> 00:12.320
David, it's me. Call me back.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.880
Grace Harper is under
police protection.

00:15.040 --> 00:17.120
I think someone's outside.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.520
I'm frightened.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.320
Grace, I got your message.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.960
I can't get away right now.

00:23.120 --> 00:26.000
[David]But I'll send round
someone you can trust.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.680
Don't worry.

00:30.480 --> 00:31.720
So, you want me to go round
there?

00:31.880 --> 00:33.120
Please.

00:34.560 --> 00:37.880
Detective Constable Rob Brady.
Grace?

00:42.840 --> 00:43.920
Rob?

00:44.920 --> 00:46.480
Grace Harper's dead.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.840
[tense music]

00:56.760 --> 00:59.160
[suspenseful music]

01:26.480 --> 01:29.160
[music continues]

[tap]

01:50.960 --> 01:53.200
[panting]

02:05.640 --> 02:08.120
Step back. Give me some room
here. You.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.160
[pants]

02:09.320 --> 02:10.200
Call the police.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.240
[intense music]

02:29.200 --> 02:31.880
[indistinct radio chatter]

02:35.560 --> 02:38.440
[suspenseful music]

02:55.200 --> 02:56.440
No Rob?

02:58.280 --> 03:00.280
No, but we have got a stand in.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.320
Again?

03:04.240 --> 03:05.880
Rob called me earlier.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.440
They had a bad night
with the baby,

03:07.600 --> 03:09.240
so he's dropping the twins
at day care.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.800
You're the boss.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.440
So, what have we got?

03:14.600 --> 03:16.560
Looks like a painter
and decorator.

03:16.720 --> 03:19.080
Luckily, we've got an ID
thanks to his driving license,

03:19.240 --> 03:20.520
Harry Steadman.

03:20.680 --> 03:22.760
Someone stuck a screwdriver
in him.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.080
Nice.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.960
Off duty uniformed officer was
first on the scene.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.400
I'm just gonna get his account.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.440
[tense music]

03:40.640 --> 03:42.720
I was, um, I was
on my way to work

03:42.880 --> 03:45.120
and I spotted him driving
erratically.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.360
So, you pulled him over?

03:46.520 --> 03:48.240
No, the-the van ground to
a halt.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.320
By the time I could get to him
it was too late.

03:51.480 --> 03:54.800
Is there anything else, sir?
It's just I'm on duty soon.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.480
We'll need your clothes.

03:56.640 --> 03:59.480
Oh! I've got a-a spare uniform
in my locker.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.200
Can I bag these up and drop 'em
over to you then?

04:01.360 --> 04:03.400
I could give a full statement
then.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.480
Of course. Thanks for your help,
sergeant.

04:05.640 --> 04:06.920
Oh, anytime.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.680
[phone vibrates]

04:13.840 --> 04:16.760
Sarge? Yeah, I'm leaving
my house now.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.000
I'm dropping the twins
at day care.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.280
Come on girls, that's it.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.760
Come on, careful, be careful.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.960
Yeah, I thought I'd meet you
back at base.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.080
It'll all be over by the time
I get to the crime scene.

04:28.240 --> 04:31.040
No, actually, Rob, I'd like you
to see this.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.120
[baby crying]

04:33.280 --> 04:34.400
Yeah.

04:34.560 --> 04:37.040
Come on then, let's go.
Quick.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.920
Quickly, that's it.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.000
[suspenseful music]

04:51.040 --> 04:52.640
The victim looks like he's been
in a fight.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.080
But the cause of death
is clearly

04:54.240 --> 04:56.360
the stab wound in the abdomen.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.040
Presumably, he pulled
the screwdriver out

04:58.200 --> 05:00.600
and bled to death on the way
to hospital.

05:00.760 --> 05:03.640
Another five minutes and he
would have made it.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.600
The driving license
has given us an address.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.080
A pub, The Rose and Crown.

05:08.240 --> 05:11.040
The Rose and Crown?
Whereabouts?

05:11.200 --> 05:12.440
Poplar.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.600
Vivienne, can I have a word?

05:19.160 --> 05:20.400
Something I said?

05:21.240 --> 05:22.480
Who knows?

05:26.040 --> 05:27.920
Do you remember Grace Harper?

05:28.080 --> 05:30.320
She was in witness protection,
I was her handler.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.360
Of course, I remember. She was
murdered, Rob found her body.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.760
She lived at the Rose and Crown.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.680
So, who's this guy?

05:38.840 --> 05:42.240
Grace's long term boyfriend was
Doug Steadman, the landlord.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.720
Presumably, Harry Steadman's
his brother.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.520
I don't want Rob anywhere
near this.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.400
Uh, the detective inspector
and I are gonna

05:54.560 --> 05:56.360
go and do the death knock.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.880
Any particular reason why?

05:59.040 --> 06:00.920
That pub's got a reputation.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.280
Let's just say you two might
not be welcome there.

06:03.440 --> 06:04.440
You're joking?

06:04.600 --> 06:05.640
No one likes pandering

06:05.800 --> 06:07.600
to racists, Rob,

06:07.760 --> 06:10.040
but we have to be sensitive
to the situation.

06:14.680 --> 06:16.840
I was beginning to wonder,
if you'd noticed.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.080
What?

06:18.240 --> 06:19.960
That Rob's checked out
of the job.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.120
-Oh, that's not fair.
-What?

06:22.280 --> 06:23.760
He didn't wanna come to
the crime scene this morning.

06:23.920 --> 06:24.960
What's that about?

06:25.120 --> 06:26.600
He's got a new baby.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.600
[sighs]

06:29.760 --> 06:31.680
I think he's lost his bottle.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.120
-Why?
-I don't know.

06:34.280 --> 06:36.600
All I do know is, he started to

06:36.760 --> 06:39.840
go off the rails after he found
Grace Harper's body.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.440
It hit him really hard.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.280
[dramatic music]

07:27.040 --> 07:29.600
[laughing]

07:29.760 --> 07:32.000
You sure you're in
the right place, darling?

07:32.160 --> 07:35.440
Ah, do you know a Harry
Steadman?

07:35.600 --> 07:37.120
Yeah, I'm his brother.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.240
What's up? Is Harry alright?

07:40.400 --> 07:42.200
I'm Detective Sergeant
Vivienne Cole.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.920
Detective Inspector David
Bradford.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.880
Is there somewhere we can talk?

07:46.040 --> 07:47.960
Somewhere a little more private?

07:48.840 --> 07:50.040
Yeah.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.520
Go on then. Spit it out.

08:02.680 --> 08:05.080
I'm sorry to have to tell you
that your brother Harry

08:05.240 --> 08:06.600
was found dead this morning.

08:09.680 --> 08:10.920
He was what?

08:11.080 --> 08:13.040
Mr. Steadman, your brother was
stabbed

08:13.200 --> 08:15.880
with a screwdriver. This is
being treated as murder.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.960
What?

08:21.120 --> 08:22.280
You okay?

08:23.840 --> 08:25.480
It's a mistake.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.720
We haven't made a formal
identification

08:27.880 --> 08:30.160
but your brother was found in
a yellow van,

08:30.320 --> 08:34.920
registration F-T-0-7-S-W-Z.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.280
Yeah.

08:36.440 --> 08:37.960
Our assumption is that
he was trying to

08:38.120 --> 08:39.560
make it to the hospital.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.200
Mr. Steadman,
do you have any idea

08:43.360 --> 08:45.320
who might have done this
to your brother?

08:47.280 --> 08:49.080
Everybody loved Harry.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.680
He was special.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.720
Did you know that? Did you know
that Harry was special?

08:58.400 --> 09:00.840
[suspenseful music]

09:09.800 --> 09:11.600
Thanks.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.520
Our victim's brother,
Doug Steadman,

09:13.680 --> 09:15.880
has a criminal record.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.000
Caution for assault,
a minor ABH,

09:18.160 --> 09:21.400
then six months prison for
a racially aggravated assault.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.760
-What about Harry?
-No criminal record.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.280
The system shows
he was a victim of assault

09:26.440 --> 09:28.920
two years ago when he was
still at school.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.800
-Who assaulted him?
-Two teenage girls.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.000
Sounds like they'd been
bullying him for a while.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.880
Bullying him?

09:36.040 --> 09:38.320
The report flags him as
vulnerable.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.160
He had learning difficulties.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.760
Oh.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.880
Our Harry hated school.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.440
Waste of time him being there.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.120
But he held down a job
as a painter and decorator?

09:55.280 --> 09:56.520
Had his own business.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.920
No good with the admin,

09:58.080 --> 09:59.920
but Harry was a demon
with a paintbrush.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.760
So, who looks after the books?

10:01.920 --> 10:05.440
My missus.
Or...at least she did.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.840
-Not anymore?
-No.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.200
-Why not?
-She died.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.840
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.360
I'm not.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.720
We weren't together
when it happened.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.160
Can I ask you, Mr. Steadman,

10:21.320 --> 10:23.440
where were you between
8:00 and 9:00 this morning?

10:25.360 --> 10:26.680
Am I some sort of suspect?

10:26.840 --> 10:29.960
We just need to know
for elimination purposes.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.480
I was here. Taking a delivery.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.880
Ask the brewery,
if you don't believe me.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.760
Do you have a child living
with you?

10:40.920 --> 10:43.880
Yeah, my little lad, Rocky.
He's at nursery.

10:44.040 --> 10:47.680
So, it was just you, Harry
and Rocky living here?

10:47.840 --> 10:49.560
That's right.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.840
Your ex who died,
was that Rocky's mum?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.080
Yeah.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.040
-What was her name?
-Grace.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.640
How did she die?

10:58.920 --> 11:01.280
What's this got to do
with Harry?

11:01.440 --> 11:03.600
-It could be relevant.
-It ain't.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.520
Is it okay if we take a look
at Harry's room?

11:10.800 --> 11:12.560
Yeah.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.160
[suspenseful music]

11:17.520 --> 11:19.560
[Doug]Never grew up
my baby brother.

11:22.520 --> 11:25.520
Uh, we didn't find a phone
on Harry.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.840
That's weird, he was glued
to that thing.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.520
[keypad clacking]

11:29.680 --> 11:31.800
-What are you doing?
-Giving it a ring.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.480
[phone rings]

11:44.440 --> 11:46.480
[continues ringing]

11:50.880 --> 11:52.800
Gone to voicemail.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.400
I can't believe he's dead.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.800
Where did you find Harry?

12:12.480 --> 12:13.760
Rotherhithe.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.040
And who found him?

12:16.520 --> 12:20.360
An off duty police officer,
as it happens.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.080
[suspenseful music]

13:03.800 --> 13:05.760
So, what happened
with Grace Harper?

13:05.920 --> 13:07.240
Do you know why she was
murdered?

13:07.400 --> 13:08.640
It's not my investigation.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.120
Rob and I were told to stay away
from the case.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.040
Well, you must have an opinion?

13:13.200 --> 13:14.680
[sighs]

13:14.840 --> 13:17.120
Grace was killed to stop her
from talking.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.360
She was about to blow
the whistle on something big.

13:19.520 --> 13:20.680
Can I ask what?

13:21.760 --> 13:22.960
You can ask.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.680
[dramatic music]

13:35.960 --> 13:38.640
I might know where Harry
Steadman was attacked.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.640
How come?

13:39.800 --> 13:40.960
I found this delivery note

13:41.120 --> 13:42.240
in the glove box of his van.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.360
It's for paint delivered
to a Mrs. Hart

13:44.520 --> 13:47.160
at an address in Peckham
a couple of days ago.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.760
You think he could be working
there this morning?

13:48.920 --> 13:51.760
It's possible.
Do you wanna check it out?

13:51.920 --> 13:53.960
It's a long shot.
We could send local uniform.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.280
Up to you.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.440
Okay.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.040
Oh, before you go.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.040
My mum got this.
It's for the baby.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.000
It's only from the market.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.120
That's great.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.920
Tell her I said thanks.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.600

Control requesting backup.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.400

14:59.080 --> 15:02.440
Insecure premises with blood
trail outside.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.240
Possible suspects in premises.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.240

15:08.200 --> 15:09.840
Police, anybody here?

15:35.160 --> 15:37.160
Billie.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.480
I'm pretty sure this is
the crime scene.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.080
Yeah, can you let the sarge
know...

15:41.240 --> 15:45.520
and send a SOCO team
down here asap? Thanks.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.120
[Samira] Harry?
Is everything alright?

15:48.280 --> 15:49.760
Stay there. Don't touch
anything.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.520
This is my house.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.960
I'm Detective Constable
Rob Brady. Are you Mrs. Hart?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.480
Yeah, the neighbour called
and said the door's wide open.

15:55.640 --> 15:58.080
-What's going on?
-Let's do this outside.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.760
[suspenseful music]

16:12.440 --> 16:13.640
Do you know a Harry Steadman?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.840
He's painting the hall
and the stairs.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.440
I saw blood, has he had
an accident?

16:17.600 --> 16:19.880
I'm sorry to tell you
that Harry Steadman's dead.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.880
Harry's dead?

16:25.040 --> 16:26.120
How? What happened?

16:26.280 --> 16:28.480
We believe he's been murdered.

16:28.640 --> 16:29.920
In my house?

16:30.080 --> 16:31.360
Is he lying dead in my house?

16:31.520 --> 16:33.400
No, he was in his van,
miles away from here.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.400
Why didn't you say that before?

16:52.600 --> 16:55.920
I picked up Harry's phone
by mistake.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.000
I'll tell you where mine is,
some detective's got it.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.240
Well, I don't know. That's what
I need you to find out.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.600
He's mixed race.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.960
[tense music]

17:25.600 --> 17:27.880
That photograph of Grace
in Harry's bedroom,

17:28.040 --> 17:30.120
they were obviously very close.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.920
He must have been devastated,
when she was killed.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.880
So, I'm presuming that Grace

17:35.040 --> 17:38.360
was in possession
of evidence of a crime.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.240
A serious crime.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.240
That's a reasonable presumption.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.320
So, what if Harry knew
what Grace knew?

17:45.480 --> 17:47.960
What? And that's why he's been
killed?

17:48.120 --> 17:49.960
The thought had crossed my mind.

17:50.120 --> 17:53.040
[suspenseful music]

18:05.640 --> 18:07.640
He was a lovely boy.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.640
Gentle. Not the brightest,
but sweet.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.640
So, how'd you know Harry?

18:12.800 --> 18:16.840
He was recommended, I think
it was a mate of my husband's.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.120
When did you leave the house
this morning?

18:19.280 --> 18:20.720
Before eight.
I took the kids to school

18:20.880 --> 18:22.600
and then called into the
restaurant on the way home.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.040
-Restaurant?
-Yeah.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.480
It's how I make a living,
me and Josh,

18:25.640 --> 18:29.040
we opened an organic restaurant
by the river.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.920
Do you recognize this?

18:32.080 --> 18:34.440
It's none of the family's.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.880
Could it be Harry's?

18:37.040 --> 18:39.400
[sighs] It could be,
I really don't know.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.440
Excuse me a moment.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.640
[sighs]

18:56.600 --> 19:00.120
It's me. Harry's dead,
the police are here.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.640
Call me back.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.240
Trying to get hold of my
husband. Voicemail.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.000
I need you to take
a look at this.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.880
We suspect it's cannabis.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.400
Have you seen it before?

19:13.560 --> 19:16.320
Of course not.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.320
We've got children in the house.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.960
-Where did you find it?
-In Harry's toolbox.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.240
And there's far more here
than anyone would

19:23.400 --> 19:25.040
need for personal use.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.640
-You mean he's dealing drugs?
-Do you think that's possible?

19:27.800 --> 19:30.200
I find it very hard to believe.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.040
Harry was so innocent.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.680
[suspenseful music]

19:40.880 --> 19:44.080
I've found two other deaths
associated with that pub.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.920
Two?

19:47.080 --> 19:49.000
You'd better bring us
up to speed.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.920
This is Police Constable
Tyler Bates.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.680
You won't have forgotten
that he was stabbed to death

19:59.840 --> 20:01.200
just under a year ago.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.080
He was in uniform on patrol.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.400
The murder took place
less than 50 meters

20:06.560 --> 20:07.840
from the Rose and Crown.

20:09.880 --> 20:13.480
Uh, were Doug or Harry Steadman
ever suspects?

20:13.640 --> 20:16.160
They were spoken to as
witnesses, never arrested.

20:16.320 --> 20:20.320
But Doug's girlfriend
called 999 that night.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.600
Which is surprising, given that
Doug is a well-known racist.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.680
So, you think
that the girlfriend

20:27.840 --> 20:29.840
went out on
a limb calling an ambulance?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.960
For a black guy? Definitely.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.360
I've tried to track her down.

20:34.520 --> 20:37.280
Turns out Grace Harper
is dead too.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.480
I'm trying to find out
how she died,

20:40.640 --> 20:42.840
but her murder investigation
is locked down and

20:43.000 --> 20:44.920
I don't have the permissions
to access it.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.920
No, I can take care of that.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.800
I want you to concentrate on
what's happened today,

20:48.960 --> 20:50.400
Harry Steadman's murder.

20:50.560 --> 20:51.680
Do me a favour, Billie,

20:51.840 --> 20:53.520
don't mention Grace Harper
to Rob.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.080
Why?

20:55.240 --> 20:57.080
Do you know what?
Don't see it as a favour.

20:57.240 --> 21:00.880
Look on it as a direct order
from a senior office, okay?

21:01.040 --> 21:02.240
Yeah.

21:05.240 --> 21:06.440
[whispers]
Sorry.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.840
Can I help you?

21:18.280 --> 21:20.080
Grace Harper knew who killed

21:20.240 --> 21:21.480
that police officer,
Tyler Bates.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.200
That's why she was
in witness protection.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.760
You know I can't confirm
or deny that.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.160
You don't need to.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.680
The question is,
where was Harry Steadman

21:29.840 --> 21:31.920
the night that PC Bates
was murdered on duty?

21:32.080 --> 21:33.880
Did he see what happened?

21:34.040 --> 21:35.840
You think that's why he was
killed this morning?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.240
To shut him up as well?

21:37.400 --> 21:39.520
Well, what other reason
is there to,

21:39.680 --> 21:42.040
to murder a harmless boy
like Harry Steadman?

21:43.800 --> 21:46.040
You and Rob must know
how Grace Harper was killed.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.800
She was stabbed.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.480
-What's that?
-A phone.

21:54.640 --> 21:55.680
Found it at the crime scene.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.120
-Our victim's?
-Could be.

21:58.280 --> 22:01.720
I'm gonna take it to the lab,
see if they can fast track it.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.480
We might not need it.

22:03.640 --> 22:06.000
I've just got access to
Harry Steadman's phone records.

22:06.160 --> 22:08.080
[tense music]

22:13.640 --> 22:15.840
[Billie]Harry Steadman was
constantly exchanging texts

22:16.000 --> 22:17.520
with the same number.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.240
Do we know who the number
belongs to?

22:19.400 --> 22:21.680
It's a pay as you go, so there's
no subscriber details.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.800
But we ran a quick cell site,

22:23.960 --> 22:26.040
and it's been frequently located

22:26.200 --> 22:30.160
at the restaurant
owned by Josh Hart.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.160
Samira Hart's husband.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.360
Given that Harry Steadman
was so vulnerable,

22:34.520 --> 22:37.160
and the amount of cannabis
SOCO's found in his toolbox,

22:37.320 --> 22:40.640
we wonder if Josh Hart was
using Harry as a courier?

22:40.800 --> 22:43.160
Especially, as Josh Hart
has been cautioned

22:43.320 --> 22:44.720
twice for possession
of cannabis.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.760
Did you ask Samira about the
drugs found in the toolbox?

22:47.920 --> 22:51.040
Of course, but she was all
butter wouldn't melt.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.760
Track the pair of them down.
Speak to her again.

22:57.480 --> 23:00.840
So, Harry Steadman might have
been stabbed in a drugs dispute?

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
And his connection to Grace
Harper's just a coincidence?

23:04.160 --> 23:05.840
I don't believe in coincidences.

23:07.440 --> 23:08.800
Neither do you.

23:11.080 --> 23:13.960
[suspenseful music]

23:29.280 --> 23:30.720
Get in.

23:43.440 --> 23:46.000
[suspenseful music]

23:50.000 --> 23:51.520
What the hell happened?

23:55.320 --> 23:56.800
Harry went crazy.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.960
He came at me
with a screwdriver.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.440
I should never have told you
where he was.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.120
Didn't have a choice.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.960
He was gonna blow the whistle.

24:08.640 --> 24:09.920
What happened with your brother
this morning,

24:10.080 --> 24:12.880
it was an accident. I swear it.

24:13.040 --> 24:16.400
I only went over there to
talk to him, but...

24:16.560 --> 24:18.960
Harry attacked me.

24:19.120 --> 24:21.520
I could see he was hurt, I...

24:21.680 --> 24:23.640
offered to drive him to A&E
but he wouldn't listen.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.480
I mean, you know
what Harry's like.

24:28.520 --> 24:30.560
I followed the van, I just...

24:32.720 --> 24:34.920
I was desperate to help
but by the time I got there...

24:36.880 --> 24:38.600
-It was too late.
-Why didn't you call me?

24:38.760 --> 24:39.880
I lost my phone. I was...

24:40.040 --> 24:41.840
I was just on my
way to get another one.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.600
He was my kid brother.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.240
This is all down to Grace.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.320
She poisoned Harry's mind,
she turned him against us.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.480
Grace is dead
because you killed her.

24:52.640 --> 24:55.280
Because she was a grass,
she was a...

24:55.440 --> 24:57.320
she was a police informant.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.480
She was determined to see
me and you,

24:59.640 --> 25:02.040
the father of her kid,
banged up in prison.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.480
Remind me what she said to you
the last time she called you.

25:05.640 --> 25:06.840
Hm?

25:08.800 --> 25:11.000
She said there was nothing I
could do to change her mind.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.200
That woman,

25:15.640 --> 25:17.600
she got under
your brother's skin.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.400
This morning, all he kept
saying was...

25:21.560 --> 25:23.200
he had to go to the police.

25:25.080 --> 25:28.440
Well I'm sorry Doug, I really
am, but if anyone is to blame

25:28.600 --> 25:30.320
for Harry's death,

25:31.840 --> 25:33.240
it's Grace.

25:37.640 --> 25:40.560
[tense music]

25:50.240 --> 25:51.920
Samira's in the passenger seat.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.280
[indistinct chatter]

25:56.440 --> 25:58.720
Hello, Samira.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.040
-Where's your husband?
-[Samira] I wish I knew.

26:09.560 --> 26:12.120
What's this, Samira?

26:12.280 --> 26:13.640
Cannabis.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.040
This looks identical
to the package

26:15.200 --> 26:16.840
we found in Harry's toolbox.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.600
Supports the idea that the Harts
were using him as a courier.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.520
I'm gonna take a look round
the restaurant.

26:24.040 --> 26:26.960
[suspenseful music]

27:00.600 --> 27:02.120
-Where are my kids?
-Your mum is with them.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.440
I wanna see them.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.240
We can arrange that for you,
of course.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.040
But in the meantime
it'd be really helpful

27:08.200 --> 27:10.280
if you could let us know how you
really met Harry Steadman.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.880
A young police officer,

27:23.560 --> 27:25.320
Tyler Bates was his name,
he was knifed to death

27:25.480 --> 27:27.280
about a year ago.

27:27.440 --> 27:30.760
Some of the locals decided
to hold a vigil.

27:30.920 --> 27:33.600
Josh thought it'd be a good
chance to sell some weed.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.680
And you met Harry there?

27:41.120 --> 27:42.240
Yeah.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.640
Tyler was knifed to death
outside the pub

27:45.800 --> 27:47.480
that Harry lived in.

27:47.640 --> 27:50.320
Harry felt bad, that's why he
was at the vigil.

27:50.480 --> 27:51.680
So, what happened?

27:53.640 --> 27:56.360
PC Bates was black,

27:56.520 --> 27:58.920
and the pub was a notorious
right wing dive.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.920
Someone recognized Harry,

28:03.080 --> 28:06.160
everyone started screaming
at him, he was crying and...

28:06.320 --> 28:09.040
I ended up stepping in.

28:09.200 --> 28:10.880
So, you came to his rescue?

28:12.280 --> 28:14.840
You don't know me.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.720
He was in trouble, I couldn't
just stand there and do nothing.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.680
Good for you.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.440
After that,

28:25.600 --> 28:27.520
he started coming into
the restaurant.

28:29.800 --> 28:33.960
And we got friendly, I think he
just needed someone to talk to.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.120
Especially, after his
sister in law died.

28:37.840 --> 28:39.920
Sister in law? Doug's wife?

28:41.840 --> 28:45.560
Yeah he loved her. He never
stopped talking about Grace.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.320
Grace Steadman?

28:47.480 --> 28:49.040
No, not Steadman, I don't think
her and Harry's brother

28:49.200 --> 28:50.160
were actually married.

28:50.320 --> 28:53.080
Um, I think her name was Harper?

28:54.640 --> 28:56.360
Yeah, that's it, Grace Harper.

29:04.520 --> 29:09.040
Uh, interview suspended
at 16:23.

29:13.160 --> 29:14.840
I'm sorry.

29:17.440 --> 29:20.880
I made the connection, between
Harry Steadman and Grace Harper,

29:21.040 --> 29:24.360
the Detective Inspector
asked me not to tell you.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.680
All I know is that Grace
Harper's been killed.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.320
What's going on, Rob?

29:29.480 --> 29:32.000
I'm the one who found
Grace Harper dead.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.160
What? How?

29:34.320 --> 29:36.920
I was doing David's dirty work
as usual.

29:37.080 --> 29:38.120
We're in the middle of
an interview!

29:38.280 --> 29:40.320
I'm sure you can handle it.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.480
What's going on here?

29:42.640 --> 29:44.080
Chief Superintendent.

29:46.320 --> 29:50.000
Trainee Detective Constable
Billie Fitzgerald.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.880
Did your colleague
just leave you

29:54.040 --> 29:56.320
to conduct
an interview on your own?

29:56.480 --> 29:59.800
-He's been called away.
-Oh, has he now?

29:59.960 --> 30:01.520
Who's your line manager?

30:01.680 --> 30:03.120
Vivienne Cole?

30:05.320 --> 30:08.120
[tense music]

30:11.640 --> 30:15.280
Grace Harper. Did you think
I wouldn't find out?

30:15.440 --> 30:17.400
-I was worried.
-About what?

30:17.560 --> 30:20.560
-About how you'd react.
-Sorry?

30:20.720 --> 30:22.960
Let's face it, Rob, ever since
you found Grace dead,

30:23.120 --> 30:23.840
you've been falling to pieces.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.680
And whose fault's that?

30:29.440 --> 30:31.240
Detective Sergeant Cole.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.360
Chief Superintendent.

30:34.520 --> 30:35.960
Good to see you.

30:36.120 --> 30:38.040
Can-can I help you, sir?

30:38.200 --> 30:42.360
This trainee detective has been
abandoned by her colleague.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.480
Detective Constable Brady.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.120
Detective Constable Brady,

30:48.280 --> 30:50.400
in the middle of an interview.

30:50.560 --> 30:53.400
Apparently he got called away.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.440
He needed to speak to
the Detective Inspector.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.200
I'll sort it, sir.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.360
Thank you for bringing the
matter to my attention.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.760
I think it's best if you sit
in the interview,

31:02.920 --> 31:04.600
along with Billie here.

31:06.400 --> 31:09.240
I'm going to have a word with
Detective Constable Brady.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.280
Do me a favour.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.320
That's what you say to me
time and time again.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.520
Because we're mates.
As well as colleagues.

31:20.680 --> 31:21.920
You're a mate when it suits you.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.240
Getting me to lie for you.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.560
Do the things that
you don't wanna do.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.560
I just asked you to check up
on Grace.

31:26.720 --> 31:29.080
I didn't know you were gonna
find her dead.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.840
I know you've been struggling
ever since.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.520
I've been trying to
cover for you.

31:32.680 --> 31:34.760
I've got a six week old baby
at home that won't sleep.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.880
Come on, Rob. This has been
going on for months.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.280
Are you telling me I'm not
capable of doing my job?

31:39.440 --> 31:41.080
You can't carry on like this.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.640
-Why won't you let me help you?
-I don't need help.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.000
I offered you counselling
after Grace Harper.

31:46.160 --> 31:47.360
You turned it down.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.360
Stop going on about bloody
Grace Harper!

31:49.520 --> 31:51.840
Hope I'm not interrupting
anything important?

31:53.640 --> 31:55.480
-Sir.
-Sir.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.880
I could hear you two halfway
down the corridor.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.520
What the hell is going on?

32:03.040 --> 32:05.960
So, Rob found Grace Harper dead.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.720
He did.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.280
What happened is on a need to
know basis.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.920
I don't have the full story.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.640
Believe me, sarge, I'm one
person who doesn't need to know.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.680
I'm happy just getting on
with my job.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.560
If you could give us a moment,
detective?

32:21.720 --> 32:23.040
Of course.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.680
So, David,
what is going on here?

32:32.320 --> 32:35.080
We've been investigating
the murder of a young man.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.200
Turns out he's related to
another murder victim.

32:38.360 --> 32:40.680
Something Detective Constable
Brady was working on?

32:40.840 --> 32:42.240
No.

32:42.400 --> 32:45.280
He found the first victim dead.

32:45.440 --> 32:48.200
In my opinion,
he's never got over it.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.920
That's curious.

32:52.080 --> 32:55.560
Given what you do day in,
day out.

32:55.720 --> 32:59.000
Why do you think that experience
affected him so profoundly?

33:01.480 --> 33:03.320
I really don't know.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.360
But he's a good detective?

33:05.520 --> 33:07.360
The best.

33:07.520 --> 33:10.000
Right.
We need to sort this out.

33:10.160 --> 33:13.080
[instrumental music]

33:21.600 --> 33:24.960
-Detective Constable Brady.
-Sir.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.160
I'm assuming you two have a
favourite boozer,

33:27.320 --> 33:28.920
somewhere local?

33:29.080 --> 33:31.560
-Of course.
-Good.

33:31.720 --> 33:32.880
Buy this man a drink.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.360
I've gotta drop this phone
back to the lab.

33:34.520 --> 33:36.720
No. That can wait.

33:38.680 --> 33:41.760
The police service depends on
teamwork and trust.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.440
-You need to rebuild your team.
-Sir.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.120
I don't want either of you
leaving the pub

33:51.280 --> 33:53.840
until you've settled
your differences.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.560
That's an order.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.960
[tense music]

34:03.880 --> 34:06.960
This isn't all on Josh.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.440
'Cause I was the one that
insisted we send the kids

34:08.600 --> 34:09.880
to that school, and it costs
an arm and a leg,

34:10.040 --> 34:12.520
and I told Josh he just had to
find the money.

34:12.680 --> 34:15.400
So, Harry was just a courier?
He wasn't dealing?

34:15.560 --> 34:18.440
Yeah, Harry wasn't sharp enough
to deal.

34:18.600 --> 34:21.640
Josh said the punters would
have him for breakfast.

34:21.800 --> 34:24.040
Was Josh paying Harry
the going rate?

34:25.520 --> 34:26.920
Course not.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.240
Josh is very good at taking
advantage

34:30.400 --> 34:32.880
of people's troubles
and insecurities.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.360
What do you mean?

34:36.840 --> 34:39.200
Harry wanted to move out
of the pub.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.720
Get away from his brother.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.960
Josh persuaded him
that he'd need cash, and that

34:44.120 --> 34:46.680
ferrying drugs round in
his toolbox was how to get it.

34:46.840 --> 34:50.480
Why did Harry want to get away
from his brother?

34:50.640 --> 34:53.040
Something to do with
what happened to Grace I think.

34:53.200 --> 34:55.320
[knocking on door]

34:59.160 --> 35:00.880
What about my house?

35:01.040 --> 35:03.640
We can help you find
someone to clear it up.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.760
I'll be surprised if it can be
sorted today though.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.960
Samira, your husband just
used his Oyster Card

35:11.120 --> 35:12.280
at Surrey Quays Station.

35:12.440 --> 35:15.240
Have you any idea where he
might be headed?

35:15.400 --> 35:17.480
Uh, his friend Dan
lives near there.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.560
Dan who?

35:19.720 --> 35:21.920
Dan Hardcastle I think.
They went to uni together.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.480
And what's their connection now?

35:25.080 --> 35:26.920
Dan supplies the weed
that Josh sells.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.680
I don't suppose you've got
Dan's address?

35:31.840 --> 35:33.640
I don't, I just know
that he lives on a houseboat

35:33.800 --> 35:35.000
in Surrey Quays.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.320
[suspenseful music]

36:02.120 --> 36:05.760
His name is Rob Brady,
wife and three kids.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.440
This is the address.

36:10.080 --> 36:13.000
I reckon you've got an hour,
tops.

36:13.160 --> 36:14.280
Ta.

36:15.680 --> 36:16.840
I've got to get that phone back.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.400
If you get caught,
you're on your own.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.520
Yeah, we both know
that's not true, don't we?

36:27.040 --> 36:29.960
[intense music]

36:45.720 --> 36:47.160
You sure you don't want
a proper drink?

36:47.320 --> 36:48.880
This is fine. Thanks.

36:50.680 --> 36:52.520
[sighs]

36:58.680 --> 37:01.760
Okay, so, council tax records
give me a D Hardcastle,

37:01.920 --> 37:03.400
the boat is moored
at Surrey Quays.

37:03.560 --> 37:04.920
This sounds promising.

37:05.080 --> 37:06.480
Only thing is, I've cross
checked the address

37:06.640 --> 37:09.120
with the electoral roll
and it comes up as Danielle.

37:09.280 --> 37:10.520
That's very interesting.

37:10.680 --> 37:11.800
Do you wanna get a drugs
warrant?

37:11.960 --> 37:12.960
No, we don't have time.

37:13.120 --> 37:14.320
I will text the
detective inspector

37:14.480 --> 37:16.160
and let him know what we're
proposing to do.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.960
[suspenseful music]

37:44.440 --> 37:47.920
When did Cherry tell you
she was pregnant?

37:48.080 --> 37:50.360
She was about three weeks
in I think.

37:50.520 --> 37:52.240
I don't mean that.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.680
How close to you finding
Grace dead?

37:54.840 --> 37:56.000
Pretty close.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.200
-Same day.
-Day after.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.760
Day after you found a young
woman dead

38:04.920 --> 38:07.040
on her living room floor.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.760
And her baby looking on.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.920
What's your point?

38:12.080 --> 38:14.800
Don't tell me you think
I've got Post Traumatic Stress.

38:17.440 --> 38:19.560
I had a colleague...

38:19.720 --> 38:22.320
attended a bombing where
a lot of people died.

38:24.120 --> 38:26.120
He saw terrible things.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.120
He always said it didn't
affect him, it was...

38:32.280 --> 38:34.240
just another day on duty.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.520
Years later,

38:42.680 --> 38:44.720
he saw a clip about it on TV.

38:46.440 --> 38:48.560
He was off work for a year.

38:51.480 --> 38:53.520
That's not what's happening
to me.

38:57.320 --> 39:00.200
[suspenseful music]

39:09.760 --> 39:12.680
[baby crying]

39:22.000 --> 39:24.720
[music continues]

39:46.960 --> 39:48.360
What you said earlier,

39:49.840 --> 39:52.440
you were right.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.080
I can't do this anymore.

39:55.680 --> 40:00.520
Please, stop beating yourself
up, Rob.

40:00.680 --> 40:02.800
Grace was under my protection.

40:04.840 --> 40:06.440
I promised I'd look after her.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.400
I'm the one who let her down.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.080
When her name came up today,
I...

40:18.000 --> 40:20.680
I couldn't face talking to you
about it.

40:20.840 --> 40:22.200
All over again.

40:23.760 --> 40:25.440
I couldn't look you in the eye.

40:27.400 --> 40:28.600
You don't understand.

40:29.600 --> 40:30.880
I do.

40:31.040 --> 40:32.200
When I said I can't do this
anymore,

40:32.360 --> 40:34.240
I wasn't talking about Grace.

40:36.680 --> 40:38.880
I was talking about the job.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.040
I can't do this job anymore.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.280
You know what
I'm saying is true.

40:50.800 --> 40:54.360
You're just tired. Exhausted.

40:54.520 --> 40:55.720
It's not just that.

40:57.400 --> 41:00.080
I can't face the crime scenes,

41:00.240 --> 41:01.600
the families.

41:09.040 --> 41:11.560
Promise me you won't make
any decisions

41:11.720 --> 41:13.480
without talking to me first.

41:18.080 --> 41:20.040
Why don't you go home now?

41:20.200 --> 41:23.120
See, if you can get your head
down for a few hours.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.920
I've gotta drop this phone off
at the lab.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.560
Do it on the way.

41:28.640 --> 41:29.960
Okay.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.320
[dramatic music]

42:04.000 --> 42:05.640
That's it.

42:11.240 --> 42:13.640
[music continues]

42:26.520 --> 42:27.960
Wait.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.720
[music playing on stereo]

42:42.080 --> 42:45.760
Police! Don't move.

42:45.920 --> 42:48.120
Don't you move.

42:50.680 --> 42:52.720
Right, you're gonna be sorry
you did that.

42:52.880 --> 42:55.080
Josh Hart. I'm arresting you
on suspicion of

42:55.240 --> 42:57.640
possession of a controlled drug
with intent to supply.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.960
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

43:00.120 --> 43:01.560
if you do not mention
when questioned,

43:01.720 --> 43:03.440
something which you later
rely on in court.

43:03.600 --> 43:06.400
Anything you do say may be
given in evidence.

43:06.560 --> 43:08.360
You're really, really pretty.

43:14.920 --> 43:17.160
Well, someone's gonna have to
recover it.

43:19.520 --> 43:21.080
You are kidding?

43:24.720 --> 43:25.920
[sighs]

43:34.840 --> 43:36.320
Clever girl.

43:39.080 --> 43:41.920
[dramatic music]

44:20.120 --> 44:21.280
[knocks]

44:21.440 --> 44:23.760
-You Rob Brady?
-Who's asking?

44:30.000 --> 44:31.440
That's my house.

44:33.640 --> 44:37.000
My girls' bedroom. What?

44:37.160 --> 44:39.560
If you value the lives of
your children,

44:39.720 --> 44:41.800
you'll give me the phone
you found this morning.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.440
[suspenseful music]

45:01.880 --> 45:03.160
[thud]

45:06.040 --> 45:08.920
[music continues]

45:19.440 --> 45:22.640
According to Josh Hart,
Harry was scared.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.480
I think you're right, Harry's
death had nothing to do

45:24.640 --> 45:27.560
with drugs and everything to do
with shutting him up.

45:27.720 --> 45:29.200
Josh also said something else.

45:29.360 --> 45:30.880
What?

45:31.040 --> 45:33.600
He said the killer had friends
in high places.

45:33.760 --> 45:35.520
That's why they won't get
caught.

45:37.480 --> 45:39.480
I'm guessing you already
knew that?

45:42.280 --> 45:46.080
We're sure the killer is
a serving police officer.

45:46.240 --> 45:48.360
-Do you know who?
-Not yet.

45:48.520 --> 45:51.200
We've worked out how to
break the killer's cover.

45:51.360 --> 45:55.120

46:04.680 --> 46:07.440
Another serving officer.

46:07.600 --> 46:11.280
And no one knows that officer
better than you.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.600
