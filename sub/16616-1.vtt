00:01.543 --> 00:04.963
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:05.047 --> 00:08.050
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:11.970
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:12.054 --> 00:14.431
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.057 --> 00:17.935
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.393 --> 00:21.563
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.730 --> 00:23.148
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:24.900
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.983 --> 00:30.155
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:34.993 --> 00:37.663
<i>We now return</i>
<i>to the extended director's cut</i>

00:37.746 --> 00:39.915
<i>of</i> Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.547
Charlie, don't forget
what happened to the boy

00:46.630 --> 00:48.173
who got everything he ever wanted.

00:48.257 --> 00:50.425
- What?
- He lived happily ever after.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.302
But he did have to earn it.

00:52.845 --> 00:53.846
Hint, hint.

00:53.929 --> 00:54.972
Do it, Charlie!

00:55.097 --> 00:57.391
I'm not going back to that four-person
bed.

00:57.516 --> 00:59.226
Hell, I'll do it if you want!

00:59.309 --> 01:00.936
No, it has to be a child!

01:01.395 --> 01:02.646
What did he just say?

01:02.729 --> 01:05.566
Brian, this does not seem appropriate
to watch in front of the baby.

01:05.649 --> 01:06.859
Not appropriate?

01:06.942 --> 01:09.528
You took me to see<i> Magic Mike XXL.</i>

01:10.946 --> 01:12.531
Nope, this one's wet.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.032
Ugh, this one too.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.868
Also wet.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.911
Huh! This one's dry,

01:17.995 --> 01:20.163
but the back of the seat
and front of it is wet.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.958
Let's put on something more
child-friendly.

01:24.084 --> 01:27.129
<i>Time to Too-Tootie-Too</i>
<i>with</i> The Turtlenecks.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.673
Oh, God, no! These guys are horrible.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.760
<i>Do you kazoo?</i>
<i>I often do</i>

01:34.011 --> 01:36.805
<i>When I am blue</i>
<i>I do kazoo</i>

01:37.264 --> 01:38.724
<i>Toot-tootie-too</i>

01:38.807 --> 01:40.392
<i>Goes my kazoo</i>

01:40.475 --> 01:41.768
<i>I will kazoo</i>

01:41.852 --> 01:43.145
<i>Hey, how about you?</i>

01:44.354 --> 01:46.982
Ugh, all they're doing is announcing
that they play the kazoo

01:47.065 --> 01:49.484
and then asking
if others also play the kazoo.

01:49.568 --> 01:50.903
This doesn't seem so bad.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.654
And after all, it's a song for babies.

01:52.738 --> 01:53.989
Yeah, but that's the thing.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.700
Baby songs never tackle real baby issues.

01:57.159 --> 01:59.620
You know, like loud noises or teething,

01:59.703 --> 02:02.080
or when Dad uses me as a lumbar pillow.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.707
- Ow.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.376
- Ow. Ow. Ow.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.212
- Ow.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.339
This things works better in the car.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.049
Well, how could they address baby issues?

02:12.132 --> 02:14.051
Children songs are written by adults.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.970
And, dollars to donuts, white adults.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.722
I... Who you mad at, Brian?

02:18.805 --> 02:20.265
Ugh, how much time you got?

02:20.349 --> 02:21.475
Not enough for that, but you're right.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.728
If you want a song a baby'll like,
you've gotta get a baby to write it.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.064
Well, call John Mayer,
he's a big fat baby.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.941
No, I'll do it and you could help.

02:29.024 --> 02:32.069
Well, I... I did write a musical
about Alexander Hamilton.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.571
Not... Not that one. But sure, I'm in.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.281
Ooh, I'm excited! This will be great!

02:36.365 --> 02:38.784
And those guys back at the factory
can suck it!

02:39.201 --> 02:41.203
I'm gonna get out of this place one day.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.288
Hey, Butch, get a load of Stewie!

02:43.372 --> 02:44.957
He says he's gonna get out of here.

02:46.542 --> 02:49.294
You don't know me, man.
I'm different. I got ideas.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.879
Hey, Butch, you hear that?

02:50.963 --> 02:52.506
Stewie's got ideas.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.424
Shut up! I'm gonna go across that river

02:54.508 --> 02:56.468
and make it to the city on the other side.

02:56.552 --> 02:57.803
I'm gonna be a singer.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.264
Bublé over here says he's gonna
be a singer.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.432
Hey, Bublé, I got a tune for you to sing.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.894
It's called, "Get your ass back
on the forklift. Lunch is over."

03:07.271 --> 03:09.731
Hey, Stewie, don't listen to those guys,

03:09.815 --> 03:11.108
follow your heart.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.110
Shut up, Butch.
You're the loser of this crew.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.236
Hey, guys, you hear that?

03:14.319 --> 03:15.863
Butch told me to follow my heart.

03:23.287 --> 03:27.457
Dad, can I have 50 bucks
for a shamrock tattoo? It's time.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.002
All right, but make sure you get it
where everyone can see.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.838
Hold on, Peter,
if Chris wants money for something,

03:32.921 --> 03:35.007
maybe it's time he got a part-time job.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.384
He could mow lawns or babysit.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.136
I can't work, I'm too young.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.638
Oh, Will Smith's little kid
works as a movie star,

03:41.722 --> 03:43.473
even though he looks like
a wet baby horse.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.684
All right, I suppose I could get a job.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.770
Or maybe even my old job
as the guy racing through an airport

03:48.854 --> 03:50.480
at the end of a romantic comedy.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.650
Taxi! Taxi!

03:54.818 --> 03:56.403
Hey, are you crazy?

03:56.486 --> 03:57.863
Crazy for love!

03:57.946 --> 04:01.909
The most amazing girl I've ever met
leaves on a plane in five minutes.

04:01.992 --> 04:03.076
Get in!

04:05.454 --> 04:07.039
<i>I get knocked down</i>

04:07.122 --> 04:08.332
<i>But I get up again</i>

04:08.415 --> 04:10.125
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

04:10.209 --> 04:11.710
<i>I get knocked down</i>

04:11.793 --> 04:13.045
<i>But I get up again</i>

04:13.128 --> 04:14.880
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

04:16.465 --> 04:17.633
What the hell's going on?

04:17.966 --> 04:20.093
- This guy's in love.
- Is she worth it?

04:20.177 --> 04:22.387
She's a once-in-a-lifetime girl.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.722
We'll give you an escort.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.433
<i>He drinks a whiskey drink</i>
<i>He drinks a vodka drink</i>

04:26.517 --> 04:28.894
<i>He drinks a lager drink</i>
<i>He drinks a cider drink</i>

04:30.145 --> 04:31.188
No charge!

04:33.774 --> 04:34.816
<i>Final boarding call</i>

04:34.900 --> 04:37.277
<i>for Ashley's flight</i>
<i>to Stuffy New England College.</i>

04:37.361 --> 04:38.445
<i>Final boarding.</i>

04:38.529 --> 04:41.448
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, child!
What's the hurry?

04:41.532 --> 04:43.534
The love of my life, that's what!

04:44.076 --> 04:47.746
We got a Code Romeo, repeat Code Romeo.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.917
If we get there on time,
there's an extra $50 in it for ya.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.002
I love this job!

04:54.086 --> 04:56.547
<i>I get knocked down</i>
<i>But I get up again</i>

04:56.672 --> 04:58.507
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

04:58.590 --> 04:59.883
Ashley, wait!

05:02.511 --> 05:05.931
I wouldn't miss this
for all the rush-hour fares in big town!

05:06.014 --> 05:07.641
Chris, you came!

05:07.724 --> 05:10.310
Oh, my God! Let me get my grandma.

05:13.063 --> 05:16.233
- Chris?
- Ashley, I love you!

05:20.654 --> 05:22.239
Ew!

05:22.322 --> 05:23.991
Oh, you're groaning at me?

05:24.074 --> 05:26.785
You paid $19 to fly Spirit Air.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.412
You get what you get.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.793
All right, Brian.
I've written a few songs.

05:34.877 --> 05:37.296
All about stuff babies actually
care about.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.173
No more rainbows and unicorns.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.549
Real baby issues!

05:40.632 --> 05:42.176
Right, like heartworm and parvo?

05:42.259 --> 05:43.468
No, baby stuff!

05:43.552 --> 05:45.053
Oh, oh, human babies!

05:45.137 --> 05:47.222
I didn't... I didn't realize
there was an agenda.

05:47.306 --> 05:48.724
Okay, look, just pay attention.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.935
<i>Mama liked to party</i>
<i>when you were in her belly</i>

05:52.019 --> 05:54.062
<i>Drinkin', she did some</i>

05:54.146 --> 05:56.273
<i>Mama liked to party</i>
<i>when you were in her belly</i>

05:56.356 --> 05:58.233
<i>That's why you are dumb</i>

05:58.609 --> 06:02.362
I call that, "Mama Liked to Party,"
parenthesis, "Chris' Song."

06:02.446 --> 06:03.447
Stewie, that's good!

06:03.530 --> 06:05.657
- Hey, can I write one?
- Yeah, we need as many as we can.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.285
Our first gig is Saturday.
It's a birthday party.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.829
Wow, already?
How did you book a gig so fast?

06:10.913 --> 06:13.290
Easy, I figured out the perfect way
to get the word out

06:13.373 --> 06:14.583
to middle-aged moms.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.170
Musical entertainment,
available for parties!

06:18.921 --> 06:20.839
Musical entertainment,
available for parties!

06:21.673 --> 06:23.800
Hey, where are you
drinking that Chardonnay?

06:29.306 --> 06:31.016
Oh, hey, Chris, how's your job hunt going?

06:31.099 --> 06:33.727
Terrible. I can't find a job anywhere.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.397
A lot of people seem to be turned off
by my dishonorable discharge.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.691
- What, from the army?
- No, it's a euphemism.

06:39.775 --> 06:40.901
Oh, yucky.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.612
Uh, you guys,
I need help unloading the groceries.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.448
My undiagnosed mom injury is flaring up.

06:48.534 --> 06:51.954
These little things of apple sauce
better not be for desserts.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.956
Go to hell, Glenn Quagmire!

06:54.039 --> 06:56.375
I'm sorry, but Mondays are Asian only.

06:56.458 --> 06:57.751
Why is your last name Wong?

06:57.835 --> 06:59.628
It's my married name.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.296
Now I see why you're here.

07:02.756 --> 07:03.882
Geez, what was that about?

07:03.966 --> 07:05.300
Ah. Little scheduling mix-up.

07:05.676 --> 07:06.885
I'm just so busy.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.054
I don't have any time
to organize my own life.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.391
Wait a minute. What if you had someone
to help keep you organized?

07:12.474 --> 07:14.268
Chris is looking for work,
maybe he can help you out.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.352
Be your assistant.

07:15.602 --> 07:16.854
Huh, maybe.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.021
You have any references?

07:18.105 --> 07:21.233
Uh, "cowabunga," "Schwing,"
"yada-yada-yada."

07:21.316 --> 07:23.485
Those are pretty good references.
You're hired!

07:27.656 --> 07:28.907
Look at that. Look at the cake.

07:28.991 --> 07:31.618
"Happy birthday, Charlie and Uncle Craig."

07:31.702 --> 07:33.996
And "Uncle Craig"
is written in a different color.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.415
Oh, poor Uncle Craig.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.458
Hey, is that your ex-girlfriend Olivia?

07:38.542 --> 07:39.793
God, what's she doing here?

07:39.877 --> 07:41.253
She was always such a nightmare.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.258
Olivia! Oh, my God! Do I look okay?

07:46.341 --> 07:48.385
I hate this shirt!
Switch shirts! Switch shirts!

07:48.468 --> 07:51.138
Stewie? Oh, I thought that was you!

07:51.346 --> 07:53.849
Hey, Olivia... Hey, what brings you here?

07:53.932 --> 07:57.102
Oh. The birthday boy and I
met at Burt Reynolds' acting camp

07:57.186 --> 07:58.395
in Jupiter, Florida.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.439
Well, I'm glad to hear you're
still acting.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.608
You know, the last time
I saw you, you were...

08:02.691 --> 08:05.319
- Burning in a cardboard house.
- Yeah, burning in a cardboard house, yeah.

08:05.402 --> 08:08.697
Uh, hey, listen, I don't know if you've
heard, but we're the entertainment.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.365
Aw, that's good.

08:10.449 --> 08:13.035
- Good for you!
- Okay, great to see ya.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.037
Come on, Stewie, it's not about her.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.788
It's about those six children watching

08:16.872 --> 08:18.957
and the spazzy kid
who is just waiting for the snakes.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.667
Bring out the snakes!

08:24.338 --> 08:26.089
It's a hot crowd. Have fun out there!

08:26.173 --> 08:28.592
I'm gonna go feed
everything in my van to each other.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.137
Okay, kids, if everyone's done
washing their hands from the snakes,

08:32.221 --> 08:33.597
we have some fun music...

08:33.680 --> 08:35.474
No climbing on the boat!

08:35.557 --> 08:38.477
Okay, now, please welcome
Red Shirt Blue Shirt.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.231
All right, we are Red Shirt Blue Shirt,

08:42.314 --> 08:45.275
and here's a song we call,
"Mommy and Daddy's Room."

08:45.359 --> 08:47.110
And we think it's one you can
all relate to.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.156
<i>When everybody's gone to sleep</i>

08:51.240 --> 08:53.158
<i>And you've said, "Good night, moon"</i>

08:53.242 --> 08:56.995
<i>There's plenty of noise still comin'</i>
<i>from Mommy and Daddy's room</i>

08:57.079 --> 08:59.706
<i>Oh, Daddy says, "Please"</i>
<i>Mommy says, "No"</i>

08:59.790 --> 09:01.750
<i>Daddy says, "Come on"</i>
<i>Mommy says, "Whoa"</i>

09:01.834 --> 09:03.836
<i>Daddy goes, "Ungh!"</i>
<i>Mommy goes, "Ow!"</i>

09:03.919 --> 09:06.004
<i>Daddy says, "I'm done"</i>
<i>Mommy goes, "Wow"</i>

09:06.088 --> 09:08.048
<i>Daddy rolls over and falls asleep</i>

09:08.131 --> 09:09.633
<i>Mommy drinks wine in the dark</i>

09:15.556 --> 09:17.724
My God, did you hear them, Stewie?
We're a hit!

09:17.808 --> 09:19.017
We gotta go out and celebrate.

09:19.101 --> 09:22.187
Oh, he can't go out with you tonight.
He's got a date with me.

09:22.271 --> 09:23.647
Really? Awesome!

09:23.730 --> 09:25.482
Brian, I can't go. I'm not feeling well.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.609
Stewie, I've been standing here
the whole time.

09:27.693 --> 09:28.819
But, you know, you know what? That's fine.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.446
I'll just go have a dog-style
celebration by myself.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.575
Yeah! Awesome time!

09:35.284 --> 09:36.702
This is very fun for me!

09:36.785 --> 09:37.995
- Hey!
- Oh, hey!

09:38.495 --> 09:40.497
- This is fun, right?
- The best!

09:40.581 --> 09:41.707
And me, too!

09:48.964 --> 09:51.508
- Great crowd, babe.
- What is... What is this?

09:51.592 --> 09:53.552
Oh, Olivia's president of our fan club.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.804
She's also doing half the band.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.055
You even know what that means?

09:57.139 --> 09:59.600
Uh, let's just say
I couldn't toddle right for a week.

09:59.683 --> 10:00.809
Okay, you don't.

10:00.893 --> 10:03.520
All right, if you'll excuse me,
I have a poo-poo diaper.

10:05.147 --> 10:07.107
You really think this Olivia thing
is a good idea?

10:07.191 --> 10:08.233
Why wouldn't it be?

10:08.317 --> 10:11.236
I don't know. It just seems like
it always ends badly for you two.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.280
And it can be tricky, working with an ex.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.073
Look at Kermit and Miss Piggy.

10:15.324 --> 10:18.035
How you feeling, Miss Piggy?
I heard you called in sick yesterday.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.078
Yeah, I had a frog in my throat.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.915
Right, Kermit? Huh? Right?

10:22.998 --> 10:24.666
Please stop drinking.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.632
Okay, Chris, I think
you're gonna be a great assistant.

10:31.715 --> 10:34.134
Your paperwork appears to be in order,
but before we get started,

10:34.218 --> 10:35.719
do you own a pair of rubber boots

10:35.802 --> 10:37.846
that you'd have to wear
if you worked on a fishing boat?

10:37.930 --> 10:39.640
Uh, no, I don't think so.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.141
All right, I guess it'll be a light
day today,

10:41.225 --> 10:42.643
but tomorrow
you should come wearing those.

10:42.726 --> 10:43.727
Okay, got it.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.812
Now, the first thing
I need you to do every morning

10:45.896 --> 10:48.398
is punch me in the stomach,
because I'm a bad person.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.609
Is this a trick?

10:50.692 --> 10:52.611
It's the furthest thing from a trick.
Go ahead.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.447
And it should be pretty hard.
I'm a worse person than you think.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.075
Okay, that's really good.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.786
Now I need you to call Time Warner
about my cable bill.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.959
All right, this one
is for all the mommies out there.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.837
This is what we're really saying
when we're crying.

11:09.920 --> 11:13.382
<i>Please put some butt paste</i>
<i>on my button</i>

11:13.465 --> 11:15.300
<i>Butt paste on my button</i>

11:15.384 --> 11:18.136
<i>Smear it on my button</i>
<i>for the fire down below</i>

11:19.429 --> 11:21.306
<i>Butt paste on my button</i>

11:21.390 --> 11:23.350
<i>Butt paste on my button</i>

11:23.433 --> 11:27.020
<i>Need it on my button</i>
<i>'cause it cools and quells me so</i>

11:29.982 --> 11:32.109
<i>Stay away, stay away</i>

11:32.192 --> 11:34.695
<i>From the big kid in the baby swing</i>

11:38.574 --> 11:40.325
<i>There's a little metal box</i>

11:40.409 --> 11:42.536
<i>At the top of the stairs</i>

11:42.619 --> 11:44.788
<i>In the back of the closet</i>

11:44.872 --> 11:46.874
<i>And a tiny little key</i>

11:46.957 --> 11:48.625
<i>That's hidden in the book</i>

11:48.709 --> 11:50.752
<i>In the drawer with the socks</i>

11:50.836 --> 11:53.005
<i>And I know how to use it</i>

11:53.088 --> 11:55.090
<i>To open up the box</i>

11:56.049 --> 11:58.760
<i>And that's where the gun is</i>

12:04.766 --> 12:05.934
You know, I talk a lot of smack,

12:06.018 --> 12:07.811
but at the end of the day,
these guys are pros.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.314
Even broken arm coyote with washboard.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.108
Hey, let's keep this party rolling.

12:13.192 --> 12:16.320
I'll go get us another badly-scratched
plastic pitcher of soda.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.365
Ugh, finally he's doing something useful.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.201
- What? What do you mean?
- Nothing.

12:22.284 --> 12:25.078
It's just, you write all the songs,
you've got a better voice,

12:25.162 --> 12:26.663
you've got the sweet bod.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.874
Oh, my God! Babe!

12:28.957 --> 12:32.377
Plus, you've got all the cool
catchphrases like, "Damn you all"

12:32.461 --> 12:33.921
or "What the dude" or whatever.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.548
Uh, it's "deuce". But yeah, you're right.

12:36.632 --> 12:39.843
I do... Does it sound through the mike
like I'm saying "dude"?

12:39.927 --> 12:40.969
Should it be "dude"?

12:41.053 --> 12:43.639
Meanwhile, everyone thinks
Brian is the star of the group.

12:43.722 --> 12:44.890
- Who thinks that?
- I don't know.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.350
I'm just saying, after every show,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.894
the fans are always petting Brian
and not you.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.562
No one's allowed to pet me, it's illegal.

12:50.646 --> 12:52.105
I just hate to see Brian

12:52.189 --> 12:55.150
getting all the attention
that you deserve.

12:55.234 --> 12:56.818
You should really watch your back.

12:57.486 --> 13:00.197
Wow, it's hard to believe
Brian would betray me.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.658
I mean, he was there for me
when I hit rock bottom.

13:03.659 --> 13:05.953
See, Brian, that's a rock bottom.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.246
Thanks for being here for that.

13:07.329 --> 13:09.665
Now get out of here.
We're about to drink some Chardonnay.

13:15.254 --> 13:17.506
Chris, could you please get Hannah
a thank-you basket

13:17.589 --> 13:20.300
and schedule her next appointment?
I'd like to see her again in two weeks.

13:20.384 --> 13:24.263
Of course. Mr. Quagmire can fit in you
at 3:00 a week from Thursday.

13:24.346 --> 13:25.389
That works.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.975
- And you know to fast the night before?
- Yep.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.269
And would you like to leave
your panties in the fish bowl

13:30.352 --> 13:32.187
for a chance to win a free lunch?

13:35.190 --> 13:36.191
Good luck!

13:36.275 --> 13:38.110
When are you gonna do
that drawing anyway?

13:38.193 --> 13:40.279
Oh, there's no drawing.
I just like smelling the bowl.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.155
You know, you're doing a great job, Chris.

13:42.239 --> 13:44.157
Why don't you jerk the rest
of the day off?

13:44.825 --> 13:46.618
Man, this is the best job ever.

13:46.702 --> 13:49.621
And to think I almost took
that pop-up restaurant gig.

13:50.581 --> 13:51.623
Hi! You hungry?

14:02.342 --> 14:03.927
<i>Check, check. Malia, check,</i>

14:04.011 --> 14:06.763
<i>Obama, check, check, check. Malia Obama.</i>

14:06.847 --> 14:08.348
All right, that's a creepy mike check.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.559
Let's just do a quick
run-through of "Little Brother."

14:13.020 --> 14:15.147
<i>I want a little brother</i>

14:17.232 --> 14:19.651
<i>On second thought</i>

14:19.735 --> 14:24.114
<i>I think I'd kill him dead</i>

14:24.198 --> 14:25.616
<i>Could we just cut Brian's mike?</i>

14:25.699 --> 14:28.035
<i>His humming sounds like</i>
<i>my table's ready at Chili's.</i>

14:28.118 --> 14:30.746
- Stewie, what the hell is your problem?
- I'll tell you what my problem is.

14:30.829 --> 14:33.332
I'm doing all the work
and you're just riding my coattails.

14:33.415 --> 14:34.458
What are you taking about?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.168
I'm just as big a part of this group
as you are.

14:36.251 --> 14:39.922
Oh, really? You're writing about
all your authentic baby experiences?

14:40.005 --> 14:42.674
You asked me to do this with you.
Why are you being such a dick?

14:42.758 --> 14:44.635
Because I lost the baby!

14:46.011 --> 14:47.137
What was that?

14:47.221 --> 14:49.097
I don't know, he saw that
in a movie or something.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.183
Brian, this seems a good as time as any.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.810
I think it's time to talk about
your future with the band.

14:53.894 --> 14:54.978
Are you serious?

14:55.062 --> 14:56.939
You're actually kicking me
out of the band?

14:57.022 --> 15:00.609
Not at all. In fact, I think
you and I should kick Stewie out.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.111
- And I'll take his place.
- What?

15:03.195 --> 15:04.863
Bring out the snakes!

15:04.947 --> 15:06.865
Does he just come to all of our shows?

15:13.830 --> 15:17.751
So, you wanna fire Stewie,
and be Red Shirt Blue Shirt with me?

15:17.835 --> 15:21.213
Absolutely! You're the whole reason
the fans even like the band.

15:21.296 --> 15:22.923
Kids love dogs!

15:23.006 --> 15:25.384
Besides, we've both seen
what Stewie's become.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.177
An impossible diva.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.887
Yeah, but he's my friend.

15:28.971 --> 15:32.933
Yeah, well, your <i>friend</i> has been talking
about kicking you out of the band.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.060
Wait, what? He has?

15:35.143 --> 15:36.812
And I don't know if you considered this,

15:36.895 --> 15:39.314
but the clock is ticking
on Stewie's cuteness.

15:39.398 --> 15:41.066
Huh, I guess you're right.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.818
And I wouldn't be surprised
if he ends up looking like

15:42.901 --> 15:44.820
an exact mash-up of Lois and Peter.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.323
Groceries.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.743
Hey, I had a thought
about our costumes for today's show.

15:51.827 --> 15:54.121
I could wear a shirt that's both
red and blue,

15:54.204 --> 15:56.415
and you can do spin art
with all the wussie kids

15:56.498 --> 15:57.958
who are afraid to go on rides.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.419
Yeah? Well, how about this, Stewie?
You're fired!

16:00.502 --> 16:01.628
- Pardon?
- That's right.

16:01.712 --> 16:03.463
Olivia's takin' your place in the band.

16:03.547 --> 16:06.175
You are looking at the new
Red Shirt Blue Shirt.

16:06.258 --> 16:08.969
What the dude! Ah, you know what?
"Deuce" was right.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.180
Come on, Brian,
you and I should probably rehearse.

16:11.263 --> 16:12.764
We've got a show in 20 minutes.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.642
Fine! Go ahead! It's not gonna
be the same!

16:15.726 --> 16:18.604
Like <i>Cheers</i> wasn't the same
when they brought in Kirstie Alley.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.606
Norm!

16:20.689 --> 16:22.691
No, I'm... I'm Rebecca.

16:28.864 --> 16:30.949
Meg, do you know
how to use Microsoft Excel?

16:31.033 --> 16:32.451
Yeah, I'm actually pretty good.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.161
Yeah, you would! Dork!

16:35.704 --> 16:38.248
But, I do need to make that spreadsheet
or I'm fired.

16:39.666 --> 16:40.792
Oh, my God!

16:40.876 --> 16:43.337
Peter, our dishwasher is full of sex toys.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.672
Oh, yeah. Chris put those in there.
It's for his job.

16:45.756 --> 16:47.090
He's working for Quagmire now.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.927
He's washing sex toys for Quagmire?

16:50.010 --> 16:52.804
Not just that, he also takes pictures
of Quagmire's genitals

16:52.888 --> 16:54.306
to track sore growth.

16:54.389 --> 16:56.266
So, brace yourself when you open iPhoto.

16:56.350 --> 16:57.809
It's on the Griffin family account.

16:57.893 --> 17:00.062
Peter, my parents have access to that.

17:01.146 --> 17:02.564
What's wrong with this worm?

17:03.023 --> 17:04.650
And you knew about this?

17:04.733 --> 17:07.319
How could you let him
do this disgusting stuff?

17:07.402 --> 17:09.613
What? You're the one
who wanted Chris to get a job.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.199
Yeah, like mowing lawns
or trimming bushes.

17:12.282 --> 17:13.575
Oh, he's doing one of those.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.161
That's it!

17:16.245 --> 17:18.747
I'm calling Quagmire right now
and puttin' an end to this.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.628
<i>You have reached Glenn Quagmire.</i>

17:24.711 --> 17:26.839
<i>Neither he nor his assistant is available.</i>

17:26.922 --> 17:29.091
<i>To schedule a liaison, press one.</i>

17:29.174 --> 17:31.510
<i>To cancel a liaison, press two.</i>

17:31.593 --> 17:33.303
<i>If you're calling to report a pregnancy,</i>

17:33.387 --> 17:37.224
<i>please fill out our online form</i>
<i>and we will mail you a check for $180.</i>

17:37.307 --> 17:39.643
<i>- Thank you and have a giggity day.</i>

17:39.726 --> 17:41.186
Chris, this is your mother.

17:41.270 --> 17:43.730
Get these dildos out of the dishwasher.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.616
<i>When everybody's gone to sleep</i>

17:54.700 --> 17:56.535
<i>And you've said, "Good night, moon"</i>

17:56.618 --> 18:00.497
<i>There's plenty of noise still comin'</i>
<i>from Mommy and Daddy's room</i>

18:00.581 --> 18:03.083
<i>Oh, Daddy says, "Please"</i>
<i>Mommy says, "No"</i>

18:03.166 --> 18:05.127
<i>Daddy says, "Come on"</i>
<i>Mommy says, "Whoa!"</i>

18:05.210 --> 18:07.254
<i>Daddy goes, "Ungh!"</i>
<i>Mommy goes, "Ow!"</i>

18:07.337 --> 18:09.298
<i>Daddy says, "I'm done"</i>
<i>Mommy goes, "Wow"</i>

18:09.381 --> 18:11.216
<i>Daddy rolls over and falls asleep</i>

18:11.300 --> 18:12.968
<i>Mommy drinks wine in the dark</i>

18:13.468 --> 18:15.637
<i>- Thank you, Quahog!</i>

18:17.848 --> 18:19.725
That was great! They loved us!

18:19.808 --> 18:22.269
Yeah, I guess, but, did you
see what I saw?

18:22.352 --> 18:25.230
That kid with the cane? Yeah.
What do you think is wrong with him?

18:25.314 --> 18:26.899
No, Stewie was out there.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.734
- So?
- So...

18:28.817 --> 18:30.819
We're singing a song he wrote.

18:30.903 --> 18:32.487
This whole thing was his idea.

18:32.571 --> 18:34.198
Brian, don't mess this up.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.908
We've got a good thing going.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.284
I hate to tell you this,

18:37.367 --> 18:39.578
but I'm afraid Red Shirt Blue Shirt
is done.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.163
I can't do this. I'm out.

18:41.246 --> 18:42.998
I don't care. I don't need you!

18:43.081 --> 18:46.210
I can get 100 dogs
to fit that stupid blue shirt.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.503
You're a monster!

18:47.586 --> 18:50.130
Like Frankenstein
when he became a loan officer.

18:50.339 --> 18:52.841
So, I'm looking for money
to open a small business.

18:52.925 --> 18:55.928
- We plan to sell antique lamps.
- Mmm.

18:56.011 --> 18:58.388
- Handmade blankets.
- Mmm!

18:58.472 --> 18:59.598
And pitchforks.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.399
Chris, there you are. We need to talk.

19:09.483 --> 19:10.943
What, are you walking a horse?

19:11.026 --> 19:12.319
Did Quagmire get a horse?

19:12.402 --> 19:13.779
Oh, no, here we go.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.030
I want a horse!

19:15.113 --> 19:16.615
Peter, it's not a horse.

19:16.698 --> 19:18.283
Chris, what the hell is that?

19:18.367 --> 19:20.911
Oh, this is Mr. Quagmire's horse gimp.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.329
What is a horse gimp?

19:22.412 --> 19:23.539
It's a sexual fetishist

19:23.622 --> 19:24.706
who derives erotic pleasure

19:24.790 --> 19:26.834
from dressing in horse-themed
leather gear.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.627
You wanna see me feed him a carrot?

19:28.710 --> 19:30.212
- Absolutely not.
- Hell yes.

19:30.379 --> 19:32.589
Chris, this is no job for a teenage boy.

19:32.673 --> 19:34.341
You have to quit right now.

19:34.716 --> 19:37.386
I can't quit.
I'm actually good at this job.

19:37.469 --> 19:39.096
Plus, I'm making decent money.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.764
You could
work at the pharmacy.

19:40.848 --> 19:42.558
- Quite, Triscuit!
- Ooh!

19:42.641 --> 19:44.059
Hook me to the plow.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.979
Chris, I have $1,100
in a pink can in the garage.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.856
Just take that
and we'll never speak of this again.

19:48.939 --> 19:51.567
- Okay.
- Great, now let's all go home.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.654
Well, that's what I get
for horsing around.

19:57.155 --> 19:58.991
Ah, your joke wasn't funny enough.

20:05.289 --> 20:07.249
- Stewie?
- Oh, hello, Brian.

20:07.666 --> 20:11.170
I'm here to apologize,
and to let you know I quit the band.

20:11.253 --> 20:12.254
You did?

20:12.337 --> 20:14.298
Yes. It's nothing without you.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.757
You were the band.

20:15.841 --> 20:17.342
Those were your songs.

20:17.718 --> 20:20.095
And I'm sorry if I let Olivia
manipulate me.

20:20.512 --> 20:22.931
I guess she manipulated
both of us.

20:23.015 --> 20:26.268
There's just something
about her flat chest and muscular legs.

20:26.685 --> 20:29.271
Look, I never should have
treated you the way I did.

20:29.855 --> 20:32.107
I suppose I didn't treat you
so well either.

20:32.191 --> 20:33.483
So what do you say?

20:33.567 --> 20:36.111
Can we put this all behind us
and go back to the way things were?

20:36.195 --> 20:37.613
Of course we can.

20:37.696 --> 20:39.615
Hey, I wonder if she's gonna keep
the band going.

20:39.698 --> 20:43.035
Probably. She told me she was just
gonna replace me with another dog.

20:43.118 --> 20:44.703
- Yes, but who?
- I don't know.

20:44.786 --> 20:47.039
Probably some dog
neither you or I have ever met.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.960
<i>All right, listen up,</i>
<i>you little pieces of garbage.</i>

20:52.044 --> 20:54.505
<i>This song's about getting heartburn</i>
<i>from baked clams,</i>

20:54.630 --> 20:56.048
<i>and other kid stuff.</i>
