00:10.143 --> 00:12.879
What the hell
is gonna happen this time?

00:12.946 --> 00:15.849
Geordie Tours. Where?
Across Europe. (cheering)

00:17.317 --> 00:20.520

stays on tour.

00:20.587 --> 00:23.690
Bring on the fucking carnage.
Fuck off!

00:23.757 --> 00:26.626
I want you to leave
until further notice.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.828
Hi again.
Charlotte's back

00:28.895 --> 00:30.163
I love you.

00:30.230 --> 00:33.600
I'm just another girl
who's fell in love with Gary.

00:33.666 --> 00:36.302
I have to deal
with the Ricci situation.

00:36.369 --> 00:40.573
We just need to be on our own.
I think this is it. (cries)

00:40.640 --> 00:43.042
Military bootcamp
is my idea of heaven.

00:43.109 --> 00:46.379
Captain Cock-Sucker
here to suck you off. See me later.

00:46.446 --> 00:49.282
It's time to have
a proper house party.

00:49.349 --> 00:51.050
Fuck knows what'll happen.

00:51.117 --> 00:54.087
We are knee deep in clunge,
it's fucking ridiculous.

00:54.154 --> 00:57.924
I am standing there looking like
an absolute wanker.

00:57.991 --> 01:00.460
(shouting)

01:00.527 --> 01:03.096
Fuck off!
Arrgghh!

01:03.163 --> 01:05.265
Everyone's pure kicking off.
Fuck!

01:05.331 --> 01:08.802
I hope he's gone forever.
I don't wanna see him again.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.705
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:12.772 --> 01:14.974
I'm a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:15.041 --> 01:17.277
If you look up pulling,
my name's there.

01:17.343 --> 01:19.446
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:19.512 --> 01:21.347
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:21.414 --> 01:25.285
I could talk the legs off a donkey.
Got the looks, the charm.

01:25.351 --> 01:27.987
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:28.054 --> 01:30.023

01:46.105 --> 01:48.808
The house party was a pure disaster.

01:48.875 --> 01:53.413
Charlotte and Gary had a massive
row and once again he stormed off,

01:53.480 --> 01:56.216
leaving her to cry her eyes out.

01:56.282 --> 01:59.686
Gary's left us with a broken heart,
a broken foot.

01:59.752 --> 02:03.523
I don't think I'll ever get over
what he's done this time.

02:03.590 --> 02:08.461
Too be fair, last night
just got totally out of hand.

02:08.527 --> 02:10.196

02:12.265 --> 02:13.366
Hello.

02:15.134 --> 02:16.269
Morning.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.973
Erm, yeah, two seconds.

02:20.039 --> 02:24.010
Anna's on the blower for Charlotte.
I reckon it's about last night.

02:25.411 --> 02:28.248
Charlotte just went too far
this time like.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.584
I reckon Anna
is gonna be fucking foaming.

02:34.387 --> 02:35.488
Hi, Anna.

02:42.629 --> 02:43.696
I know.

02:43.763 --> 02:47.600
It was wrong but Anna doesn't know
how much of a dick Gary was being.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.240
OK, bye.
Bye.

02:55.375 --> 02:59.245
I can't believe
I've been kicked out. I never ever

02:59.312 --> 03:01.347
wanna see Gary again

03:01.414 --> 03:06.119
So Charlotte's gotta go and we don't
know whether she's gonna come back.

03:06.185 --> 03:09.255
I'm gutted
that it's had to come down to this.

03:13.092 --> 03:15.562
Yeah.
I am so fucking angry

03:15.628 --> 03:19.332
that my best friend has to leave
for something Gary has done.

03:19.399 --> 03:23.803
At the minute if Gaz and Charlotte
would rip each other's head off.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.439
Go on, Dan, you get the heavy one.

03:26.506 --> 03:28.608
Oh, God, right.

03:28.675 --> 03:30.810
I know Charlotte's leaving

03:30.877 --> 03:34.380
but I can't go and say goodbye.
I can't talk to her

03:34.447 --> 03:36.749
at the minute.
See you, everyone.

03:36.816 --> 03:38.384
I love you.
Bye.

03:38.451 --> 03:40.653
Go on!

03:40.720 --> 03:42.689
We can see your arsehole.
Oh, man.

03:42.755 --> 03:45.325
Bye. Bye.
See you.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.928
This might be the last time
I see Charlotte for ages.

03:56.536 --> 04:00.039
There's 35-40 girls, five lads,
what am I meant to do?

04:00.106 --> 04:03.209
Lock meself in a cupboard?
She needs to understand

04:03.276 --> 04:04.844
you don't feel the same.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.146
It's like he's done nothing wrong.

04:07.213 --> 04:11.317
It's hard to live with someone
that's took our friend away from us.

04:11.384 --> 04:15.722
There's a massive divide and I don't
wanna to be in the same room as Gary

04:15.788 --> 04:19.492
especially with that diseased,
rotten falling-to-bits parsnip.

04:19.559 --> 04:22.662
Ricci's left,
now Charlotte's gone as well.

04:22.729 --> 04:25.598
I don't know
how much more I can take.

04:25.665 --> 04:28.468
You shouldn't have
brought that girl upstairs.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.342
Oh, great.

04:36.409 --> 04:39.479
The only thing that'd make them happy
is stringing me up,

04:39.545 --> 04:42.115
chopping me dick off.
What am I supposed to do?

04:44.884 --> 04:48.721
Scramble, Egg and Toast
now have no mother.

04:50.056 --> 04:51.691
That's the term.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.159
It's in the dictionary.

04:53.226 --> 04:56.696
That should be taken out, that's
surely not politically correct.

04:56.763 --> 05:01.567
I hope that Charlotte comes back
cos it's not the same without her.

05:04.504 --> 05:06.005
Yeah.

Hi. Hi, it's Scotty.

05:19.252 --> 05:23.523
Anna's had us all over Europe
taking care of hen and stag do's.

05:23.589 --> 05:25.358
I wonder where this time.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.762
Shut up, man. That's pure wicked.

05:29.829 --> 05:34.634
Fucking wicked. Hopefully this will
take everyone's mind off Charlotte.

05:36.069 --> 05:39.839
What's the score?
Guess where we're going? Where?

05:39.906 --> 05:44.143
French Alps. Is it?
Aye, skiing.

05:44.210 --> 05:49.015
Skiing is fucking amazing but with
Charlotte not here it'll be weird.

05:50.116 --> 05:51.718
Hello.

05:51.784 --> 05:54.821
Scott walks in,
what the fuck does he want now?

05:54.887 --> 05:58.658
We're gaaning to the French Alps.
No way. Aye, skiing.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.426
It should be good news,

06:00.493 --> 06:04.397
but all I can think about is the
fact that Ricci won't be there

06:04.464 --> 06:08.468
and Charlotte won't be there
and that takes the shine off it.

06:10.470 --> 06:14.841
I get what you're doing, Holly. I've
used this technique all the time.

06:14.907 --> 06:19.145
The one thing I've always wanted
to tick off the list is skiing.

06:19.212 --> 06:23.282
Perfect comb over tick,
wicked bird tick, unreal skier

06:23.349 --> 06:25.318
about to be ticked.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.724
I hope them French Alps are ready
cos the Geordies are coming.

06:34.761 --> 06:38.264
The snow, mountains,
it's absolutely freezing.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.467

somewhere colder than Newcastle.

pretty fucking decent

06:53.312 --> 06:55.581

06:55.648 --> 06:57.650
Oh, they've got us bunk-beds.

06:57.717 --> 07:01.387
Fucking no chance am I staying
in bunk-beds, unlucky Dan.

07:01.454 --> 07:05.458
Bunk-beds, this is so exciting.
I'll have the top bunk.

07:05.525 --> 07:08.227
Is this the living room?
Oh, wow. (gasps)

07:08.294 --> 07:10.463
It's exactly
what I would've expected

07:10.530 --> 07:13.933
from a skiing holiday, it's so cosy,
there's an open fire.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.002
It's cute up here.

07:17.870 --> 07:20.406
We're getting the best rooms.

07:20.473 --> 07:24.477
Should girls have the upstairs?
Yeah. I need a room for meself.

07:24.544 --> 07:28.581
The others don't know but I've
invited Joel to come tomorrow.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.716
Girls are taking the upstairs.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.418
No.
Yeah.

07:32.485 --> 07:35.721
You've got the double beds.
We haven't. Lads can't spoon.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.124
The girls are upstairs
with the best rooms

07:38.191 --> 07:40.827
and boys are downstairs
with the shit ones.

07:40.893 --> 07:45.398
Not that it matters to Scott and Gaz
cos they love sucking each other off

07:45.464 --> 07:48.334
Upstairs is nice, isn't it?
We're having it. Bagsie.

07:48.401 --> 07:53.673
We might be in the French Alps but
the boy girl divide came with us.

07:57.844 --> 07:58.845

07:58.911 --> 08:02.248
All right, girls, girls.

balcony and freeze your bollocks off,

08:07.253 --> 08:08.521

08:21.968 --> 08:23.970

How you feeling about it though?

08:35.147 --> 08:37.783
These trips,
me and Charlotte have done something.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.852
In Amsterdam we got back together,

08:39.919 --> 08:43.589
in Prague she looked after us
and we spent every night together,

08:43.655 --> 08:45.725
in Barcelona she said she loved us.

08:45.791 --> 08:48.361
And now I'm skiing without her.
It's shit.

08:48.427 --> 08:53.065
Why should I be out banging birds
when she's not even here?

08:53.132 --> 08:57.136
Gaz is saying he doesn't feel right
pulling cos Charlotte's not here.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.706
He needs to wind his neck in.
It's the perfect opportunity.

09:00.773 --> 09:05.177
Girls, we'll see you at the bar.
What, are you not waiting for us?

09:05.244 --> 09:09.181
The boys have gone ahead without us,
what a bunch of pricks.

09:09.248 --> 09:12.385

to make the best of a bad situation.

but I want us to have a good time.

Charlotte and how he's treated her

to get dusted on an Alp. Obviously.

15:10.309 --> 15:14.380
I'm hoping the instructors are fit
cos if they are my day'll be made.

15:14.446 --> 15:17.449
Are you here for skiing?
(all) Yeah. Good.

15:17.516 --> 15:19.852
The ski instructors
look like porn stars,

15:19.918 --> 15:23.722
one of them has the biggest
moustache I've seen in me life.

15:25.224 --> 15:30.062
He's gonna come round, fix me boiler
and bend us over the washer.

15:30.129 --> 15:33.065
That's what French people find
attractive. What moustaches? Yeah.

15:33.132 --> 15:37.936
The instructors want to see us go
one at a time. Holly's up first.

15:38.003 --> 15:41.573
No please, I don't want to.
Oh, no. God.

15:41.640 --> 15:45.244
I don't understand why people
put effort into going to the top

15:45.311 --> 15:46.779
and throwing themselves off?

15:46.845 --> 15:48.781
I'm scared of weather.

15:48.847 --> 15:52.251
Why is all this snow here
and what's under the snow?

15:52.318 --> 15:54.586
Oh, my God, I'm going backwards.

15:54.653 --> 15:59.058
I've never been skiing but you can
spot a shit skier a mile off.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.527
I don't know how to stop. Argh!

16:01.593 --> 16:03.495
(screams) Help!

16:03.562 --> 16:06.332
As predicted
Holly is the ultimate worst.

16:06.398 --> 16:10.969
(screams) I don't like it!
I don't know how to stop.

16:11.036 --> 16:14.340
I... fucking... hate... skiing.

16:14.406 --> 16:18.911
It's Vicky's turn to go down
and you can tell she's still rough.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.283
I am still drunk, absolutely mortal.
Only good thing is

16:24.350 --> 16:26.518
I say I'm pissed on the piste.

16:26.585 --> 16:30.889
Vicky and Holly are fucking shit.
It's time to show them how it's done.

16:30.956 --> 16:33.759
Clearly, I'm the best.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.229
Skiing, shock,
has turned into just another

16:37.296 --> 16:39.531
massive dick measuring competition.

16:39.598 --> 16:43.369
It's like everything else,
I'm proper mint at it.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.574
It's hard to look good with this
many layers on but, somehow,

16:48.640 --> 16:50.709
yet again, I've pulled it off.

16:50.776 --> 16:52.478
This is fucking mad.

16:52.544 --> 16:57.116
Dan is shit at it.
He's got all the gear but no idea.

17:00.119 --> 17:02.454
# "Bom Bom" - Sam And The Womp

17:02.521 --> 17:07.092
So, you put the pole between
your legs? Yeah, I can do that.

17:07.159 --> 17:11.329
# "Bom Bom" - Sam And The Womp

17:11.396 --> 17:13.999
I'm absolutely gutted
Charlotte's not skiing.

17:14.066 --> 17:17.869
Imagine the whole place
being full of yellow snow.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.373
Yeah, bitches!

17:22.840 --> 17:28.046
Hey, you were fantasti. For your
first morning, you skied very well.

17:28.113 --> 17:29.948
Thank fuck that's over.

17:30.015 --> 17:32.418
(cheering)

17:32.484 --> 17:35.421
I've heard going skiing
isn't about skiing,

17:35.487 --> 17:40.292
it's about apres skiing, meaning you
get pissed after being on the piste.

17:40.359 --> 17:42.761
(all cheer)
Yeah!

17:42.828 --> 17:47.299
I knew I was never gonna be good
at the skiing thing but this bit

17:47.366 --> 17:49.668
I'm gonna be really, really good at.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.905
So we're all getting pissed
and I'm thinking,

17:52.971 --> 17:56.208
"What the hell? Where's Joel?"
He's supposed to be here.

17:57.643 --> 18:03.081
Hi, Joel. Hi. Nice to see you.
I didn't expect you to come here.

18:03.148 --> 18:07.686
Can you imagine my fucking disgust
when in walks Joel

18:07.753 --> 18:11.423
and ruins my fucking apres ski?
Apres prick!

18:13.225 --> 18:15.828
What the fuck is Joel doing here?

18:15.894 --> 18:19.198
If anyone should be surprising us
it should've been Charlotte.

18:23.035 --> 18:26.839
We're back from apres ski I'm lining
my stomach with ham sandwiches

18:26.905 --> 18:28.574
ready for tonight's antics.

18:31.443 --> 18:36.081
You forget we're not here to enjoy
ourselves we're here to fucking work.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.756
We won't touch any girls.

18:44.823 --> 18:47.893
Anna says it's a bar crawl,
that give me an idea.

18:49.361 --> 18:52.364
Joel's a tit, tonight I'm giving him
one last chance

18:52.431 --> 18:54.833
to prove himself with the lads.

18:57.836 --> 19:00.305
It'll be the hardest graft
he's done.

19:00.372 --> 19:04.376
He's used to putting a CD in,
pressing a button that goes DJ Joel.

19:04.443 --> 19:05.878
What the hell?

19:05.944 --> 19:08.247
Why does Anna want Joel to work?

19:08.313 --> 19:11.016
Look after him.
We will. No, we won't.

19:11.083 --> 19:15.220
Joel better behave on this bar crawl
especially with the Buck Squad.

19:15.287 --> 19:18.423
Alreet? We're getting pissed.
He's allowed, you're not his mam.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.292
You're coming with Gaz.

19:20.359 --> 19:25.864
# "All I Know" - Fenech-Soler

19:25.931 --> 19:30.802
So we arrive at the bar crawl and
the place is rammed with posh fanny.

19:30.869 --> 19:34.306
Would you like some cheese
and wine with your cock?

19:34.373 --> 19:36.174
(cheering)

19:36.241 --> 19:40.145
Posh hens in the Alps, they won't
know what fucking hit them.

19:40.212 --> 19:43.215
"I'm not posh." Oh, my God.
I'm not.

19:43.282 --> 19:45.884
(posh accent)
"I'm working in a ski resort."

19:48.754 --> 19:50.455
Joel isn't pissed enough yet.

19:50.522 --> 19:54.293
I want to get him that smashed
that he's dribbling in the next bar.

19:58.830 --> 20:02.568
Everyone's pondering the subject
of why Joel's been sent to work.

20:02.634 --> 20:04.937
To be honest,
I couldn't give a fuck.

20:05.003 --> 20:07.973
Gary fucking walked in the room
and was like,

20:08.040 --> 20:12.244
"Aye, we're going to work, Joel.
Anna said you've got to come."

20:12.311 --> 20:15.414
Joel was like, "Oh, OK, yeah."

20:15.480 --> 20:20.686
So what, Gary's said that Anna's said
that he has to take Joel to work.

20:20.752 --> 20:22.688
That's got to be a joke.

20:25.824 --> 20:30.362
I know they don't like Joel. I hope
they're not giving him a hard time.

20:30.429 --> 20:34.333
(cheering)
We're trying to get Joel smashed.

20:36.969 --> 20:41.640
I've got the bar chanting his name,
there's no way he can back down.

20:41.707 --> 20:43.208
Get it in.

20:48.647 --> 20:52.517
We always banter Joel hard.
To be fair, the kid takes it well.

20:55.721 --> 20:58.857
Me and Dan are cracking on
with a couple of birds

20:58.924 --> 21:02.361
and Gaz is on his best behaviour.
I'm actually surprised.

21:02.427 --> 21:06.898
I'm cracking on with this bird and
normally I would've pulled by now.

21:06.965 --> 21:10.636
But I can't because Charlotte's
not here, it doesn't feel right.

21:12.804 --> 21:18.143
Dan is absolutely smashed again.
I thought it would've been Joel

21:18.210 --> 21:21.546
but he's been sound. Unlike
fucking Tintin, the little wanker.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.815
See you later on.

21:23.882 --> 21:25.684
Whoo!

21:25.751 --> 21:30.889
Finish work, back to the house
and I am absolutely wasted.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.825
Girls. (whistles) We're back.

21:37.929 --> 21:40.932
My boobs are looking fucking amazing
in the Alps.

21:40.999 --> 21:44.403
If I move here,
I won't have to get another boob job.

21:45.871 --> 21:50.542
Where's Dan? He's having a shit,
no a wee. Dan finish your wee-wee.

21:50.609 --> 21:54.946
Last night was incredible, today's
been unreal. I've got high hopes.

21:55.013 --> 21:57.916
It's minus three
but we're Geordie Shore girls

21:57.983 --> 22:01.186
so it's six-inch heels
and short skirts all round.

22:01.253 --> 22:02.254
Oh, man!

22:02.320 --> 22:09.161
# "Clarity" - Zedd feat Foxes

22:13.131 --> 22:17.669
It's our second night out and I've
got Joel, how perfect can this be?

22:22.908 --> 22:26.211
Joel says he's bonded with the boys,
I hope that's true.

22:38.924 --> 22:40.726
This is all I've ever wanted.

22:40.792 --> 22:44.262
I'm glad they've finally realised
that Joel's a nice lad.

Everyone's getting on everyone's
having shots, everyone's dancing,

22:55.373 --> 22:57.209
we're actually all together again.

23:00.212 --> 23:03.882
Tonight is mint and even James
is being a bit friendly,

23:03.949 --> 23:05.484
must be the altitude.

23:08.086 --> 23:10.589
Are the girls daft
wanting a dance-off?

23:10.655 --> 23:12.524
We'll wipe the floor with them.

23:17.629 --> 23:21.066
I'm having a such a good time
and I slut drop,

23:21.133 --> 23:24.369
I'm like, "Shit, me skirt's ripped
all the way up."

23:28.640 --> 23:33.178
I really hope that my arse
isn't completely hanging out.

23:33.245 --> 23:38.116
I am absolutely mortal. I have not
been this drunk in a long long time.

23:41.920 --> 23:46.925
Dan is smashed, he's talking shit.
Not bringing anyone home tonight.

23:46.992 --> 23:51.029
I reckon he's gonna end up
like Gaz in Prague with his head

23:51.096 --> 23:52.931
down the fucking toilet.

23:54.566 --> 23:58.703
Not long ago I wasn't talking
to the girls, I was getting blanked,

23:58.770 --> 24:01.973
now I'm carrying them to taxis.
How does that work?

24:02.040 --> 24:07.145
Dan's asking for it. Having a wee
in the snow with his pants

24:07.212 --> 24:09.047
round his ankles.

24:11.483 --> 24:13.285
Hash tag shrivel dick.

24:18.423 --> 24:23.595
So we all get back to chalet
and Dan is fucking mortal.

24:28.934 --> 24:31.870
Dan's gonna be hanging out
his fucking arse tomorrow.

24:35.774 --> 24:38.677
Man up, Dan,
we're going down the slopes.

24:38.743 --> 24:40.679
I'm gonna spew everywhere.

24:40.745 --> 24:42.013
Canny nice horses.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.283
Why's all the horses
shitting all over the place?

24:45.350 --> 24:47.786
This is fucking paradise

24:47.853 --> 24:49.921
I'm not flirting, for God's sake.

It's our second morning
in the Alps and we're going skiing

25:22.187 --> 25:25.523
but I'm knackered. I didn't get
a fucking wink of sleep.

25:25.590 --> 25:28.260
I hope you've had
a fucking nice sleep.

25:28.326 --> 25:33.098
Dan farted and snored all night.
You snore like a fucking wildebeest.

25:33.164 --> 25:37.736
I need some water and a sandwich
and I'm fucking laughing.

25:37.802 --> 25:42.107
I've heard the best cure for a
hangover is fresh French Alps air.

Man up, Dan,
we're going down the slopes.

26:01.226 --> 26:05.330
Hangover plus skiing
equals disaster.

26:07.632 --> 26:12.470
Only one place for me, bed. I'm
dragging my arse back to the chalet.

26:15.807 --> 26:19.377
Scott cannot let me
be better at anything.

26:19.444 --> 26:23.114
The kid's like Bambi on fucking
ice. He just can't give up.

26:26.251 --> 26:31.456
While Scott and Gaz go to suck each
other off, we're off horse riding.

26:36.494 --> 26:39.064
You have some canny nice horses.

26:39.130 --> 26:40.732
(all) Yeah.

26:42.233 --> 26:44.469
Does it have a pouch for me drink?

26:44.536 --> 26:47.806
Why's all the horses
shitting all over the place?

26:47.872 --> 26:50.408
Oh, my God.
I'm trying to get on.

26:50.475 --> 26:54.279
I can normally open my legs wide but
in these trousers it's not possible.

26:54.346 --> 26:57.816
I don't think Holly's cut out
for life outside Newcastle,

26:57.882 --> 27:00.285
she cannot ski,
she cannot horse ride.

27:00.352 --> 27:03.888
She can't do physical activities,
apart from sucking people off.

27:03.955 --> 27:06.825
I'm really, really struggling
to get on this horse

27:06.891 --> 27:10.261
so this horsey man gets me
a step ladder. Perfect.

27:10.328 --> 27:12.864
Whoa, chill out, bruv.

27:16.634 --> 27:20.438
Oh, yeah, I'm riding,
I'm riding, I'm riding.

27:20.505 --> 27:24.342
On this horse, the trotting
is giving me a really weird feeling

27:24.409 --> 27:26.578
in my fairy and I'm thinking,

27:26.644 --> 27:31.616
"I don't know what to do, I'm sat on
a horse and getting really horny."

27:31.683 --> 27:34.319
I thought the girls would be better,

27:34.386 --> 27:37.055
the amount of experience
they've had riding.

27:45.230 --> 27:49.367
Put your leg over the back
of the horse and just slide off.

27:49.434 --> 27:53.438
I can't get off the horse
cos the man hasn't brought the steps.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.808
James is holding this horse,
I'm thinking, "Why's he being nice?"

27:56.875 --> 28:00.979
Now jump. Oh, God, I've just
actually hit that one in the face.

28:01.046 --> 28:05.450
Now is the perfect time to clear
the air with James once and for all.

28:05.517 --> 28:10.088
I don't want to leave things
on, like, bad terms or anything.

28:10.155 --> 28:13.925
Holly just wants to make sure
that everything's fine between us.

28:13.992 --> 28:16.761
I don't wanna leave
on bad terms either.

28:16.828 --> 28:19.964
When I spoke to you last time
on the bus

28:20.031 --> 28:22.500
I thought that we could move on

28:22.567 --> 28:25.770
I was angry
and I didn't want to be friends

28:25.837 --> 28:27.906
because of the way you'd treat us.

28:27.972 --> 28:31.876
It does get me down thinking
that we used to be friends

28:31.943 --> 28:34.145
and we won't ever have that again.

28:34.212 --> 28:37.882
There's only a couple of days left,
we've both had our reasons.

28:37.949 --> 28:41.486
We'll be mature about it
and everyone leave on a high.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.889
I'm glad we've cleared the air
and we're not gonna

28:44.956 --> 28:46.691
be leaving on bad terms.

28:46.758 --> 28:49.360
Oh, fuck.

28:49.427 --> 28:54.365
I'm not flirting, don't even go
anywhere near that word ever again.

28:57.168 --> 28:59.904
I haven't heard from Dan all day

28:59.971 --> 29:02.974
so I'm just gonna
make sure he's not dying

29:03.041 --> 29:04.776
from alcohol poisoning or shame.

29:04.843 --> 29:07.178
Have you suffered today?
Yeah, man.

29:07.245 --> 29:11.082
I was trying to put a brave face on
but I couldn't.

29:11.149 --> 29:16.254
I'm so angry at myself for
everything that I've missed out on.

29:16.321 --> 29:21.159
Get some rest. Me and the girls
are off to see a man about an igloo.

29:21.226 --> 29:24.662
I've tried a number of times
to educate these girls,

29:24.729 --> 29:28.199
to introduce a bit of culture
and I have failed miserable

29:28.266 --> 29:31.503
cos they won't drink anything
other than vodka or cum.

29:31.569 --> 29:35.340
I'm taking them fucking wine tasting
whether they like it or not

29:35.406 --> 29:37.609
and I'm taking them in an igloo.

29:37.675 --> 29:42.814
I hate wine, I hate cold. Well, I
like cold I just don't like Eskimos.

29:42.881 --> 29:45.316
There is no Eskimos.
What's wrong with Eskimos?

29:45.383 --> 29:48.386
They're just fucking weird, man.
Eskimos are make-believe.

29:49.787 --> 29:51.856
No, they're not.
Yes, they are.

29:51.923 --> 29:56.861
They're not. My God, please tell me
we're not having this conversation.

29:56.928 --> 30:01.533
What the fuck? What do they teach
kids in Middlesbrough schools?

30:01.599 --> 30:04.869
Fucking blowjobs,
that's what they teach them.

# "Can You hear Me?"
- Wiley feat Skepta &amp; JME &amp; Ms D

30:10.808 --> 30:13.912
Oh, my God, it's amazing.

30:15.513 --> 30:20.985
I'm not scared cos it doesn't look
older than a night out in Newcastle.

30:21.052 --> 30:23.855
A very nice igloo.
Thank you very much.

30:23.922 --> 30:27.692
I thought Eskimos lived in igloos,
not some tall posh boy.

30:27.759 --> 30:31.496
What if someone jumped on it?
You could park a car on it.

30:31.563 --> 30:32.730
Shut up, man.
Cheers.

30:32.797 --> 30:36.734
I'm sitting in an igloo, drinking
fine wines and educating the girls

30:36.801 --> 30:38.436
about the French revolution.

30:38.503 --> 30:41.573
A little bit of information about
this glass that you've got here.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.975
Marie Antoinette,
the last queen of France,

30:44.042 --> 30:47.478
had this type of glass
moulded on her left breast

30:47.545 --> 30:50.381
and gave it to Louie the 16th.
What?

30:50.448 --> 30:52.884
She's got a canny flat tit.

30:52.951 --> 30:56.888
Imagine if someone made
a glass mould out of my tits.

30:56.955 --> 30:59.457
Mine would be like this.
Like the taste?

30:59.524 --> 31:03.895
You'd have to give them a champagne
bucket. I think it's really nice.

31:03.962 --> 31:09.100
I'm more of a vodka person. I'm the
only one who appreciates the wine.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.803
Ooh, a rose.
You like a rose? I do.

31:11.869 --> 31:16.507
Vicky loves wine.
If we do anything that involves wine,

31:16.574 --> 31:18.543
she is always the one mortal.

31:19.544 --> 31:20.645
Whey-aye.

31:20.712 --> 31:24.349
Wine tasting over, I'm smashed.
Fucking buzzing.

31:26.651 --> 31:29.721
After a long day,
me and Scott head to the hotel

31:29.787 --> 31:34.225
and we find this little hidden gem.
An outdoor heated pool, it's amazing.

31:38.963 --> 31:40.898
It's like Ibiza in the snow.

31:40.965 --> 31:44.936
It's a shame that Ricci couldn't
join us but Joel's been sound.

31:49.841 --> 31:53.611
This is the perfect way
to end a perfect trip.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.751
It's been really good, hasn't it?

32:05.990 --> 32:10.628
Right now me and Joel are destroying
the Geordie Shore relationship curse

32:10.695 --> 32:15.600
It pains us to say that Joel is
growing on me as a human being.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.036
I'm so disappointed in meself.

32:19.270 --> 32:23.174
Skiing was an amazing way to end our
time as the Geordie Shore family.

32:23.241 --> 32:25.243
Best trip I've ever fucking had.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.945
The Alps has been absolutely wicked.

32:28.012 --> 32:32.050
It's time to head back to Newcastle
for one last night of carnage.

32:32.116 --> 32:35.820
It's our last night,
we have to go out with a bang.

32:35.887 --> 32:38.323
(cheering)
I'm gutted it's the last night.

32:38.389 --> 32:40.692
You're the reason
my best friend isn't here.

32:40.758 --> 32:42.960
I thought we were over this.
Fucking knob.

32:43.027 --> 32:45.463
I still don't know if it's the end.

32:45.530 --> 32:47.665
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye.

32:48.766 --> 32:50.168

33:12.357 --> 33:14.959
# Just get your ass back... #
Home.

33:15.026 --> 33:18.429
We're back and we're all absolutely
knackered off the travelling

33:18.496 --> 33:20.665
but it's our last family night out.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.671
Will you call Ricci?
Aye.

33:27.672 --> 33:30.708
Tonight's the last night
and it won't be the same

33:30.775 --> 33:33.244
unless everyone's there.
I want Ricci there.

33:33.311 --> 33:35.246
I'll ring Ricci,
girls ring Charlotte.

33:35.313 --> 33:38.216
I'm pleased Vicky suggested
getting everyone back together.

33:49.026 --> 33:52.196
One down. I'm dead excited
cos it's been a while

33:52.263 --> 33:54.732
but at the same time
I'm apprehensive.

33:56.067 --> 34:00.037
So Ricci's in and now we've just
got to convince Charlotte too.

34:01.773 --> 34:05.943
Missing you. Come out tonight
with us for our last night. Please.

34:08.446 --> 34:09.547
What?

34:09.614 --> 34:13.083
Oh, I thought Charlotte
was actually gonna come out.

34:13.150 --> 34:17.054
I'm actually really gutted.
What a fucking knob Gary is.

34:20.558 --> 34:24.728
I understand where she's coming from.
It wouldn't be nice for her and Gary

34:24.795 --> 34:29.434
to be in looking distance of each
other. Won't come cos of you, Gaz.

34:29.766 --> 34:33.670
It hasn't been that long. She needs
time get her head round everything.

34:38.842 --> 34:43.614
I am gutted Charlotte's can't come
but Ricci's coming so we'll smash it

35:07.839 --> 35:09.474
Ricci's coming out. Buzzing.

35:14.345 --> 35:19.250
Ricci's not here yet. The longer he
takes, the more nervous I'm getting.

35:19.317 --> 35:22.987
I don't know what's coming over us
but I'm a fucking wreck.

35:27.558 --> 35:30.561
I'm excepting him
to be pleased to see me.

35:30.628 --> 35:35.266
The last thing I'm expecting is
a custard fucking pie in the face.

35:44.041 --> 35:47.979
I look over at Gary
and he's having a mint time

35:48.045 --> 35:51.616
and I think, "You're the reason
my best friend isn't here."

35:55.286 --> 36:00.157
I thought we were over this but she
cannot see it from my point of view.

36:08.966 --> 36:11.035
I can never get through to him.

36:13.571 --> 36:17.842
When she crawls in my bed, I can't
stop that. She's leading herself on.

36:26.350 --> 36:30.988
When I see Vicky she looks gorgeous
and it reminds me of what I've lost.

36:31.055 --> 36:33.024
And that really fucking hurts.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.362
When Ricci comes over
it's so nice to speak to him.

36:41.966 --> 36:45.803
This was the man I was gonna marry,
what a fucking turnaround.

36:54.545 --> 36:58.316
It's great to see Vicky but she's
right we need more time apart.

37:12.830 --> 37:16.400
the last night we've all been through
so much this time

37:16.467 --> 37:18.736
and we need to absolutely smash it.

37:18.803 --> 37:21.572
None of the lads
are arsed about pulling.

37:21.639 --> 37:25.109
It's family night tonight,
we want to celebrate with everyone.

37:25.176 --> 37:28.613
It's took until the final
fucking night for them to realise

37:28.679 --> 37:33.584
that they can just have fun with us
as a family. (cheering) Dicks.

37:35.086 --> 37:38.623
I'm so glad that Ricci came out
for our final night.

37:38.689 --> 37:42.493
He's part of the family, it wouldn't
have been the same without him.

37:42.560 --> 37:46.564
It's such an odd sensation
to say goodbye to Ricci.

37:46.631 --> 37:49.233
Good to see you.
Good to see you too.

37:50.668 --> 37:55.906
I'm gonna have to get used to doing
a lot of things on me own now.

37:57.642 --> 38:01.879
I still don't know if this is the end
or if we're just on a break.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.814
I guess only time will tell.

38:06.317 --> 38:10.054
Last night was unreal,
no drama, no kick-offs.

38:10.121 --> 38:13.758

to them tomorrow.

we're gonna wake up together.

38:53.431 --> 38:57.668
One thing I won't miss is fucking
Holly squealing like a pig,

38:57.735 --> 38:59.837
every single morning
when she's hungover.

38:59.904 --> 39:01.639

39:04.275 --> 39:07.244
This the last time
we're gonna wake up in here.

39:07.311 --> 39:09.380
Thank fuck, it's a fucking tip.

39:09.447 --> 39:12.416
I'm really gonna miss
this bunch of scruffy twats.

39:12.483 --> 39:16.854

39:16.921 --> 39:19.090

# And we will never, ever, ever
Ever leave each other

39:23.561 --> 39:27.431
We've bonded like three brothers
and I'm gonna miss it so much.

39:31.435 --> 39:34.538
I keep looking at the fish,
they need their mam.

39:34.605 --> 39:36.440
I'm gonna take them to Charlotte.

39:36.507 --> 39:41.545
I'm more or less packed so I'm gonna
take Scramble, Egg and fucking Toast.

39:41.612 --> 39:44.081
You're gonna take the fish
to Charlotte's house?

39:44.148 --> 39:48.519
Gary decides he'll take the fish
to Charlotte's. Not a good idea.

39:48.586 --> 39:53.023
Best of luck to get my friend
to answer the door to you.

39:53.090 --> 39:56.861
All Charlotte cares more about than
me and Sophie is them stupid fish.

39:56.927 --> 40:00.197
So for once I'm gonna try
and do something nice.

40:00.264 --> 40:02.266
I'm going.
Are you off?

40:02.333 --> 40:06.103
You're not staying to tidy up like?
No, I'll skip that part.

40:06.170 --> 40:09.173
Taking the fish,
I don't know what it'll achieve.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.109
But this is what our relationship
came down to.

40:12.176 --> 40:14.411
I've got three fucking goldfish

40:14.478 --> 40:18.282
called Scramble, Egg and Toast and
I'm about to take them to her house.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.684
What the hell has happened?

40:23.888 --> 40:28.726
We know Gaz has made some mistakes,
hopefully they can work things out.

40:28.793 --> 40:34.098
It's time to go. I'm taking Dan with
us but I think I forgot something.

40:34.165 --> 40:39.637
(cheering) James has got me
a leaving gift, ham.

40:39.703 --> 40:41.205
I didn't see that coming.

40:41.272 --> 40:44.141
I'm gonna miss you,
you little ham connoisseur.

40:44.208 --> 40:45.643
Bye.
See you later.

40:45.709 --> 40:50.014
It has been awkward between me and
Holly but that's how it had to be.

40:50.080 --> 40:53.884
Now we know where each other stand.
See you later. Bye.

40:53.951 --> 40:56.620
We used to be best friends,
it is sad.

40:56.687 --> 41:01.492
I'll fucking see you soon. See you
and all. Speak to you soon, son.

41:01.559 --> 41:06.597
The chance of seeing James is slim
now that he's wifed in with Kate.

41:08.265 --> 41:09.900
Girls, I'm off.

41:09.967 --> 41:12.169
I can't remember half of it

41:12.236 --> 41:15.172
but I've had an absolutely
fucking mint time.

41:20.744 --> 41:24.815
If I had to change one thing,
it'd be the times I got with Holly.

41:24.882 --> 41:27.117
We're friends,
I don't want anything more.

41:27.184 --> 41:29.019
See you later.
Bye, Scott.

41:29.086 --> 41:32.790
Love you to bits.
We wuve you

41:38.162 --> 41:42.600
I am actually gonna miss waking up
with me three little best friends

41:42.666 --> 41:47.404
and having a gossip and a natter.
You can't get friends like that.

41:51.375 --> 41:54.812
I've changed so much. I've gone
from being engaged to single.

41:54.879 --> 41:57.548
I've got big decisions
to make about Ricci.

41:57.615 --> 42:00.517
I'm look forward to having
my own space to do that.

42:00.584 --> 42:02.653
Right, bye.
Bye.

42:05.689 --> 42:10.294
We should let her take Charlotte
home, you're her replacement.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.829
Thanks.

42:11.896 --> 42:13.330
Charlotte's me best friend

42:13.397 --> 42:17.735
and I know it's gonna be harder, not
knowing if she'll ever come back.

42:17.801 --> 42:19.536
Bye, house.

42:19.603 --> 42:21.605
Miss you.
We'll miss you.

42:21.672 --> 42:25.242
Next time we'll be back
with everyone. Hopefully.

42:25.309 --> 42:29.914
Even though they all do me head in,
we are a proper family. It's amazing.

42:33.717 --> 42:35.052
Whoo!

42:41.625 --> 42:44.862
I don't know if Charlotte
will answer the door and punch us

42:44.929 --> 42:47.898
or take the fish
or not answer the door.

42:47.965 --> 42:50.801
At least I'm trying
to make amends. (doorbell rings)

42:53.470 --> 42:57.374
If Charlotte didn't come back,
my life would be ten times easier

42:57.441 --> 43:01.278
but I'd miss everything about
Charlotte being there. It'd be shit.

43:01.345 --> 43:04.148
She needs to come back.

43:07.351 --> 43:11.288
The one thing that stood out
for me this time in the house

43:11.355 --> 43:15.626
is Charlotte saying I love you.
That is next level shit

43:15.693 --> 43:20.965
and I haven't got a fucking clue
what it means or what's gonna happen.

43:21.031 --> 43:24.535
The mad thing is with me
and Charlotte I always know

43:24.601 --> 43:29.173
no matter how much time she needs
or I need or whatever happens

43:29.239 --> 43:31.775
somehow or other we'll always
come back. Somehow.
