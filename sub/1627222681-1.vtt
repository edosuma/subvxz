WEBVTT

00:29.039 --> 00:30.779
You're doing fine, Regina...

00:30.800 --> 00:34.079
Now, I want you to follow my hand.
Okay,

00:34.079 --> 00:36.079
Shawn...

00:36.079 --> 00:40.800
Tracking, tracking

00:40.879 --> 00:45.160
tracking, tracking...

00:45.200 --> 00:48.160
Excellent, Regina...

00:51.039 --> 00:54.180
Okay, Regina... now I'm gonna put
this sheet

00:54.239 --> 00:55.640
over you

00:55.680 --> 00:59.840
until Kalyani gets here...
Okay, Shawn.

01:12.640 --> 01:17.460
Who is it?
Kalyani, who are you expecting?

01:17.520 --> 01:22.560
Uh, no one else, um... are you alone?
Of course...

01:26.880 --> 01:29.340
So, you have some new tech to show me?
Is

01:29.439 --> 01:32.239
that why you invited me over?

01:32.240 --> 01:35.400
No, this is not just some other piece of

01:35.439 --> 01:35.940
tech...

01:36.000 --> 01:42.240
this is my masterpiece!

01:42.320 --> 01:45.559
I'd like you to meet robo endo genetic

01:45.600 --> 01:49.679
interface nano automation...

01:49.759 --> 01:52.060
I call her Regina for short.
Thank you for

01:52.079 --> 01:52.959
that...

01:52.960 --> 01:56.099
I mean if I had to call her robo endo

01:56.159 --> 01:58.340
whatever every time I talk to her that'd

01:58.399 --> 02:01.040
be stressful!

02:01.200 --> 02:06.640
Regina, stand up.
Command accepted...

02:09.440 --> 02:14.480
Don't worry she's not gonna hurt you.
Um...

02:14.560 --> 02:17.999
so her face,

02:18.000 --> 02:23.560
it's so unique... but

02:23.599 --> 02:25.720
who did you model that body after?
Who

02:25.760 --> 02:27.100
else do you think I'd model her body after?

02:27.120 --> 02:28.720
You think I’d model her after my

02:28.800 --> 02:31.919
gold digging ex Ria... no, I modeled it
after

02:31.920 --> 02:32.239
my

02:32.319 --> 02:36.160
best friend... you.
That's sweet... it doesn't

02:36.239 --> 02:37.720
take away from how creepy that

02:37.760 --> 02:41.120
is, that's sweet.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.460
Regina, I would like you to meet my best

02:44.480 --> 02:45.680
friend,

02:45.760 --> 02:49.239
Kalyani.
Nice to meet you...

02:49.280 --> 02:52.239
Kalyani...

02:53.680 --> 02:55.140
Is it safe to shake her hand, like she's

02:55.200 --> 02:57.019
not gonna break it or anything, right?

02:57.040 --> 02:58.900
She won't hurt you.

03:04.319 --> 03:07.999
Nice to meet you, Regina.
Told you.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.540
If I'm being honest, that was more like a

03:09.599 --> 03:11.000
guy's handshake!

03:11.040 --> 03:14.739
What did you expect, I mean she's a robot,

03:14.800 --> 03:18.180
she's not just some normal girl.

03:18.239 --> 03:21.279
Now remember, no one else in this family

03:21.280 --> 03:22.840
knows about her...

03:22.879 --> 03:26.980
so, loose lips sink ships.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.080
Aye, aye, captain.

03:30.159 --> 03:33.980
So, what did you build her for?

03:34.000 --> 03:38.040
She has a range of abilities, Regina

03:38.080 --> 03:41.800
go over your programming.
Okay, Shawn...

03:41.840 --> 03:45.120
I have the ability to be a teacher...

03:45.200 --> 03:47.860
I could be a maid for someone who is

03:47.920 --> 03:48.559
barely

03:48.560 --> 03:52.099
at home... I could be a police officer...

03:52.159 --> 03:55.580
I could be a...
Sex bot!

03:55.599 --> 03:58.439
No, Kalyani... that is not
what she's designed

03:58.480 --> 03:59.359
for!

03:59.439 --> 04:02.919
What is sex bot?

04:02.959 --> 04:06.240
Okay, apparently not.

04:06.319 --> 04:08.959
Regina, sit back down, I'm gonna finish

04:09.040 --> 04:10.099
your programming.

04:10.159 --> 04:12.200
Okay, Shawn...

04:15.599 --> 04:18.379
I wish you would not do that, I do not

04:18.400 --> 04:19.980
want her corrupted!

04:20.079 --> 04:23.200
Shawn, you're so innocent and sweet...

04:23.280 --> 04:26.400
don't you ever change,

04:26.880 --> 04:29.840
bye.

04:40.840 --> 04:44.640
Uh oh, Regina

04:44.720 --> 04:49.840
don't say anything.
Understood, Shawn...

04:53.360 --> 04:55.439
Shawn, you do realize it's two o'clock in

04:55.440 --> 04:56.559
the morning, right?

04:56.639 --> 04:59.660
Yeah, um I'm sorry mom I got tied up

04:59.759 --> 05:02.160
working in here.
Who's in there with you?

05:02.160 --> 05:03.300
Oh, nobody.

05:03.360 --> 05:06.400
I could swear I heard voices.
I was just

05:06.400 --> 05:07.979
talking to myself.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.440
Well, alright... it’s late, you should get

05:10.479 --> 05:11.800
some sleep.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.400
Okay, I'm sorry I woke you, mom...
good night.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.800
Good night.

05:19.840 --> 05:22.940
Shawn, I don't understand?

05:23.039 --> 05:26.219
You don't understand what, Regina?
I am no

05:26.240 --> 05:27.860
body...

05:27.919 --> 05:31.279
No, Regina... you’re not nobody.
I don't

05:31.360 --> 05:32.399
understand...

05:32.479 --> 05:35.160
you just told your mother that I am no

05:35.199 --> 05:37.360
body...

05:37.360 --> 05:40.939
I told her that, so she wouldn't know you

05:40.960 --> 05:42.960
were in here.

05:43.039 --> 05:46.540
I don't understand...

05:46.560 --> 05:50.800
I lied to her.
I don't understand,

05:50.840 --> 05:56.800
lie...
I wasn't truthful with her...

05:57.120 --> 05:59.440
You're not nobody... come on over here and

05:59.440 --> 06:00.160
sit down.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.560
Okay, Shawn.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.840
And now, Regina... I need to program you

06:08.880 --> 06:09.800
with a new mode,

06:09.840 --> 06:11.980
it's called quiet mode and it will be

06:12.000 --> 06:14.040
activated

06:14.080 --> 06:17.759
automatically every night at midnight.

06:17.840 --> 06:21.680
What is quiet mode?
Quiet mode

06:21.759 --> 06:25.620
you will talk

06:25.680 --> 06:29.040
like I'm talking right now.
Okay,

06:29.120 --> 06:33.440
Shawn... ready for programming,

06:33.680 --> 06:36.640
please talk again...

06:36.720 --> 06:40.240
In quiet mode, you will talk like this.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.440
Analysis complete... activating

06:43.440 --> 06:45.330
quiet mode, now...

06:49.840 --> 06:52.340
Is this correct?

06:54.240 --> 06:57.380
That's perfect, Regina... now I need you to

06:57.440 --> 06:58.039
come with me

06:58.080 --> 07:00.940
so I can program another thing for you.

07:01.039 --> 07:03.840
Okay, Shawn...

07:05.919 --> 07:09.400
Okay this is where I'll have to keep you,

07:09.440 --> 07:12.000
so that nobody will find out that you're

07:12.000 --> 07:12.739
around.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.620
Okay, activate sleep mode

07:16.639 --> 07:22.720
now.
Understood, activating sleep mode now...

08:17.120 --> 08:20.100
Cute, reall cute... you enjoying yourself?

08:20.160 --> 08:23.960
Oh, mellow out... so, Aisha told me to come

08:24.000 --> 08:24.920
and wake you up

08:24.960 --> 08:27.440
and her exact words were: tell that dork

08:27.520 --> 08:30.180
to get up because breakfast is ready.

08:30.240 --> 08:34.040
All right, tell her, I'll uh, be down

08:34.080 --> 08:37.399
shortly.
Aye, aye, captain.

08:37.440 --> 08:39.540
I'm about to head to the office.
Okay.

08:39.599 --> 08:41.840
Bye!
Bye.

08:51.279 --> 08:52.520
Did you tell him I said breakfast was

08:52.560 --> 08:54.640
ready?
I sure did...

08:54.720 --> 08:56.579
he should be down soon.
Thank you,

08:56.640 --> 08:59.279
Kalyani.

09:00.640 --> 09:04.739
Okay, well...I'm off to work now, bye.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.539
Bye. Bye, Kalyani.
Bye, Kalyani.

09:21.760 --> 09:26.739
Regina, power up.
Power up!

09:26.800 --> 09:29.800
Man, I am such a nerd...

09:29.839 --> 09:33.180
programming you to come online

09:33.200 --> 09:35.599
in the Altered Beast voice...
Regina, I want

09:35.680 --> 09:36.360
you to

09:36.399 --> 09:39.279
activate cleaning mode, while I go down

09:39.360 --> 09:41.180
and have breakfast with uh

09:41.279 --> 09:44.839
Maggie, Aisha, and mom.
Command accepted...

09:44.880 --> 09:48.439
activating cleaning mode now...

10:03.600 --> 10:06.640
Morning everyone.
It would be, if a

10:06.720 --> 10:08.240
certain person didn't keep
me up till two in

10:08.240 --> 10:09.440
the morning

10:09.440 --> 10:12.580
I know, I'm sorry, mom.
Don't worry about

10:12.640 --> 10:13.600
that, Shawn... I'll go get your plate

10:13.680 --> 10:14.779
breakfast.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.279
Thanks, sis.
So, what was so important that it

10:17.279 --> 10:20.060
kept you up until two in the morning

10:20.079 --> 10:22.120
Uh, just some new tech I've been working

10:22.160 --> 10:23.060
on.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.559
Figures, I don't know why my brother

10:24.560 --> 10:26.920
had to grow up to be such a nerd.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.260
Yeah, it would be different if you'd make

10:28.320 --> 10:30.119
an actual career out of it,

10:30.160 --> 10:31.420
you should sign a military deal with

10:31.519 --> 10:33.880
your friend Matthew Hudson.

10:33.920 --> 10:37.679
Mom, you know how I feel about this.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.220
Well, he's coming by for a visit later

10:39.279 --> 10:43.120
today, I wish you'd reconsider.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.720
Come on, mom... if he doesn't want to we

10:44.720 --> 10:46.700
should be more understanding.

10:46.720 --> 10:50.740
Thanks, sis.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.399
Are you okay?
Yeah... um,

11:03.440 --> 11:06.399
I've got to go do something...

11:07.440 --> 11:09.920
I can't believe he's such a loser.
Leave

11:09.920 --> 11:12.639
him alone!

11:12.720 --> 11:15.839
Children behave!

11:17.520 --> 11:19.920
Regina, what are you doing out here?
I was

11:20.800 --> 11:22.700
looking for you, Shawn...

11:22.720 --> 11:25.920
Why are you in quiet mode, it is not past

11:26.000 --> 11:29.040
midnight?
I'm in quiet mode, because I don't want

11:29.120 --> 11:30.230
anyone to know you're here...

11:30.240 --> 11:32.350
Come on!

11:54.079 --> 11:57.820
You've got mail!
What?!

11:57.839 --> 12:00.560
Ignore that!
Ignoring that...

12:00.620 --> 12:05.260
Okay, um... I want you to
analyze this video

12:06.079 --> 12:09.379
and I want you to watch how this person

12:09.440 --> 12:12.019
is talking and analyze it, so that you can

12:12.079 --> 12:13.480
speak more human.

12:13.519 --> 12:15.260
Okay, Shawn...

12:17.760 --> 12:19.620
Welcome to the kill count, where we tally

12:19.680 --> 12:21.059
up the victims in all our favorite

12:21.120 --> 12:22.920
horror movies, I'm James A. Janisse
Processing...

12:22.959 --> 12:24.300
and today we're looking at
Processing...

12:24.320 --> 12:28.000
Indestructible released in 2009.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.200
Analysis complete...

12:34.639 --> 12:37.760
Is this correct, Shawn?

12:37.760 --> 12:41.300
That's better, sounds a little more human.

12:41.360 --> 12:45.139
All right, want you to go

12:45.200 --> 12:47.740
around the back and while you're doing

12:47.839 --> 12:48.980
it...

12:49.040 --> 12:50.460
coming around the front
to knock on the front

12:50.480 --> 12:52.100
door, I want you to observe

12:52.160 --> 12:56.800
any human behavior you see.
Understood, Shawn...

13:24.240 --> 13:29.000
Tracking, tracking,

13:29.040 --> 13:32.539
tracking, tracking,

13:33.263 --> 13:35.576
Girl, I just walked away!

13:35.600 --> 13:41.439
Analysis complete...

14:10.240 --> 14:15.019
Tracking, tracking,

14:15.040 --> 14:19.500
tracking, tracking,

14:19.519 --> 14:21.060
Analysis complete...

14:31.600 --> 14:34.160
I'll get it...

14:40.320 --> 14:44.879
Regina, come on in.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.220
Why are you walking like that?
I observed

14:47.279 --> 14:48.239
human

14:48.320 --> 14:51.740
behavior...
Okay, you can

14:51.839 --> 14:56.239
stop... okay, walk normal,

14:56.240 --> 14:59.839
come on.
Okay, Shawn...

15:04.320 --> 15:07.660
Mom, Aisha, Maggie...

15:07.680 --> 15:12.140
this is my friend, Regina.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.960
Nice to meet you, Regina.
It is nice to

15:15.040 --> 15:16.360
meet you too...

15:16.384 --> 15:18.136
I'm Maggie.

15:18.160 --> 15:22.020
I'm Aisha.
It's nice to meet you,

15:22.039 --> 15:24.339
Aisha...

15:28.079 --> 15:31.179
Hi, I'm Shawn's mom, Sharon... so how long

15:31.199 --> 15:33.200
have you known my son?

15:33.279 --> 15:37.939
Since, yesterday...
Where did you two meet?

15:38.000 --> 15:41.820
His bedroom...
I thought you said nobody

15:41.839 --> 15:43.839
was in your room last night?!

15:43.920 --> 15:46.739
That's right, I am nobody...

15:48.880 --> 15:50.939
Shawn, kitchen now!

16:01.839 --> 16:04.319
Okay Shawn, what is that girl on?
She's not

16:04.399 --> 16:05.440
on anything!

16:05.519 --> 16:07.400
Oh bull, don't give me that, no girl talks

16:07.440 --> 16:08.739
like that unless she's on drugs or from

16:08.800 --> 16:10.560
outer space!

16:10.639 --> 16:13.299
Mom, she's not on drugs... she doesn't even

16:13.360 --> 16:14.340
know what drugs are.

16:14.399 --> 16:17.039
Then why does she talk like that?
She

16:17.040 --> 16:18.639
can't help the way she talks, she's from

16:18.639 --> 16:19.800
India.

16:19.839 --> 16:21.600
Well, I don't like her, I don't know why

16:21.600 --> 16:23.579
you want to be with a girl like that,

16:23.600 --> 16:27.220
you had a good thing going with Ria.
Mom,

16:27.279 --> 16:29.879
Ria was no prize, she was only after me

16:29.920 --> 16:31.240
for my money,

16:31.279 --> 16:32.959
she never really loved me.
And you think

16:33.040 --> 16:35.700
this Indian girl loves you?

16:35.759 --> 16:39.599
Regina is not my girlfriend!

16:39.600 --> 16:41.139
And that's why she was in your bedroom

16:41.199 --> 16:42.600
well into two in the morning and why

16:42.639 --> 16:43.940
you've been keeping her a secret from the

16:44.000 --> 16:45.440
rest of us?

16:45.440 --> 16:46.979
Because I knew this was how you would

16:47.040 --> 16:50.060
react, besides who's to say I can't have

16:50.079 --> 16:51.319
a female friend

16:51.360 --> 16:53.440
in my room with me and not be in a

16:53.519 --> 16:54.960
relationship with her?
Because I know

16:55.040 --> 16:57.320
different!

16:57.360 --> 16:59.880
Kalyani's in my room all the time, you

16:59.920 --> 17:01.679
never question that!

17:01.680 --> 17:03.259
You and Kalyani have been friends since

17:03.279 --> 17:04.939
you were children.

17:04.959 --> 17:07.000
And who says I can't make a new female

17:07.039 --> 17:07.960
friend?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.319
I do, I forbid it!
Tough...

17:11.360 --> 17:14.299
now tonight I am going to have a dinner

17:14.319 --> 17:14.720
party

17:14.799 --> 17:16.659
to introduce Regina to the rest of my

17:16.720 --> 17:20.959
friends and I don't want you messing it

17:30.840 --> 17:33.840
up!

17:34.320 --> 17:37.840
Regina, uh... can you go upstairs and

17:37.840 --> 17:42.340
wait for me in my bedroom.
Okay, Shawn...

17:53.760 --> 17:56.080
So, what do you guys think?
Well, she's a

17:56.160 --> 17:56.860
weirdo...

17:56.880 --> 17:58.900
but considering that you
are a nerd, you are

17:58.960 --> 18:00.340
perfect for each other.

18:00.400 --> 18:04.560
Shut up, Aisha...
I think she's nice, Shawn.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.360
Thanks, Maggs.

18:08.160 --> 18:12.600
Well, I'm going to go upstairs...

18:12.640 --> 18:15.939
let me know when, uh Matthew gets here.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.440
Okay, will do.
Thanks, Maggs.

18:29.039 --> 18:32.220
Shawn, Matthew's here.
Okay...

18:32.240 --> 18:33.920
tell him I'll be right down...

18:38.395 --> 18:42.295
Ragina, while I'm

18:42.320 --> 18:44.260
down there,

18:44.320 --> 18:46.160
in case somebody comes in, I want you to

18:46.160 --> 18:49.340
be watching videos on this.

18:49.360 --> 18:52.040
Okay, Shawn... command accepted...

18:58.960 --> 19:01.959
Hey, Matthew. Hey there.
How you been doing,

19:02.000 --> 19:02.460
my friend?

19:02.559 --> 19:05.760
Great, great. Good.
So, tell me what's the

19:05.760 --> 19:07.679
latest in the tech?
Any big ones lately?

19:07.760 --> 19:11.640
I have, I just came up with something huge.

19:11.679 --> 19:12.560
So, is this going to be the one that

19:12.640 --> 19:14.120
finally pulls you into a military

19:14.160 --> 19:16.720
contract?

19:16.880 --> 19:18.919
Matthew, is there a time when we are

19:18.960 --> 19:19.860
going to get together...

19:19.919 --> 19:22.140
where you are not going to try to pull

19:22.160 --> 19:23.400
me into signing

19:23.440 --> 19:27.180
some military crap?
Shawn, look

19:27.200 --> 19:29.280
you're a genius with the tech, everything

19:29.280 --> 19:30.480
I've ever seen

19:30.480 --> 19:34.060
from you has been perfect for military

19:34.080 --> 19:35.760
and that's what I do for a living... so,

19:35.760 --> 19:38.140
what did... what do you expect?

19:38.160 --> 19:41.800
I expect my friend to keep business

19:41.840 --> 19:43.580
out of our friendship.
What are you so

19:43.600 --> 19:45.239
scared of, I mean

19:45.280 --> 19:46.979
one of these projects would be millions

19:47.039 --> 19:49.620
of dollars in your pocket.

19:49.679 --> 19:52.240
I have told you, I don't want to sign

19:52.320 --> 19:53.379
with military,

19:53.440 --> 19:55.639
because they will use it to kill people,

19:55.679 --> 19:56.980
it's not about the money.

19:57.039 --> 19:58.840
You do know that the military uses tech

19:58.880 --> 20:00.560
for other things besides killing people,

20:00.640 --> 20:00.920
right?

20:00.960 --> 20:03.059
It's not the military I'm worried about,

20:03.120 --> 20:04.519
it's the politicians

20:04.559 --> 20:07.840
that will use the military

20:07.919 --> 20:09.840
to kill people!
You know you're

20:09.840 --> 20:11.820
unbelievable man.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.320
You know what...

20:15.679 --> 20:18.540
I'm done having this conversation, you

20:18.559 --> 20:20.040
can go.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.000
All right...

20:31.760 --> 20:35.840
You know, you're making a big mistake!

20:55.280 --> 20:57.120
So Amelie, what seems to be the problem

20:57.200 --> 20:59.440
today?

20:59.520 --> 21:02.579
I can't seem to get any sleep, I keep on

21:02.640 --> 21:03.580
having the same

21:03.679 --> 21:06.880
dream.
Okay, well...

21:06.880 --> 21:10.419
describe this dream to me.
Okay... well, um

21:10.480 --> 21:13.900
it all starts when I'm all alone out in

21:13.919 --> 21:15.199
these woods

21:15.200 --> 21:18.779
and this scary man wearing a black

21:18.799 --> 21:19.660
hooded shirt

21:19.679 --> 21:23.719
is stalking me.
Describe this man to me,

21:23.760 --> 21:27.859
Amelie.
Okay... well, he's got these, um

21:27.919 --> 21:30.500
he's got these four leather straps

21:30.559 --> 21:31.960
around his wrists,

21:32.000 --> 21:35.280
and uh, he's got long dark hair,

21:35.360 --> 21:39.200
and oh um, a goatee and a mustache,

21:39.280 --> 21:43.500
and oh he's got these...

21:43.500 --> 21:49.139
Fiery red eyes!
Amelie, that's a very vivid dream

21:49.200 --> 21:50.940
But that's not even the worst part of it

21:51.039 --> 21:53.820
all, uh he's got these two girls helping

21:53.840 --> 21:55.499
him.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.740
Can you describe the girls to me?
Okay,

21:58.799 --> 22:02.220
one seems to be in her early 20's, and

22:02.240 --> 22:05.480
she's got medium length brown hair, uh

22:05.520 --> 22:08.420
she's dressed in a black leather jacket,

22:08.480 --> 22:10.240
and black jeans.

22:10.320 --> 22:13.840
And the other, um she's probably about 12

22:13.840 --> 22:14.640
years old,

22:14.640 --> 22:17.779
and she's got long blonde hair, uh

22:17.840 --> 22:21.580
and she's got a black leather outfit on,

22:21.679 --> 22:24.859
oh and she's got these spiky gauntlets

22:24.880 --> 22:26.079
on her wrists,

22:26.159 --> 22:29.639
and spiky choker...

22:29.679 --> 22:32.980
Oh and they both they both have these

22:33.039 --> 22:38.080
fiery red eyes, like their father!

22:38.720 --> 22:41.740
Okay, Amelie... um,

22:41.760 --> 22:45.400
I can definitely help you, uh with this

22:45.440 --> 22:47.599
dream issue that you're having, um I see

22:47.600 --> 22:48.740
it all the time.

22:48.799 --> 22:55.840
Oh, okay... thank you, doctor.

23:06.840 --> 23:10.360
Amelie, can you hear me?

23:10.400 --> 23:13.719
Yes, doctor... I can hear you...

23:13.760 --> 23:15.859
And you're ready to listen to me and

23:15.919 --> 23:18.140
only me?

23:18.159 --> 23:22.600
Correct, you and only you...

23:22.640 --> 23:25.959
Amelie, these dreams you're having

23:26.000 --> 23:28.460
are the result of watching way too many

23:28.559 --> 23:30.940
scary movies.

23:30.960 --> 23:33.380
I know this because the dream you're

23:33.440 --> 23:34.440
describing,

23:34.480 --> 23:36.640
accurately describes a film that I've

23:36.640 --> 23:38.579
just watched

23:38.640 --> 23:43.259
called Indestructible: No Place to Hide.

23:43.279 --> 23:46.120
Now from this moment forward, you will no

23:46.159 --> 23:49.480
longer watch scary movies.

23:49.520 --> 23:54.080
I will no longer watch scary movies...

23:54.559 --> 23:56.820
From this point forward, you will only

23:56.880 --> 23:58.300
watch children's

23:58.320 --> 24:01.540
or family oriented films.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.579
I will only watch children's or

24:04.640 --> 24:07.679
family oriented films...

24:07.679 --> 24:11.660
Good, now listen to me very carefully,

24:11.679 --> 24:13.760
since I have helped you out so much

24:13.760 --> 24:15.360
today,

24:15.360 --> 24:19.360
you are so grateful to me that you

24:19.360 --> 24:23.360
want to pay me double.

24:23.760 --> 24:27.200
I want to pay you double...

24:27.279 --> 24:30.159
Amelie, when I snap my fingers you will

24:30.159 --> 24:32.500
awaken from this trance and remember

24:32.559 --> 24:35.979
nothing while you were under, except for

24:36.000 --> 24:39.279
that you want to pay me double.

24:39.919 --> 24:42.140
Yes, doctor...

24:51.840 --> 24:55.459
Amelie, how do you feel?
I feel wonderful...

25:00.400 --> 25:02.460
I'm so appreciative of what you've done

25:02.559 --> 25:04.960
for me,

25:05.919 --> 25:09.340
ah... I'm gonna pay you

25:09.360 --> 25:14.219
double!
Really, um

25:14.240 --> 25:15.880
well, why don't you go ahead and go into

25:15.919 --> 25:18.059
that next room and see Miss Suzi,

25:18.080 --> 25:20.080
she'll take care of all of that.

25:20.159 --> 25:22.480
All right,

25:22.480 --> 25:26.040
thank you, doctor.
You have a great day.

25:26.080 --> 25:29.840
You too.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.720
How's your day going so far, Dr. Wheeler?

25:42.720 --> 25:45.460
Not too shabby, Matthew... what brings you

25:45.520 --> 25:47.760
by?

25:48.080 --> 25:52.000
I'm just a little frustrated right now.

25:53.279 --> 25:56.100
What's going on?
I'm just frustrated

25:56.159 --> 25:57.960
because I'm trying to get my friend, Shawn

25:58.000 --> 25:59.740
to sign this contract

25:59.760 --> 26:02.180
to, uh work with me a bit, he's a genius

26:02.240 --> 26:04.020
with the tech, and he'd make millions on

26:04.080 --> 26:06.240
a military contract, I just can't get him

26:06.320 --> 26:10.179
to sign.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.180
You know I can get

26:13.279 --> 26:16.440
this Shawn guy to sign this contract no

26:16.480 --> 26:18.640
problem.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.840
And how would you do that?

26:22.480 --> 26:26.300
I am the best psychiatrist for a reason,

26:26.320 --> 26:29.940
I can get anybody to do anything.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.799
Not sure I believe you, okay.

26:33.840 --> 26:38.700
You doubt me, Matthew...

26:38.799 --> 26:41.140
I don't normally do this, but I'll prove

26:41.200 --> 26:42.560
it to you.

26:42.640 --> 26:46.940
How?
Are there any girls or a

26:46.960 --> 26:50.180
woman you have your eye on?
Yeah,

26:50.240 --> 26:52.000
there's this cute waitress named Samaira

26:52.080 --> 26:53.600
that works at this restaurant, I've had

26:53.600 --> 26:57.200
my eye on for quite a while.

26:57.440 --> 27:02.040
Great let's go grab a bite to eat.

27:02.080 --> 27:07.840
Show me.

27:15.200 --> 27:19.100
Shawn, I learned something new,

27:19.120 --> 27:23.200
would you like to see?
Sure, Regina.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.000
Okay, Shawn...

27:31.600 --> 27:34.080
This robot has a style that you can't

27:34.080 --> 27:34.840
deny...

27:34.880 --> 27:38.240
This robot has a style no one can deny...

27:38.240 --> 27:40.560
This robot has the style to dance the

27:40.640 --> 27:41.640
night away...

27:49.360 --> 27:52.579
What do you think, homie?

27:52.640 --> 27:55.239
That was cute and all, but please don't

27:55.279 --> 27:56.940
do that again...

27:57.039 --> 28:00.840
and don't call me homie.
Whatever you say,

28:00.840 --> 28:05.360
dog...
Don't call me dog either,

28:05.440 --> 28:08.940
my name is Shawn... you know that.

28:08.960 --> 28:12.540
Okay, Shawn... but you're no fun...

28:18.799 --> 28:21.180
If you really want to look up some stuff

28:21.200 --> 28:22.880
on this...

28:22.880 --> 28:26.060
Here, look up videos

28:26.080 --> 28:29.739
on human behavior of how

28:29.760 --> 28:32.980
people interact when they

28:33.039 --> 28:36.039
are in a loving relationship, okay...

28:36.080 --> 28:38.980
since I'm probably gonna have to be passing

28:39.039 --> 28:40.079
you off

28:40.080 --> 28:43.620
as my girlfriend now.
Okay, Shawn...

28:43.679 --> 28:47.799
Command accepted...

28:59.520 --> 29:02.300
Hey, back again I see... can I get you your

29:02.399 --> 29:03.199
regular?

29:03.200 --> 29:04.760
Uh no, thank you... we're gonna look this

29:04.799 --> 29:06.880
menu over a little bit, okay.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.479
Okay, well let me know when you're ready

29:08.480 --> 29:11.320
to order.

29:13.279 --> 29:18.720
Is that her?
Yeah, lovely isn't she?

29:19.279 --> 29:22.900
If you say so... now

29:22.960 --> 29:25.159
I want you to get her attention, bring her

29:25.200 --> 29:26.060
back over here,

29:26.159 --> 29:28.879
and have her take your order.
Okay, I can

29:28.960 --> 29:31.200
do that...

29:31.279 --> 29:35.519
ma'am.
You ready?

29:35.600 --> 29:37.820
Thank you, um I think I will actually

29:37.919 --> 29:39.500
have my usual today,

29:39.520 --> 29:41.959
but instead of, uh ketchup can I get

29:42.000 --> 29:43.159
mustard?

29:43.783 --> 29:45.783
And you?

29:52.840 --> 29:56.140
Samaira, can you hear me?
Yes,

29:56.159 --> 29:59.439
I can hear you...
Good,

29:59.440 --> 30:01.020
Now you're ready to listen to me and only

30:01.039 --> 30:03.520
me, yes?
Yes,

30:03.520 --> 30:09.500
I'll listen to you and only you...

30:09.520 --> 30:13.199
Samaira, are you married?
No

30:13.200 --> 30:16.340
I'm not married...
Do you have a boyfriend?

30:16.399 --> 30:19.419
Yes, I have a boyfriend...

30:19.440 --> 30:21.879
Okay, listen to me very carefully, you're

30:21.919 --> 30:23.640
going to call your boyfriend,

30:23.679 --> 30:25.839
you're going to break up with him, you're

30:25.840 --> 30:26.979
going to tell him

30:27.039 --> 30:29.180
you never want to see him again, and you

30:29.279 --> 30:30.840
never want him to contact you

30:30.880 --> 30:33.779
ever again, do you understand?
Yes, I

30:33.840 --> 30:35.580
understand...

30:35.679 --> 30:38.819
Good, now call him now.
Yes,

30:38.880 --> 30:41.840
I will obey...
And when you make this call,

30:41.919 --> 30:44.220
you will sound completely normal, not

30:44.240 --> 30:46.640
like you were in this deep trance.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.740
Yes, I understand...

30:59.039 --> 31:02.580
Hey, it's me... I'm calling to let you know

31:02.640 --> 31:04.860
that it's over,

31:04.880 --> 31:07.300
I never want to see you again, don't

31:07.360 --> 31:09.120
contact me again,

31:09.200 --> 31:13.120
I'm done with you, bye.

31:14.640 --> 31:18.080
Well done, now look at Matthew.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.880
As you command...

31:21.679 --> 31:24.319
Matthew is now your boyfriend, you love

31:24.399 --> 31:25.840
your boyfriend,

31:25.919 --> 31:27.360
and you will do whatever he wants you to

31:27.440 --> 31:29.340
do, do you understand?

31:29.360 --> 31:33.840
Yes, whatever he wants...

31:34.240 --> 31:38.340
Matthew, write down your address

31:38.399 --> 31:42.040
and give it to her.

31:51.600 --> 31:54.000
This is your address, this is where you

31:54.080 --> 31:55.140
live,

31:55.200 --> 31:58.839
do you understand?
Yes, I understand...

31:58.840 --> 32:03.039
Good, now I need you to look at me,

32:04.399 --> 32:06.000
When I snap my fingers you will remember

32:06.480 --> 32:07.959
nothing of what just happened

32:08.000 --> 32:10.120
you will just continue to take our order,

32:10.159 --> 32:11.040
do you understand?

32:11.120 --> 32:14.840
Yes, continue with your order...

32:16.320 --> 32:19.080
What can I get you?
I'll have exactly

32:19.120 --> 32:22.020
what he's having, thank you.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.300
I can't wait for the night, baby... I'm

32:24.320 --> 32:25.140
going to fix us

32:25.200 --> 32:28.940
a nice romantic dinner.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.459
I cannot believe that that actually

32:34.480 --> 32:36.519
worked.

32:36.559 --> 32:39.440
Well, I can easily do the exact same

32:39.519 --> 32:40.159
thing

32:40.240 --> 32:42.460
to your buddy Shawn and get him to sign

32:42.559 --> 32:43.740
your contract...

32:43.760 --> 32:47.840
or any contract you want him to.

32:47.864 --> 32:49.336
But first...

32:54.480 --> 32:58.559
Excuse me, Miss.
Yes...

33:04.159 --> 33:08.000
Can you hear me?
I can hear you...

33:08.080 --> 33:10.140
When I snap my fingers you'll remember

33:10.159 --> 33:11.820
nothing of what you just heard, do you

33:11.840 --> 33:12.650
understand?

33:12.720 --> 33:14.029
I understand...

33:28.159 --> 33:30.960
Hey Shawn what's up?
Hey Kalyani, I was

33:30.960 --> 33:32.880
wondering if you could do me a favor?

33:32.960 --> 33:36.040
Uh, yeah sure... what's up?
Well, I'm having a

33:36.080 --> 33:38.240
dinner party tonight to introduce

33:38.240 --> 33:40.620
all the rest of my friends to Regina and

33:40.640 --> 33:43.120
uh, I was wondering if you could stop by

33:43.120 --> 33:46.719
Matthew Hudson's office and invite him?

33:46.720 --> 33:49.840
Yeah, but why can't you just call him and

33:49.919 --> 33:51.759
ask him?

33:51.840 --> 33:54.120
You know how he's always, uh... bugging me

33:54.159 --> 33:56.239
to sign a military contract?

33:56.320 --> 34:00.979
Yeah.
Well, I gave him a definite no

34:01.039 --> 34:03.220
earlier today and I think he's still mad

34:03.279 --> 34:04.940
about it.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.439
Okay, well... yeah, um
I'll just go ahead and

34:07.440 --> 34:10.619
swing by I'm almost there anyway.

34:10.639 --> 34:13.079
All right thanks, Kalyani... you're a

34:13.119 --> 34:14.800
lifesaver.

34:14.879 --> 34:17.979
I know and listen after you modeled your

34:18.000 --> 34:19.639
sexbot after me...

34:19.679 --> 34:21.600
you're gonna owe me for a lifetime.

34:23.200 --> 34:27.000
But you know Regina is no sexbot.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.160
Okay, whatever you have to tell yourself

34:29.200 --> 34:30.959
to sleep at night,

34:30.960 --> 34:33.319
anyway, um I'll just go ahead and get off

34:33.359 --> 34:35.859
here, because I'm almost here, okay.

34:35.919 --> 34:39.279
All right, thanks... bye.

34:39.359 --> 34:41.679
Bye.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.560
And you're sure you can get him to sign

34:48.639 --> 34:50.920
that contract?

34:50.960 --> 34:53.519
How many times do I have to tell you,

34:53.520 --> 34:55.820
with my psychiatric skills

34:55.919 --> 34:58.680
I can literally get anybody to do

34:58.720 --> 35:01.280
anything...

35:01.440 --> 35:04.740
but if I do this for you,

35:04.800 --> 35:08.620
what's in it for me?
Well, I mean

35:08.640 --> 35:11.480
his family's rich, so... if you wanted to

35:11.520 --> 35:13.240
you could hypnotize them and have them

35:13.280 --> 35:16.619
give you their money.

35:16.640 --> 35:19.039
That would be great, you just better be

35:19.119 --> 35:19.839
right

35:19.839 --> 35:21.819
about Shawn's family having the money,

35:21.839 --> 35:23.040
that I can

35:23.119 --> 35:27.000
persuade them to give to me.
Excuse me,

35:27.040 --> 35:28.339
what do you think you're doing snooping

35:28.400 --> 35:31.839
out here!

35:32.000 --> 35:35.119
What is going on out here?
I caught this

35:35.119 --> 35:37.080
girl snooping!
No...

35:37.119 --> 35:39.260
no, I, I was just here to ask Matthew a

35:39.280 --> 35:40.140
question?

35:40.160 --> 35:42.600
Um, I think you should accompany me and

35:42.640 --> 35:43.960
Dr. Doug into the office

35:44.000 --> 35:49.760
for a quick chat.
That'll be all, Suzi.

35:51.715 --> 35:53.715
Let go of me!

35:54.240 --> 35:56.559
Now be honest, how much of that did you

35:56.560 --> 35:57.300
hear?

35:57.359 --> 36:00.800
I didn't hear anything... honest.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.280
Relax.
You really think you're gonna, you think

36:04.320 --> 36:06.839
you're gonna hypnotize me?
Look close.

36:06.880 --> 36:09.500
It's not gonna work...

36:13.839 --> 36:16.400
Sit down.

36:21.040 --> 36:26.220
Can you hear me? Yes, doctor...
And you're

36:26.240 --> 36:27.520
ready to listen to me

36:27.520 --> 36:30.680
and only me?
Yes, listen to you

36:30.720 --> 36:35.220
and only you...
Who is this girl?

36:35.280 --> 36:40.260
This is Shawn's best friend, Kalyani.

36:40.320 --> 36:43.720
Kalyani, how much did you hear earlier?

36:43.760 --> 36:46.279
I heard everything about making Shawn

36:46.320 --> 36:47.980
sign the contract and stealing money

36:48.079 --> 36:50.880
from his family...

36:52.079 --> 36:53.840
What was the real reason you came to

36:53.920 --> 36:55.440
Matthew's office today?

36:55.440 --> 36:57.419
To invite him to a dinner party, where

36:57.440 --> 36:59.080
Shawn's introducing his new girlfriend,

36:59.119 --> 37:01.680
Regina...

37:02.320 --> 37:05.460
Good, Kalyani...

37:05.520 --> 37:08.920
you will forget overhearing everything

37:08.960 --> 37:10.280
you heard earlier

37:10.320 --> 37:14.459
and you only came by to invite me

37:14.480 --> 37:17.300
and Matthew to this dinner party tonight,

37:17.359 --> 37:18.360
do you understand?

37:18.400 --> 37:21.740
I understand...
Good, now when I snap my

37:21.760 --> 37:23.000
fingers,

37:23.040 --> 37:25.180
you will have forgotten everything,

37:25.200 --> 37:26.419
except for what I have told you to

37:26.480 --> 37:27.119
remember,

37:27.119 --> 37:31.119
do you understand?
Yes, doctor...

37:34.000 --> 37:36.620
It was so nice to meet you, I'll see you

37:36.640 --> 37:38.230
two at the dinner party.

37:42.960 --> 37:48.660
Mom, Aisha... I know how you two are,

37:48.720 --> 37:51.740
control yourself this party.

37:51.760 --> 37:55.440
I know how to behave in my own house.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.339
What... I'm what they
do anything to ruin your

38:00.400 --> 38:01.939
precious party.

38:13.680 --> 38:16.980
Hey, beautiful.
Hey, sexy.

38:17.040 --> 38:19.680
Hey, so I did invite Matthew like
you asked, but he's

38:19.680 --> 38:21.260
bringing his friend, Dr. Wheeler.

38:21.280 --> 38:24.960
Oh okay. Okay.
All right.

38:29.520 --> 38:33.160
Hi all... so,

38:33.200 --> 38:36.899
how are you doing, Regina?
Hello, Kalyani...

38:36.960 --> 38:39.599
I love you...

38:41.420 --> 38:42.500
Ragina...

38:42.560 --> 38:43.940
you're not supposed to show that kind of

38:44.000 --> 38:47.380
affection to anyone but your boyfriend.

38:47.440 --> 38:50.480
I'm sorry, Shawn...

38:51.119 --> 38:55.030
I love you...
Don't worry, Shawn...

38:55.119 --> 39:01.739
we can share her.

39:17.140 --> 39:22.510
Matthew. Shawn.
And who is this?

39:22.720 --> 39:25.520
This is my friend, Dr. Wheeler.
Dr.

39:25.599 --> 39:26.239
Doug Wheeler,

39:26.320 --> 39:29.839
at your service.
Nice to meet you, come on in.

39:36.880 --> 39:41.660
Mom, everyone... I'd like you meet

39:41.680 --> 39:44.940
Matthew's friend, Dr. Doug Wheeler.

39:44.960 --> 39:48.559
Nice to meet you...

39:48.640 --> 39:51.300
Hi, Dr. Wheeler, welcome to our home.
Please...

39:51.359 --> 39:52.380
call me, Doug.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.240
Okay, Doug... I'm Sharon, Shawn's mom and

39:55.280 --> 39:56.640
this is my daughter, Aisha.

39:58.664 --> 39:59.896
Nice to meet you.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.639
And this is my youngest, Maggie. Hi.
Nice

40:02.640 --> 40:04.639
to meet you.

40:16.560 --> 40:19.739
Who could that be, everyone I invited

40:19.760 --> 40:21.939
is already here.

40:31.160 --> 40:34.600
What the hell are you doing here?
Your mom invited me.

40:34.639 --> 40:37.019
She what??

40:41.119 --> 40:43.560
Mom, I know what you're trying to

40:43.599 --> 40:44.939
do here

40:44.960 --> 40:46.839
it's not gonna work!

40:46.863 --> 40:48.863
Oh Shawn, don't be so melodramatic...

40:48.887 --> 40:50.887
Now let's all sit down and eat.

41:13.599 --> 41:15.920
That was a great meal, thank you.
Well...

41:16.000 --> 41:17.519
thank you, Matt.

41:17.520 --> 41:21.060
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
So, listen...

41:21.119 --> 41:22.519
me and Dr. Wheeler have a business

41:22.560 --> 41:24.319
proposition that we were hoping to talk

41:24.319 --> 41:25.060
to you about,

41:25.119 --> 41:26.960
um, and I was wondering if it would be

41:26.960 --> 41:28.940
possible for, uh Dr. Wheeler to spend the

41:28.960 --> 41:30.240
night here

41:30.240 --> 41:32.959
in the spare room?
Oh sure, that's fine,

41:33.040 --> 41:35.359
you can stay anytime and as well as your

41:35.359 --> 41:37.339
friends.

41:37.359 --> 41:39.819
Excellent, well I'm going back to my

41:39.839 --> 41:41.060
apartment to spend the evening with

41:41.119 --> 41:42.540
Samaira...

41:42.560 --> 41:44.240
would one of you guys mind to show Dr.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.200
Doug to the spare room?
Sure, Matthew... I

41:46.240 --> 41:48.380
can do that.
Great

41:48.400 --> 41:53.500
thanks, see you guys later.

42:03.680 --> 42:06.000
Seriously Shawn, what are you see in this

42:06.000 --> 42:08.800
girl over me?

42:09.440 --> 42:11.439
Because she's not just out for my money,

42:11.520 --> 42:13.800
you never didn't care about me.

42:13.839 --> 42:16.780
I was not just after your money and

42:16.800 --> 42:18.840
she's just some loser that can't talk

42:18.880 --> 42:20.980
right.

42:21.040 --> 42:25.280
You are not all that, home girl...

42:25.280 --> 42:30.040
Regina, you don't need to help, I got this.

42:32.640 --> 42:36.560
Hey, what did I miss?
Oh, not much really...

42:36.560 --> 42:38.919
oh, unless you'd count Ria verbally

42:38.960 --> 42:41.039
assaulting Regina,

42:41.119 --> 42:42.839
that's really it.

42:46.560 --> 42:50.000
So, why do you care, why are you even here?

42:50.000 --> 42:52.320
Come on, Shawn... we had some fun times, we

42:52.400 --> 42:54.680
can again.

42:54.720 --> 42:57.619
Fun times... you only wanted me around to

42:57.680 --> 42:59.080
show off to your friends that you had a

42:59.119 --> 43:01.280
rich boyfriend.

43:01.280 --> 43:04.460
That's not true.
Okay...

43:04.480 --> 43:06.940
name one place that we went, that didn't

43:06.960 --> 43:08.639
have your high society

43:08.640 --> 43:13.839
friends around?
What do you mean?

43:14.079 --> 43:15.980
We never could go to a regular fast food

43:16.079 --> 43:19.280
restaurant like McDonald's.

43:19.359 --> 43:21.700
You always had to go to those expensive

43:21.760 --> 43:23.960
restaurants.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.499
So, I like good food, not junk food.

43:29.599 --> 43:33.740
How's about we go out to a normal place,

43:33.839 --> 43:36.200
like a karaoke bar and hang out with normal

43:36.240 --> 43:37.180
people.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.620
Are you kidding me those places are

43:39.680 --> 43:41.920
filled with losers and drunks!

43:41.920 --> 43:46.720
So, you're proving my point?
No...

43:47.359 --> 43:50.280
fine, where is this karaoke bar I'll meet

43:50.319 --> 43:51.239
you there.

43:51.280 --> 43:55.839
It's at Hardrider.

44:01.075 --> 44:05.975
Come along, Regina... let's have some fun.
Okay, Shawn...

44:06.000 --> 44:07.839
Ready to have fun...

44:14.640 --> 44:16.200
Hey Shawn, do you mind if I bring Stormy

44:16.240 --> 44:17.940
along?

44:18.000 --> 44:22.619
Yeah, sure... yeah, the more the merrier.

44:22.640 --> 44:25.079
Thanks, Shawn.
My friend, Holly would love

44:25.119 --> 44:26.040
to come...

44:26.079 --> 44:30.240
but I'm gonna go see my boyfriend.

44:37.755 --> 44:39.755
Why does she always have to be so stuck up?

44:41.680 --> 44:46.339
All right, let's go.

45:01.119 --> 45:04.180
Hey mom, what's going on?
Hey honey,

45:04.240 --> 45:05.679
I was just calling to see if you were

45:05.680 --> 45:08.039
done with your dinner party yet?

45:08.079 --> 45:09.779
Yeah, we just finished dinner, we're about

45:09.839 --> 45:11.980
to head out to karaoke.

45:12.079 --> 45:14.840
Oh, okay... I thought you were coming back

45:14.880 --> 45:16.239
home,

45:16.240 --> 45:19.839
but you go ahead and have fun.

45:24.560 --> 45:29.360
No mom, I'll be home in a minute.

45:29.440 --> 45:32.940
Okay honey, thank you.

45:32.960 --> 45:37.440
See you in a minute, okay... bye.

45:45.839 --> 45:49.219
Um, I'm really sorry, Shawn but I'm not

45:49.280 --> 45:53.100
gonna go tonight... mom hasn't been feeling

45:53.119 --> 45:54.400
well and

45:54.400 --> 45:56.340
I just don't want to leave her.
It's okay,

45:56.400 --> 45:59.400
Kalyani, I understand.

45:59.440 --> 46:04.400
Okay, um... bye everyone.

46:08.935 --> 46:10.935
Bye, Kalyani.

46:10.960 --> 46:13.939
Bye, Shawn.

46:15.839 --> 46:17.500
Hey Shawn, thanks again for letting Stormy

46:17.520 --> 46:19.139
tag along.
Hey,

46:19.200 --> 46:22.839
anything for my little sister.

46:34.720 --> 46:36.639
Guess if we're going out, Regina...
I guess I

46:36.720 --> 46:38.039
don't need this on.

46:47.139 --> 46:49.759
Don't need a monkey suit anyway.

50:07.040 --> 50:09.520
Good job, Holly.
Thank you, Shawn.

50:10.659 --> 50:14.219
Please welcome our next singer, Bailey.

50:14.559 --> 50:18.280
Shawn, you're gonna sing?
Yeah, I think so.

50:18.319 --> 50:20.460
Shawn, it's bad enough you brought us out

50:20.480 --> 50:22.959
here, now you're gonna
humiliate yourself as

50:22.960 --> 50:24.559
well?

50:24.559 --> 50:27.339
Hey, you don't have to sing, but I came

50:27.359 --> 50:27.800
out here

50:27.839 --> 50:31.200
to have fun.
Good for you,

50:31.200 --> 50:34.360
baby...
Regina, that's the first time you've

50:34.400 --> 50:35.720
referred to me

50:35.760 --> 50:38.640
as anything but Shawn in front of people.

50:38.720 --> 50:41.040
I'm sorry...

50:42.020 --> 50:45.059
No, I liked it, sweetie...

50:50.555 --> 50:53.155
Is everything okay, Shawn?

50:53.280 --> 50:56.269
Yeah, everything's fine... got my song,

50:56.320 --> 50:58.469
I'm gonna take it up.

51:29.200 --> 51:32.000
Hey Shawn, how's karaoke night going?

51:32.080 --> 51:36.360
Kalyani, we need to talk.
What's going on?

51:37.200 --> 51:40.879
I got a big problem.
What's wrong?

51:40.960 --> 51:42.000
I think I'm falling in love with,

51:42.079 --> 51:44.400
Regina.

51:45.839 --> 51:47.819
Shawn, did you just say that you're

51:47.839 --> 51:51.020
falling in love with your own robot?

51:51.119 --> 51:53.500
Kalyani, this is serious what am I

51:53.520 --> 51:55.160
gonna do?

51:55.200 --> 51:57.759
What do you mean, what are you gonna do?

51:57.760 --> 51:59.340
I gotta try to stop myself from feeling

51:59.359 --> 52:00.600
this way, that's not what I built her

52:00.640 --> 52:02.800
for.

52:02.839 --> 52:06.400
Shawn... okay, I know this wasn't your

52:06.400 --> 52:07.140
intention,

52:07.200 --> 52:10.619
but now you just have to stop looking at

52:10.640 --> 52:13.080
her as your robot.

52:13.119 --> 52:15.219
If you're in love with her, you need to

52:15.280 --> 52:17.080
treat her like any other girl

52:17.119 --> 52:19.260
that you're in love with.
How am I

52:19.280 --> 52:20.960
supposed to do that?

52:20.960 --> 52:24.160
Easy... just be yourself

52:24.160 --> 52:28.160
and don't think of her as a robot,

52:28.160 --> 52:32.120
think of her as a girl that you love.

52:32.160 --> 52:35.459
Thanks, Kalyani.
And Shawn remember,

52:35.520 --> 52:38.539
if you mess this relationship up... I got

52:38.559 --> 52:42.639
dibs on her next.

52:43.414 --> 52:47.114
Yeah, sure you do... bye.

52:47.639 --> 52:49.080
Bye.

53:40.319 --> 53:42.539
I didn't know Maggie could sing
Yeah,

53:42.559 --> 53:43.780
must be one of those hidden talents

53:43.839 --> 53:45.620
she's been keeping from us.

54:37.040 --> 54:40.400
Good job, Maggs... I'm proud of you.

54:40.480 --> 54:46.000
Thanks, Shawn.
All right, up next is Shawn.

55:01.200 --> 55:04.139
This is for Regina, the love of my life.

56:28.839 --> 56:31.719
So, have all you kids been keeping

56:31.760 --> 56:34.139
this hidden talent from me?

56:34.319 --> 56:37.039
Pretty much... definitely.

57:16.720 --> 57:18.020
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get me a

57:18.079 --> 57:21.000
drink.
Okay, sweetie.

59:04.559 --> 59:06.720
Well done, Shawn... you just gave me my

59:06.799 --> 59:09.479
perfect way to get you back.

59:09.520 --> 59:12.040
What are you talking about?
I propose

59:12.079 --> 59:14.180
that both me and your girl...

59:14.240 --> 59:17.640
Regina, do a song and

59:17.680 --> 59:19.360
whoever gets the best reaction out of

59:19.440 --> 59:20.880
this crowd is the one that you'll be

59:20.960 --> 59:22.340
with,

59:22.480 --> 59:25.419
that is if Regina isn't afraid.
You know

59:25.440 --> 59:27.099
what Ria,

59:27.119 --> 59:31.580
that's a great idea, but if she beats you,

59:31.599 --> 59:35.220
you don't get to come around me anymore.

59:35.280 --> 59:39.460
You're on, but when I beat her,

59:39.520 --> 59:42.159
she has to do the same thing with you.

59:42.160 --> 59:43.280
Okay...

59:43.359 --> 59:46.819
you got a deal, write down your song.
Okay...

59:46.880 --> 59:49.060
thanks, you're as good as mine again, I

59:49.119 --> 59:50.939
didn't win all those singing contests as

59:50.960 --> 59:53.139
a kid for nothing.

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:19.500
Okay Regina, now I want you to

1:00:19.520 --> 1:00:22.500
analyze this video, so you can sing this

1:00:22.539 --> 1:00:25.539
song.
Okay, Shawn...

1:01:00.079 --> 1:01:03.380
Hey man, my girlfriend and my

1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:05.259
ex-girlfriend here,

1:01:05.280 --> 1:01:07.320
are going to do a competition, can you

1:01:07.359 --> 1:01:08.699
inform the crowd?

1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:13.599
Sure thing man, no problem, sounds cool.

1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:20.099
Get used to a lot of that because your

1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:22.739
retard of a girlfriend stands no chance

1:01:22.799 --> 1:01:25.839
beating me.

1:01:31.119 --> 1:01:34.739
How are you coming sweetie?
Analysis complete...

1:01:34.799 --> 1:01:39.839
Ready to kick her ass, baby...

1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:48.180
What did I miss?
Ria just challenged Regina

1:01:48.240 --> 1:01:50.380
to a karaoke competition.

1:01:51.104 --> 1:01:53.104
How come I always miss the good stuff?

1:01:55.520 --> 1:01:58.339
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're about to

1:01:58.400 --> 1:01:59.819
get interactive...

1:01:59.839 --> 1:02:02.240
the next two singers coming up on stage

1:02:02.319 --> 1:02:04.180
will be doing a competition

1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:07.600
for the biggest crowd reaction, our first

1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:08.339
competitor

1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:11.839
is the lovely, Ria!

1:05:34.640 --> 1:05:38.480
Beat that you loser...

1:05:44.559 --> 1:05:46.820
All right, let's keep this competition

1:05:46.880 --> 1:05:47.839
rolling,

1:05:47.920 --> 1:05:51.439
up next is Regina!

1:06:20.240 --> 1:06:23.439
This is for you, Shawn.

1:10:55.199 --> 1:10:57.260
I've always been competitive and I'm not

1:10:57.280 --> 1:10:59.300
used to losing...

1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:02.740
so, I'm not a good loser, but tonight

1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:07.040
the best girl won, congratulations.

1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:14.400
Goodbye, Shawn.
Ria, stop...

1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:18.760
come here, look

1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:23.340
I know the agreement was if you lost

1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:24.799
that you could never come around me

1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:29.199
again, but I think I was wrong...

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:34.140
you really do care about me.
I do.

1:11:34.159 --> 1:11:36.640
Then I don't see any reason why we can't

1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:39.039
remain friends.

1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:42.160
Is that okay with you, Regina?

1:11:42.239 --> 1:11:46.900
Any friend of Shawn's is a friend of mine.

1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:50.239
Thank you, thank you both.

1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:58.140
Okay, first I think we need to get this

1:11:58.239 --> 1:11:59.759
Regina girl

1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:02.060
in here and we'll get her to get the

1:12:02.159 --> 1:12:03.739
rest of them

1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:06.140
in here for us.
Okay, you wait here, I'll

1:12:06.239 --> 1:12:09.840
go bring her in.

1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:15.000
Ah, hi Regina, Dr. Doug Wheeler would like

1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:16.340
to see you for a moment in the spare

1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:17.440
room.

1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:23.840
Okay, Matthew...

1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:27.679
She's coming.

1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:34.340
Hello Dr. Wheeler, what did you want to

1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:39.420
see me about?
Look into my crystal, Regina...

1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:42.300
you will do whatever I want you to won't

1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:43.540
you?

1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:47.039
No, I will not...

1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:50.180
Yes, yes you will, just

1:12:50.239 --> 1:12:52.820
look into the crystal... you are falling

1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:55.480
into a deep trance.

1:12:55.520 --> 1:12:59.240
I am not...
Yes,

1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:02.579
yes you are, you are

1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:07.620
in a deep trance!
I don't

1:13:07.679 --> 1:13:10.320
think so...

1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:15.600
Hang on!
Okay, Dr...

1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:18.480
I don't understand it... I've never had

1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:20.800
anybody not fall under my control.

1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:23.920
So, what are you gonna do now?
I, I'm just

1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:24.300
gonna

1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:26.320
ask... see if she'll go get each one of

1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:27.520
these people and bring them back here

1:13:27.520 --> 1:13:29.920
for us.

1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:34.060
Sorry about that, Regina...
um, could you do

1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:34.880
me a favor

1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:37.260
and run and get Sharon for me, so we can

1:13:37.280 --> 1:13:38.880
discuss that, uh business deal that we

1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:40.839
were talking about last night.

1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:44.220
Okay, Dr. I will bring her to

1:13:44.239 --> 1:13:48.320
meet with you...
Thank you.

1:13:56.239 --> 1:14:00.040
Mama Kent, Dr. Wheeler would like to

1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:03.820
see you...
Don't call me that!

1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:05.080
I guess it's about that business

1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:06.839
proposal that we're talking about at

1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:08.180
dinner last night.

1:14:08.239 --> 1:14:12.420
I do not know, he would not tell me.

1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:15.920
Figures, well where are they?
He and

1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:19.120
Matthew are waiting for you in the spare

1:14:19.140 --> 1:14:21.060
room...

1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:31.300
Hi Dr. Wheeler, you wanted to see me?
Yeah,

1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:32.379
Sharon...

1:14:32.400 --> 1:14:35.679
please call me Doug.
Oh... yes, Doug.

1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:39.620
Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.

1:14:39.679 --> 1:14:41.060
So, I guess this is about that business

1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:42.500
proposal we discussed at dinner

1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:43.560
yesterday.

1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:46.959
Indeed it is you know this business

1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:48.060
deal

1:14:48.159 --> 1:14:51.340
is going to make me... excuse me,

1:14:51.360 --> 1:14:55.359
make us a lot of money.

1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:58.120
Go ahead, I'm listening.
Sharon, let me

1:14:58.159 --> 1:14:59.040
show you

1:14:59.120 --> 1:15:05.500
what will make us all of that money.

1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:16.340
Sharon, can you hear me?
Yes, Doug...

1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:19.020
Good and you're ready to listen to me

1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:20.239
and only me?

1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:24.180
Yes, Doug to you and only you...
Sharon,

1:15:24.239 --> 1:15:26.820
how much money do you have in this house

1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:28.300
right now?

1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:31.580
About $155,000 in the bedroom...

1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:34.839
Okay, do you have any other valuables

1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:38.180
in this house?
Yes, I do...

1:15:38.239 --> 1:15:41.260
Good, now I need you to go get them

1:15:41.280 --> 1:15:43.720
and bring them back to me, you understand?

1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:45.840
Yes, Doug...

1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:53.840
Good, now go do as I said.
Yes, Doug...

1:15:55.440 --> 1:15:59.080
Very profitable indeed...

1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:03.280
Regina, would you please come back in here?

1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:08.940
Yes, Dr...
Can you please tell, Aisha

1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:11.419
that I need to see her too?

1:16:11.440 --> 1:16:13.800
Okay, Dr...

1:16:20.719 --> 1:16:25.539
Aisha, Dr. Wheeler would like to see you...

1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:28.140
What does he want to see me for?
I do not

1:16:28.239 --> 1:16:28.980
know

1:16:29.040 --> 1:16:32.040
he would not tell me...
I don't blame him,

1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:35.840
I wouldn't give you much info either.

1:16:37.040 --> 1:16:38.759
Hey Dr. Wheeler, you said you needed to

1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:40.060
see me?
Yes

1:16:40.159 --> 1:16:43.300
Aisha, please call me Doug.
I prefer

1:16:43.360 --> 1:16:45.999
Dr. Wheeler.
Suit yourself, please have a

1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:47.140
seat,

1:16:47.199 --> 1:16:49.040
make yourself comfortable.
What's all

1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:51.420
this about?

1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:55.060
So, we have a business proposition that

1:16:55.120 --> 1:16:57.740
you might be interested in getting in on.

1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:00.840
It's not like our family needs money, we're

1:17:00.840 --> 1:17:03.840
rich.
But wait,

1:17:03.840 --> 1:17:09.040
look at this craftsmanship.

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:17.360
Aisha, can you hear me?
Yes, Dr. I can

1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:19.360
hear you...

1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:22.919
You're ready to listen to me and only me?

1:17:22.960 --> 1:17:26.719
Yes, Dr. I will listen to you
and only you...

1:17:28.719 --> 1:17:31.239
How much money do you have in your room?

1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:32.159
I have about

1:17:32.239 --> 1:17:36.060
$15,000 in my bedroom safe...

1:17:36.159 --> 1:17:38.959
Do you have any other valuables, jewelry,

1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:40.100
etc.

1:17:40.159 --> 1:17:43.980
Yes, I do...
Okay, now you will go get them

1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:47.279
and bring them back to me, understood?
Yes,

1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:49.679
Dr...

1:17:49.920 --> 1:17:53.600
Good, now go.

1:17:57.520 --> 1:18:02.000
Regina, can you please come back in here?

1:18:04.159 --> 1:18:07.080
Yes, Dr...
I need you to do the same

1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:08.460
with Maggie for me,

1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:11.680
please?
Understood...

1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:14.880
Command accepted...

1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:23.240
It's almost like I have her under my

1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:25.040
control...

1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:33.760
Hey bro, working on a new piece of tech?

1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:36.560
Something like that.

1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:41.840
Where's your girlfriend?

1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:45.480
Maggs, I wish you wouldn't call her my

1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:47.219
girlfriend.

1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:50.660
Sorry... so where is Regina?
I guess she's

1:18:50.719 --> 1:18:52.920
downstairs.

1:18:52.960 --> 1:18:55.460
Everything all right with you two?\
Yeah,

1:18:55.520 --> 1:18:57.699
everything's great.

1:18:57.760 --> 1:18:59.160
Good, you know I'm probably the only

1:18:59.199 --> 1:19:00.480
person in this family that likes her

1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:03.259
and wants you two together.

1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:06.079
You really like her, huh?
Definitely, she's

1:19:06.159 --> 1:19:07.640
a little different, but a huge

1:19:07.679 --> 1:19:11.040
improvement over that witch, Ria.

1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:15.100
Well, Ria kind of, uh redeemed herself

1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:16.360
last night.

1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:18.520
Yeah, I know... anyways I gotta look after

1:19:18.560 --> 1:19:21.080
my big brother, right?

1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:26.480
I will let to get back to work.
Later, Maggs.

1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:36.480
Maggie, Dr. Wheeler would like to

1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:40.440
see you in the spare room...

1:19:40.480 --> 1:19:43.840
Okay, Regina... what does he want?

1:19:43.840 --> 1:19:47.340
He would not tell me...
Okay, Regina...

1:19:47.340 --> 1:19:49.440
thanks.

1:19:52.560 --> 1:19:55.280
Uh, hi Dr. Wheeler, you wanted to see me
Hey,

1:19:55.360 --> 1:19:58.480
Maggie... call me Doug.
Okay, Doug.

1:19:58.880 --> 1:20:02.400
Have a seat make yourself comfortable.

1:20:03.520 --> 1:20:06.720
Now what's this all about?
So, your mother

1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:07.440
tells me

1:20:07.520 --> 1:20:09.839
that you've been having difficulty

1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:12.220
concentrating in school.

1:20:12.239 --> 1:20:14.320
No more than anyone else, why would she

1:20:14.320 --> 1:20:15.860
come to you about that?

1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:19.700
Because I have a really great relaxation

1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:21.540
technique that I think you would greatly

1:20:21.600 --> 1:20:24.840
benefit from.

1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:40.120
Maggie, can you hear me?
Yes, Dr...

1:20:40.159 --> 1:20:43.440
You're ready to listen to me and only me?

1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:47.500
Yes, Dr. I'll listen to you and only you...

1:20:47.840 --> 1:20:50.360
How much money do you have in your room?

1:20:50.400 --> 1:20:53.360
About $10,000...

1:20:53.679 --> 1:20:57.540
Any other jewelry, valuables, etc.

1:20:57.600 --> 1:21:00.960
Yes, I do.
Good,

1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:02.940
now you will go get them and bring them

1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:05.000
back to me, understood?

1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:08.359
Yes. Dr...
Good,

1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:10.999
now go.

1:21:14.159 --> 1:21:19.199
Regina, can you please come back in here?

1:21:22.080 --> 1:21:25.179
Yes, Dr. what would you like me to do

1:21:25.199 --> 1:21:27.580
now?
Hey Regina, we need you to get your

1:21:27.679 --> 1:21:28.800
boyfriend, Shawn

1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:30.360
and have him come in here, me and Matthew

1:21:30.400 --> 1:21:31.680
have something we need to discuss with

1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:32.440
him.

1:21:32.480 --> 1:21:35.240
Understood... command accepted...

1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:47.179
Mom, what are you doing?
I'm giving Dr.

1:21:47.199 --> 1:21:47.619
Wheeler

1:21:47.679 --> 1:21:50.660
all our money and valuables...

1:21:50.719 --> 1:21:54.560
Why... he's a psychiatrist not a

1:21:54.840 --> 1:21:57.840
televangelist?

1:22:10.639 --> 1:22:12.700
Aisha, you're not going to believe...
Can't talk

1:22:12.719 --> 1:22:14.779
now Shawn, must get my money

1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:16.900
and valuables ready for Doug...
What is

1:22:17.679 --> 1:22:19.540
going on with you two?

1:22:19.600 --> 1:22:25.840
We must give our money to Doug...

1:22:35.760 --> 1:22:40.000
Maggs, you mind if I come in?
Sure, Shawn...

1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:43.380
You are not going to believe what's

1:22:43.440 --> 1:22:45.239
going on with

1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:48.239
Aisha and Mom... oh no, not you too.

1:22:50.239 --> 1:22:52.480
I must get all my money...
I know and you

1:22:52.480 --> 1:22:55.260
have to give them to Dr. Wheeler!

1:22:55.280 --> 1:22:58.540
Oh, you understand, would you like to help?

1:22:58.560 --> 1:23:02.959
No... I'm gonna go back to my room and

1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:06.139
try and figure out what's going on.
Okay,

1:23:06.159 --> 1:23:08.639
have fun...

1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:18.980
Shawn, I have been looking for you...

1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:22.440
Why is that, Regina?
Dr. Wheeler

1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:25.419
and Matthew Hudson wanted me to find you

1:23:25.440 --> 1:23:26.699
and bring you to

1:23:26.719 --> 1:23:31.140
the spare room...
Why do they want to see me?

1:23:31.199 --> 1:23:35.840
I do not know, they would not tell me...

1:23:35.920 --> 1:23:37.979
Are they doing anything strange in there?
Not

1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:39.619
that I could tell,

1:23:39.679 --> 1:23:42.620
but the Dr. did want to show me his

1:23:42.719 --> 1:23:43.439
crystal

1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:46.540
for some reason...
Crystal...

1:23:46.639 --> 1:23:49.780
what crystal?
I do not know,

1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:52.879
a crystal he seems to keep on a chain in

1:23:52.880 --> 1:23:55.679
his pocket...

1:23:57.040 --> 1:24:01.100
That's it, he hypnotized them!

1:24:01.120 --> 1:24:05.600
What is hypnotized?

1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:12.980
Regina, I want you to

1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:16.840
watch this video and analyze it.

1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:18.640
Okay, Shawn... analyzing...

1:24:19.464 --> 1:24:21.464
If you can really cure my head...

1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:42.240
Tracking, tracking...

1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:45.840
You shall see nothing,

1:24:46.159 --> 1:24:49.280
hear nothing,

1:24:49.360 --> 1:24:52.880
dream of nothing,

1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:56.719
but Svengali...

1:24:56.840 --> 1:24:59.840
Svengali...

1:24:59.864 --> 1:25:01.864
Svengali...

1:25:01.920 --> 1:25:05.400
So, if he waves that crystal in your face

1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:06.360
again,

1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:08.480
this time you'll act like you're

1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:11.220
hypnotized by him,

1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:15.120
and pretend to be under his control.

1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:18.580
Analysis complete... I now know

1:25:18.639 --> 1:25:22.420
what is hypnotized and can effectively

1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:25.480
pretend to be hypnotized...

1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:29.260
Good, all right... just go back to the room

1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:30.939
and tell them

1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:34.540
you couldn't find me.
But Shawn, I did find

1:25:34.639 --> 1:25:35.380
you...

1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:38.800
Yeah, but he doesn't know that.
Oh

1:25:38.880 --> 1:25:41.999
I think I understand, you're teaching me

1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:43.139
about

1:25:43.199 --> 1:25:46.580
lying...
Now you're getting a picture.

1:25:46.639 --> 1:25:51.279
Picture?
Now, you understand.

1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:55.620
Yes, Shawn... now I understand...

1:25:55.679 --> 1:25:59.080
All right, so go to the room, just make

1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:00.040
sure

1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:01.840
that you record all of their

1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:03.399
conversation when they think that they

1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:05.180
have you hypnotized,

1:26:05.199 --> 1:26:06.820
that way I'll know exactly what their plan

1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:09.100
is.
Okay, Shawn...

1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:12.000
I understand...

1:26:21.360 --> 1:26:24.340
I'm sorry, Dr. I was not able

1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:27.440
to find Shawn...

1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:34.940
Is there anything else I can do

1:26:34.960 --> 1:26:37.840
to be of service?

1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:42.239
Give me one moment.

1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:45.800
So, what are we going to do now, we have

1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:48.379
to get Shawn in here.

1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:51.620
Don't worry, I think I can get Regina

1:26:51.679 --> 1:26:53.920
fully under my control.

1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:57.520
How... it didn't work last time?

1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:00.560
I think I have that part figured out now,

1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:02.940
I just need to get Regina to relax before I

1:27:02.960 --> 1:27:05.840
show her the crystal.

1:27:05.920 --> 1:27:09.260
Okay, give it a shot.

1:27:09.280 --> 1:27:11.760
Dr...

1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:14.080
Okay, Regina... this is what I need you to

1:27:14.159 --> 1:27:16.040
do, I want you to go ahead and have a seat

1:27:16.080 --> 1:27:19.840
right here.

1:27:21.760 --> 1:27:25.039
I need you to sit here and become

1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:26.619
completely relaxed

1:27:26.639 --> 1:27:28.640
and release all of the stress out of

1:27:28.719 --> 1:27:33.840
your body.

1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:44.840
And why are we doing this again,

1:27:44.840 --> 1:27:47.840
Dr...

1:27:53.679 --> 1:27:57.040
Regina, can you hear me?

1:27:57.040 --> 1:28:01.840
Yes, Doug... I can hear you...

1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:06.319
What's wrong?
I can't tell... she seems to

1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:08.620
talk like that all the time.

1:28:08.719 --> 1:28:11.439
Well, just test her out then.

1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:20.140
Regina, you are ready to do whatever I say,

1:28:20.239 --> 1:28:24.739
right?
Yes, I will do whatever you say...

1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:32.580
You will go get Shawn

1:28:32.639 --> 1:28:36.839
and bring him back in here, won't you?

1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:40.180
Yes, I will find Shawn and bring him back

1:28:40.239 --> 1:28:40.880
here

1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:44.480
to you...
Good...

1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:50.039
So, we'll send her back to get him,

1:28:50.080 --> 1:28:52.160
when she brings him back in here, I'll

1:28:52.239 --> 1:28:54.560
hypnotize him,

1:28:54.560 --> 1:28:57.680
get him to sign your military contract...

1:28:57.760 --> 1:29:00.880
then when his mother and his two sisters

1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:03.280
come back in here with all their money

1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:04.399
and jewelry,

1:29:04.480 --> 1:29:07.140
and everything else that we want, we'll

1:29:07.199 --> 1:29:07.820
grab it,

1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:13.120
and get out of here.
Sounds like a plan.

1:29:14.239 --> 1:29:17.359
Okay, Regina... you will go

1:29:17.440 --> 1:29:20.100
and do as I commanded and bring Shawn

1:29:20.159 --> 1:29:22.379
back in here.

1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:27.679
Yes, whatever you say, my master...

1:29:35.280 --> 1:29:38.060
I have never had someone so far under my

1:29:38.159 --> 1:29:39.319
control

1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:42.679
they called me master.
Well...

1:29:42.719 --> 1:29:45.679
congratulations.

1:29:49.520 --> 1:29:53.060
So, how'd it go?
I must obey,

1:29:53.120 --> 1:29:57.360
Dr. Wheeler now...
What?

1:30:03.280 --> 1:30:07.800
Just kidding...

1:30:07.840 --> 1:30:11.939
Regina, you...

1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:14.560
I taught you how to lie, but you're not

1:30:14.639 --> 1:30:16.940
supposed to use that on me...

1:30:16.960 --> 1:30:21.840
I'm your creator.
I'm sorry, Shawn...

1:30:23.360 --> 1:30:26.680
Did you, uh did you get it recorded?

1:30:26.719 --> 1:30:30.840
Yes, I recorded all of
their conversation...

1:30:30.880 --> 1:30:35.840
Good, sit down.

1:30:35.864 --> 1:30:37.864
Alright, let's see what we got.

1:30:41.215 --> 1:30:45.515
Transfering, transfering, transfering...

1:30:47.040 --> 1:30:50.239
Transfer complete...

1:30:51.120 --> 1:30:54.800
Send her back to get him, when she brings

1:30:54.880 --> 1:30:55.940
him back in here,

1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:59.360
I'll hypnotize him get him to sign your

1:30:59.440 --> 1:31:01.700
military contract,

1:31:01.760 --> 1:31:04.800
then when his mother and his two sisters

1:31:04.800 --> 1:31:06.800
come back in here with all of their

1:31:06.800 --> 1:31:08.399
money and jewelry,

1:31:08.400 --> 1:31:11.140
and everything else that we want, we'll

1:31:11.199 --> 1:31:11.799
grab it

1:31:11.840 --> 1:31:17.140
and get out of here.
Sounds like a plan.

1:31:17.199 --> 1:31:18.960
Can't believe Matthew's in on this with

1:31:19.040 --> 1:31:20.480
him.

1:31:20.560 --> 1:31:24.420
What are we going to do, Shawn?

1:31:24.480 --> 1:31:27.520
I got a plan, I want you to use your

1:31:27.520 --> 1:31:29.859
lasers in your eyes to infuse a shield

1:31:29.920 --> 1:31:32.060
over the lenses on my glasses to protect

1:31:32.159 --> 1:31:32.520
me

1:31:32.560 --> 1:31:36.240
from Doug's hypnosis.
Okay, Shawn...

1:31:36.320 --> 1:31:39.040
Fusing lenses now...

1:31:47.360 --> 1:31:50.639
Fuse complete...

1:31:50.960 --> 1:31:52.700
Okay, all right...

1:31:58.400 --> 1:32:00.400
I want you to snap out the rest of the

1:32:00.400 --> 1:32:01.540
family from the trances,

1:32:01.600 --> 1:32:05.440
I'm gonna call the police.
Okay, Shawn...

1:32:14.080 --> 1:32:18.439
Move, Regina... I must get by...
No...

1:32:18.480 --> 1:32:20.600
I must give all my money to Dr. Wheeler,

1:32:20.639 --> 1:32:21.559
move...

1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:24.159
I'm sorry...

1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:28.620
Maggie, when I snap my fingers, you will

1:32:28.719 --> 1:32:29.460
remember

1:32:29.520 --> 1:32:32.900
everything Dr. Wheeler did to you...

1:32:32.960 --> 1:32:35.100
Yes, I understand, I will remember

1:32:35.140 --> 1:32:37.040
everything...

1:32:40.800 --> 1:32:45.380
Maggie, are you okay?

1:32:45.440 --> 1:32:48.420
Yeah, thanks Regina... how could he do this

1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:49.840
to us?

1:32:49.920 --> 1:32:52.959
Oh... mom, Aisha...

1:32:53.040 --> 1:32:56.080
It is okay, Shawn will take care of

1:32:56.159 --> 1:32:58.819
everything, you just need to wait here

1:32:58.880 --> 1:33:00.719
until the police arrive.

1:33:00.719 --> 1:33:04.640
Now, go put your valuables and
money away...

1:33:04.719 --> 1:33:09.840
Thanks, Regina.
No problem, Maggs.

1:33:16.719 --> 1:33:19.119
Let me through, we must give our money to

1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:20.620
Doug...

1:33:20.719 --> 1:33:22.319
I'm sorry...

1:33:26.719 --> 1:33:29.899
Why do I have this?
Dr.

1:33:29.920 --> 1:33:33.160
Wheeler, he hypnotized you

1:33:33.199 --> 1:33:35.720
and told you to give him all of your

1:33:35.760 --> 1:33:36.320
money

1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:40.280
and valuables...
Oh my god!

1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:42.879
It's okay, Shawn has already called the

1:33:42.880 --> 1:33:43.620
police,

1:33:43.679 --> 1:33:45.840
why don't you go wait with maggie until

1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:47.540
the police arrive...

1:33:47.540 --> 1:33:50.540
Okay.

1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:09.060
Stop...
Move out of my way...

1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:11.760
I'm sorry...

1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:19.139
What is this?
Dr. Wheeler, he

1:34:19.199 --> 1:34:22.200
hypnotized you to try to take

1:34:22.239 --> 1:34:25.999
all of your money and valuables...

1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:29.159
I'll kill him!
No, Shawn will

1:34:29.199 --> 1:34:32.120
take care of him, go and put your stuff

1:34:32.159 --> 1:34:33.120
away,

1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:36.320
and meet with the rest of the family

1:34:36.320 --> 1:34:39.440
and wait for the police...

1:34:39.520 --> 1:34:43.440
Fine, just wait on the cops.

1:34:49.440 --> 1:34:52.560
Are you ready to do this?

1:34:52.639 --> 1:34:55.760
As ready as I'll ever be,

1:34:55.920 --> 1:34:59.040
you make this look good.
I will...

1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:01.840
All right, let's do it.

1:35:08.639 --> 1:35:11.640
I brought Shawn to you, my master...

1:35:11.679 --> 1:35:15.840
Let me go!
Thank you, Regina.

1:35:23.920 --> 1:35:27.780
What did you do to her?
Same thing that I did

1:35:27.840 --> 1:35:30.060
to the rest of your family,

1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:31.860
the same thing that I'm about to do to

1:35:31.940 --> 1:35:34.620
you.

1:35:34.644 --> 1:35:36.644
No your not.

1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:46.320
I'm not looking at it!

1:35:52.239 --> 1:35:55.340
Look at the crystal, you cannot

1:35:55.360 --> 1:35:57.840
resist...

1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:04.660
Shawn, can you hear me?
Yes,

1:36:04.719 --> 1:36:10.940
I can hear you...
You can let him go, Regina.

1:36:10.960 --> 1:36:13.439
Are you ready to listen to me and only

1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:14.200
me?

1:36:14.239 --> 1:36:18.340
Yes, I will listen to you and only you...

1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:25.840
Good, Matthew... contract.

1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:33.040
You will sign this contract.

1:36:33.064 --> 1:36:35.064
I will sign the contract...

1:36:37.280 --> 1:36:39.960
Hey, hey... settle down, stop which one

1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.540
of you is Shawn?

1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:45.440
That would be me!

1:36:46.159 --> 1:36:48.960
What do you have for me?

1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:53.860
This guy has been hypnotizing my family

1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:54.560
members

1:36:54.560 --> 1:36:56.560
trying to get them to give him all of

1:36:56.560 --> 1:36:59.339
their money and he tried to hypnotize me

1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:02.620
to sign this contract!

1:37:02.639 --> 1:37:05.719
These are outrageous and
untrue accusations!

1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:08.640
Hey, calm down now, let him
finish... let me see

1:37:08.719 --> 1:37:09.420
what you got?

1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:13.460
Listen to that.
When she brings him

1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:16.880
I'll hypnotize him get him to sign your

1:37:16.960 --> 1:37:19.200
military contract,

1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:22.400
then when his mother and his two sisters

1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:24.739
come back in here with all their money

1:37:24.800 --> 1:37:26.220
and jewelry,

1:37:26.239 --> 1:37:30.240
everything else that we want, grab it

1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:35.840
Thank you, you're coming with me!

1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:41.600
You are not going anywhere...

1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:45.180
Ah, thank you.

1:37:45.199 --> 1:37:50.480
I got it, come on.

1:37:52.239 --> 1:37:56.159
I love you.
I know...

1:37:57.679 --> 1:38:00.080
Let's go.

1:38:00.719 --> 1:38:04.079
Stay. Officer. Yes
This one here the

1:38:04.159 --> 1:38:05.620
Dr.

1:38:05.679 --> 1:38:08.320
he's got the crystal he used to
hypnotize them...

1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:10.299
Where?
In his front pocket.

1:38:10.320 --> 1:38:13.199
What, what is this?

1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:17.840
Where'd you get this from?

1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:20.700
You don't know how lucky you are, if these

1:38:20.719 --> 1:38:22.400
police officers weren't here, I do a hell

1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:24.360
of a lot worse then that to you,

1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:27.360
get them out of my sight!

1:38:29.199 --> 1:38:33.119
I see it, now your supposed to go.

1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:40.480
Matthew, we were like brothers...

1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:44.820
Yet you betray me for a stupid contract!

1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:47.860
Get him out of my sight!
All right,

1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:51.019
what contract... let's go!

1:38:54.880 --> 1:38:56.980
Yeah, the cop is driving off with Matthew
and

1:38:57.040 --> 1:38:58.839
that creepy Dr. Wheeler

1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:02.220
in the back of the squad car.

1:39:02.239 --> 1:39:04.260
Well, I hate to say it, but thank goodness

1:39:04.320 --> 1:39:06.560
for Shawn and his girlfriend Regina.

1:39:06.560 --> 1:39:08.939
Yeah, I know Shawn and Regina really came

1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:10.620
through for the family when we really

1:39:10.639 --> 1:39:12.300
needed them.

1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:14.720
Yeah, if it weren't for them, you would

1:39:14.800 --> 1:39:15.480
have lost

1:39:15.520 --> 1:39:18.860
all your money to that weirdo.
I know, I

1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:19.319
know,

1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:23.119
I get it.
So...

1:39:23.119 --> 1:39:27.039
maybe you should lighten up on the
two of them from now on.

1:39:27.119 --> 1:39:30.140
You're right, maybe Shawn isn't the unless

1:39:30.239 --> 1:39:33.760
nerd that I thought he was, but Regina's

1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:35.360
just so odd,

1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:39.280
this is gonna be tough.
Come on, babe.

1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:44.880
Okay, okay... I'll try.
That's my girl.

1:39:52.239 --> 1:39:55.240
I guess maybe I was too harsh with you

1:39:55.280 --> 1:39:59.240
welcome to the family.

1:40:00.864 --> 1:40:02.864
Hey, can't I get in on this?

1:40:11.679 --> 1:40:14.480
Oh, come here, baby.

1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:23.780
I was looking for you Shawn why are you

1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:28.040

and action

1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:44.870
Yeah it would be different if you'd make

1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:46.320
an actual career out of it

1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:49.280
you should sign a military deal with

1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:52.480
your friend Matthew Broderick

1:42:52.719 --> 1:42:56.000
Matthew Hudson, oh my god.
