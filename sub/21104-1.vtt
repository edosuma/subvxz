00:41.108 --> 00:45.645
And all he left was a note...
A note!

00:45.647 --> 00:47.514
Know what it said?

00:47.516 --> 00:51.518
One day there is no more time.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.587
After 32 years of marriage...

00:54.589 --> 00:59.192
As if that whole time,
I was holding him prisoner.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.431
It wasn't my fault.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.178
Merry Christmas, you sheeny
fuck.

02:25.180 --> 02:26.179
Who you doing in Cali?

02:26.181 --> 02:29.015
What do you mean, you're off?

02:29.017 --> 02:31.518
It's Christmas fucking Eve day.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.521
So where you jetting to anyway?

02:34.523 --> 02:35.989
Carmel Valley tennis range.

02:35.991 --> 02:41.794
Ooh, fancy... the views?

02:41.796 --> 02:42.662
Screw the redwoods.

02:42.664 --> 02:45.698
Flash a yard on the bar, you'll
get more pussy than the ASPCA.

02:45.700 --> 02:48.468
And go for stewardesses.

02:48.470 --> 02:50.503
They always leave.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.976
Ho. Ho. Ho.

02:56.978 --> 02:58.278
Merry fucking Christmas.

02:58.280 --> 03:02.482
What the fuck are you
doing here?

03:02.484 --> 03:04.017
Bringing Christmas cheer.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.388
Why don't you just fuck off?

03:08.390 --> 03:10.790
Ray, put the club down
for one minute.

03:10.792 --> 03:11.958
I don't have a lot of time.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.893
Oh, right, no, busy man.
Places to go.

03:13.895 --> 03:15.328
People to screw.

03:15.330 --> 03:17.830
Knock yourself out, Ray.
I don't work for you anymore.

03:17.832 --> 03:21.701
Not for ten glorious years
have I had to endure your shit.

03:21.703 --> 03:22.969
My shit.

03:22.971 --> 03:25.405
Yeah, what about that hot pile
you plotzed outside there.

03:25.407 --> 03:27.073
It's old news.
Bullshit, old news.

03:27.075 --> 03:28.708
You think people in this mall
don't know?

03:28.710 --> 03:30.310
Karly Reagan runs out on me.

03:30.312 --> 03:33.980
Chris received day rump
shift, leaves me short-handed.

03:33.982 --> 03:36.849
Then he gipes the night drop.
And what did I say?

03:36.851 --> 03:39.485
I said he's just a kid,
he's young, he'll learn.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.554
Let it go, and I let
it fucking go.

03:41.556 --> 03:44.824
And I fed you product
below cost.

03:44.826 --> 03:45.825
You got your money back.

03:45.827 --> 03:48.528
What about my reputation?
Huh? My character.

03:48.530 --> 03:50.330
Parts of that are
still fucking missing.

03:50.332 --> 03:52.498
And you know what, jerk?

03:52.500 --> 03:55.235
Even after you fucking
went to lion, what did I do?

03:55.237 --> 03:57.937
I fed you serious volume.
I know.

03:57.939 --> 04:01.407
Hey, Ray, man, oh fuck,
you're off the charts, wow.

04:01.409 --> 04:05.678
Ray, baby, these days
you're not even on the charts.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.547
Flat couple of years, yeah.

04:07.549 --> 04:09.415
Sure.

04:09.417 --> 04:12.218
Oh, so you're the salesman now.

04:12.220 --> 04:14.754
You push a product
that sells itself.

04:14.756 --> 04:18.524
A five-year-old in a cheap
suit could do your job.

04:18.526 --> 04:21.261
Oh, really, well, I guess this
is a misprint then, huh?

04:21.262 --> 04:25.198
Karl Reagan, senior vice
president of sales...

04:25.200 --> 04:26.466
Eastern seaboard.

04:26.468 --> 04:28.768
Ray, I'm senior VP of sales
for the biggest film...

04:28.770 --> 04:30.737
Manufacturer in the world.

04:30.739 --> 04:32.538
You're a counter clerk.

04:32.540 --> 04:35.074
Yeah, why don't you take that
wheelbarrow of your shit show...

04:35.076 --> 04:36.643
And take it on down to Yorktown.

04:36.645 --> 04:38.645
How about that?

04:38.647 --> 04:40.813
Ray, you need to listen to this.
Why?

04:40.815 --> 04:42.482
Because it's about you.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.753
You blow in here at the crack
of dawn to show me...

04:46.755 --> 04:48.788
the future.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.726
A prototype.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.428
Final production model.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.299
Wow.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.568
Huh... look at that.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.470
You wait ten seconds...

05:04.472 --> 05:06.439
Then you get to admire the
shittiest fucking picture...

05:06.441 --> 05:09.242
Ever taken in the history
of shitty fucking pictures.

05:09.244 --> 05:10.777
Look at that face.

05:10.779 --> 05:12.412
Senior vice president of sales,
I don't know.

05:12.414 --> 05:15.782
You look a little worried.
Why?

05:15.784 --> 05:17.617
600,000 units.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.120
You're fucked, Boyo.

05:21.122 --> 05:24.290
So there's no shot
that I can move these.

05:24.292 --> 05:25.758
You ever use one of these?

05:25.760 --> 05:27.460
I hate photography.

05:27.462 --> 05:30.697
What the fuck? The biggest film
manufacturer in the world...

05:30.699 --> 05:36.169
For the past 100 years trying,
has never made a great camera.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.305
They think they own the market.
Bullshit.

05:39.307 --> 05:41.641
Pride goeth before the fall,
my friend.

05:41.643 --> 05:44.811
The market is people.

05:44.813 --> 05:46.312
You don't sell
people the cameras.

05:46.314 --> 05:48.214
You invite them
in to fall in love...

05:48.216 --> 05:50.516
With a process or a product.

05:50.518 --> 05:53.319
Look, Ray, I'm not you.
I'm not that smart...

05:53.321 --> 05:55.988
But I know when to leave.

05:55.990 --> 05:59.726
Some nip Einstein will build a
better one. It's coming, Ray.

05:59.728 --> 06:00.793
The whole world is going
digital.

06:00.795 --> 06:03.363
What the fuck? You're still
playing the...

06:03.365 --> 06:04.831
"Oh, I'm only here to help poor,
old Ray" card.

06:04.833 --> 06:06.833
You prognosticate the future
of photography, for what?

06:06.835 --> 06:09.902
To save me? Bullshit.
To save yourself.

06:09.904 --> 06:12.071
Jesus Christ, Ray.

06:12.073 --> 06:15.575
I come in here bearing gifts
and what do I get in return?

06:15.577 --> 06:16.909
A recap of what a shit I am...

06:16.911 --> 06:18.678
And the misery of listening
to you...

06:18.680 --> 06:20.413
Twist the very virtues
you used to believe in...

06:20.415 --> 06:22.849
In order to justify
your paralysis.

06:24.017 --> 06:28.054
Ray, your plan to move on, the
one-hour-photo thing, it's good.

06:28.056 --> 06:30.590
Well, how do you know
about that?

06:30.592 --> 06:32.992
Cafritz over at Yorktown...

06:32.994 --> 06:35.395
Said you were thinking about
opening a one-hour-photo booth.

06:35.397 --> 06:37.430
That fat fuck has been shaking
in his boots...

06:37.432 --> 06:39.732
Ever since you've been talking
about it for five years.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.567
Well, I'm in talks
with Fuji right now.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.370
Mike Nakimura.
What, you know him?

06:44.372 --> 06:45.438
I lit the afterburners for you.

06:45.440 --> 06:48.541
I told Nakimura you were ready
to rock right after the first.

06:48.543 --> 06:52.912
In seven days.

06:52.914 --> 06:57.750
1995... the year of Ray Lapine.
But here's the catch, Ray.

06:57.752 --> 07:01.521
The slopes vet everything
and everyone.

07:01.523 --> 07:03.423
They're gonna want to
take a look at your books.

07:03.425 --> 07:06.459
So whatever number the valley
gives you, you gotta hit it.

07:06.461 --> 07:09.028
To the fucking penny.

07:09.030 --> 07:13.366
Now, show 'em who you
really are, you get a new life.

07:13.368 --> 07:17.737
Fuck up, you die
in this joint, Ray.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.040
Merry Christmas.

07:21.042 --> 07:22.542
Oh, fuck.

07:34.388 --> 07:35.955
<i>Operator you have
reached the offices...</i>

07:35.957 --> 07:38.424
<i>Of Mike Nakimura at Fuji film
north America.</i>

07:38.426 --> 07:39.959
<i>We are currently closed.</i>

07:39.961 --> 07:43.463
<i>Our holiday hours are 10 A.M.
to 5 P.M.</i>

07:44.898 --> 07:46.966
Son of a bitch.

07:53.607 --> 07:56.108
Hey, boss man,
how you doing, sir?

07:56.110 --> 07:57.276
Eh.

07:57.278 --> 08:00.079
Same old Ray... different day.

08:00.081 --> 08:04.250
Here you go, Ray...
The usual.

08:04.252 --> 08:07.253
Hey, let me ask you a question.

08:07.255 --> 08:09.455
When are you going to get rid
of that piece of shit...

08:09.457 --> 08:10.990
That you drive?

08:10.992 --> 08:13.693
You live 45 yards away
from this place...

08:13.695 --> 08:17.530
And yet every single morning,
I see you driving in backwards?

08:22.202 --> 08:23.636
Merry Christmas, Ray.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.873
So what's the difference
between this place and prison?

08:26.875 --> 08:29.375
The food's better in prison.

08:29.377 --> 08:30.843
I told you that already, right?

08:30.845 --> 08:33.946
Yeah, last Christmas. Hey, I got
some interesting news.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.114
You interested?

08:35.116 --> 08:37.549
Christmas, man...
Christmas fucking Eve, huh?

08:37.552 --> 08:40.620
I swear to you, this is my
last one... my last one.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.289
How long, Tonia. How many?
What, 22, 23 years?

08:43.291 --> 08:46.025
24.
Fuck.

08:46.027 --> 08:47.827
Well, you know what, though?

08:47.829 --> 08:49.462
At least you work
for your own pocket.

08:49.464 --> 08:51.030
I gotta fucking bibideaux.

08:51.032 --> 08:53.165
Doesn't even know what
real work is anymore.

08:53.167 --> 08:55.468
Christmas Eve, where's he?
Boca.

08:55.470 --> 08:58.404
And what's he doing?
Golfing.

08:58.406 --> 09:02.208
Well, as long as he
signs the checks.

09:02.210 --> 09:06.512
I swear, next year...
you're gonna be your own man?

09:06.514 --> 09:08.414
I catch Nakimura
today, it's a done deal.

09:08.416 --> 09:10.082
On a holiday?

09:10.084 --> 09:10.917
Nips don't take holidays.

09:10.919 --> 09:11.918
They die at their desks.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.553
And you know the
beauty is the loan.

09:13.555 --> 09:16.656
I mean, the manufacturer is
the lender, so there is no bank.

09:16.658 --> 09:18.024
There's no middleman.

09:18.026 --> 09:19.725
Paperwork is a mere formality.

09:19.727 --> 09:23.229
Need a couple of clean
references... $25,000.

09:23.231 --> 09:25.097
You know what Nakimura tells
me? Look at this.

09:25.099 --> 09:26.666
This new model...

09:28.769 --> 09:31.270
Puts out 400 prints, huh.

09:31.272 --> 09:33.272
That's per hour.

09:33.274 --> 09:36.042
The space, I gotta carry, so.

09:36.044 --> 09:39.245
You know, I'm thinking
the main atrium.

09:39.247 --> 09:41.847
Heaviest traffic flow.
Cash cow.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.616
The beauty of it is
all that cream goes...

09:43.618 --> 09:45.851
Right in my pocket.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.754
Eh, you know, the novelty,
though.

09:48.756 --> 09:51.123
What do you mean?
What do you mean, novelty?

09:51.125 --> 09:53.359
I think it's worn off
a little bit.

09:53.361 --> 09:54.193
I mean, those machines,
you see them.

09:54.195 --> 09:57.930
Oh. Uh, you see one here?

09:57.932 --> 09:59.398
No.
No? Did I miss it?

09:59.400 --> 10:01.200
I mean, in this
mall, do you see one?

10:01.202 --> 10:03.202
No, I do not.
No, you do not.

10:03.204 --> 10:04.236
That's because there isn't one.

10:04.238 --> 10:06.939
And I'll tell you something
else. The closest one?

10:06.941 --> 10:08.641
And I've done this
research myself.

10:08.643 --> 10:09.442
Two miles away.

10:09.444 --> 10:12.712
And those greedy bastards,
they just raised their prices.

10:12.714 --> 10:15.982
No. No. Yes, it's novel enough,
novel enough to make a fortune.

10:15.984 --> 10:18.150
But first I gotta
get through next week.

10:18.152 --> 10:22.254
And Tonia, what do I
hate about next week?

10:22.256 --> 10:23.456
The returns?

10:23.458 --> 10:25.391
Ugh, the returns.

10:25.393 --> 10:26.959
Buy something this week,
bring it back next week...

10:26.961 --> 10:28.127
Every fucking time.

10:28.129 --> 10:30.396
You know, little junior.

10:30.398 --> 10:32.832
My husband Ralph of 22 years...

10:32.834 --> 10:34.800
And aunt Bertha
just couldn't work it.

10:34.802 --> 10:37.303
She didn't like it.
It was too complicated.

10:37.305 --> 10:40.306
Yamma-nah, yamma-nah...

10:40.308 --> 10:41.741
And I got to write it all up.

10:41.743 --> 10:44.276
And you, my dear, can have
sympathy for my plight...

10:44.278 --> 10:46.012
But you can't have
any empathy...

10:46.014 --> 10:50.316
Because no one has ever brought
back a slice of pizza next week.

10:50.318 --> 10:53.452
Oh, fuck it. What do I owe
you for the bun?

10:53.454 --> 10:56.489
Eh... I got to get some
of that movie film.

10:56.491 --> 10:58.591
You know, the kid's coming
by tonight.

10:58.593 --> 11:00.526
Just come by later, all right?

11:00.528 --> 11:02.962
All right. I will.

11:02.964 --> 11:04.530
Hey, keep your blood
pressure down, will you?

11:04.532 --> 11:09.035
Yeah, uh, blood pressure.
Look, the warden... aw, Jesus.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.139
Ray! Ray! I've been looking
all over for you.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.642
This fell... nearly tripped
and broke my leg...

11:16.644 --> 11:18.310
Over the goddamned thing.

11:18.312 --> 11:20.479
You want to put it down
and try again?

11:20.481 --> 11:25.017
Ray, Ray, there's such a thing
as retail operating strictures..

11:25.019 --> 11:26.452
In this state... codes?

11:26.454 --> 11:28.554
Not to mention how it looks.

11:28.556 --> 11:30.189
What?
Your store.

11:30.191 --> 11:31.991
It's an eyesore in <i> my</i> mall.

11:31.993 --> 11:33.626
I'm trying to run a classy
joint here.

11:33.628 --> 11:36.228
Just so you know, people that
use the word class...

11:36.230 --> 11:39.665
Usually do not have that which
they purport to invoke.

11:39.667 --> 11:42.802
No, I got no time for your
conundrums today, all right?

11:42.804 --> 11:45.371
I got an installation
to supervise.

11:45.373 --> 11:47.006
Eyesore?
That's what I said.

11:47.008 --> 11:49.475
Well, no, actually what
you said was...

11:49.477 --> 11:51.844
"Your store," meaning mine,
Ray Lapine's store...

11:51.846 --> 11:55.147
Is an eyesore in your mall.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.816
Your, in the latter sense
meaning you...

11:56.818 --> 11:59.585
Felix Potemkin, mall manager.

11:59.587 --> 12:02.054
Now, that's exactly what you
said, isn't it, little junior?

12:02.056 --> 12:05.091
You got no cause to demean...

12:05.093 --> 12:06.392
you know, we should straighten
this out, all right?

12:06.394 --> 12:07.993
Firstly, this is not my store.

12:07.995 --> 12:08.661
Right?

12:08.663 --> 12:09.729
I'm simply the manager.

12:09.731 --> 12:11.831
I'm like the
financial custodian.

12:11.833 --> 12:13.766
Like the president of a bank,
for instance.

12:13.768 --> 12:15.735
Yes, or something like
that, that's what I am.

12:15.737 --> 12:18.738
And secondly, this is not
your mall.

12:18.740 --> 12:21.407
What you are is a bouffant
jerk who walks around...

12:21.409 --> 12:24.610
In squeaky cheap shoes listening
to the Musak all day...

12:24.612 --> 12:27.046
And the carping of old ladies,
and occasionally...

12:27.048 --> 12:30.583
You do make yourself useful when
you spread that pink powder...

12:30.585 --> 12:32.718
Over puddles of puke
you encounter...

12:32.720 --> 12:34.887
Before you have the janitorial
staff scurry over...

12:34.889 --> 12:37.223
Like it's a fucking train wreck
and actual lives...

12:37.225 --> 12:39.558
Are at stake, all right.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.726
What you are, Felix...
no cause!

12:40.728 --> 12:44.430
Do not interrupt me, all right?
You are a functionary.

12:44.432 --> 12:46.465
Which is one step above
lackey...

12:46.467 --> 12:48.467
Which is a first cousin
to flunky...

12:48.469 --> 12:51.303
Which is only a gnat's
eyelash from being the chief...

12:51.305 --> 12:54.540
Counter monkey at a
Kentucky fried chicken.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.111
I'm having a serious talk
with Mr. B.

12:59.113 --> 13:00.613
Yeah, fine. Call him in boca.

13:00.615 --> 13:03.549
See if you can get
him off the 19th tee.

13:03.551 --> 13:06.418
Excuse me, are you Ray?
Half hour.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.055
We open at 9:30.

13:10.057 --> 13:13.125
Oh, no, I'm not a customer.
I'm here to work.

13:13.127 --> 13:14.827
Yeah, all right, fine.
I know who you are, all right.

13:14.829 --> 13:16.762
So you weren't looking where
you were going...

13:16.764 --> 13:17.897
You got mud on your clothes...

13:17.899 --> 13:19.965
And now you want money from me
for dry cleaning.

13:22.769 --> 13:26.806
Sir, I'm here to work with you.

13:26.808 --> 13:29.942
And what are you? Some rump man
sent over by employment?

13:29.944 --> 13:32.778
Is that what, relief?
Right? And you want in?

13:32.780 --> 13:36.248
I mean, you want to be here
on Christmas fucking Eve day...

13:36.250 --> 13:38.617
To what, stand by the register
and collect commission...

13:38.619 --> 13:40.786
While I spend 364 days...

13:40.788 --> 13:44.190
no, fuck that, 23 fucking
years setting this up and now...

13:44.192 --> 13:47.193
You're going to swoop in,
take money out of my pocket.

13:47.195 --> 13:49.161
Is that what money means to you,
young man?

13:49.163 --> 13:52.498
Let me tell you something.
You make a mistake.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.933
When you make money, you're god.

13:53.935 --> 13:55.134
I'm sorry, I...

13:55.136 --> 13:57.636
and if you want in,
you have to ask.

13:57.638 --> 14:00.139
You have to have the
brass clock-knockers to say...

14:00.141 --> 14:02.341
Mr. Lapine, I want in.

14:02.343 --> 14:05.010
Well, Mr. Lapine, I want in.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.478
Fuck you.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.282
But Mr. Bibideaux said...

14:10.284 --> 14:11.483
yeah, he's in Florida.

14:11.485 --> 14:12.785
No, he's here.

14:12.787 --> 14:14.353
You saw him? He's here?

14:14.355 --> 14:17.022
Well, he was at my house
for dinner last night.

14:18.425 --> 14:21.961
He had dinner at your... I see.

14:21.963 --> 14:23.829
And what's your name, dog ears?
Pete.

14:23.831 --> 14:25.965
And where are you on vacation
from?

14:25.967 --> 14:28.067
Wharton.
Of course.

14:28.069 --> 14:32.004
So last night over Beaujolais
in, what, upper nyack, Mr. B...

14:32.006 --> 14:33.906
Discovered that you're a buff,
you like to take pictures.

14:33.908 --> 14:35.674
So he said, "hey, why don't
you go down to my store...

14:35.676 --> 14:37.076
"Work Christmas Eve day...

14:37.078 --> 14:39.345
"Make a little extra money
for the holidays, right?"

14:39.347 --> 14:40.479
Is that it?
No.

14:40.481 --> 14:41.513
I don't know anything
about photography.

14:41.515 --> 14:43.382
He said I could learn
something about business...

14:43.384 --> 14:45.584
From you.

14:45.586 --> 14:48.821
Polaroid film.
Sir?

14:48.823 --> 14:51.423
Triple pack? How many boxes?

14:51.425 --> 14:53.659
Oh, no, I actually don't
have a Polaroid camera.

14:53.661 --> 14:55.995
Two boxes. Very good choice,
sir. Excellent film.

14:55.997 --> 14:57.696
That will be $72.

14:57.698 --> 14:59.164
Oh, you know what?
Don't bother about it.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.033
Because if you're short of cash,
I'll just take it out of your

15:01.035 --> 15:04.103
envelope when the checks
come down this evening.

15:04.105 --> 15:07.840
Lesson number one...
I sell film.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.732
Did you ever see kismet?

16:06.734 --> 16:08.133
Huh? Nah, of course,
you didn't.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.936
You're far too young,
aren't you? Far too young.

16:10.938 --> 16:16.442
Yep... Sean Connery and I did
that show in London... 1962.

16:16.444 --> 16:19.812
Sean was there for his
youthful good looks.

16:19.814 --> 16:22.948
I was there for my tenor voice.

16:22.950 --> 16:26.652
And you know what they said?
The cognoscenti?

16:26.654 --> 16:29.288
Pinky Steuben is going
to be a star, they said.

16:29.290 --> 16:31.090
Not Sean Connery.

16:31.092 --> 16:33.158
Pinky fucking Steuben.

16:33.160 --> 16:37.930
But, as we both know,
that was not meant to be.

16:37.932 --> 16:40.466
I mean, these days Sean Connery
could run me down...

16:40.468 --> 16:42.601
In his rolls Royce and he
wouldn't know who I was.

16:42.603 --> 16:44.470
Unless I told him or sang
for him.

16:44.472 --> 16:46.672
Which would be highly unlikely
if I was lying dead...

16:46.674 --> 16:49.308
Under the wheels of his car.

16:49.310 --> 16:50.943
Ray!

16:50.945 --> 16:54.046
Top of the morning to ya,
me old cocker...

16:54.048 --> 16:58.183
On this blessed
Christmas Eve day?

16:59.953 --> 17:03.789
Oh, B's back from Florida.

17:03.791 --> 17:06.892
Before Christmas?
Mm.

17:06.894 --> 17:09.461
Well, that don't compute.
Hm.

17:09.463 --> 17:12.464
Are the checks in yet?
No.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.032
Oh, well, it's a bit early,
isn't it?

17:14.035 --> 17:15.701
Who the fuck am I talking to?

17:15.703 --> 17:18.203
Rump man... Pete.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.972
Pete.

17:19.973 --> 17:22.141
Well, I'm certainly glad
it's not Helen.

17:22.143 --> 17:25.077
'Cause she looks really awful.
Ha, ha, ha.

17:25.079 --> 17:28.146
Pete, me old cocker.
How the heck are you?

17:28.148 --> 17:31.250
I like that name. You know what?

17:31.252 --> 17:34.053
Sounds like an astronaut.

17:34.055 --> 17:38.023
Now, Pete... look, I hope you
don't mind me saying this, Pete.

17:38.025 --> 17:39.725
But I have this thing.

17:39.727 --> 17:43.529
It... it's a salesman's gift.
I know people.

17:43.531 --> 17:46.532
You understand what I mean?
I know people.

17:46.534 --> 17:49.234
And I can tell just looking
at you now...

17:49.236 --> 17:52.738
That you are going to be
a giant in this business.

17:52.740 --> 17:56.241
Pete, you are going to
be a captain of industry.

17:56.243 --> 18:01.046
In fact, you actually
remind me of old bibby himself.

18:01.048 --> 18:02.448
Bibby?

18:02.450 --> 18:05.684
Ah, our nickname for our
beloved employer, Mr. Bibideaux.

18:05.686 --> 18:07.453
There is something
in the eyes, you see.

18:07.455 --> 18:10.422
There is something in the eyes.
They are sharp.

18:10.424 --> 18:13.525
They are very, very sharp.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.260
Ray.
Pinky.

18:15.262 --> 18:18.897
Um, I need a break, but...

18:18.899 --> 18:21.133
you're shy of funds.

18:23.536 --> 18:27.806
A mind reader... a regular
Edgar Cayce, this man.

18:27.808 --> 18:32.244
Hey, Ray, you don't think
that young Pete...

18:32.246 --> 18:35.781
do you think that Pete
is feeling Christian?

18:35.783 --> 18:36.482
I couldn't speak for him.

18:36.484 --> 18:38.283
Well, of course you
couldn't speak for him, Ray.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.083
Of course, you
couldn't speak for him.

18:40.085 --> 18:42.888
Only Pete can speak for Pete.

18:42.890 --> 18:45.891
So what say you, Pete,
old chap, hm?

18:45.893 --> 18:47.593
Help out a friend?

18:50.063 --> 18:54.066
I think I've got...
I've got five dollars.

18:54.068 --> 18:55.734
But that's for lunch.

18:55.736 --> 18:57.669
Maybe Ray could break it.

18:57.671 --> 19:00.339
Oh, Ray won't let you
anywhere near his register.

19:00.341 --> 19:02.608
Guards it like fort Knox.

19:02.610 --> 19:05.577
I, however, may be
able to help you out.

19:05.579 --> 19:06.845
But...

19:06.847 --> 19:08.514
he won't let me near it, either.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.820
Oh, he himself has said it...

19:14.822 --> 19:19.625
And it's frightening,
to his credit.

19:19.627 --> 19:23.028
Oh, you gorgeous, buxom thing,
you.

19:23.030 --> 19:25.264
<i>Woman
welcome, valley shoppers...</i>

19:25.266 --> 19:26.999
<i>To the green
at green meadows mall.</i>

19:27.001 --> 19:30.669
<i>It's now 10:00 A.M.
enjoy your shopping day.</i>

19:39.445 --> 19:44.850
Dave? Ha-hey!
You're never gonna get it.

19:44.852 --> 19:49.221
Oh, well, guess. Why can't you
guess? It's just a...

19:49.223 --> 19:53.692
penny... Wednesday.

19:53.694 --> 19:57.062
Penny Wednesday...
From Grossinger's?

19:58.565 --> 20:04.169
The phone book... yeah,
you're right here on page 113.

20:05.939 --> 20:10.042
Hold on a sec.
You off your meds?

20:11.444 --> 20:14.580
It's nothing, Dave, just some
creep smitten with my beauty.

20:14.582 --> 20:16.181
<i>Receptionist
Mr. Nakimura's office.</i>

20:16.183 --> 20:18.650
Ah, yes, hi, good morning.
Mr. Nakimura, please?

20:18.652 --> 20:21.486
You said call if I ever
made it down.

20:21.488 --> 20:22.754
Well, I'm down.

20:22.756 --> 20:24.256
<i>Receptionist
may I ask who's calling?</i>

20:24.258 --> 20:26.258
Yes, this is Ray Lapine.

20:26.260 --> 20:28.060
Just for the day.

20:28.062 --> 20:30.495
Unless I can find
some place to stay.

20:30.497 --> 20:33.565
<i>Receptionist
we have your information.</i>

20:33.567 --> 20:35.334
Oh, you have it. Excellent.

20:35.336 --> 20:37.369
I didn't call for money.

20:37.371 --> 20:41.106
I just... thought we had a love
connection, that's all.

20:41.108 --> 20:43.842
Is there another time
today that I could call back?

20:43.844 --> 20:46.078
<i>Receptionist maybe
try him in an hour and a half.</i>

20:46.080 --> 20:49.748
Okay, that's fine. 90 minutes.
Can we commit to that?

20:49.750 --> 20:50.949
<i>Receptionist
you'll just have to try him.</i>

20:50.951 --> 20:53.185
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>
Yes, Merry Chr...

20:53.187 --> 20:57.522
tonight? You got a wife,
don't you, Dave?

20:57.524 --> 20:59.558
You swore up and down you
didn't...

20:59.560 --> 21:02.127
And I am just stupid enough.

21:02.129 --> 21:04.763
I'm not so stupid,
I don't know I'm dumb, okay?

21:08.401 --> 21:12.804
Hey. Employment booth.
Second level.

21:12.806 --> 21:16.074
Tell Lorraine that
Ray Lapine sent you.

21:16.076 --> 21:20.312
Yeah... and why would
Ray Lapine do that?

21:25.218 --> 21:30.255
Whatever it is, he's not
gonna let it go.

21:30.257 --> 21:33.225
That's Ray, you see,
he's like the Irish.

21:33.227 --> 21:35.560
He loves his misery.

21:35.562 --> 21:39.064
Talking of misery,
are you married?

21:39.066 --> 21:42.467
No, of course you're not,
of course, you're not.

21:42.469 --> 21:46.838
You're a living example of that
proposition which states...

21:46.840 --> 21:51.009
Not all men are fools,
some are bachelors.

21:51.011 --> 21:52.778
Ba-boom.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.094
So, you're married?

22:09.096 --> 22:10.996
Oh, five times.

22:13.700 --> 22:19.938
Yep. Five times married and
five beautiful wives.

22:19.940 --> 22:23.342
Now once, on my honeymoon
with Lorna.

22:23.344 --> 22:28.213
Lorna, French Canadian,
god, was she hot.

22:28.215 --> 22:33.719
We were a couple.
I mounted her like a stallion.

22:33.721 --> 22:37.823
This was not lovemaking in a
convention sense, Pete.

22:37.825 --> 22:42.127
This was more like some
sort of nature film.

22:51.304 --> 22:53.505
Hey. What's going on
down there?

22:55.241 --> 22:58.477
Something new... there's always
something new.

22:58.479 --> 23:01.246
Yeah.

23:03.349 --> 23:06.818
You want to get laid and I know
you do... where do you go, eh?

23:06.820 --> 23:09.888
Bars? Parties? Night clubs?

23:09.890 --> 23:11.323
Wrong!

23:11.325 --> 23:12.991
Wrong.

23:12.993 --> 23:16.027
Launderettes.

23:16.029 --> 23:18.096
There are women there, Pete.

23:18.098 --> 23:20.165
I Grant you, most of them
are married...

23:20.167 --> 23:24.202
But there are bona fide women
there nonetheless.

23:24.204 --> 23:31.009
And did you know the incidents
of venereal disease...

23:31.011 --> 23:36.281
Transmission in launderettes
is low.

23:36.283 --> 23:37.616
Really?

23:37.618 --> 23:40.185
Extremely low.

23:40.187 --> 23:42.354
And I am speaking
from experience here.

23:42.356 --> 23:43.555
Yeah.

23:43.557 --> 23:44.689
And you know the best thing?

23:44.691 --> 23:46.858
No pretension... no hard to get.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.795
It's just eye contact besides
the industrial dryers...

23:49.797 --> 23:52.564
And two minutes later, you're
doing it on top of the Maytag.

23:52.566 --> 23:55.400
And do you know how
they look afterwards?

23:55.402 --> 23:58.270
How?
Grateful. And why?

23:58.272 --> 24:01.440
And this is the best part...
no pretension.

24:04.343 --> 24:06.445
I thought that was
the best part.

24:06.447 --> 24:07.813
Nah.

24:07.815 --> 24:10.449
You're a very literal soul,
aren't you.

24:11.551 --> 24:17.656
Oh! As I live and breathe,
here is the man.

24:17.658 --> 24:20.792
How are you, Tony?
How are things?

24:20.794 --> 24:24.763
52 bucks, pinky. And I want it
by Monday, no more bullshit.

24:24.765 --> 24:27.432
And you shall have it.

24:27.434 --> 24:29.801
Any news about the checks?

24:29.803 --> 24:30.969
They're not here yet.

24:30.971 --> 24:33.905
B-but... why not?

24:33.907 --> 24:36.575
Paramus, Pearl river,
white plains.

24:36.577 --> 24:39.911
Ah, but not in Nanuet.

24:39.913 --> 24:42.681
They weren't ready yet.
No.

24:42.683 --> 24:45.951
I expect they will be
by tonight, yeah?

24:45.953 --> 24:51.823
Well, happy Christmas to you
and yours.

24:51.825 --> 24:53.325
Monday.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.761
Drunk ass motherfucker.

25:13.479 --> 25:15.480
Who are you, Wayne Newton?

25:16.415 --> 25:19.885
Felix Potemkin, mall manager.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.556
Yeah.

25:27.393 --> 25:28.894
I have a friend.

25:28.896 --> 25:31.463
No names, at the moment,
because we're just supposing...

25:31.465 --> 25:34.966
Two perfect strangers talking
for an instant in eternity...

25:34.968 --> 25:36.635
Neither wanting
anything from the other.

25:36.637 --> 25:38.236
Is this a long story?

25:39.505 --> 25:42.474
Perhaps I can be helpful
with your employment situation.

25:42.476 --> 25:44.743
Following which you
might join me for lunch...

25:44.745 --> 25:47.345
At my private table
in the Macy's tea room?

25:49.181 --> 25:51.082
Are you a spaz or what?

25:51.084 --> 25:55.587
Maybe I'm that candy-colored
clown, maybe not.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.394
I'll think about it.
Okay.

26:11.338 --> 26:13.371
Come in. May I help you?

27:00.486 --> 27:03.088
Mr. Lapine...

27:03.090 --> 27:04.789
What are you doing?

27:07.893 --> 27:11.596
Quality control...
Checking the exposure.

27:11.598 --> 27:14.799
Grain... paper quality.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.671
Well, aren't those private?

27:19.673 --> 27:22.941
Let me ask you a question.
What do you think?

27:22.943 --> 27:24.476
Oh, god.

27:24.478 --> 27:27.846
Yeah, do you think
she's having fun?

27:27.848 --> 27:30.849
I don't think she's
a Wharton girl.

27:30.851 --> 27:36.488
Maybe Julliard. Oh yeah...
Flautist.

27:36.490 --> 27:39.257
You recognize the guy
in that thing?

27:39.259 --> 27:40.992
Maybe from the club?

27:44.764 --> 27:48.767
That's Dr. Lobell.
He's a gynecologist.

27:50.536 --> 27:52.103
Appears he is.

27:55.708 --> 27:58.643
I don't think that's his wife.

27:58.645 --> 28:01.846
Uh, no, I don't think so.
Oh-o.

28:01.848 --> 28:04.049
But that is.

28:06.752 --> 28:08.687
Mrs. lobell...

28:13.559 --> 28:17.228
Well, hi there, Pete.
What are you doing here?

28:17.230 --> 28:20.131
I'm just working for a paycheck.

28:20.133 --> 28:21.900
Young Peter and I were
just discussing you.

28:21.902 --> 28:23.368
Oh?

28:23.370 --> 28:25.570
Actually I was defending you
and the doctor.

28:25.572 --> 28:27.572
I was defending your choice...

28:27.574 --> 28:29.641
Of taking your business
to Yorktown camera.

28:29.643 --> 28:30.575
I mean, here at bibideaux...

28:30.577 --> 28:33.344
All we can do is offer
25 years of unflagging service.

28:33.346 --> 28:36.648
Yorktown is cheaper.

28:36.650 --> 28:37.315
And certainly I don't mean
that in a tawdry way.

28:37.317 --> 28:38.483
I really have to run.

28:38.485 --> 28:39.584
But let me just finish...

28:39.586 --> 28:44.022
Because I was very surprised by
some of the photos...

28:44.024 --> 28:46.091
That Peter here has
just come across.

28:46.093 --> 28:49.861
Interesting tidbit
about our young Peter.

28:49.863 --> 28:52.097
He likes going through
the photographs.

28:52.099 --> 28:55.166
Quality control, he calls it.

28:55.168 --> 28:56.568
I can't quite explain how
it happened...

28:56.570 --> 28:58.703
But it seems as though we've
come across some photographs...

28:58.705 --> 29:00.171
Of your husband's.

29:00.173 --> 29:04.442
Oh, I... I doubt they're
my husband's.

29:04.444 --> 29:08.279
Ah, how is the good doctor,
by the way?

29:08.281 --> 29:10.782
I thought you knew.

29:10.784 --> 29:12.250
What's that?

29:13.352 --> 29:16.955
They have... they found
a brain tumor.

29:21.694 --> 29:24.963
Um, how long ago?

29:24.965 --> 29:27.766
About a month.

29:27.768 --> 29:30.735
They've done everything
that they can, so...

29:30.870 --> 29:33.438
Mr. Lapine...
I'm so sorry.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.106
These are not your husband's
photos...

29:35.108 --> 29:37.075
At all, Mrs. lobell.

29:37.077 --> 29:39.544
See, Peter, no,
the last name is Lapell.

29:39.546 --> 29:43.648
I'm... I am terribly sorry.
Big mistake.

29:43.650 --> 29:47.085
Please do tell your husband
for me and from everyone here...

29:47.087 --> 29:48.553
I will.

29:51.524 --> 29:53.625
She didn't let me
finish my sentence.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.248
Hey!

30:21.554 --> 30:23.188
I'm sorry.

30:26.458 --> 30:30.495
I'm okay, just gonna stink
for a while.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.873
How... how did you fall in?

30:41.875 --> 30:45.176
Fall? I climbed in,
looking for breakfast.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.146
Not for me, Dorko.

30:56.889 --> 30:59.624
Wow... look at him go.

30:59.626 --> 31:01.125
Her.

31:01.127 --> 31:03.494
And she's hungry.

31:03.496 --> 31:05.897
Vegetarian... just like
her mama.

31:05.899 --> 31:08.867
Poor thing, ain't had
a bite since Kingston.

31:11.103 --> 31:13.738
You want to buy her?
She could use a good home.

31:13.740 --> 31:16.641
Me? Bad luck. Everybody around
me always croaks.

31:16.643 --> 31:18.810
Oh.

31:20.412 --> 31:21.846
You could trade me that watch.

31:21.848 --> 31:24.382
That looks like something
captain James T. Kirk...

31:24.384 --> 31:26.417
Of the USS enterprise
would wear.

31:27.987 --> 31:31.489
Who gave it to you?
Your girlfriend?

31:32.625 --> 31:33.591
My mother.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.097
I should get back.
Oh yeah.

31:39.099 --> 31:40.665
For sure, me, too.

31:40.667 --> 31:42.500
It's freezin' out here.

31:42.502 --> 31:46.337
Would you be a gentleman and
walk me the nice way around?

31:49.975 --> 31:53.878
Wait up. Hold my bunny while I
put on my work uniform?

32:00.452 --> 32:02.186
Hi.

32:02.188 --> 32:03.788
Wow.

32:03.790 --> 32:06.925
Um, I think she's okay.

32:06.927 --> 32:10.428
Cool. I don't want to sell
her anyways.

32:10.430 --> 32:13.031
She and me are going to Paris.

32:13.033 --> 32:14.365
She and I.

32:14.367 --> 32:18.102
She and <i> I</i> are going to Paris.

32:18.104 --> 32:19.904
That's what I said.

32:31.016 --> 32:32.250
Really.

32:33.652 --> 32:36.220
They tried to steal
the Oscar Meyer Weinermobile?

32:36.222 --> 32:38.890
See, Jo Jo and my other
brother Tommy, the fuck up?

32:38.892 --> 32:40.658
They stole the Weinermobile
and were trying to get away...

32:40.660 --> 32:41.993
When the cops showed
up and chased them.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.897
It's not as if you can
hope to blend into traffic.

32:45.899 --> 32:47.899
Stupid, huh?

32:47.901 --> 32:49.334
Oh, it was terrible.

32:49.336 --> 32:50.935
My one brother is in prison
for stealing the truck...

32:50.937 --> 32:52.403
And for running my
other brother over.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.439
I'm sorry.

32:55.941 --> 32:58.176
No, I made it up.

32:58.178 --> 33:01.446
Jo Jo got shot knocking
over a pink dot in L.A.

33:01.448 --> 33:03.681
Poor Mook.

33:03.683 --> 33:05.283
Didn't have a pigeon angel.

33:07.252 --> 33:09.187
You ever try and run
a pigeon over?

33:09.189 --> 33:11.856
No, I have not.

33:11.858 --> 33:14.625
Oh, you're a liar, too.

33:14.627 --> 33:17.662
See everybody tries to gun
them winged roaches over...

33:17.664 --> 33:20.465
But few succeed. Why?

33:20.467 --> 33:22.333
You come speeding up on
some unsuspecting pigeon...

33:22.335 --> 33:25.803
Just clucking away there on the
tarmac and naturally you gun it.

33:25.805 --> 33:27.805
It's your instinct to try to
nail that thing...

33:27.807 --> 33:28.840
Because we're carnivores.

33:28.842 --> 33:31.109
We crave advantage over
the weak, it's our way.

33:31.111 --> 33:33.144
But that pigeon...

33:33.146 --> 33:34.946
He's developed his
own set of responses...

33:34.948 --> 33:36.280
And gun it as you may...

33:36.282 --> 33:38.783
That little guy always flies
away at the last second.

33:39.918 --> 33:41.285
My theory?

33:41.287 --> 33:43.354
Every pigeon's got a teeny,
little, invisible angel...

33:43.356 --> 33:45.456
Riding on their wings that taps
'em on the shoulder and says...

33:45.458 --> 33:48.192
"Hey, stupid, look
out for the Buick!"

33:50.662 --> 33:52.864
Well, they do have eyes.

33:52.866 --> 33:56.634
Those two little holes that
are in the back of their heads.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.305
Eyes?

34:03.275 --> 34:06.577
Well, they see the car coming.

34:08.179 --> 34:11.916
And at the last second fly away.

34:11.918 --> 34:14.318
I liked my answer better.

34:16.855 --> 34:19.190
Me, too.

34:24.329 --> 34:26.330
Hey, dog ears.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.034
I got it. I got it.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.837
Buy me lunch later?

34:32.839 --> 34:34.705
I got an hour.

35:06.405 --> 35:10.708
Memories, Pete... that is what
we have in our hands.

35:10.710 --> 35:11.876
Of course, in the old days...

35:11.878 --> 35:14.212
The film used to come in here
like a river.

35:43.075 --> 35:44.642
You okay there, buddy?

35:51.083 --> 35:52.450
I'm okay.

35:52.452 --> 35:53.918
All right, take a minute,
if you need it.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.453
Maybe I ain't got a minute.

35:58.590 --> 36:01.325
Polaroid film for my
granddaughter's camera.

36:01.327 --> 36:02.627
I don't know the model.

36:02.629 --> 36:04.462
Cost a heck of a lot
fifteen years back.

36:04.464 --> 36:06.964
Does it like fold flat-like?

36:06.966 --> 36:10.034
Right.
Yeah, XS 70.

36:11.203 --> 36:15.540
Give me... this much.

36:17.209 --> 36:21.279
But don't charge me tax.
I don't pay tax.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.951
Pete, behind you in the shelf
underneath there...

36:26.953 --> 36:28.986
There's a drawer there.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.290
Pete, never mind.

36:33.625 --> 36:34.959
Get out of my store.

36:34.961 --> 36:36.561
Do you want to learn something,
dog ears?

36:36.563 --> 36:38.729
Watch this.
What's your problem, pal?

36:38.731 --> 36:40.164
I'm a fucking customer.

36:40.166 --> 36:42.833
No, you're a fucking sub-captain
come shop my store.

36:42.835 --> 36:44.502
See if I'm skimming the drawer.

36:44.504 --> 36:46.737
What's a sub-captain?
Private investigator.

36:46.739 --> 36:49.974
Get the fuck out! Go.
Back up, go, go, go.

36:49.976 --> 36:52.176
You stupid idiot, you come into
my store with a tie clip...

36:52.178 --> 36:53.311
Shaped like handcuffs.

36:53.313 --> 36:54.478
You know how you get those?

36:54.480 --> 36:56.581
You get those after your 25
years on the police force.

36:56.583 --> 36:58.349
Don't you? Get the fuck
out of my store.

36:58.351 --> 37:00.251
Your store... that's a fucking
laugh.

37:00.253 --> 37:02.220
You lifers work one place
long enough...

37:02.222 --> 37:04.021
You think you own the
fucking joint.

37:04.023 --> 37:05.523
Yeah, yeah, well tell
Eddie bibideaux...

37:05.525 --> 37:07.358
Fuck him, from Ray Lapine.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.093
He sent a wheezy, old cop
to shop me?

37:09.095 --> 37:12.163
You sackless fuck!

37:12.165 --> 37:14.398
Merry Christmas.

37:29.048 --> 37:31.582
Bibideaux photographic.

37:34.686 --> 37:38.689
Did you know there is a
new girl at the parrot?

37:38.691 --> 37:41.392
Very talented.

37:41.394 --> 37:46.297
And did you know this young
lady has no idea...

37:46.299 --> 37:49.700
How Nelson Rockefeller died.

37:49.702 --> 37:54.705
Tonight, gentlemen, I have
volunteered to demonstrate...

37:54.707 --> 37:58.943
To this poor unfortunate the
exact circumstances...

37:58.945 --> 38:02.313
Under which one of America's
greatest...

38:02.315 --> 38:04.282
And wealthiest men succumbed.

38:04.284 --> 38:05.583
That was the valley.

38:05.585 --> 38:07.818
And?
I got the number.

38:07.820 --> 38:09.787
Is the runner coming
with the checks?

38:09.789 --> 38:12.623
She didn't know.
Oh... right.

38:12.625 --> 38:14.158
Like it's a state secret.

38:14.160 --> 38:20.131
Hey, Andy at the card store
says that bibby has been seen...

38:20.133 --> 38:23.801
In Pearl river, a great,
Gray Phantom...

38:23.803 --> 38:26.570
Floating down the narrow
streets.

38:26.572 --> 38:28.072
Five grand.

38:28.074 --> 38:29.740
Five grand.

38:29.742 --> 38:31.642
That's the number.

38:31.644 --> 38:34.111
Five fucking grand?

38:34.113 --> 38:36.781
Yes, and we're gonna
hit it to the penny.

38:36.783 --> 38:42.953
Oh, Christ... the company man
Returneth. Five bloody grand!

38:42.955 --> 38:45.189
Is that... is that a lot?

38:45.191 --> 38:48.659
A lot? That is a fucking
insult, mate.

38:48.661 --> 38:51.829
Time was Christmas Eve
morning...

38:51.831 --> 38:54.365
We would do five grand
before noon!

38:54.367 --> 38:56.467
When giants walked the earth.

38:58.270 --> 39:03.841
Tell me, Pete, what is one
percent of 5000 split two ways?

39:03.843 --> 39:06.010
25.
It's fucking nothing, Pete!

39:06.012 --> 39:08.813
Has Ray explained to you
our mission?

39:08.815 --> 39:13.651
Do you know what it is
that Ray and I do here?

39:13.653 --> 39:14.952
You sell film.

39:14.954 --> 39:16.487
This discussion is immaterial.

39:16.489 --> 39:20.024
Ah-ha. Film. Film.

39:20.026 --> 39:24.528
Cameras, lenses, accessories?

39:24.530 --> 39:26.030
Never, Pete.

39:26.032 --> 39:29.867
Don't sell the cameras.
Sell the little crap.

39:29.869 --> 39:31.902
That is our dictum.

39:31.904 --> 39:34.238
And if only that
were the whole story.

39:34.240 --> 39:37.041
But oh, no, no, no. It's much
more interesting than that.

39:37.043 --> 39:41.679
You see, Ray and I are like
a couple of secret agents...

39:41.681 --> 39:44.048
Posing as salesmen.

39:44.050 --> 39:47.184
Yet only allowed to sell five
grand, imagine.

39:47.186 --> 39:53.724
Grown men, commission salesmen
being paid not to sell.

39:53.726 --> 39:55.926
Oh, it looks like
a camera store.

39:55.928 --> 39:58.429
It feels like a camera store.

39:58.431 --> 40:00.498
When in reality...

40:00.500 --> 40:04.101
This whole fucking shop is just
a tax write off for bibby.

40:04.103 --> 40:07.371
Now do you understand
the enormity of it, eh?

40:08.006 --> 40:10.040
Still, immaterial.

40:10.042 --> 40:12.109
And you're getting loud.

40:13.845 --> 40:16.547
Well, what was that saying, Ray?

40:16.549 --> 40:20.551
You know, that... that wonderful
expression you once coined.

40:20.553 --> 40:22.586
The thing about life is...

40:22.588 --> 40:25.689
You know you're going
to be screwed.

40:25.691 --> 40:28.859
The thing that makes
it interesting is...

40:28.861 --> 40:30.361
You never know how.

40:33.865 --> 40:37.568
Ray.
Pinky.

40:39.571 --> 40:41.305
I need a break.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.207
Go ahead.

40:55.555 --> 40:56.921
Last place I was staying...

40:56.923 --> 40:59.457
Was with this guy Dave,
in the Poconos.

40:59.459 --> 41:00.958
All he ate was lox.

41:00.960 --> 41:03.093
Lox, lox, lox and more lox.

41:03.095 --> 41:06.630
Like they were making it illegal
tomorrow or something.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.634
You okay?

41:10.936 --> 41:12.470
Yeah.

41:12.472 --> 41:14.939
Mm... no.

41:17.676 --> 41:19.743
Hey, what happened to the dress?

41:19.745 --> 41:20.578
Funny story.

41:20.580 --> 41:24.315
As it turns out, bunnies
love fruitcake.

41:24.317 --> 41:26.317
Who knew?

41:26.885 --> 41:28.352
So you...

41:28.354 --> 41:30.120
You lost the job?

41:30.122 --> 41:32.356
95 minutes flat.

41:32.358 --> 41:34.492
It happens.

41:35.460 --> 41:37.628
Yeah.

41:37.630 --> 41:39.930
Had to sell the bunny, though.

41:39.932 --> 41:42.766
To the pet store.

41:43.134 --> 41:45.135
8 bucks.

41:45.137 --> 41:48.272
I made 'em swear they wouldn't
feed her to a snake, though.

41:55.313 --> 41:57.181
Hold out your hand.

42:00.252 --> 42:01.952
Wow.

42:02.621 --> 42:03.988
What a life line.

42:03.990 --> 42:05.456
Look at that thing.

42:05.458 --> 42:06.557
Huh.

42:06.559 --> 42:07.825
What?

42:07.827 --> 42:10.628
Well, you see the way your
fingers clinch right here?

42:10.630 --> 42:13.130
Money is important.

42:13.665 --> 42:15.833
Also, you're a virgin.

42:16.768 --> 42:18.569
You can tell from looking
at my hand?

42:18.571 --> 42:19.570
No.

42:19.572 --> 42:22.973
From the way you were looking
at me on the bus this morning.

42:27.646 --> 42:28.913
I'm sorry.

42:28.915 --> 42:31.916
Oh, don't be, I was
complimented.

42:32.684 --> 42:33.884
How old are you, anyway?

42:33.886 --> 42:35.486
I'm 19.

42:35.488 --> 42:37.087
How about you?

42:37.656 --> 42:39.757
Now Pete, didn't your mother
ever teach you...

42:39.759 --> 42:40.991
About asking a woman her age?

42:40.993 --> 42:41.725
Mm-mm.

42:41.727 --> 42:43.727
It's very rude.

42:44.796 --> 42:48.432
Gees, 19 and handsome
as you are...

42:48.434 --> 42:50.534
And you never even tried it?

42:50.869 --> 42:53.337
I'm waiting.

42:53.339 --> 42:54.572
It was once.

42:54.574 --> 42:56.607
Yes, there it is! I knew it.

42:56.609 --> 42:58.709
It was the senior class trip
to France.

42:58.711 --> 43:00.377
It was this little town.

43:00.379 --> 43:02.413
Beautiful, huh?

43:03.848 --> 43:07.284
It was on top of this hill.

43:07.286 --> 43:10.387
And below was...

43:10.389 --> 43:12.923
This valley.

43:12.925 --> 43:15.392
And it was just full of those
purple flowers.

43:15.394 --> 43:17.795
Oh, lavender.
Yeah, yeah.

43:17.797 --> 43:20.965
Oh, I like this story.

43:20.967 --> 43:23.467
And, well, later that night
they, um...

43:23.469 --> 43:25.769
They gave us this big dinner.
Mm-hm.

43:25.771 --> 43:28.138
And it had wine and everything.

43:28.140 --> 43:32.543
My god, even the kids drink
over there, little rummies.

43:32.545 --> 43:34.478
Later on, my girlfriend
and I went down...

43:34.480 --> 43:35.212
oh, wait, wait, wait!

43:35.214 --> 43:36.280
Let me tell this part.

43:36.282 --> 43:38.382
Went down to those flowers.

43:38.384 --> 43:40.484
Her idea, right?

43:40.919 --> 43:42.786
Katy.

43:43.188 --> 43:45.623
So, what happened?

43:49.861 --> 43:52.329
Um...

43:52.331 --> 43:54.565
She, uh... she caught us.

43:54.567 --> 43:55.765
Who?

43:55.767 --> 43:57.001
She was one of the chaperones.

43:57.003 --> 43:59.403
Um, on the trip, it was...

43:59.405 --> 44:00.838
who?

44:00.840 --> 44:04.008
Well, she sat us down
together...

44:04.010 --> 44:08.245
And said that whatever happened
that night...

44:09.514 --> 44:12.416
Was never going to happen
again...

44:12.418 --> 44:15.185
Or I wouldn't be her son.

44:17.088 --> 44:20.658
Katy wouldn't even talk to me.

44:20.660 --> 44:23.093
She wouldn't even look at me...

44:23.095 --> 44:26.263
When she went down the halls.

44:28.700 --> 44:31.135
But, yeah, it went on like that
till graduation...

44:31.137 --> 44:34.605
And then I never saw her
again, so...

44:34.607 --> 44:36.273
well, geez, Pete.

44:36.275 --> 44:39.476
That's sadder than
a Bruce Springsteen song.

44:43.948 --> 44:45.349
Well...

44:45.351 --> 44:46.650
My mother was right.

44:46.652 --> 44:49.653
Making love is too important
to waste.

44:51.656 --> 44:53.190
Know something?

44:53.192 --> 44:56.326
I feel the exact same way.

44:57.395 --> 45:01.031
I think it's like a gift
two people give each other.

45:01.033 --> 45:03.067
Like Christmas presents.

45:03.970 --> 45:04.869
Come on.

45:04.870 --> 45:07.571
Pay up. I want to show
you something.

45:09.774 --> 45:11.709
Are you sure we should
be in here?

45:11.711 --> 45:13.677
Come on.

45:15.847 --> 45:17.147
Ta-da.

45:17.149 --> 45:20.417
That doesn't look, um...
probably shouldn't... okay.

45:20.419 --> 45:23.754
My ex-boss... she owns this
place.

45:23.756 --> 45:25.823
All she ever talks about is how
she lost her shirt...

45:25.825 --> 45:27.825
And the bank did this and that,
and now they gotta...

45:27.827 --> 45:30.060
Fight it out in court.

45:35.133 --> 45:37.901
Do you like it?

45:39.938 --> 45:41.672
Yeah.

45:43.041 --> 45:44.608
I'm gonna stay here tonight.

45:46.511 --> 45:49.413
You wanna spy on some people?

45:49.415 --> 45:50.781
Come on.

45:56.654 --> 45:59.256
Okay... come here.

45:59.258 --> 46:01.291
You see that people right there?

46:02.160 --> 46:04.094
Oh yeah. Yeah.

46:04.096 --> 46:06.029
You see the baby?

46:06.164 --> 46:07.698
Yeah.

46:07.700 --> 46:08.799
Okay, just go with it.

46:08.801 --> 46:11.201
On the count of three
you're gonna blow.

46:11.636 --> 46:13.637
One.

46:13.639 --> 46:15.405
Two.

46:15.407 --> 46:16.607
Three.

46:34.692 --> 46:36.960
I didn't mind...

46:39.063 --> 46:44.168
The way that you were looking
at me on the bus this morning.

46:44.869 --> 46:47.738
In fact, I liked it.

46:52.277 --> 46:54.945
Do you like me?

46:58.016 --> 46:59.683
Yeah.

47:10.929 --> 47:13.764
I have to get back.

47:16.067 --> 47:18.302
I'm sorry.

47:18.703 --> 47:21.004
All business, aren't you,
Mr. Pete?

47:23.775 --> 47:26.376
You could stay...

47:26.378 --> 47:30.013
Uh... with me...

47:30.015 --> 47:32.149
Tonight.

47:33.384 --> 47:34.718
But your mom...

47:34.720 --> 47:36.954
they're at Hilton head.

47:38.223 --> 47:40.724
Yeah?

47:46.965 --> 47:49.233
You really want me?

47:52.070 --> 47:54.238
All you have to do is say
that you want me...

47:54.240 --> 47:56.340
And I'll believe you.

47:56.342 --> 47:58.075
I want you.

48:01.412 --> 48:03.847
Now you listen to me.

48:03.849 --> 48:05.549
You can lie about
the little stuff...

48:05.551 --> 48:08.051
But not about what's important.

48:08.053 --> 48:11.154
And don't you be mean.

48:11.489 --> 48:14.892
I couldn't take it
if you were mean.

48:15.526 --> 48:17.261
I...

48:22.100 --> 48:23.867
I have to go.

48:23.869 --> 48:25.569
No.

48:26.271 --> 48:28.572
I'm sorry.

49:34.572 --> 49:38.075
Ray... I don't like that kid.

49:38.077 --> 49:40.277
He thinks he's better than us.

49:40.279 --> 49:43.080
Joe college, fucking smart ass.

49:43.082 --> 49:44.081
Us?

49:45.283 --> 49:46.583
Yeah.

49:46.585 --> 49:48.452
Oh, hey, Bobby!

49:49.620 --> 49:52.189
Do me a favor.
Get your gun out.

49:52.191 --> 49:53.657
Ray, come on.

49:53.659 --> 49:55.659
No, I'm serious. Get your gun
out and shoot me.

49:55.661 --> 49:56.994
I'll stand still,
it'll be quick.

49:56.996 --> 50:00.163
I'm only trying to talk to
you, for Christ's sakes.

50:00.165 --> 50:02.265
If there's a god in heaven
and he's merciful...

50:02.267 --> 50:03.800
You will shoot me.

50:03.802 --> 50:05.702
What's your fucking problem,
Ray?

50:06.037 --> 50:07.471
You, warden.

50:07.473 --> 50:09.639
You know who your friend is,
Ray?

50:09.641 --> 50:10.639
Me.

50:10.641 --> 50:12.843
And we got policies about
religious decorations...

50:12.845 --> 50:13.777
In this mall.

50:13.779 --> 50:16.213
It's against the constitution
or something.

50:16.215 --> 50:18.181
Not to mention the sight
of baby Jesus here...

50:18.183 --> 50:19.616
Offends every friggin' towel
head and sheeny...

50:19.618 --> 50:21.451
Walking in this joint.

50:21.453 --> 50:24.955
I forget things for you!

50:24.957 --> 50:26.990
And what do I get?

50:26.992 --> 50:29.326
Your rancor.

50:29.328 --> 50:32.195
And rancor is easy, Ray.

50:32.197 --> 50:34.297
Easy!

50:34.299 --> 50:36.500
Fucking coward.

50:38.603 --> 50:41.138
That was fun.

50:43.675 --> 50:46.543
My mother owned a '67 rancor.

50:51.082 --> 50:53.183
Uh... plesko.

50:54.652 --> 50:56.086
Plesko.

50:56.088 --> 50:58.355
With a "P".

51:03.961 --> 51:05.829
There you are.

51:05.831 --> 51:07.064
Check it out, well, will you?

51:07.066 --> 51:10.200
Just make sure everything's
up to snuff.

51:11.969 --> 51:14.671
They brought us their
memories, Pete.

51:14.673 --> 51:17.574
And we immortalize
them in silver...

51:17.576 --> 51:20.777
And gave it back for pennies
on the dollar.

51:21.612 --> 51:24.681
That will be 17 dollars
and 27 cents.

51:26.117 --> 51:29.953
Uh... yeah, we'll have
to come back.

51:29.955 --> 51:32.456
No, you won't come back.

51:32.458 --> 51:34.257
You won't come back...

51:34.259 --> 51:37.861
And I will have to look at those
pictures every day...

51:37.863 --> 51:40.764
Until I fucking puke.

51:40.766 --> 51:43.266
You won't come back...

51:43.268 --> 51:46.570
Because you never intended
to pay for them.

51:46.572 --> 51:51.141
You dropped them off here
to become permanent inventory...

51:51.143 --> 51:56.213
In the little part of hell
that I permanently oversee.

51:56.681 --> 51:59.649
And what did I do? Hm?

51:59.651 --> 52:01.952
I gave you the benefit
of the doubt.

52:01.954 --> 52:04.888
I let you look at them.

52:04.890 --> 52:08.425
Because I'm in the service
business.

52:08.427 --> 52:10.827
A concept that has long
since vanished...

52:10.829 --> 52:12.262
From the American retail scene.

52:12.264 --> 52:13.130
Am I right, Ray?

52:13.132 --> 52:15.799
Pinky, take it easy.

52:17.735 --> 52:19.636
So, listen to me...

52:19.638 --> 52:22.739
You fucking little wastrel.

52:22.741 --> 52:26.343
You will clear away
the cobwebs...

52:26.345 --> 52:28.478
From your rotting cerebrum...

52:28.480 --> 52:33.583
Long enough to pay me
the money that you owe.

52:33.585 --> 52:36.987
Or, so help me god,
I will fucking top you...

52:36.989 --> 52:39.122
And leave you for the
fucking dogs!

52:39.124 --> 52:41.291
No, pinky, stop!

52:41.293 --> 52:42.959
I don't want your fucking money!

52:42.961 --> 52:44.327
Go! Go!

52:44.329 --> 52:46.029
I want my check!

52:46.264 --> 52:51.434
Pearl river. Paramus.
White plains.

52:51.436 --> 52:54.471
He does that to us every year!

52:54.473 --> 52:56.540
He does it to humiliate us...

52:56.542 --> 52:59.976
To show us that we're nothing
but fucking plugs!

52:59.978 --> 53:01.478
Plugs, mate!

53:03.114 --> 53:04.781
Hey.

53:05.883 --> 53:08.385
Time for a little break.
What do you say, huh?

53:22.633 --> 53:24.401
Thank you.

53:24.403 --> 53:26.036
It was my husband's.

53:26.038 --> 53:28.705
You sold it to him a while ago.

53:28.707 --> 53:31.575
One moment, one moment.
Please, please.

53:33.978 --> 53:35.845
You're so kind.

53:35.847 --> 53:37.647
I'm honored.

53:41.018 --> 53:43.253
Uh, anyway, um...

53:43.255 --> 53:45.255
my husband said it was
worth a lot.

53:45.257 --> 53:47.390
And he was right.

53:47.392 --> 53:50.093
It <i> was</i> worth a lot.

53:50.095 --> 53:51.394
Once.

53:51.396 --> 53:53.863
But time moves on.

53:54.632 --> 53:57.400
You know what I wish sometimes?

53:57.402 --> 53:59.069
Sometimes I wish I could just...

53:59.071 --> 54:00.503
Take the world...

54:00.505 --> 54:06.443
This whole spinning orb, in my
hands and just make it stop...

54:06.445 --> 54:09.446
Just for a minute.

54:11.215 --> 54:13.950
But I can't.

54:14.685 --> 54:17.287
I can't.

54:17.622 --> 54:20.023
It's probably just as well.

54:20.025 --> 54:23.360
I mean, lord knows what would
happen to the weather.

54:23.362 --> 54:24.961
Now tell me...

54:24.963 --> 54:28.598
Why exactly did you want
the camera repaired?

54:30.368 --> 54:32.435
Your son did that?

54:33.704 --> 54:35.472
I'll tell you, Mr. Steuben...

54:35.474 --> 54:37.073
pinky.

54:37.075 --> 54:38.475
Pinky.

54:38.477 --> 54:41.611
A neighbor gave him this little
camera, and...

54:41.613 --> 54:44.381
He just ca... came to life.

54:53.391 --> 54:56.593
I would really like to get
to meet this young champion.

54:56.595 --> 54:57.727
Aw.

55:01.532 --> 55:02.432
No, no, no.

55:02.434 --> 55:04.301
I don't see Randall just
taking pictures.

55:04.303 --> 55:08.438
I see him making photographs.

55:08.440 --> 55:11.341
That, Brenda, is why I'm going
to recommend this model.

55:15.446 --> 55:17.447
Will that be cash?

55:20.117 --> 55:22.252
You have beautiful handwriting.

55:22.254 --> 55:24.020
For a beautiful lady.

55:24.022 --> 55:26.756
Excuse me, um... Mr. Steuben.

55:28.693 --> 55:30.660
Excuse me a second, Brenda.

55:30.662 --> 55:32.829
Back in a moment.

55:35.800 --> 55:37.100
What the fuck are you doing?

55:37.102 --> 55:39.936
I'm selling the lady a camera
for her son.

55:39.938 --> 55:41.471
It's Christmas, remember.

55:41.473 --> 55:43.206
It's going to be $3800 min.

55:43.208 --> 55:45.008
39.

55:46.977 --> 55:48.478
That'll put us over.

55:48.480 --> 55:49.713
Kill the sale.

55:49.715 --> 55:51.481
The fuck I will.
Shh!

55:54.385 --> 55:56.186
Kill it.

55:56.188 --> 55:58.521
This is not the number.

55:58.523 --> 55:59.889
The number?

55:59.891 --> 56:01.825
I don't give a damn about...

56:01.827 --> 56:03.326
you want to know about
the number?

56:03.328 --> 56:04.361
I'll tell you the number.

56:04.363 --> 56:07.530
It is half of one percent
of five thousand.

56:07.532 --> 56:08.698
That's the number.

56:08.700 --> 56:10.233
Now you let me go,
because she'll walk.

56:10.235 --> 56:11.835
No, pinky, just listen to me.

56:11.837 --> 56:14.738
She's going to bring it back
anyway, they always do.

56:14.740 --> 56:17.707
You see the prices, I mean it's
$1,800 fucking less at Yorktown.

56:17.709 --> 56:19.676
She don't want Yorktown!
Shh.

56:19.678 --> 56:22.512
She wants me.

56:23.347 --> 56:25.648
She likes my handwriting.

56:25.650 --> 56:29.219
No, no, no, no.

56:30.088 --> 56:32.422
You want a piece? I'll give you
a taste.

56:32.424 --> 56:33.356
Not hungry.

56:33.358 --> 56:34.491
Well, I am.

56:34.493 --> 56:36.226
I want to sell a camera today.

56:36.228 --> 56:38.027
Is there a problem, pinky?

56:38.029 --> 56:40.530
Should I come back later?

56:40.532 --> 56:41.931
No problem at all, Brenda.

56:41.933 --> 56:45.068
Just indulge us for a moment,
will you?

56:45.070 --> 56:46.536
Look, I tell you what.

56:46.538 --> 56:48.838
You take the commission.
You can have all the commission.

56:48.840 --> 56:49.739
All the commission.

56:49.741 --> 56:52.242
And, what's more, I will break
it down over two or three days.

56:52.244 --> 56:53.576
Listen to me. Just kill it,
alright?

56:53.578 --> 56:55.111
Sell her a few hundred bucks
of something.

56:55.113 --> 56:56.579
We have to make the number.

56:56.581 --> 56:58.782
Fuck the number. When did you
care about the number?

56:58.784 --> 57:01.050
Listen, please, Ray.

57:01.052 --> 57:03.953
Please let me sell a camera.

57:03.955 --> 57:05.054
No, no, no, no.

57:05.056 --> 57:06.689
I'm asking you.

57:06.691 --> 57:07.891
As a friend.

57:07.893 --> 57:09.959
Let me sell.

57:15.399 --> 57:17.233
Hey.

57:17.468 --> 57:19.202
I know it looks like a lot...

57:19.204 --> 57:21.304
And it's more than we meant
to spend, but...

57:21.306 --> 57:23.440
mm-hm.

57:23.442 --> 57:25.108
Pinky, um...

57:25.110 --> 57:28.912
um... Mr. Steuben says
it's what you need.

57:28.914 --> 57:31.948
Not just to take pictures but...

57:31.950 --> 57:35.385
To make photographs.
Oh, nice.

57:35.387 --> 57:37.720
So, this is the young champion,
is it?

57:37.722 --> 57:40.156
Nice to meet you.

57:43.394 --> 57:47.564
Nicely, nicely done, Randall.
Um...

57:51.803 --> 57:53.002
um...

57:57.908 --> 58:03.112
Ma'am, my manager has just given
me a little bit of news.

58:03.114 --> 58:05.915
I liked Brenda better.

58:05.917 --> 58:06.950
Then, "Ma'am."

58:06.952 --> 58:09.786
It's just... it's just
a formality, um...

58:10.822 --> 58:12.589
but, pinky, we...

58:12.591 --> 58:13.490
look...

58:13.492 --> 58:15.458
the good people at Yorktown
camera...

58:15.460 --> 58:20.964
Are doing this entire package
for $1,800 dollars less.

58:27.271 --> 58:28.638
You don't want my money?

58:28.640 --> 58:29.706
No, no, no...

58:29.708 --> 58:31.674
It's... it's, um...

58:31.676 --> 58:34.844
you see, even with our strict...

58:34.846 --> 58:38.348
Price matching policy...

58:38.350 --> 58:39.816
We simply, uh...

58:39.818 --> 58:42.552
well, we simply can't match
that.

58:42.554 --> 58:44.153
You understand.

58:44.155 --> 58:46.523
No, I don't.

58:48.292 --> 58:51.294
You said that...
forget what I said!

58:51.296 --> 58:53.563
Sometimes I just talk.

59:04.108 --> 59:06.342
Come on.

59:09.513 --> 59:11.481
We're going to take this
camera...

59:11.483 --> 59:14.684
And get it fixed by someone
else.

59:29.700 --> 59:31.067
Mr. Lapine?

59:31.069 --> 59:32.402
Customer.

59:32.404 --> 59:33.870
Sign says you do repairs?

59:33.872 --> 59:34.571
Yes.

59:34.573 --> 59:36.573
That include pro gear?
Yes.

59:36.575 --> 59:37.774
You use a good local tech?

59:37.776 --> 59:40.343
Ah, I'm afraid no such
animal exists.

59:40.345 --> 59:43.179
If I can't do it, then I send it
down to the Techs in Hackensack.

59:43.181 --> 59:44.781
What seems to be the problem?

59:47.885 --> 59:49.719
Can I give you a hand?
Hey!

59:56.794 --> 59:58.595
I gotta do this right.

59:58.597 --> 01:00:00.430
It's a f30 with a digital back.

01:00:00.432 --> 01:00:03.066
I'm hoping to rescue the images.
Four shots.

01:00:03.068 --> 01:00:05.134
Then we should probably be able
to retrieve them.

01:00:05.136 --> 01:00:07.036
I cycled in fresh batteries
the whole time...

01:00:07.038 --> 01:00:07.971
I was at Walter Reed.

01:00:07.973 --> 01:00:09.238
That should keep the chip hot,
right?

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.707
I would think so, yes.

01:00:10.709 --> 01:00:12.442
Yes, it should.

01:00:12.444 --> 01:00:14.377
Make sure the image files
don't get deleted...

01:00:14.379 --> 01:00:15.812
Because they're important.

01:00:15.814 --> 01:00:17.914
I do understand, yes.

01:00:17.916 --> 01:00:20.550
It's crazy, one minute...

01:00:20.552 --> 01:00:24.087
Okay, I'm in Sarajevo, okay,
in a un-safe zone...

01:00:24.089 --> 01:00:26.389
And he's mugging for me,
you know...

01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:28.424
Smiling for my camera.

01:00:28.426 --> 01:00:30.727
He's... he's a funny little kid,
and um...

01:00:30.729 --> 01:00:32.095
The next...

01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:36.432
The round goes off like
a snap in my ear.

01:00:36.434 --> 01:00:38.267
There's no blood, it just looks
like he's sleeping, you know...

01:00:38.269 --> 01:00:40.970
It's just a kid, you know,
it's just a kid.

01:00:40.972 --> 01:00:42.805
I'm sure it was painful.

01:00:42.807 --> 01:00:44.240
Uh... I'm sorry, man.

01:00:44.242 --> 01:00:47.143
I'm sorry, I, uh... I gotta
learn to shut up, you know.

01:00:47.145 --> 01:00:49.112
It's all right.
I gotta learn to shut up.

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:51.481
Can you... can you do the work?

01:00:51.483 --> 01:00:53.149
I'm sorry.

01:00:53.151 --> 01:00:54.851
Send it to the...
do the work please!

01:00:54.853 --> 01:00:56.319
Come on, do the work, please!

01:00:56.321 --> 01:00:59.288
Save the pictures, please!
Do your job!

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:28.284
So, I want to send
joyous holiday wishes...

01:01:28.286 --> 01:01:29.118
To you and yours...

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:33.489
From all of us here at
bibideaux photographic.

01:01:33.491 --> 01:01:34.791
Goodbye.

01:01:34.793 --> 01:01:37.193
God bless.

01:01:55.012 --> 01:01:57.580
Pete, give us a minute.

01:01:58.115 --> 01:01:59.816
Okay.

01:02:34.685 --> 01:02:38.121
Pinky, what is it with Ray?

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:42.792
The boy.

01:02:43.994 --> 01:02:48.698
Losing him... tore their
marriage apart.

01:02:51.635 --> 01:02:53.903
<i>Man show 'em who you really are.</i>

01:02:53.905 --> 01:02:56.472
<i>You get a new life.</i>

01:02:56.474 --> 01:02:58.307
<i>Fuck up...</i>

01:02:58.309 --> 01:03:01.377
<i>And you die in this joint, Ray.</i>

01:03:01.379 --> 01:03:04.781
We spoke earlier regarding
my reference from lion.

01:03:04.783 --> 01:03:06.582
<i>Receptionist
you do realize it's a holiday?</i>

01:03:06.584 --> 01:03:08.951
Of course, yes, I know.
I'm aware that it's a holiday.

01:03:08.953 --> 01:03:11.053
But this matter cannot wait
until Monday.

01:03:58.302 --> 01:04:00.336
You can imagine him.

01:04:00.338 --> 01:04:01.838
He was an asshole before.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:02.972
Can you think of what
it was like...

01:04:02.974 --> 01:04:04.640
To live with him afterwards?

01:04:04.642 --> 01:04:07.543
But if it was Ray's store,
then how did bibideaux take it?

01:04:07.545 --> 01:04:12.114
He did it the old fashioned way.
He stole it.

01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:17.553
Not that I blame Alma.

01:04:17.555 --> 01:04:20.556
You couldn't blame Alma.

01:04:22.593 --> 01:04:25.628
Alma was really special,
you know.

01:04:25.729 --> 01:04:28.130
So, Ray's wife left him?

01:04:28.132 --> 01:04:30.199
And then...

01:04:30.201 --> 01:04:31.868
And then remarried bibideaux?

01:04:34.071 --> 01:04:36.038
Holy shit.

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:09.038
Alma.

01:05:10.474 --> 01:05:12.441
Shouldn't you be in boca?

01:05:13.477 --> 01:05:14.844
I was.

01:05:14.846 --> 01:05:17.213
What happened, they run out
of ice?

01:05:17.848 --> 01:05:19.916
I quit.

01:05:19.918 --> 01:05:22.351
Three years ago.

01:05:25.389 --> 01:05:27.723
I'll just congratulate myself.

01:05:27.725 --> 01:05:29.458
Ah, no, I'm sorry.

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:32.528
Good, no, that's good,
I'm glad for you.

01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:33.596
Yeah.

01:05:33.598 --> 01:05:35.197
Thanks.

01:05:35.199 --> 01:05:37.466
I sure put you through
a lot of trouble.

01:05:37.468 --> 01:05:40.903
Nah... you know I don't
remember.

01:05:40.905 --> 01:05:42.805
It was a long time ago.

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:48.411
These days I'm lucky I remember
where I parked the car.

01:05:49.212 --> 01:05:51.781
I saw it in the lot.

01:05:55.185 --> 01:05:59.055
Ray! You kept it.

01:05:59.057 --> 01:06:02.458
Yeah, it's a fucking Christmas
heirloom, of course, I kept it.

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:03.592
Yeah.

01:06:03.594 --> 01:06:04.827
It looks like it.

01:06:04.829 --> 01:06:07.630
Watch what you say,
I cleaned that up myself.

01:06:15.939 --> 01:06:18.808
Do you remember that first
Christmas?

01:06:18.810 --> 01:06:22.078
We were in that little place
on catalpa circle?

01:06:22.245 --> 01:06:23.412
Not so much.

01:06:23.414 --> 01:06:24.480
Oh, come on, come on...

01:06:24.482 --> 01:06:27.917
You took the Christmas tree
and you planted it.

01:06:27.919 --> 01:06:29.852
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:29.854 --> 01:06:31.320
It grew like a weed, too.

01:06:31.322 --> 01:06:33.089
Well, you watered it night
and day.

01:06:33.091 --> 01:06:35.157
I froze my ass off.

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:38.527
It must be big now.

01:06:39.463 --> 01:06:41.330
Got cut down.

01:06:41.332 --> 01:06:42.999
No!
Yeah.

01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:44.500
The county.

01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:48.637
Progress, huh?

01:06:48.805 --> 01:06:52.375
What were you doing over in
that part of the neighborhood?

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:57.480
Um... I should, uh...
good to see you though, really.

01:06:57.482 --> 01:06:59.015
Enjoy your shopping.

01:06:59.017 --> 01:07:00.516
Ray.

01:07:00.518 --> 01:07:02.218
I didn't...

01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:05.221
I didn't come here to shop.

01:07:05.223 --> 01:07:07.356
I came to see you.

01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:10.326
What for?

01:07:10.328 --> 01:07:12.028
The camera store, he's...

01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:13.062
oh, listen.

01:07:13.064 --> 01:07:14.030
Goddammit.

01:07:14.032 --> 01:07:14.997
You know what?

01:07:14.999 --> 01:07:16.966
Tell your husband, if he's got
a problem...

01:07:16.968 --> 01:07:19.402
With the way that I run things
here, just have him come down...

01:07:19.404 --> 01:07:22.138
Face me man to man,
not send his wife.

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:24.373
I got an important phone call
to make, all right?

01:07:24.375 --> 01:07:25.574
Ray, please, just...

01:07:25.576 --> 01:07:27.209
just listen to me for a minute.

01:07:27.211 --> 01:07:29.178
Oh, fuck!

01:07:31.181 --> 01:07:34.216
It stopped! This old fucking
watch stopped!

01:07:35.152 --> 01:07:37.720
I'm standing here bullshitting
with you.

01:07:37.722 --> 01:07:39.021
It wasn't bullshit.

01:07:39.023 --> 01:07:41.090
It's closed now, nakimura
is gone, I'm...

01:07:42.259 --> 01:07:43.926
Alma, tell me... please tell
me...

01:07:43.928 --> 01:07:45.761
What... what are you doing here?

01:07:45.763 --> 01:07:47.029
Did your husband send you, what?

01:07:47.031 --> 01:07:49.432
To, I don't know, soften me
up so don't get pissed off...

01:07:49.434 --> 01:07:52.234
When he stuck me with another
shit bonus?

01:07:52.236 --> 01:07:53.569
Is that what... I mean,
my entire day.

01:07:53.571 --> 01:07:56.105
At open, I get the ghost
of Christmas present.

01:07:56.107 --> 01:07:58.374
And now, at closing, the ghost
of Christmas past...

01:07:58.376 --> 01:07:59.775
Comes floating in.

01:07:59.777 --> 01:08:01.077
Who showed up at open?

01:08:01.079 --> 01:08:03.379
Ah, fuckin', Karly.

01:08:03.381 --> 01:08:04.380
Reagan?

01:08:04.382 --> 01:08:06.582
Yeah, Karly Reagan, he was...

01:08:06.584 --> 01:08:08.451
Asking advice, talking about
the future.

01:08:08.453 --> 01:08:12.788
Was this long blue streak
of salesman bullshit...

01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:15.257
As opaque and vague
as your bullshit.

01:08:15.259 --> 01:08:17.093
It wasn't bullshit.

01:08:17.095 --> 01:08:19.228
Please, just tell me you're
not part of this, huh?

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:21.029
Oh, I'm not even going to answer
that question.

01:08:21.032 --> 01:08:22.731
Do me a favor, answer me this...

01:08:22.733 --> 01:08:25.701
How can you be with that
miserable fuck?

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:32.108
Because he's not you.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.112
Pull.

01:08:39.015 --> 01:08:40.416
Ray!

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:42.718
Ray, come on, you gotta
see this.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.453
Ray, would you just...

01:08:44.455 --> 01:08:47.656
Would you just once,
listen to me?

01:08:47.658 --> 01:08:49.125
Ray?

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:53.996
What the fuck, man?

01:08:53.997 --> 01:08:57.133
Nakimura and your husband?

01:08:57.135 --> 01:08:58.801
They knew this was my
fucking idea!

01:08:58.803 --> 01:09:00.336
Ray, I didn't know,
I came to tell you.

01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:03.805
What, that your husband's
a colluding prick?

01:09:03.808 --> 01:09:06.509
And where were you all
this time? Boca?

01:09:06.511 --> 01:09:07.643
Oh, that's not fair.

01:09:07.645 --> 01:09:08.844
Oh, and this is?

01:09:08.845 --> 01:09:10.513
Ray, come on, take it easy.

01:09:10.515 --> 01:09:13.948
You spineless invertebrate,
you knew about this?

01:09:13.951 --> 01:09:15.350
You knew this was my idea.

01:09:15.353 --> 01:09:17.319
How many fucking times have
I talked about this?

01:09:17.321 --> 01:09:18.754
How many fucking times?

01:09:18.756 --> 01:09:20.022
Mr. B. Doesn't tell me anything.

01:09:20.024 --> 01:09:22.191
I swear to god, I had no idea
you were serious.

01:09:22.193 --> 01:09:23.091
Serious? Okay.

01:09:23.094 --> 01:09:24.960
Wanna talk serious?

01:09:24.962 --> 01:09:27.196
You talk to nakimura, you want
to hear serious, huh?

01:09:27.198 --> 01:09:29.665
Pinky! Pinky, you gotta
get out here!

01:09:29.667 --> 01:09:31.634
I was one signature away.

01:09:31.636 --> 01:09:34.036
One kind word spoken about me
and I'm in.

01:09:34.037 --> 01:09:35.970
You amateur cunt!

01:09:35.973 --> 01:09:36.971
You let this happen!

01:09:36.974 --> 01:09:38.541
I didn't let nothing happen!

01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:40.475
You said it yourself, Ray,
I don't run this mall.

01:09:40.478 --> 01:09:41.310
B does!

01:09:41.312 --> 01:09:42.011
This is his work.

01:09:42.013 --> 01:09:43.779
Fuck you, you're the warden
here.

01:09:43.781 --> 01:09:46.282
No! You know who your jailer
is, Ray?

01:09:46.283 --> 01:09:47.783
Not me.

01:09:47.785 --> 01:09:50.286
Do I keep you here?
Do I hold the keys?

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:52.287
Do I lock you in every night?

01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:53.721
I try to talk to you.

01:09:53.724 --> 01:09:56.859
I try to work with you to
make the time go easier.

01:09:56.861 --> 01:09:58.894
And you got no cause to come
in everyday...

01:09:58.896 --> 01:10:01.030
And demean me like I was
nothing. I ain't nothing!

01:10:01.032 --> 01:10:04.066
I didn't make you
take this job, junior.

01:10:04.668 --> 01:10:06.135
Do you ever think
about anybody else...

01:10:06.137 --> 01:10:08.237
But your miserable
fucking self, Ray?

01:10:08.239 --> 01:10:11.540
You ever think maybe
I want more? A future?

01:10:11.542 --> 01:10:14.143
It ever occur to you that this
ain't the job that I want...

01:10:14.145 --> 01:10:15.043
But the job I got?

01:10:15.045 --> 01:10:16.879
You want a fucking job?
You want another fucking job?

01:10:16.881 --> 01:10:18.581
How about peeing your pants?
How about hate?

01:10:18.583 --> 01:10:20.716
Ray.

01:10:20.718 --> 01:10:22.885
Pinky, what the fuck?

01:10:25.255 --> 01:10:27.856
Come on, it's over.
It's okay, Ray.

01:10:27.858 --> 01:10:30.192
No, it's not.

01:10:34.631 --> 01:10:37.199
It's all right, mate.
Alma.

01:10:37.201 --> 01:10:39.401
No, she's not here, mate.
She was.

01:10:39.403 --> 01:10:42.037
Yeah, of course, she was.
No, I heard the music.

01:10:42.039 --> 01:10:43.672
She tried to warn me.

01:10:43.674 --> 01:10:45.741
Of course, she did, mate.
Of course, she did.

01:10:45.743 --> 01:10:47.876
It's all right.
She's a good girl.

01:10:47.878 --> 01:10:50.879
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

01:10:50.881 --> 01:10:53.682
You want a stool?

01:10:53.684 --> 01:10:55.718
Oh, bugger me!

01:10:58.521 --> 01:11:03.025
Blimey, the uh... the
snowbird's returned early, eh?

01:11:03.027 --> 01:11:08.464
Pinky, the store was empty.

01:11:08.466 --> 01:11:09.964
If I was a nigger...

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:12.134
I'd have half the
inventory in my truck by now.

01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:14.637
Sorry.

01:11:14.639 --> 01:11:16.405
Lost our heads in the
excitement.

01:11:16.407 --> 01:11:18.941
Put on quite a show for
those Christmas shoppers, huh?

01:11:18.943 --> 01:11:20.542
That's one no one's
gonna forget.

01:11:20.544 --> 01:11:23.145
Yeah, well, it's that big
new machine downstairs.

01:11:23.147 --> 01:11:24.113
It's very impressive.

01:11:24.115 --> 01:11:27.283
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it's a real gold mine.

01:11:27.285 --> 01:11:30.719
You're gonna need big bags
to drag all that money away.

01:11:32.989 --> 01:11:36.458
Well, it's good to see you.
Um, um...

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:40.796
did you bring some sunshine
with you?

01:11:40.798 --> 01:11:42.264
Business?

01:11:42.266 --> 01:11:45.134
Oh, yeah. Picking up.
Picking up.

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:51.407
I had a four grand SLR
about to go out the door today.

01:11:51.409 --> 01:11:53.842
Of course, we had
to kill the sale.

01:11:53.844 --> 01:11:55.811
Aw, don't sell cameras, pinky.

01:11:55.813 --> 01:11:59.948
Sell the little junk, right?
Huh?

01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:01.750
Pure markup.

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:05.688
So, gonna hit the number?
Hm?

01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:07.856
Well, that is our goal, sir.

01:12:07.858 --> 01:12:09.191
Well, shouldn't be too tough.

01:12:09.193 --> 01:12:13.495
After all, it's Christmas Eve
day, you know, you would think.

01:12:13.497 --> 01:12:15.264
You would think.

01:12:15.266 --> 01:12:18.000
That store by Yorktown, they
got 'em out the door.

01:12:21.271 --> 01:12:22.838
Hey, Ray.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.009
How much you steal from me, Ray?

01:12:28.144 --> 01:12:29.345
Steal.

01:12:29.347 --> 01:12:32.881
Yeah, that's right.
How much?

01:12:32.883 --> 01:12:35.050
Nothing.

01:12:35.052 --> 01:12:37.186
Oh, come, Ray, nothing?

01:12:37.188 --> 01:12:39.488
You don't take a roll
of film home?

01:12:39.490 --> 01:12:42.458
No.
A frame?

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:43.525
No.

01:12:43.527 --> 01:12:45.327
You don't work a
little barter deal...

01:12:45.329 --> 01:12:46.195
With some of the other vendors?

01:12:46.197 --> 01:12:47.529
No.

01:12:47.531 --> 01:12:49.198
Short the register a little bit?

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.466
Never.

01:12:50.468 --> 01:12:54.670
In 23 years, not even a
battery, for Christ's sake?

01:12:54.672 --> 01:12:58.574
24. But no, nothing.

01:12:58.576 --> 01:13:00.476
Why not?

01:13:00.478 --> 01:13:04.847
Because it's my store, Eddie.
Why would I steal from myself?

01:13:04.849 --> 01:13:06.648
Your store.

01:13:06.650 --> 01:13:09.184
What makes you ask?

01:13:09.186 --> 01:13:14.323
Oh, nothing, curiosity,
that's all.

01:13:14.325 --> 01:13:16.525
Just curious.

01:13:19.262 --> 01:13:21.597
I want 15 percent of that
machine.

01:13:23.133 --> 01:13:25.100
You mean my machine?
My deal?

01:13:25.102 --> 01:13:28.437
The one you put little
Karly up to fuck me.

01:13:28.439 --> 01:13:30.339
Guess who got fucked?

01:13:30.341 --> 01:13:32.508
Karly, Ray.

01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:34.109
Your old accomplice.

01:13:34.111 --> 01:13:36.278
Punk cocksucker.

01:13:37.847 --> 01:13:40.182
Got walked out in front
of the whole company...

01:13:40.184 --> 01:13:43.519
By two Pinkertons, holding his
copy of a non-compete contract.

01:13:43.521 --> 01:13:47.256
As far as any aspect of this
business goes...

01:13:47.258 --> 01:13:51.360
Karly fucking Reagan is dead
and buried. Hm?

01:13:54.864 --> 01:14:00.569
Which leaves you and me.

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:04.473
Are you negotiating with me,
Ray?

01:14:04.808 --> 01:14:07.776
That machine was my idea
and you know it.

01:14:07.778 --> 01:14:09.711
Oh, come on, my idea.

01:14:09.713 --> 01:14:12.080
An idea is one thing,
but actually doing it, Ray...

01:14:12.082 --> 01:14:13.549
That's what matters.

01:14:13.551 --> 01:14:17.486
Why should I pay you anything?

01:14:17.488 --> 01:14:20.556
He's got a point, mate.
Shut up, pinky.

01:14:20.558 --> 01:14:22.991
You should pay me,
because it's right.

01:14:22.993 --> 01:14:27.062
It's right.
Is it right, right?

01:14:27.064 --> 01:14:30.766
But is it right to steal
from a man?

01:14:30.768 --> 01:14:33.068
I don't fucking steal.

01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:35.337
Ten percent. I'll run it.

01:14:35.339 --> 01:14:37.806
Oh, come on, Ray.
You know it's automatic.

01:14:37.808 --> 01:14:40.776
A monkey could run it.
I'll pay a kid minimum.

01:14:40.778 --> 01:14:43.078
Besides, it's better to
have someone young...

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.248
Who understands these
newfangled gadgets.

01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:48.517
Okay, Ray, just sit tight here.

01:14:48.519 --> 01:14:50.619
You sell the little crap,
like always.

01:14:51.888 --> 01:14:53.956
Forget about the machine.

01:14:53.958 --> 01:14:56.258
No.

01:14:58.061 --> 01:15:01.630
Did you say something, Ray?
Hm?

01:15:02.932 --> 01:15:05.801
Because if you're questioning
my leadership...

01:15:05.803 --> 01:15:08.136
If you want to go work
somewhere else...

01:15:08.138 --> 01:15:10.205
Let me be the first to say...

01:15:10.207 --> 01:15:13.475
It's cheaper to fire you
than retire you.

01:15:13.477 --> 01:15:17.012
Huh, is that it?

01:15:18.648 --> 01:15:20.115
Itching to go out on your own,
Ray?

01:15:20.117 --> 01:15:21.517
Test yourself?

01:15:21.519 --> 01:15:23.485
'Cause there's a whole wide
world out there just waiting...

01:15:23.487 --> 01:15:28.824
For a man of your age and skill
level to burst upon the scene.

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:33.495
So either you want to hike
the fuck out of here tonight...

01:15:33.497 --> 01:15:35.898
Or I think you owe me
an apology.

01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:41.336
I'll do it, Ray.
I apologize.

01:15:41.338 --> 01:15:43.572
Peter, how's everyone
treating you?

01:15:43.574 --> 01:15:45.574
Great.
You learning a lot?

01:15:45.576 --> 01:15:48.343
That's good. I want you to tell
your mom and dad I said hi.

01:15:48.345 --> 01:15:49.845
Okay?
Okay.

01:15:53.349 --> 01:15:55.551
Bon Italia.

01:15:58.655 --> 01:16:01.156
Uh, Mr. B., the Christmas
checks... w-when...

01:16:01.158 --> 01:16:03.659
down tonight, like always.

01:16:05.862 --> 01:16:08.664
Are you all right?
Yeah.

01:16:19.976 --> 01:16:22.044
<i>Woman
attention holiday shoppers.</i>

01:16:22.046 --> 01:16:25.113
<i>We thank you for
another wonderful year.</i>

01:16:25.115 --> 01:16:27.749
<i>And look forward to
the next and many more.</i>

01:16:27.751 --> 01:16:31.019
<i>To you and yours, from all
of us, merry Christmas.</i>

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:45.067
Merry Christmas, one and all!

01:16:51.975 --> 01:16:53.909
Movie film.

01:17:05.488 --> 01:17:07.422
What's that?
$25,000.

01:17:07.424 --> 01:17:08.957
Wow.

01:17:10.593 --> 01:17:12.494
Um, I don't understand.

01:17:12.496 --> 01:17:14.596
Three weeks back,
I sold out to Nunzio.

01:17:14.598 --> 01:17:16.965
He takes over on Monday.

01:17:16.967 --> 01:17:19.334
You... Monday.

01:17:19.336 --> 01:17:21.103
Mm-hm.

01:17:21.105 --> 01:17:23.805
But you're still gonna
come around, right?

01:17:23.807 --> 01:17:25.007
Help him out?

01:17:25.009 --> 01:17:27.109
Nunzy doesn't need my help.

01:17:27.111 --> 01:17:29.611
I did my bit, Ray.
I'm free.

01:17:29.613 --> 01:17:33.815
Of my store, this place,
my debts, everything.

01:17:33.817 --> 01:17:36.752
And I want that for you.

01:17:36.754 --> 01:17:39.254
I want you to walk out of here.

01:17:39.256 --> 01:17:41.690
Forget bibideaux, you're better
than that guy.

01:17:41.692 --> 01:17:46.795
Hold your head up and be your
best and make some real money.

01:17:47.797 --> 01:17:50.132
Get free, Ray.

01:17:50.134 --> 01:17:52.668
So you want...

01:17:53.703 --> 01:17:55.504
you want to invest.
Yeah.

01:17:55.506 --> 01:17:57.706
In the one-hour photo booth,
and you.

01:17:57.708 --> 01:17:59.641
Me?
Yeah.

01:17:59.643 --> 01:18:01.710
It took you five years
to convince me...

01:18:01.712 --> 01:18:03.679
But you got me hook
line and sinker.

01:18:03.681 --> 01:18:04.980
I want in.

01:18:05.648 --> 01:18:07.282
You want in.

01:18:07.284 --> 01:18:08.984
I always have.

01:18:08.986 --> 01:18:11.053
Why are you doing this?

01:18:11.055 --> 01:18:14.289
24 years, I work across
from you.

01:18:14.291 --> 01:18:16.191
Back in the day,
I would watch you.

01:18:16.193 --> 01:18:18.226
You could sell
anything to anybody.

01:18:18.228 --> 01:18:21.496
Because you don't sell.

01:18:21.498 --> 01:18:24.366
You give people the
permission...

01:18:24.368 --> 01:18:27.502
The confidence to buy what
they came in already wanting.

01:18:27.504 --> 01:18:29.571
And I think you
want to do that again.

01:18:29.573 --> 01:18:31.807
And I want to back you.

01:18:31.809 --> 01:18:32.974
Don't think of it as a loan.

01:18:32.976 --> 01:18:37.145
Think of it as just a leg up,
you know, a start.

01:18:38.681 --> 01:18:40.015
I'm not a charity.

01:18:40.017 --> 01:18:41.216
Charity.

01:18:41.218 --> 01:18:43.885
Oh, all right, fine,
it's a loan. Business.

01:18:43.887 --> 01:18:46.221
Whatever you want to call it,
Ray. Take the money.

01:18:46.223 --> 01:18:49.591
Oh, well, so business now.
You have terms?

01:18:49.593 --> 01:18:53.528
Yeah, I got terms.
Pay me back before you die.

01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:55.897
It's very difficult
to get so involved...

01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:57.265
With something vague like that.

01:18:57.267 --> 01:18:59.167
Take the money, Ray.

01:18:59.169 --> 01:19:01.703
I feel like I wouldn't be
my own boss now. It's not...

01:19:01.705 --> 01:19:03.605
take the money, Ray.

01:19:06.042 --> 01:19:07.342
Fucking bibideaux fucked it all
up...

01:19:07.344 --> 01:19:11.113
And he came all the way back
from Florida just to fuck me.

01:19:11.115 --> 01:19:13.715
No, Ray.
What do you know?

01:19:13.717 --> 01:19:15.250
He did. He fucked me.

01:19:15.252 --> 01:19:17.385
Bibideaux didn't fuck anything.

01:19:17.387 --> 01:19:21.757
You can't get turned down for a
loan that you never applied for.

01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:28.396
You heard the way he talked
to me, right?

01:19:28.398 --> 01:19:30.966
Fuck.

01:19:30.968 --> 01:19:35.103
What did he steal from me?
What... what does he owe me?

01:19:35.105 --> 01:19:38.907
Cocks, I'm telling
you I can't... ah fuck.

01:19:38.909 --> 01:19:41.076
I can't even
finish my own sentence.

01:19:41.078 --> 01:19:44.746
I-I I can't.

01:20:05.201 --> 01:20:06.668
Take the money, Mr. Lapine.

01:20:06.670 --> 01:20:08.069
Are you addressing me?

01:20:08.071 --> 01:20:09.838
I'll tell you what,
please don't.

01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:14.009
Just take the money.
Just please.

01:20:14.011 --> 01:20:17.112
Hey! What about me?
Huh? My sentence?

01:20:17.114 --> 01:20:19.414
Do I get to finish
what I'm saying?

01:20:19.416 --> 01:20:20.949
I'll tell you what, you know,
you look a little stressed...

01:20:20.951 --> 01:20:22.083
Why don't you go ahead home?

01:20:22.085 --> 01:20:23.118
I'll make sure that
your check...

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.786
Gets to you in the evening.
No, no, I'm not.

01:20:24.788 --> 01:20:27.289
I'm not leaving.
Just go and scoot, scoot.

01:20:27.291 --> 01:20:30.659
Okay, look, all day I have to
shut up and listen to you.

01:20:30.661 --> 01:20:31.827
So now you listen to me...

01:20:31.829 --> 01:20:35.497
Because I'm trying to
help you make sense.

01:20:35.499 --> 01:20:37.265
Take the loan, Mr. Lapine.

01:20:38.868 --> 01:20:41.203
And don't ever apologize
to Mr. Bibideaux.

01:20:41.205 --> 01:20:45.006
Well, anyone...
For stealing your idea.

01:20:45.008 --> 01:20:47.843
Oh, you're trying to teach me
something about business now.

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:52.447
Something bigger.

01:20:57.753 --> 01:20:59.788
You know what? That reminds me.

01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:03.892
You still owe me
for Polaroid film.

01:21:03.894 --> 01:21:06.194
A triple, right?
Remember? Two boxes.

01:21:06.196 --> 01:21:09.464
And you know what? Here.

01:21:09.466 --> 01:21:12.534
Film's no good without a camera.
Go ahead, take it all.

01:21:12.536 --> 01:21:13.902
I haven't paid for the film.

01:21:13.904 --> 01:21:16.137
Yeah, well, you've got
credit here.

01:21:16.139 --> 01:21:17.672
See, with this,
it's really simple.

01:21:17.674 --> 01:21:20.141
Just fold it like that.
Folds flat.

01:21:20.143 --> 01:21:21.676
Put it in your pocket,
take it home.

01:21:21.678 --> 01:21:24.212
Anybody ask you, tell
them to talk to Ray Lapine...

01:21:24.214 --> 01:21:26.882
Because this is my store.

01:21:27.683 --> 01:21:31.553
Excuse me, Mr. Lapine.
Pete? Talk to you for a minute?

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:39.527
Remember that guy I
said I knew down here?

01:21:39.529 --> 01:21:43.064
Well, Dave, that's the guy.

01:21:43.066 --> 01:21:45.267
I called him and I told him
that I had plans tonight and...

01:21:45.269 --> 01:21:47.102
Everything and that we should
get together another time.

01:21:47.104 --> 01:21:49.838
But he...

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.940
well, it's a long story...

01:21:51.942 --> 01:21:57.445
But he just wants to meet for
one drink for Auld Lang Syne.

01:21:57.447 --> 01:22:02.250
So I said he could meet me here.
Is that okay?

01:22:02.252 --> 01:22:05.453
I'll see you on the bus?

01:22:05.455 --> 01:22:07.022
Okay.

01:22:10.493 --> 01:22:13.929
He's sick, Pete, honest.

01:22:49.765 --> 01:22:52.400
Do you still have
Dr. Lobell's photos?

01:22:53.936 --> 01:22:55.337
Yeah.

01:22:55.339 --> 01:22:57.806
Can I see them?

01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:02.243
You know... I guess.

01:23:27.903 --> 01:23:30.205
Oh, wow.

01:23:33.275 --> 01:23:36.444
That's your girl
with Dr. Lobell.

01:23:36.446 --> 01:23:39.114
That make her too low class
for you?

01:23:39.116 --> 01:23:41.483
That she's been with another
guy?

01:23:41.485 --> 01:23:44.285
No... well, maybe. Yeah.

01:23:45.654 --> 01:23:48.023
See, the problem with this
sort of thing, though is...

01:23:48.025 --> 01:23:51.960
Is you gotta figure,
does she get you?

01:23:53.329 --> 01:23:56.698
Possible that she could give you
something, like real?

01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.999
A quandary.

01:23:58.001 --> 01:24:00.001
That is a quandary, that
I will agree...

01:24:00.003 --> 01:24:02.637
But the choice you have
to make, isn't it?

01:24:02.639 --> 01:24:04.339
My mother would never...
yeah, you know what?

01:24:04.341 --> 01:24:07.809
Please forgive me,
but fuck your mother.

01:24:07.811 --> 01:24:09.411
I'm serious...

01:24:09.413 --> 01:24:11.379
And fuck Wharton while
you're at it, would you?

01:24:11.381 --> 01:24:13.348
Bring two condoms to the party.
I mean, come on.

01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:14.983
Fucking ten years from now...

01:24:14.985 --> 01:24:17.652
You'll be crushed under some
bullshit corporate crap.

01:24:17.654 --> 01:24:19.821
You might as well stay here
and die with pinky and me.

01:24:19.823 --> 01:24:22.690
You're young. You're...

01:24:22.692 --> 01:24:24.726
you should be out there
driving fucking cars.

01:24:24.728 --> 01:24:27.429
You know that gasoline
and perfume are the best

01:24:27.431 --> 01:24:29.364
aphrodisiacs on the fucking
planet.

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:33.568
Have a good time with a good
girl.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.240
Take out the garbage.
I gotta call the valley.

01:24:39.242 --> 01:24:40.675
Try to get our checks in.

01:24:48.585 --> 01:24:49.951
Good night.

01:25:12.575 --> 01:25:18.446
Yeah, yeah, $3,867
dollars and 86 cents.

01:25:18.448 --> 01:25:21.316
Checks on the way?

01:25:21.318 --> 01:25:24.486
Yes, of course, pinky's here.

01:25:25.888 --> 01:25:29.324
Yeah, fine, we'll wait.
Right. Same to you.

01:25:30.726 --> 01:25:33.061
You know we could have.

01:25:33.063 --> 01:25:35.063
Next year, huh?

01:25:35.065 --> 01:25:36.998
Hey, fuckheads.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.568
Couldn't even make five lousy
grand, you pussy-assed losers.

01:25:40.570 --> 01:25:44.105
I'll tell you what, you
palsy-old piece of shit.

01:25:44.107 --> 01:25:46.808
You come in here and I'll
shove that oxygen bottle...

01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:48.510
Right up your jackseat.

01:25:50.412 --> 01:25:52.647
Locked in, you fucking
greasy chimp.

01:25:52.649 --> 01:25:55.783
Open this fucking gate
right now!

01:25:55.785 --> 01:25:56.684
Them the checks?

01:26:00.623 --> 01:26:03.358
Give me the fucking envelope.
Unlock the gate.

01:26:16.805 --> 01:26:18.339
Get in.

01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:24.479
What the fuck is going on, Ray?

01:26:24.481 --> 01:26:26.314
We're closing.

01:26:27.483 --> 01:26:32.287
Thank god for that, mate.
I'm bloody exhausted.

01:26:32.289 --> 01:26:33.988
For good.

01:26:35.925 --> 01:26:38.193
I'm sorry, Ray. I didn't
hear that proper.

01:26:40.930 --> 01:26:43.531
Bibby's closing down the store.

01:26:44.567 --> 01:26:46.968
Cashed out the retirement plan.

01:26:47.970 --> 01:26:49.704
Your end.

01:26:51.006 --> 01:26:55.009
Well, he can't close the store.
It's not his to close.

01:27:01.417 --> 01:27:03.318
Ray, call the valley, will you?

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.520
There's been a
grievous error here.

01:27:10.259 --> 01:27:11.693
Pete, how much?

01:27:11.695 --> 01:27:17.198
227 dollars... and 69 cents.

01:27:18.767 --> 01:27:21.536
This is some sort
of debit history.

01:27:21.538 --> 01:27:23.671
Did you take out loans?

01:27:23.673 --> 01:27:25.039
It's a grievous error.

01:27:25.041 --> 01:27:27.575
Did you borrow
against your retirement?

01:27:27.577 --> 01:27:30.578
I don't want a retirement.
You see, no, no.

01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.414
I'm not retiring.
I can't retire.

01:27:33.416 --> 01:27:36.284
I've got a shelf load
of inventory I've got to unload.

01:27:36.286 --> 01:27:39.053
And... and who's going to
handle the returns next week?

01:27:39.055 --> 01:27:41.923
I mean, come on. Let's... let's
cut the bullshit here.

01:27:41.925 --> 01:27:43.224
They need us, Ray!

01:27:43.226 --> 01:27:46.361
You, to handle the returns
and me to do the selling!

01:27:46.729 --> 01:27:48.863
No.

01:27:58.307 --> 01:27:59.907
Oh, fuck.

01:28:08.684 --> 01:28:13.087
We're not businessmen.
We're not salesmen.

01:28:14.256 --> 01:28:19.227
We're not even fucking men.
We're a race of fucking rabbits.

01:28:19.229 --> 01:28:21.329
It's time to close, pinky.

01:28:23.499 --> 01:28:27.669
But Ray, you had the vision.
You had the smarts.

01:28:27.671 --> 01:28:30.305
You could calculate any number
in your head...

01:28:30.307 --> 01:28:32.640
And you could have taken
me with you.

01:28:32.642 --> 01:28:33.808
I would have followed you.

01:28:33.810 --> 01:28:35.777
And Alma would have followed
you.

01:28:35.779 --> 01:28:39.814
And we'd all be together,
and I would have made you rich.

01:28:39.816 --> 01:28:41.449
Fuck, it's immaterial.

01:28:41.451 --> 01:28:43.117
Immaterial?

01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:48.022
It's my life, Ray.

01:28:48.024 --> 01:28:51.659
You know what, my old friend? I
should have fired you years ago.

01:28:51.661 --> 01:28:54.495
I'm sorry that I didn't.

01:28:54.497 --> 01:28:58.933
Well, if that's some sort of
apology, I don't need it, mate.

01:28:58.935 --> 01:29:01.869
I know what I am.

01:29:01.871 --> 01:29:05.340
I am an utter fuck up.

01:29:07.076 --> 01:29:09.677
But why did you surrender?

01:29:13.649 --> 01:29:17.118
You know that every
photograph has two sides, right?

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:22.623
The positive, and the negative.

01:29:27.763 --> 01:29:29.464
You see that?

01:29:29.466 --> 01:29:31.833
See that guy?

01:29:31.835 --> 01:29:35.903
Remember him, 25 years ago?
Me? Huh?

01:29:35.905 --> 01:29:39.841
I mean, not a bad looking guy.

01:29:39.843 --> 01:29:41.709
Pictures don't lie about
that sort of thing, right?

01:29:41.711 --> 01:29:45.046
This guy, me, he was real.
He was real.

01:29:45.048 --> 01:29:47.315
He was a salesman.
He was a businessman.

01:29:49.151 --> 01:29:50.718
A man.

01:29:56.859 --> 01:29:59.594
And then I lost... him.

01:30:01.096 --> 01:30:04.365
And... her.

01:30:04.367 --> 01:30:09.504
And what is left, but
the fucking negative?

01:30:09.506 --> 01:30:12.340
Pinky, I don't even fucking
know who I am, all right?

01:30:12.342 --> 01:30:16.277
That... I don't know anything.
Any more.

01:30:16.279 --> 01:30:19.113
No, fuck that! You know, I do
know one thing, huh?

01:30:19.115 --> 01:30:21.883
We're fucking closing!

01:31:02.024 --> 01:31:04.892
So you'll be okay?
With your check?

01:31:04.894 --> 01:31:07.595
It could probably finance a couple
of those one-hour processors...

01:31:07.597 --> 01:31:08.996
no check.

01:31:12.267 --> 01:31:13.835
But I saw your envelope.

01:31:13.837 --> 01:31:15.403
Yes, but you didn't see
inside the envelope.

01:31:15.405 --> 01:31:17.772
There was no check.
There was a court order, though.

01:31:17.774 --> 01:31:20.408
It seems like all my
funds have been frozen.

01:31:20.410 --> 01:31:21.909
Well, they can't freeze it,
unless they're pressing...

01:31:21.911 --> 01:31:25.012
Criminal charges, they...
hmm.

01:31:29.051 --> 01:31:31.786
I'm... I'm sure you
can get that cleared.

01:31:31.788 --> 01:31:35.823
But your check... there was no
check in the envelope for you.

01:31:35.825 --> 01:31:39.660
Now usually, Christmas staff
is always paid...

01:31:39.662 --> 01:31:41.496
At the end of the shift.

01:31:41.498 --> 01:31:44.599
Unless, of course,
their work isn't done.

01:31:52.941 --> 01:31:54.876
Ah, he sent you to shop me.

01:31:54.878 --> 01:31:56.777
See if I was stealing
or cooking the books.

01:31:56.779 --> 01:31:59.180
You see anything?
You see me take anything?

01:31:59.182 --> 01:32:03.618
Um, film... a brand new camera.

01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:06.654
You gave me everything.

01:32:06.656 --> 01:32:10.858
Oh, right. Good business
lesson there.

01:32:15.931 --> 01:32:18.666
And what did it cost?
What did he pay you to do this?

01:32:18.668 --> 01:32:20.401
Nothing.

01:32:22.271 --> 01:32:26.707
So why? Why would a person
do that sort of thing?

01:32:28.744 --> 01:32:31.345
The practice.

01:32:33.282 --> 01:32:35.082
Hm.

01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:42.757
You just never know how.

01:33:00.442 --> 01:33:04.245
Hey, junior, can we get
going before I miss Santa?

01:33:04.247 --> 01:33:06.447
Give me a minute.

01:33:21.163 --> 01:33:22.797
What's wrong?

01:33:22.799 --> 01:33:24.932
What was your job in
that store with those men?

01:33:24.934 --> 01:33:27.535
It doesn't matter.

01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:30.104
I got her back.

01:33:37.646 --> 01:33:41.248
Why'd you gotta go do that?
Why?

01:33:43.552 --> 01:33:45.119
I wanted to believe you.

01:33:45.121 --> 01:33:47.755
Penny, forget about
the camera store.

01:33:47.757 --> 01:33:50.625
You said you weren't mean.

01:33:50.627 --> 01:33:52.593
I wanted to listen to
all your little lies...

01:33:52.595 --> 01:33:54.795
And try and understand them.

01:33:54.797 --> 01:33:56.397
I was willing to do all that...

01:33:56.399 --> 01:34:01.402
Because I am tired of being
cold... and I liked you.

01:34:03.071 --> 01:34:05.673
And I thought you liked me.
I do.

01:34:05.675 --> 01:34:07.174
You're a liar.

01:34:07.176 --> 01:34:09.944
I'm a liar?

01:34:09.946 --> 01:34:11.846
You know I saw some
pictures of you today...

01:34:11.848 --> 01:34:14.982
That tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

01:34:14.984 --> 01:34:18.419
Grossinger's.

01:34:18.421 --> 01:34:22.289
The man in them,
Dr. Dave lobell.

01:34:22.291 --> 01:34:24.258
No.

01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:26.794
I know his kids.

01:34:28.130 --> 01:34:29.830
His wife.

01:34:31.633 --> 01:34:33.768
You saw?

01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:35.970
Everything.

01:34:36.872 --> 01:34:40.174
He was sick... dying.

01:34:41.643 --> 01:34:45.046
Okay, okay, let's forget it.

01:34:46.815 --> 01:34:51.052
You want to stay at my
place a couple of nights, okay.

01:34:55.824 --> 01:34:58.459
That's what you think of me?

01:34:59.728 --> 01:35:01.462
It's like a gift two people
give each other...

01:35:01.464 --> 01:35:03.898
Like Christmas presents.

01:35:05.467 --> 01:35:06.867
Okay.

01:35:08.970 --> 01:35:10.638
Let's go.

01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:14.075
It is freezing.

01:35:20.682 --> 01:35:23.851
Eyes in the back of my head.

01:35:26.088 --> 01:35:27.521
What?

01:35:32.094 --> 01:35:34.428
Are you coming with me or not?

01:35:53.849 --> 01:35:56.350
Stay away from me!

01:37:57.272 --> 01:37:58.739
Eh.

01:37:58.741 --> 01:38:01.208
Oh, shit.

01:38:01.210 --> 01:38:04.545
Well, that means you won't be
giving me a lift home then.

01:38:09.517 --> 01:38:11.151
Thought you'd be at the parrot.

01:38:11.153 --> 01:38:16.490
No... populated by lonely,
pathetic, old drunks.

01:38:21.329 --> 01:38:23.764
So this is Christmas.
Uh-huh.

01:38:23.766 --> 01:38:27.067
First Christmas in god knows
how many years...

01:38:27.069 --> 01:38:31.238
I have nothing better
to do than actually enjoy it.

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:33.107
Christ, it's cold, though,
isn't it?

01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:36.243
But I do love the snow,
you know.

01:38:36.245 --> 01:38:40.547
Makes me think I'm a kid again.
Can do anything at all.

01:38:42.317 --> 01:38:45.052
Do you remember Daphne?

01:38:46.721 --> 01:38:48.122
Wife number four.

01:38:48.124 --> 01:38:52.593
Her daughter, well, my daughter,
actually the only daughter...

01:38:52.595 --> 01:38:55.596
That still speaks to me,
god bless her.

01:38:55.598 --> 01:38:57.932
Anyway, she and that little
prick of a husband of hers...

01:38:57.934 --> 01:39:00.301
Are holding some sort
of a soiree this evening.

01:39:00.303 --> 01:39:01.535
All her kids are going
to be there.

01:39:01.537 --> 01:39:03.270
You should see those kids
when I come.

01:39:03.272 --> 01:39:05.606
I tell you, open the door
and they holler...

01:39:05.608 --> 01:39:08.542
And I'll just give 'em a little,
you know, a little song...

01:39:08.544 --> 01:39:09.944
A little shuffle.

01:39:09.946 --> 01:39:12.446
And they love it.

01:39:12.448 --> 01:39:17.151
Love is too small a word, Ray.
Too small a word.

01:39:19.187 --> 01:39:23.891
So I was thinking I might
just stop by.

01:39:25.927 --> 01:39:27.494
Want to come?

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.667
Why not?

01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:35.235
Good.

01:39:35.704 --> 01:39:36.837
You know the last bus left...

01:39:36.839 --> 01:39:39.640
So wherever we go,
we're hoofing it.

01:39:39.642 --> 01:39:42.977
I've got this feeling.
It's a salesman's gift.

01:39:42.979 --> 01:39:46.080
I've got this feeling that
something marvelous...

01:39:46.082 --> 01:39:48.082
Is gonna happen around
that corner.

01:39:50.018 --> 01:39:54.822
You know what, Ray, been so long
since I've walked anywhere...

01:39:54.824 --> 01:39:57.658
I'm not sure I know the way.

01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:00.327
Don't worry, pinky? I do.
