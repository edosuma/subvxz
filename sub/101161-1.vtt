03:30.708 --> 03:31.540
What, what?

03:31.540 --> 03:32.376
Captain?

03:41.960 --> 03:42.792
- What was that?

03:47.040 --> 03:48.208
- A whale?

03:48.208 --> 03:49.916
- Whales don't sound like that.

03:49.916 --> 03:50.832
- What, you get a lotta whales

03:50.832 --> 03:52.292
on the Lower East Side, Bigelow?

03:52.292 --> 03:53.124
- Listen.

04:06.708 --> 04:08.084
It's a ship.

04:08.084 --> 04:08.916
- A ship?

04:09.876 --> 04:10.876
We're saved?

04:12.252 --> 04:15.208
- Faraday, give your life
vest to Miss Prescott.

04:15.208 --> 04:18.000
- Oh, for heaven sake,
the man has a broken arm.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.959
Ahoy, over here!

04:19.959 --> 04:22.460
- Oi, sit down you fat
head, you'll capsize us.

04:22.460 --> 04:24.208
- Don't you touch me.

04:24.208 --> 04:25.040
- Look.

04:29.668 --> 04:30.500
- Great.

04:31.376 --> 04:33.040
Fuckin' Nazis.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.460
- I don't care if it's Hitler's
personal pleasure cruiser.

04:35.460 --> 04:37.292
This is the only ship
that we've come across

04:37.292 --> 04:38.460
the last two--
- Keep your voice down.

04:38.460 --> 04:41.000
- And what are they
gonna do, shoot us?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.500
We're dead anyways.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.584
- He's right, Captain.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.708
The Russian's are done.

04:46.708 --> 04:49.500
- Chances are they'll
shoot me on sight,

04:49.500 --> 04:51.624
but I guess that's better
than starvin' to death.

04:51.624 --> 04:56.624
We got to get off this raft,
simple as that Captain.

04:56.752 --> 04:58.624
- What about her?

04:58.624 --> 05:02.792
What do you think those sons
of bitches will do to her?

05:02.792 --> 05:04.708
- I'll not have any of
your deaths on my hands.

05:04.708 --> 05:07.208
We'll live to fight
another day, hm?

05:07.208 --> 05:08.040
All of us.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.292
- Perhaps we could consider
some of the other options.

05:11.292 --> 05:14.040
I simply mustn't be allowed
to fall into enemy hands.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.792
- What makes you
so bloody special?

05:15.792 --> 05:17.376
- Surely there's something
more we can do besides--

05:17.376 --> 05:18.584
- Can it, Specks.

05:18.584 --> 05:20.124
We'll hitch a ride
with the krauts.

05:41.252 --> 05:44.252
Brace yourselves!

05:46.292 --> 05:47.124
Hey!

05:47.124 --> 05:48.500
- Captain Malone
and Sinclair: Hey!

05:48.500 --> 05:49.332
Hey!

05:49.332 --> 05:50.832
- Down here!
- Hey!

05:50.832 --> 05:52.668
- Hello!
- Hey!

05:52.668 --> 05:56.000
You dirty bastards!

05:56.000 --> 05:57.376
- I can't see anyone on deck.

05:57.376 --> 05:58.208
- Hello!
- Hey!

05:58.208 --> 05:59.168
- Hello!
- Hey!

05:59.168 --> 06:00.000
Ahoy!

06:00.000 --> 06:00.876
- Hello?
- Hey!

06:02.752 --> 06:03.668
- What are you doin'?

06:03.668 --> 06:05.252
- Need a tow-line.

06:06.292 --> 06:07.124
Shit!

06:07.124 --> 06:08.168
Everybody hold still.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.040
Oh!

06:13.876 --> 06:15.460
- How many bullets left?

06:15.460 --> 06:17.540
- Wait a God damn minute.

06:19.792 --> 06:21.208
You speak English?

06:21.208 --> 06:22.540
- I never said I could not.

06:22.540 --> 06:23.584
Well,
this is just perfect.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.460
- How many bullets?

06:24.460 --> 06:25.292
- One.

06:29.708 --> 06:30.624
- Sniper?

06:30.624 --> 06:33.376
- Nah, we're not gonna give
our only rifle to the Russian.

06:33.376 --> 06:34.292
- Yeah, especially
to a guy who's

06:34.292 --> 06:35.876
been spyin' on
us the whole time.

06:35.876 --> 06:36.876
You can't trust this guy.

06:36.876 --> 06:40.040
- What's he gonna
do with one bullet?

06:40.040 --> 06:42.292
- Hopefully not miss.

06:50.584 --> 06:53.916
- You buyin' it
or firing it Ivan?

06:53.916 --> 06:56.084
- The Enfield, Mark One.

06:56.084 --> 06:57.624
Old action rifle.

06:57.624 --> 07:00.708
Shoots to left if not
properly re-calibrated.

07:00.708 --> 07:02.000
- I swear to God,
Ivan if you miss--

07:02.000 --> 07:04.208
- Look, would you just shut up
and let the man concentrate?

07:04.208 --> 07:05.624
- Gentlemen, we're
running out of ship.

07:20.460 --> 07:21.960
He got it!

07:21.960 --> 07:22.792
Grab it.

07:22.792 --> 07:23.624
Grab it!

07:24.584 --> 07:25.416
Grab it!

07:26.292 --> 07:27.208
Pull.

07:27.208 --> 07:28.040
Pull!

07:32.168 --> 07:33.000
- Heave!

07:34.792 --> 07:35.624
- Pull!

07:36.876 --> 07:37.960
Get up there Teplov.

07:40.332 --> 07:41.540
Captain, hold on.

07:41.540 --> 07:44.584
Come on, come on, pull, pull.

07:44.584 --> 07:45.416
- Ivan!

07:46.792 --> 07:47.960
- Come on, come on climb.

07:47.960 --> 07:48.792
- Climb.

07:50.916 --> 07:52.792
- Who up now?

07:52.792 --> 07:55.084
Miss Prescott, Miss
Prescott my hand.

07:55.084 --> 07:56.584
- You got her?
- Thank you.

07:56.584 --> 07:58.252
Bigelow?

07:58.252 --> 07:59.540
- Come on.
- Come on Bigelow.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.208
- Come on.
- Jackson?

08:02.040 --> 08:02.916
Faraday, come on.

08:02.916 --> 08:03.752
- I couldn't
possibly, it's my arm.

08:03.752 --> 08:05.040
- Mr. Faraday, come on.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.208
- Captain, come on!
- Come on Mr. Faraday.

08:06.208 --> 08:07.084
Give me your hand.

08:07.084 --> 08:08.292
Mr. Faraday, Sir?
- Come on.

08:08.292 --> 08:10.000
- Come here.
- We don't have all day mate!

08:10.000 --> 08:10.832
- Come on.
- No!

08:10.832 --> 08:11.708
- Grab a hold.
- No, no.

08:11.708 --> 08:12.540
- Come on.
- Get on.

08:12.540 --> 08:14.084
Get up here.

08:14.084 --> 08:14.916
Come on here, here.

08:14.916 --> 08:15.708
Get on Faraday.

08:15.708 --> 08:16.540
Up you go, come on.

08:16.540 --> 08:17.376
Grab him, grab him.

08:17.376 --> 08:18.208
Come on.

08:18.208 --> 08:20.040
- All right, move, move, move.

08:20.040 --> 08:20.876
Here we go.

08:20.876 --> 08:21.708
- All right.

08:21.708 --> 08:22.584
Oh, damn.

08:22.584 --> 08:23.540
Come on Captain.

08:24.376 --> 08:25.208
- Captain!

08:25.208 --> 08:26.040
Come on Captain.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.124
Grab him Jackson.

08:27.124 --> 08:28.208
Come on Cap.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.668
There we go.

08:31.252 --> 08:32.083
- Pull him up!

08:32.083 --> 08:33.251
- Come on!
- Come on Captain!

08:33.251 --> 08:34.168
- Come on Captain.

08:35.792 --> 08:37.207
You're a damn fool Captain.

08:39.460 --> 08:40.292
Captain!

08:41.707 --> 08:42.832
Captain!
- Jesus Christ!

08:45.252 --> 08:47.460
- Hey, hey.
- What?

08:47.460 --> 08:48.376
Captain!

08:48.376 --> 08:50.332
- Jackson, I'm sorry he's gone.

08:50.332 --> 08:51.168
He's gone.

08:52.124 --> 08:52.960
Yeah, he's gone.

08:52.960 --> 08:53.792
Come on, everyone.

09:25.376 --> 09:27.168
- How's that hand Mr. Faraday?

09:27.168 --> 09:28.000
- No, no, no.

09:33.668 --> 09:35.208
Gerard...

09:35.208 --> 09:37.292
I, look, I...

09:38.500 --> 09:41.000
- The Englishman
has many secrets.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.168
- You're one to talk.

09:42.168 --> 09:43.416
- You limey weasel.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.832
- You were gonna
let us starve to death

09:44.832 --> 09:46.500
so you could live
a few more days.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.376
- You'd have done the same if

09:47.376 --> 09:49.000
you had the
brains to think of it.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.332
The work I do affects
the lives of millions.

09:51.332 --> 09:53.540
You're just meat
for the grinder.

09:54.376 --> 09:55.208
- Oh!

09:55.208 --> 09:56.084
Leave him alone.

09:56.084 --> 09:57.500
He's harmless.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.292
- He's a coward is what he is.

09:59.292 --> 10:00.416
- Who's to say that fuckin' arm

10:00.416 --> 10:01.792
ain't even broken?
- Hey, hey, hey.

10:01.792 --> 10:02.624
- Yeah, why don't we

10:02.624 --> 10:03.460
just throw him overboard?
- Hey!

10:03.460 --> 10:04.460
- Oh, enough!

10:04.460 --> 10:05.500
In case you'd
forgotten we're all

10:05.500 --> 10:08.332
on the same side,
now act like it.

10:09.460 --> 10:11.252
- You know what
I think is strange?

10:11.252 --> 10:12.124
- Oh, what?

10:16.708 --> 10:19.960
- All this, this
fighting and shouting.

10:21.792 --> 10:23.792
No one comes to see, hm?

10:39.668 --> 10:42.084
- It's one bloody thing
after another isn't it?

10:42.084 --> 10:43.792
- Let's take shelter.

10:43.792 --> 10:45.416
- Amen to that toots.

10:46.832 --> 10:50.668
Mr. Sinclair,
perhaps you could help.

10:51.876 --> 10:52.960
Come on.

11:25.208 --> 11:26.876
- Engine's runnin' but--

11:26.876 --> 11:28.376
- Nobody's home.

11:28.376 --> 11:29.832
It seems that way.

11:29.832 --> 11:31.500
- We can't stay out here.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.668
- Well, if you wanna
go stumbling around

11:32.668 --> 11:34.584
in the dark go
knock yourself out.

11:37.668 --> 11:39.252
After you ladybird.

11:40.752 --> 11:41.584
- Oi.

11:42.668 --> 11:43.916
What have you and uh, Ivan--

11:43.916 --> 11:45.540
Teplov.

11:45.540 --> 11:46.376
- What?

11:46.376 --> 11:48.960
- Junior Sergeant
Alexander Teplov.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.292
With the four keeps--
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

11:51.292 --> 11:52.292
Sniper.

11:52.292 --> 11:53.124
- Yeah.

11:53.124 --> 11:54.040
- Yeah, got it.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.792
Why don't you and Bigelow
head up to the bridge?

11:56.792 --> 11:59.416
See who's steerin'
the thing, huh?

11:59.416 --> 12:02.708
- I'm not goin' anywhere
with the fascist.

12:02.708 --> 12:04.460
- Communist, dickhead.

12:05.332 --> 12:06.168
- What's the difference?

12:06.168 --> 12:08.960
- Hey look, why don't you just
do what the man says Bigelow?

12:08.960 --> 12:12.460
- And since when did you
start givin' me orders?

12:16.752 --> 12:19.124
- Come, I do not bite.

12:28.584 --> 12:29.584
- Gosh he's smug.

12:34.252 --> 12:37.416
- You know you're
gonna get frostbite?

12:39.168 --> 12:42.084
- Yeah, I've been through worse.

12:42.084 --> 12:44.708
- All you Cossacks
are a bit loony.

12:44.708 --> 12:46.752
- And you Americans
talk too much.

12:50.124 --> 12:52.124
- I preferred when
you didn't talk at all.

12:55.168 --> 12:57.960
- We need to get his
arm back into a sling.

13:00.876 --> 13:01.708
- Hm.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.584
- Yes, Ma'am.

13:05.624 --> 13:07.416
- Thank you Mr. Sinclair.

13:37.540 --> 13:39.124
- Fuck, it's mouldy.

13:42.708 --> 13:44.540
You wanna point that
outta my fuckin' face?

13:48.040 --> 13:49.708
Jesus man.

13:49.708 --> 13:50.540
Fuck.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.624
Oh.

13:53.624 --> 13:54.460
Oh.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.084
- Here you go.

13:58.084 --> 13:59.168
Courtesy of the Fuhrer.

14:01.124 --> 14:03.292
- It's not exactly my colour.

14:03.292 --> 14:05.208
- A sling, your majesty.

14:06.540 --> 14:07.832
- Colonist.

14:07.832 --> 14:08.832
- Imperialist.

14:08.832 --> 14:10.416
- Convict.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.252
- Wanker.

14:13.000 --> 14:13.916
Over here.

14:16.416 --> 14:17.460
- You go.

14:17.460 --> 14:19.000
- Okay.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.040
You gonna be all
right Miss Prescott?

14:21.040 --> 14:22.124
- We're fine.

14:37.124 --> 14:40.540
- It was a cowardly
thing I did, I know.

14:40.540 --> 14:43.168
- I've seen men do
far worse in this war.

14:54.708 --> 14:55.668
Sinclair!

15:07.624 --> 15:08.540
- Hey.

15:13.376 --> 15:14.624
- You ought to know.

15:18.876 --> 15:19.708
- Blimey.

15:21.292 --> 15:22.124
The life boats have

15:22.124 --> 15:25.208
been sabotaged too.
- Oh, you're kidding me man?

15:27.584 --> 15:29.624
- You ever seen
anything like this before?

15:29.624 --> 15:33.540
- I have seen gas
turn a man inside out,

15:33.540 --> 15:35.460
but nothing like this.

15:35.460 --> 15:36.832
- Whatever it is it's startin'

15:36.832 --> 15:38.752
to give me the creeps all right?

15:38.752 --> 15:40.332
There's somethin' wrong here.

15:40.332 --> 15:43.292
- I knew farmers who
took up arms against

15:43.292 --> 15:45.752
the Wehrmacht with more
courage than you.

15:45.752 --> 15:47.752
- Hey, what do you want from me?

15:47.752 --> 15:49.668
I'm a God damn cook, all right?

15:49.668 --> 15:51.376
Three years in that
fuckin' war and then

15:51.376 --> 15:53.916
I get torpedoed my way
home and then I get stuck

15:53.916 --> 15:57.376
on that God forsaken raft
with no food and no water

15:57.376 --> 15:59.624
and now you're tellin' me
that my only fuckin' chance

15:59.624 --> 16:03.040
of hope is on some God
forsaken ghost ship?

16:03.040 --> 16:04.584
On top of it you
forgot to mention

16:04.584 --> 16:07.292
I got stuck with you, you
cloak and dagger asshole

16:07.292 --> 16:10.708
and that limey prick
and you, Australia.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.752
I ain't even know you
people were in the war.

16:12.752 --> 16:13.960
- Pull your head in mate.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.540
- Hey, I ain't your mate, okay?

16:16.540 --> 16:19.040
I don't owe you people nothin'.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.084
We got stuck in the same war

16:20.084 --> 16:22.040
and now get stuck
in the same boat.

16:22.040 --> 16:25.292
- Yeah, we did and
we're still breathin'.

16:25.292 --> 16:29.376
- I just want lady luck to
smile on me just this once.

16:29.376 --> 16:31.624
- It ain't about luck mate.

16:32.876 --> 16:34.376
It ain't.

16:34.376 --> 16:36.708
It's about how you play
the hand you're dealt.

16:40.168 --> 16:43.876
Look, keep this to
ourselves for now.

16:49.416 --> 16:51.252
- All right.

16:51.252 --> 16:52.084
Okay.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.415
No shoes.

17:07.415 --> 17:09.167
- What's your excuse?

17:11.415 --> 17:13.584
- I was in bunk
when torpedo hit.

17:20.460 --> 17:22.624
- Oh, you poor thing.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.500
We'll get you out of
the retched weather.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.832
We'll find a sickbay, okay?

17:25.832 --> 17:27.667
- So you're British
Intelligence?

17:30.292 --> 17:31.624
- Something like that.

17:31.624 --> 17:32.460
Oh, oh.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.500
- How'd you get here?

17:34.500 --> 17:37.292
- He needs rest Mr. Jackson,
not an interrogation.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.376
Watch your step.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.668
- You guys find anything?

17:45.668 --> 17:48.832
- Uh, no just a busted
compass and uh,

17:49.792 --> 17:52.916
someone chained
the wheel, no Jerries?

17:52.916 --> 17:55.584
- Yeah, just don't jinx it, huh?

17:56.416 --> 17:57.252
- Yeah.

18:23.624 --> 18:26.208
- Bet this tug's still
crawlin' with krauts.

18:33.624 --> 18:34.792
- What's that?

18:40.084 --> 18:40.916
- It's a doll.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.540
- It's really old.

18:45.416 --> 18:46.252
- Spooky.

18:47.916 --> 18:49.708
It's an antique.

18:49.708 --> 18:52.376
- Oh, you're some
kind of expert are ya?

18:52.376 --> 18:57.376
- An antique dealer actually
in another life before the war.

18:57.916 --> 19:00.584
- Of course you were, Gerard.

19:02.960 --> 19:03.792
- May I?

19:08.916 --> 19:10.208
Oh.

19:10.208 --> 19:14.832
Pierre-Francois Jumeau,
finest doll makers in Paris.

19:14.832 --> 19:16.752
Hm, 1780 - 1830 I'd say.

19:19.416 --> 19:21.624
- Is it worth anything?

19:21.624 --> 19:23.460
- A thousand pounds.

19:23.460 --> 19:25.376
Perhaps more at auction.

19:25.376 --> 19:27.916
- Well that's a whole lotta
clams for a kid's toy.

19:30.084 --> 19:31.708
- What the hell's it doin' here?

19:45.208 --> 19:46.040
- Jackson?

19:48.376 --> 19:50.124
How do you feel
about switchin' sides?

19:50.124 --> 19:51.416
- Hey, if it means us gettin'

19:51.416 --> 19:54.540
out of these wet
drawers sign me up.

19:57.876 --> 20:00.960
All
there is I'm afraid.

20:16.040 --> 20:19.584
- Man, how many
times you been shot?

20:19.584 --> 20:21.708
- Not all bullets.

20:21.708 --> 20:25.000
Some is knife,
some is cigarette.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.500
This one wild pig.

20:28.252 --> 20:29.668
It's long story.

20:32.916 --> 20:33.752
- Oh my...

20:36.752 --> 20:38.292
Sorry.

20:38.292 --> 20:39.208
- Don't be.

20:41.168 --> 20:42.416
Just a scratch.

20:43.916 --> 20:45.916
- Where'd you get those?

20:49.208 --> 20:50.584
- Tobruk.

20:50.584 --> 20:51.832
Panzer division.

20:52.792 --> 20:55.040
Blasted us to buggery.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.208
- All that time of the life boat

20:56.208 --> 20:58.124
and you didn't say anything.

20:58.124 --> 21:00.040
- Three years as a POW.

21:01.916 --> 21:03.332
Not much to tell.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.752
Shelly, my wife.

21:13.624 --> 21:18.208
They told her I was killed
in action, so she remarried.

21:19.916 --> 21:21.584
She's happy.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.708
She's had a baby.

21:23.708 --> 21:25.292
Few months old now.

21:27.668 --> 21:30.584
I wanna see her
just one last time.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.624
Don't blame her for movin' on.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.376
Life's too short.

21:38.792 --> 21:40.292
It's too bloody short.

21:46.252 --> 21:47.624
- You'll see her again.

21:51.708 --> 21:54.168
- What about you tough guy?

21:54.168 --> 21:55.584
You got family?

21:57.832 --> 21:59.000
- Not anymore.

22:01.416 --> 22:03.040
I'm
sorry to hear that.

22:10.252 --> 22:12.252
- Such small feet these Nazis.

22:20.332 --> 22:23.752
- Boiler room, ammunitions,
galley, radio room.

22:23.752 --> 22:26.752
Let's see if we can reach
anyone on the shortwave.

22:26.752 --> 22:27.752
- All right.

22:27.752 --> 22:28.624
I wanna take a
look at the engine

22:28.624 --> 22:31.792
and see what's
keepin' her runnin'.

22:31.792 --> 22:34.168
- No offence Jackson
but you're a cook.

22:34.168 --> 22:36.960
- Oh yeah, he's a real demon
with the ladle this guy.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.792
- I worked in a
shipyard before the war

22:38.792 --> 22:40.292
and the mechanics before that.

22:40.292 --> 22:41.124
- Okay then.

22:41.124 --> 22:42.168
- Remind me, what did you do
- Okay.

22:42.168 --> 22:44.460
- before slingin'
last week Bigelow?

22:44.460 --> 22:45.292
- Two groups.

22:45.292 --> 22:48.084
Jackson, Bigelow
with uh, Teplov.

22:48.084 --> 22:50.832
Miss Prescott and
Faraday with me.

22:50.832 --> 22:52.332
Meet back in the
galley when we're done.

22:52.332 --> 22:53.752
- All right then.

22:55.792 --> 22:56.624
- Bloody Yanks.

23:27.668 --> 23:28.500
- German.

23:30.332 --> 23:31.168
- Do you know
what they're saying?

23:34.708 --> 23:36.124
- Bits and pieces.

23:39.460 --> 23:40.584
- I think they're
looking for this ship.

23:42.876 --> 23:44.208
- Don't be daft, say something.

23:44.208 --> 23:45.708
Just speak, go on.

23:46.960 --> 23:50.416
- We're on a German ship
without any Germans on it

23:50.416 --> 23:53.084
and you wanna just
invite some along.

23:53.084 --> 23:54.540
Go on genius.

23:54.540 --> 23:55.876
- Mm, brilliant.

24:00.668 --> 24:02.460
- Must be someone else.

24:11.792 --> 24:13.040
- Oh, not good.

24:14.168 --> 24:15.584
This is not good.

24:17.540 --> 24:20.708
- You care to uh, humour me
with specifics Mr. Jackson?

24:20.708 --> 24:23.124
- Uh, the boiler
must be runnin' dry.

24:23.124 --> 24:25.208
Engine pressure's
through the roof.

24:25.208 --> 24:26.332
- So, who gives a shit?

24:26.332 --> 24:28.332
- Look, if the boiler
runs dry and the engine

24:28.332 --> 24:30.460
is still running it could
set off a chain reaction.

24:30.460 --> 24:33.168
If it reaches the
munitions room,

24:33.168 --> 24:35.500
it can blow this
whole ship to pieces.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.584
This tub's a ticking time bomb.

24:37.584 --> 24:38.832
- So turn it off.

24:38.832 --> 24:40.168
- That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

24:40.168 --> 24:41.668
- No, hold the fuck up.

24:41.668 --> 24:43.252
You're not shuttin'
this ship down.

24:43.252 --> 24:44.832
- Look we don't know how
much fuel we got left.

24:44.832 --> 24:45.832
A day, maybe less.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.416
We can always
turn it back on once

24:47.416 --> 24:48.960
we realise where
the hell we're goin'.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.168
Teplov, grab that other wheel.

24:50.168 --> 24:52.668
- Don't fuckin' touch
that wheel, okay?

24:52.668 --> 24:54.124
Listen to me, listen to me.

24:54.124 --> 24:55.916
If you shut it off
how do we know

24:55.916 --> 24:57.208
we're gonna turn it back on?

24:57.208 --> 24:58.252
- I'd rather be
dead in the water

24:58.252 --> 25:00.416
then literally
dead in the water.

25:00.416 --> 25:01.252
Wouldn't you?

25:03.500 --> 25:05.040
Teplov, grab that wheel.

25:05.040 --> 25:05.832
- Fuck that, no.

25:05.832 --> 25:07.292
- God damn it.

25:07.292 --> 25:09.668
Listen, I have been
smiling through

25:09.668 --> 25:13.168
your bullshit for
two and a half years.

25:13.168 --> 25:16.040
Do you see me smilin' now?

25:16.040 --> 25:18.584
Look, you're not
my boss anymore.

25:18.584 --> 25:20.792
Down here what I say goes.

25:31.460 --> 25:36.208
You can try to stop me but
I wouldn't recommend it.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.124
Do we have ourselves
an understanding?

25:53.540 --> 25:54.376
You gravy?

25:57.252 --> 25:58.084
- Gravy.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.500
- Three, two, one.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.500
- Jackson.

26:24.540 --> 26:25.376
- What the?

26:31.500 --> 26:32.500
All right, that's it.

26:32.500 --> 26:33.332
Fuck this thing.

26:33.332 --> 26:35.876
I want off this God damn ride.

26:35.876 --> 26:37.876
- Sweet mother of mercy.

26:40.876 --> 26:42.084
Not again.

26:42.084 --> 26:43.292
- What?

26:43.292 --> 26:45.208
What do you mean not again?

26:45.208 --> 26:47.584
What, is there somethin'
you're not tellin' me Bigelow?

26:47.584 --> 26:49.832
- German sailor on bridge.

26:49.832 --> 26:51.376
- And you didn't say anything?

26:51.376 --> 26:52.752
- It was Sinclair's
idea all right?

26:52.752 --> 26:56.000
He told us not to say anything
until we knew what it meant.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.124
- It meant somethin'
bad Bigelow.

26:58.124 --> 27:00.376
Damn, I mean dead bodies
usually mean somethin' bad.

27:21.416 --> 27:24.292
- That's two weeks old at least.

27:24.292 --> 27:25.708
- I've had worse.

27:27.252 --> 27:28.084
- Ah.

27:30.668 --> 27:31.832
- Oi, Jackson?

27:32.876 --> 27:33.876
Why'd you turn the engines off?

27:33.876 --> 27:34.708
- Had to.

27:34.708 --> 27:36.500
The boiler was about to blow.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.084
- We could've
discussed it first, mate.

27:38.084 --> 27:39.416
- That's what I said.

27:39.416 --> 27:41.000
- I made the call.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.168
I made the call
just like you did

27:43.168 --> 27:44.876
about the dead
body on the bridge.

27:44.876 --> 27:45.708
- What?

27:45.708 --> 27:46.584
- Decapitated, right?

27:46.584 --> 27:48.376
With all the funky veins
runnin' through it?

27:48.376 --> 27:51.376
Well there's more down in
the engine room burned alive.

27:51.376 --> 27:53.124
- I didn't wanna cause
a panic, Jackson.

27:55.252 --> 27:57.876
- We need to be able to
trust each other, Sinclair.

27:57.876 --> 27:58.876
- Yeah we do, Jackson.

27:58.876 --> 27:59.708
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:59.708 --> 28:00.540
- Stop.

28:02.916 --> 28:05.876
While I appreciate your
decision making Mr. Jackson,

28:05.876 --> 28:08.624
and your discretion,
Mr. Sinclair,

28:09.500 --> 28:12.124
right now we have food,
clothing and shelter

28:12.124 --> 28:14.752
and it appears we have this
entire boat to ourselves.

28:14.752 --> 28:17.792
Our present predicament is
far better than yesterday's.

28:17.792 --> 28:20.376
Who knows what
tomorrow may bring, hey?

28:20.376 --> 28:22.168
So for now let's eat.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.416
"An army marches
on its stomach."

28:24.416 --> 28:25.292
- Hang on.

28:25.292 --> 28:26.960
Did you just make that up?

28:26.960 --> 28:30.500
- I think you'll find
that's Napoleon Bonaparte.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.624
- You need to eat too Mr.
Faraday, keep your strength up.

28:33.624 --> 28:36.540
- You are an absolute
angel Miss Prescott.

28:36.540 --> 28:39.040
- Yeah, and don't choke on it.

28:40.208 --> 28:41.916
- Sorry Miss Prescott.

28:41.916 --> 28:42.876
- I'm sorry too.

28:42.876 --> 28:45.540
- Can I at least buy you dinner?

28:47.124 --> 28:48.084
Wehrmacht's finest.

28:48.084 --> 28:50.752
Thank you Mr. Sinclair.

28:50.752 --> 28:52.960
- Look, there's no um...

28:52.960 --> 28:54.252
- You don't like fish mate?

28:54.252 --> 28:55.084
- There's no ring.

28:55.084 --> 28:56.000
- That's all you're
getting mate.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.916
Could you
possibly open this?

28:57.916 --> 28:58.752
Yes mate.

29:10.252 --> 29:11.084
- What was it?

29:11.084 --> 29:12.376
- Some kind of
child or somethin'.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.208
- A child?

29:13.208 --> 29:15.000
Yeah, a child who
scared the shit out of me.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.168
Okay come
on, come on guys.

29:35.460 --> 29:36.376
Oh.

29:47.624 --> 29:51.332
Oh.

29:54.540 --> 29:57.416
Someone hacked
the lifeboats to bits.

29:57.416 --> 29:59.124
- Excuse me?

29:59.124 --> 30:01.124
Why would he do that?

30:01.124 --> 30:03.376
- So nobody could leave.

30:03.376 --> 30:06.708
- Hey, please don't
think about it Ivan.

30:08.124 --> 30:09.040
- Gasoline.

30:13.252 --> 30:14.708
- He's right.

30:14.708 --> 30:16.376
It smells like fuel.

30:18.624 --> 30:21.376
Marvellous.

30:21.376 --> 30:22.208
Marvellous.

30:23.084 --> 30:26.708
So, so, mad captain
loses his marbles,

30:26.708 --> 30:29.252
gets a bit axe
happy with his men,

30:29.252 --> 30:31.708
sets them on fire
and then sabotages

30:31.708 --> 30:34.500
their only means of escape.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.292
Not to mention ours.

30:36.292 --> 30:37.124
- Shut up Faraday.

30:37.124 --> 30:37.960
- Yeah.

30:39.792 --> 30:42.376
- But then who did this to him?

30:44.084 --> 30:44.916
- Rats.

30:47.084 --> 30:47.916
Big rats.

31:02.292 --> 31:03.460
Miss Prescott?

31:07.084 --> 31:08.416
- Hello darling.

31:10.332 --> 31:11.500
Is this yours?

31:12.916 --> 31:14.252
Don't be scared.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.460
It's all right.

31:28.040 --> 31:28.876
Ow.

31:28.876 --> 31:30.292
Did she bite you?

31:30.292 --> 31:31.124
It's fine.

31:31.124 --> 31:31.960
Just a scratch.

31:31.960 --> 31:32.960
- Little monster.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.876
- Who knows how long she's
been here on her own,

31:35.876 --> 31:38.460
or what she's been
through poor thing.

31:40.624 --> 31:41.460
It's okay.

31:50.332 --> 31:51.752
We're scared too.

31:52.916 --> 31:54.876
We're
not gonna hurt you.

32:05.168 --> 32:06.084
- That's family.

32:06.084 --> 32:08.040
- What's that?

32:08.040 --> 32:09.252
- Uh, sounds Italian.

32:09.252 --> 32:10.876
Somethin' about family.

32:10.876 --> 32:12.416
Family is.

32:12.416 --> 32:14.208
- Okay, so she's
speakin' Italian?

32:14.208 --> 32:17.208
- No, no, no, no it just,
not it's not Italian.

32:17.208 --> 32:18.708
It just sounds similar.

32:18.708 --> 32:19.624
- Romanian.

32:21.668 --> 32:22.876
I recognise it.

32:28.292 --> 32:30.040
- Hey, once bitten...

32:31.460 --> 32:32.460
- It's okay.

32:39.376 --> 32:40.208
Oh.

32:43.168 --> 32:44.000
Hm.

32:45.292 --> 32:46.540
- What is that?

32:48.708 --> 32:50.668
That looks old.

32:50.668 --> 32:53.500
Looks like it's worth somethin'.

32:53.500 --> 32:54.332
What?

32:54.332 --> 32:56.084
Well, clearly he
doesn't need it.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.540
Now we're talkin'.

33:00.540 --> 33:01.376
Oh.
- Nothing broken

33:01.376 --> 33:02.208
and nothing bruised?

33:02.208 --> 33:04.460
Nasty.

33:06.584 --> 33:08.668
Any bullets?

33:10.124 --> 33:12.376
- About half a dozen maybe.

33:14.832 --> 33:16.124
- Wanna trade?

33:18.292 --> 33:19.208
- Nice try.

33:20.916 --> 33:22.416
- You're okay, hm?

33:24.540 --> 33:26.168
Jane.

33:26.168 --> 33:28.668
Jane.

33:28.668 --> 33:31.540
Yes, that's me, Jane.

33:31.540 --> 33:32.960
- Mya.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.460
- Mya.

33:34.460 --> 33:35.292
- Mya.

33:35.292 --> 33:36.124
- Mya.

33:43.540 --> 33:44.500
- I'm sorry, what is happening?

33:44.500 --> 33:47.000
- She wants us to follow her.

33:47.000 --> 33:47.832
- You're honestly gonna go

33:47.832 --> 33:49.252
following some
little brat around?

33:49.252 --> 33:51.916
What on earth's she doing
here you bloody fools?

33:51.916 --> 33:53.752
- That's what we're
going to find out.

33:53.752 --> 33:55.040
Come on Gerard.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.668
- Something
happened on this ship,

33:56.668 --> 33:58.540
the ship that you forced me onto

33:58.540 --> 34:01.584
and now despite
all logic and reason

34:01.584 --> 34:03.252
you're gonna go
casually exploring.

34:03.252 --> 34:04.084
No.

34:04.084 --> 34:05.124
I'll have none of this.

34:05.124 --> 34:06.208
I mean, look at him.

34:06.208 --> 34:08.376
He loves casual exploring.

34:09.623 --> 34:10.540
- Yeah.

34:10.540 --> 34:14.376
Well uh, why don't you
hang out with old skipper?

34:14.376 --> 34:18.208
Looks like he uh,
loves antiques mate.

34:26.752 --> 34:28.668
- You want us to go down there?

34:28.668 --> 34:30.416
Faraday?

34:32.831 --> 34:34.000
- Wait for me.

34:35.123 --> 34:38.460
- What's Romanian for how
many Nazis are down there?

34:38.460 --> 34:41.500
- Bigelow, why don't you
stay up here with Faraday?

34:41.500 --> 34:43.252
- I like this idea.
- I agree.

34:43.252 --> 34:44.292
- Hey.

34:44.292 --> 34:45.123
- Hey.

34:45.123 --> 34:45.960
- No wait, Mya?

34:47.623 --> 34:48.460
Mya?

34:52.252 --> 34:55.376
Mya, you can't just run off
like that, it's dangerous.

35:03.124 --> 35:04.168
Don't shit yourself.

35:04.168 --> 35:05.252
- Oh I won't.

35:06.168 --> 35:07.668
- God damn.

35:12.500 --> 35:13.832
- Wait.

35:13.832 --> 35:17.916
Yeah, I wouldn't
touch it if I were you.

35:22.460 --> 35:23.292
Gasoline.

35:26.168 --> 35:27.668
- Hey, what is it?

35:29.752 --> 35:31.040
What is it?

35:31.040 --> 35:33.376
- Come down and
see for yourself.

35:43.252 --> 35:44.416
- I'll be damned.

35:44.416 --> 35:46.376
- Jerry! It's a goddamn Kraut!

35:48.916 --> 35:50.168
- We gotta open it.

35:50.168 --> 35:51.752
- Eh, naw.

35:51.752 --> 35:52.708
No we don't.

35:52.708 --> 35:53.916
- I think they're gonna open it.

35:53.916 --> 35:55.000
- Blithering idiots.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Are you barking mad?

35:57.000 --> 35:59.376
You've got no
idea what's in there.

35:59.376 --> 36:00.708
It could be a trap.

36:00.708 --> 36:01.540
- You know, I'm
startin' to think

36:01.540 --> 36:03.168
that shortbread
here has got a point.

36:03.168 --> 36:04.916
- Look, put a lid on it Bigelow.

36:04.916 --> 36:07.168
This man knows what
happened on this ship.

36:07.168 --> 36:09.584
I'd like to know as
well, wouldn't you?

36:11.208 --> 36:12.040
Americana?

36:12.040 --> 36:14.668
- Yeah, yeah Americana, yeah.

36:14.668 --> 36:16.252
- You are Australian.

36:16.252 --> 36:17.752
- He doesn't know
the difference mate.

36:17.752 --> 36:19.792
- We're going to open the door.

36:19.792 --> 36:21.332
Do you understand?

36:26.624 --> 36:27.540
- I can't say.

36:27.540 --> 36:28.376
Yeah.

36:30.292 --> 36:31.124
Sure you wanna do this?

36:31.124 --> 36:32.500
- Yeah.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.040
Yeah I do.

36:34.040 --> 36:35.292
- You want me to take gun?

36:35.292 --> 36:36.584
- I got it.

36:36.584 --> 36:39.708
- If you have to
shoot, don't miss.

36:39.708 --> 36:42.124
- If it comes to it, I won't.

36:43.252 --> 36:44.084
- Relax.

36:46.624 --> 36:48.124
Okay.

37:00.124 --> 37:01.792
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!

37:01.792 --> 37:02.624
- Put it down.

37:02.624 --> 37:03.752
What's happening?

37:03.752 --> 37:04.584
Shut up.

37:05.416 --> 37:06.252
- Okay, look at me.
- What?

37:06.252 --> 37:07.084
What?

37:07.084 --> 37:08.252
- Yeah.

37:08.252 --> 37:09.084
Relax.

37:10.460 --> 37:11.792
Hey, yeah look at me.

37:11.792 --> 37:12.624
Put the gun down.

37:13.460 --> 37:14.500
Jackson?

37:14.500 --> 37:15.332
- Shit.

37:16.500 --> 37:17.332
- Yeah?

37:18.252 --> 37:19.084
Calm down, calm down.

37:19.084 --> 37:19.916
Jackson, relax.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.460
- We wanna talk, yeah?

37:28.500 --> 37:29.792
Calm down, calm down.

37:29.792 --> 37:30.960
- Kind tricks?

37:32.960 --> 37:34.624
- Kind, kind tricks.

37:36.208 --> 37:37.460
No tricks.

37:37.460 --> 37:38.540
No tricks.

37:38.540 --> 37:39.376
Yeah.

37:41.792 --> 37:42.624
Okay.

37:43.540 --> 37:46.460
Looks like we're
gettin' somewhere.

37:48.460 --> 37:49.332
- That beast!

37:49.332 --> 37:51.124
That beast!

37:51.124 --> 37:51.960
- Huh?

37:52.960 --> 37:53.792
- Put it down!

37:53.792 --> 37:54.624
- Shoot him.

37:55.500 --> 37:56.500
- What's he sayin' Sinclair?

37:56.500 --> 37:57.332
- He's spooked.

37:57.332 --> 37:58.168
- Well no shit.

38:00.168 --> 38:01.000
- Do it!

38:04.708 --> 38:05.668
- Do it!
- Sinclair!

38:09.832 --> 38:10.668
- It's jammed.

38:11.500 --> 38:12.332
Well, I'd
better get out of the way.

38:12.332 --> 38:13.168
- Where you goin'?

38:13.168 --> 38:14.000
- Shoot him!

38:15.668 --> 38:16.500
Shoot him!

38:24.460 --> 38:25.292
- Jackson?

38:25.292 --> 38:28.168
- Bloody Jesus, is
anybody alive down there?

38:28.168 --> 38:29.040
Oh man.

38:32.500 --> 38:33.332
- Oh.

38:33.332 --> 38:34.708
- Anything else up your sleeve?

38:39.040 --> 38:39.876
Here.

38:40.876 --> 38:41.708
Bigelow?

38:43.792 --> 38:44.792
- You're shot.

38:49.668 --> 38:50.916
- I'm fine.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.624
Bigelow?

39:05.624 --> 39:07.292
- Gravy buddy.

39:07.292 --> 39:08.124
Gravy.

39:13.332 --> 39:14.332
- Not safe.

39:14.332 --> 39:15.168
Just wait.

39:17.124 --> 39:18.960
What was he so afraid of?

39:25.460 --> 39:27.416
- Hey ho, can I have a gun?

39:34.500 --> 39:36.292
- You can have the knife.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.040
- Actually, I'm okay.

39:41.416 --> 39:43.624
Suit yourself.

39:51.960 --> 39:55.960
Well, it looks like Fritz was
plannin' on stayin' awhile.

39:55.960 --> 39:56.792
- Yeah.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.292
Home sweet home.

40:13.668 --> 40:15.416
We need
to apply pressure.

40:18.084 --> 40:20.752
I've had
worse.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.540
This'll work.

40:22.540 --> 40:23.416
Here you go.

40:29.752 --> 40:31.416
- Sweet mother Mary.

40:33.584 --> 40:34.668
Hey Sinclair?

40:35.624 --> 40:37.292
We're gonna be rich.

40:38.584 --> 40:39.416
- Why?

40:44.708 --> 40:45.540
No we won't.

40:45.540 --> 40:48.208
You gotta hold off on
the celebrations mate.

40:48.208 --> 40:49.540
- Yeah, but this is
what I'm talkin' about.

40:49.540 --> 40:51.416
This is what I've
been talkin' about man.

40:51.416 --> 40:52.208
This is it.

40:52.208 --> 40:56.376
This is lady luck is
finally smilin' down on us.

40:56.376 --> 40:58.500
- Ain't worth Buckley's
if we don't make it home.

41:17.040 --> 41:18.540
What in the devil?

41:20.876 --> 41:23.084
We maybe wanna
keep this to ourselves?

41:23.084 --> 41:26.084
- Oh yeah, 'cause that
worked so well last time.

41:26.084 --> 41:28.084
Actually, you know what?

41:30.252 --> 41:31.416
I'm actually okay with that.

41:31.416 --> 41:33.916
We can keep this to ourselves.

41:40.500 --> 41:44.332
- It's just a little bit of
blood Mya, he'll be fine.

41:44.332 --> 41:46.124
- Teplov, big enough?

41:53.252 --> 41:54.708
Here you go.

41:54.708 --> 41:55.540
Thank you.

41:56.584 --> 41:58.624
- No, no sorry.

41:58.624 --> 41:59.792
No one.

41:59.792 --> 42:02.876
- Yeah uh, just a
couple of old boxes.

42:02.876 --> 42:03.708
- Yeah.

42:04.876 --> 42:06.752
Looks like Fritz
was all on his own.

42:06.752 --> 42:08.832
- Well, that's good yes?

42:08.832 --> 42:09.668
- Yeah.

42:10.876 --> 42:13.000
Except we still don't know why.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.084
- Oh, well first thing's first.

42:14.084 --> 42:17.084
I need to get
Alexander to a sickbay.

42:34.252 --> 42:36.040
Mya, stop dawdling, hm?

42:42.124 --> 42:45.752
Once I get that bullet out
you'll need just a few stitches.

42:45.752 --> 42:47.416
- What I need is a drink.

42:47.416 --> 42:48.916
- You and me both.

42:51.876 --> 42:53.168
- Ought to take the sting off.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.708
- Did you see where Gerard went?

43:00.708 --> 43:01.540
- Screw him.

43:01.540 --> 43:02.876
He's a deserter.

43:03.876 --> 43:06.040
- Wouldn't want
us to look for you?

43:06.040 --> 43:08.252
- I wouldn't go runnin'
off in the first place.

43:09.084 --> 43:10.708
- I'm gonna head back to
the captain's quarters.

43:10.708 --> 43:13.540
I'll keep an eye
out for Faraday.

43:13.540 --> 43:15.960
Got one left, if you need it.

43:18.752 --> 43:20.084
Come on Bigelow.

43:24.460 --> 43:27.208
- I never liked these things.

44:05.124 --> 44:08.332
Now, this may sting a little.

44:23.332 --> 44:24.376
- You think that
buckle head down there

44:24.376 --> 44:26.332
just locked himself in there

44:26.332 --> 44:28.208
just to get away
from his captain?

44:28.208 --> 44:29.040
- Don't know.

44:33.584 --> 44:37.832
- You know, I heard flyboys
talkin' about gremlins

44:40.124 --> 44:43.832
causing all kinds of
trouble for the aircrafts.

44:43.832 --> 44:46.376
It's givin' me the heebie
jeebies just thinkin' about it.

44:46.376 --> 44:47.960
- Gremlins?

44:47.960 --> 44:49.376
- Yeah, gremlins.

45:05.332 --> 45:06.332
- There you go.

45:06.332 --> 45:07.416
That's the worst part over.

45:09.040 --> 45:12.084
- You know, whatever
happened on this ship,

45:12.084 --> 45:14.168
it wasn't gremlins.

45:14.168 --> 45:16.876
It was somethin' far more real.

45:16.876 --> 45:18.584
And ever strange.

45:19.416 --> 45:20.584
- Please, please, please.

45:21.668 --> 45:23.832
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

45:31.668 --> 45:32.832
- Man look.

45:32.832 --> 45:34.000
Fritz from downstairs.

45:40.708 --> 45:43.124
I've seen this before.

45:43.124 --> 45:44.916
What's this insignia?

45:44.916 --> 45:48.252
- That's some Nazi
voodoo shit right there.

45:51.292 --> 45:53.084
That thing's huge.

45:53.084 --> 45:53.960
What is that?

45:53.960 --> 45:56.000
That some kind of safe?

45:56.000 --> 45:57.460
- These bastards were makin' off

45:57.460 --> 46:01.624
with a fortune and
artwork and artefacts.

46:01.624 --> 46:02.960
- Maybe that was in
those crates downstairs.

46:02.960 --> 46:05.124
Maybe that was...

46:05.124 --> 46:07.624
Maybe there's gold and jewels.

46:10.540 --> 46:13.208
Yeah, nice little Nazi nest egg.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.040
Seemed like it.

46:38.792 --> 46:41.832
- Do you think her family's
here on this vessel?

46:41.832 --> 46:43.084
- I don't know.

46:44.040 --> 46:45.000
If there's one thing this war's

46:45.000 --> 46:47.168
good for it's making orphans.

46:52.960 --> 46:54.124
- Surely?

46:54.124 --> 46:55.708
Wait.

46:55.708 --> 46:56.540
Yes.

46:57.416 --> 46:58.252
Yes.

47:03.252 --> 47:04.084
Come on.

47:04.084 --> 47:04.916
Come on.

47:04.916 --> 47:06.540
Come on.

47:06.540 --> 47:07.416
Mayday.

47:07.416 --> 47:08.540
Mayday.

47:08.540 --> 47:09.668
Can anyone hear me?

47:11.876 --> 47:13.624
Is anybody there?

47:13.624 --> 47:14.584
Mayday.

47:16.708 --> 47:19.416
You said
you had a family?

47:19.416 --> 47:20.252
- Yeah.

47:22.292 --> 47:25.292
The Nazis, they
come for my village.

47:28.876 --> 47:31.292
They shoot the old, the weak.

47:34.624 --> 47:37.708
They killed my
father in front of me.

47:39.916 --> 47:42.832
They uh, take my
mother and sister.

47:46.460 --> 47:49.792
I knew I would not
be seeing them again.

47:55.084 --> 47:55.916
- I'm so sorry.

48:03.752 --> 48:04.584
All done.

48:10.416 --> 48:12.752
Let's see how this is going.

48:16.376 --> 48:17.708
- Your daughter?

48:19.916 --> 48:20.752
How old was she?

48:32.584 --> 48:36.500
- She would've been 12
this year but the blitz.

48:43.540 --> 48:47.040
It's impossible not
to be reminded of her.

48:49.124 --> 48:50.252
You know, part of me's scared of

48:50.252 --> 48:52.916
this war ending
because then I'll go home.

48:59.124 --> 49:02.332
And she won't be
there waiting for me.

49:02.332 --> 49:05.000
My husband, he's lost in Africa.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.584
I know he won't be coming back.

49:12.460 --> 49:13.792
This bloody war,

49:17.000 --> 49:20.752
takes everything from
you, gives you nothing back.

49:24.708 --> 49:26.624
- What were they up to?

49:33.084 --> 49:34.668
What the hell is this?

49:40.708 --> 49:42.208
Hey Bigelow, look.

49:48.376 --> 49:49.208
Oi?

49:53.376 --> 49:54.208
Bigelow?

50:02.960 --> 50:07.500
- Sorry Mr. Jackson but to
the victor go the spoils.

50:12.292 --> 50:13.668
Oh.

50:13.668 --> 50:20.832
Lady luck, you are
one beautiful minx.

50:51.668 --> 50:52.876
I hustled my way out of a war

50:52.876 --> 50:55.208
and I'm still gonna
come out on top.

51:30.792 --> 51:31.584
- Bigelow?

51:52.876 --> 51:53.708
Bigelow?

52:01.668 --> 52:02.500
- Get fucked.

52:11.124 --> 52:11.960
Bigelow!

52:47.916 --> 52:50.208
- Yes Mya, we'll keep
looking I promise you.

53:12.668 --> 53:14.292
Mya?

53:43.252 --> 53:44.084
- Miss Prescott?

53:48.040 --> 53:49.208
Hey, hey, hey.

53:52.624 --> 53:53.460
You okay?

53:57.000 --> 53:58.208
- Mya, she--

53:58.208 --> 53:59.040
Hey?

53:59.040 --> 54:00.416
- She...

54:00.416 --> 54:01.252
- I know.

54:05.332 --> 54:07.332
I need to show you somethin'.

54:08.540 --> 54:10.084
- Mayday.

54:10.084 --> 54:11.000
Um, mayday.

54:12.460 --> 54:13.832
Can anyone hear me?

54:17.124 --> 54:18.332
Mayday.

54:23.084 --> 54:26.040
Yes, yes, yes I can hear you.

54:30.124 --> 54:32.332
- Um, English, English.

54:32.332 --> 54:33.168
Uh...

54:35.460 --> 54:38.208
Speak the English better.

54:38.208 --> 54:39.040
English?

54:39.040 --> 54:39.876
- Yes.

54:40.752 --> 54:41.584
Yes.

54:42.752 --> 54:43.752
I'm English.

54:46.792 --> 54:49.460
I'm, I'm on one of your vessels.

54:50.500 --> 54:52.832
Anyone else on board?

54:52.832 --> 54:54.416
- Everybody's dead.

54:55.624 --> 54:58.876
The captain went
mad I'm telling you.

54:58.876 --> 55:00.168
What is your position?

55:00.168 --> 55:01.084
- Oh, um...

55:08.208 --> 55:09.208
Somewhere...

55:10.500 --> 55:11.916
It's somewhere in
the North Atlantic.

55:11.916 --> 55:12.792
I don't know.

55:12.792 --> 55:14.792
I'm not a navigator.

55:25.832 --> 55:27.376
Come in English.

55:34.040 --> 55:36.376
- My name is Gerard Faraday,

55:38.040 --> 55:42.208
and I am a code breaker
with British Intelligence.

55:44.584 --> 55:47.332
If you help me,
if you rescue me,

55:49.792 --> 55:53.208
I can provide you
with vital information,

55:54.040 --> 55:55.832
classified information.

56:08.584 --> 56:12.752
Listen my name is Gerard--
- We will send help English.

56:12.752 --> 56:15.252
Stay on the radio.

56:16.084 --> 56:18.708
We will attempt to
triangulate your position.

56:18.708 --> 56:19.540
- Thank God.

57:45.708 --> 57:50.124
- My guess is uh, they
brought these caskets onboard.

57:51.124 --> 57:55.292
One of these things got
out, slaughtered the crew.

57:56.252 --> 57:58.540
Mya.

57:58.540 --> 58:01.960
- Yeah, she was the
only one on the ship.

58:03.168 --> 58:06.668
The captain must've figured
out what was goin' on.

58:06.668 --> 58:09.208
Killed as many as he could.

58:09.208 --> 58:12.252
Wrecked the life boats,
turned the ship off course.

58:42.916 --> 58:44.584
It's these monsters.

58:45.668 --> 58:48.000
This is what killed Bigelow.

58:48.960 --> 58:49.792
This ugly bastard.

58:49.792 --> 58:51.624
- Please, please.

58:56.332 --> 58:58.332
It's, it's not possible.

58:59.252 --> 59:00.084
Strigoi.

59:02.252 --> 59:03.084
- What?

59:03.916 --> 59:04.752
- Strigoi.

59:06.876 --> 59:08.540
Fairytales.

59:08.540 --> 59:10.540
Something my
grandfather used to tell us.

59:10.540 --> 59:13.124
- This isn't exactly
a fairytale Alexander.

59:18.084 --> 59:19.916
- Strigoi is the living dead.

59:19.916 --> 59:20.752
Shape shifters.

59:20.752 --> 59:24.084
They, they, they
move by night, hunting.

59:25.540 --> 59:28.460
Changing shape and appearance.

59:28.460 --> 59:32.040
They command armies of
animals and insects.

59:36.584 --> 59:40.000
That's what bedtime stories
to, to frighten children.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.208
- Alexander?

59:41.208 --> 59:42.416
Alex?

59:42.416 --> 59:43.708
Hey?

59:43.708 --> 59:44.540
Hey?

59:45.460 --> 59:48.292
Did these bedtime stories,

59:48.292 --> 59:51.460
did they tell you how
to kill the bastards?

59:52.752 --> 59:53.708
Yeah?

59:53.708 --> 59:54.540
Yeah?

59:54.540 --> 59:56.668
- These uh, holy weapons.

59:56.668 --> 59:58.084
Relics and stuff.

01:00:00.332 --> 01:00:04.752
- There's a box of this
stuff down in the cargo hold.

01:00:05.792 --> 01:00:10.540
It's locked in there with
the one that killed Bigelow.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.376
- Okay.

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:16.460
So, only little girl
we have to worry about.

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.624
- And Faraday.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.084
He's still out there on his own.

01:00:22.832 --> 01:00:24.960
- Let's hope he's as
smart as he thinks he is.

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.292
- Faraday?

01:02:41.084 --> 01:02:41.916
Faraday?

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:44.876
- Gerard?

01:02:50.668 --> 01:02:51.500
Gerard?

01:02:53.668 --> 01:02:55.332
- Faraday?

01:02:55.332 --> 01:02:56.168
- Gerard?

01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:58.540
- Hey?

01:02:58.540 --> 01:02:59.540
Gerard?

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.376
Gerard?

01:03:10.332 --> 01:03:11.168
- Gerard?

01:03:19.624 --> 01:03:21.960
- You know nothing of death.

01:03:55.752 --> 01:03:59.832
We must show you what it
means to embrace death.

01:03:59.832 --> 01:04:01.000
To welcome it,

01:04:02.584 --> 01:04:03.832
with open arms.

01:04:16.792 --> 01:04:21.376
- It is your nature to fear
what you do not understand.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.876
- Gerard, stop.

01:04:25.876 --> 01:04:27.168
- Faraday?

01:04:27.168 --> 01:04:28.960
- It is not Faraday.

01:04:32.376 --> 01:04:33.668
Strigoi.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:42.832
- Wait!

01:04:42.832 --> 01:04:43.668
Wait!

01:04:43.668 --> 01:04:44.500
Wait!

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:49.292
Wait.

01:04:50.752 --> 01:04:51.584
- Teplov.

01:05:21.832 --> 01:05:23.124
- Do it!

01:05:23.124 --> 01:05:23.960
Do it.

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.084
- You are already dead.

01:05:34.084 --> 01:05:36.584
You simply do not know it yet.

01:05:38.752 --> 01:05:39.584
- Do it!

01:05:48.084 --> 01:05:48.916
- Why?

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.168
- You stabbed me.

01:06:10.168 --> 01:06:11.832
- Just breathe Gerard, breathe.

01:06:14.292 --> 01:06:15.876
I'll get you to sickbay.

01:06:15.876 --> 01:06:17.584
You'll be right as rain.

01:06:22.876 --> 01:06:23.916
Where are we?

01:06:26.084 --> 01:06:28.332
- You're going home Gerard.

01:06:31.876 --> 01:06:33.584
- It's autumn there now.

01:06:49.668 --> 01:06:52.084
- You did what you had to do.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.540
What is this?

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.668
- It's a big fucker.

01:07:28.668 --> 01:07:32.084
- All of this because
of one little girl.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.708
What if this big one gets out?

01:07:37.708 --> 01:07:38.540
We
can't let it happen.

01:07:42.668 --> 01:07:44.084
- Let's end this.

01:07:46.916 --> 01:07:47.752
Mya?

01:07:50.624 --> 01:07:51.460
Mya?

01:07:59.292 --> 01:08:01.124
Mya, where are you?

01:09:31.207 --> 01:09:32.040
- Mommy?

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.540
- Milly?

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:38.207
- Mommy, I'm scared.

01:09:41.207 --> 01:09:42.376
Mommy, please?

01:09:43.416 --> 01:09:45.207
- That's my
daughter, that's her.

01:09:45.207 --> 01:09:47.916
- You can save me this time.

01:09:47.916 --> 01:09:48.752
- Milly?

01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:49.752
It's not her.

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:50.584
It's not her.

01:09:50.584 --> 01:09:53.167
- No!
- Mommy let me out please!

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:56.624
- Let me in!

01:09:56.624 --> 01:09:59.916
- You can save me this
time mommy, please!

01:09:59.916 --> 01:10:01.168
- Let go of me!

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.292
- It's not her!

01:10:03.292 --> 01:10:04.460
It's not your daughter.

01:10:08.376 --> 01:10:09.208
Do it.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:13.832
Do it!

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.460
- Miss Prescott?

01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:45.208
I'll meet you at the
captain's quarters.

01:11:45.208 --> 01:11:46.416
- Right, that'll do.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.252
Sinclair?

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:22.460
- Miss Prescott?

01:13:37.832 --> 01:13:38.708
Miss Prescott?

01:15:01.752 --> 01:15:02.584
- Strigoi.

01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:32.460
Nathan?

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:34.084
- Jane?

01:15:34.084 --> 01:15:34.916
- Nathan?

01:15:36.792 --> 01:15:38.084
I'm waiting for you.

01:15:42.624 --> 01:15:44.208
Come to me my darling.

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:53.916
I've been waiting so long.

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:54.752
So long.

01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:57.292
- Shelly?

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.460
- Come back to me husband.

01:16:03.584 --> 01:16:04.624
Come.

01:16:04.624 --> 01:16:05.708
Come back to me husband.

01:16:05.708 --> 01:16:06.540
Come.

01:16:09.668 --> 01:16:11.876
We'll be together again.

01:16:11.876 --> 01:16:13.584
We'll be together again.

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:29.168
- But that other fella?

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:31.252
I thought I lost you.

01:16:31.252 --> 01:16:32.708
- I'm right here.

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.500
- I've been waiting a long time.

01:16:39.792 --> 01:16:40.624
- Sinclair!

01:17:10.376 --> 01:17:11.208
Sinclair?

01:17:23.332 --> 01:17:24.500
- Wait for me.

01:17:28.416 --> 01:17:30.000
What are you doing?

01:17:32.332 --> 01:17:33.168
Why?

01:17:33.168 --> 01:17:34.000
Why?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.500
Why?

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.040
- They are not
so easy to kill, no?

01:18:22.708 --> 01:18:24.876
- Not so easy to kill, no.

01:18:29.168 --> 01:18:30.000
- You hurt?

01:18:32.832 --> 01:18:34.500
I've been through worse.

01:18:38.124 --> 01:18:40.000
Miss Prescott?

01:18:41.708 --> 01:18:42.540
Ship.

01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:44.708
- The flare.

01:18:44.708 --> 01:18:45.624
Teplov, again.

01:18:45.624 --> 01:18:46.460
Signal the ship.

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:49.000
- No, that was last one.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.084
What if it is German, hm?

01:18:52.376 --> 01:18:54.332
- Better for the Nazis.

01:18:54.332 --> 01:18:55.460
Piece of piss mate.

01:18:59.584 --> 01:19:00.416
Strigoi.

01:19:01.708 --> 01:19:05.000
We can't let the
Strigoi off the ship.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.668
We won't.

01:19:07.584 --> 01:19:09.668
- We gotta find Miss Prescott.

01:19:09.668 --> 01:19:13.960
- Find Miss Prescott,
signal ship, kill Strigoi.

01:19:17.668 --> 01:19:19.252
- What's your plan?

01:19:20.792 --> 01:19:22.124
- We blow it up.

01:19:23.376 --> 01:19:24.916
We blow up ship.

01:19:24.916 --> 01:19:26.792
- We find Miss Prescott.

01:19:26.792 --> 01:19:30.752
- Jackson, he said chain
reaction could blow up ship.

01:19:30.752 --> 01:19:32.416
We get to munitions room,

01:19:32.416 --> 01:19:35.668
we detonate shell,
blow up boiler, boom.

01:19:37.376 --> 01:19:38.668
- You're right, boom.

01:19:38.668 --> 01:19:39.500
- Yeah?

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.832
- You're as mad as a cut snake.

01:19:43.832 --> 01:19:45.292
- Piece of piss mate.

01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:37.208
- That looks promising.

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:45.376
Got another plan?

01:21:49.332 --> 01:21:50.332
- Open door.

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:55.416
- Teplov and
Sinclair: Kill Strigoi.

01:21:55.416 --> 01:22:00.416
- All right, well I've been
killin' monsters for years.

01:22:00.792 --> 01:22:02.376
A few more won't hurt.

01:22:05.624 --> 01:22:07.916
Can't promise you're not
gonna get anymore scars.

01:22:07.916 --> 01:22:11.332
- Yeah, more
scars, more stories.

01:22:11.332 --> 01:22:13.000
- That's the spirit.

01:22:17.084 --> 01:22:18.084
Wanna trade?

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:20.332
- No.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.124
- Hey.

01:23:30.584 --> 01:23:34.500
Now we know what happened
to the crew.

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:37.292
- And what we will happen to me.

01:23:37.292 --> 01:23:38.668
- What?

01:23:38.668 --> 01:23:41.208
- Bite marks like this.

01:23:41.208 --> 01:23:44.040
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, naw.

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:46.208
- I think when Strigoi attack,

01:23:46.208 --> 01:23:49.876
what doesn't kill you
makes you one of them.

01:23:51.792 --> 01:23:52.624
So--

01:23:52.624 --> 01:23:54.040
- So no, come on.
- No, no, no, no,

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.752
- Come on!
- no, no, no, no.

01:23:55.752 --> 01:23:57.832
You go all right?

01:23:57.832 --> 01:23:59.752
You find Miss Prescott.

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.540
I will set off explosion.

01:24:04.876 --> 01:24:05.708
- No, no.

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:06.540
- Yes.
- No.

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:07.376
- Yes.

01:24:08.416 --> 01:24:09.252
Please.

01:24:11.084 --> 01:24:11.916
- Mate.

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:18.708
- I hope you see
your wife again.

01:24:18.708 --> 01:24:19.540
No.

01:24:20.584 --> 01:24:21.708
I hope she's happy.

01:24:25.752 --> 01:24:27.252
You tell her baby,

01:24:29.668 --> 01:24:34.124
there are not so many
monsters in the world today,

01:24:34.124 --> 01:24:36.124
as there were yesterday.

01:24:37.624 --> 01:24:38.584
Okay?

01:24:38.584 --> 01:24:39.416
You tell her.

01:25:27.708 --> 01:25:28.916
- Whoa!

01:25:28.916 --> 01:25:29.752
Jane?

01:25:31.084 --> 01:25:33.292
Come on, come on, come on!

01:25:33.292 --> 01:25:34.708
- No, Nathan!
- Come on.

01:25:34.708 --> 01:25:35.540
What?

01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:36.376
- No.
- What?

01:25:36.376 --> 01:25:38.960
- Oh, are you all right?

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.040
- It's not my blood.

01:25:43.584 --> 01:25:45.332
Come on, come on, come on.

01:25:45.332 --> 01:25:46.960
- No, Nathan?

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.000
What?

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:48.832
What's wrong?

01:25:51.208 --> 01:25:52.040
Come on.

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.168
We're not beat yet.

01:25:53.168 --> 01:25:54.332
We ain't beat yet.

01:25:54.332 --> 01:25:55.668
Come on!

01:25:57.792 --> 01:25:58.832
We gotta find the ship.

01:25:58.832 --> 01:25:59.668
Come on.

01:26:06.252 --> 01:26:07.084
- Jane come on.

01:26:07.084 --> 01:26:09.292
Come on, Teplov's
gonna blow the ship.

01:26:09.292 --> 01:26:10.208
- What?
- Come on.

01:26:31.416 --> 01:26:32.624
We don't have time.

01:26:32.624 --> 01:26:33.460
Come on!

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:36.960
I can see it!

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.124
We have to jump.

01:26:53.124 --> 01:26:54.332
- No, I can't.

01:26:54.332 --> 01:26:55.792
We
don't have a choice.

01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:15.960
- You have to leave me.

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:17.168
- What are you talking about?

01:27:45.376 --> 01:27:46.208
- No!

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.540
- Miss Prescott?

01:28:31.252 --> 01:28:32.540
Miss Prescott?

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:33.708
Miss Prescott?

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.460
Miss?

01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:38.752
Look, look a ship!

01:28:38.752 --> 01:28:39.832
It's a ship.

01:28:39.832 --> 01:28:40.668
Miss Prescott?

01:28:40.668 --> 01:28:42.752
It's British.

01:28:42.752 --> 01:28:43.584
Hey, hey!

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:45.792
Hey!

01:28:50.376 --> 01:28:51.752
You okay?

01:29:47.168 --> 01:29:50.832
Let the
medic through.

01:29:50.832 --> 01:29:52.876
Stand aside
gentlemen, give her a hand.

01:29:52.876 --> 01:29:54.460
- There.
- Bring this there.

01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:56.168
- You're safe now Miss.

01:29:56.168 --> 01:29:59.752
Did anybody else
make it off alive?

01:29:59.752 --> 01:30:01.252
- No.

01:30:01.252 --> 01:30:02.084
Only me.

01:30:08.208 --> 01:30:09.540
This bloody war.
