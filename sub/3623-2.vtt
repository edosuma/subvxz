Never, Mr. B.

It was time to move on.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.132
So not the drama.

So in denial.

01:07.834 --> 01:09.601

01:09.703 --> 01:11.637
It's brave the way you
mask your Mankey pain.

01:11.639 --> 01:16.175

you'd be the bummed one.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.119
Aah! No, Stoppable!

20:22.121 --> 20:24.188
It's pronounced
"Stoppabale!"

20:26.124 --> 20:28.326
Men.
Oh, yeah!

20:32.297 --> 20:33.998
Unh!

20:34.433 --> 20:36.100
Find your own hiding place.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.835
Oh, right, like you call dibs.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.770
Well, I am now.
Dibs! Ha!

20:39.772 --> 20:41.272
Well, I'm calling double dibs.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.374
Aah. You've won this round

20:43.376 --> 20:45.142
with your superior dib calling.

20:45.144 --> 20:47.211
But that won't save us
from them.

20:47.213 --> 20:49.280
[Crash] Huh? Huh?

20:49.282 --> 20:50.114
[Growls]

20:50.116 --> 20:51.749
Aah!
Aah!

20:51.751 --> 20:54.819
[Techno music plays]

20:55.120 --> 20:57.188
Oh! Uh, 'sup, K.P.?

20:57.190 --> 21:00.291
Peace out. Come on,
it's me, Ron.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.226
Remember the good times?

21:02.228 --> 21:03.527
Aah! Unh!

21:03.529 --> 21:06.864
Aah! Ok! All right!
Leave me alone!

21:06.866 --> 21:07.564
I'll be good!

21:07.566 --> 21:09.767
But I know you're
in there somewhere!

21:09.769 --> 21:11.302
Aah! Ooh!

21:11.304 --> 21:12.770
[Roars]

21:12.772 --> 21:15.172
Aah! Shego! K.P., help!

21:15.174 --> 21:16.474
[Growls]

21:16.476 --> 21:18.142
K.P., help!

21:18.144 --> 21:19.277
Sidekick in trouble!

21:19.279 --> 21:21.112
Huh?
Aah!

21:21.114 --> 21:22.947
Oh, man, not now.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.516
Ron, I... I can't...

21:31.556 --> 21:33.457
Oh.

21:33.948 --> 21:34.559
Stoppable.

21:34.560 --> 21:39.830
Heh heh heh.
See, mmm, no pads.

21:40.399 --> 21:41.265
Unh!

21:41.267 --> 21:43.467
Still upset?

21:43.469 --> 21:45.369
So not the drama.

21:45.371 --> 21:46.937
So Kim Possible,

21:46.939 --> 21:48.205
you were lucky this time.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.274
You might wanna be careful.

21:50.276 --> 21:51.575
Ha! You threaten me?

21:51.577 --> 21:55.446
No, Shego's still got
major moodulator issues.

21:55.448 --> 21:56.947
Drakken!

21:56.949 --> 21:58.215
Mommy. Oh!

21:58.217 --> 22:00.217
Ooh!

22:00.219 --> 22:00.917
Aah! Aah!

22:00.919 --> 22:05.156
So I... I guess the crush and
everything was all moodulator, huh?

22:05.158 --> 22:08.159
Not everything.
There's still fireworks.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.328
Ya think so?

22:14.399 --> 22:18.002
Aah! Oh! Shego,
please, stop that!

22:18.004 --> 22:21.839
Oh ho! Oh! I'm sorry!
I'll make you dinner.
