00:04.538 --> 00:07.575
*

00:19.687 --> 00:22.723
* Love is a madness

00:22.756 --> 00:24.458
* I can't get away

00:24.492 --> 00:26.694
* It hurts me to love you
Hey!

00:26.727 --> 00:28.829
* And it hurts me to stay

00:28.862 --> 00:31.732
* This sweet sadness

00:31.765 --> 00:32.766
* Is this all I get?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.268
You messed with
the wrong guy.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.503
Get off me.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.071
No... move, man!

00:37.105 --> 00:40.674
(car alarm wailing)

00:40.708 --> 00:44.178
* Well, if I can't make you
love me *

00:44.212 --> 00:48.816
* And if I can't
make you pretend *

00:48.849 --> 00:53.754
* I know I can't make you
want me, baby *

00:53.787 --> 00:57.191
* Then there's nothing else
to recommend *

00:57.225 --> 01:00.828
* I guess it has to end.

01:00.861 --> 01:03.131
*

01:18.746 --> 01:22.150
The curse of building 913.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.852
And Everett
Harrington Wentworth.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.254
I never believe
urban legends,

01:26.287 --> 01:28.656
but this one
I'm buying.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.391
Our vic is the
37th bizarre death

01:30.424 --> 01:31.759
connected to this
address since

01:31.792 --> 01:34.562
Wentworth himself jumped
from the penthouse in 1929.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.398
They say the building was
cursed on that very day.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.700
Wentworth lost
all his money

01:39.733 --> 01:41.535
in the crash
of the market.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.537
Distraught,
he leapt to his death.

01:43.571 --> 01:46.340
His beloved girlfriend,
Wilma Ashton--

01:46.374 --> 01:49.843
a stunning blonde--
watched his fatal leap,

01:49.877 --> 01:50.911
then killed herself.

01:50.944 --> 01:54.482
She was found lying in a pool
of her own blood.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.217
Many believe their ghosts

01:56.250 --> 01:58.652
roam the floors.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.588
Anything paranormal,
or otherwise, upstairs?

02:00.621 --> 02:02.156
I had a couple unis look around

02:02.190 --> 02:05.159
for a beautiful blonde,
but no luck.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.160
The penthouse apartment is used

02:06.194 --> 02:07.161
as a haunted tourist attraction
during the day,

02:07.195 --> 02:08.295
and a club at night.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.798
It closes
around 2:00 a.m.,

02:10.830 --> 02:12.733
employees finish locking up
about 3:00, 3:30.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.703
Hey, Sid, how come
they only ever call you out

02:15.736 --> 02:17.171
to the really strange ones?

02:17.205 --> 02:18.872
They... didn't call me.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.809
Uh, this is one
I was not going to miss.

02:22.976 --> 02:23.944
Witnesses on the ground report

02:23.977 --> 02:25.613
that our vic fell from above.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.381
The heard a roar,
looked up,

02:27.415 --> 02:28.849
saw him mid-plunge.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.918
This cabdriver parked here
to get a cup of coffee.

02:30.951 --> 02:31.985
Luckily, he missed
all the excitement.

02:32.019 --> 02:34.855
No idea where exactly our
victim was when he fell?

02:34.888 --> 02:36.224
No, but I'm collecting
surveillance

02:36.257 --> 02:37.458
from all the cameras
in the vicinity

02:37.491 --> 02:38.792
and inside the building.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.597
1920s attire.

02:43.631 --> 02:46.600
A leather mask.

02:46.634 --> 02:50.371
In tribute, uh, Wentworth
was the Gatsby of his time.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.873
Uh, made his fortune
in leather goods.

02:52.906 --> 02:55.609
He was scarred
from a disease.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.611
Allergy to the sun,
I believe.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.280
Covered his face with
intricately-designed

02:59.313 --> 03:00.714
leather masks.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.784
So our victim was fascinated

03:03.817 --> 03:05.719
with Wentworth's story
and decided to commit suicide

03:05.753 --> 03:08.789
the exact same way?

03:08.822 --> 03:10.591
Or, he was drunk
at the steam punk party,

03:10.624 --> 03:11.925
decided he needed
some fresh air,

03:11.959 --> 03:15.229
woops, accident, not a suicide?

03:15.263 --> 03:18.966
I've already
eliminated both those options.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.934
It's murder.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.936
Laceration of the
carotid artery.

03:22.970 --> 03:26.006
And, no protruding
glass or metal

03:26.039 --> 03:27.875
to suggest it happened
from the impact.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.944
And I wouldn't give up
your search for that

03:30.978 --> 03:33.447
beautiful blonde, Flack.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.015
Lipstick kiss.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.884
TAYLOR:
My guess is she's
alive and well.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.554
And could be our killer.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.659
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

04:02.343 --> 04:06.714
* Out here in the fields

04:06.747 --> 04:10.618
* I fight for my meals

04:10.651 --> 04:15.022
* I get my back into my living

04:17.625 --> 04:19.726
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.503
(camera shutter clicking)

04:51.392 --> 04:53.661
Well, uh,
blunt force trauma resulting

04:53.694 --> 04:56.930
in a fissure fracture
of the skull,

04:56.964 --> 04:59.066
and possibly
the fracture of

04:59.099 --> 05:00.434
every other bone
in his body.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.803
Is there any evidence
that our killer

05:02.836 --> 05:04.372
pushed him after
he stabbed him?

05:04.405 --> 05:05.806
Well, with the victim
in this condition,

05:05.839 --> 05:07.408
it'll be difficult
to tell if there

05:07.441 --> 05:10.911
was any kind of a... struggle.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.480
What? What is it?

05:12.513 --> 05:15.383
Well, (sighs) look at his face.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.751
He doesn't look like
he fought the fall.

05:17.785 --> 05:20.388
He could've
been disoriented

05:20.421 --> 05:22.423
as a result of the stabbing,

05:22.456 --> 05:23.524
lost consciousness,

05:23.557 --> 05:24.758
then, he just fell.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.727
You can tell all that
by just looking at him?

05:26.760 --> 05:28.496
Well, it's not
based on any

05:28.529 --> 05:30.564
published scientific
research,

05:30.598 --> 05:32.400
just something over the years
that I've learned to see

05:32.433 --> 05:35.403
in the victims that have
been on my autopsy table.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.606
Reminds me of
Evelyn McHale.

05:38.639 --> 05:41.475
She was only
23 years old.

05:41.509 --> 05:44.378
In 1947, she jumped
to her death

05:44.412 --> 05:47.548
from the observation deck of
the Empire State Building.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.583
Landed on top of
a limousine.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.151
She was clutching
her pearl necklace

05:51.184 --> 05:52.486
when they found her.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.854
Oh, is that that famous picture

05:53.887 --> 05:55.623
from Life magazine?

05:55.656 --> 05:59.460
Yes, uh, they called it "the
most beautiful suicide."

05:59.493 --> 06:03.030
In the photo, she
looked so peaceful.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.499
Lindsay,
are you okay?

06:05.533 --> 06:06.667
Why?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.469
You just look
a little piqued.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.771
No, I'm fine.
Hm.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.974
I got a little,
uh, info on our vic.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.108
He dresses as Everett Wentworth

06:15.142 --> 06:16.544
and takes pictures
with the tourists

06:16.577 --> 06:17.545
and the club patrons.

06:18.646 --> 06:19.880
Anybody want to come in?
Anybody?

06:19.913 --> 06:21.014
Anybody? You guys?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.616
Hey, come on in.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.051
How are you guys doing?

06:24.084 --> 06:26.520
Ready?

06:26.554 --> 06:28.021
Great, thank you.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.923
Hey, hey, hey.
Hi.

06:29.957 --> 06:30.924
Take a pic with me.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.392
Hey, one more.
Ready?

06:33.727 --> 06:36.497
LINDSAY:
Well, that could explain the
lipstick on his cheek.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.498
He got a name?

06:37.531 --> 06:39.600
That seems to be the hard part.

06:39.633 --> 06:42.636
Guys at the security desk
know him as Jason-- just Jason--

06:42.670 --> 06:44.071
so they sent
me upstairs

06:44.104 --> 06:46.106
to the folks who run the
tours and nightclub,

06:46.139 --> 06:48.676
and they know him
as Jake, no last name.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.010
And, until ten
minutes ago,

06:50.043 --> 06:51.645
everybody thought he worked
for the building.

06:51.679 --> 06:52.713
So, we got nothing.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.583
We got no paperwork,
no background info, no permit.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.917
No identity.

06:56.950 --> 07:01.221
So our Everett Wentworth
is a John Doe.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.457
*

07:05.526 --> 07:09.129
* I ran from the tide

07:09.162 --> 07:15.035
* Won't let you hide,
won't let you hide *

07:15.068 --> 07:18.205
* I drop beats
from this processed meat *

07:18.238 --> 07:23.544
* For a conversation,
a meditation and *

07:23.577 --> 07:27.615
* I cut waves
like some unborn sage *

07:27.648 --> 07:32.686
* Just like terrorists
on a day of rest singing *

07:32.720 --> 07:35.989
* I ran from the tide

07:36.023 --> 07:41.829
* Won't let you hide,
won't let you hide *

07:41.862 --> 07:45.599
* I break bones
stealing mobile phones *

07:45.633 --> 07:49.737
* And I'm cuttin' deals
for these homeless meals *

07:49.770 --> 07:54.274
* Making idle threats
using Chinese burns *

07:54.307 --> 07:59.513
* As you load my head with
the Grateful Dead singing *

07:59.547 --> 08:02.883
* I ran from the tide

08:02.916 --> 08:08.622
* Won't let you hide,
won't let you hide. *

08:08.656 --> 08:10.658
*

08:19.833 --> 08:21.835
(trilling)

08:27.908 --> 08:30.878
Anything on the prints
from Sid's ten card, Adam?

08:30.911 --> 08:32.813
No hits in AFIS.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.782
The vic is still
a John Doe.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.683
TAYLOR:
What's all this?

08:36.717 --> 08:39.219
Ah, this stuff
was found inside

08:39.251 --> 08:41.922
the hidden pocket
on the vic's jacket.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.592
Our vic was a pickpocket.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.660
ROSS:
Loser.

08:46.694 --> 08:47.861
Look, I-I-I I'm sorry,
that's inappropriate

08:47.895 --> 08:49.797
and unprofessional; I'm not
supposed to have an opinion,

08:49.830 --> 08:50.964
but, that guy was out there
taking pictures

08:50.998 --> 08:52.232
with tourists,
innocent tourists,

08:52.265 --> 08:53.701
while he was stealing from them.

08:53.734 --> 08:54.367
Pictures, pictures.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.136
You two want to take a pic?

08:56.169 --> 08:57.571
Yeah.
All right.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.907
Ready?

08:59.940 --> 09:01.041
Good? One, two, three.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.109
(camera shutter clicks)

09:03.110 --> 09:03.944
Thank you. See you, guys.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.680
Bye.
Thanks.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.782
Wallets, watches,
jewelry, phones.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.818
Loser, okay?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.285
And he was getting
away with it.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.987
Or maybe not.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.323
Maybe that's what
got him killed, Adam.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.891
Turn on all these phones,

09:17.925 --> 09:20.027
track them to
their owners.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.662
Cross-reference
any info you get

09:21.695 --> 09:23.063
with registered
guests in hotels.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.933
See if any of the jewelry or
watches have serial numbers.

09:25.966 --> 09:26.867
Look for I.D.'s in the wallets.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.003
Check to see if anything
was reported stolen.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.305
As of right now, every one
of these people is a suspect.

09:32.339 --> 09:33.941
(phone chimes)

09:33.974 --> 09:36.276
And start with whoever
owns this phone.

09:36.309 --> 09:40.013
I want a name and address
as soon as possible.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.691
I'm here to pick up
shirts for my son.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.661
It's under Jo Danville.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.195
Thank you.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.855
DANVILLE:
Those are a little bright.

10:21.889 --> 10:25.158
Are you trying
to stop traffic?

10:25.192 --> 10:27.995
You're right, I should just
go with something safe.

10:28.028 --> 10:31.899
Well, you should
always try it on first.

10:31.932 --> 10:36.036
Make sure it looks
good with your eyes.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.671
Why are you following me?

10:37.705 --> 10:38.872
(clears throat)

10:38.906 --> 10:42.009
Uh, I'm not following you.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.377
You were at the coffee shop
15 minutes ago.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.013
You ordered herbal tea,
completely gave you away.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.114
15 minutes before that,

10:47.147 --> 10:50.050
you were at a bus stop
right in front of my apartment.

10:50.083 --> 10:55.088
Um, pleasant coincidence?

10:55.122 --> 10:57.124
No. What's your name?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.893
Grant.
Grant Holliston.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.062
I suppose any
other woman my age

11:02.095 --> 11:05.098
would be flattered,
assuming that she's got

11:05.132 --> 11:07.100
the attention of a very
attractive younger man.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.302
But I'm a little
bit smarter than that.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.239
You should know that I am
a first-grade detective,

11:12.272 --> 11:15.709
a sworn federal marshal,
former FBI agent,

11:15.743 --> 11:17.077
which makes me
highly suspicious

11:17.110 --> 11:18.411
and acutely observant.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.047
So, once again,
you want to tell me why

11:20.080 --> 11:21.348
you're following me?

11:21.381 --> 11:25.018
Um... I'm not sure what to say.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.054
I'm carrying a gun.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.756
All right.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.091
I'll tell you if we
can go someplace quiet.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.893
But public.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.361
And you promise
not to shoot me.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.964
Deal.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.002
HAWKES:
Looks like our vic fractured

11:42.035 --> 11:43.136
every bone
in his body.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.204
Ah. Uh...

11:44.237 --> 11:46.106
Thoracic and
pelvic injuries

11:46.139 --> 11:47.274
suggest that
our victim fell

11:47.307 --> 11:49.476
from a distance
of more than

11:49.509 --> 11:51.478
18 meters,
but less than 30.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.981
That's somewhere between
the sixth and tenth

11:54.014 --> 11:55.282
floors of
the building.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.317
Was he dead before the fall?
He was dead

11:57.350 --> 11:58.852
before the impact.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.921
He drowned, so to speak.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.055
Blood from the
lacerated artery

12:02.089 --> 12:03.190
flooded his lungs
on the flight down.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.524
Exactly.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.525
I collected trace

12:05.558 --> 12:08.061
from the
neck wound.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.129
A powdery black substance.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.835
And several black flecks.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.971
Hopefully, analysis

12:18.005 --> 12:18.939
of these will
get us somewhere,

12:18.972 --> 12:22.109
along with trace I collected
from the clothing.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.944
The wound track
help determine

12:23.977 --> 12:25.178
the type of
knife used?

12:25.212 --> 12:27.347
It was very odd.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.149
No hilt mark was evident,

12:29.182 --> 12:30.984
and the tissue
is jagged

12:31.018 --> 12:32.786
at the surface
as well as

12:32.820 --> 12:34.021
within the wound.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.488
Suggests the murder weapon
has an uneven blade,

12:35.522 --> 12:37.057
if it has a
blade at all.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.260
And that wasn't
my only discovery.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.863
This was in the victim's mouth.

12:47.467 --> 12:50.237
It looks like
a page of newspaper.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.306
A message from the killer?

12:53.340 --> 12:55.909
(siren wailing,
indistinct radio transmission)

12:57.477 --> 13:01.214
"I know it's you,
I'm coming after you"?

13:01.248 --> 13:02.382
This is your phone, right?

13:02.415 --> 13:04.517
Well... yeah.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.053
I threatened him,
but I wanted to send

13:06.086 --> 13:07.254
a clear message
to whoever it was

13:07.287 --> 13:09.189
that stole it,
that I wanted it back.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.523
Where were you last night,
Calvin,

13:10.557 --> 13:11.959
around 1:00 in the morning?

13:11.992 --> 13:13.360
I can't remember.
Really?

13:13.393 --> 13:15.128
You know,
uh...

13:15.162 --> 13:18.131
where this surveillance
footage was taken?

13:18.165 --> 13:19.833
No, I don't.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.134
Do you know what elevator
that is?

13:21.168 --> 13:23.003
I'm guessing the elevator
in my hotel.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.204
That's a bad guess.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.839
This is surveillance
footage of your mug

13:25.873 --> 13:27.474
heading up the elevator
to a nightclub

13:27.507 --> 13:29.376
at Building 913.
LOVATO: Around 1:00 a.m.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.011
Were you looking for revenge?

13:31.044 --> 13:32.445
No, I was...

13:32.479 --> 13:34.247
I was looking for a girl.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.015
All right?
I met her

13:35.048 --> 13:36.483
a couple nights ago,
we hit it off,

13:36.516 --> 13:38.085
we agreed to meet at the club.

13:38.118 --> 13:38.886
Only I didn't have

13:38.919 --> 13:41.221
my phone to find out
she stood me up.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.223
Okay? Yeah, I was
a little pissed,

13:43.256 --> 13:44.491
and I sent that message.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.027
But what law is there that says
a guy can't be a little peeved?

13:47.060 --> 13:49.196
Did he just say "peeved"?
Peeved.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.631
That little masked man

13:51.664 --> 13:53.200
was pestering me on the street

13:53.233 --> 13:54.434
and it really ticked me off.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.169
It's got to be
when he took my phone.

13:56.203 --> 13:57.437
And what'd you
do about it?

13:57.470 --> 13:59.306
Nothing.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.573
You know what, Calvin?

14:00.607 --> 14:02.509
You've got to tune into
a couple cop shows.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.610
These days, there's
surveillance cameras

14:03.643 --> 14:04.912
all over the city.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.413
Take a look
at that.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.184
Hey.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.320
Hey, man, get back.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.288
Hey, hey, what
are you doing?

14:17.190 --> 14:18.458
Just go.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.231
I can't
believe this.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.299
Okay. Yeah.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.668
I got mad, but
I didn't kill nobody.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.071
There's only one problem,
Calvin.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.505
We have
a dead guy.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.341
And we have footage of you going
up that elevator,

14:34.374 --> 14:35.508
but not down.
I took the stairs.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.910
There were too many people

14:36.944 --> 14:38.145
waiting in line,
it would've taken forever.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.547
You took the
stairs 94 floors?

14:40.580 --> 14:42.449
Burned off the
booze, man.
Wow.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.951
You're in shape, huh?

14:43.984 --> 14:45.485
Got anybody who can
back that story up?

14:45.518 --> 14:46.686
Look...

14:46.719 --> 14:48.588
I came to New York
to have a good time.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.590
Okay? I leave tomorrow.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.059
I have no phone,

14:52.092 --> 14:54.327
my hotel stinks, and
I didn't have any fun,

14:54.361 --> 14:55.996
if you know
what I mean.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.430
Besides, like
I said before,

14:57.464 --> 14:59.399
I didn't kill nobody.

14:59.432 --> 15:02.302
It's very clear to me
that I'm the victim here.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.724
I've been trying to meet you
for a long time.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.926
DANVILLE:
That part's accomplished.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.332
I don't really even know
where to start.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.367
Beginning, I guess.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.637
I was born in Tuscaloosa,
Alabama.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.306
Roll Tide!

15:39.339 --> 15:42.075
I'm from Alabama.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.978
I went to undergrad
in Tuscaloosa.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.479
But you know that,
don't you?

15:48.415 --> 15:50.483
Did we meet before?
No.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.387
Do we have mutual friends?

15:54.421 --> 15:56.056
No.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.091
Not exactly.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.031
Eight years ago,
I was diagnosed with

16:04.064 --> 16:05.165
a heart disease

16:05.198 --> 16:07.734
called hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.

16:07.767 --> 16:11.138
Um, it was very hard
for my heart to pump blood

16:11.171 --> 16:12.739
and I was extremely sick.

16:12.772 --> 16:16.176
Well, you look very healthy now.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.511
That's because three years
after my condition

16:18.545 --> 16:20.347
was discovered,

16:20.380 --> 16:22.482
on September 13,

16:22.515 --> 16:25.252
I was given a donor heart.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.386
A very successful

16:26.419 --> 16:28.455
transplant.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.589
An incredible match,

16:29.622 --> 16:31.624
and a healthy donor.

16:39.766 --> 16:40.767
That was you?

16:41.734 --> 16:43.403
Yes.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.178
You got her heart?

16:51.211 --> 16:53.213
Yes.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.616
And I've been trying
to find out who she was,

16:56.649 --> 16:58.185
and what she was like.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.587
(sighs)

17:00.620 --> 17:04.290
I didn't mean to
follow you today.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.226
Your office said
you weren't in,

17:06.259 --> 17:07.760
and you were coming out
of your apartment, I...

17:09.762 --> 17:11.164
(sighs)

17:11.198 --> 17:13.233
...didn't exactly know
how to approach you.

17:13.266 --> 17:16.435
Just... trying to get up
the nerve, I guess.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.207
And now I'm hoping
I haven't made

17:20.240 --> 17:24.042
a big, giant
selfish mistake.

17:25.244 --> 17:27.714
You have my sister's heart.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.522
Whoa.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.528
(choked up):
I'm sorry.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.544
*

18:14.761 --> 18:16.796
Is it hot in here?

18:16.829 --> 18:18.465
It's like the vent's not blowing
or something.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.632
I mean,
it's warm in here, right?

18:19.666 --> 18:21.601
Mm-mm.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.204
Really?

18:25.838 --> 18:28.275
* I was towing the line

18:28.308 --> 18:31.444
* Looking for a little remedy

18:31.478 --> 18:33.546
* Just a matter of time

18:33.580 --> 18:36.583
* Till your hands
were healing me *

18:36.616 --> 18:42.389
* Yoo-hoo, you wanted to look
the devil right in the eye *

18:42.422 --> 18:45.492
* Yoo-hoo, you wanted to

18:45.525 --> 18:48.595
* Now I'm paying for it
with my life *

18:48.628 --> 18:54.701
* Ooh, ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh *

18:54.734 --> 18:57.604
* Now that I'm a hungry
and looking around *

18:57.637 --> 19:00.740
* All this loving on the run
got me falling down *

19:00.773 --> 19:02.875
* Climbing up the walls, boy,
you're coming down *

19:02.909 --> 19:07.780
* All this loving on the run
got me spinning round, round *

19:10.883 --> 19:12.919
* I was lining it up

19:12.952 --> 19:15.622
* We were out there
shooting the breeze *

19:15.655 --> 19:21.728
* Just a hat and a coat,
and a pocketful of dreams *

19:21.761 --> 19:27.567
* Yoo-hoo, you wanted to look
the devil right in the eye *

19:27.600 --> 19:30.403
* Yoo-hoo, you wanted to

19:30.437 --> 19:34.374
* Now I'm paying for it
with my life *

19:34.407 --> 19:39.479
* Ooh, ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh *

19:39.512 --> 19:42.415
* Now that I'm a hungry
and looking around *

19:42.449 --> 19:44.951
* All this loving on the run
got me falling down *

19:44.984 --> 19:48.355
* Climbing up the walls, boy,
you're coming down *

19:48.388 --> 19:49.789
* All this loving on the run
got me spinning round, round. *

19:49.822 --> 19:52.525
Sequins.

19:52.559 --> 19:55.194
*

20:04.737 --> 20:06.606
We gotta check
every floor?

20:06.639 --> 20:08.475
No, no.
We're not gonna

20:08.508 --> 20:10.410
check every floor.
If you'd do your homework

20:10.443 --> 20:12.545
and read the
reports, Adam,

20:12.579 --> 20:14.747
Sid's autopsy suggests
that our vic fell

20:14.781 --> 20:16.716
somewhere between the
sixth and tenth floors.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.585
You didn't read
Sid's autopsy.
Nah, I didn't
read it.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.253
But Mac filled me in.

20:20.287 --> 20:21.921
(laughs)
That's how
I do it.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.590
Let's go.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.732
DANNY:
Looks like this floor's
the one.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.736
Blood on the glass.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.237
On the wall here.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.008
This could be our
primary crime scene.

21:05.465 --> 21:06.566
How tall's our vic?

21:06.599 --> 21:08.701
Five-11,
five-ten.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.538
There's a void here.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.040
All right. The arterial spray

21:14.073 --> 21:16.576
suggests that the attacker
was facing him.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.678
The attacker slices his throat,

21:18.711 --> 21:21.614
blood spatter goes
all over the killer,

21:21.648 --> 21:23.350
on the back of the door.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.618
And the void suggests
that the attacker

21:25.652 --> 21:27.587
and the vic are roughly
the same height.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.857
So the stabbing
happened here.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.792
The blood trail indicates

21:32.825 --> 21:35.061
that our victim moved
in this direction.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.830
Then he staggered over
to the edge, and...

21:37.864 --> 21:39.332
yeow...

21:39.366 --> 21:40.266
I know.

21:40.299 --> 21:44.471
I mean, but the blood pool
is right here.

21:44.504 --> 21:45.472
So he dropped here.

21:45.505 --> 21:46.739
Nowhere near the edge.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.575
I've got partial
footprints

21:48.608 --> 21:50.710
all the way to the door
from the blood pool.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.345
They're not
our vic's.

21:52.379 --> 21:53.746
So they got to
be our killer's.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.748
But why would the killer
come all the way back here

21:55.782 --> 21:56.916
after he
stabbed him?

21:56.949 --> 21:58.751
He wanted to make
sure he's dead.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.687
DANNY:
Or...

22:00.720 --> 22:03.456
(man whimpering)
he wanted to leave a message.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.858
(whimpers, gags)

22:05.892 --> 22:08.528
The vic tried to
stay alive, Adam.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.730
He got to his feet.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.068
ROSS:
He had no idea
he was close to the edge.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.004
(gasping)

22:18.037 --> 22:20.807
(man screaming)

22:20.840 --> 22:23.710
That's no way to go.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.852
GRANT:
Hey, Jo.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.890
You left your bag at the café.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.126
Thank you.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.733
I never stopped to think
about who got Leanne's heart.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.001
I was just so preoccupied
with my anger

22:49.035 --> 22:50.837
toward the guy that hit her.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.806
Drunk driver.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.742
It was raining.

22:55.775 --> 22:58.778
I was in Virginia
at the time.

22:58.811 --> 23:01.448
Then Mama called.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.550
WOMAN:
Jo?

23:03.583 --> 23:05.752
DANVILLE:
Mama, what is it?

23:05.785 --> 23:07.487
Jo, it's Leanne.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.855
You got to come home, honey.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.189
She's not gonna make it.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.460
Jo, you got to come home.

23:13.493 --> 23:16.763
She was gone before I even
made it out of my driveway.

23:18.765 --> 23:22.101
Wow, we were just
all so consumed with grief,

23:22.134 --> 23:25.572
and all the while your family,

23:25.605 --> 23:27.707
thrilled that Leanne
was a match.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.910
She saved my life.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.645
How did you find me?

23:32.679 --> 23:34.080
How did you know
I was her sister?

23:34.113 --> 23:35.982
How did you know
Leanne was your donor?

23:36.015 --> 23:38.851
I kind of put
two and two together.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.820
(sighs)

23:40.853 --> 23:42.789
A nurse said that
there was a car accident.

23:42.822 --> 23:46.125
The heart came
from a woman.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.827
I knew the date,

23:47.860 --> 23:49.662
September 13.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.731
It was even a Friday.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.967
And, uh, I knew how quickly

23:55.001 --> 23:56.803
they had to transport
the heart

23:56.836 --> 23:59.038
from the donor to the recipient.

23:59.071 --> 24:02.008
So you searched the newspapers,
looking for accidents.

24:02.041 --> 24:05.878
You must have known before now.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.580
I did.

24:07.614 --> 24:10.883
How do you walk up to someone
and say to them

24:10.917 --> 24:13.753
that you have the heart
of someone they lost,

24:13.786 --> 24:15.087
someone they loved?

24:16.923 --> 24:19.158
What do you do, Grant?

24:19.191 --> 24:21.127
I'm a professor.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.496
Joined the faculty
at Memphis University.

24:23.530 --> 24:24.931
I teach physics.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.634
Are you married?

24:27.667 --> 24:29.602
No.

24:29.636 --> 24:30.770
Got engaged once.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.672
I got cold feet.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.974
Leanne never married.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.276
Never even made it
to the church.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.178
Daddy was so mad;
he'd spent all his money.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.614
(chuckles)

24:41.648 --> 24:43.082
She was right.

24:43.115 --> 24:45.117
That guy was a creep.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.892
Are you a good man, Grant?

24:57.997 --> 25:00.733
I think so.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.236
When you woke up
from the transplant surgery,

25:04.270 --> 25:07.006
what was the first thing
that you remember?

25:12.712 --> 25:15.582
A bright warm light.

25:15.615 --> 25:19.085
And then a woman's smiling face.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.220
Your mama.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.289
No.

25:23.322 --> 25:26.659
It was a face
I didn't know,

25:26.693 --> 25:30.663
and now that I see you,

25:30.697 --> 25:34.066
I think it was your sister.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.837
(chuckles)

25:37.870 --> 25:39.872
Wow.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.667
TAYLOR:
Hey, are you okay?

26:07.700 --> 26:09.001
Who, me?

26:09.035 --> 26:10.737
Yeah, you.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.204
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

26:12.238 --> 26:14.240
You looked a little, um...

26:14.273 --> 26:16.375
Perplexed.
Well, that's not the word

26:16.408 --> 26:19.278
I was going to use, but...

26:19.311 --> 26:20.647
Well, the crumpled paper
that Sid found

26:20.680 --> 26:21.848
in the victim's mouth,

26:21.881 --> 26:24.684
it came
from the Chelsea Voice Weekly.

26:24.717 --> 26:27.219
So that's all I've got, uh,
but I'm hoping

26:27.253 --> 26:29.221
to make a connection
to our victim,

26:29.255 --> 26:31.223
that can lead us to our killer.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.260
So I probably
shouldn't be standing

26:34.293 --> 26:36.328
around here chatting with you,
you know what I mean?

26:36.362 --> 26:38.330
Okay. You need help?

26:38.364 --> 26:40.667
No. No.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.034
No.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.806
(dialing)

26:49.676 --> 26:51.243
Hey, you owe me ten bucks.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.779
I just saw Lindsay.

26:52.812 --> 26:55.047
No, she didn't say anything.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.649
I just know I'm right.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.685
I know I am.

26:58.718 --> 26:59.952
No, Christine,

26:59.986 --> 27:02.054
I'm not going
to come right out and ask her.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.256
What kind of proof?

27:04.290 --> 27:06.092
All right.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.761
I'll get you proof.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.363
We still on
for dinner tomorrow night?

27:11.397 --> 27:13.232
Great.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.234
I love you, too.

27:15.267 --> 27:18.170
Bye.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.679
You cooking something

27:26.713 --> 27:27.479
or should I say

27:27.513 --> 27:29.716
burning something in here,
Sheldon?

27:29.749 --> 27:32.719
What do you get
if you combine carbon, polymer,

27:32.752 --> 27:34.286
fatty acids and chicle?

27:34.320 --> 27:35.788
Let's see.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.156
Polymer is some kind of plastic.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.925
Fatty acids
could be almost anything,

27:38.958 --> 27:40.727
but based on the smell in here,

27:40.760 --> 27:43.329
I'm guessing it's
a kind of food.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.397
The carbon is
associated with fire,

27:45.431 --> 27:46.699
chicle is gum.

27:46.733 --> 27:47.834
We're gonna be here all day

27:47.867 --> 27:49.468
if I try guessing exactly
where you're headed here.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.038
It's our murder weapon.

27:53.873 --> 27:57.076
Plastic, fatty acids, and gum?

27:57.109 --> 27:58.377
That doesn't sound
too dangerous.

27:58.410 --> 27:59.578
Those were all components
that were detected

27:59.611 --> 28:01.914
in the trace Sid collected
from the victim's stab wound.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.449
Trace left by the knife.

28:03.482 --> 28:06.418
Which would suggest
the knife was man-made.

28:06.452 --> 28:08.254
Mm-hmm, and it was created

28:08.287 --> 28:12.058
by first using an AA battery

28:12.091 --> 28:14.994
and a foil gum wrapper.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.764
The creation of a spark.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.839
Ah, the gum wrapper
was the source of our chicle.

28:26.873 --> 28:29.175
(blows air)
You attach the foil side

28:29.208 --> 28:31.744
to the battery's positive
and negative charge

28:31.778 --> 28:33.913
at the same time,

28:33.946 --> 28:36.115
you get a spark
that starts a fire.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.116
Exactly.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.286
The question is
why would someone need

28:40.319 --> 28:41.821
to start a fire that way?

28:41.854 --> 28:43.089
Well, most likely someone

28:43.122 --> 28:45.291
who didn't have access
to matches or a lighter.

28:45.324 --> 28:48.527
Both easily accessible unless...

28:48.560 --> 28:49.996
You're in a prison cell.

28:50.029 --> 28:50.930
Yeah.

28:50.963 --> 28:53.032
The murder weapon
was a handmade shank.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.367
And I believe I know the recipe.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.870
A pile of corn chips

28:57.904 --> 28:59.772
represents the fatty acids.

28:59.806 --> 29:01.040
TAYLOR:
Start a spark,

29:01.073 --> 29:03.910
ignite a napkin
or toilet paper.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.946
The oils in the chip serve
as a slow burning fuel source.

29:06.979 --> 29:09.548
The burn is the carbon.

29:09.581 --> 29:13.019
The black soot trace found
in the wound.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.520
Polymer is a plastic.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.789
A plastic fork or toothbrush.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.190
In our case,

29:18.224 --> 29:20.860
the killer used
a coffee cup to-go lid.

29:20.893 --> 29:23.295
The black flecks Sid found
in the wound.

29:23.329 --> 29:26.198
HAWKES:
Molded over heat

29:26.232 --> 29:28.868
in the shape of the blade.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.470
TAYLOR:
Submerge it in water,

29:31.503 --> 29:32.805
it instantly hardens.

29:32.839 --> 29:34.974
File it down,
repeat the process

29:35.007 --> 29:36.575
and you have a murder weapon.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.978
All of these are items
that are accessible to inmates.

29:39.011 --> 29:41.080
Our killer is an ex-con.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.782
And hell-bent on revenge.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.297
Mac, I give up.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.465
I surrender.

29:59.498 --> 30:00.833
I have nowhere else to turn.

30:00.867 --> 30:02.935
What did Danny do now?

30:02.969 --> 30:04.971
No, this time it's work.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.973
The crumpled piece of paper
that Sid found

30:07.006 --> 30:08.975
in our victim's mouth...

30:10.977 --> 30:12.578
Front page.

30:12.611 --> 30:14.246
Chelsea Voice Weekly.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.615
February 6, 2011.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.017
Right,
so the big question is

30:18.050 --> 30:19.618
what's the significance, right?

30:19.651 --> 30:22.188
There's an article about art.

30:22.221 --> 30:24.356
There's an article
about a music festival,

30:24.390 --> 30:25.992
a Valentine's Day benefit.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.160
None of it has anything to do
with our victim.

30:28.194 --> 30:31.030
Of course, he's still
a John Doe, so I could be

30:31.063 --> 30:32.899
staring at the answer
and I wouldn't know it.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.000
ROSS:
Oh, we were staring

30:34.033 --> 30:35.367
at it and didn't even know it.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.336
That's exactly what I just said.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.071
We assumed the phones

30:39.105 --> 30:40.907
inside the hidden pocket
of the suit jacket

30:40.940 --> 30:42.508
were taken from tourists.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.110
All of them were claimed
except for one.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.178
So I called the phone company,
and I got a name.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.915
Alex Henley, 22,
from Astoria, Queens.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.649
And then it dawned on me.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.018
The phone wasn't stolen.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.019
It belongs to our vic.

30:53.052 --> 30:53.953
Okay, there you go.

30:53.986 --> 30:55.988
I sense a promotion
in the near future.

30:56.022 --> 30:58.624
So Alex Henley is our John Doe.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.359
So let's see if he connects
to anything

31:00.392 --> 31:01.994
on the front page of the paper.

31:02.028 --> 31:04.196
(beeping)

31:04.230 --> 31:05.664
No connection.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.400
Maybe it's not the stories
but the date on that front page.

31:10.102 --> 31:11.470
(beeping, sighs)

31:11.503 --> 31:12.972
I hate that sound.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.440
No match.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.575
Wait a minute,

31:16.608 --> 31:18.077
if the connection isn't
to our victim,

31:18.110 --> 31:19.578
it's got to be
to our killer.

31:19.611 --> 31:22.081
Hawkes determined that
the murder weapon was a shank,

31:22.114 --> 31:23.482
making our killer an ex-con.

31:23.515 --> 31:26.953
So connect February 6, 2011,

31:26.986 --> 31:30.389
to any legal actions,
dockets, or convictions.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.293
ROSS:
Whoa, that's a huge file.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.695
Hey, um, do men wear sequins?

31:36.728 --> 31:38.330
I mean,

31:38.364 --> 31:39.631
I know they do
in cabarets and Vegas.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.400
Okay, well, my point is

31:41.433 --> 31:43.302
Hawkes said that
Sid found sequins

31:43.335 --> 31:44.403
on the the vic's suit,

31:44.436 --> 31:45.571
so it could be transfer
from our killer.

31:45.604 --> 31:47.206
That's part of the legend.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.175
Wentworth was allergic to sun,

31:49.208 --> 31:51.477
so he rarely went out, right,
and he always kept

31:51.510 --> 31:52.578
the drapes in his
penthouse closed.

31:52.611 --> 31:56.148
So he made this request
that all his female visitors

31:56.182 --> 31:58.951
wear sequins
to bring in the light.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.352
The club still offers free entry

32:00.386 --> 32:02.021
to any women who still
honor that request.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.023
Okay, let's limit the search
to women.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.492
ROSS:
Hopefully one of them
will be our perp.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.070
Linds, go back a set
of mug shots.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.739
Okay.

32:20.772 --> 32:21.740
This girl right here,
this blonde.

32:21.773 --> 32:22.574
Where were you last night,

32:22.608 --> 32:24.410
Calvin, around 1:00
in the morning?

32:24.443 --> 32:25.444
I can't remember.

32:25.477 --> 32:27.246
Really?

32:27.279 --> 32:29.281
You know, uh...

32:29.315 --> 32:31.117
This is surveillance footage
from the elevator

32:31.150 --> 32:32.584
at the crime scene the
night of the murder,

32:32.618 --> 32:34.053
roughly around 1:00 a.m.,

32:34.086 --> 32:35.387
and this girl right here

32:35.421 --> 32:38.090
is also in this footage.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.458
She's wearing a sequined scarf.

32:43.029 --> 32:47.099
Macy Sullivan,
arrested February 6, 2011.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.001
Criminal possession
of stolen property,

32:49.035 --> 32:50.336
second degree.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.371
February 6, 2011,

32:52.404 --> 32:54.740
that's the connection,
the day she was arrested.

32:54.773 --> 32:57.243
She did a two year sentence
and got out two weeks ago.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.378
Okay, we have her
in the building,

32:59.411 --> 33:01.013
but we don't have her
near the body.

33:01.047 --> 33:01.947
Transfer of the sequin

33:01.980 --> 33:04.083
could have happened anywhere
from anyone.

33:04.116 --> 33:05.451
Well, she's roughly
the same height as the vic.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.619
I mean, it fits.
Circumstantial.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.655
We need a connector
to Alex Henley's murder

33:09.688 --> 33:12.024
by putting her on that landing

33:12.058 --> 33:14.026
with the murder
weapon in her hand.

33:25.637 --> 33:27.439
The partial footprints Adam
photographed at the scene

33:27.473 --> 33:28.540
are small--
could be a woman.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.042
Can't take it
to the D.A.

33:30.076 --> 33:31.410
Any unknown blood
at the scene?

33:31.443 --> 33:32.611
All belonged
to our vic.

33:32.644 --> 33:33.645
We dusted
the door handles

33:33.679 --> 33:35.181
and the glass.
No prints.

33:35.214 --> 33:38.117
Flack and Lovato
got an address on
Macy Sullivan

33:38.150 --> 33:39.751
from her parole officer.
They're headed there now.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.421
P.O. said she didn't
check in today.

33:42.454 --> 33:43.722
She's running.
Get her picture out.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.124
Have all the airports,

33:45.157 --> 33:47.559
bus stations, car rental
companies check

33:47.593 --> 33:48.794
their surveillance
for the past 18 hours.

33:48.827 --> 33:52.164
If he finds her, have Flack pick
her up for parole violation.

33:52.198 --> 33:53.565
In the meantime...

33:53.599 --> 33:55.801
we got to prove that
Macy Sullivan's our killer.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.773
(siren wailing)

34:05.711 --> 34:08.246
Macy Sullivan! NYPD!

34:08.280 --> 34:10.849
She's long gone.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.518
She left in
a hurry, too.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.659
The guys at the lab
might like this.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.529
I think we're looking
for the wrong person.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.364
What do you mean?

34:25.397 --> 34:26.665
I mean she doesn't look like
what we think she looks like.

34:29.435 --> 34:32.138
She's no longer a blonde.
And she cut her hair.

34:34.739 --> 34:35.873
(dialing tones)

34:35.907 --> 34:39.277
I need an APB out on
a Macy Sullivan.

34:39.311 --> 34:40.746
Brunette, short hair.

34:42.813 --> 34:45.150
(typing)

34:51.657 --> 34:54.193
WOMAN (over radio):
All units be advised: female
matching description,

34:54.226 --> 34:57.163
possible sighting
Long Island city bus terminal.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.698
Proceed, no lights, no sirens.

35:06.238 --> 35:08.240
(indistinct chatter)

35:26.458 --> 35:28.227
Hey!

35:28.260 --> 35:29.628
Lovato.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.430
LOVATO:
I see her.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.434
(people yelling)

35:35.467 --> 35:37.169
LOVATO:
NYPD, freeze!

35:37.203 --> 35:38.704
MACY:
Out of my way!

35:57.656 --> 35:59.458
*

36:16.442 --> 36:18.277
*

36:37.963 --> 36:39.765
TAYLOR:
Should've taken it with you.

36:39.798 --> 36:42.568
I was in a hurry.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.836
Found Alex Henley's
blood on the scarf.

36:44.870 --> 36:47.706
Found the scarf in your room.
There was a missing sequin.

36:47.739 --> 36:51.443
Found that on
Henley's body.

36:51.477 --> 36:53.279
Why'd you kill him?

36:56.415 --> 36:58.250
Can't believe
you're here, Macy.

36:58.284 --> 37:00.819
I've been waiting
for this moment a long time.

37:00.852 --> 37:03.355
Finally seeing
you again.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.023
Really?

37:05.056 --> 37:06.892
It's all I've
thought about

37:06.925 --> 37:08.794
since the day
I was convicted.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.228
(gasps)

37:13.365 --> 37:15.534
(chokes)

37:15.567 --> 37:17.235
(panting)

37:41.593 --> 37:43.061
(gasping)

37:43.094 --> 37:44.730
(screams)

37:49.335 --> 37:50.902
You were after revenge.

37:50.936 --> 37:54.840
Hey, I was put away for crimes
that I did not commit.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.875
No matter how many times
I told them

37:56.908 --> 37:58.009
I was innocent,
it didn't matter.

37:58.043 --> 38:02.981
Especially not to Alex Henley.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.416
I trusted him.

38:04.450 --> 38:06.318
I guess I thought
I could trust him

38:06.352 --> 38:08.354
because he was
my boyfriend.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.822
I found the bag in
the closet in our apartment.

38:10.856 --> 38:13.759
I looked inside, called Alex,
and did what he told me to.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.462
MACY:
Alex, what do you want
me to do with it?

38:16.495 --> 38:17.629
ALEX:
Just bring the bag to me.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.965
But why is it in
our apartment?

38:19.998 --> 38:23.869
Macy, calm down.
Just get here as
fast as you can.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.937
(gasps, horn blares)

38:29.375 --> 38:31.377
(siren wailing, Macy gasping)

38:33.645 --> 38:37.115
I read your case file, and
you could've made a deal.

38:37.148 --> 38:37.916
I was innocent.

38:37.949 --> 38:40.652
What would I need
to make a deal?

38:40.686 --> 38:42.421
You were in possession
of stolen property, Macy.

38:42.454 --> 38:45.624
There was a woman that
identified you as someone

38:45.657 --> 38:46.925
she took a picture with,

38:46.958 --> 38:49.094
and then discovered her
necklace was gone.

38:49.127 --> 38:51.029
It's the scam
that you and Alex played.

38:51.062 --> 38:52.130
The one he continued to play.

38:52.163 --> 38:56.535
I was not the thief, okay?

38:56.568 --> 38:59.037
It was Alex.
It was only Alex.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.939
I didn't know

39:00.972 --> 39:02.140
that he was stealing
from people.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.710
I thought we were just taking
pictures and making money.

39:10.516 --> 39:11.983
(camera shutter clicks)

39:14.486 --> 39:16.722
(camera shutter clicks)

39:16.755 --> 39:19.024
But I never for one second
considered

39:19.057 --> 39:20.892
that he was the one stealing.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.628
*

39:25.931 --> 39:27.165
(camera shutter clicks)

39:27.198 --> 39:28.233
When I found the bag,
he told me that

39:28.266 --> 39:31.069
he was holding it for a friend,
and I believed him.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.103
But there was no friend.

39:32.137 --> 39:34.105
No.

39:34.139 --> 39:36.074
So...

39:36.107 --> 39:40.712
I sat in prison and came up
with my plan.

39:45.517 --> 39:48.119
He was gonna pay.

39:59.097 --> 40:02.067
Was it all worth going
back to prison, Macy?

40:02.100 --> 40:07.706
I got him back
for what he did to me.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.875
So, yeah, it was worth it.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.854
(door closes)

40:26.892 --> 40:30.128
Hey, I'm sorry I interrupted
your plans for your day off.

40:30.161 --> 40:34.099
Oh, it was an unexpected
pleasure, Grant, really.

40:34.132 --> 40:35.667
Something my sister
would have done.

40:35.701 --> 40:38.904
She was so spontaneous
and unpredictable.

40:38.937 --> 40:43.008
And irresponsible,
but very loving.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.547
I haven't know you
very long,

40:48.580 --> 40:50.616
but if feels right that
you have her heart.

40:53.619 --> 40:56.187
Why was this so
important to you?

40:56.221 --> 41:01.059
Transplant patients aren't
always as lucky as I was.

41:01.092 --> 41:05.030
Every breath that I take,
I cherish.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.965
It's still hard knowing
that someone had

41:06.998 --> 41:10.001
to die so I could live.

41:10.035 --> 41:14.806
And I wanted to say thank you...
to somebody.

41:16.274 --> 41:17.676
You're welcome.

41:23.014 --> 41:26.652
I-I have a... (chuckles)

41:26.685 --> 41:29.655
I have the craziest request.

41:29.688 --> 41:32.891
Can I listen to your heart?

41:32.924 --> 41:34.693
Hear it beat?

41:36.895 --> 41:38.496
Absolutely.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.205
Oh.

41:51.577 --> 41:54.713
It's strong. (chuckles)

41:57.949 --> 42:00.185
Oh, it's beautiful.

42:07.893 --> 42:10.161
(sighs) Thank you.

42:11.129 --> 42:13.164
You bet.

42:25.010 --> 42:26.978
Okay, so, we're good.
Whoa, guys, guys,
here she goes.

42:27.012 --> 42:28.246
What?
Here she goes.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.182
(speaking quietly)

42:31.216 --> 42:33.084
HAWKES:
No, no, this is no time
for questions.

42:33.118 --> 42:34.986
I got money on the line.
Exciting.

42:35.020 --> 42:37.589
Hey, guys.
Hey, what are you doing here?

42:37.623 --> 42:39.090
I thought this was your day off.

42:39.124 --> 42:40.158
It was.
It was terrific.

42:40.191 --> 42:42.160
What are you all doing?

42:42.193 --> 42:43.328
Sid thinks she's
about to tell him.

42:43.361 --> 42:44.663
Oh, yeah.
Who's she? Tell who what?

42:44.696 --> 42:45.831
Oh, here we go.
Here we go.

42:45.864 --> 42:48.266
Hey.
Hey. You ready
to hit the road?

42:49.735 --> 42:51.169
Danny, I'm pregnant.

42:52.303 --> 42:53.672
What?

42:53.705 --> 42:55.974
Are you being serious
with me right now?

42:56.007 --> 42:57.809
Yes. I've thrown up twice today.

42:57.843 --> 42:59.945
I've taken four pregnancy tests,
and they were all positive.

42:59.978 --> 43:01.713
Really? Really?
Yeah.

43:01.747 --> 43:02.781
HAWKES:
There we go.

43:02.814 --> 43:03.882
Look-Looking good.

43:03.915 --> 43:05.250
No.

43:05.283 --> 43:06.217
Yes.

43:06.251 --> 43:07.619
Sid...
No, no, no.

43:07.653 --> 43:09.020
Wait, wait-wait
for it.

43:09.054 --> 43:11.723
Lucy's gonna be a big sister.
(sighs)

43:11.757 --> 43:14.225
We're having a baby!

43:14.259 --> 43:16.161
ALL:
Aw...

43:16.194 --> 43:18.797
Oh, my God.
Pay up, gentlemen.

43:18.830 --> 43:21.232
We're having a baby, Mac.

43:21.266 --> 43:22.868
(chuckles)
Congratulations.

43:22.901 --> 43:24.235
Thank you very much.

43:24.269 --> 43:25.236
There you go.

43:25.270 --> 43:26.237
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.338
Where is it?

43:27.372 --> 43:28.807
ROSS:
You take checks?

43:28.840 --> 43:29.941
She's pregnant.

43:29.975 --> 43:31.242
I'm gone one day
and she's pregnant.

43:31.276 --> 43:33.178
(laughing)

43:33.211 --> 43:34.780
Don't you think
it's a little early

43:34.813 --> 43:36.114
to be telling everybody?

43:36.147 --> 43:38.249
Uh, I think they
already know.

43:42.688 --> 43:45.190
ROSS: Congratulations.
Was there a bet?

43:45.223 --> 43:46.257
Uh, yeah.
