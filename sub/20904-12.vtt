<b>Like an absolute.</b>

11:48.675 --> 11:50.143
<b>Maybe we'll brush</b>
<b>a little more black</b>

11:50.210 --> 11:52.145
<b>up against</b>
<b>those teeth at the bottom.</b>

11:52.212 --> 11:55.415

<b>- Oh, holy cow.</b>
<b>That is crazy cool.</b>

12:19.573 --> 12:23.177
<b>- Nice armpit tattoo. I mean,</b>
<b>it's really [bleep] awesome.</b>

12:23.243 --> 12:26.880
<b> <i>- Doom went ahead and did some</i> </b>
<b> <i>wonky-ass lines on his queen.</i> </b>

12:26.947 --> 12:29.983
<b>I mean, her face,</b>
<b>boom, she got hit by a truck.</b>

12:30.083 --> 12:33.253
<b>This chick got hit by the ugly</b>

12:33.320 --> 12:36.123
<b>- Thank you so much.</b>
<b>- See you tomorrow.</b>

12:36.190 --> 12:38.792
<b>- Are you trying to make up</b>
<b>a bunch of [bleep] to distract</b>

12:38.859 --> 12:40.494
<b>from the tattoo today?</b>
<b>- I'm not making up anything.</b>

12:40.561 --> 12:42.162
<b>I'm trying to, like,</b>
<b>be really nice, but--</b>

12:42.229 --> 12:45.098
<b>- No you're not.</b>
<b>You're a snake in the grass.</b>

12:47.985 --> 12:51.689
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

12:51.756 --> 12:54.025
<b>- Your tattoo</b>
<b>had a lot of issues.</b>

12:54.091 --> 12:55.693
<b>- What makes you say that?</b>

12:55.760 --> 12:58.496
<b>- What I saw in there was</b>
<b>all the concentric circles</b>

12:58.562 --> 13:00.464
<b>not tracking with each other.</b>

13:00.531 --> 13:03.634
<b>- It's definitely wavy.</b>
<b>- No, it's not.</b>

13:03.701 --> 13:05.036
<b>- The lines aren't meeting up.</b>

13:05.102 --> 13:06.570
<b>- They're definitely</b>
<b>not crooked.</b>

13:06.637 --> 13:08.606
<b>- And when the swelling</b>
<b>comes down,</b>

13:08.673 --> 13:10.308
<b>that tattoo will sit</b>
<b>exactly how it needs to sit.</b>

13:10.374 --> 13:11.709
<b>- Yeah, that's not gonna happen.</b>

13:11.776 --> 13:12.877
<b>I would have broke</b>
<b>that sucker up</b>

13:12.943 --> 13:14.145
<b>with [bleep] more rope</b>

13:14.211 --> 13:15.613
<b>than he could shake a stick at.</b>

13:15.680 --> 13:17.381
<b>- Was that your</b>
<b>strategy for your piece?</b>

13:17.448 --> 13:20.017
<b>You just made it kind of crazy</b>
<b>and confusing?</b>

13:20.084 --> 13:22.353
<b>- Yeah, 100%.</b>
<b>- I mean, he had some</b>

13:22.420 --> 13:24.789
<b>crazy skin texture</b>
<b>and stretch marks.</b>

13:24.855 --> 13:27.124
<b>He said he lost 100 pounds</b>
<b>over the past year?</b>

13:27.191 --> 13:29.260
<b>- Okay, are you trying to</b>
<b>make up a bunch of [bleep]</b>

13:29.327 --> 13:30.594
<b>to distract</b>
<b>from the tattoo today?</b>

13:30.661 --> 13:32.163
<b>- We're not making up anything.</b>

13:32.229 --> 13:33.798
<b>- I'm trying to</b>
<b>be really nice, but--</b>

13:33.864 --> 13:36.300
<b>- No you're not.</b>
<b>You're a snake in the grass.</b>

13:36.367 --> 13:38.202
<b>- What are you talking about?</b>
<b>- You guys are trying</b>

13:38.269 --> 13:39.737
<b>to get us out of the house.</b>

13:39.804 --> 13:41.539
<b>- We know you guys</b>
<b>are gunning for us.</b>

13:41.605 --> 13:43.441
<b>- I'm real talking with y'all.</b>
<b>The tattoo looked bad.</b>

13:43.507 --> 13:45.776
<b>- We'll see about that.</b>

14:01.859 --> 14:04.161
<b>- Good morning, artists.</b>
<b>Yesterday you tattooed</b>

14:04.228 --> 14:05.963
<b>your canvas's left armpit.</b>

14:06.030 --> 14:09.934
<b>Today, the opposite artist</b>
<b>will tattoo the right armpit.</b>

14:10.001 --> 14:14.438
<b>However, you won't be working</b>
<b>on the same canvas</b>

14:14.505 --> 14:16.240
<b>your teammate tattooed.</b>

14:16.307 --> 14:20.177
<b>The shops must all</b>
<b>swap canvases.</b>

14:20.244 --> 14:22.113
<b>- What?</b>
<b>- Another shop will</b>

14:22.179 --> 14:23.881
<b>be finishing what you started.</b>

14:23.948 --> 14:25.616
<b>And your shop must finish</b>

14:25.683 --> 14:29.186
<b>what someone else started,</b>
<b>tattooing the right armpit.</b>

14:29.253 --> 14:31.155
<b>- [laughs]</b>
<b>- Why?</b>

14:31.222 --> 14:33.891
<b>- Holy crap.</b>
<b>We were all prepared to do what</b>

14:33.924 --> 14:37.528
<b>we were prepared to do, and</b>
<b>now we've got to switch it up.</b>

14:37.595 --> 14:40.197
<b>- You can choose</b>
<b>to share your design or not.</b>

14:40.264 --> 14:42.199
<b>You can alter the design</b>
<b>for the right armpit,</b>

14:42.266 --> 14:44.769
<b>but you cannot</b>
<b>touch the left armpit.</b>

14:44.902 --> 14:50.174
<b>Judges will compare your work</b>
<b>side by side with two artists.</b>

14:50.241 --> 14:52.743
<b>The artist who completes</b>
<b>the armpit tattoo you started,</b>

14:52.843 --> 14:56.981
<b>and the artist whose</b>
<b>armpit tattoo you complete.</b>

14:57.048 --> 14:59.750
<b>Your placement must be</b>
<b>perfect so the two tattoos work</b>

14:59.850 --> 15:03.654
<b>together and looks like one</b>
<b>artist tattooed both armpits.</b>

15:03.721 --> 15:05.690
<b>- Basically, you get to look at</b>

15:05.756 --> 15:08.859
<b>all the tattoos and pick</b>
<b>which one you want to finish.</b>

15:08.859 --> 15:11.329
<b>So in judging each canvas,</b>
<b>we'll look at the two people</b>

15:11.395 --> 15:13.597
<b>that did each armpit,</b>
<b>look at both tattoos.</b>

15:13.664 --> 15:15.366
<b>You need two strong tattoos</b>
<b>on your team,</b>

15:15.433 --> 15:18.102
<b>but you also have to match</b>
<b>the other two tattoos.</b>

15:18.169 --> 15:21.238
<b>- On the bottom</b>
<b>of the skulls are numbers.</b>

15:21.305 --> 15:24.141
<b>You'll each draw a skull</b>
<b>to determine a picking order.</b>

15:24.208 --> 15:26.277
<b>In that order,</b>
<b>you'll then select which</b>

15:26.344 --> 15:27.878
<b>armpit you want to complete.</b>

15:27.912 --> 15:31.215
<b>You cannot choose</b>
<b>your own shop's tattoo.</b>

15:31.282 --> 15:33.651
<b>One by one,</b>
<b>please choose a skull.</b>

15:33.718 --> 15:35.419
<b>Old Town Ink, you're up first.</b>

15:35.486 --> 15:37.655
<b>- I feel like this is</b>
<b>the most important skull pick</b>

15:37.722 --> 15:39.590
<b>in the history of this</b>
<b>competition.</b>

15:39.657 --> 15:43.194
<b>It all boils down</b>
<b>to the number that you get.</b>

15:43.260 --> 15:45.062
<b>Number one.</b>
<b>- Booyah!</b>

15:45.129 --> 15:47.298
<b>- Yeah, buddy!</b>
<b>- That's my boy.</b>

15:47.365 --> 15:49.233
<b>- Golden Skull Tattoo.</b>

15:49.300 --> 15:51.569
<b>- Six.</b>
<b>- Unkindness Art.</b>

15:51.636 --> 15:54.305
<b>- Four.</b>
<b>- Empire State Studio.</b>

15:54.372 --> 15:56.407
<b>- Seven.</b>
<b>- Oh!</b>

15:56.474 --> 15:59.276
<b>- Of course I get number seven.</b>

15:59.343 --> 16:02.480
<b>Now I have no choice</b>
<b>on who I want to work with.</b>

16:02.546 --> 16:04.615
<b>- Black Cobra Tattoo.</b>

16:04.682 --> 16:06.017
<b>- Two.</b>
<b>- Yes!</b>

16:06.083 --> 16:09.020
<b>- Allegory Arts.</b>
<b>- Five.</b>

16:09.086 --> 16:12.156
<b>- Basilica Tattoo.</b>
<b>- Three.</b>

16:12.223 --> 16:14.458
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>That is the picking order.</b>

16:14.525 --> 16:16.994
<b>Let's bring in the canvases.</b>

16:20.965 --> 16:23.634
<b>Canvases,</b>
<b>please show us your tattoos.</b>

16:27.305 --> 16:30.741
<b>Old Town Ink,</b>
<b>which canvas do you choose?</b>

16:30.875 --> 16:32.777
<b>- We choose Basilica's canvas.</b>

16:32.877 --> 16:34.979
<b> <i>I love doing</i> </b>
<b> <i>realistic images like that.</i> </b>

16:35.046 --> 16:36.881

<b>- Black Cobra Tattoo,</b>
<b>which canvas do you choose?</b>

16:39.450 --> 16:41.285
<b>- We choose</b>
<b>Old Town Ink's canvas.</b>

<b> <i>- After looking</i> </b>

16:46.824 --> 16:48.292
<b>- All right, Basilica?</b>

16:48.359 --> 16:50.194
<b>Which canvas do you choose?</b>

16:50.261 --> 16:53.197

16:56.267 --> 16:57.835
<b>I'm gonna show</b>

17:35.039 --> 17:36.741
<b>- We choose Black Cobra Tattoo's</b>
<b>canvas.</b>

17:36.874 --> 17:38.876
<b>- And that means,</b>
<b>Empire State Studio,</b>

17:38.943 --> 17:40.878
<b>you get Golden Skull's canvas.</b>

17:40.911 --> 17:43.614
<b>- Of course no one</b>
<b>wanted that canvas.</b>

17:43.681 --> 17:47.051
<b> <i>It's gonna be impossible to do</i> </b>
<b> <i>an impression of a Cleen tattoo.</i> </b>

17:47.118 --> 17:49.020
<b>- Once you consult</b>
<b>with your new canvas,</b>

17:49.086 --> 17:52.456
<b>you'll have six hours</b>
<b>to tattoo the right armpit.</b>

17:52.523 --> 17:55.593
<b>Based on your</b>
<b>work on both canvases,</b>

17:55.660 --> 17:58.129
<b>one shop will be packing.</b>

17:58.195 --> 17:59.930
<b>Good luck.</b>

17:59.997 --> 18:01.399
<b>- I was hoping to get you.</b>

18:01.465 --> 18:02.700
<b>- I love doing</b>
<b>American traditional,</b>

18:02.833 --> 18:04.535
<b>so this kind of worked out cool.</b>

18:04.602 --> 18:06.671
<b> <i>- Swapping the designs</i> </b>
<b> <i>is completely not something</i> </b>

18:06.737 --> 18:08.472
<b>these artists expected.</b>

18:08.539 --> 18:10.741
<b>- The other side you wanted</b>
<b>to do with a wrench, though?</b>

18:10.841 --> 18:12.710
<b>Yeah, a wrench, and maybe</b>
<b>a skateboard wheel and a bolt.</b>

18:12.843 --> 18:14.679
<b>- The whole point of this is</b>
<b>to test the artist on stepping</b>

18:14.745 --> 18:16.480
<b> <i>out of their comfort zone,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and how well they work</i> </b>

18:16.547 --> 18:18.149
<b>off of somebody else's artwork.</b>

18:18.215 --> 18:20.017
<b>- What was their</b>
<b>idea for the other side,</b>

18:20.084 --> 18:21.585
<b>or what were they gonna do?</b>
<b>- Like, vampire-type teeth.</b>

18:21.652 --> 18:22.887
<b>- I just want to talk to them</b>

18:22.954 --> 18:24.588
<b>and see if they'll share</b>
<b>anything.</b>

18:24.655 --> 18:25.990
<b>- It's supposed to look</b>
<b>like one artist did it.</b>

18:26.057 --> 18:27.558
<b>That's the big test here.</b>

18:27.625 --> 18:29.360
<b>- What happened?</b>
<b>You're gonna give me a drawing,</b>

18:29.427 --> 18:31.028
<b>or...I think</b>
<b>it's a beautiful drawing.</b>

18:31.095 --> 18:33.731
<b>- You do think</b>
<b>it's a beautiful drawing.</b>

18:33.864 --> 18:35.933
<b>- That matches</b>
<b>the same size as the other one.</b>

18:36.000 --> 18:37.902
<b>Just plug your stuff in.</b>
<b>- Awesome. Thanks so much, man.</b>

18:37.969 --> 18:39.370
<b>- Thank you so much, kid.</b>

18:39.437 --> 18:40.871
<b>- Oh, I should've made you beg.</b>

18:40.905 --> 18:42.673
<b>We're gonna have</b>
<b>some favors later on.</b>

18:42.740 --> 18:44.709
<b>I need to change</b>
<b>part of Cleen's design,</b>

18:44.775 --> 18:46.911
<b>because you can't</b>
<b>understand what's there.</b>

18:46.978 --> 18:49.046
<b>I think what I'm gonna do,</b>
<b>though, is I'm gonna change it,</b>

18:49.113 --> 18:51.449
<b>'cause he's got a little</b>
<b>bit more going on in here.</b>

18:51.515 --> 18:52.817
<b>I think we'll blow up that</b>
<b>skateboard wheel</b>

18:52.850 --> 18:54.251
<b>a little bit too.</b>

18:54.318 --> 18:56.253
<b>I'm gonna make it</b>
<b>a lot bigger and show off</b>

18:56.320 --> 18:57.455
<b>the skateboard wheel.</b>

18:57.521 --> 18:59.824
<b>What Cleen drew is sub-par.</b>

18:59.857 --> 19:02.126
<b>- Hello, we're creeping.</b>
<b>- I had an idea.</b>

19:02.193 --> 19:03.828
<b>I don't know if</b>
<b>you guys are into it.</b>

19:03.861 --> 19:05.529
<b>- You can watch our backs</b>
<b>later if I give you</b>

19:05.596 --> 19:08.132
<b>that drawing, at some point?</b>
<b>- Absolutely.</b>

19:08.199 --> 19:10.501
<b>- It's like stencil-ready.</b>
<b>Like, I have a stencil for you.</b>

19:10.568 --> 19:12.637
<b>- There's some silly</b>
<b>things going on in this drawing.</b>

19:12.703 --> 19:15.139
<b>There's definitely gonna be some</b>
<b>changes that need to be made.</b>

19:15.206 --> 19:16.874
<b>- Fixing up my chopsticks?</b>

19:16.941 --> 19:19.610
<b>- Yeah, I'm gonna do a little</b>
<b>different chopsticks.</b>

19:19.677 --> 19:22.647
<b>Making that a little</b>
<b>less confusing.</b>

19:22.713 --> 19:25.416
<b> <i>- It's completely driving</i> </b>
<b> <i>DJ crazy</i> </b>

19:25.483 --> 19:27.151
<b>that I'm making</b>
<b>changes to his design.</b>

19:27.218 --> 19:29.120
<b>- A lot of Japanese</b>
<b>stuff's kind of goofy to me.</b>

19:29.186 --> 19:31.188
<b> <i>- I got news, DJ.</i> </b>

19:31.255 --> 19:34.992
<b>You need to go back</b>
<b>to school on Japanese.</b>

19:35.059 --> 19:36.761
<b>- It's pretty rough.</b>

19:36.861 --> 19:39.864
<b>- Makes me cringe, because</b>
<b>there's no room for error.</b>

19:39.930 --> 19:41.532
<b>Don't leave question marks.</b>

19:41.599 --> 19:44.368
<b>- Just do what the thing's</b>
<b>supposed to look like.</b>

19:47.782 --> 19:49.951
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

19:51.886 --> 19:53.621
<b>- Hey, there.</b>
<b>- Hey.</b>

19:53.688 --> 19:56.591
<b>- What's your plan, chief?</b>
<b>- I'm gonna redraw a little bit.</b>

19:56.658 --> 19:59.027
<b>You know, put my own</b>
<b>[bleep] into it, I think.</b>

19:59.094 --> 20:00.562
<b>- Of course.</b>
<b>- Allegory's nice enough</b>

20:00.628 --> 20:01.863
<b>to give me their drawing,</b>
<b>but I'm gonna</b>

20:01.930 --> 20:03.098
<b>do something totally original</b>

20:03.164 --> 20:04.666
<b>and show Allegory how it's done.</b>

20:04.732 --> 20:06.668
<b>This is the best possible</b>
<b>shot at taking them out,</b>

20:06.734 --> 20:08.403
<b>is to say, hey, listen,</b>
<b>I just beat you</b>

20:08.470 --> 20:10.004
<b>at your own game</b>
<b>on your own canvas.</b>

20:10.071 --> 20:11.306
<b>- Cool.</b>
<b>I love it. Yeah.</b>

20:11.372 --> 20:12.907
<b>- I think there's a slight risk,</b>

20:12.974 --> 20:14.776
<b>but I'm willing</b>
<b>to take it and just slay it.</b>

20:14.843 --> 20:17.846
<b>- You take those risks,</b>
<b>and they always seem to pay off.</b>

20:17.912 --> 20:20.582
<b>Strategy. Strategy.</b>
<b>- All right, all right.</b>

20:20.648 --> 20:22.951
<b>- Yesterday was rough.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

20:23.017 --> 20:24.853
<b>- Getting called out,</b>
<b>and it's your honor,</b>

20:24.919 --> 20:26.654
<b>your reputation,</b>
<b>your livelihood.</b>

20:26.721 --> 20:29.357
<b>- Just don't let it</b>
<b>get under your skin.</b>

20:32.594 --> 20:34.129
<b>- All right, guys,</b>

20:34.195 --> 20:36.931
<b>You have six hours</b>
<b>to tattoo the right armpit.</b>

20:36.998 --> 20:40.602
<b>And your time starts now.</b>

20:40.668 --> 20:42.771
<b>- Yeah, like that.</b>
<b>- So look at me.</b>

20:42.837 --> 20:45.640
<b>- There's a lot of strategy</b>
<b>in this competition right now.</b>

20:45.707 --> 20:47.208
<b>- Was that how they</b>
<b>placed it yesterday?</b>

20:47.275 --> 20:49.210
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b> <i>- If a team wins both their</i> </b>

20:49.277 --> 20:51.379
<b>head-to-heads, they're</b>
<b>obviously gonna be in the top.</b>

20:51.446 --> 20:53.415
<b>There might be another</b>
<b>team that has one</b>

20:53.481 --> 20:55.784
<b> <i>really, really strong tattoo,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but if the other one loses,</i> </b>

20:55.850 --> 20:58.720
<b>they could be in the bottom.</b>
<b>- Rock and roll.</b>

21:02.457 --> 21:04.058
<b>- That outline</b>
<b>better be perfect.</b>

21:04.125 --> 21:05.693
<b>- Don't stress me out.</b>
<b>It's gonna be perfect.</b>

21:05.760 --> 21:07.662
<b>- Just make it perfect.</b>
<b>- It will be.</b>

21:07.729 --> 21:09.764
<b>It will be.</b>
<b>- Katie set the bar pretty high.</b>

21:09.831 --> 21:13.001
<b>So Erin needs to execute</b>
<b>this thing flawlessly.</b>

21:13.067 --> 21:16.971
<b>- This is [bleep] boring, dude.</b>
<b>- Welcome to my yesterday.</b>

21:17.038 --> 21:20.675
<b>Worst case scenario,</b>
<b>I wobble one line, done.</b>

21:20.708 --> 21:23.344
<b> <i>Katie designed it.</i> </b>
<b> <i>Katie nailed the line work.</i> </b>

21:23.411 --> 21:25.680
<b> <i>And if I do one wobble,</i> </b>
<b> <i>one transition,</i> </b>

21:25.747 --> 21:28.083
<b> <i>one piece of saturation</i> </b>
<b> <i>not to the line...</i> </b>

21:28.149 --> 21:30.752
<b>That's it. It's over.</b>
<b>No line left behind.</b>

21:30.819 --> 21:32.754
<b>- Those are perfect.</b>
<b>It's got to be perfect.</b>

21:32.821 --> 21:35.190
<b>- I know. It will be.</b>

21:35.256 --> 21:36.791
<b>- I feel like we should bring</b>
<b>that beard</b>

21:36.858 --> 21:38.326
<b>down a little bit</b>
<b>so it matches, right?</b>

21:38.393 --> 21:39.828
<b>- That's the only</b>
<b>thing that I noticed.</b>

21:39.894 --> 21:41.763
<b>- I have never</b>
<b>tattooed the armpit.</b>

21:41.830 --> 21:43.798
<b> <i>One of my biggest concerns</i> </b>
<b> <i>with this particular piece</i> </b>

21:43.865 --> 21:45.700
<b> <i>is the straight lines</i> </b>
<b> <i>in the wrench.</i> </b>

21:45.733 --> 21:49.204
<b> <i>They have to be so on point,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and one pass.</i> </b>

21:49.270 --> 21:52.640
<b>If I have any blowouts on it,</b>
<b>we're gonna be ruined.</b>

21:52.640 --> 21:55.110
<b>I think my concentration</b>
<b>today is line work.</b>

21:59.714 --> 22:01.249
<b>Four hours to go, kids.</b>

22:01.316 --> 22:03.418
<b>Four more hours.</b>

22:06.888 --> 22:09.257
<b>- Did it line up okay?</b>
<b>- Yeah, it lined up great.</b>

22:09.324 --> 22:11.459
<b>- Cool.</b>
<b> <i>- Erin is a great artist,</i> </b>

22:11.526 --> 22:14.429
<b> <i>so it's good to know</i> </b>
<b> <i>I have a good roadmap,</i> </b>

22:14.496 --> 22:16.865
<b>and I don't have to worry</b>
<b>about anything being messed up.</b>

22:16.931 --> 22:18.666
<b>I didn't realize that this would</b>

22:18.666 --> 22:21.136
<b>be directly putting us</b>
<b>head to head with Unkindness.</b>

22:21.202 --> 22:25.039
<b>- So at first I thought the</b>
<b>whole goal of the second tattoo</b>

22:25.106 --> 22:27.842
<b> <i>was just to match the tattoo</i> </b>
<b> <i>that was done yesterday.</i> </b>

22:27.909 --> 22:29.511
<b> <i>And then I kind of realized</i> </b>

22:29.577 --> 22:32.113
<b>that me and Doom</b>
<b>are going head to head.</b>

22:32.180 --> 22:33.481
<b>Whoops.</b>

22:35.884 --> 22:37.152
<b>- What's going on?</b>

22:37.218 --> 22:39.154
<b>- I used Tommy's drawing</b>
<b>as a base,</b>

22:39.220 --> 22:41.489
<b>and I messed</b>
<b>with the shape a lot.</b>

22:41.556 --> 22:43.024
<b>- Why'd you use his?</b>
<b>- I thought that he'd drawn it</b>

22:43.091 --> 22:44.692
<b>to fit that space,</b>
<b>and he hadn't.</b>

22:44.692 --> 22:46.127
<b>His side was super gnarly,</b>

22:46.194 --> 22:47.228
<b>so I wanted to make this side</b>

22:47.295 --> 22:48.696
<b>just a little gnarlier</b>

22:48.763 --> 22:50.265
<b>than what he had drawn it.</b>

22:50.331 --> 22:51.900
<b>- And now you've got</b>
<b>to keep up with that one.</b>

22:51.966 --> 22:53.435
<b>- Oh, I know.</b>

22:53.501 --> 22:55.270
<b>I am definitely</b>
<b>nervous about this tattoo.</b>

22:55.336 --> 22:57.972
<b> <i>It's a very high-risk move</i> </b>
<b> <i>on my part,</i> </b>

22:58.039 --> 23:01.309
<b> <i>because it</i> </b>
<b> <i>is extremely detailed.</i> </b>

23:01.376 --> 23:04.179
<b> <i>And I'm just worried</i> </b>
<b> <i>the judges are not gonna think</i> </b>

23:04.245 --> 23:07.482
<b>it's dynamic enough</b>
<b>to compete against Marv's.</b>

23:09.651 --> 23:10.985
<b>- Who do you think</b>
<b>looks the closest right now?</b>

23:11.052 --> 23:12.287
<b>- Closest to each other?</b>

23:12.353 --> 23:14.689
<b>These guys and them.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

23:14.756 --> 23:17.092
<b>But it's not about</b>
<b>who's doing okay,</b>

23:17.158 --> 23:18.927
<b>it's about</b>
<b>who ain't gonna make it.</b>

23:18.993 --> 23:20.762
<b>- Eva's still looks terrible.</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>

23:20.829 --> 23:23.098
<b>- So far, Ulyss's outline,</b>
<b>it's not looking too bad.</b>

23:23.164 --> 23:25.834
<b>- He's killing it. It looks</b>
<b>better that Doom's outline.</b>

23:25.900 --> 23:28.303
<b>- Doom's outline is terrible.</b>

23:28.369 --> 23:30.038
<b>- Two hours to go.</b>

23:36.044 --> 23:37.445
<b>- There's a couple</b>
<b>technical things,</b>

23:37.512 --> 23:38.880
<b>as far as, like, the lines.</b>

23:38.947 --> 23:40.749
<b>- This tattoo</b>
<b>is looking bad-ass.</b>

23:40.815 --> 23:43.451
<b> <i>I don't think this canvas is</i> </b>
<b> <i>anywhere near as bad</i> </b>

23:43.518 --> 23:45.086
<b>as Allegory was making it</b>
<b>sound to be.</b>

23:45.153 --> 23:47.422
<b>- I love how crispy clean</b>
<b>that is.</b>

23:47.489 --> 23:50.625
<b>I want you to completely</b>
<b>destroy this.</b>

23:50.692 --> 23:52.160
<b>- Well, what's a better way</b>
<b>to get somebody</b>

23:52.227 --> 23:54.696
<b>than go right</b>
<b>at them at their own game?</b>

23:54.763 --> 23:56.798
<b>- That red is</b>
<b>[bleep] throwing me off.</b>

23:56.865 --> 23:58.399
<b>I might have you sit back down.</b>

23:58.466 --> 23:59.901
<b>I keep thinking</b>
<b>I'm done with this guy,</b>

23:59.968 --> 24:01.136
<b>and every time he stands up</b>

24:01.202 --> 24:02.871
<b> <i>and I look at it in the mirror,</i> </b>

24:02.937 --> 24:04.639
<b>I can see the parts</b>
<b>that don't look finished to me.</b>

24:04.672 --> 24:06.207
<b>I'd have been done a while back</b>

24:06.274 --> 24:08.743
<b>if it weren't</b>
<b>for the stretch marks, ,man.</b>

24:08.810 --> 24:10.645
<b>- I just like checking</b>
<b>out everybody's setup here.</b>

24:10.712 --> 24:12.380
<b>- Noelin had a way more</b>
<b>simple piece.</b>

24:12.447 --> 24:14.115
<b>Bubba's piece is way</b>
<b>more dynamic.</b>

24:14.182 --> 24:15.650
<b>- Sorry, man, I keep staring.</b>

24:15.683 --> 24:19.154
<b>- He could take</b>
<b>the win on this one.</b>

24:19.220 --> 24:24.058
<b>- Five,</b>
<b>four, three, two, one.</b>

24:24.125 --> 24:25.493
<b>That's it. Machines down.</b>

24:25.560 --> 24:28.329
<b>Time is up.</b>
<b>No more ink.</b>

24:28.396 --> 24:29.731
<b>- Yeah, that's it.</b>

24:29.798 --> 24:33.101
<b>- Check it out.</b>
<b>- Yes!</b>

24:35.303 --> 24:36.871
<b>- Nice.</b>

24:40.675 --> 24:43.211
<b>- She's got it on the picture,</b>
<b>I was like, damn.</b>

24:44.379 --> 24:46.114
<b>- That outline's [bleep]ed.</b>

24:46.181 --> 24:47.615
<b>- It's gonna come down to teams</b>

24:47.615 --> 24:49.084
<b>and how they did together.</b>

24:49.150 --> 24:50.819
<b>The only one that I've seen</b>

24:50.885 --> 24:54.622
<b>that really blatantly</b>
<b>had glaring errors was Eva's.</b>

24:54.656 --> 24:59.227
<b>0 Did nobody tell her besides</b>
<b>me that it looked jacked up?</b>

24:59.294 --> 25:01.496
<b>- Pretty sure</b>
<b>I just kicked her ass.</b>

25:01.629 --> 25:03.131
<b>I don't think there's gonna be</b>
<b>any question</b>

25:03.198 --> 25:04.866
<b>when the judges</b>
<b>see me and hers together.</b>

25:04.933 --> 25:07.068
<b>I ain't worried.</b>

25:07.135 --> 25:08.636
<b>No way.</b>

25:11.586 --> 25:14.856
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

25:14.922 --> 25:17.325
<b>- We know the way</b>
<b>everybody keeps talking</b>

25:17.391 --> 25:19.360
<b>about Eva's tattoo,</b>
<b>we're gonna end up</b>

25:19.427 --> 25:20.862
<b>going to the bottom</b>
<b>no matter what.</b>

25:20.928 --> 25:22.130
<b>- The house is, like,</b>
<b>ganging up.</b>

25:22.196 --> 25:23.598
<b>- Yeah, they're ganging up.</b>

25:23.664 --> 25:24.766
<b>- They're just completely</b>
<b>overlooking</b>

25:24.832 --> 25:26.167
<b>the flaws in Christian's</b>

25:26.234 --> 25:27.769
<b>and saying that mine</b>
<b>is way worse.</b>

25:27.835 --> 25:29.804
<b>I mean, that's what</b>
<b>they're going to do.</b>

25:29.871 --> 25:31.305
<b>- If there's one opening to get</b>

25:31.372 --> 25:33.241
<b>any of us out,</b>
<b>they're going to take it.</b>

25:33.307 --> 25:36.711
<b>- I haven't fought this entire</b>
<b>time to let people who literally</b>

25:36.778 --> 25:39.013
<b>just waltzed in be like,</b>
<b>we're just gonna say</b>

25:39.080 --> 25:40.248
<b>whatever to get you out.</b>

25:40.314 --> 25:41.949
<b>- We have something to prove.</b>

25:42.016 --> 25:43.184
<b>Obviously we have</b>
<b>a lot on the line.</b>

25:43.251 --> 25:44.652
<b>It's the same as you guys.</b>

25:44.719 --> 25:46.053
<b>We're the only ones that have</b>
<b>been here</b>

25:46.120 --> 25:47.522
<b>from the beginning.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

25:47.588 --> 25:48.656
<b>- At the end of the day, it's</b>
<b>gonna be</b>

25:48.723 --> 25:49.957
<b>down to the judges.</b>

25:50.024 --> 25:51.759
<b>And I don't think any</b>
<b>of us</b>

25:51.826 --> 25:53.361
<b>have the worst tattoos.</b>
<b>- One thing I do know.</b>

25:53.428 --> 25:54.862
<b>If one of these teams</b>
<b>don't go home,</b>

25:54.929 --> 25:58.099
<b>that's gonna</b>
<b>ruffle their feathers.</b>

26:00.134 --> 26:07.308
<b> <i>♪ ♪</i> </b>

26:11.112 --> 26:13.815
<b>- This week,</b>
<b>you showed placement</b>

26:13.881 --> 26:15.483
<b>by tattooing a painful</b>
<b>and awkward</b>

26:15.550 --> 26:17.418
<b>part of the body, the armpits.</b>

26:17.485 --> 26:18.986
<b>The judges will compare</b>
<b>your work</b>

26:19.053 --> 26:21.422
<b>side by side with two artists,</b>

26:21.489 --> 26:24.459
<b>the artist who completed the</b>
<b>armpit tattoo that you started,</b>

26:24.525 --> 26:27.361
<b>and the artist whose</b>
<b>armpit tattoo your completed.</b>

26:27.428 --> 26:31.599
<b>See how you did. Aaron and</b>
<b>Katie, you're up first.</b>

26:32.934 --> 26:34.569
<b>All right, Katie,</b>
<b>you tattooed the first armpit.</b>

26:34.635 --> 26:36.971
<b> <i>Both of these tattoos together,</i> </b>
<b> <i>top notch.</i> </b>

26:37.038 --> 26:40.108
<b> <i>So I commend you guys</i> </b>
<b> <i>for application, for style,</i> </b>

26:40.174 --> 26:41.843
<b>for looking</b>
<b>similar to each other.</b>

26:41.909 --> 26:44.045
<b> <i>- If you look at</i> </b>
<b> <i>the subtle differences here,</i> </b>

26:44.112 --> 26:45.880
<b> <i>in Katie's 's bigger flower,</i> </b>

26:45.947 --> 26:47.648
<b> <i>the red fades</i> </b>
<b> <i>to that peach tone--</i> </b>

26:47.715 --> 26:49.684
<b> <i>it's super, super smooth,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and then</i> </b>

26:49.750 --> 26:52.186
<b> <i>the thin line is really</i> </b>
<b> <i>nice and clean.</i> </b>

26:52.253 --> 26:54.155
<b>And then if you look at</b>
<b>Aaron's pink flower</b>

26:54.222 --> 26:56.357
<b>with the blue star in there,</b>
<b>you see some wavering problems</b>

26:56.390 --> 26:57.759
<b>with the little thin line.</b>

26:57.825 --> 26:59.227
<b>Katie outshines you</b>
<b>a little bit.</b>

26:59.360 --> 27:00.762
<b>- She drew it.</b>
<b>I'm not surprised.</b>

27:00.828 --> 27:02.430
<b>- Katie takes it,</b>

27:02.497 --> 27:03.731
<b>just with those tiny little bits</b>
<b>of application.</b>

27:03.798 --> 27:04.799
<b>When you're this close,</b>

27:04.866 --> 27:06.868
<b>it's apples to apples.</b>

27:08.970 --> 27:12.573
<b>- Matt and DJ, you're up next.</b>

27:12.640 --> 27:15.610
<b> <i>DJ, you started</i> </b>
<b> <i>off with the Oni mask.</i> </b>

27:15.676 --> 27:18.146
<b> <i>- DJ, I like this tattoo.</i> </b>
<b> <i>I think it looks super sharp.</i> </b>

27:18.212 --> 27:20.081
<b> <i>But the crooked</i> </b>
<b> <i>face does bug me.</i> </b>

27:20.148 --> 27:22.917
<b> <i>The fact that the nose</i> </b>
<b> <i>is curving and going one way,</i> </b>

27:22.984 --> 27:24.752
<b>and teeth kind of not lining up,</b>

27:24.819 --> 27:27.054
<b>it's like a new school</b>
<b>rendition of a Japanese tattoo.</b>

27:27.121 --> 27:30.158
<b>- If you're gonna twist it,</b>
<b>twist it everywhere.</b>

27:30.224 --> 27:32.059
<b> <i>- When I see these,</i> </b>
<b> <i>it makes me cringe,</i> </b>

27:32.126 --> 27:33.361
<b> <i>because it's not</i> </b>
<b> <i>a follow-through.</i> </b>

27:33.428 --> 27:34.862
<b>- Matt.</b>

27:34.929 --> 27:36.631
<b> <i>- The mouth is a little</i> </b>
<b> <i>more legible,</i> </b>

27:36.697 --> 27:38.533
<b> <i>and I like what</i> </b>
<b> <i>you did with the hair picks.</i> </b>

27:38.599 --> 27:41.335
<b>- Now, I did make a few</b>
<b>just kind of stylistic changes.</b>

27:41.402 --> 27:43.638
<b>- Overall, you captured the look</b>

27:43.704 --> 27:45.339
<b> <i>we want to see a little more</i> </b>

27:45.406 --> 27:47.074
<b> <i>in your rendition</i> </b>
<b> <i>of DJ's drawing.</i> </b>

27:47.141 --> 27:49.610
<b>- Just in terms of overall</b>
<b>aesthetics,</b>

27:49.677 --> 27:51.379
<b>we're going with Matt?</b>
<b>- Definitely going with Matt.</b>

27:51.446 --> 27:54.382
<b>- The winner of this</b>
<b>head to head is Matt.</b>

27:57.018 --> 27:59.353
<b>Bubba and Noelin.</b>

27:59.387 --> 28:02.657
<b>- Hyper-photorealism</b>
<b>in an armpit</b>

28:02.723 --> 28:04.992
<b> <i>is definitely a tough ask,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but Noelin,</i> </b>

28:05.059 --> 28:08.396
<b> <i>I do think you capture the off</i> </b>
<b> <i>the skin crawly, creepy look.</i> </b>

28:08.463 --> 28:11.365
<b>- The subtle little shadows</b>
<b>you have on the tips of the leg</b>

28:11.432 --> 28:12.967
<b> <i>give it that 3D effect.</i> </b>

28:13.034 --> 28:15.303
<b>- Bubba, yours is really</b>
<b>tonal throughout.</b>

28:15.336 --> 28:16.971
<b>As far as placement goes, man,</b>

28:17.038 --> 28:18.773
<b>you're handed a canvas</b>
<b>that had one tattoo already,</b>

28:18.840 --> 28:20.374
<b>and you're supposed</b>
<b>to add another one to match.</b>

28:20.441 --> 28:21.642
<b>You don't have</b>
<b>a matching shape here.</b>

28:21.709 --> 28:23.077
<b>I think that throws it off.</b>

28:23.144 --> 28:24.612
<b>- I've got to go with Noelin</b>
<b>on this.</b>

28:24.679 --> 28:26.581
<b>- Yeah, I agree with that.</b>
<b>- Unanimous.</b>

28:26.647 --> 28:28.783
<b>Noelin, congratulations.</b>

28:31.152 --> 28:33.888
<b>Christian and Eva.</b>

28:33.955 --> 28:36.591
<b>- A little bit of the tattoo</b>
<b>goes in the armpit.</b>

28:36.657 --> 28:38.226
<b> <i>I think it was a smart choice</i> </b>

28:38.326 --> 28:40.328
<b> <i>due to the stretch</i> </b>
<b> <i>marks of the skin.</i> </b>

28:40.361 --> 28:42.063
<b>But Eva, as far as putting</b>

28:42.130 --> 28:44.332
<b> <i>this many concentric circles</i> </b>
<b> <i>on this area</i> </b>

28:44.365 --> 28:47.335
<b>of the body, I think might</b>
<b>not have been the right choice.</b>

28:47.401 --> 28:49.837
<b> <i>- This thing is</i> </b>
<b> <i>such a precise tool,</i> </b>

28:49.904 --> 28:53.007
<b>so the variances throughout</b>
<b>this thing are very obvious.</b>

28:53.074 --> 28:56.244
<b>- Christian, you immediately</b>
<b>thought a lot smarter.</b>

28:56.344 --> 28:59.046
<b> <i>You do yourself a favor</i> </b>
<b> <i>by offsetting that circle</i> </b>

28:59.113 --> 29:00.715
<b> <i>in those little placeholders.</i> </b>

29:00.782 --> 29:02.183
<b>Christian takes it.</b>

29:02.250 --> 29:04.018
<b>- It's simple, it's clean,</b>
<b>it's bold.</b>

29:04.085 --> 29:05.653
<b> <i>It comes across much cleaner.</i> </b>

29:05.720 --> 29:07.688
<b>The winner of this</b>
<b>head to head is Christian.</b>

29:07.755 --> 29:09.824
<b>Congratulations.</b>

29:12.126 --> 29:13.761
<b>Ulyss and Doom.</b>

29:15.129 --> 29:17.598
<b>Doom, did you design</b>
<b>both of these tattoos?</b>

29:17.665 --> 29:19.634
<b>- Our shop designed</b>
<b>both of them.</b>

29:19.700 --> 29:21.002
<b>- I drew the king.</b>
<b>- As a pair of tattoos,</b>

29:21.068 --> 29:22.637
<b>they work really well together.</b>

29:22.703 --> 29:24.071
<b> <i>- All right, Doom,</i> </b>
<b> <i>everywhere you have</i> </b>

29:24.138 --> 29:25.473
<b> <i>the fine lines in your design,</i> </b>

29:25.540 --> 29:27.208
<b> <i>it gets away from you,</i> </b>

29:27.308 --> 29:28.876
<b> <i>especially the fine detail</i> </b>
<b> <i>inside the crown,</i> </b>

29:28.943 --> 29:30.945
<b>and you lose it in the shape</b>
<b>of her face.</b>

29:31.012 --> 29:34.215
<b>- The sloping forehead</b>
<b>with the bulbous nose isn't</b>

29:34.315 --> 29:36.083
<b>the most attractive look</b>
<b>for this lady.</b>

29:36.150 --> 29:38.853
<b>Ulyss, I like this profile</b>
<b>much more.</b>

29:38.920 --> 29:40.621
<b> <i>Just that simple little variance</i> </b>

29:40.688 --> 29:43.458
<b>in the actual shape of the</b>
<b>profile's face changes the game.</b>

29:43.524 --> 29:45.660
<b> <i>- This one's a bit cleaner,</i> </b>
<b> <i>looks a little softer.</i> </b>

29:45.726 --> 29:47.962
<b>- Definitely hard to mess up</b>
<b>one of Erin's drawings.</b>

29:48.029 --> 29:51.332
<b>- My vote is for Ulyss.</b>
<b>- Ulyss, you take it.</b>

29:53.868 --> 29:56.604
<b>- Erin and Marvin.</b>

29:56.671 --> 29:58.372
<b>- I love both of these.</b>

29:58.439 --> 30:01.008
<b> <i>I think these have</i> </b>
<b> <i>a really great synergy together.</i> </b>

30:01.075 --> 30:03.177
<b>Marvin, it's got</b>
<b>the right color palette.</b>

30:03.244 --> 30:05.213
<b> <i>I really,</i> </b>
<b> <i>really love the richness</i> </b>

30:05.346 --> 30:07.115
<b> <i>that you have in the mouth,</i> </b>
<b> <i>coming from the underside</i> </b>

30:07.181 --> 30:09.117
<b> <i>of the tongue and the back</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the open mouth,</i> </b>

30:09.183 --> 30:11.986
<b> <i>and then how you just smoothly</i> </b>
<b> <i>move that black forward.</i> </b>

30:12.053 --> 30:14.555
<b>Crazy risky to try to blend</b>
<b>all this stuff out</b>

30:14.622 --> 30:15.823
<b>to the extent that you did.</b>

30:15.890 --> 30:17.325
<b>- Erin, you chose this one.</b>

30:17.391 --> 30:18.893
<b>- I just felt like it was</b>
<b>the one</b>

30:18.960 --> 30:20.928
<b>that was closest</b>
<b>to what I would do at home.</b>

30:20.995 --> 30:22.597
<b>I knew it was,</b>
<b>like, a massive risk.</b>

30:22.663 --> 30:24.365
<b>- Well, I think the risk</b>
<b>pays off.</b>

30:24.432 --> 30:26.434
<b> <i>What really shines in this is</i> </b>
<b> <i>the shading,</i> </b>

30:26.501 --> 30:28.770
<b> <i>the lips, the black</i> </b>
<b> <i>shading in the background,</i> </b>

30:28.836 --> 30:30.538
<b> <i>and the soft shading</i> </b>
<b> <i>in the teeth.</i> </b>

30:30.605 --> 30:32.940
<b>It gives the teeth</b>
<b>their tone and their contour.</b>

30:33.007 --> 30:35.209
<b>You totally kill it.</b>
<b>My vote is for Erin.</b>

30:35.309 --> 30:38.212
<b>- If I've got to pick,</b>
<b>Marvin, you really set the bar</b>

30:38.312 --> 30:40.715
<b>for where she had to work,</b>
<b>and I'm gonna give it to you.</b>

30:40.782 --> 30:44.819
<b>- There's a little bit</b>
<b>more contrast and readability</b>

30:44.886 --> 30:47.789
<b>in Marvin's tattoo, so for that</b>
<b>reason I'm going with Marvin.</b>

30:47.855 --> 30:50.324
<b>Winner of this head to head is</b>
<b>Marvin. Congratulations.</b>

30:50.324 --> 30:53.327
<b>- Thank you.</b>

30:53.361 --> 30:55.897
<b>- Tommy and Cleen.</b>

30:55.963 --> 30:59.700
<b>- You guys do match</b>
<b>in the sense of placement,</b>

30:59.767 --> 31:03.571
<b> <i>and they do have</i> </b>
<b> <i>the feel of the same artistry,</i> </b>

31:03.638 --> 31:06.340
<b>but Cleen, yours is</b>
<b>really technically solid.</b>

31:06.407 --> 31:09.110
<b>All the color here is really,</b>
<b>really bright, saturated.</b>

31:09.177 --> 31:12.280
<b> <i>I love the deep, solid</i> </b>
<b> <i>silhouette,</i> </b>

31:12.280 --> 31:13.915
<b> <i>the back side of the mouth,</i> </b>

31:13.981 --> 31:15.616
<b> <i>and the other teeth that</i> </b>
<b> <i>are behind in the front.</i> </b>

31:15.683 --> 31:18.152
<b>Very bold, very clean.</b>
<b>You nailed it, man.</b>

31:18.286 --> 31:20.288
<b>- Did you make any changes,</b>
<b>Tommy?</b>

31:20.288 --> 31:22.323
<b>- The drawing I got was a little</b>
<b>bit simpler than the other one,</b>

31:22.390 --> 31:24.292
<b>so I added a little</b>
<b>more texture to the face.</b>

31:24.292 --> 31:26.994
<b>- I don't feel like you look</b>
<b>as comfortable doing this style.</b>

31:27.061 --> 31:29.764
<b> <i>Think he gets you just a little</i> </b>
<b> <i>bit on some of the textures,</i> </b>

31:29.831 --> 31:30.998
<b> <i>and some of the color</i> </b>
<b> <i>highlights,</i> </b>

31:31.065 --> 31:32.333
<b> <i>and some of the blends.</i> </b>

31:32.400 --> 31:34.135
<b>My vote's for Cleen.</b>
<b>- I agree.</b>

31:34.202 --> 31:36.204
<b>I think Cleen edges out.</b>
<b>- Cleen, you get Tommy.</b>

31:36.304 --> 31:40.108
<b>- Congratulations,</b>
<b>Cleen, you win the head to head.</b>

31:44.512 --> 31:46.380
<b>All right, judges.</b>

31:46.447 --> 31:48.583
<b>Time to announce</b>
<b>best tattoos of the day.</b>

31:48.649 --> 31:51.352
<b>- How many teams won</b>
<b>both head to heads?</b>

31:51.419 --> 31:53.321
<b>- Basilica and Black Cobra.</b>

31:53.387 --> 31:57.024
<b>- I would go Matt and Katie</b>
<b>over Christian and Noelin.</b>

31:57.091 --> 32:01.028
<b> <i>Katie pulled off a really slick</i> </b>
<b> <i>tattoo, and I think that</i> </b>

32:01.095 --> 32:02.897
<b> <i>Matt, also, as far as technical</i> </b>
<b> <i>application,</i> </b>

32:02.964 --> 32:04.465
<b> <i>he held up really strong.</i> </b>

32:04.532 --> 32:07.135
<b>- Would you say that</b>
<b>one of these two tattoos</b>

32:07.201 --> 32:09.771
<b> <i>is the best</i> </b>
<b> <i>tattoo of the day?</i> </b>

32:09.837 --> 32:11.606
<b>- You wouldn't, what would you?</b>

32:11.672 --> 32:13.908
<b> <i>- Cleen's is really solid.</i> </b>
<b> <i>- And you know what?</i> </b>

32:13.975 --> 32:15.943
<b> <i>Aaron's is really good too,</i> </b>
<b> <i>just Katie beat him.</i> </b>

32:16.010 --> 32:17.779
<b> <i>So this is a win and a loss,</i> </b>

32:17.845 --> 32:21.282
<b>but Aaron's still looks like</b>
<b>a nice, solid, clean tattoo.</b>

32:21.315 --> 32:23.384
<b>- 100%. Win and a loss,</b>
<b>but top of the pack.</b>

32:23.451 --> 32:24.952
<b> <i>- Both tattoos</i> </b>
<b> <i>are really diverse</i> </b>

32:25.019 --> 32:26.387
<b> <i>coming out</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the same shop.</i> </b>

32:26.454 --> 32:29.157
<b>My vote is</b>
<b>for Golden Skull Tattoo.</b>

32:29.290 --> 32:31.492
<b>- My vote is for Black Cobra.</b>

32:31.559 --> 32:32.960
<b>- Chris?</b>

32:33.027 --> 32:34.429
<b>- Golden Skull.</b>

32:34.495 --> 32:36.831
<b>- The judges have decided</b>
<b>the best</b>

32:36.898 --> 32:39.834
<b>tattoos of the day go</b>
<b>to Golden Skull Tattoo.</b>

32:39.901 --> 32:42.503
<b>Artists, as the jury of peers,</b>

32:42.570 --> 32:46.707
<b>you must all deliberate and put</b>
<b>one shop up for elimination.</b>

32:46.774 --> 32:48.476
<b>Head back to the loft.</b>

32:53.614 --> 32:55.383
<b>- Are you guys</b>
<b>honestly gonna sit here</b>

32:55.450 --> 32:57.318
<b>and say Eva didn't have</b>
<b>the worst tattoo of the day?</b>

32:57.318 --> 32:59.120
<b>Why not back that up and just</b>

32:59.187 --> 33:00.721
<b>send the right person home,</b>
<b>then.</b>

33:00.788 --> 33:02.623
<b>- Because we're</b>
<b>in this silly alliance.</b>

33:02.690 --> 33:04.959
<b>- Where is that gonna</b>
<b>benefit you?</b>

33:05.026 --> 33:06.427
<b>- This is what I'm personally</b>

33:06.494 --> 33:08.329
<b>playing tug of war</b>
<b>within my head.</b>

33:08.362 --> 33:10.131
<b>At some points we're having</b>
<b>to back up [bleep] tattoos.</b>

33:10.264 --> 33:12.266
<b>- Then so why the [bleep]</b>
<b>bother with it at all?</b>

33:12.266 --> 33:13.935
<b>- We got here,</b>
<b>they had an alliance.</b>

33:14.001 --> 33:15.403
<b>And then one day,</b>

33:15.470 --> 33:17.038
<b>do you guys want to be in--</b>
<b>- Yeah, why?</b>

33:17.105 --> 33:18.806
<b>Because you're strong as [bleep]</b>

33:18.873 --> 33:21.509
<b>and they don't want you against</b>
<b>them! What a sucker play.</b>

33:21.576 --> 33:24.178
<b>Because you guys are one of</b>
<b>the toughest teams in the house.</b>

33:24.278 --> 33:26.147
<b>They don't want you going</b>
<b>against them, because</b>

33:26.280 --> 33:28.549
<b>you're gonna [bleep] help ride</b>
<b>them off to a hundred grand.</b>

33:28.616 --> 33:30.418
<b>- You know as well as I do,</b>
<b>though, dude,</b>

33:30.485 --> 33:32.286
<b>you guys have an alliance.</b>
<b>- We're not together.</b>

33:32.320 --> 33:34.489
<b>We all sat down and said,</b>
<b>this whole little alliance,</b>

33:34.555 --> 33:36.457
<b>let's bust it up.</b>
<b>But it's every man for himself.</b>

33:36.524 --> 33:38.626
<b>I'll go after Cleen,</b>
<b>I'll go after Katie and Matt.</b>

33:38.693 --> 33:42.430
<b>I don't give a [bleep] dude,</b>
<b>because I came with my alliance.</b>

33:45.982 --> 33:48.451
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

33:48.518 --> 33:53.056
<b>- We're here as the jury</b>
<b>of peers to determine which shop</b>

33:53.122 --> 33:54.591
<b>is gonna be put</b>
<b>up for elimination.</b>

33:54.657 --> 33:56.125
<b>- Allegory.</b>
<b>- Go ahead, tear it up.</b>

33:56.192 --> 33:58.127
<b>- The application</b>
<b>of the color is there,</b>

33:58.194 --> 34:00.730
<b> <i>but the top of the star looks</i> </b>
<b> <i>like it's poking out more,</i> </b>

34:00.797 --> 34:03.032
<b> <i>because the circle is</i> </b>
<b> <i>completely flat on top.</i> </b>

34:03.099 --> 34:05.068
<b>And you go to the top</b>
<b>of the yellow circle,</b>

34:05.134 --> 34:07.670
<b> <i>and it's completely different.</i> </b>
<b> <i>- I will say this.</i> </b>

34:07.737 --> 34:09.806
<b>If you take a compass</b>
<b>and you lean it towards you,</b>

34:09.873 --> 34:11.808
<b>those rings get smaller</b>
<b>as they go to the bottom.</b>

34:11.875 --> 34:14.844
<b>- I'm not talking about that.</b>
<b>Every circle is flat in spots.</b>

34:14.911 --> 34:18.380
<b>- Some of the circle lines,</b>
<b>because I did really go for it</b>

34:18.447 --> 34:21.251
<b>and give the canvas exactly</b>
<b>what he wanted,</b>

34:21.317 --> 34:23.085
<b> <i>I did line them up</i> </b>
<b> <i>so that there was</i> </b>

34:23.152 --> 34:26.856
<b> <i>a larger gap at the top</i> </b>
<b> <i>and a smaller gap at the bottom.</i> </b>

34:26.922 --> 34:29.391
<b>- I don't see where the</b>
<b>application in this is correct.</b>

34:29.458 --> 34:33.228
<b>- I do think if the technical</b>
<b>stuff in Eva's got called out,</b>

34:33.295 --> 34:35.264
<b>we should look at the technical</b>
<b>stuff in Christian's.</b>

34:35.331 --> 34:37.000
<b>- You just rib it up and let</b>
<b>me know when you're done.</b>

34:37.065 --> 34:38.902
<b> <i>- I mean,</i> </b>
<b> <i>I can see inconsistencies</i> </b>

34:38.967 --> 34:40.870
<b> <i>in some of the longitude lines.</i> </b>

34:40.937 --> 34:44.806
<b> <i>Base of the globe, one line</i> </b>
<b> <i>is straight, one line is curved.</i> </b>

34:44.873 --> 34:46.943
<b>- No matter what anybody</b>
<b>says to you, guys,</b>

34:47.043 --> 34:48.210
<b>there's a [bleep]</b>
<b>defense for it.</b>

34:48.277 --> 34:49.946
<b>- If you can't see the technical</b>

34:50.045 --> 34:52.114
<b>problems in your tattoos,</b>
<b>then you're having problems.</b>

34:52.181 --> 34:56.219
<b>- Rope me down. [bleep] do it.</b>
<b>- I definitely will.</b>

34:56.286 --> 34:58.855
<b>- All right,</b>
<b>today we're testing placement.</b>

34:58.922 --> 35:00.790
<b>Shop versus shop,</b>
<b>and the artists</b>

35:00.857 --> 35:02.659
<b>had to swap out canvases.</b>

35:02.725 --> 35:05.061
<b>A lot of things</b>
<b>to consider today.</b>

35:05.061 --> 35:06.462
<b>- We see a lot of shop unity</b>
<b>where</b>

35:06.529 --> 35:07.697
<b>both tattoos are very strong.</b>

35:07.764 --> 35:09.399
<b>But there are a few teams</b>

35:09.465 --> 35:11.467
<b>that the divide is</b>
<b>becoming more and more evident.</b>

35:11.534 --> 35:12.936
<b>- Nowhere else was it</b>
<b>more evident</b>

35:13.069 --> 35:14.571
<b>than with Unkindness Art.</b>

35:14.637 --> 35:16.873
<b>There's some weaknesses</b>
<b>in Doom Kitten's tattoo</b>

35:16.940 --> 35:18.875
<b>that make it one of the weakest</b>
<b>ones of the day for me.</b>

35:18.942 --> 35:20.643
<b> <i>There's a little bit</i> </b>
<b> <i>of rough areas,</i> </b>

35:20.710 --> 35:22.512
<b> <i>and saturation issues,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and blending issues.</i> </b>

35:22.579 --> 35:23.947
<b>But we all agree</b>
<b>Erin's tattoo is great.</b>

35:24.080 --> 35:25.648
<b> <i>- Amazing.</i> </b>
<b> <i>- I love it.</i> </b>

35:25.715 --> 35:28.084
<b>- So does she save them</b>
<b>from being in the bottom?</b>

35:28.151 --> 35:29.652
<b>- I was surprised at how easy</b>

35:29.719 --> 35:31.921
<b>both of you</b>
<b>took it on that compass.</b>

35:31.988 --> 35:34.257
<b> <i>- There's a lot</i> </b>
<b> <i>of problems with Eva's tattoo.</i> </b>

35:34.324 --> 35:36.159
<b> <i>She gave herself</i> </b>
<b> <i>a tough challenge</i> </b>

35:36.226 --> 35:38.094
<b> <i>with all these</i> </b>
<b> <i>concentric circles.</i> </b>

35:38.127 --> 35:41.764
<b>- Allegory Arts has been riding</b>
<b>the middle of the pack.</b>

35:41.831 --> 35:45.201
<b>Old Town Ink find themselves</b>
<b>with two losses today.</b>

35:45.268 --> 35:47.170
<b>- For me, what made</b>
<b>DJ's fall short,</b>

35:47.237 --> 35:50.607
<b> <i>it's like a silly drawing</i> </b>
<b> <i>instead of a tough Oni mask.</i> </b>

35:50.673 --> 35:52.575
<b>And if you just look at it,</b>
<b>it's crooked.</b>

35:52.642 --> 35:55.178
<b>With Bubba's tattoo,</b>
<b>placement is bad.</b>

35:55.245 --> 35:57.580
<b>Legibility is a problem.</b>
<b>- They had an off day.</b>

35:57.647 --> 36:01.050
<b>- So, great artists are</b>
<b>going home no matter what.</b>

36:01.117 --> 36:04.187
<b>And we have yet to see who the</b>
<b>artists put up for elimination.</b>

36:04.254 --> 36:06.222
<b>- It's gonna be interesting.</b>
<b>- Let's get them down here</b>

36:06.289 --> 36:08.191
<b>and see what happens.</b>

36:14.597 --> 36:16.199
<b>- All right, jury of peers.</b>

36:16.266 --> 36:18.067
<b>Who are you sending</b>
<b>down for elimination?</b>

36:18.134 --> 36:19.602
<b>- The jury of peers has voted</b>

36:19.669 --> 36:22.772
<b>that Allegory Arts</b>
<b>go down for elimination.</b>

36:22.839 --> 36:26.276
<b>- All right. In the bottom,</b>
<b>we'll see Allegory Arts,</b>

36:26.342 --> 36:29.078
<b>Old Town Ink,</b>

36:29.112 --> 36:31.548
<b>and Unkindness Arts.</b>

36:31.614 --> 36:33.416
<b>We'll see everybody downstairs.</b>

36:33.483 --> 36:35.819
<b>- This is our first time</b>
<b>really in the bottom.</b>

36:35.885 --> 36:37.420
<b>I mean, we're obviously</b>
<b>gonna defend ourselves.</b>

36:37.487 --> 36:39.088
<b>- I'll defend myself,</b>
<b>but I'm not gonna</b>

36:39.122 --> 36:40.957
<b>throw you guys under the bus</b>
<b>to defend myself.</b>

36:41.090 --> 36:43.426
<b>We're too [bleep] far in the</b>
<b>game to do that kind of [bleep].</b>

36:43.493 --> 36:45.028
<b>- All right, let's go.</b>

36:55.738 --> 36:57.240
<b>- This week,</b>
<b>you had to tattoo</b>

36:57.307 --> 36:59.142
<b>coordinating armpit tattoos.</b>

36:59.209 --> 37:03.046
<b>Based on your work, one shop</b>
<b>will be packing their machines.</b>

37:03.079 --> 37:04.714
<b>Let's go to the jury of peers.</b>

37:04.781 --> 37:06.349
<b>You voted Allegory Arts</b>
<b>to the bottom.</b>

37:06.416 --> 37:08.184
<b>Why'd you make that decision,</b>
<b>Christian?</b>

37:08.251 --> 37:10.487
<b>- I think it was mostly</b>
<b>just based on Eva's tattoo.</b>

37:10.553 --> 37:12.489
<b>- Was this a unanimous vote?</b>
<b>- No.</b>

37:12.555 --> 37:14.824
<b>- Allegory voted for us</b>
<b>as spite.</b>

37:14.891 --> 37:16.593
<b>- No, not out of spite.</b>

37:16.659 --> 37:18.461
<b>I noticed a lot</b>
<b>of technical flaws</b>

37:18.528 --> 37:20.630
<b>in Christian's piece as well.</b>
<b>- Your tattoo is</b>

37:20.697 --> 37:22.298
<b>a little more challenged</b>
<b>than Christian's, Eva.</b>

37:22.365 --> 37:24.200
<b>The biggest problems with</b>
<b>these tattoos</b>

37:24.267 --> 37:26.936
<b>were your decisions</b>
<b>on what to attempt.</b>

37:27.070 --> 37:28.738
<b>- Eva, if you'd tried</b>
<b>to do an Olympic ring tattoo</b>

37:28.805 --> 37:30.206
<b>in the center of a guy's armpit,</b>

37:30.273 --> 37:32.075
<b>you'd have been</b>
<b>a little bit better off.</b>

37:32.075 --> 37:35.378
<b>But Ulyss, definitely the best</b>
<b>tattoo you've done here.</b>

37:36.913 --> 37:38.815
<b>- Unkindness Art.</b>
<b>- You know how</b>

37:38.882 --> 37:40.350
<b>I feel about your tattoo, Erin.</b>
<b>I think it's great.</b>

37:40.416 --> 37:42.085
<b> <i>Technically slick as [bleep].</i> </b>

37:42.118 --> 37:44.687
<b>The biggest problem</b>
<b>with Doom Kitten's tattoo</b>

37:44.754 --> 37:47.790
<b> <i>is the loss of translation</i> </b>
<b> <i>from the drawing to the face.</i> </b>

37:47.857 --> 37:51.094
<b>You didn't follow that stencil</b>
<b>perfectly with the needle,</b>

37:51.161 --> 37:53.463
<b>and that's what, I think,</b>
<b>happened to the face too.</b>

37:53.530 --> 37:56.132
<b>- It's true that he does</b>
<b>have some more tricks to learn,</b>

37:56.199 --> 37:57.767
<b>but he is a fantastic artist,</b>

37:57.834 --> 37:59.602
<b>and he is a good tattooer.</b>

37:59.669 --> 38:02.205
<b>And I think that the fault</b>
<b>in our team is the fact</b>

38:02.272 --> 38:06.609
<b>that I haven't be able to find</b>
<b>the middle ground, not him.</b>

38:06.676 --> 38:09.179
<b>- You guys are together.</b>
<b>You did this team thing.</b>

38:09.245 --> 38:10.780
<b>Suck it up,</b>
<b>and start making some</b>

38:10.847 --> 38:12.916
<b>tattoos that you do believe in.</b>

38:13.049 --> 38:14.551
<b>- Old Town Ink.</b>

38:14.617 --> 38:16.319
<b> <i>- Bubba, the decision</i> </b>
<b> <i>of how to do this</i> </b>

38:16.386 --> 38:17.487
<b> <i>background killed</i> </b>
<b> <i>this tattoo for me.</i> </b>

38:17.554 --> 38:18.721
<b>And then DJ,</b>

38:18.788 --> 38:20.156
<b> <i>is it wacky, is it new school,</i> </b>

38:20.223 --> 38:22.292
<b> <i>is it Japanese?</i> </b>
<b>It has no home.</b>

38:22.358 --> 38:23.960
<b>- Your guys' two tattoos are</b>

38:24.060 --> 38:26.362
<b>not bad tattoos,</b>
<b>they just don't work for today.</b>

38:26.429 --> 38:27.964
<b>Don't leave questions.</b>

38:28.064 --> 38:29.699
<b>Just do what the thing's</b>
<b>supposed to look like.</b>

38:29.766 --> 38:31.100
<b>- It's crazy, you know?</b>

38:31.167 --> 38:33.503
<b>We have two losses,</b>
<b>two losses,</b>

38:33.570 --> 38:34.704
<b>a win and a loss.</b>

38:34.771 --> 38:36.940
<b>But on a standalone basis,</b>

38:37.073 --> 38:38.608
<b>most everybody here excelled.</b>

38:38.675 --> 38:42.312
<b>So this is gonna be</b>
<b>a really tough elimination.</b>

38:42.378 --> 38:44.113
<b>I need a final decision.</b>

38:44.180 --> 38:47.283
<b>- Since we stopped bringing</b>
<b>people back in this competition,</b>

38:47.350 --> 38:49.018
<b>it's starting to shed</b>
<b>a little light</b>

38:49.018 --> 38:50.687
<b>into who is gonna go further.</b>

38:50.753 --> 38:52.222
<b>And honestly, Allegory Arts,</b>
<b>you've been struggling.</b>

38:52.288 --> 38:54.290
<b>You've had some ups and downs.</b>

38:54.357 --> 38:56.726
<b>The middle of the pack</b>
<b>that you've been running in is</b>

38:56.793 --> 38:58.495
<b>now been whittled down</b>
<b>to the bottom of the pack,</b>

38:58.561 --> 39:01.030
<b>and that's where I'm leaning.</b>
<b>- Chris?</b>

39:01.064 --> 39:03.466
<b>- These whole different</b>
<b>mixes that went down today</b>

39:03.533 --> 39:06.035
<b>make for big curve balls</b>
<b>in this competition.</b>

39:06.069 --> 39:07.904
<b>Ulyss, you had a great</b>
<b>drawing to work off.</b>

39:08.037 --> 39:09.906
<b>I think this is</b>
<b>the best tattoo you did.</b>

39:10.039 --> 39:11.441
<b>But I think as a team,</b>
<b>you guys mirror some</b>

39:11.508 --> 39:13.343
<b>of your good habits</b>
<b>putting in color,</b>

39:13.409 --> 39:15.044
<b>and some of your bad</b>
<b>habits with your liners.</b>

39:15.044 --> 39:17.313
<b>When we're getting</b>
<b>down to the nitty gritty,</b>

39:17.380 --> 39:19.282
<b>there's no room for error.</b>

39:19.349 --> 39:20.817
<b>My vote's for you guys.</b>

39:20.884 --> 39:24.320
<b>My vote as well.</b>
<b>The judges have decided.</b>

39:24.387 --> 39:28.358
<b>Allegory Arts, you do not have</b>
<b>what it takes to be Master Shop.</b>

39:28.424 --> 39:32.795
<b>- I think you guys have a great</b>
<b>team, a great shop aesthetic.</b>

39:32.862 --> 39:35.064
<b>You work well together.</b>
<b>I love your energy.</b>

39:35.064 --> 39:36.766
<b>- Stay strong, man.</b>
<b>Keep going.</b>

39:36.833 --> 39:39.302
<b>- Please pack your machines</b>
<b>and move out.</b>

39:39.369 --> 39:41.437
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>- Take care.</b>

39:41.504 --> 39:45.141
<b>- Love you guys.</b>
<b>- Love you guys.</b>

39:45.208 --> 39:48.645
<b> <i>- I really</i> </b>
<b> <i>regret that we didn't win.</i> </b>

39:48.711 --> 39:52.182
<b>I also regret that I didn't</b>
<b>punch Christian in the face.</b>

39:52.248 --> 39:54.184
<b>I'm super, super proud of you.</b>

39:54.250 --> 39:58.788
<b>I'm super glad that we did this,</b>

<b>You're my best friend,</b>
<b>and I'm really glad</b>

40:02.392 --> 40:04.427

<b>Came in hand in hand,</b>

<b> <i>announcer: On the next episode</i> </b>
