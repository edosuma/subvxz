00:42.792 --> 00:47.917
DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS

01:39.876 --> 01:46.376
The 7.55 express for Bradley will be
leaving in five minutes from platform 3.

01:47.501 --> 01:53.751
The 7.55 express for Bradley will be
leaving in five minutes from platform 3.

02:32.292 --> 02:38.501
The 7.55 express for Bradley will be
leaving in four minutes from platform 3.

02:40.667 --> 02:45.501
The 7.55 express for Bradley will be
leaving in four minutes from platform 3.

02:46.042 --> 02:47.126
Excuse me ...

02:52.376 --> 02:53.501
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:21.251 --> 03:22.584
Oh, sorry.

03:43.292 --> 03:47.459
Pardon me. I think there is room
for one more in here, is there not?

03:47.542 --> 03:49.001
Yes, right here.

03:49.042 --> 03:50.376
Oh, thank you.

03:53.876 --> 03:56.292
I'm so sorry to disturb you.
- Oh, that's all right.

03:56.376 --> 03:57.459
Thank you.

03:59.542 --> 04:00.626
Thank you.

05:29.501 --> 05:31.917
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:33.209 --> 05:39.084
Thank you so much. Thank you.

05:41.209 --> 05:45.417
Hey, that's a funny looking deck, man.
How do you play poker with these?

05:47.126 --> 05:49.042
They're tarot cards.

05:49.167 --> 05:51.167
You are familiar with the tarot?

05:51.501 --> 05:53.917
I wouldn't say that. But
I've seen the cards before.

05:54.917 --> 05:58.459
Doctor Schreck. Doctor of Metaphysics?

05:58.501 --> 06:02.751
The science which investigates the first principles of nature and thought.

06:02.917 --> 06:04.417
And nonsense.

06:04.709 --> 06:09.792
Schreck is a German word, isn't it?
Means fright, fear, something like that.

06:09.917 --> 06:13.001
A more exact translation
would be terror.

06:13.584 --> 06:17.126
An unfortunate misnomer
for I am the mildest of men.

06:17.542 --> 06:21.917
However, I sometimes foretell
things that are frightening.

06:23.001 --> 06:24.126
With these?

06:24.459 --> 06:26.834
They are the key, yes.

06:28.501 --> 06:29.501
The key?

06:30.376 --> 06:31.501
The key to what?

06:31.834 --> 06:33.542
Ancient wisdom.

06:34.167 --> 06:39.334
The tarot deck is a picture book of
life, an answer to the deepest questions

06:39.417 --> 06:44.417
of philosophy and history, and
sometimes a means of prediction.

06:45.084 --> 06:46.501
Fortune telling?

06:46.917 --> 06:48.376
Of a kind.

06:49.501 --> 06:50.709
What kind?

06:51.292 --> 06:57.376
There is within each of us a twin
destiny: the natural and the supernatural.

06:57.501 --> 07:01.459
The cards are attracted to the
supernatural part of that destiny

07:01.542 --> 07:04.584
as one pole of a magnet
attracts an opposite pole.

07:04.709 --> 07:06.542
Supernatural part?

07:06.667 --> 07:12.792
The strange, the weird, the unknown,
the terrifying, the mysterious.

07:13.501 --> 07:18.751
At one time or another during our lives
we may, any one of us, encounter it.

07:19.501 --> 07:26.042
This deck can forewarn us.
I call it my House of Horrors.

07:28.501 --> 07:29.834
How does it work?

07:30.001 --> 07:35.667
The person, whose fortune is to be
told, touches the cards three times.

07:37.834 --> 07:43.501
Then they are shuffled and dealt. The
first four cards predict his destiny.

07:43.626 --> 07:47.501
The fifth gives him the
knowledge to change it . If

07:48.376 --> 07:50.167
change is possible.

07:50.834 --> 07:53.876
Really, do we have to
suffer all this nonsense?

07:54.667 --> 07:56.251
There's no harm in it.

07:56.334 --> 08:01.501
Astrologers, spiritualists,
table-rappers, the entire lunatic fringe.

08:01.584 --> 08:05.084
They have been exposed for the
charlatans they are, over and over again.

08:05.209 --> 08:08.459
I don't know. I don't know. A gypsy
once told me I was going to get

08:08.459 --> 08:12.834
an unexpected gift. That very day I walked under a pigeon...

08:14.501 --> 08:19.626
The tarot deck is a serious matter.
The cards predict the truth.

08:19.751 --> 08:22.792
The supernatural truth. Always!

08:22.917 --> 08:25.209
Anybody, who believes that,
will believe anything.

08:25.876 --> 08:28.251
Perhaps you would like
to learn your future?

08:28.334 --> 08:30.584
Just tap the cards.

08:33.333 --> 08:36.876
I must warn you, gentlemen. This is
undoubtedly a well rehearsed prelude

08:36.876 --> 08:40.958
to some shabby confidence trick. You can fool all these others as much

08:41.001 --> 08:44.334
as you please, Doctor, but kindly leave me out of it.

08:46.167 --> 08:47.584
How about me?

08:48.042 --> 08:49.709
Come on. I'm game.

08:49.792 --> 08:51.626
You are not afraid?

08:51.709 --> 08:54.667
Well, if it's going to happen to me
anyway, what's there to be afraid of?

08:55.084 --> 08:56.334
Very well.

08:59.251 --> 09:01.709
Tap the cards three times.

09:11.709 --> 09:13.876
I do not manipulate them.

09:14.292 --> 09:21.167
They use my hands to manipulate
themselves and to present your destiny.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.167
The Chariot.

09:29.334 --> 09:31.167
The High Priestess.

09:33.084 --> 09:34.417
The Moon.

09:35.751 --> 09:37.542
The Enchantress.

09:39.667 --> 09:44.917
Fine. Yes. Yes, you do that.

09:45.792 --> 09:48.126
I will. Goodbye.

09:50.042 --> 09:52.459
Oh, how they talk! You busy?

09:52.751 --> 09:54.584
Yes, I'm working on
the Morrison project.

09:54.709 --> 09:56.042
Well, there's no rush for that.

09:56.126 --> 09:59.667
This letter came this morning from that
Biddulph woman you sold your house to.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.126
She wants to make some major structure alterations

10:02.251 --> 10:05.209
and seems to think you're the
only architect to deal with it.

10:13.834 --> 10:16.042
Doesn't say what the alterations are.

10:16.167 --> 10:17.292
Does it matter?

10:17.417 --> 10:20.084
A lonely widow, rich, beautiful

10:20.209 --> 10:22.917
Well, I'd be glad to spend a few
days on that island with her myself.

10:51.501 --> 10:52.792
Thank you, sir.

11:15.292 --> 11:16.376
Hey.

11:17.209 --> 11:19.292
Hey, if it's not Mr. Jamie

11:19.417 --> 11:20.417
Caleb!

11:20.501 --> 11:22.042
How good to see you.

11:22.167 --> 11:23.501
I didn't expect you back, sir.

11:23.584 --> 11:25.459
Well, Mrs. Biddulph
wrote and asked me to give

11:25.501 --> 11:28.667
her advice about altering the house.
Is anyone at home, d'you know?

11:29.376 --> 11:30.709
My grand-daughter, Valda

11:30.834 --> 11:33.084
Ah, Valda, is the mistress in?

11:33.459 --> 11:35.459
Upstairs, Grandfather.

11:36.542 --> 11:37.542
Come in.

11:45.501 --> 11:48.501
You were about this
high the last time I saw you.

11:54.209 --> 11:58.667
Oh, Mr. Dawson, how wonderful. I had
no idea you would be here so soon.

11:58.792 --> 12:01.501
I was free and naturally I
was interested in the house.

12:01.626 --> 12:04.584
I'm very grateful to you, by the way,
for calling in my firm for the job.

12:04.626 --> 12:07.334
Oh Valda, will you prepare the guest room for Mr Dawson, please?

12:07.417 --> 12:08.584
Come in here.

12:17.751 --> 12:21.876
It doesn't seem to have changed very
much. What exactly do you want clone?

12:22.001 --> 12:24.417
Oh, what I want principally
is to have that wall knocked down

12:24.417 --> 12:26.876
to make one large room.
You know like a ballroom.

12:27.459 --> 12:29.334
There shouldn't be any
problems, should it?

12:29.417 --> 12:32.751
No. No, I don't think so.

12:33.584 --> 12:36.292
But it's an old house. I'd want
to examine it very carefully

12:36.292 --> 12:37.542
before I make up my mind.

12:37.751 --> 12:40.001
Well, I thought you'd know
it better than anyone else.

12:40.417 --> 12:41.501
Yes, I should.

12:43.251 --> 12:47.292
My family lived here for
centuries before I had to sell it.

12:49.834 --> 12:51.001
But still

12:51.292 --> 12:53.792
I think I'd better look at
the foundations and the walls

12:53.792 --> 12:57.834
very carefully before we decide
to make any radical changes.

12:58.126 --> 13:00.584
Well, I have to go down to
the village for an hour or so.

13:00.667 --> 13:03.376
If there's anything you want,
just ask Caleb or Valda.

13:15.292 --> 13:17.167
May I ask you a personal question?

13:18.126 --> 13:19.709
If it's not too personal.

13:22.251 --> 13:27.751
Why does a beautiful woman like yourself
want to bury herself in the Hebrides?

13:29.084 --> 13:32.792
My husband was a very wonderful man.

13:34.376 --> 13:36.792
It took me a long time
to get over his death.

13:38.459 --> 13:42.167
In fact, after the funeral
I had a sort of breakdown.

13:43.834 --> 13:47.167
The doctors decided that I
needed complete rest and quiet.

13:48.876 --> 13:50.334
So I came here.

13:52.501 --> 13:56.834
But now you've decided you want
to rejoin the human race, aye?

13:57.542 --> 13:59.001
Why do you say that?

13:59.126 --> 14:01.459
Well, you're having this
room made into a ballroom.

14:02.626 --> 14:04.292
That's not for entertaining.

14:05.376 --> 14:06.917
You see my husband was an archeologist.

14:08.126 --> 14:11.792
He had a large collection of very
valuable specimens from all over the world.

14:13.251 --> 14:17.501
I intend to turn this into a
sort of museum to his memory.

14:18.292 --> 14:22.709
It's a beautiful house, and you're
welcome to visit us any time.

14:23.417 --> 14:24.501
Thank you.

14:27.292 --> 14:28.376
What was that?

14:29.084 --> 14:30.584
I didn't hear anything.

15:57.917 --> 15:59.001
Valda!

16:03.792 --> 16:04.876
Valda!

16:05.376 --> 16:06.542
Yes, sir.

16:07.792 --> 16:11.626
Oh, I'm sorry to bother you, but d'you
know where the key to the cellar is?

16:11.751 --> 16:13.501
No, sir, I don't.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.792
Well, would you be good enough to
ask your grandfather if he knows?

16:18.709 --> 16:20.084
Yes, sir.

16:39.459 --> 16:41.584
The lock's been oiled recently.

16:43.126 --> 16:46.792
That's strange. I didn’t do it.

16:50.167 --> 16:51.584
Here is the torch for you.

17:59.251 --> 18:00.542
Caleb.

18:00.626 --> 18:01.667
Aye.

18:02.084 --> 18:03.459
Come down here, will you?

18:18.834 --> 18:20.709
Caleb, do you know what this is?

18:24.459 --> 18:27.626
Must be the coffin of Cosmo Waldemar.

18:28.667 --> 18:32.584
The werewolf! Over two
hundred years ago

18:32.667 --> 18:35.626
Cosmo Waldemar claimed that
this house was really his

18:36.292 --> 18:39.001
and that my ancestors
had stolen it from him.

18:39.626 --> 18:41.917
And he vowed that one day he'd return.

18:42.417 --> 18:46.376
He swore that his place would be
taken by whoever owned the house

18:47.209 --> 18:50.876
and that he himself would
once again assume human shape.

18:52.126 --> 18:53.876
His grave was never found.

18:55.292 --> 18:57.084
But it was here

18:57.209 --> 18:59.501
in the walls of this cellar

18:59.584 --> 19:01.876
for all this time.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.167
Not all this time.

19:05.667 --> 19:07.626
This plaster is new.

19:11.501 --> 19:14.501
I'm going to find out
what's in that coffin.

19:14.792 --> 19:16.792
Come on. Give me a hand.

19:50.542 --> 19:53.001
We'll need something stronger than this.

19:54.584 --> 19:55.876
Come on.

21:24.876 --> 21:26.251
Oh, Mrs. Biddulph.

21:26.751 --> 21:28.626
Did you see anything
come out of the house?

21:30.001 --> 21:32.334
No. What's the matter?

21:33.417 --> 21:36.292
Nothing. Here let me give
you a hand with those.

21:36.376 --> 21:37.584
Oh, thank you.

21:40.126 --> 21:43.126
The only thing I don't like about
living on this island is the fact

21:43.126 --> 21:44.626
that the shops won't deliver...

21:44.834 --> 21:46.542
Oh, put them down there, will you?

21:49.292 --> 21:51.126
Oh, I see you've found the key.

21:51.501 --> 21:54.334
No, no. Caleb had a spare one.

21:55.126 --> 21:56.834
Will you have to work down there?

21:57.001 --> 21:58.709
Eh, yes, yes, I think so.

21:59.251 --> 22:01.501
Well, how long do you
suppose the work will take?

22:01.876 --> 22:03.917
Just a short time, Mrs. Biddulph.

22:05.084 --> 22:07.417
Has anyone been down in
the cellar since you moved in?

22:08.626 --> 22:14.084
Well, I suppose the workmen
were down there. I haven't. Why?

22:15.751 --> 22:17.084
It doesn't matter.

24:21.501 --> 24:25.501
Go up to your room and
lock your door. Go on.

24:27.584 --> 24:30.751
Caleb, what does the legend say?

24:30.876 --> 24:34.834
That Cosmo would return and take his
revenge on the owner of the house.

24:34.917 --> 24:38.667
Do you know that Valda left me a note
tonight, saying she had to see me?

24:39.251 --> 24:41.001
She knew something about

24:41.917 --> 24:43.501
Do you have a gun?

24:43.584 --> 24:44.751
Aye.

24:45.459 --> 24:46.501
Get it.

24:50.251 --> 24:51.542
What are you going to do?

24:53.459 --> 24:55.584
Something came out of
that coffin tonight.

24:56.501 --> 24:58.876
Something evil and strange.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.501
I don't know why it killed Valda.

25:04.584 --> 25:06.459
But I know who it's going to kill.

25:07.542 --> 25:10.459
My great grandfather had this
made of the silver sword

25:10.459 --> 25:11.917
that killed Cosmo.

25:12.126 --> 25:14.542
It's hung in the house
ever since to protect it.

25:15.459 --> 25:20.001
I'm going to melt it down and
make bullets, silver bullets.

25:22.334 --> 25:26.751
And when that coffin opens
tomorrow night, I'll be waiting.

25:59.126 --> 26:00.417
Come in.

26:21.917 --> 26:23.584
I don't understand it.

26:26.501 --> 26:29.376
The legend says the only
way to kill a werewolf

26:30.501 --> 26:32.626
is with a bullet made
from a silver crucifix.

26:34.376 --> 26:35.542
I had six.

26:36.084 --> 26:39.042
You mean these?

26:45.501 --> 26:49.667
You see, what the legend really
says is that Cosmo Waldemar will

26:49.667 --> 26:53.584
resume human shape again when
he's replaced in his coffin.

26:53.792 --> 26:59.334
Not by the owner of the house, but by
a descendant of the man, who killed him.

26:59.751 --> 27:02.334
Now any dutiful wife

27:02.417 --> 27:05.667
would do anything to bring
her husband back to life.

27:06.501 --> 27:09.334
Even after two hundred years.

27:14.376 --> 27:16.709
Are you trying to tell me
that's going to happen to me?

27:17.126 --> 27:19.251
Where are you going now?

27:20.501 --> 27:21.542
Bradley.

27:21.626 --> 27:22.917
And then?

27:24.792 --> 27:27.751
To the Island of Unga in the Hebrides.

27:31.251 --> 27:32.834
Turn the fifth card.

27:39.251 --> 27:40.792
Well, what was it?

27:41.167 --> 27:42.334
Nothing.

27:43.542 --> 27:46.667
Come on, show me that card. Tell me.

27:47.417 --> 27:50.876
Don't be so gullible. Can't you
see it's all part of the act?

27:51.626 --> 27:54.084
What act, Mr. Marsh?

27:55.084 --> 27:56.709
Is your name Marsh?

27:56.792 --> 27:58.542
Don't be mislead by his knowing that.

27:58.667 --> 28:00.709
There's no magic about
it. I can assure you.

28:00.834 --> 28:02.709
Yeah, but how did he know?

28:02.834 --> 28:04.376
Maybe it's on his baggage.

28:04.876 --> 28:07.001
There's no mystery about it, gentlemen.

28:07.126 --> 28:11.459
Most informed people have heard
of Franklyn Marsh, art critic.

28:12.709 --> 28:16.501
Confidence tricksters make a point of
being familiar with people in the news.

28:19.126 --> 28:20.876
Well, I've never heard of you.

28:23.459 --> 28:24.834
Dr. Schreck,

28:25.709 --> 28:29.209
I'd like to try those
cards if you don't mind.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.042
If you think so.

28:39.292 --> 28:42.334
And now your prediction.

28:46.001 --> 28:48.334
You are going on holiday soon?

28:49.167 --> 28:52.501
Alone?
- With your wife and your daughter.

28:53.042 --> 28:55.126
Who told you? How did you know?

28:55.251 --> 28:58.292
Perfectly simple. He saw
the doll up on the rack.

28:58.542 --> 29:00.209
And a dog.

29:01.542 --> 29:04.292
That's right. You'll see them
all when we get to Bradley.

29:04.376 --> 29:05.751
They're meeting me at the station.

29:10.084 --> 29:16.501
And when you return from
holiday and when you return.

29:30.917 --> 29:32.667
I've got Katie, Mummy.

29:36.209 --> 29:38.167
Bill?
- Yeah.

29:39.042 --> 29:40.792
Bill, come and look at this.

29:47.876 --> 29:49.667
It wasn't there before.

29:50.917 --> 29:52.501
It must have grown while we were away.

29:55.709 --> 29:59.751
Well, you'd better get rid of it,
or it'll kill all the hydrangeas.

30:01.209 --> 30:03.792
Not even home yet and
back to work already.

30:43.292 --> 30:44.376
Au!

30:44.501 --> 30:45.626
What is it?

30:48.209 --> 30:49.459
What is it?

30:50.626 --> 30:52.084
Bill?

30:53.459 --> 30:56.792
It seemed to cry out
in pain when I hit it.

30:57.251 --> 31:00.417
And I couldn't cut into it
with a hoe. Give me the shears.

31:08.501 --> 31:11.709
I could almost swear that vine
pushed those shears out of my hands.

31:13.292 --> 31:15.792
Have you ever seen anything
like this before, Gerry?

31:16.876 --> 31:22.209
No, it's new to me. You say this
vine seemed actually to resist cutting?

31:22.334 --> 31:24.667
Well, I'm pretty good
at handling garden tools.

31:24.751 --> 31:26.917
I don't think those shears slipped.

31:28.667 --> 31:30.542
Can you put me up for a few days?

31:30.626 --> 31:31.376
Hm. Sure.

31:31.459 --> 31:33.792
Easier to find out what this
is all about on the spot.

31:33.876 --> 31:36.209
Better than staring through some
wretched microscope here at the Ministry.

31:36.251 --> 31:37.376
Too true.

31:37.501 --> 31:39.209
Come on, raise up

31:43.751 --> 31:45.834
Rusty, come on.
Come on, Rusty.

31:52.667 --> 31:54.876
Oh Rusty, come on.

31:56.042 --> 31:57.459
Rusty, go on, fetch it.

32:01.417 --> 32:02.417
Fetch it!

32:03.084 --> 32:06.042
I'm sorry, Mr. Drake.
- That's all right. Here you are.

32:06.542 --> 32:08.584
Come on, Rusty

32:12.667 --> 32:14.042
Come on, Rusty.

32:17.209 --> 32:19.376
Come on. Come on. Raise up

32:28.542 --> 32:30.001
Rusty.

32:31.126 --> 32:32.417
Carol!

32:32.876 --> 32:33.917
Yes, mummy?

32:34.042 --> 32:35.751
Time for tea. I'll get
Rusty's in a minute.

32:35.876 --> 32:38.709
All right. Rusty, go after it, go after it!

33:12.126 --> 33:14.292
A dog strangled by a vine.

33:16.251 --> 33:17.792
I can hardly believe it.

33:18.501 --> 33:21.542
A plant that protects itself.
It's impossible.

33:21.626 --> 33:24.667
Hm. That's what I thought at
first, but have a look at this.

33:25.209 --> 33:29.417
Now these are the main groups of plants
of whose existence we already now know.

33:29.501 --> 33:34.834
First: plants without roots,
stems or leaves, bacteria,

33:35.042 --> 33:38.167
and lichens.

33:39.751 --> 33:40.876
Fungi

33:44.417 --> 33:46.459
After that: mosses.

33:46.542 --> 33:50.876
A slightly higher form with
neither roots nor vascular tissue.

33:51.834 --> 33:57.459
Third: ferns which have roots and
vascular tissue but no flowers.

33:58.834 --> 34:01.334
And fourth: a flowering plant.

34:02.417 --> 34:05.334
They have roots, stems, leaves,

34:05.417 --> 34:09.501
vascular tissue and flowers
to help spread their seeds.

34:10.417 --> 34:12.001
Finally the

34:12.126 --> 34:13.626
Just one second.

34:14.126 --> 34:17.083
They're what we call the
insectivorous plants. The borderline

34:17.208 --> 34:19.792
between the plant and animal kingdoms.
Plants which are not dependent

34:19.876 --> 34:22.667
entirely on soil and
sunlight for their food,

34:22.751 --> 34:25.001
but which sometimes eat live insects.

34:34.167 --> 34:35.208
Well

34:35.333 --> 34:41.458
Each stage, each adaption,
each mutation is one step higher

34:41.542 --> 34:43.792
in the battle of the
plant kingdom for survival.

34:44.542 --> 34:46.167
Now what if

34:46.251 --> 34:48.876
What if a plant were
to take the next step?

34:49.042 --> 34:52.167
What if there were a mutation
that could developed intelligence?

34:52.292 --> 34:55.083
The ability to protect itself?

34:56.417 --> 35:00.917
Perhaps even to know who its
enemies were and destroy them?

35:01.709 --> 35:04.792
A plant like that could
take over the world.

35:06.459 --> 35:08.876
But it's not possible, it's fantastic!

35:10.334 --> 35:11.626
I wonder

35:17.751 --> 35:19.792
Lunch will be ready in a few moments.

35:19.876 --> 35:22.751
Oh yes. Well, I'm awfully busy at the
moment. Do you mind if I skip lunch today?

35:22.834 --> 35:25.334
Oh, you've got the eat something. I'll
get you some coffee and sandwiches.

35:25.417 --> 35:26.459
Oh, thank you.

35:40.751 --> 35:42.084
A brain.

35:42.376 --> 35:43.834
I was right.

36:30.667 --> 36:34.209
Darling, it's a lovely clay.
Why don't you go out and play?

36:39.501 --> 36:42.792
It isn't any fun without Rusty.

37:16.626 --> 37:18.084
Did you call the police?

37:18.709 --> 37:22.126
We didn't know what to do. We
thought it'd be better to call you first.

37:22.626 --> 37:25.459
He was alone in the room?
- Yes, all the time.

38:19.251 --> 38:21.501
I'm going to the lab to
get my men down.

38:37.209 --> 38:38.334
Carol

38:39.209 --> 38:40.584
Carol, come away.

38:42.626 --> 38:44.292
How are we going to get out?

38:55.167 --> 38:57.542
There must be some
way of destroying this.

39:12.209 --> 39:14.251
There must be. I know it.

39:36.042 --> 39:37.667
Get some newspapers.

39:44.542 --> 39:48.501
There's one thing, which every
intelligent thing is afraid of: the fire!

39:48.792 --> 39:52.834
If a species ever develops that
isn't, it could be the end of the world.

39:52.917 --> 39:54.251
Open the door.

40:29.501 --> 40:31.042
Should be alright now.

40:48.126 --> 40:50.001
And that's going to happen to me?

40:50.459 --> 40:53.834
Maybe to all of us.
But you need not despair.

40:53.917 --> 40:57.667
The fifth card may show
you how to avoid

41:02.792 --> 41:04.167
What is it?

41:04.501 --> 41:06.126
It does not matter.

41:06.459 --> 41:07.751
What was it?

41:08.209 --> 41:10.792
I was hoping it
.. it might not be

41:10.876 --> 41:13.917
Oh for heaven's sake!
What is all this nonsense?

41:14.751 --> 41:20.834
No nonsense, I assure you. Now is
there anyone else who would wish to try?

41:35.584 --> 41:38.876
Okay I'll have a I'll have a try.

41:39.292 --> 41:41.584
The first time I've ever
done this without chips.

41:42.084 --> 41:45.001
Just tap the cards three times.

41:56.709 --> 41:59.376
And now your future.

42:04.376 --> 42:06.126
You are a musician?

42:06.501 --> 42:09.501
Yes. A lot of people
don't seem to think so.

42:13.376 --> 42:15.001
Ah, that's more like it.

42:20.792 --> 42:22.626
That's my mother in law.

42:25.251 --> 42:28.751
Do not jest at the image of a God.

42:30.167 --> 42:31.501
A God?

42:31.626 --> 42:35.542
The powerful and malign God of Voodoo.

43:22.542 --> 43:24.334
Hi, Wally. What's the good word?

43:24.459 --> 43:25.626
You're going to love me.

43:25.709 --> 43:27.834
Oh yeh. Purely, as a mother.

43:27.917 --> 43:29.834
I've got a great booking for you.

43:29.917 --> 43:32.501
Oh yeah, what have you
got us this time? Siberia?

43:32.584 --> 43:38.001
No. Days of sunshine and romance.
Nights under an azure sky.

43:38.126 --> 43:39.501
Another holiday camp, right?

43:39.542 --> 43:44.876
The West Indies, Island of Paiti, town
of Dupont, Club called "The Flamingo".

43:45.501 --> 43:46.667
Good?

43:46.751 --> 43:49.042
Yeah, great. When do we go?
- Two weeks.

43:49.167 --> 43:51.292
Hey, you little sweetheart.

43:52.917 --> 43:55.167
We gonna go to the West Indies!
- That's great!

43:55.292 --> 43:56.501
We go where?

43:57.501 --> 43:59.501
We're going to the West Indies!
The West Indies!

44:24.459 --> 44:27.042
Well and on that sweet note, boys,

44:27.042 --> 44:29.001

I'm Sammy Coin. You
must be my replacement.

46:11.792 --> 46:13.751
Yeh, that's right. This
is Alan. This is Tubby.

46:13.917 --> 46:14.917
How do you do?

46:15.084 --> 46:20.584
Hey, I dig that Calypso music, man.
It's good sung by a real West Indian.

46:20.751 --> 46:22.292
West Indian?
You must be joke.

46:22.376 --> 46:24.834
I came out of the East End.
First music I heard was Bow Bells.

46:25.626 --> 46:27.001
How come you're here then?

46:27.126 --> 46:29.417
Well, you got an agent, I got an agent.

46:29.501 --> 46:31.584
For ten per cent, he'd
book me in Little Rock.

46:32.334 --> 46:33.626
Cigarettes please?

46:37.126 --> 46:39.667
Yes sure, I think I'm
old enough to smoke.

46:45.792 --> 46:47.792
Hey, look at that monster

46:58.709 --> 46:59.917
What did I do?

47:00.584 --> 47:02.626
That monster is the
Voodoo God, Dambala,

47:02.876 --> 47:05.376
and Voodoo is the one thing you
don't mess around with here.

47:06.209 --> 47:07.334
Look around.

47:15.792 --> 47:18.042
Hey! All the chicks are wearing them.

47:18.084 --> 47:19.084
<i>X w' d</i>

47:20.501 --> 47:22.126
I heard of these Voodoo dances.

47:23.501 --> 47:25.376
That's where the action
is at night, isn't it? - Yeah!

47:25.459 --> 47:27.834
And you'll hear it from your
hotel room. - Yeah.

47:28.084 --> 47:30.376
Out in the woods.
Drums beating

47:30.376 --> 47:31.751
Yeah!
- Girls dancing...

47:31.876 --> 47:34.584
Yeah!
- Wild, frenzied

47:34.626 --> 47:36.417
Yeah!
- Very few clothes on...

47:36.501 --> 47:37.751
Yeah!
- Take my advice?

47:37.792 --> 47:39.126
F 11-221] I!

47:39.667 --> 47:40.667
Why?

47:40.792 --> 47:42.417
Man, it's a religious ceremony.

47:42.792 --> 47:43.751
So?

47:43.834 --> 47:45.251
You ain't that denomination.

50:37.292 --> 50:38.626
Who are you?

50:44.584 --> 50:46.792
Biff Bailey Biff

50:48.292 --> 50:49.626
Biff Bailey.

50:50.459 --> 50:51.709
What is this?

50:51.834 --> 50:56.459
Oh, well, I was listening to your
music, so I I wrote it down.

50:57.001 --> 51:01.501
You wrote down the sacred
music of the great God Dambala.

51:04.417 --> 51:08.126
It could be a hit, make a fortune.

51:11.042 --> 51:16.126
If you wrote it, we could go 50-50.

51:16.251 --> 51:20.167
It belongs to the God Dambala.
Known only to his own people

51:20.251 --> 51:21.501
for centuries.

51:21.584 --> 51:24.876
Oh, well, if it's that old,
then it's out of copyright.

51:24.917 --> 51:26.542
You get creases in my shirt.

51:26.751 --> 51:32.292
The God Dambala is a jealous God. If
you steal from him, he will be revenged.

51:32.417 --> 51:38.292
Wherever you are, he will be revenged.
Do not steal from the God Dambala.

51:38.792 --> 51:40.501
Now go.

51:54.042 --> 51:55.834
Now when we get back to London,

51:55.917 --> 51:58.792
I'm going to make a whole
routine around that voodoo number.

51:59.209 --> 52:02.376
Biff man, you be careful
of that Voodoo God.

52:02.501 --> 52:04.001
Oh, don't be silly.
- It's dangerous, man

52:04.084 --> 52:06.376
What can a Voodoo God do to me?

52:22.459 --> 52:29.501
Give me your shoulder to cry on ♪
Your heart to rely on ♪

52:29.917 --> 52:31.834

52:45.292 --> 52:50.459

53:08.167 --> 53:10.209
You still going through
with this Voodoo thing, man?

53:10.292 --> 53:11.292
Sure, why not?

53:11.376 --> 53:13.709
I'll tell you one thing. You got guts.

53:13.792 --> 53:14.834
Thanks.

53:14.917 --> 53:16.501
We'll probably see 'em
before the night's out

53:16.501 --> 53:17.834
spread out all over the floor.

53:18.542 --> 53:20.292
They'll eat anything here.

53:20.501 --> 53:21.751
Don't worry though.

53:21.792 --> 53:24.417
My uncle's an undertaker.
He'll do it for you wholesale.

53:25.042 --> 53:27.209
Don't forget the double-breasted lid!

53:30.751 --> 53:35.667
Give me something more
then just a promise or two <i>I</i>

53:35.792 --> 53:41.584
Show me real affection and
I'll give my love to you ♪

53:41.667 --> 53:45.667
Take me in your arms

53:49.709 --> 53:52.959

Give me love ♪

54:10.459 --> 54:12.667
During his recent trip
to the West Indies

54:13.167 --> 54:16.084
Biff Bailey heard an
ancient Voodoo tune.

54:16.501 --> 54:19.459
Here it is, in his own
special arrangement.

57:04.084 --> 57:05.084
Told you!

57:17.167 --> 57:18.667
My beautiful club

57:18.751 --> 57:20.376
You're insured, aren't you?

57:22.459 --> 57:27.501
Yeah. I could have the whole
place redone Moroccan

57:29.542 --> 57:33.042
Oh man, you don't play
around with Voodoo.

57:33.709 --> 57:34.876
What are you doing?

57:35.376 --> 57:37.751
I want to change this
arrangement, actually.

57:37.876 --> 57:39.542
It wasn't too good in
the middle, so

57:39.917 --> 57:41.167
I'll take it home

57:41.251 --> 57:43.501
Take it home? After what happened here?

57:43.542 --> 57:45.251
What happened here?

57:45.709 --> 57:49.417
Who d'you think sent that wind,
Kenny Ball? That was Voodoo, man.

57:50.084 --> 57:51.709
I'd burn that music fast.

57:51.834 --> 57:54.667
You're not still believing
in this Voodoo stuff, are you?

57:54.792 --> 57:56.917
No, man, but I play percentages.

57:57.084 --> 58:00.251
I wouldn't take that home. Not
after what happened here tonight.

58:00.334 --> 58:02.292
No? I'll see you.

58:06.917 --> 58:10.001
Well, more work for my uncle!

58:39.917 --> 58:41.376
Got a match?

58:41.501 --> 58:43.584
Oh, yeah yeah sure.

58:45.501 --> 58:47.501
Here, you keep them.
- Thanks.

59:32.667 --> 59:34.584
Which way to Piccadilly Circus, mac?

59:34.667 --> 59:35.834
Yeh Yeh

59:38.501 --> 59:40.501
Oh, these British are all nuts.

01:02:27.751 --> 01:02:30.084
That'll teach me not to steal tunes.

01:02:31.792 --> 01:02:34.042
Well, how do I get out of it?

01:02:49.626 --> 01:02:51.292
Ours was the same?

01:02:53.876 --> 01:02:55.251
What does it mean?

01:02:55.792 --> 01:02:59.334
I'll tell you what it means.
Absolutely nothing.

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:02.251
What makes you so sure?

01:03:02.751 --> 01:03:06.542
Foretelling the future with a
pack of cards Complete rubbish.

01:03:06.626 --> 01:03:09.167
Then why are you afraid to try them?

01:03:09.501 --> 01:03:11.042
Afraid?

01:03:11.501 --> 01:03:14.251
To participate in your
ridiculous parlour game?

01:03:20.126 --> 01:03:27.209
Very well. Very well. Shuffle
your cards. Foretell my destiny.

01:03:36.251 --> 01:03:38.626
Remarkable, really remarkable.

01:03:39.542 --> 01:03:42.126
I don't think there's very
much more that can be said

01:03:42.126 --> 01:03:43.667
about that particular atrocity.

01:03:45.292 --> 01:03:46.917
Dear, dear, dear

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:53.792
Yes, atrocity is right.
Ah. What have we here?

01:03:57.126 --> 01:04:04.084
Yes, indeed a work of notable
incompetence, even for Mr. Eric Landor.

01:04:04.209 --> 01:04:06.459
You don't like my work,

01:04:06.459 --> 01:04:08.042
Mr. Marsh?

01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:10.542
Ah, the great man himself.

01:04:11.209 --> 01:04:15.501
One wonders why you come to
my exhibitions so regularly

01:04:15.542 --> 01:04:17.501
if my work displeases you.

01:04:17.542 --> 01:04:19.584
<i>,I </i> 9 <i>f' </i> D

01:04:20.042 --> 01:04:23.584
My paper pays me to attend these
exhibitions, so attend them I must

01:04:24.042 --> 01:04:28.501
whether the artist in question
is a genius or a charlatan.

01:04:28.584 --> 01:04:31.459
And you consider yourself
competent to judge?

01:04:31.542 --> 01:04:34.626
I don't think my reputation as a
critic has ever been called in doubt.

01:04:34.709 --> 01:04:39.626
In that case, I wonder why you never
give me advice on how to improve my work.

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:43.876
My clear sir, the only advice that I could
possibly offer you, would be: give up.

01:04:46.251 --> 01:04:49.417
A harsh thing to say to a
man who's been painting

01:04:49.501 --> 01:04:52.626
all his life with some
measure of success.

01:04:53.001 --> 01:04:54.292
Success!

01:04:55.001 --> 01:04:58.376
If we are discussing money,
pray let's not delay any longer.

01:04:58.376 --> 01:05:00.459
I was under the impression
we were discussing art.

01:05:00.792 --> 01:05:05.209
Take this masterpiece, for example.
Just what is it supposed to say?

01:05:05.542 --> 01:05:08.292
It is merely a series of
splodges of print applied

01:05:08.376 --> 01:05:11.209
without any creativity whatsoever.
What is it supposed to mean?

01:05:11.292 --> 01:05:16.917
Nothing specific. The viewer
is supposed to react to it.

01:05:17.001 --> 01:05:21.209
To create his own meaning
out of his own experience.

01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:24.542
Everyone will see
something quite different.

01:05:25.084 --> 01:05:27.126
In other words: it
means absolutely nothing.

01:05:27.626 --> 01:05:29.751
To those who can't see.

01:05:29.876 --> 01:05:31.501
But I can see, Mr. Landor.

01:05:31.542 --> 01:05:33.917
I can see very well, when
there is something worth seeing.

01:05:34.334 --> 01:05:36.834
I live by my vision, Mr. Landor.

01:05:36.917 --> 01:05:38.459
Mr. Marsh

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:42.792
We have a canvas in from a young artist
we're thinking of exhibiting shortly.

01:05:42.917 --> 01:05:45.417
I wonder if you'd mind telling
us what you think of his work.

01:05:45.667 --> 01:05:47.334
Well, it's highly irregular.

01:05:47.459 --> 01:05:49.126
Oh please, please.

01:05:49.792 --> 01:05:51.834
Oh very well, just this once.

01:05:54.292 --> 01:05:55.334
Thank you.

01:05:58.126 --> 01:06:01.792
Ah now, this is quite a different matter,
quite a different matter indeed.

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:05.834
Clearly the work of a creative
artist of considerable promise.

01:06:09.042 --> 01:06:12.292
Notice the wide sweep of colour,
the balance, the brushwork,

01:06:12.626 --> 01:06:17.001
together with a certain denial of the
accepted standards, the mock critical

01:06:17.084 --> 01:06:21.084
humour of the entire composition. You
could learn a great deal about painting

01:06:21.209 --> 01:06:22.667
from this artist, Mr. Landor.

01:06:23.084 --> 01:06:26.917
Then I should very much like to
meet him. Would that be possible?

01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:29.501
He's here now as a matter of fact.
-Indeed?

01:06:52.459 --> 01:06:58.501
My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, we
have as our guest of honour tonight

01:06:58.542 --> 01:07:04.001
the eminent author and art
critic Mr. Franklyn Marsh.

01:07:10.417 --> 01:07:14.626
My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen,

01:07:15.917 --> 01:07:19.042
I am extremely honoured
to have been asked

01:07:19.126 --> 01:07:21.876
to address this fine organisation,

01:07:21.876 --> 01:07:26.876
which has done so much to
foster an interest in the arts.

01:07:28.042 --> 01:07:30.042
The world of art today

01:07:33.334 --> 01:07:37.709
The world of art today

01:07:47.167 --> 01:07:49.501
The day of the action painter is over.

01:07:49.876 --> 01:07:53.917
Soon art will regain its sanity
and return to the fundamental

01:07:54.084 --> 01:07:56.292
representational principals of

01:07:57.251 --> 01:07:59.292
You were saying, Mr. Marsh

01:08:00.292 --> 01:08:02.292
I must crave your indulgence.

01:08:02.417 --> 01:08:03.834
I have a pressing appointment.

01:08:05.084 --> 01:08:07.417
He's so fascinating on this subject.

01:08:49.501 --> 01:08:51.667
Have they found out who
the patient is yet, nurse?

01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:53.834
Yes, Eric Landor, the artist.

01:08:55.209 --> 01:08:58.209
Artist? Not anymore!

01:09:01.501 --> 01:09:05.376
The European Space Research Organisation
plans to ask the United States for

01:09:05.376 --> 01:09:08.251
permission to set up a satellite
contacting station in Alaska.

01:09:09.626 --> 01:09:12.126
In London the well-known
artist Eric Landor

01:09:12.126 --> 01:09:14.292
was the victim of a hit and run driver.

01:09:14.876 --> 01:09:17.251
Mr. Landor was taken to
St. Michael's Hospital.

01:09:18.001 --> 01:09:20.084
He has not yet regained consciousness.

01:09:49.876 --> 01:09:50.917
Fran k?

01:09:52.292 --> 01:09:54.751
Oh, what's the matter? Why so jumpy?

01:09:55.126 --> 01:09:57.751
Words don't seem to be
coming very easy this day.

01:09:57.834 --> 01:09:58.876
What you need is a drink.

01:09:59.001 --> 01:10:01.584
What? No, no thank you very
much. I want to get home.

01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:03.542
Oh come on, just a quick one.

01:10:03.626 --> 01:10:06.251
No, thank you very much, George,
I really must get on with this.

01:10:06.334 --> 01:10:08.042
Oh alright.

01:12:43.876 --> 01:12:45.167
Who is it?

01:12:55.542 --> 01:12:56.626
Who is it?

01:16:25.459 --> 01:16:27.417
Well, wherever you've been
for the past few days,

01:16:27.501 --> 01:16:29.001
it's certainly improved your temper.

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:31.292
Don't tell me he actually
liked a painting for once.

01:16:31.292 --> 01:16:33.709
Well, I had a slight problem,
but everything's alright now.

01:16:33.792 --> 01:16:36.126
That calls for a celebration.
What are you going to have?

01:16:36.167 --> 01:16:39.001
No, no, no, the drinks are
on me. Hey miss, please.

01:16:39.084 --> 01:16:40.542
The same again, will you please?

01:16:42.251 --> 01:16:45.917
I heard you calling a round, Frank.
You know that's too good to miss.

01:16:47.501 --> 01:16:51.084
Yes. Please, have anything
you want, anything at all.

01:16:51.209 --> 01:16:53.334
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

01:17:38.792 --> 01:17:41.042
Is he hurt bad?
- He'll live.

01:17:42.001 --> 01:17:45.626
Yeah, but he'll be blind for the
rest of his life. Poor guy.

01:17:47.001 --> 01:17:49.334
Still there's lots of
things a blind man can do.

01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:05.459
A very pretty story. Thank you.

01:18:05.542 --> 01:18:07.876
It is not all the story.

01:18:16.167 --> 01:18:18.501
Then it's the same for all of us.

01:18:19.917 --> 01:18:21.334
What do you mean?

01:18:21.417 --> 01:18:24.667
Every time the cards have been
asked how we could avoid the future,

01:18:25.584 --> 01:18:29.501
the answer is the same: death.

01:18:30.417 --> 01:18:32.167
That's a bad word, man.

01:18:39.667 --> 01:18:42.251
Well, let's see what the
cards have to say about me.

01:18:42.626 --> 01:18:45.084
You are sure you wish to know?

01:18:46.459 --> 01:18:47.876
Deal the cards.

01:19:01.834 --> 01:19:03.292
The Empress.

01:19:04.917 --> 01:19:06.126
The Hermit.

01:19:07.584 --> 01:19:08.876
The Star.

01:19:10.501 --> 01:19:12.042
The Lovers.

01:19:17.667 --> 01:19:19.209
Oh, why this?

01:19:19.251 --> 01:19:21.042
It's an old American custom.

01:19:21.501 --> 01:19:24.001
Et ceci est une vielle coutume Francaise.

01:19:25.626 --> 01:19:27.501
Old French custom.

01:19:27.584 --> 01:19:29.084
Custom
- Coutume.

01:19:29.209 --> 01:19:30.876
Co Cot
- Coutume

01:19:30.876 --> 01:19:31.876
...tume

01:19:31.917 --> 01:19:33.917
Non, coutume. U...
- U...

01:19:33.917 --> 01:19:35.626
Coutume...

01:19:44.542 --> 01:19:49.251
Welcome to Pemberton, the prettiest
little town in New England.

01:19:49.917 --> 01:19:51.417
I hope it likes me.

01:19:51.501 --> 01:19:53.626
Honey, it could not help but like you.

01:19:54.084 --> 01:19:56.792
You know, I was worried about
coming with you to America.

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:58.751
You're going to get on just fine.

01:19:59.876 --> 01:20:01.709
Are you hungry?

01:20:02.626 --> 01:20:06.501
I'll go and see if there's
something in the kitchen.

01:20:07.126 --> 01:20:08.126
Eat.

01:20:10.042 --> 01:20:13.584
You go and get acquainted
with the house, okay?

01:20:56.876 --> 01:20:57.876
Au!

01:20:58.501 --> 01:20:59.542
Bob?

01:21:05.917 --> 01:21:07.584
I I... I cut myself.

01:21:08.376 --> 01:21:09.542
The can opener.

01:21:14.042 --> 01:21:15.417
I'll wash it.

01:21:18.542 --> 01:21:19.917
No, no.

01:21:22.376 --> 01:21:23.876
Let me do it.

01:22:26.167 --> 01:22:28.751
Okay. You can have the car.

01:22:29.667 --> 01:22:32.084
Dr. Blake is going to come
and pick me up anyway.

01:22:32.376 --> 01:22:33.709
Who is Dr. Blake?

01:22:33.792 --> 01:22:38.376
Dr. Blake? Dr. Blake is the
only other doctor in town,

01:22:38.459 --> 01:22:41.376
and we work at the clinic
together and he is gonna

01:22:42.251 --> 01:22:43.501
That'll be him now.

01:22:44.584 --> 01:22:46.459
Come on, honey. I know
he wants to meet you.

01:22:47.334 --> 01:22:48.542
Hi.
- Hi. Good morning.

01:22:48.626 --> 01:22:52.292
Good morning. Doctor, this is
my wife Nicolle. Dr. Blake.

01:22:52.376 --> 01:22:54.501
Glad to know you. I hope
you like our fair city.

01:22:54.626 --> 01:22:56.042
I'm sure I will.

01:22:56.126 --> 01:22:58.542
If there is anything I can ever do
for you, don't hesitate to tell me.

01:22:58.626 --> 01:22:59.709
Thank you.

01:23:01.417 --> 01:23:02.459
All set?

01:23:02.501 --> 01:23:04.126
It was nice meeting you.

01:23:05.709 --> 01:23:07.042
Bye,honey.

01:23:07.667 --> 01:23:09.626
Drive carefully, eh?
- I will.

01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:11.001
Bye.

01:23:16.126 --> 01:23:20.001
Well, as you say, it is a strange
case. Sounds like anemia.

01:23:20.084 --> 01:23:23.584
No, no. It's not the quality
of the boy's blood that's wrong.

01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:26.792
It's the quantity. I mean it's that
there doesn't seem to be enough of it.

01:23:27.417 --> 01:23:29.167
The boy's in here. Do
you want to see him?

01:23:29.251 --> 01:23:30.292
All right.

01:23:33.167 --> 01:23:34.751
Johnny, this is Dr. Blake.

01:23:35.292 --> 01:23:37.084
Hello.
- Hello, Johnny.

01:23:37.584 --> 01:23:39.501
Good morning.
- Good morning, Doctor.

01:23:39.542 --> 01:23:41.501
Dr. Blake just wants to
have a look at you. Okay?

01:23:41.501 --> 01:23:43.001
Has Johnny been eating his food?

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:44.167
YES.

01:23:44.167 --> 01:23:46.626
Getting enough sleep, fresh air?

01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:49.334
Well, he always sleeps
with his window open.

01:23:49.417 --> 01:23:51.001
Well, let's have a look.

01:23:57.376 --> 01:23:58.917
When did he get these?

01:23:59.042 --> 01:24:02.209
Just a few days ago. The clay he
complained he was feeling weak.

01:24:02.626 --> 01:24:04.209
All right. Thanks.

01:24:04.334 --> 01:24:05.834
Eh, will you wait in the other room?

01:24:05.917 --> 01:24:07.042
Come on, Johnny.

01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:08.792
Would you come this way, please?

01:24:08.834 --> 01:24:09.917
Yes, thank you.

01:24:13.001 --> 01:24:14.501
Well, what do you think?

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:18.001
I don't know. I really don't
know what to make of it.

01:24:18.417 --> 01:24:19.626
What do you think?

01:24:19.751 --> 01:24:24.251
I don't know. If these
were medieval times,

01:24:24.334 --> 01:24:29.126
I'd I'd almost say he was
the victim of a vampire.

01:24:36.751 --> 01:24:38.001
A vampire?

01:24:38.126 --> 01:24:39.917
Yes, that's what Dr. Blake said.

01:24:40.084 --> 01:24:42.251
Can you imagine in this day and age?

01:24:42.626 --> 01:24:44.667
He took some blood
samples from the boy though

01:24:44.792 --> 01:24:47.376
and we should know by tomorrow
morning what it really is.

01:24:47.459 --> 01:24:48.709
How will you know?

01:24:49.251 --> 01:24:52.584
Well, he'll work some tests on
it in the laboratory tonight.

01:24:52.626 --> 01:24:54.751
He has a laboratory in the clinic?

01:24:54.876 --> 01:24:58.917
No, no. He has got a workshop
on top of the old Finch building.

01:24:59.042 --> 01:25:00.584
He works there at night sometimes.

01:25:01.042 --> 01:25:02.917
He's a real lonely guy.

01:25:05.626 --> 01:25:07.834
You want some more steak, honey?

01:25:09.917 --> 01:25:12.292
No, no.

01:27:20.917 --> 01:27:22.917
Why didn’t it attack you then?

01:27:24.001 --> 01:27:25.501
I figured that out later.

01:27:25.626 --> 01:27:29.876
My arms made the sign of a cross
as I raised them to shield myself.

01:27:31.792 --> 01:27:34.376
But how could it know that I suspected?

01:27:35.834 --> 01:27:37.792
Dr. Blake, your patient is ready.

01:27:55.209 --> 01:27:57.751
Did he sleep with his
window open last night?

01:27:58.376 --> 01:28:00.667
That's not wrong, is it?
He must have fresh air.

01:28:00.792 --> 01:28:03.084
No, no. It's not wrong. Leave it open.

01:28:03.501 --> 01:28:09.501
Only tonight I want to be
there in case anything happens.

01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:03.042
Sweetheart?

01:29:03.084 --> 01:29:07.209
R" (m <i>"I</i> I

01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:17.917
Nicolle is my wife.

01:29:18.542 --> 01:29:20.584
Do you know what a vampire is?

01:29:21.334 --> 01:29:24.626
A spirit which takes up
residence in a human body,

01:29:24.751 --> 01:29:27.792
conferring upon it the power
to turn into a bat at night

01:29:27.917 --> 01:29:32.459
so that it can glut itself on
the blood of innocent victims.

01:29:33.501 --> 01:29:35.209
And if the victim dies,

01:29:35.876 --> 01:29:39.417
he becomes a vampire and
after death rises from the grave

01:29:40.126 --> 01:29:42.584
and walks the earth in search of blood.

01:29:43.584 --> 01:29:45.334
That would have happened to Johnny

01:29:46.501 --> 01:29:50.751
if he had died of Nicolle's bite.
It may happen to her next victim.

01:29:51.251 --> 01:29:54.459
Tonight she will go
in search of someone.

01:29:54.876 --> 01:29:56.167
Watch her.

01:29:56.667 --> 01:29:59.292
The only way to kill a vampire

01:29:59.501 --> 01:30:03.167
is to drive a wooden stake
through its heart.

01:30:04.167 --> 01:30:05.209
Watch her!

01:30:06.042 --> 01:30:08.001
And when she returns

01:31:22.459 --> 01:31:23.459
Nicolle

01:31:26.042 --> 01:31:27.209
I love you.

01:32:06.251 --> 01:32:07.792
A vampire?

01:32:09.126 --> 01:32:10.792
It's true.

01:32:12.501 --> 01:32:14.417
I never heard anything
so crazy in all my life.

01:32:14.459 --> 01:32:17.167
Look, Dr. Blake will confirm
it when he gets here.

01:32:17.459 --> 01:32:18.501
Confirm what?

01:32:21.126 --> 01:32:23.126
That my wife was a vampire.

01:32:23.792 --> 01:32:25.251
But that's nonsense.

01:32:25.376 --> 01:32:27.667
There are no such things as vampires.

01:32:29.667 --> 01:32:30.876
But you told me.

01:32:32.501 --> 01:32:33.917
You gave me the stake.

01:32:35.584 --> 01:32:37.376
She attacked you.

01:32:37.459 --> 01:32:39.376
I don't know what you are talking about.

01:32:39.501 --> 01:32:41.292
Nobody attacked me.

01:32:42.167 --> 01:32:44.042
Well, tell them please.

01:32:46.334 --> 01:32:47.834
Tell them!

01:32:49.876 --> 01:32:50.876
Cuff him!

01:32:50.917 --> 01:32:51.917
<i>YEW I and</i>

01:32:51.917 --> 01:32:52.917
Ok, let's go.

01:32:55.667 --> 01:32:57.667
Doctor, please.

01:33:15.876 --> 01:33:17.334
Can we give you a lift, Doctor?

01:33:17.542 --> 01:33:18.751
No, no thanks. I'll walk.

01:33:18.876 --> 01:33:19.876
Okay.

01:33:24.792 --> 01:33:30.251
This town isn't big enough for
two doctors or two vampires.

01:33:45.126 --> 01:33:46.542
Nicolle

01:33:47.501 --> 01:33:50.001
Do you know someone by that name?

01:33:52.376 --> 01:33:54.917
I met her on the continent.
I was thinking

01:34:00.042 --> 01:34:01.542
Turn the next card, please.

01:34:08.001 --> 01:34:10.001
Ave, ave, aye

01:34:12.126 --> 01:34:16.459
There are five of us here
and none of us has a future.

01:34:18.792 --> 01:34:23.209
What about him?
- Yes, what about you?

01:34:45.126 --> 01:34:46.542
All of us.

01:34:49.417 --> 01:34:56.376
We're all together in this carriage
and none of us has a future.

01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:59.584
It's this train
- It's going to crash.

01:35:00.334 --> 01:35:02.459
What are you doing?
- Pull the communication cord.

01:35:02.501 --> 01:35:05.626
Don't you fool. For that way you
might cause an accident. Sit down.

01:35:06.917 --> 01:35:08.626
We can't just sit here and wait.

01:35:09.126 --> 01:35:10.501
Why have you done this?

01:35:11.001 --> 01:35:13.501
What do you want? Who are you?

01:35:16.084 --> 01:35:18.417
Have you not guessed?

01:35:29.876 --> 01:35:30.876
We're slowing down.

01:35:31.001 --> 01:35:33.167
Is it Bradley? Can you see a sign?

01:35:34.542 --> 01:35:35.751
I don't know.

01:35:36.501 --> 01:35:38.876
Well, where else could it be?

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:42.209
We've reached the end of our journey.

01:35:42.292 --> 01:35:46.667
No accidents. So much for Dr. Terror.

01:36:42.001 --> 01:36:43.709
Dr. Schreck.
