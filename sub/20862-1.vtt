02:13.099 --> 02:15.434
My name is Cygnus.

02:15.436 --> 02:18.036
I am my people's hunter.

02:18.438 --> 02:21.506
And it has grown scarce for some time.

02:22.108 --> 02:24.343
We are the children of man.

02:25.011 --> 02:28.680
Out here, we are not the only ones.

02:29.349 --> 02:32.951
Many bands now travel the land again.

02:32.953 --> 02:35.654
We are called last arc.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.857
The ones with stories on our skin.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.793
I wondered what became of the world

02:41.795 --> 02:44.396
before the one I was born into.

02:45.798 --> 02:49.334
I only knew a world where
the few moved together.

02:49.336 --> 02:53.038
I have farther to go to
find the beasts I hunt.

04:11.884 --> 04:13.351
Hey!

04:14.220 --> 04:15.787
Hey!

04:28.067 --> 04:30.135
Let me go. Let me go! Please.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.204
Why are you here?

04:32.638 --> 04:34.139
I know you.

04:35.107 --> 04:37.108
Now you see it too, right?

04:37.110 --> 04:39.578
The darker days.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.580
Yes.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.849
Me too, I see 'em too.

04:44.484 --> 04:46.785
But she needs you.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.653
Hunter of blood...

04:48.821 --> 04:50.989
And hope.

04:51.924 --> 04:54.493
Hope is not what I hunt for.

04:56.095 --> 04:58.330
Does it look like I have any hope?

04:58.332 --> 04:59.698
Hey!

05:00.933 --> 05:03.668
I'm just like you!
I see it too!

05:07.607 --> 05:09.841
I know your story too.

05:10.109 --> 05:12.210
You're the little boy.

05:12.845 --> 05:17.516
The little boy that killed the snakes.

05:23.189 --> 05:25.557
I'm done. The end!

05:29.829 --> 05:31.730
No!

05:34.133 --> 05:36.001
I live away from last arc

05:36.003 --> 05:37.936
to hear what the wind is saying.

05:38.137 --> 05:40.739
Even if it makes me their outsider.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.875
It's telling me that this can't go on.

05:44.477 --> 05:47.212
Sometimes I ask myself why I stay.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.882
But then I remember they
found me and brought me in.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.919
They gave me a place to call home.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.955
For this I have my life.

06:39.098 --> 06:41.766
The sun has crossed the river track

06:41.768 --> 06:44.002
and brings the hunter back.

06:46.038 --> 06:47.772
They know the way.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.309
They found us, Cygnus

06:51.711 --> 06:53.612
we're against the days.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.619
It doesn't help it's
written all over them.

07:01.387 --> 07:02.954
They're afraid.

07:05.558 --> 07:08.326
It's the future that must be protected.

07:09.962 --> 07:12.631
They don't go out there like you do.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.800
They can't.

07:17.403 --> 07:19.037
They're watching.

07:22.808 --> 07:24.809
Is everyone here?

07:35.588 --> 07:37.088
They're near.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.323
How many?

07:38.325 --> 07:40.158
Three.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.382
You're the hunter.

08:05.017 --> 08:07.519
You're the one that killed the snakes.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.090
What's it like?

08:13.192 --> 08:14.926
Elias!

08:15.795 --> 08:17.395
Elias.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.232
Elias!

08:28.841 --> 08:30.308
Listen to me, okay?

08:30.310 --> 08:31.976
That hunter

08:31.978 --> 08:34.479
has a mind where killing is a natural act.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.748
That hunter is not the same as you.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.451
It's not you or him, dad.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.287
Mom wanted us to live.

10:44.510 --> 10:46.244
I know you.

11:21.146 --> 11:23.114
Who's there?

11:25.484 --> 11:28.052
Nova, it's me.
I'm coming in.

11:29.655 --> 11:31.623
You precede yourself.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.762
It's not me you should be concerned about.

11:38.163 --> 11:40.164
You have a new orphan,

11:40.166 --> 11:42.333
and he's lucky to be alive.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.502
Elden was a good father

11:44.504 --> 11:46.804
but he didn't know how to
handle himself out there.

11:50.009 --> 11:53.444
Before we know the way out

11:54.680 --> 11:57.749
we must know ourselves first.

11:58.851 --> 12:02.120
The heretics should not be this close.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.590
Is that not a sign?

12:07.693 --> 12:09.260
Cygnus

12:10.062 --> 12:12.430
I need to send you.

12:14.566 --> 12:16.768
Send me where?

12:23.108 --> 12:25.944
Somewhere in the darkness.

12:27.212 --> 12:29.280
Where there is light.

12:30.549 --> 12:32.784
That has an answer.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.688
What do you see?

12:37.056 --> 12:39.457
I see us all trying to...

12:43.228 --> 12:45.463
It's not easy.

12:46.065 --> 12:48.299
Survival never is.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.868
But it's not a choice that we get to make.

12:53.973 --> 12:57.575
I believe in the stories.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.744
I've heard the stories.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.546
I'll believe it when I see scars.

13:02.281 --> 13:05.049
Then look at this!

13:12.291 --> 13:14.425
Who died

13:14.427 --> 13:17.028
in search with no end?

13:17.930 --> 13:19.464
Our ancestors!

13:19.466 --> 13:21.065
Ours!

13:22.334 --> 13:25.236
Don't you forget that.

13:27.172 --> 13:29.941
The hunt is all that I've ever known.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.844
I'm not asking you to kill.

13:33.612 --> 13:36.180
I'm asking you to hunt.

13:37.516 --> 13:39.517
To find the answers

13:39.519 --> 13:41.686
that will stop this.

13:53.132 --> 13:54.732
Shappa.

13:56.869 --> 13:58.369
Don't say it.

13:58.704 --> 14:00.204
I know.

14:00.672 --> 14:02.707
What do you know?

14:03.642 --> 14:05.209
Nova sent you.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.379
Did she say why?

14:08.381 --> 14:10.048
She knows why she wants me here.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.783
Ha!

14:13.018 --> 14:15.153
Nova knows what she wants,

14:15.155 --> 14:16.754
and doesn't want.

14:17.723 --> 14:19.891
I need an answer.

14:22.027 --> 14:25.063
You need to be hunting
for food, not answers.

14:26.565 --> 14:29.067
Nova wants me to find something.

14:29.668 --> 14:32.103
I'm not a scholar.
Where do I begin?

14:34.840 --> 14:36.207
With a question!

14:46.852 --> 14:49.253
It's in here somewhere.

14:49.721 --> 14:51.189
Oh!

14:51.191 --> 14:52.824
Okay, look.

14:53.092 --> 14:54.659
Over here.

14:55.027 --> 14:56.994
Over here.

14:57.896 --> 14:59.931
This is also the answer!

14:59.933 --> 15:01.766
Where would the answer be

15:01.768 --> 15:04.268
if it had be somewhere?

15:05.404 --> 15:07.605
Wherever it isn't.

15:12.211 --> 15:14.145
There would be older breakage here.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.282
And?

15:19.551 --> 15:22.019
It's been hot here for a very long time.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.491
That's a good place to look.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.292
Why?

15:28.727 --> 15:30.661
If you think of population

15:31.563 --> 15:33.631
or what used to be present.

15:34.399 --> 15:36.400
Then it's pretty simple to look at

15:36.402 --> 15:38.069
what isn't

15:38.071 --> 15:40.138
and what is.

15:42.407 --> 15:45.042
There could be more like us out there.

15:46.245 --> 15:49.547
I need to take a look at your stories.

16:02.928 --> 16:05.329
Yeah, yeah.

16:10.102 --> 16:12.670
You were there!

16:14.139 --> 16:16.707
I remember a burning sky.

16:17.509 --> 16:21.212
And being taken up when a
shadow eclipsed the sun.

16:27.019 --> 16:29.253
Tokens of our past

16:29.521 --> 16:31.689
are our guide

16:31.691 --> 16:33.891
when we have no map.

16:36.628 --> 16:39.063
You could kill snakes with your two hands

16:39.965 --> 16:42.700
before you could even walk.

16:44.136 --> 16:46.204
You have strength.

16:46.838 --> 16:48.739
Don't be afraid to use it.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.046
We don't have a choice now.

16:55.814 --> 16:57.815
This time

16:57.817 --> 16:59.784
had to come.

17:30.015 --> 17:32.550
Can you tell me

17:32.552 --> 17:35.086
what it's like to be alone?

17:37.723 --> 17:39.824
The world listens to you live.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.327
Don't be afraid.

17:43.862 --> 17:46.264
My dad had more to tell me.

17:47.099 --> 17:48.966
I just hope we can find a way out of here.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.036
That's what I am going for.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.437
Here.

17:53.439 --> 17:54.805
Take these.

17:55.374 --> 17:57.441
They're from my dad.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.443
Give it to the ones who are hiding,

17:59.445 --> 18:01.612
waiting to kill.

18:06.385 --> 18:09.654
I will stand for you to find your way.

18:10.389 --> 18:11.956
I promise.

22:50.368 --> 22:52.903
It will soon be ours.

22:56.408 --> 22:58.008
He said

22:58.010 --> 23:00.411
we can't kill this one.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.780
He said he doesn't want him.

23:03.181 --> 23:05.082
He needs him.

23:10.355 --> 23:12.756
I see what you are,

23:12.758 --> 23:14.758
hunter.

23:18.863 --> 23:21.665
You should have killed
me. Why didn't you?

23:21.933 --> 23:24.602
I don't regret letting you live.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.872
You're already dead.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.550
Yeah!

23:39.552 --> 23:41.118
Yes!

23:41.120 --> 23:42.219
Harder!

23:42.221 --> 23:44.054
Make him bleed!

23:44.056 --> 23:45.556
Yeah!

23:45.558 --> 23:46.457
Oh!

23:46.459 --> 23:48.092
Yes!

23:49.729 --> 23:51.662
Zizzik!

23:52.063 --> 23:53.797
You know you can't kill him.

23:56.401 --> 23:59.069
This I need to know.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.804
Not for him,

24:00.806 --> 24:02.640
but for our power.

24:03.308 --> 24:05.075
It's been years!

24:05.077 --> 24:06.777
What is one more day?

24:06.779 --> 24:09.747
We are tired of waiting, Lexi!

24:09.749 --> 24:12.116
Lupis, stay out of this.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.917
Something must break!

24:13.919 --> 24:16.420
Either it's him, or it's us.

24:16.422 --> 24:18.489
So stop fighting me.

24:18.491 --> 24:21.592
If I don't fight today,
tomorrow there are no "if's".

24:21.594 --> 24:23.827
Torik needs the answers!

24:25.630 --> 24:27.831
No! No!

24:31.836 --> 24:33.837
Aha! Ha!!

26:32.624 --> 26:34.758
Many will die

26:34.760 --> 26:38.128
to keep a noose around
that killer's collar.

26:49.908 --> 26:52.176
Don't worry.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.978
We'll get there.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.680
It is done.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.849
Bring her up here.

27:41.526 --> 27:44.094
We need the power, torik.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.699
Betrayal opens the door.

27:49.133 --> 27:51.134
Remember that.

27:51.136 --> 27:52.502
Man did.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.705
That's what moved them.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.473
Her betrayal

27:56.475 --> 27:59.710
will open the door to your heart's desire.

27:59.712 --> 28:01.745
Isn't that interesting?

28:25.370 --> 28:27.838
Come on!

28:30.575 --> 28:32.576
No!

28:48.860 --> 28:51.028
When I was

28:51.030 --> 28:53.463
in the hills once

28:53.731 --> 28:56.266
one of them horses

28:56.701 --> 28:59.603
she couldn't move much, you see!

29:00.405 --> 29:02.773
It wasn't her fault.

29:04.042 --> 29:07.444
She tripped in a big, black hole.

29:07.879 --> 29:09.780
But,

29:10.548 --> 29:12.950
it wasn't the ones who moved her

29:13.217 --> 29:15.285
it was the ones who grew her,

29:15.553 --> 29:17.054
raised her.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.757
And after long

29:20.759 --> 29:23.327
she got weak in the knee

29:23.962 --> 29:27.464
do you know what they did?

29:29.267 --> 29:31.435
Do you know

29:31.437 --> 29:33.303
what they did!?

29:33.305 --> 29:35.138
Ahh!

29:39.410 --> 29:42.279
They watched that most

29:42.281 --> 29:44.314
beautiful creature

29:44.582 --> 29:46.316
die.

29:47.618 --> 29:50.153
And do you know why?

29:50.755 --> 29:52.556
Because with

29:52.924 --> 29:54.157
hunters like

29:54.159 --> 29:55.659
that one

29:56.627 --> 29:59.663
they would be next.

30:02.133 --> 30:03.867
Oh.

30:04.769 --> 30:06.837
The deal has changed.

30:10.441 --> 30:12.576
Ahhh!!

30:22.820 --> 30:26.356
They will never understand you, Cygnus.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.792
Not like I do.

30:28.794 --> 30:31.128
That's the killer, Cygnus.

30:31.130 --> 30:33.196
That one.

30:37.468 --> 30:39.503
Take this blade

30:39.505 --> 30:41.605
and end this.

30:43.174 --> 30:46.943
And your precious last arc
will be free forever.

30:47.812 --> 30:50.380
Refuse and...

30:51.716 --> 30:56.953
All those beautiful souls you hunt for

30:57.989 --> 31:00.390
will be...

31:01.225 --> 31:03.460
Well...

31:04.328 --> 31:06.930
So what will it be?

31:23.681 --> 31:25.782
That's it.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.762
There's the answer!

31:40.264 --> 31:41.698
You...

31:41.700 --> 31:44.134
Made a wise choice today.

31:51.042 --> 31:52.442
Today

31:52.444 --> 31:54.711
you made history.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.279
No!

32:00.051 --> 32:02.586
She will die.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.688
Then he will die.

32:05.289 --> 32:07.958
Then all the people he calls

32:07.960 --> 32:09.426
his people

32:09.428 --> 32:11.795
will die.

32:11.797 --> 32:13.296
Hm?

32:18.469 --> 32:20.804
Chain them up!

32:40.791 --> 32:42.826
I see what you fight for.

32:43.427 --> 32:45.829
Why didn't he kill you
when he saw I couldn't?

32:45.831 --> 32:48.498
They were promised power
where we're going.

32:48.799 --> 32:51.001
They want us alive.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.184
Black sand.

33:08.853 --> 33:11.521
Is this the place?

33:12.323 --> 33:14.858
Just a little further.

33:15.526 --> 33:17.460
Man left it there.

33:17.462 --> 33:18.895
For us?

33:19.864 --> 33:21.698
For all of us.

33:37.815 --> 33:40.717
Do you know what is in there?

33:42.186 --> 33:46.056
Everything their world had,
and their children do not.

34:07.678 --> 34:09.411
This

34:10.380 --> 34:13.250
is how it ends!

34:19.690 --> 34:21.824
Will this do?

35:44.175 --> 35:48.345
At least we still have time
before they try to get in.

35:50.848 --> 35:53.350
Now I can ask

35:53.617 --> 35:55.552
what is your name?

35:57.788 --> 35:59.656
Mari.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.691
A wolf without a pack.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.860
Packs hold me back.

36:04.328 --> 36:05.962
But

36:05.964 --> 36:08.698
I have heard of the last arc.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.901
I know them well.

36:13.804 --> 36:16.039
Are you with them?

36:21.011 --> 36:23.780
Are you with them!?

36:28.853 --> 36:30.720
They need me.

36:34.892 --> 36:37.093
And I need them.

36:42.666 --> 36:44.401
You mean that.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.110
My name is Cygnus.

36:59.517 --> 37:02.419
Like the constellation.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.858
You are far from home.

37:11.862 --> 37:14.230
Ahh! No!

38:06.817 --> 38:09.552
I know what you're thinking.

38:11.255 --> 38:13.656
You first.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.838
This is the same as above.

38:29.306 --> 38:32.041
It's how we got in.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.444
We got in because you pulled us

38:34.446 --> 38:36.646
to what could have been our deaths.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.048
Did we have another choice?

38:43.153 --> 38:45.522
Let's keep moving.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.869
Mari?

39:01.639 --> 39:03.706
Mari?

40:41.238 --> 40:43.239
That's terrible!

40:43.241 --> 40:46.275
You have been haunting me
with that since last night.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.077
It's based on a philosophy.

40:48.079 --> 40:49.479
The walls of this place

40:49.481 --> 40:51.314
will not protect all we knew.

40:51.316 --> 40:53.483
Only the most important thing.

40:53.485 --> 40:55.952
Why do you follow me with that thing?

40:55.954 --> 40:58.888
I can't see both your eyes,
I want to see your eyes.

40:59.990 --> 41:02.692
I want to see your eyes
like I saw them last night.

41:03.594 --> 41:05.328
James.

41:06.263 --> 41:08.264
Put it down.

41:08.266 --> 41:11.300
Put it down quickly.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.603
C'mon, put it down!

41:15.439 --> 41:18.274
You're crazy and you're mad.

41:18.276 --> 41:20.543
And god, I love you.

41:27.785 --> 41:30.119
It's not something we can find.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.654
Only something

41:31.656 --> 41:34.323
we can know in ourselves.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.359
Don't worry my child,

41:36.361 --> 41:38.461
that's what I am here for.

41:38.463 --> 41:40.630
I know she loves me.

41:40.632 --> 41:42.165
I know she's gone

41:42.167 --> 41:43.866
but she won't be long.

41:44.468 --> 41:45.868
She's my hero

41:45.870 --> 41:47.403
is what I told my class.

41:49.006 --> 41:51.841
She told me lots of people are
going to sleep these days

41:51.843 --> 41:53.976
because of the ocean.

41:53.978 --> 41:55.645
A crypt.

41:55.647 --> 41:57.747
Made when the season of man
came to an end.

41:59.883 --> 42:03.052
No one lives forever, my child.

42:03.554 --> 42:06.522
That's why life is so marvelous.

42:06.524 --> 42:09.826
And every day we live is a gift.

42:09.828 --> 42:11.661
I love it when she tells me stories

42:11.663 --> 42:14.664
about the whole big world that she sees.

42:14.666 --> 42:17.233
That little light deep in your heart,

42:17.235 --> 42:19.235
is your soul.

42:19.737 --> 42:23.306
Use it to make the world a better place.

42:25.743 --> 42:27.877
You're crazy and you're mad.

42:27.879 --> 42:31.013
And god, I love you.
And god, I love you.

42:31.015 --> 42:32.715
I love you so much.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.817
All things must come to a close.

42:35.352 --> 42:37.854
I just want her to come home.

42:37.856 --> 42:41.124
With love, the future is yours to make.

42:42.359 --> 42:45.061
This is an ode to the era we knew.

42:45.063 --> 42:48.965
To live to see the great day that dawns.

42:50.601 --> 42:53.102
No! No! No! No!

42:54.538 --> 42:56.439
No.

42:56.441 --> 42:58.374
Don't make this hard for me.

42:58.376 --> 42:59.942
She can't go to sleep.

42:59.944 --> 43:02.745
Let me see him. No!

43:02.747 --> 43:06.082
James, you've got to listen
to me, James, listen.

43:06.084 --> 43:08.251
I'm here now, alright?

43:08.253 --> 43:09.719
I'm going to give you my blood

43:09.721 --> 43:11.254
and you're going to be fine, okay?

43:11.256 --> 43:12.789
Stop!

43:12.791 --> 43:15.625
Because I'm not going to let you go.

43:16.426 --> 43:18.060
You hear me?

43:18.062 --> 43:20.997
I will never let go.

43:22.566 --> 43:24.734
I'm not going to let you go.

43:24.736 --> 43:26.502
I love you

43:30.974 --> 43:33.810
It's just a long walk you're going on.

43:34.478 --> 43:37.613
Anywhere in the world will be your home.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.983
It's just a long walk you're going on.

43:41.952 --> 43:44.487
This is the answer.

44:34.671 --> 44:36.572
Mari.

44:37.808 --> 44:39.909
What's wrong with you?

44:41.979 --> 44:44.080
They tried.

44:47.818 --> 44:50.386
They knew their time was up.

44:53.023 --> 44:54.924
Love.

44:57.027 --> 44:59.729
That is to be human.

45:00.564 --> 45:02.665
To give and be vulnerable.

45:02.667 --> 45:04.333
This is no different.

45:04.335 --> 45:06.068
This is, Cygnus!

45:07.504 --> 45:10.539
We have no future on this wasted planet!

45:10.541 --> 45:12.408
No, you need to understand...

45:13.210 --> 45:16.078
I saw the humans at the end of their days.

45:16.680 --> 45:19.782
If they can feel something, why can't I?

45:24.888 --> 45:27.590
It looks like you can.

46:06.263 --> 46:09.031
I want to say something

46:09.967 --> 46:12.802
but I don't know the words.

46:15.072 --> 46:17.206
Show me.

46:44.801 --> 46:46.902
Shh.

47:16.133 --> 47:18.300
I thought you could see everything

47:18.302 --> 47:20.236
without looking.

47:23.040 --> 47:25.941
You still think I can see everything?

47:26.643 --> 47:28.044
Come in.

47:50.067 --> 47:52.101
Why are you here?

47:55.372 --> 47:57.373
I have a question

47:57.375 --> 47:59.442
about some kids.

48:00.043 --> 48:02.211
What kids?

48:02.213 --> 48:04.880
- Us.
- No.

48:04.882 --> 48:06.215
Please, I...

48:06.217 --> 48:08.017
I can't.

48:08.019 --> 48:10.019
I insist.

48:10.021 --> 48:12.655
You've been spending way
too many days alone.

48:14.524 --> 48:17.860
In fact, me being here pestering you

48:17.862 --> 48:19.695
is good for your health.

48:19.697 --> 48:22.965
You are not good for my health.

48:25.936 --> 48:29.038
You know, a game

48:29.040 --> 48:32.274
can remind us how to play in life.

48:34.945 --> 48:37.613
- A game?
- Yeah.

48:38.248 --> 48:40.182
Okay, I...

48:40.450 --> 48:42.585
I call this one

48:42.587 --> 48:44.253
want,

48:44.255 --> 48:45.588
do,

48:45.590 --> 48:47.790
remember.

48:47.792 --> 48:49.792
I'll start.

48:52.229 --> 48:54.096
I remember...

48:55.800 --> 48:57.266
It goes in that order.

49:00.303 --> 49:02.471
I remember...

49:04.107 --> 49:07.309
The last time you were so focused.

49:07.978 --> 49:10.412
You would sleep-walk
in the night

49:10.414 --> 49:13.682
and always end up outside of my hut.

49:16.087 --> 49:19.388
I wasn't thinking clearly.

49:21.825 --> 49:23.659
Of course you weren't.

49:23.661 --> 49:25.528
You were asleep.

49:26.096 --> 49:28.364
Okay, my turn.

49:28.798 --> 49:30.966
I remember...

49:30.968 --> 49:33.102
When you

49:33.104 --> 49:35.671
were so caught up in your mind

49:35.939 --> 49:38.107
that you forgot to put the fire out

49:38.109 --> 49:39.975
and you just about burnt your hut down

49:39.977 --> 49:42.111
and we had to save you.

49:42.113 --> 49:43.479
I was meditating.

49:43.481 --> 49:45.181
You were naked!

49:45.183 --> 49:47.583
Doesn't change the fact.

49:50.453 --> 49:51.854
You're next.

49:51.856 --> 49:53.355
Now I'm done remembering.

49:58.361 --> 50:00.496
The next is, uh,

50:00.498 --> 50:02.898
want.

50:03.867 --> 50:05.768
I...

50:08.705 --> 50:11.574
I always wanted to

50:14.844 --> 50:17.146
create a tablet that

50:17.148 --> 50:19.615
tells the seasons.

50:20.317 --> 50:21.917
Hm.

50:24.487 --> 50:27.456
I've always wanted

50:28.058 --> 50:30.726
to spend more time in the water.

50:31.161 --> 50:32.928
Swimming deeply

50:33.897 --> 50:36.365
where the world accepts me for

50:36.367 --> 50:38.400
all I am.

50:47.844 --> 50:49.778
I accept you.

50:51.214 --> 50:53.249
Since we were little.

50:55.252 --> 50:57.486
They used to bother you.

50:59.189 --> 51:01.991
You saw what others didn't.

51:05.695 --> 51:08.264
I saw once that

51:08.698 --> 51:12.301
those two could have made quite a pair.

51:16.873 --> 51:18.941
So did he.

51:32.055 --> 51:33.622
One more thing.

51:35.792 --> 51:38.761
I didn't see this coming.

51:38.763 --> 51:41.463
And I can't see any further.

51:41.798 --> 51:43.799
But I remember

51:43.801 --> 51:45.501
telling Cygnus under a spell

51:46.102 --> 51:48.504
that somewhere dark,

51:50.907 --> 51:54.143
where there is light that has an answer

51:56.246 --> 51:59.481
I think it had something
to do with all of us.

52:30.113 --> 52:31.780
You know Cygnus

52:31.782 --> 52:34.850
lived a lonely life in the shadow too.

52:36.519 --> 52:39.421
I know you miss them, Elias.

52:41.658 --> 52:44.093
Whatever is happening now

52:44.627 --> 52:46.895
is more than any of us expected.

52:47.997 --> 52:49.531
Listen.

52:49.533 --> 52:51.934
We don't have a choice now.

52:52.869 --> 52:56.538
There was a time when we
weren't surrounded by death.

52:57.006 --> 52:59.808
If Cygnus finds a way

52:59.810 --> 53:02.578
then we are along the trail.

53:28.671 --> 53:30.906
I see us.

53:30.908 --> 53:33.442
This is who we are.

53:33.743 --> 53:36.412
The people of land and water.

53:36.746 --> 53:38.781
And that's it.

53:45.889 --> 53:47.956
There's nothing more.

53:49.058 --> 53:52.428
All we can do is move across this place

53:53.229 --> 53:55.597
all we can do is move

53:56.733 --> 53:58.934
and survive.

54:05.775 --> 54:07.976
Is that what you were looking for?

54:09.045 --> 54:10.646
Yes.

56:17.840 --> 56:19.775
Mari.

56:20.176 --> 56:22.911
You have to be careful
and protect yourself.

56:22.913 --> 56:24.913
They won't stop until someone's dead

56:24.915 --> 56:26.915
and I do not want it to be you.

56:28.017 --> 56:29.384
Cygnus.

56:29.386 --> 56:30.886
I'll teach you how to
get your bearings here

56:30.888 --> 56:32.521
so at least you can get back.

56:32.523 --> 56:33.889
So if I'm captured...

56:33.891 --> 56:35.223
Cygnus, stop.

56:35.225 --> 56:37.192
We don't know what's going to happen

56:37.194 --> 56:39.061
but as long as one of us
can make it back alive...

56:39.063 --> 56:40.829
Cygnus!

56:42.231 --> 56:44.466
I was set up to kill you.

56:52.742 --> 56:55.310
I had no choice.

57:02.785 --> 57:04.953
I protected your life.

57:05.622 --> 57:07.623
I know that.

57:08.725 --> 57:11.460
You are not who I thought you were.

57:11.462 --> 57:13.161
How would you know?

57:13.963 --> 57:15.564
Because you brought me back.

57:15.566 --> 57:17.399
From what?

57:17.401 --> 57:19.001
From dying.

57:21.237 --> 57:23.405
They took me in because I knew how to kill

57:23.407 --> 57:25.474
and then they made a deal with me.

57:30.079 --> 57:32.614
It wasn't my intent to join

57:32.616 --> 57:34.983
or belong or anything!

57:36.919 --> 57:40.155
I went with them to learn their secrets.

57:40.590 --> 57:44.993
Where they hunt, where they
hide, and then I would vanish.

57:46.095 --> 57:48.530
They set me up!

57:53.636 --> 57:55.303
I hunt too.

57:55.305 --> 57:56.938
I'm just like you!

57:56.940 --> 57:58.407
Yes!

57:58.775 --> 58:00.108
Yes!

58:00.110 --> 58:02.310
I am a killer!

58:02.312 --> 58:03.779
I kill!

58:03.781 --> 58:05.614
I hunt! I skin!

58:05.616 --> 58:09.518
But when my life was on the
line, I didn't think of myself.

58:10.787 --> 58:14.189
Everything I said to you
was the truth, Mari.

58:14.624 --> 58:17.192
Cygnus, I see you!

58:19.195 --> 58:21.563
You are not who I thought you were.

58:50.893 --> 58:53.628
Just the old scars, please.

58:55.665 --> 58:57.599
Okay.

58:59.068 --> 59:00.569
Hmm.

59:01.204 --> 59:02.838
I believe

59:02.840 --> 59:04.873
if I don't know the answer

59:04.875 --> 59:07.242
then my hands do.

59:11.547 --> 59:14.416
Good luck with your archiving, shappa.

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:15.911
This...

01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:17.913
This is where...

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:20.682
This is where they should
have been at the bluff.

01:00:22.919 --> 01:00:25.487
This is the river here...

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:30.125
Ugh!

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:34.830
Where are you, Cygnus?

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:50.572
They are right.

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:53.575
I am their hunter.

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:58.246
And I have a promise to keep.

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:12.160
Where does Cygnus fit?

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:14.696
The river

01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:16.598
is over here.

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:21.403
Unh!

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:23.438
Where did I go wrong?

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:46.461
Right there.

01:02:47.897 --> 01:02:49.464
Right there.

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:24.833
The snakes.

01:03:27.503 --> 01:03:29.371
Cygnus.

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:34.342
The end.

01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:39.681
It comes with him.

01:04:38.874 --> 01:04:41.309
- Shappa!
- Cygnus!

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:45.380
What did you find?

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.849
I found what they left behind.

01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:50.585
You should think me a scholar after all.

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:53.721
You're a hunter and a damned good one.

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:55.757
I'm just glad you're back.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:58.860
We'll see for how long.

01:04:58.862 --> 01:05:00.595
Come on!

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:09.564
Are you still the hunter?

01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:12.667
Whatever I am,

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:15.370
after what I saw,

01:06:16.672 --> 01:06:19.007
I see time differently now.

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:21.943
When you was gone,

01:06:21.945 --> 01:06:24.112
I thought you had come back in my dream.

01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:26.514
You was not killing no more.

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:36.524
You must have been dreaming.

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:39.961
You have to be ready

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:42.030
for what's about to happen.

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:44.766
You're going to go for a long walk.

01:06:45.467 --> 01:06:47.202
Okay?

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:51.139
Cygnus, I want to know

01:06:51.141 --> 01:06:53.441
where we go.

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:56.911
I know.

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:26.140
Is there a reason we haven't
scalped this village?

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:30.245
Are you

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:33.314
questioning my authority again?

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:42.757
We don't know how many are able to fight.

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:45.393
This isn't about them.

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:47.428
It's about him, right?

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:49.197
That's what you said.

01:07:49.199 --> 01:07:52.767
It has always been about them.

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:55.770
It's always been about your sweet,

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:58.106
golden future.

01:07:58.108 --> 01:07:59.874
But

01:07:59.876 --> 01:08:01.576
you,

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:03.678
you just want more.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:06.214
What we want

01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:08.950
is for this to end!

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:12.220
You want.

01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:16.591
You want! And want!
And want! And want!

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:18.393
And want!!

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:19.894
What you want

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.395
is me!

01:08:21.398 --> 01:08:23.665
You need me!

01:08:26.801 --> 01:08:29.136
You want the power, zizzik?

01:08:29.139 --> 01:08:31.272
Then take this

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:33.508
and go carve it out of them.

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:52.660
Almost there.

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:55.330
Almost there.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:58.433
So this crypt was built by humans?

01:08:58.435 --> 01:09:00.902
Yes. And left for us.

01:09:04.506 --> 01:09:06.506
Here.

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:08.676
It helped them get through

01:09:13.314 --> 01:09:15.082
Nova.

01:09:16.018 --> 01:09:18.086
It's me that they're after.

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:21.889
How do you know this?

01:09:23.024 --> 01:09:26.894
They would have killed me
when they had the chance.

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:54.122
Cygnus.

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:29.590
And I thought you were a lone wolf.

01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:41.969
If you feel nothing, then you survive.

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:46.641
But if you feel something...

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:51.179
Then you have something to live for.

01:11:56.612 --> 01:11:57.979
This

01:11:57.981 --> 01:12:00.414
is what you heart tells you?

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:04.952
Tell me how you met.

01:12:04.954 --> 01:12:07.788
By the edge of the blade.

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:10.091
How everyone else does.

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:12.760
Hm.

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:14.962
But...

01:12:14.964 --> 01:12:17.098
But I saw you.

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:21.936
I saw you too.

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:48.229
This

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:50.565
is the memories

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.067
that live

01:12:53.069 --> 01:12:55.436
where the blood bonds.

01:12:56.838 --> 01:12:59.574
Your story will be great.

01:13:01.209 --> 01:13:03.411
Do not be afraid.

01:13:03.413 --> 01:13:05.279
I never was.

01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:11.752
My heart recognizes her.

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:14.188
She is welcome.

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:48.623
Ah! Ah!

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:58.199
They're coming!

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:01.469
They are coming!

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:05.640
Warn them, warn them!

01:14:05.642 --> 01:14:07.508
They're sending the dead!

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:11.178
Where's the children?

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.161
Where're the baby?

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:29.463
If I don't come back,

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:31.265
lead them some place safe.

01:14:31.267 --> 01:14:33.801
If you don't come back,
I'm coming after you.

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:36.170
No. They need you here.

01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:39.573
Cygnus!

01:14:40.008 --> 01:14:42.143
No matter how we leave,

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:44.712
our echoes won't.

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:56.023
Nova!

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:27.221
Ahhh!

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:17.698
Look what beautiful things you have done.

01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:21.569
That's right, Cygnus.

01:17:22.103 --> 01:17:25.005
Anything you've always done

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:28.075
has always been right.

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:50.364
Cygnus!

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:01.308
No. No.

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:02.710
No!

01:18:02.712 --> 01:18:04.912
If you touch her, I will kill you.

01:18:05.146 --> 01:18:07.748
I will kill you! No!

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:10.551
No! Run!

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:13.354
Run!

01:18:13.356 --> 01:18:15.723
Run back! No!

01:18:15.725 --> 01:18:17.157
No!

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:19.159
Cygnus!

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:20.561
Ohh!

01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:32.740
He can't.

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:35.776
He needs to know what he is!

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:39.246
Look at me. Come on,
stay with me.

01:18:39.248 --> 01:18:40.848
Stay with me.

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:43.183
They say too much, Mari.

01:18:43.185 --> 01:18:46.086
I have to speak now!

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:49.089
I'm here. I'm here, Nova.
Nova, I'm here. Look at me.

01:18:49.091 --> 01:18:51.425
Okay? Look at me.

01:18:51.427 --> 01:18:53.294
I need to speak now.

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:03.604
Nova, what's happening to me!?

01:19:06.274 --> 01:19:09.109
You belong to us too.

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:13.314
We live through one another.

01:19:14.749 --> 01:19:16.317
Look!

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:30.164
My light is passing.

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:34.034
You have the ancestors in your eyes.

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:37.371
You lead them.

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:43.377
Tell Cygnus...

01:19:44.312 --> 01:19:48.182
Tell him he always belonged here.

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.586
He was never

01:19:52.588 --> 01:19:54.655
one of them

01:20:39.534 --> 01:20:41.602
you hear that?

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:44.204
That voice

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:47.374
that screams "let go".

01:20:50.845 --> 01:20:53.047
You can't silence it.

01:20:53.314 --> 01:20:55.616
It's a part of you.

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:59.119
The horse never wanted you.

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:02.890
You had hope in your eye.

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:06.994
But every last one

01:21:06.996 --> 01:21:10.631
of those pathetic souls

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:13.567
will suffer the same fate

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:17.237
as your snakes.

01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:22.076
You see...

01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:24.011
Our stories

01:21:24.013 --> 01:21:25.979
are the same.

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:32.286
Do you see why she never wanted you?

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:36.590
Who?

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:40.260
Our mother.

01:21:45.366 --> 01:21:46.900
No.

01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:49.770
No.

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:52.606
No!

01:21:53.942 --> 01:21:55.576
No!!!

01:21:55.578 --> 01:21:57.945
Yes, brother!

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:04.718
My entire life...

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.253
Everything!

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:08.255
All of this

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:10.190
has been you.

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:17.531
You were never one of them.

01:22:23.805 --> 01:22:25.906
Aahh!!

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:46.693
Just like me!

01:22:50.832 --> 01:22:53.167
You're just like me.

01:23:02.343 --> 01:23:04.711
What are you waiting for!?

01:23:06.514 --> 01:23:08.682
Get him off me.

01:23:11.119 --> 01:23:13.687
I said get him off me!

01:23:13.689 --> 01:23:15.355
Where is the power you promised us

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:18.025
to put the noose around
the killer's collar!?

01:23:18.027 --> 01:23:19.493
You took all you can!

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:23.197
You can't take us!

01:23:25.466 --> 01:23:27.401
Where are you going!?

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:31.038
Where are you going!?

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:34.441
You can't walk away!

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:45.452
Where do you think you're going?

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:49.122
Cygnus!

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:54.528
Wait!

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:57.931
Wait! Wait! Wait-wait-wait!

01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:00.901
Who do you think

01:24:00.903 --> 01:24:02.603
kept you alive all this time?

01:24:04.672 --> 01:24:07.307
Who looked out for you?

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:17.851
I just wanted you

01:24:17.853 --> 01:24:20.787
to be like me.

01:24:23.057 --> 01:24:25.559
This isn't for me.

01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:28.161
It's for them.

01:26:07.528 --> 01:26:11.965
Courage is the only thing
you need where you're going.

01:26:11.967 --> 01:26:14.201
Think I'll make it?

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:16.570
You've made it this far.

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:19.239
You'll see once you get there.

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:22.709
You're part of it too, you know?

01:26:23.544 --> 01:26:25.612
See.

01:26:26.814 --> 01:26:28.382
It's a gift.

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:46.333
You brave little warrior.

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:57.377
Nova.

01:26:57.379 --> 01:27:00.914
The answer is that we are not out of time.

01:27:00.916 --> 01:27:03.450
To feel is to live.

01:27:03.751 --> 01:27:05.752
To feel is to continue.

01:27:07.054 --> 01:27:10.457
The last arc will find its way.

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:13.493
And maybe one day I will find mine.

01:27:24.705 --> 01:27:27.507
What is the wind telling you, Cygnus?

01:27:31.946 --> 01:27:34.181
It's harder to hear now.

01:27:36.884 --> 01:27:38.351
Then

01:27:38.719 --> 01:27:41.521
something is about to change.

01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:46.960
Will you come with us?

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:55.135
I've seen enough.

01:28:23.764 --> 01:28:25.866
It's time we left.

01:28:28.135 --> 01:28:30.170
Then where do we go?

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.741
We go north.

01:28:35.305 --> 01:28:41.526
