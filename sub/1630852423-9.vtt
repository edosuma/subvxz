00:14.764 --> 00:15.890
You have a tiny penis.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.144
All balls, baby, all balls.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.570
Yeah, big spooky season vibes.

00:30.321 --> 00:33.700
You know how this morning I was like…
Things aren't going very well.

00:37.120 --> 00:42.042
Well, the new roommate
really was the little spark.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.669
One of the girls here expressed

00:44.753 --> 00:47.255
that she kind of
had a little crush on him.

00:47.338 --> 00:49.716
And then I…

00:50.800 --> 00:52.135
I got caught flirting with him.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.903
I don't feel like a snaky person
but maybe I am. I don't know.

01:52.654 --> 01:53.905
Kinda beat you there.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.739
<i>-You sound upset.</i>
<i>-I am.</i>

03:17.822 --> 03:18.907
<i>What's wrong?</i>

03:24.120 --> 03:27.165
-Have fun, you little kissing queens.
-Okay.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.674
What's that smell? Wait.
Something smells really familiar.

03:36.758 --> 03:37.842
Like patchouli.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.889
-Like what?
-Patchouli, you uneducated swine.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.515
I only know like five things.

03:45.683 --> 03:46.809
They're very useful.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.033
-Hope this goes good.
-Yeah.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.288
I'll holler at you. I'll see you later.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.789
Send Michael over.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.499
-What the fuck?
-I'm gonna kill it.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.835
-It's ugly and fat.
-It's gonna crunch.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.260
Isha also summoned you.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.221
I said, Isha summoned you.

05:48.473 --> 05:51.100
-Are you gonna go over there or not?
-Nah.

07:35.204 --> 07:38.749
-Freckles.
-Damn, Michael better mind his Ps and Qs.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.793
What are you talking about?

08:48.236 --> 08:50.571
-See you tomorrow.
-Good night, buddy.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.032
-Love you.
-Love you, guys.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.033
Love you, bro.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.407
It'll be too long though.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.409
It's Halloween,
I want to dress like a skank.

17:15.492 --> 17:18.162
I know. I feel you. I like this one.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.226
Nappy hour in an hour?

21:25.325 --> 21:28.036
I'm trying to put on these lashes
but it's not working.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.039
You guys look so cute!

21:31.123 --> 21:32.916
You look fucking hot!

21:33.500 --> 21:35.460
Girl, throw that thing at me
for good luck.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.631
Oh, shit! Natalie!

21:54.771 --> 21:58.108
Thank you. You're gonna save me.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.277
You're a lot better
than I thought you'd be.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.362
-I'm good at everything, Michael.
-I know.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.408
You have to get low to the ground.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.579
-Maybe I can go between your legs.
-Yeah. Probably.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.497
Maybe we'll save that for the bedroom.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.792
I feel like I'm gonna fall. Stop.

22:45.655 --> 22:48.283
My legs aren't burning,
that's why I'm doing it wrong.

22:48.366 --> 22:51.411
My back's hurting. Does that show my age?

22:51.495 --> 22:53.538
I shouldn't say that
when Brandon's here, right?

22:53.622 --> 22:54.498
No, do not.

23:01.755 --> 23:03.965
Brandon! Oh, my gosh, I can't stop.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.635
We're starting strong.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.345
Starting strong.

23:08.428 --> 23:09.888
You made it.

23:09.971 --> 23:13.975
You're so cute. Keke, I love it.
Have fun, babe.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.477
Go on and get him.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.729
You said you're good at skating, right?

23:17.813 --> 23:20.232
-Yeah, let's go. Pick up the pace.
-Oh, my gosh!

23:25.445 --> 23:27.864
-Where's your date?
-I don't know.

23:28.448 --> 23:29.699
Did he stand me up?

23:29.783 --> 23:31.576
No, don't say that.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.252
You caught your woman.

23:40.877 --> 23:42.129
I'm running away with her.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.308
Hey, Nat!

23:59.646 --> 24:01.439
-Zach, is that you?
-It's me.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.320
-I got you.
-How are you?

24:07.404 --> 24:09.489
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to finally meet you.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.243
-You look good.
-Well, thank you.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.211
I'm really bad, Zach, it's not even funny.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.963
-I'm actually bad.
-I'm bad too.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.548
You too? We both suck? Okay.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.300
-Should we hold hands?
-Yeah.

24:34.931 --> 24:37.809
That's Zach.
This is Keke, my alien brother.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.811
I would stop but I don't know how.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.773
-I'm so awkward.
-I know.

24:43.857 --> 24:46.193
You said, "I know"? Stop.

24:46.276 --> 24:47.485
Just giving you a hard time.

24:47.569 --> 24:48.737
Do you have any siblings?

24:48.820 --> 24:51.489
-I have three younger sisters.
-No wonder you're gay.

25:05.837 --> 25:08.632
I'm gonna let you see my real hands.
This is a big step.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.301
-This is very serious, okay?
-Okay.

25:12.594 --> 25:15.388
In the alien world,
we are not allowed to do this, but…

25:16.806 --> 25:18.350
-How do I look?
-You look gorgeous.

25:19.017 --> 25:21.770
Thank you, Zach.
You deserve a touch because of that.

25:23.271 --> 25:26.233
I like what we have going on obviously.

25:26.316 --> 25:27.901
We've been having a lot of fun,

25:27.984 --> 25:31.154
but do you think you're gonna stay here?

25:31.238 --> 25:34.866
I mean,
I definitely feel like I should stay here

25:34.950 --> 25:39.371
because everything's doing
really well with the boutique and…

25:39.454 --> 25:42.165
Right. You have a lot of momentum.

25:42.249 --> 25:45.001
You know, you got a whole rack at a place.

25:48.922 --> 25:52.926
It's just not really happening
for me here, you know?

25:53.009 --> 25:55.178
I think that after all this,

25:55.262 --> 25:58.223
I'm probably gonna
have to move back to LA.

25:59.599 --> 26:03.061
Just 'cause it's not really working
out here, career-wise, for me.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.815
-That's where I'm at right now.
-Like…

26:07.816 --> 26:10.485
Why LA? Why not somewhere else?

26:11.152 --> 26:13.530
My family is there, you know.

26:14.197 --> 26:15.740
It just seems like a right fit.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.996
It doesn't make sense for me to stay here.

26:21.079 --> 26:24.374
It just depends on how strong
you think our connection is.

26:24.457 --> 26:25.709
It feels real to me.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.129
Yeah, me too.

26:34.884 --> 26:37.721
I don't know what this is me saying.

26:37.804 --> 26:40.473
It's more just like
I wanted to let you know

26:40.557 --> 26:42.309
that that's kind of
where I'm at right now.

26:44.894 --> 26:46.354
I really like you,

26:46.438 --> 26:50.817
more than I've ever liked
anyone before, you know?

26:53.069 --> 26:55.947
If this was the end
and I didn't see you again,

26:56.031 --> 26:58.199
it would crush me.
