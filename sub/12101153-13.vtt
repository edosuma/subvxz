WEBVTT

00:01.479 --> 00:02.741
<i>Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:02.785 --> 00:04.830
I know that you all are trying
to stop Nyxly,

00:04.874 --> 00:07.137
<i>but we are supposed
to fight for everyone.</i>

00:07.181 --> 00:09.531
There's still time to make
a big difference.

00:09.574 --> 00:13.143
You have your mother's
witchcraft, should you choose
to embrace it.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.667
Nyxly wants to capture you
in her crystal,

00:15.711 --> 00:18.844
which she can use to find the
seven Totems that will give her
ultimate power.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.978
You need to help me find
the Totem of Courage.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.675
Because when you
control courage,

00:23.719 --> 00:25.025
you control fear.

00:29.464 --> 00:32.641
I wish Mxy's song
had given us
just a little bit more info,

00:32.684 --> 00:35.818
like, I don't know,
where to even start
looking for the Totems.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.083
Lena, you're back!

00:40.127 --> 00:41.128
How was Newfoundland?

00:41.563 --> 00:43.173
Um...

00:43.217 --> 00:44.522
Very quiet.

00:44.566 --> 00:47.351
Did you find anything else
about your mom?

00:47.395 --> 00:49.353
Honestly, it was kind of a lot
to process,

00:49.397 --> 00:51.442
so I'd prefer it if we could
just jump back into work

00:51.486 --> 00:53.314
and maybe you could bring me up
to speed?

00:53.357 --> 00:57.535
We're in a race against a
vengeful Fifth Dimensional Imp
named Nyxly

00:57.579 --> 01:01.583
to find seven Totems before she
can use them to wipe us out of
existence.

01:01.626 --> 01:03.585
I assume it's this Nyxly
that's responsible

01:03.628 --> 01:05.978
for the giant cat I saw on the
news?

01:06.022 --> 01:08.198
She was, and we have to stop
her.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.635
I was just gonna go to the
Fortress to see what info I
could find.

01:10.679 --> 01:13.073
- Do you wanna come?
- Sure.
Have portal, will travel.

01:15.031 --> 01:18.774
Access all Kryptonian knowledge
on the Fifth Dimensional
AllStone Totems.

01:22.691 --> 01:23.692
Here we go.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.218
Oh.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.830
- You know her?
- Yeah,
she's a Kryptonian witch.

01:33.615 --> 01:34.964
A witch?

01:35.007 --> 01:37.445
Well, the living memory of one.
Her name is Vita.

01:37.488 --> 01:41.057
Well, what does a Kryptonian
witch have to do with a Fifth
Dimensional Totem?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.972
Well, Fifth Dimensional energy
is magic.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.280
Is the term "magic" really
accurate?

01:47.324 --> 01:49.196
I mean, it's energy.

01:49.239 --> 01:51.720
There must be a scientific
logic to it. We just don't
understand it yet.

01:51.763 --> 01:54.766
You seek the AllStone
Totems?

01:54.810 --> 01:57.204
I advise you to stay away from
them.

01:57.247 --> 02:02.209
Seeking them on Krypton led to
the demise of many
in my coven.

02:02.252 --> 02:04.907
Well, we really don't have
choice.
So, how do we find them?

02:04.950 --> 02:07.649
Oh, if you choose
to seek the Totems,

02:07.692 --> 02:10.434
there are a few rules you must
know.

02:10.478 --> 02:15.091
Rule one, there is a prescribed
order to the Totems.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.137
The Courage Totem is first.

02:17.180 --> 02:20.096
- That must be the one
Nyxly is after.
- Rule two,

02:20.140 --> 02:24.927
the Totems have been concealed
as artifacts, hidden over time.

02:24.970 --> 02:29.018
Three. You must activate the
Totem before you can wield it.

02:29.061 --> 02:32.500
To do so, you must speak the
word <i>"Cgyrzyx."</i>

02:32.543 --> 02:33.718
Four.

02:33.762 --> 02:35.459
To fully control the Totem,

02:35.503 --> 02:38.897
you must submit yourself
to a test of character.

02:38.941 --> 02:41.900
This trial will take
a deep emotional toll.

02:41.944 --> 02:43.337
It will not be pleasant.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.643
Yeah, but we don't want to
control the Totems.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.689
We just want to protect them.

02:47.732 --> 02:50.039
How did the witches
in your coven
start their search?

02:50.082 --> 02:53.042
On Krypton, we discovered that
over the eons,

02:53.085 --> 02:57.873
these magical artifacts had an
effect on the cultures
that grew up around them.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.222
An artifact?
That could be anything.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.310
Correct.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.486
The Totems are formidable.

03:02.530 --> 03:05.359
May you survive your quest.

03:17.371 --> 03:20.635
Um, Dr. Lahr, this just came
from the museum's Grants
department.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.735
They terminated my funding.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.607
Oh! This is all Frank's fault.

03:36.651 --> 03:37.652
Your ex-partner?

03:39.001 --> 03:41.264
If Dr. Gale hadn't told
the grant committee

03:41.308 --> 03:42.874
that he was quitting
Project Bolt

03:42.918 --> 03:45.312
because he believed harvesting
lightning was too dangerous,

03:45.355 --> 03:48.880
then I'd still have plans for
the laser with him.

03:48.924 --> 03:52.057
Then we'd still have a project.

03:53.581 --> 03:55.496
So why don't you get the plans
back from him?

03:56.975 --> 03:58.020
I don't know.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.109
Maybe he's right.

04:00.152 --> 04:01.458
You don't know
if you don't try.

04:20.129 --> 04:21.565
- Zoinks!
- What took you so long?

04:21.609 --> 04:25.265
The shipment was delayed.
But it arrived.

04:25.308 --> 04:26.266
It did?

04:28.790 --> 04:31.140
The Courage Totem
is in Nationa City.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.578
Everything is in place.

04:34.622 --> 04:38.147
You'll enter the museum
by this lab, undetected.

04:38.190 --> 04:40.889
There's a gap in their security
when the shift change happens.

04:40.932 --> 04:42.543
That's your opening.

04:42.586 --> 04:45.807
Your target time is 12:52 p.m.
on the dot.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.288
You'll have exactly eight
minutes to steal it.

04:49.593 --> 04:50.812
Eight minutes?

04:52.379 --> 04:53.380
Oh!

04:53.423 --> 04:56.383
What an annoyingly
small window.

04:56.426 --> 04:59.168
Do the people of Earth
have to go through these

04:59.211 --> 05:02.606
ridiculously elaborate plans
every time they want something?

05:03.520 --> 05:04.956
- Hmm?
- People.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.047
You know, I could always use
one of these bad boys and--

05:09.091 --> 05:10.092
No!

05:12.529 --> 05:14.749
I need to do it quietly.

05:14.792 --> 05:18.230
The only chance Supergirl and
her friends have of finding the
Totems

05:18.274 --> 05:20.842
is if I give the game away.

05:22.887 --> 05:26.500
But thanks to my Mxy-powered
Crystal Ball,

05:26.543 --> 05:29.938
the Courage Totem is within my
grasp.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.854
And once I have it,

05:35.291 --> 05:38.381
my revenge will be only a few
Totems away.

05:41.428 --> 05:42.646
How'd you sleep?

05:42.690 --> 05:44.039
Good.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.388
Better than
the last few nights.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.999
Yeah.

05:48.043 --> 05:52.743
I know that I've been
processing, well, everything
the last few days.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.180
I just...

05:55.224 --> 05:57.661
I didn't realize how much I had
to process.

05:57.705 --> 06:01.622
You don't have to talk about it
unless you want to.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.668
I am starting to see things
more clearly,

06:04.712 --> 06:07.062
and define what it is
that I want for myself.

06:08.542 --> 06:09.543
So, thank you.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.545
For the space.

06:12.807 --> 06:13.982
And for the coffee.

06:14.025 --> 06:15.723
Yes, coffee's good.

06:17.899 --> 06:18.987
Uh...

06:20.075 --> 06:21.772
Oh, it's the Tower.

06:21.816 --> 06:25.297
Kara has a lead on the AllStone
Totems that Nyxly's after,
so...

06:25.341 --> 06:26.777
Hey, do you want to come along?

06:26.821 --> 06:28.344
I mean,
we could really use your
shield on this.

06:28.953 --> 06:29.954
Oh, I can't.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.696
I have my own mission today.

06:32.740 --> 06:36.047
We may have neutralized Rankin,
but the Ormfell Building is
still gone,

06:36.091 --> 06:38.572
and a lot of people in the
Heights lost their home.

06:38.615 --> 06:41.052
But Orlando has a plan.

06:41.096 --> 06:43.272
It is gonna take a lot of
fighting the city,

06:43.315 --> 06:45.405
and a lot of trust from the
neighborhood.

06:45.448 --> 06:49.060
So I promised him and Joey that
Guardian would be there to see
this through.

06:49.104 --> 06:50.627
You know,
they are very lucky to
have you.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.543
Do you need any help?
'Cause I can come.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.502
No, you go to the Tower.

06:56.328 --> 06:57.417
I got this.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.940
- Okay.

06:59.462 --> 07:00.420
Bye, babe.

07:01.725 --> 07:05.250
I tasked you with covering
the Super friends.

07:05.294 --> 07:08.036
You should have a sixth sense
when they're on
the move by now.

07:08.079 --> 07:09.690
I'm getting there
as fast as I can.

07:09.733 --> 07:12.127
And what about your story
on the
Minetten crime syndicate's

07:12.170 --> 07:14.303
latest move
into National City?

07:14.346 --> 07:16.218
You said you had an in to go
undercover?

07:16.261 --> 07:17.262
I did.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.090
I will.

07:19.134 --> 07:22.485
What happened to the
prize-winning journalist
I hired?

07:22.529 --> 07:25.749
The one who went undercover
with drug lords in Colombia.

07:27.098 --> 07:29.797
Embedded himself with rebels
in Kaznia.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.191
Hell, you were even undercover
when you came here.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.759
Where's that reporter?

07:35.803 --> 07:40.155
I asked you to track the
Super friends and you have
nothing to show for it.

07:41.112 --> 07:43.158
Make it...

07:43.724 --> 07:44.812
happen.

07:49.381 --> 07:50.382
Nia.

07:54.517 --> 07:55.475
Are you all right?

07:55.997 --> 07:56.998
I'm fine.

08:01.176 --> 08:04.701
We think that even if the
Courage Totem seemed like an
innocuous object

08:04.745 --> 08:06.311
before it was first hidden...

08:06.355 --> 08:08.400
Because it's a magical power
source, it could have evolved

08:08.444 --> 08:09.793
into a symbol of courage.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.708
So, I have run searches for
every known artifact

08:11.752 --> 08:13.623
having anything to do with
courage,

08:13.667 --> 08:15.886
from early human history to
present day.

08:15.930 --> 08:19.194
And I've cross-referenced it
with items that are still in
existence.

08:19.237 --> 08:21.501
Coming to you... now, Brainy.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.546
We apply my algorithm and we
get...

08:24.591 --> 08:28.072
64,427 possible
Totem locations.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.552
Great.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.859
So even at Supergirl's speed,
that would take us...

08:31.902 --> 08:34.688
Thirty-two days, two hours and
38 minutes to check them all.

08:35.906 --> 08:37.778
Unless, of course,
we hit the jackpot early.

08:40.215 --> 08:44.001
There's a partial facial
recognition at the Museum of
Science and Technology.

08:44.045 --> 08:45.829
There's a potential artifact
there.

08:47.309 --> 08:48.658
A slingshot.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.007
And not just any slingshot,

08:50.051 --> 08:52.227
the one David allegedly
used to kill Goliath.

08:52.619 --> 08:53.620
Jackpot.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.541
Hey.

09:03.325 --> 09:05.588
I know Andrea has been hounding
you about the Super friends.

09:05.632 --> 09:08.112
And I just got a hot tip
you may want to chase down

09:08.156 --> 09:10.071
at the Museum of Science and
Technology.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.907
Mitch,
you miscalculating moron.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.172
Right. Mitch?

09:24.825 --> 09:25.826
Mitch.

09:34.486 --> 09:36.488
Nyxly, hand the Totem over.

09:37.620 --> 09:38.795
No.

09:38.839 --> 09:39.840
This one's mine.

09:41.058 --> 09:42.059
Better luck next time.

09:49.414 --> 09:50.590
<i>Cgyrzyx.</i>

09:54.463 --> 09:56.117
The rest of the troops
are in the armory, sister.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.599
No!

10:02.950 --> 10:03.951
What have you done?

10:04.691 --> 10:05.605
Mitch, now!

10:18.835 --> 10:21.011
This is incredible.

10:21.055 --> 10:24.711
Whatever the Totem is, it's
radiating concentrated Fifth
Dimensional energy.

10:25.712 --> 10:26.756
Man, that can't be good.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.192
Well, maybe Vita can tell us
more.

10:31.761 --> 10:32.632
All right.

10:34.111 --> 10:35.722
How does this work exactly?

10:41.075 --> 10:42.685
Brainy, are you okay?

10:42.729 --> 10:44.034
Hush, child.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.297
The Coluan...

10:47.472 --> 10:48.865
is fine.

10:48.909 --> 10:52.303
Vita, did you possess Brainy?

10:52.608 --> 10:54.784
Hmm.

10:54.828 --> 10:58.614
It's quite refreshing to be
embodied.

11:00.398 --> 11:02.226
Don't fret.

11:02.270 --> 11:04.707
I'll put him back the way I
found him.

11:07.536 --> 11:08.406
What are these?

11:09.103 --> 11:10.626
His nipples?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.236
- We need to get the witch
out of him now.
- I'm on it.

11:13.237 --> 11:14.848
Right. Hey, Vita?

11:14.891 --> 11:16.850
- Hmm. Yes, child?
- Vita, we need your help.

11:16.893 --> 11:19.548
We accidentally broke the
Courage Totem,

11:19.591 --> 11:21.724
and now there's
Fifth Dimensional energy
coming out of it.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.639
Well, that wasn't wise.

11:23.683 --> 11:27.512
Breaking the Totem
unleashes its magic.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.952
Anyone within a close radius
when it broke will be given

11:31.995 --> 11:36.521
a boost of raw,
unfiltered courage.

11:36.565 --> 11:39.002
All those people at the museum
have been affected.

11:39.046 --> 11:42.005
We could see erratic, even
violent behavior
all over the city.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.746
We were there, too.
Why weren't we affected?

11:43.790 --> 11:45.356
We'll monitor just to be safe.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.706
Vita. Hey, Vita!

11:46.749 --> 11:47.663
Hmm.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.969
How do we reverse it?

11:49.012 --> 11:51.493
By gaining control
of your half of the Totem.

11:52.494 --> 11:53.538
You understand?

11:53.582 --> 11:55.366
This will attract the other
half.

11:55.410 --> 11:56.498
You follow?

11:56.541 --> 11:59.675
Unite them...
and quell the magic.

12:01.416 --> 12:05.289
And to gain control,
I have to pass that gauntlet?

12:05.333 --> 12:08.292
Someone's paying attention
to what I've been saying.

12:08.336 --> 12:11.818
Yeah, man. If you are
successful, you'll gain full
command of the Totem.

12:11.861 --> 12:15.604
So I have to pass my gauntlet
before Nyxly passes hers.

12:16.213 --> 12:17.519
It will not be easy.

12:19.521 --> 12:23.003
You'll pay a terrible
emotional price.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.788
And if you fail,

12:25.832 --> 12:29.661
the Totem's erratic magic
will surge in everyone

12:29.705 --> 12:32.012
who was near the Totem when it
broke.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.883
Hey... We're gonna help you.

12:33.927 --> 12:36.756
Ha! Yeah, right. Rubbish!

12:36.799 --> 12:41.761
She who broke the Totem
must run the gauntlet...

12:42.413 --> 12:43.327
alone.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.155
Oh, dear.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.292
Got it. I've got it!

12:54.948 --> 12:57.602
- Brainy, are you okay?
- What happened?

12:57.646 --> 12:59.779
- Where am I?
- You okay?

12:59.822 --> 13:01.737
I did not like that.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.784
I will go and make sure that
Vita can't make any more
unscheduled appearances.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.611
Nia,

13:06.655 --> 13:08.483
go help Alex and J'onn
try to find Nyxly. I'll go...

13:09.789 --> 13:11.442
pay my emotional price.

13:17.535 --> 13:18.449
Okay.

13:20.712 --> 13:21.626
What was the word again?

13:25.282 --> 13:26.109
<i>Cgyrzyx.</i>

13:29.286 --> 13:32.420
<i>Face your past...
Face yourself...</i>

13:32.463 --> 13:34.814
<i>Face the moment you lacked
true courage.</i>

13:34.857 --> 13:37.033
What does that mean?

13:37.077 --> 13:40.863
<i>Shortly after takeoff,
National City Airlines flight
237</i>

13:40.907 --> 13:44.998
<i>bound for Geneva
is experiencing
some loss of altitude.</i>

13:45.041 --> 13:49.306
<i>The pilot seems to be
circling the city after
apparent engine failure.</i>

13:49.350 --> 13:50.830
This is the night I became
Supergirl.

13:51.743 --> 13:52.832
Alex was on that plane.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.611
Help! Somebody,
please help me!

14:33.655 --> 14:34.569
I remember this.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.181
I didn't go
because I was afraid
I'd be seen.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.665
I don't have any cash.

14:48.975 --> 14:49.889
You're safe now.

14:50.802 --> 14:51.673
I'll call the police.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.768
<i>You have failed.</i>

15:11.345 --> 15:12.172
Ahem.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.914
Dr. Lahr? What do you want?

15:14.957 --> 15:19.048
I want you to give me the plans
for finishing
the plasma ionizer.

15:19.092 --> 15:20.571
I know you've got them on your
hard drive.

15:21.616 --> 15:24.967
No. Project Bolt
is too dangerous.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.100
Now, if you can't see that,
then you leave me no choice.

15:27.143 --> 15:30.625
I'm going to wipe this hard
drive clean, and then no one
can access the plans.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.630
Then you leave me no choice.

15:40.461 --> 15:41.636
<i>Cgyrzyx.</i>

15:48.121 --> 15:51.211
<i>Face your past...
Face yourself...</i>

15:51.254 --> 15:56.042
<i>Face the moment you lacked
true courage.</i>

15:56.085 --> 15:57.826
The rest of the troops
are in the armory, sister.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.612
It's the day of the coup.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.832
They await our command.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.181
Are you
so sure about that?

16:07.923 --> 16:11.579
I don't think these traitors
are in any condition to fight.

16:16.627 --> 16:20.457
You... Thought you could pull
off a coup?

16:22.111 --> 16:23.286
You know what that makes me?

16:25.375 --> 16:26.333
Proud, son.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.074
You've got spine.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.860
But you...

16:31.903 --> 16:33.775
For a daughter to betray
her father like this?

16:34.863 --> 16:36.212
It's unforgivable.

16:37.213 --> 16:38.214
Throw her in the dungeon.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.003
Now, son.

16:45.787 --> 16:46.614
Father!

16:52.533 --> 16:54.796
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

17:08.897 --> 17:10.507
<i>You have failed.</i>

17:12.727 --> 17:13.554
No...

17:22.084 --> 17:23.999
Give me the hard drive.

17:24.478 --> 17:25.522
Now!

17:25.566 --> 17:27.046
Put that bottle down, now.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.743
Not until I get what I want!

17:48.850 --> 17:50.504
Sweet, another dragon!

17:50.547 --> 17:51.418
Sweet?

17:51.461 --> 17:52.419
Yeah.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.377
This one's mine.

17:54.421 --> 17:55.335
Alex, wait!

17:59.295 --> 18:00.731
Go get him, Alex!

18:00.775 --> 18:03.082
That dragon is gonna barbecue
her unless we stop it.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.084
Can you calm it psychically?

18:05.127 --> 18:07.695
I admire your concern
for your sister, Supergirl.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.566
And can I just say how proud I
am

18:09.610 --> 18:12.091
to have watched you both grow
into the strong women you are
today?

18:13.570 --> 18:14.484
Hang in there, Alex!

18:20.969 --> 18:24.407
Don't! I told you,
harnessing lightning
is too dangerous.

18:24.451 --> 18:25.278
Give it to me!

18:30.283 --> 18:31.284
I didn't see that coming.

18:35.810 --> 18:38.378
Good hit. Uh, Mr. Dragon, sir?

18:38.421 --> 18:40.641
Two minutes of your time.
Just two minutes. Two minutes.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.513
So, look.

18:43.557 --> 18:45.994
I know you've got a lot of rage
going on inside of you,

18:46.037 --> 18:48.127
but you don't really want
to hurt these people.

18:49.258 --> 18:50.129
Nice catch.

18:50.607 --> 18:51.521
Gotta go.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.871
Alex, come back!
What's going on?

18:56.439 --> 18:57.614
J'onn.

18:58.398 --> 18:59.921
That looks like fire.

19:04.447 --> 19:07.494
J'onn, are you trying
to reason with the dragon?

19:07.537 --> 19:08.712
We need to save everyone.

19:08.756 --> 19:11.672
So could you please just calm
them down?

19:11.715 --> 19:14.675
You're right, you're right.
These people must be so scared.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.372
- But they're being so brave--
- J'onn!

19:17.068 --> 19:17.895
Right.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.128
She got it.

19:34.347 --> 19:35.435
I'm gonna get a coffee.

19:36.871 --> 19:37.698
Get a coff...

19:38.916 --> 19:39.917
What happened here?

19:41.267 --> 19:43.007
Okay, I've confirmed it.

19:43.051 --> 19:45.140
There was Fifth Dimensional
energy present at the coffee
shop.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.187
Which is in the museum.
The Totem.

19:48.230 --> 19:51.059
Everyone there must have been
affected,
including some of you.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.235
Us? How?

19:53.279 --> 19:56.673
Well, Vita told us that anyone
around the Totem when it split

19:56.717 --> 19:57.892
could be impacted.

19:59.023 --> 20:00.721
So what if we were affected?

20:00.764 --> 20:03.158
I mean, how bad can overly
courageous superheroes really
be?

20:03.202 --> 20:06.074
Alex, you ran into the dragon's
fire.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.296
Alex is such a courageous hero.

20:10.339 --> 20:14.038
Yeah, who's usually a class-A,
glass-half-shattered realist.

20:14.082 --> 20:16.345
And look at her now.

20:16.389 --> 20:20.480
The Totem must've given her the
courage to be dangerously
optimistic.

20:20.523 --> 20:22.003
And you encouraged her!

20:22.046 --> 20:25.049
I'm just so impressed by her
initiative.

20:25.093 --> 20:27.617
I have to say,
I'm impressed by all of you.

20:27.661 --> 20:30.316
You're inspirations,
each and every one of you.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.883
How you handled yourselves,
you make me feel--

20:34.233 --> 20:36.278
- Oh. I see.
- Yeah.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.628
Having the courage to openly
express your feelings is--

20:38.672 --> 20:40.717
Hurting your ability
to make quick decisions.

20:40.761 --> 20:43.329
Well, at least you and Brainy
seem to be okay.

20:48.682 --> 20:51.032
I can't wake Nia.

20:51.075 --> 20:55.079
I think she's accessed a dream
state deeper than she ever has
before.

20:55.123 --> 20:57.560
Because she has the courage to.

20:57.604 --> 21:01.085
Vita told me if I failed my
gauntlet, the effects would
worsen.

21:01.129 --> 21:04.741
Hey, go easy on yourself.
You will pass your test.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.918
And Lena and I can contain the
Totem's energy until you do.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.398
Alex, J'onn, you should
monitor the city.

21:09.442 --> 21:12.923
There might be more incidents
like the coffee shop.

21:12.967 --> 21:16.318
Brainy, he has turned into
such a wonderful leader.

21:17.754 --> 21:20.322
See? Come on.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.585
There's nothing to worry about.

21:22.629 --> 21:25.501
- We got this.
- These guys...

21:28.939 --> 21:30.637
I don't understand.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.989
I know what this test is asking
of me.

21:35.032 --> 21:38.732
In real life, I didn't have the
courage

21:38.775 --> 21:41.648
to kill my father when he
betrayed me.

21:41.691 --> 21:45.565
But this time I did.

21:45.608 --> 21:48.394
So why didn't it work?

21:48.437 --> 21:53.616
Why force me to go through this
horrid moment if I can't even
have control

21:53.660 --> 21:55.357
of this bloody Totem!

21:55.401 --> 21:57.794
Well, maybe you killed
the wrong guy.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.667
Maybe you should've killed your
brother?

22:00.710 --> 22:03.844
What? How dare you?

22:03.887 --> 22:08.065
I'm sorry. I just thought...
But didn't you say
he betrayed you, too?

22:12.766 --> 22:13.680
He did...

22:17.423 --> 22:19.555
but I could never kill him.

22:20.513 --> 22:23.472
Well, maybe that's the test.

22:23.516 --> 22:26.823
Killing the thing you hate is
hard, but not nearly
as hard as

22:26.867 --> 22:29.086
killing the thing you love the
most.

22:38.226 --> 22:39.053
Hey.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.012
Any luck with your trials?

22:42.056 --> 22:43.492
Oh.

22:43.536 --> 22:46.103
No, not even a little.

22:46.147 --> 22:47.844
How about you and Brainy?

22:47.888 --> 22:49.846
Have you managed
to contain the Totem's energy?

22:49.890 --> 22:51.500
Not exactly.

22:51.544 --> 22:54.677
I'm actually on my way
to talk to our friend Vita.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.331
Hmm.

22:56.375 --> 23:00.117
Well, at least you two haven't
been affected by the Totem.

23:00.161 --> 23:03.077
I wish we had an explanation
for why I can't
pass this gauntlet.

23:06.254 --> 23:10.389
The test wants me to overcome
a moment where
my courage failed.

23:10.432 --> 23:15.219
It's the night I made my first
save as Supergirl, when I saved
Alex's plane.

23:15.263 --> 23:17.396
That doesn't sound
like a moment
where you lacked courage.

23:17.439 --> 23:21.269
Right? I feel like
I was most courageous then.

23:21.312 --> 23:22.923
There's gotta be
something more.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.535
What do I do?

23:26.579 --> 23:28.885
If I try again and fail,
people could get really hurt.

23:28.929 --> 23:31.410
But then if I don't try...

23:31.453 --> 23:34.108
The Imp could get the Totem
and all the magic it contains.

23:36.545 --> 23:38.460
Do you really not believe in
magic?

23:40.767 --> 23:42.333
I believe in you.

23:43.596 --> 23:44.901
And in all of us.

23:44.945 --> 23:48.383
We'll defeat this,
no matter what it's called.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.037
Now, if you'll excuse me,

23:50.080 --> 23:52.909
I have to go interrogate
a Kryptonian witch.

23:53.475 --> 23:54.520
Have fun.

24:13.669 --> 24:14.844
<i>Cgyrzyx.</i>

24:20.371 --> 24:24.506
<i>The pilot seems to be
circling the city after
apparent engine failure.</i>

24:24.550 --> 24:25.855
Let's try this again.

24:36.692 --> 24:37.998
<i>You have failed.</i>

24:49.836 --> 24:53.622
I can't believe Dr. Gale
was afraid this wouldn't work.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.363
Shouldn't we run tests first?

24:57.365 --> 24:59.498
Have a little courage.

24:59.541 --> 25:02.152
If we know we can harness
lightning...

25:10.204 --> 25:11.335
...why wait?

25:34.968 --> 25:36.709
Back to this, then.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.406
Vita, we need your help
containing

25:38.449 --> 25:40.669
the Fifth Dimensional energy
from the broken Totem.

25:42.628 --> 25:45.021
You mean Fifth Dimensional
Magic.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.067
Whatever you want to call it.

25:47.110 --> 25:49.286
It's coming from the Totem, and
you have the knowledge to help
me stop it.

25:49.330 --> 25:52.551
I'm not the only one here
with access to magic.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.902
Relax, child.

25:56.903 --> 26:02.082
Your secrets are safe with me.

26:03.300 --> 26:06.042
But I'm afraid
I can't help you.

26:06.086 --> 26:11.526
I don't have command
over Fifth Dimensional magic.

26:11.570 --> 26:16.705
However, there are
powerful witches who do.

26:16.749 --> 26:20.143
Even those oblivious to their
abilities.

26:21.623 --> 26:26.715
If a reluctant Earth witch
was to accept her gift

26:26.759 --> 26:29.588
and harness her magic,

26:29.631 --> 26:33.243
her powers could be strong
enough.

26:33.287 --> 26:37.030
So, you mean,
she should protect
herself from the Courage Totem

26:37.073 --> 26:39.685
and help defeat the Fifth
Dimensional Imp?

26:39.728 --> 26:42.513
Depends on how powerful
the witch,

26:42.557 --> 26:45.386
and how far
she's willing to go.

26:45.429 --> 26:50.217
Magic is unreliable.
There are safer alternatives
like science.

26:50.260 --> 26:52.828
Magic tramples universal laws
of science.

26:52.872 --> 26:55.570
You saw it with your own eyes.

26:55.614 --> 26:59.661
Now, where is that Coluan?

26:59.705 --> 27:03.317
Oh, I'd love another trip
into a body.

27:16.852 --> 27:18.680
This storm came on fast.

27:18.724 --> 27:22.205
It's not following any form of
normal weather pattern, either.

27:22.249 --> 27:25.295
There's been 13
ground lightning strikes
in the past six minutes.

27:25.339 --> 27:27.515
If this storm clusters,
we could be looking at
a single discharge

27:27.558 --> 27:28.995
of over 1,000 megajoules.

27:29.038 --> 27:32.215
It's 50 times the strength
of an average strike.

27:32.259 --> 27:34.435
It's enough to wipe out
every power grid in the city.

27:34.478 --> 27:36.655
Do you think the Totem
has something to do with this?

27:36.698 --> 27:39.483
Supergirl, I know you like to
take things all on your own
shoulders.

27:39.527 --> 27:40.789
But this is not your fault.

27:40.833 --> 27:43.400
Actually, it might be.

27:43.444 --> 27:45.054
Hold that thought.

27:45.098 --> 27:48.928
At the coffee shop, I overheard
two scientists arguing about

27:48.971 --> 27:50.886
something that could "harness
lightning."

27:50.930 --> 27:53.672
If they had such a device,
it could trigger a mega-storm.

27:53.715 --> 27:57.066
Find them. Cross-reference the
security cam footage at the
museum

27:57.110 --> 27:58.633
with facial recognition.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.548
If they started this,
they can tell us
how to stop it.

28:02.332 --> 28:03.682
How do I pass you?

28:07.424 --> 28:08.687
Throw her in the dungeon.

28:22.526 --> 28:23.353
Come on.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.834
Now, son.

28:29.664 --> 28:30.796
I trusted you.

28:34.887 --> 28:36.149
I trusted you.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.066
And you betrayed me.

28:40.806 --> 28:43.243
You were my baby brother.

28:43.286 --> 28:46.725
There's nothing I wouldn't have
done to protect you.

28:49.075 --> 28:50.729
I raised you.

28:52.295 --> 28:54.907
I wasn't just your sister.

28:57.605 --> 29:01.391
I was your most loyal friend.

29:01.435 --> 29:04.003
And this is how you repay me?

29:04.046 --> 29:08.224
You're going to just turn away
from me?

29:08.268 --> 29:10.792
I would never have
betrayed you.

29:10.836 --> 29:13.055
I would never have hurt you.

29:13.099 --> 29:17.190
I would never have turned my
back on you.
Especially for him.

29:18.452 --> 29:20.280
I would've died for you.

29:22.499 --> 29:24.414
I did die.

29:26.503 --> 29:27.374
Right here.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.336
You destroyed everything.

29:35.382 --> 29:36.905
You destroyed me.

29:46.393 --> 29:47.960
What happened?

29:48.003 --> 29:50.179
I broke down
and told my brother

29:51.006 --> 29:53.400
how his betrayal destroyed me.

29:55.489 --> 29:56.359
I failed.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.319
Must've been hard.

30:07.893 --> 30:11.766
<i>You have performed
admirably.</i>

30:12.723 --> 30:13.550
That was it.

30:15.204 --> 30:16.031
The test.

30:17.772 --> 30:20.688
That was what they meant by
courage.

30:22.908 --> 30:25.519
The courage to be vulnerable.

30:30.176 --> 30:31.917
Nyxly passed her test.

30:46.714 --> 30:48.542
Do we have anything to contain
this?

30:49.848 --> 30:51.371
To keep it here?

30:51.414 --> 30:52.938
This wasn't enough to hold its
magic,

30:52.981 --> 30:55.114
but it should be able
to contain the Totem
physically.

30:57.551 --> 30:58.595
I found the scientist.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.035
Dr. Beatrice Lahr.

31:03.078 --> 31:06.908
She was working on
Project Bolt, an attempt
to harness lightning energy...

31:06.952 --> 31:09.302
until she lost her funding this
morning.

31:09.345 --> 31:10.738
It has to be her.

31:10.781 --> 31:13.132
I've also dialed in
on the epicenter of the storm.

31:13.175 --> 31:16.613
It's right above the Tower.

31:16.657 --> 31:19.138
No, Brainy, it's not. It's not
even close.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.750
That's your fourth
miscalculation today.

31:22.793 --> 31:26.014
Brainy! You give us flawless
calculations every day.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.886
You're allowed to make mistakes
from time to time.

31:27.929 --> 31:28.887
No, he's not.

31:29.931 --> 31:31.237
You've been affected by the
Totem.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.934
That's ridiculous.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.023
What's the one thing a Coluan
doesn't have the courage to do?

31:35.067 --> 31:36.720
Be wrong in his calculations.

31:36.764 --> 31:37.896
Oh...

31:37.939 --> 31:43.075
Have I just spent all day
guesstimating?

31:43.118 --> 31:45.904
I appreciate your newfound
courage, but we need to have a
plan.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.907
Alex... Where's Alex?

31:50.778 --> 31:52.258
She must have rushed out.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.174
That is just like her.

31:55.217 --> 31:57.263
Always thinking of others
before herself.

31:57.306 --> 32:00.527
I've located the epicenter of
the storm. It's clustering over
the waterfront.

32:00.570 --> 32:01.832
Let's go.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.704
Hopefully, we can find
Dr. Lahr and Alex there.

32:15.542 --> 32:16.456
It's working.

32:20.808 --> 32:23.854
Hey! It's not safe here.

32:31.297 --> 32:32.341
Dr. Lahr!

32:34.561 --> 32:36.432
You're going to electrocute
this whole city.

32:36.476 --> 32:40.349
You sound just like my
ex-partner, and I will prove
you both wrong.

32:45.659 --> 32:47.313
Tell us how to stop the storm.

32:47.356 --> 32:50.055
You just ruined my life's work!

32:52.144 --> 32:53.188
Bummer.

32:53.232 --> 32:55.016
Look, I feel your frustration.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.583
- Do you want to talk about it?

32:58.933 --> 33:01.109
<i>Supergirl, that last
strike was 800
megajoules.</i>

33:01.153 --> 33:03.242
At this rate,
we're minutes away from
a strike that could electrify

33:03.285 --> 33:04.504
the whole harbor and anyone
nearby.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.474
Lena, release the Totem.

33:19.519 --> 33:21.042
You can still pass the test.

33:21.086 --> 33:24.306
But if I fail, it will get
worse.

33:24.350 --> 33:27.092
I need my team functional.
I need Dr. Lahr helpful.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.964
And none of that will happen
unless the Totem was restored.

34:02.605 --> 34:03.563
That can't be good.

34:04.172 --> 34:05.043
Welcome back.

34:06.348 --> 34:07.958
I am so sorry.

34:08.002 --> 34:09.873
I just had to prove
I could harness lightning.

34:09.917 --> 34:12.876
But now that I've supercharged
this storm, it'll just keep
growing.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.227
There's got to be some way we
can stop it.

34:15.270 --> 34:18.230
Um... If we had a negative
ionizer,

34:18.273 --> 34:20.884
that might prevent the storm
from getting bigger.

34:20.928 --> 34:23.061
Sentinel, the hand of the
soldier can morph into that.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.063
Be careful.

34:25.106 --> 34:27.543
Don't worry, I've got her back.

34:28.631 --> 34:30.329
Lena said you needed backup.

34:30.372 --> 34:31.417
Glad you're here, Guardian.

34:32.418 --> 34:35.073
Now for the remaining cloud
cluster.

34:35.116 --> 34:38.380
Brainy,
if Supergirl circles it,
what's the probability

34:38.424 --> 34:40.730
of creating an inverse function
to disperse it?

34:40.774 --> 34:42.906
At Mach 4? 87.6%.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.952
Well, what are the odds if you,
me and J'onn doing together?

34:44.995 --> 34:46.388
Excellent thinking,
I'm on my way.

34:48.216 --> 34:50.523
All right,
you'll be safer in the van.

34:50.566 --> 34:52.133
- In the...
- Yes.

35:18.681 --> 35:19.813
Now that's what
I call teamwork.

35:50.017 --> 35:50.931
It was Nyxly.

35:52.628 --> 35:58.286
I don't know how,
but I could feel her emotions.

35:58.330 --> 36:03.465
She was triumphant,
yet still vengeful.

36:03.509 --> 36:06.164
Determined more than ever
to get her hands
on the next Totem.

36:06.207 --> 36:07.643
I couldn't begin to explain it,

36:07.687 --> 36:11.299
but it is possible
that restoring the Totem

36:11.343 --> 36:14.302
created a psychic connection
between you and Nyxly.

36:14.346 --> 36:15.912
I can't find anything wrong.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.871
And your vitals are normal.

36:17.914 --> 36:21.135
Really? She just fainted due to
a psychic bond with Fifth
Dimensional Imp.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.181
Exactly.

36:23.224 --> 36:26.575
So whatever's happening between
you and Nyxly, our monitors
can't detect it.

36:26.619 --> 36:28.969
So do you think Nyxly senses
you, too?

36:29.622 --> 36:30.449
I think so.

36:32.494 --> 36:34.192
And I think to fight her,

36:34.235 --> 36:36.194
I'm going to need every bit of
power I can find,
and then some.

36:38.674 --> 36:40.633
What's with all the old
stories?

36:40.676 --> 36:45.725
This is actually the first time
I've been able to read this
article since...

36:46.378 --> 36:48.945
Eve Tessmacher shot you.

36:48.989 --> 36:52.427
Honestly, I almost didn't even
remember how it happened,

36:52.471 --> 36:53.385
I buried so much.

36:55.300 --> 36:58.999
I, um... just wanted to push
past it.

36:59.042 --> 37:03.221
And then today for some reason,
I had the courage to get out
there again.

37:03.264 --> 37:07.877
Well, I heard that the artifact
that was stolen from the museum

37:07.921 --> 37:10.271
came with a sort of curse.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.142
It made everyone in the area
more courageous.

37:14.144 --> 37:16.234
Maybe it was a curse,

37:16.277 --> 37:20.673
but it forced me to really face
everything I had gone through
for the first time

37:20.716 --> 37:22.718
and actually walk through it.

37:22.762 --> 37:23.980
That's great, Will.

37:24.024 --> 37:27.506
Yeah. And this time
I get back on the horse.

37:27.549 --> 37:30.204
I heard about your crime
syndicate beat.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.249
You going undercover?

37:32.728 --> 37:36.428
- No, better.
- Do tell.

37:36.471 --> 37:39.648
I am going to ask the Super
friends if I could be embedded
with them.

37:41.128 --> 37:44.174
I know,
but think of the access.

37:44.218 --> 37:47.221
And I know the hardest part is
getting them to agree to it...

37:48.266 --> 37:50.137
but Kara knows Supergirl.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.400
And you don't get anywhere
if you don't ask.

37:52.444 --> 37:53.271
Thank you for your help.

38:00.321 --> 38:06.153
Here you go.
You may have a scar.
But, I mean, I'm into it.

38:06.196 --> 38:07.110
I know you are.

38:09.069 --> 38:12.115
- Yeah.
- I am really, really grateful

38:12.159 --> 38:14.335
that you showed up tonight,
but you really didn't have to.

38:14.379 --> 38:18.687
Just because you didn't call me
for help doesn't mean
I won't be there.

38:19.514 --> 38:20.733
I just, you know...

38:20.776 --> 38:22.343
I know how important
today's work was for you

38:22.387 --> 38:24.519
and I didn't want to take you
from that.

38:24.563 --> 38:29.524
And honestly, I really felt
like I could take on a
lightning storm all by myself.

38:29.568 --> 38:32.919
Yes. Magic Totems,
they are a bitch.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.619
You know how this morning
I said
that I was starting to define

38:37.663 --> 38:39.969
what I wanted
my life to look like?

38:40.013 --> 38:44.626
I meant as Guardian
and with you,
as partners on both fronts.

38:45.975 --> 38:48.151
Alex, I love you.

38:48.195 --> 38:49.718
You are a part of my life.

38:49.762 --> 38:52.939
And I am a part of yours,
and that is never gonna change.

38:55.202 --> 38:59.772
You are a part of my world
and a part of my team.

39:05.168 --> 39:06.169
I don't get it.

39:06.213 --> 39:08.650
I always try to be courageous.

39:08.694 --> 39:11.523
I don't understand why
I can't pass that trial.

39:11.566 --> 39:15.091
I don't get it, either. You've
sacrificed yourself for so many
people.

39:15.135 --> 39:17.920
You literally went to the
Phantom Zone to save humanity.

39:17.964 --> 39:23.012
And yet there was still
something I was doing wrong.

39:23.056 --> 39:28.017
Well, I may have a way to fight
Nyxly, without your needing to
pass the gauntlet.

39:28.322 --> 39:30.280
How?

39:30.324 --> 39:33.153
So, you know I went to
Newfoundland to learn more
about my mother.

39:33.196 --> 39:34.023
Yeah.

39:35.416 --> 39:41.596
Well, it's complicated,
but it turns out that...

39:41.640 --> 39:44.686
That she's a witch,
and apparently, so am I.

39:44.730 --> 39:45.557
What? That's...

39:48.429 --> 39:49.865
Seriously?

39:49.909 --> 39:52.041
Yeah. I mean, as you can
imagine, this is hard for me.

39:53.303 --> 39:56.394
I'm a scientist, but...

39:56.437 --> 39:59.005
And I'm not sure
I'm ready to talk about it yet.

39:59.048 --> 40:01.486
But there are things beyond
rational law.

40:01.529 --> 40:04.880
And apparently my bloodline
is one of them.

40:04.924 --> 40:07.927
Science might not be able
to defeat
what we're up against,

40:07.970 --> 40:10.233
but maybe a combination
of science and magic can.

40:10.277 --> 40:13.541
And I feel like I owe it to
everyone to learn as much
as I can.

40:13.585 --> 40:17.545
And I thought I could start
with seeing if I could untether
you from Nyxly.

40:19.199 --> 40:22.463
Well, I will take all of your
help with magic...

40:25.161 --> 40:26.815
but I want to stay connected to
her.

40:27.642 --> 40:30.384
It could be an asset.

40:30.428 --> 40:34.083
If I can sense how Nyxly's
feeling, maybe I can sense what
she's planning.

40:34.127 --> 40:36.869
I mean, it could be painful and
dangerous.

40:36.912 --> 40:40.176
Nyxly is unlike any villain
we've ever faced,

40:40.220 --> 40:44.137
and if it gives us
an advantage,
I'm willing to take that risk.

40:44.180 --> 40:48.794
I don't know what that gauntlet
was about, 'cause you are the
epitome of courageous.

40:52.624 --> 40:54.495
Kara! Kara, are you all right?
Is it happening again?

40:56.236 --> 40:59.805
She's angry. Nyxly's angry.

41:04.157 --> 41:06.115
Why does she not suffer?

41:06.159 --> 41:10.293
My gauntlet brought me
nothing but unfiltered pain.

41:10.337 --> 41:16.256
Supergirl went through the same
trials, and yet she's hopeful,
happy.

41:16.865 --> 41:18.780
Why?

41:18.824 --> 41:22.523
Perhaps you suffer most
because you passed your test.

41:23.350 --> 41:24.351
She didn't.

41:26.962 --> 41:27.789
You're right.

41:30.836 --> 41:31.837
I won.

41:35.362 --> 41:37.669
My pain is the price of the
power...

41:39.540 --> 41:45.459
and with it, I will find the
rest of the Totems.
