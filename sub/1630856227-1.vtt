WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:10.000
This programme contains some strong language and some violent scenes

00:11.520 --> 00:13.440
HE TURNS OFF TAP

00:16.000 --> 00:18.400
TAP DRIPS

00:22.640 --> 00:23.800
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

00:23.800 --> 00:25.160
DOOR CLOSES

00:25.160 --> 00:26.480
You need to pack a bag.

00:27.600 --> 00:31.360
Erm, just, uh, just some clothes, a washbag, a few books...

00:31.360 --> 00:34.360
Dad, what's going to happen? You've got one hour.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.920
I'm ready. OK, just give me a second. Wait here.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.880
Sir.

00:59.440 --> 01:03.000
You are a member of the British staff under my command!

01:03.000 --> 01:05.200
You've got to put a stop to this. The postmortem...

01:05.200 --> 01:07.200
This is not going to end well!

01:18.520 --> 01:20.000
Squadron Leader Russell.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.160
Wing Commander Chapman.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.400
Sorry to interrupt.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.560
How was Dubai, sir?

01:26.560 --> 01:29.240
Yeah, the meeting went well, yeah.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.760
I saw a friend when I was over there. A doctor.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.840
I've had some pain.

01:35.840 --> 01:38.880
Actually, I've had something bothering me for a while now.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.560
So I had it looked at.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.680
And now it's the next steps.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.480
Next steps to what?

01:46.480 --> 01:48.880
They found a mass on my liver.

01:48.880 --> 01:52.680
So I need to have it biopsied and then, if it goes the way they

01:52.680 --> 01:55.480
think it's going to, then I'd rather be at home in Scotland for that.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.520
You've got liver cancer?

01:59.680 --> 02:00.840
Suspected.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.320
There is one thing you can do. Anything.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.480
You can take command of the squadron.

02:08.480 --> 02:10.760
I'm going to recommend that to the Air Marshal.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.320
Thank you, sir.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.320
This isn't on the way to Auntie's.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.800
No, you're coming with me.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.160
What? To Scotland?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.440
I can't leave you here.

02:42.440 --> 02:43.960
Are we coming back?

02:45.800 --> 02:47.280
I don't know. Probably not.

02:49.120 --> 02:52.400
CAR HORN BLARES

02:53.840 --> 02:55.880
BLARING CONTINUES

02:57.640 --> 03:00.920
TRANSLATION:

03:23.160 --> 03:26.200
OVER RADIO: Bravo Operator, how long till you're in position?

03:26.200 --> 03:28.480
Closing in now, ma'am. Less than a minute.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.240
Move off!

03:47.720 --> 03:50.120
RADIO: Move into position. Roger, moving into position.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.920
Let's go. Close in.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.080
On my left, Simmonds.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.800
Come on, pick up the pace. Move!

04:01.480 --> 04:03.320
Quebec Charlie, this is Bravo Operator.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.560
We're in position. Over.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.720
This is Quebec Charlie.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.840
Bravo Operator, you are clear to tag targets. Over.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.240
I'm going to move to higher ground. I'll get a cleaner line.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.120
Do you want us to move with you? No need.

04:23.800 --> 04:24.920
DEVICE BEEPS

04:32.080 --> 04:34.240
Are we on closed loop now? We are.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.200
I'll be handing ops control to Dundair.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.080
Quebec Charlie, all targets selected. Over.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.560
Keep your heads down, Lawson.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.960
Switching channel control...now.

04:43.880 --> 04:46.760
Tango Charlie, this is Quebec Charlie. You have control.

04:46.760 --> 04:48.520
Roger, I have control.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.200
Here we go.

04:52.280 --> 04:54.640
Indeed. I'm going to go check on the pilots.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.120
Pilots, this is Air Vice-Marshal Grainger,

04:59.120 --> 05:01.840
I have control of the operation.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.800
All call signs, complete final checks.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.400
DOOR OPENS

05:06.400 --> 05:08.680
Yo! All set, Sam?

05:08.680 --> 05:10.800
There shouldn't be any lag this time.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.680
All looks good. OK, man.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.120
DOOR CLOSES

05:15.800 --> 05:17.400
Dixon, do you copy?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.480
Roger. This is Alpha Operator.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.400
Alpha R-PAS in position.

05:26.280 --> 05:29.440
Bravo Operator in formation now.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.640
Charlie R-PAS moving into Formation Three.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.720
Delta, following in formation.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.760
Stay low. Live fire incoming.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.880
Roger. R-PAS flying overhead.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.480
VL-1 operators, you may begin your attack.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.280
GUNFIRE

06:00.000 --> 06:01.440
Firing...now.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.120
Delta R-PAS commencing its run. Over.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.240
This is Alpha Operator. Firing rockets.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.920
Sir, trespasser on the beach perimeter.

06:37.120 --> 06:40.440
All operators, cease firing and stay in position.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.440
LIGHT HUMMING OVERHEAD

06:50.120 --> 06:52.680
Send a team to the perimeter. Yes, sir.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.560
Is there a problem? Not at all.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.040
It's probably wildlife.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.920
VEHICLE APPROACHES

07:27.920 --> 07:29.960
Are we done here? Waiting on orders.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.560
Weapons test complete,

07:37.560 --> 07:39.520
we'll move on to phase two.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.440
Navigation check shortly.

07:41.440 --> 07:44.440
No need, Marcus. I think we can wrap it up here.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.000
We've seen what they can do.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.200
His Highness will be very happy,

07:49.200 --> 07:51.520
they are exactly what our military needs.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.200
If you're sure?

07:53.200 --> 07:55.640
He might even increase the order.

07:55.640 --> 07:56.920
OK, then.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.600
Stage One complete.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.520
THEY GRUNT

08:03.520 --> 08:05.200
I'll tell you what this is, lads.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.840
It's our checkout girl moment.

08:06.840 --> 08:09.120
How's that? Cos one minute we're in the supermarket,

08:09.120 --> 08:11.640
scanning the bananas, next minute, we're out of a job.

08:11.640 --> 08:12.960
Long overdue!

08:12.960 --> 08:14.440
OTHERS LAUGH

08:17.400 --> 08:20.240
I think that was fairly comprehensive, wasn't it?

08:20.240 --> 08:23.000
And they don't even ask for a cup of tea when it's over.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.960
As you've seen, the system networks field operators with remote pilots.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.720
You can launch from the back of a van if needs be.

08:29.720 --> 08:33.160
And the next iteration will have full-spec targeting software

08:33.160 --> 08:35.080
as well as 3D situation rendering.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.120
I believe we're on course to deliver that in a month?

08:38.120 --> 08:40.360
Third quarter, subject to contract.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.440
Very good. Now for the fun part.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.440
The pilots will surrender control

08:45.440 --> 08:48.320
and let the autopilots return them to the launchpads.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.040
That's just one of several preprogrammed routines,

08:51.040 --> 08:52.640
aimed at conserving assets.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.760
The idea is, if a pilot's kit gets damaged,

08:55.760 --> 08:58.560
Lassie comes home all by herself.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.120
HE CHUCKLES

08:58.560 --> 09:01.120
Lassie?

09:01.120 --> 09:03.360
It's a famous dog.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.760
All operators, this is Tango Charlie.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.240
Release to autopilot,

09:07.240 --> 09:10.560
set to pad return in Formation Three. Confirm.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.440
Alpha R-PAS released to autopilot.

09:13.440 --> 09:16.160
Bravo R-PAS released to autopilot. Confirmed.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.480
Charlie R-PAS released to auto.

09:18.480 --> 09:19.800
Delta R-PAS released.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.800
And back they come.

09:25.720 --> 09:29.480
You can operate them from the field or from the other side of the world.

09:29.480 --> 09:33.200
They can fly a foot off the ground or at 5,000m.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.000
They are going to change the way we fight.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.040
We're all done here, ma'am.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.320
We've got to babysit them till they're safely down.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.280
DRONES HUM

09:46.520 --> 09:48.720
I don't know, man. I think they're fucking creepy.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.480
You'd be the expert, Patrick!

09:50.480 --> 09:52.240
OTHERS CHUCKLE

10:01.960 --> 10:04.080
Dixon, this is Grainger.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.120
What are you doing?

10:06.120 --> 10:08.080
Unexpected item in bagging area.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.200
Are you lost? Jog on, mate!

10:11.200 --> 10:12.840
GUNFIRE

10:14.000 --> 10:15.880
He's firing at us! Shit!

10:21.600 --> 10:23.560
Active fire! Take cover!

10:23.560 --> 10:26.600
This is Bravo Unit. Alpha R-PAS is firing on the ground team.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.960
Medic!

10:29.120 --> 10:30.680
Men down, medevac needed.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.480
Get security to the APC.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.480
Shut Dixon down. Do it now!

10:34.480 --> 10:37.160
I'm trying to get back on the system. Over.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.760
Simmonds, stay with us!

10:38.760 --> 10:40.200
GUNFIRE

10:49.400 --> 10:51.040
Mate, you all right?

10:51.040 --> 10:52.080
Medic!

10:53.160 --> 10:54.720
I need a medic now!

10:54.720 --> 10:56.840
Come on, mate, stay with me, come on!

10:58.560 --> 11:00.440
Medic! Eliza, what the hell?

11:00.440 --> 11:02.320
I'm trying to find out. It's Dixon's unit.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.280
We can see that! Someone's taken over Alpha R-PAS! Do you read me?

11:05.280 --> 11:06.960
Dixon, get control of Alpha now!!

11:06.960 --> 11:09.480
Dixon, come in. Kader, Barker, Lawson, does anyone read me?

11:09.480 --> 11:11.560
Come in, Dixon. Come on, you bastard!

11:11.560 --> 11:13.400
Disable your weapons, Dixon!

11:15.240 --> 11:16.680
Dixon, come in.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.240
Force Protection are on their way.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.040
Get out of the vehicle slowly, hands up.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.240
No, no, don't shoot! Open up!

11:24.240 --> 11:27.040
Don't fucking shoot! Come on out!

11:27.040 --> 11:30.040
It's OK, I didn't do anything. Open the door!

11:30.040 --> 11:32.200
Open up now! Dixon, open up!

11:32.200 --> 11:33.480
Open the door now!

11:35.960 --> 11:38.560
GUNFIRE

11:40.840 --> 11:43.440
GUNFIRE

11:46.280 --> 11:49.720
This is Bravo Operator. I've got control of Bravo unit.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.680
In pursuit of Alpha R-PAS.

12:00.240 --> 12:03.400
Gentlemen, everybody down to the ground floor. Quick as you can.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.920
Quick as you can.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.640
HE PANTS

12:10.040 --> 12:12.280
INDISTINCT COMMOTION

12:17.920 --> 12:20.160
Lawson, take Alpha drone out now!

12:20.160 --> 12:22.280
GUNFIRE

12:33.680 --> 12:36.280
This is Bravo Operator.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.960
Alpha has been destroyed.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.640
I'm taking Bravo back to pad now.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.160
I'm coming out.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.120
Wait! Wait! Easy! Easy! Easy!

12:45.280 --> 12:47.880
GRUNTING

12:47.880 --> 12:49.680
HE COUGHS

12:53.720 --> 12:55.120
Medic!

13:05.840 --> 13:07.360
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

13:16.280 --> 13:18.200
HE SOBS SOFTLY

13:24.680 --> 13:26.480
DISTANT SHOUTING

13:51.920 --> 13:55.560
MUSIC: Fuel To Fire by Agnes Obel

13:55.560 --> 13:59.040
# Do you want me on your mind

13:59.040 --> 14:03.560
# Or do you want me to go on

14:07.600 --> 14:12.600
# I might be yours, as sure as I can say

14:14.240 --> 14:17.880
# Be gone, be far away

14:21.080 --> 14:24.280
# Ooh

14:28.320 --> 14:32.600
# Ooh. #

14:42.280 --> 14:44.720
You know Billy gets two chocolate bars in his lunch?

14:44.720 --> 14:46.600
We're just out of the dentist... PHONE RINGS

14:46.600 --> 14:49.440
..and you're already talking about chocolate? Phone.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.760
It can wait.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.400
Please, tell me more about Billy's lunch.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.080
He gave me one of his chocolates for doing his homework yesterday.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.200
You're doing his homework for a chocolate bar?

14:58.200 --> 14:59.880
He does know that's fraud?

14:59.880 --> 15:02.720
Does he know your mother and her girlfriend are both police officers?

15:02.720 --> 15:05.440
Mum! You point him out later and I'll tell him myself.

15:05.440 --> 15:08.320
No! I'm joking! Give us a kiss.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.080
PHONE RINGS

15:12.080 --> 15:14.400
And stop doing homework for lazy-arse boys!

15:16.920 --> 15:17.960
DCI Silva.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.560
What are we looking at? Seven confirmed fatalities,

15:27.560 --> 15:29.760
three more in serious condition. They've got the man

15:29.760 --> 15:32.120
they think's responsible, they're holding him on site.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.360
What about the press?

15:33.360 --> 15:36.200
Total blackout due to national security, but that won't last.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.360
We follow the Air Force's lead on safety.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.440
Apart from that, we treat it like any other scene.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.000
Nothing gets moved, nobody leaves without our permission.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.480
Who's on-site? Local police are taking statements

15:45.480 --> 15:48.520
but I need you to take them again, in detail. Yes, ma'am.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.480
Apparently, the MOD asked for me.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.200
Well, either that's a vote of confidence or someone's

15:54.200 --> 15:55.680
got it in for the Air Force.

15:57.280 --> 15:58.400
But you're OK with it?

15:59.720 --> 16:00.760
OK with what?

16:02.440 --> 16:05.520
Oh, come on, I'm not an invalid yet! No. What? No!

16:05.520 --> 16:06.920
I'm not talking about the baby,

16:06.920 --> 16:09.440
I'm talking about us working together on the same case.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.880
It's just I'd prefer someone on it

16:10.880 --> 16:15.000
who's got experience with the military. OK.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.640
Well, it'll probably mean we'll have to stop holding hands

16:18.640 --> 16:23.600
once we get there, but I appreciate you raising it, ma'am.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.560
Get in! It's not too late to put you on maternity leave.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.120
Good morning, ma'am. Flying Officer Clothier.

17:15.120 --> 17:17.720
The Air Marshal asked me to escort you to the prisoner.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.960
Suspect. Whatever you prefer, ma'am.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.800
DI Longacre, DS Townsend.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.360
Can you speak to the other pilots? We need to get a full picture.

17:24.360 --> 17:27.400
OK. Co-ordinate with forensics, secure the scene.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.960
What about the surrounding roads?

17:28.960 --> 17:30.840
All sealed off and guards posted.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.120
No-one's been in or out.

17:32.120 --> 17:35.640
You can bring a car around here if you need to take him away.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.040
No, I'll talk to him first.

17:38.040 --> 17:40.760
Hello, I'm Detective Chief Inspector Amy Silva.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.320
Flying Officer Colin Dixon.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.320
Have you been assessed? What for?

17:47.320 --> 17:50.440
For your injuries. No, I'm fine. I just need to talk to you.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.800
I'm going to put these on you and I do have to caution you.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.520
You are not obliged to say anything,

17:56.520 --> 17:59.600
but anything you do say will be noted and may be used in evidence.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.480
Can you help him up?

18:01.480 --> 18:03.480
Come on. OK.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.760
Look, whatever you've done, you've still got the right

18:05.760 --> 18:08.560
to be treated appropriately. I haven't done anything.

18:09.640 --> 18:10.960
Taking him inside.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.160
How are you holding up?

18:23.920 --> 18:25.760
They were only here as props.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.200
Imagine being killed for that.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.360
They said you didn't want to come back to the mess.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.640
Yeah, I'll stay with Simmonds.

18:36.640 --> 18:39.120
Was he a friend? Yeah.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.680
Most of us were deployed together in Afghanistan.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.560
I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.

18:53.840 --> 18:57.080
Can you tell me who you were with during the weapons test?

18:57.080 --> 18:59.120
Five of the British Air Force Regiment.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.240
And you were here with them the whole time?

19:01.240 --> 19:02.560
Yeah, pretty much.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.760
Patrick stuck a dressing on Simmonds.

19:07.760 --> 19:08.960
Couldn't save him.

19:11.600 --> 19:15.960
Well, another witness told me that you moved to get a better sightline.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.880
Is that right? I moved from there to there.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.640
What are you implying?

19:22.640 --> 19:25.960
I can't see that would make much difference, would it?

19:25.960 --> 19:28.680
I wasn't hiding. It was a better position.

19:28.680 --> 19:31.360
Were you in the line of fire when the R-PAS started shooting?

19:31.360 --> 19:33.680
Are you asking me if I did this?

19:33.680 --> 19:35.200
I'm just gathering the facts.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.480
OK. I didn't do this.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.920
Well, your colleagues seem to think you did.

19:41.920 --> 19:45.200
Yeah, I know, because it was my R-PAS. I know how that looks.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.360
Erm, R-PAS?

19:46.360 --> 19:48.720
Remotely Piloted Air System.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.200
It's what civvies call drones.

19:51.200 --> 19:54.160
I wasn't operating it when it kicked off. I'd set it to autopilot.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.880
And at that point you couldn't be reached by comms? Look, I tried!

19:56.880 --> 19:59.240
I honestly did. I tried but the comms cut out

19:59.240 --> 20:00.400
when it got taken over.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.040
It's on the same system.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.680
There's meant to be a backup radio but I couldn't find it.

20:06.680 --> 20:09.840
So, you're on your own in the vehicle? Yes. The whole time.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.800
Doors are locked? Yes.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.760
But that was part of it.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.080
Operating in combat conditions.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.680
And what about when they tried to open it up?

20:18.680 --> 20:23.200
Well, I... I went to open the hatch, but then, er,

20:23.200 --> 20:24.720
bullets started hitting.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.760
Well, they were hitting the team that was sent to detain you.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.480
So, you say you're on autopilot.

20:31.480 --> 20:35.240
And presumably you can take back control at any time?

20:35.240 --> 20:37.800
Yeah, but so can anyone who's on the system.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.240
Once you log in on the main system,

20:42.240 --> 20:45.760
if a unit is on auto or standby, you can take control of it.

20:45.760 --> 20:48.800
All four units went to autopilot.

20:48.800 --> 20:52.120
So, anyone with a console could have taken over Alpha R-PAS.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.680
Well, apart from Lawson, who shot down the R-PAS.

20:57.480 --> 20:59.600
But the other two could have.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.160
I mean, think about it, if I wanted to do this,

21:03.160 --> 21:06.800
why would I take control of the R-PAS that I'd been flying?

21:06.800 --> 21:09.360
Is there any way that you can prove that you didn't take

21:09.360 --> 21:11.240
control back from the autopilot?

21:11.240 --> 21:13.040
Well, innocent until proven?

21:13.040 --> 21:15.240
Not that that stops anyone, does it?

21:17.240 --> 21:19.560
Look, I was in there alone.

21:20.960 --> 21:24.400
All I can say is that I did the sequence for the test

21:24.400 --> 21:26.240
and after they stopped the demo early,

21:26.240 --> 21:28.920
I went to auto, like I was ordered.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.880
After that, I never touched my controls again.

21:30.880 --> 21:33.320
Yeah, why did they stop it early? I don't know.

21:33.320 --> 21:36.360
I mean, we were meant to do another run and they just had us hover,

21:36.360 --> 21:38.360
said we were done and...

21:38.360 --> 21:40.520
Look, I've had a boot on my throat for over an hour

21:40.520 --> 21:42.480
and nobody's told me anything.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.520
And who were the other pilots?

21:44.520 --> 21:47.200
Other than you and Flight Lieutenant Lawson.

21:47.200 --> 21:51.240
Captain Sam Kader and Flight Lieutenant Callum Barker.

21:51.240 --> 21:55.640
But they're back in Al Shawka air base, in Wudyan.

21:55.640 --> 21:56.680
In the Middle East?

22:05.040 --> 22:06.320
Take a seat, Barker.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.160
There were multiple casualties.

22:18.640 --> 22:19.960
Several fatalities.

22:23.520 --> 22:26.680
Friends of ours from both sides of the partnership.

22:26.680 --> 22:29.840
In terms of people we've worked closely with, I'm...

22:29.840 --> 22:32.280
I'm sorry to have to tell you that Simmonds

22:32.280 --> 22:35.400
and Davidson both died on the range.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.440
Jansen was injured as well.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.040
He's in a critical condition.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.000
What about Dixon?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.960
What about him?

22:44.960 --> 22:47.480
I got a text about him.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.240
He's got to have surgery on a shattered cheekbone.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.520
I'm not across everything.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.720
He was sat operating inside an APC.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.560
Do you have something you want to say?

22:57.560 --> 22:59.920
He got the shit kicked out of him by our own people.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.280
So is that it, then? We're all suspects?

23:04.280 --> 23:07.480
Of course we are, this was our operation.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.280
So get a grip.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.880
There are going to be questions and there should be questions.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.400
You will answer them honestly and I'll do the same.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.000
That's how this gets resolved.

23:17.680 --> 23:21.040
Kader, you and Barker both need to write statements. Separate rooms.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.680
Why separate rooms?

23:22.680 --> 23:24.520
So you can't be accused of collusion.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.080
Do you have the names of the Wudyanis who were killed?

23:28.080 --> 23:29.840
Colonel Bilali has that information.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.960
It's for him to decide how to handle that. Fuck's sake.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.280
What?

23:34.280 --> 23:36.600
For fuck's sake! He's asking about his mates.

23:38.120 --> 23:40.520
You don't think I'm upset?

23:40.520 --> 23:42.240
Of course I am.

23:42.240 --> 23:45.480
But this is bigger than me and what we do next matters more

23:45.480 --> 23:46.880
than my feelings or yours.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.760
So pull yourself together, last warning.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.560
HE MURMURS

23:55.560 --> 23:59.080
Further treatment can wait, then we'll do it in Wudyan. OK.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.000
We all want to be home now.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.560
We'll arrange flights. We'll have you all back in Wudyan by morning.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.480
Have the police found out who did this?

24:06.480 --> 24:07.840
Nothing concrete.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.840
They'll get answers for us but they need time.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.960
What's clear to me is this was someone who wants

24:12.960 --> 24:15.520
to destroy our relationship.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.360
I've spoken to His Highness.

24:17.360 --> 24:21.640
He's minded to end the R-PAS programme and cut all funding.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.840
Ali, you can't. It is not just about today.

24:23.840 --> 24:28.240
The disrespect shown to him has been constant, for years now.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.880
Your MPs ignore our reforms.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.760
Instead, they talk to the newspapers about our human rights record.

24:33.760 --> 24:37.320
You're right, you're right. You are. Our politicians are hypocrites.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.760
But I do know they want this partnership to work.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.880
We'll make sure they get the message.

24:41.880 --> 24:45.400
Just, please, give us time to make things right.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.880
We send our soldiers to fight people who want to destroy you.

24:50.360 --> 24:53.880
In response, your courts threaten to ban British companies from selling

24:53.880 --> 24:58.600
weapons to us. Ali, you know how committed we are to our partnership.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.840
Please. You want half a billion dollars to fund the next phase

25:01.840 --> 25:03.720
of this project, yes?

25:03.720 --> 25:06.120
Money spent on a country who talks about His Highness

25:06.120 --> 25:07.640
like he's a war criminal.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.520
Frankly, you could not afford for this to happen.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.080
Yet here we are.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.080
Do you know why the demo was called off early?

25:23.080 --> 25:25.280
I think that was an operational matter.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.480
Well, I'm sure it was. I'm asking why it happened.

25:27.480 --> 25:30.000
I believe there was a security issue on the perimeter.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.040
Range security dealt with it and the feeling was we could wrap up.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.280
It happens a fair bit.

25:35.280 --> 25:38.120
People like to fly their toy drones into Air Force airspace.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.720
And security dealt with that?

25:39.720 --> 25:41.520
They went to look for the trespasser,

25:41.520 --> 25:43.200
I don't believe anyone was found.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.280
You didn't think to tell us about that?

25:45.280 --> 25:47.240
It's not my decision, ma'am.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.160
As I say, it's not uncommon.

25:49.160 --> 25:50.960
I'd like to see the Air Vice-Marshal now.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.600
I'll check if he's available. I can do that.

26:12.760 --> 26:16.120
DCI Silva? I'm Air Vice-Marshal Marcus Grainger.

26:16.120 --> 26:19.960
This is Derek McCabe from Alban-X, the people who made the R-PAS.

26:19.960 --> 26:21.640
You want flight data, right?

26:21.640 --> 26:24.160
So, this needs to go back to the factory.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.120
That's how you'll find out what's gone on here,

26:26.120 --> 26:27.560
not pissing about taking photos.

26:27.560 --> 26:30.320
Derek wants to remove the flight recorder from the damaged unit.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.760
I think the unspent munitions need to be dealt with first.

26:32.760 --> 26:36.840
If you try moving it and it goes off, you lose all the onboard data.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.640
I assume you have an operating system to co-ordinate the units?

26:39.640 --> 26:42.760
We do, we're analysing that data right now. Where?

26:42.760 --> 26:44.640
Headquarters. Outside Glasgow.

26:44.640 --> 26:47.400
OK, well, I need to send a team in. We're going to need all that data.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.000
We've nothing to hide.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.520
What this is, this is somebody firing a gun.

26:51.520 --> 26:54.280
We manufacture the gun, we didn't pull the trigger.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.480
The law's very clear on liability.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.200
PHONE RINGS

26:58.200 --> 26:59.360
Excuse me.

26:59.360 --> 27:00.520
How are you getting on?

27:02.560 --> 27:04.640
OK. I've just finished up with Lawson.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.480
Well, Lawson shot the R-PAS down, so...

27:09.280 --> 27:10.360
Amy?

27:10.360 --> 27:12.080
PHONE BEEPS

27:12.080 --> 27:13.120
Amy?

27:14.520 --> 27:15.560
AMY?!

27:20.880 --> 27:22.920
Air Marshal Grainger, are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.560
DCI Silva? Fine, I'm fine.

27:26.200 --> 27:27.600
Are you all right?

27:27.600 --> 27:28.920
Yeah.

27:28.920 --> 27:30.840
Your phone, ma'am.

27:30.840 --> 27:34.160
Shit. It isn't safe. I need to...to clear this site.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.560
You've got your culprit.

27:35.560 --> 27:38.080
I don't have a culprit, Dixon is a suspect.

27:38.080 --> 27:40.800
And so are the other two pilots in Wudyan, so no-one goes anywhere

27:40.800 --> 27:42.640
until they've spoken to one of my officers.

27:42.640 --> 27:45.480
It isn't my pilots in Wudyan, I'd trust them with my life.

27:45.480 --> 27:48.360
So if it isn't one of ours, the system must have been hacked.

27:48.360 --> 27:50.360
Oh, Marcus, come on. This is a closed system,

27:50.360 --> 27:53.360
you know it's unhackable. It was your people flying them today.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.960
Don't try and off-load this on me. I now have seven people dead.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.760
Seven families that I need to speak to!

27:58.760 --> 28:01.240
Oh, my God! Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.760
Cos, Amy, I saw the explosion and then your phone...

28:03.760 --> 28:06.320
It just got knocked out of my hand, but it's OK. Sir!

28:08.000 --> 28:11.240
Is everything all right, Sir? Yes.

28:11.240 --> 28:14.000
The video link's ready for you now, Sir. Who are you talking to?

28:14.000 --> 28:15.680
My team in Wudyan. I'll come with you.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.440
Anything you want moved off the base, you're going to need

28:19.440 --> 28:22.360
my written permission. I'm not naive about the job you've got here,

28:22.360 --> 28:24.400
but there's still a schedule for testing.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.640
We've a multibillion pound contract on the line.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.200
Both of us are on the hook for that.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.200
I'm afraid seven dead people trumps your share price.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.960
Make sure nothing gets moved.

28:32.960 --> 28:35.960
There was a trespasser on the perimeter during the test. OK.

28:35.960 --> 28:38.960
If there's any chance they're still out there, we need to find them.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.120
Let's go.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.640
Usually, Derek and I get along but the bodies are still warm

28:48.640 --> 28:51.520
and he's practically demanding an indemnity.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.400
I didn't know we had a base in Wudyan.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.000
We're not involved in the war there, are we?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.960
It isn't a war.

28:58.960 --> 29:01.320
Wudyan is supporting a legitimate neighbouring

29:01.320 --> 29:02.760
government against insurgents.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.600
We provide them with operational support.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.200
Strictly non-combatant status.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.880
You're not the first to get it wrong, the reporting

29:08.880 --> 29:10.400
has been very one-sided.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.040
Right. They jail journalists, though, don't they?

29:14.320 --> 29:17.520
Britain is relatively unusual in not jailing its journalists.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.920
Wudyan is one of our most important partnerships.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.240
It's going to be bloody challenging riding this out.

29:23.240 --> 29:25.880
Two of them killed on our range... COMPUTER BEEPS

29:25.880 --> 29:29.080
I have DCI Amy Silva with me.

29:29.080 --> 29:31.240
DCI Silva, Eliza Russell,

29:31.240 --> 29:33.880
Acting Commanding Officer for 109 Squadron

29:33.880 --> 29:36.280
while Wing Commander Chapman is on medical leave.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.640
How are you, Eliza?

29:37.640 --> 29:40.160
Everyone's in shock here. We just want answers.

29:40.160 --> 29:43.280
My team's asking for information about the casualties.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.560
Two Wudyani technicians, two Protection Force,

29:45.560 --> 29:46.880
and a few others badly injured.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.680
We'll have to see if they pull through.

29:48.680 --> 29:51.840
And you know about Simmonds and Davidson.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.720
Do you want me to speak to the families?

29:53.720 --> 29:56.800
I'll handle that. Simmonds's wife is having a baby.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.240
Let's answer the DCI's questions.

30:01.240 --> 30:04.000
This is full disclosure? Nothing's under Official Secrets?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.080
Full transparency.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.160
KNOCKING

30:06.080 --> 30:08.160
I'm in a meeting.

30:08.160 --> 30:10.280
I don't think this can wait at all.

30:10.280 --> 30:11.920
I'm on a call with the Air Marshall

30:11.920 --> 30:15.760
and a Detective Chief Inspector from the Scottish Police Force.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.920
Wes is in charge of the development programme

30:17.920 --> 30:20.040
for R-PAS for Alban-X.

30:20.040 --> 30:23.600
Er, I'm not in charge. Technical lead.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.560
I just finished running the logs in the warehouse.

30:26.560 --> 30:29.000
If there's any equipment there that could be used to operate

30:29.000 --> 30:31.240
the drones, that needs to be sealed off straight away.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.040
No access, no exceptions.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.360
Er, I don't think we can do that. We'll do that.

30:36.440 --> 30:38.520
Are all the controllers accounted for?

30:38.520 --> 30:41.120
Yes. Two in Scotland, three here.

30:41.120 --> 30:44.280
I put the ones that we used away already. So, yeah, it's all there.

30:44.280 --> 30:45.760
What was it you were going to say?

30:45.760 --> 30:50.800
Uh, so Colin Dixon flew Alpha R-PAS

30:50.800 --> 30:54.880
until he passed it to autopilot and all four pilots went to auto.

30:54.880 --> 30:58.840
The next pilot to take control of Alpha R-PAS

30:58.840 --> 31:01.800
was Wing Commander Anthony Chapman.

31:05.360 --> 31:09.080
Er, it's all there in the data.

31:09.080 --> 31:11.160
Login confirmed.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.160
He took control of Alpha R-PAS and flew it

31:13.160 --> 31:14.880
until Bravo R-PAS shot it down.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.840
Bravo R-PAS was Lawson.

31:18.080 --> 31:22.480
She got back on the system 30 seconds after he got on.

31:22.480 --> 31:25.360
The console camera was on, but he must have covered it.

31:25.360 --> 31:27.480
And where is Anthony Chapman now?

31:27.480 --> 31:30.920
He flew back here with his daughter two days ago.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.720
He's having cancer treatment.

31:32.720 --> 31:35.080
He's due to have an operation today.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.320
Are you sure he flew back?

31:36.320 --> 31:38.760
Well, I spoke to him as soon as he got in. He came and saw me.

31:38.760 --> 31:42.520
Clearly, the system has been compromised in some way.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.280
We checked the logs in Glasgow. It's going to say the same thing.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.200
For Christ's sake, the man's probably on a morphine drip!

31:50.680 --> 31:52.240
Should we end the call there?

31:58.880 --> 32:00.080
It's all there in the data.

32:00.080 --> 32:02.920
You might want to check with your employer before you share that.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.720
I'm not going to sit on something like that. I'm not saying that.

32:05.720 --> 32:09.720
I'm just saying, as a friend, make sure you're protected.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.920
Alban-X is going to get sued left, right and centre.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.520
Don't get caught in the middle.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.440
Where were you when the test went wrong?

32:19.440 --> 32:22.640
Er, are you joking?

32:22.640 --> 32:24.440
I have to do this with everyone.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.800
Don't take it personally. And you're here now.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.320
I was in the armoury.

32:30.320 --> 32:31.800
Any witnesses?

32:31.800 --> 32:33.880
Well, I actually like to call them co-workers.

32:33.880 --> 32:35.640
Don't be a dick about this.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.760
Yes. There will be people who saw me there.

32:39.520 --> 32:43.960
By the way, I don't report to you. So if you keep on talking

32:43.960 --> 32:47.560
to me that way, you can shove your questions right up there.

32:47.560 --> 32:48.840
How's that for an answer?

32:50.240 --> 32:53.080
Sorry, just to clarify, where exactly do you want me

32:53.080 --> 32:54.240
to shove my questions?

33:05.000 --> 33:08.080
The hospital confirmed he's got a procedure at 4pm.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.600
He hasn't turned up yet.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.520
His address was given as the Avondale Hotel.

33:12.520 --> 33:14.840
Can you send a team? Chapman could be armed.

33:25.240 --> 33:27.880
The last known location for the trespasser was down at the beach.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.960
Security said they've kept eyes on the road and posted lookouts.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.480
Nobody's been seen. If they've hidden themselves,

33:33.480 --> 33:35.520
they would have moved north, along the coast.

33:35.520 --> 33:36.800
Could have a boat stashed?

33:36.800 --> 33:39.080
Aye, well, coastguard's keeping an eye out.

33:40.120 --> 33:42.120
This will find them quicker than we can.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.920
DRONE WHIRS

33:58.000 --> 33:59.760
Room key?

33:59.760 --> 34:00.800
Let's go.

34:24.840 --> 34:27.320
Armed police! Armed police, stay where you are!

34:27.320 --> 34:29.160
Clear! Room clear.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.040
That's him. That's Anthony Chapman.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.280
Can you make me a copy of that? Yeah, no problem.

34:50.360 --> 34:52.440
He's heading off the path.

34:52.440 --> 34:55.080
He's heard the rotors, hasn't he? He's trying to get under cover.

34:55.080 --> 34:58.480
No, move on, don't stop. We don't want him to think that we found him.

34:59.880 --> 35:03.040
We'll bring the drone back when we're closing in on him, OK?

35:03.040 --> 35:05.360
Right, grab me two armed officers.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.080
You have charge of the scene here.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.480
We're approaching last-known location.

35:13.480 --> 35:15.840
He's moving now. He's climbing a tree. Can you see him?

35:15.840 --> 35:17.560
Aye, I can.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.720
Police! Stay where you are!

35:19.720 --> 35:21.120
Aye, we've got him now.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.320
Do not move!

35:23.320 --> 35:25.840
Is he armed? Er, no weapon visible.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.720
He's got a rucksack.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.000
He's taking his phone out.

35:30.240 --> 35:31.840
Police.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.960
Yeah? Yeah, I can see that.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.200
Don't shoot. Drop your phone down to me.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.720
I'm not doing that. It's expensive.

35:37.720 --> 35:41.240
I need you to drop your bag and your phone to me.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.120
Then you're going to climb down.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.720
At no point put your hands inside your pockets or anywhere where

35:45.720 --> 35:47.200
I can't see them, do you understand?

35:47.200 --> 35:48.920
It's not illegal to sit in a tree.

35:48.920 --> 35:51.040
We'll talk about that when you're on the ground.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.600
I hear Nicole's flying back in tonight?

35:54.600 --> 35:57.320
That's right. Not Dixon, he's in surgery.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.520
As you know.

36:00.760 --> 36:03.400
And we're restarting missions again tomorrow? Yes.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.280
We're under orders.

36:05.280 --> 36:07.040
Unless you're unable to do the job?

36:08.160 --> 36:09.640
I'm good.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.680
Have you calmed down?

36:11.680 --> 36:12.720
Yes, ma'am.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.000
Your report's very thorough. Thank you.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.880
I gave it my best.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.600
Resubmit it. Take this part out.

36:22.040 --> 36:25.360
Can I ask why? Your opinion on past operations are not relevant.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.120
Yes, ma'am.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.720
I need to speak to you about Wing Commander Chapman.

36:34.960 --> 36:40.720
One person reported hearing a heated exchange between him

36:40.720 --> 36:42.120
and someone in the rec room.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.640
Do you know anything about that?

36:46.720 --> 36:48.320
No-one mentioned that to me.

36:49.880 --> 36:51.600
Did he tell you where he was going?

36:52.600 --> 36:53.720
No, ma'am.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.160
OK. We're finished here.

37:00.360 --> 37:01.400
Off you trot.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.600
You OK?

37:12.600 --> 37:14.720
Two more years to serve and I'm done.

37:17.440 --> 37:20.160
What did she say to you? Nothing.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.960
That's the point, though, isn't it? Business as usual.

37:24.280 --> 37:26.600
You need to keep your head down. Yeah.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.280
We had it coming though, didn't we?

37:31.280 --> 37:32.520
That's the truth.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.160
Firas Zaman. Alan's got the details.

37:48.160 --> 37:51.200
I'm going to take him through. No solicitor requested.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.160
You can change your mind at any point, you know?

37:53.160 --> 37:55.000
No point wasting their time as well.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.840
Why were you at the Dundair air weapons range today?

38:21.840 --> 38:23.120
Birdwatching.

38:23.120 --> 38:25.840
Which species did you see? Oh, no, I'm not any kind of expert.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.680
I just...I like watching them in general.

38:28.680 --> 38:32.320
And you use a drone for that? What, binoculars not your style?

38:32.320 --> 38:35.400
There are public rights of way. I did nothing wrong walking there.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.480
If I missed a sign, I apologise.

38:37.480 --> 38:40.560
There were a lot of signs. Then I'll apologise several times.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.160
When the Air Force sent out a patrol,

38:44.160 --> 38:45.840
you took action to evade them.

38:45.840 --> 38:47.520
I continued my walk as planned.

38:49.280 --> 38:50.920
Why were you filming a weapons test?

38:50.920 --> 38:52.840
That was fascinating.

38:52.840 --> 38:54.880
My little drone only takes pictures.

38:54.880 --> 38:58.800
Theirs, I'm sure they'll kill a lot of people with that.

38:58.800 --> 38:59.840
Very impressive.

39:01.280 --> 39:03.520
You disapprove of what they're doing there?

39:05.400 --> 39:07.640
You're a Detective Inspector.

39:07.640 --> 39:10.400
Seems like a very senior rank to cover minor trespassing.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.360
True, true.

39:13.640 --> 39:15.640
So why do you think I'm talking to you?

39:17.040 --> 39:18.560
Do you think it's unreasonable

39:18.560 --> 39:21.320
we'd want to talk to someone caught filming mass murder?

39:21.320 --> 39:23.880
As in weapons capable of...?

39:23.880 --> 39:25.880
Seven people were killed there today.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.560
I'm sorry.

39:29.560 --> 39:30.680
I had no idea.

39:33.360 --> 39:36.120
Do you have any contacts in the Air Force? Or in Wudyan?

39:36.120 --> 39:37.640
I'm from Wudyan.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.720
And you're a resident here now? I am, yeah.

39:40.720 --> 39:43.560
Do you know a man named Anthony Chapman?

39:43.560 --> 39:46.240
I'm not good with names.

39:46.240 --> 39:48.160
Why did you erase your phone?

39:48.160 --> 39:50.200
It was necessary to protect my privacy.

39:52.840 --> 39:57.320
Officers searched your flat under warrant and came across these.

39:57.320 --> 40:00.600
Now, these are prescriptions for medicines,

40:00.600 --> 40:03.920
written by Doctor Mohammed Rajab, in Bahrat Wud.

40:05.360 --> 40:08.320
That's not too far from the Al Shawka airbase.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.360
Is it?

40:11.720 --> 40:13.640
What are all these doing in your flat?

40:13.640 --> 40:15.360
They're for my various ailments.

40:16.360 --> 40:18.480
And you've got a few ailments, don't you?

40:18.480 --> 40:21.760
I mean, what am I looking at? Diabetes medication,

40:21.760 --> 40:23.360
an Asthma inhaler.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.840
Stimulants for ADHD.

40:24.840 --> 40:29.160
I mean, this is what, 15, 16 different conditions?

40:29.160 --> 40:30.600
Yeah, and this one...

40:31.840 --> 40:32.880
Meriofert.

40:34.360 --> 40:38.240
How did your IVF go? Was it your first pregnancy?

40:38.240 --> 40:39.600
I have no further comment.

40:42.680 --> 40:45.240
I imagine these are all being used as some sort of code?

40:45.240 --> 40:46.600
Is that about right?

40:46.600 --> 40:47.760
I'd like to go home now.

40:49.160 --> 40:51.600
Firas Zaman, I have reason to believe you may have been

40:51.600 --> 40:53.080
involved in an act of terrorism.

40:54.720 --> 40:57.840
I'm ordering that you be detained under the Protection of Freedom Act.

40:57.840 --> 41:01.440
For how many days? You can be held without charge for up to 14.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.560
Your right to legal advice is unaffected.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.480
I'm on the side of the angels.

41:08.360 --> 41:09.400
Believe me.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.760
I'm going to read you your rights.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.880
And then I think you should talk to me.

41:17.960 --> 41:19.960
When did Chapman request medical leave?

41:19.960 --> 41:21.560
The first day he flew back.

41:21.560 --> 41:25.680
He asked me for six months to cover surgery and chemo.

41:25.680 --> 41:27.400
I didn't question it.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.040
Does he even have cancer?

41:29.040 --> 41:31.960
That looks unlikely. He didn't show for his hospital appointment

41:31.960 --> 41:35.000
and he left the hotel five minutes after he arrived there yesterday.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.120
There's no sign that he's been back there since.

41:37.120 --> 41:41.000
Both his phone and his daughter Sabiha's phone are switched off.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.240
Do you know of anywhere that he might have gone?

41:43.240 --> 41:45.640
No. Anthony always rented places short-term.

41:45.640 --> 41:48.400
His daughter's at a school outside Edinburgh.

41:48.400 --> 41:51.600
His wife died when she was quite young.

41:51.600 --> 41:54.480
She was Wudyani. He ended up speaking the language,

41:54.480 --> 41:56.840
made him a shoe-in for the role.

41:56.840 --> 41:59.040
We've tried Sabiha's school.

41:59.040 --> 42:02.840
We're just trying to get in contact with some of her friends now.

42:02.840 --> 42:05.400
Did you know her? I've known her since she was a baby.

42:06.640 --> 42:09.320
Sorry, I appreciate this must be difficult for you.

42:09.320 --> 42:11.200
My feelings are irrelevant.

42:14.160 --> 42:17.600
Would Chapman have known that, once he logged into the R-PAS,

42:17.600 --> 42:20.720
then his login details would have been recorded? Yes.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.600
He's been our lead on the VL-1 programme,

42:22.600 --> 42:24.360
he commands the joint squadron out there,

42:24.360 --> 42:25.800
he'd have known he'd be caught.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.400
What is it exactly that the Air Force are doing in Wudyan?

42:28.400 --> 42:31.280
The Wudyani and British Air Force set up a joint R-PAS squadron

42:31.280 --> 42:34.280
a couple of years ago. It's part of a wider deal with the country.

42:34.280 --> 42:37.560
The supply of British-made weaponry, tech, training and development.

42:37.560 --> 42:40.800
So, you're supporting Wudyan's conflict with their neighbours?

42:40.800 --> 42:42.680
No, that's not how we'd put it.

42:42.680 --> 42:44.800
We supply expert operational support.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.200
It helps sustain our strategic position in the region,

42:47.200 --> 42:48.880
that's really the most important thing.

42:48.880 --> 42:50.840
I mean, partnerships like this are the future.

42:50.840 --> 42:54.240
And these drones that you were testing, are they...? R-PAS.

42:54.240 --> 42:56.880
They're never drones. That's what you fly down the park.

42:56.880 --> 42:59.000
R-PAS. Are they part of that future?

42:59.000 --> 43:00.200
Absolutely.

43:00.200 --> 43:03.000
Alban-X supplies the units, the Air Force services them and

43:03.000 --> 43:05.800
trains their pilots. It's a whole ecosystem.

43:05.800 --> 43:09.080
We get favourable terms for our own purchase of the system.

43:09.080 --> 43:12.400
It'll create 600 highly skilled jobs in Scotland.

43:12.400 --> 43:13.840
The list goes on.

43:13.840 --> 43:16.480
So our government wants this to happen? Very much.

43:16.480 --> 43:19.280
The Wudyanis are spending real money now,

43:19.280 --> 43:21.960
investing in our long-term presence.

43:21.960 --> 43:23.760
What happened today threatens that.

43:23.760 --> 43:27.240
So, we have a senior Air Force officer trying to disrupt

43:27.240 --> 43:29.720
a key alliance? That's exactly what he's done.

43:29.720 --> 43:32.880
Have there ever been any questions about Chapman's loyalties?

43:34.520 --> 43:36.920
There have been leaks coming out of the base.

43:36.920 --> 43:40.280
Details about the joint squadron's work in Wudyan were

43:40.280 --> 43:42.440
passed on to a UK journalist.

43:42.440 --> 43:45.600
Is that journalist's name Firas Zaman?

43:45.600 --> 43:47.640
Yes. We've got him in custody.

43:47.640 --> 43:50.000
He was the man caught trespassing on the range.

43:51.960 --> 43:54.600
Firas... Hello, everyone. I'm Ramsay.

43:54.600 --> 43:56.400
The guys upstairs told me to sit this one in.

43:56.400 --> 43:58.120
Hope that's good with you.

43:58.120 --> 44:00.480
DI Longacre, right? Right.

44:00.480 --> 44:02.400
And you're from? London.

44:03.800 --> 44:07.400
So, where did we get to, Mr Zaman?

44:07.400 --> 44:10.240
Mr Zaman is a Wudyani national

44:10.240 --> 44:12.480
and a very keen birdwatcher.

44:12.480 --> 44:17.240
Says you left Wudyan 15 years ago and claimed asylum here.

44:17.240 --> 44:19.040
A known associate of Mohammed Rajab,

44:19.040 --> 44:21.880
who is currently in prison in Wudyan on terrorism charges.

44:21.880 --> 44:23.760
Mm. We were just talking about him.

44:25.720 --> 44:28.600
The birdwatching's news to me, though.

44:28.600 --> 44:32.080
Mohammed Rajab is a human rights activist.

44:32.080 --> 44:35.560
He was sent to prison because he petitioned for a free press. Mm.

44:35.560 --> 44:38.440
He's also suspected to be part of a terrorist organisation

44:38.440 --> 44:41.240
called Jabhat Al'huriya. They're not a terrorist organisation.

44:41.240 --> 44:43.160
Let's not get lost in the whole terrorist

44:43.160 --> 44:44.880
versus freedom fighter debate.

44:44.880 --> 44:47.440
According to the Wudyani Government, you're a terrorist,

44:47.440 --> 44:48.920
if you believe in democracy.

44:48.920 --> 44:52.000
Jabhat Al'huriya wouldn't be the first allegedly peaceful group

44:52.000 --> 44:53.640
to start killing people.

44:53.640 --> 44:55.160
What else have you got?

44:55.160 --> 44:56.840
I've read the preliminary report.

44:56.840 --> 44:59.760
It seems that someone logging into the R-PAS control system

44:59.760 --> 45:03.240
would need to know exactly when the autopilot was engaged.

45:03.240 --> 45:06.080
Ideally, what you need is someone observing the test.

45:07.440 --> 45:10.200
Someone who can make a quick phone-call. Ah.

45:10.200 --> 45:12.040
Well, Mr Zaman wiped his phone.

45:15.640 --> 45:16.920
And why would you do that?

45:18.360 --> 45:20.760
I wasn't sure which service you were from,

45:20.760 --> 45:25.120
but the whole smug schoolboy shit really gives it away.

45:25.120 --> 45:26.160
MI5, right?

45:27.760 --> 45:30.280
Have you discussed Anthony Chapman? We have.

45:30.280 --> 45:32.040
And Mr Zaman doesn't know him.

45:33.920 --> 45:36.000
You're looking at 14 days, you know that?

45:37.200 --> 45:40.160
TRANSLATION:

45:42.120 --> 45:47.240
I did more than 100 days in Wudyan, with electric shocks

45:47.240 --> 45:50.760
and waterboarding, sometimes beatings,

45:50.760 --> 45:53.840
sometimes all of those in the same day.

45:53.840 --> 45:56.120
I was in the right then.

45:56.120 --> 45:58.320
And I am right now.

45:58.320 --> 46:00.080
Right about what, though?

46:00.080 --> 46:02.400
Whether or not you saw a chaffinch?

46:05.440 --> 46:07.040
Right, I'll pop you an email

46:07.040 --> 46:09.480
with the rest of what we've got on this guy.

46:09.480 --> 46:11.360
Lovely to meet you.

46:11.360 --> 46:12.400
And you.

46:17.560 --> 46:22.160
Between you and me, I think I got the better deal here.

46:22.160 --> 46:27.040
How's that? I mean, I just have to lie down in a cell for two weeks.

46:27.040 --> 46:29.400
You're going to have to work with him.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.640
No, I don't think so.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.640
If MI5 want to run things, they will.

46:32.640 --> 46:34.360
So why don't you help me out, then?

46:36.120 --> 46:37.400
Why were you there today?

46:40.120 --> 46:42.280
The weapons they're developing,

46:42.280 --> 46:44.680
the drones that were tested today? Hm?

46:44.680 --> 46:48.200
They won't just be used in Wudyan's proxy war with our neighbours.

46:48.200 --> 46:52.120
Before long, they'll be used on the local population.

46:52.120 --> 46:54.400
Peak oil is coming.

46:54.400 --> 46:58.080
When the money stops, this is how the regime clings to power.

46:58.080 --> 47:00.760
This is the change they're preparing for.

47:00.760 --> 47:03.560
Those drones are tools for repression.

47:05.400 --> 47:06.680
I was told about the test.

47:08.200 --> 47:09.720
I went to record it.

47:09.720 --> 47:11.320
Who told you about the test?

47:12.840 --> 47:15.360
Somebody brave. I can say that.

47:16.640 --> 47:18.000
I won't say anything else.

47:20.960 --> 47:23.520
I'm going to need to formally interview the pilots.

47:23.520 --> 47:27.200
Could you arrange for Nicole Lawson to come in tomorrow?

47:27.200 --> 47:29.600
Er, she's been flown back to Wudyan.

47:29.600 --> 47:32.440
I expressly asked that all of your personnel be

47:32.440 --> 47:33.760
available for interview.

47:33.760 --> 47:36.920
Well, we assumed that changed with Chapman. It didn't.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.480
The joint squadron are wanted operationally.

47:39.480 --> 47:41.440
Colonel Bilali wanted to fly his people back,

47:41.440 --> 47:43.000
so we took care of that.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.880
I thought it was the least that we could do.

47:44.880 --> 47:47.880
And it didn't occur to you to discuss that with me?

47:47.880 --> 47:49.240
We're discussing it now.

47:51.200 --> 47:53.400
PHONE BUZZES

47:51.200 --> 47:53.400
Excuse me.

47:54.720 --> 47:57.160
DS Townsend would like a word. He's on his mobile.

48:04.240 --> 48:05.560
She's spicy.

48:05.560 --> 48:08.600
You'd do well to treat DCI Silva with respect.

48:09.760 --> 48:12.240
Not on principle, out of self-interest.

48:15.320 --> 48:17.200
DCI Silva. What have you got?

48:18.480 --> 48:21.080
Number one, they really hate us being here.

48:21.080 --> 48:22.920
Yeah, well, don't let them give you any shit

48:22.920 --> 48:24.560
about needing specialist software.

48:24.560 --> 48:26.680
You just get all the raw data.

48:26.680 --> 48:28.320
It's an arms company.

48:28.320 --> 48:30.520
They've got table-tennis in their reception.

48:30.520 --> 48:31.720
Of course they have.

48:32.920 --> 48:35.600
So, what have you found? I've run through all the video evidence

48:35.600 --> 48:37.680
from Dundair. There's no footage of the attack.

48:37.680 --> 48:39.800
It cuts out when the R-PAS went to autopilot.

48:39.800 --> 48:43.480
But we did get the GPS data, the satellite relay stuff.

48:43.480 --> 48:46.040
It gives us the location of where each console was used.

48:46.040 --> 48:47.120
And?

48:47.120 --> 48:50.120
Two GPS matches for the range at Dundair, two matches in Wudyan,

48:50.120 --> 48:51.600
where their squadron is based.

48:51.600 --> 48:54.280
And a fifth one, for the R-PAS Chapman got onto.

48:54.280 --> 48:56.680
GPS for that one is a little village in the Trossachs,

48:56.680 --> 48:58.520
an hour from Glasgow.

48:58.520 --> 49:01.560
Great. Send me the details, I'll head straight there.

49:01.560 --> 49:02.640
Good work.

49:06.280 --> 49:07.720
Kirsten, we need to go.

49:20.840 --> 49:23.600
I can tell you're pissed off, you're taking it out on the corners.

49:23.600 --> 49:26.680
Oh, shut up. I'm a good driver. I'm not disputing that.

49:29.240 --> 49:30.880
So? What?

49:30.880 --> 49:32.520
It's just us now.

49:32.520 --> 49:33.560
What's wrong?

49:35.880 --> 49:37.600
OK, I think you're doing too much.

49:38.960 --> 49:41.920
I'm not due for another two months and you put me on this case.

49:41.920 --> 49:45.000
I know! That's why I'm pissed off. It's not your fault.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.800
Oh, right.

49:46.800 --> 49:49.880
So you're having an argument with yourself? Well, let me know

49:49.880 --> 49:51.280
if I can help with anything.

49:52.880 --> 49:55.720
Poppy's staying at Louise's. I said if we were back before midnight,

49:55.720 --> 49:57.400
we'd pick her up.

49:57.400 --> 49:59.200
That's a good pivot.

49:59.200 --> 50:00.680
It was totally seamless.

50:24.040 --> 50:26.400
Can you at least stay in the car till it's clear?

50:34.800 --> 50:38.240
Ma'am, this is as close as we can get without the cars being heard.

50:38.240 --> 50:39.680
We'll hike up from here.

50:39.680 --> 50:41.480
Are your team ready to go? Yes, ma'am.

50:41.480 --> 50:43.800
OK. We'll follow on behind.

50:43.800 --> 50:45.000
Keep it muted, please.

51:20.520 --> 51:21.800
Armed police!

51:26.920 --> 51:28.280
Kitchen clear!

51:29.480 --> 51:32.200
Clear. Bathroom clear.

51:32.200 --> 51:34.600
Clear. All clear, all clear.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.320
Check the perimeter.

52:02.320 --> 52:05.280
Looks like Chapman was here with his daughter. Yes, ma'am.

52:12.240 --> 52:13.480
Amy.

52:20.800 --> 52:23.360
I'll call this in, get forensics up here.

52:32.680 --> 52:34.880
Hi. Yes, we have a deceased male.

52:34.880 --> 52:36.880
Likely ID, Anthony Chapman.

52:36.880 --> 52:38.720
Apparent gunshot wound to the head.

52:40.440 --> 52:42.840
I'll send you my location.

52:42.840 --> 52:43.880
Thank you.

52:45.320 --> 52:47.240
OK, they're going to be half an hour.

52:47.240 --> 52:49.000
Shot from that direction, face on.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.400
Maybe he saw something, heard something, and turned?

52:53.480 --> 52:54.920
The bullet's in deep.

52:56.320 --> 52:59.600
Maybe a high-power hunting rifle? A lot of those around here.

52:59.600 --> 53:00.800
Deer stalking.

53:00.800 --> 53:02.440
Ma'am. Yep?

53:02.440 --> 53:05.000
The area's all secured. There's fresh tyre tracks in the mud.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.960
A vehicle's turned around and gone. We're photographing for treads.

53:07.960 --> 53:09.400
Any signs of Sabiha Chapman?

53:09.400 --> 53:11.720
No, ma'am. Well, she either ran or they took her.

53:11.720 --> 53:14.680
Can you let control know we need to get a full search under way?

53:14.680 --> 53:17.440
You should start the search. Yes, ma'am. Anything else?

53:17.440 --> 53:18.680
No, ma'am. We've got it.

53:20.320 --> 53:21.800
Should get back to the car.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.000
Wait for forensics, try and get some rest.

53:25.800 --> 53:27.520
OK. Sure.

53:27.520 --> 53:28.640
If you're tired.

53:33.240 --> 53:35.360
The question is, who knew he was staying there? Mm.

53:35.360 --> 53:38.600
If he was hiding out, that's got to be a short list.

53:38.600 --> 53:41.080
Why log in with his own name? Hm.

53:41.080 --> 53:43.320
Why broadcast his location over GPS?

53:43.320 --> 53:44.760
Cos he wanted to be found.

53:44.760 --> 53:46.480
Who knew he was back?

53:44.760 --> 53:46.480
DISTANT SHOUT

53:46.480 --> 53:47.520
Uh...

53:49.440 --> 53:50.560
What?

53:52.600 --> 53:54.200
I thought I heard something.

53:55.240 --> 53:58.680
What did you hear? I'm not sure.

53:58.680 --> 53:59.920
Help!

53:59.920 --> 54:03.200
Compton, we need urgent assistance. We might have found Sabiha Chapman.
