00:20.188 --> 00:22.147
[man whistles]

00:22.148 --> 00:24.024
Hey, Frank! Let's
wrap it up and go home.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.359
What do you say?

00:25.360 --> 00:27.444
Well, I got another
hour's work to do.

00:27.445 --> 00:30.030
The kid's gonna stick with me,
and then I'll show him the ropes.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.949
Okay. You lock up for
me before you go?

00:31.950 --> 00:34.410
4th of July weekend, buddy boy.
Got to move.

00:34.411 --> 00:36.578
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Well, you have a nice 4th,

00:36.579 --> 00:38.747
and I'll see you Sunday
at the barbecue.

00:38.748 --> 00:41.500
You'd better believe it.
I'll be there with bells on.

00:41.501 --> 00:44.670
Kid, I wanna tell you something,
and I mean this sincerely.

00:44.671 --> 00:47.798
No matter what happens,
don't name it after me.

00:47.799 --> 00:49.259
[laughs]

00:49.884 --> 00:51.594
Take it easy, Frank.

00:52.804 --> 00:54.638
That Burt's a joker.

00:54.639 --> 00:56.557
OK, Freddy, follow me
and learn something.

00:56.558 --> 00:58.225
Okay.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.769
We got an order here from the St.
Louis University Medical School.

01:00.770 --> 01:03.939
They want two adult female
skeletons with perfect teeth.

01:03.940 --> 01:06.734
That's a 2-AF-PT.

01:06.735 --> 01:08.736
OK? So you come over
here to the "A" section.

01:08.737 --> 01:10.904
- That's "A" for adult, see?
- Okay.

01:10.905 --> 01:13.198
Then that's divided up
into two sections.

01:13.199 --> 01:15.951
That's divided into the "M"
for male and the "F" for...

01:15.952 --> 01:17.870
- Female.
- Good boy.

01:17.871 --> 01:19.538
Now the "PT."

01:19.539 --> 01:22.374
Suppose you think that's
"pretty tough", but no, that's...

01:22.375 --> 01:25.210
- Perfect teeth.
- Very good.

01:25.211 --> 01:28.005
Now you get some excelsior over
there and lay it in that crate.

01:28.006 --> 01:31.134
Make a nice little beddy-bye
for this little lady.

01:32.052 --> 01:33.136
Okay.

01:34.345 --> 01:36.555
Good work. We want
her to be comfortable.

01:36.556 --> 01:38.682
Now help me get her in.
Grab her legs.

01:38.683 --> 01:40.225
Okay.

01:40.226 --> 01:43.562
Now you get some of
that styrofoam popcorn,

01:43.563 --> 01:45.898
spread it all around.

01:45.899 --> 01:49.109
Don't be stingy.
Uncle Burt's paying for this.

01:49.110 --> 01:52.029
More, Freddy, more.
OK, that's fine.

01:52.030 --> 01:54.865
Now spread it around.
That's right.

01:54.866 --> 01:57.534
- You're doing very nice work.
- Thanks.

01:57.535 --> 01:59.578
You're gonna be fine in the
warehouse business.

01:59.579 --> 02:01.371
Where do we get all
these skeletons from?

02:01.372 --> 02:03.916
- Oh, they come from India.
- India?

02:03.917 --> 02:06.835
International treaty.
All skeletons come from India.

02:06.836 --> 02:08.252
No kidding. How come?

02:08.253 --> 02:09.880
How the hell do I know "how come"?

02:09.881 --> 02:11.799
The important question is,

02:11.800 --> 02:14.134
where do they get all the
skeletons with perfect teeth?

02:14.135 --> 02:16.136
I'm going to ask you a
serious question.

02:16.137 --> 02:18.305
How many people you know die

02:18.306 --> 02:21.767
with a beautiful, perfect set
of choppers in their puss, huh?

02:21.768 --> 02:23.435
Nobody I can think of.

02:23.436 --> 02:26.772
No. I think that there's a
skeleton farm over in India.

02:26.773 --> 02:28.982
[laughs]
Jesus!

02:28.983 --> 02:32.277
Come on, kid.
Follow your uncle here.

02:32.278 --> 02:33.904
Here we go.

02:33.905 --> 02:35.864
I don't have to tell
you what these are for.

02:35.865 --> 02:37.283
Ba ba ba boom!

02:38.159 --> 02:41.453
Here we've got the prosthetic
devices, all around here.

02:41.454 --> 02:43.664
Look under there. Wheelchairs.

02:43.665 --> 02:45.582
Right. These are great.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.084
Here's something you
don't see very often.

02:47.085 --> 02:49.128
You're a privileged person.

02:49.129 --> 02:52.756
These are split dogs.
Yep, for veterinarian schools.

02:52.757 --> 02:54.675
Oh, we get a lot of
orders for split dogs.

02:54.676 --> 02:55.843
- That's really rad.
- Yeah.

02:55.844 --> 02:58.887
[growls]
Don't fool around, you're learning.

02:58.888 --> 03:02.891
Over here, Freddy, is where
we keep the fresh cadavers.

03:02.892 --> 03:04.810
We sell these to medical schools

03:04.811 --> 03:07.397
and to the U.S. Army
for ballistic tests.

03:13.736 --> 03:15.280
Well, say hello.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.623
We usually got
more inventory than this,

03:26.624 --> 03:29.544
but, ah, we're expecting
a shipment on Monday.

03:31.504 --> 03:34.089
H-how many bodies are in here usually?

03:34.090 --> 03:36.258
Well, you know, you don't
want to be overstocked.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.177
Kind of like the restaurant business,

03:38.178 --> 03:41.598
you don't want your inventory
to lose its freshness.

03:42.682 --> 03:44.641
[laughs]

03:44.642 --> 03:46.268
Tell you what I'll do, kid.

03:46.269 --> 03:48.479
Teach you how to fill
out these shipping forms.

03:50.607 --> 03:52.108
Look alive.

03:56.654 --> 03:59.990
- We gonna party tonight or what?
- Yeah, we are gonna party.

03:59.991 --> 04:01.450
Well, where?
Where we gonna party?

04:01.451 --> 04:04.161
- I don't know. Somewhere.
- Hey, we could go to the park.

04:04.162 --> 04:07.247
Oh, no, we can't. The cops will
shoot us if we go back to the park.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.874
And I ain't in no mood to die tonight.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.417
I like death.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.252
I like death with sex.
How 'bout you, Casey?

04:12.253 --> 04:14.546
- You like sex with death?
- Yeah, so fuck off and die.

04:14.547 --> 04:16.130
So, when we gonna
party tonight, Tina?

04:16.132 --> 04:17.257
Oh you guys,
that'd be really rad,

04:17.257 --> 04:19.134
but I'm supposed to meet Freddy
when he gets off work.

04:19.135 --> 04:20.844
Yeah, where you
supposed to meet him?

04:20.845 --> 04:22.512
At this medical supply warehouse
where he's working.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.848
Oh, no, he got a job?
What a dick.

04:24.849 --> 04:26.558
Shit, why didn't you say so?

04:26.559 --> 04:28.644
Why don't we all go pick Freddy up?

04:28.645 --> 04:30.772
Freddy always knows where
there's a place to party.

04:40.531 --> 04:41.990
Frank?

04:41.991 --> 04:44.117
Yeah, kid?

04:44.118 --> 04:47.454
What's the weirdest thing
you ever saw in here?

04:47.455 --> 04:48.997
Oh, kid,

04:48.998 --> 04:51.375
I have seen weird things come,

04:51.376 --> 04:54.169
and I have seen weird things go.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.421
But the weirdest thing I ever saw

04:56.422 --> 04:58.590
just had to cap it all.

04:58.591 --> 05:01.260
Oh, yeah? What's that?

05:01.261 --> 05:03.263
Let me ask you a question, kid.

05:04.722 --> 05:09.059
Did you see that movie,
Night of the Living Dead?

05:09.060 --> 05:11.019
Yeah, yeah, that's the
one where the corpses

05:11.020 --> 05:12.312
start eating the people, right?

05:12.313 --> 05:14.564
Sure. Wh-what about it?

05:14.565 --> 05:18.151
Did you know that movie
was based on a true case?

05:18.152 --> 05:20.696
Come on, you're shitting me, right?

05:20.697 --> 05:23.241
I've never been more serious in my life.

05:24.534 --> 05:25.659
That's not possible.

05:25.660 --> 05:28.495
I mean, they showed
zombies taking over the world.

05:28.496 --> 05:32.541
They changed it all around.
What really happened was

05:32.542 --> 05:36.628
back in 1969, in Pittsburgh,
at the V.A. hospital,

05:36.629 --> 05:38.797
there was a chemical spill

05:38.798 --> 05:41.216
and all that stuff

05:41.217 --> 05:44.052
kinda leaked down into the morgue

05:44.053 --> 05:46.305
and it made all the dead bodies

05:46.306 --> 05:48.473
kinda jump around as
though it was alive.

05:48.474 --> 05:50.017
What chemical?

05:50.018 --> 05:52.978
2-4-5-Trioxin,
it's called.

05:52.979 --> 05:56.356
It was to kinda spray on
marijuana or something.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.483
And the Darrow Chemical Company

05:58.484 --> 06:00.652
was trying to develop it
for the Army.

06:00.653 --> 06:04.239
And they told the guy who
made the movie

06:04.240 --> 06:08.327
that if he told the true story,
they'd just sue his ass off.

06:08.328 --> 06:11.663
So he changed all the
facts around.

06:11.664 --> 06:13.999
So what really happened?

06:14.000 --> 06:17.127
Well, they closed it all down, see,

06:17.128 --> 06:20.839
and the Army shipped all
that contaminated dirt

06:20.840 --> 06:23.925
and all those dead bodies out.

06:23.926 --> 06:26.763
And they kept it a secret. Shh.

06:27.764 --> 06:29.097
What...

06:29.098 --> 06:31.683
So how come you know about it?

06:31.684 --> 06:34.811
A typical Army fuck up.

06:34.812 --> 06:38.566
The Transportation Department
got the orders crossed,

06:39.817 --> 06:43.320
and they shipped those bodies here

06:43.321 --> 06:46.282
instead of to the
Darrow Chemical Company.

06:47.116 --> 06:49.410
[telephone rings]

06:51.746 --> 06:52.914
Hello?

06:53.748 --> 06:55.082
Oh, hi, honey.

06:55.083 --> 06:57.125
Uh, no, I'll be home in
about an hour.

06:57.126 --> 06:59.504
You keep the, uh,
pot roast hot, okay?

07:00.838 --> 07:04.592
Yeah, sure, I love you,
too, honey. Yeah. Kiss, kiss.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.599
Wanna see them?

07:13.559 --> 07:16.312
- See them?
- The corpses.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.440
What are you talking about?

07:20.441 --> 07:23.444
- They're down in the basement.
- No.

07:24.362 --> 07:26.822
- Come on.
- No way.

07:26.823 --> 07:28.491
[door creaks]

07:32.703 --> 07:35.747
Hey, mind the third step.
It's a bitch.

07:35.748 --> 07:37.833
You mean, they just brought
those bodies here and left them?

07:37.834 --> 07:39.543
Well, you know the Army.

07:39.544 --> 07:41.337
And they've been here
all this time?

07:41.921 --> 07:44.382
14 years, as I recall.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.301
No kidding?

07:49.637 --> 07:51.055
There they are.

07:52.223 --> 07:53.975
There's bodies in there?

08:01.023 --> 08:03.609
[squeaking]

08:12.535 --> 08:15.579
Oh, shit. Look at that.

08:15.580 --> 08:18.708
- You say that thing was alive?
- So they say.

08:24.881 --> 08:26.299
Oh, God.

08:27.383 --> 08:29.676
- Hey, these things don't leak, do they?
- Leak? Hell, no.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.972
These things were made by the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

08:33.890 --> 08:36.726
Oh, fuck!
[coughs]

08:41.606 --> 08:43.316

[soft classical music plays]

11:17.720 --> 11:20.096
Hello, dear. How was your day?

11:20.097 --> 11:21.598
The usual, crap.

11:21.599 --> 11:23.350
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:23.351 --> 11:24.726
What's for dinner?

11:24.727 --> 11:26.853
Your favorite, lamb chops.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.564
I had them for lunch.

11:49.585 --> 11:52.712
Yes, it's me, checking in
from Station 3 at 1600--

11:52.713 --> 11:55.048
uh, make that 1601 hours.

11:55.049 --> 11:57.176
I'll be home all evening. Right.

12:02.473 --> 12:04.600
[ Phone dialing ]

12:11.190 --> 12:14.943
It's nerve-racking to live around
that equipment all the time.

12:14.944 --> 12:18.238
They have to be able to reach
me 24 hours a day, wherever I am.

12:18.239 --> 12:19.322
You know that.

12:19.323 --> 12:21.658
All that microwave
stuff affects my oven.

12:21.659 --> 12:24.035
When we find them, you can
have the equipment taken out.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.787
But when will you find them?

12:25.788 --> 12:27.915
Christ, Ethel, I don't know!

12:29.333 --> 12:31.210
Maybe we'll never find them.

12:35.965 --> 12:38.007
Look, we've been
through all this before.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.802
They could be anywhere.

12:40.845 --> 12:43.305
[hard rock music plays]

12:46.475 --> 12:47.976
Where the fuck we going, anyway?

12:47.977 --> 12:50.478
- To party!
- To pick up Freddy.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.188
Oh, yeah, what the fuck is
Freddy up to these days, anyway?

12:52.189 --> 12:54.607
- He got himself a job.
- Oh, no shit? What job?

12:54.608 --> 12:57.318
- He's a stockroom clerk.
- Yeah? That sounds like a shitty job.

12:57.319 --> 12:59.028
Well, it isn't the President
of the United States,

12:59.029 --> 13:00.864
but at least he makes
money to buy stuff.

13:00.865 --> 13:02.782
Oh, yeah, maybe he'll
buy something from me?

13:02.783 --> 13:04.909
He don't like your
kind of stuff, Suicide.

13:04.910 --> 13:07.662

when you need a ride someplace?

motherfucker, Suicide.

[all yelling]

13:24.346 --> 13:26.848
Man, what a hideous, ugly place.

13:26.849 --> 13:30.268
- I like it. It's a statement.
- Come on, let's go get the prick.

13:30.269 --> 13:32.395
- No.
- Why not?

13:32.396 --> 13:35.231
- You might freak out his boss.
- Well, that's not nice.

13:35.232 --> 13:38.067
Yeah, what does he think
we are, weird or something?

13:38.068 --> 13:40.403
- What time does Freddy get off?
- 10:00.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.238
I ain't sittin' here two
fuckin' hours.

You wanna buy some gas, idiot?

13:46.327 --> 13:47.702
I was kidding.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.773
No, I just want to look
around the graveyard.

I ain't never seen one before.

14:18.609 --> 14:20.276
Ain't you never been to a funeral?

14:20.277 --> 14:21.861
I never knew nobody that died.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.780
I don't think
this is such a good idea.

- What's that?

happened to the body?

better tell Burt about this.

It makes us look stupid
or something.

16:26.362 --> 16:28.321
I can still smell that stuff.

16:28.322 --> 16:30.740
It must either be in my nose,
either that or it's all over everything.

No, you don't want to
call the cops.

to this company?

18:28.859 --> 18:31.027
What about the number
on the side of the tank?

18:31.028 --> 18:33.613
The one that said to,
"Call in case of an emergency."

18:33.614 --> 18:35.198
No, that's the Army.

Army around this place.

19:08.732 --> 19:10.525
Never.

Do you ever wonder

19:12.277 --> 19:15.738
about all the different ways of dying,

19:15.739 --> 19:17.990
you know, violently

19:17.991 --> 19:19.617
and wonder, like,

19:19.618 --> 19:23.287
what would be the most
horrible way to die?

I try not to think about
dying too much.

Mmm.

Well, for me

19:30.754 --> 19:32.464
the worst way

19:33.382 --> 19:36.717
would be for a bunch of old men

19:36.718 --> 19:38.554
to get around me

19:39.221 --> 19:41.472
and start biting

19:41.473 --> 19:43.933

the brain to kill them.

- The brain, right. Yeah.

to crack skulls with?

Maybe you can't kill it.
Maybe it won't die.

24:36.226 --> 24:38.102
Then we just got to
destroy it completely

dissolve a body?

24:43.358 --> 24:44.942
Sulfuric acid, maybe.

No, no, aqua regia,
that's stronger.

24:48.238 --> 24:50.823

everything, like the bones?

he gonna do for us?

25:14.473 --> 25:16.224

25:19.060 --> 25:21.395
Ernie's got a crematorium
across the street, Frank.

25:21.396 --> 25:24.106
A crematorium, that's beautiful.

25:24.107 --> 25:26.358
You think you can get
him to go along with it?

25:26.359 --> 25:28.486
I don't know. I've known
Ernie about 25 years.

25:28.487 --> 25:30.446
He might do it out of
friendship. I'm not sure.

25:30.447 --> 25:32.740
Yeah, but what the hell
are you gonna tell him?

25:32.741 --> 25:35.367

is the heart.

- Right up the chimney.

saved our ass, buddy boy,

me a second to rest,

you, but I'm really sick.

Why? What's wrong, Fred?

40:17.792 --> 40:19.667
I feel like hell is what's wrong.

40:19.668 --> 40:22.296
- I'm really sick.
- I'm sick, too, Burt.

going to bust wide open.

01:06:57.098 --> 01:06:59.432
Uh, yeah, well, uh, the chapel.

01:06:59.433 --> 01:07:02.185
All right, help me with Frank, please.

01:07:02.186 --> 01:07:04.105
- Lift his feet.
- Come on.

01:07:04.605 --> 01:07:06.190

01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:20.705
On the rug.

01:07:22.915 --> 01:07:25.376
Lay them on the carpet, gently.

01:07:26.377 --> 01:07:27.877
Easy.

01:07:27.878 --> 01:07:31.297
Easy, Frank. It's all right.
Can you hear me, Frank?

01:07:31.298 --> 01:07:33.550
Oh, boy, he's gone.

01:07:33.551 --> 01:07:34.802
[Tina sobs]

01:07:35.678 --> 01:07:38.179
Oh, Freddy.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:40.348
Look, let's just leave
them and get out.

01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:42.308
I'm not leaving Freddy.

01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:44.061
We got to lock the door,
you know that?

01:07:45.187 --> 01:07:46.564
I'm staying.

01:07:48.357 --> 01:07:50.567
Okay. Come on.

01:07:50.568 --> 01:07:51.819
Come on, Ernie.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.706
Dispatch, dispatch. This is bravo 751.

01:08:04.707 --> 01:08:06.458
We're at the mortuary.

01:08:06.459 --> 01:08:08.543
We see two, that is two,

01:08:08.544 --> 01:08:11.588
paramedic vehicles parked
in the rear parking lot.

01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:14.090
The doors on one
vehicle are hanging open.

01:08:14.091 --> 01:08:16.343
Stand by while we investigate.
Over.

01:08:18.804 --> 01:08:20.389
[muffled radio chatter]

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:28.606
[cocks gun]

01:08:40.785 --> 01:08:42.536
I got a man down.

01:08:46.999 --> 01:08:48.542
Ah, Jesus!

01:08:51.921 --> 01:08:53.837
Hold it right there!

01:08:53.839 --> 01:08:56.008
Freeze or I'll blow
your fucking brains out!

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.053
[screams]

01:09:00.638 --> 01:09:02.971
This place...

01:09:02.973 --> 01:09:06.769
Everybody that comes in
gets swallowed up.

01:09:07.937 --> 01:09:10.229
Send more cops.

01:09:10.231 --> 01:09:12.398
Well, what are we gonna do?
Stand here, beating our meat till

01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:14.399
the corpses bust in this damn place?

01:09:14.401 --> 01:09:16.528
There ain't no way to stop those things.
We gotta get the fuck out.

01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:17.694
We got to get to the cars.

01:09:17.696 --> 01:09:19.154
There's corpses all over the cars.

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:21.991
- I know that.
- What are you proposing?

01:09:21.992 --> 01:09:25.120
What am I proposing? I think we
all should do some damn proposing.

01:09:25.121 --> 01:09:26.537
The crawlspace in the ceiling.

01:09:26.538 --> 01:09:28.665
We could go up,
barricade ourselves in.

01:09:28.666 --> 01:09:31.376
The only way up is the hatch,
and we could nail that shut.

01:09:31.377 --> 01:09:32.877
You must be out of your fuckin' mind.

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:35.004
I'm not barricading
myself in no damn roof.

01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:37.256
Shit, I'd rather take
my chances with the cars.

01:09:37.258 --> 01:09:38.841
We need a way to fight them.

01:09:38.843 --> 01:09:40.969
How about this?

01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:42.345
What is that?

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:45.223
It's nitric acid.
Pretty much destroy anything.

01:09:45.224 --> 01:09:47.685
Yeah, but there's not--
not enough of it, Ernie.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:50.938
[screams]

01:09:52.314 --> 01:09:53.941

01:09:57.528 --> 01:09:59.155
It hurts!

01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:02.866
It hurts more than
you can imagine.

01:10:02.867 --> 01:10:04.201
I know.

01:10:08.205 --> 01:10:09.665
Freddy!

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:14.920
[sobs]

01:10:20.676 --> 01:10:22.511
I can finally see

01:10:23.304 --> 01:10:24.763
the one thing

01:10:25.973 --> 01:10:28.975
the one thing that can relieve
this horrible suffering.

01:10:28.976 --> 01:10:31.060
What, Freddy? What?

01:10:31.061 --> 01:10:33.146
Live brains!

01:10:33.147 --> 01:10:34.648

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:09.140
Let's go.

01:11:12.728 --> 01:11:14.104

01:11:18.317 --> 01:11:19.776
Get the girl!

01:11:19.777 --> 01:11:20.694
[screams]

01:11:22.404 --> 01:11:23.989
Run!

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.868
Put her on the couch.

01:11:29.078 --> 01:11:31.163
They got Freddy.

01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:35.291
It was horrible, ugly, man.

01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:37.335
His face was all fucked up.

01:11:37.336 --> 01:11:38.504
His face--

01:11:40.631 --> 01:11:41.923
He's not Freddy.

01:11:41.924 --> 01:11:44.218
Brains. Brains. Brains.

01:11:45.928 --> 01:11:48.555
Make her shut up. Make her shut up!

01:11:49.265 --> 01:11:50.473
[crash]

01:11:50.474 --> 01:11:52.141
Brains.

01:11:52.142 --> 01:11:54.353
Brains. Brains. Brains.

01:12:01.402 --> 01:12:02.736
Shit, he's trying to get out.

01:12:03.737 --> 01:12:05.155
Get a bench, come on.

01:12:08.993 --> 01:12:10.326
Ernie!

01:12:10.327 --> 01:12:11.870
Ernie, out of the way!

01:12:15.666 --> 01:12:18.043
Bring it against it. It's all right.

01:12:20.337 --> 01:12:21.587
I can't.

01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:23.506
Yes, you can. Get up!

01:12:23.507 --> 01:12:26.134
We can't stay here, man. It's
gonna bust through that door.

01:12:26.135 --> 01:12:27.970
We got to run for the cars.

01:12:28.887 --> 01:12:30.930
There's zombies all
over the cars outside.

01:12:30.931 --> 01:12:33.975
Got to fight our way through
them, there's no other way.

01:12:33.976 --> 01:12:37.228
Once we're in the car and moving,
I think we'll be all right.

01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:40.023
That's a big fucking "if," man.

01:12:40.024 --> 01:12:43.609
I can't walk, much less run.

01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:45.362
How bad is your foot, Ernie?

01:12:46.196 --> 01:12:47.865
Broke.

01:12:51.577 --> 01:12:52.661

01:12:55.581 --> 01:12:56.498
[screams]

01:12:58.292 --> 01:13:01.252
Spider and I'll get one of the cars,
we'll bring it up near the door.

01:13:01.253 --> 01:13:03.380
Police car. It should still
have the keys in the ignition.

01:13:05.007 --> 01:13:07.050
Son of a bitch.
The motor is still running.

01:13:07.051 --> 01:13:08.426
Good. I'll drive.

01:13:08.427 --> 01:13:11.262
- No, I'll drive.
- Hey, fuck you.

01:13:11.263 --> 01:13:14.265
When we drive up, I don't want to
hang out there longer than necessary.

01:13:14.266 --> 01:13:17.101
Young lady, you stand right here.
Put one hand here, one hand here.

01:13:17.102 --> 01:13:19.228
When I say "now,"
you open that door fast.

01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:22.106
The minute we're through, you
slam that door hard and lock it.

01:13:22.107 --> 01:13:23.316
Ernie,

01:13:23.317 --> 01:13:25.903
get your ass over here at the door.

01:13:32.201 --> 01:13:34.285
Burt...

01:13:34.286 --> 01:13:38.123
That favor that you owe me.
Watch your ass out there.

01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:43.545
All right, you stand by.

01:13:48.175 --> 01:13:49.343
Now!

01:13:56.058 --> 01:13:57.810
Run! Run!

01:13:59.561 --> 01:14:00.687
Get 'em!

01:14:02.648 --> 01:14:03.774
[honks horn]

01:14:15.828 --> 01:14:18.287
You got to get closer, man.
They'll never make it like this.

01:14:18.288 --> 01:14:19.705
We got to split. We got to split.

01:14:19.706 --> 01:14:21.125
No, we can't split.

01:14:26.505 --> 01:14:28.297
[screams]

01:14:28.298 --> 01:14:30.299
They left us, those jerks!

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:31.717
They left us!

01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:33.053
They had to.

01:14:34.513 --> 01:14:36.181
Burt will send help.

01:14:36.932 --> 01:14:38.891
I know him.

01:14:38.892 --> 01:14:40.269
They left us.

01:14:41.812 --> 01:14:43.688
What are you doing?
We can't just leave 'em!

01:14:43.689 --> 01:14:45.440
They'd have turned the
goddamn car over.

01:14:45.441 --> 01:14:46.607
We'll send help.

01:14:46.608 --> 01:14:48.568
Bullshit! Those are my fucking friends.

01:14:48.569 --> 01:14:50.153
I said we'll send help, man.

01:14:50.154 --> 01:14:52.156
- Coward!
- Fuck you!

01:14:54.992 --> 01:14:56.326
Hang on, here we go!

01:14:58.245 --> 01:14:59.996
What the fuck are we
gonna do now?

01:14:59.997 --> 01:15:01.581
Find a phone, call the cops.

01:15:01.582 --> 01:15:03.040
What the fuck?

01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:04.209

Hey, hey! Where is everybody?

01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:34.030
I don't know.

01:15:34.031 --> 01:15:36.116
- Who's he?
- He owns this place.

01:15:37.034 --> 01:15:38.784
That fucking car is totaled, man.

01:15:38.785 --> 01:15:41.329
That's all right. My car is
still out there. So is Frank's.

01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:42.581

Attention. Attention. This is the police.

01:17:45.495 --> 01:17:48.122
This area is under police blockade.

01:17:48.123 --> 01:17:50.041
All persons within this area

01:17:50.042 --> 01:17:51.792
wishing to surrender
should make their way

01:17:51.793 --> 01:17:53.879

It sounds like the shit's
really hitting the fan out there.

01:17:59.092 --> 01:18:00.593
Man, we got to let
them know we're in here.

01:18:00.594 --> 01:18:02.011
You better believe it.

01:18:02.012 --> 01:18:03.388
Hey, mister!

01:18:04.723 --> 01:18:06.265
Don't go in there.

01:18:06.266 --> 01:18:08.685
There's a thing in there,
and it ripped out the phone.

01:18:09.686 --> 01:18:11.354
There's another phone in the basement.

01:18:11.355 --> 01:18:13.773
The basement's fucked!
You know what's in the basement?

01:18:13.774 --> 01:18:16.025
- What do you mean?
- One of those corpses, man.

01:18:16.026 --> 01:18:18.944
A real ugly one, all black and slimy.

01:18:18.945 --> 01:18:22.198
I don't give a shit what's in the
basement, we got to get to that phone.

01:18:22.199 --> 01:18:24.617

work okay, doesn't it?

I'm going to knock
his goddamn block off.

01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:38.172
Tina, it was wrong for
you to lock me up.

01:18:38.173 --> 01:18:40.841
I had to hurt myself to get out.

01:18:40.842 --> 01:18:43.552
But I forgive you, darling.

01:18:43.553 --> 01:18:45.888
And I know you're here,

01:18:45.889 --> 01:18:48.683

01:19:07.661 --> 01:19:10.621
And now you made me
hurt myself again.

01:19:10.622 --> 01:19:14.084
You made me break my hand
completely off this time, Tina.

01:19:15.752 --> 01:19:18.421
But I don't care, darling,

01:19:18.422 --> 01:19:21.006
because I love you.

01:19:21.007 --> 01:19:25.470

01:19:52.122 --> 01:19:56.042
All right, you guys, go.
Get in there, come on, fast. Get in!

01:20:00.964 --> 01:20:02.799

That's our friend.
The Tarman got him.

01:20:25.822 --> 01:20:28.199
Yeah. Give me the police.

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.659
It's an emergency, operator.

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.411
Captain, over here.

01:20:32.412 --> 01:20:33.955
Two more cars around the side.

01:20:36.917 --> 01:20:38.209
Yes, go ahead.

01:20:38.210 --> 01:20:40.044
Yeah, you've got to help us.

01:20:40.045 --> 01:20:42.588
There's a bunch of us trapped inside
your barricade, and we can't get out.

01:20:42.589 --> 01:20:45.216
First of all, mister, what the
hell is going on in there?

01:20:45.217 --> 01:20:48.385
I lost a dozen good men,
and nobody can tell me jack shit.

01:20:48.386 --> 01:20:50.095
There are people in the cemetery

01:20:50.096 --> 01:20:51.555
who are stark, staring mad.

01:20:51.556 --> 01:20:53.182
They'll kill you and eat you.

01:20:53.183 --> 01:20:55.851
It's like a disease, like
rabies, only faster. A lot faster.

01:20:55.852 --> 01:20:57.686
That's why you got
to come in here now

01:20:57.687 --> 01:20:59.855
and get us the
hell out of here. Please!

01:20:59.856 --> 01:21:03.108
Just a minute, I can't hear you.
There's a lot of noise out here.

01:21:03.109 --> 01:21:05.486
Hey, what the hell's going on?

Cops. They've got the cops.

01:21:34.933 --> 01:21:36.976
That means they're breaking
out of the barricade.

<i>Your name, please?</i>

01:22:04.337 --> 01:22:05.462
Burt Wilson.

You're being transferred.</i>

01:22:21.646 --> 01:22:22.856
Yes?

01:22:23.982 --> 01:22:25.358
Yes, Captain.

01:22:26.776 --> 01:22:29.528
- I see. Very well.
- Horace.

01:22:29.529 --> 01:22:32.197
- Put the call through to me.
- What is it?

01:22:32.198 --> 01:22:34.409
Yes, yes, put him on.

01:22:36.036 --> 01:22:38.830
Mr. Wilson, where are
you calling from?

01:22:40.498 --> 01:22:43.251
I see. When did this take place?

01:22:44.336 --> 01:22:46.546
And when was the tank first breached?

01:22:47.839 --> 01:22:49.758
Why didn't you call
this number immediately?

01:22:51.217 --> 01:22:54.387
I see. It's understandable.
Wh-what happened next?

01:22:55.472 --> 01:22:56.848
Uh-huh.

01:22:57.641 --> 01:23:00.435
Oh, you did? And what
effect did that have?

01:23:01.853 --> 01:23:02.979
I see.

01:23:04.522 --> 01:23:06.316
So, uh, what did you do then?

01:23:08.652 --> 01:23:10.445
And what did they do?

01:23:11.488 --> 01:23:12.656
I see.

01:23:14.866 --> 01:23:18.244
Really? How many did you say?

01:23:19.788 --> 01:23:22.958
And how many acres does
this cemetery cover, sir?

01:23:23.875 --> 01:23:24.960
Yes.

01:23:26.086 --> 01:23:27.253
I see.

01:23:28.004 --> 01:23:29.129
I see.

01:23:29.130 --> 01:23:31.215
Yes, I see. Of course.

01:23:31.216 --> 01:23:33.509
Uh, thank you for your
assistance, Mr. Wilson.

01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:36.262
I'm going to switch you back to
Captain Turner now. He'll talk to you.

01:24:06.793 --> 01:24:09.420
Sir, this is Col. Glover.

01:24:09.421 --> 01:24:13.507
I'm sorry to disturb you at this
hour, but we're at Q-2 status.

01:24:13.508 --> 01:24:17.553
It looks like we've found that
lost consignment of Easter eggs.

01:24:19.764 --> 01:24:21.765
Yes, sir, pretty sure.

01:24:21.766 --> 01:24:23.475
They've turned up in Louisville.

01:24:23.476 --> 01:24:26.771
I'm getting confirmations on this
from the Louisville Police Department.

01:24:27.981 --> 01:24:29.941
Louisville, Kentucky, sir.

01:24:31.735 --> 01:24:33.569
Well, sir, it would be good news,

01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:36.196
except that the eggs have hatched.

01:24:36.197 --> 01:24:37.823
What are they doing, man?

01:24:37.824 --> 01:24:39.658
Hang on a second, would you?

01:24:39.659 --> 01:24:41.660
I dunno. It's weird.
These people seem to say

01:24:41.661 --> 01:24:43.620
th-they've been waiting
for this to happen.

01:24:43.621 --> 01:24:45.289
Apparently, they've got some sort of

01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:47.041
contingency plan to deal with it.

01:24:47.042 --> 01:24:48.542
Well, that's great!

Well, sir, only 20
square blocks destroyed.

Less than 4,000 dead, General.

01:26:16.881 --> 01:26:19.133
I wouldn't worry about
the fires, General.

01:26:19.134 --> 01:26:21.219
The rain is taking
care of that right now.

01:26:22.303 --> 01:26:24.429
Well, there have been
complaints about burning skin,

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:26.098
but I shouldn't worry.

01:26:26.099 --> 01:26:28.100
Minor irritation, General.

01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:30.144
The rain will wash everything away.

01:26:30.145 --> 01:26:33.730
That's correct, sir. All should
be back to normal by morning.

01:26:33.731 --> 01:26:35.315
Yes, sir, I understand the President

01:26:35.316 --> 01:26:37.192
will visit Louisville tomorrow.

01:26:37.193 --> 01:26:39.362
No, no, we wouldn't
want that to happen, sir.

01:26:40.363 --> 01:26:42.782
No, sir, this hasn't been
very pleasant for anyone.

01:26:44.367 --> 01:26:46.827
