          You're okay.

- Alright. Let's go, boys.
      - That's a good kid.

       The yoga teacher.

01:47.508 --> 01:50.676
- What? What happened?
       - You didn't hear?

01:50.678 --> 01:52.878
She was killed last night.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.379
In her own home.

01:54.381 --> 01:57.883
My God! That's so scary!
    Do they know who did it?

01:57.885 --> 02:00.752
I heard a neighbor
 saw someone leaving her house.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.387
They said it was a bagger
         at the Eagle.

02:02.389 --> 02:04.490
Wait, what? I was just there!

02:04.492 --> 02:07.159
I know. I'm there every day.

02:07.161 --> 02:09.328
He must've bagged my groceries
           500 times.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.797
Oh, it's so crazy
        to think about.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.266
I'm sure I have groceries
in my cupboards that he touched.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.268
I bet I have some in my trunk.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.872
How old was she?

02:19.874 --> 02:22.207
Late twenties, I think.

02:22.209 --> 02:24.710
Cheryl.. Cheryl something.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.045
- She opened that yoga studio.
             - Oh!

02:27.047 --> 02:29.581
- Did you know her?
           - Oh, no.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.184
I've just really been wanting
      to start doing yoga.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.853

Oh, my gosh,
     I didn't even notice.

02:41.028 --> 02:42.528
You have a new baby.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.596
Oh, yeah. Isn't she cute?

02:44.598 --> 02:46.665
We wanted to try
         something new.

        She's your baby.

Oh, Lisa, you can have her,
          she's great.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.715
- Are you sure?
       - Yes, I am sure.

Oh, we've just bonded. I've been
  her mom since she was born.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.856
She just has to get used to you.

What -- what you have
   to understand, sweetheart

05:07.007 --> 05:10.442
is when you fall down,
 it slows the whole game down.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.745
What happened to the baby?

05:13.747 --> 05:15.747
Oh, I gave her to Lisa.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.850
And, listen, honey,
 let's not mention to your dad

05:18.852 --> 05:21.586
how you fell down again today.
It'll just be our little secret.

05:21.588 --> 05:24.022
Can't I just sleep

06:10.804 --> 06:12.304
- Oh, yeah?

06:12.306 --> 06:13.939
There were cops everywhere.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.440
I guess they were waiting to see

06:15.442 --> 06:17.275
if that bagger showed up
           for work.

06:17.277 --> 06:20.145

 to the nursing home on Tuesday

13:31.645 --> 13:33.945
and mom wasn't in her room.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.648
She was in the cafeteria,
            mopping.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.249
One second, Dennis.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.952

          this morning
   during mom's exercise hour

14:02.409 --> 14:04.742
and, apparently,
    they had the whole group

14:04.744 --> 14:07.812
out, power washing the sun deck.

14:07.814 --> 14:10.849
Now, I told Nancy,
     power washing could be

14:10.851 --> 14:14.018
<i> considered exercise, but she</i>
   <i> made a really good point.</i>

14:14.020 --> 14:18.223
<i> It does seem like they fired</i>
 <i> the entire janitorial staff.</i>

14:21.628 --> 14:23.094
<i> And you know,</i>
      <i> Nancy's new husband</i>

14:23.096 --> 14:26.364
<i> he's an executive, you know?</i>
           <i> You know?</i>

14:26.366 --> 14:27.565
<i> You know?</i>

14:27.567 --> 14:29.934
<i> Well, he thinks</i>
   <i> that if the nursing home</i>

14:29.936 --> 14:33.905
is making the residence clean,
 they should pay them for that.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.274
Lisa?

14:36.276 --> 14:38.643
- Lisa? Lisa?
         - What? What?

14:38.645 --> 14:41.079
Do you think
     mom's being exploited?

14:41.081 --> 14:42.947
Do you think
   grandma's being exploited?

14:42.949 --> 14:45.717
Bob, don't play
       with that garbage.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.986
I'm making a corn-husk doll.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.255
<i> Yeesh.</i>

14:50.257 --> 14:52.790
- What?
     - It's a little scary.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.261
You're not scary to me.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.296
<i>Well, it'll be 20 more minutes</i>
        <i> on the goulash.</i>

14:58.298 --> 15:00.999
Bob, why don't you
  practice your saxophone now

15:01.001 --> 15:02.567
so that you don't
   have to do it before bed?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.736
- No!
            - Honey.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.171
<i> Sorry. It's just my head.</i>

15:07.173 --> 15:09.207
Oh, yeah, you should practice.

15:10.176 --> 15:12.110
You should practice, Bob.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.778
Your big concert is tomorrow.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.948
- I just want one free night.
             - Bob.

15:18.652 --> 15:20.118
Fine.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.255
You spilled some milk.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.090
[sighs]

15:26.092 --> 15:27.659
Can you clean it up?

15:28.795 --> 15:30.595
There's a rag right there.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.763
I..

Oh. Hi, Jill.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.426
Hi, Buck. How are you?

16:01.428 --> 16:04.095
Good, thanks. Real good.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.132
Mom, are you letting dad
        take the globe?

16:09.002 --> 16:10.835
Mm-mm, hide it.

16:10.837 --> 16:13.271
- No, mom.
         - Citronella.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.339
Fine.

16:15.642 --> 16:19.444
Hi, Kim Ann.
   I am so sorry to drop in.

16:19.446 --> 16:22.013
Oh, sit. I made lemonade.
        We're watching.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.253
I had no idea
   Buck was moving out today.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.389
Does anybody know?
      You can tell people.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.957
I feel like no one knows.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.526
Okay. Yeah, I'm not sure.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.830
- I'm pretty sure they don't.
             - Hm.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.099
Oh, I -- I brought you
          a taco dip.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.001
Seven layer?

16:43.003 --> 16:46.270
- It's a five.
           - Oh. Um..

16:46.272 --> 16:48.473
Put it on the floor.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.941
Just put it.

16:49.943 --> 16:51.309
- Okay.
         - That's good.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.079
- Have some lemonade.
           - Thanks.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.784
- Come on!
           - Dan! No!

16:59.786 --> 17:03.221
You be nice to your brother.
   He's small because of you.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.589
<i> Right?</i>

17:07.993 --> 17:10.094
Dan sat on Rostaffano
          in the womb.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.896
- You knew that, right?
         - Yeah, I do.

17:11.897 --> 17:14.432
He was born blue.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.567
Yeah, I know that. Hm.

17:18.938 --> 17:21.939
Listen, Kim Ann, I -- I wanna
     get out of your hair.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.473
I just wanted to check on you.

17:23.476 --> 17:27.811
Okay, I figured you were here
      to buy some knives.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.648
You know, since you missed
my last Elizabeth Knives party.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.251
Oh, sorry, yeah.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.620
No, but I could buy
       some knives today.

17:35.622 --> 17:39.290
- I do have my checkbook.
  - Okay, that would be great.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.192
- Okay.
            - But..

17:41.194 --> 17:43.828

Um, Kim Ann?

17:54.474 --> 17:55.606
Hm?

17:55.608 --> 17:57.575
You would tell me
       if I did something

17:57.577 --> 17:59.677
to upset you, right?

17:59.679 --> 18:01.012
Mm-hmm.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.247
Okay.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.918
- You did something to upset me.
            - I did?

18:06.920 --> 18:09.854
Honestly,
I just can't believe everything

18:09.856 --> 18:13.357
that happened with your baby.

18:13.359 --> 18:16.194
You just gave your baby to Lisa.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.262
That's really fucked up, Jill.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.832
I know.

18:20.834 --> 18:23.267
I think
   I made a horrible mistake.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.403
Yeah.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.539
Why would you give your baby
      to Lisa and not me?

Oh, I -- I'm so sorry, Kim Ann.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.946

 on giving my baby away at all.

You know,

18:40.753 --> 18:44.622
I really miss Madison.
           Um, Paige.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.525
You know, I would've
     kept her name Madison

18:47.527 --> 18:49.460
if you had given her to me.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.395
That was my mother's name.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.699
I know,
 that's who I named her after.

    the kids tested into it.

21:00.326 --> 21:03.494
What test?
   Bob never took that test.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.663
Oh, I think
     it was the state test.

- The one they took in April.

- I didn't want to play that.
     - That doesn't matter.

You were supposed to.
      You embarrassed us.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.964
don't want you
    going on the field trip.

26:06.966 --> 26:11.068
Ms. Human, our parents
     are getting divorced.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.671
- They are?
             - Yes.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.839
We're supposed to tell people.

26:15.841 --> 26:18.008
Oh. Okay.

26:18.778 --> 26:19.977
Now I know.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.647
All of you who didn't turn in
     your permission slips

26:23.649 --> 26:25.349
make sure that you do so
           by Friday

26:25.351 --> 26:28.752
or you will not be going
     to the Prairie Museum.

26:31.891 --> 26:35.392
Now, many of the settlers
         who moved west

26:35.394 --> 26:38.262
left behind good lives,
      because they thought

26:38.264 --> 26:41.899
"Hm, maybe I could have
        a better life."

26:41.901 --> 26:46.036
They left behind everything
       they couldn't fit
    in their covered wagons.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.572
Families, friends

26:48.574 --> 26:51.442
churches they loved, big beds.

26:53.879 --> 26:58.482
You all have an outline
  of a wagon in front of you.

26:58.484 --> 27:00.884
If you had to pick up
       and move tomorrow

27:00.886 --> 27:03.887
what would you bring
        in your wagons?

27:10.396 --> 27:12.963
Bob, you wanna be in my wagon?

27:14.266 --> 27:15.633
No.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.939
[knocking on door]

27:25.444 --> 27:26.844
I'll be right back.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.815
- Hi.
      - Hi. Hi, Ms. Human.

27:31.817 --> 27:34.952
There's undies here, too.
 I brought extra for his cubby.

27:34.954 --> 27:37.755
I'm sorry, I thought
    I gave you extra before.

27:38.557 --> 27:39.957
You did.

27:40.726 --> 27:43.394
Oh. Okay.

27:43.396 --> 27:46.163
I'm really sorry.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.465
- Okay. Yeah.
       - And, Ms. Human?

27:48.467 --> 27:50.367
The next time this happens

27:50.369 --> 27:53.437
can you please not call
      my husband's office?

27:54.473 --> 27:57.107
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

27:58.477 --> 27:59.910
[chuckles]

28:01.013 --> 28:03.280
Hey, um,
  he soiled the beanbag chair.

28:03.282 --> 28:06.050
- Oh?
     - Yeah, it's stained.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.651
The beanbag chair?

28:08.654 --> 28:11.155
- Yeah.
        - Oh, I'm sorry.

28:11.157 --> 28:13.991
Well, let me take the cover
      home, I'll wash it.

28:15.261 --> 28:16.994
The beans are loose inside.

28:17.663 --> 28:20.664
Oh. Okay.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.466
I'll replace it.

28:22.468 --> 28:25.402
I -- it's, um,
  it's not really replaceable.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.538
My mother made it

28:27.540 --> 28:29.573
before she killed my father.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.343
- Oh.
       - And my brother.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.946
And my sister, too.

28:37.817 --> 28:41.318
Oh, that's right.
  I'm so sorry, that's awful.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.053
I know.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.955
Okay.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.724
Thanks for the undies.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.626
Oh.

28:56.936 --> 28:57.968
[chuckles]

29:03.709 --> 29:06.110
Oh. Thanks.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.417
Marriott, hi.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.285
Are you playing tennis today?

29:15.287 --> 29:17.988
Hi, Jill. No.

29:17.990 --> 29:21.125
Are you going
   to some kind of pie event?

29:22.261 --> 29:23.494
No.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.630
Well, nice to see you.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.533
Wait, Marriott.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.902
Um, I wanted to say,
y -- you should bring Raja over

29:31.904 --> 29:34.271
to swim sometime. The pool's
    finally up and running.

29:34.273 --> 29:37.908
- Oh, no, thank you.
             - No?

29:37.910 --> 29:40.544
Actually, I don't know
        how to say this.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.112
What is it?

29:42.114 --> 29:46.617
The other day I overheard Raja
      say the word "Butt."

29:46.619 --> 29:49.386
- Butt?
         - Yeah, butt.

29:49.388 --> 29:51.155
She heard it from Julian.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.756
He was talking about
         Popeye's butt.

29:52.758 --> 29:55.459
About how much bigger
       Popeye's butt gets

29:55.461 --> 29:57.027
when he eats spinach.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.197
Is that even true?

30:00.866 --> 30:02.166
Yeah.

30:03.202 --> 30:05.235
I am so sorry.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.939
Thank you for telling me.

30:09.341 --> 30:10.741
Mm-hmm.

     Chuck, you never fail
        to crack me up.

              Oh..

30:25.991 --> 30:29.593
Coming up after the break,
      a possible sighting
     of the bagger murderer

30:29.595 --> 30:32.596

          Donna Clank.

Alright, focus up, Julian.
    Get the ball back to me.

What? What happened, baby?

32:33.452 --> 32:35.552
Daddy hit me with a ball.

32:35.554 --> 32:38.155
He was messing around.

32:38.157 --> 32:40.924
You have to catch it, Julian,
     then it won't hit you.

32:40.926 --> 32:43.527
He didn't even try. We're
 wasting our money on baseball.

Julian, don't you wanna be
       on the All-Star's?

32:50.903 --> 32:53.070
Bob is trying out
 and so are Dan and Rostaffano.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.671
Everyone makes the team.

32:54.673 --> 32:59.076
Did you remember
  to buy me a new toothbrush?

32:59.078 --> 33:02.079
- Yes.
         - What color?

33:02.081 --> 33:04.081
Oh, red, it's red.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.783
I never had a red toothbrush.

33:06.785 --> 33:08.585
Yes, you have!

33:10.055 --> 33:12.723
Mommy, can I watch "Popeye?"

33:12.725 --> 33:14.725
No, baby, it's a school night.

 I honestly think it's too big.

We just already had
such a big hole there, you know

horse skeleton in our backyard.

Oh, do you know they actually
sent it off to be carbon dated?

Apparently, it's much older
  than they initially thought.

        all these years

38:45.991 --> 38:48.158
we might have been sleeping
   above a prehistoric horse.

38:48.160 --> 38:51.094
- Unbelievable.
 - Well, it can't be that old.

38:51.096 --> 38:52.996
There weren't even horses
        in North America

38:52.998 --> 38:54.331
until, like, the 1600s.

38:54.333 --> 38:56.032
Oh, yeah, I was thinking
        about that, too

38:56.034 --> 38:57.667
and then I remembered Pangaea.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.069
Oh, my God!

38:59.071 --> 39:02.005
Jill, what if your property
      was part of Pangaea?

39:02.007 --> 39:03.273
What's Pangaea?

39:03.275 --> 39:05.241
You stop that. We're Christian.

39:05.243 --> 39:06.543
Oh..

39:06.545 --> 39:08.011
It's okay, sweetie.

39:10.082 --> 39:12.215
We'll be back.

39:12.217 --> 39:14.684
Julian, do you have to go?

39:14.686 --> 39:16.786
I gotta get some chips.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.222
Great.

39:23.261 --> 39:26.563
<i> Julian, please,</i>
   <i> just go to the bathroom.</i>

39:26.565 --> 39:30.200
- I know you have to.
       - I don't have to.

39:30.202 --> 39:33.236
Please. You can't
   have an accident tonight.

39:33.238 --> 39:36.906
I don't have to go,
        I never have to.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.075
Well, we're not leaving
    this room until you go.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.845
Good! I love this room.

39:41.847 --> 39:44.214
Julian, I'm begging you,
     please use the toilet.

39:44.216 --> 39:45.949
I could live in here.

39:47.386 --> 39:48.418
That's it, I've had it.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.320
- Give me that Purple Heart.
             - No!

39:50.322 --> 39:52.389
You're not allowed to wear
grandpa's Purple Heart anymore.

39:52.391 --> 39:53.790
But it's Hawaiian!

39:53.792 --> 39:55.959
Your grandpa didn't lose his leg
            in Oahu

39:55.961 --> 39:57.460
for you to bring shame
         to his medal.

39:57.462 --> 39:58.862
Daddy said I could wear it.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.130
He said you could wear it
        if you're good!

40:00.132 --> 40:02.265
But you're not,
       you're being bad!

40:02.267 --> 40:05.268
[dramatic music]

40:06.004 --> 40:07.804
[men laughing]

40:07.806 --> 40:10.807
We were all laying out
    in the grass one night.

40:10.809 --> 40:12.776
- All of us men.
             - Hm.

40:12.778 --> 40:16.579
And Nick and I looked up
     and saw the Big Dipper

40:16.581 --> 40:19.115
and then the little one.

40:19.117 --> 40:23.319
And I asked Nick, "Which one
    do you think is better?"

40:23.321 --> 40:25.722
And he goes, "Well, Dennis

40:25.724 --> 40:28.425
"you can't have one
       without the other.

40:28.427 --> 40:30.927
On their own,
  they're both just dippers."

40:30.929 --> 40:33.930
[laughing]

40:36.401 --> 40:38.401
Yeah!

40:38.403 --> 40:41.004
- You are so funny.
           - The man!

40:41.006 --> 40:43.540
[laughing]

40:43.542 --> 40:44.874
Julian?

40:44.876 --> 40:46.810
What's he doing?

40:46.812 --> 40:49.813
[intense music]

40:56.188 --> 40:57.787
<i> Honey?</i>

40:57.789 --> 41:00.190
Dear dad.

[music continues]

41:47.372 --> 41:49.606
- What in the world?
     - That's a dog, right?

41:49.608 --> 41:53.176
I don't have a dog,
    but I know that's a dog.

41:53.178 --> 41:55.979
He's wearing
his grandfather's Purple Heart.

41:55.981 --> 41:58.515
Julian, are you a dog now?

41:58.517 --> 42:00.617
Julian, is that you?

42:00.619 --> 42:03.620
[music continues]

42:08.426 --> 42:09.759
It's him.

42:10.996 --> 42:12.262
Yeah.

42:17.235 --> 42:19.035
Hey, buddy. Hey.

42:35.954 --> 42:38.121
Mm..

42:38.123 --> 42:40.223
Smaller bites, Julian.
     No one likes a piggy.

42:46.998 --> 42:48.731
[bell ringing]

42:48.733 --> 42:50.233
Julian, come on.

42:50.235 --> 42:52.235
We're late, we're late.

42:54.072 --> 42:56.439
Okay, you've got your math book.

42:56.441 --> 42:58.441
Your homework's
      in the front zipper.

42:58.443 --> 43:01.110
Oh, Julian, you need
 your glasses to see the board.

43:01.112 --> 43:03.580
Come on, baby, please.

43:03.582 --> 43:05.982
Please, just try. Keep them on.

43:05.984 --> 43:08.751
Oh, Julian. Oh..

43:08.753 --> 43:12.088
Snake bites, cholera

drowning

43:13.258 --> 43:16.459
an ox kick to the head.

43:16.461 --> 43:18.561
The majority of pioneers
       who traveled west

43:18.563 --> 43:20.697
died
 along the treacherous journey.

43:20.699 --> 43:22.465
<i> Everyone has a worksheet</i>
         <i> on your desk.</i>

43:22.467 --> 43:24.567
<i> You'll see on the right side</i>
       <i> of your worksheet</i>

43:24.569 --> 43:28.438
a list of the six most common
causes of death on the frontier.

43:28.440 --> 43:30.573
And on the left side,
        six blank spaces

43:30.575 --> 43:33.543
for you to fill in
  your closest family members.

43:33.545 --> 43:37.513
I want you to take your markers
          and connect
    each of your loved ones

43:37.515 --> 43:41.250
to the way you imagine
        they would die.

43:41.252 --> 43:44.787
-<i> Yes, Shad?</i>
 - Should we include ourselves?

43:44.789 --> 43:46.189
Yes.

43:47.058 --> 43:49.292
Okay, class, let's review.

43:49.294 --> 43:52.061
What was the main source of
 income for the prairie people?

43:52.063 --> 43:53.663
Corn, farming corn!

43:53.665 --> 43:56.332
That's right, Bob.
 Let's raise our hands, though.

43:56.334 --> 44:00.370
Come on, Julian. Hi, Ms. Human,
   I'm so sorry to interrupt.

44:00.372 --> 44:03.506
Um, I have Julian here.

44:03.508 --> 44:05.875
He's a dog now.

44:05.877 --> 44:07.377
Oh.

44:07.379 --> 44:10.647
Well, he's tardy.

44:10.649 --> 44:13.750
Okay. Come on, Julian.

44:13.752 --> 44:15.385
Come on, Julian, right here.

44:16.721 --> 44:19.288
Julian, honey.
 Right here, this is your desk.

44:19.290 --> 44:20.690
This is your desk.

44:22.894 --> 44:25.228
Hi, Julian.

44:25.230 --> 44:28.231
Raja, you can play with Julian
           at recess.

44:32.203 --> 44:33.369
[sighs]

44:36.141 --> 44:38.207
Now, Dan, can you name

44:38.209 --> 44:40.943
the most successful sharecropper
      ever in this county?

44:40.945 --> 44:43.346
[chuckles]
           Your mom.

44:43.348 --> 44:46.115
[giggling]

44:46.117 --> 44:49.318
That's right. My mom.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.821
Denise Human.

45:22.053 --> 45:24.520
Jill. Hi, how are you?

45:24.522 --> 45:26.989
Does Julian seem
       really different?

45:26.991 --> 45:28.991
Um, yeah.

45:28.993 --> 45:31.694
Wow. Yeah.

45:31.696 --> 45:32.995
I have a bunch of robes.

45:32.997 --> 45:35.398
I was just bringing them over
    for the clothing drive.

45:35.400 --> 45:36.499
- Robes?
            - Yeah.

45:36.501 --> 45:39.202
I got four
    for Christmas last year.

45:39.204 --> 45:41.170
- Oh.
       - Do you want one?

45:41.172 --> 45:43.673
- No, that's okay.
       - Oh, excuse you.

45:43.675 --> 45:44.741
Hm.

45:44.743 --> 45:47.276
Okay, good to see you.

45:47.278 --> 45:48.945
[chuckles]

45:48.947 --> 45:50.580
Wait, Lisa, I..

45:50.582 --> 45:53.049
- I wanted to talk to you.
            - Yeah?

45:53.051 --> 45:56.085
Well, I don't want to be
        an Indian giver.

45:56.087 --> 45:59.188
Oh, Jill, it's not okay
      to say that anymore.

45:59.190 --> 46:00.656
Oh, sorry.

46:00.658 --> 46:03.693
Um, I don't wanna be
    a Native-American giver.

46:03.695 --> 46:06.229
- Mm-hmm.
     - But I wanted to ask.

46:06.231 --> 46:08.698
Now that my only child is a dog

46:08.700 --> 46:12.602
would it be possible for me
to get the baby I gave you back?

46:14.272 --> 46:15.738
Oh.

46:16.875 --> 46:18.775
I don't know, Jill.

46:18.777 --> 46:22.945
Um, I can see
   why you would ask me that.

46:22.947 --> 46:25.681
But I just don't think
    Dennis would go for it.

46:27.185 --> 46:30.353
Oh. Okay.

46:30.355 --> 46:34.223
Well, doesn't hurt to ask,
             right?

46:34.225 --> 46:36.425
[instrumental music]

46:36.427 --> 46:39.629
It did hurt. I didn't like it.

46:43.067 --> 46:45.067
Sorry.

46:45.069 --> 46:46.369
Hm.

Come get me, boy! There you go!
    There you go! Yeah! Oh!

He's so fast, Jill.
        It's incredible.

48:04.849 --> 48:07.884
He's actually trying.
    I got tired before him.

48:10.822 --> 48:13.222
Honey, is everything okay?

48:14.792 --> 48:17.393
- It's just, he's so different.
           - I know.

48:17.395 --> 48:18.694
Heh. I know.

48:24.669 --> 48:28.104
- Sweetheart, you seem sad.
           - Oh, oh..

48:28.106 --> 48:30.773
You have to admit,
   this is a lot to process.

48:32.243 --> 48:35.711
Um...Jill

48:35.713 --> 48:38.514
I think he's going through
 a bigger change than you are.

48:42.086 --> 48:44.387
Yeah, of course.

48:47.792 --> 48:49.258
Julian, wash up, dinner's ready.

48:49.260 --> 48:50.660
No, it's not.

48:51.596 --> 48:54.430
<i> Oh, that's sweet.</i>

48:54.432 --> 48:56.832
I think it's pretty when they
are lumped together liked this.

48:56.834 --> 48:59.702
Yes, the lump's too good.
           It's fun.

Hey, congrats, man.

- Julian Davies?
        - Yes, our son.

50:12.176 --> 50:15.578
Oh! Well, we can't have him
 on the field. It's regulation.

50:15.580 --> 50:17.380
He's the fastest one out there.

50:17.382 --> 50:19.181
I'm sorry, Nick,
    he keeps going offsides.

50:19.183 --> 50:20.416
- Offsides?
            - Yeah.

50:20.418 --> 50:21.684
Come on, man, he's seven!

50:21.686 --> 50:24.653
He can't kick.
 He doesn't get it. I'm sorry.

50:27.725 --> 50:31.494
- But..
       - I can't believe
       I dated that guy.

"He can't be on the field.

50:52.250 --> 50:54.550
I can't! Gosh, I can't.

50:54.552 --> 50:56.952
[laughing]

50:57.989 --> 50:59.922
- Uh..
       - Oh, that's good.

51:00.858 --> 51:03.793
- Oh..
       - Oh, that's good.

51:03.795 --> 51:06.062
Julian, don't eat grass.

      <i> for coming tonight.</i>

51:15.406 --> 51:16.939
<i> Your presence warms my heart.</i>

51:16.941 --> 51:19.008
She was so young.

51:19.010 --> 51:20.176
I appreciate your presence.

51:20.178 --> 51:23.412
Just makes you think, "Why her?"

51:23.414 --> 51:24.914
<i> Thank you so much</i>
        <i> for being here.</i>

51:24.916 --> 51:28.017
Yeah, why her?

51:28.019 --> 51:31.454
<i> Thank you for your presence</i>
         <i> here tonight.</i>

51:31.456 --> 51:35.091
You know, Buck's gotten
   really into western wear.

51:35.093 --> 51:38.127
- Western wear?
- Yeah, ever since the divorce.

51:38.129 --> 51:39.161
Our divorce!

51:39.163 --> 51:40.429
<i> Thank you for coming tonight.</i>

51:40.431 --> 51:43.332
Dennis said Buck's living
     above the post office.

51:43.334 --> 51:45.935
Yeah, he can fart all he wants
           up there.

51:47.638 --> 51:48.771
<i> Thank you so much</i>
        <i> for being here.</i>

51:48.773 --> 51:51.941
Your presence means
        so much beyond.

51:51.943 --> 51:53.943
Excuse me. Excuse me, everyone.

51:53.945 --> 51:55.744
<i> Have your attention, please.</i>

51:55.746 --> 51:59.582
Thank you all so much
    for being here tonight.

51:59.584 --> 52:03.352
Exactly one month ago,
     my sister, Cheryl Hoad

52:03.354 --> 52:06.188
returned home after teaching
    her favorite yoga class

52:06.190 --> 52:09.158
Baby Bikram,
    to find her home invaded

52:09.160 --> 52:13.195
and her walk-in closet
       completely empty.

52:13.197 --> 52:16.232
A neighbor reported
 seeing a bagger from the Eagle

52:16.234 --> 52:17.666
trying to walk across
         the cul-de-sac

52:17.668 --> 52:20.636
wearing all of Cheryl's clothes,
      which, to be honest

52:20.638 --> 52:22.905
included a lot of clothes
     I had let her borrow.

52:22.907 --> 52:24.673
I'm smaller than her,
        but she can wear

52:24.675 --> 52:27.309
some of my stretchier items.

52:27.311 --> 52:30.980
The bagger also left with all
 of Cheryl's gymnastics medals.

52:30.982 --> 52:34.250
I could never do gymnastics
because I have a delicate knee.

52:35.820 --> 52:40.656
Cheryl was a beloved sister,
  daughter and ex-girlfriend.

52:40.658 --> 52:43.025
Her ex-boyfriend, Rob,
        is here tonight.

52:43.027 --> 52:45.194
I set them up
   because Rob's not my type.

52:45.196 --> 52:46.495
Rob?

52:48.399 --> 52:49.665
<i> Rob?</i>

52:50.668 --> 52:52.201
- You dated Cheryl?
             -<i> Rob?</i>

52:52.203 --> 52:53.636
- I mean, kinda.
             -<i> Rob.</i>

52:53.638 --> 52:55.905
I think everyone would like
 to hear you talk about Cheryl.

52:55.907 --> 52:57.773
- I'm so sorry.
             - No.

52:57.775 --> 52:59.675
It.. I really don't think --

52:59.677 --> 53:02.645
- Just a little bit louder, Rob.
            - Okay.

53:02.647 --> 53:06.649
Um...hey, everybody.

53:06.651 --> 53:08.517
I'm Rob.

53:08.519 --> 53:10.319
Your presence warms my heart.
       Thank you so much.

53:10.321 --> 53:13.322
Uh, Cheryl and I dated

53:13.324 --> 53:17.293
what, two months ago?

53:17.295 --> 53:19.161
You know, it was mainly
       night-time stuff.

53:19.163 --> 53:21.030
Um, I don't know
       what else to say.

53:21.032 --> 53:22.665
I mean, it didn't end up
          working out.

53:22.667 --> 53:26.368
But, uh, it's how
I would've had it with Crystal.

53:26.370 --> 53:28.537
<i> Crystal's my new girlfriend.</i>

53:28.539 --> 53:30.973
<i> Crystal, did you maybe wanna</i>
  <i> say something about Cheryl?</i>

53:33.311 --> 53:34.610
Um..

53:37.048 --> 53:40.883
I didn't know Cheryl.
 I didn't know you guys dated.

53:40.885 --> 53:42.418
- Okay.
  - No, yeah, I had, we had --

53:42.420 --> 53:43.586
Rob, I just think
      everyone would like

53:43.588 --> 53:45.387
to hear you
     talk about Cheryl now.

53:45.389 --> 53:46.522
Right.

53:47.792 --> 53:48.924
Uh..

53:54.632 --> 53:56.732
Cheryl had a beautiful face.

53:56.734 --> 53:58.867
I see it all over town now.

53:58.869 --> 54:01.937
It's haunting
      to think about that.

54:04.275 --> 54:07.309
If what happened to Cheryl
      happened to Crystal

54:07.311 --> 54:09.311
I don't know
     what I would do and..

54:10.915 --> 54:12.848
Oh, God!

54:12.850 --> 54:15.084
Oh, honey..

54:15.086 --> 54:16.218
Rob, I think
    we should go back down.

54:16.220 --> 54:17.653
I love you so much,
      I don't want to have

54:17.655 --> 54:19.288
anything bad happen to you.

54:22.093 --> 54:24.460
I love you more than my mom,
            I think.

54:26.664 --> 54:28.631
Is that okay, mom?

54:28.633 --> 54:31.033
- Mm-mm.
             - No.

54:31.035 --> 54:33.035
<i> We really should get off</i>
          <i> the porch.</i>

55:07.605 --> 55:08.671
Dennis!

55:11.609 --> 55:13.942
- Lisa, you look so --
            - What?

55:13.944 --> 55:16.111
Your legs look so long.

55:18.449 --> 55:20.749
Where's the remote?
     Bob, close your eyes.

55:20.751 --> 55:22.885
Oh, my God,
  this is "Kids With Knives!"

Uh, sweetheart, let me zip up

It's backless.

    don't even let me drive!

 going to have your hands full.

- I have to talk to you.

- No.
  - Come on, it's really good.

Yeah, but frozen.

   with his branding, Wilson

 Why not just name him Wilson?"

01:01:33.223 --> 01:01:34.990
I'm so sorry.

01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:37.626
They're not bars,
     they're just brownies.

01:01:37.628 --> 01:01:40.062
I'm really sorry about that.

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:47.836

01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:00.916
I finally started reading
     "Mating In Captivity."

01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:04.052
- I love it.
     - Oh, she is so smart.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:06.288
I had to follow along
        with my finger.

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:09.057
- I've been reading it out loud.
            - Yeah.

Hello, class.

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:55.437
And thank you...for being here..

01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:00.909
with all of your chakras.

01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:02.110
Ch..

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:03.345
Uh, Cheryl didn't leave

01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:07.582
any instructions, so..

01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:12.521
Uh..

01:03:12.523 --> 01:03:14.723

01:03:14.725 --> 01:03:16.725

             - Yes!

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:09.878
Dan, Rostaffano,
      stop holding hands.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.747
- Hi, Kim Ann.
        - Hi, Marriott.

01:04:12.749 --> 01:04:14.816
Are you an ice dancer?

01:04:14.818 --> 01:04:17.219
No. Are you pregnant?

01:04:17.988 --> 01:04:19.020
No.

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:22.824
Can the twins
 come to Magic America with us?

01:04:22.826 --> 01:04:24.359
Oh! Ah..

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:26.928
We didn't bring a present
      because Raja wanted

01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:29.064
to invite the twins
       to Magic America.

01:04:29.066 --> 01:04:30.866
Oh, I see.

01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:35.237
Um, well, Rostaffano
   can't ride roller coasters

01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:37.038
because of his heart.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.440
Oh.

01:04:38.442 --> 01:04:41.710
You know he was sat on
          in the womb.

01:04:41.712 --> 01:04:43.445
Didn't you know that?
    I thought everyone knew.

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:46.147
I -- I must've known.

01:04:48.952 --> 01:04:50.352
[Buck sighs]

01:04:57.461 --> 01:04:59.928
Citronella, does your mom
       ever ask about me?

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:01.796
Dad.

01:05:01.798 --> 01:05:04.332
Well, did you give her the check
  I gave you, for the knives?

01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:05.400
Those are for girls.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:07.836
[scoffs]

01:05:07.838 --> 01:05:10.739
She said the check you gave her
         wasn't enough.

01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:12.540
You don't get the discount
            anymore.

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:13.775
Well, fuck!

01:05:13.777 --> 01:05:15.076
[gasps]

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:16.411
Now, listen up, kiddo,
      this ball's gonna be

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:19.214
a little heavier than your ball
       at home, alright?

01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:21.616
To be honest,
      I'm a little worried
about you on these slick floors.

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:24.119
Don't run as fast as you do
   in the backyard, alright?

01:05:24.121 --> 01:05:26.855
You'll be fine.
  Just take it nice and easy.

01:05:26.857 --> 01:05:30.191
- Here we go, right here.
     - Lisa, where is Bob?

01:05:30.193 --> 01:05:33.795
- He's not here. He's grounded.
            - Again?

01:05:33.797 --> 01:05:35.397
He's going through
       a bit of a phase.

01:05:35.399 --> 01:05:37.532
Raja said he's had to stay late
    for detention every day.

01:05:37.534 --> 01:05:39.534
I think she has a little bit
     of a crush on him now.

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:40.969
[chuckling]

01:05:40.971 --> 01:05:44.072
Yeah. Uh, no, he has to stay
 late, but it's not detention.

01:05:44.074 --> 01:05:47.575
You can tell Raja. It's, um..
   He's in Rocket Math, yeah.

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:50.545
- He's in Rocket Math now.
             - Wow!

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:53.982
- Bob is in Rocket Math?
   - Yeah. Yeah, he is, Jill.

01:05:53.984 --> 01:05:56.551
Um, Julian
   probably didn't mention it

01:05:56.553 --> 01:05:59.988
'cause he's a dog, but, yeah.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:05.160
Actually, uh, Julian
 isn't in Rocket Math anymore.

01:06:05.162 --> 01:06:07.262
- He's not?
             - No.

01:06:07.264 --> 01:06:08.797
I -- I was really upset
           at first,

01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:10.231
but then Nick made a good point.

01:06:10.233 --> 01:06:12.133
He's probably not gonna be
         an accountant.

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:13.535
Mm..

01:06:13.537 --> 01:06:17.205
- Nick said that?
            - Yeah.

01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:19.441
I really don't like
       that he said that.

01:06:19.443 --> 01:06:22.510
Well, I'm sorry,
     did anyone ask Julian

01:06:22.512 --> 01:06:24.112
if he wants to be an accountant?

01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:25.981
No, but --

01:06:26.917 --> 01:06:28.850
Jill?

01:06:28.852 --> 01:06:32.187
- Are you happy?
             - Huh?

01:06:32.189 --> 01:06:35.090
Are you really happy?

01:06:35.993 --> 01:06:37.926
I don't know.

01:06:37.928 --> 01:06:39.294
Maybe you should get a divorce.

01:06:39.296 --> 01:06:41.096
Oh, yes!

01:06:41.098 --> 01:06:42.230
Really?

01:06:42.232 --> 01:06:43.798
- Yes.
             - Yes.

01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:47.402
- Oh.
            - Okay.

01:06:48.405 --> 01:06:50.071
Wait, Nick?

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:51.606
[panting]

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:57.412
I.. Julian, can I have
   a moment with your father?

01:06:57.414 --> 01:06:59.280
Oh, sure. Go ahead, boy.

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:02.017
I want a divorce.

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:07.922
- I'm sorry, Nick.
             - Oh.

01:07:07.924 --> 01:07:09.357
I think we should get a divorce.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.960
No, no, stop that.
    We could talk about it.

01:07:11.962 --> 01:07:13.628
Hey, what is, what's wrong?

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:15.330
I..

01:07:15.332 --> 01:07:18.400
- Oh. Well, oh..
          - I'm sorry.

01:07:18.402 --> 01:07:20.068
No, don't do that.
         Don't do that.

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:22.270
I don't want that.
       What are you ta..
  What are you talking about?

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:24.339
Don't.. What are you doing?
       Honey, stop this.

01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:26.474
Did you hear me? I think
   we have to get a divorce.

01:07:26.476 --> 01:07:27.575
You don't know
   what you're talking about.

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:29.377
Stop that.
  What are you talking about?

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:32.914
Then why are you doing this
  in front of all our friends?

01:07:32.916 --> 01:07:34.649

   <i> We can talk about this --</i>

        - I just did it.

I -- I can change,
I can fix it, whatever you want.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.860
- No.
  - I'll do whatever you want.

01:07:45.862 --> 01:07:47.195
I don't understand this either.

- Please, please.
             - I..

01:07:49.466 --> 01:07:51.699
No, married people hug.

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:54.436

Then don't.

    both love you very much

if your dad moves in with Buck
     above the post office.

01:08:33.376 --> 01:08:35.210
What?

01:08:35.212 --> 01:08:37.812
As you know, Julian,
 Kim Ann recently got a divorce

01:08:37.814 --> 01:08:41.149
and she says she's much happier,
    so now my friends think
    I should get a divorce.

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:42.649
Well, I don't wanna live
           with Buck.

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:44.853
- He farts in his sleep.
        - Nick, please.

<i> No, you please.</i>
<i>I don't wanna do this! Stop it!</i>

<i> Julian, we want you to know</i>
  <i> that this is not your fault</i>

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:54.863
and it absolutely has nothing
 to do with you not being able
    to play soccer anymore.

Well, you didn't want
         to divorce me

when he could still play soccer.

  that you can't play soccer.

- What?
             - Why?

01:11:49.139 --> 01:11:52.740
That woman wants to sit her body
         on something.

01:11:52.742 --> 01:11:54.676
For the picture.

01:11:55.412 --> 01:11:58.479

I -- I just wanted
       any kind of chair.

01:12:22.439 --> 01:12:24.639
We don't have any other chairs.

01:12:25.475 --> 01:12:27.442
That one was really expensive.

     - It's not a problem.

 You don't have any clothes on.

Nick took Julian.

01:15:27.557 --> 01:15:30.725
Ah. Jill, I know.
     Nick called over here.

01:15:30.727 --> 01:15:33.828
You have to help me.
    We have to get him back.

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:36.831
Jill, I think it might be best
           for Julian

01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:39.433
to stay with Nick for a while.

01:15:39.435 --> 01:15:43.271
What? He's all I have.

01:15:43.273 --> 01:15:45.773
Nick said
 you left him home alone, Jill.

01:15:45.775 --> 01:15:48.442
- Yeah, but --
         - He's seven.

01:15:48.444 --> 01:15:51.479
Nick found him naked
          in the yard.

01:15:51.481 --> 01:15:54.015
Well, I was just gonna be gone
        for one minute.

01:15:54.017 --> 01:15:56.217
He sleeps so much now.

01:15:56.219 --> 01:16:00.054
A haircut is not one minute.
   You clearly got a blowout.

01:16:00.056 --> 01:16:02.957
- It looks good.
           - Thanks.

01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:05.860
You're going through a lot
           right now.

01:16:05.862 --> 01:16:08.663
I think you should go home
        and take a bath.

01:16:10.767 --> 01:16:13.901
Do you want me to walk you home
       and draw the bath?

01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:17.305
No, that's okay.

01:16:18.007 --> 01:16:19.607
Okay.

01:16:19.609 --> 01:16:22.743
Just -- just let me know
 if there's anything I can do.

01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:26.047
Okay. Thanks.

01:16:29.319 --> 01:16:30.585

01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:34.488
Yeah?

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:37.558
Well...now that I don't have

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.394
any family anymore

01:16:40.396 --> 01:16:44.165
is there any way you'd consider
    giving me my baby back?

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:49.570
No, Jill.

01:16:49.572 --> 01:16:51.939
And I don't want you
   to ever ask me that again.

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:53.441
- Lisa..
             - No!

01:16:53.443 --> 01:16:55.443
Don't make me feel like
    I'm some kind of monster

01:16:55.445 --> 01:16:58.279
for not giving you my baby!

01:16:58.281 --> 01:17:00.948
You gave her to me, Jill.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.050
I love her just as much

01:17:03.052 --> 01:17:06.120
as I love Bob and Twilson.

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:10.424
But, Lisa, you have so many kids
        and I have none.

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:12.193
You did that to yourself.

01:17:12.195 --> 01:17:15.029
You can't possibly think
    I'm gonna give you Paige

01:17:15.031 --> 01:17:17.231
just so you can go
and leave her naked in the yard.

01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:18.633
Her name is Madison!

01:17:18.635 --> 01:17:23.104

01:24:17.019 --> 01:24:19.119
Uh, so I thought..

01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:21.188
...if I could just come here

01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:24.358
and sit on the toilet
      I used to think on..

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:27.428
Mm-mm, I need to get these kids
          back to bed.

01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:28.896
Oh, of course.

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.934
Are the..
  Are these all your children?

01:24:35.471 --> 01:24:36.537
Yes.

01:24:37.173 --> 01:24:38.772
Oh, my God.

01:24:42.511 --> 01:24:44.078
[Jill chuckles]

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.612
They're so beautiful.

01:24:45.614 --> 01:24:48.549
Oh, okay, ma'am,
  I'm sorry, I can't help you.

01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:50.084
You have to go.

01:24:50.086 --> 01:24:52.519
Excuse me, actually..

01:24:52.521 --> 01:24:53.520
Um..

01:24:54.723 --> 01:24:56.857
Would it be okay

01:24:56.859 --> 01:24:58.959
if it's not too much trouble..

01:24:59.762 --> 01:25:00.794
Yeah?

01:25:03.766 --> 01:25:06.233
Could I have
     one of your children?

01:25:10.172 --> 01:25:12.673
- Okay, okay, no.
            - Wait.

01:25:12.675 --> 01:25:14.541
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

01:25:14.543 --> 01:25:15.976
[door latches]

01:25:23.419 --> 01:25:26.420
[sobbing]

01:25:36.832 --> 01:25:37.898
[switch clicks]

01:25:40.069 --> 01:25:43.070
[sobbing]

01:25:49.245 --> 01:25:51.245
[Jill sobbing]

01:25:55.551 --> 01:25:58.552
[sobbing]

01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:09.630
<i> Oh, Chuck, you're an animal.</i>

01:26:09.632 --> 01:26:12.199
-<i> You're an animal!</i>
          -<i> Ha-ha-ha!</i>

01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:14.501
<i> In other news, after</i>
 <i> a grueling month-long search</i>

01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:18.472
<i> the bagger murderer,</i>
     <i> suspected of killing</i>
<i>local yoga teacher, Cheryl Hoad</i>

01:26:18.474 --> 01:26:20.707
<i> is finally in custody.</i>

01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:24.878
<i> The suspect,</i>
   <i> Little Helen Frownfelter,</i>
  <i> was apprehended moments ago</i>

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:28.182
<i>in the home of recent divorcee,</i>
         <i> Jill Davies.</i>

01:26:29.852 --> 01:26:32.519
<i> Little Helen has confessed</i>
    <i> to accidentally backing</i>

01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:36.957
<i> Cheryl Hoad down a staircase,</i>
  <i> causing her untimely death.</i>

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:47.234
<i> You know, it's funny Cheryl</i>
   <i> was the one to die early.</i>

01:26:47.236 --> 01:26:50.637
She was never early
for anything. I'm always early.

01:26:50.639 --> 01:26:53.740
I was born two months early.
        I was so skinny.

01:26:53.742 --> 01:26:55.809
[chuckles]

01:26:55.811 --> 01:26:57.244
Really skinny.

01:26:58.714 --> 01:27:00.414
The skinniest baby.

01:27:02.618 --> 01:27:04.751
[sighs]

01:27:04.753 --> 01:27:07.387
The whereabouts of Ms. Davies
        remain unknown.

01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:09.656
However, Little Helen claims

01:27:09.658 --> 01:27:12.426
that Ms. Davies sped off
       in her golf cart.

01:27:12.428 --> 01:27:15.229
Little Helen's story has been
corroborated by three neighbors

01:27:15.231 --> 01:27:19.399
who witnessed Ms. Davies
 being rude at a four-way stop.

01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:22.636
<i> And now,</i>
  <i> Haven Nutt is on the scene.</i>

01:27:22.638 --> 01:27:24.137
Thanks, dad.

01:27:24.139 --> 01:27:25.272
[grunting]

01:27:25.274 --> 01:27:26.506
I'm standing here with the woman

01:27:26.508 --> 01:27:28.609
who discovered
      the bagger murderer.

01:27:28.611 --> 01:27:31.645
Lisa Wheatbottom. Uh --

01:27:31.647 --> 01:27:33.914
Oh, no, it's Wetbottom.

01:27:33.916 --> 01:27:36.149
I did discover
      the bagger murderer.

01:27:36.151 --> 01:27:37.451
I went over to talk to Jill

01:27:37.453 --> 01:27:39.553
and that strange woman
       answered the door.

01:27:39.555 --> 01:27:41.355
I recognized her
       'cause she taught

01:27:41.357 --> 01:27:43.991
the longest yoga class
       I've ever been in.

01:27:43.993 --> 01:27:46.493
Ah. I've always wanted
          to do yoga.

01:27:46.495 --> 01:27:48.428
- You should, it's really easy.
             - Hm.

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.597
Anyway, I was like,
        "Where is Jill?"

01:27:50.599 --> 01:27:52.566
And Little Helen was like,
          "I am Jill."

01:27:52.568 --> 01:27:54.935
And then started screaming
   at me that I had to leave

01:27:54.937 --> 01:27:56.570
'cause her kids are in bed.

01:27:56.572 --> 01:27:59.273
And, obviously,
     I knew it wasn't Jill.

01:27:59.275 --> 01:28:01.842
Jill doesn't have kids anymore.

01:28:01.844 --> 01:28:06.013
So I went to the police
    and now I'm on the news.

01:28:08.150 --> 01:28:09.816
I'm on the news, too.

01:28:12.354 --> 01:28:15.122
<i> Ma'am? Ma'am?</i>

01:28:15.124 --> 01:28:16.490
Ma'am?

01:28:16.492 --> 01:28:17.658
Oh.

01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:21.261
No, no, you can call me mommy.

01:28:21.263 --> 01:28:24.531
Okay, yeah,
 I have to go to the bathroom.

01:28:24.533 --> 01:28:25.532
[sighs]

01:28:27.603 --> 01:28:30.203
Thank you for telling me.

01:28:30.205 --> 01:28:31.204
[chuckles]

01:28:33.942 --> 01:28:35.242
Come on.

01:28:35.244 --> 01:28:37.411
[Jill laughing]

01:28:39.682 --> 01:28:42.683
[indistinct yelling]

01:28:47.056 --> 01:28:49.823
[tires screeching]

01:28:50.392 --> 01:28:51.792
Jill?

01:28:51.794 --> 01:28:53.560
Oh, my God!

01:28:54.029 --> 01:28:55.529
Yeesh.

01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:58.532
[instrumental music]

01:29:02.538 --> 01:29:05.539
[indistinct yelling]

01:29:07.009 --> 01:29:09.810
I'm so glad you're okay.

01:29:09.812 --> 01:29:12.079
I felt so bad
   after you left yesterday.

01:29:12.081 --> 01:29:13.747
That's why I went over
         to your house.

01:29:13.749 --> 01:29:16.583
- Yeah, I saw on the news.
   - You saw me on the news?

01:29:16.585 --> 01:29:18.085
- Mm-hmm.
            - Cool.

01:29:18.087 --> 01:29:20.053
Hm.

01:29:20.055 --> 01:29:23.590
So I've been thinking a lot
 about what you keep asking me

01:29:23.592 --> 01:29:26.093
and I've changed my mind.

01:29:26.095 --> 01:29:29.262
Oh, my God, Lisa,
 you're giving me my baby back?

01:29:29.264 --> 01:29:31.431
Oh. No.

01:29:31.433 --> 01:29:33.333
You can have Bob.

01:29:33.335 --> 01:29:35.802
You stupid, hideous net!

01:29:37.973 --> 01:29:39.506
That's okay, Lisa.

01:29:39.508 --> 01:29:40.907
[chuckles]

01:29:40.909 --> 01:29:43.910
[instrumental music]

01:30:02.931 --> 01:30:05.932
[indistinct chatter]

01:30:09.972 --> 01:30:12.172
She's so cute, Jill.

01:30:12.174 --> 01:30:13.673
I love her.

01:30:13.675 --> 01:30:15.675
[intense music]

01:30:17.446 --> 01:30:19.780
Why don't you guys come over
        later and swim?

01:30:19.782 --> 01:30:22.916
- You don't have a pool.
        - Oh, I do now.

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:24.317
I was at your house last night

01:30:24.319 --> 01:30:27.053
after the cops took
    the bagger murderer away

01:30:27.055 --> 01:30:32.159
and I was looking around
         and I thought

01:30:32.161 --> 01:30:35.162
I would actually be
       much happier here.

01:30:35.164 --> 01:30:37.063
So I called Dennis

01:30:37.065 --> 01:30:40.333
and he came over with the kids
         and our stuff.

01:30:40.335 --> 01:30:43.370
So, yeah,
   we live in your house now.

01:30:43.372 --> 01:30:45.872
Thanks, Jill.
   I actually have a question
     about the thermostat.

01:30:45.874 --> 01:30:47.474
You live in my house?

01:30:47.476 --> 01:30:50.043
I don't think
Nick's gonna be okay with that.

01:30:50.045 --> 01:30:52.145
He knows. He lives there, too.

01:30:52.147 --> 01:30:55.649
- Nick lives with you?
   - Yeah, he's our pool boy.

01:30:55.651 --> 01:30:58.185
- Well, pool man.
            - What?

01:30:58.187 --> 01:31:01.188
Oh, Jill, obviously,
     you can have my house.

01:31:01.190 --> 01:31:03.690
Haven't you always loved
      my plush carpeting?

01:31:04.426 --> 01:31:06.893
Well...yeah.

01:31:07.763 --> 01:31:09.162
It's yours now.

01:31:10.933 --> 01:31:12.199
Thank you.

01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:16.269

01:31:22.644 --> 01:31:25.645
[intense music]

01:31:38.727 --> 01:31:40.827
Hey, Lisa?

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:43.497
Do the children play soccer
           on graves?

01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:45.966
Yeah.

01:31:47.069 --> 01:31:49.269
I never noticed that before.

01:31:50.038 --> 01:31:51.538
[yelling]

01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:52.572

01:32:14.696 --> 01:32:17.364
[grunting]

01:32:17.366 --> 01:32:19.165
<i> Jill, where are you going?</i>

01:32:19.167 --> 01:32:21.668
I think, I think
   I have to get out of here.

01:32:23.472 --> 01:32:24.871
I have to get out of here!

01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:26.273
[whistle blows]

01:32:26.275 --> 01:32:27.774
Out of bounds.

01:32:28.810 --> 01:32:31.811
[breathing heavily]
