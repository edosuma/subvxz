My name is Ava Robbins,

00:26.484 --> 00:29.623
and I am making this video, you know,

00:29.623 --> 00:31.094
to look back on one day

00:31.094 --> 00:33.185

00:33.185 --> 00:36.645

00:36.645 --> 00:39.615
Three years ago, my parents passed away,

00:39.615 --> 00:43.041
and, if I'm honest,
it's not getting easier,

00:43.041 --> 00:46.036
so I've decided it's time
I take control of my life.

00:46.036 --> 00:50.267
I used up all the money I had
and I bought a van, a Westy,

00:50.267 --> 00:54.408
and I'm gonna pack it up and
travel the United States.

02:08.340 --> 02:10.380
We haven't seen any content from you

02:10.380 --> 02:12.124

Hey, can you hear me?

03:39.733 --> 03:42.234
(Ava screams)

03:47.957 --> 03:51.767
Hey, guys, I know I've been
MIA the last couple months,

03:51.767 --> 03:54.828
and you guys have no idea
how much I've missed you.

03:54.828 --> 03:57.108
I know you've been worried
and leaving comments,

03:57.108 --> 03:59.028
but I'm back.

03:59.028 --> 04:00.409
You know how I've always wanted to

04:00.409 --> 04:01.879
buy a little cabin in the woods?

04:01.879 --> 04:04.009
Well, I actually did it.

04:04.009 --> 04:06.560
I pulled the trigger and
bought this little place.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.450
I really believe in listening to

04:08.450 --> 04:10.010
the signs from the universe,

04:10.010 --> 04:12.381
and some signs are more
convincing than others.

04:12.381 --> 04:14.391
I had a little fender bender.

04:14.391 --> 04:16.851
Let's say the deer got
away to live another day.

04:16.851 --> 04:20.842
My van, not so much,
neither did my forehead,

04:20.842 --> 04:24.773
and here comes my new fairy godmother.

04:24.773 --> 04:27.143
What do you have to tell
the good people, Dottie?

04:27.143 --> 04:29.468
She's all yours.

04:29.468 --> 04:32.394
Thank you so much for everything.

04:32.394 --> 04:34.374
Let me know if you need anything else.

04:34.374 --> 04:37.708
And here comes my knight
in shining skinny jeans.

04:38.544 --> 04:40.885
(truck horn beeps)

04:40.885 --> 04:43.436
Kellen found my ass broken
down on the side of the road

04:43.436 --> 04:45.266
after I hit that deer.

04:45.266 --> 04:47.817
He's been amazing these
last couple of months,

04:47.817 --> 04:51.147
helping me recuperate,
helping me settle in.

04:51.147 --> 04:55.021
I couldn't ask for a better friend.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.398
You're gonna get so many
likes from this video.

04:59.398 --> 05:00.299
Do you know that?

05:00.299 --> 05:02.579
All for little ole me, huh?

05:02.579 --> 05:05.519
I told you guys the
scenery was nice out here.

05:05.519 --> 05:08.883
Okay. Let's go to the house.

05:09.720 --> 05:12.454
This is the bedroom. It's quaint.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.801
Look at all the great
stuff this place came with.

05:16.801 --> 05:18.275
So much potential.

05:19.262 --> 05:20.762
So many projects coming soon.

05:20.762 --> 05:21.595
Oh!

05:24.363 --> 05:27.956
Like fixing the floorboards
before I break my neck.

05:27.956 --> 05:30.424
Hey.

05:30.424 --> 05:32.684
I put the van in the shed.

05:32.684 --> 05:35.267
(gentle music)

05:43.172 --> 05:45.999
All right. Let me know if
you need anything else.

06:13.892 --> 06:17.475

06:19.682 --> 06:22.392
This really feels like a fresh start,

06:22.392 --> 06:25.576
a place I can finally call home.

06:26.893 --> 06:31.034
I haven't had that
since I lost my parents,

06:31.034 --> 06:33.494
but you guys are all family to me now,

06:33.494 --> 06:36.195
and I wanna thank you guys so much.

06:36.195 --> 06:40.364
I can't believe I just
hit 600,000 subscribers.

06:40.364 --> 06:43.396
I remember when I used
to get excited about

06:43.396 --> 06:45.676
10 likes on a new video.

06:45.676 --> 06:48.677
So, I'm no longer Van Girl.

06:48.677 --> 06:50.660
Call me Cabin Girl.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.387
And I'm just so grateful

06:53.387 --> 06:56.298
you guys have been there
every step of the way,

06:56.298 --> 06:57.629

06:59.178 --> 07:02.059

08:12.001 --> 08:13.442
Now, coffee.

08:14.761 --> 08:17.041
Okay, so, finally, I can sleep at night.

08:17.041 --> 08:18.608
You finally posted.

breathe a sigh of relief.

10:52.617 --> 10:56.728
Ava is back, but it seems
like she is ditching van life,

10:56.728 --> 10:59.786
like many other people in the
van life community right now,

10:59.786 --> 11:03.539
and I didn't expect her
to go that route, so.

11:03.539 --> 11:06.150
I just really fell
in love with this place

11:06.150 --> 11:07.737
while I was recovering,

11:07.737 --> 11:11.554
and, I don't know, it's just
like living in simpler times.

11:12.481 --> 11:14.011
Lookie here.

11:14.011 --> 11:16.803
Hey, stranger. How's cabin life?

11:16.803 --> 11:19.265
Rustic. How's engine life?

11:20.612 --> 11:22.172
It's rusty.

11:22.172 --> 11:24.243
It looks pretty good from over here,

11:24.243 --> 11:27.230
and my ladies out there, he's single.

11:34.426 --> 11:37.475
All right, I'm gonna leave
you and your dimples alone

11:37.475 --> 11:39.485
and go hike on my lonesome.

11:39.485 --> 11:40.529

13:36.235 --> 13:37.426
Hello?

13:37.426 --> 13:39.926
(eerie music)

13:43.526 --> 13:45.299
I have pepper spray!

13:45.299 --> 13:50.300
(ghostly voices indistinctly whispering)

13:50.701 --> 13:53.201
(eerie music)

14:00.564 --> 14:03.897
(eerie music continues)

14:10.285 --> 14:13.619
(eerie music continues)

14:20.204 --> 14:23.538
(eerie music continues)

14:29.866 --> 14:31.616
Do you guys see that?

14:33.523 --> 14:34.606
What is that?

14:36.523 --> 14:39.098
(engine roars)

14:39.098 --> 14:40.221
(Ava screams)

14:40.221 --> 14:42.067
(tires squeal)

14:42.067 --> 14:44.567
(eerie music)

14:52.129 --> 14:54.241
(eerie music continues)

14:54.241 --> 14:57.218
What do you guys think happened to her?

14:57.218 --> 14:58.268
She jumped.

14:59.259 --> 15:00.759
Oh, you scared me.

15:00.759 --> 15:02.439
She tied a cinder block around her waist

15:02.439 --> 15:03.972
and she dove in headfirst.

15:04.899 --> 15:06.463
God. Why?

15:07.960 --> 15:10.367
Wanted to make it stick, I guess.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.951
(somber music)

15:16.211 --> 15:17.472
Ava.

15:17.472 --> 15:21.037
Trina. I'm guessing
you're the internet girl.

15:21.037 --> 15:23.413
Wow. Word travels fast around here.

15:23.413 --> 15:25.573
I mean, it is a small town.

15:25.573 --> 15:28.423
There are no secrets. Just gossip.

15:28.423 --> 15:30.074
Thanks for the heads up.

15:30.074 --> 15:32.204
Well, I own the best bar in town.

15:32.204 --> 15:34.904
It is the only bar, the Mystic Fox.

15:34.904 --> 15:37.580
You should pop in sometime for a drink.

15:37.580 --> 15:40.717
(Ava screams)

15:40.717 --> 15:41.956
Hey, are you okay?

15:41.956 --> 15:45.769
Yeah, yeah, I just need to sit down.

15:47.982 --> 15:50.061
(idyllic country music)

15:50.061 --> 15:54.168
(country singer indistinctly singing)

15:54.168 --> 15:57.468
Just take it easy.
The internet can wait.

15:57.468 --> 16:00.723
It can't. My subscribers
are everything to me.

16:00.723 --> 16:02.608
I can't let 'em down.

16:02.608 --> 16:05.300
That sounds fulfilling.

16:05.300 --> 16:09.050
I'm lucky. I didn't have
much going on before this.

16:09.050 --> 16:10.800
Now I have a real sense of purpose.

16:12.158 --> 16:13.741
Thanks for the ride.

16:13.741 --> 16:17.242
(country singer indistinctly singing)

16:17.242 --> 16:18.075
Oh, shit.

16:19.425 --> 16:22.582
(solemn music)

16:22.582 --> 16:23.416
What?

16:23.416 --> 16:26.423
I didn't know this place was for sale.

16:26.423 --> 16:27.473
Why wouldn't it be?

16:30.114 --> 16:32.574
This is where Hannah
Granger used to live.

16:32.574 --> 16:34.024
What are the chances of that?

16:35.124 --> 16:37.795
Hey, guys, so, you know,
I went on a hike today,

16:37.795 --> 16:40.673
tried to explore my new grounds,

16:40.673 --> 16:45.674
and I came across this
really haunting memorial

16:45.929 --> 16:49.287
that had been defaced.

16:49.287 --> 16:50.247
Turns out it belongs to

16:50.247 --> 16:52.287
this young woman named Hannah Granger,

16:52.287 --> 16:55.558
who actually jumped to her
death on this bridge right here.

16:55.558 --> 16:57.538
I just can't imagine

16:57.538 --> 16:59.999
the amount of pain you
need to be in to do that,

16:59.999 --> 17:02.189
and so I wish her peace
and love wherever she is.

17:02.189 --> 17:05.460
You know I don't believe in coincidences,

17:05.460 --> 17:09.000
but, at the time of her death,
she was living in my cabin.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.881
I don't know if it's a sign or an omen,

17:11.881 --> 17:14.281
but I'm really glad you guys are here

17:14.281 --> 17:16.370
to figure it out with me.

17:16.370 --> 17:18.954
(solemn music)

17:24.009 --> 17:27.009
(crickets chirping)

17:28.563 --> 17:29.434
A lot of you guys

17:29.434 --> 17:32.164
have had questions
since I've been offline,

17:32.164 --> 17:35.978
so I thought we could do a
little cozy Q and A session.

17:37.625 --> 17:41.503
Okay. This is one I've been getting a lot.

17:41.503 --> 17:43.653
"When will you get back on the road?"

17:45.306 --> 17:47.016
Probably not soon.

17:47.016 --> 17:49.027
The doc said it's at least three months

17:49.027 --> 17:50.287
until I can drive again,

17:50.287 --> 17:54.188
and, honestly, I think
I might need longer.

17:54.188 --> 17:55.838
You know, I'm just not in a rush,

17:55.838 --> 18:00.839
and I just know I can bring a
good, new energy to this place

18:01.179 --> 18:04.749
and I wanna share my
experiences with you guys

18:04.749 --> 18:07.753
and I want you guys to
send me positive vibes.

18:10.162 --> 18:13.031
Okay, hold on. We're having
trouble with the internet.

18:13.031 --> 18:15.044
Okay. There we go.

18:16.153 --> 18:18.342
(books creak)

18:18.342 --> 18:21.575
Did you guys see that?
(ominous music)

18:28.170 --> 18:30.323
(ominous music continues)

18:30.323 --> 18:31.406
(Ava gasps)
(mouse squeaks)

18:31.406 --> 18:32.804
Aw!

18:32.804 --> 18:34.394
Did you miss me?

18:34.394 --> 18:35.685
Okay, come here. Nope.

18:35.685 --> 18:38.535
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no. In you go.

18:38.535 --> 18:39.585
I would like it

18:39.585 --> 18:43.249
if you found a home of
your own, little ghost.

18:48.167 --> 18:52.067
Mystery solved, but my
heart is still racing,

18:52.067 --> 18:55.843
so I think maybe that's
where we call it a night.

18:55.843 --> 18:56.801
Mhm.

18:56.801 --> 18:57.799
Mwah!

18:57.799 --> 19:00.717
(foreboding music)

19:02.395 --> 19:05.396
(crickets chirping)

19:12.171 --> 19:15.921
(foreboding music continues)

19:22.532 --> 19:25.200
(ominous music)

19:32.493 --> 19:35.737
(ominous music continues)

19:35.737 --> 19:38.570
(wood clattering)

19:45.716 --> 19:48.340
(ominous music continues)

19:48.340 --> 19:49.519
Ava.

19:49.519 --> 19:52.686
(alarm clock beeping)

19:54.325 --> 19:59.326
(birds chirping)
(gentle music)

20:05.475 --> 20:08.109

20:08.109 --> 20:12.160
♪ A million years have passed ♪

20:12.160 --> 20:16.714
♪ Since I held you last ♪

20:16.714 --> 20:21.715

20:25.184 --> 20:30.034

20:30.034 --> 20:33.262
It really is magical. One of a kind.

20:33.262 --> 20:34.657
You're gonna love it there.

20:35.555 --> 20:36.998
I gotta run. Bye.

20:37.985 --> 20:38.818
Hello.

20:41.586 --> 20:43.886
I was hoping you could
help me with a cabin.

20:45.822 --> 20:50.377
What have you sold recently?
Any small fixer-uppers?

20:50.377 --> 20:53.168
If I saw some of those properties,

20:53.168 --> 20:56.624
maybe I'd get a better
sense of the marketplace.

20:56.624 --> 20:59.542
(foreboding music)

21:06.194 --> 21:09.944
(foreboding music continues)

(car horn honking)

22:26.004 --> 22:30.172
(rock music indistinctly playing)

22:33.990 --> 22:36.562
Hey there. Can I give
you a ride somewhere?

22:36.562 --> 22:37.825
No, no, it's okay.

22:37.825 --> 22:41.069
I'm enjoying riding a bike,
and, you know, the quiet.

22:42.164 --> 22:43.706
Well, it's a ways into town.

22:43.706 --> 22:45.779
I'm vlogging, and, you know, I'm good.

22:47.187 --> 22:48.922
Just stop by the shop, okay?

22:48.922 --> 22:50.757
Your rear tire's looking a little flat.

22:50.757 --> 22:52.167
I can pump it up for you.

22:52.167 --> 22:54.241
I'm sure you can.

22:54.241 --> 22:57.088
(Kellen chuckles)

22:57.088 --> 22:58.409
All right. I'll see you.

22:58.409 --> 22:59.368
See you.

22:59.368 --> 23:03.535
(rock music indistinctly playing)

23:07.580 --> 23:11.914
(gentle music indistinctly playing)

23:13.064 --> 23:15.421
Hey. How'd that varnish work out?

23:15.421 --> 23:17.222
Great. Best ever.

23:17.222 --> 23:18.932
Now I need a new latch for my shed.

23:18.932 --> 23:21.035
Oh, yeah, let's see. Yep.

23:24.003 --> 23:24.853
Let's call it 30.

23:27.513 --> 23:29.194
Good morning, sheriff.

23:29.194 --> 23:30.814
Popcorn machine working?

23:30.814 --> 23:32.374
Triple butter, just the way you like it.

23:32.374 --> 23:35.855
Oh, son, you never disappoint.

23:35.855 --> 23:36.688
Ma'am.

23:38.195 --> 23:39.831
Always a pleasure, miss.

23:39.831 --> 23:42.415
(gentle music)

23:49.787 --> 23:52.851
(gentle music continues)

23:52.851 --> 23:54.665
(Ava sighs)

23:54.665 --> 23:59.666
(bike pump whirring)
(rock music playing)

24:02.534 --> 24:04.254
All right.

24:04.254 --> 24:06.040
Well, you might have a slow leak,

24:06.040 --> 24:07.000
but I can order a new tire.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.582
It'll probably get here
in a couple of days.

24:08.582 --> 24:11.180
Oh, yeah, that's great. Yeah.

24:11.180 --> 24:13.688
Well, thank you.

24:13.688 --> 24:15.491
You sure you don't want that ride?

24:15.491 --> 24:16.933
I'm good.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.172
(eerie music)

24:18.172 --> 24:19.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:20.060 --> 24:20.893
Are you all right?

24:20.893 --> 24:24.049
Yeah, yeah. I'll take that ride.

24:24.049 --> 24:25.382
Cool. Come on.

24:27.858 --> 24:31.442
(thunder faintly rumbling)

24:31.442 --> 24:34.359
(foreboding music)

24:41.827 --> 24:44.646
(foreboding music continues)

24:44.646 --> 24:47.480
(engine rumbling)

24:54.137 --> 24:57.887
(foreboding music continues)

25:04.464 --> 25:08.215
(foreboding music continues)

25:14.348 --> 25:17.099
(birds chirping)

25:18.259 --> 25:21.676
(Ava and Kellen chuckle)

25:22.689 --> 25:25.223
How do you like living out
here in the middle of nowhere?

25:25.223 --> 25:28.136
It's not nowhere. It's here.

25:29.713 --> 25:30.987
I like the solitude.

25:33.354 --> 25:34.187
Yeah, I bet.

25:34.187 --> 25:35.021
Being a big internet star,

25:35.021 --> 25:37.192
you probably get all kinds of
weirdos bothering you, right?

25:37.192 --> 25:38.025
Mhm.

25:39.385 --> 25:41.636
There was one guy who kept coming to

25:41.636 --> 25:43.636
my meet and greets all over the country.

25:44.523 --> 25:47.524
I woke up to him trying to break
into my van with handcuffs.

25:49.839 --> 25:52.667
What did you do?

25:52.667 --> 25:53.938
It was a nightmare.

25:53.938 --> 25:56.341
The police got involved
and it was just a mess.

25:57.777 --> 26:00.278
(drill whirs)

26:04.199 --> 26:06.363
You ever hear of Hannah Granger?

26:07.740 --> 26:09.390
Sure. Everyone around here has.

26:11.474 --> 26:12.674
She lived in my cabin.

26:14.401 --> 26:15.691
No way.

26:15.691 --> 26:16.524
Yep.

26:17.702 --> 26:20.315
So, what's her story?

26:23.403 --> 26:24.603
You really wanna know?

26:25.833 --> 26:26.666
Yeah.

26:30.904 --> 26:32.227
This is beautiful.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.965
Beats the Walmart parking lot, huh?

26:36.875 --> 26:40.716
That's my line. Are you
sure you're not a subscriber?

26:40.716 --> 26:44.196
So they say Hannah was an actual witch,

26:44.196 --> 26:46.056
and after she jumped from this bridge,

26:46.056 --> 26:48.367
everyone started calling
it Suicide Bridge,

26:48.367 --> 26:50.287
and if you stand too close to the edge,

26:50.287 --> 26:51.907
Hannah's ghost will push you off.

26:51.907 --> 26:53.502
Yikes.

26:53.502 --> 26:56.780
Or, worse, possess
your soul for eternity.

26:56.780 --> 26:59.409
Aw. Sounds like wholesome fun.

26:59.409 --> 27:00.709
It was scary as hell

27:02.616 --> 27:04.900
This one time, some kid really flipped out

27:04.900 --> 27:06.880
'cause he thought he saw a ghost.

27:06.880 --> 27:10.208
Almost fell in. Kind
of stopped after that.

27:10.208 --> 27:12.876
(ominous music)

27:20.297 --> 27:23.798
(ominous music continues)

27:26.143 --> 27:28.977
(engine rumbling)

27:30.146 --> 27:32.396
(cow moos)

27:40.106 --> 27:45.107
(birds chirping)
(gentle music)

27:49.157 --> 27:51.020
Are you lost?

27:51.020 --> 27:53.604
(gentle music)

28:01.043 --> 28:03.876
(camera clicking)

28:08.128 --> 28:10.629
(eerie music)

28:12.708 --> 28:15.291
(tires squeal)

28:18.002 --> 28:19.782
(phone clicks)

28:19.782 --> 28:21.502
Hi. Is this the sheriff?

28:21.502 --> 28:23.903
Someone's cow got loose
and ended up in my yard.

28:28.174 --> 28:29.008
Shit.

28:32.008 --> 28:34.341
(Ava sighs)

28:35.722 --> 28:38.305
(solemn music)

28:43.892 --> 28:48.357
(lively radio music playing)

28:48.357 --> 28:52.020
Hey, guys. I thought I'd give
you guys a little update.

28:52.978 --> 28:57.568
Cabin life has been very peaceful.

28:57.568 --> 28:59.759
Kellen came over today to fix my latch,

28:59.759 --> 29:02.009
and don't get any dirty ideas.

29:02.009 --> 29:05.278
He actually fixed the latch on my shed.

29:05.278 --> 29:06.840
(Kellen chuckles)

29:06.840 --> 29:09.003
But he gave me the scoop on Hannah,

29:09.870 --> 29:14.871
and she was into witchcraft or a Wiccan.

29:15.331 --> 29:19.085
I just wish I knew what she
was going through, because,

29:21.190 --> 29:22.926
why would she do that?

29:24.963 --> 29:26.433
When I lost my parents,

29:26.433 --> 29:28.564
I still felt like they were around me,

29:28.564 --> 29:32.377
like I could just close my
eyes and they'd be by me,

29:33.934 --> 29:36.845
and I just feel like our energy

29:36.845 --> 29:40.085
has to make an imprint in this world.

29:40.085 --> 29:42.006
I mean, especially after

29:42.006 --> 29:44.156
everything we go through
in life, you know?

29:45.186 --> 29:49.300
So, maybe Hannah spirit's still here,

29:51.007 --> 29:54.398
or maybe I'm getting a little
woo-woo in the woods alone

29:54.398 --> 29:55.388
after all this time.

29:55.388 --> 29:56.221
I don't know.

29:57.548 --> 29:58.539
It's getting a little dark,

29:58.539 --> 30:01.242
so I think I'm gonna go
ahead and call it tonight.

30:01.242 --> 30:02.257
Bye, guys.

30:02.257 --> 30:07.258
(foreboding music)
(crickets chirping)

30:12.308 --> 30:16.058
(foreboding music continues)

30:20.182 --> 30:22.015
Ava.

30:24.192 --> 30:26.692
(eerie music)

30:34.523 --> 30:37.856
(eerie music continues)

30:42.901 --> 30:44.147
You?

30:44.147 --> 30:46.648
(eerie music)

30:52.179 --> 30:55.180
(crickets chirping)

31:00.740 --> 31:03.407
(ominous music)

31:10.265 --> 31:13.486
(ominous music continues)
(book thumps)

31:13.486 --> 31:15.986
(books thump)

31:23.539 --> 31:27.039
(ominous music continues)

31:33.550 --> 31:37.051
(ominous music continues)

31:43.352 --> 31:48.353
(crickets chirping)
(solemn music)

31:53.449 --> 31:56.866
(solemn music continues)

32:03.527 --> 32:06.945
(solemn music continues)

32:10.969 --> 32:13.331
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

32:13.331 --> 32:16.556
It's fine. I was just resting my eyes.

32:16.556 --> 32:19.160
I got that call about the cow.

32:19.160 --> 32:20.255
Did you find it?

32:21.362 --> 32:24.183
Sure did. I had to put her down.

32:24.183 --> 32:25.140
What? Why?

32:25.140 --> 32:27.783
Oh, well, the coyotes got to her.

32:27.783 --> 32:29.348
Tore her near to pieces.

32:29.348 --> 32:30.964
(tires squeal)

32:30.964 --> 32:32.554
She was still breathing.
(eerie music)

32:32.554 --> 32:36.818
Unfortunately, that's what
can happen around here.

32:37.835 --> 32:40.536
You're new here, right?

32:40.536 --> 32:41.936
Welcome to the neighborhood.

32:43.512 --> 32:46.450
If you see any more of
'em, give us a call.

32:47.527 --> 32:50.900
Have a nice day.
(solemn music)

32:52.102 --> 32:55.688
Like, I know I was glad
that you were back, Ava,

32:55.688 --> 32:57.848
and, like, I'm sorry
if you're seeing this,

32:57.848 --> 33:01.749
'cause I was, like, your
most loyal follower and fan,

33:01.749 --> 33:04.179
but, like, I really miss the old Ava.

33:04.179 --> 33:05.560
Like, I don't know who this is.

33:05.560 --> 33:06.580
I don't know where she's gone,

33:06.580 --> 33:09.250
but, please, please, old Ava, come back,

33:09.250 --> 33:12.700
because this is just some weird shit.

33:12.700 --> 33:16.181
Like, who actually believes
in all this ghost crap?

33:16.181 --> 33:17.015
Hey, everyone.

33:17.015 --> 33:19.332
I just wanted to say I'm
so glad that Ava is back.

33:19.332 --> 33:21.942
She's alive and well. That's
the only thing that matters.

33:21.942 --> 33:25.003
Her last video, though,
a little bit sketch.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.983
Not gonna comment on
that now, though, because

33:26.983 --> 33:28.093
I'm gonna go hit the road.
Oh, shit.

33:28.093 --> 33:30.434
Don't forget to like
and subscribe to Van Doll.

33:30.434 --> 33:31.634
How are the headaches?

33:32.594 --> 33:34.017
Pretty bad.

33:34.017 --> 33:35.508
What about vision?

33:38.295 --> 33:42.656
Well, I'm having visions.

33:43.857 --> 33:45.616
(ghost gasps)

33:45.616 --> 33:46.967
Well, okay.

33:46.967 --> 33:51.752
Hallucinations are not that
uncommon after a head injury.

33:51.752 --> 33:54.328
Ava, it's very important to remember that

33:56.208 --> 34:00.082
these moments and
experiences are not real.

34:01.129 --> 34:03.952
A few deep breaths and they will pass.

34:05.300 --> 34:08.513
A few nights of good rest
should really make a difference.

34:09.558 --> 34:12.142
(solemn music)

34:20.801 --> 34:25.219
(country music indistinctly playing)

34:29.934 --> 34:33.774
Hey, Ava. Welcome,
and what will you have?

34:33.774 --> 34:37.025
A cold beer and the wifi password.

34:37.025 --> 34:38.605
"Fuckrightoff."

34:38.605 --> 34:40.075
Excuse me?

34:40.075 --> 34:41.376
Oh, that's the password.

34:43.316 --> 34:44.756
All lowercase.

34:44.756 --> 34:45.589
Got it.

34:52.786 --> 34:55.453
(ominous music)

35:02.782 --> 35:05.430
(ominous music continues)

35:05.430 --> 35:07.440
Can I ask you a question?

35:07.440 --> 35:08.280
Shoot.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.581
Is this how you spell
Hannah Granger's name?

35:11.611 --> 35:12.444
Oh, honey,

35:12.444 --> 35:14.344
you're not gonna find
anything online about her.

35:14.344 --> 35:16.032
Look where you are.

35:16.032 --> 35:18.005
No one in this town is blogging.

35:19.532 --> 35:20.365
Great.

35:20.365 --> 35:22.803
I just wanna find a little history

35:22.803 --> 35:25.596
about the place I sunk
all my life savings into.

35:26.629 --> 35:29.404
I might be able to help.

35:29.404 --> 35:32.317
My dad was a hoarder,
so we might get lucky.

35:33.274 --> 35:34.107
Come with me.

35:38.555 --> 35:39.388
Happy hunting.

35:43.176 --> 35:44.346
Take whatever you want.

35:44.346 --> 35:45.179
Thank you.

35:54.329 --> 35:56.912
(somber music)

36:04.439 --> 36:06.227
(somber music continues)

36:06.227 --> 36:07.510
"Elijah Granger has been

36:07.510 --> 36:10.027
declared a suspect in his sister's death."

36:12.018 --> 36:14.651
"Elijah Granger has been
declared mentally unfit

36:14.651 --> 36:16.839
after also attempting to kill himself."

36:22.099 --> 36:24.703
"Committed to Brassard Institution.

36:24.703 --> 36:25.903
Little hope of recovery

36:25.903 --> 36:29.571
due to brain damage suffered
in the suicide attempt."

36:29.571 --> 36:32.861
"Hannah Granger's death
officially ruled suicide."

36:33.874 --> 36:36.458
(somber music)

36:43.394 --> 36:45.316
(country music indistinctly playing)

36:45.316 --> 36:47.117
Did you find what you need?

36:47.117 --> 36:48.740
More questions than answers.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.950
Why do you think Hannah jumped?

36:52.998 --> 36:54.408
I'm not sure she did.

36:54.408 --> 36:55.818
Back in the 1600s,

36:55.818 --> 36:58.819
they would push accused
witches off a high cliff,

36:58.819 --> 37:02.179
because, if she was a
witch, she'd fly away.

37:02.179 --> 37:03.859
You think she was pushed?

37:03.859 --> 37:05.630
I wouldn't rule it out.

37:05.630 --> 37:09.435
The Grangers were a
powerful, wealthy family,

37:09.435 --> 37:11.934
and you know money can
always buy innocence.

37:13.085 --> 37:15.385
Then why was she living
in my old-ass cabin?

37:16.252 --> 37:18.022
Oh, they disowned her.

37:18.022 --> 37:20.005
She just wound up there, I guess.

37:23.573 --> 37:25.373
You know, I had a dream about her,

37:26.903 --> 37:29.457
and I can't get it out of my head.

37:32.664 --> 37:35.015
Do you think she's trying
to tell me something?

37:36.400 --> 37:40.818
(country music indistinctly playing)

37:43.646 --> 37:45.489
You gotta be kidding.

37:45.489 --> 37:48.270
Unless you know a way to DM a dead girl.

37:49.815 --> 37:50.880
Eh, worth a shot.

37:51.897 --> 37:54.391
You know not to use that alone, right?

37:55.468 --> 37:56.301
Really?

37:56.301 --> 37:58.229
I'm sure Kellen would
be happy to join you.

37:59.339 --> 38:00.172
Thanks again.

38:00.172 --> 38:01.769
Oh!
Oh, shoot.

38:01.769 --> 38:03.313
I am so sorry.
Oh.

38:03.313 --> 38:04.980
No, no, it's my fault. My fault.

38:04.980 --> 38:06.990
No, no, I was distracted.

38:06.990 --> 38:08.430
Shit.
No, no, it's okay.

38:08.430 --> 38:09.509
No, you don't have to.

38:09.509 --> 38:10.343
No, no, no, no.
No, no.

38:10.343 --> 38:12.688
I hope this wasn't expensive.
Can I pay for dry cleaning?

38:12.688 --> 38:14.431
No, no, no.

38:14.431 --> 38:15.721
Okay.

38:15.721 --> 38:18.335
Well, I'm a mess today, so sorry again.

38:19.502 --> 38:21.542
Meet my new friend, Jody.

38:21.542 --> 38:22.376
Jackie.

38:22.376 --> 38:23.823
It's so amazing to meet you, Ava.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.983
I've been watching your
videos for so long.

38:25.983 --> 38:28.324
You totally inspired me to get my own van

38:28.324 --> 38:29.524
and hit the road.

38:29.524 --> 38:33.087
That calls for a toast! Woo!

38:33.087 --> 38:34.325
I just had a thought

38:34.325 --> 38:37.115
I don't think enough
people are thinking about.

38:37.115 --> 38:41.346
Hannah Granger jumped, or
was pushed from a high spot,

38:41.346 --> 38:42.906
which is exactly how

38:42.906 --> 38:44.616
they used to try witches back in the day,

38:44.616 --> 38:45.606
push you off a cliff,

38:45.606 --> 38:47.767
and if you flew, oh, you're witch,

38:47.767 --> 38:49.987
and if you didn't, oh, our bad.

38:49.987 --> 38:51.160
Try again next time.

38:52.516 --> 38:57.008
I'm gonna go to the cemetery
right now. See what I can see.

38:57.008 --> 38:58.599
See if there's any hints or...

38:59.572 --> 39:02.239
(ominous music)

39:09.836 --> 39:13.337
(ominous music continues)

39:19.862 --> 39:23.363
(ominous music continues)

39:29.382 --> 39:32.882
(ominous music continues)

39:39.339 --> 39:42.840
(ominous music continues)

39:49.307 --> 39:52.808
(ominous music continues)

39:59.359 --> 40:02.859
(ominous music continues)

40:09.135 --> 40:12.636
(ominous music continues)

40:16.895 --> 40:19.895
(suspenseful music)

40:26.635 --> 40:30.469
(suspenseful music continues)

40:32.969 --> 40:34.720
What happened to you?

40:35.940 --> 40:38.523
(solemn music)

40:45.536 --> 40:48.954
(solemn music continues)

40:54.391 --> 40:58.319
Hey, guys. I'm at the cemetery
where Hannah's buried.

40:58.319 --> 41:01.409
I'm starting to wonder what
really happened to her.

41:01.409 --> 41:03.479
It doesn't make any sense.

41:03.479 --> 41:05.902
I mean, who knows?

41:05.902 --> 41:08.463
Maybe I'm gonna solve a murder cover-up.

41:11.554 --> 41:14.137
(door squeaks)

41:21.740 --> 41:26.741
(engine rumbling)
(rock music playing)

41:31.474 --> 41:34.214
Hey, Cabin Girl. I got your new tire.

41:34.214 --> 41:35.738
Oh, thank God.

41:36.905 --> 41:37.738
Or me.

41:37.738 --> 41:38.571
Uh-uh.

41:41.492 --> 41:44.242
(birds chirping)

41:51.386 --> 41:53.521
(engine rumbling)

41:53.521 --> 41:55.471
Haven't you ever seen "The Exorcist"?

41:57.969 --> 41:59.817
Maybe I'm already possessed.

41:59.817 --> 42:03.279
(Kellen chuckles)

42:03.279 --> 42:04.337
I keep seeing her.

42:09.729 --> 42:12.397
(ominous music)

42:19.710 --> 42:23.211
(ominous music continues)

42:29.351 --> 42:32.851
(ominous music continues)

42:39.324 --> 42:42.825
(ominous music continues)

42:49.330 --> 42:53.117
(ominous music continues)

42:53.117 --> 42:56.450
(truck engine rumbling)

43:03.266 --> 43:04.100
Thanks.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.933
Do you have some time to kill?

43:11.419 --> 43:12.252
Sure.

43:17.601 --> 43:19.359
What the hell?

43:19.359 --> 43:20.752
It was probably tweakers.

43:20.752 --> 43:23.447
They like to break into
old sheds and shoot up.

43:23.447 --> 43:26.603
Tweakers and ghosts. Anything
else I need to know about?

43:26.603 --> 43:28.644
You got that price for a
reason. This ain't Beverly Hills.

43:28.644 --> 43:30.492
Here. Let me check.

43:30.492 --> 43:33.159
(ominous music)

43:35.546 --> 43:38.095
Well,

43:38.095 --> 43:39.028
another day.

43:40.053 --> 43:42.720
(ominous music)

43:49.742 --> 43:53.243
(ominous music continues)

44:00.105 --> 44:02.159
Okay. Do you really need to do that?

44:02.159 --> 44:04.383
Yes. It's proof.

44:04.383 --> 44:07.470
I should not have told
you about Hannah Granger.

44:07.470 --> 44:10.591
Look, I know this is a little out there,

44:10.591 --> 44:15.591
but I really feel like she's
trying to tell me something.

44:17.102 --> 44:18.485
I feel it.

44:19.802 --> 44:21.692
Did you know her brother was a suspect?

44:21.692 --> 44:22.893
Hey, but she killed herself, okay?

44:22.893 --> 44:23.913
I don't blame the poor girl.

44:23.913 --> 44:26.096
There's not many other
ways out of this town.

44:28.084 --> 44:29.344
That's a little morbid.

44:29.344 --> 44:30.177
Yeah. well, you're trying to

44:30.177 --> 44:33.227
talk to a dead girl on a Ouija board, so.

44:33.227 --> 44:34.668
So, let's go.

44:35.735 --> 44:36.568
Come on.

44:36.568 --> 44:41.399
You take two fingers and you
place them on the planchette.

44:41.399 --> 44:43.982
(gentle music)

44:45.336 --> 44:47.617
I didn't know this was
gonna be so romantic.

44:47.617 --> 44:48.580
Let's focus.

44:49.987 --> 44:51.430
Close your eyes.

44:53.408 --> 44:55.721
Open your mind and heart.

45:00.946 --> 45:02.029
Are you here?

45:05.710 --> 45:06.733
Hannah Granger?

45:08.140 --> 45:09.643
What do you wanna tell us?

45:10.481 --> 45:12.311
Yeah, I'm gonna need
some more wine for this.

45:12.311 --> 45:14.206
Okay. Box by the sink.

45:14.206 --> 45:15.635
Okay.

45:15.635 --> 45:20.636
(foreboding music)
(Ava sighs)

45:21.344 --> 45:24.678
Hannah, can you please give me a sign?

45:26.318 --> 45:28.514
(eerie music)

45:28.514 --> 45:29.347
Hello?

45:30.607 --> 45:32.534
You're kidding.

45:32.534 --> 45:33.828
I'm not doing this.

45:34.875 --> 45:35.708
G.

45:39.766 --> 45:40.599
U.

45:41.874 --> 45:43.556
Yeah, okay.

45:43.556 --> 45:44.389
I.

45:45.699 --> 45:46.937
L.
Ava, you're moving-

45:46.937 --> 45:47.810
I'm not!

45:50.567 --> 45:51.400
T.

45:57.139 --> 45:57.973
Y.

45:59.732 --> 46:00.712
"Guilty." Okay.

46:00.712 --> 46:01.879
Ava, don't bullshit me.

46:01.879 --> 46:04.269
Hannah, who is guilty?

46:04.269 --> 46:06.680
Who tried to kill you, Hannah?

46:06.680 --> 46:09.981
Hannah? Hannah, who's guilty?

46:09.981 --> 46:11.484
Who pushed you off the bridge?

46:13.782 --> 46:14.865
Hannah?

46:14.865 --> 46:17.366
(tense music)

46:20.360 --> 46:21.621
(Ava grunts)

46:21.621 --> 46:22.455
God damn it.

46:22.455 --> 46:23.363
Hey. Okay, relax.

46:23.363 --> 46:25.913
You are taking this
shit way too seriously.

46:25.913 --> 46:27.213
She didn't kill herself.

46:28.824 --> 46:30.657
Somebody killed her.

46:31.884 --> 46:35.335
Maybe you should take a break
from this place for a while.

46:35.335 --> 46:36.971
You know, just go back.

46:36.971 --> 46:37.948
To where?

46:40.346 --> 46:41.519
I've lost my parents.

46:43.766 --> 46:45.461
This is my home now.

46:45.461 --> 46:48.045
(gentle music)

46:55.510 --> 46:58.928
(gentle music continues)

47:03.556 --> 47:05.403
At least that's healing nicely.

47:07.350 --> 47:08.183
You had me worried there.

47:08.183 --> 47:10.866
You're the only person I know
that could drive 200 miles

47:10.866 --> 47:13.216
with a busted radiator
and one headlight light.

47:14.551 --> 47:16.752
You'd tell me if you
had superpowers, right?

47:22.070 --> 47:24.183
I know I've said this a thousand times,

47:24.183 --> 47:27.306
but thank you again for that night.

47:30.394 --> 47:32.721
Is anything starting
to come back to you?

47:32.721 --> 47:35.288
No. It's all kind of a blur.

47:38.421 --> 47:41.653
I just really think it
happened for a reason.

47:43.744 --> 47:46.980
I got up the road, I got my dream cabin,

47:49.027 --> 47:50.051
and I met you.

47:50.051 --> 47:52.635
(gentle music)

47:59.846 --> 48:03.263
(gentle music continues)

48:06.907 --> 48:07.810
Oh my God!
(eerie music)

48:07.810 --> 48:09.100
What?

48:09.100 --> 48:13.241
There's somebody there.
There's somebody outside.

48:13.241 --> 48:14.231
There's somebody there!

48:14.231 --> 48:17.205
Okay. All right, just stay here.

48:17.205 --> 48:22.206
(ominous music)
(crickets chirping)

48:27.512 --> 48:31.013
(ominous music continues)

48:34.515 --> 48:36.315
Go shoot up somewhere else, asshole!

48:37.599 --> 48:40.267
(ominous music)

48:47.756 --> 48:51.256
(ominous music continues)

48:57.608 --> 49:00.281
(ominous music continues)

49:00.281 --> 49:01.600
(Kellen knocking on door)

49:01.600 --> 49:02.683
Hey, it's me.

49:06.183 --> 49:07.433
It's all clear.

49:08.734 --> 49:10.641
I didn't make that up.

49:10.641 --> 49:13.014
I saw somebody right there. I swear.

49:14.871 --> 49:16.635
You did say you were seeing Hannah.

49:19.732 --> 49:21.432
Here, why don't you just lay down?

49:22.527 --> 49:24.610
Just lay down right here.

49:26.984 --> 49:27.818
Okay.

49:31.521 --> 49:32.367
All right.

49:33.204 --> 49:37.759
Hey, I'm gonna stay here while
you sleep and keep guard.

49:37.759 --> 49:40.343
(gentle music)

49:41.357 --> 49:44.024
No ghost is gonna mess with you.

49:45.680 --> 49:50.680
Okay.
(gentle music)

49:51.615 --> 49:54.994

50:00.933 --> 50:05.934

50:55.529 --> 50:59.030

51:04.307 --> 51:07.974
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

51:09.408 --> 51:10.769
Hey.

51:10.769 --> 51:13.436
Who said you could fix my van?

51:14.341 --> 51:16.299
I was just trying to help you.

51:16.299 --> 51:18.702
Trying to help the poor orphan girl?

51:18.702 --> 51:19.782
No. No.

51:19.782 --> 51:20.615
Oh, poor Ava!

51:20.615 --> 51:21.449
Hey, hey, hey.

51:21.449 --> 51:22.282
She has no one to go back to.

51:22.282 --> 51:24.587
Hey, okay, can you just calm
down for one second, please?

51:24.587 --> 51:25.420
Leave.

51:28.171 --> 51:29.004
Go!

51:29.004 --> 51:30.337
Go!
Okay, okay.

51:31.681 --> 51:34.432
(birds chirping)

51:40.814 --> 51:42.556
(engine rumbling)

51:42.556 --> 51:45.073
(somber music)

51:45.073 --> 51:47.657
(engine roars)

51:51.087 --> 51:53.421
(Ava sighs)

52:00.933 --> 52:04.351
(somber music continues)

52:06.206 --> 52:10.210
(tires squeal)
(wood thumping)

52:10.210 --> 52:13.499
(Ava screams)

52:13.499 --> 52:18.500

(tense music)

52:20.686 --> 52:23.354
(ominous music)

52:30.773 --> 52:34.274

53:00.966 --> 53:04.384
(solemn music continues)

53:11.016 --> 53:14.433
(solemn music continues)

53:16.480 --> 53:19.397
(knocking on door)

53:22.258 --> 53:23.091
Hey.
Hi.

53:23.091 --> 53:24.049
What's going on?

53:24.049 --> 53:25.049
Come here.

53:30.154 --> 53:32.974
I found this under the floorboards.

53:32.974 --> 53:34.655
I think it's her jewelry, and, last night,

53:34.655 --> 53:36.665
she was trying to contact
me using the Ouija board.

53:36.665 --> 53:38.705
She's trying to tell me who killed her.

53:38.705 --> 53:39.936
Okay.
But I need your help.

53:39.936 --> 53:41.739
Okay. Just one thing at a time.

53:42.936 --> 53:43.769
Huh.

53:45.397 --> 53:47.617
This is clear quartz.

53:47.617 --> 53:49.207
It's used as protection.

53:49.207 --> 53:51.358
She knew somebody
was trying to kill her.

53:53.948 --> 53:57.218
And the ring is rosewood,

53:57.218 --> 53:59.368
which can be used as a spell blocker.

53:59.368 --> 54:00.201
Okay.

54:03.940 --> 54:06.290
Now split the deck and
ask her your question.

54:09.551 --> 54:11.174
Who hurt you on the bridge?

54:12.064 --> 54:15.485
All right.
(mysterious music)

54:21.619 --> 54:26.286
The first card pertains to
the subject of your question.

54:29.834 --> 54:30.977
The Princess.

54:31.844 --> 54:33.645
So this card refers to

54:33.645 --> 54:36.615
the dominant individual in the situation,

54:36.615 --> 54:38.058
and it is a young woman.

54:39.466 --> 54:43.549
The next card is gonna pertain
to you, the questioner.

54:48.707 --> 54:49.910
The Devil?

54:51.678 --> 54:52.968
Is that me?

54:52.968 --> 54:57.228
Don't take it too literally.
These cards are symbolic.

54:57.228 --> 54:59.599
Let's move on to the next card.

54:59.599 --> 55:02.242
And what's the lesson to be learned?

55:06.080 --> 55:10.851
The Moon. It shines light on dark secrets.

55:10.851 --> 55:13.284
She's trying to reveal her secret to me.

55:15.262 --> 55:17.362
The Eight of Cups.

55:17.362 --> 55:21.533
This represents disappointment
and abandonment.

55:21.533 --> 55:24.116
Yeah. Hannah had enough of both.

55:27.444 --> 55:28.674
The Chariot.

55:28.674 --> 55:31.246
It represents courage, strength,

55:31.246 --> 55:36.247
and determination to move
forward, but it's reversed.

55:36.706 --> 55:38.395
What does that mean?

55:38.395 --> 55:40.556
Is there something that
you're running away from?

55:40.556 --> 55:42.006
Why are all these about me?

55:43.016 --> 55:46.677
I don't control the cards.
They show what they show.

55:48.557 --> 55:49.950
Okay, the last card.

55:51.147 --> 55:52.435
What's to come?

55:52.435 --> 55:55.352
(mysterious music)

55:59.459 --> 56:00.332
The Hanged Man.

56:02.909 --> 56:03.743
And?

56:05.460 --> 56:08.763
Traitors used to be hanged
upside down as retribution,

56:09.841 --> 56:13.501
but it can also mean self-sacrifice
as an act of atonement.

56:13.501 --> 56:18.155
Okay, so which was it? Did
she jump or was she pushed?

56:19.682 --> 56:22.113
It's not pointing to either of those.

56:22.113 --> 56:25.566
We expected Hannah's spirit
to be tied to this cabin,

56:26.493 --> 56:29.494
but everything here is telling me that,

56:29.494 --> 56:34.475
whatever it is you're sensing,
it didn't originate here.

56:34.475 --> 56:38.108
No, no, no, because it all
started when I moved here.

56:39.846 --> 56:43.249
I'm sorry. I'm not
getting that from the cards.

56:43.249 --> 56:45.917
(ominous music)

56:50.077 --> 56:50.910
Do it again.

56:53.928 --> 56:55.508
That's not how it works.

56:55.508 --> 56:56.738
Do it again.

56:56.738 --> 56:57.572
Ava.

56:57.572 --> 56:58.959
We have her jewelry.

56:58.959 --> 57:00.819
We have to help her. Do it again.

57:00.819 --> 57:04.090
Well, we're not even
sure that that's Hannah's.

57:04.090 --> 57:05.140
Now you don't believe me?

57:05.140 --> 57:08.020
I mean, you can't go
accusing people of murder.

57:08.020 --> 57:09.611
No. You said it.

57:09.611 --> 57:13.451
You said the Grangers were
rich enough and powerful enough

57:13.451 --> 57:14.831
to cover this whole thing up.

57:14.831 --> 57:19.605
Yeah, but those are rumors
and this is real life,

57:21.643 --> 57:24.646
and you need to take a step back.

57:27.719 --> 57:31.964
Oh my God.

57:31.964 --> 57:33.315
You're covering for them.

57:37.040 --> 57:38.373
(Trina scoffs)

57:38.373 --> 57:40.606
How much did they pay you?

57:40.606 --> 57:42.499
Ava, stop it.

57:43.456 --> 57:44.289
Get out.

57:46.007 --> 57:47.807
Ava, please.

57:47.807 --> 57:49.419
Get the fuck out!

57:49.419 --> 57:51.920
(tense music)

57:55.924 --> 57:57.540
Fuck!

57:57.540 --> 58:00.207
(ominous music)

58:07.617 --> 58:11.118
(ominous music continues)

58:17.642 --> 58:21.143
(ominous music continues)

58:27.609 --> 58:31.109
(ominous music continues)

58:36.522 --> 58:38.252
(engine rumbles)

58:38.252 --> 58:40.856
"Elijah Granger has been
declared mentally unfit

58:40.856 --> 58:42.959
after also attempting to kill himself.

58:43.826 --> 58:46.317
Committed to Brassard Institution.

58:46.317 --> 58:47.547
Little hope of recovery

58:47.547 --> 58:51.152
due to brain damage suffered
in the suicide attempt.

58:51.152 --> 58:56.152
Mr. Catherian, the
night of Jolene's death,

58:56.479 --> 58:59.696
did he seem normal to you, or-

58:59.696 --> 59:01.296
Hi. I'm here to see a patient.

59:02.519 --> 59:03.510
Sign in.

59:03.510 --> 59:05.163
He said he'd been
doing a lot of thinking

59:05.163 --> 59:07.500
and had reached a big decision.

59:07.500 --> 59:10.201
Did he tell you what that decision was?

59:10.201 --> 59:11.398
Paging doctor-

59:11.398 --> 59:12.631
Well, he said that

59:12.631 --> 59:14.365
what he had decided would
change his whole life,

59:14.365 --> 59:15.699
and Moira's too.

59:17.312 --> 59:18.145
That will be all. Thank you.

59:18.145 --> 59:20.375
You're not gonna get much out of Elijah.

59:21.744 --> 59:24.251
I just wanna sit with him.

59:24.251 --> 59:25.803
Oh, that's nice.

59:25.803 --> 59:27.664
Just don't let his face scare you.

59:27.664 --> 59:30.124
I mean, you'd think he
couldn't miss at that range.

59:30.124 --> 59:30.957
What?

59:30.957 --> 59:32.224
I mean, you put the gun in your mouth,

59:32.224 --> 59:33.455
you can't miss, right?

59:33.455 --> 59:35.885
But, see, recoil pulls the gun forward.

59:35.885 --> 59:37.715
It blows off half your face

59:37.715 --> 59:39.996
and a sizeable chunk of your brain.

59:39.996 --> 59:44.712
Just not enough to do the job.
Hence, vegetable for life.

59:44.712 --> 59:47.296
(somber music)

59:54.098 --> 59:56.708
Mr. Granger, guess what?

59:56.708 --> 59:57.972
You got a visitor.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.660
(eerie music)

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:10.271
When you're done or you need anything,

01:00:10.271 --> 01:00:11.671
just give me a holler, okay?

01:00:19.992 --> 01:00:20.865
Hi, Elijah.

01:00:21.913 --> 01:00:22.746
I'm Ava.

01:00:23.623 --> 01:00:25.846
I wanted to talk to you about your sister.

01:00:27.344 --> 01:00:31.700
I know it's been a long time
since she passed, but...

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:34.284
(somber music)

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:45.524

(Elijah groans)

01:00:48.557 --> 01:00:49.390
Elijah?

01:00:51.558 --> 01:00:52.550
What was that?

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:55.938
(Elijah groans)

01:00:55.938 --> 01:00:56.771
What is it?

01:00:57.709 --> 01:00:58.542
Are you...

01:00:58.542 --> 01:01:01.421
(tense music)

01:01:01.421 --> 01:01:02.254
Guilty.

01:01:03.588 --> 01:01:04.421
Guilty.

01:01:06.277 --> 01:01:07.110
Guilty.

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:07.943
Okay.

01:01:07.943 --> 01:01:08.776
Guilty.

01:01:08.776 --> 01:01:09.610
Okay. You're gonna be fine.

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:10.641
Guilty.
Nurse!

01:01:10.641 --> 01:01:12.187
You're gonna be okay, okay?

01:01:12.187 --> 01:01:13.306
Guilty.
I'm sorry.

01:01:13.306 --> 01:01:14.931
Nurse!

01:01:14.931 --> 01:01:15.791
Okay?

01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:16.944
You're gonna be fine.

01:01:16.944 --> 01:01:18.044
I'm so sorry.
Guilty.

01:01:18.044 --> 01:01:19.002
Nurse!

01:01:19.002 --> 01:01:21.203
Guilty!

01:01:21.203 --> 01:01:22.126
What happened?

01:01:23.285 --> 01:01:24.452
It's Elijah.

01:01:27.123 --> 01:01:28.674
What's wrong with him?

01:01:28.674 --> 01:01:30.534
He was screaming.

01:01:30.534 --> 01:01:31.437
I heard him.

01:01:33.133 --> 01:01:35.222
He seems fine to me.

01:01:35.222 --> 01:01:40.223
(Ava panting)
(ominous music)

01:01:45.017 --> 01:01:48.517
(ominous music continues)

01:01:54.894 --> 01:01:58.395
(ominous music continues)

01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:02.180
(Ava screams)

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.970
(tires squeal)

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:06.803
(engine rumbling)

01:02:10.246 --> 01:02:14.431
Guys, I just went to see
Elijah, Hannah's brother,

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:16.709
and he started screaming,
"Guilty, guilty!"

01:02:18.932 --> 01:02:21.733
That's what the Ouija board
was spelling out last night.

01:02:25.448 --> 01:02:28.282
(engine rumbling)

01:02:35.344 --> 01:02:38.261
(foreboding music)

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:49.179
(foreboding music continues)

01:02:56.077 --> 01:02:58.239
(doorknob rattles)

01:02:58.239 --> 01:03:00.272
He's admitting to guilt.

01:03:00.272 --> 01:03:02.940
(ominous music)

01:03:04.211 --> 01:03:06.044
Ava.

01:03:10.235 --> 01:03:12.848
(eerie music)

01:03:12.848 --> 01:03:15.207
(engine rumbles)

01:03:15.207 --> 01:03:18.290
(police siren wails)

01:03:22.189 --> 01:03:25.106
(foreboding music)

01:03:31.584 --> 01:03:35.335
(foreboding music continues)

01:03:41.368 --> 01:03:42.591
(foreboding music continues)

01:03:42.591 --> 01:03:45.842
(police siren wailing)

01:03:52.591 --> 01:03:56.341
(foreboding music continues)

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:06.589
(foreboding music continues)

01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:16.683
(foreboding music continues)

01:04:22.864 --> 01:04:26.614
(foreboding music continues)

01:04:32.792 --> 01:04:36.542
(foreboding music continues)

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.053
(Ava sighs)

01:04:47.455 --> 01:04:49.467
You were weaving all over the lane.

01:04:49.467 --> 01:04:50.487
I know. I'm sorry.

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:52.201
I just dropped something.

01:04:56.338 --> 01:04:58.799
Cracked windshield. That's a violation.

01:04:58.799 --> 01:05:00.209
Oh, I'm getting it fixed.

01:05:00.209 --> 01:05:03.210
Kellen from in town is working on it.

01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:06.933
Good kid. Me and his uncle
went to school together.

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:11.251
Hm.
(ominous music)

01:05:11.251 --> 01:05:12.851
Are you from the Granger family?

01:05:14.932 --> 01:05:16.562
That's my name.

01:05:16.562 --> 01:05:17.395
Yes, but, I mean,

01:05:17.395 --> 01:05:21.456
are you from the Granger
family, like Hannah Granger?

01:05:24.753 --> 01:05:26.417
Since you're new in town,

01:05:26.417 --> 01:05:29.661
I am just gonna give you a fix-it ticket.

01:05:31.605 --> 01:05:33.692
Have a nice day now.

01:05:33.692 --> 01:05:36.609
(foreboding music)

01:05:43.474 --> 01:05:45.575
(foreboding music continues)

01:05:45.575 --> 01:05:47.908
(Ava sighs)

01:05:55.611 --> 01:05:59.362
(foreboding music continues)

01:06:06.054 --> 01:06:09.805
(foreboding music continues)

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.790
(foreboding music continues)

01:06:25.944 --> 01:06:29.695
(foreboding music continues)

01:06:35.578 --> 01:06:39.329
(foreboding music continues)

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:49.770
(foreboding music continues)

01:06:55.293 --> 01:06:56.866
Ava.

01:06:56.866 --> 01:06:58.612
What are you doing here?

01:07:01.067 --> 01:07:02.332
How did you get in?

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:07.550
I'm not gonna hurt you,
but I know what you did.

01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:09.021
Let's just talk.

01:07:09.021 --> 01:07:11.874
I just wanna talk. I just
wanna talk to you, Ava.

01:07:13.101 --> 01:07:15.916
I downloaded your GPS, Ava.

01:07:15.916 --> 01:07:18.411
(Ava screams)

01:07:18.411 --> 01:07:20.613
(stranger indistinctly speaking)

01:07:20.613 --> 01:07:21.572
(Ava screams)

01:07:21.572 --> 01:07:24.879
(pepper spray hisses)
(stranger groaning)

01:07:24.879 --> 01:07:27.380
(tense music)

01:07:28.321 --> 01:07:33.322
(Ava grunts)
(stranger coughing)

01:07:38.383 --> 01:07:41.826
(tense music continues)

01:07:41.826 --> 01:07:44.409
(somber music)

01:07:47.644 --> 01:07:49.977
(van roars)

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:59.439
(engine rumbling)

01:08:04.977 --> 01:08:07.020
Hey, hey, hey, Ava!

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.040
Come to save me again?

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:08.874
Yeah. Maybe.

01:08:08.874 --> 01:08:09.707
What are you doing exactly?

01:08:09.707 --> 01:08:12.012
A stalker broke into my cabin.

01:08:12.012 --> 01:08:12.845
Ava.

01:08:12.845 --> 01:08:14.993
Oh, you don't believe
me? Maybe the sheriff will!

01:08:14.993 --> 01:08:17.243
Okay, okay. Are you sure
that's what you wanna do?

01:08:17.243 --> 01:08:18.076
What is that supposed to mean?

01:08:18.076 --> 01:08:19.732
I'm not judging, Ava, okay?

01:08:19.732 --> 01:08:23.016
We all make mistakes,
but now I'm involved.

01:08:23.969 --> 01:08:24.900
What are you talking about?

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.253
All I'm saying is maybe the sheriff

01:08:26.253 --> 01:08:29.524
is not who you need to be
talking to right now, okay?

01:08:29.524 --> 01:08:31.874
Because he's covering
up for Hannah's murder?

01:08:34.445 --> 01:08:35.435
No.

01:08:35.435 --> 01:08:38.826
Because your uncle is best
friends with the sheriff,

01:08:38.826 --> 01:08:41.706
who's a Granger like Hannah Granger?

01:08:41.706 --> 01:08:42.539
You didn't think to tell me that?

01:08:42.539 --> 01:08:44.647
Okay, Ava, this is not about me, okay?

01:08:44.647 --> 01:08:47.199
I found something under your van.

01:08:47.199 --> 01:08:50.279
(ominous music)

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:51.363
That's him.

01:08:55.384 --> 01:08:56.217
See?

01:08:56.217 --> 01:09:00.071
Okay, listen, I'm gonna
take care of this. Go home.

01:09:00.071 --> 01:09:05.072
(Ava panting)
(ominous music)

01:09:09.161 --> 01:09:10.848
I think we need to
talk to her right now,

01:09:10.848 --> 01:09:12.261
because this is very serious.

01:09:12.261 --> 01:09:13.226
There you are.
Ava.

01:09:13.226 --> 01:09:14.059
Ava.

01:09:14.059 --> 01:09:15.601
Honey, how are you doing?
Get away from me.

01:09:15.601 --> 01:09:16.662
Ava.
Get away from me!

01:09:16.662 --> 01:09:17.970
Ava, we need to get you to the hospital.

01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:19.409
Leave me alone! Stop!

01:09:19.409 --> 01:09:20.815
Honey, we're just trying to help you.

01:09:20.815 --> 01:09:21.773
Can you please talk to me?
No!

01:09:21.773 --> 01:09:23.440
Ava, Ava.

01:09:25.048 --> 01:09:25.943
Don't go!

01:09:25.943 --> 01:09:28.777
(engine rumbling)

01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:38.711
(suspenseful music)
(engines roaring)

01:09:43.672 --> 01:09:47.506
(suspenseful music continues)

01:09:53.507 --> 01:09:58.508
(suspenseful music continues)
(police siren wails)

01:10:00.673 --> 01:10:03.591
(foreboding music)

01:10:10.821 --> 01:10:14.572
(foreboding music continues)

01:10:20.828 --> 01:10:23.601
(foreboding music continues)

01:10:23.601 --> 01:10:26.434
(engines roaring)

01:10:29.119 --> 01:10:32.119
(suspenseful music)

01:10:36.998 --> 01:10:41.999
(police siren wailing)
(suspenseful music continues)

01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:51.384
(suspenseful music continues)

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.562
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:10:54.562 --> 01:10:55.843
No, no, no! You don't understand!

01:10:55.843 --> 01:10:57.942
Oh, I understand, you son of a bitch!

01:10:57.942 --> 01:11:02.028
(police siren wailing)
(stranger groans)

01:11:02.028 --> 01:11:03.929
This whole town is against me.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.753
Even the sheriff is a Granger!

01:11:09.241 --> 01:11:11.270
I know how Hannah feels.

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:15.842
(object clatters)
(Ava gasps)

01:11:15.842 --> 01:11:16.995
What, you get off on van girls, huh?

01:11:16.995 --> 01:11:19.712
All right, all right, all right, Kellen.

01:11:19.712 --> 01:11:21.788
I think you proved your point.

01:11:21.788 --> 01:11:23.523
(stranger groans)

01:11:23.523 --> 01:11:25.356
This psycho has been stalking Ava.

01:11:27.874 --> 01:11:29.067
Is that true?

01:11:29.067 --> 01:11:30.364
(stranger groans)

01:11:30.364 --> 01:11:32.653
Oh, you're God damn right.

01:11:32.653 --> 01:11:35.486
(stranger groans)

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:41.128
(ominous music)

01:11:42.276 --> 01:11:43.739
Hands behind your back.

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.531
I think I hear something.

01:11:51.416 --> 01:11:56.417
(ominous music)
(Ava panting)

01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:04.905
(ominous music continues)

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.034
Go home.

01:12:11.422 --> 01:12:12.554
I'll handle this.

01:12:14.603 --> 01:12:17.186
(somber music)

01:12:18.407 --> 01:12:21.241
(engine rumbling)

01:12:27.223 --> 01:12:29.795
(sheriff sighs)

01:12:29.795 --> 01:12:34.796
(object clatters)
(mouse chittering)

01:12:35.967 --> 01:12:38.551
(Ava chuckles)

01:12:40.726 --> 01:12:42.329
It's just my friend.

01:12:42.329 --> 01:12:44.326
I mean, we can talk now

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:46.840
or you can wait and be
questioned back at the station.

01:12:49.967 --> 01:12:53.031
I've been tracking that
evil woman for weeks.

01:12:54.558 --> 01:12:55.858
Some kind of freak, huh?

01:12:59.359 --> 01:13:00.862
She killed my daughter.

01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:06.473
Well, that's some accusation.

01:13:09.741 --> 01:13:10.641
You got any proof?

01:13:14.447 --> 01:13:16.195
She's driving around in it.

01:13:17.122 --> 01:13:19.789
(ominous music)

01:13:26.174 --> 01:13:29.008
(engine rumbling)

01:13:36.186 --> 01:13:39.187
(crickets chirping)

01:13:41.636 --> 01:13:43.944
I'm gonna check it out. Stay put.

01:13:43.944 --> 01:13:46.612
(ominous music)

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.576
(sheriff knocking on door)

01:13:55.576 --> 01:13:56.410
Hello?

01:13:57.786 --> 01:13:59.203
It's the sheriff.

01:14:00.889 --> 01:14:01.722
Hello?

01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:05.076
It's the sheriff!

01:14:05.076 --> 01:14:07.743
(ominous music)

01:14:14.641 --> 01:14:15.677
Hello?

01:14:15.677 --> 01:14:18.344
(ominous music)

01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:27.045
Hello?

01:14:27.906 --> 01:14:30.573
(ominous music)

01:14:37.903 --> 01:14:41.404
(ominous music continues)

01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:51.311
(ominous music continues)

01:14:58.039 --> 01:14:59.151
Hello?

01:14:59.151 --> 01:15:02.151
(suspenseful music)

01:15:09.885 --> 01:15:11.288
Sheriff!

01:15:11.288 --> 01:15:12.846
Sheriff!

01:15:12.846 --> 01:15:13.929
No! Sheriff!

01:15:13.929 --> 01:15:14.763
What?

01:15:14.763 --> 01:15:16.125
Sheriff, watch out!

01:15:16.125 --> 01:15:17.208
(Ava grunts)
(sheriff groans)

01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:22.209
(stranger screaming)
(tense music)

01:15:27.613 --> 01:15:29.463
Ava, I've called you like 10 times.

01:15:31.904 --> 01:15:33.200
I'm coming over.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:36.117
(foreboding music)

01:15:40.214 --> 01:15:43.047
(drops splashing)

01:15:47.256 --> 01:15:49.756
(eerie music)

01:15:51.838 --> 01:15:54.505
(intense music)

01:15:55.395 --> 01:15:57.896
(Ava screams)

01:16:03.342 --> 01:16:06.009
(ominous music)

01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:08.143
What's happening?

01:16:08.143 --> 01:16:08.977
She's trying to kill me!

01:16:08.977 --> 01:16:09.810
Who?

01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:10.643
Her ghost.

01:16:10.643 --> 01:16:12.789
Come here.
(Ava whimpering)

01:16:12.789 --> 01:16:14.206

Ava, no, no, no. Listen.

01:16:35.448 --> 01:16:37.525
No, no. There's nobody
out there either, okay?

01:16:37.525 --> 01:16:39.326
You're just hallucinating.

01:16:39.326 --> 01:16:40.649

01:16:41.876 --> 01:16:42.709
What is this?

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:48.535

Hannah's killer, Elijah.

01:17:37.233 --> 01:17:38.234
I got him.

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:43.640
What did you do, Ava?

01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:48.013
It was him or us.

01:17:50.283 --> 01:17:51.116
Who?

01:17:53.043 --> 01:17:55.882

01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:20.360
No, no, leave me alone!
I can't do this anymore.

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:21.996
Stop! Stop!

01:20:23.982 --> 01:20:25.296

ever snap out of it.
