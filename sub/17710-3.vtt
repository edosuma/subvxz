00:33.855 --> 00:38.375
Earth is the only planet we
know of where life exists.

00:41.295 --> 00:44.135
And, here, it does so in abundance.

00:49.095 --> 00:51.415
The jungle is Eden.

00:54.375 --> 00:57.974
It covers less than 6%
of the Earth's surface

00:57.975 --> 01:00.134
but it's home to half of all

01:00.135 --> 01:01.975
the plants and animals on land.

01:06.495 --> 01:09.134
Jungles have just the
right amount of light,

01:09.135 --> 01:14.535
water and nutrients, and they
have had every day for millennia.

01:19.175 --> 01:21.975
Life here should be easy.

01:30.655 --> 01:32.375
This is an indri.

01:35.455 --> 01:37.215
It's a primate, like us.

01:38.335 --> 01:42.535
And these forests in
Madagascar are its home.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.295
But to survive here...

01:52.455 --> 01:55.295
...it has to face one major challenge.

02:01.495 --> 02:03.615
Paradise is crowded.

02:07.615 --> 02:09.895
Life fills every niche.

02:12.175 --> 02:17.534
And, at any one time, a staggering
variety of species and countless

02:17.535 --> 02:22.095
individuals are striving
for space and food.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.534
Like every jungle animal,

02:33.535 --> 02:37.094
indri have to find their own way to survive

02:37.095 --> 02:40.215
in the most competitive place on Earth.

02:43.135 --> 02:44.215
(INDRI WAILS)

02:46.535 --> 02:48.655
(INDRI WAILS)

03:05.375 --> 03:07.815
Jungles are complex places...

03:09.415 --> 03:14.815
...tangled three-dimensional worlds
created by lush tropical vegetation.

03:18.815 --> 03:24.095
90% of the animals here spend
their whole lives up in the trees.

03:25.175 --> 03:28.855
And each of them has to find
its own way of getting around.

03:32.215 --> 03:36.415
Hanging 100 feet above the
ground, a spider monkey.

03:42.735 --> 03:46.814
They travel in family groups and
find everything they need in the top

03:46.815 --> 03:48.455
storey of the jungle.

03:50.015 --> 03:53.055
Up here isn't a place
for the faint-hearted.

03:56.495 --> 04:00.614
With long limbs and a prehensile
tail that can grip like a hand,

04:00.615 --> 04:02.135
they're built for climbing.

04:08.895 --> 04:13.775
But imagine having to learn
these skills as high up as this.

04:19.095 --> 04:22.975
One third of spider monkeys
never make it to adulthood.

04:26.455 --> 04:29.215
This youngster is only a few months old.

04:31.575 --> 04:34.855
Her future depends on her ability to climb.

04:37.735 --> 04:41.134
Playing on a practice tree with
her older brother and sister,

04:41.135 --> 04:44.695
she's already learning to use
her tail as a safety line...

04:48.535 --> 04:51.095
...under her father's close watch.

04:57.855 --> 04:59.815
(THEY CHATTER)

05:05.415 --> 05:09.454
She's keen to join in the game
but she's the youngest and,

05:09.455 --> 05:12.615
as is the way of things,
she's not always welcome.

05:16.375 --> 05:17.415
(SHE GIBBERS)

05:18.775 --> 05:21.735
So she chooses her own place to play.

05:27.855 --> 05:30.334
But not all trees are the same.

05:30.335 --> 05:34.095
This one is for more advanced climbers.

05:43.895 --> 05:46.215
Enthusiasm? Certainly!

05:51.095 --> 05:52.534
(SHE GIBBERS)

05:52.535 --> 05:53.575
Technique?

05:55.295 --> 05:57.174
(SHE CHATTERS)

05:57.175 --> 05:58.495
Room for improvement.

06:01.855 --> 06:05.934
Meanwhile, some of her family have
moved on to look for a new patch of

06:05.935 --> 06:06.975
fresh food.

06:09.815 --> 06:12.695
The top of the canopy isn't for youngsters.

06:14.055 --> 06:19.214
But Father's not looking and the
temptation to join the others is

06:19.215 --> 06:20.255
irresistible.

06:27.815 --> 06:30.014
She'll need to be careful.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.935
A fall from here would mean certain death.

06:40.975 --> 06:44.895
It's the first time she's been
as high as this on her own.

06:56.335 --> 07:00.335
As she climbs still higher, the
branches get thinner and thinner.

07:13.855 --> 07:15.375
(SHE SCREECHES)

07:17.015 --> 07:19.535
(SHE SCREECHES)

07:25.215 --> 07:26.775
Her tail has caught her...

07:27.775 --> 07:32.175
...but now she's stuck in mid-air,
unable to reach any other branch.

07:34.295 --> 07:35.695
(SHE SCREECHES)

07:45.375 --> 07:47.735
Father, however, was watching.

07:50.015 --> 07:54.014
He's big and strong enough to form a
bridge with his body so that she can

07:54.015 --> 07:55.055
climb to safety.

08:26.055 --> 08:27.295
Lesson learned.

08:33.414 --> 08:37.455
But it's not just monkeys that
live here, up in the treetops.

08:44.855 --> 08:50.535
And, if you are small, finding the
right tree can mean a home for life.

08:56.455 --> 08:58.534
He's a Draco lizard.

08:58.535 --> 09:02.295
He's only the size of a
pencil and he eats ants.

09:09.855 --> 09:14.734
This one tree could provide him
with all he will ever need...

09:14.735 --> 09:16.575
a conveyor belt of food.

09:20.135 --> 09:22.575
It's a perfect place to settle down.

09:29.415 --> 09:31.015
Well, it would be...

09:33.495 --> 09:35.095
...but there's already someone here.

09:44.655 --> 09:48.334
This larger male is the tree's owner.

09:48.335 --> 09:50.495
And Dracos don't share.

09:58.695 --> 10:01.815
The owner's flag is a warning.

10:05.295 --> 10:07.815
Trespassers won't be tolerated.

10:10.375 --> 10:12.175
The owner's not only intimidating...

10:14.855 --> 10:16.575
...he's prepared to battle.

10:29.535 --> 10:30.575
A dead end.

10:32.695 --> 10:34.735
Safety is a long way away.

10:37.615 --> 10:39.135
Now he must choose.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.055
Fight...

10:45.655 --> 10:47.095
...or flee?

11:03.975 --> 11:08.815
Only in the jungle do you find
lizards that can soar like dragons.

11:12.615 --> 11:16.375
He can travel over 100
feet in a single leap.

11:18.535 --> 11:22.295
It's a very fast and efficient
way to move through the jungle.

11:29.975 --> 11:34.855
Maybe this new tree will have
food and no resident owner.

11:43.215 --> 11:46.855
Everything in the jungle
has to compete for space.

11:52.095 --> 11:55.175
Only 2% of the sun's
rays reach the ground...

11:56.135 --> 11:58.574
...so even the plants
must battle for the light

11:58.575 --> 12:00.135
they need if they're to grow.

12:07.535 --> 12:12.095
300 years ago, this Hura
tree began its race for light.

12:14.055 --> 12:19.414
And every day since, it has absorbed
the water and sunshine it needed to

12:19.415 --> 12:21.495
grow into a giant.

12:30.535 --> 12:34.935
It has succeeded in doing what
every tree must do to survive...

12:36.575 --> 12:39.055
...rise above the gloom
of the jungle floor.

12:47.335 --> 12:51.455
And, what is more, its success
has given life to others.

13:01.735 --> 13:05.615
Its branches now carry 1,000 other plants.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.174
These particular ferns,

13:11.175 --> 13:15.495
figs and orchids live only on
the branches of other trees.

13:20.575 --> 13:24.535
1,000 plants growing on one single tree.

13:26.735 --> 13:30.975
Throughout the forest, this
story is repeated endless times.

13:35.375 --> 13:37.854
As a consequence, jungles are home

13:37.855 --> 13:41.775
to more species of plants
than anywhere else on Earth.

13:42.815 --> 13:47.015
And they, in turn, support
a wealth of animals.

13:52.535 --> 13:56.855
In Ecuador, the competition
is at its most intense.

13:58.855 --> 14:02.215
Here, there are 100 species
of hummingbirds alone...

14:05.295 --> 14:07.135
...all fighting for nectar.

14:09.895 --> 14:13.454
Each flower only has a
small amount at any one time,

14:13.455 --> 14:15.695
and so it's first come, first served.

14:20.495 --> 14:25.334
One hummingbird has gone to
great lengths to avoid conflict

14:25.335 --> 14:26.855
with other species.

14:30.975 --> 14:35.735
Swordbills are the only bird with
a beak longer than their body.

14:38.655 --> 14:42.774
And some flowers are too elongated
for the other 99 species of

14:42.775 --> 14:45.095
hummingbirds here to feed from them.

14:57.655 --> 15:00.414
A swordbill's extraordinary beak, however,

15:00.415 --> 15:03.455
enables it to reach the
places that others can't...

15:07.535 --> 15:11.655
...the top of this flower, where
the sweet nectar is produced.

15:13.415 --> 15:17.975
It has found a solution that means
it doesn't have to join the fight.

15:20.935 --> 15:24.974
And, as each long flower blooms, it
gives the swordbill a fresh supply

15:24.975 --> 15:27.095
of food all to itself.

15:42.895 --> 15:46.855
But having a beak longer than
your body does have its drawbacks.

15:51.735 --> 15:54.375
For a start, it's tricky to keep it clean.

16:06.855 --> 16:10.495
Harder still, how do you
preen your body feathers?

16:13.455 --> 16:14.974
Unlike the other hummers,

16:14.975 --> 16:18.215
swordbills can't reach their
feathers with their beak.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.935
The only option, a good old scratch.

16:47.735 --> 16:49.735
It's a little unrefined...

16:52.215 --> 16:56.455
...but a small price to pay
for an exclusive food supply...

17:00.055 --> 17:04.814
...especially when feeding times
are only too frequently interrupted

17:04.815 --> 17:06.854
by storms.

17:06.855 --> 17:10.615
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

17:14.295 --> 17:16.973
Jungles are the richest places on Earth

17:16.974 --> 17:19.335
because of one remarkable fact...

17:22.615 --> 17:24.454
...they make their own weather.

17:30.335 --> 17:34.735
Every day, water rises from the
surface of the leaves as vapour.

17:37.095 --> 17:40.255
It's as if the trees breathe out clouds.

17:43.215 --> 17:46.335
They gather over the
forest until, finally...

17:49.255 --> 17:50.295
...they burst.

18:05.175 --> 18:08.855
Rain is the lifeblood of every jungle.

18:18.335 --> 18:22.335
And all have to do their best
to endure the daily downpour.

19:05.135 --> 19:08.414
In some jungles, like here in Brazil,

19:08.415 --> 19:12.774
it rains so much that, for
part of the year, the trees are

19:12.775 --> 19:14.455
almost totally submerged.

19:23.335 --> 19:27.175
The forest floor is 30 feet
below the water's surface.

19:30.455 --> 19:36.455
This is a mysterious world, a
place few people have ever explored.

19:45.415 --> 19:49.615
We have much to discover about the
animals for which this is home...

19:53.855 --> 19:59.135
...including some you might never
expect to find amongst trees.

20:12.895 --> 20:17.775
Here, 1,000 miles from
the sea, are dolphins.

20:23.095 --> 20:28.015
A newly identified species of river
dolphin found nowhere else on Earth.

20:40.735 --> 20:41.774
(DOLPHIN WHISTLES)

20:41.775 --> 20:46.774
In these black, tangled waters, they
have become almost totally blind,

20:46.775 --> 20:48.854
so they move slowly,

20:48.855 --> 20:53.535
carefully using their sonar to
scan the forest floor for fish.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.495
If this forest can hide
a new species of dolphin...

21:03.935 --> 21:06.815
...what else might there
be here, awaiting discovery?

21:12.775 --> 21:15.454
At the shallow margins
of the flooded jungle,

21:15.455 --> 21:18.335
rivers flow through lush vegetation.

21:22.215 --> 21:26.535
Here, food is so abundant,
it supports giants.

21:29.175 --> 21:31.935
Capybara, the biggest
rodents in the world...

21:34.615 --> 21:35.655
(GRUNTING)

21:37.935 --> 21:40.255
...giant otters the size of a man...

21:41.495 --> 21:42.695
(THEY SQUEAK)

21:45.415 --> 21:47.654
...and the rulers of these rivers...

21:47.655 --> 21:49.014
(SPLASH)

21:49.015 --> 21:50.055
...caiman.

21:51.815 --> 21:54.734
They grow to ten feet
long and kill anything

21:54.735 --> 21:56.735
they get between their jaws.

22:02.575 --> 22:05.215
But there are more artful hunters...

22:07.135 --> 22:09.695
...drawn here from the surrounding forest.

22:21.975 --> 22:25.735
A jaguar, the supreme jungle predator.

22:33.135 --> 22:35.895
The river marks the
edge of his territory...

22:37.975 --> 22:40.535
...but here he has competition.

22:43.055 --> 22:44.855
(THEY GROWL)

22:45.975 --> 22:48.775
(THEY ROAR)

22:57.255 --> 23:00.135
(THEY GROWL)

23:02.895 --> 23:05.455
He's now in the territory of a female.

23:11.175 --> 23:15.015
She has ruled this stretch
of river for five years.

23:17.455 --> 23:19.935
This is her place to hunt.

23:49.495 --> 23:52.455
Capybara are strong and wary.

23:55.815 --> 23:57.695
The key is stealth.

24:16.055 --> 24:20.535
She needs to get within
three feet if she's to pounce.

24:43.335 --> 24:44.495
Not this time.

24:55.455 --> 24:57.415
She's not the only female here.

24:59.375 --> 25:03.575
Each part of this jungle's edge
is ruled by a different queen.

25:14.575 --> 25:19.535
Few places on Earth have enough
food to support so many big cats.

25:24.415 --> 25:26.655
(LOW GROWL)

25:45.575 --> 25:47.935
The male hunts in a different way.

25:55.535 --> 25:59.615
Weighing almost 300 lbs,
it's hard to be stealthy...

26:02.695 --> 26:05.814
...and with so many other jaguars around,

26:05.815 --> 26:08.575
he doesn't bother with wary capybara.

26:14.935 --> 26:17.135
He seeks a different prey.

26:40.375 --> 26:43.294
He's become a killer

26:43.295 --> 26:44.735
of killers.

27:10.495 --> 27:15.255
Jaguars have the most
powerful bite of any cat.

27:18.735 --> 27:22.175
And he knows the caiman's
most vulnerable point...

27:24.055 --> 27:25.935
...the back of its skull.

27:27.575 --> 27:29.695
(CRUNCHING)

27:53.655 --> 27:57.694
Hunters living in the dense
understorey of the jungle

27:57.695 --> 28:00.175
come in all shapes and sizes.

28:02.535 --> 28:04.695
But they share a problem.

28:10.895 --> 28:14.695
How to tell what is a
plant, and what is prey.

28:18.055 --> 28:22.334
This is a game of hide and
seek that can be won or lost

28:22.335 --> 28:24.055
in the blink of an eye.

28:54.255 --> 28:57.894
The long contest between predator and prey

28:57.895 --> 29:01.535
has produced mimicry
of astounding accuracy.

29:19.055 --> 29:23.495
A leaf-tailed gecko
masquerading as lichen.

29:48.735 --> 29:52.895
Some animals take camouflage
a stage further still...

29:57.215 --> 29:59.294
...and these streams in Costa Rica

29:59.295 --> 30:02.055
are home to one of the most remarkable.

30:12.975 --> 30:14.815
A glass frog.

30:22.655 --> 30:28.454
A male, and tiny, no
bigger than your fingernail

30:28.455 --> 30:31.655
and almost entirely transparent...

30:33.695 --> 30:35.255
...as he needs to be.

30:38.375 --> 30:43.534
Almost everything that walks
past here could eat him,

30:43.535 --> 30:45.055
even a cricket.

30:49.815 --> 30:54.174
His best chance is to stay
absolutely still and trust that

30:54.175 --> 30:56.255
the cricket looks right through him.

31:18.375 --> 31:21.254
Danger passed,

31:21.255 --> 31:24.694
and that's just as well,

31:24.695 --> 31:27.775
because he is a father...

31:30.775 --> 31:33.415
...and he's guarding
some very precious eggs.

31:37.615 --> 31:41.214
For the last few weeks,
females, one after the other,

31:41.215 --> 31:44.495
have visited him and entrusted
him with their offspring.

31:47.775 --> 31:50.535
Some are now almost ready to hatch.

31:54.735 --> 31:58.374
There are several clutches on
the leaf, and those at the top,

31:58.375 --> 32:01.735
the most recently laid,
are barely a day old.

32:07.815 --> 32:11.375
But in the jungle, there's
always someone out to get you.

32:17.615 --> 32:22.135
This wasp is a specialist
hunter of frogs' eggs.

32:24.095 --> 32:28.335
It's noticed the wriggling
tadpoles at the bottom of the leaf.

32:34.015 --> 32:35.215
He mustn't move.

32:36.375 --> 32:39.254
The youngest eggs are the most vulnerable,

32:39.255 --> 32:40.855
and he can't guard them all.

33:00.775 --> 33:04.655
But these tadpoles are not as
helpless as they might appear.

33:12.975 --> 33:17.454
Incredibly, the unhatched
tadpoles can sense danger,

33:17.455 --> 33:22.455
and the oldest and strongest wriggle
free and drop into the stream below.

33:40.255 --> 33:42.974
The eggs at the top of the leaf, however,

33:42.975 --> 33:46.694
are still too young to hatch,

33:46.695 --> 33:49.095
and now the wasps know they're there.

33:53.335 --> 33:57.895
But the male's back looks very
like the youngest cluster of eggs...

34:02.375 --> 34:04.775
...and that seems to confuse the wasps.

34:27.215 --> 34:30.574
Using his own body as
a decoy is a huge risk.

34:31.655 --> 34:33.574
The wasp stings could kill him.

35:01.575 --> 35:04.775
He's managed to save most of his young.

35:09.215 --> 35:14.294
He'll have to remain on
guard for another two weeks,

35:14.295 --> 35:19.295
but in the jungle, just surviving
the day can count as a success.

35:33.775 --> 35:35.414
With the coming of the night,

35:35.415 --> 35:39.095
a new cast of jungle
characters takes to the stage.

35:43.175 --> 35:47.455
Flying insects begin to glow
as they search for mates.

35:51.815 --> 35:56.535
Fungi, unlike plants, thrive in
the darkness of the forest floor.

35:59.615 --> 36:03.494
They're hidden until they begin to
develop the incredible structures

36:03.495 --> 36:05.095
with which they reproduce.

36:08.255 --> 36:11.854
Each releases millions
of microscopic spores

36:11.855 --> 36:14.015
that drift invisibly away.

36:19.575 --> 36:24.214
Many have fruiting bodies that reach
upwards to catch any feeble current

36:24.215 --> 36:26.295
there might be in the clammy air.

36:30.735 --> 36:33.774
But this one, as it grows,

36:33.775 --> 36:35.215
becomes luminous.

36:47.855 --> 36:51.495
Why fungi light up has
remained a mystery...

36:58.295 --> 36:59.535
...until now.

37:08.175 --> 37:11.654
Scientists studying the
brightest fungi in the world

37:11.655 --> 37:13.975
think they may have an answer.

37:19.095 --> 37:22.215
Like a beacon, the light attracts insects.

37:28.855 --> 37:30.815
From far and wide.

37:38.935 --> 37:43.494
To this click beetle, a bright
light means only one thing...

37:43.495 --> 37:46.974
a female click beetle,

37:46.975 --> 37:48.495
so he flashes in reply.

38:00.455 --> 38:03.255
But he doesn't get the
reception he was expecting.

38:08.095 --> 38:13.215
Confused, he starts searching for
a female, and that helps the fungus.

38:15.295 --> 38:19.415
By the time he gives up, he's
covered in the fungus's spores.

38:21.135 --> 38:23.734
And, as he continues
his quest for a female,

38:23.735 --> 38:26.935
he carries these spores to
other parts of the forest.

38:30.455 --> 38:35.015
And there are even stranger
things glowing in the jungle night.

38:38.855 --> 38:43.775
These are the multicoloured
lights of a railroad worm.

38:45.135 --> 38:49.935
It's not really a worm, but a
poisonous, caterpillar-like beetle.

38:53.455 --> 38:56.895
The yellow lights warn other
creatures to keep out of its way.

39:06.375 --> 39:09.295
It's hunting for millipedes.

39:19.375 --> 39:24.175
When it finds the trail of one,
it switches off its yellow lights.

39:30.575 --> 39:33.935
Now it only has a red light on its head.

39:39.415 --> 39:42.295
Millipedes can't see red light.

39:47.375 --> 39:52.935
So, to them, the railroad worm in
stealth mode is virtually invisible.

40:05.535 --> 40:08.055
And that is the end of the millipede.

40:20.495 --> 40:24.454
Competition in the jungles
forces animals to specialise

40:24.455 --> 40:27.494
in every aspect of their life,

40:27.495 --> 40:29.055
including courtship.

40:31.535 --> 40:36.134
This has produced some of the most
beautiful and elaborate displays

40:36.135 --> 40:37.615
on the planet.

40:39.975 --> 40:45.414
- (BIRD SQUAWKS)
- A male red bird-of-paradise,

40:45.415 --> 40:49.015
competing to attract a female by dancing.

40:50.895 --> 40:53.255
One has come to survey what's on offer.

41:11.295 --> 41:13.254
She is an independent lady,

41:13.255 --> 41:18.454
and she will select whichever
male takes her fancy.

41:18.455 --> 41:20.655
(BIRDS SQUAWKING)

41:34.415 --> 41:35.815
She makes her choice.

41:54.295 --> 41:57.255
But now she doesn't seem quite so sure.

42:05.575 --> 42:10.495
No? Perhaps he's just a little too keen.

42:23.815 --> 42:26.095
Maybe he'll have better luck tomorrow.

42:35.335 --> 42:38.695
Red birds-of-paradise
display in the treetops.

42:41.935 --> 42:45.975
Other members of the family dance
in the gloom of the forest floor.

42:49.295 --> 42:52.655
This is a Wilson's
bird-of-paradise.

42:54.175 --> 42:57.495
He's brightly coloured, but
about the size of a sparrow.

43:01.215 --> 43:06.014
He's lived most of his life
alone, but now he's an adult,

43:06.015 --> 43:08.615
and he too needs to attract a mate.

43:13.135 --> 43:16.055
This little patch of
light might help him do so.

43:22.535 --> 43:25.654
First, he tidies things up.

43:25.655 --> 43:30.654
Showing off in this jumble
of leaves wouldn't be easy,

43:30.655 --> 43:34.975
and his beauty will stand out
better against a plain background.

43:43.015 --> 43:47.654
He doesn't want bright leaves
to divert a visitor's attention.

43:47.655 --> 43:49.055
They all need to go.

43:52.815 --> 43:54.255
Even the green ones.

43:57.135 --> 43:58.975
Especially the green ones.

44:08.575 --> 44:11.094
His stage is set.

44:11.095 --> 44:14.574
A central pole, and a
little patch of light.

44:14.575 --> 44:15.615
It's perfect.

44:19.695 --> 44:23.014
And now, he must hope
a female hears his call.

44:23.015 --> 44:24.695
(HIGH-PITCHED SQUAWKING)

44:34.575 --> 44:36.775
He can wait here for weeks on end.

44:46.695 --> 44:48.695
At last, a female.

44:51.495 --> 44:53.775
Time to take up position.

44:56.175 --> 44:59.695
She will judge him by the
brightness of his feathers.

45:05.415 --> 45:08.174
But for the female to see him at his best,

45:08.175 --> 45:13.774
he needs her to perch
directly above his stage,

45:13.775 --> 45:15.175
under the light.

45:18.735 --> 45:22.015
This might be his only chance to shine.

45:28.575 --> 45:33.094
Now, when she's looking directly
down on him, he reveals a display

45:33.095 --> 45:34.935
for her eyes only.

45:40.975 --> 45:43.414
In the gloom of the forest floor,

45:43.415 --> 45:47.215
he is a dazzling blaze of iridescent green.

45:48.975 --> 45:51.775
The brightest leaf in the forest.

46:00.295 --> 46:01.895
And that does the trick.

46:12.015 --> 46:16.254
Each animal must find its own
way of surviving the competition

46:16.255 --> 46:17.775
of the jungle.

46:30.455 --> 46:35.054
This crowded world is so full of
invention that almost all kinds

46:35.055 --> 46:39.415
of animals on land can trace
their origins back here...

46:44.375 --> 46:45.975
...including us.

46:49.455 --> 46:54.255
These forests in Madagascar are
home to one of our distant cousins.

46:58.415 --> 47:03.254
This female indri has fought to
keep this particular patch of forest

47:03.255 --> 47:06.654
safe for herself and her family.

47:06.655 --> 47:10.055
(HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKS)

47:16.375 --> 47:20.494
Every morning, the family
come together to sing,

47:20.495 --> 47:24.455
their way of reminding others
that this is their home.

47:30.775 --> 47:34.214
Indri are so closely adapted to living here

47:34.215 --> 47:37.095
that now they can live nowhere else.

47:40.975 --> 47:46.134
For them and the billions of animals
with whom they share their home,

47:46.135 --> 47:48.655
the jungle is a sanctuary.

47:52.975 --> 47:54.815
But this is changing.

47:58.855 --> 48:02.734
Even in the ten years since the
head of this family was born,

48:02.735 --> 48:06.774
one million hectares of the
rainforest have been destroyed

48:06.775 --> 48:10.334
in Madagascar alone,

48:10.335 --> 48:14.055
and, with it, half the indri
families that once lived there.

48:19.695 --> 48:24.334
The local people say the indris
are our brothers and their song is

48:24.335 --> 48:28.415
a call to remind us that we,
too, once depended on the jungle.

48:37.655 --> 48:41.815
This Eden is still a
place of wonder and magic.

48:47.095 --> 48:50.855
Something, surely, worth protecting.

49:08.655 --> 49:12.454
Jungles are still some of the
least explored places on Earth,

49:12.455 --> 49:14.854
and with good reason.

49:14.855 --> 49:16.815
They are testing places to work.

49:20.495 --> 49:23.094
Here in the flooded forests of Brazil,

49:23.095 --> 49:27.535
the team are on the trail of a newly
discovered species of river dolphin.

49:29.215 --> 49:33.095
So little is known about it that
just finding it will be a challenge.

49:34.735 --> 49:40.774
Their base for five weeks is a hut
on the only bit of dry land around,

49:40.775 --> 49:43.134
but it's already occupied.

49:43.135 --> 49:45.694
It appears someone's been making a nest.

49:45.695 --> 49:47.014
A resident rat.

49:47.015 --> 49:51.134
- Hello, little rat.
- And on the food cupboard...

49:51.135 --> 49:53.975
Hello. Are you a bit shy?

49:58.375 --> 50:02.055
If the housemates are hostile,
the hitchhikers are even worse.

50:04.495 --> 50:06.055
A large spider.

50:07.295 --> 50:08.535
Oh, my God.

50:09.935 --> 50:13.774
And a colony of aggressive
red ants looking for a ride.

50:13.775 --> 50:15.814
Shall we knock into them?

50:15.815 --> 50:19.534
They'll board the boat
like a bunch of pirates,

50:19.535 --> 50:20.975
and they'll gnaw our faces off.

50:24.295 --> 50:26.054
That might not be quite true,

50:26.055 --> 50:29.535
but intimidating animals are
the least of their problems.

50:31.975 --> 50:34.414
The flooded forest is not only vast,

50:34.415 --> 50:38.974
it's impenetrable, and this new
species of dolphin could be anywhere

50:38.975 --> 50:43.215
in 150,000 square miles
of tangled treetops.

50:45.535 --> 50:47.015
But the crew have a plan.

50:48.295 --> 50:51.814
Dolphins use sound to find their
way through the flooded forest

50:51.815 --> 50:53.855
by making clicks. Sonar.

50:54.975 --> 50:58.894
Waterproof microphones allow the
crew to eavesdrop on the dolphins,

50:58.895 --> 51:00.455
and so follow them.

51:04.295 --> 51:06.215
But that's easier said than done.

51:10.375 --> 51:12.854
So, this is the clear path.

51:12.855 --> 51:15.655
Can you see it? There.

51:22.775 --> 51:26.294
It takes them a week to get their
first glimpse of this new species,

51:26.295 --> 51:28.855
and even then, it lasts less than a second.

51:32.215 --> 51:34.575
There appears to be only one dolphin.

51:38.655 --> 51:42.415
And, frustratingly, it can pop
up anywhere without warning.

51:45.335 --> 51:48.254
Been looking through the water
and seeing bodies kind of appear

51:48.255 --> 51:52.055
out of the murk, and then disappear again.

51:54.975 --> 51:58.815
Eventually, the dolphin leads the
crew to an open gap in the forest.

52:09.455 --> 52:11.895
We made it! Yay!

52:15.255 --> 52:18.575
Here, at last, there may be a chance
of getting something in the can.

52:26.095 --> 52:30.695
Their first shot, but again, a
single breath, and then it's gone.

52:35.775 --> 52:38.814
- Hello, you.
- With the dolphin as close as this,

52:38.815 --> 52:41.334
the crew can try a different technique...

52:41.335 --> 52:43.895
towing an underwater
camera behind the boat.

52:47.495 --> 52:50.295
Dolphin literally just
came up parallel to it.

52:51.415 --> 52:54.814
The problem is that the water
is so murky, that the dolphin is

52:54.815 --> 52:57.855
almost invisible, even when
right next to the camera.

53:05.255 --> 53:07.854
However, now the dolphin
is in this channel,

53:07.855 --> 53:09.695
the crew can try a different tack.

53:18.495 --> 53:21.055
Michael Sanderson is a drone operator.

53:24.295 --> 53:26.454
As long as the dolphin's in open water,

53:26.455 --> 53:28.775
it might be possible to
follow it from the air.

53:32.815 --> 53:35.454
We've worked out the
dolphins seem to be here,

53:35.455 --> 53:39.495
and we can do the drone work,
so this is our kind of best bet.

53:40.495 --> 53:43.214
Leaving Michael and his
drone on the sand spit,

53:43.215 --> 53:45.175
the crew head back to open water.

53:46.415 --> 53:49.135
But this is called the
flooded forest for a reason.

53:52.175 --> 53:54.174
The rain here can be torrential,

53:54.175 --> 53:56.974
and although storms normally pass quickly,

53:56.975 --> 53:59.175
this one is clearly not a normal storm.

54:04.615 --> 54:06.494
Is it not working?

54:06.495 --> 54:09.414
The motor has broken, and
with the boat flooding,

54:09.415 --> 54:10.935
the crew must head for the bank.

54:17.255 --> 54:19.134
It looked like the
rainstorm was going to pass,

54:19.135 --> 54:22.334
and it hasn't passed at
all. It's very, very heavy,

54:22.335 --> 54:24.655
and I'm soaked through to the skin.

54:28.655 --> 54:32.334
They're stranded, the
kit is getting drenched,

54:32.335 --> 54:35.694
trees are falling, and Michael
is trapped somewhere down-river.

54:35.695 --> 54:39.534
This is the hardest rain
I've ever seen in my life.

54:39.535 --> 54:43.214
- It's incredible.
- I'm hoping Michael's all right.

54:43.215 --> 54:46.494
And there's been tree fall
all up around behind us.

54:46.495 --> 54:49.374
Michael's down there on
a tiny little sand spit,

54:49.375 --> 54:52.615
with the other boat,
with his opticopter out.

54:53.855 --> 54:55.255
Kind of scary.

54:57.655 --> 54:58.894
After two hours,

54:58.895 --> 55:02.534
a break in the storm gives Michael
a chance to rejoin the team.

55:02.535 --> 55:06.614
Just got caught in one of the
heaviest storms I've ever seen.

55:06.615 --> 55:11.734
Got up to this much water on
the tarp, and the other one, so

55:11.735 --> 55:14.334
I don't know if this is
going to live any more,

55:14.335 --> 55:16.974
because that was on the floor.

55:16.975 --> 55:20.294
It looks like it's game over for the drone.

55:20.295 --> 55:22.415
Yeah, it was pretty scary, wasn't it?

55:24.455 --> 55:28.255
Over the next 12 hours, the
storm returns again and again.

55:29.855 --> 55:31.614
If this bad weather continues,

55:31.615 --> 55:34.575
the crew may not be able to
get back out to the dolphin.

55:40.175 --> 55:42.894
The next morning,

55:42.895 --> 55:46.215
clear skies, and the
drone might be fixable.

55:47.215 --> 55:50.694
But the longer it takes, the
more chance that the dolphin

55:50.695 --> 55:53.814
will have returned to the flooded forest,

55:53.815 --> 55:55.695
and then it'll be back to square one.

55:58.415 --> 56:00.455
But finally, their luck is in.

56:02.735 --> 56:04.335
The dolphin is still there.

56:06.975 --> 56:09.294
For the first time, they
have a chance to film

56:09.295 --> 56:12.614
from the water and the
air, and finally discover

56:12.615 --> 56:15.015
what this elusive animal is really doing.

56:16.695 --> 56:19.814
They were in the boat and they
were looking around and going,

56:19.815 --> 56:22.054
"Yeah, there are some bubbles."

56:22.055 --> 56:25.934
We were flying with the drone
and we could see dolphins,

56:25.935 --> 56:30.574
and while they thought they could
only see one dolphin, we saw five.

56:30.575 --> 56:32.694
And they had no idea.

56:32.695 --> 56:35.934
The crew are surprised to find
these dolphins aren't solitary,

56:35.935 --> 56:38.694
but come together to hunt as a team.

56:38.695 --> 56:41.854
You're starting to see stuff with
the drone that you suddenly go,

56:41.855 --> 56:44.174
"I thought there was
one dolphin there," and

56:44.175 --> 56:47.974
then you count that there are five
and then you're looking in one place

56:47.975 --> 56:50.694
and they're all behind
you, laughing at you.

56:50.695 --> 56:54.134
This new perspective has
given the crew a first glimpse

56:54.135 --> 56:56.174
into a mysterious jungle animal

56:56.175 --> 56:59.655
in one of the least-known
corners of the Earth.

57:08.135 --> 57:12.615
Next time... a land of extremes
that pushes life to the limit.

57:14.855 --> 57:18.495
Animals have extraordinary ways of
dealing with the hostile conditions.

57:20.215 --> 57:24.694
Creating the most epic
survival stories on Earth.

57:24.695 --> 57:26.335
These are deserts.
