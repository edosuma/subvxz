00:02.347 --> 00:04.211
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...What're you doing in Vegas?

00:04.245 --> 00:05.867
I can't just come visit
my big sister?

00:05.902 --> 00:07.317
If this is about Dad,
I don't want to hear it.

00:07.352 --> 00:09.319
Pops has cancer.

00:09.354 --> 00:10.838
I got to go
to work tomorrow.

00:10.872 --> 00:12.322
The casino'd shut down
if you called in sick?

00:12.357 --> 00:14.980
- How you doing?
- Thinks I'm on my death bed.

00:15.015 --> 00:15.981
That's not why she's here, Pop.

00:16.016 --> 00:16.982
Then why then, son?

00:17.017 --> 00:17.983
Because he made me come.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.260
Well, ain't nobody
making you stay.

00:19.295 --> 00:20.468
Okay.

00:20.503 --> 00:22.229
- How can you forgive him so easy?
- He is so scared

00:22.263 --> 00:23.920
that we're never gonna
find a way to forgive him.

00:23.954 --> 00:25.404
I'm not sure I ever will.

00:25.439 --> 00:26.509
We're all here
for you, Pop.

00:26.543 --> 00:28.476
Thank you for coming back.

00:55.779 --> 00:57.436
Always thought that

00:57.471 --> 00:58.955
these were lost
to the '70s.

00:58.989 --> 01:01.440
You sure
they're real?

01:01.475 --> 01:03.718
Oh, the gloves have been authenticated,

01:03.753 --> 01:05.893
along with everything else
up for auction tonight

01:05.927 --> 01:07.343
from the
Feiner Collection.

01:07.377 --> 01:08.792
These bad boys

01:08.827 --> 01:11.761
right here are expected to put
Restoration Auction House

01:11.795 --> 01:14.453
on the map.

01:15.661 --> 01:17.318
What's the going rate

01:17.353 --> 01:19.527
for the ruling class'
"woke trophies" these days?

01:22.668 --> 01:25.982
I think whoever buys them will
be quick to sign a museum lease.

01:26.016 --> 01:27.811
This is a significant sale.

01:27.846 --> 01:28.950
Significant?

01:28.985 --> 01:32.230
Carlos and Smith
raised their fists

01:32.264 --> 01:34.853
in a mute plea
for human rights,

01:34.887 --> 01:37.752
so they made sure that we were
seen on the Olympic stage,

01:37.787 --> 01:39.927
and now you're telling me
that our relics

01:39.961 --> 01:42.343
have been stashed
in some guy's attic?

01:42.378 --> 01:44.207
They wouldn't be here
if Mr. Feiner

01:44.242 --> 01:45.933
hadn't seen
the historical value.

01:45.967 --> 01:49.764
No one man
should own our history.

01:49.799 --> 01:51.870
You know what?

01:51.904 --> 01:53.389
Your mom's back on Sunday,

01:53.423 --> 01:55.943
- I'll see you then.
- Okay, w-wait, um...

01:55.977 --> 01:58.325
Dad, I was gonna
show you the place.

01:58.359 --> 01:59.947
You know, introduce you
to some colleagues.

01:59.981 --> 02:01.707
I thought this would be
nice for you,

02:01.742 --> 02:03.192
uh, your own personal viewing.

02:03.226 --> 02:06.850
I mean, look, it's a step up
from Casino Services, huh?

02:06.885 --> 02:08.818
You're still just
serving booze to rich folks.

02:10.785 --> 02:12.339
You know,
a wealthy casino client

02:12.373 --> 02:14.306
created this position
just for me

02:14.341 --> 02:16.550
when he learned I wanted
to move closer to my folks.

02:16.584 --> 02:18.310
That's how good I am at my job.

02:18.345 --> 02:19.898
Then I'll let you
get back to it.

02:21.279 --> 02:22.625
Ms. Harrelson.

02:24.316 --> 02:26.353
Uh, yes, Julia,
what is it?

02:26.387 --> 02:28.458
Otto needs you
in the East Gallery.

02:28.493 --> 02:30.184
But we don't have guests
arriving for hours. Can he wait?

02:30.219 --> 02:31.427
No, sorry,
he wants you now.

02:31.461 --> 02:32.911
Okay. Uh, Dad,

02:32.945 --> 02:34.740
my intern, Julia...

02:40.919 --> 02:43.611
Okay, uh, please tell
Otto I'm on my way.

02:53.759 --> 02:56.279
Have a good one.

02:56.314 --> 02:58.247
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
guys, guys, deliveries

02:58.281 --> 03:00.214
- go in the back.
- No, there was no one out back.

03:01.974 --> 03:02.975
Okay...

03:03.010 --> 03:04.391
Wait, I have no deliveries
for today.

03:04.425 --> 03:06.876
Yeah, we're here
for pickup.

03:06.910 --> 03:08.981
Nice and calm.

03:09.016 --> 03:11.260
Hope you don't mind
if I borrow this.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.921
Tie him up. Round up any others.

03:17.956 --> 03:20.855
These are the pieces named
in the cease and desist letter.

03:20.890 --> 03:21.994
I've asked
the prep crew

03:22.029 --> 03:23.548
to pull all three
of Toshiko's paintings

03:23.582 --> 03:24.652
before tonight'sauction,

03:24.687 --> 03:26.861
but we'll need to inform
management before making

03:26.896 --> 03:28.277
any program changes.
Problem is,

03:28.311 --> 03:29.933
we're not expecting
full staff till 9:00.

03:29.968 --> 03:32.557
- Okay, what can I do to help?
- Please

03:32.591 --> 03:34.248
call Jeremiah for me.

03:34.283 --> 03:35.870
You're the
VIP whisperer.

03:35.905 --> 03:37.700
Who's more VIP
than the boss?

03:37.734 --> 03:39.253
He'll quiz me,

03:39.288 --> 03:41.393
and I don't have the answers
to questions like...

03:41.428 --> 03:42.981
If there's a debate
over provenance,

03:43.015 --> 03:44.707
how the hell
did they get hung up?

03:47.641 --> 03:48.780
Hey, what are you doing?

03:52.301 --> 03:54.475
Stay quiet.
Follow me, follow me.

03:54.510 --> 03:55.649
Signal box.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.640
Go, go, go, go, go
the other way. Go the other way.

04:24.402 --> 04:26.783
Hands up against the wall!

04:26.818 --> 04:29.234
Against the wall now!

04:29.269 --> 04:30.270
Let's go, people.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.926
Move it.

04:42.937 --> 04:44.905
Everybody, hand over your

04:44.939 --> 04:46.493
cell phones now.

04:52.637 --> 04:55.329
Run, rabbit, run.

04:57.607 --> 05:00.334
Pick up. Pick up, Hondo.

05:00.369 --> 05:02.509
What's the drill,
Commander?

05:02.543 --> 05:04.649
As we speak, downtown units
are responding

05:04.683 --> 05:05.857
to an armed robbery

05:05.891 --> 05:07.893
and a possible hostage
situation at Restoration...

05:07.928 --> 05:09.826
Restoration Auction House.

05:09.861 --> 05:11.587
That's Winnie's new gig.

05:11.621 --> 05:13.416
My pops went there
this morning to see her.

05:13.451 --> 05:14.935
She tried to call
while we were boxing.

05:14.969 --> 05:16.661
You don't think... I don't know.

05:21.390 --> 05:23.633
Hey, this is Winnie.
Leave a message.

05:25.014 --> 05:27.465
She's not answering.

05:27.499 --> 05:30.330
She left a voice mail.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.952
Hondo, they're inside
the building.

05:31.986 --> 05:33.643
People with guns. I...

05:33.678 --> 05:36.197
I can hear them coming.
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Okay, okay.

05:36.232 --> 05:37.682
Listen, we're-we're trapped.

05:37.716 --> 05:41.271
Uh, the windows and doors
are barricaded, and... I got...

05:41.306 --> 05:42.825
I-I-I'm trying to find a place
to hide right now,

05:42.859 --> 05:44.413
but you need
to get here, like, now.

05:44.447 --> 05:46.380
Hondo, we-we need you... Hon...

05:48.934 --> 05:51.489
I can send in 50-Squad if
this hits too close to home.

05:51.523 --> 05:53.594
No, I'm good. Let's roll.

05:53.629 --> 05:55.596
Go, go.

06:09.886 --> 06:11.612
Jeremiah Ward, I'm the owner.

06:11.647 --> 06:13.373
I just can't believe
- this is happening.
- Sergeant David Kay.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.651
LAPD SWAT.
What can you tell us?

06:15.685 --> 06:17.515
I'm just getting here. I was
in traffic, got an SOS text

06:17.549 --> 06:19.206
from a guard, uh,
20-ish minutes ago.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.380
It's been radio silence since.

06:20.414 --> 06:21.657
All right,
how many people inside?

06:21.691 --> 06:24.245
We open to the public at noon,
auction days start late,

06:24.280 --> 06:26.455
so, ten, maybe 12 employees.
Our call out

06:26.489 --> 06:28.318
said armed robbery.
Any idea of their target?

06:28.353 --> 06:29.803
Everything, from the looks
of it. I mean, we've got

06:29.837 --> 06:31.632
anti-theft alerts ringing
in every single gallery.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.703
It's got to be a diversion
to keep us from knowing

06:33.738 --> 06:35.256
exactly where they are
or what they're after.

06:35.291 --> 06:36.775
Which means they're smart.

06:36.810 --> 06:39.399
We got eyes inside? This place
has to be loaded with cameras.

06:39.433 --> 06:40.814
It is, but they've cut off
access from the feed.

06:40.848 --> 06:42.229
We've got nothing out here.

06:42.263 --> 06:43.368
It's locked up like a fortress.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.473
Oh, it's state of the art.

06:44.507 --> 06:45.715
We got reinforced barriers

06:45.750 --> 06:47.337
on every single window and door.

06:47.372 --> 06:48.787
The system is designed to trap

06:48.822 --> 06:50.617
would-be thieves
between the grab and go.

06:50.651 --> 06:51.894
Oh, so save the art
and screw whoever

06:51.928 --> 06:53.309
might be stuck inside,
is that it?

06:53.343 --> 06:55.449
Hondo, the guy
didn't design the system.

06:55.484 --> 06:57.382
- Look, how do we get inside?
- There's a keypad

06:57.417 --> 06:59.280
at the entrance.
I've got a system override code.

06:59.315 --> 07:00.558
- Show us. Come on.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:00.592 --> 07:02.352
Deacon, how many robberies gone
wrong have we seen

07:02.387 --> 07:03.595
where it's the hostages
who pay the price?

07:03.630 --> 07:05.632
Hey. We'll get 'em out.

07:14.295 --> 07:15.952
Lobby's beyond this point,

07:15.987 --> 07:18.403
galleries and auction room
down the hall.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.198
One heat signature,
seated, unmoving.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.579
Nothing else in range.

07:21.613 --> 07:23.719
We don't know who they are
or where they are

07:23.753 --> 07:26.446
or how heavily they're armed.
We're going in blind.

07:28.620 --> 07:29.897
Got the code, Luca?

07:29.932 --> 07:33.314
9614. Should open
any locked door inside.

07:33.349 --> 07:34.730
Go.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.147
Luca.
It's not working.

07:38.181 --> 07:39.528
They must've disabled
door controls.

07:39.562 --> 07:41.288
No way in,
no way out.

07:41.322 --> 07:42.427
Damn it!

07:42.462 --> 07:44.187
They're trapped inside. No.

07:44.222 --> 07:46.707
They got us locked outside.

08:23.468 --> 08:24.538
Hey. I need you to get
those doors open now.

08:24.573 --> 08:25.781
Look, the barriers
are controlled by

08:25.815 --> 08:27.437
the security office
inside the building.

08:27.472 --> 08:28.680
I have no way to override them.

08:32.132 --> 08:33.961
Whoa, whoa, sir, sir,
you can't come through here.

08:33.996 --> 08:35.100
Hondo!
- Whoa, whoa...

08:35.135 --> 08:36.343
Hey, man,
what're you doing, man?

08:36.377 --> 08:38.069
Hey, take your
- hands off me, man.
- Hey! Hey!

08:38.103 --> 08:39.657
Hey, Officer, Officer.
He's with me. He's all right.

08:39.691 --> 08:42.004
- All right.
- Pop, you're okay.

08:42.038 --> 08:43.177
Never mind about me.
Where's your sister?

08:43.212 --> 08:45.041
- Where's Winnie?
- I thought you were with her.

08:45.076 --> 08:46.905
- You didn't answer my calls.
- Listen, I was driving,

08:46.940 --> 08:48.286
I see these cop
cars whizzing by,

08:48.320 --> 08:49.563
one after the next,
one after the next,

08:49.598 --> 08:51.427
and then I hear on the radio
that something's going down,

08:51.461 --> 08:52.946
so I turned the car
around and came back.

08:52.980 --> 08:55.258
Hondo, we got to get Winnie out.

08:55.293 --> 08:56.570
Hey, this is what I do, Pop.

08:56.605 --> 08:58.538
I should be in there with her.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.091
No, no, I'm just glad
you're here.

09:00.125 --> 09:02.024
I think I seen the bad guys
going inside.

09:02.058 --> 09:04.095
- They were wearing medical masks.
- How many?

09:04.129 --> 09:05.441
Don't know, think it was four.

09:05.475 --> 09:07.512
She-she wanted me to take
this tour with her, right,

09:07.547 --> 09:09.928
and I just left, man, I just
left her there. I walked out.

09:09.963 --> 09:13.483
Winnie's gonna be all right.
You hear me? I got this.

09:17.418 --> 09:19.213
Can't be easy for Hondo.

09:19.248 --> 09:22.527
Well, I mean, his sister's
in danger. His dad's scared.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.150
Hell, I'll bet he's wrestling
back his own fears right now.

09:25.185 --> 09:27.187
We're gonna get her out.

09:27.221 --> 09:29.361
No, you wouldn't promise that
to some other hostage's family.

09:30.431 --> 09:33.089
Hicks and mobile command
are a couple blocks out.

09:33.124 --> 09:34.539
How's Hondo?
Chris, you get us

09:34.574 --> 09:36.403
into that building. I don't
care how you do it,

09:36.437 --> 09:37.542
but you figure it out fast.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.164
We've already given them
way too much time inside

09:39.199 --> 09:41.235
- with the captives. Go.
- We got this place surrounded.

09:41.270 --> 09:42.961
There's no way they're
getting out of there.

09:42.996 --> 09:44.100
These guys are armed,
they came here

09:44.135 --> 09:45.274
with some kind of plan.
Now, we got

09:45.308 --> 09:47.103
no way of knowing
what they got cooking,

09:47.138 --> 09:48.415
but I'm starting to think
they're buying time inside.

09:48.449 --> 09:49.347
For what?

10:10.023 --> 10:12.335
- Hey, back against the wall.
- He's bleeding out.

10:12.370 --> 10:14.579
Someone needs to put pressure on
that wound or he's gonna die.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.132
Do you want to do it?

10:23.692 --> 10:26.039
Otto, hand me that tarp.

10:26.073 --> 10:27.488
I don't think
he'll like that.

10:27.523 --> 10:30.319
I can't do this alone. Please.

10:36.497 --> 10:39.293
Okay. All right. Okay.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.197
Julia, you all right?

10:47.198 --> 10:50.235
Come here. Come here.

10:54.688 --> 10:57.070
Look at me.
What's wrong?

10:57.104 --> 10:58.899
I feel like
I can't breathe.

10:58.934 --> 11:02.213
Okay. Okay.
Uh, give me your hand,

11:02.247 --> 11:04.249
give me your hand, come on.
He needs your help.

11:04.284 --> 11:05.595
All right? Hold this.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.115
Hold it right there.

11:08.150 --> 11:09.358
Okay, let's both,
let's both

11:09.392 --> 11:11.256
take a big breath, okay?

11:11.291 --> 11:12.533
Take a big breath.

11:12.568 --> 11:14.466
I can't be here.

11:14.501 --> 11:16.676
I have an anxiety thing, and...

11:16.710 --> 11:19.540
and I... this is- this is a lot.

11:19.575 --> 11:22.026
Okay.

11:22.060 --> 11:24.442
My brother... my brother,
he's a SWAT officer.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.340
Okay?
He's the best of the best.

11:26.375 --> 11:27.963
I bet he's outside right now,

11:27.997 --> 11:30.103
trying to get in.

11:30.137 --> 11:32.381
We just got to figure a way
to keep each other safe.

11:32.415 --> 11:34.314
All right?

11:34.348 --> 11:36.488
Maybe I can help.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.077
It's my phone.

11:39.112 --> 11:41.597
I slipped it in my boot
before he noticed.

11:43.254 --> 11:44.634
I've called every line inside.

11:44.669 --> 11:46.222
- Seems they don't want to talk.
- Keep it ringing.

11:46.257 --> 11:47.983
We got low-res security footage

11:48.017 --> 11:49.985
from the hotel up the street.

11:50.019 --> 11:51.158
We got four people,

11:51.193 --> 11:52.573
large crate,
plates are fake,

11:52.608 --> 11:54.196
but we got the van
in the back alley.

11:54.230 --> 11:55.922
- Any IDs?
- No. No faces

11:55.956 --> 11:57.440
or identifying
marks visible,

11:57.475 --> 11:58.648
- but we're working the van.
- Commander Hicks?

11:58.683 --> 12:00.650
That's right.
This is Sergeant Kay.

12:00.685 --> 12:01.962
Detective Olivia Barlow,
Art Theft.

12:01.997 --> 12:03.274
I'd like to offer my services.

12:03.308 --> 12:06.001
Art theft is a niche world.
I can help you navigate.

12:06.035 --> 12:07.140
Well, we'll take
whatever you have.

12:07.174 --> 12:08.279
I got a current layout

12:08.313 --> 12:10.384
and the original
building plans, too.

12:10.419 --> 12:11.523
All right, put up
the current layout.

12:11.558 --> 12:12.662
What are your initial
thoughts, Detective?

12:12.697 --> 12:14.216
If I'm purely
greed motivated,

12:14.250 --> 12:16.390
I'm targeting the Centennial
Diamonds in the Jewel Gallery.

12:16.425 --> 12:17.909
Or, in the West Gallery,

12:17.944 --> 12:20.084
a duo of multi-million dollar
oil paintings.

12:20.118 --> 12:21.913
Our thieves might be
buying time.

12:21.948 --> 12:23.328
Does that narrow the target?

12:23.363 --> 12:24.571
It tells me they know
this auction house.

12:24.605 --> 12:27.022
All the casings inside
are reinforced glass.

12:27.056 --> 12:28.644
They'd need time to retrieve
whatever they're after.

12:28.678 --> 12:30.439
Any insight on the suspects?

12:30.473 --> 12:32.890
Not yet. Art theft is often
a crime of passion.

12:32.924 --> 12:34.167
If we ID the target,

12:34.201 --> 12:36.100
maybe I can find a connection.
Found a way

12:36.134 --> 12:37.549
to get us inside,
but it's gonna be a loud entry.

12:37.584 --> 12:40.414
That'll give away any tactical
advantage we might have.

12:40.449 --> 12:42.002
The more we know before
we go in, the better.

12:42.037 --> 12:44.280
I assume whatever we're planning
doesn't include explosives?

12:44.315 --> 12:46.248
There is priceless
artwork inside.

12:46.282 --> 12:48.112
Any attempt to blow things up

12:48.146 --> 12:49.907
or shoot things down
could damage precious

12:49.941 --> 12:51.080
cultural treasures.

12:51.115 --> 12:52.495
There are people inside,
lives at risk.

12:52.530 --> 12:53.669
That's our mission.

12:56.189 --> 12:58.087
Yeah, this is Hondo.
Please, you have to listen to...

12:58.122 --> 12:59.537
- Back up. You back away from me.
- Winnie.

12:59.571 --> 13:01.194
- Commander.
- Yup?

13:01.228 --> 13:03.230
It's my sister.
She's on an open line.

13:03.265 --> 13:05.508
You don't understand-- the guard
needs medical attention.

13:05.543 --> 13:07.890
He's still bleeding badly
from his leg wound.

13:07.925 --> 13:10.168
That's on you.
You asked to help.

13:10.203 --> 13:11.514
If he stays here

13:11.549 --> 13:13.102
in the East Gallery with us,
he's going to die.

13:13.137 --> 13:15.277
She told us where they are. Clever.

13:15.311 --> 13:17.244
Chris, tell Tan to call
the East Gallery.

13:17.279 --> 13:18.556
Come on, you know
we're not a threat

13:18.590 --> 13:20.972
to you. The four of you
have assault rifles.

13:21.007 --> 13:23.009
The nine of us just want
to get out of here alive.

13:23.043 --> 13:24.079
Nine hostages.

13:24.113 --> 13:25.114
And with the heat signature

13:25.149 --> 13:26.529
in the lobby,
potentially ten.

13:26.564 --> 13:28.428
MAN 2:
What is going on here?

13:28.462 --> 13:29.601
Why is she talking?

13:32.984 --> 13:34.399
Do they know we're in here?

13:34.434 --> 13:35.676
MAN 2:
Won't matter,

13:35.711 --> 13:36.885
just work the plan.
By the time

13:36.919 --> 13:38.093
they get here,
we'll be gone.

13:40.164 --> 13:42.235
MAN 2:
If everyone plays along,
no one's

13:42.269 --> 13:43.477
gonna get hurt.
Is that understood?

13:43.512 --> 13:45.065
All right, everyone
on your feet.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.343
Move them to the exit.
Leave that guard.

13:47.378 --> 13:48.586
He's only gonna
slow us down.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.106
Let's move! Move!
Go, go! Let's go!

13:53.142 --> 13:55.248
Where do they think they're
going? There are no exits.

13:55.282 --> 13:56.387
Hold up.

13:56.421 --> 13:57.975
I found an archival blueprint

13:58.009 --> 13:59.528
of the original 1920s building

13:59.562 --> 14:02.393
from before the auction house
security renovations.

14:02.427 --> 14:04.153
It marks tunnels
running underneath that

14:04.188 --> 14:05.534
extend past
the property line.

14:05.568 --> 14:06.915
Part of an
underground network

14:06.949 --> 14:08.675
that runs for miles
under the city, used by

14:08.709 --> 14:10.194
- bootleggers during prohibition.
- That leads to

14:10.228 --> 14:11.920
dozens of
entrances and exits

14:11.954 --> 14:13.438
all throughout downtown.

14:13.473 --> 14:15.440
If they slip into
those tunnels... They're in the wind.

14:15.475 --> 14:17.408
That tunnel entrance
is below the Auction Room.

14:17.442 --> 14:18.719
We need to intercept.

14:26.486 --> 14:28.419
They're inside the building.

14:28.453 --> 14:30.662
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Go, go! Go!

14:30.697 --> 14:32.319
- Let's go, come on, faster!
- Move!

14:41.604 --> 14:42.916
He's got a pulse.

14:42.951 --> 14:44.090
Get him out to safety.

14:44.124 --> 14:45.263
Make sure to check
the East Gallery

14:45.298 --> 14:46.609
for the wounded guard
they left.

14:46.644 --> 14:48.922
No sign of them.

14:48.957 --> 14:50.061
They're too far ahead. We can't

14:50.096 --> 14:51.580
- let them get to those tunnels.
- We got 'em.

14:51.614 --> 14:53.133
Just keep going.

14:55.377 --> 14:56.999
Go, go.

15:08.148 --> 15:10.012
Stay here. Wait for my signal.

15:14.396 --> 15:16.363
Come on. The door
to the tunnels is down here.

15:21.644 --> 15:24.958
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's locked.

15:24.993 --> 15:27.271
What do you mean it's locked?
You don't have a key? A code?

15:27.305 --> 15:29.929
This padlock is not
supposed to be here.

15:32.552 --> 15:34.968
It's the same lock my old man
uses on his storage unit.

15:35.003 --> 15:36.452
Bullet's not gonna do it.

15:36.487 --> 15:37.971
We're screwed.

15:38.006 --> 15:39.628
We've got incoming.

15:39.662 --> 15:41.354
Go.

15:47.705 --> 15:48.671
I got eyes.

15:49.707 --> 15:51.985
- LAPD!
- Any closer and I'll shoot.

15:52.020 --> 15:53.642
- Let her go!
- Do not want to push me.

15:53.676 --> 15:55.989
I drop this one,
I got plenty more shields.

15:59.717 --> 16:03.065
All right.
I'm gonna give you your space.

16:04.342 --> 16:06.551
All right, 20-Squad,
back out slowly.

16:28.297 --> 16:28.849
So, our escape
route's blocked.

16:28.884 --> 16:29.781
What's the plan say now?

16:33.544 --> 16:35.787
You want to ask
me that again?

16:35.822 --> 16:39.308
There is no plan anymore.
It's all shot to hell.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.799
Security guards
Ford and Clark are stable,

16:47.834 --> 16:49.318
en route to the hospital now.

16:49.353 --> 16:50.802
What's the update from inside?

16:50.837 --> 16:52.770
All right, well, the gray areas,
we've cleared them,

16:52.804 --> 16:54.737
but the suspects have taken
control of the Auction Room,

16:54.772 --> 16:56.877
effectively barring us
from the rest of the building.

16:56.912 --> 16:59.984
Remaining eight hostages
are being held by four gunmen,

17:00.019 --> 17:02.159
led by an unidentified
white male in his mid-40s.

17:02.193 --> 17:04.057
I just got some intel
that might help.

17:04.092 --> 17:06.749
Suspects' van was cleared
of prints, but the body damage

17:06.784 --> 17:08.337
and make and model
match a vehicle

17:08.372 --> 17:10.098
used recently
in a home robbery.

17:10.132 --> 17:11.961
Only identifying suspect...

17:11.996 --> 17:13.342
- Noah Erickson.
- That's him.

17:13.377 --> 17:14.792
That's their leader.

17:14.826 --> 17:17.208
He was threatening to kill
hostages if we approached.

17:17.243 --> 17:18.761
He held a gun
to Winnie's head.

17:18.796 --> 17:20.453
Has extensive list
of priors,

17:20.487 --> 17:22.972
no pattern to them,
no connection to the art world.

17:23.007 --> 17:24.215
Probably just a hired hand.

17:24.250 --> 17:27.080
He was-he was yelling about
a padlock on the tunnel door,

17:27.115 --> 17:28.806
but Ward, the owner
of the auction house,

17:28.840 --> 17:29.979
says it's not theirs.

17:30.014 --> 17:31.257
He has no idea
where it came from.

17:31.291 --> 17:32.948
You think someone
screwed up the plan?

17:32.982 --> 17:35.088
I don't know. It's hard to say.
But if they feel trapped,

17:35.123 --> 17:36.952
maybe this guy Noah
will want to talk now.

17:36.986 --> 17:40.162
Well, emergency negotiation team
is tied up assisting LASO.

17:40.197 --> 17:42.095
Let's keep ringing
the auction room landline,

17:42.130 --> 17:43.269
see if he
takes the bait.

17:43.303 --> 17:45.098
If he does,
we can pin his location.

17:45.133 --> 17:46.962
You keep him talking,
- we'll move in.
- All right.

17:46.996 --> 17:49.792
Commander, Deacon.
A word?

17:49.827 --> 17:51.760
I'm passing command
over to you, Deacon.

17:51.794 --> 17:53.417
Hey, Hondo, I would've
done the same thing,

17:53.451 --> 17:54.728
pulling the team
out like that.

17:54.763 --> 17:55.867
Engaging them
any further

17:55.902 --> 17:57.317
would have put all
the hostages at risk.

17:57.352 --> 17:59.354
I know that.
And I'm not questioning it,

17:59.388 --> 18:01.183
but she was...

18:01.218 --> 18:02.805
she was right there,

18:02.840 --> 18:04.876
and he was a flinch away from...

18:04.911 --> 18:07.948
She is my blood,
she's my responsibility.

18:07.983 --> 18:09.260
She's our responsibility.

18:09.295 --> 18:10.434
But I'm the one she calls,

18:10.468 --> 18:12.436
and I need to be here
if she tries to again.

18:12.470 --> 18:14.990
We respect your
decision, Sergeant.

18:19.339 --> 18:21.893
Suspects cut three holes
in the East Gallery wall,

18:21.928 --> 18:23.343
then they removed
the paintings from behind.

18:23.378 --> 18:24.862
You're sure about this spot?

18:24.896 --> 18:26.933
Yeah, I just saw the holes
on my way out just now.

18:26.967 --> 18:28.831
Strange that they'd target
these three paintings.

18:28.866 --> 18:31.110
They're painted by
a virtually unknown artist.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.077
Far from the most valuable
pieces in the collection.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.253
If you're right,
this isn't about money.

18:36.287 --> 18:38.393
The motive
must be emotional.

18:38.427 --> 18:40.602
Well, people grow
attached to things.

18:40.636 --> 18:42.224
Value doesn't always matter.

18:43.260 --> 18:44.537
You a collector?

18:44.571 --> 18:46.435
Nah, nah, not me.

18:46.470 --> 18:48.575
But I am the owner of
a Guatemalan food truck

18:48.610 --> 18:50.301
that means more to me
than it makes for me,

18:50.336 --> 18:51.923
so...

18:51.958 --> 18:53.684
Who doesn't appreciate
the craft of a good empanada?

18:53.718 --> 18:55.789
Yeah.

18:55.824 --> 18:57.791
Look...

18:57.826 --> 18:59.793
I-I didn't mean to imply
earlier that the people

18:59.828 --> 19:01.761
were a lesser priority
than the art.

19:01.795 --> 19:03.797
This is a more

19:03.832 --> 19:05.558
high-stakes day at work
than I've had in a while,

19:05.592 --> 19:08.181
and I overstepped.
I apologize.

19:08.216 --> 19:09.355
I may have overreacted.

19:09.389 --> 19:11.322
20-Squad has family
inside today.

19:11.357 --> 19:13.738
You protect the people,
I'll protect the art,

19:13.773 --> 19:15.188
even from friendly fire.

19:16.224 --> 19:17.259
All right.

19:17.294 --> 19:18.536
Luca.

19:18.571 --> 19:20.883
Deacon needs us inside.

19:27.442 --> 19:28.857
Hondo?

19:31.722 --> 19:34.380
Pop, you got
to let me work.

19:34.414 --> 19:35.898
I saw the guards.
You got 'em out. Where's Winnie?

19:35.933 --> 19:37.486
She's still inside.

19:37.521 --> 19:38.867
And what are you
doing outside?

19:38.901 --> 19:40.524
I'm needed in command.
Deacon's gonna lead the team

19:40.558 --> 19:42.491
- in the building.
- Hey, look, if they're trying

19:42.526 --> 19:43.768
to shove you out,
you need to shove right back.

19:43.803 --> 19:45.218
Pop, it was my decision.

19:45.253 --> 19:47.427
Well, it's the wrong decision.

19:47.462 --> 19:49.464
I trusted you

19:49.498 --> 19:50.741
to get Winnie out.

19:50.775 --> 19:52.329
How are you going
to do that from here?

19:52.363 --> 19:53.882
I get that you're worried, but

19:53.916 --> 19:55.884
I don't need you telling me how
to do my job, you understand?

19:55.918 --> 19:59.439
I'm gonna get
Winnie out my way.

20:02.649 --> 20:04.789
- Everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

20:04.824 --> 20:07.378
- My pop just had some questions.
- Trust your instincts.

20:07.413 --> 20:09.449
Focus on the job at hand.
You treat your father

20:09.484 --> 20:11.555
like any other scared,
uninformed parent.

20:11.589 --> 20:13.522
You got that?

20:13.557 --> 20:15.559
It won't be a
problem, sir.

20:15.593 --> 20:17.733
Good.
Deacon and the team are set.

20:29.711 --> 20:31.230
I can't take this.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.541
It just keeps
ringing and ringing

20:32.576 --> 20:34.474
and ringing.

20:34.509 --> 20:35.820
Oh, God,
I can't breathe.

20:35.855 --> 20:37.546
She's freaking me out.

20:37.581 --> 20:38.685
Have some sympathy.

20:39.755 --> 20:41.757
It's okay. It's okay.

20:41.792 --> 20:43.552
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
you focus on me.

20:43.587 --> 20:44.898
Talk to me.
Talk to me.

20:44.933 --> 20:46.659
Why are you working here?

20:46.693 --> 20:50.594
Uh, I'm studying art,

20:50.628 --> 20:53.355
trying to become a curator.

20:53.390 --> 20:55.357
Needed work experience.

20:55.392 --> 20:57.394
Why here?
Why-why not at a museum?

20:57.428 --> 21:01.329
Auction houses are where
works of art test their value.

21:01.363 --> 21:04.366
The people who select
what's up for sale decide

21:04.401 --> 21:06.368
what's seen and prized,

21:06.403 --> 21:09.682
and I want to be one
of them, mix it up.

21:09.716 --> 21:12.650
This sort of passion--
it sounds personal.

21:12.685 --> 21:15.308
My grandmother was an artist.

21:15.343 --> 21:17.655
- Mm.
- Brilliant, but, um,

21:17.690 --> 21:19.657
never sold her work.

21:19.692 --> 21:21.797
The market didn't see her value.

21:23.903 --> 21:26.181
I'm sure
you'll change that someday.

21:33.464 --> 21:35.466
You should know,
you're only pissing me off here.

21:35.501 --> 21:36.674
Not a good idea.

21:36.709 --> 21:38.193
This is Sergeant
Daniel Harrelson.

21:38.227 --> 21:40.229
Am I speaking
with Noah Erickson?

21:43.232 --> 21:44.337
All right, get me
the hell out of here

21:44.372 --> 21:45.821
or we're gonna start shooting.

21:46.891 --> 21:48.893
My team is outside your door.

21:48.928 --> 21:51.586
Command to 30-David.
Erickson's on the line.

21:51.620 --> 21:53.588
Start your approach,
signal when in position.

21:53.622 --> 21:54.934
Doesn't look to me

21:54.968 --> 21:56.625
like you're set up
to be making threats.

21:56.660 --> 21:59.594
Let's work this out--
you and me.

21:59.628 --> 22:01.009
So you can talk me
into a prison cell?

22:01.043 --> 22:02.528
No, thank you, Sergeant.

22:02.562 --> 22:03.701
Tell me how this ends, Noah.

22:03.736 --> 22:05.531
We walk free, Harrelson.

22:05.565 --> 22:06.877
Is that your brother?

22:06.911 --> 22:08.257
Feels to me like

22:08.292 --> 22:09.776
I'm the only one
providing solutions here.

22:09.811 --> 22:11.606
Why would I do that?

22:11.640 --> 22:13.504
No. I'm not releasing anyone.

22:13.539 --> 22:16.921
No one in or out until my people
and I are clear.

22:23.928 --> 22:25.482
If I'm not getting out of here,

22:25.516 --> 22:27.242
I don't know why
anybody else should.

22:27.276 --> 22:28.864
Killing hostages
isn't part of the plan, man.

22:28.899 --> 22:30.383
I know things went sideways.

22:30.418 --> 22:31.729
Did you do this?

22:31.764 --> 22:33.386
Padlock the exit?

22:33.421 --> 22:35.284
Not me, but someone screwed you.

22:35.319 --> 22:37.528
So, look, this isn't all on you,
Noah. Talk to me.

22:38.564 --> 22:40.497
And if I got information?

22:40.531 --> 22:42.257
Share it. See what it buys you.

22:42.291 --> 22:44.501
Tell me who's really
behind all of this.

22:50.299 --> 22:52.163
All right.

22:52.198 --> 22:54.649
He contacted me over a week ago.

22:54.683 --> 22:56.651
Never met, just texted.

22:56.685 --> 22:59.930
He laid out a perfect plan,
mailed supplies.

22:59.964 --> 23:01.483
The guns, the uniforms,
the tools?

23:01.518 --> 23:02.588
That's all him.

23:02.622 --> 23:04.624
I just had to gather a crew,

23:04.659 --> 23:07.455
saw a couple holes, drop off
the goods, collect my fee.

23:07.489 --> 23:08.801
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

23:08.835 --> 23:10.492
The guards
gave me no choice.

23:10.527 --> 23:11.942
Don't make the same mistake now.

23:11.976 --> 23:13.564
You don't want to see
what I'm capable of

23:13.599 --> 23:15.877
when my back's against the wall.

23:15.911 --> 23:18.293
Let me go,
or we shoot our way out.

23:18.327 --> 23:20.778
Noah, no payday
is worth dying for, man.

23:20.813 --> 23:23.229
Let the hostages walk free.
Put your weapons down,

23:23.263 --> 23:25.369
my team will meet you inside,
and we'll talk.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.371
Talk. See, that's
all you want to do.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.236
How about some promises here?
Guarantees?

23:30.270 --> 23:32.376
I got no guarantees
until I get answers, man.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.931
Who hired you?
What did he want you to steal?

23:35.966 --> 23:38.762
That's all I get for my
stories-- just more questions?

23:38.796 --> 23:42.524
I-I told you everything
that I know here, unless...

23:44.526 --> 23:48.288
...unless you don't want me
to get out of here.

23:48.323 --> 23:50.221
You just want to keep me
talking, keep me distracted.

23:50.256 --> 23:51.740
We are done, Sergeant.

23:53.570 --> 23:55.192
All right, they're coming in.
We need to move!

23:55.226 --> 23:56.918
Everyone on your feet!
You heard him. Go!

23:56.952 --> 23:58.954
- Out the door! Go! Go!
- No! Please!

23:58.989 --> 24:00.197
- Get up!
- She's having a panic attack.

24:00.231 --> 24:00.991
If you move her, she's just
gonna pass out. She's gonna

24:01.025 --> 24:01.060
- slow you down.
- Get on your feet!

24:04.339 --> 24:09.275
She's not moving.
And I'm not leaving her.

24:09.309 --> 24:11.657
They are coming, Noah.

24:11.691 --> 24:14.107
Fine.

24:14.142 --> 24:17.007
Maybe their rescue'll buy
a little more time. Let's move!

24:17.041 --> 24:18.664
Move!

24:20.182 --> 24:23.220
Deacon, Noah cut the call.
It didn't go well.

24:23.254 --> 24:24.704
They know you're about
to breach the room.

24:24.739 --> 24:27.258
Roger that.
We need to move to plan B.

24:27.293 --> 24:28.708
Sounds like they're
heading backstage,

24:28.743 --> 24:30.641
- out of the auction room.
- I'm on my way.

24:30.676 --> 24:32.643
Stay out of sight.

24:32.678 --> 24:35.197
Last thing we want
is to escalate.

24:35.232 --> 24:36.682
All right, listen up.
We're moving to plan B.

24:36.716 --> 24:37.890
Prepare your NVGs.

24:37.924 --> 24:39.788
I'll coordinate with LADWP.

24:39.823 --> 24:42.342
Sergeant,

24:42.377 --> 24:44.552
take a beat.

24:48.556 --> 24:50.350
Big breath, Julia.
Big breath.

24:50.385 --> 24:51.697
Okay. It's okay.

24:51.731 --> 24:53.457
It's safe. It's safe now.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.804
No, no, I'm not.
I'm gonna die here.

24:55.839 --> 24:57.426
He'll be back.

24:57.461 --> 24:58.842
You heard him.

24:58.876 --> 25:00.913
You heard him.
SWAT is in the building.

25:00.947 --> 25:02.604
All right?
He'll be here soon.

25:02.639 --> 25:04.364
No. Then we'll get caught
in the crossfire

25:04.399 --> 25:05.642
or mistaken for them.

25:05.676 --> 25:07.747
There's nowhere to hide.

25:07.782 --> 25:10.750
- Nowhere safe.
- Listen to me. There's a secure room.

25:10.785 --> 25:12.925
All right, I'm the only person

25:12.959 --> 25:15.237
in the building
who has the code.

25:15.272 --> 25:17.170
All right?

25:17.205 --> 25:18.758
Come with me.

25:18.793 --> 25:20.795
Okay?

25:22.313 --> 25:23.867
All three paintings
these guys targeted are

25:23.901 --> 25:25.420
by artist Amari Toshiko.

25:25.454 --> 25:28.250
All three were also
just reported stolen.

25:28.285 --> 25:29.631
They haven't left
the building yet.

25:29.666 --> 25:30.529
The auction house received

25:30.563 --> 25:31.322
a cease and desist letter
this morning.

25:31.357 --> 25:32.565
According
to the artist's family,

25:32.600 --> 25:34.153
Toshiko painted the landscapes
while she was held prisoner

25:34.187 --> 25:36.949
at the Manzanar internment camp
during World War II.

25:36.983 --> 25:38.951
The letter claims her work
was stolen by a guard

25:38.985 --> 25:40.331
and later sold
to the Feiner Collection.

25:40.366 --> 25:42.195
The timing between letter
and theft is too close

25:42.230 --> 25:43.265
- to be a coincidence.
- Noah's phone records.

25:43.300 --> 25:47.269
Past ten days,
he's had heavy contact

25:47.304 --> 25:49.340
with a prepaid,
out-of-state number.

25:49.375 --> 25:51.653
The guy who hired him? Maybe
the one behind all of this.

25:51.688 --> 25:54.138
Same number just texted him.
I pinged the phone's location.

25:54.173 --> 25:56.140
Text came
from inside the building.

25:56.175 --> 25:58.004
So we got another
player in the game.

25:58.039 --> 26:00.386
Barlow thinks that the artist's
family might be involved.

26:00.420 --> 26:02.388
I found arrest records.

26:02.422 --> 26:03.734
That's Julia!

26:03.769 --> 26:06.219
Pop, what the hell
are you doing in here?

26:06.254 --> 26:07.462
I said stay back behind.

26:07.496 --> 26:09.050
Oh, Hondo, hold on.

26:09.084 --> 26:11.259
Mr. Harrelson,
how'd you know her name?

26:11.293 --> 26:13.399
I met her this morning.

26:13.433 --> 26:14.745
That's definitely her--
the one on the left.

26:14.780 --> 26:16.264
She's an intern.

26:16.298 --> 26:18.542
She was with Winnie.

26:26.446 --> 26:28.517
Hurry. Please hurry.

26:35.110 --> 26:36.491
What are you doing?

26:36.525 --> 26:38.251
Sorry, Winnie.

26:40.081 --> 26:41.254
Get in there!

27:05.313 --> 27:07.626
A hostage known
as Julia Soto is a suspect.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.213
Sending her photo now.

27:09.248 --> 27:10.283
Roger that, Hondo.

27:46.699 --> 27:49.702
- No! Let me go!
- SWAT. LAPD.

27:49.737 --> 27:50.807
Quiet. You're under arrest.

27:50.841 --> 27:52.601
I got you. You're safe.

27:52.636 --> 27:54.362
One hostage recovered,
one suspect in custody.

27:55.743 --> 27:58.607
In pursuit of another.

28:08.756 --> 28:12.449
Hey, it's okay. It's okay. LAPD.

28:12.483 --> 28:16.798
Here. I'm gonna give you this
so you can see us.

28:16.833 --> 28:19.249
- Can you see me?
- Mm-hmm.

28:19.283 --> 28:20.733
Okay, we're gonna
get you guys out.

28:22.217 --> 28:23.874
Four more hostages recovered.

28:32.952 --> 28:34.747
Drop it! Gun
on the ground now!

28:34.782 --> 28:36.715
On your knees, hands
behind your head!

28:38.613 --> 28:41.374
24-David. Second
suspect in custody.

28:41.409 --> 28:43.135
Come on!

28:51.246 --> 28:53.352
LAPD! Drop your weapon.

28:53.386 --> 28:56.804
Put your hands in the air.

28:56.838 --> 28:59.703
You okay? On your knees.

29:25.798 --> 29:26.765
You still okay?

29:26.799 --> 29:28.490
- Yeah.
- Good.

29:28.525 --> 29:30.561
30-David.
Three suspects contained,

29:30.596 --> 29:33.495
six hostages secured.

29:33.530 --> 29:35.739
No sign of Noah, Julia

29:35.774 --> 29:37.534
or Winnie.

29:37.568 --> 29:41.158
Anybody got eyes
on Winnie?

29:41.193 --> 29:44.368
- Nothing.
- Hondo.

29:44.403 --> 29:46.681
Winnie and I didn't finish
our conversation this morning.

29:46.715 --> 29:49.857
I got angry and...
and lashed out.

29:50.927 --> 29:52.860
Son,

29:52.894 --> 29:55.310
I need you to bring your sister
home for dinner.

29:55.345 --> 29:57.554
You got me?

29:59.590 --> 30:01.627
Take this in case
Winnie calls.

30:01.661 --> 30:03.663
I'm going back in.

30:09.428 --> 30:11.844
Well done, Mr. Erickson.

30:12.914 --> 30:14.674
How do you know my name?

30:14.709 --> 30:16.159
I hired you.

30:16.193 --> 30:17.643
I shipped you half a heist

30:17.677 --> 30:20.163
in a box, joined in the fun,
then texted you

30:20.197 --> 30:21.440
to come meet me here.

30:21.474 --> 30:23.407
Wait, so the paintings
aren't the target?

30:23.442 --> 30:25.409
I wish, but sadly,

30:25.444 --> 30:26.755
those paintings
aren't valued high enough

30:26.790 --> 30:28.481
to be worth all the trouble.

30:28.516 --> 30:31.657
They'll be a notable
distraction, though.

30:31.691 --> 30:33.693
Winnie,
can you tell Noah how much

30:33.728 --> 30:35.834
the Centennial
Diamonds are worth?

30:37.905 --> 30:40.597
Each stone is 100 grand.

30:40.631 --> 30:43.289
There are a hundred diamonds.

30:43.324 --> 30:45.395
He can count.

30:45.429 --> 30:48.605
Ten million.
That's our target.

30:48.639 --> 30:50.400
Why not just tell me
from the start?

30:50.434 --> 30:53.472
Because I needed you
to believe the plan had failed.

30:53.506 --> 30:56.302
Your desperation added
real panic to the mix,

30:56.337 --> 30:59.685
forcing the cops to cut the
power, disabling the cameras.

30:59.719 --> 31:01.756
When they run this day back,

31:01.790 --> 31:04.276
our heist and your escape
won't be recorded.

31:04.310 --> 31:06.416
You take the padlock key.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.763
Exit out the tunnels
with the diamonds.

31:08.797 --> 31:10.869
I get rescued, we meet up.

31:10.903 --> 31:14.217
50/50 split, partner?

31:19.912 --> 31:21.914
Open the case.

31:21.949 --> 31:24.158
Please. No.

31:24.192 --> 31:25.676
I-I mean, I don't...
I don't know

31:25.711 --> 31:26.850
the code.

31:31.441 --> 31:34.168
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Julia?

31:34.202 --> 31:36.239
I had to kill him, right?

31:36.273 --> 31:38.827
I mean, he killed you.

31:38.862 --> 31:40.760
Was about to kill me.

31:40.795 --> 31:42.314
We've cleared backstage,
maintenance area

31:42.348 --> 31:44.557
and the galleries. No sign.

31:44.592 --> 31:45.904
- Detective Barlow, are you there?
- Yes.

31:45.938 --> 31:47.491
Julia's missing,
but we got the paintings.

31:47.526 --> 31:48.941
Narrow the target
to the Admin Wing.

31:48.976 --> 31:50.943
- What would she steal?
- The Centennial Diamonds.

31:50.978 --> 31:53.497
Monetary value aside, the
necklace is a family heirloom,

31:53.532 --> 31:55.292
the pride
of the Feiner Collection.

31:55.327 --> 31:57.260
Its theft would be
an emotional hit.

31:57.294 --> 31:58.778
It's retribution
for Feiner owning

31:58.813 --> 32:01.229
her grandmother's
paintings. Come on.

32:04.750 --> 32:07.339
- Open the case.
- If you're just gonna

32:07.373 --> 32:09.410
shoot me anyway,
why would I do that?

32:09.444 --> 32:10.756
I don't have to kill you
with the first shot

32:10.790 --> 32:12.309
or even the second.

32:12.344 --> 32:14.794
Just open the case, Winnie.

32:26.427 --> 32:28.808
Ma'am, I'm not trying
to mess this up.

32:28.843 --> 32:30.603
Mess this up. You
made this possible.

32:30.638 --> 32:33.227
I didn't have anything
to do with this.

32:34.262 --> 32:37.403
There was no plan
until I met you.

32:37.438 --> 32:41.442
Your access, your easily
manipulated kindness.

32:41.476 --> 32:43.478
I figured you might
even understand,

32:43.513 --> 32:46.136
after hearing you with
your father earlier.

32:46.171 --> 32:49.968
No one man should own
a family's history.

32:53.178 --> 32:55.145
This is personal.

32:55.180 --> 32:57.941
This is about Toshiko.

32:59.563 --> 33:01.910
The cease and desist.

33:01.945 --> 33:03.878
Toshiko is your grandmother.

33:03.912 --> 33:05.880
She never saw a penny
for her work,

33:05.914 --> 33:08.848
and now some man who doesn't
even know her story is about

33:08.883 --> 33:10.850
to make money off of her art.

33:10.885 --> 33:13.819
Why shouldn't I take some of
the millions that she's owed?

33:13.853 --> 33:17.374
Julia Soto will give
her statement today

33:17.409 --> 33:20.515
and disappear before anybody
realizes the jewels are gone.

33:24.623 --> 33:27.729
Quit stalling.
Open the case!

33:45.713 --> 33:47.508
Thanks, Winnie.

33:47.542 --> 33:49.889
Are you kidding me?

33:49.924 --> 33:51.822
Over there-- shot fired!

33:51.857 --> 33:53.859
Deacon, move, move!

33:59.623 --> 34:00.797
Winnie?

34:00.831 --> 34:02.592
Hondo.

34:03.869 --> 34:06.458
Winnie?! Deacon?

34:09.771 --> 34:11.256
No! Winnie!

34:20.265 --> 34:21.956
Aah!

34:21.990 --> 34:23.199
Damn thing's sealed.
We need a code!

34:23.233 --> 34:23.268
30-David to Command. We need
the code to the jewel room.

34:25.718 --> 34:29.239
Aah!

34:29.274 --> 34:32.070
Winnie!

34:32.104 --> 34:33.692
Wait a minute. I remember,
Luca said it earlier.

34:33.726 --> 34:35.038
Ward's override code.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.971
Uh... Nine, six...

34:45.186 --> 34:48.016
9614 opens every door.

34:51.158 --> 34:53.712
- Stay down! Stay down.
- I got him.

34:53.746 --> 34:55.127
Winnie?

34:55.162 --> 34:57.371
- Oh, Hondo.
- Winnie, I got you.

34:57.405 --> 35:01.133
I got you, Winnie.
Winnie, I got you.

35:01.168 --> 35:03.170
I got you.

35:08.209 --> 35:10.038
Oh, thank God. Please!

35:10.073 --> 35:11.109
You have to help me.

35:11.143 --> 35:12.317
You have to help Winnie!

35:14.008 --> 35:16.286
Miss, are you okay?

35:16.321 --> 35:18.323
- You're bleeding.
- No, no, no, it-it's not my blood.

35:18.357 --> 35:19.772
Let's get you to the EMTs.

35:22.085 --> 35:24.329
Don't move!
25 David to Command.

35:24.363 --> 35:26.193
We have Julia Soto in custody.

35:26.227 --> 35:27.987
Hands behind your back now!

35:43.693 --> 35:45.798
Thank you. I'll get these
in the right hands.

35:48.042 --> 35:50.251
You weren't tempted
to pocket those?

35:50.286 --> 35:51.770
No. Bonnie will wish I had.

35:51.804 --> 35:54.117
I know Soto went
about it all wrong, but

35:54.152 --> 35:55.808
I get the fight for her legacy.

35:55.843 --> 35:59.398
She was willing to kill
for a payout.

35:59.433 --> 36:02.850
I won't paint her as some noble
thief worthy of admiration.

36:05.232 --> 36:06.854
You all right?

36:06.888 --> 36:09.822
Everything hurts.

36:09.857 --> 36:12.687
Welcome to my world.

36:12.722 --> 36:13.999
You know,
if this is your day-to-day,

36:14.033 --> 36:15.414
should I be more worried
about you?

36:15.449 --> 36:18.176
I am exhausted,

36:18.210 --> 36:19.763
and I might never trust again.

36:19.798 --> 36:21.972
Your job ain't normal, Hondo.

36:27.702 --> 36:29.014
I can't believe he's still here

36:29.048 --> 36:30.740
after the way
he left things this morning.

36:30.774 --> 36:33.294
He told me
things didn't go very well.

36:33.329 --> 36:36.332
You gonna let him apologize?

36:38.023 --> 36:39.921
When I was held
captive in there,

36:39.956 --> 36:42.752
I kept asking myself,

36:42.786 --> 36:44.926
"What would Hondo do?"

36:44.961 --> 36:48.206
Or even, "What would Dad do?"

36:48.240 --> 36:50.794
Now we're all back here, and

36:50.829 --> 36:52.417
I know it should
be easy for us,

36:52.451 --> 36:54.729
but I keep finding myself

36:54.764 --> 36:57.767
wondering what he thinks of me.

36:57.801 --> 37:00.252
- Or craving his approval.
- Hey.

37:00.287 --> 37:03.186
What you did
on the inside was all you.

37:03.221 --> 37:06.362
Could've done
without the heroics,

37:06.396 --> 37:09.503
but I'm proud of you.

37:09.537 --> 37:12.126
And I bet he is, too.

37:13.714 --> 37:15.681
Just come
to dinner tonight.

37:15.716 --> 37:17.821
While this is all still fresh.

37:17.856 --> 37:19.685
Winnie, just talk to him.

37:19.720 --> 37:23.171
Now, that is my final act
of bravery today.

37:23.206 --> 37:26.278
The Harrelson
hero streak runs deep.

37:27.900 --> 37:30.731
Hondo. Thank you.

37:30.765 --> 37:33.803
I always got
your back, sis.

37:39.774 --> 37:41.811
Some good kids you got there.

37:43.261 --> 37:46.022
You can blame their
mother for that.

37:46.056 --> 37:49.853
You know, I saw 'em--
the robbers.

37:49.888 --> 37:53.305
I didn't know.
I would've stopped, but...

37:53.340 --> 37:55.238
I was caught up
in my own stuff.

37:56.308 --> 38:00.208
I literally walked past
my daughter's captors.

38:01.865 --> 38:03.488
I left my baby unprotected.

38:03.522 --> 38:06.732
Well, she looked to me
like she held her own.

38:06.767 --> 38:09.148
Hey, some, uh...
some unsought advice

38:09.183 --> 38:12.082
from one stubborn old dog
to the next?

38:12.117 --> 38:15.016
Your kids are worthy
of your pride and praise.

38:15.051 --> 38:17.743
They're more than capable
of taking care of business.

38:17.778 --> 38:20.125
- You don't think I know that?
- Of course you do.

38:20.159 --> 38:23.335
But I had to learn the hard way.

38:23.370 --> 38:25.648
You know, sometimes
even grown kids

38:25.682 --> 38:27.443
need to hear
their father's proud of 'em.

38:32.965 --> 38:35.036
You know I don't love
you being right.

38:36.417 --> 38:38.419
You'll get over it.

38:39.938 --> 38:42.768
I think you should return these
paintings to Detective Barlow.

38:42.803 --> 38:44.770
Nah, thanks, we
made our apologies.

38:44.805 --> 38:47.221
Trust me. I think she's gonna
want to say goodbye.

38:47.255 --> 38:49.223
Did you not see the way
she was eyeing you?

38:49.257 --> 38:51.018
Look, I'm not about
to date where I work.

38:51.052 --> 38:53.434
That's never
a smart move.

38:53.469 --> 38:56.264
You expect to work
another art crime anytime soon?

38:56.299 --> 38:58.094
Why not grab a drink,

38:58.128 --> 39:00.372
- maybe flirt a little?
- Huh. Where is this coming from?

39:00.407 --> 39:02.305
It's just been a minute
since I've seen you happy.

39:03.582 --> 39:06.171
I know you spend your nights
watching <i>House Hunters</i> and...

39:09.243 --> 39:11.866
Okay, I guess it couldn't
hurt to say goodbye.

39:11.901 --> 39:13.005
Hey, yo, Detective,

39:13.040 --> 39:14.766
you have a minute?

39:21.186 --> 39:24.776
So, she realizes she's screwed,

39:24.810 --> 39:26.847
and she empties her clip,

39:26.881 --> 39:28.814
and sprints out the door,

39:28.849 --> 39:30.747
probably hoping
a stray bullet would hit me,

39:30.782 --> 39:32.266
or-or she'd get away
before I was found.

39:32.300 --> 39:35.131
I really can't believe
there was no plan B.

39:35.165 --> 39:38.306
I don't if she expected anyone
to be onto her.

39:39.894 --> 39:41.931
Don't tell Brie I said this,

39:41.965 --> 39:46.418
but something about that girl
reminded me so much of her.

39:46.453 --> 39:48.696
The passion and

39:48.731 --> 39:51.872
the planning, the chaos. Uh...

39:51.906 --> 39:54.322
Maybe that's why I was
such an easy mark.

39:54.357 --> 39:57.222
Your kindness
isn't your weakness.

40:00.674 --> 40:02.779
Thanks, Dad.

40:02.814 --> 40:04.436
There's something
I probably should have said

40:04.471 --> 40:06.058
to you earlier today.

40:06.093 --> 40:08.060
I'm proud of your hustle.

40:11.961 --> 40:14.273
And I am grateful
that you moved your life around

40:14.308 --> 40:16.275
so you could come home.

40:16.310 --> 40:20.901
And if I ever do anything
that makes you doubt that,

40:20.935 --> 40:23.144
I want you
to call me on it, okay?

40:24.180 --> 40:25.940
Okay.

40:25.975 --> 40:27.839
Thank you.

40:27.873 --> 40:31.014
Now, how much did Hondo
have to pay you to say that?

40:31.049 --> 40:33.016
I didn't say anything, Winnie.

40:33.051 --> 40:34.673
No, no, no, no.

40:34.708 --> 40:38.677
No, you need to hear this.
And you, too, Hondo.

40:43.717 --> 40:46.789
It's a pain in the ass
getting old,

40:46.823 --> 40:48.998
being forced
to stand on the sidelines

40:49.032 --> 40:52.104
instead of being
in the middle of the action.

40:52.139 --> 40:55.798
And I don't...
I don't take naturally to it.

40:57.420 --> 41:00.009
But today,

41:00.043 --> 41:02.114
I stood and I watched.

41:03.426 --> 41:05.911
I watched you two
take care of business.

41:09.190 --> 41:13.091
It made me so damn proud.

41:18.717 --> 41:21.927
And I appreciate you...

41:21.962 --> 41:25.413
bringing this family
back together.

41:30.798 --> 41:32.800
We love you, too, Pop.

41:32.835 --> 41:35.285
But it might be
our last attempt at

41:35.320 --> 41:37.978
Bring Pops to Work Day, because
all hell'll be breaking lose.

41:40.256 --> 41:41.982
Agreed.

41:42.016 --> 41:43.639
Oh, you're just worried

41:43.673 --> 41:45.813
that I might come
and save the day again.

41:45.848 --> 41:48.367
- Oh, here we go.
- All right, now listen.

41:48.402 --> 41:49.368
Here's what I want
you two to do.

41:49.403 --> 41:51.025
I want you to empty
your pockets,

41:51.060 --> 41:53.062
pull 'em out
and give me all your money.

41:53.096 --> 41:55.236
I'm starting a collection

41:55.271 --> 41:57.307
to liberate
them damn gloves from

41:57.342 --> 42:00.276
the hellhole
- that you call a workplace.
- All right, let's eat.

42:00.310 --> 42:02.381
<i>Let's eat.</i>
