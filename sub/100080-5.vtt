09:38.447 --> 09:40.057
Dennis Upton.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.319
He was scheduled
to work today.

09:41.363 --> 09:42.494
Called in sick
at the last second.

09:42.538 --> 09:43.800
Well, isn't that convenient?Yeah.

09:43.844 --> 09:44.845
All right, tell you what.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.324
You take Tan and Chris.

09:46.368 --> 09:49.153
Go see how sick
this guy really is.

09:49.197 --> 09:51.068
I just got a call
from the hospital.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.722
Officer Hawks
is between surgeries.

09:52.766 --> 09:55.290
He's conscious now.

09:55.333 --> 09:58.249
How well do you know him?

09:58.293 --> 10:00.948
Keen observer,
aren't you, Sergeant?

10:00.991 --> 10:02.950
Hawks was my partner

10:02.993 --> 10:05.300
when we were detectives
in Hollywood Division.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.345
Well, I was thinking
we should go talk to him,

10:07.389 --> 10:09.347
see what he knows that might
help us identify these guys.

10:09.391 --> 10:12.568
Uh, may not be the best
time for us to chat.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.831
He stepped down from
detective last year.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.659
I helped him get the
convoy assignment.

10:16.703 --> 10:19.140
I told him it'd
be an easy gig.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.968
Guess I was wrong.

10:25.363 --> 10:28.366
[birds chirping]

10:28.410 --> 10:29.367
Luca, you're the ranking
P-three-plus-one.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.239
How do you want
to play this?

10:31.282 --> 10:33.284
LUCA:
Well, as my dad used to say,

10:33.328 --> 10:36.331
always start
by knocking on the door.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.463
[automatic gunfire]

10:38.507 --> 10:39.682
Sound like they're coming
from the backyard.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.118
Chris, Tan, two side.
I got the four.

10:43.512 --> 10:44.948
[automatic gunfire]

10:51.955 --> 10:55.002
LAPD! Put your
weapon down!

10:55.045 --> 10:57.874
I said put your gun down!Okay, okay.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.484
Dennis Upton? Thought you
were under the weather.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.704
We were gonna bring soup, but it
doesn't look like you need it.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.706
Is that a tommy gun?

11:07.231 --> 11:09.407
LAPD convoy got
ripped off this morning.

11:09.451 --> 11:12.106
You got over a thousand assault
rifles in your storage shed.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.498
It's not a good look.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.065
You think
I ripped off the police?

11:15.109 --> 11:16.763
Come on, I'm not that crazy.

11:16.806 --> 11:18.286
You're also not that sick.

11:18.329 --> 11:21.463
Yeah, I stayed home to do
target practice for my podcast.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.247
It's called Two Tickets to the Gun Show.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.988
That's original.

11:25.032 --> 11:27.599
Firing assault weapons
in California is illegal.

11:27.643 --> 11:28.905
I'm just a collector.

11:28.949 --> 11:31.038
I mean, that tommy gun
belonged to Mickey Cohen.

11:31.081 --> 11:33.214
[chuckles]:
This piece right here,

11:33.257 --> 11:34.389
Pablo Escobar.

11:34.432 --> 11:35.825
And that,
that was used

11:35.869 --> 11:37.609
in the North Hollywood
shoot-out.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.046
Oh, so you buy guns
from real-life crimes?

11:39.089 --> 11:41.744
Yes, but not
today's real-life crime.

11:41.788 --> 11:42.789
CHRIS:
You sure about that?

11:42.832 --> 11:44.268
This is a special edition Uzi

11:44.312 --> 11:46.096
with Gilly Gembetta's name
engraved on it.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.446
I know, because I booked it
into evidence last year.

11:48.490 --> 11:49.796
It has 11 bodies on it.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.101
The serial number's
been filed off,

11:51.145 --> 11:52.799
but it was definitely inside
that hijacked truck.

11:52.842 --> 11:55.192
Did you hear a cop got shot
during that hijacking?

11:56.759 --> 11:58.152
Okay.

11:58.195 --> 12:00.850
Okay, okay, all right,
I'm in real trouble.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.286
I get it.
TAN:
Yeah, yeah, you are.

12:02.330 --> 12:05.159
I didn't want anybody getting
shot, especially a cop.

12:05.202 --> 12:07.944
It's just I bought guns
from these guys before.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.338
They gave me a great deal.
If I gave them intel

12:10.381 --> 12:11.556
on the convoy,
they'd let me pick

12:11.600 --> 12:13.036
any piece I wanted
from the truck.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.430
I mean, do you know
what the LAPD was gonna do

12:15.473 --> 12:17.301
with this work of art?
Melt it.

12:17.345 --> 12:19.739
Who'd you deal with?I don't know her name.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.566
Some lady with an accent.

12:21.610 --> 12:24.439
Sounds Jamaican.Jamaicans
with big guns?

12:24.482 --> 12:26.093
Could be the Chaos Posse.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.485
Jamaican gunrunners?They got no problem

12:27.529 --> 12:29.096
targeting cops-- work
mainly on the East Coast,

12:29.139 --> 12:30.532
but this definitely
fits their M.O.

12:30.575 --> 12:33.187
Okay, everything that you
got on these Jamaicans.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.711
I mean everything,
no more games.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.017
Okay.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.888
Thanks, Luca.

12:38.932 --> 12:41.195
Chaos Posse operates
in Miami and New York.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.371
What are they
doing in L.A.?
Expansion?

12:43.414 --> 12:45.895
Basic corporate economics:
you're either getting bigger

12:45.939 --> 12:48.724
or you're getting smaller.Well, finding out who
they're selling to

12:48.768 --> 12:51.335
won't be easy-- Chaos Posse
doesn't leave loose ends.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.345
Hey, Ed.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.173
It's me.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.219
Look, you know I
can't stay long.

13:05.262 --> 13:06.742
The people who did this,

13:06.786 --> 13:08.744
anything you remember
about them?

13:13.183 --> 13:15.795
[whispers faintly]:
Don Dada.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.319
No, no. Piper Lynch,

13:18.362 --> 13:20.190
if you don't get out
of this room...

13:20.234 --> 13:21.713
I'm sorry. I'm done.
I'm-I'm leaving.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.193
Miss, miss, miss, miss.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.369
I'm Sergeant Harrelson,
LAPD SWAT.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.632
Pamela Hawks.
Ed's wife.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.417
You're a piece of
work coming here.

13:29.460 --> 13:32.333
I'm just trying to help find
who did this to him.

13:32.376 --> 13:33.595
Well, help somewhere else.

13:36.641 --> 13:38.992
Mrs. Hawks, it's been
an emotional day.

13:39.035 --> 13:41.429
We just needed to ask
a few questions of your husband.

13:41.472 --> 13:43.779
I'm sure he's happy
to see you.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.259
[woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.]

13:48.088 --> 13:50.438
[whispers]:
Hi.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.659
Thanks, Asafa. You, too.

13:54.703 --> 13:57.184
You want to tell me
what that was?

13:57.227 --> 13:59.839
Not especially. Hawks
gave me something, though.

13:59.882 --> 14:02.406
The guy who shot him
was called Don Dada.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.800
It's a term of respect,
probably a street moniker.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.890
Maybe it'll get
us a real I.D.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.893
♪

14:10.937 --> 14:14.244
So this source that we're
looking for is an arms dealer?

14:14.288 --> 14:16.246
Mm, he grew up in a
family of gunrunners.

14:16.290 --> 14:17.726
He's not a criminal.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.902
You think that dressing
in civvies is...

14:19.946 --> 14:21.948
gonna help us
with this informant?

14:21.991 --> 14:24.037
He's not exactly
an informant.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.342
He's a...

14:26.691 --> 14:28.171
...my brother.

It's good to see you.
Back in the LBC.

David Kay.STREET: After everything
went down with my parents,

14:39.226 --> 14:41.881
I moved to a group home--
I used to get my ass beat

14:41.924 --> 14:43.360
on the regular
till Nate taught me

14:43.404 --> 14:46.450
how to fight.You had a decent
knuckle game to start.

14:46.494 --> 14:48.278
It's been a minute.I know.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.367
Lot of memories.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.326
Yeah.

14:52.369 --> 14:56.591
Listen, uh, the reason I'm here
is I need your help.

14:56.634 --> 14:59.420
So you're here to ask a favor?

15:00.247 --> 15:01.248
Seriously?

15:07.123 --> 15:09.691
Nate and I used to be
really close.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.172
He's older, so he left
the group home first.

15:12.215 --> 15:13.695
But he was always
checking on me.

15:13.738 --> 15:16.393
When I got old enough,
I left, too, but I kind of

15:16.437 --> 15:17.829
never looked back.So you ghosted him.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.483
[phone ringing]Not exactly, but...

15:19.527 --> 15:21.268
I needed a clean slate.

15:21.311 --> 15:22.878
I don't think
he sees it that way.

15:22.922 --> 15:23.923
Yeah.

15:25.185 --> 15:27.274
You never visited.I checked in a few times,

15:27.317 --> 15:28.362
to see where we stood.

15:28.405 --> 15:31.321
But you didn't care to find out.

15:32.627 --> 15:35.673
DEACON:
Street. Hondo got a hit
on our shooter.

15:35.717 --> 15:39.286
ATF database identified
Don Dada as Isaac Irie.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.418
Now, he was charged in Queens
for shooting an ATF officer,

15:41.462 --> 15:43.420
but everyone set to testify
against him disappeared

15:43.464 --> 15:45.118
before the trial
even started.

15:45.161 --> 15:48.208
This guy ties up loose ends
and he's dangerous.

15:48.251 --> 15:50.210
You getting anywhere
with your brother?

15:50.253 --> 15:52.473
Don't worry. This is
just how we say hello

15:52.516 --> 15:54.301
in the LBC.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.433
You remember when we
took that blood oath?

15:56.477 --> 15:58.044
You really pulling
that card, bruh?

15:58.087 --> 15:59.654
We were stupid teenagers.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.873
You told me if I
ever needed anything,

16:01.917 --> 16:04.224
I could ask three favors,
and no matter what,

16:04.267 --> 16:05.921
you would have my back.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.011
[chuckles] The first favor was
when you borrowed my chopper

16:09.055 --> 16:10.926
to impress Meg Ullman, right?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.536
You crashed it on the PCH.

16:12.580 --> 16:15.148
And the second favor was
for you to forgive me.

16:15.191 --> 16:18.412
But I never cashed in
the third one, not until now.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.501
The Chaos Posse is
in Long Beach.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.024
They shot a cop.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.374
And now they got
a truckload of guns.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.333
[sighs]

16:26.376 --> 16:28.465
When the Chaos Posse
gets cornered,

16:28.509 --> 16:31.033
they'd rather be buried
by six than judged by 12.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.035
People are
scared of them.

16:33.079 --> 16:36.038
But this bar's like a big TV
set with huge antennas, man.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.388
Lot of roughnecks
roll through here.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.000
Things get said,

16:41.043 --> 16:44.003
and I hear a lot
of those things.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.830
But I'll get into it.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.354
[quietly]:
Thank you.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.051
Let me know.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.054
Thank you.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.100
You know, Lynch,
in my experience,

16:54.143 --> 16:56.754
when a cop's wife is pissed off
at a former female partner,

16:56.798 --> 16:58.147
it tends to be
for one reason.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.367
I thought you were SWAT,
not a detective.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.369
You came in looking
at all our files.

17:02.412 --> 17:06.242
You hit me up about my one SWAT
reprimand from a decade ago.

17:08.331 --> 17:10.029
You seem to know
a lot about us,

17:10.072 --> 17:12.422
but you don't want us to know
anything about you.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.337
You and Hawks?

17:15.382 --> 17:17.340
First rule you learn
as a lady cop:

17:17.384 --> 17:19.342
Don't get involved
with other cops.

17:19.386 --> 17:20.648
And yet?

17:20.691 --> 17:22.128
And yet.

17:22.171 --> 17:24.173
[phone ringing]

17:26.262 --> 17:28.395
Yeah, go ahead, Street.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.484
Roger that.
Street's source came through.

17:30.527 --> 17:33.226
We got an address
on the Chaos Posse's hideout.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.452
Nate says the woman
who owns the strip club

17:42.496 --> 17:44.715
is Isaac Irie's
West Coast sidepiece.

17:46.282 --> 17:49.111
All right, listen up.
We got eyes on the location.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.200
Visual on the one and two sides.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.680
All's quiet
on the Western Front.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.426

Long Beach patrol
has the three side.

17:59.469 --> 18:01.210
This is Detective Gordon.
I authored a search warrant.

five minutes out.

18:50.477 --> 18:51.652
Hands!

19:05.013 --> 19:06.884
Street! Luca!
You hold down the fort!

19:06.928 --> 19:08.625
Let's see if we can get
a better shot!Roger that.

19:12.368 --> 19:13.674
Hey! Time to go!

19:13.717 --> 19:15.458
♪

19:42.529 --> 19:44.400
Searched the Chaos Posse's
hideout, top to bottom.

19:44.444 --> 19:47.142
Found fake passports,
but no sign of long guns.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.492
Recovered two AUG A2s
off the dead posse members.But the majority

19:49.536 --> 19:52.843
of the stolen guns are still
in the wind with Isaac.

19:54.845 --> 19:56.673
GORDON:
Welcome to Long Beach
Southeast Division.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.022
Short on manpower today,

19:58.066 --> 20:00.808
due to training exercises
in Carlsbad.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.333
Travis.
Yeah.

20:04.377 --> 20:07.380
As I said, it's a little
different flavor here.

20:11.819 --> 20:12.776
Thanks.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.909
Hey. You guys LAPD?

20:14.952 --> 20:16.389
Has my bail
been paid yet?

20:16.432 --> 20:18.391
Can you tell me why
I'm still here?

20:18.434 --> 20:20.393
Is this how it is in the LBC?

20:20.436 --> 20:21.437
Now you're getting it.

20:21.481 --> 20:24.571
Ah. Sorry, sir.
Not in our purview.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.747
That's two of our bad boys
and one bad girl accounted for,

20:26.790 --> 20:28.923
leaving five at large,
including Isaac Irie.

20:28.966 --> 20:31.230
The ATF has wires up
on usual suspects.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.232
There was chatter
about potential gun sales

20:33.275 --> 20:35.538
earlier in the day,
but it stopped in the last hour.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.061
Our gunrunner stopped
trying to sell guns?

20:37.105 --> 20:39.499
The Chaos Posse changed
their plan. Why?

20:39.542 --> 20:41.805
We may be
disrupting business.

20:41.849 --> 20:44.808
We may be short on manpower,
but we have every available unit

20:44.852 --> 20:46.854
in the field, searching.Splendid.

20:46.897 --> 20:49.596
In the meantime, I'd love to
have a chat with our bad girl.Sounds good.

20:49.639 --> 20:50.640
HONDO:
Brie,

20:50.684 --> 20:52.033
did you get my message?

20:52.076 --> 20:54.253
BRIANNA: I got it, Hondo.
Just processing.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.776
Dad actually having cancer...

20:55.819 --> 20:57.256
Every time I think
I'm making progress,

20:57.299 --> 20:59.606
he starts talking crazy
about not getting that biopsy.

20:59.649 --> 21:02.086
Have you forgotten
who your father is?HONDO: Oh, here we go.

21:02.130 --> 21:03.392
Every time he's a pain
in the ass, he's my father.

21:03.436 --> 21:04.567
Come on, Brie. I need your help.

21:04.611 --> 21:05.742
What do you expect me to do?

21:05.786 --> 21:07.091
Maybe we gang up on him.

21:07.135 --> 21:08.528
Already tried talking
to my mother and Winnie,

21:08.571 --> 21:09.920
but I haven't heard back
from Winnie.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.182
What else is new?

21:11.226 --> 21:12.836
Don't do that.
You know it's complicated.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.534
The charming dad
that you grew up with

21:14.577 --> 21:17.493
is the same guy who abandoned us
for another woman in Oakland.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.321
Look, he's scared. I get it.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.149
He seems to be okay
with dying, Brie.

21:21.192 --> 21:22.411
I just don't understand
where that's coming from.

21:22.455 --> 21:23.891
He's probably
never gonna tell you.

21:23.934 --> 21:25.936
Once he's made up his mind,
he can't be pushed.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.330
Look, in a few days,
he'll change his mind,

21:28.374 --> 21:29.679
decide to have the surgery.

21:29.723 --> 21:31.420
And what if he doesn't?

21:35.381 --> 21:38.384
Yo, Luca. I heard, uh,
Hondo, Deacon and Chris

21:38.427 --> 21:39.559
went in on the food
truck? Is that true?

21:39.602 --> 21:41.169
Yeah. They asked
to buy shares,

21:41.212 --> 21:42.779
but I'm still evaluating
the offers.

21:42.823 --> 21:44.868
Uh, well, look,
I can't offer any money.

21:44.912 --> 21:46.479
I'm saving for an
engagement ring.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.524
With Bonnie? Dude!Yeah.

21:48.568 --> 21:49.438
Congrats.Yeah, thanks, man.

21:49.482 --> 21:50.918
Awesome, man.Um...

21:50.961 --> 21:53.486
But, hey, what I can offer
is, uh, cooking equipment.

21:53.529 --> 21:54.922
A poker buddy of mine

21:54.965 --> 21:56.750
manages this restaurant
supply warehouse downtown,

21:56.793 --> 21:58.578
and he owes me,
so I can probably

21:58.621 --> 22:00.493
cash in chips for
a Viking oven.

22:00.536 --> 22:01.537
Nice, bro. Those are, like,

22:01.581 --> 22:03.365
what, seven grand a pop?Uh-huh.

22:03.409 --> 22:06.412
All right, I'll let you know if
I decide to take you up on it.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.022
Oh. All right.

22:12.505 --> 22:14.985
Mrs. Hawks.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.987
How's your husband?

22:17.031 --> 22:19.555
Doctors took him in for what
they say is his final surgery.

22:19.599 --> 22:21.514
Ed suggested
I get out of the hospital,

22:21.557 --> 22:22.906
get some fresh air.

22:22.950 --> 22:25.648
But the only place I could
think of coming was here.

22:25.692 --> 22:29.304
Seeing you all at work
helps me know that Ed

22:29.348 --> 22:30.653
is going to be okay.Hmm.

22:30.697 --> 22:31.959
LYNCH:
Hey, Tan.

22:32.002 --> 22:33.003
Let's go talk...

22:34.527 --> 22:36.137
Sergeant Harrelson,

22:36.180 --> 22:37.965
I also came here to apologize

22:38.008 --> 22:39.532
for the way I behaved
at the hospital.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.360
No, there's no
need for that.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.536
I'm just sorry that you have
to go through any of this.

22:43.579 --> 22:46.147
You seem like a decent man.

22:46.190 --> 22:48.932
I assume
you're also a good cop.

22:48.976 --> 22:51.065
Because of that,
I thought you might want to know

22:51.108 --> 22:53.720
what type of person you're
working with in Piper Lynch.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.377
We searched your hideout

22:58.420 --> 23:00.074
and found a passport
that said your name is Tamika.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.336
I don't know if that's real,

23:01.380 --> 23:02.642
but we're gonna
call you that anyway.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.339
Where's Isaac?
He planning to sell those guns

23:04.383 --> 23:05.688
or use them for something else?

23:05.732 --> 23:08.038
Officer Tan and I have
worked together a long time.

23:08.082 --> 23:10.171
He's pushier than me.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.303
When I started as a detective,

23:12.347 --> 23:14.958
my partner and I
worked murder books together.

23:15.002 --> 23:17.439
Me no understand.
Speak plain truth.

23:17.483 --> 23:18.745
Oh, I'm getting to it.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.399
My partner and I dealt
with a lot of hard cases,

23:20.442 --> 23:22.444
so we became
hard cases ourselves.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.185
Didn't matter
if a person was a sinner

23:24.228 --> 23:25.447
or a saint;
we worked every case

23:25.491 --> 23:27.449
like it was the most important
case we ever had.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.711
Except I don't
feel that way

23:28.755 --> 23:31.410
about this one.
This one actually is personal.

23:32.802 --> 23:35.283
You and your friends
shot my former partner,

23:35.326 --> 23:36.676
and you left him to die.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.765
And right before
we walked in here,

23:38.808 --> 23:41.898
Officer Ed Hawks passed away
in his hospital bed,

23:41.942 --> 23:45.467
which means that you are guilty
of murdering a police officer.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.382
The district attorney
is on her way down here

23:47.426 --> 23:49.819
to formally charge you.
She'll be here in ten minutes.

23:49.863 --> 23:53.127
Look, I didn't pull
the gully trigger.

23:53.170 --> 23:55.869
Doesn't matter. You still
get sentenced like you did.

23:57.523 --> 24:00.134
Unless you decide to talk.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.136
Piper was my husband's
partner for seven years.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.704
It wasn't just that she
had an affair with him.

24:04.747 --> 24:07.750
After he tried to end it,
she wouldn't let it go.

24:07.794 --> 24:11.101
Do you know how devastating
a broken family can be?

24:11.145 --> 24:13.452
I have an idea.

24:13.495 --> 24:16.324
She actively tried to
break up my marriage.

24:16.367 --> 24:19.414
I don't tell you
this to gossip.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.156
I tell you because it says
a lot about her ethics,

24:22.199 --> 24:24.201
for whatever that's worth.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.511
TAMIKA:
Them questions you asking

24:29.555 --> 24:32.166
is not really questions
you want an answer to.

24:33.602 --> 24:35.517
It's not what you think it is.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.258
What do you mean by that?Doesn't matter.

24:37.301 --> 24:38.781
I don't want to hear any more
unless you're gonna

24:38.825 --> 24:40.479
tell us where those guns are.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.437
Right now!

24:44.483 --> 24:47.181
Okay.

24:47.224 --> 24:50.184
I'll tell you what
you want to hear.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.752
Tamika gave us Isaac's
plan. The chatter

24:52.795 --> 24:54.580
about gun sales stopped
because the Chaos Posse

24:54.623 --> 24:55.929
decided who to sell to.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.408
TAN:
They're unloading
guns to the Vandals,

24:57.452 --> 24:59.846
Forty-Twos and Baja Diablos.

24:59.889 --> 25:02.544
GORDON:
Three of the most dangerous
crews in Long Beach,

25:02.588 --> 25:03.632
and they all
hate each other.

25:03.676 --> 25:04.894
With guns like that,

25:04.938 --> 25:06.374
they'll start shooting
anything that moves.

25:06.417 --> 25:07.506
And civilians caught
in the middle.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.377
The buys go down within the hour

25:09.420 --> 25:10.857
in three separate locations.HONDO:
Those locations

25:10.900 --> 25:12.206
are spread across Long Beach.

25:12.249 --> 25:13.729
The only way we're gonna make it
is if we split up.

25:13.773 --> 25:15.775
I'll hop on the horn,
help mobilize the few units

25:15.818 --> 25:16.906
we have available.HONDO:
Lynch and I

25:16.950 --> 25:18.386
will coordinate with you.Got it. Hey!

25:18.429 --> 25:19.909
We're gonna need most
of you for this op.Hey, Tan.

25:19.953 --> 25:21.911
How'd you get Tamika to talk?You mean, how did Lynch

25:21.955 --> 25:24.305
get her to talk? You may
want to ask me that later.

25:32.313 --> 25:33.793

Visual on three tweakers.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.799
From the looks of it, probably
members of the Vandals gang,

25:39.842 --> 25:41.235
looking to make a buy
from the Chaos Posse.

25:41.278 --> 25:42.584
LYNCH:
Roger that, 30-David.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.281
Watch your six.
From what Tamika said,

25:44.325 --> 25:45.935
these gun buys are going down
in the next five minutes.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.502

we got something. Let's move.

but not any
from the hijacked truck.

Luca, what do you see
at location number two?

26:28.325 --> 26:30.980
LUCA: Same thing.
We found guns, but small-time.

No sign of Jamaicans.CHRIS: Same thing

26:32.982 --> 26:34.375
at location three, boss.

26:34.418 --> 26:35.637
This isn't the Chaos Posse.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.248
Tamika lied.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.555
She told me
what I wanted to hear.I don't think

26:40.599 --> 26:41.774
it's that simple.They tried

26:41.817 --> 26:43.863
to use us to eliminate
their competition.

26:43.906 --> 26:45.386
It still doesn't explain
what the Chaos Posse

26:45.429 --> 26:46.996
plans on doing
with those guns.

26:51.392 --> 26:52.654
Two visits in one day?

26:52.698 --> 26:54.656
Nate, you already
did me a solid,

26:54.700 --> 26:57.050
and I appreciate that,
and I thank you.Do you know

26:57.093 --> 26:58.442
what the people in
here would do to me

26:58.486 --> 27:01.097
if they knew I did
favors for a cop, man?

27:01.141 --> 27:02.969
Already bad enough, you coming
in here dressed like one.

27:03.012 --> 27:05.275
We are still having no luck

27:05.319 --> 27:07.582
tracking down these guns.Why is that my business?

27:07.626 --> 27:09.279
Because this bar
is a way station

27:09.323 --> 27:10.585
for everything going on
in Long Beach.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.543
If there is anything

27:12.587 --> 27:13.893
that you know that I'm missing,

27:13.936 --> 27:15.459
I could just really use it
right now.

27:15.503 --> 27:16.983
Thought I already
fulfilled our blood oath.

27:17.026 --> 27:17.984
You did.

27:18.027 --> 27:20.203
But I know
that you're a good dude,

27:20.247 --> 27:21.596
so just be a good citizen.

27:23.119 --> 27:24.773
Look, man.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.557
You can't just turn
your back on family

27:26.601 --> 27:28.081
and keep asking for stuff.

27:28.124 --> 27:30.736
When you came in here earlier,
I thought for one second

27:30.779 --> 27:33.173
that maybe you were here just
to say "what's up" to me.

27:33.216 --> 27:34.783
Ask me how I'm doing.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.567
How are you doing, Nate?How's it look?

27:36.611 --> 27:38.091
I'm working in a
bar I don't own,

27:38.134 --> 27:40.093
hanging with the
same low-rent crowd

27:40.136 --> 27:42.530
I've always known.I can help
get you out of here.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.140
That offer always stands, man.

27:44.184 --> 27:47.361
Nah. I'm good.

27:52.801 --> 27:56.631
There is one key on that ring
that I can't use for anything,

27:56.675 --> 28:00.809
but I carry it with me
because it belongs to the bike

You know my dad
was a drinker.

28:08.469 --> 28:09.600
Gave me

28:09.644 --> 28:11.080
my first shot when I was eight.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.212
And I was lucky.

28:12.255 --> 28:13.996
I threw it up. I hated it.

Chaos Posse or not,

talking guns, man.

some dude named Cyfort.

he's a walking RICO case.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.254

29:40.517 --> 29:42.998
Cyfort's why they
changed their plans.

The Chaos Posse stopped
trying to sell guns

40:21.375 --> 40:23.333
and she won't even speak to me.

40:23.377 --> 40:26.249
And I don't blame her.

40:26.293 --> 40:29.252
I just don't feel
like fighting anymore.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.866
I got in a fight
today at work.

40:33.909 --> 40:35.694
And I ain't gonna lie,

40:35.737 --> 40:38.044
I was afraid for my life.

40:38.087 --> 40:40.699
But I fought my way back
here tonight. You know why?

40:40.742 --> 40:43.397
Because that's what my father
taught me a man does.

40:50.535 --> 40:53.102
Maybe I can help make
things better for you.

40:53.146 --> 40:55.844
I can reach out to Winnie and
help you reconnect with her.

40:55.888 --> 40:57.280
See, there you go,

40:57.324 --> 40:59.065
trying to fix things
that can't be fixed.

40:59.108 --> 41:00.806
It ain't never
gonna happen, son.

41:00.849 --> 41:04.070
I get Winnie to sit down
with you after 30 years,

41:04.113 --> 41:06.812
then you get that biopsy.
Is that a deal?

41:06.855 --> 41:08.901
How are you gonna
make that happen?You don't worry about it.

41:08.944 --> 41:11.251
It's my problem.
Is it a deal?

41:12.861 --> 41:14.384
Pop.

41:14.428 --> 41:18.258
We ain't ready
to say goodbye to you yet.

41:30.313 --> 41:31.576
Okay.
