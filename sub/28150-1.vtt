00:28.094 --> 00:30.163
- The woods have always been

00:30.163 --> 00:31.731
where I felt most comfortable.

00:33.466 --> 00:34.367
Safe.

00:35.935 --> 00:39.672
It's society and people that
terrify me.

00:41.307 --> 00:44.344
We hurt, terrorize, and kill
each other

00:44.344 --> 00:45.845
without a second thought.

00:47.013 --> 00:49.649
For reasons that are
meaningless.

00:51.084 --> 00:55.088
In nature, animals only
kill to survive.

00:59.159 --> 01:03.430
This place was our chance
to leave everything behind.

01:05.197 --> 01:06.633
To start our own path.

02:53.439 --> 02:54.440
Sorry, sorry.
- Fuck, dude.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.309
- Watch where the
fuck you're going.

04:17.957 --> 04:21.894
- My choices create my
destiny, not a deck of cards.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.469
Must be a new fad.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.337
I saw another guy out
here with a deck of those

04:31.337 --> 04:33.239
offering readings for money.

04:35.908 --> 04:38.378
Kinda funny when
you think about it.

04:39.245 --> 04:40.146
- What is?

04:41.247 --> 04:43.750
- People who think their
life is predetermined.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.319
- I say if you're
unhappy with your life,

04:46.319 --> 04:47.954
then take charge and change it.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.858
We only have ourselves
to rely on in this world.

04:51.858 --> 04:54.027
Take what you need to make
yourself happy.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.797
- As long as you're
not hurting anyone.

05:04.270 --> 05:05.838
I'm Noah.

05:09.509 --> 05:10.510
- Like the Bible?

05:12.945 --> 05:14.113
- Something like that.

05:15.948 --> 05:16.883
- I'm Patrick.

05:19.385 --> 05:20.320
- Like the saint?

05:25.325 --> 05:28.728
- I haven't seen
you around here before.

05:30.530 --> 05:33.299
- I don't get out very often.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.810
Everything seems
so peaceful up here.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.147
- Things aren't
always as they seem.

05:49.782 --> 05:50.883
Perspective.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.490
- Take it from personal
experience.

05:57.490 --> 06:00.259
You can get yourself
into some bad situations

06:00.259 --> 06:04.230
by making those kind of
assumptions, especially up here.

06:20.680 --> 06:21.814
What does this mean?

06:24.083 --> 06:25.451
- I didn't bring the book.

06:26.919 --> 06:31.991
But I think it has something
to do with balance.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.659
Fairness.

06:35.962 --> 06:37.230
Doing the right thing.

06:46.372 --> 06:47.273
- Hmm.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.091
I respect that guy.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.960
He knows what he wants and
he's not afraid to go after it.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.599
- Isn't that the guy
that hangs out in front

07:13.599 --> 07:16.469
of the dime store that hands
out balloons with the bad wig?

07:18.938 --> 07:19.839
- Howdy boys.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.542
Name's Stan.

07:25.411 --> 07:26.412
Coming?

07:30.249 --> 07:32.084
- I'm sorry,
that wasn't very nice.

07:32.084 --> 07:34.587
- So which one is it?

07:34.587 --> 07:35.688
- Huh?

07:35.688 --> 07:37.423
- You wanna fuck him or be him?

07:38.491 --> 07:39.959
- Neither.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.729
- Love doesn't exist on
Devil's Path, sunshine.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.616
- You better be careful.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.517
- Huh?

08:38.851 --> 08:40.019
- They look like you.

08:47.126 --> 08:48.828
Trail up ahead is
closed.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.764
- Why?

08:54.300 --> 08:56.502
- A couple people
been attacked recently,

08:56.502 --> 08:58.004
and until we find out
what happened to the guys

08:58.004 --> 09:00.339
who went missing up
there, it'll stay closed.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.443
Oh, nice to see
you on the main trail

09:04.443 --> 09:06.345
instead of the side
trails down below.

09:08.414 --> 09:09.849
I'm Ranger Tom.

09:09.849 --> 09:10.750
- Noah.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.486
- This is--
- Mark.

09:13.486 --> 09:14.387
I'm Mark.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.390
At the visitor's center pronto.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.858
Someone let their
dog off the leash

09:18.858 --> 09:21.227
and it's chasing the damn deer.

09:21.227 --> 09:25.398
People and their refusal
to follow simple rules.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.767
You two stay off
the closed trail.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.402
And make sure and make
it down before dark.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.203
Can't help you after that.

09:31.203 --> 09:33.339
I mean it, it's not safe.

09:33.339 --> 09:34.240
Could be a bear.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.747
- Don't get out much, huh?

09:43.883 --> 09:45.484
- Sometimes I like to watch.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.120
Mark.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.590
- I just prefer people
not knowing my real name.

09:51.390 --> 09:52.625
Especially up here.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.161
- So is it really Patrick?

09:57.129 --> 09:59.065
What are you doing?

09:59.065 --> 10:00.366
- Don't be such a pussy.

10:02.301 --> 10:03.536
Live a little.

11:26.452 --> 11:28.487
You should see your face.

11:29.555 --> 11:31.991
See, isn't this better
than the lower trail?

11:35.361 --> 11:37.596
- I guess that depends on
what you're looking for.

11:37.596 --> 11:39.265
- Look around you.

11:39.265 --> 11:41.767
This is exciting, this is real.

11:44.103 --> 11:46.105
- What, sex in the woods?

11:46.105 --> 11:47.306
- Yes.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.374
It's primal.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.609
Tangible.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.279
Nature at its finest.

11:55.581 --> 11:57.650
- Seems a little bit lonely.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.587
- I think that's pretty
judgmental.

12:03.089 --> 12:06.459
- No, no, no, I didn't
mean it like that.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.693
- How did you mean it?

12:10.963 --> 12:13.599
- I walked by a guy
back there who was just

12:13.599 --> 12:17.503
standing in the woods
waiting to be chosen.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.774
Just seems like
kind of a lonely way

12:21.774 --> 12:24.043
to find love or romance.

12:24.043 --> 12:27.113
- You really don't
get out much, do you?

12:27.113 --> 12:30.149
People don't come here
for love or romance.

12:30.149 --> 12:31.517
They come here to get off.

12:33.452 --> 12:37.656
And besides, love is a
chemical reaction in the brain.

12:37.656 --> 12:38.691
It's not real.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.329
- Isn't that a little
judgmental?

12:44.897 --> 12:46.565
- The truth is never judgmental.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.979
You look as spooked as
that ranger back there.

12:59.979 --> 13:03.082
Guys go missing,
people getting attacked,

13:03.082 --> 13:04.316
it's not a bear.

13:04.316 --> 13:05.718
How do you know?

13:05.718 --> 13:07.520
- There'd be tracks or--

13:09.021 --> 13:10.756
- Or?

13:10.756 --> 13:11.690
Remains?

13:13.425 --> 13:15.961
- Sometimes people just
do fucked up things,

13:16.796 --> 13:19.865
and sometimes people
just go missing.

13:19.865 --> 13:22.067
- What do you mean by that?

13:22.067 --> 13:23.502
- Motives can be overrated.

13:26.038 --> 13:28.440
You're so scared, why did you
come with?

13:53.833 --> 13:54.733
What are these?

13:55.768 --> 13:58.537
Is this some
witchcraft or some shit?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.908
- No, it's not witchcraft.

14:02.908 --> 14:04.076
It's a cairn.

14:04.076 --> 14:06.545
Hikers, they use those
to mark alternate trails.

14:08.547 --> 14:12.051
- You must be an avid hiker,
or a witch.

14:16.722 --> 14:18.490
- No, I'm not a witch.

14:18.490 --> 14:21.994
I spent a lot of time
in the woods growing up,

14:21.994 --> 14:23.028
when I was a kid.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.564
Michigan has a
lot of hiking trails.

14:25.564 --> 14:27.766
- Ah, I knew it.

14:27.766 --> 14:29.435
Midwestern boy.

14:29.435 --> 14:30.336
Small town?

14:31.270 --> 14:33.072
- So small it wasn't
even on a map.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.678
- Midwestern boy from a small
town who believes in love.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.448
- What about you?

14:44.049 --> 14:45.584
- Like what?

14:45.584 --> 14:46.552
- Where you from?

14:46.552 --> 14:47.453
- Not here.

14:48.988 --> 14:51.023
- What do you do for work?

14:51.023 --> 14:52.224
- What am I, a suspect?

14:53.125 --> 14:54.493
No.

14:54.493 --> 14:55.928
No, I'm sorry.

14:57.529 --> 14:58.898
I like to ask a lot of
questions,

14:58.898 --> 15:01.500
it makes me feel
comfortable with a person.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.937
I liken people to
a Seurat painting.

15:04.937 --> 15:06.105
- Is that the dot guy?

15:07.806 --> 15:09.475
- Very good.

15:09.475 --> 15:12.878
Each dot is like a shared
experience.

15:13.779 --> 15:15.714
You have enough shared
experiences with somebody

15:15.714 --> 15:18.517
and eventually they'll
come into focus.

15:20.286 --> 15:22.554
- I prefer to keep people
up here to one dot.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.760
My dot is that I'm
an EMT from all over.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.330
- Have you ever
saved someone's life?

15:32.197 --> 15:33.098
- Yeah.

15:34.800 --> 15:35.701
- Cool.

15:37.002 --> 15:38.003
What was it like?

15:38.837 --> 15:40.673
- It's just part of the job.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.380
- So this stuff
fulfills you then?

15:49.481 --> 15:50.382
- What?

15:51.817 --> 15:53.419
- Sex with strangers.

15:54.653 --> 15:56.889
- No, no no no,
it's not a judgment.

15:57.823 --> 15:59.591
I'm genuinely curious.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.227
- It makes me feel.

16:04.530 --> 16:05.431
- Feel what?

16:07.599 --> 16:08.968
- That's it.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.202
It makes me feel.

16:24.950 --> 16:28.053
- Do you get together with
people more than once?

16:28.053 --> 16:30.222
- I have to be honest, Noah,
you're a good-looking guy

16:30.222 --> 16:32.191
and all, but you and I are
clearly looking

16:32.191 --> 16:33.492
for two different things.

16:34.793 --> 16:36.729
- What do you mean?

16:36.729 --> 16:40.366
- It doesn't feel right if I
know too much about a person.

16:40.366 --> 16:43.702
I think this may be where
you and I part ways.

16:43.702 --> 16:46.038
- Wait, wait, I have
to go to the bathroom,

16:46.038 --> 16:48.440
can you just hang
out for a minute?

16:48.440 --> 16:50.075
I don't wanna be
up here by myself,

16:50.075 --> 16:51.710
and I'll be really quick.

16:51.710 --> 16:52.611
Please.

17:41.894 --> 17:42.795
- Noah?

17:44.630 --> 17:45.531
Noah?

17:48.600 --> 17:50.035
Fucking cock blocker.

17:57.076 --> 17:57.976
Hey.

18:06.185 --> 18:07.086
Noah.

18:09.388 --> 18:10.255
Noah.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.257
Whoa, you all right?

18:12.257 --> 18:13.225
Oh, my head.

18:13.225 --> 18:14.426
Let me see.

18:18.063 --> 18:20.199
Oh man, your head's
bleeding, what happened?

18:20.199 --> 18:22.734
- A guy attacked me.

18:22.734 --> 18:24.203
Why?

18:24.203 --> 18:25.971
- I don't know,
he didn't tell me.

18:27.739 --> 18:29.108
Can you walk?

18:30.142 --> 18:32.177
- I just need a minute.

18:32.177 --> 18:33.345
- All right, here, let's
get you to your feet.

18:36.548 --> 18:38.517
- I just need to get my balance.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.853
It's a good thing you called
out, you scared him off.

18:42.521 --> 18:43.755
- You're good?

18:46.258 --> 18:47.326
Hey!

18:53.532 --> 18:54.433
- Shit.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.501
We gotta go.

18:56.535 --> 18:57.936
Get 'em!

19:01.907 --> 19:03.242
Hey, over here!

19:18.023 --> 19:19.925
Come back, you fucker.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.035
You won't get away!

19:43.615 --> 19:44.917
You can't hide!

19:48.787 --> 19:50.255
Look, footprints.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.325
Come on, this way.

19:54.760 --> 19:55.761
Probably took off.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.330
We should keep looking.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.231
Let's go.

20:06.038 --> 20:06.939
- Quiet.

20:21.386 --> 20:26.458
They'll find us here eventually,
we gotta get outta here.

20:26.858 --> 20:28.427
Back country trails.

20:28.427 --> 20:29.595
There's back country hiking
trails

20:29.595 --> 20:31.163
that run all the way
down to the parking lot.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.765
I've seen them on the
visitor's center at the maps.

20:33.765 --> 20:36.001
If we just head in, we'll hit
one of those

20:36.001 --> 20:37.836
and we can take that all
the way down the mountain.

20:37.836 --> 20:40.072
- Yeah, what if we get lost?

20:40.072 --> 20:42.708
- There's a compass in a
small pocket in the back.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.876
Take it out quietly.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.048
- You're gonna get us
outta here with this thing?

20:50.048 --> 20:51.950
- I grew up in the woods,
remember?

20:51.950 --> 20:53.518
Now they are gonna
hear us when we run,

20:53.518 --> 20:55.454
so we have to be
faster than they are.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.791
Are you okay to
run with your asthma?

20:59.791 --> 21:01.693
- Don't worry about me.

21:01.693 --> 21:03.028
- Are you sure?

21:04.429 --> 21:06.064
- I said I'm fine.

21:09.868 --> 21:10.769
- One,

21:11.670 --> 21:12.537
two,

21:13.472 --> 21:14.373
three.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.092
We gotta keep going.

22:13.965 --> 22:15.033
We gotta keep going.

22:17.769 --> 22:19.538
- I need to relax.

22:24.776 --> 22:26.678
Do you think we lost 'em?

22:26.678 --> 22:27.579
- We'll see.

22:29.981 --> 22:30.882
- What's wrong?

22:36.788 --> 22:37.689
- Just dizzy.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.800
Easy, easy,
too much at once will--

22:50.669 --> 22:51.837
- Jesus Christ.

22:55.307 --> 22:56.742
This is fucking insane.

22:57.576 --> 22:59.077
What are we gonna do?

22:59.077 --> 23:00.579
Whatever we have to.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.518
- Where are you going?

23:06.518 --> 23:08.220
- I just wanna
get a closer look.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.588
- Not too far.

23:09.588 --> 23:11.790
You hear anything,
take off running,

23:11.790 --> 23:14.059
I'll follow the sound
of your running, okay?

23:15.293 --> 23:16.628
Okay?

24:32.671 --> 24:35.073
Leaving me back there for so
long?

24:44.783 --> 24:47.719
- I told you what to do
if you heard anything.

24:47.719 --> 24:48.553
Are you ready?

24:48.553 --> 24:49.788
- Wait.

24:49.788 --> 24:51.823
Water usually ends up somewhere.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.358
Could this take us out?

24:53.358 --> 24:57.329
This is just runoff from
all the rain this year.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.498
Now what we need to do is we
need to find

24:59.498 --> 25:00.732
that trail to get down.

25:02.901 --> 25:05.403
- What happened to your back?

26:22.147 --> 26:25.517
- Probably only a few more
hours of daylight left.

26:28.853 --> 26:29.754
- That's good.

26:31.456 --> 26:33.725
Darkness should give
us cover until morning.

26:35.927 --> 26:37.596
- We can't be out here at night.

26:39.064 --> 26:44.135
There's bears and mountain
lions, and probably wolves.

26:45.170 --> 26:46.671
I don't know,
I don't like the dark.

26:46.671 --> 26:48.406
Maybe we should just go back.

26:48.406 --> 26:51.343
- It's not the animals we
should be worried about.

26:51.343 --> 26:52.711
- Noah, we've been
out here forever

26:52.711 --> 26:54.312
and we're getting nowhere.

26:54.312 --> 26:55.680
- Patrick.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.449
There are backwoods
hiking trails

26:57.449 --> 26:59.684
that lead all the way
into the mountains.

26:59.684 --> 27:01.219
If we keep going
this way we're gonna

27:01.219 --> 27:03.922
hit one of those trails
and it's gonna take us out.

27:03.922 --> 27:05.991
But if we're gonna get
through this, you and I,

27:05.991 --> 27:07.926
we need to work together.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.395
And it is safer here
than it is back there,

27:10.395 --> 27:11.630
I can promise you that.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.033
- Perspective.

28:02.981 --> 28:05.083
- Hey, what the hell?

28:05.083 --> 28:07.152
- I'm trying to listen
out for whoever the fuck

28:07.152 --> 28:09.254
is following us while
you're sitting on your ass

28:09.254 --> 28:11.690
making noise like
we're playing house.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.693
- You get angry,
I shuffle cards.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.961
We all cope with stress
differently.

28:16.961 --> 28:18.229
- Fuck!

28:18.229 --> 28:20.532
- What?

28:20.532 --> 28:22.901
All I wanted to do today
was get my dick sucked,

28:22.901 --> 28:25.937
and now we're being chased
through wherever the fuck we are

28:25.937 --> 28:28.306
by some psychopaths
that you pissed off!

28:30.575 --> 28:32.377
- Have you ever been
on a road trip?

28:32.377 --> 28:35.080
- What does that
have to do with anything?

28:35.080 --> 28:38.850
- When I was a kid, my
family, we went on a road trip

28:38.850 --> 28:40.085
to Wisconsin Dells.

28:41.619 --> 28:43.388
On the way back
we got a flat tire

28:43.388 --> 28:45.957
and we didn't have a spare,
so somebody had to go back

28:45.957 --> 28:49.194
the couple of miles to the
last town that we went through.

28:49.194 --> 28:52.263
And my dad, he hurt his knee
really bad in the wave pool,

28:52.263 --> 28:56.067
so my brother and I, we
volunteered.

28:58.970 --> 29:01.740
But the only thing that we
had was this old tricycle

29:01.740 --> 29:04.175
in the trunk of our car
that my dad kept forgetting

29:04.175 --> 29:05.076
to donate.

29:06.044 --> 29:08.780
So my big brother and I,
we got on that tricycle

29:08.780 --> 29:11.449
and we rode those five miles
back to town.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.255
It was the happiest
I have ever been.

29:20.625 --> 29:22.127
- Who the fuck cares?

29:29.601 --> 29:34.239
- The point is that whenever
anybody talked about that trip

29:34.239 --> 29:36.174
the only thing that
they talked about

29:36.174 --> 29:38.777
was my big brother and
me contorting ourselves

29:38.777 --> 29:40.979
onto that tricycle and
riding back to town.

29:43.815 --> 29:46.117
Made that trip unforgettable.

29:48.553 --> 29:50.355
Why fight against what could be

29:50.355 --> 29:51.990
a defining moment in your life?

30:03.902 --> 30:06.137
This is my brother, Michael.

30:07.005 --> 30:09.073
He used to come up here a lot.

30:09.073 --> 30:10.475
Ever met him?

30:10.475 --> 30:13.478
- No, I don't know him, and
frankly I don't give a shit

30:13.478 --> 30:15.380
about your family
or your stories.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.915
I just wanna get out of here.

30:20.251 --> 30:21.219
- Okay then.

30:24.556 --> 30:25.790
Did you hear that?

30:44.275 --> 30:47.078
How much longer till we
hit one of those trails?

30:47.078 --> 30:48.479
- I don't know.

30:48.479 --> 30:50.915
Could be 10 minutes, or
it could be two hours.

30:52.817 --> 30:56.087
I mean, we can always stay out
here

30:56.087 --> 30:57.555
and then just go back
when the sun comes up.

30:57.555 --> 30:58.990
When the
sun comes up?

30:58.990 --> 31:00.558
Fuck that, we keep moving.

31:03.194 --> 31:04.329
- Whatever you say.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.856
You really don't
like the dark, do you?

31:31.856 --> 31:33.391
- No, I don't, okay?

31:34.392 --> 31:35.560
Why?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.829
- The faster we go the
quicker we get there.

32:25.743 --> 32:27.545
- Hey, what's that?

32:27.545 --> 32:29.547
Noah, come
on, we gotta keep going.

32:30.481 --> 32:32.817
It's a baby bird,
it's injured, we gotta help it.

32:32.817 --> 32:34.319
Kill it.

32:34.319 --> 32:36.254
- What is wrong with you?

32:36.254 --> 32:38.222
You'd leave
it out here to suffer?

32:38.222 --> 32:40.658
That's fucked up, cruel.

32:44.162 --> 32:44.996
See?

32:44.996 --> 32:46.597
I put it out of its misery.

32:46.597 --> 32:47.498
Now let's go.

32:51.035 --> 32:52.203
Noah, you have to keep quiet.

32:53.237 --> 32:55.006
Calm down or they'll hear you.

32:56.674 --> 32:59.644
Okay Noah, you have to
breathe through this.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.947
Noah, listen to me, listen
to the sound of my voice.

33:02.947 --> 33:05.650
Slow, deep breaths
in through your nose,

33:05.650 --> 33:07.885
hold it, and release
through your mouth,

33:07.885 --> 33:09.053
I know what I'm talking about,

33:09.053 --> 33:10.588
I deal with this all
the time at work.

33:10.588 --> 33:11.923
Put your arms above your head.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.958
This always helps
me with my asthma.

33:13.958 --> 33:15.393
Putting your arms
above your head

33:15.393 --> 33:17.428
allows more air to
get into your lungs.

33:18.296 --> 33:20.999
Slow, deep breaths
in through your nose,

33:20.999 --> 33:24.836
hold it for four,
two, three, four,

33:24.836 --> 33:28.840
and release it on
eight, two, three, four.

33:29.607 --> 33:33.778
Hold it, two, three, four,
release.

33:34.912 --> 33:36.681
Focus on the sound
of your breath.

34:32.770 --> 34:33.670
Hey.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.744
You wanna tell me
what that was all about?

34:46.284 --> 34:50.888
Are you sure we're still
going in the right direction?

34:50.888 --> 34:53.958
How about if I hold onto the
compass for a little while?

34:53.958 --> 34:54.891
Noah.

34:54.891 --> 34:56.094
- Don't touch me.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.528
- Oh, relax.

34:57.528 --> 35:00.431
It was gonna die anyway, I did
it a favor.

35:00.431 --> 35:04.368
- It's not your decision to
make about what lives or dies.

35:04.368 --> 35:08.806
Yeah, it may have been injured,
but it could've been saved.

35:08.806 --> 35:11.142
- I think we're the ones who
needs to be saved right now,

35:11.142 --> 35:12.410
not a fucking bird.

35:13.277 --> 35:16.681
Okay, I've been really
nice about all this,

35:16.681 --> 35:18.182
but I'm gonna
give you five seconds

35:18.182 --> 35:19.283
for you to take
your hands off me

35:19.283 --> 35:21.319
or I'm gonna knock your ass out.

35:27.658 --> 35:28.893
What the fuck?

35:29.961 --> 35:32.797
You swung a knife at my head.

35:35.066 --> 35:36.167
- Brown recluse.

35:42.573 --> 35:44.308
Simple thank you would suffice.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.615
- Where'd you get that knife?

35:50.615 --> 35:52.150
- My brother gave it to me, why?

35:52.150 --> 35:53.384
- Because it's mine.

35:53.384 --> 35:54.218
- No it isn't.

35:54.218 --> 35:55.486
- Yeah, it is, I can prove it,

35:55.486 --> 35:57.054
there's a D on the base of it.

35:59.056 --> 36:00.158
See?

36:00.158 --> 36:01.592
It's mine,
now give it back to me.

36:01.592 --> 36:02.593
- Well if you didn't
know my brother

36:02.593 --> 36:06.397
- It probably fell out of my
bag along the trail somewhere.

36:06.397 --> 36:07.899
- Bullshit.

36:07.899 --> 36:10.735
- No I didn't, you asked
if I knew him, I don't.

36:10.735 --> 36:12.870
- No no no, I asked if
you'd met him,

36:12.870 --> 36:13.704
you said you didn't know him.

36:13.704 --> 36:14.839
- Semantics.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.340
We hooked up once, all right?

36:16.340 --> 36:17.942
And he probably
stole it from me.

36:17.942 --> 36:19.076
Now give it back.

36:23.614 --> 36:24.515
- You're a liar.

37:05.523 --> 37:07.758
Come on, this way.

37:10.194 --> 37:11.095
Anything?

37:11.862 --> 37:12.797
- No.

37:12.797 --> 37:14.665
I heard footsteps,
anything your way?

37:14.665 --> 37:15.566
Not sure.

37:15.566 --> 37:16.634
- All right.

37:18.035 --> 37:19.003
Go.

37:19.003 --> 37:20.438
Fuck.

37:20.438 --> 37:21.339
Fuck!

37:34.185 --> 37:36.320
- Not until they're gone.

37:40.424 --> 37:43.828
I can't believe they're still
following.

38:27.338 --> 38:29.006
I gotta
get outta here.

38:29.006 --> 38:30.908
It's gonna get dark soon.

38:30.908 --> 38:32.643
Good luck with that.

38:32.643 --> 38:33.978
- I say if we
haven't hit a trail

38:33.978 --> 38:35.813
in the next 30
minutes we go back.

38:48.526 --> 38:51.562
- My brother and I used to
play a game to pass the time.

38:51.562 --> 38:53.731
If you were
stranded on a desert island,

38:53.731 --> 38:54.932
what would you bring?

38:54.932 --> 38:56.167
- A boat.

38:58.502 --> 38:59.870
- We never thought of that.

38:59.870 --> 39:01.172
- And you?

39:01.172 --> 39:02.540
- My soulmate.

39:03.641 --> 39:05.109
What do you have against love?

39:05.109 --> 39:06.377
- It isn't real.

39:06.377 --> 39:09.513
Love is a concept, it
doesn't actually exist.

39:10.715 --> 39:13.451
- So you really don't
think that love can exist

39:13.451 --> 39:15.086
between two people?

39:15.086 --> 39:17.555
- Why is it that in nature,
no animals stay together

39:17.555 --> 39:18.689
after they fuck?

39:19.623 --> 39:24.228
- That's because they're programmed that way,
by instinct.

39:24.228 --> 39:26.897
If human beings were, then
they'd do it automatically.

39:26.897 --> 39:31.902
But no, we get divorced, and
cheat, and hurt each other.

39:32.770 --> 39:35.139
We're constantly going
against our own nature.

39:36.073 --> 39:37.742
- Sounds a little cynical.

39:37.742 --> 39:40.010
- And you sound a little naive.

39:40.010 --> 39:41.846
Besides, I'm not
a fucking penguin.

39:43.581 --> 39:45.583
- We also have a much more
complex brain

39:45.583 --> 39:48.219
which allows us to choose.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.188
I mean, you can't really
compare free will to instinct.

39:52.757 --> 39:54.925
- What are you trying to do?

39:55.793 --> 39:57.828
- I'm not following.

39:57.828 --> 40:00.231
- Whatever you're looking
for, I'm not into it.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.767
Let's just get outta here.

40:04.368 --> 40:06.737
- I thought we were just
sharing our opinions.

40:07.638 --> 40:11.475
Because it seems like you're
judging me for my opinion.

40:11.475 --> 40:13.177
You would see it
that way, wouldn't you?

40:13.177 --> 40:15.279
- Oh, fuck off.

40:15.279 --> 40:16.947
- You fuck off.

40:54.318 --> 40:55.252
What?

40:55.252 --> 41:00.324
- Listen.

41:01.091 --> 41:01.992
Water.

41:04.795 --> 41:06.230
That has to lead someplace.

41:31.021 --> 41:32.523
- This isn't a good idea.

41:32.523 --> 41:33.457
- Well you're more than welcome

41:33.457 --> 41:34.792
to follow that shitty compass,

41:34.792 --> 41:37.027
but I'm getting
the fuck outta here.

41:37.027 --> 41:39.497
- The only way that we're gonna
know that they're close by

41:39.497 --> 41:41.732
is if we can hear them coming.

41:41.732 --> 41:44.401
We're never gonna hear 'em
coming if we're by the river.

41:44.401 --> 41:45.569
- Okay.

41:45.569 --> 41:46.904
Then what do you suggest?

41:48.372 --> 41:51.308
- Why don't we just push up
into the woods a little ways,

41:51.308 --> 41:53.310
we'll get up far enough so that
we can still hear the river

41:53.310 --> 41:55.279
but we can also hear 'em coming.

41:55.279 --> 41:57.715
And we'll just follow
the river out from there.

41:58.816 --> 42:00.117
- After you.

42:10.828 --> 42:13.030
Are you an only child?

42:13.030 --> 42:13.931
Why?

42:15.199 --> 42:17.268
Just seems like it.

42:17.268 --> 42:18.168
- Maybe.

42:18.969 --> 42:20.571
What are you implying?

42:20.571 --> 42:24.308
- Can we just focus on
getting out of here?

42:24.308 --> 42:26.010
- Sorry, I just thought, you
know, once we hit the river

42:26.010 --> 42:28.012
you might lighten up,
even be friendly.

42:35.853 --> 42:37.221
- What are you looking for?

42:39.323 --> 42:40.224
- My pills.

42:41.592 --> 42:43.827
I thought I put 'em
in the side pocket.

42:43.827 --> 42:45.462
- What kind of pills?

42:45.462 --> 42:47.898
- Anxiety pills for my--

42:47.898 --> 42:48.799
- Anxiety?

42:52.870 --> 42:54.371
You're not gonna find 'em.

42:55.339 --> 42:56.273
I threw 'em out.

42:57.141 --> 42:58.742
- You what?

42:58.742 --> 42:59.877
- Dude, relax.

42:59.877 --> 43:01.378
Why would you do that?

43:01.378 --> 43:02.780
- Be calm, relax.

43:02.780 --> 43:04.682
- Dude, what the
fuck is wrong with you?

43:04.682 --> 43:06.283
- I'm sorry, all right?

43:06.283 --> 43:08.619
I saw them in your bag
and I threw them out.

43:08.619 --> 43:10.154
- Why would you do that?

43:12.489 --> 43:15.960
- My mom got hooked
on those things, okay?

43:15.960 --> 43:17.995
I was a kid, she took too many,

43:17.995 --> 43:20.497
I came home from school
one day and she was dead.

43:23.867 --> 43:24.768
I'm sorry.

43:28.405 --> 43:30.207
And I didn't think
you needed them.

43:32.109 --> 43:33.444
I mean, you didn't, right?

43:35.279 --> 43:37.548
You got through it, right?

43:41.485 --> 43:45.956
- Touch my stuff again,
and I'll fuckin' kill you.

44:32.069 --> 44:34.038
Hey, over here.

44:40.978 --> 44:42.980
You can't hide from us!

44:48.385 --> 44:49.620
Where are you!

45:08.305 --> 45:10.240
- If they find us
in here we're dead.

45:33.464 --> 45:34.765
- They hear us?

45:37.401 --> 45:38.736
- I don't know.

46:18.308 --> 46:19.710
It's gonna be dark soon.

46:21.712 --> 46:24.448
- Good, then at least
we're safe until morning.

46:25.649 --> 46:27.384
- I'm not staying
here all night.

46:34.558 --> 46:35.959
- Is that really necessary?

46:37.828 --> 46:40.397
- Well they're not
trying to suck our dicks.

46:40.397 --> 46:42.733
So we need to be
ready if they come back.

46:50.974 --> 46:51.942
I say let's give it
some time and then

46:51.942 --> 46:54.211
try to make it
back to the river.

46:54.211 --> 46:58.282
- Patrick, staying in here
is the safest place to be.

46:58.282 --> 46:59.750
Running blindly
out into the night,

46:59.750 --> 47:01.385
that's only gonna get us killed.

47:04.721 --> 47:06.523
- Do you have a flashlight?

47:06.523 --> 47:07.658
- No, I don't.

47:07.658 --> 47:09.326
- What if this is an animal den?

47:11.061 --> 47:12.963
- This isn't an animal den.

47:13.730 --> 47:15.699
If it was, there would be bones.

47:32.249 --> 47:33.150
Better?

47:43.427 --> 47:44.595
Hell of a day, huh?

47:58.342 --> 48:01.712
- I'm sorry I threw out
your pills, that was stupid.

48:04.848 --> 48:05.749
- Forget it.

48:08.852 --> 48:11.755
So much for your one dot limit
out here with people, huh?

48:12.823 --> 48:15.259
- You're really enjoying
yourself, aren't you?

48:18.128 --> 48:21.198
- I'm enjoying being
in here, away from them

48:21.198 --> 48:22.332
out there, yeah.

48:23.567 --> 48:25.068
As much as I can, anyway.

48:27.004 --> 48:28.906
- Well, I mean out
here in the woods.

48:30.007 --> 48:33.043
- I prefer being in the woods
to being around people, yeah.

48:34.244 --> 48:35.145
Why?

48:39.950 --> 48:42.252
- I feel safe in the woods.

48:43.820 --> 48:45.555
I don't feel safe around people.

48:47.624 --> 48:52.696
My experience, people
are the root of all evil.

48:55.899 --> 48:57.634
- Can't argue there.

49:17.254 --> 49:19.923
Tell me something
that no one knows about you.

49:21.258 --> 49:22.192
- Why?

49:24.428 --> 49:25.395
- Pass the time.

49:28.865 --> 49:32.069
- When I was a kid, my mom
used to lock me in the closet

49:32.069 --> 49:34.771
whenever she had
one of her crazy spells.

49:39.676 --> 49:41.445
That's why I'm
afraid of the dark.

49:57.294 --> 49:58.328
How about you?

50:03.400 --> 50:05.168
- I killed someone once.

50:05.168 --> 50:06.069
- Bullshit.

50:06.937 --> 50:07.838
Who?

50:09.439 --> 50:10.340
- My uncle.

50:15.045 --> 50:15.946
- Okay.

50:17.280 --> 50:18.515
I'm listening.

50:21.518 --> 50:23.820
- 'Cause he tried
to kill my brother.

50:29.493 --> 50:32.329
- Did you shoot him or
something?

50:34.531 --> 50:35.699
- I beat him to death.

50:43.473 --> 50:45.142
- What happened after?

50:46.309 --> 50:47.944
- What do you mean?

50:49.179 --> 50:51.214
- I mean, did you go to jail?

50:53.583 --> 50:54.518
- My brother did.

50:56.319 --> 50:58.288
He told the police
that he did it.

51:04.961 --> 51:07.364
- What did your parents say?

51:08.365 --> 51:11.368
- My parents died a couple
years earlier in a car accident.

51:12.369 --> 51:14.104
My uncle was our
only living relative,

51:14.104 --> 51:17.240
so we had to go live with him.

51:18.875 --> 51:20.077
- What happened to you?

51:22.312 --> 51:23.814
- I was 13.

51:23.814 --> 51:25.582
They sent me to a
mental hospital.

51:29.853 --> 51:31.421
- How long were you there for?

51:34.224 --> 51:35.192
- Until this year.

51:41.465 --> 51:45.102
My brother came and got me
out when he got out of prison.

51:48.905 --> 51:51.441
You know, they never told
me that I could leave

51:51.441 --> 51:52.375
when I turned 18.

51:58.949 --> 52:00.016
I gotta pee.

52:01.084 --> 52:02.252
- Right now?

52:02.252 --> 52:03.653
What about them?

52:06.156 --> 52:07.557
- I'll be quiet.

52:13.864 --> 52:14.931
Don't worry.

53:34.578 --> 53:36.746
- It's about time.

53:46.022 --> 53:47.824
- So what were
you looking for now?

53:49.059 --> 53:49.960
- Huh?

53:51.428 --> 53:52.629
- In my bag.

53:52.629 --> 53:53.964
What were you looking for?

53:55.265 --> 53:56.199
- Flashlight.

53:58.335 --> 53:59.636
- I told you I didn't have one.

53:59.636 --> 54:01.238
- Yeah, well you
could've been lying.

54:04.074 --> 54:05.242
- Why would I do that?

54:07.777 --> 54:08.678
- I don't know.

54:11.982 --> 54:14.050
- You're the one
who hasn't been honest.

54:22.259 --> 54:24.761
Go ahead, look in my bag.

54:28.898 --> 54:29.966
- No, I believe you.

54:31.601 --> 54:34.704
- I said look in my bag.

54:40.277 --> 54:44.247
- I think maybe we should
just get out of here.

54:45.282 --> 54:46.516
- I'll make you a deal.

54:47.684 --> 54:49.419
I'll get you out of here
safe and sound tonight

54:49.419 --> 54:50.820
if you do something for me.

54:52.155 --> 54:53.423
- What do you mean?

54:54.891 --> 54:58.028
- I mean I'm willing to
risk my life for yours

54:58.828 --> 55:00.263
if you do something for me.

55:03.566 --> 55:04.834
- Okay.

55:04.834 --> 55:05.735
Deal.

55:08.138 --> 55:09.773
- Tell me where my brother is.

55:10.874 --> 55:12.809
- What are you talking about?

55:12.809 --> 55:15.011
- Stop the bullshit.

55:17.113 --> 55:18.648
He went missing out here.

55:18.648 --> 55:20.283
Tell me where he is.

55:20.283 --> 55:22.018
- I don't know
where your brother is.

55:22.018 --> 55:24.521
I told you, we messed
around, that's it.

55:44.107 --> 55:47.610
- This is what
you want, isn't it?

55:47.610 --> 55:48.545
Stop.

55:49.446 --> 55:50.413
I'll give you
what you want.

55:50.413 --> 55:51.314
- Stop.

55:54.117 --> 55:55.018
- Please.

55:56.820 --> 55:57.954
I'll do anything.

55:59.022 --> 56:00.790
Just tell me where he is.

56:07.597 --> 56:10.100
- I don't know where
your fucking brother is.

56:15.004 --> 56:19.275
- He came back
one night with that knife.

56:21.745 --> 56:23.580
He told me he
found it in the park.

56:26.216 --> 56:27.684
But I knew he was lying.

56:30.520 --> 56:32.222
I thought he was stealing.

56:33.823 --> 56:35.825
I didn't want him
to go back to prison.

56:42.298 --> 56:43.500
So I followed him.

57:12.462 --> 57:14.097
I saw you together.

58:06.349 --> 58:08.485
He left his cards behind.

58:09.953 --> 58:11.287
He'd never do that.

58:12.789 --> 58:14.057
Took them everywhere.

58:15.358 --> 58:18.795
We found those cards
together when we were kids.

58:20.296 --> 58:23.132
He wouldn't leave them behind.

58:23.132 --> 58:24.033
Michael!

58:28.771 --> 58:29.672
Michael!

58:35.011 --> 58:37.547
And that's when I knew
that something bad happened

58:37.547 --> 58:38.448
on that trail.

58:38.448 --> 58:42.986
And you were the last person
with him before he disappeared.

58:42.986 --> 58:45.455
- Whatever you think
happened to your brother,

58:45.455 --> 58:47.123
I had nothing to do with it!

59:03.273 --> 59:04.340
- Hey, give me that.

59:05.708 --> 59:08.411
- You think this is love, Noah?

59:08.411 --> 59:10.280
This is some fucked up shit.

59:20.390 --> 59:22.959
- You don't get to
decide what love is,

59:22.959 --> 59:24.594
especially when it's something
that you're

59:24.594 --> 59:25.662
not even capable of.

59:27.263 --> 59:29.999
You wanna know
what happened to my back?

59:29.999 --> 59:33.169
My uncle used us as his
own personal whipping bench

59:33.169 --> 59:34.771
and punching bag.

59:34.771 --> 59:38.207
He kept us locked in the
basement in a dog cage

59:38.207 --> 59:40.410
and fed us slop, sometimes
nothing at all.

59:41.477 --> 59:43.546
We had to sleep in our own piss

59:44.447 --> 59:47.283
while he spent every dime
that my parents ever made.

59:49.218 --> 59:54.190
My brother is the only reason
that I didn't give up hope.

59:54.190 --> 59:56.859
When you go through
something like that,

59:56.859 --> 59:59.329
you develop an unbreakable bond.

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:03.733
That is love, Patrick.

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:05.969
A love that crosses all
boundaries.

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:08.571
And it is real,

01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:09.606
and pure,

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.041
and beautiful.

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:17.213
'Cause I'm not the one
who's out here taking

01:00:17.213 --> 01:00:20.083
and taking and taking and
taking and never giving back,

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:23.252
because the only thing that
you care about is yourself.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.788
That's fucked up.

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:27.890
You're just like him.

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:32.629
And I know that my brother
wasn't the only one.

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:34.998
Because I saw you
with that other guy

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:36.733
right before he
went missing too.

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:40.737
Remember, I like to watch.

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:45.008
- That guy was
just another trick!

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:47.210
- Tell me where
my brother's body is

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:51.047
or I swear on his life I will
take yours.

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:53.483
- Okay!

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:01.157
Let's go.

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:13.082
- Hey.

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:14.984
Where the fuck you
think you're going, huh?

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:18.487
- Where's the guy you jumped?

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:19.622
- What?

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:20.523
- That his blood?

01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:27.830
We caught you, you fuckin'
homophobic piece of shit!

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.682
- Oh my god, you okay?

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:10.673
- You killed them.

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:16.312
- It was them or me.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:20.249
He said something
that I jumped a guy.

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:24.854
- That would've been me.

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:42.505
- Whoa!

01:05:42.505 --> 01:05:43.406
Hey.

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:45.274
Are you all right?

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:48.978
- That guy, that guy that
I was with, he attacked me.

01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:50.513
I think he's the one who's
attacking people out here,

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:52.214
please, you gotta get help.

01:05:52.214 --> 01:05:53.616
You gotta get help,
I'm gonna hide,

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.217
you gotta get help, please.

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:02.124
- You made them
think I attacked you?

01:06:03.726 --> 01:06:05.094
- I had to.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:09.799
You were gonna go
off with that other guy.

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:13.970
I needed more time with you.

01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:17.273
- You're crazy.

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:18.808
Seriously fucked up!

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:23.379
- Was it an accident?

01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:26.082
Like him?

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:40.963
I will let you walk
outta here right now.

01:06:40.963 --> 01:06:43.833
Just tell me what
happened to my brother!

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:11.279
Did you lose something?

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:28.296
I've given you every opportunity
to admit to what you did.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.669
And you just keep lying.

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:36.705
Daryl?

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:39.975
You left your
wallet in your bag.

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:54.122
Someone once told me that

01:09:57.593 --> 01:10:01.864
it'd be cruel, or fucked up,

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:06.001
to leave something
out here to suffer.

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:43.305
I'm gonna find him.

01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:50.279
Whether it takes days,
weeks, months, even years.

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.486
I will never give up.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:57.272
I got you.

01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:03.312
I got you.

01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:11.887
I got you, bro.

01:15:10.205 --> 01:15:11.106
Goodbye.

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:43.725
What happened to him?

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:45.327
- He showed up.

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:47.663
Turns out he just ran
off with his boyfriend.

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:54.670
Probably can't say
the same for him.

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:11.420
- I'm sure he'll show up.

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:14.489
- Right.

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:45.053
Trail up ahead's closed.

01:18:56.798 --> 01:18:58.233
Noah.

01:18:58.233 --> 01:19:00.368
I'm so sorry that it
had to be this way.

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:05.907
I wanted it to
be different, I really did.

01:19:07.976 --> 01:19:11.246
You waited all those years
for me only to let you down.

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:15.117
I want you to
know that I don't regret

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:16.351
going to prison for you.

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:20.789
In fact, it was
my proudest moment.

01:19:22.891 --> 01:19:25.494
All I ever wanted in this
world was to protect you.

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:28.864
When you saw me with that guy,

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:33.802
yes, I saw you too.

01:19:35.704 --> 01:19:37.706
I saw the pain I caused you.

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:41.376
It broke my heart.

01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:44.613
That's when I knew

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:50.418
I had to give up my life so
that I wouldn't screw up yours.

01:19:52.687 --> 01:19:54.656
That's why I left those cards
for you,

01:19:56.057 --> 01:20:00.662
hoping you'd find them to
remember me by.

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:04.699
Those cards were all we
had when we were kids.

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:08.737
They always seemed to help us
when we

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:09.638
couldn't help each other.

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:14.176
I want so many
things for you, Noah.

01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:17.946
You can have a beautiful life.

01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:21.950
You were so much
stronger than I ever was.

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:25.187
You never lost hope.

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:29.558
Please know that I
wasn't alone in the end,

01:20:30.425 --> 01:20:31.660
and I wasn't afraid.

01:20:33.461 --> 01:20:35.096
I had you right here with me.

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:40.969
Thinking of you and I riding
that tricycle down that empty,

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:44.439
open road towards that
perfect fire-orange sunset,

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:49.444
wind in our hair,
smiles on our faces,

01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:53.315
and love in my heart.

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:56.751
Please forgive me, Noah.

01:20:58.854 --> 01:20:59.754
I love you.

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:02.791
My brother.

01:21:04.726 --> 01:21:05.660
My soulmate.

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:37.125
- How is it that
a stupid little pebble

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:37.626
can cause so much pain?

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:44.366
- It's 'cause you're putting
all your weight on it

01:21:44.366 --> 01:21:45.734
with every step you take.

01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:50.972
- That was a rhetorical
question.

01:21:57.245 --> 01:21:59.014
Are those tarot cards?

01:21:59.014 --> 01:21:59.915
- Yeah.

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:05.053
- What are you, some new
agey weirdo or something?

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:09.324
- No.

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:10.225
Not anymore.

01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:17.699
Somebody really special gave
these to me.

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:18.833
- Hmm.

01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:19.734
I'm Steve.

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:22.170
- I'm Noah.

01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:25.373
It's really nice to meet you,
Steve.

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:36.184
- What am I supposed to do?

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:38.887
- Just pick a card.

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:45.894
Is this good?

01:22:47.762 --> 01:22:48.964
- Depends.

01:22:50.832 --> 01:22:52.000
Keep it, keep it.

01:22:58.106 --> 01:22:59.074
- Just moved here.

01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:02.544
Really love the nature.

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:05.013
What about you?

01:23:07.182 --> 01:23:08.483
- I used to.

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:17.158
Nature, for me, it used
to be like home, safe.

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:24.032
But now it's just another
reminder.

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:29.971
- Hmm?

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:30.939
Oh yeah, man, me too.

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:32.807
Love it out here.

01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:40.048
- That you'll never belong
anywhere.

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:44.452
- Bright day, sunny sky,
beautiful.

01:23:46.888 --> 01:23:49.024
- Or with anyone.

01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:51.726
- Yeah man, for sure.

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:56.031
- That you'll never
really be able to live.

01:23:58.133 --> 01:23:59.234
Just survive.

01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:06.041
That you've become so broken
that you've allowed yourself

01:24:07.609 --> 01:24:10.345
to become exactly what you hate.

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:16.317
- Yep, gotta love the nature.

01:24:18.987 --> 01:24:21.990
Hey, I'm gonna catch a friend.

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:23.191
Nice to meet you, Neil.

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:27.796
- A monster.
