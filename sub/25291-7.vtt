WEBVTT

01:02.400 --> 01:03.981
(She giggles)

01:04.160 --> 01:06.299
You are worse than the children!

01:08.080 --> 01:09.707
D'you wish they were here?

01:10.640 --> 01:12.904
- Not at this precise moment, no.
- (Laughs)

01:14.640 --> 01:18.189
And, at this rate...
we'll soon be adding to their number.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.739
(She giggles)

01:37.240 --> 01:39.617
(Chuckling)

01:43.320 --> 01:45.299
(Lively chatter)

02:24.600 --> 02:27.740
Everyone is at your beck and call -
myself included.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.229
My love, the confinement is months away.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.267
And I intend to lavish
the best possible care upon you.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.420
And as for this young man...

02:37.240 --> 02:39.879
Come and meet Aurelia!

02:40.040 --> 02:41.746
Oh, Papa, thank you!

02:41.920 --> 02:43.626
OK. Ready?

02:43.800 --> 02:45.779
(They chuckle)

02:48.600 --> 02:50.818
I also have a surprise for you.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.025
And what might that be?

02:54.160 --> 02:57.266
A masked ball, in this house,

02:57.440 --> 03:00.944
to which the cream
of London society will flock.

03:01.680 --> 03:04.137
My dear, recollect how many times
your invitations

03:04.320 --> 03:06.140
have not found the favour they deserve.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.584
Now they have.
This will be a charity ball.

03:08.760 --> 03:10.546
In aid of the foundling hospital.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.859
- Oh! I see.
- (He chuckles)

03:13.040 --> 03:14.382
Well, in that case...

03:14.560 --> 03:18.701
Could there be a better way
of announcing our return to London?

03:18.880 --> 03:20.939
(George chuckles)

03:21.920 --> 03:23.467
- Faster.
- (Chuckling)

03:23.640 --> 03:25.187
(Tiny explosions)

03:25.360 --> 03:27.624
(Gasps of amazement)

03:29.440 --> 03:32.022
- Now, for my next trick...
- (Lively chatter)

03:32.200 --> 03:34.100
(Bird chattering)

03:48.480 --> 03:50.664
First thing tomorrow
we will visit your tailor.

03:50.840 --> 03:53.217
- I have no tailor.
- I've engaged one.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.061
- The finest.
- Naturally.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.105
My love, this is London.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.942
- One is required to look the part.
- What part is that?

04:00.120 --> 04:02.680
One half of the handsomest couple in town?

04:04.920 --> 04:07.423
No wonder you stay so long in London.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.026
Life's all pleasure!

04:12.120 --> 04:14.941
ROSS: Excellent! A charity ball.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.103
Guess George is 'spiring for sainthood now.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.986
Are we to go?

04:25.640 --> 04:28.939
Would you deprive him the pleasure
of taking money from us?

04:31.360 --> 04:34.579
Oh, Lord, I'm so tired
I could sleep for a week.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.099
What if I have other plans for you?

04:53.600 --> 04:55.579
(Waves crashing)

05:08.560 --> 05:10.983
Granted, it don't look like much now.

05:11.160 --> 05:15.347
But there's a stream close by an'...
Sawle 'ave need of a blacksmith.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.579
(Scoffs) This blacksmith?

05:18.360 --> 05:20.339
All in good time.

05:21.960 --> 05:25.259
Cap'n Ross did once say:
"Work is the thing.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.227
Not drink, not despair.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.857
But build a thing, mend a thing...

05:31.040 --> 05:35.943
an' even if there's hell in your heart,
at the end of the day, ye'll feel better."

05:36.120 --> 05:37.587
So let's build.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.702
My daughter-in-law has always been unstable.

05:47.800 --> 05:51.224
Lately she has become more erratic than ever,

05:51.400 --> 05:55.029
and...l must tell you, I fear for the children.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.337
You agree it will be best for all concerned

05:59.520 --> 06:02.626
that when the child is born
she be removed from this house

06:02.800 --> 06:05.018
and committed to an asylum?

06:05.200 --> 06:07.509
Yes, Your Ladyship.

06:12.320 --> 06:15.426
I was saying to Dr Behenna,
we must hope for a boy.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.459
Girls are of no use to anyone.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.506
I wonder if you realise
how fortunate you are?

06:25.600 --> 06:29.422
Without the kindness of the Whitworths,
you'd be nothing but a common governess.

06:30.680 --> 06:34.309
And I was never in my life more happy
than when I was a governess.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.662
London suits you.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.343
- (They laugh)
CAROLINE: And will shortly be at your feet.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.865
Tomorrow, the Warleggan party.
Have you decided what you'll wear?

06:57.680 --> 07:00.240
My best gown.
The one I wore to your wedding.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.186
Oh, that won't do at all.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.737
Don't despair, I have a solution.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.426
I mean to have you worshipped
by all who set eyes on you.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.784
Oh, I don't think I'd like that.

07:10.960 --> 07:14.339
My clear, we both know it happens
whether you like it or not!

07:14.520 --> 07:16.499
(Chatter)

07:27.800 --> 07:29.461
That's a very pretty petticoat!

07:29.640 --> 07:31.699
Should I wear my nightshirt
to keep you company?

07:31.880 --> 07:34.519
Oh, Ross, don't tease me!
Caroline had it altered for me.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.467
D'you really hate it?
Should I wear my old gown instead?

07:37.640 --> 07:39.380
And be miserable all night?

07:42.800 --> 07:44.939
I could never be miserable.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.747
You know how happy I am.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.980
- Why is that?
- Mm... Because of you.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.740
Because of us.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.985
How it's been since we came to London.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.260
Perhaps you'd consider a longer stay?

08:00.440 --> 08:03.500
We could send for the children
and find more spacious lodgings.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.864
- Oh, Ross, d'you really mean it?
- Yes.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.224
I'd like it beyond anything!

08:09.680 --> 08:11.898
And, for what it's worth...

08:13.640 --> 08:15.619
...I like the gown.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.667
DRIVER: Whoa!

08:22.840 --> 08:25.149
MAN: The Honourable Miss Dullevan.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.185
(Chatter and laughter)

08:27.360 --> 08:29.021
Ma'am.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.342
Sir.

08:31.520 --> 08:32.737
(Demelza laughs)

08:32.920 --> 08:35.024
(Music and chatter)

08:36.320 --> 08:39.585
Captain and Mrs Poldark.

08:44.800 --> 08:49.464
Well, he could have saved himself the expense
and donated it all to charity.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.779
But that would defeat the object.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.622
Demelza. You look wonderful.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.542
Admiral and Mrs Banister.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.505
You must be glad
to have her with you at last.

09:03.680 --> 09:05.147
Yes.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.345
You couldn't know...

09:11.520 --> 09:14.978
I scarcely knew myself at the time but...

09:16.120 --> 09:19.942
In the aftermath of...a certain event,

09:20.120 --> 09:23.942
I thought to put distance
between myself and Demelza.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.985
To try to make sense of it all.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.661
And did you?

09:28.360 --> 09:29.748
In part.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.142
But distance creates
as many problems as It solves.

09:33.320 --> 09:34.901
Don't I know it!

09:36.640 --> 09:40.667
And now, I think, what will serve us better,
is to spend more time together.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.104
So despite everything, here we are...

09:43.280 --> 09:45.100
You know how she loves a party.

09:45.960 --> 09:51.341
Oh, the foundling hospital has long been
clear to my heart - and my wife's, of course.

09:51.520 --> 09:55.627
Everyone thinks of those poor,
fatherless, abandoned infants.

09:55.800 --> 09:59.224
- Elizabeth is with child?
- Had you not heard?

09:59.400 --> 10:01.300
Of course. Why would you?

10:02.120 --> 10:03.508
DEMELZA: Who's that?

10:07.440 --> 10:10.989
My dear, you're a veritable goddess
and George is blessed amongst men.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.789
And, I assure you,
is entirely sensible of his good fortune.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.389
Whatever you do, do not take him seriously.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.621
Who's that with Poldark?

10:24.640 --> 10:28.383
His kitchen maid. Now his wife.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.342
The hair's a touch provincial,
but the rest is good.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.863
Doubtless she's been dressed in London.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.983
Then she must be undressed in London.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.739
Have you ventured yourself?

10:43.920 --> 10:46.662
Uh... My tastes are more refined.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.821
But if you have the stomach...

10:57.120 --> 10:58.781
(Chatter and music)

11:01.400 --> 11:03.220
Drommie, viens!

11:04.080 --> 11:06.139
There's a fellow I'd like you to meet.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.707
(Low chatter)

11:11.520 --> 11:13.499
My dear Poldark.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.982
May I present my ward,
Miss Andromeda Page.

11:17.160 --> 11:20.584
- Delighted.
- And this must be Mrs Poldark?

11:20.760 --> 11:23.320
- Enchant.
- Shall we...

11:24.120 --> 11:26.304
I'm as hungry as a cannibal.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.465
Shall we seek some refreshment?

11:29.640 --> 11:31.380
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, sir. I'm engaged.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.539
- To whom?
- My husband.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.142
(Laughs) on.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.538
My dear, let me advise you.

11:38.720 --> 11:42.542
It is simply not the thing in London
for married couples to eat together.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.302
Oh... I did... I did not know.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.786
Your husband knows the form.

11:49.640 --> 11:50.709
Ross.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.906
Captain Adderley seems ferocious for food.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.820
Shall we eat together?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.740
By all means.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.464
So, you find me ferocious?

12:03.200 --> 12:07.079
- Is it my reputation which alarms you?
- I don't know of your reputation, sir.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.060
Two things I like best.

12:09.240 --> 12:11.982
To fight and to make love.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.105
With the same person?

12:14.800 --> 12:17.542
No...but on the same day.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.383
One whets the appetite for the other.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.785
Bear up. It will soon be over.

12:24.960 --> 12:28.145
I assure you I'm having a splendid time.

12:28.880 --> 12:32.065
Not fearing for Mrs Coad's quinsy?
Or Nan Bartle's scarlet fever?

12:32.240 --> 12:33.980
My locum is an excellent man.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.903
Well, some of the tabbies have been doubting
I actually have a husband.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.106
I must be allowed to flaunt you
for all you're worth.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.903
Admiring my buttons?

12:56.080 --> 12:58.059
Observe in each a lock of hair.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.785
A token from Miss Page?

13:01.480 --> 13:03.459
A Lieutenant Framfield...

13:04.800 --> 13:06.301
...and a Captain Polger.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.857
Both despatched in a duel.

13:10.840 --> 13:13.627
- Mm.
- Of course there have been others.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.745
But one does not usually linger
to collect souvenirs.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.380
Is not the punishment
for duelling...hanging?

13:23.040 --> 13:24.621
I plead benefit of clergy.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.586
Are you a clergyman?

13:28.160 --> 13:31.857
A cleric. I read and write.

13:32.040 --> 13:35.669
Ah, here's Poldark, with my little Drommie.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.539
Delicious body.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.745
Drommie's, I mean.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.989
Though I venture POldark's
has much to recommend it?

13:46.160 --> 13:48.299
(She laughs)

13:49.400 --> 13:52.142
- Are you not afraid for your wife?
- Not in the least.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.379
She's a miner's daughter.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.620
- Lord, how mortifying!
- Not for me.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.104
I view her heritage with nothing but pride.

14:01.280 --> 14:04.226
But how can you be sure
she won't disgrace herself?

14:04.400 --> 14:06.345
Being one of the vulgars.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.579
Are we not all vulgars?

14:09.560 --> 14:14.020
Do we not all share the_ same needs...
hungers...palns?

14:14.200 --> 14:16.657
Just what my father would have said.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.819
But then he was a merchant.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.500
Challenged me to a duel once.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.786
I refused.
On the grounds that he wasn't a gentleman.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.178
(She laughs) Mm.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.180
Mrs Poldark, shall we take a turn?

14:33.520 --> 14:35.147
Yes, if you like.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.348
How are you, Demelza?

14:51.520 --> 14:53.659
I thank you. I'm well.
And yourself?

14:55.600 --> 14:57.067
Surviving.

15:04.800 --> 15:08.782
- You're enchanting.
- (She laughs) You're very kind.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.906
As I hope you will be -
when we're finally alone.

15:12.080 --> 15:15.106
I shall wait upon you.
When will your husband be out?

15:16.080 --> 15:17.820
When
I
am.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.424
Adderley...you must return to Miss Page.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.465
She's missing your attentions.

15:23.640 --> 15:27.701
Do you know, Poldark, there's only
one person I ever take instructions from?

15:27.880 --> 15:29.222
That is myself.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.864
Ross...Captain Adderley
has kindly suggested he wait on us.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.907
Which...would be delightful,
would it not?

15:40.840 --> 15:45.425
But perhaps we should meet elsewhere.
For... For tea...or for cards.

15:45.600 --> 15:49.343
- An excellent thought.
- Ross, Mrs Gower's asking for you.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.504
I shall send a note, Captain Adderley,
confirming arrangements.

15:54.680 --> 15:56.068
Shall we say Thursday?

16:01.360 --> 16:03.339
(Music and chatter)

16:10.280 --> 16:12.145
Did she bite?

16:12.320 --> 16:15.027
- Nibbled.
- I doubt that. She's a virtuous woman.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.784
And within a week
she will not be a virtuous woman.

16:22.120 --> 16:24.099
Care to wager on it?

16:26.720 --> 16:28.585
Hundred guineas to ten?

16:28.760 --> 16:33.220
Longer odds I'm not to prepared to offer,
for if you win, you'll have all the fun.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.302
No.

16:36.640 --> 16:41.145
I perceive that if I win...
it's you who'll be the more satisfied.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.499
(They chuckle)

16:56.960 --> 16:59.520
Captain Adderley is a strange creature.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.897
I think I'm a little afeared of him.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.389
Then why agree to see more of him?

17:05.560 --> 17:07.539
Did I do wrong?

17:07.720 --> 17:10.029
I'd no wish to be discourteous.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.703
Caroline said not to take him seriously.

17:14.440 --> 17:17.898
Well, after Thursday,
let's hope we've seen the last of him.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.499
(He grunts)

17:26.600 --> 17:27.624
Ah.

17:27.800 --> 17:31.258
- Here's Papa on his throne!
- Is he a king?

17:31.440 --> 17:34.625
Of the most tiresome constituency in Britain.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.905
Come and look at my horse!

17:38.080 --> 17:40.423
Wilbraham refuses to resign his seat.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.229
So you cannot replace him with Adderley,
nor direct him to vote as you wish?

17:44.400 --> 17:46.186
Precisely. And here...

17:46.360 --> 17:47.748
40 of the poorest rate-payers

17:47.920 --> 17:51.219
presume to demand favours
in exchange for their vote!

17:51.400 --> 17:55.507
I've no intention of pandering to them.
I'm tempted to demolish their hovels altogether!

17:55.680 --> 17:57.864
That would not be popular.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.827
Unless you housed them elsewhere...

18:01.720 --> 18:04.223
Outside the borough?

18:04.400 --> 18:06.618
And no longer able to hold me to ransom.

18:06.800 --> 18:10.179
Some derelict cottages,
bought for a pittance, cheaply repaired?

18:10.360 --> 18:12.260
Then no-one could accuse me of inhumanity.

18:12.440 --> 18:15.625
In fact, you could argue
you're actually improving their lot.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.859
Mama should've been a politician.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.019
(Chatter and laughter)

18:31.240 --> 18:33.379
(Chatter drowns his speech)

18:44.360 --> 18:47.944
What are the chances?
That's my lucky number.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.224
- Captain Adderley...
- Monk.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.665
That name seems not apt
for a man of your disposition.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.944
You have an agile tongue...

19:01.160 --> 19:04.140
...which I shall know
what to do with in due course.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.059
Next week, there's bound to be
a late sitting in the House.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.902
- Will you be present?
- God forbid!

19:11.080 --> 19:14.902
But your husband will.
Which is most convenient.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.502
For us.

19:21.520 --> 19:25.468
Does Adderley suppose I shall stand by
and watch him cuckold me?

19:27.040 --> 19:29.383
You think he has the slightest chance?

19:40.120 --> 19:41.223
Ross?

19:42.360 --> 19:44.578
No, I imagine not.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.108
But you do imagine.

19:49.280 --> 19:53.501
Because of Hugh,
you have all manner of suspicion.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.947
As if I would even look twice
at such a man as Adderley!

19:59.120 --> 20:01.782
- Then make it clear that you would not.
- How?

20:01.960 --> 20:06.420
By not allowing him to paw every bone
in your arm from wrist to shoulder?

20:06.600 --> 20:08.181
Ross, what am I to do?

20:08.360 --> 20:11.705
I'm in London for the_first time -
unacqualnted With Its ways.

20:11.880 --> 20:16.419
A man pays me compliments -
an educated, well-bred, member of parliament.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.621
Do I turn my back and refuse to answer?

20:20.800 --> 20:23.507
Or do I smack his face and spit on his shoe?

20:33.480 --> 20:35.459
Forgive me.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.299
That was unfair of me.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.107
Yes, it was!

20:49.480 --> 20:51.584
It won't happen again.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.259
(Approaching footsteps)

21:00.760 --> 21:03.706
First a pocket borough...
now a pocket MP!

21:03.880 --> 21:06.098
- Roger Wilbraham resigned?
- He did not.

21:06.280 --> 21:09.181
But in exchange for certain...inducements,

21:09.360 --> 21:11.499
he has agreed to vote as I direct.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.103
And at a cheaper rate
than I would have paid Adderley.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.861
Papa is very clever!

21:16.040 --> 21:17.382
(George chuckles)

21:17.560 --> 21:19.460
He most certainly is!

21:19.640 --> 21:20.982
(Whispers)

21:26.440 --> 21:28.101
(Ross sighs softly)

21:29.080 --> 21:30.581
(She grunts softly)

21:36.400 --> 21:38.539
Oh, Ross, how lovely!

21:39.200 --> 21:42.545
Lark's Heel, Mignonette...
Love-Lies-Bleeding. ..

21:42.720 --> 21:44.699
Some I've never seen before.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.144
Perhaps you should read the note.

21:50.520 --> 21:54.104
- Captain Adderley?
- Shall I throw them in the gutter?

21:56.200 --> 21:57.827
Oh, you think?

21:58.440 --> 21:59.907
But...could we not keep 'em?

22:05.840 --> 22:07.228
As you wish.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.384
I only thought 't'would be a sin to waste 'em.

22:30.560 --> 22:33.779
But...now I wonder,
did it give Ross the wrong notion?

22:33.960 --> 22:37.259
Ross is no fool. He could hardly
feel threatened by an idiot like Adderley.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.385
- You think? _
- There's no comparison.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.907
For instance, at this very moment,
where is Ross?

22:43.080 --> 22:44.945
- In the House.
- Exactly.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.020
Doing his duty at an important vote.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.306
Whereas Adderley will be
making a nuisance of himself

22:50.480 --> 22:53.586
in some disreputable
establishment or other.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.739
(Horse and carriage passing)

22:56.680 --> 22:58.659
(Fire roaring)

23:02.960 --> 23:04.427
Welcome, my dear.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.619
You've kept me waiting, but no matter.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.825
The pleasure will be all the greater.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.464
- How did you...
- Mrs Parkins.

23:14.160 --> 23:17.027
I said I was your brother.

23:17.200 --> 23:22.183
I'm sorry, Captain Adderley,
but...l must ask you to leave.

23:23.280 --> 23:25.623
I see my flowers have pride of place.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.225
Captain Adderley, I'm a married woman.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.618
Oh, yes, I'm quite aware.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.381
And I've stationed a man outside,

23:35.560 --> 23:40.680
who'll delay your husband
long enough to let me slip away.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.825
So...shall we come to the matter?

23:47.040 --> 23:48.940
Or would you prefer to converse awhile?

23:49.120 --> 23:51.224
Shall we talk of...

23:52.360 --> 23:54.225
...the men I've killed?

23:54.400 --> 23:57.460
- Or the women I've loved?
- Must we speak of love at all?

23:57.640 --> 23:59.062
Oh, I think so.

23:59.800 --> 24:03.782
For I intend to instruct you
most delicately in it.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.857
You see? How swiftly I arouse you?

24:09.040 --> 24:11.019
- You flatter yourself.
- Do I?

24:12.680 --> 24:17.185
Let me assure you...
this is no trivial fancy.

24:19.120 --> 24:22.100
I find you utterly bewitching.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.581
Tell me...

24:25.240 --> 24:26.980
Do you cry out when a man takes you?

24:27.160 --> 24:28.548
I must ask you to leave!

24:28.720 --> 24:30.665
Have you ever had another man
besides your husband?

24:30.840 --> 24:33.149
- Sir, are you a gentleman?
- I hope so.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.220
Then, forgive me,
I am unsure of London manners,

24:35.400 --> 24:37.982
but is it not a gentleman's duty
to withdraw when a lady asks him?

24:38.160 --> 24:41.061
Only when the gentleman
has already been in.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.379
(Bell tinkles)

24:46.560 --> 24:48.869
Mrs Parkins will show you out.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.786
- May I wait on you some other time?
- I think not.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.939
(He chuckles)

25:02.720 --> 25:04.187
I see.

25:04.960 --> 25:07.383
It's not me you're afraid of,
but your husband.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.065
- Does he beat you?
- Frequently.

25:10.600 --> 25:14.024
When his arm gets tired,
tell him to send for me.

25:15.440 --> 25:17.749
Good night...ma'am.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.257
- You think I encouraged him.
- Do you think you did?

25:25.440 --> 25:26.941
I don't know, Ross.
Since the ball,

25:27.120 --> 25:30.180
I can't rightly say if anything I do
is right or wrong.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.225
What must I do, Ross?

25:32.920 --> 25:34.899
How must I behave?

25:36.040 --> 25:38.019
You know very well how to behave.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.699
(She sighs)

25:42.000 --> 25:43.979
(Birdsong)

26:03.000 --> 26:04.979
(Shallow breaths)

26:14.280 --> 26:16.020
(Lively chatter)

26:18.920 --> 26:20.342
(Chuckling)

26:27.160 --> 26:29.378
Sir... You risk losing your seat.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.869
- Would you guard it for me?
- Certainly.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.501
This seat is bespoke.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.659
Well, now it is.

26:46.080 --> 26:49.709
You're a relative novice, Poldark,
so let me advise you.

26:50.360 --> 26:53.500
There's no such thing in the House
as "my" seat.

26:56.200 --> 27:01.661
Is there such a thing as "my" gloves?
Because you appear to be sitting on them.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.307
My dear, you're mistook.

27:04.920 --> 27:09.425
Why would I wish to touch
any of your worn possessions?

27:29.840 --> 27:31.546
I do beg your pardon.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.899
My gloves were indeed beneath you.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.424
Or was it the other way round?

27:44.960 --> 27:47.178
(Muttering)

27:55.320 --> 27:58.824
Sir, the insult you paid me in the House...

27:59.000 --> 28:01.707
was of a nature which brooks no apology.

28:04.520 --> 28:09.264
I therefore desire you to meet me
at dawn in Hyde Park on Thursday...

28:09.440 --> 28:11.499
with a brace of pistols.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.624
My second will be John Craven...

28:17.520 --> 28:19.181
...and I desire this matter be kept...

28:19.360 --> 28:22.739
"..secret for reasons which will be plain to you".
Well, it's absurd!

28:23.760 --> 28:25.625
Over a brief skirmish in the House?

28:25.800 --> 28:27.427
Obviously, you'll ignore it.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.420
I've already accepted.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.583
Ross, are you mad?
The man's a renowned duellist.

28:32.760 --> 28:34.227
- He's killed five men!
- So have I.

28:34.400 --> 28:37.585
- In a duel? With pistols?
- I will practise tomorrow.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.059
Of course you know why I'm here?

28:42.760 --> 28:44.387
To ask me to be your second?
I accept.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.027
- Thank you.
- Then I have the right

28:46.200 --> 28:50.079
to use my best endeavours to have
this whole sorry nonsense called off.

28:52.120 --> 28:55.260
On what grounds
would you agree to withdraw?

28:55.440 --> 28:57.260
Ross, for God's sake!

28:57.440 --> 29:00.022
- Does Demelza know?
- No. Nor must Caroline.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.337
Tomorrow I plan a day of distractions.

29:03.520 --> 29:06.341
Demelza will be so tired
she'll sleep late the morning after.

29:06.520 --> 29:08.545
Ross, I beg you, reconsider.

29:09.240 --> 29:10.787
These affairs can never be hushed up.

29:10.960 --> 29:14.942
And if your involvement is even suspected,
you would lose everything.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.982
(Pistol clicks and fires)

29:32.240 --> 29:34.299
The entire situation is absurd.

29:35.880 --> 29:38.986
Do you think you could
persuade Adderley to withdraw?

29:39.160 --> 29:41.105
Do you think you could persuade Poldark?

29:43.680 --> 29:45.989
(Pistol clicks and fires)

30:01.320 --> 30:03.185
(Muffled dramatic performance)

30:03.360 --> 30:05.339
(Audience laughs)

30:08.040 --> 30:09.940
(Gunshot)

30:25.920 --> 30:27.899
(Muffled performance)

30:47.680 --> 30:49.341
(She yawns)

30:49.520 --> 30:53.217
Ross, we must take Demelza home.
We've completely exhausted her.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.618
Yes. Quite right.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.626
L...spoke with Craven.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.420
Adderley will not withdraw.
If anything, he's more stubborn than you.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.067
I could have told you that.

31:04.240 --> 31:06.504
Ross... Go to him.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.379
Tell him you've no interest in false heroics.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.221
You're a veteran of the American War.

31:11.400 --> 31:14.745
If he calls you a coward,
people would only laugh at him.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.219
(Clock ticking)

31:23.680 --> 31:25.659
(Birdsong)

31:28.760 --> 31:31.263
(Squawking)

31:59.440 --> 32:01.419
(Birdsong)

32:02.200 --> 32:04.384
(Footsteps crunching on leaves)

32:59.720 --> 33:02.029
ROSS: Sleep well?

33:02.200 --> 33:03.622
Like a baby!

33:03.800 --> 33:07.861
Knowing that my dearest friend
is about to indulge in an act of utter madness!

33:08.040 --> 33:10.099
Let's not overdramatise, Dwight.

33:10.760 --> 33:15.902
But...if his aim is better than mine -
which is likely -

33:17.480 --> 33:20.460
may I ask that you and Caroline
take care of Demelza and the children?

33:20.640 --> 33:22.699
There is still time _
to come to an accommodation.

33:22.880 --> 33:27.499
As God is my judge,
I thought you'd scuttled back to Cornwall!

33:27.680 --> 33:31.104
Captain Adderley.
No-one knows of this encounter but ourselves.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.657
You have nothing to lose
and everything to gain

33:33.840 --> 33:37.867
by looking on it as a superficial quarrel
not worthy of bloodshed.

33:38.040 --> 33:41.624
Shake hands and both go home
to a hearty breakfast.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.067
Very well.

33:50.800 --> 33:53.257
If Captain Poldark will apologise now...

33:54.080 --> 33:58.301
...and undertake to send me a written apology
couched in suitable terms...

34:00.280 --> 34:02.225
...I might consider it.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.459
Though I should think very ill of him if he did.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.181
Well?

34:08.640 --> 34:10.380
Ross?

34:13.480 --> 34:16.460
My only regret
is that I apologised in the first place.

34:18.560 --> 34:19.982
We're wasting time.

34:20.160 --> 34:24.460
It must all be over before the city wakes.
Have you your pistols, gentlemen?

34:39.680 --> 34:41.989
Forgive me, my love.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.826
Ross?

35:00.240 --> 35:02.140
It's time.

35:02.320 --> 35:05.539
A moment.
No-one knows of this due! but we four?

35:06.360 --> 35:08.999
- Yes.
- So if I should wound or kill you,

35:09.160 --> 35:13.620
I shall waste no time inquiring after your health
but shall ride away as fast as I can.

35:13.800 --> 35:17.429
If...by mischance, you should injure me...

35:18.240 --> 35:20.140
...I suggest you do likewise.

35:20.320 --> 35:23.300
And the injured party's
been "set upon by footpads".

35:23.480 --> 35:25.505
- Agreed.
- I should hate to languish in jail

35:25.680 --> 35:27.386
for shedding your blood, my dear.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.624
Gentlemen, if you please.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.182
Fourteen paces.

35:36.360 --> 35:37.907
I shall count.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.547
One...

35:43.720 --> 35:44.982
two...

35:45.160 --> 35:46.582
three...

35:46.760 --> 35:48.227
four...

35:48.400 --> 35:50.140
five...

35:50.320 --> 35:51.344
six...

35:51.520 --> 35:52.544
SEVEN...

35:52.720 --> 35:54.108
eight...

35:54.280 --> 35:55.463
nine...

35:55.640 --> 35:56.664
ten...

35:56.840 --> 35:59.024
11...12...

35:59.200 --> 36:00.337
13...

36:00.520 --> 36:02.181
14.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.779
Attend.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.297
Present.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.422
Fire!

36:21.840 --> 36:23.785
(Fizzing)

36:23.960 --> 36:25.939
(Soft high-pitched tone)

36:28.640 --> 36:29.823
Enough!

36:30.000 --> 36:32.025
Honour is satisfied!

36:32.200 --> 36:34.760
Lay down your pistols and go home now.

36:42.320 --> 36:43.708
Argh!

36:45.080 --> 36:46.741
Ross!

36:47.440 --> 36:49.897
- Adderley. Is he...
- Dr Enys! Help me!

36:50.080 --> 36:51.866
Go! Go to him! Go.

36:52.040 --> 36:55.100
Get something round your arm
or you'll bleed to death!

36:59.120 --> 37:00.462
(Adderley groans)

37:11.560 --> 37:13.425
Blasted pistols!

37:14.160 --> 37:15.900
Damn near missed you altogether!

37:16.080 --> 37:17.980
- Where's Craven gone?
- To get a carriage.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.663
- Get off. As agreed.
- I'll stay till the carriage comes.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.262
You idiot!

37:22.440 --> 37:24.419
No time for heroics.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.866
Wish I'd shot your head off.

37:28.040 --> 37:31.066
Can you ride home?
Then go! Craven might bring the Watch.

37:31.240 --> 37:34.220
- I'll stay till the carriage arrives.
- Damn you, Poldark.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.300
Damn and blast you to all eternity.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.341
Adderley?

37:45.800 --> 37:47.381
Hold this.

37:48.080 --> 37:49.104
- I'll come with you.
- And I.

37:49.280 --> 37:52.226
No. Fair's fair.
Conditions have been observed.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.777
- Go home and send for a physician.
- Can you manage?

37:54.960 --> 37:57.827
I'll come to you presently. Help me.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.059
(Adderley groans)

38:00.880 --> 38:02.507
Ross, get away from this place.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.944
The Watch will be here any minute!

38:06.760 --> 38:08.148
Under the arms. Quickly.

38:09.280 --> 38:10.781
(Door opens)

38:10.960 --> 38:12.939
(Footsteps approaching)

38:15.680 --> 38:17.022
Judas! Ross!

38:17.200 --> 38:18.542
Drink this.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.984
- Dwight!
- Adderley. How is he?

38:21.160 --> 38:23.264
I extracted the ball.
It was lodged in the groin.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.226
Will he live? (Groans)

38:25.840 --> 38:28.058
Demelza, fetch me some water.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.741
(Stifled moaning)

38:33.760 --> 38:35.466
The ball's hit a splinter off the radius.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.983
I'll take that piece of bone out.
Have you brandy?

38:38.160 --> 38:40.742
- Forget the brandy. Do what you must.
- As you wish.

38:40.920 --> 38:43.024
Stay...very still.

38:46.520 --> 38:49.580
(Ross stifles cries of agony)

38:52.280 --> 38:54.180
(Ross panting)

38:54.360 --> 38:56.339
- Argh.
- Stay still.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.427
It's done.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.298
Demelza, you look as if you would faint.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.422
Pour yourself a brandy.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.501
To the Prime Minister.

39:30.680 --> 39:32.022
Requesting an audience.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.259
But how could you ever hope
for such a thing?

39:34.440 --> 39:36.385
Because, my dear, he's in need of votes.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.903
And I now have two to place at his disposal.

39:40.120 --> 39:43.419
Though, I suppose I must now
break the bad news to Adderley.

39:43.600 --> 39:47.184
That he must keep to
his less lucrative seat in Shropshire?

39:47.360 --> 39:50.420
He has a strong constitution.
I daresay he'll cope.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.706
(Fire crackling)

39:54.480 --> 39:56.823
DEMELZA: Why did Ross do this?

40:03.320 --> 40:05.504
You know men and their codes of honour.

40:05.680 --> 40:08.183
Ross would have lost respect
had he not fought.

40:08.360 --> 40:10.225
What else might he have lost?

40:10.400 --> 40:12.106
His family?

40:12.280 --> 40:13.747
His career? His life?

40:15.360 --> 40:16.827
Is this my fault?

40:18.000 --> 40:19.467
Did they not quarrel over me?

40:21.560 --> 40:24.142
Ross and I were happy.
I was... I was excited.

40:24.320 --> 40:26.880
Everything was new but...

40:27.040 --> 40:29.224
maybe I was freer than I should've been.

40:29.400 --> 40:32.699
Maybe I'm too free everywhere -
my manners too open.

40:32.880 --> 40:34.381
Judas, why did I come?

40:34.560 --> 40:38.542
My dear, you might visit London 20 times
without this happening.

40:39.320 --> 40:41.504
Take heart it's no worse.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.907
(Knock at door)

40:47.080 --> 40:49.264
Stay here. It may be the Watch.

41:00.440 --> 41:02.146
- Adderley is dead.
- Dear God.

41:02.320 --> 41:03.344
Judas!

41:07.960 --> 41:13.262
He's given out that he was practising in the park
with pistols and accidentally shot himself.

41:16.440 --> 41:20.865
He asked Craven to write that you were
a damned fool to stay in the park

41:21.040 --> 41:23.702
until the carriage came -
for now there is a witness.

41:23.880 --> 41:26.587
Adderley paid him ten guineas
to stop his mouth.

41:26.760 --> 41:29.627
Therefore you now owe Adderley that sum.

41:29.800 --> 41:32.439
He wishes for the debt
to be paid to George Warleggan.

41:32.600 --> 41:34.067
In settlement of a wager.

41:35.080 --> 41:36.468
Concerning myself?

41:38.000 --> 41:39.706
He does not say.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.579
(Low chatter)

41:50.400 --> 41:51.822
Why the sombre looks?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.740
Did somebody die?

41:54.520 --> 41:56.181
Death by m/Sadventure?

41:56.880 --> 41:58.347
- So an accident.
- Of course not!

41:58.520 --> 41:59.862
The inquest verdict must

42:00.040 --> 42:02.258
- and will be overturned.
- On what grounds?

42:02.440 --> 42:06.501
On the grounds that he was murdered...
in a duel...by Ross.

42:06.680 --> 42:08.739
- Do we know this?
- What we know

42:08.920 --> 42:12.139
is that Ross is wounded
and confined to his chamber.

42:12.320 --> 42:15.107
What further proof is required?
Why has he not been arrested?

42:15.280 --> 42:17.919
And yet - forgive me, dear-

42:18.080 --> 42:20.867
I've as much wish as you
to see justice done, but...

42:21.600 --> 42:24.182
...has anyone actually
accused Ross of anything?

42:24.360 --> 42:25.702
- Did Adderley?
- No...

42:25.880 --> 42:27.905
He claimed his wounds were self-inflicted.

42:28.080 --> 42:31.299
And that his great friend Craven
"just happened to be passing".

42:31.480 --> 42:35.143
And that Enys was miraculously strolling
in the park at the same ungodly hour!

42:35.320 --> 42:37.299
- What more_ can be said?
- The carriage driver!

42:37.480 --> 42:41.257
- What attempts have been made to trace him?
- My dear... (She sighs)

42:41.440 --> 42:43.579
Why do you care?

42:43.760 --> 42:45.819
There's nothing to be done.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.027
As I understand it, once a verdict
has been reached, it cannot be overturned.

42:52.120 --> 42:53.303
No.

42:58.520 --> 43:02.069
Unless there is fresh evidence.

43:04.800 --> 43:06.984
(Bell tinkles)

43:08.960 --> 43:14.978
You will find me two men who are willing to
undertake enquiries of a clandestine nature.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.424
There will be a significant reward.

43:34.440 --> 43:39.025
Dr Behenna believes you have
suffered greatly since your miscarriage.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.666
He's mistaken.

43:46.160 --> 43:48.378
I believe it was for the best.

43:49.280 --> 43:51.419
I could not have loved the child.

43:52.120 --> 43:54.759
I would have been prevented from loving it.

43:57.680 --> 44:01.343
It would have been taken from me
as John Conan has been.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.423
Dr Behenna believes you have lost your wits

44:04.600 --> 44:07.626
and has arranged for you to go to a place
where they can be recovered.

44:09.200 --> 44:11.304
How very kind of him, ma'am.

44:12.320 --> 44:14.060
(She sighs)

44:21.000 --> 44:22.979
(Gulls crying)

44:33.120 --> 44:35.099
(Murmur of conversation)

44:41.760 --> 44:44.137
- You know who that is?
- Sir John Mitford.

44:44.320 --> 44:46.106
- The Attorney General.
- My uncle and he

44:46.280 --> 44:48.339
were at the Inns of Court together.

44:49.040 --> 44:50.746
Introduce me.

44:51.800 --> 44:54.109
And what do you make of this sad demise

44:54.280 --> 44:57.386
of our promising young politician,
Captain Monk Adderley?

44:57.560 --> 44:59.061
A particular friend of ours.

44:59.240 --> 45:02.459
And to think of his being
so callously murdered...

45:02.640 --> 45:04.540
I believe the verdict was "misadventure".

45:04.720 --> 45:06.460
Yes, my dear, but no-one believes that.

45:06.640 --> 45:09.382
Oh, you mean this erm...
this story of a duel?

45:10.240 --> 45:12.982
- Yes, what's the other fellow's name?
- Poldark.

45:13.160 --> 45:16.379
- A despicable creature.
- Yes, but then so was Adderley.

45:17.080 --> 45:19.742
- Pity they didn't kill each other, eh?
- (Chuckling)

45:19.920 --> 45:21.626
Well, sir, they did not, and...

45:21.800 --> 45:24.382
and should Poldark now go free,
without even being charged?

45:24.560 --> 45:27.142
My dear, can you expect Sir John
to pursue every criminal?

45:27.320 --> 45:32.064
In any case, there's no suggestion
this Poldark fellow didn't shoot him in fair fight.

45:32.240 --> 45:33.821
But...duelling is illegal, sir.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.901
The law decrees it differs not one jot
from ordinary murder.

45:37.080 --> 45:40.220
Yes, as it happens, sir,
I am acquainted with the law.

45:40.400 --> 45:43.426
If a man is killed in a duel,
his opponent shall be indicted for murder.

45:43.600 --> 45:45.420
The law, however, demands evidence.

45:45.600 --> 45:51.061
Rumour and suspicion are notoriously
unreliable when they go into the witness box.

45:51.240 --> 45:56.177
When you have more to go on
than drawing-room gossip...do let me know.

46:04.840 --> 46:09.618
Well, my friend, it appears you will not,
after all, be challenging Tholly to a hook-fight!

46:09.800 --> 46:10.869
Oh, Dwight, thank God!

46:11.040 --> 46:16.023
But...if you'll take my advice,
as soon as you're fit to travel, return to Cornwall.

46:16.200 --> 46:18.760
The law could move against you
if witnesses come to light.

46:18.920 --> 46:21.423
But it will easier do so here
than 300 miles away.

46:21.600 --> 46:24.467
- Heed him, Ross.
- I appreciate your concern.

46:24.640 --> 46:26.346
- But?
- If I flee,

46:26.520 --> 46:29.705
it will seem to confirm my guilt,
so I will remain here.

46:30.400 --> 46:31.662
- (Door bangs)
- Hello?

46:33.040 --> 46:34.359
What's this I hear?

46:34.520 --> 46:37.421
Uncle Ross has been
shooting off his own hand?

46:38.440 --> 46:39.759
(Ross chuckles)

46:40.840 --> 46:43.866
It appears I'm not the only Poldark
who knows how to misbehave.

46:45.680 --> 46:47.625
Morwenna?

46:55.160 --> 46:57.185
Good riddance.

46:57.360 --> 46:59.499
(Clanging)

47:11.480 --> 47:12.583
Drake?

47:28.680 --> 47:30.659
I came because...

47:32.240 --> 47:34.800
...I want to explain...

47:34.960 --> 47:37.303
why I shunned you after Osborne died.

47:37.480 --> 47:39.459
It was too soon.

47:39.640 --> 47:41.585
I see that now.

47:41.760 --> 47:45.503
No matter how unhappy you were,
he was your husband.

47:45.680 --> 47:47.227
He was an animal...

47:49.760 --> 47:51.546
...who...

47:53.800 --> 47:56.223
...who abused me
in every possible way.

47:57.840 --> 48:01.503
I was nothing to him
but an object to satisfy his lust.

48:03.440 --> 48:06.819
So, when he died...
and you came to me...

48:08.280 --> 48:10.339
...all I could see was a man.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.264
And all that we had with each other...

48:16.720 --> 48:19.063
...all that was beautiful...

48:19.240 --> 48:21.504
and all that was true...

48:21.680 --> 48:23.864
was turned in my mind to baseness.

48:24.800 --> 48:26.779
So I cannot look on love...

48:28.120 --> 48:30.680
...on carnal love, without revulsion.

48:32.680 --> 48:35.706
If your hands touched me,
I would think of his hands.

48:36.600 --> 48:39.182
If you kissed me,
I would think of his mouth.

48:40.720 --> 48:42.267
And the thought of...

48:43.080 --> 48:44.980
...and the thought of flesh...

48:45.160 --> 48:47.344
any flesh, against my own...

48:51.880 --> 48:53.666
Forgive me.

48:53.840 --> 48:55.865
Forgive me. I can never...

48:56.720 --> 48:58.381
Morwenna!

49:08.120 --> 49:09.985
GEORGE: Anything?

49:10.160 --> 49:11.661
No.

49:17.440 --> 49:20.625
Every time...he wriggles off the hook!

49:22.200 --> 49:24.862
Is our happiness contingent on his demise?

49:26.320 --> 49:29.027
Or your rise contingent on his fall?

49:29.880 --> 49:31.666
This came for you.

49:34.920 --> 49:37.059
The Prime Minister's office.

49:43.200 --> 49:45.464
- He will meet me next week.
- (She gasps)

49:48.160 --> 49:52.221
And I will know what price
to name for my two votes.

49:54.400 --> 49:58.427
The right to address my wife
as Lady Warleggan.

49:58.600 --> 50:00.545
A knighthood?

50:00.720 --> 50:05.180
And, in a few years,
a baronetcy which my son will inherit.

50:05.360 --> 50:07.737
- (Door opens)
- Ah.

50:08.840 --> 50:12.105
- This is a pleasant family scene!
- How was the museum, my love?

50:12.280 --> 50:15.226
Most diverting, Mama.
The mummies especially.

50:15.400 --> 50:17.106
Perhaps next time, I can take Valentine.

50:17.280 --> 50:20.226
Valentine, leave Aurelia now.
It's time for your supper.

50:20.400 --> 50:23.301
- I think he's going to fight a duel!
- (They chuckle)

50:23.480 --> 50:26.699
GEOFFREY CHARLES:
Lord, why have I never noticed this before?

50:26.880 --> 50:28.222
What?

50:28.400 --> 50:31.062
Is he not the very spit and image
of Uncle Ross?

50:31.240 --> 50:33.299
(He laughs)

50:34.320 --> 50:37.346
(Continues laughing)
Faster, Valentine.

50:40.160 --> 50:41.297
Faster.

50:45.240 --> 50:47.060
(Gun clicks)

50:47.240 --> 50:49.663
(Rocking horse squeaking)

50:54.960 --> 50:57.861
Poor Horace wonders
why he must be abandoned.

50:58.560 --> 51:01.700
Poor Horace knows _
that I've already stayed longer than Intended

51:01.880 --> 51:04.189
and must return to my patients.

51:05.000 --> 51:10.540
Horace wonders why Dr Enys cannot find it
in his heart to love London as he does?

51:10.720 --> 51:13.939
Horace knows that he and I
are of different breeds.

51:14.120 --> 51:17.419
At times our habits coincide.
At others they do not.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.697
Is this not what we chose
when we pledged ourselves to each other?

51:24.480 --> 51:28.701
Perhaps Horace will return to Cornwall
sooner than he thought.

51:31.440 --> 51:32.987
Perhaps he will.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.419
(Crunching)

52:03.920 --> 52:05.626
(He clears his throat)

52:17.720 --> 52:19.699
(Chatter and laughter)

52:29.040 --> 52:30.940
I knew it was too soon to be out and about.

52:31.120 --> 52:34.100
Folk would've forgot
if you'd stayed out of sight, but now...

52:45.720 --> 52:47.108
Shall we take refreshments?

52:47.280 --> 52:48.781
- I must speak with George.
- No. Ross!

52:48.960 --> 52:51.064
- This may not be the time.
- I promised Adderley.

52:52.280 --> 52:54.020
George!

53:01.600 --> 53:07.140
As you may know, I had a meeting
with your friend...Captain Adderley.

53:07.320 --> 53:10.983
And...before he died,
he asked me to convey a message.

53:11.760 --> 53:14.627
- Concerning?
- The sum of ten guineas.

53:14.800 --> 53:17.462
I understand he made some wager with you -
which he lost.

53:17.640 --> 53:21.019
He requested that I pay you on his behalf.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.340
(Coins clink and people gasp)

53:33.520 --> 53:34.908
(Ross groans)

53:38.920 --> 53:41.502
- I cannot imagine...
- What's happened?

53:42.880 --> 53:44.780
Is there something I can do?

53:48.480 --> 53:49.947
No, Ross.

53:50.880 --> 53:52.984
There's nothing you can do.

53:54.640 --> 53:57.461
(Chatter and laughter)

54:04.000 --> 54:05.820
(Lively chatter on street)

54:06.000 --> 54:08.457
- Ross...
- No.

54:09.160 --> 54:10.548
- No, what?
- I have no idea

54:10.720 --> 54:12.824
why George was so vicious towards me.

54:14.360 --> 54:16.021
'Tis not what I wanted to ask.

54:16.640 --> 54:17.982
What, then?

54:21.840 --> 54:23.979
Whether you truly feel safe.

54:24.680 --> 54:26.784
From the law, I mean.

54:27.480 --> 54:28.981
I feel safe.

54:32.280 --> 54:34.783
- And your arm?
- Is mending.

54:45.600 --> 54:47.784
It will all seem better in the morning.

55:38.600 --> 55:40.579
(He groans softly)

55:45.440 --> 55:47.067
Demelza?

56:10.080 --> 56:12.537
DEMELZ4: My dearest R055,

56:12.720 --> 56:15.541
by the time you read this I W/7/ be gone.

56:17.200 --> 56:20.704
Dwight is returning to Cornwall
and I’m going with him.

56:21.400 --> 56:23.743
I’m out of my depth in London society

56:24.960 --> 56:29.260
My wish to be friendly and polite
was taken by some to mean something more.

56:31.440 --> 56:34.420
It was even taken by you
to mean something more.

56:36.320 --> 56:38.424
I’m going home. ..

56:38.600 --> 56:43.378
to your house and your farm
and your mine and your ch/io'ren.

56:45.280 --> 56:47.145
And when you return...

56:48.000 --> 56:50.423
”we 7/ see if there ’5 anything to be done.
