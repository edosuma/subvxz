00:25.234 --> 00:28.237
- This is mutiny!
- No, sir, it's survival.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.949
They'll come for us. They're sendin' help.

00:31.990 --> 00:35.661
When they get here, it'll be too late.
It may already be too late.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.955
Don't do this.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.624
That's an order!

00:41.834 --> 00:43.961
Lieutenant Harper!

00:44.378 --> 00:48.674
Shoot me if you want, Captain Barclay,
but I'm not winding up like the others.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.684
Cast off!

01:07.442 --> 01:09.570
Hit me.

01:16.451 --> 01:21.874
- It looks like she's just driftin' out there.
- Mm. We're heading straight for her.

01:24.168 --> 01:28.881
This is the Lisette. Canadian
fishing vessel CV 233. Please identify.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.429
This is the Lisette. Come in, please.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.725
Cut the engines and meet me up on deck.

01:54.198 --> 01:56.325
Hello out there!

01:57.618 --> 01:59.328
Hey!

02:00.913 --> 02:04.499
We're throwin' you a line!
Grab it-we'll pull you in.

02:31.193 --> 02:34.363
Is everybody all right? Are there any injured...

02:54.364 --> 02:57.364
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 19 - Dod Kalm

03:51.064 --> 03:52.649
Thanks for comin'.

03:52.733 --> 03:56.069
- What's so urgent?
- I didn't wanna waste any time.

03:56.153 --> 04:00.949
A navy destroyer escort, the USS Ardent,
has been missing in the Atlantic for 42 hours.

04:01.033 --> 04:04.453
- Missing?
- No radio contact, no distress signals.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.039
Search planes haven't picked up anything.

04:07.122 --> 04:12.669
- You're saying a ship and its crew vanished?
- That's what it looked like... until last night.

04:12.753 --> 04:17.173
- A trawler picked up 18 survivors.
- They must have reported what happened.

04:17.257 --> 04:21.512
Only one survivor is still alive.
He's in the ICU under heavy security.

04:22.053 --> 04:25.557
- What is wrong with him?
- That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.

04:26.558 --> 04:31.313
They won't let me in, but your medical
background gets you a clearance code.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.942
I want your opinion.
His name is Lieutenant Richard Harper.

04:35.025 --> 04:38.529
- But, Mulder...
- Meet me at my office when you're finished.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.697
Thank you.

04:53.085 --> 04:56.630
Excuse me.
Is this Lieutenant Richard Harper?

04:56.713 --> 04:59.383
That's what his wristband says.

05:00.884 --> 05:04.847
- He's been identified?
- All military personnel are fingerprinted.

05:04.930 --> 05:10.602
- Those records were crosschecked.
- Then I think there's been a mistake here.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.481
According to this report,
Lieutenant Harper is 28.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.278
Why hasn't a systemic workup been run?

05:19.361 --> 05:25.200
I wasn't aware that my decisions required
your approval. I'm in charge of this patient.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.369
Let me see your clearance.

05:27.452 --> 05:31.456
What's going on here? How can you
explain what happened to this man?

05:31.540 --> 05:34.126
This clearance code is invalid.

05:34.543 --> 05:37.129
Where'd you get this? Who are you?

05:38.672 --> 05:42.634
I am a medical doctor. I'd like to see
the autopsy reports on the victims.

05:42.718 --> 05:48.640
I haven't time for this. Give me my patient's
chart and leave, before I have you removed.

05:58.066 --> 06:02.362
- Something strange is going on.
- Did they let you see Lieutenant Harper?

06:02.446 --> 06:05.657
I saw somebody,
but whether it was the lieutenant...

06:05.741 --> 06:10.621
- What do you mean?
- He looked about 90. Off by half a century.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.874
- You don't seem surprised.
- I wanna show you something.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.710
This was the Ardent's course
when she disappeared.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.797
I've tracked points of departure
and destination for each <font color="#00FF00">X-File</font>.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.551
On December 121949
a Royal Navy battleship disappeared...

06:24.635 --> 06:28.347
...between Leeds and Cape Perry. The sea was
calm, the weather sunny.

06:28.430 --> 06:31.433
In 1963, at the height of
the Cuban Missile Crisis...

06:31.517 --> 06:37.231
...a Soviet fleet left from here for Havana.
All six vessels vanished without a trace.

06:37.314 --> 06:43.695
I counted nine unexplained disappearances.
Each passed through here: the 65th parallel.

06:43.779 --> 06:47.324
- Another Bermuda Triangle?
- More like a wrinkle in time...

06:47.407 --> 06:50.744
...if Lieutenant Harper is any indication.

06:50.827 --> 06:55.082
- Wrinkle in time? Wh...
- Heard about the Philadelphia Experiment?

06:55.707 --> 07:00.629
It was a programme during World War Two
to render battleships invisible to radar.

07:00.712 --> 07:05.551
But it was discontinued and most of the
scientists were relocated to Los Alamos.

07:05.634 --> 07:09.137
Except none of them
ever made it to Los Alamos.

07:09.221 --> 07:12.933
- Where were they sent?
- Roswell, New Mexico.

07:13.559 --> 07:17.396
Are you suggesting that
the experiment used alien technology?

07:17.479 --> 07:21.233
Nine months after the alleged crash
of a UFO in Roswell...

07:21.316 --> 07:26.196
...the USS Eldridge disappeared altogether
from the Philadelphia navy yard...

07:26.280 --> 07:29.867
...to reappear minutes later
miles away in Norfolk, Virginia.

07:30.492 --> 07:34.121
That's not possible, not without
defying laws of time and space.

07:34.204 --> 07:39.084
Those physicists may have been
trying to manipulate wormholes on Earth.

07:39.168 --> 07:42.546
- Wormholes?
- Portals where matter interfaces with time...

07:42.629 --> 07:45.174
...at a decelerated or accelerated rate.

07:45.257 --> 07:48.552
I bet the military never stopped
the work it began 50 years ago.

07:48.844 --> 07:52.431
- That's what you think happened to Harper?
- I'll know soon enough.

07:52.514 --> 07:56.643
- I'm booked on an 8.30 flight to Norway.
- Have you let Skinner in on this?

07:56.727 --> 08:02.482
I've given myself a 24-hour head start before
I give him my report. I want this one myself.

08:04.568 --> 08:06.737
I'm going with you.

08:07.529 --> 08:11.950
If that really was Lieutenant Harper,
I wanna know what happened to him.

08:16.788 --> 08:20.000
Nei, nei, det er altfor farlig.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.757
0 for 5.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.635
What is it, Mulder? Why are they so afraid?

08:30.469 --> 08:33.554
My father spent the better part
of his life at sea.

08:33.639 --> 08:37.267
He had a healthy respect for the ocean,
but he never feared it.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.686
I see fear in these men's eyes.

08:39.770 --> 08:43.482
Brundtland couldn't have
taken you up there anyway.

08:46.068 --> 08:53.033
A ship has to be classified ice class
before it can even go past the Lofoten Basin.

08:53.283 --> 08:56.119
My name is Trondheim. Henry Trondheim.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.330
The ship you want is the Zeal.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.959
It's a 50-ton trawler
with a double hull. It's my ship.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.170
- You're American.
- I was born and raised in Pensacola.

09:05.254 --> 09:08.757
I ran a charter business there.
I got fed up with tourists.

09:08.841 --> 09:11.969
How do you feel about the sea
north of Beerenberg?

09:12.052 --> 09:14.596
This time of year, it'd be ten hours each way.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.391
- So you've been there?
- A few times.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.768
Got some of my best hauls out of there.

09:19.852 --> 09:25.732
- Why is everyone else so afraid to go there?
- Well, legends. They grew up on stories.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.693
What stories?

09:27.776 --> 09:31.196
A huge stone came out of the sky,
crashed into the pack ice.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.699
- A meteorite?
- An evil god.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.870
They worship it by... stayin' away.

09:42.040 --> 09:46.086
So... exactly what is it that
you're lookin' for up there?

09:47.629 --> 09:50.048
A number of things.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.885
How good are you?

09:52.968 --> 09:57.681
About as good as you're going to get,
considering no one else will take you there.

09:57.764 --> 10:02.436
- When can we leave?
- As soon as we shake on a price.

10:27.252 --> 10:31.965
- Feeling any better?
- Oh... Lucky you inherited your father's legs.

10:32.049 --> 10:34.635
- What?
- His sea legs.

10:37.846 --> 10:41.225
It's been 12 hours.
You said it'd take ten. What's goin' on?

10:41.308 --> 10:44.353
I told you before. The visibility is lousy.

10:45.354 --> 10:47.439
I've never seen it this thick.

10:47.523 --> 10:52.486
- How much longer till we get there?
- Well, we're right where you wanna be.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.781
I even think we've got
what you're looking for.

10:55.864 --> 10:59.284
Except one minute it's in front of us,
and the next it's not.

10:59.368 --> 11:02.079
Like something's messing with my radar.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.749
And my navigation system.

11:07.042 --> 11:10.754
- I can't explain it.
- Kaptein! Pass pÃ¥!

11:11.922 --> 11:14.258
We're gonna hit!

11:21.723 --> 11:24.393
Halvorsen, check the hull for damage.

11:34.111 --> 11:37.990
I don't get it.
This is what you're lookin' for?

11:38.740 --> 11:42.286
It's the USS Ardent.
It's a destroyer escort.

11:43.245 --> 11:44.705
All right.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.082
What do you want with it, anyway?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.504
It's a ghost ship.

11:54.590 --> 11:59.887
I mean, look at all this corrosion. No one's
been aboard this vessel in 20, 30 years.

12:01.972 --> 12:04.057
Scully.

12:07.936 --> 12:10.647
Let's check the crew quarters first.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.507
Mulder.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.732
They almost look mummified.

12:53.815 --> 12:56.985
Hm. Like they've been dead
a very long time.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.113
Except for this strange residue.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.911
- What was that?
- An engine.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.247
It's... my ship!

13:11.333 --> 13:14.962
- No! That's my ship!
- Hey!

13:16.046 --> 13:18.549
- Somebody's taken my ship!
- Hey!

13:18.632 --> 13:21.426
Hey!

13:22.302 --> 13:25.097
- That's my ship!
- Trondheim!

13:42.114 --> 13:43.991
No.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.661
All right. Try it again.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.414
No.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.583
What is it?

13:52.666 --> 13:56.879
It's caked with the same residue
that's covering everything.

13:58.172 --> 14:01.091
So we can't even send a distress signal.

14:02.301 --> 14:08.307
The engine's so corroded you can't even tell
what it is. I've never seen anything like it.

14:08.390 --> 14:12.895
Halvorsen's trying to salvage some parts,
but basically we are dead in the water.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.647
The radio's dead, too.

14:18.025 --> 14:21.653
Somebody's not tellin' me
what's goin' on here.

14:22.112 --> 14:26.366
Now, look, that ship was not just
my livelihood, that was my life!

14:26.450 --> 14:29.161
I have a right to some straight answers!

14:30.204 --> 14:34.458
What we're seeing here may be
the result of a military experiment.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.001
Military experiment?

14:36.084 --> 14:39.963
A time bend, where matter moves
through time at an accelerated rate.

14:40.047 --> 14:43.175
- Tell me in English.
- Time may be speeding up.

14:43.509 --> 14:48.764
Right. That's almost as crazy as Halvorsen's
"There's a rock that comes from the sky..."

14:48.847 --> 14:51.225
This ship was launched in 1991.

14:51.308 --> 14:56.730
I don't know how else to explain the extent
of the corrosion or the decay of the bodies.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.691
You're not buyin' any of this, are ya?

14:59.775 --> 15:02.069
Agh!

15:33.517 --> 15:35.602
Oh, God.

15:37.813 --> 15:40.524
- What happened?
- His skull's been fractured.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.068
Who's that?

15:44.111 --> 15:46.613
Halvorsen!

16:22.983 --> 16:25.319
Who are you?

16:27.487 --> 16:29.698
Captain Barclay...

16:29.781 --> 16:33.452
...commanding officer, USS Ardent.

16:40.959 --> 16:43.045
There you go.

16:46.423 --> 16:51.345
Captain Barclay... according to your log,
after the navigation system failed...

16:51.428 --> 16:55.140
...several of your crew members
saw something in the sea.

16:55.224 --> 16:57.309
A growing light.

16:58.852 --> 17:03.524
It-it came up through the fog
in the middle of the night.

17:04.566 --> 17:06.693
Like it was on fire.

17:07.694 --> 17:11.406
- Any idea what it might have been?
- Power loss.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.201
Everythin' stopped.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.203
Everythin'.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.829
Even the sea.

17:18.914 --> 17:21.124
Even the wind.

17:21.208 --> 17:24.211
Then the ship, my ship, she began to bleed.

17:24.294 --> 17:27.381
From the hull, through the rivet seams.

17:28.632 --> 17:31.093
He's a drunkard.

17:31.176 --> 17:33.470
He's a drunkard!

17:34.221 --> 17:36.431
And he killed Halvorsen.

17:36.515 --> 17:40.018
To hell with him!
I don't have to listen to his lies.

17:40.102 --> 17:43.188
I'm no liar. It happened.

17:43.522 --> 17:46.191
First to some of my men, then to all of 'em.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.486
What happened?

17:51.780 --> 17:54.157
Time got lost.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.166
It's OK, Captain. You can take it easy.

18:03.292 --> 18:06.587
We're gonna do
whatever we can to help you out.

18:07.963 --> 18:10.048
What can you do?

18:10.174 --> 18:12.301
You can't do anythin'.

18:12.426 --> 18:14.970
I'm 35 years old.

18:23.353 --> 18:26.481
- There's no way he killed Halvorsen.
- I agree.

18:26.565 --> 18:29.818
The blow was delivered
with considerable strength...

18:29.902 --> 18:32.779
...and he can't even
hold a glass with two hands.

18:32.863 --> 18:35.991
That means there's somebody else on board.

18:46.919 --> 18:49.379
You were a good first mate.

18:49.463 --> 18:52.591
You left me alone and you did your job.

18:55.636 --> 18:59.389
It's a shame this had to
happen to you so young.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.102
Gud vÃ¦re med deg.

19:16.448 --> 19:19.785
Put it down! Put down the pipe!

19:19.868 --> 19:21.787
Put it down!

19:33.131 --> 19:35.259
- I could kill you...
- Back off!

19:35.342 --> 19:39.263
- He killed Halvorsen!
- He may help us figure out what happened.

19:39.346 --> 19:42.391
Look at him! He hasn't aged. Back off!

19:47.104 --> 19:49.231
His name's Olafsson.

19:49.314 --> 19:52.442
- You know him?
- Everybody in Tildeskan knows him.

19:52.526 --> 19:55.654
He's a pirate whaler. He's a wanted criminal.

19:56.488 --> 20:00.951
He supplies whales to the Japanese
black market. Blues, belugas, sperm.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.911
Ask him how he got here.

20:02.995 --> 20:06.039
Hvordan kom du hit?

20:06.623 --> 20:08.292
GÃ¥ til helvete.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.460
I don't need a translator for that.

20:10.544 --> 20:14.590
We'll question him later.
I don't wanna leave Scully alone.

20:19.011 --> 20:22.139
- Get in the hull!
- I think we found who killed Halvorsen.

20:22.222 --> 20:25.309
He'd have killed me too
if it wasn't for Mulder.

20:25.392 --> 20:29.354
The log says four Norwegians
were picked up when their vessel sank.

20:29.646 --> 20:33.317
I guarantee Olafsson's men
took my boat and left him stranded.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.069
It's just like them to slit each other's throats.

20:36.153 --> 20:39.031
We should ask the captain
some more questions.

20:39.114 --> 20:41.742
Captain Barclay's dead.

20:41.825 --> 20:45.871
I don't know how it happened.
It was just in the last 15 minutes.

20:46.788 --> 20:49.374
It's just like those men below.

20:49.458 --> 20:54.213
It's more than rapid ageing, Mulder.
It's as if he's turning into a pillar of salt.

20:55.255 --> 21:00.677
- Is that what the substance is?
- It seems to be crystalline, but beyond that...

21:01.720 --> 21:03.639
We're all tired.

21:03.722 --> 21:08.519
Let's stow the captain's body.
Tie up Olafsson so we can all get some rest.

21:09.353 --> 21:12.481
I'll take first watch, in case he's not alone.

21:47.516 --> 21:49.601
- Scully?
- Hm?

21:50.602 --> 21:52.980
I just fell asleep.

21:53.063 --> 21:57.234
- You want a few more minutes?
- No, I'm up.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.450
Scully!

22:05.534 --> 22:08.036
Mulder, what happened to you?

22:18.755 --> 22:22.092
Time acceleration
is an equation, Mulder. A theory.

22:22.176 --> 22:25.304
Then theoretically it's possible.
What else could it be?

22:25.387 --> 22:27.890
Whatever it is, it isn't a time warp.

22:27.973 --> 22:31.727
None of us has observed
the phenomena recorded in the ship's log.

22:31.810 --> 22:37.691
- No evidence indicates this is a time warp.
- We're evidence! We're ageing by the minute!

22:37.774 --> 22:41.778
If this is rapid-ageing phenomena,
why hasn't our hair greyed?

22:41.862 --> 22:44.364
Then what about him? Huh?

22:44.990 --> 22:48.785
What about him? Why isn't he getting old?

22:49.161 --> 22:52.164
Hvorfor blir du ikke gammel?

22:52.247 --> 22:56.502
- Relax, Trondheim. Save your energy...
- I don't have to listen to you!

22:56.585 --> 23:01.089
- It's because of you that we got into this.
- Nobody twisted your arm.

23:01.173 --> 23:04.051
I signed on to bring you here.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.220
Not to die.

23:08.305 --> 23:12.142
- What do you know about free radicals?
- Is this a quiz?

23:12.726 --> 23:16.647
They're highly reactive chemicals
containing extra electrons.

23:16.730 --> 23:21.610
They can attack DNA. They can cause our
body tissue and cell membranes to oxidise.

23:21.902 --> 23:26.031
- Grow old, you mean.
- It's the prevailing theory on how we age.

23:26.782 --> 23:31.620
- Something is triggering that reaction in us?
- This is just a theory...

23:31.703 --> 23:36.416
...but what if this ship is drifting towards
another metallic source, like a meteor?

23:36.792 --> 23:40.170
Maybe it's deep in the ocean
or embedded into an iceberg.

23:40.254 --> 23:44.466
But the two could be acting
as positive and negative terminals...

23:44.550 --> 23:47.761
...with the ocean itself
being a kind of giant battery.

23:47.845 --> 23:52.099
That electromagnetic energy
could be exciting the free radicals...

23:52.182 --> 23:56.937
...and effectively oxidising
every piece of matter in its field.

23:57.020 --> 24:02.109
Makes sense, Scully. The organic equivalent
to rust would be rapid premature senescence.

24:02.192 --> 24:04.069
What the hell...?

24:16.456 --> 24:19.793
Captain Barclay said the ship was bleeding.

24:24.506 --> 24:27.009
It's not blood, Scully.

24:27.092 --> 24:29.178
It's rust.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.390
Trondheim, you keep an eye on Olafsson.

24:34.016 --> 24:37.269
- Where are you going?
- Mulder... where are we going?

24:38.478 --> 24:41.690
I'm not sure yet, but we don't
have much time to get there.

24:53.577 --> 24:58.624
D'you see this yellow pipe?
It's the only one that hasn't corroded through.

27:47.668 --> 27:50.379
Olafsson and his men.

27:50.712 --> 27:53.215
Why would they hole up here?

27:57.135 --> 28:00.097
This is the only drinkable water on the ship.

28:00.180 --> 28:03.642
We were both wrong, Scully. It's the water.

28:03.725 --> 28:07.062
- All the other water's been contaminated.
- How?

28:07.521 --> 28:12.150
Something must have got into the
desalination tanks, where the water is stored.

28:12.234 --> 28:16.363
But the water in the sewage system
is recycled. It doesn't come from the sea.

28:16.446 --> 28:20.951
If you're right, then Captain Barclay's
drinking binge is what kept him alive.

28:21.034 --> 28:24.580
And the water from this tank
will do the same for us.

28:25.247 --> 28:28.625
But it doesn't sound like
there's very much left.

28:57.321 --> 28:59.656
You were supposed to watch him.

28:59.865 --> 29:01.950
I feel pretty bad about it.

29:02.034 --> 29:04.411
I shouldn't have dozed off.

29:06.371 --> 29:08.624
What do you want me to say? He's gone.

29:08.707 --> 29:12.377
- I wanna know what happened!
- I can ask the same of you. You tied him up.

29:12.461 --> 29:15.339
There's nothing wrong with my knot!
This was severed.

29:15.422 --> 29:20.052
I don't like being interrogated.
I don't owe you any explanations.

29:20.719 --> 29:22.804
- Trondheim!
- Let go of me.

29:24.681 --> 29:27.351
Look, we have a lot of work to do here.

29:27.434 --> 29:30.479
I'll need blood and urine samples
from both of you.

29:31.438 --> 29:34.358
- What for?
- We found out what caused the ageing.

29:36.735 --> 29:39.571
What is it now?
The two of you are full of theories.

29:40.239 --> 29:44.451
First it's one thing, then another.
By the time you figure it out, we'll be dead.

29:44.535 --> 29:49.957
Something got into the desal tanks, but
the water in the sewage system is untainted.

29:50.040 --> 29:55.003
It kept Olafsson alive this long.
Maybe it'll slow the process in us.

29:55.087 --> 29:57.798
This is good news, isn't it?

29:58.882 --> 30:02.094
So what happens now?

30:04.680 --> 30:09.601
It has been 18 hours, 45 minutes
since the onset of symptoms.

30:09.685 --> 30:16.149
Rudimentary blood tests revealed impossibly
high concentrations of sodium chloride: salt.

30:16.859 --> 30:20.237
Though the contaminated water
itself is not saline...

30:20.320 --> 30:26.285
...it appears to catalyse existing body fluids,
causing massive and rapid cellular damage.

30:27.202 --> 30:32.457
The untainted water slowed the degenerative
progression in Trondheim and me.

30:32.541 --> 30:35.294
But Mulder has fared less well.

30:35.377 --> 30:39.464
Perhaps because of the dehydration
he suffered on the way here.

30:39.548 --> 30:42.551
I think I just lapped George Burns.

30:46.847 --> 30:49.224
I'll be right back.

31:15.209 --> 31:19.630
If you've got something to say, say it,
but don't hover behind me like that.

31:19.713 --> 31:24.092
- The water isn't helping him.
- Then maybe we should double his ration.

31:24.176 --> 31:29.264
- What for? A lake of water won't help him.
- We don't know that for sure.

31:31.850 --> 31:34.102
- Not yet.
- Look at him!

31:35.187 --> 31:39.024
- We've wasted too much water on him.
- Who are you to decide?

31:39.191 --> 31:43.737
You don't have to be a doctor
to see that... he isn't gonna make it.

31:51.537 --> 31:53.830
But you and me, Scully...

31:54.790 --> 31:59.711
...you and me, we'd better
start lookin' out for ourselves.

32:13.433 --> 32:17.521
Mulder's urinalysis continues
to indicate his kidneys'failure...

32:17.604 --> 32:21.608
...to excrete the substance
I'm calling "heavy salt".

32:21.692 --> 32:27.948
Whether the untainted water from the sewage
system is even helping him at all is unclear.

32:28.031 --> 32:32.619
What does remain clear to me...
is that I can't give up trying.

33:55.827 --> 33:57.996
Trondheim!

33:58.622 --> 34:01.959
- What are you doing?
- Listen to this.

34:04.670 --> 34:08.047
You know what that is? It's a funeral bell.

34:08.130 --> 34:11.552
There's only a few gallons left. Maybe less.

34:12.010 --> 34:15.472
There's enough to keep us
all alive for a few more days.

34:15.556 --> 34:19.226
Or one of us alive long enough to be rescued.

34:20.060 --> 34:22.688
Don't come any closer.

34:22.771 --> 34:25.357
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

34:26.859 --> 34:29.735
Trondheim... listen to me.

34:30.571 --> 34:36.034
The navy knows where we are. They know
these coordinates and they'll be here soon.

34:36.451 --> 34:40.746
- So why don't we go back to the mess hall...
- Why don't you just shoot me?

34:40.831 --> 34:44.458
If you think that I'm gonna
let Mulder have another drop!

34:48.005 --> 34:49.965
Trondheim!

34:50.424 --> 34:51.884
Trondheim!

36:23.892 --> 36:26.436
You're almost out of pages.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.106
It's good you kept a record.

36:32.276 --> 36:35.279
Trondheim's locked himself
in the sewage hold.

36:35.362 --> 36:39.449
He's back-flushed all the water
and he's keeping it for himself.

36:43.453 --> 36:45.956
I looked everywhere...

36:46.039 --> 36:48.709
...and this is all I could find.

36:48.792 --> 36:51.587
It's sardine juice, half a dozen lemons...

36:51.670 --> 36:55.424
...and, uh... the water from a snow globe.

36:57.676 --> 37:01.471
- It's not Evian, but...
- You go ahead and drink it.

37:02.681 --> 37:06.560
- No, Mulder.
- It's the only logical choice. You're a woman.

37:07.144 --> 37:11.899
Your life expectancy is greater and your
body retains more water and fatty tissues.

37:11.982 --> 37:13.942
More reason for you to drink it.

37:14.026 --> 37:18.322
You'll have a much greater chance
of surviving until help comes.

37:18.697 --> 37:23.827
- Don't do this, Mulder.
- Don't... don't be so stubborn, Scully.

37:23.911 --> 37:26.288
You know I'm right.

37:28.624 --> 37:32.753
Well, there isn't much liquid
to make a difference anyway.

37:32.836 --> 37:35.214
There might be.

37:41.220 --> 37:42.930
No.

38:00.364 --> 38:02.449
What was that?

38:05.369 --> 38:10.666
The outer hull must have finally corroded
through, which means we're taking on water.

38:14.837 --> 38:16.713
Mulder...

38:18.882 --> 38:20.968
...the water.

38:57.045 --> 38:59.339
I can't open the door!

39:03.594 --> 39:05.262
Help!

39:05.345 --> 39:07.764
Help me!

39:12.144 --> 39:14.646
Help me! Help! Help!

39:15.522 --> 39:18.150
Help me!

39:18.233 --> 39:21.153
Help me! Oh... Oh...

39:53.852 --> 39:59.149
I always thought when I got older
I'd maybe take a cruise somewhere.

39:59.233 --> 40:01.735
But this isn't exactly what I had in mind.

40:02.611 --> 40:06.156
The service on this ship is terrible, Scully.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.414
It's not fair.

40:17.084 --> 40:19.378
It's not our time.

40:21.296 --> 40:23.382
We still have work to do.

40:25.175 --> 40:27.052
Mulder...

40:28.011 --> 40:30.681
...when they found me...

40:32.140 --> 40:37.062
...after the doctors and
even my family had given up...

40:37.813 --> 40:40.899
...I experienced something
I never told you about.

40:42.067 --> 40:44.987
Even now it's hard to find the words.

40:47.072 --> 40:49.783
But there's one thing I'm certain of.

40:50.659 --> 40:53.537
As certain as I am of this life.

40:54.705 --> 40:57.416
We have nothing to fear when it's over.

41:00.919 --> 41:03.005
I'm so tired.

41:04.089 --> 41:06.425
You should sleep.

41:15.142 --> 41:21.106
Agent Fox Mulder lost consciousness at
approximately 4.30 this morning, 12 March.

41:21.190 --> 41:23.859
There is nothing more I can do for him.

41:23.942 --> 41:25.819
Or for myself.

41:25.903 --> 41:31.783
Supplies are exhausted. No food
or liquid consumed for over 24 hours.

41:31.867 --> 41:37.706
The outer hull most probably flooded, though
for now the inner hull is supporting the ship.

41:37.789 --> 41:43.504
Among Halvorsen's belongings
I found a children's book of Norse legends.

41:43.587 --> 41:47.549
From what I can tell,
the pictures show the end of the world.

41:47.633 --> 41:52.346
Not in a sudden firestorm of damnation,
as the Bible teaches us...

41:52.429 --> 41:56.767
...but in a slow-covering blanket of snow.

41:56.850 --> 42:01.230
First the moon and the stars
will be lost in a dense, white fog.

42:01.313 --> 42:05.359
Then the rivers and the lakes
and the sea will freeze over.

42:05.442 --> 42:10.864
And finally, a wolf named Skoll
will open his jaws and eat the sun...

42:11.323 --> 42:14.868
...sending the world into an everlasting night.

42:15.577 --> 42:18.497
I think I hear the wolf at the door.

43:14.845 --> 43:17.055
Agent Scully?

43:17.139 --> 43:19.433
Agent Scully, can you hear me?

43:20.559 --> 43:22.769
Mm, yeah.

43:22.853 --> 43:25.147
It's been 36 hours since your rescue.

43:25.230 --> 43:28.567
I've got you on dialysis with a high-flux filter.

43:30.569 --> 43:33.155
You're obviously responding well.

43:33.238 --> 43:36.241
Your electrolytes
are almost back to normal...

43:36.325 --> 43:39.328
...and your fluid status has been corrected.

43:41.788 --> 43:43.957
Mulder? Where is he?

43:45.918 --> 43:49.713
His endocrine system
was more compromised than yours.

43:49.796 --> 43:54.301
Frankly, we didn't think that he'd make it.
Until we discovered this.

43:58.222 --> 44:03.644
Based on your notes, we're giving him
synthetic hormones, which seem to work.

44:03.727 --> 44:08.732
Whatever caused this is still out there.
I have to talk to a naval liaison.

44:08.815 --> 44:13.070
- We have to salvage the ship...
- Agent Scully, the ship was taking on water.

44:13.153 --> 44:16.698
It sank less than an hour
after you were rescued.

44:32.196 --> 44:38.865
