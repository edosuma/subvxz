00:36.509 --> 00:41.810
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:42.280 --> 00:45.979
(Vice-chairwoman Park Ji Yeong)

01:03.469 --> 01:04.540
Hey, you.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.040
Are you looking down on me?

01:08.140 --> 01:10.510
Do you think you can just kick my wife and child out of the house?

01:16.109 --> 01:18.079
Jae Gu! What are you doing?

01:18.579 --> 01:21.090
- Jae Gu, don't. - Mark my words.

01:21.519 --> 01:23.319
I'll kill this woman today and go to jail.

01:23.590 --> 01:25.260
- Let go! Don't stop me! - Try to kill me!

01:25.819 --> 01:28.060
Try to kill me! Go on!

01:28.530 --> 01:30.799
Kill me!

01:40.239 --> 01:45.310
(Emergency medical care)

01:54.650 --> 01:56.420
What do you think you're doing?

01:56.450 --> 01:57.719
I won't let you come in.

01:57.719 --> 01:59.689
Don't listen to her. Go on.

02:00.390 --> 02:02.390
Eat after you've moved everything.

02:03.829 --> 02:05.260
And move all the stuff in that room.

02:05.329 --> 02:06.359
- That one? - Yes.

02:06.599 --> 02:09.229
- Where to? - To the small room over there.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.370
- Move all the stuff over there. - Okay, ma'am.

02:14.039 --> 02:15.770
Let's talk after they finish moving.

02:16.439 --> 02:17.909
Hey!

02:18.509 --> 02:21.710
You surely know that this house is under my daughter's name.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.219
Yes, I do. That's why I am taking action.

02:25.280 --> 02:28.090
You shouldn't do such a thing...

02:28.150 --> 02:29.620
when the owner has changed.

02:30.889 --> 02:34.030
I was wondering where Yun Seong Hui got her lack of common sense.

02:34.389 --> 02:35.460
I guess she got it from you.

02:35.629 --> 02:37.699
- What did you say? - Shouldn't you stop...

02:37.699 --> 02:40.870
her ridiculous behavior,

02:41.069 --> 02:42.900
especially when she's young and talented?

02:43.270 --> 02:45.069
- Hey! - I'll explain the situation...

02:45.439 --> 02:48.069
clearly that your daughter and yourself have got into,

02:48.069 --> 02:50.110
and I will tell you what to do from now.

02:50.180 --> 02:51.439
What?

02:51.439 --> 02:53.449
Your daughter is a lover...

02:53.580 --> 02:56.849
of my unworthy husband.

02:56.919 --> 02:58.250
What? Lover?

02:58.550 --> 03:00.789
People normally call them,

03:00.949 --> 03:02.389
bad concubines!

03:03.050 --> 03:04.490
- You! - Hey!

03:05.159 --> 03:07.159
How dare you call me that!

03:07.360 --> 03:10.830
I'm not a person that you can talk down to.

03:14.530 --> 03:16.900
To what country does Dokdo belong to?

03:17.469 --> 03:20.639
What's this nonsense?

03:21.240 --> 03:22.710
It belongs to Korea of course.

03:23.740 --> 03:27.180
Then how can you claim that this house is your daughter's?

03:28.180 --> 03:32.080
If you have any conscience, think about who this house belongs to.

03:32.419 --> 03:37.719
Do you think it's yours because it has your name on it?

03:37.719 --> 03:41.729
Speak up. Do you really think that this is your home? Do you really?

03:43.699 --> 03:45.900
What does this house have anything to do with Dokdo?

03:46.030 --> 03:50.039
It's the same, since having a flag on it...

03:50.599 --> 03:51.599
makes it seem like it's yours.

03:56.009 --> 03:58.580
- Were you really going to stab her? - No. Of course not.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.280
I didn't ask you.

04:00.349 --> 04:02.780
Yes. I was.

04:02.849 --> 04:04.949
- Jae Gu! - So, you were going to stab her...

04:05.719 --> 04:08.090
Did you mean to kill her?

04:08.319 --> 04:09.349
Yes.

04:09.719 --> 04:11.360
- Then this is attempted murder. - Detective.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.189
Jae Gu is so angry that he doesn't realize what he's saying.

04:15.330 --> 04:17.230
If you write everything he says in that report...

04:19.560 --> 04:20.600
Excuse me.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.740
What?

04:24.399 --> 04:27.310
What did you say? A Jin broke into your house?

04:28.939 --> 04:31.839
Is your mother with you?

04:35.050 --> 04:36.209
Ji Hu is not home, is she?

04:37.319 --> 04:38.649
Goodness. That's a relief.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.189
I am busy right now.

04:42.420 --> 04:44.189
How can I take care of things over there?

04:44.189 --> 04:46.620
I will make everything more complicated.

04:47.730 --> 04:50.529
Hey! How come you call the police for such thing?

04:51.129 --> 04:52.829
They are busy, you know.

04:53.300 --> 04:56.670
How can you let the police meddle in such small family matters?

04:57.040 --> 04:58.600
What? The police have arrived?

04:59.600 --> 05:00.610
My goodness.

05:03.639 --> 05:07.079
Hey! Hello?

05:09.550 --> 05:10.550
The police have arrived.

05:11.649 --> 05:14.350
- You pathetic fool! - You call me a pathetic fool?

05:14.490 --> 05:16.149
You don't deserve to call me pathetic.

05:16.220 --> 05:17.990
Are you cheating? Pathetic.

05:18.060 --> 05:21.860
Hey! Go home and quarrel.

05:22.430 --> 05:26.060
If the action was carried out on purpose,

05:26.360 --> 05:28.199
it qualifies as an attempted murder.

05:28.269 --> 05:30.470
Even if the murder was stopped.

05:30.839 --> 05:32.639
So make a settlement, at least.

05:33.339 --> 05:35.740
I will not settle.

05:36.439 --> 05:37.540
No, he will.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.610
Yes? Yes.

05:41.610 --> 05:44.449
Mr. Ahn called for a settlement...

05:44.449 --> 05:47.189
Nonsense. How rude.

05:47.620 --> 05:50.689
Tell him to come and beg for forgiveness.

05:53.790 --> 05:57.060
- Gosh. - You need to come and beg...

05:57.129 --> 05:59.300
I think my hips are dislocated.

05:59.430 --> 06:02.470
- Gosh! Hey, Mr. Park. - Yes?

06:02.470 --> 06:05.139
Let me talk to the head of the factory.

06:05.569 --> 06:09.209
I am worried sick that the factory may not be running properly.

06:11.339 --> 06:15.050
- Ma'am! - Every movement hurts like hell.

06:15.180 --> 06:17.720
Something must be wrong. Goodness.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.800
I came to visit Woo A Jin's residence.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.560
What's the building and room number?

06:32.860 --> 06:34.129
Right. It's...

06:36.199 --> 06:38.899
It's building 105, room 303.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.069
Look at this property certificate!

06:41.139 --> 06:43.379
The owner of this property is my daughter.

06:43.540 --> 06:46.240
This woman is moving in without her permission.

06:47.879 --> 06:50.050
The first owner of this property is Ahn Jae Seok.

06:50.350 --> 06:52.480
This person is my husband,

06:53.120 --> 06:54.920
but he had an affair with her.

06:55.490 --> 06:59.120
So, he unlawfully put her name to this property.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.589
Do you understand the situation?

07:01.689 --> 07:04.959
Well it is my duty to solve this, since we're here.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.870
Honestly, the owner of this property is...

07:08.870 --> 07:10.240
under this woman so it's her house.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.439
That's not necessarily true.

07:14.170 --> 07:15.170
Hello.

07:15.370 --> 07:17.410
I am attorney Kang Gi Ho.

07:18.209 --> 07:21.350
If you run into a ridiculous incident,

07:21.480 --> 07:22.509
call me.

07:23.680 --> 07:28.089
I'm the legal consultant of the actual owner of this house, her.

07:28.819 --> 07:31.759
There is currently a lawsuit concerning...

07:31.759 --> 07:33.019
the possession of this house.

07:33.790 --> 07:37.129
It's currently under dispute.

07:37.829 --> 07:41.000
In other words, we have yet...

07:41.000 --> 07:42.730
to decide who the trespasser is.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.269
So, the police have no right to decide who the owner is.

07:45.569 --> 07:48.339
Well, it seems like we shouldn't get ourselves involved.

07:49.170 --> 07:52.810
Since this is a family matter, sue her instead of calling the police.

07:53.079 --> 07:54.079
Goodbye.

07:54.610 --> 07:56.779
- Hey. - Take care!

07:58.819 --> 08:00.889
- Take this. - You didn't have to.

08:02.620 --> 08:04.920
So thoughtful of you. You bought the best tissue paper.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.660
- Did you finish moving everything? - Still a long way to go.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.060
Ma'am, where should I put this bed?

08:10.199 --> 08:12.100
Put that in the main bedroom.

08:12.430 --> 08:13.769
What about the bed in the main bedroom?

08:15.100 --> 08:16.629
I will help you move it.

08:17.069 --> 08:21.269
Will you? Then please move it to the corner room over there.

08:21.870 --> 08:23.240
Let's move this together.

08:26.810 --> 08:29.250
So, Ms. Woo is moving into that house?

08:29.310 --> 08:31.850
Yes. I need to get going.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.120
They're moving.

08:33.519 --> 08:36.149
Oh my. She is strong.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.590
She insisted on moving in? Unbelievable.

08:38.860 --> 08:41.529
Did you know that Ms. Park ended up in the hospital?

08:41.830 --> 08:43.529
- Why? - Why do you think it is?

08:43.899 --> 08:46.159
Chairman Ahn's oldest son went on a rampage in her office.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.399
My goodness.

08:47.399 --> 08:50.639
Did they find the person who beat up Kim Bong Sik, the golfer?

08:51.500 --> 08:54.240
Everyone is dismissed! Lunchtime is over.

08:54.809 --> 08:58.440
The ladies will be wondering what we're doing here.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.980
Go back to your workplaces.

09:00.049 --> 09:02.210
I heard the wife of Bong Sik got pregnant.

09:02.980 --> 09:05.279
Gosh, really? I thought they couldn't have a baby.

09:05.279 --> 09:08.250
Yes. But suddenly she has a baby.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.919
Then who's the father?

09:12.659 --> 09:15.190
It can't be Dr. Jang.

09:16.230 --> 09:17.259
Then what happened?

09:17.299 --> 09:19.600
Blocked caller ID. Your wife is pregnant.

09:28.409 --> 09:31.940
I received a ridiculous message. Do you know anything about it?

09:34.980 --> 09:38.820
It isn't true, is it?

09:40.690 --> 09:41.690
It is.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.960
- What? - It turns out that I'm fertile.

09:46.789 --> 09:48.429
- You... - Yun Jae!

09:50.330 --> 09:53.399
You couldn't get me pregnant, but he could.

09:53.730 --> 09:56.330
It seems that you were the problem.

09:57.899 --> 09:59.539
It turns out that I'm not infertile.

10:01.669 --> 10:04.409
Are you sure that Yun Jae is your son?

10:04.710 --> 10:05.740
Mom!

10:06.379 --> 10:07.710
My son.

10:11.519 --> 10:14.549
You ate chocolate again, didn't you? Did you brush your teeth afterward?

10:14.850 --> 10:18.519
Look at this. Do you want to go to the dentist again?

10:18.720 --> 10:22.429
- No. - Then you should brush your teeth.

10:22.730 --> 10:25.399
Check with me again after you've brushed your teeth. Okay?

10:25.899 --> 10:27.429
Good boy. Go on.

10:31.870 --> 10:33.269
Who was the fool?

10:33.639 --> 10:36.340
Is that important? It's not your business, since it's not your kid.

10:37.879 --> 10:40.649
We're neither married nor enemies.

10:41.610 --> 10:42.809
It's just weird between us.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.320
We need closure,

10:45.950 --> 10:48.419
and it seems like we're getting one.

10:48.549 --> 10:51.690
Gosh. You don't even seem scared.

10:52.159 --> 10:55.289
You've become bold these days. The fool must be wealthy.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.360
Watch your language.

10:57.730 --> 11:00.570
Even a worm will react when you step on it.

11:01.769 --> 11:04.740
Shut up before I show Yun Jae the video,

11:05.539 --> 11:06.970
and do as I say.

11:17.620 --> 11:19.919
Goodness. I'm so tired.

11:21.950 --> 11:22.990
Dad.

11:23.149 --> 11:25.389
I want plastic surgery.

11:26.159 --> 11:28.289
You don't need one. You're perfect.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.629
My eyes are turning back.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.129
I want to redo the double eyelid surgery.

11:34.269 --> 11:36.070
You don't need to. You're pretty.

11:40.110 --> 11:43.539
I'll introduce you to an acquaintance of mine...

11:43.679 --> 11:45.679
who's a plastic surgeon. Get it done there.

11:48.179 --> 11:49.750
- Thank you, dad. - Okay.

11:51.779 --> 11:52.779
Okay.

11:53.350 --> 11:55.750
Okay. Go on.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.759
- You're coming this evening, right? - I can't.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.529
I need to go home.

12:01.559 --> 12:02.559
Okay.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.269
You needed to see me? What's the matter?

12:09.399 --> 12:10.399
Mun Tak.

12:12.639 --> 12:15.139
My wife is pregnant.

12:15.570 --> 12:19.210
Gosh! Good for you! A late child. Good job.

12:19.340 --> 12:20.379
It's not my child.

12:21.610 --> 12:22.610
What?

12:23.149 --> 12:24.149
Mun Tak,

12:25.120 --> 12:26.220
help me.

12:26.950 --> 12:28.889
What did you say? That crazy fool.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.820
Who is he to behave like that over there?

12:31.490 --> 12:33.990
I can't forgive that punk this time!

12:34.860 --> 12:37.830
Mark my words. I will never forgive him.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.899
That son of a gun. I will put him in jail.

12:46.269 --> 12:48.769
Honey. Are you all right?

12:50.610 --> 12:51.980
You are such an angel.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.149
Okay. I'll visit you soon.

12:55.980 --> 12:56.980
Okay.

13:00.389 --> 13:02.620
At least you should go and beg for mercy.

13:02.889 --> 13:05.919
Despite your inhumane actions,

13:06.090 --> 13:07.389
she told me to show you mercy.

13:08.289 --> 13:10.129
She also told me to forgive your husband.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.470
She's totally different from you two shameful human beings.

13:25.039 --> 13:27.779
Jin Hee, did my mom finish moving?

13:29.649 --> 13:32.480
I want to live there too. Can't I?

13:34.190 --> 13:35.220
You can’t.

13:35.820 --> 13:37.389
You just stay at grandma's.

13:37.889 --> 13:41.190
But, no one is on her side. I should be with her.

13:42.629 --> 13:45.899
Ji Hu, think about how she would feel.

13:46.529 --> 13:49.700
She wouldn't want you to come to such a place.

13:50.370 --> 13:52.840
Okay. I understand.

13:53.970 --> 13:57.240
But from now on, do I have to hate my dad...

13:57.379 --> 13:58.509
or forgive him?

14:01.480 --> 14:02.509
I don't know.

14:02.850 --> 14:06.080
It’s your decision, but it's a hard one.

14:07.320 --> 14:10.220
Those kinds of decisions are hard to make, right?

14:13.529 --> 14:14.529
Ji Hu.

14:14.929 --> 14:17.659
Jin Hee, I am so sad.

14:29.909 --> 14:32.080
I feel so sorry for my mom.

14:32.909 --> 14:34.549
It must be hard to be alone.

14:36.850 --> 14:40.049
Actually, I like the leader of our class,

14:40.690 --> 14:42.019
Ji Hun Choi.

14:42.649 --> 14:45.519
I get so angry even...

14:45.820 --> 14:47.259
when he smiles at other girls.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.159
How hard would it be for mom?

14:50.500 --> 14:54.299
She couldn't even tell me that she's angry with him.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.769
Ji Hu, don't cry.

15:05.039 --> 15:07.649
My dad crossed the line.

15:08.779 --> 15:11.750
But I can't hate him,

15:12.950 --> 15:15.620
because that'll make my mom sadder.

15:17.559 --> 15:19.889
Your father is so lucky...

15:20.960 --> 15:22.730
to have a daughter like you.

15:23.960 --> 15:27.500
Don't tell mom that I cried.

15:28.269 --> 15:29.269
Of course.

15:29.700 --> 15:30.970
Promise me.

15:38.679 --> 15:41.279
My little puppy, did you come back from school?

15:41.850 --> 15:44.279
- Yes, grandma. - Go and wash your hands.

15:44.350 --> 15:47.090
- I bought doughnuts for you to eat. - Okay.

15:48.549 --> 15:51.759
Ji Hu has science lessons later this evening. I'll pick her up then.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.690
Jin Hee. Are you leaving?

15:53.960 --> 15:56.129
Yes. I need to help A Jin move.

15:57.330 --> 15:58.759
Let's talk for a minute.

16:02.370 --> 16:04.500
What? Is that true?

16:05.639 --> 16:08.909
Yes. She doesn't want you to know.

16:09.039 --> 16:10.340
So you should pretend.

16:10.409 --> 16:13.679
How can she expect to hide something like this? I'm not stupid.

16:14.250 --> 16:17.350
If she's moving because of Ji Hu's new school,

16:17.679 --> 16:21.490
keeping her here doesn't make any sense.

16:22.019 --> 16:23.820
How can she think that I wouldn't find out?

16:25.620 --> 16:27.389
I will end that fool.

16:27.929 --> 16:30.129
I think you'll have to kneel.

16:30.429 --> 16:31.629
Who? Me?

16:31.830 --> 16:35.730
No. Your brother, Jae Gu.

16:35.929 --> 16:39.570
She insisted that she won't settle until Jae Gu kneels before her.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.039
How can he kneel?

16:42.340 --> 16:45.039
A man shouldn't kneel so easily.

16:48.879 --> 16:49.879
Mother.

16:51.320 --> 16:54.419
Is that true? It isn't true, is it?

16:54.919 --> 16:58.389
Is it true that A Jin is going through such pain?

16:59.120 --> 17:00.629
Is it true...

17:00.889 --> 17:03.429
that you cheated on my daughter and went on to live with her?

17:04.160 --> 17:05.858
Is it true? Is it?

17:09.799 --> 17:13.098
My gosh! You fool!

17:13.608 --> 17:15.470
How can you do this?

17:15.710 --> 17:18.410
What did you say when you came to me, asking to marry my daughter?

17:18.980 --> 17:21.650
You told me that you will not let a single tear drop from her eyes.

17:22.549 --> 17:23.920
Mother. Well...

17:24.819 --> 17:26.049
Things took...

17:27.250 --> 17:28.920
an unexpected turn.

17:29.319 --> 17:32.990
How can you let her cry?

17:34.529 --> 17:36.799
Mother, I am sorry.

17:37.029 --> 17:38.630
It's all my fault.

17:43.640 --> 17:47.210
But, I won't divorce her.

17:49.640 --> 17:51.210
- What? - I'll never divorce her.

17:51.339 --> 17:52.779
Help me, Mother.

17:53.710 --> 17:55.049
I'll protect our family.

17:55.349 --> 17:58.779
Are you saying you'll break up with her?

17:59.319 --> 18:00.650
No. Not that.

18:00.890 --> 18:03.690
What? You crazy fool!

18:05.089 --> 18:06.160
Hey, get up!

18:06.259 --> 18:08.630
- Get up! - Mr. Ahn!

18:08.759 --> 18:10.359
- Get up! - Ma'am, stop...

18:10.359 --> 18:12.359
- Won't you get up? - Ma'am...

18:12.400 --> 18:14.470
- Are you putting on a show? Get up! - Mr. Ahn!

18:15.299 --> 18:17.769
I'll be going back to my office then.

18:17.839 --> 18:19.400
Okay. Thank you so much for today.

18:19.799 --> 18:20.839
No problem.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.910
Why don't we have the mind study session here?

18:25.109 --> 18:27.250
- It'll be a housewarming party too. - That sounds great.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.880
- I'm leaving now. - Okay. Bye.

18:30.950 --> 18:31.950
Bye.

18:35.150 --> 18:38.420
The lawyer has left. Let's go outside and argue with her.

18:38.789 --> 18:39.789
Argue for what?

18:39.789 --> 18:41.660
She's alone now.

18:42.390 --> 18:45.230
We need to do something. We can't give up.

18:45.599 --> 18:48.529
- Let's go. - No. Mom.

18:49.029 --> 18:50.200
Let's go.

18:53.609 --> 18:54.640
Goodness.

18:55.470 --> 18:56.509
Gosh. This is...

18:59.410 --> 19:02.210
Hey, you! Come out!

19:12.490 --> 19:15.259
We thought about it,

19:15.660 --> 19:17.259
but this is wrong.

19:17.900 --> 19:21.700
I let you go because I needed some time to think,

19:21.869 --> 19:24.940
but this house belongs to my daughter.

19:27.269 --> 19:29.240
You're laughing? Why are you laughing?

19:30.339 --> 19:34.279
Ma'am, this is a house that my husband and I bought together.

19:34.480 --> 19:37.480
It's under my husband's name, but it's shared property.

19:37.779 --> 19:40.920
My husband and I are in a lawsuit for divorce,

19:41.119 --> 19:43.789
so there are unresolved disputes concerning the division of assets.

19:44.859 --> 19:47.690
Thus, 50 percent of this property belongs to me.

19:47.690 --> 19:50.099
Your daughter doesn't own a single percent of this property.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.700
I don't know about that.

19:53.769 --> 19:55.829
Get out! Empty your room!

19:56.269 --> 19:57.269
Empty what?

19:58.539 --> 19:59.539
Mom!

20:02.710 --> 20:05.839
I thought it was strange of you...

20:06.039 --> 20:07.579
to leave Ji Hu when you moved out.

20:08.279 --> 20:10.349
I never would have guessed that this would happen.

20:13.950 --> 20:15.019
Mom, go.

20:15.519 --> 20:18.119
A Jin. There are guests here.

20:18.420 --> 20:21.160
Go buy some briskets, so that I can cook meat soup for the guests.

20:21.559 --> 20:23.900
Radish and leeks too.

20:24.099 --> 20:25.500
What do you mean "guests"?

20:25.829 --> 20:28.529
Go on! I want to have it.

20:29.970 --> 20:32.440
You like meat soup, don't you?

20:33.839 --> 20:35.309
Do you want some fiddleheads in it too?

20:35.869 --> 20:39.380
Fiddleheads in meat soup? That's so country-like!

20:39.680 --> 20:40.710
Okay then.

20:41.579 --> 20:42.779
Forget the fiddleheads,

20:42.910 --> 20:45.750
and get some fresh shiitake mushrooms and bean sprouts.

20:46.420 --> 20:48.490
We should tend to our guests.

20:50.359 --> 20:52.720
Go on. Listen to your mom!

20:55.660 --> 20:56.700
Okay.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.450
You witch. How dare you set foot on this property.

21:19.650 --> 21:22.650
- Do you want to die? - You crazy old woman!

21:22.789 --> 21:24.319
How dare you hit my daughter?

21:25.390 --> 21:28.089
- What? Old woman? - Oh gosh!

21:28.089 --> 21:30.029
A mother should deal with another mother.

21:30.029 --> 21:32.299
I'll punish you for not raising your kid properly!

21:32.329 --> 21:34.529
- You shameless woman. - Hey!

21:36.200 --> 21:39.339
I am planning on being evil for the first time in my life,

21:39.339 --> 21:42.910
after trying to raise my daughter as an elegant and dignified woman.

21:43.210 --> 21:45.240
You will get punished for what you've done.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.980
Let go!

21:49.250 --> 21:50.549
Jin Hee! Take her away.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.950
- Which one? - The young one!

21:53.079 --> 21:55.150
- Goodness! - Hey!

22:00.630 --> 22:02.630
Are you all insane?

22:02.789 --> 22:04.700
How dare you make a fuss on someone else's property.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.630
I heard that you're hospitalized for six weeks.

22:37.059 --> 22:38.259
You aren't going to settle, are you?

22:39.299 --> 22:41.799
If a child misbehaves,

22:41.799 --> 22:44.069
a mother should educate him.

22:45.269 --> 22:47.140
That's what a real mother would do.

22:48.970 --> 22:49.970
Don't you think?

22:50.440 --> 22:51.440
Mother?

22:52.140 --> 22:56.049
I don't know who'll kill you, but it'll happen sooner or later.

22:56.819 --> 22:59.119
If you keep living like that, there will be no mercy on you.

23:04.960 --> 23:07.329
We were at this cafe...

23:07.730 --> 23:08.829
when I gave you the job, right?

23:10.660 --> 23:12.960
Didn't I give you 100,000 dollars?

23:14.130 --> 23:16.069
I remember it clearly.

23:16.230 --> 23:17.970
I gave you 100,000 dollars in cash.

23:18.839 --> 23:20.039
Don't you remember?

23:22.109 --> 23:23.140
I...

23:25.940 --> 23:27.410
- remember. - Give it back.

23:28.609 --> 23:29.609
You failed, didn't you?

23:31.019 --> 23:34.089
You told me that you would.

23:35.119 --> 23:36.589
That you'd give it back if you fail.

23:39.089 --> 23:42.259
Ma'am, sorry. Stop this.

23:42.690 --> 23:44.359
- Stop what? - Stop this.

23:44.359 --> 23:46.029
Why are you doing this? You haven't met me before.

23:46.529 --> 23:49.369
When did I ever meet you and receive money?

23:52.500 --> 23:54.410
I am thinking about how I'm going to use this.

23:55.509 --> 23:57.710
You should be thinking too.

24:07.420 --> 24:08.450
My goodness.

24:09.019 --> 24:10.660
That stupid fool.

24:11.690 --> 24:12.690
Can't do anything right.

24:15.059 --> 24:17.359
Since the victim is in bad condition,

24:17.859 --> 24:20.329
and the perpetrator might seek revenge,

24:20.970 --> 24:22.230
I asked for...

24:22.599 --> 24:25.069
an arrest warrant for the aggressor.

24:25.839 --> 24:26.839
Please settle this quickly.

24:28.269 --> 24:31.140
I won't settle. Lock me up.

24:31.509 --> 24:32.609
I'll live in prison.

24:36.849 --> 24:38.349
This is Team Two of Homicide.

24:40.289 --> 24:41.289
What?

24:41.720 --> 24:43.490
Five women are fighting each other?

24:54.200 --> 24:57.700
A Jin, the neighbors called the police.

24:57.869 --> 24:59.400
My goodness! What?

25:00.769 --> 25:01.839
Did you keep them alive?

25:01.970 --> 25:04.109
They are alive. Don't worry.

25:04.710 --> 25:06.980
- We should deal with the police... - Gosh!

25:07.450 --> 25:09.109
My goodness.

25:09.609 --> 25:13.250
Didn't you see this coming when your husband cheated on you?

25:13.890 --> 25:16.720
How come he wants the house...

25:16.920 --> 25:18.420
after all he has done.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.730
Your mom wants meat soup.

25:25.299 --> 25:28.369
I will cook it in Gyeongsang Province style.

25:35.809 --> 25:37.710
Who's the perpetrator, and who's the victim?

25:38.640 --> 25:40.250
Just leave. It's a family matter.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.549
Why are we investigating this if it's just a family matter?

25:46.380 --> 25:47.420
What's going on over there?

25:50.220 --> 25:52.589
Gosh! Why is the password changed?

25:57.900 --> 26:00.900
- What are you doing here? - What brings you here?

26:02.000 --> 26:03.170
This is my home.

26:04.299 --> 26:05.339
Pardon?

26:06.539 --> 26:08.369
- Take care. - Okay.

26:08.509 --> 26:09.769
You must be happy to pay taxes,

26:10.440 --> 26:13.380
since you seem to make the most out of it.

26:13.750 --> 26:17.220
I never evade taxes, even though I break all the other laws.

26:17.480 --> 26:18.519
I pay my taxes fully.

26:21.289 --> 26:22.289
Goodness.

26:22.349 --> 26:24.119
Goodbye.

26:39.869 --> 26:42.539
How are we all gathered here?

26:43.480 --> 26:44.579
Did you invite everyone here?

26:47.450 --> 26:48.809
Hello. Good to meet you.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.380
Jae Seok!

26:51.420 --> 26:55.250
How can you let this happen?

26:55.650 --> 26:57.559
What? Son-in-law?

26:58.920 --> 27:00.359
I'm sorry for this, Mother.

27:00.859 --> 27:01.859
You're sorry?

27:02.359 --> 27:04.160
Who are you apologizing to?

27:06.130 --> 27:08.029
Sorry.

27:08.329 --> 27:11.799
Who do you think is the most unethical person among them?

27:15.009 --> 27:18.809
Who do you think is the most sorrowful person among them?

27:20.549 --> 27:22.809
Sorry. I'm sorry.

27:26.150 --> 27:27.150
Well...

27:28.150 --> 27:30.359
How can this happen...

27:31.259 --> 27:33.589
I think Jae Seok is both...

27:34.259 --> 27:37.259
the most unethical and the most sorrowful.

27:38.900 --> 27:41.930
Do you think so? I think so too.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.670
Let's eat together.

27:50.140 --> 27:52.579
You should eat too. Jin Hee, come and sit.

27:52.779 --> 27:54.849
- Okay. - You should eat too.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.519
- Should I? - Where do you think you're sitting?

28:04.819 --> 28:07.230
They should have made food for us too.

28:07.460 --> 28:09.230
Food should be shared so that no one will be upset.

28:09.529 --> 28:12.059
We're already upset. We can't be more upset than we are now.

28:14.430 --> 28:17.700
I hate to be left out for food.

28:18.769 --> 28:20.470
Do you want to get something to eat outside?

28:20.539 --> 28:23.039
Outside? We need to stay here...

28:23.210 --> 28:27.349
or else she will get rid of all your belongings and paintings.

28:28.380 --> 28:29.480
What do we do?

28:30.079 --> 28:31.750
What is Jae Seok, my son-in-law doing?

28:31.980 --> 28:34.720
Why do you call him that? We're not married.

28:35.049 --> 28:37.819
Well, I have nothing else to call him.

28:38.359 --> 28:41.559
Gosh! What is he planning on doing?

28:43.559 --> 28:45.299
The smell of kimchi is...

28:46.900 --> 28:47.970
so good.

28:48.130 --> 28:49.769
There are too many orders for the Pungsuk kimchi,

28:49.769 --> 28:51.339
you need to wait a month.

28:52.039 --> 28:53.640
Yes. Sorry.

28:56.170 --> 28:58.440
Eating, sleeping, and fighting and...

28:58.740 --> 29:00.210
Eating, sleeping, and fighting again...

29:00.849 --> 29:02.180
That’s what life was.

29:02.779 --> 29:05.720
It was as if people were eating and sleeping to fight.

29:06.279 --> 29:09.390
That's what life was like.

29:11.660 --> 29:13.759
Ma'am, this is Pungsuk's Kitchen.

29:15.859 --> 29:18.630
I am sending you the kimchi, ginseng kimchi,

29:18.960 --> 29:20.799
and Pungsuk roes for the director.

29:21.970 --> 29:24.839
I selected all the ingredients myself, so don't worry and enjoy.

29:25.839 --> 29:29.240
I will take care of the director's dinner forever.

29:30.440 --> 29:33.240
- Okay. - Human desires are endless,

29:33.579 --> 29:36.150
but the most basic and powerful desire of all was...

29:36.309 --> 29:38.819
hunger, without a doubt.

29:39.079 --> 29:41.789
I heard a two-lane road on the way to Chilpo-ri will be constructed.

29:42.390 --> 29:44.119
Don't worry, the information is reliable.

29:45.220 --> 29:48.759
I bet the price of the land will go up.

29:49.859 --> 29:52.460
I'll buy it and refuse to sell it until they offer me a price.

29:53.900 --> 29:56.400
With the desire of hunger as her leverage,

29:56.470 --> 29:59.099
she was on her way to success.

30:03.339 --> 30:04.880
Why did you come home today?

30:05.279 --> 30:07.849
I'm going to come home every day until Do Hyeon goes abroad to study.

30:08.910 --> 30:10.319
You're such a good dad.

30:11.619 --> 30:13.279
Do you know that Gyeong Hui is pregnant?

30:14.819 --> 30:16.289
How do you know that?

30:18.660 --> 30:20.059
I heard that Bong Sik is not the father.

30:21.089 --> 30:23.190
Who's is it then?

30:25.099 --> 30:26.970
You must know since you two are close.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.329
I don't know.

30:30.099 --> 30:33.299
But are you and Bong Sik close enough to talk about such things?

30:34.309 --> 30:37.940
He wants to break the bones of the man who had an affair with his wife.

30:40.579 --> 30:42.250
You know who it is, don't you?

30:44.220 --> 30:45.549
I really don't know.

30:57.059 --> 30:58.130
Hello?

30:58.400 --> 31:01.670
- Hey, it's me. - What's up?

31:02.630 --> 31:05.940
My husband knows that Gyeong Hui is pregnant.

31:09.339 --> 31:10.809
How does he know?

31:11.039 --> 31:12.509
That's what I'm saying.

31:13.349 --> 31:15.579
I think Bong Sik told my husband.

31:17.019 --> 31:19.549
The problem is that the kid is...

31:20.089 --> 31:21.720
not Bong Sik's.

31:23.759 --> 31:25.119
- What? - Gi Ok.

31:25.789 --> 31:27.089
What do we do?

31:29.430 --> 31:33.130
Hang up, I need to collect my thoughts first.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.130
Oh my, am I getting prettier?

32:00.289 --> 32:01.460
Yes, you are.

32:01.630 --> 32:04.029
Come here. Let me give you a hug.

32:15.509 --> 32:17.809
Ji Hu, how was your day?

32:20.079 --> 32:21.180
I see.

32:22.109 --> 32:25.150
Okay. Did you take your vitamins?

32:27.220 --> 32:30.819
Okay. I love you too.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.799
A Jin. I am not going to divorce you.

32:42.630 --> 32:43.700
Shut your mouth.

32:43.839 --> 32:46.440
What I want is coexistence.

33:16.799 --> 33:19.900
Coexistence is what you wanted. How do you like it so far?

33:20.369 --> 33:22.339
This is not what I meant.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.240
Then?

33:37.259 --> 33:38.519
Don't ever go in!

33:39.390 --> 33:41.190
Your filthy mind and body...

33:41.759 --> 33:44.660
I don't want you to contaminate her. It's disgusting.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.059
Where do I sleep then?

33:47.029 --> 33:49.230
Here. You can walk, can't you? Go on.

33:49.900 --> 33:52.269
But this is wrong.

33:53.569 --> 33:56.109
You're the one to talk!

33:56.539 --> 33:58.009
It makes me very sick.

33:58.279 --> 33:59.609
Do you really have to do this?

33:59.910 --> 34:01.849
Look what you've done.

34:02.210 --> 34:04.549
Why do Ji Hu and I have to be separated,

34:04.680 --> 34:07.390
and be punished for something that you have done?

34:07.390 --> 34:08.420
Where is Ji Hu now?

34:08.518 --> 34:10.789
I am planning on bringing her when both of you leave.

34:11.059 --> 34:12.219
You are being unfair.

34:12.320 --> 34:13.789
I am being unfair? What about you?

34:14.630 --> 34:18.230
This is terrible. This is not the coexistence that I wanted.

34:18.929 --> 34:20.400
The divorce documents are registered.

34:20.730 --> 34:22.630
The court will send them to you soon.

34:23.268 --> 34:24.469
Prepare your answer form.

34:25.539 --> 34:28.570
You should hire a lawyer too. Don't you think?

34:37.780 --> 34:38.920
Come to the room.

34:45.159 --> 34:47.329
What is going on?

34:47.429 --> 34:49.630
I am the one who's having the hardest time here.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.659
- I can't live like this. - Me too.

34:52.159 --> 34:53.300
So, what's your plan?

34:53.630 --> 34:55.469
- Let's move to that house. - Which one?

34:55.829 --> 34:58.400
My home. The one where I used to live in.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.309
Why me? Why should I live there if I have this place?

35:01.369 --> 35:03.170
- Then what should I do? - Just divorce her.

35:03.710 --> 35:07.250
Split your assets and make her leave.

35:07.679 --> 35:08.710
Just give her the money.

35:08.849 --> 35:11.420
Divorce? I can't. I will not divorce her.

35:11.579 --> 35:14.590
I can't abandon my wife and my child.

35:16.619 --> 35:18.889
What about me? What do you expect me to do?

35:19.590 --> 35:20.829
I can't abandon you either.

35:21.760 --> 35:23.699
You greedy jerk.

35:24.099 --> 35:26.030
You greedy...

35:35.710 --> 35:37.510
Why did you come?

35:38.809 --> 35:39.840
Are you all right?

35:40.980 --> 35:42.010
Gosh.

35:42.110 --> 35:45.079
I can't bend my waist because it's twisted.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.719
It'll get better.

35:48.619 --> 35:50.960
I heard that you talked to the head of the factory...

35:51.559 --> 35:53.630
and started the production lines, in the midst of all this.

35:54.889 --> 35:56.260
I need to keep the company alive.

35:57.530 --> 36:00.929
I feel ashamed. I failed to raise my kids properly.

36:02.530 --> 36:04.699
- Honey. - Yes?

36:05.400 --> 36:08.309
Life doesn't always go as planned.

36:10.780 --> 36:12.840
Grass, grass, golden grass.

36:13.610 --> 36:16.150
There's a fire deep in the mountains.

36:16.780 --> 36:19.219
It's the golden grass near one's grave.

36:20.219 --> 36:23.460
Spring has come, the light of spring has come.

36:26.929 --> 36:30.599
You are greater than anyone.

36:31.530 --> 36:34.400
You're a person who memorized poems...

36:34.400 --> 36:35.929
by peeking into your friend's high school books.

36:36.769 --> 36:39.599
No one can do that except you.

36:42.670 --> 36:46.340
You have lived a good life so far.

36:48.349 --> 36:49.380
Thank you.

36:50.119 --> 36:52.920
I am happy at the end of my life because of you.

36:55.119 --> 36:56.619
If your waist heals,

36:57.320 --> 37:00.489
should we go on a cruise trip?

37:03.260 --> 37:05.730
We should keep the company alive.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.599
You worked hard for it.

37:08.230 --> 37:11.340
Okay, then. Do as you wish.

37:11.699 --> 37:15.170
But, did your second son move out?

37:15.440 --> 37:18.380
Don't even mention him. That crazy fool.

37:20.210 --> 37:23.079
I will go and meet A Jin again.

37:32.960 --> 37:33.960
Hey.

37:34.690 --> 37:35.730
What?

37:35.789 --> 37:37.730
What did Park Bok Ja do before?

37:39.130 --> 37:41.400
- What? - She has...

37:41.400 --> 37:42.429
a criminal record of fraud...

37:43.000 --> 37:44.940
There must be something more.

37:46.710 --> 37:47.769
What is it?

37:49.010 --> 37:50.610
How could I know?

37:50.739 --> 37:52.179
Use your head.

37:53.550 --> 37:56.010
If you keep dwelling near her,

37:56.409 --> 37:57.750
you'll get destroyed.

38:04.489 --> 38:06.190
I am a psychology professor.

38:08.389 --> 38:11.599
Looking through a person's mind is my expertise.

38:14.369 --> 38:18.139
Do you think Park Bok Ja will take care of you forever?

38:20.840 --> 38:22.639
Certainly not.

38:23.809 --> 38:28.150
She will use you and abandon you.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.389
Mark my words.

38:50.840 --> 38:55.170
One day at the sound of the leaves falling

38:55.510 --> 38:57.139
Let's all have a good day today!

38:57.380 --> 38:58.639
- Let's do it! - Let's do it!

38:58.710 --> 39:02.179
I saw my empty heart

39:04.980 --> 39:09.650
I felt the time

39:11.519 --> 39:16.630
Had passed by meaninglessly

39:16.730 --> 39:17.760
Be quiet!

39:18.460 --> 39:19.500
Shut up!

39:24.239 --> 39:29.869
I lived like an idiot

39:30.780 --> 39:34.380
I lived...

39:37.349 --> 39:42.550
I lived like an idiot

39:43.150 --> 39:47.559
Like an idiot, like an idiot

39:48.059 --> 39:53.059
I lived like an idiot

39:53.130 --> 39:54.300
My goodness.

39:54.670 --> 39:58.070
This is not the coexistence I wanted.

39:58.739 --> 40:01.469
Why are you giving me...

40:01.570 --> 40:03.940
such agony?

40:04.139 --> 40:05.510
Like an idiot

40:05.639 --> 40:06.880
Like an idiot

40:07.179 --> 40:08.380
Like an idiot

40:08.650 --> 40:10.780
Like an idiot

40:15.250 --> 40:17.519
I should be all right.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.829
Hello, Sir.

40:25.929 --> 40:27.300
It's me, Park Ji Yeong.

40:28.429 --> 40:30.070
Not at all.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.199
I am going to work right away.

40:34.039 --> 40:35.210
Yes.

40:36.679 --> 40:38.039
When shall we meet?

40:43.050 --> 40:44.250
Did you call me, sir?

40:44.619 --> 40:45.619
Sit.

40:49.449 --> 40:51.820
I need you to secretly follow someone.

40:52.820 --> 40:53.829
Follow?

40:56.429 --> 40:57.659
Do you mean your wife?

40:58.800 --> 41:00.699
- No. - Then who?

41:10.409 --> 41:12.380
Why did you want to see me?

41:12.579 --> 41:14.510
Order something. I have ordered already.

41:16.380 --> 41:17.579
One cup of Americano, please.

41:17.849 --> 41:19.650
Order something else. You're pregnant.

41:20.489 --> 41:22.650
A coffee while pregnant won't do any harm.

41:24.090 --> 41:27.059
I thought there would be no reason to see you again.

41:28.860 --> 41:29.860
Who's the father?

41:32.099 --> 41:35.130
Why do I have to tell you?

41:35.130 --> 41:36.699
Because I think it concerns me.

41:36.900 --> 41:39.070
No, it doesn't.

41:39.300 --> 41:42.510
You're saying that it's not my husband's child, right?

41:44.409 --> 41:48.380
Even if it is, it's my baby. So mind your own business.

42:11.670 --> 42:12.840
Honey.

42:22.909 --> 42:24.679
- Hyo Ju. - Hey.

42:25.320 --> 42:27.789
What brings you here?

42:28.750 --> 42:30.159
Who is she, honey?

42:33.019 --> 42:34.130
She's someone I know.

42:35.659 --> 42:36.730
Hello.

42:39.429 --> 42:41.000
- Let's go. - Oh, okay.

42:43.369 --> 42:45.369
Hyo Ju, I'm leaving.

42:54.718 --> 42:57.258
My husband knows that I am pregnant.

42:58.517 --> 43:00.787
You texted him, right?

43:02.088 --> 43:03.398
Why did you do such a thing?

43:03.858 --> 43:06.528
What if he harms...

43:07.427 --> 43:09.267
Dr. Jang out of anger?

43:09.327 --> 43:10.668
Have you considered an abortion?

43:11.838 --> 43:14.338
I can't believe you're saying that after having...

43:15.508 --> 43:17.307
- two children of your own. - I have a feeling...

43:18.037 --> 43:19.177
that my husband's the father.

43:19.278 --> 43:20.548
I'm going to raise him.

43:21.148 --> 43:23.517
So mind your own business.

43:23.577 --> 43:25.878
Why did you do that?

43:28.588 --> 43:29.887
How can you live like that?

43:33.688 --> 43:34.727
I was so...

43:36.028 --> 43:37.057
lonely.

43:38.497 --> 43:39.497
Just...

43:40.597 --> 43:42.597
so lonely.

43:53.807 --> 43:56.347
I heard that DNA tests can't be done during pregnancy.

43:57.977 --> 44:00.148
Let's do the test after the baby is born.

44:00.847 --> 44:03.688
If my husband's the father,

44:04.988 --> 44:06.017
I'll raise the baby.

44:07.758 --> 44:09.287
- What? - I will...

44:10.827 --> 44:12.698
- raise him. - You are out of your mind.

44:12.758 --> 44:16.327
So, don't divorce your own husband.

44:17.597 --> 44:19.537
- Why? - If you do,

44:20.407 --> 44:22.137
my husband might want you.

44:25.637 --> 44:29.008
You don't know your own husband.

44:29.378 --> 44:32.977
Your husband is not the romantic type.

44:33.787 --> 44:36.088
He might want me? You must be joking.

44:36.787 --> 44:38.957
You think too highly of your husband.

44:39.858 --> 44:43.597
Why did you text my husband then? What did you expect?

44:44.557 --> 44:47.668
I thought you don't want us to get divorced.

44:47.698 --> 44:48.727
I just wanted...

44:49.568 --> 44:51.968
to give your family a hard time.

44:52.968 --> 44:54.468
Why should I be the only one to suffer?

44:54.508 --> 44:57.838
What makes you think that I'm not suffering?

45:00.747 --> 45:02.608
I am having the hardest time among all.

45:05.117 --> 45:07.017
Both of us cheated,

45:08.117 --> 45:11.117
but why am I the only one carrying the burden?

45:12.188 --> 45:14.657
It's terribly unfair.

45:16.358 --> 45:17.358
Okay,

45:19.258 --> 45:20.427
I know what I did was wrong.

45:21.827 --> 45:23.497
I had an affair with your husband.

45:24.698 --> 45:25.698
But...

45:27.008 --> 45:30.378
I don't love him.

45:31.738 --> 45:34.378
So, don't worry.

45:41.218 --> 45:42.648
Why did this happen?

45:44.218 --> 45:47.088
Why must it be my husband? Why?

45:53.497 --> 45:55.267
Park Bok Ja is not going to settle.

45:55.898 --> 45:58.568
The court is going to issue an arrest warrant.

46:22.727 --> 46:23.758
It's me.

46:24.827 --> 46:26.097
Let's meet today.

46:28.298 --> 46:30.238
I was going to call you.

46:32.367 --> 46:34.168
Okay. See you there.

46:43.247 --> 46:45.148
Tell Ahn Jae Seok to come to my office.

46:45.177 --> 46:46.988
He's not here yet.

46:47.747 --> 46:48.787
What?

47:03.597 --> 47:04.838
- A Jin! - Hey.

47:05.637 --> 47:08.537
You must be busy. It's recruiting season for foreign airlines.

47:08.968 --> 47:11.037
Yes. I have a lot going on.

47:12.207 --> 47:13.847
- Jeong Hui. - Yes?

47:14.048 --> 47:16.948
I want to lecture. You told me that you needed help.

47:17.347 --> 47:18.878
- Lecture? - Yes.

47:21.918 --> 47:23.457
Why? No?

47:25.258 --> 47:28.088
The requirements for becoming a stewardess has...

47:28.157 --> 47:29.657
become stricter.

47:30.028 --> 47:31.698
A higher English exam score is needed too.

47:31.698 --> 47:34.028
English isn't taught by people with a stewardess background, right?

47:35.398 --> 47:37.867
You haven't been on an airplane for more than ten years.

47:38.037 --> 47:40.407
A long time has passed since then.

47:40.738 --> 47:42.537
People want lectures from a person with a fresh experience,

47:42.537 --> 47:44.438
not from an old person.

47:44.778 --> 47:46.608
All the airplanes have been renewed.

47:46.977 --> 47:49.108
The size of the overhead bins are different now.

47:50.318 --> 47:52.347
Old person? Hey!

47:53.488 --> 47:54.488
Yes?

47:55.847 --> 47:59.017
You can reject me because of my discontinued experience,

47:59.688 --> 48:02.557
but calling me an old woman is unacceptable!

48:02.927 --> 48:04.628
That's not what I meant.

48:04.657 --> 48:06.427
This is what you should've said,

48:07.028 --> 48:09.767
"There are too many lecturers with experience,"

48:09.767 --> 48:12.898
"I'm afraid that your chances may be slim."

48:15.608 --> 48:18.338
You are the head of a stewardess school,

48:19.977 --> 48:22.108
but how come your shoes are so pointy?

48:23.177 --> 48:25.218
Ok, fine. But keep in mind...

48:25.517 --> 48:27.648
that I teach much better than you.

48:28.247 --> 48:29.247
Don't you know that I was famous...

48:29.247 --> 48:31.188
for not receiving any complaints as a stewardess?

48:31.588 --> 48:32.918
Of course, I do.

48:32.988 --> 48:34.028
Goodbye.

48:41.398 --> 48:44.338
I just got rejected. I can't believe it.

48:45.938 --> 48:47.037
It doesn't feel good.

48:53.648 --> 48:56.648
Where did she buy those sunglasses? They look so pretty.

49:22.307 --> 49:24.608
Abandoning the title of the daughter-in-law of Daesung Pulp...

49:25.278 --> 49:26.378
Don't you have regrets about that?

49:26.677 --> 49:28.477
No, I don't.

49:32.148 --> 49:34.117
Ahn Jae Seok didn't come to work today.

49:36.048 --> 49:37.858
Please take good care of Daesung Pulp for me.

49:38.157 --> 49:40.887
I put in a lot of effort...

49:40.957 --> 49:42.628
into the company,

49:44.028 --> 49:46.457
so I think I deserve to say that.

49:47.668 --> 49:49.327
Are you really going through the divorce?

49:49.698 --> 49:50.698
Yes.

49:52.767 --> 49:55.838
Even if you do, will you help the company?

49:56.677 --> 50:00.177
No. I will find my own way.

50:01.247 --> 50:03.977
I put in a lot of thought into this decision.

50:05.918 --> 50:09.347
I'm not a type of person who changes her mind.

50:12.218 --> 50:14.457
That's why I wanted to see you.

50:15.588 --> 50:18.028
Let's help each other.

50:18.497 --> 50:20.968
We can't help each other.

50:23.128 --> 50:26.707
I don't seek what's not mine.

50:35.448 --> 50:36.448
Very well.

50:37.878 --> 50:40.648
I wish you good luck.

50:41.247 --> 50:44.657
I wish you would find your own true life,

50:45.017 --> 50:46.657
and not harm anyone.

51:02.367 --> 51:03.738
Get out of the company!

51:04.338 --> 51:05.938
- Father! - Don't make me say this again.

51:05.938 --> 51:07.948
- Get out! - That's not fair.

51:07.948 --> 51:09.347
How can you manage a company...

51:09.347 --> 51:10.548
if you can't even manage your own family?

51:10.878 --> 51:13.847
I didn't get enough sleep and I went cycling early in the morning.

51:13.847 --> 51:16.188
I was tired, so I didn't go to work.

51:16.347 --> 51:18.287
You can't skip work because you're tired.

51:18.988 --> 51:21.258
You must be out of your mind! Crazy fool.

51:21.588 --> 51:22.827
I will work hard from tomorrow.

51:22.927 --> 51:24.097
Enough! Get out.

51:24.727 --> 51:28.227
I will think about it, if you end your relationship with that woman.

51:29.398 --> 51:32.398
- I'm going home. - Who's living in your home?

51:32.898 --> 51:36.267
Who's your legal co-resident and who's your roommate?

51:36.367 --> 51:37.608
You son of a gun.

51:41.807 --> 51:42.907
Who could it be?

51:46.177 --> 51:47.218
A Jin, you're here.

51:51.157 --> 51:52.617
Let's go inside. Is Ji Hu home?

51:52.957 --> 51:55.427
No. She has violin lessons.

51:55.727 --> 51:56.758
She should be home now.

51:57.858 --> 52:00.867
This is not Gangnam. It takes time to get here.

52:02.298 --> 52:03.968
- Oh yes. - You must be hungry.

52:04.698 --> 52:06.137
Do you want some kimchi wraps?

52:07.767 --> 52:08.767
Mom.

52:11.307 --> 52:12.307
Why?

52:13.448 --> 52:15.008
I need to live well,

52:16.878 --> 52:17.878
but...

52:19.747 --> 52:21.318
things aren't going so well.

52:24.057 --> 52:25.088
Girl.

52:26.628 --> 52:29.787
If you did something wrong, I could show you a lesson.

52:30.858 --> 52:34.298
But you didn't do anything wrong. What can I possibly do to help?

52:37.338 --> 52:38.668
Sorry, mom.

52:42.367 --> 52:43.807
Life is like that.

52:45.307 --> 52:47.907
Life doesn't always go as planned.

52:51.718 --> 52:54.718
It really doesn't.

52:59.758 --> 53:01.758
My daughter. Cheer up!

53:05.827 --> 53:06.968
Okay.

53:11.968 --> 53:12.997
Mom!

53:16.878 --> 53:19.677
My princess! Did you have a good violin lesson?

53:20.247 --> 53:21.247
Yes.

53:23.108 --> 53:24.117
Ji Hu.

53:24.718 --> 53:27.648
You don't need to participate in the contest, if you don't want to.

53:29.148 --> 53:30.988
Mom. Did you cry?

53:32.157 --> 53:33.188
Sorry.

53:34.258 --> 53:37.957
I cried while I was talking to grandma.

53:39.358 --> 53:40.367
But...

53:41.698 --> 53:43.097
these are not tears of sadness.

53:44.597 --> 53:45.637
Really.

53:48.267 --> 53:49.307
Mom,

53:50.807 --> 53:52.037
you can cry.

53:52.738 --> 53:54.077
Just because you're an adult,

53:54.878 --> 53:57.617
you don't need to be strong in front of me.

53:58.718 --> 53:59.948
Just cry...

54:01.347 --> 54:03.818
Just cry when you want to.

54:04.218 --> 54:06.628
It's okay, mom.

54:18.968 --> 54:20.008
Mom.

54:21.008 --> 54:22.738
- Yes? - You have me.

54:24.077 --> 54:27.407
You have me next to you.

54:29.448 --> 54:32.077
Yes, I know.

54:37.387 --> 54:38.418
Oh, my baby.

54:39.858 --> 54:41.657
Oh, my baby.

54:49.528 --> 54:50.668
You won't settle?

54:51.738 --> 54:54.668
Chairman Ahn told me not to, saying that he needs to be taught a lesson.

54:55.707 --> 54:59.238
Then, is it okay for me to give this tape to my father-in-law?

54:59.738 --> 55:01.177
Help yourself.

55:03.008 --> 55:05.977
How can you prove that you didn't pay him for that tape?

55:08.117 --> 55:10.088
After all, you paid him 100,000 dollars to hit someone.

55:11.017 --> 55:14.957
It would be easy to pay him extra for a tape.

55:17.398 --> 55:21.097
You are the true devil.

55:22.267 --> 55:25.497
You are no match for me,

55:26.068 --> 55:28.207
so you shouldn't have started.

55:30.108 --> 55:32.037
Let's see who wins.

55:33.677 --> 55:35.008
Sure.

55:35.977 --> 55:39.218
Take care of your imprisoned husband for now.

55:40.048 --> 55:41.887
You're wasting my time by coming here.

56:02.938 --> 56:05.407
Your wife met this woman today.

56:06.807 --> 56:10.347
As you can see in the picture, they cried and sobbed together.

56:10.878 --> 56:11.918
Strange, isn't it?

56:12.878 --> 56:16.148
Isn't she the mother of my son's friend?

56:16.287 --> 56:18.988
Yes. She's the wife of Dr. Jang, the plastic surgeon.

56:22.528 --> 56:24.557
It doesn't seem like she's seeing a man.

56:25.427 --> 56:26.997
I'll have someone follow her.

56:30.767 --> 56:33.137
If I find out who the fool is,

56:33.338 --> 56:35.108
I am going to kill him with my bare hands.

56:35.668 --> 56:37.938
Bong Sik. What's your plan?

56:45.048 --> 56:47.017
I guess you have no choice but to divorce her.

56:47.488 --> 56:49.918
How can you live with a woman with someone else's child?

56:54.758 --> 56:58.358
My son is really loyal to her.

57:00.267 --> 57:02.528
That's a problem.

57:33.298 --> 57:36.938
There's a man living in a red house

57:37.438 --> 57:40.168
I'm not alone

57:40.738 --> 57:43.977
There's a man living in a red house

57:55.517 --> 57:56.548
Hello?

58:00.858 --> 58:02.387
I'm coming to see you.

58:03.188 --> 58:04.198
See you soon.

58:18.438 --> 58:19.438
Are you a pervert?

58:21.477 --> 58:23.008
I want to protect our love.

58:48.008 --> 58:50.278
(The Lady in Dignity)

58:50.677 --> 58:52.907
Then, what are your plans afterward?

58:53.008 --> 58:54.448
Don't ask me things like that anymore.

58:54.548 --> 58:57.177
Call me "Ma'am" even when it's just the two of us.

58:57.677 --> 59:00.287
Help me. Let my husband out of jail.

59:00.548 --> 59:01.617
Why should I do that?

59:01.787 --> 59:03.787
Is there a reason not to?

59:03.918 --> 59:06.988
I want to meet you from time to time.

59:07.927 --> 59:09.327
Okay. Let's do that.

59:09.588 --> 59:11.028
- Ahn Jae Seok? - I came all the way here...

59:11.128 --> 59:13.798
to meet you because I heard that you're a true lawyer...

59:13.867 --> 59:14.898
who defends the powerless.

59:14.927 --> 59:17.668
Unbelievable. There are so many lawyers in Seoul.

59:18.198 --> 59:19.867
Maybe he approached me intentionally.

59:20.307 --> 59:22.068
Hit and run.

59:22.407 --> 59:23.977
Daesung Pulp is perfect now.

59:24.537 --> 59:25.577
I will help you.

59:25.577 --> 59:28.608
Since the company is doing so well now, you should sell it...

59:28.807 --> 59:30.677
and keep the cash.

59:30.878 --> 59:32.517
Do you think I should sell the company?

59:32.747 --> 59:34.887
Do you want this? It's ruby.

59:35.148 --> 59:36.287
I think it will suit you.

59:36.418 --> 59:38.758
Thank you for calling me this afternoon.

59:38.858 --> 59:40.088
You don't even need to thank me.

59:40.088 --> 59:42.988
Keep on being my puppet and doing a good job at it.

59:42.988 --> 59:44.997
Don't be all confused and lame.

59:45.198 --> 59:46.927
That's how you can survive.

59:47.327 --> 59:50.537
We must not let her go any further or have her way.

59:50.738 --> 59:51.938
Cripple her.

59:52.137 --> 59:55.508
I'm not the person I used to be.

01:00:11.945 --> 01:00:17.773
