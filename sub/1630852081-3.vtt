00:11.386 --> 00:15.306
<i>'Twas a time close to Christmas</i>
<i>And through strands of twinkle lights</i>

00:15.390 --> 00:18.643
<i>Furnaces were cranked up</i>
<i>To 2,000 Fahrenheits</i>

00:18.727 --> 00:21.771
<i>Stockings had been hung</i>
<i>In the hot shop with care</i>

00:21.855 --> 00:24.941
<i>In hopes that glassblowers</i>
<i>Soon would be there</i>

00:25.900 --> 00:27.027
Ho ho ho!

00:27.110 --> 00:29.738
<i>Then Santa called out</i>
<i>From up and above</i>

00:29.821 --> 00:32.741
<i>To artists we all know and do love</i>

00:32.824 --> 00:33.908
This is it.

00:35.952 --> 00:39.664
<i> On, Andi, on, Cat</i>
<i>Edgar, Nao, and Alexander</i>

00:39.748 --> 00:42.542
<i>There is no time for you to meander</i>

00:42.625 --> 00:43.877
Best feeling ever.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.130
<i>For a chance to rewrite</i>
<i>Your own glass story</i>

00:47.213 --> 00:48.214
Sick!

00:48.298 --> 00:51.342
<i>This Christmas,</i>
<i>You'll blow for all the glory</i>

00:51.426 --> 00:52.886
Go big or go home.

00:53.386 --> 00:56.306
I'm Bobby Berk,
and it may be Festivus for the rest of us,

00:56.389 --> 00:58.224
but this is<i> Blown Away: Christmas</i>.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.985
Glassblowers, welcome back to the hot shop

01:09.069 --> 01:12.030
and the halfway mark
of our Christmas extravaganza.

01:12.113 --> 01:14.699
-Whoo!
-I'm still here!

01:15.867 --> 01:18.953
I feel like I'm just getting started,
and we're already halfway done.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.289
At this point, you each have
a one-in-three chance

01:21.372 --> 01:22.665
of making it to the finale.

01:23.249 --> 01:27.253
I'm the person that everyone wants
to get rid of right now, for sure.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.465
The only thing
standing in your way of becoming

01:30.548 --> 01:33.927
the<i> Blown Away: Christmas</i> Champion
is just two more challenges.

01:34.010 --> 01:36.513
Two more challenges, including today's.

01:36.596 --> 01:41.559
That is a tall order
with "tree-mendous" stakes.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.602
Cue the doors.

01:47.899 --> 01:51.569
I see three big-ass, kind of like

01:51.653 --> 01:55.698
mid-century-modern-looking
Christmas trees.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.033
Okay.

01:58.409 --> 01:59.452
Pretty tall.

01:59.536 --> 02:03.498
These have a lot of height.
They're each seven-and-a-half feet tall.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.043
They are daunting.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.129
Those are big.

02:09.212 --> 02:12.590
Bigger the better, right?

02:12.674 --> 02:15.301
-I'm glad it's not ten feet.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.888
Clearly, these trees
are looking pretty sad and bare,

02:18.972 --> 02:23.309
but that's where you guys come in.
Your job is to <i>spruce </i>them up.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.062
We want you
to create an original

02:26.146 --> 02:29.566
Christmas tree ornament collection
that will transform your tree.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.860
So that means each and every ornament

02:31.943 --> 02:35.780
has to be well made and
part of a cohesive design and theme.

02:35.864 --> 02:39.450
Topped off, of course,
with a spectacular Christmas tree topper,

02:39.534 --> 02:42.579
and it better be spectacular.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.832
-I'm sorry, what?
-Spectacular, spectacular!

02:47.333 --> 02:50.295
The winner of today's challenge
will not only be named "Best in Blow"

02:50.378 --> 02:52.797
but will have a guaranteed spot
in the finale.

02:52.881 --> 02:56.301
But the artist that does not
blow us away will be eliminated.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.344
That's a lot of pressure, but don't worry.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.180
We're not here to Scrooge you.

03:00.263 --> 03:05.018
Today we're giving you two assistants each
and five hours to complete the challenge.

03:05.101 --> 03:05.935
Thank God.

03:06.019 --> 03:09.439
Bobby and I are going to be looking
for both quantity and quality.

03:10.064 --> 03:12.942
Your finished work
will be judged on design,

03:13.026 --> 03:16.738
concept, technical skill,
and overall presentation.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.239
Oh Christmas Tree.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.284
All right, guys, on your marks, get set,

03:21.826 --> 03:23.077
blow us away!

03:29.792 --> 03:32.629
There are so many different kinds
of ornaments out there.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.006
It's hard to think about something new.

03:35.089 --> 03:38.676
I'm thinking to create a word search tree.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.846
Each ornament is, like, one letter,
and I will just hang it.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.099
First word you see is what you get
next year, or something like that.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.726
I'll only choose a positive word

03:46.809 --> 03:49.187
so everybody can get
positive year next year.

03:49.270 --> 03:54.609
My tree topper is a mouth, to imply
that this is the words from the universe.

03:56.986 --> 04:00.823
So, I want to make this tree with
all these different variations on ice,

04:00.907 --> 04:03.076
ice as it moves into vapor.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.703
So I'm gonna have these big ice cubes.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.790
I'm gonna have baubles
that look like they're frozen over,

04:08.873 --> 04:13.336
and as stuff gets taller,
it's going to get lighter and more vapory.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.712
No color.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.715
I want to dazzle and captivate

04:17.799 --> 04:20.718
with all of these different
treatments of clear glass.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.845
We'll see how that goes.

04:25.014 --> 04:27.016
I'm not classic, per se,

04:27.100 --> 04:31.938
but one of the things I love
about glass and Christmas is traditions.

04:32.522 --> 04:37.610
It's supposedly, like, a German tradition
to hide a Christmas pickle Christmas Eve,

04:37.694 --> 04:41.489
and the first person to find it
ended up with an extra present.

04:41.572 --> 04:46.035
So I'm making everything in pickle color
so that it's harder to find the pickle.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.954
Perfect. I love it.

04:48.037 --> 04:52.333


04:55.545 --> 04:57.588
It's go time. Dun dun dun dun!

04:57.672 --> 04:58.673
Behind you, Alex.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.847
All right.
Everything kind of hinges on this one.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.099
It's the only way that I can stay here

05:08.182 --> 05:11.102
and not go back home
with my tail between my legs.

05:11.936 --> 05:14.272
Once we set up
and it's, like, production time,

05:14.897 --> 05:17.275
it's just gonna be balls to the wall.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.402
Yeah, if I could win this,

05:19.485 --> 05:23.406
you know, that means I can get
to the final two, so that means a lot.

05:23.906 --> 05:27.452
There seems to be a real buzz.
I think, much larger buzz than normal.

05:27.535 --> 05:31.873
There's a lot of hustle there.
It's kind of like production glassblowing.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.207
Production glassblowing?

05:33.291 --> 05:36.544
When you're making
the same thing over and over all day.

05:36.627 --> 05:37.503
Perfect.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.173
I haven't worked production
in a long time.

05:40.256 --> 05:42.633
Not my favorite job.

05:43.217 --> 05:46.429
We're getting in the groove.
You getting in the groove, Cat?

05:46.512 --> 05:49.223
Groove? Baby,
I've always had the groove.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.141
Ha!

05:58.941 --> 06:03.696
So, I counted earlier,
and there are 168 hooks in each tree.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.991
Do you think they can pull off
168 pieces?

06:07.617 --> 06:10.036
Five hours with two assistants?

06:10.119 --> 06:11.621
-Really?
-Might get close.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.456
-Really?
-Yeah.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.917
It would depend on
how elaborate they're going,

06:16.000 --> 06:17.668
but they could get in the ballpark.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.212
I will be impressed.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.384
Hope there's enough glass
for everyone today.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.681
I am writing a letter on the color

06:30.765 --> 06:34.727
so that we can have colorful words
on the Christmas tree.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.355
I hope the color will turn out okay.

06:37.855 --> 06:41.984
When I make ornaments,
I can make about 15 an hour,

06:42.068 --> 06:43.653
so we got five hours.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.239
So that's only 75 ornaments.

06:46.322 --> 06:49.033
How I'm gonna do this, I don't know!

06:49.117 --> 06:51.077
That's why I'm running.

06:52.745 --> 06:56.082
We're just making ornaments,
a million freaking ornaments.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.292
This is my wheelhouse.

06:58.376 --> 07:03.005
I work four days a week
doing production glassblowing.

07:03.089 --> 07:07.427
I like it. You kind of get, like,
in this meditative state of just doing.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.475
Physically, your body
just becomes a machine.

07:15.143 --> 07:20.106
For me, the only time my mind kind of,
like, quiets into a singular experience

07:20.189 --> 07:24.694
is when I'm so overwhelmed
by this, like, seeming chaos of the shop.

07:28.364 --> 07:29.449
Awesome!

07:35.288 --> 07:37.999
Oh, look at that. Look at that!

07:42.420 --> 07:44.922
I see Alex is dipping
his ornament in the water.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.925
I assume it's to cool,
but is there another reason why?

07:48.009 --> 07:49.844
It's a decorative technique

07:49.927 --> 07:53.097
that cracks the surface of the glass
and makes it look like ice.

07:55.057 --> 07:58.644
And it has to still be
a little bit molten when I drop it,

07:59.103 --> 08:02.148
and I have to spend enough time
in the water to get the cracking,

08:02.231 --> 08:04.609
but not too much
so that cracks all the way through.

08:05.568 --> 08:09.322
That fragmentation,
it has to only happen on the outside,

08:09.405 --> 08:13.034
but not permeate all the way through,
because then I just have cracked glass.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.412
That might be too much cracking.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.539
Yeah, okay, that one's gone.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.128
Hey, guys,
we got two hours and 20 minutes!

08:24.212 --> 08:25.421
Oh boy.

08:27.798 --> 08:31.427
So, Bobby, what are you
gonna be looking for, design-wise?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.596
I want to see a story.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.390
I don't just want to see
a bunch of random pretty pieces.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.602
I want them to all mean something
and I want it to all flow together.

08:39.685 --> 08:42.396
-You?
-Probably the same, honestly.

08:42.480 --> 08:46.484
That's what's gonna make the difference,
is how well everything sings together.

08:47.693 --> 08:48.778
Nice.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.032
I'm just making Christmas baubles.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.160
Super traditional Renaissance glass.

08:58.246 --> 09:02.083
These molds are
about as old as glassblowing.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.002
Every glassblower uses optic molds.

09:05.628 --> 09:10.424
It looks a bit like an orange juicer
that has these triangular ridges in it,

09:10.508 --> 09:14.136
so when it comes out,
you can actually hear it go…

09:14.762 --> 09:17.223
Doesn't get any more
traditional than this.

09:17.306 --> 09:18.808


09:18.891 --> 09:20.851
All right, "party,"
my favorite word.

09:23.104 --> 09:28.276
I haven't won anything yet, so it's time
for me to win, right?

09:30.027 --> 09:32.321
Cat and Alexander
have very different energy.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.741
Both are very different artists,

09:35.825 --> 09:38.536
so it's very hard for me,
who I want to go to finale with.

09:38.619 --> 09:41.497
Wait. Yeah, "joy." Right? "J."

09:43.958 --> 09:45.376
Straight up and down.

09:46.335 --> 09:49.213
I am making part of the topper.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.299
I did not finish making all my ornaments.

09:51.382 --> 09:54.135
I just know this is going to take
a little bit of focus.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.511
I can't rush this one.

09:56.804 --> 10:00.850
I've made a few spectacular
Christmas tree toppers before.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.853
Never for Katherine Gray
and Bobby Berk, though.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.732
I know you are
a big fan of minimal design.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.401
Does that hold true
with Christmas decorations as well?

10:10.484 --> 10:12.236
Oh. Even more so.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.573
Christmas decorations, to me,
I'm honestly not usually a fan of

10:15.656 --> 10:18.409
because it just adds
more stuff to my home I don't like,

10:18.492 --> 10:22.163
so if I am gonna do Christmas ornaments,
I want them to be very simple.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.999
-But it needs to be perfect.
-Mm-hm.

10:25.666 --> 10:29.128
I'm gonna make these big bubbles

10:29.211 --> 10:32.632
that will fit over
the little points on the end there.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.301
It's hard when you work
with thin bits

10:35.384 --> 10:37.553
that extend off of the body of the glass,

10:37.637 --> 10:40.931
because they get cold really fast
and they get hot really fast,

10:41.015 --> 10:43.351
and they get cold and hot
at different rates.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.394
If I make a mistake,

10:46.354 --> 10:48.272
stuff's gonna break.

10:48.356 --> 10:53.235


10:53.319 --> 10:55.988
Guys, 58 minutes left!

11:15.174 --> 11:16.175
Whoo!

11:17.468 --> 11:18.636
Oh boy.

11:21.430 --> 11:22.515
Bye.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.727
It broke off exactly where I wanted it to…

11:26.811 --> 11:29.355
…just not at the time that I wanted it to.

11:31.899 --> 11:35.653
So, I just gotta, like,
compose myself, go gather again,

11:35.736 --> 11:36.987
and make the next one.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.865


11:45.621 --> 11:47.039
-Cat.
-Hi, Miss Kathy.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.833
How's this all coming?

11:48.916 --> 11:53.254
I've never really gotten a chance to do
anything, kind of, classic glass here,

11:53.337 --> 11:58.968
so I'm going super, like,
Victorian classic designs.

11:59.677 --> 12:03.389
Every single challenge,
I feel like I'm becoming

12:03.472 --> 12:05.015
a better artist,

12:05.099 --> 12:08.102
but Alexander and Nao
are pushing themselves

12:08.185 --> 12:10.938
as hard as they possibly can
to get to the finale.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.858
Usually I freaking love
decorating the tree,

12:13.941 --> 12:18.404
but, like, competition and having to make
5,000 of them's taking it out of it a bit.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.740
I'll let you carry on.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.199
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.119
Looks good.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.956
Cut it. Perfect.

12:31.876 --> 12:36.005
Glass is beautiful,
but it requires a lot of respect.

12:36.881 --> 12:40.259
This process
of creating art in glass

12:40.342 --> 12:42.011
takes all my attention and focus.

12:42.094 --> 12:46.223
That makes me realize
that I am just a tiny being.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.267
That makes me very humble.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.937
Look at this "E." It's perfect. So cute.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.275
-Hi there, Alexander.
-Hey.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.526
How's it going?

12:58.152 --> 13:00.529
Wish glassblowing was easier.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.365
So, you're pretty close
to being in the final.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.034
-How's that feel?

13:05.117 --> 13:07.411
-I've been here before.
-Yeah.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.372
You know, I didn't make it
into the finals on season one,

13:10.456 --> 13:12.833
and I'm haunted by that.

13:12.917 --> 13:17.046
I feel like I have "Season One,
Third Place" stamped on my forehead,

13:17.129 --> 13:20.966
and I'd love to replace it
with "First Place" this season.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.344
What would it mean
to make it to the finale?

13:23.427 --> 13:25.304
It'd be cool to have that validation that

13:25.387 --> 13:28.849
the stuff I do
fits in this particular mode,

13:28.933 --> 13:33.562
and it would be really great to be able
to contribute to the charity that I chose.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.940
Yeah, and plus you get some money too.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.776
Money, for me, is always great.
It's good to get paid.

13:39.735 --> 13:44.031
After being on <i>Blown Away</i>
for the first time, my life changed.

13:44.114 --> 13:47.117
I was able to make money
selling glass for the first time,

13:47.952 --> 13:48.953
and it was great.

13:49.036 --> 13:53.374
This is the one where you accidentally
burn your hand if you're not careful.

13:55.876 --> 13:59.004
I'm gonna make a pickle.

13:59.088 --> 14:03.175
It's kind of like
an amorphous, lumpy blob.

14:03.259 --> 14:07.012
I don't know if you've heard,
but I'm kind of a "big dill."

14:09.181 --> 14:10.349
Yeah, pickle.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.270
Pickle time!<i> Doo doo doo doo doo!</i>

14:15.229 --> 14:16.814
Almost done, okay, guys?

14:17.815 --> 14:20.568
I think we made
at least 100 ornaments so far.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.653
Assistants are working very hard here.

14:23.612 --> 14:26.448
-Good catch.
-Good. Nice catch. Fabulous.

14:29.159 --> 14:31.912
I am remaking the topper.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.375
I want it to look like it's about to
float away, like a cloud or something.

14:37.960 --> 14:42.006
The way to get that is
to blow this glass out paper-thin,

14:42.089 --> 14:44.967
like so thin that it cools instantly.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.844
Break it off carefully into a glove,

14:46.927 --> 14:48.971
and just lay it on the floor
and let it cool.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.931
-There it is.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.350
See if you can carefully set that down.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.186
Yeah, just real gently on there.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.104
That's it.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.066
I love Alexander's tree topper.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.152
I just want to have it in my house.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.240
This is perfect, guys.
All right, let's get that wrap.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.953
Bloop bloop bloop bloop…

15:13.037 --> 15:18.125
I'm getting what's called a wrap
put on my Christmas tree topper.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.921
We stick the tip on,
and then it pulls from the back,

15:22.004 --> 15:23.756
and it wraps around the whole thing,

15:23.839 --> 15:27.384
and I'm going to use that
to hold all of the cane

15:27.468 --> 15:30.846
that we've pulled
to make all of my sun rays.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.392
Gold! I love it!

15:35.476 --> 15:41.190


15:41.273 --> 15:42.650
Thirty-minute warning!

15:42.733 --> 15:44.443
Thirty-minute warning!

15:44.944 --> 15:46.236
Well, that's not helpful.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.113
And a flip.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.951
I'm making a tree topper now,
which is the shape of the mouth.

15:52.034 --> 15:55.496
I don't even know,
like, if I'm doing it right.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.338
Trying to make ambitious stuff
in a short amount of time.

16:04.421 --> 16:06.674
It's always, kind of,
racing against the clock.

16:08.008 --> 16:10.260
The thing I'm most worried about

16:10.344 --> 16:12.638
is not covering the tree.

16:13.555 --> 16:14.640
There you go.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.850
-All right.

16:17.434 --> 16:18.477
It looks amazing.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.940
So this is more about
that overall presentation.

16:23.023 --> 16:26.026
That's something I really like to do,
like, installation stuff,

16:26.110 --> 16:29.279
so, yeah, it would
mean a lot if I could win this.

16:29.363 --> 16:32.491
I believe in myself,
and I believe in my art.

16:32.574 --> 16:36.537
I love what I create,
so there's nothing to worry about.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.582
All right, everybody, ten minutes left,

16:40.666 --> 16:43.919
and I want to see
both quantity and quality.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.754
-Whoo!

16:45.838 --> 16:47.006
It is what it is.

16:47.589 --> 16:49.633
Get one more banged out in five minutes.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.343
All right, can I get two more?

16:58.684 --> 16:59.977
Last word.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.061
Let's go.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.439
All right, Lydia,
be ready with a hook in a sec.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.109
All right, glassblowers,
it's countdown time.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.987
Three minutes left.
Get everything in the annealers.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.405
Bah, humbug!

17:12.197 --> 17:13.282
Nice.

17:14.491 --> 17:17.161
Yeah. Good job!

17:17.953 --> 17:20.039
-Whoo!

17:20.122 --> 17:21.498
-Thank you.
-Awesome.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.833
Oh my God, so cute!

17:22.916 --> 17:25.586
-They're pretty.
-Like Christmas.

17:39.266 --> 17:44.229
For this challenge, we had to make
as many ornaments as possible

17:44.313 --> 17:47.232
to fill this entire Christmas tree.

17:48.192 --> 17:51.528
I hope the evaluators
see my ornament collection

17:51.612 --> 17:55.324
and appreciate that
I'm also capable of design.

17:55.407 --> 17:59.328
I want to show them
another facet to me as an artist.

18:00.704 --> 18:03.207
I want to captivate the evaluators

18:03.290 --> 18:06.376
with all of these different
treatments of clear glass,

18:06.460 --> 18:11.840
and I want them to be drawn in by
my super-light clouds floating at the top.

18:14.968 --> 18:18.388
I think this tree will represent
how positive I am, and also

18:18.472 --> 18:21.558
how much I believe
in those positive affirmations,

18:21.642 --> 18:25.395
and I hope the evaluator
can feel my energy.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.985
All right, Katherine, gallery time.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.446
So this is Cat's tree.

18:34.530 --> 18:38.617
"Cat's tree was inspired by vintage glass
and the rich history of ornaments,

18:38.700 --> 18:40.285
like pickle tradition."

18:40.369 --> 18:42.746
"Parents hide a pickle ornament
on Christmas Eve,

18:42.830 --> 18:45.332
and whoever finds it
gets an extra present from Santa."

18:46.083 --> 18:49.419
-I think I spy it over here, so…
-Oh, oh.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.421
…I get the extra present.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.090
I think the topper is beautiful.

18:53.173 --> 18:56.009
-It is.
-Probably my favorite piece on the tree.

18:56.093 --> 18:59.221
I would agree. I mean, I like
the type of ornaments that she's making.

18:59.304 --> 19:03.308
These take some time to make each one,
so I think that's a really nice touch.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.019
But I'm kind of wondering
if I love the palette.

19:06.103 --> 19:11.150
Yeah. It's very Renaissance with the golds
and ambers and greens and yellows,

19:11.233 --> 19:17.489
but I wish she'd been more spatially aware
with the sizing between each "branch,"

19:17.573 --> 19:20.117
because a lot of them hit the bottom.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.704
I like it when they're floating.
I think it really looks best.

19:24.371 --> 19:28.292
Yeah, I feel like the candy canes and
even these little icicle-looking things…

19:28.375 --> 19:30.711
-Look at this one. Yeah.
-…seem like filler.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.337
I don't think they add that much.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.923
The topper reminds me of the Virgin Mary.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.676
It does have that look
of that aura

19:37.759 --> 19:39.803
behind a lot of icon paintings and stuff.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.930
-Yeah, I think it's beautiful.
-Yeah.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.311
So this is Nao's tree.

19:48.687 --> 19:49.855
Nice.

19:49.938 --> 19:52.316
It says "joy"
up at the top there.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.151
I see" fabulous."

19:54.234 --> 19:57.070
I see "badass."

19:57.154 --> 20:00.574
I do like also that the topper
is a mouth, because it's speaking

20:00.657 --> 20:02.034
all of these words.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.703
You know, I think this is
kind of a really unique idea.

20:05.287 --> 20:08.874
I love the idea that
you can kind of find something in here,

20:08.957 --> 20:11.126
and I like that interactive quality.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.295
She filled this very evenly.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.381
None of them hit the branch below.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.467
Scale and density
is really nice.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.052
Yep. That I like.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.557
So this is Alexander's tree.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.936
The topper is amazing.

20:29.019 --> 20:31.647
It looks pretty thin.
It looks very delicate.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.650
I love the organic shape.
It does look like a cloud.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.361
I think it evokes
that sense of, like, water vapor.

20:37.861 --> 20:41.240
I wish there was that same kind of magic
in some of these other things.

20:41.323 --> 20:45.744
You know what, honestly,
a lot of where I see a fail

20:45.827 --> 20:47.454
is just a display issue.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.539
I think he should've
spread stuff out more,

20:49.623 --> 20:51.583
because he's got
a whole area at the bottom

20:52.417 --> 20:53.961
where he doesn't have any.

20:54.044 --> 20:56.505
You've learned by now
I love minimalist design,

20:56.588 --> 20:58.131
so I'm a fan of the all clear.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.217
I like that
it's just simple, clean, clear.

21:01.176 --> 21:05.931
I think these ornaments might
look better on a green tree than here.

21:06.014 --> 21:09.643
From here up, I'm with it, I love it.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.271
But from here down, you start to lose me.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.776
-I see three very different trees

21:17.859 --> 21:19.945
and three very different competitors here.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.989
It's gonna be hard to choose this round.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.324
-Shall we go grill the glassblowers?
-Let's.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.873
I'm feeling really confident
about my wins, but I'm also, like,

21:31.957 --> 21:35.836
is this just pushing me up a mountain
so I can fall off the ledge?

21:35.919 --> 21:40.257
I'm feeling nervous and excitement,
little bit of both.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.175
No, a lot of both.

21:42.259 --> 21:45.304
I haven't won any
of the other challenges,

21:45.387 --> 21:48.432
but this is the one
that I need to get into the finals.

21:48.932 --> 21:53.186
You had five hours to create a unique
glass Christmas ornament collection.

21:53.270 --> 21:56.773
That kind of challenge, I'm sure, can
sound kind of generic for a glassblower,

21:56.857 --> 21:59.860
but I think you showed us
the uniqueness and individuality

21:59.943 --> 22:02.529
that you can bring
to that kind of assignment.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.365
Nao, share with us
the inspiration behind your tree.

22:05.449 --> 22:09.494
So, I decided to make
a word search Christmas tree,

22:09.578 --> 22:13.623
so that people can play, like, a game
to kind of spark the conversation.

22:13.707 --> 22:14.791
Or a drinking game.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.627
-Why those particular colors?

22:17.711 --> 22:20.172
None of them seem
particularly Christmas-y.

22:20.255 --> 22:24.718
I mainly focused on creating
something that is more conceptual

22:24.801 --> 22:27.637
rather than care about
that looks of Christmas.

22:27.721 --> 22:30.349
I love when people don't do
traditional colors, per se.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.226
Everyone thinks, "It's Christmas.
Gotta be red and green."

22:33.310 --> 22:36.188
But it doesn't have to.
I like that you went outside of the box.

22:36.271 --> 22:38.857
That being said, I don't love the colors.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.776
I feel they look a little more Easter-y.

22:40.859 --> 22:44.988
It took me to a different holiday,
which is what you have to be careful with.

22:45.072 --> 22:45.906
I see.

22:45.989 --> 22:48.492
But I do love
that it tells a story.

22:48.575 --> 22:49.618
I instantly got it.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.037
I was like,
"The mouth, it's saying all the words!"

22:52.120 --> 22:55.332
So it helped me get over the fact
that it felt a little Easter-y to me.

22:55.415 --> 22:59.169
So, Nao, do you think this tree is
good enough to get you into the finale?

22:59.252 --> 23:00.170
I'm proud of myself.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.422
-Thanks very much, Nao.
-Thank you.

23:02.506 --> 23:05.634
-Alexander, Mr. Clear Christmas.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.386
-Tell us about your tree.

23:07.469 --> 23:11.139
So I was just thinking
about different states of water

23:11.223 --> 23:14.101
and how, like, in these cold places,
ice never really melts.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.853
It just, kind of,
eventually turns into vapor.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.356
Trying to capture that
in a glass Christmas ornament,

23:19.439 --> 23:20.899
I think, is pretty ambitious.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.068
Thank you.

23:23.151 --> 23:24.945
So the topper I love.

23:25.028 --> 23:27.906
To me, I walked in and was like,
Zaha Hadid space station.

23:27.989 --> 23:30.826
-Like it's floating up in space.

23:30.909 --> 23:31.868
It was beautiful.

23:31.952 --> 23:34.287
The first two rows, beautiful.

23:34.371 --> 23:37.624
But as I went down further,
I didn't like as much.

23:37.707 --> 23:41.711
I personally feel that if you'd went with
a lot of the ones that you did up top,

23:41.795 --> 23:44.381
the different molecules,
made them unique like snowflakes,

23:44.464 --> 23:46.425
it would have had
a really big visual impact

23:46.508 --> 23:48.760
instead of trying to do
so many different things.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.929
I hear you.

23:51.012 --> 23:53.348
Do you think your tree
reflects your skills

23:53.432 --> 23:55.392
and is good enough to get into the finale?

23:55.475 --> 23:57.477
Aw, man, it's tough.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.479
This is when I went home the last time,

23:59.563 --> 24:01.440
so it would feel great

24:01.523 --> 24:04.651
to, I guess, just, like,
see some progress…

24:04.734 --> 24:05.735
…in that respect.

24:05.819 --> 24:08.280
It would be huge for me
to be able to get that.

24:08.363 --> 24:09.656
Thank you, Alexander.

24:09.739 --> 24:10.657
Thanks.

24:11.700 --> 24:15.328
So, Cat, what was your motivation
when designing your tree?

24:15.412 --> 24:17.747
For me, what I love about Christmas

24:17.831 --> 24:21.585
and what I love about glass is tradition.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.545
We thought your topper was amazing.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.422
You know, really kind of a showstopper.

24:25.505 --> 24:30.886
The tree topper is based off of
my grandparents' super-vintage one

24:30.969 --> 24:33.597
that everyone fights over
who's gonna get it when they die.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.099
-It's the--
-Lovely holiday conversation.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.934
-Right? Yeah.

24:39.102 --> 24:42.522
One thing I noticed
was there's a lot of different styles

24:42.606 --> 24:44.107
and different colors of ornaments.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.942
It seems like maybe there's too many,

24:46.026 --> 24:48.737
that it starts to lose
a bit of cohesion because of that.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.989
You could've done without
the candy canes.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.365
That'd have been perfect.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.575
Mm-hm.

24:53.658 --> 24:54.701
Thanks very much, Cat.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.536
-Thank you.
-Thank you, artists.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.663
Sending one of you home
is not gonna be easy,

24:58.747 --> 25:00.665
but alas, that's the name of the game.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.002
Please give us a few minutes
to make our final decision.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.547
For this,
because it is my wheelhouse,

25:07.631 --> 25:10.717
if I get eliminated
on this specific challenge,

25:10.800 --> 25:12.594
I'll be three times as mad.

25:13.178 --> 25:16.431
I had high expectations,
and they weren't really met.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.351
I feel like they all could've done better.

25:19.893 --> 25:24.314
I'm here to push myself,
and if I could be a <i>Blown Away</i> champion,

25:24.397 --> 25:28.443
that means confirmation with the universe
that we are on the same page.

25:28.985 --> 25:30.737
I loved that topper.

25:30.820 --> 25:31.863
Mm-hm.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.323
-Okay.
-Yep.

25:33.406 --> 25:35.867
I'd love it even better
if it was enough to win,

25:35.951 --> 25:38.161
but I hope it's enough to not go home.

25:41.122 --> 25:42.791
Glassblowers, thank you for waiting.

25:42.874 --> 25:45.919
For one of you standing here today,
Christmas has come early.

25:46.002 --> 25:49.422
Today's "Best in Blow" goes to…

25:51.800 --> 25:53.510
-Nao.

25:53.593 --> 25:55.345
-Yes! Yes!
-Congratulations.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.932
It's a Christmas miracle!

25:59.015 --> 26:00.225
Thank you so much.

26:00.308 --> 26:01.851
I'm going to finale.

26:01.935 --> 26:06.106
I am so proud of myself
and very relieved at the same time.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.608
I'll try my best
to not disappoint you guys.

26:11.319 --> 26:13.530
And the artist
that did not blow us away

26:13.613 --> 26:16.157
and must sadly leave the hot shop is…

26:22.080 --> 26:23.039
I'm sorry, Alexander.

26:25.625 --> 26:26.793
Dude!

26:26.876 --> 26:29.796
Please take your stocking from the mantel
and exit the hot shop.

26:29.879 --> 26:31.256
You blew me away, bud.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.551
Thank you. Thanks, guys.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.053
I just love this material.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.638
I love this process.

26:39.347 --> 26:42.976
I hope that I'm able to do it
in some capacity for the rest of my life.

26:43.059 --> 26:46.021
-Really love what you do.
-Thanks. Nice to see you.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.027
I'm thrilled that Cat and Nao
made it to the last one.

26:52.110 --> 26:55.488
I think it's going to be
a really good final challenge.

26:57.198 --> 26:58.491
Happy holidays.

27:00.952 --> 27:05.248
Cat, Nao, it's time to get some rest,
because believe me, you're gonna need it.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.417
We'll see you back here
for the finale, okay?

27:08.001 --> 27:10.003
-Two girls.
-Two girls.
