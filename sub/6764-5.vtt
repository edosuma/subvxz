01:40.667 --> 01:42.658
Good morning.

01:43.069 --> 01:45.094
I can't believe this.
It's my first day of classes,

01:45.271 --> 01:47.068
and I look like
I already need a vacation.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.502
No, you look great.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.974
All you need is some caffeine.
It will get you going.

01:54.981 --> 01:57.279
I need to work on my recipe?

01:57.851 --> 02:00.411
No, no, it's great. Thanks.

02:02.322 --> 02:05.291
So, what time did you get home
last night?

02:05.458 --> 02:08.484
Oh, I think you mean morning.
Six-fifteen.

02:08.661 --> 02:10.322
Really?
I'm surprised I didn't hear you.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.021
I woke up at 6:00,
and I was so excited

02:12.198 --> 02:14.598
I couldn't get back to sleep,
so I just hopped in the shower.

02:14.767 --> 02:17.861
I'm so excited.
It's our first day of college.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.704
- What time is it?
- Eight-thirty.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.672
Here, I gotta go wake up David.

02:24.110 --> 02:26.635
While you're at it, tell him
to clean up his mess in the kitchen.

02:26.813 --> 02:30.544
David, come on, wake up.
We gotta get going.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.275
David.

02:32.452 --> 02:34.249
Just two more minutes.

02:34.420 --> 02:38.550
Come on, you don't wanna be late
for your first day of classes, do you?

02:39.859 --> 02:41.019
David, come on.

02:41.194 --> 02:45.756
Donna, I'm a big boy, okay?
Don't worry, I'll get there.

03:59.038 --> 04:01.097
Isn't that Dan Rubin?

04:13.152 --> 04:14.551
How's it going?

04:14.721 --> 04:16.279
Fine.

04:17.223 --> 04:18.850
So, what's the hot story?

04:19.024 --> 04:22.586
Let me guess,
panty raid at the Alpha House.

04:23.196 --> 04:25.596
Classifieds, actually.
I'm looking for a job.

04:25.965 --> 04:28.627
Really? I thought Brandon was
the only working stiff in your family.

04:28.801 --> 04:30.462
Not anymore.
Just because I'm in school,

04:30.637 --> 04:32.662
doesn't mean
I can't get a head start on real life.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.535
Never too early
to start building that empire.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.409
Right.

04:38.311 --> 04:40.142
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

04:40.313 --> 04:43.976
And welcome to Romantic Poetry.

04:44.150 --> 04:46.983
My name is Dr. Pettey,

04:47.153 --> 04:52.523
and I will be your intrepid guide
through this rich and vibrant world

04:52.692 --> 04:55.889
of meter, measure and meaning.

04:56.329 --> 05:01.198
Poetry, like life, is based on...

05:03.069 --> 05:06.266
Rhythm. The heartbeat.

05:06.439 --> 05:08.339
The pulse rate.

05:08.508 --> 05:12.000
All based on rhythm.

05:12.512 --> 05:16.778
In poetry,
we have iambic pentameter,

05:16.949 --> 05:19.941
trochaic tetrameter,

05:20.119 --> 05:22.952
dactylic hexameter,

05:23.122 --> 05:27.456
and on and on and on.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.959
Here we go, Bren.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.860
Bran, I can't believe this assignment.
How do they expect us to do this work?

05:37.036 --> 05:39.800
Steve, it's two chapters, it's 45 pages.
It's no big deal.

05:39.972 --> 05:43.840
You're missing the point. We're not
here to just study theory and data.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.979
We're here to develop our social skills,
learn to interact with the larger...

05:47.146 --> 05:49.546
Yeah, you interact. I gotta go
to the library and get started.

05:49.716 --> 05:51.206
- Do you wanna come with me?
- I can't.

05:51.384 --> 05:52.681
I got a meeting at the KEG House.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.252
- Planning a freshman pool party.
- That's a party every week.

05:55.421 --> 05:56.445
How are you gonna keep up?

05:56.622 --> 05:58.351
It's a tough life,
but someone's gotta do it.

05:58.524 --> 05:59.889
- Hey, Bren.
- Bren, how's it going?

06:00.059 --> 06:02.425
- Hey, it's going.
- Any luck here on the job board?

06:02.595 --> 06:04.222
Actually,
I'm heading over to Maxwell's.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.764
Celeste said there's an opening there,
so it's my best lead.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.162
Actually, it's my only lead.

06:09.569 --> 06:10.763
- Well, good luck.
- Thanks.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.495
- Bye, Bren.
- Bye.

06:13.005 --> 06:15.803
Brandon, I don't think it's a good
idea that Brenda works at Maxwell's.

06:15.975 --> 06:17.772
I thought Celeste
liked working there.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.412
She does, but the thing is...

06:21.114 --> 06:22.274
I'm gonna break up with her.

06:22.448 --> 06:23.813
Why would you break up
with Celeste?

06:23.983 --> 06:26.417
Gorgeous girl, a great chick.
You had a great summer together.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.816
- What's the problem?
- I know, but...

06:28.988 --> 06:32.048
Look around, Brandon, I don't think
this is the time for us to be tied down.

06:32.492 --> 06:35.120
- When are you gonna lay this on her?
- I'm gonna tell her tonight.

06:35.294 --> 06:36.989
She have any idea it's coming?

06:37.530 --> 06:38.724
Probably not.

06:40.466 --> 06:41.797
Well, go easy on her, man.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.629
Hey, I'm a sensitive guy.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.368
What's that?

06:53.880 --> 06:56.348
They're 100 percent cotton,
and the shipment came in last week.

06:56.516 --> 06:57.676
That's great.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.943
Why don't you pick one out
in your size and try it on?

07:00.119 --> 07:01.677
I'll be right back.

07:04.056 --> 07:05.216
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.154
How did it go?
Trey's really nice, isn't he?

07:07.326 --> 07:09.988
- Yeah, he's a great guy.
- What happened?

07:10.163 --> 07:11.892
Nothing. I mean, I think he liked me.

07:12.064 --> 07:14.726
But it's just the interview ended
and he put my application

07:14.901 --> 07:16.664
on a pile with all the others.

07:16.836 --> 07:18.804
There's a ton of people
who want this job.

07:18.971 --> 07:20.598
Don't worry,
I'll put a good word for you.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.900
- Thanks, I appreciate your help.
- Okay.

07:23.075 --> 07:26.044
I should get back to my customer,
but I'll let you know if I hear anything.

07:26.212 --> 07:28.737
Okay, so I'll see you
at the pool party tomorrow, right?

07:28.915 --> 07:31.713
- Pool party?
- Yeah, on campus, for the freshmen.

07:32.351 --> 07:34.979
- Didn't Steve tell you?
- No.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.213
Well, I'm sure
it just slipped his mind.

07:38.257 --> 07:39.884
Yeah.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.054
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.335
Where's the barbecue sauce?

07:50.503 --> 07:52.232
I forgot to bring it out.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.236
I'll get it.

07:54.407 --> 07:57.342
Can you tell him
to turn that down, please?

07:59.545 --> 08:01.035
Donna, what do you think
about a segue

08:01.214 --> 08:03.546
from Front 242 to Porno for Pyros?

08:03.716 --> 08:05.240
Great.

08:05.418 --> 08:08.216
Oh, wait, I want you
to hear something. Hold on.

08:15.528 --> 08:18.019
Hold on. So, what do you think?

08:18.197 --> 08:19.528
Whatever you want.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.826
Donna, we're supposed
to be doing this together.

08:24.003 --> 08:27.336
How come you never help me
with any of our playlists?

08:31.210 --> 08:34.611
David, I'm sorry.
I just can't take it anymore.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.681
I'm not a night person.
And lately, I'm not a day person either.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.181
The show is driving me crazy.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.946
It'll get better, you'll see.
We just have to prove ourselves.

08:43.121 --> 08:44.145
I can't.

08:44.323 --> 08:46.757
Donna, as soon as Howard sees
that he can count on us,

08:46.926 --> 08:48.052
he'll give us a day shift.

08:48.227 --> 08:50.889
Look, David,
maybe things come easier for you.

08:51.063 --> 08:53.327
But with all this reading,
I'm gonna fall behind.

08:53.499 --> 08:55.160
Well, can you just hang in there?

08:55.334 --> 08:57.199
I don't know.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.600
So, what do you wanna do?

09:02.875 --> 09:05.309
I'm gonna go see Howard tomorrow.

09:05.811 --> 09:07.073
And I'm gonna quit.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.277
Donna, he hired us as a team.

09:10.149 --> 09:11.275
I'm sorry, David.

09:11.450 --> 09:14.180
So, what are you saying?
You can't hack it, so the hell with me?

09:14.353 --> 09:16.685
- No.
- Well, that's what it sounds like.

09:16.856 --> 09:17.948
That's not what I'm doing.

09:18.991 --> 09:20.458
Whatever.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.593
David, don't be angry.

09:23.896 --> 09:28.299
Look, I'll do the show with you tonight,
but that's the last one.

09:28.868 --> 09:31.302
Listen, don't do me any favors,
okay?

09:40.947 --> 09:42.380
Kelly?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.377
John.

09:46.786 --> 09:49.186
- How did you know where I live?
- I'm a psychic.

09:52.124 --> 09:54.422
I hope you don't mind.
I followed you home.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.021
You followed me?

09:57.196 --> 09:59.790
It's the only way I could figure out
how to find you.

09:59.966 --> 10:01.558
I wanted to give you these.

10:04.303 --> 10:06.362
They're beautiful.

10:07.907 --> 10:09.534
Thank you.

10:09.709 --> 10:12.303
But I thought I told you at the party
I already have a boyfriend.

10:12.845 --> 10:14.676
Yeah, Dylan.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.109
See what a good memory I have?

10:16.282 --> 10:17.749
Very impressive.

10:18.584 --> 10:20.313
Look, Kelly, I want you to know

10:20.486 --> 10:23.478
that I respect the fact
that you're in a relationship.

10:24.890 --> 10:25.914
Good.

10:26.092 --> 10:28.856
But I also want you to know
that I don't give up easily.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.689
Especially when it's worth it.

10:35.835 --> 10:41.068
So I hope this has cleared up
any misunderstandings that we've had.

10:41.540 --> 10:43.565
I'll see you girls later.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.570
Beautiful flowers.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.276
Yeah, they are.

11:02.028 --> 11:05.191
You know, it's funny
when I think about how we first met.

11:05.364 --> 11:09.027
You and Brandon fighting over me
on some silly game show.

11:10.636 --> 11:13.571
I remember
how I really wanted that date.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.768
I just didn't give much thought
to settling down, though.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.041
It's funny how things turn out.

11:20.212 --> 11:22.203
I guess it really was love
at first sight.

11:26.585 --> 11:28.883
Sometimes I think...

11:30.056 --> 11:32.547
Well, sometimes I think
I'm not that type.

11:32.725 --> 11:37.389
You know, we don't have to go
to that movie if you don't want to.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.025
Were we gonna go to a movie?

11:39.999 --> 11:41.762
We can do anything you want.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.697
Anything?

11:52.078 --> 11:54.603
So I looked it up on the microfilm,
and there it was.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.338
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address,

11:56.515 --> 11:58.506
<i>right on the front page
of The New York Times.</i>

11:58.684 --> 12:00.618
You should have seen
what they wrote about him.

12:00.786 --> 12:02.720
You would have thought the guy
had held up traffic

12:02.888 --> 12:06.289
on the Cumberland Trail
just to get his beard trimmed.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.093
- Hey, Bren.
- Brenda.

12:11.263 --> 12:12.730
Dinner is almost ready.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.627
I am too tired to chew.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.598
- How did it go?
- Four jobs on the Westside.

12:17.770 --> 12:20.364
Either they were all taken
or they wanted somebody full-time,

12:20.539 --> 12:22.336
or they obviously
just hated me on sight.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.442
Don't be so hard on yourself.

12:24.610 --> 12:27.010
I even started getting depressed
about the jobs I didn't want.

12:27.179 --> 12:28.510
Well, what about Maxwell's?

12:28.681 --> 12:30.148
They offered me a charge account.

12:30.316 --> 12:31.977
Did you take it?

12:32.151 --> 12:35.245
Look, honey, don't worry.
You'll find something.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.218
You know what I really hate?

12:37.389 --> 12:39.357
It takes just as much work
to find a job,

12:39.525 --> 12:41.186
and you don't even get paid for it.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.128
Have you talked to Nat yet, Laverne?

12:44.296 --> 12:46.355
Come on,
I do not wanna be a singing waitress.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.729
- Well, what do you want?
- I don't know.

12:48.901 --> 12:51.233
I just keep on worrying
that we're gonna get finished

12:51.403 --> 12:55.567
with all this education and there's
still not gonna be any jobs left for us.

12:55.741 --> 12:57.709
I felt the same way
when I was in college.

12:57.877 --> 13:01.643
And hey, look at me.
You just have to have patience.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.844
Thanks, Dad.

13:06.552 --> 13:08.019
Brenda.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.589
How would you like to work for me?

13:12.658 --> 13:13.955
I want a real job.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.026
This is a real job.
We're short on office help.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.225
She'll work cheap.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.496
No, thanks.
I wanna do it on my own.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.206
Andrea,
this assignment is impossible.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.276
I cannot write my life story
in ten sentences.

13:32.444 --> 13:33.741
Well, you heard what Rubin wants.

13:33.913 --> 13:37.110
He just wants us to select a detail
that gives a sense of who we are.

13:37.316 --> 13:40.308
Great. I'll write ten sentences
on the bags under my eyes.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.614
Oh, I think he wants something
like a decision we've made

13:43.789 --> 13:47.782
or some important event in our life
that's helped to shape us.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.360
Like when all students stood up
for you so you could graduate.

13:50.529 --> 13:52.929
Now, that would be something great
to write about.

13:53.098 --> 13:55.931
Andrea, do you think I'm selfish?

13:56.502 --> 13:58.436
You, selfish?

13:58.604 --> 14:01.004
Please, you're one of the most
unselfish people I've ever met.

14:01.874 --> 14:04.172
I told David I was quitting
the radio show last night.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.410
I know. They hired us as a team

14:07.580 --> 14:09.707
and that's a really terrible thing
to do to him, right?

14:11.650 --> 14:13.083
Depends why you're quitting.

14:14.553 --> 14:17.317
Well, I'm just so tired
I'm walking into walls.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.821
And David's sleeping all the time.
He doesn't go to classes.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.653
Then he makes me feel
like I'm being a wimp

14:21.827 --> 14:23.852
for not being able
to keep up with him.

14:24.029 --> 14:28.557
Well, the one thing I learned
from my short stint

14:28.734 --> 14:30.361
on the campus paper

14:30.536 --> 14:33.061
was that these people really take
what they do seriously.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.676
So if you wanna make it,
you're gonna have to commit.

14:39.278 --> 14:42.145
I just don't know
if I want it that much.

14:42.314 --> 14:43.542
Not like David.

14:44.350 --> 14:45.578
That's what you have to go on.

14:48.087 --> 14:51.989
Hi. I'm going down to get a soda.
Can I bring you back anything?

14:52.157 --> 14:54.148
No, nothing for me, thanks.

14:54.326 --> 14:56.521
- Root beer, please.
- One root beer coming up.

14:58.764 --> 15:01.255
He is so cute.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.230
Donna, he's a teacher.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.836
Oh, excuse me,
like that's ever stopped you before?

15:06.605 --> 15:09.597
You went out with the drama teacher
and you were flirting with Mr. Myers.

15:09.775 --> 15:12.209
- I was not.
- And that was just in high school.

15:12.378 --> 15:13.868
That was ancient history.

15:15.381 --> 15:18.111
Face it, Andrea, you like older men.

15:24.623 --> 15:25.647
Look who's here.

15:25.824 --> 15:27.792
The most beautiful girl
in the freshman class.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.520
- Hello, John.
- Hello, dear, what's happening?

15:30.696 --> 15:32.926
I'm just waiting for my boyfriend.

15:33.699 --> 15:36.827
Well, if you were my girlfriend, I
wouldn't keep you waiting for anything.

15:37.002 --> 15:38.299
No, I bet you wouldn't.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.597
So am I gonna see you later
at the freshman pool party?

15:41.206 --> 15:42.639
Since when are you a freshman?

15:43.342 --> 15:46.539
You know, I don't think they're gonna
be checking for IDs at this thing, Kelly.

15:46.712 --> 15:47.906
I think so.

15:50.849 --> 15:52.908
Here comes Dylan.

15:54.053 --> 15:57.352
I'm only leaving so I don't have
to share you with anyone.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.351
Bye.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.685
- Kelly, it's unbelievable.
- What?

16:03.862 --> 16:05.796
Do you have any idea
who's on campus today?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.262
- Who?
- Emil Brewster.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.196
- Who?
- Emil Brewster.

16:09.368 --> 16:12.064
The guy who wrote the biography
of Kerouac that I've been reading.

16:12.237 --> 16:13.829
- You know?
- Oh, sure.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.337
And here it is, it's very amazing.

16:15.507 --> 16:18.271
I mean, Jack Kerouac was the rebel
role model for an entire generation

16:18.444 --> 16:19.934
and he ended up
living with his mother.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.278
- Some role model.
- Yeah.

16:22.448 --> 16:25.576
- So, what time is the lecture?
- I think 4:00.

16:25.751 --> 16:28.242
Well, I was sort of hoping
that you'd go to the pool party.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.547
Yeah, right.
"The Brady Bunch Goes to College. "

16:30.723 --> 16:32.691
Come on, Dylan, I really wanna go.

16:32.858 --> 16:35.053
So go, Kel.
You don't need my permission.

16:35.227 --> 16:36.751
But I wanted us to go together.

16:36.929 --> 16:39.090
I mean, everybody'll be there.
It'll be fun.

16:39.264 --> 16:42.825
Look, Kel, you go to the pool party,
I'll go to lecture and we'll meet up after.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.902
You can be so selfish sometimes.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.901
It's just like France all over again,
isn't it?

16:47.072 --> 16:49.165
You wrapped up in your world,
leaving me out in cold.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.741
No, this isn't like France.
All your friends are here.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.008
Fine, I will go with David and Donna.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.806
My point exactly.

16:56.882 --> 16:59.442
- You just don't care, do you?
- About what?

17:00.119 --> 17:01.746
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.683
Don't worry about me.
Don't worry about us.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.381
As far as I'm concerned,
you don't have to worry about anything.

17:17.903 --> 17:19.268
So how'd she take it, man?

17:19.438 --> 17:21.531
- Celeste is a great girl.
- I tried to tell you that.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.267
I used the old Sanders finesse,
handled it with kid gloves.

17:24.443 --> 17:25.773
Hi, Steve.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.935
- Leslie, how are you doing?
- Hi, Leslie.

17:28.113 --> 17:30.013
So am I gonna see you
at the pool party?

17:30.182 --> 17:31.547
Leslie, you're no freshman.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.447
No, I'm the Greek Council
hospitality rep.

17:34.620 --> 17:38.920
Oh, well, don't forget
to be hospitable to me.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.684
Always.

17:42.161 --> 17:45.153
Oh, God, how could I say that?

17:45.330 --> 17:47.457
What are you worried about?
You're a free man.

17:47.633 --> 17:48.657
Not quite.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.426
Not only did I not break up
with Celeste,

17:50.602 --> 17:51.933
I invited her to the pool party.

17:52.104 --> 17:53.765
I thought you were gonna break up
with her.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.372
I tried.

17:55.541 --> 17:58.533
You know, you're right, Steve.
You are a hell of a sensitive guy.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.748
Hi, do you have a minute?

18:07.152 --> 18:08.779
Come on in.

18:10.222 --> 18:13.316
I warned you about this
from the very beginning.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.687
Maybe I should come back later.

18:16.895 --> 18:19.693
How could you do this to me?
Do you know what time it is?

18:19.865 --> 18:20.923
What's on your mind?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.967
I wanted to talk to you about the
radio show I'm doing with David Silver.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.301
Fine, then don't. Goodbye.

18:30.742 --> 18:32.505
Oh, about the radio show,

18:32.678 --> 18:34.612
I really wanted to thank you
for the opportunity,

18:34.780 --> 18:38.910
but now that my classes have started,
everything has just,

18:39.084 --> 18:43.885
well, kind of changed and, I mean,
everything's a lot more demanding.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.284
What's going on?

18:45.457 --> 18:48.358
My afternoon shift didn't show up.
I need someone to fill in.

18:48.527 --> 18:49.551
And you're someone.

18:49.728 --> 18:51.457
I wanted to talk to you
about the radio show.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.723
You guys are doing a great job.
Keep up the good work.

18:53.899 --> 18:55.833
You're on in three seconds.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.102
Hi, good afternoon.

19:05.410 --> 19:06.877
This is KXCU.

19:07.045 --> 19:11.379
I'm Donna, a freshman,
a pretty confused freshman.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.747
Still figuring out what's going on.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.047
I'm still trying
to juggle everything around.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.486
Classes, my first apartment,

19:19.658 --> 19:21.489
getting my homework done
without a study hall.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.093
Now, that's a tough one.

19:23.262 --> 19:28.393
And my English teacher expects me
to write my life story in ten sentences.

19:28.567 --> 19:30.330
I mean,
maybe I'm missing something here,

19:30.502 --> 19:32.367
but who has a life like that?

19:32.538 --> 19:35.439
Just figuring out what to wear in
the morning, that takes 20 sentences.

19:35.607 --> 19:36.801
Gosh, at least.

19:41.213 --> 19:43.579
Hey, Bren, any luck on the job front?

19:43.749 --> 19:46.240
I don't know. Somehow I don't see
my future staring back at me.

19:46.418 --> 19:47.942
Look at this, part-time fortune teller

19:48.120 --> 19:50.020
- at Madame Zorina's.
- At Madame Zorina's.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.180
Very funny, guys.

19:54.626 --> 19:56.457
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

19:56.628 --> 19:58.926
Production assistant
for famous television producer.

19:59.097 --> 20:02.328
Well, that sounds right up your alley.

20:02.501 --> 20:04.025
Here goes nothing.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.202
Well, as soon as I saw the listing,

20:07.372 --> 20:09.101
I knew it would be the perfect job
for me.

20:09.274 --> 20:10.468
Because I wanna be an actress,

20:10.642 --> 20:12.735
and I figured
this would be the perfect entry.

20:12.911 --> 20:15.209
Not that I wouldn't take
my responsibilities seriously.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.974
I mean, I would make
a great production assistant for you.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.347
<i>Oh, my God,
you did Love on a Drawbridge?</i>

20:22.521 --> 20:25.217
That was my favorite show.
I never missed a single episode.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.387
Me neither.

20:29.394 --> 20:32.420
Oh, I don't know how you kept on
coming up with such ingenious stories.

20:32.598 --> 20:34.998
Especially since they were
always stuck on that drawbridge.

20:35.167 --> 20:39.069
But even though it happened
every week, it was so unexpected.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.169
And this is where you would work.

20:48.313 --> 20:51.111
- This is a nursery school.
- A daycare center.

20:51.283 --> 20:54.150
I was the first producer
to provide one for my employees.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.745
I thought you wanted
a production assistant.

20:56.922 --> 21:00.085
You would be
a babysitter-slash-production assistant.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.419
A hyphenate.

21:01.893 --> 21:04.623
This could lead to bigger
and better things, you know.

21:04.796 --> 21:07.230
What, like executive babysitter?

21:09.501 --> 21:11.731
And that was "Walking in My Shoes"
by Depeche Mode.

21:11.903 --> 21:15.066
Speaking of which, it looks like it's time
for me to be walking on out of here.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.174
But before I go,
here's one last request.

21:17.342 --> 21:20.869
And this one is from Regina
in Drake Hall.

21:25.183 --> 21:28.277
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You were beautiful.

21:28.453 --> 21:29.886
- I was?
- Oh, you better believe it.

21:30.055 --> 21:32.182
From now on, this is your shift.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.723
Oh, this is great.
David's gonna be so excited.

21:34.893 --> 21:36.690
He's been so frustrated
with the night shift.

21:36.862 --> 21:40.821
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
I can't bring David along with you.

21:40.999 --> 21:42.091
But we're a team.

21:42.267 --> 21:44.064
I still need him on the 2 to 6.

21:44.936 --> 21:46.460
But he's my boyfriend.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.606
That's your problem.
You did great, Donna.

21:48.774 --> 21:50.366
Thank you so much.
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.134
- Okay.
- Keep up the good work.

21:56.048 --> 22:00.348
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said last night.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.515
Dad, I didn't mean
to blow you off like that.

22:02.688 --> 22:05.987
No, no, no, I respect you for it.

22:06.391 --> 22:07.517
No matter how bad things get,

22:07.693 --> 22:12.596
that tough, independent spirit of yours
is probably gonna see you through.

22:12.764 --> 22:16.097
And despite the fact that half the time,
I wanna wring your neck,

22:18.503 --> 22:19.936
I'm very proud of you.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.273
So I guess I would look like
a complete jerk if I asked you

22:23.442 --> 22:25.273
whether the job offer still stands.

22:26.445 --> 22:29.005
Well, the job is yours if you want it.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.512
In fact, you can start right now.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.741
Thanks, Dad.

22:32.918 --> 22:33.942
I will work so hard.

22:34.119 --> 22:36.485
And nobody will think of me
as the boss's daughter.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.680
Well, you're hired.

22:38.857 --> 22:42.122
The first thing I need you to do,
as a matter of fact, is deliver these

22:42.294 --> 22:43.921
to Chris Charvat at her office.

22:44.096 --> 22:45.120
Address is on the label.

22:45.297 --> 22:47.857
They're very important for
a business deal she's putting together,

22:48.033 --> 22:49.728
and she has to get these
by 9:00 tonight.

22:49.901 --> 22:50.925
Okay, no problem.

22:51.103 --> 22:54.038
I just wanna stop by the campus
for this freshman social thing.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.606
I mean, it's no big deal.
I just wanted put in an appearance.

22:56.775 --> 22:58.367
That's fine. She'll be working late.

22:58.543 --> 23:02.035
- Just make sure you get to her by 9.
- Thanks, boss.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.205
I love this job.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.717
All right, gentlemen, here we go.

23:22.167 --> 23:23.191
Hey, Celeste.

23:23.368 --> 23:25.461
Hey, this is amazing.

23:25.637 --> 23:27.400
God, if they had a setup
like this at my JC,

23:27.572 --> 23:29.096
I never would have dropped out.

23:29.274 --> 23:32.141
- How do you want your burger?
- Not yet, thanks. I'll wait for Steve.

23:32.310 --> 23:33.709
Okay.

23:42.687 --> 23:43.949
Making friends wherever he goes.

23:44.122 --> 23:46.113
Well, you know Steve,
Mr. Congeniality.

23:46.291 --> 23:47.622
Yeah.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.722
Listen, if you're gonna keep
getting jealous,

23:49.895 --> 23:51.089
Steve's gonna drive you crazy.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.595
- You know how he is.
- I know.

24:02.707 --> 24:04.470
What the hell?

24:13.318 --> 24:14.376
Hi, honey.

24:14.553 --> 24:16.282
I was wondering
when you were gonna get here.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.480
I can see how lonely you are.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.824
Celeste, where are you going?

24:27.199 --> 24:30.862
Hey, so where's your boyfriend?

24:31.036 --> 24:33.971
- He couldn't make it.
- Oh, that's too bad.

24:34.906 --> 24:38.273
- You are terrible.
- The worst. Do you want a drink?

24:39.945 --> 24:41.207
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:41.379 --> 24:43.904
David, these are my new
sorority sisters, Deborah and Jennifer.

24:44.082 --> 24:46.141
And this is my one and only,
David Silver.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.615
- Hi.
- Hi, David.

24:48.186 --> 24:50.086
Wait a minute,
am I hearing an echo or something?

24:50.255 --> 24:51.950
Were you on the radio
this afternoon?

24:52.123 --> 24:53.454
Yeah, was that you?

24:56.528 --> 24:58.928
I didn't know
you had your own radio show.

24:59.097 --> 25:00.189
Neither did I.

25:00.365 --> 25:03.129
She was so great. Like the way
you handled those requests?

25:03.301 --> 25:04.734
That guy who called in
for Megadeth?

25:04.903 --> 25:05.927
And the bit that you did

25:06.104 --> 25:08.402
about having to clean up
for your roommates was hysterical.

25:08.573 --> 25:09.597
Yeah, really.

25:09.774 --> 25:12.800
God, it sounds like you're living
with a bunch of slobs.

25:12.978 --> 25:16.243
Could you excuse us
for one second?

25:20.418 --> 25:23.512
Look, David,
I never called you a slob.

25:23.688 --> 25:24.882
No, I don't care about that.

25:25.056 --> 25:26.648
I thought you said
you were gonna quit.

25:26.825 --> 25:27.917
I was.

25:28.426 --> 25:30.053
Then how did you get
on the air again?

25:30.228 --> 25:32.162
The DJ that was supposed to be there
never showed,

25:32.330 --> 25:35.026
before I knew what was happening,
Howard had me in the booth.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.158
So does that mean
we get the day shift?

25:38.036 --> 25:42.530
I don't know how to break this
to you, but it's not we.

25:42.707 --> 25:43.731
More like me.

25:44.142 --> 25:46.736
What? I thought we were a team.

25:46.912 --> 25:49.005
I tried to tell Howard that.

25:49.180 --> 25:51.410
Well, obviously you didn't try
hard enough.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.744
David, I didn't do that to you
on purpose.

25:53.919 --> 25:55.352
Then why did you do it at all?

25:56.054 --> 25:57.715
Do you really think I'm that selfish?

25:58.490 --> 25:59.752
All right, listen up, everybody.

25:59.925 --> 26:01.916
In 15 minutes, we'll be starting
the dance contest.

26:02.093 --> 26:05.824
So choose your partners
and listen for the next announcement.

26:05.997 --> 26:07.089
Come on, let's go dance.

26:07.265 --> 26:09.256
- No, I'm not in the mood.
- David.

26:09.434 --> 26:11.902
Listen, why don't you go dance
by yourself, all right?

26:12.070 --> 26:13.901
I mean, that's what you want anyway,
isn't it?

26:19.177 --> 26:21.873
- Wait, tomatoes?
- Tomatoes.

26:23.882 --> 26:26.783
You really know how
to work a hot dog. Look at this.

26:27.819 --> 26:30.652
- Tomato, yes. Good.
- Yeah, tomato.

26:34.492 --> 26:36.756
Haven't you ever had tomato
on your hot dog?

26:36.928 --> 26:38.862
I am now.

26:39.698 --> 26:41.188
Hi.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.430
Dylan, hi.

26:44.836 --> 26:47.327
You remember John Sears
from West Beverly.

26:47.505 --> 26:48.597
Not really.

26:48.773 --> 26:51.264
Nice to meet you.
Kelly and I were just talking about you.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.035
And here I am.

26:53.211 --> 26:55.145
Well, it's nice to see you.

26:55.313 --> 26:57.247
Tell me, which frat house
are you gonna pledge to?

26:57.916 --> 26:59.281
Crack house.

27:00.518 --> 27:01.576
Great.

27:05.056 --> 27:07.115
I'll see you guys later.

27:11.563 --> 27:15.863
We could have a fight right now,
but that's not why you came, is it?

27:16.034 --> 27:18.229
No, the only reason I'm here
is to be with you.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.168
Well, I'm glad you're here.

27:22.107 --> 27:25.042
I'm glad too. Come on.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.373
Andrea, what are you doing?

27:31.783 --> 27:33.273
I'm working on my essay
for your class.

27:33.451 --> 27:34.918
I can't get these transitions right.

27:35.086 --> 27:37.213
Why aren't you at the pool party?

27:37.389 --> 27:39.516
I wouldn't enjoy myself,
knowing I had work to do.

27:39.691 --> 27:42.285
Andrea, the essay can wait.
It's not that important.

27:42.460 --> 27:47.124
Save and exit. Go.

27:47.298 --> 27:49.391
- Go.
- Wait.

27:49.567 --> 27:51.057
All right, I'm going, I'm going.

27:51.236 --> 27:52.760
Oh, my God, turn, turn.

28:00.145 --> 28:03.080
Excuse me. Excuse me, guys.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.616
- You wanna get something to drink?
- No, thanks.

28:08.319 --> 28:11.083
I'm sorry, I got so carried away
over there. You know how it is.

28:11.256 --> 28:13.247
My pledge buddies.
They're a great bunch of guys.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.188
I'm glad you came.

28:17.829 --> 28:21.731
Hey, Sanders, get over here.
Wait till you see what Ronson's got.

28:22.934 --> 28:23.958
I'll be right back.

28:45.657 --> 28:46.851
- Brenda, I'm desperate.
- What?

28:47.025 --> 28:48.856
You've gotta help me,
David's really upset.

28:49.027 --> 28:51.359
- What happened?
- Okay, listen up, everybody, listen up.

28:51.529 --> 28:53.759
As promised,
it's time for the dance contest.

28:53.932 --> 28:57.095
Now, best frosh dancers
win straight A's for two semesters.

28:57.268 --> 29:00.726
Or a $25 gift certificate
to Poncho's Pizza. It's your choice.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.873
Come on, what do you say?

29:03.041 --> 29:04.201
- What? That?
- Come on, yeah.

29:04.375 --> 29:06.468
No way, you're lucky I'm even here.
Don't push it.

29:06.644 --> 29:07.838
You want a soda?

29:08.012 --> 29:09.946
- All right.
- Come on.

29:14.319 --> 29:16.014
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:16.187 --> 29:17.518
What's your major?

29:17.689 --> 29:20.783
I'm Brenda Walsh. I'm studying
pre-law, premed and premenstrual.

29:20.959 --> 29:22.551
I'm not really sure which one.

29:24.329 --> 29:27.526
David, come on, I thought
that you'd be the first one out there.

29:27.699 --> 29:30.167
Have you ever been stabbed
in the back by somebody you trusted?

29:31.302 --> 29:32.929
Yeah, I'm an old hand at that.

29:35.740 --> 29:38.004
Well, this looks
like a pretty dead crowd.

29:38.176 --> 29:41.839
What do you say we go show
these college types how it's done?

29:49.921 --> 29:51.616
I'll be right back.

29:53.258 --> 29:56.523
Hey, Steve, I've been looking for you
all over the place. Let's dance.

29:56.694 --> 29:59.686
- Leslie, I'd love to dance with you...
- Then go ahead.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.266
Cel.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.971
Hi, Brandon,
how would you like to dance?

30:11.142 --> 30:13.235
Boy, did you pick the wrong guy.

30:13.411 --> 30:14.673
Andrea, I'm so glad you're here.

30:14.846 --> 30:16.871
Now, I finally have someone
to stand around with.

30:17.048 --> 30:19.073
Forget it, Brandon. I'm dancing.

30:19.250 --> 30:22.913
Come on, Andrea.
Let's go find some guys with legs.

30:23.555 --> 30:24.749
Yeah.

30:24.923 --> 30:26.652
Now, don't stop now.
Come on, everybody.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.726
Everybody,
come on, it's a pool party.

30:29.894 --> 30:33.057
Don't stop, don't stop, it's a contest.

30:33.231 --> 30:36.962
Now bop till you drop,
you know what I mean?

30:37.135 --> 30:38.864
Come on, yeah.

30:39.037 --> 30:43.030
Shake, shake, shake. Yeah.

31:01.626 --> 31:03.025
Celeste.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.094
Celeste, what's wrong with you?

31:05.263 --> 31:07.197
Hey, come on,
I wasn't gonna dance with her.

31:07.365 --> 31:10.528
If I'm baggage to you, just tell me now.
Let's just get it over with, okay?

31:10.702 --> 31:13.262
What are you talking about?
I asked you to come with me, didn't I?

31:13.438 --> 31:15.303
No, you didn't. I asked you.

31:15.473 --> 31:17.771
If I hadn't brought it up,
you never would've mentioned it.

31:17.942 --> 31:19.534
You're blowing this
way out of proportion.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.544
Why don't you just give me
a chance to explain?

31:22.714 --> 31:24.579
Celeste.

31:47.272 --> 31:49.934
We're having a good time now,
aren't we?

31:51.075 --> 31:54.067
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop.

31:56.881 --> 31:58.178
Nice to see you.

31:58.349 --> 32:01.045
Sorry, guys, get off the floor.

32:11.729 --> 32:15.062
We're reaching down, we're reaching
down. Getting close to the wire.

32:15.233 --> 32:19.431
Who's gonna make it?
Come on, spread out, spread out.

32:19.604 --> 32:22.937
Only the best can win.
Do you hear what I'm saying?

32:25.610 --> 32:27.771
All right, you're gone.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.005
Sorry, guys.

32:31.649 --> 32:33.344
Who's left? Who's left?
Who's it's gonna be?

32:34.285 --> 32:35.513
Come on, get them.

32:42.060 --> 32:44.324
Okay, we have a lot
of incredible dancers here.

32:44.495 --> 32:45.757
But the winners...

32:45.930 --> 32:48.797
The winners
of the freshman dance contest are...

32:48.967 --> 32:50.434
- Brenda Walsh.
- And David Silver.

32:50.601 --> 32:55.504
Okay, how about a big round
of applause for Brenda and David?

33:03.181 --> 33:04.546
Have a nice swim.

33:08.586 --> 33:09.848
No!

33:10.021 --> 33:11.886
Everybody in the pool!

33:20.531 --> 33:23.227
- Threw me in the pool?
- Yeah.

33:25.636 --> 33:27.695
- Ready to go under?
- Yeah.

33:28.506 --> 33:29.700
Admit it, you had a great time.

33:29.874 --> 33:32.468
Yeah, don't ever make me
do this again.

33:32.643 --> 33:33.667
No!

33:39.417 --> 33:41.214
I'm ready to go.

33:42.053 --> 33:45.989
Listen, Donna,
I'm sorry I acted like such an idiot.

33:46.557 --> 33:49.720
I mean, I know you'd never
do anything to hurt me,

33:50.094 --> 33:53.552
and there I was, letting my ego keep
you from getting what you deserve.

33:54.432 --> 33:57.333
We both deserve it,
and we'll both get it.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.567
Being on the radio
in high school changed me.

34:00.738 --> 34:05.801
I mean, somehow I went
from geek to celebrity.

34:08.012 --> 34:09.342
I guess what really freaked me out

34:09.514 --> 34:11.982
is that maybe
I couldn't do it on my own.

34:13.150 --> 34:16.678
I'd just go back to being
the same old nerdy David Silver.

34:18.121 --> 34:20.056
David, you taught me
everything I know.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.989
You were great before me,
and you'll do great now.

34:26.597 --> 34:27.655
Thanks.

34:35.606 --> 34:37.369
Let's get out of here.

34:38.275 --> 34:39.436
Let's go find Brenda.

34:40.311 --> 34:42.245
Did you guys see
that huge guy dancing?

34:42.413 --> 34:44.973
You know, the one with the redhead?
I mean, he was incredible.

34:45.149 --> 34:46.706
He must have weighed,
like, 300 pounds,

34:46.884 --> 34:49.045
but seriously, he had some moves.
He was amazing.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.449
No, no, what about the guy
in the yellow shirt?

34:51.621 --> 34:53.214
Now, I thought for sure
he was gonna win.

34:53.391 --> 34:54.415
He had some moves.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.186
Well, you guys, I had
a tremendous amount of fun, as usual.

34:57.361 --> 34:58.919
Thank you.

35:00.865 --> 35:02.389
Oh, my God.

35:02.567 --> 35:05.195
I forgot
to deliver my father's contract.

35:06.437 --> 35:09.964
Oh, I really blew it.
I gotta get out of here. Bye.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.621
I should have just told Leslie
to take a hike.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.783
Steve, you were avoiding Celeste
all day.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.258
I was not, I was with my friends.

35:31.429 --> 35:33.624
- And what is Celeste, your enemy?
- No, she's...

35:33.798 --> 35:36.824
Maybe you just can't deal with the idea
of her breaking up with you.

35:37.001 --> 35:39.094
All right, I screwed up.
Now what am I gonna do?

35:40.271 --> 35:43.638
Well, in situations like this,
there only is one thing ever to do.

35:43.808 --> 35:46.106
- What's that?
- Beg.

35:47.211 --> 35:48.303
That's not gonna work.

35:48.880 --> 35:52.611
I mean, this girl is really pissed off
at me, and she's got every right to be.

35:54.418 --> 35:55.942
I think I'm falling in love with her.

35:58.389 --> 36:00.857
I haven't felt this way about a girl
since Kelly.

36:01.292 --> 36:03.089
Then why do you act
the way you do?

36:04.061 --> 36:07.292
Sometimes I follow my heart,
and everything's okay.

36:08.566 --> 36:11.660
But then Mr. Greenjeans
has his own ideas.

36:12.937 --> 36:15.997
You know,
I bet if you went to Celeste

36:16.174 --> 36:18.836
and just admitted to her
that you were a horse's ass,

36:19.010 --> 36:20.034
she might forgive you.

36:20.211 --> 36:22.304
Admit that you're a horse's ass.

36:22.747 --> 36:24.009
I don't think that's gonna work.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.712
Well, everyone's allowed
to make a mistake.

36:30.555 --> 36:32.182
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Bren.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.221
- Hey, Brenda.
- Hey.

36:34.959 --> 36:36.426
Hi, Dad.

36:37.995 --> 36:39.223
What's wrong, Brenda?

36:40.665 --> 36:44.692
Well, I got to the office,
just like you said, but she wasn't there.

36:45.603 --> 36:47.434
Did you leave the contracts
with her assistant?

36:48.272 --> 36:50.172
Well, her assistant
wasn't there either.

36:51.642 --> 36:54.873
- Actually, the building was closed.
- What time did you get there?

36:56.781 --> 36:57.839
Nine o'clock.

36:58.849 --> 37:01.841
Didn't I tell you how important
those contracts are?

37:02.019 --> 37:04.112
Didn't I tell you
she has to get them tonight?

37:04.288 --> 37:06.119
Well, can't we have them delivered
to her home?

37:06.290 --> 37:08.520
She's already left for New York.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.028
- I don't know what we're gonna do.
- How about faxing them?

37:12.196 --> 37:15.723
That's not the point.
I gave you one responsibility.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.767
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- Sorry isn't gonna cut it.

37:18.936 --> 37:21.131
Dad, please,
I know that I screwed up.

37:21.672 --> 37:24.300
But from now on,
I promise I'll be more careful.

37:25.943 --> 37:28.173
Look, Dad, please give me
a second chance. Don't fire me.

37:28.346 --> 37:30.280
Everyone's allowed
to make a mistake.

37:39.423 --> 37:40.549
You're not fired.

37:41.692 --> 37:42.784
Thanks, Dad.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.951
Thank your brother.

37:48.899 --> 37:51.265
Donna, you don't have
to keep me company. I'm okay, really.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.630
I'm gonna be up half the night
writing my essay anyway,

37:53.804 --> 37:55.237
so I might as well be with you.

37:55.406 --> 37:56.430
David...

37:56.607 --> 37:59.167
Oh, Donna, hey.
Great, this saves me a phone call.

37:59.343 --> 38:01.038
You're here late, aren't you?

38:01.212 --> 38:04.204
Listen, I won't be needing you
to come in in the afternoons after all.

38:04.982 --> 38:07.815
The DJ that didn't show
changed her mind.

38:07.985 --> 38:09.077
What?

38:09.253 --> 38:12.416
And since she's my girlfriend...

38:12.790 --> 38:14.280
Your girlfriend?

38:14.458 --> 38:15.982
Yeah, well, you two know
how tough it is

38:16.160 --> 38:18.424
mixing business with pleasure.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.755
Anyway, Sally and I broke up
and we've worked it out.

38:22.933 --> 38:25.663
So I guess she'll be getting
her old slot back.

38:26.203 --> 38:28.569
So keep up the good work.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.571
You know, there's still an open chair
here on the night shift.

38:37.848 --> 38:41.682
No, I think I've had quite enough
of this for a while.

38:55.599 --> 38:57.226
Thank you.

38:57.768 --> 38:59.326
Celeste.

38:59.937 --> 39:03.429
Celeste, I came to apologize.
Come on, don't run away.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.032
Cel.

39:06.210 --> 39:08.007
Celeste.

39:08.546 --> 39:11.140
I'm really sorry for how I acted.

39:12.316 --> 39:14.784
I guess I'm sort of
adjusting to college.

39:14.952 --> 39:16.920
It's like a period of transition for me.

39:18.222 --> 39:19.814
New friends, new life.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.623
Cel, that is not how I meant it.

39:23.127 --> 39:25.425
Steve, I accept your apology.

39:27.598 --> 39:30.431
Cel. Celeste.

39:31.168 --> 39:33.159
I'm really sorry.

39:34.238 --> 39:37.036
I acted like a jerk, I know that.
What can I say?

39:38.175 --> 39:39.403
I was trying to score points.

39:39.577 --> 39:42.808
I was busy trying to be
the big man on campus.

39:44.348 --> 39:46.339
Everything you accused me of
was true.

39:49.687 --> 39:52.383
I wish there was some way
I could undo it.

39:55.860 --> 39:57.521
You really hurt me.

39:59.363 --> 40:03.424
I promise I'll never do it again.

40:05.269 --> 40:08.534
You do and you'll never score
another point.

40:10.574 --> 40:12.235
Does this mean I can still see you?

40:15.179 --> 40:16.771
Oh, baby.

40:22.119 --> 40:25.714
"Being accepted by Yale was probably
the honor of which I was most proud.

40:25.890 --> 40:27.915
However, the responsibilities
of money and family

40:28.092 --> 40:29.821
could not have been ignored.

40:29.994 --> 40:32.326
In conclusion, I have learned
that what sometimes appears

40:32.496 --> 40:34.555
to be the most attractive alternative

40:34.732 --> 40:37.428
is not always
the most appropriate one. "

40:40.304 --> 40:41.999
Any comments?

40:43.407 --> 40:44.897
Well...

40:45.409 --> 40:48.310
It's obvious this student is very bright
and she's worked very hard.

40:48.479 --> 40:51.414
But it doesn't sound like
a human being wrote this, does it?

40:52.116 --> 40:53.743
I want your writing to sound like you,

40:53.918 --> 40:55.886
not what you think
good writing should be.

40:58.088 --> 41:00.784
Here's another essay.
See if you can hear the difference.

41:00.958 --> 41:03.392
- Donna.
- Yes?

41:03.561 --> 41:05.620
I want you to read your essay
for the class.

41:05.796 --> 41:07.764
Class, this is Donna Martin.

41:08.732 --> 41:10.131
Hi.

41:15.840 --> 41:19.105
"My first walking shoes
are bronzed in my father's office.

41:19.276 --> 41:22.973
Sometimes I think that's how
he wants to remember me.

41:23.147 --> 41:25.047
When I first started school,
my mother bought me

41:25.216 --> 41:27.548
a pair of black
patent leather Mary Janes.

41:27.718 --> 41:29.208
The other kids
were all wearing bucks,

41:29.386 --> 41:32.116
but my mother insisted
that my Mary Jane's were prettier.

41:32.523 --> 41:34.184
Finally, when I was in the fifth grade,

41:34.358 --> 41:37.691
I talked her into letting me have
a pair of high purple suede boots.

41:37.862 --> 41:41.821
She said they made me
look precocious, but I loved them.

41:41.999 --> 41:45.298
In junior high,
I bought a pair of Doc Martens.

41:45.469 --> 41:48.768
My father, who's a doctor,
thought I was making fun of him.

41:48.939 --> 41:51.772
And after a big fight,
they stayed in the closet. "

42:04.622 --> 42:07.489
So you think my writing stinks, huh?

42:07.658 --> 42:09.489
Not at all.

42:10.327 --> 42:14.855
But the point of the assignment
was to let me know who you are.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.594
Well, I wrote
about a very difficult decision.

42:18.769 --> 42:22.603
Yes, and you made it seem
like the easiest thing in the world.

42:23.173 --> 42:25.368
You hid behind your intelligence.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.103
You never revealed
what goes on inside of you.

42:28.279 --> 42:29.303
What makes you unique.

42:31.315 --> 42:32.543
I just...

42:32.716 --> 42:34.377
I didn't wanna make a fool of myself.

42:34.552 --> 42:37.180
Well, I guess that's the chance
you have to take.

42:37.988 --> 42:39.455
But until you're willing to risk it,

42:39.623 --> 42:42.023
you're never gonna know
who you are.

42:42.192 --> 42:44.057
You're never gonna grow.

42:44.228 --> 42:48.494
You'll always be Andrea Zuckerman,
West Beverly valedictorian.

42:48.666 --> 42:50.463
She's a smart girl.

42:50.634 --> 42:52.864
But who the hell is she?

42:54.972 --> 42:57.566
So how are your table manners?

42:58.776 --> 42:59.800
My what?

42:59.977 --> 43:02.138
Would I be embarrassed
going out to dinner with you?

43:03.581 --> 43:05.105
No.

43:05.516 --> 43:07.746
My table manners
are one of my best qualities.

43:07.918 --> 43:11.319
Good. Then I'll see you tonight.

43:11.488 --> 43:12.978
Okay?

43:13.357 --> 43:14.551
Okay.

43:17.461 --> 43:18.860
Great.

43:27.571 --> 43:29.471
I'll get it, Kelly.

43:34.878 --> 43:37.039
So, what is it today?

43:37.214 --> 43:39.774
<i>"Introduction to Psychology. "</i>

43:41.485 --> 43:42.884
What are you doing here?

43:43.053 --> 43:44.987
You know what I'm doing here.

43:45.689 --> 43:47.816
And don't say any more
about Dylan.

43:47.992 --> 43:50.324
You keep telling me
you have a boyfriend,

43:50.494 --> 43:52.257
but you never tell me to go away.

43:53.097 --> 43:55.930
And you never tell me
to leave you alone.

43:56.100 --> 43:57.465
Yes, I do.

43:58.068 --> 43:59.626
Maybe you think you do.

43:59.803 --> 44:01.236
Just give me one chance, Kelly.

44:17.755 --> 44:19.950
Please leave me alone.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
