00:03.290 --> 00:06.225
What is the point of this thing
without a GPS signal?

00:07.760 --> 00:09.861
Lara, there's a map
next to you, darling.

00:09.895 --> 00:11.629
I need to wee.

00:11.664 --> 00:13.765
A map? Really?

00:13.799 --> 00:15.066
I know, a bit medieval, huh?

00:15.100 --> 00:17.268
But it doesn't require a signal

00:17.303 --> 00:18.670
or a 70-page
instruction manual.

00:19.905 --> 00:21.205
I need to wee.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.041
Lara, please.

00:23.075 --> 00:24.208
There's a map...

00:25.411 --> 00:27.412
Look at this truck.

00:29.782 --> 00:31.082
He will go around.

00:32.750 --> 00:33.885
He's not slowing!

00:34.987 --> 00:35.954
Hey, go around!

00:35.988 --> 00:37.121
You think he can hear you?

00:37.156 --> 00:38.923
I need to wee!

00:38.958 --> 00:40.892
Hey! Go around!

00:40.926 --> 00:41.959
What is he doing?

00:43.262 --> 00:44.228
Honey!
Honey, get off!

00:44.263 --> 00:45.863
Get off!
Get out of his way! Move over!

00:52.204 --> 00:54.205
I really need to wee.

00:55.074 --> 00:56.808
Look.

00:56.842 --> 00:58.076
There's a rest stop.

01:12.124 --> 01:15.126
Guten morgen, Kommissar Berger.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.929
Good morning, sir.

01:17.963 --> 01:21.799
There are parks in
The Hague, you know.

01:21.834 --> 01:24.346
I can recommend Clingendael.

01:24.466 --> 01:26.904
I often get lost
in the Japanese garden.

01:26.939 --> 01:30.108
This is the Parc
de Saint-Cloud in Paris?

01:30.142 --> 01:33.044
Where the diplomat's
last victim was found.

01:33.078 --> 01:34.412
The killer is standing
somewhere out here,

01:34.446 --> 01:36.247
only...

01:36.282 --> 01:37.882
I didn't get him.

01:37.916 --> 01:39.083
My scangen fell short.

01:39.118 --> 01:40.952
If I could only find a way

01:40.986 --> 01:42.954
to extend the borders
of the scan

01:42.988 --> 01:46.090
to not require
as precise a sensor.

01:46.125 --> 01:48.793
Well, I'll leave you
to your work.

01:51.096 --> 01:52.877
I can still see her smiling...

01:54.867 --> 01:56.834
I beg your pardon?

01:56.869 --> 02:00.171
Sienna, she...

02:00.205 --> 02:01.806
her eyes smiled, you know?

02:03.842 --> 02:04.742
I can still see them.

02:04.777 --> 02:07.245
I can erase these files,

02:07.279 --> 02:11.082
but not the memory.

02:11.116 --> 02:14.352
Well, the inability
to erase a memory,

02:14.386 --> 02:18.890
to simply hit "delete,"

02:18.924 --> 02:20.391
is what makes us human.

02:21.794 --> 02:24.962
You don't want to lose
that, Sebastian.

02:42.081 --> 02:43.114
Mommy! Mommy!

02:43.148 --> 02:44.349
I want these candies!

02:44.383 --> 02:46.851
Okay.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.153
Family...

02:49.188 --> 02:52.090
most important thing in life.

02:54.526 --> 02:58.296
Sure, next to football, beer,

02:58.330 --> 02:59.530
and an occasional nap...

02:59.565 --> 03:02.367
Let's keep that between us.

03:02.401 --> 03:04.068
Good to go.

03:04.103 --> 03:05.436
Great.
Thanks.

03:05.471 --> 03:06.871
No, thank you.

03:06.905 --> 03:08.539
Grateful for the business.

03:10.576 --> 03:13.311
Hey! I'm Ivonne.

03:15.047 --> 03:17.482
Going over to Poland?

03:17.516 --> 03:19.150
Yeah. Skiing, why?

03:19.184 --> 03:20.385
Do you need a ride?

03:20.419 --> 03:21.452
Excuse me?

03:22.921 --> 03:24.856
Honey. It's cold.

03:24.890 --> 03:26.090
We don't have room, sorry.

03:26.125 --> 03:27.892
Of course we do.

03:27.927 --> 03:29.060
We can squeeze.

03:29.094 --> 03:31.262
We don't have room.

03:31.297 --> 03:32.997
Sorry.

03:33.999 --> 03:36.301
No problem.

03:38.103 --> 03:38.936
Bitch.

03:45.311 --> 03:46.911
Hickman.

03:46.946 --> 03:48.546
Hey, kid.

04:00.525 --> 04:01.492
How you feeling?

04:01.526 --> 04:03.527
Like I want to
jump out of my skin.

04:05.597 --> 04:06.964
How is it you Americans say it?

04:06.998 --> 04:07.731
Bugsy? Or...

04:07.766 --> 04:08.966
Antsy.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.935
I'm feeling antsy.

04:12.938 --> 04:14.505
Wow, you got...

04:14.539 --> 04:16.730
A lot of stuff.

04:16.850 --> 04:19.976
Yeah, the whole team
was here last night.

04:20.011 --> 04:22.913
Eva, Tommy, Sebastian,

04:22.948 --> 04:26.216
and even Major Daniel
sent me flowers.

04:26.251 --> 04:29.820
I brought you some, um...

04:31.923 --> 04:34.191
I don't know
what you'd call these.

04:34.226 --> 04:35.726
Logic puzzles? I...

04:37.095 --> 04:38.329
Logic puzzles.

04:38.363 --> 04:40.464
Yeah, they're like, you know,
a workout for the brain.

04:40.498 --> 04:41.699
Pass the time.

04:46.071 --> 04:47.905
That's very nice of you.

04:47.939 --> 04:50.474
Hmm...

04:50.508 --> 04:51.242
Anyway, um...

04:51.276 --> 04:52.977
I gotta go.

05:00.118 --> 05:01.218
I'll check in on you later.

05:01.253 --> 05:02.753
Oh, it's okay, you don't...

05:02.787 --> 05:04.054
you don't have to, it's...

05:05.991 --> 05:08.659
Actually,
that would be really nice.

05:13.732 --> 05:14.732
See ya.

05:19.571 --> 05:21.105
I'm going away on a trip.

05:21.139 --> 05:23.807
I don't know
how long I'll be gone,

05:23.842 --> 05:26.043
but if something
comes up for your team,

05:26.077 --> 05:28.045
I might not be available.

05:28.079 --> 05:30.547
Well, it seems quiet now.

05:30.582 --> 05:33.117
Yeah,
but you're always looking.

05:33.151 --> 05:36.887
I've instructed my office
to find me if you call.

05:36.922 --> 05:39.774
It might take some time,
but I'll get the message.

05:39.894 --> 05:43.727
Thank you very much, Dorn,
for all your help.

05:47.327 --> 05:48.966
You weren't surprised,
were you?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.534
Surprised?

05:50.569 --> 05:52.136
When I gave you the file

05:52.170 --> 05:54.939
and told you that the man
responsible for the bomb

05:54.973 --> 05:56.106
was named Dimitrov,

05:56.141 --> 05:57.908
you weren't surprised.

05:57.943 --> 05:59.543
I asked you if you were sure.

05:59.578 --> 06:01.145
Yeah, but you
weren't surprised.

06:01.179 --> 06:02.713
Because I knew his name.

06:02.747 --> 06:04.615
In what context?

06:04.649 --> 06:05.916
He may be involved

06:05.951 --> 06:07.651
in the drug ring
I was investigating.

06:07.686 --> 06:11.855
I was tracking a street crew,

06:11.890 --> 06:13.624
but Dimitrov was never
my direct target.

06:13.658 --> 06:16.026
Is there anything else
you haven't told me?

06:18.630 --> 06:22.166
I never kept information
from you, Dorn.

06:22.200 --> 06:24.034
I asked you if you were sure

06:24.069 --> 06:25.836
because I was not.

06:29.307 --> 06:32.276
You are most welcome, Louis.

06:32.310 --> 06:35.079
For all my help.

07:01.273 --> 07:02.373
Whoa.
What the...?

07:02.407 --> 07:04.174
Come on.

07:04.209 --> 07:05.175
What is it?

07:05.210 --> 07:05.943
I don't believe this.

07:14.986 --> 07:17.988
Huh. Perfect.
No signal.

07:29.301 --> 07:30.367
And...?

07:30.402 --> 07:31.735
And I'm an attorney.

07:31.770 --> 07:33.137
What do I know about engines?

07:37.042 --> 07:38.142
Oh.

07:38.176 --> 07:40.277
There's somebody coming.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.380
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow.

07:43.415 --> 07:44.415
Slow!

07:44.449 --> 07:45.916
Oh!

07:45.951 --> 07:47.885
Hey, hey, hey!

07:47.919 --> 07:49.787
Oh, great.

07:52.991 --> 07:55.259
Hi.

07:55.293 --> 07:56.794
Uh, we broke down.

07:58.430 --> 08:00.130
We don't have room.

08:02.167 --> 08:04.401
Are you sure, Ivonne?

08:04.436 --> 08:06.170
Oh, I'm sure.

08:06.204 --> 08:07.338
You heard the lady.

08:12.844 --> 08:13.777
This is my fault

08:13.812 --> 08:15.246
for not letting
that slut in our car?

08:15.280 --> 08:16.981
Why do you have
to call her that?

08:19.084 --> 08:20.284
There.

08:20.318 --> 08:21.719
Somebody else is coming.

09:13.031 --> 09:17.010

==sync, correction by <font color=#00ff00>dcdah</font>==
for www.addic7ed.com

09:40.411 --> 09:43.210
She was found near a highway this
morning just outside Berlin.

09:44.798 --> 09:46.365
How is this a case for us?

09:46.399 --> 09:47.866
I've been implementing
a pattern recognition program

09:47.901 --> 09:48.867
I designed...

09:48.902 --> 09:50.169
What?

09:50.203 --> 09:51.804
It scans and correlates
anomalies

09:51.838 --> 09:54.840
within a specific time frame
and regional links

09:54.874 --> 09:56.375
which otherwise
might go unnoticed.

09:56.409 --> 09:58.277
All right, simple, then, yeah.

09:58.311 --> 10:00.145
It detected
this abandoned sports car

10:00.180 --> 10:01.146
near a Polish highway

10:01.181 --> 10:02.414
just across the border
from Germany.

10:02.449 --> 10:04.516
Hang on.

10:04.551 --> 10:06.719
An abandoned car in Poland?

10:06.753 --> 10:07.887
I'll gear up.

10:07.921 --> 10:09.488
I mean, what's next,
speeding on the autobahn?

10:09.523 --> 10:11.757
Or double-parking
in London, maybe?

10:11.791 --> 10:13.292
I asked Polish Highway Police

10:13.326 --> 10:15.594
to take pictures
of the car interior...

10:16.830 --> 10:17.830
Et voila.

10:17.864 --> 10:21.267
That is
a very red hair.

10:23.403 --> 10:24.770
According to Polish forensics,

10:24.804 --> 10:26.272
the hair is a match.
The dead Berlin girl

10:26.306 --> 10:28.440
was sitting in that black
Polish sports car.

10:28.475 --> 10:30.342
Are there plates on it?

10:30.377 --> 10:31.544
Nope. But the controls
are all in German.

10:31.578 --> 10:33.445
I'd say that crosses borders.

10:33.480 --> 10:34.580
Yeah, but not ongoing.

10:34.614 --> 10:36.415
Okay?

10:36.449 --> 10:38.350
I spoke to
my former Berlin unit.

10:38.385 --> 10:39.918
I can scan the area
where the corpse was found.

10:39.953 --> 10:40.920
Unofficially.

10:40.954 --> 10:43.622
Fine. Carl,

10:43.657 --> 10:45.190
I need you to go with him.

10:45.225 --> 10:47.660
What could be better
than Germany in the wintertime?

10:54.901 --> 10:57.703
You do not travel light,
Sebastian.

10:59.940 --> 11:00.940
Sebastian!

11:02.742 --> 11:03.576
Kathrin.

11:04.778 --> 11:05.477
Hey.

11:05.512 --> 11:06.946
How are you?

11:06.980 --> 11:08.347
Good.
How are you?

11:08.381 --> 11:09.515
Good.

11:09.549 --> 11:11.750
Kriminalhauptkommissarin
Eichholz, Polizei Berlin,

11:11.785 --> 11:13.819
Detective Hickman, former NYPD,

11:13.854 --> 11:15.221
currently with the ICC.

11:15.255 --> 11:16.221
Good to meet you.

11:16.256 --> 11:18.257
How did you make it
here so fast?

11:18.291 --> 11:19.858
We actually have
our own chopper.

11:19.893 --> 11:21.527
You've moved up in the world.

11:21.561 --> 11:24.330
Well, it doesn't belong to me.
Yet.

11:24.364 --> 11:26.231
Still, you know
what kind of resources

11:26.266 --> 11:27.466
we have around here.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.834
The, uh, crime scene?

11:28.869 --> 11:30.336
Of course. Follow me.

11:31.938 --> 11:33.672
Victim is about
20 years of age.

11:33.707 --> 11:36.542
A man's dog dug up the body.
No identification.

11:36.576 --> 11:38.777
Some stab wounds
and multiple blunt trauma.

11:38.812 --> 11:41.247
Pathologist estimates death
within the last 48 hours.

11:41.281 --> 11:43.349
There is a connection
across the border to Poland.

11:43.383 --> 11:45.551
Your victim's hair was found

11:45.585 --> 11:47.253
in a car abandoned there.

11:47.287 --> 11:48.520
Why don't I know about that?

11:48.555 --> 11:51.323
When was the last time
you shared anything with Warsaw?

11:51.358 --> 11:52.458
Ugh, well...

11:52.492 --> 11:54.460
That's why we're here.

11:57.564 --> 11:58.564
Oh, one more thing.

11:58.598 --> 11:59.932
There's DNA on her body

11:59.966 --> 12:01.667
that appears to be
from another source.

12:01.701 --> 12:05.037
Preliminary testing shows
another blood type on her,

12:05.071 --> 12:06.272
so I can text you the results.

12:06.306 --> 12:07.573
I just need your numbers.

12:10.076 --> 12:12.945
I haven't seen these
in a while.

12:12.979 --> 12:14.446
So you and your girlfriend

12:14.481 --> 12:17.383
seem to be having
a nice little reunion.

12:17.417 --> 12:18.717
Negative.

12:18.752 --> 12:19.685
Come on,

12:19.719 --> 12:20.853
she slipped you her cell number

12:20.887 --> 12:22.421
by texting you blood results.

12:22.455 --> 12:24.390
She sent it to you, too.

12:24.424 --> 12:25.591
She had to cover.

12:27.994 --> 12:29.628
I haven't seen her
in more than six years.

12:29.663 --> 12:31.497
So you guys never
really had anything?

12:31.531 --> 12:32.698
I didn't say that.

12:32.732 --> 12:34.400
Ready!

12:35.101 --> 12:36.068
Scanning.

12:43.843 --> 12:46.045
Look at that.

12:46.079 --> 12:47.379
I've added some capabilities

12:47.414 --> 12:48.380
to the scangen,

12:48.415 --> 12:51.317
sort of ground
penetrating option.

12:51.351 --> 12:53.786
What does that
look like to you?

12:55.956 --> 12:58.591
No...

13:19.846 --> 13:21.480
We're here, Sebastian.

13:21.515 --> 13:22.982
<i>Forensics and pathology</i>
<i>still have their hands full,</i>

13:23.016 --> 13:24.917
<i>but, so far,</i>

13:24.951 --> 13:25.985
at least seven corpses

13:26.019 --> 13:27.820
in various stages
of decomposition.

13:27.854 --> 13:29.054
<i>We've got a dumping ground.</i>

13:29.089 --> 13:32.591
Might be a serial killer,
might be organized crime.

13:32.626 --> 13:34.560
Both are territorial.

13:34.594 --> 13:36.529
I don't know, the last victim

13:36.563 --> 13:39.498
didn't look like the type
or motive for a hit.

13:39.533 --> 13:40.799
No, she looks like a punker

13:40.834 --> 13:42.568
who got hit with
a hot bag of doorknobs.

13:42.602 --> 13:44.770
That's one way to put it.

13:44.804 --> 13:46.839
It's apt.
Blunt force everywhere.

13:46.873 --> 13:48.574
And the skeletal remains
of the other ones

13:48.608 --> 13:50.509
look like they show
signs of fractures as well.

13:50.543 --> 13:53.045
<i>I correlated</i>
<i>my own database</i>

13:53.079 --> 13:55.548
with pan-European
missing people reports

13:55.582 --> 13:56.782
and bodies found

13:56.816 --> 13:58.083
along the route
of the discovery site.

13:58.118 --> 13:59.552
So far, at least 29 cases

13:59.586 --> 14:01.554
<i>in the last decade</i>
<i>bear similarities.</i>

14:01.588 --> 14:02.988
29?

14:03.023 --> 14:04.690
So, they...

14:04.724 --> 14:06.125
Pick up someone
in the Czech Republic,

14:06.159 --> 14:07.693
kill them in Poland,

14:07.727 --> 14:08.861
and dump the body in Germany?

14:08.895 --> 14:09.995
That's pretty wicked, huh?

14:10.030 --> 14:11.664
<i>Cross-border,</i>
<i>and ongoing.</i>

14:11.698 --> 14:12.731
Sebastian,

14:12.766 --> 14:15.501
tell the local police
to send DNA samples

14:15.535 --> 14:17.403
<i>to the major</i>
<i>European authorities.</i>

14:17.437 --> 14:19.772
<i>If we're lucky,</i>
<i>we will be able to start</i>

14:19.806 --> 14:20.940
victim identification.

14:20.974 --> 14:22.007
On it.

14:22.042 --> 14:24.143
Tommy and Eva, let me know
when you've seen

14:24.177 --> 14:25.644
<i>the car in Poland.</i>

14:25.679 --> 14:26.645
Yes, sir. Okay.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.681
You're already looking for me?

14:31.885 --> 14:32.751
What is that?

14:32.786 --> 14:35.421
A dumping ground...
outside Berlin.

14:35.455 --> 14:37.556
My God...

14:40.060 --> 14:40.993
That image...

14:41.027 --> 14:42.828
The victims appear to be

14:42.862 --> 14:44.463
from Germany,

14:44.497 --> 14:45.664
the Czech Republic

14:45.699 --> 14:46.665
and Poland.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.067
Do you have the time

14:48.101 --> 14:50.536
to go before the court?

14:50.570 --> 14:52.538
For that?

14:52.572 --> 14:53.939
Yes.

14:56.243 --> 14:57.209
Sebastian...

14:57.244 --> 14:59.445
What's that?

14:59.479 --> 15:00.212
Right there.

15:01.681 --> 15:03.048
Yeah.

15:03.083 --> 15:06.619
Looks like there is something
under where the first body was.

15:06.653 --> 15:08.487
- Kathrin?
- Yeah?

15:14.527 --> 15:15.461
- Right down there.
- Yeah.

15:15.495 --> 15:17.062
- See it?
- Yeah.

15:20.834 --> 15:21.700
Couldn't have been there long.

15:21.735 --> 15:23.636
It would have decomposed fast.

15:23.670 --> 15:25.504
It's from a road-side diner.

15:27.207 --> 15:28.974
That's just
20 kilometers from here.

15:29.009 --> 15:30.075
Kind of odd, isn't it?

15:30.110 --> 15:33.946
DNA on the body,
matchbooks in the grave.

15:33.980 --> 15:35.548
Outside of burying her,
whoever dumped her

15:35.582 --> 15:37.016
didn't much care
about evidence.

15:37.050 --> 15:39.018
No.

15:44.658 --> 15:45.991
Waitress barely remembers her.

15:46.026 --> 15:47.693
Apparently, they get
a lot of young girls

15:47.727 --> 15:48.694
with clown hair.

15:48.728 --> 15:50.162
I forgot about your jokes.

15:50.931 --> 15:52.598
Sebastian, surveillance camera.

15:52.632 --> 15:54.133
Can you access that?

15:55.735 --> 15:57.202
What's the interest of the ICC

15:57.237 --> 16:00.005
in an abandoned vehicle
in Poland?

16:02.840 --> 16:04.166
Coolant.

16:06.112 --> 16:07.680
Excuse me?

16:11.651 --> 16:12.618
What is he...

16:12.652 --> 16:13.886
Hang on, just...

16:13.920 --> 16:16.789
There's a puncture
in the radiator hose.

16:16.823 --> 16:17.690
Too big,

16:17.724 --> 16:19.191
too clean to be natural.

16:19.226 --> 16:20.659
That's man-made.

16:20.694 --> 16:21.994
You drive a while,

16:22.028 --> 16:23.562
the engine overheats, and...

16:23.597 --> 16:25.998
Kaputt, as our German would say.

16:26.032 --> 16:28.934
These V6 TDIs
would probably make...

16:28.969 --> 16:30.135
40 kilometers, max.

16:30.170 --> 16:32.071
Yeah.

16:32.105 --> 16:32.871
Let's see.

16:34.808 --> 16:36.876
40 kilometers radius...

16:36.910 --> 16:38.911
Nothing...

16:38.945 --> 16:41.046
Here.

16:41.081 --> 16:43.349
Yeah, looks like a rest stop.

16:47.087 --> 16:48.020
Waitress says

16:48.054 --> 16:50.155
the girl was inside
around sunset.

16:50.190 --> 16:52.958
So what, around 5:00 P.M.?

16:54.861 --> 16:56.762
Hello, Red.

16:56.796 --> 16:58.197
He seems interested.

16:58.231 --> 17:01.767
Uh-oh, wifey ain't having that.

17:01.801 --> 17:03.369
Good for her.

17:10.042 --> 17:11.944
Look.

17:11.978 --> 17:14.280
It's the abandoned car
they found in Poland.

17:17.951 --> 17:19.685
Looks familiar.

17:21.387 --> 17:24.056
That is a very
distinctive-looking tattoo

17:24.089 --> 17:25.391
on his right arm.

17:26.826 --> 17:31.096
I'll get a picture
of it out on the wire.

17:31.131 --> 17:33.232
I can't read
the sports car plate.

17:35.135 --> 17:36.969
Here we go.

17:43.243 --> 17:44.777
All right,
Sven and Sandra Liebig.

17:44.811 --> 17:47.313
We can ask
if they saw anything.

17:47.347 --> 17:48.814
Berlin.

17:48.849 --> 17:50.950
Home.

17:51.952 --> 17:52.985
Let's hope they're home.

17:53.019 --> 17:54.253
Looked like they were
going on vacation.

17:54.287 --> 17:55.387
If they're here,

17:55.422 --> 17:57.256
it'd be a good idea
to separate them.

17:57.290 --> 18:01.060
No sense having them influence
each other's memory.

18:01.094 --> 18:03.629
You're going to
handle this, right?

18:03.663 --> 18:04.964
No.

18:04.998 --> 18:06.298
They're just witnesses.

18:06.333 --> 18:07.366
They'll feel
far more comfortable

18:07.400 --> 18:08.901
talking to German officers.

18:08.935 --> 18:10.369
He's right.

18:10.403 --> 18:11.737
I'll take the wife.

18:27.187 --> 18:28.787
You refused this girl a ride.

18:28.822 --> 18:30.823
Refused?

18:30.857 --> 18:32.791
What do you mean by that?

18:32.826 --> 18:34.293
Well, you didn't
give her a ride.

18:34.327 --> 18:36.262
Are you saying it is my fault?

18:36.296 --> 18:38.697
No, I was just...

18:38.732 --> 18:40.199
I saw it on the
security camera.

18:40.233 --> 18:41.200
You told her no.

18:41.234 --> 18:43.202
Her name was Ivonne.

18:43.236 --> 18:45.104
And I wanted to, but my wife...

18:45.138 --> 18:47.273
I said she couldn't
ride with us.

18:47.307 --> 18:49.708
I mean, we're going to
pick up a stranger

18:49.743 --> 18:51.010
in the middle of nowhere?

18:51.044 --> 18:53.145
I wouldn't think so.

18:53.180 --> 18:55.681
Not only was this a stranger,
we had Lara with us.

18:55.715 --> 18:56.815
Our baby.

18:56.850 --> 18:58.817
Of course.
That's smart.

18:58.852 --> 19:02.321
Well, Sven seemed to have
a problem with my saying no.

19:02.355 --> 19:03.689
We had a fight.

19:03.723 --> 19:04.823
Who?

19:04.858 --> 19:05.958
You and the girl?

19:05.992 --> 19:08.060
Why would I fight
with the girl?

19:08.094 --> 19:09.895
I just wanted to know
what you meant.

19:09.930 --> 19:12.097
- My wife and I...
- We had a fight.

19:12.132 --> 19:13.699
Was it physical?

19:13.733 --> 19:14.800
Oh.

19:14.834 --> 19:16.869
Oh, of course not.
No, no.

19:16.903 --> 19:18.103
This was from...

19:20.473 --> 19:22.841
I fell. Skiing.

19:22.876 --> 19:25.077
I fell, skiing.

19:25.111 --> 19:27.379
We were on a skiing holiday,

19:27.414 --> 19:29.281
and that's the only reason
we were out there.

19:29.316 --> 19:30.416
Okay, okay.

19:30.450 --> 19:32.851
Let's just get back
to the fight.

19:32.886 --> 19:34.286
What was it about?

19:34.321 --> 19:35.788
What married couples
fight about.

19:35.822 --> 19:37.990
I'm single.
Enlighten me.

19:38.024 --> 19:39.258
It was about...

19:39.292 --> 19:40.726
The girl, Ivonne.

19:40.760 --> 19:41.760
What about her?

19:41.795 --> 19:43.996
My wife, she got jealous.

19:44.030 --> 19:45.831
Because you flirted with her?

19:45.866 --> 19:47.800
He definitely flirted with her.

19:47.834 --> 19:50.336
So that's why
you refused her a ride?

19:50.370 --> 19:52.104
We were crammed as it was.

19:52.138 --> 19:54.340
There was plenty of room.

19:54.374 --> 19:55.875
But your wife got jealous.

19:55.909 --> 19:57.142
It wouldn't have
mattered anyway.

19:57.177 --> 19:58.344
What do you mean?

19:58.378 --> 19:59.812
We broke down ourselves.

19:59.846 --> 20:00.779
You broke down?

20:00.814 --> 20:01.747
We were dead on the road.

20:01.781 --> 20:03.816
Your car broke down?

20:03.850 --> 20:06.118
And she was picked up
by this guy in a black audi.

20:06.152 --> 20:08.053
They passed us

20:08.088 --> 20:10.389
just, you know,
broken down there.

20:10.423 --> 20:12.958
She wouldn't even offer
to call us a breakdown service.

20:12.993 --> 20:14.360
You sound angry.

20:14.394 --> 20:16.095
Well, damn right, I was angry.

20:16.129 --> 20:17.529
I mean, how can you
leave people

20:17.564 --> 20:18.964
stranded like this?

20:18.999 --> 20:21.066
And now you show up here,
and you start accusing...

20:21.101 --> 20:22.434
I haven't
accused you of anything.

20:22.469 --> 20:24.069
Well, then
you sound accusatory.

20:24.104 --> 20:25.137
I didn't mean to.

20:25.171 --> 20:27.072
Well, even if I did
do something to her,

20:27.107 --> 20:29.074
it would be within my rights.

20:29.109 --> 20:30.876
Sir, is there something
you're not telling me?

20:40.554 --> 20:42.488
Do you have any idea how your...

20:42.522 --> 20:44.990
DNA got on her body?

20:57.304 --> 20:59.505
I...

21:01.323 --> 21:02.841
I killed her.

21:16.202 --> 21:18.424
Make sure he doesn't see
that we took the wife in first.

21:18.544 --> 21:19.637
I told transport.

21:19.757 --> 21:21.018
They've been advised
of their rights,

21:21.138 --> 21:22.037
and no one is to question them

21:22.157 --> 21:23.441
until we get
back to the barracks.

21:23.561 --> 21:25.321
I still can't believe this.

21:25.355 --> 21:26.489
I don't believe this.

21:26.523 --> 21:28.491
Well, you're the one
who sent the text message

21:28.525 --> 21:29.592
about the DNA.

21:29.627 --> 21:31.038
Well, clearly,
they were hiding something.

21:31.195 --> 21:32.996
Well, it worked,
they confessed.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.698
I know. I know.

21:34.732 --> 21:36.599
What, are you saying
they're not the type?

21:36.634 --> 21:38.168
The type?

21:38.202 --> 21:40.036
Fred and Rosemary West
in the U.K.?

21:40.071 --> 21:41.738
The Gallegos in California?
The Copelands?

21:41.772 --> 21:43.740
Homolka and Bernardo?

21:43.774 --> 21:44.841
There are plenty of examples

21:44.875 --> 21:46.076
of couples
committing serial crimes.

21:46.110 --> 21:48.011
They could definitely
be the type.

21:48.045 --> 21:50.367
Yeah... then what doesn't
make sense?

21:50.665 --> 21:53.541
The other couples didn't take
a five-year-old with them.

21:53.661 --> 21:54.801
They confessed.

21:54.835 --> 21:55.935
They break down.

21:55.969 --> 21:57.603
The wife, already pissed
at the hot hitchhiker,

21:57.638 --> 21:59.105
sees her again,

21:59.139 --> 22:00.840
and they beat her to death
and conveniently dump her

22:00.874 --> 22:02.675
where there are six other bodies
laying in the ground?

22:02.709 --> 22:03.743
What happened to
our sports car guy?

22:03.777 --> 22:05.678
Where the hell did he go?

22:05.712 --> 22:07.747
Huh, Mr. Tattoo?
He's not with the car.

22:09.116 --> 22:10.516
But they said, "We did it."

22:10.551 --> 22:11.517
Actually,

22:11.552 --> 22:13.586
that's not what my guy said.

22:13.620 --> 22:14.454
He said, "I killed her."

22:15.556 --> 22:16.622
She said "I" as well.

22:16.657 --> 22:20.259
See? It's like
they're protecting someone.

22:20.294 --> 22:22.295
Here comes child services.

22:30.170 --> 22:32.738
Because of the daughter.

22:32.858 --> 22:34.546
Hello?

22:38.579 --> 22:39.879
Is anybody here?

22:39.913 --> 22:40.847
Hi there.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.482
What can I do for you?

22:42.516 --> 22:44.117
Hi. We are
from the ICC.

22:44.151 --> 22:46.252
I'm Sergeant Vittoria.
He is Tommy McConnel.

22:47.021 --> 22:49.423
We are investigating
this vehicle.

22:49.457 --> 22:50.724
This car stopped here
a few days ago.

22:50.758 --> 22:51.725
Maybe you noticed it?

22:51.759 --> 22:53.460
Sorry.

22:53.494 --> 22:55.796
Well, the driver
had a tattoo on his arm?

22:55.830 --> 22:57.564
I don't think so.

22:57.598 --> 22:59.132
Show him the other one.

22:59.167 --> 23:01.768
The estate car.

23:01.803 --> 23:02.803
What about this one?

23:04.839 --> 23:06.173
Yeah, that one I remember.

23:06.207 --> 23:07.941
Do you?

23:07.975 --> 23:10.043
I serviced it.
They filled up.

23:10.078 --> 23:12.179
You must check a lot of cars.

23:12.213 --> 23:13.480
Why do you remember that one?

23:13.514 --> 23:15.549
The police called me out
to the highway the next morning

23:15.583 --> 23:17.818
because they broke down.

23:17.852 --> 23:19.786
Their radiator line
was punctured.

23:19.821 --> 23:21.054
Yeah?
You didn't notice that

23:21.089 --> 23:21.922
on your check-up?

23:21.956 --> 23:22.923
It wasn't that way then.

23:22.957 --> 23:23.924
You sure?

23:23.958 --> 23:26.126
I checked.
I would have seen it.

23:26.160 --> 23:28.095
It was all a-okay.

23:28.129 --> 23:31.531
They did stop at
the restaurant after, though.

23:31.566 --> 23:34.167
Maybe someone did it
while they were inside.

23:34.202 --> 23:35.535
Well, thank you, then.

23:35.570 --> 23:36.903
You're welcome.

23:36.938 --> 23:38.205
Bye-bye.

23:38.239 --> 23:39.906
<i>Where did</i>
<i>child services take the girl?</i>

23:39.941 --> 23:41.842
I believe they are
in her bedroom, sir.

23:41.876 --> 23:43.577
Yeah, I'll get back to you.

23:43.611 --> 23:44.578
Tommy just called

23:44.612 --> 23:45.946
from the same rest stop
where we were.

23:45.980 --> 23:47.581
Says the sports car's
radiator hose

23:47.615 --> 23:49.116
was sabotaged.

23:49.150 --> 23:50.817
The estate car apparently
had the same problem,

23:50.852 --> 23:52.919
but the garage
fixed it the next day.

23:52.954 --> 23:55.689
Two cars, two punctured
radiator hoses.

23:55.723 --> 23:57.724
Do we think
the Liebigs did that, too?

24:00.761 --> 24:02.129
Yeah, Major Daniel.

24:02.163 --> 24:03.530
Yes, uh,

24:03.564 --> 24:06.767
my name is Detective Vomacka
of the Czech Police.

24:06.801 --> 24:07.934
Yes, sir?

24:07.969 --> 24:09.269
<i>Your agency put out a bulletin</i>

24:09.303 --> 24:13.240
on a man with a distinctive
tattoo on his right arm?

24:13.274 --> 24:14.508
Oh, yeah.

24:14.542 --> 24:15.842
Did you find him?

24:15.877 --> 24:17.611
Mm.

24:19.614 --> 24:22.115
Sort of.

24:31.144 --> 24:32.140
Lara?

24:32.260 --> 24:33.860
My name is Kathrin.

24:33.895 --> 24:35.996
You must be very scared
right now, hmm?

24:36.030 --> 24:36.997
No?

24:37.031 --> 24:38.298
Well, that's good.

24:38.332 --> 24:41.034
Very good.

24:41.068 --> 24:42.869
You went on holiday
with mama and papa

24:42.904 --> 24:45.605
a few days ago, right?

24:45.640 --> 24:48.341
Did you go skiing
in the mountains?

24:50.611 --> 24:53.280
Did you come home
before you got to go skiing?

24:54.582 --> 24:55.682
Oh...

24:55.717 --> 24:57.184
Did something happen?

24:58.619 --> 25:00.053
What happened?

25:02.290 --> 25:04.057
You don't know?

25:07.595 --> 25:08.962
Do you know
what happened, Lara?

25:08.996 --> 25:10.330
Did mama and papa hurt someone?

25:10.365 --> 25:12.132
I think that will be all.

25:12.166 --> 25:15.101
- But I'm only...
- I'm sorry.

25:15.136 --> 25:17.938
The child has been
through enough trauma.

25:17.972 --> 25:20.907
Excuse me,
may I ask one question,

25:20.942 --> 25:22.776
not related to the parents?

25:22.810 --> 25:24.010
Just one. Please?

25:24.045 --> 25:25.946
Okay. One.

25:25.980 --> 25:27.180
Thank you.

25:32.387 --> 25:34.654
Look at this!

25:37.291 --> 25:38.959
Did you draw that?

25:38.993 --> 25:40.761
What is that?

25:42.997 --> 25:44.664
Monsters.

25:48.336 --> 25:50.003
Monsters.

25:56.010 --> 25:57.344
What is it?

26:00.181 --> 26:02.015
It's a truck.

26:13.170 --> 26:14.657
Sandra?

26:15.583 --> 26:17.017
Why is she here?

26:17.052 --> 26:18.318
And why is she handcuffed?

26:18.353 --> 26:19.753
Where's Lara?

26:19.788 --> 26:22.189
You see, normally, I'd want you
both as far apart as possible.

26:22.223 --> 26:24.691
Let you both sweat
what the other is telling me.

26:24.726 --> 26:27.161
But this...

26:27.195 --> 26:28.729
This feels like the opposite,

26:28.763 --> 26:32.533
like if you know
that you both confessed,

26:32.567 --> 26:34.535
then there's nobody left
to take care of your daughter.

26:34.569 --> 26:35.703
That's what this feels like.

26:35.737 --> 26:37.104
You confessed?

26:37.138 --> 26:39.706
I had to.

26:39.741 --> 26:41.642
They told me
my DNA was on the girl.

26:43.044 --> 26:44.378
They told me the same thing.

26:44.412 --> 26:47.080
Which may even turn out
to be true.

26:47.115 --> 26:48.615
They haven't tested
the fluids on her body yet.

26:49.717 --> 26:50.717
It was a lie?

26:50.752 --> 26:52.720
No more than your confessions.

26:52.754 --> 26:55.456
The fact
that you both believed it

26:55.490 --> 26:58.525
tells me that you think
it's a possibility.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.027
I don't care what she said.

27:00.061 --> 27:01.128
I killed that girl.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.129
You should let her go

27:02.163 --> 27:03.630
so she can take care
of our Lara...

27:03.665 --> 27:06.700
That's what I'm talking about.

27:06.734 --> 27:07.634
This is all about Lara.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.670
It's about your
daughter, isn't it?

27:09.704 --> 27:11.605
Lara is being
well taken care of

27:11.639 --> 27:14.708
by a very professional
child services worker.

27:14.742 --> 27:17.211
She's having a much better time

27:17.245 --> 27:19.046
than any of us are.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.749
Why...

27:23.585 --> 27:25.285
Does she see trucks as monsters?

27:33.178 --> 27:36.063
We... we didn't
have any choice.

27:39.434 --> 27:41.435
They said if
we didn't fight them,

27:41.469 --> 27:43.504
they'd kill us.

27:46.741 --> 27:50.811
And then if we told,
they would kill her.

27:50.845 --> 27:53.747
They'd kill our baby.

28:02.223 --> 28:03.490
Have you ever
stopped to notice to see

28:03.525 --> 28:05.492
how many of them there are?

28:05.527 --> 28:06.527
They're everywhere.

28:08.163 --> 28:09.196
You brought us in.

28:09.230 --> 28:11.331
I'm sure they saw.
You have to protect her.

28:11.366 --> 28:12.766
You have to protect
my daughter from them.

28:12.801 --> 28:14.501
Them?

28:17.505 --> 28:18.639
<i>Truckers.</i>

28:18.673 --> 28:20.707
They took them to
an abandoned tarmac somewhere,

28:20.742 --> 28:22.476
and they made
the two couples fight.

28:22.510 --> 28:23.310
Fight?

28:23.344 --> 28:25.379
To the death.

28:25.413 --> 28:27.214
Did we miss anything?

28:27.248 --> 28:29.283
Long-haul truck drivers,

28:29.317 --> 28:30.684
hunting people like a game.

28:30.718 --> 28:32.453
That's what we're dealing with.

28:32.487 --> 28:33.587
Predators.

28:33.621 --> 28:35.289
The FBI established

28:35.323 --> 28:37.691
a highway serial killer
database in the U.S.

28:37.725 --> 28:40.260
Over 500 suspected
serial slayings.

28:40.295 --> 28:41.628
All by truck drivers?

28:41.663 --> 28:42.763
European open borders.

28:42.797 --> 28:44.631
Long-haulers
moving from country to country

28:44.666 --> 28:46.667
in a matter of hours.
Why not?

28:46.701 --> 28:49.169
Using the flow of the highway
as a smoke screen,

28:49.204 --> 28:51.338
dumping the bodies
hundreds of Miles apart.

28:51.373 --> 28:52.673
The couple we brought in

28:52.707 --> 28:53.841
said they were threatened,

28:53.875 --> 28:57.678
said that their daughter
would be found and killed

28:57.712 --> 28:59.413
if they contacted
the authorities.

28:59.447 --> 29:01.281
Both cars were sabotaged?

29:01.316 --> 29:03.250
Radiator hoses punctured.

29:03.284 --> 29:04.351
Tractor-trailers
come to the rescue,

29:04.386 --> 29:05.652
offer them a ride,

29:05.687 --> 29:07.588
then they find themselves
in some kind of a holding cell

29:07.622 --> 29:09.223
in the trailer,
taken to an empty area,

29:09.257 --> 29:11.625
where they have to fight
for their lives...

29:11.660 --> 29:13.827
Against another couple.

29:13.862 --> 29:17.264
A fight club, where someone else
takes all the punishment.

29:17.298 --> 29:18.632
Probably had
a betting line, too.

29:18.666 --> 29:20.434
They let the winners go.

29:20.468 --> 29:21.835
Yeah, to remember
the rest of their lives

29:21.870 --> 29:23.670
that they murdered someone.

29:23.705 --> 29:25.506
Why were they allowed
to survive?

29:25.540 --> 29:27.207
Winner takes all?

29:27.242 --> 29:28.609
They proved worthy?

29:28.643 --> 29:29.843
They leave witnesses
every time?

29:29.878 --> 29:31.278
Risky.

29:31.312 --> 29:32.312
But how risky is it, really?

29:32.347 --> 29:34.281
They've participated
in killing someone.

29:34.315 --> 29:35.716
The truckers probably
kept evidence,

29:35.750 --> 29:38.285
photos, videos, even.

29:38.319 --> 29:39.887
And they threatened
the life of a child.

29:41.389 --> 29:43.424
Maybe that's
what they're looking for.

29:43.458 --> 29:45.726
Huh? People with kids?

29:47.295 --> 29:49.663
Louis, I'm leaving!

29:51.966 --> 29:54.501
Louis?

30:39.013 --> 30:41.915
Right there,
enhance that car.

30:43.051 --> 30:44.385
He had a kid with him, too.

30:48.356 --> 30:49.857
A little boy.

30:49.891 --> 30:51.558
Where is he now?

30:51.593 --> 30:52.660
Sebastian?

30:52.694 --> 30:54.528
How much of that footage
do you have archived?

30:54.562 --> 30:57.464
A lot. Why?

30:57.499 --> 30:58.766
Because this family
went missing yesterday

30:58.800 --> 31:01.902
in their v.W.

31:22.390 --> 31:23.991
Don't move.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.706
Where are they?

31:29.113 --> 31:30.423
How would I know?

31:30.543 --> 31:32.141
Three cars,
three missing families.

31:32.261 --> 31:34.017
They all have
one thing in common!

31:34.137 --> 31:34.810
You.

31:34.930 --> 31:36.654
I found this hidden
in the office.

31:45.957 --> 31:47.321
So you sabotage the engine.

31:47.441 --> 31:49.070
Then what?

31:49.995 --> 31:51.362
I give them a call
on the C.B.

31:51.396 --> 31:52.964
You know what they're
doing with the people?

31:52.998 --> 31:54.132
Don't wanna know.

31:54.166 --> 31:55.967
Yeah, as long as
you're getting paid, right?

31:56.001 --> 31:57.168
You wouldn't understand.

31:57.202 --> 31:58.402
Where are they?

32:01.373 --> 32:02.540
No idea.

32:02.574 --> 32:04.075
Anything happens to them,

32:04.109 --> 32:05.576
it's going to be laid
right at your feet.

32:05.611 --> 32:07.445
All I did was call it in.

32:08.947 --> 32:11.282
You tell that to a judge.

32:13.418 --> 32:14.919
They just drive them around

32:14.953 --> 32:15.953
until...

32:15.988 --> 32:16.821
Until they get a match.

32:16.855 --> 32:18.155
Someone for them to fight.

32:18.190 --> 32:19.123
Yeah, another couple.

32:19.158 --> 32:20.625
They get a match, right?

32:23.395 --> 32:25.229
Undercover decoy.

32:27.065 --> 32:29.367
I'm in.

32:29.401 --> 32:32.303
Aye. No worries.

32:32.337 --> 32:34.172
Okay.

32:34.206 --> 32:35.239
We do have a problem, don't we?

32:35.274 --> 32:36.607
- We need a kid.
- Yeah.

32:36.642 --> 32:39.043
That's the beauty
of your scam, huh?

32:39.077 --> 32:40.478
They wouldn't pick up
anyone without kids,

32:40.512 --> 32:43.648
and cops would not be
undercover with one.

32:45.450 --> 32:46.617
I have a son.

32:48.520 --> 32:49.220
You do?

32:49.254 --> 32:51.189
He's five.

32:51.223 --> 32:53.257
We're not going to risk
an actual child.

32:53.292 --> 32:55.226
No, wait, hear me out.

32:55.260 --> 32:56.894
They only need to see him,

32:56.929 --> 32:58.596
right?

33:01.400 --> 33:03.034
Radio check, one, two.
One, two.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.368
<i>Affirmative, Tommy.</i>

33:04.403 --> 33:05.436
<i>We read you.</i>

33:09.408 --> 33:10.341
Hi.

33:10.375 --> 33:12.109
Hi.

33:14.012 --> 33:15.112
Erik,

33:15.147 --> 33:17.982
these are the two police
friends I told you about.

33:18.016 --> 33:19.450
Hi.

33:19.485 --> 33:20.585
Hi. Nice to meet you.
I'm eva.

33:20.619 --> 33:22.987
I'm Erik.

33:23.021 --> 33:23.888
He's Tommy.

33:23.922 --> 33:24.889
Hi.

33:24.923 --> 33:26.124
Hi.

33:26.158 --> 33:27.892
Remember, just do what
the officers tell you, yeah?

33:27.926 --> 33:29.360
Mommy will be watching.

33:29.394 --> 33:30.661
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:31.964 --> 33:32.997
He'll be okay.

33:36.034 --> 33:37.602
Okay, we're going to stay here.

33:37.636 --> 33:39.170
All right, we're good to go.

33:39.204 --> 33:41.305
Go ahead and make
the broadcast.

33:41.340 --> 33:44.442
Black mamba for great white.

33:44.476 --> 33:46.511
<i>Great white. Go ahead.</i>

33:46.545 --> 33:48.679
Got a hunting report.

33:53.652 --> 33:55.052
- It's on.
- Okay.

33:56.221 --> 33:59.423
- You okay? Yes?
- Yes.

33:59.458 --> 34:00.625
I think we got something.

34:04.530 --> 34:06.230
All right, heads up,
it's a truck.

34:06.265 --> 34:07.231
Two of them.

34:07.266 --> 34:09.167
Correction, two trucks.

34:09.201 --> 34:12.003
Two trucks.
We're on.

34:14.005 --> 34:15.706
Are you going to be
a police officer

34:15.741 --> 34:17.375
like your mom when you grow up?

34:17.409 --> 34:18.242
Yes.

34:18.277 --> 34:21.512
Yes? Good boy.

34:34.493 --> 34:37.261
Hey.
We've got engine trouble, mate.

34:37.295 --> 34:38.728
Can you give us a hand?

34:39.630 --> 34:42.266
Okay, now we go in the car.

34:42.301 --> 34:43.668
We warm up in the car.

34:45.237 --> 34:47.705
There we go.
He's here.

34:47.739 --> 34:50.141
Erik.
Erik, come here.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.310
<i>It can't be fixed?</i>

34:53.478 --> 34:55.746
You okay?

34:55.781 --> 34:57.448
All right, then, yeah,
we'd love a lift.

34:57.483 --> 34:58.349
Thank you.

34:58.383 --> 35:00.251
Are you sure?

35:00.285 --> 35:01.319
It's either that

35:01.353 --> 35:04.222
or stand out in the
freezing cold all night.

35:04.256 --> 35:06.491
Okay. I'll get Erik.

35:06.525 --> 35:08.192
Okay.

35:08.227 --> 35:11.028
She's just going
to get the boy.

35:11.063 --> 35:12.330
Is he all right?

35:12.364 --> 35:13.297
Yeah.

35:13.332 --> 35:14.532
Hi.

35:14.566 --> 35:15.533
Give it to me.

35:15.567 --> 35:16.334
Be careful.

35:16.368 --> 35:17.769
Yeah, if I was careful,

35:17.803 --> 35:19.570
I would have just lived off
my father's money.

35:21.640 --> 35:24.142
Looks like they took the bait.

35:33.619 --> 35:35.420
All right, here we go.
Soft tail.

35:35.454 --> 35:37.488
Remember, leap frog
as much as possible.

35:37.523 --> 35:39.590
No one moves until
you get our call.

35:39.625 --> 35:43.060
We wait until we get visual
of the other missing family.

35:43.095 --> 35:44.595
Let's go.

35:52.838 --> 35:54.705
Where is the boy?

35:54.740 --> 35:56.441
With a uniform.

35:56.475 --> 35:58.509
He's handsome.

36:00.078 --> 36:01.212
I guess so.

36:01.246 --> 36:02.146
You want to talk about it?

36:02.181 --> 36:03.181
No.

36:06.485 --> 36:08.119
I think if we were
an average couple,

36:08.153 --> 36:09.787
we would know by now
we were in trouble?

36:09.822 --> 36:11.155
If we were an average couple,

36:11.190 --> 36:13.758
we would have been in trouble
a long time ago.

36:20.399 --> 36:21.632
Off the highway.
They've stopped.

36:24.503 --> 36:26.371
Let's go!

36:26.405 --> 36:27.772
Go?

36:27.806 --> 36:29.774
Get down.

36:29.808 --> 36:31.409
Our son is asleep.

36:31.443 --> 36:32.543
Leave him.

36:35.447 --> 36:36.681
Come on! Get off!

36:36.715 --> 36:39.784
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on, get down from there!

36:45.791 --> 36:47.658
Come on!

36:47.693 --> 36:52.597
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

36:52.631 --> 36:55.466
Fight! Fight! Fight!

36:58.401 --> 37:01.732
- Fight! Fight!
- Fight who?!

37:01.852 --> 37:03.789
<i>There's no one else here!</i>

37:03.823 --> 37:04.990
No one move in yet.

37:05.024 --> 37:06.558
He doesn't see
the other family.

37:06.592 --> 37:07.926
All units, hold.

37:10.363 --> 37:13.031
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

37:13.066 --> 37:14.666
Back to back, Tommy.

37:14.701 --> 37:15.934
How many are there?

37:15.969 --> 37:17.603
Too many.

37:17.637 --> 37:19.905
Fight! Fight!

37:19.939 --> 37:20.939
There's at least
a dozen trucks,

37:20.974 --> 37:22.274
but still no family.

37:22.308 --> 37:24.209
<i>I'm guessing there's</i>
<i>about 20 fellows here.</i>

37:24.243 --> 37:27.145
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

37:27.180 --> 37:28.113
They're there.

37:28.147 --> 37:29.948
Move in. Move in.

37:32.986 --> 37:35.153
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

37:38.358 --> 37:40.292
One long rifle, high,
South-southeast.

37:41.327 --> 37:42.761
All right, you follow me.
You do what I do.

37:42.795 --> 37:43.929
Okay.

37:43.963 --> 37:48.934
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

37:50.770 --> 37:51.970
Come on, attack!

37:52.005 --> 37:53.005
That's your plan?

37:53.039 --> 37:54.106
All right, come on,
or they'll kill us!

37:55.108 --> 37:56.008
All right, come on!

37:56.042 --> 37:57.175
Come over here!

37:57.210 --> 37:58.977
Come on!

38:00.813 --> 38:01.813
Sebastian?

38:01.848 --> 38:02.881
Sir?

38:02.915 --> 38:03.915
Are you wearing your seat belt?

38:03.950 --> 38:04.917
Excuse me?

38:09.389 --> 38:10.889
I won't hurt you.

38:10.924 --> 38:12.090
I'm a cop.

38:12.125 --> 38:13.759
Just follow what I say, okay?

38:22.101 --> 38:24.102
Hit me!

38:26.072 --> 38:27.739
Just put me on the floor.

38:27.774 --> 38:29.241
On the floor.

38:42.155 --> 38:43.255
Freeze! Police!

39:02.208 --> 39:04.042
You okay?

39:07.180 --> 39:09.181
We're fine.

39:21.494 --> 39:22.694
<i>Three cars,</i>

39:22.729 --> 39:25.097
<i>three missing families.</i>

39:25.131 --> 39:27.232
<i>They all have</i>
<i>one thing in common.</i>

39:41.548 --> 39:43.049
We brought your
wife in for questioning.

39:44.451 --> 39:46.519
She never did anything
but raise those children.

39:46.553 --> 39:48.988
She didn't ask
where they were coming from?

39:49.022 --> 39:53.626
If the parents
weren't able to fight for them,

39:53.660 --> 39:56.662
they didn't deserve their kids.

39:56.697 --> 39:58.998
Who did you have to fight?

40:00.968 --> 40:01.667
I told you.

40:01.702 --> 40:03.202
You wouldn't understand.

40:03.237 --> 40:04.070
Yeah, a dozen truckers

40:04.104 --> 40:05.204
make people fight to the death

40:05.239 --> 40:06.539
for their amusement,

40:06.573 --> 40:08.040
and you steal the losers' kids.

40:08.075 --> 40:09.642
You're right,
I don't understand.

40:11.445 --> 40:12.545
<i>He's fine.</i>
<i>He did real good.</i>

40:12.579 --> 40:14.714
He's a good boy.

40:17.351 --> 40:18.951
It was...

40:18.986 --> 40:20.419
good seeing you again.

40:22.122 --> 40:23.356
Yeah. Very good.

40:25.759 --> 40:27.326
Come on.

40:31.065 --> 40:32.098
So, this all started

40:32.132 --> 40:33.566
because you put
an abandoned car in Poland

40:33.600 --> 40:36.502
together with
a body in Germany.

40:36.537 --> 40:39.439
Well, anyone would have done it
if they had my equipment.

40:39.473 --> 40:41.107
No.

40:41.141 --> 40:43.476
Nobody saw it,
even with your equipment.

40:44.645 --> 40:45.578
I just...

40:45.612 --> 40:47.547
wanted to tell you that.

40:51.685 --> 40:52.618
Said you haven't seen her

40:52.653 --> 40:54.120
in six years?

40:54.154 --> 40:55.521
Yeah, that's right.

40:55.556 --> 40:58.324
Good-looking boy.

40:58.358 --> 41:00.522
How old do you think he is?
About five?

41:01.795 --> 41:04.497
If you're suggesting what
I think you're suggesting...

41:04.531 --> 41:06.199
She would have told me.

41:06.233 --> 41:08.413
Maybe this was
her way of trying.

41:41.131 --> 41:42.661
Let's go,
Sebastian!

41:42.781 --> 41:44.470
The major's buying.
