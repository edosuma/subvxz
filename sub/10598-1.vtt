'.. in downtown Los Angeles
right now. Here with the traffic... '

01:58.484 --> 02:00.360
I've been waiting for 15 minutes.

02:00.402 --> 02:03.196
- Thought you were stuck in traffic?
- You late?

02:03.238 --> 02:05.657
- You got all the paperwork?
- Yeah.

02:05.740 --> 02:08.701
Are you pissed off at me?
I'm just doing my part.

02:08.785 --> 02:11.704
- I know, I know.
- You're my guy, Jerry, my guy.

02:17.876 --> 02:21.088
'Margolese Holdings,
how may I direct your call? '

02:21.129 --> 02:24.049
- Yes, I'll put you through.
- Hey, Estelle.

02:24.049 --> 02:26.301
Is that Nayman's little nephew?

02:26.342 --> 02:29.929
- Yeah, that's Big Tom.
- Big Tom! Sure, it is?

02:30.013 --> 02:33.307
- How's it goin' there, Big Tom?
- Hey, hey. Look.

02:36.727 --> 02:38.937
Shh. See? See?

02:38.979 --> 02:40.772
Why are you scaring the kid?

02:40.814 --> 02:43.859
- I-I was just...
- Did you get that passport?

02:43.942 --> 02:45.610
Yes.

02:47.403 --> 02:49.781
- I have issues.
- Issues, Jerry.

02:49.864 --> 02:53.159
It burns my ass to write you
a check every week.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.286
I can explain what happened.

02:55.369 --> 02:57.663
You say that
when it's once in a while.

02:57.788 --> 03:01.375
- It's every time, Jerry.
- It's every fuckin' time.

03:01.416 --> 03:04.836
And I can certainly
understand that perspective.

03:04.920 --> 03:07.589
But I've been having
some personal problems...

03:07.630 --> 03:10.216
uh, with my life.

03:10.258 --> 03:14.136
My girlfriend, she's a great girl,
but she has complaints.

03:14.220 --> 03:17.389
I don't but, she does.
If you want to know the truth,

03:17.514 --> 03:21.059
I can't even believe this,
but we go to a group.

03:24.229 --> 03:26.606
So... last week,

03:26.689 --> 03:29.984
when you guys told me to pick up
the thing at the thing,

03:30.026 --> 03:33.362
well, Samantha says she needs
the car to pick up some things.

03:33.446 --> 03:38.200
And, I don't have to tell you boys,
I mean, things got heated, right?

03:38.242 --> 03:40.744
And she hid them.

03:40.786 --> 03:42.579
She hid them?

03:47.500 --> 03:50.044
Oh! The keys. She hid them.

03:50.128 --> 03:53.756
She... You know, and I couldn't
get to the thing on time,

03:53.798 --> 03:56.675
and it all got messed up
and I think that maybe...

03:56.800 --> 04:00.512
Maybe some things
aren't meant to happen.

04:01.596 --> 04:03.598
Jerry, you're a fucking moron.

04:05.475 --> 04:09.479
Here are your options. Number one,
I roll you up in a carpet,

04:09.562 --> 04:12.023
stuff you in a Sedan
and set fire to you.

04:12.106 --> 04:15.609
- You with me? Choice one.
- Yeah.

04:15.651 --> 04:18.862
Number two. You like sex and travel?

04:18.987 --> 04:22.365
What, you like to have sex?
You like to travel?

04:22.407 --> 04:26.578
Get on a flight to Mexico. All the
hookers you can shake your stick at.

04:26.703 --> 04:29.080
Pick up a pistol
that belongs to Margolese.

04:29.163 --> 04:32.541
- What's it gonna be?
- OK, I was under the impression

04:32.583 --> 04:36.754
with Margolese getting out of jail,
that the last job was my last job.

04:36.837 --> 04:39.715
- You fucked up that job.
- You fucked it up.

04:39.756 --> 04:41.633
This job will be your last job.

04:41.717 --> 04:43.677
OK, but a trip right now...

04:43.677 --> 04:47.347
He asked for you. Want me to call him
and say you can't go?

04:47.472 --> 04:50.391
Because I'll call. I'd love to.

04:50.433 --> 04:54.270
You're goin' on a fucking trip.
The town's called San Miguel.

04:54.353 --> 04:57.815
You look for a kid in a bar,
the El Alamo.

04:57.898 --> 05:02.736
This is a simple fucking task.
Write it down. Roll up your sleeves.

05:02.861 --> 05:05.363
- Get involved!
- Ow!

05:05.405 --> 05:09.784
The kid's name is Beck. He's got this
particular gun. He's waiting on you.

05:09.867 --> 05:12.328
- Beck.
- When you find him, bring him

05:12.411 --> 05:14.580
and the gun back Stateside, got it?

05:14.705 --> 05:17.624
Last chance, Jerry.
I'm telling you. The last.

05:17.666 --> 05:20.002
Even he's getting tired of your shit.

05:20.043 --> 05:22.045
I'll take care of it, Bernie.

05:22.170 --> 05:25.465
Vaya con Dios, motherfucker.
You're in coach.

05:32.430 --> 05:34.306
Baby, what are you doing?

05:34.348 --> 05:36.433
You said this was your last job!

05:36.600 --> 05:39.353
What do you want me to say?
"Sorry I can't,

05:39.478 --> 05:42.022
"the old lady wants me to quit.
Fuck off. "

05:42.022 --> 05:45.358
Yes! Something like that.
Like exactly!

05:45.442 --> 05:47.360
I'm not in insurance, sweetie!

05:47.485 --> 05:51.614
If you get on that plane, you will
never, never, ever see me again.

05:51.656 --> 05:54.450
You got me?
We talked about this. I told you.

05:54.492 --> 05:57.036
I wanted us to go
to Las Vegas for me.

05:57.161 --> 06:00.372
- Not you, me.
- Baby, you're overreacting. OK?

06:00.414 --> 06:04.626
Don't do that! Don't you do that!
Don't diminish my needs.

06:04.668 --> 06:07.587
Sweetheart, I don't have a choice.
I gotta go.

06:07.629 --> 06:11.132
- I go down there, I come right back.
- "I, I, I, I, I!"

06:11.174 --> 06:14.343
I wonder what the group
would have to say about that.

06:14.427 --> 06:18.389
No. You cannot use that against me!
We are not even married, but I go.

06:18.430 --> 06:20.349
The group thinks we're married.

06:20.390 --> 06:23.810
I accepted the potato slicer
for our anniversary.

06:23.894 --> 06:25.687
Right, sweets? I go along.

06:25.812 --> 06:30.024
That's it. That is it.
You... You... You go along!

06:30.066 --> 06:34.361
You don't want to get married.
And this is the way you deal with it!

06:34.403 --> 06:37.281
Huh? You're back to
the same old selfish,

06:37.406 --> 06:40.325
self-involved, vile, disgusting...

06:40.409 --> 06:42.035
- Oh, God. You are...
- .. self!

06:42.077 --> 06:46.331
You're missing the grand design here!
If I don't go, I'm dead.

06:46.414 --> 06:49.292
Yeah. And it's difficult
to have a relationship

06:49.375 --> 06:51.794
if I'm stuffed with formaldehyde.

06:51.878 --> 06:56.465
- Now, if anyone is being selfish...
- Oh! Now you blame-shift?

06:56.507 --> 06:59.510
- You are blame shifting?
- Stop analyzing!

06:59.593 --> 07:01.136
I'm calling a time-out!

07:02.054 --> 07:03.054
Ah!

07:12.939 --> 07:15.274
All right...

07:15.399 --> 07:18.527
Jerry, I want you to acknowledge...

07:18.652 --> 07:21.697
that my needs mean nothing to you
and you're selfish.

07:21.822 --> 07:24.950
- Oh, my God!
- Jerry, acknowledge.

07:25.033 --> 07:28.161
I... OK.

07:28.286 --> 07:32.957
I will acknowledge that I promised
I would go to Vegas with you.

07:32.999 --> 07:35.417
But now we're just slightly delayed.

07:35.543 --> 07:42.090
If you want to construe my wanting
to stay alive as being selfish, OK.

07:42.174 --> 07:46.928
I have every intention of going with
you. Your needs are important to me.

07:49.055 --> 07:53.351
Come on. Look at all my stuff here,
all over the pavement.

07:53.434 --> 07:56.645
Come on, baby. Huh?

08:00.107 --> 08:02.442
What do you say?

08:02.526 --> 08:04.945
OK?

08:07.405 --> 08:09.824
I'm going with or without you, Jerry.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.453
What's it gonna be?

08:16.622 --> 08:19.500
- A bastard!
- A bastard.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.794
What happened to, uh,
"sweetheart" and "big love"?

08:22.836 --> 08:25.672
All those things
you called me last night?

08:25.672 --> 08:28.675
The only thing I'm interested
in calling you is a cab!

08:58.869 --> 09:02.831
Excuse me, speak English?
Excuse me, you speak English?

09:02.914 --> 09:05.041
What?

09:06.126 --> 09:07.585
All set, Mr. Welbach.

09:07.710 --> 09:11.297
If you go to the front,
a shuttle will take you to your car.

09:11.380 --> 09:14.800
- What kind of car is it?
- It's a Chrysler. Brand-new.

09:14.925 --> 09:16.760
Yeah.

09:16.885 --> 09:18.846
Is there a problem, Mr. Welbach?

09:18.929 --> 09:22.766
You know, it's my first trip
to Mexico and... a Chrysler?

09:22.891 --> 09:25.143
I mean,
I drive a Chrysler in America.

09:25.185 --> 09:29.689
I thought you might have something
more authentic, a little more...

09:29.772 --> 09:33.234
- Mexican?
- You know, get into the spirit?

09:33.317 --> 09:35.444
- Your first time?
- Yeah.

09:35.528 --> 09:36.987
Wow. Exciting.

09:37.071 --> 09:39.406
Do you speak Spanish, Mr. Welbach?

09:39.531 --> 09:41.116
Huh?

09:41.366 --> 09:44.369
I didn't think so. Just
what you learned on Speedy Gonzales?

09:44.411 --> 09:46.287
Yeah, Speedy Gonzales.

09:46.329 --> 09:49.165
Let's see what we can do for you.

09:49.207 --> 09:51.292
Oh, I think I have just the thing.

09:52.335 --> 09:56.130
How would you like... an El Camino?!

09:56.213 --> 09:58.132
Ooh! I like that. Yeah.

09:58.215 --> 10:01.802
You're going to get
into a lot of trouble here, sir.

10:01.927 --> 10:02.886
Raoul!

10:05.889 --> 10:08.224
Who wants him, a two-dayer?

10:09.392 --> 10:11.936
He looks like a lead foot
and a brake rider.

10:12.728 --> 10:15.231
No. At the count of three.

10:15.731 --> 10:18.859
Uno... Dos... Tres...

10:38.252 --> 10:41.963
Yeah, man. El Camino!

10:48.261 --> 10:53.057
# El Camino excellente,
El Camino excellente... #

11:28.756 --> 11:30.049
# El Camino...

11:32.843 --> 11:35.262
# In my El Camino... #

13:04.594 --> 13:06.429
Fucker.

14:05.775 --> 14:07.986
You are in the wrong place, America.

14:08.069 --> 14:10.655
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

14:12.907 --> 14:14.784
What you want here?

14:14.867 --> 14:17.619
Uh... tequila.

14:22.290 --> 14:25.877
I asked because no one like you...

14:26.002 --> 14:28.046
comes to this place.

14:28.129 --> 14:30.131
It's death, this town.

14:31.591 --> 14:34.844
Only farmers... and bandidos.

14:36.971 --> 14:39.598
And I don't see a hoe.

14:41.767 --> 14:43.643
You a bandido, America?

14:45.478 --> 14:49.982
Uh, no. Uh, actually
I'm looking for a Señor Beck.

14:53.402 --> 14:54.987
Señor Beck?

15:02.786 --> 15:04.621
Right.

15:13.838 --> 15:15.005
OK?

15:28.059 --> 15:30.728
You Beck?

15:30.812 --> 15:34.815
- I know who you are.
- Good. That makes things easier.

15:34.899 --> 15:38.694
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:39.987 --> 15:43.573
- We cool?
- You're all the same.

15:43.698 --> 15:45.450
Prepared.

15:47.494 --> 15:49.620
This ain't America. You want a drink?

15:51.747 --> 15:53.874
- Yeah, all right.
- Sit down.

15:57.044 --> 15:58.879
Somebody using this chair?

16:11.516 --> 16:13.392
I guess you wanna see it, right?

16:13.434 --> 16:15.811
- Yeah.
- You want to see it, don't you?

16:15.895 --> 16:18.188
Yeah. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to.

16:24.694 --> 16:26.154
Hey.

16:26.237 --> 16:29.615
You know what? Come with me.

16:34.870 --> 16:36.622
Sorry. Sorry.

16:41.335 --> 16:45.088
This is what they call The Mexican.

16:47.257 --> 16:50.218
Wow. Yeah, that's pretty.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.470
Are you shitting me?
"Yeah, it's pretty. "

16:52.553 --> 16:54.513
- Can I?
- Uh-huh.

16:54.638 --> 16:59.309
It was made for a rich landowner,
a nobleman,

16:59.434 --> 17:01.853
by a poor Mexican gunsmith.

17:01.895 --> 17:05.440
He fashioned this gun as a gift
to go along with the hopes

17:05.482 --> 17:09.777
that the nobleman's son would take
his daughter's hand in marriage.

17:14.824 --> 17:17.910
'The townspeople
waited three months

17:18.035 --> 17:20.746
'to catch the first glimpse
of the pistol.

17:22.914 --> 17:24.624
'Finally, the day had come.

17:24.790 --> 17:28.252
'No one had ever laid eyes
on a more beautiful gun.

17:30.213 --> 17:32.215
'It was all they thought it'd be.

17:32.298 --> 17:36.343
'Some even thought
it was too beautiful to look at.

17:41.431 --> 17:44.601
'It was considered
to be an honor and good luck

17:44.643 --> 17:47.353
'to be the first to fire
a newly fashioned gun.

17:49.522 --> 17:53.984
'Especially one as beautiful as this,
made for the hand of a nobleman.

17:59.865 --> 18:04.452
'The townsman was in a trance
at the gun's flawless craftsmanship.

18:24.888 --> 18:26.973
'It backfired...

18:27.015 --> 18:28.975
'killing him instantly. '

18:41.445 --> 18:45.573
Legend has it
that it's been cursed ever since.

18:45.615 --> 18:50.787
But it hasn't harmed me any though,
you know? I... I love to look at it.

19:02.839 --> 19:06.176
You don't even want to know
what this gun is worth.

19:14.767 --> 19:17.269
We could sell that gun, man.

19:17.269 --> 19:20.981
It's... It's a great fucking gun.

19:21.064 --> 19:24.734
And I'm not just talking shit either.

19:24.776 --> 19:29.322
You don't have to be a... Fuck.

19:29.447 --> 19:32.992
I've been pissin' on myself. Fuck.

19:33.117 --> 19:36.537
Anyway, the old man
is nothing to be afraid of.

19:36.662 --> 19:39.748
As a matter of fact,
last week I told him to fuck off.

19:39.873 --> 19:42.584
- Yeah, you did!
- That's what I said too!

19:42.626 --> 19:46.963
I said, "Fuck off, Margolese,
you old prune shit-ass! If you... "

19:53.844 --> 19:55.804
Come on, fella. Get up. Huh?

19:57.014 --> 20:00.434
Man, you're soaked in your own urine.
Don't make me carry you.

20:00.559 --> 20:02.310
Hey!

20:02.394 --> 20:04.479
Ah, this is my life.

20:08.483 --> 20:10.443
All right.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.950
Yeah, baby. I got the touch.

20:19.076 --> 20:21.578
Oh!

20:21.661 --> 20:23.788
Buddy, you whacked your noggin!

20:24.831 --> 20:26.374
Hey.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.252
Oh, f...

20:30.837 --> 20:32.213
Ooh.

20:37.593 --> 20:38.802
Hey, man. Hey.

20:40.846 --> 20:42.597
Oh, shit!

20:44.224 --> 20:46.059
Oh, shit!

20:57.486 --> 20:59.238
Stop that! Stop!

21:00.280 --> 21:02.115
Christ!

21:05.201 --> 21:07.203
I found the gun.

21:07.245 --> 21:09.205
'The gun is in your possession?'

21:09.330 --> 21:12.250
As we speak.
But, like I said, there's, uh...

21:12.416 --> 21:14.376
There's a problem.

21:14.460 --> 21:17.838
What? You lost the kid? He's a souse,
he'll be in another bar.

21:17.880 --> 21:22.634
The kid's dead, Ted.
Ted, are you hearing me?

21:24.844 --> 21:27.180
Yeah. I-I heard you.

21:28.223 --> 21:29.807
How?

21:29.849 --> 21:32.018
Bad luck, act of God, fuck if I know.

21:32.101 --> 21:35.020
All these maniacs shooting
guns up into the sky.

21:35.104 --> 21:39.066
It's Independence Day or something.
The kid got tagged by a loose one.

21:39.107 --> 21:42.360
Right in the fuckin' head.
I mean... Fu...

21:42.402 --> 21:44.654
He's dead! The kid's dead.

21:44.738 --> 21:48.032
The little fucker's in my car
right now, dead.

21:48.116 --> 21:51.994
Geez, Jerry,
that's not a little problem.

21:52.036 --> 21:54.288
- 'That's a big problem. '
- I know.

21:54.413 --> 21:57.875
Jerry, that little fucker
is Margolese's grandson.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.669
What? What?

22:00.711 --> 22:03.255
'Geez, you really
fucked it this time. '

22:03.338 --> 22:07.217
What did I have to do with it? One
minute he's pissin', next he's dead.

22:07.258 --> 22:08.843
'Don't even move. '

22:08.843 --> 22:10.553
I'll phone the office now.

22:10.636 --> 22:13.472
I'll get me on a plane
and straighten shit out.

22:13.597 --> 22:17.643
Ted, you gotta get word to the old
man. I didn't know who he was.

22:17.768 --> 22:21.396
OK. Just sit tight, Jerry.

22:21.480 --> 22:25.108
- Hello?
- Ted? Ted? Hello?

22:35.826 --> 22:37.703
Hey! Wait!

22:44.876 --> 22:46.628
Oh, no!

22:59.640 --> 23:01.600
Excuse me, Bernie.

23:05.103 --> 23:08.189
There is an issue.
It's that fuckin' Welbach.

23:14.987 --> 23:18.615
# You keep sayin'
you got somethin' for me

23:20.033 --> 23:24.037
# Something you call love,
but confess

23:25.955 --> 23:30.543
# You've been a-messin'
where you shouldn't been a-messin'

23:30.626 --> 23:34.463
# And now someone else
is gettin' all your best

23:37.049 --> 23:39.927
# These boots are made for walkin'

23:40.052 --> 23:42.596
# And that's just what they'll do

23:42.721 --> 23:47.642
# One of these days these boots
are gonna walk all over you... #

23:58.986 --> 24:03.448
# You keep lyin'
when you ought to be truthin'

24:04.449 --> 24:08.411
# And you keep losin'
when you ought to not bet

24:09.662 --> 24:14.583
# You keep samin'
when you ought to be a-changin'

24:14.667 --> 24:19.046
# Now what's right is right
but you ain't been right yet

24:20.672 --> 24:23.717
# These boots are made for walkin'

24:23.800 --> 24:26.594
# And that's just what they'll do

24:26.636 --> 24:31.724
# One of these days these boots
are gonna walk all over you

24:36.854 --> 24:38.230
# Yeah

24:42.150 --> 24:45.945
# You keep lyin'
when you ought to be truthin'

24:47.864 --> 24:51.325
# You keep losin'
when you ought to not bet

24:53.244 --> 24:57.664
# You keep samin'
when you ought to be a-changin'

24:57.748 --> 25:02.377
# Now what's right is right
but you ain't been right yet... #

25:16.599 --> 25:18.434
You need to know straight out,

25:18.517 --> 25:21.645
I don't stand
for any motherfuckin' shit.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.772
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-mm.

25:23.813 --> 25:25.690
No shit at all.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.859
This is what you're gonna do.

25:27.942 --> 25:30.027
You're gonna stop crying. Shh.

25:31.612 --> 25:34.281
And you're gonna walk
out of here with me.

25:34.365 --> 25:36.575
Can you feel me, Sam?

25:36.659 --> 25:38.786
- Mmm.
- Good.

25:42.831 --> 25:44.624
Shh.

25:47.085 --> 25:51.756
#.. and what he knows
you ain't got time to learn

25:52.840 --> 25:55.885
# These boots were made for walkin'

25:55.968 --> 25:57.678
# And that's just what they'll do

25:58.720 --> 26:03.808
# One of these days these boots
are gonna walk all over you

26:09.313 --> 26:11.190
# Are you ready, boots? #

26:11.315 --> 26:13.317
Now, Sam, as I was saying...

26:13.442 --> 26:14.860
# Start walkin' #

26:22.826 --> 26:25.036
No, please! Please don't hurt me!

26:25.954 --> 26:28.039
Help me! Help me!

26:29.957 --> 26:31.125
Please!

26:31.209 --> 26:33.919
- Please!
- Where's your car?

26:34.003 --> 26:36.714
- Where's your fucking car?
- It's there!

26:48.975 --> 26:51.477
- Are you hurt?
- No.

26:51.602 --> 26:53.521
Yes. I don't know.

26:53.562 --> 26:55.272
Truck, truck, truck!

27:02.946 --> 27:05.407
Um, um... Sir?

27:06.574 --> 27:08.951
- Can you stop the car? Please.
- Why?

27:12.830 --> 27:15.666
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Just open...

27:33.849 --> 27:37.728
She told me, "Don't go. I don't want
you on that highway alone. "

27:37.853 --> 27:41.481
I said, "It'll be fine, Mom.
It'll be OK." But it's not, is it?

27:41.523 --> 27:43.984
- I'm dead.
- Well, you're not dead.

27:44.025 --> 27:48.279
You would have been dead
if I hadn't saved your life.

27:48.321 --> 27:50.948
Would you rather
it was you back there?

27:51.032 --> 27:53.200
I didn't think so.

27:56.704 --> 27:58.622
Are you gonna kill me?

28:00.040 --> 28:02.626
Depends on
too many variables to answer.

28:05.211 --> 28:07.046
Are you gonna rape me?

28:08.589 --> 28:10.299
That's not likely, no.

28:11.676 --> 28:13.302
Well, what do you want?

28:14.637 --> 28:17.014
I suspect the same thing
as the other guy.

28:18.390 --> 28:20.309
The pistol.

28:21.309 --> 28:25.647
The one that Jerry's havin' a hard
time coming back from Mexico with.

28:25.689 --> 28:26.731
Jerry?

28:26.815 --> 28:31.027
I work for Bernie Nayman,
who works for Arnold Margolese.

28:31.068 --> 28:34.155
- You heard of these people.
- Yeah, I have.

28:34.196 --> 28:36.991
- And your husband works for 'em.
- No.

28:37.032 --> 28:38.867
Well, he does.

28:38.909 --> 28:42.746
I know the selfish, no-good liar
works for them. He isn't my husband.

28:42.829 --> 28:47.458
Well, whatever he is to you,
Jerry is in the shit books.

28:47.542 --> 28:52.380
When you're in as much shit as he is,
you get skittish about your future.

28:52.463 --> 28:54.173
Clouds your judgement.

28:54.215 --> 28:57.509
There's a lot of people
interested in that gun.

28:57.551 --> 28:59.386
So what we got here is a...

28:59.428 --> 29:04.266
"he who controls the girl,
controls the pistol" situation.

29:04.432 --> 29:08.394
I'm a hostage? You blew that guy
to pieces for a fucking gun?

29:08.436 --> 29:10.271
This is so Jerry. Look...

29:10.313 --> 29:12.607
Sit down. Sit down.

29:12.648 --> 29:15.526
Um...

29:15.568 --> 29:17.444
Uh, uh...

29:18.821 --> 29:20.030
Look.

29:20.113 --> 29:23.783
Jerry and I broke up,
so if he's doing...

29:24.826 --> 29:28.371
I don't know what he's doing.
It's got nothing to do with me.

29:30.873 --> 29:32.792
You seem like a very nice girl.

29:32.792 --> 29:34.794
Thank you.

29:34.877 --> 29:39.006
But it's a fact,
in these life-threatening situations,

29:39.089 --> 29:41.633
human beings... lie.

29:43.051 --> 29:45.053
So you are gonna kill me.

29:47.013 --> 29:49.849
All right, look.

29:49.891 --> 29:53.853
If everything goes OK and Jerry comes
through without this getting funky,

29:53.936 --> 29:55.854
I don't think that'll happen.

29:55.896 --> 29:58.023
He gives me the pistol,
I give you to him.

29:59.274 --> 30:03.528
I'm just here
to regulate funkiness. OK?

30:04.487 --> 30:05.613
Go on.

30:12.286 --> 30:13.454
Great.

30:21.753 --> 30:24.047
Hyah. Hyah!

30:24.089 --> 30:25.507
Hyah!

30:29.010 --> 30:32.847
Come on, buddy. Come on, OK?
Just you and me. Yeah.

30:32.847 --> 30:34.432
Go!

30:35.474 --> 30:38.227
Go. Oh! You're such an ass.

30:38.352 --> 30:40.312
What are you...? No, no, no!

30:40.395 --> 30:42.439
I'm sorry! I didn't mean...

30:42.481 --> 30:43.857
Fuck!

30:44.899 --> 30:46.526
Fuck!

30:52.698 --> 30:53.741
Hey!

30:56.076 --> 30:58.370
- ¿Que pasa?
- Buenas noches.

30:58.454 --> 31:01.957
- Buenas noches.
- I need a lift to the next town.

31:04.793 --> 31:09.464
I need a ride
in your automobile to the next town.

31:09.505 --> 31:12.967
I can't pay you.
I have no money. No dinero.

31:13.050 --> 31:14.844
- De Niro?
- Sí. None.

31:14.927 --> 31:16.011
Robert De Niro?

31:17.471 --> 31:19.306
Robert De Niro!

31:19.348 --> 31:24.644
Yeah. Uh, I need a lift
in your el truck-o

31:24.811 --> 31:26.604
to the next town-o.

31:26.729 --> 31:30.775
- Uh, village-o. Uh, uh, pueblo.
- Ah, pueblo.

31:30.858 --> 31:33.235
- Yeah, sí!
- Al otro pueblo. OK.

31:33.277 --> 31:35.196
- Yes?
- Señor De Niro!

31:40.492 --> 31:44.329
Self-winding. You never have
to wind it. It's very fine.

31:44.412 --> 31:48.124
Yeah. Shake like...
Perpetual calendar.

31:48.249 --> 31:50.418
It's good.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.964
Is this even gonna run?

31:55.005 --> 31:56.799
Yeah?

32:02.554 --> 32:03.972
Hey. That your ball?

32:05.181 --> 32:08.518
Shit. Hey. Hey, man.

32:08.601 --> 32:10.561
You got a rabid dog back here.

32:10.686 --> 32:12.396
Go. Go!

32:12.438 --> 32:14.773
Go. Out.

32:19.194 --> 32:22.239
You gotta do something
about this dog.

32:30.204 --> 32:34.500
'I have a collect call
for Samantha from Jerry Welbach.

32:34.583 --> 32:37.669
- 'No one there, sir. '
- 'Give it a second. '

32:37.711 --> 32:41.340
Sam, pick up the phone.
Sams? Samsonite?

32:41.381 --> 32:43.216
Baby, please don't do this.

32:43.258 --> 32:45.427
- 'Please try again, sir'
- No!

32:45.427 --> 32:47.845
Just give it a second. She's there...

33:14.203 --> 33:16.121
What are you doing?

33:16.163 --> 33:18.624
- You're gonna make a call.
- To whom?

33:18.749 --> 33:20.459
To Jerry.

33:20.542 --> 33:24.004
You're gonna tell him that Leroy
is with you then you hang up.

33:24.087 --> 33:26.881
- Leroy?
- Yeah. Leroy, that's right.

33:26.965 --> 33:29.133
Then you're gonna hang up. Simple.

33:29.217 --> 33:31.052
That's it?

33:31.177 --> 33:33.095
It's enough. Believe me.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.812
You gonna make the call
or do I have to make you? Cos I will.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.314
- No. I'll call.
- Good.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.192
Dial it.

33:48.234 --> 33:51.362
OK. What's the number?

33:52.613 --> 33:54.448
You have the number.

33:55.866 --> 33:59.161
I don't know where he is.
You should have the number.

33:59.203 --> 34:03.665
What are you tellin' me? You don't
have a number, a motel, nothing?

34:03.790 --> 34:07.961
What's the matter, don't you listen?
We broke up. No longer together.

34:08.085 --> 34:10.045
Why would I have the number?

34:21.598 --> 34:23.975
I'm sensing you have trust issues.

34:25.851 --> 34:27.853
You got one minute.

34:45.078 --> 34:47.956
I'm a professional.
I do this for a living.

34:47.996 --> 34:49.956
Goody for you.

34:58.799 --> 35:00.759
You're wasting your time.

35:02.427 --> 35:06.389
# You're nobody
till somebody loves you... #

35:06.473 --> 35:08.558
I think I believe you.

35:09.684 --> 35:15.606
# You're nobody
till somebody cares...

35:15.856 --> 35:17.566
What's in Vegas?

35:22.154 --> 35:27.742
Uh, well... I'm gonna be a waitress,
then make a career as a croupier.

35:27.825 --> 35:32.830
They can make $100,000 a year but you
have to have the hands, which I do.

35:32.913 --> 35:35.749
I got them from Grandma Vega,
which is a good thing

35:35.874 --> 35:39.044
cos my Granny Barzel
had hands like a circus midget.

35:39.086 --> 35:41.254
How come you can't live with Jerry?

35:42.756 --> 35:44.466
Do you know Jerry?

35:46.009 --> 35:50.012
He has trouble expressing feelings.
He had a fucked-up childhood.

35:50.179 --> 35:54.725
His mom is nuts. One of those people
who thinks the iron is always on.

35:54.809 --> 35:59.062
- Don't you love him?
- I think that's the problem.

35:59.104 --> 36:01.440
We love each other too much.

36:01.481 --> 36:03.400
But he's... He's so selfish.

36:03.441 --> 36:06.277
It's like we've been living
his life forever.

36:06.319 --> 36:10.698
He'd tell you a different story,
but I give and he just keeps taking.

36:10.740 --> 36:14.201
Our counselor totally
agrees with me, by the way.

36:14.285 --> 36:17.246
I don't put much stock
in those counselor types.

36:17.371 --> 36:20.165
All they do is sit around
and smoke joints.

36:20.290 --> 36:23.168
Maybe, but Jerry is still a taker
and I'm a giver.

36:23.210 --> 36:25.128
It's obvious.

36:25.211 --> 36:27.839
A lot of people
are under the impression

36:27.964 --> 36:30.174
that you get to choose who you love.

36:31.217 --> 36:33.761
I'm sorry, are you...

36:33.844 --> 36:36.930
Are you taking his side?
You're a man, of course.

36:37.014 --> 36:41.518
- You're taking his side.
- You love him. You said so yourself.

36:41.643 --> 36:43.979
It's all that matters.

36:47.357 --> 36:50.318
You're a very sensitive person
for a killer.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.280
Thank you, Sam.

37:16.008 --> 37:17.426
Shit.

37:24.474 --> 37:26.726
Get. Get out. Out.

37:26.810 --> 37:29.270
Look, you gotta get out.

37:29.312 --> 37:31.063
Get out!

37:51.457 --> 37:52.958
Go!

38:11.726 --> 38:14.186
Hola, shithead! Where's my stuff?

38:14.228 --> 38:16.188
Get back! Where's my stuff?

38:16.230 --> 38:20.150
- Pistol. Pistolero. Get back.
- La pistola.

38:21.610 --> 38:23.320
Get back!

38:23.403 --> 38:25.530
Stay calm. Get back, get back!

38:26.448 --> 38:30.118
Don't move.
What the f...? Give me those.

38:31.202 --> 38:33.287
Back! Back, back.

38:33.371 --> 38:36.582
Get in the car. Get in! OK.

38:36.624 --> 38:39.001
Is that my...? Is that my jacket?

38:39.042 --> 38:44.256
Put it in the car! What is wrong
with you people? Get back!

39:07.151 --> 39:10.446
- You don't have to be in here.
- I go by track record.

39:10.530 --> 39:14.909
- I don't hear any tinkle, tinkle.
- Stage fright.

39:14.992 --> 39:17.703
Look around,
there's not even a window.

39:18.871 --> 39:23.416
So what's with this "We've been
livin' his life forever" thing?

39:23.458 --> 39:25.335
I didn't mean it literally.

39:25.418 --> 39:29.255
Jerry's been working for Margolese
for five years less a day.

39:29.380 --> 39:31.299
It just feels lifelong.

39:31.340 --> 39:33.676
- Sounds like jail terms.
- It is.

39:33.759 --> 39:37.596
Arnold Margolese is in jail
because Jerry put him there.

39:40.265 --> 39:43.143
Jerry ratted out Arnold Margolese?

39:43.226 --> 39:47.605
No. Jerry was coming across Ventura,
over there by Laurel Canyon.

39:47.730 --> 39:50.191
- Yeah?
- He wasn't paying attention,

39:50.233 --> 39:53.652
ran a red light,
smashed into Margolese's Cadillac.

39:53.736 --> 39:58.699
The cops came, Margolese got busted
cos he had a person in the trunk.

39:58.782 --> 40:01.368
That's how Margolese
got sent to jail?!

40:01.451 --> 40:02.786
Mm-hmm.

40:04.663 --> 40:07.582
- Live person or dead person?
- Live person.

40:07.707 --> 40:10.251
Huh. What's the big deal, then?

40:10.418 --> 40:12.920
He probably wasn't
gonna stay that way.

40:13.045 --> 40:16.048
He was taped up in a trunk
for a reason, wasn't he?

40:16.173 --> 40:19.468
I would think this was
right up your alley, Swifty.

40:21.428 --> 40:24.639
- He saw something?
- Whatever it was this guy saw,

40:24.681 --> 40:27.559
or was going to say to the cops,
he got the chance.

40:27.600 --> 40:32.063
Since it was Jerry's fault, Margolese
had him work off the jail time.

40:32.188 --> 40:35.024
My whole relationship
has been hijacked

40:35.107 --> 40:38.402
because he doesn't pay attention
when he drives.

40:40.487 --> 40:42.781
I... I can't go with you in here.

41:01.798 --> 41:05.593
We didn't think we were getting
a dead man with the car.

41:05.635 --> 41:08.263
I got no use for a dead gringo.
Take a left.

41:30.908 --> 41:32.827
Come on.

41:37.790 --> 41:40.584
If you're going to kill me,
at least tell me

41:40.667 --> 41:43.211
who it is that's going
to send me to God.

41:44.296 --> 41:45.630
Tell me!

41:47.382 --> 41:49.217
Look, I'm not gonna kill you.

41:51.552 --> 41:53.679
But I am gonna have to shoot you.

41:55.347 --> 41:57.224
But why, sir? Why?

41:57.266 --> 41:59.226
Why? Because you stole from me,

41:59.351 --> 42:02.270
you know about the pistol
and you'll steal again.

42:02.354 --> 42:05.398
I can't have you coming back
like a fly in the ointment.

42:05.482 --> 42:08.026
I won't be a fly!
You'll never see me again.

42:08.109 --> 42:09.819
You're gettin' shot, that's it.

42:09.861 --> 42:13.114
It'll take time to walk to town,
especially limping...

42:13.155 --> 42:14.698
Wait, wait. Limping?

42:14.824 --> 42:18.577
Can't you just tie me up some more?
Fuck! You shoot me? Tie me!

42:18.702 --> 42:20.996
Yeah. I don't have a rope.

42:21.079 --> 42:22.664
So you shoot me?

42:22.789 --> 42:25.583
It's the American way.

42:27.669 --> 42:29.670
Where do you want it?

42:32.632 --> 42:33.716
OK.

42:33.799 --> 42:37.970
Not the leg! There's arteries.
I could bleed to death in seconds.

42:38.011 --> 42:39.263
The foot.

42:40.806 --> 42:44.643
That's fair where I come from. OK?
It'll hurt, but it'll heal.

42:44.726 --> 42:47.103
What if you take off a fucking toe!

42:47.145 --> 42:49.397
Wait, wait, wait. Not the left.

42:49.439 --> 42:51.566
Oh, sorry.

42:51.691 --> 42:53.984
On the count of three.

42:54.026 --> 42:56.904
One...

42:57.029 --> 43:01.324
Look, I'm agreeing with you.
But there's a few ways to look at it.

43:01.408 --> 43:03.660
Sex is, no matter what anybody says,

43:03.827 --> 43:06.454
a very important part
of any relationship.

43:06.538 --> 43:10.041
The fact that Jerry
is a considerate lover says a lot.

43:12.084 --> 43:15.379
- You lost me.
- Well, he's a considerate lover.

43:15.421 --> 43:19.841
You gotta find a way to get him to
expand this quality he has during sex

43:19.925 --> 43:22.260
to other areas of your relationship.

43:22.427 --> 43:25.722
Even if it only comes out in sex,
it's there just the same.

43:27.724 --> 43:30.143
That's a good point.

43:30.226 --> 43:34.647
If a person's a considerate lover,
he can't be all selfish, right?

43:37.358 --> 43:39.109
Unless of course he's...

43:44.406 --> 43:48.368
- He's, uh, being a considerate...
- What was that?

43:50.369 --> 43:51.537
What?

43:52.788 --> 43:54.790
That. That moment you had.

43:55.958 --> 43:58.293
What moment?

43:59.378 --> 44:02.756
Leroy, you just checked out
that guy and had a moment.

44:02.797 --> 44:05.133
That was a moment.

44:08.386 --> 44:10.429
I don't know if it was a moment.

44:15.517 --> 44:18.562
- As in happy?
- As in homosexual.

44:21.064 --> 44:25.026
What does my sexual orientation
have to do with our conversation?

44:25.110 --> 44:26.653
Nothing.

44:26.778 --> 44:31.073
Nothing. Except something that you
said back there really bugged me

44:31.157 --> 44:33.826
and this would kind of
help it make sense.

44:33.909 --> 44:36.453
Yeah? What's that?

44:36.495 --> 44:39.790
I asked if you were gonna rape me,
you said, "Not likely. "

44:39.873 --> 44:42.334
You said it so coldly,
like I was repulsive

44:42.459 --> 44:46.754
and it was ludicrous to think I was
actually at risk of being raped.

44:48.298 --> 44:52.176
First of all, it's a crime of anger,
not attraction.

44:52.218 --> 44:56.680
Second of all, you're not repulsive.
You're very beautiful.

44:56.722 --> 44:58.557
Thank you.

44:58.599 --> 45:01.059
- You want me to rape you?
- Are you gay?

45:01.101 --> 45:03.687
- You want me to rape you?
- You're gay.

45:04.896 --> 45:06.898
You're gay. I knew it!

45:07.023 --> 45:09.817
Oh, I so knew it.
I just knew it. What a relief.

45:09.942 --> 45:14.363
Do you want a medal? A little trinket
saying you identified a homosexual?

45:14.488 --> 45:16.824
No.

45:16.824 --> 45:18.700
Are you full throttle?

45:21.620 --> 45:23.163
Full throttle?

45:31.504 --> 45:33.381
Yeah, I guess I am.

45:33.422 --> 45:36.675
Oh. I'm not... I mean...

45:36.717 --> 45:40.220
I'm not trying to be a smart-ass
or anything like that.

45:40.304 --> 45:42.514
I just... I think this is great.

45:42.597 --> 45:44.432
Wow. This is...

45:44.516 --> 45:47.769
This is... major, OK?

45:47.852 --> 45:51.981
I... know the kind of people
in your business, OK?

45:52.106 --> 45:56.193
- Yeah?
- And to me, it seems that...

45:56.235 --> 46:01.948
Well, being gay isn't really...
conducive to the environment.

46:03.033 --> 46:07.078
Like I should be an interior
decorator. That's insulting.

46:07.203 --> 46:10.915
- I am very good at what I do.
- Do you have a boyfriend?

46:13.376 --> 46:15.085
No, I don't.

46:16.462 --> 46:19.923
Unfortunately,
I seem to be unable to keep...

46:20.007 --> 46:21.842
relationships together.

46:24.177 --> 46:28.556
Seems like everybody's having trouble
keeping relationships together.

47:02.629 --> 47:04.464
It's ringing, señor.

47:06.508 --> 47:10.052
- Thank you for that.
- No, no, no. No necesario.

47:10.094 --> 47:11.971
Really?

47:13.806 --> 47:16.350
That's so kind.
You have no idea what...

47:16.433 --> 47:18.560
'Hi, this is Ted. Leave a message.

47:18.602 --> 47:20.979
'If this is my guy in need,
I'm on my way.

47:21.063 --> 47:24.899
'Go to the Hotel de la Plaza.
Wait for me there, OK? Sit tight. '

47:24.983 --> 47:27.860
OK, OK. Forget aeropuerto.

47:27.902 --> 47:29.946
Uh, Hotel de la Plaza.

47:34.158 --> 47:37.077
Hola.

47:37.161 --> 47:39.454
- Is this your dog?
- Sort of.

47:39.496 --> 47:41.873
Came along for the ride.

47:42.916 --> 47:45.794
He has a personality
and that does count.

47:45.877 --> 47:49.380
- He's a good guy.
- Is this your car?

47:49.422 --> 47:51.966
It's a rental. I'm an American.

47:52.049 --> 47:54.260
- No shit? Really?
- Yeah.

47:55.594 --> 47:56.970
I'm Mexican.

47:58.972 --> 48:00.849
Cool.

48:00.974 --> 48:03.351
Do you have a passport?

48:09.774 --> 48:14.737
- Jerry Wellbatch, Los Angeles, USA.
- Welbach... Wellbatch.

48:16.739 --> 48:18.574
Can I ask you a question, Jerry?

48:20.492 --> 48:22.202
How long have you been in Mexico?

48:24.287 --> 48:27.832
- A few days. Pleasure.
- I see.

48:27.916 --> 48:30.376
- Pleasure, huh?
- Yeah.

48:30.418 --> 48:35.256
I see. Can you tell me,
uh, what happened here?

48:38.175 --> 48:40.844
That's not accurate, I'm afraid.

48:40.969 --> 48:45.056
The gunsmith did craft this pistol
for a prospective husband,

48:45.140 --> 48:47.684
and he was a nobleman's son, true.

48:47.767 --> 48:51.687
But the motif was darker, my friend.

48:51.812 --> 48:54.023
It's cursed, this gun.

48:57.609 --> 49:02.280
'The key to this tale
involves the gunsmith's assistant,

49:03.448 --> 49:07.160
'a poor, but honorable
young man in blinding love

49:07.285 --> 49:09.954
'with the gunsmith's daughter.

49:09.996 --> 49:13.833
'For months at a time,
the assistant took to the mines

49:13.999 --> 49:16.085
'gathering the precious metal

49:16.168 --> 49:20.714
'that would yield the most
beautiful gun that ever existed,

49:20.756 --> 49:25.010
'only to discover that what he hoped
could be a wedding gift for him...

49:26.386 --> 49:28.012
'was for another.

49:28.179 --> 49:31.933
'The gunsmith insisted his daughter
marry the nobleman's son,

49:31.974 --> 49:34.310
'forbidding their love.

49:36.979 --> 49:40.649
'Angered in his bitter pain,
the assistant cursed the gun,

49:40.732 --> 49:43.485
'vowing the creation
would never prevail.

49:48.114 --> 49:51.409
'But the gunsmith
was racing against time.

49:51.450 --> 49:54.870
'He had promised a pistol
of unparalleled craftsmanship,

49:54.995 --> 49:57.664
'the nobleman's dowry
hanging in the balance.

50:01.084 --> 50:05.755
'He worked day and night
to correct the pistol's problems. '

50:28.276 --> 50:31.320
This gun never worked properly.

50:31.445 --> 50:35.532
Some say its very creation
ended the gunsmith's life.

50:45.166 --> 50:49.128
Well, my friend, you're free to go,
but without the gun.

50:49.253 --> 50:52.214
This gun doesn't belong
to you or to your boss.

50:52.256 --> 50:54.216
Now it belongs to me.

50:56.051 --> 50:59.513
Yeah, Vegas.
It can be tough that way.

50:59.721 --> 51:03.350
Expensive?
Yeah, emotionally.

51:03.391 --> 51:05.727
I had a serious relationship problem.

51:05.810 --> 51:09.272
Well, you fit right in here.

51:09.522 --> 51:15.361
- What do you do now, Frank?
- Now... I am a postman.

51:15.402 --> 51:17.780
Get out of here.

51:17.863 --> 51:20.032
- That's so rigid.
- Swear to God.

51:20.157 --> 51:22.701
There's a seedy underbelly
to the postal service.

51:22.826 --> 51:25.412
- Is that the key to it?
- That's the key.

51:25.495 --> 51:27.705
You have no idea how many small,

51:27.830 --> 51:30.917
unmarked brown paper packages
I deliver.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.753
- What, porno?
- Yeah, daily.

51:33.878 --> 51:35.379
Like what?

51:35.421 --> 51:39.925
Videos, blow-up dolls,
dildos, pocket pussies.

51:40.050 --> 51:43.011
- Don't leave nothing out.
- Oh, yeah?

51:43.094 --> 51:46.931
But even with all that
dirty excitement at my fingertips,

51:47.015 --> 51:49.475
I still have to take off
once a year.

51:49.600 --> 51:54.188
I just get up and I know I'm going
to Vegas, I just don't know how.

51:54.230 --> 51:57.066
All I've got is my wallet
and an attitude.

51:58.817 --> 52:01.319
I don't know, it keeps me sane.

52:01.403 --> 52:04.906
After all, guns don't kill people...

52:04.989 --> 52:07.075
postal workers do.

52:31.389 --> 52:33.391
OK, you're all set, Mr. Shurker.

52:33.516 --> 52:36.393
If you go to the front,
a shuttle will pick you up.

52:36.477 --> 52:38.520
What kind of car is it exactly?

52:38.604 --> 52:40.564
It's a Chrysler, sir, brand-new.

52:40.564 --> 52:44.651
You wouldn't happen to have
something a little more...

52:44.776 --> 52:46.027
Raoul!

52:57.204 --> 52:58.997
Yeah, man!

52:59.122 --> 53:01.416
Yeah. Never fear, Teddy's here.

53:01.541 --> 53:03.752
How are you?

53:15.429 --> 53:17.973
'Rosco!'

53:18.056 --> 53:21.476
Come on, Jerry.
The Mexican thief, the dirty cop?

53:21.560 --> 53:24.229
The word is out.
It's a big-ticket item.

53:24.312 --> 53:27.690
A lot of fucking people
are interested in that gun.

53:29.400 --> 53:32.778
No fucking...
Is that what they think?

53:32.820 --> 53:34.738
That I'm selling them out?

53:34.780 --> 53:38.492
Maybe they think you're scared
and might do the wrong thing.

53:38.575 --> 53:40.619
- Ted.
- You know, I don't know.

53:40.744 --> 53:44.789
- I'm just doing my portion here.
- Yeah, and what is that?

53:44.873 --> 53:49.335
To find out what's going on, assess
the damage, try to calm you down,

53:49.460 --> 53:52.630
help find the pistol, get us home.

53:52.713 --> 53:57.134
I get on that plane, pistol or not.
it'll be the last flight I ever take.

53:57.176 --> 54:00.345
- Oh, come on, Jerry.
- "Come on"? You know it.

54:00.387 --> 54:03.348
- I know what I have to know.
- Doing your part.

54:03.431 --> 54:05.183
I know what I have to know.

54:05.225 --> 54:07.977
You sound like Schultz
from Hogan's Heroes.

54:08.102 --> 54:10.188
I know nothing!

54:10.229 --> 54:13.065
I don't like Nayman
running things either.

54:13.107 --> 54:16.944
I got a few years on you and I'm
telling you, keep your nose clean,

54:17.027 --> 54:19.947
look straight ahead
and do what you're told.

54:19.988 --> 54:24.159
That's why I nearly paid off
Boca Raton. I do my fuckin' portions.

54:25.994 --> 54:28.079
I don't care how you look at it,

54:28.121 --> 54:31.415
the first step out of this
is to get the pistol back.

54:32.458 --> 54:34.460
I never took a pay-off in my life.

54:34.585 --> 54:38.046
Jerry, look,
I know where your loyalties lie.

54:38.172 --> 54:41.800
But the kid's dead.
The pistol's gone.

54:41.842 --> 54:44.719
I mean, you can see
how it looks, right?

54:44.761 --> 54:46.137
Come on.

54:47.847 --> 54:49.557
You're my guy.

55:34.306 --> 55:38.227
# We can dance if we want to
we've got all your life and mine

55:38.310 --> 55:40.771
# As long as we abuse it,
never gonna lose it

55:40.854 --> 55:42.939
# Everything will work out right

55:43.023 --> 55:44.941
# I say, we can dance if we want to

55:44.983 --> 55:47.610
# We can leave your friends behind

55:47.694 --> 55:50.947
# Cos your friends don't dance
and if they don't dance, well they're

55:50.988 --> 55:52.615
# No friends of mine

55:52.740 --> 55:56.076
# I say, we can dance, we can dance,
everything's out of control

55:56.118 --> 55:59.204
# We can dance, we can dance

55:59.204 --> 56:01.415
# They're doing it from pole to pole

56:01.498 --> 56:05.126
# We can dance, we can dance,
everybody look at your hands... #

56:05.210 --> 56:07.879
Not the safest dance!

56:25.979 --> 56:28.398
I'm not going anywhere.

56:33.360 --> 56:36.780
We are in the city
where I'm going to be living.

56:46.581 --> 56:47.749
Go.

56:50.376 --> 56:52.295
What's wrong? Huh?

56:55.839 --> 56:59.551
You know when you're in
a bad relationship and you separate?

56:59.635 --> 57:04.431
All of a sudden, everywhere you look
there's love and possibility.

57:08.685 --> 57:10.603
I'm worried about Jerry.

57:12.146 --> 57:13.939
All right, don't worry.

57:14.023 --> 57:16.734
I'll call Nayman
and check in on everything.

57:23.615 --> 57:25.575
You want me to stay?

57:28.786 --> 57:30.830
I want you to go.

57:30.913 --> 57:33.374
You sure?

57:34.542 --> 57:37.002
I really want you to go.

58:11.951 --> 58:14.161
I couldn't sleep all night.

58:14.286 --> 58:19.666
Yeah. No, he said he followed
the cop to the pawn shop.

58:19.791 --> 58:22.544
He's taking me over there
after breakfast.

58:22.669 --> 58:26.464
We're booked on the seven o'clock
if all goes well.

58:26.548 --> 58:30.510
No, now wait... No...
No, you wait a minute, Nayman.

58:30.635 --> 58:34.013
Now what do you gotta go
and say that for?

58:34.054 --> 58:36.098
Well, now or later?

58:36.181 --> 58:38.934
How could I misinterpret?

58:38.976 --> 58:42.771
No, you didn't send the wrong guy.
I'm handling things.

58:42.854 --> 58:44.981
But I never signed up for that.

58:45.023 --> 58:49.235
Listen, I promise you, when I tell
him, it'll make a difference.

58:51.654 --> 58:53.155
Bye.

59:02.164 --> 59:06.376
Hey, sweets. I keep calling
and I haven't heard a word from you.

59:06.459 --> 59:08.378
I'm starting to wonder.

59:08.419 --> 59:11.380
I know you're angry with me,
but, uh...

59:12.715 --> 59:16.093
You know,
"Ain't no sunshine when she's gone".

59:17.678 --> 59:19.513
OK?

59:22.766 --> 59:25.518
I think she actually went to Vegas.

59:25.602 --> 59:29.272
I keep telling you,
these women are problems, you know?

59:29.355 --> 59:32.441
You should try to be like me -
I answer to myself.

59:32.525 --> 59:37.154
No hassles, nobody ridin' my ass like
a goddamn horse in a saddle. Free.

59:37.237 --> 59:42.242
You close yourself off so you have
no shot at meeting the right woman.

59:42.325 --> 59:45.703
Any woman can be the right woman
if the numbers work.

59:45.787 --> 59:48.289
No way. Not me.

59:48.373 --> 59:52.752
You settle. You open yourself up.
You become vulnerable.

59:52.835 --> 59:55.379
What's the insight
into my relationship?

59:58.006 --> 01:00:01.843
OK, look, Jerry. She is in Vegas.

01:00:01.927 --> 01:00:03.637
What?

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.972
Hey, shit falls down, you know?

01:00:06.014 --> 01:00:07.807
Shit falls down?

01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:11.811
Margolese called Nayman all pissed
off cos you were fucking this up,

01:00:11.936 --> 01:00:14.355
told him to keep an eye on Sam
in case...

01:00:14.396 --> 01:00:18.984
In case I get any funny ideas.
You're just telling me this now?

01:00:19.026 --> 01:00:22.237
- There's other things to consider.
- Like what?

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.241
That gun's worth a lot. People know
you have it. Sam could be in danger.

01:00:26.282 --> 01:00:28.326
No shit. Who did they put on her?

01:00:28.409 --> 01:00:30.745
You don't know him,
but you know of him.

01:00:30.828 --> 01:00:33.164
- Who?
- That fucking psycho Leroy.

01:00:33.205 --> 01:00:35.833
- Leroy!
- Nayman had to. It was an order.

01:00:35.916 --> 01:00:38.210
Margolese would know if he didn't.

01:00:38.252 --> 01:00:40.212
Wait.

01:00:40.337 --> 01:00:42.714
They're just trying to scare me.

01:00:42.797 --> 01:00:45.592
Well, that would sure do it for me.

01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:48.386
We've all heard
the kidney story, Jerry.

01:00:48.428 --> 01:00:53.182
Nayman wants us on that seven o'clock
flight, pistol in tow. No buts.

01:00:53.265 --> 01:00:57.561
They'll meet us at the airport
and then Leroy will take the pistol.

01:00:58.729 --> 01:01:00.272
Yeah.

01:02:34.066 --> 01:02:35.776
I had to borrow...

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:37.861
Do you mind?

01:02:40.447 --> 01:02:42.324
Sleep well?!

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.785
Yeah. You?

01:02:50.498 --> 01:02:51.916
Who's Winston?

01:02:54.793 --> 01:02:57.504
Somebody I don't like very much.

01:02:57.546 --> 01:03:00.507
You can have that removed, you know?

01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:02.509
Yeah, maybe I will someday.

01:03:16.313 --> 01:03:18.440
You wanna get some breakfast?

01:04:06.693 --> 01:04:11.739
# I've seen you round
for a long, long time

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:15.451
# I really remember you
when you drank my wine

01:04:15.576 --> 01:04:20.163
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:26.503
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?

01:04:26.628 --> 01:04:31.465
# I seen you walking
down in Chinatown

01:04:31.507 --> 01:04:35.219
# I called you
but you could not look around

01:04:35.344 --> 01:04:39.973
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?

01:04:40.432 --> 01:04:45.437
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends? #

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.815
At first,
I thought this guy is all right.

01:04:48.898 --> 01:04:52.735
And then I'm thinking he's more than
all right, he's terrific.

01:04:52.777 --> 01:04:56.572
But there's no way he's gonna
feel the same way about me.

01:04:58.157 --> 01:04:59.741
Then I find out he does.

01:05:02.786 --> 01:05:05.622
Then I'm thinking...

01:05:05.747 --> 01:05:09.250
what happens when
he finds out what I do...

01:05:09.333 --> 01:05:11.669
and who I am and what I've done?

01:05:13.129 --> 01:05:16.382
You know, who am I kidding, right?
Let's get serious.

01:05:16.423 --> 01:05:18.383
What are you gonna do about it?

01:05:18.509 --> 01:05:21.011
That's it.
I didn't have to do anything.

01:05:21.053 --> 01:05:24.848
It happened absent of my will
to consciously make it happen.

01:05:24.973 --> 01:05:26.766
Oh, really?

01:05:26.933 --> 01:05:29.352
I was a little drunk last night.

01:05:29.435 --> 01:05:33.689
I took my gun and I put it in
the towels in the bathroom, you know?

01:05:36.358 --> 01:05:38.068
And he found it.

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:45.200
And he said,
"The past doesn't matter.

01:05:47.827 --> 01:05:49.912
"It's the future that counts. "

01:05:49.954 --> 01:05:51.789
Leroy.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.043
See, life can change.

01:05:56.126 --> 01:05:58.045
People can change.

01:06:06.386 --> 01:06:08.346
I haven't cried in 12 years.

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.183
What are you lookin' at?

01:06:13.225 --> 01:06:16.645
Don't look at me like that.
You're makin' it worse.

01:06:16.687 --> 01:06:18.939
What are you, Barbara Walters?

01:06:19.022 --> 01:06:21.608
It's just beautiful.

01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:24.361
Let's talk about somethin' else.

01:06:24.444 --> 01:06:29.198
- What do you wanna talk about?
- Anything. Anything else. Whatever.

01:06:31.075 --> 01:06:33.786
What was it over,
the last time you cried?

01:06:33.869 --> 01:06:36.038
Let's talk about that.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.832
Oh, yeah,
that'll bring the sun right out

01:06:39.791 --> 01:06:42.335
I heard
it was this guy Leroy's mother.

01:06:42.419 --> 01:06:44.629
OK, that's what we call bullshit.

01:06:44.671 --> 01:06:47.006
If I told one guy
at the next convention

01:06:47.048 --> 01:06:50.009
that you kept your mother
cut up in the freezer,

01:06:50.051 --> 01:06:51.927
you'd have a reputation too.

01:06:51.969 --> 01:06:54.305
Fact or not, it makes no difference.

01:06:54.388 --> 01:06:56.807
Jesus, Ted, you can't be so naïïve.

01:06:56.932 --> 01:06:59.059
- The guy's a star.
- Oh, my God.

01:06:59.142 --> 01:07:02.479
Why are you so worried
then if you think it's bullshit?

01:07:02.562 --> 01:07:05.565
I met Leroy once.
It was for all of two seconds.

01:07:05.607 --> 01:07:08.109
I shook his hand.
He seemed like a nice guy.

01:07:08.234 --> 01:07:11.529
Whether or not he lives up
to his legend isn't the point.

01:07:11.654 --> 01:07:15.366
Or if he sits in his garage
soaked in gasoline lighting matches,

01:07:15.491 --> 01:07:16.909
I don't care.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:20.329
What concerns me
is he was hired in the first place.

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:24.374
- Are you with me?
- Geez, Jerry, you really met him?

01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:26.334
Oh, my God!

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:29.629
Ted is not gonna let anything happen,
OK? I'm here.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:31.756
Thanks, Ted. I feel real safe.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:37.761
- Hola.
- I no fuck around, comprende?

01:07:37.886 --> 01:07:41.056
Gun, gun, loaded.
Bang, bang. You, dead.

01:07:41.139 --> 01:07:44.017
Do you have a speech impediment?

01:07:45.226 --> 01:07:48.062
- Give me the gun. The pistol.
- The pistol?

01:07:48.146 --> 01:07:50.273
You know what I'm talkin' about.

01:07:50.273 --> 01:07:53.192
- The pistol?
- OK, what's your name?

01:07:53.275 --> 01:07:55.069
Joe.

01:07:55.152 --> 01:07:58.655
Joe, do what he says and we'll
be out of here before you know it.

01:07:58.739 --> 01:08:00.699
- The pistol, please.
- OK.

01:08:00.824 --> 01:08:02.367
Thank you.

01:08:03.702 --> 01:08:05.245
Excuse me.

01:08:13.961 --> 01:08:16.587
Come on. Go.

01:08:20.216 --> 01:08:22.385
Got it.

01:08:22.511 --> 01:08:24.763
Just have a seat right here, amigo.

01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:41.444
Jerry! Have you lost your mind?

01:08:41.569 --> 01:08:43.613
What were you talking about
on the phone?

01:08:43.738 --> 01:08:45.448
Put the gun away.

01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:48.743
Was it to off me?
Is that what you two were discussing?

01:08:48.826 --> 01:08:51.746
- Jerry, I would never...
- Go ahead, deny it! Go ahead.

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:53.413
- Go ahead!
- OK, OK.

01:08:53.497 --> 01:08:55.957
Jerry, that's what he said.

01:08:58.794 --> 01:09:02.171
So you were lying when you said
I'd walk away from this?

01:09:02.214 --> 01:09:06.301
- No, Jerry, that's what he said.
- Then you're lying to me now.

01:09:06.426 --> 01:09:09.845
No, no. Nayman told me to do it,
Jerry, but...

01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:12.348
- But?
- But...

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:16.225
But you're just doing your portion.
Isn't that how it works?

01:09:16.393 --> 01:09:19.395
17 portions left for Boca...
Boca Raton, right?

01:09:19.438 --> 01:09:21.773
I wouldn't do that. Come on, I swear!

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:25.734
They tell you to bring me in,
then they tell you to take me out.

01:09:25.819 --> 01:09:28.946
Why are you being told
two contradicting things?

01:09:29.029 --> 01:09:33.576
- You don't ask a question?
- I-I just... I... I don't know.

01:09:33.701 --> 01:09:37.871
- You don't think it's weird?
- Yeah, it's... It's weird.

01:09:37.912 --> 01:09:41.374
Right! Because something's going on.
What is it?

01:09:48.046 --> 01:09:51.550
Exactly. You don't know,
you're just doing your fucking part.

01:09:51.634 --> 01:09:54.637
Well, I'm not going down
because you don't know!

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.557
You see my predicament?

01:10:02.227 --> 01:10:04.604
You're my guy, Ted.

01:10:06.773 --> 01:10:08.566
You're my guy, Jerry.

01:10:41.304 --> 01:10:43.056
Wait. What happened here?

01:10:43.181 --> 01:10:46.392
Someone killed themselves.
Swan-dived off the balcony.

01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:47.977
Let's go.

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:51.814
Stay back. Nothin' to see here.

01:10:53.607 --> 01:10:55.442
Walk on.

01:10:55.526 --> 01:10:58.320
Thank you very much.
Sorry to have disturbed you.

01:11:01.198 --> 01:11:02.991
Hotel security.

01:11:22.008 --> 01:11:24.010
No.

01:11:24.135 --> 01:11:25.970
Please, no.

01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:36.021
No. No.

01:11:41.068 --> 01:11:42.819
Coming.

01:11:43.695 --> 01:11:46.072
Sir, there's been
a terrible incident.

01:11:46.156 --> 01:11:48.991
Are all parties
in your room accounted for?

01:11:48.991 --> 01:11:52.536
Yeah. Yeah.
Just me and my wife. Honey!

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.747
No, that's OK, sir. Thank you.

01:11:54.788 --> 01:11:57.041
- What happened?
- Sorry to disturb you.

01:11:58.584 --> 01:12:00.460
Everything all right?

01:12:03.672 --> 01:12:05.465
Leroy...

01:12:07.842 --> 01:12:09.802
Pack your shit.

01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:33.379
Shh, shh.

01:13:54.273 --> 01:13:55.733
Psst.

01:13:57.734 --> 01:14:01.071
You're a stupid motherfucker,
you know that?

01:14:01.196 --> 01:14:04.532
You're well dressed,
I'll give you that, but stupid.

01:14:06.409 --> 01:14:08.369
Wear Kevlar? Huh?

01:14:10.413 --> 01:14:12.123
Yeah.

01:14:13.249 --> 01:14:14.416
Leroy.

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:19.254
Please don't do this. Please.

01:14:20.839 --> 01:14:23.383
You think I should
listen to her? Huh?

01:14:24.676 --> 01:14:26.469
What do you think?

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.472
Huh?

01:14:31.474 --> 01:14:33.225
Wanna know what I think?

01:14:34.727 --> 01:14:36.353
Kevlar is for pussies.

01:14:39.773 --> 01:14:41.483
This is for Frank.

01:15:09.509 --> 01:15:12.470
- My bag will make the flight?
- They'll run it down.

01:15:12.553 --> 01:15:15.556
- I just need to see your passport.
- Yeah.

01:15:20.102 --> 01:15:22.938
- I'm afraid there's been a mistake.
- What?

01:15:22.979 --> 01:15:25.315
No! No!

01:15:25.356 --> 01:15:28.443
Mr. Shurker most probably has yours.

01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:49.796
I told you, if Jerry makes it
and nothing gets funky, it'll be OK.

01:15:49.921 --> 01:15:53.382
- Well, shit got funky.
- Why isn't he here? Why? Why?

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:56.593
Give me a second,
I'm trying to get the story here.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:16:00.889
Take it easy and stop acting like a
kidnapped chick on a carton of milk.

01:16:05.185 --> 01:16:09.522
Hmm. Yeah, you're right.
This is an offer for the gun.

01:16:09.564 --> 01:16:11.524
Yeah. I can see how this looks.

01:16:11.649 --> 01:16:15.569
I've just been trying to get
some better numbers together.

01:16:15.653 --> 01:16:19.156
You have no intention
of giving the gun to Margolese.

01:16:20.282 --> 01:16:23.535
Look, Bobby.
You know, I know that you're loyal.

01:16:23.576 --> 01:16:27.372
That's good.
I mean, nobody's debating that.

01:16:27.413 --> 01:16:29.832
Let me ask you,
in your skulking around,

01:16:29.957 --> 01:16:33.169
going through private things
in people's offices,

01:16:33.210 --> 01:16:35.879
did you discover
that he's shutting us down?

01:16:35.963 --> 01:16:39.258
That's right. You, me, everybody.

01:16:39.258 --> 01:16:41.384
I don't... I don't understand.

01:16:41.468 --> 01:16:44.429
What, you didn't get the memo,
the bonus? No?

01:16:44.554 --> 01:16:47.515
No. Nothing.

01:16:47.557 --> 01:16:52.478
Me neither. Difference is I know
when I'm being fucked and you don't,

01:16:52.603 --> 01:16:55.939
cos you're standing
on the wrong fucking line.

01:16:57.691 --> 01:17:00.569
Let me help you get on
the right side of the line

01:17:00.652 --> 01:17:03.530
and do for you what
he should've done, Bobby.

01:17:07.575 --> 01:17:09.994
He's changed in prison.

01:17:10.036 --> 01:17:12.538
I'm telling you,
something's changed him.

01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:15.165
He's not the same guy.

01:17:15.291 --> 01:17:17.918
They're still holding.
What shall I tell 'em?

01:17:20.379 --> 01:17:23.006
Can I count on your co-operation?

01:17:23.006 --> 01:17:25.508
Yeah, yeah, Bobby. I'm here. Yeah.

01:17:28.594 --> 01:17:30.638
Yeah, that's his hotel.

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:34.683
Yeah, all right. Sure.

01:17:37.394 --> 01:17:39.771
- What?
- Plan B is now in effect.

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:42.857
I hope you don't get airsick.

01:18:13.969 --> 01:18:15.929
Get in the car.

01:18:20.017 --> 01:18:22.394
- Hola, señor.
- Hola, Señor Welbach.

01:18:22.435 --> 01:18:25.188
Has the US Consulate called back yet?

01:18:25.271 --> 01:18:26.731
No, sir, not yet.

01:18:26.731 --> 01:18:31.902
Look, this is a muy, muy important
call. I've lost my passport, OK?

01:18:31.944 --> 01:18:34.947
I'll be sitting right there.
I'm not gonna move.

01:18:34.989 --> 01:18:37.157
Do you see that man over there?

01:18:38.992 --> 01:18:40.452
Yeah.

01:18:40.535 --> 01:18:43.413
- That's Mr. Williamson.
- So?

01:18:43.496 --> 01:18:46.124
He's been waiting
for that very same call.

01:18:46.249 --> 01:18:49.794
Really? What, the whole morning?

01:18:49.794 --> 01:18:52.880
- Since March, señor.
- Oh, come on!

01:18:58.552 --> 01:19:00.470
Hotel de la Plaza.

01:19:00.554 --> 01:19:03.181
Yes, as a matter of fact,
he's right here.

01:19:03.223 --> 01:19:05.517
Señor, it's for you.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.561
Oh. Oh. Hey. Yes, hello?

01:19:08.686 --> 01:19:13.357
You bastard. Hello? Like, "Hello, my
life is great. Everything is fine. "

01:19:13.482 --> 01:19:15.901
- Sam?
- 'I thought you could be dead. '

01:19:15.943 --> 01:19:18.570
I was worried sick
and you answer "Hello,"

01:19:18.654 --> 01:19:21.198
like you're confirming
a room service order?!

01:19:23.033 --> 01:19:24.868
Sam? Sam?

01:19:24.951 --> 01:19:28.371
I'm done with Mr. Jerry Welbach.
Mr. "Hi". No, no.

01:19:28.496 --> 01:19:31.582
- 'Ask about the gun. '
- Is that Leroy?

01:19:31.582 --> 01:19:35.044
- 'Did he fucking touch you?'
- Do you have any idea

01:19:35.127 --> 01:19:37.129
what I have just been through?

01:19:37.171 --> 01:19:41.341
Multiply it by 1,000 and you'll have
a vague conception of where I'm at.

01:19:41.341 --> 01:19:45.178
Oh! Oh, isn't that typical, Jerry?
It's all a competition!

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:49.432
- Tit for tat, tat for tit...
- Stop yelling, for Christ's sake!

01:19:49.515 --> 01:19:51.976
How are you? Are you OK?
Are you all right?

01:19:52.059 --> 01:19:55.604
- 'Where are you?'
- Toluca airport, Jerry.

01:19:55.771 --> 01:19:58.190
And things are shitty, really shitty!

01:19:58.232 --> 01:20:01.151
Tell him if he shows up with
the pistol, it'll be OK.

01:20:01.276 --> 01:20:04.154
'He doesn't care.
He only cares about himself. '

01:20:04.195 --> 01:20:07.365
Why are you airing
personal matters with strangers?

01:20:07.448 --> 01:20:11.035
Oh, let me see. Uh, I don't think
that you really classify

01:20:11.118 --> 01:20:15.623
someone who you just perpetrated
a killing with a fucking stranger!

01:20:15.706 --> 01:20:18.959
And I can't find my Kotex cards
or my credit cards...

01:20:19.167 --> 01:20:20.669
Sam, what did you say?

01:20:20.752 --> 01:20:22.546
Jerry, just settle down.

01:20:22.587 --> 01:20:24.172
What'd you do to her?

01:20:24.297 --> 01:20:28.551
- Jerry, just settle down. OK?
- Yeah.

01:20:28.634 --> 01:20:31.137
We had a situation
but I'm a professional

01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:32.972
and I know what I'm doing.

01:20:33.097 --> 01:20:35.724
So why don't we chill out
a minute here?

01:20:35.808 --> 01:20:39.645
- 'Now, what happened? You get lost?'
- Yeah, five years ago.

01:20:39.728 --> 01:20:43.481
- What did you...? I can't hear you.
- No, nothing. Nothing.

01:20:43.523 --> 01:20:45.984
Nothing. I hope you have something.

01:20:46.067 --> 01:20:48.111
Yeah, you just... You don't...

01:20:48.277 --> 01:20:51.072
Make sure you return her
with all ten toes.

01:20:51.197 --> 01:20:53.616
- Huh?
- 'I understand. I understand. '

01:20:53.657 --> 01:20:57.578
'Just come down here, pick us up.
We'll square things away. '

01:20:57.703 --> 01:20:59.663
You got a very special woman here.

01:20:59.746 --> 01:21:02.666
But we all know
how you can get, right?

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:04.417
- 'So none of that. '
- What?

01:21:04.501 --> 01:21:07.378
This is a time for selflessness.

01:21:07.462 --> 01:21:10.590
What? Wha...?

01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:14.385
- You all right?
- Yeah, come on.

01:21:18.013 --> 01:21:19.931
Stupid gun.

01:21:26.146 --> 01:21:27.855
Out!

01:21:42.869 --> 01:21:45.330
I have to ask you a question.

01:21:46.873 --> 01:21:48.583
And it's an important one

01:21:48.666 --> 01:21:52.962
so I want you to think about the
answer before you give it to me, OK?

01:21:53.003 --> 01:21:54.880
OK.

01:21:55.923 --> 01:22:00.260
When two people really love each
other but they can't get it together,

01:22:00.385 --> 01:22:03.805
when do you get to that point
where enough is enough?

01:22:06.808 --> 01:22:09.393
That... Oh, well, that's...
You know?

01:22:09.477 --> 01:22:13.981
Um, you know it's over when...

01:22:14.023 --> 01:22:19.820
OK, I have, like, these psychosomatic
insomniatic manifestations of...

01:22:19.945 --> 01:22:22.113
Well, here's the thing about me.

01:22:22.155 --> 01:22:26.492
I'm a product of my emotions, not a
product of my environment, like him,

01:22:26.534 --> 01:22:31.122
which he is, exactly,
just that environmental...

01:22:31.163 --> 01:22:34.291
I- I need sunshine to grow.
That's who I am.

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:36.627
And with the projection of...

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:40.047
I have goals.

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:48.388
- That's your answer?
- Yeah.

01:22:53.184 --> 01:22:55.269
That's not right.

01:22:55.311 --> 01:22:58.772
I mean, there's a right answer here,
but that's not it.

01:23:04.361 --> 01:23:08.364
Look, in my business
you're surrounded...

01:23:08.406 --> 01:23:11.075
by loneliness and finality.

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:15.496
I don't care what your take is
on an afterlife,

01:23:15.621 --> 01:23:19.333
when people die, it's scary,
and they go alone.

01:23:21.168 --> 01:23:24.587
Now, the people that I send off,

01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:27.924
that have experienced love...

01:23:27.966 --> 01:23:30.092
They're a little less scared.

01:23:30.176 --> 01:23:33.721
They're still scared,
but there's a calmness to 'em.

01:23:33.804 --> 01:23:38.350
I think that comes from the knowledge
that somebody somewhere loved 'em

01:23:38.392 --> 01:23:40.811
and cared for 'em and will miss 'em.

01:23:42.938 --> 01:23:46.983
Now, I see that from time to time
and I am awed by it.

01:23:53.572 --> 01:23:57.326
I don't think I'd be telling you this
if it wasn't for Frank.

01:24:00.412 --> 01:24:02.789
Anyway, it's a loaded question.

01:24:02.831 --> 01:24:06.918
Look, when two people
love each other, totally, truthfully,

01:24:07.001 --> 01:24:09.420
all the way love each other,

01:24:09.462 --> 01:24:13.883
the answer to that question
is simple, especially in your case.

01:24:15.843 --> 01:24:19.346
When do you get to that point
where enough is enough?

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:20.972
Never.

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:24.184
Never.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.730
I just hope Jerry's not stupid.

01:24:50.208 --> 01:24:52.752
What is he driving?!

01:25:26.241 --> 01:25:28.284
It's a funky rental.

01:25:33.205 --> 01:25:36.125
I know we're all
a little grouchy right now.

01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:38.043
We'll get something to eat,

01:25:38.168 --> 01:25:41.671
you'll get the pistol
and then we'll go our separate ways.

01:25:41.797 --> 01:25:44.299
- Really separate ways.
- Don't start.

01:25:44.382 --> 01:25:46.926
Shut up.
I'll start because I have the...

01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:49.387
Why do you do that?
Do not tell me to shut up.

01:25:49.429 --> 01:25:51.389
- I count.
- We had an agreement.

01:25:51.472 --> 01:25:54.183
- Shut up.
- Why don't we all shut up a bit?

01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:58.020
- I swear, I will crash this car.
- Jerry, don't do that.

01:25:58.061 --> 01:26:02.148
I will. One more word out of you.
Another word, Sam. One more word.

01:26:02.274 --> 01:26:04.192
I swear to fucking God.

01:26:04.275 --> 01:26:05.944
Naugahyde.

01:26:05.944 --> 01:26:08.404
- All right.
- Jerry!

01:26:08.446 --> 01:26:09.989
- You finished?
- Yes!

01:26:10.072 --> 01:26:12.199
- You gonna shut up?
- Yes, yes, yes!

01:26:12.241 --> 01:26:14.618
Jerry, I will, I will!

01:26:20.207 --> 01:26:22.375
Stop the car, Jerry!
Stop the car.

01:26:26.296 --> 01:26:28.631
Stop, stop, stop!

01:26:28.673 --> 01:26:31.008
Oh, my God!

01:26:39.683 --> 01:26:41.726
Pendejo!

01:26:43.436 --> 01:26:45.980
Jerry... I want you to know,

01:26:46.022 --> 01:26:48.274
you're the craziest fuck I ever met.

01:26:51.861 --> 01:26:55.906
You know what? Go!
Go to Vegas. I've had it!

01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.018
Son of a bitch!

01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:29.353
I had a flat down in Florida once.

01:27:30.396 --> 01:27:32.398
Out in the middle of nowhere.

01:27:32.606 --> 01:27:36.985
So I go to the trunk,
there's no spare.

01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:40.822
Four hours in the baking sun,
waiting for a truck to come by.

01:27:41.865 --> 01:27:43.700
Ow!

01:27:43.742 --> 01:27:45.660
Now I always check.

01:28:06.179 --> 01:28:07.847
Let me give it a rip.

01:28:09.807 --> 01:28:13.769
Sometimes you need a little more
torque, you know what I mean?

01:28:14.812 --> 01:28:18.815
Wouldn't kill the bastards
to oil these every once in a while.

01:28:18.857 --> 01:28:20.817
Fucking car rentals.

01:28:20.859 --> 01:28:22.485
Yeah.

01:28:58.143 --> 01:29:00.854
- Walk away, baby.
- What did you do?

01:29:00.979 --> 01:29:02.772
He was gonna kill us.

01:29:02.814 --> 01:29:05.650
What the fuck did you do?
Look at his head!

01:29:05.692 --> 01:29:09.570
Stop! Stop! Listen, listen.
I met Leroy in 1997.

01:29:09.654 --> 01:29:12.031
- And that's not him!
- No, no, Jerry.

01:29:12.198 --> 01:29:14.200
You made a terrible mistake.

01:29:14.325 --> 01:29:17.536
He was my friend!
You made a terrible mistake!

01:29:17.661 --> 01:29:20.622
Baby, Leroy is black. Leroy's black.

01:29:21.998 --> 01:29:23.500
- OK?
- No.

01:29:23.541 --> 01:29:25.835
- Yes! He's black.
- No.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:28.421
African-American. A person of color.

01:29:28.504 --> 01:29:32.466
The guy he killed in Vegas is Leroy.
That's Margolese's Leroy.

01:29:32.591 --> 01:29:35.135
So, this guy...

01:29:35.177 --> 01:29:38.305
Oh, I'm such an ass.
Such an ass. Of course.

01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:42.642
"Give the gun to Leroy. He'll get it
down to Margolese. " Ha fuckin' ha!

01:29:42.684 --> 01:29:44.769
You see? Do you see?

01:29:44.811 --> 01:29:47.355
I'm being set up!

01:29:47.438 --> 01:29:50.858
Nayman hires this prick
to take out Leroy,

01:29:50.942 --> 01:29:54.778
get the gun and pin it all
on Jack-off Jerry.

01:29:54.862 --> 01:29:57.489
Isn't that right, Mr. Winston Baldry?

01:29:57.489 --> 01:30:01.159
I met Leroy and there's no way
you could have known that.

01:30:01.243 --> 01:30:04.537
And that's your mistake.
You fucked up.

01:30:21.428 --> 01:30:23.680
I can't believe it.

01:30:23.763 --> 01:30:26.933
Every fucking time.
Every fucking time, I fuck up.

01:30:26.975 --> 01:30:30.394
Not this time. This time, I win.

01:30:30.436 --> 01:30:32.605
This time, I win!

01:30:32.646 --> 01:30:35.441
I fucking win! I win!

01:30:42.113 --> 01:30:43.865
Oh, my God.

01:30:46.326 --> 01:30:49.245
I'm lucky I didn't
lose you three days ago.

01:30:53.457 --> 01:30:55.584
I wanna go home.

01:31:16.353 --> 01:31:20.190
Did you call about your passport?
Did you call the consulate?

01:31:20.232 --> 01:31:22.359
Yeah.

01:31:22.442 --> 01:31:24.527
Do you have enough money?

01:31:26.112 --> 01:31:28.031
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:13.697
I wanna ask you a question.

01:32:15.074 --> 01:32:17.159
It's a good one, so think about it.

01:32:29.921 --> 01:32:33.007
If two people love each other...

01:32:33.048 --> 01:32:36.885
but they just can't seem
to get it together...

01:32:40.347 --> 01:32:43.433
when do you get to that point
of enough is enough?

01:32:48.021 --> 01:32:49.230
Never.

01:33:32.937 --> 01:33:34.563
They'll call.

01:33:34.605 --> 01:33:37.941
I've left 60 messages.
I said it was an emergency.

01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:44.030
Why would Nayman ask you
if you like sex and travel?

01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:46.157
W- w-what is it supposed to mean?

01:33:46.241 --> 01:33:49.327
That you fool around or something?
Is that...

01:33:49.452 --> 01:33:53.247
I tell you the whole, long debacle
and this you have a problem with?

01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:56.208
Yeah, I do.
I think that when you ask someone

01:33:56.250 --> 01:33:59.378
who is involved
in a relationship of the heart

01:33:59.419 --> 01:34:03.548
if they like sex and travel, that...
that's m-m-mean-spirited.

01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:07.468
It's stupid. I'll tell you this,
we're not running any more, no.

01:34:07.593 --> 01:34:11.806
No, no. So done with the running.
The packing and the running and...

01:34:11.931 --> 01:34:14.725
Sooner or later,
that phone is gonna ring.

01:34:14.850 --> 01:34:17.352
We are going to get
your passport in order

01:34:17.436 --> 01:34:20.147
and you are gonna give the gun
to Margolese.

01:34:20.188 --> 01:34:23.566
Nayman is fucking Margolese.
That has nothing to do with us.

01:34:23.608 --> 01:34:25.819
By the grace of God,
I don't know what,

01:34:25.902 --> 01:34:29.363
you have managed to Forrest Gump
your way through this.

01:34:29.489 --> 01:34:32.533
And just, if we run now...

01:34:32.575 --> 01:34:35.411
we're gonna be running
the rest of our lives.

01:34:38.997 --> 01:34:40.999
We want our life back.

01:34:42.083 --> 01:34:44.002
Yes, baby, we do.

01:34:46.546 --> 01:34:49.632
No, that can't be right.
Can you just check again?

01:34:49.757 --> 01:34:52.009
Ow! Baby, don't. Margolese.

01:34:52.051 --> 01:34:54.220
M as in Mary.

01:34:54.303 --> 01:34:58.140
Baby, can you turn that down?
You don't even speak Spanish.

01:34:58.223 --> 01:35:01.643
Real emotion
transcends language, Jerry.

01:35:01.768 --> 01:35:04.646
You don't have to understand
to hear their pain.

01:35:04.729 --> 01:35:07.857
No, that's impossible. That's...

01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:11.777
Do you know when? Ay-yi-yi!

01:35:11.819 --> 01:35:13.737
No, no, all right. All right.

01:35:13.821 --> 01:35:17.116
Margolese is out.
He got out this morning. He's out.

01:35:17.241 --> 01:35:20.077
What's going on?
He's not due out till Thursday.

01:35:20.202 --> 01:35:22.829
It is Thursday, hon.

01:35:29.627 --> 01:35:32.129
- What is it?
- Shh. Come on.

01:35:32.254 --> 01:35:34.632
Just stay away from the window.

01:35:36.717 --> 01:35:38.719
Shit. Shit.

01:35:40.387 --> 01:35:42.847
Here, give me it.

01:35:44.891 --> 01:35:46.476
Good one.

01:35:54.733 --> 01:35:57.069
What is it, boy?

01:36:00.822 --> 01:36:02.449
Hey!

01:36:02.866 --> 01:36:04.367
Get out of there.

01:36:40.317 --> 01:36:42.694
Come on, man. You're freaking me out.

01:36:46.072 --> 01:36:47.156
Huh?

01:36:48.324 --> 01:36:50.493
Ow.

01:37:02.921 --> 01:37:05.131
Where are you taking me?

01:37:06.799 --> 01:37:10.136
It's not your fault
you know nothing about this gun.

01:37:10.261 --> 01:37:14.640
You're American.
This gun does not belong to you.

01:38:16.113 --> 01:38:17.656
Mr. Margolese.

01:38:22.327 --> 01:38:26.039
Well, I-I... I don't understand.

01:38:28.166 --> 01:38:30.126
What's it gonna take, Jerry?

01:38:30.167 --> 01:38:31.752
What?

01:38:31.919 --> 01:38:33.587
For the gun, Jerry.

01:38:33.671 --> 01:38:36.882
What's it gonna take for you
to give it to me and not to another?

01:38:38.967 --> 01:38:40.927
You... Man!

01:38:42.596 --> 01:38:44.347
What'll it take?

01:38:44.431 --> 01:38:48.142
I don't know what it takes.
I'm new in the "fuck you" business.

01:38:48.184 --> 01:38:52.271
- You tell me, what does it take?
- I didn't fuck you, Jerry.

01:38:52.396 --> 01:38:54.898
I had Nayman send you down here,

01:38:55.065 --> 01:38:57.985
but I didn't know
he was looking for a buyer.

01:38:57.985 --> 01:39:01.655
When I found out he was,
I didn't know who on my team was...

01:39:01.738 --> 01:39:04.532
still on my team,
or even if there was a damn team.

01:39:04.616 --> 01:39:08.161
Who...? Who the fuck are these guys?

01:39:08.244 --> 01:39:10.663
They work for this man, Tropillo.

01:39:10.788 --> 01:39:14.083
And who the fuck is Trop...?
You know? Not important.

01:39:14.208 --> 01:39:18.629
Give me a good reason why I shouldn't
fight to not give you the gun.

01:39:18.712 --> 01:39:21.089
If it comes to that,
someone will leave here

01:39:21.173 --> 01:39:24.509
missing an ear
or not being able to fuck any more.

01:39:24.634 --> 01:39:28.179
One reason, now that you let me know
what you think I'm made of.

01:39:33.267 --> 01:39:35.019
Are you a fatalist, Jerry?

01:39:35.144 --> 01:39:38.355
Uh, I never really thought about it.

01:39:40.065 --> 01:39:44.027
Por favor... Gracias.

01:39:47.238 --> 01:39:48.990
When you do think about it,

01:39:49.115 --> 01:39:54.286
about that afternoon you smashed
into my life, into my car,

01:39:54.411 --> 01:39:56.663
ever think there's anything to that?

01:39:58.165 --> 01:40:00.709
I honestly never thought about it.

01:40:02.627 --> 01:40:04.546
Because of that afternoon,

01:40:04.629 --> 01:40:08.549
I'm doomed to remember a backwards
inmate with a paper clipping.

01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:14.096
When you're in jail, a small box...

01:40:14.221 --> 01:40:17.891
you learn a lot about the fella
you're in a cage with.

01:40:20.727 --> 01:40:25.106
I grew to love that boy,
like he was my own son.

01:40:25.190 --> 01:40:27.317
But he was his.

01:40:29.652 --> 01:40:31.904
One day the boy came to me
with a clipping.

01:40:31.946 --> 01:40:36.158
"This is my destiny.
This is my birthright. "

01:40:36.241 --> 01:40:38.535
It was a story about the pistol...

01:40:38.535 --> 01:40:41.830
how they found it
in the mines, stashed away.

01:40:41.955 --> 01:40:44.833
When I asked why
it meant so much to him,

01:40:44.916 --> 01:40:47.585
the story he told changed my life.

01:40:50.630 --> 01:40:54.258
'The night
before the nobleman's arrival,

01:40:54.341 --> 01:40:59.137
'the assistant could not sleep...
his heart in aching pain. '

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.229
'The day was here when
the gunsmith would present

01:41:08.271 --> 01:41:10.356
'his gift to the nobleman.

01:41:18.363 --> 01:41:22.033
'The nobleman's son
was a notoriously vicious soldier,

01:41:22.158 --> 01:41:24.702
'worldly and wicked.

01:41:24.744 --> 01:41:29.332
'For him, his father demanded
something more beautiful,

01:41:29.415 --> 01:41:33.002
'more perfect than
he'd ever laid eyes on before.

01:41:33.085 --> 01:41:38.882
'But nothing, no words or description
could have given justice to it...

01:41:38.924 --> 01:41:42.385
'or have prepared him
for that gun's flawless grace.

01:41:45.013 --> 01:41:49.517
'When the nobleman's son
saw his intended bride-to-be...

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:51.769
'it was love at first sight.

01:41:58.150 --> 01:42:01.903
'The nobleman's son took
the mighty weapon into his hands.

01:42:02.028 --> 01:42:03.988
'A perfect fit. '

01:42:09.494 --> 01:42:11.245
'It did not work.

01:42:12.913 --> 01:42:16.250
'The nobleman took it as a bad omen.

01:42:16.333 --> 01:42:19.419
'The curse had rendered it useless
in unworthy hands.

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:26.134
'The gunsmith urged him to try it
one last time, and so he did. '

01:42:28.594 --> 01:42:32.681
'The nobleman was insulted by the
ineptness, angry with the gunsmith.

01:42:33.724 --> 01:42:35.768
'They argued.

01:42:45.527 --> 01:42:50.198
'When he realized that her heart
belonged to the simple assistant,

01:42:50.323 --> 01:42:53.826
'a man far less than he,
he was furious in anger.

01:42:55.744 --> 01:42:57.704
'He could not have that.

01:43:08.756 --> 01:43:12.718
'The assistant, realizing that
even if the gun should work,

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:16.472
'she would certainly die next,
begged his love to withdraw

01:43:16.555 --> 01:43:18.473
'and accept their fate. '

01:43:42.495 --> 01:43:45.915
'Some say you could actually
hear her heart break.

01:43:50.544 --> 01:43:54.757
'She fearlessly surrendered
her bitter spirit unto purgatory. '

01:43:57.593 --> 01:44:00.178
'The pistol contains
her damned soul. '

01:44:03.765 --> 01:44:07.644
Day after day I listened to that
story and always he'd tell me,

01:44:07.727 --> 01:44:11.314
"When I get out, I will find that
pistol and return it to my father,

01:44:11.355 --> 01:44:15.276
"whose father's father
had crafted the gun. "

01:44:17.569 --> 01:44:21.490
Eighteen months later,
he took it in the belly for me.

01:44:25.076 --> 01:44:26.995
He died.

01:44:31.207 --> 01:44:35.836
I vowed to search, acquire the
pistol and return it to his father.

01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:44.135
My grandson, Beck, headstrong boy...

01:44:45.261 --> 01:44:47.180
Sure, he was mixed up,

01:44:47.263 --> 01:44:51.600
he didn't understand the honor
behind what I was doing.

01:44:51.684 --> 01:44:55.854
That's when it became clear
I had to send you down here.

01:44:55.938 --> 01:44:59.524
Because you were the instrument
in the situation, Jerry.

01:45:05.405 --> 01:45:07.573
His son is dead.

01:45:07.657 --> 01:45:09.784
My grandson is dead.

01:45:10.826 --> 01:45:15.372
All of it brought together by
that afternoon at our intersection.

01:45:21.503 --> 01:45:23.588
Well, that...

01:45:23.630 --> 01:45:27.258
that's a pretty good fucking reason.

01:45:40.812 --> 01:45:43.523
Usted es un soldado de Dios.

01:45:43.565 --> 01:45:46.317
You are a soldier of God.

01:45:55.993 --> 01:45:58.662
She will be safe there, right there,

01:45:58.704 --> 01:46:01.498
and she can fly with the angels.

01:46:09.839 --> 01:46:13.134
No devils can catch her here,
right here,

01:46:13.217 --> 01:46:16.929
and now she will be able
to fly with the angels.

01:46:24.686 --> 01:46:26.187
We square?

01:46:27.563 --> 01:46:29.315
I'll owe you.

01:46:43.286 --> 01:46:44.704
Jerry, honey?

01:46:44.788 --> 01:46:47.665
'I bet this is the queen
of the idiot?

01:46:47.790 --> 01:46:50.960
'This must be Sam.
This is Bernie Nayman.

01:46:51.043 --> 01:46:54.922
'Where's that stupid fucking Jerry?
With Leroy?'

01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:58.926
Don't you mean Winston?

01:46:58.967 --> 01:47:00.927
I hope not, cos he's dead.

01:47:01.052 --> 01:47:03.305
'Then you're in a lot of trouble.

01:47:03.388 --> 01:47:05.890
'Especially if Jerry sold that gun. '

01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:11.354
- Jerry hid it.
- 'A step in the right direction.

01:47:13.856 --> 01:47:16.233
'Are you there, Sam?'

01:47:16.275 --> 01:47:18.527
Yeah, I'm here.

01:47:20.028 --> 01:47:21.905
Yeah, me too.

01:47:53.476 --> 01:47:54.852
Nayman!

01:47:54.935 --> 01:47:57.104
What have you done with her?

01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:01.358
Sam? Don't shoot. She's in the trunk.

01:48:01.399 --> 01:48:04.110
- I swear, if you hurt...
- It is hot in there.

01:48:04.235 --> 01:48:07.280
- Let her out!
- Give me the pistol and I will.

01:48:09.157 --> 01:48:13.035
All right. All right, Nayman,
where are the keys?

01:48:13.119 --> 01:48:15.245
I might have lost them.

01:48:15.329 --> 01:48:18.957
Well, you're out of luck.
She's the one who hid the pistol.

01:48:18.957 --> 01:48:20.751
Oh.

01:48:32.386 --> 01:48:34.305
Sam, no!

01:48:34.388 --> 01:48:37.474
- Put it down. You'll damage it.
- Shut the fuck up!

01:48:37.558 --> 01:48:41.019
Sam, do not, I repeat,
do not pull that trigger. No.

01:48:41.144 --> 01:48:43.396
I... I will pull
this fucking trigger.

01:48:43.521 --> 01:48:46.524
You toast that gun,
he's dead right after.

01:48:48.776 --> 01:48:50.111
Sweets.

01:48:52.571 --> 01:48:55.949
Put the gun down. OK?

01:48:56.033 --> 01:48:57.784
Put it down.

01:49:01.163 --> 01:49:03.123
I'm not worth it.

01:49:04.290 --> 01:49:05.375
OK?

01:49:08.002 --> 01:49:09.921
He's right, it's not worth it.

01:49:11.714 --> 01:49:14.008
Don't you know when enough is enough?

01:49:18.095 --> 01:49:19.888
Baby.

01:49:21.806 --> 01:49:23.933
Do you like sex and travel?

01:49:25.185 --> 01:49:27.979
As a matter of fact, I do.

01:49:28.062 --> 01:49:29.981
Wrong answer.

01:49:46.371 --> 01:49:47.705
Sweetheart?

01:50:16.482 --> 01:50:19.568
We just witnessed a miracle.

01:50:27.158 --> 01:50:29.744
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:50:30.995 --> 01:50:33.747
- Oh, my God.
- Are you OK?

01:50:33.831 --> 01:50:35.999
Am I OK? Yeah, I'm OK. You OK?

01:50:36.166 --> 01:50:37.876
Huh?

01:50:49.929 --> 01:50:53.140
- May I?
- It would be our honor.

01:51:07.654 --> 01:51:09.155
Yeah.

01:51:17.621 --> 01:51:19.373
Seal it.

01:52:13.672 --> 01:52:15.382
Do you love me, Jerry?

01:52:15.507 --> 01:52:17.801
I adore you, sweetheart.

01:52:17.843 --> 01:52:20.011
Then tell me it again.

01:52:20.053 --> 01:52:24.808
- I've already told you three times.
- Just one more time. Please. Please.

01:52:28.352 --> 01:52:32.690
The pistol was crafted for a
noble man by a poor Mexican gunsmith.

01:52:32.731 --> 01:52:34.400
- Nobleman.
- Hmm?

01:52:34.441 --> 01:52:37.194
- It's nobleman. One word.
- What did I say?

01:52:37.277 --> 01:52:39.071
What difference does it make?

01:52:39.237 --> 01:52:41.239
- It doesn't.
- Why correct me?

01:52:41.281 --> 01:52:44.784
- English is your mother tongue.
- I'm calling a time-out!

01:55:53.332 --> 01:55:55.125
Raoul!

01:58:08.748 --> 01:58:10.708
I love you, Jerry.
