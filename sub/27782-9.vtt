00:02.802 --> 00:05.238
{\an8}(Juliette)
These days, I feel
like everything

00:05.305 --> 00:06.673
{\an8}is just falling apart.

00:06.740 --> 00:07.974
{\an8}Did you have sex with
that girl?

00:08.041 --> 00:09.542
{\an8}I didn't do (bleep)!

00:09.609 --> 00:12.812
But I'm trying not to let
the rumors ruin my relationship.

00:12.879 --> 00:15.115
Here's the thing,
I don't want to know.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.216
Problem is,
it's ruining things

00:16.282 --> 00:18.585
between me and my best friends,

00:18.651 --> 00:20.286
{\an8}and between them
and Alex.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.288
{\an8}I really cherished
our relationship,

00:22.355 --> 00:23.923
and you've been
a piece of crap to me.

00:23.990 --> 00:26.993
{\an5}And I'm tired--

00:23.990 --> 00:26.993
Deflect. Deflect. Deflect.

00:27.060 --> 00:29.629
{\an8}Madisson's relationship
is falling apart, too.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.865
You know Tawni?
We exchanged numbers,

00:31.931 --> 00:35.502
{\an1}but now she's like texting me
at 2:00 in the morning.

00:35.568 --> 00:37.871
Ben's been doing damage control
to hold it together,

00:37.937 --> 00:40.173
but now that people
are talking...

00:40.240 --> 00:42.609
{\an7}Text about him giving me
the grand tour.

00:42.675 --> 00:45.645
...it's only a matter of time
for that guy.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.880
{\an8}And Pauly?

00:46.946 --> 00:49.416
His entire life
is falling apart.

00:49.482 --> 00:51.384
(Alex)
Paul got arrested.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.086
Lately, I've been wondering
how any of us

00:53.153 --> 00:57.323
are keeping it together.
And I guess the answer is...

00:57.390 --> 00:59.759
we're totally not.

{\an8}I went skydiving
this morning.

01:39.599 --> 01:40.900
{\an8}Oh, you did?

01:40.967 --> 01:43.102

{\an8}I love it.
It just reminds you

01:53.546 --> 01:56.082
{\an8}to appreciate
being alive.

01:56.149 --> 01:59.853
{\an7}Well, speaking of feeling
grateful to be alive,

01:59.919 --> 02:02.355
{\an7}after my conversation
last night.

02:02.422 --> 02:03.590
{\an8}What'd you do
last night?

02:03.656 --> 02:05.358
{\an8}I went over to
Alex's house.

02:05.425 --> 02:06.893
{\an9}Why?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.394
{\an5}Shut your mouth for
once in your life!

02:06.960 --> 02:08.394
There you go.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.963
{\an5}There you go.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.963
I'm talking.

02:10.029 --> 02:11.030
This is exactly why

02:11.097 --> 02:12.532
I don't ever want to
be your friend,

02:12.599 --> 02:13.733
{\an1}because you don't believe me,
you don't care.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.101
{\an1}Oh, you're not ending
this friendship.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.103
{\an5}I'm ending this friendship.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.103
No, I'm ending this.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.438
{\an1}I want nothing to do
with you.

02:18.505 --> 02:20.340
Amanda, I screamed
my head off at him.

02:20.406 --> 02:22.208
If I could high five you
right now, I would.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.443
{\an1}(laughing)

02:23.510 --> 02:26.412
{\an1}It started out
with me being like,

02:26.479 --> 02:29.549
{\an1}the Alex you are now
is not the Alex that I knew,

02:29.616 --> 02:33.219
{\an1}and you are not a good person.
Like, the way you talk

02:33.286 --> 02:35.388
{\an1}to everyone around you
is disgusting.

02:35.455 --> 02:37.991
{\an1}The way you treat
females is disgusting.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.159
{\an1}And honestly, the way
you treat Juliette

02:40.226 --> 02:41.327
is the worst of it all.

02:41.394 --> 02:42.595
Amen, dude.
I'm so happy

02:42.662 --> 02:44.197
you said all that stuff
to his face.

02:44.264 --> 02:47.667
{\an4}I'm tired of living
in Alex Kompo's world.
I'm over it.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.903
{\an5}I think we all are,
honestly.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.903
{\an1}Yeah.

02:49.969 --> 02:51.304
{\an1}But I think
we're all gonna do,

02:51.371 --> 02:53.006
{\an1}like, Sunday "Funday"
tomorrow.

02:53.072 --> 02:54.440
Okay.
Well...

02:54.507 --> 02:56.809
{\an1}I highly doubt Juliette's
gonna come tomorrow.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.746
{\an1}She's too embarrassed.
But I guarantee Alex comes,

02:59.812 --> 03:02.549
{\an1}because he thinks that after
that conversation with me,

03:02.615 --> 03:03.850
he's on his high horse.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.085
But, like, I just wanna
like have a good time.

03:06.152 --> 03:08.388
{\an1}I'm excited to, like,
get everybody together.

03:08.454 --> 03:09.689
You're excited?

03:09.756 --> 03:11.224
(bleep) gonna go down
and you know it.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.625
And you know I like that.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.294
Oh, my God.
I wonder if Juliette

03:14.360 --> 03:15.728
is ever gonna come to
her senses and be like,

03:15.795 --> 03:17.163
"Okay, yeah, he cheated."

03:17.230 --> 03:19.465
{\an1}My favorite line she says is,
"We're always good when

03:19.532 --> 03:21.401
{\an1}it's just him and I."
And I'm like--

03:21.467 --> 03:23.169
Fantastic. You guys stay
in your mansion alone

03:23.236 --> 03:25.204
{\an1}for the rest of your lives
and never talk to anybody else

03:25.271 --> 03:27.173
{\an5}just so you can be happy.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.173
{\an1}(laughing)
There you go.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.909
♪ Babe, a catastrophe ♪

03:29.976 --> 03:32.412

So, you excited?

03:36.816 --> 03:38.418
{\an7}(Alex)
I-- No, I'm not excited.

03:38.484 --> 03:41.120
{\an8}(Juliette)
The last time anyone saw
me and Alex together,

03:41.187 --> 03:42.655
{\an8}things got ugly.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.090
Tell me the truth.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.993
I'm not feeding into this.
I didn't do (bleep)!

03:47.060 --> 03:48.027
I didn't get caught!

03:48.094 --> 03:49.362
{\an5}You shut the (bleep) up!

03:48.094 --> 03:49.362
{\an3}Stop!

03:49.429 --> 03:50.997
And after the scene he made,

03:51.064 --> 03:54.300
I know everyone is wondering
what I'm still doing with him.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.569
{\an5}It's gonna be awkward.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.569
Yeah.

03:56.636 --> 03:58.037
{\an1}If it sucks,
can we just leave?

03:58.104 --> 04:00.139
Yeah. Just because there's
mean people out there

04:00.206 --> 04:02.208
doesn't mean like
we have to, like, hide.

04:02.275 --> 04:03.476
{\an1}Even your situation
with Chloe,

04:03.543 --> 04:05.678
{\an1}like, I don't know
what the deal is, but...

04:05.745 --> 04:07.046
{\an1}I just-- You know, I told her
I don't want to be

04:07.113 --> 04:08.715
her friend anymore.
I feel like

04:08.781 --> 04:12.852
she has constantly screwed
with our relationship.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.954
{\an1}They think it's cool to like
hate on our relationship,

04:15.021 --> 04:18.291
{\an5}'cause a lot of them
don't want to see us--

04:15.021 --> 04:18.291
{\an1}Okay, they're not hating
on our relationship.

04:18.358 --> 04:23.329
Like, something really bad
happened, you were doing.

04:23.396 --> 04:24.831
People are gonna like...

04:24.897 --> 04:28.835

That's a really
nice mic, right?

04:57.263 --> 04:58.331
This feels so real now.

04:58.398 --> 04:59.832
{\an1}Like, I can't believe
we're leaving.

04:59.899 --> 05:02.802
{\an7}Every show is gonna be
at least, like, 250 people.

05:02.869 --> 05:04.570
{\an7}Yeah.

05:02.869 --> 05:04.570
{\an8}It's not like huge.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.005
{\an5}It's not like a stadium.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.005
No, but that's amazing.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.540
(Juliette)
Brandon's been working hard

05:07.607 --> 05:09.142
to take his music to
the next level...

05:09.208 --> 05:10.977
{\an1}I used to, like,
do shows for, like, free.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.612
{\an1}If I just keep this up,
I can like

05:12.679 --> 05:14.180
{\an1}go on tour by
the end of the year.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.115
...and it's starting
to pay off.

05:16.182 --> 05:19.218
But it's hard because his
girlfriend is totally jealous.

05:19.285 --> 05:21.621
{\an5}(Alana)
Are you coming to
his Florida tour?

05:21.688 --> 05:24.223
No, actually, I'm not.
He never mentioned it,

05:24.290 --> 05:25.758
{\an5}so that's weird.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.758
{\an3}Oh.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.593
{\an1}You don't trust me, is
basically what you're saying.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.828
Let me know things
before I find out

05:28.895 --> 05:30.363
from someone that
I don't even know.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.965
{\an1}The other night, look,
I wanted to apologize, Alana,

05:33.032 --> 05:35.234
about, um, how Camilla
acted the other day.

05:35.301 --> 05:37.804
{\an4}It's cool, it's whatever.
I mean...

05:35.301 --> 05:37.804
{\an3}Yeah.

05:37.870 --> 05:41.841
We've been...
going through our, like,

05:41.908 --> 05:43.843
ups and downs
with jealousy and...

05:43.910 --> 05:45.812
{\an5}Right.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.812
You know, like,
I told her that

05:45.878 --> 05:47.313
I just can't
do this right now.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.681
{\an4}What?

05:47.380 --> 05:48.681
You know, we're not
together, you know?

05:48.748 --> 05:49.949
Called it quits.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.852
{\an7}I don't have time
for a relationship.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.620
{\an7}That's just how I feel about it,
and that's just how it is.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.823
{\an7}I just, like, can't say
I'm sorry enough.

05:58.791 --> 06:00.359
I mean, are you okay?

06:00.426 --> 06:02.295
{\an5}Yeah, I mean...

06:00.426 --> 06:02.295
{\an1}You obviously care about
each other, but...

06:02.361 --> 06:04.097
Wasn't the case. You know, I
still do care about the girl,

06:04.163 --> 06:06.232
{\an5}and I know she feels
the same, but...

06:04.163 --> 06:06.232
Right.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.633
But right now,
I guess, it's like

06:07.700 --> 06:08.968
at this point in
my career,

06:09.035 --> 06:10.369
at this point in life
in general,

06:10.436 --> 06:12.105
{\an5}it's just like...

06:10.436 --> 06:12.105
{\an1}Yeah.

06:12.171 --> 06:13.606
It just wasn't
working out the way, like,

06:13.673 --> 06:15.708
we both saw it to fit,
you know, and...

06:15.775 --> 06:17.410
Maybe it's better this way.

06:17.477 --> 06:19.846
{\an1}You got to find
the right person,

06:19.912 --> 06:21.314
{\an1}especially when
you're in a career

06:21.380 --> 06:22.448
that we want to pursue.

06:22.515 --> 06:23.883
{\an3}I feel you.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.084
{\an1}Just think of it like
you're focusing on

06:25.151 --> 06:27.386
{\an5}more important things now.

06:25.151 --> 06:27.386
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

06:27.453 --> 06:30.923
I'm just happy that...
right after this happened,

06:30.990 --> 06:32.091
there's something to
look forward to,

before anything has happened

22:45.664 --> 22:47.666
So we drove out to
catch up with Brandon's tour.

22:47.733 --> 22:49.634
A different town,
cute dresses,

22:49.701 --> 22:53.038
a night out
sounds perfect right now.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.506
(Alana)
Hey!

22:54.573 --> 22:57.075
Oh, mommy!
What up, guys?

22:57.142 --> 22:59.778
There they go!
What up, Juliette?

22:59.845 --> 23:01.947
{\an5}How you doing?
Thanks so much
for coming out.

23:02.013 --> 23:04.483
{\an8}Madisson, you look
(bleep) beautiful.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.118
{\an7}You're awesome.
Thank you!

23:06.184 --> 23:08.520
{\an5}Thank you so much
for coming out.

23:06.184 --> 23:08.520
This is a big deal.

23:08.587 --> 23:11.957
{\an1}This is big!
This is big deal!

23:12.023 --> 23:14.659
Where's Camilla?

23:14.726 --> 23:16.628
{\an5}Is she here?

23:14.726 --> 23:16.628
Well, to be honest,

23:16.695 --> 23:18.263
we're not together anymore.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.465
Since when?

23:20.532 --> 23:22.267
{\an3}Recently.

23:22.334 --> 23:23.735
{\an6}You know...

23:22.334 --> 23:23.735
Are you okay?

23:23.802 --> 23:25.637
I'm fine.
I'm-I'm clear-headed

23:25.704 --> 23:27.606
{\an5}and I'm ready to perform.

23:25.704 --> 23:27.606
Okay. Okay.

23:27.672 --> 23:29.608
Did Ben come out tonight?

23:29.674 --> 23:32.210
{\an1}No. We-We-We-We made it
a girls' night.

23:32.277 --> 23:33.879
{\an5}But you're gonna do great.

23:32.277 --> 23:33.879
All right. All right.

23:33.945 --> 23:35.147
You got this.

23:37.182 --> 23:38.750
Thank you so much for
coming out, Madisson.

23:38.817 --> 23:40.018
{\an5}It means the most.

It is so windy out here.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.889
{\an5}It feels good.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.889
I mean, it's windy
out here,

24:50.956 --> 24:52.891
but it honestly feels better
than inside. It's so hot.

24:52.958 --> 24:55.293
{\an5}Than inside where
it's hot. Yeah.

24:52.958 --> 24:55.293
It's so loud.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.795
{\an1}They, like,
vibe really well.

24:56.862 --> 24:58.063
{\an5}Really well, yeah.

24:56.862 --> 24:58.063
They really do.

24:58.129 --> 24:59.698
{\an5}They look so good together.

24:58.129 --> 24:59.698
{\an1}They do.

24:59.764 --> 25:01.433
{\an1}Like, they could be, like,
an album cover, right?

25:01.499 --> 25:04.169
{\an6}I know!

25:01.499 --> 25:04.169
I know, right?
They have this, like, swag.

25:04.236 --> 25:07.072
{\an4}I've only heard them on,
like, a track before.
I've never heard them live.

25:07.138 --> 25:08.740
It would make sense
that you haven't.

25:08.807 --> 25:11.142
You don't want to go to all
your ex's shows. Like, yeah.

25:11.209 --> 25:12.711
{\an5}Well, I'm here now.

25:11.209 --> 25:12.711
Only this one.

25:12.777 --> 25:14.546
I'm here now, aren't I?

25:14.613 --> 25:17.215
Okay, so what's going on
with Ben?

25:17.282 --> 25:18.884
{\an1}Ugh. Okay.

25:18.950 --> 25:23.355
{\an1}So, at Motorworks,
um, Tawni came up to me

25:23.421 --> 25:29.561
{\an1}and told me that they've been
talking in some ways

25:29.628 --> 25:31.496
{\an1}that, like,
weren't appropriate.

25:31.563 --> 25:32.864
{\an3}Like, how?

25:32.931 --> 25:35.200
{\an1}She used the word
"sexting" specifically.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.002
{\an3}Oh, really?

25:35.267 --> 25:37.002
{\an1}Yeah.

25:37.068 --> 25:38.803
So, what do you think of it?

25:38.870 --> 25:40.472
{\an1}I-I don't know
this girl.

25:40.538 --> 25:41.640
{\an5}I know Ben.

25:40.538 --> 25:41.640
Yeah.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.408
And so, I do trust him

25:43.475 --> 25:45.610
and I'm gonna trust him
always before some girl

25:45.677 --> 25:47.379
I do not know.

25:49.347 --> 25:52.684
I honestly hate disagreeing
with you on this,

25:52.751 --> 25:56.788
but I just feel like
Tawni is not the liar.

25:56.855 --> 25:59.190
Tawni has proof.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.596
Are you kidding me?

26:04.663 --> 26:06.798
I've seen it
with my own eyes.

26:08.867 --> 26:10.001
{\an8}(Juliette)
Coming up...

26:10.068 --> 26:11.937
{\an8}It's a felony.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.937
{\an9}Dear God.

26:12.003 --> 26:15.206
{\an8}What is wrong with you?
I've had enough.

26:20.512 --> 26:21.646
(Chloe)
So what do you think of it?

26:21.713 --> 26:24.249
{\an1}I-I don't know this girl.
I know Ben.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.384
Tawni has proof.

26:26.451 --> 26:28.520
Are you kidding me?

26:28.586 --> 26:31.189
I've seen it
with my own eyes.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.757
I've seen some
text messages.

26:32.824 --> 26:34.659
{\an1}Like what?

26:32.824 --> 26:34.659
{\an3}Sexting.

26:34.726 --> 26:37.162
{\an5}Let me see this.

26:34.726 --> 26:37.162
Yeah, go for it.

26:37.228 --> 26:39.364
{\an1}What?

26:39.431 --> 26:42.634
{\an1}Wait, wait...
Tawni has proof of Ben?

26:42.701 --> 26:45.303
Yeah. 100%.

26:45.370 --> 26:47.405
I've seen it with
my own eyes.

26:47.472 --> 26:51.142
Ben to Tawni,
back and forth.

26:51.209 --> 26:54.179
Ben is definitely
flirting back.

26:54.245 --> 26:55.780
This sucks.

26:55.847 --> 26:57.248
Yeah, it does suck.

26:57.315 --> 26:59.250
{\an1}I don't know Tawni.
I know Ben.

26:59.317 --> 27:01.152
{\an1}I'm dating Ben
and I trust Ben.

27:01.219 --> 27:04.456
You're only bashing Tawni
and, like, I'm telling you--

27:04.522 --> 27:06.458
{\an1}Because I owe it to Ben.
He is my boyfriend.

27:06.524 --> 27:09.127
{\an1}And I owe it to him
to trust him over anyone else.

27:09.194 --> 27:10.662
Ben is obviously
lying to you.

27:10.729 --> 27:12.664
Tawni was willing
to tell you the truth.

27:12.731 --> 27:15.333
And you're only here
coming for Tawni.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.801
Of course I'm not
gonna trust Tawni

27:16.868 --> 27:18.203
{\an1}and of course I'm not
gonna want to hear that

27:18.269 --> 27:20.205
from some girl I don't know.

27:20.271 --> 27:22.273
It's 'cause you don't
wanna believe it.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.876
Trust me.
I had it worse.

27:24.943 --> 27:28.580
{\an1}But does it really matter where
it came from if it's true?

27:30.782 --> 27:32.817
I just don't want you
only freaking out on Tawni

27:32.884 --> 27:34.519
{\an5}and then not holding
Ben accountable.

27:32.884 --> 27:34.519
{\an3}Yeah.

27:34.586 --> 27:36.488
Look, if it's true with Ben,
you're right, you're right.

27:36.554 --> 27:38.056
{\an5}I'm just telling you.

27:36.554 --> 27:38.056
{\an1}And I'm not mad at you.
I'm sorry.

27:38.123 --> 27:39.424
I've seen it
with my own eyes,

27:39.491 --> 27:42.861
him literally in quotes,
"Hi, hottie."

27:42.927 --> 27:46.064
That's not appropriate
when you have a girlfriend.

27:46.131 --> 27:47.999
{\an3}No.

27:48.066 --> 27:50.735
You're okay.

27:50.802 --> 27:53.004
I don't want you
to be upset.

27:53.071 --> 27:54.672
{\an1}Sucks.

27:54.739 --> 27:57.675
{\an1}This means that you need to
have a conversation with Ben.

27:57.742 --> 28:00.045
{\an1}But now, like, I-- like,
I don't even know

28:00.111 --> 28:01.312

28:30.942 --> 28:32.877
I was just with your dad

28:32.944 --> 28:35.313

{\an6}Oh, no.

28:44.489 --> 28:46.558

down to intervene

28:46.624 --> 28:48.426
{\an1}and put an end
to this behavior.

28:48.493 --> 28:50.195
And she told him.
Like, I heard it.

28:50.261 --> 28:51.863
She's gonna cut him off.

28:51.930 --> 28:54.399
{\an4}He gets, like, 1,000,
2,000 bucks a week.
Like, a lot of money.

28:54.466 --> 28:57.102
{\an1}That's his rent.
That's how he eats.

28:57.168 --> 28:58.870
{\an1}I'm worried for him,
for sure,

28:58.937 --> 29:01.172
{\an1}but at this point,
it's the least of my worries.

29:01.239 --> 29:04.976
{\an1}I got, like, so much Juliette
drama right now, and...

29:05.043 --> 29:06.644

with you all?

29:06.711 --> 29:08.980
{\an1}Well, (bleep) really hit

29:09.047 --> 29:10.315
{\an3}Oh.

29:10.381 --> 29:12.484
{\an1}Juliette broke up
with me a few weeks back,

29:12.550 --> 29:15.019
{\an1}but this time, like,
really feels like

29:15.086 --> 29:16.855
{\an1}she's actually gonna
go through with it and--

29:16.921 --> 29:20.158
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe it.

29:20.225 --> 29:21.693

now with this?

29:21.759 --> 29:24.496
{\an4}Uh, ah...

29:21.759 --> 29:24.496
You need to figure out

29:24.562 --> 29:28.099
how to always be truthful
and faithful

29:28.166 --> 29:29.767
{\an5}in your relationship.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.767
I mean, I am being truthful.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.636
{\an1}I don't need you to accuse me
like everyone else is.

29:31.703 --> 29:34.038
{\an1}No, but I'm not accusing you.
It just doesn't look good.

29:34.105 --> 29:37.909
{\an4}Trust me.
If I wanted to hook up
with other girls, I could.

29:37.976 --> 29:39.344
It's the same old story.

29:39.410 --> 29:41.746
It's the same old story,
so I-- I don't know.

29:41.813 --> 29:44.616
{\an1}Maybe y'all do need a break.
Maybe you really do.

29:45.917 --> 29:48.019
I'm just not ready
to give up on her.

29:49.420 --> 29:50.755

{\an1}that you're even over here
if he finds out.

39:19.290 --> 39:21.525
Oh, I think he will.
But I kind of, like,

39:21.592 --> 39:24.862
{\an1}need him to just understand,
like, I really don't like

39:24.929 --> 39:26.564
when, like, people try
and tell me

39:26.630 --> 39:28.966
who I can't talk to.
It really pisses me off.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.267
I don't know.

39:30.334 --> 39:31.769
{\an1}Like, Juliette,
she'd assume the worst.

39:31.836 --> 39:33.537

39:31.836 --> 39:33.537
Yeah, it's-- I don't know.

39:33.604 --> 39:34.972
It's like she would
automatically assume

39:35.039 --> 39:37.308
that, like, we're (bleep)
skinny-dipping in the pool

39:37.374 --> 39:39.210

talking about you.

39:41.145 --> 39:43.781

like, they're not here
so they don't know.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.253

how much I actually,
like, did care about Juliette,

39:49.320 --> 39:50.654
because a lot of the emotions

39:50.721 --> 39:52.156
{\an1}were covered up
with bull(bleep).

39:52.223 --> 39:53.891
{\an1}And, like, I don't ever
get bored of her.

39:53.958 --> 39:56.427
Like, I used to have,
like, chicks and stuff

39:56.494 --> 39:58.429
{\an1}that I'd be like, "Dude,
can you just go home?"

39:58.496 --> 40:00.564
{\an1}Like, I have girls bait me
and be like, "All right, yeah,

40:00.631 --> 40:02.066
{\an1}"like, just take me
to my house.

40:02.133 --> 40:03.734
{\an1}"Like, drop me off.
Like, all right,

40:03.801 --> 40:05.669
{\an4}I'm just gonna run
in real quick and get
my hair straightener."

40:05.736 --> 40:07.738
{\an4}I'm like, "Dude, can you
just go home for, like,
five hours, please?"

40:07.805 --> 40:10.107
{\an6}Right.

40:07.805 --> 40:10.107
{\an1}Like, stop, like,
breathing down my neck.

40:10.174 --> 40:12.176
{\an1}Her, like,
I never get bored of.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.644
Where there's no,
like, separation.

40:13.711 --> 40:15.346
{\an1}And maybe that's some
of the reason why we fight too,

40:15.412 --> 40:17.782
{\an4}'cause we're just, like,
always breathing down
each other's necks.

40:17.848 --> 40:19.750
So you would consider this
right now a break?

40:19.817 --> 40:23.154
This isn't you,
like, done with her?

40:23.220 --> 40:25.122
{\an1}(sighs)
I don't know.

40:25.189 --> 40:26.624
{\an1}I feel like
I'm broke up and, yes,

40:26.690 --> 40:28.759
{\an1}I'm free to do what I want.
Not fair to me to--

40:28.826 --> 40:31.529
{\an5}Just keep it in your pants
for a little.

40:28.826 --> 40:31.529
{\an1}(chuckles)

40:31.595 --> 40:33.430
{\an3}No, really.

40:31.595 --> 40:33.430
Uh, I know.

40:33.497 --> 40:35.432
Like, is it that hard?

40:37.735 --> 40:40.304
Were you trying to get
her back, or not really?

40:42.239 --> 40:44.809
{\an1}Part of me wants
to get her back, yes,

40:44.875 --> 40:46.710
but I don't know.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.846
{\an1}What I really want back
is, like, the girl

40:48.913 --> 40:50.748
that once did trust me.

40:50.815 --> 40:53.184
{\an8}I don't think that girl
is ever coming back,

40:53.250 --> 40:54.952
{\an8}the one that trusted you.

40:55.019 --> 40:57.755
{\an8}I hate to say it.
Like, this is probably,

40:57.822 --> 41:01.458
{\an8}like, too broken to ever
be back to how she was.

41:01.525 --> 41:04.295
{\an8}♪ Got me high in the back
of your mind ♪

41:04.361 --> 41:05.362
{\an8}♪ And I don't think
I'll make it out alive ♪♪
