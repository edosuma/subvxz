Come on!
Are you kidding me?

00:06.540 --> 00:08.176
What are you, blind?

00:08.242 --> 00:10.878
Ken, you screaming isn't gonna
change the score.
I don't care!

00:10.944 --> 00:14.115
David Arquette's Waltz
was clearly
the dance of the night!

00:16.284 --> 00:18.352
Hey!

00:18.419 --> 00:21.522
Mother, Father,
thank you so much for coming.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.491
To our living room?

00:23.557 --> 00:25.226
Please just relax.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.461
Dave!

00:27.528 --> 00:29.029
Um,
what is this about?

00:29.097 --> 00:30.464
Warm snickerdoodle?
All right.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.633
Don't doodle it, Allison.
It's a trap.

What is it that unites
all humans?

00:38.939 --> 00:40.408
Money. No, power.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.742
Love?
Now, think before you speak.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.611
Chocolate! The Olympics!

00:43.677 --> 00:46.514
What unites all humans
is their need
to carry things.

00:46.580 --> 00:47.715
Damn.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.217
Hunters and gatherers
were nothing

00:49.283 --> 00:52.153
without something
to carry what they, well...

00:52.220 --> 00:53.421
Hunted and gathered.

00:56.724 --> 01:01.061
On this piece of paper,
you will find
what you call a backpack,

01:01.129 --> 01:03.797
what I call
a dream catcher.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.466
Molly, we're not gonna be
swayed by...

01:05.533 --> 01:07.000
Wow, that is a beautiful bag.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.737
Right?
It's a Gordon Ruby.

01:09.803 --> 01:13.107
Okay, so how much
is catching dreams
gonna set us back?

01:13.174 --> 01:15.109
It's on the other side
of your handout,

01:15.176 --> 01:17.778
but what is a price, really?
(CHUCKLES)

01:17.845 --> 01:19.180
Okay, thank you
for the cookie.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.116
Dad, I know it
seems expensive,

01:22.183 --> 01:24.218
but it'll last forever.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.387
This costs more than
my first car.

01:26.454 --> 01:27.988
No way.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.490
But this isn't fair!

01:29.557 --> 01:30.924
You want to know about
not fair?

01:30.991 --> 01:32.860
Call David Arquette.
He'll tell you.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.730
Look, it is not my fault
you settled in an
affluent area

01:36.797 --> 01:39.867
where something like
the brand of your backpack
doesn't go unnoticed.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.203
We are so sorry
for imprisoning you

01:42.270 --> 01:44.605
in this upper middle class
Neo-Tuscan hell hole.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.108
Mom.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.344
Allison...
Can I call you Allison?

01:50.411 --> 01:51.845
It's a "no"
From both of us.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.186
You were only supposed
to throw the confetti
if they said yes.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.188
That's why I wanted
a dress rehearsal.

02:09.563 --> 02:12.700
Okay, I am not saying
I want to go to prison.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.335
I am just saying,

02:14.402 --> 02:18.071
it would be nice to have
that much time to read.

02:19.573 --> 02:22.576
Clark, we all have
prison fantasies.

by all the gangs.

02:28.115 --> 02:30.484
Oh, Pat, I've got to leave
a little early tonight.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.586
Before you tell me
the reason, no.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.356
It's important.
I have dinner plans.
My sister's in town.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.724
Oh, Dr. Wendi's in town?

02:36.790 --> 02:38.759
Yep.
Wait, Dr. Wendi?

02:38.826 --> 02:41.195
The Dr. Wendi from
the Dr. Wendi show?

02:41.262 --> 02:42.863
The star of my dream
where I'm sick

02:42.930 --> 02:45.333
and my doctor's Dr. Wendi,
Dr. Wendi?

02:45.399 --> 02:47.134
Yes, that Dr. Wendi.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.237
You know my sister's show?
Yeah!

02:49.303 --> 02:52.540
I used to watch it every day
when I lived in Buffalo.

02:52.606 --> 02:55.243
Sorry to city drop like that,
but I lived in Buffalo.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.580
Yeah, I guess they're shooting
in LA. This week or...

02:59.647 --> 03:01.849
Yes, because they just became
nationally syndicated.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.918
Oh, that's...
Your sister has
a national television program?

03:04.985 --> 03:06.887
Oh, yeah. It's huge.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.889
Okay,
I'll tell you what.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.225
You can go early if
you get your sister
to plug the clinic.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.327
Fine. The four people
who watch her show

03:13.394 --> 03:15.729
will hear all about
Welltopia.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.030
I watch it.
I know.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.499
I was counting you
and your three cats.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.702
(LAUGHS)
That's a good one.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.106
I just can't believe
that you and Dr. Wendi
are related.

03:26.173 --> 03:29.477
She is so compassionate
and witty and warm,

03:29.543 --> 03:32.079
and you, uh...

03:32.145 --> 03:34.548
You took it
a different way.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.184
So, what's it like
having her as a sister?

03:37.251 --> 03:39.520
Well, to be honest,
she used to be a bit
of a hot mess.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.723
After college,
she lived in an airstream
trailer in Santa Cruz

03:42.790 --> 03:44.091
with some old
hippie dude, Dax.

03:44.157 --> 03:45.726
Not a fragrant man.
(CHUCKLES)

03:46.460 --> 03:47.628
So, what happened?

03:47.695 --> 03:49.430
Well, my parents
were freaked out.

03:49.497 --> 03:51.565
I brought her back to LA,
treated her dreadlocks
for lice,

03:51.632 --> 03:52.833
and helped her apply
to med school.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.936
You are such
a good big brother.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.038
I just grow
where I'm planted.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.609
Okay, one question.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.677
Would it be cool
if I came to dinner?

04:03.744 --> 04:05.446
No.
Got it.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.215
Unrelated question,

04:08.282 --> 04:10.050
where is the dinner?

04:16.256 --> 04:17.458
Good evening, Dr. Park.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.026
Welcome back
to Apple Bushel.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.929
Thanks so much.
I appreciate you saving us
our usual table.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.031
Do you have change
for a $2?

04:24.097 --> 04:26.567
Oh, no, please.
Your sister
already tipped me.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.669
She got here first
and requested this table.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.571
Hello, hello, hello!

04:30.638 --> 04:31.739
Hey!

04:31.805 --> 04:33.006
(BOTH LAUGH)

04:33.073 --> 04:34.174
Wen-Wen!

04:34.241 --> 04:35.776
Allison, you sexy bitch.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.545
I love this dress.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.414
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm not around kids
very much.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.882
But you guys
are sexy bitches, too.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.186
Good to see you,
Aunt Wendi.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.022
Sorry I had
to switch tables.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.658
I can't sit
by the door anymore.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.959
People keep
coming up to me.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.594
It just ruins the meal
for everyone.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.262
People keep
coming up to you?

04:55.329 --> 04:57.598
What, like the busboys?
They're just refilling
your water, Wendi.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.832
(LAUGHS)

04:58.899 --> 05:00.468
Oh, my God,
you are just blowing up.

05:01.535 --> 05:04.438
Mom, Dad,
thanks for making the trip.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.341
How was the drive?
No drive.
Wendi send Uber car.

05:07.408 --> 05:10.143
Uber Black.

05:10.210 --> 05:13.146
Okay, um, well,
tonight's the
prime rib meal deal,

05:13.213 --> 05:15.048
which I highly recommend.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.950
The baked potato's
a dollar more,

05:17.017 --> 05:18.452
but it's delicious.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.521
Sometimes you got
to live a little.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.791
You really sold it.
I'm in.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.695
You know what?
Everyone get the
baked potato tonight.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.129
Dinner is on me.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.664
ALL: Oh!

05:30.731 --> 05:32.165
Oh. Baller alert.
(CHUCKLES)

05:33.100 --> 05:34.301
Oh, hey, guys,

05:34.368 --> 05:36.604
did you get the video of me
emceeing the HMO banquet?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.506
So clever.
So talented.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.308
Yes, I am.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.644
You know, I just taped
a little comedy sketch
for Jimmy Kimmel.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.413
Oh, the fat Jimmy?

05:45.479 --> 05:46.714
Oh, he's the funny one.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.315
That is so cool.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.751
Wendi,
you really big deal.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.986
Yeah, so work's good,

05:53.053 --> 05:55.956
and, uh, you know,
I'm taking my
med school degree

05:56.023 --> 05:57.958
and applying it
to save lives.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.728
Like, front line.
Boots on the ground.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.732
Aunt Wendi,
can I take a selfie
with you?

06:04.798 --> 06:06.333
My friends will go crazy.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.836
(SQUEALS)
I want one, too,

06:08.902 --> 06:10.303
just in case
I make friends.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.743
Oh, you are gonna
make friends

06:15.809 --> 06:17.745
when you post
this awesomeness.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.481
Allison, get that
pilates-toned ass in here.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.950
I've only been twice,
but I really think
it's working.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.787
Come on, grandma, grandpa,
DAVE: Get in here.

06:29.256 --> 06:32.125
Ken.
Okay, fine.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.861
Wendi can't reach.
You take selfie.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.232
Okay...

06:40.501 --> 06:41.769
(ALL CHEERING)

06:41.835 --> 06:43.170
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.473
Ken.
Yeah?

06:45.539 --> 06:47.140
Take one from my phone.

06:50.578 --> 06:53.013
WENDI: I fly
all over the world.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.583
I did a nutrition workshop
at the White House.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.885
My TV show just hit
the five million viewer mark.

06:57.951 --> 07:01.021
I'm like,
"how is this
happening to me?"

07:01.088 --> 07:02.990
Yeah, well, recently,
Welltopia was rated

07:03.056 --> 07:06.259
the number-3 HMO
in the San Fernando Valley.

07:07.961 --> 07:11.098
And I was also like,
"how is this happening
to me?"

07:12.165 --> 07:13.467
So, I get it.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.569
This is all so amazing.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.238
When I first met you,
I did not think
you'd end up here.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.007
Me neither.
To Wendi.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.709
And...
Her show.

07:24.478 --> 07:27.347
(SPEAKING IN KOREAN)

07:28.649 --> 07:31.251
Seriously?
Korean?

07:31.318 --> 07:33.654
I picked up a little
on a syndication tour
of Korea.

07:33.721 --> 07:34.822
I wanted to surprise you.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.225
They flew you to Korea
for free?

07:38.291 --> 07:40.494
I want to be a TV doctor.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.630
You just
have to study hard.
Ish...

07:44.364 --> 07:46.800
Well, I'm trying
to excel in school,

07:46.867 --> 07:49.269
but my parents keep
stacking the deck against me

07:49.336 --> 07:51.772
by not getting me
a Gordon Ruby backpack.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.240
Oh, I'll give you one.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.509
Really?
I have a closet
full of them.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.511
People send me crazy stuff
for free all the time.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.613
I'm like, "what?"

07:59.680 --> 08:01.481
Oh, my God!
So generous.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.016
Really great of you.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.252
Look, we don't need
your charity backpack, okay?

08:05.318 --> 08:06.453
Huh?

08:07.054 --> 08:08.922
Because...

08:08.989 --> 08:11.291
I'm getting her one,
you know?

08:11.358 --> 08:13.060
Oh, my God,
that's so generous.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.928
Really cool of me.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.229
Seriously?

08:16.296 --> 08:17.998
Well, I just like
to get the kids

08:18.065 --> 08:20.067
a little something
when I come to town.

08:20.133 --> 08:23.170
I've been taken with that
crumb sweeper all night.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.339
It's yours.
No, no, no.

08:26.406 --> 08:29.376
I'm getting him
the crumb sweeper, too.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.580
Geez, how do you say
"thanks for ruining
all the surprises" in Korean?

08:32.646 --> 08:34.314
(SPEAKING IN KOREAN)

08:34.381 --> 08:35.916
How long were you there?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.892
Hey, how was dinner
with your sis?

08:44.958 --> 08:46.760
Did she pay?
Of course she paid.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.395
For the first time ever.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.731
Wow, you are incredible.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.666
If I had a famous sister
like Dr. Wendi,

08:52.733 --> 08:54.868
I would be so jealous,

08:54.935 --> 08:57.805
and yet you are just
glaring at me.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.609
You know, what's there
to be jealous of?

09:01.675 --> 09:03.777
She's just a mid-level
television personality

09:03.844 --> 09:05.212
who nobody even knows...

09:05.278 --> 09:06.546
Oh, my God,
it's Dr. Wendi!

09:06.614 --> 09:09.683
(GASPS) Oh, my God.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.285
Can I have your autograph?

09:12.352 --> 09:15.455
This is someone's
discharge papers.

09:15.522 --> 09:16.957
Two birds, one stone.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.996
Girl, I got to admit,
I didn't love you
at first,

09:23.063 --> 09:25.132
but you have grown on me,

09:25.198 --> 09:26.900
and he has shrunk on me.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.502
Dr. Wendi,
hi, I'm Pat Hein.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.039
I'm the Medical Director here
at Welltopia Woodland Hills,

09:32.105 --> 09:35.208
and we would just love it
if you could do
a segment on us.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.945
Well, I guess
I could do something
about the sad state

09:38.011 --> 09:40.714
of mid-level
corporatized medicine.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.249
Name the day.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.954
So, what are
you doing here?

09:47.020 --> 09:48.856
I wanted to come by
and apologize.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.058
I feel like
I overstepped last night
with the backpack.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.393
And the crumb sweeper.
Yeah.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.128
Dave's turning out weird,
huh?

09:55.195 --> 09:57.965
Yeah, we're keeping
an eye on it.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.067
We are shooting
our last episode
here tomorrow,

10:00.133 --> 10:03.103
and I wanted to ask you
to come and be on the show.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.905
We have a lot of doctors on
as consultants.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.606
Oh, really?

10:06.674 --> 10:08.575
Wow, I haven't
watched it yet.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.110
You know,
busy Schedge.
Please.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.680
You watch Judge Mathis
In your office every day.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.349
We just need
a quick sound bite.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.018
Mom and dad are coming.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.954
It would be really great
to have my big bro on.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.223
I don't know.
You have to do it.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.326
You've always said
that you dreamed of
being on television.

10:26.393 --> 10:30.731
No, I said "I had a dream
in which I was a television."

10:30.798 --> 10:32.666
If you're gonna
throw my dreams
in my face,

10:32.733 --> 10:34.601
I'll find someone else
to share them with.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.939
My mistake.
I'm very sorry.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.273
Yeah,
I keep his dream journal.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.309
He was not a television.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.613
(APPLAUSE)

10:46.680 --> 10:48.115
Okay, you guys, get ready

10:48.181 --> 10:50.283
because Sugar, the wonder dog
is gonna tell us

10:50.350 --> 10:52.352
which one of these people
has diabetes.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.825
(BARKS)
Do you have diabetes?

10:59.827 --> 11:01.995
Unbelievable!

11:02.062 --> 11:04.932
Okay, who's ready for
an audience dance off?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.299
What-what?

11:06.366 --> 11:08.468
(UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS)

11:09.937 --> 11:11.772
A diabetes-sniffing dog?

11:11.839 --> 11:13.373
Are you kidding me?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.408
I know. Incredible.

11:15.475 --> 11:18.178
Yeah, incredibly stupid.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.780
If you're worried about
having diabetes,

11:19.847 --> 11:21.248
you shouldn't be
consulting a dog.

11:21.314 --> 11:24.284
You need insulin,
not rin-tin-tinsulin.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.686
Fresh.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.722
A lot of people
are pretty into her show.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.390
That's because
they haven't seen
the show I saw

11:30.457 --> 11:31.691
in that airstream trailer.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.393
It was called
"I Will Not Shower,"

11:33.460 --> 11:34.795
and it ran
for way too long.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.432
Dad, you are, like,
the hero of all my friends.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.468
Oh, thank you.
Do you have it?

11:41.534 --> 11:43.303
Have what?
The backpack.

11:44.337 --> 11:47.507
Molly,
sweet, sweet Molly,

11:47.574 --> 11:50.543
that was never
gonna happen.

11:50.610 --> 11:54.782
It was just something said
in the middle of a pissing
contest between siblings.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.250
So, you just lied to me?

11:57.317 --> 11:58.852
Great parenting, Dad.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.455
You heard her.
Great parenting.

12:02.522 --> 12:05.558
Take away the tone.
That's a compliment.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.595
I don't think Wendi
was involved in that
pissing contest.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.998
Yeah, she was.
She was big-timing me.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.565
Just like today
when she came to my office

12:12.632 --> 12:14.067
and asked me
to be on her show.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.169
How exactly
is that big-timing you?

12:16.236 --> 12:17.337
You just don't get it,
do you?

12:17.404 --> 12:20.007
I really don't.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.476
This is her chance
in front of mom, dad,
and the entire world

12:23.543 --> 12:26.646
to finally show up
her high achieving,
handsome, athletic,

12:26.713 --> 12:29.482
if he had been encouraged,
brother.

12:29.549 --> 12:32.019
Ken, admit it.
You're jealous of Wendi.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.553
(CHUCKLING) Jealous?

12:33.620 --> 12:35.422
Wow. (LAUGHS)

12:35.488 --> 12:39.226
Who gave this lady
her therapy license,
am I right?

12:39.292 --> 12:41.328
Okay, fine, if you're
gonna make jokes to
the lamp about me,

12:41.394 --> 12:43.130
don't do Wendi's show.
No, no, whoa, whoa.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.465
I'm gonna do it,
but as a real doctor.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.034
I'm not gonna
condescend to people.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.870
You know,
talk down to them.

12:49.937 --> 12:53.540
Look, maybe I'm
just a therapist
who's super smart,

12:53.606 --> 12:56.910
but you obviously have
issues with your sister,
and at some point,

12:56.977 --> 12:58.511
you're gonna have to talk
to her about them.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.613
Okay, whatever.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.216
Piece of advice for you,
don't marry a therapist.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.118
(CHUCKLES)

13:05.185 --> 13:06.954
I'm gonna
leave you two alone.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.293
This is like
the second part of my dream

13:13.360 --> 13:14.828
where Dr. Wendi
is my doctor

13:14.895 --> 13:16.930
and she takes me
into the exam room,

13:16.997 --> 13:19.867
but the exam room
is this green room.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.802
Come on, guys,
act like you've been here.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.137
Sorry. You're right.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.505
I... Shrimp.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.040
Aw, hell, no.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.879
Dr. Park, you're on in 10.
You ready?

13:31.945 --> 13:33.780
I was born ready.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.149
Okay, I'm just gonna
tell them that you're ready.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.986
All right, now remember,
the topic is heatstroke,

13:39.052 --> 13:41.088
and if there's a dance break,
we prefer that you dance.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.390
Yeah, I'm not gonna dance.
It's okay.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.492
Even if you're not good...
Yeah, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.761
I've got moves for days.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.532
But today, I come to you
as a doctor, not a dancer.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.801
It's been great
meeting you.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.571
Ken? Oh, Ken.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.640
What are you doing here?
Well,
I came to remind you

14:00.707 --> 14:02.309
that you promised
to plug the clinic on air.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.743
Just say something like,

14:03.810 --> 14:06.113
"Welltopia,
where well meets topia

14:06.179 --> 14:07.948
"in the San Fernando Valley."

14:08.015 --> 14:09.382
"Topia's" not a word.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.685
Neither is shrimpgasm,
but that is what
is happening right now.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.656
AUDIENCE: (CHANTING) Chug.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.593
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

14:22.095 --> 14:23.463
20 ounces down.

14:23.530 --> 14:27.300
44 more to go
for ideal hydration!

14:27.367 --> 14:31.571
And now, as a special treat
for heatstroke week,

14:31.638 --> 14:35.575
I want to introduce you
to a super awesome doctor
and my big bro.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.810
Please welcome
Dr. Ken Park!

14:37.877 --> 14:40.447
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Yes! Yes!

14:41.481 --> 14:42.515
Whoo!

14:42.582 --> 14:43.783
Hi!

14:44.617 --> 14:46.053
Hi.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.387
(LAUGHS)

14:48.421 --> 14:49.789
Shout-out to mom and dad!

14:53.293 --> 14:54.861
So, avoiding heatstroke,

14:54.928 --> 14:56.997
to wear a hat
or not to wear a hat.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.398
That is the question.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.934
Well, I think we have to
back it up a little bit.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.702
Heatstroke is a result
of the body

15:02.769 --> 15:04.938
trying to regulate...
So, hats good or bad?

15:05.738 --> 15:07.640
Well, um, good,

15:07.707 --> 15:10.210
but it's important to look
at all the factors involved

15:10.277 --> 15:13.981
in temperature regulation...
Okay, so a hat it is!

15:14.047 --> 15:16.249
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. Ken Park!

15:16.316 --> 15:18.518
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Ken Park!

15:18.585 --> 15:20.720
Coming up next,
we solve the mystery...

15:20.787 --> 15:23.623
What that tricky SPF number
actually means?

15:24.291 --> 15:25.858
(AUDIENCE WHOOPING)

15:25.925 --> 15:27.060
You can go now.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.062
I'm not done.
You're not?

15:29.129 --> 15:31.564
Uh, in order to
prevent heatstroke,

15:31.631 --> 15:33.733
one must identify
the three main...

15:33.800 --> 15:36.269
Okay, hats off to you,
big bro.

15:36.336 --> 15:40.173
And now I have hats
for everyone in the audience!

15:40.240 --> 15:42.042
What?

15:42.109 --> 15:43.310
Look under your seat.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.711
You get a hat!
Oh, my God!

15:44.777 --> 15:46.479
You get a hat!
You get a hat!

15:46.546 --> 15:48.548
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

15:48.615 --> 15:50.783
Okay, you can't solve
everything with a hat,
Wendi.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.685
Well, you can solve
heatstroke.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.787
Anyway...
Not if you're young,
elderly,

15:54.854 --> 15:57.157
or have a compromised
immune system. Boom!

15:57.224 --> 15:59.192
Whoo! Yes!

15:59.259 --> 16:02.062
That's true, but we like
to keep things light
on the show.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.064
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

16:04.131 --> 16:06.499
Uh, real medicine
isn't light.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.401
People die on my watch
every day.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.802
Yes, they do!

16:09.869 --> 16:12.239
Many people die!
Whoo!

16:15.242 --> 16:16.809
Hey, I do a lot of good
on this show,

16:16.876 --> 16:18.445
and people take it
really seriously.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.714
FYI, if someone
can do this on a show,

16:21.781 --> 16:24.317
then it's not serious.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.952
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
You know, no, I am...

16:28.921 --> 16:31.158
You just don't get it
because you're small
and jealous.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.559
I'm not jealous
of a doctor

16:32.625 --> 16:34.394
who went to med school
in the Caribbean.

16:34.461 --> 16:35.762
(AUDIENCE MURMURS)

16:35.828 --> 16:36.929
I mean, her diploma says...

16:36.996 --> 16:38.998
(JAMAICAN ACCENT)
"Good job, mon."

16:39.066 --> 16:42.035
You know what, he's right.
I did go to med school
in the Caribbean.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.304
A fully accredited
medical school,

16:44.371 --> 16:46.906
and I went there because
I took a different Path.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.808
I wanted to have some fun
along the way.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.544
(CHUCKLING)
Yeah, you had a lot of fun.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.813
At least I wasn't a virgin
at 30.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.882
(ALL GASP)

16:55.948 --> 16:58.251
Sorry I respected my body!

17:03.490 --> 17:05.125
(SIGHS)

17:05.192 --> 17:08.928
Welltopia,
where well meets topia
in the San Fernando Valley.

17:21.908 --> 17:23.876
I invite you here,
and you do that?

17:23.943 --> 17:26.113
You just asked me here
to big-time me.

17:26.179 --> 17:30.150
I asked you here
because you're my brother
and a doctor.

17:30.217 --> 17:33.486
You know what I think?
You wish I was still
a lost little 20-something

17:33.553 --> 17:35.855
living in a trailer
in Santa Cruz, don't you?

17:35.922 --> 17:37.890
Of course not.
You had lice.

17:37.957 --> 17:41.161
Then my Camry had lice
for the next six months.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.895
You've always been
the perfect one

17:42.962 --> 17:44.264
that mom and dad
worshipped,

17:44.331 --> 17:45.498
and I've always
been the one

17:45.565 --> 17:48.000
that did things
with an asterisk next to them.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.303
Got a bachelor degree,
in six years.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.572
Went to medical school,
on a boat.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.907
Finally,
I have some success,

17:54.974 --> 17:57.444
and I wanted
to show it off to you

17:57.510 --> 17:59.279
not because I think
I'm better than you,

17:59.346 --> 18:01.348
but because I thought
I owed it to you.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.550
You bailed me out
so many times.

18:03.616 --> 18:07.420
I couldn't do any of this
without my big brother.

18:07.487 --> 18:08.788
I didn't know
you felt that way
about me.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.056
Of course I do.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.624
I always have.

18:13.193 --> 18:16.563
So, everything you have
is because of me?

18:18.198 --> 18:19.566
Not everything.

18:19.632 --> 18:24.036
Wow, everything you have
is because of me.

18:25.838 --> 18:29.576
Okay, now I know
what Allison is always
complaining about.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.743
Look, I'm sorry.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.880
I am small,
and I did get jealous,

18:33.946 --> 18:35.548
but I'm also
really impressed.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.717
I mean,
your show is legit.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.620
Well, we could probably
dig a little deeper
on some issues.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.356
Either way,
you're helping people,

18:43.423 --> 18:45.192
and I am
so proud of you.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.194
Aww.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.129
You know, I'm gonna be in LA
a lot now,

18:50.197 --> 18:51.398
and I really want
to see you guys more.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.466
I think
we'd all like that.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.202
You know,
you're not the first Park

18:55.268 --> 18:59.138
to dip his toe
into the world of
medical infotainment.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.674
Remember my show
on the campus TV station
back in med school?

19:01.741 --> 19:04.211
That's right.
Yo! K-MD Raps!

19:04.277 --> 19:06.446
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS) Good times.

19:08.114 --> 19:13.119
We are very disappointed
in you two.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.422
You have brought shame...
Oh, shrimp.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.391
Come on.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.697
So, when's the show
gonna be on?

19:24.764 --> 19:27.334
Oh, it's never gonna air.
I wrecked it
by fighting with her.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.136
Apparently I cost the studio
over a million dollars.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.806
Ah! It's like
I kept telling you,

19:33.873 --> 19:37.310
all I needed to do
was talk to Wendi
about my feelings.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.711
She just doesn't listen.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.348
Wives, right?

19:41.414 --> 19:44.083
Look, I know you've
always been the star
of your family,

19:44.150 --> 19:45.752
and it's not easy
to share the spotlight.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.420
So, you're saying
I'm a star?

19:47.487 --> 19:49.722
No. I'm saying...

19:49.789 --> 19:51.291
You know what?
Yes, Ken, you're a star.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.162
Oh, oh,
you can ignore me,

19:56.229 --> 19:59.532
but you can't ignore this.

made that night.

20:11.378 --> 20:14.947
I remember.
Here's your very own
crumb sweeper.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.049

what you described's
appendicitis
