I learned your comrade
not only attacked the Okaaran Warlords...

18:36.700 --> 18:38.535

...he callously destroyed
every living being on those ships.

18:43.082 --> 18:47.544
After which, he created
a puppet government, loyal only to him...

...on the very world
he was sworn to protect.

18:51.048 --> 18:56.929
