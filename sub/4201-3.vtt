WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:02.569
April:
PREVIOUSLY,
ON  CHASING LIFE...

00:02.603 --> 00:04.572
THIS IS A RING.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.674
WE'RE ENGAGED.

00:06.706 --> 00:08.342
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:08.375 --> 00:10.343
Natalie:
I THINK YOU'RE STILL
IN LOVE WITH APRIL.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.112
-IT'S COMPLICATED.
-NOT FOR ME.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.013
I LIED TO MY SON.
AND THAT'S A THING

00:14.048 --> 00:15.682
THAT HE HASN'T
FORGIVEN ME FOR.

00:15.715 --> 00:17.751
BUT ALL YOU CAN DO
IS KEEP SHOWING UP

00:17.785 --> 00:19.754
AND HOPE THAT ONE DAY,
HE'LL BE READY TO.

00:19.786 --> 00:22.655
-WELL, AS THE TOKEN
STRAIGHT GIRL--
-OH, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE--

00:22.690 --> 00:25.192
YEAH, THEY--
THEY DON'T MAKE US WEAR SIGNS.

00:25.225 --> 00:27.193
YOU SHOULD TOTALLY
HIT THAT.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.696
-THE BOOK
IS REALLY DISTURBING.
-IF ANYTHING,

00:28.728 --> 00:30.564
IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE
YOUR DAD WASN'T THAT CREATIVE.

00:30.597 --> 00:32.566
BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE,
IT'S EVEN CREEPIER.

00:32.600 --> 00:36.237
HE TALKS ABOUT
HOW HE'S PLANNED
HIS OWN DEATH FOR YEARS.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.539
APRIL'S MEDICAL EXPENSES
ARE HIGH.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.240
AND PRIVATE SCHOOL
IS A LOT TOO.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.109
YOU'RE MAKING ME
LEAVE CHARTON?

00:42.143 --> 00:45.612
-THIS IS THE LAST THING--
-IT'S NOT FAIR.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.682
(phone beeping)

01:02.396 --> 01:05.698
Brenna:
HEY, GREER.
I MISS YOU TOO.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.635
(soft music playing)

01:07.668 --> 01:09.736
REMEMBER WHEN WE
ALMOST GOT KICKED OUT
OF PRIVATE SCHOOL?

01:09.769 --> 01:12.105
WELL,
NOW I ACTUALLY DID...

01:12.138 --> 01:13.674
BY MY MOM.

01:13.706 --> 01:16.109
IT WAS REALLY AWESOME
OF HER TO FORCE ME

01:16.143 --> 01:18.412
TO GO TO CHARTON
AGAINST MY WILL,

01:18.445 --> 01:21.581
WAIT UNTIL I WAS HAPPY THERE
AND THEN FORCE ME TO LEAVE.

01:21.614 --> 01:23.384
I HAD TO QUIT MY JOB
AT ALCHEMY

01:23.417 --> 01:25.486
'CAUSE IT'S TOO FAR
FROM MY NEW SCHOOL.

01:25.519 --> 01:29.256
BUT SINCE APRIL GOT SICK,
SHE ALWAYS COMES FIRST,

01:29.289 --> 01:31.625
ESPECIALLY NOW
THAT SHE'S GETTING MARRIED.

01:31.658 --> 01:34.762
THERE'S, LIKE,
NO WAY TO COMPETE
WITH THE CANCER BRIDE.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.831
SO I DON'T.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.400
I JUST KEEP
MY DUMB PROBLEMS TO MYSELF

01:39.432 --> 01:42.469
AND WAIT
FOR GRADUATION.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.240
I KNOW I SOUND
REALLY BITTER,

01:46.272 --> 01:49.242
BUT IT'S BECAUSE
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS WAY.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.311
EVER SINCE I WAS BORN,

01:51.344 --> 01:53.480
I'VE BEEN LIVING
IN APRIL'S SHADOW.

01:53.514 --> 01:56.182
AND NOW THAT SHE'S SICK,
I'M NOT EVEN ALLOWED
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT,

01:56.216 --> 01:57.685
'CAUSE THAT
WOULD MAKE ME THE BITCH.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.652
'MORNING, GIRLS.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.254
'MORNING.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.790
HEY, BREN,
BET YOU'RE HAPPY

02:03.823 --> 02:06.727
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEAR
THAT UNIFORM ANYMORE, HUH?

02:06.760 --> 02:09.597
WHAT?
YOU ALWAYS HATED IT.

02:09.629 --> 02:12.165
AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THAT IN PUBLIC SCHOOL.

02:13.766 --> 02:15.802
HEY, LISTEN, YOU WANT
TO GO SHOPPING THIS WEEKEND?

02:15.836 --> 02:17.371
CAN WE AFFORD THAT?

02:17.403 --> 02:19.639
OKAY, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,
BUT TRUST ME WHEN I TELL YOU

02:19.673 --> 02:21.509
SOME OF THE BEST THINGS
IN LIFE

02:21.542 --> 02:23.343
DON'T SEEM
THAT APPEALING AT FIRST.

02:23.377 --> 02:26.280
-AND THEN--
-THIS IS GOING VERY WELL,
SARA.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.515
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY
KEEP TALKING.

02:28.549 --> 02:31.217
I'M TRYING
TO POINT OUT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

02:31.252 --> 02:34.521
BUT... I'LL JUST--
I'LL BE QUIET.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.757
Emma:
IT HASN'T HAPPENED
IN YOUR LIFETIME,

02:36.789 --> 02:38.792
BUT I'M STILL
HOLDING OUT HOPE.

02:38.825 --> 02:42.562
HEY. I'M SORRY
YOU'RE HAVING A BAD WEEK.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.764
AND I HATE
THAT I HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH IT.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.334
-IT'S OKAY.
-WELL, I WANT TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING

02:47.367 --> 02:51.472
THAT I HOPE
MIGHT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.707
SO YOU KNOW,
I'VE HAD ALL OF THESE
BIG DECISIONS

02:54.741 --> 02:56.644
TO MAKE LATELY.

02:56.676 --> 02:59.646
SO IT WAS A HUGE RELIEF
THAT THE DECISION

02:59.680 --> 03:02.616
ABOUT WHO TO PICK
FOR MY MAID OF HONOR
WAS A NO-BRAINER.

03:02.650 --> 03:07.354
BRENNA,
I WOULD BE HONORED FOR YOU
TO BE MY MAID OF HONOR.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.289
WILL YOU?

03:10.957 --> 03:13.727
YEAH.
OF COURSE.

03:16.896 --> 03:20.300
♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL, HONEY ♪

03:20.334 --> 03:23.437
♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL ♪

03:23.469 --> 03:27.875

03:27.908 --> 03:29.842

03:35.515 --> 03:36.884
♪ WON'T STOP. ♪

03:36.917 --> 03:39.620
OKAY, BREN, I
HAVE ALL MY WEDDING
SPREADSHEETS ONLINE,

03:39.652 --> 03:40.888
SO I'M GOING
TO SHARE THOSE WITH YOU NOW.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.855
(yawning)
GREAT.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.558
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE
BEING A MAID OF HONOR.
I DID IT THREE TIMES.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.926
EACH TIME, I DID
A DIFFERENT READING

03:46.961 --> 03:48.728
BY MY FAVORITE POET,
e.e. cummings.

03:48.762 --> 03:52.498
UH, APRIL, WOULD YOU
BE INTERESTED IN A READING
BY MY FAVORITE POET,

03:52.533 --> 03:53.766
NICKI MINAJ?

03:53.800 --> 03:55.902
-(all chuckle)
-UH, SURE, GRANDMA.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.871
ALL RIGHT, FIRST UP
ARE INVITATIONS.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.772
WOULD YOU MIND
PICKING THOSE UP
FROM THE PRINTING STORE?

03:59.807 --> 04:01.808
AND THEN I CAN HELP YOU
STUFF AND STAMP ENVELOPES?

04:01.842 --> 04:03.310
YEAH, SURE.

04:03.343 --> 04:06.280
UM, I JUST--
I HAVE FILM CLUB
AFTER SCHOOL.

04:06.312 --> 04:08.014
BUT I CAN RUN
TO THE STORE FIRST.

04:08.247 --> 04:09.917
THOSE NEED
TO GO OUT TODAY?

04:09.949 --> 04:11.384
-YES.
-IF YOU CAN.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.753
WELL, SORRY, BUT THE WEDDING
IS IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.889
THIS IS ALREADY
A LAST-MINUTE NOTICE
FOR YOUR GUESTS.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.891
-SO...
-Brenna: OKAY.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.593
OKAY.
TODAY IT IS.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.694
OH, AND TOMORROW
AT THE BRIDAL SHOP,

04:21.728 --> 04:24.865
WILL YOU HELP ME
PICK OUT BRIDESMAID DRESSES
FOR YOU, BETH AND NATALIE?

04:24.898 --> 04:26.500
TOTALLY, YEAH.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.302
Sara:
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DON'T
ALREADY HAVE A DRESS.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.269
-Leo: KNOCK KNOCK!
-WE'RE GOING TO NEED
TO FIND SOMETHING

04:30.303 --> 04:31.939
-THAT FITS LIKE A GLOVE.
-YOU GUYS HOME?

04:31.971 --> 04:33.941
-THERE'S GOING TO BE
NO TIME FOR ALTERATIONS.
-IT'LL WORK OUT, MOM.

04:33.973 --> 04:36.709
-DON'T WORRY.
-YOU KNOW WHAT, SARA?
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.846
AND I GUESS MAYBE
APRIL AND I DON'T BOTH NEED

04:38.879 --> 04:42.850
TO BE WEARING GOWNS AFTER ALL.
MIGHT SAVE US SOME TIME.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.353
AHEM.

04:47.387 --> 04:50.524
GOOD MORNING, ESTROGEN HOUSE.
AND HOW ARE WE DOING TODAY?

04:50.557 --> 04:52.893
-FINE.
-OUTWARDLY PLEASANT,

04:52.925 --> 04:55.896
WITH TENSIONS BOILING
JUST UNDER THE SURFACE.

04:55.928 --> 04:57.798
-AH.
-BRENNA IS GOING
TO BE MY MAID OF HONOR.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.401
OOH.
SO SORRY.

05:00.434 --> 05:03.370
OW. MY TUMOR.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.507
Nicholas:
YOU'RE NOT ENTERING
THE FILM FESTIVAL?

05:07.540 --> 05:09.509
BUT I WAS GOING TO BE
THE NEXT HEATH LEDGER.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.778
DUDE, I WAS HEATH.
YOU WERE JAKE.

05:11.812 --> 05:15.615
I WANT TO,
BUT I CAN'T UNLESS
I'M AN ACTIVE STUDENT HERE.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.451
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE GOING TO PUBLIC SCHOOL.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.454
YEAH, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
START CARRYING A KNIFE.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.088
HEY, IF YOU GET ALL Cs,
YOU MIGHT BE VALEDICTORIAN.

05:22.322 --> 05:26.060
GUYS, THIS ISN'T HELPING.
PUBLIC SCHOOL ISN'T THAT BAD.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.696
FORD, YOU TAUGHT THOSE KIDS
HOW TO KNIT AT ROXBURY.

05:28.728 --> 05:30.930
THAT WAS PUBLIC SCHOOL,
RIGHT?

05:30.963 --> 05:33.867
MM-HMM.
IT WAS REALLY SCARY.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.702
I'M SO DEPRESSED
YOU'RE LEAVING.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.738
ALISON DALY'S SKIRT
IS STUCK IN HER SPANX

05:38.771 --> 05:40.740
AND IT'S BRINGING ME
NO JOY.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.742
HUNTER, MAKE ME LAUGH.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.812
YOU HAVEN'T MADE
ANY SEXUAL JOKES
ABOUT YOUR FOOD,

05:44.845 --> 05:46.680
AND IT'S
PIGS-IN-A-BLANKET DAY.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.981
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT, LIKE, TOO OBVIOUS
OR SOMETHING.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.918
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING
THEY WOULD JOKE ABOUT
IN PUBLIC SCHOOL.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.687
OH, HUNTER.
PIGS IN A BLANKET.

05:54.721 --> 05:55.988
ANYTHING TO SAY
ABOUT THAT?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.091
HE CAN'T EVEN.
IT'S BRENNA'S LAST DAY
HERE TOMORROW

05:58.125 --> 05:59.393
AND WE'RE ALL IN MOURNING.

05:59.425 --> 06:00.694
YOU'RE LEAVING CHARTON?

06:00.728 --> 06:02.362
YEAH, MY MOM
IS PULLING ME OUT.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.531
WE HAVE TOO MANY EXPENSES

06:04.564 --> 06:06.567
AND, OF COURSE,
MINE WAS CUT FIRST.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.435
SO I CAN'T ENTER
THE FILM FESTIVAL.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.137
WHY NOT?
WE HAVE A COUPLE MORE DAYS.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.673
LET'S JUST GET BACK
INTO EDITING AS SOON
AS YOU'RE OUT OF CLASS.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.908
WELL, I HAVE TO RUN AN ERRAND
FOR MY SISTER FIRST.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.478
SHE PICKED ME TO BE
MAID OF HONOR.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.646
I'M STARTING TO UNDERSTAND
WHY THEY CALL IT A "MAID."

06:20.680 --> 06:22.815
OKAY.
WELL, WE HAVE TOMORROW TOO.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.819
TOMORROW WE'RE DRESS SHOPPING,
AND THAT'S MY LAST DAY HERE.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.954
SO I ONLY HAVE TODAY.

06:27.987 --> 06:31.057
(sighs)
OH, I CAN'T DO THIS.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.994
WELL, THE HOPELESSNESS
AND SELF-DOUBT IN YOUR VOICE
TELLS ME ONE THING.

06:34.026 --> 06:35.795
YOU'RE DEFINITELY A FILMMAKER.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.531
DON'T FREAK OUT.
I'VE GOT YOU.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.867
WE'LL GET IT DONE.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.101
OKAY.

06:42.136 --> 06:44.036
OKAY.

06:46.038 --> 06:48.542
"I'VE GOT YOU."
(gasps)

06:48.574 --> 06:51.911
(laughing)

06:51.944 --> 06:55.048
THEY WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE READY YESTERDAY.

06:55.081 --> 06:59.019
SORRY, THIS IS MY MOM'S STORE.
SHE ALWAYS TAKES LONGER
THAN SHE SAYS.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.088
-MOM!
-HEY, IT'S JUST--

07:01.120 --> 07:04.891
-I HAVE TO LEAVE,
LIKE, FIVE MINUTES AGO.
-MOM, ARE THEY DONE?

07:04.925 --> 07:07.461
WE'RE GOING TO MISS
ALL OF FILM CLUB.

07:07.494 --> 07:08.829
YOU ARE SERIOUSLY ANGSTING.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.531
ARE YOU REALLY
THIS INTO FILMMAKING,

07:10.564 --> 07:11.999
OR IS IT ABOUT
YOUR CRUSH ON THE TEACHER?

07:12.031 --> 07:13.500
SHE'S NOT A TEACHER.

07:13.533 --> 07:16.103
AH, HERE THEY ARE.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.939
"APRIL CRAVER."

07:18.971 --> 07:21.641
MY SISTER'S NAME
IS SPELLED WRONG.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.810
-THESE HAVE TO BE REDONE.
-AH, HANG ON.

07:23.843 --> 07:26.112
LET ME GET MY MOM.
MOM!

07:26.146 --> 07:28.981
YOU KNOW, I GOTTA GO.
I'LL JUST-- I'LL COME BACK.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.485
OKAY, BUT SHE CAN BE
KIND OF SHADY ABOUT
DOING REPRINTS,

07:31.518 --> 07:33.086
SO I'D TALK TO HER
IF I WERE YOU.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.721
DOES YOUR MOM
EVEN EXIST?

07:34.754 --> 07:36.055
UNFORTUNATELY.

07:36.088 --> 07:38.826
HANG ON A SEC.
MOM!

07:47.233 --> 07:50.103
IF THOSE NEW
CLINICAL-TRIAL DRUGS ARE FUN,

07:50.137 --> 07:52.105
-CAN I TRY SOME?
-MMM.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.641
SURE, IF YOU WANT TO BE
A HUMAN GUINEA PIG.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.976
YOU KNOW,
I KNOW I PICKED THIS TRIAL,

07:57.009 --> 08:00.112
BUT IT'S SO SCARY
BEING A TEST SUBJECT.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.182
THESE DRUGS ARE SO NEW,
THE LAST PHASE

08:02.216 --> 08:04.550
WAS TO MAKE SURE
THEY DIDN'T KILL PEOPLE.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.653
OKAY.
MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO TRY 'EM.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.021
EXACTLY.
AT LEAST THIS PHASE

08:09.055 --> 08:10.858
IS TO SEE
IF THEY CAN HEAL PEOPLE.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.192
LET'S HOPE.
I THINK IT'S GREAT

08:13.226 --> 08:15.995
YOU'RE TAKING CHARGE
OF YOUR HEALTH LIKE THIS.

08:16.028 --> 08:19.499
MY HEALTH, MAYBE.
MY CAREER? NOT SO MUCH.

08:19.533 --> 08:22.168
BUT YOU?
YOURS IS INSANE.

08:22.201 --> 08:24.170
YOU'RE GETTING
PUBLISHED AGAIN.

08:24.204 --> 08:27.007
YEAH, I KNOW.
I FEEL PRETTY LUCKY.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.908
I'M SURE IT WAS NICE
TO GET SOME GOOD NEWS

08:28.942 --> 08:30.644
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
WITH NATALIE.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.211
I HEARD.
I'M SORRY.

08:32.245 --> 08:35.182
I GUESS IT JUST
WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.584
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO ANSWER THIS
IF IT'S WEIRD,

08:37.618 --> 08:40.721
BUT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOU TWO?

08:40.754 --> 08:42.788
AND IT'S WEIRD.
OKAY.

08:42.822 --> 08:45.158
HEY, YOU KNOW
WHO I HEARD FROM RECENTLY?

08:45.192 --> 08:47.027
-MY MOM.
-REALLY?

08:47.059 --> 08:49.196
SHE JUST GOT
HER REAL-ESTATE LICENSE.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.663
OH! GO, MARIANN.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.298
YOU GUYS ARE IN TOUCH.
THAT'S AWESOME.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.168
A LITTLE.
SHE'S BEEN TRYING
TO GET TOGETHER,

08:55.201 --> 08:57.303
BUT, I DON'T KNOW.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.573
YOU SHOULD.
SHE'S A GOOD PERSON.

09:00.606 --> 09:04.311
SHE JUST GOT
INTO A BAD SITUATION.

09:04.543 --> 09:06.312
IT WASN'T EVEN ABOUT
WHAT SHE DID.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.115
I JUST CAN'T STAND
BEING LIED TO.

09:08.148 --> 09:12.052
I'M SORRY.
I WAS PRETTY HARSH
ABOUT THAT WITH YOU.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.653
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY THAT,

09:13.687 --> 09:15.855
BUT IT STILL
FEELS GOOD TO HEAR.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.857
I'M SURE YOUR MOM
WOULD AGREE.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.091
I KNOW.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.727
IT'S JUST SO AWKWARD
BETWEEN US NOW.

09:21.761 --> 09:24.230
MAYBE YOU'RE JUST NOT READY
FOR ALONE TIME YET.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.232
WHY DON'T WE
ALL GO TO LUNCH TOGETHER?

09:26.265 --> 09:28.067
I'D LOVE TO SEE HER AGAIN.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.803
WHILE NOT HIGH
ON A POT COOKIE.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.142
(both panting)

09:35.174 --> 09:38.278
GOD!
IS THIS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO EXERCISE?

09:54.126 --> 09:56.229
I'M SORRY I JUST STOPPED BY.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.899
I NEEDED TO TALK,
AND I KNEW NO ONE AT HOME
WOULD CARE.

09:59.932 --> 10:03.636
I PROMISE I CARE.
I JUST ALSO CARE
ABOUT MY ABS.

10:03.669 --> 10:06.038
CAN'T YOU JUST SKIP
DRESS SHOPPING TOMORROW?

10:06.072 --> 10:09.142
BRIDESMAID DRESSES
WILL BE DISGUSTING WHETHER
YOU'RE THERE OR NOT.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.344
I DOUBT IT.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.111
NOW THAT APRIL'S CANCER
IS BACK,

10:12.144 --> 10:14.114
I'D BE A JERK
FOR EVEN ASKING.

10:14.147 --> 10:17.250
OH, YEAH,
THE CANCER FACTOR.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.351
RIGHT?

10:18.384 --> 10:21.822
IT'S ALWAYS TERRIBLE TIMING.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.024
APRIL'S STARTING
THIS CLINICAL TRIAL

10:24.057 --> 10:25.859
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT
SAVE HER LIFE.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.195
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT MY LITTLE MOVIE
IS GOING TO MATTER

10:28.227 --> 10:30.230
-NEXT TO HER WEDDING.
-MMM.

10:30.263 --> 10:33.100
IT'S NOT EASY
BEING APRIL CARVER'S SISTER.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.369
-KEEP TALKING.
-LET'S JUST SAY,

10:35.402 --> 10:37.903
FEEL LUCKY YOU DIDN'T
SHARE A BOYFRIEND WITH HER.

10:37.937 --> 10:39.105
EW.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.942
WHATEVER HAPPENED
WITH YOU AND DOMINIC ANYWAY?

10:41.975 --> 10:44.177
IT ENDED SO QUICKLY.

10:44.211 --> 10:48.414
UM, WELL,
LONG STORY SHORT,

10:48.648 --> 10:52.385
HE DIDN'T WANT ME
AS MUCH AS I WANTED HIM,
SO I HAD TO GET OUT.

10:52.418 --> 10:55.254
I'M OVER FEELING UNWANTED.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.957
THANKS, DADDY ISSUES.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.293
SORRY. I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID THAT TO YOU.

11:00.326 --> 11:04.798
NO, IT'S OKAY.
I'M GLAD THAT
YOU TELL ME THESE THINGS.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.369
(sighs)

11:13.340 --> 11:15.207
Sara:
OH.

11:15.241 --> 11:18.745
UM, I ASSUMED THAT YOU
WERE STAYING HERE TONIGHT

11:18.778 --> 11:20.746
SINCE WE ARE DRESS SHOPPING
TOMORROW, RIGHT?

11:20.780 --> 11:22.182
OH.
I'LL JUST MEET YOU ALL THERE.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.184
OKAY.
WELL, YOU KNOW,

11:25.217 --> 11:27.421
NOT TO BUTT IN OR ANYTHING,

11:27.453 --> 11:30.890
BUT I DON'T LOVE
THE THOUGHT OF YOU BEING
OUT IN PUBLIC BY YOURSELF

11:30.923 --> 11:33.059
-WHILE YOU'RE ADJUSTING
TO YOUR NEW MEDS.
-(door opens)

11:33.092 --> 11:35.428
APRIL, WE JUST DON'T KNOW IF--
HA! HI, LEO.

11:35.461 --> 11:37.364
-I SAID THE SAME THING.
-YEAH.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.900
HE IS EVEN MORE PARANOID
ABOUT MY HEALTH THAN YOU ARE.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.102
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.
I'LL BE IN GOOD HANDS

11:43.135 --> 11:45.971
-WHEN WE LIVE TOGETHER.
-AND WHEN WILL THAT BE?

11:46.005 --> 11:49.209
IDEALLY, BEFORE THE WEDDING,
BUT WE'RE NOT IN A HUGE RUSH.

11:49.241 --> 11:51.244
I MEAN, THIS ALL HAPPENED
SO QUICKLY ANYWAY.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.712
YEAH, IT DID.

11:53.746 --> 11:56.716
OH, UH, SARA,
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK

11:56.750 --> 11:59.385
IF YOU'D DO ME A FAVOR--
WELL, US A FAVOR.

11:59.418 --> 12:02.355
I KNOW APRIL WOULD LIKE
TO AVOID PUBLIC HUMILIATION.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.890
UM, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DANCE.

12:04.924 --> 12:05.991
LIKE, AT ALL.

12:06.025 --> 12:07.827
I WAS HOPING TO LEARN
SOMETHING SIMPLE

12:07.860 --> 12:10.363
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE
THE WHOLE FIRST DANCE
AT THE WEDDING.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.231
WELL, I'M AFRAID
I DON'T KNOW

12:12.264 --> 12:14.333
OF ANY DANCE TEACHERS
OFF-HAND, BUT--

12:14.366 --> 12:17.136
WELL, NO, I WAS ACTUALLY
THINKING YOU MIGHT TEACH ME.

12:17.169 --> 12:18.304
I HEARD YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD.

12:18.337 --> 12:21.006
(laughs)
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

12:21.041 --> 12:24.311
-I'M CERTAINLY NOT A TEACHER.
-WELL, I SAW YOU AT
THAT TANGO CLASS.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.246
MAYBE YOU COULD
JUST TEACH HIM, LIKE,

12:27.279 --> 12:29.448
A LITTLE BOX STEP
OR SOMETHING?

12:29.482 --> 12:31.384
PLEASE?

12:31.418 --> 12:33.385
OKAY.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.020
CAN YOU COME BY
TOMORROW NIGHT?

12:35.054 --> 12:37.423
DONE, THANK YOU.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.259
NOT AS MUCH AS I DO.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.027
OKAY.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.934
ANYWAY, IT FEELS SO GREAT
TO JUST--

12:48.969 --> 12:51.104
TO BE BACK
IN THE WORKFORCE.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.806
YOU KNOW?
I GOT BUSINESS CARDS

12:52.838 --> 12:54.407
AND I GOT MY FACE
ON A FREAKIN' BENCH.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.842
-I MEAN, I'VE ARRIVED.
-YEAH, YOU HAVE.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.544
YEAH, MOM.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.548
AH WELL, THANKS, GUYS.
THAT MEANS A LOT.

13:01.780 --> 13:04.518
ANYWAY, I'M A LITTLE BIT
INSECURE TODAY

13:04.551 --> 13:07.019
BECAUSE I'M JUST ABOUT
TO SHOW MY FIRST HOUSE.

13:07.052 --> 13:09.221
SO I HOPE
I DON'T SCREW IT UP.

13:09.255 --> 13:11.091
YOU WON'T.
JUST DON'T GET IN YOUR HEAD.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.559
(laughs)
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD
THAT ADVICE.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.928
I MEAN, HOW COULD I
NOT BE IN MY HEAD?

13:15.961 --> 13:19.032
THAT'S WHERE I LIVE.
IT FEELS SO GREAT

13:19.065 --> 13:22.802
JUST TO FINALLY
HAVE SOME DIRECTION
WITH MY LIFE AGAIN.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.837
AH, I MISS THAT.

13:24.870 --> 13:27.206
I'VE BEEN FEELING
SO AIMLESS

13:27.240 --> 13:29.241
SINCE BEING UNEMPLOYED.

13:29.275 --> 13:31.577
OH, YOU'RE NOT WORKING
AT  THE POST  ANYMORE?

13:31.811 --> 13:34.980
NO, I'M PUTTING MY CAREER
ON THE BACK BURNER FOR NOW.

13:35.014 --> 13:37.817
ARE YOU DOING ANY WRITING
JUST FOR YOURSELF, THOUGH?

13:37.850 --> 13:40.519
YEAH, YEAH.
I WROTE A GROCERY LIST TODAY.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.022
NICE.

13:42.054 --> 13:44.591
YOU SHOULD START
WRITING AGAIN.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.126
SHE WROTE
SOME PERSONAL STUFF
FOR THE PAPER

13:47.159 --> 13:49.062
AND IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.599
OH, I GOTTA GET GOING.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.600
UM, ARE YOU GUYS
GOING TO STAY LONGER?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.469
NO, NO, NO,
THIS IS-- THIS IS ON ME.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.604
THANK YOU.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.972
SO WHERE ARE YOU
HEADING OFF TO, APRIL?

14:00.005 --> 14:02.008
I'M GOING
WEDDING-DRESS SHOPPING.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.443
AH.

14:04.476 --> 14:07.279
WELL, I WOULD GO
WITH A WHITE ONE.

14:07.313 --> 14:08.847
(laughs)

14:08.881 --> 14:10.549
THANK YOU.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.619
-Sara: IS THAT WHAT THAT IS?
-(all giggling)

14:12.851 --> 14:14.486
OH!

14:14.520 --> 14:17.157
-(giggles)
-I PROMISED MYSELF

14:17.190 --> 14:20.393
I WOULDN'T CRY
ON THE FIRST DRESS.

14:20.427 --> 14:23.163
I DON'T KNOW.
IS IT ME, THOUGH?

14:23.196 --> 14:25.631
ARE YOU ENTERING
A BEAUTY PAGEANT?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.433
YEAH, I THINK
WE CAN DO BETTER.

14:27.466 --> 14:29.568
THIS ONE
HAS SOME DESIGN FLAWS,
AND THAT'S ALL I CAN SEE.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.239
ALL I CAN SEE
ARE MY PORT SCARS.

14:32.272 --> 14:35.341
EXCUSE ME, DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN FIND SOME DRESSES
THAT WOULD COVER THESE?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.409
UM, SURE.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.578
LET ME SEE
WHAT I CAN FIND FOR YOU.

14:39.613 --> 14:40.879
AND MORE CHAMPAGNE.

14:40.913 --> 14:42.514
JUST KEEP IT COMING.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.650
Sara:
HEY, THERE YOU ARE.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.952
YOU'VE GOT
THE INVITATIONS, RIGHT?

14:46.986 --> 14:51.191
NO, NO I DIDN'T.
BECAUSE I WAS SAYING GOODBYE
TO MY FRIENDS FOR MAYBE EVER.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.259
THE ONES I PICKED UP
YESTERDAY WERE MISSPELLED.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.361
I'LL GET THE REPRINTS
AFTER THIS.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.029
COOL.
WELL, THANK YOU.

14:57.062 --> 15:00.133
YOU GUYS READY
TO MODEL SOME
BRIDESMAID DRESSES?

15:00.166 --> 15:02.335
-YEAH.
-YOU CAN TRY ON UGLY ONES
FOR FUN.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.370
THAT WILL NOT BE HARD
TO DO HERE.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.605
OKAY, COOL.
LET'S GO.

15:06.639 --> 15:09.576
OH, MOM? I THINK
THAT THEY HAVE SOME DRESSES
FOR YOU AND GRANDMA

15:09.609 --> 15:11.677
-IN THE...
-IN THE OLD LADIES' SECTION.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.514
I BELIEVE THEY CALL IT
THE "LEGACY COLLECTION."

15:14.547 --> 15:16.916
GREAT.
EVEN WORSE.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.384
(laughs)

15:21.354 --> 15:24.658

16:25.652 --> 16:27.986
HOW AM I GOING
TO WALK DOWN THE AISLE?

16:28.020 --> 16:30.623
NO, NO, NO.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.057
OH, MY GOD.

16:32.091 --> 16:33.659
AH, FINE, BRIDEZILLA.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.628
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
ON THE LEGACIES.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.263
I'M TRYING ON ANOTHER ONE.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.998
I'M READY FOR ANOTHER TOO,

16:39.032 --> 16:41.334
BUT I THINK MY PORT
SCARED THE SALESGIRL.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.504
-SHE NEVER CAME BACK.
-I'M SURE SHE JUST FORGOT.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.004
UM, HOLD ON.

16:48.674 --> 16:52.578
HI. UM, EXCUSE ME,
CAN YOU HELP MY SISTER?

16:54.013 --> 16:56.415
OF COURSE.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.653
THAT DRESS
LOOKS GORGEOUS ON YOU.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.723
MAYBE NOT WITH THAT SCARF,
THOUGH.

17:04.758 --> 17:06.192
LET'S TRY A VEIL.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.401
I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK I CAN WEAR THAT.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.403
OH, RIGHT.

17:16.435 --> 17:19.806
UM, LET ME SEE
WHAT WE HAVE IN THE BACK.

17:20.038 --> 17:23.710
MAYBE A HAT OR...

17:23.742 --> 17:26.679
OKAY, SHE SUCKS.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.582
UM, LET ME--
LET ME TRY TO FIND
SOMEONE ELSE.

17:29.615 --> 17:32.085
IT MIGHT
TAKE A MINUTE, THOUGH.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.253
'CAUSE I CAN'T WALK.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.755
(laughs)

17:38.791 --> 17:41.326
UM, EXCUSE ME.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.699
OH, UH...

17:50.103 --> 17:52.638
SORRY.
UH, NEVER-- NEVER MIND.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.544
-(grunts)
-YOU OKAY, SWEETIE?

17:57.576 --> 18:00.113
YEAH.

18:01.847 --> 18:05.351
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
JUST OPEN YOUR MIND
TO THE TWO-PIECE.

18:05.384 --> 18:08.153
NO, NATALIE.
JAKE COHEN IS HERE.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.355
YOU KNOW, THE GUY.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.357
THE GUY
WHO GOT ME PREGNANT.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.093
IT WAS BAD ENOUGH
SEEING HIS PHOTOS

18:14.126 --> 18:16.596
IN THE CHARTON TROPHY CASE
EVERY DAY.

18:16.628 --> 18:18.263
NO, NATALIE, PLEASE.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.767
HEY!
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID,
YOU LITTLE PUNK.

18:20.799 --> 18:21.800
WHOA.
WHAT THE HELL?

18:21.835 --> 18:23.435
YOU BETTER MAKE SURE
HE WEARS A CONDOM.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.737
JAKE, WHAT IS SHE
TALKING ABOUT?

18:24.770 --> 18:26.873
GET HIM, NATALIE!

18:27.105 --> 18:28.141
MOM. WHO IS THAT?

18:28.173 --> 18:30.742
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST LIKE FIGHTS.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.779
GUYS, WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:33.813 --> 18:36.682
UM, NOTHING.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:36.715 --> 18:39.184
-BREN, ARE YOU OKAY?
-YEAH. YEAH, I'M FINE.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.820
I JUST, UM...
I'M GONNA GO CHANGE

18:41.855 --> 18:44.190
AND I HAVE TO GO
PICK UP THE INVITATIONS

18:44.223 --> 18:46.859
'CAUSE THE STORE
IS GOING TO CLOSE, SO...

18:56.903 --> 18:58.403
HEY.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.375
HEY, NOW THAT WE'RE ALONE,

19:03.409 --> 19:07.145
COULD YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED OVER THERE?

19:07.180 --> 19:10.916
-THAT WAS THE GUY.
-OH.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.920
THE GUY WHO...

19:14.153 --> 19:18.156
YEAH. KNOCKED HER UP
AND PAID HER HUSH MONEY
TO GET AN ABORTION.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.859
WHAT?
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

19:20.894 --> 19:23.496
TWO YEARS AGO.
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

19:23.529 --> 19:25.498
NO.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.232
BUT SHE TOLD YOU?

19:27.267 --> 19:31.637
GOD, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY IT ALL JUDGEY LIKE THAT.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.172
ARE WE DOING OKAY
BACK HERE?

19:33.205 --> 19:35.575
NO, WE'RE NOT DOING OKAY.

19:35.607 --> 19:38.677
ACTUALLY, WEREN'T YOU THE ONE
THAT WAS HELPING ME BEFORE?

19:38.711 --> 19:42.181
UM, MAYBE.

19:42.214 --> 19:43.549
IT WAS YOU, YEAH.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.786
I'M SORRY.
IT GOT REALLY BUSY.

19:46.818 --> 19:49.756
WHAT? ARE YOU AFRAID OF ME
BECAUSE I HAVE CANCER?

19:49.788 --> 19:51.758
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT CONTAGIOUS
OR ANYTHING.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.326
YOU DON'T HAVE TO AVOID ME.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.528
AND YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
HAD CANCER?

19:55.561 --> 19:57.829
MY FIANCE, LEO HENDRIE.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.967
YEAH. IT'S A SHAME
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
TAKE MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE,

20:01.200 --> 20:04.871
'CAUSE HE TOLD ME
I COULD HAVE WHATEVER
I WANTED.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.998
(phone beeps)

20:41.007 --> 20:44.277
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU RAGED AT THOSE CHICKS
AT THE BRIDAL STORE.

20:44.309 --> 20:48.780
IT WAS SO  PRETTY WOMAN,
MINUS THE BEING-A-HOOKER PART,
PLUS CANCER.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.284
PLUS A LITTLE SISTER
WHO HIDES MAJOR SECRETS
FROM ME.

20:51.317 --> 20:52.919
I STILL THINK
IT'S JUST SO SAD

20:52.951 --> 20:55.454
SHE FELT LIKE SHE
HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT
ALL BY HERSELF, YOU KNOW?

20:55.488 --> 20:58.458
I KNOW.
AND I GET WHY SHE WOULDN'T
WANT TO TELL MOM OR GRANDMA,

20:58.490 --> 21:01.527
BUT SHE DIDN'T TELL HER SISTER?
HER FULL ONE.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.930
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE UPSET SHE TOLD NATALIE
AND NOT YOU,

21:03.962 --> 21:05.999
BUT IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

21:06.031 --> 21:08.334
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
-WELL, YOU KNOW,

21:08.367 --> 21:10.036
NATALIE IS SORT OF
A MESS HERSELF.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.770
SHE'S NOT GOING TO
JUDGE BRENNA FOR ANYTHING.

21:11.804 --> 21:15.273
I WOULDN'T HAVE EITHER.
I WOULDN'T HAVE!

21:15.307 --> 21:17.309
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS,

21:17.343 --> 21:18.944
NATALIE IS MORE
OF A BUDDY TO BRENNA,

21:18.978 --> 21:20.813
AND YOU'RE MORE OF A MOTHER--
WELL, LIKE A--

21:20.846 --> 21:23.449
YOU'RE--
WELL, YOU'RE MORE OF A--

21:23.482 --> 21:25.984
-WELL--
-YOU WERE GOING
TO SAY "MOTHER."

21:26.019 --> 21:28.820
UH... YEAH.

21:31.423 --> 21:35.060
DID YOU WANT A REACTION SHOT
FROM HUNTER THERE?

21:35.294 --> 21:37.963
UH, NO.
NO, I DON'T NEED IT.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.967
HE LOOKS KIND OF CONSTIPATED
IN ALL OF THEM.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.001
(giggles)

21:43.036 --> 21:46.005
HEY, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BLOW YOU OFF

21:46.038 --> 21:47.707
OR ANYTHING YESTERDAY.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.942
I MEAN, I KIND OF FELT
LIKE YOU DID.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.944
YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME
YOU WEREN'T COMING.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.381
WELL, YOU WANTED
A SONG HERE RIGHT?

21:55.414 --> 21:57.016
HOW'S THIS?

21:57.049 --> 22:02.320
♪ OOH OOH OOH OOH OOH,
OOH OOH OOH ♪

22:04.089 --> 22:08.326
OH, MAN.
FORD'S GOING TO HATE THIS.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.028
SO YOU LOVE IT?

22:10.063 --> 22:11.730
YEAH.

22:11.763 --> 22:15.034
ANYWAY, I'M SORRY
FOR WASTING YOUR TIME.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.036
IT'S JUST THAT
BEING MAID OF HONOR

22:17.069 --> 22:19.439
IS TAKING OVER
MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

22:19.471 --> 22:22.075
AND I CAN'T REALLY SAY NO
TO APRIL THESE DAYS.

22:22.107 --> 22:24.644
(phone buzzes)

22:24.676 --> 22:28.114
MMM. AND THERE'S A PERSON
I CAN'T SAY NO TO.

22:28.346 --> 22:31.349
-WHO'S THAT?
-MY EX.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.118
WE'VE BEEN BROKEN UP
FOR A COUPLE MONTHS,

22:33.352 --> 22:34.921
BUT WE'RE STILL FRIENDS,

22:34.953 --> 22:36.756
MOSTLY BECAUSE
SHE'S AN ALCOHOLIC

22:36.788 --> 22:38.691
AND I JUST
WORRY ABOUT HER.

22:38.724 --> 22:41.760
AND I KNOW IT'S NOT
THE SAME AS CANCER, BUT--

22:41.794 --> 22:44.063
I MEAN,
THEY'RE BOTH DISEASES.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.932
I KNOW IT'S COMPLICATED
TO STAY FRIENDS WITH HER,

22:46.965 --> 22:50.435
BUT IT FEELS MESSED UP
TO CUT HER OFF.

22:53.405 --> 22:56.675
OKAY, SO THAT WAS
THE LAST NOTE.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.376
THAT'S IT?

22:58.411 --> 23:01.380
YEAH, EXCEPT TITLES.
BUT WE CAN DO THAT TOMORROW.

23:01.413 --> 23:04.116
UM, TOMORROW IS SATURDAY.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.519
WHATEVER.
IT WON'T TAKE THAT LONG.

23:06.551 --> 23:10.021
AND THEN I'LL OFFICIALLY
BE DONE AT CHARTON.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.525
I KNOW.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.394
BUT, HEY,
AT LEAST IT WON'T BE WEIRD

23:15.428 --> 23:18.163
WHEN WE HANG OUT
BECAUSE I'M YOUR ADVISER.

23:25.671 --> 23:26.972
MMM, AHEM.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.976
SORRY.
UH, SORRY.

23:30.009 --> 23:34.146
UM, I JUST--
I THOUGHT BECAUSE YOU SAID
THAT WE COULD HANG OUT--

23:34.180 --> 23:36.082
I-- I MEANT AS FRIENDS.
I'M SORRY.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.151
BUT I'M JUST--
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN YOU LIKE THAT.

23:38.183 --> 23:40.853
-IT'S OKAY, YOU DON'T--
-JUST TRUST ME,

23:40.886 --> 23:42.954
IT'S BETTER TO BE
WITH SOMEONE YOUR OWN AGE.

23:42.989 --> 23:45.090
RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHO YOU ARE

23:45.124 --> 23:46.959
AND THERE'S SO MUCH
YOU DON'T KNOW.

23:46.992 --> 23:48.560
I MEAN, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.563
AND THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.097
-BUT--
-NO, I GET IT. I GET IT.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.800
I'M JUST--
I'M GONNA HEAD OUT.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.470
OKAY.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW?

24:06.846 --> 24:09.582
THANK YOU
FOR KEEPING ME FED ALL DAY.

24:09.615 --> 24:12.184
HOW IS YOUR RAVIOLI
ALWAYS SO GOOD?

24:12.218 --> 24:15.153
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I DO?
I TAKE A BIT OF THE PASTA WATER

24:15.188 --> 24:16.888
AND THEN I PUT IT
IN THE SAUCE.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.458
I MEAN, IT MAKES
A HUGE DIFFERENCE.

24:19.491 --> 24:21.027
SO THE--
THE OPEN HOUSE WENT WELL?

24:21.059 --> 24:23.962
YES. I THINK I'M GOING
TO GET AN OFFER.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.664
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

24:25.698 --> 24:28.467
I WAS SO GOOD.
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.736
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR
SOME OF MY SPIEL?

24:30.769 --> 24:33.038
-YEAH, GO FOR IT.
-OKAY.

24:33.072 --> 24:36.008
"IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR A GREAT HOME,

24:36.041 --> 24:38.044
"LOOK NO FURTHER.

24:38.076 --> 24:41.047
"NOW THIS PLACE MAY BE
A BIT OF A PROJECT,

24:41.079 --> 24:43.782
BUT IT'S GOT GREAT BONES."
THAT MEANS IT'S WELL-BUILT,

24:43.816 --> 24:46.551
WITH A SOLID ROOF
AND A GOOD FOUNDATION.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.221
"IT'S THE PERFECT
FIXER-UPPER

24:48.253 --> 24:50.655
"FOR A FAMILY'S FIRST HOME.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.657
"IT'S GOT TONS
OF AVAILABLE LIGHT.

24:52.692 --> 24:57.163
"IT'S SPACIOUS
WITH ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS
TO DIE FOR..."

24:57.195 --> 24:59.865
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT ELSE I SAID.

24:59.898 --> 25:01.634
I WAS HIGH ON ADRENALINE.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.002
THAT WAS GREAT, THOUGH.
I'M TEMPTED TO BUY
THE HOUSE MYSELF.

25:04.036 --> 25:06.204
WELL, YOU SHOULD BUY A HOUSE
LIKE THAT.

25:06.239 --> 25:08.240
I MEAN, NOW WITH
YOUR SECOND BOOK COMING OUT,

25:08.273 --> 25:10.175
YOU CAN AFFORD
NOT TO HAVE A ROOMMATE.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.911
YEAH, BUT GRAHAM
IS NEVER HERE ANYWAY.

25:11.943 --> 25:13.179
I MOSTLY HAVE
THE PLACE TO MYSELF.

25:13.211 --> 25:15.513
I DON'T NEED TO MOVE
INTO A BIGGER PLACE.

25:15.548 --> 25:19.652
WELL, WITH A FACE LIKE YOURS,
YOU WON'T BE SINGLE
FOR VERY LONG.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.989
SO ARE YOU--
ARE DATING ANYONE?

25:23.021 --> 25:26.826
UH, NO.
I JUST-- I KIND OF STOPPED
SEEING SOMEONE.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.294
-OH.
-YEAH.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.229
WHAT HAPPENED?

25:30.262 --> 25:33.699
UH, ACCORDING TO HER,
I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH APRIL.

25:33.732 --> 25:36.269
DOES SHE KNOW APRIL.
WHY WOULD SHE SAY THAT?

25:36.301 --> 25:39.238
SHE'S HER HALF-SISTER.

25:39.271 --> 25:42.307
-OH, I SEE.
-YEAH.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.542
SO I GUESS YOU HAVE A TYPE.

25:44.576 --> 25:46.979
IT'S NOT TRUE, THOUGH.
APRIL AND I ARE JUST FRIENDS.

25:47.012 --> 25:50.215
AND IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE'S AVAILABLE ANYWAY.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.983
RIGHT.

25:55.121 --> 25:57.222
-ONE, TWO, THREE--
-ONE-- OH!

25:57.256 --> 25:59.892
(Emma laughs)

25:59.925 --> 26:02.560
OKAY, LEO.

26:02.595 --> 26:03.930
-I--
-IT'S ALL RIGHT.

26:03.962 --> 26:06.932
REMEMBER-- ONE, TWO, THREE.
ONE, TWO--

26:06.965 --> 26:09.035
-RIGHT, SORRY. OKAY.
-ONE, TWO, THREE,

26:09.067 --> 26:11.136
-ONE, TWO, THREE--
-YEP. OH!

26:11.170 --> 26:12.971
(Emma laughing)

26:13.005 --> 26:15.574
-GOD, I'M SORRY.
-MOM, IT'S NOT FUNNY.

26:15.607 --> 26:17.910
WELL, LET'S AGREE
TO DISAGREE.

26:17.943 --> 26:20.746
SO, WAIT, HOLD ON.
IS IT MY RIGHT FOOT FORWARD,

26:20.779 --> 26:22.048
YOUR LEFT FOOT BACK?

26:22.080 --> 26:24.049
WAIT, I THINK--
ISN'T IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

26:24.083 --> 26:26.885
I, UM...
I DON'T KNOW.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.586
THIS IS CONFUSING.
LET ME--

26:28.621 --> 26:29.821
LET ME TRY LEADING APRIL
FOR A SECOND.

26:29.855 --> 26:31.289
-HERE, YOU SIT DOWN.
-YEAH.

26:31.324 --> 26:33.259
-OKAY, YOU READY?
-OKAY. MM-HMM.

26:33.291 --> 26:37.663
-ONE, TWO, THREE...
-WELL, THIS ISN'T
AS MUCH FUN NOW.

26:37.697 --> 26:40.165
I'M GOING OUT WITH SAM.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.334
DON'T WAIT UP FOR ME.

26:41.366 --> 26:42.734
-ALL RIGHT.
-OKAY.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.236
-ONE, TWO, THREE...
-OOH!

26:44.269 --> 26:45.770
Sara:
OH, BRENNA.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.373
I CAN TAKE THOSE INVITES
OFF YOUR HANDS IF YOU WANT.

26:47.605 --> 26:49.709
I'M GOING TO BE
GOING TO THE POST OFFICE
TOMORROW MORNING ANYWAY.

26:54.012 --> 26:55.614
I LEFT THEM AT CHARTON.

26:55.647 --> 26:57.883
WHAT?
WHY WERE YOU EVEN THERE?

26:57.916 --> 27:00.353
I KNOW I SCREWED UP.
OKAY?

27:00.385 --> 27:03.990
BIG SHOCKER.
AND I KNOW THAT NOBODY CARES,

27:04.022 --> 27:06.659
BUT I'VE HAD
A REALLY BAD WEEK.

27:06.692 --> 27:09.828
AND I SERIOUSLY CAN'T HANDLE
A LECTURE RIGHT NOW.

27:09.862 --> 27:12.064
I'M GOING TO NATALIE'S.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.369
YOU CAN STAY HERE
AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.372
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM.

27:19.404 --> 27:22.641
BETH'S BEEN WORKING
CRAZY HOURS.

27:22.674 --> 27:25.877
THAT EXPLAINS WHY
I'M MAID OF HONOR BY DEFAULT.

27:25.911 --> 27:27.880
UGH!
THIS IS WHY I HATE WEDDINGS.

27:27.913 --> 27:29.280
SO MUCH UNNECESSARY DRAMA.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.384
I LIKE
THE OPRAH-AND-STEDMAN MODEL.

27:31.416 --> 27:33.919
THEY CHOOSE TO BE TOGETHER
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

27:33.952 --> 27:36.989
THERE'S NO CONTRACT
TELLING THEM THEY HAVE TO BE.

27:37.022 --> 27:39.357
THAT'S REALLY ROMANTIC OF YOU.

27:39.392 --> 27:41.326
-I HAVE MY MOMENTS.
-(door opens)

27:41.359 --> 27:43.328
WHOA, BETH'S HOME EARLY.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.963
OH, APRIL.

27:44.997 --> 27:48.433
-HEY.
-ARE YOU HERE TO FIRE ME
AS MAID OF HONOR?

27:48.666 --> 27:50.836
NO. LOOK, I KNOW
MOM'S BEEN STRESSING OUT
ABOUT THE WEDDING,

27:50.869 --> 27:52.837
BUT NONE OF THAT
IS COMING FROM ME.

27:52.872 --> 27:55.807
I RESERVE MY TANTRUMS
FOR THE STAFF AT WHITER SHADE
OF VEIL.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.143
WHAT?

27:57.175 --> 28:00.945
OH, YEAH.
GIRL LOST IT
ON THE SALES BITCHES.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.414
TRUE STORY.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.383
(laughs)
I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED THAT.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.885
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE INVITATIONS.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.421
I'LL GET THEM ON MONDAY.

28:08.453 --> 28:11.323
GOD, IT'S GOING TO SUCK
GOING BACK TO CHARTON.

28:11.356 --> 28:14.059
I ALREADY SAID GOODBYE
TO EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING.

28:14.093 --> 28:15.428
WELL, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO ON MONDAY,

28:15.461 --> 28:18.696
-LET'S GO TONIGHT.
-THE SCHOOL IS CLOSED.

28:18.730 --> 28:20.031
SO?
WE CAN FIND A WAY IN.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.700
I MEAN, SURE.

28:21.733 --> 28:24.103
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO,
EXPEL ME?

28:24.135 --> 28:26.204
EXACTLY.
LET'S GO.

28:28.106 --> 28:31.143
-YOU WANT TO COME?
-UH, YEAH.

28:31.176 --> 28:33.378
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M MISSING THIS.

28:41.487 --> 28:45.124
-WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.
-THANKS, YEAH.

28:45.156 --> 28:47.192
I FEEL LIKE ONE
OF THE GIRLS NOW.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.295
SORRY YOU HAD TO WITNESS THAT.

28:49.327 --> 28:51.430
WE DIDN'T EVEN
GET TO FIGURE OUT YOUR DANCE.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.432
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT YOUTUBE IS FOR.

28:53.465 --> 28:56.734
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET GOING.

28:56.769 --> 28:59.371
SO, I DON'T--
IS APRIL STAYING
WITH YOU TONIGHT

28:59.404 --> 29:01.073
OR IS SHE COMING HOME?

29:01.106 --> 29:04.876
I-- SORRY, I GUESS I--
I SHOULDN'T SAY "HOME."

29:04.910 --> 29:06.479
HOME IS WITH YOU NOW.

29:06.511 --> 29:08.814
WELL, I THINK
SHE IS STAYING WITH ME,

29:08.847 --> 29:12.218
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO COOK, SO SHE'LL
ALWAYS END UP BACK HERE.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.919
(chuckles)

29:13.952 --> 29:16.855
I GUESS I'M JUST
USED TO BEING THE ONE
TAKING CARE OF HER.

29:16.888 --> 29:18.490
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO STOP.

29:18.523 --> 29:21.493
THERE'S ROOM
FOR BOTH OF US.

29:21.527 --> 29:23.061
THE GIRL LOVES ATTENTION.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.497
(chuckles)

29:26.397 --> 29:29.201
SHOULD WE GIVE YOUR BOX STEP
ONE MORE TRY BEFORE YOU LEAVE?

29:29.234 --> 29:31.836
SURE, YEAH.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.838
I'LL-- I'LL START US OFF.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.473
OKAY.
WE'RE GOING BACK.

29:35.508 --> 29:37.009
BACK, RIGHT. OKAY.

29:37.041 --> 29:38.042
(laughs)

29:38.076 --> 29:40.078
READY?

29:40.112 --> 29:43.781
ONE, TWO, THREE,
ONE, TWO, THREE...

29:43.816 --> 29:45.851
ONE--
HA! IT'S HAPPENING.

29:45.884 --> 29:47.552
-DON'T JINX US NOW.
-(laughs)

29:47.786 --> 29:50.556
SEE? YOU JUST
GOT TO LET SOMEONE ELSE
TAKE THE LEAD SOMETIMES.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.193
(humming)

29:57.229 --> 30:00.798
JANITOR DUDE'S
GOT A NICE ASS.

30:00.833 --> 30:02.433
(whispering)
WHAT? NATALIE, FOCUS.

30:02.468 --> 30:05.371
WHEN HE GOES BACK INSIDE,
YOU NEED TO FOLLOW HIM.

30:05.403 --> 30:06.872
ARE YOU--
ARE YOU WATCHING?

30:06.905 --> 30:08.073
UH, YEAH.

30:08.106 --> 30:10.576
CAN'T TAKE MY EYES
OFF THAT THING.

30:10.808 --> 30:12.478
GO, GO, GO.

30:18.150 --> 30:21.487
YEAH.
NO, NO, NO, I UNDERSTAND.

30:21.519 --> 30:23.821
WE'LL KEEP LOOKING.

30:23.855 --> 30:25.523
TALK SOON.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.593
(sighs)

30:27.826 --> 30:30.563
THE HOUSE DIDN'T SELL.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.096
DAMN.

30:32.131 --> 30:35.567
YEAH.
THAT'S A BIT OF A BUMMER.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.836
OH, WELL.

30:37.869 --> 30:40.205
I'M STILL PROUD AS HELL
OF MYSELF.

30:40.239 --> 30:43.409
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS,
I GOT TO SPEND ALL DAY
WITH MY SON.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.277
(laughs)

30:45.310 --> 30:49.214
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME WE SPENT
THIS MUCH TIME TOGETHER.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.584
I MISS THAT.

30:51.616 --> 30:54.286
I DO TOO.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.457
YOU KNOW WE'RE OKAY NOW,
RIGHT?

30:58.490 --> 31:00.593
WELL, I HOPE SO.

31:00.625 --> 31:04.529
YOU KNOW,
THESE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS
HAVE BEEN HARD.

31:04.563 --> 31:08.567
BUT THERE WERE SO MANY
GOOD YEARS BEFORE THAT.

31:08.601 --> 31:12.438
I KNOW IT WASN'T EASY FOR YOU
TO RAISE US ON YOUR OWN.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.573
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU
ENOUGH CREDIT FOR THAT.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.875
HMM.

31:16.909 --> 31:20.045
WELL, I GUESS
YOU CAN THANK YOUR DAD

31:20.078 --> 31:22.548
FOR TEACHING YOU
HOW NOT TO BEHAVE

31:22.580 --> 31:24.549
WHEN YOU GET MARRIED.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.884
YEAH,
IF THAT EVER HAPPENS.

31:26.919 --> 31:29.555
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING
TO GET MARRIED.

31:29.587 --> 31:31.557
AND WHEN YOU DO,

31:31.589 --> 31:35.294
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT HER
THE WAY YOU LOOK AT APRIL.

31:35.326 --> 31:37.162
-MOM, COME ON,
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.
-"WE'RE JUST FRIENDS."

31:37.195 --> 31:39.064
I KNOW, I KNOW.
(laughs)

31:39.097 --> 31:41.599
WELL, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE FRIENDS WITH THE PERSON
YOU MARRY, RIGHT?

31:42.601 --> 31:45.604
REMEMBER, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WAIT TO MEET HER

31:45.637 --> 31:48.574
TO GO FOR THE THINGS
YOU WANT IN LIFE.

31:53.979 --> 31:55.681
(whispering)
WHERE ARE THE INVITATIONS?

31:55.913 --> 31:57.915
END OF THE HALL.

32:07.226 --> 32:08.993
ISN'T THAT HIM?

32:09.028 --> 32:10.996
-YEAH.
-(door opens)

32:11.029 --> 32:12.998
(man talking)

32:13.031 --> 32:15.000
BETTER BE THE HOT JANITOR.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.001
(second man talking)

32:17.036 --> 32:19.704
(keys jangling, door opens)

32:26.077 --> 32:29.013
OH, MY GOD.
WE DID IT!

32:29.048 --> 32:31.083
I TOLD YOU
IT WOULD WORK OUT.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.986
YEAH, THANKS TO NATALIE.
YOU WERE SO FAST BACK THERE.

32:34.019 --> 32:36.488
I JUST IMAGINED BECKHAM
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR.

32:36.521 --> 32:38.289
(both laughing)

32:38.324 --> 32:39.490
AH!

32:39.525 --> 32:42.294
DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
A FAVORITE-SISTER CONTEST.

32:42.327 --> 32:43.729
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

32:43.961 --> 32:46.999
NOTHING.
I JUST FEEL OUT OF THE LOOP
WITH YOU TWO SOMETIMES.

32:47.031 --> 32:48.567
APRIL.

32:48.599 --> 32:50.702
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO ASKED ME
TO TAKE CARE OF BRENNA

32:50.736 --> 32:52.237
WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL.

32:52.270 --> 32:54.740
DID YOU NOT WANT US
TO BE CLOSE?

32:54.972 --> 32:57.308
YOU ASKED HER
TO TAKE CARE OF ME?

32:57.343 --> 33:00.112
-WHY?
-OR IS THIS LIKE
WHEN YOU SAID

33:00.144 --> 33:02.013
YOU WERE OKAY
WITH ME DATING DOMINIC

33:02.047 --> 33:04.215
-AS LONG AS NO REAL FEELINGS
WERE INVOLVED?
-OH, MY GOD.

33:04.249 --> 33:06.417
YOU GUYS BREAKING UP
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

33:06.451 --> 33:10.055
EVERYTHING HAS TO DO
WITH YOU.

33:10.088 --> 33:11.155
WHAT?

33:11.190 --> 33:13.224
BRENNA, WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

33:13.258 --> 33:15.426
NEVER MIND.
LET'S JUST GO HOME.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.596
-(alarm beeps)
-WHAT WAS THAT?

33:17.628 --> 33:20.199
IT'S THE ALARM.

33:20.231 --> 33:21.700
(beeping)

33:24.269 --> 33:26.672
(beeps, door latches)

33:26.704 --> 33:29.208
WE'RE STUCK HERE.

33:34.579 --> 33:37.115
COME ON.

33:37.148 --> 33:39.585
-WHAT IF WE'RE
STUCK HERE ALL WEEKEND?
-Brenna: WE WON'T BE.

33:39.617 --> 33:42.320
TRUST ME.
I'VE HAD SATURDAY
DETENTION BEFORE.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.589
ARE YOU SURE?
'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE MY MEDS

33:44.623 --> 33:46.357
-OR A PHONE CHARGER. WHAT IF--
-APRIL!

33:46.392 --> 33:48.326
I GET IT!
YOU'RE SICK.

33:48.359 --> 33:50.328
-WE KNOW!
-WHOA.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.431
THAT'S WHY I FEEL
LIKE I CAN'T TELL YOU
ANYTHING,

33:52.463 --> 33:54.400
BECAUSE NO MATTER
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH,

33:54.432 --> 33:56.234
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
SOMETHING WORSE.

33:56.268 --> 33:57.368
SO WHAT?

33:57.403 --> 33:59.404
YOU CAN STILL TELL ME
YOUR PROBLEMS.

33:59.438 --> 34:02.775
WHY? SO YOU CAN TRY
TO FIX ME, LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

34:02.807 --> 34:04.643
I DON'T TRY TO FIX YOU.

34:04.675 --> 34:06.377
YEAH, YOU DO.

34:06.412 --> 34:09.280
WHEN DAD DIED,
YOU MOVED BACK HOME
TO TAKE CARE OF US.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.382
WHEN I STARTED
GETTING INTO TROUBLE
AFTER THAT,

34:11.416 --> 34:13.284
YOU HELPED MOM
FIND CHARTON.

34:13.318 --> 34:16.054
WHEN MOM PULLED ME OUT
OF HONOR, YOU ASKED ME
TO BE YOUR MAID OF HONOR.

34:16.088 --> 34:18.056
I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE THAT.

34:18.090 --> 34:20.391
I DO, BUT...

34:20.425 --> 34:23.394
SOMETIMES I JUST WANT YOU
TO LISTEN LIKE NATALIE DOES.

34:23.429 --> 34:26.231
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T REALIZE
ASKING YOU TO WATCH OUT
FOR BRENNA

34:26.264 --> 34:28.666
MEANT KEEPING
HUGE SECRETS FROM ME.

34:28.699 --> 34:31.235
WHAT HUGE SECRETS?

34:31.269 --> 34:35.507
I'M SORRY.
I THOUGHT SHE ALREADY KNEW
ABOUT JAKE.

34:37.342 --> 34:39.677
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

34:39.710 --> 34:42.648
DOES MOM KNOW NOW?

34:42.681 --> 34:46.485
-NO! I WOULDN'T TELL--
-NATALIE, WHY DID YOU
TELL HER THAT?

34:47.619 --> 34:51.523
ARE YOU HAPPY, APRIL?
NOW SHE HATES BOTH OF US.

34:57.728 --> 35:00.431
WELL, IN THE SPIRIT
OF NOT KEEPING SECRETS,

35:00.465 --> 35:02.300
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE--

35:02.333 --> 35:05.336
I FOUND DAD'S
UNPUBLISHED MANUSCRIPT.

35:05.369 --> 35:07.438
WHAT? WHERE?

35:07.472 --> 35:09.507
IN STORAGE.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.409
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FICTION,

35:11.443 --> 35:13.878
BUT THE CHARACTERS
ARE US.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.614
CLIFF'S NOTES VERSION--

35:15.646 --> 35:17.416
I'M SIMPLE,

35:17.449 --> 35:19.585
BRENNA IS A BAND-AID
ON A BROKEN MARRIAGE,

35:19.617 --> 35:21.152
APRIL IS THE GOLDEN CHILD.

35:21.186 --> 35:24.456
YOU GUYS,
OUR DAD IS THE WORST.

35:24.489 --> 35:26.324
OH, MY GOD.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.527
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE WAS WRITING ANOTHER BOOK.

35:28.559 --> 35:31.163
YEAH, WELL,
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIM.

35:31.195 --> 35:32.530
HELLO.

35:32.563 --> 35:35.900
OKAY, LOOK,
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP SECRETS

35:36.134 --> 35:38.135
FROM EACH OTHER
LIKE DAD DID.

35:38.170 --> 35:39.505
WHAT WAS GOING ON
WITH YOU THIS WEEK

35:39.538 --> 35:40.905
THAT YOU FELT
YOU COULDN'T TELL ME?

35:41.139 --> 35:43.141
NOTHING.
I WAS JUST GOING TO TRY

35:43.175 --> 35:45.210
TO ENTER
THIS STUPID FILM FESTIVAL,

35:45.244 --> 35:47.913
AND I COULDN'T GET IT DONE
ON TOP OF BEING MAID OF HONOR.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.916
-IT'S FINE.
-NO, I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
THAT WAS FOR YOU.

35:51.148 --> 35:53.150
IS THERE ANY WAY
YOU CAN STILL MAKE
THE DEADLINE?

35:54.418 --> 35:58.289
WELL, NOW I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT TO.

36:03.728 --> 36:08.166
OKAY, NOW THAT
WE'RE JUST PUTTING IT
ALL OUT THERE,

36:08.199 --> 36:11.168
SOMETHING ELSE
HAPPENED TODAY.

36:13.739 --> 36:17.876
I CAME BACK HERE
TO TRY TO FINISH
THE MOVIE

36:17.909 --> 36:20.244
WITH MY FILM ADVISER MARGO.

36:20.278 --> 36:23.248
I TRIED TO KISS HER.

36:23.282 --> 36:27.251
DON'T WORRY.
SHE TOTALLY REJECTED ME.

36:27.286 --> 36:30.389
I'VE LITERALLY NEVER
BEEN SO HUMILIATED.

36:30.422 --> 36:34.192
SO THAT'S THE REAL REASON
I DIDN'T WANT TO COME BACK
TO CHARTON.

36:34.226 --> 36:36.193
SHE OFFERED TO MEET ME
HERE TOMORROW,

36:36.228 --> 36:38.829
BUT I'D RATHER JUST SKIP
THE WHOLE FESTIVAL

36:38.864 --> 36:41.233
THAN SEE HER AGAIN.

36:41.266 --> 36:44.202
NOW WE CAN JUST
SNEAK OUT IN THE MORNING

36:44.235 --> 36:46.204
BEFORE SHE GETS HERE.

36:46.237 --> 36:47.672
BEEN THERE.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.342
YEP.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.476
WHO WAS YOURS, APRIL?

36:52.510 --> 36:55.414
-UM, A COLLEGE T.A.
-(both laugh)

36:55.447 --> 36:57.416
-YOU?
-BABYSITTER.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.983
(all laughing)

37:00.485 --> 37:02.387
OKAY, WHO WANTS TO SLIDE
AROUND THE HALLS

37:02.420 --> 37:04.422
LIKE WE'RE IN  BREAKFAST CLUB?

37:06.958 --> 37:10.561
OH, MY GOD.
SOMETIMES I HATE
BEING THE OLDEST.

37:13.331 --> 37:16.434
-(keys jangling)
-(students chattering)

37:18.804 --> 37:22.306
YOU GUYS, SOMEBODY'S HERE.
WE HAVE TO GET UP.

37:22.340 --> 37:24.275
Natalie:
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

37:24.309 --> 37:26.844
I DON'T LET ANYBODY SEE ME
WITH MY HAIR LIKE THIS.

37:26.878 --> 37:28.480
PERKS OF NOT HAVING MUCH.

37:29.780 --> 37:33.284
HEY.
YOU'RE HERE EARLY

37:33.318 --> 37:35.320
WITH, UM, PEOPLE.

37:35.353 --> 37:38.389
YEAH, SORRY.
IT'S A LONG STORY.

37:38.422 --> 37:42.793
UM, MARGO,
THESE ARE MY SISTERS APRIL
AND NATALIE.

37:42.827 --> 37:45.329
UM, I'M GOING
TO HEAD HOME, BREN.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.664
ARE YOU COMING WITH?

37:46.697 --> 37:49.400
UM, I-- I THINK
I'M GOING TO STAY HERE

37:49.434 --> 37:51.969
AND FINISH THE MOVIE.

37:55.039 --> 37:56.474
-SEE YOU GUYS LATER.
-YEAH.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.050
THERE YOU ARE.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.320
I WAS GETTING WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

38:08.353 --> 38:10.621
SORRY.
MY PHONE DIED.

38:10.655 --> 38:12.324
-WHERE'S BRENNA?
-OH, SHE'S FINE.

38:12.356 --> 38:14.059
SHE JUST HAD
A FEW THINGS SHE NEEDED
TO TAKE CARE OF TODAY,

38:14.291 --> 38:15.594
BUT SHE'LL BE HOME LATER.

38:15.626 --> 38:18.429
ANY INTEREST IN HELPING ME
ADDRESS THE INVITATIONS?

38:18.463 --> 38:21.365
WELL, I THOUGHT THESE
WERE AT THE--

38:21.400 --> 38:25.003
DO NOT WORRY ABOUT IT.
(chuckles)

38:26.637 --> 38:30.442
-WHAT DO YOU THINK?
-I LIKE THEM.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.746
I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.447
BRENNA, I'M SORRY IF I--

38:36.481 --> 38:38.315
NO, I-- I GET IT.

38:38.349 --> 38:40.485
I GET THAT THERE'S A LOT
THAT I DON'T KNOW YET

38:40.518 --> 38:42.853
BECAUSE I'M YOUNG.

38:42.887 --> 38:45.389
BUT I KNOW MORE
THAN YOU THINK.

38:45.423 --> 38:49.994
I'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
THESE LAST FEW YEARS.

38:50.027 --> 38:53.431
YOU ALREADY KNOW
ABOUT APRIL,

38:53.465 --> 38:56.467
BUT, UM,

38:56.501 --> 38:58.769
I ALSO LOST MY DAD.

38:58.804 --> 39:03.407
AND I FOUND OUT
THAT HE HAD A SECRET FAMILY.

39:03.442 --> 39:06.043
AND I MET MY NEW SISTER.

39:06.077 --> 39:10.414
AND I DONATED STEM CELLS
TO A STRANGER.

39:10.449 --> 39:14.385
EVEN THOUGH YESTERDAY
WAS REALLY EMBARRASSING,

39:14.418 --> 39:17.021
AND I'M VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
RIGHT NOW,

39:17.054 --> 39:21.760
I KNOW THAT
I'VE BEEN THROUGH WAY WORSE

39:21.793 --> 39:25.362
AND I'LL BE FINE.

39:25.396 --> 39:27.699
AND I CAN TAKE THIS
FROM HERE TOO

39:27.733 --> 39:30.034
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE HERE ON A WEEKEND.

40:10.608 --> 40:12.878
(knocking)

40:14.880 --> 40:16.914
IS THAT DAD'S BOOK?

40:16.947 --> 40:19.483
YEAH.
I GOT IT FROM NATALIE.

40:19.518 --> 40:22.186
ARE YOU GOING
TO TELL MOM ABOUT IT?

40:22.420 --> 40:24.755
I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVE TO READ IT FIRST.

40:24.789 --> 40:27.559
AND THEN YOU'LL DECIDE?

40:27.592 --> 40:30.494
AND THEN WE'LL DECIDE.

40:58.123 --> 41:01.025
(typing)

41:12.971 --> 41:14.972
WHO DID JAKE COHEN PISS OFF?

41:23.481 --> 41:27.518
(closing music playing)
