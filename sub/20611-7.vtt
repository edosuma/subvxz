[intense music]

00:05.106 --> 00:09.410
*

00:09.443 --> 00:11.679
- My name is Carl Oliver and
I'm from Gainesville, Florida.

00:11.712 --> 00:15.149
I'm a stay-at-home dad
and a full-time bladesmith.

00:15.183 --> 00:18.052
I've made some crazy hammers,
crazy axes.

00:18.086 --> 00:20.288
My friends always say
if the apocalypse happens,

00:20.321 --> 00:22.123
I'm the first one that
they're gonna come to.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.158
Save the day.

00:24.192 --> 00:28.362
- I am David McConnell,
and I am 38 years old.

00:28.396 --> 00:31.532
I'm a little on the short side,
so that kind of drives me,

00:31.565 --> 00:33.667
especially when
people talk crap.

00:33.701 --> 00:37.071
I want to be able to prove that
I can hang with the big boys.

00:37.105 --> 00:40.741
- My name is Jordan LaMothe.
I'm 21 years old.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.411
I've been making knives about
five or six years.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.813
I often try to
incorporate embellishment

00:45.846 --> 00:47.581
from "Lord of the Rings."

00:47.615 --> 00:49.483
I'm certainly
a "Lord of the Rings" fan.

00:49.517 --> 00:52.320
- My name is Rick Fenlon,
I'm 57 years old,

00:52.353 --> 00:54.088
and I live in
Ponce de Leon, Florida.

00:54.122 --> 00:57.191
I retired as a police officer
in 2006,

00:57.225 --> 00:59.460
and I started bladesmithing
in 2011.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.762
I put my heart and soul
into my blades.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.831
I'm getting emotional
just thinking about it!

01:03.864 --> 01:05.566
My granddaughter can
do this to me, too,

01:05.599 --> 01:08.636
pretty much regularly.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.804
- Good morning bladesmiths,
and welcome to the Forge.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.540
You are here to demonstrate
that you deserve

01:12.573 --> 01:14.542
to be called the
"Forged in Fire" champion

01:14.575 --> 01:17.111
and walk away with
a check for 10 grand.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.479
Let's go ahead and
meet our judges.

01:18.512 --> 01:21.549
World-famous bladesmith,
Jason Knight.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.685
Historic weapons re-creation
specialist, David Baker.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.520
Kali  martial artist and
edge weapons specialist,

01:26.554 --> 01:28.422
Doug Marcaida.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.691
All right, bladesmiths,
we're just gonna jump

01:30.724 --> 01:32.693
right into this today.
We wanna see what you're

01:32.726 --> 01:35.429
actually capable of.
What we're going to do

01:35.463 --> 01:37.731
is take odd shapes of
mystery steel,

01:37.765 --> 01:40.501
and have you make your
signature blade with those.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.236
You will come up one at a time,

01:42.270 --> 01:44.538
in an order that was
randomly chosen

01:44.572 --> 01:47.175
and you will choose
your piece of mystery steel

01:47.208 --> 01:50.278
out of this barrel.
Is anybody nervous yet?

01:50.311 --> 01:52.313
- There's no telling
what's in there.

01:52.346 --> 01:55.349
It could be something easy,
or something that is

01:55.383 --> 01:58.319
impossible to work with.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.921
- Jordan, you're up first.
Choose your steel.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.291
[suspenseful music]

02:03.324 --> 02:06.594
You've chosen 1084 cable.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.530
- 1084 was great for me
because most of my knives

02:09.563 --> 02:12.300
are made out of that steel.
But I've never forged anything

02:12.333 --> 02:15.269
out of this round cable,
so I'm pretty nervous.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.770
- Carl, you're up next.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.939
*

02:18.972 --> 02:21.842
- I pull out the W2
and I'm like, "Oh, hell.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.878
I've gotta forge weld this."
I've never forge welded before.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.780
Not with any kind of success.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.749
- David, you're up.
Choose your steel.

02:28.782 --> 02:32.586
*

02:32.620 --> 02:37.625
- I end up with 1095 cylinders.
9 of 'em, to be exact.

02:37.658 --> 02:41.562
The metal's not difficult.
It's trying to weld a cylinder

02:41.595 --> 02:43.264
to another cylinder.

02:43.297 --> 02:46.500
- Rick. You're up.
Choose your steel.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.736
*

02:48.769 --> 02:51.639
That is a coil of 5160.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.707
- It's just a very
thick piece of steel,

02:53.741 --> 02:56.810
and you have to figure out
some way to get it straight.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.712
- You have ten minutes
to work on your designs.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.681
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

03:00.714 --> 03:01.949
Keep in mind that in the
second round, you'll be

03:01.982 --> 03:03.751
putting handles on
your blades

03:03.784 --> 03:05.619
to turn them into fully
functional weapons.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.988
They will then be tested
for strength and durability

03:08.021 --> 03:10.691
in a terra-cotta tile chop,

03:10.724 --> 03:14.428
and for edge retention
in the tatami mat slice.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.797
Good luck, bladesmiths.
Your ten-minute design window

03:16.830 --> 03:19.400
starts...now.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.535
[rock music]

03:21.569 --> 03:24.438
- My favorite here is the W2.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.240
- And why is that
your favorite, Jason?

03:26.274 --> 03:28.242
- 'cause that is the
ultimate steel on the earth

03:28.276 --> 03:29.977
for making knives out of,
if you know how

03:30.010 --> 03:31.745
to make a knife
out of it.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.447
- So you're saying
there's tricks.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.949
- Basically, when you quench it
in oil--

03:35.983 --> 03:38.252
because if you quench it
in water,

03:38.286 --> 03:40.721
you have about a 75% chance
of it cracking.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.691
- For the challenge, I'm going
to make a chopper.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.859
It should do well on
terra-cotta chop,

03:45.893 --> 03:48.829
'cause it has a thicker spine.
It can take a better blow.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.365
The hardest part is
the forge-welding.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.833
It's something new.
I've never done it before.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.568
So, I just need to
step up my game.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.704
Do the best I can.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.940
- My signature blade,
I would say, is a Viking seax.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.909
I think the seax would be
a good design

04:01.942 --> 04:04.011
because it has
a broken back.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.480
I'm going to make
it with a heavier spine,

04:06.514 --> 04:08.716
and probably a slimmer edge.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.818
So the heaviness will help
get through the terra-cotta,

04:10.851 --> 04:14.488
and the thinner edge will
help with the slicing.

04:14.522 --> 04:19.059
- The design for my blade
is a very large,

04:19.092 --> 04:22.029
straight-back hunter with a
recurve.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.465
The straight-back hunter is
something that

04:24.498 --> 04:25.799
I make quite often.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.568
I think it'll do very well

04:27.601 --> 04:29.403
with the chopping of
the terra-cotta.

04:29.437 --> 04:33.774
It's a pretty
robust blade.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.544
- I'm gonna go for
a design of a camp knife

04:36.577 --> 04:38.379
with a slight recurve.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.581
Recurve is helpful with chopping
because you get

04:40.614 --> 04:42.950
a little bit more bite
in the cut,

04:42.983 --> 04:44.485
and that's really helpful
with cutting something

04:44.518 --> 04:48.422
thick and juicy
like tatami mats.

04:48.456 --> 04:51.692
I'm not a typical 21-year-old.
I'm really ready to prove that

04:51.725 --> 04:54.662
even though I'm young,
I am ready to start a career

04:54.695 --> 04:56.063
as a bladesmith, making
some of the finest knives

04:56.096 --> 04:57.698
in the world.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.700
- Bladesmiths,
drop your pencils.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.069
Your design window is closed.
Your three-hour forge time

05:02.102 --> 05:04.037
starts...now.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.940
[fast-tempo
rock music]

05:06.974 --> 05:08.876
*

05:08.909 --> 05:12.746
- Jordan threw his cable
immediately

05:12.780 --> 05:14.382
into the fire--
he didn't clean it,

05:14.415 --> 05:16.450
he didn't do nothin',
he didn't spray it.

05:16.484 --> 05:19.353
- I've read a lot about
how to make cable Damascus,

05:19.387 --> 05:21.855
and it's gonna be okay.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.957
First thing,
stick it in the forge.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.627
There's not a moment
to lose when it comes to just

05:26.660 --> 05:28.496
heating it up.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.063
- Hey, he's bleedin'.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.865
- He is bleeding.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.134
- I pinched my thumb
in the vise.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.104
A couple minutes in,
and I've already hurt myself.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.707
What am I, like, the young guy
making a fool of himself?

05:39.740 --> 05:42.009
*

05:42.042 --> 05:44.378
- Come on, baby, heat up.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.814
The first thing I gotta do
is uncoil it. I wanna get it

05:46.847 --> 05:49.683
as hot as possible before
I can get it into the pole vise.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.919
- Looks like Rick's got
that coil on.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.054
Yeah, it's already
turning gray.

05:54.087 --> 05:57.691
- Rick is suffering from
not heating the steel hot enough

05:57.725 --> 05:59.760
before he begins
to work with it.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.762
That's not good.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.531
- He's got the leverage
going the wrong direction.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.032
- [groans]

06:05.065 --> 06:06.166
The wrong thing's bendin'.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.002
*

06:09.036 --> 06:11.038
I got the coil spring
in the vise,

06:11.071 --> 06:13.641
and I'm starting to
get somewhere, so now I'm just

06:13.674 --> 06:15.008
really just banging away
on that thing

06:15.042 --> 06:16.944
until I get it straight.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.145
Fightin' me at every step!

06:18.178 --> 06:20.548
*

06:20.581 --> 06:22.115
How the heck am I gonna do
the rest of this challenge now,

06:22.149 --> 06:24.051
after I've expended
almost everything I got

06:24.084 --> 06:28.055
just to get this thing
straightened out?

06:28.088 --> 06:31.725
- It was fraying like crazy.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.995
Time to cut off the end,

06:35.028 --> 06:36.597
weld the thing together

06:36.630 --> 06:37.731
so that it's
not gonna fray.

06:37.765 --> 06:41.869
*

06:41.902 --> 06:44.104
- The hardest part about
using the cylinders is

06:44.137 --> 06:46.740
I have to make them
square first,

06:46.774 --> 06:49.142
and then put them together,
and forge weld.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.178
- If he took those rounds
and welded them

06:51.211 --> 06:54.047
in a billet bundle,
and went over to

06:54.081 --> 06:56.750
one of the presses, and just
pushed that bundle together.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.619
That'll be much easier.

06:58.652 --> 06:59.920
- I don't know if David
can do that,

06:59.953 --> 07:02.189
but I know
I can do it.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.925
- After I gave two or three
welding heats,

07:04.958 --> 07:07.795
and consolidated the billet,
I knew it was solid.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.129
Yeah, I got this.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.799
*

07:11.832 --> 07:15.035
- Over here, it looks like
Carl's trying to forge weld.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.638
- Uh, well, no forge welding
is actually happening.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.908
- It's a thick W2 steel.
I had two pieces,

07:20.941 --> 07:23.711
so I'm going to
heat 'em up separately,

07:23.744 --> 07:25.012
draw 'em out, make 'em
flatter and thinner,

07:25.045 --> 07:27.948
and forge weld them
together.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.718
- Carl just stuck his face
right in the fire.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.486
- Maybe his fire--

07:32.520 --> 07:34.755
- This'll be my first
forge weld ever.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.724
Forge welding is
a new adventure for me.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.659
I have no clue
what I'm doing.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.794
So, I'm gonna work on it
my best,

07:40.828 --> 07:42.930
and see if I can get
this weld to stick.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.633
*

07:45.666 --> 07:47.735
[bleep].
- Oh, burned himself.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.737
[bleep]. That hurts.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.640
- Look at that hand.
- I'm actually not surprised.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.175
He's got his hands
all the way in the forge,

07:55.208 --> 07:57.044
you saw him with
his face in the forge.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.846
- It's startin' to blister.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.950
- Yeah. It's hard to bend
my hand now, to get a grip.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.819
- If it's the palm of his hand,
that's gonna be a huge issue,

08:05.853 --> 08:08.021
'cause that's the hand
you gotta hold stuff in.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.157
- I mean, I can't imagine how
he can continue on

08:10.190 --> 08:13.126
with that burning feeling in
your hand. It's swelling,

08:13.160 --> 08:14.227
you got a blister
on there.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.166
- Yeah, no.
I'll keep going.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.101
You can't stop.
This is a competition.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.671
You're on a time limit.
Pick up where you left off.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.540
- You have just two hours
remaining to finish your work!

08:26.574 --> 08:28.576
*

08:28.609 --> 08:30.210
- Now that I've got
the cables welded,

08:30.243 --> 08:32.112
I'm gonna take it
to the power hammer

08:32.145 --> 08:34.582
and really try
to refine those welds,

08:34.615 --> 08:36.316
get the corners all pounded in,

08:36.349 --> 08:38.819
and then I'll have a bar
that I can use to forge.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.822
- Jordan's blade actually
looks great.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.024
- One thing that most people
don't know from just looking

08:44.057 --> 08:46.860
at me is that I'm
very musically inclined.

08:46.894 --> 08:50.063
I wrote a song, recently,
that pertains to blacksmithing.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.799
[fiddle tune]

08:51.832 --> 08:53.801
* Oh, I'm a mighty smith
by trade *

08:53.834 --> 08:56.003
* From chain and hook
to axe and blade *

08:56.036 --> 08:58.872
* I forge it all with my trusty
sledge, and sweat all day so *

08:58.906 --> 09:01.909
* I can pledge my work
won't be delayed *

09:01.942 --> 09:04.578
*

09:04.612 --> 09:07.214
- I don't like that bulge.
I guess I can grind that off.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.583
I'm feeling like
I'm seeing good progress,

09:09.617 --> 09:12.620
but I am still
completely wore out.

09:12.653 --> 09:15.322
I'm gonna go over to the vise
and cut my clip

09:15.355 --> 09:18.225
with the angle grinder.
I could actually forge it out,

09:18.258 --> 09:19.893
but that would be
another hour's worth of work,

09:19.927 --> 09:22.963
and I don't have that much time.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.732
- Hey, can you guys just watch

09:24.765 --> 09:27.200
what's happening over here,
with Rick?

09:27.234 --> 09:30.070
- Looks like Rick is
basically gonna grind

09:30.103 --> 09:33.040
his blade into shape.
- I don't recommend doing that.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.677
It is not what
an experienced smith does.

09:36.710 --> 09:43.751
I don't even wanna watch this.
I can't watch it.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.754
- Right now, I kinda got
the forge weld to stick,

09:46.787 --> 09:49.356
but it's a little rough.
I'm a little nervous.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.792
I'm hopin' that some of my welds
that didn't take

09:51.825 --> 09:54.094
are only on the surface.

09:54.127 --> 09:58.966
- Whoo! Yeah, he's really red.
- Yeah, he's overheating.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.969
- Somebody keep an eye on Carl.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.204
- I'm a Florida boy
and I thought this heat

10:04.237 --> 10:08.642
wouldn't be anything for me,
but... holy [bleep].

10:11.178 --> 10:13.747
- I'm starting to feel, like,
real light-headed, and

10:13.781 --> 10:15.215
losing all my strength.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.349
- Yeah, just for a minute, yeah.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.719
- He's overheating a little bit.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.688
At least he had the
wherewithal to say, "Hey,

10:20.721 --> 10:22.756
I need to step outside."
He's catching some air.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.827
- It's a frustrating moment.
I had to sit out with a medic.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.129
I've gotta get
my [bleep] together.

10:29.162 --> 10:36.904
*

10:36.937 --> 10:39.807
- Round one: Carl is
takin' some licks!

10:41.041 --> 10:43.176
- Feelin' better.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.913
- Yeah, let's do it.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.247
Behind ya!

10:47.280 --> 10:49.717
- Here we go!
- All right!

10:49.750 --> 10:51.885
[applause]

10:51.919 --> 10:53.687
- I'm not a quitter.
I'm gonna finish this thing.

10:53.721 --> 10:57.825
Hell or high water.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.427
- Two hours into the challenge,
I'm feelin' great.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.130
My blade, it looks
pretty good so far.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.298
I got no cracks--yet.

11:05.332 --> 11:09.903
So now I go to heat-treat
my blade. I'm a bit nervous.

11:09.937 --> 11:12.205
*

11:12.239 --> 11:14.942
If the small cylinders
didn't weld together,

11:14.975 --> 11:18.278
I'm going home,
and...

11:18.311 --> 11:21.214
waiting to hear the bad signs...

11:21.248 --> 11:23.350
but nothing.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.719
I was trying not to jump up and
down, because... [laughs]

11:25.753 --> 11:28.889
*

11:28.922 --> 11:32.259
- Right now, my muscles
are cramping up.

11:32.292 --> 11:35.763
I'm just hoping that
I can get this done--physically.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.230
Originally planned on doing
a hand guard--

11:37.264 --> 11:39.099
to hell with that.
I'm not doin' that.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.168
I wanna quench only
the edge of the blade,

11:41.201 --> 11:43.203
so that it'll get a harder edge.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.372
This is it. Here we go.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.808
and the spine will
stay flexible,

11:47.841 --> 11:49.309
so it has good
shock absorption.

11:49.342 --> 11:53.446
*

11:53.480 --> 11:57.384
- Oh, there he goes!
So, Jordan just quenched.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.319
- Ah!
- Whoa!

11:59.352 --> 12:01.421
- Ow, that's not good.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.356
- Dropping a red-hot piece
of steel in the water

12:03.390 --> 12:05.492
could cause some serious
internal issues.

12:05.525 --> 12:08.896
- That's not something
you wanna do.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.831
- I dropped the entire thing
in the water,

12:10.864 --> 12:13.233
so there's a possibility
that there are cracks in there

12:13.266 --> 12:16.403
because of that quench,
so I'm gonna do a second quench.

12:16.436 --> 12:20.140
*

12:20.173 --> 12:23.210
- With ten minutes left,
I'm a total mess.

12:23.243 --> 12:27.147
I'm still a little weak,
and I'm having trouble standing,

12:27.180 --> 12:29.249
but I wanna get
this quench done.

12:29.282 --> 12:32.052
*

12:32.085 --> 12:34.221
After I pull it out
of my quench,

12:34.254 --> 12:36.223
I'm still feeling like crap.

12:36.256 --> 12:40.127
*

12:40.160 --> 12:42.362
- Yeah, I'm starting to feel
worse than I did earlier.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.865
My head's spinnin',
and I'm doin' all I can

12:44.898 --> 12:46.199
just to function.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.902
- Yeah, just for a minute.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.503
- Can you be back
in two? Two!

12:50.537 --> 12:52.305
- Yes.
- Thank you.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.008
- You timin' that? Whoo.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.844
I wanna be back in time.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.812
I wanna finish
this thing through.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.580
I just knew if I went any
further, you know,

13:00.613 --> 13:02.582
on my blade,
I'd hurt myself.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.551
My family drives me.
I don't wanna disappoint 'em.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.120
I'm not a quitter.
I'm gonna finish this thing,

13:07.154 --> 13:10.157
and I wanna instill in my kids:
don't ever give up.

13:10.190 --> 13:14.127
- Yep.
Let's do it.

13:14.161 --> 13:19.266
judges: [chanting]
Carl, Carl, Carl, Carl!

13:19.299 --> 13:21.301
- Carl's been dealing with
a major burn for

13:21.334 --> 13:23.203
the majority of this
competition.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.606
It's gotta be painful,
and he still never gave up.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.042
- He's the toughest son
of a [bleep] I've ever met.

13:29.076 --> 13:33.180
- My blade is rough,
but there's nothing I can do.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.182
- Ten, nine,

13:35.215 --> 13:37.017
eight, seven,

13:37.050 --> 13:39.219
six, five,

13:39.252 --> 13:41.321
four, three,

13:41.354 --> 13:43.390
two, one...

13:43.423 --> 13:46.326
bladesmiths, shut down
your machines, drop your tools,

13:46.359 --> 13:48.028
secure your blades,
and head back to your anvils.

13:48.061 --> 13:52.165
Your forging
time is over.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.634
- I'm not real happy with
my blade, but I do have a blade.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.636
But...quite ugly.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.471
- I'm lookin' at my blade,

13:58.505 --> 14:00.340
and it's rough,
but I'm hoping the judges

14:00.373 --> 14:02.509
focus on, you know,
eing the potential

14:02.542 --> 14:05.345
of my blade,
and how badass it might be.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.547
- Bladesmiths, over the course
of the last three hours,

14:07.580 --> 14:10.650
each of you has taken
an odd-shaped piece of steel

14:10.683 --> 14:13.286
and turned it into
a signature blade

14:13.320 --> 14:16.056
in your signature style.
Now it's time for the judges

14:16.089 --> 14:18.926
to take a closer look
at your work. Rick,

14:18.959 --> 14:22.062
you're up first. Please present
your work to the judges.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.097
*

14:24.131 --> 14:26.099
- Rick, you were havin'
a battle out there

14:26.133 --> 14:27.400
with that spring,
weren't you?

14:27.434 --> 14:28.635
- To say the least. I mean,

14:28.668 --> 14:30.537
it took everything out of me.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.106
- I was noticin' that you
just chopped this off

14:33.140 --> 14:35.242
to make your point,
instead of forging it,

14:35.275 --> 14:37.444
but I commend you
for sticking through it,

14:37.477 --> 14:41.448
getting something turned in,
and having a knife.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.516
- Jordan, you're up.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.153
*

14:46.186 --> 14:49.289
- Jordan, overall,
it was really good to watch

14:49.322 --> 14:51.324
the way you work.
And you turned out

14:51.358 --> 14:53.360
a very good-looking blade.
But you accidentally

14:53.393 --> 14:56.196
dropped it on water.
So, it remains to be seen

14:56.229 --> 14:57.931
what the structure
of this blade is.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.666
But you didn't give up.
Good job.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.434
- David, you're next.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.503
Please present your work
to the judges.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.239
*

15:06.273 --> 15:08.175
- Well, when I was
watching you forge,

15:08.208 --> 15:12.045
I was impressed by you
taking that big bundle of steel

15:12.079 --> 15:14.081
and getting it all
to stick together.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.183
You have really clean
welds here,

15:16.216 --> 15:18.986
and your grind is nice.
The only part

15:19.019 --> 15:21.654
I don't really understand
is this little cut out,

15:21.688 --> 15:26.359
but if it's a design feature,
that's fine.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.661
But overall, you did good.
That's a big ole' knife.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.563
- Yes, it is.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.632
- Carl, you're up.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.702
*

15:35.735 --> 15:38.738
- Carl, you may be the person
who's been injured more

15:38.771 --> 15:41.674
in one forging session
than anyone else

15:41.708 --> 15:44.111
on the history of this show.
- Oh, wow.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.313
- You know, I commend you on
your effort, but I am agitated

15:46.346 --> 15:49.282
with you for taking two
perfectly good pieces of W2

15:49.316 --> 15:51.351
and turnin' it into
this scrap metal right here.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.086
- Right.
- The blade is rough,

15:53.120 --> 15:55.155
it's halfway forged.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.723
It's the least finished
of all of them.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.691
- I can see where this--

15:58.725 --> 16:00.360
where your
design idea was going.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.362
- Right.
- And I actually like it.

16:02.395 --> 16:05.265
I'm a little worried that,
you know, I can see these seams.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.766
- Right.
- But I don't think it

16:06.799 --> 16:09.236
welded up quite right.

16:09.269 --> 16:12.239
- Bladesmiths, this is
a tough competition.

16:12.272 --> 16:15.542
Unfortunately, this time,
it was an easy decision.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.444
*

16:17.477 --> 16:20.080
Carl, your blade
did not make the cut.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.749
Dave will explain.
- Carl, you fought a tough fight

16:22.782 --> 16:25.418
out there, but with
that heat getting to you,

16:25.452 --> 16:27.687
and the time you lost when
you were off the Forge floor,

16:27.720 --> 16:30.157
you didn't get that blade
finished nearly as far

16:30.190 --> 16:32.792
as our other smiths.
And the big thing is,

16:32.825 --> 16:35.495
your forge welds didn't take.
You have visible seams

16:35.528 --> 16:37.230
in your blade. That's the reason
we're letting you go.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.765
- Okay.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.634
- Carl, please
surrender your blade.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.570
- I was hopin' for
a different outcome,

16:43.603 --> 16:45.738
but that's all I could
physically do at that time.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.075
- Gimme the good hand.
- Thanks.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.643
- I enjoyed this experience
wholeheartedly.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.146
I've always instilled in
my children: never give up.

16:53.180 --> 16:56.416
You got a passion in a thing,
keep going.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.086
And I'm a champion in my family,
and that's all that matters.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.754
[sniffs]
Sorry.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.390
*

17:03.423 --> 17:04.691
- Congratulations,
bladesmiths.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.626
You've made it to
the second round.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.396
In this round, you'll be
taking your tempered blades

17:09.429 --> 17:11.498
and turning them
into fully functional weapons

17:11.531 --> 17:13.700
by attaching handles to them.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.635
You will have three hours
in this round.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.405
Use that time wisely,
'cause when the time runs out,

17:18.438 --> 17:20.640
one of you will have to
surrender his weapon

17:20.673 --> 17:22.709
and leave the Forge.

17:22.742 --> 17:26.279
Good luck, bladesmiths.
Your three hours starts now.

17:26.313 --> 17:28.281
*

17:28.315 --> 17:30.583
- A good formula is:
use as much steel

17:30.617 --> 17:33.286
inside of that handle
as you can possibly fit

17:33.320 --> 17:35.488
without compromising
the balance.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.557
So you don't want it
to be too small,

17:37.590 --> 17:38.825
you don't want it
to be too big,

17:38.858 --> 17:39.759
you want it to
be just right.

17:39.792 --> 17:44.431
*

17:44.464 --> 17:47.100
- Wow.
- What's Jordan doin'?

17:47.134 --> 17:49.202
- I'm heating the back
with a torch

17:49.236 --> 17:52.372
so that it softens it a bit,
so that it won't break

17:52.405 --> 17:54.807
when it chops through
the terra-cotta.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.310
I keep the edge of
the blade in the water tub,

17:57.344 --> 18:00.247
so that that doesn't overheat.

18:00.280 --> 18:04.184
Oops. Gosh. I seem
to like diving into this bucket.

18:04.217 --> 18:08.721
- Jordan has dropped his
entire blade, once again,

18:08.755 --> 18:10.457
into the water barrel.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.791
- Sure, yeah.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.626
- What does that do to
his temper?

18:13.660 --> 18:15.528
- When Jordan dropped that
in the water,

18:15.562 --> 18:18.498
it was not glowing red,
so it shouldn't have been

18:18.531 --> 18:20.333
hot enough to really
affect it that much.

18:20.367 --> 18:24.771
*

18:24.804 --> 18:27.840
- I feel great
going into round two.

18:27.874 --> 18:31.144
Decisions, decisions.
What about this?

18:31.178 --> 18:32.845
It wouldn't be too bad.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.715
I went with a carbon-fiber
looking Micarta

18:35.748 --> 18:39.152
because it was
the first thing I found.

18:39.186 --> 18:41.454
I am gonna make
a two-piece handle--

18:41.488 --> 18:44.557
coffin-style handle--
and it's just two scales

18:44.591 --> 18:47.494
on a full-tang knife.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.762
I have plans of putting
yellow liners in,

18:49.796 --> 18:52.532
to offset
the dark handle scales.

18:52.565 --> 18:55.302
You gotta have
that one thing that

18:55.335 --> 18:57.237
just catches
somebody's eye.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.806
- You know, David's been
a cool customer.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.209
He hasn't let
anything fluster him.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.744
- As of right now, I don't
have any concerns.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.813
I'm sure that will
change soon.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.249
- Who's got the most
work to do, Jason?

19:09.282 --> 19:11.951
- The most work to do
will be Rick.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.587
- First thing, the priority
is to get a hole in this.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.390
I gotta make sure that
I can drill the rivet holes

19:17.424 --> 19:19.792
for the handle.
So, I'm hopin' that it'll be

19:19.826 --> 19:21.328
boom, boom, boom,
I get the holes in,

19:21.361 --> 19:22.662
I'm done with that.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.397
[machine clanks]
- Oh! Turn off.

19:24.431 --> 19:25.898
Stop, stop, stop.
Lost my drill bit.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.500
Got stuck in the thing.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.302
This is not good.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.205
And I gotta
tighten this down good.

19:32.239 --> 19:35.675
When it gets stuck like that,
it'll go shoop! And hit ya.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.610
It should go through
pretty easily now,

19:37.644 --> 19:40.313
but we'll see.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.350
- Rick is not making progress.
- Good way to get burned.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.751
- He really should've
drilled those holes

19:44.784 --> 19:46.519
before he hardened that blade.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.321
That would've been
the smart thing to do.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.923
- I don't have a lot of
time to fix my mistakes

19:50.957 --> 19:52.859
on the blade from
the first round,

19:52.892 --> 19:54.961
and this drill press
is taking me some extra time.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.863
- Can you tell me if
he's even using that

19:56.896 --> 19:59.566
piece of machinery correctly?
- No, he's not.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.969
[dramatic music]

20:03.002 --> 20:06.239
- [bleep]!
It got stuck again! Damn.

20:06.273 --> 20:06.939
- What the hell
is he doing?

20:10.910 --> 20:13.012
- I'm really improvising
here now.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.248
My blade wasn't even close
to Dave or Jordan's.

20:15.282 --> 20:17.650
I don't have a lot of time
to fix my mistakes

20:17.684 --> 20:18.918
on the blade from
the first round.

20:18.951 --> 20:19.919
[machine clanks]

20:19.952 --> 20:21.421
Oh, no. [bleep].

20:21.454 --> 20:24.591
*

20:24.624 --> 20:27.560
All right, we're through.
- There we go.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.662
- All right, now we gotta
get to the grinder.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.598
- Oh, gosh.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.533
I'm spending a lot of time
in the pantry

20:33.566 --> 20:35.335
because I really wanna
make sure that I make

20:35.368 --> 20:37.537
the right decision
for materials. I'm looking

20:37.570 --> 20:39.639
for something that's
really strong,

20:39.672 --> 20:42.709
so I finally settle
on black palm handle scales

20:42.742 --> 20:44.777
and carbon fiber.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.046
So, when I drill
my first handle scale,

20:47.079 --> 20:49.649
I realize that it didn't
really line up perfectly.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.017
It's a little bit frustrating

20:51.050 --> 20:53.353
because I know that
time is ticking.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.422
*

20:55.455 --> 20:57.557
- I've come to
the conclusion that

20:57.590 --> 21:00.660
I can't use the yellow liners,
due to the fact that

21:00.693 --> 21:03.896
the handle on my knife
is so thick.

21:03.930 --> 21:07.534
It's a big deal to me
because it was part of the plan,

21:07.567 --> 21:10.670
and now the plan has changed.
I'm afraid the judges

21:10.703 --> 21:12.772
are gonna say that
I didn't do enough

21:12.805 --> 21:15.642
in the time allotted,
'cause my handle's so plain.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.977
*

21:18.010 --> 21:20.880
- That's not too bad, really.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.082
I want the handle to be
really secure to the tang,

21:23.115 --> 21:26.553
so with the Corby rivets,
I'm also using epoxy.

21:26.586 --> 21:29.722
If it's not hardened enough
when I start grinding,

21:29.756 --> 21:32.425
it'll actually start
melting the epoxy.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.994
So I'm thinking all of this
while it's sitting in the vise,

21:35.027 --> 21:36.363
and staring at the clock.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.897
Dry fast!

21:37.930 --> 21:39.799
*

21:39.832 --> 21:41.601
Heck with it, I'm just
gonna take it out now

21:41.634 --> 21:43.636
and I'm gonna go
over to the grinder

21:43.670 --> 21:46.406
and start grinding
and hope the epoxy doesn't melt.

21:46.439 --> 21:49.376
Oh, God. All right,
I'm not used to this at all.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.110
I wish I had another
hour or two,

21:51.143 --> 21:54.046
so I can do this blade
so much better, but I don't.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.983
- Bladesmiths, less than
ten minutes remains

21:57.016 --> 21:59.586
on that clock!

21:59.619 --> 22:01.354
- I wish there were
just ten more minutes,

22:01.388 --> 22:04.123
because I could really
do my best work with just

22:04.156 --> 22:07.026
a little bit more time.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.095
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
go and I'm gonna

22:09.128 --> 22:11.030
put the edge on my blade,
because that's

22:11.063 --> 22:13.466
a much more important part
of the competition.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.135
Because if it doesn't cut,
then it's not a knife.

22:16.168 --> 22:20.139
But it's not gonna look
as good as I'd like it to.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.741
- Ten, nine,

22:21.774 --> 22:23.109
eight, seven,

22:23.142 --> 22:25.077
six, five,

22:25.111 --> 22:26.613
four,

22:26.646 --> 22:28.415
three, two,

22:28.448 --> 22:30.483
one...

22:30.517 --> 22:32.051
bladesmiths, drop your tools,
secure your blades.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.720
Head back
to your anvils.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.988
*

22:36.022 --> 22:38.024
- I so much wanted to do
so much more with the blade,

22:38.057 --> 22:40.527
but... it is
what it is,

22:40.560 --> 22:42.895
and I hope it
performs well.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.998
- Bladesmiths, this is the
strength and durability test.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.535
I'll be taking your blades
and hammering them

22:48.568 --> 22:51.571
into these terra-cotta tiles.
Remember, it's not about

22:51.604 --> 22:54.441
what your blade does
to these tiles; it's about

22:54.474 --> 22:56.909
what these terra-cotta tiles
do to your blades.

22:56.943 --> 22:59.011
David, you ready?
- Absolutely.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.681
*

23:01.714 --> 23:03.983
When I saw that Jason
was gonna use the hammer

23:04.016 --> 23:05.852
to drive the blade through
the terra-cotta,

23:05.885 --> 23:08.955
I was like, "Oh, [bleep]."
I wasn't planning on

23:08.988 --> 23:11.758
blunt-force trauma
to the back of my blade.

23:11.791 --> 23:17.897
*

23:17.930 --> 23:20.900
[tiles shatter]

23:20.933 --> 23:23.570
[exhales]

23:23.603 --> 23:28.975
- Well, David.
No damage, no cracks.

23:29.008 --> 23:32.144
One of the things that
I don't like about your knife

23:32.178 --> 23:35.014
is you left the back
square right here.

23:35.047 --> 23:37.784
I would've liked to have
seen you round this back off

23:37.817 --> 23:41.153
a lot more,
but overall, not bad.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.923
- Jordan, are you ready?
- Go for it.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.124
- All right.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.059
*

23:47.093 --> 23:48.995
- When I dropped the blade
in the water--

23:49.028 --> 23:50.630
that quick change
in temperature worries me,

23:50.663 --> 23:52.699
because if there are
any cracks,

23:52.732 --> 23:55.635
the blade could fail
catastrophically.

23:55.668 --> 23:59.138
*

23:59.171 --> 24:01.574
Oh, gosh. Please don't break.

24:08.247 --> 24:11.150
[tile shatters]

24:12.552 --> 24:15.021
- I was a little concerned
about this edge,

24:15.054 --> 24:18.791
but virtually
no damage.

24:18.825 --> 24:19.959
Just this little ding
from the hammer,

24:19.992 --> 24:22.128
but that's to be expected.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.964
- Rick, are you ready?
- As ready as I'll ever be.

24:24.997 --> 24:31.904
*

24:34.741 --> 24:37.644
[tile shatters]

24:39.746 --> 24:42.214
- It is a really thick edge,
so it was actually--

24:42.248 --> 24:44.050
it was well designed
for cutting through

24:44.083 --> 24:47.186
the terra-cotta tile.
But it may have some

24:47.219 --> 24:51.524
edge damage. Wherever we laid it
on the tile and hammered it,

24:51.558 --> 24:54.060
that's where your edge
is not sharp anymore.

24:54.093 --> 24:57.830
- I really didn't get as nice
an edge on the blade

24:57.864 --> 25:00.767
as I wanted to.
With the mat slice,

25:00.800 --> 25:05.605
I'm really thinking my blade's
not gonna do good at all.

25:05.638 --> 25:08.541
- Bladesmiths, to see how sharp
your blades are,

25:08.575 --> 25:10.777
I will take your weapon
and I will deliver a slash

25:10.810 --> 25:12.979
across these tatami mats.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.246
Dave, you're up first.
Are you ready?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.783
- Absolutely.
- Let's do this.

25:16.816 --> 25:23.790
*

25:23.823 --> 25:26.726
[chains rattling]

25:29.796 --> 25:31.798
- I like the overall
shape of your blade.

25:31.831 --> 25:35.968
It's got a wide taper
that goes into the edge

25:36.002 --> 25:39.238
of your blade, so when you cut,
it definitely lacerated through

25:39.271 --> 25:42.274
and cut through the first part
of the tatami mat.

25:42.308 --> 25:45.311
Overall, your blade
will cut.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.279
Jordan, you're up.
Are you ready?

25:47.313 --> 25:49.115
- Go for it.
- Let's do that.

25:49.148 --> 25:56.088
*

25:56.122 --> 25:59.158
[chains rattling]

25:59.191 --> 26:03.696
*

26:03.730 --> 26:06.699
Well, Jordan, your blade
is one of the lightest

26:06.733 --> 26:09.135
and skinniest,
but it goes to show

26:09.168 --> 26:11.303
that you don't need
a heavy blade to be able

26:11.337 --> 26:14.306
to cut through.
And it's plenty sharp.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.676
Your blade will cut.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.310
Good job.
- Thank you.

26:18.344 --> 26:19.378
- Rick, you're up next.
You ready?

26:19.411 --> 26:21.213
- Uh... I guess I have to.

26:21.247 --> 26:28.054
*

26:28.087 --> 26:30.957
[intense drum music]

26:31.390 --> 26:33.960
*

26:33.993 --> 26:36.629
- Your handle--it's a little bit
on the blocky side,

26:36.663 --> 26:38.898
but it is enough
to grab hold onto.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.267
Your edge--the profile
you have is thick,

26:41.300 --> 26:42.935
so once it cuts through,
it hung up in there,

26:42.969 --> 26:44.971
'cause these are
very tightly wound.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.707
But, what we are looking
for is an edge

26:47.740 --> 26:51.778
that will lacerate,
and your weapon will cut.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.346
- Thanks, Doug.
- Good job.

26:54.380 --> 26:57.650
- Well, bladesmiths,
the weapons tests are complete,

26:57.684 --> 26:59.786
and the judges have
a final decision to make.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.253
While they do that,
I'm gonna have you please

27:01.287 --> 27:03.990
step off the Forge floor.

27:04.023 --> 27:07.827
*

27:07.860 --> 27:10.096
- I still wish I had
ten minutes more.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.964
- I think we all would've wished
for ten minutes more.

27:11.998 --> 27:14.033
- I wish they had about
another hour.

27:14.066 --> 27:17.136
- So, let's get into the details
of these blades, okay?

27:17.169 --> 27:18.938
Is there a blade here

27:18.971 --> 27:20.873
that performed better
than the others?

27:20.907 --> 27:23.409
- Jordan's work started off
by showing us

27:23.442 --> 27:26.012
what patience will do,
and patience did pay off.

27:26.045 --> 27:29.248
It sliced without any resistance
when it went through

27:29.281 --> 27:33.019
the tatami mat.
- So, Jordan is gonna go ahead

27:33.052 --> 27:34.854
and move forward
in this competition.

27:34.887 --> 27:38.758
Okay, let's move on
to David's blade.

27:38.791 --> 27:40.927
- Oh, boy.
- I would have liked

27:40.960 --> 27:42.995
to have seen him bring
that grind up a little,

27:43.029 --> 27:45.932
and it may have cut
all the way through the tatami.

27:45.965 --> 27:49.001
The number two thing about
David's blade is his handle.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.870
It's just
a little square.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.038
- Always gotta knock
the edge off.

27:52.071 --> 27:54.006
- Yeah.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.308
- All right. Let's move on
to our last bladesmith, Rick.

27:56.342 --> 28:00.012
- Oh, they're lookin' at mine.
My beast.

28:00.046 --> 28:03.349
- Its performance: it lacerates.
But the issue:

28:03.382 --> 28:05.818
you can really see how
it wasn't forged in there,

28:05.852 --> 28:07.419
especially by the way
he just cut it out

28:07.453 --> 28:10.322
instead of forging
the shape of the blade.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.891
- All right, gents,
I need to know.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.125
Doug, have you made
your final decision?

28:13.159 --> 28:14.861
- Yes, I have.
- Dave?

28:14.894 --> 28:15.962
- Yup.
- Jason?

28:15.995 --> 28:17.063
- Yeah, man.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.064
- Let's go tell our smiths.

28:18.097 --> 28:21.000
*

28:21.033 --> 28:23.736
- Bladesmiths, the judges
have made their final decision.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.271
It's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.439
*

28:27.473 --> 28:32.278
Rick, your blade did not make
the cut. Dave will explain.

28:32.311 --> 28:35.114
- Rick, you came through.
You turned in a blade

28:35.147 --> 28:38.284
that was tested.
In the end, it came down to

28:38.317 --> 28:40.119
the edge geometry
of your blade

28:40.152 --> 28:42.121
and the fact that your blade
is the least finished

28:42.154 --> 28:43.923
of all three of our blades.
That's the reason

28:43.956 --> 28:45.925
we're letting you go.
- Rick, please surrender

28:45.958 --> 28:48.327
your blade.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.296
- I knew that it was gonna
be difficult,

28:50.329 --> 28:52.331
but I have never been
this emotional

28:52.364 --> 28:55.868
in my entire life. Just--
I'm passionate about it.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.137
Thank you.

28:58.170 --> 29:01.007
From this experience I've had
a tremendous adventure.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.042
I think I've made
some new friends,

29:03.075 --> 29:05.144
but I'm ready to go home.
I'm ready to go

29:05.177 --> 29:07.446
back to my family.

29:07.479 --> 29:09.949
- David, Jordan.
Congratulations.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.117
You've made it into
the third round

29:11.150 --> 29:13.052
of this competition. Good job.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.520
And if you thought the last
six hours was tough,

29:14.553 --> 29:16.923
it's nothing compared to
the next five days.

29:16.956 --> 29:19.391
Because we're sending you back
to your home forges to recreate

29:19.425 --> 29:21.961
an iconic weapon from history.
And that weapon is...

29:21.994 --> 29:25.231
*

29:25.264 --> 29:28.300
The talwar.

29:28.334 --> 29:31.137
The talwar was a lethal
and fearsome combat weapon

29:31.170 --> 29:34.473
originating in the 1300s.
Instrumental to the militia

29:34.506 --> 29:37.376
of the Mughal empire,
its curved blade was optimal

29:37.409 --> 29:39.879
in delivering repeated blows
to human flesh

29:39.912 --> 29:42.148
without the danger
of getting stuck in bone.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.350
The weapon also
included a sharp spike

29:44.383 --> 29:46.385
attached to the pommel
that could be used

29:46.418 --> 29:48.487
to strike down opponents
in close-quarters combat.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.991
When off the battlefield,
the talwar was a sacred sword

29:52.024 --> 29:53.993
worn by Sikhs as
an article of faith

29:54.026 --> 29:56.062
that symbolized their duty
to defend the rights

29:56.095 --> 29:58.397
of those who were
unjustly oppressed.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.900
Your final challenge is
to forge a talwar.

30:00.933 --> 30:03.369
It must be an effective,
working version of that weapon.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.004
The overall length
of your weapon

30:05.037 --> 30:07.439
must fall between
35 and 37 inches.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.176
The handle must be made
entirely out of metal,

30:10.209 --> 30:13.846
include a knuckle bow,
and a flat, sc pommel.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.415
- I can comfortably make a blade
like this in a week,

30:16.448 --> 30:19.518
and I can uncomfortably
make one in five days.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.387
- After five days,
you will return

30:21.420 --> 30:23.322
and present your finished
talwars to our panel

30:23.355 --> 30:25.524
of expert judges.
Only after they've put them

30:25.557 --> 30:28.394
through a series of brutal tests
will they declare one of you

30:28.427 --> 30:31.363
the "Forged in Fire" champion,
who also walks away with

30:31.397 --> 30:34.166
that check for 10 grand.
Good luck, bladesmiths.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.467
We'll see you
in five days.

30:35.501 --> 30:39.972
*

30:40.006 --> 30:42.274
- My shop's a barn.
I share the space

30:42.308 --> 30:44.376
with our horse, Cricket.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.278
And in my forging area,
there's no electricity,

30:46.312 --> 30:49.115
so all of my forging
is done by hand.

30:49.148 --> 30:51.017
I'm a little nervous.
I've never made anything

30:51.050 --> 30:52.584
with such a big curve before.

30:52.618 --> 30:55.187
*

30:55.221 --> 30:57.389
So I'm working on
the bevels right now.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.058
The curve is starting
to happen,

30:59.091 --> 31:00.659
so I like to see
that. The problem is,

31:00.692 --> 31:05.965
the more curve I put in it,
the shorter it gets.

31:05.998 --> 31:08.200
Ah, it's an inch too short.

31:08.234 --> 31:11.203
If I'm a quarter of an inch off,
they're not gonna test my blade.

31:11.237 --> 31:14.140
It's a delicate balance between
having just enough curve

31:14.173 --> 31:17.576
and just enough length.
It's a little nerve-racking.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.912
Be nice not to have work
with these extremes.

31:19.946 --> 31:22.614
*

31:22.648 --> 31:26.352
- It's day one here at my home
forge in Kalkaska, Michigan.

31:26.385 --> 31:30.256
Hopefully today I can get
my blade rough-forged.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.624
That's the plan, anyway.

31:32.658 --> 31:35.694
*

31:35.727 --> 31:38.130
I've never done a sword of

31:38.164 --> 31:41.133
this magnitude and difficulty,
so we'll see that turns out.

31:41.167 --> 31:43.035
[machines whirring]

31:43.069 --> 31:44.570
I just gotta make it perfect,

31:44.603 --> 31:47.606
because my competitor
is really good.

31:47.639 --> 31:50.409
*

31:50.442 --> 31:53.479
So day one, I'd like to be
a little further,

31:53.512 --> 31:55.547
of course, but all in all,
it's been a good day.

31:55.581 --> 31:58.250
*

31:58.284 --> 32:01.353
- It's day two.
I'm trying to get

32:01.387 --> 32:03.622
this blade a little longer
to fit the parameters.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.257
I'm gettin' a little worried.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.093
This fuller's buckled
right here.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.627
When the fuller starts
to buckle, it means that

32:08.660 --> 32:11.563
the wall on either side
is really thin

32:11.597 --> 32:13.399
and it's starting
to move around,

32:13.432 --> 32:15.201
and there's a danger
of grinding through

32:15.234 --> 32:18.437
when you go to the grinder.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.272
And this fuller is
not really behaving the way

32:20.306 --> 32:24.010
I want it to.
I'd rather not risk it,

32:24.043 --> 32:26.612
and I'm gonna start over.
I've wasted a whole day.

32:26.645 --> 32:31.483
This is a nightmare.

32:31.517 --> 32:34.720
- I said that I wasn't gonna
make the fuller too thin,

32:34.753 --> 32:37.456
and that's exactly what I did.
It's a little frustrating

32:37.489 --> 32:39.558
to have lost that time.

32:39.591 --> 32:42.328
So, I'm gonna start
this blade over.

32:42.361 --> 32:47.533
*

32:47.566 --> 32:50.736
Back to working on the fuller.

32:50.769 --> 32:54.540
I'm a little behind
where I hoped I'd be,

32:54.573 --> 32:58.644
and I'm exhausted.

32:58.677 --> 33:01.180
Finally! I'm gonna
call that good.

33:01.213 --> 33:03.482
*

33:03.515 --> 33:08.554
- So it's day three,
and today I'm going

33:08.587 --> 33:09.755
to finish my handle.

33:09.788 --> 33:15.727
*

33:15.761 --> 33:18.797
I think I'm gonna get ready
to drill this for the handle.

33:18.830 --> 33:23.335
The most pressure I feel is
getting the handle drilled.

33:23.369 --> 33:27.206
Solid metal handle, gosh.

33:27.239 --> 33:31.210
Sucks... Son of a gun.

33:31.243 --> 33:34.113
Nope. It got hard
on me.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.781
The Damascus that I made
is too hard.

33:35.814 --> 33:38.784
I got partially through
and found a hard spot.

33:38.817 --> 33:42.721
I wasted a lot of time,
but I gotta cut my losses

33:42.754 --> 33:44.556
and go to plan B.

33:44.590 --> 33:47.093
I have no idea
what plan B is yet.

33:47.126 --> 33:50.396
*

33:50.429 --> 33:53.099
- All right, day 4.
The blade's done,

33:53.132 --> 33:55.134
now it's time
for the handle.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.436
I've never made an
entirely metal handle,

33:57.469 --> 33:59.371
and a handle is
a tricky piece of forge work,

33:59.405 --> 34:01.140
so I'm
a little nervous.

34:01.173 --> 34:04.176
This is, uh...
as hard as I expected.

34:04.210 --> 34:07.113
[groaning]

34:07.146 --> 34:08.847
It's cracking like crazy.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.582
I'm seein' all these cracks
in my handle,

34:10.616 --> 34:12.551
and I don't have
any way to fix them.

34:12.584 --> 34:14.520
And I'm starting over.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.722
Restarting the handle
puts me about five hours behind.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.690
It's gonna be crunch time.

34:18.724 --> 34:21.160
I'm ready to be done
with this handle.

34:21.193 --> 34:23.229
I was determined
not to screw it up,

34:23.262 --> 34:24.430
and here I am,
screwing it up again.

34:24.463 --> 34:27.299
*

34:27.333 --> 34:30.236
- Day five.
I had this crazy idea

34:30.269 --> 34:33.239
of doing a damascus handle,
but the damascus that I made

34:33.272 --> 34:36.508
was too hard. So,
we're going with plan B,

34:36.542 --> 34:39.145
which is
the hollow-form pipe.

34:39.178 --> 34:40.579
Don't know why
I didn't think of this sooner.

34:40.612 --> 34:43.249
*

34:43.282 --> 34:46.585
The advantage of this was...
no drilling.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.620
It's pretty much
ready to go.

34:48.654 --> 34:51.723
And so now we're actually
gonna get the blade polished,

34:51.757 --> 34:54.860
get the handle welded up,
get it epoxied to the blade.

34:54.893 --> 34:57.363
Feeling relieved.

34:57.396 --> 35:01.533
And then... Chop some stuff.

35:01.567 --> 35:02.568
There we go!

35:02.601 --> 35:06.238
*

35:06.272 --> 35:09.341
That makes me happy. Nice.

35:09.375 --> 35:11.743
*

35:11.777 --> 35:13.879
- Bladesmiths, welcome back.
You had five days

35:13.912 --> 35:15.714
at your home forge
to work on your talwars.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.516
David, why don't you tell
the judges

35:17.549 --> 35:19.585
a little bit about yours.
- It went really well.

35:19.618 --> 35:23.189
I forged it out of 1084,
plain high-carbon steel.

35:23.222 --> 35:26.158
I forged the handle from
a piece of pipe.

35:26.192 --> 35:28.660
- Did you have fun?
- Oh, absolutely.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.729
- Jordan, why don't you
tell us about your weapon.

35:30.762 --> 35:35.201
- I also used 1084 for my blade,
and I forged the whole handle

35:35.234 --> 35:38.370
out of solid mild steel,
and glued it to give it

35:38.404 --> 35:41.173
a nice patina,
and added some brass for flair.

35:41.207 --> 35:43.342
- They both look fantastic,
but we know that

35:43.375 --> 35:45.544
looks are secondy
to performance.

35:45.577 --> 35:48.880
There will be a strength,
a kill, and a sharpness test.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.717
Dave?
- All right, gentleman, this is

35:51.750 --> 35:53.785
the sharpness test. Now,
the talwar was a blade

35:53.819 --> 35:56.588
respected throughout India,
so to test the sharpness

35:56.622 --> 35:58.490
of your blade, I'll be cutting
into these sugar canes.

35:58.524 --> 35:59.925
David, you're up.
Are you ready?

35:59.958 --> 36:01.260
- Absolutely.
- All right.

36:01.293 --> 36:03.362
*

36:03.395 --> 36:04.930
- I know my
weapon's sharp,

36:04.963 --> 36:07.666
but there's always that
little bit of doubt.

36:07.699 --> 36:11.370
*

36:11.403 --> 36:14.273
[talwar clanking]

36:14.306 --> 36:19.978
*

36:20.011 --> 36:22.981
- [muffled laughter]

36:23.014 --> 36:25.317
I think the sugar cane
speaks for itself.

36:25.351 --> 36:26.818
There's a lot
of weight in this,

36:26.852 --> 36:29.921
but it's not bad.
It's balanced very well.

36:29.955 --> 36:32.624
So the design
of your knuckle bow--

36:32.658 --> 36:34.793
being inside, where
this pommel is--

36:34.826 --> 36:37.296
my hand slips back there.
I'm kinda lockin' into that.

36:37.329 --> 36:40.399
But it's sharp. Nicely done.
- Thank you.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.301
- All right, Jordan.
You ready?

36:42.334 --> 36:45.871
- I'm ready.
- Okay, let's do this.

36:45.904 --> 36:48.840
[talwar clanking]

36:48.874 --> 36:55.814
*

36:57.949 --> 37:01.520
I just love sabers.

37:01.553 --> 37:05.457
This is a cutter. It's fast,
it's light. But the profile

37:05.491 --> 37:08.460
of your handle could be
a little bit larger for my hand,

37:08.494 --> 37:10.696
but all in all, the cuts
speak for themselves.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.631
It just passed through
with no resistance whatsoever.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.600
Nicely done.

37:14.633 --> 37:17.269
- Our blades--they're performing
almost identical.

37:17.303 --> 37:18.804
This is gonna be tight.

37:18.837 --> 37:21.507
- The talwar--
a battle-tested weapon.

37:21.540 --> 37:24.310
But what kind of lethal
damage does this weapon do?

37:24.343 --> 37:26.278
To find that out,
I will take your weapon

37:26.312 --> 37:29.315
and deliver killing blows
on this ballistics dummy.

37:29.348 --> 37:30.482
David, you're up first.
You ready?

37:30.516 --> 37:32.651
- Oh, yeah.
- Let's do this.

37:32.684 --> 37:35.721
- Doug and
the ballistics dummy--

37:35.754 --> 37:37.556
this is the test that
I wanted to see.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.358
I'm just, like,
super excited.

37:39.391 --> 37:45.897
*

37:45.931 --> 37:52.704
[talwar slams dummy]

37:52.738 --> 37:55.874
[blood squelches]

37:55.907 --> 37:58.944
- Your edge of your blade
is sharp enough to cut

37:58.977 --> 38:00.946
and lacerate
the whole torso here,

38:00.979 --> 38:04.483
cutting deep and cutting
into bones. Same thing

38:04.516 --> 38:06.852
with the clavicle over here,
and into the ribs.

38:06.885 --> 38:10.055
Your handle construction is a
little bit on the wider side,

38:10.088 --> 38:15.093
but it's wieldable.
Overall, your weapon will kill.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.095
Good job.
- Thank you.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.897
- Jordan, you're next.
You ready?

38:18.930 --> 38:20.932
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this.

38:20.966 --> 38:27.873
*

38:32.611 --> 38:34.546
- All right, Jordan, let's
talk about your blade.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.982
Your edge geometry here
definitely lends itself

38:37.015 --> 38:40.552
to be a very good thruster.
It sliced in easily.

38:40.586 --> 38:44.856
Your edge is razor sharp,
that I'm able to lacerate into

38:44.890 --> 38:48.460
the dummy and break some bones.
Your handle is a little bit

38:48.494 --> 38:51.463
on the skinny side,
but I'm still able to index

38:51.497 --> 38:55.434
and hold onto it.
Your weapon will kill.

38:55.467 --> 38:58.069
- After this round,
it feels like two to two.

38:58.103 --> 39:00.005
Dave and I
still feel really even.

39:00.038 --> 39:02.474
- All right, gentlemen,
this is the strength test.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.876
The talwar was
a battle-tested weapon,

39:04.910 --> 39:08.514
known to actually take heads
in combat. To test the strength

39:08.547 --> 39:10.849
and durability of your blades,
I'll be chopping four times

39:10.882 --> 39:13.385
into these beef rib sides.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.687
This is not about what your
blade does to the beef,

39:15.721 --> 39:18.156
but what these ribs
do to your blade.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.058
All right, Dave,
you're up.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.727
Ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.029
A side of beef is
extremely tough.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.632
It could potentially
break a blade, or chip a blade,

39:26.665 --> 39:29.701
or bend a blade,
so I'm concerned.

39:29.735 --> 39:36.408
*

39:36.442 --> 39:38.444
[sharp thwacking]

39:38.477 --> 39:39.478
[quietly] Wow.

39:39.511 --> 39:46.485
*

39:49.755 --> 39:51.590
- Okay, David. I've got
a little bit of chipping

39:51.623 --> 39:55.093
and rolling, right where
the impact is. It's not deep,

39:55.126 --> 39:59.197
but it is there.
All in all, it felt good.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.600
All right, Jordan.
You ready?

40:01.633 --> 40:03.602
- Guess so.

40:03.635 --> 40:06.037
I'm pretty nervous.
Getting through the bone

40:06.071 --> 40:08.006
is gonna be tricky,
and all I can think is,

40:08.039 --> 40:10.175
"Please don't chip,
please don't chip."

40:10.208 --> 40:17.148
*

40:19.084 --> 40:21.887
[bones crack]

40:21.920 --> 40:26.024
- Took a little shrapnel
off that one.

40:26.057 --> 40:29.828
I can run my fingernail
along that edge

40:29.861 --> 40:33.064
and not feel anything.
No bumps, no chips.

40:33.098 --> 40:36.635
Still straight. Everything's
still tight. Good job.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.069
- Thank you.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.606
I'm breathing a huge sigh
of relief,

40:40.639 --> 40:42.941
but I know that also,
my handle's a little small,

40:42.974 --> 40:44.910
and people have been sent home
for handles before.

40:44.943 --> 40:49.014
*

40:49.047 --> 40:52.183
- David, Jordan. Both of you
have made excellent blades,

40:52.217 --> 40:53.852
and you've been
fantastic competitors,

40:53.885 --> 40:55.721
but in this arena
of competition,

40:55.754 --> 40:57.889
there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" champion.

40:57.923 --> 40:59.825
Before I announce who that is,

40:59.858 --> 41:03.161
the judges have some feedback
for both of you.

41:03.194 --> 41:05.731
- Dave, you brought us a weapon
that was a pleasure to use.

41:05.764 --> 41:07.799
It's a heavy weapon,

41:07.833 --> 41:09.835
but you balanced
it out beautifully.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.670
Nice job.
- Thank you.

41:11.703 --> 41:14.606
- Doug?
- Jordan, the artistry

41:14.640 --> 41:16.842
of your handle
is matched by the beauty,

41:16.875 --> 41:20.546
strength, and sharpness
of your blade. Well done, sir.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.247
- Gentleman, when weapons
of this caliber

41:22.280 --> 41:25.984
come into this arena,
these decisions are never easy.

41:26.017 --> 41:27.819
The "Forged in Fire"
champion is...

41:27.853 --> 41:31.923
*

41:31.957 --> 41:33.992
Jordan. Congratulations.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.627
You are the "Forged in Fire"
champion.

41:35.661 --> 41:37.729
- Congratulations.

41:37.763 --> 41:39.798
- David, you created
a beautiful weapon,

41:39.831 --> 41:41.733
and it was a pleasure
to use it,

41:41.767 --> 41:44.870
and this decision came down
to the finest details.

41:44.903 --> 41:47.138
Basically, the positioning
of that knuckle bow

41:47.172 --> 41:49.908
on the handle,
and those chips that turned up

41:49.941 --> 41:51.810
in your blade in
the strength test.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.712
For those two reasons,
we're letting you go.

41:53.745 --> 41:57.816
- David, please surrender
your weapon.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.886
- Absolutely no regrets.

42:00.919 --> 42:02.253
I would've liked
to have done better,

42:02.287 --> 42:04.289
but I agree with
the judges' decision.

42:04.322 --> 42:06.291
I came here to prove that
I could hang with

42:06.324 --> 42:09.127
some of the best bladesmiths
in the United States,

42:09.160 --> 42:12.230
and I think I proved
that I can do that.

42:12.263 --> 42:13.932
- Jordan, congratulations.

42:13.965 --> 42:15.801
You are
the "Forged in Fire" champion,

42:15.834 --> 42:17.869
and will be receiving
that check for $10,000.

42:17.903 --> 42:20.772
How do you feel right now?
- I feel great.

42:20.806 --> 42:22.340
And I feel
pretty accomplished.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.610
- Well, you should.
- What a great way

42:24.643 --> 42:28.947
to jump-start my career making
really high quality blades.

42:28.980 --> 42:31.917
This is what I've
really wanted for a long time.

42:31.950 --> 42:34.853
It's why I came here.
I'm "Forged in Fire" champion.
