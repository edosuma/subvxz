<i>Christmas spirit--</i>

00:07.828 --> 00:10.279
<i>this year, it hit</i>
<i>the most unlikely of scrooges.</i>

00:10.361 --> 00:11.288
Mwah!

00:12.137 --> 00:13.490
Yeah, you don't
have to be this excited

00:13.575 --> 00:15.174
my parents aren't coming
for Christmas.

00:15.263 --> 00:16.507
Yes, I do.

00:16.705 --> 00:18.835
No parents means
no air mattress,

00:18.947 --> 00:20.505
no sharing the TV,

00:20.627 --> 00:22.790
no waking up to Tag reaching

00:22.870 --> 00:25.530
for a high shelf
in his sleep shirt.

00:26.053 --> 00:28.512
Matter of fact, this year,
don't get me any presents.

00:28.574 --> 00:30.272
You already got me
everything I wanted.

00:30.362 --> 00:32.219
Oh, Mike, I bought those
special for Axl.

00:32.326 --> 00:33.685
She wouldn't let me
have one either.

00:33.803 --> 00:35.624
I got a half a pop-tart
and an olive.

00:35.814 --> 00:36.693
Shh.

00:36.966 --> 00:39.607
I'm just excited
that your brother's coming home

00:39.700 --> 00:41.720
for his first Christmas
from college.

00:41.818 --> 00:44.876
Don't worry. Someday,
I'll be happy you're here, too.

00:46.252 --> 00:47.698
Ooh, where did you get
the new book light?

00:47.854 --> 00:49.400
From school--
this is the prize you get

00:49.486 --> 00:51.332
for selling 20 rolls
of wrapping paper.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.657
You sold 20 rolls
of wrapping paper?

00:53.765 --> 00:55.137
That I did not do,

00:55.282 --> 00:56.413
but I'm not worried
'cause they said

00:56.508 --> 00:58.500
I don't need to give them
any money till January.

00:58.602 --> 00:59.775
Wait a minute.

00:59.889 --> 01:01.953
The snowman wrapping paper
in my closet

01:02.047 --> 01:03.910
that I convinced myself
I bought in February

01:04.007 --> 01:06.252
'cause I wish I was more
organized than I actually am?

01:06.421 --> 01:07.890
That would be it.

01:07.995 --> 01:10.888
Brick, I wrapped
all our presents in that.

01:11.011 --> 01:12.615
Oh, that'll be $97,

01:12.746 --> 01:13.976
and if you wouldn't mind saying

01:14.065 --> 01:16.090
your sales rep
was courteous and professional.

01:16.184 --> 01:18.969
Yeah, there's no way I'm
paying $97 for wrapping paper.

01:19.052 --> 01:20.402
You're just gonna
have to unwrap it

01:20.502 --> 01:22.060
and get it all back
on the roll.

01:22.199 --> 01:24.027
But won't I see my presents?

01:24.113 --> 01:25.755
Yeah, they're not that great.

01:26.791 --> 01:28.966
Ho ho ho!
The Ax-Man is ho-ho-home!

01:29.050 --> 01:30.212
Whoo! Axl's home!

01:30.286 --> 01:31.596
Axl's home, everybody!

01:31.674 --> 01:32.899
- Oh!
- Ah.

01:32.979 --> 01:34.538
There's my college boy!

01:34.643 --> 01:36.170
How was the drive?
Are you hungry?

01:36.253 --> 01:38.015
Starving. Lates.

01:38.093 --> 01:39.247
Oh. Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

01:39.338 --> 01:40.921
I was so excited
to hear about college

01:41.042 --> 01:43.667
and how your exams went--
well, exam.

01:43.791 --> 01:45.785
Yeah, uh, Darrin
got the new Xbox,

01:45.908 --> 01:47.809
so me and Sean
are heading over to his place.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.137
Oh, okay.

01:49.219 --> 01:51.476
Well, uh, will you be home
for dinner?

01:51.572 --> 01:52.789
- Nope.
- Oh.

01:52.899 --> 01:54.866
Well, then I guess
we'll see you tomorrow.

01:54.980 --> 01:56.392
Only if you're
looking at my picture

01:56.465 --> 01:57.402
in the hallway.

01:57.498 --> 01:59.709
Oh, come on, Axl.
We <i>have</i> to see you tomorrow.

01:59.856 --> 02:02.541
We were all gonna get the tree
and decorate it as a family.

02:02.635 --> 02:04.145
Yeah, that's a definite no.

02:04.216 --> 02:06.068
Uh, that's a definite yes.

02:06.193 --> 02:08.487
- What?
- This is a family holiday.

02:08.583 --> 02:09.598
If you think
you're gonna come home

02:09.692 --> 02:11.537
and blow off your family
for the entire Christmas,

02:11.627 --> 02:12.718
you got another thing coming.

02:12.811 --> 02:14.399
What? All of a sudden,
Christmas is about family?

02:14.485 --> 02:15.787
I'm asking for two minutes.

02:15.882 --> 02:16.902
I don't have to be
here for the family!

02:16.989 --> 02:17.962
It's Christmas! We
haven't seen you!

02:18.085 --> 02:19.620
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

02:19.722 --> 02:21.342
Apparently, mom was planning to

02:21.431 --> 02:22.792
hold me hostage all Christmas.

02:22.873 --> 02:24.249
Oh, you think
I'm holding you hostage?

02:24.330 --> 02:26.357
- I'll hold you hostage. You're grounded!
- What?!

02:26.454 --> 02:27.384
I've been home
for three minutes,

02:27.517 --> 02:28.409
and I'm already grounded?

02:28.496 --> 02:29.972
Oh! This is
the worst Christmas ever!

02:30.048 --> 02:31.371
Hey. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:31.453 --> 02:32.946
Let's not start
throwing that phrase around.

02:33.025 --> 02:34.561
This is the best Christmas ever

02:34.655 --> 02:36.750
'cause it's just
with the family...

02:36.838 --> 02:37.805
...like God intended.

02:37.882 --> 02:38.943
Mom is being totally unfair.

02:39.019 --> 02:40.643
I just got here,
and she's already telling me

02:40.737 --> 02:41.974
I can't hang out
with my friends!

02:42.053 --> 02:43.130
I did not say that.

02:43.207 --> 02:45.301
I said you couldn't hang out
with <i>just</i> your friends.

02:45.389 --> 02:46.778
You said it again!
You-- you just said it again!

02:46.889 --> 02:48.469
All I'm asking is for you to spend
a little time with your family.

02:48.550 --> 02:49.870
- All right, all right.
- All of a sudden, I can't see my friends.

02:49.965 --> 02:51.368
- Really!
- Let's have everybody just take a breath.

02:51.458 --> 02:52.374
Now, why don't you

02:52.467 --> 02:53.969
each make up a list
of the stuff you want?

02:54.053 --> 02:55.286
And I'm sure we can come
to a fair agreement

02:55.367 --> 02:57.450
and have the best Christmas
we've ever had.

02:57.529 --> 02:58.719
I'm happy to do that.

02:58.797 --> 03:00.251
Fine.

03:00.970 --> 03:02.060
Axl?!

03:02.142 --> 03:03.233
What, now?!

03:05.760 --> 03:09.027
Okay, I've looked at
the entire winter break,

03:09.187 --> 03:10.793
and I'm gonna write down
the number of hours

03:10.865 --> 03:13.478
I'm comfortable spending
with you people.

03:17.051 --> 03:18.244
Two?!

03:18.313 --> 03:19.919
You may spend them all at once
or spread them out.

03:20.009 --> 03:21.418
- Axl!
- What?

03:21.519 --> 03:22.747
God, why are you
so focused on me?

03:22.867 --> 03:25.506
I liked it better last year when
grandma and grandpa were here.

03:25.591 --> 03:27.292
Hey. Don't even
joke about that.

03:27.487 --> 03:29.875
Okay, then <i>I'll</i> start.

03:30.036 --> 03:31.379
Well, Tuesday night,
I really want you

03:31.458 --> 03:32.755
to come to Ehlert's
with us so we can

03:32.829 --> 03:34.526
all pick out
a Christmas tree together.

03:34.670 --> 03:36.235
I love
picking out the Christmas tree!

03:36.304 --> 03:37.205
Yeah, that's not gonna for me.

03:37.277 --> 03:39.615
I'm going night sledding with a
bunch of people at Killer Hill.

03:39.717 --> 03:41.358
Well, if you come with us
to pick up the tree,

03:41.441 --> 03:43.907
I could push the decorating
till after.

03:43.988 --> 03:45.442
Can't we just
get the tree the next night?

03:45.573 --> 03:46.513
If you can make that work,

03:46.602 --> 03:48.738
I'd be willing to throw in
two family dinners

03:48.884 --> 03:50.673
with light conversation.

03:51.034 --> 03:52.683
I was gonna
do cookies Wednesday,

03:52.749 --> 03:53.860
but I could move the cookies,

03:53.946 --> 03:56.124
and I <i>will</i> hold you
to your offer on the meals.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.046
Fine.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.590
I will give you Wednesday,
but that's a no on the cookies.

03:58.709 --> 03:59.884
Can you do cookies on Thursday?

03:59.954 --> 04:01.242
- I'm not doing cookies at all.
- Not even--

04:01.335 --> 04:03.311
- Cookies are off the table.
- Understood.

04:03.396 --> 04:04.642
Then I have to hold firm
to Thursday.

04:04.740 --> 04:06.693
Thursday, we're having chili
and doing the Christmas puzzle.

04:06.786 --> 04:08.708
I love
doing the Christmas puzzle!

04:08.803 --> 04:09.934
It takes like a year
to do that thing,

04:10.047 --> 04:11.752
and there's so many
missing pieces.

04:11.849 --> 04:14.967
It's just a bunch of wise men
in robes looking at a hole.

04:15.094 --> 04:17.199
Listen, I'm not giving up
the Christmas puzzle,

04:17.302 --> 04:18.728
but there is
a little wiggle room

04:18.826 --> 04:20.606
on caroling
with the church choir.

04:20.716 --> 04:24.267
Oh, I love caroling!
Dad, will you go with me?

04:24.379 --> 04:27.780
Uh, sorry, Sue, but your mom
already took it off the table.

04:27.904 --> 04:29.954
Now, the following
Tuesday night,

04:30.042 --> 04:32.885
I will be going to a bonfire
by the lake.

04:32.989 --> 04:34.974
On Christmas Eve?!
Are you kidding me?

04:35.063 --> 04:36.571
That's definitely
a family night.

04:36.699 --> 04:39.593
We've all having cocoa
and watching "White Christmas."

04:39.709 --> 04:41.410
Every year, you say
you're gonna watch it,

04:41.516 --> 04:44.233
and you and dad end up
with your hands down your pants,

04:44.337 --> 04:45.365
watching football.

04:45.462 --> 04:46.354
Well, not this year.

04:46.522 --> 04:49.046
I bought a copy on eBay,
and we are doing it.

04:49.145 --> 04:50.316
It's nonnegotiable.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.218
Oh, we get a nonnegotiable.

04:52.335 --> 04:55.827
Good. Then my nonnegotiable
is Joe's rager on Sunday!

04:55.971 --> 04:59.187
Fine. Then it looks like
we have a deal.

04:59.524 --> 05:00.940
Pleasure doing business
with you.

05:01.180 --> 05:01.959
Mm.

05:02.498 --> 05:04.388
Wrapping paper
is all ready to be returned.

05:06.570 --> 05:07.297
You better hope Santa

05:07.395 --> 05:09.495
puts an extra 97 bucks
in your stocking, pal,

05:09.596 --> 05:11.120
'cause this one's on you.

05:12.192 --> 05:14.066
Still, best Christmas ever.

05:15.586 --> 05:17.572
Family trip to
the Christmas-tree lot-- check!

05:17.654 --> 05:18.617
Don't wait up!

05:18.798 --> 05:20.971
Axl, you're still on the clock!

05:21.290 --> 05:24.170
Now get back here
and help us bring in the tree!

05:25.459 --> 05:28.230
I can't believe we finally
got a big tree this year.

05:28.340 --> 05:32.295
Our house is gonna be like
a magical Christmas wonderland.

05:32.436 --> 05:33.377
Now that I'm helping
carry this thing in,

05:33.463 --> 05:35.032
I'm gonna need you
to let me go to Hooters

05:35.115 --> 05:37.237
on Christmas
to watch football with my boys.

05:37.375 --> 05:39.568
First of all, you're not
going to Hooters on Christmas.

05:39.688 --> 05:41.646
Second, have you seen
the Orson Hooters?

05:41.808 --> 05:43.402
Yeah.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.467
Oh, this is so exciting!

05:46.583 --> 05:47.641
I can't believe
we actually have

05:47.741 --> 05:49.663
an "in front of
the window" tree.

05:49.781 --> 05:51.956
So, if we knew
the tag was mis-marked,

05:52.044 --> 05:53.678
shouldn't we have told the guy
at the tree lot?

05:53.807 --> 05:55.664
Well, Brick, that's
an interesting dilemma.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.586
And if you're rich, then yes.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.986
All right.
Hope everybody's happy.

06:00.089 --> 06:02.526
'Cause that's where it's staying
till Valentine's Day.

06:02.668 --> 06:04.208
Scissors.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:14.976 --> 06:16.393
Brick?!
Where's Brick?!

06:16.610 --> 06:19.651
In here!
Can't find my way out.

06:20.210 --> 06:21.666
<i>Which wasn't the only situation</i>

06:21.768 --> 06:23.721
<i>he was stuck</i>
<i>finding his way out of.</i>

06:24.095 --> 06:27.750
<i>Yep, he had to find $97,</i>
<i>and fast.</i>

06:28.951 --> 06:30.367
Happy holidays,
Mr. Webber.

06:30.528 --> 06:32.149
I'll be here
only while supplies last.

06:32.290 --> 06:33.650
Tell your friends.

06:33.909 --> 06:34.905
What you got going there?

06:35.096 --> 06:36.793
Oh, I'm selling popcorn
for the church.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.942
This mood ring is the prize
for selling 30 tins.

06:39.103 --> 06:42.529
So, what do you say?
Can I put you down for 28 tins?

06:42.680 --> 06:44.237
I'm using the money
from the popcorn

06:44.350 --> 06:46.201
to pay back
the wrapping-paper people.

06:46.374 --> 06:47.268
Uh-huh.

06:47.397 --> 06:49.246
How are you gonna pay back
the popcorn people?

06:50.360 --> 06:52.819
According to my mood ring,
I'm not that worried about it.

07:00.184 --> 07:01.428
Hey, perfect timing.

07:01.538 --> 07:02.865
We just started
decorating the tree.

07:02.972 --> 07:04.482
Started?
I'm almost done.

07:05.035 --> 07:06.562
Axl, what are you doing?

07:06.661 --> 07:08.421
You can't just
fling stuff at the tree.

07:08.517 --> 07:09.643
You have to care.

07:09.745 --> 07:10.646
Oh, no, mnh-mnh.

07:10.726 --> 07:11.781
I looked at the terms
of our agreement,

07:11.866 --> 07:13.847
and our deal
has no mention of caring.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.873
Come on, Axl,
stop being snarky.

07:16.031 --> 07:16.982
You know your mom.

07:17.065 --> 07:19.590
She won't count this as a family
event unless you enjoy it.

07:19.738 --> 07:21.454
Well okay, fine. It's a blast.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.366
I'm having an explosion of fun!

07:23.662 --> 07:25.236
Uh, okay,
now you're being sarcastic.

07:25.328 --> 07:26.546
You're being
snarky and sarcastic,

07:26.660 --> 07:27.849
and I don't think
any of us want to hear

07:27.945 --> 07:30.708
any more of your...
snarcasm.

07:30.850 --> 07:33.435
Look!
This one's my favorite!

07:35.189 --> 07:36.664
Do you mind?

07:36.736 --> 07:38.692
I have a few fun things
I'm still allowed to go to,

07:38.791 --> 07:40.033
and I can't afford to get sick.

07:40.135 --> 07:42.429
I'm not sick!

07:42.628 --> 07:44.740
Oh, I'm perfectly fine.

07:44.904 --> 07:46.212
I have no idea
why I'm sneezing.

07:59.543 --> 08:01.133
Oh, no!

08:01.273 --> 08:03.398
I'm allergic to Christmas!

08:13.724 --> 08:15.831
<i>So, apparently, our new,</i>
<i>giant Christmas tree</i>

08:15.933 --> 08:18.258
<i>had created a new,</i>
<i>giant Christmas allergy,</i>

08:18.431 --> 08:20.317
<i>but Sue had a solution.</i>

08:21.108 --> 08:22.637
<i>I didn't say it was a good one.</i>

08:24.254 --> 08:25.420
Mom, we need more sprinkles

08:25.524 --> 08:27.074
on these Santa cookies.

08:27.188 --> 08:28.216
Can you believe
the prairie scouts

08:28.308 --> 08:29.884
gave me this awesome
voice modulator

08:29.993 --> 08:31.624
just for selling
peppermint bark?

08:31.708 --> 08:32.868
You realize
you're gonna have to use

08:32.945 --> 08:35.537
the peppermint-bark money
to pay off the popcorn people?

08:35.678 --> 08:37.409
Right.

08:40.097 --> 08:42.472
Hey. What's going on
with your arms?

08:42.568 --> 08:44.376
Are you breaking out in hives?

08:44.454 --> 08:45.425
Hives?

08:45.517 --> 08:47.135
No, dad don't be silly.

08:47.250 --> 08:48.804
These are just excitement bumps

08:48.889 --> 08:51.262
because I am so pumped
for Christmas.

08:53.055 --> 08:54.928
There she goes.
Time to rinse again.

08:55.675 --> 08:58.139
These need more sprinkles.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.824
That's what I told her.

09:00.086 --> 09:02.270
All right,
have fun making cookies

09:02.347 --> 09:04.358
with Megaphone Boy
and Snot Cousteau.

09:05.298 --> 09:07.586
BT-dubs, Joe's party's
gonna be slammin'.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.399
So, uh, don't wait up for me.

09:09.485 --> 09:13.230
♪ fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-lame ♪

09:14.214 --> 09:16.218
There-- I went caroling.
That's a freebie.

09:27.724 --> 09:28.923
Mm. Hey, mom.

09:29.026 --> 09:31.439
Can I interest you
in a decorative crock-pot cozy?

09:31.562 --> 09:32.803
Now you can
leave your crock-pot out

09:32.907 --> 09:33.840
where everyone can see

09:33.952 --> 09:36.408
and save yourself
unwanted embarrassment.

09:36.527 --> 09:37.562
It's for the women's club.

09:37.676 --> 09:40.061
These glasses are the prize
for being their top seller.

09:40.226 --> 09:41.020
Let me guess.

09:41.111 --> 09:42.105
You're using the cozy money

09:42.193 --> 09:44.254
to pay off
the peppermint-bark people.

09:44.389 --> 09:45.403
Exactly.

09:45.487 --> 09:47.015
Brick, you're running
a Ponzi scheme.

09:47.153 --> 09:48.511
A Ponzi-what, now?

09:49.537 --> 09:50.713
You're using money
you don't have

09:50.793 --> 09:52.077
to pay off the debt
you had before,

09:52.171 --> 09:53.830
and now you got to go
into even more debt

09:53.932 --> 09:54.912
to pay off this debt.

09:54.986 --> 09:57.570
It's an endless cycle.
You're never gonna catch up.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.387
Isn't that what you guys do
with your credit cards?

09:59.546 --> 10:02.649
Well, yeah, but we're gonna die
before they catch us.

10:03.115 --> 10:04.193
Hmm.

10:05.612 --> 10:06.904
Oh, my God, call the police!

10:07.079 --> 10:08.812
- What? What's going on?
- What?

10:08.936 --> 10:11.271
Somebody stole
our Christmas tree!

10:11.634 --> 10:13.735
Sue, calm down. Nobody stole anything.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.258
I took it to the curb.

10:15.568 --> 10:18.270
What?!
I love that tree!

10:18.403 --> 10:20.334
Why would you
get rid of the tree?

10:21.106 --> 10:23.386
Because it was
slowly killing you?

10:23.593 --> 10:24.796
A-a-and think about it.

10:24.887 --> 10:27.288
Christmas isn't about
the tree, right?

10:27.395 --> 10:30.575
It's about the spirit, and look.
We decorated a new tree.

10:32.198 --> 10:34.451
That's not a tree!

10:34.587 --> 10:36.375
Of course it is about the tree.

10:36.512 --> 10:39.140
There isn't one Christmas song
that doesn't mention a tree.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.905
"Oh, Christmas plant"?

10:41.007 --> 10:42.059
I don't think so!

10:42.205 --> 10:44.758
Oh, my God.
I ruined Christmas!

10:47.705 --> 10:49.326
You heard her, people.

10:49.421 --> 10:50.548
She ruined Christmas.

10:50.596 --> 10:52.714
Oh, well. Guess I'll just have
to find something else to do.

10:52.796 --> 10:55.019
I think there's
a bonfire tomorrow night.

10:55.103 --> 10:57.987
No, Axl. Christmas Eve
was my nonnegotiable.

10:58.085 --> 10:59.262
You already got yours.

10:59.344 --> 11:00.576
But I made the wrong choice!

11:00.746 --> 11:02.417
Joe's party was so lame.
It shouldn't even count.

11:02.511 --> 11:05.939
After we made cookies, I had to
jitterbug with his grandma.

11:06.079 --> 11:09.202
She kept touching my face.
She called me Donald.

11:10.019 --> 11:11.674
Look, I'm sorry,
but we had a deal.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.090
It's gonna be fun,

11:13.200 --> 11:15.470
and trust me, you're gonna love
"White Christmas."

11:15.559 --> 11:18.491
It's one of the best
movie musicals of all time.

11:18.579 --> 11:20.536
Oh, my God.
It's a musical?!

11:20.740 --> 11:21.842
That should have been disclosed

11:21.932 --> 11:23.415
at the beginning
of negotiations!

11:23.515 --> 11:25.286
Why?

11:25.700 --> 11:28.211
<i>I felt sorry for Axl,</i>
<i>but not that sorry.</i>

11:28.315 --> 11:30.642
<i>He made a deal,</i>
<i>and now he needed to go limp,</i>

11:30.740 --> 11:33.775
<i>stop fighting it, and get into</i>
<i>the freakin' spirit already.</i>

11:33.889 --> 11:35.248
<i>I know I was.</i>

11:39.384 --> 11:41.622
I can definitely
get you three plants, Mr. Hayes.

11:41.718 --> 11:42.872
But if you want them
by Christmas Eve,

11:42.950 --> 11:45.255
I'm gonna have to
add a $5 rush fee.

11:45.479 --> 11:47.141
All right.

11:48.182 --> 11:48.855
Brick...

11:48.948 --> 11:49.690
It's okay.

11:49.765 --> 11:50.794
I'm gonna use the money
from these

11:50.868 --> 11:52.878
to pay for the cozies, which
paid for the peppermint bark,

11:52.970 --> 11:54.035
which paid for the popcorn,

11:54.114 --> 11:55.664
which paid for
the wrapping paper.

11:56.031 --> 11:57.771
How are you gonna pay
for the poinsettias?

11:57.916 --> 12:00.090
Oh, these were free.
I got them from the park.

12:00.496 --> 12:01.573
What park?

12:01.795 --> 12:03.156
The park with the dead people.

12:04.021 --> 12:05.567
The cemetery?!

12:05.682 --> 12:07.869
You stole flowers
from the cemetery?!

12:08.129 --> 12:09.415
What the hell
were you thinking?!

12:09.551 --> 12:12.179
Quick, get these inside.

12:17.212 --> 12:20.959
A little higher
a-and just a tad lower.

12:21.054 --> 12:23.066
Hi, mom.
Isn't this a great idea?

12:23.178 --> 12:24.434
I can still
see the tree from here,

12:24.540 --> 12:25.975
but I'm not sneezing anymore.

12:26.164 --> 12:29.219
I am gonna stay in here
all Christmas!

12:31.480 --> 12:33.095
Okay.
Now, lower still.

12:33.364 --> 12:34.729
Unh-unh.
Split the difference.

12:41.152 --> 12:42.446
Okay, since it's Christmas Eve,

12:42.519 --> 12:43.547
I'm gonna let you open your gifts

12:43.634 --> 12:45.793
from grandma and grandpa.

12:46.280 --> 12:49.697
♪ <i>We wish you a merry Christmas</i>
<i>and a happy new year</i> ♪

12:49.781 --> 12:50.964
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What did you guys get?!

12:51.048 --> 12:52.353
Is it good?!
Hold it up so I can see it!

12:52.465 --> 12:56.342
Wow, electronic poker.
"Better than Pong."

12:56.480 --> 12:57.539
Awesome.

12:57.607 --> 12:58.697
Axl.

12:59.518 --> 13:01.750
Hey!

13:05.557 --> 13:07.547
They got me a book
on interpreting dreams!

13:07.689 --> 13:10.047
I have always dreamed
of getting one of these!

13:10.163 --> 13:12.618
I wonder what that means? Oh!

13:12.722 --> 13:15.226
All right, Axl,
take all this to the garbage,

13:15.331 --> 13:17.239
and I will microwave
the hot chocolate

13:17.322 --> 13:20.861
so we can watch
"White Christmas"!

13:22.525 --> 13:24.244
Oh, there's the door!
Who's there?! Who's there?!

13:24.371 --> 13:25.937
Is someone at the door?!

13:26.046 --> 13:27.127
Is someone knocking?!

13:27.261 --> 13:29.353
- Happy holidays!
- Happy holidays!

13:29.520 --> 13:30.753
Is Axl home?

13:30.883 --> 13:33.440
Uh, sure. Come on in.

13:35.144 --> 13:36.163
Axl!

13:37.955 --> 13:39.593
Oh, my gosh.
Look, Court.

13:39.716 --> 13:42.239
The Hecks are hosting
a sick child for the holidays.

13:42.335 --> 13:43.388
Isn't that sweet?

13:43.469 --> 13:44.508
So sweet!

13:44.622 --> 13:46.009
Hi, bubble girl.

13:46.138 --> 13:49.048
I'm not a bubble girl.
I'm Sue.

13:49.223 --> 13:53.297
We've met so many times.
I-I'm Axl's sister.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.039
No, I don't think so.

13:55.151 --> 13:56.491
Does Axl have a sister, Court?

13:56.614 --> 13:58.848
No, he's never mentioned
a sick sister to me, Deb.

13:58.985 --> 14:01.902
I'm not sick!
I live here!

14:02.023 --> 14:03.849
That's right.
You live!

14:03.948 --> 14:05.858
You live every single day

14:05.935 --> 14:07.803
like it's your last,
bubble girl!

14:07.881 --> 14:09.897
We're totally gonna do
a charity fun run for you

14:09.998 --> 14:11.443
when the weather gets warmer.

14:11.708 --> 14:13.566
Hey! What up, ladies?!

14:13.644 --> 14:15.507
Uh, please do not feed the Sue.

14:15.645 --> 14:17.251
We've sealed it into
its natural dork-itat

14:17.343 --> 14:19.455
and can't find anything
that'll mate with it, so...

14:20.380 --> 14:21.669
Ohh!

14:22.209 --> 14:23.967
Do you want to ride with us
to the bonfire?

14:24.044 --> 14:25.235
They're asking people
to carpool

14:25.334 --> 14:27.872
'cause the party's
gonna be so huge, right, Deb?

14:27.944 --> 14:29.863
Totally. All the cheerleaders
are coming,

14:29.985 --> 14:31.863
even the new Swedish girl
who just broke up

14:31.950 --> 14:33.113
with her boyfriend.

14:33.192 --> 14:34.840
Oh!

14:34.987 --> 14:37.229
Seriously, I need to go to
this bonfire, please.

14:37.346 --> 14:38.442
I'm not above begging here.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.671
Please, I've never asked you
for anything in my life!

14:40.780 --> 14:42.582
First of all, you have.

14:42.679 --> 14:44.933
Second of all, no.
It's Christmas Eve.

14:45.011 --> 14:47.237
You committed to being
with the family-- end of story.

14:47.435 --> 14:50.098
Wow. Your grandma's
really strict.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.205
- Isn't she, Deb?
- Super strict.

14:52.315 --> 14:53.224
Well, bye, Axl.

14:53.304 --> 14:54.119
We'll think of you
when we're doing

14:54.200 --> 14:56.687
our naked polar-bear plunge
in Briar's Pond.

14:59.192 --> 15:01.721
Oh... my God!

15:02.432 --> 15:04.117
Can this night get any worse?

15:04.214 --> 15:06.039
I had to water down the cocoa
'cause we're low on milk,

15:06.121 --> 15:07.852
and don't eat
the snowman cookies

15:07.957 --> 15:09.186
'cause they're rank
for some reason,

15:09.283 --> 15:13.474
but it's all good 'cause we are
gonna watch "White Christmas"!

15:13.843 --> 15:16.182
Oh, is it starting?!

15:16.315 --> 15:17.226
Can you turn it up louder?

15:17.337 --> 15:19.423
Oh, my God.
This movie's so old!

15:19.542 --> 15:21.769
What's a VistaVision?

15:26.702 --> 15:28.538
What are they saying?

15:28.698 --> 15:30.712
Wait. How do
you turn this to English?

15:30.841 --> 15:34.701
Irving Berlin's
"Weisse Weihnachten"?

15:34.862 --> 15:36.904
Frankie, you bought
the thing in German.

15:36.983 --> 15:37.724
What?

15:37.815 --> 15:39.770
Oh, damn it!

15:39.860 --> 15:42.056
I knew 72 cents
was too good of a deal.

15:42.206 --> 15:44.202
Well... we tried.

15:44.281 --> 15:45.820
Darn, I was really looking
forward to watching this.

15:45.917 --> 15:47.412
You're not going anywhere.

15:47.490 --> 15:48.587
Besides, I've seen this
a million times.

15:48.667 --> 15:50.285
I can explain what's happening.

15:50.433 --> 15:53.287
Okay, now, this is the war part.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.636
Axl, you should like that.

15:54.766 --> 15:55.951
And that's the general.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.653
Oh, and those two soldiers
are song-and-dance men.

15:58.754 --> 16:00.126
Song-and-dance men?

16:00.249 --> 16:02.984
What are they gonna do--
bore the enemy into submission?

16:03.085 --> 16:06.080
You know, this is all
just setup. Let's move ahead.

16:07.923 --> 16:10.660
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
This part is so funny!

16:10.759 --> 16:12.218
Okay, they have to pretend
to be women

16:12.340 --> 16:13.831
and get on a train
to leave town

16:13.918 --> 16:15.357
'cause they didn't pay
their rent.

16:15.427 --> 16:17.669
When Bing Crosby finds out,
he gets so mad!

16:17.747 --> 16:19.631
Ha!
It sounds funny, mom!

16:19.726 --> 16:22.591
I can't see it,
but it sounds funny.

16:22.678 --> 16:23.446
So, they dress up like women

16:23.560 --> 16:25.547
to escape the police
on the train?

16:25.683 --> 16:27.218
No, they dress up
like women to perform

16:27.348 --> 16:29.408
so the policemen
have to stay and watch.

16:29.506 --> 16:31.583
Uh, I'm not
explaining it right.

16:31.697 --> 16:34.303
Ow, ow, ow, hot, hot!

16:34.402 --> 16:36.661
Wait, who does George Clooney's
aunt fall in love with?

16:36.812 --> 16:39.593
Bob, Bing Crosby.
They sang a song together.

16:39.684 --> 16:41.058
Here. Let me go back.

16:41.246 --> 16:43.366
Oh, no!

16:43.556 --> 16:46.284
No more going back!
I can't believe this!

16:46.444 --> 16:48.099
All my friends from high school
are back in town

16:48.184 --> 16:49.619
at the world's
most awesome bonfire,

16:49.704 --> 16:51.670
and I'm stuck here,
talking to you people,

16:51.767 --> 16:52.686
drinking cocoa water,

16:52.767 --> 16:54.936
and watching some weird
German war movie

16:55.017 --> 16:56.065
where dudes sit around
in bow ties,

16:56.163 --> 16:57.214
singing to each other!

16:57.347 --> 16:59.290
Don't you get it?
I'm older now.

16:59.391 --> 17:00.916
I'm an adult,
and I have rights.

17:00.980 --> 17:03.730
This is my vacation, too,
and I'm glad you love the movie!

17:03.837 --> 17:06.224
I love bonfires!
Well, you know what?!

17:06.358 --> 17:07.713
You can make me
stay in this house,

17:07.800 --> 17:10.086
but you can't make me
watch this movie!

17:13.651 --> 17:14.778
You want me to go get him?

17:15.385 --> 17:18.358
No. You know what?
He's right.

17:18.472 --> 17:19.584
This is lame.

17:19.840 --> 17:21.920
Why don't you tell him
to go to his party?

17:22.414 --> 17:24.596
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.966
Hey, what's--
what's happening?

17:29.055 --> 17:30.643
Who's walking by?
Are we taking a break?

17:33.021 --> 17:34.334
Hey.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.581
Why don't you go ahead
and go to that bonfire?

17:38.168 --> 17:39.062
Seriously?

17:39.177 --> 17:40.100
Yeah.

17:40.168 --> 17:41.628
Yes!
This is awesome!

17:41.774 --> 17:43.026
Thanks, dad.

17:43.115 --> 17:44.151
I knew you'd come through
for me.

17:44.258 --> 17:46.698
Actually, it was
your mom's idea to let you go.

17:47.217 --> 17:48.837
Really?

17:48.958 --> 17:50.252
Look, Axl, you're home
from college,

17:50.350 --> 17:51.636
and you want to spend time
with your friends.

17:51.708 --> 17:52.644
- We get that.
- Yeah.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.595
But, uh, your mom knows
she's only got you

17:54.689 --> 17:58.219
for a few more years, and,
well, it's not just your mom.

17:58.324 --> 17:59.659
It's me, too.

18:00.573 --> 18:02.060
Time goes fast, you know,

18:02.153 --> 18:03.774
the whole
"Cat's In The Cradle" thing.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.222
That's why I wanted to have
Christmas with just the family.

18:07.723 --> 18:10.224
Well, that, and your
grandparents are nuts.

18:10.317 --> 18:11.753
Yeah.

18:12.016 --> 18:13.140
Hey, what's
"Cat's In The Cradle"?

18:14.009 --> 18:16.138
Well, it's a song from the '70s.
You've heard it.

18:16.251 --> 18:17.664
Uh, no.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.222
"My child arrived
just the other day,

18:19.321 --> 18:20.579
came into the world
in the usual way."

18:23.007 --> 18:24.648
"There were planes to catch
and bills to pay.

18:24.726 --> 18:27.240
He learned to walk
while I was away."

18:27.537 --> 18:30.444
Anyway, the kid
goes off to college and...

18:30.833 --> 18:32.920
gets married, you know,
starts a family,

18:33.008 --> 18:35.321
and the dad starts to
slow down, and...

18:36.605 --> 18:39.036
"I've long since retired.
My son's moved away.

18:39.574 --> 18:41.339
I called him up
just the other day.

18:41.550 --> 18:43.177
Said, 'I'd like to see you
if you don't mind.'

18:43.266 --> 18:46.115
He said, 'I'd love to, dad,
if I could find the time.

18:46.410 --> 18:49.067
See, my new job's a hassle,
and the kids have the flu,

18:49.282 --> 18:52.093
but it's sure nice
talking to you, dad.

18:52.282 --> 18:53.548
It was sure...'"

18:59.401 --> 19:02.661
Anyway...
it was a pretty famous song.

19:03.938 --> 19:05.360
Have fun at the bonfire.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.544
Yep. I will.

19:15.596 --> 19:18.178
Hey, Sue.
What you doing out here?

19:18.355 --> 19:21.019
I finally figured out
a way to enjoy the tree

19:21.127 --> 19:22.637
and still breathe.

19:23.376 --> 19:25.552
So pretty.

19:25.857 --> 19:28.749
Well, it really is.

19:29.525 --> 19:31.155
I'm glad we got
the big tree this year.

19:31.435 --> 19:32.518
Me too.

19:33.930 --> 19:35.446
Next year, we're getting
an artificial one.

19:35.548 --> 19:36.976
I know.

19:37.874 --> 19:39.368
Hey.

19:39.460 --> 19:40.504
What you guys doing?

19:40.599 --> 19:43.249
Just sitting out here,
enjoying the sights.

19:46.954 --> 19:47.790
Mm.

19:48.788 --> 19:49.767
Hmm.

19:59.127 --> 20:02.042
Hey.

20:02.671 --> 20:04.439
I thought you were
going to the bonfire.

20:04.502 --> 20:06.943
Yeah.
I don't know.

20:07.020 --> 20:10.955
I was a little tired, so...
just decided to hang here.

20:47.805 --> 20:49.049
So, it's like this kid's born,

20:49.187 --> 20:50.231
and he starts to grow up,

20:50.301 --> 20:51.874
and he wants to be
just like his dad.

20:52.532 --> 20:53.726
And they have a cat?

20:54.129 --> 20:56.155
I'm not exactly sure
where the cat comes in

20:56.261 --> 20:58.968
or the cradle, but, basically

20:59.050 --> 21:00.715
this kid just wants to hang out
with his dad all the time,

21:00.804 --> 21:02.462
but his dad's too busy
with work.

21:02.591 --> 21:03.474
And then at
the end of the song,

21:03.554 --> 21:05.639
the dad's like really old.

21:05.744 --> 21:07.400
All he wants to do is
spend time with his kid,

21:07.520 --> 21:09.437
but now the kid's busy
with his own family,

21:09.526 --> 21:12.836
and, uh... he just
can't find the time.

21:12.947 --> 21:14.010
What happens?

21:14.084 --> 21:15.897
Does he get to spend time
with his son?

21:17.322 --> 21:20.292
The song doesn't say, but

21:20.422 --> 21:22.678
the kid's pretty busy, so...

21:23.311 --> 21:25.403
I'm assuming
the dad eventually dies.

21:28.397 --> 21:30.093
***

21:30.503 --> 21:33.053
I'm calling dad at work.
