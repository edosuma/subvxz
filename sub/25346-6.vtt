00:09.259 --> 00:11.344
I'll catch up with you.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.930
Got the assault rifle. Have a lot of ammo.

00:32.532 --> 00:34.826
No, no, no. He's got to do better.

Okay, boys, this week
we've got a Middle Eastern boy. Yay!

00:50.133 --> 00:51.676
[all shouting]

00:51.760 --> 00:53.928
This one's Arian. He goes by Ari.

00:54.012 --> 00:58.058
He's 24, 5'9, and 155 pounds.
He's my twin.

00:58.141 --> 01:01.352
-You wish you were 24.
-Don't be fooled by the hair.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.731
His nominator is Matt,
who's his best friend.

01:04.814 --> 01:06.149
Ari grew up in Iran.

01:06.232 --> 01:09.110
He was there until he was 12,
then he moved to the U.S.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.696
Last month Ari moved out
of his parents' house,

01:11.780 --> 01:14.157
and he now lives with his buddy Cyrus.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.202
He has been working as a food server.
However, he keeps getting fired.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.286
Oh.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.790
He loves to smoke cigarettes,
and plays video games.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.209
He lives on
pizza, ice cream, and beer.

01:24.292 --> 01:27.962
-You're painting a winning picture.
-I know.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.340
-Stay with me this time.
-Yeah.

-Don't lose each other.
-I'm not. I killed the dude.

My best friend Matt, uh, nominated me
for Queer Eye.

01:37.555 --> 01:40.850
I don't know why, man.
I think I'm perfect, but, uh...

01:42.352 --> 01:43.520
[laughing]

01:43.603 --> 01:47.440
I have known Arian so long.
He's the closest to a brother I have.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.359
I feel like Arian is in a funk.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.821
He's really unsure
with what he wants to do in life.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.949
He doesn't see his potential.

01:56.032 --> 01:58.868
Life after college, it's a lot harder.

-Right now, I live with my friend Cyrus.
-The nickname I gave him is Dick-dog.

02:08.962 --> 02:12.507
That's just his personality,
a class clown type of person.

02:12.590 --> 02:16.052
I would consider myself
the most average roommate, ever.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.054
I do the bulk of the cleaning.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.306
He'll help a little bit
with the dishes.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.558

I don't go above and beyond to, like,
be, you know, a goody good roommate,

02:27.230 --> 02:30.441

I would say I'm fine.

02:32.485 --> 02:37.073
The most exercise Arian gets is
walking to the couch.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.785
He used to have
this really great sense of fashion,

02:40.869 --> 02:44.080
and he used to always spend
all his money on clothes,

02:44.164 --> 02:46.708
and now he can't fit
into those clothes.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.918
Because Arian can't fit
into his old clothes,

02:49.002 --> 02:52.088
he's not very motivated
to go out and find a job

02:52.171 --> 02:53.798
or to go out in public

02:53.882 --> 02:57.677
because he's embarrassed
that he has to wear stretchy shorts

02:57.760 --> 03:00.847
and, like, clothes that stretch now.

was gonna be the best.

I had a job lined up,

and the crap hit the fan.

03:09.856 --> 03:13.610
Arian is not officially graduated.
He has one class he failed.

03:13.693 --> 03:18.239
He is a little embarrassed
about his last semester at school.

03:18.323 --> 03:22.911
Until he can get that class taken care of,
he's not officially graduated.

We really want what's best for him,
but he needs to cut the bull crap.

in the ass yet,

to help me with that.

at the moment.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.218
I'm trying to work it out.
So, I graduated, walked,

06:25.301 --> 06:26.677
had the ceremony,

06:26.761 --> 06:29.847
and three weeks later,
I get a letter from my school,

06:29.931 --> 06:34.268
and they're like, "You didn't graduate.
You need to sign up for classes."

06:36.229 --> 06:37.271
[Karamo] Got it.

06:37.355 --> 06:40.900
I'm like, "What?"
I already walked and I took a picture--

06:40.983 --> 06:42.860
-I took pictures.
-[laughing]

06:42.944 --> 06:46.906
So, you do know you can't say anymore
that you graduated.

06:46.989 --> 06:49.492
Let's rewind.
You said, "I graduated,"

06:49.575 --> 06:52.787
and then you said,
"I got a letter that said I didn't."

06:52.870 --> 06:55.414
-Right.
-There was a disconnect there.

06:55.498 --> 07:00.253
So, when I said that was your degree,
the answer is, I don't have one.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.922
-I don't have a degree. Got you.
-Good.

-Uh, I do.

-It's, uh, right here.

-[Karamo] Oh, I noticed this.
-Yeah.

07:45.381 --> 07:48.843
-This was what you wore to walk the stage.
-Yeah.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.053
-Were your parents there?
-All my family was.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.890
It was such a relieving moment, you know.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.851
But your mama doesn't know
you didn't graduate.

07:56.934 --> 07:59.103

-[Karamo] We're gonna work on that.

is it?

[Antoni] No, it's not the best.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.609
No, no. Keep that on.

08:04.692 --> 08:07.236
You've got five of us
who are gonna support you.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.322
-You're all chill as heck.
-Yeah.

08:09.405 --> 08:13.159

to cover up the smell of old things.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.952
Why's that wet?

08:15.036 --> 08:16.579
You've got a bit of a beer belly.

08:16.662 --> 08:19.165
But you live in gym clothes.
Are you going to the gym?

08:19.248 --> 08:20.458
-Uh...
-Are you working out?

08:20.541 --> 08:23.544
I got nothing to say.
I got nothing. I got nothing

08:23.628 --> 08:25.630
I'm looking at you in gym clothes,

08:25.713 --> 08:27.840
-is this your regular outfit?
-Yeah.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.967
-Show me what other clothes you've got.
-Sure.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.053
Apparently, you love fashion.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.888
-Right.
-I wanna see.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.807
-I'm struggling to believe it.
-All right.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.851
[Tan] What's your favorite thing
in your closet?

08:38.935 --> 08:41.896
This is one of my favorite.
I love the color a lot.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.148
A hoodie is your favorite thing?

08:44.232 --> 08:48.528
I mean, I can pick something nicer,
but I just like that hoodie so much.

08:48.611 --> 08:52.657
Show me the jeans you'd wear with it.
He's interesting when it comes to fashion.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.201
I would probably do something like this.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.578
-I like the colors together.
-Yeah.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.829
I'm surprised.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.457
He's got a lot of pieces
that are great.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.876
I want him to feel good
in his own skin.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.046
I want him to know that when he puts
his clothes on,

09:07.129 --> 09:08.631
that his body looks its best.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.384
You've got nice clothes in here.
Lovely.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.302
-I would wear that shirt.
-Yeah.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.054
I would wear this T-shirt.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.014
A lot of these things,
I'm shocked.

09:17.098 --> 09:20.601
Super surprising, like, great.
It makes my job much easier.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.353
You've got so much
that I would wear,

09:22.436 --> 09:25.898
but if you're not taking care
of your food, your body,

09:25.982 --> 09:28.776
-you're not gonna look great.
-Right.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.820
-Do you know how to make anything?
-Uh...

09:31.946 --> 09:34.240
Any, like, traditional dishes,

09:34.323 --> 09:36.576
like, anything that your mom made,

09:36.659 --> 09:38.828
-anything she makes now?
-Uh, not really.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.956
What's that traditional dish
cooked in a Bundt cake mold

09:42.039 --> 09:45.334
and it was crispy saffron rice
with, I think, turmeric.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.295
Sometimes there are potatoes.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.422
-You're talking about tadig?
-Yes.

09:49.505 --> 09:52.800
It's crispy rice on the outside,
the center is soft

09:52.883 --> 09:55.011
and you can put things in it.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.179
-Right.
-Your face is lighting up.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.764
Are you familiar with it?

09:58.848 --> 10:00.558
It's the most awesomest thing.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.685
It's so flavorful, too.

10:02.768 --> 10:05.521
Yeah, my mom's, like,
super good at it, too.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.815
You eat at home every night?
You're a waiter?

10:07.898 --> 10:10.484
-Right.
-Sorry, you did work as a waiter.

10:10.568 --> 10:14.405
Yeah, yep. So, I-- Yeah.

10:14.488 --> 10:16.324
When's the last time
you had a paycheck?

10:16.407 --> 10:17.450
Uh, last one...

10:17.867 --> 10:19.744
Uh... Uh...

10:20.995 --> 10:22.955
Like, last week or something.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.957
I just recently quit this job.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.918
Ari, I'm confused
'cause when we walked in,

10:28.002 --> 10:30.504
Karamo and I asked you
if you were working,

10:30.588 --> 10:33.424
and you said yes,
you were taking a summer day.

10:34.133 --> 10:38.012
Uh, I don't know
what you're talking about. [laughs]

10:38.095 --> 10:40.848
Us Fab 5,
we have a great bull crap monitor.

10:40.931 --> 10:43.059
So, you're not working now, you quit?

10:43.142 --> 10:46.604
Uh... Okay, do you want me to be honest?

10:46.687 --> 10:47.647
-Yes.
-Yeah.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.691
And our bull crap monitor is
off the charts.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.694
I just started a job,
like, four, five days ago.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.071
-Okay.
-Okay.

10:55.154 --> 10:59.033
With Arian, it takes you
a certain number of questions

10:59.116 --> 11:01.994
to get him to a point
where he's being honest.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.455
-What kind of job?
-It's a hookah bar.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.165
-You work as...?
-[Arian] A server.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.541
As a server. Okay.

11:10.127 --> 11:11.003
Oh...

11:13.422 --> 11:17.259
Oh... This is so sad.
This photo was turned over.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.389
[Jonathan] Tell me,
what's a morning in the life?

11:21.472 --> 11:25.726
You know, just wash my face.
I put some water on my hair just to...

11:25.810 --> 11:27.645
-Wet it down a little?
-Yeah.

11:27.728 --> 11:31.107
-What about sunscreen?
-No, I don't believe in that. [chuckles]

11:31.190 --> 11:35.361
-Why?
-It's an extra step, extra cost.

11:35.444 --> 11:40.533
Extra cost, so, money is an issue
when it comes to buying stuff for you.

11:40.616 --> 11:41.826
Yeah. I mean, yeah.

11:41.909 --> 11:44.578
Well, that's okay.
We can deal with that.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.831
Ah.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.209
[cheering]

11:50.292 --> 11:53.421
When's the last time
you didn't have a beard?

11:53.504 --> 11:57.591
Yeah. Yeah, I've been-- Yeah.
I mean, I like my beard.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.635
[Jonathan]
Ari's main principles of grooming is,

11:59.718 --> 12:03.889
how do I do as least work possible
and as least time as possible?

12:03.973 --> 12:06.934
I don't want him to be, like,
a lazy, hairy-faced 24-year-old.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.853
He has the rest of his life
for a beard.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.730
-I'm not gonna shave right now.
-Not right now.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.566
-I know you're not.
-Yeah.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.568
-We'll discuss.
-Trim it.

12:15.651 --> 12:16.902
We're gonna feel it out.

12:16.986 --> 12:20.322
Nah. I'm not even gonna entertain
in eating that.

12:20.406 --> 12:24.618
You know how I eat everything?
This is not one of those moments.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.787
-I notice out here...
-Yeah.

12:27.663 --> 12:30.249
A, it's disgusting,
but the biggest thing...

12:30.332 --> 12:31.375
-Yeah.
-These.

12:31.459 --> 12:35.087
-Does your roommate smoke?
-[Arian] No, he doesn't, no.

12:35.171 --> 12:39.550
So, he has to walk by and see
and smell this every day and night.

12:39.633 --> 12:40.718
Yes.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.971
-[Karamo] Do you feel overwhelmed?
-Yeah, I definitely do.

12:44.054 --> 12:47.099
What was your parents' expectations
for you?

12:47.183 --> 12:49.810
I mean, the Middle Eastern culture is,

12:49.894 --> 12:52.938
that they want their sons and daughters
to, like,

12:53.022 --> 12:58.402
become a doctor or lawyer
or whatever, and, you know, so...

12:58.486 --> 13:01.363
The school situation.
I know you haven't finished

13:01.447 --> 13:04.992
because you got the letter
that said you didn't pass a class.

13:05.075 --> 13:07.453
-Right.
-Right? Is it just one class?

13:07.536 --> 13:09.413
Yeah, it's just one class.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.541
So, why haven't you went back in
and gotten that?

13:12.625 --> 13:17.421
Uh, I mean, I talked to the teacher
and the teacher is not having it.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.549
-So, it's the teacher's fault?
-It's the teacher's fault.

13:20.633 --> 13:24.512
I mean, when I say I think,
I believe it's the teacher's fault.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.555
You want it to be the teacher's fault.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.351
No, I had some fault into it, too,
but I would say--

13:30.434 --> 13:32.853
-What fault did you have in that?
-Um...

13:33.395 --> 13:39.652
I didn't-- It's just one day a week class,
and I didn't go to class sometimes.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.737
Hold on, let's just stop there.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.864
This whole thing about
the teacher's fault,

13:43.948 --> 13:46.659
but now we realize,
you didn't go to class.

13:46.742 --> 13:49.411
-Yeah.
-So, whose fault is it?

13:49.995 --> 13:50.871
Uh... [chuckles]

13:51.247 --> 13:53.499
[Karamo] Arian is fully aware
of the lies he's telling,

13:53.582 --> 13:56.210
and he's doing it
because he's trying to protect himself

13:56.293 --> 13:58.712
from what he thinks people expect of him.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.965
He hasn't done the work yet
on himself,

14:01.048 --> 14:03.300
so he can get to a place
where he's comfortable

14:03.384 --> 14:04.927
to tell people his truth.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.805
We have dug through these levels with you.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.641
We can't help you
unless you're truly honest.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.685
You're gonna be having
a housewarming party.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.771
This is a perfect opportunity
to tell your mom the truth.

14:15.854 --> 14:19.108
-I accept some of the fault but...
-Some?

14:19.608 --> 14:21.986
-All.
-I am not gonna change that.

14:22.820 --> 14:27.074
[Karamo] Arian is young, but he needs to
take responsibility for his own life.

14:27.157 --> 14:30.578
You can fool some people some of the time,
but not everybody all the time.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.663
We all have a plan for you now.

14:32.746 --> 14:35.791
-It's time to get to work, fellows.
-You are awesome.

14:38.502 --> 14:43.215
[Antoni] I hope Arian is just open-minded
to live a life of passion and ambition.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.176
I don't see that, but I know it's there.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.554
[Karamo] Arian forgot what truth means.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.640
I want him to understand why
he's been lying,

14:51.724 --> 14:53.726
so that he can move past that.

14:53.809 --> 14:57.855
His look is just not giving me
any indication that he cares.

14:57.938 --> 14:59.982
I wanna create a definite change.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.610
I wanna show everyone
he's not just talking.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.862
He's willing to make a change.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.739
[Tan] He actually has great style.

15:06.822 --> 15:10.075
I've selected a product
that is great for him, youthful,

15:10.159 --> 15:12.077
this will just add
to that closet

15:12.161 --> 15:14.788
and make him feel more
appropriately dressed.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.999
[Bobby] Where you lay your head at night

15:17.082 --> 15:20.544
can set the foundation
for every aspect of your life.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.756
I wanna make sure
that I leave Ari with the importance

15:23.839 --> 15:27.885
of making sure your surroundings are
clean, organized, and happy.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.974
Come on through, mate.
I've got something in store for you

15:34.058 --> 15:37.895
that I think you're gonna love,
and by love, I mean hate,

15:37.978 --> 15:41.732
but it's to benefit you, I promise.
We're gonna work out in this space,

15:41.815 --> 15:44.276
but you're not gonna be able to
do it in jorts,

15:44.360 --> 15:47.154
so, I've brought you clothes
to change into.

15:47.237 --> 15:50.157
-This is gonna be a tough hour.
-I'm ready for it.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.617
Yeah. All right. Good.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.870
It's obvious that Arian takes no pride
in his appearance.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.581
It's time to put in some work.

15:57.665 --> 16:01.335
Everything I give you,
you must do the amount that I tell you.

16:01.418 --> 16:04.630
-No quitting on this one.
-I'm gonna do my best.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.382
-We're gonna get it.
-Great.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.843
-I want you to do quick abs. Take a seat.
-God. Oh, boy.

16:09.927 --> 16:13.305
Really stretch, really stretch,
really stretch. Ah-ah.

16:13.597 --> 16:16.767
-All the way back.
-All the way back? That's hard.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.019
Ari has nice clothes
in his closet,

16:19.103 --> 16:22.231
but he's gained weight
and his clothing doesn't fit.

16:22.314 --> 16:25.818
It's all right.
You got yourself. Don't worry about it.

16:25.901 --> 16:27.778
-You can do it.
-I almost fell.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.363
Get it, get it. Good.

16:30.322 --> 16:34.451
With the exercise I'm giving Ari,
I want him to get rid of the belly.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.453
I want you to clench your bum.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.622
We're gonna make sure
your ass looks tight.

16:38.706 --> 16:42.459
His form has to be tip-top,
otherwise he's not gonna see the benefit.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.962
-Fifteen.
-You said ten.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.214
-Nope.
-You're lying to me.

16:47.297 --> 16:49.049
-I'm allowed to lie. [laughs]
-What?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.844
-So, why can't I lie?
-Mine's a little one.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.471
I wanna see him sweat.
See him struggle.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.724
I wanna see him see something through.

16:56.807 --> 16:59.143
What are you gonna wear
to your party?

16:59.226 --> 17:02.896
I was, like, maybe thinking,
like, some black jeans.

17:02.980 --> 17:08.068
-Okay.
-And maybe, like, a plain white T.

17:08.819 --> 17:12.156
You can step it up more.
Wear a button-up shirt.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.408
It's the first time
people are seeing your home.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.160
-Your mom's coming.
-Right.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.162
What's the point of having all that stuff?

17:18.245 --> 17:20.372
-I sometimes wear them.
-Where to?

17:20.456 --> 17:23.876
-Like, bars, if I'm going out to a club.
-Okay.

17:23.959 --> 17:27.171
-Concerts.
-You're one of the few I've come across

17:27.254 --> 17:29.757
and I'm like, "I like half of this stuff."

17:29.840 --> 17:32.342
If you're not wearing it,
what's the point?

17:32.426 --> 17:34.970
-You don't like all of them?
-Not all of it.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.015
I got rid of some of it.
I'm doing you a favor.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.392
Your wardrobe's gonna be fantastic.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.269
Arian lives a lazy life.

17:42.352 --> 17:45.647
He takes failure as an easy option
every time.

17:45.731 --> 17:49.026
How are you feeling
about talking to your mom this week?

17:49.151 --> 17:50.360
Uh...

17:51.904 --> 17:54.740
I get it,
they're gonna beat the crap out of you.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.992
-However...
-Right.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.120
It's not like you've given up on life.
You're gonna take care of it.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.790
So, you can tell them,
"This is my plan."

18:02.873 --> 18:05.793
-Present the best version of yourself.
-Right.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.795
And then be honest with people.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.672
-Careful, I'm gonna speed this up.
-Bring it on.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.258
We're gonna go fast.
Just for a minute.

18:13.342 --> 18:14.551
I just wanna see it.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.804
You were struggling
with the abs, come on.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.889
could you do this
a couple times a week?

18:18.972 --> 18:20.933
-Most likely, yeah.
-Good. Good.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.606
[Bobby] A lot of boxes outside.

18:27.689 --> 18:32.027
We've got a lot of new stuff inside,
but you're not gonna see any of that.

18:32.111 --> 18:36.824
-[Arian] Then what are we doing here?
-I have got other plans for you.

18:38.700 --> 18:42.538
All right. So, you need to step up
and be a good roommate.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.206
You walk by this every day.

18:44.289 --> 18:48.460
You walk by the dirty grill,
the flowerpots upside down.

18:48.544 --> 18:52.005
Whatever all this is.
And you do nothing about it.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.050
So, today you're gonna
do something about it.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.679
-What am I gonna do?
-You're gonna clean your damn patio.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.013
All right.

19:00.097 --> 19:04.059
I pick this week
to let our guy kind of relax, be pampered.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.979
We do all the work for him.
But not this week.

19:07.062 --> 19:11.275
Clearly, Ari needs to learn
how to respect a shared space.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.237
-Got some flowers there.
-Yeah.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.281
This is what we need right now.

19:17.364 --> 19:20.617
-First, get rid of those cigarette butts.
-Okay.

19:20.701 --> 19:24.121
-'Cause you need to quit smoking.
-Uh, thinking about that.

19:24.204 --> 19:28.292
Sweep all of these corners up here.
Get all that dirt out of the way.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.879
And then we can start spraying it clean.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.547
[Arian] I'm a pretty good sweeper.

19:33.630 --> 19:36.425
It's all about
the way you hold the stick.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.551
[both chuckling]

19:37.634 --> 19:42.055
-Are you trying to be clever?
-I am clever, though.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.975
♪ I'm gonna sweat it
I'm gonna sweat it out ♪

19:47.144 --> 19:48.145
Disgusting.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.648
♪ You've gotta let it
You've gotta let it out ♪

19:55.402 --> 19:58.238
How are you doing over there
with all that grass?

19:58.322 --> 19:59.531
I think I'm done.

19:59.615 --> 20:03.202
I can still see some long blades
growing over there.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.661
Just ignore them.

20:04.745 --> 20:08.707
You know, that seems to be
your theory on life at the moment.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.794
Yeah. True.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.716
Life isn't always about coasting,

20:17.799 --> 20:20.427
and I feel like, right now,
you're coasting.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.888
-Do you think, yeah?
-Just a little bit.

20:23.347 --> 20:26.475
24 is when you're supposed to be
working your ass off.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.770
He needs to take some of that smarts
and apply himself.

20:29.853 --> 20:33.023
We all have shortcomings.
We all make mistakes.

20:33.106 --> 20:36.026
We aren't always in a place
we're happy being.

20:36.109 --> 20:39.780
At the end of the day,
it's not what you say, it's what you do.

20:39.863 --> 20:42.616
Bring in the rest of those pots,
I'll be back.

20:42.699 --> 20:47.871
Stories don't last. Only hard work,
dedication, and responsibility.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.873
That's what takes you far.

20:49.957 --> 20:53.585
Do you feel good at all
for having accomplished anything?

20:53.669 --> 20:57.130
Yeah, totally. I mean, you know,
I mean, look at the sweat.

20:57.214 --> 21:00.342
-This is accomplishment right here, like--
-Exactly.

21:00.425 --> 21:03.178
-Cheers.
-Cheers, too.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.349
[Karamo] Welcome to the Fab 5 loft.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.559
-Nice, right?
-This place is amazing.

21:09.643 --> 21:13.105
-And this right here is my friend Ralph.
-Uh-huh.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.940
-Ralph, this is Ari.
-Nice to meet you.

21:15.023 --> 21:19.319
-Ralph is actually a polygraph examiner.
-Oh, my God. Okay.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.196
-[Karamo] You're gonna sit here.
-Okay.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.949
[Karamo] I love the awkward laugh.
You're nervous. You're scared.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.993
-Just a little bit.
-[Karamo] It's okay.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.537
-Yeah.
-This is all about a clean slate.

21:28.620 --> 21:33.166
There's no more digging myself into a hole
with stories that don't make sense.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.584
-Does that work?
-Yeah.

21:34.668 --> 21:35.752
-Ready?
-Yes, sir.

21:35.836 --> 21:39.548
He is nervous. Who wouldn't be,
if you'd lied as much as he did?

21:39.631 --> 21:42.968
He needs to understand very quickly
that lies catch up.

21:43.051 --> 21:44.720
[Ralph] You'll listen for each question,

21:44.803 --> 21:47.639
and all questions have only two options,
yes or no.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.016
Cool.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.560
[Karamo] These questions
are just to figure out

21:51.643 --> 21:54.354
those inconsistencies
we were feeling yesterday

21:54.438 --> 21:56.231
so that we can truly help you.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.943
Remain still,
the test is about to begin.

22:02.237 --> 22:04.823
-Is your first name Arian?
-Yes.

22:06.074 --> 22:09.202
-Do you live in the state of Georgia?
-Yes.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.665
-Have you paid your rent late?
-[Arian] Yes.

22:14.249 --> 22:18.420
Have you received a verbal
or written warning for being late to work?

22:18.503 --> 22:19.338
Yes.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.506
Did you meet minimum
attendance requirements?

22:21.590 --> 22:22.424
Yes.

22:22.507 --> 22:25.052
...verbally blame someone...?
Been fired...?

22:25.135 --> 22:28.472
Did you ever receive a warning...?
Did you ever lie...?

22:28.555 --> 22:30.807
-...percent of the work?
-No.

22:31.725 --> 22:35.395
Did you ever lie to anyone
about graduating from college?

22:36.104 --> 22:36.980
Um...

22:38.690 --> 22:39.900
Yes.

22:39.983 --> 22:42.069
This part of the test is now over.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.572
-How do you think you did?
-[Arian] Uh...

22:45.655 --> 22:47.824
Pretty good, hopefully. [laughs]

22:47.908 --> 22:49.117
-Hopefully?
-[Arian] Yeah.

22:49.451 --> 22:52.412
You would know how you did.
It's a truth test.

22:52.496 --> 22:53.872
-Yeah.
-Did you tell the truth?

22:53.955 --> 22:55.373
I did, yeah.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.501
-You told the truth?
-Yes, sir.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.377
[Karamo] Let me know
when you have the results?

22:59.461 --> 23:02.506
-It'll be a few minutes.
-Perfect. Come here with me.

23:02.589 --> 23:03.715
-Take a seat.
-Yeah.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.467
So, back up.

23:05.550 --> 23:08.970
Why would you be unsure
about if you told the truth or not?

23:09.054 --> 23:14.518
Um, some of my-- I just feel like
it's a little bit gray-sided

23:14.601 --> 23:17.354
so, it can't be, like, a yes or no answer.

23:17.437 --> 23:19.189
They were yes or no questions--

23:19.272 --> 23:21.817
These questions were designed
so there's no gray.

23:21.900 --> 23:25.487
It's easier to have gray because then
you're softening the blow.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.532
-Right.
-That's why you end up being on the couch,

23:29.199 --> 23:32.202
not doing things,
and making yourself feel bad,

23:32.285 --> 23:36.206
and you're, like, I'd rather not even
have to tell people stories

23:36.289 --> 23:39.751
-than I would just be with myself.
-Right. Very true.

23:39.835 --> 23:40.710
Yeah.

23:40.794 --> 23:44.172
Do you ever feel sick
about your parents finding out

23:44.256 --> 23:46.842
-that you didn't graduate?
-All the time.

23:46.925 --> 23:50.220
They sacrificed a lot
of their own opportunities

23:50.303 --> 23:52.764
for me to have a good, bright future.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.142
I'm the child of an immigrant.
I've heard them say,

23:55.225 --> 23:59.437
"You have everything. You have this.
You better make this opportunity.

23:59.521 --> 24:02.315
We gave up this so that you could do it."

24:02.399 --> 24:04.234
That's a lot of pressure
on a child.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.820
But guess what. This is your journey.

24:06.903 --> 24:08.363
-Right.
-This is your life.

24:08.446 --> 24:09.823
Design it how you want it.

24:09.906 --> 24:12.492
You need to own the fact
you didn't graduate.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.286
Crap's getting real.

24:14.369 --> 24:15.620
That's what we're here for.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.789
What can you do
to go towards your dreams?

24:17.873 --> 24:21.751
Applying myself more,
and I'm gonna take the class again.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.879
Finally, he understands.

24:24.462 --> 24:25.380
Oh, my God.

24:25.463 --> 24:28.425
Circled the questions on which
deception indicated.

24:28.508 --> 24:30.135
Perfect. Thank you so much.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.095
How bad is it, doctor?

24:32.179 --> 24:33.430
[both laughing]

24:37.225 --> 24:39.936
-The results...
-Oh, my god.

24:40.020 --> 24:43.106
...don't mean a thing. You know the lies,
you know the gray areas.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.859
Let go of that pressure.
What I'm trying to do...

24:45.942 --> 24:47.777
-Mm-hm.
-Come on, do this with me.

24:47.861 --> 24:50.322
-Do this with me. Do this with me.
-All right.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.949
Do this. There you go.
Release the pressure.

24:53.033 --> 24:53.909
Okay.

24:54.993 --> 24:59.080
-I didn't graduate. It's good.
-I haven't graduated. It's okay.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.749
-It's good.
-It's all good.

25:00.832 --> 25:03.001
-Things happen.
-Things happen.

25:03.084 --> 25:06.796
-Exactly. Sorry, I didn't graduate.
-Sorry I haven't graduated.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.006
It is what it is.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.883
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

25:15.388 --> 25:18.225
I love this salon.
It's a beautiful cob commoner.

25:18.308 --> 25:21.102
-Uh-huh.
-We're gonna get you really cleaned up.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.104
-Let's do it.
-Yes. Come on in.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.107
Go ahead and jump in
and let's have a chitty chat.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.943
So, JP is an amazing barber,

25:28.026 --> 25:31.446
and I wanted a classic barber
to do a classic barber shape.

25:31.529 --> 25:34.574
So, what I wanna do,
it's called a mid to low fade.

25:34.658 --> 25:38.787
We're gonna take your sides really short,
and leave your length on top,

25:38.870 --> 25:42.415
and then, for your beard,
it's going bye-bye.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.001
-[Arian] We talking about a clean shave?
-Yes.

25:45.085 --> 25:47.837
-Have you ever done that?
-I looked like a kid.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.965
You're gonna look really attractive.

25:50.048 --> 25:54.177
Sometimes showing a new face
can show people that you're serious.

25:54.261 --> 25:57.055
-Let's do it.
-When we have our party,

25:57.138 --> 26:00.141
I want your family to note you're
putting your best face forward.

26:00.225 --> 26:03.270
We can leave moments that are you.
I just wanna clean it up.

26:03.353 --> 26:04.729
-Sounds good.
-Yeah.

26:04.813 --> 26:08.149
When people are having
a problem shifting on the inside,

26:08.233 --> 26:11.152
it helps to shift them on the outside.
When you change your look

26:11.236 --> 26:12.904
and you see yourself
a different way,

26:12.988 --> 26:15.407
it can inspire you
to work a bit harder

26:15.490 --> 26:17.200
because you're feeling yourself.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.703
I know finances are
an issue sometimes,

26:19.786 --> 26:22.706
but if you think,
what does a solid men's haircut cost?

26:22.789 --> 26:24.708
-Let's say $45.
-Right.

26:24.791 --> 26:28.878
That's like a dollar
and ten cents a day for gorgeous hair.

26:28.962 --> 26:31.923
You can't get good tips
if your hair is messed up.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.092
It could pay for itself
by getting a tip.

26:34.175 --> 26:36.052
[Jonathan] It's literally an investment.

26:36.136 --> 26:38.888
I am so excited
to see you without facial hair.

26:38.972 --> 26:41.933
What we're doing now is
a gorgeous pre-shave oil,

26:42.017 --> 26:46.229
and then that hot towel is just
keeping the pre-shave oil in there.

26:46.313 --> 26:48.940
So, does this make the hair less curly?

26:49.024 --> 26:50.567
[Jonathan] It makes the hair stand up,

26:50.650 --> 26:53.695
so when he shaves it,
it gets as close to the skin as possible.

26:53.778 --> 26:54.612
[Arian] Oh, okay.

26:54.696 --> 26:57.866
You need a shave cream
and then a post shave.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.368
-Okay. Is that like aftershave?
-[Jonathan] Yes.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.454
A little bit goes a long way.

27:02.537 --> 27:04.372
-You don't wanna Home Alone it.
-Exactly.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.957
If you do, you went too hard.

27:06.041 --> 27:10.003
All of these steps are paramount
to getting a razor burn-free shave.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.093
-Ready to see the new you?
-Yeah.

27:17.177 --> 27:18.928
-Okay, ready?
-Yeah.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.389
Oh, my God.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.891
-Professional.
-Yeah.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.852
See how you're like
a badass man in his 20s?

27:25.935 --> 27:27.562
-You're not a little boy.
-[Arian] Right.

27:27.645 --> 27:29.022
This is a worldly man.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.233
-I like this part here.
-[JP] The little blend.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.651
-Yeah.
-The skin fade.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.404
-I mean, look at that new smile.
-Yeah.

27:36.488 --> 27:40.158
♪ Keep your head up
Get out of the water ♪

27:40.575 --> 27:43.203
♪ Get your feet back on solid ground ♪

27:43.745 --> 27:46.915
♪ Keep on breathing
You're reaching up higher ♪

27:46.998 --> 27:49.501
♪ Keep your head up and don't look down ♪

27:50.794 --> 27:53.004
-Ari, you look amazing.
-Thank you.

27:53.088 --> 27:58.093
-How do you feel with no beard?
-It feels colder. I can feel my skin.

27:58.176 --> 28:01.262
-So, you're gonna keep your eyes closed.
-[car horn honking]

28:01.346 --> 28:03.223
-[Tan] Guys, they're here.
-I got you.

28:03.306 --> 28:06.601
-All right.
-Take a step, step. Step. Yeah.

28:06.684 --> 28:08.520
Put your glasses on.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.397
-Yes!
-Blind no more.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.024
-Holy crap.
-[all laughing]

28:17.487 --> 28:19.656
-God.
-Look how handsome you look.

28:19.739 --> 28:21.741
-I know, right?
-Oh, my God!

28:21.825 --> 28:23.284
Amazing. It's beautiful.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.370
[Bobby] I've put pots
at the tops of these columns,

28:25.453 --> 28:27.831
it made the space look
larger and taller.

28:27.914 --> 28:29.374
It elongated the space.

28:29.457 --> 28:31.209
It draws your eye up.

28:31.292 --> 28:34.170
There's places out here
for you now to entertain.

28:34.254 --> 28:36.923
When you have apartments,
spaces are smaller,

28:37.006 --> 28:38.925
you wanna utilize
all the space you have.

28:39.008 --> 28:40.885
This was a totally under-utilized space.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.805
I wanted this to be an extension
of your apartment.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.140
Ready to see inside?

28:45.223 --> 28:46.641
-Okay, I'll help.
-Okay.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.811
Come in out of the heat.
Close the door behind him.

28:49.894 --> 28:52.147
-Three, two, one.
-[shouting]

28:57.360 --> 29:00.864
Oh, my God. This is amazing.

29:00.947 --> 29:03.408
-So damn artsy.
-[laughing]

29:03.491 --> 29:06.578
This is the coolest
coffee table situation, ever.

29:06.661 --> 29:07.912
It's like a lamp.

29:07.996 --> 29:10.081
They're functional in so many ways.

29:10.165 --> 29:13.877
They're functional as a coffee table,
but they're also functional as lighting.

29:13.960 --> 29:17.005
-This is your adult bedroom.
-Holy crap.

29:20.633 --> 29:22.761
[Bobby] I did give you
new blackout roller shades.

29:22.844 --> 29:26.473
This is called a hamper.
Where you put your dirty clothes.

29:26.556 --> 29:29.058
-I know you didn't--
-I thought that was a decoration.

29:29.142 --> 29:31.686
-I knew you didn't realize...
-Look, floors.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.063
-You have floors now.
-You had hardwood floors.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.065
How do you feel about the entire house,

29:36.149 --> 29:38.401
and the fact that this is now
your adult space?

29:38.485 --> 29:42.906
Looks amazing. It's almost like
it evolved to something else.

29:42.989 --> 29:46.409
Just like me evolving to something else,
or a new person.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.995
It feels a lot of myself is in the room.

29:49.078 --> 29:50.288
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

29:50.371 --> 29:53.500
-Don't mess up the bedding.
-Break the bed.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.460
[all laughing]

29:55.543 --> 29:58.671
I don't know
how many people this was rated for.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.590
Just enough.

30:00.673 --> 30:04.260
So, you'll be preparing Tadig tonight,
a little housewarming.

30:04.344 --> 30:09.557
Dude, that's my favorite food
from when I was 5 or 6. Tadig.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.768
[Antoni]
It's basically a savory rice cake.

30:11.851 --> 30:14.938
It's like a special occasion dish
in Persian culture.

30:15.021 --> 30:17.816
Have you ever made? Or just had
that your mom prepared?

30:17.899 --> 30:21.611
I've never made it before, just 'cause--
My mom, like, made it--

30:21.694 --> 30:23.363
I'm not judging you!

30:23.446 --> 30:25.615
I'm happy it's something you enjoy.

30:25.698 --> 30:28.409
-Yeah.
-So, we have water that's prepping here.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.370
We're gonna put in a bunch of salt.

30:30.453 --> 30:34.833
For the base over here, we're gonna
basically take any type of potato

30:34.916 --> 30:37.043
and we're cutting super thin slices.

30:37.126 --> 30:40.088
You wanna cut it thin
because if it's too thick,

30:40.171 --> 30:42.423
then it takes longer to cook
and it's not crispy.

30:42.507 --> 30:46.135
By preparing a super traditional dish
with care for his mom,

30:46.219 --> 30:50.348
I'm hoping that at least her reaction
ignites something in him.

30:50.431 --> 30:54.978
Now you're gonna line the bottom of this
with these slices of potato.

30:55.061 --> 30:58.231
Put them in so they look pretty.
We take some saffron.

30:58.314 --> 31:02.735
You know what my mama does?
She puts the dried saffron just like that

31:02.819 --> 31:05.655
and adds hot water, this much hot water.

31:05.738 --> 31:08.366
That's exactly
what we're gonna do, actually.

31:08.449 --> 31:10.118
-I know some things.
-Yeah.

31:10.201 --> 31:14.539
So, we're gonna take this water
from the rice and take a ladle,

31:14.622 --> 31:16.958
take the hot water and throw it in here

31:17.041 --> 31:21.129
and already it just turns this, like,
beautiful golden color.

31:21.212 --> 31:25.383
Now take some Greek yogurt.
Two, like, super heaping tablespoons.

31:25.466 --> 31:27.719
-So, we just mix in the yogurt and--
-Salt it up.

31:27.802 --> 31:30.722
We're ready for assembly.
Should be some safflower oil,

31:30.805 --> 31:34.517
in that bottle.
Just two or three tablespoons.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.103
A good tip is
you put your thumb over it.

31:37.186 --> 31:40.607
And then you're able to control
where you put the oil.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.609
You take this base over here.

31:42.692 --> 31:45.778
-Okay. It looks so cool.
-Uh-huh.

31:45.862 --> 31:49.157
-Take that spoon and even it out nicely.
-You've got it.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.743
And the rest of the rice goes on top here.

31:52.118 --> 31:54.495
Now, there's gonna be
a lot of moisture at the base

31:54.579 --> 31:56.039
so, we want the steam
to come up,

31:56.122 --> 31:58.917
so, using a spoon or a knife,
we can just

31:59.250 --> 32:01.294
-create a couple of holes here.
-That's why.

32:01.377 --> 32:03.713
My mama does that, too,
I'm, like, why?

32:03.796 --> 32:04.923
-[Antoni] She does?
-Yeah.

32:05.006 --> 32:06.382
That makes me so happy.

32:06.466 --> 32:09.844
And then you take
little bits of butter into those holes

32:09.928 --> 32:12.180
so they're gonna go down.
We're gonna put this in.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.265
Position it on the lowest rack

32:14.349 --> 32:16.476
so you have the direct heat
coming up

32:16.559 --> 32:18.895
and it cooks the potatoes,
the rice is already done.

32:18.978 --> 32:22.440
But you need the potatoes to cook
and be crispy and brown.

32:22.523 --> 32:28.446
And then, when it comes out,
it's gonna look something like this.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.699
-Like a rice pot.
-Like a rice pot.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.868
-And then, for this part.
-Okay.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.162
And it's actually safe to...

32:37.538 --> 32:38.373
All right.

32:40.166 --> 32:42.043
Hopefully I did it right.

32:43.169 --> 32:46.255
All right. Boom. That was amazing.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.342
What I wanna do,
because budget is an issue.

32:49.425 --> 32:52.387
There's a lot of natural things
you can get from the grocery store

32:52.470 --> 32:55.640
that are amazing tips and tricks.
Agave nectar.

32:55.723 --> 32:59.394
If you rub it all over your face,
you use way too much product.

32:59.477 --> 33:02.063
I always apply stuff
to the back of my hand.

33:02.146 --> 33:05.525
You go like this instead of
wiping it all over your hands,

33:05.608 --> 33:10.113
so you have a more controlled amount,
and you just rub it into your skin.

33:10.196 --> 33:12.865
If you're as broke as a joke,
little baby boy,

33:12.949 --> 33:16.202
there's no excuse for you to not have
some face wash, the basics.

33:16.285 --> 33:18.871
We just take it off with water,
you don't have to wash it.

33:18.955 --> 33:21.082
-Leave it on for a minute?
-No, 15.

33:21.165 --> 33:24.419
There is a budget line for everyone.
You have to do a bit of research.

33:24.502 --> 33:27.296
You do not have to
wash your hair every day.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.216
I would discourage you
washing it every day.

33:30.299 --> 33:31.384
It can dry it out.

33:31.467 --> 33:34.303
When you come out of the shower,
and it's frizzy,

33:34.387 --> 33:37.056
this is how you would re-zhoosh it.
You take your brush,

33:37.140 --> 33:40.852
you're gonna use the round brush
to blow the hair back.

33:40.935 --> 33:43.646
See I'm grabbing it like that
and pulling it.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.399
-Yeah.
-So, you're just using the tension

33:46.691 --> 33:48.026
to pull the hair back.

33:48.109 --> 33:53.114
So, start in the front, pull,
feel one more section behind it, pull.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.657
-See how I'm doing that?
-Yeah.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.701
Just work your way
to the back of the head.

33:56.784 --> 33:59.996
So, that last chapter of your life
that you said you're moving out of.

34:00.079 --> 34:03.249
-Yeah.
-You told me that you felt overwhelmed.

34:03.332 --> 34:09.338
Oh, yeah. It's a big move not depending
on my parents or my family or my friends.

34:09.714 --> 34:12.717
I think I'm ready
to just come clean with them,

34:12.800 --> 34:15.386
and just be, like,
"I know you all worry,

34:15.470 --> 34:17.430
you all have expectations of me,

34:17.513 --> 34:19.348
but letting you know,
it's gonna be okay.

34:19.432 --> 34:20.767
I'm gonna be okay."

34:20.850 --> 34:24.145
We all moved here from a different country
with a totally different culture

34:24.228 --> 34:27.857
-Mm-hm.
-and most of it is for my sister and I,

34:27.940 --> 34:30.610
for us to go to school,
get our life together.

34:30.693 --> 34:33.362
-Yeah.
-And becoming someone they're proud of.

34:33.446 --> 34:37.867
And if they'd notice that,
"this dude didn't graduate from college,"

34:37.950 --> 34:41.454
it's just gonna hit them kind of hard
in the heart, you know.

34:42.538 --> 34:45.917
I'm so proud of you
that you're at the place now

34:46.000 --> 34:47.835
you're ready to be honest
with your mom.

34:47.919 --> 34:50.505
How is she gonna know
that you have a plan?

34:50.588 --> 34:53.049
I'll have something ready for her,
to tell her.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.425
Ready to see some clothes.

34:54.509 --> 34:59.597
T-shirts, short-sleeved shirts,
full button-up shirts, long-sleeve shirts.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.892
I've then moved over
to jeans and suits and jackets,

35:02.975 --> 35:06.062
so, keep it organized, and it's easier
to get ready.

35:06.145 --> 35:07.688
T-shirts don't have to be ratty.

35:07.772 --> 35:10.233
Wear something that has
a lot more interest to it,

35:10.316 --> 35:13.986
that looks like you've made an effort,
so, go for a T-shirt with detail.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.738
I wanted to get you some print.

35:15.822 --> 35:19.242
Feel free to wear something with a collar,
don't wear a T-shirt tonight.

35:19.325 --> 35:21.911
So, make it a polo, make it that polo,
something simple

35:21.994 --> 35:25.164
that looks like you've made an effort.

35:25.248 --> 35:28.543
Yeah? Okay, I love a good boot
and I love--

35:28.626 --> 35:30.086
-Those are nice.
-Aren't they?

35:30.169 --> 35:32.922
I love a good desert boot.
You can wear these in the daytime

35:33.005 --> 35:35.258
but it feels as good as a sneaker.

35:35.341 --> 35:39.178
If all I did was keep this, keep this,
and just change those to these,

35:39.262 --> 35:42.849
I promise you you'll look stepped up.
Okay, so, I wanna get you in some stuff.

35:42.932 --> 35:44.433
-Are you ready to try on?
-Yeah.

35:44.517 --> 35:45.601
Okay.

35:45.685 --> 35:48.020
Turn towards me,
and then undo that to your lips.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.397
Okay, boys, ready?

35:50.940 --> 35:52.024
[Fab 5] Yes.

35:52.108 --> 35:54.068
Come on out. Come on out.

35:54.402 --> 35:55.862
[all shouting]

35:57.697 --> 35:59.991
-Nice.
-That's a great jacket.

36:00.074 --> 36:03.786
-Look, look how good--
-How amazing you look.

36:03.870 --> 36:05.246
[Bobby] You're adulting!

36:05.329 --> 36:08.082
I love a bomber jacket,
and that looks amazing.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.543
Even though it's casual,
it's still presentable.

36:10.626 --> 36:13.588
If it was a casual job,
he could wear this to an interview.

36:13.671 --> 36:16.799
They wanna see you have made
an effort, but are not wearing a suit,

36:16.883 --> 36:19.385
you just look cool, approachable,
like a grown man.

36:19.468 --> 36:22.305
-How do you feel in it?
-I feel like a baller.

36:22.388 --> 36:24.432
[all laughing]

36:24.515 --> 36:25.766
[Jonathan] See the difference?

36:25.850 --> 36:28.769
If you rolled out of the house
in this versus gym wear,

36:28.853 --> 36:30.855
like, how that might make you
feel different?

36:30.938 --> 36:32.231
Yeah. Totally, yeah.

36:32.315 --> 36:33.983
He's giving you confidence.

36:34.066 --> 36:36.944
Can you handle the confidence?
I don't think you can.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.363
[Karamo]
How have you been feeling about this week?

36:39.447 --> 36:42.408
Pretty much just-- It's been a ride.

36:42.491 --> 36:46.037
I just met five really cool people
who have good intentions

36:46.120 --> 36:47.747
and they know what they're doing,

36:47.830 --> 36:52.251
and they actually help people
who might need helping and...

36:52.335 --> 36:53.502
Aw, buddy.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.046
[all laughing]

36:56.005 --> 36:58.216
We feel love, we do.

36:58.299 --> 37:01.552
You've brought me back to remembering
what it felt like to be 24,

37:01.636 --> 37:06.098
and having those fears and worries
of am I doing it right,

37:06.182 --> 37:09.518
am I doing enough,
am I gonna make people proud,

37:09.602 --> 37:13.356
and sometimes, when you feel those things,
you start to say things

37:13.439 --> 37:17.026
to cover up that you don't feel
like you are where you're supposed to be.

37:17.109 --> 37:18.945
-Right.
-And I know you're headed

37:19.028 --> 37:21.364
in the right direction in life
and I'm proud of you.

37:21.447 --> 37:22.323
Thank you.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.825
I know we came in
hard on you at first,

37:24.909 --> 37:26.869
we've been there,
trying to find our way.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.537
Things don't always go as planned,

37:28.621 --> 37:30.957
but you just gotta get back up
on the horse.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.918
[Arian] Everything takes steps
for it to become something bigger.

37:34.001 --> 37:36.754
Just shows that you've gotta
put in the work and the love

37:36.837 --> 37:39.257
and the time to make something better.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.800
I had to go through that

37:40.883 --> 37:45.179
so I can, you know,
open the next chapter of the Ari book.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.223
-I'm dying to read that chapter.
-Yeah.

37:47.306 --> 37:49.517
[Tan] This is where we leave you.

37:52.561 --> 37:54.063
-Love you.
-Have fun.

37:54.146 --> 37:56.023
-Thanks, man. Thank you.
-Bye, Ari.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.149
I love you, Ari.

37:57.233 --> 37:59.944
Good luck for tonight,
you're gonna kill it.

38:00.027 --> 38:02.238
Ari, like, bathroom now.
Clip nails. Wash.

38:02.321 --> 38:04.198
This is me watching your nails.
Okay, bye.

38:11.914 --> 38:13.499
I'm really grossed out
with you four

38:13.582 --> 38:16.919
'cause you're all so attractive,
and you look so cute in your four suits.

38:17.003 --> 38:20.756
-I'm not in a suit.
-You're in a Matrix suit.

38:20.840 --> 38:21.841
-[Tan] Yeah.
-Yeah.

38:21.924 --> 38:24.593
-[Tan] Are we ready?
-Jonathan, you look so comfy.

38:24.677 --> 38:27.680
I am, I'm just this really cuddly,
cozy, booby baby.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.683
Ooh, spill it all over the place.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.019
-Let's watch.
-[laughs]

38:33.811 --> 38:36.939
He honestly looked so cute with no beard.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.066
Yeah, it was so much better.

38:41.444 --> 38:44.822
-His hair looks so good, so good.
-Thank you.

38:44.905 --> 38:46.365
Massive improvement.

38:47.616 --> 38:50.286
-[Karamo] He's going right for the nails.
-Thank God.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.083
-That polka dot shirt is cute.
-I know.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.753
-I suggested he wear the polka dot.
-[Karamo] Did you really?

38:58.836 --> 39:01.547
-I'm hoping he does.
-[Karamo] I didn't even know that.

39:01.630 --> 39:02.798
[Tan] Uh-huh. Um...

39:03.799 --> 39:07.470
I really wanna focus on this one moment.

39:07.553 --> 39:10.514
No, go for something else.
Please don't wear that.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.768
-I feel like it's...
-No, that's daring.

39:13.851 --> 39:17.021
-That's a look.
-[Antoni] That's a choice you're making.

39:17.104 --> 39:19.190
-That looks a mess.
-A hot mess.

39:19.273 --> 39:22.443
[Tan] I made it really clear,
go for something super simple

39:22.526 --> 39:26.489
and there was a lovely polo in there,
that polka dot one he liked.

39:26.572 --> 39:29.116
He hasn't even adjusted it.
He looks sloppy.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.411
But he cares about fashion.
Is he just stressed?

39:32.495 --> 39:34.747
-He has to be.
-When you see a girl on the beam

39:34.830 --> 39:38.376
in the Olympics, on her first go out
and she falls, you're like, "Damn."

39:38.459 --> 39:40.586
I was rooting for you, you know.

39:40.669 --> 39:43.714
-[Antoni] Oh, look at the napkin trick.
-Cute.

39:43.798 --> 39:44.715
What is that?

39:44.799 --> 39:48.969
You just, like, do this with your fist
so it's easier to lift them.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.805
He looks like such a grown man.

39:50.888 --> 39:55.935
Guys, I'm surprised by how confident he is
and comfortable in the kitchen.

39:56.018 --> 39:58.979
He was acting like
a bit of a dum-dum when we met

39:59.063 --> 40:00.773
and now he knows
what he's doing.

40:00.856 --> 40:04.485
-I think he was just bull-crapping you.
-Yeah, I think so, too.

40:05.778 --> 40:06.654
Whoa, whoa!

40:06.737 --> 40:08.906
Knife tricks. Knife tricks.

40:08.989 --> 40:11.325
He chopped those potatoes beautifully.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.619
He obviously knows
what he's doing.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.204
-Well done.
-[Antoni] Perfect.

40:15.287 --> 40:19.542
He put little nubs of butter on the rice
so that it gets browned on top.

40:19.625 --> 40:23.045
They've cleaned it. It looks so great.

40:23.129 --> 40:26.215
-I like this. Look at here.
-It's, like, so much cleaner.

40:26.298 --> 40:30.052
-That has to be Mom.
-Please let this go good tonight.

40:30.136 --> 40:32.263
-I kind of feel like it will.
-It has to.

40:32.346 --> 40:35.349
-Oh, my God.
-Holy crap.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.393
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my goodness.

40:37.476 --> 40:39.645
-Oh, my God.
-What's up, brov?

40:39.728 --> 40:41.230
Who are you?

40:41.313 --> 40:44.191
-I like the outfit now.
-I hate it.

40:44.275 --> 40:48.320
See, it started growing on me, too.
He's 24. You're allowed to be adventurous.

40:48.404 --> 40:49.530
[Karamo] It's growing on me.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.366
-What's up?
-Look at you.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.244
You look so handsome. [laughing]

40:56.203 --> 40:58.664
-This is so nice.
-Appreciate it, brov.

40:58.747 --> 41:00.416
Everything is so much different.

41:00.499 --> 41:03.127
Outfit, we can debate it all night,
but look how he looks.

41:03.210 --> 41:05.045
He's serving drinks.
House looks amazing.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.672
He's being a proper host.

41:06.755 --> 41:08.799
He was eating sunflower seeds
when we came in.

41:08.883 --> 41:10.593
This is like day and night.

41:10.676 --> 41:12.887
Mom, do you want me to show you
some pictures?

41:12.970 --> 41:15.473
-Sure, I'd love that. Let's go.
-Yeah.

41:15.556 --> 41:17.600
[Arian] It's gonna be a mama moment.

41:18.559 --> 41:21.353
So, Mom, just wanna say,
I love you and all.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.230
I am proud of you.

41:23.314 --> 41:26.108
I know what you want in life,
you're gonna get.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.610
-Yeah.
-I'm sure.

41:27.693 --> 41:30.571
I gotta be responsible,
make better decisions.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.198
Only things.

41:32.281 --> 41:34.325
If I did something wrong,
I gotta admit it.

41:34.408 --> 41:38.954
So, when I was moving, last time I saw you
I showed you this picture.

41:39.038 --> 41:42.541
Okay, here's the time, dear.
Let's tell Mommy.

41:42.625 --> 41:45.085
This one. Yeah.

41:45.544 --> 41:47.922
-[Parvin] This is one of the best.
-Yeah.

41:48.005 --> 41:53.010
So, uh, I just wanted to say something.
So...

41:56.931 --> 41:57.890
Uh...

41:58.516 --> 42:01.769
I haven't graduated yet.
I failed one of my classes.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.858
-How?
-It's a little bit complicated.

42:07.942 --> 42:12.947
I'm still talking to the school,
but, ultimately speaking,

42:13.030 --> 42:15.741
I have to take it next semester,
in January.

42:15.824 --> 42:21.664
-Mm-hm.
-And I know it's terrible. It sucks.

42:21.747 --> 42:24.708
I'm gonna take the class
and I'm gonna go to class

42:24.792 --> 42:28.212
and I'm gonna do the work,
I'm not gonna whine.

42:28.295 --> 42:31.966
Next year, by this time,
I'll have my diploma.

42:32.049 --> 42:37.012
Uh, you know, a lot of it is from me,
why it happened,

42:37.096 --> 42:40.474
and I just wasn't going to class
as much as I should have,

42:40.558 --> 42:43.310
but I'm not gonna do that again,
you know?

42:44.186 --> 42:46.438
-Okay.
-And I'm sorry, okay?

42:47.940 --> 42:49.441
I'm sorry to hear that.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.610
Oh!

42:51.694 --> 42:54.989
-Okay.
-She wanted to punch him in the head.

42:55.072 --> 42:57.324
If this camera wasn't here, boy.

42:57.408 --> 43:01.245
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-Yeah. It felt terrible, you know.

43:02.162 --> 43:03.330
Yeah.

43:08.544 --> 43:11.005
You know, I believe in you.

43:11.088 --> 43:14.425
You can do it. You know me.
I believe it.

43:15.217 --> 43:21.265
And, uh... just is a bad mistake.

43:21.348 --> 43:23.267
-Yeah.
-Bad mistake.

43:23.976 --> 43:26.770
-Yeah.
-Okay, just make-- Make it right.

43:26.854 --> 43:29.356
I just didn't want you
to look at a picture like this

43:29.440 --> 43:33.777
and be all happy, but knowing
that it's not really true, you know?

43:33.861 --> 43:36.822
-No, I'm happy, I'm still happy.
-Yeah.

43:36.905 --> 43:40.868
-Because I know inside of you.
-Yeah.

43:41.201 --> 43:42.703
I know inside of you.

43:43.412 --> 43:47.958
I know just take a little bit longer.

43:48.042 --> 43:49.918
-Yeah.
-I know you can do it.

43:50.002 --> 43:52.630
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Just focus on the future. Okay?

43:55.257 --> 43:57.593
-I love you so much.
-Love you, too.

43:57.676 --> 44:00.262
-Sweet mom.
-She's over it a little.

44:00.346 --> 44:03.599
-I knew she would come around.
-I love this picture.

44:03.682 --> 44:05.225
It's a good picture.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.479
-Ah.
-She loves her son.

44:08.562 --> 44:09.897
Yeah, absolutely.

44:09.980 --> 44:11.273
-How's it going?
-Hi.

44:11.357 --> 44:13.901
Good to see you, too. What's up, bro?

44:13.984 --> 44:17.237
[Jonathan] I love that old gay man
in a little bowler hat.

44:17.321 --> 44:20.032
Maybe he just loves colorful ties.
We don't know he's gay.

44:20.115 --> 44:22.868
-Or he might work for Southwest Airlines.
-I love him.

44:22.951 --> 44:24.703
-Is this you?
-I think so.

44:24.787 --> 44:25.954
It's not like...

44:26.038 --> 44:28.832
That guy in the white shirt's
checking him out.

44:28.916 --> 44:30.250
[all laughing]

44:31.126 --> 44:34.963
So, I think the food might be
ready in a couple of minutes.

44:35.047 --> 44:36.090
I can't wait.

44:38.926 --> 44:42.471
Right now, I feel like
the pressure is not gone.

44:42.554 --> 44:44.932
It's just going forward
making the right decisions

44:45.015 --> 44:48.185
and being truthful
and taking care of things.

44:48.268 --> 44:50.646
I'm surprised that you
pulled this all together.

44:50.729 --> 44:52.356
-We're proud of you.
-Thanks, bro.

44:52.439 --> 44:54.358
Everything's turned out wonderful today.

44:54.441 --> 44:57.653
Thank you for coming and
have a good time, get some good food.

44:57.736 --> 44:59.071
-Okay.
-Yeah.

44:59.154 --> 45:01.824
Being adult means
being a person of action.

45:01.907 --> 45:04.660
It's just what it is,
and it sucks sometimes,

45:04.743 --> 45:07.913
but when you make your plan
and go after that plan, you'll succeed.

45:07.996 --> 45:11.083
I'm seeing a man who's willing to fess up
to what he's done.

45:11.166 --> 45:15.671
It's hard to make up for the mistakes,
but you can make up for it.

45:15.754 --> 45:17.589
It will sort itself out.

45:17.673 --> 45:20.801
You are strong, you're a
Kelly Clarkson song, you've got this.

45:20.884 --> 45:22.803
Kudos, Arian. I'm proud of you.

45:22.886 --> 45:24.888
-How's the food? Is it good?
-Yummy.

45:24.972 --> 45:26.348
Thank you.

45:26.432 --> 45:29.435
-Let's cheers to Arian owning it.
-To Arian.

45:30.394 --> 45:32.229
-Yeah!
-Well done, boys.

45:40.946 --> 45:43.991
Wanna quit smoking?
Tweet instead of lighting up.

45:44.074 --> 45:48.245
Worked for my dad, and tweeting is
a much better vice than this.
