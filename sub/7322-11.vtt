WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:03.174
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:03.174 --> 00:04.635
(Mark) I HAVE
AN 18-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

00:04.635 --> 00:07.108
I'M HAVING A BABY, AND, UM, I
DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO.

00:07.108 --> 00:10.041
DR. BAILEY,
HAVE YOU SEEN THE CHIEF?

00:10.041 --> 00:12.043
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH
HIS EMERGENCY CHOLE PATIENT.
(Miranda) YOU MAY HAVE

00:12.043 --> 00:14.045
ACCIDENTALLY CLIPPED
THE COMMON BILE DUCT.

00:14.045 --> 00:16.047
THAT'S ONE OF
THE MOST SERIOUS MISTAKES

00:16.047 --> 00:17.588
A GENERAL SURGEON CAN MAKE.

00:17.588 --> 00:20.020
(Richard) HAVE YOU TOLD ANYONE
WHAT YOU SAW?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.093
HAVE YOU TOLD DEREK? UM...

00:22.093 --> 00:23.694
NO.

00:23.694 --> 00:25.696
I HAVE LOVED YOU FOREVER.

00:25.696 --> 00:29.430
(Owen) I'M IN LOVE
WITH CRISTINA.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.262
(projector clicking)

00:31.262 --> 00:35.166
(Meredith) WE ASSUME THE REALLY
SERIOUS CHANGES IN OUR LIVES

00:35.166 --> 00:37.138
HAPPEN SLOWLY...

00:37.138 --> 00:39.470
OVER TIME.

00:39.470 --> 00:41.812
BUT IT'S NOT TRUE.

00:41.812 --> 00:46.147
THE BIG STUFF HAPPENS
IN AN INSTANT.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.448
(water running)

00:47.448 --> 00:49.650
(object clatters)

00:49.650 --> 00:51.152
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.624
YEAH, I WANT TO, UH,
GET SOME STUFF DONE

00:53.624 --> 00:55.826
SO THAT I CAN MEET THE CHIEF
THIS AFTERNOON.

00:55.826 --> 00:59.190
HE'S GONNA SHOW ME
ANOTHER OLD SURGERY TAPE.
AGAIN? EVERY NIGHT
THIS WEEK.

00:59.190 --> 01:01.432
I THOUGHT LAST NIGHT
WAS THE LAST TIME.

01:01.432 --> 01:03.434
HE GOT HELD UP.
HE COULDN'T MAKE IT.

01:03.434 --> 01:05.796
YEAH, I WENT BY HIS OFFICE
ON MY WAY OUT.

01:05.796 --> 01:07.798
HE WAS SOUND ASLEEP
ON HIS COUCH.

01:07.798 --> 01:11.472
UH, WHICH IS WHY
HE COULDN'T MAKE IT.

01:11.472 --> 01:14.475
I THINK MAYBE HE JUST
DOESN'T SLEEP WELL AT HOME

01:14.475 --> 01:17.748
WITH ADELE GONE.

01:17.748 --> 01:19.580
MM.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.612
(keys jangle)

01:21.612 --> 01:23.314
(woman) ♪ ...TO ♪

01:23.314 --> 01:27.158
♪ AND I WANT
ANOTHER PERSON WHO... ♪

01:27.158 --> 01:29.190
(giggles)

01:29.190 --> 01:31.362
I NEED SOMETHING
FROM YOU.

01:31.362 --> 01:33.424
MM.

01:33.424 --> 01:36.167
WELL... THAT, TOO.

01:36.167 --> 01:37.468
YEAH?

01:37.468 --> 01:39.770
I NEED YOU TO GIVE SLOAN
AN ULTRASOUND TODAY.

01:39.770 --> 01:41.772
IT'S BEEN
ALMOST THREE WEEKS.

01:41.772 --> 01:43.774
CAN'T SOMEONE FROM O.B.
DO IT?

01:43.774 --> 01:45.736
WELL, YEAH,

01:45.736 --> 01:47.708
BUT...

01:47.708 --> 01:50.311
SHE LIKES YOU.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.112
ALL THE SLOANS DO.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.545
(laughs)

01:54.545 --> 01:57.117
HEY, DO WE HAVE ANY MORE--
OH! EW!

01:57.117 --> 01:58.719
WHOA.
SLOAN!

01:58.719 --> 02:00.891
WHOA.
BECOMING AN ADULT,

02:00.891 --> 02:04.355
BECOMING A PARENT,
BECOMING A DOCTOR--

02:04.355 --> 02:06.857
ONE MINUTE YOU'RE NOT,
AND THE NEXT...

02:06.857 --> 02:08.229
SLOAN.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.530
YOU ARE.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.232
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.534
WHATEVER.
THERE'S NO MORE CEREAL.
WHY ARE YOU SORRY?

02:13.534 --> 02:16.167
SHE'S THE ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOCK
BEFORE SHE CAME IN.

02:16.167 --> 02:18.839
I'LL GET SOME CEREAL
THIS AFTERNOON.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.172
HOW ABOUT SOME JUICE?

02:21.172 --> 02:23.274
UH, LEXIE'S GONNA GIVE YOU
AN ULTRASOUND TODAY.

02:23.274 --> 02:25.846
WHY DON'T YOU PICK UP
SOME BREAKFAST AT THE HOSPITAL?

02:25.846 --> 02:29.149
IT'S GONNA BE MORE.
YOU NEED SOME
FOR LUNCH, TOO?

02:29.149 --> 02:31.622
YEAH, YEAH.

02:31.622 --> 02:34.225
I'M GONNA SHOWER.
OH, CAN YOU
HOLD ON A MINUTE?

02:34.225 --> 02:37.188
I'M PROBABLY
GONNA HAVE TO HURL THIS.

02:37.188 --> 02:41.192
(water running)

02:41.192 --> 02:43.194
SLOAN SLOAN MONOPOLIZING
YOUR BATHROOM AGAIN?

02:43.194 --> 02:44.735
YEAH. YOURS?

02:44.735 --> 02:46.837
OWEN'S IN MINE.

02:46.837 --> 02:48.239
(sighs)

02:48.239 --> 02:49.740
(shower running)
OH!

02:49.740 --> 02:51.942
OH, GOD.

02:51.942 --> 02:54.745
THEY'RE IN THERE.

02:54.745 --> 02:57.578
YEAH, YOU SHOULD
KNOCK FIRST.
I'M LATE.
OKAY? MY HAIR IS DIRTY.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.581
AND HE JUST GAVE HER 80 BUCKS
FOR A MUFFIN AND A SANDWICH.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.953
THAT'S QUITE A SANDWICH.
SHE'S JUST GONNA
END UP SPENDING IT

03:02.953 --> 03:05.916
ON A PAIR OF JEANS
THAT SHOW OFF HER BUTT CRACK,

03:05.916 --> 03:09.220
AND THEN SHE'S GONNA ASK ME
FOR HALF OF MY PASTA SALAD.
YOU SOUND LIKE MY MOTHER.

03:09.220 --> 03:12.763
UM, KNOCK MUCH?
I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.

03:12.763 --> 03:14.895
OH, THERE'S NO MORE
HOT WATER.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.597
(liquid pours)

03:16.597 --> 03:19.770
(whimpers)

03:19.770 --> 03:22.273
ASK ANY DOCTOR,
AND THEY CAN POINT

03:22.273 --> 03:26.477
TO THE ONE MOMENT
THEY BECAME A PHYSICIAN.

03:26.477 --> 03:28.909
IT USUALLY ISN'T MED SCHOOL
GRADUATION DAY.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.881
YANG...
YOU'RE GOING SOLO TODAY.

03:30.881 --> 03:32.943
UH, BEEN THERE.
CARDIO SOLO.

03:32.943 --> 03:35.886
WHATEVER IT IS...
VALVE REPLACEMENT.

03:35.886 --> 03:37.918
NOBODY FORGETS IT.
UH, PORCINE OR...

03:37.918 --> 03:41.392
MECHANICAL.
SO I CAN TRY OUT
THE SUBANNULAR STITCHES.

03:41.392 --> 03:44.295
WELL, I DIDN'T TEACH IT TO YOU
SO YOU COULD CROCHET.

03:44.295 --> 03:46.226
OKAY, THANK YOU.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.228
OH, MY GOD.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.930
(laughs)
(Owen) WHAT? WHAT?

03:49.930 --> 03:52.933
UH...
ALTMAN'S LETTING HER
GO SOLO ON A VALVE.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.905
WOW. UH, YOU FEEL READY?

03:54.905 --> 03:57.638
SHE'S READY.
SHE JUST NEEDS TO BREATHE.

03:57.638 --> 03:58.939
I AM BREATHING.

03:58.939 --> 04:02.943
I AM A LIVING, BREATHING
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEON

04:02.943 --> 04:04.975
AS OF RIGHT NOW.

04:04.975 --> 04:08.018
I HAVE TO GO PREP.
(laughs)

04:08.018 --> 04:10.351
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
ANYTHING'S CHANGED.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.353
YOU THINK YOU'RE STILL YOU

04:12.353 --> 04:14.685
AND YOUR LIFE
IS STILL YOUR LIFE,

04:14.685 --> 04:16.987
BUT YOU WAKE UP ONE DAY
AND LOOK AROUND,

04:16.987 --> 04:18.989
AND YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE
ANYTHING...

04:18.989 --> 04:21.462
NOT ANYTHING AT ALL.

04:25.035 --> 04:27.037
HEY, UM,
DO YOU HAVE ANY CASH?

04:27.037 --> 04:30.501
I LOST THE HEADSET
TO MY PHONE.
HOW ABOUT YOU HOLD THE PHONE
UP TO YOUR EAR?

04:30.501 --> 04:32.503
YOU WERE THE ONE THAT WAS
BITCHING AT ME LAST NIGHT

04:32.503 --> 04:34.575
FOR BEING ON THE PHONE
SO LATE.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.577
MAYBE IF I HAD A HEADSET,

04:36.577 --> 04:39.750
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO TALK
SO LOUD.
MAYBE IF YOU HAD
YOUR OWN APARTMENT,

04:39.750 --> 04:41.752
YOU COULD TALK
WHENEVER YOU WANT,

04:41.752 --> 04:43.384
BUT WE'RE ALL MAKING
COMPROMISES.

04:43.384 --> 04:46.016
OKAY, HERE'S THE HEAD.
(chuckles) IT LOOKS LIKE
AN ALIEN.

04:46.016 --> 04:48.659
WELL, IT'S GONNA BE
A VERY CUTE ALIEN.

04:48.659 --> 04:51.392
A BOY ALIEN OR GIRL?

04:51.392 --> 04:53.994
DUDE, DOES IT HAVE A THING
OR NOT?

04:53.994 --> 04:55.966
NO, I'M NOT LOOKING
AT THE SEX.

04:55.966 --> 04:57.798
UM, I DON'T...

05:00.300 --> 05:03.303
YOU... I--I'M NEW AT THIS.
I'M--I'M NOT VERY GOOD.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.607
SO, UM, WHY DON'T WE GO
UPSTAIRS TO--

05:06.607 --> 05:08.609
THERE'S A BETTER MACHINE
UPSTAIRS.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.941
UH, MAYBE WE'LL HAVE
SOMEONE ELSE TAKE A LOOK.

05:10.941 --> 05:12.643
ADAMSON, YOU'RE WITH ME.

05:12.643 --> 05:14.945
MEREDITH, YOU'RE WITH BAILEY.
KAREV, YOU'RE WITH TORRES.

05:14.945 --> 05:16.887
TOM KATES
IS IN THIS AMBULANCE.

05:16.887 --> 05:19.089
THE QUARTERBACK?
YEAH.

05:19.089 --> 05:21.622
IF YOU SEE PHOTOGRAPHERS,
CALL SECURITY.
TELL YOUR INTERNS
NO AUTOGRAPHS, NO PICTURES.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.454
I SEE ANYONE PULL OUT
A CAMERA PHONE,

05:23.454 --> 05:26.056
IT'S GOING IN THE TOILET.
SO THERE ARE THREE OF US
ON ONE PATIENT?

05:26.056 --> 05:30.000
OH, COME ON.
HE'S A HIGH-PROFILE PATIENT.
HE GETS A LOT OF ATTENTION.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.934
I THOUGHT WE AGREED
TO STOP MEETING LIKE THIS?
HEY, WHAT CAN I SAY, MAN?
I MISSED YOUR SMILING FACE.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.507
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HEAD TRAUMA, BUT G.C.S. 15
SINCE REGAINING CONSCIOUSNESS.

05:36.507 --> 05:39.069
HE GOT HIGH/LOWED BY A COUPLE
OF THEIR LINEBACKERS.

05:39.069 --> 05:41.612
DROPPED LIKE A ROCK.

05:41.612 --> 05:43.614
OKAY, GET X-RAY IN HERE
FOR A TRAUMA SERIES.

05:43.614 --> 05:45.946
(Meredith) TENDERNESS IN
THE UPPER LEFT QUADRANT.
I'M GONNA NEED A C.T.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.078
GOT IT.
OH, THERE'S PAIN
AND CREPITANCE IN THE KNEE.

05:48.078 --> 05:51.051
UH, GET AN X-RAY OF THE LEFT
KNEE WITH THE TRAUMA SERIES.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.753
(Reed) YEAH.

05:52.753 --> 05:55.786
I SAW THAT HIT.
THAT WAS A BAD HIT.

05:55.786 --> 05:57.958
I-I KNEW IT
THE MINUTE I SAW IT.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.130
I KNEW BEFORE YOU EVEN
HIT THE GROUND, THAT WAS BAD.
HEY, HI, SWEETHEART.

06:00.130 --> 06:02.693
OH, AND THAT'S MY BOY.
OH, HE'S VERY CUTE.

06:02.693 --> 06:04.835
DR. SHEPHERD--
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

06:04.835 --> 06:07.097
NOW I CAN'T HAVE YOU IN HERE
WITH THE BABY, OKAY?

06:07.097 --> 06:09.099
OKAY, UM, LITTLEST HIGH-FIVE
IN THE WORLD.

06:09.099 --> 06:10.941
(Miranda) HEY,
WE'LL COME AND FIND YOU

06:10.941 --> 06:13.474
THE SECOND WE KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.
I LOVE YOU, BABE.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.906
DON'T GIVE HIM TOO MUCH
MORPHINE. IT MAKES HIM GOOFY.
I WON'T, I WON'T.

06:15.906 --> 06:18.579
HOW GREAT IS THAT KID, HUH?
HE'S PRETTY GREAT.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.751
DID YOU TELL SLOAN
TO MOVE OUT?

06:20.751 --> 06:23.113
NO. NOT THAT
IT'S A BAD IDEA, BUT--

06:23.113 --> 06:25.115
YOU'RE MAKING HER
FEEL LIKE CRAP.

06:25.115 --> 06:28.118
SHE SAID YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
BE ALONE IN A ROOM WITH HER.
NO, THAT--THAT'S NOT--

06:28.118 --> 06:30.491
THEN WHY DO I HAVE TO
CHAPERONE THE ULTRASOUND?

06:30.491 --> 06:34.024
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE BABY.

06:34.024 --> 06:36.667
(Lexie) SEE RIGHT THERE
ON THE LEFT THIGH.

06:36.667 --> 06:38.999
YEAH. ON HIS OTHER
ANKLE, TOO.
WAIT. IT'S A BOY?

06:38.999 --> 06:41.732
I HADN'T GOTTEN
THAT FAR.

06:41.732 --> 06:43.804
OH! OH, SORRY.
CONGRATULATIONS.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.136
UH, THERE'S A LOT OF SWELLING
ON THE RIGHT FOOT.

06:46.136 --> 06:49.079
IT'S--IT'S VERY CONSTRICTED.
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

06:49.079 --> 06:51.081
WELL, THE BABY'S GOT STRANDS

06:51.081 --> 06:53.744
OF AMNIOTIC TISSUE
WRAPPED AROUND HIS LEGS.

06:53.744 --> 06:56.416
THEY'RE CALLED AMNIOTIC BANDS.
THERE'S A DANGER OF THEM
COMPROMISING ONE OF HIS LIMBS.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.690
SO WHAT? ONE OF HIS LEGS
IS GONNA, LIKE, FALL OFF?

06:59.690 --> 07:02.052
THAT'S
THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO.

07:02.052 --> 07:06.126
HE'S GONNA HAVE STUMPS?
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH YET.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.958
WHATEVER IT IS,
WE'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF IT.

07:07.958 --> 07:10.801
I CAN'T HAVE A STUMPY BABY.
CAN'T YOU FIX IT?

07:10.801 --> 07:13.504
UM, I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE AN IDEA.

07:13.504 --> 07:15.506
HOW ABOUT WE DON'T ANSWER
ANY PATIENT QUESTIONS

07:15.506 --> 07:18.008
WITH THE PHRASE,
"UM, I DON'T KNOW"?

07:18.008 --> 07:22.112
WE'RE GONNA FIX IT. UH,
LET'S, UH, GET A FETAL M.R.I.

07:22.112 --> 07:26.116
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE
THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND--
I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU.
YOU'RE DONE.

07:26.116 --> 07:28.879
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

07:36.026 --> 07:38.489
GET ME ADDISON MONTGOMERY.

07:46.236 --> 07:47.938
(elevator bell dings)

07:47.938 --> 07:50.070
I ADORE YOU.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.072
I WAS IN THE MIDDLE
OF BREAKFAST.

07:52.072 --> 07:55.075
UH, SHE HAD AN M.R.I.
RIGHT'S WORSE THAN THE LEFT.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.578
I JUST NEED TO SAY IT ONCE.
GO AHEAD.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.110
GRANDPA. (laughs)
GRANDPA, GRANDPA, GRANDPA.

08:00.110 --> 08:02.112
OH, OKAY.
THAT WAS FOUR TIMES.

08:02.112 --> 08:04.114
IS IT OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM?
I DON'T KNOW.

08:04.114 --> 08:06.757
LOOK AT THAT. HE THINKS HE'S GOT
AN OPENING BEHIND MARTIN,

08:06.757 --> 08:08.488
AND THEN--
OOH! OUCH.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.091
BACK THAT UP AGAIN.
OKAY, I WOULD NEVER ASK
FOR AN AUTOGRAPH,

08:11.091 --> 08:13.093
BUT IF HE SIGNED
A CONSENT FORM

08:13.093 --> 08:16.166
AND THERE WAS A COPY LAYING
AROUND--WHAT? BIG FAN.
TORRES.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.068
WHAT?
OH, HEY!
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

08:18.068 --> 08:20.070
HI. (laughs)
DID YOU GET LOST
ON THE FREEWAY?

08:20.070 --> 08:22.502
(Derek) GOOD TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU. UM--

08:22.502 --> 08:24.535
(Miranda) WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?
SLOAN'S GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH THE BABY.

08:24.535 --> 08:26.537
OH, IS SHE OKAY?
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

08:26.537 --> 08:28.909
I'M GONNA GO SEE
IF THEY'RE READY.
OKAY.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.141
YOU KNOW HOW LONG
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT?

08:31.141 --> 08:33.884
WHAT, YOU PULL OUT
HIS BLOOD WITH LEECHES?
OOH.

08:33.884 --> 08:36.887
UH, SHE'S PERKIER THAN USUAL.
(laughs)
(laughs) WELL, DIVORCE
WILL DO THAT TO YOU.

08:36.887 --> 08:39.820
AH, SAD.
NO, SHE'LL MOVE ON
AND BE HAPPY.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.122
YEAH.
SHE JUST NEEDS SOMEBODY
TO MOVE ON TO.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.154
WELL, THAT CAN'T BE SO HARD.
(chuckles)

08:44.154 --> 08:47.057
HEY, WAIT. WHAT ABOUT YOU?
CAN'T YOU FIND HER SOMEONE?

08:47.057 --> 08:50.200
THAT GUY FROM ONCOLOGY, THE CUTE
ONE--ISN'T HE STILL HERE?
THIS IS NOT MY AREA.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.834
HE USED TO PLAY BASKETBALL
WITH HIM. DAVE. DAVE--
TORRES SHOULD DO IT.
THEY'RE FRIENDS.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.707
OH, SHE THINKS I'M LOOPY.
YOU ARE LOOPY.

08:56.707 --> 08:59.169
OKAY, COME ON. (lowered voice)
IT'S BAILEY. SHE'S LONELY.
I--

08:59.169 --> 09:00.941
HEY.
YEAH.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.213
HE NEEDS A TRANSFUSION.

09:03.213 --> 09:05.846
THAT SPLENIC LAC IS BLEEDING
MORE THAN I THOUGHT.
ALL RIGHT. WE'LL TAKE
A LOOK AT THE C.T.s

09:05.846 --> 09:08.078
AND COME UP WITH A, UH,
GAME PLAN.

09:08.078 --> 09:09.780
(clears throat) ALL SET.

09:09.780 --> 09:12.122
AH. OKAY.
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

09:12.122 --> 09:14.084
S--

09:14.084 --> 09:15.986
(chuckles) YOU KNOW DAVE
FROM ONCOLOGY?

09:15.986 --> 09:17.287
SINGLE.

09:17.287 --> 09:19.289
YOU WOULDN'T BE STARTING
A CONVERSATION

09:19.289 --> 09:22.062
ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE,
WOULD YOU?
BAD IDEA? HE'S HANDSOME.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.994
BAD IDEA.

09:23.994 --> 09:26.597
OKAY. I TRIED.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.170
HI, RUTHIE.
THIS IS DR. YANG.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.172
SHE'LL BE PERFORMING
YOUR SURGERY TODAY.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.175
SHE IS THE BEST OF THE BEST.
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE HER.

09:35.175 --> 09:38.649
OH, GOOD. I AM SO GLAD
TO MEET YOU.
HI.

09:38.649 --> 09:41.181
UM, I HAVE A COUPLE THINGS
I WANT TO DISCUSS.
OH.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.183
IS THAT--CAN I...
OF COURSE, OF COURSE.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.955
UM, I HAVE ALLERGIES.
MM-HMM.

09:44.955 --> 09:46.957
I-I KNOW THEY WRITE THEM
IN THE CHART,

09:46.957 --> 09:48.959
BUT I FIND THAT
IF YOU DON'T TELL EVERYONE,

09:48.959 --> 09:51.021
YOU KNOW, IT KIND OF
GETS LOTS IN THE SHUFFLE.

09:51.021 --> 09:52.623
(mutters)
YEAH.

09:52.623 --> 09:56.596
ASPIRIN, IBUPROFEN,
BANANAS, ZUCCHINI,

09:56.596 --> 09:58.128
ALL FORMS OF SQUASH.

09:58.128 --> 10:00.600
AND PUMPKIN IS A SQUASH,
RIGHT?

10:00.600 --> 10:03.103
MM-HMM.
PEOPLE FORGET THAT.
LATEX, DUST MITES.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.806
Y--
UH, I ASKED THE NURSE
WITH THE RED HAIR

10:05.806 --> 10:07.277
FOR A NEW PILLOW,

10:07.277 --> 10:10.140
AND, UM... (whispers) I WOULD
ALSO LOVE TO GET A NEW NURSE.

10:10.140 --> 10:12.012
(normal voice)
BECAUSE I THINK THE REDHEAD

10:12.012 --> 10:14.014
JUST BROUGHT BACK THE OLD PILLOW
WITH A NEW CASE, AND IT'S,

10:14.014 --> 10:16.146
YOU KNOW... (clears throat)
IT'S MAKING ME SNEEZY.

10:16.146 --> 10:18.849
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO GET
A MECHANICAL VALVE.
MM-HMM.

10:18.849 --> 10:21.151
BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
THE CLICKING NOISE

10:21.151 --> 10:23.153
THEY SAY THE MECHANICAL VALVE
MAKES... (makes clicking sound)

10:23.153 --> 10:25.656
I MEAN, THAT--THAT WOULD BE
IRRITATING, RIGHT?

10:25.656 --> 10:28.829
DON'T YOU THINK THAT MIGHT
JUST MAKE YOU NUTS?
I'M SORRY, BUT, UH,
A DIFFERENT VALVE

10:28.829 --> 10:30.630
IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT
PROCEDURE.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.133
YES, BUT I-I THINK THE PIG
IS A BETTER IDEA--THE PIG VALVE.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.806
YOU KNOW, IT'S ORGANIC, RIGHT?
AND THEY SAY THEY'RE VERY CLEAN.

10:35.806 --> 10:37.808
YOU KNOW,
ALL THAT BUSINESS ABOUT,

10:37.808 --> 10:40.070
"OH, YOU'RE SUCH A PIG, "RIGHT?
THAT'S JUST BAD MARKETING.

10:40.070 --> 10:43.643
OH, AND THIS, UH, BLANKET...
(sniffs) THIS HAS A SMELL.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.645
(sniffing) YEAH, IT DOES.
IT DOES SMELL.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.048
LIKE, A-A--I'M NOT SAYING IT'S
NOT CLEAN. IT'S LIKE A--

10:48.048 --> 10:50.250
A CHEMICAL OF SOME KIND, IT'S
CHAFFING. CAN YOU SEE MY RASH?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.152
AS THE LEGS CONTINUE TO GROW,

10:52.152 --> 10:55.055
THE BANDS WILL CUT OFF
HIS CIRCULATION.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.357
IF WE WAIT, WE RISK
SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE LEFT LEG,

10:57.357 --> 10:59.730
POSSIBLE LOSS
OF THE RIGHT ENTIRELY.

10:59.730 --> 11:03.433
BUT IF WE OPERATE--22 WEEKS,
IT'S--IT'S STILL RISKY.

11:03.433 --> 11:05.766
BUT IF YOU DON'T OPERATE,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KILL THE BABY.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.168
WE CAN REHABILITATE
THE REMAINING PART OF HIS LEG

11:08.168 --> 11:10.340
AFTER HE'S BORN, AND WE CAN
FIT HIM WITH A PROSTHESIS.

11:10.340 --> 11:12.402
IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE
THAT HE'LL WALK.
OH, MY GOD.

11:12.402 --> 11:14.404
HONEY,
WE'VE GOT OPTIONS HERE.

11:14.404 --> 11:17.677
IF WE OPERATE, DR. MONTGOMERY
CAN REMOVE THE BANDS,

11:17.677 --> 11:19.910
HE'LL BE JUST FINE.

11:19.910 --> 11:23.253
OR WE CAN WAIT A FEW WEEKS
TILL HE'S BIGGER AND STRONGER,

11:23.253 --> 11:26.757
AND WE KNOW THE SURGERY
IS LESS RISKY.

11:26.757 --> 11:29.359
WELL, WHICH ONE OF YOU
DID HE SLEEP WITH?

11:31.121 --> 11:33.123
OH, NOT ME.

11:33.123 --> 11:36.266
YOU TOLD HER?
SHE'S MY KID.
WE WERE BONDING.

11:36.266 --> 11:39.069
THAT IS NOT HOW YOU BOND
WITH CHILDREN.

11:39.069 --> 11:42.733
I'M STILL
GETTING THE HANG OF IT.
SO YOU'RE SURE THAT HE DIDN'T,
LIKE, KNOCK YOU UP

11:42.733 --> 11:46.036
AND LEAVE YOU WITH A CHILD TO
RAISE ON YOUR OWN OR SOMETHING?
WH--

11:46.036 --> 11:47.978
YOU'RE NOT JUST,
LIKE, REALLY PISSED

11:47.978 --> 11:50.881
AND YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET REVENGE?
NO. (chuckles) NO.

11:50.881 --> 11:53.113
IT--IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,
OKAY?

11:53.113 --> 11:55.786
THE FACT IS, MARK--

11:55.786 --> 11:57.417
YOUR FATHER--
IS--IS A GOOD GUY,

11:57.417 --> 11:59.419
AND I THINK YOU'RE
A GOOD KID, AND I'M GONNA DO

11:59.419 --> 12:01.491
EVERYTHING I CAN
TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR BABY.

12:01.491 --> 12:04.254
OKAY, WELL, LET'S JUST GET
THESE THINGS OFF HIS LEGS

12:04.254 --> 12:07.357
RIGHT NOW.
I'LL BOOK AN O.R.

12:09.229 --> 12:13.203
STUPID QUARTERBACK
ONLY HAS A CONCUSSION.

12:13.203 --> 12:15.035
TRAGIC.
I KNOW.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.336
I'M ON HIS ORTHO STUFF.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.338
THERE'S BOUND TO BE
A SURGERY IN THERE.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.340
YOU WANT TO SHARE?
(scoffs) WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

12:20.340 --> 12:22.342
'CAUSE YOU LIKE ME.
NOT THAT MUCH.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.344
OH, SURE YOU DO. COME ON.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.076
LET ME SCRUB IN,

12:26.076 --> 12:28.779
AND I WILL TAKE YOU OUT
FOR DRINKS AFTERWARDS

12:28.779 --> 12:31.221
AND, YOU KNOW...

12:31.221 --> 12:32.923
(elevator bell dings)

12:34.424 --> 12:36.426
REALLY?

12:36.426 --> 12:37.828
OKAY.

12:37.828 --> 12:40.831
(indistinct conversations)

12:42.492 --> 12:44.364
WHAT?

12:44.364 --> 12:47.067
LET ME TAKE YOU OUT FOR DRINKS
AND, YOU KNOW?

12:47.067 --> 12:48.368
WHAT'S "YOU KNOW"?

12:48.368 --> 12:51.171
WHATEVER.
IT'S SEX.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.203
CHARLIE, GET OVER IT.

12:53.203 --> 12:55.205
YOU'RE TRADING SEX FOR SURGERY.
THAT'S PROSTITUTION.

12:55.205 --> 12:57.247
IS THAT THE PART
I'M SUPPOSED TO GET OVER?

12:57.247 --> 13:00.110
ARE YOU CALLING ME A WHORE?
EXPLAIN WHAT "YOU KNOW" MEANS.

13:00.110 --> 13:02.552
I'M MESSING WITH HIM.
KAREV KNOWS IT, AND I KNOW IT.

13:02.552 --> 13:05.115
HE'S GONNA WANT TO COLLECT.

13:05.115 --> 13:08.118
CHARLIE... (whispers) GO FIND
SOMETHING ELSE TO WORRY ABOUT.

13:08.118 --> 13:11.121
(indistinct conversations)

13:19.269 --> 13:21.271
DR. BAILEY...

13:21.271 --> 13:24.905
THIS IS, UH, DR. STANTON
FROM RADIOLOGY.

13:24.905 --> 13:28.208
ROB, MIRANDA. ROB WAS LOOKING
OVER TOM'S C.T.,

13:28.208 --> 13:30.110
AND I THOUGHT
HE SHOULD TALK TO YOU.
OH, OKAY.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.342
ROB'S NEW HERE, SO I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT GIVE HIM

13:32.342 --> 13:34.544
A TOUR OF THE HOSPITAL
WHILE YOU DISCUSS THE C.T.

13:34.544 --> 13:38.048
(elevator bell dings)

13:38.048 --> 13:39.549
(sighs) EXCUSE ME.

13:39.549 --> 13:41.251
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:41.251 --> 13:43.293
YOU SPENT CHRISTMAS WITH ME
AND MEREDITH.

13:43.293 --> 13:46.296
THAT CAN'T BE WHAT YOU WANT.
TRUE, BUT I DO HAVE
A PATIENT

13:46.296 --> 13:48.528
THAT I HAVE TO DO
A FOLLOW-UP ON RIGHT NOW.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.501
SO I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO TAKE ANYBODY--
I CAN DO THAT. FOLLOW-UP'S EASY.
I CAN DO THAT.

13:51.501 --> 13:53.203
HAVE FUN. TAKE CARE.
I--

13:53.203 --> 13:55.605
OKAY, HAVE A GOOD TOUR.
YOU WANT TO SHOW ME
THE SCAN?

13:55.605 --> 13:58.869
UM, HOW ABOUT WE, UH,
LOOK AT IT OVER LUNCH?

14:01.471 --> 14:04.444
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A DIVORCE.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.276
PEOPLE CALL ME THE NAZI,

14:06.276 --> 14:08.578
AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF
MY ICE BLUE EYES.

14:08.578 --> 14:12.122
I SPEND 12 HOURS A DAY CARVING
PEOPLE UP, AND I LIKE IT.

14:12.122 --> 14:16.026
I HAVE A CHILD, AND I HAVE
NO ROOM FOR CASUAL ANYTHING.

14:16.026 --> 14:19.029
I'M ANGRY ALL OF THE TIME
AND DEEPLY CONFUSED

14:19.029 --> 14:22.032
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY
LIFE HAVE LET ME DOWN RECENTLY.

14:22.032 --> 14:23.333
ONE OF THEM WAS ME.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.865
IT'S DEVASTATING,
BUT NOT COMPLETELY,

14:25.865 --> 14:28.868
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT I LIKE
SLEEPING CROSSWISE IN THE BED

14:28.868 --> 14:31.201
AND NOT HAVING TO SHAVE
MY LEGS.

14:31.201 --> 14:34.204
MY 3 YEAR OLD USED TO BE
POTTY TRAINED, AND NOW HE ISN'T

14:34.204 --> 14:36.206
BECAUSE HIS FATHER
NO LONGER LIVES WITH US

14:36.206 --> 14:38.208
AND HIS WORLD
NO LONGER MAKES SENSE,

14:38.208 --> 14:41.251
AND THE ONLY THING HE THINKS
HE CAN CONTROL IS HIS BLADDER.

14:41.251 --> 14:42.552
SO HE URINATES

14:42.552 --> 14:45.515
IN A LOT OF PLACES
YOU WISH HE WOULDN'T URINATE.

14:45.515 --> 14:49.889
YOU WANT LUNCH OR YOU WANT
TO SHOW ME THE SCAN?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.191
(clears throat)

14:53.663 --> 14:55.395
MR. MORRIS. DR. SHEPHERD.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.397
I'LL BE FILLING IN
FOR DR. BAILEY TODAY.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.470
SO YOU'RE HERE
FOR A FOLLOW-UP?
UH, YEAH, YEAH.

15:00.470 --> 15:03.403
I HAD MY GALL BLADDER OUT
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.
MONTHS? AND YOU'RE STILL
GETTING FOLLOW-UPS?

15:03.403 --> 15:06.036
I AM, ONCE A WEEK.
ONCE A WEEK?

15:06.036 --> 15:09.039
(laughs) YEAH. DR. BAILEY SAYS
SHE JUST WANTS TO MAKE SURE

15:09.039 --> 15:11.611
I'M IN TIP-TOP SHAPE.
DR. WEBBER DID YOUR SURGERY?

15:11.611 --> 15:13.944
YEAH. CHIEF OF SURGERY.
FANCY, HUH?
YEAH. MM-HMM.

15:13.944 --> 15:15.245
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.

15:15.245 --> 15:17.948
PEOPLE SAY A LOT OF CRAP
ABOUT HEALTH CARE,

15:17.948 --> 15:19.349
BUT THEY'VE NEVER BEEN HERE.

15:19.349 --> 15:21.591
YOU TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE.

15:21.591 --> 15:23.293
WE CERTAINLY DO.
YEAH.

15:23.293 --> 15:25.295
MM.
DR. BAILEY WAS ALL WORRIED

15:25.295 --> 15:27.197
'CAUSE I TURNED YELLOW
AFTER MY FIRST SURGERY.

15:27.197 --> 15:28.959
MM-HMM.
OH, SEE?

15:28.959 --> 15:30.160
HERE.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.162
BUT IT WENT AWAY.
(laughs)

15:32.162 --> 15:35.135
I'M FINE NOW. YOU WANT
TO LOOK AT MY SCAR

15:35.135 --> 15:37.107
OR WAIT TILL AFTER
I PEE IN THE CUP?

15:37.107 --> 15:39.569
OH, DR. ALTMAN, UH, THE PATIENT
IS NO LONGER INTERESTED

15:39.569 --> 15:41.271
IN THE MECHANICAL VALVE.

15:41.271 --> 15:42.572
WELL, I COULDN'T GIVE YOU

15:42.572 --> 15:44.274
A TOTAL UNADULTERATED
DREAM CASE.

15:44.274 --> 15:45.545
PEOPLE WOULD TALK.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.248
UH, I JUST SPENT HOURS
PREPPING FOR THE MECHANICAL.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.251
A-A PIG VALVE
IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT SURGERY.
TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.683
JUST THINK ABOUT
HOW MUCH YOU'RE LEARNING.

15:53.683 --> 15:56.956
YOU WANT ME TO GET
SOMEONE ELSE?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.288
NO.

15:58.288 --> 16:00.460
(elevator bell dings)

16:00.460 --> 16:02.592
IT'S A CONCUSSION. IT'S NO WORSE
THAN YOU'VE SEEN BEFORE.

16:02.592 --> 16:04.694
NOTHING WE NEED
TO GO IN AND FIX.

16:04.694 --> 16:06.296
INITIALLY WE THOUGHT

16:06.296 --> 16:09.239
THE INJURY TO YOUR SPLEEN
WOULD RESOLVE ITSELF,

16:09.239 --> 16:12.042
BUT IT'S BLEEDING TOO MUCH.
DR. BAILEY NEEDS TO GO IN

16:12.042 --> 16:15.275
AND REMOVE IT
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
THE SURGERY IS GONNA HAVE
YOU OUT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS,

16:15.275 --> 16:17.977
BUT YOU'LL BE BACK IN THE GAME
FOR NEXT SEASON.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.479
(monitor beeping erratically)

16:19.479 --> 16:21.651
(gasping)

16:21.651 --> 16:24.714
TOM? YOU ALL RIGHT?
OH, I CAN'T--I CAN'T--
I CAN'T BREATHE.

16:24.714 --> 16:27.657
I CAN'T BREATHE.
LET'S GET SOME OXYGEN.
GET A CRASH CART. TOM?

16:27.657 --> 16:30.290
LET'S GET SOME OXYGEN,
ALL RIGHT?
I CAN'T BREATHE.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.122
(speaks indistinctly)

16:41.031 --> 16:43.173
LET'S GET AN E.K.G.
JUST IN CASE.

16:43.173 --> 16:46.176
TOM, HAVE YOU EVER HAD
A PANIC ATTACK BEFORE?
I'M FINE.

16:46.176 --> 16:48.638
IT'S JUST, UH...

16:48.638 --> 16:50.340
IT'S NOTHING.

16:50.340 --> 16:52.182
(singsong voice)
THERE'S DADDY.

16:52.182 --> 16:54.544
HEY, HOW'S MY GUY?
(normal voice) HE'S FINE.

16:54.544 --> 16:57.187
HOW'S MY GUY?
(Derek) WELL, HE WAS, UM--

16:57.187 --> 16:59.189
THE, UM, BRAIN'S OKAY.

16:59.189 --> 17:00.550
(baby coos)

17:00.550 --> 17:03.093
BUT THEY GOTTA
CUT MY BELLY OPEN.

17:03.093 --> 17:05.425
I CAN'T PLAY
TILL NEXT SEASON.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.197
HONEY...

17:07.197 --> 17:08.698
DON'T WORRY.

17:08.698 --> 17:11.701
NEXT SEASON WILL
BE HERE BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.610
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH YOU AND REED?

17:20.610 --> 17:24.574
NOTHING.
YOU'RE NOT TRADING HER SURGERY
FOR SEX, ARE YOU?

17:24.574 --> 17:27.547
GIVE ME A BREAK,
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE,
IT'S GROSS.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.180
LOOK, IF I SLEEP WITH HER,
IT'S 'CAUSE I WANT TO.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.352
YOU GONNA
LOOK ME IN THE EYE

17:32.352 --> 17:35.054
AND TELL ME DEREK NEVER
THREW A CRANIOTOMY YOUR WAY

17:35.054 --> 17:37.427
AFTER THE TWO OF YOU SPENT
AN HOUR IN THE ON-CALL ROOM?

17:37.427 --> 17:40.260
PLEASE.
I KNOW IT MAY NOT FEEL LIKE IT,
BUT YOU ARE STILL MARRIED,

17:40.260 --> 17:42.762
AND IZZIE IS COMING--
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M DONE
WORRYING ABOUT IZZIE

17:42.762 --> 17:46.466
'CAUSE SHE SURE AS HELL
AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT ME.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.438
THIS IS THE OLD ALEX--

17:48.438 --> 17:50.440
SLEEPING WITH
SOME RANDOM PERSON

17:50.440 --> 17:53.303
BECAUSE YOU'RE ANGRY AND HURT.
THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS DID.

17:53.303 --> 17:55.575
AND THEN WE GREW UP
AND GOT MARRIED.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.577
YEAH, WELL, IT TURNS OUT
YOUR STUPID POST-IT

17:57.577 --> 18:00.850
IS TEN TIMES THE MARRIAGE
MY CHURCH WEDDING EVER GOT ME.

18:00.850 --> 18:04.314
I'M MOVING ON.

18:04.314 --> 18:06.386
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

18:06.386 --> 18:10.820
HEY, TOM KATES
IS HAVING PANIC ATTACKS?
YEAH. I DON'T KNOW WHY.
HE'S NOT TALKING.

18:10.820 --> 18:13.323
I TOOK CARE OF YOUR, UH,
CHOLE PATIENT. IT'S ALL GOOD.

18:13.323 --> 18:16.296
UH, THANKS.
YEAH, HE'S GETTING
SOME HIGH-CLASS CARE.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.767
SIX VISITS WITH A SURGEON?

18:17.767 --> 18:19.799
A NURSE PRACTITIONER
COULD DO THIS.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.801
NO, I LIKE TO DO, UH,
AFTERCARE MYSELF.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.774
HE WASN'T EVEN YOUR PATIENT.
HE WAS THE CHIEF'S.

18:24.774 --> 18:26.676
THERE WAS AN ERROR.
HE'S FINE.

18:26.676 --> 18:29.209
SO WHY ALL THE--
I HAVE A THING FOR HIM, OKAY?

18:30.880 --> 18:32.382
SHELDON MORRIS?

18:32.382 --> 18:34.384
HE CAUGHT MY EYE.

18:34.384 --> 18:36.186
(elevator bell dings)

18:36.186 --> 18:40.220
SHELDON HAS A QUALITY
THAT I'M...

18:40.220 --> 18:41.851
DRAWN TO.

18:41.851 --> 18:47.597
I... I CAN'T PUT MY FINGER
ON WHAT IT IS EXACTLY.

18:47.597 --> 18:51.231
SURE. SURE.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.902
WANT TO KEEP HIS PICTURE?

18:55.165 --> 18:57.136
(chuckles)

18:58.568 --> 19:01.271
DO YOU KNOW WHAT MY SISTER
HAD FOR LUNCH TODAY?

19:01.271 --> 19:03.243
PORK CHOPS.
I WATCHED HER EAT.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.775
I DIDN'T FEEL ANY KINSHIP...

19:05.775 --> 19:07.517
WITH THE PIG.

19:07.517 --> 19:11.221
I THINK THE PIG VALVE, YOU KNOW,
MAY BE THE WRONG CHOICE.

19:11.221 --> 19:15.425
UH, YOU FEEL MORE KINSHIP
WITH COWS?

19:15.425 --> 19:17.687
I DON'T KNOW.

19:17.687 --> 19:20.430
MRS. CARLIN, UM, WE'VE PREPARED
THE PORCINE VALVE REPLACEMENT.

19:20.430 --> 19:24.564
UH, A BOVINE REPLACEMENT
IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT SURGERY,

19:24.564 --> 19:28.768
LIKE THE MECHANICAL VALVE
WAS A WHOLE DIFFERENT SURGERY.
DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT I COULD SEE THE VALVES--

19:28.768 --> 19:31.471
RIGHT, THE PIG AND THE COW?
CAUSE MAYBE THEN I COULD--

19:31.471 --> 19:34.404
I COULD RECOGNIZE ONE
AS MORE FAMILIAR.
WELL, WE DON'T DO THAT.

19:34.404 --> 19:36.946
WE DON'T MARCH THE PARTS
AROUND THE HOSPITAL.
MAYBE WE SHOULD
CALL THIS OFF.

19:36.946 --> 19:40.280
CAN I DO THAT?
IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE,
WE CAN POSTPONE IT.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.283
UH, NO, NO, NO, NO. I MEAN,
I-I CAN GET THE VALVES...

19:43.283 --> 19:45.385
AND I'LL BRING THEM HERE.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.786
OH!
OKAY?

19:46.786 --> 19:49.419
YOU'RE SO WONDERFUL.

19:49.419 --> 19:51.421
YOU REALLY ARE. YOU'RE...
OKAY. GREAT.

19:51.421 --> 19:52.422
GREAT.

19:52.422 --> 19:53.823
(laughs) OH.

19:53.823 --> 19:56.466
(whispers)
SHE'S SO WONDERFUL.

19:56.466 --> 19:58.498
(whispers) SHE IS.
(normal voice) OH!

20:00.500 --> 20:03.773
RICHARD... TOM KATES
NEEDS A SPLENECTOMY.

20:03.773 --> 20:06.976
ANY CHANCE I CAN GET YOU
TO DO THE PROCEDURE?

20:06.976 --> 20:10.340
OH, WELL, I'VE, UH, ASKED BAILEY
TO TAKE OVER MY SERVICE,

20:10.340 --> 20:13.313
YOU KNOW, WITH--
WITH THE MERGER AND ALL.
IT'S A HIGH-PROFILE PATIENT.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.685
I THOUGHT YOU COULD MAKE
AN EXCEPTION.

20:17.247 --> 20:19.349
SURE.

20:24.754 --> 20:27.257
(Cristina) YOU MUST HAVE EXTRAS
LYING AROUND.

20:27.257 --> 20:30.430
WE DON'T.
WHAT, YOU--YOU NEVER
DROP ONE?

20:30.430 --> 20:32.001
OPEN UP THE BOX AND SEE

20:32.001 --> 20:34.003
THAT THE PIG
HAS A CHOLESTEROL PROBLEM?

20:34.003 --> 20:36.266
LET ME CHECK IN THE BACK.
OKAY.

20:36.266 --> 20:39.409
SHE THINKS MAYBE ONE OF THEM
WILL SPEAK TO HER.
IT'S RINGING.

20:39.409 --> 20:41.271
I MEAN, I AM PREPPING

20:41.271 --> 20:43.513
FOR THREE DIFFERENT SURGERIES
IN ONE DAY,

20:43.513 --> 20:45.315
CHASING ANIMAL PARTS
ALL OVER THE HOSPITAL.

20:45.315 --> 20:48.318
TEDDY THINKS IT'S HYSTERICAL,
BUT THIS MAY ACTUALLY KILL ME.

20:48.318 --> 20:50.450
MAYBE ONE OF THEM
WILL SPEAK TO HER.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.782
THERE ARE PROS AND CONS
FOR EACH.

20:52.782 --> 20:55.785
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
IT'S A GUT THING--PIG OR COW?
IT'S NOT A GUT THING.

20:55.785 --> 20:58.428
IT'S A DECISION
BASED ON FACT AND REASON.

20:58.428 --> 21:00.490
HEY! WHERE ARE MY PARTS?
IZZIE, IT'S ME.

21:00.490 --> 21:04.263
UM, I KNOW YOU WANT SPACE,
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE SPACE.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.397
BECAUSE ALEX
MIGHT BE MOVING ON.
COME BACK AND WORK
IN THE CLINIC,

21:07.397 --> 21:10.400
'CAUSE YOU'RE THROWING
YOUR CAREER AWAY.
CRISTINA.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.442
SHE GOT FIRED FROM SURGERY,
NOT ALL MEDICINE.

21:12.442 --> 21:15.375
IGNORE HER. JUST CALL ME BACK.
OKAY, BYE.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.646
(cell phone beeps)

21:16.646 --> 21:21.280
THERE. THAT WASN'T
SO DIFFICULT, WAS IT?

21:23.052 --> 21:25.815
OKAY.
GOT THE FIRST BAND.

21:25.815 --> 21:28.988
LET'S MOVE DOWN SO I CAN
TAKE A LOOK AT THE SECOND.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.721
(Lexie) LIKE THAT?

21:31.721 --> 21:33.022
GOOD.

21:33.022 --> 21:36.566
WHY CAN'T I GRAB HIS LEG?

21:36.566 --> 21:38.428
PROBLEM?

21:38.428 --> 21:40.870
NO, IT'S JUST ONE OF THE BANDS
IS HOLDING THE LEG IN PLACE,

21:40.870 --> 21:43.433
MAKING IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT
TO GET AROUND.

21:43.433 --> 21:45.535
CAN YOU MOVE THE ULTRASOUND
UP HERE?

21:45.535 --> 21:47.837
OH, COME ON.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

21:47.837 --> 21:50.640
HER UTERINE ARTERIES
ARE ENGORGED.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.683
BUT THE ONLY WAY IN
IS IN BETWEEN THEM.

21:53.683 --> 21:55.815
OKAY, I'M GONNA NEED
ANOTHER TROCAR.

21:55.815 --> 21:58.418
YOU WANT TO HOLD THIS?
ARE YOU SURE YOU HAVE
ENOUGH ROOM?

21:58.418 --> 22:02.091
THOSE ARTERIES ARE HUGE.
THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA BE
VERY, VERY CAREFUL. SCALPEL.

22:02.091 --> 22:05.425
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU NICK THEM?
DR. GREY?

22:05.425 --> 22:08.458
SHE COULD BLEED OUT.
THEY BOTH COULD.

22:08.458 --> 22:12.932
I DON'T LIKE IT.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
MARK, I HAVE ASSESSED
THE RISK FACTORS.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.104
I'M 95% CONFIDENT I CAN
GET AROUND THE ARTERIES.

22:15.104 --> 22:17.106
I'M CHOOSING TO CONTINUE
MY SURGERY.

22:17.106 --> 22:19.369
AND I DON'T LIKE
THE OTHER 5%.

22:19.369 --> 22:21.110
YOU HIT ANY ONE OF THOSE,

22:21.110 --> 22:23.943
SHE BLEEDS OUT
RIGHT ON THIS TABLE.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.115
LOOK, YOU'RE NERVOUS.
I GET THAT.

22:26.115 --> 22:29.649
I'M A SURGEON, AND I'M LOOKING
AT A TIME BOMB IN A UTERUS.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.551
SHUT IT DOWN. NOW, ADDISON.

22:35.985 --> 22:37.987
LET'S CLOSE HER UP.

22:49.899 --> 22:51.901
(woman) I'VE GOT SIX SO FAR.
(woman) FORCEPS?

22:51.901 --> 22:54.504
YOU GOOD TO GO?
(Miranda) YEAH.
WHAT, ARE YOU BABYSITTING?

22:54.504 --> 22:57.006
'CAUSE I'M NEW AT THIS.
WHERE'S THE CHIEF?

22:57.006 --> 22:59.449
I DON'T KNOW.
CHECK HIS OFFICE.

22:59.449 --> 23:02.081
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA DO
THE SURGERY.
AND THEN HE TOLD ME
HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME

23:02.081 --> 23:04.083
AND ASKED ME
IF I WOULD DO IT,

23:04.083 --> 23:07.457
WHICH I WAS PLANNING ON DOING IN
THE FIRST PLACE, SO I SAID YES.

23:07.457 --> 23:09.489
UH, HE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A BUDGET MEETING.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.861
I THINK HE'S PRETTY SWAMPED.
IF HE'S GOT TIME TO WATCH

23:11.861 --> 23:13.863
OLD SURGICAL FILMS WITH YOU,
HE'S NOT SWAMPED.

23:13.863 --> 23:15.825
(lowered voice)
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

23:15.825 --> 23:17.126
THE CHOLE PATIENT,
YOUR BOYFRIEND?

23:17.126 --> 23:18.828
THAT WAS THE CHIEF'S MISTAKE.

23:18.828 --> 23:21.030
AND HE HASN'T TOUCHED
A PATIENT SINCE THEN.

23:21.030 --> 23:23.433
HE'S BEEN BUSY
WITH THE MERGER.

23:23.433 --> 23:25.875
YEAH, I'VE HEARD
THAT STORY BEFORE.

23:25.875 --> 23:28.778
WHAT IS GOING ON?

23:28.778 --> 23:30.680
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

23:30.680 --> 23:34.083
IT IS NOT MY JOB TO GET
INVOLVED IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE

23:34.083 --> 23:37.917
JUST LIKE IT'S NOT YOUR JOB
TO GET INVOLVED IN MINE.

23:42.051 --> 23:44.524
10-BLADE.

23:44.524 --> 23:47.026
I MADE A JUDGMENT CALL.
YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.628
I'M SORRY.

23:48.628 --> 23:51.531
YOU THREW ME ON A PLANE IN
THE MIDDLE OF MY MORNING COFFEE

23:51.531 --> 23:53.533
BECAUSE YOU WANTED
MY JUDGMENT.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.034
IT WAS RISKY.

23:55.034 --> 23:58.037
THAT IS NOT YOUR CALL TO MAKE
IN MY O.R.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.539
YOU ACTED LIKE A FATHER.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.612
WHY DO YOU THINK WE DON'T
LET PARENTS IN THE ROOM

24:02.612 --> 24:05.114
DURING AN OPERATION?
I'M NOT HER FATHER, ADDISON.

24:05.114 --> 24:08.117
BIOLOGICALLY, YES,
BUT... I JUST MET THE KID.

24:08.117 --> 24:10.019
I'M HELPING OUT.

24:10.019 --> 24:12.021
YOU REACTED LIKE A PARENT.

24:12.021 --> 24:15.024
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHEN,
I DON'T KNOW HOW,

24:15.024 --> 24:18.528
BUT AT SOME POINT, YOU BECAME
A DAD TO THAT LITTLE URCHIN,

24:18.528 --> 24:20.530
BECAUSE YOU JUST LOST IT
IN MY O.R.,

24:20.530 --> 24:22.832
AND MARK SLOAN NEVER LOSES IT
IN THE O.R.

24:22.832 --> 24:25.635
NOT EVER.

24:25.635 --> 24:27.136
YES, IT WAS RISKY,

24:27.136 --> 24:29.138
AND, YES, MOST SURGEONS
WOULD'VE JUMPED SHIP

24:29.138 --> 24:31.100
AT THE SIGHT
OF THE ENGORGED ARTERIES.

24:31.100 --> 24:34.604
BUT I AM NOT MOST SURGEONS,
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

24:37.146 --> 24:39.509
LOOK, WE CAN TRY THIS AGAIN...

24:39.509 --> 24:41.881
WITH YOU IN THE WAITING ROOM.

24:43.583 --> 24:47.156
IT'S TOO RISKY.
SHE'S JUST A KID.

24:47.156 --> 24:49.188
WELL, UH, HAVE MORRISON

24:49.188 --> 24:51.190
MONITOR THE BANDS
AS THE BABY GROWS.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.062
IT MIGHT BE OKAY.

24:53.062 --> 24:56.265
I GOTTA GO.
PATIENTS AT HOME.

24:58.267 --> 24:59.829
CONGRATULATIONS.

24:59.829 --> 25:02.532
YOU'RE A PARENT.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.578
(sighs)

25:20.289 --> 25:22.822
NEITHER ONE
IS SPEAKING TO ME.
OH, FOR GOD SAKE.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.554
ARE THEY SPEAKING TO YOU?
THEY AREN'T.

25:24.554 --> 25:27.156
RUTHIE, IF I PUT YOUR OWN VALVE
IN FRONT OF YOU,

25:27.156 --> 25:30.059
IT WOULDN'T
SPEAK TO YOU EITHER.
I HAVE A COUSIN.
HIS WIFE IS A CARDIOLOGIST.

25:30.059 --> 25:32.161
I SHOULD CALL HER.
NO, NO, NO, OKAY? NO.

25:32.161 --> 25:35.565
NO MORE CALLS. THIS IS ABOUT
YOU AND YOUR HEART.

25:35.565 --> 25:38.167
AND YOU NEED TO USE YOUR
INSTINCT AND MAKE A DECISION.

25:38.167 --> 25:40.209
RIGHT NOW--
PIG OR COW?

25:40.209 --> 25:41.611
BUT I--
PIG OR COW?

25:41.611 --> 25:44.143
PIG OR COW? DON'T THINK.
JUST--PIG OR COW? GO.

25:44.143 --> 25:47.116
NOW! NOW!
PIG. (groans) NO. COW.

25:47.116 --> 25:50.319
PIG! PIG! PIG. PIG.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.984
PIG.

25:54.984 --> 25:56.986
(sighs)

25:56.986 --> 25:58.287
THE PROCEDURE WENT WELL.

25:58.287 --> 26:01.190
YOU'RE GONNA BE BACK
ON YOUR FEET IN NO TIME.

26:01.190 --> 26:03.292
GREAT.

26:03.292 --> 26:05.264
GREAT.

26:07.196 --> 26:09.338
YOU'RE SCARED TO PLAY.

26:09.338 --> 26:12.802
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE DONE.

26:12.802 --> 26:15.805
AND WHEN I SAID YOU'D BE
BACK IN THE GAME NEXT SEASON,

26:15.805 --> 26:17.306
YOU PANICKED.

26:20.309 --> 26:25.284
UM... I USED TO BE ABLE
TO BLOCK OUT THE FEAR.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.286
BUT EVER SINCE DES WAS BORN,

26:27.286 --> 26:30.289
I'M--I'M ON THAT FIELD,
AND MY HEART STARTS RACING,

26:30.289 --> 26:32.291
AND I CAN'T CATCH MY BREATH.

26:32.291 --> 26:35.965
YOU KNOW, I LOOK AT GUYS
WHO PLAYED THEIR WHOLE CAREERS.

26:35.965 --> 26:37.266
THEY'RE HIT SO MANY TIMES,

26:37.266 --> 26:40.169
THEY CAN BARELY REMEMBER
THEIR OWN NAMES.

26:40.169 --> 26:45.835
AND I'M SCARED HE'S GONNA
GROW UP WITHOUT A DAD.

26:45.835 --> 26:48.207
I'M SCARED ALL THE TIME.

26:48.207 --> 26:51.741
IT'S A NATURAL REACTION.
YOU'RE A FATHER.

26:54.884 --> 26:56.345
WHY DON'T YOU RETIRE?

26:56.345 --> 26:59.048
OH, COME ON. TWO YEARS
INTO A PRO CAREER?

26:59.048 --> 27:00.890
I MEAN, I CAN'T.

27:00.890 --> 27:03.392
I MEAN, I KNOW I'M NOT
A SOLDIER IN IRAQ

27:03.392 --> 27:06.325
OR--OR A ROCKET SCIENTIST
OR ANY KIND OF REAL HERO.

27:06.325 --> 27:10.229
I KNOW I'M JUST SOME BIG,
DUMB JOCK.

27:10.229 --> 27:15.364
BUT I'M A BIG, DUMB JOCK
THE ENTIRE CITY... ROOTS FOR.

27:15.364 --> 27:18.337
KIDS, GUYS ON THE STREET--

27:18.337 --> 27:22.241
I CAN'T LET THEM DOWN.

27:22.241 --> 27:26.375
THIS IS THE TRADE OFF.
I GET HIT.

27:26.375 --> 27:29.949
MM.
SOME GUYS CAN'T EVEN
FEED THEIR FAMILIES, YOU KNOW?

27:29.949 --> 27:33.683
AND SOME GUYS
ARE SOLDIERS IN IRAQ,

27:33.683 --> 27:36.325
AND THEY GET SHOT AT.

27:36.325 --> 27:38.657
SO--SO I'M NOT COMPLAINING.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.730
I'M JUST...

27:40.730 --> 27:44.233
I'M SCARED OF THE HITS.

27:44.233 --> 27:50.169
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER
WHO MY KID IS.

27:57.246 --> 28:00.079
OKAY, NO MORE BUBBLES.

28:00.079 --> 28:02.211
OKAY, PRESSURES ARE GOOD.
LET'S COME OFF.

28:02.211 --> 28:05.154
DECANNULATING.

28:05.154 --> 28:07.686
(Alex) I TOLD TORRES
SHE HAD TO LET YOU SCRUB IN

28:07.686 --> 28:09.688
IF SHE WAS CUTTING.
COOL.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.460
BOOK AN ON-CALL ROOM.

28:11.460 --> 28:15.024
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED
TO DRINKS FIRST?

28:15.024 --> 28:18.798
AH, IT'S KIND OF
A WASTE OF TIME, RIGHT?

28:18.798 --> 28:20.800
