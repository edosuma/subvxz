03:43.265 --> 03:46.064
Third refill costs a nickel.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.026
Tip.

04:31.062 --> 04:34.657
<i>Let's go! On the pass.</i>

04:34.733 --> 04:37.703
<i>Gotcha. Fifteen.
Let's go. Come on!</i>

04:37.778 --> 04:40.076
<i>And raise 10,000.</i>

04:40.155 --> 04:45.412
<i>Twenty-five! Five! Ten!</i>

04:45.494 --> 04:47.872
Come on. Come on.
Fifteen.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.332
Hey, you guys have limits.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.090
High five.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.426
And raise 10,000.

05:00.509 --> 05:04.355
<i>Anybody up?
Twenty-five. Gotcha!</i>

05:04.429 --> 05:06.807
One-seven-five,
one-seven-five left.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.860
<i>Nobody wants to bet
against my hitter here, huh?</i>

05:09.935 --> 05:15.157
Nobody wants to bet? Might as well
sell tickets to the place here.

05:15.232 --> 05:18.452
Three on my side!
I got three. Right.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.655
<i>Ten. I got ten.
Oh, biggies.</i>

05:20.737 --> 05:23.081
<i>- Anybody?
- Fifteen!</i>

05:23.198 --> 05:26.623
I got 30.
Oh, ho. Real spenders we got here.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.045
<i>Real high rollers.</i>

05:29.120 --> 05:31.122
Ah, you had your chance.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.709
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

05:34.793 --> 05:36.545
We're ready over here.

05:36.628 --> 05:39.757
Just remember, anything goes but
no hittin' when somebody's down.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.935
- Yeah.
- Okay. Let 'em go.

05:43.051 --> 05:46.055
You want it? You want it? Yeah? Go get it.
I want it.

05:57.607 --> 06:00.827
Get in there! Get in there!
Hey! Okay, Chuck!

06:19.170 --> 06:21.093
Son of a bitch.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.729
All right.
Come on, Chuck boy. Get him.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.770
Get in there!

06:32.183 --> 06:34.527
<i>Get in there. Get him.</i>

06:34.603 --> 06:37.857
<i>Get in there!</i>

06:37.939 --> 06:40.362
Ohhh!

06:40.483 --> 06:42.201
Go get him!

06:42.277 --> 06:43.745
Come on! Go get him!

06:45.947 --> 06:49.121
You can get him, Chuck!
Come on! Take him now!

06:51.828 --> 06:54.877
Move in on him.
Move in!

07:01.630 --> 07:03.052
Yes! Yes!

07:26.947 --> 07:32.704
<i>Come on. Get up.
Come on. Come on. Get up.</i>

07:32.827 --> 07:35.956
<i>Come on. Come on Get up!
Come on. Get up!</i>

07:40.251 --> 07:42.970
<i>Get up, you chump!</i>

07:50.220 --> 07:53.645
Hey, listen. I think I can
do about six more of those.

07:56.351 --> 07:59.025
Yeah. And a couple
of lemons there.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.556
You can start anytime, pal.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.725
Chaney.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.063
So what?

08:33.138 --> 08:35.390
We could make some money.

08:35.472 --> 08:38.977
Right. Well,
I'm all ears, friend.

08:39.059 --> 08:41.779
That piece of business tonight.
You set it up?

08:41.895 --> 08:44.399
Happens all the time. Help yourself.
Thanks.

08:44.482 --> 08:48.073
Suppose you been down
the long, hard road.

08:48.099 --> 08:49.434
Who hasn't?

08:50.655 --> 08:53.329
<i>Jail?</i>
You a policeman?

08:54.617 --> 08:57.040
Just like to know where men
come from, that's all.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.880
You look a little past it.
Besides, I already got a hitter.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.375
Yeah. Yeah. I saw him.

09:07.401 --> 09:10.205
Aw, son of a bitch laid
down on me tonight.

09:10.258 --> 09:13.432
Look, friend.
Every town's got a bar,

09:13.511 --> 09:16.560
and the bar's got somebody who
thinks he's tough as a nickel steak.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.563
But they all come
to Speed for the do-re-mi.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.020
He's a bum,
I'm the one that loses.

09:24.606 --> 09:27.155
I don't want your dough.

09:28.943 --> 09:32.743
I got six bucks...
and nothin' else.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.792
You bet it.

09:40.288 --> 09:43.212
Well, well, well,
my old friend Speeds back...

09:43.291 --> 09:45.840
with another potential winner.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.468
Anybody want to bet this man?
<i>Not after last night.</i>

09:48.546 --> 09:50.548
Anybody?

09:50.632 --> 09:53.476
<i>I'll give two to one.</i>

09:54.469 --> 09:56.642
Three to one!

09:58.056 --> 10:01.811
Come on! Odds like that
do not come around every day.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.114
Guess you boys aren't
as slow as he is.

10:09.067 --> 10:13.197
Gives us 150 in the pot.
Gonna hold it?

10:13.279 --> 10:16.829
And I got another 1-5-0 for anybody
expects a repeat. What do I hear?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.873
Fifty.
Twenty.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.920
Got it. I'll take it all.
Anybody else?

10:21.037 --> 10:24.883
<i>- You're crazy!
- You got 15 more. You a bettin' man?</i>

10:24.999 --> 10:27.343
<i> Oh, wail a minute.</i>

10:27.418 --> 10:30.797
We got another six.
That's all we got.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.757
<i>I'll take all of it.</i>

10:32.841 --> 10:34.764
I did my part, pal.
He's all yours.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.062
<i>Hey, Pops, you're a little old
for this, ain't ya?</i>

10:37.137 --> 10:40.858
<i>Let's go. Let's go. Get
the fight going. Come on.</i>

11:20.555 --> 11:25.106
Like everything else in this world,
it takes money to make money.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.108
Here's your 12.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.442
Another ten just
to have some fun on.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.652
Work out our official
deal later, huh?

11:33.735 --> 11:36.363
Plenty more
where that came from.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.448
You don't have
to worry about that.

11:38.531 --> 11:43.503
Now.
New Orleans-

11:43.578 --> 11:46.127
Speed's comin' home.
A little taste?

11:48.833 --> 11:51.052
No?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.664
Hello, sugarplum.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.290
How'd it go, Speedy?

12:25.370 --> 12:26.997
Well, a rough start
but a fast finish.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.548
Uh-huh. How much?

12:28.623 --> 12:30.466
Even.
Oh, wonderful.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.090
Always be pleasant
around strangers, honey.

12:33.169 --> 12:37.049
This is Chaney. Gayleen
Schoonover, my permanent fiancée.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.179
I'm pleased to meet you,
Mr. Chaney.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.850
There she is. Let's go.
I'll just say good-bye right here.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.057
Wait a minute, pal.
We got some plans to make.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.143
I wanna feel my way around the city.

12:48.226 --> 12:52.151
- What about our partnership?
- I don't like to rush things.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.198
Jesus Christ!
What are you talking about?

12:54.274 --> 12:57.244
Always be pleasant
around strangers, Speed.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.571
Are we gonna see
you again, Mr. Chaney?

13:00.989 --> 13:02.991
I might turn up.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.788
<i>Don't forget now.
Number 11 Dauphine Street.</i>

13:07.870 --> 13:10.544
Who was that guy?

13:10.623 --> 13:14.673
I'll tell you who he was.
Money on the hoof.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.654
It looks a little rougher
than it really is,

13:33.730 --> 13:36.779
but you get a lot of sun
through that window.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.202
Fix the place up,
could be real nice.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.574
Got some furniture down in the
storage room you could use.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.956
- Nah, I like it the way it is.
- Buck and a half a week.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.002
<i>In advance.</i>

15:09.158 --> 15:11.331
Mind if I sit down?

15:19.794 --> 15:22.923
Would you like to talk or just sit?

15:25.842 --> 15:28.470
What's your name?

15:32.974 --> 15:34.897
Who you waitin' for?

15:34.976 --> 15:39.732
I'm waitin' for somebody to
buy me another cup of coffee.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.782
Have mine.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.290
You live around here?

15:52.326 --> 15:54.420
Didn't take ya long
to get around to that one.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.623
Thought maybe
I could walk you home.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.758
Not likely.

16:04.422 --> 16:07.926
Girl had two choices
in my hometown.

16:08.009 --> 16:12.230
Stay and be bored or move
out and take chances.

16:12.346 --> 16:15.145
How's your luck been runnin'?
How can you ask that?

16:15.224 --> 16:17.192
Look how good I'm livin'.

16:17.268 --> 16:19.236
Well, I've seen worse.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.861
That depends on what
you're looking for.

16:21.981 --> 16:22.886
How 'bout you?

16:22.912 --> 16:25.886
I don't look past the
next bend in the road.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.204
Want me to come in?
No.

16:28.279 --> 16:32.409
- You sure?
- It's not that easy.

16:32.492 --> 16:36.793
I got a husband in jail.
No job and no prospects.

16:36.871 --> 16:41.547
- I wasn't plannin' on botherin' ya.
- Oh? What was your plan?

16:44.212 --> 16:46.306
Maybe I'll see ya around.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.126
Jesus Christ!

17:22.415 --> 17:24.384
Come on. Get up.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.428
Babe!

17:31.634 --> 17:34.433
H-Hey, good to see you, pal.

17:34.512 --> 17:37.015
I'm mighty glad
you found time to stop by.

17:39.141 --> 17:43.567
Come on! Get things started right.
Don't mind Sleepin' Beauty here.

17:43.646 --> 17:46.866
She's not one to rush into the
day's work, are ya? Goddamn it.

17:46.941 --> 17:50.991
We got an important guest here. How 'bout
gettin' up and fixin' breakfast for us?

17:51.070 --> 17:54.665
- Mornin'.
- Christ on a crutch.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.369
Hey, so I suppose you want
to talk deal, huh?

17:59.912 --> 18:04.008
Well, we go 50-50 on all
scratch bets and expenses.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.303
All side bets, I keep 75 percent.
That's how it works.

18:07.378 --> 18:11.633
Sixty-forty in my favor on scratch,
side bets down the middle.

18:13.301 --> 18:16.646
I'm tellin' ya the goin' rate.
What's normal. Ask anybody.

18:16.721 --> 18:19.941
- We'll do things different.
- Why should we?

18:22.018 --> 18:24.817
Because right now, my friend,
you got a percentage of nothin'.

18:24.895 --> 18:29.776
That makes me even with you. I'm puttin'
up all the money. I take all the risks.

18:34.238 --> 18:39.586
All right. All right. All right.
We'll do it your way.

18:39.660 --> 18:45.167
Gayleen! What's a man have to do
to get some breakfast around here?

18:50.171 --> 18:53.345
I got a good feelin' 'bout this.
I think we'll make some real money.

18:53.424 --> 18:58.476
I've got a couple things in mind.
Set something up for you next week.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.933
Go in slow, quiet. Four or five
hundred dollars. Something like that.

19:02.016 --> 19:04.895
There's something I want you to know.
I only come down here to make some money.

19:05.019 --> 19:08.023
Well?
And to fill in some in-betweens.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.027
In-betweens?
Hell, that's no kind of livin'.

19:10.053 --> 19:10.846
Well, it suits me.

19:10.900 --> 19:14.120
When I get enough change
in my pocket, I'm gone.

19:40.930 --> 19:46.482
We just mark this one down to research.
Part of your education.

19:46.560 --> 19:50.736
I wanna have a long talk with
anybody bettin' against me.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.489
Listen. A hundred dollars
against Curly.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.998
- On a marker.
- Uh-uh. No markers.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.831
- Chick, boy, wha-
- Take it.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.341
Who else?

20:09.417 --> 20:12.136
Who's the smoothy over there?

20:13.796 --> 20:18.347
That's Chick Gandil.
One of the big money belts in town.

20:18.426 --> 20:22.021
Son of a bitch has
broken me out three times.

20:23.597 --> 20:26.350
He's the one we're gonna shake.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.703
Anybody?
Last call!

20:37.778 --> 20:40.372
Stay away from him.
Move fast. Jab him.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.256
Ohhh!

21:47.556 --> 21:51.106
Somebody help this kid up.

22:20.089 --> 22:23.719
That's why he's the best.

22:23.801 --> 22:27.476
Nobody ever beats him.
Not many want to try.

What the hell
you doin' back there?

24:16.997 --> 24:20.797
I've always been a student
of comparative religion.

24:20.876 --> 24:24.346
The Pentecostals present
a number of points of interest.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.970
How much dopin' are you doin'?

24:27.049 --> 24:31.771
This month my financial
condition has prevented...

24:31.845 --> 24:34.974
certain journeys
of the imagination.

24:35.057 --> 24:38.732
Good. We're back
in business.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.280
I really got somebody
for us this time.

24:41.355 --> 24:44.609
Chaney, I want you
to meet my old friend, Poe.

24:45.985 --> 24:51.037
Fix up your cuts, bruises-
all sorts of good things.

24:51.115 --> 24:55.211
I have two years of medical
school to recommend me.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.128
Two years doesn't
make a doctor.

24:57.204 --> 25:02.756
Well, in my third year of studies, a
small, black cloud appeared on campus.

25:02.876 --> 25:05.470
I left under it. What he's
tryin' to say is that...

25:05.546 --> 25:07.765
he's a dyed-in-the-wool
hophead.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.717
I have a weakness for opium.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.144
That's a habit
that's hard to quit.

25:12.219 --> 25:16.474
Some are born to fail.
Others have it thrust upon them.

25:16.557 --> 25:18.980
Could I see your hands?

25:21.228 --> 25:25.153
Oh. No protruding
knuckles.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.953
No calcium deposits.
Mm-hmm.

25:30.029 --> 25:33.249
Make a fist. Ooh.

25:33.323 --> 25:37.920
More area to absorb the concussion
of a blow without breaking.

25:37.995 --> 25:40.373
Simple matter
of engineering stress.

25:40.456 --> 25:43.881
Reasonably thick skin.
<i>Oh, he's got good skin.</i>

25:43.959 --> 25:47.509
I'd say there's a good
chance you're not...

25:47.588 --> 25:51.138
what Speed, with an unfortunate turn
of phrase, refers to as "a bleeder."

25:51.258 --> 25:54.512
<i>Like I told you, he's good.</i>
How much?

25:54.595 --> 25:58.225
<i>Ten percent of what we
win, expenses. Standard.</i>

26:15.616 --> 26:18.460
Uh, hi.
Mr. Le Beau here?

26:38.639 --> 26:41.768
I need a, uh, short-termer
for a thousand.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.852
Huh. That's
a heavy taste.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.321
How short?
Oh, a day, maybe two.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.524
I've done business
with you before.

26:48.649 --> 26:52.745
Yeah. 'Bout a year ago.
Mm-hmm.

26:52.820 --> 26:58.623
- Got your money back.
- Yeah. You paid back my $300 all right.

26:58.700 --> 27:01.123
But you had to borrow it
from Abboar to do it.

27:01.203 --> 27:04.127
<i>That one you didn't
cover so well.</i>

27:04.206 --> 27:07.585
- Three weeks over. Big deal.
- It was closer to three months.

27:07.668 --> 27:10.091
Well, he got paid.
What's the difference?

27:12.381 --> 27:15.430
Well, there's a big difference
between me and Abboar.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.684
Well, I'll, uh,
take your word for that.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.060
Okay, Speed.

27:27.437 --> 27:30.281
- That's 950.
- I said a thousand.

27:30.357 --> 27:33.452
That's 50 for the loan.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.825
And 50 for every day
until it comes back.

27:37.531 --> 27:41.502
Whew. Boy, you really
puttin' the Jesse James to me.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.982
Now, you wait here, huh?

28:11.732 --> 28:13.655
Well, how long you gonna be?

28:13.734 --> 28:15.657
'Cause I don't feel like
sittin' out here all day.

28:15.736 --> 28:18.114
Listen. Don't start
complaining now.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.666
Don't you get caught up in any
kind of game in there, Speed.

28:20.741 --> 28:23.540
Business.
It's business.

28:25.954 --> 28:28.082
Give me one.

28:31.084 --> 28:33.052
Well, hello, Speed.
Good seein' you, Chick.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.130
How's my personal pigeon?

28:35.214 --> 28:37.137
Just stopped by
to pay off my marker.

28:37.257 --> 28:41.512
Well, that's all right now.
We all make mistakes.

28:41.595 --> 28:44.474
<i>- Guess you heard about my new hitter?
- I'll see that.</i>

28:44.598 --> 28:47.021
Uh, yeah. Word gets around.
Oh, he's good.

28:47.100 --> 28:47.785
Yeah?

28:47.811 --> 28:50.550
Yeah. Might even work him
up to ape man over there.

28:50.604 --> 28:53.198
Well, now, there's-
there's no mystery about it.

28:53.273 --> 28:56.197
It's my standard deal.
But, uh, you see,

28:56.276 --> 28:58.199
you do have to have
a thousand dollars up front.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.872
You makin' an offer?

29:00.948 --> 29:03.167
Well, my man's just startin' out.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.745
He's good, but I have to get long
odds if I'm gonna face skinhead.

29:05.827 --> 29:11.084
Assuming that you did have the money,
what kind of odds you talkin' about?

29:12.125 --> 29:15.720
- Five to one.
- Three to one.

29:17.965 --> 29:22.391
Deal
Somebody die and leave it to ya?

29:22.469 --> 29:24.563
Three to one, Chickie. Money's
on the table. What do ya say?

29:24.638 --> 29:26.936
You know, I don't like being hustled
by a hope-and-a-prayer artist.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.143
<i>You're not gettin'
in that cheap.</i>

29:29.226 --> 29:32.105
The pot bet just now
went up to three thousand.

29:32.187 --> 29:35.817
<i>Now, you come on back,
when you get that rich.</i>

29:35.899 --> 29:40.405
- You mean to tell me we don't have a deal?
- Not for a thousand.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.541
I'll see you soon, Dempsey.

29:58.005 --> 30:00.929
<i>I'm feelin' quite fine,
Mr. Pettibon. Quite fine.</i>

30:01.008 --> 30:04.808
Well, listen, we got a boy down here I think
could make an interesting contest for you.

30:06.930 --> 30:10.355
Well, now, that's, uh,
quite a bit of money.

30:11.977 --> 30:15.527
I don't know whether our boy's up
to it or not. He's just startin' out.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.653
He's, uh, real game.
He's awful green though.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.782
<i>Nobody takes advantage
of you bayou people.</i>

30:23.155 --> 30:27.376
We'll be there, Mr. Pettibon.
Good talkin' with ya.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.793
Told you it'd be a fat one.

30:31.872 --> 30:33.874
Barber-
How high?

30:35.542 --> 30:38.591
Two thousand George Washingtons.
Is that "high” enough for ya?

30:38.712 --> 30:41.135
Gonna pay some bills.
The dun at the door,

30:41.214 --> 30:43.512
the wolf at the gate
shall be held in abeyance.

30:43.633 --> 30:46.477
Mm-hmm.
You're that sure of Mr. Chaney.

30:46.553 --> 30:49.727
Su- Does a goose go barefoot?

30:51.141 --> 30:53.314
I'm goin' to get some cigars.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.925
Oh, Mr. Pettibon.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.719
Good to see you
again, Mr. Weed.

32:01.795 --> 32:03.843
Ah, look what we did
for your little visit.

32:03.964 --> 32:06.558
Well, this is mighty fine, mighty fine.
I knew you'd like it.

32:06.633 --> 32:10.513
Ah, this is my fiancée,
Miss Gayleen Schoonover.

32:10.637 --> 32:12.890
Well, how do, ma'am?
Pleasure, Mr. Pettibon.

32:12.973 --> 32:15.021
And, you remember
Mr. Poe here.

32:15.100 --> 32:18.855
O-Oh, sure, Mr. Poe.
Nice to see you again, sir.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.031
And that's Chaney.

32:21.148 --> 32:25.528
<i>- He don't say much.
- They's got a plan.</i>

32:25.610 --> 32:28.489
<i>He ain't gonna say
much at all later.</i>

32:30.323 --> 32:33.577
That's your plan,
Mr. Pettibon, not ours.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.083
Oh, now, now,
you said he was green.

32:36.163 --> 32:39.087
What?
Third time out.

32:40.333 --> 32:44.383
Well, he don't
look unpicked to me.

32:45.672 --> 32:50.428
I guess I'll let my man be the judge
of that. That's him right over there.

32:53.263 --> 32:57.188
He looks like he's
up to the mark.

32:57.267 --> 33:00.862
He'd better be.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.188
Goddamn!

34:27.940 --> 34:30.069
Aw, hell!

34:32.362 --> 34:34.989
Very pretty. Very nice.
You better get the money.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.952
Oh, listen. Nobody ever has
to tell me to do that.

34:42.621 --> 34:45.216
Well, that's how
it's done, Mr. Pettibon.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.795
I guess it just wasn't
your day, was it?

34:47.918 --> 34:51.344
Damn small question about that.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.433
What the hell you doin'?

34:57.512 --> 35:02.769
Well, now, this has been
a big setback for us.

35:02.851 --> 35:06.572
<i>I didn't think anybody could
go through my man that way.</i>

35:06.646 --> 35:09.320
It's obviously an error in judgment
on your part then, wasn't it?

35:09.399 --> 35:12.278
It was too damned easy.

35:12.360 --> 35:17.082
There ain't no rules about that, except
who wins. Now, that money's ours.

35:17.157 --> 35:19.251
Somethin' wrong, Speed?

35:19.326 --> 35:23.547
Yeah. We got us a problem.
You're a ringer, Mr. Chaney.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.461
You give us our goddamn money!

35:25.540 --> 35:30.091
You want that money?
Take it.

35:30.170 --> 35:33.549
Somebody always
shows up with a gun.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.306
Goddamn sack of country shit.

35:36.384 --> 35:39.763
Steady on, Speed.
These boys are not refined.

35:39.846 --> 35:45.273
I think you folks better get in your
car and just drive right on home.

35:45.393 --> 35:49.068
I think that's pretty good advice.
There's a man makes some sense.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.900
- He ain't gonna pay.
- Just okay?

35:51.983 --> 35:55.988
Listen, goddamn it! Next time I
come back to this coon-ass place,

35:56.112 --> 35:58.206
I'm gonna bring a gun.
<i>Well, you do that.</i>

35:58.281 --> 36:00.409
Make sure it's a great big one.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.877
<i>Now, get on out!</i>

36:03.870 --> 36:09.468
That's how it's done.

36:24.307 --> 36:28.858
Sorry spectacle.

36:28.937 --> 36:33.033
Very poor example
of Southern sportsmanship.

36:34.651 --> 36:39.703
All this drivin' for nothin'.
My God, it breaks your heart.

36:39.781 --> 36:42.079
Breaks my butt,
that's what it breaks.

36:45.203 --> 36:48.377
Why don't we take it easy and drive
around the backcountry roads...

36:48.456 --> 36:51.630
and see the sights for a while?

36:51.710 --> 36:53.929
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

36:55.255 --> 36:57.178
Business.

37:19.946 --> 37:24.952
Well, anyway, he went through L.J.
just like that. Nothin' to it.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.256
<i>Anybody see that?</i>

37:34.335 --> 37:35.712
<i>- My goodness!
- Jesus Christ.</i>

37:41.968 --> 37:45.063
- Now I got the gun.
- I guess you do.

37:58.902 --> 38:00.825
Anybody else?

38:02.155 --> 38:03.907
What about you?

38:18.546 --> 38:21.470
I don't think
you want to use it.

38:28.556 --> 38:31.309
That's one way.
You want to see another?

38:45.532 --> 38:47.500
Gayleen!

38:47.617 --> 38:50.962
This your place, Pettibon?

39:11.140 --> 39:13.484
<i>He's tearing the place up.</i>

39:14.561 --> 39:16.814
<i>Whee.</i>

39:26.489 --> 39:29.242
Ooh.

39:37.417 --> 39:41.172
Come on back here! Where y'all goin'?
Come here! Come here!

40:12.076 --> 40:14.295
Is this where you live?

40:15.371 --> 40:17.544
I'll see ya
in a couple of days.

40:17.624 --> 40:22.596
- You know who we're goin' after next?
- Yeah.

40:22.670 --> 40:26.391
If this isn't your place,
who's the lucky lady? Hey.

40:26.466 --> 40:29.640
Y'all have a real
big time now, you hear?

40:55.662 --> 40:59.337
<i>Who is it?</i>
Chaney.

41:02.710 --> 41:05.008
What do you want?

41:05.088 --> 41:08.262
Thought maybe you'd
like to come out.

41:08.341 --> 41:11.345
You'd treat me to a champagne
breakfast or somethin'?

41:13.346 --> 41:15.519
Whatever you feel like.

41:16.599 --> 41:20.103
You know, it's 5:00 a.m.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.154
Christ, I barely know you.

41:24.065 --> 41:26.193
Yeah, but would you like to?

41:28.987 --> 41:31.331
I guess I can make
you some coffee.

41:46.045 --> 41:49.595
You haven't gotten around
to tellin' me what you do.

41:51.801 --> 41:53.895
Well, it's somethin'
people generally ask.

41:55.430 --> 41:58.309
You worried I can't pay the check?
No.

41:58.391 --> 42:00.985
I'm worried because you never
answer any questions.

42:01.060 --> 42:04.314
Now, tell me.
How do you make money?

42:06.899 --> 42:09.027
I knock people down.

42:12.739 --> 42:15.333
You mean like a prizefighter?

42:15.408 --> 42:20.460
No. They're pickup fights.
The money's made on bets.

42:20.538 --> 42:23.587
And it's something
I'm doin' just for a while.

42:24.876 --> 42:27.345
Funny way to make a livin'.

42:29.797 --> 42:33.427
It's better than workin' at the bus station
changin' tires for two bucks a day.

42:35.428 --> 42:38.773
What does it feel like
to knock somebody down?

42:40.975 --> 42:44.275
It makes me feel a hell of a
lot better than it does him.

42:45.354 --> 42:47.698
That's a reason?

42:49.609 --> 42:55.287
Hey, there's no reasons
about it. Just money.

43:20.973 --> 43:22.896
<i>Hello, Chick!</i>

43:23.017 --> 43:25.691
Good to see you. How's tricks?
This is a private gatherin'.

43:25.812 --> 43:29.282
I don't believe you gentlemen were invited.
No. You remember Mr. Poe here.

43:29.398 --> 43:32.652
Mr. Poe. Mr. Gandil.
This is gonna take one minute.

43:32.735 --> 43:37.457
Now, you remember those special numbers
you quoted me on, that three to one?

43:37.532 --> 43:39.785
I'm gonna take you up
on that bet.

43:39.867 --> 43:44.338
First you got to have
3,000 real whole dollars.

43:44.413 --> 43:47.587
Otherwise, it's just
an academic question.

43:54.006 --> 43:56.134
You wanna count it?

43:58.427 --> 44:00.145
Okay. You're on.

44:22.243 --> 44:25.122
Howdy, Doty.

44:25.204 --> 44:27.206
Speed.

44:32.336 --> 44:35.055
You know, we haven't been
seeing you around town.

44:35.131 --> 44:37.179
Yeah.
Well, I been busy.

44:37.258 --> 44:40.353
You don't have
anything in the eighth.

44:40.428 --> 44:44.478
Man who can afford a shoeshine sure
ought to be able to pay his debts.

44:44.557 --> 44:48.437
Well, I got to
keep up appearances, huh?

44:53.774 --> 44:57.654
Way we figure it,
you're overdue.

44:57.737 --> 44:59.660
Overdue for what?

44:59.739 --> 45:03.585
You pushin' me, Doty?
You'll get your money.

45:03.659 --> 45:06.208
Sure we will.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.380
I got $200 I'll lay on you right now.
How's that?

45:11.459 --> 45:13.803
Hmm?

45:16.422 --> 45:18.675
Steal it.

45:18.758 --> 45:20.260
Sell your sister.

45:20.885 --> 45:23.058
Borrow it.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.557
But get it all.
Yeah, well-

45:26.682 --> 45:30.277
Now!
Well, I need some time.

45:30.353 --> 45:33.027
Couple of days.

45:33.105 --> 45:35.858
No. Two days. Couple of days.
I got- I got everythin' workin'.

45:35.942 --> 45:38.195
Come on.
Two days.

45:40.738 --> 45:44.743
Better be a promise.
You can bank on that.

48:14.433 --> 48:19.189
Has been a few unfortunate fighters busted
their knuckles on that hard head of his.

48:25.611 --> 48:29.206
Bets in. Time!
All bets in!

48:32.368 --> 48:35.542
Hey, old man.
I'm gonna end it for ya.

48:35.621 --> 48:38.420
Just keep smilin', Big Jim,
while you still got some lips.

48:38.499 --> 48:41.878
When I get done with him,
I'm comin' after you, big shot.

48:41.961 --> 48:44.635
The only thing you gonna
be comin' after is a doctor.

48:46.382 --> 48:50.103
Jesus, I just saw it over there.
$9,000 in a man's hand.

48:50.177 --> 48:53.101
Whew- Enough
to take your breath away.

48:53.180 --> 48:55.274
Start 'em.
Get 'em goin'.

48:55.349 --> 48:58.398
- You okay?
- We're ready over here!

49:51.405 --> 49:53.157
Whoo-o-o.

50:43.249 --> 50:46.048
Come on, Chaney.
Goddamn it.

50:53.133 --> 50:55.682
Oh.

50:55.761 --> 50:57.183
Yeah!

51:02.851 --> 51:03.943
Go get him!

51:06.564 --> 51:08.942
Hey, you're pretty good.

51:54.403 --> 51:55.450
Yeah!

52:10.377 --> 52:12.175
That's it!

52:41.867 --> 52:42.834
Yes!

53:03.555 --> 53:07.185
Whoo-o-o-
Goddamn!

53:21.281 --> 53:25.127
My, my, my, my, my! Look at that
lying there like a dead man.

53:25.202 --> 53:27.375
Hardly know whether to call
for an ambulance or a hearse.

53:27.454 --> 53:30.003
<i>On second thought, let's
get a wheelbarrow in here...</i>

53:30.082 --> 53:32.926
and haul Mr. Gandil's
hitter out.

53:37.965 --> 53:41.845
You've always had an unfortunate
way of puttin' things, Speed.

53:41.927 --> 53:44.271
Nothin' personal, Chick.

53:53.605 --> 53:56.779
Look at that.

54:03.282 --> 54:05.956
All right. All right.
Stand- Come on.

54:06.034 --> 54:09.629
Let him through. Let him through.
Goddamn. Come on now.

54:33.645 --> 54:35.568
Hey, Chaney!

54:37.649 --> 54:40.402
Hey, listen. I got a message from
our old friend, Chick Gandil.

54:40.486 --> 54:42.580
He wants us to come up
and have a drink with him.

54:42.654 --> 54:45.407
You handle it.
I'm not interested.

54:45.491 --> 54:47.493
Oh, now, he said "us.”

54:48.577 --> 54:50.750
<i>Never hurt anybody</i>
<i>to be polite.</i>

55:05.302 --> 55:07.270
Yeah!

55:07.346 --> 55:11.692
Oh, I saw you out there.
Smooth, real smooth.

55:11.767 --> 55:14.691
Thank you. Thank you. It's all
in the partner that you have.

55:14.812 --> 55:16.689
A-Ah, yes.
Thank you.

55:17.815 --> 55:19.943
I would like
to propose a toast.

55:23.362 --> 55:27.117
I propose a toast
to the... best man I know.

55:27.199 --> 55:30.499
To the Napoleon of Southern sports.

55:30.619 --> 55:34.374
Me.
Speed. Speed.

55:36.542 --> 55:39.136
Come on, Gayleen. Let's get
with those galloping dominoes.

55:39.211 --> 55:41.589
We'll see you all later. Have
a good time now. Okay, Poe?

55:41.713 --> 55:45.058
Come on, honey.

55:48.345 --> 55:54.443
I assume you realize that the blood of the
fabled Edgar Allan courses through my veins.

55:54.560 --> 55:57.911
No. But it sure sounds like
I'm gonna hear about it.

55:57.937 --> 55:59.011
Yes.

56:02.651 --> 56:04.824
"Hear the sledges
with the bells.

56:04.903 --> 56:06.826
<i>"Silver bells.</i>

56:06.905 --> 56:11.581
"How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle
in the icy air of night.

56:11.660 --> 56:14.630
"While the stars,
that over-sprinkle-

56:14.705 --> 56:17.083
"All the heavens,
seem to twinkle...

56:17.165 --> 56:19.213
with a crystalline delight.”

56:27.259 --> 56:29.102
<i>Hey, come on here.
All right.</i>

56:29.177 --> 56:31.225
Get the whole 400 for the line.

56:31.305 --> 56:33.353
Get 'em over here.

56:33.432 --> 56:36.402
Don't give me a short
count now, okay?

56:36.476 --> 56:38.899
- Come on, dice!
<i>- Snake eyes!</i>

56:38.979 --> 56:40.526
Son of a bitch!

56:41.982 --> 56:45.612
All right, pass the dice. He's through.
Not yet, pal.

56:45.694 --> 56:48.789
Shoot it all.
Okay.

56:48.864 --> 56:51.788
Bet it all.

56:51.867 --> 56:54.040
Come on, nine!

56:54.119 --> 56:56.372
<i>Point six.</i>

56:56.455 --> 57:00.050
Everything in there?
Come on!

57:00.125 --> 57:01.877
<i>All right!</i>

57:01.960 --> 57:04.054
Six is the point.

57:04.129 --> 57:06.382
<i>Come on. Make that six.</i>

57:06.465 --> 57:08.968
<i>All right. I'm lookin' for a big
pair of threes. Come on!</i>

57:10.802 --> 57:14.727
Lose.
Next lucky roller.

57:16.850 --> 57:19.694
Get your goddamn hat and coat.
You lost all of it.

57:19.811 --> 57:24.567
Shut up.
What? Excuse me, Mr. High Roller.

57:24.650 --> 57:26.652
I should have known.

57:29.112 --> 57:31.615
Sure has been a lot of fun, pal.

57:42.334 --> 57:44.428
How long an arm has he got?

57:44.503 --> 57:46.471
Gandil's a businessman.

57:46.546 --> 57:51.302
Worried about his reputation.
He's not gonna try any muscle play.

57:51.385 --> 57:56.937
There is one thing we are gonna
have to live with though.

57:57.015 --> 58:00.485
Since you beat old
Jim Henry like that,

58:00.560 --> 58:03.188
fights are gonna be
harder to find,

58:03.271 --> 58:07.367
and we are gonna have to give odds,
which can be very expensive.

58:58.118 --> 59:03.500
Would you tell Gandil that Mr. Chaney and
Mr. Weed are here to see him, please?

59:03.623 --> 59:08.049
Just go right on in.
Thank you, ma'am.

59:08.128 --> 59:12.474
How's your jaw, glass man, hmm?

59:16.219 --> 59:18.847
Well, I'm glad you
could drop by, Speed.

59:18.930 --> 59:23.436
Always a pleasure. You
remember Mr. Chaney here.

59:25.479 --> 59:30.030
Well, sit down. Get comfortable.
Thank you.

59:30.108 --> 59:32.702
You, uh, care for a drink?
No, no, no.

59:32.778 --> 59:34.701
Too early for me.
Thank you.

59:34.780 --> 59:39.752
All business, huh?
That's right. Well, let's have it.

59:39.826 --> 59:42.420
You got a direct way of speakin'.

59:42.496 --> 59:44.419
Don't let it upset ya, Chick.

59:44.498 --> 59:46.717
I like a man that's direct.

59:46.792 --> 59:51.218
Makes everything easy to understand,
like the old days.

59:51.296 --> 59:55.221
Chick, we didn't come down here
for no history lesson.

59:55.300 --> 59:57.302
Let's get down to cases.

59:57.385 --> 01:00:00.810
Maybe we should at that.

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:04.735
There's $5,000 in that envelope.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:08.105
It's yours.

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:12.492
I don't believe I'm followin' the drift.

01:00:12.567 --> 01:00:15.662
I'm buyin' half of Chaney.

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:20.417
You talk to me, not him.

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:34.511
I used to have the best street fighter
in this city. Now I don't.

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:36.683
I don't like that at all.

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:46.860
We can get along without you.

01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:57.116
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Chaney.

01:00:57.195 --> 01:00:59.618
I hope you come around
to my way of thinkin'.

01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:21.728
Well, hell!
Look who's here.

01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:26.604
Speed, you come to your Mama Lois's
to have a really good time.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:28.685
Oh, I sure did, Mama.

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:33.361
I got myself some lovely new girls.
Let's go have a look.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.990
Girls, girls!

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:41.699
Now, Speed, each one has been especially
trained to suit your fancy.

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:46.002
I don't need no sales pitch.
I just come to get my hat blocked.

01:01:52.584 --> 01:01:58.091
Well, how about havin' a drink, mister?
Sure. Bourbon.

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:09.856
What'd you say your name was?
Carol.

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:14.238
Carol.

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:20.533
What'd you think about that, Carol?

01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:28.291
Hey, it was terrific.
You were really great.

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:34.092
You know something?

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:39.594
That's just exactly what
I thought you'd say.

01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:03.913
What the hell are you doin'?
Hey, Doty!

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:06.287
<i>Come on!
Hey! Ow!</i>

01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:11.542
No! Don't.
Don't, please-

01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:15.167
Is that okay, Doty?
Talk to him.

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:20.426
Mr. Le Beau says he's got
some business with you.

01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:24.430
He don't want no trouble,
just you pay your debts.

01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:27.850
Uh-huh.

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:32.017
Okay, mister.

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:24.327
Well, good seein' you gentlemen.
Likewise, Speed.

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:27.906
We got a few things to talk about,

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:30.083
<i>a couple of problems.</i>

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:36.415
Well, I gotta get somethin'
goin' in a hurry now.

01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:39.627
Been thinkin' about Gandil.

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:43.509
Maybe we should reconsider
that offer he made us.

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:45.966
Why the change of mind?

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:50.054
I'm flat-ass broke.
I need some money fast.

01:04:50.136 --> 01:04:53.060
I don't like Gandil.

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.517
That's no reason.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.649
That's enough reason for me.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:02.824
Well, that's fine for you, but it doesn't
do much for my case, does it?

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:07.826
I mean, if we don't go with Gandil,
it means I have to borrow.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:10.874
My credit's not worth a
damn all over town.

01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:13.873
Can you loan me $2,000?
That's what I need.

01:05:13.952 --> 01:05:18.958
Speed, you made as much
as me, dollar for dollar.

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:23.963
Well, the way I look at it,
you owe me.

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:28.179
We used my bankroll to begin with,

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:30.226
my money, my contacts!

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:34.226
<i>You were a bum when I met you,
and you're nothin' without me.</i>

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:36.558
Yeah, I figure you owe me.

01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:46.450
Dumb.

01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:49.405
You sayin' no to me?

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.996
Aw, Speed!
Chaney!

01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:09.015
Aw, hell, Speed, now we're both finished.

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:12.537
Welcome to New Orleans, Street.

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:19.410
I don't do that.

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:36.894
You ever get scared when
you do your work?

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:39.689
I don't think about it.

01:07:39.764 --> 01:07:44.190
The only thing you care
about is the money.

01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:47.773
Isn't that right?
Just so the money's good.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:51.944
You got any more questions?

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:58.458
Try this one.
Are you gonna stay the night?

01:08:00.034 --> 01:08:02.128
Not this time.

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:16.680
All right.
Let's get it out.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:19.638
What's botherin' ya?

01:08:24.392 --> 01:08:28.147
Hell, yes, somethings wrong,
a lot of things.

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:31.108
The rent, price of groceries,

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:35.912
clothes I can't buy,
a few items like that.

01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:38.081
How much do you want?

01:08:38.156 --> 01:08:42.411
I want my own.
I don't wanna depend on you.

01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:44.916
<i>You're not reliable.</i>

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:48.671
You come when you want.
You go when you want.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:52.630
And you never mention
what comes in the middle.

01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:57.515
Suit yourself.

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:27.872
Can I buy ya one?

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:32.756
How you been?

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:40.184
You, uh- You wanna talk
about the sportin' life?

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:44.555
I'm out of it.
That's too bad.

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:48.984
I had to give up on you. Went out
and bought myself another hitter.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.983
The best.

01:09:54.232 --> 01:09:57.236
Must make you very happy
now that you got what you wanted.

01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:59.741
I'll tell you what I want.

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:04.622
You must have quite a stash saved
away by now. How about 5,000?

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:09.213
Him against you.
Don't need any more money.

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:13.293
There's no point in avoiding
this thing, you know.

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:16.801
It's gonna happen.
He's right.

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:19.595
You want it that much?
I'm getting paid.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:25.059
I can always reach over
and start things right now.

01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:27.891
Yeah, but you won't.

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:29.772
You don't think so?

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:36.612
You're not gonna do it for free.

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:05.895
Who the hell are you?

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:07.893
Hey! Hey!

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:16.949
Ouch! Son of a bitch! Help!

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:25.578
Hey.
 This is your lucky night.

01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:28.125
That depends on how you look at it.

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:31.250
Well, I'll tell you how to look at it.

01:11:31.329 --> 01:11:35.379
Right about now, I'd be deciding
whether to bust your legs or your back.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:40.134
But, urn, somebody just paid
the interest on your debt.

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:42.307
Just for one week.

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:47.975
Your man fights Mr. Street here, and
I'll handle your home mortgage.

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:52.651
My man? He won't even
speak to me, Chick.

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:55.228
We're gonna put you on ice for a while...

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:58.861
and, uh, see if maybe
he'll speak to me.

01:12:34.642 --> 01:12:38.192
I don't wanna
interrupt anything.

01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:44.119
Gandil come to see me.
We have got a problem.

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:47.580
You and me ain't got no trouble, Poe.
I'm afraid we do.

01:12:47.655 --> 01:12:49.783
It's about our old friend Speed.

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:52.330
He send you?
Don't even know I'm here.

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:56.415
Me and Speed ain't
related anymore.

01:12:56.497 --> 01:13:00.718
Things don't work that easy.
He's in a lot of trouble.

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:02.010
I ain't interested.

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:06.307
Speed owes a ton
to one of our local riffraff.

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:08.384
They're puttin' the arm on him.

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:12.347
Gandil's gonna pay the loan
off if you take on his man.

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:14.933
No crowd, just business.

01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:18.065
You want me to bet my $5,000.
That's all the money I got.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:20.522
I don't owe that goddamn
Speed nothin'.

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:24.451
That's not the point.
It's real simple.

01:13:24.525 --> 01:13:29.201
He's in the ringer.
You're the only one that can get him out.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.124
Money's hard to come by, Poe.

01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:38.081
<i>Somebody got a cigarette?</i>

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:41.259
I don't use any.

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:44.087
Of course, I'd be happy
to go down and get some.

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:46.593
You're not goin' anywhere.

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:50.719
Listen, things don't work out tomorrow
night, which one of you gets to do the job?

01:13:50.801 --> 01:13:53.645
We both do.

01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:58.147
Mm-mmm, not this time.
I'll take him.

01:14:01.479 --> 01:14:04.483
That's right. You haven't won
one in a while, have you, Jim?

01:14:06.651 --> 01:14:11.999
Three cards. He really
cleaned your plow, didn't he?

01:14:12.073 --> 01:14:15.122
Why don't you shut up
and play cards?

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:32.393
<i>- Think he's gonna show up?
- Sure hope not.</i>

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:44.196
I've got a visitor.

01:14:45.523 --> 01:14:50.029
Some other time.
Uh, no, wait.

01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:52.660
I'll walk you down.

01:15:14.552 --> 01:15:16.771
Well, how you been?

01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:20.937
How do I look?
I got no complaints.

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:24.692
There's somethin' I gotta tell you.

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:27.865
I don't think you should
drop by anymore.

01:15:30.067 --> 01:15:32.195
Things have changed.

01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:36.453
I think I'm movin'.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:39.706
I'm gonna get a better place.

01:15:41.078 --> 01:15:43.547
I got a better offer.

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:47.339
Someone that spends the night.

01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:51.552
He's even got a steady job.

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:58.183
Looks like you got
things all figured out.

01:15:58.262 --> 01:16:01.266
Is that all you've got to say?

01:16:44.642 --> 01:16:46.610
Gentlemen.

01:16:46.685 --> 01:16:52.408
Evenin'.
Your man gonna show up?

01:16:52.483 --> 01:16:55.987
We just have to wait and find out.

01:19:33.352 --> 01:19:35.320
Let's get started.

01:19:35.396 --> 01:19:38.400
Why not?

01:19:39.733 --> 01:19:44.409
Where are they?
Upstairs. Uh, go up and get 'em-

01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:46.707
I'll do it!

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.188
We're not gonna wait here all night!

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.844
Thanks, pal.

01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:54.309
Just like old times, huh?
We did add a couple of new wrinkles.

01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:56.189
Ever see him fight?

01:20:57.436 --> 01:20:59.655
No, I can't say
I've had the pleasure.

01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:02.654
But they didn't bring him down all
the way from Chicago to lose.

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:04.656
Let's do it.

01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:08.160
All right, you pissant big shots,
we're ready over here.

01:21:08.238 --> 01:21:10.332
All right, anybody else
got anything to say?

01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:12.250
Glad you could make it.

01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:15.829
Things have a way of comin' around.

01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:24.346
You know, Mr. Chaney, I envy you.

01:21:24.421 --> 01:21:28.767
<i>Must be excitin' to bet more money
than you can afford to lose.</i>

01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:34.394
What?

01:21:34.473 --> 01:21:36.225
Who's gonna hold it?

01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:40.191
He is.

01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:49.865
It doesn't matter what you do.
You're always gonna smell like fish.

01:23:04.146 --> 01:23:06.990
That got him.

01:23:32.174 --> 01:23:34.176
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:25:03.015 --> 01:25:05.313
<i>Come on.</i>

01:26:04.701 --> 01:26:06.829
Use 'em.

01:26:06.912 --> 01:26:09.961
- Foul! Get those palmers out of here.
- Use 'em!

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.793
- Goddamn it! Use 'em!
- Forfeit! Forfeit!

01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:15.675
<i>By God!</i>

01:27:20.986 --> 01:27:22.784
You owe me money.

01:27:26.867 --> 01:27:29.290
You know, you cost me a great deal.

01:27:30.829 --> 01:27:32.877
You'll live with it.

01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:41.549
Mr. Chaney, it's been
a pleasure watchin' you work.

01:27:43.633 --> 01:27:47.979
Well, you know, Chick,
like old mama said,

01:27:48.054 --> 01:27:50.898
"Next best thing to
playin' and winnin'-

01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:53.944
Is playin' and losin'."

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:57.655
I'll see you around.
Adios.

01:28:42.692 --> 01:28:45.286
Sure this is far as you wanna go?

01:28:45.362 --> 01:28:47.990
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:28:49.533 --> 01:28:52.207
Hey, Poe.

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:56.381
I got a cat back at my place.

01:28:57.707 --> 01:28:59.960
I want you to take care of it for me.

01:29:01.461 --> 01:29:03.714
That's a lot of money.

01:29:05.465 --> 01:29:07.138
You take care of Poe.

01:29:10.262 --> 01:29:13.266
For a man who came to town
to make some money,

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:15.396
you're sure givin' a lot of it away.

01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:18.900
You're forgetting about the in-betweens.

01:29:21.731 --> 01:29:23.984
Yeah, I guess you filled
them out all right.

01:29:28.738 --> 01:29:32.288
Uh, well, where are you off to?

01:29:35.662 --> 01:29:37.505
North.

01:29:37.581 --> 01:29:40.084
Well, Chaney?

01:29:45.922 --> 01:29:47.765
We ought to say somethin'.

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:12.999
Maybe we ought to head
on down to Miami.

01:30:14.826 --> 01:30:18.330
Get into some of that
action down there, huh?

01:30:19.706 --> 01:30:22.175
It's a hell of a town,
you know.

01:30:29.132 --> 01:30:32.136
Right on that warm oceanfront.

01:30:33.595 --> 01:30:37.771
Fine salt sea air.

01:30:37.849 --> 01:30:40.068
Be good for our health.

01:30:40.143 --> 01:30:42.066
Uh-huh.

01:30:43.563 --> 01:30:45.986
Oh, he sure was somethin'.

01:30:48.485 --> 01:30:50.658
Let's go get the cat.

01:30:52.322 --> 01:30:55.166
Yeah.
