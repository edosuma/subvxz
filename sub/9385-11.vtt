Oh, let's see. We've got soda,
purple stuff...

00:37.079 --> 00:38.789
Oh! Sunny D! All right!

00:41.124 --> 00:43.085
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return
to The Smurfs.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.421
-Hey. You have a good time last night?
-Smurftacular!

00:46.505 --> 00:48.048
Yeah, I saw you leave with Smurfette.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.843
Oh, man. As soon as we got out of
the bar she startedsmurfin' me.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.386
-Shut the smurf up!
-Yeah!

00:52.469 --> 00:53.929
Right in the smurfin' parking lot?

00:54.012 --> 00:56.682
-Smurf, yeah!
-That is freakin' smurf!

00:56.765 --> 00:58.976
-You smurf it. Yeah.
-That is freakin' smurf.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.853
-(phone ringing)
-Hello?

01:00.936 --> 01:02.437
(gasps) Oh, my God!

01:03.522 --> 01:05.858
Peter, why are you staring into the dryer?

01:05.941 --> 01:08.861
I'm watching the latest episode
of Laundry Theatre.

01:08.944 --> 01:11.196
See, now. Those are Chris's socks, right?

01:11.363 --> 01:13.156
Now, they don't know
that Stewie's shirt

01:13.240 --> 01:15.033
is having an affair
with Meg's trousers.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.786
Ooh, it's fun to watch
rich people be naughty!

01:17.870 --> 01:20.163
Peter, listen to me.
My sister just called.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.958
Her baby's due any day now
and Ted just walked out on her.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.627
Whoa, back it up, back it up,
you have a sister?

01:25.711 --> 01:27.921
I promised her I'd be
on the next train.

01:28.005 --> 01:30.799
Poor Carol, all alone
in that big house.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.551
Wait a minute, Carol. Carol...

01:32.634 --> 01:34.761
Uh, she the one with
the jacuzzi and the pool table?

01:34.845 --> 01:36.138
-Yeah.
-I better with you.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.348
Really? That's a surprise.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.393
Oh, come on, Lois. When have
I not been there for you?

01:41.560 --> 01:42.603
(car tires screeching)

01:42.686 --> 01:44.855
-Get outta the car, now!
-Scream and you're dead.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.273
Thanks for the ride, lady.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.238
Hey, it's the Griffins.
What can I do for you?

01:53.322 --> 01:55.490
Glen, we have a family emergency.

01:55.574 --> 01:58.160
We really need you to take
the kids for just a couple of days.

01:58.243 --> 02:02.664
Uh, in accordance with Megan's Law,
I'm obligated to inform you that...

02:02.748 --> 02:04.374
You know what, that's fine.
I'll take the kids.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.918
Aww, thanks, buddy.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.923
Gosh, I never entertained kids before.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.302
So a chick walks into
a gynecologist's office...

02:18.180 --> 02:20.432
Wha-ha-ha-ha-hey!

02:23.477 --> 02:25.812
Diggly, diggly, diggly, diggly!

02:30.734 --> 02:32.778
Don't worry, Carol,
we'll get you through this.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.905
In a few days you'll have
a beautiful baby

02:34.988 --> 02:37.574
and you can smother it
with all your unrequited love.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.702
And as soon as the baby can crawl,
it'll probably leave me too,

02:40.786 --> 02:43.288
(cries) just like my eight husbands.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.375
PETER: (imitating Ted) Hey, Carol.
It's me, Ted.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.378
Listen, uh, I came back
because I love you and...

02:49.461 --> 02:51.421
I'm just kidding. It's me, Peter.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.132
Aww, it was so nice of you
to come, Peter.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.425
You're so considerate.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.927
-Ah, it was nothing.
-(glass shatters)

03:08.397 --> 03:09.940
(glass shatters)

03:10.691 --> 03:13.944
(furniture dragging)

03:17.155 --> 03:19.992
Mr. Quagmire, I finished
the scavenger hunt.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.411
Well, hold your horses, hold your horses.
Let's go down the list.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.913
-Uh, an unsharpened pencil?
-Check.

03:24.997 --> 03:27.374
A speed-limit sign that
doesn't end in five or zero?

03:27.457 --> 03:29.042
-Check!
-Your mom's hairbrush?

03:29.126 --> 03:30.335
-Check!
-You win!

03:30.419 --> 03:32.337
Oh, boy! What's my prize?

03:32.421 --> 03:34.673
- A pencil and a speed sign.
- I did it!

03:34.756 --> 03:35.966
I'll be right back.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.431
A couple of teeth and some
toenail clippings,

03:42.514 --> 03:44.099
and we'll be ready for our date.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.979
PETER: Um, hey, Carol, since Ted
dumped you, can I have his shirts?

03:49.062 --> 03:51.940
Peter, what are you gonna do
with Ted's shirts? He's half your size.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.942
I know, I know, but check this out.

03:54.026 --> 03:58.155
Hey, Carol, say "David Banner,
I just slashed your tires. "

03:58.238 --> 04:02.701
-David Banner, I just slashed your tires.
-Aaagh!

04:04.203 --> 04:05.412
I'm priceless!

04:05.495 --> 04:08.207
Peter, sit with Carol. I'm gonna
use the ladies room.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.209
Does she still take the newspaper
in there?

04:10.292 --> 04:11.335
Ugh, yeah.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.962
And after she does, I just can't read it.

04:14.046 --> 04:19.134
Oh! Oh, God! The baby's gonna be here
any minute. We'd better get moving.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.219
Carol. you gotta relax.

04:20.302 --> 04:23.263
You let that kid start calling
the shots now and you're screwed.

04:25.474 --> 04:28.727
Is Mr. Quagmire baby-sitting
all these people, too?

04:31.313 --> 04:35.317
Hey. If I could rearrange the alphabet,
I'd put U and I together.

04:36.485 --> 04:40.155
You must be a parking ticket,
cos you got "fine" written all over you.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.535
Hey, there. I don't wanna
come between you... or do I?

04:46.036 --> 04:47.996
That's awful. That's awful.

04:48.330 --> 04:52.209
Um, this is a song I've been
singing for a number of years,

04:52.292 --> 04:56.046
and I find it grows truer and truer
as time goes by.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.716
♪♪ Hungry eyes ♪♪

05:01.009 --> 05:05.472
♪♪ I feel the magic
Between You and I ♪♪

05:05.556 --> 05:07.182
Ooh, I'm hungry for you, baby.

05:07.266 --> 05:08.767
Come on, walk with me, talk with me.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.274
(gasps)

05:16.316 --> 05:18.318
Don't worry, Carol. We're almost there.

05:18.402 --> 05:19.653
Peter, why are we stopped?

05:19.736 --> 05:21.864
Um, yeah, I'll have three cheeseburgers.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.199
Peter, for God's sake,
she's having a baby!

05:24.283 --> 05:29.705
Oh, that's right. And a kid's meal.
And, uh, I guess I'll have fries.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.583
I... If I have fries,
is anybody else gonna have any?

05:32.666 --> 05:34.585
'Cause you know, I don't wanna be
the only one eating 'em.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.919
I'll feel like a fatty.

05:38.839 --> 05:42.718
-Nurse, this woman is in labor.
-Excuse me. I was here first.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.428
My leg is asleep.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.512
Oh!

05:45.596 --> 05:47.264
All right, let's see what we have here.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.141
Oh, the baby's crowning.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.101
Oh!

05:51.185 --> 05:53.353
All right, I'm just going
to put on a pair of gloves

05:53.437 --> 05:54.813
and we'll deliver this baby.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.733
These don't feel like gloves at all.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.610
They feel like used needles.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.820
But this is where I always
keep the gloves.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.031
Uh, maybe if I dig deeper.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.658
No, just feels like more needles.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.493
That's the craziest thing.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.163
Oh. Now I'm sure this
isn't the glove drawer.

06:11.246 --> 06:14.041
Oh, my God! Who's gonna
deliver my baby?

06:14.124 --> 06:15.501
Honey, do something!

06:16.376 --> 06:18.921
No baby, but it looks like
Carol's blowing a bubble.

06:19.004 --> 06:23.008
-Peter, that's the head. Push! Push!
-I am! It won't go back in.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.969
Not you, Peter. Carol, push.
Peter, you pull.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.472
Aagh!

06:28.555 --> 06:31.016
-Oh, my God!
-What? What?

06:31.099 --> 06:33.185
It's a beautiful baby girl.

06:33.268 --> 06:37.064
-A baby girl. I'm so happy!
-(baby crying)

06:37.147 --> 06:40.400
But she has a penis.
We'll have to do something about that.

06:40.484 --> 06:43.946
-Peter, no! It's a boy.
-Well, how do you like that!

06:44.029 --> 06:46.823
Hey there, little fella.
Welcome to the planet Earth!

06:46.907 --> 06:49.034
Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo!

06:50.869 --> 06:52.913
Hey, he takes after his Uncle Peter.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.123
Peter, he's Carol's baby.
Give him to her.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.542
Oh, oh, yeah.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.503
Honey, you were fantastic.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.505
And you were so cute
when you were holding it.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.173
I know. I didn't wanna give it up.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.258
-Yeah?
-Let's steal it.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.552
-What?
-No, wait. I got a better idea.

07:06.635 --> 07:10.013
-Lois, let's have another baby.
-What?

07:10.097 --> 07:12.724
-Sweetie, you're not serious?
-I sure am.

07:12.808 --> 07:15.352
The best thing I've ever done
with my life is being a dad.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.647
Oh, Peter, I think it's a wonderful idea.

07:20.983 --> 07:24.069
Why haven't you sent for help?
(thuds)

07:27.823 --> 07:30.158
I can't believe you guys
wanna have another kid.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.286
Peter, did you find
Chris and Meg's baby books?

07:32.369 --> 07:35.622
No, not yet. Hey, look at this, Lois.
It's our pet rock.

07:35.706 --> 07:38.125
Ah, I remember the first day
we brought it home.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.294
See that? Huh? Huh?

07:40.377 --> 07:42.337
Bad rock! Bad!

07:42.421 --> 07:44.339
We do that outside.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.633
Look at him. He knows what he did.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.969
I found my baby book!

07:49.303 --> 07:52.806
Hey, here's the broken condom
that led to my birth.

07:52.890 --> 07:55.475
And the resulting lawsuit
bought us this house.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.728
You're my favorite mistake.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.689
You see, Meg? I'm the favorite.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.275
Ah, baby books.

08:03.358 --> 08:06.320
Nostalgic for the days
of chafed nipples and episiotomies?

08:06.403 --> 08:10.282
-Oh, somebody hasn't heard the news.
-News? What news?

08:10.365 --> 08:13.243
What's the most wonderful thing
that could happen to this family?

08:13.327 --> 08:14.328
Hmm.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.834
Oh, the Phillies won.

08:20.918 --> 08:23.629
-You're gonna have a baby brother, buddy.
-Or a sister.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.380
Oh, a new baby. That's wonderful.

08:25.464 --> 08:26.924
Call me when Kojak starts.

08:27.758 --> 08:28.759
What?

08:30.427 --> 08:33.305
Another baby? But I'm the baby.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.182
Why the deuce would they
want to replace me?

08:35.432 --> 08:37.851
My cheeks are pinchable,
my bottom is smooth,

08:37.935 --> 08:39.144
my laugh is heart-warming.

08:41.313 --> 08:44.358
What's that? I certainly
am not overreacting.

08:44.483 --> 08:45.817
What the devil do you think
happened to Bobby

08:45.901 --> 08:47.528
when they added Cousin Oliver
to The Brady Bunch?

08:47.945 --> 08:50.155
Oliver, did you break this vase?

08:50.239 --> 08:52.491
-No, the floor did.
-(all laughing)

08:52.574 --> 08:53.992
He's so cute.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.870
-Hey, everybody! I...
-Bobby, you get back in the garage!

08:56.954 --> 08:59.081
Ow! Ow! Ah! Ow!

08:59.289 --> 09:01.500
It can't happen. I was here first.

09:01.959 --> 09:04.044
Well, technically third,
but no time for semantics.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.797
This is Stewie country,
and I intend to keep it that way.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.675
As God is my witness,
from this day forward,

09:09.758 --> 09:12.845
Peter and Lois shall not conceive.

09:13.846 --> 09:14.972
(menacing music)

09:16.974 --> 09:18.559
(gasps)

09:18.642 --> 09:19.768
What are you doing here?

09:19.852 --> 09:22.396
Uh, Peter and Lois are, uh,
getting intimate.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.858
My God, I thought I had more time.
I've got to stop them.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.860
Whaaa! Whaaa!

09:27.943 --> 09:30.070
Mommy, Daddy, I had a bad dream!

09:30.153 --> 09:31.989
I saw the bo...

09:32.072 --> 09:35.701
Blast! What the devil is that name again?
Bo... Bo... Bogeyman! Yes, that's it!

09:35.784 --> 09:39.037
-I saw the bogeyman.
-Aww. Did someone have a bad dream?

09:40.038 --> 09:42.082
Why don't you sleep
with Mommy and Daddy?

09:43.584 --> 09:46.003
Peter, for God's sake.
Stewie's right here.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.089
Come on, Lois. We can still do it.
He'll just think I'm hurtin' ya.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.341
Relax, honey. It's only for tonight.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.593
(clicks switch)

09:53.635 --> 09:55.387
(snoring)

09:56.305 --> 09:59.683
Roll over. Roll over, I say!

09:59.808 --> 10:01.810
(Stewie grunts)

10:01.894 --> 10:03.353
STEWIE: Smells like cheese.

10:05.731 --> 10:09.526
-Okay, insert rod support A into slot B.
-That's what...

10:09.610 --> 10:12.529
If you say "That's what she said"
once more, I'll pop you.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.323
What you buildin', neighbour?

10:14.406 --> 10:17.576
Well, we were keeping it a secret,
but you guys are my best friends,

10:17.659 --> 10:21.496
so I'll tell ya. Lois and I
are having another baby!

10:21.580 --> 10:24.374
(all whooping)

10:24.458 --> 10:27.127
We are so throwing you a shower.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.098
Well, fat man, we'll see if Lois
wants to have sexual relations

10:40.182 --> 10:42.684
when she finds lipstick on your collar.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.730
There we are.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.905
Well, look at you there.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.491
You're a filthy girl, aren't you?

10:57.616 --> 11:01.286
Yes, yes, you're looking for a bad time,
that's what you're after.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.330
You're a dirty flirt.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.415
You want it bad and you don't care
who you get it from,

11:05.541 --> 11:08.627
because you have no self-respect,
and that gets you off, doesn't it?

11:09.294 --> 11:12.965
Stewie! Bad boy! That's Mommy's make-up.

11:13.090 --> 11:16.802
And you got it all over your father's
favorite shirt. Now, go to your room.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.054
Wow. The evidence is really piling up.

11:19.137 --> 11:22.015
Make any joke you want.
You know I look good.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.481
Oh, my God! They're at it again.

11:29.565 --> 11:32.526
Ah, all this time spent
keeping people from having sex!

11:32.609 --> 11:35.737
Now I know how
the Catholic Church feels. Ba-zing!

11:35.863 --> 11:38.156
Time to initiate phase two.

11:43.996 --> 11:47.541
All right, testing voice modulator.
Blast, you vile woman!

11:47.624 --> 11:50.043
-Blast, you vile woman.
-Ugh, that won't do.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.715
Pardon me, you with
severe aesthetic deficiencies.

11:54.840 --> 11:58.051
-Hey, ugly!
-Excellent. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

11:58.135 --> 12:00.095
Sweet. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

12:03.682 --> 12:04.725
Who's got beer?

12:05.100 --> 12:06.101
(gags)

12:06.685 --> 12:08.020
(Peter thuds)

12:08.312 --> 12:13.609
-Where'd you go, my little pumpkin-eater?
-To the can. Kissing you made me barf.

12:13.692 --> 12:16.278
- What?
- Dad, Meg keeps pushing me.

12:16.361 --> 12:20.866
-Oh, like I could! He's so fat.
-I'm not fat. I'm Rubenesque.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.910
That's it. Your dad's had enough.

12:22.993 --> 12:26.622
I want you kids to go and drink
the antifreeze in the garage.

12:26.705 --> 12:29.249
I'm gonna chug it all
so there's none left for you.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.417
Watch it!

12:30.501 --> 12:31.835
-(glass shatters)
-Peter!

12:32.127 --> 12:33.128
What?

12:33.462 --> 12:34.671
Hey, Peter.

12:35.881 --> 12:39.218
I see nussing. Nussing.

12:39.301 --> 12:42.846
I've had it with these interruptions.
All we want is time alone.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.724
Now, you kids go to your rooms
for the rest of the night.

12:45.807 --> 12:50.020
I don't wanna go to my room.
There's an evil monkey in my closet.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.899
Evil monkey! That's funny.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.070
Argh!

12:59.738 --> 13:02.741
This romantic dinner
was a wonderful idea, Peter.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.577
Aww, you deserve it,
my beautiful princess.

13:06.912 --> 13:10.749
You know, I'm not wearing any panties.

13:10.832 --> 13:14.378
Don't worry.
We can always throw that chair out.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.466
(both kissing)

13:27.015 --> 13:29.726
Very well, then. If I can't
stop them from the outside,

13:29.810 --> 13:32.312
I'll stop them from the inside.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.241
(dramatic music)

13:47.035 --> 13:49.788
(buzzing)

13:52.833 --> 13:56.712
Oh, dear. I'm afraid
you're in a no-fly zone.

13:57.212 --> 13:58.297
(beeping)

14:03.468 --> 14:07.139
As was your fate, Mr. Fly,
so is the fate of every sperm

14:07.222 --> 14:08.599
in Peter's body.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.893
STEWIE: Argh!

14:17.441 --> 14:18.442
Computer on.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.986
COMPUTER: 30 minutes
before ship re-expansion.

14:21.111 --> 14:24.948
Uh, just enough time to obliterate
all those little potential usurpers.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.742
-Engine status?
-COMPUTER: Nominal.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.410
-Fuel supply?
-COMPUTER: Full.

14:32.998 --> 14:35.209

14:59.733 --> 15:02.402

15:05.906 --> 15:10.285
COMPUTER: Warning. Host's oxygen levels
rising. Heart rate increasing.

15:10.369 --> 15:14.581
My God. Either they're watching Batman
or they're doing the do.

15:17.584 --> 15:21.505
Hmm. If I'm to reach the testicles
and destroy the sperm before coitus,

15:21.588 --> 15:22.589
I must buy some time.

15:22.881 --> 15:26.885
-Computer, location.
-COMPUTER: 15mm northeast of the duodenum.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.720
Very well. Fire phasers!

15:30.347 --> 15:32.224
Oh, jeez! My duodenum's acting up.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.020
COMPUTER: Entering testicular perimeter.

15:41.859 --> 15:45.571
Well, well. Do you know what today is?

15:45.696 --> 15:48.407
A bad day to be a sperm.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.787
(firing)

16:20.731 --> 16:22.232
(grunts) What the deuce?

16:31.617 --> 16:34.953
-Well, it seems you're out of ammunition.
-As are you, Stewart.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.581
-(gasps) You know my name.
-I know many things.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.082
- Indeed. Yes.
- Quite.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.918
-Hmm.
-Then, perhaps, we should exchange

16:41.001 --> 16:43.128
monosyllabic expressions
of arrogance in person.

16:43.212 --> 16:44.588
-Hm. Yes.
-Mm.

16:48.342 --> 16:52.137
-Peter, I'm waiting.
-PETER: I'm comin'.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.352
(South American dance music playing)

17:07.069 --> 17:09.196
-You came unarmed?
-As we agreed.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.114
Admirable. But foolish!

17:11.490 --> 17:12.699
(firing)

17:15.118 --> 17:18.080
It's going to be a shame
to destroy such a worthy adversary.

17:18.163 --> 17:19.957
My thoughts exactly.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.125
(both grunting)

17:31.426 --> 17:34.888
-I've got you in the sleeper hold.
-As I you. (grunts)

17:34.972 --> 17:37.850
Your attempts to escape are...

17:37.933 --> 17:39.685
Futile.

17:40.477 --> 17:41.520
(both snoring)

17:54.408 --> 17:57.035
Well, well. Nap time appears to be over.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.704
Go ahead. Finish me off.

17:58.787 --> 18:01.206
My one regret is that I won't
be able to do away

18:01.290 --> 18:02.916
with that red-headed woman.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.544
What the...? How the devil
do you know about Lois?

18:05.627 --> 18:09.214
You've seen that little gleam
in the fat man's eye? That twinkle?

18:09.298 --> 18:11.216
That's me, plotting my escape.

18:11.425 --> 18:15.304
You hate Lois? I hate Lois, too.
What else do you hate?

18:15.387 --> 18:18.640
People who send pictures
of their families as Christmas cards.

18:18.724 --> 18:20.726
Ooh, ohh. People who use
the word "guestimate".

18:20.809 --> 18:22.728
Guys who wear sandals with socks.

18:22.811 --> 18:26.315
BOTH: Jason Patric. Ew!

18:26.440 --> 18:29.276
You know, perhaps I've been looking
at this the wrong way.

18:29.526 --> 18:32.362
I dare say, I should embrace the idea
of having a little brother.

18:32.571 --> 18:36.241
After all, it's obvious
we'd make quite a formidable team.

18:39.036 --> 18:40.078
LOIS: Ah!

18:40.412 --> 18:41.455

I'll never get out of here in time.

19:02.643 --> 19:04.353
Move aside. I know a short cut.

19:08.524 --> 19:10.400
Mm.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.907

I think I know just the way.

And I love you, Lou Gossett Junior.

20:07.207 --> 20:10.961
It worked. You've got to get
down there so you can be born.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.130
COMPUTER: 10 seconds to re-expansion.

20:13.213 --> 20:16.133
-I guess this is goodbye.
-For now.

20:16.550 --> 20:20.470
When you're born, don't let the doctor
slap you on the ass. It degrades us all.

20:25.434 --> 20:27.936
(honks)

20:36.570 --> 20:38.530
Give it to her good, old man.

20:38.655 --> 20:41.033
Peter, wait. I've been thinking.

20:41.158 --> 20:44.536
It's been a long time since
we had such a wonderful night.

20:44.620 --> 20:47.623
And it's gonna be impossible
to spend time together like this

20:47.706 --> 20:49.374
if we're raising another child.

20:49.458 --> 20:53.504
Well, I thought, you know,
Brian would do a lot of the work.

20:53.587 --> 20:57.382
I don't know. I mean,
Stewie alone needs so much attention.

20:57.841 --> 21:00.177
Maybe we should hold off
on having another baby.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.221
-(gasps)
-Yeah, you may be right.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.723
No, no, no! You must
receive his seed!

21:04.806 --> 21:09.186
-Look who's here!
-But, Lois, we still get to do it, right?

21:09.269 --> 21:12.981
-Honey, not in front of Stewie.
-Okay. Back in a minute.

21:13.065 --> 21:18.320
No, no, no! Come back here
this instant, you fat bastard, and do her!

21:19.821 --> 21:23.033
Stop! Stop it! Stop tickling me! Stop it!

21:23.116 --> 21:25.577
I'll kill you, I swear to God!

21:33.877 --> 21:36.922

-No!

21:37.005 --> 21:40.259
You killed my brother!
How could you, you...

21:41.468 --> 21:44.555
Oh, my God! The twinkle. He's alive.

21:44.638 --> 21:47.724
Well played, sperm brother. Well played.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.185
He's more clever than I thought.

21:50.811 --> 21:52.563
Perhaps too clever.

21:56.984 --> 21:58.652
(theme music playing)
