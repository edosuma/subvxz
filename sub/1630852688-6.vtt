00:12.240 --> 00:15.479
TURIN, ITALY

00:16.360 --> 00:19.240
FOR MY LOVE WITH LOVE

00:24.680 --> 00:28.959
I spent the last days in Turin
a bit… gloomy.

00:29.639 --> 00:32.159
Because I've been moving stuff
little by little,

00:32.240 --> 00:33.960
just in case I have to leave.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.559
And, you know,
the house doesn't look as full

00:37.640 --> 00:39.040
as when you live in it.

00:42.239 --> 00:43.080
Come on!

00:43.160 --> 00:46.640
The cars are gone.
The garage looks huge, empty.

00:46.720 --> 00:49.360
And empty spaces
in a house look ugly, right?

00:52.800 --> 00:54.199
Only God knows the future.

00:54.279 --> 00:55.320
That's why I'm calm

00:55.400 --> 00:58.919
because I know that regardless
of whether I stay or leave,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.640
it will just be another step
in Cristiano's life.

01:26.000 --> 01:26.839
<i>Gio.</i>

01:26.920 --> 01:28.280
Good morning.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.920
<i> Good morning. How are you?</i>
<i>How are you doing?</i>

01:31.000 --> 01:31.920
Very good.

01:32.839 --> 01:34.880
I'm swimming. It is very hot here.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.640
- <i> Really?</i>
- Yes.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.520
<i>I wanted to tell you</i>
<i>that a very interesting opportunity</i>

01:41.600 --> 01:43.240
<i>for the project came up.</i>

01:43.880 --> 01:44.839
Yes.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.559
<i>We can have a song by J. Balvin.</i>

01:48.440 --> 01:49.520
<i>What do you think?</i>

01:51.000 --> 01:52.479
A dream come true.

01:53.679 --> 01:55.880
- <i> I knew you would like it.</i>
- Awesome.

01:56.520 --> 02:00.080
I met J. Balvin four years ago
at one of Cris's birthday parties.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.800
Cris hired him for a concert at our house.

02:03.440 --> 02:06.720
J. Balvin is wonderful.
He is a close friend.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.160
He's also a hard worker.

02:10.239 --> 02:13.000
I sympathize with him
and with many of his songs.

02:25.959 --> 02:28.519
<i> The fact that you could work</i>
<i>with such a famous artist</i>

02:28.600 --> 02:31.320
<i>on your first project like this</i>
<i>would be amazing, you know?</i>

02:32.239 --> 02:35.239
I think J. Balvin is
one of the best singers in the world.

02:35.799 --> 02:36.920
I love his music.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.799
I love his voice.

02:39.799 --> 02:43.000
He is a fighter. He is very sensitive.

02:43.640 --> 02:44.720
Very kind.

02:44.799 --> 02:46.799
Let me know when you have news.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.080
<i> I'll let you know if they confirm.</i>

02:49.160 --> 02:52.280
- Thank you very much. A kiss. Bye.
- <i> You too. Ciao.</i>

03:09.720 --> 03:13.160
These years in Turin have been… wonderful.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.600
We've been incredibly happy.

03:16.120 --> 03:19.920
My kids have grown up in the best way,
in contact with nature,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.080
and, well, I hope I don't leave
but if I do,

03:23.160 --> 03:25.600
this will be a city
that has taught me so much.

03:28.360 --> 03:32.480
I take with me great people,
and an unforgettable experience.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.679
In football, things change just like that.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.560
So you have to be prepared for everything,
for every challenge,

03:43.640 --> 03:45.560
and I've been ready since I was 18.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.040
So, let's wait and see.

03:49.239 --> 03:52.320
MADRID, SPAIN

04:01.880 --> 04:03.880
- Good morning.
- Hello.

04:03.959 --> 04:07.239
I've come to get some presents
because it's Júnior's birthday.

04:07.839 --> 04:08.880
Okay.

04:11.040 --> 04:14.920
I like to buy clothes for him
because it's what he uses the most.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.039
And I also like to act as his assistant,
as a personal shopper.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.000
I lend him my clothes too,

04:21.079 --> 04:25.720
since we have the same size of shoes
and pants, so, you know, we share them.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.960
- What's his usual size?
- He's 11 but he's an S.

04:31.039 --> 04:32.800
- This one.
- Super.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
- Uh, and a sweater too.
- Yes. This one's a little over-sized.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.360
Like, with mini prints.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.160
Okay, I don't like the one
with the palm trees.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.280
This one's cool too.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.560
I like that one more.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.320
Okay, and what do you have
in the women's section?

04:47.840 --> 04:49.599
Women? Look. It's like a fantasy.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.680
Hmm. I love it.

04:55.919 --> 04:57.320
I love this one.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.240
And this one.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.400
I'll take this white one too.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.880
Well, yeah, I like shopping.

05:03.960 --> 05:07.160
I like having nice things in my closet,
and I like looking good.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.840
Oh, this look's marvelous. Oh, I love it.

05:09.919 --> 05:12.160
- Pink looks great on you.
- Yeah, right.

05:12.240 --> 05:15.440
- Give me… I think I'm a 38, right?
- Yes.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.200
- 38 or 36?
- No, no, no. I can be misleading.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.640
Yes, this is it.

05:19.720 --> 05:23.760
I don't really like going shopping
because I don't like to try stuff on.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.560
But I do have the assistance
of the shops I usually go to,

05:26.640 --> 05:29.120
since they make it easy for me
to take them back.

05:29.880 --> 05:30.760
This is divine.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.840
- And this is also super nice.
- Yes.

05:35.880 --> 05:36.760
Or this one.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.160
Oh, please, this is so lovely.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.880
- I've got it all here, yes.
- Okay. Oh, the t-shirt?

05:49.960 --> 05:52.280
- You're taking it right?
- Yeah, but I'll take the jersey too,

05:52.359 --> 05:54.400
so I can have the full look
when I'm traveling.

05:54.479 --> 05:58.599
- Look, you have some jewels here too.
- Yes, but I like these plastic ones.

05:58.680 --> 05:59.640
So, how much are they?

06:00.240 --> 06:03.640
- Are they expensive?
- Well, it's between 50 and 60 euros.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.080
No, it's not expensive.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.720
I love this one. This one.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.280
And those over there. They're so special.

06:10.359 --> 06:13.520
I think I'll take the orange one
which doesn't stand out on me.

06:13.599 --> 06:14.440
Right.

06:14.520 --> 06:17.359
However long it'll last
with my daughters around.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.479
Every time I have jewelry,
they want to wear it.

06:19.560 --> 06:23.799
If it's plastic and not a diamond,
it's not as painful to let them have it.

06:27.640 --> 06:28.680
- Yes.
- Well…

06:28.760 --> 06:31.440
I can always put a little piece
of plastic here.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.280
Well… no.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.400
- No? No.
- No.

06:35.479 --> 06:36.680
I just don't have a size.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.880
No, I… think it's best
to find another one in your size.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.000
But it won't fit.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.960
- Okay, so I'll take these three.
- Okay.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.359
Okay.

06:50.240 --> 06:54.160
She came for a present
and leaves with half the store, my loves.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.000
I'll walk you out.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.120
Júnior's birthday is approaching.

07:08.200 --> 07:12.080
I'm really excited to prepare a surprise
for him with the babies,

07:12.160 --> 07:14.960
which is to make his birthday cake
all together.

07:15.479 --> 07:16.840
Here's the doorbell.

07:16.919 --> 07:19.799
- Who wants to… Press there.
- Me.

07:25.039 --> 07:27.400
- Hello.
- Hello.

07:27.479 --> 07:29.640
Hi, there. Welcome home.

07:29.719 --> 07:32.520
- Come in. How are you, Gio?
- Very well.

07:32.599 --> 07:35.799
- Welcome. So nice to see you.
- Looking forward to making cakes.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.719
I'm Andrea.
I'm Gio's pastry chef in Madrid.

07:40.799 --> 07:44.719
The first cake I made for Gio was
about four or five years ago,

07:44.799 --> 07:46.120
and it was for Cris Júnior.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.680
Eva and Mateo's birthday cakes
were made by Andrea.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.760
Mom's friend. She made them.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.520
There was one about <i>Frozen, </i>right?

07:56.200 --> 07:59.080
And there was a Spider-Man one.
Whose was it?

08:00.719 --> 08:02.000
- Mateo's.
- Oh, Mateo's.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.679
- It… It didn't have cocoa.
- No… No sugar.

08:04.760 --> 08:08.560
No, there was one with no sugar.
because you have to eat healthy too, huh?

08:09.880 --> 08:10.919
Isn't that right?

08:12.599 --> 08:15.320
I… I don't like the… the "health" cake.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.120
You don't like it? Health cake.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.840
Healthy. No, she doesn't.

08:20.599 --> 08:23.760
I try to make something special
out of everything for them.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.039
Afternoon snacks, candy, everything.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.120
Are you ready?

08:27.200 --> 08:28.039
Yes!

08:28.120 --> 08:31.359
- Okay, so what do we do first?
- Let's add flour and sugar. Let's go.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.159
Ah!

08:36.360 --> 08:37.919
Now, the eggs.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.280
- Very good.
- The eggs.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.199
One…

08:43.679 --> 08:44.520
The eggs!

08:44.600 --> 08:48.120
- Bravo! See, darling?
- I know.

08:48.199 --> 08:50.079
- Yes, you do, my love.
- Very good.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.560
- The oil. Here, I'll help you.
- The oil!

08:56.640 --> 08:58.160
Do we pour it?

08:58.240 --> 09:00.240
Yes, we have to pour all of it.
All the way.

09:00.320 --> 09:01.880
And finally, the milk.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.440
- The milk.
- Here. Mom will help.

09:04.520 --> 09:06.640
And it's going to be great.
You'll see.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.600
- Yes, you'll see.
- Mateo, I'll help you.

09:10.760 --> 09:11.760
Who's strong?

09:11.840 --> 09:12.800
Me!

09:13.560 --> 09:15.000
You're all strong.

09:15.079 --> 09:16.800
Now, ready with this one.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.800
- Like this. Very good.
- Look, kids.

09:18.880 --> 09:22.079
One, two… Look, in circles.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.800
- I did it.
- Take both of them.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.480
- Look how well Alana did with both hands.
- Like this.

09:27.240 --> 09:28.959
Do you like cake?

09:29.040 --> 09:31.480
I love it!
Isn't the cake delicious?

09:31.560 --> 09:33.560
Let's see. Very good, Eva.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.600
Oh, Mateo is finished. Great.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.360
- So, do you like making cakes?
- Yes.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.839
It's making me so hungry.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.160
Let's make the cake first.
Come on.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.320
One cake…

09:45.640 --> 09:47.079
And that's all, folks.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.600
We put it in the oven for 30 minutes,

09:49.680 --> 09:52.000
at 160 degrees…

09:52.720 --> 09:56.520
And the cake rises and we eat it.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.240
Well, we'll wait for 30 minutes,

09:59.320 --> 10:01.520
and meanwhile, we can start
with the cupcakes.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.440
Yummy!

10:02.520 --> 10:04.720
People congratulate me
on their education

10:04.800 --> 10:06.680
and on how stimulated they are.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.760
They are so intelligent.

10:08.839 --> 10:11.079
They've experienced a lot
since they were so little.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.320
We do circles, circles, circles…

10:28.120 --> 10:31.160
Perfect! I love it. Bravo!

10:31.240 --> 10:35.040
Congratulations, because you did
such a wonderful job, kids.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.240
MADRID THEME PARK

10:48.160 --> 10:51.920
Well, guys. We've come here
to celebrate Júnior's birthday.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.640
They've opened the theme park for us.

10:59.760 --> 11:03.320
So, yeah, let's have fun
and thank you so much for coming.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.280
We'll miss Dad,

11:05.360 --> 11:08.079
but we're all here to support
the biggest kid in the house.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.839
So, let's have fun.

11:11.400 --> 11:15.320
Celebrating his birthday in a theme park,
that opened just for us,

11:15.400 --> 11:16.839
is so surreal.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.600
That stuff only happens with her.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.480
MADRID THEME PARK

11:29.280 --> 11:31.959
It's awesome. Look!
Who's going to ride that one

11:32.040 --> 11:33.440
- Go, please.
- Me!

11:33.520 --> 11:35.640
Oh, my God! It's so tall!

11:35.719 --> 11:38.640
Spending Cris's birthday
in the theme park, you know,

11:38.719 --> 11:40.040
it was so much fun.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.760
It's like a dream, so what better way
than sharing it with him?

11:44.360 --> 11:46.160
We'll wait here and watch.

11:47.839 --> 11:48.839
Shit.

11:50.079 --> 11:53.240
- Yes, let's go, boys.
- Careful with your phone, Edu.

11:53.320 --> 11:56.000
Now it goes three, two, one
and drops.

11:56.079 --> 11:57.719
- Three, two, one…

12:01.880 --> 12:03.600
Oh my God!

12:03.680 --> 12:06.480
- Júnior, did you get scared?
- Júnior, say hi.

12:07.480 --> 12:08.400
Cristiano Júnior…

12:08.480 --> 12:11.000
His face, when he got on
that shuttle thing, it's like…

12:11.079 --> 12:14.079
"What are these bastards up to?"
"What did I get in to?"

12:14.160 --> 12:15.600
The kid's brave, you know?

12:16.160 --> 12:18.079
I think I was more afraid than he was.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.600
- Are you not up to it?
- But will I get sick?

12:20.680 --> 12:22.839
- I don't wanna get dizzy.
- If you don't want to, don't.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.240
- Uh, you're going to die.
- Wait until Gio gets in.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.560
- Gio, I'll hold your purse, okay?
- One minute.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.199
- See you.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.760
- Come on!
- Let's see.

12:32.199 --> 12:35.079
- Man… So, how does this work?
- Bring it down like this, hon.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.360
- And the belt?
- The guy will do it for us.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.360
Oh, so he fastens it?

12:39.440 --> 12:40.640
I was so scared.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.199
It's so scary!

12:42.280 --> 12:43.839
It's okay, it's okay. Don't worry.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.680
You crap your pants up there, huh?

12:47.199 --> 12:49.320
You drop, like, so fast…

12:49.400 --> 12:51.400
Oh my God, it's so scary!

12:51.480 --> 12:52.719
Good luck.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.240
When I saw Georgina getting on that thing
all the way up,

12:56.320 --> 12:59.199
I thought, "She has no idea
how high it really goes."

12:59.280 --> 13:01.520
I mean, she hasn't.
I mean, she has no idea.

13:01.599 --> 13:02.599
No!

13:03.240 --> 13:06.520
- Shit no! You bastard!

13:14.680 --> 13:15.839
It was so scary!

13:19.240 --> 13:21.160
What kind of joke is this?

13:23.599 --> 13:25.120
How terrifying!

13:25.199 --> 13:27.440
- Well, let's buy a…

13:27.520 --> 13:29.280
I'm terrified of rides.

13:29.839 --> 13:31.480
My friends tricked me.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.400
Jeez, what was I thinking?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.800
I thought I'd die in mid-air.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.680
- I can definitely ride that one.
- I can't ride that one.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.440
Or you'll have to take me to the ER.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.560
- Let's do this.
- Just them.

13:55.079 --> 13:56.160
Don't make this too fast.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.240
- That scares me.
- Of course, of course.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.560
- I'm so scared, Cris!
- Tell them that.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.520
- I'm so nervous. Don't talk to me!
- He is so scared.

14:03.599 --> 14:05.120
If I shit my pants…

14:05.199 --> 14:07.880
Slowly, please! Slowly! Slowly!

14:10.360 --> 14:12.199
Slowly, okay?

14:15.599 --> 14:16.719
I can't.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.920
- I can't.

14:24.240 --> 14:27.000
- No way I'm doing that! I can't!
- I'd die!

14:29.240 --> 14:33.079
- Oh, please, stop. Stop it! Stop!

14:33.160 --> 14:34.640
- Stop, stop.
- I'm dying.

14:34.719 --> 14:36.680
I'm not doing this, not again.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.599
I pass already. Do you want popcorn?

14:40.560 --> 14:42.680
Hi, we're… Are you here yet?

14:42.760 --> 14:45.040
It felt like falling off a cliff.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.439
Right, okay, I'll tell them
to open the doors.

14:47.959 --> 14:49.719
Okay, see you in a bit.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.079
- Vero is coming with the girls.
- Do you want water?

14:52.160 --> 14:55.360
In 2015, I worked as an au pair
in Bristol,

14:55.439 --> 14:59.479
so I took care of two twin girls
and we stay in touch to this day.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.800
I've always invited them
to my childrens' birthdays.

15:02.880 --> 15:06.079
We've kept in touch since I left
and, to me, they're my girls.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.319
See?

15:08.839 --> 15:11.000
Mom took care of them
when they were your age.

15:11.079 --> 15:12.760
They were little girls just like you.

15:13.959 --> 15:14.920
Huh?

15:21.719 --> 15:22.880
Yes.

15:26.319 --> 15:27.839
Look, they have earrings.

15:28.439 --> 15:29.400
They're nice.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.280
Right?

15:35.760 --> 15:38.400
- Check Alana's hair.
- Hi, how are you.

15:40.079 --> 15:42.079
- Oh, so cute.

15:44.280 --> 15:45.439
Is Mary your friend?

15:45.959 --> 15:47.880
- Yes, they're friends.
- Take her hand.

15:47.959 --> 15:48.839
Like this.

15:49.439 --> 15:50.680
Wow!

15:51.360 --> 15:52.479
It's great.

15:54.680 --> 15:56.719
How long were you together in Bristol?

15:57.359 --> 15:58.400
Two months, right?

15:59.359 --> 16:02.040
- Three months. That's so cool.
- September, October, November.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.439
They were their age.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.199
Three, about to turn four.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.719
- Do you remember when I taught you ballet?
- Yes.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.599
Mom told me you were great dancers.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.359
They dance with Mom?

16:12.439 --> 16:13.920
- Like this.
- Like this?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.680
- Do you still dance?
- Very good.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.120
What else? Gymnastics? That's nice.

16:18.839 --> 16:19.760
Yes, Gio.

16:19.839 --> 16:23.359
I'm so fond of them.
I walked them, showered them,

16:23.439 --> 16:25.160
took them to school, fed them.

16:25.240 --> 16:28.000
I learned so much. I learned to be a mom

16:28.079 --> 16:31.560
because that's where I really learned
how to take care of babies.

16:31.640 --> 16:32.599
In Bristol.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.000
- …bumped into me.
- They have a connection with them.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.000
- Yes.
- Yes.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.599
- More than with other kids.
- Yeah.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.800
But it's because I talk a lot about them.

16:41.680 --> 16:45.319
- This way, girls. This way.
- Very good, sharing is very important.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.040
- Well, in the green one.
- Come on.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.280
Let's go! Come on.

16:51.359 --> 16:53.280
- Which one do we get in to?
- Who's coming with us?

16:53.359 --> 16:54.199
- Okay.
- Let's go!

16:54.280 --> 16:56.040
Okay, let's close this.

16:56.959 --> 16:58.079
Belt…

16:59.240 --> 17:00.479
Goodbye, goodbye!

17:05.000 --> 17:06.399
We're flying! We're flying!

17:10.399 --> 17:11.520
Hold on. Bye-bye.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.839
As a mother, Gio is super loving.

17:14.359 --> 17:17.880
She's always giving them little surprises,
games…

17:17.960 --> 17:20.280
She's full of youth and energy,

17:20.359 --> 17:24.200
so it's so much fun
because she's playing all day long.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.599
- Girls!
- It's over.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.440
- Bravo, my loves.

17:30.960 --> 17:31.880
You saw that…

17:32.720 --> 17:36.760
We had so much fun at Júnior's birthday,
and I made him so happy.

17:53.919 --> 17:56.040
Oh my God,
what a beautiful cake!

17:56.880 --> 17:58.560
A wish! Make a wish, Cris!

18:00.120 --> 18:01.320
Bravo!

18:01.919 --> 18:04.960
Well, it was made by Alana, Mateo and Eva.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.399
- They made the cake for you.
- Wow, the brother.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.560
Kiss your brother.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.640
- I helped them.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.200
- My love.
- Oh, so lovely.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.280
For a mother, the fact that
Júnior liked the surprise so much is…

18:19.840 --> 18:21.919
It's the most beautiful thing
that can happen

18:22.000 --> 18:24.120
after so much dedication and time

18:24.640 --> 18:28.840
because, you know, a birthday party
definitely takes time, right?

18:29.880 --> 18:31.520
- Look! A t-shirt.
- So nice.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.159
- It's lovely.
- Thank you. It's really nice.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.600
- Super.
- Mauro, come.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.960
This is the nice one
I told you about, right?

18:38.040 --> 18:39.480
- Carlos… For you.
- Thanks!

18:40.280 --> 18:42.240
- Here, open this one.
- Thank you.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.320
- Aw.
- Thanks!

18:44.399 --> 18:48.320
Gio as a mother… She's perfect.
I mean, she's up to date about everything.

18:48.399 --> 18:50.640
She's on top of everything 24/7,

18:50.720 --> 18:55.159
and she's completely involved at all times
in their education and development.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.159
You'll like this one a lot. Come, Carlos.

19:01.919 --> 19:04.880
Whoa! Thank you all for this.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.480
- Enjoy, enjoy.
- Thank you.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.760
Thank you, thank you.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.440
Gio's not just an excellent mother.
She's more than that.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.280
Gio has other qualities
that people don't know about.

19:18.360 --> 19:21.120
Gio helps me a lot in many, many aspects.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.280
Insparya is a hair health clinic.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.200
It's Cristiano's
and I am the administrator.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.520
And the business
is going very well for us.

19:34.600 --> 19:38.679
We're making a lot of people happy,
and well, I hope everything continues

19:38.760 --> 19:40.080
as well as it has so far.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.560
She's very hardworking, with her own ideas

19:44.640 --> 19:45.919
about my businesses,

19:46.000 --> 19:50.399
about my hotels,
about Insparya, for instance too.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.840
She's given her opinion.

19:51.919 --> 19:55.679
She has that sensibility
for business, to help me,

19:55.760 --> 19:57.320
to give me her opinion,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.280
and I take that a lot
into consideration too.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.360
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.600
Good morning.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.560
Well, we'll explain the procedure
and so on.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.960
The treatment involves the collection
of a small blood sample.

20:12.679 --> 20:15.840
You know that the main goal of PRP
is to regenerate the follicular unit.

20:18.280 --> 20:22.600
So that will mean a much healthier,
thicker, brighter hair,

20:22.679 --> 20:24.800
so that we can get the hair we like.

20:24.880 --> 20:28.320
So let's start with the blood collection,
and then we'll proceed with

20:28.399 --> 20:30.520
applying the treatment
all over your scalp.

20:31.280 --> 20:32.240
Okay. Perfect.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.320
Okay? But it'll do you wonders
for sure.

20:34.399 --> 20:37.080
I don't have great hair.
I have hair.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.720
- Film it if you can.
- Yes. Fine.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.840
- This one is, like, very fast.
- Okay.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.560
- Ah, stretch your arm a bit.
- Should I clench my fist?

20:46.640 --> 20:49.320
Yes, clench you fist.
I'll prick now, okay?

20:49.840 --> 20:51.919
Hmm. The prick didn't hurt at all.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.159
She's good at it.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.280
I'm taking it
to the centrifuge, okay?

21:02.960 --> 21:05.720
All right, so let's begin
to apply the treatment.

21:05.800 --> 21:06.919
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

21:07.919 --> 21:09.040
Let's start.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.960
We'll draw five imaginary lines.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.880
I'm applying the first line now.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.200
It doesn't hurt.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.280
Okay, second administration.

21:29.919 --> 21:33.760
They have a technique with vibrations here
and you don't even notice it.

21:33.840 --> 21:36.040
It works really well actually.
I really liked it.

21:37.040 --> 21:40.280
- Done. Perfect.
- Okay. Great then.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.040
- It's so easy.
- Yes.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.679
You're great with the needle.

21:47.760 --> 21:50.439
- It didn't hurt at all and I didn't bleed.

21:50.520 --> 21:52.679
- You did a perfect job.
- Okay, take care.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.120
- You too.
- Bye.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.960
I love to look after myself,
and I need it.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.320
It's something that is part of my routine

21:59.399 --> 22:01.679
to feel good
both physically and emotionally.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.919
MARBELLA, SPAIN

22:20.520 --> 22:22.320
- Oh my God!
- Whoa!

22:22.399 --> 22:24.919
- Hello.
- That looks delicious.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.960
What kind of dream rice is this?

22:28.040 --> 22:29.800
God, it looks amazing!

22:29.880 --> 22:32.360
- I hope you enjoy it.
- Thank you.

22:32.439 --> 22:34.520
Thank you.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.280
This is so good, huh?

22:44.560 --> 22:48.040
When the Darlings get together,
it's mostly for the laughs,

22:48.120 --> 22:50.480
to have fun, and to unwind.

22:50.560 --> 22:53.120
We love to eat, so we enjoy eating.

22:53.679 --> 22:54.720
We have a blast.

22:54.800 --> 22:58.679
A toast to Iván's birthday.
He's reached his thirties wonderfully,

22:58.760 --> 23:00.560
and here's to a 100 more.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.399
And another toast…

23:02.480 --> 23:05.760
because tonight I'm getting an award
and I'm so happy about it.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.360
I'm a bit nervous

23:07.439 --> 23:10.439
because I have to be on stage
and I don't know what to say.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.360
So there, let's toast, and…

23:13.439 --> 23:15.919
- Let's toast for the great award.
- For all of you.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.880
- Congratulations!
- For all of you.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.480
Congratulations, Iván.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.520
I'll be given an award today
for my good deeds.

23:23.560 --> 23:27.280
It never occurred to me
that someday I'd get this kind of award,

23:27.960 --> 23:29.360
and for this reason.

23:30.080 --> 23:33.040
So I'm extremely grateful
and really happy.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.480
Hey, darling, so
what are you gonna wear tonight?

23:36.000 --> 23:39.080
Ali K's green dress,
the one I couldn't wear in Cannes.

23:39.159 --> 23:41.399
So, as always, fate lays out our lives,

23:41.480 --> 23:43.640
because I didn't know
I was going to get this award.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.520
And it was ready for you, right?

23:46.280 --> 23:48.480
I had a dress ready for a great occasion.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.919
I'll finally wear Ali K's dress
at Starlite.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.840
So, since this is my first red carpet
since Cannes,

23:56.919 --> 23:59.679
and I wanted to wear it so, so, so much…

23:59.760 --> 24:03.960
Well, now that I have the opportunity,
I'll definitely wear Ali K's dress.

24:04.679 --> 24:05.640
Hello!

24:05.720 --> 24:06.800
Hi!

24:06.880 --> 24:09.240
I… I'm going to eat candy.

24:10.720 --> 24:11.880
Bravo!

24:12.600 --> 24:14.000
What about fish?

24:14.760 --> 24:17.280
Who… who wants fish with candy?

24:17.360 --> 24:19.520
Ugh!

24:38.240 --> 24:39.520
Open it soon.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.840
Clap, clap. Great.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.040
Aw, thank you, thank you.

24:55.919 --> 24:57.280
I just get emotional.

24:57.960 --> 24:58.960
I get emotional.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.360
- A wonderful La Zagaleta polo.

25:01.439 --> 25:03.360
Put it on. Put it on!

25:03.439 --> 25:04.560
No!

25:05.080 --> 25:08.120
- No way I'm changing! No way I'm changing.
- He's wearing his Gucci.

25:08.199 --> 25:11.159
I mean, come on, not many people
can afford going to La Zagaleta

25:11.240 --> 25:12.399
and buying this polo.

25:12.919 --> 25:16.000
I have an option B
because your reaction made me sad.

25:16.640 --> 25:20.040
This is the first time
you don't try on a present. You're cheeky.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.120
You can pretend now
but we know you, darling.

25:23.199 --> 25:24.399
I mean…

25:24.480 --> 25:27.439
- I'm actually really nervous, you know?
- It's for Christmas. Exactly.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.840
- Or for the car.
- We're the same.

25:29.919 --> 25:32.560
- Oh my God.
- This "diamy." God, God, God.

25:32.640 --> 25:36.640
- There's… there's a diamond.
- But carefully, or it may break.

25:38.600 --> 25:42.640
I mean, I… I mean, I'm shaking.
Excuse me? I mean, I can't believe it.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.360
Well, you'll have to
go get measured.

25:45.439 --> 25:47.439
"I'll have to go
and get it changed."

25:47.960 --> 25:49.159
- I mean…

25:49.240 --> 25:50.960
This is like the shoe
in Cinderella.

25:51.040 --> 25:52.520
If it doesn't fit, you return it.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.040
I mean, a full diamond ring.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.439
Girl, I mean, are you crazy?

25:56.520 --> 25:58.199
- You're welcome, Iván.
- Shit.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.120
- It was so expensive.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.960
In the end, Darlings,
and Georgina as a matriarch,

26:04.040 --> 26:06.240
is a bit like the family we've chosen.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.480
STARLITE - CATALANA OCCIDENTE

26:32.800 --> 26:34.800
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

26:35.320 --> 26:36.919
This way.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.080
This way, please.

26:38.159 --> 26:41.679
Getting an award and going on stage
to talk in front of so many people,

26:41.760 --> 26:45.040
I'm a little bit nervous,
and happy at the same time.

26:54.399 --> 26:56.399
- Hello, how are you?
- You look gorgeous.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.439
- Nice to meet you.
- I think we've met before.

26:58.520 --> 26:59.399
- Have we?
- Yes.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.480
- I don't know.
- So have you all come?

27:01.560 --> 27:03.280
- The kids? Your husband too?
- Yeah, the kids.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.960
- No, he's playing today. In Barcelona.
- Oh, really?

27:06.040 --> 27:09.000
- You make one hell of a couple. Yeah!
- Really? Thank you.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.560
- You really do.
- He's great, Cristiano.

27:12.480 --> 27:15.320
Look at that dress!
Look at her. It's amazing!

27:15.399 --> 27:16.880
You can borrow it any time.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.880
I love it. Where do I stand?

27:18.960 --> 27:21.600
- You two have met before, right?
- Yes, we've met in Madrid.

27:21.679 --> 27:24.360
But I lost track of her
because she went to Turin.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.960
Hello. I don't even know how to greet you.

27:28.560 --> 27:31.520
- Kiss me, air kisses.
- Air kisses.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.320
- I've greeted you before so…
- Right.

27:33.399 --> 27:36.399
- Okay, well… Hey, I don't know…
- Yeah, me too.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.399
Okay, I'm coming, Antonio.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.320
- I know you're in here…
- You come in here.

27:40.399 --> 27:42.919
People who are taller than me
shouldn't be in the shot.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.760
- Okay, I'll allow you.
- Right, right.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.800
- I'll introduce you to her.
- Hi.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.720
- How are you?
- Great. Nice to meet you.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.120
Likewise.

28:01.199 --> 28:03.520
You know, every time my friends
go to the supermarket,

28:03.600 --> 28:06.439
they always buy me your breadsticks
to go with the Iberian ham.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.399
- No way, really?
- We pig out with your breadsticks.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.600
- They're the best, don't deny.
- Yes, they are.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.480
Great.

28:22.560 --> 28:25.199
- This way, please.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.280
Whoo!

28:38.360 --> 28:39.520
This way, right?

28:40.080 --> 28:41.360
Finally!

28:42.159 --> 28:44.080
I hope my voice doesn't tremble.

28:44.159 --> 28:45.720
- Hi! Hello there.
- How are you?

28:46.240 --> 28:49.040
I'm rehearsing what I'll say.
My thank-yous.

28:49.120 --> 28:49.959
Really?

28:50.040 --> 28:52.080
Yeah, but my voice
is already like maracas.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.560
Actually, my voice isn't enough
in this part.

28:55.639 --> 28:56.800
It's just very long, yeah.

28:56.879 --> 28:59.040
<i>It's just a game for you and nothing more</i>

28:59.120 --> 29:00.000
<i>And I don't know</i>

29:00.080 --> 29:02.679
<i>You were always the gun</i>
<i>And I was the bullet</i>

29:02.760 --> 29:05.240
If I keep my voice down,
I think I can do it.

29:05.320 --> 29:08.919
I have to sing all of it so it's fine.
You can jump in whenever you like to.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.760
- Guys, it's time..
- How do you feel? Confident?

29:11.840 --> 29:16.000
We believe we can't pass up
the opportunity to award Georgina.

29:16.080 --> 29:20.320
Her humble background
is the key to her vocation and empathy.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.760
Among the charitable causes she supports,

29:23.840 --> 29:27.159
her collaboration
with Nuevo Futuro stands out,

29:27.240 --> 29:29.639
visiting and financially helping children

29:29.720 --> 29:32.080
with family problems
in these foster homes.

29:33.280 --> 29:36.800
Also, her close relationship
with the Esfera Foundation

29:36.879 --> 29:38.679
dedicating her time to disabled people.

29:38.760 --> 29:41.320
- Dear, I get weak in the knees.
- You'll get to the award.

29:42.439 --> 29:44.360
- I need to take her.
- Okay.

29:46.639 --> 29:48.080
For all those reasons,

29:48.159 --> 29:52.919
the 2021 Starlite Award
goes to Georgina Rodríguez.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.040
- Welcome, Georgina.

29:55.120 --> 29:57.240
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.120
Thank you.

29:59.199 --> 30:00.600
Congratulations. Thank you so much.

30:00.679 --> 30:01.919
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.760
- It's so beautiful.
- It's all yours.

30:07.360 --> 30:10.320
I feel the need to help people. I need it.

30:10.919 --> 30:13.439
And helping others makes me really happy.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.840
Whether it's with money,
or presence or visibility.

30:17.439 --> 30:21.399
Giving them some of my visibility,
so that they can also be seen and heard.

30:21.480 --> 30:22.959
Well, why not?

30:23.040 --> 30:24.760
If I can help them out.

30:25.280 --> 30:27.000
Thank you very much.

30:27.080 --> 30:31.199
It is an honor to be here
and especially to receive a charity award.

30:31.280 --> 30:35.760
I ask life for health
for myself and especially for everyone.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.199
<i> Charitable acts are born</i>
<i>from the heart</i>

30:40.280 --> 30:42.199
<i>and you don't care about when.</i>

30:43.280 --> 30:47.199
<i>What matters is to get it done quickly.</i>
<i>When they need it.</i>

30:48.040 --> 30:49.480
Hello!

30:51.040 --> 30:53.639
You're looking great!
All of you, right?

30:53.720 --> 30:54.679
How are you?

30:54.760 --> 30:55.879
Hello!

30:55.959 --> 30:59.360
<i> And giving a voice</i>
<i>to those unknown associations.</i>

31:00.360 --> 31:02.240
Gio wants to treat us to eat here.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.879
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

31:06.840 --> 31:08.840
- So, are you hungry?

31:08.919 --> 31:09.879
Let's go then.

31:12.679 --> 31:14.560
<i>I'm very supportive.</i>

31:14.639 --> 31:18.360
<i>I'm very supportive of people</i>
<i>and especially of those who need it.</i>

31:27.840 --> 31:30.240
- Well, we have a little something for you.
- Really?

31:30.320 --> 31:31.480
From the foundation.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.399
- Thank you so much.
- Okay, look.

31:35.199 --> 31:37.240
Well, I also made a letter
and a drawing for you.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.760
"My friend, Georgina,
we know you like children."

31:40.840 --> 31:42.919
"That is why you have started
a nice family,

31:43.000 --> 31:44.560
and have become a wonderful mother."

31:45.199 --> 31:46.720
"You give so much love."

31:46.800 --> 31:49.840
"That shows what a great human being
you are and how much

31:49.919 --> 31:51.240
you care about people."

31:51.879 --> 31:54.080
"You are supportive of people
who lack love

31:54.159 --> 31:56.320
or who are more special, like us."

31:56.879 --> 32:00.040
"You are always willing to add your grain
of hope wherever it is needed."

32:00.120 --> 32:02.280
"Thank you for collaborating with us."

32:02.360 --> 32:06.360
- Oh, thank you, Marisa.

32:06.919 --> 32:09.879
Together we can make a better world.

32:09.959 --> 32:11.879
May we be supportive.

32:11.959 --> 32:13.679
Thank you.

32:13.760 --> 32:15.040
Thank you, Georgina.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.560
When I received the award,
I thought about my mother,

32:17.639 --> 32:21.439
for the values she instilled in me,
and my father, of course.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.560
About my sister, Cristiano,
my family, my children.

32:26.159 --> 32:29.120
And I dedicated it
to all the people who love me too.

32:29.199 --> 32:32.040
Georgina, please,
I'm going to ask you to stay.

32:32.120 --> 32:33.360
- Okay.
- Okay?

32:33.439 --> 32:35.760
Because a very special moment
is coming up.

32:35.840 --> 32:38.520
So join us here on stage to welcome Beret.

32:48.480 --> 32:49.399
Let's go!

33:42.679 --> 33:43.800
Whoo!

33:45.840 --> 33:49.360
This is the beginning.
I'll keep helping as much as I can.

33:49.439 --> 33:52.919
And… And I encourage people to help.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.919
Cast your bread upon the waters.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.639
Thank you so much. Really.

33:56.719 --> 33:59.280
For choosing my song,
for singing it with me.

33:59.360 --> 34:03.159
You know, it's my pleasure to do this
with such a wonderful purpose, right?

34:03.240 --> 34:05.199
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much, Beret.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.319
A round of applause, please.
Thank you, Georgina.

34:21.480 --> 34:24.880
It's so important for me
to remember where I come from.

34:24.960 --> 34:25.799
Who I am.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.000
And well,

34:27.080 --> 34:31.839
in the end, your life, your experiences
make you become who you really are.

34:31.920 --> 34:35.080
So I'm super happy to have become
the woman I am today.

34:38.080 --> 34:42.839
The world can see who is the Georgina
behind the social media, and…

34:43.679 --> 34:46.480
behind the news
that the press publishes about me.

34:50.400 --> 34:54.600
Many people used to know me
for being Cristiano Ronaldo's girlfriend,

34:54.679 --> 34:57.319
and today, they know me for who I am.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.839
I am Georgina.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.799
I've been able to return
to my roots.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.480
To laugh out loud.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.640
To get emotional.

35:18.400 --> 35:21.799
To celebrate life every minute, every day…

35:23.440 --> 35:25.680
and to share happiness with my family.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.680
MANCHESTER, ENGLAND

35:37.200 --> 35:39.760
MANCHESTER UNITED SIGNS CRISTIANO RONALDO

35:41.960 --> 35:44.400
RONALDO BACK AT UNITED
CITY PULLS OUT

35:44.480 --> 35:46.960
MAN OF THE MOMENT!

35:47.040 --> 35:49.280
BACK TO MANCHESTER AFTER 12 YEARS

35:51.520 --> 35:53.720
We finally had to leave.

35:53.799 --> 35:55.000
I'm so excited.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.920
I know things will work out great.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.920
At the end of the day, my place is
where my partner is happy, of course,

36:01.000 --> 36:02.720
so we're moving there
with great excitement.

36:03.319 --> 36:04.480
This is just another stage

36:04.560 --> 36:06.839
where people are going to enjoy
my football, my goals.

36:06.920 --> 36:11.280
This doesn't end here.
It's not the end, it's the beginning.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.680
- <i> How are you?</i>
- Very good.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.600
Uh, recording non-stop.

36:21.200 --> 36:22.680
I heard your music in June,

36:22.760 --> 36:25.640
and I wanted to visualize
the reality show with…

36:27.920 --> 36:29.160
your super song.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.400
I sympathize very much
with many of your songs.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.799
I used to work at Gucci and sometimes

36:35.880 --> 36:37.839
Cristiano would drop me off
with the Bugatti.

36:37.920 --> 36:40.200
- Or another one of his cars…

36:40.280 --> 36:42.160
…and people would look at me and say,

36:42.240 --> 36:45.880
"You arrive in a bus or train,
yet you leave in a big car, right?"

36:45.960 --> 36:49.960
And I played your song and I said,
"I can't believe it."

36:52.160 --> 36:54.880
<i>Yes, it's a process</i>
<i>that we need to go through, right?</i>

36:54.960 --> 36:56.480
<i>I think that song is very…</i>

36:57.120 --> 36:58.480
<i>- Very realistic.</i>
- Yes.

36:58.560 --> 37:02.000
<i>To be grateful of the people</i>
<i>who are by your side from the beginning.</i>

37:02.560 --> 37:03.960
Of the friends,

37:04.040 --> 37:06.160
which is also difficult,
because people think…

37:06.240 --> 37:08.440
<i>Our friends are the family</i>
<i>we chose, right?</i>

37:08.520 --> 37:11.839
<i>The family we chose</i>
<i>because the other one we're stuck with.</i>

37:13.000 --> 37:15.400
- Congratulations for your baby!
- <i>Thanks!</i>

37:15.480 --> 37:17.400
He's a joy and a motivation.

37:18.319 --> 37:21.280
The truth is that our babies
are the best part of our lives.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.680
They give us the strength we need
and the joy we need to live.

37:26.440 --> 37:29.520
Well, I hope we see each other soon…

37:31.440 --> 37:33.080
and work together too.

37:35.200 --> 37:38.280
<i>Of course, my dear. Nice talking to you</i>
<i>and see you soon.</i>

37:38.839 --> 37:40.960
- <i>"I am Georgina."</i>
- Film!

37:41.040 --> 37:45.040
"0617002, take one."

37:45.600 --> 37:47.120
Okay, let's go. Hit me.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.760
Georgina. And, action.

37:49.839 --> 37:52.000
I was a waitress, I was a cleaner…

37:52.080 --> 37:54.000
- …I was a store clerk.

37:54.080 --> 37:56.600
- But now…
- And now I fucking rule.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.240
Yeah!

38:01.760 --> 38:05.080
- "So, Georgina, what's your experience?"

38:05.160 --> 38:08.480
So, I didn't know
if I should have made a reverence.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.319
Reference.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.960
- What did I say?
- "Reverence."

38:16.839 --> 38:17.960
Here… Here we go.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.560
Is it okay like this or what?

38:20.799 --> 38:23.319
- Did you get this body on camera or not?
- Her.

38:25.400 --> 38:29.240
I didn't know I was among
so much royalty and bureaucracy.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.640
So, what should I say?

38:38.520 --> 38:42.680
- "Aristocracy."
- I just keep saying "Aristocrazy."

38:43.880 --> 38:45.920
- My dog can't be trusted.
- Of course she can.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.920
She's too bitchy. I don't think it's right
when I look at her in the eyes…

38:49.000 --> 38:50.880
- She goes…

38:51.560 --> 38:53.520
Turn! Nice, nice.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.160
Good, good, good, good.

38:55.240 --> 38:57.080
So, how about that, huh?

39:00.240 --> 39:02.480
People will see every pore I have.
Back off.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.120
My blood was boiling…

39:05.200 --> 39:08.120
You'll capture all my imperfections,
come on.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.760
Is it a bug that wants to walk on my coat?

39:12.200 --> 39:14.520
- It's just a piece of shit.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.120
It's wet, huh?

39:20.200 --> 39:21.319
Another one?

39:22.040 --> 39:23.560
- Good?

39:24.799 --> 39:27.760
- Don't start cutting or I'll get mad.

39:27.839 --> 39:29.120
Are we done soon?

39:29.720 --> 39:32.760
Okay, let's… Let's pick up
from a bit earlier.

39:33.319 --> 39:36.359
Creating an email account
is taking me forever.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.160
My brain's run out of juice.

39:38.240 --> 39:41.400
Technology can never be beaten
by a pen and paper.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.760
I go full on blond
and it just won't stick.

39:45.280 --> 39:48.280
This is concrete right here.
and nothing sticks in here.

39:48.359 --> 39:50.920
Don't film this.
I have something between my teeth.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.040
There's something here.
Don't film! I have a bit of lamb.

39:54.120 --> 39:57.960
Because obviously,
I'll show you what I do best.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.560
Antonio farts a lot.

40:03.640 --> 40:06.880
- Yeah.
- Know who farts more? Pepe.

40:06.960 --> 40:10.720
Pepe is fat because he ate a lot.

40:11.720 --> 40:14.400
- I was like this and my eye…

40:14.480 --> 40:15.359
And my sister…

40:17.560 --> 40:20.160
- So now leave me alone now, will you?

40:20.240 --> 40:21.280
You can stop.

40:22.319 --> 40:26.240
This documentary is not about me, okay?
Mine's next.

40:26.920 --> 40:30.359
See you soon.
