WEBVTT

08:15.886 --> 08:16.954
We good.

08:16.987 --> 08:18.155
Hold up.

08:18.187 --> 08:20.190
Well take your sweet
fucking time, honey.

08:21.391 --> 08:22.426
Today!

08:22.459 --> 08:23.326
Almost.

08:25.327 --> 08:26.697
How do my teeth look?

08:26.730 --> 08:28.331
You look good.

08:28.365 --> 08:29.432
Good?

08:29.466 --> 08:30.834
They're perfect.

08:30.867 --> 08:33.037
Well that's what
I want to hear.

08:33.070 --> 08:35.304
If you take one
more damn minute!

08:35.337 --> 08:36.938
Ready.

08:36.972 --> 08:38.307
Good.

08:40.076 --> 08:41.845
I'm Max Hart,

08:41.878 --> 08:44.114
here live to give
you a first look

08:44.147 --> 08:47.318
at the building where
everything took place.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.222
For years, this
city has been trying

08:53.255 --> 08:55.225
to tear down this building.

08:55.258 --> 09:00.264
And now, finally, right
before Christmas, folks,

09:01.398 --> 09:03.000
we're getting a little
present early this year.

09:07.104 --> 09:09.940
With news that was
just released today,

09:09.972 --> 09:12.075
the tear down to this
building will begin

09:12.109 --> 09:13.844
the day after Christmas,

09:14.945 --> 09:17.815
finally, putting to
rest the horrible past.

09:25.121 --> 09:28.725
But what really happened here?

09:30.126 --> 09:34.897
Is the legend true
about this Ed Crow?

09:34.931 --> 09:39.937
The man who killed over 300
people in this building.

09:41.904 --> 09:46.910
Men, women, children,

09:48.378 --> 09:50.413
all killed by his hacksaw.

09:52.249 --> 09:53.317
Or was it all made up?

09:54.884 --> 09:58.121
This once former hospital
has still yet to release

09:58.154 --> 10:01.324
any documents confirming whether
or not this man, Ed Crow,

10:01.357 --> 10:02.759
in fact worked here.

10:06.462 --> 10:07.997
Or was it a game of copycat?

10:10.066 --> 10:13.870
Said people taking this
thing a little too far,

10:15.238 --> 10:19.910
wackos who call themselves
the followers of Ed Crow?

10:21.977 --> 10:24.413
When we come back, I'll be live

10:24.447 --> 10:26.783
with a man who believes
the legend is true.

10:26.817 --> 10:29.286
A brother to one of the victims

10:29.318 --> 10:32.188
who was last seen near this
building just last October.

10:33.190 --> 10:34.525
When we come back,

10:34.557 --> 10:36.927
I'll be live with Richard
Hill on The Hart Show.

10:41.197 --> 10:42.198
Good.

10:42.231 --> 10:43.533
That look good?

10:43.567 --> 10:46.003
It was great.

10:46.035 --> 10:48.104
My teeth, they look good?

10:48.138 --> 10:49.807
Yeah, they're good.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.810
That's not what I
want to hear, dick.

10:52.842 --> 10:53.476
They're perfect.

10:53.509 --> 10:54.345
My man.

11:44.094 --> 11:45.996
Are you recording?

11:46.028 --> 11:47.230
No,
I'm not recording.

11:47.264 --> 11:48.599
Asshole!

11:48.631 --> 11:51.934
Ow, are you
gonna help me pack or what?

11:51.967 --> 11:53.402
No, I'm
taking a shower.

11:53.436 --> 11:55.906
Get over here,
come and help me pack.

11:55.938 --> 11:57.940
Come on.

11:57.974 --> 12:00.878
This is how I need
a shower to get on the road.

12:02.278 --> 12:03.147
Thank you.

12:04.280 --> 12:09.285
Hey babe, if you watch
this or when you watch this,

12:10.986 --> 12:13.389
I just wanted to say thank you.

12:13.423 --> 12:16.960
What could've been an
easy plane ride back home

12:16.993 --> 12:20.264
has turned into a
two day road trip

12:20.297 --> 12:23.432
because someone thought
it would be a good idea.

12:23.466 --> 12:24.435
So thank you.

12:25.434 --> 12:27.403
I love you.

12:27.437 --> 12:30.507
And thanks for helping me pack.

12:34.610 --> 12:37.014
Oh, one other thing
I want to add,

12:37.047 --> 12:39.082
when we get married
and have kids,

12:40.616 --> 12:43.152
you're helping out, okay?

12:43.186 --> 12:45.022
I'm not gonna be
your fucking slave.

12:46.589 --> 12:47.991
Just wanted you to know that.

12:48.024 --> 12:50.326
Oh, and I get dibs on
naming the first kid.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.695
Knowing you you're going
to want to call him

12:51.727 --> 12:53.296
Sky or Friday or Apple

12:53.330 --> 12:57.167
or some stupid fucking
celebrity kid name.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.603
So, uh-uh, first dibs

12:59.635 --> 13:03.606
and you're not smoking
anymore, I've decided.

13:08.378 --> 13:09.947
What up, bee-otch?

13:13.115 --> 13:15.985
- What's wrong?
- I'm engaged.

13:16.019 --> 13:18.120
Oh my god!

13:18.153 --> 13:19.689
Oh, I'm gonna get Mom.

13:19.722 --> 13:21.223
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

13:21.256 --> 13:24.160
- Please don't get Mom.
- Okay, why?

13:24.193 --> 13:25.394
Because we're headed there.

13:25.427 --> 13:26.529
It's a surprise.

13:26.562 --> 13:28.331
- Oh really?
- Yes.

13:28.365 --> 13:29.966
What time are you
guys flying out?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.268
Well, we're driving.

13:32.601 --> 13:36.406
- Who's stupid idea was that?
- Mine.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.077
Please promise?

13:41.110 --> 13:43.746
Whatever, just don't take
forever to get here, okay?

13:43.779 --> 13:47.451
Teryn, promise me
you're not gonna tell Mom.

13:48.551 --> 13:49.420
Teryn?

13:50.787 --> 13:53.657
I promise, I promise,
I won't say anything.

13:53.690 --> 13:55.625
Okay, well, we got
to get on the road

13:55.658 --> 13:57.226
to head your way, okay?

13:57.259 --> 13:58.227
I'll see you soon.

13:58.260 --> 14:00.062
- Bye, bitch.
- Love you.

14:01.398 --> 14:02.231
I'm driving.

14:02.264 --> 14:03.500
I'm driving.

14:03.533 --> 14:04.433
Come on.

14:04.466 --> 14:05.601
I'm driving.

14:07.136 --> 14:08.304
Whatever, man.

14:11.541 --> 14:12.776
Love you.

14:12.808 --> 14:14.010
Whatever.

14:25.321 --> 14:26.490
I told Teryn.

14:27.389 --> 14:28.457
You what?

14:28.490 --> 14:29.793
I told Teryn.

14:29.826 --> 14:31.528
Why
would you do that?

14:39.701 --> 14:41.404
Why would you tell her?

14:41.437 --> 14:42.739
Why would you tell her?

14:42.772 --> 14:44.574
'Cause she's my sister.

14:44.606 --> 14:46.709
She's
gonna tell your Mom.

14:46.743 --> 14:47.611
She's gonna tell your Mom.

14:47.644 --> 14:48.544
No, she's not.

14:49.745 --> 14:52.415
Well, just don't
be surprised when we get there

14:52.448 --> 14:54.283
and your Mom already knows.

14:54.317 --> 14:55.818
She won't.

14:55.851 --> 14:58.687
So we're taking
the 26 to get there?

14:58.721 --> 15:00.090
Nope.

15:00.123 --> 15:01.291
Why?

15:01.323 --> 15:04.327
Because I thought we could
take the scenic route for once.

15:05.562 --> 15:07.063
You know
it's gonna take

15:07.096 --> 15:08.731
a lot longer to get there.

15:08.764 --> 15:09.633
No, it won't.

15:11.333 --> 15:12.435
- It will.
- Not.

15:12.469 --> 15:13.770
- It will.
- Not.

15:13.802 --> 15:15.105
- Mm-hm, it will.
- Not.

15:15.138 --> 15:15.705
- It will.
- Not.

15:15.738 --> 15:16.573
- It will.
- Not.

15:16.605 --> 15:17.441
- Will.
- Not.

15:17.474 --> 15:18.342
- Will.
- Not.

15:22.211 --> 15:23.346
Stop it!

15:23.379 --> 15:25.282
Are we
going, let's go!

15:25.315 --> 15:26.550
- Stop.
- Come on!

15:28.750 --> 15:31.154
And we're off.

15:32.254 --> 15:33.355
Are you recording right now?

15:33.389 --> 15:35.192
Yes, Ash, yes, I
am recording you right now.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.692
Well stop, I don't
look good right now.

15:36.725 --> 15:38.294
I disagree, babe.

15:38.327 --> 15:40.596
I think you look pretty
fucking foxy right now.

15:40.629 --> 15:41.764
Oh my god.

15:41.798 --> 15:43.332
So just
own it, alright?

15:43.365 --> 15:44.734
Let me see it, come on.

15:44.767 --> 15:47.838
Let's see those beautiful
lips of yours, come on.

15:47.870 --> 15:49.438
- I said no, stop.
- Come on, let me

15:49.471 --> 15:51.475
get a close up.
I'm gonna pinch your titty.

15:51.508 --> 15:54.110
Quit it dick, I'm driving.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.447
- Babe, I...
- Don't.

15:57.480 --> 16:00.216
I really need to
go to the bathroom right now.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.384
Well, hold it.

16:01.417 --> 16:03.253
Babe, I
really, really need

16:03.285 --> 16:05.488
- to go to the bathroom right now.
- Hold it!

16:05.522 --> 16:07.824
Okay, I
really, really need

16:07.856 --> 16:09.225
to go to the bathroom right now.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.826
You want me to hold it?

16:10.860 --> 16:12.028
Are you serious right now?

16:12.061 --> 16:13.629
Okay, I'm gonna
get a kidney stone, all right?

16:13.663 --> 16:14.630
There's a gas station
coming up, all right,

16:14.663 --> 16:17.333
and I just really need
to go to the bathroom!

16:19.335 --> 16:21.538
Well, if Christmas
wasn't enough on your mind,

16:21.571 --> 16:25.774
it looks like winter is going
to be a little off this year.

16:25.807 --> 16:28.144
Record high temperatures
reaching well over

16:28.177 --> 16:30.379
in the mid-high one hundreds.

16:44.259 --> 16:45.729
Jesus fucking Christ.

17:01.811 --> 17:02.846
Guys, this
is DJ Cassidy...

17:02.879 --> 17:03.947
Did you get me a drink?

17:03.980 --> 17:04.948
What, no.

17:04.980 --> 17:05.915
Did you get me a drink?

17:05.949 --> 17:07.550
You didn't
say you wanted to drink.

17:07.584 --> 17:08.951
I want a soda.

17:08.983 --> 17:10.519
All right, thanks
for telling me now, okay.

17:10.553 --> 17:11.688
And jalapeno chips.

17:11.721 --> 17:13.454
Soda
and jalapeno chips.

17:13.489 --> 17:14.656
Yeah, since I'm here.

17:14.690 --> 17:16.960
Babe, I really don't
wanna go back inside there.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.327
Please babe?

17:18.361 --> 17:18.962
You're
really gonna make me

17:18.993 --> 17:19.929
go back in there, huh?

17:19.962 --> 17:20.864
For your fucking jalapeno chips?

17:20.896 --> 17:22.231
Jalapeno chips, my favorite.

17:22.265 --> 17:23.233
You're
gonna make me do this?

17:23.266 --> 17:24.601
Yeah, yeah, I'm starving.

17:24.634 --> 17:25.568
Are you sure?

17:25.602 --> 17:26.502
Hurry up, gotta go!

17:57.634 --> 18:00.002
Now how long was she gone

18:00.036 --> 18:04.908
before you and your family
noticed something was off?

18:07.644 --> 18:10.012
After we realized she hadn't
contacted us for two days,

18:10.046 --> 18:13.350
we contacted the police.

18:13.383 --> 18:16.318
And did the
police do anything?

18:16.352 --> 18:18.788
Yeah, they filed
a police report

18:18.820 --> 18:22.491
and said they do their
best to find her.

18:23.726 --> 18:24.928
Their best.

18:30.066 --> 18:32.501
Now, how do you feel
now that this building

18:32.535 --> 18:34.271
is being torn down?

18:34.304 --> 18:35.772
Absolutely nothing.

18:41.743 --> 18:43.512
It feels great.

18:43.546 --> 18:45.449
But it's not gonna
bring my sister back.

18:46.816 --> 18:49.452
How long has it been since
your sister's disappearance?

18:50.486 --> 18:51.688
She didn't disappear.

18:52.555 --> 18:53.824
That fucker got her.

18:55.857 --> 18:57.993
We can't cuss live.

18:58.027 --> 18:58.894
I'm sorry.

18:59.761 --> 19:03.866
So what do you
feel really happened?

19:05.968 --> 19:07.437
It's really obvious.

19:08.637 --> 19:11.474
The whole city knows
he still lives there.

19:12.709 --> 19:13.576
Somewhere.

19:18.114 --> 19:20.683
He as in Ed Crow?

19:21.983 --> 19:24.953
Ed Hacksaw Crow.

19:24.987 --> 19:26.490
He killed my little sister.

19:29.791 --> 19:32.961
Do you feel that
your little sister

19:32.994 --> 19:36.365
is still in this building?

19:36.398 --> 19:37.333
Fucking a, I do.

19:38.634 --> 19:41.805
Sorry, yes I do.

19:42.771 --> 19:44.606
I believe he fucking killed her

19:44.640 --> 19:46.910
and all these fucking
followers that follow him

19:46.942 --> 19:51.815
like some fucking cult helped
him fucking kidnap her.

19:53.148 --> 19:57.787
Now if you, Richard Hill,
could do anything to this man,

20:02.592 --> 20:05.061
if you could say
anything to this man

20:05.094 --> 20:07.898
in front of millions of
watchers in this world,

20:09.766 --> 20:10.734
what would you say?

20:14.670 --> 20:16.907
The camera's right there,
what would you say?

20:19.075 --> 20:20.777
I wouldn't say anything.

20:21.911 --> 20:23.346
You wouldn't?

20:24.680 --> 20:27.917
I would do to him what
he did to my sister.

20:27.950 --> 20:29.119
Okay.

20:29.152 --> 20:32.588
I'd cut him up with
his own fucking hacksaw!

20:33.623 --> 20:34.524
Okay, that's it.

20:36.726 --> 20:39.062
Okay, that's it.

20:40.663 --> 20:44.634
The people here need
to know the truth.

20:44.666 --> 20:49.405
They think he's dead or never
existed, but I know the truth.

20:49.439 --> 20:51.775
He's fucking real and
all of his followers,

20:51.807 --> 20:53.910
they're all fucking in on it.

20:53.942 --> 20:55.846
- Stop recording, dumbass!
- Sorry.

20:56.945 --> 20:58.481
There's a fucking
kid out here.

21:01.517 --> 21:04.520
- They're all in on it.
- Stop recording, dumbass.

21:04.554 --> 21:08.525
They help him take people
and they fucking kill,

21:08.557 --> 21:09.459
don't touch me,
you fucking prick!

21:09.491 --> 21:10.527
Hey, this is my show.

21:10.559 --> 21:11.927
I don't give a shit.

21:11.961 --> 21:13.930
People need to know, they
need to know the truth.

21:13.962 --> 21:15.531
People are dying in here.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.534
They're tearing down this
building after Christmas,

21:17.567 --> 21:19.803
- you know this!
- That's not gonna stop him!

21:19.836 --> 21:22.704
That's not gonna, he's
not going to go away.

21:22.738 --> 21:23.940
Okay, okay, that's it.

21:23.972 --> 21:25.474
This interview is over.

21:25.508 --> 21:26.209
You can't fucking kill him.

21:26.241 --> 21:27.810
You can't fucking kill evil!

21:27.844 --> 21:28.778
You can't...

21:42.692 --> 21:45.228
That is gonna get
old really fast.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.229
Come on, babe.

21:46.261 --> 21:47.663
I just got the fucking camera.

21:47.696 --> 21:48.730
I'm experimenting
with the settings.

21:48.763 --> 21:49.765
I'm just getting used to it.

21:49.798 --> 21:51.201
I'm trying to figure it out.

21:51.233 --> 21:52.701
Come on, just stop being
a fucking Grinch, alright?

21:52.734 --> 21:53.902
Come on.

21:53.935 --> 21:55.237
I'm not a Grinch,

21:55.270 --> 21:56.538
I just don't like the
way I look right now

21:56.571 --> 21:57.573
for you to be recording me.

21:57.606 --> 21:58.674
You know I love you

21:58.708 --> 22:00.177
stuffing in your
mouth like that.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.782
You know how I love to see
you stuffing your mouth.

22:05.815 --> 22:08.618
With chips, with chips, come on.

23:51.820 --> 23:53.822
Hey, I was
listening to that.

23:57.727 --> 23:59.629
Not the best thing to
hear before Christmas, guys,

23:59.662 --> 24:01.965
but the city's mayor has
issued a statement today

24:01.998 --> 24:03.932
that the building
on 21st and Grape

24:03.965 --> 24:06.935
will in fact be torn down
right after Christmas.

24:06.969 --> 24:09.105
I know it doesn't bring
back your loved ones,

24:09.137 --> 24:11.707
but it certainly eliminates
that horrible place

24:11.740 --> 24:15.243
from ever standing tall
in this fine city of ours.

24:15.277 --> 24:17.713
So finally the home to the
most notorious murderer

24:17.747 --> 24:20.717
in history, Ed Crow,
will be gone forever.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.987
Now back to something a
little more cheerful, huh?

24:24.019 --> 24:26.321
I'm going to play one more
song before I head out

24:26.355 --> 24:28.790
and Mandy comes in and
covers the next round.

24:28.824 --> 24:31.259
That's right, your
local favorite Mandy.

24:31.292 --> 24:33.395
I'm heading off on
vacation for two weeks,

24:33.429 --> 24:35.098
but Mandy will be
in to cover for me

24:35.131 --> 24:36.966
and make sure we pay
the bills around here,

24:36.999 --> 24:38.701
'cause somebody's got to do it.

24:38.733 --> 24:40.403
But first, this next song

24:40.435 --> 24:42.371
for all my first time
couples out there,

24:42.404 --> 24:45.208
during the best
time of the year.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.977
That's right, I'm your
favorite, DJ Cassidy,

24:48.009 --> 24:50.313
and this is your favorite
station to listen to

24:50.346 --> 24:54.750
on the road, while at work,
live all day at HC Radio.

24:54.784 --> 24:55.818
We're so going.

24:55.851 --> 24:57.420
No, we are not going.

24:57.452 --> 24:58.721
Nope, we're going.

24:58.753 --> 24:59.655
It's fucking insane.

24:59.689 --> 25:01.157
It's fucking, it's gonna be fun.

25:01.190 --> 25:02.191
They're gonna tear it down soon.

25:02.223 --> 25:03.759
It's really fucking cool.

25:03.792 --> 25:04.693
Come on, I can get all
the footage on my camera.

25:04.727 --> 25:05.428
It's gonna be sick.

25:05.461 --> 25:07.029
Are you deaf, I said no

25:07.063 --> 25:08.431
and they said the
building was sealed off...

25:08.463 --> 25:09.665
No, they said they're

25:09.699 --> 25:10.432
tearing it down after Christmas.

25:10.465 --> 25:12.134
Okay, it's gonna be gone soon.

25:12.167 --> 25:13.068
- No.
- Why?

25:14.170 --> 25:15.171
Why, why?

25:16.204 --> 25:17.673
- We're not going?
- Why?

25:20.041 --> 25:22.345
Well, one, we have
to get to my parents

25:22.377 --> 25:23.779
and tell them the big news.

25:23.813 --> 25:25.448
And two, I'm not running
around in some building

25:25.480 --> 25:27.049
where some shit went down.

25:28.183 --> 25:30.420
- Ashley?
- Don't.

25:30.452 --> 25:34.923
- Ashley?
- It's not gonna work, Tommy.

26:37.118 --> 26:40.355
Heart crushed.

26:41.790 --> 26:44.226
That's what this
supposed legend, Ed Crow,

26:44.259 --> 26:46.796
has done to folks
in this glory sick.

26:50.932 --> 26:55.371
I'll just like,
did you get that?

26:55.403 --> 26:58.875
Hurt, crushed,

26:58.907 --> 27:01.777
that's what this
legend, Ed Crow,

27:01.810 --> 27:05.013
has done to folks
in his glories.

27:05.047 --> 27:07.150
I would just like
to take the time

27:07.182 --> 27:10.086
to thank Mr. Richard Hill

27:10.118 --> 27:11.453
for coming on The Hart Show.

27:14.155 --> 27:17.559
Your family will have justice.

27:17.593 --> 27:22.332
Your family will be
happy once again.

27:23.598 --> 27:27.369
Thank you for coming on
The Hart Show, Mr. Hill.

27:30.138 --> 27:31.807
This building that
I'm standing next to

27:31.840 --> 27:35.110
will be torn down to
absolutely nothing,

27:35.144 --> 27:37.579
down to the fucking ground.

27:37.613 --> 27:38.480
Excuse me.

27:39.647 --> 27:42.985
Pavement, it's flat pavement,
turned into a parking lot.

27:44.118 --> 27:48.190
I'm sorry, just, it
hurts me terribly

27:48.223 --> 27:51.293
when good, hardworking
Americans like Mr. Hill

27:51.326 --> 27:53.262
have to suffer like this.

27:57.031 --> 27:57.900
Hey, come here.

27:59.300 --> 28:02.104
Now, if there is an Ed Crow,

28:02.136 --> 28:07.109
if there is the supposed
followers of Ed Crow out there,

28:08.576 --> 28:12.315
you hear this, we're
coming for you.

28:12.347 --> 28:14.983
And the light's about
to shine on you,

28:15.017 --> 28:16.919
if you're still in there.

28:16.951 --> 28:19.622
And cockroaches run out
when the light's on.

28:19.654 --> 28:21.624
So be ready.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.158
Cause we're coming in,
we're going to tear

28:23.192 --> 28:26.162
this whole goddamn thing
down on your faces.

28:28.263 --> 28:31.033
I'm Max Hart and this
is The Hart Show.

28:32.334 --> 28:36.105
Till this time after
Christmas, we'll be here,

28:36.137 --> 28:39.074
live, when we bring down this
motherfucker to the ground.

28:41.509 --> 28:44.446
And who fucking is talking
across the goddamn street

28:44.480 --> 28:46.115
during my video.

28:46.147 --> 28:49.651
'Cause your dick is
so small, little dick.

28:49.684 --> 28:51.988
He could see my dick
all the way from here.

28:52.020 --> 28:53.423
What the fuck are you saying?

28:54.423 --> 28:56.025
It's over, done.

28:56.057 --> 28:57.425
Right now it's done?

28:57.459 --> 29:00.062
It's done when I say it's
done, this is The Hart Show.

29:00.095 --> 29:02.398
Oh, we got to wrap
up now, I'm Max Hart,

29:02.431 --> 29:05.268
we're going to see you
this time after Christmas,

29:05.300 --> 29:08.437
when we tear this
motherfucker to the ground.

29:58.086 --> 29:59.955
So are you gonna
ignore me all night?

30:01.623 --> 30:02.725
What?

30:02.758 --> 30:05.028
Are you gonna
ignore me all night?

30:06.161 --> 30:08.631
No, I'm not
ignoring you at all.

30:10.231 --> 30:11.500
Okay, let's go.

30:14.369 --> 30:15.370
Go where?

30:15.403 --> 30:16.372
You know where.

30:18.507 --> 30:19.741
What, now?

30:19.775 --> 30:22.111
No idiot, tomorrow.

30:23.479 --> 30:24.346
But I
thought you didn't wanna

30:24.380 --> 30:25.748
go to the building.

30:25.780 --> 30:30.252
Well, I mean the road trip
was my idea so I feel bad.

30:31.386 --> 30:33.154
We really
don't have to go

30:33.188 --> 30:34.257
if you don't wanna go.

30:36.357 --> 30:37.993
Really, it's fine.

30:38.027 --> 30:39.729
It's fine, it's okay.

30:39.761 --> 30:42.097
You really want to
go, so let's go.

30:42.131 --> 30:43.365
Do you still want to go?

30:43.398 --> 30:46.101
Fuck yeah,
I still wanna go.

30:46.134 --> 30:48.237
It's not that far
from your Mom's anyway

30:49.471 --> 30:52.575
so it's probably about
at least an hour out.

30:58.680 --> 31:01.116
I did like the road
trip, it was fun.

31:01.150 --> 31:04.420
I did get to get some
things on my camera, so,

31:05.753 --> 31:10.058
but would've got there a lot
faster if we took a plane.

31:11.759 --> 31:13.261
That's just me, all right,

31:13.295 --> 31:17.166
I mean, hey, I'm not pointing
any fingers at anybody,

31:17.199 --> 31:20.403
but you know, still
love you, babe.

31:20.435 --> 31:21.703
Well, we wouldn't be
able to do this anyways

31:21.737 --> 31:25.106
in the future, we're
gonna be pretty busy.

31:25.140 --> 31:26.542
Busy.

31:26.575 --> 31:29.144
Yeah, when we have kids.

31:29.178 --> 31:32.148
Busy, uh-huh, as in,

31:32.181 --> 31:33.816
you do know that just
because you have a kid

31:33.848 --> 31:35.417
doesn't mean you
can't go anywhere.

31:35.451 --> 31:36.719
You can still do things.

31:36.751 --> 31:40.255
People go to a lot of
places with their kids.

31:40.288 --> 31:41.390
But it's a lot harder.

31:41.423 --> 31:42.290
Yeah,
it's a little harder,

31:42.324 --> 31:44.760
but we'll make it work.

31:47.195 --> 31:50.499
Kids as in more than one?

31:50.531 --> 31:52.134
That's usually
what that means?

31:52.166 --> 31:55.303
Well let's just see
how it goes with one, okay?

31:55.336 --> 31:57.405
If I can keep something
alive for longer than a year,

31:57.439 --> 31:59.075
then we can talk.

31:59.107 --> 31:59.741
Nope.

32:03.679 --> 32:05.515
I'm not
having five kids.

32:07.215 --> 32:08.850
Never said we're
having five kids.

32:08.884 --> 32:10.053
Or four.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.121
One is good.

32:12.855 --> 32:13.722
One is good.

32:14.890 --> 32:17.159
So did
you tell your Dad?

32:17.192 --> 32:18.359
What was that?

32:18.393 --> 32:20.196
Did you tell your Dad?

32:20.229 --> 32:23.199
What, about us?

32:23.231 --> 32:25.801
- Yeah.
- I did.

32:26.902 --> 32:28.136
And how did it go?

32:29.637 --> 32:31.673
All right,
that's all that matters,

32:31.707 --> 32:33.375
but yeah, I don't talk to him

32:33.407 --> 32:35.510
like you talked to
your parents, okay?

32:37.846 --> 32:41.817
Doesn't really matter what he
said or what he thought, okay?

32:41.849 --> 32:45.221
Guys, we don't really
talk about our feelings.

32:45.253 --> 32:49.625
You two need to work out
whatever it is that's going on.

32:49.657 --> 32:52.293
Me and Dad, we're
really not the talking type.

32:52.326 --> 32:57.232
So you know this
already, so, okay.

32:59.535 --> 33:00.369
I'll try.

33:02.403 --> 33:03.806
I really will, I'll try.

33:08.676 --> 33:11.279
Our kids are gonna know
who their grandfather is.

33:16.218 --> 33:16.885
Okay.

33:18.854 --> 33:20.422
I'll try.

33:20.454 --> 33:21.789
I really will, I'll try.

33:21.823 --> 33:24.627
Are you gonna be on
that camera all night or...

33:24.660 --> 33:25.528
Why?

33:26.827 --> 33:29.264
Because it's either going
to be me or the camera.

33:32.901 --> 33:34.403
Yeah, is
that a trick question?

33:50.952 --> 33:52.288
This is stupid.

33:52.320 --> 33:53.555
We look like a
bunch of jackasses

33:53.588 --> 33:55.390
standing in front
of this building.

33:57.326 --> 33:59.495
Looks like
a full human bladder

33:59.528 --> 34:01.329
exploded all over the wall.

34:02.631 --> 34:04.767
It looks like the bathroom
when you don't clean it, honey.

34:04.799 --> 34:05.567
Cute!

34:07.336 --> 34:08.603
Are you
sure about this?

34:08.637 --> 34:10.907
It's probably all made
up bullshit anyways.

34:23.018 --> 34:24.887
Hey honey,
after we get married,

34:24.920 --> 34:28.623
do you think maybe we could
move into a house like this one?

34:28.657 --> 34:31.226
Oh, that's lovely,
look at those windows.

34:32.027 --> 34:33.262
Oh man, this is perfect.

34:33.295 --> 34:34.262
We don't even have to, yeah,

34:34.295 --> 34:35.998
it doesn't even need any
touching up or anything.

34:36.030 --> 34:37.967
This is ready, babe, right?

34:38.000 --> 34:39.934
Hey, you can raise
your five kids here.

34:39.967 --> 34:42.237
They each get a
floor, look at that.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.742
Hey, you can raise your
five kids here, honey.

34:46.775 --> 34:48.643
Isn't this nice?

34:49.777 --> 34:52.246
They can come out here
and pee on the wall too,

34:52.280 --> 34:55.016
add a little art to the wall,
you know, potty train them.

34:55.050 --> 34:55.952
Yeah, it'd be fun.

35:07.295 --> 35:09.998
Stairs, stairs, stairs,
we got stairs, babe.

35:10.032 --> 35:13.936
Alright, just hop over
there, climb up the stairs.

35:13.969 --> 35:16.505
Come on, babe, babe, babe,

35:16.538 --> 35:20.876
hop over the fence and
climb up the stairs.

35:20.909 --> 35:24.947
Come on, hop over the
fence, climb up the stairs.

35:32.753 --> 35:34.322
We're leaving.

35:34.356 --> 35:36.259
Leaving,
we just got here.

35:38.592 --> 35:41.896
Well I'm not
waiting forever and I wanna go.

35:43.597 --> 35:46.302
You wanted
to drive back home.

35:46.335 --> 35:48.838
You said it wouldn't
rain, it did.

35:51.472 --> 35:52.708
Who said it wouldn't rain?

35:53.842 --> 35:55.077
It wasn't that bad.

35:55.110 --> 35:56.711
Yeah, right.

35:59.114 --> 36:00.949
But it is
pretty though, right?

36:00.981 --> 36:02.317
No, it's not pretty.

36:02.351 --> 36:03.818
It's fucking raining
it's fucking ugly.

36:03.851 --> 36:05.320
Who are you, Robert Smith?

36:06.487 --> 36:08.423
The pictures of
the raindrops are beautiful.

36:08.456 --> 36:09.692
Fucking girls.

36:09.724 --> 36:11.559
Oh, now you like to take the,

36:11.592 --> 36:13.594
oh yeah, now you
like the camera,

36:13.628 --> 36:14.963
oh, now we're taking pictures,

36:14.996 --> 36:17.532
oh, now that it's
raining outside.

36:17.565 --> 36:18.733
It's so beautiful.

36:18.766 --> 36:21.736
We stopped because
you wanted to take pictures.

36:22.871 --> 36:25.041
Having fun getting
your pictures?

36:26.608 --> 36:28.711
Yes.

36:28.744 --> 36:30.079
Very nice,
very nice, honey.

36:30.112 --> 36:31.313
Very Texas Chainsaw.

36:31.347 --> 36:33.982
Maybe you can post that one on
your Instagram or something.

36:34.014 --> 36:34.884
You would.

36:38.954 --> 36:40.756
There's so much junk everywhere.

36:43.391 --> 36:46.361
Are we gonna do
something that I want to do yet?

36:47.695 --> 36:50.598
Well, yeah, and?

36:51.932 --> 36:54.503
Yeah, I get shit
'cause I wanna stop somewhere,

36:54.536 --> 36:56.472
but oh, Ashley wants to stop.

36:56.505 --> 36:57.373
Oh yeah, of course.

36:58.574 --> 37:01.943
There's a pizza parlor down
the street around the corner.

37:01.976 --> 37:05.780
So I'm going to
eat, you have fun.

37:05.813 --> 37:07.148
Eat,
where are you going?

37:07.181 --> 37:08.549
Bye.

37:08.583 --> 37:09.385
This place
is gonna be gone soon,

37:09.418 --> 37:10.385
all right, come on!

37:11.186 --> 37:13.021
Fuck, god damn it.

37:29.204 --> 37:30.706
It's right there.

37:30.739 --> 37:31.639
Right there, I can see it.

37:31.672 --> 37:32.907
That's the fucking way in.

37:32.940 --> 37:35.410
We just gotta just
crawl the fuck under,

37:36.710 --> 37:39.013
go up that ladder, that
that's the way in right there.

37:44.885 --> 37:47.054
Shit, fuck.

37:47.088 --> 37:51.794
Ah, shit, fuck, fuck, shit.

37:53.128 --> 37:54.830
Hey, can you order me something?

37:56.097 --> 37:57.633
Hey, did you get inside or?

37:57.666 --> 38:00.469
No, I did not find a
way inside the building.

38:02.103 --> 38:04.005
Can you order me
something, please?

38:05.940 --> 38:06.841
Yeah, I'm fine.

38:08.043 --> 38:10.179
If you could please
order me something,

38:10.211 --> 38:13.715
I'm actually really
hungry, please.

38:14.715 --> 38:16.184
Yeah, that's fine, you know me,

38:16.217 --> 38:18.586
- pepperoni, mushroom...
- What are you doing?

38:18.619 --> 38:21.489
Holy fucking
shit, what the fuck, man?

38:21.523 --> 38:23.759
What's your problem, man?

38:28.996 --> 38:30.799
Yeah, I know that.

38:32.601 --> 38:34.702
So what do you do?

38:34.735 --> 38:36.971
None of your
fucking business, man.

38:38.907 --> 38:40.509
Yeah and stop following me.

38:44.278 --> 38:45.213
Fucking asshole.

38:49.751 --> 38:52.153
There's no coming out again.

39:01.161 --> 39:02.063
I know the way inside!

39:09.036 --> 39:10.638
Yeah, I'm listening.

39:17.045 --> 39:18.047
- 50!
- What?

39:20.614 --> 39:21.883
- $50.
- $50?

39:21.916 --> 39:23.585
I know a way in.

39:23.617 --> 39:26.087
Okay, that's great.

39:28.757 --> 39:31.159
Look, all I have is a 20, okay?

39:31.192 --> 39:34.862
I don't have a 50,
so if you know a way.

39:34.896 --> 39:35.764
Sold!

39:38.666 --> 39:40.235
Oh, so
we're going now?

39:41.603 --> 39:44.673
Look Ashley, Ashley,
I got a way inside.

39:44.706 --> 39:47.276
Someone's gonna help
me inside the building.

39:47.309 --> 39:49.011
I know you ordered the
food, just hold onto it.

39:49.043 --> 39:51.079
I found a way
inside the building.

39:52.012 --> 39:54.181
No, you can stay there and eat

39:54.215 --> 39:56.718
but I'm going
inside the building.

39:56.751 --> 39:57.653
You coming?

39:57.686 --> 39:58.253
No, no, I'm not.

39:58.286 --> 39:59.621
No, I'm not.

39:59.653 --> 40:00.621
You eat the food, I
know you got it for me.

40:00.655 --> 40:01.957
I'll eat it later, all right?

40:01.989 --> 40:04.091
There's a guy right now
who's gonna take me in, okay?

40:04.125 --> 40:05.960
What do you know
about this place?

40:07.128 --> 40:08.063
Just a
guy named Ed Crow

40:08.096 --> 40:09.197
used to work in this hospital,

40:09.230 --> 40:10.699
killed a bunch of people.

40:10.731 --> 40:12.900
And that people, he had some,

40:12.934 --> 40:15.070
I dunno, he had some
sort of a cult thing.

40:15.103 --> 40:16.905
I just heard about
it on the radio.

40:19.974 --> 40:22.177
And you still want
to go down in there?

40:22.210 --> 40:23.845
It's all just
made up bullshit, dude.

40:23.878 --> 40:25.981
There's no such
thing as Ed Crow.

40:26.014 --> 40:27.883
Okay, maybe someone got
hurt a long time ago,

40:27.916 --> 40:31.954
but it's bullshit.

40:31.987 --> 40:32.820
What is this, man?

40:32.853 --> 40:33.954
I paid you, dude.

40:33.989 --> 40:35.691
You're just gonna stand there
or you gonna show me in?

40:35.724 --> 40:37.593
This is as far as I go.

40:37.626 --> 40:40.862
Everything you want
is through that door.

40:40.894 --> 40:42.697
I already tried
that door already, man,

40:42.731 --> 40:45.067
and the other one and
they're all fucking locked.

40:49.903 --> 40:50.838
Is there even?

40:52.407 --> 40:54.009
Hey man, what, this isn't cool.

40:55.175 --> 40:56.010
What the hell?

40:57.012 --> 40:58.614
Where the fuck did he go?

40:59.414 --> 41:01.050
Fucking asshole took my money.

41:03.952 --> 41:05.721
The door is locked.

42:22.931 --> 42:24.099
Where are you?

42:25.233 --> 42:26.768
Honey, down here.

42:26.800 --> 42:28.737
Tommy, I
can barely see shit.

42:28.769 --> 42:31.338
Keep walking
down, keep going.

42:31.371 --> 42:33.407
Tommy, I do
not wanna be in here.

42:33.440 --> 42:35.743
Keep
walking down, come on.

42:35.777 --> 42:37.746
Further, all the way down here.

42:37.778 --> 42:41.148
It's bullshit, man,
there's nothing in here.

42:41.181 --> 42:43.117
There's nothing in here.

42:44.219 --> 42:45.487
Look, I know you
don't want to be here.

42:45.519 --> 42:46.822
I'm just going to go
through really, really fast,

42:46.855 --> 42:48.056
I promise, and
then we're leaving.

42:48.088 --> 42:49.356
All right, I know you
don't want to be here.

42:49.389 --> 42:50.357
It's a once in a lifetime
thing, all right?

42:50.391 --> 42:51.992
Please just let me do this.

42:52.025 --> 42:54.730
Five minutes, five minutes,
five minutes, tops.

42:54.762 --> 42:55.963
I promise five minutes.

42:55.996 --> 42:57.298
Tommy, I don't like this.

42:57.331 --> 42:58.866
Just come with me.

42:58.900 --> 43:00.936
Someone is going
to notice a metal bar

43:00.969 --> 43:01.903
on the ground up there.

43:01.936 --> 43:03.204
Just come with me.

43:03.237 --> 43:05.272
In 10 minutes, I'm leaving.

43:05.306 --> 43:07.375
Babe, are
you gonna come or what?

43:07.407 --> 43:08.277
Ash!

43:09.244 --> 43:11.012
- Nope.
- Ash!

43:11.045 --> 43:12.280
I'm staying right here.

43:22.422 --> 43:23.824
Ash, are you coming?

43:25.159 --> 43:26.527
What the fuck!

43:26.561 --> 43:30.231
Hey asshole, get your
fucking hands off her, man!

43:30.264 --> 43:33.000
What the, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

43:33.034 --> 43:34.369
Stop, stop, hey!

43:35.836 --> 43:37.371
Get the fuck away from her, man,

43:37.405 --> 43:39.441
get your fucking
hands off my girl!

43:39.474 --> 43:40.876
Ash, fucking push him away!

43:40.909 --> 43:42.443
Get the fuck away from her!

43:42.476 --> 43:45.880
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing, man?

43:45.914 --> 43:48.917
Hey, hey, get her the
fuck out here, man!

43:48.949 --> 43:51.519
Hey, hey, hey, come on!

43:51.552 --> 43:55.156
Open this fucking door,
get her out of here, man!

43:55.190 --> 43:56.925
What the fuck are you doing?

43:56.958 --> 44:00.996
Hey, come on, hey, what the
fuck are you doing, man?

44:01.028 --> 44:04.166
Ash, hey, get her the
fuck out here man!

44:04.199 --> 44:05.334
Hey, hey, hey!

44:06.467 --> 44:08.302
I'm coming, Ashley,
I'm coming, baby,

44:08.335 --> 44:10.571
I'm coming to get you,
don't worry, hold on, baby.

44:10.605 --> 44:13.375
I'm coming, I'm coming,
Ash, I'm coming,

44:13.407 --> 44:15.509
I'll be there soon, alright!

44:34.896 --> 44:35.564
Ashley!

44:36.530 --> 44:37.599
Ashley, where are you?

44:37.632 --> 44:40.235
Ashley, what the fuck is that?

44:41.635 --> 44:43.038
What the fuck is that?

44:43.070 --> 44:44.239
What the fuck is this?

44:45.206 --> 44:46.341
What the fuck is this?

44:46.373 --> 44:47.408
Happy.

44:59.519 --> 45:00.621
Happy?

45:00.655 --> 45:02.858
Jesus fucking
Christ, are you okay?

45:02.891 --> 45:04.326
Hey man, are you okay?

45:04.358 --> 45:05.192
Are you okay over there?

45:05.226 --> 45:07.128
Hey, oh fuck, God!

45:08.630 --> 45:10.131
Jesus fucking Christ!

46:21.068 --> 46:23.538
Why are you doing this to us?

46:37.217 --> 46:39.086
Please, don't hurt me.

47:06.246 --> 47:08.315
Fuck, no!

48:23.458 --> 48:27.662
I guess this wasn't such
a good idea after all.

48:47.547 --> 48:49.550
Everything started here for me.

48:53.186 --> 48:55.255
My first kill,

48:55.289 --> 48:57.492
I was pretty close to your age.

48:58.759 --> 49:01.728
My hair was a little
longer than yours though.

49:53.181 --> 49:55.684
For a long time,
I always thought

49:56.583 --> 49:57.885
this place would be my tomb.

50:27.847 --> 50:32.786
Every time I tried get out,
something kept calling me back.

50:36.856 --> 50:41.563
Tommy, Tommy, you still with me?

50:46.400 --> 50:50.505
And they think they're
gonna tear this place down?

50:52.005 --> 50:54.742
I'd like to see them try!

51:00.347 --> 51:05.253
Because whatever soul sets
foot inside this place

51:12.726 --> 51:17.731
will be trapped inside
forever with us.

57:49.056 --> 57:50.625
Leave me alone!

01:02:31.637 --> 01:02:32.572
Let me out!

01:02:42.382 --> 01:02:43.317
Let me out!

01:02:53.193 --> 01:02:54.295
Ashley.

01:02:57.697 --> 01:02:58.531
Ashley.

01:03:08.541 --> 01:03:09.543
Go right up.

01:03:10.978 --> 01:03:11.979
Go right up.

01:03:14.146 --> 01:03:16.016
Be one of my children.

01:03:20.519 --> 01:03:22.389
Be one of my children.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.595
Tommy is with us.

01:03:28.628 --> 01:03:30.597
I wanna go home!

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:32.266
Yes he is.

01:03:32.298 --> 01:03:34.501
I wanna go home!

01:03:36.168 --> 01:03:37.670
Why are you fighting me?

01:03:37.704 --> 01:03:40.341
Let me out of here!

01:03:40.373 --> 01:03:42.208
It can all be over.

01:03:42.242 --> 01:03:44.745
Let me out of here!

01:03:44.777 --> 01:03:46.179
Join us.

01:03:47.547 --> 01:03:51.985
Please, please,
just let me out of here.

01:03:53.152 --> 01:03:56.356
Please, I just want
to go home, please.

01:05:45.331 --> 01:05:49.502
Ashley, Ashley, it's okay.

01:05:52.371 --> 01:05:54.407
I feel a lot better now.

01:05:57.577 --> 01:05:59.547
They're really out here.

01:06:01.648 --> 01:06:02.516
They really are.

01:06:04.784 --> 01:06:07.621
Just say yes and
you'll be with me.

01:06:10.657 --> 01:06:12.559
It's me, Ashley, Tommy.

01:07:09.782 --> 01:07:11.351
Are you gonna
help me pack or what?

01:07:11.384 --> 01:07:12.920
No, I'm
taking a shower.

01:07:12.952 --> 01:07:15.456
Get over here,
come and help me pack.

01:07:19.726 --> 01:07:22.563
Soda and jalapeno chips.

01:07:22.596 --> 01:07:25.264
Babe, I really don't
wanna go back inside.

01:07:25.297 --> 01:07:26.432
Please babe?

01:07:26.465 --> 01:07:27.567
You're really gonna
make me go back in there?

01:07:27.601 --> 01:07:29.469
For your fucking jalapeno chips?

01:07:29.501 --> 01:07:30.737
My favorite.
