00:01.376 --> 00:02.336
<i>[female narrator]</i>

00:01.376 --> 00:02.336
<i>Previously on "Gilmore Girls"..</i>

00:02.377 --> 00:04.212
- Luke, will you marry me?

00:02.377 --> 00:04.212
- Yes.

00:04.254 --> 00:05.673
And it should be fully

00:04.254 --> 00:05.673
restored and working by

00:05.714 --> 00:07.257
June 3rd, which by the way

00:05.714 --> 00:07.257
is the date of our wedding.

00:07.299 --> 00:08.425
June 3rd?

00:08.467 --> 00:10.385
- You broke up with me.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.385
- Rory, I love you.

00:10.427 --> 00:11.846
The paper's not gonna come out.

00:11.887 --> 00:14.181
- Of course, it is.

00:11.887 --> 00:14.181
- How? Nothing's done.

00:14.222 --> 00:15.933
Come on, people! Move!

00:15.975 --> 00:17.267
We got a paper to get out!

00:17.309 --> 00:19.394
Paris melted down,

00:17.309 --> 00:19.394
and everyone quit.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.938
So, what? I know this

00:19.436 --> 00:20.938
script backwards and forwards.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.523
I can't believe you

00:20.980 --> 00:22.523
didn't think to call me.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.733
- How we doing on time?

00:22.564 --> 00:24.733
- Uh, bad.

00:24.775 --> 00:25.776
More specifically?

00:25.818 --> 00:27.194
- Ten minutes.

00:25.818 --> 00:27.194
- We'll make it.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.154
Russell, I'm Logan Huntzberger.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.406
<i>Yes,</i> those Huntzbergers.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.492
And that's how we do

00:31.448 --> 00:33.492
it at the<i> Daily News.</i>

00:33.534 --> 00:35.494
[all cheering]

00:35.536 --> 00:36.912
How about I just come

00:35.536 --> 00:36.912
and hang out at the diner?

00:36.954 --> 00:38.246
My diner?

00:38.288 --> 00:40.123
So, uh, who do you

00:38.288 --> 00:40.123
belong to, Caesar?

00:40.165 --> 00:41.959
My father owns the place.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.959
The diner at least.

00:42.001 --> 00:43.418
- Not sure about the land.

00:42.001 --> 00:43.418
- Your<i> father?</i>

00:43.460 --> 00:44.879
My biological father.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.881
- When did you find out?

00:44.920 --> 00:46.881
- Two months ago.

00:46.922 --> 00:48.716
That's a hell of a long

00:46.922 --> 00:48.716
time to go without telling me.

00:48.757 --> 00:49.967
I'm sorry.

00:50.009 --> 00:51.426
If it's all happening too fast

00:51.468 --> 00:52.553
you know,

00:51.468 --> 00:52.553
we could just postpone.

00:52.594 --> 00:53.804
Postpone the wedding?

00:53.846 --> 00:54.847
Maybe I shouldn't..

00:54.889 --> 00:56.264
...cancel everything right away.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.892
Maybe I should just chill out

00:57.933 --> 00:59.935
and-and see what happens.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.935
Is that crazy?

01:02.021 --> 01:04.565
[soft music]

01:04.606 --> 01:06.650
- Roses are amazing, mom.

01:04.606 --> 01:06.650
- Hmm.

01:06.692 --> 01:07.735
Thank you, Lorelai.

01:07.776 --> 01:08.903
I like them too, grandma.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.195
Thank you, Rory.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.780
You are an expert

01:10.237 --> 01:11.780
flower arranger, Emily.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.281
Perhaps you missed your calling.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.200
- Thank you, Richard.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.200
- Well done, everyone.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.369
- Well done!

01:15.242 --> 01:17.369
- Oh, stop it, Lorelai.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.913
Why, I'm just

01:17.411 --> 01:18.913
commenting on how nice

01:18.954 --> 01:20.706
and civil that moment was.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.834
Never mind. Go on, go on.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.834
That was so cute.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.590
- The roses are nice, grandma.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.590
- Already covered that. Move on.

01:29.631 --> 01:32.927
[sighing]

01:29.631 --> 01:32.927
So, Rory...how are

01:29.631 --> 01:32.927
things going at Yale?

01:32.968 --> 01:34.553
They're fine.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.137
I didn't know we were

01:34.595 --> 01:36.137
allowed to talk about Yale.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.472
- Mom.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.472
- 'Oh, no.'

01:37.514 --> 01:39.016
We're allowed to talk about it.

01:39.058 --> 01:40.809
We're just not

01:39.058 --> 01:40.809
allowed to pay for it.

01:40.851 --> 01:41.894
I wonder if we're

01:40.851 --> 01:41.894
allowed to visit it.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.186
Okay, hold on.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.855
Perhaps, if we

01:43.228 --> 01:44.855
dress in disguise.

01:44.897 --> 01:45.981
Guys!

01:46.023 --> 01:47.441
Plastic nose with

01:46.023 --> 01:47.441
glasses attached.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.484
Hey, come on, we were doing

01:47.482 --> 01:49.484
so well there for a while.

01:49.526 --> 01:50.861
Then you had to

01:49.526 --> 01:50.861
start with the Yale.

01:50.903 --> 01:51.946
So we can't talk about Yale.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.572
I should make a list.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.616
What else am I not allowed

01:53.614 --> 01:55.616
to discuss in my house?

01:55.657 --> 01:57.325
No, of course,

01:55.657 --> 01:57.325
you can talk about Yale.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.912
Yale is dad's alma mater

01:57.367 --> 01:59.912
and Rory goes there.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.329
'So we have to talk

01:59.954 --> 02:01.329
about it, okay?'

02:01.371 --> 02:02.706
But maybe not now.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.124
- Fine.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.124
- Fine with me.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.500
Now, I know a lot

02:04.165 --> 02:05.500
of stuff has happened.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.877
But we all agreed we were gonna

02:06.919 --> 02:08.796
put all that behind us

02:06.919 --> 02:08.796
and just move on, okay?

02:08.837 --> 02:10.798
So...let's take a step back

02:10.839 --> 02:12.967
and, uh...start again.

02:13.008 --> 02:16.136
In five, four, three, two..

02:16.177 --> 02:18.513
[sighing]

02:16.177 --> 02:18.513
These roses are amazing, mom.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.599
- Thank you, Lorelai.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.599
- Attagirl.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.267
Your mother has

02:20.641 --> 02:22.267
a way with flowers.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.852
Perhaps, she missed her calling.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.228
Okay, dad, we don't

02:23.894 --> 02:25.228
have to have exactly

02:25.270 --> 02:26.396
the same conversation

02:25.270 --> 02:26.396
we just had.

02:26.438 --> 02:27.815
How am I supposed to know?

02:27.856 --> 02:29.232
You said the same

02:27.856 --> 02:29.232
thing you said.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.484
I was getting the ball rolling.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.944
Lorelai, this is my house.

02:31.986 --> 02:33.320
'I should have

02:31.986 --> 02:33.320
some control over'

02:33.361 --> 02:35.280
what goes on here at some point!

02:35.322 --> 02:36.782
You're raising your

02:35.322 --> 02:36.782
voice again, Richard.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.117
- I am not!

02:36.824 --> 02:38.117
- You are.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.910
And you're raising

02:38.158 --> 02:39.910
your voice to me.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.245
Well, I'm not allowed to raise

02:39.952 --> 02:42.245
it to the people who deserve it.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.164
Five, four, three, two.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.874
I love shrimp!

02:44.205 --> 02:45.874
Who else loves shrimp?

02:45.916 --> 02:47.542
- Me!

02:45.916 --> 02:47.542
- I'm a fan!

02:47.584 --> 02:49.711
- This is ridiculous.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.711
- Lorelai, how's Luke?

02:49.753 --> 02:51.839
- Hey, nice one, mom.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.839
- Thank you.

02:53.172 --> 02:54.675
- Well?

02:53.172 --> 02:54.675
- What?

02:54.716 --> 02:56.969
- Oh, oh, he's fine.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.969
- So you're still engaged?

02:57.011 --> 02:59.346
- Yes, we're still engaged.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.346
- I was just asking.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.723
After all, I haven't gotten

02:59.387 --> 03:01.723
a "save the date" card yet.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.475
If you're engaged,

03:01.765 --> 03:03.475
I assume you're planning

03:03.517 --> 03:05.602
a wedding at some point,

03:03.517 --> 03:05.602
not that I've heard anything.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.604
I will send you

03:05.644 --> 03:07.604
a "save the date" card, mom.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.188
- For?

03:09.230 --> 03:10.482
What date am I saving?

03:10.524 --> 03:12.233
Well, if I, uh,

03:10.524 --> 03:12.233
tell you that now

03:12.275 --> 03:13.861
then what fun will the card be?

03:13.902 --> 03:16.446
I mean, I assume, I'm invited.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.446
I haven't heard.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.948
I haven't heard if I'm invited.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.825
If I'm in the wedding,

03:17.990 --> 03:19.825
if I need a dress.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.576
And now you won't tell me

03:19.867 --> 03:21.576
the date of this wedding

03:21.618 --> 03:23.037
that I may or may

03:21.618 --> 03:23.037
not be invited to.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.204
June 3rd!

03:25.246 --> 03:27.124
- June 3rd?

03:25.246 --> 03:27.124
- Yes, June 3rd, okay?

03:27.166 --> 03:28.416
Are we here June 3rd?

03:28.458 --> 03:30.377
- I believe we are.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.377
- Alright.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.837
June 3rd.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.922
- That's very soon.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.922
- Yeah.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.590
Any specific reason so soon?

03:35.632 --> 03:37.258
- Oh, boy.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.258
- 'June 3rd.'

03:37.300 --> 03:39.720
June 3rd? Richard, June 3rd.

03:39.761 --> 03:40.971
Yes, June 3rd.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.597
Well, it's just so soon.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.851
I mean, we haven't

03:42.639 --> 03:45.851
even seen Luke since..

03:45.893 --> 03:47.310
Richard, when was

03:45.893 --> 03:47.310
the last time we saw Luke?

03:47.352 --> 03:50.064
- Hmm, it's been a while.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.064
- A long while.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.231
Well, you must bring

03:50.105 --> 03:51.231
him to dinner Friday.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.858
What?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.193
Well, the next time we

03:52.900 --> 03:54.193
see him certainly cannot be

03:54.234 --> 03:55.819
as you're walking

03:54.234 --> 03:55.819
down the aisle.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.946
- Well, there's time before--

03:55.861 --> 03:57.946
- 'No, there's not.'

03:57.988 --> 03:59.990
Your father goes out

03:57.988 --> 03:59.990
of town every other week

04:00.032 --> 04:01.658
from now until the end of May.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.243
I have functions every weekend.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.412
Two charity balls,

04:03.284 --> 04:05.412
the zoo auction.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.164
The Hartford

04:05.453 --> 04:07.164
beautification project.

04:07.206 --> 04:08.832
Your father and I bought

04:07.206 --> 04:08.832
a stretch of the highway.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.792
Exit 36 through 38.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.419
So there's literally

04:10.834 --> 04:12.419
no time left.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.379
- It has to be Friday.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.379
- Friday it is.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.630
I don't know if Luke

04:14.421 --> 04:15.630
is available Friday.

04:15.672 --> 04:16.882
Well, tell him he has to be.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.050
- This is family.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.050
- Yeah, but--

04:18.092 --> 04:19.551
He would say no to having dinner

04:19.593 --> 04:21.720
with his future

04:19.593 --> 04:21.720
mother and father-in-law?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.805
Is this really the kind

04:21.762 --> 04:23.805
of man you want in your life?

04:23.847 --> 04:25.348
'Is this really

04:23.847 --> 04:25.348
the kind of man'

04:25.390 --> 04:27.059
'you want to be

04:25.390 --> 04:27.059
Rory's stepfather?'

04:27.101 --> 04:28.227
Yeah, think of the kids.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.644
Luke is not saying no.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.855
- You are?

04:29.686 --> 04:31.855
- No, I'm not saying no, either.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.107
- So, no one's saying no.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.107
- 'Right.'

04:33.148 --> 04:34.816
- So, you're saying yes.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.816
- Yes.

04:34.858 --> 04:37.611
Good. I'll pick up some

04:34.858 --> 04:37.611
"Save The Date" cards tomorrow.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.488
Do you want a color? Because I

04:37.652 --> 04:40.488
think white is the best choice.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.133
Hey, have you

05:39.840 --> 05:41.133
noticed that anything

05:41.175 --> 05:42.509
in a red-wine reduction sauce

05:42.550 --> 05:44.094
leaves you hungry

05:42.550 --> 05:44.094
20 minutes later?

05:44.136 --> 05:45.971
(Rory)

05:44.136 --> 05:45.971
'Especially,

05:44.136 --> 05:45.971
if you don't eat it.'

05:46.013 --> 05:48.140
Did my parents eat

05:46.013 --> 05:48.140
exceptionally slowly tonight?

05:48.182 --> 05:49.599
- 'Yes.'

05:48.182 --> 05:49.599
- They did.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.185
My mother started on

05:49.641 --> 05:51.185
the white-meat portion

05:51.226 --> 05:52.936
of her game hen at 8:15

05:52.978 --> 05:54.646
and did not hit the

05:52.978 --> 05:54.646
drumstick till ten of 9:00.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.273
'Actually, 9:15.'

05:56.315 --> 05:57.607
You've been in there an hour.

05:56.315 --> 05:57.607
What are you doing?

05:57.649 --> 05:59.067
'Facial exercises.'

05:59.109 --> 06:01.153
'The younger I look,

05:59.109 --> 06:01.153
the younger you look.'

06:01.195 --> 06:02.487
Oh, good point.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.780
Hey, do we want

06:03.822 --> 06:05.448
the apple turnovers

06:03.822 --> 06:05.448
or the cherry?

06:05.490 --> 06:06.616
'Yes.'

06:06.658 --> 06:08.285
'Hey, question.'

06:08.327 --> 06:09.619
'Where did June 3rd come from?'

06:09.661 --> 06:10.912
What?

06:10.954 --> 06:12.455
'I thought there

06:10.954 --> 06:12.455
was no June 3rd.'

06:12.497 --> 06:13.748
No, there's a June 3rd.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.042
Just because we

06:13.790 --> 06:15.042
don't get married

06:15.083 --> 06:16.584
on a date doesn't

06:15.083 --> 06:16.584
make it cease to exist.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.087
- 'You know what I mean.'

06:16.626 --> 06:19.087
- I was on the spot.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.755
I just didn't want

06:19.129 --> 06:20.755
to go through the whole

06:20.797 --> 06:21.882
"The Wedding Was Postponed"

06:20.797 --> 06:21.882
explanation.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.175
'Why not?'

06:23.217 --> 06:25.093
Because that now

06:23.217 --> 06:25.093
would lead to the

06:25.135 --> 06:26.803
"what happened?" conversation

06:26.845 --> 06:28.722
which would lead to the

06:26.845 --> 06:28.722
"I told you so" conversation.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.974
And the "what is wrong with you

06:28.763 --> 06:30.974
that you can't close the deal?"

06:31.016 --> 06:32.642
conversation, which would lead

06:32.684 --> 06:35.436
to the "why is Lorelai slamming

06:32.684 --> 06:35.436
her head against the wall?"

06:35.478 --> 06:38.023
conversation.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.023
So I just said June 3rd.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.025
It could still happen,

06:38.065 --> 06:40.025
and if it doesn't

06:40.067 --> 06:41.235
I'll blow up that bridge

06:40.067 --> 06:41.235
when we come to it.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.694
- I get it.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.694
- Thank you.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.529
- Those new sweats?

06:42.736 --> 06:44.529
- Yep, just came out.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.240
- Did you get some for mommy?

06:44.571 --> 06:46.240
- You want some Yale sweats?

06:46.281 --> 06:47.824
No, no, not me,

06:46.281 --> 06:47.824
your other mommy.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.701
The one who raised

06:47.866 --> 06:49.701
you and fed you

06:49.743 --> 06:51.661
and stayed up with you

06:49.743 --> 06:51.661
when you had the measles..

06:51.703 --> 06:52.704
I already put them in your room.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.164
Excellent!

06:54.206 --> 06:55.790
- To cleanse your palate.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.790
- Thank you.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.416
Let's go.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.296
Hey, you know who also

06:59.294 --> 07:01.296
might like a sweatshirt?

07:01.338 --> 07:03.506
They don't make them for dogs.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.506
I already asked.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.260
I did not mean Paul Anka.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.260
He's a Princeton man, anyhow.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.510
Nice loyalty.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.263
I think Christopher

07:07.552 --> 07:09.263
might like one.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.430
Dad? Really?

07:10.471 --> 07:11.973
Yeah, he's paying

07:10.471 --> 07:11.973
your tuition now.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.516
It might be a nice gesture.

07:13.558 --> 07:14.851
Yeah, sure,

07:13.558 --> 07:14.851
I could do that.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.396
- Cool. "Solaris"?

07:14.893 --> 07:17.396
- No, not again.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.189
I'm telling you, there's

07:17.437 --> 07:19.189
a story in there somewhere.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.941
Yeah, the story is you,

07:19.231 --> 07:20.941
calling yourself

07:20.982 --> 07:23.110
Mrs. Clooney for

07:20.982 --> 07:23.110
two-and-a-half hours.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.152
Have you heard

07:23.151 --> 07:24.152
from him lately?

07:24.194 --> 07:25.570
George? Yes, last night.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.988
The Oscar buzz

07:25.612 --> 07:26.988
is really getting to him.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.949
- I'm talking about your dad.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.949
- No.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.575
- Huh?

07:28.990 --> 07:30.575
- What?

07:30.617 --> 07:32.202
Nothing. He's just been

07:30.617 --> 07:32.202
very quiet lately.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.162
- So?

07:32.244 --> 07:34.162
- So it's weird.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.206
Pops up and then disappears

07:34.204 --> 07:36.206
again, that's never good.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.458
Unless he's a groundhog.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.458
Maybe dad's a groundhog.

07:38.499 --> 07:39.667
I wonder what he's up to.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.002
Maybe he's just busy with work.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.796
No, I don't buy it.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.839
Well, maybe he's just doing

07:42.837 --> 07:44.839
what he promised he would do.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.716
What's that?

07:46.758 --> 07:48.760
He's putting up the money and

07:46.758 --> 07:48.760
staying out of everything else.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.971
Hmm. Well, that was

07:48.802 --> 07:50.971
the agreement, wasn't it?

07:51.012 --> 07:53.598
- Yes, it was.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.598
- Huh.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.517
Maybe he is just

07:53.640 --> 07:56.517
doing what we agreed to.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.312
So un-Christopher of him.

07:58.353 --> 07:59.729
People change and

07:58.353 --> 07:59.729
then they get a nice

07:59.771 --> 08:01.356
sweatshirt as a treat.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.899
- Good for him.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.899
- Yep.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.276
Hey, "Bullets Over Broadway."

08:04.318 --> 08:05.986
- "Don't speak."

08:04.318 --> 08:05.986
- If only.

08:06.027 --> 08:09.530
[gasps]

08:06.027 --> 08:09.530
Hey, you like me. Remember that.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.616
Why don't you invite

08:09.572 --> 08:11.616
him to Yale for lunch?

08:11.658 --> 08:14.077
Show him around the campus,

08:11.658 --> 08:14.077
make him feel daddy-ish.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.163
- You think he'd like that?

08:14.119 --> 08:16.163
- I think he'd love that.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.039
Okay. I'll call him tomorrow.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.375
Just don't take

08:18.081 --> 08:20.375
him to the library.

08:20.417 --> 08:23.003
Don't show him all your classes.

08:20.417 --> 08:23.003
Don't make him touch the toe.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.879
- This is my tour.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.879
- I'm just saying.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.714
If he passes out from boredom

08:26.756 --> 08:28.967
he's gonna be a lot harder to

08:26.756 --> 08:28.967
drag around campus than I was.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.845
Seriously, don't speak.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.305
'This is getting ridiculous.'

08:33.347 --> 08:35.056
'Well, I'm completely

08:33.347 --> 08:35.056
out of suggestions.'

08:35.098 --> 08:36.391
How about we call her cellphone

08:36.433 --> 08:37.642
and make up some

08:36.433 --> 08:37.642
kind of emergency?

08:37.684 --> 08:40.228
Would that work?

08:40.270 --> 08:41.896
Okay, hit me with it.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.607
- Big shock. It's about Paris.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.607
- What did she do now?

08:44.649 --> 08:46.443
Nothing, it's what's

08:44.649 --> 08:46.443
been done to her.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.403
The Howell Raines-ing

08:46.485 --> 08:48.403
is complete.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.113
- She's out?

08:48.445 --> 08:50.113
- The board has spoken.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.490
More like screamed.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.825
- Oh, boy! How did she take it?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.825
- She hasn't.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.160
She won't come

08:53.867 --> 08:55.160
out of her bunker.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.786
She's been in there for hours.

08:56.828 --> 08:59.289
Even Hitler came out every

08:56.828 --> 08:59.289
once in a while to walk his dog.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.500
I interrupted her highness

08:59.331 --> 09:01.500
while she was on the phone

09:01.541 --> 09:05.003
and got a 5,000 word lecture

09:01.541 --> 09:05.003
on Robert's rules of order.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.129
Well, she's got to be told.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.506
Then, she's got to come out.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.549
Tear gas!

09:07.547 --> 09:09.549
Where can we find tear gas?

09:09.590 --> 09:10.925
Or we could set

09:09.590 --> 09:10.925
off the fire alarms.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.010
Stand down, everyone.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.761
- I'll tell her.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.761
- Really?

09:13.803 --> 09:16.139
It's probably better that

09:13.803 --> 09:16.139
the person delivering the news

09:16.181 --> 09:18.308
doesn't chuckle with glee

09:16.181 --> 09:18.308
while doing it, Bill.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.352
[chuckling]

09:18.350 --> 09:20.352
I would not chuckle

09:18.350 --> 09:20.352
while doing it.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.354
Oh, my God, that was

09:20.394 --> 09:22.354
completely inadvertent.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.481
Alright, I'm going in.

09:24.523 --> 09:26.400
I know, Mr. Weisner.

09:24.523 --> 09:26.400
It was a complete screw-up.

09:26.441 --> 09:27.484
Here's what happened.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.069
Your ad ran with

09:27.526 --> 09:29.069
the phone number

09:29.110 --> 09:31.446
of the beauty supply

09:29.110 --> 09:31.446
store ad from the next page.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.282
That's why you're getting calls

09:31.488 --> 09:34.282
about hair gel and moisturizers.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.117
Anyway, I really

09:34.324 --> 09:36.117
want you to rest easy

09:36.159 --> 09:38.119
and I hope this

09:36.159 --> 09:38.119
does not interfere

09:38.161 --> 09:39.454
with any financial contributions

09:39.496 --> 09:41.415
that you've been

09:39.496 --> 09:41.415
generous enough to promise.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.665
Alright?

09:42.707 --> 09:44.876
Thank you. Bye.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.586
- This job is 24/7.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.586
- Yeah.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.922
It's not enough to put out

09:46.627 --> 09:48.922
a daily paper about standing

09:48.963 --> 09:50.715
quality without having

09:48.963 --> 09:50.715
to dodge complaints

09:50.757 --> 09:54.052
from uppity alumni calling

09:50.757 --> 09:54.052
over every little mistake.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.720
Weisner threatened

09:54.094 --> 09:55.720
to withhold money

09:55.762 --> 09:57.013
he had already pledged

09:55.762 --> 09:57.013
for the new computers

09:57.055 --> 09:58.765
because his ad was messed up.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.392
I mean, can he even do that?

10:00.434 --> 10:01.684
- I don't know.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.684
- Do you want some soup?

10:01.726 --> 10:03.019
I was just heating up some soup.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.104
There's no ventilation in here.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.022
- I'm careful.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.022
- Right.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.274
Uh, well, no, thank you.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.692
Umm, I just came in here to..

10:09.734 --> 10:11.069
[sighs]

10:09.734 --> 10:11.069
...I was just thinking--

10:11.111 --> 10:13.654
Yeah?

10:13.696 --> 10:15.698
- Five-plus years?

10:13.696 --> 10:15.698
- Hmm.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.243
That we've known each other,

10:15.740 --> 10:18.243
that we've been friends.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.454
- Five-plus.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.454
- That long? Wow.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.829
'Feels like forever ago to me.'

10:21.871 --> 10:24.207
Chilton, the day we met

10:24.249 --> 10:25.750
just a couple of

10:24.249 --> 10:25.750
rosy-cheeked kids.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.419
My face inflamed

10:25.792 --> 10:27.419
easily back then.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.254
Too many tomatoes

10:27.461 --> 10:29.254
and red peppers.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.838
Got off to kind of

10:29.296 --> 10:30.838
a rocky start.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.340
We were competitors.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.301
I get that from my mother.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.301
She's part Viking.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.637
But eventually,

10:34.342 --> 10:37.637
we became pals, good pals.

10:37.678 --> 10:40.223
Because we respected each other.

10:40.265 --> 10:43.768
And supported each other,

10:40.265 --> 10:43.768
in good times and bad.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.728
Did I open this can

10:43.810 --> 10:45.728
today or yesterday?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.397
This is

10:45.770 --> 10:47.397
a not-so-good time, Paris.

10:47.439 --> 10:48.856
I know.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.817
If the hurricanes don't kill us,

10:48.898 --> 10:50.817
the bird flu will.

10:50.858 --> 10:53.694
I mean for you, here,

10:50.858 --> 10:53.694
at the paper.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.574
The board voted you out.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.576
Oh.

10:59.618 --> 11:00.701
I see.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.457
So it's over.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.707
I'm sorry.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.336
I just found out. I'm so sorry.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.671
Well, it's not like

11:09.377 --> 11:11.671
I didn't have a clue

11:11.712 --> 11:13.006
that was a possibility.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.216
It has been pretty

11:13.047 --> 11:15.216
tense around here.

11:15.258 --> 11:18.345
So, are they all out there

11:15.258 --> 11:18.345
excitedly awaiting my perp walk?

11:18.386 --> 11:20.430
Oh, who cares?

11:18.386 --> 11:20.430
Who cares about them?

11:20.472 --> 11:21.931
You don't perp walk.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.931
You're Paris Geller.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.183
You walk tall.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.267
You're better than all of them.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.560
- Really?

11:24.309 --> 11:25.560
- 'Definitely.'

11:25.602 --> 11:28.104
And this job, Paris,

11:25.602 --> 11:28.104
being editor?

11:28.146 --> 11:29.648
You don't need this,

11:28.146 --> 11:29.648
this hassle.

11:29.730 --> 11:30.898
- You're gonna be a doctor.

11:29.730 --> 11:30.898
- Surgeon.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.108
- And a lawyer.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.108
- Judge.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.485
'That's a hell of a workload.'

11:33.527 --> 11:35.278
And the workload here,

11:33.527 --> 11:35.278
the indignities

11:35.320 --> 11:37.405
smoothing the ruffled

11:35.320 --> 11:37.405
feathers of advertisers

11:37.447 --> 11:39.199
covering sports

11:37.447 --> 11:39.199
as if they matter.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.034
'You're exhausted, Paris.'

11:41.075 --> 11:43.244
Stretched thin,

11:41.075 --> 11:43.244
eating soup out of a can.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.538
Soup I don't even like.

11:44.579 --> 11:45.746
This might not be

11:44.579 --> 11:45.746
such a bad thing

11:45.788 --> 11:46.873
leaving this job, huh?

11:46.914 --> 11:48.249
I am pretty tired.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.959
You even look

11:48.291 --> 11:49.959
a little relieved.

11:50.001 --> 11:52.170
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna

11:50.001 --> 11:52.170
give those people a perp walk.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.712
Good. Good attitude.

11:53.754 --> 11:54.797
Let's get out of

11:53.754 --> 11:54.797
this spider hole

11:54.839 --> 11:55.882
and take care of this right now.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.509
I am with you, friend.

11:57.551 --> 11:58.926
You better shut

11:57.551 --> 11:58.926
off the hot plate.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.220
Right.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.559
Everyone, I have

12:03.722 --> 12:05.559
a little announcement.

12:05.600 --> 12:09.270
So if you could gather around,

12:05.600 --> 12:09.270
please. We have an issue.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.189
You see, it has become

12:09.312 --> 12:11.189
increasingly apparent

12:11.231 --> 12:14.317
that I have become the story

12:11.231 --> 12:14.317
here at the Yale Daily News.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.153
And that I have overshadowed

12:14.359 --> 12:17.153
our journalistic efforts.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.531
'Well, I don't want to be

12:17.195 --> 12:19.531
the story at my own newspaper'

12:19.573 --> 12:21.115
because then

12:19.573 --> 12:21.115
I'd be Judith Miller.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.825
And I'd have to wear

12:21.157 --> 12:22.825
my bangs too long

12:22.867 --> 12:25.036
and over-do my lipstick,

12:22.867 --> 12:25.036
and I don't want that.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.913
I want to remain me.

12:26.954 --> 12:28.831
So I am tendering my resignation

12:28.873 --> 12:31.209
as editor in chief

12:28.873 --> 12:31.209
effective immediately.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.752
In closing, I'd like to state

12:31.251 --> 12:33.752
that the Yale Daily News

12:33.794 --> 12:36.590
has overcome numerous

12:33.794 --> 12:36.590
obstacles in its august history

12:36.631 --> 12:38.592
and that it will

12:36.631 --> 12:38.592
easily overcome this.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.968
'My resignation will be a loss,

12:38.633 --> 12:40.968
but it will be a loss'

12:41.010 --> 12:42.803
the Daily News can survive

12:42.845 --> 12:46.182
and it is a loss

12:42.845 --> 12:46.182
it must survive.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.851
Goodnight and good luck.

12:56.484 --> 12:59.153
[cheers and applause]

13:04.075 --> 13:05.452
[sighing]

13:05.493 --> 13:06.869
- I don't wanna go.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.869
- Of course, you don't.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.162
Your parents are

13:06.911 --> 13:08.162
not warm people.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.872
They were extras

13:08.204 --> 13:09.872
in "March Of The Penguins."

13:09.914 --> 13:10.998
Maybe we could skip the drinks.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.709
Just have the

13:11.040 --> 13:12.709
dinner and be done.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.335
Luke, you don't

13:12.751 --> 13:14.335
skip the one activity

13:14.377 --> 13:16.546
that makes the rest of the

13:14.377 --> 13:16.546
evening miraculously tolerable.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.715
The drinks fortify us.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.715
The drinks give us strength.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.592
- The drinks get us drunk.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.592
- Yeah, but they take forever.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.427
And then I got to sit there

13:20.634 --> 13:22.427
and talk to your dad

13:22.469 --> 13:24.845
about stocks and literature.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.307
And watch it dawn on him

13:24.887 --> 13:27.307
for the umpteenth time

13:27.348 --> 13:29.476
that I don't know anything

13:27.348 --> 13:29.476
about stocks or literature.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.018
I mean, how many

13:29.517 --> 13:31.018
times can two people

13:31.060 --> 13:32.853
have the same

13:31.060 --> 13:32.853
awful conversation?

13:32.895 --> 13:34.272
Look, just repeat after me

13:34.314 --> 13:36.149
"This is really great scotch,

13:34.314 --> 13:36.149
Richard."

13:36.190 --> 13:38.192
And then, of course, there's

13:36.190 --> 13:38.192
your mother, who hates me.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.944
All the more reason

13:38.234 --> 13:39.944
to get a little soused.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.571
- No, we can drink in the car.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.571
- One of us has to drive.

13:41.613 --> 13:42.697
Fine, you drink in

13:41.613 --> 13:42.697
the car, I'll take

13:42.739 --> 13:44.491
five quick shots

13:42.739 --> 13:44.491
in their driveway.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.618
Look, uh, I want to get out

13:44.532 --> 13:46.618
of there as quickly as you do

13:46.660 --> 13:48.620
but we have to think

13:46.660 --> 13:48.620
a little more pragmatically.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.538
So when the dessert comes,

13:48.662 --> 13:50.538
I will fake an attack

13:50.580 --> 13:52.873
of food poisoning,

13:50.580 --> 13:52.873
and then you rush me to the car.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.084
- That's your solution?

13:52.915 --> 13:55.084
- Uh-huh, yes.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.337
Fake stomach pain

13:55.126 --> 13:57.337
is my specialty.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.713
That and getting my fiance

13:58.755 --> 14:00.590
to agree to horrible

13:58.755 --> 14:00.590
things he hates.

14:00.632 --> 14:04.385
- Six-o'-clock?

14:00.632 --> 14:04.385
- Wear something fetching.

14:04.427 --> 14:05.886
What is Luke doing here?

14:05.928 --> 14:08.055
Oh, he's making a few

14:05.928 --> 14:08.055
minor repairs around the inn.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.890
- Hmm, what about the handyman?

14:08.097 --> 14:09.890
- Parker?

14:09.932 --> 14:11.309
Yes. I thought we liked him.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.102
Yeah, we do, but Luke

14:11.351 --> 14:13.102
offered and he has his

14:13.144 --> 14:15.146
own tool belt and

14:13.144 --> 14:15.146
the price was right.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.690
Oh, really? No charge?

14:16.731 --> 14:19.150
No, well, I did have

14:16.731 --> 14:19.150
to give him a coupon

14:19.192 --> 14:20.193
for a 100 free snuggles.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.653
How adorable.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.655
Yeah, and to tell the truth,

14:21.695 --> 14:23.655
Parker always kind of

14:23.697 --> 14:25.532
turned up his nose

14:23.697 --> 14:25.532
at my snuggle bucks.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.867
Hmm. So I guess this

14:25.573 --> 14:27.867
is how we're operating now.

14:27.908 --> 14:28.951
How's that?

14:28.993 --> 14:30.077
We've dispensed with hiring

14:30.119 --> 14:31.496
professionals around here.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.373
Maybe from now on,

14:31.538 --> 14:33.373
my cousin Gert

14:33.414 --> 14:34.541
can do our accounting.

14:34.582 --> 14:35.958
She's got her own calculator.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.627
He's not performing

14:36.000 --> 14:37.627
open-heart surgery, Michel.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.671
He's just fixing

14:37.669 --> 14:39.671
a few things, for free.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.840
Saving me a little money

14:39.713 --> 14:41.840
so I can do crazy things

14:41.881 --> 14:44.050
like pay people's salary

14:41.881 --> 14:44.050
and heat the place.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.719
Well, he's not doing

14:44.091 --> 14:45.719
a very good job.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.388
That key rack is protruding

14:45.760 --> 14:48.388
way too far out.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.223
It's going to wreak havoc

14:48.429 --> 14:50.223
on my French cuffs

14:50.264 --> 14:51.725
every time I reach for a key.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.226
Tell him how you like the hooks.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.561
Oh, I'm supposed to just

14:54.602 --> 14:56.145
follow him around

14:54.602 --> 14:56.145
all day correcting

14:56.187 --> 14:58.064
his every mistake? Absurd.

14:58.105 --> 15:00.107
We will sit down

14:58.105 --> 15:00.107
and make a detailed list

15:00.149 --> 15:02.443
of everything we need done,

15:00.149 --> 15:02.443
and he can consult that.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.195
- Luke does not need a list.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.195
- What do you mean?

15:04.237 --> 15:06.113
We always gave Parker a list.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.199
Luke's got a sixth sense

15:06.155 --> 15:08.199
about these things.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.950
He can spot a loose screw

15:08.241 --> 15:09.950
from across the room.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.870
He can sense when

15:09.992 --> 15:11.870
something needs to be fixed

15:11.911 --> 15:13.413
before it's even broken.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.413
It's spooky.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.456
Well, I will do a quick

15:13.454 --> 15:15.456
walk-through with him.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.709
Just to make sure his

15:15.498 --> 15:17.709
magical powers are working.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.085
Michel, there's

15:17.751 --> 15:19.085
no need for that.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.545
You've got plenty to

15:19.126 --> 15:20.545
handle with all the guests

15:20.587 --> 15:21.838
and Luke's got it covered.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.923
Left my sandpaper

15:21.880 --> 15:23.923
in the library.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.508
It must be nice to have a man

15:25.550 --> 15:28.720
who isn't ashamed of

15:25.550 --> 15:28.720
his own natural body odor.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.349
Come on.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.349
I'm trying to be accurate.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.685
There are no

15:33.391 --> 15:35.685
hanging chads, Bill.

15:35.727 --> 15:36.977
Give us the count.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.313
Okay, we've got

15:37.019 --> 15:39.313
16 votes for Casey

15:39.355 --> 15:42.233
18 for Andrew,

15:39.355 --> 15:42.233
and nine for Cathy.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.693
I can't do this anymore!

15:43.735 --> 15:44.985
We're never going

15:43.735 --> 15:44.985
to get a majority.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.112
Let's just not have an editor.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.405
We can run

15:46.153 --> 15:47.405
the paper by committee.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.031
No one said this

15:47.447 --> 15:49.031
was gonna be easy.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.742
It's been three days of voting.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.452
That's not an election,

15:50.784 --> 15:52.452
that's a sentence.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.745
Maybe we should take a break.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.121
No. No breaks.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.997
This isn't est.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.997
We get to leave.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.833
Well, then maybe we

15:57.039 --> 15:58.833
should send out for coffee.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.919
- Who wants coffee?

15:58.875 --> 16:00.919
- No way! I'm so wired.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.211
I'm jumping out of my skin!

16:02.253 --> 16:04.171
We have three candidates

16:02.253 --> 16:04.171
and no consensus.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.423
We're never

16:04.213 --> 16:05.423
getting out of here.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.133
- We need a new name.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.133
- I agree.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.927
- We're not getting anywhere.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.927
- How about Gilmore?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.095
- I like that name.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.847
Whoa, hey,

16:11.137 --> 16:12.847
I didn't mean my name.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.182
I'd vote for Rory before I'd

16:12.889 --> 16:15.182
switch to Andrew. Sorry, Andrew.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.936
And I'd vote for Rory before I'd

16:15.224 --> 16:17.936
switch to Cathy. Sorry, Cathy.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.479
And I'd vote for

16:17.977 --> 16:19.479
anybody over Casey

16:19.520 --> 16:21.397
because Casey's an idiot

16:19.520 --> 16:21.397
and he didn't even show up.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.232
- He's in the back.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.232
- Sorry, Casey.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.275
Got a statement, Gilmore?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.110
No, um..

16:26.152 --> 16:28.070
I'd just like to say,

16:26.152 --> 16:28.070
I'm flattered

16:28.112 --> 16:29.113
and you're very kind.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.240
Um, I did miss that semester

16:31.282 --> 16:32.700
so seniority's a question.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.661
We're past taking

16:32.742 --> 16:34.661
seniority into account.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.537
You totally bailed

16:34.702 --> 16:36.537
us out that night.

16:36.579 --> 16:37.956
The paper wouldn't have gone

16:36.579 --> 16:37.956
out if it weren't for you.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.039
- But--

16:37.997 --> 16:39.039
- 'What's your hesitation?'

16:39.081 --> 16:40.625
- Is it Paris?

16:39.081 --> 16:40.625
- No!

16:40.667 --> 16:42.126
I'm-I'm not hesitating

16:40.667 --> 16:42.126
because of Paris.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.586
Then why are you hesitating?

16:43.628 --> 16:45.964
I'm not.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.964
I accept the nomination.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.632
Please tell me

16:46.005 --> 16:47.632
we don't have to debate this.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.635
What's the debate? She's feeling

16:47.674 --> 16:50.635
pretty consensus-y to me.

16:50.677 --> 16:54.221
Alright, all those in favor of

16:50.677 --> 16:54.221
Rory Gilmore as editor, say aye.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.515
(in unison)

16:54.263 --> 16:55.515
Aye!

16:55.556 --> 16:58.559
Sounds consensus-y to me.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.559
Congratulations.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.855
Thank you, everyone.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.855
I won't let you down.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.857
This is part two

17:01.896 --> 17:03.857
of the financial-aid feature.

17:03.898 --> 17:05.525
We need your okay

17:03.898 --> 17:05.525
before going to layout.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.818
Good.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.818
I loved part one, by the way.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.736
- Thanks.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.736
- AP Pieces.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.112
We may need more

17:08.778 --> 17:10.112
filler than usual today.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.197
Good. Thanks, Sheila.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.532
These should

17:11.238 --> 17:12.532
probably come first.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.200
- Photo approvals?

17:12.573 --> 17:14.200
- Thanks, Joanie.

17:14.241 --> 17:16.536
Let Derek know that I'm gonna

17:14.241 --> 17:16.536
need some space in editorial.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.538
I wanna write a little

17:16.577 --> 17:18.538
note from me to the readers.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.331
Will do.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.960
[instrumental music]

17:28.589 --> 17:30.049
[gasps]

17:28.589 --> 17:30.049
Oh!

17:34.846 --> 17:36.138
Aw.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.356
[knocking]

17:43.437 --> 17:45.356
Paris!

17:45.398 --> 17:47.274
Doyle! Someone!

17:48.442 --> 17:50.028
You dare show your face?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.946
What is my stuff doing out here?

17:51.988 --> 17:54.240
I'll prorate the utilities

17:51.988 --> 17:54.240
from the time of eviction.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.617
3:47 p.m., the third

17:54.281 --> 17:56.617
day of February.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.995
Eviction?

17:56.659 --> 17:58.995
Paris, why are you doing this?

17:59.037 --> 18:01.288
- Don't you play dumb with me.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.288
- Unchain the door.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.332
This chain is here

18:01.330 --> 18:03.332
for your protection.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.334
Krav maga, baby,

18:03.374 --> 18:05.334
when my enemies approach

18:05.376 --> 18:06.961
I'm trained to pounce,

18:05.376 --> 18:06.961
it's reflex.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.796
- Paris, I'm not your enemy.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.796
- 'Oh, really?'

18:08.838 --> 18:10.214
Enemies move in silence

18:10.256 --> 18:11.883
and strike when

18:10.256 --> 18:11.883
their prey is weakest.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.176
Pretty much sums you up,

18:11.925 --> 18:14.176
doesn't it, Editor Gilmore?

18:14.218 --> 18:15.636
That was not my doing.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.636
That was the board's.

18:15.678 --> 18:18.014
- As if you didn't lobby for it.

18:15.678 --> 18:18.014
- I didn't!

18:18.056 --> 18:19.807
That secret meeting

18:18.056 --> 18:19.807
weeks ago at the pub

18:19.849 --> 18:21.434
where you set

18:19.849 --> 18:21.434
the putsch in motion.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.394
What happened, there wasn't

18:21.475 --> 18:23.394
a beer hall available?

18:23.436 --> 18:24.896
I did not set

18:23.436 --> 18:24.896
the putsch in motion.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.146
I can't even

18:24.938 --> 18:26.146
spell "putsch."

18:26.188 --> 18:28.066
Nice spin.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.066
Take it to K-street.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.150
'I made you my number two,

18:28.107 --> 18:30.150
and it went to your head!'

18:30.192 --> 18:31.945
You can't just

18:30.192 --> 18:31.945
kick me out like this!

18:31.986 --> 18:34.072
'There's a hallway full

18:31.986 --> 18:34.072
of crap that says otherwise!'

18:34.113 --> 18:36.449
- But we're friends.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.449
- We're not friends.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.158
I understand why you're upset

18:38.200 --> 18:39.953
but just let me in

18:38.200 --> 18:39.953
so I can explain.

18:39.994 --> 18:42.830
"Gee, Paris, what a horrible

18:39.994 --> 18:42.830
job being editor is.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.041
"Who needs the headache?

18:42.872 --> 18:45.041
Remember Chilton, Paris?

18:45.083 --> 18:46.500
"All those good times."

18:46.542 --> 18:48.002
Well, the good times are over!

18:48.044 --> 18:49.169
[door bangs]

18:50.588 --> 18:52.381
Here, this is yours too.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.598
Luke, can we talk for a minute?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.558
- Yeah, what's up?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.558
- I noticed your truck,

19:02.600 --> 19:05.019
- Yeah.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.019
- Your filthy green truck.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.187
- It's parked in guest parking.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.187
- So?

19:07.229 --> 19:09.690
So, guest parking

19:07.229 --> 19:09.690
is for guests.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.943
Filthy-green-truck

19:09.732 --> 19:11.943
parking is around the back

19:11.985 --> 19:13.402
on the dirt road,

19:11.985 --> 19:13.402
behind the shed.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.822
- I'll be done in two minutes.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.822
- Wonderful.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.991
- Now, about your hat.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.991
- My hat?

19:18.032 --> 19:19.575
I'd like you to remove it.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.201
- What for?

19:19.617 --> 19:21.201
- You're indoors.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.829
Gentlemen don't

19:21.243 --> 19:22.829
wear hats indoors.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.622
It's okay.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.622
I'm not much of a gentleman.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.458
Not if you persist in dressing

19:24.664 --> 19:27.458
like a "Peanuts" character.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.127
I'm not taking off my hat.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.671
Did you talk to

19:29.168 --> 19:31.671
a guest this morning?

19:31.712 --> 19:33.380
I thought I saw you

19:31.712 --> 19:33.380
talking to a guest.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.424
I may have given

19:33.422 --> 19:35.424
someone directions.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.217
Well, don't do it again.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.217
You're not qualified.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.427
I'm not qualified

19:37.259 --> 19:38.427
to tell somebody

19:38.469 --> 19:39.679
how to get

19:38.469 --> 19:39.679
to the post office?

19:39.720 --> 19:42.348
No. You are a diner owner.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.475
And an amateur

19:42.389 --> 19:44.475
substitute handyman

19:44.517 --> 19:45.893
and that in no way

19:44.517 --> 19:45.893
qualifies you

19:45.935 --> 19:47.520
to give directions

19:45.935 --> 19:47.520
to our guests.

19:47.561 --> 19:50.023
- Why not?

19:47.561 --> 19:50.023
- Because that is my job!

19:50.064 --> 19:51.983
And you lack my people skills.

19:52.025 --> 19:55.153
- Go away, Michel.

19:52.025 --> 19:55.153
- Keep your voice down.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.571
- The guests can hear.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.571
- There isn't anyone down here.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.615
Yeah, but they're all upstairs,

19:57.613 --> 19:59.615
and your voice carries!

19:59.657 --> 20:01.159
Hey, you're the one

19:59.657 --> 20:01.159
doing the yelling.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.036
I'm yelling because

20:01.200 --> 20:03.036
you are flouting the rules

20:03.077 --> 20:05.287
of this establishment,

20:03.077 --> 20:05.287
parking where you want

20:05.329 --> 20:07.373
talking when you want,

20:05.329 --> 20:07.373
wearing what you want.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.667
And 20 minutes ago,

20:07.414 --> 20:09.667
I saw you eating a sandwich.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.293
So what?

20:11.335 --> 20:13.212
We don't let the help

20:11.335 --> 20:13.212
eat in front of the guests!

20:13.253 --> 20:16.049
The next time you eat,

20:13.253 --> 20:16.049
you do so in the kitchen.

20:16.090 --> 20:17.884
- Or the barn!

20:16.090 --> 20:17.884
- I'm not gonna eat in the barn!

20:17.925 --> 20:19.760
Parker ate in the barn.

20:19.802 --> 20:23.139
- Who's Parker?

20:19.802 --> 20:23.139
- A...wonderful, wonderful man.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.684
[pop music]

20:26.726 --> 20:29.187
[sighing]

20:29.228 --> 20:30.897
- 'Hello?'

20:29.228 --> 20:30.897
- There are no singles left.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.314
What do you mean "no singles"?

20:32.356 --> 20:33.566
I just talked to campus housing

20:33.607 --> 20:35.193
and there are no

20:33.607 --> 20:35.193
singles left at Branford

20:35.234 --> 20:36.861
or anywhere on campus.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.238
And the decent off-campus

20:36.903 --> 20:39.238
apartments are long gone.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.656
The ones left make Paris

20:40.698 --> 20:42.324
and Doyle's place

20:40.698 --> 20:42.324
look like Versailles.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.451
What are you talking about?

20:42.366 --> 20:44.451
Why do you need a place?

20:44.493 --> 20:46.787
I got elected editor

20:44.493 --> 20:46.787
of the<i> Daily News.</i>

20:46.829 --> 20:50.124
- What? You did?

20:46.829 --> 20:50.124
- 'Yes.'

20:50.166 --> 20:52.126
Wow! Finally someone good

20:50.166 --> 20:52.126
running that place!

20:52.168 --> 20:53.460
Someone great!

20:52.168 --> 20:53.460
You're gonna be great!

20:53.502 --> 20:55.588
Well, hot-plate Harriet

20:53.502 --> 20:55.588
took it very badly.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.090
- Who's that?

20:55.629 --> 20:57.090
- Paris.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.050
She threw all my stuff

20:57.131 --> 20:59.050
out into the hallway.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.052
So, I'm sitting here

20:59.092 --> 21:01.052
guarding it all

21:01.094 --> 21:02.344
until the movers get here.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.304
Oh, man! Paris, idiot.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.183
My books look sad.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.183
Can books look sad?

21:07.225 --> 21:09.351
Look, we'll figure this out.

21:07.225 --> 21:09.351
Now, you said you got movers?

21:09.393 --> 21:10.644
Starving students.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.188
How starving can they be

21:10.686 --> 21:12.188
if they can't come

21:12.230 --> 21:13.898
for five hours after you call?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.942
Plus, I heard the guy crunching

21:13.940 --> 21:15.942
on something during our call.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.276
Sounded like baked Lay's.

21:17.317 --> 21:18.527
And you've got nowhere

21:17.317 --> 21:18.527
to go, right?

21:18.569 --> 21:19.695
Right-a-mundo.

21:19.737 --> 21:23.116
Well...you can move in with me.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.784
- What?

21:23.157 --> 21:24.784
- Move in with me.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.119
Paris' place is a hole anyway.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.745
I never liked

21:26.160 --> 21:27.745
that you lived there.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.455
And that doo-wop group

21:27.787 --> 21:29.455
downstairs, I don't think

21:29.496 --> 21:30.706
they're an honest-to-goodness

21:29.496 --> 21:30.706
singing group.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.541
Logan, that's really sweet.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.043
But I can't move in with you.

21:34.085 --> 21:35.962
Why not? You're here

21:34.085 --> 21:35.962
half the time anyway.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.713
You've already got two dresser

21:36.003 --> 21:37.713
drawers you call your own.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.465
And right now, for a limited

21:37.755 --> 21:39.465
time, I'll throw in three

21:39.506 --> 21:40.967
more drawers and

21:39.506 --> 21:40.967
a set of ginsu knives.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.384
- Really?

21:41.008 --> 21:42.384
- No!

21:42.426 --> 21:43.970
I have no idea where

21:42.426 --> 21:43.970
to get ginsu knives.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.679
It's kind of a big step,

21:44.011 --> 21:45.679
isn't it?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.223
You need a place,

21:45.721 --> 21:47.223
I got the space.

21:47.265 --> 21:48.474
It'll be fun.

21:47.265 --> 21:48.474
Don't you think, it'll be fun?

21:48.515 --> 21:49.976
- Fun?

21:48.515 --> 21:49.976
- Come on, Ace.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.936
You know what I mean.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.936
What do you say?

21:51.978 --> 21:53.687
Well..

21:53.729 --> 21:55.439
...I might need

21:53.729 --> 21:55.439
just one more drawer.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.483
I can put my socks in

21:55.481 --> 21:57.483
a shoe box under the bed.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.401
- Is that a yes?

21:57.524 --> 21:59.401
- I guess that's a yes.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.987
Good.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.987
I'm calling Colin and Finn.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.155
They'll be right over

22:01.028 --> 22:02.155
to get your stuff.

22:02.196 --> 22:03.739
- Okay.

22:02.196 --> 22:03.739
- And no shoe boxes.

22:03.781 --> 22:04.865
You're getting

22:03.781 --> 22:04.865
those drawers.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.951
I'll take them.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.951
Wait, wait!

22:06.993 --> 22:08.744
Hold on, I've got to take this.

22:08.786 --> 22:11.789
Okay, get past the hamper,

22:08.786 --> 22:11.789
veer left at the mirror.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.373
Grab the large pipe on the wall

22:11.831 --> 22:13.373
to get yourself

22:13.415 --> 22:14.792
to the desk which

22:13.415 --> 22:14.792
you can then go

22:14.834 --> 22:16.127
over or under.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.127
I'll guide you from there.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.421
[sighs]

22:17.544 --> 22:19.421
Got a little

22:17.544 --> 22:19.421
snack there, Michel?

22:19.463 --> 22:22.675
These are not a snack. They are

22:19.463 --> 22:22.675
my 12 daily omega-3 walnuts.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.135
But, I hate to see you

22:22.716 --> 22:24.135
bingeing like this.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.928
And now I've lost count.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.139
Let's talk about your

22:25.970 --> 22:28.139
little spat with Luke today.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.265
What did he tell you?

22:29.307 --> 22:30.599
He said you yelled at him.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.852
[scoffs]

22:30.641 --> 22:32.852
Oh! What a crybaby.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.061
He's not a crybaby.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.395
He just doesn't like

22:34.103 --> 22:35.395
being screamed at

22:35.437 --> 22:37.148
by people he's doing favors for.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.192
Did you check his diaper

22:37.190 --> 22:39.192
or maybe he's just upset

22:39.233 --> 22:40.734
because you forgot

22:39.233 --> 22:40.734
to change him today.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.111
Now who's a crybaby?

22:42.153 --> 22:44.071
I used to yell at

22:42.153 --> 22:44.071
Parker all the time

22:44.113 --> 22:45.906
and he never once

22:44.113 --> 22:45.906
came running to you.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.574
What is this thing

22:45.948 --> 22:47.574
with you and Parker?

22:47.616 --> 22:50.368
- Did he save your life in Nam?

22:47.616 --> 22:50.368
- Parker is a professional.

22:50.410 --> 22:53.371
Parker is a clumsy,

22:50.410 --> 22:53.371
forgetful, 65-year-old

22:53.413 --> 22:55.208
semi-lucid, not-that-handy,

22:53.413 --> 22:55.208
handyman.

22:55.249 --> 22:57.543
- Luke wears a hat indoors.

22:55.249 --> 22:57.543
- So did Parker.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.671
That was a wool-knit cap.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.671
It's completely different.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.048
So this is a hat thing?

23:02.089 --> 23:03.924
I just don't like Luke's system.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.635
He misses many things that

23:03.966 --> 23:06.635
needs to be fixed, many things.

23:06.677 --> 23:07.928
Well, so jot them down.

23:07.970 --> 23:09.555
That's not how we make the list.

23:09.596 --> 23:11.057
- So type them up.

23:09.596 --> 23:11.057
- No!

23:11.098 --> 23:12.850
We make the list

23:11.098 --> 23:12.850
at Weston's over coffee.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.601
That's what we do

23:12.892 --> 23:14.601
when we make the list.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.603
We go once a month

23:14.643 --> 23:16.603
to Weston's together

23:16.645 --> 23:19.023
and we sit, and we decide

23:16.645 --> 23:19.023
on the work for the handyman.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.566
'That's our thing.'

23:20.607 --> 23:22.860
We get very large coffees

23:20.607 --> 23:22.860
and we split a slice

23:22.902 --> 23:24.945
of red-velvet cake and we gossip

23:24.987 --> 23:26.864
and I eat the whole cake

23:24.987 --> 23:26.864
and you never tell anyone.

23:26.906 --> 23:29.700
Oh, Michel, I liked

23:26.906 --> 23:29.700
our trips to Weston's.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.702
Oh, yes, that is what

23:29.742 --> 23:31.702
I do when I like something.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.371
I cut it out of

23:31.744 --> 23:33.371
my life completely.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.539
I didn't cut coffee

23:33.411 --> 23:35.539
with you out of my life.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.624
Oh, then you just forgot?

23:37.666 --> 23:39.668
How special those times

23:37.666 --> 23:39.668
must have been for you.

23:39.710 --> 23:42.546
They were special. It's just

23:39.710 --> 23:42.546
been crazy around here.

23:42.588 --> 23:45.216
Well, it was nice to save

23:42.588 --> 23:45.216
a little money with Luke.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.093
Money isn't everything,

23:45.258 --> 23:47.093
you know.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.262
People come to work for

23:47.134 --> 23:49.262
more than just the money.

23:49.303 --> 23:51.389
Although my direct

23:49.303 --> 23:51.389
deposit was late again.

23:51.429 --> 23:52.598
Maybe that's something

23:51.429 --> 23:52.598
you can finally get

23:52.639 --> 23:53.682
around to looking into.

23:53.724 --> 23:55.433
I will.

23:55.475 --> 23:57.270
I guess you don't have

23:55.475 --> 23:57.270
to write that down, either?

23:57.311 --> 23:59.313
No one needs a list anymore?

23:59.355 --> 24:00.773
These are candied.

24:00.814 --> 24:03.192
Well...the real ones

24:00.814 --> 24:03.192
taste like cardboard

24:03.234 --> 24:04.484
and the health

24:03.234 --> 24:04.484
benefits are the same

24:04.526 --> 24:05.611
except for the skin.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.196
What are you doing

24:05.652 --> 24:07.196
this afternoon?

24:07.238 --> 24:08.739
I'm going to yell at Doreen

24:07.238 --> 24:08.739
about the soap spots

24:08.781 --> 24:10.574
on room 3's bathroom

24:08.781 --> 24:10.574
floor tiles.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.368
Well, instead, how

24:10.616 --> 24:12.368
about if you and I take

24:12.410 --> 24:13.953
a trip to Weston's?

24:13.994 --> 24:16.163
We can make Luke a list

24:13.994 --> 24:16.163
over cake and coffee

24:16.205 --> 24:19.250
and we can throw around ideas

24:16.205 --> 24:19.250
about improvements at the inn.

24:19.292 --> 24:20.960
I do not need your pity cake.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.502
It's not pity cake.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.502
It's red-velvet cake.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.380
And it's delicious.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.380
And I think we ought to eat it.

24:24.422 --> 24:25.547
Although this time,

24:24.422 --> 24:25.547
you're getting your own.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.174
Because I am not sharing.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.260
Well, I guess I could

24:27.216 --> 24:29.260
yell at Doreen tomorrow.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.553
Tomorrow seems like a fine

24:29.302 --> 24:31.553
day to yell at Doreen.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.306
- So, Weston's?

24:31.595 --> 24:33.306
- Weston's.

24:33.347 --> 24:35.975
I was thinking maybe you

24:33.347 --> 24:35.975
could have Luke wear a jumpsuit

24:36.016 --> 24:37.851
when he's working around

24:36.016 --> 24:37.851
the inn, you know, the kind

24:37.893 --> 24:39.645
gas-station attendants wear.

24:39.686 --> 24:41.688
Yeah, why don't we

24:39.686 --> 24:41.688
put a pin in that one?

24:41.730 --> 24:44.817
So far, I have seen no

24:41.730 --> 24:44.817
one here smarter than you.

24:44.858 --> 24:45.901
You can tell that?

24:45.943 --> 24:47.236
And I'm keeping track.

24:47.278 --> 24:51.324
566 people, all inferior to you.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.992
- I don't believe it.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.992
- What?

24:53.033 --> 24:54.368
Did you not see those two girls?

24:54.410 --> 24:56.954
- No, what?

24:54.410 --> 24:56.954
- They totally checked you out.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.998
They did? Cool.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.498
It's the same way with mom.

25:00.540 --> 25:03.043
I swear, I hate

25:00.540 --> 25:03.043
having hot parents.

25:03.085 --> 25:05.463
- Sorry.

25:03.085 --> 25:05.463
- Check it out.

25:05.503 --> 25:09.216
I had him for

25:05.503 --> 25:09.216
microeconomics last year.

25:09.258 --> 25:12.345
The currency must be more

25:09.258 --> 25:12.345
than fungible, but also scarce.

25:12.386 --> 25:13.553
Take our seashells example.

25:13.595 --> 25:14.930
While fungible..

25:14.972 --> 25:16.390
...they exist in infinite supply

25:16.432 --> 25:18.184
and so fail the scarcity test.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.436
[snoring]

25:20.478 --> 25:23.147
- Dad!

25:20.478 --> 25:23.147
- Huh? What? Uh, uh, fungible?

25:23.189 --> 25:25.649
Dad, that's

25:23.189 --> 25:25.649
a Nobel-prize winner.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.318
- The dull dude?

25:25.691 --> 25:27.318
- Shh!

25:27.360 --> 25:29.236
He doesn't even own an iron.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.279
I can't take you anywhere.

25:30.321 --> 25:32.490
No, you can't, can you?

25:32.530 --> 25:34.658
[guitar music]

25:36.285 --> 25:38.162
- This where we're eating?

25:36.285 --> 25:38.162
- We don't have to.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.579
I just wanted you to see it.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.040
Well, I'll eat

25:39.621 --> 25:41.040
wherever you want to eat.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.916
Okay, I know a cool spot.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.503
And we've pretty much covered

25:42.958 --> 25:45.503
every square inch of campus.

25:45.543 --> 25:47.880
- So, let's go.

25:45.543 --> 25:47.880
- Hey, what about your place?

25:47.921 --> 25:49.840
- My place?

25:47.921 --> 25:49.840
- Yeah, I want to see it.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.343
- Why?

25:49.882 --> 25:52.343
- Because I'm curious.

25:52.385 --> 25:54.303
I wanna see

25:52.385 --> 25:54.303
where my kid lives.

25:54.345 --> 25:56.430
Well, it's pretty messy

25:54.345 --> 25:56.430
right now.

25:56.472 --> 25:59.016
The lady who cleans my house

25:56.472 --> 25:59.016
has to use a bulldozer.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.767
Messy does not frighten me.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.895
Okay, but you've been warned.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.980
[chuckles]

26:02.936 --> 26:04.980
Lead the way.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.025
[elevator dings]

26:08.067 --> 26:10.403
Man, did you see that lobby?

26:10.444 --> 26:11.945
Um, yeah. Once or twice.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.114
That was a lobby and a doorman?

26:14.156 --> 26:15.533
I'm slipping that guy

26:14.156 --> 26:15.533
a little something

26:15.573 --> 26:17.117
extra to keep

26:15.573 --> 26:17.117
an eye on you, by the way.

26:17.159 --> 26:18.911
- You don't have to do that.

26:17.159 --> 26:18.911
- Are you kidding?

26:18.952 --> 26:22.081
I love slipping people

26:18.952 --> 26:22.081
money to do things.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.916
- We're here?

26:22.122 --> 26:23.916
- Yep.

26:23.957 --> 26:27.086
You got a key or is it

26:23.957 --> 26:27.086
scanning your retina for access?

26:27.127 --> 26:30.672
[sighs]

26:27.127 --> 26:30.672
Dad, I have to be straight

26:27.127 --> 26:30.672
with you about something.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.509
- Oops.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.509
- No, it's just..

26:33.551 --> 26:36.470
Today...was a weird day.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.389
It started really great

26:36.512 --> 26:38.389
with me getting voted

26:38.431 --> 26:39.890
editor-in-chief of

26:38.431 --> 26:39.890
my school paper.

26:39.932 --> 26:43.102
What? You did?

26:39.932 --> 26:43.102
Oh, boy, Rory, that's amazing.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.729
Thank you, it is.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.729
It's just, Paris.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.357
My roommate Paris,

26:45.771 --> 26:48.357
she was the editor.

26:48.399 --> 26:51.777
Um, but when she found out

26:48.399 --> 26:51.777
that I was made the new editor

26:51.818 --> 26:53.070
she threw me out.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.406
What? You want me

26:53.112 --> 26:55.406
to talk to her?

26:55.448 --> 26:57.116
No, it's fine, it's just..

26:57.157 --> 26:59.326
... that I had no place to go.

26:59.368 --> 27:02.704
So, I moved in

26:59.368 --> 27:02.704
with my boyfriend.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.622
- Oh.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.622
- In there.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.542
- Your boyfriend.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.542
- You actually met him once.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.502
- I did?

27:06.584 --> 27:08.502
- At grandma's vow renewal.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.254
- He was the guy--

27:08.544 --> 27:10.254
- Right.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.672
- Yes.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.672
- When I walked in and you two--

27:12.714 --> 27:15.426
- Exactly.

27:12.714 --> 27:15.426
- Okay, well, uh..

27:15.468 --> 27:18.387
Why don't we open the door

27:15.468 --> 27:18.387
so I can...see what my daughter

27:18.429 --> 27:20.598
living with her

27:18.429 --> 27:20.598
boyfriend looks like?

27:20.638 --> 27:23.559
Okay.

27:23.601 --> 27:25.144
[door creaks]

27:35.613 --> 27:37.323
- Hey.

27:35.613 --> 27:37.323
- Hi.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.949
I tried to call you to let

27:37.364 --> 27:38.949
you know we were coming over.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.034
- But you didn't answer.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.034
- Right. Headphones.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.453
- They work.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.453
- Sure do.

27:42.495 --> 27:45.080
So, uh, Logan, this is

27:42.495 --> 27:45.080
my father, Christopher.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.124
- Hi, good to meet you.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.124
- Actually, we've met.

27:47.166 --> 27:50.085
- I know.

27:47.166 --> 27:50.085
- Don't worry about it.

27:50.127 --> 27:52.379
Wow, this is,

27:50.127 --> 27:52.379
uh, some spread.

27:52.421 --> 27:55.424
Aw, thanks.

27:52.421 --> 27:55.424
You brought your dad here.

27:55.466 --> 27:57.510
He wanted to see where I lived.

27:55.466 --> 27:57.510
What was I supposed to do?

27:57.551 --> 27:58.927
Yeah, but I need

27:57.551 --> 27:58.927
a little bit of a warning.

27:58.969 --> 28:00.471
I tried to call you.

28:00.513 --> 28:02.473
Should I put the headphones on?

28:00.513 --> 28:02.473
'Cause I'm right here.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.391
- No. Sorry.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.391
- Yeah, sorry.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.519
Look, I didn't mean to

28:04.433 --> 28:06.519
barge in on you like this.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.395
I just want to make sure

28:06.560 --> 28:08.395
my kid's got a decent place

28:08.437 --> 28:10.356
to live, that's all.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.815
Hey, so, how do

28:10.397 --> 28:11.815
you like the plasma?

28:11.857 --> 28:12.858
Love it.

28:12.899 --> 28:13.900
Yeah, I'm thinking about getting

28:13.942 --> 28:15.444
a 60-inch for the bedroom.

28:15.486 --> 28:16.736
Well, I've got

28:15.486 --> 28:16.736
a great home-theater

28:16.778 --> 28:17.779
guy if you need some help.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.031
Yeah, I may take you up on that.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.366
You want something

28:19.072 --> 28:20.366
to drink, dad?

28:20.407 --> 28:22.075
Sure, I'll take a soda,

28:20.407 --> 28:22.075
if you got one.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.619
Coming right up.

28:25.663 --> 28:27.665
Wow! That's a great view.

28:27.705 --> 28:29.208
Yeah, that's the

28:27.705 --> 28:29.208
old campus over there.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.960
Oh, me and the old

28:29.249 --> 28:31.960
campus go way back.

28:32.002 --> 28:33.837
Is that...it is.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.422
That's Endicott Peabody.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.715
[chuckles]

28:35.464 --> 28:37.715
Why do you have that?

28:37.757 --> 28:39.926
- Are you a Groton man?

28:37.757 --> 28:39.926
- Was, briefly.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.803
I actually swiped that

28:39.968 --> 28:41.803
from the headmaster's

28:41.845 --> 28:43.389
office on my way out the door.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.265
- I was kicked out of Groton.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.265
- You're kidding.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.685
Nope, did a semester

28:45.307 --> 28:47.685
at St. Sebastian's after that.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.853
I know several people who got

28:47.726 --> 28:49.853
kicked out of St. Sebastian's.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.397
My good friend Colin

28:49.895 --> 28:51.397
was actually banned

28:51.438 --> 28:53.524
from coming anywhere

28:51.438 --> 28:53.524
within a ten-mile radius.

28:53.566 --> 28:54.774
- Impressive.

28:53.566 --> 28:54.774
- Here you go.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.360
Thank you.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.904
After St. Sebastian's,

28:56.402 --> 28:58.904
I went on to St. Cybil's.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.072
I almost went there myself

29:00.113 --> 29:01.657
but I wound up

29:00.113 --> 29:01.657
at St. Mark's instead.

29:01.699 --> 29:03.659
- How long you last there?

29:01.699 --> 29:03.659
- About a week.

29:03.701 --> 29:05.327
Yeah, they got quite the

29:03.701 --> 29:05.327
trigger finger at St. Mark's.

29:05.369 --> 29:07.037
- You ever do Deerfield?

29:05.369 --> 29:07.037
- Please!

29:07.079 --> 29:08.955
Deerfield's for amateurs.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.955
I got kicked out of Rivers.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.624
I didn't think Rivers

29:08.997 --> 29:10.624
kicked anybody out.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.251
Neither did we,

29:10.666 --> 29:12.251
but Dean Eldon's

29:12.292 --> 29:14.169
'Miata, in the bottom

29:12.292 --> 29:14.169
of Lake Rutherford'

29:14.211 --> 29:15.212
'proved just the ticket.'

29:15.254 --> 29:16.547
Rory, you got a good man here.

29:16.589 --> 29:18.424
Interesting yardstick

29:16.589 --> 29:18.424
you're using.

29:18.465 --> 29:21.385
Hey, uh, listen, Logan, we were

29:18.465 --> 29:21.385
just about to grab some dinner.

29:21.427 --> 29:24.096
- You want to come with?

29:21.427 --> 29:24.096
- Oh, I don't wanna intrude.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.847
No, come. That would be great.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.433
Okay, sure.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.433
Just let me grab my wallet.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.184
I'll be right with you.

29:29.226 --> 29:31.604
- You're being nice to him.

29:29.226 --> 29:31.604
- He's a cool guy.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.189
Listen, I haven't had a chance

29:31.645 --> 29:34.189
to tell mom about this yet.

29:34.231 --> 29:35.608
It's not a big deal.

29:35.649 --> 29:37.401
- It just happened so fast.

29:35.649 --> 29:37.401
- I get it.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.236
I'm gonna tell her about it

29:37.443 --> 29:39.236
today, so just..

29:39.278 --> 29:41.113
You tell her.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.113
I'm going TV shopping.

29:41.154 --> 29:44.032
- Okay.

29:41.154 --> 29:44.032
- Okay, rich man's shoe.

29:44.074 --> 29:45.492
- Where else?

29:44.074 --> 29:45.492
- Rich man's shoe?

29:45.534 --> 29:46.952
Best burgers

29:45.534 --> 29:46.952
within walking distance.

29:46.993 --> 29:49.329
We have very high

29:46.993 --> 29:49.329
culinary standards here at Yale.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.540
Whoa, is that

29:49.371 --> 29:51.540
the new X-box 360?

29:51.582 --> 29:53.667
Okay, I'm totally

29:51.582 --> 29:53.667
moving in here with you.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.129
Are you serious?

29:57.170 --> 29:58.380
(Lorelai)

29:57.170 --> 29:58.380
'Just look at it

29:57.170 --> 29:58.380
as a challenge.'

29:58.422 --> 30:00.048
There's 85 things

29:58.422 --> 30:00.048
on this list.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.717
Actually, that last page

30:00.090 --> 30:01.717
we did front and back.

30:01.759 --> 30:03.009
- Wow.

30:01.759 --> 30:03.009
- Yeah.

30:03.051 --> 30:04.303
I thought we'd make it

30:03.051 --> 30:04.303
an even 100.

30:04.344 --> 30:06.138
"Regrout the tiles

30:04.344 --> 30:06.138
behind the sink basin."

30:06.179 --> 30:08.641
- Long overdue.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.641
- How can you tell?

30:08.682 --> 30:11.310
Well, if you slide

30:08.682 --> 30:11.310
on your back under the sink

30:11.351 --> 30:13.186
and shine a flashlight

30:11.351 --> 30:13.186
up into the area

30:13.228 --> 30:14.772
where the basin meets the wall,

30:13.228 --> 30:14.772
it's really obvious.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.774
Sure. What does ODD mean?

30:16.856 --> 30:18.442
"Only During the Day."

30:18.484 --> 30:20.068
'Those are tasks we deemed

30:18.484 --> 30:20.068
too noisy for you to do'

30:20.110 --> 30:21.111
'when guests are sleeping.'

30:21.153 --> 30:22.696
How considerate.

30:22.738 --> 30:25.282
"Replace chocolate-brown

30:22.738 --> 30:25.282
contact paper in kitchen drawers

30:25.324 --> 30:26.908
with cocoa brown."

30:26.950 --> 30:28.368
Okay, that one I blame

30:26.950 --> 30:28.368
on the second piece of cake.

30:28.410 --> 30:29.495
There was a major

30:28.410 --> 30:29.495
sugar rush involved.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.079
I hate this list.

30:31.121 --> 30:33.039
I know, but Michel and

30:31.121 --> 30:33.039
I made that list together

30:33.081 --> 30:34.667
and we bonded,

30:33.081 --> 30:34.667
and that makes him happy.

30:34.708 --> 30:35.917
I don't wanna

30:34.708 --> 30:35.917
make him happy.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.295
If Michel's happy,

30:35.959 --> 30:38.295
then I'm happy.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.921
And then I take

30:38.337 --> 30:39.921
all that happiness

30:39.963 --> 30:43.049
and I give it right back

30:39.963 --> 30:43.049
to you, tonight, in bed

30:43.091 --> 30:44.593
after you spend four hours

30:43.091 --> 30:44.593
with my parents.

30:44.635 --> 30:47.137
- What do you say?

30:44.635 --> 30:47.137
- Can't Parker do the list?

30:47.179 --> 30:48.347
No.

30:54.311 --> 30:56.355
Luke, you eat so little.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.649
My motto is

30:56.396 --> 30:58.649
"Everything in moderation."

30:58.691 --> 31:00.734
Smart.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.734
Very Walden-esque.

31:00.776 --> 31:02.361
But it's good, though.

31:00.776 --> 31:02.361
Everything's really good.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.737
The duck<i> pate</i> especially.

31:03.779 --> 31:05.823
Thank you.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.949
- Number three? The Martini?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.949
- Hmm?

31:07.991 --> 31:09.743
- It helps settle my stomach.

31:07.991 --> 31:09.743
- Gin?

31:09.785 --> 31:12.412
Absolutely. Helps counteract

31:09.785 --> 31:12.412
the oh-so-regrettable shrimp

31:12.454 --> 31:13.622
I had for lunch today.

31:13.664 --> 31:14.914
Yeah,

31:13.664 --> 31:14.914
you mentioned that before.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.583
The shrimp did not agree

31:14.956 --> 31:16.583
with you.

31:16.625 --> 31:19.252
Might have to turn in early.

31:16.625 --> 31:19.252
Damn, that Al!

31:19.294 --> 31:20.379
- Al?

31:19.294 --> 31:20.379
- Al's Pancake World.

31:20.420 --> 31:21.505
Where I had the shrimp.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.048
You ate shrimp

31:21.547 --> 31:23.048
at a pancake house?

31:23.089 --> 31:24.508
Well, of course

31:23.089 --> 31:24.508
your stomach's unsettled.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.967
You should drink club soda.

31:26.009 --> 31:27.636
No, I think we have

31:26.009 --> 31:27.636
some at the house.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.262
Yeah, might have to cut

31:27.678 --> 31:29.262
the night a little short.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.056
So you're living

31:29.304 --> 31:31.056
at Lorelai's house, Luke?

31:31.097 --> 31:32.599
- Mother!

31:31.097 --> 31:32.599
- Is that so private?

31:32.641 --> 31:35.644
No, we're in the process

31:32.641 --> 31:35.644
of consolidating things.

31:35.686 --> 31:37.354
- Consolidating your assets?

31:35.686 --> 31:37.354
- Right.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.731
Tricky business.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.524
Is that house big enough

31:38.772 --> 31:40.524
for the two of you?

31:40.566 --> 31:42.526
I've remodeled a little,

31:40.566 --> 31:42.526
added some space.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.611
- Smart.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.611
- Yeah, well. We're smart today.

31:44.653 --> 31:45.738
Except when you ate that shrimp.

31:45.779 --> 31:47.197
Yeah, that was dumb.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.074
You've updated

31:47.239 --> 31:49.074
your coverage, I assume?

31:49.115 --> 31:50.950
Let your insurance company

31:49.115 --> 31:50.950
know about the improvements?

31:50.992 --> 31:52.244
You're my

31:50.992 --> 31:52.244
insurance company, dad.

31:52.285 --> 31:53.286
For the inn, not your house.

31:53.328 --> 31:54.663
I haven't yet, but I will.

31:54.705 --> 31:56.331
- You should do it soon.

31:54.705 --> 31:56.331
- I'll do it tomorrow.

31:56.373 --> 31:58.834
- If you're feeling okay.

31:56.373 --> 31:58.834
- 'Better not wait.'

31:58.876 --> 32:00.419
Small gaps

31:58.876 --> 32:00.419
in your insurance coverage

32:00.460 --> 32:02.003
can lead to big mistakes.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.881
Oh, I could tell you

32:02.045 --> 32:03.881
horror stories.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.758
- Brian Hunter.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.758
- 'Yes.'

32:05.799 --> 32:08.761
He owned a home for 40 years.

32:05.799 --> 32:08.761
Huge mansion.

32:08.802 --> 32:10.554
Never updated his coverage.

32:10.596 --> 32:13.973
'One night, his trophy bimbo

32:10.596 --> 32:13.973
wife got into a drunken snit'

32:14.015 --> 32:16.518
lit a curtain on fire

32:14.015 --> 32:16.518
with her marijuana cigarette

32:16.560 --> 32:18.019
and burned the place

32:16.560 --> 32:18.019
to the ground.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.563
He couldn't afford to rebuild.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.690
Lost his fortune,

32:19.605 --> 32:21.690
lost the bimbo.

32:21.732 --> 32:23.567
Now he sells sunglasses

32:21.732 --> 32:23.567
out of the back of a van

32:23.609 --> 32:25.360
in California. Cheap ones.

32:25.402 --> 32:27.654
Because he didn't update

32:25.402 --> 32:27.654
his coverage.

32:27.696 --> 32:29.448
- What about your diner?

32:27.696 --> 32:29.448
- What about it, dad?

32:29.489 --> 32:32.033
I'm just wondering if Luke's

32:29.489 --> 32:32.033
insurance is up to date.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.411
I'm sorry, did you invite us

32:32.075 --> 32:34.411
over to sell us insurance?

32:34.453 --> 32:36.329
Because if you did,

32:34.453 --> 32:36.329
I'm going to insist

32:36.371 --> 32:38.498
on seeing the complimentary

32:36.371 --> 32:38.498
desk calendar first.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.166
I'm simply inquiring.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.628
I think I'm all up to date.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.797
- What company are you with?

32:42.669 --> 32:44.797
- North Trust insurance.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.339
I've known the guy a long time.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.133
Never heard of it.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.133
You sure he's legit?

32:48.174 --> 32:50.260
Of course it's legit.

32:48.174 --> 32:50.260
Come on, dad.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.011
Don't be naive,

32:50.302 --> 32:52.011
there are schemers about

32:52.053 --> 32:53.472
preying on the naive.

32:53.513 --> 32:54.765
John Kendall.

32:54.807 --> 32:57.142
John was drinking

32:54.807 --> 32:57.142
at a party, met a fellow

32:57.183 --> 32:58.894
switched all of his

32:57.183 --> 32:58.894
coverage to the guy.

32:58.936 --> 33:00.854
Wrote him a huge check

32:58.936 --> 33:00.854
on the spot.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.564
Then he suffered

33:00.896 --> 33:02.564
earthquake damage

33:02.606 --> 33:04.608
'and there was no record

33:02.606 --> 33:04.608
of the insurance transaction.'

33:04.650 --> 33:06.526
It was a scam, now he's

33:04.650 --> 33:06.526
working at the gift shop

33:06.568 --> 33:07.653
at the Grand Ol' Opry.

33:07.694 --> 33:08.987
Horrid music.

33:09.028 --> 33:10.614
Sells cowboy shirts

33:09.028 --> 33:10.614
and toy banjos.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.240
I've known my guy

33:10.656 --> 33:12.240
for a while.

33:12.282 --> 33:14.367
You been to his office,

33:12.282 --> 33:14.367
checked out his operation?

33:14.409 --> 33:15.577
I just deal with him

33:14.409 --> 33:15.577
over the phone.

33:15.619 --> 33:16.912
Ah.

33:16.954 --> 33:19.038
- What?

33:16.954 --> 33:19.038
- Hubert Lansing.

33:19.080 --> 33:22.501
Fell prey to a telephone scam

33:19.080 --> 33:22.501
running out of Estonia.

33:22.542 --> 33:25.378
Took his life with a track

33:22.542 --> 33:25.378
and field starter's pistol.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.589
On your mark, get set,

33:25.420 --> 33:27.589
die awkwardly.

33:27.631 --> 33:29.132
(Richard)

33:27.631 --> 33:29.132
'It's not funny, Lorelai.'

33:29.174 --> 33:31.259
The fact is, both of you

33:29.174 --> 33:31.259
have significant assets

33:31.301 --> 33:32.552
and both of you are targets.

33:32.594 --> 33:34.596
- Targets?

33:32.594 --> 33:34.596
- How are we targets?

33:34.638 --> 33:35.973
You own your home.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.641
So every homeowner

33:36.014 --> 33:37.641
is a target?

33:37.683 --> 33:40.185
And an inn

33:37.683 --> 33:40.185
with a 26 Zagat rating.

33:40.226 --> 33:41.895
Okay, so that's two things.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.563
Two very valuable things.

33:43.605 --> 33:44.940
The Dragonfly

33:43.605 --> 33:44.940
is one of the highest

33:44.982 --> 33:46.358
rated places in the area.

33:46.399 --> 33:48.610
And Luke owns his diner

33:46.399 --> 33:48.610
and the building it's in

33:48.652 --> 33:50.487
and the building next door

33:48.652 --> 33:50.487
with the soda shop.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.656
That's another

33:50.529 --> 33:52.656
significant holding.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.033
Wait, did you put a PI

33:52.698 --> 33:55.033
on our tail or something?

33:55.074 --> 33:56.994
How do you know about Luke's

33:55.074 --> 33:56.994
real-estate holdings?

33:57.035 --> 33:58.203
Because he told me

33:57.035 --> 33:58.203
all about them

33:58.244 --> 33:59.621
when we played golf last year.

33:59.663 --> 34:00.998
- You did?

33:59.663 --> 34:00.998
- Yeah.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.667
Who in the world

34:01.039 --> 34:03.667
would target us?

34:03.709 --> 34:05.711
Grifters, con men.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.711
They know all the tricks.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.337
Joe Collins.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.630
Oh, my God, the two of you

34:07.379 --> 34:08.630
have more stories

34:08.672 --> 34:09.923
than Somerset Maugham.

34:09.965 --> 34:11.633
Well, your father

34:09.965 --> 34:11.633
has seen it all.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.426
And I must say

34:13.468 --> 34:15.637
your daughter coming out of

34:13.468 --> 34:15.637
left field raised a red flag.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.055
My daughter?

34:17.096 --> 34:18.557
- Do you think she's a grifter?

34:17.096 --> 34:18.557
- Of course not.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.225
But the people

34:18.598 --> 34:20.225
around her could be.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.394
It's just that the timing

34:20.266 --> 34:22.394
is a little suspicious.

34:22.435 --> 34:24.813
Right when Luke's about

34:22.435 --> 34:24.813
to marry a woman of means.

34:24.855 --> 34:26.231
I'm not a woman of means!

34:26.272 --> 34:27.941
Stars Hollow real estate

34:26.272 --> 34:27.941
is skyrocketing.

34:27.983 --> 34:30.819
It's gone up 43%

34:27.983 --> 34:30.819
in the last four years.

34:30.861 --> 34:33.488
- It has, I heard that too, 43%.

34:30.861 --> 34:33.488
- That much?

34:33.530 --> 34:36.282
This daughter of yours,

34:33.530 --> 34:36.282
you saw substantiation?

34:36.324 --> 34:37.993
Well, there was a DNA test.

34:38.035 --> 34:39.786
That she performed herself,

34:38.035 --> 34:39.786
as I understand it?

34:39.828 --> 34:41.371
Isn't that what you said?

34:41.413 --> 34:43.874
- Well, yeah, but--

34:41.413 --> 34:43.874
- But her uncle helped her.

34:43.916 --> 34:46.167
And he's authorized

34:43.916 --> 34:46.167
to perform such a procedure?

34:46.209 --> 34:48.003
- I think so.

34:46.209 --> 34:48.003
- You never confirmed it?

34:48.045 --> 34:49.546
I saw a picture of him and, uh

34:49.588 --> 34:51.924
he was standing

34:49.588 --> 34:51.924
right next to a microscope.

34:51.965 --> 34:53.759
Under the circumstances

34:51.965 --> 34:53.759
I think it's best

34:53.800 --> 34:55.427
to take

34:53.800 --> 34:55.427
every possible precaution.

34:55.468 --> 34:56.929
For our protection,

34:55.468 --> 34:56.929
as well.

34:56.970 --> 34:58.972
- Your protection?

34:56.970 --> 34:58.972
- We're all connected now.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.933
You're our daughter,

34:59.014 --> 35:00.933
and come June third

35:00.974 --> 35:02.434
Luke will be our son in law.

35:02.475 --> 35:03.977
They could come

35:02.475 --> 35:03.977
after your assets

35:04.019 --> 35:06.021
then Luke's assets,

35:04.019 --> 35:06.021
then our assets.

35:06.063 --> 35:07.105
We could be wiped out.

35:07.146 --> 35:08.356
So this is about

35:07.146 --> 35:08.356
protecting you.

35:08.398 --> 35:10.108
It's about protecting all of us.

35:10.149 --> 35:12.778
- We're all in this together.

35:10.149 --> 35:12.778
- All four of us.

35:12.819 --> 35:15.822
Get dessert ready, Leticia.

35:12.819 --> 35:15.822
Who wants coffee?

35:15.864 --> 35:17.032
Hmm.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.958
- I don't know if I can drive.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.958
- Well, walk to the car.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.834
Did you know real estate's

35:25.999 --> 35:27.834
gone up that much?

35:27.876 --> 35:30.712
- Not that much.

35:27.876 --> 35:30.712
- My shirt is soaking wet.

35:30.754 --> 35:32.089
I gotta start reading

35:30.754 --> 35:32.089
the business section.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.673
I never knew there were

35:32.130 --> 35:33.673
so many horrible ways

35:33.715 --> 35:35.216
you could lose

35:33.715 --> 35:35.216
everything you own.

35:35.258 --> 35:38.136
Or con men. Con men!

35:35.258 --> 35:38.136
Are there really con men?

35:38.177 --> 35:40.305
I thought they went the way of

35:38.177 --> 35:40.305
Vaudevillians and Trotskyites.

35:40.346 --> 35:42.682
You've gotta double, triple

35:40.346 --> 35:42.682
insure everything you own.

35:42.724 --> 35:44.434
I've gotta learn more

35:42.724 --> 35:44.434
about umbrella policies.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.728
Does Sookie know how much

35:44.476 --> 35:46.728
the Inn has appreciated?

35:46.770 --> 35:47.854
I don't think so.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.272
Because if they

35:47.896 --> 35:49.272
can come after her

35:49.314 --> 35:50.440
they can go after you

35:49.314 --> 35:50.440
'cause you're her partner.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.817
Or, when we get married

35:51.858 --> 35:53.318
they can come after you

35:51.858 --> 35:53.318
because we're married.

35:53.359 --> 35:54.569
And Sookie's

35:53.359 --> 35:54.569
married to Jackson

35:54.611 --> 35:56.488
so they could

35:54.611 --> 35:56.488
go after his farm.

35:56.529 --> 35:57.697
Maybe I should sit down

35:56.529 --> 35:57.697
with Sookie.

35:57.739 --> 35:58.949
And I'll talk to Jackson.

35:58.991 --> 36:00.241
Or maybe we could do it

35:58.991 --> 36:00.241
at the same time

36:00.283 --> 36:03.120
because that way..

36:00.283 --> 36:03.120
No, this is ridiculous.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.330
This is what Gilmores do.

36:05.371 --> 36:08.249
They get in your freakin' head,

36:05.371 --> 36:08.249
and they mess with it.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.002
Oh, they're good at that.

36:10.043 --> 36:11.837
Forget Sookie and Jackson,

36:10.043 --> 36:11.837
they're responsible people.

36:11.878 --> 36:13.421
Dad does the Inn.

36:11.878 --> 36:13.421
We're covered there.

36:13.463 --> 36:15.048
I just need to talk

36:13.463 --> 36:15.048
to my homeowner-policy guy.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.175
- And I'll talk to my guy.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.175
- But in person, right?

36:17.216 --> 36:18.718
You should see his office.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.595
That's what the Hubert Lansing

36:18.760 --> 36:20.595
story taught us.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.305
Or was it John Kendall?

36:22.347 --> 36:24.057
No, no, he's selling

36:22.347 --> 36:24.057
banjos in Nashville.

36:24.099 --> 36:26.059
It was Hubert Lansing.

36:26.101 --> 36:27.477
- So, in person.

36:26.101 --> 36:27.477
- Right.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.604
- I shouldn't worry about April.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.604
- No.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.106
Because if I was a guy

36:29.646 --> 36:31.106
hearing a story

36:31.148 --> 36:32.398
about what happened

36:31.148 --> 36:32.398
to me, the timing

36:32.440 --> 36:33.859
would sound suspicious.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.153
April's 12.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.153
She's not a con man.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.779
Though I know nothing

36:36.194 --> 36:37.779
about her mother.

36:37.821 --> 36:39.990
- Anna's cool.

36:37.821 --> 36:39.990
- You know that for a fact?

36:40.032 --> 36:41.992
Absolutely.

36:40.032 --> 36:41.992
The timing was weird.

36:42.034 --> 36:43.994
But this woman

36:42.034 --> 36:43.994
is very down to Earth

36:44.036 --> 36:45.871
very unmaterialistic.

36:45.912 --> 36:49.248
I trust my gut, and my gut says

36:45.912 --> 36:49.248
there's nothin' bad there.

36:49.290 --> 36:52.669
Okay, good.

36:49.290 --> 36:52.669
I trust your gut, too.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.129
I feel like

36:52.711 --> 36:54.129
I should run in there

36:54.171 --> 36:55.547
and yell at them

36:54.171 --> 36:55.547
about something.

36:55.588 --> 36:56.756
- About what?

36:55.588 --> 36:56.756
- I don't know.

36:56.798 --> 36:57.799
That's what's stopping me.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.051
What is this feeling, this..

36:59.092 --> 37:00.468
...tightness in the chest,

36:59.092 --> 37:00.468
this..

37:00.510 --> 37:02.595
...anger mixed

37:00.510 --> 37:02.595
with paralyzing weakness?

37:02.637 --> 37:04.514
You've been Gilmored.

37:04.556 --> 37:05.932
But, you know

37:04.556 --> 37:05.932
what the weird thing is?

37:05.974 --> 37:08.476
They referred

37:05.974 --> 37:08.476
to us as family, you, me.

37:08.518 --> 37:09.769
Yeah, what was that about?

37:09.811 --> 37:11.646
Well, I think

37:09.811 --> 37:11.646
in some twisted way

37:11.688 --> 37:14.191
that may have been them actually

37:11.688 --> 37:14.191
validating us as a couple.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.608
Wow, that is twisted

37:14.273 --> 37:15.608
and weird.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.110
Yeah.

37:17.152 --> 37:18.904
Well, I think I can walk now.

37:17.152 --> 37:18.904
Can you walk?

37:18.945 --> 37:21.280
- Yeah.

37:18.945 --> 37:21.280
- Alright.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.241
Why did she say

37:21.322 --> 37:23.241
June third?

37:23.282 --> 37:25.118
Oh, it's

37:23.282 --> 37:25.118
old information.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.412
- They're always a step behind.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.412
- Right.

37:27.453 --> 37:29.748
Hey, which one

37:27.453 --> 37:29.748
was Somerset Maugham?

37:35.420 --> 37:37.214
- 'Hello?'

37:35.420 --> 37:37.214
- Lor, it's me.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.715
Uh, you busy? Can you talk?

37:38.757 --> 37:40.175
How come you have

37:38.757 --> 37:40.175
"I've got the government's

37:40.217 --> 37:41.426
"secret microchip

37:40.217 --> 37:41.426
in my briefcase

37:41.467 --> 37:42.677
and they're on to me" voice?

37:42.719 --> 37:44.888
- Do I? Sorry.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.888
- 'What's wrong?'

37:44.930 --> 37:47.473
Nothing. I-I just finished

37:44.930 --> 37:47.473
having dinner with Rory.

37:47.515 --> 37:48.975
Oh, yeah.

37:47.515 --> 37:48.975
How did the tour go?

37:49.017 --> 37:50.560
Did she take you

37:49.017 --> 37:50.560
to stare at the old books?

37:50.602 --> 37:52.353
'Cause that girl loves

37:50.602 --> 37:52.353
staring at the old books.

37:52.395 --> 37:55.107
'Yes, we stared at the old

37:52.395 --> 37:55.107
books. The tour was great.'

37:55.148 --> 37:57.442
I just...I have

37:55.148 --> 37:57.442
to tell you something.

37:57.483 --> 37:58.484
'Okay.'

37:58.526 --> 37:59.527
Now, I'm not sure whether

37:59.569 --> 38:00.570
I'm supposed to do this or not.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.696
Normally I wouldn't because

38:01.738 --> 38:03.198
it feels like a fink-out thing

38:03.240 --> 38:04.699
but I think this falls

38:03.240 --> 38:04.699
under the parent thing.

38:04.741 --> 38:06.492
So that overrules

38:04.741 --> 38:06.492
the fink-out thing.

38:06.534 --> 38:07.953
Catch a wave, bud.

38:06.534 --> 38:07.953
You're drifting.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.955
Rory moved in

38:07.994 --> 38:09.955
with her boyfriend.

38:09.996 --> 38:10.956
What?

38:10.997 --> 38:12.540
Rory moved in

38:10.997 --> 38:12.540
with her boyfriend

38:12.582 --> 38:14.084
and she said

38:12.582 --> 38:14.084
she was gonna tell you

38:14.126 --> 38:15.334
but I thought,

38:14.126 --> 38:15.334
in case she didn't

38:15.376 --> 38:16.461
then I should tell you.

38:16.502 --> 38:18.838
So I did,

38:16.502 --> 38:18.838
and I feel like a fink.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.133
You're not a fink.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.133
When did this happen?

38:21.174 --> 38:23.176
Today. It was all very

38:21.174 --> 38:23.176
spur-of-the-moment.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.343
Hey, tell me about this guy.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.343
Do we hate him?

38:24.385 --> 38:25.804
- 'What?'

38:24.385 --> 38:25.804
- Logan?

38:25.845 --> 38:27.305
Do we hate him?

38:25.845 --> 38:27.305
Am I supposed to hate him?

38:27.346 --> 38:29.474
No, you can feel however

38:27.346 --> 38:29.474
you want about him.

38:29.515 --> 38:31.017
Good,

38:29.515 --> 38:31.017
'cause I think I like him.

38:31.059 --> 38:32.894
He's a cool guy.

38:31.059 --> 38:32.894
Great apartment.

38:32.936 --> 38:34.562
- Funny.

38:32.936 --> 38:34.562
- He's taken, Chris.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.106
I just wanted to make sure

38:34.604 --> 38:36.106
that you didn't hate him

38:36.148 --> 38:37.732
before I committed

38:36.148 --> 38:37.732
to an opinion.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.400
You're entitled

38:37.774 --> 38:39.400
to your own take on him.

38:39.442 --> 38:40.735
What's yours?

38:40.777 --> 38:42.487
Hey, for me,

38:40.777 --> 38:42.487
the jury's out on all you guys.

38:42.528 --> 38:44.072
You can thank Brad Pitt

38:42.528 --> 38:44.072
for that one.

38:44.114 --> 38:47.575
Okay, so,

38:44.114 --> 38:47.575
anyhow, I told you.

38:47.617 --> 38:50.120
Yeah, you told me.

38:50.162 --> 38:54.291
Wow. Our little girl

38:50.162 --> 38:54.291
is living with her boyfriend.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.416
Yeah, I had that moment, too.

38:55.458 --> 38:56.918
It was during

38:55.458 --> 38:56.918
the onion brick

38:56.960 --> 38:58.711
so I had a little distraction,

38:56.960 --> 38:58.711
but I had it.

38:58.753 --> 39:01.298
[phone beeps]

38:58.753 --> 39:01.298
Yeah. Um, hey, hold on.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.882
- Hello?

39:01.339 --> 39:02.882
- 'Mom, it's me.'

39:02.924 --> 39:05.302
Hey, you.

39:02.924 --> 39:05.302
Hold on a sec.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.636
Chris, it's Rory.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.263
Okay, now, I did not tell you.

39:08.305 --> 39:09.973
Do not rat me out.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.017
When she tells you the news,

39:10.015 --> 39:12.017
you have to act surprised, okay?

39:12.058 --> 39:13.476
Yes, I promise.

39:13.518 --> 39:14.811
It'll be like the time

39:13.518 --> 39:14.811
you told me you got

39:14.853 --> 39:16.479
Pat Benatar tickets

39:14.853 --> 39:16.479
for my birthday

39:16.521 --> 39:17.772
but I already knew because

39:16.521 --> 39:17.772
I went through your jeans

39:17.814 --> 39:19.024
looking for the clove

39:17.814 --> 39:19.024
cigarettes.

39:19.065 --> 39:22.152
- You knew?

39:19.065 --> 39:22.152
- Bye, Chris.

39:22.194 --> 39:23.611
Hey, kid, what's going on?

39:23.653 --> 39:26.031
Not much. Having a bad reaction

39:23.653 --> 39:26.031
to an onion brick.

39:26.072 --> 39:27.949
What part of onion brick

39:26.072 --> 39:27.949
do you not understand?

39:27.991 --> 39:30.035
- I gave dad his tour today.

39:27.991 --> 39:30.035
- Yeah!

39:30.076 --> 39:32.329
It was nice. He saw

39:30.076 --> 39:32.329
the campus, we had dinner.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.122
Oh, how very

39:32.370 --> 39:34.122
"7th heaven" of you.

39:34.164 --> 39:37.334
Listen, I have some news,

39:34.164 --> 39:37.334
two pieces of news, actually.

39:37.375 --> 39:41.213
One is good, and one is,

39:37.375 --> 39:41.213
let's say, interesting.

39:41.254 --> 39:42.672
Oh, intrigue.

39:42.714 --> 39:45.383
Well, first,

39:42.714 --> 39:45.383
I was made the new editor

39:45.424 --> 39:46.718
of the "Yale Daily News."

39:46.759 --> 39:49.554
No, really?

39:46.759 --> 39:49.554
Rory, that's awesome.

39:49.595 --> 39:51.264
- It is awesome.

39:49.595 --> 39:51.264
- My God!

39:51.306 --> 39:52.932
I didn't even know

39:51.306 --> 39:52.932
you were up for the job.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.976
I wasn't, actually,

39:52.974 --> 39:54.976
it all kind of happened

39:55.018 --> 39:56.561
at the last minute.

39:56.602 --> 39:59.564
Hey, wasn't Paris the editor

39:56.602 --> 39:59.564
of the "Daily News?"

39:59.605 --> 40:02.525
Yes, she was, which brings me

39:59.605 --> 40:02.525
to my next piece of news.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.569
- Okay.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.569
- Paris was ousted.

40:04.610 --> 40:07.488
And when she found out

40:04.610 --> 40:07.488
that I had taken her place

40:07.530 --> 40:09.241
she kind of kicked me

40:07.530 --> 40:09.241
out of the apartment.

40:09.282 --> 40:10.283
Well, sure.

40:10.325 --> 40:11.868
So I had no place to live

40:11.910 --> 40:14.662
and there were absolutely

40:11.910 --> 40:14.662
no apartments for rent

40:14.704 --> 40:15.747
anywhere near campus.

40:15.788 --> 40:18.457
So...I moved in with Logan.

40:18.499 --> 40:21.336
- Wow, big news!

40:18.499 --> 40:21.336
- Yeah.

40:21.378 --> 40:23.504
'Well, jeez,

40:21.378 --> 40:23.504
tell me about his place.'

40:23.546 --> 40:25.090
'Is it nice?'

40:25.131 --> 40:28.551
- Uh, yeah, it's really nice.

40:25.131 --> 40:28.551
- Where is it?

40:28.593 --> 40:31.179
The Taft building,

40:28.593 --> 40:31.179
right off campus, top floor.

40:31.221 --> 40:33.723
Top floor? Cool.

40:31.221 --> 40:33.723
Good view?

40:33.765 --> 40:36.268
- Great view.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.268
- 'Awesome. How many rooms?'

40:36.309 --> 40:37.518
Dad told you, didn't he?

40:37.560 --> 40:39.687
Oh, come on,

40:37.560 --> 40:39.687
I was doing so well.

40:39.729 --> 40:41.731
- Please.

40:39.729 --> 40:41.731
- 'How did you know?'

40:41.773 --> 40:43.275
Oh, are you kidding me?

40:43.316 --> 40:45.110
"How's the view?

40:43.316 --> 40:45.110
Is his place nice?"

40:45.151 --> 40:46.485
You didn't call me

40:45.151 --> 40:46.485
Hester Prynne once.

40:46.527 --> 40:47.862
Don't be mad at him.

40:47.904 --> 40:49.072
He was just trying

40:47.904 --> 40:49.072
to do the dad thing.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.323
He hated it, by the way.

40:50.365 --> 40:53.118
- I'm not mad.

40:50.365 --> 40:53.118
- 'Good.'

40:53.159 --> 40:54.744
- So?

40:53.159 --> 40:54.744
- So, what?

40:54.786 --> 40:56.913
So, what do you think

40:54.786 --> 40:56.913
of me moving in with Logan?

40:56.955 --> 40:59.082
I'm sorry, do you remember what

40:56.955 --> 40:59.082
happened the last time

40:59.124 --> 41:01.293
I piped in with my opinions

40:59.124 --> 41:01.293
on your life choices?

41:01.334 --> 41:02.794
Mom, come on.

41:02.835 --> 41:04.045
You don't wanna make sure

41:02.835 --> 41:04.045
the pool house is clean first?

41:04.087 --> 41:05.463
'Mom.'

41:05.504 --> 41:08.925
Okay, well, moving in,

41:05.504 --> 41:08.925
that's pretty big.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.676
- I know.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.676
- 'I mean, I don't know.'

41:10.718 --> 41:12.470
'I've never lived with a guy.'

41:12.511 --> 41:14.389
There's that whole thing

41:12.511 --> 41:14.389
about the cow

41:14.431 --> 41:15.598
and the milk's free.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.933
I guess I would hate to think

41:16.975 --> 41:18.310
that you really

41:16.975 --> 41:18.310
moved in with him

41:18.351 --> 41:19.894
because there was

41:18.351 --> 41:19.894
a housing shortage.

41:19.936 --> 41:21.646
Because it's a big step.

41:21.687 --> 41:23.022
I love him.

41:23.064 --> 41:24.565
Well, I want you to be happy.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.651
I am happy, really happy.

41:26.692 --> 41:29.570
Okay, then.

41:26.692 --> 41:29.570
Congratulations.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.323
- Big day.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.323
- Thanks.

41:31.364 --> 41:33.032
You're gonna have to tell me

41:31.364 --> 41:33.032
how it is living with a guy

41:33.074 --> 41:34.700
before I let Luke move in.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.453
If it's too creepy, he may

41:34.742 --> 41:36.453
have to stay with Babette.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.495
'I will.'

41:37.536 --> 41:38.913
I've heard some horror stories

41:38.955 --> 41:40.623
about toilet seats

41:38.955 --> 41:40.623
you would not believe.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.500
Really? Do tell,

41:40.665 --> 41:42.500
oh, but, wait..

41:42.541 --> 41:44.336
Let me dim the lights

41:42.541 --> 41:44.336
and start the fire.

41:44.377 --> 41:46.504
- 'You have a fireplace?'

41:44.377 --> 41:46.504
- Wood-burning.

41:46.545 --> 41:48.547
I don't think

41:46.545 --> 41:48.547
we can be friends anymore.
