WEBVTT

00:06.440 --> 00:08.220
Detective Ellen Whiting,
Internal Affairs.

00:08.420 --> 00:10.260
I wish I could say this
is the end of it, but I can't.

00:10.460 --> 00:11.860
'Cause the truth is
is I just don't know.

00:12.060 --> 00:13.090
(siren chirps)

00:13.290 --> 00:14.290
Out of the car now.
Hey, whoa, whoa.

00:14.490 --> 00:15.930
Hey!
Stop!

00:16.130 --> 00:18.360
Whiting tipped me off. They're
trying to push for paid leave

00:18.560 --> 00:20.400
for the officer that pulled me
and my little sister over.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.240
I should be able
to drive my

00:22.440 --> 00:25.570
little sister to school without
being perceived as a threat.

00:25.770 --> 00:27.970
I got a long list
of "I should be able," too.

00:28.170 --> 00:30.840
You start addressing
your list, Detective,

00:31.040 --> 00:32.800
I'll be addressing mine.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.420
DEEKS:
<i>So, Rosa, this boy that's</i>
<i>coming over to pick you up...</i>

00:38.620 --> 00:40.520
ROSA:
Steven. I told you about him.
Steven.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.420
Yeah, no, definitely.
We're aware of his existence.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.260
I'm just wondering if this
is just, like, a boy,

00:45.460 --> 00:46.660
it's not like a, like,
it's not like a boyfriend,

00:46.860 --> 00:48.290
right?
Geez, Deeks, pry much?

00:48.490 --> 00:49.400
What?

00:49.600 --> 00:50.930
Right now,
Steven's a boy

00:51.130 --> 00:52.300
who's a friend, but

00:52.500 --> 00:53.700
he's not a boyfriend.
Okay,

00:53.900 --> 00:55.430
but when you say "right now,"
like, are we

00:55.630 --> 00:57.170
progressing towards something?
I love this jacket.

00:57.370 --> 00:58.870
But is it better
than the blue one?

00:59.070 --> 01:00.640
So much better.
It's just a great jacket.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.180
It's not even a choice.
I love it, but my-my question is

01:02.380 --> 01:04.610
why does it matter
if it's not a date?
Mm.

01:04.810 --> 01:07.710
Okay, boomer. Why are adults
so obsessed with labels?

01:07.910 --> 01:09.320
(sighs) Boomer.
God, I wish I had that kind of

01:09.520 --> 01:10.920
disposable income, but no,

01:11.120 --> 01:13.620
sadly, we're Generation X.
We are the middle children,

01:13.820 --> 01:16.360
the MTV generation, the
purveyors of the floppy disk,

01:16.560 --> 01:18.060
and SunnyD.
Okay,

01:18.260 --> 01:19.530
chill out,
latchkey kid.

01:19.730 --> 01:21.330
First of all, it's perfectly
fine to go to a movie

01:21.530 --> 01:22.800
at midnight
with a friend.
Yeah. Ooh.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.260
Thank you, Kensi.

01:24.460 --> 01:25.660
Yeah, no, I-I definitely think
it's okay. I'm just curious

01:25.860 --> 01:28.470
on what the said movie is?
ROSA: An oldie.

01:28.670 --> 01:30.200
<i>10 Things I Hate</i>
<i>About You.</i>

01:30.400 --> 01:31.300
(both gasp)

01:31.500 --> 01:33.370
Okay, first of all,
no joke,

01:33.570 --> 01:34.910
that is one of my
favorite movies of all time.

01:35.110 --> 01:37.880
I love it so much.
Second of all, not an oldie.

01:38.080 --> 01:39.450
DEEKS:
Yeah, who's the boomer now?
But that is

01:39.650 --> 01:41.080
a rom-com, right?
So dreamy.

01:41.280 --> 01:42.650
So, dollars to donuts,

01:42.850 --> 01:44.880
this kid, he thinks
it's a date, Kens.

01:45.080 --> 01:46.090
(sighs)
He thinks it's a date.

01:46.290 --> 01:47.390
(knocking on door)

01:47.590 --> 01:50.060
Oh...
Uh, I-I'm not ready yet.
Stall him.

01:50.260 --> 01:51.990
Oh, yeah,
I'll definitely stall him.
Okay, yup. I'll take that.

01:52.190 --> 01:53.130
I'm gonna run his license plate.

01:53.330 --> 01:54.730
ROSA: Deeks!
I'm kidding.

01:54.930 --> 01:56.430
I'm not kidding. Oh.
(knocking continues)

01:56.630 --> 01:58.660
Little impatient little bugger,
huh? You want to play hard ball?

01:58.860 --> 02:00.370
I'll play hard ball with you.
Ready?

02:00.570 --> 02:01.970
Deeks.
Hey, Whiting.

02:02.170 --> 02:03.770
(door closes)
WHITING: Sorry to bring this

02:03.970 --> 02:05.370
to your door, but you know
all those favors you owe me?

02:05.570 --> 02:06.410
I'm calling them in.

02:06.610 --> 02:08.960
All of them. Right now.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.000
* *

02:31.050 --> 02:33.930
I got a text last night
from an LAPD officer,

02:34.130 --> 02:35.370
Sean Turner.

02:35.570 --> 02:38.440
He was in trouble,
wanted to meet off the record.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.370
But when I got there,

02:40.570 --> 02:42.010
he was dead.

02:42.210 --> 02:43.440
Shot.

02:43.640 --> 02:46.040
Before I could call it in,
I was attacked.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.050
By whom?

02:47.250 --> 02:48.610
Couldn't say.

02:48.810 --> 02:50.450
Male. Maybe six feet.

02:50.650 --> 02:52.420
Wearing a mask,
came at me from behind.

02:52.620 --> 02:54.850
I got a few good hits in
and escaped.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.590
That still doesn't explain
why you're here.

02:57.790 --> 03:00.930
Or why I am,
at this ungodly hour

03:01.130 --> 03:02.700
on a Saturday.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.100
Well, I may not
have seen the guy,

03:04.300 --> 03:05.700
but if I was a betting woman,

03:05.900 --> 03:07.370
I'd say he was a cop.

03:07.570 --> 03:10.340
Now you're starting to see why
I interrupted your beauty sleep.

03:10.540 --> 03:12.610
WHITING:
I ditched my car. Phone, too.

03:12.810 --> 03:13.910
Wasn't sure
if they could track it,

03:14.110 --> 03:15.370
and I went straight to Deeks's.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.580
I didn't know who else
I could turn to.

03:17.780 --> 03:20.110
This is not an accusation
we can take lightly.

03:20.310 --> 03:23.750
I'm assuming that you have
some evidence to back this up.

03:23.950 --> 03:26.120
Well, there's the fact that,
immediately after I escaped,

03:26.320 --> 03:27.420
they put out an APB on me

03:27.620 --> 03:29.150
in connection
to Turner's murder.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.990
Only way they could
get it out that fast

03:31.190 --> 03:32.590
is if the whole thing
was a setup.

03:32.790 --> 03:34.590
Why would a fellow cop
set you up?

03:34.790 --> 03:36.360
I mean, I've never

03:36.560 --> 03:39.100
won any LAPD
popularity contests,

03:39.300 --> 03:40.400
but...
Huh.

03:40.600 --> 03:41.400
Let's just say
my numbers are polling

03:41.600 --> 03:42.600
at an all-time low.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.640
Certain groups were
less than thrilled

03:44.840 --> 03:46.100
that I tipped off Agent Rountree

03:46.310 --> 03:48.210
about the investigation
into his incident.

03:48.410 --> 03:49.410
Yeah, color me curious.

03:49.610 --> 03:51.040
Why did you do that?
You know,

03:51.240 --> 03:52.750
I never wanted to be a part
of that mess in the first place.

03:52.950 --> 03:55.780
As much as it pained me,
the order came from high.

03:55.980 --> 03:58.050
But then...
I got pressured

03:58.250 --> 04:01.220
to push Rountree harder
to drop the complaint.

04:01.420 --> 04:03.690
I mean, it was relentless.

04:03.890 --> 04:04.790
I had to draw a line.

04:04.990 --> 04:08.190
So, you think this was payback.

04:08.390 --> 04:10.930
And you really believe
they'd go to these lengths

04:11.130 --> 04:13.170
over Rountree's investigation?

04:13.370 --> 04:16.240
I mean, the blue wall of silence
is a very real thing,

04:16.440 --> 04:17.540
but there may be
more to it.

04:17.740 --> 04:19.440
When I started looking
into Officer McNeil

04:19.640 --> 04:20.810
after Rountree's
incident,

04:21.010 --> 04:22.980
I started hearing rumors
about a crew of cops

04:23.180 --> 04:25.280
that were running protection
for a fentanyl ring.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.950
I quietly
asked around,

04:27.150 --> 04:29.950
but I think my questions
hit a little too close to home.

04:30.150 --> 04:31.920
Best guess, they wanted
to take me out

04:32.120 --> 04:33.720
before I uncovered too much.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.890
Make it look like
an I.A. bust gone wrong.

04:36.090 --> 04:37.560
How does Turner fit
into all this?

04:37.760 --> 04:38.860
I don't know yet,

04:39.060 --> 04:40.830
but I don't know
who I can trust at the LAPD.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.160
I need your help
to get to the bottom of this.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.830
Prove I'm innocent.

04:45.030 --> 04:47.700
I'll be the first to admit
I don't always like her,

04:47.900 --> 04:51.240
but I've learned not to doubt
her intuition.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.770
Deeks, that may be the nicest
thing you've ever said about me.

04:53.970 --> 04:56.140
Well, it's good to see that
this near-death experience

04:56.340 --> 04:58.540
hasn't rattled
your trademark snark.

04:58.740 --> 04:59.580
KILBRIDE:
Fentanyl.

04:59.780 --> 05:02.850
Deadly even in small doses,

05:03.050 --> 05:06.250
almost impossible to trace
if you mix it with other drugs.

05:06.450 --> 05:09.920
And there has been an uptick
of it on the streets lately.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.990
And if cops are behind this...

05:13.190 --> 05:14.530
All right,

05:14.730 --> 05:16.460
I will contact DEA,

05:16.660 --> 05:18.900
see if I can substantiate
these rumors,

05:19.100 --> 05:21.870
and, in the meantime,
the team can

05:22.070 --> 05:23.600
quietly

05:23.800 --> 05:26.070
look into
Detective Whiting's claims.

05:26.270 --> 05:29.410
But be advised,
Investigator Deeks,

05:29.610 --> 05:31.480
you are on a short leash.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.660
A very short leash.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.720
Any idea why we're here
on a weekend?
(sighs)

05:38.920 --> 05:41.950
No. It wasn't
a welcome call.

05:42.150 --> 05:44.690
I was supposed to get brunch
with Akhil at République.

05:44.890 --> 05:47.030
Do you know how hard it is
to get a reservation there?

05:47.230 --> 05:48.590
Yeah,
tell me about it.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.700
I was supposed to be
at the LAFC game today.

05:50.900 --> 05:53.430
Oh, Tree, you sweet
summer transplant.

05:53.630 --> 05:56.640
Everybody knows that LAFC
is just the flavor of the month.

05:56.840 --> 06:00.170
Okay, Galaxy s the O.G.
L.A. football club.

06:00.370 --> 06:03.240
Wow, okay.
I didn't realize you had

06:03.440 --> 06:05.710
such strong opinions on soccer.
(chuckles)

06:05.910 --> 06:07.150
Comes from my dad.

06:07.350 --> 06:10.920
He was a diehard Aboomoslem fan
back in Mashhad.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.190
He missed soccer
so much here,

06:13.390 --> 06:14.920
until MLS started up.

06:15.120 --> 06:18.590
He's been a Galaxy season ticket
holder ever since.

06:18.790 --> 06:20.490
Well, I feel that,
but nothing beats

06:20.690 --> 06:21.860
the atmosphere at the Banc.

06:22.060 --> 06:23.460
Doesn't beat the Lakers.

06:23.660 --> 06:24.530
Have you been?

06:24.730 --> 06:25.930
That's what
I thought.

06:26.130 --> 06:27.770
You are missing out, my friend.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.740
So, in the next Tráfico,
we're going.

06:29.940 --> 06:31.000
Deal.
(door opens)

06:31.200 --> 06:32.540
But only if my dad can come.
Sure.

06:32.740 --> 06:35.070
He's gonna have to rep
the Galaxy at his own risk.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.410
(chuckles)

06:36.610 --> 06:37.740
Hey, Sam.
Hey.

06:37.940 --> 06:38.810
You have any idea
what's going on?

06:39.010 --> 06:40.210
Unfortunately.

06:40.410 --> 06:42.800
I just got off the phone
with Kilbride. Follow me.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.620
ROUNTREE:
So, let me get this straight,

06:47.820 --> 06:49.220
this woman
defended the LAPD

06:49.420 --> 06:51.960
when they pepper sprayed
me and my little sister,

06:52.160 --> 06:53.790
and we're supposed to just
take her word for all this?

06:53.990 --> 06:56.040
She did tip you off
to McNeil's punishment.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.700
Or lack thereof.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.060
I don't
give a damn that.

06:59.260 --> 07:00.600
That doesn't tell us
whose side she's really on.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.330
We're not gonna take
her word on anything.

07:02.540 --> 07:05.970
Naval Station San Diego
had several fentanyl overdoses

07:06.170 --> 07:08.440
after a group of sailors
returned from liberty in L.A.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.040
Two sailors died.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.380
We're gonna investigate this
ourselves

07:12.580 --> 07:13.950
and find the truth.

07:14.150 --> 07:15.850
FATIMA:
Well, Whiting was right
about one thing,

07:16.050 --> 07:18.450
LAPD didn't waste any time
getting a warrant.

07:18.650 --> 07:19.990
News picked it up.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.250
We need to find out what led
to Officer Turner's death,

07:22.450 --> 07:25.870
and we can't tip off LAPD
that we're looking into it.

07:27.340 --> 07:28.730
Where do we start?

07:28.930 --> 07:30.360
SAM:
Kilbride's heading in now.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.100
I'll meet up with Deeks
on the way to the scene.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.070
We got to get
a better picture of Turner.

07:34.270 --> 07:36.500
We'll never get our hands
on his arrest reports

07:36.700 --> 07:38.270
or his
disciplinary actions,

07:38.470 --> 07:40.270
so, Fatima, I need you
to dive into everything else;

07:40.470 --> 07:42.410
his background,
his personal life.

07:42.610 --> 07:45.080
Anything that looks suspicious
or out of the ordinary.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.150
Copy that.

07:47.350 --> 07:48.210
What about me?

07:48.410 --> 07:50.270
(scoffs)
You're not gonna like it.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.090
Oh, hell no.

07:54.290 --> 07:56.890
Somebody has to keep their eyes
on her at the boatshed.

07:57.090 --> 07:57.960
With all
that's happened,

07:58.160 --> 07:59.260
you don't want to be anywhere

07:59.460 --> 08:00.730
near LAPD.

08:00.930 --> 08:04.050
Especially if this is payback
for her tipping you off.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.700
You're right.

08:06.900 --> 08:08.270
I don't like this.
I don't either.

08:08.470 --> 08:10.950
But sometimes
we just have to do it.

08:16.690 --> 08:19.240
DEEKS:
<i>Is that the sound of the other</i>
<i>shoe officially dropping?</i>

08:19.440 --> 08:20.780
I mean, I know
that you've been

08:20.980 --> 08:22.280
hanging onto these
favors for years,

08:22.480 --> 08:25.380
so, after this,
are we finally even?

08:25.580 --> 08:27.290
You get me out of this,

08:27.490 --> 08:28.920
we're more than even.
And I

08:29.120 --> 08:30.720
did want to apologize
for the clothing.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.030
Kensi's pantsuit collection's
running a little bit thin.

08:34.230 --> 08:35.390
But on the bright side,

08:35.590 --> 08:36.960
no one's gonna
recognize you without one.

08:37.160 --> 08:38.300
Right? It's the
perfect disguise.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.200
Glad to see
my near-death experience

08:40.400 --> 08:42.870
hasn't rattled your trademark
childish insults.
(door opens)

08:43.070 --> 08:44.450
I mean,
you started it.

08:46.390 --> 08:47.740
Yo, can I talk to you
for a second?

08:47.940 --> 08:49.560
Yeah, of course.

08:51.390 --> 08:52.810
(sighs)

08:53.010 --> 08:55.010
Listen, I know she's not
everybody's cup of tea,

08:55.210 --> 08:57.480
including me, especially you.

08:57.680 --> 08:58.920
Yeah, that's putting it lightly.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.320
And you're totally justified,

09:00.520 --> 09:01.650
but I need you to know
that I respect her,

09:01.850 --> 09:03.160
and I trust her.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.290
Even though I do want to
shoot her myself sometimes.

09:05.490 --> 09:07.230
Yeah, maybe,
but that's for you.

09:07.430 --> 09:09.700
Respect is earned, not given.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.500
You ever notice on her neck,

09:11.700 --> 09:13.830
the scar that she has right
here? You know how she got that?

09:14.030 --> 09:15.170
No. What...

09:15.370 --> 09:16.840
She took a bullet for Hetty.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.940
She saved her life.

09:19.140 --> 09:21.310
She almost died in my arms.

09:21.510 --> 09:23.310
(sighs)

09:23.510 --> 09:27.100
Please, just don't
kill each other.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.220
(sighs)

09:30.420 --> 09:32.590
(door opens, closes)
Then there were two.

09:32.790 --> 09:35.850
Three, if you include
the giant elephant in the room,

09:36.050 --> 09:37.940
but who's counting?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.300
Do you really think
it's a good idea

09:51.500 --> 09:53.210
to leave Rountree
and Whiting alone?

09:53.410 --> 09:54.510
He can handle it.

09:54.710 --> 09:56.110
Yeah, but if
they do throw down,

09:56.310 --> 09:57.510
who you taking
in that fight?

09:57.710 --> 09:59.540
I mean, 'cause Rountree's
got muscle, for sure,

09:59.750 --> 10:01.610
but Whiting, I feel like
she's an eye-gouger.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.750
You know what I mean?
A throat puncher.
(chuckles)

10:03.950 --> 10:05.180
A groin kicker.

10:05.380 --> 10:06.950
I'm not playing
this game, Deeks.
All right.

10:07.150 --> 10:08.920
SAM:
That's where Turner was killed.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.260
Looks like LAPD still has
the scene locked down.

10:11.460 --> 10:12.690
Yeah, we got to
keep our distance.

10:12.890 --> 10:14.960
It'd be risky to get close,
especially me.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.430
Mm.
We got a lot
of businesses, right?

10:17.630 --> 10:18.860
There's got to be cameras.

10:19.060 --> 10:20.670
Somebody must've seen everything
that came and went.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.940
Okay. Let's split up.
It'll attract less attention.

10:23.140 --> 10:24.540
You take that side,
I'll take this one.

10:24.740 --> 10:25.840
All right. Let me know
the tale of the tape.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.560
I want those odds
when I get back.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.580
(slurping)

10:30.780 --> 10:33.000
How about the weather?

10:34.930 --> 10:37.350
Any... weekend plans I ruined?

10:37.550 --> 10:38.620
(scoffs)

10:38.820 --> 10:40.150
Just trying
to make conversation.

10:40.350 --> 10:42.390
Here's a conversation,
how's that list going

10:42.590 --> 10:43.590
you're supposed
to be working on?

10:43.790 --> 10:46.910
Never ends. How about yours?

10:49.240 --> 10:51.260
If you're not gonna ask,
I'll just tell you.

10:51.460 --> 10:53.730
LAPD's closing McNeil's case.

10:53.930 --> 10:56.330
Still on
administrative leave,

10:56.530 --> 10:58.590
but no additional punishment.

11:00.020 --> 11:01.610
Shocking.

11:01.810 --> 11:02.710
I know it
doesn't mean much

11:02.910 --> 11:05.280
coming from me, but I am sorry.

11:05.480 --> 11:08.010
You say that like you
had nothing to do with it.

11:08.210 --> 11:10.180
I was just
the I.A. investigator,

11:10.380 --> 11:11.880
and I backed
your take.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.490
We report our findings to the
Professional Standards Bureau.

11:14.690 --> 11:16.390
They're the ones
that decide the punishment.

11:16.590 --> 11:18.690
So it was just out
of your hands?

11:18.890 --> 11:20.390
You know what?
That's convenient.

11:20.590 --> 11:21.730
Seems to be the case
with everyone

11:21.930 --> 11:23.300
I've talked to about this.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.230
And my "take"?

11:25.430 --> 11:27.270
I didn't have a "take."

11:27.470 --> 11:28.730
There was only what happened...

11:28.930 --> 11:30.240
Hey, hey, where are you going?
I mean, as much fun

11:30.440 --> 11:32.920
as this is, I thought
I'd pop out for some sun.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.410
There's a theory
I want to check out.

11:36.610 --> 11:37.640
Not happening.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.180
Well, I'm gonna go,
one way or another,

11:39.380 --> 11:40.380
so you want
to stop me,

11:40.580 --> 11:41.610
shoot me.

11:41.810 --> 11:43.420
Do not tempt me.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.350
You know, I'm starting to see

11:45.550 --> 11:46.820
why you're not
the crowd favorite.

11:47.020 --> 11:49.690
You know what my superpower
is, Rountree?

11:49.890 --> 11:51.790
I don't give a damn
if people like me.

11:51.990 --> 11:52.830
Oh.

11:53.030 --> 11:54.060
I'm I.A.,

11:54.260 --> 11:55.990
almost everyone
I deal with doesn't.

11:56.190 --> 11:58.160
(sighs)
Come on.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.600
You really want to sit in here
in awkward silence

12:00.800 --> 12:02.750
while they're out there
doing the work?

12:05.090 --> 12:05.900
Sooner you help me,

12:06.100 --> 12:08.190
sooner I'm out of your hair.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.530
Just...

12:15.760 --> 12:17.150
Hey, how's it going
with Whiting?

12:17.350 --> 12:18.420
ROUNTREE (over phone):
It's-it's going.

12:18.620 --> 12:20.550
She wants to leave

12:20.750 --> 12:23.810
and, um, I'm thinking
about going with her.

12:24.570 --> 12:26.360
Okay, that does not sound
like a good idea.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.160
LAPD is searching for her.

12:28.360 --> 12:29.830
Yeah, I know,
but we'll take my car.

12:30.030 --> 12:31.130
They won't be
looking for it.

12:31.330 --> 12:33.230
Still, Kilbride
would totally freak.

12:33.430 --> 12:34.470
That's why I'm calling you.

12:34.670 --> 12:35.770
Can you cover for me?

12:35.970 --> 12:38.240
Look, I don't think
she's as innocent

12:38.440 --> 12:39.500
as she's claiming to be.

12:39.700 --> 12:40.740
And if she's not,

12:40.940 --> 12:42.670
I'll be there
when she slips up.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.830
Besides, you owe me
for that coffee date.

12:45.930 --> 12:48.850
Okay, fine, but for the record,
I do not like this.

12:49.050 --> 12:51.230
Thank you.
(phone beeps)

12:52.430 --> 12:53.620
Had to check
with your parents?

12:53.820 --> 12:54.950
Did they say
you can come out and play?

12:55.150 --> 12:57.040
Come on, before
I change my mind.

13:05.610 --> 13:06.770
This is the spot.

13:06.970 --> 13:08.500
<i>(Rountree sighs)</i>

13:08.700 --> 13:11.740
What conspiracy theory are you
actually hoping to unveil here?

13:11.940 --> 13:15.010
You'll see.
Now, we wait.

13:15.210 --> 13:16.260
Great.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.360
What happened to your gun?

13:22.100 --> 13:23.480
I saw your holster
by your clothes

13:23.680 --> 13:25.380
and realized your gun
was missing.

13:25.580 --> 13:26.890
Lost it
when I was attacked.

13:27.090 --> 13:29.020
Sure you didn't shoot Turner
first and then ditch it?

13:29.220 --> 13:31.620
That doesn't even make sense.
Why would I kill him?

13:31.820 --> 13:33.590
I hadn't even talked to him
until last night.

13:33.790 --> 13:35.560
So you claim.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.330
(line rings)

13:37.530 --> 13:38.930
Hey, Fatima,

13:39.130 --> 13:42.220
can you check and see if LAPD
found any guns on the scene?

13:43.390 --> 13:45.100
Yeah, thanks.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.340
So, you're really not gonna
tell me why we're here?

13:47.540 --> 13:49.060
Get down.

13:52.390 --> 13:55.310
This was a great idea.

13:55.510 --> 13:57.120
What's the update,
Agent Namazi?

13:57.320 --> 14:00.620
LAPD released a video
from the scene, and, uh,

14:00.820 --> 14:02.190
it's...

14:02.390 --> 14:03.590
(sighs)

14:03.790 --> 14:04.820
KILBRIDE:
Well, that doesn't exactly

14:05.020 --> 14:06.590
help her case.
Yeah.

14:06.790 --> 14:08.880
Then, a few moments
later...

14:10.880 --> 14:12.530
KILBRIDE:
Doesn't show
Turner arriving?

14:12.730 --> 14:15.270
No, but it came
from LAPD,

14:15.470 --> 14:17.000
so...

14:17.200 --> 14:18.800
Yeah.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.440
Hopefully, Sam and Deeks
can find an angle

14:21.640 --> 14:23.190
that caught more.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.180
What'd you find?

14:26.380 --> 14:28.010
Well, they got a great deal
on tandem bike rentals

14:28.210 --> 14:30.820
if you want to share a ride
down the strand.

14:31.020 --> 14:33.550
Split a bowl of spaghetti
like <i>Lady and the Tramp?</i>

14:33.750 --> 14:35.390
(laughs)
No? All right.

14:35.590 --> 14:36.960
That's your loss.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.490
Other than that, all the, uh,
exterior cameras, their wires

14:39.690 --> 14:42.560
were cut, but there's no sign
of vandalism and no break-ins,

14:42.760 --> 14:44.700
like every other shop
on this block.

14:44.900 --> 14:46.260
Same thing
down there.

14:46.460 --> 14:48.230
So, we get a bunch of cameras
that are tampered with

14:48.430 --> 14:50.800
on the same street
on the same night

14:51.000 --> 14:52.700
that a cop was killed? I mean,

14:52.900 --> 14:54.440
what's the chances
that's just bad luck?

14:54.640 --> 14:56.270
Somewhere between slim and none.

14:56.470 --> 14:58.510
Whoever did this,
they wanted to control

14:58.710 --> 15:00.580
what was seen in this area.
And what wasn't seen.

15:00.780 --> 15:02.850
I mean, Whiting's not gonna
go through all that trouble

15:03.050 --> 15:05.450
to get rid of all those cameras,
but leave the one

15:05.650 --> 15:08.290
that makes her look
the most guilty, which means...

15:08.490 --> 15:11.470
There could be some truth
to her story.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.340
Mom is still M.I.A.?

15:23.540 --> 15:26.070
Probably reading <i>Zen and the Art</i>
<i>of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>

15:26.270 --> 15:27.810
with her throuple in Barstow.

15:28.010 --> 15:31.540
Ugh. All right, keep me posted.
I love you.

15:31.740 --> 15:33.410
(sighs)

15:33.610 --> 15:34.810
Kensi good?
Pssh.

15:35.010 --> 15:37.250
If by "good" you mean
using every evasion tactic

15:37.450 --> 15:39.020
under the sun
to avoid telling Rosa that

15:39.220 --> 15:41.550
a potential murder suspect
showed up at our door last night

15:41.750 --> 15:43.590
then, yeah,
she's super, super good.

15:43.790 --> 15:46.090
So Rosa didn't see Whiting?
No.

15:46.290 --> 15:49.160
Thank God she didn't,
but we had to cancel her plans,

15:49.360 --> 15:50.500
and she wants an explanation.

15:50.700 --> 15:54.000
Well, there's no
perfect parent, Deeks.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.100
As long as you tell her
what's real, she'll understand.

15:56.300 --> 15:58.600
If not now, when she gets older.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.690
(sighs) Hope you're right.

16:01.890 --> 16:03.710
SAM:
Something's not adding up.

16:03.910 --> 16:06.480
We need to talk to someone
who actually knew Turner.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.010
He was married, right?

16:08.210 --> 16:10.080
Yeah, might be risky, though,
talking to the wife

16:10.280 --> 16:11.420
this soon after his death.

16:11.620 --> 16:12.850
They probably got eyes on her.

16:13.050 --> 16:14.690
But it may be the only way
for us to find out

16:14.890 --> 16:16.020
what he was actually doing here.

16:16.220 --> 16:17.420
(engine starts)

16:17.620 --> 16:18.620
Fatima.
FATIMA: Hey.

16:18.820 --> 16:21.030
Send us Turner's
address.
Copy that.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.760
<i>(phone chimes)</i>

16:22.960 --> 16:24.300
What do you know,

16:24.500 --> 16:25.730
LAPD didn't find
any other guns

16:25.930 --> 16:27.530
on the scene
except for Turner's.

16:27.730 --> 16:29.770
You're not that naive. Of course

16:29.970 --> 16:31.770
that's what they're saying.
Doesn't mean they don't have it.

16:31.970 --> 16:33.810
I don't think they want
to take me in alive.

16:34.010 --> 16:35.670
Probably gonna plant it
after the fact.

16:35.870 --> 16:36.980
Give them cause.

16:37.180 --> 16:39.910
You got an excuse
for everything, don't you?

16:40.110 --> 16:41.980
(scoffs)
Look, you better

16:42.180 --> 16:43.120
start giving me something,

16:43.320 --> 16:44.450
or this little field trip
is over.

16:44.650 --> 16:46.630
Or you can cut me some slack.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.950
This is me addressing my list.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.420
ROUNTREE:
Who's that?

16:51.620 --> 16:52.960
WHITING:
Detective Andy Price.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.490
Gang and Narcotics Division.

16:54.690 --> 16:56.360
I think he's mixed up
in all of this somehow,

16:56.560 --> 16:58.000
but I haven't been able
to prove it.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.030
You got us staking out
a detective's house

17:00.230 --> 17:01.130
with a warrant out?

17:01.330 --> 17:02.500
Are you trying to get arrested?

17:02.700 --> 17:04.140
I don't blame you
for not trusting me,

17:04.340 --> 17:06.640
but taking down corrupt cops,
it's what I do.

17:06.840 --> 17:08.240
You want to make
a difference?

17:08.440 --> 17:09.860
Take a leap of faith
with me.

17:14.260 --> 17:15.660
(engine starts)

17:21.740 --> 17:24.120
Yo, what's up?
Turner's house is up the block.

17:24.320 --> 17:25.790
Past the house,
ten o'clock.

17:25.990 --> 17:28.390
Looks like LAPD is keeping
an eye on her.

17:28.590 --> 17:29.660
DEEKS:
Uh-huh.

17:29.860 --> 17:31.460
I think I saw a walkway
behind the house.

17:31.660 --> 17:33.580
Maybe we can enter
through there.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.540
Thanks for agreeing to speak
with us, Mrs. Turner.

17:40.740 --> 17:42.270
Extremely sorry for your loss.

17:42.470 --> 17:44.280
Thanks. Have a seat.

17:44.480 --> 17:48.410
Um, some of the other wives from
the department were here before,

17:48.610 --> 17:50.180
but I sent them home.

17:50.380 --> 17:52.220
Needed time alone.

17:52.420 --> 17:53.890
But my sister

17:54.090 --> 17:57.060
is coming in from Ohio tonight
to help with the funeral.

17:57.260 --> 17:59.390
Sorry, did you guys
work with Sean?

17:59.590 --> 18:01.060
No.

18:01.260 --> 18:03.260
Sorry, all I can say is we're...

18:03.460 --> 18:04.860
assisting with the case.

18:05.060 --> 18:07.230
More secrets.

18:07.430 --> 18:09.470
Guess I can't say I'm surprised.

18:09.670 --> 18:12.000
That's all Sean's life was
of late, one big secret.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.810
What do you mean by that?

18:14.010 --> 18:15.770
He was obsessed with his job.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.960
Wanted to rise through the ranks
and make detective.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.250
But he could never tell me
what he was doing

18:22.450 --> 18:23.850
or where
he was going.

18:24.050 --> 18:25.850
Some nights,
he wouldn't even come home.

18:26.050 --> 18:28.690
And then, when he was home, he
wasn't interested in anything.

18:28.890 --> 18:32.360
No focus. No joy.
He was constantly sick,

18:32.560 --> 18:33.690
working himself
to death.

18:33.890 --> 18:35.290
I hardly
recognized him.

18:35.490 --> 18:38.630
You said "constantly sick,"
can you elaborate on that?

18:38.830 --> 18:41.430
His immune system was shot.

18:41.630 --> 18:43.940
Lack of sleep.

18:44.140 --> 18:47.110
He was always
depressed or anxious.

18:47.310 --> 18:48.570
Could barely function.

18:48.770 --> 18:51.780
Some nights, I'd hear him
throwing up, and...

18:51.980 --> 18:54.550
I wanted to give him
my support,

18:54.750 --> 18:57.830
and I hate what
that job did to him.

18:58.770 --> 19:01.170
He only wanted
to help people. (crying)

19:02.040 --> 19:05.860
LAPD share any of the details
or circumstances of his death?

19:06.060 --> 19:08.210
No, they only
told me he died.

19:09.110 --> 19:11.160
The news said they have
a suspect, though,

19:11.360 --> 19:12.700
and they're trying to find her.

19:12.900 --> 19:15.530
But I've never even seen
that woman, Ellen Whiting.

19:15.730 --> 19:18.070
Why would she want to hurt Sean?

19:18.270 --> 19:19.640
Why would anyone?

19:19.840 --> 19:20.910
(shuddering breath)

19:21.110 --> 19:22.440
Can you excuse me for a second?

19:22.640 --> 19:23.610
Of course, of course.
Take your time.

19:23.810 --> 19:25.160
DEEKS:
Thank you.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.880
Every symptom
she just rattled off

19:31.080 --> 19:32.680
is synonymous
with opiate addiction.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.650
If Turner was part of that ring
and using the fentanyl

19:35.850 --> 19:38.360
they were trafficking,
he was a liability.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.890
So, if they take him out,

19:40.090 --> 19:41.930
they think maybe we can kill
two birds with one stone,

19:42.130 --> 19:43.530
they take out Whiting for good.

19:43.730 --> 19:45.130
And do we want to talk
about the fact that

19:45.330 --> 19:48.630
LAPD didn't question
the wife of a murder victim?

19:48.830 --> 19:51.920
You don't need to if you already
know what happened.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.680
All right, Price,

20:02.880 --> 20:04.250
what are you up to?

20:04.450 --> 20:07.590
Oh, look at that, just a couple
of old pals catching up.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.320
You said Price is in
Gang and Narcotics, so...

20:10.520 --> 20:13.880
(phone camera clicking)
...this guy could be
an undercover or a C.I.

20:15.110 --> 20:16.160
(comm beeps)

20:16.360 --> 20:17.700
What up, Rountree?

20:17.900 --> 20:19.530
ROUNTREE: Hey, Fatima,
I need an I.D. on the guy

20:19.730 --> 20:20.700
with the long hair.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.400
Copy that.
Searching now.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.240
Searching for what,
Agent Namazi?

20:25.440 --> 20:27.220
I, um...

20:28.560 --> 20:30.340
KILBRIDE:
Did Agent Rountree leave

20:30.540 --> 20:32.480
Detective Whiting
at the boatshed?

20:32.680 --> 20:33.910
And before you say another word,

20:34.110 --> 20:36.410
don't even think
of telling me that

20:36.610 --> 20:38.720
this is some sort of
medical emergency

20:38.920 --> 20:40.490
for a dog that he doesn't have.

20:40.690 --> 20:42.950
Well, it's not quite that, sir,

20:43.150 --> 20:44.590
but...

20:44.790 --> 20:46.840
Whiting is actually
with Rountree.

20:48.210 --> 20:50.010
Put him on speaker.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.510
Sorry.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.530
KILBRIDE: Agent Rountree,
you had better have

20:55.730 --> 20:57.840
a good explanation
for your actions.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.310
We are sticking
our neck out here,

21:00.510 --> 21:03.010
and every minute that the two
of you are in the field,

21:03.210 --> 21:05.310
increases the chances
that this will blow up

21:05.510 --> 21:06.880
in our face.
Now, in my day...

21:07.080 --> 21:08.680
Sorry to interrupt, but

21:08.880 --> 21:11.020
this long-haired guy here
is Scott Upson.

21:11.220 --> 21:13.150
He's a part of a street gang
called The Unwanted.

21:13.350 --> 21:15.390
They're known for
drug trafficking opiates,

21:15.590 --> 21:17.020
specifically
fentanyl.

21:17.220 --> 21:19.520
And here, he's talking
with Detective Andy Price,

21:19.720 --> 21:21.180
LAPD.

21:23.140 --> 21:25.330
You're not off the hook,
Rountree.

21:25.530 --> 21:28.770
But the DEA says that
they have been circling

21:28.970 --> 21:31.770
a fentanyl ring with ties
to this same gang,

21:31.970 --> 21:34.040
only they haven't been able
to get close.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.510
Now, if they're being protected

21:35.710 --> 21:37.070
by police,
that may be why.

21:37.270 --> 21:40.750
And, seeing as how
even a disobedient squirrel

21:40.950 --> 21:43.450
will find a nut
every once in a while,

21:43.650 --> 21:46.850
we will return to your
insubordination at a later time.

21:47.050 --> 21:48.790
You keep an eye on them.

21:48.990 --> 21:50.150
See what they do.

21:50.350 --> 21:51.660
ROUNTREE: Yes, sir.
(beeps)

21:51.860 --> 21:52.690
Sir, I...

21:52.890 --> 21:54.530
Stow it. And from now on,

21:54.730 --> 21:56.980
I want to know
every move they make.

22:00.550 --> 22:03.130
You owe me big-time.

22:03.330 --> 22:05.300
(beeps)

22:05.500 --> 22:07.070
Hey, Mama D, it's me again.

22:07.270 --> 22:09.140
I thought that fourth time
would be a charm. (chuckles)

22:09.340 --> 22:12.110
Clearly not.
It's not an emergency, though.

22:12.310 --> 22:13.910
It's just a little
time-sensitive.

22:14.110 --> 22:17.520
So don't worry, but if you could
give me a call back,

22:17.720 --> 22:20.150
that would be great, please.

22:20.350 --> 22:21.700
(knock on door)

22:28.440 --> 22:30.040
(knock on door)

22:31.850 --> 22:33.900
(beeps, unlocks)

22:34.100 --> 22:35.770
Who is at the door?

22:35.970 --> 22:37.130
Stay in your room.
Close the door, please.

22:37.330 --> 22:39.920
Go, Rosa, please.

22:46.860 --> 22:48.080
Can I help you?

22:48.280 --> 22:51.380
Hey, I'm looking for
Martin Deeks.

22:51.580 --> 22:52.580
Is he home at the moment?

22:52.780 --> 22:54.450
Why? Who's asking?

22:54.650 --> 22:56.250
I'm a detective with LAPD.

22:56.450 --> 22:57.860
I need to ask him about
one of my colleagues

22:58.060 --> 22:59.520
we have a mutual
connection with.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.190
Yeah? Do you have a badge?

23:01.390 --> 23:03.800
Ah, sorry.
(snaps fingers)

23:04.000 --> 23:06.300
Left it in the car.
Force of habit.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.800
That's just an inconvenient
habit, isn't it?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.820
How am I supposed to know
you are who you say you are?

23:12.620 --> 23:15.870
Listen, I'm only looking for
Detective Whiting.

23:16.070 --> 23:19.480
I know that Deeks has
a relationship with her.

23:19.680 --> 23:20.910
How about you let me
come inside,

23:21.110 --> 23:22.610
I'll take a look around,
then I'll be on my way?

23:22.810 --> 23:25.550
That's not gonna happen.

23:25.750 --> 23:27.020
You really want to obstruct

23:27.220 --> 23:29.290
an official homicide
investigation?

23:29.490 --> 23:32.020
What I want

23:32.220 --> 23:35.080
is for you to get
the hell off my porch.

23:38.810 --> 23:41.930
All right.

23:42.130 --> 23:45.020
But you're backing
the wrong side on this one.

23:46.590 --> 23:50.390
I hope you have a lovely,
lovely day now.

23:52.390 --> 23:54.430
Stay safe.

24:15.680 --> 24:19.800
WHITING:
Oh, Price, you bad, bad boy.
(phone chimes)

24:20.000 --> 24:21.470
Oh, Kensi just sent
a photo of the cop

24:21.670 --> 24:22.540
who came to her house.

24:22.740 --> 24:24.280
Do you recognize this guy?

24:24.480 --> 24:27.980
That's Detective Nick Sills.
Price's partner.

24:28.180 --> 24:31.220
Son of a bitch. Last night
I tore the guy's mask, cut him.

24:31.420 --> 24:34.020
Right where that gash is.
Oh...

24:34.220 --> 24:36.290
Uh-oh, looks like
there's trouble brewing

24:36.490 --> 24:37.710
in paradise.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.700
Starting to believe me now?

24:43.900 --> 24:45.650
(engine starts in distance)

24:52.190 --> 24:54.370
Whiting. Whiting!

24:54.570 --> 24:55.370
Aw...

24:55.570 --> 24:58.790
Hey you, LAPD.

25:23.690 --> 25:28.090
Drop it. Slowly. Slowly!

25:33.130 --> 25:34.180
Where'd you get that?

25:34.380 --> 25:36.900
Had it the whole time.

25:38.730 --> 25:40.350
Relax. We're on
the same team.

25:40.550 --> 25:42.840
Are we?
(handcuffs click)

25:48.140 --> 25:50.330
I don't have to do this.

25:50.530 --> 25:52.050
I'll take a leap of faith, too.

26:00.890 --> 26:02.170
DEEKS:
<i>Where was she?</i>

26:02.370 --> 26:04.610
Well, she said she was
"getting her gong on"

26:04.810 --> 26:06.010
at some naturist
Earthing ceremony,

26:06.210 --> 26:08.710
which apparently is the practice
of connecting

26:08.910 --> 26:10.920
to the Earth's energy through
the vibrations of your body,

26:11.120 --> 26:12.050
au naturel.

26:12.250 --> 26:13.750
Oh, dear Lord.

26:13.950 --> 26:15.150
And then they take your phone
when you unveil yourself

26:15.350 --> 26:16.450
to the universe, and so that's

26:16.650 --> 26:17.790
why she was not
answering her phone.

26:17.990 --> 26:19.690
I don't even know why I ask,

26:19.890 --> 26:21.690
'cause I don't want
to know these things.

26:21.890 --> 26:23.360
What-- Is she on her way?

26:23.560 --> 26:25.460
She should be here soon,
so I gotta go.

26:25.660 --> 26:26.760
Rosa's almost ready.

26:26.960 --> 26:27.930
Okay. I love you.
I'll see you in a bit.

26:28.130 --> 26:29.980
Love you, too. Bye.

26:30.820 --> 26:32.600
Why do I have to go
to Bertie's?

26:32.800 --> 26:34.370
Does it have something
to do with last night?

26:34.570 --> 26:35.870
Or the man that was
at the door?

26:36.070 --> 26:39.210
Everything is going
to be all right, I promise.

26:39.410 --> 26:40.750
You know you can tell me.

26:40.950 --> 26:42.280
You don't have to
treat me like a kid.

26:42.480 --> 26:46.080
I know. Although Deeks and I
would like you to be able

26:46.280 --> 26:48.450
to be 17 sometimes, Rosa.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.420
You've dealt with
enough already.

26:50.620 --> 26:52.420
That's why I can handle it.

26:52.620 --> 26:54.830
I have no doubt about that.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.360
But there are parts
of our job

26:56.560 --> 26:57.930
that we just can't tell you.

26:58.130 --> 26:59.730
It's not that we don't think
you can handle it,

26:59.930 --> 27:02.870
it's just there are rules,
and we have to follow them.

27:03.070 --> 27:05.000
Plus, it could compromise
your safety.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.340
Does that make sense?

27:06.540 --> 27:08.470
Yeah, I guess so.
(horn honks)

27:08.670 --> 27:10.590
That's Roberta.
Time to go.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.310
Can you at least call me later?

27:14.510 --> 27:16.680
Yes. Of course I will.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.080
And also, um, if she
takes you anywhere

27:19.280 --> 27:22.140
with the word "Earthing" in it,
you call me immediately.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.290
FATIMA:
<i>Hey, guys?</i>

27:25.490 --> 27:26.820
Go ahead, Fatima.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.760
Okay, so Price was meeting
someone in a gang known

27:28.960 --> 27:30.090
for dealing fentanyl.

27:30.290 --> 27:31.830
Whiting and Rountree
detained him.

27:32.030 --> 27:34.570
So if Price's partner is
the one that attacked Whiting,

27:34.770 --> 27:36.230
and Price was meeting
with a gang member

27:36.430 --> 27:37.530
tied to fentanyl trafficking...

27:37.740 --> 27:39.500
There's no way
this is not connected.

27:39.700 --> 27:40.770
FATIMA:
And there is more.

27:40.970 --> 27:42.140
A friend in the M.E.'s office

27:42.340 --> 27:44.210
slipped me an early copy
of the report.

27:44.410 --> 27:47.310
They list Turner's time of death
at around 8:00 p.m.

27:47.510 --> 27:50.050
But the text to Whiting
didn't go out until 10:00.

27:50.250 --> 27:51.850
Meaning Turner couldn't have
sent the text.

27:52.050 --> 27:53.180
He'd been dead for two hours.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.920
So Whiting was right.
She was set up.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.550
Somebody wanted her to show up
at the same place

27:56.750 --> 27:57.590
Turner was killed.

27:57.790 --> 27:59.420
So the real question becomes

27:59.620 --> 28:01.610
who was using his phone?

28:03.780 --> 28:05.460
What was in the envelope?
Money?

28:05.660 --> 28:07.560
What envelope?

28:07.770 --> 28:10.670
A gang member,
convicted felon

28:10.870 --> 28:12.470
carrying a prohibited firearm.

28:12.670 --> 28:15.370
That's another felony. What,
three to five years minimum?

28:15.570 --> 28:17.110
Man, I ain't in no gang.

28:17.310 --> 28:18.880
If you ain't in no gang,
why does your file

28:19.080 --> 28:20.390
tell a different story?

28:21.260 --> 28:23.310
Come on, man,
they don't want you.

28:23.510 --> 28:24.980
They want the crooked cops.

28:25.180 --> 28:26.480
Help me and I'll see
what I can do

28:26.680 --> 28:27.750
about that felony charge.

28:27.950 --> 28:29.390
You know what'll happen
if I rat?

28:29.590 --> 28:30.890
I can protect you from Price.

28:31.090 --> 28:34.230
Price? I ain't worried about
snitching on a cop.

28:34.430 --> 28:35.910
Then who you worried about?

28:38.980 --> 28:42.830
I'm gonna need, like,
promises and stuff

28:43.030 --> 28:44.200
that nothing's gonna
happen to me.

28:44.400 --> 28:46.850
Only if you give me something
I can use.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.440
He goes by Odin.

28:50.640 --> 28:52.880
I don't know his real name,
don't know what he looks like.

28:53.080 --> 28:56.480
I've never even seen the guy,
but he runs the show.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.830
And he's got eyes everywhere.

28:59.930 --> 29:01.390
There's been a rise
in fentanyl lately.

29:01.590 --> 29:02.690
Is that Odin, too?

29:02.890 --> 29:04.490
Man, they don't
involve me in that.

29:04.690 --> 29:06.220
I only deal with the payments

29:06.420 --> 29:07.880
and the security for the fights.

29:08.780 --> 29:09.760
What fights?

29:09.960 --> 29:12.700
Underground. Bare knuckle.

29:12.900 --> 29:15.100
The gang puts 'em on.
Takes a cut of the betting.

29:15.300 --> 29:18.220
Then why were you
arguing with Price?

29:20.320 --> 29:22.190
Not too late
to pull that deal.

29:23.790 --> 29:25.380
Word came down that
Odin's getting ready

29:25.580 --> 29:26.810
to pull The Unwanted out of L.A.

29:27.010 --> 29:29.580
Price was not too happy
to hear about it.

29:29.780 --> 29:31.650
When's the gang leaving?

29:31.850 --> 29:35.450
For real, I don't know.
But soon.

29:35.650 --> 29:36.790
(exhales sharply)
All right,

29:36.990 --> 29:38.920
where do we find
this Odin joker?

29:39.120 --> 29:42.390
Ah, gentlemen, just in time
for an update.

29:42.590 --> 29:44.530
WHITING:
Well, Upson says that the gang
has a mysterious leader.

29:44.730 --> 29:46.400
Goes by the name "Odin."

29:46.600 --> 29:49.670
Well, that tracks with what the
DEA knows about The Unwanted.

29:49.870 --> 29:51.740
Their leader has always
been elusive.

29:51.940 --> 29:53.240
But I'm not getting any hits

29:53.440 --> 29:56.270
on Odin as an alias for anyone
associated with the gang.

29:56.470 --> 29:58.040
Well, guy's running
underground fights,

29:58.240 --> 29:59.440
and Upson says Odin
will be there.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.050
I don't think he's
playing with us.

30:01.250 --> 30:03.080
What if the heat from Whiting
and Rountree's incident

30:03.280 --> 30:05.350
with McNeil isn't
making the cops nervous?

30:05.550 --> 30:06.920
It's making Odin nervous.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.490
WHITING:
Yeah, if the gang relies
on these dirty cops

30:08.690 --> 30:10.820
to look the other way so they
can push their product...

30:11.020 --> 30:12.590
Then any of these cops
going down

30:12.790 --> 30:14.030
is gonna compromise
their operation.

30:14.230 --> 30:16.830
I mean, so far we've only seen
Price take a payout.

30:17.030 --> 30:18.760
We've got nothing
to connect the cops

30:18.960 --> 30:20.800
and/or the gang
to the drugs.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.530
Well, this fight is
our best chance

30:22.730 --> 30:24.200
of doing exactly that.

30:24.400 --> 30:27.870
And since we have momentum,
the DEA is happy

30:28.070 --> 30:29.440
to have our assistance.

30:29.640 --> 30:30.980
Odin is the key.

30:31.180 --> 30:34.850
We take him, he gives us
the drugs and the cops.

30:35.050 --> 30:37.410
Now, we're taking this fentanyl
off the street.

30:37.610 --> 30:41.550
Not tomorrow,
not the next day. Tonight.

30:41.750 --> 30:43.120
Okay, but how do we do that?

30:43.320 --> 30:45.160
Gotta get someone
on the inside.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.660
I can't show my face,
for obvious reasons.

30:47.860 --> 30:49.030
Nor can I.

30:49.230 --> 30:50.790
It's too late to backstop
anybody into the gang.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.400
They wouldn't trust it.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.700
Well, from what we've learned,
I mean, these fighters

30:53.900 --> 30:54.970
aren't gang members.

30:55.170 --> 30:57.070
You volunteering,
Agent Rountree?

30:57.270 --> 30:59.720
I was thinking someone
a little bigger.

31:03.220 --> 31:04.310
Oh, hell no.

31:04.510 --> 31:06.310
You have a better idea,
Agent Hanna?

31:06.510 --> 31:07.810
I will if you'll
let me think about it.

31:08.010 --> 31:09.750
I will coordinate
with the DEA.

31:09.950 --> 31:11.220
Agent Rountree,

31:11.420 --> 31:14.250
<i>tell Upson he is replacing</i>
<i>his fighter.</i>

31:14.450 --> 31:18.060
<i>Investigator Deeks,</i>
<i>you and Agent Blye</i>

31:18.260 --> 31:20.420
<i>will take overwatch.</i>

31:20.620 --> 31:25.300
<i>Agent Namazi, you will be</i>
<i>our eyes and ears on the inside.</i>

31:25.500 --> 31:27.970
<i>Agent Hanna, you are</i>
<i>our fighter,</i>

31:28.170 --> 31:29.900
<i>and you are one mean</i>
<i>son of a bitch</i>

31:30.100 --> 31:32.450
<i>who has never been dropped.</i>

31:35.490 --> 31:38.510
<i>Agent Rountree,</i>
<i>you and Detective Whiting</i>

31:38.710 --> 31:40.840
<i>take the surveillance van</i>
<i>and monitor</i>

31:41.050 --> 31:43.250
<i>Agent Namazi's feed.</i>

31:43.450 --> 31:46.370
<i>If Odin is there,</i>
<i>we will find him.</i>

31:48.540 --> 31:51.220
Agent Hanna...

31:51.420 --> 31:53.740
this fight, it's the real deal.

31:54.540 --> 31:57.130
Bare knuckles, no pads,
no protection.

31:57.330 --> 32:00.100
There's even talk
of men being killed.

32:00.300 --> 32:02.470
Now, you just have to
get us inside.

32:02.670 --> 32:06.800
No hero crap. You got
nothing to prove in there.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.010
Understood?

32:08.210 --> 32:09.940
Absolutely.
Good.

32:10.140 --> 32:13.360
'Cause we're only gonna get
one shot at this.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.430
KILBRIDE (over comm):
All right, everybody report in.

32:30.630 --> 32:32.460
We got eyes on the front.

32:32.660 --> 32:33.970
DEA's tac team is on standby.

32:34.170 --> 32:35.570
ROUNTREE:
We're getting settled in
over here.

32:35.770 --> 32:37.130
Fatima, we're ready
for photos.

32:37.330 --> 32:40.070
FATIMA:
We're in. Heading to
the ring now.

32:40.270 --> 32:42.520
(dance music playing)

32:46.230 --> 32:49.280
WHITING:
I see Price and Sills.

32:49.480 --> 32:51.530
These guys aren't
playing around.

32:52.600 --> 32:55.840
* *

33:15.020 --> 33:16.690
All right, darlin'.

33:17.490 --> 33:19.010
That's a pretty girlfriend
you got there.

33:19.210 --> 33:20.890
I wouldn't, if I was you.

33:22.730 --> 33:24.780
She'll do nothin'.
Mm.

33:24.980 --> 33:27.170
You ever ruptured a testicle?

33:28.440 --> 33:29.940
You want to?

33:33.640 --> 33:35.840
I'm really gonna enjoy
breakin' you.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.780
Bigger men have tried.

33:42.620 --> 33:43.900
How you feeling?

33:44.100 --> 33:45.340
I got this.

33:45.540 --> 33:47.670
You just keep an eye out
for Odin, huh?
Okay.

33:47.870 --> 33:49.540
Good.

33:49.740 --> 33:52.060
("Johnny Cash"
by Sons and Daughters plays)

33:53.990 --> 33:55.700
* *

33:58.300 --> 34:01.070
(bell rings)
(crowd cheering)

34:05.270 --> 34:07.490
(indistinct shouting)

34:07.690 --> 34:09.130
(computer beeps)

34:09.330 --> 34:12.000
More gang members,
various affiliations.

34:12.200 --> 34:13.900
Still no one that looks like
they're running the show.

34:14.100 --> 34:15.930
He's gotta be
around here somewhere.

34:16.130 --> 34:19.570
* You began a search,
I know many have tried *

34:19.770 --> 34:22.440
* Not a blind man among you *

34:22.640 --> 34:23.610
* For years let fate decide *

34:23.810 --> 34:25.910
* So swallowed and followed *

34:26.110 --> 34:27.710
* And played through
start to end *

34:27.910 --> 34:30.950
* With the good weight
all carried... *

34:31.150 --> 34:32.850
Table in the back.

34:33.050 --> 34:34.690
WHITING: They're making
some kind of deal.

34:34.890 --> 34:37.090
And they're not betting
on the fights.

34:37.290 --> 34:38.890
He just took something with him.

34:39.090 --> 34:40.490
We may not need Odin
to lead us to the drugs.

34:40.690 --> 34:42.130
They may be on-site.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.630
There's a bunch of gangs here.
They might be unloading to

34:43.830 --> 34:45.230
multiple buyers all at once.

34:45.430 --> 34:46.900
Guys, you want us
to move in?

34:47.100 --> 34:48.730
Negative. Negative.
Hold your positions

34:48.930 --> 34:50.230
till we've located Odin.

34:50.430 --> 34:53.170
DEA's got the perimeter.
No drugs will get through.

34:53.370 --> 34:56.910
* She wrote you a song
and bought a wedding dress *

34:57.110 --> 34:58.810
* Having handsome bite buxom *

34:59.010 --> 35:00.840
* Have insured people met... *

35:01.040 --> 35:02.410
REFEREE:
Guys, break it up.

35:02.610 --> 35:04.010
* Then sundry and nocturnal... *

35:04.220 --> 35:05.720
(bell rings)
Come on, break it up.
Break it up.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.580
* With your new loves,
good fortunes... *

35:07.780 --> 35:09.850
How's it look?

35:10.050 --> 35:12.060
There's something going on
over there.

35:12.260 --> 35:14.760
* *

35:14.960 --> 35:16.390
His eyes have been darting
in that direction

35:16.590 --> 35:18.130
the whole round.

35:18.330 --> 35:20.610
You don't think...

35:22.380 --> 35:24.750
Be a hell of a cover.

35:25.590 --> 35:27.240
(bell rings)

35:27.440 --> 35:28.540
(crowd cheering)

35:28.740 --> 35:30.410
* Can tether no more *

35:30.610 --> 35:32.610
* What's shrunken withers *

35:32.810 --> 35:34.650
* In the path to your door... *

35:34.850 --> 35:36.550
You're hard to track down, Odin.

35:36.750 --> 35:38.250
What the hell
did you just say?

35:38.450 --> 35:40.450
You got a hell of
an operation going on here.

35:40.650 --> 35:41.750
I thought I smelled cop on ya.

35:41.950 --> 35:44.210
Even worse, I'm a Fed.

35:45.340 --> 35:46.390
Execute.

35:46.590 --> 35:49.980
* *

35:50.810 --> 35:52.650
Cops! Everybody out.

35:54.450 --> 35:56.370
* Can tether no more... *

35:56.570 --> 35:58.650
(both grunting)

35:59.450 --> 36:02.220
* In the path to your door *

36:03.390 --> 36:04.540
* Can tether no more... *

36:04.740 --> 36:07.190
Stop! Federal agents.
Freeze.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.030
Deeks?
Go.

36:15.270 --> 36:17.170
(grunting)

36:21.610 --> 36:22.830
Price.

36:23.030 --> 36:25.180
We got eyes on Price.
We're in pursuit.

36:29.780 --> 36:33.720
You're right,
that was very enjoyable.

36:41.060 --> 36:42.930
Still think I'm
on the wrong side?

36:46.970 --> 36:48.270
Okay.

36:50.570 --> 36:51.840
(grunting)

36:54.840 --> 36:59.650
I hope you have a lovely,
lovely time in prison.

37:04.850 --> 37:07.390
(steam hissing)

37:14.300 --> 37:15.800
Whiting!
(gunshots)

37:21.670 --> 37:22.590
(groans)

37:22.790 --> 37:24.760
That is for setting me up.

37:24.960 --> 37:26.120
Whiting, lower your weapon.

37:26.320 --> 37:28.730
Maybe I just end this
right here.

37:28.930 --> 37:30.180
Go ahead, bitch.

37:32.110 --> 37:33.660
Killing me won't make you safe.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.370
You really think
there aren't more of us?

37:35.570 --> 37:37.750
(groans)

37:38.620 --> 37:40.420
Whiting, I'm not asking.

37:42.520 --> 37:45.140
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
throw away my life

37:45.340 --> 37:46.740
on trash like this.

37:46.940 --> 37:49.910
You better watch your backs,
both of you.

37:50.110 --> 37:53.200
You better start exercising
your right to remain silent.

37:54.770 --> 37:56.690
(groaning)

37:56.890 --> 37:58.390
(indistinct radio chatter)

37:58.590 --> 38:02.190
So Fatima and Sam confirmed it.
All the drugs are accounted for.

38:02.390 --> 38:03.960
Nobody slipped past
the perimeter.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.860
Good. LAPD will have to drop
everything they have on Whiting,

38:07.060 --> 38:08.730
which will probably take
a lot of paperwork.

38:08.930 --> 38:10.630
Yeah. Well, you know
what they say.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.200
The real treasure is
the paperwork

38:12.400 --> 38:13.570
we made along the way.

38:13.770 --> 38:15.170
Speaking of which,
you guys mind taking over?

38:15.370 --> 38:17.140
'Cause we gotta get home
before my mom turns Rosa

38:17.340 --> 38:19.810
into some sort of transcendental
motorcycle mechanic.

38:20.010 --> 38:21.410
You're a parent now?

38:21.610 --> 38:24.720
Yeah.
Aw, that poor kid.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.520
How old is she?
17.

38:26.720 --> 38:27.780
We adopted.

38:27.980 --> 38:30.020
Right into the deep end,
didn't you? Yeah.

38:30.220 --> 38:31.720
Definitely.
Yeah. That's what's happening.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.320
Yeah, Steven's 16 now.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.080
Your son's name is Steven?

38:37.040 --> 38:39.760
You don't think that, um...

38:39.960 --> 38:43.000
No. No.
No. No...

38:43.200 --> 38:44.470
Uh, anyway, we'll
finish this up.

38:44.670 --> 38:45.500
You guys take off.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.170
Yeah.
Great. Whiting,

38:47.370 --> 38:49.070
I'd say it's been
a pleasure, but,

38:49.270 --> 38:52.010
as always, it's been
anything but.

38:52.210 --> 38:53.780
Right back at you, Deeks.

38:53.980 --> 38:55.410
Uh, hey, so...

38:55.610 --> 38:58.320
(chuckles)

38:58.520 --> 39:00.100
And then there were two.

39:04.970 --> 39:08.390
Think McNeil had anything
to do with tonight after all?

39:08.590 --> 39:09.930
It's hard to say.

39:10.130 --> 39:11.960
I mean, at the very least,
he led me to them.

39:12.160 --> 39:15.100
Runs in the same circles,
I know that much.

39:15.300 --> 39:16.630
If he wasn't on
administrative leave,

39:16.830 --> 39:18.070
he probably would have
been there tonight.

39:18.270 --> 39:19.940
If McNeil had anything
to do with this,

39:20.140 --> 39:22.060
I'm gonna prove it.

39:23.620 --> 39:25.110
We cool?

39:25.310 --> 39:27.640
We don't have to be cool,
Whiting.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.510
You're LAPD, I'm NCIS.

39:29.710 --> 39:32.750
This is where we go
our separate ways.
Fair enough.

39:32.950 --> 39:34.280
But I owe you.

39:34.490 --> 39:36.650
And when I owe someone,
I'm good for it.

39:36.850 --> 39:38.360
Ask Deeks.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.320
(laughs)

39:40.520 --> 39:42.490
You need help with
anything on your list,

39:42.690 --> 39:44.140
you let me know.

39:48.550 --> 39:49.370
Hey.

39:49.570 --> 39:52.040
You lied earlier.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.640
Oh?

39:53.840 --> 39:56.670
If you didn't care so much about
what people thought about you,

39:56.870 --> 39:58.480
you wouldn't have
apologized to me.

39:58.680 --> 40:01.510
Better not tell anyone.

40:01.710 --> 40:03.900
I have a reputation to uphold.

40:05.770 --> 40:07.120
Till next time.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.450
Hopefully there won't be
a next time.

40:09.650 --> 40:12.560
With you guys, always is.

40:12.760 --> 40:14.560
(door opens)

40:14.760 --> 40:16.360
(sighs)

40:16.560 --> 40:17.880
(door closes)

40:20.180 --> 40:23.200
Ice, ice and more ice.

40:23.400 --> 40:26.600
A lesson I wish I'd learned
earlier in life.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.940
Of course, back in my day
you just kind of cleaned up

40:29.140 --> 40:30.240
with a little rubbing alcohol,

40:30.440 --> 40:33.540
and killed the pain
until last call.

40:33.740 --> 40:36.250
Showed up fresh and ready
for morning colors.

40:36.450 --> 40:38.150
You were a fighter, Admiral?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

40:38.350 --> 40:41.650
Well, you know, smokers
aboard the <i>Iwo Jima</i>

40:41.850 --> 40:43.720
bound for Vietnam.

40:43.920 --> 40:47.820
I was even middleweight
All-Marine at Camp Lejeune.

40:48.020 --> 40:49.660
Now, those were the days.
(chuckles)

40:49.860 --> 40:52.330
How far did you take it?

40:52.530 --> 40:55.300
Oh, I kept it up
through the years, you know.

40:55.500 --> 40:58.130
Even got close to a title once.

40:58.330 --> 41:01.270
Then my son came along.
I don't know,

41:01.470 --> 41:03.410
the risk just didn't seem
all that worth it anymore.

41:03.610 --> 41:07.040
That and all the time
I had to spend training

41:07.240 --> 41:08.550
kept me away from my family,

41:08.750 --> 41:10.150
so I just decided, stop.

41:10.350 --> 41:12.120
Seems like a very good reason.

41:12.320 --> 41:16.120
It's odd.
Even after I quit fighting,

41:16.320 --> 41:20.060
I still just didn't seem
to find the time to spend

41:20.260 --> 41:22.130
with my young family.

41:22.330 --> 41:24.510
You know, duty to the Corps
and all that.

41:25.850 --> 41:28.930
I always told myself that
I was doing my duty

41:29.130 --> 41:31.480
to the Corps for my family.

41:32.750 --> 41:34.470
And the funny thing is,
it seems that

41:34.670 --> 41:39.360
all they really wanted was
for me to be around more.

41:40.630 --> 41:43.280
Then I watched my son

41:43.480 --> 41:46.580
destroy his life with drugs,

41:46.780 --> 41:50.070
fentanyl being the latest
in a long line.

41:51.040 --> 41:55.530
So, any time I spend
keeping that poison away

41:55.730 --> 41:58.800
from somebody else's kid...

41:59.000 --> 42:01.530
damn good day in my book.

42:01.730 --> 42:04.050
How's your son now?

42:06.190 --> 42:08.560
Oh, I called him.

42:09.490 --> 42:12.440
Let's just say it was not
an easy conversation.

42:12.640 --> 42:16.300
If a conversation's hard, it's
probably the one worth having.

42:17.760 --> 42:21.000
Good fighting out there
tonight, Agent Hanna.

42:23.240 --> 42:24.660
Damn good fighting.

42:24.860 --> 42:27.120
Get some rest.

42:27.320 --> 42:29.340
Good night, Admiral.
