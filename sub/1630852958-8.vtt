WEBVTT

00:10.194 --> 00:11.727
This whole
gabriela/gary situation

00:11.762 --> 00:13.128
is ----ing frustrating.

00:13.164 --> 00:14.947
Like, I could have ----ed
gary already.

00:14.999 --> 00:16.365
I could have done it already.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.367
The whole point
of anchor watch

00:18.402 --> 00:21.003
is precisely to make sure
that doesn't happen.

00:21.038 --> 00:22.087
I have to let you go.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.172
I got no choice.

00:23.207 --> 00:24.540
<i> Gary, daisy.</i>

00:24.575 --> 00:26.442
The guests are about
to go swimming.

00:28.629 --> 00:31.447
[bleep]

00:31.482 --> 00:33.966
daisy's doing wine and
everyone's sitting... Seated.

00:34.018 --> 00:35.050
To a great trip.

00:35.086 --> 00:36.118
Ready whenever you are.

00:36.153 --> 00:37.152
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

00:37.188 --> 00:38.754
When you told me that?

00:38.773 --> 00:40.422
I thought gabriela
came down and told you.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.990
Are you serious right now?

00:42.026 --> 00:43.592
What the [bleep], gabi?

00:43.611 --> 00:45.694
How dare you throw me
under the bus like that.

00:47.531 --> 00:50.482
If you end up that direction,
I'd take another coffee.

00:50.534 --> 00:52.801
How is this not uncovered,
it's 7:00?

00:52.837 --> 00:54.403
Kels, can I meet you
in the cockpit?

00:56.107 --> 00:57.790
There's two of us out
on deck, dais.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.575
There's three of you girls
inside for this charter.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.813
That was the problem.
It's not rocket science.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.867
We work around the clock.

01:24.902 --> 01:27.069
She's up the whole night,
from 10:00 at night,

01:27.104 --> 01:28.804
all the way to the morning.

01:28.839 --> 01:30.572
I think it's just a little
bit unfair on her

01:30.608 --> 01:32.074
if she's gotta do the
whole night watch...

01:32.109 --> 01:34.159
It's still not an excuse
not to get your work done.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.111
We've got two deck crew members
up before any girls.

01:36.146 --> 01:37.780
It's weird.

01:37.815 --> 01:39.698
I'm not gonna get into
an argument with this.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.850
Yeah, because you're defending
yourself... I'm not arguing.

01:41.886 --> 01:44.887
It is so peaceful right now.

01:44.922 --> 01:46.655
I'll make sure the girls are
up at whatever time you want.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.190
-Perfect.
-You tell me.

01:48.225 --> 01:49.892
That's the problem, because
this is your department.

01:49.927 --> 01:52.594
So, if you... As long as
you can do that, I'm happy.

01:52.630 --> 01:54.530
We're just... I don't
want that to happen again.

01:54.565 --> 01:55.714
-Okay, gary...
-Again...

01:55.766 --> 01:57.833
Walk off... Walk off
on me, yeah.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.506
[bleep] me, if you're gonna
have a ----ing go at me,

02:04.542 --> 02:06.608
then I'm gonna be defensive.

02:06.644 --> 02:07.609
Ugh.

02:07.645 --> 02:08.694
[bleep]

02:11.198 --> 02:13.899
ah!
Hey, jim.

02:13.951 --> 02:15.450
Ah!

02:17.872 --> 02:20.122
All I wanna say is she
made two coffees for jim.

02:20.157 --> 02:21.256
She made two coffees and one...

02:21.292 --> 02:22.858
One guest was up
before you were.

02:22.877 --> 02:24.526
Yeah.

02:24.562 --> 02:27.162
He made it sound like six guests
and 15 of their friends.

02:30.668 --> 02:32.000
Manage your time better,

02:32.035 --> 02:33.669
you have the same amount
of people as we do,

02:33.704 --> 02:37.172
and we have a way bigger
interior than you do a deck.

02:37.208 --> 02:39.074
Good morning, colin.

02:39.109 --> 02:40.909
Everybody needs to quit
their bitching.

02:40.945 --> 02:42.728
If you need to find someone
to get a coffee, go find them.

02:42.763 --> 02:46.114
It's a 56-meter boat, not
the ----ing size of ireland.

02:46.150 --> 02:48.066
Yuck.

02:48.102 --> 02:50.719
I feel like yesterday was
the day we drank the most.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.187
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

02:53.858 --> 02:55.123
-Good morning.
-How are you?

02:55.159 --> 02:56.942
Can I get you
a coffee or anything?

02:56.994 --> 02:58.076
What do you have for hangovers?

02:58.112 --> 02:59.111
-Bloody mary?
-Yes, please.

02:59.163 --> 03:00.596
Sure.

03:00.631 --> 03:02.030
-Do you mind giving me a hand?
-Yeah.

03:02.066 --> 03:05.117
Okay, chef, they want
breakfast around 8:45-ish.

03:05.169 --> 03:08.670
I know you already
made a couple things.

03:08.706 --> 03:10.255
Is that enough time?

03:10.291 --> 03:11.590
-What?
-Is that enough time?

03:11.625 --> 03:12.908
Yeah.

03:12.927 --> 03:14.776
Yeah? Okay.

03:14.812 --> 03:16.044
I know.

03:16.079 --> 03:17.512
Oh, look at that, god love her.

03:20.684 --> 03:21.717
She's fuming.

03:21.752 --> 03:22.935
Is she?

03:22.970 --> 03:24.052
Yeah, because
I just walked away,

03:24.088 --> 03:25.771
because I couldn't handle it.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.105
I'm like, "let's try
and find a solution."

03:27.141 --> 03:28.590
she's like, "here's
your solution."

03:28.609 --> 03:29.591
I'm like, "okay,
but this is your staff,

03:29.610 --> 03:30.642
can we try and get them up?"

03:30.694 --> 03:31.944
we're two people out on deck.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.061
We work 24 hours,
around the clock.

03:33.096 --> 03:34.062
I don't get eight hours' sleep.

03:34.098 --> 03:35.063
She's very defensive.

03:35.098 --> 03:36.698
Whew, I don't know.

03:38.202 --> 03:40.953
-Oh, water, for sure for me.
-Yep.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.371
-You want me to take these?
-Yep.

03:42.406 --> 03:44.740
Avocado toast,
grapefruit, jalapenos.

03:44.775 --> 03:45.741
Oh, wow.

03:47.945 --> 03:49.077
Yeah, I know.

03:50.214 --> 03:51.647
See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya.

03:51.682 --> 03:54.316
So, here we have smashed
avocado toast

03:54.351 --> 03:56.001
with grapefruit and jalapenos.

03:56.053 --> 03:57.119
All right.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.687
Ah, lovely.

03:58.722 --> 04:01.823
Egg muffins with spinach
and goat's cheese.

04:01.859 --> 04:03.859
Whew... Why are you and
I so shaky today?

04:03.894 --> 04:06.361
-I'm like, uh...
-It's like...

04:06.397 --> 04:08.096
-Colin, glenn.
<i> -Yeah, go ahead.</i>

04:08.131 --> 04:10.182
<i> Let's fire up and start</i>
<i> picking up immediately.</i>

04:10.234 --> 04:11.183
Okay, copy that.

04:13.637 --> 04:15.270
<i> Okay, glenn, we're off the</i>
<i> bottom, we're off the bottom.</i>

04:15.305 --> 04:16.405
Copy that.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.106
We're just about done eating.

04:18.142 --> 04:19.975
Hi miss marni,
look how pretty you are.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.410
You're so nice.

04:21.445 --> 04:23.045
Definitely we're gonna
keep this rhythm.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.981
Yeah, it just gets
easier and easier.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.716
<i> Anchor's home, anchor is home.</i>

04:27.751 --> 04:29.584
Copy, anchor home, thank you.

04:30.754 --> 04:32.354
<i> Gary, gary, glenn.</i>

04:32.389 --> 04:34.222
<i> Dude, it looks like we could</i>
<i> get some bad weather</i>

04:34.258 --> 04:36.258
while we're docked
so before we arrive

04:36.293 --> 04:38.343
we wanna blow up those
new fenders, yeah?

04:38.379 --> 04:40.796
When it comes to
unpredictable weather

04:40.831 --> 04:44.883
and wind and docks,
I've learned the hard way.

04:44.935 --> 04:46.401
Ahead, ahead, ahead!

04:46.437 --> 04:47.386
Sh--, I'm going ahead,
and I've lost it.

04:47.438 --> 04:50.939
Ahead, ahead!

04:50.975 --> 04:53.775
Goddamn it!
[bleep]

04:53.811 --> 04:56.028
we have a very delicate,
expensive paint job,

04:56.063 --> 04:57.412
and we've got a storm coming.

04:57.448 --> 04:59.915
So, if it's blowing
you onto the dock,

04:59.950 --> 05:01.733
you need extra protection.

05:01.785 --> 05:03.752
So, these new fenders are
bigger than the ----ing dock.

05:03.787 --> 05:06.538
[bleep]
they're gonna be massive.

05:06.573 --> 05:07.756
Are you guys all finished?

05:07.791 --> 05:09.291
Can we get you anything else?

05:09.326 --> 05:10.742
You're all done?

05:10.794 --> 05:12.094
We are so done,
thank you so much.

05:12.129 --> 05:14.963
-I'm gonna go pack.
-Ugh!

05:14.999 --> 05:16.431
Hey, how's it going?

05:16.467 --> 05:18.667
-Done.
-Thanks.

05:18.702 --> 05:20.052
Oh, my lord.

05:20.087 --> 05:24.006
Is it already over?
Is it already over?

05:24.041 --> 05:25.340
-Do you need a tissue?
-I'm not leaving.

05:25.375 --> 05:26.908
Okay, so that's one down.

05:26.944 --> 05:28.010
Yeah, three to go.

05:31.815 --> 05:33.398
Yeah, I know. [bleep] me.

05:33.434 --> 05:36.568
<i> Gabriela or ashley,</i>
<i> do you mind</i>

05:36.603 --> 05:38.103
<i> giving me a hand</i>
<i> with the fenders?</i>

05:38.155 --> 05:39.321
<i> Copy that, gary.</i>

05:44.611 --> 05:47.262
Oh, my gosh,
it's the size of a house.

05:47.297 --> 05:48.947
Okay, so can you manage
to carry one of these?

05:48.999 --> 05:50.966
Yeah, I got it.

05:51.001 --> 05:52.934
Starboard side, we'll have two
on the stern, two on the bow.

05:52.970 --> 05:54.336
Can you manage this, ash?

05:54.371 --> 05:55.470
Are you sure?
This one's quite heavy, eh?

05:55.506 --> 05:56.938
Yeah.

05:56.974 --> 05:58.106
Can you put it through
the fairlead

05:58.142 --> 05:59.107
and get it ready,
do you know how?

05:59.143 --> 06:00.759
Sure!

06:00.794 --> 06:03.045
That was a few days ago,
my troubles seemed so far away.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.813
----Ing hell.

06:04.848 --> 06:06.214
So, that's the aft-leading
spring line, right?

06:06.250 --> 06:07.449
For... Yeah, aft-leading
spring, correct?

06:07.484 --> 06:10.268
Gary said put it
through the something...

06:10.304 --> 06:11.803
The fairlead, the...

06:11.855 --> 06:12.804
-The thing on the back.
-The hole in the boat?

06:12.856 --> 06:14.189
Yeah.

06:14.224 --> 06:15.190
When you tie that,
don't tie it over the...

06:15.225 --> 06:17.092
I'm trying to tie it--

06:17.127 --> 06:18.960
no, no, no, tie it clovered,
but don't ever tie it here,

06:18.996 --> 06:20.195
because when this goes on the
bollard it pulls like that...

06:20.230 --> 06:21.196
And then you
can't get that off.

06:21.231 --> 06:23.031
So, you can just tie it up here.

06:23.067 --> 06:26.485
You know, we lost someone on the
deck team, god rest his soul.

06:26.537 --> 06:28.320
Just kidding, he didn't die,
he's okay.

06:28.372 --> 06:31.373
But I've been a deckhand,
I've been a deck stew,

06:31.408 --> 06:33.125
so it's like,
help me help you.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.211
<i> Glenn, glenn, do you want</i>
<i> the stern to end up</i>

06:36.246 --> 06:38.280
where that wall is,
next to the white car?

06:38.315 --> 06:39.514
<i> Yeah.</i>

06:39.550 --> 06:41.016
How's it going,
you get any sleep?

06:41.051 --> 06:42.451
Yeah.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.019
As soon as we dock,
you can go back to bed.

06:44.054 --> 06:45.454
All good, all good.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.789
You guys can start setting
up all your fenders.

06:47.825 --> 06:50.325
These are going
on top of our fenders.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.860
-So, those big, grey fenders...
-Got it...

06:51.895 --> 06:53.328
Wanna be in-between,
pretty much.

06:53.363 --> 06:55.197
I think that's gonna be
our stern line there,

06:55.232 --> 06:57.099
so I'm gonna come ahead a bit.

06:57.134 --> 06:58.934
Okay, I'm ready.

06:58.969 --> 07:00.485
We're gonna come straight
alongside from where we are now.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.237
Get the big ones over the side.

07:02.272 --> 07:04.406
Okay, one, two, three, push.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.409
-Pushing...
-Yeah, I thought so.

07:07.444 --> 07:08.910
-Look at this.
-That's too short.

07:08.946 --> 07:10.862
-Yeah.
-Well, that's not gonna work.

07:10.914 --> 07:12.681
It's gonna have to go on
the lower lifeline,

07:12.716 --> 07:13.982
and even that's probably
gonna be too high.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.500
Gary, we need longer lines.

07:15.536 --> 07:18.053
Yeah, I don't have longer lines.

07:18.088 --> 07:19.054
Sh--'s heavy as [bleep].

07:19.089 --> 07:20.689
Join a couple.

07:20.724 --> 07:22.007
Know what we can do,
let's just tie this bowline

07:22.042 --> 07:23.041
onto one of these paddars.

07:23.093 --> 07:24.209
Onto what?

07:24.261 --> 07:26.044
Just tie the bowline onto one.

07:26.096 --> 07:27.546
If it rips, it rips.

07:27.598 --> 07:28.547
-Okay.
-Yeah, I got it.

07:28.599 --> 07:30.215
Yeah, this is something

07:30.267 --> 07:32.534
you don't wanna screw up,
$40 million boat.

07:32.569 --> 07:36.171
-Okay, I'm ready.
-Yeah, let's go.

07:36.190 --> 07:38.306
These have to be dropped
in the water.

07:38.341 --> 07:40.375
So do the other ones.
Drop this ----ing...

07:40.410 --> 07:41.376
It's just gonna make it.

07:41.411 --> 07:42.377
Is it touching the water?

07:42.412 --> 07:43.528
Yep.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.882
Okay, it's coming on us.

07:46.917 --> 07:48.450
----Ing...

07:50.287 --> 07:52.254
Here, gimme that line,
I'll tie it.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.025
Ashley, are you
calling distance?

07:57.060 --> 07:59.261
I can; it's not gonna
be in meters.

07:59.296 --> 08:01.830
Just hold the end, right
on the end of the black line,

08:01.865 --> 08:03.465
and drop it in the water.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.417
We should have talked
about this beforehand.

08:05.469 --> 08:08.136
Gimme distance ahead till I'm
overlapped on the yellow cat.

08:10.073 --> 08:12.207
-Oh, I don't think so.
-No, I don't think so either.

08:12.226 --> 08:13.308
Can you help me throw this over?

08:13.343 --> 08:15.010
This fender as well?

08:15.045 --> 08:16.211
One more little fender,
I don't know where it is.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.429
-You got it?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa...

08:17.481 --> 08:18.446
Marcos, keep your
hand on the line.

08:18.482 --> 08:20.015
I got the line.

08:20.050 --> 08:21.016
Otherwise it's gonna
be too heavy.

08:21.051 --> 08:22.017
Hold the end of the black line.

08:22.052 --> 08:23.051
You guys ready or what?

08:23.070 --> 08:24.069
[bleep] me.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.437
Holy cow.

08:25.489 --> 08:27.122
This is making us look
like ----ing idiots.

08:30.893 --> 08:32.627
Drop it in the water.

08:33.430 --> 08:34.045
<i> We're pretty much lined up now.</i>

08:34.765 --> 08:35.430
You guys ready or what?

08:35.465 --> 08:36.598
I think we're good, glenn.

08:39.670 --> 08:42.003
Okay, here we go.

08:42.039 --> 08:43.505
Forward running spring on.

08:45.375 --> 08:46.841
Okay, let's get a stern line on,

08:46.860 --> 08:48.677
and then we can get
that aft-going spring on.

08:48.712 --> 08:51.363
All this to get
your bag off, babe.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.032
Excellent... All right,
I'm coming outta gear.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.203
Looks pretty good.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.687
These two are gonna take
all the pressure.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.623
-Nice job.
-Thanks.

09:01.658 --> 09:03.525
<i> All crew, all crew, can we get</i>
<i> everybody on the dock, please?</i>

09:03.560 --> 09:05.377
We really have to get off.

09:05.412 --> 09:08.246
I'm sad.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.381
Gary, you're fabulous.

09:09.416 --> 09:12.167
-Daisy.
-Oh, thank you so much.

09:12.202 --> 09:13.301
Thanks, you guys are amazing.

09:13.337 --> 09:15.203
Glenn, I'm tellin' ya.

09:15.239 --> 09:16.871
You guys were so much fun.

09:16.907 --> 09:19.707
I don't honestly know
what to tell you guys.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.710
The amount of fun, the amount of
effort, the amount of friendship

09:22.729 --> 09:26.615
that you guys delivered
on did not go unnoticed.

09:26.650 --> 09:30.068
Genuinely, from the bottom of
our hearts, thank you so much.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.270
I think we're...

09:32.322 --> 09:33.438
Thank you very much.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.073
Thank you so very much,
thank you.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.274
-Thank you so much.
-I love every one of you.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.275
-All right.
-So, thank you so much.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.726
-Love you guys!
-Bye!

09:38.745 --> 09:40.195
Thank you!

09:40.230 --> 09:41.529
[ship horn blows]

09:41.564 --> 09:42.530
woo!

09:45.786 --> 09:47.202
That was a good one.

09:47.237 --> 09:48.286
Okay, I'm gonna change.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.704
Okay, cool.

09:56.446 --> 09:58.413
My coochie can breathe.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.581
All crew, all crew,
can I get everybody together

10:00.601 --> 10:02.817
in the saloon for a tip meeting?

10:02.853 --> 10:05.303
I'm ready for
a shower and tequila.

10:07.691 --> 10:10.108
So, it goes without
saying this charter started off

10:10.143 --> 10:11.476
a little bit of a bad foot.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.629
We all had to say
goodbye to tom.

10:14.665 --> 10:16.197
I have a lot
of lives to consider.

10:16.233 --> 10:19.801
That incident put those
lives at risk, you know?

10:19.836 --> 10:23.788
So, that said, kelsie, I
especially wanted to thank you.

10:23.824 --> 10:27.709
I really felt confident in
your doing the anchor watch,

10:27.744 --> 10:29.628
and I slept better knowing
that you were there

10:29.663 --> 10:31.513
and you understood what
was needed, okay?

10:31.548 --> 10:34.449
Heck, yeah, I like
the positive reassurance.

10:34.468 --> 10:38.169
Tell me, tell...
Give me all the compliments.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.288
So, I am working on getting
another deckhand in.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.723
Obviously, we're a man down.

10:41.758 --> 10:43.642
Gary, do you have anything
else to add to that?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.510
Colin, thank you
for helping out.

10:45.562 --> 10:46.594
And girls also, thank
you for helping out today

10:46.629 --> 10:47.729
with fenders, et cetera.

10:47.764 --> 10:49.597
Until we have another deckhand,

10:49.632 --> 10:51.683
if you girls don't mind helping
out, because with these fenders,

10:51.735 --> 10:53.234
it's a bit of a sh---show.

10:53.270 --> 10:56.271
The tip total in u.S. Dollars
is 21,000.

10:56.306 --> 10:59.674
-Yes!
-Per person, it's 2,530.

10:59.710 --> 11:01.976
Woohoo!

11:01.995 --> 11:03.828
Excuse me?

11:03.864 --> 11:06.281
Obviously, there are only
eight of us here right now,

11:06.316 --> 11:08.450
and there's obviously
a ninth share.

11:08.485 --> 11:10.785
I feel it's appropriate
we're gonna give tom

11:10.820 --> 11:12.537
a one-third share,

11:12.589 --> 11:14.172
and then we're gonna split
the rest amongst you guys.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.357
That's another couple
hundred bucks each.

11:15.392 --> 11:16.891
-Yeah!
-Yes!

11:16.927 --> 11:19.194
Thank you very much, kids.

11:19.229 --> 11:21.363
How did the charter go?

11:21.398 --> 11:22.881
Great.
I felt like it was our best one.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.432
Yeah.

11:24.468 --> 11:26.301
I think that
we did better together.

11:26.336 --> 11:27.552
Together.

11:27.604 --> 11:28.669
Me and ashley
did well on service.

11:28.689 --> 11:29.670
-Dreamwork, teamwork?
-Yeah.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.439
Yeah?

11:31.475 --> 11:32.474
I don't know what happened
with you and marcos

11:32.509 --> 11:33.508
yesterday with the dinner.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.443
Oh, just verbage.

11:35.479 --> 11:36.695
But just...
It doesn't really matter.

11:36.730 --> 11:37.696
-But just for yourself...
-To be clearer.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.214
Clear, yeah.

11:39.249 --> 11:40.548
And if you see him
kinda dawdling, being...

11:40.584 --> 11:41.549
You know, being like,
"did you hear me?"

11:41.585 --> 11:43.351
right.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.852
I don't... Wasn't there,
so I don't know who...

11:44.871 --> 11:46.521
It's just... It was just a
miscommunication.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.522
I think... We discussed it,
and he's like,

11:47.541 --> 11:48.689
next time, just say "fire."

11:48.709 --> 11:50.358
-yeah.
-How is that my fault?

11:50.394 --> 11:51.359
I was giving him a play-by-play
of what was going on.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.627
Yeah.

11:52.662 --> 11:54.496
That didn't tell him to
fire, so...

11:54.531 --> 11:55.830
Like, I come in quite like,
"right, we're ready to go."

11:55.865 --> 11:56.831
-like, ready. Yeah.
-Yeah... See, yeah.

11:56.866 --> 11:58.466
I didn't do that.

11:58.502 --> 12:01.836
It's like a mind [bleep]
actually, but whatever.

12:01.871 --> 12:04.222
It's fine. It's fine.
Everything's fine.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.874
Let's call it a day down here.

12:05.909 --> 12:08.710
Just start at 10:00
tomorrow again, that's it.

12:08.745 --> 12:10.912
-[farts]
-oh, my god.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.481
You're a ----ing dick.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.657
Oh, my goodness, I feel
like you're going to prom

12:22.692 --> 12:23.958
and you're my daughter
right now.

12:30.867 --> 12:32.867
Gary's got bad gas today.

12:32.903 --> 12:34.335
Eww, was that the smell
in your cabin?

12:34.371 --> 12:37.672
-Oh, yeah.
-It was disgusting.

12:37.707 --> 12:40.408
We're gonna take him to the vet
tomorrow, get him sorted out.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.743
Maybe you can
help him with that.

12:41.778 --> 12:43.311
I'm okay.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.462
You love the massages...
You like the massages.

12:44.514 --> 12:45.930
That's your... That's your job!

12:45.966 --> 12:47.382
Oh, my god, are you girls gonna
fight over gary tonight?

12:47.417 --> 12:48.983
-No.
-No.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.751
One of you take him down
and just be done with it.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.455
Paper, scissors,
rock, right now. Go.

12:53.490 --> 12:54.856
Hi, friends.

12:54.891 --> 12:56.291
You took 45 minutes
and you're wearing that?

12:57.627 --> 13:00.645
Hello, gorgeous,
you look so good tonight.

13:02.332 --> 13:03.998
Gary, good to go? Vamanos.

13:05.402 --> 13:06.901
Yes, boys!

13:06.937 --> 13:09.404
-We don't need you.
-Back seat bandits.

13:09.439 --> 13:12.957
Here's to a ----ing awesome
night, bitches!

13:12.993 --> 13:14.609
Yeah.

13:14.628 --> 13:15.610
Who do you think the girls
are talking about?

13:15.629 --> 13:17.078
Me.

13:17.113 --> 13:18.913
What would they all be like
in bed?

13:18.948 --> 13:21.916
I know gary would be shy,
because he doesn't listen.

13:21.952 --> 13:23.818
Colin probably listens
too much, he'd be worried...

13:23.854 --> 13:25.954
-I think gary...
-He'd be like, "are you okay?"

13:25.989 --> 13:28.323
marcos would probably
start crying, so...

13:28.358 --> 13:31.059
Ah!

13:31.094 --> 13:32.627
Guilty, I've done
that a couple times.

13:32.646 --> 13:33.761
Ah!

13:33.797 --> 13:34.929
That's exactly how it went.

13:34.965 --> 13:36.631
We are there!
[bleep] yeah.

13:38.635 --> 13:41.769
Oh, this is amazing!

13:41.805 --> 13:43.571
This is so pretty.

13:43.607 --> 13:45.406
How romantic!

13:45.442 --> 13:46.407
This is just too pretty.

13:46.443 --> 13:48.476
So beautiful, bro.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.661
-Hi.
-Como esta, is everything okay?

13:49.696 --> 13:50.678
Si!

13:50.714 --> 13:52.146
Then ready for drinks?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.781
-Yes.
-Okay.

13:53.816 --> 13:55.650
Guys, I'm gonna take
one video of all of us.

13:55.685 --> 13:56.818
-Okay.
-What's up?

13:56.853 --> 13:58.953
Woohoo!

14:02.692 --> 14:04.008
Sometimes I don't hear.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.994
I know, I know... Oh, I know.

14:06.029 --> 14:07.762
After last night, I know.

14:07.797 --> 14:08.847
It was only one time,
now we know.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.131
You gotta say "fire."

14:10.166 --> 14:11.766
are you ready
to order something?

14:11.801 --> 14:12.767
Si, por favor.

14:12.802 --> 14:14.802
Can I get the spaghettoni?

14:14.837 --> 14:16.671
Can I please have the ravioli?

14:16.706 --> 14:18.806
Okay, could I get the
black squid taglioni?

14:18.841 --> 14:22.477
Can we have wine,
please, buckets of it?

14:22.512 --> 14:24.012
That's our girl!

14:24.047 --> 14:25.513
Okay, okay, I'm gonna say
one thing for real...

14:25.549 --> 14:27.148
We put the bar very, very high.

14:27.183 --> 14:29.033
Now it's gonna be
a difficult job

14:29.069 --> 14:31.069
to maintain it or put it higher.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.688
I feel like we just need to vibe
so hard that the guests

14:33.723 --> 14:36.858
have no option than to
vibe as hard as us, you know?

14:36.893 --> 14:40.128
In my case, in my... As marcos,
I like to put it higher.

14:41.698 --> 14:43.131
I don't like to be
on the same level.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.415
That's one of the things I'm...

14:44.467 --> 14:45.900
Complacency sucks.

14:45.936 --> 14:47.001
...I'm gonna do, I'm gonna
try to work

14:47.037 --> 14:48.636
with all you guys as a team,

14:48.672 --> 14:50.371
and it's gonna be
the best season ever.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.007
Yeah, I agree.
Cheers to that.

14:53.043 --> 14:54.041
-To marcos!
-They're gonna remember that.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.543
-To the best...
-To marcos.

14:55.579 --> 14:56.711
They're gonna
remember us forever.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.212
-To the best season.
-Okay.

14:58.248 --> 14:59.847
Wow, this looks incredible.

14:59.883 --> 15:01.849
You can't have a good
view without good food.

15:01.884 --> 15:03.051
It's amazing pasta, bro.

15:03.086 --> 15:04.218
Ooh, wow.

15:04.254 --> 15:05.920
The octopus looks good.

15:05.956 --> 15:07.655
You can have some if
you don't piss me off.

15:07.691 --> 15:09.157
Don't be so defensive
with your whole life.

15:11.027 --> 15:12.060
Oh, she's my biggest fan.

15:12.095 --> 15:13.628
Yeah, that's clear.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.699
Oh, you're so sweet.

15:17.734 --> 15:19.000
Of course.

15:19.035 --> 15:20.702
I'm perfect towards her.

15:20.737 --> 15:22.704
That's what happens when
you don't piss me off.

15:22.739 --> 15:24.172
I wish I was better
at sucking [bleep].

15:24.207 --> 15:26.107
Well, we can practice.
I mean, by all means.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.676
You're both perfect.

15:28.712 --> 15:30.428
Excuse me from the table.

15:31.681 --> 15:32.981
No. Yeah, okay, let's go.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.816
Come, dais.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.718
I'm not laughing at you
until you apologize.

15:36.753 --> 15:38.436
You don't have to laugh at me.
What am I apologizing for?

15:38.471 --> 15:40.655
Okay, well, you don't have
to apologize, but we...

15:40.690 --> 15:42.190
-Okay.
-...Need to at least...

15:42.225 --> 15:43.641
-Are you gonna get defensive?
-Can you let me speak?

15:43.693 --> 15:45.193
Mm-hmm.

15:45.228 --> 15:46.594
I shouldn't have been so
defensive, but I felt attacked.

15:46.630 --> 15:48.896
So, I apologize
for being defensive.

15:48.932 --> 15:51.065
What I want is for us to
be happy with each other.

15:51.100 --> 15:54.068
So, if you need our help,
all you have to say is

15:54.104 --> 15:55.603
"can I have your help."

15:55.622 --> 15:57.005
no, for sure, I know.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.773
And that's what
the bottom line was,

15:58.792 --> 16:00.208
and that's what I was trying
to get to this morning.

16:00.243 --> 16:01.793
With all the issues that
I've had with daisy,

16:01.828 --> 16:04.245
I can still very easily
snap out of it.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.946
Can I win them?
Yeah, I sure can.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.799
But do I wanna
win them against daisy?

16:07.834 --> 16:09.717
No, because it's just gonna
create more and more problems.

16:11.671 --> 16:12.787
I have to poop.
Can we go home now?

16:12.822 --> 16:14.955
[speaking italian]

16:14.975 --> 16:16.474
I don't speak italian.

16:16.509 --> 16:17.892
Okay, what do you
want me to speak?

16:20.697 --> 16:21.929
Portuguese, portuguese.

16:21.965 --> 16:23.498
What we gonna do tonight, damn?

16:23.533 --> 16:25.099
Oh, how come you listen
to him and not to me?

16:25.134 --> 16:26.985
You were looking at me,
asking me what language

16:27.020 --> 16:29.437
I wanted you to speak,
and I said portuguese.

16:32.676 --> 16:33.975
Gary!

16:34.010 --> 16:35.493
How many times have
you been in love?

16:35.528 --> 16:36.944
Many times.

16:36.979 --> 16:39.647
At that point that
I don't trust anybody.

16:39.683 --> 16:40.832
So, for me to be...

16:40.867 --> 16:42.166
Back to him.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.986
For me to be in this circle...

16:45.021 --> 16:46.838
We're so lucky.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.989
Yeah, we are.
No, keep going, we are lucky.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.675
You know, you're
being sarcastic,

16:50.710 --> 16:52.660
which is a ----ing idiot,
so you'd better stop it.

16:52.696 --> 16:53.878
No, I'm not being an idiot.
I'm just, like, you're...

16:53.930 --> 16:55.630
Yeah, you know what [bleep] off.

16:55.665 --> 16:57.532
I'm not gonna share what
I'm gonna share right now.

16:57.567 --> 16:59.734
Look, you're a very
insightful person,

16:59.769 --> 17:03.003
but sometimes you make
a lot of things about you,

17:03.023 --> 17:04.004
and it's okay for me
to say that.

17:04.024 --> 17:06.107
It's not about me.

17:06.142 --> 17:07.108
You know, I'm free to speech
whatever the [bleep] I want.

17:07.143 --> 17:08.209
I know you are.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.028
Well, you should
let people talk.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.562
I know. So should you.

17:11.614 --> 17:12.980
You don't let me, so.

17:13.015 --> 17:15.233
Gabi's ----ing pushing
my buttons.

17:15.285 --> 17:18.686
I don't know, maybe she's right;
maybe I do talk about myself.

17:18.705 --> 17:22.189
But that doesn't mean
that she has to offend me.

17:22.208 --> 17:26.210
Disrespect for me,
it's a no-no.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.228
You do the same thing
every time you drink.

17:27.263 --> 17:28.963
I'm not.

17:28.998 --> 17:30.264
Tomorrow, you're gonna think
about it, what you said.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.766
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are, man.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.067
Okay, cool, cool.

17:33.103 --> 17:34.969
So, anyways,
I've never been in love

17:35.004 --> 17:37.255
because I don't open
up enough for them to...

17:37.307 --> 17:38.339
To actually love them.

17:38.374 --> 17:42.643
Anyways, now moving on,

17:42.679 --> 17:45.229
gabriela, burnt orange
is your color.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.748
Look, I don't wanna
fight with you.

17:46.783 --> 17:48.716
I just wanted to hear

17:48.735 --> 17:50.568
what she had to say for a
second, that's it.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.986
It's not personal.

17:52.021 --> 17:53.821
But when you say
"you're drinking too much,

17:53.857 --> 17:54.922
and you're not... You're gonna
apologize tomorrow,"

17:54.958 --> 17:56.324
that's personal.

17:56.359 --> 17:58.092
All right, I'll stay away
from you then.

17:58.128 --> 17:59.777
Wow, okay, fine.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.195
You win.

18:01.230 --> 18:02.864
But you didn't say sorry.

18:02.899 --> 18:04.198
Do I have to say sorry?

18:04.233 --> 18:06.084
You probably should.
That was really mean.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.668
If we're friends,

18:07.704 --> 18:09.303
you probably should say
sorry for saying that.

18:09.339 --> 18:10.788
You told me...

18:10.840 --> 18:12.039
But if you don't
think you should...

18:12.074 --> 18:13.257
You told me that
I don't know you.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.258
-Well...
-And now you call me friends?

18:14.294 --> 18:15.927
All right.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.411
Don't worry,
I'll apologize to you tomorrow.

18:17.447 --> 18:20.247
Bro, I don't have time
for bullsh-- bro.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.749
I don't have time for drama.

18:21.785 --> 18:23.718
-Gabs!
-[bleep] this.

18:27.506 --> 18:30.658
Don't worry,
I'll apologize to you tomorrow.

18:31.661 --> 18:32.326
I don't think
so you're gonna do that.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.762
When I was in my early '20s,

18:34.798 --> 18:38.516
I literally would just tell you
to suck my [bleep], [bleep] off,

18:38.551 --> 18:39.534
maybe quit a job.

18:39.569 --> 18:40.551
Gabs!

18:40.603 --> 18:43.337
I'm too old for this thing, bro.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.172
That was me 10 years ago.

18:45.191 --> 18:47.525
Me now, I'm more mature,

18:47.560 --> 18:51.562
and I know marcos is not
gonna ever admit fault.

18:53.399 --> 18:55.750
-Gabriela.
-What?

18:55.785 --> 18:59.186
Kelsie was trying
to actually speak,

18:59.205 --> 19:01.873
and marcos made it about him
and then he turned on me.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.791
Then we went into this
whole back-and-forth thing,

19:03.827 --> 19:05.409
and I just didn't wanna
be around it, that's it.

19:05.461 --> 19:07.795
I'm not gonna apologize
for asking him

19:07.831 --> 19:09.797
to pipe down when
kelsie's talking.

19:09.833 --> 19:11.499
What the [bleep]
have you guys been doing

19:11.534 --> 19:12.550
to make that chick run away?

19:12.585 --> 19:14.502
That was all marcos.

19:14.537 --> 19:15.703
Hey, they're talking about me,
that I'm being ----ing rude

19:15.722 --> 19:18.539
and ----ing
sarcastic or whatever.

19:18.558 --> 19:21.375
I feel bad, because gabriela
was sticking up for me.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.880
Okay. Let's go.

19:29.752 --> 19:31.452
Come on, husband.

19:31.487 --> 19:33.120
[laughing]

19:43.499 --> 19:44.665
I think that's
what they're doing.

19:44.701 --> 19:46.200
[beatboxing]

19:48.171 --> 19:50.171
they're jiggling
ashley's tits right now.

19:50.206 --> 19:51.572
No, gary.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.673
[beatboxing]

19:52.709 --> 19:53.908
stop.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.676
To marcos' beatboxes?

19:55.712 --> 19:57.428
[laughing]

19:57.463 --> 19:58.596
stop.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.131
We sound good.

20:00.183 --> 20:01.265
[beatboxing]

20:05.555 --> 20:06.921
I'm not.

20:06.940 --> 20:08.139
Okay, come here.

20:11.561 --> 20:13.294
Okay, guys, I'm out. Later.

20:13.329 --> 20:14.946
It was nice talking.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.798
Over here by myself.

20:17.834 --> 20:18.833
Nighty-night.

20:22.705 --> 20:25.273
I'm gonna put my ----ing
bathing suit on now.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.474
Bye!

20:30.830 --> 20:33.414
Are you staying in bed?

20:33.449 --> 20:35.182
Okay, good night.

20:35.218 --> 20:37.451
I'm never the first person
to leave the party, ever.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.220
But having been a man down,

20:39.255 --> 20:40.638
all I wanna do is
catch up on some sleep.

20:44.510 --> 20:47.478
Oh, that's good, thank you.

20:47.513 --> 20:49.313
[laughing]

20:49.349 --> 20:51.599
oh, my god... Oh, my...

20:56.239 --> 20:57.488
I love bedtime!

21:00.677 --> 21:01.809
There's nothing in there.

21:04.914 --> 21:06.514
[chattering]

21:13.623 --> 21:18.843
ah! He's in the hot tub!

21:18.878 --> 21:21.929
Hey, hey, hey!

21:21.965 --> 21:23.597
[shouting]

21:23.633 --> 21:25.850
[snoring]

21:25.885 --> 21:27.401
do we wanna drain it?

21:32.976 --> 21:34.475
[laughing]

21:38.364 --> 21:41.382
these are not allowed.

21:41.417 --> 21:42.700
-I'm calling it.
-Hey, hey, hey!

21:42.735 --> 21:44.402
It's time for bed.

21:46.289 --> 21:47.788
[laughing]

21:49.425 --> 21:50.958
this is gary's shirt.

21:50.994 --> 21:52.460
Does somebody wanna ----ing
bring it to him?

21:57.700 --> 21:58.933
[singing]

21:58.968 --> 22:00.334
ow, my nipples!

22:01.671 --> 22:03.754
-Mm?
-Mm.

22:03.806 --> 22:05.406
Yeah.

22:12.815 --> 22:14.565
Oh!

22:14.600 --> 22:16.734
Oh [bleep].

22:23.993 --> 22:26.277
Uh, you're in my ----ing room,
so shut up.

22:26.329 --> 22:27.828
Wake me up at 6:00.

22:35.271 --> 22:38.105
-No, don't...
-Why is she in my bed?

22:42.078 --> 22:45.079
Hey!

22:45.098 --> 22:47.715
Boom... This is exactly what
I was talking about.

22:47.750 --> 22:49.433
Gabriela's a ----ing snake,

22:49.469 --> 22:52.436
and if gary wants to hook up
with gabriela, fine,

22:52.472 --> 22:55.022
but I'm not gonna ----ing hook
up with you in this van

22:55.058 --> 22:56.524
and then have you
go hook up with her

22:56.559 --> 22:57.808
when we get back to the boat.

23:06.402 --> 23:07.485
No, I'm saying that...

23:22.652 --> 23:23.651
You're jealous.

23:23.686 --> 23:24.652
But I ----ing... Oh, my god.

23:24.687 --> 23:25.653
That's the problem.

23:25.688 --> 23:27.488
[bleep]
bed.

23:27.523 --> 23:28.639
-Stop.
-Bed. Sh--.

23:28.674 --> 23:29.890
I don't ----ing need it.

23:29.926 --> 23:31.125
Hey, you're jealous...

23:31.144 --> 23:32.793
I don't need it,
I don't want it.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.061
I'm not jealous,
I don't ----ing need it.

23:34.097 --> 23:36.147
I didn't even know
she got up.

23:36.182 --> 23:39.483
Gary, while you create
a ----ing sh---show

23:39.519 --> 23:40.484
for the rest of us
to deal with...

23:40.520 --> 23:42.103
He did not, he did not.

23:42.138 --> 23:44.638
I just wanna know what time
your deckhand has to be up.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.824
-Ten o'clock.
-Thank you.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.742
I have to work with her in the
----ing interior,

23:48.778 --> 23:50.161
what do you ----ing
want from me?

23:50.196 --> 23:51.996
I didn't ----ing do any of this.

23:52.031 --> 23:55.116
I... Like, I don't
want any part of this.

23:55.151 --> 23:56.667
Ashley, bed.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.519
-This is me calling bed.
-I'm going to bed.

23:58.554 --> 24:00.721
-I know, I'm going to bed.
-Bed!

24:04.927 --> 24:07.761
I'm going to bed,
I'm going to bed.

24:07.797 --> 24:09.630
I'm ----ing over it.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.682
My night is constantly
being surrounded

24:11.717 --> 24:14.685
by idiots that
I have to put in line.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.388
I'll own up to my ----ing
bullsh-- but

24:17.440 --> 24:19.640
it's not ----ing me.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.542
[bleep].

24:29.284 --> 24:31.118
[bleep]

24:42.064 --> 24:42.897
ow!

24:45.735 --> 24:48.068
Are you okay?

24:54.110 --> 24:55.576
I don't even know what...

24:57.663 --> 24:58.879
You're okay.

25:01.951 --> 25:04.134
I'm fine, I'm fine.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.003
It's fine.

25:06.055 --> 25:07.788
Oh, god.

25:07.807 --> 25:10.024
What happened, did she literally
just fall out of her bunk?

25:10.059 --> 25:11.926
-Yeah.
-Damn.

25:40.006 --> 25:43.524
I do not remember how I fell.

25:43.559 --> 25:46.794
All I remember is gabriela
sleeping in gary's bed,

25:46.829 --> 25:51.015
and you know what, this is why
I have major trust issues.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.033
I haven't spoken to my
sister in, like, a year.

25:53.069 --> 25:55.052
Like, she screwed every guy
I ever liked in high school.

25:55.104 --> 25:56.637
Really?

25:56.672 --> 25:59.006
She knew... Yeah,
and she knew I liked them.

25:59.025 --> 26:03.143
It's just rude and gross
and, like, disrespectful.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.519
Yeah, I don't feel too bad.

26:12.538 --> 26:14.204
[bleep] I woke up and
gabriela was in my bed.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.206
Bro...

26:21.697 --> 26:23.230
And we were singing and
they were hooking up

26:23.266 --> 26:24.999
in the back of the
car, remember?

26:30.673 --> 26:31.805
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:31.841 --> 26:32.806
How's your head?

26:32.842 --> 26:34.207
It ----ing hurts.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.176
-I don't even--
-where's gabriela?

26:36.211 --> 26:37.678
[bleep]'s sake.

26:37.713 --> 26:38.979
I wasn't even
gonna say anything.

26:40.249 --> 26:42.583
-Yeah?
-Up, come on.

26:45.288 --> 26:48.155
Gabriela, you can't
be late for work.

26:48.190 --> 26:49.690
Oh.

26:53.863 --> 26:56.664
Ooh, ooh, ooh, toe cramp,
toe cramp, toe cramp.

26:56.699 --> 26:57.665
What, what? Oh.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.800
Jeez, you scared me.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.251
Thanks for waking me
up this morning,

27:01.287 --> 27:02.953
that was really sweet of you.

27:03.005 --> 27:06.006
Sorry, I was cleaning
up the bar and stuff.

27:06.042 --> 27:08.075
No, but no, seriously,
thank you for waking me up.

27:08.094 --> 27:09.209
That was really nice.

27:09.245 --> 27:10.928
I'm sorry.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.763
Good, I'm glad you
got up on time.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.581
That's all that matters,

27:14.600 --> 27:16.600
is daisy knows that you were
up early, cleaning the bar.

27:16.636 --> 27:18.852
I hate that I'm making a
bad impression on people

27:18.888 --> 27:20.754
that I look up to,

27:20.773 --> 27:23.724
that have more experience than
me and are great at their jobs.

27:25.728 --> 27:28.228
I low-key wanna cry on the spot.

27:35.771 --> 27:37.237
I gotta get some air.

27:37.272 --> 27:38.839
Eww! Eww!

27:38.874 --> 27:40.808
-What is that?
-Oh, god!

27:40.843 --> 27:42.292
What happened?

27:42.328 --> 27:44.662
It looks like a chopped-up
penis, throw that out!

27:44.714 --> 27:46.914
That is disgusting!

27:48.634 --> 27:49.783
Eww!

27:49.802 --> 27:52.836
-How are you?
-Are you okay?

27:52.888 --> 27:54.722
I'm fine, yeah, and I didn't
ask gabriela to come

27:54.757 --> 27:55.956
into my bed, if that's
what you're worried about.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.725
-No, no...
-As soon as she's drunk,

27:57.760 --> 27:59.009
she likes to flirt with me,
and that's about it.

27:59.061 --> 28:00.894
Yeah, but that's, like,
I don't...

28:00.930 --> 28:02.730
I mean, I don't even think
I'm flirting with her too much.

28:02.765 --> 28:04.732
I don't think I was flirting
with you too much, either.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.734
Maybe we were touchy-touchy in
the taxi last night.

28:06.769 --> 28:09.636
-Did we hook up in the taxi?
-Yes!

28:09.672 --> 28:11.638
You came on to me last night.

28:11.657 --> 28:13.306
-Sorry about that.
-It's okay.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.908
It's fine, if you don't
remember you can just

28:14.944 --> 28:16.643
pretend it didn't happen.

28:16.662 --> 28:18.162
Oh, yeah, perfect...
Nothing happened last night.

28:21.250 --> 28:22.649
-Daisy?
-Mm-hmm.

28:22.668 --> 28:23.951
I'm sorry I woke up late.

28:23.986 --> 28:25.335
I'm not mad about that.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.037
I'm mad about
the straight liquor,

28:27.089 --> 28:28.038
I'm mad about things
going too far.

28:28.090 --> 28:29.923
Yeah.

28:29.959 --> 28:30.924
You can't get into gary's
bed when he's asleep.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.325
I know.

28:32.344 --> 28:33.927
Ashley can't be drinking
like that, either.

28:33.963 --> 28:35.345
It's not cool
that she fell out of bed.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.014
-I won't do that again...
-It's okay.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.065
-...With the gary thing.
-Just girls, tone it own.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.933
Take it back a notch.

28:39.969 --> 28:42.269
Someone's gonna get hurt or
someone's gonna get fired.

28:42.304 --> 28:43.887
I've never done
that before in my life.

28:43.939 --> 28:45.639
-Well, the...
-That was the...

28:45.674 --> 28:47.975
-I've done a lot of things...
-...First and last time.

28:48.010 --> 28:49.376
I don't drink like this
when I'm not here.

28:49.412 --> 28:50.894
-Okay, well, I would advise...
-Okay.

28:50.946 --> 28:54.314
...Not drinking like
this here either.

28:54.349 --> 28:57.050
Daisy, marcos,
and gary, can you guys...

28:57.086 --> 28:58.852
[bleep]

28:58.888 --> 29:00.954
...Meet me in the crew mess
for a preference sheet meeting?

29:00.990 --> 29:03.357
Beds are done. Can I help you
finish detailing up here?

29:03.392 --> 29:04.875
-Can I just...
-I can...

29:04.910 --> 29:06.126
-I'll detail it real quick...
-Okay.

29:06.162 --> 29:07.127
...And then I'll
do the stainless.

29:08.831 --> 29:10.214
Charter number five.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.249
-Ooh.
-Okay, primary charter guest.

29:12.301 --> 29:15.836
Dawn is a chicago-based
vegan foodie

29:15.871 --> 29:18.088
who enjoys nothing
more than eating

29:18.140 --> 29:19.807
in the finest restaurants.

29:19.842 --> 29:22.176
She has gathered her husband,
tim,

29:22.211 --> 29:24.945
and her closest travel
buddies, brian and marni,

29:24.980 --> 29:26.246
lauren and jamie.

29:26.282 --> 29:28.248
This group is expecting
to play with

29:28.284 --> 29:31.852
all the water toys and a
five-star dining experience.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.823
But you know, having
one is gonna be

29:35.858 --> 29:37.074
a little bit of a challenge.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.826
It's gonna be a bit
of a challenge,

29:38.861 --> 29:39.993
but I'm sure you'll be
fine with it, you know?

29:40.029 --> 29:41.328
-Yeah.
-Any news on the deckhand?

29:41.363 --> 29:44.131
He will be here very soon,

29:44.166 --> 29:47.000
but probably not until
we drop this one.

29:47.036 --> 29:48.401
Oh [bleep].

29:48.420 --> 29:49.736
We need a... Yeah,
we're gonna have to do

29:49.755 --> 29:51.171
what we did the last one.

29:51.207 --> 29:52.406
We'll ask colin to chip in,
I'll help.

29:52.441 --> 29:54.258
Yeah, I'll speak
to colin about it.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.210
You know, we're halfway there,
so we might be, like,

29:56.245 --> 29:58.045
slowing down a little bit,
but we need to find

29:58.080 --> 30:01.281
our second wind and push all
the way through to the end, eh?

30:01.317 --> 30:02.216
Were you getting some sleep?

30:04.419 --> 30:06.320
Okay, cool. Thank you very much.

30:06.355 --> 30:07.437
-All right, thank you.
-Thanks, glenn.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.089
Thank you.

30:09.108 --> 30:10.491
Ashley, real quick.

30:15.147 --> 30:18.198
I feel like I'm constantly
in trouble for something.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.900
This is what happens

30:19.935 --> 30:21.151
when I drink around people
that don't know me.

30:21.203 --> 30:22.870
-I don't trust you guys.
-Yeah.

30:22.905 --> 30:25.438
And it's an uncomfortable
way to live.

30:25.457 --> 30:28.075
Right now, my self-esteem
is in the gutter.

30:28.110 --> 30:31.078
I do get a lot of my self-worth

30:31.113 --> 30:32.913
from how good I am at my job,

30:32.948 --> 30:35.465
and I want daisy's respect.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.417
I think I'm just at a loss,

30:37.452 --> 30:39.887
because I know
that I'm ----ing up.

30:39.922 --> 30:41.454
Putting things away,
tidying the bar,

30:41.473 --> 30:43.056
that was just, like,
not important at all?

30:43.092 --> 30:45.225
-Whoa, whoa, whoa...
-I was doing other stuff.

30:45.261 --> 30:46.493
-Ready.
-Oh, yeah?

30:46.529 --> 30:48.345
I thought gabriela came
down and told you.

30:48.397 --> 30:49.396
Are you serious right now?

30:49.431 --> 30:51.481
Well, you should
let people talk.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.183
-You should...
-I know, so should you.

30:53.235 --> 30:56.303
To take all these blows,
I'm, like, imploding,

30:56.322 --> 30:58.472
and I'm so ----ing embarrassed.

30:58.507 --> 31:00.824
I seriously feel like
I don't wanna be here anymore.

31:02.945 --> 31:04.278
I don't wanna be here.

31:10.803 --> 31:12.102
I feel like I'm constantly
in trouble for something.

31:12.137 --> 31:14.137
I think it's just
a stress thing.

31:14.189 --> 31:15.806
I seriously feel like
I don't wanna be here anymore.

31:18.794 --> 31:20.277
I'm not good... I'm not good...

31:20.312 --> 31:21.795
I'm not good at being...
I'm good...

31:21.830 --> 31:24.398
I'm not good at this.
I'm not good at this.

31:24.433 --> 31:26.116
I... I'm gonna give you a hug,
and I don't know what to say.

31:26.151 --> 31:27.734
It's fine.

31:27.769 --> 31:29.236
I don't know what to say.
I'm not good at this.

31:32.374 --> 31:34.241
I think...

31:34.276 --> 31:37.611
...I... Obviously, I don't
know how you're feeling.

31:37.630 --> 31:39.613
Are you going to talk
to daisy about this?

31:39.648 --> 31:41.281
No.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.499
I won't say anything.

31:42.551 --> 31:44.284
Please don't say
anything to daisy.

31:44.303 --> 31:45.802
Let's go sit in the...
I won't say anything.

31:45.838 --> 31:46.887
Thanks for listening to me.

31:53.128 --> 31:55.312
Gar-bear, can you talk now?

31:55.347 --> 31:56.763
Talk, yeah.

31:56.798 --> 31:58.131
I'm just gonna have a cigarette.

32:01.403 --> 32:04.271
I only wanted to chat with
you to let you know that

32:04.306 --> 32:06.707
I really do like you, gary,
and I like our friendship,

32:06.742 --> 32:08.475
and I keep crawling
into your bed

32:08.494 --> 32:09.809
because I wanna
snuggle with you.

32:09.828 --> 32:11.445
I'm not mad,
I'm not angry at any...

32:11.480 --> 32:12.829
I know, but again,
I'm sorry about that.

32:12.865 --> 32:15.165
No, don't worry,
you don't have to be sorry.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.334
I really... I
really wanna ----ing make this

32:17.369 --> 32:18.502
all work with everybody.

32:18.537 --> 32:19.553
It is working, though, no?

32:19.588 --> 32:21.254
You and kelsie are my people,

32:21.290 --> 32:22.656
so the way I get
on with you guys,

32:22.675 --> 32:25.258
I'm not getting on
with daisy and ashley.

32:25.294 --> 32:26.843
-No?
-Mm-mmm.

32:26.879 --> 32:29.730
I don't like this version
of myself on this boat.

32:29.765 --> 32:32.466
Well, you need to be the best
version you can be, you know?

32:32.501 --> 32:33.850
I know, but you know,
I got in trouble, and...

32:33.886 --> 32:35.435
Did you?

32:35.471 --> 32:36.836
...I had a talking-to, and...

32:36.855 --> 32:38.639
No one's perfect on board.

32:38.674 --> 32:40.340
You know, everyone has
their flaws and their faults.

32:40.359 --> 32:41.841
People are gonna have
differences, you know?

32:41.860 --> 32:43.510
There's gonna be
personality conflicts,

32:43.529 --> 32:45.562
especially when you work
so closely on a boat like this

32:45.614 --> 32:47.514
and you're with
each other 24/7.

32:47.549 --> 32:49.316
So, don't beat
yourself up about it.

32:49.351 --> 32:52.018
You can kind of see from
day one that ashley felt

32:52.037 --> 32:54.371
she should be second stew.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.590
I have no problem
respecting you at all.

32:56.625 --> 32:58.525
You lead the way I wanna be led.

32:58.560 --> 32:59.876
So, it's the way
she's asking you?

32:59.912 --> 33:01.495
It's the way, like,
it's conveyed.

33:01.530 --> 33:03.330
Maybe that's not the way
you would do it,

33:03.365 --> 33:05.215
but when you're second and
chief, you get to choose.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.334
It just makes me wonder
if she's going out of her way

33:07.369 --> 33:09.336
to make gabriela
feel uncomfortable,

33:09.371 --> 33:11.705
which is the worst
possible thing to do

33:11.724 --> 33:14.007
to try and move up the ladder.

33:14.042 --> 33:15.559
Thanks for the chat, gary.

33:15.594 --> 33:16.876
You're welcome.

33:16.895 --> 33:18.895
-I'm gonna go to bed.
-Awesome.

33:20.399 --> 33:23.684
Good night.
Gimme a hug. Thank you.

33:23.719 --> 33:25.719
-Love you, gary.
-Love you, too.

33:25.738 --> 33:27.270
Mm... Oi.

33:33.445 --> 33:38.782
Ashley? Hey, love.

33:38.834 --> 33:40.667
All right, well...

34:01.440 --> 34:02.689
All right, so we have
work at 8:00.

34:02.725 --> 34:03.640
Yeah.

34:15.938 --> 34:18.238
[alarm sounds]

34:29.785 --> 34:31.117
this morning.

34:31.136 --> 34:32.686
Nothing needs to be done
downstairs again, right?

34:32.721 --> 34:33.970
Vacuum.

34:34.006 --> 34:35.956
Cool, thanks, girls.

34:35.991 --> 34:38.642
-Good morning, sunshine!
-Morning.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.594
Are you ready for the day?

34:40.629 --> 34:41.595
No, not really.

34:41.630 --> 34:43.029
We gon' be ready.

34:45.467 --> 34:47.400
At least it was
clean rain last night,

34:47.436 --> 34:49.352
so it kind of helped us a bit.

34:49.404 --> 34:50.937
It's like the cleanest the
boat's been all ----ing week.

34:52.641 --> 34:55.659
<i> All crew, all crew,</i>
<i> provisions are here.</i>

34:55.694 --> 34:56.810
Whoa, mother----er.

34:58.647 --> 35:00.680
Who needs to join a gym
when you work on a yacht?

35:02.684 --> 35:04.684
Okay, that's it for
now, I think.

35:10.042 --> 35:12.092
Ooh, clase azul.

35:14.830 --> 35:18.381
So, I mean, we only need
these fenders at the dock.

35:18.433 --> 35:20.033
You know what
I'm gonna do, actually?

35:20.068 --> 35:21.802
We're tying these on,
and then we're leaving them.

35:21.837 --> 35:24.437
Now that tom's gone,
kelsie and I are sleeping

35:24.473 --> 35:25.806
a fraction of the time
than everyone else.

35:25.841 --> 35:27.941
Hey, kels, come
to the dock please.

35:27.976 --> 35:29.442
<i> Yo, yo.</i>

35:29.478 --> 35:30.811
Ugh.

35:30.846 --> 35:32.362
Securing these fenders
to the dock,

35:32.397 --> 35:33.814
it's a lot less work for us.

35:33.849 --> 35:36.015
It's gonna be a win-win
situation for everyone.

35:36.034 --> 35:37.884
Tie bowline to bowline
like about that length

35:37.920 --> 35:41.020
on two of the fenders.

35:41.039 --> 35:42.589
But this, I mean,
you can pull up tight.

35:42.624 --> 35:43.690
You can't move the fender now.

35:43.725 --> 35:46.059
Yeah, perfect. I like it.

35:46.094 --> 35:48.912
Cool, if we just do
a last-minute kind of wipe.

35:48.964 --> 35:50.831
-Gary?
-Yo?

35:50.866 --> 35:52.499
I went and had a look...

35:52.534 --> 35:54.801
All the storm last night
brought a lot of swell with it.

35:54.837 --> 35:56.436
Yeah.

35:56.471 --> 35:57.637
You can see there's
a little bit of chop.

35:57.673 --> 35:58.839
Oh, there's waves
in there.

35:58.874 --> 36:00.540
Yeah, there is a bit of swell.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.475
[bleep] so coming out,
it's gonna be rough...

36:02.511 --> 36:04.878
We should be able to get some
sail up to stabilize it.

36:04.897 --> 36:08.732
<i> All crew, all crew, the guests</i>
<i> will be here in 10 minutes.</i>

36:08.767 --> 36:10.016
<i> Please suit up, thank you.</i>

36:10.051 --> 36:12.085
Copy, copy, changing now.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.827
Quick little walkaround,
and a shower.

36:20.863 --> 36:22.629
Looks fine, [bleep] it.

36:22.664 --> 36:23.663
Looks great down here.

36:23.699 --> 36:25.832
We have some sunglasses here?

36:25.868 --> 36:28.001
-I'll do the champagne today.
-Okay.

36:28.036 --> 36:29.502
-Hey, dais?
-Yeah?

36:29.538 --> 36:31.004
So, you're gonna
remake the master, eh?

36:31.039 --> 36:32.906
What?

36:32.925 --> 36:34.541
Well, because you said
we're sleeping together,

36:34.576 --> 36:35.709
so I was in bed waiting
for you last night.

36:38.847 --> 36:41.548
<i> All crew, all crew, let's get</i>
<i> everybody in the cockpit.</i>

36:44.102 --> 36:46.586
-Okay.
-You guys almost ready?

36:46.622 --> 36:48.121
Yeah. Yes.

36:48.156 --> 36:49.940
So, it's gonna be rolly
for probably up to an hour.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.441
Ooh.

36:51.476 --> 36:52.826
And it'll get better
during the day.

36:52.861 --> 36:54.728
Okay, let's go, let's go.

36:56.098 --> 36:57.731
Oh, oh... Oh, whoa, whoa.

36:57.766 --> 37:00.984
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

37:01.036 --> 37:02.903
Opa!

37:02.938 --> 37:04.738
[bleep]

37:04.773 --> 37:05.906
what happened there?

37:05.941 --> 37:07.440
Perfect timing.

37:07.459 --> 37:08.708
This is gonna take a while,
isn't it?

37:08.744 --> 37:09.876
[bleep] me.

37:13.347 --> 37:14.981
Okay, let's go, let's go.

37:15.450 --> 37:18.318
Oh, oh... Oh.

37:18.353 --> 37:22.155
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

37:22.190 --> 37:23.156
Opa!

37:23.191 --> 37:24.824
Perfect timing.

37:24.860 --> 37:26.059
This is gonna take
a while, isn't it?

37:26.094 --> 37:27.894
Kelsie, get a hose ready.

37:27.930 --> 37:30.530
Make sure we don't
track any glass inside.

37:30.565 --> 37:31.698
Jesus christ.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.634
Nailing it.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.770
There's always
one champagne glass

37:36.805 --> 37:38.021
that sends them all flying.

37:38.073 --> 37:39.639
[bleep] me.

37:39.675 --> 37:40.974
It's a pretty boat,
though, huh, honey?

37:41.009 --> 37:43.009
-That's it. Wow.
-Oh, my god.

37:43.045 --> 37:45.145
How long is it gonna take
you to finish this,

37:45.180 --> 37:46.246
because the guests are walking
towards the boat now.

37:48.333 --> 37:49.849
Oh, my gosh.

37:49.885 --> 37:51.151
Rookie mistake.

37:51.186 --> 37:52.319
All the pieces.

37:52.354 --> 37:54.788
Right behind you,
coming through.

37:57.225 --> 37:59.960
-Hello! How are you? Hi!
-Hi, guys. I'm captain glenn.

37:59.995 --> 38:01.194
This is dawn.

38:01.229 --> 38:02.762
I'm tim miller,
nice to meet you.

38:02.798 --> 38:03.863
Nice to meet you, tim.
Welcome to menorca.

38:03.899 --> 38:05.015
Thank you. Let's do this!

38:05.050 --> 38:06.016
Okay.

38:06.051 --> 38:07.033
Oh, jesus.

38:07.069 --> 38:08.835
Amazing.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.837
-Hello.
-Hi!

38:10.856 --> 38:12.639
-Hello, thank you.
-Hi, I'm ashley. Hi!

38:12.674 --> 38:14.174
-I'm colin.
-Hi, colin, marni.

38:14.209 --> 38:17.176
-Marcos, nice to meet you.
-Marcos, nice to meet you.

38:17.195 --> 38:19.362
-Gabriela.
-Hi, I'm dawn.

38:19.398 --> 38:20.981
All right, well,
I wanna formally

38:21.016 --> 38:22.382
welcome you onto parsifal.

38:22.417 --> 38:24.351
We got a great trip
planned for you.

38:24.386 --> 38:26.202
I'm gonna hand you over
to daisy right now.

38:26.238 --> 38:28.621
If you want to follow
me up the stairs.

38:28.657 --> 38:29.622
I'm gonna go on luggage,
you guys good?

38:29.658 --> 38:31.224
Yeah.

38:31.259 --> 38:33.994
Back here, we've got the hot
tub, nice place to hang out.

38:34.029 --> 38:36.796
That steering wheel is huge.

38:36.832 --> 38:38.698
You guys are all boaties.

38:39.868 --> 38:41.701
What goes on down here?

38:41.737 --> 38:43.837
We have the main saloon,
obviously the bar area...

38:43.872 --> 38:45.705
This is also a
favorite hangout spot.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.173
Here's your discotheque, dawn.

38:47.209 --> 38:48.174
Dance party.

38:48.210 --> 38:49.209
[grunts]

38:49.244 --> 38:51.594
in here, we have the master,

38:51.646 --> 38:53.179
which is probably big enough
to fit all six of you.

38:53.214 --> 38:56.182
We share.
This is awesome.

38:56.218 --> 38:58.118
And then in here we have
two twin cabins

38:58.153 --> 38:59.903
that are both
completely identical.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.604
I wanna see this when we move.

39:01.656 --> 39:02.922
Colin, colin, glenn.

39:02.958 --> 39:04.223
<i> You can fire up</i>
<i> whenever you like.</i>

39:04.242 --> 39:05.658
Okay, firing up now.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.761
How relaxing.

39:07.796 --> 39:09.629
-They're really nice.
-Yeah.

39:10.966 --> 39:12.766
You can drop lines
whenever you like.

39:12.801 --> 39:14.267
Okay, we can take the
stern line off.

39:14.302 --> 39:16.669
-What is this?
-Mini salmon carpaccio.

39:18.273 --> 39:21.775
This is a mini salmon carpaccio.

39:22.844 --> 39:24.878
What time would you like lunch?

39:24.913 --> 39:26.146
Lunch at 4:00,
dinner at 9:00?

39:26.181 --> 39:27.280
-Yeah, sure, absolutely.
-Ooh!

39:27.315 --> 39:28.815
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

39:28.850 --> 39:30.216
Stern line clear.

39:30.252 --> 39:31.434
Put the thrusters,
and let's get going.

39:31.470 --> 39:32.852
Oh, we're leaving.

39:32.888 --> 39:34.287
I wanna see this boat
take off, baby.

39:34.322 --> 39:35.822
Yeah, I wanna see.

39:37.325 --> 39:38.792
This is beautiful.

39:38.827 --> 39:40.860
Okay, lunch at 4:00,
dinner at 9:00.

39:40.896 --> 39:42.779
Got it.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.114
You're doing family-style for
lunch, and are you gonna do...

39:44.149 --> 39:45.115
For lunch and dinner.

39:45.150 --> 39:46.232
Just, like, I do one vegan.

39:46.268 --> 39:48.034
And the rest normal.

39:48.070 --> 39:49.619
And if it's fish,
it's fish for everyone, so...

39:51.206 --> 39:52.772
Sizeable swell, eh?

39:52.808 --> 39:54.991
These are not small
swells out here, though.

39:55.043 --> 39:57.811
-I love it.
-Whee!

39:57.846 --> 40:00.313
This is horrible,
I just feel sick.

40:00.348 --> 40:02.449
Hey, mate,
let's get ready to sail.

40:02.484 --> 40:04.317
It's gonna be a
little bit lumpy out here,

40:04.352 --> 40:05.885
but the sailing should help.

40:09.341 --> 40:11.958
Start going on the mizzen.

40:11.993 --> 40:13.476
Oh, they're putting
the sails up.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.195
Did you see?

40:15.230 --> 40:17.147
Okay, let's go main.

40:17.182 --> 40:18.481
Four wraps.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.166
-Woo! Hang on, girls.
-We're moving.

40:20.202 --> 40:21.301
And hold.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.736
Okay, gary, get the genoa out.

40:23.772 --> 40:24.971
Wow, let's go in the back.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.305
-Okay.
-Let's move around, guys.

40:26.324 --> 40:28.074
-How's that, gary?
-All right, yeah, hold.

40:28.110 --> 40:29.325
Excellent. Okay, let's go.

40:29.361 --> 40:32.145
This lean...
This is pretty cool.

40:32.180 --> 40:33.346
It's amazing.

40:33.381 --> 40:35.348
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:35.383 --> 40:37.333
Those lounges on the bow
are about to slide off.

40:37.369 --> 40:39.169
I'm on it.

40:39.204 --> 40:41.054
I'm worried this is gonna slide
if I don't hold it.

40:41.089 --> 40:43.322
Ah!

40:43.341 --> 40:44.924
Just make sure they don't
go anywhere.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.342
Whoa.

40:46.378 --> 40:47.861
Oops!

40:47.896 --> 40:49.195
Woo!

40:49.231 --> 40:50.196
Wow.

40:50.232 --> 40:51.364
Yeah.

40:51.399 --> 40:53.099
-It's moving.
-We're going.

40:54.936 --> 40:56.936
I love it.

40:56.972 --> 40:58.338
Blowing away with this cushion.

40:58.373 --> 41:00.173
<i> Gary, gary, glenn.</i>

41:00.208 --> 41:01.841
I wanna get the main out a bit
more to slow down the roll,

41:01.877 --> 41:03.209
<i> because we're gonna</i>
<i> get rolled around.</i>

41:03.245 --> 41:04.244
Copy.

41:04.279 --> 41:06.513
Let's just get going like this.

41:06.548 --> 41:08.031
[grinding]

41:08.066 --> 41:10.383
[bleep] that runner
stopped working.

41:10.418 --> 41:14.387
Can you have a look at that
starboard runner in the cockpit?

41:14.422 --> 41:16.089
I think there's an issue,

41:16.124 --> 41:17.924
because it stopped coming
out when I was easing it.

41:17.959 --> 41:19.792
-Copy.
-Thanks.

41:19.828 --> 41:22.795
<i> Kels, kels, can you come</i>
<i> to the mid-cockpit, please?</i>

41:22.831 --> 41:24.397
I guess you guys could tell
it's a bit lumpy out here...

41:24.432 --> 41:26.232
Oh, it's fine.

41:26.268 --> 41:28.168
...Because the wind's been
blowing out of this direction.

41:28.203 --> 41:30.170
So, we're gonna sail down around
the south part of the island,

41:30.205 --> 41:33.873
so we should be able to
get out of this rolly sea.

41:33.909 --> 41:35.375
I brought some fresh water
for everyone.

41:35.410 --> 41:37.177
Thank you.

41:37.212 --> 41:39.412
[bleep] me... Just, this,
like, this never happens.

41:39.447 --> 41:41.414
That's bunched there
massively,

41:41.449 --> 41:43.349
so we're gonna have to take
everything out of the lockers.

41:43.385 --> 41:45.418
It can't be that fun downstairs.

41:45.453 --> 41:47.187
Yeah. Just unbelievable.

41:49.257 --> 41:51.591
Ah, wait!

41:51.626 --> 41:53.293
This is a little bit ridiculous.

41:53.328 --> 41:54.294
[slamming]

41:55.947 --> 41:57.780
what is that slamming?

41:57.832 --> 41:59.799
<i> These sliding doors are</i>
<i> slamming</i>

41:59.834 --> 42:01.367
<i> open and closed,</i>
<i> colin, colin.</i>

42:01.402 --> 42:03.236
Oh, jesus christ.

42:03.255 --> 42:04.804
They're gonna break!

42:04.839 --> 42:06.572
Dog those doors, please,
dog those doors.

42:06.591 --> 42:08.575
Hold, they're gonna break.

42:08.610 --> 42:13.096
Ah mother----er! Sh--!

42:13.131 --> 42:17.217
That's a bust.
Get out of my way. Ah!

42:17.252 --> 42:18.601
-That holding?
-Yeah.

42:18.637 --> 42:23.289
Mother----er, that hurts!

42:23.325 --> 42:25.191
Ah!

42:26.494 --> 42:28.161
Next, on "below deck
sailing yacht"...

42:31.099 --> 42:32.999
What's going on with you
and gabriela?

42:38.957 --> 42:40.439
This isn't fun for me,

42:40.458 --> 42:42.441
and I don't wanna drag
anyone else down, either.

42:42.460 --> 42:44.911
I don't think I can
last four more charters.

42:44.946 --> 42:46.446
[sobs]

42:46.481 --> 42:48.181
it won't take long to
clear that, though, right?

42:48.216 --> 42:51.484
It's incredibly frustrating
when the captain and I

42:51.519 --> 42:52.468
are not on the same page.

42:52.504 --> 42:54.153
Here we ----ing go.

42:54.189 --> 42:56.022
Scoot on your bootie.

42:56.057 --> 42:57.623
Sh--.

42:57.642 --> 42:59.976
Well, sh--, everything's gonna
----ing break.

43:00.011 --> 43:01.511
It's a ----ing joke.
