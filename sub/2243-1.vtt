01:49.068 --> 01:51.654
(wind blows )

02:21.684 --> 02:24.019
Woman: First big one
of the season.

02:24.103 --> 02:27.106
Man: Yep.
It's heading right for base.

02:30.359 --> 02:32.695
Woman: It's gonna mess up Kim's dig.

02:33.696 --> 02:35.823
She's not gonna like that.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.742
Yeah, well,
I don't like it much either.

02:39.410 --> 02:40.744
There's a surprise.

02:42.413 --> 02:45.583
Lighten up, Vince,
a bit of dust never hurt anyone.

02:50.212 --> 02:52.214
It's not the dust
I'm worried about.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.552
- Vince: Harrington, you seeing this?
- Yeah, it's a beast.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.263
Cycle down the backup grids
in case we lose anything.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.473
- (jazz music playing )
- We'll be back as soon as we pick up Kim.

04:29.687 --> 04:31.689
(drilling)

04:38.070 --> 04:40.072
Vince: Campbell to Aldrich.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.746
Vince: Campbell to Aldrich.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.835
(Vince sighs)

04:52.918 --> 04:55.129
Campbell to Aldrich.
Come in, Kim.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.136
It's 15:30, Kim.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.517
Come on, Kim,
time to wrap it up.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.144
Fuck off.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.024
Actually, I'd be happy to, Kim.

05:15.107 --> 05:18.027
Unfortunately, Brunei
wants you back at the briefing.

05:18.110 --> 05:22.072
Kim: Well, he'll have to wait,
won't he?

05:22.948 --> 05:25.326
(sighs)

05:25.409 --> 05:28.329
Ten things about Mars you won't miss
when you're back on Earth.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.831
Only ten?

05:30.914 --> 05:33.834
Uh... storms.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.836
Your driving.

05:35.919 --> 05:36.962
Kim.

05:38.339 --> 05:39.673
Kim.

05:39.757 --> 05:41.550
- Kim.
- ( chuckles)

05:43.927 --> 05:49.266
A six-month commute home
in a floating coffin. With Kim.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.101
Is that ten?
I've lost count already.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.187
It's not a coffin, Vince.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.815
But that's an interesting
choice of words.

05:56.899 --> 06:02.196
Okay. A nice big spaceship.
What do you want me to say?

06:03.781 --> 06:06.658
Woman: We get out
and walk at the end.

06:06.742 --> 06:10.746
On green grass.
Under blue skies.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.166
Yeah.

06:15.751 --> 06:19.505
Green grass. Blue skies.

06:21.173 --> 06:25.052
(Vince singing)
Blue skies around the corner

06:25.135 --> 06:28.222
Everything's gonna be right

06:28.305 --> 06:32.768
Never a cloud
in those bright blue skies

06:32.851 --> 06:35.813
( hums)

06:35.896 --> 06:37.231
Woman: Running late, Kim.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.233
Kim: Don't worry,
I'll take the heat.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.402
Did you get all the samples
you wanted?

06:41.485 --> 06:45.114
Does it matter?
We're still going back empty-handed.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.950
Come on, Kim. That's not fair.
We've achieved a lot here.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.828
Yeah, like what?

06:50.911 --> 06:54.790
As far as I'm concerned, we're just
sharpening pencils for the next crew.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.751
Whoever remembered the second man
on the moon anyway?

06:57.835 --> 06:59.253
Woman: It was Buzz Aldrin.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.213
Vince: Yeah, first man
to piss on the moon.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.297
What?

07:02.381 --> 07:04.299
He pissed himself on the moon.
You didn't know that?

07:04.425 --> 07:06.885
Well, that's something for us all
to aspire to, isn't it?

07:08.554 --> 07:10.764
I just don't want to go home
with nothing.

07:10.889 --> 07:14.518
- Six months isn't enough time.
- You could always stay.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.854
Vincent, why don't you just go...

07:17.938 --> 07:20.065
Let's go.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.344
Man 1: Rover One, where are you?
We've got circuits failing all over.

07:49.428 --> 07:51.346
Vince: Sorry. Got held up.
On our way.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.182
All right, but we need you back here.

07:53.265 --> 07:56.768
We've lost our link to the Aurora
and Harrington can't handle it alone.

07:56.852 --> 07:59.980
Where's Vincent?
I wanna talk to my daughter.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.357
On his way, I hope.

08:02.441 --> 08:07.279
Six months cruising and now this.
Bit of a mess.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.324
Be all right. We're in
the home stretch. One more day.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.541
Hey. When you wake up,

08:19.625 --> 08:23.003
I'd love to know how long
it'll be before skylink's restored.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.796
Sorry. Uh...

08:26.089 --> 08:28.800
- Yeah, nearly there.
- ( computer beeps )

08:28.884 --> 08:32.179
Ah, yeah. This should be it.
Here we go.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.765
Man: We've lost your signal,
do you copy?

08:34.847 --> 08:37.267
Sorry, guys. We had a power outage
due to the storm.

08:37.351 --> 08:40.854
We can see it from Sat Four.
You had us worried for a minute.

08:40.938 --> 08:45.025
All right, time check: final approach
burn in 19 hours, 56 minutes.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.610
Copy that. Safe orbit.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.238
Be great to see you guys again.
Brunei out.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.865
- Man 1: For fuck's sake.
- Man 2: Jesus, no.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.367
Brunei: All right.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.536
Manual check everything.
All systems.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.965
Woman: What are you so happy about?

09:08.131 --> 09:10.300
Harrington:
Vince, tell me you're close by.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.761
We're on our own until you get
these systems back online.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.429
Vince: Roger that.
Almost there.

09:14.513 --> 09:17.307
Keep losing charge on this thing.
Don't want to push it too hard.

09:17.391 --> 09:20.561
Roger that, Vince.

09:20.644 --> 09:22.688
Man: I need a word.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.150
Brunei: All right. Okay.

09:32.364 --> 09:35.117
- I need to go back out again.
- Forget it.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.745
We've got a briefing.
We need everyone on base.

09:38.829 --> 09:39.913
What's going on?

09:39.997 --> 09:42.165
Gamma sensor on Site Nine
isn't responding.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.835
Storm damage, possibly.
I don't know.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.087
You didn't check it
before you came back?

09:47.170 --> 09:50.841
What do you want me to say?
I'm a fucking idiot? I'm sorry.

09:50.924 --> 09:55.262
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
The sun's about to go down.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.098
I signed off on this site.
I'll be quick.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.976
It's going to look bad,
really bad for everybody

10:01.059 --> 10:03.145
if the relief crew
has to come out and fix it.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.938
A lot of things
need fixing around here.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.190
You'll have Vincent in no time.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.866
Take Harrington.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.744
And make sure you're back
before dark. Is that clear?

10:18.827 --> 10:19.870
Thank you.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.955
I want everybody cleaned up
before we do our final briefing.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.249
You know I don't fuck around.

10:25.584 --> 10:28.211
Harrington, let's go.
Rover number two, now.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.803
Sir, you want us to go outside?

10:36.887 --> 10:38.764
Just make sure you're back
before dark.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.505
(sighs)

11:24.893 --> 11:27.813
- Woman: Are you all right?
- Huh?

11:27.896 --> 11:29.439
Vince: Yeah. Yeah.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.025
Listen.

11:32.109 --> 11:34.528
- ( Beep )
- Never get sick of that sound.

11:38.365 --> 11:42.494
- Vince: Where are you guys going?
- Soak up some more radiation.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.746
Try making babies
after this mission, huh?

11:44.830 --> 11:46.873
- Woman: Too funny.
- Well, I'm laughing.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.417
- What the hell are you doing?
- Harry...

11:48.500 --> 11:51.628
if that cooling system's down,
I'm gonna need your help back there.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.005
Sorry, man. You're gonna have to
speak to Brunei. It's not my call.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.550
( Man sings in Serbian )

12:02.347 --> 12:04.099
We bust our asses
to get back here

12:04.182 --> 12:07.811
and those pricks get to
fucking go out again.

12:10.313 --> 12:14.025
Nineteen hours.
It's just 19 hours.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.903
So what do you know about
cooling systems?

12:19.740 --> 12:21.742
Harrington: So what's the score?

12:21.825 --> 12:24.828
Man: Marko Petrovic one, Kim nil.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.581
- What?
- Never mind.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.750
We're fixing a broken sensor.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.503
Did you hear?

12:34.963 --> 12:37.758
Right. So are we gonna be long?

12:37.841 --> 12:41.011
Well, it takes as long as it takes.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.556
Oh, come on, man.
Brunei's not gonna like this.

12:44.639 --> 12:49.102
You want to speed things up, Harry,
go prep the sample boxes then, okay?

12:49.186 --> 12:52.355
Date, grid reference,
and new prefix. MA-1.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.735
MA-1?

12:58.403 --> 13:01.156
Microscopic anomaly.
( chuckles )

13:04.826 --> 13:09.498
- Hold on. Does Brunei know?
- Just trust me on this one, okay?

13:16.004 --> 13:18.006
( Chuckles )

13:20.592 --> 13:23.512
Are you cosy in there?

13:23.595 --> 13:25.597
Like a bug in a rug.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.895
- You talk to Ella?
- No, I missed the window.

13:33.855 --> 13:37.108
Shit, man. I'm sorry about that.

13:37.192 --> 13:42.155
I got... you know, delayed.

13:42.239 --> 13:44.366
- Kim.
- Yeah.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.369
Never mind. I'll get
another chance back on Aurora.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.871
Hey, I come bearing gifts.
You want some?

14:00.257 --> 14:03.176
- Jesus Christ.
- What's up?

14:03.260 --> 14:06.263
Half the CO2 scrubbers
are down on the Aurora.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.014
Check out this approach trajectory.

14:08.098 --> 14:11.351
These guys are gonna get
pulled over for drunk driving.

14:11.434 --> 14:12.561
Can't we at least get on board

14:12.644 --> 14:15.897
before you start worrying
about the Aurora?

14:15.981 --> 14:18.108
Aren't you excited to go home?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.693
Home isn't the issue.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.945
It's the six months it takes
to get there

14:22.028 --> 14:25.282
strapped to the back of
a nuclear warhead I'm worried about.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.242
(sighs)

14:28.660 --> 14:30.996
- What?
- Are you all right?

14:31.079 --> 14:32.747
( Chuckles )

14:32.831 --> 14:34.416
Come on, Irwin.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.419
Can we please not do
the whole analysis thing right now?

14:37.502 --> 14:39.671
- I got a lot of work to do.
- You know how it is.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.298
You're not happy if things
aren't working.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.383
I'm not happy
if you're not happy.

14:43.466 --> 14:47.762
I'm happy. I'm ecstatic. See?

14:47.846 --> 14:51.600
- Okay. All right.
- See? Happy, happy, happy-

14:51.683 --> 14:53.727
All right, we're happy.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.480
Uh-oh.
Get the popcorn out.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.608
( Muffled argument )

15:01.735 --> 15:03.778
Who's your money on?

15:03.862 --> 15:07.407
Are you kidding me?
Kim. Every time.

15:07.490 --> 15:11.494
She's got a point, though.
How come Marko gets a free pass?

15:29.346 --> 15:31.348
So, what do you reckon?

15:32.557 --> 15:37.270
We all go back home, find God,

15:37.354 --> 15:40.273
write a poem about it
like the moon walkers did?

15:40.357 --> 15:43.860
It did change them.
They all said so.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.612
People don't really change.

15:45.695 --> 15:48.698
Put them under enough pressure,
you find out who they really are.

15:48.782 --> 15:52.202
God, that is deep.
Are you gonna put that in a poem?

16:01.378 --> 16:05.215
- That was uncomfortable.
- ( groans )

16:10.136 --> 16:11.179
What's she doing?

16:16.434 --> 16:19.479
Kim, that's Marko's workstation.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.481
I just wanna know
what's so urgent.

16:21.564 --> 16:25.276
You can't go through his private log.
Come on, Vincent, tell her!

16:25.360 --> 16:28.571
( Chuckles ) Oh, yeah.
Like she's gonna listen to me.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.199
- This is bullshit.
- Kim, she's right.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.451
Just 'cause he broke the rules,
it doesn't make it fair game.

16:33.535 --> 16:37.080
There's no way Marko gives a shit
about a broken sensor, okay?

16:37.163 --> 16:39.666
I just want to know why his research
is more important than mine.

16:43.253 --> 16:45.422
Vince: What?

16:47.090 --> 16:48.925
That's definitely
not what it looks like.

16:49.009 --> 16:52.387
Those cavities in the rock...
those could be microbial borings.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.055
PAH's can be formed non-organically.

16:54.139 --> 16:57.100
- Sample still under the scope?
- Kim: I'll check.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.561
All right, anyone want to tell me
what's going on?

16:59.644 --> 17:01.855
Nothing's going on.

17:01.938 --> 17:05.233
He found a piece of
abiotic mineral. Bullshit.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.578
Got it.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.914
( Scoffs )

17:21.374 --> 17:22.959
Holy shit.

17:25.962 --> 17:28.798
- Brunei: That looks like...
- Woman: New cell division.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.635
Bacterial cell division.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.725
Brunei: I want that site locked down.
No one goes near.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.436
We'll upload the scans and data
to Mission Control,

17:41.519 --> 17:43.271
see if they confirm
Lane's conclusions.

17:43.354 --> 17:46.066
We need to speak to Marko first.
It's his find.

17:46.149 --> 17:49.402
He's the one who's been playing silly
games. Why didn't he talk to us?

17:49.486 --> 17:51.529
Because that would be
sharing the credit.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.156
That's not fair.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.450
I think we're missing the point.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.118
This is what we came here for,
isn't it?

17:57.202 --> 17:59.913
- Don't you think we ought to check it out?
- Dalby: He knows what he's doing.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.123
So, we're going to entrust
the greatest find in human history

18:02.207 --> 18:04.876
to a man who just lied to you?
Is that it?

18:13.676 --> 18:16.638
Rover Two, this is base.
You at Site Nine yet?

18:16.721 --> 18:18.973
Yeah, we, um... We got here
a couple of minutes ago.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.100
What's up, sir?

18:20.183 --> 18:25.605
Brunei: I'm declaring the site
off limits. Put Marko on now.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.065
Yep. Stand by, base.

18:27.148 --> 18:31.152
Marko, I've got Brunei on comms.
Are you copying any of this?

18:31.236 --> 18:33.238
That's negative.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.198
( Speaks Serbian )

18:35.281 --> 18:36.449
Can you speak in English
please, mate?

18:36.574 --> 18:38.952
Tell them the signal
is breaking up.

18:38.993 --> 18:42.080
Tell them you can't see me now.
Tell...

18:46.084 --> 18:48.086
( mutters Serbian )

18:50.505 --> 18:52.632
I've got Brunei
holding on the other line.

18:52.715 --> 18:55.468
Don't argue with me now.

18:55.552 --> 18:58.012
Just come out and bring
the camera with you.

18:58.096 --> 19:01.975
You have to see this, Harry.
It's beautiful.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.643
( Loud cracking )

19:03.726 --> 19:05.270
Harry! Harry! Help!

19:05.937 --> 19:07.605
Marko!

19:09.774 --> 19:11.317
- Come on!
- ( beeping )

19:11.401 --> 19:13.319
( panting )

19:18.074 --> 19:19.617
Oh, my God.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.376
Harrington: Mayday!
This is Harrington to base.

19:28.459 --> 19:32.755
I need help here.
Repeat, mayday! Please help.

19:59.741 --> 20:02.493
Brunei: What happened?
Harrington: He's gone.

20:02.577 --> 20:04.621
Have you been down there to him?

20:04.704 --> 20:06.414
Why aren't you down there,
Harrington?

20:07.332 --> 20:11.252
- I tried.
- Well, you didn't try hard enough.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.254
- I'm gonna go down there myself!
- No, Dalby.

20:13.338 --> 20:14.923
- He could still be alive!
- You'll rip your suit,

20:15.006 --> 20:17.508
- or break your neck.
- I haven't pronounced it yet.

20:17.592 --> 20:20.595
I'm pronouncing it, Dalby.
He's dead.

20:20.678 --> 20:22.305
I'm not gonna risk another life,
so stand down.

20:22.388 --> 20:25.558
People are pulled from frozen water
all the time and revived.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.060
You don't know he's dead!
You don't know!

20:27.143 --> 20:28.686
Dalby, stand down.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.564
- ( Sniffs )
- Stand down.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.287
He said he'd found something, sir.

21:00.301 --> 21:03.096
Nobody goes down there
until we've got the right gear.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.600
We've gotta run this
by Mission Control.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.060
How long will it take?

21:09.143 --> 21:12.605
Altogether, 30 to 40 minutes.

21:13.690 --> 21:16.109
Sir. Uh...

21:18.069 --> 21:20.947
I really wanna stay here.
We can't just leave him like this.

21:21.030 --> 21:24.450
No. I need to do it.
You've done enough.

21:28.079 --> 21:30.290
You're not gonna do
anything stupid, are you?

21:32.458 --> 21:36.087
You're not gonna go in that pit.
Is that clear?

21:36.170 --> 21:39.757
- Is that clear?
- ( sniffs ) Yes, sir.

21:42.135 --> 21:44.137
All right.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.473
Okay.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.476
This is Brunei.

21:50.560 --> 21:54.772
Contact Mission Control.
We've had an accident.

22:10.747 --> 22:13.666
- Lane: Did you see him?
- No.

22:13.750 --> 22:17.253
Look, skipper, if there's
any chance he's alive,

22:17.337 --> 22:19.714
- we need to get back out there.
- No.

22:19.797 --> 22:22.675
There's no way he survived that fall
without compromising his suit.

22:24.594 --> 22:26.220
Load up the lifting gear.
We'll pull him out

22:26.304 --> 22:27.847
as soon as we hear back
from Mission Control.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.640
Got it.

22:34.270 --> 22:37.607
So when are we planning on
announcing the discovery?

22:37.690 --> 22:40.276
You really are something else
aren't you, Kim?

22:40.360 --> 22:43.988
Hasn't it sunken in yet?
This discovery changes everything.

22:44.072 --> 22:45.990
Takes precedence
over everything, right?

22:46.074 --> 22:47.367
What about human decency?

22:47.450 --> 22:50.745
So I'm the bad guy now
for staying focused on the mission?

22:50.828 --> 22:52.205
I didn't get him killed.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.751
I'm sorry, what does that mean?

22:56.834 --> 22:58.336
What the fuck are you
trying to say there, Kim?

22:58.419 --> 23:00.588
You broke with protocol.
Figure it out.

23:00.671 --> 23:03.383
- You are fucking...
- Hey, hey, hey.

23:03.466 --> 23:05.343
You are unbelievable!

23:05.426 --> 23:07.970
- What's the matter with you?
- Fucking laugh at me.

23:08.054 --> 23:11.682
- Okay, enough. Away.
- Okay.

23:11.766 --> 23:14.727
Nothing wrong with me. I'm not
the one breaking the rules.

23:14.811 --> 23:17.522
- Lane: That's not helpful, Kim.
- Brunei: Just drop it.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.148
Cheers, Kim.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.777
He's falling apart.
Like everything else around here.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.737
All right. That's enough.

23:24.821 --> 23:27.281
Kim: Am I the only one
who's noticed this?

23:27.365 --> 23:29.492
- ( Scoffs )
- ( beeping )

23:31.077 --> 23:34.956
Man: Base from Mission Control,
responding your priority code 13.

23:35.039 --> 23:39.210
What can we say, guys?
We're all in deep shock.

23:39.293 --> 23:41.963
Marko's family has been
informed of the situation,

23:42.130 --> 23:45.675
but we haven't gone public yet
until you confirm his status.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.844
The board are working
on an official statement,

23:47.844 --> 23:50.555
but they'll be looking for you
to put a few words together

23:50.638 --> 23:54.517
if it comes down to that.
Brunei, we copy your safety concerns,

23:54.600 --> 23:58.229
but it's a go for
retrieving Petrovic. Use all caution.

23:58.312 --> 24:01.774
Rough way to end the mission, guys,
but we're behind you 100 percent.

24:01.858 --> 24:04.986
More soon.
16:36, message ends.

24:05.069 --> 24:07.238
( Beeping )

24:07.321 --> 24:09.115
You heard him.
We'll retrieve the body,

24:09.198 --> 24:12.326
then announce Marko's discovery.
Let's go.

24:17.039 --> 24:18.875
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

24:19.584 --> 24:21.335
( Muttering )

24:25.339 --> 24:27.425
Sir, can, um...

24:27.508 --> 24:29.844
Can I have a quiet word, please?

24:29.927 --> 24:31.387
Yeah.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.515
Skipper, I know it's not my place,

24:34.599 --> 24:37.268
but you can't let Kim
behave like that.

24:37.351 --> 24:39.395
Nor anyone else, okay?

24:41.189 --> 24:44.150
Look, I know it's bad,
but we all knew the risks.

24:44.233 --> 24:48.279
Honestly, it's a miracle an accident
hasn't happened up here sooner.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.072
I'm still the one
who let him go out.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.657
No. No, I'm sorry,

24:51.741 --> 24:54.285
with all due respect to Marko,
he brought this on himself.

24:54.368 --> 24:58.289
Any screw-up by anyone on this team,
that's my responsibility.

25:03.211 --> 25:05.963
It's not fair to take Harrington
back out.

25:07.215 --> 25:09.133
He stays here with Kim.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.346
- All right.
- Okay.

26:11.988 --> 26:13.990
( Pants )

26:35.845 --> 26:39.098
- ( radio crackles )
- ( Brunei's voice, distorted )

26:39.181 --> 26:42.935
Sir, you're breaking up.
Repeat your message.

26:43.019 --> 26:46.105
Brunei: Rover One all loaded up.
Heading back to you.

26:46.188 --> 26:47.940
( Faint noise )

26:48.024 --> 26:51.110
How are you holding up out there?

26:51.193 --> 26:52.445
Dalby?

26:55.031 --> 26:58.367
- Sorry, for a second, I...
- ( faint noise )

26:58.451 --> 27:00.369
What is it, Dalby?

27:01.704 --> 27:04.123
( Breathes heavily )

27:04.206 --> 27:06.083
Dalby?

27:06.917 --> 27:09.378
Somebody's coming in.

27:10.421 --> 27:12.131
You're breaking up.
I can't hear you.

27:12.214 --> 27:13.382
Dalby?

27:14.634 --> 27:16.594
Dalby?

27:16.677 --> 27:18.721
( Static on radio )

27:32.526 --> 27:34.737
( gasps )

27:38.324 --> 27:41.243
Brunei: Dalby. Come in, Dalby.
Where the hell is she?

27:41.327 --> 27:43.788
We've had static
at Site Nine all day.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.122
Maybe the comms are down again.

27:45.206 --> 27:47.667
Still doesn't
explain her last response.

27:59.762 --> 28:02.932
Lane, Irwin, check Rover Two.

28:15.486 --> 28:17.571
Brunei: Jeez, it's still
venting steam.

28:17.655 --> 28:19.448
Vince: Must be a lot of water
down there.

28:20.950 --> 28:24.161
If she went down there
after I told her not to...

28:25.287 --> 28:27.581
Dalby. Come in, Dalby.

28:27.665 --> 28:29.917
Please respond.

28:31.293 --> 28:33.546
Please respond.

28:34.755 --> 28:36.048
There's nothing in Rover Two.

28:36.132 --> 28:39.677
She wouldn't disobey an order.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.011
Maybe she fell in.

28:41.095 --> 28:45.433
Can't see the bottom.
How deep do you think it is?

28:45.516 --> 28:47.351
I don't like this one bit.

28:48.769 --> 28:51.939
All right, Vince. Strap up.
Let's see what's down there.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.775
Yes, sir.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.203
Gets a little tight
down there, doesn't it?

29:07.496 --> 29:08.873
All right.

29:08.956 --> 29:11.459
( Inhales quickly)

29:11.542 --> 29:13.377
Here we go.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.673
(machine whirs)

29:28.559 --> 29:30.811
All right.

29:30.895 --> 29:32.521
Jesus.

29:34.648 --> 29:36.400
You all right down there?

29:36.484 --> 29:40.029
Oh, yeah. Never better.

29:41.864 --> 29:46.702
It's, uh, nice.
A walk in the park.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.043
Jesus Christ.

29:55.044 --> 29:56.086
Okay.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.381
Mark me off!

30:03.135 --> 30:05.429
(grunts)

30:10.935 --> 30:12.853
Holy shit.

30:12.937 --> 30:14.814
What? What do you see?

30:18.234 --> 30:20.402
I don't know. It's, uh...

30:21.153 --> 30:24.949
In the rock formations, there's...
something growing on them.

30:25.032 --> 30:27.034
Like, uh...

30:28.911 --> 30:30.955
I don't know what it is, but...

30:31.038 --> 30:32.873
It's definitely alive.

30:34.792 --> 30:35.835
We should bring him up.

30:35.918 --> 30:39.088
I'm gonna try and get a little lower.
See if I can find Marko.

30:39.171 --> 30:42.299
- Take me down.
- Brunei: You got it, Vince.

30:51.225 --> 30:53.143
( Breathes heavily )

31:01.110 --> 31:03.404
( breathing quickens)

31:18.168 --> 31:20.170
( heavy breathing )

31:25.509 --> 31:27.428
( gasps ) Fuck!

31:33.726 --> 31:37.438
- Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
- Brunei: Vincent.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.984
Bring him up. Bring him up.
Bring him up!

31:46.614 --> 31:48.741
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand!

31:51.118 --> 31:54.747
Vince, are you all right?
Just breathe.

31:54.830 --> 31:57.625
Brunei: We gotcha.
Come on. That's it.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.170
- All right.
- Vincent...

32:01.253 --> 32:03.047
OK, OK, OK.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.132
You're all right.

32:05.215 --> 32:08.886
Brunei: Vincent, what did you see?
Vincent?

32:08.969 --> 32:10.429
Vincent!

32:12.264 --> 32:13.682
Vince: I'm OK.

32:13.766 --> 32:16.393
I'm OK.

32:16.477 --> 32:18.479
What the hell happened down there?

32:19.980 --> 32:23.359
Nothing. I'm good.

32:27.196 --> 32:30.991
I saw the bottom.
They're not there.

32:31.075 --> 32:33.786
Irwin: Skipper, it's Irwin.

32:35.412 --> 32:38.290
There's footprints here.
There's two pairs.

32:38.374 --> 32:40.876
Brunei: What?

32:40.960 --> 32:43.295
Where are they headed?

32:43.379 --> 32:45.673
They're crossing the rift valley.

32:49.051 --> 32:50.761
They look like they're headed
back towards base.

32:50.844 --> 32:53.973
If she pulled him out of there,
why didn't they just take the rover?

32:55.224 --> 32:57.434
This just doesn't make sense.

33:01.230 --> 33:04.650
Call Kim. Tell her to prepare
for one, maybe two casualties.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.114
Kim: He'll be in a bad way
if he's been exposed.

33:10.197 --> 33:14.743
Possible brain damage from
oxygen deprivation, hypoxia...

33:14.827 --> 33:16.829
That's if we're lucky.

33:17.788 --> 33:20.749
- Look, what I said earlier...
- Shut up, Kim. Shut up.

33:20.833 --> 33:23.377
- Let's just forget it, yeah?
- ( beeping )

33:27.131 --> 33:29.800
They're about 50 meters out.

33:29.883 --> 33:31.969
Must be Marko and Dalby, but...

33:32.052 --> 33:34.596
What the hell?
They walked all the way back?

33:35.639 --> 33:38.183
As long as they're OK,
that's all that counts, right?

33:38.267 --> 33:40.894
Base to Dalby,
can you come in, please?

33:40.978 --> 33:44.648
They're coming around to the airlock.
I'm gonna go let them in.

33:44.732 --> 33:47.609
Wait. We haven't
established comms here.

33:56.118 --> 33:57.244
( Air hisses )

34:05.961 --> 34:08.714
Marko! Oh, fuck.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.466
You're okay, you're okay.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.637
- Oh, fuck!
- ( hisses )

34:18.474 --> 34:20.476
( gasps )

34:26.648 --> 34:29.068
Marko, what the fuck
are you doing? Marko!

34:29.902 --> 34:31.695
( Roars )

34:33.655 --> 34:35.282
(drill whirs)

34:36.116 --> 34:37.784
( screams )

34:44.123 --> 34:45.876
( moans )

34:54.842 --> 34:56.011
( alarm )

34:59.556 --> 35:01.225
( roars )

35:01.308 --> 35:03.435
Go!

35:14.863 --> 35:17.157
Base, this is Brunei.
Come in, please.

35:19.159 --> 35:21.161
Brunei: Come in, please. Base.

35:25.165 --> 35:26.208
( Beeping )

35:30.045 --> 35:31.505
(snaﬂs)

35:42.266 --> 35:43.600
(grunts)

35:48.230 --> 35:50.482
Mayday! Mayday!

35:50.566 --> 35:52.901
Brunei: Harrington?

35:52.985 --> 35:55.696
Harrington, please respond.

35:55.779 --> 35:57.406
Lane, Irwin,
check the other side.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.199
- Call me if you see anything.
- Irwin: Okay.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.451
Brunei: Harrington.
Come in, Harrington.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.621
- Stay out here.
- I'm fine, I'm coming with you.

36:04.705 --> 36:06.748
Stay on comms.
I'll call you if I need you.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.292
Look Skipper, I know
I was a little shaky back there.

36:08.375 --> 36:11.712
That's an order.
Don't argue with me.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.049
( Shouts )

36:25.934 --> 36:26.977
( Kim yells)

36:43.118 --> 36:45.537
(slurps)

36:45.621 --> 36:47.289
( rasps )

37:01.261 --> 37:04.223
( screams )

37:05.015 --> 37:07.184
Explain to me
what the hell's going on here.

37:08.936 --> 37:11.355
- What the fuck.
- ( shrieks )

37:11.438 --> 37:14.233
We need to quarantine them here.

37:14.316 --> 37:16.109
Get in a suit. I'll buy you time.
Go, go, go.

37:16.193 --> 37:17.986
I'm right behind you.

37:27.663 --> 37:29.915
Listen to me.
Marko, you're sick.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.833
I want to help you.
Can you understand me?

37:31.917 --> 37:34.628
- I want to help you.
- ( Marko growls )

37:34.711 --> 37:39.341
Vincent, Lane, I'm in the airlock.
I'm coming out.

37:39.424 --> 37:43.220
- Vince: What happened in there?
- They're killing us!

37:45.764 --> 37:48.016
Irwin: Kim? What happened in there?

37:50.936 --> 37:52.104
(snaﬂs)

38:02.656 --> 38:04.616
Lane: Are you all right?
What happened?

38:04.700 --> 38:08.203
- Irwin: Just breathe.
- Marko and Dalby are dead.

38:08.287 --> 38:11.039
They couldn't have survived it.
But they're still moving.

38:11.123 --> 38:12.374
She's not making sense.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.668
If they're moving,
they've got brain function.

38:14.751 --> 38:16.753
If they've got brain function
they're not dead, Kim.

38:16.837 --> 38:18.922
I'm not a fucking idiot!
I know.

38:19.006 --> 38:20.590
Vince: The airlock.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.303
Kim: It's Brunei.

38:24.386 --> 38:28.807
Brunei: Lock the door!
Lock the door! Fuck!

38:28.890 --> 38:31.101
Kim: Seal it up.
Don't let them get out!

38:31.184 --> 38:33.895
Irwin: He's bleeding.
Brunei: Need to seal it.

38:33.979 --> 38:37.524
Irwin: He's got a tear!
He's bleeding.

38:37.607 --> 38:41.236
- Lane: Hold it, hold it, hold it.
- Irwin: You're okay.

38:46.616 --> 38:47.909
Lane: Yeah, I've got it.

38:47.993 --> 38:51.288
- What's Kim doing? She's...
- Kim!

38:51.371 --> 38:53.623
- What the hell are you doing?
- ( grunts )

38:53.707 --> 38:56.918
Vince: Kim!
No, that's the door lock!

38:57.002 --> 39:00.339
Kim, stop!
No, they're still in there!

39:00.422 --> 39:01.840
Get off me. Get off me!

39:01.923 --> 39:04.384
It's okay. You disabled it.
They can't get out.

39:04.468 --> 39:06.970
You don't know what they did!
Look for yourself!

39:17.230 --> 39:19.608
Irwin: Vincent?

39:22.444 --> 39:25.739
What happened to them?
What the hell happened to them?

39:25.822 --> 39:27.949
It's low pressure.
They've got the bends.

39:28.033 --> 39:31.370
When are you guys gonna get it?
It's not them anymore! They're gone!

39:31.453 --> 39:34.790
- ( Banging )
- Fuck!

39:34.873 --> 39:37.584
That door is reinforced steel.
They can't get through.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.420
They have power tools. They have
high explosives! They can get out!

39:40.504 --> 39:42.631
If they drill the door
the decompression'll kill them.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.591
- It won't.
- Lane: Brunei's in a bad way.

39:44.674 --> 39:47.177
- We need to move him now.
- Fuck.

39:47.260 --> 39:48.887
Vince: Let's get him
to the hydroponic dome.

39:48.970 --> 39:52.724
Kim, get the airlock.
Let's go. Now!

39:52.808 --> 39:55.477
- Lane: We're gonna move you now.
- We've gotta go now! Move!

39:55.560 --> 39:58.146
- Come on, skipper, let's go.
- Lane: One, two, three.

39:58.230 --> 40:00.440
- ( Brunei groans )
- Oh, shit!

40:00.524 --> 40:02.818
Lane: Just a little bit.

40:04.277 --> 40:08.073
Vince: Almost there. Come on.

40:08.156 --> 40:10.450
- Come on, you can do it.
- Lane: You're nearly there.

40:14.329 --> 40:15.747
( Air hisses )

40:22.963 --> 40:24.923
- Have you got him?
- Yeah.

40:25.006 --> 40:26.508
Gently, gently.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.677
- Irwin, get out the way.
- Okay, okay.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.846
- Sit him up.
- I'm trying.

40:32.848 --> 40:34.933
- Lane: Careful.
- It's all right.

40:41.440 --> 40:44.860
Okay. One, two, three.
Mind his neck.

40:44.943 --> 40:48.029
- It's okay.
- Gently, gently.

40:48.113 --> 40:51.241
- Vince: There you go.
- ( exhales )

40:53.660 --> 40:57.372
Lane: Captain, stay awake
and focus, okay?

40:57.456 --> 41:01.543
Okay. It's just that...
Nothing feels right inside.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.670
- Lane: I'm gonna give you a shot.
- Doesn't feel right.

41:03.753 --> 41:05.922
Vincent: Gonna give you
some morphine, okay?

41:06.006 --> 41:07.883
Here we go.

41:14.181 --> 41:16.057
Lane: All right.
We've got to get this open.

41:18.310 --> 41:19.978
(winces )

41:22.439 --> 41:24.858
- Lane: Jeez.
- Irwin: Oh, God.

41:28.445 --> 41:30.572
Vincent, I'm not a medic.
I can't do this.

41:30.655 --> 41:33.825
Lane, if anyone can do this, you can.
Just tell me what you need.

41:33.909 --> 41:36.369
Vince: Come on.

41:36.453 --> 41:40.999
Hey, I know that look.
You don't have to...

41:42.042 --> 41:43.793
( groans ) Oh, God.

41:43.877 --> 41:45.629
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41:47.589 --> 41:49.424
There should be more blood.

41:51.676 --> 41:56.723
Six months. What a mess.
I thought we were home free.

42:01.061 --> 42:04.022
What's Kate gonna tell the kids?

42:04.105 --> 42:05.190
Lane: Shh.

42:05.273 --> 42:10.445
I can't... I can't remember
what they look like.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.408
You tell them I was thinking
about them. Do that for me?

42:15.492 --> 42:18.370
I will. Of course.
Of course I will.

42:25.460 --> 42:28.964
We've seen things
that no one has seen before.

42:29.047 --> 42:32.050
They can't take that
away from us, right?

42:32.133 --> 42:33.552
No.

42:36.429 --> 42:38.974
God, I'm thirsty. Thirsty.

42:39.057 --> 42:41.518
- I've got it.
- Thirsty.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.814
Vince: Stay here, skipper.
Come on.

42:45.897 --> 42:47.649
Just breathe.

42:47.732 --> 42:50.735
Nice and easy.
You're gonna be okay.

42:57.742 --> 42:58.785
Okay.

42:58.868 --> 43:02.622
Okay. It's okay, it's me.
It's Irwin. It's okay.

43:02.706 --> 43:05.875
Okay, careful. Careful.

43:09.754 --> 43:12.841
Get some more. Kim, get some more.
Okay. Hey, I'm with you.

43:12.924 --> 43:15.093
You have to... You have to...

43:15.176 --> 43:18.054
You gotta help me.
You gotta help.

43:18.138 --> 43:20.181
' ( Grunts)
- No! Stop!

43:20.265 --> 43:22.225
Vince: Skipper, no! Let go!
Lane:Jesus!

43:22.309 --> 43:25.270
Get off him!
Skipper! Stop! No!

43:26.521 --> 43:29.149
( Brunei shouting )

43:30.358 --> 43:33.695
Look at me! Look at me!

43:33.778 --> 43:38.867
You're okay, you're okay. Come on.
Goddamn it! Stop, please!

43:38.950 --> 43:41.036
- Please. Just look at me.
-(gasps)

43:41.119 --> 43:43.580
It's okay. Just breathe.
Just breathe.

43:43.663 --> 43:44.998
Come on, come on, come on.

43:45.081 --> 43:48.835
Look at me. Look at me, come on.
Please. Come on.

43:48.918 --> 43:51.087
Just breathe. You're okay.

43:51.171 --> 43:52.380
Skipper.

44:05.018 --> 44:07.020
You'll never see home.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.162
What the fuck was that?

44:29.417 --> 44:33.004
He didn't mean that.
He couldn't. He couldn't.

44:44.849 --> 44:46.559
Kim.

44:46.643 --> 44:50.313
- Kim, he's gone.
- Don't touch me.

44:50.397 --> 44:52.440
What the hell are you doing?

44:54.025 --> 44:55.944
You think he's dead, right?

44:56.027 --> 44:59.781
Vincent... Kim, he's gone.

44:59.864 --> 45:01.658
Kim.

45:01.741 --> 45:04.160
Get your hands off him.
Get away from him!

45:04.244 --> 45:06.329
- He has gone.
- Think about it, Irwin.

45:06.413 --> 45:08.707
Marko and Dalby are out there
exposed to the atmosphere

45:08.790 --> 45:11.918
- and they're still moving.
- It can't be how it looks.

45:12.001 --> 45:14.254
There must be
some explanation for this.

45:32.689 --> 45:35.275
( Beeping )

45:35.358 --> 45:38.778
I've had enough of this place.
I just want to go home.

45:41.281 --> 45:43.241
I'm done.

45:44.492 --> 45:46.035
I'm done, Vincent.

45:52.292 --> 45:55.837
He said he couldn't
remember his children.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.173
I just want to see my little girl.

45:58.256 --> 46:00.383
I wanna see Ella.

46:00.467 --> 46:02.260
(sobs)

46:24.657 --> 46:26.659
( rumbling)

46:26.743 --> 46:29.454
( alarm beeps )

46:32.832 --> 46:34.709
Kim: They've blown the dome.
They're out.

46:34.793 --> 46:36.044
Lane: We need to contact
the Aurora.

46:36.127 --> 46:39.631
Comms are down.
Till we fix them, we're trapped.

46:39.714 --> 46:42.175
What about the O2 feed pipe?

46:42.258 --> 46:44.636
It's the only thing
connecting the two domes.

46:44.719 --> 46:48.056
We can get back to the main base
without them even seeing us.

46:48.139 --> 46:50.016
If I can get through
and fix the skylink,

46:50.099 --> 46:52.143
I can reach the Aurora,
and ask for help.

46:52.227 --> 46:55.563
If they've blown the dome,
it won't be pressurized.

46:55.647 --> 46:57.649
There's a seal at both ends.

46:57.732 --> 47:00.193
If I close it behind me here
and equalize the pressure,

47:00.276 --> 47:02.654
it should hold
when I open the other side.

47:02.737 --> 47:06.366
- If it doesn't, we're all dead.
- And what do you suggest?

47:06.449 --> 47:07.951
What about Harrington?

47:08.034 --> 47:10.620
When they blew the dome,
he wasn't wearing a suit.

47:10.703 --> 47:13.206
( Banging)

47:18.002 --> 47:19.712
Are you sure they can't get in?

47:19.796 --> 47:21.256
How the fuck should I know?

47:21.339 --> 47:23.842
The failsafe is designed
to keep the door closed.

47:23.925 --> 47:25.593
( Clanking )

47:39.816 --> 47:43.069
- We need to deal with this now.
- If Harrington has gone,

47:43.152 --> 47:46.948
Vincent's the only one
that can fix the skylink.

47:47.031 --> 47:48.992
He's the only one.

47:53.413 --> 47:55.665
I'm heading back.

47:55.748 --> 47:59.377
- I'm going with you.
- No. There's no point.

47:59.460 --> 48:03.172
What if Marko and Dalby
return to the base?

48:03.256 --> 48:05.216
We'll keep them busy.

48:21.566 --> 48:24.569
Just, uh, close this behind me

48:24.652 --> 48:27.614
and leach off the air at
the other end so it doesn't blow.

48:45.256 --> 48:47.175
Vince: Lane, you copy me?

48:47.258 --> 48:50.178
Lane: I got you.
You're gonna be okay, all right?

48:50.261 --> 48:54.182
Vince: Yeah. You keep Marko and Dalby
on your side and I'll be fine.

48:54.265 --> 48:55.725
Lane: I wasn't talking about them.

48:55.808 --> 48:57.310
Vince: I know.

49:10.698 --> 49:13.117
( Vincent breathes heavily )

49:14.619 --> 49:15.870
Okay.

49:28.841 --> 49:30.760
( Computer beeps )

49:36.307 --> 49:39.060
- Irwin: Jesus, is that...
- Kim: Same as Marko's sample.

49:39.143 --> 49:40.937
Lane: It's infected his bloodstream.

49:45.650 --> 49:47.986
( Groans )

49:52.615 --> 49:54.492
( breathes heavily )

50:32.321 --> 50:33.948
( groans )

50:45.710 --> 50:47.545
Lane".Lane!

50:50.048 --> 50:53.718
Vince: No, stop. No...

50:53.801 --> 50:55.219
Lane: It's okay.

50:55.303 --> 50:58.347
- You're having another attack.
- I can't...

50:58.431 --> 51:01.642
Can you hear me? Vincent.

51:01.726 --> 51:04.687
What happened on the Aurora,
what happened on the way over here,

51:04.771 --> 51:06.397
it's in the past, all right?

51:08.274 --> 51:12.111
- I can't... I can't do it.
- You can do this, okay?

51:12.195 --> 51:15.323
I have seen you build a comm system
out of a fucking shaving kit,

51:15.406 --> 51:18.117
so don't tell me
you can't handle this.

51:18.201 --> 51:20.119
( Chuckles )

51:22.205 --> 51:25.166
They're supposed to test us
for this shit.

51:25.249 --> 51:26.417
Weed out people like me.

51:26.501 --> 51:29.295
You think the rest of us aren't
on the verge of coming unstuck?

51:29.378 --> 51:33.633
Was Marko acting rationally
in the last few days? Was anyone?

51:36.844 --> 51:38.054
You were.

51:38.137 --> 51:39.764
( Scoffs )

51:39.847 --> 51:42.725
if you think I'm handling this
better, then I'm worried about you.

51:42.809 --> 51:45.770
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm barely holding it together.

51:48.648 --> 51:49.816
Vincent.

51:51.859 --> 51:56.489
No matter how tight it gets
in there, I will be with you.

51:58.282 --> 52:00.701
I know. Thanks.

53:02.180 --> 53:03.723
Lane, you still there?

53:03.764 --> 53:05.766
Yeah, I'm here.
Are you at the base?

53:05.892 --> 53:07.560
Yeah.

53:08.895 --> 53:12.773
Something awful happened here.
There's blood everywhere.

53:12.857 --> 53:15.610
We'll try and keep
Marko and Dalby busy.

53:15.693 --> 53:18.446
We're looking for something
to immobilize them with.

53:18.529 --> 53:21.782
OK. I'm gonna try
and get some power up.

53:21.866 --> 53:25.036
Might take a while.
I'll keep you posted.

53:45.181 --> 53:48.059
- It can't be that simple.
- What can't?

53:48.142 --> 53:49.727
Well, it's a bacteria, isn't it?

53:49.810 --> 53:52.063
We've got a whole range
of antibiotics here.

53:52.146 --> 53:54.649
We've got tetracycline,
cephalosporin,

53:54.732 --> 53:56.317
erythromycin, penicillin.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.569
And if they do work,
how do we deliver them?

53:58.653 --> 54:00.821
They're not just gonna stand there
while we inject them.

54:00.905 --> 54:03.491
Decontamination spray,
in the airlock.

54:03.574 --> 54:05.785
We atomize it
in a contained space.

54:05.868 --> 54:07.787
We need to find a way
to test it.

54:34.772 --> 54:36.816
( Broken glass crunching )

55:25.114 --> 55:28.826
Come on. Come on, baby.

55:46.677 --> 55:48.846
Lane: Okay, we've got something.

55:48.929 --> 55:52.308
Blood sample 12 is reacting
to the cephalosporin.

56:01.692 --> 56:03.694
Are we gonna do this or not?

56:11.744 --> 56:14.080
Better hold him steady. Irwin?

56:15.664 --> 56:18.000
Get over here.
For fuck's sake, Irwin.

56:21.504 --> 56:22.505
Hold his head.

56:27.093 --> 56:29.720
No pulse. Here goes.

56:43.734 --> 56:46.987
(grunts)

56:47.071 --> 56:49.281
- Captain...
- Kim: It's just a reflex.

56:49.365 --> 56:51.700
- Maybe he's trying to fight it.
- Brunei's gone, okay?

56:51.784 --> 56:52.952
He's not here anymore.

57:16.559 --> 57:18.561
Fixed and dilated.

57:20.563 --> 57:22.565
Let's test his blood again.

57:23.941 --> 57:26.569
No multiplication.
Almost zero motility.

57:26.652 --> 57:28.946
Kim: You sure this
is gonna work as a vapor?

57:29.029 --> 57:31.782
It works intravenously,
so it has to.

57:36.745 --> 57:39.665
Tantalus base to Aurora.
Do you copy, Aurora?

57:42.293 --> 57:45.379
Tantalus base to Aurora. Mayday,
mayday. Do you copy, Aurora?

57:45.546 --> 57:48.174
Man: This is Aurora,
we copy your mayday.

57:48.174 --> 57:50.301
Christ, you don't know how good
you guys sound.

57:50.384 --> 57:52.636
We've got an emergency
down here. We need...

57:55.806 --> 57:57.641
What the...?

57:58.809 --> 58:00.811
No, "0, no, no, no.

58:05.232 --> 58:06.442
Oh, shit.

58:07.985 --> 58:11.489
They've just given up.
Kim, they're leaving!

58:11.572 --> 58:13.657
They're heading back to base.
I can't see them.

58:18.662 --> 58:21.207
We've got to get them in here, now!

58:33.594 --> 58:34.512
(thudding)

58:42.853 --> 58:45.439
(thudding)

58:45.523 --> 58:48.484
- Oh, please. Kim, Kim.
- ( beeping )

58:49.693 --> 58:51.695
( air hisses )

58:58.911 --> 59:00.788
Get a syringe.

59:00.871 --> 59:02.790
Fuck. Where's Marko?

59:02.873 --> 59:05.417
- Irwin, get a syringe.
- ( Dalby roars )

59:09.129 --> 59:11.131
- Just wait.
- What?

59:11.215 --> 59:14.009
The bacteria's
developing a resistance.

59:14.093 --> 59:15.511
The effect's only temporary.

59:15.594 --> 59:17.471
(thudding)

59:35.781 --> 59:37.908
( grunting softly )

59:44.999 --> 59:46.083
( crackling )

59:51.839 --> 59:54.633
( growls )

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:04.184
- ( growls)
- No, no!

01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:05.811
(Vince groans )

01:00:17.406 --> 01:00:18.532
(yells )

01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:25.789
(grunts)

01:00:28.334 --> 01:00:30.669
Down! Down! Stay down!

01:00:37.384 --> 01:00:40.137
- ( Growls )
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:51.482
(yells )

01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:54.234
Vince: Lane, Harrington's
right behind me!

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:57.488
I couldn't seal the tunnel.
Open the panel!

01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:59.698
He's in the tunnel.
Harrington's after him.

01:01:02.201 --> 01:01:04.161
He hasn't sealed the other end.
Get your helmets on.

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:09.792
( Harrington growls )

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:11.251
Open the panel!

01:01:13.587 --> 01:01:14.880
- Lane: Okay?
- Irwin: Go, go.

01:01:16.048 --> 01:01:17.466
Open the fucking panel!

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.512
(wind howling)

01:01:23.764 --> 01:01:26.350
( muffled ) Vince! Vincent!

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:31.897
( Muffled) Help! Ah!

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:53.711
Kim: Move, move!

01:01:55.337 --> 01:01:57.214
Get out of here. We'll follow.

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:13.105
- Lane: Why won't it open?
- Vince: Failsafe is set to lock

01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:15.816
in case of a breach.
I have to reboot it to get it open.

01:02:38.172 --> 01:02:40.966
- ( Keypad beeps )
- ( muffled ) Please.

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:55.689
Lane: Irwin. Where's Kim?

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:59.193
( Pants ) She didn't make it.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.453
(yells )

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:17.503
Vince: Rover One!
Go! Now! Go! Go!

01:03:20.172 --> 01:03:21.632
Vince: Go!

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:25.511
( Lane gasping )

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:32.893
Don't try and pull it out.
Your suit's breached.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.436
- Come on.
- Irwin: Hurry up!

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:38.148
We need to get to the landing site,
wait for Aurora. Irwin, you drive.

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:43.153
- Irwin: Shit.
- Drive. Just drive.

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:14.893
(sighs ) We need
the med unit at base.

01:04:14.977 --> 01:04:16.228
Dream on.

01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:18.939
We don't have the kit here
to close that up.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:22.484
And you think they'll just
sit there and let you do that?

01:04:22.568 --> 01:04:24.987
What is it, ten hours
till the lander gets here?

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:27.281
How long have we
got in this thing?

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:30.284
Irwin, I need
power and O2 levels.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:31.952
Okay, I'm on it.

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:33.453
We'll be fine.

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:36.832
We'll hole up somewhere
and wait it out.

01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:40.961
What's the point in that?

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:43.881
Stop the infection
before it takes hold.

01:04:43.964 --> 01:04:46.675
Give your body a chance to fight it.

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:58.478
Vincent.

01:04:59.855 --> 01:05:01.356
I know.

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:05.068
It's okay.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:08.572
You're gonna be okay.

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:18.248
There's not enough power
to get to the landing site.

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:25.130
Barely half of what we need.

01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:27.424
We'd have to finish on foot.

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:36.475
No. We have to go back.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:38.936
- What?
- We can't go on foot.

01:05:39.019 --> 01:05:41.772
Lane's hurt. We go back,
we get her patched up.

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:44.191
We can hold 'em off.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:47.486
- There are other options.
- Like what?

01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:55.285
Look, Irwin, if you've got
something to say, just say it.

01:05:57.412 --> 01:06:01.917
You think you should leave me behind
because I might be infected?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.795
That's what you're thinking,
isn't it? Isn't it?

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:07.255
Lane, I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to help here.

01:06:07.339 --> 01:06:09.883
But you might be infected, too.

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:13.804
Brunei touched you.
Let's see your neck.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:16.890
Go on, let's see it.

01:06:16.974 --> 01:06:19.059
- Site Nine.
- What?

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:21.937
We've forgotten about Site Nine.
Rover Two, it's still there.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.772
It's nearly fully charged.

01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:26.233
There's enough power to make it
to the landing site.

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:29.820
( Beeping )

01:06:31.071 --> 01:06:34.157
Vince: Looks like
they're following our tracks.

01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:35.784
Let's get going-

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:40.622
Shit!

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:45.836
Shut down the airlock
and auxiliary cabin power.

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:48.463
( Beeping )

01:06:48.547 --> 01:06:50.173
All right.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.818
Battery's in the red.
This better work.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.875
Vince: I'm gonna go check it out.

01:07:32.632 --> 01:07:35.302
I suppose there's no point
in saying be careful.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:39.306
No. I was planning on taking
a lot of unnecessary risks.

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:42.100
Just don't go
anywhere without me.

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:45.187
No, I'll go.

01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:53.612
I have some
serious making up to do.

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:57.032
Let me do this. Please.

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:18.845
( Breathing heavily )

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:24.059
- ( beeping )
- Vince: Irwin, you copy?

01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:26.520
I'm here, Vincent, I can hear.

01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:28.563
Keep your eyes open-

01:08:28.647 --> 01:08:31.566
if you see anything move,
haul ass back.

01:08:32.317 --> 01:08:33.401
Okay.

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:42.618
(sighs)

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.462
( door creaks )

01:09:16.862 --> 01:09:19.072
( beeping )

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:20.740
Vince: Irwin, can you hear me?

01:09:22.868 --> 01:09:24.493
You okay?

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:27.663
Come on, Irwin.
Can you power it up or not?

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:32.961
Talk to me, Irwin.
What's going on?

01:09:33.044 --> 01:09:35.505
Are we on a private channel?

01:09:35.589 --> 01:09:36.590
Why?

01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:40.176
- How's Lane?
- What do you mean?

01:09:40.218 --> 01:09:44.764
She's infected, Vince.
You need to get out of there.

01:09:44.848 --> 01:09:47.434
It's not gonna happen, Irwin,
so forget about it.

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:49.935
Vincent, you're my friend.

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.439
But you're not thinking clearly
about this.

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:55.192
Do you think this is about me
trying to save my own skin?

01:09:55.275 --> 01:09:57.861
I'm trying to save both of us.
It's too late for her.

01:09:57.944 --> 01:09:59.487
I'll give you three seconds
to get back here.

01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:01.198
- Just leave her!
- One.

01:10:01.281 --> 01:10:03.200
- You're gonna get yourself killed.
- Two.

01:10:03.283 --> 01:10:04.826
- For fuck's sake!
- Three. Shit.

01:10:06.745 --> 01:10:09.289
Irwin's lost it.
I'm going out there.

01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:13.251
(sobs)

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:20.550
( gasping )

01:10:26.348 --> 01:10:29.184
Irwin! I know you can hear me!

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:32.229
Don't do anything stupid. Irwin!

01:10:33.021 --> 01:10:36.149
No! Irwin! Wait!

01:10:37.025 --> 01:10:38.985
Irwin, please, man.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:42.155
Oh, fuck!

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:47.619
Lane: Vincent, they're coming.

01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:57.170
Shit.

01:11:01.216 --> 01:11:03.051
We gotta get outta here. Now!

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:17.857
80 degrees east. Into the storm.
It'll hide our tracks.

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:20.277
We've gotta lose 'em
before the lander.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.987
Battery power is dropping.

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:27.242
(thunder)

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:46.553
So they enter our orbit
in eight hours.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:50.807
That is if they come down immediately
without waiting to hear from us.

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:54.978
- So what are our options?
- Well, wait for dawn.

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:57.647
The sun should charge
the battery in about an hour,

01:11:57.731 --> 01:11:59.607
give us enough juice
to make it to the landing site.

01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:02.527
And what if they track us down
before then?

01:12:03.695 --> 01:12:06.281
Then we'll just have to
run them over...

01:12:06.364 --> 01:12:09.826
...and over and over
until they stop getting up.

01:12:09.909 --> 01:12:12.078
And waste the last
of our power.

01:12:12.162 --> 01:12:15.790
- That is such a shit plan, Vince.
- I know.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:18.835
You got anything better?

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.678
Do you think they still feel?

01:12:31.139 --> 01:12:32.766
No.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.518
Not like us.

01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:43.401
Oh, God. I'm so thirsty.
Do we have any water left?

01:12:43.485 --> 01:12:45.528
Yeah. Let me check.

01:13:05.173 --> 01:13:08.134
We get to the lander, they'll have
a direct line to Mission Control.

01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:11.429
They can help.

01:13:11.513 --> 01:13:14.391
And I always took you
for a pessimist.

01:13:14.474 --> 01:13:17.811
Yeah, well, I like
to keep 'em guessing.

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:27.320
I keep thinking about Brunei.

01:13:30.198 --> 01:13:32.200
I could see him fighting it.

01:13:34.786 --> 01:13:37.205
I keep wondering
if he's still in there.

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:44.003
Trapped inside his own body,
with no control.

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:46.339
Sounds like hell to me.

01:13:49.217 --> 01:13:52.429
Do you think any part of us
survives after death?

01:13:52.512 --> 01:13:54.806
I don't know.

01:13:55.515 --> 01:13:57.267
That's a little bit
above my pay grade.

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:47.192
( Beeping )

01:15:01.039 --> 01:15:02.499
Lane?

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:09.130
Man: This is Aurora broadcasting
on all emergency channels.

01:15:09.214 --> 01:15:12.509
If there is anyone out there, we're
sending an emergency team to help.

01:15:12.592 --> 01:15:15.303
Please respond. Please respond.

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:18.056
This is Campbell to Aurora lander.

01:15:24.437 --> 01:15:27.148
Campbell to Aurora lander.
Come in, Aurora lander.

01:15:27.232 --> 01:15:29.692
- ( Static )
- Come on.

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:37.534
Lane?

01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:41.162
Lane?

01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:45.291
Shit.

01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:01.307
Come on, come on.

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:26.457
Lane. Lane, can you hear me?

01:16:28.126 --> 01:16:30.169
- ( Lane panting )
- Lane, come in.

01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:34.257
Stay back. Stay back.

01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:41.264
No. I'm not gonna do that.
You know I can't do that.

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:45.768
Oh, please. I can't stop it.
I can't stop...

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:50.481
Lane, listen to me.

01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:56.279
We'll find a way.
Okay? I promise you.

01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:59.032
We'll find a way.
Just stop, please.

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:01.159
Please, Lane, just stop.

01:17:02.535 --> 01:17:04.954
- No. Come on.
- ( beeping )

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:11.002
- Lane! Stop!
- ( Lane wheezing )

01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:12.754
Wait!

01:17:14.088 --> 01:17:17.008
Stop! Stop!

01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:20.303
Please! Just stop.

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:23.222
You'll get out and walk
in the end.

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:26.225
On green grass.
Under blue skies, won't you?

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:29.520
We will. We will.

01:17:29.604 --> 01:17:33.441
I really wanted to, Vincent.
I really... I really did want to.

01:17:33.524 --> 01:17:36.611
Lane, listen to me. Just wait.

01:17:36.694 --> 01:17:40.448
- I'm so sorry.
- Just stop. Please!

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:42.617
I'm sorry.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:43.576
No!

01:17:45.536 --> 01:17:47.246
( Gasps )

01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:57.382
Shit! No!

01:17:57.465 --> 01:18:00.468
No! Lane, no.

01:18:02.428 --> 01:18:04.263
( Sobbing )

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:05.807
No!

01:18:07.517 --> 01:18:11.896
No, please. Please. Lane.

01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:13.523
( Sobbing )

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:20.613
No.

01:18:29.288 --> 01:18:30.748
No!

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:36.254
( Vince screams )

01:18:37.422 --> 01:18:39.215
No!

01:18:39.966 --> 01:18:41.384
Lane! Don't!

01:18:50.852 --> 01:18:54.147
Lane! Look at me! Look at me!

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.023
Stop! No!

01:18:57.650 --> 01:19:00.403
- Stop!
- Kill me.

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:02.363
Kill me.

01:19:05.658 --> 01:19:07.702
Kill me.

01:19:30.475 --> 01:19:32.226
( Sobbing )

01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:44.906

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.888
- Shit.
- Man 1: Yes, sir.

01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:11.599

Woman: Cabin pressure cross check.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.320
Aurora lander, please respond.

Woman: Okay, prepare rear hatch

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:30.076
Aurora lander, please respond.
Do not open your bay doors.

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.703
Repeat, do not open
your bay doors.

01:20:32.787 --> 01:20:37.041
Woman: We have ground contact.
Channel Nine clear for contact.

01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:39.710
- Irwin, no!
- Woman: Emergency code seven.

01:20:39.794 --> 01:20:42.547
Stay out of there! No!

01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:44.257
Woman: We have two
unidentified figures.

01:20:44.382 --> 01:20:45.800
Man 2: I'm going out to meet them.

01:20:46.092 --> 01:20:48.261
Woman: Something isn't right here.

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:49.929
They're not responding

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:51.931

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:54.225

( beeping )

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:45.026
(slurping)

01:21:45.776 --> 01:21:47.862
(Vince panting )

01:21:49.906 --> 01:21:51.115
( growls )

01:22:12.261 --> 01:22:14.597
Oh, fuck.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:20.353
Marko.

01:23:02.353 --> 01:23:04.355
( Bay door closes )

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:16.927
My little girl.

01:24:17.011 --> 01:24:21.140
I can't remember her name
anymore... to say goodbye.

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.018
Ella.

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:27.313
Her name is Ella.

01:24:35.863 --> 01:24:40.326
I wanna feel again, Vincent.
I can't feel my hands.

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:42.703
I can't let you do this, Irwin.

01:24:42.787 --> 01:24:47.291
We can't let this get back
to Earth. it has to end here.

01:24:47.374 --> 01:24:49.210
(engines power up)

01:25:00.221 --> 01:25:02.056
( roars )

01:25:11.482 --> 01:25:13.275
(yells )

01:25:28.249 --> 01:25:29.834
(grunts)

01:25:46.016 --> 01:25:47.476
( groans )

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:55.818
(grunts)

01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:59.155
( engines accelerate )

01:26:01.031 --> 01:26:02.324
(yells )

01:26:05.452 --> 01:26:06.537
(yells )

01:26:27.933 --> 01:26:29.185
(yells )

01:26:32.146 --> 01:26:34.523
( silence )

01:27:53.185 --> 01:27:54.520
( beeping )

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:10.077
( exhales )

01:28:49.533 --> 01:28:52.161
( inaudible)

01:28:55.998 --> 01:28:58.876
( gasps )

01:29:49.718 --> 01:29:51.720
Aurora lander to Mission Control.

01:29:54.139 --> 01:29:57.142
This is chief systems officer
Vincent Campbell speaking.

01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:59.395
Uh...

01:30:01.146 --> 01:30:04.358
I don't know how much
you guys know but, uh...

01:30:05.943 --> 01:30:09.947
The entire crew of Tantalus base
was infected by some sort of...

01:30:11.281 --> 01:30:13.283
...virulent bacteria.

01:30:15.744 --> 01:30:19.832
As far as I know, the Aurora
relief team was lost as well.

01:30:19.915 --> 01:30:22.167
( Sighs )
They're gone.

01:30:24.378 --> 01:30:26.380
All of them.

01:30:29.216 --> 01:30:32.136
Lander's in a stable orbit,

01:30:32.219 --> 01:30:35.681
but I don't have enough fuel
to reach the Aurora.

01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:40.686
I've got the, uh, supplies on board
for Tantalus' replacement crew.

01:30:40.769 --> 01:30:42.980
There's a chance
they might last long enough

01:30:43.063 --> 01:30:45.732
for you to send someone
out here, but...

01:30:45.816 --> 01:30:47.234
( chuckles )

01:30:49.653 --> 01:30:51.447
Here's the catch.

01:30:54.032 --> 01:30:56.034
There's a, uh...

01:30:59.037 --> 01:31:01.248
...pretty good chance
I'm infected, too.

01:31:03.459 --> 01:31:05.794
If that's the case,

01:31:05.878 --> 01:31:09.131
I've got just enough fuel left
to drop out of orbit

01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:11.258
and burn up in the atmosphere.

01:31:13.802 --> 01:31:15.804
At least it'll be quick.

01:31:19.808 --> 01:31:22.811
You should get this
in about 15 minutes, so...

01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:25.272
Uh...

01:31:29.735 --> 01:31:32.029
I guess I'll be waiting.

01:31:33.489 --> 01:31:35.699
Five eleven Zulu,
Aurora lander out.

01:31:54.134 --> 01:31:57.012
