WEBVTT

00:18.400 --> 00:20.440
MAN: Mr Philby, you were asked
to resign yourself

00:20.480 --> 00:22.440
from the Foreign Office
a few months after

00:22.480 --> 00:23.880
Burgess and Maclean disappeared.

00:23.920 --> 00:26.160
And the Foreign Secretary
has said that, in the past,

00:26.200 --> 00:28.200
you had communist associations.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.000
Is that WHY you were asked
to resign?

00:30.000 --> 00:30.080
Is that WHY you were asked
to resign?

00:30.120 --> 00:33.280
I was asked to resign
because of an imprudent association.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.080
That was your association
with Burgess? Correct.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.560
Would you still regard Burgess,

00:38.600 --> 00:40.960
who lived with you for a while
in Washington,

00:41.000 --> 00:43.280
would you still regard him
as a friend of yours?

00:43.320 --> 00:45.040
How do you feel about him now?

00:45.080 --> 00:46.520
URINATING

00:46.560 --> 00:49.200
'I consider his action deplorable.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.600
'On the subject of friendship,

00:51.640 --> 00:53.360
'I prefer to say
as little as possible,

00:53.400 --> 00:54.720
'as it's very complicated.'

00:58.920 --> 01:00.000
TOILET FLUSHES

01:00.000 --> 01:00.760
TOILET FLUSHES

01:18.640 --> 01:20.000

01:23.320 --> 01:24.640
Vash kostyoom.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.520
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

01:39.160 --> 01:40.400
Something about him...

01:42.320 --> 01:44.400
Chto?
LIGHTER CLICKS

01:45.880 --> 01:47.280
You know.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.040
IN RUSSIAN:

02:02.560 --> 02:07.640
If the dreaded Windsor knot
has somehow made its way to Russia,

02:07.680 --> 02:10.640
please understand
there are certain things

02:10.680 --> 02:13.040
I just cannot bring myself to do.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.720
Nick?

02:23.080 --> 02:24.240
Darling?

02:26.600 --> 02:28.800
Are you down there?

03:06.600 --> 03:08.040
I'm off.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.600
I made you one cheese and pickle
and one ham.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.760
If I'm late again tonight,
there's a casserole made.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.200
All you have to do is heat it up.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.000
Hey, come 'ere.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.400
You all right?
One more kiss.

04:10.600 --> 04:14.080
Good old British weather.
Never fails.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.120
I was just about to leave for work
meself.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.320
May I come in for a minute?

04:27.720 --> 04:29.520
Morning.
Morning.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.000
Mr Angleton, I have a train
to catch, so, if you wouldn't mind,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.520
Mr Angleton, I have a train
to catch, so, if you wouldn't mind,

04:32.560 --> 04:35.560
just, you know...
getting on with it.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.880
Regarding what we talked about
last night...

04:38.920 --> 04:40.600
It does seem a tad unorthodox,
though.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.360
Coming to my house like this
in broad daylight.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.880
..or, more accurately,
what we didn't talk about...

04:47.920 --> 04:49.880
Would you mind just staying on
the mat?

04:49.920 --> 04:51.240
Dripping all over me floor.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.680
Keep talking, I'm listening.

04:55.560 --> 04:58.160
To answer your question
from last night,

04:58.200 --> 05:00.000
obviously the reason I'm in London

05:00.000 --> 05:00.080
obviously the reason I'm in London

05:00.120 --> 05:03.800
is to keep an eye on our friend,
Mr Nicholas Elliott,

05:03.840 --> 05:07.640
and what he may or may not be up to.
Unofficially?

05:07.680 --> 05:09.000
Excuse me?

05:09.040 --> 05:12.040
Last night, you said you were
in London unofficially.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.200
Right.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.800
Were you unofficially in Beirut...

05:21.080 --> 05:22.800
..as well?
No.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.400
I was not.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.000
CIA... coming all the way up here
to West Norwood.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.920
CIA... coming all the way up here
to West Norwood.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.040
What will my neighbours say?

05:35.480 --> 05:37.560
I thought I might give you a ride
into town.

05:38.640 --> 05:41.200
Mind if I ask you something?
Please.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.200
Would you be doing all this
if I was a man?

05:48.120 --> 05:49.120
Doing what?

05:50.160 --> 05:53.080
I came out here to see
if there was a way for us to...

05:54.280 --> 05:55.880
..work together.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.680
That's all.
Officially or...

06:01.200 --> 06:04.000
..unofficially?
Pool our resources.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.320
Exchange information.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.600
Information?

06:10.640 --> 06:13.240
You don't have anything
you feel it might be...

06:13.280 --> 06:14.720
important to share?

06:17.200 --> 06:19.680
I don't doubt for a moment
that you might be able

06:19.720 --> 06:23.160
to fudge the difference
between "official" and "unofficial",

06:23.200 --> 06:26.520
I can assure you
that I absolutely cannot.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.560
Bloody hell, is that the time?
I need to get a wriggle on.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.520
I'm gonna miss me train.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.000
Fucking Guy fucking Burgess...

07:00.000 --> 07:00.520
Fucking Guy fucking Burgess...

07:00.560 --> 07:04.440
If you think about it,
it's fucking preposterous.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.960
If he and I
were both spying for Russia...

07:10.840 --> 07:12.160
Can't even finish the sentence.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.920
If you were both KGB spies,
why invite him to stay with you?

07:14.960 --> 07:16.480
Exactly, thank you.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.720
And in Washington, of all places.
It'd be plain bloody daft.

07:19.760 --> 07:20.800
Suicidal.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.320
Look at me. Fucking water.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.800
As a matter of interest,
why did you invite Guy to stay?

07:27.840 --> 07:30.000
Bloody hell, not you as well.
It's a valid question, Kim...

07:30.000 --> 07:30.240
Bloody hell, not you as well.
It's a valid question, Kim...

07:30.280 --> 07:33.680
Because friends, I hate to tell you,
help each other in times of need.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.320
..and a question others
are bound to ask.

07:35.360 --> 07:39.280
The man was adrift, dreadful health,
or so I thought...

07:39.320 --> 07:41.960
Hello, Mother.
I thought I heard that voice.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.440
Hello, Mrs P. How are you?
Oh, you know...

07:45.480 --> 07:47.320
There they are.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.640
That's it, didn't mean to interrupt.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.240
One for you, too.
Where are you off to?

07:56.240 --> 07:58.760
Don't let him smoke
that beastly pipe

07:58.800 --> 08:00.000
in my drawing room, Nick.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.280
in my drawing room, Nick.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.960
Leaves horrid smells in my cushions.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.880
Make him go out to the garden.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.640
Hairdresser then Cullen's.
Need anything?

08:08.680 --> 08:11.280
Marmalade, and tonics,
and bitter lemons.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.000
You're a good friend, Nick.

08:16.640 --> 08:18.360
He's jolly lucky to have you.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.960
She have any idea what's going on?
No, not as far as I know.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.960
Hasn't asked why you came back
from America all of a sudden?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Oof, Lord, no.
Far too proper for that.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.480
Oof, Lord, no.
Far too proper for that.

08:31.520 --> 08:34.200
Anyway, the point
I was trying to make is

08:34.240 --> 08:37.280
you are our man in Washington...
I know what you're about to say.

08:37.320 --> 08:40.680
..and amusing and adrift
as Guy might appear...

08:40.720 --> 08:43.320
He'd just arrived in America,
he didn't know a soul,

08:43.360 --> 08:45.440
and I was worried about him.
Because of his drinking?

08:45.480 --> 08:47.440
KIM HUFFS
Among other things.

08:47.480 --> 08:50.360
If I had a drinking problem, I'm not
sure that you're the first person...

08:50.400 --> 08:52.400
You do have a drinking problem.
I think we all do.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.720
It's part of the job.
THEY CHUCKLE

08:59.840 --> 09:00.000
Erm...?

09:00.000 --> 09:00.840
Erm...?

09:02.280 --> 09:03.280
What?

09:04.480 --> 09:05.480
Nothing.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.680
You know, the one kind of chap
you would think

09:10.720 --> 09:13.560
the KGB would steer clear of

09:13.600 --> 09:16.200
is an out-of-control alcoholic,

09:16.240 --> 09:19.480
flagrant queer, like Guy Burgess.
Hm.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.120
Guy did have me
well and truly fooled, though.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.520
That I can't deny.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.000
Ah, well, you twisted my arm.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.440
Ah, well, you twisted my arm.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.120
Completely bloody hoodwinked.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.920
He had us all fooled.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.840
Betraying us to Russia
all that time... Christ, I dunno.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.280
If somebody should've
seen through him, it was me.

09:46.680 --> 09:47.920
I'm so sorry, Kim.

09:57.840 --> 10:00.000
Ten years ago, when they accused me
of helping Maclean and...

10:00.000 --> 10:02.520
Ten years ago, when they accused me
of helping Maclean and...

10:02.560 --> 10:06.200
Burgess, do you remember all that?
Oh, I remember.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.960
Guy fucking Burgess.

10:10.880 --> 10:15.040
You were a good and loyal friend.
You stood by me all the way.

10:15.080 --> 10:19.400
You know, I believed
you were innocent. Why?

10:20.880 --> 10:23.760
Why then and not now?
What's so different now?

10:23.800 --> 10:25.160
Evidence.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.320
From Flora bloody Solomon?

10:29.960 --> 10:30.000
It's not just her.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.200
It's not just her.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.640
What do you mean?
There's someone else.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.320
Who?

10:40.200 --> 10:41.840
A KGB defector.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.400
I don't believe you.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.280
You have no idea
how I wish none of this were true.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.360
Who is this defector?
Hm.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.200
The same source
says you're not the only traitor.

still in play.

Who?
The Americans.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.920
What?

14:42.960 --> 14:44.000
See for yourself.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.640
Are you sure?
Read the telexes first.

How did you get this?
This is Al, by the way.

Hello.
..for an ex copper.

15:05.920 --> 15:09.160
Who else has seen this?
Apart from the FBI and the CIA?

15:09.200 --> 15:12.960
On our side, I mean.
Er... the Director General of MI5,

15:13.000 --> 15:16.880
Head of Counter-Intelligence,
Arthur Martin, Mrs Sissmore...

15:16.920 --> 15:18.560
And me.
..and Al.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.800
Do any of those people know
that you're now showing it to me?

15:22.840 --> 15:24.120
No.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.760
They don't, not as yet.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.200
Thank you.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.560
The one thing we absolutely cannot
afford

15:38.600 --> 15:41.080
is to let the Americans
get to Blunt first,

15:41.120 --> 15:44.160
so we need to smoke him out now,
today,

15:44.200 --> 15:46.920
cos if he isn't
the last of the traitors among us...

15:48.480 --> 15:50.960
..he knows who is.
Philby tell you that?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.600
That's just the way
the business works.

15:52.640 --> 15:56.320
Did he tell you that?
Not in so many words, no.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.520
Do you know him?
Not really.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.000
Vaguely remember him from up
at Cambridge. Long time ago, now.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Vaguely remember him from up
at Cambridge. Long time ago, now.

16:05.760 --> 16:09.240
Not another of your friends, then?
No.

16:15.880 --> 16:19.240
Jim Angleton's far too cautious to
make any rash approaches to Blunt.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.520
If you say so.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.920
You disagree?
He came to my house this morning.

16:24.160 --> 16:27.040
Seriously?
To probe, browbeat.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.200
Don't you think it's odd...

16:29.600 --> 16:31.280
..that as soon as Philby
did a bunk,

16:31.320 --> 16:33.000
hey, presto, this character
pops out of the woodwork in America

16:33.000 --> 16:34.600
hey, presto, this character
pops out of the woodwork in America

16:34.640 --> 16:37.280
to jeopardise the value,
to you, personally,

16:37.320 --> 16:42.000
of the very same intelligence
that Philby gave you in Beirut?

16:45.880 --> 16:47.040
SOFTLY: Rule number one...

16:48.480 --> 16:50.640
If it smells bad
and you suspect the Russians,

16:50.680 --> 16:52.560
it's probably the Russians.

17:20.360 --> 17:22.040
Tovarishch Philby.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.200
Donald!

17:26.720 --> 17:28.360
Hello, Kim!

17:29.680 --> 17:30.800
THEY CHUCKLE

17:33.360 --> 17:36.120
Tovarishch polkovnik.
Donald Donaldavitch.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.560
Their little joke.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.520
You look well.
More to the point, how are you?

17:41.560 --> 17:44.800
I take it this isn't an accident,
meeting you here.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.120
It's the least I could do.

17:47.280 --> 17:51.280
Meaning?
To, er, smooth the way, if you will.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.920
How's Melinda, by the way?

17:54.960 --> 17:57.560
Looking forward
to showing you Moscow.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.440
CAR HORNS HONK

18:16.720 --> 18:18.440
CHATTER

18:35.760 --> 18:37.520
See much of Burgess these days?

18:37.560 --> 18:40.280
I gather he made your life
a little sticky for a while there,

18:40.320 --> 18:41.960
back in London.
DOOR CLOSES

18:42.000 --> 18:43.920
Not to mention Washington.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.120
London, Washington, Moscow.

18:46.160 --> 18:47.920
One of the things one has to love
about the man

18:47.960 --> 18:51.120
is that Burgess will always be
Burgess until the day that he...

18:52.400 --> 18:53.520
Hang on a second.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.280
You haven't come here
to bump him off have you?

18:57.320 --> 19:00.320
How very droll, Don, as always.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.080
CHAIRS SCREECH

19:27.480 --> 19:29.040
Tovarishch Philby.

19:29.080 --> 19:32.960
My rady videt' vas zhivym
i nevredimym v Moskve.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.400
"Welcome to Moscow", and so forth.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.560
Thank you.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.640
SOFTLY: "Spasibo."
Spasibo.

19:41.520 --> 19:45.200
Tovarishch general,
it's very good to be here.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.720
Zdes' khorosho.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.400
Kak vam vasha novaya kvartira?

19:49.440 --> 19:52.600
"How are your new digs?"
Er, fine.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.560
Thank you. Lovely.
Liar.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.520
No, snachala my khoteli
by pogovorit'

19:57.560 --> 20:01.360
o James Jesus Angletoni iz TSRU.

20:02.760 --> 20:03.000
They want to ask you...
MUFFLED: That much I understood.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.680
They want to ask you...
MUFFLED: That much I understood.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.320
SHE CLEARS THROAT

20:11.360 --> 20:13.400
IN RUSSIAN:

20:24.160 --> 20:27.680
IN RUSSIAN:

20:33.400 --> 20:36.640
Not like you to be nervous.
Don't tell anyone.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.040
I've been a nervous wreck
the past 30 years.

20:39.080 --> 20:43.280
MEN: # Upon our clouded hills?

20:43.320 --> 20:49.120
# And was Jerusalem

20:49.160 --> 20:52.360
# Builded here

20:52.400 --> 20:58.400
# Among these dark Satanic mills? #

20:58.440 --> 21:01.840
Mr Milne and his guest are sitting
down in the dining room now, sir.

21:01.880 --> 21:03.000
SOFTLY: Thanks, Frederick.

21:03.000 --> 21:03.040
SOFTLY: Thanks, Frederick.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.840
You'll perhaps forgive me
for being immodest

21:10.880 --> 21:16.320
when I say that it's thanks to
the friendship I d-d-developed

21:16.360 --> 21:19.960
and nurtured over many years
with Angleton...

21:20.000 --> 21:24.440
Prostite za neskromnost',

21:33.000 --> 21:34.760
and extremely detailed
e-e-exchanges in...

21:34.800 --> 21:36.640

21:36.680 --> 21:40.080

21:42.360 --> 21:47.200

at his house in, er, Virginia.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.760
Rasskazhite podrobneye
o cheloveke...

21:49.800 --> 21:52.600
yego lichnosti.
Erm...

21:52.640 --> 21:56.360
They want to know ask you about
his personality, his character.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.520
Well, you must know by now

21:59.560 --> 22:01.960
that all they REALLY care about
these days is the Americans?

22:03.480 --> 22:04.840
Yeah.

22:07.080 --> 22:12.080
'Er, well, first and foremost,
he really is rather an odd bird.'

22:12.120 --> 22:16.240
'Nu, pervoye glavnoye,
chto on dushoy sudak.'

22:16.280 --> 22:18.920
He would like to be regarded
as a poet,

22:18.960 --> 22:23.040
although he has almost
n-no discernible talent whatsoever.

22:24.280 --> 22:27.440
On khochet,
chtoby yego uchityvali poetom.

22:27.480 --> 22:31.280
He is, however,
a gifted intelligence man,

22:31.320 --> 22:33.000
with a keen eye for the...

22:33.000 --> 22:33.520
with a keen eye for the...

22:34.680 --> 22:37.840
..nuances of human behaviour...

22:37.880 --> 22:40.800
except, one could argue,
where I'm concerned.

22:40.840 --> 22:43.120
Vy byli blizkim drugom?

22:44.720 --> 22:46.160
Er, you were close?

22:46.200 --> 22:49.280
Yes, we were close. Of course
we were close, that's the job.

22:49.320 --> 22:52.560
Da, tak bylo nado dlya raboty.

22:52.600 --> 22:57.600
Then he gives a speech
to a women's group out in, um...

22:59.840 --> 23:01.840
..I don't remember where,
which, as it turns out,

23:01.880 --> 23:03.000
was a stroke of genius
on two counts...

23:03.000 --> 23:04.040
was a stroke of genius
on two counts...

23:04.080 --> 23:05.080
PHONE RINGS

23:05.120 --> 23:09.480
..count one, he's right.
We haven't been paying attention...

23:09.520 --> 23:11.160
PHONE RINGS

23:13.480 --> 23:16.440
..and now the communists
are in and among us,

23:16.480 --> 23:20.560
and in far greater numbers
than we ever imagined possible.

23:20.600 --> 23:24.400
So, now, it is our moral,
that's his word,

23:24.440 --> 23:28.400
it's our moral duty as Americans
who stand for democracy

23:28.440 --> 23:31.160
and freedom to stop them.
JIM CHUCKLES

23:31.200 --> 23:33.000
Smoke them out, hunt them down,
before it's too late. Mm.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.880
Smoke them out, hunt them down,
before it's too late. Mm.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.440
Sir, it's...
Count two...

23:38.480 --> 23:43.000
for a man who was in
the political wilderness last week,

23:43.040 --> 23:44.800
well, let's just say, today,

23:44.840 --> 23:48.760
Senator Joe McCarthy is all anyone
in this town is talking about.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.200
Yes, Lucy.
Your office, Sir.

23:52.880 --> 23:53.960
"Urgent", he said.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.720
This is Angleton.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.960
SOFTLY: North Korea just invaded
South Korea.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.760
Fucking hell.

24:14.200 --> 24:15.480
Comrade Philby.

24:17.560 --> 24:24.040
We know very well, here, the fickle
nature of men in your profession,

24:24.080 --> 24:28.240
who are often, in my experience,

24:28.280 --> 24:31.040
driven equally, if not more so,
by...

24:32.160 --> 24:33.000
..opportunity... and ego...

24:33.000 --> 24:35.280
..opportunity... and ego...

24:36.480 --> 24:37.840
..as by ideology.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.000
A German accent?

24:41.680 --> 24:42.680
Dresden.

24:45.280 --> 24:47.280
How can we be sure
you have not come to Moscow

24:47.320 --> 24:49.800
to penetrate
Russian intelligence services?

24:53.560 --> 24:57.440
Yes, Her Majesty's first love
is her horses, not art.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.880
In fact, art doesn't even place
a distant second...

25:02.040 --> 25:03.000
..so all one can really do
is one's best to educate.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.800
..so all one can really do
is one's best to educate.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.400
I rather think I fancy
a nice piece of fish today.

25:11.800 --> 25:15.560
Awfully sorry about all this, Tony.
Sorry about what?

25:15.600 --> 25:16.640
Where're you going?

25:21.320 --> 25:23.280
Beef Wellington's the ticket here,
old fruit...

25:25.320 --> 25:26.880
..followed by Baked Alaska for pud.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.000
Don't worry, it's just us.
You can relax.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.480
Don't worry, it's just us.
You can relax.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.480
Then why have Tim ask me to lunch?

25:38.520 --> 25:41.320
Well, I was rather worried
you might not accept my invitation

25:41.360 --> 25:43.280
after my faux pas the other day.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.880
Faux pas?
Vermehre?

25:48.320 --> 25:49.440
Vermehren?

25:59.880 --> 26:01.880
Have you ever killed anyone, Tony?

26:03.240 --> 26:04.400
What's going on, Nick?

26:04.440 --> 26:05.960
I mean...

26:06.000 --> 26:08.680
have you ever got
actual blood on your hands?

26:09.880 --> 26:13.280
Not like the way we more
sophisticated types prefer to do it,

26:13.320 --> 26:16.560
with the gathering of information
and spreading of disinformation.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.920
SOFTLY: That's what I wanted to do
in Beirut the other day.

26:27.400 --> 26:30.520
Stick a knife in Kim's gut
and watch him bleed to death.

26:37.440 --> 26:38.600
WAITER: Gentlemen?

26:42.640 --> 26:44.360
You're really having the fish?

27:25.200 --> 27:27.480
Your man better be as good
as you say he is.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.320
Mm...

27:34.360 --> 27:36.240
SHE MUMBLES,
ENGINE STARTS

27:37.600 --> 27:40.880
May I ask, did you really
slip on the ice

27:40.920 --> 27:42.920
as you were walking to the car
this morning?

27:44.000 --> 27:45.160
Why would I fake that?

27:45.200 --> 27:47.840
The same reason
you manufacture a stutter.

27:47.880 --> 27:50.240
I slipped. It was real.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.360
And the stutter?

27:52.400 --> 27:55.560
I've had that for so long now,
it's become second nature.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.840
Comrade Philby...

27:58.880 --> 28:00.960
you have come to Moscow
with nothing.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
No documents
or useful information of any kind.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.200
No documents
or useful information of any kind.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.760
I had a very narrow window
of escape.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.080
There was no time
for anything like that.

28:11.120 --> 28:14.120
Thanks to Mr Nicholas Elliott.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.360
I'm not sure I understand
exactly what you mean.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.560
Then I'll be clear.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.280
We're concerned
that either he has played you

28:21.320 --> 28:22.920
or you are playing us.

28:24.120 --> 28:25.520
You don't trust me.

28:25.560 --> 28:26.920
We don't know you.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.720
You've known me for 30 years.

28:36.320 --> 28:38.200
Can I borrow your lighter again?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.760
Needless to say...

29:12.480 --> 29:14.560
..I wouldn't dream of coming
to Moscow empty handed.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.400
One should never underestimate
the importance of a good umbrella.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.960
It's three and a half hours now.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.120
What if he does nothing?
He can't afford to do nothing.

30:24.760 --> 30:27.120
Kim once gave me one, you know?

30:27.160 --> 30:29.800
Pardon?
An umbrella.

30:32.040 --> 30:35.880
For Christmas. Eight years ago.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.000
To thank me for my part
in convincing the Foreign Secretary,

30:37.000 --> 30:38.640
To thank me for my part
in convincing the Foreign Secretary,

30:38.680 --> 30:41.360
and consequently, the Government,

30:41.400 --> 30:43.120
that he had absolutely nothing to do

30:43.160 --> 30:46.200
with Burgess and Maclean's
escape to Moscow.

30:46.240 --> 30:49.600
And that nor was there
the remotest possibility

30:49.640 --> 30:52.000
that he was working...

30:52.040 --> 30:54.680
as a Soviet double agent.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.440
Do you still have it?

30:59.040 --> 31:00.360
The umbrella.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.600
DOOR SLAMS

31:31.040 --> 31:33.400
GUARD: Sorry, Sir Anthony.
I didn't know you were in here.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.680
Is everything all right, sir?

31:42.560 --> 31:45.440
You awake?
No.

31:45.480 --> 31:49.120
There's this moment
between you and Philby in Beirut...

31:50.520 --> 31:55.000
..when he quotes a poem
for apparently no reason.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.120
Yes?

31:56.160 --> 31:58.760
Do you know the poem?

31:58.800 --> 32:01.040
It's about Jesus on the cross.

32:01.080 --> 32:04.680
The Ballad Of The Goodly Fare
by Ezra Pound.

32:04.720 --> 32:07.000
I looked it up.

32:07.000 --> 32:07.120
I looked it up.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.280
Never even heard of it
until last night.

32:09.320 --> 32:11.680
Kim wanted me to think he was drunk

32:11.720 --> 32:15.040
and comparing his own sacrifices
for mankind with those of Jesus.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.440
You know who's friends
with Ezra Pound?

32:18.480 --> 32:19.960
But what he was in fact doing

32:20.000 --> 32:22.760
was sending James Angleton
a message.

32:24.040 --> 32:28.040
Because he knew that the room
in Beirut had to have been bugged

32:28.080 --> 32:29.760
and that the CIA
were either listening

32:29.800 --> 32:31.840
or would procure the tape later.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.080
He had me at first, though.

32:36.960 --> 32:37.000
I really did think
he was comparing himself to Jesus.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.440
I really did think
he was comparing himself to Jesus.

32:42.520 --> 32:45.080
Then, when I thought it through
later,

32:45.120 --> 32:47.040
like you obviously have -
well done, by the way.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.320
Are you being facetious?

32:49.360 --> 32:51.200
No, I don't think so.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.960
Not this time.

32:57.520 --> 32:59.640
What message was Philby sending?

33:01.120 --> 33:03.360
If I know Kim,

33:03.400 --> 33:07.000
he worked very hard over the years
to fool Angleton into believing

33:07.000 --> 33:07.400
he worked very hard over the years
to fool Angleton into believing

33:07.440 --> 33:09.800
that if he ever should defect
to Moscow one day,

33:09.840 --> 33:13.120
that it would
in fact be as a CIA asset.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.080
What do you mean, "If you know Kim"?

33:18.760 --> 33:20.240
Turn of phrase.

33:37.680 --> 33:40.840
Yes, I need to order a taxi
at Queen's Gallery gate, please.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.840
BELLS TOLL

34:07.800 --> 34:09.280
CHATTER

34:42.560 --> 34:45.520
Don't get up.
Crikey.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.720
The peasants they let in here
these days.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.560
Guy.

35:01.920 --> 35:04.440
Plant's on the move in a taxi.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.680
We intercepted the call
and sent Jock in there.

35:06.720 --> 35:07.000
He also just called someone
at an untraceable exchange...

35:07.000 --> 35:10.400
He also just called someone
at an untraceable exchange...

35:10.440 --> 35:11.640
for all of 12 seconds.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.560
That'll be someone
from his KGB network.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Head to Regent's Park, please.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.200
You can speak your mind here, Kim.

35:48.360 --> 35:50.760
Clear the air, I always say.

35:53.560 --> 35:55.000
Well...

35:56.560 --> 36:00.200
Maclean was the one
who was blown in '51, not you.

36:01.880 --> 36:03.800
You were never in any danger.

36:03.840 --> 36:07.000
All I asked you to do
was get a message to him.

36:07.000 --> 36:07.080
All I asked you to do
was get a message to him.

36:07.120 --> 36:08.240
To warn him.

36:09.280 --> 36:11.920
Not to bloody run off
to Moscow with him.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.080
Maybe I wanted to run.

36:17.360 --> 36:19.400
And leave me in the firing line.

36:19.440 --> 36:22.320
Maybe I'd had enough of England...

36:22.360 --> 36:24.280
and all its little hypocrisies.

36:24.320 --> 36:27.000
Or perhaps, you were running out
of navvies to bugger, hm?

36:27.040 --> 36:31.080
To the glorious Soviet navy
and their big new submarines.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.320
That's enough, comrade.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.000
Change subject.

36:37.000 --> 36:37.400
Change subject.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.360
BARMAN: Whiskey?

36:43.000 --> 36:44.880
So...

36:44.920 --> 36:47.760
How is poor old Nick Elliott
faring these days?

36:51.080 --> 36:54.160
I imagine he must be feeling
pretty bloody raw, poor sod.

36:55.320 --> 36:56.480
He'll live.

36:56.520 --> 36:59.280
To find that your dearest friend
was in fact anything but.

37:01.040 --> 37:03.080
That's a proper old kick
in the goolies.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.000
It's so lovely to see you again,
Guy.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.440
It's so lovely to see you again,
Guy.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.040
To old friends.

37:17.720 --> 37:19.880
I need to point Percy
at the porcelain.

37:40.720 --> 37:41.920
DOOR CLOSES

37:43.560 --> 37:45.720
I hear it went well today.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.360
At the Lubyanka.

37:58.800 --> 38:02.520
You don't honestly expect them to
ever fully trust you again, do you?

38:05.120 --> 38:07.000
Because no matter how hard you try
or what you do to impress them,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.440
Because no matter how hard you try
or what you do to impress them,

38:09.480 --> 38:11.200
you won't.

38:12.920 --> 38:14.920
You're not a communist.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.240
You're a spy.

38:19.680 --> 38:22.840
Someone who befriends and betrays...

38:24.160 --> 38:26.800
..seduces and infects.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.880
You and I were born that way,
it's how we're built.

38:34.280 --> 38:37.000
All fine and dandy when you're
over there among friends.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.240
All fine and dandy when you're
over there among friends.

38:43.040 --> 38:44.920
And now you're here...

38:47.600 --> 38:49.360
..it's finished.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.120
Termine.

38:57.200 --> 38:59.760
Take it from me,

38:59.800 --> 39:01.640
all that's left now...

39:02.800 --> 39:04.640
..is their vodka.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.480
I am a communist.

39:09.520 --> 39:12.240
Oh, come here you silly old...

39:12.280 --> 39:15.080
Ow! Ooh, oh!

39:19.080 --> 39:20.960
GUY GROANS

39:25.000 --> 39:27.880
You shouldn't have run when you did.

39:27.920 --> 39:30.400
I never recovered from that.

39:34.280 --> 39:36.080
You ruined everything.

41:49.520 --> 41:51.200
BELL DINGS

42:13.200 --> 42:14.760
Is that someone?

42:24.840 --> 42:26.200
DOOR CLOSES

43:10.400 --> 43:12.640
IN RUSSIAN:

43:21.040 --> 43:23.640
Dobryy vecher.
Kak proshlo na lubyanke?

43:25.400 --> 43:29.800
Lu-byan-ka?
Ah, yes, er, jolly good.

43:29.840 --> 43:32.240
Jolly good, thank you.

43:58.600 --> 44:00.840
We're getting on this one.

44:39.240 --> 44:41.040
Fares, please.

44:50.240 --> 44:53.760
Any more fares, please?
Any more fares?

46:15.240 --> 46:16.720
SIGHS

46:22.600 --> 46:25.280
IN RUSSIAN:

46:38.640 --> 46:41.240
MORSE CODE BEEPS

46:47.080 --> 46:48.320
It's on.

46:49.960 --> 46:52.960
We now have a man in the KGB.

46:56.920 --> 46:59.160
What did I tell you?

47:03.720 --> 47:05.120
BELL DINGS

47:07.600 --> 47:09.400
Next stop, Embankment!

47:33.240 --> 47:34.600
BELL DINGS

47:38.760 --> 47:41.560
Ten years ago,
when MI5 suspected Philby

47:41.600 --> 47:43.000
of helping Burgess and Maclean
escape to Moscow,

47:43.000 --> 47:44.240
of helping Burgess and Maclean
escape to Moscow,

47:44.280 --> 47:49.600
you, as I recall,
were his staunchest ally.

47:49.640 --> 47:51.080
So I'll say it again.

47:51.120 --> 47:54.840
"Sending you to Beirut
would be a colossal mistake."

48:50.200 --> 48:52.200
IN RUSSIAN:

48:52.240 --> 48:53.240
Nyet, nyet, nyet, nyet!

48:53.280 --> 48:55.680
Brosit oruzhiye!

48:55.720 --> 48:57.000
Brosit oruzhiye!

48:57.040 --> 48:58.440
GUNFIRE

49:20.680 --> 49:22.560
MUFFLED VOICES

49:32.080 --> 49:33.840
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

49:38.120 --> 49:41.440
There were two of them,
a man and a woman.

49:42.800 --> 49:43.000
The woman refused to be taken alive.
That's not what's supposed to...

49:43.000 --> 49:45.920
The woman refused to be taken alive.
That's not what's supposed to...

49:47.480 --> 49:50.200
You don't kill them!
You watch them.

49:50.240 --> 49:52.560
You feed them false information,
disinformation.

49:52.600 --> 49:55.160
Sometimes, it's better
to send a strong message. Why?

49:56.280 --> 50:01.160
She gave me a CIA safe house
location here in Moscow.

50:01.200 --> 50:03.000
Fucking hell!

50:03.040 --> 50:07.840
That's 20 fucking years' work
you people have just incinerated!

50:32.240 --> 50:34.080
Where's the vodka?

50:40.720 --> 50:42.040
What?

51:10.880 --> 51:12.280
I'm your friend.

51:16.040 --> 51:18.240
We are your friends.

51:35.120 --> 51:37.480
I gave them a gold mine.

51:39.320 --> 51:42.400
A gold mine. A CIA safe house.

51:44.240 --> 51:48.640
And this is what they do.
This is how you... treat me.

51:56.880 --> 51:59.400
You are a Soviet hero.

52:24.280 --> 52:27.640
ELLIOTT: Now I know why you tried
so hard to stop me going to Beirut.

52:27.680 --> 52:28.960
What?

52:30.640 --> 52:32.320
You'd better sit.

52:40.680 --> 52:42.320
Saveloy and chips, please.

52:57.520 --> 52:59.320
Oh, fuck it.
