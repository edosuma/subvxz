WEBVTT

00:50.067 --> 00:51.536
Can we watch "Star Wars"
tonight?

00:51.536 --> 00:54.408
Yes. Yes, we can absolutely
watch "Star Wars."

00:54.408 --> 00:57.215
I need to choose a charity
for my mitzvah project.

00:57.215 --> 00:58.518
Oh, yeah.
Right, right, right.

00:58.518 --> 01:02.593
Um, maybe something--
something with animals?

01:02.593 --> 01:04.261
That's a good idea. Yeah.

01:04.261 --> 01:05.531
Dogs.
Rescue?

01:05.531 --> 01:06.834
Yeah.
I can do rescue.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.436
Oh, that's a good idea.
We'll look it up.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.006
And speaking of, uh, projects,
how are you feeling

01:10.006 --> 01:11.710
with your STEM project,
Sol?

01:11.710 --> 01:13.413
<i>In the days that followed,</i>

01:13.413 --> 01:16.285
<i>Toby found his thoughts
returning to the museum.</i>

01:16.285 --> 01:18.423
<i>But not to Vantablack.</i>

01:18.423 --> 01:20.595
<i>To his favorite permanent exhibit,</i>

01:20.595 --> 01:22.865
<i>the Hall of Human Origins.</i>

01:24.970 --> 01:26.673
<i>Once, we had no language.</i>

01:26.673 --> 01:28.611
<i>Just the raw materials
of a heartbeat,</i>

01:28.611 --> 01:31.416
<i>some body hair,
and a couple of thumbs.</i>

01:31.416 --> 01:32.919
<i>And then we walked.</i>

01:32.919 --> 01:34.288
<i>And then we cooked.</i>

01:34.288 --> 01:35.992
<i>And then we sent our children
to camp.</i>

01:35.992 --> 01:38.931
<i>And then we had iPhones
and schools and hospitals</i>

01:38.931 --> 01:40.467
<i>and toenail clippers.</i>

01:40.467 --> 01:42.839
<i>Humans were built for survival.</i>

01:42.839 --> 01:46.312
<i>He'd forgotten that
this summer.</i>

01:46.312 --> 01:49.787
<i>But now he remembered.</i>

01:49.787 --> 01:52.091
<i>To survive is to evolve.</i>

01:52.091 --> 01:55.731
<i>To evolve is to move forward.</i>

01:55.731 --> 01:59.038
<i>And to move forward
is to recover.</i>

02:06.720 --> 02:09.960
<i>His recovery was slow at first.</i>

02:09.960 --> 02:11.997
I got the kids an appointment
to see a therapist.

02:11.997 --> 02:13.634
You know, they need
to speak to someone.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.504
They're too worried about me,
and I feel like

02:15.504 --> 02:17.743
they can't really be honest
with how they feel, you know?

02:17.743 --> 02:20.214
Yeah.
I'm not a go-to-therapy guy,

02:20.214 --> 02:23.253
but I think
you should go to therapy.

02:23.253 --> 02:25.624
These shades are, like,
melded to the wall.

02:25.624 --> 02:27.061
No, I know.
It's insane.

02:27.061 --> 02:28.263
Honestly, I don't even know, like,

02:28.263 --> 02:29.632
what talking
would do anymore.

02:29.632 --> 02:31.035
I believe in therapy,
don't get me wrong.

02:31.035 --> 02:32.839
I saw someone right after
we got separated.

02:32.839 --> 02:34.743
But, I don't know, I want to,
like, move into the future

02:34.743 --> 02:38.182
and I can't do that if I keep
talking about the past.

02:41.824 --> 02:45.497
Toby, for real,
man, I can't remove these.

02:45.497 --> 02:49.205
They're, like, welded into
the skeleton of the building.

02:49.205 --> 02:50.709
The building will not
let them go.

02:50.709 --> 02:52.444
"I'm nothing
without you, blinds."

02:52.444 --> 02:54.181
"Not without my blinds."
"You want my blinds?"

02:54.181 --> 02:57.722
"You can't
handle my blinds!"

02:57.722 --> 02:59.158
Hey.
Yeah?

02:59.158 --> 03:01.262
Uh, so I've been meaning
to tell you.

03:01.262 --> 03:03.499
Yeah?

03:03.499 --> 03:05.638
I'm gonna pop
the question.

03:05.638 --> 03:07.542
I'm sorry.
Wait, what?

03:07.542 --> 03:09.746
Yes. I've been thinking
about it a lot.

03:09.746 --> 03:12.017
The day, uh, Vanessa
and I watched Bubbles,

03:12.017 --> 03:14.657
I got this text from
a headhunter, and she saw it,

03:14.657 --> 03:16.192
and, so,
I told her everything.

03:16.192 --> 03:17.929
And it was all fine.

03:17.929 --> 03:20.267
She understood.
She wasn't angry.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.805
And I thought, like,
"Ugh, what kind of person

03:22.805 --> 03:24.275
doesn't want that,"
you know?

03:24.275 --> 03:26.179
Like, I get it now.

03:26.179 --> 03:27.515
Sorry, I'm just, like,
so surprised.

03:27.515 --> 03:29.418
Like, I don't know.
I just got here.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.155
We were going to have, like,
so much fun together.

03:31.155 --> 03:32.391
Yeah.
It was that night,

03:32.391 --> 03:33.995
but, you know, uh,
my life is empty

03:33.995 --> 03:36.065
and I feel like I'm getting
more and more desperate.

03:36.065 --> 03:37.334
You are not desperate.

03:37.334 --> 03:38.538
You are, like,
the king of the city.

03:38.538 --> 03:40.040
You're, like, the king
of the night.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.278
No, I'm just a guy who's getting
older and hasn't settled.

03:42.278 --> 03:43.748
And, you know,
I would like a place.

03:43.748 --> 03:45.752
I would like to belong
to people.

03:45.752 --> 03:47.822
Really? Well, I don't.
I mean, I did and I don't.

03:47.822 --> 03:51.228
Marriage is, like,
no guarantee of anything.

03:51.228 --> 03:53.768
You still have a family,
you know?

03:53.768 --> 03:55.470
I kept looking
at you that night

03:55.470 --> 03:58.376
and thinking how lucky
you were to have a family.

03:58.376 --> 04:01.884
And wondering what my life
might look like to you.

04:01.884 --> 04:02.952
Uh, amazing.

04:02.952 --> 04:05.090
Like, it looked amazing.
It was amazing.

04:05.090 --> 04:06.392
Yeah.

04:06.392 --> 04:08.163
I guess I don't know
that I want to be the guy

04:08.163 --> 04:10.535
that you save for a night out
when you need it, you know?

04:10.535 --> 04:11.937
That's not what
I was saying.

04:11.937 --> 04:13.139
I know.
I know.

04:13.139 --> 04:15.277
But those guys are, like,
10 years younger than me.

04:15.277 --> 04:16.680
More, even.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.551
And Brian's going to marry
the next person he dates.

04:18.551 --> 04:19.886
That's how that is.

04:19.886 --> 04:21.422
And I'm just going to be
this guy that, you know,

04:21.422 --> 04:24.428
you can't really pin down.
I'm suspect.

04:24.428 --> 04:26.298
Look at me, I'm divorced.
I mean, this is--

04:26.298 --> 04:27.702
Yeah, but you still
made it through.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.806
You passed some sort of
vetting process.

04:29.806 --> 04:32.579
At some point in time, you were
part of the establishment.

04:32.579 --> 04:34.014
And you still are.

04:34.014 --> 04:36.219
And I'm just here still worried
about getting invited

04:36.219 --> 04:37.655
to Thanksgiving dinner.

04:37.655 --> 04:38.991
Well, I'll invite you
to Thanksgiving dinner.

04:38.991 --> 04:40.528
No, I have plenty
of invitations.

04:40.528 --> 04:43.432
But they do require me
being wantable, you know?

04:43.432 --> 04:45.203
And I'm saying that that is not
the same thing

04:45.203 --> 04:46.573
as belonging somewhere.

04:46.573 --> 04:49.178
I have no unconditional
invitations in my life.

04:49.178 --> 04:50.413
Hmm.

04:50.413 --> 04:52.250
You could be happy for me.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.987
I was happy for you.

04:55.925 --> 04:58.262
I'm sorry, man.
I don't know what to say.

04:58.262 --> 04:59.533
I can't do this.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.868
No, I know.
I tried all day.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.337
It actually brought
me great shame

05:02.337 --> 05:05.310
to even call you for help.

05:05.310 --> 05:06.947
Do you think,
if we were Gentiles,

05:06.947 --> 05:08.015
we could pull this off?

05:08.015 --> 05:09.484
I don't know.
Maybe Bubbles could do it.

05:09.484 --> 05:10.888
Bubbles, you're not Jewish,
are you?

05:10.888 --> 05:12.759
I won't be shamed by you, Bubbles.

05:12.759 --> 05:14.194
We should be able
to do this.

05:14.194 --> 05:15.799
I know. I think we should be
able to do this, too.

05:15.799 --> 05:17.167
You know who could do it?
Jesus.

05:17.167 --> 05:18.837
Jesus was a carpenter.
People often forget

05:18.837 --> 05:21.275
that he was Jewish.
I don't.

05:21.275 --> 05:23.981
I don't ever forget it.

05:23.981 --> 05:26.052
<i>He was starting to get
some kind of equilibrium.</i>

05:26.052 --> 05:28.524
None of
my friends are there.

05:28.524 --> 05:29.860
Hey.
How was it?

05:29.860 --> 05:32.799
Hi.
I hate the Y camp.

05:32.799 --> 05:33.968
Yeah?

05:33.968 --> 05:36.205
- Hi, Bubbles.
- Hi, Bubbles.

05:36.205 --> 05:37.875
Hey, Bubbles.
Hi, Bubbles.

05:37.875 --> 05:39.546
Can we study
for my haftarah?

05:39.546 --> 05:41.048
Yes, please.
Go get it.

05:41.048 --> 05:43.854
Okay. Come on, Bubbles.
Let's go study.

05:43.854 --> 05:45.658
"'We hold these truths
to be self-evident!'

05:45.658 --> 05:47.829
she shouted.
'That all men are created equal,

05:47.829 --> 05:49.331
that they are endowed
by their creator

05:49.331 --> 05:51.570
with certain
unalienable rights.

05:51.570 --> 05:53.841
But that's exactly
what we have on Camazotz.

05:53.841 --> 05:56.780
Complete equality.
Everybody exactly alike.'

05:56.780 --> 05:59.084
For a moment, her brain
reeled with confusion.

05:59.084 --> 06:01.724
Then came a moment
of blazing truth.

06:01.724 --> 06:03.994
'No!' she cried triumphantly.

06:03.994 --> 06:07.368
'Like and equal are not
the same thing at all!'"

06:07.368 --> 06:09.873
Do you think
everyone is equal?

06:09.873 --> 06:12.879
Um, yeah.
Of course I do.

06:12.879 --> 06:14.916
But you don't like
Mom's friends.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.555
N-No, Mom's friends
are the ones

06:17.555 --> 06:19.057
that don't think
everyone is equal.

06:19.057 --> 06:21.429
That's-- That's why
I didn't like them.

06:21.429 --> 06:22.799
You still think
they're bad.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.535
Okay, you know,

06:24.535 --> 06:26.907
you think maybe
it's time to go to sleep?

06:26.907 --> 06:29.245
Is the spot
getting bigger, Dad?

06:29.245 --> 06:31.315
<i>He'd been finding his old equanimity</i>

06:31.315 --> 06:32.552
<i>poking through again.</i>

06:32.552 --> 06:33.987
Would you look at that?

06:33.987 --> 06:35.691
It kind of looks a little
like Saturn, doesn't it?

06:35.691 --> 06:38.597
Right, but is it okay for it
to be getting bigger?

06:42.437 --> 06:44.976
Yeah, it's fine.

06:44.976 --> 06:48.817
<i>He was starting to return
to his resting pulse again.</i>

06:48.817 --> 06:51.924
"A picture flashed into her mind
of winter evenings

06:51.924 --> 06:53.828
spent sitting before
the open fire

06:53.828 --> 06:55.898
and studying
with her father."

06:55.898 --> 06:58.403
<i>He had been figuring out
what he wanted.</i>

07:05.685 --> 07:07.354
Well, hello, hello.

07:07.354 --> 07:09.191
Hi.
N-N-N-N-No.

07:09.191 --> 07:11.295
Unh-unh.
I'm taking you out, okay?

07:11.295 --> 07:13.166
Toby.
No, it doesn't have
to be to eat.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.372
It can be a walk to the water
or a run to the bodega.

07:16.372 --> 07:17.909
It is really nice outside.

07:17.909 --> 07:19.478
Come on, don't you want to get
the hell out of here?

07:19.478 --> 07:20.882
Are you crazy?
It is not nice.

07:20.882 --> 07:23.085
It is 300°°. Come in.
I was going to order sushi.

07:23.085 --> 07:25.257
No, let's go out. We can eat
sushi in public, okay?

07:25.257 --> 07:27.762
Let's throw caution to the wind
and just be two

07:27.762 --> 07:29.331
consenting adults
eating dinner.

07:29.331 --> 07:30.768
Toby, I can't.

07:30.768 --> 07:33.306
Sorry. I don't think you know,
like, how badly

07:33.306 --> 07:35.644
I need something to be normal
right now, okay?

07:35.644 --> 07:37.615
I do.
But, you know, my husband.

07:37.615 --> 07:38.918
Yeah, he's not
your husband anymore.

07:38.918 --> 07:40.320
Toby.
No, he's not your hu--

07:40.320 --> 07:42.023
He doesn't get to be
your husband after you split up.

07:42.023 --> 07:44.394
Can we just talk inside?
No, sorry.

07:44.394 --> 07:45.798
Uh, I don't--
I don't know.

07:45.798 --> 07:49.171
This is, like, so strange, Nahid.

07:49.171 --> 07:51.175
Sorry. A relationship that
starts in bed.

07:51.175 --> 07:52.712
Usually, it's hard to get
a woman in bed,

07:52.712 --> 07:54.749
not to get her
to go out to dinner.

08:00.661 --> 08:02.665
I don't think this is
working out.

08:06.139 --> 08:07.374
Okay.

08:07.374 --> 08:10.514
Yeah, just, like, I want
something real, you know?

08:10.514 --> 08:13.086
I...

08:13.086 --> 08:16.024
No, I-- I deserve
something real.

08:17.662 --> 08:19.431
I know.

08:19.431 --> 08:21.235
I'm sorry.

08:21.235 --> 08:22.404
You're very nice.

08:22.404 --> 08:24.408
It is just
too complicated.

08:24.408 --> 08:25.844
Yeah.

08:25.844 --> 08:28.517
Toby.
I like you.

08:28.517 --> 08:31.255
Yeah, I like you, too.

08:31.255 --> 08:34.061
Maybe one day.

08:34.061 --> 08:38.035
I'm hoping for more immediate
relief than that,

08:38.035 --> 08:39.605
but...

08:41.308 --> 08:43.112
No.

08:48.223 --> 08:50.728
<i>He was learning
to set boundaries.</i>

09:01.181 --> 09:02.685
<i>And then...</i>

09:06.392 --> 09:07.796
<i>"Dr. Bartuck would like to see</i>

09:07.796 --> 09:10.433
<i>you first thing
in his office."</i>

09:17.414 --> 09:19.084
Are we going to get
a lot of money?

09:19.084 --> 09:20.320
Um, I don't know.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.123
Are you going to get
a bigger office?

09:22.123 --> 09:24.996
Hey, come on.
What's wrong with my office?

09:24.996 --> 09:26.332
Okay.

09:26.332 --> 09:27.668
Ah.
You know what?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.471
What?

09:29.471 --> 09:31.041
I'm-- I'm proud of you.

09:31.041 --> 09:32.979
You are?

09:32.979 --> 09:34.014
Yeah.

09:34.014 --> 09:35.885
Thank you so much. Okay.

09:35.885 --> 09:37.153
Okay.
All right.

09:37.153 --> 09:39.024
Go get the promotion.
Let's go. Come on.

09:39.024 --> 09:41.529
<i>Yes.
It was all okay.</i>

09:41.529 --> 09:42.865
<i>The body heals.</i>

09:42.865 --> 09:44.802
<i>The liver regenerates.</i>

09:44.802 --> 09:46.472
<i>The spirit heals.</i>

09:46.472 --> 09:49.444
<i>It heals and heals and heals
until you're dead.</i>

09:49.444 --> 09:50.748
Hello.

09:50.748 --> 09:53.754
Oh, come in, come in.

09:53.754 --> 09:56.225
Thank you for
coming to see me.

09:56.225 --> 09:57.294
Oh, of course.

09:57.294 --> 09:59.365
I'm-- I'm very happy
to be here.

09:59.365 --> 10:02.471
Oh, well.
It's hot enough for you?

10:02.471 --> 10:04.075
Where?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

10:04.075 --> 10:05.077
Yeah, yeah.

10:05.077 --> 10:06.714
Uh, I'm just going to say
it 'cause

10:06.714 --> 10:08.249
there's no easy
way to do it.

10:08.249 --> 10:10.822
It's about your position.

10:10.822 --> 10:13.727
Someone job for hired
else we the.

10:13.727 --> 10:16.032
I'm sorry, what?

10:16.032 --> 10:19.137
Someone job for hired
else we the.

10:19.137 --> 10:21.510
You it to go wanted
differently know I.

10:21.510 --> 10:23.514
So did I.

10:23.514 --> 10:25.851
Wait, what?
Who?

10:25.851 --> 10:28.256
Outside hired
someone from here

10:28.256 --> 10:32.430
they-- they wanted
we new blood some in.

10:32.430 --> 10:36.072
Wait, you're hiring someone
from outside to be my boss?

10:36.072 --> 10:39.077
Be the to yes,
the subdivision head.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.850
Look.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.286
Nobody doubts your skill,

10:43.286 --> 10:46.559
but they felt like you were
unwilling to give the time.

10:46.559 --> 10:49.933
You've taken how many personal
days in the last three weeks?

10:49.933 --> 10:51.202
I've worked here
for 15 years.

10:51.202 --> 10:53.607
I had a--
I had a bad couple of weeks.

10:53.607 --> 10:55.711
Well, you're
an excellent doctor.

10:55.711 --> 10:58.617
Everyone agrees.

10:58.617 --> 11:01.957
<i>The rest didn't really matter.</i>

11:01.957 --> 11:04.061
<i>Janice had some
serious objections</i>

11:04.061 --> 11:05.864
<i>to Toby's appointment.</i>

11:05.864 --> 11:08.670
But, look, I--
I didn't say never.

11:08.670 --> 11:10.741
If you start putting
in the face time,

11:10.741 --> 11:12.645
you never know
what could happen.

11:16.886 --> 11:18.990
Um, who-- who got it?

11:18.990 --> 11:20.794
If you don't
mind me asking.

11:20.794 --> 11:23.667
Oh, sure.
H-His name is Aaron Schwartz.

11:23.667 --> 11:25.303
He was up for
a subdivision head at Sinai.

11:25.303 --> 11:26.973
We got him here.
He's a bright guy.

11:26.973 --> 11:28.811
Very dedicated.
You'll get along.

11:28.811 --> 11:30.647
No, I know him.
I went to, uh--

11:30.647 --> 11:32.483
I went to medical school
with him.

11:42.738 --> 11:47.114
<i>Toby tried to pull it together,
but this time it was hard.</i>

11:57.802 --> 12:00.406
<i>Aaron Schwartz?</i>

12:04.849 --> 12:06.352
<i>Karen Cooper 911.</i>

12:06.352 --> 12:09.458
<i>Subarachnoid hemorrhage,
evidence of herniation.</i>

12:13.233 --> 12:15.069
<i>Karen Cooper
had suffered a rare</i>

12:15.069 --> 12:17.206
<i>but not-unheard-of
result of surgery</i>

12:17.206 --> 12:19.077
<i>that left her
with the kind of injury</i>

12:19.077 --> 12:21.348
<i>that destroys a person's
ability to think</i>

12:21.348 --> 12:24.054
<i>and breathe
and function in a body.</i>

12:24.054 --> 12:27.126
<i>In other words,
Karen Cooper was brain dead.</i>

12:27.126 --> 12:28.997
I thought the liver
made her better?

12:28.997 --> 12:30.266
You said that she was
getting better.

12:30.266 --> 12:33.540
Yeah, I'm--
I'm so sorry, David.

12:33.540 --> 12:35.377
So, uh, what do we do now?

12:35.377 --> 12:36.947
What's-- What's--
What's the next steps?

12:36.947 --> 12:38.449
Well, it's--
it's a massive bleed.

12:38.449 --> 12:40.286
There's evidence
of herniation.

12:40.286 --> 12:42.926
It's, uh, it's an injury that's
very hard to recover from.

12:42.926 --> 12:44.261
What's that mean?

12:44.261 --> 12:46.498
It's hard
to recover from this.

12:46.498 --> 12:47.568
I'm sorry.

12:47.568 --> 12:50.006
People just don't recover
from this.

12:52.344 --> 12:54.949
This isn't supposed
to happen to her.

12:54.949 --> 12:57.120
To us.
This-- This is not fair.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.355
I know.
I know.

12:58.355 --> 12:59.893
It shouldn't happen to--
to anyone.

12:59.893 --> 13:01.128
I know.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.132
This is just unacceptable.

13:03.132 --> 13:05.203
Well, yeah, it's a tough blow.
I'm really sorry.

13:05.203 --> 13:07.073
Who else can I talk
to about this?

13:07.073 --> 13:08.375
Well, you've spoken
to Dr. Lintz.

13:08.375 --> 13:10.379
No, I mean who is
the person in charge?

13:10.379 --> 13:12.483
Who's your boss?

13:12.483 --> 13:14.421
Sorry, it's just a very
unfortunate situation.

13:14.421 --> 13:16.291
It's not like--
I need to speak
to someone about this.

13:16.291 --> 13:18.763
Someone who is actually
in charge.

13:18.763 --> 13:20.266
It's just, it's not fair.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.670
Fair?
Yeah, that's right.

13:21.670 --> 13:24.041
This is not what I was promised.
It is not fair.

13:24.041 --> 13:26.679
<i>But Toby knew the truth.</i>
Okay, there's a social worker
that maybe you could speak to.

13:26.679 --> 13:29.251
You haven't answered
my questions.
<i>Death is not unfair.</i>

13:29.251 --> 13:31.021
There is a social worker
on duty.

13:31.021 --> 13:32.925
I will send the social worker
up for you.

13:32.925 --> 13:35.396
<i>It's life that's unfair.</i>

13:35.396 --> 13:37.668
Sorry,
I have other patients.

13:37.668 --> 13:39.606
<i>As if the David Coopers
of the world</i>

13:39.606 --> 13:42.845
<i>really wanted to be part
of a system that's fair.</i>

13:42.845 --> 13:45.316
<i>It didn't matter.
Because none of this was fair.</i>

13:45.316 --> 13:47.053
<i>Toby was denied advancement</i>

13:47.053 --> 13:49.258
<i>because he took care
of his children.</i>

13:49.258 --> 13:51.328
<i>Toby's own son had
discovered porn</i>

13:51.328 --> 13:53.967
<i>and his daughter was absent
a maternal figure</i>

13:53.967 --> 13:55.436
<i>who could have
maybe prevented her</i>

13:55.436 --> 13:57.174
<i>from getting
publicly humiliated</i>

13:57.174 --> 13:58.611
<i>all because she was out</i>

13:58.611 --> 14:01.583
<i>on some wonderfuckfest
with Sam Rothberg.</i>

14:01.583 --> 14:04.589
<i>Piece of shit Sam Rothberg,
who wore nylon</i>

14:04.589 --> 14:07.427
<i>Adidas pants with stripes
on the side on Sundays,</i>

14:07.427 --> 14:11.402
<i>who had endless bets on endless
brackets for March Madness.</i>

14:11.402 --> 14:13.105
<i>This was fair?</i>
Dr. Fleishman?

14:13.105 --> 14:15.142
Yeah, sorry. Just fine.
Is everything okay?

14:15.142 --> 14:18.315
Yeah, I was just--
Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

14:20.253 --> 14:22.056
<i>But once David Cooper
put the notion</i>

14:22.056 --> 14:26.599
<i>of fairness into Toby's brain,
Toby found it would not leave.</i>

14:29.338 --> 14:32.144
<i>There are questions a person
shouldn't ask</i>

14:32.144 --> 14:34.147
<i>because they're unanswerable.</i>

14:43.499 --> 14:44.969
Oh. Hello, Phillip.

14:44.969 --> 14:47.675
Hey. Toby.
I'm glad I caught you.

14:47.675 --> 14:49.645
Uh, I-I was wondering... Yeah.

14:49.645 --> 14:52.050
I'm applying for
the Plotkin fellowship.

14:52.050 --> 14:53.486
Oh, in nephrology?

14:53.486 --> 14:55.490
Yeah, and I wanted
to see if you

14:55.490 --> 14:57.962
would write me
a recommendation?

14:57.962 --> 14:59.632
But you're--
you're in hepatology.

14:59.632 --> 15:03.105
Yeah, I want to be able
to run a gastro unit

15:03.105 --> 15:04.743
and then a post in admin.

15:04.743 --> 15:07.313
Dr. Bartuck says that's
the fastest path to the top.

15:07.313 --> 15:09.018
Yeah, is that--
is that why you do this?

15:09.018 --> 15:10.420
To get to the top?

15:10.420 --> 15:13.091
I do this because I'm a healer.
I hold life in my--

15:13.091 --> 15:15.697
Hey, hey.
No, come on. I'm curious.

15:17.467 --> 15:20.808
A man's worth is no greater
than his ambitions.

15:20.808 --> 15:24.047
That's beautiful.
Is that a-- Is that Whitman?

15:24.047 --> 15:26.218
You know what?
Whatever.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.288
Sure. Why don't you write it
yourself, and I'll sign it?

15:28.288 --> 15:30.828
I wouldn't really know
what to say.

15:30.828 --> 15:32.063
Thanks, Toby.

15:32.063 --> 15:33.834
It's Dr. Fleishman,
okay, Phillip?

15:33.834 --> 15:35.504
You call me
Dr. Fleishman.

15:48.462 --> 15:50.801
Hi, Toby.

15:50.801 --> 15:52.672
Hi.
Yeah, sorry.

15:52.672 --> 15:54.174
I was just, um...

15:54.174 --> 15:57.180
Hey. I heard about
the new subdivision head.

15:57.180 --> 15:58.816
Yeah?
You were a candidate, right?

15:58.816 --> 16:01.122
Uh, yeah.
I'm so sorry.

16:01.122 --> 16:03.159
Just--
It doesn't make sense.

16:03.159 --> 16:04.629
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, no, no, it's fine.

16:04.629 --> 16:06.365
We talked about it,
but ultimately, I think

16:06.365 --> 16:08.169
the thing I care most about is
patient interface, so...

16:08.169 --> 16:10.339
Right.
Yeah. You know, you always
have to be on guard

16:10.339 --> 16:12.010
for the ways that,
you know, people want

16:12.010 --> 16:14.347
to advance you out of the thing
you got into medicine for, so...

16:14.347 --> 16:17.486
O-Of course, but, God,
losing sucks.

16:19.525 --> 16:21.461
Yeah, it sucks.

16:21.461 --> 16:24.401
Toby, I've learned more from you
than any other teacher

16:24.401 --> 16:26.171
that they have
in this place.

16:26.171 --> 16:28.041
Really?

16:28.041 --> 16:30.680
Hmm. Sorry, that is such
a nice thing to say.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.718
Oh, well, it's true, so...

16:32.718 --> 16:34.120
That is so nice.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.791
And I'm sorry.
You know, you were right.

16:35.791 --> 16:38.229
You know, losing sucks.
Actually--
I know.

16:38.229 --> 16:40.466
I'm actually
so upset about it.

16:40.466 --> 16:43.239
Yeah.
It's funny 'cause you, you know,

16:43.239 --> 16:45.376
all these years,
um, you know,

16:45.376 --> 16:47.749
Rachel, my-- my ex-wife,
uh, she was always telling me

16:47.749 --> 16:49.585
I wasn't ambitious enough.
And I would just say,

16:49.585 --> 16:51.354
"I'm not an ambition monster,"
you know?

16:51.354 --> 16:52.925
Right.
It's different.

16:52.925 --> 16:55.296
And also, like, there's this
concept of enough, you know?

16:55.296 --> 16:56.666
And it's weird.
I always thought it was crazy,

16:56.666 --> 17:01.610
but, honestly,
this feels pretty bad.

17:01.610 --> 17:05.517
Yeah, this has me asking a lot
of hard questions of myself.

17:05.517 --> 17:07.655
Of course, but you know
that none of that

17:07.655 --> 17:09.024
is your fault, right?

17:09.024 --> 17:10.493
Hmm.
No.

17:10.493 --> 17:12.497
Oh, my God, it's--
it's the fact that,

17:12.497 --> 17:14.200
you know,
this world is stupid.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.537
I-It values the wrong things,

17:15.537 --> 17:18.577
but I have watched you
keep all your values

17:18.577 --> 17:20.647
the same despite all these,
you know,

17:20.647 --> 17:23.185
all these chaotic pressures
that are put on you.

17:23.185 --> 17:26.258
And I really admire that.

17:26.258 --> 17:28.329
I really want
to be like that.

17:28.329 --> 17:29.965
No, when I--
See, when I first--

17:29.965 --> 17:32.003
<i>This was what he wanted.</i>

17:32.003 --> 17:33.540
<i>Someone who cared.</i>

17:33.540 --> 17:35.409
<i>Someone who could listen.</i>

17:35.409 --> 17:37.314
<i>Someone who would root for him.</i>

17:37.314 --> 17:40.253
<i>You can understand how,
given his recent months,</i>

17:40.253 --> 17:42.490
<i>his recent years,
his recent hour,</i>

17:42.490 --> 17:44.695
<i>just how much this kindness
meant to him.</i>

17:44.695 --> 17:47.668
Uh, would you maybe want to talk
about this more after work?

17:47.668 --> 17:49.605
You know, maybe--
I don't know,

17:49.605 --> 17:52.845
maybe I could take
you out to dinner or something.

17:52.845 --> 17:55.216
Oh.
Um...

17:55.216 --> 17:58.656
You know, I--
We have that--

17:58.656 --> 18:01.328
I have that Hoffman sonogram
that you told me to check up on,

18:01.328 --> 18:03.132
so I'm gonna go
do that right now.

18:03.132 --> 18:04.334
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

18:04.334 --> 18:05.904
Thank you,
Dr. Fleishman.

18:05.904 --> 18:07.173
Yeah.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.877
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

18:08.877 --> 18:11.649
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

18:11.649 --> 18:14.120
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

18:14.120 --> 18:16.124
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

18:17.895 --> 18:19.097
How was it?

18:19.097 --> 18:20.800
Dad, why are you
walking so fast?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.938
We're going out to dinner.
You got your promotion?

18:22.938 --> 18:25.176
Is your office bigger?
Actually, you know what?
I told them I didn't want it.

18:25.176 --> 18:26.813
Yeah, I didn't want to deal
with office stuff all the time,

18:26.813 --> 18:28.516
and I don't want to be
anybody's boss.

18:28.516 --> 18:30.954
Being a boss is terrible
and then everybody hates you.

18:30.954 --> 18:32.423
Come on.

18:32.423 --> 18:34.394
Where are we eating?

18:37.334 --> 18:38.503
Dad?
Yeah?

18:38.503 --> 18:40.172
Dad, are you okay?

18:40.172 --> 18:42.110
I'm fine.
Just eat.

18:51.629 --> 18:54.602
<i>And then, his entire body
paralyzed by his first carb</i>

18:54.602 --> 18:59.010
<i>intake in nearly 30 years,
it became very quiet again.</i>

19:01.181 --> 19:04.856
<i>The thing is, he hadn't
even asked for a promotion.</i>

19:04.856 --> 19:07.060
<i>He hadn't asked for this
particular rejection</i>

19:07.060 --> 19:11.268
<i>in what was fast becoming
the worst summer of his life.</i>

19:11.268 --> 19:13.439
<i>His rejection wouldn't matter
when he was fired</i>

19:13.439 --> 19:15.844
<i>for being
a sexual harasser, anyway.</i>

19:15.844 --> 19:17.615
Jessica!
Dad!

19:17.615 --> 19:19.752
Dad, Aunt Cherry's here.

19:23.359 --> 19:24.562
Cherry.

19:24.562 --> 19:26.231
What are you doing here?
Hi, Jessica.

19:26.231 --> 19:29.304
Hi. It's Saturday.
You asked me to come.

19:29.304 --> 19:31.374
What's wrong with you?
Saturday.

19:31.374 --> 19:33.546
You said you had a party
to go to.

19:33.546 --> 19:35.349
We talked about how nice
it would be,

19:35.349 --> 19:36.753
just me and Jessica
and the kids?

19:36.753 --> 19:38.623
Oh, God. Sorry.
No, there's no party.

19:38.623 --> 19:40.459
I'm sorry,
I totally spaced.

19:40.459 --> 19:43.432
It's been a-- It's kind of been
like a bad week.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.836
He didn't get
his promotion.

19:44.836 --> 19:47.206
He didn't <i>want</i>
his promotion.

19:47.206 --> 19:48.776
Sure, doofus.
Hey, show me your room.

19:48.776 --> 19:50.547
Okay.
It's my room, too.

19:50.547 --> 19:52.016
We got a dog.
Really?

19:52.016 --> 19:54.354
Yeah.
Hi. I'm sorry
it's such a mess.

19:54.354 --> 19:56.759
It all just kind of, like, accumulated.

19:56.759 --> 19:58.462
You know, I dealt
with Rachel being gone.

19:58.462 --> 20:01.669
I did-- I handled that.
But then, I don't know.

20:01.669 --> 20:03.038
I took my eye off the ball,

20:03.038 --> 20:05.175
and suddenly,
everything else fell apart.

20:05.175 --> 20:07.881
Ugh, please don't listen to me.
This is how I sound now.

20:07.881 --> 20:10.052
Sorry, every time I'm, like,
almost back to normal,

20:10.052 --> 20:13.325
something happens
and I just, like, I don't know.

20:13.325 --> 20:15.831
I'm really sorry
you took the trip in.

20:15.831 --> 20:18.035
You lost a promotion.
You're divorced.

20:18.035 --> 20:21.007
Welcome to middle age.
The alternative was dying young.

20:21.007 --> 20:24.080
Now tell me about this party
you're definitely going to.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.586
Uh, it's a friend from my year
in Israel, Shana.

20:26.586 --> 20:28.957
She and her husband, Mord,
have this, like, annual reunion.

20:28.957 --> 20:32.197
I-- I stopped going after
Rachel and I got married.

20:32.197 --> 20:34.100
Then go.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.402
I can't.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.639
Sorry, I'm--
I'm so embarrassed.

20:36.639 --> 20:38.141
I don't know how to, like,
present myself

20:38.141 --> 20:40.312
to the world anymore.
You're divorced.

20:40.312 --> 20:42.918
Most people are divorced.

20:42.918 --> 20:44.822
Go take a shower.

20:44.822 --> 20:46.125
Really?
Go.

20:46.125 --> 20:48.629
- Okay, okay. I'm going.
- Go.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.370
<i>So Toby headed to the annual
get-together</i>

20:52.370 --> 20:54.776
<i>from our year abroad,</i>

20:54.776 --> 20:56.713
<i>the one I went to every year
and the one</i>

20:56.713 --> 20:59.785
<i>Toby hadn't been
to in 15 years.</i>

21:02.624 --> 21:04.561
There you go. Thanks.

21:07.935 --> 21:10.006
<i>In the intervening years,
the only get-togethers</i>

21:10.006 --> 21:13.012
<i>he had been to were terrible
one's with Rachel's friends.</i>

21:13.012 --> 21:14.849
<i>When he walked into
the Israel reunion,</i>

21:14.849 --> 21:17.487
<i>he hadn't remembered that
the purpose of people</i>

21:17.487 --> 21:19.791
<i>gathering was to be fun.</i>

21:21.361 --> 21:25.704
- We're here!
- Toby Fleishman!

21:25.704 --> 21:28.241
- Toby Fleishman?
- Oh, my God.

21:28.241 --> 21:30.814
- My God!
- Toby!

21:30.814 --> 21:33.920
- Hi!
- Oh, look at this.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.222
Can you even?

21:35.222 --> 21:36.425
Oh, yes. Oh.

21:36.425 --> 21:37.761
Yes, the table works.

21:37.761 --> 21:39.798
Ms. Rachel, this is amazing.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.836
- Oh, thank you.
- Who did you use?

21:41.836 --> 21:43.171
Yeah, actually,
we got the guys

21:43.171 --> 21:45.644
who created Levittown
to consult, so...

21:45.644 --> 21:47.714
I don't know them.
Okay, well, no, it's a joke.

21:47.714 --> 21:49.719
I'm just, you know, kidding.
Uh, Marisa McMazz.

21:49.719 --> 21:51.354
Oh.
She's Miriam's person.

21:51.354 --> 21:53.225
Yes, yes, yes.
I love her. Yeah.

21:53.225 --> 21:54.762
Did she make you
do the quiz?

21:54.762 --> 21:55.763
She did.

21:55.763 --> 21:57.199
Oh, wait.
Don't tell me.

21:57.199 --> 21:58.469
Was it-- Was it mid-cench?

21:58.469 --> 22:00.038
It's mid-century.

22:00.038 --> 22:01.341
Aah! I knew it!

22:01.341 --> 22:04.080
Rachel Fleishman!
Mid-century!

22:04.080 --> 22:05.550
I knew it.

22:05.550 --> 22:08.623
So, Fleish, how are things
at the hospital?

22:08.623 --> 22:09.926
Well, it's good, actually.

22:09.926 --> 22:12.764
Yeah, we're getting
into crypto, so...

22:12.764 --> 22:14.602
Wait, what is that?
Is that another joke?

22:14.602 --> 22:15.937
That was a joke, yeah.

22:15.937 --> 22:18.375
- Fleishman!
- I can't believe!

22:18.375 --> 22:21.582
- Toby!
- Oh, Toby!

22:21.582 --> 22:23.118
You look great.

22:23.118 --> 22:24.487
It's so good to see you.

22:24.487 --> 22:27.494
Oh! It's Toby Fleishman!

22:27.494 --> 22:28.696
Toby, my man.

22:28.696 --> 22:30.332
I'm glad you're here.

22:30.332 --> 22:31.669
Toby, this is
a huge upgrade.

22:31.669 --> 22:33.372
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

22:33.372 --> 22:35.243
I wish I could go back there
with you.

22:35.243 --> 22:36.478
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.

22:36.478 --> 22:37.914
Yeah, no, actually,
you know what?

22:37.914 --> 22:39.417
I liked our old place.
It was sweet, you know.

22:39.417 --> 22:40.654
We had mismatched furniture.

22:40.654 --> 22:42.189
It was like, you know,
paradise for me.

22:42.189 --> 22:43.425
Toby, this place, though.

22:43.425 --> 22:44.728
You could--
You could get lost in here.

22:44.728 --> 22:46.565
Like, the ceilings alone,
it's--

22:46.565 --> 22:48.335
They make you look shorter. Rich.

22:48.335 --> 22:51.241
I mean, they make all of us--
I meant all of us look shorter.

22:51.241 --> 22:53.478
Uh, the royal you.

22:53.478 --> 22:55.349
The old place didn't have
air-conditioning.

22:55.349 --> 22:57.220
It did.
We had-- We had units.

22:57.220 --> 22:58.623
Eww.
That's what I meant.

22:58.623 --> 23:01.562
Thank you.
Toby hates change.

23:01.562 --> 23:02.998
Actually,
I'm fine with change.

23:02.998 --> 23:05.469
Well, these chairs
are lovely.

23:05.469 --> 23:06.772
How are you, Toby?

23:06.772 --> 23:08.677
Libby said you've been having
a tough time.

23:08.677 --> 23:10.245
I'm okay.
I got divorced.

23:10.245 --> 23:13.352
I got married and then divorced.
I hear this happens, though.

23:13.352 --> 23:14.588
Are you doing okay?
Yeah.

23:14.588 --> 23:16.491
So, you're on the apps?

23:16.491 --> 23:19.565
Um, yes.
Uh, you know, sometimes.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.635
What's it like?
It's crazy, right?

23:21.635 --> 23:23.038
Yeah.
Honestly, it is insane.

23:23.038 --> 23:25.075
Like, it's-- it's gross.
I mean, you feel dirty.

23:25.075 --> 23:26.311
Oh, my God, it's Seth!

23:26.311 --> 23:27.514
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:27.514 --> 23:29.084
Hey.
You showed.

23:29.084 --> 23:31.288
I did.
I might-- I might never leave.

23:31.288 --> 23:32.490
Oh, hello.
Good to see you.

23:32.490 --> 23:33.893
You, too.

23:33.893 --> 23:35.295
You brought your appetite.

23:35.295 --> 23:38.570
- You're looking fit.
- Grace looks good.

23:38.570 --> 23:42.143
- Oh!
- Yay.

23:42.143 --> 23:43.813
This is fantastic.

23:43.813 --> 23:47.119
Hey. You guys ever go
skiing in Gstaad?

23:47.119 --> 23:49.057
'Cause I just heard it's great.
We should all go.

23:49.057 --> 23:50.627
I'm-- I'm getting sick
of Vail, right?

23:50.627 --> 23:51.929
Oh, he says this
every time.

23:51.929 --> 23:53.332
Gotta check
with the boss here.

23:53.332 --> 23:54.635
- Ooh, wild.
- Boss, please.

23:54.635 --> 23:55.904
Boss check.

23:55.904 --> 23:57.574
I likey.
Let's do it.

23:57.574 --> 23:59.277
- Yes.
- All in favor of Gstaad?

23:59.277 --> 24:00.547
- Okay.
- Sure.

24:00.547 --> 24:02.216
In. Why not?

24:02.216 --> 24:03.786
Uh, Toby, you know,
I've been meaning to ask,

24:03.786 --> 24:05.823
do you have
a good concierge guy?

24:05.823 --> 24:08.696
Working in pharma, you'd think
I'd know all the good people.

24:08.696 --> 24:10.533
And yet, you only seem to know
the bad ones.

24:10.533 --> 24:12.971
Um... that was a joke.

24:12.971 --> 24:15.275
I'm j-- That was a joke.

24:15.275 --> 24:17.080
That was so stupid, Toby.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.916
Um, are you and Roxanne
going to put Max into robotics?

24:18.916 --> 24:20.921
And he looks up at the doctor
and he goes to the doctor,

24:20.921 --> 24:22.423
"Uh, doctor, are you Jewish?"

24:22.423 --> 24:25.062
And the doctor says, "No, no."
And he goes, "Oh, shit."

24:33.680 --> 24:34.849
Was that true?

24:34.849 --> 24:36.618
It's true. It's true.
It's true.

24:36.618 --> 24:38.823
And then he died under--
under anesthesia.

24:38.823 --> 24:39.792
No!

24:39.792 --> 24:43.165
He died. Yeah.
He died, yeah.

24:43.165 --> 24:45.904
Um, are you going
to put Max in robotics?

24:45.904 --> 24:48.208
Yes.
STEM all the way.

24:48.208 --> 24:51.247
He made this little character
out of Legos.

24:51.247 --> 24:52.450
It can walk.
It's amazing.

24:52.450 --> 24:53.820
Oh, Solly did
the same thing.

24:53.820 --> 24:55.523
The little Lego guy can bowl.
It's insane.

24:55.523 --> 24:57.895
Can you imagine if they taught
us this stuff at that age?

24:57.895 --> 25:00.533
Speaking of which,
what would you do differently?

25:00.533 --> 25:02.136
- Oh.
- Hmm.

25:02.136 --> 25:04.107
No, I'm not saying I would
do anything different,

25:04.107 --> 25:06.845
it's just, you know, just, like,
what a world kind of thing.

25:06.845 --> 25:09.952
Yeah, I can totally see you
as a tech guy.

25:09.952 --> 25:12.190
Uh, sorry, I don't know
if I have enough, uh,

25:12.190 --> 25:13.627
hoodies for that.

25:15.730 --> 25:17.800
It was a joke, Toby.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.540
You're exactly who you
were always going to be.

25:22.844 --> 25:25.617
So how's the liver business,
my man?

25:25.617 --> 25:27.153
You asked me that.

25:27.153 --> 25:29.591
I mean, you always
fucking ask me that, so...

25:29.591 --> 25:31.862
I...

25:31.862 --> 25:35.235
Excuse me, I got to go.

25:35.235 --> 25:40.279
Sorry. Excuse me.

25:40.279 --> 25:42.116
Mm-hmm.

25:53.004 --> 25:55.944
Uh, so she is
an anthropologist...

25:55.944 --> 25:57.681
Okay.
...and a veterinarian.

25:57.681 --> 26:02.189
She is trying to, uh,
save some species of bird.

26:02.189 --> 26:04.427
Really? That's-- Okay.
That's admirable.

26:04.427 --> 26:06.732
I don't know if I'm, like,
ready to be set up.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.470
I had this weird, like,
quasi-relationship

26:09.470 --> 26:12.042
with this woman who literally
did not leave her house.

26:12.042 --> 26:13.946
It is weird out th--
Yes, I'm serious.

26:13.946 --> 26:16.919
It is weird out there.
It filled me with trepidation.

26:16.919 --> 26:18.656
It's just a divorce, man.

26:18.656 --> 26:20.092
No, I know.
I know. But it--

26:20.092 --> 26:21.796
I don't know,
it felt like more than that.

26:21.796 --> 26:23.331
It felt like a referendum
on my--

26:23.331 --> 26:25.603
my life and my choices,
you know?

26:25.603 --> 26:27.373
What if it's just bad luck?
Hmm.

26:27.373 --> 26:30.980
What if it's just sometimes
life isn't fair?

26:30.980 --> 26:33.519
Hmm.
Yeah, fair.

26:33.519 --> 26:35.790
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know.

26:35.790 --> 26:37.126
Maybe you're right.

26:37.126 --> 26:39.532
Yeah, sometimes things
just aren't fair.

26:39.532 --> 26:42.938
I-I think I don't like to think
in those terms.

26:42.938 --> 26:45.409
That's what those terms
are there for.

26:45.409 --> 26:47.547
Do you know what I think
about all the time?

26:47.547 --> 26:51.856
When we took that hike
and got lost and it got dark...

26:51.856 --> 26:55.062
<i>It had been so long
since he felt accepted,</i>

26:55.062 --> 26:57.567
<i>like he didn't have
to justify his existence,</i>

26:57.567 --> 27:02.009
<i>that people just took him
on his own terms.</i>

27:02.009 --> 27:04.113
<i>Maybe this was the key.</i>

27:04.113 --> 27:06.552
<i>To spend time with people
who knew you</i>

27:06.552 --> 27:09.825
<i>when you were all potential.</i>

27:09.825 --> 27:11.327
<i>Maybe, in some way...</i>

27:11.327 --> 27:13.866
<i>...you remained
all potential to them.</i>

27:13.866 --> 27:16.471
<i>Your mistakes were anomalies
to them.</i>

27:16.471 --> 27:18.007
[ clapping ] Yeah!

27:18.007 --> 27:22.684
They lost our luggage,
the traffic was crazy.

27:22.684 --> 27:25.356
Hey. I remember you
from a college.

27:25.356 --> 27:27.326
Good. Yeah.

27:27.326 --> 27:29.196
Did I miss everything?

27:31.434 --> 27:32.738
You know why I eat these?

27:32.738 --> 27:34.741
Because they're awful?
That's right.

27:34.741 --> 27:37.680
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Thank you.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.483
I'm gonna get some
diet ice for you.

27:39.483 --> 27:42.022
Diet ice, never not funny.

27:42.022 --> 27:44.360
So, uh, who are you writing
about these days?

27:44.360 --> 27:46.164
She's not at the magazine anymore.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.168
Yeah, I'm not anywhere
anymore, Mord.

27:48.168 --> 27:49.571
Mmh-mnh.
No, I don't want it.

27:49.571 --> 27:51.141
It's too sweet.
I'll take that.

27:51.141 --> 27:53.546
No, it smells like something
a teenage girl would make.

27:53.546 --> 27:56.786
This is really fun.
We never go to parties, ever.

27:56.786 --> 27:58.255
We go to parties
all the time.

27:58.255 --> 27:59.992
But we don't go
to fun parties.

27:59.992 --> 28:02.664
This is my very favorite night
of the whole year.

28:02.664 --> 28:04.233
Wow.

28:04.233 --> 28:06.337
Wow? I mean, what?
Is that-- Is that bad?

28:06.337 --> 28:08.642
- Nope. No problem.
- Your booze.

28:08.642 --> 28:11.348
Thank you very much.
Mm-hmm.

28:11.348 --> 28:13.553
Hey, hey, hey.
How was [ bleep ]?

28:13.553 --> 28:15.488
I loved it.
Mm-hmm.

28:15.488 --> 28:17.794
People greet you,
they call your kids by name.

28:17.794 --> 28:19.898
Honestly, I say this
with no irony.

28:19.898 --> 28:21.702
It's clean.
It's safe.

28:21.702 --> 28:23.072
Uh, Libby found it
soul-crushing.

28:23.072 --> 28:24.741
Why?
Because she hates joy.

28:24.741 --> 28:26.444
Wow, he really gets you.
It's beautiful.

28:26.444 --> 28:29.918
Yeah. No, it's hotter than
the surface of the sun,

28:29.918 --> 28:33.191
number one.
Also, all the characters,

28:33.191 --> 28:36.665
all the rides, like,
the canned happiness.

28:36.665 --> 28:38.068
Like, for what?

28:38.068 --> 28:39.938
I would love a can
of happiness. No.

28:39.938 --> 28:42.042
So, we had these passes
for the rides, right?

28:42.042 --> 28:44.179
They came with the club
level thing or whatever.

28:44.179 --> 28:47.654
And, so, you got on every ride
in, like, six minutes.

28:47.654 --> 28:48.956
Yeah!

28:48.956 --> 28:51.227
But you have to go on this
empty line,

28:51.227 --> 28:53.966
past this other line where all
these people have been waiting,

28:53.966 --> 28:55.737
and you realize,
oh, I'm not--

28:55.737 --> 28:57.473
I'm not subverting
any line here.

28:57.473 --> 28:58.809
I'm cutting a line.

28:58.809 --> 29:00.211
I'm subverting the system
for the people

29:00.211 --> 29:02.483
who just don't happen
to be on the club level.

29:02.483 --> 29:04.722
That's how it works.
Yeah, but that's not fair.

29:04.722 --> 29:06.391
But it's not fair
in your direction.

29:06.391 --> 29:07.594
Exactly.

29:07.594 --> 29:09.264
A thing about my wife is she can
be unhappy both

29:09.264 --> 29:10.866
on a line
and cutting a line.

29:10.866 --> 29:12.370
She's pretty amazing, isn't she?

29:12.370 --> 29:14.541
It is. Yeah.
I can't wait to take my kids.

29:14.541 --> 29:15.777
Can't wait.
Really?

29:15.777 --> 29:16.979
You can probably get
a senior discount

29:16.979 --> 29:18.181
by the time you have kids.

29:18.181 --> 29:19.484
- Oh!
- It's terrible.

29:19.484 --> 29:20.920
You would go and you
would think about how,

29:20.920 --> 29:22.390
like, how same-shaped

29:22.390 --> 29:25.128
all the women are,
how stupid all the people are.

29:25.128 --> 29:26.464
All the women there,
they wear--

29:26.464 --> 29:28.401
they wear yoga pants
instead of regular pants.

29:28.401 --> 29:30.272
They're just, like,
yelling at their children,

29:30.272 --> 29:32.978
and then you look down
and you're like, "Oh, God.

29:32.978 --> 29:34.848
I'm wearing yoga pants.

29:34.848 --> 29:36.384
I'm yelling at my children."

29:36.384 --> 29:38.722
The common denominator
is you.

29:38.722 --> 29:40.560
I don't get it. Why can't you
just wear regular pants?

29:40.560 --> 29:42.230
Yeah, I don't understand
why you're so upset.

29:42.230 --> 29:45.001
My man, asking that will not
yield a satisfactory answer.

29:45.001 --> 29:46.303
Just please
trust me on this.

29:46.303 --> 29:48.408
Okay.
Just, you know, save yourself.

29:48.408 --> 29:50.412
Uh, we told Yvonne
we'd be back by 1:00.

29:50.412 --> 29:51.815
It's 12:30.
No, no, no, no, no.

29:51.815 --> 29:53.051
It's my favorite night
of the year.

29:53.051 --> 29:54.286
I wish you would stop
saying that.

29:54.286 --> 29:55.890
You're not taking
our Libby away.

29:55.890 --> 29:57.426
Please.
I just-- A little longer.

29:57.426 --> 29:59.831
I never, ever see
these people, ever.

29:59.831 --> 30:01.969
I'm reliving the glory
of my youth.

30:01.969 --> 30:03.606
She had
a glorious youth.

30:03.606 --> 30:05.877
I did. I did.

30:05.877 --> 30:08.214
It is time to go.

30:10.452 --> 30:12.055
I'll take a car.

30:14.795 --> 30:16.632
I'll see you guys.

30:16.632 --> 30:18.067
Oh, see you later.

30:19.838 --> 30:21.174
He's leaving?

30:21.174 --> 30:24.113
No, he doesn't--
He has an early morning.

30:24.113 --> 30:26.283
Oh, hey, awesome.
Vanessa's gonna come.

30:26.283 --> 30:27.987
You guys think we'll be here
in an hour?

30:27.987 --> 30:29.725
H-- Wait, she's coming here?
Yeah.

30:29.725 --> 30:31.360
No.
Yeah.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.799
This night is for people who
are going gently into midlife.

30:33.799 --> 30:35.301
If I can send my husband home,

30:35.301 --> 30:37.372
you can have one night
without your young girlfriend.

30:37.372 --> 30:39.176
Have you considered
maybe I like my girlfriend

30:39.176 --> 30:41.080
more than you appear
to like your husband?

30:41.080 --> 30:43.318
- Oh.
- What's that?

30:43.318 --> 30:44.855
I said, "Maybe"--
No, I heard.

30:44.855 --> 30:46.057
All right.

30:46.057 --> 30:47.426
I don't know.

30:47.426 --> 30:49.798
I feel like I wish I still lived
in the city,

30:49.798 --> 30:51.869
or, like,
even in Israel.

30:51.869 --> 30:53.539
My whole life
was ahead of me.

30:53.539 --> 30:55.710
I was at the beginning
of something.

30:55.710 --> 30:57.112
Mm-hmm.

30:57.112 --> 30:58.950
We all were at the beginning
of something.

30:58.950 --> 31:00.285
And now?

31:00.285 --> 31:01.989
Now we're at the end
of something.

31:01.989 --> 31:04.360
No, we're not.
We're just ongoing.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.464
We so are.
And you want to know how I know?

31:06.464 --> 31:07.634
Hmm?

31:07.634 --> 31:09.236
Because we keep revisiting
the beginning.

31:09.236 --> 31:10.973
Yeah, you have a nice life,
okay? I was there.

31:10.973 --> 31:13.411
You have, like,
a very nice life there.

31:13.411 --> 31:15.448
Yeah, that's not really
my point.

31:15.448 --> 31:17.486
Really? So what is--
What's your point?

31:17.486 --> 31:20.359
My point is
I have cigarettes.

31:20.359 --> 31:23.231
I just remembered
I have cigarettes.

31:23.231 --> 31:27.439
Who wants to smoke cigarettes
with me?

31:27.439 --> 31:29.177
I'll go.

31:29.177 --> 31:30.646
I'll stand there.

31:30.646 --> 31:33.585
"I'll stand there."
You're such a cool person.

31:33.585 --> 31:34.955
Wow.
What a dweeb.

31:34.955 --> 31:36.490
"I'll stand there."

31:41.066 --> 31:43.071
What were those cigarettes called

31:43.071 --> 31:45.008
that we used
to smoke in Israel?

31:46.812 --> 31:50.185
TIME. Right.

31:50.185 --> 31:53.625
Stands for
This Is My Enjoyment.

31:53.625 --> 31:55.328
Yeah, Israelis.

31:57.232 --> 31:59.838
You shouldn't ash on the ground
of somebody else's house.

31:59.838 --> 32:01.206
Toby.
Mm-hmm?

32:01.206 --> 32:03.211
This is my enjoyment.
This is your emphysema.

32:03.211 --> 32:05.249
I'm gonna go back
inside, okay?

32:05.249 --> 32:07.787
What is with you?
Nothing's with me.

32:07.787 --> 32:10.325
Really? 'Cause you seem
extra annoyed tonight, so...

32:10.325 --> 32:11.862
I'm not.
I'm great.

32:11.862 --> 32:13.733
I'm gonna go back inside.
I'm having a great night.

32:13.733 --> 32:14.934
Oh, good.
Me, too.

32:14.934 --> 32:16.705
You should have been
nicer to Adam.

32:19.009 --> 32:20.913
Adam's fine.
You were kind of a bitch.

32:20.913 --> 32:22.617
What?
Yeah.

32:22.617 --> 32:24.386
You can't treat a person
that way, okay?

32:24.386 --> 32:26.491
You can't-- You can't treat
your husband that way.

32:26.491 --> 32:27.927
Wait, what?
I'm sorry, you're--

32:27.927 --> 32:30.065
you're interested
in me suddenly?

32:30.065 --> 32:31.400
You--
You want to talk about me?

32:31.400 --> 32:32.804
I don't know
what that means.

32:32.804 --> 32:34.273
Oh, it means that usually
you're only interested

32:34.273 --> 32:35.609
in talking about yourself.

32:35.609 --> 32:37.112
No, that's not true.
It's kind of true.

32:37.112 --> 32:38.616
Oh, wow.
You now, too.

32:38.616 --> 32:40.252
Okay, sorry, I didn't realize
I was so negligent.

32:40.252 --> 32:41.956
I didn't say negligent.
I said it was true.

32:41.956 --> 32:43.592
You only talk
about yourself.

32:43.592 --> 32:45.563
I lost my job, you haven't
asked me how I'm doing.

32:45.563 --> 32:47.233
Well, yeah,
you would tell me, man.

32:47.233 --> 32:50.038
Oh, my God. That is really
not a great philosophy

32:50.038 --> 32:51.541
for friendship, pal.

32:51.541 --> 32:53.278
Okay, well, let's just
chill out. Toby...

32:53.278 --> 32:55.081
Yeah.
...you've had
too much to drink.

32:55.081 --> 32:56.785
You're a bitch,
but we love you anyway.

32:56.785 --> 32:59.156
Oh, my God. Do I actually
deserve this right now?

32:59.156 --> 33:01.427
Honestly, like, after listening
to your problems

33:01.427 --> 33:03.231
nonstop for two months?

33:03.231 --> 33:04.568
Nobody asked you
to do that.

33:04.568 --> 33:06.337
You asked me to do that.
No, I didn't.

33:06.337 --> 33:08.207
Sure you did!
And you don't know anything

33:08.207 --> 33:09.711
about my life. Nothing.

33:09.711 --> 33:11.715
And you, like, you don't know
anything about anything.

33:11.715 --> 33:14.353
I know you're married
to a pretty nice guy.

33:14.353 --> 33:16.157
Yeah, but what do you know
about marriage?

33:16.157 --> 33:17.760
Honestly, what do you know
about life?

33:17.760 --> 33:21.300
Like, you have punted every
decision that a person can make.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.637
And why do you get to do that?

33:22.637 --> 33:24.273
'Cause you're handsome?
You're rich?

33:24.273 --> 33:26.143
Going to live forever?
You know what? Fine.

33:26.143 --> 33:27.513
Don't believe him,
but believe me.

33:27.513 --> 33:30.318
If I was Adam, I would be,
like, done with you.

33:30.318 --> 33:33.191
You're going to give me
marriage advice?

33:33.191 --> 33:35.495
You are? Really?
And how about you?

33:35.495 --> 33:37.066
You're going to--
You're going to tell me

33:37.066 --> 33:38.736
how to have
a good relationship?

33:38.736 --> 33:40.840
Even though you haven't even
told your toddler girlfriend

33:40.840 --> 33:42.442
that you lost your job.

33:42.442 --> 33:45.282
You don't know anything, and you
really don't know anything.

33:45.282 --> 33:48.121
Okay, I'm tired of you
treating me like

33:48.121 --> 33:50.693
I'm not a real person
because I'm not married,

33:50.693 --> 33:52.329
I don't have kids.

33:52.329 --> 33:54.568
By the way, Vanessa does know.
I told her.

33:54.568 --> 33:56.136
Congratulations.
That is so big of you.

33:56.136 --> 33:57.540
May you have a long future together.

33:57.540 --> 33:59.310
And may you never get caught
in your lies.

33:59.310 --> 34:01.413
What the fuck
is with you two?

34:01.413 --> 34:03.519
Who said you lived
your lives best?

34:03.519 --> 34:06.056
Who said you're admirable
or I'd want to be like you?

34:06.056 --> 34:07.392
Really?
Jesus Chr--

34:07.392 --> 34:08.662
You know, I just remembered

34:08.662 --> 34:10.165
why I stopped hanging out
with you two.

34:10.165 --> 34:12.069
God, what are you
even talking about?

34:12.069 --> 34:14.107
You're dismissive,
you are needy,

34:14.107 --> 34:16.846
and I was always a joke, honestly.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.716
Seth.
I found you.

34:18.716 --> 34:20.118
Hey. Hi.

34:20.118 --> 34:21.855
Oh, my God.
Yeah, no.

34:21.855 --> 34:23.058
Hey, Toby. Hey.

34:23.058 --> 34:24.326
How are you?

34:24.326 --> 34:26.999
Here, let me go
make you a drink.

34:26.999 --> 34:28.268
I'm gonna go home.

34:28.268 --> 34:30.071
Okay, it's probably
for the best.

34:35.382 --> 34:36.885
What are you doing?

34:36.885 --> 34:39.758
I'm getting a car to the city.
What are you doing?

34:39.758 --> 34:41.127
I'm taking the train.

34:41.127 --> 34:44.099
Just drop me off.

34:44.099 --> 34:45.803
Fine.

34:54.186 --> 34:56.124
All right, yeah, thanks.
This is me.

34:56.124 --> 34:58.629
And she's going
to Penn Station.

34:58.629 --> 35:00.600
Thanks. Okay.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.904
Actually, I-I'm going to
get out here, too.

35:02.904 --> 35:05.342
Thanks.
Libby, what--
what are you doing?

35:05.342 --> 35:08.215
I have to pee.

35:08.215 --> 35:11.120
Can I please pee?

35:11.120 --> 35:12.790
Just be quiet, okay?

35:12.790 --> 35:14.527
The kids are sleeping.

35:22.877 --> 35:24.547
Hi.

35:24.547 --> 35:25.816
Hey.

35:25.816 --> 35:27.554
Hi.

35:27.554 --> 35:30.058
Hi!
How was it?

35:30.058 --> 35:31.962
It was good.
It was good, yeah.

35:31.962 --> 35:33.331
How were the kids?

35:33.331 --> 35:36.271
Oh, we had so much fun.
Really?

35:36.271 --> 35:39.076
Oh, you have a friend?

35:39.076 --> 35:40.345
Libby Slater?

35:40.345 --> 35:42.316
Yeah, it's me.
Hi, Cherry.

35:42.316 --> 35:43.752
Hi.
Hey.

35:43.752 --> 35:45.823
Wow, I didn't know
you were divorced.

35:45.823 --> 35:47.694
I'm not.

35:47.694 --> 35:50.198
She's just coming
to pee.

35:50.198 --> 35:51.868
Yeah, thanks.

35:55.910 --> 35:57.213
Toby?

35:57.213 --> 35:59.584
Shh.
You can let yourself out.

36:02.155 --> 36:03.892
Can you order a car
or something?

36:03.892 --> 36:05.696
It's late.

36:05.696 --> 36:10.506
Do you remember that guy, David,
that I went out with that year?

36:10.506 --> 36:13.444
Yeah, yeah.
The one with the harmonica?

36:13.444 --> 36:16.150
Yeah, the harmonica.

36:16.150 --> 36:19.891
Well, sometimes I used to wonder
what happened to that guy.

36:19.891 --> 36:21.528
Right, 'cause I never knew.

36:21.528 --> 36:22.897
Okay.

36:22.897 --> 36:28.408
And then, tonight, Tracy told me
that he is an accountant.

36:28.408 --> 36:31.079
And he's married
to an English teacher.

36:31.079 --> 36:33.618
And they live
in Scarsdale.

36:33.618 --> 36:34.888
Wow.

36:34.888 --> 36:36.759
You could have figured
this all out on Facebook.

36:36.759 --> 36:39.397
No, I never
looked him up.

36:39.397 --> 36:41.200
Because I didn't
want to know.

36:41.200 --> 36:45.275
You know, I wanted-- I wanted
to think of him alone out there,

36:45.275 --> 36:48.214
same as the day
that we broke up.

36:48.214 --> 36:50.418
This unknown legend.

36:52.657 --> 36:55.563
We don't have any overlapping
friends, so it was possible.

36:55.563 --> 36:57.633
Hey, hey. What are you doing?
No, you can't smoke in here.

36:57.633 --> 37:00.304
Toby, just one.
Come on.

37:07.286 --> 37:09.791
Blow it out the window. Yeah.

37:16.839 --> 37:18.809
Do you remember when Facebook
first came out and you,

37:18.809 --> 37:22.282
like, looked up every single
person that you ever knew,

37:22.282 --> 37:24.086
only to find out
that they all became

37:24.086 --> 37:27.292
the same basic adults
as their parents?

37:27.292 --> 37:31.100
Like,
they all had these...

37:31.100 --> 37:33.104
inevitable conclusions.

37:33.104 --> 37:35.275
To the point that the only
people who were interesting

37:35.275 --> 37:36.611
were the ones
who were smart enough

37:36.611 --> 37:38.147
not to diminish
their own legends

37:38.147 --> 37:41.721
by going on fucking Facebook
in the first place.

37:48.368 --> 37:51.575
How did we all
get this way?

37:51.575 --> 37:55.114
How did we all get put
on this trajectory

37:55.114 --> 37:58.755
where we all ended up with
the same boring life, you know?

38:01.594 --> 38:05.034
I miss longing.

38:05.034 --> 38:06.872
I miss...

38:06.872 --> 38:08.308
desire.

38:08.308 --> 38:10.245
And it's not Adam.

38:10.245 --> 38:12.349
Adam is great, okay?

38:12.349 --> 38:14.086
Like, Adam's
the best-case scenario

38:14.086 --> 38:15.522
in a very flawed system.

38:15.522 --> 38:18.695
But the way that it works,
the way desire works

38:18.695 --> 38:21.501
and longing works
is you cannot get the thing.

38:21.501 --> 38:22.870
Because then if you
get the thing--

38:22.870 --> 38:25.275
All right, all right.
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

38:25.275 --> 38:26.612
When you get the thing,

38:26.612 --> 38:28.314
you don't get to feel
those feelings anymore.

38:28.314 --> 38:33.090
Am I the only one that
enjoyed feeling those feelings?

38:43.545 --> 38:45.481
I'm just, I'm worried
that the only way

38:45.481 --> 38:48.087
that I can feel anything...

38:48.087 --> 38:50.893
is when things are very bad.

38:52.997 --> 38:56.504
And I just don't know
where that leads, you know?

39:01.079 --> 39:04.887
I just think that there's
something wrong with me, Tobe.

39:09.063 --> 39:12.402
I wasn't always like this,
was I?

39:21.554 --> 39:23.224
God, forget it.

39:24.894 --> 39:27.566
Honestly, forget it.
Let's not even talk about it.

39:27.566 --> 39:30.372
Talking about it doesn't
make it any better, so...

40:52.168 --> 40:54.306
Dad?

40:54.306 --> 40:56.712
Dad!
Dad!

40:56.712 --> 40:59.482
Oh, shit.
Solly!

41:01.688 --> 41:03.424
Hey, hey.
What happened?

41:03.424 --> 41:04.761
I went in the bed.

41:04.761 --> 41:06.196
Hey, it's okay.
It's fine. It happens.

41:06.196 --> 41:08.500
I'm so sorry.
Are you kidding?
Don't apologize.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.271
Oh, my God.
What is going on?

41:10.271 --> 41:11.507
Nothing.
Nothing.

41:11.507 --> 41:13.010
Just wait here.
I'll be right back.

41:13.010 --> 41:14.446
Okay.

41:14.446 --> 41:16.183
Can I do anything?
What? No.

41:16.183 --> 41:18.154
Libby, get out of here.
Hey, Solly?

41:18.154 --> 41:19.824
Miles wets the bed--
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

41:19.824 --> 41:21.595
No one needs your help
right now. Please, leave.

41:21.595 --> 41:24.299
Thank you very much.
Go, go, go. Hey.

41:41.868 --> 41:44.173
<i>There was no use
in going home like this.</i>

41:49.048 --> 41:53.090
<i>I made a mess, and the cleanup
already felt impossible.</i>

41:56.732 --> 41:58.233
<i>Left to my own devices,</i>

41:58.233 --> 42:02.275
<i>I always returned
to the museum of my youth.</i>

42:02.275 --> 42:05.583
<i>Trying to find the last place
I'd seen myself.</i>

42:13.497 --> 42:16.036
Hey, how's it going?

42:16.036 --> 42:19.376
Um, one for
"The Virgin Suicides."

42:39.517 --> 42:43.057
So they have a dinner
for Scott...

42:43.057 --> 42:46.631
Maybe you can figure
out a time...

42:48.434 --> 42:52.275
<i>I'd met Glenn at the magazine.</i>

42:52.275 --> 42:54.012
<i>He was nothing special.</i>

42:56.684 --> 42:58.020
Archer killed it
with this...

42:58.020 --> 42:59.422
<i>None of the guys
I worked with were.</i>

42:59.422 --> 43:00.659
He murdered it.

43:00.659 --> 43:01.995
He crushed it.

43:01.995 --> 43:04.099
He was a general with
his foot on the neck

43:04.099 --> 43:05.870
of the village
he conquered.

43:05.870 --> 43:07.372
He's a barbarian.

43:07.372 --> 43:11.080
<i>They used war language
to describe writing.</i>

43:11.080 --> 43:13.618
<i>I'll tell you,
if the American man ever saw</i>

43:13.618 --> 43:16.490
<i>who was in charge of
defining masculinity for him,</i>

43:16.490 --> 43:20.599
<i>he would seriously reconsider
his subscription.</i>

43:20.599 --> 43:24.172
<i>But this moment in my life
was not about Glenn.</i>

43:24.172 --> 43:26.176
<i>It was about me.</i>

43:29.717 --> 43:33.391
<i>I didn't so much love him
as want to be part of him,</i>

43:33.391 --> 43:35.161
<i>to eat him, to become him.</i>

43:35.161 --> 43:37.165
And you've got to be rigorous.

43:37.165 --> 43:40.639
<i>You have to understand,
I was never wild.</i>

43:40.639 --> 43:42.876
<i>I didn't have affairs.</i>

43:42.876 --> 43:44.379
<i>I didn't have good judgement</i>

43:44.379 --> 43:47.987
<i>because I didn't have
any experience.</i>

43:47.987 --> 43:50.458
<i>But I wanted what he had.</i>

43:50.458 --> 43:53.999
<i>I wanted to really
participate in life.</i>

43:53.999 --> 43:55.468
<i>I wanted to eat the world
the way</i>

43:55.468 --> 43:59.076
<i>he and every other guy
at the magazine did.</i>

44:03.986 --> 44:06.090
<i>I went about it the wrong way.</i>

44:09.229 --> 44:10.431
Sorry, I gotta go.

44:10.431 --> 44:11.735
I used to blow smoke on him

44:11.735 --> 44:14.072
so his wife would know
where he'd been.

44:23.457 --> 44:26.864
Oh, she was lovely.
Yeah, it was great.

44:28.935 --> 44:31.040
<i>I didn't realize
the real power I had</i>

44:31.040 --> 44:33.778
<i>was that I had no obligations.</i>

44:35.849 --> 44:37.185
<i>I could do whatever the hell
I wanted.</i>

44:37.185 --> 44:41.293
I definitely want to get
more involved, for sure.

44:41.293 --> 44:43.197
<i>How was I supposed to know
that, one day,</i>

44:43.197 --> 44:45.936
<i>in seeking the safety
of a grown-up life,</i>

44:45.936 --> 44:48.140
<i>I would lose that power?</i>

44:50.645 --> 44:53.017
<i>I am 41 now.</i>

44:53.017 --> 44:56.056
<i>I can't believe how briefly
I held that power.</i>

44:56.056 --> 45:00.064
<i>I can't believe how briefly
I held it</i>

45:00.064 --> 45:02.168
<i>and how quickly
I gave it away.</i>

45:09.149 --> 45:12.523
<i>I'd been smoking pot
a lot recently.</i>

45:12.523 --> 45:14.392
<i>I hadn't done that in years.</i>

45:16.430 --> 45:17.967
<i>I thought about that thing
Seth said</i>

45:17.967 --> 45:19.470
<i>about how people
have affairs</i>

45:19.470 --> 45:21.607
<i>not because they're
betraying their spouses,</i>

45:21.607 --> 45:23.243
<i>but because they're trying
to remember</i>

45:23.243 --> 45:25.414
<i>who they were
in the first place.</i>

45:25.414 --> 45:27.587
<i>I thought about that
a lot lately.</i>

45:27.587 --> 45:29.323
Hey.
Hi.

45:29.323 --> 45:31.293
How was your day?

45:31.293 --> 45:33.632
It was fine.

45:33.632 --> 45:35.870
I don't remember.

45:35.870 --> 45:37.806
So, just like
yesterday, huh?

45:41.948 --> 45:44.553
Hey, there.

45:44.553 --> 45:46.591
Uh, yeah. I know we
need to figure it out.

45:46.591 --> 45:48.027
Uh, I just got home.

45:48.027 --> 45:51.601
Let me, uh,
get my memo out.

45:51.601 --> 45:55.341
If he perjured himself,
I owe you a cup of soup.

45:55.341 --> 45:57.312
Okay, all right.

45:57.312 --> 46:00.619
<i>That's probably why Glenn was
doing what he had been doing--</i>

46:00.619 --> 46:03.592
<i>it was certainly why I was
doing what I was doing now.</i>

46:07.733 --> 46:09.268
<i>Only there's no affair.</i>

46:09.268 --> 46:12.543
<i>No clandestine meetings
in stairwells.</i>

46:12.543 --> 46:14.345
<i>There's just a cigarette
in the city</i>

46:14.345 --> 46:16.283
<i>where I lived
when I was young.</i>

46:19.990 --> 46:23.263
<i>How poorly I wear this life.</i>

46:23.263 --> 46:25.736
<i>How the adjustment to it
is taking so long</i>

46:25.736 --> 46:29.677
<i>I've started to feel like it
isn't coming soon.</i>

46:29.677 --> 46:31.648
<i>It isn't coming ever.</i>

46:31.648 --> 46:35.354
<i>It was never coming.</i>

46:35.354 --> 46:37.526
<i>This is what I was saying
about questions</i>

46:37.526 --> 46:40.799
<i>that can't be answered.</i>

46:40.799 --> 46:42.569
<i>"Is life fair?"</i>

46:42.569 --> 46:44.206
<i>"How did I get here?"</i>

46:47.847 --> 46:50.919
<i>Trust me.</i>

46:50.919 --> 46:53.123
<i>You shouldn't ask them.</i>
