Uma!

10:16.198 --> 10:17.783
I'M Pascal.

The real Pascal.

10:19.744 --> 10:20.953
What?!

10:21.037 --> 10:22.747
I was afraid my tiny body
would disappoint you,

10:22.830 --> 10:25.374
so I enlisted
this average looking,

10:25.458 --> 10:29.253
but ultimately unlikable whale
to pose as me and...

10:29.337 --> 10:31.797
I'm so sorry.
Oh, Pascal...

10:31.881 --> 10:34.133
you should have just been
honest from the start.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.384
I really liked you.

Can ya give me
a second chance?

10:38.220 --> 10:39.805
Ah, ha-ha, no.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.558
What you did was
pretty dishonest and horrible.

Not at all romantic
or comedic.

Ha! Because you're a Fungie,
and Uma wants a real whale.

And you, you just
went along with it?

10:51.984 --> 10:54.362
You're the worst whale
I've ever met.

10:54.445 --> 10:57.740
Goodbye, Pascal. Call me when
you get some confidence!
