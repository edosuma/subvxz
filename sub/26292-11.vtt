WEBVTT

00:31.118 --> 00:32.684
- Dr. Ryan to Pediatrics.

00:32.728 --> 00:35.687
Dr. Ryan to Pediatrics.

00:38.429 --> 00:40.605
- There he is.
- Hey.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.433
- Right on time.
- Reporting for duty.

00:42.477 --> 00:44.522
- I half expected I'd have
to physically drag you out

00:44.566 --> 00:46.133
of your office.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.482
Have you met the group?

00:47.525 --> 00:49.571
- Uh--uh, no actually, uh--

00:49.614 --> 00:51.051
- Come. Don't be shy.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.791
Morning everyone.
- Morning.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.228
- Hey.
- This is Max.

00:54.271 --> 00:56.273
It's his first day, so...
- Yeah.

00:56.317 --> 00:57.622
- Why are you in scrubs?

00:57.666 --> 01:00.060
- Oh, uh, I'm a doctor.
- Mm, where?

01:00.103 --> 01:01.452
- Here.
- Nice.

01:01.496 --> 01:03.367
I wish I could do chemo
at Whole Foods,

01:03.411 --> 01:05.543
but we're not even allowed
to use our phones.

01:05.587 --> 01:06.718
- Mm-hmm.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.285
- Uh, Max, this is Mr. Kiggens.

01:08.329 --> 01:09.721
- "Big Mike."
- Yeah, clearly.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.114
- That's Willow.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.376
- Smart, bringing
your own food.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.074
No one delivers here.
- Really?

01:14.117 --> 01:15.118
- And Millie.

01:15.162 --> 01:17.425
- Don't be scared, Max.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.079
We don't bite.

01:19.122 --> 01:21.603
- Uh, no, that's--thank you,
but I'm not, uh--

01:21.646 --> 01:22.734
I'm not scared.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.345
- Okay.

01:24.388 --> 01:25.868
Hey, you know,
why don't you join us?

01:25.911 --> 01:27.565
We need a fourth
for euchre.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.306
- You know, I would love to,
but I actually got

01:29.350 --> 01:30.742
the, uh, to-go chemo.

01:30.786 --> 01:32.135
It's fewer calories, so...

01:32.179 --> 01:33.397
- Max, it's three hours.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.138
You can't stay put
for three hours?

01:35.182 --> 01:36.574
- Yeah, no, I would,
but you know me and sitting.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.185
It's just not a good--
have a good game.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.708
- Good luck out there.

01:43.233 --> 01:44.756
- You know, a doctor
with an IV pole

01:44.800 --> 01:46.584
is gonna frighten patients.

01:46.628 --> 01:47.716
- That's a good point.

01:47.759 --> 01:50.762
Why don't we just, uh, do this.

01:52.460 --> 01:53.504
There we go.

01:53.548 --> 01:55.724
Meet Earl, my new sidekick.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.378
- Oh, yeah, that's much better.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.206
- Right?
- A smiling bag of poison.

01:59.249 --> 02:00.381
- Yep, going full chemo.

02:00.424 --> 02:01.817
- Please don't say that.
- Got it.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.471
Uh...

02:03.514 --> 02:06.865
I know that at some point
I'm gonna be useless.

02:06.909 --> 02:08.563
Thanks for not disagreeing.

02:08.606 --> 02:10.260
- Well, we both know
what's coming.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.914
- And, uh, after what happened
in Cold Spring,

02:11.957 --> 02:13.524
I can't just let
the hospital fall apart.

02:13.568 --> 02:14.917
I mean, I need
to find someone

02:14.960 --> 02:17.572
who can, you know,
take--take over

02:17.615 --> 02:20.618
when I'm, uh--
when I can't...

02:22.446 --> 02:25.928
Will--will you be
my deputy Medical Director?

02:25.971 --> 02:27.451
Sorry, I don't know why
that sounded like

02:27.495 --> 02:29.279
I was asking you to prom.

02:31.499 --> 02:35.416
- I'm flattered, of course.

02:35.459 --> 02:38.158
- My friend Earl, here, doesn't
think you look flattered.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.508
- I've already cut back
on my public appearances.

02:40.551 --> 02:41.900
If I cut back anymore,
we're gonna start

02:41.944 --> 02:43.293
to lose funding.

02:43.337 --> 02:44.338
- Okay, yeah.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.296
Well, think about it.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.472
Otherwise I'm gonna have
to give my friend Earl, here,

02:48.516 --> 02:50.561
a sad face.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.483
- Uh, was, uh, that
our Medical Director

02:59.527 --> 03:01.311
attached to an IV
of cis-platinum?

03:01.355 --> 03:03.444
- Don't ask.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.228
Why are you here?

03:05.272 --> 03:06.751
- Uh, tough one.

03:06.795 --> 03:09.319
Uh, because this is a hospital
and I'm a doctor.

03:09.363 --> 03:12.583
- You said that you were gonna
take some time off.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.237
- Well, that was before.

03:14.281 --> 03:17.762
I mean, Max needs
my help, clearly.

03:17.806 --> 03:20.243
- Sweetheart,
this is important.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.679
You need to take care
of yourself.

03:21.723 --> 03:24.291
- And I am going to, okay?

03:24.334 --> 03:27.598
I'm just gonna do it without
leaving the hospital.

03:27.642 --> 03:29.383
I flushed all my pills
this morning.

03:29.426 --> 03:31.341
You know I'm going cold turkey?

03:31.385 --> 03:32.951
Yes, it is gonna suck
for a while,

03:32.995 --> 03:35.302
but it's what I need to do.

03:35.345 --> 03:37.260
And not just for me.
For Max.

03:38.392 --> 03:39.393
Oh.

03:39.436 --> 03:42.570
Ooh, triage.
Gotta run.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.536
Damn it, Andy.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.495
Triage said an acute
coronary syndrome in here.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.975
- I did not use those words
'cause I don't know them,

03:57.019 --> 03:58.890
but it had to sound serious

03:58.934 --> 04:00.762
or they would have given me
to one of your residents.

04:00.805 --> 04:03.852
- Yeah, well, you nearly
gave me an acute coronary.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.897
- Did you do something new
with your hair?

04:05.941 --> 04:08.335
- All right, Andy,
what's the story?

04:08.378 --> 04:10.250
- My knee's been swelling up.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.556
I can't move it without--

04:12.600 --> 04:15.342
- Patel, uh, let's--
let's drain Andy's knee.

04:15.385 --> 04:17.387
- Hey, take your time, LB.

04:17.431 --> 04:19.259
Clean sheets.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.608
Yeah.

04:26.962 --> 04:31.271
- Tony, I know it's difficult
to talk about the attack but...

04:31.314 --> 04:33.621
we should.

04:35.971 --> 04:38.278
- Um...

04:39.453 --> 04:43.065
I was painting up in Mohonk.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.328
Lots of light.

04:45.372 --> 04:48.636
My dad came with me,
so I was annoyed.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.856
I--I'd wanted to go solo.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.032
But it's good he was there,

04:54.076 --> 04:57.906
'cause when I moved my easel
near the tree line, I...

04:57.949 --> 05:00.300
I saw this shape.

05:00.343 --> 05:01.997
- Okay.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.304
Tell me more about that.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.480
- It was daytime.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.917
They're nocturnal, right?

05:08.960 --> 05:10.832
- Yeah.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.964
- It shouldn't have been there.

05:14.966 --> 05:17.404
But I saw it, and it just--

05:17.447 --> 05:19.493
it just stared at me.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.016
- Mm.

05:21.059 --> 05:23.061
- And then
it started running...

05:23.105 --> 05:25.063
right at me...

05:25.107 --> 05:28.371
And then I turned and ran,
and I'm fast.

05:28.415 --> 05:31.548
I used to run track,
but I didn't make it two feet.

05:33.028 --> 05:35.378
Before it--before it...

05:37.859 --> 05:39.817
- So...

05:39.861 --> 05:42.733
before this most recent attack,
you hadn't seen the wolf

05:42.777 --> 05:45.562
in over a month, correct?

05:45.606 --> 05:47.521
- Uh...

05:49.958 --> 05:51.960
- Yeah.

05:53.918 --> 05:57.400
Hey, Tony, is the, um...

05:57.444 --> 05:59.881
is the wolf here right now?

06:14.069 --> 06:16.027
Okay, all right.
Here's what we're gonna do:

06:16.071 --> 06:17.681
I am gonna go get your dad,

06:17.725 --> 06:20.728
and we are going
to talk next steps.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.686
Okay?

06:22.730 --> 06:25.428
- Right.
- Okay.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.961
- Oh, my God, this is Rohan.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.920
I mean, I thought it might be
because he has the same--

06:38.963 --> 06:40.791
but I didn't to--

06:40.835 --> 06:42.184
okay, I'm done.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.708
both: Hi.
- Uh, it's so nice to meet you.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.536
Your dad talks about you
all the time.

06:46.580 --> 06:47.842
- He does?

06:47.885 --> 06:50.018
- Okay, thank you.
Thank you, Ella.

06:50.061 --> 06:53.064
- Now he's blushing,
so this is a disaster.

06:53.108 --> 06:56.851
I'm gonna go, but I hope
I see you again.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.464
- You talk about me?

07:01.508 --> 07:02.900
- Uh, yes.

07:02.944 --> 07:05.729
I wanted to get you a gift,
and Ella was helping me.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.035
- What kind of gift?

07:07.078 --> 07:08.993
- We've not decided,
but I didn't want

07:09.037 --> 07:10.734
to get you something
which meant something

07:10.778 --> 07:13.084
other than what I wanted it
to mean.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.086
- Oh, that's--

07:15.130 --> 07:18.089
that's thoughtful.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.569
There is something...

07:19.613 --> 07:21.179
- Yes, tell me.

07:21.223 --> 07:22.659
- I told you about
the songs I'm writing?

07:22.703 --> 07:24.748
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I'd love to make a demo,

07:24.792 --> 07:28.752
and do that,
I need to rent a studio.

07:28.796 --> 07:31.233
I was wondering if you could,
you know...

07:31.276 --> 07:33.540
- Give you money?

07:34.802 --> 07:37.500
I don't think it's a good idea.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.503
- Okay.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.897
Okay.
Baby steps, right?

07:49.817 --> 07:52.254
- LB.
- How's that knee doing?

07:52.297 --> 07:53.777
- Eh, it's better.
- Oh.

07:53.821 --> 07:54.996
So why are you still here?

07:55.039 --> 07:56.954
- I meant better than bad,

07:56.998 --> 07:58.652
which is still, you know,
not good.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.175
- All right, Andy.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.830
Why don't you tell me
what's really going on?

08:04.571 --> 08:07.791
- My shelter voucher
doesn't start till Saturday,

08:07.835 --> 08:09.532
so I got four days
on the streets.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.012
So I thought...

08:11.055 --> 08:12.970
- We're a hospital, okay?

08:13.014 --> 08:14.494
You don't warrant
an overnight stay.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.583
- Yet.
Just do some more digging.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.236
There's gotta be something else
wrong with me.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.717
I'm a very unhealthy person.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.240
- You paged?

08:22.284 --> 08:23.546
- Uh, yeah.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.940
Yeah, is, uh, now a bad time?

08:25.983 --> 08:27.202
For both of you?

08:27.245 --> 08:28.856
- Oh, yeah.
What do you got?

08:28.899 --> 08:30.118
- You said you wanted to know
the next time

08:30.161 --> 08:31.772
a frequent flyer came in.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.077
- Yeah, frequent flyers mean
we're not doing our job.

08:33.121 --> 08:34.731
- Oh, well,
then you're in luck

08:34.775 --> 08:37.517
Meet the Amelia Earhart
of frequent flyers:

08:37.560 --> 08:39.257
Andy Keener.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.654
- How can I help?

08:44.698 --> 08:48.310
- Looking good, Dr. Reynolds.
Just hold it there.

08:48.353 --> 08:50.007
Fantastic.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.792
That's perfect.
Thanks, Chris.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.228
That was great.

08:53.271 --> 08:55.099
This is going
to come together seamlessly.

08:55.143 --> 08:56.753
- I thought Fred Niemens
usually does

08:56.797 --> 08:58.842
the, uh, medical articles?

08:58.886 --> 09:01.671
- My editor thought
the personal angle

09:01.715 --> 09:03.847
would be better
for "The Face of Diversity."

09:03.891 --> 09:05.545
- Is that the angle?

09:05.588 --> 09:07.285
- I figured we'd start
with a profile on you

09:07.329 --> 09:09.026
and then talk about how you've
put together your department.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.332
- Okay.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.594
- For your profile,
I was thinking

09:11.638 --> 09:12.856
it's a "rags to riches" story.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.162
I already know the layout.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.903
Just below the headline,
there'll be

09:15.946 --> 09:18.862
these two pictures of you
where you are now

09:18.906 --> 09:20.908
right next to this:

09:24.085 --> 09:26.130
I wanna know the details of what
led to the mug shot so we can--

09:26.174 --> 09:27.871
- This interview is over.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.091
- Wait--

09:33.355 --> 09:36.924
Um, sorry, I didn't mean...

09:43.974 --> 09:46.107
- Your chemo bag
is making people nervous.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.718
- Yeah, sorry,
just one more hour.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.633
- And by "people," I mean me.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.983
- Did you know that Andy Keener
has been in this hospital

09:53.027 --> 09:54.115
over 100 times?

09:54.158 --> 09:55.769
- He's a frequent flyer.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.292
- If my math is correct--
and I'm pretty sure

09:57.335 --> 09:59.337
that it is--Andy Keener
has cost New Amsterdam

09:59.381 --> 10:02.776
$1.4 million dollars this year.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.651
And we haven't done a thing
to help him.

10:12.437 --> 10:15.353
- Andy Keener has rung up
over $1 million in charges

10:15.397 --> 10:16.746
here at New Amsterdam.

10:16.790 --> 10:19.401
That is enough for 50,000
prenatal visits,

10:19.444 --> 10:20.924
two liver transplants,

10:20.968 --> 10:24.319
or, you know, one NBA contract.

10:24.362 --> 10:27.670
How do we lower this number
right there?

10:30.238 --> 10:31.674
- Don't look at me.

10:31.718 --> 10:32.893
- Well, he's had over 30 visits
and three surgeries

10:32.936 --> 10:33.937
for a foot ulcer.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.417
- He walks around all day.

10:35.460 --> 10:36.940
He can't keep
his foot elevated.

10:36.984 --> 10:39.334
Look, bandages fall off,
antibiotic creams get lost.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.683
- Okay, Bloom.
ED's number one

10:40.727 --> 10:42.642
on the hospital encounters
hit parade.

10:42.685 --> 10:45.557
- My ED is open 24/7,
so if he wants to get out

10:45.601 --> 10:48.343
of the rain, or snow, or sun,
or get a hot meal, then--

10:48.386 --> 10:50.867
- Got it.
Neurology: 10 EEGs

10:50.911 --> 10:53.827
and 18 head CT scans
this year alone.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.785
- All indicated and necessary.

10:55.829 --> 10:58.614
Andy falls, and gets beaten up,
and has a withdrawal seizure.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.920
EMTs bring him in

10:59.963 --> 11:01.573
and we give him
the same evaluation

11:01.617 --> 11:03.184
we would give to anyone else.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.620
- Yeah, Helen,
you can't tell me

11:04.664 --> 11:06.317
that all these biopsies
were necessary.

11:06.361 --> 11:07.797
- Well, if we don't have
a patient's family history

11:07.841 --> 11:09.843
then all concerns have
to be taken seriously.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.453
- Psychiatry, help me out.

11:11.496 --> 11:12.846
There's gotta be a way
to save a dollar.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.543
Just one dollar.

11:14.586 --> 11:15.892
- Uh, no.
No can do, Doc.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.938
Andy suffers from PTSD
and depression.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.504
An abusive childhood
will do that to you.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.332
Not to mention,
he is an alcoholic.

11:21.376 --> 11:23.204
Multiple detox stays.

11:23.247 --> 11:25.293
- Okay, so what everyone
is telling me

11:25.336 --> 11:26.947
is that not only
was there no way

11:26.990 --> 11:29.645
to avoid spending
$1.4 million

11:29.689 --> 11:32.561
on Andy Keener this year,
but apparently there's no way

11:32.604 --> 11:36.478
to avoid spending another
$1.4 million

11:36.521 --> 11:39.699
on Andy Kenner next year?

11:41.788 --> 11:43.224
Yes?

11:43.267 --> 11:44.921
- Yes, I was hoping
to meet Earl.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.793
Is Earl here?
Is he coming later?

11:46.836 --> 11:47.881
Not here, okay.

11:47.924 --> 11:49.404
- Hey, Max, hold up.

11:49.447 --> 11:50.579
- You got a fix
for Andy Keener?

11:50.622 --> 11:52.537
- No, apparently I missed

11:52.581 --> 11:54.496
the Solve-America's-Homeless-
Epidemic class in med school.

11:54.539 --> 11:55.932
- Fair enough.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.499
- All right, so, uh, look--
a reporter from

11:57.542 --> 11:58.892
"The New England
Cardiothoracic Journal"

11:58.935 --> 12:00.720
dug up some dirt on me.

12:00.763 --> 12:03.766
Some dirt that--that could
embarrass the hospital.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.681
- Define "dirt."

12:05.725 --> 12:08.945
- Ten years ago
I was arrested and, um...

12:08.989 --> 12:11.731
she wants to print my mug shot.

12:11.774 --> 12:13.428
Every time I think
this is dead and buried

12:13.471 --> 12:14.908
it just keeps popping
back up in my life,

12:14.951 --> 12:16.779
and I never wanted
to be a burden to you

12:16.823 --> 12:17.911
or this hospital.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.695
- You're not.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.784
You wanna tell me
what happened?

12:21.828 --> 12:23.568
- Do I have to?

12:23.612 --> 12:26.789
- Well, if I knew the story
would I trust you less?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.443
- No.

12:28.486 --> 12:29.705
- Would it make me think less
of you as a surgeon?

12:29.749 --> 12:31.533
- No.

12:31.576 --> 12:34.536
- Then I don't need to know,
and neither does anybody else.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.887
- I just don't want anyone
to think less of me.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.802
Patients, colleagues--
- They won't.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.370
Let's go full chemo on this.
- "Full chemo"?

12:42.413 --> 12:45.634
- Let's get legal
to bring down the hammer.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.679
- I wanna keep him overnight
for observation.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.594
The, um...

12:49.638 --> 12:52.467
the delusions are back,
full-on.

12:52.510 --> 12:55.383
I'm--I'm so sorry, Hector.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.823
- This last attack,

13:00.867 --> 13:03.695
he was screaming.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.352
Clawing at his throat.

13:10.093 --> 13:12.748
He thought he was dying.

13:13.923 --> 13:17.361
My little boy.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.842
How's he supposed
to live like this?

13:21.626 --> 13:23.846
I mean, what's he gonna do
when I'm gone?

13:25.717 --> 13:28.633
I--I've been reading about, uh,

13:28.677 --> 13:30.853
"deep brain stimulation"?

13:30.897 --> 13:33.029
- Deep brain stimulation
is not designed

13:33.073 --> 13:34.857
for psychological issues.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.685
It's for, um--
it's for Parkinson's.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.382
It's people with
physical ailments.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.776
- But there's trials
happening right now.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.473
- Yes, Hector.

13:42.517 --> 13:45.041
A--a handful of patients
with delusional disorders

13:45.085 --> 13:47.130
have tried it, but...

13:47.174 --> 13:49.829
you know, the side effects
are not--

13:49.872 --> 13:52.701
we're--we're not talking
scars, here.

13:52.744 --> 13:55.965
The kind, funny, artistic son

13:56.009 --> 13:58.794
that you know and love
right now?

13:58.838 --> 14:01.710
It can change
Tony's personality.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.627
- Ativan...

14:05.670 --> 14:08.543
Paxil, Klonopin...

14:08.586 --> 14:10.850
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.982
Hypnosis, ECT.

14:13.026 --> 14:15.898
Electricity shooting through
my cariño'sbrain.

14:17.726 --> 14:20.685
That hasn't changed him?

14:20.729 --> 14:23.079
'Cause it has.

14:27.518 --> 14:30.739
- We can try
a compassionate-use trial.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.567
But, Hector, you--
you gotta know

14:32.610 --> 14:35.831
that if you send your son in
for this surgery...

14:35.875 --> 14:39.791
you may not recognize
the person that you get back.

14:39.835 --> 14:42.490
Do you understand?

14:44.622 --> 14:47.756
- If helping him means
losing some of him...

14:48.975 --> 14:51.716
Parts of him I love...

14:51.760 --> 14:53.718
I'll pay the price.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.946
- Hey, there.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.121
You okay?

15:05.165 --> 15:06.906
- No.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.429
Got a migraine.

15:08.472 --> 15:11.040
Among other things.

15:11.084 --> 15:12.737
Did we--did we page you?

15:12.781 --> 15:13.913
- No.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.697
No, I just got you
some ginger tea.

15:15.740 --> 15:16.785
- Okay.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.091
Why?

15:18.134 --> 15:21.529
- Because ginger
is a miracle cure-all

15:21.572 --> 15:23.705
for the whole system.

15:23.748 --> 15:26.577
- Wait, are you monitoring me?

15:26.621 --> 15:27.665
- No.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.798
I'm just checking up on you.

15:29.841 --> 15:32.061
- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
I was an adult.

15:32.105 --> 15:34.150
I didn't realize I needed
a babysitter.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.457
- Lauren--
- You know what, don't, okay?

15:36.500 --> 15:37.893
I am leaving now.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.069
Because, you know,
I've got an ED to run.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.250
♪ Born in sun

15:47.294 --> 15:50.645
♪ Feel the pull
from inside of you ♪

15:50.688 --> 15:53.039
♪ The world's behind

15:53.082 --> 15:54.997
- Oh, hey.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.651
- Hey.

15:56.694 --> 15:57.782
- Ella, right?

15:57.826 --> 15:59.045
- Yeah.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.698
Are you, uh, waiting
for your dad?

16:00.742 --> 16:02.135
- Oh, no.

16:02.178 --> 16:03.745
Just taking advantage
of the free Wi-Fi.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.834
Have a seat.
- Thanks.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.925
What are you writing?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.144
- Nothing.

16:11.187 --> 16:12.754
- Oh, no, come on.

16:12.797 --> 16:15.539
We've known each other
a whole two minutes now.

16:16.671 --> 16:18.803
- I'm a song writer.

16:20.109 --> 16:23.286
Go ahead,
take your best shot.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.940
- Oh, I should have known
your dad would raise

16:24.984 --> 16:26.898
the sensitive, artistic type.

16:26.942 --> 16:29.118
- Back then he didn't do
much raising.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.033
- Right, sorry.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.862
He, uh--he's just been
so generous with me.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.211
I didn't mean to--
- "Generous"?

16:35.255 --> 16:36.821
How?

16:36.865 --> 16:39.259
- Um, like how he totally saved
my dog's life.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.043
My dad's still

16:41.087 --> 16:42.566
a human neurologist, right?

16:42.610 --> 16:44.177
Yep.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.831
But, uh, he paid
for my dog's surgery.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.705
- He did?
- Yeah.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.924
Gave me $2,000.

16:52.968 --> 16:55.275
I didn't even have to ask.

16:58.756 --> 17:01.063
- Wow.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.240
- Bloom?

17:04.284 --> 17:05.720
We've been trying
to help Andy Keener

17:05.763 --> 17:07.809
entirely the wrong way.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.072
- Are you screaming right now,
or is it just me?

17:10.116 --> 17:12.553
- I figured out
what to give him.

17:12.596 --> 17:14.163
Andy?
- MG.

17:14.207 --> 17:17.340
- Um, we have done you
a great disservice.

17:17.384 --> 17:20.082
- You guys have
the best service in New York.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.866
- Every time you've come
to this hospital,

17:21.910 --> 17:24.739
we have focused on treating
a whole host of symptoms.

17:24.782 --> 17:27.611
- I--I'd give you five stars
on Yelp if I had a computer.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.787
- That ends today.
Scripts?

17:29.831 --> 17:31.702
The, uh, fatigue, stress,

17:31.746 --> 17:34.662
heart arrhythmia, malnutrition,
you name it--

17:34.705 --> 17:36.229
each of these symptoms
is the result

17:36.272 --> 17:39.710
of you not having
a stable living environment.

17:39.754 --> 17:42.104
This cure will fix all of that.

17:42.148 --> 17:45.064
Mr. Keener...

17:45.107 --> 17:47.327
I am prescribing you a home.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.482
- Morning.
- Morning.

18:12.526 --> 18:14.484
- Max in yet?
- Haven't seen him.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.486
- Day two can hit you
like a ton of bricks.

18:16.530 --> 18:17.835
He might still be in bed.

18:17.879 --> 18:18.836
- Okay.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.577
Well, if you do see him--

18:20.621 --> 18:21.970
- I made it, I'm here.
Sorry.

18:22.013 --> 18:23.493
I made it.
Call off the dogs.

18:23.537 --> 18:24.668
- How do you feel?

18:24.712 --> 18:26.192
- Oh, like a million bucks

18:26.235 --> 18:27.845
that was shoved
dollar by dollar

18:27.889 --> 18:29.325
through an industrial shredder

18:29.369 --> 18:32.328
and then set on fire
with a blowtorch.

18:32.372 --> 18:34.417
- Your feet, huh?
- Points for Big Mike.

18:34.461 --> 18:36.245
Swollen and sore.
Thank you.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.465
- You should borrow some Crocs
from the nurses' stash.

18:38.508 --> 18:41.729
They're super ugly
but they do make a difference.

18:41.772 --> 18:44.297
- And then you should--
you should sit down.

18:44.340 --> 18:45.907
You should join us for euchre.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.604
We could still use a fourth.

18:47.648 --> 18:48.997
- Appreciate
the generous offer, Millie,

18:49.040 --> 18:51.521
but this hospital
never sleeps, so...

18:51.565 --> 18:52.522
Back at it.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.611
I'm going mobile again.

18:54.655 --> 18:55.873
- Max.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.527
They know what
they're talking about.

18:57.571 --> 18:59.399
You should listen.

19:01.923 --> 19:04.447
- Well, Willow was right.
They are ugly.

19:04.491 --> 19:06.580
But man, I feel like
I'm walking on clouds.

19:06.623 --> 19:08.408
- Mm.
And Earl is shaping up...

19:08.451 --> 19:09.496
- I know, right?

19:09.539 --> 19:10.758
- To be far creepier

19:10.801 --> 19:12.499
than any plastic bag
has a right to be.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.283
- Now, that's just mean,
all right?

19:14.327 --> 19:16.198
Maybe he could use a hat.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.853
- I, um--I want you to know

19:18.896 --> 19:21.029
that I've truly considered
your offer...

19:21.072 --> 19:22.596
- Great.

19:22.639 --> 19:23.901
- And I--

19:23.945 --> 19:26.904
I can't be your deputy, Max.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.819
- Oh.

19:30.821 --> 19:33.737
- I'm barely maintaining
the commitments I already have,

19:33.781 --> 19:36.392
and as you know I'm knee-deep
in oocyte cryopreservation.

19:36.436 --> 19:37.741
When the time comes

19:37.785 --> 19:38.916
to move forward
with implantation--

19:38.960 --> 19:40.918
- I--I understand, I do.

19:40.962 --> 19:42.790
What about Bloom?

19:42.833 --> 19:45.532
- Bloom?
- Yeah, she's reliable.

19:45.575 --> 19:47.969
She's great under pressure.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.623
- Let me get back to you.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.755
- Okay.

19:53.801 --> 19:57.239
- ♪ The wheels on the bus
go round and round ♪

19:57.283 --> 19:59.415
♪ Round and round,
round and round ♪

19:59.459 --> 20:01.548
- So he really has
to be awake for this?

20:01.591 --> 20:03.376
- Yeah, yeah.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.682
It, uh--it reduces the risk
of damaging critical areas

20:05.726 --> 20:07.771
that control speech
and other skills.

20:07.815 --> 20:09.295
And we can't have him draw,

20:09.338 --> 20:11.079
so singing is
the next best thing.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.950
- ♪ Go round and round

20:12.994 --> 20:16.780
♪ Round and round,
round and round ♪

20:16.824 --> 20:17.955
- Very good, Tony.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.522
Keep going.

20:19.566 --> 20:23.309
- Advancing the wire.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.659
- ♪ The wheels on the bus
go round... ♪

20:25.702 --> 20:27.095
♪ And

20:27.138 --> 20:28.966
- Pull back.
- ♪ Round

20:31.534 --> 20:33.101
♪ Round and round

20:33.144 --> 20:34.972
♪ All through

20:35.016 --> 20:36.887
- Let's keep going.

20:38.585 --> 20:42.545
- You know, you've raised
an amazing young man.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.547
- For his 13th birthday,

20:44.591 --> 20:46.636
he begged me to take him
to the Uffizi.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.899
I mean, what kind of kid begs

20:48.943 --> 20:51.337
to go to the Uffizi, right?

20:51.380 --> 20:52.903
But I--I took him,

20:52.947 --> 20:56.472
and he marched straight up
to "The "Birth of Venus."

20:56.516 --> 20:58.648
Studied every detail.

20:58.692 --> 21:01.477
And he knew what he wanted
to be when he grew up.

21:02.913 --> 21:06.047
But then the wolf appeared.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.310
And never left.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.402
And all that potential...

21:13.446 --> 21:15.578
- I just--
I hope the wolf goes away

21:15.622 --> 21:17.972
so he can be that man again.

21:26.415 --> 21:28.504
- Max.

21:28.548 --> 21:30.463
You must really enjoy
putting me through this,

21:30.506 --> 21:32.116
because that is
the only explanation

21:32.160 --> 21:33.683
I can come up with.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.946
- Probably, but, uh,
what are we talking about?

21:35.990 --> 21:38.166
- Just explain to me
why I got a phone call

21:38.209 --> 21:39.820
from a landlord on First Avenue

21:39.863 --> 21:42.779
asking me if Andy Keener
has any pets.

21:42.823 --> 21:44.781
- Oh, that.
I can explain that.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.479
- Yeah, I sure hope you can.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.872
- Yeah, uh, since I've only
been here at New Amsterdam

21:48.916 --> 21:51.440
for a few weeks,
the landlord wouldn't let me

21:51.484 --> 21:52.702
cosign his lease.

21:52.746 --> 21:55.444
So, I, um, put your name down.

21:55.488 --> 21:56.619
- Did you?
- Yeah.

21:56.663 --> 21:58.099
- And who is Andy Keener,

21:58.142 --> 22:00.971
and why are we renting
an apartment for him?

22:01.015 --> 22:04.061
- Uh, Andy is a, um,
frequent flyer.

22:04.105 --> 22:06.020
His homelessness
has cost this hospital

22:06.063 --> 22:08.588
over $1 million
this year alone,

22:08.631 --> 22:10.067
and many of those costs
will go away

22:10.111 --> 22:12.809
if Andy simply has
a full-time place to stay.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.463
I mean, renting this man
an apartment

22:14.507 --> 22:16.639
is actually gonna save
this hospital money.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.859
- So you suddenly decided
to care about money.

22:18.902 --> 22:20.426
- Well, I care about money

22:20.469 --> 22:21.862
when it's only going
to one patient

22:21.905 --> 22:23.733
when it should
be going to thousands.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.605
- Right, so let's say I let
you do this--hypothetically.

22:25.648 --> 22:26.954
- Okay.

22:26.997 --> 22:28.564
- And we rent this apartment
for a year.

22:28.608 --> 22:29.913
- Right.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.393
- And then Andy gets back
on his feet

22:31.437 --> 22:33.090
and he pays for it himself,
right?

22:33.134 --> 22:36.093
- No, we would be paying
for it for a while.

22:36.137 --> 22:37.486
- How long is "a while"?

22:37.530 --> 22:40.097
- Just, you know, forever.

22:40.141 --> 22:41.708
- Oh, Max.
- No, look,

22:41.751 --> 22:43.579
I'm already solving
one enormous fiscal problem

22:43.623 --> 22:45.146
for this hospital.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.061
I can't also solve--
- This is socialism.

22:47.104 --> 22:49.063
This is exactly what's wrong

22:49.106 --> 22:50.760
with our whole
health care system.

22:50.804 --> 22:54.198
- You're right.
Somebody really should fix it.

22:54.242 --> 22:57.158
- So this guy abuses the system
and he gets a free apartment.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.551
What about all the other guys

22:58.594 --> 22:59.682
who are working
their asses off?

22:59.726 --> 23:01.249
You think this is fair to them?

23:01.292 --> 23:03.773
- It's not fair to them,
but it's smart business for us.

23:03.817 --> 23:06.907
We're talking about saving
over $1 million a year.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.778
That's $1 million
that could be spent

23:08.822 --> 23:11.172
on those very people who are
working their asses off.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.783
Who do deserve more.

23:19.572 --> 23:21.835
- Andy better not have
any pets.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.190
- Hey.
- Oh, no tea today?

23:29.233 --> 23:30.670
No tea.

23:30.713 --> 23:32.933
Just, uh, I'm sorry.

23:32.976 --> 23:35.022
You were right.
I was hovering.

23:35.065 --> 23:36.719
But that's not because
I don't trust you.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.765
I want to help you.

23:38.808 --> 23:40.767
I obviously have no idea
how to do that.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.072
Oh, that's all right.

23:42.116 --> 23:43.596
I know your people
like to think

23:43.639 --> 23:45.075
that tea fixes everything.

23:45.119 --> 23:46.642
- Wow.
- That was pretty good, right?

23:46.686 --> 23:48.818
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's a horrible accent.

23:49.993 --> 23:52.256
- So, look, I--I'm sorry too.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.824
I shouldn't have been
so defensive.

23:54.868 --> 23:57.871
Just, uh--it was a lot rougher
than I thought it was gonna be.

23:59.176 --> 24:01.701
- You seem better today.
- Yeah.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.833
Yeah, I, uh...

24:03.877 --> 24:05.705
I got a lot of sleep.

24:05.748 --> 24:08.664
Uh, okay, I gotta go to work.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.666
- Um, do you maybe want
to grab some dinner

24:10.710 --> 24:11.798
after work today?

24:11.841 --> 24:13.147
- Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

24:13.190 --> 24:15.889
Uh, just meet me back here
when you're done.

24:15.932 --> 24:16.933
- Yeah.

24:16.977 --> 24:19.196
- Okay.

24:22.243 --> 24:24.767
- I heard.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.203
I'm sorry.

24:26.247 --> 24:28.728
- Yeah, thanks.

24:30.294 --> 24:32.688
- Max wants me
to go "full chemo"

24:32.732 --> 24:34.647
on this reporter.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.300
I don't know
what that means, exactly,

24:36.344 --> 24:37.911
but here are
our few options.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.086
- Okay.

24:39.129 --> 24:41.958
- Step one,
we pull the interview.

24:42.002 --> 24:43.656
If she wants to write about
a ten-year-old arrest,

24:43.699 --> 24:45.048
she can go right ahead,

24:45.092 --> 24:47.877
but she can expect
a defamation suit to follow.

24:47.921 --> 24:49.792
No doubt she indemnified
the publisher

24:49.836 --> 24:51.968
when she was hired,
so when we threaten to sue her

24:52.012 --> 24:53.970
for libel and demand damages

24:54.014 --> 24:55.842
the onus will be on her.

24:55.885 --> 24:59.280
Not on "The New England
Cardiothoracic Journal."

24:59.323 --> 25:01.543
- And that's just step one?

25:01.587 --> 25:05.025
- Do you want to go
"full chemo" or not?

25:05.068 --> 25:07.810
I can make it so this
Penny Atwater can't find a job

25:07.854 --> 25:10.247
at "The New England Journal
of Trout Fishing."

25:10.291 --> 25:12.902
- Damn, you're good.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.861
- It's just so typical.

25:14.904 --> 25:17.298
It's like if you're
African-American

25:17.341 --> 25:19.039
and you're exemplary,

25:19.082 --> 25:22.912
they're always looking
for a catch.

25:22.956 --> 25:25.088
- I just want my nephew...

25:25.132 --> 25:27.264
to know that
you can be exemplary

25:27.308 --> 25:31.181
without a catch, you know?

25:31.225 --> 25:33.793
- As your legal representation,

25:33.836 --> 25:36.317
I can make this all go away.

25:38.798 --> 25:41.104
But as your girlfriend...

25:41.148 --> 25:44.107
I think you should own
your story.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.806
Not in spite of your nephew.

25:46.849 --> 25:49.591
Because of your nephew.

25:49.635 --> 25:52.638
He should know the truth.

25:52.681 --> 25:54.335
All of it.

26:04.737 --> 26:07.043
- Well...

26:07.087 --> 26:09.350
here we are.

26:17.184 --> 26:20.448
It's safe to come
all the way in.

26:37.030 --> 26:38.684
- Well, will you look at that?

26:38.727 --> 26:41.251
- Stove works.
Good to know.

26:43.210 --> 26:46.300
- I haven't made myself
a cup of coffee...

26:46.343 --> 26:47.997
in decades.

26:49.869 --> 26:52.959
- Look, Andy, uh, I know
this place isn't much but--

26:53.002 --> 26:54.917
- No.

26:54.961 --> 26:57.746
It's an awful lot,
Doctor Goodwin.

27:00.270 --> 27:02.751
When do I need
to be out of here?

27:02.795 --> 27:05.885
- No, um,
this isn't temporary.

27:05.928 --> 27:08.975
Andy, this place is yours
as long as you want it.

27:09.018 --> 27:11.325
Just no pets.

27:11.368 --> 27:14.894
Other than that,
you make the rules.

27:14.937 --> 27:17.853
- All of this is mine?

27:21.552 --> 27:24.251
- Welcome home, Andy.

27:47.013 --> 27:48.928
- Floyd?

27:48.971 --> 27:50.930
You wanna begin?

27:54.760 --> 27:56.544
- Yeah.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.463
It was, uh...

28:02.506 --> 28:04.683
It was 2008.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.902
Election night.

28:06.946 --> 28:09.644
And we're having this--
this big party

28:09.688 --> 28:11.559
out in Connecticut

28:11.602 --> 28:14.388
where I was, uh, interning
at a hospital.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.738
And, uh...

28:16.782 --> 28:18.871
it was electric.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.655
I remember I--I never felt

28:20.699 --> 28:23.440
so, uh, empowered, you know?

28:23.484 --> 28:24.964
So present.

28:25.007 --> 28:26.617
So...

28:26.661 --> 28:28.576
American.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.883
I felt invincible and--

28:30.926 --> 28:33.407
and I was on my way home
back to my apartment.

28:33.450 --> 28:35.496
And I remember I rolled
the windows down

28:35.539 --> 28:37.977
so that I could feel
that cool breeze.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.718
And the empty road.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.545
And then...

28:41.589 --> 28:43.634
flashing red lights.

28:43.678 --> 28:44.940
Siren.

28:44.984 --> 28:46.899
I was getting pulled over.

28:46.942 --> 28:48.422
And I checked the speedometer--

28:48.465 --> 28:51.033
only three miles over
the speed limit.

28:51.077 --> 28:53.819
Officer asked me to step out.

28:53.862 --> 28:55.821
Still had on my scrubs.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.736
Showed him my hospital badge

28:57.779 --> 29:00.608
but he didn't like my tone.

29:00.651 --> 29:03.567
And I begged him.

29:03.611 --> 29:05.787
I begged him to just
give me a ticket.

29:05.831 --> 29:06.919
Nope.

29:06.962 --> 29:09.443
There I was,
face-down on my own hood

29:09.486 --> 29:12.576
with my arms cuffed
behind my back

29:12.620 --> 29:15.623
on a night that started out
at my dream internship

29:15.666 --> 29:19.453
celebrating this
newfound hope for America.

29:22.108 --> 29:25.589
Ended with me in a holding cell,
stripped of my dignity...

29:25.633 --> 29:27.896
Waiting for my sister

29:27.940 --> 29:31.465
to catch the next train up
so she could bail me out.

29:33.032 --> 29:35.382
Not even a Morehouse College
license plate

29:35.425 --> 29:37.688
or a Yale Med School
bumper sticker could save me.

29:37.732 --> 29:40.474
No, a mug shot...

29:40.517 --> 29:42.868
that you found...

29:42.911 --> 29:46.306
as a lifelong souvenir.

29:46.349 --> 29:48.787
You know, I was ashamed
of that night for a long time.

29:48.830 --> 29:52.051
That's why I--
that's why I buried it.

29:52.094 --> 29:54.923
You know, that's why I tried
to forget all about it.

29:54.967 --> 29:58.013
I mean, the fact that you
were so eager to shoehorn it

29:58.057 --> 30:00.842
into an article that purports
to celebrate a black doctor,

30:00.886 --> 30:03.497
I mean...

30:03.540 --> 30:06.456
That says very little
about me.

30:10.547 --> 30:13.681
I'm a good surgeon.

30:13.724 --> 30:17.076
Period.

30:17.119 --> 30:19.382
That's your story.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.520
Hey, Beta.

30:26.563 --> 30:27.826
What are you doing here?

30:27.869 --> 30:29.131
- Can't I just stop by
to say hi?

30:29.175 --> 30:31.090
- Any time.
All the time.

30:31.133 --> 30:32.569
Would you like
to go for dinner?

30:32.613 --> 30:33.875
There's a nice
Indian restaurant

30:33.919 --> 30:35.703
down the street.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.705
The food tastes exactly like
your mother's cooking.

30:37.748 --> 30:41.622
- Actually, I have plans
with Ella.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.017
- Ella?

30:45.060 --> 30:47.019
- Turns out we have
the same taste in music.

30:47.062 --> 30:49.543
Weird, right?

30:50.631 --> 30:51.893
- Where are you going?

30:51.937 --> 30:53.112
- We're gonna go see
this band play.

30:53.155 --> 30:54.678
The bassist
is a friend of mine.

30:54.722 --> 30:55.854
We used to jam together a lot.

30:55.897 --> 30:58.160
He was gonna help me
with the demo.

30:59.596 --> 31:00.728
- Okay.

31:00.771 --> 31:02.817
- Anyway...

31:02.861 --> 31:05.167
thanks for introducing us.

31:19.051 --> 31:20.574
- You paged?

31:20.617 --> 31:21.575
- I did.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.142
- What happened?

31:23.185 --> 31:25.971
- Uh, he says he fell off
a ladder and hit his head.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.844
Make that 1.5 million.

31:32.238 --> 31:33.804
- Hey.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.806
Hey, uh, so can we please
go somewhere

31:35.850 --> 31:37.156
not healthy, for once?

31:37.199 --> 31:38.722
I mean, I actually think
I hate salad.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.028
- Uh, Dr. Bloom?

31:40.072 --> 31:41.508
Can I ask you to take
a quick look

31:41.551 --> 31:43.118
at a patient in Bay 4?

31:43.162 --> 31:44.641
- So close.

31:44.685 --> 31:46.078
Okay, um, I'm gonna be
right back.

31:46.121 --> 31:48.907
Uh, your job is to Google
dive bars.

31:48.950 --> 31:51.126
I want a giant,
disgusting burger.

31:51.170 --> 31:53.912
- Eww.

32:31.253 --> 32:33.473
Lauren...

32:35.605 --> 32:37.607
Lauren!

33:09.596 --> 33:11.206
- You're not real.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.600
You're not real.

34:31.373 --> 34:32.940
- Hey, buddy, you need a hand?

34:32.983 --> 34:34.985
- You know what?

34:35.029 --> 34:37.423
That'd be awesome, thanks.

34:43.472 --> 34:45.126
All right, thank--thanks, man.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.562
- You--you should really go
see a doctor, man.

34:46.606 --> 34:48.521
- That's a good idea.

34:59.401 --> 35:01.273
- Max.

35:01.316 --> 35:04.145
Where are you?
- 33rd and Park.

35:04.189 --> 35:05.929
I don't think I can make it.

35:05.973 --> 35:08.236
- Stay there,
I'm coming to you.

35:14.329 --> 35:16.026
- I don't understand.

35:16.070 --> 35:18.507
- Well, it's um--
it's an agricultural co-op.

35:18.551 --> 35:21.162
- It's not a hospital.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.338
- No, it's not.

35:25.166 --> 35:27.473
- What kind of medicine
do they practice there?

35:27.516 --> 35:29.257
- None.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.390
They don't practice
medicine there.

35:31.433 --> 35:34.393
That's the point.

35:34.436 --> 35:36.177
- You're suggesting I--

35:36.221 --> 35:38.179
I send my son away

35:38.223 --> 35:40.399
without me...

35:40.442 --> 35:42.488
to a farm?

35:42.531 --> 35:45.404
To a--a place where
they claim the way to fix him

35:45.447 --> 35:48.842
is to pretend
that he's not sick?

35:48.885 --> 35:50.887
- You know, Hector,
one of the keys

35:50.931 --> 35:53.325
to avoiding relapse
in delusional disorders

35:53.368 --> 35:55.196
is environment.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.589
Plain and simple.

35:56.632 --> 36:00.114
And--and Tony's
current environment...

36:00.158 --> 36:03.030
it's--it's not helping.
You know?

36:03.073 --> 36:06.207
- You mean me?

36:06.251 --> 36:08.078
- And me.

36:08.122 --> 36:10.255
And this hospital.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.216
- That boy is the pride
of my life.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.175
- I know.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.611
- He needs his father.

36:18.654 --> 36:21.266
Someone who will--loves him.

36:21.309 --> 36:23.181
Who will run through walls
for him.

36:23.224 --> 36:25.270
- No, no, no.
Listen, listen, listen.

36:25.313 --> 36:27.533
You're trying to fix him.

36:29.274 --> 36:31.493
We're all trying
to fix him.

36:31.537 --> 36:34.322
And on--on a very deep...

36:34.366 --> 36:38.065
profound level,
Tony feels that.

36:38.108 --> 36:41.329
He knows it,
and it's making him worse.

36:41.373 --> 36:45.028
This place will accept him
as he is.

36:45.072 --> 36:47.161
- You're telling me

36:47.205 --> 36:49.424
to stop trying
to make him better?

36:51.165 --> 36:54.168
- To not be his father?

36:54.212 --> 36:56.518
- You told me...

36:56.562 --> 36:58.999
that to help Tony...

36:59.042 --> 37:02.045
you'd be willing
to risk losing some of him.

37:05.614 --> 37:08.226
This is how you do that.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.548
Andy?

37:28.985 --> 37:31.597
- You gonna take away
my apartment?

37:31.640 --> 37:34.382
- No.

37:34.426 --> 37:37.255
I don't know what to do.

37:38.560 --> 37:41.433
- I--I guess I just
like it here.

37:43.391 --> 37:46.438
- Think we're the only ones.

37:46.481 --> 37:49.702
You are always
welcome here.

37:49.745 --> 37:52.008
When you're sick.

37:52.052 --> 37:53.619
And when you're not sick,

37:53.662 --> 37:57.144
we have a lot of people
that we have to take care of,

37:57.187 --> 38:00.147
and that's just the way
it has to be.

38:00.190 --> 38:01.670
- I'll--I'll leave.

38:01.714 --> 38:03.193
No problem.

38:03.237 --> 38:04.978
- Excuse me?

38:05.021 --> 38:06.762
Sorry, does anyone know
how to get to the ICU?

38:06.806 --> 38:09.199
- Oh, dude, you can't get
to the 12th floor

38:09.243 --> 38:10.679
from this building.

38:10.723 --> 38:13.247
You gotta take the elevator
to the 3rd floor,

38:13.291 --> 38:15.641
then take the breezeway
to Harriman.

38:15.684 --> 38:18.557
Then you take the second set
of elevators to 12.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.167
Then you walk to the end
of the hall.

38:20.210 --> 38:21.168
- Thanks, man.

38:21.211 --> 38:23.562
You're a lifesaver.

38:23.605 --> 38:25.999
- Andy...

38:26.042 --> 38:28.436
- Do you know how to get
to the Oncology Ward?

38:28.480 --> 38:31.439
- Of course, I've had many
the nonexistent tumor

38:31.483 --> 38:33.354
examined there.

38:33.398 --> 38:35.487
- How would you like to start
paying off that apartment?

38:35.530 --> 38:37.663
- How?

38:37.706 --> 38:40.579
- By spending a little more
time at New Amsterdam.

38:43.233 --> 38:44.539
- Hey, champ.

38:44.583 --> 38:49.152
You got time to rap
for a minute?

38:49.196 --> 38:52.373
I got something to tell you.

38:52.417 --> 38:56.203
And I'm hoping you can still
be proud of me.

38:59.598 --> 39:04.080

39:04.124 --> 39:08.346
♪ Our Amsterdam she hides

39:20.488 --> 39:23.056
and just be you.

39:25.188 --> 39:27.103
If you want, Tony.

39:27.147 --> 39:30.542

for one day?

40:18.459 --> 40:20.505
- Think I'm gonna puke.

40:20.548 --> 40:22.376
- We paid enough
for those chairs.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.596
I think that
our Medical Director deserves

40:24.639 --> 40:27.163
to try them out sometime.

40:29.862 --> 40:32.778
- I don't want everyone
to see me so...

40:34.301 --> 40:36.303
Weak.

40:36.346 --> 40:37.522
You know?

40:37.565 --> 40:40.438
It's why I can't
let Georgia come.

40:43.789 --> 40:46.574
Why I can't sit in that chair.

40:47.706 --> 40:50.665
Everybody's gonna see me.

40:56.454 --> 40:59.239
- The answer's yes, Max.

41:00.893 --> 41:04.157
I'll be your deputy.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.811
- But you--
- Go.

41:05.854 --> 41:07.639
Be weak.

41:07.682 --> 41:09.510
Sit.

41:10.816 --> 41:13.514
I won't watch.

41:34.404 --> 41:35.754
- Millie.

41:35.797 --> 41:37.843
Glaciers are moving.
Children are being born.

41:37.886 --> 41:40.454
Can you shuffle any faster?

41:40.498 --> 41:42.891
- I--I think I just went
from a stage three

41:42.935 --> 41:44.240
to a stage four.

41:44.284 --> 41:46.982
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:47.026 --> 41:48.723
- Room for a fourth?

41:48.767 --> 41:50.769
- Yeah, always.

41:50.812 --> 41:52.292
Unfortunately.

41:52.335 --> 41:53.641
- Loving your
slipper game, dude.

41:53.685 --> 41:54.947
- Oh, yeah, thanks.

41:54.990 --> 41:57.210
I'm, uh, feeling pretty good
about it.

41:57.253 --> 42:00.561
Those are, uh,
pretty sharp yourself.

42:01.997 --> 42:05.435
Okay, so, uh, these are mine,
I take it.

42:05.479 --> 42:06.959
Whose are those?

42:07.002 --> 42:08.743
- Those are Stevie's.

42:08.787 --> 42:10.571
Our old fourth.

42:10.615 --> 42:12.791
- We always deal him in.

42:12.834 --> 42:14.575
- Mm.

42:14.619 --> 42:17.447
- You know how
to play euchre, Max?

42:17.491 --> 42:20.668
- Uh, I'll catch on.
