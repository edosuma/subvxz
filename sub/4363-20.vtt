WEBVTT

00:03.474 --> 00:07.038
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS?
MY BOOK. IT'S ALL THERE.

00:07.038 --> 00:09.180
WE NEED SOMEONE
ON THE INSIDE.

00:09.180 --> 00:11.042
(Janis) YOU WANT ME TO BE
A DOUBLE AGENT?

00:11.042 --> 00:13.614
THIS IS WHERE YOU GET
TO PROVE YOUR DEDICATION

00:13.614 --> 00:15.786
TO THE CAUSE, DARLIN'.
WE NEED YOU TO KILL BENFORD.
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

00:15.786 --> 00:17.788
I'M PREGNANT.
MARK, I JUST HOPE THAT YOU KNOW

00:17.788 --> 00:20.251
YOU CAN STILL COUNT ON ME.
I NEVER DOUBTED THAT.

00:20.251 --> 00:22.053
I COULD'VE USED YOU, STAN.

00:22.053 --> 00:24.125
NOW I GOTTA DEAL WITH
VICE PRESIDENT CLEMENTE.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.797
IN MY VISION, IT WAS CLEAR THAT
JERICHO HAD DONE SOME THINGS

00:26.797 --> 00:29.430
THAT THREATENED
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.133
YOU GOT MILITARY CLEARANCE.
AS SOON AS YOU CAN DOCUMENT

00:32.133 --> 00:33.504
WHAT TRACY KNOWS,
I WANT IT UPLOADED.

00:33.504 --> 00:36.137
AS OF THIS MOMENT,
THE WORLD THINKS YOU AND SIMCOE

00:36.137 --> 00:39.039
ACCIDENTALLY CAUSED
THIS BLACKOUT.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.512
WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY
FIND OUT YOU WERE AWAKE

00:41.512 --> 00:44.175
WHILE IT HAPPENED?
(Mark) SIMON CAMPOS
HAS DISAPPEARED.

00:44.175 --> 00:46.447
(Wedeck) HE TOOK THE DAMN RING.
DID YOU OVERHEAR ANYTHING?

00:46.447 --> 00:48.779
THEY SAID HE'S GOING TO CAUSE
ANOTHER BLACKOUT.

00:55.086 --> 00:57.528
ON OCTOBER 6th,

00:57.528 --> 01:00.761
THE PLANET BLACKED OUT
FOR 2 MINUTES AND 17 SECONDS,

01:00.761 --> 01:03.334
AND THE WHOLE WORLD
SAW THE FUTURE.

01:03.334 --> 01:07.568
SOME OF US WERE ALARMED
BY WHAT WE SAW.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.501
OTHERS WERE ELATED
AND REJOICED.

01:10.501 --> 01:12.543
STILL OTHERS SAW NOTHING AT ALL.

01:12.543 --> 01:14.845
THEY WERE LEFT CONFUSED,
CONCERNED

01:14.845 --> 01:16.847
AND OTHERWISE UNCERTAIN.

01:19.079 --> 01:22.453
BUT THAT UNCERTAINTY
WILL SOON BE RESOLVED.

01:22.453 --> 01:27.118
TOMORROW IS D-DAY--THE DAY WE
CATCH UP TO THE FLASH-FORWARDS.

01:27.118 --> 01:31.462
OUR FUTURE BOTH AS INDIVIDUALS
AND AS A COLLECTIVE IS UPON US.

01:31.462 --> 01:35.596
THIS BUILDING MAY VERY WELL COME
UNDER ATTACK TOMORROW NIGHT.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.798
BUT WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN.

01:37.798 --> 01:42.773
WE ARE THE FBI, AND WE WILL
BE OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

01:42.773 --> 01:45.236
THAT SAID,
THE DIRECTOR IS INSTITUTING

01:45.236 --> 01:49.880
HIGH MAXIMUM ALERT PROTOCOLS
AND PROCEDURES.

01:49.880 --> 01:52.243
AGENTS BENFORD AND NOH
WILL BE COORDINATING S.W.A.T.

01:52.243 --> 01:55.816
AND SNIPER TEAMS TO PROVIDE
EXTERNAL SECURITY AND SUPPORT.

01:55.816 --> 01:59.350
VREEDE, HAWK, WILL BE
BRIEFING SUPERVISORS

01:59.350 --> 02:02.193
ON ADDITIONAL O.P.S. PLANS.

02:02.193 --> 02:04.325
WE ARE IN UNCHARTED WATERS,
PEOPLE.

02:04.325 --> 02:07.198
BUT WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS...

02:07.198 --> 02:08.829
TOGETHER. THAT'S ALL.

02:08.829 --> 02:12.663
(indistinct conversations)

02:12.663 --> 02:14.605
MARK.

02:14.605 --> 02:17.338
WALK WITH ME. SIMON CAMPOS?

02:17.338 --> 02:20.140
HIS PHOTO'S OUT TO ALL LOCAL
AND NATIONAL AGENCIES.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.142
HIS CELL PHONE?
SO FAR, INACTIVE.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.815
WHAT ABOUT HIS SISTER? SHE'S
BACK WITH THE FAMILY IN TORONTO.

02:24.815 --> 02:27.147
MAYBE HE'LL TRY
AND CONTACT HER.
R.C.M.P. IS SITTING
ON THE HOUSE.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.250
WE ALSO HAVE A TRAP AND TRACE
ON THEIR PHONES.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.822
HE'S GONE UNDERGROUND AND TAKEN
THAT Q.E.D. RING WITH HIM.

02:31.822 --> 02:35.286
I WANT HIM BACK HERE
IMMEDIATELY.
WE'RE ON IT.

02:35.286 --> 02:38.829
GENTLEMEN, THIS IS TURNING
INTO ONE HELL OF A DAY.
(man) ONCE AGAIN,

02:38.829 --> 02:42.193
WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS
OUT OF LOS ANGELES.
(Wedeck) WHAT IS THIS?

02:42.193 --> 02:44.735
WIKR HAS JUST OBTAINED FOOTAGE
OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE

02:44.735 --> 02:47.938
A MAN WHO WAS AWAKE
DURING THE GLOBAL BLACKOUT.

02:47.938 --> 02:50.441
I GAVE STRICT ORDERS FOR THIS
TO BE KEPT UNDER WRAPS.

02:50.441 --> 02:53.544
WHO RELEASED THIS?
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.
THIS ISN'T US.

02:53.544 --> 02:55.806
AUTHORITIES ARE STILL TRYING
TO IDENTIFY THE MAN, BUT...

02:55.806 --> 02:58.949
IT'S A DIFFERENT ANGLE.
...THE FOOTAGE WAS TAKEN
FROM A SECURITY CAMERA...

02:58.949 --> 03:01.382
(Vogel) HE'S RIGHT.
NO ONE'S SEEN THIS ON OUR END.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.384
WELL,
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

03:03.384 --> 03:06.417
THE BETTER QUESTION IS,
WHY NOW?

03:06.417 --> 03:09.390
WITH APRIL 29th
ONLY ONE DAY AWAY,

03:09.390 --> 03:11.922
THE STUNNED WORLD WONDERS,
WHO IS THIS MAN,

03:11.922 --> 03:14.465
AND WHY WAS HE AWAKE?

03:17.728 --> 03:19.900
(imitating American accent)
HI. MY NAME'S DAVID WALKER.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.873
DAVID WALKER. DAVID WALKER.

03:22.873 --> 03:25.406
DAVID WALKER.
DAVID WALKER.

03:25.406 --> 03:28.239
HI. MY NAME'S DAVID WALKER.

03:28.239 --> 03:31.882
HEY, MY NAME'S DAVE WALKER.
DAVE WALKER.

03:31.882 --> 03:34.245
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?

03:34.245 --> 03:36.216
(normal voice) ALL YOURS.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.723
HEY, HAVEN'T I SEEN YOU
SOMEWHERE BEFORE?

03:42.723 --> 03:45.256
ME? NO. NO.

03:45.256 --> 03:47.858
YOU HAVE SUCH A CUTE FACE,
SIMON.

03:50.861 --> 03:53.003
DON'T HIDE IT.

03:53.003 --> 03:56.337
WHO ARE YOU?
LITA.

03:56.337 --> 03:59.009
AND IF YOU RUN,
THEY WILL FIND YOU.

03:59.009 --> 04:00.811
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

04:00.811 --> 04:03.574
I'M HERE WITH AN OFFER.

04:03.574 --> 04:05.576
AN OFFER? LIKE WHAT,

04:05.576 --> 04:08.419
TAKE MY LAST REMAINING NINE
FINGERS AND KILL MY MOTHER?

04:08.419 --> 04:10.451
YOU'LL WANT TO HEAR US OUT.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.883
SIMON, PLEASE.
I'M DYING OF THIRST.

04:12.883 --> 04:17.688
JUST POUR ME ONE DRINK.
WELL, I SUPPOSE A TASTE
WOULDN'T HURT.

04:17.688 --> 04:19.690
WHAT'LL IT BE?

04:19.690 --> 04:22.363
NOT HERE.

04:40.050 --> 04:43.914
(siren wailing in distance)

04:43.914 --> 04:47.658
YEAH, THIS IS AGENT NOH,
N-O-H, OF THE FBI.

04:47.658 --> 04:49.660
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO THE NEWS DIRECTOR

04:49.660 --> 04:53.524
THAT TOOK POSSESSION OF
THE SUSPECT ZERO FOOTAGE. YEAH.

04:53.524 --> 04:55.696
WELL, SEE IF YOU CAN FIND HIM.
I'LL HOLD.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.897
HEY.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.572
HI. IS SOMETHING WRONG?

05:01.572 --> 05:04.475
NO, NO, NO, NO. I'M JUST, UH,
JUST SURPRISED TO SEE YOU.

05:04.475 --> 05:07.408
WHAT'S GOING ON?
OH, I WAS IN COURT OVER ON
SPRING. I, UM, NEED A FAVOR.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.879
WHAT'S UP?

05:08.879 --> 05:10.941
TAKE TOMORROW OFF.

05:10.941 --> 05:14.845
TOMORROW? NOT A CHANCE.
YOU KNOW WHAT TOMORROW IS.
EXACTLY.

05:14.845 --> 05:17.988
I LOOKED INTO AIRFARE
TO HAWAII--DIRT CHEAP.

05:17.988 --> 05:20.951
APPARENTLY, PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO
FLY ON FLASH-FORWARD DAY, SO...
BABY, LISTEN--

05:20.951 --> 05:23.354
WE--WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

05:23.354 --> 05:25.656
TOMORROW CAN BE
WHATEVER WE WANT IT TO BE.

05:25.656 --> 05:28.759
WE'RE NOT--WE'RE NOT TIED DOWN
TO ANYTHING NOW. LET'S JUST GO.

05:28.759 --> 05:30.761
LISTEN,
WE CAN'T JUST PRETEND

05:30.761 --> 05:32.663
I'M NOT CONNECTED
TO OTHER PEOPLE, ALL RIGHT?

05:32.663 --> 05:34.665
YOU KNOW WHAT'S SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN TO MARK,

05:34.665 --> 05:36.967
AND THERE'S--AND THERE'S JANIS,
AND THERE'S WEDECK--

05:36.967 --> 05:40.511
FOR ONCE, BABY, CAN THIS
JUST BE ABOUT YOU AND ME?

05:45.776 --> 05:47.778
I'M GONNA BE
ON THIS PLANE TOMORROW.

05:47.778 --> 05:50.881
I'M HOPING YOU WILL BE, TOO.
THIS ISN'T FAIR.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.485
(phone beeps)

05:54.485 --> 05:58.028
HANG ON. HI. YEAH.
THIS IS AGENT NOH FROM THE FBI.

05:58.028 --> 06:00.561
YEAH, I NEED TO SPEAK
TO YOUR NEWS DIRECTOR--

06:00.561 --> 06:03.764
WHOEVER TOOK POSSESSION
OF THE SUSPECT ZERO FOOTAGE.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.636
I NEED TO KNOW HOW YOU GOT IT.

06:05.636 --> 06:08.669
I'VE GOT McDOW IN YOUR OFFICE.
OLIVIA IS WITH HIM.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.000
WHY?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.002
THEY GOT SOME KIND
OF CONNECTION.

06:12.002 --> 06:14.875
SHE KEEPS HIM CALM. IF HE KNOWS
ANYTHING ABOUT WHO'S GOING

06:14.875 --> 06:16.907
TO ATTACK THIS OFFICE
TOMORROW NIGHT,

06:16.907 --> 06:18.949
I WANT TO BE THE FIRST
TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

06:18.949 --> 06:21.812
THAT'S--THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
THAT'S IN THE WRONG PLACE.
MM-HMM.

06:21.812 --> 06:24.515
OH, I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
TOUCH THAT, GABRIEL.
NO, BUT THIS ISN'T--
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

06:24.515 --> 06:26.817
I KNOW. I DON'T NEED YOU TO--
DON'T TOUCH IT. DON'T TOUCH IT.
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

06:26.817 --> 06:29.920
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
THAT'S NOT RIGHT. WHO DID THIS?
COULD YOU LEAVE THOSE?

06:29.920 --> 06:32.423
COULD YOU LEAVE THOSE, PLEASE?
WHO DID THIS? IT'S NOT RIGHT.
IT'S NOT RIGHT AS RAIN.

06:32.423 --> 06:34.425
GABRIEL--
SO MANY THINGS
I MISSED BEFORE.

06:34.425 --> 06:37.928
GABRIEL, MY NAME IS MARK.
YEAH, YOU'RE MARK BENFORD.
SHE'S OLIVIA SIMCOE.

06:37.928 --> 06:40.170
I-I'M GONNA MEET
STANFORD WEDECK AND JANIS HAWK

06:40.170 --> 06:42.933
WHEN THEY WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR
IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
GO BACK.

06:42.933 --> 06:45.876
GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD.
NO, GO--GO BACK--

06:45.876 --> 06:48.939
GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD.
IT'S NOT RIGHT, SEE?
NO?

06:48.939 --> 06:51.642
SEE IT? RIGHT TIME, WRONG PLACE.
SEE IT? IT'S NOT RIGHT.

06:51.642 --> 06:54.945
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
CAN I TAKE A LOOK AT THAT?

06:54.945 --> 06:57.488
MM-HMM. IT'S MY BOOK.
YOU BE CAREFUL. IT'S MY BOOK.

06:57.488 --> 06:59.950
IT'S MY BOOK.
GABRIEL, HOW...
HOW DID YOU DRAW THIS?

06:59.950 --> 07:01.592
WITH A PEN.

07:01.592 --> 07:04.424
WITH A PEN.
IT'S WITH A RED PEN,

07:04.424 --> 07:07.427
BECAUSE I LIKE TO USE
THE RED PEN FOR THE LINES--

07:07.427 --> 07:10.060
RED PEN.
GABRIEL WAS GIVEN
MULTIPLE FLASH-FORWARDS,

07:10.060 --> 07:12.202
SO HE MAY HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

07:12.202 --> 07:14.735
I WAS HERE...
WITH DR. FROST.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.067
DYSON FROST?

07:17.067 --> 07:20.440
HE TOLD MY MOTHER
HE'D TAKE CARE OF ME.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.843
HE--HE DIDN'T SAY
IT WOULD BE GOOD CARE.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.516
IT WASN'T. OLIVIA TOOK
GOOD CARE OF ME AT THE HOSPITAL,

07:25.516 --> 07:27.217
AND I GOT SOME NEW SHOES.

07:27.217 --> 07:29.750
DO YOU LIKE MY NEW SHOES?
THEY'RE CUTE.

07:29.750 --> 07:33.684
MM-HMM, AND I HAVE
A HUGE HIPPOCAMPUS, F.Y.I.

07:33.684 --> 07:36.186
THANKS. UH, THANKS
FOR BRINGING HIM IN.

07:36.186 --> 07:38.929
GLAD I COULD HELP.

07:38.929 --> 07:42.462
WE HAVE TO FORMALLY
DEBRIEF HIM, THOUGH.

07:45.496 --> 07:46.997
OKAY. UH, GABRIEL?

07:46.997 --> 07:49.670
MM-HMM?
I'M GONNA GO NOW, SO--

07:49.670 --> 07:52.142
RIGHT. SHOULD I STAY,
OR SHOULD I GO NOW, TOO?
YOU'RE STAYING.

07:52.142 --> 07:55.145
YOU'RE STAYING?
NO. NO. I'M--YOU'RE STAYING.

07:55.145 --> 07:57.247
NO, YOU'RE GONNA STAY.
NO, YOU'RE GONNA STAY.
NO, PLEASE--

07:57.247 --> 08:00.480
OKAY,
CAN YOU LET GO OF MY ARM?
OKAY? NO, YOU'RE STAYING.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.952
CAN YOU LET GO OF MY ARM?
NO, YOU'RE STAYING.

08:01.952 --> 08:04.114
HEY, GABRIEL, LISTEN--
HEY, HEY! YOU CAN'T TOUCH!

08:04.114 --> 08:07.187
(Mark) OKAY. I JUST WON'T...
YOU CAN LOOK, BUT YOU CAN'T--
YOU CAN'T TOUCH.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.920
IT'S OKAY. GABRIEL,
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN'T TOUCH THIS!

08:09.920 --> 08:11.922
(Olivia) MAYBE I SHOULD STAY.
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

08:11.922 --> 08:13.894
OKAY. EVERYTHING'S OKAY.
IT'S ALL OKAY.
IT'S OKAY NOW?

08:13.894 --> 08:17.067
IT'S ALL OKAY NOW. SEE?
IT'S OKAY. YOU WANT A SODA?
YEAH. CAN I HAVE A SODA?

08:17.067 --> 08:18.969
YEAH.
WITH A STRAW?

08:18.969 --> 08:20.901
OKAY. GOOD. HERE WE GO.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.903
(Olivia) OKAY.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.936
(horns honking in distance)

08:25.936 --> 08:32.943
â™ªâ™ª

08:32.943 --> 08:35.586
(door closes)
IT'S OVER. I'M DONE.

08:35.586 --> 08:37.047
PULL ME OUT.

08:37.047 --> 08:40.050
I'VE GONE AS FAR
AS I'M WILLING TO GO.
JUST TAKE A BREATH.

08:40.050 --> 08:42.823
THEY WANT ME TO KILL MARK.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.655
â™ªâ™ª

08:44.655 --> 08:47.297
I TRIED TO STALL
BY GOING TO D.C.,

08:47.297 --> 08:49.930
BUT CARLINE'S BEEN CALLING ME
EVERY SINGLE HOUR.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.903
YOU CAN'T SAY NO.

08:52.903 --> 08:54.905
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

08:54.905 --> 08:56.807
HE'S AN FBI AGENT.

08:56.807 --> 08:58.769
HE'S MY FRIEND.
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

08:58.769 --> 09:00.771
(lowers voice) IF YOU SAY NO,

09:00.771 --> 09:02.813
THEY'LL FIND SOMEONE ELSE
TO KILL HIM,

09:02.813 --> 09:05.215
AND THEN THEY'LL KILL YOU.

09:05.215 --> 09:08.949
THERE IS NO COMING IN FROM
THE COLD HERE, AGENT HAWK.

09:08.949 --> 09:13.283
THE ONLY WAY OUT IS
TO FINISH WHAT WE STARTED.

09:13.283 --> 09:15.285
LOOK AT ME.

09:22.693 --> 09:25.165
WE'RE CLOSE.

09:25.165 --> 09:31.972
FINE.
BUT THEY'RE GETTING ANTSY.

09:31.972 --> 09:35.275
AND THEY'RE GONNA BURN ME IF
I DON'T GIVE THEM SOMETHING BIG.

09:35.275 --> 09:38.809
THEN GIVE THEM SOMETHING BIG.

09:41.011 --> 09:44.114
(door creaks)

09:57.197 --> 10:01.031
I TRIED CALLING YOU LAST NIGHT,
AND THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT.

10:01.031 --> 10:04.735
YEAH, I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
THINGS HAVE BEEN REALLY CRAZY.

10:04.735 --> 10:07.107
LISTEN, I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THIS AT WORK,

10:07.107 --> 10:09.179
BUT, UM,
I THINK WE NEED A PLAN.

10:09.179 --> 10:11.181
DEM, I'M REALLY BUSY.

10:11.181 --> 10:14.114
DO YOU THINK WE CAN TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER?

10:14.114 --> 10:17.217
UM, I WANT TO BE A PART OF
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS BABY.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.220
DEMETRI, I REALLY APPRECIATE
THAT YOU WERE THERE FOR ME

10:20.220 --> 10:22.953
WHEN I NEEDED YOU, BUT YOU
DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING NOW.

10:22.953 --> 10:25.395
SHE'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.
IT'S FINE.
WHAT IF THAT'S
NOT OKAY WITH ME?

10:25.395 --> 10:28.058
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT
TO WALK AWAY?

10:28.058 --> 10:31.301
DEM, YOU HAVE
A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE.

10:31.301 --> 10:34.665
YOU AND ZOEY SHOULD
MAKE THE BEST OF IT.

10:45.315 --> 10:49.950
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing in distance)

10:53.824 --> 10:56.126
I PUT EVERYTHING IN PLACE
FOR THE SECURITY DETAIL

10:56.126 --> 10:58.128
AT THE HOUSE TOMORROW.

10:58.128 --> 10:59.890
OKAY.

10:59.890 --> 11:04.194
I'LL HAVE 'EM LAY LOW
SO AS NOT TO UPSET CHARLIE.

11:04.194 --> 11:07.798
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

11:07.798 --> 11:09.800
I DON'T KNOW, MARK.
IT'S JUST WEIRD.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.972
IT'S WEIRD TO BE TALKING
TO YOU ABOUT SECURITY DETAILS

11:11.972 --> 11:14.004
AND NOT, I DON'T KNOW,
GARAGE DOOR OPENERS

11:14.004 --> 11:16.046
AND PARENT/TEACHER
CONFERENCES.

11:16.046 --> 11:18.849
YEAH. I WISH I HAD SOMETHING TO
SAY THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER.

11:18.849 --> 11:22.082
MM. (grunts)

11:22.082 --> 11:24.785
GOTTA MAKE IT RIGHT, YEAH.
GOTTA MAKE IT RIGHT.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.117
IT'S WRONG.
RIGHT IS RIGHT, YEAH.

11:27.117 --> 11:30.160
THAT'S RIGHT.
HEY, GABRIEL,
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU--

11:30.160 --> 11:32.823
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHAT'S HE DOING IN HERE
BY HIMSELF? WHERE'S VREEDE?

11:32.823 --> 11:36.767
HE WENT TO GET MY BOOK.
IT'S NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
VREEDE!

11:36.767 --> 11:38.398
IT'S NOT RIGHT.
UH, SORRY.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.071
LOOK, I CAN'T JUST HAVE YOU
JUST PULLING THINGS APART...

11:41.071 --> 11:43.433
I'M SORRY, MARK.
LIKE THIS, ALL RIGHT?
THERE YOU GO. OKAY.

11:43.433 --> 11:46.136
MAKE IT LOOK RIGHT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

11:46.136 --> 11:48.939
YOU. YOU MAKE IT LOOK RIGHT.
MAKE...

11:48.939 --> 11:52.983
YOU. YOU MAKE IT LOOK LIKE--
LIKE THIS. LIKE THAT.

12:02.152 --> 12:04.494
(man shouts indistinctly,
camera shutter clicking)

12:04.494 --> 12:09.099
THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE
HOLDING TRACY--JOSHUA BASE.

12:09.099 --> 12:13.463
JERICHO HAS THESE BASES ALL
OVER--NONE OF THEM ON A MAP.
(man shouting indistinctly)

12:13.463 --> 12:17.007
KIDNAP, IMPRISON,
TORTURE WHOEVER THEY WANT.

12:17.007 --> 12:19.039
A SHADOW ARMY.

12:19.039 --> 12:23.373
THAT DOES THINGS YOUR GOVERNMENT
WANTS TO DO BUT LEGALLY CAN'T.

12:23.373 --> 12:25.375
WHO ARE YOU SENDING THOSE TO?

12:25.375 --> 12:30.080
SOMEONE WHO SHARES YOUR BELIEF
THAT JERICHO ARE CRIMINALS.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.053
THERE.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.325
THAT'S WHERE THEY CONDUCT
ALL THE INTERROGATIONS.

12:35.325 --> 12:37.327
TRACY WILL BE IN THERE.

12:37.327 --> 12:40.160
YOU GET THESE UPLOADED,

12:40.160 --> 12:42.993
THEN WE'LL GET
MY DAUGHTER BACK.

12:42.993 --> 12:45.035
(speaking
Middle Eastern language)

12:51.902 --> 12:54.945
(beeping and whirring)

12:57.307 --> 13:00.050
(horns honking in distance)

13:00.050 --> 13:02.352
(man) AUTHORITIES
HAVE IDENTIFIED HIM

13:02.352 --> 13:05.455
AS PHYSICIST SIMON CAMPOS,
THE SAME MAN WHO...
RUN AWAY WITH ME.

13:05.455 --> 13:07.858
ALONG WITH DR. LLOYD SIMCOE
TOOK RESPONSIBILITY...

13:07.858 --> 13:10.020
WHERE WOULD WE GO?

13:10.020 --> 13:12.492
WELL, I WOULD SAY PARIS,
BUT YOU MESSED THAT UP

13:12.492 --> 13:14.895
WHEN YOUR PEOPLE PLASTERED
MY FACE ALL OVER THE NEWS.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.928
DON'T GET SNIPPY WITH ME.
I'M JUST THE MESSENGER.

13:17.928 --> 13:21.071
BESIDES, HELLINGER
WANTS TO HELP YOU.
WHO'S HELLINGER?

13:21.071 --> 13:23.273
HELLINGER'S OUR BOSS.

13:23.273 --> 13:25.936
I DON'T HAVE A BOSS.

13:25.936 --> 13:28.208
EVERYONE HAS A BOSS.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.210
HE PAID FOR YOUR SCHOOL,

13:30.210 --> 13:32.482
GOT YOU A JOB
EQUAL TO YOUR TALENTS,

13:32.482 --> 13:35.015
PROTECTED YOU ALONG THE WAY.
HE'S THE BIG GUY.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.848
PISS OFF.
I'M DONE PAYING MY DEBTS.

13:37.848 --> 13:39.819
HEY, WE'RE NOT THE ENEMY.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.292
IN FACT,
WE'RE YOUR ONLY FRIENDS.

13:42.292 --> 13:44.394
WELL, I HAVE A MESSAGE
FOR YOUR FRIENDS.

13:44.394 --> 13:46.927
I'M DONE DEALING WITH
LOWER LEVEL FUNCTIONARIES.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.029
I THOUGHT I SENT
THAT MESSAGE WITH FLOSSO.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.361
THESE THINGS NEED
TO BE FACE-TO-FACE.

13:51.361 --> 13:54.134
BELIEVE ME,
HE GOT THAT MESSAGE,

13:54.134 --> 13:57.968
AND HE'S ANXIOUS
TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

14:00.110 --> 14:02.612
TRYING TO KEEP YOU
IN ONE PLACE.

14:04.875 --> 14:07.447
(knock on door)

14:10.450 --> 14:12.552
ONE THING YOU SHOULD KNOW...
(door unlocks)

14:12.552 --> 14:14.554
HE'S A VERY CHARMING MAN...

14:14.554 --> 14:17.027
UNTIL HE'S NOT.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.062
MR. CAMPOS.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.995
LET'S SHARE A DRINK,
SHALL WE?

14:27.537 --> 14:30.240
(indistinct conversations)

14:32.142 --> 14:35.005
(Gabriel mumbles)

14:39.079 --> 14:41.151
YEAH, ALL OF THEM.
YEAH, WE WERE--

14:41.151 --> 14:43.914
WE WERE ALL TOGETHER
AT RAVEN RIVER.

14:43.914 --> 14:46.386
AND YOU'RE CERTAIN
ABOUT HER?

14:46.386 --> 14:50.160
NHADRA? NHADRA, YEAH.
NHADRA--NHADRA HAD A NICE SMILE.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.463
HMM. N-NOT IN THIS PICTURE,
BUT NHADRA HAD A NICE SMILE.

14:53.463 --> 14:55.665
AND THIS IS KENT. THIS IS
A TERRIBLE PICTURE OF KENT.

14:55.665 --> 14:58.098
KENT'S MY FRIEND. ALTHOUGH
TECHNICALLY HE'S DEAD,

14:58.098 --> 15:00.900
HE'S--HE'S STILL MY FRIEND.
SO ALL OF THESE PEOPLE
WERE TOGETHER,

15:00.900 --> 15:03.934
AND THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED
BY THE EXPERIMENT?
I THINK WE CAN POSIT THAT

15:03.934 --> 15:06.236
RAVEN RIVER WAS SOME KIND
OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

15:06.236 --> 15:09.439
AND SOMALIA WAS AN ALPHA TEST
FOR THE G.B.O. ON OCTOBER 6th.

15:09.439 --> 15:11.681
OR OCTOBER 6th
WAS THE BETA TEST,

15:11.681 --> 15:13.543
AND THIS IS
JUST THE BEGINNING.

15:13.543 --> 15:18.118
GABRIEL, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHEN THE NEXT ONE WILL BE--

15:18.118 --> 15:21.121
THE NEXT GLOBAL BLACKOUT?

15:21.121 --> 15:23.994
WE NEED YOUR HELP WITH THIS.

15:23.994 --> 15:27.297
IS THERE A SPECIFIC DATE
OR TIME?

15:27.297 --> 15:31.201
DR. FROST WAS IN CHARGE. HE--
HE CHOSE THE TIME AND THE DAY.

15:31.201 --> 15:33.103
NO, I-I JUST WENT
ON MY TRIPS, IS ALL.

15:33.103 --> 15:35.966
I-I JUST WENT ON MY TRIPS,
AND THEN I WROTE DOWN THE NOTES.

15:35.966 --> 15:38.938
DYSON FROST RAN
THE EXPERIMENTS BY HIMSELF?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.240
WAS THERE ANYONE ELSE?

15:40.240 --> 15:42.272
OH... YES.

15:42.272 --> 15:44.714
YEAH, THE BIG GUY.
HE'S THE BOSS.

15:44.714 --> 15:46.346
BIG GUY.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.249
YOU HAVE HIS PICTURE? I DREW
HIS PICTURE. HE'S VERY CLEAN.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.680
DOES BIG GUY HAVE A NAME?

15:50.680 --> 15:53.953
I JUST--I JUST TOLD YOU
HIS NAME. HIS NAME IS BIG GUY.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.725
(Janis)
AND WHERE IS HIS PICTURE?

15:55.725 --> 15:58.728
IN MY BOOK.
THIS ONE?

15:58.728 --> 16:00.530
YEAH. PAGE 15.

16:00.530 --> 16:03.133
IT'S A GOOD PICTURE.
IT'S IN THE BLACK PEN.

16:03.133 --> 16:05.595
YEAH. YEAH. AH.
THAT'S BIG GUY.

16:05.595 --> 16:08.098
YEAH. BIG GUY.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.503
GABRIEL,
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME

16:13.503 --> 16:17.447
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS MAN.
(Demetri)
HEY, SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

16:17.447 --> 16:20.510
MARK, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

16:20.510 --> 16:23.083
(whimpering)
HEY, HEY, HEY. WHAT'S UP?

16:23.083 --> 16:25.115
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT SAFE. IT'S NOT SAFE.

16:25.115 --> 16:28.018
YOU'RE SAFE HERE.
I'M FINE! I'M FINE! HE'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW!

16:28.018 --> 16:29.589
HE DIED! YOU DIED!

16:29.589 --> 16:32.462
VERY SAD THAT DAY, BUT THAT'S--
THAT'S THE WAY IT HAS TO GO

16:32.462 --> 16:36.126
IF THINGS ARE GONNA WORK OUT
RIGHT. YOU DIED THAT DAY.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.036
(glass slides)

16:47.437 --> 16:50.040
CAN YOU IMAGINE
WHAT VILE, DISEASED LIPS

16:50.040 --> 16:51.611
LAST TOUCHED THESE GLASSES...

16:51.611 --> 16:54.013
OR THOSE SHEETS?

16:54.013 --> 16:56.546
I'D HATE TO SEE THEM
UNDER A BLACK LIGHT.

16:56.546 --> 16:59.049
THE LIFE OF SUSPECT ZERO.

16:59.049 --> 17:02.192
YEAH, YOU'D BE SURPRISED
WHAT YOU GET USED TO.

17:02.192 --> 17:04.594
SO...

17:04.594 --> 17:08.058
WE'RE ABOUT A DAY
AWAY FROM THE 29th.

17:08.058 --> 17:10.100
IT'S TIME TO COME HOME,
SIMON.

17:10.100 --> 17:11.701
PISS OFF.

17:11.701 --> 17:14.134
CAN WE GET A LITTLE ICE
IN HERE PLEASE, LITA?

17:16.366 --> 17:18.568
(door opens)

17:18.568 --> 17:20.510
(door closes)

17:20.510 --> 17:23.513
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE ANGRY.

17:23.513 --> 17:26.676
OH, I'M WAY PAST ANGRY,
MATE.

17:26.676 --> 17:28.678
WHERE DO YOU GO
FROM HERE, SIMON?

17:28.678 --> 17:30.620
YOU'RE A FUGITIVE
FROM THE FBI--

17:30.620 --> 17:32.622
THE WHOLE WORLD,
FOR THAT MATTER.

17:32.622 --> 17:35.785
YOUR LIFE'S WORK IS OVER.
YOU HAVE NOTHING.

17:35.785 --> 17:38.458
YOU--YOU ARE NOTHING.
I CAN GIVE IT ALL BACK TO YOU.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.460
COME WORK FOR US.
YOU WILL BE PROTECTED.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.692
YOUR WORK WILL CONTINUE.

17:42.692 --> 17:44.834
AND WE CAN EVEN ARRANGE
FOR YOU TO SEE YOUR FAMILY

17:44.834 --> 17:47.767
FROM TIME TO TIME--
YOUR DEAR ANNABELLE.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.440
THAT'S THE CARROT.
WHAT'S THE STICK?

17:50.440 --> 17:52.402
THE STICK...

17:52.402 --> 17:54.674
IS THE STICK.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.207
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO CONSIDER THAT.

17:57.207 --> 17:59.649
BECAUSE THERE IS NO STICK.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO--

17:59.649 --> 18:03.313
KILL MY FAMILY? CUT ME UP?
HASN'T WORKED SO FAR.

18:03.313 --> 18:05.815
YOU NEED ME,
OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T BE HERE.

18:05.815 --> 18:10.160
AT SOME POINT,
WE WILL CUT OUR LOSSES.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.762
I'M THE ONLY PERSON THAT CAN
CALIBRATE THE ACCELERATOR,

18:12.762 --> 18:15.125
AND YOU KNOW IT.

18:15.125 --> 18:17.127
THIS IS YOUR FINAL OFFER.

18:17.127 --> 18:20.200
I'D SAY SLEEP ON IT,
BUT WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

18:20.200 --> 18:24.134
YEAH. WELL, YOU'LL BE RECEIVING
MY RESPONSE SOON ENOUGH.

18:39.189 --> 18:41.191
(door opens)

18:41.191 --> 18:43.793
(door closes)

18:43.793 --> 18:46.256
MAYBE GABRIEL'S "BIG GUY"
CAN GIVE US A LEAD ON SIMON.

18:46.256 --> 18:48.428
WE'LL RUN THIS THROUGH
FACIAL RECOGNITION ANALYSIS,

18:48.428 --> 18:51.901
GET IT OUT WORLDWIDE.
WE'RE CLOSING IN, DEMETRI.

18:51.901 --> 18:53.903
HEY, YOU WITH ME?

18:53.903 --> 18:56.506
YEAH. I'M SORRY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

18:56.506 --> 18:59.309
DID McDOW
GET UNDER YOUR SKIN?
A LITTLE.

18:59.309 --> 19:02.912
AND THE WHOLE THING
WITH SLINGERLAND TRYING

19:02.912 --> 19:05.245
TO KILL PEOPLE TO COURSE-CORRECT
THE UNIVERSE,

19:05.245 --> 19:07.917
AND DYSON FROST AND HIS
GARDEN OF FORKING PATHS.

19:07.917 --> 19:10.850
NOW THIS GUY.
I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE
HEADED WITH THIS.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.383
(beep)
DON'T GO THERE.

19:13.383 --> 19:15.825
(copier whirs)

19:15.825 --> 19:17.857
YOU BELIEVE
ANY OF THAT STUFF?

19:17.857 --> 19:20.830
(beep)
THAT THE UNIVERSE
IS SOMEHOW PUSHING US

19:20.830 --> 19:22.862
TOWARDS ONE CERTAIN OUTCOME?

19:25.265 --> 19:27.667
NO.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.669
THEN MY BEING ALIVE
ISN'T SOMEHOW...

19:29.669 --> 19:32.572
SCREWING THINGS UP?

19:32.572 --> 19:35.205
OH, I THINK YOU'RE SCREWING
A LOT OF THINGS UP,

19:35.205 --> 19:37.407
BUT THE UNIVERSE HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

19:37.407 --> 19:39.779
THANK YOU. THAT WAS--
THAT WAS REALLY TOUCHING.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.852
HAPPY TO HELP.

19:42.852 --> 19:44.884
YOU KNOW,
AFTER 10:00 TOMORROW NIGHT,

19:44.884 --> 19:48.718
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK
TO LIVING THE WAY WE USED TO.
THANK YOU.

19:48.718 --> 19:51.561
NOT LOOKING AHEAD.

19:51.561 --> 19:55.194
GOTTA SAY, KIND OF LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.866
YEAH.

19:59.829 --> 20:01.971
ME, TOO.

20:06.236 --> 20:08.838
LLOYD. LLOYD.

20:08.838 --> 20:10.910
(chuckles)
(chuckles) LLOYD.

20:10.910 --> 20:15.685
I CAN SEE YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER, GABRIEL.
YEAH, WELL,
I-I HAVE A HUGE HIPPOCAMPUS.

20:15.685 --> 20:17.947
F.Y.I. YEAH, OLIVIA--
OLIVIA--OLIVIA TOLD ME SO.

20:17.947 --> 20:20.450
OLIVIA SAID SO.
WELL, SHE WOULD KNOW.

20:20.450 --> 20:22.452
YEAH.
HOW'S THE DEBRIEFING?

20:22.452 --> 20:25.295
UH, STRESSFUL.
VERY STRESSFUL.
VERY STRESSFUL.

20:25.295 --> 20:28.628
YEAH, I KNOW. I'VE BEEN THERE.
HOW'S IT GOING WITHOUT SIMON?

20:28.628 --> 20:33.002
STRUGGLING WITH
THE DECOHERENCE EQUATION.

20:33.002 --> 20:35.365
YEAH, THE EQUATION.
YEAH, THE EQUA--

20:35.365 --> 20:38.708
THE--THE EQUATION? YEAH, YOU--
YOU DO THE MATH. DO THE MATH.

20:38.708 --> 20:41.671
I DON'T DO MATH. I DO ART.
YOU DO THE MATH. DO THE NUMBERS.

20:41.671 --> 20:44.614
YOU DO THE NUMBERS TOGETHER.
THEY HAVE TO BE

20:44.614 --> 20:47.347
IN THE RIGHT ORDER, THOUGH,
AND THEN YOU'RE BOTH PART

20:47.347 --> 20:49.679
OF THE EQUATION--BOTH OF YOU ARE
PART OF THE EQUATION, YEAH.

20:49.679 --> 20:52.552
THIS CONFIRMS
CLEMENTE'S SUSPICIONS.

20:52.552 --> 20:55.625
THIS ENTIRE OPERATION
IS NOT SUPPOSED TO EXIST.

20:55.625 --> 20:58.388
YOU GOT WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?
I do. You've done
a great job, Aaron.

20:58.388 --> 21:01.861
THEN IT'S TIME TO GET TRACY.
YOU'RE NOT GOING IN THERE.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.533
YES, I AM.

21:03.533 --> 21:05.335
DON'T. PLEASE SIT TIGHT,

21:05.335 --> 21:07.967
at--at least until
I can get the military there

21:07.967 --> 21:10.670
to back you up.
NEGATIVE. MY DAUGHTER
IS NOW THE PRIORITY.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.942
I'VE HELD UP MY END
OF THE DEAL.

21:12.942 --> 21:14.944
I KNOW, AND I APPRECIATE THAT,
AARON,

21:14.944 --> 21:19.008
but I want to keep you safe.
Stay where you are.

21:19.008 --> 21:20.680
I CAN'T.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.952
DAMN IT!

21:22.952 --> 21:25.915
HEY. TRACY.

21:25.915 --> 21:28.688
THEY'RE PUTTING HER
IN THE TRUCK.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.690
LET'S GO.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.862
(speaks Middle Eastern language)

21:34.364 --> 21:37.997
(siren wailing,
horns honking in distance)

21:41.931 --> 21:44.334
I'M RUNNING OUT OF EXCUSES
FOR YOU, DARLIN'.

21:44.334 --> 21:47.807
YOU ASKED ME TO KILL MY FRIEND,
CARLINE, NOT TO BAKE A CAKE.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.309
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO DO ANYTHING.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.982
AND WHEN I TELL YOU SOMETHING
NEEDS TO BE DONE,

21:52.982 --> 21:54.984
YOU NEED TO DO IT.

21:54.984 --> 21:58.488
I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT BENFORD'S AN FBI AGENT.

21:58.488 --> 22:00.950
I CAN'T JUST
WALK INTO THE OFFICE

22:00.950 --> 22:04.694
AND SHOOT HIM IN THE HEAD.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
WHEN?

22:04.694 --> 22:07.557
WHEN I CAN DO IT WITHOUT GETTING
MYSELF KILLED IN THE PROCESS.

22:07.557 --> 22:09.899
WELL, IT BETTER BE
BEFORE TOMORROW NIGHT.

22:09.899 --> 22:13.703
WHY?
OOH. QUESTIONS GET YOU KILLED,
SWEET PEA.

22:13.703 --> 22:15.935
WHERE ARE WE WITH MOSAIC?

22:18.007 --> 22:22.872
OH, DON'T PIDDLE, JANIS.

22:22.872 --> 22:26.776
YOU ARE HANGING ON
BY A THREAD.

22:26.776 --> 22:29.118
IF I GO BACK EMPTY-HANDED,

22:29.118 --> 22:31.381
IT'S OVER FOR YOU.

22:31.381 --> 22:34.824
YOU HAVE A BABY
TO THINK ABOUT.

22:37.086 --> 22:41.060
GABRIEL McDOW.
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

22:41.060 --> 22:43.433
YEAH, I KNOW GABE.

22:43.433 --> 22:46.095
HE'S IN THE FBI RIGHT NOW
LAYING THE WHOLE THING OUT--

22:46.095 --> 22:48.598
RAVEN RIVER, DYSON FROST,
ALL OF IT.

22:48.598 --> 22:50.369
AND THEY'RE BUYIN' IT?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.371
THEY KNOW HE'S A GOLD MINE

22:52.371 --> 22:54.604
AND THAT YOUR PEOPLE
WANT HIM DEAD.

22:54.604 --> 22:59.949
WELL, HE HAS BEEN A BIT OF SAND
IN THE PETROLEUM JELLY.

22:59.949 --> 23:02.412
CAN YOU DELIVER HIM?

23:02.412 --> 23:04.414
HE'S BEING MOVED
TO A SAFE HOUSE.

23:04.414 --> 23:06.115
I CAN TELL YOU
WHEN AND WHERE.

23:06.115 --> 23:09.559
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT YOU.

23:09.559 --> 23:12.492
YOU'RE WORTH THE MONEY,
HONEY.

23:26.035 --> 23:27.977
NEWS DIRECTOR SAYS
THE SUSPECT ZERO FOOTAGE

23:27.977 --> 23:29.939
CAME ON A FLASH DRIVE
DELIVERED BY MESSENGER.

23:29.939 --> 23:31.941
I'VE GOT FORENSICS
ON THE ENVELOPE.

23:31.941 --> 23:34.484
REVIEW THE SURVEILLANCE TAPES
FROM THE CABLE NEWS BUILDING.

23:34.484 --> 23:37.987
I WANT TO TALK
TO THAT MESSENGER.
HEY, MARSHALS HAVE A SAFE HOUSE
AVAILABLE IN SYLMAR.

23:37.987 --> 23:41.951
IT'S OUR BEST OPTION FOR McDOW.
SYLMAR IS OVERUSED.
HOW ABOUT SILVER STRAND BEACH?

23:41.951 --> 23:45.655
D.E.A.'s USING IT.
SYLMAR IT IS. WE'RE ON THE MOVE
WITHIN THE HOUR.

23:45.655 --> 23:48.698
McDOW'S GONNA BLOW A GASKET
IF WE SEPARATE HIM FROM OLIVIA.

23:48.698 --> 23:50.860
I'LL LET YOU BREAK THE NEWS.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.504
THANKS.

23:54.504 --> 23:57.937
(loud bubbling)
(knocks on door)

23:59.509 --> 24:02.842
OLIVIA, COULD I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE?
SURE.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.914
THANK YOU.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, GABRIEL.

24:04.914 --> 24:06.976
I'M GONNA BE RIGHT OUTSIDE,
OKAY?
UM...

24:06.976 --> 24:09.048
RIGHT THERE.

24:13.883 --> 24:16.025
HEY, GABRIEL.

24:16.025 --> 24:19.529
WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU
TO YOUR NEW HOUSE.

24:19.529 --> 24:21.561
YOU'LL LIKE IT THERE.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.994
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE?

24:24.994 --> 24:27.036
LOOSE ENDS.

24:27.036 --> 24:31.040
YEAH. I KNOW THE FEELING.

24:31.040 --> 24:35.004
LISTEN, BEFORE YOU GO,
I NEED TO ASK SOMETHING.

24:37.907 --> 24:41.811
YOU CALLED. YOU SAID...

24:41.811 --> 24:44.754
"OLIVIA...

24:44.754 --> 24:47.186
OLIVIA... SIMCOE."

24:47.186 --> 24:50.990
OLIVIA SIMCOE, YES.
THAT'S RIGHT.

24:50.990 --> 24:54.123
YES.
AND I NEED TO KNOW,
IS THAT HOW THIS ALL TURNS OUT?

24:54.123 --> 24:56.495
IT'S WHAT I'VE SEEN.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.267
I SEE SO--SO MANY THINGS.

24:58.267 --> 25:00.700
SO MANY THINGS
I SEE COME TRUE,

25:00.700 --> 25:03.873
AND I'VE BEEN
WAITING A LONG TIME.

25:03.873 --> 25:06.636
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

25:06.636 --> 25:08.938
WILL SHE BE SAFE?

25:08.938 --> 25:10.940
YES.

25:12.241 --> 25:14.243
YES.

25:18.217 --> 25:22.121
(crickets chirping)

25:22.121 --> 25:23.823
(man) THAT'S FAR ENOUGH.

25:23.823 --> 25:27.627
LET'S PUT HER DOWN OVER THERE
AND START DIGGING.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.605
(gunshot)

25:35.605 --> 25:37.707
(gunshot)
UHH!

25:37.707 --> 25:40.109
NICE SHOT.

25:43.943 --> 25:46.015
(Khamir) DON'T MOVE!
DON'T MOVE!

25:46.015 --> 25:48.848
TRACY! TRACY.
DON'T MOVE! DON'T MOVE!

25:48.848 --> 25:50.920
TRACY, IT'S ME. IT'S DAD.

25:50.920 --> 25:54.153
YOU'RE SAFE NOW, SWEETHEART.
YOU'RE SAFE.
AARON, WE'VE GOT
TO MOVE AND TAKE COVER.

25:54.153 --> 25:57.827
I'LL ASSESS HER INJURIES
OVER THERE. PLEASE.
ALL RIGHT. IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

25:57.827 --> 26:00.059
I GOT YOU. I GOT YOU.
I GOT YOU.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.233
(beeps)

26:08.037 --> 26:11.000
(exhales deeply)

26:14.704 --> 26:17.276
DAISY?

26:17.276 --> 26:19.578
YES, IT'S STAN.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.911
CAN YOU GET
THE PRESIDENT FOR ME?

26:21.911 --> 26:24.213
(beep)
PUT HIM THROUGH.

26:24.213 --> 26:26.055
(beep)

26:26.055 --> 26:29.258
BIG DAY TOMORROW, STAN?
Yes.

26:29.258 --> 26:31.691
YES, IT IS. LISTEN, DAVE...

26:31.691 --> 26:34.163
WHAT'S WRONG?
I'm sitting here
with something--

26:34.163 --> 26:37.096
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T WANT,
AND IT HAS TO DO WITH YOU.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.098
WELL, YOU KNOW
ALL MY SECRETS, STAN.

26:39.098 --> 26:42.031
WE'VE COME ALL THIS WAY.
HOW BAD COULD IT BE?

26:42.031 --> 26:44.603
JOSHUA BASE.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.376
IT DOESN'T RING A BELL.
THEN I HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT

26:47.376 --> 26:49.608
IF I TURN THESE PHOTOS
OVER TO CLEMENTE

26:49.608 --> 26:52.341
for further investigation.
WHY CLEMENTE?

26:52.341 --> 26:54.343
Have you ever asked
your Vice President

26:54.343 --> 26:56.816
WHAT SHE SAW HAPPENING...
TOMORROW?

26:58.848 --> 27:01.390
I ALWAYS KNEW
THIS CALL WAS COMING.

27:01.390 --> 27:05.094
I JUST NEVER FIGURED
IT WOULD COME FROM YOU.

27:05.094 --> 27:08.097
I APPRECIATE THE CALL,
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR WEDECK.

27:08.097 --> 27:09.128
(presses button)

27:09.128 --> 27:13.903
(dial tone)

27:23.843 --> 27:27.116
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
STANFORD WEDECK

27:27.116 --> 27:30.019
FOR VICE PRESIDENT CLEMENTE.

27:30.019 --> 27:32.021
GENTLEMEN,
WE ALL SQUARED AWAY?

27:32.021 --> 27:34.223
READY TO GO.
HOW YOU DOING, GABRIEL?

27:34.223 --> 27:36.225
I'M--I'M BULLETPROOF NOW.

27:36.225 --> 27:39.358
FEELS GOOD, DOESN'T IT?
YEP. YEP.

27:39.358 --> 27:41.060
WHERE'S DEM?

27:41.060 --> 27:43.062
PREPPING THE VAN. LET'S GO.

27:57.947 --> 28:00.249
(cell phone beeps)

28:00.249 --> 28:02.251
McDOW IS ON THE MOVE.

28:02.251 --> 28:05.184
BLACK VAN, TWO AGENTS,
TWO S.W.A.T., HEAVILY ARMED.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.917
118 EAST TO SYLMAR,
EXIT FOOTHILL TOWARDS ARROYO.

28:07.917 --> 28:09.358
20 MINUTES.

28:09.358 --> 28:11.761
(man) Copy that.
We're on our way.

28:11.761 --> 28:13.062
(beep)

28:29.338 --> 28:31.110
(man) IT'S THE DAY
BEFORE THE FLASH-FORWARD,

28:31.110 --> 28:34.013
AND ONCE AGAIN, EVERYONE'S
ASKING, "WHAT DID YOU SEE?"

28:34.013 --> 28:36.846
SO I'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY
WHAT I SAW.

28:36.846 --> 28:39.018
I WAS, AND WILL BE,

28:39.018 --> 28:40.890
ENJOYING ATOMIC WINGS

28:40.890 --> 28:42.892
AT WING A DING DING
OFF TUJUNGA!

28:42.892 --> 28:45.124
TUESDAY NIGHT IS LADIES NIGHT,
WHERE LADIES...

28:45.124 --> 28:47.757
(turns off radio)
JACKASS.

28:47.757 --> 28:49.358
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

28:49.358 --> 28:52.501
(tires screech, horn honks)

28:54.303 --> 28:57.106
THIS GUY DIDN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT USING HIS BLINKER.

28:57.106 --> 29:00.069
LEARN THE RULES, SON!
(honks horn)

29:00.069 --> 29:02.311
(tires peal)

29:02.311 --> 29:04.343
YOU ALL RIGHT BACK THERE?

29:04.343 --> 29:06.445
WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE GOOD.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.993
DEM, CHECK THIS OUT.

29:25.895 --> 29:28.067
GET OUT OF HERE. REVERSE.
REVERSE!

29:28.067 --> 29:31.070
GO! GO, VREEDE!

29:31.070 --> 29:34.874
(tires screeching)

29:52.291 --> 29:55.124
DON'T SHOOT! DON'T SHOOT!
DON'T SHOOT! DON'T SHOOT!
(shouts indistinctly)

29:55.124 --> 29:58.067
DON'T SHOOT! DON'T, DON'T!
DON'T, DON'T, DON'T, DON'T!

29:58.067 --> 29:59.498
ON THE GROUND!
DROP YOUR WEAPON!
ON THE GROUND.

29:59.498 --> 30:04.033
PLAY ALONG. JUST PLAY ALONG.
WE'RE AFTER THE BIG GUY, OKAY?

30:04.033 --> 30:07.977
CALL YOUR BOSS.
TELL HIM YOU HAVE YOUR MAN.
(grunts)

30:07.977 --> 30:09.478
ON THE GROUND!
AAH!

30:09.478 --> 30:12.211
ARE WE CLEAR?
GOT HIM.

30:19.548 --> 30:21.590
(Khamir) MY MEN WILL
INTERROGATE THIS SOLDIER,

30:21.590 --> 30:24.423
WE'LL SEE WHAT HE KNOWS
ABOUT TRACY.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.525
THERE MUST BE A MILITARY
HOSPITAL BACK NEAR KANDAHAR.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.497
NO, THE ROADS
ARE TOO DANGEROUS.

30:28.497 --> 30:31.030
THEY'LL FLAG US
AT THE CHECKPOINTS.
SCREW THE CHECKPOINTS.

30:31.030 --> 30:34.133
EVEN IF WE MANAGE TO GET THERE
WITHOUT GETTING KILLED,

30:34.133 --> 30:37.066
I DON'T THINK
SHE'LL SURVIVE THE RIDE.
HOLD ON, HONEY. I GOT YOU.

30:37.066 --> 30:39.208
(Tracy) DADDY.
AARON, WE CAN'T GO BACK NOW.

30:39.208 --> 30:41.540
YOU LISTEN TO ME, BUDDY.
WE ARE GONNA DRIVE BACK

30:41.540 --> 30:44.373
TO KANDAHAR, AND YOU'RE
GONNA SAVE HER LIFE.
AARON--

30:44.373 --> 30:46.375
I SAW HER ALIVE.
SHE'S GONNA MAKE IT.

30:46.375 --> 30:49.278
WE ALL ARE. NOW DRIVE.

30:49.278 --> 30:52.851
HOLD ON, SWEETHEART.
I GOT YOU.
(engine starts)

30:52.851 --> 30:55.925
WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.

30:55.925 --> 30:58.057
I GOT YOU. DRIVE.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.971
MR. HELLINGER SAID
RIGHT OVER THERE.

31:24.053 --> 31:25.985
GABRIEL McDOW.

31:25.985 --> 31:29.158
WELCOME BACK INTO THE FOLD.

31:35.124 --> 31:36.195
IT'S A TRAP!

31:36.195 --> 31:39.068
DON'T!
(Hellinger) RED! RED!

31:39.068 --> 31:41.300
RED, RED, RED!
(shouting indistinctly)

31:41.300 --> 31:43.272
(Hellinger) BURN IT ALL!

31:45.304 --> 31:48.107
(indistinct shouting continues)

31:50.179 --> 31:54.613
GET DOWN! MOVE! MOVE!

31:54.613 --> 31:57.146
HELLINGER, FREEZE!

31:59.448 --> 32:00.919
(rapid beeping)

32:00.919 --> 32:04.053
(Mark) DOWN ON THE GROUND!
FACE DOWN!

32:04.053 --> 32:07.396
DON'T MOVE!
(alarm wailing)

32:07.396 --> 32:09.598
GAME OVER, HELLINGER.
START TALKING.

32:09.598 --> 32:10.629
(whirs)

32:13.162 --> 32:17.636
SIMON CAMPOS--DOES HE
WORK FOR YOU? IS HE HERE?

32:17.636 --> 32:19.708
TELL ME WHERE HE IS!

32:52.101 --> 32:55.074
(car alarm chirps)

32:55.074 --> 32:57.146
(Janis) DAMN IT, MARK!

32:59.978 --> 33:02.711
YOU SCARED ME.

33:02.711 --> 33:06.385
WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?
WHAT?

33:06.385 --> 33:09.088
YOU'RE NOT FBI. SO WHO THE HELL
SIGNS YOUR PAYCHECKS?

33:14.093 --> 33:16.725
CIA.

33:20.269 --> 33:22.171
HOW LONG?

33:22.171 --> 33:25.204
VOGEL RECRUITED ME
AT QUANTICO.

33:25.204 --> 33:28.107
THREE YEARS.

33:28.107 --> 33:32.181
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
I GOT SUSPICIOUS WHEN YOU
SOLD OUT MARCIE AS THE MOLE.

33:32.181 --> 33:34.713
MARCIE HAS A BROTHER.
HE'S DYING IN MISSOURI

33:34.713 --> 33:38.487
IN A FULL-CARE FACILITY.
IT'S EXPENSIVE.

33:38.487 --> 33:40.719
THE MEETINGS WITH VOGEL,
THE FISH STORE...

33:40.719 --> 33:43.652
(door bells jingle)
WHERE I ASSUME YOU WERE
MEETING YOUR CONTACT.

33:43.652 --> 33:46.495
BUT IT WAS THE HELLINGER STING,
CONFIRMED EVERYTHING.

33:46.495 --> 33:50.359
YOUR ASSIGNMENT TODAY GOES
BEYOND BEING McDOW'S DECOY.

33:50.359 --> 33:52.231
HOW FAR BEYOND?

33:52.231 --> 33:54.663
INTEL SAYS THEY'RE
PLANNING TO KIDNAP McDOW

33:54.663 --> 33:58.807
EN ROUTE TO THE SAFE HOUSE,
SO...
IT'S OUT BEST CHANCE TO CAPTURE
SOMEONE OF VALUE.

33:58.807 --> 34:01.039
BASED ON WHAT INTEL,
JANIS?

34:01.039 --> 34:03.242
THERE'S A LOT OF CHATTER.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.544
"THERE'S A LOT OF CHATTER"?
THERE IS NO CHATTER.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.546
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO LISTEN.

34:07.546 --> 34:11.180
WHO'S YOUR SOURCE?
MY SOURCE IS RELIABLE.

34:15.384 --> 34:17.826
YOU BLEW YOUR COVER
BY SETTING HIM UP.

34:17.826 --> 34:21.560
WHY NOW?

34:21.560 --> 34:24.463
BECAUSE THEY WANTED ME
TO KILL YOU, MARK.

34:27.436 --> 34:29.598
I TOLD THEM I WOULD.

34:29.598 --> 34:32.441
A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE GONNA BE WONDERING

34:32.441 --> 34:34.443
WHO THE HELL YOU REALLY ARE.

34:34.443 --> 34:36.605
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

34:36.605 --> 34:38.577
"SACRIFICE
FOR THE GREATER GOOD."

34:38.577 --> 34:40.749
I'VE TRIED THAT LINE.
IT DOESN'T WORK.

34:40.749 --> 34:42.781
LOOKS GOOD ON A PLAQUE,
THOUGH.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.783
DON'T SAY THAT TO ME, MARK.

34:44.783 --> 34:48.517
I'VE BEEN LIVING IN BETWEEN
TWO SEPARATE LIVES

34:48.517 --> 34:53.222
IN THIS TINY SPACE
WHERE NOTHING EVER HAPPENS.

34:53.222 --> 34:57.396
I CAN'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

34:57.396 --> 35:01.130
I CAN'T FALL IN LOVE.
NOBODY EVEN KNOWS ME.

35:06.675 --> 35:09.178
I WAS DOING MY JOB.

35:09.178 --> 35:12.781
THAT HAS TO COUNT
FOR SOMETHING.

35:12.781 --> 35:14.783
IT DOES.

35:14.783 --> 35:18.717
TOO BAD ALL ANYONE WILL
EVER SEE IS THE DECEPTION,

35:18.717 --> 35:22.351
AND THEY WILL NEVER
GET PAST IT.

35:22.351 --> 35:25.524
YOU'RE ON THE OUTSIDE NOW,
JANIS.

35:25.524 --> 35:29.528
IF YOU SACRIFICE EVERYTHING,

35:29.528 --> 35:32.431
BE PREPARED TO WALK ALONE.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.533
YOU'RE WALKING
RIGHT BESIDE ME.

35:36.605 --> 35:40.839
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO LOSE YOUR FAMILY.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.841
IS IT WORTH IT TO YOU?

35:42.841 --> 35:45.444
I DON'T ASK THAT QUESTION.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.546
HOW CAN YOU NOT?

35:47.546 --> 35:50.148
TOO MUCH AT STAKE.

35:52.221 --> 35:54.453
MARK.

35:54.453 --> 35:58.657
PLEASE DON'T TELL DEMETRI.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.159
JUST LET ME DO IT.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.844
IT'S ALL OVER. I'M GLAD TO BE
OUT FROM UNDER ALL THAT LYING.

36:15.844 --> 36:18.176
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU COULD DO THIS.

36:18.176 --> 36:22.211
I THOUGHT I COULD GET AWAY CLEAN
AND NOT HURT ANYBODY.

36:22.211 --> 36:25.183
WHAT ABOUT THE PREGNANCY?

36:25.183 --> 36:27.786
HOW DOES THAT NOT
INVOLVE ME?

36:27.786 --> 36:30.959
DEMETRI, I JUST...
I NEEDED A WAY OUT.

36:30.959 --> 36:35.264
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
A NEW BEGINNING. I'M SORRY.

36:35.264 --> 36:38.267
YOU'RE MY FRIEND, AND I SHOULD
HAVE DONE BETTER BY YOU.

36:38.267 --> 36:40.269
BUT THIS BABY IS
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

36:40.269 --> 36:41.300
THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

36:41.300 --> 36:44.233
IT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN TO YOU.

36:44.233 --> 36:47.876
EVERY LITTLE DECISION YOU MAKE
LEADS TO SOMETHING ELSE,

36:47.876 --> 36:50.879
AND NOW WE'RE ALL CONNECTED--
YOU AND ME AND ZOEY.

36:50.879 --> 36:53.782
NO, WE'RE NOT.

36:53.782 --> 36:57.386
DEMETRI, THERE'S ME AND MY BABY,
AND THEN THERE'S YOU AND ZOEY.

36:57.386 --> 36:59.888
DON'T LET THIS SITUATION
RUIN YOUR LIFE.

36:59.888 --> 37:03.492
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE PART
OF THE MESS THAT I MADE.

37:03.492 --> 37:06.755
YEAH, WELL...

37:06.755 --> 37:09.227
I ALREADY AM.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.639
(man) MEANWHILE,
IN THE READY ROOM

37:20.639 --> 37:23.542
OF THE AMERICAN EAGLE SQUADRON,
YANK, DOODLE AND DEEWATCH

37:23.542 --> 37:25.874
WHILE DAN TRIES
TO CONTACT ROGER RAMJET.

37:25.874 --> 37:28.847
(Dee) ROGER SHOULD HAVE LOCATED
THE NO-GOODS' HIDEOUT BY NOW.

37:28.847 --> 37:32.981
(Yank) THEN WHY CAN'T
WE REACH HIM...
HEY, GABRIEL.

37:32.981 --> 37:35.884
AGENT NOH.

37:35.884 --> 37:37.286
YEAH, I KNOW.

37:37.286 --> 37:38.927
MIND IF I SIT?

37:38.927 --> 37:40.989
TAKE A SEAT.

37:40.989 --> 37:43.031
SURE. TAKE A SEAT.

37:43.031 --> 37:44.993
ROGER RAMJET?
YEAH, IT'S DR. EVILKISSER.

37:44.993 --> 37:48.437
I LOVE THIS SHOW.
YEAH, ME, TOO. DR. EVILKISSER.

37:48.437 --> 37:49.938
EVILKISSER, YEAH.

37:49.938 --> 37:52.641
(laughing)
YEAH.

37:52.641 --> 37:55.444
(laughs)
CHIEF OF THE ARMY'S
COUNTER-BAD-GUY DIVISION...

37:55.444 --> 37:57.446
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

37:57.446 --> 37:59.948
YEAH. YEAH, SURE.

38:02.010 --> 38:04.583
IN ALL THE FUTURES YOU SAW,

38:04.583 --> 38:07.556
WAS I IN ANY OF THEM?

38:07.556 --> 38:08.657
NO, YOU DIED.

38:08.657 --> 38:10.989
PEOPLE--PEOPLE WERE SAD.

38:10.989 --> 38:13.322
VERY SAD. (crunching)

38:13.322 --> 38:18.867
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS WHEN
THE FUTURE YOU SAW CHANGES?

38:18.867 --> 38:22.931
YEAH, Y-YOU KNOW,
THAT--THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

38:22.931 --> 38:26.435
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE. IT'S LIKE
TRYING TO FIND A DIFFERENT PATH.

38:26.435 --> 38:28.577
YOU WIND UP
IN THE SAME PLACE ALWAYS--

38:28.577 --> 38:30.739
ALWAYS IN THE SAME PLACE--
LIKE FATE. FATE.

38:30.739 --> 38:32.741
LIKE LLOYD AND OLIVIA.
E-EVERYONE IS ENDING UP

38:32.741 --> 38:35.914
WHERE--WHERE THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.946
EVEN YOU.

38:40.018 --> 38:41.750
MAKES SENSE.

38:41.750 --> 38:44.993
YEAH.

38:44.993 --> 38:48.427
NOW WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

38:48.427 --> 38:52.000
I PLAN TO FIND THAT DIABOLICAL
MACHINE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
THEN HURRY.

39:00.068 --> 39:03.472
(man speaks
Middle Eastern language)

39:03.472 --> 39:08.076
WAIT HERE. WAIT HERE.
(speaks Middle Eastern language)

39:08.076 --> 39:10.879
(whoosh)

39:10.879 --> 39:13.582
OH, MY GOD.

39:13.582 --> 39:15.484
(speaks Middle Eastern language)

39:15.484 --> 39:18.787
THIS IS IT. WE'RE HERE.

39:18.787 --> 39:20.759
(whoosh)

39:20.759 --> 39:23.131
I'LL ALWAYS FIND YOU, KIDDO.
(whoosh)

39:23.131 --> 39:25.894
IT'S OKAY.
OKAY.

39:25.894 --> 39:27.766
WE MADE IT.

39:42.911 --> 39:43.982
NO.

39:43.982 --> 39:48.016
JANIS, RELAX. RELAX.

39:50.519 --> 39:53.592
I NEED YOUR HELP.
