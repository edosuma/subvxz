WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:03.771
* *

00:05.039 --> 00:06.907
* Whoo *

00:06.974 --> 00:08.942
* Here we go *

00:09.009 --> 00:10.511
* Oh, oh, oh *

00:10.578 --> 00:11.512
* Daddy-O *

00:11.579 --> 00:13.081
* Oh oh oh *

00:13.147 --> 00:14.215
* Birth control *

00:14.282 --> 00:16.084
* No no no *

00:16.150 --> 00:17.585
* Let it roll *
(Hope giggles)

00:17.651 --> 00:19.520
* Oh oh oh *

00:19.587 --> 00:21.822
* Whoa *

00:21.889 --> 00:22.923
* Whoa *

00:22.990 --> 00:25.059
* Whoo *

00:25.126 --> 00:26.760
* Here we go *

00:26.827 --> 00:28.129
* Oh oh oh *

00:28.196 --> 00:31.365
* Oh oh oh *

00:31.432 --> 00:33.567
(over record player):
* Istanbul was Constantinople *

00:33.634 --> 00:36.604
* Now it's Istanbul,
not Constantinople *

00:36.670 --> 00:39.540
* Been a long time gone,
old Constantinople *

00:39.607 --> 00:42.876
* Still, it's Turkish delight
on a moonlit night *

00:42.943 --> 00:45.479
* Every gal in Constantinople *

00:45.546 --> 00:46.614
* Lives in Istanbul,
not Constantinople...*

00:46.680 --> 00:48.916
(door opens)
Hey, how was work?

00:48.982 --> 00:50.050
Great.

00:50.118 --> 00:52.353
The Giddlemans are remodeling,
so they put

00:52.420 --> 00:55.323
all their old stuff out on the
curb for the help to fight over.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.159
Almost got my hands
on a combination TV/VCR,

00:58.226 --> 01:00.561
but their exterminator
blasted me with ant spray.

01:00.628 --> 01:01.595
Mm.

01:01.662 --> 01:04.098
I thought you tasted
kind of poison-y.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.499
Have you seen this?

01:05.566 --> 01:08.436
As long as I have this song
playing, she can't lose.

01:10.471 --> 01:11.805
I know.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.875
It's weird how music kicks in
certain things in her brain.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.344
The other day, I found out

01:16.410 --> 01:18.779
"America the Beautiful"
makes her poop faster.

01:18.846 --> 01:19.747
JIMMY:
Hey, guys,

01:19.813 --> 01:20.781
check it out.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.283
I taught Hope a trick.

01:30.658 --> 01:31.592
She's crawling.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.296
I taught her how to crawl.

01:35.363 --> 01:36.964
VIRGINIA:
Are you kidding me?

01:37.030 --> 01:38.399
We're all exhausted

01:38.466 --> 01:40.168
taking care of
that baby as it is.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.702
You taught
it to move?

01:41.769 --> 01:43.003
Good Lord.

01:43.070 --> 01:45.506
Hope she doesn't get into
things the way you used to.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.875
* Take me back
to Constantinople *

01:47.941 --> 01:51.545
* No, you can't go back
to Constantinople *

01:51.612 --> 01:54.315
* Now it's Istanbul,
not Constantinople *

01:54.382 --> 01:56.817
* Why did Constantinople
get the works? *

01:56.884 --> 01:59.853
* That's nobody's business
but the Turks *

02:09.697 --> 02:12.466
* Istanbul *

02:12.533 --> 02:14.268
We're gonna have to do

02:14.335 --> 02:16.170
some serious baby-proofing
around here.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.538
VIRGINIA:
Ugh, God!

02:17.605 --> 02:19.139
Don't tell me you're
going to turn this house

02:19.207 --> 02:21.609
into one of those baby-
proofing nightmares.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.377
I was cleaning a place the
other day, and they even had

02:23.444 --> 02:25.145
a lock on the damn toilet.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.447
* Not Constantinople *

02:26.514 --> 02:29.917
* Why did Constantinople
get the works? *

02:29.983 --> 02:34.388
* That's nobody's business
but the Turks *

02:34.455 --> 02:39.360
* Istanbul... *

02:39.427 --> 02:41.762
I'm in here!

02:41.829 --> 02:45.199
Jimmy, you can't protect your
child from every little danger.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.301
They have to learn
from their own mistakes.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.237
Yeah, like how I learned
to jump off the roof

02:49.303 --> 02:50.371
with an umbrella?

02:50.438 --> 02:52.273
Once, and then
you never did it again.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.241
Plus, you learned about gravity.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.808
What I learned

02:54.875 --> 02:57.545
was I need to protect my child
better than you protected me.

02:57.611 --> 02:58.612
For the record,
I thought

02:58.679 --> 03:00.448
that umbrella thing
was going to work.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.384
Wind was really humming
that day.

03:03.451 --> 03:04.652
You're going to have

03:04.718 --> 03:06.119
to move all these
pool chemicals out of here.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.588
She can get to this now.

03:07.655 --> 03:08.722
I don't have anywhere
else to put them.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.459
Back of the truck is
all full of weed killer.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.593
I could put
the weed killer in here

03:12.660 --> 03:14.962
if you think
that's better.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.197
"Pick your poison."

03:17.265 --> 03:18.932
I just got that.

03:18.999 --> 03:19.933
(laughs)

03:20.000 --> 03:20.934
Ow.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.536
(grunts)

03:22.603 --> 03:26.307
Maybe I'll see if Mom can make
some room in the greenhouse.

03:28.342 --> 03:29.277
There are some things
I don't like

03:29.343 --> 03:30.978
to talk
to your grandma about.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.212
One is her hobby.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.482
You see, some grandmas bake,

03:34.548 --> 03:37.017
some play bridge,
some crochet.

03:37.084 --> 03:39.987
Your grandma is a hoarder.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.057
One of the only perks
of cleaning houses

03:44.124 --> 03:46.994
is getting all the crap
the rich people no longer want.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.596
( grunting )

03:48.662 --> 03:50.030
It never bothered
your grandmother

03:50.097 --> 03:52.065
that she didn't have a use
for any of the stuff.

03:52.132 --> 03:55.303
All she knew was:
it was free and she wanted it.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.770
What are you guys doing
in my stuff?

03:56.837 --> 03:58.038
You didn't touch my stuff,
did you?

03:58.105 --> 03:59.039
Don't touch my stuff.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.173
This is my stuff.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.675
Mom, I need to
make a little room

04:01.742 --> 04:03.544
in here
for Dad's pool chemicals.

04:03.611 --> 04:07.080
Can we maybe pick a few items
that you might not need?

04:07.147 --> 04:09.082
I need everything
in here.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.083
Do you need
this box

04:10.150 --> 04:11.251
of towel racks?

04:11.319 --> 04:13.053
Because not only
have I never seen

04:13.120 --> 04:14.322
anyone in this house
hang up a towel,

04:14.388 --> 04:16.690
we only have one bathroom.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.626
We do now, but we don't know

04:18.692 --> 04:20.260
how many bathrooms we're going
to have when your father

04:20.328 --> 04:22.062
and I get our own place.
Do you think

04:22.129 --> 04:23.431
you're going to have 20?

04:23.497 --> 04:24.498
BURT:
We might.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.499
I've been getting really close

04:25.566 --> 04:26.634
with the lottery lately.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.935
Two weeks ago,
I got one number.

04:28.001 --> 04:28.936
Last week

04:29.002 --> 04:30.504
I almost got two.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.373
I think she's getting ready
to bust wide open.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.374
What's tonight's jackpot up to?

04:33.441 --> 04:35.476
46 million.
Nice.

04:35.543 --> 04:36.910
I'm glad we didn't win
last week.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.278
Now we can get a
house and a boat.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.080
Oh, I've been thinking
about boat names.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.616
How about Ship Happens?

04:43.917 --> 04:46.019
The Love Burt?

04:46.086 --> 04:47.287
Aquaholic?

04:48.356 --> 04:49.823
Yeah, Buoy?

04:49.890 --> 04:51.392
I'll keep thinking.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.794
How about you keep thinking
about where to put
the pool chemicals?

04:53.861 --> 04:55.429
I'm going to get some
baby-proofing stuff.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.997
See if the hardware store
has sheds on sale.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.032
I'm not going
to the hardware store.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.300
Going to the grocery store.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.102
I think Sabrina's
working tonight.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.704
There you go.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.806
Just 'cause she has
a boyfriend, don't give up.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.541
Girls are just
like the lottery.

05:07.608 --> 05:08.776
You can't win
if you don't play.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.412
Make sure you smile a lot;
you got a great smile.

05:13.781 --> 05:14.915
Okay, maybe I was thinking
of somebody else.

05:14.982 --> 05:15.916
Go.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.392
* *

05:27.628 --> 05:29.296
Howdy-hi, partner.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.564
Howdy-hi.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.165
No, you don't
have to do it,

05:32.232 --> 05:33.534
just us.
Oh.

05:33.601 --> 05:34.668
(chuckles nervously)

05:36.537 --> 05:38.238
What were you writing
in that notebook?

05:38.305 --> 05:40.541
Oh, I'm working
on a short story.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.776
I'm taking a creative
writing class.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.546
Cool, um,
what's the story about?

05:45.613 --> 05:47.715
It's called The
Elephant in the Room.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.182
It's about a Waspy family

05:49.249 --> 05:51.385
that's slowly turning
into emotionless zombies.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.120
Whoo, spooky.
(chuckles)

05:53.186 --> 05:56.156
Yeah, yeah, I'm having
a lot of fun writing it.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.025
I'm kind of stuck on
this one sentence.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.894
Like, what's another
word for "ostentatious"?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.736
Uh...

06:09.903 --> 06:11.739
Delicious?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.875
Tired?

06:14.942 --> 06:17.110
Obnoxious?

06:17.177 --> 06:18.178
Lamp shade?

06:18.245 --> 06:20.280
I really don't know that word.

06:20.347 --> 06:21.248
Yeah, no, keep
going, though.

06:21.314 --> 06:22.249
This is fun.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.283
Chocoholic?

06:23.350 --> 06:24.785
(laughs)

06:24.852 --> 06:26.654
MAN (on TV): And here
are tonight's lottery...

06:26.720 --> 06:30.190
VIRGINIA:
* O beautiful
for spacious skies... *

06:30.257 --> 06:31.759
Come on, Maw Maw.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.528
* For amber waves of grain... *

06:34.595 --> 06:35.929
There you go, sweetheart.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.899
* For purple mountain
majesties... *

06:38.966 --> 06:39.767
(Burt groans)

06:39.833 --> 06:43.437
* Above the fruited plain. *

06:43.504 --> 06:44.472
(toilet flushes)

06:44.538 --> 06:46.440
You go get in the bathtub.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.742
I'll come check on you
in a bit.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.177
Whoa.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.813
I got to start videotaping
what goes on in that bathroom.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.247
Be good to have in
case my cousin tries

06:54.314 --> 06:58.051
to fight us in court for
the house after Maw Maw dies.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.426
Where's Hope?

07:06.494 --> 07:10.030
Uh, she was here
a second ago.

07:21.008 --> 07:24.111
He just had to teach her
to crawl, didn't he?

07:24.177 --> 07:27.114
Here, baby,
baby, baby.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.682
Here, baby, baby, baby.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.150
Why the hell are
you looking up?

07:30.217 --> 07:31.184
You were looking down.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.185
I thought you had
that covered.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.821
What, do you think
she'd climb a tree?

07:33.887 --> 07:35.989
No, a hawk
might have got her.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.991
Oh, God, I never
thought of that.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.627
Hope!

07:39.693 --> 07:42.696
(Hope crying)

07:48.268 --> 07:50.671
(cooing)

07:50.738 --> 07:52.205
(Virginia groans)

07:52.272 --> 07:55.108
You just know he's going to find
a way to blame us for this.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.082
(giggling)

08:05.853 --> 08:08.155
Quick, help me get
this stuff out of here.

08:08.221 --> 08:11.191
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.993
(giggling)

08:13.060 --> 08:14.127
Not a good idea.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.329
This is bad.

08:16.396 --> 08:17.965
This is really bad.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.400
I'm freaking out a
little bit here, Burt.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.402
I'm not doing
well with this.

08:22.469 --> 08:23.604
Think of something.

08:23.671 --> 08:24.972
How are we going to
fix this-- think.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.974
You know I can't think
on demand like that.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.275
Think.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.276
Stop-stop saying
"Think."

08:29.342 --> 08:30.343
Every time
you say "Think,"

08:30.410 --> 08:31.579
all I can think is
the word "think,"

08:31.645 --> 08:33.614
and it fills up
my whole brain.
All right,
all right.

08:33.681 --> 08:34.915
Think, think, think.
All right.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.316
It keeps changing
colors and sizes.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.450
I-I can't get
past it.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.886
All right,
(sighs)

08:38.952 --> 08:40.588
I'm getting
kind of antsy.

08:40.654 --> 08:41.789
I need to clear my head.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.024
Relax me-- do,
do my thing.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.729
(sighing)

08:50.664 --> 08:52.933
All right.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.902
Here we go.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.072
If we can't get to the baby,

08:59.139 --> 09:02.876
we need to get it
to come out on its own.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.883
You're still just thinking of
the word "think," aren't you?

09:09.950 --> 09:12.820
Yeah, a little guy with
a hand pump just came out,

09:12.886 --> 09:14.521
pumped up the word
until it exploded

09:14.588 --> 09:17.625
into a million
little thinks.

09:17.691 --> 09:20.894
Hmm, just keep stroking my nose.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.964
(gasps)

09:24.031 --> 09:26.433
Sugar cubes.

09:26.499 --> 09:27.835
You good?

09:37.878 --> 09:40.047
JIMMY: What are you
looking for?

09:40.113 --> 09:41.649
Sugar cubes.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.952
I was going to teach Hope
how to somersault.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.087
Are we out? If we're out,
I can go back to the store.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.521
It's no problem.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.758
Get right back there
while she's still working.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.661
Yes, we're out.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.228
VIRGINIA: Jimmy came home,

09:55.295 --> 09:57.330
but I sent him
back to the store.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.331
How is she?

09:58.398 --> 09:59.399
She's cool.

09:59.466 --> 10:02.069
I'm keeping her
entertained.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.305
VIRGINIA:
Hey, sweetie,
look what I got.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.573
If you want

10:06.640 --> 10:07.675
your sugar cubes,
you got to come

10:07.741 --> 10:09.409
to the front of
the greenhouse,

10:09.476 --> 10:12.312
but you can't crawl along the
side here 'cause it's blocked,

10:12.379 --> 10:15.448
so you want to go
back about two feet,

10:15.515 --> 10:17.484
make a left at
the fax machine,

10:17.550 --> 10:19.252
crawl over the
big aquarium

10:19.319 --> 10:21.588
and then under the
little aquarium,

10:21.655 --> 10:24.658
and keep on going
till you're old enough to
know what I'm talking about.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.827
We're screwed.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.164
Uh, forgot sugar cubes.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.300
Might want to think
about making a list.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.768
That's a great idea.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.136
I don't have time now,

10:36.203 --> 10:38.105
but maybe I'll swing by later
for some paper.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.674
How's that short story
coming along?

10:40.741 --> 10:42.710
Haven't really
gotten much done

10:42.776 --> 10:44.311
since I saw you
eight minutes ago.

10:44.377 --> 10:47.147
Well, I don't know
if you can use it or not,

10:47.214 --> 10:49.416
but I made you this.

10:50.684 --> 10:51.719
I used an old fast food bag

10:51.785 --> 10:52.753
that was in my van.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.421
It's really good.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.024
Thanks. I didn't know if your
story was gonna have pictures,

10:57.090 --> 10:58.859
but most good ones do, so...

10:58.926 --> 11:00.828
I wasn't planning
on it, but maybe.

11:02.429 --> 11:05.733
In my story, it's really more
of a metaphorical elephant.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.100
Oh. Well, I don't think

11:07.167 --> 11:08.902
anyone'll know
what species it is.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.671
I drew it pretty generic.

11:12.940 --> 11:13.841
VIRGINIA:
Keep it coming.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.508
A little to the left.

11:15.575 --> 11:16.844
What's going on?

11:16.910 --> 11:19.312
JIMMY:
What are you guys doing?

11:19.379 --> 11:22.482
Uh... your baby's trapped
in your mother's clutter.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.217
(grunts softly)
What?

11:25.618 --> 11:27.154
Is she okay?
Can she breathe?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.356
She's fine. She doesn't
even know she's trapped.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.658
Don't worry, your father's
gonna suck her out.

11:31.725 --> 11:32.760
BURT:
She's in good hands.

11:32.826 --> 11:33.961
Remember how
delicately

11:34.027 --> 11:35.462
I vacuumed out
that dead squirrel

11:35.528 --> 11:37.597
from the bottom of the
Wassermans' pool last week?

11:37.664 --> 11:40.133
Not a bruise on it; little fella
could've had an open-casket.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.668
What did you...
How the hell did this happen?

11:41.735 --> 11:44.137
Well, you went out
for ice cream

11:44.204 --> 11:46.807
and had unprotected sex
with a serial killer.
No,

11:46.874 --> 11:48.441
no, no, you can't
keep going to that.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.044
I left you guys in charge of
Hope, and now she's trapped

11:51.111 --> 11:53.613
under a giant pile of crap
because you're a hoarder.
BURT: Jimmy...

11:53.680 --> 11:55.315
(vacuum starts)
leave her alone.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.150
I was supposed
to be watching her,

11:57.217 --> 11:59.486
and I got distracted
by the lottery numbers.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.355
Oh, I can see why you
couldn't miss that.
I assume you won?

12:02.422 --> 12:04.357
No. Why would you assume that?
Did you hear something?
(thump)

12:04.424 --> 12:05.793
Did they do
a re-draw or something?

12:05.859 --> 12:07.394
I got her!

12:07.460 --> 12:08.561
(Hope cooing)

12:08.628 --> 12:11.098
(vacuum whirring)

12:12.665 --> 12:16.069
JIMMY:
Make sure the suction's
not too high.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.705
I don't want to have to explain
a hickey on her ass to day care.

12:18.772 --> 12:19.907
BURT: Here she comes.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.643
In the home stretch.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.879
(sighs)
Great.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.348
Now she's gonna
pee on my stuff.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.057
Where is she?

12:37.124 --> 12:39.893
(chuckles)
She's all the way
in the back again.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.962
She's quick. She
makes it through this,

12:42.029 --> 12:44.231
you got quite
a little athlete
on your hands.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.599
Oh, this is crazy.

12:46.666 --> 12:47.767
I'm going in.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.236
Don't touch that!

12:49.302 --> 12:50.170
(clattering)

12:50.237 --> 12:51.939
If you move
the wrong thing,

12:52.005 --> 12:54.041
it could all come
crashing down.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.479
* *

13:02.449 --> 13:06.553
* Istanbul was Constantinople,
now it's Istanbul *

13:06.619 --> 13:09.156
* Not Constantinople, been a
long time gone, Constantinople *

13:09.222 --> 13:11.524
* Now it's Turkish delight
on a moonlit night *

13:11.591 --> 13:14.661
* Every gal in Constantinople
lives in Istanbul *

13:14.727 --> 13:16.063
* Not Constantinople *

13:16.129 --> 13:18.031
* So if you've a date
in Constantinople *

13:18.098 --> 13:19.499
* She'll be waiting
in Istanbul *

13:19.566 --> 13:21.701
* Even old New York *

13:21.768 --> 13:23.971
* Was once New Amsterdam *

13:24.037 --> 13:25.906
* Why they changed it,
I can't say *

13:25.973 --> 13:28.808
* People just liked it
better that way *
* So *

13:28.876 --> 13:30.510
* Take me back
to Constantinople *

13:30.577 --> 13:32.779
* No, you can't go back
to Constantinople *

13:32.846 --> 13:34.014
* Been a long time gone *

13:34.081 --> 13:35.582
* Constantinople,
why did Constantinople *

13:35.648 --> 13:36.749
* Get the works? *

13:36.816 --> 13:37.684
* That's nobody's business *

13:37.750 --> 13:39.319
* But the Turks *

13:40.420 --> 13:42.722
* Do, do, do, do,
do, do, do... *

13:42.789 --> 13:45.926
* *

13:45.993 --> 13:47.527
* Why did Constantinople
get the works? *

13:47.594 --> 13:51.098
* That's nobody's business
but the Turks... *

13:53.000 --> 13:56.103
* Istanbul... *

13:57.971 --> 13:59.539
(song ends)

14:03.043 --> 14:04.777
You're not gonna thank
your Great-Maw Maw?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.346
Thank you, Maw Maw.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.517
I like your pants.
Ah.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.185
Want to trade pants?

14:12.252 --> 14:14.821
Humor her-- she just
saved your granddaughter.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.890
I hate when
we do this.

14:16.957 --> 14:20.560
She always leaves tissues and
chicken bones in my pockets.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.833
(yawning): Hope
still asleep?

14:26.900 --> 14:28.035
Yep.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.802
What got you
up so early?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.972
Me? I had to do
a little baby-proofing

14:32.039 --> 14:34.041
in the backyard.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.318
Where's my stuff?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.655
Jimmy, what did you do
with my stuff?

14:48.721 --> 14:51.124
My stuff is gone.
Where-where's my stuff?

14:51.191 --> 14:53.160
Your stuff is where
it belongs-- in the dump.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.328
Burt, I need you.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.663
(groans)

14:56.729 --> 14:58.665
I know this is hard for you,

14:58.731 --> 14:59.766
but what happened
yesterday

14:59.832 --> 15:00.900
can't happen again.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.302
You guys put Hope
in danger because

15:02.369 --> 15:03.971
you're living
in a fantasy land.
You collect crap

15:04.037 --> 15:06.406
for a house we'll never have,
while Dad is busy checking

15:06.473 --> 15:08.108
for winning numbers
that he's never gonna get.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.776
Now that there's
a baby in the house,

15:09.842 --> 15:11.111
you need to start
concentrating on her

15:11.178 --> 15:12.279
instead of what you're gonna

15:12.345 --> 15:13.446
name your imaginary boat.
BURT: Hey,

15:13.513 --> 15:15.215
we don't have to talk
about that anymore.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.783
We agreed last night--
Cirrhosis of the River.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.051
What about you?

15:18.118 --> 15:19.719
You're so busy blaming
everybody else.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.354
Where were you when
your daughter got stuck?

15:21.421 --> 15:23.356
I was in the store
buying things to
keep her safe.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.492
Yeah, the grocery store,
which is five blocks

15:25.558 --> 15:27.260
further away than
the hardware store.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.029
Face it, Jimmy,
we're not the only

15:29.096 --> 15:31.398
illusional ones around here--
your daughter got stuck 'cause

15:31.464 --> 15:33.733
you were out chasing after
some girl that has a boyfriend.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.535
Fine, you're right.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.670
I'm doing the same thing you
guys are, and I need to stop.

15:37.737 --> 15:38.972
I need to focus on Hope.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.975
You're gonna give up on
this girl? I don't believe it.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.777
Well, I am. We all need to get
our heads out of the clouds.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.079
It took a little convincing,

15:46.146 --> 15:47.414
but eventually,
your grandma and grandpa

15:47.480 --> 15:50.450
understood what
I was talking about.

15:50.517 --> 15:53.553
From now on, we're gonna
pay more attention to you.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.823
For me, that means buying
all the groceries at once

15:56.889 --> 15:59.292
and avoiding certain lines.

15:59.359 --> 16:02.795
For your grandpa,
it means finding something else

16:02.862 --> 16:04.231
to do with his dollar.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.468
And for Grandma,
it means stepping aside

16:08.535 --> 16:10.870
and letting Guadalupe
and Loquesia duke it out

16:10.937 --> 16:14.141
for a 20-year-old Hamilton
Beachpopcorn maker.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.475
WOMAN: You always
get everything!
(grunting)

16:15.542 --> 16:17.144
I'm not gonna lie to you.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.711
Now that we're
living in reality,

16:18.778 --> 16:21.214
things have been a little
less cheery around the house.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.615
But we'll get through it.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.417
How was your day?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.719
Me?

16:26.786 --> 16:29.156
I scrubbed toilets.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.758
You?

16:31.824 --> 16:34.827
Cleaned pools, cut grass.

16:34.894 --> 16:39.266
MAN (on TV):
Still no winner in what
is now a $128 million jackpot.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.269
In case you missed it,
here were last night's numbers.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.106
Don't tell me those
were your numbers.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.674
Could've been--
I do quick picks.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.709
I guess we'll never know.
Damn it!

16:49.776 --> 16:52.712
Somebody ate all
the chewy chocolate
chip cookies.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.282
Okay, relax,
I'll go get some more.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.683
Oh, no, you won't--
you're going

16:56.749 --> 16:58.718
to that grocery store
to see that girl.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.887
If you go and talk to
that girl, I get to buy
a lottery ticket.

17:00.953 --> 17:03.690
I'm not gonna talk to the
girl-- I promised I wouldn't.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.892
You better not be--
'cause I passed a house

17:05.958 --> 17:08.495
this morning on Sycamore street
that was throwing away a chair

17:08.561 --> 17:10.697
that looked like
a high-heeled shoe.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.532
Would've looked great
in a walk-in closet.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.068
I didn't even slow down.
She's not even working tonight.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.569
She has class.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.740
Yeah, well, let's
just make sure of that.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.042
Burt, hold his face.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.313
Uh, what are you doing?

17:26.379 --> 17:27.547
VIRGINIA:
Just a little insurance

17:27.614 --> 17:29.749
to make sure you
don't break your promise.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.971
Your mom's
on the phone.

17:52.038 --> 17:54.141
She has lice again?

17:55.642 --> 17:56.676
Hey.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.078
Hello.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.317
You know you have "dork"
written on your face, right?

18:04.384 --> 18:05.785
Uh-huh. My mom did it.

18:05.852 --> 18:08.321
It usually comes off
in a couple of weeks.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.190
You might want to think
about wearing makeup.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.359
I tried that--
Makes me look like a dork.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.227
Kind of a catch-32.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.296
I thought you had class
Tuesday nights.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.265
Creative writing?
I dropped it.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.133
I showed my
dad my story,

18:20.200 --> 18:21.368
and he said it was "blah."

18:21.434 --> 18:23.170
Not that he's
a wizard with words.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.172
I'm gonna pick up
an accounting class.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.639
I can already punch numbers
without looking.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.709
Look, it's
none of my business,

18:29.776 --> 18:32.245
but if you really
want to be a writer,
you can't just give up.

18:32.312 --> 18:35.014
I mean, if you give up,
you'll never know
what could have been.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.316
What if you wrote
the best story

18:36.383 --> 18:37.384
anybody has ever heard?

18:37.450 --> 18:39.219
They could turn it
into a book,

18:39.286 --> 18:41.754
or even a movie,
you could win an Oscar.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.556
I'm not gonna win an Oscar.
You don't know that.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.325
Anything is possible,
unless you quit.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.126
You can't win
if you don't play.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.628
Think about it--

18:48.695 --> 18:51.564
how cool would it be
to win an Oscar?

18:53.099 --> 18:55.168
(laughs)
It would be pretty cool.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.503
I could stand

18:56.569 --> 18:59.406
onstage in my
Badgely Mischka dress and...

18:59.472 --> 19:01.974
thank Gabodurey Sidibe
for bringing my words to life.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.243
Sure.
I don't know

19:03.310 --> 19:04.677
what language
some of those words are in,

19:04.744 --> 19:05.845
but that's what
I'm talking about.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.648
Thanks.

19:08.715 --> 19:09.782
Yeah.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.551
I needed that.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.353
Where the hell'd you learn
to be so positive?

19:13.420 --> 19:14.421
It's infectious.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.790
I guess my parents
infected me.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.326
You're lucky.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.494
Is that gonna be all?

19:23.530 --> 19:26.299
No. I need one more thing.

19:26.366 --> 19:29.536
That's when I realized I
want you to grow up in a house

19:29.602 --> 19:31.671
where people dream.

19:33.340 --> 19:36.443
* *

19:39.979 --> 19:41.614
(cooing)

19:41.681 --> 19:43.516
Growing up with your
grandparents in this house

19:43.583 --> 19:46.152
left me with a lot of scars,
but it also left me

19:46.219 --> 19:48.421
with the confidence
that no dream is too big.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.423
We're definitely gonna have
a dishwasher that works

19:50.490 --> 19:52.859
when we get
our own place.
Hey, you know what?

19:52.925 --> 19:55.061
We're gonna get you a
pet monkey, little dude.

19:55.127 --> 19:57.264
Monkey!

19:57.330 --> 19:58.931
We didn't have the best life,

19:58.998 --> 20:01.368
but that didn't stop us from
hoping that one day we would.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.969
I'm telling you,
this job is great!

20:03.035 --> 20:05.905
People feel so guilty that
we're cleaning up their mess,

20:05.972 --> 20:07.740
that they clean up half
of it ahead of time

20:07.807 --> 20:09.242
and then they
give us free stuff!

20:09.309 --> 20:12.512
I got you a towel rack today
for when we buy our own house,

20:12.579 --> 20:14.647
and you and your pet monkey
have your own bathroom.

20:14.714 --> 20:15.682
Monkey!

20:17.817 --> 20:20.119
And when you're growing up
around a couple of dreamers,

20:20.186 --> 20:22.322
you can't help
but turn into one yourself.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.190
Hey, what's the jackpot
up to tonight?

20:24.257 --> 20:26.326
3 million.
Ooh, I bet we can get

20:26.393 --> 20:27.927
a big old house for that.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.596
And when you marry
that grocery store girl,

20:29.662 --> 20:31.364
you can come over
for Thanksgiving.

20:31.431 --> 20:34.267
We'll start with cognac
in the library.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.468
I don't know
if that's gonna happen.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.003
She's got
a boyfriend.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.705
She has a boyfriend now--
it doesn't mean

20:38.771 --> 20:40.106
she's always
gonna have a boyfriend.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.641
Yeah, he could die.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.176
People die every second--
there's one.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.177
There's another one.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.446
Oh, that could've been him.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.147
I may not be able

20:48.214 --> 20:49.716
to give you the perfect life,

20:49.782 --> 20:51.718
but I want you
to live in a house

20:51.784 --> 20:54.321
that makes you believe that
one day you can get it.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.689
That's why I'm gonna make sure
you never see your daddy

20:56.756 --> 20:58.658
stop dreaming, because
if you stop dreaming,

20:58.725 --> 21:00.527
you're just sleeping.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.267
Highfalutin.

21:08.335 --> 21:09.702
Excuse me?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.103
Another way
to say "ostentatious."

21:11.170 --> 21:12.271
Highfalutin.

21:12.339 --> 21:13.440
I looked it up

21:13.506 --> 21:15.107
in something called The Saurus.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.543
It's a cool book.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.144
It's like
the dictionary's cousin.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.879
Thank you.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.548
No prob... Wait.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.052
No conundrum.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.820
(both chuckle)

21:38.064 --> 21:40.900
CHILD: Thank you for watching
Raising Hope on Fox.
