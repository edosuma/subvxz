WEBVTT

00:02.306 --> 00:03.655
<i>Previously
on "Resident Alien"...</i>

00:03.699 --> 00:05.962
Ah!

00:06.006 --> 00:07.137
I'm Goliath.

00:07.181 --> 00:08.660
There is an alien
race that's planning

00:08.704 --> 00:09.487
to take over the Earth.

00:09.531 --> 00:10.967
- Wha...

00:11.011 --> 00:14.579
I do not know who they are
or what they are doing here.

00:14.623 --> 00:15.754
It's dangerous.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.234
<i>I need to find this baby</i>

00:17.278 --> 00:19.845
<i>so I can get the rest
of Goliath's message.</i>

00:19.889 --> 00:21.021
An alien!

00:21.064 --> 00:22.979
That baby belongs to me!

00:23.023 --> 00:24.633
Come to me.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.113
Run, baby!

00:26.156 --> 00:28.332
And remember, look both ways
when crossing the street.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.681
I've got good news.

00:29.725 --> 00:32.206
The resort company
has officially put an offer

00:32.249 --> 00:34.164
on the Grady land.
- What resort?

00:34.208 --> 00:36.427
You can't put
a resort in Patience.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.212
You were right about Ethan.

00:38.255 --> 00:39.648
He's not an alien.

00:39.691 --> 00:42.346
I think the real alien
might still be in Patience.

00:49.397 --> 00:50.833
<i>When I first came to Earth,</i>

00:50.876 --> 00:53.792
<i>I was forced to use
Harry Vanderspeigle's body</i>

00:53.836 --> 00:56.143
<i>to blend in.</i>

00:56.186 --> 00:58.101
<i>But over time
that body changed</i>

00:58.145 --> 01:00.060
<i>from just being a way
of hiding</i>

01:00.103 --> 01:02.845
<i>to who I became.</i>

01:02.888 --> 01:05.456
<i>And I am attached to it
the way I was attached</i>

01:05.500 --> 01:11.506
<i>to Asta and the way
I still am to her memory.</i>

01:11.549 --> 01:15.292
<i>She died a long time ago.</i>

01:15.336 --> 01:16.859
<i>And after so many decades,</i>

01:16.902 --> 01:18.991
<i>it's hard for me
to shed this skin,</i>

01:19.035 --> 01:24.127
<i>because it reminds me
of the way things used to be</i>

01:24.171 --> 01:27.087
<i>before everything changed.</i>

01:47.368 --> 01:50.066
<i>Offspring on my planet
do not form attachments.</i>

01:50.110 --> 01:52.677
<i>That is a purely human trait.</i>

01:52.721 --> 01:56.246
<i>So it was obviously the weaker
human side of the baby</i>

01:56.290 --> 01:58.640
<i>which made him listen
to Max's friend,</i>

01:58.683 --> 02:01.033
<i>that meat sack wrapped
in children's clothing.</i>

02:02.339 --> 02:04.689
<i>She told him to run away
from me.</i>

02:04.733 --> 02:07.127
<i>But I have something
she does not.</i>

02:07.170 --> 02:09.781
<i>I speak the baby's language.</i>

02:20.140 --> 02:21.793
I feel like Erin Brockovich,

02:21.837 --> 02:26.450
testing water
and solving crimes.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.539
Maybe one day
they'll make a movie about me.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.802
Hmm, you know,
if they do make a movie,

02:30.846 --> 02:32.195
I want to play myself,

02:32.239 --> 02:34.545
a handsome, rugged sheriff
keeping the streets safe

02:34.589 --> 02:36.504
in a quaint Colorado town, right,

02:36.547 --> 02:38.810
until Bigfoot shows up
to kill everybody.

02:38.854 --> 02:40.769
But I recognize
his beautiful soul,

02:40.812 --> 02:42.249
and I teach him
to speak English.

02:42.292 --> 02:43.815
He teaches me how
to play the guitar.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.122
See, that's a movie.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.038
That sounds like a movie
that's about just you,

02:49.081 --> 02:51.780
and it has nothing to do
with environmental justice.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.390
It's gotta do with America
wanting to see me sing

02:53.434 --> 02:57.177
a duet with Bigfoot.

02:57.220 --> 03:00.702
My God. That's off the charts.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.007
Yup.

03:02.051 --> 03:04.445
This water's poison.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.708
Maybe we should
take a look at a map

03:06.751 --> 03:09.232
and see what's upstream
that could cause this.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.842
No, police work
ain't done with no map.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.017
It's more tactile.

03:12.061 --> 03:14.194
Police work is done
in the real world.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.021
Come on. Let's go.

03:16.065 --> 03:17.371
Hey, you know what?

03:17.414 --> 03:19.634
Maybe in my movie, I got
a trusty sidekick, right,

03:19.677 --> 03:21.244
who does all the paperwork.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.637
And I'm just
spitballing here, right,

03:22.680 --> 03:24.421
but maybe she provides
comic relief,

03:24.465 --> 03:26.249
'cause she's always
bumping into things.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.556
You see?
You see how I said "she" right?

03:28.599 --> 03:30.775
That's 'cause I believe
in equality.

03:30.819 --> 03:34.301
Yes, you are a true
champion for women everywhere.

03:39.262 --> 03:40.220
I need to talk to you.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.570
I like Halloween!

03:42.613 --> 03:46.051
I think it is funny
that humans like decorating

03:46.095 --> 03:47.531
with other dead humans.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.751
I am pretending
that this gentleman

03:49.794 --> 03:52.797
worked at a grocery store
before he was murdered.

03:52.841 --> 03:54.190
Cool.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.018
Look, I need more information
on this alien race

03:56.061 --> 03:57.976
that you said is trying
to take over the Earth.

03:58.020 --> 03:59.587
You know, I was on the
internet the other day,

03:59.630 --> 04:02.329
and there's something
called Insectoids,

04:02.372 --> 04:04.374
like a big, giant bug
person alien thing.

04:04.418 --> 04:05.767
I-I--what the hell?

04:05.810 --> 04:07.899
I do not want to be squashed
by a big bug person.

04:07.943 --> 04:10.162
The internet is wrong.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.730
Oh, okay.

04:12.774 --> 04:13.992
Good.

04:14.036 --> 04:16.560
No, the Insectoids,
they do not squash.

04:16.604 --> 04:18.910
They like to eat other beings

04:18.954 --> 04:22.871
while they are still alive
and struggling.

04:22.914 --> 04:25.787
You're not helping.

04:25.830 --> 04:28.572
There are so
many alien races.

04:28.616 --> 04:32.881
There are Tall Whites, Arcturians.

04:32.924 --> 04:35.884
There are Blue Avians,
which are very beautiful

04:35.927 --> 04:39.975
if you are attracted
to bird faces,

04:40.018 --> 04:41.977
which, of course, I am.

04:42.020 --> 04:45.285
I will not know which alien
race is here until I receive

04:45.328 --> 04:48.200
the rest of Goliath's message.

04:48.244 --> 04:52.292
You can thank Max's stupid
friend for interfering.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.858
You can't blame Sahar.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.599
She was just trying
to take care of the baby.

04:55.643 --> 04:58.559
I was taking
care of it first.

04:58.602 --> 05:00.169
It should have jumped
into my arms

05:00.212 --> 05:01.866
when I did my alien call.

05:01.910 --> 05:04.478
Well, maybe your alien call
doesn't work the way it used to

05:04.521 --> 05:07.611
because you're not
as alien as you used to be.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.700
That is an awful
thing to say.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.398
Let's face it, Harry.

05:11.441 --> 05:14.792
Every day you're here,
you become more human.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.011
It's inevitable.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.621
I mean, look at
what happened to Goliath.

05:17.665 --> 05:20.276
He was an alien,
and look how human he became.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.759
No, I am an alien.

05:24.802 --> 05:28.153
That is who I am on the inside.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.373
Goliath was weak. I am not.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.940
As long as I am on this planet,

05:31.983 --> 05:36.161
I am going to be an
alien who appreciates

05:36.205 --> 05:38.816
other aliens with bird faces.

05:40.252 --> 05:43.734
And hot, sexy worm breath,

05:43.778 --> 05:47.521
and wind blowing through
the feathers in their hair.

05:49.523 --> 05:51.786
Thanks for nothing.

05:54.745 --> 05:57.705
"I do not wear my seat belt."

06:02.057 --> 06:03.580
What?

06:03.624 --> 06:06.453
What's this we looking at here,
Deputy?

06:06.496 --> 06:10.326
Oh, yeah,
this is an impoundment pond.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.677
It's how mining companies
dispose and hide their waste.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.200
In the middle
of Mother Nature?

06:15.244 --> 06:16.941
You mean to tell me
all this here is toxic?

06:16.985 --> 06:20.118
Yes, and legal.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.729
All mining companies do it.

06:21.772 --> 06:26.298
they just keep the waste
in these manmade dams.

06:26.342 --> 06:27.474
Hmm.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.522
Unless...

06:32.566 --> 06:34.219
Oh, yeah, see, there it is.

06:34.263 --> 06:35.307
There's nothing I love more

06:35.351 --> 06:36.874
than a perfectly timed
"unless."

06:36.918 --> 06:39.181
It's like--it's like a spoon
being dipped into some soup.

06:39.224 --> 06:42.532
Go ahead, bring that
soup to my lips, Deputy.

06:42.576 --> 06:45.013
Unless there's been a leak

06:45.056 --> 06:46.928
and they've been trying
to hide it.

06:49.191 --> 06:52.455
Did I ever tell you
you're brilliant, hmm?

06:52.499 --> 06:53.717
No, sir.

06:53.761 --> 06:54.892
You see, you remember
how I didn't want

06:54.936 --> 06:55.980
to just look at the map, right?

06:56.024 --> 06:57.634
And then
your brilliance allowed

06:57.678 --> 07:00.898
my super brilliance
to shine through.

07:00.942 --> 07:04.772
Once again you are
the hero of your own story.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.904
Hey!

07:06.948 --> 07:08.602
Do you wanna go to the comic
book store after school

07:08.645 --> 07:10.995
to buy the latest Dr. McNinja?

07:11.039 --> 07:13.607
Ugh, the carefree
life of a child.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.478
Was I ever that young?

07:15.522 --> 07:19.047
Sorry, I'm gonna be busy
saving the world.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.918
I'm going out
to the woods after school.

07:20.962 --> 07:23.530
I'm hoping the baby alien
comes back to the RV.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.183
Cool,
I'll go with you and help.

07:25.227 --> 07:26.707
No, thanks.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.491
I can go by myself.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.101
Look,
I know you don't trust me

07:30.145 --> 07:31.755
because I told Harry
about the baby.

07:31.799 --> 07:35.150
I promise I won't
tell him this time.

07:35.193 --> 07:37.108
Okay,
but this is your last chance.

07:40.242 --> 07:42.549
Nothing healthy, please.

07:42.592 --> 07:45.116
Aw, come on, Max,

07:45.160 --> 07:47.336
you gotta eat everything
on your plate.

07:49.512 --> 07:50.687
Aw, carrots?

07:50.731 --> 07:51.645
It's good for you.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.954
How did she know your name?

07:56.998 --> 07:58.739
Oh, I'm pretty
famous around here

07:58.782 --> 08:02.569
ever since I broke
the taco record.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.362
Nothing here.

08:13.405 --> 08:15.233
No alien baby.

08:15.277 --> 08:16.496
This is horrible.

08:16.539 --> 08:17.975
What if he never comes back?

08:18.019 --> 08:20.543
I haven't even taught him
to tie his shoes yet.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.805
I wish I could
make those sounds

08:21.849 --> 08:24.547
Harry makes to lure him back.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.687
Ow.

08:33.730 --> 08:36.428
What's wrong?

08:36.472 --> 08:39.170
My stomach, it hurts.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.564
It can't be food poisoning.
We just ate.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.613
Oh, no.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.528
What?

08:48.571 --> 08:49.616
Did you notice
anything different

08:49.659 --> 08:52.532
about that new lunch lady,
Agnes?

08:52.575 --> 08:55.535
She had less hair on her face
than the other lunch ladies?

08:55.578 --> 08:59.539
Yes, and her watch,
that was no lunch lady watch.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.062
It was military.

09:01.105 --> 09:02.890
She might be MIB.

09:02.933 --> 09:05.022
That's probably how
she knew your name.

09:05.066 --> 09:09.287
Maybe she put a tracking
device in your food.

09:09.331 --> 09:10.941
You need to poop it out.

09:10.985 --> 09:11.812
I can't.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.030
I only poop after breakfast

09:13.074 --> 09:15.076
or when my mom takes me
to the bookstore.

09:20.342 --> 09:23.954
Then we have
to speed things along.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.695
Here.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.567
That's way too big
to swallow.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.917
It's not for swallowing.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.180
No, I'm not putting
that up my butt.

09:32.223 --> 09:36.924
Come on, the survival
of the world is at stake.

09:36.967 --> 09:39.274
I can save the world
with my butt?

09:39.317 --> 09:41.406
You have to.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.583
It's your destiny.

09:44.584 --> 09:48.500
Okay.

09:48.544 --> 09:51.286
Me and my butt will do it.

09:52.156 --> 09:55.159
It seems the pond is owned
by a shell company

09:55.203 --> 09:56.900
controlled
by the Galvan/Powell Group,

09:56.944 --> 09:58.641
which we know
was the same company

09:58.685 --> 10:00.208
Tanner Corrington worked for.

10:00.251 --> 10:02.645
Apparently, the tainted water
is leaking heavy metals

10:02.689 --> 10:04.255
into Hawthorne Creek,

10:04.299 --> 10:06.736
which explains the symptoms
we found in the medical files

10:06.780 --> 10:08.216
in Corrington's car.

10:08.259 --> 10:10.610
Okay, so what does this have
to do with Sam's murder?

10:10.653 --> 10:11.959
Yeah.

10:12.002 --> 10:14.178
This Corrington guy
obviously knew his company

10:14.222 --> 10:16.528
was responsible
and tried to cover it up,

10:16.572 --> 10:18.095
but Sam must have
figured it out

10:18.139 --> 10:19.836
based on
his patients' illnesses.

10:19.880 --> 10:20.924
Yeah,
we believe Tanner Corrington

10:20.968 --> 10:22.230
tried to shut Sam up.

10:22.273 --> 10:24.058
And when Sam refused
to play ball,

10:24.101 --> 10:26.190
he killed him
and stole his medical files.

10:26.234 --> 10:27.627
So what next, Sheriff?

10:27.670 --> 10:30.064
How are you gonna get justice
for Sam?

10:30.107 --> 10:32.022
The case is being kicked
up the ladder

10:32.066 --> 10:33.807
to the FBI.
- Yeah.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.026
But the Galvan-Powell Group,
they're done for.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.158
There's going to be lawsuits.

10:37.201 --> 10:38.725
People are going to
be getting fired.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.204
People going to jail.

10:40.248 --> 10:42.076
Mm-hmm, except we won't
get credit for that.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.730
You know,
we did all the hard work.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.775
Now the FBI'S going to come in
and just reach into our pants

10:45.819 --> 10:48.691
and rip off our bean bags.

10:48.735 --> 10:51.781
Oh, not me.
I don't have a bean bag.

10:51.825 --> 10:54.001
Well, not on the outside.

10:54.044 --> 10:55.437
I don't really
know what that means.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.309
Well, I am so sorry
you're not gonna get credit

10:58.353 --> 11:00.660
for any of this.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.313
Uh, listen, Mrs. Hodges,

11:02.357 --> 11:04.620
everyone here knows
you've been through a lot.

11:04.664 --> 11:08.319
And we feel it's our duty
to try to make it right, okay?

11:08.363 --> 11:11.148
So on behalf of the entire
sheriff's department,

11:11.192 --> 11:15.239
I'd like you to have
this limited-edition

11:15.283 --> 11:18.808
Patience County Sheriff's
Department baseball cap.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.592
It's actually been
worn by a sheriff,

11:20.636 --> 11:23.465
which makes it more special.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.380
You don't have to take that.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.991
A baseball cap?

11:28.035 --> 11:31.038
I was arrested,
and I lost my home.

11:31.081 --> 11:32.909
Okay, well,
some people consider

11:32.953 --> 11:35.782
a baseball cap to be
a home for your head.

11:37.522 --> 11:40.525
You probably should
have just said sorry.

11:40.569 --> 11:41.962
I was just trying to help.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.746
I mean, it's a nice hat.
Who wouldn't want this hat?

11:43.790 --> 11:45.356
Well, obviously, you didn't,

11:45.400 --> 11:47.794
because I gave it to you
for Christmas.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.666
What? It's...

11:50.710 --> 11:51.841
You know what?
Excuse me for trying

11:51.885 --> 11:53.495
to be a ray of sunshine.

11:55.062 --> 11:57.281
Oh, put your pants back on.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.980
I do not want to have
sex games on you.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.764
It's my knee.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.244
It's killing me.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.725
- Ew.
- I've been training a lot.

12:05.768 --> 12:06.856
I think I overdid it.

12:06.900 --> 12:10.686
Then stop training.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.864
You're welcome.
- I can't stop.

12:14.908 --> 12:18.041
I have a ski tournament
coming up.

12:18.085 --> 12:19.260
I need you to look at it.

12:22.263 --> 12:23.743
Fine.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.614
Thank you.

12:25.657 --> 12:29.313
I used to train like this
15 years ago, no problem.

12:31.838 --> 12:35.798
Your knee is compensating
for your tibiofibular joint

12:35.842 --> 12:39.497
that you injured
in your ski accident.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.848
Also, you are very old,

12:41.891 --> 12:43.893
and your body is falling apart

12:43.937 --> 12:46.026
as it prepares for your death.

12:46.069 --> 12:48.898
Yeah, can you just...

12:48.942 --> 12:52.989
you know,
tell me you can fix it?

12:53.033 --> 12:55.687
I have to ski
in this tournament.

12:55.731 --> 12:56.950
Skiing is the only thing

12:56.993 --> 13:00.475
that I've ever been really
any good at.

13:00.518 --> 13:01.868
So If I can't--

13:01.911 --> 13:05.349
if I can't ski
in this tournament,

13:05.393 --> 13:08.439
I don't know...

13:08.483 --> 13:12.835
I just... please.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.664
You can ski.

13:15.707 --> 13:20.016
Yes, you can do it.

13:20.060 --> 13:23.628
I believe in you.

13:23.672 --> 13:26.849
- Really?
- Yes.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.155
It's just a pulled muscle.

13:28.198 --> 13:30.592
I'm going to give
you some medicine.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.159
Okay.

13:32.202 --> 13:38.948
This will be for your pain
and also for your swelling.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.515
You will have
a child's knee again,

13:40.558 --> 13:44.301
and you will not die
for many years.

13:44.345 --> 13:45.302
Thank you.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.522
It's such--it's such a relief.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.004
Thanks.
- Oh...

13:51.047 --> 13:53.702
<i>Why did I just say
all of that?</i>

13:53.745 --> 13:55.747
<i>I only care about Asta,</i>

13:55.791 --> 13:59.055
<i>so why did I just
give hope and encouragement</i>

13:59.099 --> 14:01.623
<i>to another human?</i>

14:01.666 --> 14:05.322
<i>Am I beginning to care
about all humans?</i>

14:05.366 --> 14:08.108
<i>What kind of monster
have I become?</i>

14:12.373 --> 14:14.897
The main structure
will be a five-star spa

14:14.941 --> 14:18.553
and a piazza with shops
and restaurants.

14:18.596 --> 14:19.902
And all the buildings
will be full...

14:19.946 --> 14:20.903
Sorry.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.209
Sorry to be late.

14:22.252 --> 14:23.558
Hey, guys. Sorry about that.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.560
Looks like a few more
excited citizens

14:25.603 --> 14:28.041
have arrived
to hear the good news.

14:28.084 --> 14:30.086
Welcome.

14:30.130 --> 14:33.960
As I was saying, it will be one
of the most exclusive resorts

14:34.003 --> 14:36.266
in all of Colorado.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.181
Question.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.487
I will answer questions

14:39.530 --> 14:41.837
after the presentation
is over, thanks.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.926
There is
a ten-year expansion plan.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.972
You can put your hand down.
I'll call on you after.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.625
An expansion plan
to add a golf course...

14:47.669 --> 14:48.975
How about now? Can I ask now?

14:49.018 --> 14:52.413
And as I said, you can
ask questions afterwards.

14:52.456 --> 14:53.675
An expansion plan...
- How about now?

14:53.718 --> 14:55.198
- To add a golf course...
- How about now?

14:55.242 --> 14:56.591
- And a...
- How about now?

14:56.634 --> 14:58.158
- A ski hill...
- How about now?

14:58.201 --> 14:59.637
- For year-round use...
- How about now? How about now?

14:59.681 --> 15:01.074
How about now? Now?
- With, uh...

15:01.117 --> 15:02.249
How about now? How about now?

15:02.292 --> 15:03.598
20% of the
revenue coming back...

15:03.641 --> 15:04.468
How about now? How about now?
How about now?

15:04.512 --> 15:05.817
To the town.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.471
- How about now? How about now?

15:08.733 --> 15:10.257
How about now? How about now?
How about now?

15:10.300 --> 15:11.606
How about now? How about now?
How about now? How about--

15:11.649 --> 15:14.609
Uh, D'arcy, I think you--
you had a question.

15:14.652 --> 15:15.871
Yeah, what about traffic?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.351
Yes.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.657
Isn't Main Street gonna be
wall-to-wall cars 24/7?

15:19.701 --> 15:23.966
Yes, I agree with our great
Olympic hero, D'arcy Bloom.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.664
More traffic
is great news for Patience.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.840
- Not at all what I said.
- I agree, traffic is tourism.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.407
Nope.

15:30.451 --> 15:31.756
Which is money in the pockets
of local business owners.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.194
Until all the small
businesses get pushed out

15:34.237 --> 15:35.238
by the bigger chains.

15:35.282 --> 15:36.761
Won't allow it.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.981
Or we die because the resort
destroys our environment.

15:39.025 --> 15:42.115
Exactly, big business already
poisoned Hawthorne Creek.

15:42.158 --> 15:43.290
Yes, thank you.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.555
I see word
has gotten out about that,

15:47.598 --> 15:49.078
and trust me, as a Hawthorne,

15:49.122 --> 15:50.253
I take the poisoning

15:50.297 --> 15:52.603
of Hawthorne Creek
very personally.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.866
Also, unrelated,
I would like to make a motion

15:54.910 --> 15:57.957
to rename the creek.
Any seconders?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.480
This isn't a court of law,
all right?

15:59.523 --> 16:00.481
- Hmm?
- Stay on point.

16:00.524 --> 16:01.961
Sure, yeah.

16:02.004 --> 16:05.486
Look, what happened
at the Creek To Be Renamed

16:05.529 --> 16:08.271
is exactly
why we need this resort.

16:08.315 --> 16:09.403
We can use the money
it brings in

16:09.446 --> 16:10.882
to help clean the creek.

16:10.926 --> 16:13.233
And Greensoul Properties
is known for their commitment

16:13.276 --> 16:14.712
to the environment.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.453
Even this model
they provided is made

16:16.497 --> 16:19.369
from recycled wine corks
and CDs and diapers.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.154
Oh, is that why it stinks?

16:21.197 --> 16:23.025
Oh-ho-ho-ho, baby!

16:23.069 --> 16:24.244
You tell him.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.855
- Hey.
- Sorry, sir.

16:26.898 --> 16:29.901
Hey, I was skeptical too,
but then I realized

16:29.945 --> 16:32.382
how much good this resort
could do for the town.

16:32.426 --> 16:33.862
The revenue that it brings in

16:33.905 --> 16:35.995
will bolster the public
services in Patience,

16:36.038 --> 16:37.387
like the school,

16:37.431 --> 16:39.433
new books, an athletic field.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.000
Not to mention
law enforcement.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.523
I mean,
when this resort comes in,

16:42.566 --> 16:44.873
we'll have the manpower
to protect everybody in town.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.875
Just think of it for a second,
24-hour surveillance

16:46.918 --> 16:48.790
on every citizen in Patience.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.096
- What?
- Absolutely not what we

16:50.139 --> 16:51.706
would ever want.
- Uh, is--is what we could do,

16:51.749 --> 16:52.968
but won't do, of course,

16:53.012 --> 16:54.230
because we don't live
in a police state.

16:54.274 --> 16:55.710
- Not yet.
- Never.

16:55.753 --> 16:57.538
- Someday soon.
- No.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.975
Okay,
everyone is here except Harry.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.020
Where is he?

17:02.238 --> 17:04.414
<i>It is happening too fast.</i>

17:04.458 --> 17:06.199
<i>I came here
to kill all the humans,</i>

17:06.242 --> 17:07.635
<i>but I could feel myself</i>

17:07.678 --> 17:10.420
<i>wanting to help
Asta's ski friend.</i>

17:10.464 --> 17:13.423
<i>It is bad enough that I never
fried their bodies to ash.</i>

17:13.467 --> 17:17.079
<i>Today I was trying
to make her human life better.</i>

17:17.123 --> 17:19.125
<i>What have I become?</i>

17:19.168 --> 17:22.215
<i>I have been hiding behind
this human mask for too long.</i>

17:22.258 --> 17:24.391
<i>Being in human form
must be allowing emotions</i>

17:24.434 --> 17:25.957
<i>to take over.</i>

17:26.001 --> 17:30.049
<i>The only way to fight it
is to return to my alien body</i>

17:30.092 --> 17:32.747
<i>and live the way
I was born to live</i>

17:32.790 --> 17:35.402
<i>in my familiar
frozen environment</i>

17:35.445 --> 17:40.972
<i>as an alien.</i>

17:41.016 --> 17:43.149
<i>I did not consider
there is no food up here,</i>

17:43.192 --> 17:45.107
<i>and I am already hungry.</i>

17:45.151 --> 17:47.457
<i>Aliens can also live
in cabins with meat freezers.</i>

17:47.501 --> 17:49.024
Hmm.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.378
We can't let
this resort happen.

17:55.422 --> 17:56.597
My dad's right.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.294
If they put a resort in here,

17:58.338 --> 18:01.863
you can just say goodbye
to Joe's Diner, the 59.

18:01.906 --> 18:03.821
All the money's gonna go
to big corporations.

18:03.865 --> 18:06.259
It's never gonna trickle down
to the locals.

18:06.302 --> 18:07.521
If they widen the road,

18:07.564 --> 18:08.522
the first thing
that's gonna go

18:08.565 --> 18:10.306
is Old Barrett Bridge.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.569
We have to do something.

18:15.964 --> 18:19.446
You were so great out there,
honey, so in command,

18:19.489 --> 18:21.622
very sexy.

18:21.665 --> 18:23.102
I don't know.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.582
It felt like there were
a lot of people against it.

18:25.626 --> 18:28.194
But there's also
a lot of people for it.

18:28.237 --> 18:29.804
That's just the way it is.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.632
When you became mayor,
you didn't have 100%

18:31.675 --> 18:33.199
of the people behind you.
- No, not even close.

18:33.242 --> 18:35.157
Only 16% of the town
actually voted.

18:35.201 --> 18:38.117
- Really?
- Yeah, I won with 49 votes.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.162
And I think 40 of those
were Hawthornes,

18:40.206 --> 18:44.253
so only nine people
outside my family voted for me.

18:44.297 --> 18:47.126
Actually, I voted
for myself, so that's eight.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.388
Everyone hates me.

18:48.431 --> 18:51.695
Honey, they--
they don't hate you, okay?

18:51.739 --> 18:53.610
Some just have
a different opinion

18:53.654 --> 18:55.308
about what's best for the town.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.397
A lot of...

18:57.440 --> 19:00.182
some...

19:00.226 --> 19:03.229
a few of them believed in you
as mayor,

19:03.272 --> 19:05.883
and now it is time
for you to guide them, okay?

19:05.927 --> 19:08.059
So ignore everyone
who disagrees with you

19:08.103 --> 19:11.802
and do what you think
is best for the town.

19:11.846 --> 19:14.327
I mean, I think the resort
is great for the town.

19:14.370 --> 19:17.417
You know, it's something
that everyone can be proud of.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.549
Then you're doing
the right thing.

19:19.593 --> 19:23.858
Yeah.

19:23.901 --> 19:27.514
Thanks, hon. I like this.

19:27.557 --> 19:31.213
You know, we--we're a team.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.475
Hell yeah, we are.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.347
Nothing can stop us.

19:42.268 --> 19:45.619
<i>Finally
I am in my natural alien skin.</i>

19:45.662 --> 19:47.708
<i>If living
in that human meat case</i>

19:47.751 --> 19:49.231
<i>was speeding up my humanity,</i>

19:49.275 --> 19:51.059
<i>I will spend the rest
of my time</i>

19:51.102 --> 19:53.235
<i>on Earth as an alien
in this Earth home.</i>

19:53.279 --> 19:55.150
Oh, son of a bitch!

20:01.287 --> 20:03.680
God damn it.

20:03.724 --> 20:06.553
Son of a bitch!

20:10.513 --> 20:11.688
Ow!

20:16.824 --> 20:18.086
Son of a bitch!

20:28.314 --> 20:30.403
Ahh.

20:30.446 --> 20:33.275
<i>It is not practical to live
in this alien body on Earth.</i>

20:38.193 --> 20:39.847
<i>I can return
to human form as long</i>

20:39.890 --> 20:41.631
<i>as I start acting
like an alien.</i>

20:42.719 --> 20:44.199
Mother of a whore!

20:44.243 --> 20:46.201
<i>The baby will only listen
to that little girl?</i>

20:47.289 --> 20:49.900
<i>Then I will do
the right thing.</i>

20:49.944 --> 20:52.294
<i>I will kidnap a child.</i>

20:53.382 --> 20:54.731
Son of a bitch!

20:59.127 --> 21:00.520
Hey.

21:00.563 --> 21:03.349
That lunch lady's not here.
The coast is clear.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.612
How come you're not
wearing a costume?

21:05.655 --> 21:07.701
We don't celebrate Halloween.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.616
There's no spiritual
meaning behind it.

21:09.659 --> 21:12.445
It's just a bunch
of kids walking around

21:12.488 --> 21:15.970
perpetuating the message
of witches, evil spirits,

21:16.013 --> 21:17.406
and satanic worship.

21:17.450 --> 21:18.929
Yeah, but also there's candy.

21:18.973 --> 21:22.063
I don't need to stuff
my face with sugar.

21:22.106 --> 21:23.325
Then why are
you eating honey?

21:23.369 --> 21:25.022
To soothe my throat.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.589
<i>I have to find the baby.</i>

21:26.633 --> 21:30.071
<i>I was up all night practicing
alien calling sounds.</i>

21:30.114 --> 21:32.203
<i>Obviously, going to
the RV and yelling out,</i>

21:32.247 --> 21:35.294
<i>"Baby, baby, over here! Baby?"</i>

21:35.337 --> 21:36.817
<i>Isn't gonna be enough.</i>

21:36.860 --> 21:39.080
<i>Yeah, I've been practicing
my Frankenstein sounds.</i>

21:39.123 --> 21:41.735
<i>Rah!</i>

21:41.778 --> 21:45.347
Well, I guess
that is it for me.

21:45.391 --> 21:49.003
We are both very
sad to see you go.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.483
Aren't you sad, Sheriff?

21:50.526 --> 21:52.093
Yeah, well, it was nice
working with you, Detective.

21:52.136 --> 21:53.747
But you're leaving
'cause we solved the murder,

21:53.790 --> 21:55.488
and that actually
makes me extremely happy.

21:55.531 --> 21:57.838
And he's also sad.

21:57.881 --> 22:00.493
I got you something.

22:00.536 --> 22:04.148
Courtesy of
the Jessup Police Department.

22:04.192 --> 22:06.281
Crime was down 20% last year,
so we had a surplus.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.717
Thanks.

22:07.761 --> 22:10.851
Should probably put this
crime tape around the sheriff,

22:10.894 --> 22:14.376
because he should be arrested
for being too handsome, right?

22:14.420 --> 22:17.292
Well, I mean,
he wouldn't serve much time.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.728
It's involuntary handsomeness.

22:22.079 --> 22:24.560
He can't help it.

22:31.959 --> 22:34.353
This was--this was fun.

22:34.396 --> 22:37.573
not the murder ring,

22:37.617 --> 22:40.489
but, you know, the--
the other stuff.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.273
Yeah, okay, then, well,
I got to get back to my desk,

22:42.317 --> 22:43.579
a lot of stuff to do.

22:43.623 --> 22:45.407
Deputy, let's go over
those new case files.

22:45.451 --> 22:46.800
Oh, what case files?

22:46.843 --> 22:49.411
You know, for the--
the big new case.

22:49.455 --> 22:51.021
Well, this was the big case.

22:51.065 --> 22:53.894
From the other--
the other big case.

22:53.937 --> 22:57.071
The bakery double charging
you for the apple fritter?

22:57.114 --> 22:59.856
Yes, that is the case.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.685
I got to find the receipt for
that, 'cause I want justice.

23:02.729 --> 23:04.905
All right. Thank you.

23:04.948 --> 23:06.428
You're welcome.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.517
Well, that's my cue to go, so...

23:08.561 --> 23:09.953
- Yup. Bye.
- Okay, bye.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.697
What was that?

23:14.741 --> 23:16.046
Why didn't you ask her out?

23:16.090 --> 23:17.526
She was waiting for it.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.920
Okay, look,
I like Detective Torres, okay?

23:19.963 --> 23:22.139
She's a pain in the ass,
but I like it, all right?

23:22.183 --> 23:23.967
She's smart. She's strong.

23:24.011 --> 23:25.882
She's very attractive.

23:25.926 --> 23:29.625
Just not aiming
to plant my roots

23:29.669 --> 23:31.410
any deeper here in Patience.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.586
Why not?

23:33.629 --> 23:36.327
Well, I've been thinking
a lot lately,

23:36.371 --> 23:40.114
and it might be time
to move back to DC.

23:40.157 --> 23:41.463
What?

23:41.507 --> 23:43.770
Oh, come on, Deputy,
you know me.

23:43.813 --> 23:46.076
I need the excitement
of a big case, you know.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.644
And the biggest case I ever
had here, it just ended.

23:48.688 --> 23:51.081
Hell, DC's got murders
as far as the eye can see.

23:51.125 --> 23:55.390
It's like a whole forest
of them in constant bloom.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.131
It's beautiful.

23:57.174 --> 24:00.221
It is.

24:00.264 --> 24:04.617
Now, if you'll excuse me,

24:04.660 --> 24:07.489
I got to go see
a man about a fritter.

24:07.533 --> 24:10.013
Come on here, Cletus.

24:22.373 --> 24:23.592
What are you doing here?

24:23.636 --> 24:25.551
I am here to kidnap you.

24:25.594 --> 24:26.943
I need you as bait.

24:26.987 --> 24:29.163
The alien baby
seems to like you.

24:29.206 --> 24:32.166
I do not understand why.

24:33.210 --> 24:35.430
All right, let's go.

24:36.953 --> 24:38.259
What?

24:38.302 --> 24:40.087
You're not the only one
who could use some bait.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.436
You know how to do
those alien sounds.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.611
Mm.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.004
But let's be clear.

24:44.047 --> 24:47.094
This isn't a kidnapping.
This is an adult-napping.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.530
No, it isn't.

24:48.574 --> 24:51.315
I squeezed through this window.

24:51.359 --> 24:53.535
I brought rope and tape.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.319
I left it in the truck.

24:55.363 --> 24:56.625
But I was--

24:56.669 --> 24:58.322
I'm kidnapping you.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.020
Actually,
kidnapping by definition

25:00.063 --> 25:01.543
is abducting someone
and holding them

25:01.587 --> 25:04.241
against their will.
I'm not resisting.

25:04.285 --> 25:05.721
I want to go with you.

25:05.765 --> 25:06.940
Then--

25:06.983 --> 25:11.161
oh, then I do not want you
to go with me.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.903
- You're resisting me?
- Yeah.

25:13.947 --> 25:17.298
Okay,
so I am adult-napping you.

25:17.341 --> 25:19.213
Glad we agree. Let's go.

25:19.256 --> 25:22.738
I was already going
to go before you said let's go.

25:22.782 --> 25:25.088
Okay,
so we're doing what I said.

25:25.132 --> 25:26.176
Follow me.

25:26.220 --> 25:28.439
No, you are following me

25:28.483 --> 25:31.007
from in front of me.

25:32.356 --> 25:33.401
Wait up.

25:43.019 --> 25:45.761
Baby?

25:45.805 --> 25:48.416
Mama?

25:48.459 --> 25:49.809
You came back.

25:49.852 --> 25:51.941
Your mama will be
so glad to see you.

25:51.985 --> 25:54.988
Let's go.

25:55.031 --> 25:57.730
<i>Come on.</i>

26:11.744 --> 26:15.791
Holy shit. That's the alien.

26:20.317 --> 26:24.234
<i>I discovered a long time ago
that humanity is a virus.</i>

26:24.278 --> 26:27.803
<i>It overcame Goliath,
because he was weak.</i>

26:27.847 --> 26:29.588
<i>But I am not weak.</i>

26:29.631 --> 26:32.808
<i>If Halloween
is a time for monsters,</i>

26:32.852 --> 26:35.028
<i>then I will be that monster.</i>

26:35.071 --> 26:37.639
Do not to touch my truck!

26:37.683 --> 26:38.901
I'm already touching it,

26:38.945 --> 26:40.555
because I'm sitting
on the seat.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.644
Besides, I'd like
to listen to some music

26:42.688 --> 26:44.733
while I'm doing
my first adult-napping.

26:44.777 --> 26:47.562
No, this is a kidnapping.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.824
I changed my mind.

26:48.868 --> 26:50.826
You're a terrible child.
I'm taking you home.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.436
You can't.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.917
I already told my parents I'm
staying at a friend's house.

26:54.961 --> 26:57.311
And I'm hungry.

26:57.354 --> 26:58.660
Let's stop somewhere
for a snack.

26:58.704 --> 27:03.099
No, I am in charge,
and I do not want food.

27:03.143 --> 27:04.535
Not even pizza?

27:07.234 --> 27:08.931
I could go for a slice.

27:08.975 --> 27:10.933
<i>Sahar, come in, over.</i>

27:10.977 --> 27:12.282
<i>Sahar, come in.</i>

27:12.326 --> 27:14.110
Sahar here, over.

27:17.679 --> 27:23.337
I'm going to get the pizza
with cheese in the crust.

27:23.380 --> 27:26.209
Sahar, come in, over.

27:26.253 --> 27:28.690
I couldn't find you
after school, over.

27:28.734 --> 27:32.259
I have your baby, over.

27:32.302 --> 27:34.304
No, baby,
you have to stay here!

27:34.348 --> 27:35.828
- Hey, Max.

27:35.871 --> 27:38.787
Happy Halloween.

27:38.831 --> 27:40.093
Hey, very good, son.

27:40.136 --> 27:41.181
You didn't tell us
you had a friend over.

27:41.224 --> 27:42.791
Who's this?

27:42.835 --> 27:44.532
Uh...

27:44.575 --> 27:46.752
Me baby.

27:46.795 --> 27:48.536
Sorry?

27:48.579 --> 27:52.845
He means he was dressed as a
baby at school for Halloween.

27:52.888 --> 27:55.674
His name is Bobby.

27:55.717 --> 27:57.980
Oh, well,
pleasure to meet you, Bobby.

27:58.024 --> 27:59.503
Welcome.
- Hi, Bobby.

27:59.547 --> 28:01.592
Why do you have to be
Sonny and Cher every year?

28:01.636 --> 28:02.811
Come on.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.944
Because they're an iconic
'70s couple,

28:04.987 --> 28:06.685
and this mustache
was expensive.

28:06.728 --> 28:08.121
You guys want
to come downstairs

28:08.164 --> 28:09.688
and have a bite before
you go trick-or-treating?

28:09.731 --> 28:13.126
Oh, hey, Bobby, ask me
what I've got for dinner.

28:13.169 --> 28:14.518
He's got stew.

28:14.562 --> 28:16.346
He's going to make a lame
joke and call you babe.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.174
Ah, it's not a lame joke.

28:18.218 --> 28:19.654
It's a clever joke.

28:19.698 --> 28:23.223
Okay, well,
see you guys downstairs.

28:23.876 --> 28:25.529
Actually, we're not hungry,

28:25.573 --> 28:27.096
so we're just going to
hang out up here.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.489
You're not going
trick-or-treating?

28:28.532 --> 28:29.969
You always loved doing that.

28:30.012 --> 28:32.145
- Yeah.
- Yeah, when I was 10.

28:32.188 --> 28:33.537
I'm 11.

28:33.581 --> 28:36.889
Okay, well,
looks like just and me, Cher.

28:36.932 --> 28:40.719
Are you hungry?
Because I've got stew, babe.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.982
- See? It never gets old.

28:43.025 --> 28:44.723
It never gets old.
- Too young.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.725
Close the door.

28:46.768 --> 28:47.813
All right.

28:50.250 --> 28:51.512
Bobby is a little odd,
don't you think?

28:51.555 --> 28:53.732
I know.
The baby costume didn't help.

28:55.385 --> 28:56.560
- Candy.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.258
Let the festivities begin.
You ready?

28:58.301 --> 29:00.826
- La.
-  Perfect.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.175
Happy Halloween!
Trick or treat?

29:02.218 --> 29:03.393
Hey, Ellen.

29:03.437 --> 29:05.047
Hello, constituents.

29:05.091 --> 29:06.919
Oh, come on in.

29:06.962 --> 29:09.138
Trick or treat?

29:09.182 --> 29:11.924
Wait,
who are you dressed up as?

29:11.967 --> 29:13.534
I love Patience.

29:13.577 --> 29:18.278
Patience is the best town ever.
- That's pretty good.

29:18.321 --> 29:20.280
And I somehow snagged
a hot wife,

29:20.323 --> 29:24.153
even though I'm a horrible
mayor and a total dork.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.764
Oh, well...

29:25.807 --> 29:27.156
both: That's not true.

29:27.200 --> 29:31.160
I happen to be
a pretty good mayor.

29:31.204 --> 29:32.901
Stop that.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.816
I don't talk like--

29:34.860 --> 29:36.600
I don't.

29:42.563 --> 29:44.086
Thanks for the trick.

29:44.130 --> 29:45.653
Here's a candy.

29:45.696 --> 29:49.222
Happy you spent $135 on that
jacket to wear it one time.

29:49.265 --> 29:51.311
We don't want candy.
We'll take beer.

29:51.354 --> 29:53.792
There's cookies in the pantry.
- Yes.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.750
Okay.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.447
Are we just going to let
them waltz

29:57.491 --> 29:59.101
into our house like that?

29:59.145 --> 30:01.800
She thinks I'm hot.

30:03.062 --> 30:05.629
Sahar, come in, over.

30:05.673 --> 30:07.457
Your baby keeps trying
to escape.

30:07.501 --> 30:13.463
Are you allowed to tie
a baby to a chair, over?

30:13.507 --> 30:15.291
No, baby, come back!

30:19.295 --> 30:21.645
Trick or treat?
- Happy Halloween.

30:21.689 --> 30:22.951
Here you go.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.953
Happy Halloween.

30:24.997 --> 30:26.085
Bye.
- Thank you.

30:26.128 --> 30:28.087
Thanks.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.218
Oh, hi.

30:29.262 --> 30:30.306
Hey, girl.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.004
Where's your costume?

30:32.047 --> 30:33.570
Oh, hey, D'arce.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.834
Benny, still rocking the
Sonny Bono Halloween thing.

30:35.877 --> 30:36.835
What is it this year?

30:36.878 --> 30:38.532
Does Sonny work
at a shoe store?

30:38.575 --> 30:39.533
Or is it crew practice?

30:39.576 --> 30:41.665
Oh, it is stew now.

30:41.709 --> 30:44.059
A little wordplay
never killed anyone.

30:44.103 --> 30:47.628
I'm just here to see
if Kate can come out to play.

30:47.671 --> 30:48.672
Tonight?

30:48.716 --> 30:50.370
Oh, I don't know.
It's Halloween.

30:50.413 --> 30:51.762
It'll just be
for a little bit.

30:51.806 --> 30:53.155
I'll have you back
before the night turns

30:53.199 --> 30:54.940
to teenagers egging cars.

30:54.983 --> 30:57.681
Also, do you have any eggs?

30:57.725 --> 31:00.075
Look, if you want to go out,
I can take care of things here.

31:00.119 --> 31:01.511
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:01.555 --> 31:03.209
You know,
Max is busy with his friend,

31:03.252 --> 31:05.385
and after everything you did to
help me with the presentation

31:05.428 --> 31:09.998
and you being so supportive,
it's the least I can do.

31:10.042 --> 31:11.608
Okay.

31:11.652 --> 31:13.393
Yes!

31:13.436 --> 31:14.829
It would be great--

31:14.873 --> 31:16.918
and just thinking out loud--
if a certain someone

31:16.962 --> 31:18.528
didn't come back later
and write "Mayor Dick"

31:18.572 --> 31:20.182
on my windshield, though.

31:20.226 --> 31:22.445
I would be hard to prove,
because somebody probably moved

31:22.489 --> 31:23.925
a plant in front of your
security camera that night,

31:23.969 --> 31:25.361
so come on.

31:25.405 --> 31:27.624
Ooh. Ooh.

31:27.668 --> 31:30.062
- Have fun.
- Oh, we will.

31:30.105 --> 31:31.628
Hold down the fort.
- I will.

31:34.283 --> 31:35.197
- Hey.
- Hi.

31:35.241 --> 31:37.721
Hi.

31:37.765 --> 31:40.333
Oh, I didn't know you
guys were all out here.

31:40.376 --> 31:41.638
Oh, yeah,
there's 12 more in the trunk.

31:41.682 --> 31:42.901
Get in.

31:42.944 --> 31:43.945
Oh, okay, well,
I'll follow in my own car.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.207
Oh, get in, girl.

31:45.251 --> 31:46.948
- Oh, okay.
- Yes!

31:46.992 --> 31:48.036
- Oh!
- Push her in!

31:48.080 --> 31:49.777
Oh, my goodness. Got it.

31:49.820 --> 31:51.387
Got her in.

31:51.431 --> 31:54.956
We're all gonna have to put
our frickin' seat belts on.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.131
Everybody ready?

31:56.175 --> 31:57.350
Whoo!

31:57.393 --> 31:59.439
Here we go!

31:59.482 --> 32:01.310
Trick or treat, bitches!

32:05.662 --> 32:06.794
Baby?

32:09.971 --> 32:13.322
Baby?

32:16.282 --> 32:18.458
Where did you go, baby?

32:21.156 --> 32:23.332
<i>Baby? Baby? Over here.</i>

32:23.376 --> 32:25.378
<i>Baby?</i>

32:27.510 --> 32:29.121
<i>Baby? Baby?</i>

32:34.604 --> 32:36.215
<i>Baby? Baby?</i>

32:36.258 --> 32:39.261
<i>Over here. Baby?</i>

33:01.327 --> 33:02.981
Ahh!

33:03.024 --> 33:04.504
No!

33:15.167 --> 33:17.647
He's gone.

33:17.691 --> 33:20.911
They took him.

33:20.955 --> 33:23.566
It's all my fault.
I made you stop for pizza.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.612
I wanted the pizza.

33:25.655 --> 33:28.397
I was in charge.

33:28.441 --> 33:32.358
I just wanted
one more day together.

33:32.401 --> 33:35.056
Now I'll never see
my baby ever again.

33:37.754 --> 33:40.192
<i>I have never seen her cry.</i>

33:40.235 --> 33:42.933
<i>If Goliath were here,
he would be affected by it,</i>

33:42.977 --> 33:45.501
<i>but I am an alien,
and I do not care.</i>

33:45.545 --> 33:47.982
<i>Goliath let himself
be so human,</i>

33:48.026 --> 33:50.115
<i>he probably
would have put his hand</i>

33:50.158 --> 33:51.725
<i>on her shoulder like this.</i>

33:51.768 --> 33:53.944
<i>And then he would say
something humans say</i>

33:53.988 --> 33:55.816
<i>to make each other feel
better like...</i>

33:55.859 --> 33:58.645
There, there, there,
there, there.

34:02.605 --> 34:05.565
<i>I am not Goliath,
so I will not do that.</i>

34:05.608 --> 34:07.306
<i>I am an alien,</i>

34:07.349 --> 34:09.090
<i>and I enjoy watching
children cry...</i>

34:14.922 --> 34:16.315
What are we doing out here?

34:16.358 --> 34:19.274
This is
the Old Barrett Bridge.

34:19.318 --> 34:21.668
Now, if they go through
with this resort,

34:21.711 --> 34:23.887
this whole thing is going
to be torn down and replaced

34:23.931 --> 34:25.889
by a four-lane highway
with billboards

34:25.933 --> 34:28.631
on either side advertising
"Injured at work? Call Jacob."

34:28.675 --> 34:31.112
Wait, is that why you
guys brought me out here?

34:31.156 --> 34:32.331
Because of the resort?

34:32.374 --> 34:34.550
Yeah, well,
you're the only one

34:34.594 --> 34:37.336
that can convince Ben
not to do it.

34:37.379 --> 34:39.903
Well, what if I don't want
to convince him not to do it?

34:39.947 --> 34:41.644
What if I actually think
that the resort

34:41.688 --> 34:42.645
would be good for Patience?

34:42.689 --> 34:43.994
Just come with us.

34:44.038 --> 34:45.692
We want to show you something
under the bridge.

34:45.735 --> 34:47.781
Please.

34:47.824 --> 34:49.522
- Okay.
- This way.

34:49.565 --> 34:51.045
Ooh.
- So...

34:51.089 --> 34:55.093
We used to come here
as kids

34:55.136 --> 34:56.094
and carve our names.

34:56.137 --> 34:59.619
Look, me, D'arcy, aww,

34:59.662 --> 35:02.709
and there's Kayla and Liv.

35:02.752 --> 35:04.624
Oh, this is amazing.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.365
Wait, is that--is that Ben?

35:06.408 --> 35:08.062
Did he carve
his name here too?

35:08.106 --> 35:09.629
Yeah, we all did.

35:09.672 --> 35:11.370
This was our childhood.

35:11.413 --> 35:12.893
Yeah, we used
to come here after school

35:12.936 --> 35:14.547
and sneak cigarettes.

35:14.590 --> 35:17.115
- I had my first kiss here.
-  That's right.

35:17.158 --> 35:18.942
Yeah,
Ben lost his virginity here.

35:18.986 --> 35:21.597
both: He did?
- Who...

35:21.641 --> 35:23.033
yeah, we--we don't
have to talk about that.

35:23.077 --> 35:24.557
Nope.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.473
Every square inch of Patience
holds some memory for us.

35:27.516 --> 35:29.214
And we can't let it be
wiped out.

35:29.257 --> 35:32.956
It's like wiping us out.

35:33.914 --> 35:37.178
Ben must have been Max's
age when he carved this.

35:41.748 --> 35:46.361
I--you know, I never had this
where I grew up, you know,

35:46.405 --> 35:49.712
a sense
of belonging to a place,

35:49.756 --> 35:52.019
like it was a part of you.

35:52.062 --> 35:53.977
Ohh.

35:54.021 --> 35:57.459
You can if you want.

35:57.503 --> 35:58.547
Really?

35:58.591 --> 36:00.158
Yeah, go for it.

36:00.201 --> 36:02.247
You puked with us.
You earned it.

36:05.772 --> 36:06.990
Okay.

36:09.645 --> 36:10.864
Okay.

36:23.659 --> 36:25.661
Here you go, girls,
on the house.

36:25.705 --> 36:27.489
Thank you
for opening up late, Dad.

36:27.533 --> 36:30.188
I may not have
an "open 24 hours" sign,

36:30.231 --> 36:32.102
but I have an unwritten
sign that says

36:32.146 --> 36:34.670
"I won't let anyone
in this town go hungry."

36:34.714 --> 36:37.064
- Aww.
- He's right.

36:37.107 --> 36:39.022
One Christmas
we had a huge snowstorm

36:39.066 --> 36:40.285
that knocked all the power out.

36:40.328 --> 36:42.635
Oh, yes,
he kicked on the generator,

36:42.678 --> 36:44.245
and then the whole town
piled in here

36:44.289 --> 36:45.290
for Christmas dinner together.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.248
Wow, that's incredible.

36:47.292 --> 36:48.815
I think that was the night
he decided to put

36:48.858 --> 36:49.990
another stall in the bathroom.

36:50.033 --> 36:52.035
Ohh.

36:52.079 --> 36:55.343
- That was so bad.
- Too much gravy.

36:55.387 --> 36:57.389
This town is incredible.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.347
I know change is inevitable,
but we really

36:59.391 --> 37:01.262
should have it on our terms.

37:01.306 --> 37:03.482
We need a new library,
not rich jerks...

37:03.525 --> 37:05.223
- Ugh.
- And oxygen bars.

37:05.266 --> 37:07.312
I know, or chain restaurants.

37:07.355 --> 37:10.184
I want to grow old
in this booth, come on.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.317
Let Max and his friends
discover the bridge

37:12.360 --> 37:15.668
like the way we did.

37:15.711 --> 37:18.671
I guess I never realized
how special,

37:18.714 --> 37:21.326
you know, this all is.

37:21.369 --> 37:24.503
So will you help us?

37:27.027 --> 37:30.596
Well?

37:30.639 --> 37:33.860
I carved my name, so...

37:33.903 --> 37:35.644
I'm one of you guys now.

37:39.387 --> 37:42.347
all: ♪ She carved her name,
she's one of us ♪

37:44.436 --> 37:48.744
<i>Humans form attachments
to other people,</i>

37:48.788 --> 37:51.660
<i>attachments to things,
to places.</i>

37:58.580 --> 38:00.321
<i>Sometimes
they are not even attached</i>

38:00.365 --> 38:02.018
<i>to what something is</i>

38:02.062 --> 38:04.934
<i>but a memory of what something
used to be.</i>

38:07.589 --> 38:09.461
<i>Or a dream
of what it might become.</i>

38:14.770 --> 38:18.731
Mmm.

38:18.774 --> 38:19.732
Harry?

38:22.387 --> 38:25.912
Oh, my God, you're okay.

38:25.955 --> 38:27.870
I got your text. I was worried.

38:27.914 --> 38:29.219
You did not text me back,

38:29.263 --> 38:33.528
so I ordered only one pizza
for myself.

38:33.572 --> 38:36.792
You texted 911
and then gibberish.

38:36.836 --> 38:39.882
I thought you were in trouble
and had a stroke or something.

38:39.926 --> 38:42.537
My message was very clear.

38:42.581 --> 38:46.802
I use abbreviations
like the kids do.

38:46.846 --> 38:51.285
"9-1-1, MIBstblnwahcybi?"

38:51.329 --> 38:53.374
No. What? What? What is that?

38:53.418 --> 38:54.549
It's abbreviations.

38:54.593 --> 38:57.770
"9-1-1, MIB" Men In Black. Ah!

38:57.813 --> 38:59.293
There's "STBLN,"

38:59.337 --> 39:02.470
stole the baby last night
with a helicopter.

39:02.514 --> 39:04.690
Can you believe it?
Question mark.

39:04.733 --> 39:07.301
What assholes.
Exclamation mark.

39:07.345 --> 39:11.523
"I am going to kill them
to get the baby back

39:11.566 --> 39:13.438
"so I can hear the rest
of Goliath's message,

39:13.481 --> 39:15.265
but first I am going to eat."

39:15.309 --> 39:16.658
That's a pizza emoji.

39:16.702 --> 39:18.225
Mm.

39:18.268 --> 39:20.619
"WA, question mark" Want
any?

39:20.662 --> 39:23.970
And "HMBP,"

39:24.013 --> 39:28.017
hit me back, player.

39:28.061 --> 39:29.410
It's all very clear.

39:29.454 --> 39:31.978
You're right. My mistake.
Very clear.

39:32.021 --> 39:33.153
How could I miss it?

39:33.196 --> 39:34.502
I'm not giving
you any of my pizza.

39:34.546 --> 39:36.678
You can order your own.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.898
Take your pick
from this coupon.

39:38.941 --> 39:40.421
What is all this?

39:40.465 --> 39:42.510
Why haven't you opened these?

39:42.554 --> 39:45.731
Aliens don't care
about human things like mail,

39:45.774 --> 39:51.301
except for the
free pizza delivery coupons.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.827
This package
is from Violinda.

39:58.308 --> 40:00.006
Harry.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.140
"I wanted my baby
to have this book

40:04.184 --> 40:07.230
so that he can get to know
his father through his work."

40:07.274 --> 40:08.406
Wow.

40:11.191 --> 40:14.499
Oh...

40:14.542 --> 40:17.458
Oh.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.417
These are all
Goliath paintings.

40:22.985 --> 40:25.205
Oh, my God.

40:25.248 --> 40:27.294
Harry,
look at this.

40:30.384 --> 40:33.082
<i>I understand
these human attachments.</i>

40:33.126 --> 40:35.737
<i>Change is difficult.</i>

40:35.781 --> 40:37.652
<i>I grew attached
to my human form</i>

40:37.696 --> 40:41.917
<i>until it no longer served me.</i>

40:41.961 --> 40:44.746
<i>But after wandering the Earth
for hundreds of years,</i>

40:44.790 --> 40:49.185
<i>my alien self has grown old
watching the planet die.</i>

40:49.229 --> 40:51.449
<i>Some humans are so attached
to their home</i>

40:51.492 --> 40:54.669
<i>that they would do
anything to protect it.</i>

40:54.713 --> 40:57.280
<i>Now I understand that.</i>

40:57.324 --> 40:58.673
<i>My home is this planet,</i>

40:58.717 --> 41:00.806
<i>and I will walk forever
if I have to</i>

41:00.849 --> 41:06.420
<i>searching for a way
to save it.</i>

41:24.569 --> 41:26.571
<i>A portal.</i>

41:26.614 --> 41:29.791
<i>Of course
they left these behind.</i>

41:29.835 --> 41:33.142
<i>I must be on one
of the planet's energy lines.</i>

41:33.186 --> 41:35.754
<i>Humans called them ley lines.</i>

41:35.797 --> 41:38.539
<i>If there is one portal,
there will be more,</i>

41:38.583 --> 41:43.152
<i>then I can change all of this.</i>

42:06.306 --> 42:08.395
That's my jacket.

42:08.438 --> 42:10.484
I'm barefoot.

42:10.528 --> 42:11.920
This is us.

42:11.964 --> 42:18.144
Harry, this is the day
you fought Jimmy.

42:18.187 --> 42:22.104
How could Goliath paint this?

42:22.148 --> 42:24.890
We were the only ones there.

42:28.720 --> 42:31.200
Yeah.

42:31.244 --> 42:33.812
Wait, wait, okay, um,

42:33.855 --> 42:35.683
<i>the signal was sent to you,</i>

42:35.727 --> 42:37.511
<i>and the murals
were made for you,</i>

42:37.555 --> 42:39.382
<i>but you told me
you were the only one</i>

42:39.426 --> 42:41.167
<i>who could understand them.</i>

42:41.210 --> 42:42.777
<i>And now this?</i>

42:48.261 --> 42:49.871
<i>Mio dios.</i>

42:51.090 --> 42:55.616
Augh!

43:20.902 --> 43:23.818
<i>This--this makes no sense.</i>

43:25.515 --> 43:30.390
Unless...

43:30.433 --> 43:32.784
you're Goliath.

43:32.827 --> 43:39.181
Mm.
