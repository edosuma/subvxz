WEBVTT

00:54.231 --> 00:56.692
That is yours alone to use.

01:09.339 --> 01:10.861
8 o'clock?

01:10.941 --> 01:12.663
8:15.

01:12.743 --> 01:14.577
Keep on practicing.

01:21.385 --> 01:23.462
Keep that out of sight.

01:26.923 --> 01:29.253
Tustin, my tests worked.

01:29.893 --> 01:33.326
It will scale up.
We can make our own fresh water.

01:33.406 --> 01:36.632
- We don't have to...
- Now is not the time.

02:17.975 --> 02:19.706
That's it?

02:20.544 --> 02:25.670
You know what? I think you are
holding some back for yourselves...

02:26.310 --> 02:28.292
...or else you're selling it outright.

02:28.372 --> 02:31.381
I can assure you, sir, we haven't.

02:31.461 --> 02:34.078
That's right. You know why?

02:34.158 --> 02:37.047
Because the great Ian Fien owns this ocean...

02:37.127 --> 02:40.971
...and he graciously allows you
and your people to live on it.

02:41.731 --> 02:46.769
And in turn, all he asks
is that you pay a tribute...

02:48.138 --> 02:50.973
...and in turn, he gives you fresh water.

02:51.678 --> 02:54.465
I don't think you're keeping up
your end of the bargain.

02:54.545 --> 02:58.635
Mr. Scrim, sir, we need more water.

02:59.115 --> 03:02.540
Double your tribute by tomorrow.

03:03.320 --> 03:06.570
We have exhausted all the resources nearby.

03:06.650 --> 03:09.246
It will take time to gather more...

03:09.326 --> 03:13.150
...but without water, it's impossible.

03:13.230 --> 03:17.320
So what you're saying is
this amount of water...

03:17.400 --> 03:20.424
...isn't enough for the population
you have here?

03:20.504 --> 03:24.363
- Exactly, sir.
- Oh. Hmm.

03:25.742 --> 03:30.167
By the authority of the Warlord Ian Fien...

03:30.247 --> 03:33.916
...I will reduce your population by 10%.

03:35.385 --> 03:40.456
Take five, six healthy ones, girls.

03:44.594 --> 03:48.085
Willow, this isn't the time to fight.
You want to honor your father, stay alive.

03:48.165 --> 03:51.967
- But what about you?
- I never had a father. Go.

03:54.071 --> 03:56.567
Mr. Scrim, sir, that's not what I meant.

03:56.647 --> 04:00.126
Double your tribute by tomorrow
if you want your people back.

04:01.244 --> 04:03.266
You can take me...

04:03.346 --> 04:05.823
...but release my people.

05:05.758 --> 05:07.593
There's too many.

05:15.268 --> 05:17.177
People of Korotoa...

05:17.257 --> 05:21.548
...prepare for the wrath of Ian Fien.

05:21.628 --> 05:23.896
Gentlemen, please.

05:33.340 --> 05:37.098
And now the retribution...

05:37.178 --> 05:41.781
...of Warlord Ian Fien!

06:08.742 --> 06:12.978
Hey, where are you going?
The fun's just started.

06:20.620 --> 06:22.097
Ooh.

06:24.290 --> 06:26.726
Oh! Hi, kiddies.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.689
Now hear me.

06:36.069 --> 06:38.525
You'll have double tribute by tomorrow...

06:38.605 --> 06:41.944
...or your people will become
the permanent property...

06:42.024 --> 06:45.678
...of Warlord Ian Fien.

06:47.514 --> 06:49.715
Thank you very much.

07:08.418 --> 07:11.441
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like I'm doing?

07:11.521 --> 07:13.610
- I'm taking this!
- You can't.

07:13.690 --> 07:16.079
- I can.
- What about the sharks?

07:16.159 --> 07:18.427
I'll go deep where they won't see me.

07:20.497 --> 07:22.970
Have you even soloed in that thing before?

07:27.704 --> 07:29.905
I made a promise to look after Willow.

07:31.574 --> 07:33.822
I'm keeping that promise.

07:49.365 --> 07:52.091
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

09:03.934 --> 09:06.489
I've never seen anybody do what he did.

09:06.569 --> 09:09.028
I've seen something like that before...

09:10.206 --> 09:12.007
...a long time ago...

09:13.009 --> 09:14.798
...but it was different.

09:14.878 --> 09:18.336
- What do you mean?
- It's hard to explain.

09:19.415 --> 09:21.283
I was just a little kid.

09:22.886 --> 09:26.321
There was someone who was similar...

09:28.074 --> 09:32.745
...but he respected the sharks.
He didn't use them like that.

09:33.516 --> 09:38.150
I always thought it was just a fairy tale
to make the kids feel safe in the water.

09:40.103 --> 09:41.970
It was true.

09:44.307 --> 09:47.743
- And where are they now?
- Long dead.

09:49.679 --> 09:51.883
But there may be another.

09:52.663 --> 09:56.323
You're sounding like the elders now.
Enough with the fairy tales.

09:56.403 --> 09:59.693
- How are we gonna stop him?
- One step at a time.

09:59.773 --> 10:02.796
First, we have to get Willow back.

10:03.826 --> 10:06.161
We have to rescue our people.

11:25.825 --> 11:27.781
Why are we surfacing?

11:28.311 --> 11:31.779
We have to get as close to the stern
of that trawler as possible.

11:35.784 --> 11:38.208
- Take the wheel.
- What... what are you doing?

11:38.288 --> 11:42.078
I'm getting Willow out. Stay hidden,
and if you get in trouble, dive, okay?

11:42.458 --> 11:44.680
You can't do this alone!

11:57.797 --> 11:59.594
Hey!

12:04.637 --> 12:07.095
Stowaway! Guys, over there!

13:31.000 --> 13:34.488
We... we won't be able to take much
of this. They'll sink us.

13:39.375 --> 13:41.691
- We have to get out of here now!
- What did you do?

13:41.771 --> 13:44.000
- Me? What are you talking about?
- We've got no thrust!

13:44.080 --> 13:46.836
I didn't do anything. It...

13:49.318 --> 13:51.185
It's loose.

13:54.690 --> 13:57.111
Okay, we're good! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

15:03.626 --> 15:06.049
- We can't stay here much longer.
- A little further.

15:06.129 --> 15:08.407
We can go deeper than they like to.

15:20.742 --> 15:23.411
I don't think we can stay here much longer.

15:32.989 --> 15:34.604
Are we clear?

15:34.684 --> 15:36.157
I don't know.

15:43.032 --> 15:45.089
We have to go up.

15:46.069 --> 15:48.059
We can't stay here much longer!

15:50.189 --> 15:52.056
We've got to go!

15:53.976 --> 15:56.678
Okay, let's ascend.

16:40.570 --> 16:43.492
I'll have the rest of the tribute
by tomorrow, I assure you.

16:43.572 --> 16:47.626
The people of Korotoa,
they've been specially motivated.

16:52.248 --> 16:54.315
Stop! Stop!

17:01.003 --> 17:03.572
Oh, I heard that the ship
bearing the components...

17:03.652 --> 17:07.030
...that we need for the wave energy
should be docking in Nauru any day now.

17:07.109 --> 17:11.435
Now, with those components, we can go
over to kinetic energy from the ocean.

17:11.515 --> 17:14.290
We don't have to use people
anymore, human power.

17:14.369 --> 17:18.174
The sooner we can end this
inefficient situation, the better.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.944
We'll still need captives for the sharks.

17:22.425 --> 17:24.480
All right, keep going.

17:46.349 --> 17:48.393
Whoa! Stop! Stop!

18:02.631 --> 18:05.088
Just keep your hands on the wheel, child...

18:05.168 --> 18:08.036
...and you keep pushing. Don't stop.

18:16.579 --> 18:18.781
You just keep one foot
in front of the other, child.

18:18.861 --> 18:21.210
You keep pushing, no matter what.

18:31.127 --> 18:34.918
- The Warlord is too powerful to fight.
- What about our people?

18:34.998 --> 18:38.121
If we do as he says, they will be returned.

18:38.201 --> 18:42.425
- You don't know that.
- Timor, you're young...

18:42.505 --> 18:45.895
...but when you're older,
you will think differently.

18:45.975 --> 18:48.331
They need us to power the machines.

18:48.411 --> 18:50.846
Killing us is not in their interest.

18:53.182 --> 18:56.072
Besides, we need the water they provide.

18:57.152 --> 19:01.578
If a few of us are to be sacrificed
so that the rest of us can live...

19:01.658 --> 19:03.859
...then that's a worthy sacrifice.

19:14.670 --> 19:16.471
What have you got?

19:20.743 --> 19:22.232
Where'd you get those?

19:22.312 --> 19:25.546
There are benefits to being
the one who cleans the oysters.

19:38.428 --> 19:41.025
Must have been some kind of life.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.805
You sure you want to do this?

19:51.360 --> 19:54.397
I made a promise to look after Willow.

19:54.877 --> 19:58.438
- I can't ask you to come with me.
- You don't have to ask, 'cause I'm coming.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.015
It's not a good idea.

20:01.317 --> 20:03.807
- Do you want those pearls to barter?
- Of course.

20:03.887 --> 20:05.845
Then I'm coming with you.

20:33.583 --> 20:35.610
Sun-stone.

20:36.519 --> 20:40.143
I've only seen one of those before.
Who gave you that, child?

20:40.223 --> 20:41.894
Was it your father?

20:41.974 --> 20:44.560
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.216
Did he teach you the old ways?

20:47.296 --> 20:49.852
He taught me how to navigate
by position of the sun.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.856
But did he teach you
the secret of shark calling?

20:53.936 --> 20:55.992
He was a shark caller.

20:56.072 --> 21:00.272
Most of us here survived the first days
of the flood because of him.

21:00.352 --> 21:04.167
He died when I was young.
This is all he left me.

21:04.247 --> 21:07.303
There must be a reason he left it with you.

21:07.383 --> 21:09.617
You have to help us.

21:35.891 --> 21:37.715
Your face!

21:38.694 --> 21:40.269
Her...

21:42.197 --> 21:43.698
Beautiful!

21:45.948 --> 21:49.442
- Hold up, buddy. What's in the bag?
- None of your business.

21:49.522 --> 21:52.029
We don't allow weapons or contraband in here.

21:52.109 --> 21:54.810
Oh, really? Uh, what's that?

21:54.890 --> 21:56.916
This? It's only ceremonial.

21:56.996 --> 22:00.318
- So's the bag.
- Give me that!

22:04.366 --> 22:06.434
You're asking for trouble!

22:08.804 --> 22:11.695
Great. What do we do now?

22:18.980 --> 22:21.232
I'm keeping this for my trouble.

22:23.035 --> 22:24.857
Do you know who that was?

22:28.124 --> 22:29.879
Wait!

22:29.959 --> 22:32.865
- You're Ann Aldrin.
- Been called worse.

22:33.595 --> 22:36.419
We have an opportunity,
a unique charter. We need...

22:36.499 --> 22:40.189
You need a few more bags like that
to start that conversation.

22:40.269 --> 22:42.570
I'm not interested.

23:01.123 --> 23:03.084
Come on!

23:15.171 --> 23:17.059
Come on!

23:41.330 --> 23:43.335
Where you going with that?

23:47.035 --> 23:48.903
And the rest of it?

23:49.972 --> 23:51.611
I'm finished with this.

23:51.691 --> 23:55.330
You're finished when I say
you're finished, honey.

23:55.410 --> 23:59.268
That's my tenth run today.
I'm winning this place dry.

23:59.348 --> 24:02.651
How long before all these suckers
realize they can't win?

24:03.751 --> 24:06.342
You'll just have to be
a little more creative.

24:07.022 --> 24:09.038
I work best at 50 fathoms.

24:09.218 --> 24:11.313
I do wet work, not dry.

24:11.393 --> 24:13.516
You're the idea man, I'm the free diver...

24:13.596 --> 24:17.053
...and right now you're not really
adding much to that equation.

24:17.133 --> 24:20.089
I got me ear to the ground for a big score.

24:20.169 --> 24:23.460
There's a freighter inbound
with some serious cheddar.

24:24.240 --> 24:28.464
In the meantime, we're gonna need
some more pocket money, honey.

24:29.544 --> 24:33.803
From now on, you'll be getting
your own pocket money.

24:34.983 --> 24:36.850
We're done.

24:42.558 --> 24:44.129
Usual.

24:53.034 --> 24:54.890
That was pretty good...

24:54.970 --> 24:56.804
...for an amateur.

25:00.042 --> 25:02.631
And I suppose you want to challenge me?

25:03.611 --> 25:05.134
No.

25:05.714 --> 25:08.107
I want to offer you more for your time...

25:08.187 --> 25:13.041
...an opportunity to get out from under
whatever hold that lowlife has on you.

25:13.121 --> 25:16.411
- What kind of con is this?
- It's no con.

25:16.491 --> 25:18.237
It's the opportunity of a lifetime.

25:21.096 --> 25:23.619
Yeah, I've heard that before.

25:23.699 --> 25:26.689
Listen. Someone with your skills...

25:26.769 --> 25:29.425
...shouldn't be wasting it on drinking money.

25:30.105 --> 25:33.161
Do you want to spend the rest of
your life with your head in a bucket?

25:33.241 --> 25:35.702
How 'bout I put your head in a bucket?

25:36.678 --> 25:38.546
No offense...

25:39.281 --> 25:41.348
...but you're better than this.

25:45.220 --> 25:46.948
Go on.

25:48.324 --> 25:50.791
You know Hawksbill Fortress?

25:51.693 --> 25:53.894
We're gonna crack it open.

25:57.399 --> 25:59.266
What do you say?

26:00.268 --> 26:02.433
I'd say you're buying me a drink.

26:04.440 --> 26:06.674
Come on. What are you doing to me?

26:14.115 --> 26:17.306
Is that thing for real,
or is it just for show?

26:19.388 --> 26:22.589
- Depends who's asking.
- That would be me.

26:23.258 --> 26:25.393
In that case, it's real.

26:42.645 --> 26:44.178
Stop.

26:45.981 --> 26:47.332
Left.

27:04.240 --> 27:06.133
I saw what you did.

27:08.303 --> 27:10.325
What did you see?

27:10.405 --> 27:12.828
- You pinged the shells.
- Excuse me?

27:12.908 --> 27:15.030
You know, like a dolphin would.

27:15.110 --> 27:18.579
It's acoustics and sonar.
We're not on the water...

27:20.749 --> 27:24.894
What really struck me is the skill
it must have taken to miniaturize that.

27:24.974 --> 27:28.991
- What do you want?
- I have a job opportunity.

27:29.191 --> 27:30.858
I'm retired.

27:32.227 --> 27:34.483
I noticed you gave away your winnings.

27:35.163 --> 27:38.086
If you really want to strike
back against the big man...

27:38.166 --> 27:40.022
...this is the job for you.

27:41.002 --> 27:43.070
I'll give you five minutes.

27:43.805 --> 27:48.764
So you want us to help you break
into Hawksbill to rescue your people?

27:48.844 --> 27:53.302
That's right. Edgar here will use
his sonic tech to ping the fortress.

27:53.382 --> 27:55.537
We can use his data
to map out the structure...

27:55.617 --> 27:58.687
...work out where all the captives are,
and see what other threats we may face.

27:58.767 --> 28:01.911
Toby, in his deep-sea
salvage suit, will go in...

28:01.991 --> 28:06.048
...crack open the weak spot in the fortress,
and that'll give us a way in.

28:06.528 --> 28:08.183
What will I do?

28:08.263 --> 28:12.755
You're a free diver. Your job will be to
lure the sharks away from the fortress.

28:12.835 --> 28:15.858
You'll get the Warlord's sharks
to chase you to a terminal depth...

28:15.938 --> 28:18.660
...giving us a clear shot
of infiltrating from below.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.929
The sharks will follow you,
but only to a point.

28:21.009 --> 28:23.465
We discovered that
when we were in our submersible.

28:23.545 --> 28:27.136
Once you get to a certain depth,
they won't be able to follow you anymore.

28:27.216 --> 28:29.134
And, uh...

28:29.214 --> 28:31.941
- ...what's in for us?
- Yeah.

28:32.021 --> 28:35.507
I'm sure that, uh,
some of this commands a high price...

28:35.587 --> 28:38.179
...in the outer atolls, but, uh...

28:38.259 --> 28:40.695
...I'm not sure if the rewards...

28:42.097 --> 28:44.520
...match the risks.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.154
The Warlord's been gathering tribute
from the neighboring villages...

28:47.234 --> 28:48.791
...for as long as we can remember.

28:48.871 --> 28:52.628
He's got a ton of loot, fuel,
and his own desalination machine.

28:52.708 --> 28:55.364
The Warlord has the means
to make fresh water...

28:55.444 --> 28:57.499
...more than any of us could ever need.

28:57.579 --> 29:00.736
Once we have that,
we can name our price anywhere.

29:00.816 --> 29:02.902
Okay, I got a question.

29:04.619 --> 29:07.294
Am I gonna be able to blow things up?

29:07.374 --> 29:09.431
Now hear me out, 'cause...

29:09.511 --> 29:14.349
...you know, uh, dive salvage,
that's... that's my specialty, right?

29:14.429 --> 29:17.239
But, uh, demolition...

29:17.319 --> 29:20.614
...boom, that's my reason detra,
like the French say.

29:22.004 --> 29:23.325
<i>"D'être."</i>

29:23.405 --> 29:26.028
- I know my French.
- <i>Raison d'être.</i>

29:26.108 --> 29:28.720
Anyway, do you think...

29:28.800 --> 29:33.002
...I, Toby, will be able
to give the big boom-boom?

29:33.582 --> 29:37.451
If the opportunity presents itself...

29:38.854 --> 29:40.742
...it's likely.

29:40.822 --> 29:42.913
Mm-mm-mm. I'm in.

29:48.096 --> 29:49.963
Yeah, me, too.

29:51.767 --> 29:54.715
This is against my better judgment entirely.

29:58.807 --> 30:01.730
- I'm in.
- Excellent!

30:01.810 --> 30:03.878
Now all we need is a boat.

30:12.620 --> 30:15.477
See you haven't lost any limbs yet.

30:15.557 --> 30:18.992
- That's encouraging.
- Thanks for helping us.

30:20.829 --> 30:23.952
- You don't belong here.
- We want to hire you and your crew.

30:24.032 --> 30:27.669
I'll give you the same answer
as before. Not interested.

30:27.969 --> 30:30.008
- You haven't even heard our offer.
- I don't need to.

30:30.088 --> 30:32.761
One look at you two tells me
everything I need to know.

30:32.841 --> 30:36.598
- You don't know the first thing about us.
- Oh, yeah? You're fishermen, right...

30:36.678 --> 30:41.882
...from some little village, God knows
where, from the looks of it, Korotoa.

30:42.317 --> 30:46.895
Someone did you wrong. Came here
with a big plan to make things right.

30:46.975 --> 30:52.694
Seen it before. Big plans from little
people end up getting people killed.

30:52.774 --> 30:56.080
And I, for one,
am not interested in dying today.

30:57.199 --> 31:00.756
So I suggest you return
to your home while you still can...

31:00.836 --> 31:04.661
...and next time you need saving,
I might still be around.

31:11.159 --> 31:14.119
Hey, there's plenty of other captains here.

31:14.549 --> 31:17.305
Hawksbill? The fortress?

31:17.385 --> 31:21.176
The one filled with enough sharks
to make Poseidon piss himself?

31:21.256 --> 31:23.946
Oh, boil your heads, you monkey halfwits.

31:24.626 --> 31:28.283
For sure.
I'll take you to Hawksbill Fortress.

31:28.863 --> 31:31.320
I drop you right off at the gate.

31:32.200 --> 31:36.092
I'm sure the Warlord would be happy
to reunite you with your friends...

31:36.872 --> 31:39.561
...and then feed you off to his sharks.

31:43.211 --> 31:46.715
Okay, just so I understand,
you want to hire me and my boat...

31:46.795 --> 31:50.183
...to take you to Hawksbill Fortress?

31:50.786 --> 31:52.824
I know how this all ends.

31:52.904 --> 31:54.955
You're all gonna die.

32:00.429 --> 32:03.064
No. No, thanks.

32:17.946 --> 32:19.813
We got a boat.

32:23.218 --> 32:25.640
How'd you do it?

32:25.720 --> 32:28.544
You know, we can be persuasive.

32:29.324 --> 32:33.081
Um, introduce me to the captain.
I want to go over the details of our plan.

32:33.161 --> 32:34.516
- That'll be you.
- What?

32:34.596 --> 32:36.417
The boat is ours.

32:37.019 --> 32:39.187
What do you mean, "The boat is ours"?

32:39.267 --> 32:41.823
- Where is everyone?
- Ah...

32:41.903 --> 32:44.160
...they're a bit, uh, tied up.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.807
Indisposed, I'd say.

32:47.843 --> 32:50.882
- You stole this boat?
- You know who you hired, right?

32:51.112 --> 32:53.765
The less you know, the better.

32:53.845 --> 32:57.588
- This is what we do.
- This isn't what we do! Right?

32:59.654 --> 33:02.276
Before you get all high and mighty...

33:02.356 --> 33:06.426
...you better take a look and see
what's down in the hold, eh...

33:07.562 --> 33:09.396
<i>...Capitano.</i>

33:10.832 --> 33:12.854
From the manifest...

33:13.834 --> 33:16.525
...looks like it's all bound
for Hawksbill Fortress.

33:16.605 --> 33:20.763
- What is it?
- This is a kinetic-energy harvester...

33:20.843 --> 33:22.898
...for their desalination machine, it seems.

33:22.978 --> 33:26.869
This looks like some kind
of kinetic-energy generator.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.550
Okay.

33:31.570 --> 33:35.330
<i>This is Hawksbill Fortress.
Can you repeat that again?</i>

33:35.410 --> 33:37.900
We have your boat and your cargo.

33:37.980 --> 33:40.269
Check call signs. Confirm.

33:40.349 --> 33:43.538
Release all prisoners unharmed...

33:43.618 --> 33:46.301
...and you can have your boat back.

33:46.381 --> 33:50.246
This is Mason Scrim. To whom am I speaking?

33:51.126 --> 33:52.848
None of your concern.

33:52.928 --> 33:57.452
Release all the prisoners, and you
will have your precious cargo back...

33:57.532 --> 33:59.710
...or we will deep-six it.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.092
Now listen to me carefully.

34:03.572 --> 34:06.722
You will return the ship and the cargo...

34:06.802 --> 34:09.732
...belonging to the Warlord immediately...

34:09.812 --> 34:14.402
...or I will send our sharks
to destroy Korotoa.

34:14.583 --> 34:17.228
- Where?
- Korotoa.

34:17.619 --> 34:20.475
- Never heard of it.
- <i>I repeat...</i>

34:20.955 --> 34:26.348
...release the cargo and the ship,
or I will destroy Korotoa.

34:26.838 --> 34:28.617
Can he do that?

34:28.847 --> 34:32.099
You have five seconds to decide.

34:53.388 --> 34:55.255
I'm keeping this.

34:59.594 --> 35:02.751
The minisub will only hold two people.
I don't think your salvage suit can fit.

35:02.831 --> 35:05.186
What about your sonar rig?
What kind of space does it need?

35:05.266 --> 35:08.323
It works best on a boat. It could be
redesigned, but that will take time.

35:08.403 --> 35:10.459
- How much time?
- I'd have to source new parts.

35:10.539 --> 35:12.294
Two, maybe 3 days for it to work in your sub.

35:12.374 --> 35:14.830
Then I'll have to teach you how
to use it, and that will take time.

35:14.910 --> 35:18.980
We don't have three days. There's no
guarantee our people will still be alive.

35:43.738 --> 35:46.528
What do you think, Edgar?
Can you mount your sonar device on this?

35:46.608 --> 35:49.598
- Well, it's...
- <i>This is Korotoa to Timor. Come in.</i>

35:49.678 --> 35:53.434
- Go ahead.
- Timor, what have you done?

35:53.514 --> 35:56.014
You need to return those items you stole.

35:56.384 --> 36:00.389
Listen. The Warlord is threatening
to kill all the hostages...

36:00.469 --> 36:04.545
...unless you return the cargo
you stole from them immediately.

36:04.625 --> 36:06.926
We returned that cargo.

36:07.006 --> 36:12.154
That's not what they're telling me.
You better do something and now.

36:12.734 --> 36:14.535
<i>Give me one minute.</i>

36:15.270 --> 36:16.892
You did what?

36:17.172 --> 36:19.261
- We kept their stuff.
- Why?

36:19.341 --> 36:22.954
We're thieves by trade. Also, you're
gonna need that stuff as leverage.

36:23.034 --> 36:25.667
They are going to kill the hostages!

36:25.747 --> 36:27.252
They're bluffing.

36:27.332 --> 36:31.206
You didn't see what they did on Korotoa!
They have an army of sharks!

36:31.286 --> 36:34.326
If what you said is true,
when they get this stuff back...

36:34.406 --> 36:36.811
...they will no longer need the hostages.

36:36.891 --> 36:39.510
This cargo will make the machine
run without humans.

36:39.590 --> 36:43.986
- What will they need the people for then?
- We are in charge of this operation.

36:44.066 --> 36:45.860
We hired you.

36:45.940 --> 36:50.511
- You are gambling with our people's lives.
- No! We're saving them.

36:50.591 --> 36:53.979
I'm sure that was your motive.
You need to bring this cargo back right now!

36:54.059 --> 36:56.531
- It's too late.
- What?

36:56.611 --> 36:58.700
To give the stuff back, it's too late.

36:58.780 --> 37:02.540
The mistakes you are making... will cost you.

37:03.752 --> 37:06.371
Mr. Scrim, sir...

37:07.021 --> 37:09.845
...I didn't know the cargo was removed.
This was not my intention.

37:09.925 --> 37:15.517
This is some kind of fubar snafu
that we are rectifying right now.

37:15.597 --> 37:18.420
Release the cargo...

37:19.000 --> 37:22.636
...or the captives will die.

37:23.905 --> 37:27.576
Don't do anything.
I'm getting your cargo back.

37:27.656 --> 37:31.083
- This wasn't me.
- It's... it's too late.

37:31.163 --> 37:34.246
- What are you talking about?
- Boom. Boom!

37:34.326 --> 37:36.871
I put explosives on the boat, man.

37:36.951 --> 37:41.319
That's what we're trying to do, right, guys,
I mean, overthrow the Warlord?

37:41.623 --> 37:46.678
Look, you told me if an opportunity
presented itself, and I took initiative.

37:48.597 --> 37:51.453
You need to get your people off the boat now!

37:52.000 --> 37:53.795
- 5, 4...
- Move!

37:53.875 --> 37:57.370
- Move! Get out!
- ...3, 2, 1.

37:57.450 --> 37:59.092
Boom!

38:06.781 --> 38:08.648
You're dead.

38:09.234 --> 38:11.237
You're all dead.

38:14.622 --> 38:19.309
Stand by for a message
from the Warlord Ian Fien!

38:21.109 --> 38:24.319
People of Korotoa, you've chosen to defy me.

38:25.749 --> 38:28.218
<i>Now you must pay the consequences.</i>

38:29.004 --> 38:31.660
The ocean is my dominion...

38:32.740 --> 38:35.264
<i>...and now I shall use it...</i>

38:35.840 --> 38:38.813
...to smite my enemies.

39:43.621 --> 39:45.654
Who's your Daddy?

40:03.030 --> 40:04.564
Him.

40:28.009 --> 40:30.037
What's wrong with the system?

40:34.915 --> 40:39.007
- How do we get back online?
- Well, the connections are all good.

40:39.087 --> 40:41.488
Something else is affecting the sharks.

40:43.123 --> 40:45.096
Oh, take him out.

40:45.176 --> 40:47.055
Bring him in.

40:51.165 --> 40:53.032
Take her.

41:16.490 --> 41:18.897
This was given to me by my father.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.384
Now I'm giving it to you.

41:22.364 --> 41:26.399
Take care of it and it will take care
of you and your people.

41:27.402 --> 41:30.269
<i>When you think of me,
I'll always be with you.</i>

41:39.013 --> 41:42.249
- Is the system working?
- Everything is a go.

41:49.324 --> 41:51.190
It's her.

41:52.627 --> 41:54.061
Bring her out!

42:05.706 --> 42:10.344
Somehow you're interfering
with this, aren't you?

42:17.304 --> 42:19.250
- Take her away.
- <i>No!</i>

42:19.330 --> 42:22.142
- Willow?
- Timor?

42:22.222 --> 42:25.091
- Willow!
- Timor!

42:27.595 --> 42:31.654
Listen. I want you to bring back
all that was taken...

42:32.534 --> 42:34.774
<i>...or all your people will die.</i>

42:35.556 --> 42:39.514
- I will.
- I want you to meet Scrim...

42:39.594 --> 42:43.566
...at Nauru in one hour,
and if you want your people to live...

42:43.646 --> 42:46.647
<i>...make sure all the cargo is intact.</i>

42:50.151 --> 42:55.625
I need everything back
that you stole right now.

43:01.696 --> 43:03.285
Hawksbill...

43:03.542 --> 43:08.356
...your cargo will be at Nauru docks
with the harbor master.

43:09.036 --> 43:10.838
Everything will be there.

43:13.441 --> 43:15.508
Is this everything?

43:16.577 --> 43:18.459
That's it, then.

43:18.539 --> 43:21.951
Any agreement or contract we've had...

43:22.413 --> 43:24.216
...is dissolved.

43:30.258 --> 43:32.459
Sion, let's go.

43:36.764 --> 43:38.930
We're still with you if you want.

43:39.500 --> 43:43.192
With what? There's nothing to be with.

43:44.272 --> 43:47.228
We're giving up. Sion and I
are going back to Korotoa.

43:47.308 --> 43:51.733
This whole thing was a mistake.

43:52.213 --> 43:54.035
No, it wasn't.

43:54.315 --> 43:56.571
I heard what they did over the radio.

43:56.651 --> 44:00.225
Exactly. So you know why we have to go!

44:00.305 --> 44:03.139
An hour ago, I would have agreed with you.

44:03.777 --> 44:05.398
Not now.

44:05.593 --> 44:07.041
Fine.

44:07.121 --> 44:10.575
You have your little crusade
against the Warlord.

44:10.655 --> 44:12.254
Leave us out of it.

44:12.334 --> 44:15.113
Listen, you know when they get these parts...

44:15.193 --> 44:18.660
...they'll have no reason
to keep the hostages alive.

44:18.740 --> 44:21.095
They will use them for shark food.

44:21.175 --> 44:24.933
They will be able to make
fresh water without human labor.

44:25.013 --> 44:27.435
What use will you be of to them?

44:27.965 --> 44:31.573
We have this one window now
to rescue your people.

44:32.153 --> 44:34.176
And once that is done?

44:35.356 --> 44:37.188
If we succeed...

44:38.691 --> 44:40.553
...what then?

44:42.029 --> 44:45.454
We fight, all of us!

44:46.234 --> 44:50.091
We made the mistake of letting
the Warlord grow powerful.

44:50.371 --> 44:54.996
We allowed this menace to grow while
everyone sat around and did nothing.

44:55.576 --> 44:59.636
He couldn't have grown so powerful
without everyone turning a blind eye.

45:00.815 --> 45:03.997
We have to get him now...

45:04.077 --> 45:06.440
...while we still can!

45:06.520 --> 45:09.256
Listen to them. They're right.

45:13.794 --> 45:15.295
Okay.

45:16.764 --> 45:20.789
If I agree to this, no more lone-wolf stuff.

45:21.769 --> 45:23.391
We're a team.

45:23.571 --> 45:25.581
We do this together...

45:26.061 --> 45:27.929
...or not at all.

45:28.309 --> 45:31.124
Nobody blows up anything...

45:31.204 --> 45:33.134
...without my say-so.

45:33.214 --> 45:35.940
No hidden explosives. No stealing.

45:36.950 --> 45:38.818
Can we do that?

46:07.315 --> 46:11.372
We are 24 nautical miles southwest.

46:11.452 --> 46:15.176
I'm currently pinging at 2,576 fathoms...

46:15.256 --> 46:17.736
...and that sounds...

46:17.816 --> 46:20.672
...like a Xinjiang tropical coelacanth.

46:36.630 --> 46:38.211
Nice.

46:50.258 --> 46:55.716
We confiscate anything from the Warlord,
we split it after fuel and expenses.

47:13.431 --> 47:16.117
Oi, Warlord wants to see her.

47:18.520 --> 47:20.054
Now!

47:21.156 --> 47:23.412
But if you don't want to talk...

47:23.492 --> 47:25.409
...that's not gonna help anybody.

47:28.129 --> 47:30.218
Now, you're from Korotoa, right?

47:30.298 --> 47:33.935
But that is not your original clan, is it?

47:36.902 --> 47:39.495
The world was hit with the flood
not long before your time.

47:39.575 --> 47:43.342
People were scrambling
to get onshore of mountaintops...

47:43.422 --> 47:46.102
...that you could still see
above the sea line.

47:46.182 --> 47:49.271
The masters of the mountains pushed
the people back into the sea.

47:49.351 --> 47:52.841
Battles were bloody,
and the blood drew the sharks.

47:52.921 --> 47:55.878
I was trapped in a group
of thousands of people...

47:55.958 --> 47:58.814
...and we were scrambling, trying
to get on that last piece of land...

47:58.894 --> 48:03.285
...but it was already occupied,
and we were pushed back into the water...

48:03.365 --> 48:08.384
...and the water was filled with sharks,
and it was a massacre.

48:08.464 --> 48:09.998
But...

48:10.577 --> 48:14.630
...there was... there was one man
who did something amazing...

48:14.710 --> 48:18.968
...one man who crawled above.

48:19.048 --> 48:21.470
And then with some power he had...

48:21.550 --> 48:23.896
...some source of energy...

48:23.976 --> 48:27.043
...he was able to turn the sharks back.

48:27.823 --> 48:32.114
A few of us, a small group,
were able to survive.

48:32.594 --> 48:36.252
It didn't mean anything, because when
the sea calmed and we looked around...

48:36.332 --> 48:39.200
...everything had gone underwater.

48:41.469 --> 48:43.292
I never forgot this man.

48:43.372 --> 48:47.426
It was his ability that...
that inspired me to create...

48:47.506 --> 48:50.599
...my system of dominion over the sharks...

48:50.779 --> 48:54.615
...a system that I believed
was unique to the world...

48:56.578 --> 48:58.356
...until today.

48:59.921 --> 49:03.449
How do you do it? How do you stop the sharks?

49:03.529 --> 49:05.859
I didn't do anything.

49:09.197 --> 49:11.266
So how does it work?

49:12.968 --> 49:15.737
It's nothing, it's only a keepsake.

49:16.437 --> 49:17.953
Don't!

49:21.276 --> 49:22.497
Okay.

49:25.014 --> 49:28.104
If you share your information with me...

49:29.054 --> 49:30.918
...the world is yours.

49:44.166 --> 49:46.255
Tell me how it works...

49:46.735 --> 49:50.292
...or I will send my sharks to Korotoa,
and they will destroy that settlement...

49:50.372 --> 49:53.240
...and every living person in it.

50:00.048 --> 50:03.566
Scrim, once you pick up the cargo,
I want you to head to Korotoa...

50:03.646 --> 50:05.711
...and wait for my orders.

50:06.154 --> 50:08.844
- Please don't do it.
- You can do it! It's easy!

50:08.924 --> 50:11.080
- I can't.
- All you have to do...

50:11.160 --> 50:13.415
...is give me what I want.

50:13.495 --> 50:15.329
I can't.

50:19.201 --> 50:22.825
My assistant just came up
with an excellent idea.

50:22.905 --> 50:26.708
If we cannot get it from you directly...

50:29.294 --> 50:31.562
...we can get it indirectly.

50:35.433 --> 50:38.491
I'd like you to meet my favorite guest here.

50:39.121 --> 50:42.277
Tiger shark. It's amazing what they can eat.

50:42.357 --> 50:44.980
They've found things
like license plate, a reindeer...

50:45.060 --> 50:48.917
...suit of armor in their stomach, so
I'm sure she'll have no trouble with you.

50:50.399 --> 50:52.421
You know what I also heard?

50:52.801 --> 50:54.669
That she's hungry.

51:14.089 --> 51:17.546
It works at close proximity.

51:18.276 --> 51:21.962
Now we just need to find out
if it works at a distance.

51:29.838 --> 51:31.861
Take her off the float!

51:31.941 --> 51:33.774
Bring her up here!

51:37.346 --> 51:40.798
- <i>I'm in position.</i>
- Wait for my command.

51:46.288 --> 51:48.122
Bring her here.

51:50.859 --> 51:53.349
We're standing by on your command.

51:54.059 --> 51:58.167
If you want to save your people,
you're going to have to do more.

51:58.247 --> 52:00.088
Now's your chance.

52:00.168 --> 52:01.680
Sir...

52:02.128 --> 52:04.778
...I may have a way to uncover her method.

52:04.858 --> 52:06.128
What is it?

52:06.208 --> 52:09.218
If she won't freely divulge
the information we need...

52:09.298 --> 52:12.620
...there are ways to get it out of her.
See, all I need is, uh...

52:12.700 --> 52:16.672
...to record her brain waves
while she's interacting with the sharks.

52:16.752 --> 52:20.028
Then we can look through the recordings,
and maybe I can decipher her method.

52:20.108 --> 52:22.044
You have my permission to do it.

52:22.124 --> 52:25.213
I mean, it's gonna take a minute.
In theory, it should be pretty simple...

52:25.293 --> 52:27.859
- ...but it's gonna take a minute...
- Just be quick about it.

52:27.939 --> 52:30.252
Without her knowledge, this thing is useless.

52:30.332 --> 52:32.726
What I want is more
than just how she did it...

52:32.806 --> 52:35.305
...but I want to know
what her capabilities are.

52:35.385 --> 52:40.841
We can see she could be defensive,
but can she also attack?

52:44.446 --> 52:47.537
If you want to save your people...

52:49.017 --> 52:52.086
...you need to do more.

52:54.689 --> 52:58.180
<i>I'm not here to collect tribute.</i>

52:58.260 --> 53:01.847
<i>I am here under orders of Ian Fien.</i>

53:01.927 --> 53:07.088
On his command,
I will release our army of sharks...

53:07.168 --> 53:09.790
...who will destroy your city.

53:09.870 --> 53:12.107
<i>Now, this is a rightful...</i>

53:12.605 --> 53:16.331
<i>...action by the authority of Ian Fien...</i>

53:16.411 --> 53:20.569
as he does have dominion
of all those living on the water...

53:20.649 --> 53:23.471
...so nothing you can say or do...

53:23.900 --> 53:25.775
...will stop me.

53:27.689 --> 53:29.137
<i>Prepare to die.</i>

53:29.457 --> 53:33.300
If you could just be patient for a moment.
I'm waiting for his command.

53:33.680 --> 53:35.562
<i>Thank you.</i>

53:56.418 --> 53:59.219
Willow, I'm going to give you a task.

54:00.605 --> 54:03.745
I'm going to ask you to have the sharks...

54:04.675 --> 54:06.544
...attack a target...

54:08.430 --> 54:10.269
...this target.

54:14.202 --> 54:18.043
Now, if you want to save
your people, you'll do it!

54:18.273 --> 54:20.521
Please, don't make me do this.

54:29.684 --> 54:31.512
Do it.

54:37.292 --> 54:40.348
Scrim, on my command...

54:40.828 --> 54:43.464
...I want you to take them out.

54:57.512 --> 54:59.037
<i>10...</i>

55:00.415 --> 55:01.982
<i>...9...</i>

55:04.085 --> 55:05.619
...8...

55:06.521 --> 55:08.693
- ...7...
- Do it!

55:08.773 --> 55:10.812
If it'll save them, do it!

55:10.892 --> 55:12.426
...6...

55:13.762 --> 55:15.329
...5...

55:16.031 --> 55:17.469
...4...

55:18.599 --> 55:20.055
- ...3...
- I can't!

55:20.135 --> 55:22.758
You have to! My life doesn't matter!

55:22.838 --> 55:25.873
Do it! Save them!

55:27.509 --> 55:29.054
...2...

55:30.612 --> 55:32.146
...1...

55:37.299 --> 55:41.368
Scrim, stop the attack!
Return to Hawksbill now!

55:43.471 --> 55:45.634
All hands on deck! We're coming about!

55:45.714 --> 55:48.397
Sir, I need more time to capture the data.
We're getting somewhere.

55:48.477 --> 55:51.433
A few more sessions and I'll have enough
information to decipher her method.

55:51.513 --> 55:55.104
We'll have time for that later.
Right now, I have to deal with the intruder.

55:55.184 --> 55:57.238
What about the prisoners?

55:57.618 --> 56:01.421
Put them back in their cells,
and bring her pendant to me.

56:08.296 --> 56:11.085
How close do we have to be
for your system to work?

56:11.165 --> 56:12.922
Closer than this.

56:13.002 --> 56:16.424
We get too close,
we'll be in range of their catapult.

56:16.504 --> 56:19.427
- Did you say catapult?
- Catapult?

56:19.507 --> 56:21.896
Medieval fort device
that utilizes two elastic bands...

56:21.976 --> 56:23.899
Yeah, yeah, Caesar.
I know what a catapult is!

56:23.979 --> 56:26.935
- I thought you'd been here before.
- We were in the submersible.

56:27.015 --> 56:31.172
Got at least one catapult.
Takes about a minute to reload.

56:31.252 --> 56:34.810
They don't have unlimited ammo, but if
we take a direct hit, we're going down...

56:34.890 --> 56:37.631
...so we gotta stay out of range.

56:49.077 --> 56:51.563
If you're gonna do something,
you better do it now.

56:51.873 --> 56:56.490
I don't have the amulet. Even if I did know
how to use it, I don't have it anymore.

56:58.933 --> 57:00.969
You have to try something.

57:01.649 --> 57:04.106
You were given that for a reason.

57:05.136 --> 57:09.945
I'm not a shark caller, but I don't think you
need to be near the amulet for it to work.

57:10.025 --> 57:13.893
You just need some kind
of connection, and it can work.

57:14.396 --> 57:16.430
You need to try.

57:27.899 --> 57:29.766
All right.

57:31.052 --> 57:33.320
Fire on my command.

57:36.174 --> 57:38.430
Don't think we can get closer than this.

57:38.510 --> 57:41.300
- I don't have a decent scan.
- What do you mean?

57:41.380 --> 57:43.202
We're too far out.

57:44.482 --> 57:47.089
You said they take a minute
to reload the catapult.

57:47.169 --> 57:51.514
I'll draw their fire. While they're
reloading, you gotta get in close.

57:51.594 --> 57:54.468
Otherwise, we have no idea
what the layout of the fortress is.

58:23.955 --> 58:25.972
Take him out now!

58:54.869 --> 58:56.703
Reload!

59:10.685 --> 59:13.175
We got about 30 seconds,
and then we have to get out!

59:13.255 --> 59:17.858
- We need to get closer.
- I'll do what I can, but this better work!

59:18.680 --> 59:22.186
- This is not an exact science.
- What do you mean, not exact science?

59:22.266 --> 59:23.585
Calibrate yourself.

59:23.665 --> 59:25.687
How 'bout you calibrate
that machine of yours?

59:25.767 --> 59:27.834
<i>Silence, s'il vous plait!</i>

59:42.484 --> 59:44.485
Take out that vessel!

59:59.901 --> 01:00:03.570
- Hey, you got it?
- No! We need to get closer!

01:00:30.682 --> 01:00:33.184
We have to get out of here! Now!

01:00:33.784 --> 01:00:36.194
We can't stay here any longer!
Have you got it?

01:00:36.274 --> 01:00:39.923
- No! Nearly there!
- Come on, man!

01:00:42.294 --> 01:00:44.158
Got it!

01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:46.266
Okay.

01:00:48.066 --> 01:00:49.400
Okay.

01:01:03.515 --> 01:01:06.917
Hold on. This is gonna be close!

01:01:49.424 --> 01:01:51.496
- Get the ladder!
- Drop the ladder!

01:01:51.576 --> 01:01:54.598
- Open the gate!
- Okay, check.

01:01:59.984 --> 01:02:01.873
Get Timor!

01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:04.977
Take my hand! Take my hand!

01:02:18.703 --> 01:02:20.759
Get Timor!

01:02:20.839 --> 01:02:23.128
Nimue, get Timor!

01:02:23.628 --> 01:02:26.173
Timor! Hold on!

01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:51.805
We still have to go through with the plan.

01:02:56.644 --> 01:02:58.845
I have a pretty good view here.

01:02:59.674 --> 01:03:03.675
I'm not certain, but this looks like
a place where the prisoners are kept.

01:03:05.153 --> 01:03:06.821
What about a way in?

01:03:06.901 --> 01:03:10.111
This is where the sharks come in.
It's a portal.

01:03:10.191 --> 01:03:12.430
There's not a good place to enter.

01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:15.133
Is there any other option?

01:03:15.213 --> 01:03:19.316
Unless they walk you through
in the front door... no.

01:03:21.986 --> 01:03:24.053
Then that's the way I go.

01:03:25.506 --> 01:03:27.028
You?

01:03:27.558 --> 01:03:29.448
Toby's gone.

01:03:30.228 --> 01:03:32.096
I'm getting Willow out.

01:03:37.969 --> 01:03:40.859
They're too far out. Halt the trebuchet.

01:03:41.239 --> 01:03:43.462
Think you can get away from me?

01:03:43.542 --> 01:03:45.964
I've got something else for you.

01:03:48.746 --> 01:03:52.154
I have a task for you.
I want you to prepare...

01:03:53.234 --> 01:03:55.139
...the Kamikaze Shark.

01:03:55.219 --> 01:03:57.876
- Yes, sir.
- Hah!

01:03:59.256 --> 01:04:01.596
This thing isn't exactly sharkproof.

01:04:01.676 --> 01:04:04.599
- I'll have to be fast.
- This is suicide.

01:04:05.579 --> 01:04:07.585
You got any better ideas?

01:04:08.683 --> 01:04:10.572
Didn't think so.

01:04:11.352 --> 01:04:15.610
We've come this far. I'm not
giving up now. We have to get in there.

01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:18.872
- What are you gonna do when you get inside?
- Might have a Mai Tai.

01:04:20.428 --> 01:04:24.352
I'm taking the whole place down,
starting with the power.

01:04:24.432 --> 01:04:26.254
Trust me.

01:04:26.584 --> 01:04:28.415
They won't know what hit 'em.

01:04:42.917 --> 01:04:44.739
I'm going with you.

01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:46.975
How will you get back?

01:04:47.755 --> 01:04:49.789
Let me worry about that.

01:06:29.356 --> 01:06:30.924
Timor.

01:06:59.955 --> 01:07:02.356
You can do it. Come on.

01:07:07.337 --> 01:07:08.859
Come on.

01:07:56.231 --> 01:07:58.651
- Something is coming our way.
- What is it?

01:07:59.001 --> 01:08:01.491
I shouldn't be able to detect
sharks on the sonar...

01:08:01.571 --> 01:08:03.786
...because they don't have air bladders.

01:08:04.874 --> 01:08:08.097
It's definitely a shark, but it's peculiar...

01:08:08.177 --> 01:08:10.233
...and it's moving towards us.

01:08:10.313 --> 01:08:13.714
Sion. Sion, take the wheel!

01:08:39.808 --> 01:08:42.765
Everyone, abandon ship!

01:08:42.845 --> 01:08:44.645
Abandon ship!

01:08:55.023 --> 01:08:56.823
Nearly on target.

01:09:35.581 --> 01:09:38.182
No! No!

01:10:42.418 --> 01:10:43.941
Sir.

01:10:47.355 --> 01:10:49.223
She's doing something.

01:11:00.736 --> 01:11:04.338
Just hold on. Hold on. Okay. Okay.

01:11:22.124 --> 01:11:23.925
We can make it.

01:11:28.063 --> 01:11:29.864
Bring 'em all to me.

01:12:53.449 --> 01:12:55.382
It's working!

01:13:17.473 --> 01:13:19.874
I'm getting lots of data here.

01:13:20.393 --> 01:13:22.256
This is amazing.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.844
It's beautiful.

01:14:47.981 --> 01:14:51.382
There's only room
for one of us in this world.

01:15:49.924 --> 01:15:51.458
Willow?

01:15:55.064 --> 01:15:57.235
Timor, behind you!

01:16:24.826 --> 01:16:26.393
Uh-oh.

01:16:29.431 --> 01:16:33.066
I'm gonna saw your head off.

01:17:00.462 --> 01:17:02.029
Hi.

01:17:02.764 --> 01:17:04.286
Hi.

01:17:04.666 --> 01:17:07.713
I hate to break up
this little reunion, but...

01:17:07.793 --> 01:17:11.048
...would you like to get us out of here? Huh?

01:17:14.242 --> 01:17:16.549
We have to get our people out of here.
I emptied the ballast tanks.

01:17:16.629 --> 01:17:20.436
- The fortress is sinking.
- We'll... we'll commandeer their boat.

01:17:20.516 --> 01:17:22.871
- They owe me a new one.
- The prisoners are this way.

01:17:22.951 --> 01:17:24.518
Okay.

01:17:26.255 --> 01:17:28.322
This way, come on!

01:17:30.325 --> 01:17:31.858
Willow.

01:17:33.061 --> 01:17:34.936
Get them out!

01:17:59.454 --> 01:18:01.518
Are you doing this?

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:07.027
I don't know. I... I don't think
they're under anyone's control.

01:18:10.665 --> 01:18:14.122
Timor, what about the desalination machine?

01:18:14.202 --> 01:18:17.559
We should take the key components.
It's the one thing of value here.

01:18:17.639 --> 01:18:20.105
We'll secure Scrim's boat. You go help them.

01:18:20.185 --> 01:18:23.043
Okay. Okay. Come on, Sion. Come on.

01:19:01.549 --> 01:19:05.082
- Can you stop this?
- I don't know. There's so many.

01:19:06.922 --> 01:19:09.645
- You have to do something!
- I can't. He destroyed the amulet.

01:19:09.725 --> 01:19:12.548
- The source of my power is gone.
- That's not true.

01:19:12.628 --> 01:19:16.363
I don't even know how or what I did.
I... I can't do it!

01:19:17.566 --> 01:19:19.846
The power resides within you.

01:19:19.926 --> 01:19:22.691
The amulet resonated with your power.

01:19:22.771 --> 01:19:24.993
It was never the source.

01:19:25.073 --> 01:19:27.712
You are a shark caller.

01:19:27.792 --> 01:19:30.227
You must believe in yourself.

01:20:22.664 --> 01:20:24.215
Go.

01:20:46.153 --> 01:20:47.654
Go!

01:20:49.474 --> 01:20:51.293
Get her now!

01:22:54.865 --> 01:22:58.848
When you went out on your own,
many thought to banish you.

01:23:00.604 --> 01:23:04.621
We would have lost everything
if it wasn't for what you have done.

01:23:08.879 --> 01:23:11.481
Thank you. Thank you all.

01:23:13.674 --> 01:23:15.552
May the ocean embrace you.

01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:35.752
This belongs to the shark caller.

01:23:39.275 --> 01:23:41.733
It would have made your father proud.

01:23:43.113 --> 01:23:44.980
Thank you.

01:23:45.649 --> 01:23:48.506
Now your real training can begin...

01:23:48.586 --> 01:23:51.509
...if you are to follow
the path of the callers.

01:23:51.589 --> 01:23:54.445
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

01:23:55.053 --> 01:23:57.279
Now we begin.

01:24:32.756 --> 01:24:36.353
You know, you're gonna need to up your
skills if you want a chance with her now.

01:24:36.433 --> 01:24:38.419
Thanks for the encouragement.

01:24:38.499 --> 01:24:40.551
It's just an observation.

01:24:40.631 --> 01:24:43.037
I mean, what can you do?

01:24:43.467 --> 01:24:46.129
You may recall the, uh, legend...

01:24:46.209 --> 01:24:49.660
...of the fisherman who took on
the baddest Warlord in the ocean.

01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:53.130
- Heard that one before?
- Sounds like a tall tale to me.

01:24:54.912 --> 01:24:56.734
He didn't do it alone.

01:24:57.214 --> 01:24:59.015
He had a lot of help...

01:24:59.997 --> 01:25:01.484
...from his friends.
