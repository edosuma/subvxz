WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:11.563
- I need to know why.

00:18.639 --> 00:22.125
- There are so many things
no one has the answers for.

00:27.786 --> 00:28.925
- What does that mean?

00:30.720 --> 00:32.860
- Why we lose the
people we love.

00:34.379 --> 00:35.931
Death.

00:35.932 --> 00:37.071
Pain.

00:38.003 --> 00:39.003
Change.

00:40.350 --> 00:43.353
Sadly, it's all a part of life.

00:50.015 --> 00:51.153
You're trying to figure out

00:51.154 --> 00:54.157
if there's something you
could've done to stop this.

00:59.266 --> 01:01.129
We'll never know
why people elect

01:01.130 --> 01:03.063
to take away the
blessing of life.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.789
There's nothing you
could have done.

01:08.171 --> 01:09.931
We all have our time.

01:11.381 --> 01:15.075
Unfortunately, she decided to
make that decision on her own.

01:23.152 --> 01:24.152
- She left me.

01:29.813 --> 01:34.232
- Try to remember
her as she was:

01:35.647 --> 01:37.097
a loving mother,

01:38.891 --> 01:40.169
a human being.

01:44.587 --> 01:46.968
I will pray for her
soul, young man.

02:53.863 --> 02:55.658
- I'll take it from here, Fiona.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.685
- Something sad?

03:25.274 --> 03:26.654
- It's the saddest.

03:31.383 --> 03:33.213
- I am so sorry, honey.

03:38.079 --> 03:39.079
- No.

03:41.393 --> 03:42.670
It's beautiful.

03:51.955 --> 03:53.681
I think I may have
found somebody.

04:28.406 --> 04:30.511
- Is this the cheapest one?

04:32.306 --> 04:35.170
- I'm sorry, but this is
the least expensive casket

04:35.171 --> 04:36.171
that we have.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.486
- I think we're
gonna have to go to

04:40.487 --> 04:42.696
the cremation services
down the mountain.

04:43.524 --> 04:47.770
A casket and burial is
out of our price range.

04:49.496 --> 04:53.120
- So, you mother grew
up around here, right?

05:10.482 --> 05:11.793
Excuse me.

05:11.794 --> 05:15.418
Why don't I speak with my
associate and see what we can do.

05:19.249 --> 05:20.423
- That's him, isn't it?

05:21.493 --> 05:23.770
- That's the one
whose mother...?

05:23.771 --> 05:24.771
- Yes.

05:31.710 --> 05:33.159
- Then that's him.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.574
- He's cute.

05:34.575 --> 05:35.473
I'll see what I can do

05:35.474 --> 05:37.406
about having him come
over for dinner.

05:39.097 --> 05:40.788
That is, if you're sure.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.349
Excuse me.

05:55.182 --> 05:56.701
Why don't we go with this one?

05:58.012 --> 05:59.012
- I'm sorry.

06:00.325 --> 06:01.325
What?

06:02.396 --> 06:06.676
- Providing for a loved one's
death can be very hard,

06:07.608 --> 06:09.747
especially when it
comes up so suddenly

06:09.748 --> 06:11.093
and you're all alone,

06:11.094 --> 06:14.787
so why don't we just write
off the whole thing

06:14.788 --> 06:17.687
to a small local discount.

06:23.590 --> 06:26.039
- Thank you, but
that's too much.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.007
- Nonsense.

06:28.008 --> 06:29.940
- You imagine that you
lived around here.

06:29.941 --> 06:32.943
I mean, well, you're
just practically family.

06:32.944 --> 06:34.427
- I couldn't.

06:34.428 --> 06:35.428
- You can.

06:40.261 --> 06:42.573
- What I meant to say

06:42.574 --> 06:47.129
was that I couldn't accept
such a generous offer

06:47.130 --> 06:49.788
without giving you
something in return.

06:50.824 --> 06:51.824
- Dinner then.

06:52.791 --> 06:55.068
Why don't you come
and have dinner

06:55.069 --> 06:58.107
with myself and my family.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.178
- Thank you, but...

07:01.179 --> 07:03.318
- Oh, no-no-no, no buts.

07:03.319 --> 07:04.734
You shouldn't be alone.

07:08.013 --> 07:09.462
- Thank you.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.568
- You're very welcome.

07:32.728 --> 07:36.214
His mother dying and practically
dropping on our doorstep

07:37.111 --> 07:38.699
is just too perfect.

07:42.323 --> 07:43.393
- It's a tragedy.

07:44.774 --> 07:46.326
- Of course.

07:46.327 --> 07:49.261
But even tragedy has its
happy coincidences.

07:51.367 --> 07:54.059
- Yeah, I guess so.

08:28.266 --> 08:29.370
- What are you doing?

08:32.097 --> 08:33.097
- Trying to help.

08:35.283 --> 08:36.962
You know your mother
would've looked pretty

08:36.964 --> 08:39.034
in a burlap sack.

08:44.731 --> 08:47.491
I found some jewelry your
mother borrowed from me

08:47.492 --> 08:49.562
before you were born.

08:49.563 --> 08:50.737
- Aunt Jenny, please.

08:53.636 --> 08:55.880
- I didn't come here
to take it, Brandon.

08:58.779 --> 09:00.022
- Why did you come here?

09:02.645 --> 09:04.508
- Because we're family.

09:04.509 --> 09:06.097
That's what family does.

09:08.478 --> 09:10.997
Your mother chose
to push us away.

09:10.998 --> 09:12.552
That doesn't mean you have to.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.729
- You're the only one who
came to the funeral.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.111
The only one who cared to.

09:23.217 --> 09:25.047
Who would choose a
family like that?

09:31.709 --> 09:35.298
- Did anyone ever tell you you
look just like your father?

09:38.370 --> 09:39.370
- No.

09:40.476 --> 09:41.650
- Well, you do.

09:44.066 --> 09:45.757
The rest is pure Eleanor.

10:17.375 --> 10:18.514
- You're looking fair.

10:30.768 --> 10:32.424
- Did you ever love Lassiter?

10:37.844 --> 10:38.844
- Maybe.

10:41.710 --> 10:45.713
Sometimes I think we loved
the song or the gift

10:45.714 --> 10:47.854
more than we ever
did each other.

10:51.858 --> 10:52.962
- I never noticed.

10:54.481 --> 10:57.691
Or I guess I chose not to.

11:02.869 --> 11:04.525
- Not like you and John.

11:09.841 --> 11:12.326
- And still John
threw the song away.

11:14.294 --> 11:15.640
- He has, but not you.

11:19.057 --> 11:20.093
- Didn't he?

11:23.096 --> 11:26.374
- True love, even with
time on our side,

11:26.375 --> 11:28.101
is always an uphill battle.

11:31.621 --> 11:36.557
Some of us are born to love,
and some of us maybe not.

11:42.425 --> 11:43.703
- Why did you do it, Kat?

11:47.223 --> 11:48.846
Sing the song with Lassiter?

11:57.061 --> 11:58.061
- For you.

11:59.880 --> 12:00.960
- I never would've asked...

12:00.961 --> 12:05.725
- No, I'm happiest
watching you in love,

12:06.726 --> 12:09.210
first with John and now.

12:09.211 --> 12:11.869
Really, I'm happiest
being a spectator.

12:15.286 --> 12:16.286
Hey.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.669
I was never meant
to be with a man.

12:25.883 --> 12:27.816
They're way too fragile.

12:31.060 --> 12:36.065
Fiona, really, I'm happy
being here for you.

13:04.404 --> 13:05.956
Oh, Fiona!

13:05.957 --> 13:08.339
Hold on, let me look at you.

13:11.169 --> 13:12.169
Oh.

13:12.964 --> 13:15.379
Something, something,
we need something.

13:15.380 --> 13:16.380
Oh.

13:19.108 --> 13:20.489
This will work.

13:23.354 --> 13:25.805
Okay, last touch.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.756
- Hi, I'm Fiona.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.831
- Brandon.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.041
- It's nice to
meet you, Brandon.

13:56.111 --> 13:58.941
And you brought wine, how sweet.

13:59.804 --> 14:02.081
- Yeah, you know, I just figured

14:02.082 --> 14:04.222
I should bring something
to the table.

14:06.535 --> 14:09.158
- Oh, thank you, but you've
already brought plenty.

14:15.095 --> 14:17.096
And I should let
you in my house.

14:17.097 --> 14:17.995
Where are my manners?

14:17.996 --> 14:19.133
I'm so sorry.

14:19.134 --> 14:20.306
Please, come in.

14:20.307 --> 14:21.170
- It's fine.

14:21.171 --> 14:22.723
It's totally fine.

14:38.879 --> 14:39.879
- Katarina's my sister.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.984
She's the one who
sold you the coffin.

14:44.918 --> 14:48.300
- I don't know if sold
is the right word.

14:48.301 --> 14:50.750
- You you know what I mean.

14:50.751 --> 14:53.030
She showed it to you.

14:55.549 --> 14:57.413
- I know, that was a joke.

14:58.345 --> 15:00.658
- Oh.

15:03.143 --> 15:07.078
We just, we try to
help out when we can.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.770
The funeral business is kinda
more of a family tradition

15:10.771 --> 15:13.291
than a trade, if that
makes any sense.

15:17.917 --> 15:22.955
- My mom and I used to go out
every Tuesday with the church

15:22.956 --> 15:25.545
to hand out sandwiches
to the homeless.

15:28.375 --> 15:32.034
You could call that family
tradition of sorts.

15:33.035 --> 15:34.794
- Oh, so you go to church?

15:34.795 --> 15:38.972
- No, no, not me,
but my mom did.

15:40.732 --> 15:43.425
Weird thing about tradition.

15:45.427 --> 15:46.427
- Yeah.

15:51.053 --> 15:52.537
We should probably get going.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.988
- Yeah, lead the way.

16:01.063 --> 16:02.444
Holy shit, okay.

16:04.204 --> 16:05.204
Lead the way.

16:11.488 --> 16:12.488
- How about some more?

16:12.489 --> 16:14.386
- Oh no, I had better not.

16:14.387 --> 16:16.067
Should probably get
something in my stomach

16:16.091 --> 16:17.803
before I go embarrassing myself.

16:17.804 --> 16:21.359
- Oh, a man of
moderation, how quaint.

16:22.636 --> 16:24.604
- A man of caution at best.

16:25.812 --> 16:28.642
- Then we better get the main
course out here posthaste.

16:30.644 --> 16:35.684
Lassiter!

16:36.512 --> 16:37.512
- The groundsman?

16:38.790 --> 16:40.550
- And my husband.

16:40.551 --> 16:42.794
Not known for the
spring in his step.

16:47.144 --> 16:48.766
Ah, not a moment too soon, dear.

16:52.908 --> 16:54.771
- Don't let the state of
the grounds fool you,

16:54.772 --> 16:57.326
Lassiter is actually
a very good cook.

17:00.847 --> 17:02.192
- If looks are
anything to go by,

17:02.193 --> 17:04.022
I'm sure you're
right about that.

17:07.095 --> 17:09.890
- Oh, you've outdone
yourself, dear.

17:22.281 --> 17:23.281
Thank you.

18:02.634 --> 18:03.634
- Thank you.

18:03.635 --> 18:04.669
- Of course.

18:22.791 --> 18:23.791
- Good?

18:26.139 --> 18:28.865
- Delicious, thank you.

18:28.866 --> 18:31.110
- We usually like to say
grace before we eat.

18:33.422 --> 18:34.871
- Stop it, Lassiter!

18:34.872 --> 18:36.356
Brandon is our guest.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.394
- No, it's my fault.

18:40.395 --> 18:41.395
I shoulda waited.

18:42.260 --> 18:43.260
Sorry.

18:43.261 --> 18:44.294
- No, it's okay.

18:44.295 --> 18:46.711
Honestly, I never wait either.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.151
- I love furniture like this.

19:14.325 --> 19:15.325
Hand-carved.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.156
Cared for.

19:19.779 --> 19:21.124
Meant to stand on its own

19:21.125 --> 19:23.576
against the fine
china it's holding.

19:26.199 --> 19:30.410
Furniture today is so
painfully pragmatic

19:32.516 --> 19:35.967
and built to sell, to get by.

19:37.831 --> 19:42.871
But furniture like this, it's
meant for something more.

19:45.632 --> 19:46.632
It's timeless.

19:50.568 --> 19:51.673
- How profound.

19:52.536 --> 19:56.195
- Oh, no.

19:57.748 --> 19:59.059
Simple observation.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.961
- Are you an artist?

20:04.962 --> 20:06.032
- A musician.

20:08.172 --> 20:10.035
My mother made me
play when I was a boy

20:10.036 --> 20:12.349
and she never stopped making me.

20:13.384 --> 20:16.144
- Aw, that is so sweet.

20:16.145 --> 20:18.181
Did you get your
artistry from her?

20:18.182 --> 20:19.182
- No.

20:27.605 --> 20:28.605
- I'm sorry?

20:30.539 --> 20:33.438
- Well, you didn't get
it from your mother.

20:33.439 --> 20:34.991
Well, what I mean is

20:34.992 --> 20:36.855
when I was working on
her for the funeral,

20:36.856 --> 20:40.168
I just didn't get the impression
that she was artistic.

20:40.169 --> 20:43.241
There were no paint traces
underneath her fingernails

20:43.242 --> 20:47.175
or no calluses on her palms
and no scars or wounds

20:47.176 --> 20:50.283
to indicate any past
or present labor.

20:51.491 --> 20:53.320
I just didn't get the feeling

20:53.321 --> 20:56.531
that her hands were
altogether very artistic.

21:07.093 --> 21:08.094
- She sang.

21:12.581 --> 21:16.653
Never in public,
but always to me

21:16.654 --> 21:18.449
and when she thought
she was alone.

21:21.521 --> 21:24.006
She had a beautiful voice.

22:11.364 --> 22:14.643
- That is absolutely
lovely, Fiona.

22:35.871 --> 22:37.425
- That was some dinner.

22:40.013 --> 22:42.049
- Yeah, I wouldn't
mind Lassiter.

22:42.050 --> 22:43.153
See enough dead bodies

22:43.154 --> 22:45.260
and you're bound to
loosen a bolt or two.

22:55.097 --> 22:56.823
Are you gonna be
at work tomorrow?

22:58.584 --> 23:00.448
- No, no work tomorrow.

23:02.139 --> 23:03.139
I...

23:04.762 --> 23:07.143
have to go by my mother's house

23:07.144 --> 23:08.662
and sign some
papers for the bank

23:08.663 --> 23:10.630
before they can start
the estate sale.

23:12.529 --> 23:14.220
Turn over the keys and whatnot.

23:17.706 --> 23:18.706
- That's awful.

23:21.538 --> 23:23.850
You must have so
many memories there.

23:31.340 --> 23:33.757
- Yeah, all of 'em, actually.

23:34.999 --> 23:38.417
Been there since I left
the hospital, day one.

23:43.801 --> 23:45.872
- Have you had any
help through all this?

23:48.565 --> 23:49.565
- A little.

23:51.464 --> 23:54.017
I have some extended family
I've never really known

23:54.018 --> 23:58.609
and they sent an aunt of
mine out to play diplomat.

24:01.543 --> 24:02.543
She tried.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.443
But...

24:07.963 --> 24:09.931
I'd really rather
handle it on my own.

24:14.073 --> 24:15.454
- Could you take something?

24:16.696 --> 24:18.767
Something to remember her by?

24:25.809 --> 24:27.809
- Yeah, I'm still in the
house for a few more days,

24:27.833 --> 24:32.804
but I've never really been
the sentimental type.

24:35.094 --> 24:36.819
Taking a piece outta the house

24:36.820 --> 24:41.618
would be like taking a piece of
her without the whole thing.

24:48.901 --> 24:53.802
- You'd be surprised how much
you can forget over time.

24:57.806 --> 24:59.946
A memento might not
be a bad idea,

25:01.707 --> 25:04.744
but I'm sure you'll find your
own way to remember her by.

25:14.547 --> 25:15.859
- You're very kind, Fiona.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.759
Your whole family.

25:21.278 --> 25:24.868
Even if Lassiter hates
me and my agnostic ways.

25:27.491 --> 25:30.976
- Well, I guess he'll just have
to get over those, won't he?

25:30.977 --> 25:33.635
- I hope I'm not around
enough to find out.

25:36.189 --> 25:37.189
- Oh.

25:39.917 --> 25:44.507
- I mean, I just meant this
being a funeral home and all.

25:44.508 --> 25:45.508
- Right.

25:46.614 --> 25:47.614
Of course.

26:00.006 --> 26:01.698
- Good night, Fiona.

26:05.356 --> 26:06.461
- Good night.

27:33.686 --> 27:34.686
- Fuck.

29:24.797 --> 29:25.797
Whoa.

30:34.280 --> 30:35.280
- Fiona.

30:36.248 --> 30:37.662
- Hello, Lassiter.

30:37.663 --> 30:38.974
- How are you feeling?

30:38.975 --> 30:40.527
- I'm fine, thank you.

30:40.528 --> 30:43.151
- No, no, I meant how are
you feeling about the...

30:44.049 --> 30:45.532
- I know.

30:45.533 --> 30:47.051
I'm fine.

30:47.052 --> 30:49.708
Actually, I think I'm
gonna go for a walk.

30:49.709 --> 30:51.228
- Would you like some company?

30:53.334 --> 30:54.644
- No.

30:54.645 --> 30:55.681
Thank you, though.

30:58.787 --> 31:01.513
- Fiona, I wanted
to speak with you.

31:01.514 --> 31:04.172
I have some things on my
mind I'd like to talk about.

31:05.415 --> 31:07.693
- I think I know exactly
what's on your mind.

31:08.970 --> 31:11.628
And just like the last time
you had those thoughts,

31:12.871 --> 31:14.873
I don't wish to entertain them.

31:16.736 --> 31:19.532
So, if you'd please?

33:44.506 --> 33:45.506
That was beautiful.

33:45.506 --> 33:46.403
- Jesus!

33:46.404 --> 33:47.472
- Oh my god, I'm sorry.

33:47.473 --> 33:49.027
I didn't mean to frighten you.

33:51.201 --> 33:52.202
- No, it's okay.

33:54.066 --> 33:56.205
I just thought I was alone.

33:56.206 --> 34:00.416
- I like taking walks
through here sometimes

34:00.417 --> 34:01.625
to clear my head.

34:04.249 --> 34:05.421
And I thought I heard you,

34:05.422 --> 34:07.355
so I thought it'd be
polite to say hi.

34:08.701 --> 34:10.393
That's really
beautiful, Brandon.

34:13.154 --> 34:14.154
- Thanks.

34:16.295 --> 34:17.331
It was her favorite.

34:22.405 --> 34:26.995
So, can't get enough dead
people back at the mortuary?

34:29.826 --> 34:31.620
- Well, while they
are a good reminder

34:31.621 --> 34:33.931
of how fragile we are,

34:33.933 --> 34:38.489
a walk out here beats doing
yoga in the mortuary any day.

34:40.353 --> 34:43.183
- There's a joke about rigor
mortis I'm missing out on here.

34:43.184 --> 34:46.462
- Yeah, I'm gonna
pretend that it landed.

34:46.463 --> 34:47.463
- Thanks.

34:52.054 --> 34:53.884
- Oh, I didn't take
you as a smoker.

34:56.646 --> 34:58.578
- I didn't take my
mom for one either.

34:58.579 --> 34:59.579
- That was hers?

35:02.790 --> 35:03.929
- Yeah, I had no idea.

35:04.895 --> 35:06.207
Found it in a drawer

35:07.588 --> 35:08.692
next to a Bible

35:10.073 --> 35:12.869
and a... special box.

35:14.526 --> 35:16.424
- Was there anything
else in the box?

35:18.599 --> 35:19.599
- Yeah.

35:22.327 --> 35:26.469
There was a personal... device.

35:31.163 --> 35:34.891
The kind that
requires batteries.

35:37.411 --> 35:38.549
- Oh!

35:38.550 --> 35:41.448
- Oh, my god, wow.

35:41.449 --> 35:42.278
- Yeah.

35:42.278 --> 35:43.278
- No way.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.383
- Hand to God.

35:45.384 --> 35:47.799
- Oh, that must've
been really weird.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.181
- It was a little strange.

35:50.769 --> 35:52.115
It's just so surreal.

35:54.082 --> 35:55.705
So much I didn't know about her.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.054
- Hey, everyone has secrets.

36:01.366 --> 36:03.539
They just become truth

36:03.540 --> 36:05.473
when there's no one
left to keep them.

36:08.856 --> 36:10.098
- That's some deep shit.

36:10.961 --> 36:13.585
- Well, my sister tells me
that I have an old soul.

36:15.138 --> 36:16.381
- She's not wrong.

36:17.865 --> 36:22.904
And your advice about
the memento, I took it.

36:25.390 --> 36:26.390
- I'm glad.

36:30.291 --> 36:35.193
Hey, how've you been since
everything happened?

36:37.540 --> 36:38.540
- Honestly?

36:40.922 --> 36:41.922
Not great.

36:45.030 --> 36:47.342
Turned in the keys to
the house this morning,

36:47.343 --> 36:51.001
and so I'm sleeping in a
hotel, which is fine.

36:52.451 --> 36:57.180
I just never not had my mom.

37:01.667 --> 37:03.048
And now that she's gone,

37:04.083 --> 37:07.811
I can't seem to let
anybody else in.

37:10.055 --> 37:12.920
Pushed my aunt out as soon
as I possibly could and...

37:15.957 --> 37:19.237
I've been having these dreams.

37:24.828 --> 37:27.383
I just don't feel like
myself anymore, you know?

37:30.696 --> 37:31.696
- Dreams?

37:36.909 --> 37:37.945
- They just started.

37:40.741 --> 37:41.741
And...

37:43.468 --> 37:44.952
I'm hanging myself

37:48.024 --> 37:51.027
in the same place that
she did every time.

37:54.237 --> 37:55.273
And I get up there

37:59.035 --> 38:00.035
and I look down

38:04.696 --> 38:08.769
and I can't help but think,
"How could she have done it?"

38:10.391 --> 38:11.737
"I could never."

38:23.715 --> 38:24.888
She left me alone.

38:29.272 --> 38:30.756
She didn't even leave a note.

38:35.209 --> 38:36.831
She left without saying goodbye.

38:39.040 --> 38:41.146
And that's what kills me.

38:47.808 --> 38:49.085
- Brandon, hey.

38:51.743 --> 38:56.264
She would've wanted you to
know how much she loved you.

39:02.443 --> 39:03.548
- I should get going.

39:04.825 --> 39:06.204
- Oh, are you sure?

39:06.205 --> 39:07.605
I can always stay
if you need me to.

39:07.629 --> 39:09.701
- Oh, no, it's fine,
Fiona, thank you.

39:12.557 --> 39:14.179
See you around.

39:48.420 --> 39:49.420
- What's the matter?

39:51.906 --> 39:53.839
- I think I've made a mistake.

39:55.082 --> 39:57.048
- Oh, my sister?

39:57.049 --> 39:59.673
My sister, that doesn't
sound like her.

40:03.987 --> 40:06.438
- The dreams are preventing
him from healing.

40:08.509 --> 40:10.615
He's not ready for this life.

40:14.377 --> 40:16.621
- Does it change the way
you feel about him?

40:20.625 --> 40:21.970
- No.

40:21.971 --> 40:24.836
- Because it's a little
late to turn back now.

40:27.666 --> 40:28.666
Hey.

40:29.841 --> 40:32.809
No one ever said that
this was gonna be easy.

40:33.672 --> 40:35.673
He's alone.

40:35.674 --> 40:39.919
He needs a soft touch to
consider what to do next,

40:39.920 --> 40:42.784
not someone with doubts.

40:42.785 --> 40:44.269
And at this point,

40:45.926 --> 40:49.998
you need him far more
than he needs you.

40:49.999 --> 40:51.034
So, stay the path.

40:57.558 --> 40:58.558
- Kat.

40:59.871 --> 41:01.459
Is it really worth it?

41:02.563 --> 41:06.602
You and Lassiter are so unhappy.

41:12.193 --> 41:13.471
- We have an arrangement.

41:15.818 --> 41:16.818
But you...

41:18.234 --> 41:22.203
Oh, you have a chance
at so much more.

41:23.066 --> 41:27.312
And every day being
with you is worth it.

41:28.451 --> 41:29.901
Every single day.

41:32.179 --> 41:34.387
- No, you're right.

41:34.388 --> 41:35.320
You're right.

41:35.321 --> 41:37.287
- I know, I know.

41:38.323 --> 41:39.979
I love you.

41:39.980 --> 41:40.946
- I'm sorry, Kat.

41:40.947 --> 41:43.431
I love you too. - That's okay.

42:23.920 --> 42:24.920
- Hi.

42:26.889 --> 42:27.959
- What are you doing here?

42:29.788 --> 42:31.340
- Well, funerals
can be difficult,

42:31.341 --> 42:34.551
so I at least like to
check up on the families

42:34.552 --> 42:36.104
and make sure
they're doing okay.

42:36.105 --> 42:37.555
You know, go the extra mile.

42:38.694 --> 42:42.282
- Well, you've gone
many more miles

42:42.283 --> 42:44.147
than necessary, Fiona, so

42:45.873 --> 42:46.873
thank you.

42:49.636 --> 42:53.812
- So, how does one get in the
21st century train business?

42:56.056 --> 42:57.333
- That's a good question.

42:59.300 --> 43:01.855
Well, I am my father's son,
if you can believe it.

43:03.581 --> 43:08.275
He died when I was little in
the very same job I do now.

43:09.103 --> 43:11.967
- So, you liked trains when
you were little too then?

43:11.968 --> 43:14.315
- No, no, I hated them actually.

43:16.283 --> 43:18.112
It scared me shitless.

43:19.113 --> 43:20.113
I'm telling you.

43:21.460 --> 43:22.840
Thomas the Train is one thing,

43:22.841 --> 43:24.601
but you're a toddler

43:24.602 --> 43:27.018
and your dad takes you to
the front of that thing,

43:28.502 --> 43:33.024
the engine, it's a totally
different experience.

43:34.508 --> 43:37.304
It's loud, and I hated loud.

43:40.997 --> 43:42.378
- Do you remember him well?

43:44.656 --> 43:46.002
- Not much more than that.

43:47.003 --> 43:48.556
He smelled like engine grease.

43:55.184 --> 43:57.219
How do you do that?

43:57.220 --> 43:58.220
- What?

43:59.222 --> 44:00.292
- Get people talking.

44:01.949 --> 44:04.641
I mean, I haven't felt
much about my dad

44:04.642 --> 44:05.918
one way or the other in years,

44:05.919 --> 44:08.680
and here we are trading secrets.

44:09.992 --> 44:11.130
- Ooh, I don't know

44:11.131 --> 44:13.271
if I'd exactly call
this trading, Brandon.

44:14.375 --> 44:15.375
- You're right.

44:16.032 --> 44:17.032
Your turn.

44:19.139 --> 44:21.279
- Well, you know how I
feel about secrets.

44:23.799 --> 44:24.799
- I suppose I do.

44:28.700 --> 44:31.806
Listen, I just got
on my lunch break

44:31.807 --> 44:35.154
and there's a pretty
scenic overlook

44:35.155 --> 44:37.709
I like to eat my sandwiches,

44:40.091 --> 44:41.644
if you'd care to join me.

44:45.096 --> 44:46.096
- Okay.

44:51.930 --> 44:53.724
I didn't grow up here.

44:53.725 --> 44:54.725
- No?

44:56.383 --> 45:00.766
I thought the funeral business
was a family tradition.

45:00.767 --> 45:01.733
- Oh, it is.

45:01.734 --> 45:04.322
Just came a long way
off to inherit it.

45:06.255 --> 45:07.255
- Uh-huh.

45:08.257 --> 45:09.257
- It's true.

45:12.606 --> 45:14.194
- So, where's a long way off?

45:15.782 --> 45:17.092
- All over.

45:17.093 --> 45:18.853
I moved around a lot as a kid.

45:18.854 --> 45:19.854
- World traveler?

45:20.614 --> 45:21.614
- Exactly.

45:23.134 --> 45:26.515
Never really got
to know my father.

45:26.516 --> 45:28.380
Katarina says it's for the best.

45:30.244 --> 45:31.244
And my mom,

45:33.938 --> 45:36.181
she passed away recently.

45:37.873 --> 45:39.874
But it was her time.

45:39.875 --> 45:40.875
- I'm sorry.

45:46.778 --> 45:48.642
What about the funeral home?

45:49.608 --> 45:51.333
- It was an uncle's.

45:51.334 --> 45:54.302
We took over for him
when he passed on too.

45:54.303 --> 45:55.579
- That's so weird.

45:55.580 --> 45:58.651
I don't remember you or your
uncle ever owning that place.

45:58.652 --> 46:00.101
- Well, you know what they say,

46:00.102 --> 46:04.484
best not to get too cozy
with a funeral director.

46:04.485 --> 46:06.004
- You're not wrong about that.

46:08.455 --> 46:11.595
- It actually used to
be a butcher shop,

46:11.596 --> 46:13.493
about a hundred years ago.

46:13.494 --> 46:14.701
- No.

46:14.702 --> 46:15.702
- Yeah!

46:15.703 --> 46:16.911
- That's terrible.

46:16.912 --> 46:18.567
- Yeah.

46:18.568 --> 46:20.777
Oh god, please don't
tell anybody about that

46:20.778 --> 46:23.573
or we probably would be out
of business pretty quickly.

46:25.265 --> 46:26.644
- I don't know about that.

46:26.645 --> 46:28.765
You must have another way of
putting food on the table

46:28.789 --> 46:31.827
if you're just handing
out funerals on a whim.

46:34.550 --> 46:36.172
- Yeah, we figure it out.

46:45.319 --> 46:46.873
God, I still can't get over it.

46:48.564 --> 46:52.188
They never change, but they
always take my breath away.

46:54.812 --> 46:55.812
- The mountains?

46:59.747 --> 47:02.302
- Sometimes I like to think
that we've already died

47:04.304 --> 47:05.304
and this is it.

47:09.861 --> 47:10.861
- Heaven.

47:11.932 --> 47:12.932
- Sure.

47:14.003 --> 47:15.003
Wherever.

47:18.249 --> 47:19.388
- That's some thought.

47:22.149 --> 47:23.702
- You don't think
it could be true?

47:29.881 --> 47:31.952
- Where do we go after
we leave here then?

47:35.783 --> 47:37.130
- Maybe we just
get to start over

47:38.683 --> 47:43.274
from the beginning with
everyone that we've ever loved.

47:46.415 --> 47:47.415
- Maybe.

47:50.005 --> 47:52.144
- I like to think that the
first people I get to see

47:52.145 --> 47:54.699
would be my mother and father.

47:56.908 --> 47:59.083
It'd be like Heaven to me.

48:56.968 --> 48:57.968
- No.

48:58.694 --> 49:00.223
No.

49:00.247 --> 49:01.466
No.

49:01.490 --> 49:02.777
No.

49:02.801 --> 49:05.976
No, no, no, no, no.

49:05.977 --> 49:10.982
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

49:11.189 --> 49:12.534
No.

49:12.535 --> 49:17.575
No, no, no, no.

50:58.710 --> 51:00.057
- What are you doing here?

51:03.025 --> 51:05.269
Lassiter, no.

51:06.097 --> 51:07.097
- Take it.

51:08.099 --> 51:09.099
Take it!

51:18.316 --> 51:19.421
- This has to stop.

51:24.115 --> 51:25.565
- Katarina hates me.

51:30.673 --> 51:32.158
- You made your choice.

51:36.438 --> 51:40.269
- You don't know what it is
to be hated or to be used.

51:41.201 --> 51:43.203
You only know love and loss.

51:44.549 --> 51:46.068
I have love for you

51:46.896 --> 51:49.589
and I will make it so that
you never lose it again.

51:57.459 --> 51:59.116
- You're a psychopath.

52:04.122 --> 52:05.122
- Love is...

52:05.122 --> 52:06.122
- No.

52:07.400 --> 52:08.780
You're pathetic,

52:09.609 --> 52:11.161
not love.

52:11.162 --> 52:12.576
You.

52:12.577 --> 52:14.233
You spend so much
time watching me,

52:14.234 --> 52:16.340
but do you know what
you are to Katarina?

52:17.479 --> 52:19.757
A glorified lawn gnome.

52:20.723 --> 52:25.694
Your life is the sorry price
of keeping her alive.

52:30.492 --> 52:33.391
And you're too much of a
coward to do anything else.

52:43.401 --> 52:44.885
You always could have left.

52:50.546 --> 52:52.169
- Love doesn't work that way.

52:55.551 --> 52:57.001
- I don't love you.

55:41.545 --> 55:42.545
- Bite me.

55:47.171 --> 55:48.171
- What?

55:49.794 --> 55:50.794
- Bite me.

56:04.602 --> 56:06.155
- Sorry.

56:09.849 --> 56:11.057
- I wanted it.

57:40.905 --> 57:42.528
- What do you want?

57:47.118 --> 57:49.466
Can't this wait until tomorrow?

57:52.779 --> 57:54.816
- Why won't she love me?

58:02.030 --> 58:04.860
- Because she's better
than you, that's why.

58:20.151 --> 58:22.568
Get your hands off of me.

58:43.485 --> 58:45.831
You wouldn't dare.

58:45.832 --> 58:48.455
You're a rat with a
gift, nothing more.

01:00:15.646 --> 01:00:16.646
- Brandon.

01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:20.132
Hey, hey, Brandon, hey.

01:00:20.133 --> 01:00:21.238
Brandon, hey.

01:00:23.965 --> 01:00:24.965
Hey. - Hey.

01:00:33.008 --> 01:00:34.216
How you doin'?

01:00:36.874 --> 01:00:39.808
- I need to talk to
you about something.

01:00:47.747 --> 01:00:48.747
- Okay.

01:00:53.684 --> 01:00:56.307
- I had a lot on my mind.

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:02.003
I know if I don't
tell you now, I...

01:01:05.144 --> 01:01:07.767
Whatever you decide, I will
respect your decision.

01:01:12.082 --> 01:01:13.083
- What is this?

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.915
Are you clean, hmm?

01:01:18.951 --> 01:01:21.091
Geez, you're not
dying or anything.

01:01:25.612 --> 01:01:26.683
- Not exactly.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:34.414
That song that I sang at
dinner, do you remember it?

01:01:39.005 --> 01:01:40.282
There's a bit more to it.

01:01:41.905 --> 01:01:43.871
I'll spare you the serenade,

01:01:43.872 --> 01:01:46.599
but it boils down to the
secret of eternal life.

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.258
- I don't...

01:01:51.259 --> 01:01:52.293
What?

01:01:52.294 --> 01:01:54.054
- Okay, you know, the
sooner that you realize

01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:57.357
that I'm not kidding, the
easier this is gonna be.

01:02:00.993 --> 01:02:07.793
I am... 314 years old.

01:02:08.172 --> 01:02:11.450
And Katarina and
Lassiter are even older.

01:02:11.451 --> 01:02:14.247
- Fuck you.

01:02:15.662 --> 01:02:16.662
- Shut up

01:02:17.664 --> 01:02:18.804
and listen to me.

01:02:22.911 --> 01:02:23.911
- Okay.

01:02:26.156 --> 01:02:30.677
- The song presents
it as a riddle.

01:02:32.403 --> 01:02:36.822
My sister and I and our
husbands figured it out.

01:02:37.788 --> 01:02:39.651
You need to eat to live.

01:02:39.652 --> 01:02:42.378
You have to eat your
mother, your lover,

01:02:42.379 --> 01:02:45.865
and part of yourself, and
then you live forever.

01:02:46.728 --> 01:02:48.557
After that, anyone will do.

01:02:50.525 --> 01:02:53.976
But you have to have
the flesh of man,

01:02:53.977 --> 01:03:00.742
the breath of time herself,
and then you never age, ever.

01:03:02.364 --> 01:03:03.848
- Wait.

01:03:03.849 --> 01:03:04.849
Wait.

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:06.782
Back it up.

01:03:08.198 --> 01:03:09.268
You were married?

01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:11.669
- That's what you
got from all this?

01:03:11.693 --> 01:03:13.305
- I'm sorry, it's just,

01:03:13.306 --> 01:03:15.792
it's the only thing you
said that made any sense.

01:03:23.006 --> 01:03:24.006
- I was.

01:03:25.836 --> 01:03:26.836
And he died.

01:03:32.015 --> 01:03:35.156
- I'm starting to see
some holes in your story.

01:03:37.192 --> 01:03:38.815
- Anyone can break the song.

01:03:41.024 --> 01:03:45.373
When he killed himself,
I started aging again.

01:03:48.134 --> 01:03:50.067
- And why would he do that, hmm?

01:03:53.657 --> 01:03:54.900
- I don't know.

01:03:58.869 --> 01:04:00.837
But the song requires a lover.

01:04:02.252 --> 01:04:04.563
Time lives alone.

01:04:04.564 --> 01:04:06.843
So, to beat her, you can't.

01:04:09.052 --> 01:04:10.536
Without another,

01:04:12.262 --> 01:04:13.746
I can't go on living.

01:04:17.612 --> 01:04:18.958
- So, you and...

01:04:20.133 --> 01:04:21.133
- John.

01:04:21.134 --> 01:04:22.859
- John, right,

01:04:23.929 --> 01:04:27.518
and Katarina and Lassiter then,

01:04:28.623 --> 01:04:33.628
you all got together and ate
your mothers and each other

01:04:34.215 --> 01:04:38.287
and now you're just kicking it

01:04:38.288 --> 01:04:40.048
around the countryside
ever since?

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.402
Okay, where do I come in?

01:04:51.611 --> 01:04:52.611
- I started aging.

01:04:53.613 --> 01:04:54.856
I need another.

01:04:56.409 --> 01:04:57.409
And...

01:05:08.007 --> 01:05:09.007
I love you.

01:05:13.599 --> 01:05:14.945
- So, you thought...

01:05:17.085 --> 01:05:18.085
Fiona.

01:05:20.813 --> 01:05:22.504
This is insane.

01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:31.340
I don't know what you're
trying to pull here.

01:05:31.341 --> 01:05:32.341
This is crazy.

01:05:38.279 --> 01:05:39.797
I mean, last night was great.

01:05:41.247 --> 01:05:43.047
And the biting thing,
that was a little weird,

01:05:43.071 --> 01:05:44.663
but I went with it,

01:05:44.664 --> 01:05:46.104
but now you're just
talking nonsense.

01:05:46.128 --> 01:05:48.993
- Those dreams, they're
getting worse aren't they?

01:05:50.877 --> 01:05:52.914
And that song that's
stuck in your head.

01:05:54.364 --> 01:05:56.262
Brandon, it's already started.

01:06:04.719 --> 01:06:05.962
- You're fuckin' insane.

01:06:07.342 --> 01:06:09.240
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:06:09.241 --> 01:06:12.485
- Fiona, I didn't eat anyone.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:19.699
- I'm sorry, Brandon.

01:06:22.426 --> 01:06:23.426
- For what?

01:06:26.465 --> 01:06:27.569
- The dinner.

01:06:28.674 --> 01:06:29.674
You...

01:06:32.126 --> 01:06:36.474
- I what?

01:06:36.475 --> 01:06:37.855
What do I do, Fiona?

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.720
What did I do?

01:06:43.585 --> 01:06:44.585
- You ate her.

01:06:46.036 --> 01:06:47.036
And me.

01:06:49.143 --> 01:06:52.179
Brandon, please, it's okay.

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.629
Brandon!

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:56.252
- Stay the fuck away from me.

01:06:56.253 --> 01:06:58.461
- No, Brandon, no!

01:06:58.462 --> 01:06:59.463
Brandon!

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:14.270
Brandon!

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:16.239
Brandon, wait!

01:07:18.103 --> 01:07:19.344
Wait.

01:07:19.345 --> 01:07:21.209
- Get the fuck off me.

01:07:30.563 --> 01:07:33.393
How do I stop it?

01:07:33.394 --> 01:07:36.362
How do I stop it, Fiona?

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:44.405
- You won't have an
appetite for anything else.

01:07:46.096 --> 01:07:47.856
But if you eat, it'll stop.

01:07:52.516 --> 01:07:54.115
I'm sorry.

01:07:54.139 --> 01:07:55.139
I'm sorry.

01:07:56.486 --> 01:07:59.557
I don't why I felt
so drawn to you.

01:07:59.558 --> 01:08:01.525
- You barely fucking know me!

01:08:03.355 --> 01:08:04.804
- Didn't you feel something?

01:08:06.047 --> 01:08:07.152
- You fed me.

01:08:08.187 --> 01:08:10.119
- I love you.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.120
I love you.

01:08:16.437 --> 01:08:17.576
- You're a psychopath.

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:33.279
I don't want this.

01:08:35.283 --> 01:08:36.283
- Yeah, you do.

01:08:37.803 --> 01:08:38.803
It's not from me.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.703
It's from your mother.

01:08:44.327 --> 01:08:45.776
She's how I found you.

01:08:47.502 --> 01:08:50.264
She really loved you, Brandon.

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:28.233
- My dearest Brandon,

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:30.372
I love you so completely.

01:09:30.372 --> 01:09:31.787
You are my only pride.

01:09:31.787 --> 01:09:33.202
I no longer want to be a burden.

01:09:33.203 --> 01:09:34.307
My beloved song.

01:09:34.308 --> 01:09:35.825
So many of my mistakes
aren't yours.

01:09:35.826 --> 01:09:37.792
I have kept you to
myself for too long.

01:09:37.794 --> 01:09:40.416
I owe all of the happiness
of my life to you.

01:09:40.417 --> 01:09:42.279
Don't be alone.

01:09:42.281 --> 01:09:43.834
Marry someone you love.

01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:06.374
- Well hello, Brandon.

01:10:41.651 --> 01:10:42.686
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

01:10:43.998 --> 01:10:46.794
Careful now, or I may slip.

01:10:49.003 --> 01:10:51.626
Life is so precious a thing.

01:10:52.731 --> 01:10:55.767
Fickle and tenuous.

01:10:55.768 --> 01:10:58.426
A little bit this way,
a little bit that,

01:10:59.427 --> 01:11:00.739
and you may just end one.

01:11:03.569 --> 01:11:07.055
I'd say that death is
what I'm most afraid of,

01:11:08.125 --> 01:11:10.714
but really it's the not
knowing that gets me.

01:11:11.612 --> 01:11:16.651
Even so, there are worse
things than taking a life,

01:11:18.101 --> 01:11:19.309
and that's ruining one.

01:11:20.828 --> 01:11:22.587
And you ruined mine.

01:11:22.588 --> 01:11:25.039
She loves you and not me,

01:11:26.178 --> 01:11:27.869
and you don't even
want her back.

01:11:33.047 --> 01:11:35.912
Don't worry, it's
nothing essential.

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:49.511
- No!

01:11:49.512 --> 01:11:51.064
- No, no!

01:11:51.065 --> 01:11:53.584
- No, no!

01:11:53.585 --> 01:11:54.619
Kat!

01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:58.071
Kat!

01:11:58.072 --> 01:12:02.318
No!

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.742
- So, I know what
you're thinking.

01:12:14.951 --> 01:12:18.505
Why not end it all if my
never-ending life is ruined?

01:12:18.506 --> 01:12:21.958
And to that, I say, stick
with the devil you know.

01:12:24.547 --> 01:12:29.586
Now, my life is ruined
and you're on my table.

01:12:29.793 --> 01:12:33.382
And I had to think, what
would be worse for you:

01:12:33.383 --> 01:12:37.317
the dark uncertainty
of death or my curse,

01:12:37.318 --> 01:12:39.492
a never-ending life of pain

01:12:39.493 --> 01:12:43.324
with a woman you don't love
and a stupid fucking song?

01:12:44.774 --> 01:12:47.223
Should I kill you or just shove

01:12:47.224 --> 01:12:49.502
a piece of your own
kidney down your throat

01:12:49.503 --> 01:12:50.849
and into Fiona's dinner?

01:12:51.815 --> 01:12:55.991
I have to be honest, I
flip-flop on the matter a bit

01:12:55.992 --> 01:12:57.925
until I came up with
something better.

01:13:01.204 --> 01:13:03.275
I'll make you choose.

01:13:19.015 --> 01:13:20.879
- I love you, Brandon.

01:13:31.786 --> 01:13:33.442
