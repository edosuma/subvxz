00:01.853 --> 00:03.285
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:03.286 --> 00:04.082
What's going on?

00:04.083 --> 00:06.123
Are we trying to fix
things between us or not?

00:06.124 --> 00:07.451
I don't know the answers yet.

00:07.452 --> 00:10.086
I think now we're just choosing
what our future's gonna be.

00:10.087 --> 00:12.319
We've kept this secret a long time.

00:13.193 --> 00:15.183
You had an affair with her, right? No.

00:15.434 --> 00:17.605
Guess you made the right
choice... him over me?

00:17.606 --> 00:19.309
I can't do this with you.

00:19.334 --> 00:20.882
Then don't do it.

00:20.883 --> 00:21.618
Come with me.

00:21.619 --> 00:24.363
You should be on the road, writing music.

00:24.364 --> 00:25.663
Sorry for the holdup.

00:25.891 --> 00:28.373
Did you hire him? No, of course not.

00:28.374 --> 00:31.004
I'm not here for your band.
He's joining mine.

00:49.873 --> 00:50.904
Juliette!

00:51.616 --> 00:52.781
There's Rayna right there! Ohh!

00:52.782 --> 00:54.953
Just got word we sold out both nights.

00:54.954 --> 00:56.422
Chicago loves you.

00:56.470 --> 00:58.029
Us, I guess.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.103
Did you have no idea he was
gonna be on this tour?

01:03.104 --> 01:03.828
I did not know.

01:03.829 --> 01:05.247
Are you pissed that I hired Deacon?

01:05.248 --> 01:07.895
Why would I be pissed? Hey, y'all.
How are you?

01:07.896 --> 01:09.333
Hi, guys!

01:11.542 --> 01:13.845
I love you, Rayna! Thank you.

01:14.644 --> 01:15.934
Thank you guys!

01:15.935 --> 01:17.141
Bye, y'all.

01:17.682 --> 01:18.687
That's not a big plane,

01:18.688 --> 01:20.453
and you didn't make eye
contact with me once

01:20.454 --> 01:21.665
after Deacon got on.

01:21.666 --> 01:24.092
I am amazed you had nothing
better to do on that plane ride

01:24.093 --> 01:26.635
than just look over at me to
see if I was lookin' at you.

01:26.636 --> 01:28.144
Just admit that you're pissed.

01:28.145 --> 01:30.646
Girl, are you ever gonna grow up? Honestly.

01:30.647 --> 01:32.044
Let's go, buck.

01:35.642 --> 01:37.333
They'll bring your bags
up for you, you know.

01:37.334 --> 01:39.609
Yeah, I know. I'm looking for my guitar.

01:39.611 --> 01:41.273
It's not my first rodeo.

01:41.346 --> 01:42.780
Your first time at my rodeo.

01:42.781 --> 01:44.495
Yeah, this is some entourage you got.

01:44.496 --> 01:46.207
Takes a lot of people to make a good show.

01:46.208 --> 01:49.151
Really? Johnny cash only needed three.

01:53.262 --> 01:54.733
Why do you think he's here?

01:54.989 --> 01:56.585
I don't know, ray. Why don't you ask him?

01:56.586 --> 01:58.257
Hell, no. I'm not gonna ask him.

01:58.258 --> 02:00.481
I gotta go talk about all
this on the phone with Teddy,

02:00.482 --> 02:01.376
I got a show tonight.

02:01.377 --> 02:04.596
I don't need any Deacon Claybourne drama.

02:04.597 --> 02:07.036
Do you think I have too
many people on my band?

02:07.827 --> 02:10.626
I think you got a world-class
arena show that people love.

02:10.627 --> 02:12.392
Juliette, this is gonna be huge.

02:12.513 --> 02:14.916
Look, you got all your
bad press behind you,

02:14.917 --> 02:15.995
your mom's out of the public eye,

02:15.996 --> 02:17.508
she's finishing up rehab. That's great.

02:17.509 --> 02:18.478
This is gonna close the deal

02:18.479 --> 02:19.859
on getting your brand back on track.

02:19.860 --> 02:21.867
Boom... you're gonna be right
back where you were.

02:21.868 --> 02:23.662
What if I don't wanna be
right back where I was?

02:23.663 --> 02:25.783
You don't wanna go back to
being on top of the world?

02:25.882 --> 02:27.319
That's not what I meant.

02:28.085 --> 02:29.687
Well, what did you mean?

02:30.061 --> 02:31.154
Forget it.

03:07.702 --> 03:09.420
Fixed. Thank you.

03:09.801 --> 03:11.498
Hey, we sounded pretty
good the other night.

03:11.499 --> 03:14.163
J.T. played me the scratch track
he recorded on his phone.

03:14.164 --> 03:15.251
It was all right.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.601
Just all right?

03:17.262 --> 03:18.221
Yeah.

03:20.879 --> 03:22.147
I figure you still don't wanna talk

03:22.148 --> 03:24.084
about what got your fur
all backwards in Texas,

03:24.085 --> 03:27.071
but, uh, if you ain't gonna talk about it,

03:27.072 --> 03:29.147
maybe you should just
quit worrying about it.

03:29.148 --> 03:32.492
It's nothing. It's... my roommates.

03:33.155 --> 03:35.392
It was a bad idea living with band mates,

03:36.092 --> 03:36.845
and they've been messing with me

03:36.846 --> 03:38.544
ever since I started
playing with you and J.T.

03:38.545 --> 03:39.840
Messing with you how?

03:45.026 --> 03:46.073
Why is it a turtle?

03:46.074 --> 03:47.442
I have no idea.

03:52.786 --> 03:54.595
Miss O'Connor. Mr. Mason. Hi.

03:54.596 --> 03:56.145
When you and Avery moved in here,

03:56.146 --> 03:58.339
you promised you would always
pay your rent on time.

03:58.340 --> 04:00.111
Now I went out on a limb
giving you this place.

04:00.112 --> 04:02.860
I know that you did, Mr. Mason.
I am truly sorry.

04:03.229 --> 04:04.524
But I have a paying gig tonight,

04:04.525 --> 04:06.070
and I get my paycheck tomorrow.

04:06.071 --> 04:08.198
This will never happen again.

04:08.199 --> 04:09.477
I like you, miss O'Connor,

04:09.478 --> 04:10.818
but if I don't have it in two days,

04:10.819 --> 04:13.417
I'm gonna have to find new tenants.
Do you understand me?

04:13.685 --> 04:14.801
Yes, sir.

04:23.244 --> 04:24.826
Doesn't Avery owe you a bunch of money?

04:24.827 --> 04:26.484
Yeah, he does, but, uh,

04:26.790 --> 04:28.151
gettin' that would involve seeing him,

04:28.152 --> 04:29.310
which is probably not the best idea.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.356
Doesn't matter. No point.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.787
But we're gonna bring
down the house tonight,

04:32.788 --> 04:34.615
and we'll be rollin' in it, right?

04:35.065 --> 04:36.737
Well, I like your optimism.

04:36.836 --> 04:39.459
You may be delusional, but
it's workin' for you.

04:39.460 --> 04:40.869
Thank you. Go on. Get.

04:40.870 --> 04:42.489
All right. See you later.

04:42.490 --> 04:45.065
Bye. Bye.

04:45.409 --> 04:46.434
I did not know.

04:46.435 --> 04:47.905
Yeah, all right. Whatever you say.

04:47.906 --> 04:49.588
Hey, please don't be like that.

04:49.589 --> 04:51.285
No, no, look, what do you want me to say?

04:51.588 --> 04:53.224
That... that I find it incredibly strange

04:53.225 --> 04:54.922
that you tell me you need time to process,

04:54.923 --> 04:56.570
and then Deacon ends up on your tour?

04:56.571 --> 04:59.158
W... he's here for Juliette's tour.

04:59.159 --> 05:00.516
Lord knows I didn't hire him,

05:00.517 --> 05:02.753
and she doesn't run her
hiring decisions by me.

05:06.313 --> 05:08.251
but I think it's really important.

05:08.252 --> 05:10.737
Please don't let this
Deacon thing derail that.

05:10.738 --> 05:13.035
I don't want him here, you know?

05:13.036 --> 05:14.103
I fired him.

05:14.104 --> 05:16.039
So you haven't seen him since then?

05:19.502 --> 05:21.301
You have seen him since then.

05:22.700 --> 05:27.637
I-I... I have seen him... out of concern,

05:27.638 --> 05:29.542
because we are friends.

05:29.543 --> 05:32.024
We have been friends for 20
years, as you well know.

05:32.025 --> 05:33.664
Look, I have a meeting with
some city council members.

05:33.665 --> 05:34.387
I gotta go.

05:34.388 --> 05:35.426
Teddy... okay, look...

05:35.427 --> 05:36.858
okay, Rayna, I get it.

05:37.122 --> 05:39.331
You didn't know about Deacon,
you didn't plan any of this,

05:39.332 --> 05:41.048
life's a bitch sometimes,
and you're processing.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.454
Have we covered it all?

05:42.472 --> 05:43.552
Yeah.

05:44.749 --> 05:46.107
Okay. Great.

05:46.945 --> 05:47.947
Bye...

05:56.755 --> 05:57.995
belmont called.

05:57.996 --> 06:00.422
They want you to come back in the spring.
They loved you.

06:00.851 --> 06:02.786
We'll get you paid better for round two.

06:03.310 --> 06:05.068
Tomorrow, you've got the
crew from "star towns"

06:05.069 --> 06:06.360
following you around.

06:06.361 --> 06:07.752
What am I supposed to do with them?

06:07.753 --> 06:11.011
The show is musicians sharing
the cities that they love.

06:11.181 --> 06:12.712
Every episode, they have one star

06:12.713 --> 06:14.251
and one up-and-coming act.

06:14.252 --> 06:15.058
The producer's a friend

06:15.059 --> 06:17.136
and called about you after
he heard you on the radio.

06:17.254 --> 06:18.275
Okay.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.351
Xxx

06:19.519 --> 06:20.785
Avery, this is good.

06:20.869 --> 06:22.244
This is exactly what we need

06:22.245 --> 06:24.699
to cement you as the next big thing.

06:27.466 --> 06:28.505
What are you doing?

06:29.471 --> 06:30.732
Uh, nothing.

06:30.820 --> 06:31.684

11:34.167 --> 11:35.777
J., listen... ever?

11:36.316 --> 11:39.478
You're a multi-million dollar industry.

11:39.684 --> 11:42.860
A left turn now could be
an exit into obscurity.

11:42.861 --> 11:45.254
Just please, think about it long and hard

11:45.255 --> 11:48.419
before you mess with it too much.

11:58.714 --> 12:01.340
I am so happy you're here, Adria.
Thank you.

12:01.341 --> 12:02.709
Thank you. It's an honor.

12:02.710 --> 12:03.769
It's an honor playing with you,

12:03.770 --> 12:05.409
and thanks for bringing me on.

12:06.185 --> 12:06.788
Thank you.

12:06.789 --> 12:08.206
Thrilled to be your new guitar player.

12:08.207 --> 12:10.018
Great show tonight, guys. Y'all killed it.

12:10.019 --> 12:11.308
Thanks, Bucky. Yeah.

12:11.309 --> 12:13.028
Well, I'll see you guys later. Right?

12:13.029 --> 12:13.836
Okay. All right.

12:13.837 --> 12:14.361
Bye. Bye, babe.

12:14.362 --> 12:16.063
Nice job. Whoo-hoo!

12:16.064 --> 12:18.418
So, uh, how you feelin' about her?

12:18.865 --> 12:21.125
She's kind of... thanks... she's
kind of got a different energy

12:21.126 --> 12:22.434
than your other bandleaders.

12:22.435 --> 12:24.076
Oh, you mean, like, a lady energy?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.208
Well, yeah.

12:25.360 --> 12:26.287
You know what? She's amazing.

12:26.288 --> 12:27.078
I think she's perfect.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.989
She's exactly what I need right now.

12:29.594 --> 12:30.606
The only thing is, you know what I missed?

12:30.607 --> 12:32.036
I missed that little riff

12:32.037 --> 12:33.558
right in the front of "already gone."

12:33.559 --> 12:35.121
Yeah. You want me to talk to her?

12:35.213 --> 12:36.940
Actually, uh, you know what?

12:36.941 --> 12:39.117
Uh, hold on a second. Hey, Deacon?

12:39.633 --> 12:41.442
Can I talk to you for a sec?
I'll talk to you later.

12:41.443 --> 12:42.403
Yeah.

12:42.437 --> 12:45.247
Ye, the label deal's a go.
Hey, sounded great tonight.

12:45.248 --> 12:46.357
Thanks, Bucky.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.193
Uh, I was gonna ask you,

12:49.194 --> 12:51.456
remember that... that
lick that we used to do

12:51.476 --> 12:52.870
right before we started "already gone"?

12:52.871 --> 12:54.883
Would you mind talking to Adria about that?

12:54.884 --> 12:56.319
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

12:56.779 --> 12:58.398
Thanks. Sure.

13:00.396 --> 13:01.545
So...

13:02.164 --> 13:04.236
Um, what's going on?

13:05.432 --> 13:06.492
What do you mean?

13:07.329 --> 13:08.760
Well, last time I talked to you,

13:08.761 --> 13:10.487
you were puttin' a sign out
in front of your house,

13:10.488 --> 13:11.886
headed off to your cabin.

13:11.887 --> 13:14.288
Now you're on tour with Juliette Barnes.

13:14.391 --> 13:15.607
What are you doing here?

13:16.211 --> 13:18.126
I play guitar for people that pay me money.

13:18.127 --> 13:20.084
So... I'm doin' that.

13:21.635 --> 13:25.173
Well, if I'm honest, it's
a little bit awkward.

13:26.836 --> 13:28.363
I'll try to stay out of your way.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.180
I'm sorry, guys. Slow night here.

15:06.181 --> 15:07.255
What'd we make?

15:07.477 --> 15:08.975
$144.

15:10.124 --> 15:11.520
Gave up a Friday night's
worth of pay and tips

15:11.521 --> 15:13.210
at the bluebird for $144?

15:13.619 --> 15:16.926
The band made $144. You made $24.

15:17.842 --> 15:19.477
It's not exactly rent money.

15:19.478 --> 15:21.480
Maybe you could ask your Uncle
or your mom for a loan.

15:21.481 --> 15:22.784
I can't do that.

15:22.998 --> 15:25.317
I mean, I'd give you the money if I had it.

15:25.318 --> 15:26.451
You know that.

15:27.330 --> 15:29.878
Thank you. I'll figure it out.

15:39.351 --> 15:40.565
Well, hi there.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.460
Hey there.

15:43.849 --> 15:45.253
Look what the cat dragged in.

15:45.254 --> 15:46.191
Yeah, how 'bout that?

15:46.192 --> 15:50.056
470 Miles of the heartland of America.

15:50.270 --> 15:53.055
Johnny and June and Hank and Emmylou

15:53.056 --> 15:54.579
nonstop on the radio.

15:54.867 --> 15:56.386
How was the show last night?

15:56.604 --> 15:57.905
Packed to the gills.

15:57.906 --> 15:59.462
Can't wait to hear it tonight.

15:59.586 --> 16:01.174
Well, I'll be curious what you think.

16:01.175 --> 16:03.311
Hi. Coffee. Thanks.

16:03.936 --> 16:05.962
So in other news, Marshall Evans

16:05.963 --> 16:08.274
has finally, reluctantly agreed

16:08.275 --> 16:10.313
to give me my own label.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.115
Caveat is I have to bring him a couple acts

16:12.116 --> 16:13.339
that he wants to break.

16:13.340 --> 16:16.004
It's a good step for you.
You got a lot to give back.

16:16.156 --> 16:17.017
Oh, thanks.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.687
So I wanted to ask you about...

16:18.688 --> 16:21.054
uh, remember those kids you
told me about at the bluebird?

16:21.055 --> 16:22.935
Oh, yeah. Deacon's niece.

16:22.936 --> 16:26.020
No, I think it was, uh, it was a duet.

16:26.021 --> 16:27.147
Couple kids. Yeah.

16:27.148 --> 16:29.391
Scarlett O'Connor and Gunnar Scott.

16:29.392 --> 16:30.608
That was Scarlett?

16:30.609 --> 16:31.844
I told you about her.

16:31.845 --> 16:34.272
They are exactly like you and Deacon.

16:34.273 --> 16:36.237
Well, shoot, I don't think I can do that.

16:37.325 --> 16:41.705
Things with me and Deacon are just...
crazy right now.

16:41.706 --> 16:43.925
If you don't sign 'em, somebody else will.

16:43.926 --> 16:45.044
Simple as that.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.367
You think they're that good?

16:50.258 --> 16:52.308
Thank you. Keep the change.

16:52.309 --> 16:54.784
They make the mayor pay for
his own coffee around here?

16:54.785 --> 16:55.473
What is this?

16:55.474 --> 16:57.463
Well, I'm still just mayor-elect.

16:57.464 --> 16:58.322
Maybe once I'm sworn in,

16:58.323 --> 17:00.249
the free coffee will start flowing.

17:00.424 --> 17:03.148
Look at you walking around
differently already.

17:03.183 --> 17:04.311
You... you're wearing it well.

17:04.313 --> 17:06.028
Ah, well, thank you. Oh,
you look good, too.

17:06.029 --> 17:08.964
Thanks. So I heard you
moved into a new place?

17:08.965 --> 17:10.076
Those townhomes around the corner?

17:10.077 --> 17:12.234
I did, I did. I-I love it.

17:12.236 --> 17:15.426
I can walk to everything,
and I'm settling in.

17:17.247 --> 17:18.909
Well, that's good. I'm happy for you.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.762
So we gonna keep up this
cocktail conversation,

17:22.763 --> 17:24.748
or can we just move past it now?

17:24.749 --> 17:27.116
Look, Peggy... I'm sorry. I just...

17:27.656 --> 17:30.007
I never meant for this
campaign to hurt anyone.

17:30.894 --> 17:31.815
You know, I got into this,

17:31.816 --> 17:33.531
thinking that it would fix things,

17:34.043 --> 17:37.226
and now... I feel like I've
only made things worse.

17:37.741 --> 17:40.206
I'm just sorry everything
got so out of my control.

17:40.207 --> 17:44.031
In a way, everything that
happened was for the best.

17:44.032 --> 17:45.305
It finally allowed Robert and me

17:45.306 --> 17:48.243
to admit that our marriage
just wasn't working.

17:48.745 --> 17:51.245
Are you... trying to tell me something?

17:51.944 --> 17:54.167
Are you trying to hear
something in what I'm saying?

17:55.154 --> 17:57.154
?Consider me

18:03.387 --> 18:05.410
I love those chords.

18:05.411 --> 18:06.527
I love those words.

18:06.528 --> 18:08.161
Well, the label's gonna hate it.

18:08.162 --> 18:10.296
My people are going to hate it.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.304
Why? It's not my brand.

18:13.389 --> 18:14.224
That's what it is.

18:14.225 --> 18:16.053
Is that what's been buggin' you? Yeah.

18:16.054 --> 18:18.326
Feels like I'm in a straitjacket.

18:18.327 --> 18:19.772
I mean, you do one thing that they like,

18:19.773 --> 18:22.661
and they're making you do it
over and over and over again,

18:22.662 --> 18:24.416
and that's it. Nothing else.

18:25.167 --> 18:27.281
Don't laugh at me. It's not funny.

18:27.282 --> 18:29.431
I'm not laughing at you. It's just...

18:30.263 --> 18:33.170
I'm rememberin' having the
exact same conversation.

18:33.416 --> 18:34.339
Number of times.

18:34.340 --> 18:35.481
With Rayna?

18:36.516 --> 18:37.673
And others.

18:37.771 --> 18:38.981
What would she do?

18:40.081 --> 18:41.234
What, Rayna?

18:44.144 --> 18:46.119
Well, she'd probably do
what she always does.

18:47.115 --> 18:48.237
Stay true to herself.

18:48.238 --> 18:50.776
She's always had you there to help her.

18:50.777 --> 18:52.317
No, she didn't.

18:53.855 --> 18:55.965
I just don't know that I
only wanna be this girl

18:55.966 --> 18:58.056
who dances around in sparkly dresses

18:58.057 --> 19:00.562
with smoke billowing around her.

19:00.563 --> 19:02.166
Don't get me wrong. It's fun,

19:02.167 --> 19:04.688
and I wanna give my fans
what they want, but...

19:06.229 --> 19:07.197
What?

19:07.791 --> 19:11.677
What if I decide to walk
away from being that girl...

19:12.885 --> 19:14.419
And nobody comes with me?

19:14.930 --> 19:16.315
What am I supposed to do?

19:16.917 --> 19:20.322
I know it must be real scary
thinkin' about losin' everybody,

19:20.323 --> 19:23.199
but wouldn't it be worse to lose yourself?

19:23.417 --> 19:26.031
Look, Juliette, there's thinkin'
about doin' somethin'...

19:27.592 --> 19:29.448
And there's just doin' it.

19:34.249 --> 19:36.403
It's nice. Thanks. Thanks for the ride.

19:36.404 --> 19:40.167
Well, I mean, 300 yards
is a long way to walk.

19:41.944 --> 19:44.292
I wish you could see what I
can see from right here.

19:45.255 --> 19:46.471
And what's that?

19:46.679 --> 19:50.658
I see a proud, smart, hard-working man

19:50.715 --> 19:52.253
who deserves happiness,

19:52.585 --> 19:54.065
who deserves to have someone tell him

19:54.066 --> 19:55.494
that she believes in him,

19:56.488 --> 19:57.911
that she always has.

20:00.128 --> 20:01.477
You shouldn't have to work so hard

20:01.478 --> 20:02.995
to try to make someone love you.

20:37.648 --> 20:39.951
I'm here with rising star Avery Barkley,

20:39.952 --> 20:42.400
who's taking the alt
country world by storm,

20:42.401 --> 20:44.431
with his new hit single, "kiss."

20:44.943 --> 20:47.997
Today, he's gonna show
us around his Nashville.

20:48.241 --> 20:50.478
Well, this is, uh, my old neighborhood,

20:50.896 --> 20:53.179
and that house is the second place

20:53.180 --> 20:54.765
I ever lived here in town.

20:54.766 --> 20:55.931
You don't live there anymore?

20:56.349 --> 20:59.260
No, no. Time came for me to move on.

20:59.261 --> 21:01.827
But, uh, it was great. It was great.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.172
Best place I ever lived.

21:03.422 --> 21:04.857
Excellent. I think we're good.

21:04.861 --> 21:08.218
So maybe now we can get some
b-roll of Avery walking by.

21:08.315 --> 21:09.738
Sure, yeah. Let's get that.

21:11.262 --> 21:12.313
You're doing great.

21:12.957 --> 21:15.305
Interesting new addition,
swinging by your old house.

21:15.421 --> 21:17.469
Well, I checked the DVDs
out that you gave me,

21:17.470 --> 21:19.019
and it seemed like a pretty standard stop.

21:19.020 --> 21:20.408
Tugs at the heartstrings.

21:21.922 --> 21:23.581
Look like you're reminiscing
about something.

21:23.936 --> 21:26.108
Now look longingly, then back down.

21:27.139 --> 21:29.086
Excellent. Now look up at the house.

21:30.656 --> 21:31.613
Avery?

21:32.396 --> 21:35.690
Uh, this is my ex-girlfriend,
Scarlett O'Connor.

21:35.691 --> 21:39.672
She's an incredible musician,
and we're still great friends.

21:40.732 --> 21:42.359
What on earth is going on here?

21:42.844 --> 21:45.433
I'm, uh, filming a segment
for "star towns."

21:45.434 --> 21:46.937
"Avery Barkley's Nashville."

21:48.204 --> 21:49.134
You wanna point your thingy over there?

21:49.135 --> 21:50.505
I'm not signing any releases.

21:50.845 --> 21:52.987
Come here, please. Go. There.

21:53.135 --> 21:54.462
What... what are you doing?

21:54.463 --> 21:55.666
When I called and asked to talk to you,

21:55.667 --> 21:57.166
I didn't think you'd bring
a camera crew with you.

21:57.167 --> 21:58.671
No, just the timing worked out.

21:58.672 --> 22:00.284
But I mean, it's pretty cool, isn't it?

22:01.456 --> 22:03.308
Fabulous. The reason I called you

22:03.309 --> 22:05.003
is because I need the
money that you owe me.

22:05.088 --> 22:06.124
What are you talking about?

22:06.130 --> 22:08.129
Please don't play dumb with me.
It's very frustrating.

22:08.130 --> 22:09.362
The money that I loaned you

22:09.363 --> 22:10.703
to cover your half of the rent that time.

22:10.704 --> 22:11.872
You havin' troubles this month?

22:11.873 --> 22:13.838
That is none of your business.
You gonna give it to me or not?

22:15.348 --> 22:16.667
Scarlett, you broke up with me.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.857
Mm. And seeing as how you're
the one who lives here now,

22:18.858 --> 22:19.935
I'd say we're even.

22:20.476 --> 22:21.529
Oh, you're pissed off

22:21.530 --> 22:23.787
'cause I'm not impressed by
your little television show?

22:23.788 --> 22:24.761
Is that it?

22:25.436 --> 22:26.248
No.

22:27.399 --> 22:28.550
You're pathetic.

22:47.957 --> 22:48.801
Hey.

22:55.557 --> 22:57.730
Hey, what's going on with Scarlett?

22:58.582 --> 23:00.340
Watty had her demo, and I listened to it.

23:00.341 --> 23:01.842
She is amazing.

23:02.773 --> 23:03.920
Got all your talent.

23:09.620 --> 23:10.672
You having fun on the tour?

23:11.941 --> 23:12.879
Never thought I'd see the day

23:12.880 --> 23:14.240
you'd be singing "boys and buses"

23:14.241 --> 23:15.824
with Juliette Barnes day in and day out,

23:15.825 --> 23:18.108
but, you know, life never ceases to amaze.

23:23.568 --> 23:24.689
Glad we had this chat.

23:28.728 --> 23:31.701
No offense, but, uh, you look awful.

23:32.697 --> 23:34.820
There were shenanigans
at my house last night

23:35.672 --> 23:38.403
that involved an air horn and 3:00 A.M.,

23:38.471 --> 23:39.714
and I'm not happy.

23:41.097 --> 23:42.624
I might have a solution to that problem.

23:42.625 --> 23:45.051
Well, are you gonna take my
roommates out back and shoot 'em?

23:45.330 --> 23:49.316
No, but I am gonna suggest a new one... me.

23:51.079 --> 23:53.081
And I know that look. It
can be a temporary thing,

23:53.082 --> 23:54.601
but you need sleep, and I need a roommate.

23:54.602 --> 23:55.736
We can get somebody else
at the end of the month.

23:55.737 --> 23:56.708
Whatever you want.

23:58.281 --> 23:59.208
I don't know.

23:59.209 --> 24:00.308
There'd be rules.

24:00.664 --> 24:01.447
Rules?

24:02.233 --> 24:04.007
Don't walk around the kitchen naked,

24:04.008 --> 24:05.855
and I won't play the banjo in the shower.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.358
about doing something and
then actually doing it.

25:19.441 --> 25:23.584
So I would like to bring
my new lead guitarist

25:23.585 --> 25:26.064
and good friend up on the stage

25:26.065 --> 25:28.765

that we wrote together.

25:28.896 --> 25:30.028
Deacon Claybourne.

What are you doing? Are
you the one doing this?

31:20.101 --> 31:21.819
What? Filling her head with
the idea that this is what

31:21.820 --> 31:23.400
she should be doing, because it's not.

31:23.514 --> 31:25.580
You know, I-I know that you
and Rayna were a package deal

31:25.581 --> 31:26.953
for all these years. Mm.

31:26.954 --> 31:28.380
Juliette... she's a solo act, okay?

31:28.381 --> 31:29.712
I know that. Yeah, well, then what the hell

31:29.713 --> 31:31.839
was that display out there tonight?
I don't know, Glenn.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.135
It's something she wanted
to try, all right?

31:33.136 --> 31:34.895
What was I supposed to do, leave
her onstage by herself? Ah.

31:34.896 --> 31:36.751
Right? You know, I didn't plan it with her.

31:36.752 --> 31:38.555
She does what she wants.
You should know that.

31:40.144 --> 31:41.692
Is that why you came on this tour...

31:42.047 --> 31:44.219
to turn Juliette into your
replacement for Rayna?

31:44.478 --> 31:45.871
Let me tell you, it really felt like

31:45.872 --> 31:47.344
a rayna/deacon special out there.

31:47.345 --> 31:48.312
All right, you need to watch it, okay?

'Cause you're off base and
you're out of line. Oh...

31:49.993 --> 31:51.639
she's my boss, and as far as I know,

31:51.640 --> 31:53.288
that means I'm supposed
to do what she asks.

31:53.289 --> 31:56.551
Okay, listen. Deacon,
stay in your Lane. Okay?

31:56.552 --> 31:57.747
Stay in my Lane? Yeah, stay in your Lane.

31:57.748 --> 31:59.124
Stay in my Lane. You're not her boyfriend.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.411
You're not her manager.
You're just a hired gun

32:01.412 --> 32:03.261
who's easily replaceable, man.

32:03.520 --> 32:04.640
Tell me how you really feel, Glenn.

32:04.641 --> 32:06.782
Yeah, and you know something?
You don't get to lecture her

32:06.783 --> 32:09.119
about the distinction
between doing and thinking.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.644
You know, all I've ever
seen you do is think.

32:13.935 --> 32:15.440
Whatever crap you got going on with Rayna,

32:15.441 --> 32:17.067
Juliette's not part of your solution.

32:34.616 --> 32:35.844
Can I just ask you something?

32:36.569 --> 32:39.044
What in the hell are you
doing on this tour?

32:40.882 --> 32:41.795

32:48.249 --> 32:50.470
No, I just need to know
what your... what your...

32:50.471 --> 32:52.799
Rayna, I'm done talkin'.

33:27.078 --> 33:28.594
You sure about this? Yeah.

33:29.399 --> 33:31.170
It'll do fine till the rest
of your stuff comes in.

33:33.493 --> 33:35.826
So, uh, what'd this room used to be?

33:36.470 --> 33:39.505
Well, according to my
mama, it was my bedroom.

33:39.813 --> 33:42.197
But, uh, in actual facts,

33:42.198 --> 33:44.241
Avery's guitar storage room.

33:45.127 --> 33:48.081
Your mama really believed you
slept in separate bedrooms?

33:48.773 --> 33:50.831
There's this plausible deniability thing

33:50.832 --> 33:51.772
that happens in my family.

33:51.773 --> 33:53.066
As long as you pretend
everything's good and proper,

33:53.067 --> 33:54.088
it's fine.

33:55.196 --> 33:56.584
Agreed-upon delusion.

33:57.645 --> 33:58.617
I'll remember that.

33:59.261 --> 34:00.632
Well, roommate problem solved.

34:00.844 --> 34:02.848
You can go back to being
your usual fun self.

34:04.133 --> 34:05.089
Try my best.

34:13.844 --> 34:14.880
What are you doing here?

34:16.741 --> 34:18.063
I came to make peace.

34:27.572 --> 34:29.090
I was being a jerk.

34:29.112 --> 34:32.289
And I'm sorry for giving
you crap about the money.

34:37.040 --> 34:39.964
Look, I know we didn't end so well,

34:40.704 --> 34:43.583
and I'll admit I did bring that TV crew by

34:43.585 --> 34:45.420
because I wanted you to see them.

34:46.722 --> 34:49.149
I just... I don't know.

34:50.321 --> 34:52.065
I... I guess I wanted to share

34:52.065 --> 34:53.594
a little of my success with you.

34:56.994 --> 34:58.815
I was just hoping we
could still be friends,

34:58.816 --> 34:59.805
that's all.

35:01.121 --> 35:03.212
I miss having you in my life, Scarlett.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.245
Hi.

35:06.490 --> 35:07.334
Hey.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.042
Uh, didn't realize you were here.

35:12.167 --> 35:13.652
It's kinda late to be working, isn't it?

35:13.735 --> 35:14.720
We're not working.

35:15.735 --> 35:16.611
Oh.

35:18.614 --> 35:19.650
I get it.

35:20.903 --> 35:22.482
Don't smirk at her like that.

35:22.759 --> 35:24.422
I always knew it was just a matter of time

35:24.423 --> 35:25.651
before you moved in on her.

35:26.743 --> 35:28.200
How long have you been
sleeping with him, huh?

35:28.201 --> 35:29.912
Oh. You know, you're real good

35:29.913 --> 35:31.173
at jumping to conclusions.

35:31.258 --> 35:33.858
Well, first you take my
band, now you're moving in

35:33.859 --> 35:36.368
on my woman. I'm not your woman.

35:36.883 --> 35:37.824
Oh, that's all right.

35:38.435 --> 35:40.351
You just remember who had her first.

35:40.419 --> 35:43.138
You're lonely, and you hate yourself

35:43.139 --> 35:45.458
ever since you took up with
Marilyn, and that's fine.

35:46.941 --> 35:49.577
But you made your choices, and
you have to live with them.

35:49.902 --> 35:52.379
So don't disrespect Scarlett like that.

35:53.406 --> 35:55.642
'Cause you didn't ever deserve her.

35:57.060 --> 35:58.372
Uhh! Aah!

36:01.754 --> 36:03.062
We're not sleeping together!

36:04.937 --> 36:06.117
I'm her new roommate.

36:09.233 --> 36:10.273
Get out of our house.

36:35.400 --> 36:36.327
Juliette?

36:37.895 --> 36:40.693
God, I really need a moment alone, please.

36:41.753 --> 36:42.580
What?

36:46.712 --> 36:48.807
I know I'm just your assistant,

36:48.808 --> 36:52.338
so my opinion doesn't count for
much of anything around here,

36:52.455 --> 36:56.517
but... I wanted to say that

36:57.179 --> 36:59.144
I loved your song,

36:59.421 --> 37:01.353
and I love that you were
brave enough to do it.

37:08.541 --> 37:09.639
Thank you.

37:11.781 --> 37:13.037
Have you just been torturing yourself

37:13.038 --> 37:14.072
with those tweets?

37:18.684 --> 37:19.528
Here.

37:21.791 --> 37:23.017
Try this instead.

37:28.793 --> 37:31.974
It's been viewed almost 100,000 times,

37:32.440 --> 37:34.298
and it has nearly that many "likes."

37:36.289 --> 37:38.221
But that was just posted two hours ago.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.029
Most people love it as much as I do.

Hi.

38:55.575 --> 38:56.627
Hi.

39:04.514 --> 39:06.641
What are you doing in Chicago?
Where are the girls?

39:06.642 --> 39:08.287
They're fine. They're with Tandy.

39:08.964 --> 39:11.262
I just had this moment of clarity, and I...

39:11.363 --> 39:12.418
I needed to see you.

39:31.940 --> 39:32.880
Can I come in?

39:33.637 --> 39:34.608
Yeah.

39:43.717 --> 39:45.220
I'm glad the response from the world

39:45.221 --> 39:47.026
has been so positive, but...

39:47.027 --> 39:48.819
listen, we need to go back into the album,

39:48.820 --> 39:50.436
we need to put "consider me," "undermine,"

39:50.437 --> 39:51.541
songs like that on it.

39:51.542 --> 39:53.296
Your brand is not the same
as everybody else's...

39:53.297 --> 39:55.666
my brand is gonna have to
develop and change with me.

39:55.667 --> 39:58.114
You can't just change
who you are on a whim.

39:58.115 --> 40:00.851
I have stolen nail Polish. I
have left a man at the altar.

40:00.852 --> 40:02.832
Everybody in the world
knows about my mother.

40:02.833 --> 40:05.329
I cannot keep trying to play this role

40:05.330 --> 40:07.027
that I was playing before.
I'm not gonna try.

40:07.028 --> 40:09.312
All right, look, you pay me
to give you good counsel.

40:09.313 --> 40:10.190
Listen to me.

40:11.971 --> 40:13.246
You were great.

40:15.010 --> 40:16.157
But it was one song.

40:17.058 --> 40:19.058
You're walking a very high wire right now.

40:19.059 --> 40:20.990
I just don't wanna see you fall.

40:21.139 --> 40:23.870
And I appreciate that, but I'm growing up.

40:24.179 --> 40:26.830
And apparently my audience
is willing to grow with me.

40:27.843 --> 40:29.727
So I suggest you try to do the same.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.038
Where'd you learn to fight like that?

40:33.971 --> 40:34.975
From my brother.

40:36.034 --> 40:37.295
The one who just got out of prison?

40:38.690 --> 40:39.775
Mm-hmm.

40:40.547 --> 40:43.569
Guess we weren't always model citizens

40:43.570 --> 40:44.622
when we were younger.

40:45.778 --> 40:47.251
Not always a good guy, huh?

40:47.474 --> 40:48.428
Not always.

40:50.065 --> 40:51.405
You got a problem with that?

41:03.410 --> 41:04.145
What happened?

41:04.146 --> 41:05.118
Don't worry about it.

41:06.904 --> 41:07.581
Let me see...

41:07.582 --> 41:08.875
I said don't worry about it.

41:11.679 --> 41:14.189
I'm not doing this anymore.
You're not my damn girlfriend.

41:14.190 --> 41:17.406
Don't flatter yourself. This
is purely recreational.

41:17.407 --> 41:19.774
We are both using each other
to get ahead, and you know it,

41:19.775 --> 41:21.533
so don't suddenly act like
you're a babe in the woods.

41:21.534 --> 41:22.989
We're keeping this
professional from now on.

41:22.990 --> 41:24.864
You wanna drop me as a client? Drop me.

41:25.887 --> 41:27.515
There has to be a better way than this.

41:34.010 --> 41:36.998
Yeah, it... things for
both of us have been...

41:38.044 --> 41:40.070
Been pretty tough lately.

41:40.907 --> 41:43.334
You know, I mean, especially
the past few weeks.

41:44.187 --> 41:46.040
And I know you didn't
want me to run for mayor,

41:46.041 --> 41:47.311
and I sure as hell didn't want you

41:47.312 --> 41:48.783
to come back out on the road.

41:50.338 --> 41:52.828
And then all the fighting and
the frustration is just...

41:52.829 --> 41:53.915
yeah, Teddy, I...

41:53.916 --> 41:55.889
let me... let me get this out.

41:55.890 --> 41:57.566
Okay. Thanks.

41:59.010 --> 42:01.276
You know, I've kept hoping
that things would change,

42:02.097 --> 42:05.966
that there would somehow
be this... I don't know...

42:07.137 --> 42:10.027
magical moment where things
would just get better.

42:10.353 --> 42:11.820
You know, where you look at me

42:12.993 --> 42:14.093
and just love me.

42:16.753 --> 42:21.182
But the reality is, Rayna,
that that hasn't changed.

42:21.233 --> 42:23.183
And I'm tired of waiting to see if it does.

42:29.234 --> 42:30.765
I want a divorce.
