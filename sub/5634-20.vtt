WEBVTT

00:50.801 --> 00:51.802
What are you doing over there?

00:51.885 --> 00:53.303
I'm on hold with tech support.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.056
My computer locked up right in the middle
of this story I'm working on.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.350
God, even Microsoft Word
hates your writing.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.477
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for holding. How can I help you?</i>

01:00.561 --> 01:03.605
Well, for starters, you can keep
talking with that lovely accent.

01:03.689 --> 01:06.567
Amazing. One second
of a stranger's voice on a phone

01:06.650 --> 01:08.694
and you've got full Bollywood.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.904
I... I assume she's in India.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.030
<i>Your friend is correct.</i>

01:12.114 --> 01:13.115
<i>I am in India.</i>

01:13.198 --> 01:15.576
<i>But you sound like</i>
<i>a perfect gentleman to me.</i>

01:15.659 --> 01:16.869
<i>My name is Padma.</i>

01:16.952 --> 01:18.871
Padma. That was my mother's name.

01:18.954 --> 01:20.873
I'm gonna get an English muffin.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.624
<i>So what seems to be the problem?</i>

01:22.708 --> 01:24.084
Well, one problem I have

01:24.168 --> 01:25.878
is that I have too much money.

01:25.961 --> 01:28.005
<i>Then why don't you just</i>
<i>buy a new computer?</i>

01:28.088 --> 01:29.173
What? I-I...

01:29.256 --> 01:31.300
<i>Oh, I'm just</i>
<i>bursting your balls.</i>

01:31.383 --> 01:32.801
Oh!

01:32.885 --> 01:34.803
Well, you're a feisty one.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.430
Uh, actually, my computer froze

01:36.513 --> 01:37.973
right in the middle of a story
I'm writing.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.516
<i>Oh, you are a writer?</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:40.601
<i>Are you famous?</i>

01:40.684 --> 01:42.144
By choice, no. No.

01:42.227 --> 01:44.479
Sometimes fame brings
a lot of unwanted attention.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.231
I mean, look at William Shakespeare.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.233
- William Shakespeare.
- Aye.

01:48.317 --> 01:49.651
Nice collar, you fruit.

01:49.735 --> 01:50.736
Thank ye.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.363
Hey, Shakespeare.
What's the title of your next play?

01:53.447 --> 01:56.074
You should call it <i>Homosexual Collar Guy.</i>

01:56.158 --> 01:58.952
Ah, thy japes and jabs cut me
to the quick, squire.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.204
What does that even mean?

02:00.287 --> 02:02.789
I know. It means,
"I use this collar as a bib

02:02.915 --> 02:04.333
"for when I service guys."

02:04.458 --> 02:06.293
Thank ye, thank ye.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.172
So, how'd you like the collar?

02:10.255 --> 02:11.757
'Tis not for me.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.265
Huh, there's no one there.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.850
Must have been some kids knocking.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.101
Down here, Lois.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.229
Oh, for God's sake, Joe.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.023
Can't you put a tall flag on the
back of your chair or something?

02:28.106 --> 02:31.777
I apologize for the difficulty
my paralysis causes you.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.529
Hey, Peter. Good news.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.739
Bonnie's out of town,
so I have an extra ticket

02:35.822 --> 02:38.742
for Tuesday night bingo
down at the Allendale Mill.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.369
Why the hell would I
want to go to bingo?

02:40.452 --> 02:41.662
Oh, it's a blast.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.456
There's the thrill of the game,
people bring snacks,

02:44.540 --> 02:46.750
plus you'll hear some
pretty unfiltered opinions

02:46.834 --> 02:48.919
about those jokers in Washington.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.921
Yeah, that sounds perfectly terrible.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.047
You know what, Joe?

02:52.130 --> 02:53.882
Peter would love to go with you.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.008
- What?
- Terrific.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.552
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.178
What'd you do that for?

02:58.262 --> 02:59.805
Peter, he's your friend.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.974
Who knows? It might be fun.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.725
All right, I'll go.

03:03.809 --> 03:04.810
But I'm not happy.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.104
You know how much I hate
being told what to do.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.576
You know, Padma, I love Indian food.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.537
But I'd have to say my least
favorite curry is Ann.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.832
She's... She's a newscaster here.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.834
I... I wish I could have
slipped that in earlier.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.085
<i> Oh, no, I know her.</i>

03:30.169 --> 03:32.129
<i>She's internationally despised.</i>

03:32.212 --> 03:34.047
<i>So, are you done rebooting?</i>

03:34.131 --> 03:36.341
Look, uh,
I have to come clean.

03:36.425 --> 03:39.845
Um, my computer wasn't
actually broken this time.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.014
Uh, I just wanted
to talk to you again.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.974
<i>I like talking to you, too, Brian.</i>

03:44.057 --> 03:46.310
Oh, hey, is that Padma
from tech support again?

03:46.393 --> 03:47.394
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.188
Oh, cool. Ask her a question for me.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.315
How come over there
they just talk on the phone,

03:51.398 --> 03:52.900
and over here they're all doctors?

03:52.983 --> 03:54.318
Get out of here. Lois said you're supposed

03:54.401 --> 03:56.153
to sit on the potty for one hour straight.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.863
I'm taking a break. I got bored.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.781
And you've been on the phone
for more than an hour.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.241
I'm sorry. Can you give me a sec?

04:01.325 --> 04:02.409
Look, I know it's crazy,

04:02.492 --> 04:04.578
but I honestly feel
a connection to this woman.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.663
More than I have to anyone in a long time.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.041
That's nice, Brian,
but you're from different worlds.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.126
She's in India. That's a lot to overcome.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.045
People in love can overcome anything.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.296
I guess you're right.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.507
I mean, look at Jeb Bush and his wife.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.134
Honey, do you think
I'll ever be president?

04:19.218 --> 04:22.262
No, no, no.

04:22.346 --> 04:23.347
Stewie!

04:23.430 --> 04:24.515
What? It's just a joke.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.766
Yeah, but come on.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.017
Look it up, man. Google her.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.727
I know what she looks like.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.194
Oh, I see you came with the Big Cheese.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.196
What? You?

04:39.279 --> 04:40.447
You're the Big Cheese?

04:40.531 --> 04:42.074
I usually bring a variety wheel

04:42.157 --> 04:43.659
of Laughing Cow cheese.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.953
Laughing Cow!

04:46.036 --> 04:47.913
That's got to be a happy farm, right?

04:49.665 --> 04:52.042
Oh, you just must be
cracking up all the time

04:52.125 --> 04:53.418
hanging out with this one.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.712
Look, ma'am, I don't know
what signals Joe is sending out,

04:55.796 --> 04:56.797
but I'm married.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.466
G-49.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.219
Hey, and you're already on the board.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.679
You're a natural at this.

05:03.762 --> 05:07.099
Oh, and fair warning when they call O-69,

05:07.182 --> 05:11.103
I say, "Oh, my! Ooh-la-la!"

05:12.771 --> 05:13.772
Yeah, really funny, Joe.

05:13.856 --> 05:15.107
Or-or how about this one?

05:15.190 --> 05:18.360
"Oh... My God, I want to
kill myself right now."

05:18.443 --> 05:19.653
All right, I got to get through this.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.321
I'm just gonna go to my happy place.

05:21.405 --> 05:23.031
Go to your happy place, Peter.

05:25.409 --> 05:28.370
<i>Oh, and you're wearing</i>
<i>the necklace I gave you.</i>

05:29.663 --> 05:31.707
Well, if I were you, I'd sure be excited.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.126
You're only one number away
from having a bingo.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.128
I am? What, you mean if they call...

05:36.211 --> 05:38.213
O-74.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.759
- Bingo!

05:43.218 --> 05:45.137
You were right, Joe, this is awesome.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.471
I've never won anything.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.016
Well, except for when I won
that "Tori Spelling Bee."

05:49.099 --> 05:52.603
Peter, your word is "equine."

05:52.686 --> 05:55.189
Peter reached this
round by accurately spelling

05:55.272 --> 05:58.734
"collagen," "repulsive" and "botched."

06:02.654 --> 06:04.156
God, I can't believe
you're still at work, Padma.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.449
It's, like, 2:00 in the morning.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.825
<i>No, it is noon here.</i>

06:06.909 --> 06:08.410
<i>Do you not know about time zones?</i>

06:08.493 --> 06:09.912
Oh, uh, yeah, oh, that's right.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.246
You guys are on metric.

06:11.955 --> 06:12.956
Oh, you're in here?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.166
Yeah, I'm on the phone.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.251
Is, uh, is Chris down in the laundry room?

06:16.335 --> 06:17.336
Yeah, I think so.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.087
Okay, looks like this is gonna be

06:19.171 --> 06:20.964
a stander-upper in the garage.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.966
Uh-oh, six percent. Better hustle.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.177
<i>It's so nice to talk to you, Brian.</i>

06:25.260 --> 06:26.720
<i>You make me feel wonderful.</i>

06:26.803 --> 06:28.680
God, if only you weren't so far away.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.933
I wish I could just somehow
magically appear there

06:31.016 --> 06:32.142
and meet you in person.

06:32.226 --> 06:34.770
<i>Oh, Brian, that would be like a dream.</i>

06:34.853 --> 06:35.896
<i>Okay, I should go.</i>

06:35.979 --> 06:37.856
<i>I have 11,000 people on hold.</i>

06:37.940 --> 06:39.233
Good-bye, Padma.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.734
What the hell's going on?

06:40.817 --> 06:42.486
Somebody's screaming in the garage.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.654
Why are you still up?

06:43.737 --> 06:44.821
Because I'm in love.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.114
Oh, with that Indian chick?

06:46.198 --> 06:47.324
What was her name? Dot?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.368
No, it's not Dot, it's Padma.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.827
And I have to be with her.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.330
Stewie, I'm going to India.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.165
Oh, my God, I'm going with you.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.543
My yoga class will be so jealous.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.462
Hey, everyone, the guy
I told you about, Brian,

07:00.546 --> 07:02.297
he's taking me to India!

07:02.381 --> 07:05.300
- Oh, my God!

07:25.237 --> 07:26.572
We finally made it, Brian.

07:26.655 --> 07:27.865
We're in India.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.575
Excuse me, man with no pupil,

07:29.658 --> 07:31.869
where can we get
a taxicab around here?

07:32.452 --> 07:33.912
All right, let's do it, Stewie.

07:33.996 --> 07:35.080
Let's go find Padma.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.708
Shouldn't be hard
in this dreamy land of wonder.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.586
I can already smell
the enlightenment and tranquility.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.720
This is wonderful, isn't it, Brian?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.722
It's so tranquil, I'm tearing up.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.892
Come on, I think I see a cab
with less than nine people in it.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.982
All right, it's winning time.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.442
Let's get this show on the road.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.319
After all, it's not called "bing-stop,"

08:05.402 --> 08:07.070
it's called "bing-go!"

08:08.322 --> 08:09.615
That's very clever.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.450
Yeah, and, uh... Uh, maybe if I win,

08:11.533 --> 08:13.452
I'll yell, "bing-Joe."

08:13.535 --> 08:14.786
Don't force it, Joe.

08:14.870 --> 08:15.871
Yeah, be quiet, Joe.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.247
Me and the gang are trying
to hear our numbers.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.582
"You" and the gang?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.083
I'm the one who brought you here.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.168
Yeah, well, you know something?

08:21.251 --> 08:22.794
The <i>Mayflower</i> also brought fungus,

08:22.878 --> 08:24.463
which then became the Potato Famine.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.048
What the hell are you talking about?

08:26.131 --> 08:27.549
I don't know, I've had, like,
four Ensures.

08:27.633 --> 08:28.634
I'm out of my mind.

08:28.717 --> 08:31.637
Peter, I brought you here
to have fun, not take over.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.347
Look, Joe, I'm a little busy right now,

08:33.430 --> 08:35.599
so I'm gonna have the Somali
pirate from <i>Captain Phillips</i>

08:35.682 --> 08:36.975
tell you something.

08:37.059 --> 08:38.936
Joe, look at me.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.437
Look at me.

08:40.521 --> 08:42.356
He is the bingo captain now.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.075
I tell you, I love it here, Brian.

08:53.158 --> 08:54.451
The sounds, the colors.

08:54.535 --> 08:56.995
You know, this is where the Beatles came
to ruin their music.

08:57.079 --> 08:58.080
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.748
Anyway, Padma works in Bangalore,

08:59.831 --> 09:01.208
so we got to hurry and catch the train.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.460
Can't believe
we're really in India.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.504
Oh, look over there.
There's cute little kids are playing

09:05.587 --> 09:07.130
Cowboys and Indians and Indians.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.132
I'm gonna shoot you with my six-gun.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.009
I'm gonna shoot you
with my bow and arrow.

09:11.093 --> 09:14.304
I'm just going to stand here wearing
a shirt that appears to be a jacket.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.565
Do you think all those chickens
had to buy tickets?

09:24.648 --> 09:26.024
I don't know, but I'm starving.

09:26.108 --> 09:28.861
What I wouldn't give right now
for a big juicy steak.

09:28.944 --> 09:29.945
How dare you?

09:30.028 --> 09:31.697
To us, cows are sacred!

09:31.780 --> 09:34.950
That's right, you are disrespecting
our entire culture.

09:35.033 --> 09:38.120
And why did Wes Anderson come
here to make his worst movie?

09:38.203 --> 09:40.455
- Stewie, what do we do?
- Quick, hit the red buttons!

09:45.502 --> 09:47.129
- Wow, that came in handy.
- Yeah.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.881
- Now let's get out of here.
- Let's see what their wieners look like.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.340
Yeah. Yeah, no, let's get out of here.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.013
Okay, I'm off to bingo.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.306
Peter, what are you wearing?

09:57.389 --> 09:58.891
Oh, you mean my bingo cape?

09:58.974 --> 10:00.767
That's our holiday tablecloth.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.936
I'm sorry, Lois, but my people
have come to expect

10:03.020 --> 10:04.938
a certain degree of pageantry.

10:05.022 --> 10:06.356
Don't wait up.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.608
We may go to Denny's.

10:07.691 --> 10:08.984
Is Joe going with you?

10:09.067 --> 10:10.402
Oh, "Crybaby Joe"?

10:10.485 --> 10:11.737
Nah, he doesn't come anymore.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.280
I think he resents my skill.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.741
Peter, bingo was Joe's favorite thing.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.451
Now, you go over there
and take him with you,

10:17.534 --> 10:18.994
or I don't want you going at all.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.913
Hey, hey, hey, don't try
to take this away from me.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.623
This is the only thing
I've ever been good at.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.459
Well, this and timing my farts
to a thunderstorm.

10:25.542 --> 10:28.003
Why don't we all go ahead
and turn to page six in the handout?

10:28.086 --> 10:29.671
- Ah...

10:29.755 --> 10:31.924
The first thing you're gonna notice
is a bar graph.

10:32.007 --> 10:35.177
And what that is is to indicate
our international sales...

10:36.345 --> 10:37.387
- ...which peaked, of course...
- Oh, yeah.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.349
...during the last quarter. But now
we're expecting that to drop off

10:40.432 --> 10:42.184
as we enter the colder weather.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.523
The storm's moving away.

10:52.945 --> 10:55.030
We made it! This is where Padma works!

10:55.113 --> 10:58.534
I feel like I owe every bus
in America an apology.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.664
So, we haven't discussed
what you're going to do if she's a pig.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.165
She's already beautiful to me.

11:05.249 --> 11:07.626
And, you know, we'll see.

11:16.802 --> 11:18.470
My God, how you gonna find her?

11:18.554 --> 11:19.888
There are hundreds of people in here.

11:19.972 --> 11:21.598
Don't worry, I thought of that.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.851
<i>Thank you for calling tech support.</i>

11:23.934 --> 11:24.935
<i>How can I help you?</i>

11:25.018 --> 11:26.144
I'll tell you how.

11:26.228 --> 11:27.354
Stand on your desk.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.356
<i>- Brian?</i>
- Padma, just do it.

11:31.692 --> 11:32.776
Oh, boy.

11:32.860 --> 11:33.861
Are you Padma?

11:33.944 --> 11:35.779
No, I am Ranita.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.781
There is a python in my cube.

11:40.284 --> 11:41.285
Brian?

11:41.368 --> 11:42.452
Padma!

11:42.536 --> 11:43.704
I can't believe this!

11:43.787 --> 11:44.913
Why are you here?

11:44.997 --> 11:47.416
Because I was having a technical issue

11:47.499 --> 11:48.750
with my heart.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.419
Ugh, 16 hours on a plane,

11:50.502 --> 11:52.004
and that's what you came up with?

11:52.087 --> 11:54.923
I am touched you came
all this way to see me.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.758
I'm so glad I did.

11:56.842 --> 11:59.011
You're even more beautiful
than I imagined.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.974
Well, I have to admit
you two do make a cute couple.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.935
But then again,
so did Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow.

12:07.019 --> 12:10.147
Do you take this woman to lecture you
about trans fats

12:10.230 --> 12:11.899
for as long as you both shall live?

12:11.982 --> 12:14.484
- I do.
- And do you take this man to be

12:14.568 --> 12:17.154
a watered-down Bono
until death do you part?

12:17.237 --> 12:18.238
I do.

12:18.322 --> 12:20.741
I now pronounce you
pretentious and terrible.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.202
You may name your daughter
after a fruit.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.667
So, this is my town.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.294
I have lived here my whole life.

12:32.377 --> 12:35.172
Well, if you were born here,
then it must be a magical place.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.590
Yes, let's go get sandwiches

12:36.673 --> 12:39.134
at that New Delhi I keep hearing about.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.846
Thanks, Ganesha.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.973
I am so happy that you are here.

12:45.057 --> 12:48.101
In fact, my family is
having a big party tonight.

12:48.185 --> 12:50.020
You must both come as my guests.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.772
Oh, an Indian party!

12:51.855 --> 12:54.191
I hope they play that one song
with the shrieking, nasal,

12:54.274 --> 12:57.194
atonal woman over the bongos
and tambourines.

13:05.827 --> 13:06.828
You seem nervous.

13:06.912 --> 13:08.705
Are you worried
about meeting Padma's family?

13:08.789 --> 13:11.124
Yeah. Well, that, and this is always

13:11.208 --> 13:12.334
what it looks like on <i>Homeland</i>

13:12.417 --> 13:14.127
right before there's a drone strike.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.797
Oh, my, you both look so elegant.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.715
Thanks, I did a little shopping today.

13:18.799 --> 13:22.219
Not me. Mine is actually
an Aladdin costume from last Halloween.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.804
I never travel without it.

13:25.764 --> 13:26.932
Family, guests,

13:27.015 --> 13:29.893
and monkeys who have
wandered in to steal fruit,

13:29.977 --> 13:33.355
it is my honor to welcome you
to this engagement celebration.

13:33.438 --> 13:34.731
Oh, "engagement"?

13:34.815 --> 13:36.358
So, who's getting married?

13:36.441 --> 13:38.360
- I am.
- What?

13:38.902 --> 13:40.696
Padma, my beloved daughter.

13:40.779 --> 13:42.739
Dhiraj, my future son-in-law.

13:42.823 --> 13:45.158
Please, come and meet one another.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.286
Welp, that's a Punjab to the figs.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.579
Where's the bar?

13:50.372 --> 13:52.833
Everyone, you are all
so kind to come tonight,

13:52.916 --> 13:55.169
and it is so nice to meet you, Dhiraj.

13:55.252 --> 13:58.881
But something happened today,
and I can no longer marry you.

13:59.214 --> 14:00.507
Padma, what is it?

14:00.591 --> 14:02.301
My true love is here tonight.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.636
He has come to me
all the way from America.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.264
His name is Brian Griffin.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.266
And my heart belongs to him.

14:12.561 --> 14:13.979
Quick, everyone's looking at the dog!

14:14.062 --> 14:15.272
Go, go, go!

14:22.487 --> 14:24.656
Padma, you cannot call off the wedding!

14:24.740 --> 14:27.784
I have already paid a large dowry
to Dhiraj's family!

14:27.868 --> 14:30.412
But it would be wrong
to marry someone I do not love.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.706
The one I love is Brian.

14:32.789 --> 14:35.751
Sir, what if I were to repay you
for all you've spent?

14:35.834 --> 14:38.086
Would Padma then be free
to marry whoever she wanted?

14:38.170 --> 14:40.464
Brian! You would do that?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.758
Yes. I love you, Padma,

14:42.841 --> 14:44.593
and-and I'd do anything to be with you.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.762
I suppose that might be possible.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.847
Great, just give me
a chance to raise the money,

14:48.931 --> 14:50.766
so I can marry your daughter
and make her happy.

14:50.849 --> 14:53.477
Oh, so you don't have the money?

14:53.560 --> 14:56.939
He's holding onto an Applebee's
gift card with $1.62 on it.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.899
I do not know Applebee's.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.859
Is it like our Colonel Chutney's?

15:00.943 --> 15:02.528
Does Colonel Chutney's make you sick?

15:02.611 --> 15:03.612
Not every time.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.405
Then, no, it's very different.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.495
I mean, my wife and I
have never said the words

15:11.578 --> 15:12.913
"open marriage," but...

15:12.996 --> 15:14.081
Oh, hey, Lois!

15:14.164 --> 15:15.707
Peter, it's time to come home

15:15.791 --> 15:18.418
and give Joe back
his stupid little activity.

15:18.502 --> 15:20.128
I appreciate that, Lois.

15:20.212 --> 15:23.215
First of all, this is my favorite thing
in the world now, so no.

15:23.298 --> 15:25.133
And second of all,
we're about to play a new round,

15:25.217 --> 15:26.343
so start taking your pants off,

15:26.426 --> 15:27.719
'cause when I win, I want you ready.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.513
Peter, if it wasn't for Joe,

15:29.596 --> 15:31.557
you wouldn't know about bingo anyway.

15:31.640 --> 15:35.102
This meant everything to him,
and you've taken it away.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.020
As a friend, do the right thing

15:37.104 --> 15:39.606
and give Joe back
the happiness he found here.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.032
Joe, gag on my fat dauber.

15:50.659 --> 15:52.369
Damn it, I didn't want to have to do this,

15:52.452 --> 15:53.996
but you've left me no choice!

15:54.079 --> 15:55.539
Kids, get in here!

15:55.622 --> 15:57.666
Yay! Time with Dad!

15:57.749 --> 15:59.585
That's a bingo for me!

16:00.169 --> 16:01.920
All right, how do you play?

16:02.004 --> 16:03.422
"Free space"?

16:03.505 --> 16:05.299
Wow! What's that about?

16:05.382 --> 16:07.301
I call I sit next to Dad!

16:07.384 --> 16:09.136
All right, forget this.

16:09.219 --> 16:12.306
Let's all go home and each do
our own individual media things.

16:18.562 --> 16:20.397
Stewie, I don't think this is gonna work.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.983
We're never gonna raise enough money
to pay back Padma's father.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.943
Trust me, Brian,
there are a billion people here,

16:25.027 --> 16:27.237
and almost every one of them
has a tapeworm.

16:27.321 --> 16:29.198
Yes, excuse me, I have a tapeworm.

16:29.281 --> 16:31.074
All right, very good.
Lie down on your stomach.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.367
This won't hurt a bit.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.168
Hey, how are you guys?

16:41.251 --> 16:42.252
Oh, you're a lady.

16:42.336 --> 16:43.545
And you sound American.

16:43.629 --> 16:44.713
How long have you been in there?

16:44.796 --> 16:47.132
I originally just came for my junior year,

16:47.216 --> 16:49.426
but I fell in love with the place.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.095
Stewie, there's no way
I'm sitting here all day

16:52.179 --> 16:53.805
watching tapeworms come out of butts.

16:53.889 --> 16:55.766
I'm doomed.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.893
I'll never be able
to pay for Padma's dowry.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.144
I don't understand.

16:59.228 --> 17:01.813
In movies, everything in India
always turns out great.

17:01.897 --> 17:04.858
Julia Roberts ate or loved
or prayed or something.

17:04.942 --> 17:06.026
I don't, I don't know. I didn't see it.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.152
Wait a minute!

17:07.236 --> 17:08.946
Movies about India.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.198
I know how I can make the money!

17:13.242 --> 17:15.202
Who wants to be

17:15.285 --> 17:17.162
a millionaire?

17:19.456 --> 17:22.751
Our next contestant comes
all the way from America!

17:22.835 --> 17:25.128
- Brian Griffin!

17:25.712 --> 17:27.047
What brings you to India, Brian?

17:27.130 --> 17:28.632
I'll tell you what brought me.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.716
True love.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.301
He's breaking up a marriage!

17:31.385 --> 17:35.055
- All right, let's get started.

17:35.138 --> 17:38.058
First question,
"Which retired Indian cricketer

17:38.141 --> 17:42.145
"has scored over 18,000 runs
in ODI competition?"

17:42.229 --> 17:44.648
Um, O...? Wha...?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.149
O-ODI? What?

17:46.233 --> 17:48.735
Is it A, Anil Kumble,

17:49.278 --> 17:51.613
B, Mahendra Singh Dhoni,

17:51.989 --> 17:54.616
C, Sachin Tendulkar,

17:54.700 --> 17:56.785
or D, Jiminy Cricket?

17:57.160 --> 18:00.330
Well, I know,
I know it's not Jiminy Cricket.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.041
Unless Jiminy's
based on a real person.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.251
I need an answer.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.712
You know, the more I say it,
the more it does sound Indian.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.338
Jiminy Cricket.

18:08.422 --> 18:10.382
D, Jiminy Cricket, final answer.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.804
I'm sorry, that is incorrect.

18:15.888 --> 18:16.889
Thank you for playing!

18:16.972 --> 18:18.390
We'll be right back

18:18.473 --> 18:20.893
after this message
from the Indian Census Bureau.

18:20.976 --> 18:22.102
Too many people!

18:22.186 --> 18:23.812
Stop with the people!

18:27.566 --> 18:28.650
Padma, I'm sorry.

18:28.734 --> 18:29.943
I still haven't raised the money.

18:30.027 --> 18:31.028
But I'm working on it.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.571
There is no longer a need.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.198
My father has solved the problem

18:34.281 --> 18:36.909
by promising Dhiraj
the hand of my younger sister.

18:36.992 --> 18:39.036
Oh, Padma, I meant
to ask you, are there, like,

18:39.119 --> 18:41.413
Bengal tigers just running loose
in the cities?

18:41.496 --> 18:42.497
I don't know.

18:42.581 --> 18:45.667
In America, are there annoying
talking babies always interrupting?

18:45.751 --> 18:47.669
Okay, it's been a long trip.

18:47.753 --> 18:49.755
Let's not say anything we're gonna regret.

18:49.838 --> 18:52.508
Wait a minute, so if,
if Dhiraj is marrying

18:52.591 --> 18:54.801
your sister, that means
we can be together!

18:54.885 --> 18:56.762
Actually, about that.

18:56.845 --> 18:59.473
I think watching you try to answer
that question out there,

18:59.556 --> 19:00.766
I realized something.

19:00.849 --> 19:03.143
You know nothing
of my country or my culture.

19:03.227 --> 19:05.395
Well, tha-that was a
really tough question.

19:05.479 --> 19:06.647
No, it wasn't.

19:06.730 --> 19:09.983
Everyone in India knows
who Sachin Tendulkar is.

19:10.067 --> 19:13.070
Brian, I am deeply touched
that you came all this way

19:13.153 --> 19:15.572
to find me,
but the truth is, you and I

19:15.656 --> 19:16.990
have very little in common.

19:17.074 --> 19:19.535
Well, I could learn!
I mean, I mean, there's got to be

19:19.618 --> 19:22.287
an old <i>Carmen Sandiego</i> episode
on India or something.

19:22.371 --> 19:24.456
Brian, Brian, punt, punt.

19:24.540 --> 19:26.208
I know you would try, Brian.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.085
But when I look inside myself,

19:28.168 --> 19:30.337
I realize I do not want to marry you.

19:30.420 --> 19:33.423
Mostly, I just did not want
to marry Dhiraj.

19:33.507 --> 19:35.008
I am so sorry.

19:35.092 --> 19:37.553
Have I answered all of your questions
to your satisfaction?

19:37.636 --> 19:40.138
No! I came halfway
around the world for you!

19:40.222 --> 19:41.473
You said I was your true love!

19:41.557 --> 19:43.308
Well, by coming here,

19:43.392 --> 19:46.186
you saved me
from a lifetime of unhappiness.

19:46.270 --> 19:48.397
And I will always love you for that.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.274
Good-bye, Brian.

19:53.151 --> 19:54.736
A peck on the cheek?

19:54.820 --> 19:57.322
Was that worth an $8,000 coach ticket?

19:57.406 --> 19:58.407
You know what?

19:58.490 --> 20:00.450
It's about the journey,
not the destination.

20:00.534 --> 20:01.535
No, it's not.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.120
This sucked and you failed.

20:03.495 --> 20:05.414
Story over! Bollywood!

20:10.586 --> 20:13.755
<i>When you least expect</i>
<i>You'll</i><i>find magic in your life</i>

20:14.089 --> 20:15.924
What the...? What the hell is this?

20:16.008 --> 20:17.467
Oh, in India it's traditional

20:17.551 --> 20:20.387
to do a final musical curtain call
over the end credits.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.850
<i>Brian came so far</i>
<i>But he never found a wife</i>

20:24.933 --> 20:26.351
<i>Ho-ho</i>

20:26.768 --> 20:27.853
<i>Big show</i>

20:28.478 --> 20:29.688
<i>Ho-ho</i>

20:30.397 --> 20:31.523
<i>Time to go</i>

20:31.857 --> 20:32.941
This is kind of weird.

20:33.025 --> 20:35.152
Come on, Brian, just surrender to it.

20:35.694 --> 20:37.696
Hey, I was in the episode, too!

20:37.779 --> 20:39.114
Bing-go!

20:39.198 --> 20:40.657
And I'm Joe

20:40.741 --> 20:41.825
Joe is the captain again!

20:41.909 --> 20:43.535
All right, I'll give it a shot.

20:45.162 --> 20:46.955
<i>Well, I came across the world</i>

20:47.039 --> 20:48.665
<i>For a very special girl...</i>

20:54.046 --> 20:55.797
Eyes forward, finish the number.

20:55.881 --> 20:57.466
Ranita, finish the number!
