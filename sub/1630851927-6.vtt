Come to the house
if you're hungry.

01:14.805 --> 01:16.738
- Thank you.

01:16.738 --> 01:19.293
- Hey. Take your hat off.

01:19.293 --> 01:21.019
- Oh. Sh--

01:39.347 --> 01:41.085
- Thank you, darling.
- You're welcome.

01:41.125 --> 01:42.557
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

01:44.352 --> 01:46.984
- Jimmy... you ready?

01:50.393 --> 01:52.432
- Uh, yeah.
- All right, let's go.

01:57.641 --> 01:59.229
- Thank you, Ma'am.
- You're welcome.

02:06.064 --> 02:07.789
- How's the one you rode in on?

02:07.789 --> 02:10.482
- Not real broke.
I think they said he's just two.

02:14.175 --> 02:16.143
I said he's not real broke.

02:16.143 --> 02:18.135
- We sell the broke ones
around here, Jimmy.

03:05.985 --> 03:07.498
Mama!

04:17.678 --> 04:18.886
- What are you doing up?

04:18.886 --> 04:21.785
- My father hasn't
called me back.

04:21.785 --> 04:23.166
Worries me.

04:23.166 --> 04:25.062
- I saw him yesterday,
he's fine.

04:25.102 --> 04:26.480
- Yeah, that's what
worries me.

04:28.965 --> 04:29.966
- Hm.

04:32.348 --> 04:34.626
Morning, beautiful.

04:43.186 --> 04:45.464
- Take me on a ride.

04:45.464 --> 04:47.294
- On a horse?

04:47.294 --> 04:48.519
- On a horse.

04:51.815 --> 04:53.610
- Just a ride, huh?

04:55.854 --> 04:58.339
- Well, I'm a little more
purpose-driven than that.

05:00.583 --> 05:02.585
We can talk about it later.

05:02.585 --> 05:06.761
- Beth, why can't you
tell me what you're thinking

05:06.761 --> 05:10.490
instead of half of what
we're doing and none of the why

05:10.540 --> 05:11.821
and then I spend
the rest of the day

05:11.831 --> 05:13.341
trying to figure out what
you're up to?

05:13.571 --> 05:15.184
- Because then you're going
to spend the whole day

05:15.184 --> 05:16.288
thinking about me.

05:21.259 --> 05:23.088
- I do that already.

05:42.590 --> 05:43.729
- I knew it.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.266
Who the fuck are you?

05:47.286 --> 05:48.562
- Who the fuck are you?

05:52.393 --> 05:54.119
- I'm the bitch about
to stab you in the stomach.

05:54.119 --> 05:55.842
- I'm sorry, I didn't know
he was married.

06:00.919 --> 06:03.972
- Here's a... situation

06:04.002 --> 06:06.979
I couldn't have dreamed up
in a month of Sundays.

06:07.119 --> 06:09.445
This is my daughter.

06:09.445 --> 06:11.481
She can be
a little overprotective.

06:11.481 --> 06:13.207
Put the knife down, honey.

06:13.207 --> 06:16.624
- Dad... if you're gonna
hire a hooker,

06:16.624 --> 06:18.852
would you please let me
get you a good one?

06:18.882 --> 06:20.456
- Beth--

06:26.278 --> 06:28.598
- Hope you didn't pay full
price for that boob job.

06:28.688 --> 06:31.846
- Actually, God gave me
these for free.

06:31.846 --> 06:33.451
Looks like he gave me yours too.

06:33.491 --> 06:35.850
- It is seven
in the fucking morning.

06:35.850 --> 06:38.232
I do not have the energy
for this shit.

06:38.232 --> 06:41.408
Now put it down.
She is a guest in our house.

06:46.102 --> 06:47.692
- I'm calling an Uber.

06:47.732 --> 06:48.829
- No, you're not.

06:52.177 --> 06:53.781
- Can you drive me
into town, please?

06:53.811 --> 06:55.974
- Can y'all just calm the fuck
down and have a...

06:55.974 --> 06:57.596
a nice breakfast?

06:57.596 --> 07:00.289
And then, yes, I'll drive you
anywhere you want to go.

07:04.534 --> 07:05.681
- I'll get dressed.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.403
- Ah!

07:14.690 --> 07:15.978
Mm.

07:17.594 --> 07:19.383
- I'm too old
for this shit.

07:19.723 --> 07:20.974
I'm too old for her,

07:21.024 --> 07:22.560
I'm too old for that
look you're giving me,

07:22.610 --> 07:24.213
I'm just too old
for all of it.

07:24.233 --> 07:25.590
- You weren't too old
for some of it.

07:27.384 --> 07:28.523
- You know...

07:29.043 --> 07:30.227
Be nice to her.

07:30.247 --> 07:31.348
- Okay, Dad.

07:31.398 --> 07:33.950
- She held a protest at
the Livestock office,

07:33.960 --> 07:35.359
threw a rock at your brother,

07:35.419 --> 07:37.159
got thrown in jail,
and I bailed her out for it.

07:37.209 --> 07:38.810
- And then brought her
home and fucked her.

07:38.810 --> 07:40.685
Along with your common sense.

07:40.705 --> 07:43.435
- We talked 'til late
and I offered her a room.

07:43.435 --> 07:45.955
Her clothes were
covered in pepper spray

07:45.955 --> 07:47.750
and paint so
I loaned her a shirt.

07:51.409 --> 07:52.990
You know, Beth,
maybe it's best

07:53.020 --> 07:55.585
you don't stay for breakfast.

07:55.585 --> 07:57.069
- Oh, Daddy.

07:57.069 --> 07:59.382
I wouldn't miss this breakfast
for the fucking world.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.943
- Is there anything to eat
that didn't have

08:14.973 --> 08:16.226
a heartbeat last week?

08:16.226 --> 08:17.814
- Uh...

08:17.814 --> 08:19.747
- Orange juice didn't
have a heartbeat.

08:19.747 --> 08:21.231
- Is it non GMO?

08:21.231 --> 08:23.630
- I'm not sure what that means.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.882
- It means a scientist
didn't alter the DNA

08:25.902 --> 08:28.653
of the orange to make more
money and ravage our bodies.

08:28.653 --> 08:31.552
- I just buy big bags
from the grocery store.

08:31.552 --> 08:35.038
- Do you like wheat grass?

08:35.038 --> 08:36.108
- I do.

08:36.108 --> 08:37.800
- We have a whole field of it.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.802
Hey, Gator,
would you go out back,

08:39.802 --> 08:42.632
pick some wheat grass
and throw it in a blender.

08:42.632 --> 08:44.358
She's gonna love it.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.845
- You grow wheat grass?

08:45.865 --> 08:48.155
- We grow wheat.
Which is a grass.

08:48.155 --> 08:50.260
Until it heads out,
then it is a grain.

08:50.260 --> 08:51.986
- That's a different
kind of wheat.

08:51.986 --> 08:54.434
- No, see I know you think

08:54.454 --> 08:58.717
it just magically appears
at Jamba Juice,

08:58.717 --> 09:00.719
grass grows in the ground.

09:00.719 --> 09:03.446
- Gator, Summer is a vegan.

09:03.446 --> 09:05.862
Could you make her
something with no meat or eggs?

09:05.862 --> 09:10.246
- Or milk.

09:10.246 --> 09:12.041
- Or butter.

09:12.041 --> 09:14.595
Maybe some pancakes.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.010
- I don't eat gluten.

09:16.010 --> 09:18.254
- What's gluten?

09:18.254 --> 09:21.913
- So wait, you'll eat
the wheat grass

09:21.913 --> 09:25.330
but you won't eat
the seed.

09:25.330 --> 09:27.090
- Our bodies aren't
designed to digest it.

09:27.090 --> 09:28.540
- Who told you that?
- Doctors.

09:28.540 --> 09:30.024
- My doctor never told me that.

09:30.024 --> 09:31.262
- Well, you should get
a new doctor.

09:31.292 --> 09:33.478
- You should get tested for
chlamydia, you fucking hippie.

09:33.518 --> 09:37.204
- Okay, Beth.
That's it.

09:37.204 --> 09:38.335
All right, she is my guest.

09:38.365 --> 09:40.552
You will treat her with respect
or you will leave.

09:40.552 --> 09:42.347
- I have a meeting anyway.

09:45.315 --> 09:47.076
Love you, Daddy.

09:47.076 --> 09:48.905
- I hope you find a therapist
who can help you.

09:48.905 --> 09:50.459
- I hope you die of ass cancer.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.499
You know, she can, umm...

09:56.499 --> 09:58.345
- She's a little old to be
jealous of the women

09:58.375 --> 10:00.986
her father spends time with.

10:00.986 --> 10:02.403
- Yes she is.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.775
- And the cowboy fantasy
is officially over.

10:05.925 --> 10:07.855
I'll be outside.

10:08.546 --> 10:11.341
- W-wait...

10:11.341 --> 10:13.894
- Well, that went
to shit in a hurry, didn't it?

10:13.994 --> 10:15.797
- It did seem to go pretty
fast, sir.

10:15.817 --> 10:17.416
- Yeah.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.315
- Wow, I like the light.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.985
- These windows along the south
heat this house.

10:33.985 --> 10:35.883
- Oh, great.

10:35.883 --> 10:37.110
Kayce?

10:43.268 --> 10:44.823
You coming inside?

10:44.823 --> 10:48.378
- Hey, does that dog
come with the house?

10:48.378 --> 10:50.821
- Is that dog back?
Come on! Come on!

10:51.769 --> 10:54.764
- I've taken that damn
thing to the pound twice.

10:54.764 --> 10:56.214
- Baby, you want to see
the house?

10:56.214 --> 10:59.424
- I don't need to, baby.
This is it.

11:00.805 --> 11:03.014
- Yeah, I think so, too.

11:03.014 --> 11:04.782
- We'll take it.

11:05.292 --> 11:07.646
- I'll call Animal Services
about the dog--

11:07.686 --> 11:10.193
- No, we'll take the dog, too.
- Oh.

11:10.193 --> 11:11.559
- I'm gonna check out
the barn.

11:11.569 --> 11:12.920
- Before you check
out the house?

11:12.920 --> 11:14.404
- Always.

11:23.206 --> 11:24.932
Hello?

11:27.210 --> 11:28.867
I got my family with me
right now.

11:29.937 --> 11:32.008
- Good dog.
Good dog.

11:35.598 --> 11:36.825
-
Send me the location.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.276
- Where'd your appetite go, son?

12:00.865 --> 12:04.765
- Terrell Riggins.
That's where it went.

12:06.525 --> 12:07.596
- Hmm.

12:12.221 --> 12:13.671
Good old Terrell.

12:20.056 --> 12:23.577
- I'm going to need you
to stand up slowly,

12:23.577 --> 12:25.130
with your hands above your head.

12:30.032 --> 12:32.862
- Walk backwards five paces.

12:32.862 --> 12:34.769
Do not turn around.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.171
I said do
not turn around.

12:46.669 --> 12:48.498
- If you want to shoot, shoot.

12:49.948 --> 12:54.090
It'll be murder, but won't be
the first one you've covered up.

12:54.090 --> 12:55.885
- Don't you talk to
me about murder.

12:55.885 --> 12:58.681
Now stand up and
turn the fuck around!

12:58.681 --> 13:01.788
- No. Just shoot me.

13:01.788 --> 13:05.619
I would much prefer that to
having my son yell at me

13:05.619 --> 13:06.965
in the house I built for you.

13:08.139 --> 13:11.038
Yes. I built it.

13:11.038 --> 13:14.904
I gave you the strength to walk
from the shadow

13:14.904 --> 13:18.701
of that fucking land baron
you called father

13:18.701 --> 13:22.187
for the entire lie of your life.

13:24.327 --> 13:27.814
- You tried to kill my family.

13:27.814 --> 13:29.404
- That is not your family.

13:33.095 --> 13:34.855
This is your family.

13:35.994 --> 13:37.686
That baby is your family.

13:37.686 --> 13:40.223
And that woman will
be part of your family, too.

13:40.263 --> 13:42.449
I give you my word.
I will build that for you, too.

13:45.072 --> 13:46.280
I want you to imagine something.

13:47.799 --> 13:50.003
Imagine that woman
and that baby gone.

13:51.354 --> 13:54.392
And then imagine yourself...

13:54.392 --> 13:56.359
in that house

13:58.258 --> 13:59.638
instead of this one.

14:00.881 --> 14:04.747
Imagine all the generations
of wealth

14:04.747 --> 14:07.992
you would've had to provide
for all the generations

14:07.992 --> 14:09.556
you leave behind.

14:09.596 --> 14:12.893
- Just fucking stop.
Stop talking. Please...

14:12.893 --> 14:14.757
- You gonna tell me
you'd miss him?

14:18.036 --> 14:19.555
- I can't tell you that.

14:19.555 --> 14:22.558
- Of course you can't.

14:22.558 --> 14:24.456
I doubt the jury's out
on how much you'd miss

14:24.456 --> 14:25.803
that bitch of a sister, though.

14:28.582 --> 14:29.979
- I'd miss my brother.

14:29.979 --> 14:31.463
- He's not your brother.

14:32.533 --> 14:35.467
- In my heart he is my brother.

14:35.467 --> 14:39.817
- In your imagination,
he's your brother.

14:39.817 --> 14:41.301
You barely know him.

14:42.958 --> 14:44.683
You miss what
you thought you were.

14:44.683 --> 14:45.788
That's all.

14:47.445 --> 14:50.482
And you'll miss that
whether he's alive or not.

14:51.656 --> 14:53.451
- What about right or wrong?

14:58.663 --> 14:59.837
- There's no such thing.

15:02.149 --> 15:06.671
There's no such thing
as right or wrong.

15:06.671 --> 15:09.985
There's no such thing
as fair, or moral...

15:11.780 --> 15:14.679
Those are words men invented

15:14.679 --> 15:18.062
to scare
and shame other men

15:18.062 --> 15:20.202
from taking back
what they've stolen.

15:21.444 --> 15:26.242
John Dutton used you

15:26.242 --> 15:28.693
just like he uses
all his children,

15:28.693 --> 15:32.808
to scare and shame others,

15:32.818 --> 15:35.148
so nobody takes back
what he stole.

15:36.839 --> 15:37.978
You know that's true.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.016
You know it.

15:44.398 --> 15:48.023
I have no agenda
but giving you back

15:48.023 --> 15:51.474
the family that you never had,

15:51.474 --> 15:54.823
and the legacy
he robbed from you.

15:55.893 --> 15:57.446
Did I try to kill them?

16:00.552 --> 16:03.141
You're God damn right I did.

16:04.475 --> 16:08.077
And I will keep trying
until I get it right.

16:09.596 --> 16:12.357
That's how much I love you...

16:14.428 --> 16:15.636
Son.

16:45.011 --> 16:46.633
- How many'd they get?

16:46.633 --> 16:48.842
- Eighteen.

16:48.842 --> 16:52.018
- What the hell is someone doing
with eighteen horses out here?

16:52.018 --> 16:53.985
- This is a racing family.

16:53.985 --> 16:56.815
They represent our Nation
on the relay circuit.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.889
- I'll take look around
and tell you what I think,

17:00.889 --> 17:02.442
but I ain't got
no authority out here.

17:04.133 --> 17:06.756
- You do fifty yards
out that way.

17:06.756 --> 17:07.861
And that's where they went...

17:09.311 --> 17:10.457
- I'll be right back, baby.

17:25.637 --> 17:29.020
My guess is
they cut the fence horseback

17:29.020 --> 17:31.989
and used the herd
to cover their tracks.

17:31.989 --> 17:33.611
- That's what I think, too.

17:34.585 --> 17:36.807
- The rez ends here.

17:38.685 --> 17:41.032
- So is that BLM?

17:41.032 --> 17:42.240
- That's the forest service.

17:48.522 --> 17:50.559
- Dirt bikes.

17:50.559 --> 17:53.148
They used dirt bikes.

17:53.148 --> 17:54.906
I'll need to talk with the
family when they get home,

17:54.926 --> 17:56.910
get some descriptions
on those horses.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.015
- They're home.

17:59.533 --> 18:00.741
They're just hiding.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.607
- White man with a badge
has that effect out here.

18:17.586 --> 18:19.898
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:22.073 --> 18:24.662
- Everybody wondered
where you went.

18:24.662 --> 18:26.595
- Not a believer in goodbye.

18:26.595 --> 18:27.976
When it's time to leave, I go.

18:29.046 --> 18:31.186
- Fair enough.

18:31.186 --> 18:33.832
I'm gonna run my family home
and then I'll come back

18:33.852 --> 18:37.192
and we can get some descriptions
or whatever paperwork

18:37.192 --> 18:38.848
you might have.

18:38.848 --> 18:40.989
- Here I thought you
were just a cowboy.

18:43.784 --> 18:44.820
- You ready, baby?

18:51.344 --> 18:54.209
- Who the hell is that?

18:54.209 --> 18:57.350
- Oh, she, uh, used to wrangle
at the ranch.

18:58.661 --> 18:59.904
- Hmm.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.700
- What?

19:02.700 --> 19:03.873
- Pretty good-looking wrangler.

19:05.634 --> 19:07.342
- Not my type, baby.

19:07.382 --> 19:10.273
- Oh, yeah?
Tall, thin, long black hair,

19:10.293 --> 19:11.605
brown eyes, yep,
not your type.

19:12.710 --> 19:14.919
- She sure was my type.

19:14.919 --> 19:16.507
She was one hot tamale.

19:16.507 --> 19:17.715
- Tate!

19:19.914 --> 19:21.822
- This is gonna be
a long ride home.

19:56.167 --> 19:57.513
- What do we got here?

19:59.826 --> 20:00.896
Be right back.

20:12.494 --> 20:13.805
- It's on the wrong side
of the fence?

20:14.944 --> 20:16.049
- Yep.

20:19.225 --> 20:21.132
- Well, if there wasn't any
fences, he wouldn't be

20:21.132 --> 20:22.433
on the wrong side of it.

20:22.473 --> 20:24.331
- It's a she and
if there weren't fences

20:24.391 --> 20:26.680
the whole herd would be standing
in the middle of the highway.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.613
- Why would they do that?

20:31.064 --> 20:32.479
- 'Cause that's what they do.

20:44.388 --> 20:46.942
- Shh.

20:46.942 --> 20:50.118
Easy. We're going to get
you back to mama.

20:51.119 --> 20:52.120
Yeah.

20:56.296 --> 21:01.474
- Don't know where she got out,
just drove the whole fence line.

21:01.474 --> 21:04.235
- She looks a little heavy
to be lifting over a fence, huh?

21:04.235 --> 21:05.754
- Yeah.

21:05.754 --> 21:07.326
Easy.

21:07.386 --> 21:10.517
Let's just cut it.
Then we'll patch it.

21:10.517 --> 21:11.760
Easy.

21:18.353 --> 21:19.579
Step on.

21:20.838 --> 21:22.115
Come on, baby.

21:27.495 --> 21:28.604
There you go.

21:31.814 --> 21:33.264
All right, let's see.

21:36.129 --> 21:39.546
- They should make a tool
to pull that wire tight for you.

21:39.546 --> 21:41.928
- They do. They just don't
fit in a saddle bag.

21:43.240 --> 21:44.379
- That should work there.

21:46.691 --> 21:48.348
After I get 'em out
of this pasture,

21:48.348 --> 21:50.005
I'll run the fence line here.

21:51.765 --> 21:52.939
- Where you taking them?

21:52.939 --> 21:54.151
- Pasture nine.

21:54.201 --> 21:57.012
There's way too much bear sign
in this pasture for me, sir.

21:57.012 --> 21:58.186
Morning, ma'am.

22:02.707 --> 22:04.756
- Understand us
a little better now?

22:05.952 --> 22:08.955
- I think I understand
you less.

22:08.955 --> 22:10.853
You love this.

22:10.853 --> 22:12.821
Him, too.
I can see it.

22:18.206 --> 22:19.862
- You coming?

22:20.967 --> 22:22.417
- No, I think I'm gonna walk.

22:23.659 --> 22:25.523
- Long walk.

22:25.523 --> 22:28.768
- Yeah, if I get tired,
I can just...

22:28.768 --> 22:30.390
- People still do that?

22:30.390 --> 22:31.805
- Yeah, they still do it.

22:36.672 --> 22:38.036
- You know it's pretty risky,

22:38.076 --> 22:39.882
young woman out here
in the middle of nowhere.

22:40.883 --> 22:42.506
- I'm not that young.

22:42.506 --> 22:45.753
And if I get tired I'll just
flag down one of your cowboys.

22:47.235 --> 22:49.064
I understand that
much about you guys.

22:49.064 --> 22:51.515

24:39.588 --> 24:41.314
- Thanks.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.109
- You need to learn to rope.

24:43.109 --> 24:44.869
Rope's the only tool we got.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.850
God.

25:03.819 --> 25:06.132
Fuck.

26:58.175 --> 27:00.591
- Ha-ha! There you go.

27:00.591 --> 27:01.765
Yeah.

27:01.765 --> 27:04.303
- Hey, show me the houlihan.

27:05.063 --> 27:07.391
- Let's worry about
the basics first.

27:07.391 --> 27:09.876
- I didn't say "teach me."
I just wanna see it.

27:09.876 --> 27:11.291
- Oh, all right.

27:15.641 --> 27:16.987
That's so cool.

27:16.987 --> 27:19.299
- All right, you head it,
I'll heel it.

27:19.299 --> 27:21.578
- All right.
- All right.

27:30.069 --> 27:31.967
Yeah!

27:33.106 --> 27:36.524
Thank you, Las Vegas!
-

27:37.697 --> 27:40.389
- Which rodeo
was your favorite?

27:40.389 --> 27:42.115
- Oh, Calgary, Alberta, maybe.

27:43.392 --> 27:45.981
It's sure one pretty
son of a bitch.

27:45.981 --> 27:47.811
Just wish they wasn't in Canada.

27:49.398 --> 27:50.848
- Why's that?

27:50.848 --> 27:54.438
- Ten straight days of
people being that nice to me

27:54.438 --> 27:57.648
had me craving that
rodeo in Fort Worth, Texas.

27:57.648 --> 28:00.824
Tell you something,
Fort Worth,

28:00.824 --> 28:04.103
you just think the word "fight"
and a fight'll find you.

28:10.488 --> 28:12.323
- So how come you're
out here with me

28:12.343 --> 28:13.630
and not in the bunkhouse?

28:16.011 --> 28:20.015
- No room for outcasts
like us in the bunkhouse.

28:20.015 --> 28:21.810
- I'm not an outcast.

28:21.810 --> 28:23.571
- Then why you sleeping
in the barn?

28:26.297 --> 28:28.092
- I told her I was sorry.

28:28.092 --> 28:30.163
- Seems like she didn't like
the way you said it.

28:32.234 --> 28:36.549
If I was you I'd find a way
to say it different.

28:41.071 --> 28:43.176
seems to me they don't like
the way you said it either.

28:44.868 --> 28:46.386
- I didn't say sorry.

28:49.562 --> 28:50.563
It's getting late.

28:53.462 --> 28:54.463
See you tomorrow.

29:05.543 --> 29:07.753
- Two to go.
- I'm going four.

29:07.753 --> 29:11.860
- So much for keeping it--
- You better watch it, boys.

29:11.860 --> 29:14.898
- Anyone named after a city...
- Come on, who's up?

29:14.898 --> 29:17.107
- Is a crooked fucking
card player, if you ask me.

29:17.107 --> 29:19.937
- Hey, keep your comments
to yourself or get in the game.

29:21.836 --> 29:23.872
- Hell, you know I work too hard
for my money.

29:23.872 --> 29:25.563
- I gotta jump
in here real quick,

29:25.563 --> 29:28.282
YOU work hard?
Did you hear what that man said?

29:28.282 --> 29:30.069
- I don't know nothing about
him working hard,

29:30.099 --> 29:32.123
I'm usually too
hard working to notice so.

29:32.143 --> 29:33.261
- Dude, y'all fucking
kidding me?

29:33.261 --> 29:35.125
Y'all wouldn't know hard work
if it crawled up your leg

29:35.125 --> 29:36.402
sucked on your fucking pecker.

29:36.402 --> 29:37.712
- There's Teeter talk.

29:37.722 --> 29:38.956
- You gonna let your
girlfriend talk to me like that?

29:38.956 --> 29:40.684
- Don't even start,
don't even start

29:40.694 --> 29:43.167
- Teeter, it's official.
Isn't it?

29:43.167 --> 29:45.124
- I don't know.
He don't like labels.

29:45.134 --> 29:46.412
- Do you guys have a song?

29:46.412 --> 29:49.819
Walker, now you can work for
your money. They need a song.

29:49.849 --> 29:52.970
- Oh, yeah, I've got...
Mm-hmm. They do.

29:54.648 --> 29:58.217
Take it easy mama, won't
you lay your head down?

29:58.217 --> 30:00.737
- I ain't your
fucking mama, baby.

30:00.737 --> 30:03.601
Woo!

30:03.601 --> 30:08.503

No fighting, that's the rule.

30:58.898 --> 31:02.005

I'm smashing a fucking guitar.

31:02.005 --> 31:03.731
- You're a fucking asshole.

31:03.731 --> 31:06.147
- You're done smashing it.

31:06.147 --> 31:08.736
- I've known you since you was
eighteen years old.

31:08.736 --> 31:11.393
You only known him a year.

31:11.393 --> 31:13.948
And you think you know

31:43.735 --> 31:45.082
- All right, man,
just sit there.

31:45.082 --> 31:47.360
- Where's that kit?

31:47.360 --> 31:48.724
- What do I do,
just pull it out?

31:48.744 --> 31:50.125
- No, no, no,
fuck, dude, don't.

31:50.135 --> 31:51.981
It's too close to
the God damn heart or an artery.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.401
- Turn him over.

31:53.401 --> 31:54.468
- Dude let me call the vet.

31:54.478 --> 31:56.956
- Fuck the fucking vet.
Call the fucking doctor.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.274
- We're not calling any doctor!

31:58.304 --> 32:01.236
- So then now what?
- Get my car, bring it out front.

32:03.100 --> 32:04.722
- Where the hell are you going?

32:04.722 --> 32:06.103
- Fuck this place.

32:06.103 --> 32:07.415
- Mia!

32:16.562 --> 32:18.440
- When are you gonna take
me on that ride?

32:20.568 --> 32:23.051

has got me nervous.

32:24.087 --> 32:25.743
What're you up to?

32:28.782 --> 32:30.058
Shit.

32:33.890 --> 32:36.030
- You don't have
to worry, baby.

32:36.030 --> 32:37.610
I'll get you a gentle horse.

32:37.630 --> 32:38.950
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

32:45.384 --> 32:46.515
- We're looking for something

32:47.869 --> 32:50.320
but you won't tell me what.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.506
What is it?

32:53.530 --> 32:55.843
- The place where you
make me your wife.

32:58.190 --> 33:00.502
- What kind of place
you looking for?

33:00.502 --> 33:01.745
- Somewhere fresh.

33:05.300 --> 33:06.370
Not a barn...

33:08.752 --> 33:11.134
or a swimming hole...

33:11.134 --> 33:13.412
or the river.

33:13.412 --> 33:17.347
Those places are polluted with
a thousand fucking memories.

33:17.347 --> 33:19.901
I want a place with no memories.

33:19.901 --> 33:23.077
- You know?
- Yeah.

33:23.077 --> 33:25.734
A place where nothing happened
until we happened.

33:29.574 --> 33:30.739
- I know that place.

33:34.571 --> 33:35.744
- You do?

33:35.744 --> 33:37.160
- Mm-hmm.

33:39.334 --> 33:40.703
- Take me there.

33:42.579 --> 33:45.202
- I will. Tomorrow.

33:51.381 --> 33:52.554
- What is that?

33:55.592 --> 33:57.974
- I want you to stay here.
Don't move.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.070
What the fuck did he do?

34:30.834 --> 34:31.939
- It looks like
the blade entered

34:31.939 --> 34:33.561
just beneath the clavicle--

34:33.561 --> 34:35.528
- Yeah, I'm aware of
where it fucking entered, Doc.

34:35.528 --> 34:37.530
- Went in just above the lung.

34:37.530 --> 34:39.649
Didn't penetrate an artery.
You're lucky.

34:39.889 --> 34:42.915
Sterilize the site
and prepare an 0.4 suture.

34:42.915 --> 34:45.780
It looks like the tissue
has adhered to the blade.

34:45.780 --> 34:47.996
When we remove it, there will
be considerable bleeding

34:48.025 --> 34:49.439
and considerable discomfort.

34:49.439 --> 34:51.061
I don't have anything
to give you for the pain.

34:51.061 --> 34:52.717
- What about some Banamine ?

34:52.718 --> 34:54.789
- We don't know the long term
effects of Banamine on a person.

34:54.789 --> 34:57.654
- Do I look like I'm gonna
live to be fucking seventy?

34:57.654 --> 34:59.311
Just give me some Banamine.

34:59.311 --> 35:00.578
- Three ccs.

35:00.618 --> 35:04.040
- Three ccs? I drink more than
that for a fucking hangover.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.456
Fill that son of a bitch up.

35:06.456 --> 35:08.561
Shoot some in my mouth
put some in my fucking arm.

35:09.459 --> 35:10.874
Please.

35:10.874 --> 35:11.979
- Six.

35:13.463 --> 35:15.741
- Gonna taste like shit and burn
like hell right there.

35:19.330 --> 35:21.119
- Get that fucking thing
out of me.

35:21.129 --> 35:22.713
- Ready with the gauze?
- I'm ready.

35:23.484 --> 35:26.165
- Fuck! Shit! Fuck!

35:26.165 --> 35:27.891
- Feels like
the blade hit the bone.

35:27.891 --> 35:29.617
- Not according to the X-Rays.

35:29.617 --> 35:31.734
- Just pull it out!
- Get it out of him!

35:31.764 --> 35:33.379
- I need to check
the x-ray again.

35:33.379 --> 35:35.278
- Someone pull this
fucking thing out of me!

35:37.245 --> 35:40.766
- Whoa!
- Fucking barrel racers.

35:40.766 --> 35:42.043
- You said pull it, baby.

35:43.217 --> 35:44.649
- Forceps and sutures.

35:44.669 --> 35:46.599
- Are you okay?
- Put some pressure on that.

35:46.599 --> 35:50.362
- Are you okay?
- Just another Monday.

35:50.362 --> 35:51.570
- What the hell
was Lloyd thinking?

35:54.262 --> 35:57.093
- Let's pretend it's Walker
sitting over there,

35:57.093 --> 35:58.784
what would you do then?

35:58.784 --> 36:00.303
- You know what I'd do, sir.

36:02.443 --> 36:05.135
- If Walker's such a problem,
what's he still doing here?

36:12.763 --> 36:14.386
- You've enforced the rules
of this ranch

36:14.386 --> 36:15.766
for thirty years, Lloyd.

36:17.458 --> 36:19.046
For you to be the one
to break them...

36:19.046 --> 36:20.668
What do you think that says
to everybody else?

36:23.326 --> 36:24.568
This is your last chance.

36:26.467 --> 36:27.709
But if you blow it, Lloyd...

36:31.334 --> 36:32.335
You understand?

36:34.751 --> 36:35.924
- Yes, sir.

36:38.513 --> 36:39.514
- Get the cuffs off him.

36:41.275 --> 36:42.448
God.

36:44.761 --> 36:47.833
No more girls
in the bunkhouse.

36:47.833 --> 36:49.455
- What about Teeter?

36:49.455 --> 36:51.526
She's a good hand.
She hasn't been any trouble.

36:51.526 --> 36:53.735
- All of them.
All of them.

36:53.735 --> 36:55.047
Lloyd and Walker go
in the round pen

36:55.047 --> 36:57.636
until all
the fight's out of them.

36:57.636 --> 36:59.155
And I mean every inch.

37:02.882 --> 37:04.125
Rip...

37:08.612 --> 37:11.098
I want you to make an example
out of the last man standing.

37:12.754 --> 37:14.480
- Yes, sir.

37:18.139 --> 37:19.347
Ryan, get him out of here.

37:22.419 --> 37:24.214
- What was that about?

37:24.214 --> 37:25.802
- Just cowboy shit, baby.

37:37.572 --> 37:38.987
- What are you doing?

37:40.575 --> 37:42.853
- I'm reading.

37:44.303 --> 37:45.408
- Why are you up?

37:47.437 --> 37:48.687
- Can't sleep.

37:50.447 --> 37:51.828
- Why can't you sleep?

37:53.381 --> 37:54.711
- Because I'm thinking about

37:54.721 --> 37:56.246
your little bitch
in the tank top.

38:01.527 --> 38:02.977
- Oh, she's mine, is she?

38:05.566 --> 38:06.601
- Is she?

38:15.852 --> 38:16.956
- You're mine.

38:19.614 --> 38:20.995
- I could kill you.

38:43.914 --> 38:46.020
- Come to the bunkhouse.
Both of you.

38:56.651 --> 38:58.688
Let's go.

38:58.688 --> 39:00.276
Everybody in here.

39:03.451 --> 39:05.453
Where's Mia at?
Mia!

39:05.453 --> 39:07.800
- She left.

39:07.800 --> 39:08.974
- Mm-hmm.

39:10.535 --> 39:12.322
This here is for you.

39:12.322 --> 39:15.152
Give that to her
when you see her.

39:15.152 --> 39:18.155
Teeter, pack your shit up.

39:18.155 --> 39:19.295
You both are gone.

39:21.607 --> 39:23.091
- Hey, what the fuck did I do?

39:24.990 --> 39:26.509
- It ain't my decision.

39:26.509 --> 39:28.614
The rest of you all
can come with me. Let's go.

39:53.570 --> 39:55.767
Lloyd. Walker.

39:55.787 --> 39:58.541
This shit ends here.
All of it.

40:00.485 --> 40:02.234
- I got no reason to fight.

40:03.831 --> 40:06.110
- Now you got no reason, Walker?

40:06.140 --> 40:08.128
- Hell, you fired
my only reason.

40:08.228 --> 40:10.978
- You're gonna stand in that
fucking round pen all day

40:11.048 --> 40:14.142
every day until
this shit is behind you.

40:21.534 --> 40:24.430
- All right,
here's your chance.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.155
I know how much you like it when
I got my back turned to you.

40:28.369 --> 40:29.882
- Let's dance, prick.

40:31.677 --> 40:33.990
- Boy.
Get over here.

40:38.695 --> 40:41.825
The only painless way to learn
this lesson is to watch it.

40:55.565 --> 40:57.324
You ain't done.

41:28.355 --> 41:29.804
- Ah! Fuck!

41:35.362 --> 41:37.398
Ah! Fuck!

41:50.678 --> 41:52.033
Get up.

41:55.105 --> 41:56.642
You ain't done.

41:57.272 --> 41:59.938
Get up. Or I'm gonna come
in there with you.

42:06.565 --> 42:08.498
- Your nine o'clock
is in the conference room.

42:08.498 --> 42:10.155
- What's my nine o'clock?

42:10.155 --> 42:12.399
- Head of Operations
for Market Equities.

42:12.399 --> 42:13.641
- Oh.

42:17.370 --> 42:19.060
Fucking shit.

42:22.270 --> 42:23.927
What the fuck
are you doing here?

42:25.170 --> 42:26.447
- My job.

42:28.276 --> 42:30.900
- You're Market Equity's
head of operations?

42:32.591 --> 42:34.766
How did you manage that?

42:34.766 --> 42:36.353
- I don't know, Jamie.

42:36.353 --> 42:38.666
I think the stars
just aligned.

42:41.186 --> 42:43.844
You ever hear the saying

42:43.844 --> 42:47.123
wherever something good
is trying to happen,

42:47.123 --> 42:50.609
something bad is
trying to stop it?

42:50.609 --> 42:52.128
- I've heard it.

42:55.545 --> 42:56.650
- I'm something bad.

43:05.207 --> 43:06.901
- You're going to ruin
everything, aren't you?

43:09.248 --> 43:12.528
- Everything,
you miserable motherfucker.

43:22.227 --> 43:25.713
- Oh, I don't think we need
prisons in this country.

43:25.713 --> 43:27.715
Criminals should just
be sentenced to moving.

43:30.291 --> 43:32.064
- You name him yet, buddy?

43:32.064 --> 43:33.376
- I just been calling him dog.

43:34.895 --> 43:35.896
- Dog works.

43:36.979 --> 43:38.822
- Can't call him dog forever.

43:38.862 --> 43:40.521
You want to be called person?

43:40.521 --> 43:41.941
Good job.

43:41.991 --> 43:43.662
Come on, Dog. Go get 'em.

43:46.009 --> 43:47.914
What are those mountains called?

43:47.974 --> 43:50.106
- Those are the Pryors.

43:50.136 --> 43:52.015
- That ain't it.

43:52.015 --> 43:53.534
- Well, no rush, buddy.

43:55.053 --> 43:56.813
You got all the time
in the world.

43:57.787 --> 44:01.849
- Come here, come on.
Come on. Go get 'em!

44:02.199 --> 44:03.716
Go get 'em!

44:03.916 --> 44:05.546
- I like it here.

44:07.721 --> 44:08.825
- Yeah, I do, too.

44:10.309 --> 44:11.626
Feels like...

44:11.626 --> 44:12.970
- Home.

44:48.831 --> 44:49.935
- Thank God.

44:56.977 --> 44:59.773
- Fucking fucking fuck!

44:59.773 --> 45:02.189
- Boy, these two really
don't like each other.

45:07.132 --> 45:09.714
Walker's been done
for an hour.

45:09.714 --> 45:11.474
Lloyd's got no quit in him.

45:32.564 --> 45:33.669
- I'll finish it.

45:37.811 --> 45:39.985
He's your friend, Rip.

45:39.985 --> 45:41.799
I can't ask you to do that.

45:41.929 --> 45:45.715
- They'll hate you, sir.
They'll hate you for doing it.

45:50.824 --> 45:53.309
It's my job.
I'll do it.

46:05.597 --> 46:06.702
I love you.

46:21.199 --> 46:22.994
This is for your
protection, Lloyd.

46:22.994 --> 46:24.478
Understand me?

46:25.575 --> 46:27.555
This is to protect you
from yourself.

46:27.855 --> 46:30.691
- Ah!
Oh, fuck!

47:01.296 --> 47:02.896
- So, we understand each other?

47:04.311 --> 47:05.968
- Yes sir.

47:06.613 --> 47:08.177
- Yes sir.

47:25.746 --> 47:27.023
- Fuck.

47:41.728 --> 47:43.799
Fucking Goddamnit.

47:59.400 --> 48:01.092
- I know what I want
to be when I grow up.

48:02.100 --> 48:03.542
- What's that, kid?

48:06.791 --> 48:08.271
- Him.

48:11.834 --> 48:13.242
I want to be him.
