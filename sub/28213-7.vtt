00:03.013 --> 00:05.848
The last words I said to my
daughter were angry.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.672
Some of the practices that
were taking place

00:07.673 --> 00:09.700
during my son's tenure were unacceptable.

00:09.725 --> 00:11.172
Maggie? It's Kathryn.

00:11.173 --> 00:13.848
Max's son wants to dish the dirt.

00:13.873 --> 00:16.045
You're going to accuse him of what?

00:16.085 --> 00:18.484
Blackmail, theft, illegal surveillance.

00:18.485 --> 00:20.123
On what evidence?

00:20.124 --> 00:21.836
Caden's confession.

00:21.837 --> 00:25.436
I will spread your most damaging
secrets all over the news.

00:25.480 --> 00:28.382
I've heard Orla talking about
investigations and tribunals

00:28.382 --> 00:29.861
ever since she arrived here.

00:29.862 --> 00:31.061
It's not real.

00:31.062 --> 00:33.101
How did you know
we were having this meeting?

00:33.102 --> 00:35.101
You have all the evidence right there.

00:35.102 --> 00:37.782
Hand it over and Caden will go to jail.

00:38.626 --> 00:40.021
I clicked on a link,

00:40.022 --> 00:43.621
and it was about
the downfall of democracy.

00:43.622 --> 00:46.370
I know Britain, I know my home,
I know my people.

00:46.371 --> 00:48.446
All I see are lines.

00:48.447 --> 00:50.655
Are you inside or outside?

00:50.680 --> 00:53.782
If you agree with her,
she's your best friend.

00:53.783 --> 00:55.720
If you disagree...

01:53.042 --> 01:59.200
_

04:38.960 --> 04:40.920
Let's go!

04:50.880 --> 04:52.520
Two, three, up!

05:51.006 --> 05:52.966
You've put your campaign on hold?

05:54.492 --> 05:55.812
I met him once.

05:55.837 --> 05:58.037
The Prime Minister's son, Saif.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.800
Shook his hand. He called me "Ma'am".

06:02.233 --> 06:05.260
It's strange.
I didn't know him and I feel grief.

06:05.477 --> 06:07.157
Grief, yes.

06:10.386 --> 06:12.386
But guilt? No.

06:13.992 --> 06:16.912
Whether the Prime Minister
resumes campaigning or not,

06:17.860 --> 06:19.579
the country's sympathies are with him.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.955
My sympathies are with him. As a father,

06:21.956 --> 06:23.555
as a parent, yeah, of course.

06:23.556 --> 06:25.076
But as a newsman?

06:26.149 --> 06:27.860
No, I printed the truth.

06:28.516 --> 06:31.515
Saif was a troubled young man,

06:31.516 --> 06:34.635
who was reading about the
violent downfall of democracy.

06:34.636 --> 06:38.475
From the heart of
this country's democracy.

06:38.476 --> 06:40.115
Now, should I have kept that secret?

06:40.116 --> 06:43.660
I'm not in the business
of hiding the news.

06:43.948 --> 06:45.988
Angela, answer me this...

06:49.428 --> 06:54.588
As a candidate to run
this country what has changed...

06:54.613 --> 06:55.933
...out there?

06:56.402 --> 06:57.722
For your people?

06:58.295 --> 07:00.700
- Nothing's changed.
- Nothing's changed?

07:03.316 --> 07:05.875
There are riots up and down the country.

07:05.876 --> 07:08.715
There's hatred of a kind
I thought we'd left behind,

07:08.716 --> 07:11.156
and there are fires burning
in every major city.

07:12.076 --> 07:14.156
There were always fires burning.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.555
Unseen, unheard,

07:16.556 --> 07:18.035
unreported.

07:18.036 --> 07:19.635
But they were there.

07:19.636 --> 07:22.075
Under every struggling high street,

07:22.076 --> 07:23.435
and every struggling home.

07:23.436 --> 07:27.276
Those terrorists were planning
that attack for many months.

07:27.740 --> 07:30.115
Long before my headline.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.715
Long before your campaign even began.

07:32.716 --> 07:35.836
Their hatred is decades old.

07:37.956 --> 07:39.035
So to imply...

07:39.036 --> 07:40.186
That my voters.

07:40.187 --> 07:41.319
...my readers.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.932
Are connected to those killers?

07:42.933 --> 07:43.966
To tarnish them?

07:43.967 --> 07:45.778
- To say that they're racist?
- Or violent?

07:45.779 --> 07:48.235
- No-one's saying that.
- But they're thinking it.

07:48.236 --> 07:50.915
And my people won't stand for it.

07:50.916 --> 07:52.400
When they are the backbone

07:52.425 --> 07:53.605
- of this country.
- Yes.

07:53.606 --> 07:56.071
When they fix our roads
and sweep our streets.

07:56.072 --> 07:59.235
When they tend to the sick
and teach our children.

07:59.236 --> 08:02.635
And those murderers
have nothing to do with my ideas

08:02.636 --> 08:04.395
or my vision for this country,

08:04.396 --> 08:07.475
any more than the Muslim terrorists
who bomb our buses

08:07.476 --> 08:09.715
have anything to do
with the Prime Minister.

08:09.716 --> 08:13.355
And I will not allow this crime
to be used by my opponents

08:13.356 --> 08:14.555
to silence me.

08:14.556 --> 08:16.612
There isn't a conspiracy against you.

08:16.613 --> 08:18.012
Not a new one, no.

08:18.013 --> 08:19.493
An old one.

08:20.180 --> 08:22.772
When we say we're poor,
they say we're racist.

08:22.773 --> 08:25.372
When we say we're suffering,
they say we're bigots.

08:25.373 --> 08:27.492
They say the outrage is theirs?!

08:27.493 --> 08:29.812
The outrage is ours!

08:29.813 --> 08:31.013
He lost a child.

08:33.773 --> 08:35.573
I lost...

08:36.405 --> 08:38.326
...my country.

08:41.253 --> 08:43.933
Angela, I came here to ask you...

08:45.213 --> 08:47.973
...if you were going
to soften your message.

08:50.733 --> 08:53.733
The truth of it is, if you soften it,

08:54.919 --> 08:56.700
there is no message.

08:59.826 --> 09:02.826
This election is about a hate crime.

09:05.613 --> 09:08.133
A hate crime no-one's talking about.

09:08.540 --> 09:10.693
It's a hate crime against the poor.

09:12.533 --> 09:16.940
And there are 20 million victims
out there waiting to be heard.

09:26.493 --> 09:28.293
This man was working for you?

09:33.093 --> 09:34.932
I never hired him.

09:34.933 --> 09:39.333
He was one of many private detectives...

09:40.733 --> 09:43.158
...collecting information
for the newspaper.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.180
Not collecting, stealing.

09:47.453 --> 09:50.973
He was... blackmailing us.

09:52.853 --> 09:55.013
So I told them to deal with it.

09:57.613 --> 09:59.492
I had no idea...

09:59.493 --> 10:01.853
I just said "deal with it".

10:04.173 --> 10:05.332
You gave an order.

10:05.333 --> 10:08.132
No, I... I didn't. I didn't know.

10:08.133 --> 10:11.412
You gave an order.
You're as bad as your dad!

10:11.413 --> 10:12.893
No. I was worse.

10:13.973 --> 10:16.692
Dad would only use private
detectives as a last resort.

10:16.693 --> 10:18.493
But I used them all the time.

10:19.413 --> 10:22.133
And he would never have
employed those people.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.172
He always hired the best,
except once when he hired me.

10:26.173 --> 10:28.532
Oh, just stop blaming your dad!

10:28.533 --> 10:32.572
You gave an order, whether you
understood the power of it or not!

10:32.573 --> 10:35.893
- You gave an order and a man is dead.
- I know.

10:38.093 --> 10:41.533
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

10:42.693 --> 10:47.013
I'm the worst of Dad,
without any of his strengths.

10:49.413 --> 10:52.533
Why do you think I did this to myself?!

10:53.893 --> 10:56.373
What, do you think I was just unlucky?!

10:56.940 --> 11:01.612
I sabotaged myself to make this stop!

11:01.613 --> 11:03.573
No, you were unwell. You were ill.

11:09.573 --> 11:13.253
Look, I... I came here to get better.

11:13.820 --> 11:18.252
And that is about so much more
than just learning how to walk

11:18.253 --> 11:19.493
and talk again.

11:33.173 --> 11:34.733
I'm going for a smoke.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.920
Why didn't you fight for custody of me?

11:59.373 --> 12:01.453
It was the worst mistake of my life.

12:06.139 --> 12:07.419
The worst.

12:09.693 --> 12:13.093
And I live with the guilt every day.

12:18.573 --> 12:22.533
And I grieve for those years
that I lost with you...

12:24.013 --> 12:25.373
...that I can't get back.

12:27.933 --> 12:29.772
But this isn't the way.

12:29.773 --> 12:32.373
Getting back at Max
won't fix the mistake.

12:33.533 --> 12:35.012
My mistake.

12:35.013 --> 12:38.012
If, with your life,

12:38.013 --> 12:40.408
if you confess,
you're going to go to jail.

12:40.409 --> 12:44.453
I'm not doing this to get back at him.

12:45.733 --> 12:47.652
I'm not doing this for him.

12:47.653 --> 12:49.372
For who? For Orla?

12:49.373 --> 12:50.573
For me.

12:52.333 --> 12:55.573
For myself, because I want to feel proud

12:56.066 --> 12:57.866
of myself.

12:59.226 --> 13:01.066
Just a little bit.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.733
I want to know what that feels like.

13:37.253 --> 13:39.372
The council won't pick up the rubbish.

13:39.373 --> 13:43.292
Say it's too dangerous. Not enough
police to protect the streets.

13:43.293 --> 13:45.132
Not these streets.

13:45.133 --> 13:47.412
Don't go out after dark.

13:47.413 --> 13:49.053
What's to go out for?

13:49.512 --> 13:50.792
You saw?

13:51.653 --> 13:53.532
As we drove through.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.933
We all need this election
to be over, don't we?

13:56.146 --> 13:57.826
Yes, we do.

13:59.846 --> 14:01.406
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

14:03.893 --> 14:06.732
Emily, we're here to talk about

14:06.733 --> 14:12.012
the way the investigation into your
daughter's murder was handled.

14:12.013 --> 14:15.532
The investigation itself broke the law.

14:15.533 --> 14:16.572
What law?

14:16.573 --> 14:18.532
Private detectives were used,

14:18.533 --> 14:21.172
to do things that the police can't.

14:21.173 --> 14:24.332
They went through
the houses of all the suspects

14:24.333 --> 14:26.092
without a search warrant.

14:26.093 --> 14:27.532
Innocent people.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.253
And all paid for by newspapers.

14:30.866 --> 14:33.466
- That's why you're here?
- Yes.

14:42.253 --> 14:44.173
You're not here about Tonia.

14:45.660 --> 14:48.173
You're causing trouble
for the people who helped me.

14:48.900 --> 14:51.452
The detectives and the journalists.

14:51.453 --> 14:54.412
We believe there are wider
implications, the way that the...

14:54.413 --> 14:56.732
"Wider implications".

14:56.733 --> 14:58.853
Oh, my God. That's why you're here!

14:59.580 --> 15:02.013
My daughter's not enough for you, is she?

15:02.620 --> 15:05.212
You're here about the
"wider implications"!

15:05.213 --> 15:08.692
What do I care if a few journalists
didn't go by the rules?

15:08.693 --> 15:11.413
Or a few coppers
did whatever they had to do?

15:11.740 --> 15:15.132
They were on my side,
and they caught him.

15:15.133 --> 15:18.652
His conviction could be overturned
if they knew.

15:18.653 --> 15:20.292
But they don't know.

15:20.293 --> 15:21.332
No.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.493
Look at you, the pair of you.

15:25.093 --> 15:28.013
I should've known
what you were really about.

15:28.420 --> 15:29.933
You're not interested in me,

15:30.740 --> 15:32.133
or my life,

15:32.700 --> 15:34.213
or my little girl.

15:35.613 --> 15:37.380
"Wider implications".

15:38.813 --> 15:40.493
He smiled at her.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.813
He waved at her.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.013
He strangled her.

15:47.093 --> 15:48.973
And they were here for me.

15:51.213 --> 15:52.412
We didn't mean to upset you.

15:52.413 --> 15:54.093
- We're very sorry.
- Get out.

16:22.533 --> 16:23.933
You want to quit?

16:25.653 --> 16:28.613
Take one of the jobs
you've been interviewing for.

16:28.906 --> 16:31.786
I believe in this just as much as you do.

16:32.693 --> 16:35.010
And it's not a job. I haven't
been looking for a new job.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.037
What then?

16:37.333 --> 16:38.973
We're moving to Israel.

16:39.980 --> 16:43.220
Sarah and I are moving the kids
to Israel.

16:44.453 --> 16:45.693
Oh.

16:49.813 --> 16:53.253
Well, I don't need to ask why.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.613
I'm not saying you're wrong.

16:57.013 --> 16:58.693
Here's all I'll say.

16:59.420 --> 17:01.773
We need people to fight.

17:02.620 --> 17:05.012
We need people to stand up
and fight for this country,

17:05.012 --> 17:06.859
or we might lose it.

17:08.813 --> 17:13.373
Maybe it's... not ours to lose.

17:17.573 --> 17:20.452
National Reporter has no respect!

17:20.453 --> 17:23.372
National Reporter has no respect!

17:43.693 --> 17:44.990
Where's Sofia?

17:45.015 --> 17:46.335
In the office.

17:53.453 --> 17:55.893
- You OK?
- Yes.

17:58.013 --> 17:59.293
Come here.

18:09.808 --> 18:12.648
I want you to fly home tomorrow.

18:12.673 --> 18:14.633
I'll join you as soon as I can.

18:17.253 --> 18:21.492
Growing up, at my birthdays,
there was cake, and games,

18:21.493 --> 18:24.772
and men with machine guns
to stop me being kidnapped.

18:24.773 --> 18:26.333
I'm not afraid.

18:28.333 --> 18:29.653
What if I am?

18:33.980 --> 18:35.460
What are you reading?

18:35.485 --> 18:38.765
It is an idea, yes,
to read each other's books?

18:39.813 --> 18:41.911
- Joseph Pulitzer...
- Yes.

18:41.936 --> 18:43.652
...publisher of New York World.

18:43.653 --> 18:46.252
His parents were
not in the news business.

18:46.253 --> 18:49.172
- They were merchants in Budapest.
- Yes.

18:49.173 --> 18:50.573
And so?

18:51.020 --> 18:52.652
You were born into steel.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.612
You made news your own.

18:54.613 --> 18:57.932
All I ask is that our
son has the same opportunities.

18:57.933 --> 19:01.573
Our son will have more opportunities
than any child alive.

19:02.893 --> 19:05.213
Opportunities to be different.

19:06.693 --> 19:08.972
You don't want him to be like Caden.
I understand that.

19:08.973 --> 19:10.893
I don't want him to be like you.

19:16.213 --> 19:17.933
No-one can be like you.

19:20.053 --> 19:21.852
When they try, they break.

19:21.853 --> 19:23.132
You're upset.

19:24.853 --> 19:26.893
These are very upsetting times.

19:27.446 --> 19:29.253
You were the Prime Minister's friend.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.532
I was never his friend.

19:31.533 --> 19:34.092
You ate with them, celebrated with them.

19:34.093 --> 19:35.732
You knew his son.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.372
I never called him a friend.

19:37.373 --> 19:40.732
Whether you used the word or not,
you were their friend.

19:40.733 --> 19:45.132
Every newsman would have published
that story if they had it.

19:45.133 --> 19:46.932
I wouldn't have been able to.

19:46.933 --> 19:49.013
I don't want our son to.

19:50.293 --> 19:52.492
All right, what do you want him to do?

19:52.493 --> 19:54.133
Whatever he chooses.

19:54.580 --> 19:56.532
All right. Well, he might choose news.

19:56.533 --> 19:58.292
He might choose my life.

19:58.293 --> 20:00.452
He might actually be proud of me.

20:00.453 --> 20:02.133
He will adore you.

20:02.780 --> 20:04.133
Worship you.

20:04.651 --> 20:06.533
He will do anything you say.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.573
That is what scares me.

20:19.493 --> 20:24.413
In your reading, did you
come across Carr Van Anda?

20:25.602 --> 20:26.555
No.

20:26.580 --> 20:30.812
Carr Van Anda was Editor of the New
York Times for 30 years, genius.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.372
Fluent in hieroglyphics,

20:33.373 --> 20:37.692
he spotted a forgery in a photograph
of an Egyptian tomb.

20:37.693 --> 20:42.212
He corrected a mathematical error in
a speech given by Albert Einstein.

20:42.213 --> 20:44.532
That kind of intellect,
I knew I could never be,

20:44.533 --> 20:47.333
but, his boss, Adolph Ochs,

20:47.900 --> 20:51.412
he started out by sweeping the news
floor at the Knoxville Chronicle.

20:51.413 --> 20:52.893
I knew...

20:53.420 --> 20:55.013
I knew I could be that man.

20:59.213 --> 21:01.053
There's all kinds of great.

21:02.259 --> 21:04.059
Caden could've picked any one of them.

21:04.084 --> 21:07.220
What did he choose? To be weak.

21:08.133 --> 21:12.332
Am I to respect that choice
because it was his own?

21:12.333 --> 21:14.053
Listen to yourself.

21:14.380 --> 21:17.053
Listen to how you speak
about your own son!

21:17.500 --> 21:18.973
I tell the truth.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.072
The truth?

21:21.693 --> 21:24.092
Yes, about the Prime Minister's son.

21:24.093 --> 21:25.412
About my own son.

21:25.413 --> 21:26.972
Sometimes children need a lie!

21:26.973 --> 21:28.692
I never did.

21:28.693 --> 21:30.372
I offer you a deal.

21:30.373 --> 21:32.403
I agree not to interfere
in your business...

21:32.428 --> 21:33.680
- A deal?!
- Yes,

21:33.705 --> 21:36.332
if you agree not to interfere
in our son's future.

21:36.333 --> 21:37.852
- Do you agree?
- No!

21:37.853 --> 21:40.612
Then I'll have this child without you.

21:40.613 --> 21:43.652
You must know
I'd never allow that to happen.

21:43.653 --> 21:48.013
You must know, I won't watch you
break him like you broke Caden.

22:16.754 --> 22:18.634
Do you want me to leave?

22:18.659 --> 22:19.979
No.

22:38.493 --> 22:41.333
There is no investigation, is there?

22:42.766 --> 22:44.886
You're not on trial.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.519
No.

22:49.533 --> 22:52.132
But I'm being judged.

22:52.133 --> 22:55.093
All the time. I'm being
found guilty, all the time.

22:56.020 --> 22:58.013
Found guilty of what?

23:05.613 --> 23:09.253
The army employed an academic
from Kabul University.

23:12.419 --> 23:14.299
His name was Bahlul.

23:15.333 --> 23:18.173
He was our translator, our guide.

23:18.620 --> 23:19.852
We became friends.

23:19.853 --> 23:23.213
We'd just, sit and talk,

23:24.099 --> 23:26.139
and drink tea.

23:28.839 --> 23:30.239
I fell in love.

23:37.133 --> 23:38.853
And did he love you?

23:42.206 --> 23:43.246
No.

23:46.613 --> 23:47.813
He was married.

23:50.093 --> 23:52.253
He had a daughter, a wife.

24:02.133 --> 24:04.013
Someone informed on him.

24:04.306 --> 24:07.066
The man who drank tea
with the foreigners.

24:11.559 --> 24:13.159
They hunted him down.

24:14.413 --> 24:17.613
They showed me photographs
and asked me to identify him.

24:18.773 --> 24:20.733
"Was that the translator?"

24:22.893 --> 24:26.053
"Was that the translator?" "Yes", I said,

24:27.493 --> 24:29.853
"That was the translator."
I didn't even use his name.

24:38.093 --> 24:43.132
Do you think
if you hadn't fallen in love,

24:43.133 --> 24:44.733
that he'd still be alive?

24:50.253 --> 24:53.372
I just think that 100 times a day.

24:53.373 --> 24:55.972
Your affection didn't kill him.

24:55.973 --> 24:58.332
You can't fix affections for me.

24:58.333 --> 24:59.696
Why are you so hard on me?

24:59.697 --> 25:02.292
Because you want to make it
so easy for me!

25:02.293 --> 25:04.572
Just fall in love and it'll all be OK.

25:04.573 --> 25:06.892
It's not easy to say I love you.

25:06.893 --> 25:09.173
It is the hardest thing I've ever said.

25:11.585 --> 25:13.105
Have you ever said it?

25:18.386 --> 25:19.786
I love you.

25:29.205 --> 25:30.965
You don't need me.

25:31.973 --> 25:33.172
You're better.

25:33.173 --> 25:36.213
Yes, and you're the reason
why I'm better.

25:38.453 --> 25:42.493
I learned to talk again
so that I could talk to you.

25:43.060 --> 25:47.052
I learned how to walk again
so I could walk to you.

25:47.053 --> 25:51.653
I learned how to move my fingers
so that I could hold your hand!

26:18.693 --> 26:20.213
Kathryn?

26:29.166 --> 26:30.806
Kathryn!

26:31.973 --> 26:34.813
You can't hide from me.
I know you're inside!

26:38.293 --> 26:42.293
I will wait out here till I die!

26:44.573 --> 26:46.333
She's not going to let you in.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.533
We'll see about that.

26:59.653 --> 27:02.013
They're going to call the police!

27:12.373 --> 27:14.253
Why don't you both come in?

27:14.720 --> 27:16.400
Thank you.

27:27.133 --> 27:28.532
Look at me.

27:28.533 --> 27:30.333
Look at me!

27:31.180 --> 27:34.013
We had a deal.
Caden was going to confess.

27:35.973 --> 27:37.413
I've read the file.

27:38.100 --> 27:39.572
My son goes to jail.

27:39.573 --> 27:42.012
What did you think would happen
when you started this?!

27:42.013 --> 27:43.652
I didn't start this!

27:43.653 --> 27:47.692
He spied on prime ministers and
princes and ordinary people!

27:47.693 --> 27:49.932
I came here to get my son better.

27:49.933 --> 27:53.212
But we're here now, knowing what we know.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.452
What are you going to do?

27:54.453 --> 27:57.692
- It's Caden's life.
- It's a lot of lives.

27:57.693 --> 27:59.133
It's Caden's decision.

27:59.412 --> 28:00.932
What is his decision?

28:09.533 --> 28:12.293
We're getting married, before I die.

28:13.453 --> 28:15.117
I never thought
I'd care about a marriage,

28:15.118 --> 28:16.871
never imagined I'd be allowed to do it,

28:16.872 --> 28:20.732
but I don't want to die,
having not stood up

28:20.733 --> 28:24.053
in front of a room full of people,
and said "I love you".

28:26.893 --> 28:28.853
Very happy for you.

28:29.119 --> 28:32.119
No, I want you to be there.

28:33.573 --> 28:36.452
Do you understand what that means?
What I'm asking?

28:36.453 --> 28:38.653
If you say yes, if you turn up?

28:40.733 --> 28:41.972
I understand.

28:41.973 --> 28:45.692
This isn't just my life's work.

28:45.693 --> 28:47.373
It's my life!

29:11.133 --> 29:13.133
Will you return to campaigning?

29:14.173 --> 29:15.293
No.

29:15.700 --> 29:17.772
Saif would have wanted you to continue.

29:17.773 --> 29:19.973
Yes, he would.

29:28.653 --> 29:30.613
You are still Prime Minister.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.786
Of what country?

29:34.399 --> 29:37.239
I am the Prime Minister
of a foreign land.

29:39.620 --> 29:41.373
They took our son.

29:41.900 --> 29:43.452
They didn't take our home.

29:43.453 --> 29:47.093
What is it that they chant at their
rallies, while I buried my son?

29:49.152 --> 29:51.312
They want their country back?

29:54.559 --> 29:55.980
They can have it.

30:12.573 --> 30:13.813
Hello?

30:16.385 --> 30:18.825
Yeah, I'll be there in 30 minutes.

30:23.566 --> 30:25.206
Go back to sleep.

30:33.773 --> 30:36.093
You know I own this entire building.

30:37.188 --> 30:39.892
Can't log into any one
of these computers here.

30:39.893 --> 30:42.652
So found this old thing
in one of the drawers here.

30:42.653 --> 30:44.453
- It belonged to Maggie.
- Yeah?

30:51.093 --> 30:53.213
Caden's going to confess.

30:54.159 --> 30:55.500
Yeah.

30:57.893 --> 31:00.812
Honestly,
I didn't think he had it in him.

31:00.813 --> 31:02.653
Well, he's in love.

31:04.213 --> 31:08.332
How many years do you think
he'll get? Five years, ten years?

31:08.333 --> 31:11.333
I mean, does he imagine that she'll
wait for him? I don't think so!

31:20.133 --> 31:21.733
Sofia's leaving me.

31:24.533 --> 31:28.333
She's intending to raise our son
on her own, without me.

31:29.033 --> 31:30.713
Without his father.

31:32.093 --> 31:33.932
I'm very sorry to hear that.

31:33.933 --> 31:35.092
Yeah.

31:35.093 --> 31:38.053
Well, I can fix it.

31:38.740 --> 31:41.013
She's negotiating, as a mother.

31:41.780 --> 31:43.772
She needs reassurances.

31:43.773 --> 31:48.893
I've given those to prime ministers
and presidents all my life.

31:50.293 --> 31:52.933
I can save my marriage because
I love her and she knows that.

31:56.013 --> 32:01.373
As long as the situation
with Caden doesn't go any further.

32:03.653 --> 32:07.773
But if he decides to push on
with his accusations...

32:09.773 --> 32:11.333
...I have to push back.

32:12.813 --> 32:15.092
I'll lose Sofia. I'll lose my two sons.

32:15.093 --> 32:18.653
You know when I feel the most alive?

32:19.773 --> 32:21.733
When it's all about to fall apart.

32:33.133 --> 32:35.213
- Angela's car was stoned?
- Yeah.

32:35.580 --> 32:38.013
Yeah. They smashed her windshield.

32:38.620 --> 32:40.732
Do you understand
how provocative this is?

32:40.733 --> 32:42.437
- Yeah.
- To imply that a woman was stoned

32:42.462 --> 32:43.572
as she drove home.

32:43.573 --> 32:45.572
I understand, yes.

32:45.573 --> 32:47.852
Is this the story
the country needs right now?

32:47.853 --> 32:50.100
What is the story
the country needs right now?

32:50.573 --> 32:54.212
Is it one of kindness,
and tolerance, and love?

32:54.213 --> 32:56.772
What if we tell that story?
We write that story and print it,

32:56.773 --> 32:59.652
what if the country says,
"That's not how we're feeling.

32:59.653 --> 33:01.732
"That's bullshit. That's a lie.

33:01.733 --> 33:06.333
"The truth is we're angry
and we're scared.

33:06.820 --> 33:08.933
"And we're not ready
to feel anything else."

33:11.293 --> 33:14.264
When you rang,
I was sleeping beside my daughter.

33:14.265 --> 33:16.093
She'd had a nightmare.

33:16.672 --> 33:20.413
I told her it would all be OK,
but I lied to her, didn't I?

33:23.173 --> 33:24.453
Maybe you did.

33:25.573 --> 33:27.373
Max, this isn't your country.

33:28.060 --> 33:29.972
You can't just rip it apart.

33:29.973 --> 33:31.693
You're right. It's not my country.

33:32.853 --> 33:34.653
It's their country.

33:35.132 --> 33:37.292
It's their story.

33:39.773 --> 33:41.133
Lauren!

33:44.320 --> 33:46.040
You're family to me.

33:46.933 --> 33:50.693
I've let very few people inside.

33:51.653 --> 33:55.093
Now you can step outside at any time...

33:57.293 --> 33:59.893
...but you will never, ever get back in.

34:05.486 --> 34:07.206
Run this story.

34:57.453 --> 34:58.933
Thank you, officer.

35:02.039 --> 35:03.159
Here.

35:04.346 --> 35:06.426
Jahan, read it!

35:12.685 --> 35:14.885
"Stoned on the streets of Britain."

35:17.853 --> 35:20.332
"Yesterday, the
Leader of the Opposition's car

35:20.333 --> 35:22.213
"was stoned by protestors.

35:22.740 --> 35:24.092
"Returning to her family home,

35:24.093 --> 35:26.372
"Angela Howard was attacked
in an incident

35:26.373 --> 35:30.493
"reminiscent of the notorious
Middle Eastern ritual punishment."

35:55.373 --> 35:58.093
I promised to mourn for 40 days.

36:00.893 --> 36:02.653
If I cut it short,

36:03.540 --> 36:04.860
would you forgive me?

36:07.293 --> 36:09.693
My country needs me.

36:11.739 --> 36:13.499
Win this.

36:33.613 --> 36:36.932
Angela! Angela! Angela! Angela!

36:36.933 --> 36:40.452
Please welcome Angela Howard!

36:56.493 --> 36:58.533
They tell us...

37:00.973 --> 37:02.612
They tell us,

37:02.613 --> 37:05.573
"We are a divided country."

37:06.733 --> 37:08.252
What they mean is,

37:08.253 --> 37:11.132
the people who normally
shut up and put up

37:11.133 --> 37:13.532
won't shut up and put up any more!

37:16.573 --> 37:19.332
They call it growth. But none for you.

37:19.333 --> 37:21.173
They call it wealth.

37:21.700 --> 37:23.573
But none for you.

37:24.020 --> 37:27.252
So many of you
have given up on politicians,

37:27.253 --> 37:28.773
on politics.

37:29.433 --> 37:31.353
I don't blame you.

37:32.053 --> 37:33.813
I don't judge you.

37:34.693 --> 37:37.333
But I am not a politician.

37:40.718 --> 37:42.413
I need to win!

37:43.020 --> 37:45.052
For this country's sake,

37:45.053 --> 37:46.612
I need to win.

37:46.613 --> 37:49.140
But winning's not enough.

37:49.973 --> 37:53.252
In politics,
even the winners are still weak.

37:53.253 --> 37:59.213
What this country needs right now is
the strongest leader it's ever seen!

38:02.893 --> 38:06.253
I am not offering to fix the system.

38:06.820 --> 38:11.053
I am offering to break it
and build you a better one!

38:14.653 --> 38:16.773
So I need all of you!

38:16.798 --> 38:21.588
I need you to convince your nan
who hasn't voted in 20 years.

38:21.613 --> 38:24.212
I need you to convince your young son,

38:24.213 --> 38:26.492
who reckons politics doesn't matter.

38:26.493 --> 38:29.132
And I need your neighbours,
and your friends.

38:29.133 --> 38:31.052
And I need your family.

38:31.053 --> 38:33.132
And I need your friends' families.

38:33.133 --> 38:35.532
I need every family!

38:35.533 --> 38:39.373
And I need you to take them
this message...

38:40.886 --> 38:42.286
One word.

38:42.311 --> 38:44.271
Just one word.

38:45.533 --> 38:46.812
Vote.

38:46.813 --> 38:50.233
Like tomorrow depends on it, vote!

38:50.234 --> 38:52.532
Tomorrow does depend on it!

38:52.533 --> 38:55.212
So, say it with me, and vote!

38:55.213 --> 38:56.852
Say it again!

38:56.853 --> 38:58.532
Vote! Vote!

38:58.533 --> 39:01.052
- Vote! Vote! Vote!
- Vote! Vote!

39:01.053 --> 39:04.053
Vote! Vote!

39:25.293 --> 39:27.253
You've done it before.

39:27.620 --> 39:29.220
Done what?

39:30.293 --> 39:33.373
Walked away, when it turned bad.

39:35.333 --> 39:38.333
You were 21 years old.

39:39.973 --> 39:42.733
Pregnant, career taking off...

39:44.133 --> 39:46.573
...married to a man
who was never going to change.

39:48.573 --> 39:50.813
He said he was never
going to love your daughter.

39:52.826 --> 39:54.466
And you left him.

39:55.773 --> 39:56.973
I swear...

39:58.500 --> 40:00.420
...bravest thing I ever saw.

40:01.333 --> 40:02.533
I had you.

40:02.780 --> 40:04.253
You still have me.

40:04.580 --> 40:05.972
You'll always have me.

40:05.973 --> 40:07.853
Max is my boss. It isn't the same.

40:09.699 --> 40:11.419
He's been like a father.

40:14.173 --> 40:15.933
The father I never gave you.

40:17.253 --> 40:20.573
So, I'm not going to judge.

40:22.693 --> 40:25.893
I can't imagine achieving
everything you've achieved,

40:26.273 --> 40:28.313
let alone walking away from it.

40:31.193 --> 40:33.353
I'm going to stand by you...

40:34.773 --> 40:36.453
...whatever you decide.

40:40.973 --> 40:42.493
I love you.

40:43.052 --> 40:44.572
I love you.

40:55.653 --> 40:57.453
This is his family.

40:57.780 --> 41:01.132
After his murder,
the army moved them here.

41:01.133 --> 41:02.852
They were given a home.

41:02.853 --> 41:05.053
They won't tell me where they are.

41:07.733 --> 41:11.013
I can find out, make sure they're OK.

41:11.679 --> 41:13.060
If you want.

41:19.733 --> 41:21.612
Can I take this?

41:21.613 --> 41:22.693
OK.

41:53.173 --> 41:56.213
You must be desperate
if you've come to me, Max.

41:57.813 --> 42:01.853
If Kathryn knew I was talking to
you, she'd never talk to me again.

42:04.053 --> 42:06.460
I know you don't believe this,
but I'm here to help her.

42:06.999 --> 42:12.399
To stop this family, my family, our
family, from tearing itself apart.

42:12.613 --> 42:15.012
You tore it apart when it suited you.

42:15.013 --> 42:19.852
Whatever happened in the past,
this will be worse.

42:19.853 --> 42:23.052
You mean because it's your scandal
and not hers?

42:23.053 --> 42:26.493
You really want to lecture me
about scandals and cover ups?

42:26.900 --> 42:29.052
In this room? In this house?

42:29.053 --> 42:30.892
With what your husband did?

42:30.893 --> 42:34.732
You want to disgrace
my husband, go ahead.

42:34.733 --> 42:36.892
I'll be cheering on the sidelines.

42:36.893 --> 42:39.453
With all you sacrificed
to protect him? I don't think so.

42:42.053 --> 42:44.372
All I want is to ask you a question.

42:44.373 --> 42:45.693
You can answer it or not.

42:47.886 --> 42:49.246
Go on.

42:49.872 --> 42:51.552
What does she want?

42:52.013 --> 42:53.653
What does your daughter want?

42:57.533 --> 42:59.572
You all think I'm trying to hurt you,

42:59.573 --> 43:03.693
but I'm the only one who's trying
to keep us all from getting hurt!

43:07.479 --> 43:09.439
All right, whatever.

43:10.333 --> 43:11.973
She wants...

43:12.626 --> 43:14.586
My daughter wants...

43:15.093 --> 43:16.933
What she's always wanted...

43:19.306 --> 43:21.266
...is to be more than me.

43:44.653 --> 43:46.333
Come on in, welcome.

43:55.893 --> 43:57.453
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:58.773 --> 44:01.732
Scott Ruskin, Nick Caplin.

44:01.733 --> 44:03.173
Hi, pleased to meet you. Hi.

44:03.719 --> 44:05.759
You're here.

44:06.413 --> 44:08.540
Yes. It was hard.

44:10.893 --> 44:13.052
We haven't been introduced.

44:13.053 --> 44:14.893
Sarah? Sarah!

44:21.773 --> 44:23.373
You're OK.

44:51.072 --> 44:52.792
Tasalah.

45:12.533 --> 45:14.493

...as I gave you myself

46:31.046 --> 46:32.766
many years ago.

46:34.253 --> 46:37.653
And I'm sorry that
I can't stay with you for long.

46:39.013 --> 46:43.373
But today isn't about
what our love will be.

46:44.653 --> 46:46.693
It's about what our love has become.

46:48.853 --> 46:51.093
You're my only true love.

46:53.173 --> 46:55.013
I wanted to tell the world...

46:56.493 --> 46:58.053
...this angry world...

47:01.446 --> 47:03.686
...that you're the love of my life.

47:34.573 --> 47:36.213
Is this where you live?

47:38.253 --> 47:39.860
It rains a lot.

47:40.653 --> 47:42.813
The garden must be very green.

47:45.173 --> 47:47.453
Why are you in this place?

47:49.573 --> 47:52.773
I was sad, for a time.

47:54.933 --> 47:58.093
This place makes you happy?

48:01.933 --> 48:03.573
They try.

48:17.377 --> 48:19.039
_

48:19.040 --> 48:21.040
_

48:22.166 --> 48:24.166
_

48:26.020 --> 48:28.020
_

48:29.500 --> 48:31.500
_

48:33.220 --> 48:35.220
_

48:50.613 --> 48:52.412
It was perfect.

48:52.413 --> 48:55.213
I wasn't sure if you'd show up.

48:57.853 --> 48:59.493
I know Max.

49:00.660 --> 49:02.213
He'll try something.

49:02.732 --> 49:04.492
What will it be?

49:06.813 --> 49:09.653
Something that none of us will expect.

49:12.453 --> 49:14.333
On days like this...

49:16.133 --> 49:17.693
...we should stay.

49:24.093 --> 49:25.453
And on other days?

49:32.693 --> 49:35.573
- The gate will open for you just there.
- Thank you.

49:39.253 --> 49:40.893
I like her.

49:43.093 --> 49:44.733
I like her too.

50:12.893 --> 50:15.012
Max would like to speak with you.

50:15.013 --> 50:17.652
Smart of him to send you.

50:17.653 --> 50:20.413
Just listen to him, that's all.

50:20.933 --> 50:22.693
It's never just all.

50:48.613 --> 50:50.853
You remember where we first met?

50:56.413 --> 50:57.493
Max...

51:00.053 --> 51:02.293
...I didn't come here
to reminisce with you.

51:03.359 --> 51:04.999
It's relevant.

51:06.301 --> 51:07.726
It's manipulative.

51:08.606 --> 51:09.973
It won't work.

51:10.300 --> 51:11.813
Then you got nothing to lose.

51:17.653 --> 51:19.613
We were at a charity gala.

51:22.453 --> 51:25.173
Yeah, I saw you sneaking outside.

51:25.900 --> 51:27.452
I was bored.

51:27.453 --> 51:28.340
I followed you.

51:29.580 --> 51:31.013
You were smoking.

51:31.500 --> 51:33.373
Alone, by yourself.

51:35.333 --> 51:37.132
Underneath an olive tree.

51:37.133 --> 51:38.773
Filled with lights.

51:41.222 --> 51:42.815
Almost like you were posing.

51:42.840 --> 51:44.193
For you?

51:44.220 --> 51:46.013
Don't flatter yourself.

51:47.213 --> 51:50.536
I asked you for a cigarette.
You'd never smoked in your life.

51:50.537 --> 51:52.576
- Which was pretty obvious.
- By the way you held it.

51:52.601 --> 51:53.643
Yeah.

51:54.306 --> 51:55.739
I started laughing.

51:58.253 --> 51:59.853
Those were the days.

52:01.533 --> 52:03.693
When we didn't make each other cry.

52:07.339 --> 52:08.739
We had something.

52:10.086 --> 52:12.646
I've never disagreed with you about that.

52:17.653 --> 52:19.133
Here we are.

52:19.260 --> 52:20.820
Here we are.

52:22.613 --> 52:24.213
We can never make it right.

52:25.253 --> 52:26.533
No.

52:27.533 --> 52:28.933
But we can make it worse.

52:33.140 --> 52:34.733
Caden's grown up.

52:35.820 --> 52:37.412
For the second time in his life.

52:37.413 --> 52:39.692
I see that. I accept it.

52:39.693 --> 52:43.413
Except this time he's grown up
to be a different kind of man.

52:43.900 --> 52:46.813
The man he should've grown up
to be the first time round.

52:48.860 --> 52:50.693
I didn't ask him to do this.

52:51.380 --> 52:52.973
I haven't encouraged him.

52:53.500 --> 52:55.373
This is who he is.

52:55.693 --> 52:57.333
This is what he wants.

52:59.100 --> 53:01.733
You got one thing wrong.
It's not what he wants.

53:02.813 --> 53:04.453
No, Caden...

53:06.093 --> 53:08.293
...is sentimental, he's emotional.

53:09.813 --> 53:11.333
Love drives him.

53:12.853 --> 53:14.453
This is all about you.

53:14.893 --> 53:16.326
He wants to be a good son.

53:17.533 --> 53:19.293
Worthy of his mother's love.

53:20.693 --> 53:22.813
I was given a second chance.

53:26.333 --> 53:30.620
What if I offered you
a second chance, at a career?

53:33.733 --> 53:36.293
Instead of trying to knock
everything down,

53:36.860 --> 53:38.412
you took control?

53:38.413 --> 53:40.373
- Of what?
- The paper.

53:41.860 --> 53:43.720
- Your newspaper?
- Yeah.

53:43.721 --> 53:45.813
Yeah. Clean it up, make amends.

53:46.226 --> 53:48.826
Fix whatever problems there might be.

53:51.093 --> 53:52.812
Are you offering me a job?

53:52.813 --> 53:54.933
Well, you can't write, but you can rule.

53:59.413 --> 54:00.653
Huh?

54:01.082 --> 54:03.173
You're bribing the wrong person.

54:03.553 --> 54:04.713
Hmm.

54:05.853 --> 54:07.652
Well, if you took the job,

54:07.653 --> 54:11.212
your first task would be
to convince Caden to say nothing.

54:11.213 --> 54:15.133
You stole that information about the
Prime Minister's son, didn't you?

54:17.586 --> 54:19.066
It wasn't a leak.

54:20.246 --> 54:21.766
You stole it...

54:22.613 --> 54:24.493
...from the heart of government.

54:26.186 --> 54:28.546
And now a young man is dead...

54:29.813 --> 54:33.132
...and the country
is tearing itself apart.

54:33.133 --> 54:37.092
And that woman,
that strange, brilliant woman,

54:37.093 --> 54:38.732
who you endorsed,

54:38.733 --> 54:41.612
who none of us really have a clue about,

54:41.613 --> 54:44.732
she now might just win.

54:44.733 --> 54:46.972
Kathryn, you can walk out of this office

54:46.973 --> 54:49.572
and have a smoke, alone,

54:49.573 --> 54:51.133
aloof,

54:52.273 --> 54:53.466
superior,

54:53.820 --> 54:55.572
and completely irrelevant,

54:55.573 --> 54:58.172
or you could be at the centre
of this country,

54:58.173 --> 55:00.732
making changes, making decisions,

55:00.733 --> 55:02.293
making a difference.

55:03.900 --> 55:05.580
Which is it going to be?

55:08.773 --> 55:10.813
I'm going to watch you burn.

55:12.173 --> 55:13.613
No.

55:17.093 --> 55:19.292
No, you will watch us all burn.

55:19.293 --> 55:21.573
You're going to watch this family burn.

55:23.053 --> 55:25.093
Take the job!
