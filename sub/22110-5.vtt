Our top story: stopping
the Decepticons with beer?

14:03.559 --> 14:04.994
According to our sources,

14:05.028 --> 14:07.863
the search is underway
for a man strong enough

14:07.897 --> 14:10.366
to throw a keg
with enough force

14:10.399 --> 14:12.001
to save
the Seven Wonders of the World.

14:12.035 --> 14:13.369
(knock at door)

14:16.139 --> 14:18.174
What took you so long?

14:18.207 --> 14:20.409
There was a train and
I like to count the cars.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.410
It was a big one.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.611
Me, too. That is fun.

14:22.645 --> 14:24.347
But you're wasting
your time coming here.

That's my funeral shirt.

Look, Peter, I didn't want
to ask you to do this

14:34.823 --> 14:37.093
because of that maverick
but awesome thing you did

14:37.126 --> 14:39.028
in the battle war of the past.

14:39.062 --> 14:41.464
Is this the stuff you didn't
want me to ask you about?

I told you not to
ask me about that.

14:43.166 --> 14:45.734
He went rogue
and saved everyone's lives,

14:45.768 --> 14:47.370
but he didn't do it
by the book.

14:47.403 --> 14:49.205
Is that why he can't
get an erection?

16:37.346 --> 16:38.547
That was a long time ago.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.083
It was two months ago.

Two months is a long time

16:41.417 --> 16:44.153
