WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:03.504
Grace, you awake?

00:05.339 --> 00:06.140
Grace!

00:14.515 --> 00:16.517
I'm up.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.153
You can turn off
the bacon alarm.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.588
It's amazing.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.790
You know, you--you go to bed
looking like Courtney Cox

00:22.823 --> 00:25.159
and you wake up Courtney Love.

00:30.831 --> 00:33.434
Just serve the bacon,
jackass.

00:33.467 --> 00:36.104
And we're officially
my parents.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.541
I'm sorry.
I got no sleep last night.

00:40.574 --> 00:44.612
I have
three apartments to do
by the end of the month.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.481
Normally, I would
do the same design
three times in a row,

00:47.515 --> 00:50.318
but the old bags
know each other.

00:50.351 --> 00:53.554
It's so much work.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.157
I think I'm gonna have
to hire another assistant
for a while.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.858
Karen's got
her hands full

00:57.891 --> 01:00.128
carving penises
into her desk...

01:01.662 --> 01:06.234
and getting her
real estate license
online.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.102
Well, that would explain
why she tried to get me

01:08.136 --> 01:10.604
to buy a condo
in the Poconos.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.773
It would also
explain this penis.

01:16.644 --> 01:17.611
Look at me.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.382
I'm glowing.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.185
Congratulations, Jack.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.587
Are you gonna find out
the gender or do you
wanna be surprised?

01:26.620 --> 01:29.257
I'm not pregnant.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.624
I'm in love.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.593
Oh, Jack, that's great.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.496
Are you gonna find out
the gender or do you
wanna be surprised?

01:37.365 --> 01:38.599
Oh, Grace.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.201
If I weren't so happy,

01:40.234 --> 01:42.336
I might say
something hateful,

01:42.370 --> 01:44.405
like bacon isn't love.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.343
So tell us
about your new boyfriend.

01:49.377 --> 01:52.180
How many hours
have you been going out?

01:52.213 --> 01:53.647
Seventeen.

01:53.681 --> 01:56.550
His name is Travis,

01:56.584 --> 01:59.687
and he's the hottest guy
I've ever gone out with.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.657
He's very into the downtown
gay country two-step cowboy
rodeo bar scene.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.895
Sometimes I think you guys
are just too creative.

02:07.928 --> 02:11.599
Why can't you just be gay
and leave it at that?

02:11.632 --> 02:13.367
Listen, without all this,

02:13.401 --> 02:15.203
we're--we're just guys
who can't throw balls.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.307
Will, come out
with us Friday.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.175
I'm dying for you
to meet Travis.

02:21.209 --> 02:24.945
All right. But I hate
those gay theme bars.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.747
You know, they always
have such awful names.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.517
Oh, no, no, no.
The Cowpoke's not
like that at all.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.386
( theme song )

02:39.693 --> 02:42.696
Well, you seem really,
really qualified.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.299
- I'll be in touch.
- Thanks. I'll look forward
to hearing from you.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.404
Um, could I have my purse?

02:55.543 --> 02:57.278
Sure, honey.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.413
Condoms,
but no breath mints.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.688
I like a gal that cuts
to the chase. Huh?

03:11.359 --> 03:14.428
Well, so far,
she's the one to beat.

03:14.462 --> 03:17.598
Although she--she might
almost be too pretty.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.733
Eh, I'll just find a way
to get ten pounds on her.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.305
Good luck with that.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.406
- Cupcake?
- Oh, I'd love one.

03:34.448 --> 03:37.485
I'm here
for the interview
with Grace Adberg.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.319
Oh.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.562
It's Adler.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.632
Are you making fun
of my accent?

03:51.665 --> 03:53.734
No. No, no.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.837
I--I--I wouldn't make fun
of any accent.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.473
Well, except,
maybe southern.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.775
I'm sorry, I don't care
if they're a rocket scientist.

04:01.809 --> 04:02.943
They still sound dumb.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.414
Please, come sit.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.482
Here, honey,
lemme take your purse.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.718
( chuckles )

04:12.753 --> 04:14.788
KAREN: Ooh!

04:14.822 --> 04:16.490
Somebody likes figs.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.527
So, Pam...

04:19.560 --> 04:20.961
That's a nice name.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.463
What were you expecting?

04:22.496 --> 04:23.864
Just because
I am Middle-Eastern,

04:23.897 --> 04:26.500
it should be a long
and unpronounceable name

04:26.534 --> 04:29.503
like
( speaks in Farsi )?

04:32.840 --> 04:34.808
Oh, no. Not at all.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.845
I wasn't implying it was
anything crazy like that.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.614
Because that's what it is.

04:40.648 --> 04:45.419
KAREN: Hey, your hair's
so short in your driver's
license picture.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.888
Look a little bit
like Omar Sharif.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.426
I don't like you.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.598
What an interesting resume.

04:57.631 --> 05:02.570
Wow! I had no idea that they
had House of Pies in Tehran.

05:02.603 --> 05:05.906
Well, everybody likes pie,
not just Americans.

05:05.939 --> 05:09.410
Oh, of course. I didn't--
I didn't mean to imply that.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.778
You are absolutely right.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.614
Everyone loves pie.

05:13.647 --> 05:18.552
And just because the saying
is "American as apple pie"

05:18.586 --> 05:21.555
doesn't mean it couldn't be
"Iranian as apple pie."

05:23.491 --> 05:26.794
Or, "Bye, bye,
Miss Iranian pie".

05:34.602 --> 05:40.941
* Bye, bye,
Miss Iranian pie *

05:40.974 --> 05:45.646
* Drove my ox-cart
to the levee *

05:45.679 --> 05:49.683
* but the levee
was dry *

05:49.717 --> 05:52.019
I am making you
uncomfortable.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.522
Clearly you were never
going to consider

05:54.555 --> 05:56.890
a Middle-Eastern woman
for this position.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.692
No, no.
That's not true at all.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.461
I'm definitely considering
you for this position.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.896
KAREN: Careful.

06:07.067 --> 06:10.871
I just wish
I saw a--a little more
design experience here.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.741
I started to put together
a portfolio,

06:13.774 --> 06:15.476
but it was difficult

06:15.509 --> 06:17.611
with the revolution,
the oppression,

06:17.645 --> 06:20.581
and the line at Kinko's.

06:22.850 --> 06:26.620
I'm sorry. I take
for granted how many
opportunities I've had.

06:26.654 --> 06:27.821
Mm-hmm.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.957
- You know what?
- KAREN: Uh, honey...

06:29.990 --> 06:33.761
I forgot to tell you
that the messenger
called, and he said,

06:33.794 --> 06:35.529
"I ran your credit card
and it's bad!"

06:40.000 --> 06:41.502
Can you start tomorrow?

06:41.535 --> 06:43.604
PAM: Thank you.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.706
- You won't regret this.
- I know I won't.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.107
Nice purse, honey.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.009
It's not made out of camel,

06:49.042 --> 06:50.911
if that's
what you're implying.

06:53.847 --> 06:54.882
I kind of was.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.889
( sighs )
Well, I hate to say it,

07:01.922 --> 07:04.625
but I think you just made
a big mistake, Grace.

07:04.658 --> 07:08.529
To quote Samuel Jackson
in almost any movie...

07:11.164 --> 07:13.967
"I got a bad feeling
about this."

07:22.810 --> 07:27.014
Wow.
A gay western bar.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.849
Where's the mechanical
bull-dyke?

07:33.954 --> 07:34.588
Over there.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.093
No man has ever
stayed on it.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.933
- Oh, there's Travis!
- Which one?

07:45.966 --> 07:48.836
The one in the cowboy hat
and tight jeans.

07:48.869 --> 07:49.837
- Him?
- No.

07:49.870 --> 07:50.838
- Him?
- No.

07:50.871 --> 07:51.839
- Him?
- No.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.173
- Him?
- No.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.608
- Him?
- No, him!

07:54.642 --> 07:56.577
No!

07:56.610 --> 07:58.612
Wow, he's crazy hot.

07:58.646 --> 08:01.081
Okay, calm down.
He's mine.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.885
And the best part,

08:04.918 --> 08:08.756
I really get along
with that little doggie.

08:08.789 --> 08:12.960
John Wayne
would be so proud...

08:12.993 --> 08:14.161
to shoot you.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.731
Travis!

08:17.765 --> 08:19.833
Hey, Jack!

08:19.867 --> 08:21.602
Oh!
( chuckles )

08:21.635 --> 08:23.136
Too bad they already played
the bootin'-scootin' boogie.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.706
You missed
the bootin' and scootin',
but we can still boogie.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.841
And I'm leaving.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.142
Wait, wait, wait.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.711
Travis,
this is my besty, Will.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.079
- How you doin'?
- Hi.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.081
Okay, I'm gonna get us
some drinks, all right?

08:34.114 --> 08:36.850
It's so fun being
in a gay cowboy bar.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.619
Everyone's so rugged!

08:41.121 --> 08:43.991
Can we get
three lemon drops, please?

08:45.959 --> 08:47.661
( 9 to 5 by Dolly Parton
playing )

08:47.695 --> 08:49.129
I love this song.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.964
It was playing
when I came out to my wife.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.033
Strangely enough,
she hates it.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.872
It's fun to laugh
at an anonymous
woman's heartbreak.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.108
Hey, Will!

09:01.141 --> 09:03.010
While I wait
for the drinks,
dance with Travis,

09:03.043 --> 09:04.978
and don't feel
so self-conscious.

09:05.012 --> 09:08.749
Heavy bodies always
look better in motion.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.885
- How 'bout it, Will?
- Why not?

09:11.919 --> 09:14.121
How often do I get to dance
underneath a disco ball

09:14.154 --> 09:16.023
hanging from a wagon wheel?

09:16.056 --> 09:18.158
All right.
You just follow my lead.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.760
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

09:19.793 --> 09:24.064
All right.
One, two, quick, stop.

09:24.097 --> 09:27.835
One, two, quick, stop.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.002
Yeah, I'm getting it.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.004
Sure are!

09:31.038 --> 09:33.040
You're on it like spots
on an Appaloosa.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.977
Tell me, when, uh,
when you go home
at night,

09:37.010 --> 09:38.646
and you--you take
all this off,

09:38.679 --> 09:40.881
do you still talk
like that?

09:40.914 --> 09:42.783
You wanna find out?

09:42.816 --> 09:44.184
Excuse me?

09:44.217 --> 09:46.920
I think you're hot.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.890
And spin!

09:49.923 --> 09:51.792
( phone rings )

09:51.825 --> 09:54.795
( ring )

09:54.828 --> 09:57.865
( ring )

09:57.898 --> 09:59.900
( ringing )

09:59.933 --> 10:02.069
Hey, Princess Jasmine,

10:02.102 --> 10:04.137
show time!

10:05.973 --> 10:07.675
Hello.

10:07.708 --> 10:11.244
( speaks in Farsi )

10:11.278 --> 10:13.947
Oh. Okay.

10:13.981 --> 10:17.818
Uh, a--a little refresher
on the refresher course.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.953
Please answer the phone
in English.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.790
Oh, I forgot.
I'm in America.

10:22.823 --> 10:26.760
I'm supposed to be ashamed
of my cultural heritage.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.799
Pam, did you--
did you fax over the designs
to the cabinet maker yet?

10:31.832 --> 10:34.702
I'll do it right after
my smoke break.

10:34.735 --> 10:38.338
I'm sorry.
But remember, I told you
you can't smoke here.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.841
It's a part
of my religion.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.846
Smoking in the office.

10:45.879 --> 10:49.149
So inappropriate.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.854
Hey, anybody mind
if I take my boob out
for a second?

10:55.756 --> 10:58.125
Hey!

10:58.158 --> 10:59.760
It's one thing
at dinner, Karen.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.995
But at work, I'd really
prefer you keep it in.

11:04.031 --> 11:07.234
What--
Why is line 2 blinking?

11:07.267 --> 11:08.869
Who's been on hold?

11:08.902 --> 11:11.839
Oh, I forgot.
It's Mrs. Van Helden.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.741
Okay, she's just
our most important client.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.075
I'm sorry,
let me get it.

11:15.108 --> 11:18.245
No. No! Ah!
You just hung up on her.

11:18.278 --> 11:22.950
Wow. It's gonna be
a real horse race
for employee of the week.

11:22.983 --> 11:26.286
( phone rings )

11:26.319 --> 11:28.922
Hello? Yes. Yes.

11:28.956 --> 11:31.024
Hi, Mrs. Van Helden,
I'm so sorry.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.293
I was just, uh,
I was just about to call you.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.228
No. No, it's just that...

11:35.262 --> 11:37.064
Well, let me just...

11:37.097 --> 11:38.799
I see...

11:43.070 --> 11:44.337
She fired us.

11:44.371 --> 11:48.408
Oh, I must go pray for you
to get your client back.

11:48.441 --> 11:52.312
It's better
from an east-facing bar.

11:52.345 --> 11:56.383
Great, so now she can drink
during work, too?

12:00.420 --> 12:05.025
Well,
to quote Morgan Freeman
in almost any movie...

12:07.094 --> 12:10.898
"You should have listened
to me, white girl."

12:10.931 --> 12:13.834
Okay, yes, we lost
our most important client.

12:13.867 --> 12:18.205
And, yes, Pam might be
partially responsible...

12:18.238 --> 12:19.873
for all of it.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.811
But what's more important,

12:23.844 --> 12:26.113
making money
or doing the right thing?

12:26.146 --> 12:28.148
Money. No, wait.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.951
Yeah, money.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.887
You know what, you're
never gonna understand.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.989
I mean, the fact is,
I'm tolerant,

12:36.023 --> 12:39.392
and you're, well,
maybe a little bit racist.

12:39.426 --> 12:43.864
How dare you
call me a racist.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.934
A homophobe, maybe.

12:46.967 --> 12:51.438
Distrustful of Spaniards,
who isn't?

12:51.471 --> 12:55.909
But nobody
calls me a racist.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.413
And you can ask
anyone I own.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.353
BEVERLEY:
Well, well, well.

13:10.023 --> 13:13.994
If it isn't
Karen Walker's
little gay friend.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.362
Where's
your olive skin cohort?

13:15.395 --> 13:20.033
Don't you homosexuals
always travel in pairs?

13:20.067 --> 13:23.036
Beverley, I'm sorry.
They don't have Clay Aiken
on the jukebox.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.274
Well, look how cute
you two are,

13:27.307 --> 13:29.910
the black stallion
and my little pony.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.347
WILL: Jack!
I need to talk to you.

13:34.381 --> 13:37.150
BEVERLEY: William!
What a surprise!

13:37.184 --> 13:39.019
I'm just having
a drink here

13:39.052 --> 13:42.055
with my business
associate Benji.

13:42.089 --> 13:44.524
The only surprise
is that you're still
trying to pass off Benji

13:44.557 --> 13:47.027
as your business associate
in the middle of a gay bar.

13:47.060 --> 13:51.064
This is a gay bar?
Well, I had no idea.

13:51.098 --> 13:54.401
I'm a half a mind
to storm out of here
right this minute.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.203
But my other half
wants to stay

13:56.236 --> 13:59.940
and finish
my refreshing
lemon drop.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.079
Travis is quite
the two-stepper, huh?

14:06.113 --> 14:07.480
Yeah, he's also
a bit of a two-timer.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.116
- What?
- Excuse us.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.984
While we were
on the dance floor,

14:11.018 --> 14:12.319
he kind of hit on me.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.521
No, he did not.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.957
You think
everybody hits on you.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.525
You blushed when the guy
at the Starbucks

14:18.558 --> 14:21.261
asked if you wanted
to leave room for cream.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.197
Hey, if you're
on the dance floor,
get in line!

14:24.231 --> 14:25.465
- No, no, no. I...
- Six, seven, eight!

14:25.498 --> 14:28.501
( country music playing )

14:33.506 --> 14:35.475
Jack, why would I lie to you?
I'm your best friend.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.010
'Cause you're jealous.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.212
The one-eyed monster
rears its ugly head.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.048
It's green.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.383
I had that once.
There's an ointment.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.120
But don't try to change
the subject.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.456
You just can't handle
me having a hot guy.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.425
Jack, listen to me.
The guy is bad news!

14:52.459 --> 14:55.028
You don't know what
you're talking about!
I'm leaving!

15:01.568 --> 15:03.336
WILL: Look,
I can't find my ticket,

15:03.370 --> 15:06.439
but I'm sure it's the only
John Varvatos cashmere car coat.

15:08.708 --> 15:09.676
No, it's not a poncho.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.413
No, it doesn't have fringe.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.983
No, it's not a poncho
with fringe.

15:16.016 --> 15:16.984
Nothing with fringe!

15:17.017 --> 15:19.552
Uh-oh!

15:19.586 --> 15:22.389
Looks like my favorite calf
has wandered away from the herd.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.292
Let me put this
in terms you'll understand.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.560
Move away from me.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.998
Hey, uh, you didn't go say
anything to Jack, did you?

15:31.031 --> 15:35.302
He's sulking with the lesbians
next door at The Big Valley.

15:35.335 --> 15:38.638
Of course I told him,
because I care about him,

15:38.671 --> 15:40.307
which obviously you do not.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.675
Excuse me, would you
take my number please

15:42.709 --> 15:44.444
and call me
if my coat shows up?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.179
How 'bout giving me
your number?

15:46.213 --> 15:48.481
You are unbelievable.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.284
You know what?
I don't find cowboys sexy.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.752
I don't even like
Ranch dressing.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.455
( phone rings )

15:55.488 --> 15:56.723
Hello.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.625
We found
your coat.

16:05.498 --> 16:06.633
Get out of my way.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.535
Well, now why you
gettin' all worked up?

16:08.568 --> 16:09.769
Jack won't care.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.738
He should be happy
he had me this long.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.606
Hey, Jack is a catch.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.742
No, the guy's a good time,
but that's it.

16:15.775 --> 16:18.378
- Don't say that.
- Oh, come on. He's an idiot.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.280
Shut up!

16:20.313 --> 16:21.514
Will,
what are you doing?

16:21.548 --> 16:23.416
- Did you just hit me?
- Yeah! I did.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.252
Your boyfriend here
is a jerk.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.487
- Ow!
- Ow!

16:27.520 --> 16:29.056
Wait a minute,
what's going on here?

16:29.089 --> 16:31.291
Gay bar fight!

16:35.462 --> 16:37.664
GRACE: I am so sorry,
Mrs. Van Helden.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.400
And--and I--I thank you
so much for giving me
another chance.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.769
Look, I'm going to send
the designs to you right now.

16:42.802 --> 16:46.005
They are all ready to go
at the fax machine. Okay.

16:52.712 --> 16:56.616
Take a picture.
It will last longer.

16:56.649 --> 17:00.487
Pam! Pam, it took me two days
to draw up those plans.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.623
It took me 18 years
to raise my plane fare
to America.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.558
Do I yell at you?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.596
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to. I...

17:09.629 --> 17:11.431
Wow, 18 years?

17:11.464 --> 17:14.101
I'm assuming
that's first class.

17:14.134 --> 17:17.370
Grace, you seem
uncomfortable around me.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.606
Is it because
I'm Middle-Eastern?

17:19.639 --> 17:24.677
No, Pam. No, I'm not
uncomfortable at all.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.779
I'm happy that I'm able
to give you this opportunity,

17:26.813 --> 17:30.550
and I believe that despite
our different backgrounds,

17:30.583 --> 17:32.085
that we can work together

17:32.119 --> 17:36.623
and help make
a more tolerant world.

17:36.656 --> 17:37.824
Excuse me.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.759
What a beautiful sentiment.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.061
I made a similar speech
at my Bat Mitzvah.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.602
Bat Mitzvah?
You're Jewish?

17:49.636 --> 17:51.771
Like brisket.

17:54.774 --> 17:58.378
Jewish?
I can't believe this!

17:58.411 --> 18:00.847
This is great!
This is wonderful!

18:00.880 --> 18:02.349
Okay, why?

18:02.382 --> 18:04.451
Because
we're both Jewish!

18:04.484 --> 18:07.387
I don't have to be
tolerant of my own kind.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.556
I don't owe you anything!

18:09.589 --> 18:12.559
What's your point?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.461
You're fired!
See you in temple!

18:21.734 --> 18:22.769
It's amazing.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.871
My first time
in a gay bar,

18:24.904 --> 18:28.875
and I see my first
gay bar fight.

18:28.908 --> 18:33.446
Your first time?
You rang the triangle.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.382
Well, I better skedaddle.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.520
Oh, by the way, I heard
what that man said about Jack.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.490
You are a true gentleman.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.725
If anybody ever called
my friend an idiot,

18:45.758 --> 18:47.760
I hope
I'd be as brave as you.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.629
Thank you, Beverley.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.698
- How 'bout a gentleman's kiss?
- I'm not that brave.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.506
Wow, we were
in a gay bar fight.

18:59.539 --> 19:03.410
I know. And oddly,
not a single punch
was thrown.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.548
Sorry I didn't believe you
about Travis.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.650
I know you wouldn't lie
to me.

19:10.683 --> 19:14.654
I just wanted to think
that a guy like that
could choose a guy like me.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.190
What does that even mean?

19:17.224 --> 19:20.193
Come on, Will,
he's kind of out of my league.

19:20.227 --> 19:23.530
Hey, are you kidding?

19:23.563 --> 19:25.498
The only reason
that you guys are
in different leagues

19:25.532 --> 19:26.766
is because he's a creep.

19:26.799 --> 19:27.800
You're way above him.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.603
You're in a league
of your own.

19:30.637 --> 19:33.440
I loved that movie.

19:35.608 --> 19:38.711
It took place
in such an innocent time,

19:38.745 --> 19:41.581
when Madonna
was still relevant,
and Rosie was still funny.

19:45.252 --> 19:45.952
Come on.
Let's go home.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.854
Oh, one more thing.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.689
I know Travis
flirted with you,

19:49.722 --> 19:51.558
but why
did you shove him?

19:51.591 --> 19:53.493
I mean, it's
just not like you.
What did he say?

19:53.526 --> 19:54.827
It was nothing.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.629
What?
Come on, tell me.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.865
- I don't even remember.
- Yes, you do.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.236
Okay, if you really
wanna know, he said...

20:04.271 --> 20:06.873
that in bright light,

20:06.906 --> 20:08.775
he thought I looked
fat and balding.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.244
What a jerk.

20:11.278 --> 20:14.647
I don't wanna date anyone
who is mean to you.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.484
And it's not true.
You still have
at least half your hair.

20:19.619 --> 20:20.820
Thank you, Jack.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.489
And you're not that fat.

20:22.522 --> 20:23.690
You just don't know
how to dress your body.

20:28.661 --> 20:29.629
Hi.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.932
I fired Pam.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.402
I should have trusted you.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.769
You were right.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.838
The only reason
I hired her

20:38.871 --> 20:42.041
was because
of my liberal guilt.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.943
Sometimes I wish
I were a Republican.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.916
Then I wouldn't have to worry
about anyone's feelings.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.754
All I'd have to worry about
is not getting indicted.

20:58.925 --> 21:02.429
Well, I'm glad you finally
came to your senses, Grace.

21:02.462 --> 21:05.732
I mean,
I could not believe

21:05.765 --> 21:07.800
what you let her
get away with.

21:07.834 --> 21:10.069
I would just sit there
cleaning my gun

21:10.102 --> 21:12.271
thinking,
"This is an office."
