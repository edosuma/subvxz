What's all the fuss about?

01:36.733 --> 01:38.400
Larry, what's the matter?

01:38.433 --> 01:40.666
I was in the middle
of a very important phone call.

01:40.700 --> 01:41.666
What were you doing?

01:41.700 --> 01:43.600
Asking your hairdresser
if you should go back to

your natural color?

For your information, Harriette,
This is my natural color.

you don't wanna go

12:04.466 --> 12:06.700
and he started a fire
with his finger.

12:09.466 --> 12:10.633
Let me smell your breath, baby.

12:10.666 --> 12:12.033
Harriette.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.033
I have not been drinking.

12:15.066 --> 12:16.433
Uh, excuse me, Larry

12:16.466 --> 12:18.600
but did you watch
all twelve hours

12:18.633 --> 12:21.200
of that horror movie marathon
last night?

12:21.233 --> 12:22.633
What's that got to do
with anything?

12:22.666 --> 12:25.466
Well, you watched
weird movies last night

12:25.500 --> 12:27.400
now you're seeing
weird things today.

12:29.133 --> 12:31.600
I suppose that could
be an explanation.

12:31.633 --> 12:34.233
You bet it could, cousin.

12:34.266 --> 12:35.433
Why did you say that?

12:35.466 --> 12:37.400
Say what?

12:37.433 --> 12:39.666
‐ You called me "cousin."
‐ No, I didn't, baby.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.166
Yes, you did.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.766
I called you baby, baby.

12:45.366 --> 12:47.566
There's no way we're cousins.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.666
Wait a minute.

12:51.700 --> 12:54.300
You two seem...different.

12:57.266 --> 12:59.066
You're just now noticing that?

13:02.266 --> 13:03.433
Relax.

13:03.466 --> 13:06.066
Th‐the next thing you know
you'll be saying that Balki's

13:06.100 --> 13:08.533
an alien and he's turning us
into aliens

13:08.566 --> 13:11.100
to take us back
to his home planet.

13:11.133 --> 13:14.066
[cackling]

13:24.133 --> 13:25.533
I'm going crazy.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.633
Too many horror movies.

13:27.666 --> 13:28.666
That's gotta be it.

13:28.700 --> 13:31.333
Uh, I just gotta relax.

13:31.366 --> 13:33.700
Just gotta relax and think
about something else.

13:35.133 --> 13:36.166
The Bears, the Bears.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.266
How are the Bears doin'?

13:50.833 --> 13:54.166
"Planet Mypos discovered
behind Pluto."

13:54.200 --> 13:56.366
‐ "Planet Mypos."
‐ Hi, cousin.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.333
Huh?

13:58.366 --> 14:00.600
‐ How did you get here?
‐ Oh, just dropped in.

14:02.433 --> 14:04.400
Well, you can't
fool me anymore.

14:04.433 --> 14:06.066
I know all about Mypos.

14:06.100 --> 14:08.533
It's right here
on the Chronicle's front page.

14:15.833 --> 14:17.600
[gasps]

14:17.633 --> 14:19.566
‐ Where were you?
‐ I never left the room.

14:21.233 --> 14:23.600
Well, maybe you won't be
so glib after you read this!

14:25.333 --> 14:28.300
"City Council
approves annual budget".

14:28.333 --> 14:30.066
You're right, cousin,
I'm glib‐less.

14:31.733 --> 14:33.566
But it was right
on the front page.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.733
Well, cousin, I think
your mind is pulling your leg.

14:35.766 --> 14:38.300
Oh, what's happening?

14:38.333 --> 14:40.800
Why am I seeing things
that aren't there?

14:40.833 --> 14:44.100
I mean what's, uh, what's, uh,
what's, uh..

14:44.833 --> 14:45.666
What's in that mail cart?

14:47.666 --> 14:50.000
The mail.
It comes at this time every day.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.733
That was a pod!

14:53.366 --> 14:55.066
Now, I get it!

14:55.100 --> 14:56.133
The fire, the milk

14:56.166 --> 14:58.166
walking through doors,
it's all coming together.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.233
You are a strange visitor
from another planet

15:00.266 --> 15:02.066
who came to Earth
with powers and abilities

15:02.100 --> 15:03.566
far beyond that
of mortal man, and who

15:03.600 --> 15:06.200
disguised as Balki Bartokomous,
mild‐mannered sheepherder

15:06.233 --> 15:08.133
working for a great
metropolitan newspaper

15:08.166 --> 15:09.533
is turning us all into Mypiots

15:09.566 --> 15:11.633
so you can take us back
to your planet!

15:13.100 --> 15:14.566
Darn, you got me.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.533
[gasps]

15:16.566 --> 15:18.500
You mean it's true?

15:19.200 --> 15:20.500
Yepper.

15:21.633 --> 15:23.633
I may be an alien bent on

15:23.666 --> 15:25.766
world conquest but I'm no liar.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.500
Cousin, you're gonna love Mypos.

15:28.533 --> 15:30.133
The climate is perfect.

15:30.166 --> 15:32.300
All men are created cousins

15:32.333 --> 15:34.666
and we've conquered cellulite.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.400
I'm not going to another planet.

15:36.433 --> 15:38.533
Oh, come on, cousin, I..

15:38.566 --> 15:40.600
I always go
where you want to go.

15:40.633 --> 15:42.666
I don't want to go to Mypos,
I'll never go to Mypos.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.433
Nothing you can do
or say will ever make me

15:44.466 --> 15:46.266
want to go to Mypos.

15:48.666 --> 15:50.700
Cousin, you want to go to Mypos.

15:50.733 --> 15:52.500
I want to go to Mypos.

15:54.466 --> 15:57.366
When the mama ship gets here,
you'll be the first one in line.

15:57.400 --> 16:00.633
When the mama ship gets here,
I'll be the first in line.

16:01.700 --> 16:04.633
And when we say,
"Who wants pig snout?"

16:06.133 --> 16:08.233
You'd say, "I do! I do!"

16:08.266 --> 16:09.633
And when you say

16:09.666 --> 16:11.566
"Who wants pig snout?"

16:11.600 --> 16:14.200
I'll say..

16:14.233 --> 16:15.466
I'll say..

16:17.100 --> 16:18.433
Ugh.

16:18.466 --> 16:20.700
I'll never eat pig snout!

16:24.366 --> 16:27.666
You have a very strong will,
Earth boy.

16:29.833 --> 16:32.433
Balki, how can you
do this to the Earth?

16:32.466 --> 16:34.100
You used to be so nice.

16:34.133 --> 16:37.133
Well, we Mypiots were nice

16:37.166 --> 16:38.800
for 6,000 years

16:38.833 --> 16:41.233
and then one day,
somebody suggested

16:41.266 --> 16:45.033
"Hey, why you don't watch
scary movies?

16:45.733 --> 16:47.400
"They won't hurt you..

16:47.433 --> 16:49.500
...they just go in one eye
and out the other."

16:51.366 --> 16:55.000
Well, they checked in
but they didn't check out.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.700
They set up housekeeping.

17:00.333 --> 17:03.766
They begat bad thoughts.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.366
And those bad thoughts
got together

17:06.400 --> 17:08.733
and had little bad thoughts.

17:09.766 --> 17:12.300
And those little bad thoughts

17:12.333 --> 17:17.400
grew up into big bad thoughts.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.800
And now, all we have

17:24.833 --> 17:28.733
are big bad thoughts.

17:28.766 --> 17:31.533
So, we're taking over the Earth

17:31.566 --> 17:33.633
just for kicks!

17:33.666 --> 17:35.600
[evil laughter]

17:42.433 --> 17:44.433
[instrumental music]

17:45.233 --> 17:46.300
[panting]

17:55.166 --> 17:56.733
Hello, Jennifer? It's Larry.

17:56.766 --> 17:58.733
Drop whatever you're doing
and get down here.

17:58.766 --> 18:00.100
[knocking on door]

18:00.133 --> 18:02.033
‐ Who is it?
‐ 'It's Jennifer.'

18:09.166 --> 18:10.533
How did you get here so fast?

18:10.566 --> 18:12.466
You sounded upset so I hurried.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.566
What's wrong?

18:20.066 --> 18:22.166
I have proof that Balki

18:22.200 --> 18:23.533
is from a planet called Mypos

18:23.566 --> 18:24.533
and they're taking over
the Earth.

18:24.566 --> 18:26.166
You've got to believe me.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.066
‐ Larry, I believe you.
‐ You do?

18:28.533 --> 18:30.633
Why?

18:30.666 --> 18:32.266
Well, for one thing

18:32.300 --> 18:35.166
Balki is floating
outside the window.

18:38.333 --> 18:40.166
No, no, don't let him in.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.666
We've got to leave right now.

18:41.700 --> 18:42.733
There's no hurry.

18:42.766 --> 18:43.800
What do you mean,
"There's no hurry?"

18:43.833 --> 18:46.533
If we stay we'll become Mypiots!

18:47.633 --> 18:49.733
Is that really so bad, cousin?

18:52.800 --> 18:56.100
You're wearing a vest.
You're one of them!

18:58.166 --> 19:00.100
[panting]

19:01.366 --> 19:02.700
(all)
Hi, cousin.

19:02.733 --> 19:04.500
Going somewhere?

19:09.133 --> 19:10.233
Time to go.

19:10.266 --> 19:12.033
The mama ship is double‐parked.

19:12.066 --> 19:14.333
[laughs]

19:17.066 --> 19:19.333
You mean he's changed
you all into Mypiots?

19:19.366 --> 19:22.133
(all)
Well, of course he has,
don't be ridiculous.

19:24.233 --> 19:25.466
Let me give you a hand, cousin.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.700
Oh, no.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.233
I'm not falling
for that one again.

19:28.266 --> 19:29.600
You'll never take me.

19:29.633 --> 19:32.100
Oh, come on, cousin.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.233
Be one of us.

19:40.700 --> 19:43.000
Put on the vest.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.433
‐ Alterations are free.
‐ No.

19:46.466 --> 19:48.066
No, no, no.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.200
[panting]

19:51.466 --> 19:53.566
Get away. Get away.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.000
[evil laughter]

19:58.133 --> 19:59.600
Oh, no. Oh, no.

19:59.633 --> 20:02.366
(all)
Cousin. Cousin. Cousin.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.633
‐ Cousin, cousin‐‐
‐ Get away, get away.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.266
‐ Cousin.
‐ Ah. Huh!

20:10.300 --> 20:12.100
Huh, don't come any closer!

20:12.133 --> 20:14.066
How would that be possible?

20:15.733 --> 20:17.766
You'll never put that vest
on me.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.700
But, cousin,
I wasn't thinking of it.

20:19.733 --> 20:21.300
It don't go with
the knife in your chest.

20:21.333 --> 20:23.200
What?

20:23.233 --> 20:25.066
[shrieks]

20:25.100 --> 20:26.700
Oh. Oh.

20:26.733 --> 20:28.566
I've got a knife in my chest.

20:28.600 --> 20:29.633
Oh, that's great.

20:29.666 --> 20:31.800
Oh. Oh..

20:31.833 --> 20:33.233
I must have fallen asleep

20:33.266 --> 20:35.200
in front of the television!

20:35.233 --> 20:37.166
Cousin, I think you
were having a bad dream.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.533
Oh, I was.

20:38.566 --> 20:40.566
And, Balki, it was awful.

20:40.600 --> 20:44.066
In my dream, you were
from a‐a planet called Mypos

20:44.100 --> 20:46.300
and‐and you were
taking over the Earth.

20:46.333 --> 20:48.500
And that wasn't the awful part.

20:48.533 --> 20:51.266
The awful part was
that you were not nice.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.600
[chuckles]

20:53.633 --> 20:54.600
Can you imagine that?

20:54.633 --> 20:56.600
Balki Bartokomous, not nice?

20:56.633 --> 20:58.766
[chuckling]

21:02.100 --> 21:05.000
Balki, uh, just
for argument's sake, uh..

21:06.433 --> 21:09.466
...what would you do if a total
stranger came up to you

21:09.500 --> 21:12.366
on the street
and took your money

21:12.400 --> 21:15.033
kicked you in the shins and said
your mama wears army boots?

21:16.833 --> 21:19.166
Well, um..

21:19.200 --> 21:21.400
...if he, uh, took my money

21:21.433 --> 21:24.333
I'd say, "Spend it wisely."

21:24.366 --> 21:26.800
And if he kicked me
in the shins, I'd say

21:26.833 --> 21:29.266
"You know, you should join a gym
to find a more

21:29.300 --> 21:31.333
positive way
of taking out aggression."

21:33.266 --> 21:36.733
And if he says
my mama wears army boots

21:36.766 --> 21:39.766
then I'd say, "You've seen mama?
How does she look?"

21:43.666 --> 21:46.133
You are Balki. Uh‐huh..

21:46.166 --> 21:47.100
Ow.

21:51.600 --> 21:52.733
‐ Oh.
‐ Cousin.

21:54.433 --> 21:56.133
Well..

21:56.166 --> 21:58.300
Balki.. Woop!

22:02.300 --> 22:04.600
Balki, I never want to have

22:04.633 --> 22:07.066
a nightmare like that again.

22:07.100 --> 22:08.066
‐ Observation.
‐ Hmm?

22:08.100 --> 22:10.100
If you hadn't watched
all those scary movies

22:10.133 --> 22:11.666
you wouldn't have
had that bad dream.

22:11.700 --> 22:14.766
Well, you know,
ever since my parents

22:14.800 --> 22:18.033
took me out of "Fantasia"
crying..

22:18.066 --> 22:20.533
...I've been trying
to prove something.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.566
Well, cousin,
you did prove something.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.400
You proved
that if you watch twelve hours

22:26.433 --> 22:29.200
of scary movies,
then you have a nightmare.

22:29.233 --> 22:32.100
Of course, the rest of us
already knew that.

22:32.133 --> 22:33.700
That's why you were
watching them alone.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.433
Well, why learn the easy way

22:37.466 --> 22:39.166
when you can learn the hard way?

22:39.200 --> 22:42.266
Well, that's the motto
you live by.

22:45.366 --> 22:47.266
Balki, what do you say,
next Halloween

22:47.300 --> 22:50.333
we just hand out candy
to the kids and call it a night?

22:50.366 --> 22:53.233
Okay by me.
Now, how about this?

22:53.266 --> 22:55.100
We clean up this place,
I make you some breakfast

22:55.133 --> 22:56.500
and you start to feel better.

22:56.533 --> 22:57.466
Okay.

22:59.066 --> 23:01.333
Boy, what a nightmare.

23:01.366 --> 23:04.566
Huh. I, it‐it was
the craziest thing.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.400
I, every time I turned around..

23:09.300 --> 23:11.033
...you were gone.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.566
Balki?

23:17.600 --> 23:19.766
‐ Cousin?
‐ Huh!

23:19.800 --> 23:22.733
[instrumental music]

23:28.133 --> 23:30.433
[theme music]
