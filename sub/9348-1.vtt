00:40.534 --> 00:43.203
Bobby-boy,
stay while mommy picks up free cheese.

00:45.205 --> 00:47.457
This will keep the sun out of your eyes

00:47.624 --> 00:49.334
Be good.

00:55.716 --> 00:57.801
Don't you fucking move,
you little shit machine.

00:57.968 --> 00:59.553
Mama's gonna try to score.

01:04.641 --> 01:07.561
Excuse me, who's watching these babies?

01:07.811 --> 01:10.022
The fat one's watching the little one?

01:10.063 --> 01:12.315
Nice parenting.

01:12.566 --> 01:14.818
Leave them out here like that
and see what happens.

01:14.901 --> 01:17.112
Fuck you, you fucking square!

01:17.320 --> 01:19.031
Yeah, keep on trucking.

01:19.239 --> 01:21.658
Did you hear the fucking guy tell me
how to fucking raise you?

01:21.825 --> 01:23.118
What a fucker man.

01:23.326 --> 01:24.578
Who does he think he fucking is?

01:24.745 --> 01:25.620
What's the worst
that could fucking happen to you

01:25.746 --> 01:27.831
standing in front of a store?

01:27.998 --> 01:29.082
Fuck!

01:31.918 --> 01:33.545
Fuck.

01:34.338 --> 01:36.965
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

01:37.090 --> 01:40.218
Fuck, fuck, mother-motherfuck-
mother-motherfuck-fuck.

01:40.344 --> 01:42.304
Motherfuck, motherfuck- no inch,
no inch, no inch.

01:42.512 --> 01:44.264
One, two, one-two-three-four.

01:44.431 --> 01:46.016
No inch, no inch, no inch, no inch,

01:46.266 --> 01:49.603
Smoking weed, smoking weed,
doing coke, drinking beers.

01:49.770 --> 01:53.440
Drinking beers, beers, beers.
Rolling fatties, smoking blunts.

01:53.690 --> 01:55.400
Who smokes the blunts?
We smoke the blunts.

01:58.278 --> 01:59.905
Let me have a nickel bag.

02:00.030 --> 02:03.825
Fifteen bucks, little man.
Put that shit in my hand.

02:03.950 --> 02:07.704
If that money doesn't show,
then you owe me, owe me, owe.

02:07.788 --> 02:11.500
My Jungle Love.
Oh-wee-oh-wee-oh!

02:11.708 --> 02:14.169
I think I want to know you, know you.

02:14.211 --> 02:16.713
What the hell are you singing?

02:16.880 --> 02:18.507
You don't know "Jungle Love"?

02:18.799 --> 02:20.008
That shit is the mad notes.

02:20.050 --> 02:21.301
Written by God herself...

02:21.551 --> 02:24.513
and handed down to
the greatest band in the world.

02:24.721 --> 02:26.556
The motherfucking Time.

02:26.723 --> 02:28.308
You mean the guys in that Prince movie?

02:28.475 --> 02:29.351
Yeah, "Purple Rain."

02:29.559 --> 02:32.437
That shit was so gay.
Fucking 80's style.

02:35.565 --> 02:37.984
Don't never say an unkind word
about "The Time".

02:38.068 --> 02:40.529
Me and Silent Bob modeled our
whole fucking lives...

02:40.737 --> 02:41.863
around Morris Day and Jerome.

02:42.072 --> 02:44.991
I'm a smooth pimp
who loves the pussy...

02:45.075 --> 02:47.995
and tubby here is my black man-servant.

02:48.120 --> 02:48.870
What?

02:49.079 --> 02:51.206
What did tell you two about
dealing in front of the store?

02:51.415 --> 02:54.876
Drop the kid and pedal your
wares someplace else, burn-boy.

02:56.253 --> 02:59.172
And for the record,
"The Time" sucked ass.

03:01.174 --> 03:05.220
Want to hear something fucked up
about him and that Quick-Stop boy?

03:07.681 --> 03:09.182
Are you supposed to be here today?

03:09.266 --> 03:10.767
Don't get me started.

03:10.934 --> 03:12.936
Can't we do something
about those two stoners...

03:13.103 --> 03:14.771
hanging around outside
the store all the time?

03:15.022 --> 03:16.148
Why? What did they do now?

03:16.356 --> 03:18.108
I'm trying to watch
"Clash Of The Titans"

03:18.275 --> 03:18.859
and all I can hear is...

03:19.026 --> 03:21.486
those two screaming about
Morris Day at the top of their lungs.

03:21.695 --> 03:23.989
I thought the fat one
didn't talk that much.

03:24.031 --> 03:26.324
What, am I producing
an A & E biography about them?

03:26.616 --> 03:30.203
Two packs of wraps.
How is the service?

03:30.370 --> 03:32.039
What service?

03:32.122 --> 03:33.790
The one at the Unitarian Church
last week...

03:33.957 --> 03:35.876
where you two got married to each other

03:36.043 --> 03:37.461
What the hell are you talking about?

03:37.627 --> 03:39.421
Jay said you guys had a
"Star Wars" theme wedding...

03:39.629 --> 03:41.840
and you tied the knot
dressed like Storm Troopers.

03:41.965 --> 03:44.176
And he says you're the bitch
and you're butch.

03:44.301 --> 03:45.594
I'm the bitch?

03:45.719 --> 03:47.304
If we were gay,
that's the way I'd se it.

03:47.471 --> 03:48.347
Will you shut up?

03:48.472 --> 03:50.849
Holy shit, dude-the honeymoon's over.

03:51.058 --> 03:52.517
That does it.

03:52.642 --> 03:54.978
I am gonna do something about
these two stoner fucks...

03:55.145 --> 03:56.938
I should've done a long time ago.

03:59.149 --> 04:00.901
What the fuck, Serpico? What'd we do?

04:01.068 --> 04:04.529
We got a report of two guys hanging
around a store selling pot.

04:04.738 --> 04:06.323
We don't smoke pot.

04:06.490 --> 04:09.242
No pot? What do you use this for?

04:09.409 --> 04:12.412
I have a wiping problem,
I stick those little pieces of paper...

04:12.496 --> 04:15.415
over my brown eye and bam!
- No shit stains on my undies.

04:15.582 --> 04:17.209
You don't believe me? I'll show you.

04:17.668 --> 04:18.418
Check this out.

04:18.668 --> 04:20.796
Just spread my cheeks and
you can see the stink nuggets.

04:20.921 --> 04:23.048
Pull up your fucking pants, sir.

04:23.256 --> 04:25.175
Now!

04:25.926 --> 04:28.679
Let's go.
We're going down to the station.

04:28.762 --> 04:31.473
What, is it a crime to fart?
Motherfucker

04:32.516 --> 04:34.017
No fucking way!

04:34.267 --> 04:36.978
Dante and Randal slapped you
with a restraining order?

04:37.187 --> 04:38.855
Ain't that about a bitch?

04:38.939 --> 04:40.607
Are you gonna abide by
the court's ruling...

04:40.774 --> 04:42.859
or are you gonna go bandit,
Reynold's style?

04:43.026 --> 04:45.320
Judge said if we go within
a hundred feet of the store...

04:45.529 --> 04:47.030
we get thrown into County.

04:47.197 --> 04:48.865
You know what they make you do
in County?

04:49.032 --> 04:51.076
Toss the salad.

04:51.159 --> 04:53.161
If you guys really wanted to hang out
in front of a convenience store...

04:53.370 --> 04:56.081
you could buy your own with all that
money you guys made.

04:56.289 --> 04:58.333
Hell, yeah, bitch.

04:58.458 --> 04:59.751
Wait a second-what money?

04:59.918 --> 05:02.671
The money from the Bluntman
And Chronic movie.

05:06.383 --> 05:08.677
Oh my God,
don't tell me you have no idea...

05:08.802 --> 05:10.804
that there's a movie being made of
the comic...

05:10.971 --> 05:13.015
you two were the basis for?

05:13.181 --> 05:15.434
What? Since when?

05:15.642 --> 05:19.396
Here's the pulse.
And this is your finger...

05:19.604 --> 05:22.649
far from the pulse,
jammed straight up your ass.

05:23.900 --> 05:26.611
Would you like
a chocolate covered pretzel?

05:27.821 --> 05:32.451
If you read Wizard, you'd know
that it's the top story this month.

05:32.701 --> 05:34.077
Check it out.

05:36.496 --> 05:37.873
When the fuck did this happen?

05:38.081 --> 05:39.916
After-X-Men hit at the box office...

05:40.083 --> 05:42.294
all the studios started buying
every comic property...

05:42.377 --> 05:44.588
they could get their dirty
little hands on.

05:44.838 --> 05:47.257
Miramax optioned Bluntman And Chronic.

05:47.424 --> 05:47.883
Miramax?

05:48.091 --> 05:50.344
I thought
they only made classy pictures...

05:50.427 --> 05:52.554
like The Piano, or The Crying Game.

05:52.763 --> 05:55.682
Once they made She's All That,
everything went to hell.

05:55.849 --> 05:58.894
You're saying you haven't gotten
a monetary cut of the movie?

05:59.102 --> 06:00.896
Didn't Holden McNeil
and Banky Edwards...

06:00.937 --> 06:02.689
used to pay you likeness rights
for the comic book?

06:02.939 --> 06:05.317
We haven't seen a fucking dime
for no movie.

06:05.525 --> 06:08.487
I'm no lawyer,
but I think Holden and Banky...

06:08.695 --> 06:11.448
owe you some of that proverbial
"fat cash".

06:11.531 --> 06:13.658
If I was you guys,
I'd find Holden McNeil...

06:13.867 --> 06:15.494
and ask for my movie check.

06:15.702 --> 06:18.080
Shit, yeah, we gots to get paid!

06:18.288 --> 06:20.749
And on that note, we cue the music.

06:37.641 --> 06:41.645
Look at these morose motherfuckers
right here.

06:41.812 --> 06:46.733
Smells like somebody shit
in their cereal. Bunngg!

06:47.567 --> 06:49.236
Come on in.

06:50.237 --> 06:52.739
What brings you two dirt merchants
to my neck of the woods?

06:52.989 --> 06:55.283
I'll tell you what our necks are
doing in your woods.

06:55.409 --> 06:57.244
Where's our motherfucking movie check?

06:57.327 --> 06:59.162
You heard about that, huh?

06:59.329 --> 06:59.997
I got nothing to do with it.

07:00.247 --> 07:00.747
That's Banky's deal.

07:00.914 --> 07:01.540
He owns the property now.

07:01.748 --> 07:04.459
I sold my half of the Bluntman and
Chronic rights to him years ago.

07:04.584 --> 07:06.586
Why the fuck would you do
a thing like that?

07:06.753 --> 07:10.298
Why in Gods' name would I want to
keep writing about characters...

07:10.424 --> 07:13.885
whose central preoccupation is weed
and dick and fart jokes.

07:14.094 --> 07:16.263
You gotta grow, man.

07:16.513 --> 07:18.849
Don't you want anything more
for yourself?

07:18.932 --> 07:21.226
I know this poor hapless son of
a bitch does.

07:22.769 --> 07:26.064
I look into his sorry, doe eyes and
I see a man crying out.

07:26.356 --> 07:27.733
He's crying out "When, Lord?"

07:27.941 --> 07:30.235
When the fuck can your servant...

07:30.444 --> 07:32.988
ditch this foul mouthed
little chucklehead...

07:33.196 --> 07:35.657
to whom I am a constant victim of
his folly.

07:35.782 --> 07:38.118
So much so that it prevents me
from ever getting a girl.

07:38.285 --> 07:39.786
Fuck! When, Lord, when?

07:39.953 --> 07:41.872
When's gonna be my time?

07:45.375 --> 07:46.335
He knows.

07:46.543 --> 07:47.919
I'm the chucklehead?

07:48.128 --> 07:49.338
You're the fucking dumb ass...

07:49.463 --> 07:50.464
who gave your comic away.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.924
Now you don't get no
fucking movie check neither.

07:53.133 --> 07:54.509
When you're right, you're right.

07:54.634 --> 07:56.636
I wish I'd held on to a little piece
of that thing because...

07:56.803 --> 08:00.015
if the buzz is any sign, that movie's
gonna make some huge bank.

08:00.223 --> 08:01.600
What buzz?

08:01.808 --> 08:02.893
The internet buzz.

08:03.060 --> 08:05.187
What the fuck is the internet?

08:05.395 --> 08:07.731
The internet is a communications
tool used the world over...

08:07.981 --> 08:09.733
where people can come together
to bitch about movies...

08:09.900 --> 08:10.817
and share pornography.

08:10.984 --> 08:14.196
Like this-Movie Poop Shoot-dot-com.

08:14.404 --> 08:15.989
Poop shoot, yeah.

08:16.573 --> 08:18.950
This is a site populated
by militant movie buffs.

08:19.159 --> 08:22.579
Sad, pathetic little bastards living
in their parents' basement...

08:22.746 --> 08:26.041
downloading scripts and what
they think is inside information...

08:26.249 --> 08:28.835
about movies and actors that
they claim to despise yet...

08:29.002 --> 08:30.087
can't stop discussing.

08:30.337 --> 08:32.130
Okay, this is about Bluntman & Chronic.

08:32.255 --> 08:35.717
"Inside sources tell me Miramax is
starting production this Friday..."

08:35.926 --> 08:39.096
"on their adaptation of underground
comic fav Bluntman & Chronic."

08:39.346 --> 08:40.054
Friday? Shit.

08:40.263 --> 08:41.932
Does it say who's playing us
in the movie?

08:42.099 --> 08:43.015
No, but it's Miramax,

08:43.183 --> 08:45.477
so I'm sure
it'll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.

08:45.686 --> 08:46.978
They put them in a bunch of movies.

08:47.187 --> 08:47.688
Who?

08:47.854 --> 08:49.815
Those kids from "Good Will Hunting".

08:49.940 --> 08:52.067
You mean that fucking movie
with Mork from Ork in it?

08:52.109 --> 08:54.152
I wasn't a big fan either.

08:54.361 --> 08:56.738
But Affleck was the bomb in "Phantoms".

08:57.030 --> 08:59.616
Word, bitch.
"Phantoms" was a motherfucker!

09:02.619 --> 09:03.787
Here we go.

09:03.870 --> 09:05.038
This is the shoot back section.

09:05.205 --> 09:08.500
This is where the people get to
chime in with their two cents.

09:08.625 --> 09:12.212
Here's a guy with
the chick-magnet name "Wampa One"...

09:12.379 --> 09:15.048
opining on what he thinks about
Bluntman & Chronic.

09:15.215 --> 09:15.882
He says...

09:16.049 --> 09:18.135
"Bluntman & Chronic and their stupid
alter egos Jay & Silent Bob...

09:18.218 --> 09:20.303
"only work in small doses, if at all."

09:20.512 --> 09:22.389
"They don't deserve their own movie."

09:22.597 --> 09:23.181
He's got a point.

09:23.348 --> 09:24.808
Fuck him. What's the next one say?

09:25.017 --> 09:26.893
This is entitled
"Fuck Them Up Their Stupid Asses".

09:27.102 --> 09:29.771
"Bluntman & Chronic is the
worst comic I ever read."

09:29.980 --> 09:32.065
"Jay & Silent Bob
are stupid characters."

09:32.315 --> 09:34.693
"A couple of stoners who spout
dumb ass catch phrases..."

09:34.735 --> 09:37.112
"like a third rate Cheech & Chong,
or Bill & Ted."

09:37.320 --> 09:42.409
"Fuck Jay & Silent Bob!
Fuck them up their stupid asses!"

09:42.576 --> 09:44.369
Who the fuck said that shit?

09:44.536 --> 09:47.497
He calls himself Magnolia Fan.
Check this one out.

09:47.581 --> 09:50.459
"Jay & Silent Bob are one-note jokes
that only stoners laugh at."

09:50.625 --> 09:53.587
"They are fucking clown shoes."

09:53.754 --> 09:57.507
"If they were real I'd beat the shit
out of them for being so stupid."

09:57.632 --> 10:00.177
"I will be boycotting this movie.
Who is with me?"

10:00.344 --> 10:02.637
Then there's fifty more posts
of people...

10:02.846 --> 10:04.514
who are joining this guy's boycott.

10:04.765 --> 10:07.309
I'm gonna kill all these fucks.

10:07.434 --> 10:09.978
Let it go.
They're not talking about you guys.

10:10.103 --> 10:11.855
They're talking about
Bluntman & Chronic.

10:14.191 --> 10:15.359
But they said Jay & Silent Bob.

10:15.525 --> 10:16.526
They used our real names.

10:16.693 --> 10:18.695
It doesn't matter
if there's a comic version...

10:18.904 --> 10:21.740
because no one knows we're real
in real life.

10:21.948 --> 10:25.744
And all the people reading that
shit think the real Jay & Silent Bob...

10:25.911 --> 10:28.163
are a couple of jerk-offs
because of what these dick-heads...

10:28.330 --> 10:30.499
are writing about
the comic Jay & Silent Bob.

10:30.707 --> 10:34.211
Maybe one night me and lunch-box
are making some chick and she says...

10:34.419 --> 10:37.589
"Oooh, I want to suck your dicks off.

10:37.798 --> 10:39.257
What're your names?"

10:39.466 --> 10:42.386
And I say
"Jay & Silent Bob. Recognize."

10:42.552 --> 10:44.554
And she says
"I read on the internet that..."

10:44.721 --> 10:47.974
"you guys were a couple of
little fucking jerk-offs."

10:48.141 --> 10:50.769
And then she goes and sucks
two other guys dicks off instead.

10:50.894 --> 10:52.688
Fuck that!

10:52.896 --> 10:54.564
We got to put a stop to
these fucking hateful...

10:54.815 --> 10:57.526
sons of bitches before they ruin
our good names.

10:57.734 --> 10:59.486
First of all, I don't know
how good your names are...

10:59.653 --> 11:02.197
and second, there's not much you can do
about stopping this bile.

11:02.322 --> 11:03.824
The internet has given everyone
in America a voice...

11:03.990 --> 11:06.410
and everyone in America
has chosen to use that voice...

11:06.576 --> 11:07.411
to bitch about movies.

11:07.577 --> 11:08.829
As long as
there's Bluntman & Chronic movie...

11:08.996 --> 11:12.207
the net nerds are gonna have
something negative to say.

11:12.416 --> 11:13.417
Wait a second.

11:13.667 --> 11:16.128
If there wasn't
a Bluntman & Chronic movie...

11:16.169 --> 11:18.630
then those fuckers wouldn't be saying
shit about Jay & Silent Bob.

11:18.922 --> 11:21.383
They're not saying anything
about you now.

11:21.466 --> 11:23.969
They're talking
about fictional characters.

11:24.177 --> 11:26.638
Fictional characters.

11:26.847 --> 11:29.850
Am I getting through to you at all?

11:29.933 --> 11:32.894
So all we gotta do is stop
the fucking movie from getting made.

11:33.103 --> 11:36.314
And forego the hundreds
of thousands of dollars...

11:36.523 --> 11:38.567
that you two would be entitled to
in the process.

11:38.775 --> 11:40.027
Are you fucking retarded?

11:40.193 --> 11:42.904
I don't think I'm alone in the world...

11:43.113 --> 11:45.907
Greedo shooting first.

11:46.116 --> 11:49.494
A Jay & Silent Bob movie?

11:49.703 --> 11:52.456
Who'd pay to see that?

11:56.626 --> 11:58.795
But, since it appears inevitable,
I recommend that you...

11:58.962 --> 12:02.424
go hunt Banky down and get
your mother fucking movie check...

12:02.632 --> 12:05.260
as you succinctly put it,
because that's what's important, right?

12:05.469 --> 12:08.138
No, Holden McNeil.

12:08.305 --> 12:10.724
The important thing here
is a bunch of mother fuckers...

12:10.974 --> 12:13.643
we don't even know calling us
assholes on the internet...

12:13.727 --> 12:16.438
to teenagers and guys
who can't even get laid.

12:16.646 --> 12:19.399
Putting a stop to that is the most
important thing we could ever do.

12:19.483 --> 12:22.069
When is this movie getting made?

12:22.235 --> 12:23.528
They start this Friday.

12:23.737 --> 12:27.824
So, if today is Tuesday,
that gives us...

12:29.660 --> 12:31.244
eight days.

12:31.411 --> 12:33.246
Three by my count, but close.

12:33.413 --> 12:35.082
My bad.

12:35.248 --> 12:38.502
Three days to stop that fucking
stupid movie from getting made.

12:38.669 --> 12:41.505
C'mon, Silent Bob-
we're going to Hollywood.

13:03.610 --> 13:04.236
Tickets?

13:04.444 --> 13:06.613
Since when did they start charging
for the bus?

13:06.780 --> 13:09.992
Didn't we used to ride that shit to
school every morning for free?

13:14.037 --> 13:14.997
This sucks balls, man.

13:15.205 --> 13:17.124
How come we ain't getting no rides?

13:17.874 --> 13:20.335
Because you're doing it all wrong.

13:21.628 --> 13:25.298
You gotta give
the driver a little incentive.

13:25.549 --> 13:26.758
Like how?

13:26.967 --> 13:28.093
Like this.

13:30.554 --> 13:31.930
But what happens when they pick
you up and you don't...

13:31.972 --> 13:33.348
make with the head?

13:33.557 --> 13:34.975
Don't they kick your ass to the curb?

13:35.142 --> 13:37.811
Sure, if you don't make with the head.

13:41.815 --> 13:45.360
Yeah. If it'll get me a couple
hundred miles across the country...

13:45.569 --> 13:47.863
I'll take a shot in the mouth.

13:48.071 --> 13:49.531
But we ain't gay.

13:49.740 --> 13:52.075
Don't be so suburban.

13:52.242 --> 13:53.535
It's the new millennium.

13:53.744 --> 13:56.830
Gay, straight- it's all the same now.

13:56.997 --> 13:59.124
There are no more lines.

13:59.750 --> 14:02.627
There's a line,
and on the side of it we ain't gay.

14:02.753 --> 14:05.464
All the hitchers do this.

14:05.756 --> 14:07.674
Why do you think people pick us up?

14:07.841 --> 14:09.885
If you get a ride, it's expected.

14:10.010 --> 14:12.304
I don't care who the driver is.

14:12.512 --> 14:15.515
It's the first rule in the book.

14:15.682 --> 14:17.184
What book?

14:17.351 --> 14:20.187
The unwritten book of the road.

14:36.203 --> 14:38.497
Follow the rules of the book...

14:38.538 --> 14:40.791
and you'll get
where you're going in no time.

14:40.957 --> 14:42.668
Excuse me.

15:10.904 --> 15:12.364
You both don't have to sit back there.

15:12.489 --> 15:15.117
Why doesn't one of you come sit
next to me?

15:22.165 --> 15:23.458
Where are you boys from?

15:23.667 --> 15:25.002
New Jersey.

15:25.002 --> 15:26.294
But we're on our way to Hollywood.

15:26.503 --> 15:29.339
Hollywood, huh? That's far away.

15:29.506 --> 15:31.633
Thank God you picked us up.

15:31.842 --> 15:35.303
Do unto others-
that's what the book says.

15:35.595 --> 15:37.848
Wait a second- you follow the book too?

15:38.098 --> 15:40.058
I live my life by it.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.060
- You?
- Of course.

15:42.269 --> 15:45.313
So you live by the book, too?

15:45.522 --> 15:48.984
You picked us up, didn't you?
I have to.

15:49.609 --> 15:50.777
That's good to hear...

15:51.028 --> 15:54.281
but it's a lot easier to say
you live by the book...

15:54.448 --> 15:56.783
than to actually do it.

15:56.950 --> 16:00.954
Can you do it?
All right.

16:20.307 --> 16:21.516
I can't believe this shit.

16:21.725 --> 16:22.934
Five hours and not a single ride.

16:23.143 --> 16:26.521
Every day people hitch to Hollywood...

16:26.646 --> 16:29.649
but when you and me try it's like
we're trapped in a fucking cartoon.

16:46.750 --> 16:48.418
Zoinks.

16:48.585 --> 16:50.504
Now we can finally solve the mystery
of the hitchhiking ghouls.

16:50.754 --> 16:52.964
Pull off their masks and let's see
who they really are.

16:53.590 --> 16:54.591
I don't think they are masks.

16:54.758 --> 16:57.469
And I don't think
they're hitchhiking girls, either.

16:57.678 --> 16:59.888
Ghouls, you fucking moron, not girls.

17:00.097 --> 17:02.557
I wish they were hitchhiking girl.

17:02.683 --> 17:05.102
Sexy, hitchhiking girls.

17:05.268 --> 17:06.060
Let's kick them out.

17:06.185 --> 17:07.561
We have a mystery to solve.

17:07.771 --> 17:09.981
The only mystery here is
why we take our cues...

17:10.190 --> 17:12.401
from a dick in a neckerchief.

17:12.608 --> 17:13.318
Keep it up, beatnik.

17:13.443 --> 17:14.694
I'll feed you to the fucking dog.

17:14.861 --> 17:17.571
I can't take all this fighting.

17:20.617 --> 17:22.911
You guys need to turn those
frowns upside down.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.163
And I got just the thing for that.

17:25.955 --> 17:27.665
We call it...

17:27.874 --> 17:29.793
doobie snacks.

17:52.232 --> 17:54.401
Hi, Jay and Silent Bob.

17:59.573 --> 18:00.907
I think they passed out.

18:01.158 --> 18:03.535
Great. What do we do with them now?

18:03.744 --> 18:06.038
Let's cut out their kidneys
and sell them on the black market...

18:06.246 --> 18:09.166
and leave them in
a seedy motel bathtub full of ice.

18:18.175 --> 18:18.884
You see something?

18:19.092 --> 18:20.510
Anything?

18:20.677 --> 18:22.929
I had a horrible dream.

18:24.765 --> 18:25.599
Man, I'm hungry.

18:25.849 --> 18:27.642
Where can we get some breakfast?

18:39.613 --> 18:40.781
Yeah.

18:47.704 --> 18:49.331
Check that shit out.

18:49.456 --> 18:50.415
The internet.

18:50.582 --> 18:52.042
Let's see if those fucks wrote
something new about us...

18:52.209 --> 18:53.543
or that stupid-ass flick.

18:56.963 --> 19:00.425
"Any movie based on Jay and Silent Bob
are gonna lick balls..."

19:00.592 --> 19:02.928
"because they both, in fact,
lick balls."

19:03.136 --> 19:04.429
Mother fucker.

19:04.638 --> 19:06.264
It's time we wrote something back.

19:06.473 --> 19:07.391
Type this shit down.

19:08.809 --> 19:10.977
All you mother fuckers are gonna pay.

19:11.228 --> 19:14.439
You are the ones
who are the ball lickers.

19:14.648 --> 19:17.150
We're gonna fuck your mothers
while you watch and cry...

19:17.401 --> 19:18.735
like little whiny bitches.

19:18.860 --> 19:20.195
One we get to Hollywood...

19:20.404 --> 19:22.614
and find those Miramax fucks
who are making the movie...

19:22.781 --> 19:26.201
we're gonna make them eat our shit-
then shit out our shit...

19:26.410 --> 19:29.496
and eat their shit that's made up
of our shit that we make them eat.

19:29.538 --> 19:32.624
And then all you mother fucks are next.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.627
Love, Jay & Silent Bob.

19:36.253 --> 19:37.587
That'll show those fucks.

19:37.671 --> 19:38.964
Now we can eat our Egga-Mooby Muffin

19:39.172 --> 19:41.842
then get back on the road,
go to Hollywood and stop those fucks...

19:42.009 --> 19:43.301
from making that movie.

19:43.510 --> 19:45.137
No more hairy bush nuns, no more dogs.

19:45.303 --> 19:46.972
We keep our eye on the prize.

19:47.097 --> 19:48.724
And let nothing...

19:48.849 --> 19:51.059
and I mean nothing distract us.

20:01.278 --> 20:03.613
Holy shit!

21:04.341 --> 21:05.300
Oh, my God.

21:05.467 --> 21:07.302
Do you get free refills with that?

21:07.511 --> 21:09.554
This? No, I use this for protection.

21:09.763 --> 21:13.141
So that no guys try to grab my shit
or anything.

21:14.017 --> 21:15.519
Hi, I'm Justice.

21:16.269 --> 21:17.896
And I am so fucking yours.

21:19.690 --> 21:20.649
I mean- hi, I'm Jay.

21:21.233 --> 21:23.527
And this is my hetero life-mate,
Silent Bob.

21:23.735 --> 21:24.736
It's nice to meet you.

21:24.945 --> 21:27.114
Justice, huh? That's a nice name.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.450
Jay and Justice sitting in a tree...

21:30.617 --> 21:33.370
f-u-c-k-i-n-g.

21:33.537 --> 21:35.580
So you come around here often?

21:35.789 --> 21:37.791
I'm not from around here.

21:37.874 --> 21:39.835
My friends and I are on a road trip.

21:40.002 --> 21:41.003
Friends, huh?

21:41.169 --> 21:42.045
Where are they at?

21:42.212 --> 21:45.924
Out there by that van.

22:08.572 --> 22:09.323
Hi.

22:09.573 --> 22:12.200
Dude, I think I just filled the cup.

22:14.828 --> 22:19.583
Ladies, ladies, ladies -
Jay and Silent Bob are in the house.

22:20.292 --> 22:22.294
Who the fuck are these guys?

22:22.502 --> 22:25.213
This is Jay and Silent Bob.

22:25.255 --> 22:27.883
Guys, this is Sissy, Missy and Chrissy.

22:28.091 --> 22:30.260
Where the fuck did they come from?

22:30.469 --> 22:31.094
I met them inside.

22:31.345 --> 22:32.095
They're gonna hitch a ride.

22:32.554 --> 22:34.765
I don't know if that's such a good idea

22:34.931 --> 22:36.683
Sure it is, Jugs.

22:36.767 --> 22:38.435
Oh, my God!

22:38.643 --> 22:40.145
He just called Sissy "Jugs".

22:40.354 --> 22:42.022
- I'm on it.
- Chrissy, no!

22:42.189 --> 22:43.315
We're in the middle of suburbia.

22:43.523 --> 22:44.691
Let's try and act like it.

22:44.858 --> 22:45.609
What's with the knife?

22:45.776 --> 22:46.777
We having cake or something?

22:46.985 --> 22:48.278
Shit.

22:48.445 --> 22:49.613
He's retarded to boot.

22:49.780 --> 22:51.823
She called you retarded.

22:52.032 --> 22:53.367
What is wrong with you, Justice?

22:53.617 --> 22:55.118
You do remember where
we're going, don't you?

22:55.369 --> 22:56.745
And we have a job to do.

22:56.787 --> 22:58.163
They're just gonna tag along for
a few miles.

22:58.372 --> 22:59.665
They won't get in the way, I swear.

22:59.873 --> 23:02.376
I swear I don't know what's going on
in your fucking brain lately.

23:02.626 --> 23:04.002
Please?

23:04.211 --> 23:05.796
Fine, they can ride with us.

23:05.962 --> 23:08.256
But they are so out of here
before we get to Boulder.

23:08.465 --> 23:09.299
Honest injun.

23:09.466 --> 23:11.510
- Honest injun.
- Shut up.

23:11.551 --> 23:13.512
I can't believe what a pushover you are

23:13.720 --> 23:16.306
And I can't believe fine-ass
bitches like yourself eat that shit.

23:16.473 --> 23:18.558
Don't you know fast food
makes girls fart?

23:18.725 --> 23:21.186
What's all this talk about farting?

23:21.395 --> 23:24.523
Hi, Brent.

23:24.731 --> 23:27.693
This is Brent. He's with us, too.

23:27.734 --> 23:30.570
Brent, tell these sillies that
girls don't fart.

23:30.821 --> 23:33.073
Of course they don't.

23:33.323 --> 23:35.575
Only skeevy stoners fart.

23:35.909 --> 23:37.119
What up, homies?

23:37.244 --> 23:40.539
Wow, three guys, four girls.

23:40.747 --> 23:42.624
What's the count, boys?

23:42.833 --> 23:43.959
Let's rock.

23:44.835 --> 23:47.337
Dear Mr. Science guy...

23:47.587 --> 23:50.465
don't spray that aerosol in my eye.

23:53.176 --> 23:57.305
I don't really want to die.

23:57.514 --> 23:59.641
I'm a noble rabbit.

24:00.851 --> 24:02.811
What are you guys,
a cover band or something?

24:03.103 --> 24:05.480
We're the Kansas state chapter of SAAC-

24:05.689 --> 24:07.566
Students Against Animal Cruelty.

24:07.774 --> 24:11.194
We're on our way to Colorado to give
Provasik a piece of our minds.

24:13.363 --> 24:16.366
What the fuck
are you bitches babbling about?

24:16.533 --> 24:19.036
Hey! Watch the language, little boy.

24:19.119 --> 24:21.580
There are females present.

24:21.788 --> 24:25.667
Provasik Pharmaceuticals is
a medical lab where they perform...

24:25.876 --> 24:27.502
gross experiments on animals.

24:27.711 --> 24:31.506
What kind of animals
are we talking about? Bears, Rhinos?

24:31.715 --> 24:33.091
No!

24:33.383 --> 24:37.137
More like dogs, cats, rabbits,
muskrats, beavers.

24:37.304 --> 24:39.014
Heck, even monkeys.

24:39.222 --> 24:41.475
If we don't speak up for them, who will?

24:41.558 --> 24:43.810
Right, Jussy?

24:43.977 --> 24:45.520
Right, Brent.

24:50.734 --> 24:53.403
Brent, can I talk to you over here
for a second?

25:01.495 --> 25:05.123
Be honest, you're down with this
for the fine-ass pussy, right?

25:05.332 --> 25:08.919
I'm down with this
because I love animals, stupid.

25:09.920 --> 25:10.962
Even sheep?

25:11.171 --> 25:12.047
Of course.

25:12.172 --> 25:14.383
Sheep are beautiful creatures.

25:14.591 --> 25:16.259
They are beautiful, aren't they?

25:16.343 --> 25:17.969
Oh God, yes.

25:18.679 --> 25:20.389
So that means you'd fuck a sheep, right?

25:20.514 --> 25:22.474
What is your damage, little boy?

25:22.683 --> 25:24.851
You have a sick
and twisted world perspective.

25:25.018 --> 25:28.397
You're misunderstanding me,
Prince Valiant.

25:28.605 --> 25:30.732
I mean if you were another sheep.

25:30.857 --> 25:33.652
Would you fuck a sheep
if you were another sheep?

25:35.946 --> 25:38.490
Since you put it that way...

25:38.699 --> 25:39.616
you bet your ass I would.

25:40.450 --> 25:42.536
I thought so.

25:43.453 --> 25:44.705
This mother fucker ain't one of us.

25:44.871 --> 25:46.790
He said he'd fuck a sheep.

25:49.793 --> 25:52.713
Now who's stupid,
you dirty sheep fucker?

26:04.141 --> 26:06.852
- What the fuck are we gonna do?
- Shut up, I'm thinking.

26:07.728 --> 26:09.396
Is Hollywood near where we're going?

26:09.563 --> 26:11.314
Is that where you guys are from?

26:11.481 --> 26:12.190
Yeah, right.

26:12.482 --> 26:14.317
Jersey represent.

26:14.484 --> 26:16.278
Oh, a Jersey boy.

26:16.570 --> 26:18.530
What brings you all the way out here?

26:18.739 --> 26:20.115
We couldn't hang around
the Quick-Stop no more...

26:20.157 --> 26:21.533
because of the restraining order.

26:21.742 --> 26:22.826
Which sucks ass...

26:22.993 --> 26:25.537
because it's been mine and Silent Bob's
home since we were kinds.

26:25.746 --> 26:28.123
Silent Bob even busted his cherry there

26:28.165 --> 26:30.459
You did?

26:30.667 --> 26:34.087
I bet she was a lucky girl.

26:35.922 --> 26:37.841
Fuck that fat fuck!

26:38.008 --> 26:40.218
I'm trying to tell a story.

26:40.427 --> 26:41.720
Sorry.

26:41.928 --> 26:43.805
We were talking to Brodie...

26:44.014 --> 26:45.807
and he told us about
the Bluntman & Chronic movie...

26:46.016 --> 26:48.101
so we went to see Holden McNeil
and he showed us the internet...

26:48.352 --> 26:50.479
and that's where we found all
those little fucking jerk-offs...

26:50.687 --> 26:51.521
talking shit about us.

26:51.688 --> 26:52.773
So we decided to go to Hollywood...

26:52.939 --> 26:54.566
and stop the movie from getting made.

26:54.775 --> 26:56.234
And now we're here.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.028
I have no idea what you just said.

26:58.111 --> 26:59.738
I get that a lot.

26:59.946 --> 27:01.281
So, you like animals, huh?

27:01.531 --> 27:02.532
Sure.

27:02.699 --> 27:04.159
That's cool. Even snakes?

27:04.368 --> 27:06.870
You can't exclude an animal just
because they're not cuddly.

27:07.037 --> 27:08.413
Of course I like snakes.

27:08.622 --> 27:10.540
How about trouser snakes?

27:10.957 --> 27:12.584
What's a trouser snake?

27:17.381 --> 27:19.216
What the fuck are you waiting for.

27:19.383 --> 27:21.301
She went for the set-up...

27:21.385 --> 27:23.136
reach in your pants
and pull your cock out, bitch.

27:23.387 --> 27:25.597
Girls like that kind of shit.

27:28.225 --> 27:30.268
Right here is where the angel
is supposed to show up...

27:30.477 --> 27:31.770
and tell you not to pull your dick out,

27:31.895 --> 27:34.606
but we bitch-slapped that mother fucker
and sent him packing...

27:34.815 --> 27:36.525
so it's smooth sailing.

27:36.733 --> 27:38.527
Let him rip, boy.

27:43.740 --> 27:47.995
"Jesus loves the little children".

27:48.161 --> 27:49.496
Sorry I'm late.

27:49.663 --> 27:51.832
What's the deal?

27:52.666 --> 27:54.960
Oh, shit-don't tell me you're thinking
of whipping your dick out...

27:55.168 --> 27:57.587
at this fine piece of woman, are you?

27:58.588 --> 28:02.426
Look over at Silent Bob and
see if he thinks it's a good idea...

28:02.592 --> 28:04.678
to whip your dick out.

28:06.596 --> 28:09.516
That's it. Put the dick down.

28:09.683 --> 28:10.934
You got to go from heart.

28:11.101 --> 28:15.063
No little perv bullshit is gonna work
for this one.

28:15.272 --> 28:18.400
Be smooth. Be Don Juan De La Nooch.

28:19.026 --> 28:21.987
I gotta go beat the shit out of
two sucker punching little bitches.

28:22.195 --> 28:25.324
Remember- don't pull your dick out
until she asks.

28:25.866 --> 28:27.909
Or until she's sleeping.

28:33.206 --> 28:34.082
Don't ask.

28:34.291 --> 28:35.709
So what can a smooth pimp-daddy
like me...

28:35.792 --> 28:37.210
do to help the animals?

28:37.461 --> 28:41.173
You really don't want to help us.

28:41.381 --> 28:42.090
What are you talking about?

28:42.299 --> 28:45.552
Sure I do. I'd do anything for you.

28:46.553 --> 28:48.930
I mean youse guys-
I 'd do anything for youse guys.

28:49.139 --> 28:50.640
Because of the lift and shit.

28:50.891 --> 28:55.562
Okay. Let me talk to the other girls
and get back to you.

28:55.729 --> 28:56.938
You do that.

28:57.147 --> 28:58.690
I'll be right here waiting.

29:14.581 --> 29:16.583
Fuck you, fatty.

29:36.770 --> 29:38.313
You guys want anything from inside?

29:38.522 --> 29:39.564
No, we're cool.

30:05.716 --> 30:07.300
It just isn't the same, is it?

30:08.218 --> 30:11.138
This place licks balls compared to
the Quick-Stop.

30:11.304 --> 30:13.849
Speaking of licking balls-
how about that Justice chick?

30:14.057 --> 30:15.392
She is too fine.

30:15.559 --> 30:17.936
And she smells so fucking pretty.

30:18.645 --> 30:21.732
She has a nice voice, too.
And that body!

30:21.898 --> 30:23.358
Fucking smoking.

30:23.567 --> 30:26.361
She didn't tell me to fuck off once
when I was talking to her...

30:26.570 --> 30:28.447
or pull out the pepper spray.

30:28.655 --> 30:32.451
You know,
lunch box-she could be the one.

30:34.244 --> 30:35.537
- Smooth move, Justice.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.205
- Nice going, four eyes.

30:38.165 --> 30:40.542
Why did you let that stoner throw Brent
out of the van?

30:40.751 --> 30:43.003
If I had to listen to one more of
those stupid songs...

30:43.253 --> 30:44.838
I was gonna throw him out myself.

30:44.921 --> 30:46.506
We needed Brent.

30:46.757 --> 30:48.091
He was our patsy, remember?

30:48.342 --> 30:49.634
We'll just find someone else.

30:49.843 --> 30:52.012
Besides, I didn't see you try to
stop Jay from throwing him out.

30:52.179 --> 30:54.056
I didn't want to blow our cover.

30:54.097 --> 30:55.891
Cover? You all hated his songs, too.

30:56.099 --> 30:57.184
Not as much as I hate you.

30:57.351 --> 30:59.269
We have a very simple gang.

30:59.436 --> 31:01.521
I'm the brains, Chrissy's the brawn
and Missy's the tech girl.

31:01.688 --> 31:04.650
But lately I'm can't figure out
what you're doing here.

31:04.858 --> 31:06.568
Your name doesn't even fit
the rhyme scheme.

31:06.693 --> 31:07.903
Since you let our patsy slip away...

31:08.111 --> 31:10.697
you have to convince the little kid
and the fat guy to take his place.

31:10.864 --> 31:12.824
They've gotta break into Provasik now.

31:14.868 --> 31:16.703
You'll do it or you're out of the gang.

31:16.953 --> 31:18.914
Just use the little one's crush on you
to convince him...

31:19.122 --> 31:21.541
since he's so fucking in love with you.

31:21.708 --> 31:23.251
Jay? No, he's not.

31:23.460 --> 31:24.461
Am I blind?

31:24.628 --> 31:26.088
He wasn't kissing your hand
in the van...

31:26.296 --> 31:28.131
like he was Lord Byron?

31:28.382 --> 31:30.634
Maybe he has manners?

31:32.386 --> 31:35.514
You ever had your asshole licked
by a fat man in an overcoat?

31:38.392 --> 31:39.851
We've got about two hours
before we get to Boulder.

31:39.976 --> 31:41.728
That'll give you plenty of time
to work on him.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.438
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Why the fuck not?

31:43.647 --> 31:45.607
Because he's just so innocent.

31:45.816 --> 31:46.733
Look at him.

31:49.486 --> 31:49.778
Who's it gonna be?

31:49.987 --> 31:51.405
Him or us?

31:54.658 --> 31:57.327
Steal a monkey? No problem.

31:57.494 --> 31:59.329
It's not stealing a monkey.

31:59.496 --> 32:01.915
It's liberating it. It's-

32:02.082 --> 32:03.417
Wait a second.

32:03.583 --> 32:04.876
Did you say "no problem"?

32:05.002 --> 32:07.045
Yeah, we steal monkeys all the time.

32:07.254 --> 32:09.172
Right, lunch-box?

32:10.507 --> 32:12.342
It's not like it's a bad thing.

32:12.509 --> 32:14.553
It's for a good cause.

32:14.761 --> 32:16.930
It's for the best cause, mon cheri.

32:17.014 --> 32:19.182
The cause of love.

32:20.350 --> 32:21.768
Snoogens.

32:22.019 --> 32:23.186
What the heck is that?

32:23.437 --> 32:26.023
- What?
- Snoogens, I believe.

32:26.189 --> 32:27.524
What the fuck do you think it means?

32:27.774 --> 32:29.651
It means I'm kidding.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.029
That's too bad.

32:39.119 --> 32:43.832
I can't believe I'm gonna get some
pussy for stealing a monkey.

32:46.793 --> 32:47.961
If I'd known that earlier...

32:48.128 --> 32:51.006
I'd have been stealing monkeys
since I was seven.

32:51.048 --> 32:53.884
Don't, mother fucker-
don't you ruin this for me.

32:54.051 --> 32:56.136
Me and Justice
are gonna get married some day...

32:56.219 --> 32:58.221
so don't be giving me no look like
we ain't gonna steal the monkey.

32:58.472 --> 33:00.098
I'm Morris Day, you're Jerome, bitch!

33:00.140 --> 33:01.683
Don't forget that.

33:01.892 --> 33:05.062
That girl- that girl is in love with me

33:05.312 --> 33:06.813
They're gonna do it.

33:06.980 --> 33:08.023
Good.

33:08.231 --> 33:10.192
They do their part and we'll do ours.

33:26.500 --> 33:28.752
Remember- we meet back here
when you're done.

33:29.336 --> 33:30.295
Are you sure you're okay with this?

33:30.504 --> 33:33.256
Sure as I am that you're the hottest
bitch I've ever seen.

33:33.507 --> 33:34.758
Easy...

33:34.925 --> 33:36.677
What's twisting this bitch's tit?

33:36.843 --> 33:40.138
Maybe it's because women don't
like to be called bitches, Jay.

33:40.347 --> 33:42.099
They don't?

33:42.265 --> 33:43.892
How about "fine piece of ass"?

33:44.017 --> 33:45.185
How about not.

33:45.352 --> 33:46.812
What the fuck am I supposed
to call you?

33:47.020 --> 33:48.772
Something sweet, you big goof.

33:48.939 --> 33:51.650
Something nice.

33:51.858 --> 33:53.860
Boo-boo kitty fuck?

33:54.027 --> 33:57.823
Okay, that's a start.

33:58.031 --> 33:58.907
Jay, before you go...

33:59.116 --> 34:01.618
could you say something into the camera
about the clitoris?

34:01.785 --> 34:04.079
- You are such a bitch!
- Shut up, Justice.

34:04.287 --> 34:06.915
She's a little embarrassed.

34:06.957 --> 34:09.458
We're making a documentary for
a human sexuality class...

34:09.626 --> 34:12.545
and we need a male perspective
on the clitoris.

34:12.713 --> 34:14.255
The female clitoris?

34:14.464 --> 34:15.674
Yeah.

34:15.882 --> 34:17.259
Jay, you don't have to do this.

34:17.300 --> 34:18.592
It's cool.

34:19.136 --> 34:20.887
There's a few things
I could say about the clit...

34:21.054 --> 34:23.556
that I'd like you to hear.

34:24.891 --> 34:27.268
I am the master of the clit.

34:27.476 --> 34:29.312
Remember this fucking face.

34:29.396 --> 34:31.188
Wherever you see clit,
you'll see this fucking face.

34:31.398 --> 34:32.899
I make that shit work.

34:33.065 --> 34:34.650
No one rules the clit like me.

34:34.900 --> 34:35.819
Not this little fuck.

34:36.069 --> 34:38.155
None of you little fucks out there.

34:38.322 --> 34:40.532
I am the clit commander.

34:40.741 --> 34:42.868
When it comes down
to business this is what I do.

34:43.076 --> 34:46.330
I pinch it like this-
Oh, you little fuck.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.541
And then I rub my nose-

34:49.750 --> 34:52.418
Awesome. Knock 'em dead, tiger.

34:52.585 --> 34:53.420
I will.

34:53.587 --> 34:54.545
Girls.

34:56.672 --> 34:59.760
Do you think I could get a little kiss
for good luck?

35:05.015 --> 35:08.643
Do you think I could get
a little blow job for good luck?

35:09.436 --> 35:11.605
No. Go.

35:17.110 --> 35:18.820
Get off my Kool-Aid, mother fucker.

35:32.959 --> 35:34.670
Jussy, come on.

36:10.664 --> 36:13.000
- Are they in?
- You could say that.

36:13.834 --> 36:15.210
Time to shine. Let's go.

37:12.559 --> 37:13.810
You are so gay.

37:21.068 --> 37:23.445
Once we get upstairs
I want complete silence.

37:23.987 --> 37:25.864
Missy whipped this up-
it counts our decibel level.

37:26.073 --> 37:27.824
If it goes into the red- alarm,
we're dead.

37:28.492 --> 37:30.202
So that means not even
the slightest noise, you got that?

37:30.369 --> 37:31.495
Got it.

37:41.505 --> 37:42.547
Justice, move your ass.

38:07.114 --> 38:08.532
Check this shit out, lunch-box.

38:08.782 --> 38:09.783
Animal tranquilizers.

38:09.950 --> 38:12.744
This shit fucks you up- like percosets.

38:16.623 --> 38:19.960
Keep this, so later me and Justice
can shoot each other with it...

38:20.168 --> 38:22.504
and fuck like stoned test-bunnies.

38:45.485 --> 38:46.987
Suzanne.

38:48.572 --> 38:50.699
Boo-yah.

40:51.695 --> 40:54.239
Holy fuck! The little stoner was right!

41:06.793 --> 41:08.378
Boom-box.

41:09.212 --> 41:10.047
I can't believe it.

41:10.297 --> 41:10.756
Months of planning...

41:10.922 --> 41:12.382
and it's all blown by a fart.

41:12.549 --> 41:13.508
We can't just leave them here.

41:13.717 --> 41:15.427
That alarm will bring the cops
any minute.

41:15.594 --> 41:17.179
That's always been the plan.

41:17.220 --> 41:18.764
They take the heat off us long enough
'til we can get out of town.

41:24.811 --> 41:27.564
Ka-boom! You little stoner fucks.

41:27.731 --> 41:29.524
Let's go!

41:43.497 --> 41:44.790
What are you looking at?

41:44.831 --> 41:46.083
There ain't no snacks here.

41:46.625 --> 41:47.292
We got what we came for.

41:47.501 --> 41:49.044
Let's get outta here.

41:52.839 --> 41:53.632
I know it's sad.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.884
But what are we supposed
to do about it?

42:06.603 --> 42:08.230
Justice, open the door!

42:10.440 --> 42:11.566
Oh, shit!

42:20.117 --> 42:21.743
Drop the bag-now!!!

42:53.567 --> 42:55.610
Justice!

43:23.764 --> 43:25.682
You mind if I lean that there?

43:29.311 --> 43:30.646
My, oh my, oh my.

43:32.522 --> 43:34.691
Who let the cats out?

43:34.816 --> 43:36.943
Wait-is that-??

43:37.152 --> 43:38.904
Excuse me, who the hell are you?

43:39.780 --> 43:40.947
Federal Wildlife Marshall.

43:41.114 --> 43:43.241
This investigation is now
under my jurisdiction.

43:43.450 --> 43:44.117
Really? Why is that?

43:44.284 --> 43:47.162
Because someone let a whole mess of
animals out of their cages, sir.

43:47.329 --> 43:48.997
We believe that was just
a diversionary tactic used...

43:49.206 --> 43:52.042
to call attention away from
the real heist at the Diamond Exchange.

43:52.209 --> 43:54.586
Yeah, right.
That's a believable scenario.

43:54.628 --> 43:57.047
Sounds more like something out of
a bad movie.

44:00.133 --> 44:03.470
The Provasik people say
they've rounded up all their animals...

44:03.637 --> 44:06.640
except for one-an orangutan.

44:07.557 --> 44:09.643
The most dangerous animal known to man.

44:10.727 --> 44:12.229
Sir,
this was just delivered to the station.

44:12.354 --> 44:13.814
What is it?

44:14.690 --> 44:16.900
It's a tape from the terrorists who
claim responsibility for the break-in.

44:17.025 --> 44:18.944
Do you have a VCR?

44:18.986 --> 44:20.737
I am the clit commander.

44:20.946 --> 44:22.406
Oh, my God!

44:24.074 --> 44:25.575
Blafsky, it's Willenholly.

44:25.742 --> 44:28.662
I need you to get me on
the national news, pronto.

44:28.829 --> 44:30.539
Why?

44:30.747 --> 44:32.416
Because we may be dealing with...

44:32.582 --> 44:34.710
the two most dangerous men on
the planet.

44:43.427 --> 44:44.970
This is Jussy's monkey.

44:48.432 --> 44:50.517
Justice died for you,
you little monkey fuck!

44:53.437 --> 44:54.730
Do something, tons of fun.

44:58.483 --> 45:00.777
Is that thing waving at us?

45:03.613 --> 45:05.073
It understood us.

45:05.949 --> 45:07.117
Maybe it's some kind of supermonkey?

45:13.957 --> 45:15.334
You're my bitch!

45:15.459 --> 45:16.460
You get my back.

45:16.626 --> 45:18.920
Don't go taking
this fucking chimp's side.

45:33.477 --> 45:35.896
What if there are more
super monkeys up at that lab?

45:36.146 --> 45:38.315
Maybe they're making an army of
them up there?

45:38.732 --> 45:40.275
Holy shit!

45:40.484 --> 45:42.736
Maybe it's a conspiracy,
like in the "X-Files"...

45:43.403 --> 45:44.696
Roswell style?

45:47.658 --> 45:50.410
This little monkey can be
the fucking damn dirty apes

45:50.661 --> 45:53.830
responsible for fall of
the human race

45:55.248 --> 45:58.251
and this world got mad
we won't spank the monkey

45:58.418 --> 46:00.712
The monkey will spank us.

46:01.672 --> 46:05.550
I'm not even supposed to be here today.

46:05.759 --> 46:08.053
Eaten alive.

46:08.178 --> 46:10.472
Then these monkey fucks
will start wearing our clothes...

46:10.597 --> 46:13.350
and rebuilding the world in their image

46:14.851 --> 46:16.103
And only those...

46:16.353 --> 46:21.692
as super smart as me will be left alive
to bitterly cry...

46:22.025 --> 46:23.110
You maniacs!

46:23.276 --> 46:24.611
Damn youse!

46:24.778 --> 46:29.199
God damn youse all to hell!

46:31.118 --> 46:33.161
Not on my watch, mother fucker.

46:33.370 --> 46:35.664
Die, you super-monkey fuck!

46:44.548 --> 46:47.175
Alright, you can live. For now.

46:49.636 --> 46:51.763
You see that shit. Bitches love me.

46:52.472 --> 46:53.348
Let's get something to eat.

46:56.143 --> 46:57.561
We ain't hiding in the woods no more.

46:57.644 --> 46:58.979
We gotta get to Hollywood.

46:59.646 --> 47:01.398
Besides, we're in the clear.

47:01.481 --> 47:03.191
It's not like anyone knows
we stole the monkey.

47:06.486 --> 47:08.989
I'm Reg Hartner with an exclusive
News Now bulletin.

47:09.156 --> 47:13.535
A Provasik animal testing facility
in Boulder was the focus of an attack

47:13.744 --> 47:16.455
by a terroristic primate rescue
syndicate calling themselves...

47:16.663 --> 47:20.375
The Coalition for Liberation of
Itinerant Tree Dwellers...

47:20.584 --> 47:22.878
or simply C.L.I.T.

47:23.086 --> 47:25.255
In a videotape sent to
authorities this morning...

47:25.505 --> 47:27.674
credit for the liberation of
an orangutan from the lab last night...

47:27.841 --> 47:31.928
is taken by these men, identified
in literature that accompanied the tape

47:32.095 --> 47:35.349
as Jay and Silent Bob.

47:35.515 --> 47:37.559
In this chilling clip, they make it
very clear that they...

47:37.768 --> 47:40.729
are in control... of the C.L.I.T.

47:41.355 --> 47:42.773
We are the C.L.I.T.
None of you are safe.

47:42.939 --> 47:45.233
Now tremble before
my remorseless leader.

47:45.442 --> 47:47.778
I am the clit commander.

47:47.944 --> 47:48.945
Terrifying.

47:49.780 --> 47:50.614
Here to help us explain this footage...

47:50.781 --> 47:53.200
is Federal Wildlife
Marshall Willenholly.

47:53.450 --> 47:54.868
Marshall, thanks for joining us.

47:55.035 --> 47:57.996
At this point, what can you tell us
about the C.L.I.T?

47:58.038 --> 48:00.999
From the intelligence we've been
gathering, we've discovered...

48:01.124 --> 48:04.920
that the C.L.I.T. is actually
a tiny offshoot of the L.A.B.I.A.

48:05.128 --> 48:06.755
The Liberate Apes Before
Imprisoning Apes movement.

48:06.797 --> 48:08.423
Exactly.

48:08.548 --> 48:10.175
The two men that you saw in the video

48:10.384 --> 48:14.221
go by the obvious code names
of Jay and Silent Bob.

48:14.304 --> 48:18.058
If anyone out there should come
across them or any other Clitties...

48:18.225 --> 48:20.602
please exercise extreme caution.

48:20.811 --> 48:23.021
I told you that restraining order
was a good idea.

48:23.063 --> 48:25.232
What response do you hope to elicit...

48:25.399 --> 48:27.859
by putting this kind
of pressure on the C.L.I.T?

48:28.151 --> 48:29.277
It's a difficult situation.

48:29.486 --> 48:30.737
You don't want to rub the C.L.I.T.
The wrong way.

48:30.904 --> 48:34.658
Nights like this,
I miss dating a lesbian.

48:35.575 --> 48:36.743
Is that your cell phone, sir?

48:36.910 --> 48:40.580
Blavsky, give me a frigging break.

48:40.747 --> 48:41.498
I'm on my way.

48:41.748 --> 48:42.916
We've got them. They're in Utah.

48:43.083 --> 48:47.713
Citizens of Utah, stimulation of
the C.L.I.T. is not recommended.

48:48.505 --> 48:49.548
Your plan worked.

48:49.756 --> 48:52.926
The news is all about Jay
and your C.L.I.T.

48:53.176 --> 48:54.720
With almost no mention of
the diamond heist.

48:54.761 --> 48:56.346
I told you those two
were the perfect patsies.

48:56.513 --> 48:57.556
Don't you have any regret?

48:57.764 --> 48:59.266
Jay and Bob don't deserve this.

48:59.516 --> 49:01.518
They were really sweet.

49:01.601 --> 49:03.520
The only thing I regret is not gutting
that trout-mouthed prick...

49:03.687 --> 49:06.440
like a fish and playing twister
with his vitals.

49:07.607 --> 49:08.567
I don't get you, Justice.

49:08.859 --> 49:10.986
You used to be all about
this girl stuff.

49:11.028 --> 49:13.071
Stealing, boning, blowing shit up.

49:13.280 --> 49:15.115
Now you're this little priss
with a conscience.

49:15.282 --> 49:16.658
It's really a fuckin' drag.

49:16.700 --> 49:18.118
We all have to grow up sometime.

49:18.285 --> 49:20.996
If moping around over some boy
you're crushing on is growing up...

49:21.204 --> 49:23.874
then pass me my Wonder-Woman Underoos.

49:24.624 --> 49:26.084
Marvelous Pizza coming through.

49:26.293 --> 49:28.211
You the gals who ordered the pizza?

49:28.378 --> 49:29.880
This dopey bitch ordered a large plain,

49:30.047 --> 49:33.800
but I could go for some hot,
thick Sicilian.

49:34.968 --> 49:36.345
No charge, lady.

49:36.553 --> 49:37.554
Hurry.

49:44.311 --> 49:45.604
I'm sorry, Jay.

49:49.566 --> 49:51.652
Justice died trying to save this monkey

49:51.818 --> 49:53.278
so maybe we should keep it around.

49:53.487 --> 49:54.404
They way...

49:54.655 --> 49:56.740
we could honor her memory.

49:59.409 --> 50:01.453
Now ain't you glad we came here to eat?

50:01.662 --> 50:04.665
And you were all scared we'd get busted
by the cops or something.

50:05.248 --> 50:06.416
You know what I say?

50:06.667 --> 50:07.584
Fuck the Police.

50:07.834 --> 50:10.420
Fuck-Fuck-Fuck the Police!

50:10.671 --> 50:12.673
Yo, fuck-fuck the Police!

50:12.756 --> 50:14.216
Yo, fuck-fuck the Police!

50:14.341 --> 50:15.759
Yo, fuck me!

50:15.926 --> 50:18.303
This is the Utah State Police.

50:19.012 --> 50:21.098
Boys, we know you're in there.

50:21.264 --> 50:23.642
Come on out with your hands in the air

50:23.850 --> 50:26.728
and surrender the orangutan.

50:26.937 --> 50:28.897
Think they're talking about us?

50:35.362 --> 50:37.531
Sorry. Don't shoot. Hold your fire.

50:38.281 --> 50:39.282
Who the hell are you?

50:39.533 --> 50:41.118
Federal Wildlife Marshall.

50:41.368 --> 50:42.369
Is the monkey in there?

50:42.619 --> 50:43.078
The ape.

50:43.286 --> 50:43.787
What?

50:43.954 --> 50:45.539
Orangutan is a member of
the great ape family.

50:45.789 --> 50:46.456
It's not a monkey.

50:46.623 --> 50:48.542
Who's the Federal Wildlife
Marshall here?

50:48.709 --> 50:49.876
Me or you?

50:50.043 --> 50:51.086
That's what thought.

50:51.128 --> 50:52.129
Can I use your-

50:55.298 --> 50:59.344
Jay and Silent Bob-
Your C.L.I.T. doesn't stand a chance.

50:59.386 --> 51:03.432
Anyone not harboring a fugitive monkey
in there should hit the deck.

51:03.640 --> 51:04.766
We are going to open fire.

51:07.394 --> 51:08.395
What are you waiting for?

51:08.562 --> 51:10.147
Get out there and give them the monkey.

51:12.649 --> 51:14.359
Maybe it ain't so bad at that lab?

51:14.401 --> 51:16.111
Maybe they experiment on them...

51:16.320 --> 51:18.238
by making them fuck a bunch of
different good-looking monkeys?

51:18.488 --> 51:19.614
We don't know.

51:20.407 --> 51:21.575
You stay out of this,
you weepy little chimp.

51:21.742 --> 51:25.203
Fuck, you're the guy
who makes the blueprints.

51:25.412 --> 51:27.789
I don't have the fucking smarts of
a little...

51:31.585 --> 51:33.170
kid.

51:33.337 --> 51:34.588
Do not shoot!

51:37.758 --> 51:41.011
We're just trying to take our son
out of this hostile environment.

51:41.178 --> 51:42.512
Their son?

51:42.679 --> 51:44.181
Maybe they're one of those gay couples?

51:44.348 --> 51:46.224
Yeah, we're gay.

51:46.433 --> 51:48.060
And this is our adopted love child.

51:48.352 --> 51:49.686
We're not from around here.

51:50.270 --> 51:52.272
Don't makes us go back to
our liberal city home...

51:52.522 --> 51:56.026
with tales of prejudice
and bigotry from the heart of Utah.

51:56.193 --> 51:58.737
This is the last thing I need.

51:58.779 --> 52:01.198
Uppity homosexuals shooting
their mouths off to the...

52:01.365 --> 52:05.202
liberal media that the Federal Wildlife
Office persecutes gays.

52:05.369 --> 52:07.454
Are you fucking crazy?
They may be gay...

52:07.537 --> 52:09.581
but that's not their son-
that's the ape!

52:09.790 --> 52:12.167
I think I would recognize an ape
if I saw one.

52:12.376 --> 52:14.503
And the only thing
I do recognize right now...

52:14.711 --> 52:17.923
is a political fiasco that
I'm about to avoid...

52:18.131 --> 52:20.509
by letting
this butt-fucking Brady bunch go.

52:25.472 --> 52:27.641
You are free to leave, sirs.

52:29.142 --> 52:30.519
Yes, you, sirs.

52:30.560 --> 52:31.937
So we can just go?

52:32.145 --> 52:32.771
Yes, sir.

52:32.980 --> 52:35.482
Please accept my apology for
detaining you and your...

52:35.649 --> 52:39.194
unorthodox but constitutionally
protected family unit.

52:39.987 --> 52:41.697
Un-fucking-believable.

52:41.905 --> 52:45.742
I might add, that is one fine
looking young boy you're raising.

52:45.909 --> 52:47.536
That's because he's from my sperm.

52:48.245 --> 52:50.080
K knocked up this hot,
woman friend of ours...

52:50.247 --> 52:52.708
who fuck on the side so as not to be
all-the-way gay.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.086
But my tubby husband-
He's one hundred percent queer.

52:56.253 --> 52:57.629
He loves the cock.

52:58.672 --> 53:00.590
He certainly looks insatiable.

53:01.591 --> 53:02.884
Bye-bye.

53:09.433 --> 53:11.852
It's not my way, but I'll be damned
if that isn't one happy family.

53:14.271 --> 53:16.732
Alright, gang-let's just shoot
some tear gas into the diner...

53:16.940 --> 53:19.443
and when the guys come out
with the monkey-

53:19.609 --> 53:20.986
Fuck beans!

53:21.111 --> 53:22.362
That was them, wasn't it?

53:22.529 --> 53:24.489
I said you love the cock.

53:25.115 --> 53:27.701
I have to be the craftiest
mother fucker alive.

53:31.204 --> 53:32.414
Flee, fat-ass, flee!

53:41.548 --> 53:43.383
Head for the sewer!

53:58.899 --> 54:00.025
You fat fuck!

54:00.984 --> 54:03.278
Fire a warning shot
into his bulbous ass.

54:05.072 --> 54:07.366
Suck it in. Think thin!

54:08.241 --> 54:09.618
One rectal breach coming up.

54:10.327 --> 54:11.953
Suck it in!

54:11.995 --> 54:13.622
Incoming!

54:23.256 --> 54:24.549
Just like Winnie the Pooh.

54:29.012 --> 54:32.766
That was an incredibly daring escape.

54:33.767 --> 54:35.102
Here's the deal.

54:35.268 --> 54:36.603
You and your men stay up here.

54:36.853 --> 54:39.523
When I corner him, I'll call for backup.

54:40.691 --> 54:42.734
I'm counting on you, Sheriff.

54:44.528 --> 54:45.654
You've taught me so much.

54:57.374 --> 54:59.501
Fuck this asshole.

54:59.710 --> 55:02.379
Let's go back to the station and
cornhole us a drunk.

55:07.968 --> 55:10.804
The whole fucking
world's against us dude...
I swear to God.

55:12.806 --> 55:14.891
Put the monkey down and your hands up!

55:17.644 --> 55:20.897
Let's go, misters.
You want to get shot?

55:21.148 --> 55:22.774
I didn't think so.

55:22.983 --> 55:25.777
She doesn't want to go back to the lab.

55:25.986 --> 55:28.488
And for the record...
I ain't gay.

55:28.655 --> 55:30.991
And for the record,
while we're on the subject...

55:31.158 --> 55:33.660
I knew that wasn't a real little boy.

55:34.494 --> 55:37.247
For one more record- he loves the cock.

55:38.081 --> 55:40.042
On your knees, Texas Pete.

55:40.250 --> 55:41.001
Let's go.

55:41.501 --> 55:43.754
You see- he's lining us up like
fucking circus seals.

55:44.671 --> 55:45.505
I'm going first.

55:45.672 --> 55:47.799
I don't want a mouth full of
monkey spit...

55:48.008 --> 55:49.301
if I gotta blow this G-man.

55:49.426 --> 55:50.552
What are you talking about?

55:50.761 --> 55:52.929
No one's gonna get blown here-

55:55.265 --> 55:57.768
Shit!

55:59.603 --> 56:02.439
These guys are good. Very good.

56:09.946 --> 56:11.740
Hey, law-dog.

56:14.368 --> 56:16.620
See you in Hell, cock-smoker.

56:17.704 --> 56:20.499
Oh, Fuck me.

56:45.232 --> 56:47.734
Get the fuck off her-
that's my ex-girlfriend's monkey.

56:50.988 --> 56:53.949
Hey, that monkey don't belong to you.

57:01.498 --> 57:03.291
Who the fuck just steals a monkey?

57:06.003 --> 57:07.004
Oh, yeah.

57:07.170 --> 57:08.130
This blows.

57:08.338 --> 57:11.091
We have one more day to stop
these fucks from shooting this movie.

57:11.258 --> 57:14.720
They took the one thing I had left
from the one woman I loved enough...

57:14.845 --> 57:17.097
not to stick my hand down her pants.

57:19.516 --> 57:20.475
Go after the monkey?

57:20.684 --> 57:22.144
How do we know where that car is going?

57:25.605 --> 57:27.733
Don't just point.

57:30.110 --> 57:31.028
What, you gotta take a shit?

57:32.612 --> 57:33.739
No, you gotta take a salad.

57:35.365 --> 57:36.658
What the fuck are you trying to say?

57:37.034 --> 57:37.951
Say it!

57:38.035 --> 57:38.869
Don't make me ask twenty questions.

57:39.036 --> 57:42.039
You could always tell that
stupid Amy story all the time...

57:42.122 --> 57:45.042
but you can't spit out
"Jay, I disagree," or...

57:45.208 --> 57:47.294
"those are some good cheese fries".

57:49.463 --> 57:51.131
Just fucking say it!

57:52.883 --> 57:55.552
The sign on the back of the car...

57:55.719 --> 57:58.347
said "Critters of Hollywood"...

57:58.889 --> 58:00.432
you dumb fuck!

58:06.229 --> 58:07.481
Say it, don't spray it.

58:10.400 --> 58:14.112
And might I add, that is
one fine-looking boy you are raising.

58:20.994 --> 58:23.497
If it isn't the wildlife expert.

58:24.164 --> 58:25.957
Your office faxed this over.

58:26.667 --> 58:28.919
The guy said it was a post from
an internet chat board...

58:29.002 --> 58:31.254
signed by a Jay & Silent Bob.

58:34.257 --> 58:36.635
"All you mother fuckers are gonna pay."

58:36.843 --> 58:39.471
"You are the ones who are ball lickers"

58:39.680 --> 58:41.390
"We're gonna fuck your mothers
while you watch and cry..."

58:41.598 --> 58:45.978
"like little bitches.
Once we get to Hollywood, we're-"

58:46.603 --> 58:47.980
They're going to Hollywood.

59:12.045 --> 59:12.963
It's not like cheating.

59:13.130 --> 59:14.673
Justice blew up.

59:15.716 --> 59:16.758
Here's the plan.

59:16.883 --> 59:19.094
First we find out
where they're shooting this movie.

59:19.302 --> 59:22.764
And after we bust that shit up,
we can start looking for the monkey.

59:22.973 --> 59:24.141
But before we do any of that,

59:24.308 --> 59:26.226
we gotta find a mother fucker
in the know.

59:26.393 --> 59:27.686
Someone like the Mayor of Hollywood.

59:27.894 --> 59:29.229
Crack. Want some crack.

59:30.397 --> 59:31.440
Get you high.

59:31.648 --> 59:33.358
No, but do you want some weed?

59:34.318 --> 59:35.777
Are you on the job?

59:35.986 --> 59:38.655
Yeah. Jersey local 404.

59:40.490 --> 59:43.035
Pumpkin Escobar, Los Angeles local 305.

59:43.076 --> 59:45.620
- What up?

59:46.663 --> 59:48.206
- Man, it's a small world.

59:48.415 --> 59:49.541
Let me ask you a question.

59:49.750 --> 59:51.877
You dudes getting medical out
there in Jersey?

59:52.085 --> 59:54.629
No.
We might have to strike in September.

59:54.838 --> 59:57.716
Norma Rae like a mother fucker.

59:57.924 --> 59:58.759
Maybe you can help us out?

59:58.925 --> 01:00:00.761
You know where they're shooting
a movie around here?

01:00:00.927 --> 01:00:02.804
You ask me a question like that
in Holly-weird?

01:00:03.013 --> 01:00:05.807
You got to come a little
more specific than that.

01:00:06.016 --> 01:00:06.850
It's a Miramax flick.

01:00:07.017 --> 01:00:08.018
We gotta bust it up...

01:00:08.268 --> 01:00:09.978
so people stop calling us names
on the internet...

01:00:10.187 --> 01:00:11.563
even though they're not really
talking about us...

01:00:11.772 --> 01:00:14.524
but characters based on us,
and at the same time...

01:00:14.691 --> 01:00:17.944
find my ex-girlfriend's, who was killed
in a car explosion, monkey.

01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:22.491
Man, I don't know what the fuck
you just said, little kid...

01:00:22.699 --> 01:00:24.743
but you're special.

01:00:24.951 --> 01:00:26.119
You reached out...

01:00:26.286 --> 01:00:28.747
and you touched a brother's gear.

01:00:29.456 --> 01:00:30.666
I'm gonna give you some directions.

01:00:30.874 --> 01:00:31.750
Give me the map, Scott.

01:00:32.376 --> 01:00:33.502
Give me the map, Scott!

01:00:34.127 --> 01:00:35.212
You know where Miramax is?

01:00:35.962 --> 01:00:40.050
Miramax accounts for 78%
of my business out here.

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:45.597
Is Hollywood ready for
Jay and Silent Bob?

01:00:45.722 --> 01:00:48.517
A source at a Federal Wildlife
Marshall's office tells us...

01:00:48.642 --> 01:00:51.645
that a posting was pulled off
an internet movie chat board...

01:00:51.812 --> 01:00:55.315
allegedly written by
the two domestic terrorists themselves.

01:00:55.482 --> 01:00:57.901
It's sending a shock-wave
through Hollywood.

01:00:57.985 --> 01:01:00.237
Jules Asner is on the scene at
Miramax Studios. Jules-

01:01:00.404 --> 01:01:04.116
Steve, the tenor of Tinsletown is
one of terror today...

01:01:04.241 --> 01:01:06.910
after the Federal Wildlife Marshall's
Office has learned that...

01:01:07.077 --> 01:01:10.622
hot new terrorists Jay and Silent Bob
have targeted Miramax studios...

01:01:10.831 --> 01:01:14.626
for their next campaign of blood,
violence and monkey theft.

01:01:14.835 --> 01:01:17.838
In a posting pulled off of Movie
Poop-Shoot. Com...

01:01:18.755 --> 01:01:20.549
the gruesome two-some threatened,
and I quote...

01:01:20.757 --> 01:01:24.803
"Once we get to Hollywood and find
those Miramax expletive deleted..."

01:01:25.012 --> 01:01:27.014
"who are making the Bluntman &
Chronic movie..."

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:29.766
"we're gonna make them eat
our expletive deleted..."

01:01:32.602 --> 01:01:35.647
"then eat their expletive deleted
which is made up of..."

01:01:35.856 --> 01:01:39.401
"our expletive deleted that
we made them eat." Unquote.

01:01:39.609 --> 01:01:41.611
So far we've been unable to
get a statement...

01:01:41.778 --> 01:01:43.280
from anyone here at the Studio.

01:01:43.447 --> 01:01:46.241
But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob?

01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:47.492
None whatsoever.

01:01:47.701 --> 01:01:49.953
But to be fair, no one is a
hundred percent sure...

01:01:50.037 --> 01:01:52.164
what Jay and Silent Bob
exactly look like...

01:01:52.289 --> 01:01:54.583
so for all we know they could
already be on the lot.

01:02:16.647 --> 01:02:19.524
OK, he's got a pass.
Let him in.

01:02:21.068 --> 01:02:24.029
We gotta play this just right.

01:02:34.748 --> 01:02:36.667
You don't have a pass!

01:02:57.771 --> 01:02:59.564
I hate how fake Hollywood is.

01:03:00.273 --> 01:03:02.526
Where do you think you're going?

01:03:06.279 --> 01:03:09.533
Echo base, I've got a 1007-
Two unauthorized on the lot.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:10.951
Requesting back-up.

01:03:11.118 --> 01:03:12.619
I thought that was a 1082.

01:03:12.786 --> 01:03:14.871
No, sir,
a 1082 is disappearing a dead hooker...

01:03:15.038 --> 01:03:16.623
from Ben Affleck's trailer.

01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:17.749
Oh, that Affleck.

01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:19.126
Back-up on the way.

01:03:19.209 --> 01:03:20.377
I'll make you a deal.

01:03:20.544 --> 01:03:23.046
This guy will suck your
dick off if you let us go.

01:03:23.213 --> 01:03:24.548
Contrary to what you believe...

01:03:24.715 --> 01:03:27.592
not everyone in the industry
is a homosexual.

01:03:27.801 --> 01:03:30.220
How about this deal?

01:03:30.304 --> 01:03:32.639
He'll suck my dick while you
watch and jerk-off?

01:03:34.725 --> 01:03:35.517
Alright.

01:03:37.561 --> 01:03:39.730
Make it fast-and sexy.

01:03:40.647 --> 01:03:41.648
It's either this or jail.

01:03:42.316 --> 01:03:43.900
And you know
what they do to you in jail.

01:03:44.735 --> 01:03:45.694
I was a guard.

01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:53.660
And after it's all over you say,
"Ooh, what a lovely tea party."

01:04:04.921 --> 01:04:06.423
What the fuck you waiting for, bitch?

01:04:06.673 --> 01:04:08.008
Start sucking.

01:04:19.603 --> 01:04:20.354
Worth a shot.

01:04:21.605 --> 01:04:23.523
Like a shot in the fucking mouth,
you gay bitch.

01:04:24.691 --> 01:04:26.985
Dude,
you were gonna really suck my dick.

01:04:32.616 --> 01:04:33.992
Remember what I said.

01:04:34.201 --> 01:04:39.081
Do not look at Ben or Matt directly
in the eyes or you will be fired.

01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:41.124
Does everybody understand that?

01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:42.584
Thank you.

01:04:45.962 --> 01:04:47.839
You frosted your hair.

01:04:49.466 --> 01:04:51.635
Yeah, I frosted my hair,
but it looks good.

01:04:52.552 --> 01:04:55.138
This has got to be the Bluntman flick.

01:04:55.222 --> 01:04:57.391
There are those two fucks
from the Mork movie.

01:04:57.474 --> 01:04:59.559
Lips-Teeth time or Lion Face?

01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:04.564
Lion face! Lemon face!

01:05:04.731 --> 01:05:05.774
Break it down.

01:05:05.983 --> 01:05:07.693
Where we taking it from, Gus?

01:05:10.737 --> 01:05:11.697
I'm busy.

01:05:11.905 --> 01:05:13.281
You're a true artist, Gus.

01:05:13.407 --> 01:05:14.491
Let's just take it from
"it's a good course".

01:05:14.574 --> 01:05:15.575
You're the director now?

01:05:15.742 --> 01:05:16.618
Shove it, "Bounce"-boy.

01:05:16.827 --> 01:05:17.577
Let's remember who talked who...

01:05:17.744 --> 01:05:19.538
into doing this shit in the first place

01:05:19.663 --> 01:05:21.206
Talking me into "Dogma" is one thing,
but-.

01:05:21.415 --> 01:05:25.127
I'm sorry I dragged you away from
whatever gay serial killers...

01:05:25.335 --> 01:05:27.295
who ride horses and like to play golf

01:05:27.504 --> 01:05:29.172
touchy-feely picture
you're gonna do this week.

01:05:29.339 --> 01:05:31.341
I take it you haven't seen
"Forces Of Nature".

01:05:31.508 --> 01:05:32.175
You're like a child.

01:05:32.342 --> 01:05:33.218
What do I keep telling you?

01:05:33.427 --> 01:05:35.929
You gotta do the safe picture-
then you do the art picture.

01:05:36.096 --> 01:05:37.723
And then sometimes you have to
do the payback picture...

01:05:37.931 --> 01:05:39.891
because your friend says you owe him.

01:05:42.019 --> 01:05:43.687
Then sometimes you have to
go back to the well.

01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:45.355
And then sometimes you do
"Reindeer Games."

01:05:45.605 --> 01:05:46.523
That's just mean.

01:05:46.773 --> 01:05:50.652
All we gotta do is figure out
how to get closer to them.

01:05:52.529 --> 01:05:54.573
Get over here.

01:05:54.698 --> 01:05:56.700
You stand here,
your buddy's right here.

01:05:56.867 --> 01:05:58.368
Just stand here and react.

01:05:58.535 --> 01:06:00.996
Don't say anything. Especially you.

01:06:02.539 --> 01:06:04.499
That's pretty funny.

01:06:04.624 --> 01:06:06.835
Lock it up, people,
we're going for picture.

01:06:07.627 --> 01:06:08.837
Make it happen, guys.

01:06:09.046 --> 01:06:10.213
- Get you fucking hands off me.

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.548
- Fuck off!

01:06:12.632 --> 01:06:14.593
On the count of three,
we rush these fucks and...

01:06:14.635 --> 01:06:16.178
beat the shit out of them,
because if they're all fucked up...

01:06:16.219 --> 01:06:17.721
they can't make that movie.

01:06:19.139 --> 01:06:23.352
Ready? One... two... three!

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:27.022
"Good Will Hunting Il: Hunting Season."
Scene 16 Take 5.

01:06:30.817 --> 01:06:32.736
Think about the paycheck.
OK.

01:06:39.743 --> 01:06:40.911
Action, Gus?

01:06:41.078 --> 01:06:42.537
Jesus, Ben, I said I'm busy.

01:06:46.667 --> 01:06:49.086
I do remember the class.

01:06:49.169 --> 01:06:51.546
But elementary.

01:06:51.755 --> 01:06:53.340
I remember that class.

01:06:53.507 --> 01:06:56.134
It was just between recess and lunch.

01:06:56.343 --> 01:06:58.637
Are we gonna have a problem- again?

01:06:58.762 --> 01:07:02.474
I was still just hoping you might
be able to give me a little insight...

01:07:02.683 --> 01:07:04.810
into the Southern Colonies.

01:07:05.686 --> 01:07:07.187
Wood says...

01:07:07.354 --> 01:07:08.855
What did I say?

01:07:09.106 --> 01:07:11.233
You'd be back in here
regurgitating Gordon Wood.

01:07:11.441 --> 01:07:13.360
But you forget about Vickers.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.153
No, I just read Vickers.

01:07:15.362 --> 01:07:16.738
So I'm up on "Inherited Wealth".

01:07:16.947 --> 01:07:21.076
But you're no longer the angry,
brilliant, young mind you once were...

01:07:21.284 --> 01:07:25.122
just itching to vent your frustrations.

01:07:25.288 --> 01:07:27.582
You stopped hitting the books
with a vengeance...

01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:32.963
and now I've read shit you haven't
even heard about yet.

01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:34.381
Face facts, my friend.

01:07:34.548 --> 01:07:36.717
You're just no longer that good...

01:07:36.883 --> 01:07:37.968
Will Hunting.

01:07:42.723 --> 01:07:46.935
Now how do you like them apples?

01:07:49.313 --> 01:07:51.565
I don't like the sound of them apples,
Will.

01:07:51.815 --> 01:07:53.233
What're we gonna do?

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.026
- Chuckie-

01:07:54.234 --> 01:07:55.402
- Yeah?

01:07:55.652 --> 01:07:57.487
Chuckie- it's hunting season.

01:08:02.576 --> 01:08:03.910
Apple sauce, bitch.

01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:09.958
Sorry to interrupt, but we've
got a 1007 on our hands.

01:08:10.167 --> 01:08:11.668
Oh, Jesus. Again, Ben?

01:08:11.835 --> 01:08:13.003
Bullshit!

01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:15.172
Cause I wasn't with a hooker today.

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.174
There they are!

01:08:18.008 --> 01:08:20.135
Affleck,
you were the bomb in "Phantoms".

01:09:02.636 --> 01:09:04.720
Alright, you bastard,
let's see who you really are.

01:09:09.559 --> 01:09:11.603
Fucking Miramax! Cut!

01:09:14.564 --> 01:09:15.857
Shannen, usually I say "Cut".

01:09:16.066 --> 01:09:17.442
A monkey, Wes?

01:09:17.651 --> 01:09:19.736
You guys aren't even trying anymore.

01:09:21.571 --> 01:09:23.573
The market research
says people love monkeys.

01:09:26.993 --> 01:09:28.370
We love this monkey.

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:31.915
See.

01:09:32.082 --> 01:09:33.542
Here they are.

01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:53.895
Punch it!

01:09:57.607 --> 01:09:58.734
Fuck!

01:10:05.866 --> 01:10:07.743
Those are some magical guys.

01:10:22.466 --> 01:10:25.469
Dude, I fucking knew it.

01:10:26.136 --> 01:10:28.472
You love that shit, don't you?

01:10:31.725 --> 01:10:33.560
Holy shit, that I looked like it hurt.

01:10:33.727 --> 01:10:35.646
Are you guys alright?

01:10:36.563 --> 01:10:38.148
Let's get you guys on your feet.

01:10:49.576 --> 01:10:52.412
Wait a second- aren't you the guy
that fucked the pie?

01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:55.290
You see, man - you see!

01:10:55.415 --> 01:10:58.543
It's never, "Hey, you were in
Loser, weren't you?"

01:10:58.669 --> 01:11:01.505
Or "Dude, you rocked in Boys And Girls"

01:11:01.588 --> 01:11:04.257
It always comes back to
that fucking pie. I'm haunted by it.

01:11:04.424 --> 01:11:06.134
- You put your dick in a pie.
- Enough!

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:08.303
I'm Jason Biggs.

01:11:08.512 --> 01:11:11.765
Did you really get to 3rd base with
that Russian chick like in the movie?

01:11:12.015 --> 01:11:14.434
You mean Shannon?

01:11:14.685 --> 01:11:15.435
No.

01:11:15.686 --> 01:11:16.979
She is fucking fine.

01:11:17.187 --> 01:11:19.272
If I was you, I would've been like-

01:11:24.611 --> 01:11:26.697
You like that?

01:11:26.905 --> 01:11:29.199
What, you never did one of these?

01:11:34.788 --> 01:11:36.748
I've done plenty of that, my friend.

01:11:36.957 --> 01:11:39.209
Holy shit, you're the Dawson.

01:11:39.418 --> 01:11:41.044
James- James Van Der Beek.

01:11:41.294 --> 01:11:43.380
What's up with Pacey stealing
Joey away from you?

01:11:43.547 --> 01:11:45.632
If I was you, I would have
drowned his ass in the creek.

01:11:45.799 --> 01:11:49.970
Yeah, for Joey. She is too fine.

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:52.180
Ever get to 3rd base with her?

01:11:52.431 --> 01:11:55.517
There was this one time- Wait a minute,
who are you guys?

01:11:56.643 --> 01:11:59.021
They're our stunt doubles, dumb ass.

01:11:59.563 --> 01:12:00.564
- Right?

01:12:00.772 --> 01:12:02.524
- Of course.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:04.860
Stunt doubles for what?

01:12:05.027 --> 01:12:07.112
For the move that we're shooting
in about fifteen minutes.

01:12:07.321 --> 01:12:09.031
Bluntman & Chronic Strike Back.

01:12:09.197 --> 01:12:11.533
You're doubling me, obviously,

01:12:11.742 --> 01:12:14.578
I'm playing Bluntman, A. KA. Silent Bill

01:12:14.745 --> 01:12:16.121
- Bob.
- Right.

01:12:16.330 --> 01:12:18.540
And he's playing Chronic.

01:12:18.749 --> 01:12:20.292
A. KA. Ray.

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:21.543
Jay. Fuck!

01:12:21.835 --> 01:12:23.378
Biggs, did you even read the script?

01:12:23.587 --> 01:12:24.254
There's a script?

01:12:24.504 --> 01:12:25.797
Hey, pie-fucker,

01:12:26.006 --> 01:12:28.925
you would only last a day on
"The Creek".

01:12:29.176 --> 01:12:31.011
Wait second, we'll be right back.

01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:32.554
Fuck you and your "Dawson's Crack".

01:12:32.763 --> 01:12:34.431
Go to hell, Pacey.

01:12:37.017 --> 01:12:38.185
These are the fucks that are playing us

01:12:38.352 --> 01:12:41.480
You take 'em out, bam! No movie.

01:12:42.773 --> 01:12:44.983
Useless little ape.

01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:48.236
What's with the weird,
gay huddle going on over there?

01:12:48.445 --> 01:12:49.613
Let me put my arm over yours.

01:12:49.821 --> 01:12:50.822
What's gay about it?

01:12:51.031 --> 01:12:52.115
It's two guys talking in a corner.

01:12:52.282 --> 01:12:55.410
Why are you such a homophobe?

01:12:55.619 --> 01:12:58.080
You're always like "That's gay,"
or "Look at that gay huddle..."

01:12:58.372 --> 01:12:59.456
"look at that gay dog."

01:12:59.665 --> 01:13:00.499
Dude, that is so gay-

01:13:00.624 --> 01:13:01.917
Yeah, see.

01:13:02.209 --> 01:13:04.795
- I love gay people.

01:13:04.961 --> 01:13:05.629
- I'm sure you do.

01:13:05.796 --> 01:13:07.839
Look at the monkey.

01:13:08.048 --> 01:13:09.841
Now you're gonna tell me
the monkey's gay.

01:13:09.967 --> 01:13:12.302
How do you know
he doesn't smoke monkey pole?

01:13:12.386 --> 01:13:14.638
He's so cute.

01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:19.685
You go in there and start swinging,
don't stop until these young...

01:13:19.893 --> 01:13:21.269
Hollywood fucks are out of commission.

01:13:21.311 --> 01:13:22.604
Ready? Break!

01:13:29.945 --> 01:13:31.822
That's one funky monkey.

01:13:34.491 --> 01:13:36.785
Mr. Biggs, Mr. Van Der Beek,
this is Security.

01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:39.121
There are two intruders on the lot.

01:13:39.329 --> 01:13:41.373
They crashed through a window
we believe might be yours.

01:13:42.749 --> 01:13:44.668
Yeah, they're in here.

01:13:45.335 --> 01:13:46.712
Do they have you held hostage?

01:13:46.753 --> 01:13:48.171
Should we call your publicist?

01:13:48.422 --> 01:13:48.964
No.

01:13:49.172 --> 01:13:51.758
We kicked those guys assess bad.

01:13:51.925 --> 01:13:53.969
Real bad.

01:13:54.177 --> 01:13:55.762
Great job, sirs.

01:13:55.929 --> 01:13:57.764
If you'll let us in,
we'll take over from here.

01:13:57.931 --> 01:14:01.226
No,
me and Jason Biggs are naked in here.

01:14:01.435 --> 01:14:03.103
Butt-naked. Together.

01:14:03.603 --> 01:14:09.484
Okay. Well, we'll wait out here
until you clean up.

01:14:19.995 --> 01:14:22.539
How are we gonna get out
without them seeing us?

01:14:28.545 --> 01:14:29.421
You've got the wrong guys.

01:14:29.629 --> 01:14:31.465
Doesn't anybody watch the WB?

01:14:31.632 --> 01:14:33.258
I'm a teen idol, dammit!

01:14:33.383 --> 01:14:34.509
Don't you recognize me?

01:14:34.718 --> 01:14:36.178
Look at me.

01:14:36.219 --> 01:14:37.638
I'm the pie-fucker!

01:14:39.556 --> 01:14:42.559
In prison, he'll be the pie.

01:14:45.228 --> 01:14:46.521
This was a good idea, lunch-box.

01:14:46.730 --> 01:14:48.106
In these outfits...

01:14:48.148 --> 01:14:49.483
we're totally incognito.

01:14:49.691 --> 01:14:51.193
Mr. Biggs, Mr. Van Der Beek-

01:14:52.569 --> 01:14:54.154
Great, you've changed costumes already.

01:14:54.321 --> 01:14:55.280
Let's get you to the set.

01:14:55.447 --> 01:14:56.823
The director doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:01.620
Look at all these crackers.

01:15:01.828 --> 01:15:04.623
70 million dollars
and I can't even get a black grip.

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:06.667
It's a shame. It's a damn shame!

01:15:06.917 --> 01:15:08.418
Here's your coffee, sir.

01:15:09.002 --> 01:15:10.754
- You spit in this?
- I didn't spit in it.

01:15:10.921 --> 01:15:12.214
Any boogers in it?

01:15:12.422 --> 01:15:13.632
There's no boogers in it, sir.

01:15:13.715 --> 01:15:14.925
You went to film school, didn't you?

01:15:15.092 --> 01:15:18.303
Must piss you off to see a black man
run a big production like this.

01:15:19.262 --> 01:15:21.014
Go to the school.

01:15:21.264 --> 01:15:24.518
Does your daddy know that
you give a nigger his coffee?

01:15:24.685 --> 01:15:26.228
It would kill him, wouldn't it?

01:15:27.104 --> 01:15:28.730
- There's no boogers in it, sir.
- Ten taste it!

01:15:29.606 --> 01:15:31.900
Taste the booger flavor.

01:15:32.109 --> 01:15:33.318
I know it's in there.

01:15:34.569 --> 01:15:35.237
It's all good, sir.

01:15:35.445 --> 01:15:36.488
No it ain't all good.

01:15:36.613 --> 01:15:37.614
Clean that shit up.

01:15:37.864 --> 01:15:39.074
Get me a white boy.

01:15:39.241 --> 01:15:42.869
Get me a blond haired,
white boy so I can enjoy that shit.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:43.537
- You're the man, sir.

01:15:43.787 --> 01:15:45.747
- No, you're the man
and that's the problem.

01:15:46.707 --> 01:15:49.084
Chaka-I'm Banky Edwards,
the creator of Bluntman & Chronic.

01:15:49.167 --> 01:15:51.545
We met a few weeks back.

01:15:51.753 --> 01:15:53.088
I'm the executive Producer.

01:15:53.296 --> 01:15:55.549
Oh, you're the Executive Producer.

01:15:55.716 --> 01:15:58.593
Why don't you executive produce me
a latte- de-crackernated.

01:15:58.802 --> 01:15:59.886
Okay, Fuck it?

01:16:00.053 --> 01:16:00.554
- It's Banky.

01:16:00.804 --> 01:16:02.180
No, its' Fuck it!

01:16:02.389 --> 01:16:04.558
I just want you to know that
I respect your work as an artist.

01:16:04.766 --> 01:16:06.226
I 'm something of an artist myself.

01:16:06.393 --> 01:16:07.978
I was the inker on the comic book.

01:16:08.228 --> 01:16:09.771
You're a tracer, okay?

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:11.440
Nobody got the heart to tell you.

01:16:11.606 --> 01:16:11.940
You trace.

01:16:12.107 --> 01:16:12.691
You go around the lines.

01:16:12.899 --> 01:16:14.443
You are a tracer!

01:16:14.484 --> 01:16:15.944
You think Fat Alber had a tracer?

01:16:16.153 --> 01:16:16.611
No.

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:18.405
Bill Cosby did the whole thing
with a roller.

01:16:18.655 --> 01:16:19.740
And it was excellent.

01:16:22.159 --> 01:16:24.578
Crack, crack, cracker?

01:16:24.828 --> 01:16:26.288
Biggs and Van Der Beek are on the set,
Chaka.

01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:27.789
I don't see them!

01:16:27.998 --> 01:16:30.083
Where are the stars of
this piece of shit?

01:16:46.683 --> 01:16:49.394
Damn, this must've set them back
a couple hundred bucks.

01:16:53.273 --> 01:16:53.690
Look at this.

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:56.777
A gay hood ornament
and the color purple.

01:16:56.943 --> 01:16:57.819
Who the fuck are you?

01:16:57.986 --> 01:16:58.612
Who the fuck am I?

01:16:58.779 --> 01:17:00.364
I'm the director, Chaka Luther King.

01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:01.490
That's who the fuck I am.

01:17:01.573 --> 01:17:02.491
Wait a second.

01:17:02.658 --> 01:17:04.201
I though Banky and Holden
created this shit.

01:17:04.242 --> 01:17:05.744
And I 'm stealing it.

01:17:05.952 --> 01:17:07.663
I'm taking it back for the black man...

01:17:07.829 --> 01:17:11.166
to make up for all the shit you
mother fuckers have taken from us.

01:17:11.375 --> 01:17:13.669
Do you know that I came up for
the idea for "Sesame Street"?

01:17:13.877 --> 01:17:15.504
I came up with it before PBS.

01:17:15.712 --> 01:17:16.797
The white man stole it.

01:17:17.047 --> 01:17:20.092
I was gonna call it
NWP- Niggers With Puppets.

01:17:20.133 --> 01:17:23.136
Catchy, ain't it?

01:17:23.303 --> 01:17:24.554
Enough of this small talk.

01:17:24.721 --> 01:17:25.597
Let's shoot.

01:17:26.473 --> 01:17:27.516
Aren't you gonna direct us?

01:17:27.683 --> 01:17:29.726
I will start directing you to the
unemployment line...

01:17:29.768 --> 01:17:31.728
if you don't stop back-talking me,
cracker.

01:17:32.437 --> 01:17:33.397
We don't know what we're doing.

01:17:33.647 --> 01:17:34.398
We didn't read the script.

01:17:34.648 --> 01:17:35.232
It ain't hard.

01:17:35.399 --> 01:17:37.192
I film the mother fucker.

01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:38.485
Then I yell "Cut!"

01:17:38.652 --> 01:17:41.029
And run the fuck out of here
and go to my trailer...

01:17:41.238 --> 01:17:45.075
cause I got more white girls there than
the first lifeboat on the Titanic.

01:17:45.242 --> 01:17:46.827
And they all want a party in my movie,

01:17:46.994 --> 01:17:48.745
and I got just the part for them.

01:17:48.912 --> 01:17:49.871
So are you ready to do this?

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.665
Let's roll with the new.

01:17:53.417 --> 01:17:55.544
Quiet on the set, everyone.

01:17:56.586 --> 01:17:58.505
I got your new coffee sir, booger-free.

01:18:01.258 --> 01:18:03.010
You guys look pretty bad-ass.

01:18:03.927 --> 01:18:06.513
"Bluntman & Chronic Strike Back",
scene 37, take 1.

01:18:12.686 --> 01:18:13.478
What're you waiting for?

01:18:13.687 --> 01:18:14.896
Action!

01:18:19.609 --> 01:18:23.113
Um... snoochy-boochies.

01:18:26.867 --> 01:18:28.744
What the fuck?

01:18:37.711 --> 01:18:41.131
You thought I'd never find
your precious Bluntcave...

01:18:41.381 --> 01:18:43.467
did you, Hemp Knight?

01:18:43.634 --> 01:18:47.971
But now, you and your sidekick...

01:18:48.013 --> 01:18:52.351
are finally
in the grasp of Cock-Knocker!

01:18:56.146 --> 01:18:58.565
Why do they call you Cock-Knocker?

01:18:58.732 --> 01:19:00.567
Actually,
there's a funny story behind that.

01:19:01.652 --> 01:19:02.069
You're gonna love it.

01:19:02.319 --> 01:19:03.445
True story.

01:19:06.239 --> 01:19:09.534
Avenge me... Hemp-Knight.

01:19:15.666 --> 01:19:18.168
I think George Lucas
is gonna sue somebody.

01:19:19.586 --> 01:19:24.257
Any last words before I bust
your balls, Bluntman?

01:20:10.721 --> 01:20:11.888
Duck, pie-fucker.

01:20:14.308 --> 01:20:15.684
Damn, these white boys can't fight.

01:20:17.811 --> 01:20:19.730
Don't fuck with a Jedi master, son.

01:20:25.319 --> 01:20:26.695
Yo! Bitch-fists!

01:20:30.407 --> 01:20:33.785
Call me Darth-balls.

01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:36.121
Good Lord.

01:20:40.667 --> 01:20:41.918
That wasn't in the script.

01:21:10.781 --> 01:21:11.740
So this is Hollywood?

01:21:12.949 --> 01:21:16.912
Then lights, camera, action,
Jay and Silent Bob.

01:21:20.248 --> 01:21:22.334
Freeze, you terrorist sons of bitches!

01:21:23.710 --> 01:21:27.214
...My God...

01:21:32.636 --> 01:21:33.887
Sorry, everyone.

01:21:34.054 --> 01:21:35.389
That was supposed to be a warning shot.

01:21:35.639 --> 01:21:37.641
I'm obviously on the wrong set.

01:21:38.642 --> 01:21:40.185
Is he gonna be okay?

01:21:42.104 --> 01:21:42.813
Not good.

01:21:49.236 --> 01:21:51.738
You are not upstaging me, Van Der Beek.

01:22:00.330 --> 01:22:02.499
This movie's gonna make "House Party"
look like "House Party 2".

01:22:02.582 --> 01:22:04.751
- Or "House Party 3".

01:22:04.918 --> 01:22:05.919
- Shut the fuck up.
- Yes, sir.

01:22:07.421 --> 01:22:10.257
Chaka, call off Dawson, will you?

01:22:15.012 --> 01:22:16.930
Can I get a "cut!" here?

01:22:22.602 --> 01:22:23.729
Not again.

01:22:25.772 --> 01:22:27.858
Now who's balls have been busted, bitch

01:22:28.775 --> 01:22:29.776
That's it! I'm out of here.

01:22:29.943 --> 01:22:31.320
Chaka, I'll be in my trailer.

01:22:33.196 --> 01:22:34.114
What the fuck?

01:22:34.281 --> 01:22:36.408
The C.L.I.T. stops here,
Jay and Silent Bob.

01:22:36.450 --> 01:22:38.535
Another white boy in this movie? Damn!

01:22:39.703 --> 01:22:41.246
Federal Wildlife Marshall.

01:22:41.288 --> 01:22:42.914
Everyone stay cool.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.833
Go back to making your adult movie.

01:22:44.875 --> 01:22:46.668
These men are the leaders of
a terrorist organization...

01:22:46.877 --> 01:22:48.879
wanted for the abduction of
a little monkey.

01:22:49.046 --> 01:22:50.672
They didn't really steal that monkey.

01:22:50.797 --> 01:22:53.925
It was just a diversion so
that we could steal these.

01:22:54.092 --> 01:22:55.385
And they're not the leaders of
the C.L.I.T.

01:22:55.636 --> 01:22:56.970
The C.L.I.T. is not real.

01:22:57.179 --> 01:22:59.181
Oh no, the C.L.I.T. is real.

01:22:59.389 --> 01:23:00.432
It's real.

01:23:00.641 --> 01:23:03.143
It's the female orgasm- that's the myth

01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:04.645
You know what I 'm talking about?

01:23:05.312 --> 01:23:06.355
Are you guys alright?

01:23:06.521 --> 01:23:08.732
I thought you blew up,
Boo-Boo Kitty-fuck.

01:23:08.899 --> 01:23:11.568
You remembered.

01:23:11.735 --> 01:23:14.071
It was a frame-up, Jay.

01:23:14.237 --> 01:23:18.533
Missy, Sissy, Chrissy and I
are international jewel thieves.

01:23:18.742 --> 01:23:19.951
We were setting you up to be a patsy...

01:23:20.118 --> 01:23:23.372
but I couldn't go through with it
because I...

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:24.539
because I love you.

01:23:25.332 --> 01:23:27.209
Yeah?
That means you're gonna fuck me, right?

01:23:27.376 --> 01:23:27.959
Of course.

01:23:28.752 --> 01:23:30.754
If she does
it'll be considered necrophilia.

01:23:30.837 --> 01:23:32.839
Because she's gonna be one dead bitch.

01:23:34.716 --> 01:23:36.760
Jussy, did we get you at a bad time?

01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:39.388
You should've just let these guys
go down.

01:23:39.596 --> 01:23:41.098
I wanted to go down,
but this angel popped on my shoulder...

01:23:41.181 --> 01:23:42.683
and said "Listen" and I was like
"What's up?"

01:23:42.849 --> 01:23:44.935
Shut the fuck up before I shoot you
where you stand...

01:23:45.143 --> 01:23:46.645
in you pansy red booties.

01:23:47.521 --> 01:23:49.189
Holy shit,
I am wearing pansy red booties.

01:23:49.356 --> 01:23:51.191
Why the fuck didn't you tell me?

01:23:51.692 --> 01:23:52.985
Let's have those diamonds, Justice.

01:23:53.193 --> 01:23:54.528
I can't do that, Sissy.

01:23:54.695 --> 01:23:57.114
Then lover-boy gets one
in the fucking brain.

01:23:58.156 --> 01:24:00.409
Yo! Lovely ladies!

01:24:00.534 --> 01:24:02.327
Would any of you like
a private audition to be in my movie.

01:24:02.369 --> 01:24:04.204
Bring that ass over. C'mon!

01:24:24.558 --> 01:24:25.600
Cray crackers with guns.

01:24:25.809 --> 01:24:27.269
Time to get my black ass outta here.

01:24:33.233 --> 01:24:34.526
You really let me down, Justice.

01:24:34.735 --> 01:24:37.321
Throwing it all away for a little
stoner with bad pronunciation.

01:24:37.571 --> 01:24:38.697
What's it gonna be, Sissy?

01:24:38.864 --> 01:24:41.241
Which fighting style do you want me
to kick your ass in?

01:24:41.408 --> 01:24:42.743
Are you kidding me?

01:24:42.993 --> 01:24:44.286
I taught you all your moves myself.

01:24:44.411 --> 01:24:46.663
There's no style you can bust
that I can't defend against.

01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:48.623
You're no match for my Shaolin Monk.

01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:50.542
But I'll bury you
with my Crouching Tiger.

01:24:50.667 --> 01:24:51.960
A little Venus Fly-trap?

01:24:52.169 --> 01:24:54.838
I'll counter with Dragon Queen.

01:24:54.838 --> 01:24:57.466
How about a little "Bitch, my man
ain't your baby's daddy"?

01:24:57.633 --> 01:24:58.634
Bring it on.

01:25:04.389 --> 01:25:06.099
I hope one of them rips off
the other one's shirt...

01:25:06.266 --> 01:25:09.394
and we see some titties flopping
around in the air.

01:25:11.021 --> 01:25:14.358
Mr. Biggs, Mr. Van Der Beek-
I just wanted to say hi. I'm-

01:25:14.608 --> 01:25:15.859
Banky-fucking Edwards!

01:25:16.026 --> 01:25:18.111
Just the mother fucker we came to see.

01:25:18.278 --> 01:25:20.864
What the fuck are you guys doing here?

01:25:26.703 --> 01:25:28.163
Why the hell are you shooting at me?

01:25:28.372 --> 01:25:29.206
Two reasons.

01:25:29.373 --> 01:25:32.626
One- we're walking-taking
bad girl clichés.

01:25:32.793 --> 01:25:34.628
And two- because you're a man!

01:25:36.254 --> 01:25:37.965
Only on the outside.

01:25:38.715 --> 01:25:40.550
Stop the movie? Are you crazy?

01:25:40.717 --> 01:25:42.511
All these assholes on the internet
are calling us names...

01:25:42.803 --> 01:25:44.596
because of this fucking stupid movie.

01:25:44.805 --> 01:25:47.265
That's what the internet is for-
slandering others anonymously.

01:25:47.474 --> 01:25:50.686
Stopping the flick
isn't gonna stop that.

01:25:55.399 --> 01:25:56.400
This isn't fair.

01:25:56.566 --> 01:25:58.443
We came to Hollywood, I fell in love.

01:25:58.610 --> 01:26:01.154
We stole a monkey, we got shot at...

01:26:01.405 --> 01:26:03.740
and I got punched
in the motherfucking nuts...

01:26:03.907 --> 01:26:06.034
by a guy named Cock-knocker.

01:26:06.243 --> 01:26:08.370
I feel for you boys, I really do.

01:26:08.537 --> 01:26:10.580
But Miramax - you know, Miramax films...

01:26:10.831 --> 01:26:13.333
paid me a shitload of money for
Bluntman & Chronic.

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:16.628
So it occurs to me that people
bad-mouthing you on a website...

01:26:16.753 --> 01:26:19.798
is none of my fucking concern!

01:26:20.007 --> 01:26:21.967
Oh, but I think it is.

01:26:25.178 --> 01:26:28.390
We had a deal with you on the comics-
for likeness rights?

01:26:28.598 --> 01:26:30.559
And as we're not only
the artistic basis

01:26:30.767 --> 01:26:32.269
but also the character basis...

01:26:32.477 --> 01:26:34.813
for your intellectual property,
Bluntman & Chronic...

01:26:34.938 --> 01:26:37.858
when said property was optioned
by Miramax films...

01:26:37.941 --> 01:26:40.736
you were legally obliged to
secure our permission...

01:26:40.902 --> 01:26:43.280
to transfer the concept
to another medium.

01:26:43.447 --> 01:26:45.741
As you failed to do that, Banky...

01:26:45.782 --> 01:26:47.993
you are in breach of
the original contract.

01:26:48.201 --> 01:26:49.536
Ergo, you find yourself...

01:26:49.745 --> 01:26:53.540
in a very actionable position.

01:26:57.711 --> 01:26:59.004
You guys are gonna ruin my movie career

01:26:59.212 --> 01:27:01.381
We want something
for our mental anguish.

01:27:01.465 --> 01:27:03.508
Tell you what-
we'll settle this monetarily.

01:27:03.717 --> 01:27:05.260
I'll give you half of what I make.

01:27:05.469 --> 01:27:06.303
Half?

01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:07.095
Half's not good enough?

01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:09.056
Fine. I'll give you two thirds.

01:27:09.306 --> 01:27:10.599
Fuck you, you already said half.

01:27:10.807 --> 01:27:12.684
You can't take it back.

01:27:12.893 --> 01:27:13.894
Done.

01:27:19.941 --> 01:27:22.110
Your shit is so tired, Justice.

01:27:22.569 --> 01:27:26.573
Call me Boo-Boo-Kitty-fuck... Bitch!

01:27:36.333 --> 01:27:38.877
Hello? Truce?

01:27:42.756 --> 01:27:44.508
I think I killed both of them.

01:27:45.258 --> 01:27:46.510
I am an excellent marksman.

01:27:46.593 --> 01:27:47.552
I've always-

01:27:52.015 --> 01:27:53.100
C'mon, you guys, it's over.

01:27:57.980 --> 01:27:59.356
Are you alright, Boo-Boo-Kitty-fuck?

01:27:59.523 --> 01:28:01.692
I was just about to jump in
and get your back.

01:28:03.944 --> 01:28:04.569
The cops!

01:28:04.736 --> 01:28:06.363
We gotta get out of here.

01:28:06.405 --> 01:28:08.031
I'm tired of running.

01:28:09.449 --> 01:28:12.077
Marshall... are you awake?

01:28:12.869 --> 01:28:14.538
Wake up.

01:28:14.705 --> 01:28:18.709
My God! I'm paralyzed.

01:28:18.875 --> 01:28:21.545
That monkey shot me in the ass
and paralyzed me.

01:28:22.504 --> 01:28:24.923
Oh, sweet irony!

01:28:25.132 --> 01:28:25.716
You're not paralyzed.

01:28:25.882 --> 01:28:28.969
It was just a tranquilizer.

01:28:29.219 --> 01:28:30.846
Jesus.

01:28:31.722 --> 01:28:33.807
Tranqued by a little monkey.

01:28:33.974 --> 01:28:36.768
My friends in the Bureau will
never let me hear the end of this.

01:28:37.644 --> 01:28:39.396
You have friends in the FBI?

01:28:39.563 --> 01:28:41.732
They all made it in
but I failed the exam.

01:28:41.982 --> 01:28:44.651
Why else do you think I became a
Federal Wildlife Marshall?

01:28:45.819 --> 01:28:47.237
I'll tell you why, because I'm a joke!

01:28:48.322 --> 01:28:49.781
Maybe not.

01:28:50.699 --> 01:28:52.451
I can make you a deal
that'll get you into the FBI...

01:28:52.576 --> 01:28:54.077
regardless of test scores.

01:28:54.786 --> 01:28:56.538
What kind of deal?

01:28:56.747 --> 01:28:58.749
You get the charges dropped
against Jay and Silent Bob...

01:28:58.915 --> 01:29:00.292
and say you never found the ape.

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:02.586
In exchange I will give you
the diamonds we stole...

01:29:02.836 --> 01:29:04.796
and turn in Missy, Chrissy,
Sissy and myself.

01:29:05.088 --> 01:29:06.548
But I want a reduced sentence.

01:29:06.757 --> 01:29:08.550
You'd be willing to do that?

01:29:12.554 --> 01:29:15.515
For him, I'd be willing to do anything.

01:29:21.897 --> 01:29:25.233
I'm a international jewel thief
who's facing a jail sentence.

01:29:25.609 --> 01:29:27.569
That's alright.
I'm a junkie with a monkey.

01:29:27.736 --> 01:29:29.738
If I go to prison will you wait for me?

01:29:29.946 --> 01:29:31.198
I don't know.

01:29:31.365 --> 01:29:33.450
Will you fuck me when you get out?

01:29:40.457 --> 01:29:41.083
Don't change the subject.

01:29:41.249 --> 01:29:42.876
Will we fuck when you get out?

01:29:43.043 --> 01:29:44.628
Snoogens.

01:29:51.718 --> 01:29:55.430
There's a lot of love in the room.

01:29:55.889 --> 01:29:59.518
Regardless of what you may here heard,
I do not kiss guys.

01:30:00.143 --> 01:30:01.228
Okay.

01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:04.523
Play it cool, hotshot.

01:30:08.652 --> 01:30:11.238
Sorry, Justice. We have to go.

01:30:12.739 --> 01:30:13.991
And stop stealing monkeys.

01:30:14.241 --> 01:30:14.950
- Fuck you!

01:30:15.117 --> 01:30:16.702
- Fair enough.

01:30:21.915 --> 01:30:23.375
Wait for me.

01:30:23.583 --> 01:30:24.960
What? Here?

01:30:38.765 --> 01:30:41.101
Well, boys- you're rich, in love-

01:30:42.227 --> 01:30:43.270
You're in love-

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:45.188
And to top it off
you've got your own monkey.

01:30:45.397 --> 01:30:47.357
What more could two guys from
Jersey possibly want?

01:30:48.191 --> 01:30:50.360
To have these fucks stop talking
shit about us on the internet.

01:30:50.444 --> 01:30:52.487
What've I been telling you?

01:30:52.654 --> 01:30:54.281
There's not much you can do
to stop that.

01:30:54.531 --> 01:30:57.576
Short of showing up at their house
and beating the shit out of them.

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:09.546
All the money we're making could
buy a lot of plan tickets.

01:31:15.719 --> 01:31:16.303
Yeah?

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:19.556
Do you post as Magnolia Fan
on Movie Poop Shoot. Com?

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:22.559
Yeah!

01:31:22.726 --> 01:31:26.521
Did you write
"Fuck Jay and Silent Bob."

01:31:26.730 --> 01:31:29.232
"Fuck them in their stupid asses"?

01:31:29.399 --> 01:31:31.151
Yeah, a while ago. So?

01:31:40.827 --> 01:31:45.165
On Movie Poop Shoot.com did
you say Jay and Silent Bob are...

01:31:45.332 --> 01:31:47.960
quote, "fucking clown shoes
and if they were real...

01:31:48.168 --> 01:31:50.253
"I'd kick the shit out of them for
being so stupid"?

01:31:50.504 --> 01:31:51.797
- Yeah.
- Really?

01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:16.196
That's right. That's it.

01:32:20.117 --> 01:32:26.498
Right. That's right.

01:32:49.813 --> 01:32:51.440
That's beautiful, man.

01:32:51.648 --> 01:32:53.859
That was worse than Clash Of The Titans

01:32:54.067 --> 01:32:56.111
I can't believe Judy Dench played me.

01:32:56.403 --> 01:32:59.406
Remind me to renew
that Restraining Order.

01:32:59.656 --> 01:33:00.115
Why?

01:33:00.324 --> 01:33:02.409
I am gonna blast that
flick on the internet tonight.

01:33:02.659 --> 01:33:05.329
Why can't Hollywood ever makes
a decent comic book movie?

01:33:05.495 --> 01:33:06.955
Tell me, Steve-Dave.

01:33:06.997 --> 01:33:08.332
Would you stop saying that?

01:33:08.498 --> 01:33:11.376
That was just another paean
to male adolescence...

01:33:11.585 --> 01:33:13.211
and its refusal to grow up.

01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:15.881
Yeah, sis,
but it was better than Mall Rats.

01:33:16.089 --> 01:33:18.967
At least Holden had the good
sense to keep his name off of it.

01:33:19.176 --> 01:33:22.512
Why wouldn't Miramax option his
other comic instead?

01:33:22.679 --> 01:33:26.266
The one with you and him
and your relationship.

01:33:26.433 --> 01:33:28.477
Chasing Amy?

01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:30.479
That would never work as a movie.

01:33:30.687 --> 01:33:32.939
I'm so fucking embarrassed.

01:33:33.106 --> 01:33:34.316
Honey, you should be.

01:33:34.524 --> 01:33:35.484
They took your characters...

01:33:35.692 --> 01:33:38.236
and turned them into one
90-minute long gay joke.

01:33:38.445 --> 01:33:40.030
It was like watching Batman
and Robin again.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:43.450
Thank, that means a lot coming from
the guy who pretends be "Shaft"...

01:33:43.533 --> 01:33:46.078
as opposed to the guy who takes shaft.

01:33:46.119 --> 01:33:48.372
I don't hear you complaining nightly.

01:33:48.455 --> 01:33:50.666
I don't get out to the movies much,
but I have to say...

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:53.418
Bluntman & Chronic was blut-tastic.

01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:56.004
Are these leg cuffs really necessary?

01:33:56.213 --> 01:33:58.632
Don't make me shoot you, Justice.

01:34:00.384 --> 01:34:03.095
The party's across the street featuring
the greatest band in the world...

01:34:03.136 --> 01:34:05.722
Morris Day and the Time.

01:34:25.242 --> 01:34:26.952
I...

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.079
I... I been watching you.

01:34:29.329 --> 01:34:31.707
I think I want to know you.

01:34:32.833 --> 01:34:35.585
I said... l’m a little dangerous.

01:34:36.837 --> 01:34:40.215
Girl I'd love to show you...

01:34:40.424 --> 01:34:43.468
my jungle love.

01:35:53.246 --> 01:35:56.625
I'd be like, "What, you don't know
fucking Jay and Silent Bob...

01:35:56.833 --> 01:35:59.503
the fucking mack-daddies of
fucking Jersey"?

01:35:59.670 --> 01:36:01.797
And she'd be like "Oh, I read on
the internet that you guys..."

01:36:02.005 --> 01:36:04.257
"are a couple of little fuck-holes!"

01:36:44.798 --> 01:36:46.717
I got a bear skinned rug.
Y'all sing it.

01:36:48.468 --> 01:36:50.637
I got a fireplace. I can't hear you.

01:36:52.306 --> 01:36:54.349
We're all the way live in L.A.

01:36:55.976 --> 01:36:58.562
Oh, the things I could do to you.

01:37:42.522 --> 01:37:48.779
