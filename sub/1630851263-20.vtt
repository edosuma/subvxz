00:29.942 --> 00:32.597
Hurry, Titans.
Gather the rations!

00:32.641 --> 00:35.035
We stockpiling, yo!
We stockpiling.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.732
Well, stockpile faster!

00:38.081 --> 00:40.040
- What's going on?
- What does it look like?

00:40.083 --> 00:42.172
We're doomsday prepping!

00:42.216 --> 00:44.522
We have enough
of the weapons for everyone

00:44.566 --> 00:46.176
and also for their mothers.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.222
Activating doomsday protocols.

00:59.972 --> 01:02.192
Hmm. Sorry to rain
on your apocalypse.

01:02.236 --> 01:04.214
But according to this, the end
of the world isn't scheduled

01:04.238 --> 01:05.891
for another three years.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.391
We're not prepping for the end
of the world, Raven.

01:07.415 --> 01:10.200
We're prepping for Doomsday,
the supervillain.

01:10.244 --> 01:12.898
You know, the strongest,
dumbest, most formidable

01:12.942 --> 01:14.552
of all supervillains.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.772
And the one who wears
the shortest of the shorts.

01:20.254 --> 01:22.430
Oh, that Doomsday.

01:23.431 --> 01:24.606
Oh, no.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.477
He is the here.

01:26.521 --> 01:29.219
It's all good, Mama.
We'll be safe inside the tower.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.265
Cyborg, did you lock
the back door?

01:31.308 --> 01:32.614
We have a back door?

01:39.186 --> 01:40.448
you think he saw us?

01:45.453 --> 01:47.411
We's trapped, yo.
We's trapped!

01:50.632 --> 01:52.112
What are you doing?

01:52.155 --> 01:53.243
You're the leader.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.244
You should be the first to die.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.680
No. You die first.

01:55.724 --> 01:59.945
- No, you.
- No, you.

01:59.989 --> 02:02.122
Woah, woah, woah.
I'm not gonna hurt you guys.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.167
You're not?

02:04.211 --> 02:06.169
No, I wanna be friends.

02:06.213 --> 02:08.302
You do know that you are
the destroyer

02:08.345 --> 02:09.955
of the world, correct?

02:09.999 --> 02:11.716
And didn't you almost kill
the Justice League?

02:11.740 --> 02:13.785
Yeah, but only because
they started it.

02:13.829 --> 02:16.179
Look, I'm not a bad guy.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.876
I'm just misunderstood.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.965
But why do you want
to be friends with us?

02:20.009 --> 02:21.706
Because you're
the only superhero team

02:21.750 --> 02:23.795
that knows what it's like
to be misunderstood.

02:23.839 --> 02:25.710
Plus, if I'm friends
with you guys,

02:25.754 --> 02:27.147
then maybe
other superheroes will

02:27.190 --> 02:28.670
let their guard down
and trust me.

02:28.713 --> 02:32.195
Oh... he's tugging
on the heartstrings.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.806
Well, clip those strings.

02:34.850 --> 02:37.635
Because superheroes
and supervillains can't
be friends.

02:37.679 --> 02:38.723
It's a rule.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.203
I'm sorry, Doomsday,

02:40.247 --> 02:42.988
you're just going
to have to kill us instead.

02:43.032 --> 02:45.513
- Starting with Beast Boy.
- Hey!

02:45.556 --> 02:48.168
I thought
you guys would be different.

02:48.211 --> 02:49.908
I guess I was wrong.

02:49.952 --> 02:52.084
Wrong indeed, Doomsday!

02:52.128 --> 02:53.390
We're not different,

02:53.434 --> 02:54.759
we're just as jerky
as everyone else.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.045
- Probably more so.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.568
- Now go home!

02:57.612 --> 02:58.656
I can't.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.615
Superman destroyed my home.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.575
- Really?
- That is so uncool.

03:04.619 --> 03:06.229
And it's also not our problem.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.013
Uh, that's okay.

03:08.057 --> 03:12.104
I'll just stay
at a cheap m-motel.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.335
Aww.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.207
Perhaps it would be
possible for him

03:27.250 --> 03:29.426
to stay with us
just for the few days?

03:29.470 --> 03:31.211
No way!

03:31.254 --> 03:33.865
Look at him. His massive body
doesn't even fit in here.

03:33.909 --> 03:35.519
I don't fit in anywhere!

03:40.307 --> 03:42.047
There, there, little big guy.

03:42.091 --> 03:43.527
I just want to be liked.

03:45.486 --> 03:47.401
Come on, Robin. Have a heart.

03:47.444 --> 03:48.576
Fine. He can stay.

03:48.619 --> 03:49.619
Just stop crying.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.582
But only for a few days.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.366
And this doesn't mean
we are friends.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.107
- Oh, thanks, pal.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.240
You're not going
to regret this.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.768
Oops.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.771
Throw that ring. Throw
that ring. Throw that ring.

04:13.165 --> 04:14.384
Nice throw.

04:14.428 --> 04:16.560
And the nice catch to you.

04:16.604 --> 04:17.735
Yo, Robin,

04:17.779 --> 04:19.346
wanna play with our new friend?

04:20.521 --> 04:22.610
No. And he's not our friend!

04:24.220 --> 04:25.220
Suit yourself.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.006
I got it!

04:33.795 --> 04:34.883
Where did Robin go?

04:38.974 --> 04:40.410
Sorry about that.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.109
I'm going
to my room.

04:44.153 --> 04:45.154
Ow...

04:48.636 --> 04:50.464
You like that, Doomsday?

04:50.507 --> 04:51.595
- How about this?

04:53.205 --> 04:55.033
And this.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.952
What do
you want now, Doomsday?

05:00.996 --> 05:02.824
Hey, Robin, uh, can I use
your computer?

05:02.867 --> 05:04.347
How?

05:04.391 --> 05:05.957
You can't even fit
through the door.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.001
Sure I can.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.789
You just destroyed my wall!

05:11.833 --> 05:13.965
No, it was like that
when I got here.

05:14.009 --> 05:16.011
Ooh, nice. Open concept.

05:16.054 --> 05:19.536
A shared space, that's also
somehow less confining.

05:19.580 --> 05:20.798
Can you do that to my room?

05:20.842 --> 05:22.583
Ooh. And my room as well.

05:24.106 --> 05:25.107
No, no.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.980
- Don't forget mine too, yo.
Okay.

05:29.024 --> 05:31.156
- And mine.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.375
Yeah, no problem.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.376
Wait.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.508
That's a load-bearing wall.

05:40.252 --> 05:41.252
Ow.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.389
Where are we going?

05:46.433 --> 05:48.391
We're taking you
to get ice-cream, baby.

05:48.435 --> 05:49.566
- Wow.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.394
I've never had
ice-cream before.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.918
- What? How's that
even possible, yo?

05:53.962 --> 05:55.877
Well, I don't get out much.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.531
I tend to cause a scene
wherever I go.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.545
It's gonna
take forever

06:11.588 --> 06:12.589
to get through this line.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.379
It's Doomsday. Run!

06:21.076 --> 06:22.860
You don't have to run away.

06:22.904 --> 06:25.341
Just because I'm big and spiky
doesn't mean I'm a bad guy.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.300
I didn't even do
anything wrong.

06:28.344 --> 06:30.564
No. But you did get us
to the front of the line.

06:33.262 --> 06:36.396
You know, maybe we can
be friends after all.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.614
- Really?
- Yep.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.224
Because you've just shown me

06:39.268 --> 06:41.313
how I can profit
from being your friend.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.620
And that makes all
the difference in the world.

06:43.664 --> 06:46.101
Woo-hoo! Friends!

07:24.139 --> 07:26.489
I'm sure he's looking
to beat me up again.

07:26.533 --> 07:30.145
We cannot let the Superman be
mean to our new friend.

07:30.188 --> 07:33.104
But how are we supposed
to stop Superman? He's like,

07:33.148 --> 07:35.455
the most powerful superhero
in the world.

07:35.498 --> 07:36.978
We just need
to figure out a way

07:37.021 --> 07:39.110
to show him
that Doomsday is a good guy.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.590
I know.

07:40.634 --> 07:42.679
You should invite
Superman to a party.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.614
Then he can see that
I'm friends with superheroes

07:44.638 --> 07:45.769
and learn to trust me.

07:45.813 --> 07:48.598
That is a great idea, Doomsday.

07:48.642 --> 07:49.686
We can play games.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.123
And jump in the bouncy castle.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.604
Ooh. We can have
a bouncy castle?

07:54.648 --> 07:56.780
I don't see why not?

07:56.824 --> 07:58.129
Ow, let go!
- Thank you, Robin.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.479
- Ow, you sting!
- Thank you.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.350
You're impaling me
with your spikes.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.438
Oh, right.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.006
Sorry.

08:05.049 --> 08:06.486
Woo!

08:06.529 --> 08:09.184
This bouncy castle is
awesome, yo!

08:09.227 --> 08:11.665
My turn. Yeah! Woo-hoo!

08:13.449 --> 08:15.625
Wow. That was fun.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.322
What a great party.

08:17.366 --> 08:19.020
You think
Superman will show up?

08:19.063 --> 08:20.543
Absolutely.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.850
He can't resist if he knows
Doomsday is here.

08:22.893 --> 08:26.375
Question is, will he come
to fight or to party?

08:26.418 --> 08:28.508
Look! Up in the sky.

08:28.551 --> 08:31.249
It is not the bird,
nor the plane,

08:31.293 --> 08:32.860
it is the Superman.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.911
Go on, Doomsday. Say hello.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.523
Oh. Thank you for coming
to my party, Superman.

08:43.566 --> 08:44.566
Would you like some cake?

08:48.876 --> 08:50.660
Hey. Not cool, dude.

08:50.704 --> 08:53.533
You were right, Doomsday.
Superman is a super jerk.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.578
Eh, that's okay.
I've got another idea.

08:57.493 --> 08:59.582
No, no, Superman.
It's not an attack.

08:59.626 --> 09:00.801
It's for the pinata.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.674
Here, you can go first.

09:15.729 --> 09:16.773
Get him, Superman.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.560
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.407
He's eating the cake.

09:42.451 --> 09:43.887
He trusts you.

09:43.931 --> 09:46.281
Superman's finally seeing
the real you.

09:46.324 --> 09:49.240
Yes, yes, you're seeing
the real me.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.070
Oh, no. Something's wrong.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.420
What type of the cake is that?

09:55.464 --> 09:56.334
Ice-cream cake.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.075
What flavor?

09:58.119 --> 09:59.468
Cookies and kryptonite.

10:01.296 --> 10:02.340
What?

10:03.951 --> 10:05.605
Oh, no. Does he not like it?

10:05.648 --> 10:06.808
That's one way of putting it.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.349
Thanks for helping me
destroy Superman.

10:11.393 --> 10:13.656
You Titans are the best.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.745
Did we just help him do
what I think we just did?

10:15.789 --> 10:17.921
I believe we are
the accomplices.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.836
Uh, let's get out of here, yo.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.318
Sorry, Superman.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.146
Turns out we were not
prepped for Doomsday.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.190
Catch you later.
