<i>- Are you ready?
- - Give me a sec.</i>

00:37.537 --> 00:39.371
<i>- You're ready now?
- I said give me a sec.</i>

00:39.373 --> 00:41.440
<i>That was one second.</i>

00:41.442 --> 00:42.908
<i>Very funny.</i>

00:44.611 --> 00:46.645
<i>Hi. Hi. Hello.</i>

00:48.482 --> 00:49.648
<i>Okay, yeah, I'm ready.</i>

00:49.650 --> 00:52.017
<i>All right.
Here we go.</i>

00:53.087 --> 00:54.987
<i>I'm going to
take you now.</i>

00:54.989 --> 00:57.956
Not now.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.726
<i>That was not
a request, Lucy.</i>

01:00.728 --> 01:03.228
Ow! Stop! Charlie!

01:03.230 --> 01:06.331
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>for you to reap what</i>
<i>you've sewn.</i>

01:06.333 --> 01:08.534
- <i> Sewn. Sewn.</i>

01:08.536 --> 01:11.970
<i>I'm the master.
You are my mistress.</i>

01:13.273 --> 01:16.508
W-w-wait but...
But, Charlie...

01:20.447 --> 01:21.847
Babe, that's your line.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.249
"Charlie rips off
Lucy's bloomers

01:24.251 --> 01:27.786
and enters her from behind.
It's animalistic.

01:27.788 --> 01:30.589
Passion exuding out
of every pore."

01:31.724 --> 01:32.991
Is this for real?

01:32.993 --> 01:34.693
- Yeah.
- Is that a real thing?

01:35.762 --> 01:37.830
Babe, this is not good.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.898
This is not good writing
and it's actually, like

01:39.900 --> 01:42.634
very degrading to women
and I feel like

01:42.636 --> 01:45.304
we sort of see eye to eye
on the feminism issue.
You know what I mean?

01:45.306 --> 01:47.439
Can we just do
another take, please?

01:47.441 --> 01:52.010
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
Find out what
it means to you.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.078
Alright, from the top.

01:53.080 --> 01:56.582
From the animalistic
fucking or before that?

01:56.584 --> 01:58.817
- Can we just...
- You want to get right before
the animalistic fucking?

01:58.819 --> 01:59.985
Can we just take
it from the top?

01:59.987 --> 02:02.221
The top of the fucking
or the top of the scene?

02:20.374 --> 02:23.642
- You want me to get you off?
- No, I'm okay.

02:23.644 --> 02:27.513
Oh god, I can't believe
I ate all that
ice cream last night.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.882
I had a crazy
fucking dream.

02:29.884 --> 02:32.985
- I feel so fat.
- I wish.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.722
- Shut up.
- <i> Yeah, another 20 pounds...</i>

02:36.724 --> 02:38.490
You're such a liar.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.692
You're right.
Thirty, thirty-five pounds

02:42.997 --> 02:44.229
Shut up.

02:45.432 --> 02:48.033
We're on this train
to India.

02:49.536 --> 02:53.305
And it was like, all these
snakes on board.

02:53.307 --> 02:58.810
These like little spiders.
There's like, like something
about little spiders.

03:00.780 --> 03:03.582
I can't remember.
And you were there
and you almost

03:03.584 --> 03:07.619
got attacked by, like
this lion or something
like that. And like,

03:07.621 --> 03:11.056
I tried, I tried to
save you and I couldn't.

03:11.058 --> 03:13.225
I kept going like,
"I should have
gotten that gun."

03:13.227 --> 03:14.626
I should have
gotten that gun.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.296
- I should have
gotten that gun.
- Mm...

03:18.464 --> 03:20.704
May be you should
write a movie about that.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.302
I don't
need suggestions.

03:24.404 --> 03:26.405
- I thought you were stuck.
- I'm not stuck.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.309
I think I'm going to
get a gun.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.178
- We can't have guns.
- Why not?

03:34.714 --> 03:36.114
We're liberals.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.951
I don't give a shit.

03:38.953 --> 03:42.554
When shit goes down,
we're gonna want guns.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.157
I mean, I think we should
probably get jobs first.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.888
- <i> Hey!</i>

05:22.890 --> 05:26.224
All right. Looking good, babe.
Sexy mama-ma-ma-mam-ma.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.927
I have a meeting
with my agent.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.029
He said he wanted me to
just come by today

05:31.031 --> 05:33.498
to talk about
some projects and stuff.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.435
- Do I look okay?
- I mean, you look amazing,
if that's all right.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.271
- Hmm. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

05:39.273 --> 05:40.872
What's your deal today?
You're writing?

05:40.874 --> 05:42.507
Yup. Feeling inspired.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.042
- Really?
- Fuck, yeah, babe.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.611
- Bye. Love you.
- Bye. Bye.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.947
- I made you a PB & J.
- You're the best.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.249
Also, Jim's out there
smoking pot.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.118
Don't just go
smoke pot with him, okay?

05:53.120 --> 05:56.188
All right. I don't even
do that. I will not.
I cannot and I won't.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.856
No, you can't.
Because I'm getting old

05:57.858 --> 05:59.524
and my eggs are
about to shrivel up
and die

05:59.526 --> 06:01.793
and I want to
have your babies
and a happy family.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.129
And so we need to work hard
and make money, okay?

06:04.131 --> 06:05.411
I'll all about it.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.700
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.635
You're eggs aren't gonna
shrivel up and die.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.171
Yeah, they are.
Don't smoke pot.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.340
Smoke what? I couldn't...
I'm sorry.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.502
I don't...
I couldn't hear you.

06:18.578 --> 06:19.845
Love you.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.128
Hey. How're you doing?

06:36.130 --> 06:38.663
- How's, how's Katie?
- We're good.

06:39.031 --> 06:40.332
Good.

06:41.534 --> 06:44.035
Ever bother you that
she's such an ass-kicker?

06:44.904 --> 06:46.705
And you're just a stoner?

06:48.207 --> 06:51.209
- I'm not just a stoner.
- Of course you are.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.645
She's not
just an ass-kicker.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.248
- No one's just one thing.
- For sure, man.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.151
Yeah, that's wh...
That's really what
makes human beings

06:59.519 --> 07:01.586
so awesome.

07:01.588 --> 07:05.724
Is that it's our flaws
that make us beautiful.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.794
And only when
you can love yourself

07:09.762 --> 07:12.230
can you truly love
somebody else.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.835
Where do you
get this stuff, man?

07:16.837 --> 07:20.205
It's out there, you know.
In the air.
You just gotta listen.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.641
Listen, and the universe
will tell you
all it's secrets.

07:23.075 --> 07:24.709
No. The weed.

07:24.711 --> 07:27.646
Oh. My cousin grows it
up in North Cal.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.047
Nice.

07:49.902 --> 07:52.737
- Smoking hot, right?
- Yeah!

07:52.739 --> 07:55.307
I wish
I was like that.

08:02.014 --> 08:04.783
Wh... I-I-I...
I love that you just...

08:05.451 --> 08:07.085
You just stopped by.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.587
- Yeah.
- <i> That's great.</i>

08:08.589 --> 08:10.288
Oh, uh, great take

08:10.290 --> 08:12.791
for, uh, Master's Maiden
by the way.

08:13.759 --> 08:15.126
- Oh!
- Mm-hmm.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.194
- Good!
- Mm-hmm.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.730
Great. Thanks.
Yeah.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.032
Which, which take
did you choose?

08:21.034 --> 08:23.668
Oh, what you sent,
it was great.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.370
There were...
I sent two takes.

08:25.372 --> 08:29.774
One was like, more um,
I think just grounded.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.110
- Mm-hmm.
- And the other was
kind of like...

08:32.111 --> 08:35.547
Just a little bit more frantic.
More like...

08:35.549 --> 08:37.682
It was great.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.284
You-you-you're familiar
with the book

08:40.287 --> 08:43.388
The Erotic Fictions of
Nineteenth Century England?

08:43.390 --> 08:44.856
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Of course you are.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.492
I mean, chicks love
that S&M shit.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.060
It's sexy stuff.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.695
- Yeah, really,
I went through that book.
- Mm-hmm.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.431
- Super fast.
- I mean, how about Bryan?

08:53.433 --> 08:56.134
Right? Going straight
from an Oscar to directing

08:56.136 --> 08:58.336
a cable mini series.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.871
- Crazy.
- Crazy.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.007
I guess he's obsessed
with the book
or some shit.

09:02.009 --> 09:05.577
I hear he's a fucking
maniac, but I mean,
talent's talent. Right?

09:05.579 --> 09:08.747
Speaking of
the devil,

09:08.749 --> 09:11.917
Rebecca Moss had that part
at the audition for unlocked.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.019
But she's like, great now.

09:14.021 --> 09:17.622
So she had to drop out
last minute to shoot this
new P.T Anderson thing.

09:17.624 --> 09:18.924
Everybody's pissed off.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.359
Uh, I mean, obviously
going with you would be
like, you know,

09:21.361 --> 09:23.094
a completely
different direction,

09:23.096 --> 09:25.797
but, uh, you know,
they start shooting
next week, so...

09:25.799 --> 09:28.800
they're fucked
if they don't find somebody.

09:29.101 --> 09:30.502
Oh, good.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.187
You have any
movie ideas, Loafie?

10:21.555 --> 10:25.056
- <i> Hey.</i>
- Hey! How's writing going?

10:25.058 --> 10:27.225
- Great.
- <i> Are you stoned?</i>

10:28.027 --> 10:29.995
<i>- No.</i>
- Are you sure?

10:30.596 --> 10:32.764
Yes, I'm sure.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.866
- What's wrong?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

10:34.868 --> 10:36.434
<i>Are you sure?</i>

10:36.436 --> 10:38.470
I'm kinda
in the zone here, babe.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.472
<i>Oh! Okay, super,
super quick.</i>

10:40.474 --> 10:43.341
Casting loved my
Master's Maiden tape.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.043
Oh, that was
the sex one, right?

10:45.045 --> 10:49.414
It's not just the sex one.
It would be a huge
opportunity for me.

10:49.416 --> 10:53.084
Bryan J. Macy is directing.
And he wrote it,
and he's gonna play the lead.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.486
He sucks.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.787
<i>He just won an Oscar.</i>

10:55.789 --> 10:58.089
Yeah, well,
awards are stupid.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.557
What is wrong with you?

10:59.559 --> 11:01.493
<i>Nothing. I'm great.</i>

11:01.495 --> 11:04.663
Other than the fact
that I'm broke
and can't sell a movie.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.431
I mean, I think you need to
write one first.

11:07.433 --> 11:08.713
Fuck money.

11:08.934 --> 11:10.268
Fuck money?

11:10.270 --> 11:13.510
Just bummed people
need money for stuff.
It sucks.

11:14.306 --> 11:15.674
Okay.

11:15.676 --> 11:16.975
<i>Well, I just pulled up
out front</i>

11:16.977 --> 11:19.110
<i>and I'm gonna need
a new pilates tape.</i>

11:19.112 --> 11:21.379
So can I
use the living room?

11:21.381 --> 11:24.149
Um, I'm using the space
right now.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.651
- For how long?
- For as long as it takes.

11:26.653 --> 11:28.720
Well, can you
give me an estimate?

11:28.722 --> 11:32.242
By the way, you know
you're not gonna get a job
just by working out, right?

11:32.526 --> 11:35.694
Like you're the
supreme expert on
how to get a job.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.796
You fucked Alex Wilson Dickson,
by the way.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.297
Where's that coming from?

11:39.299 --> 11:42.333
It comes from me
having to see his stupid face
on billboards everyday

11:42.335 --> 11:44.102
for his stupid,
not-funny show.

11:44.104 --> 11:47.806
Rebecca Moss is on the cover
of fucking <i> Perceive.</i>

11:47.808 --> 11:48.940
Oh, give me a break.
Okay?

11:48.942 --> 11:51.142
She gave me
half a blowjob one time

11:51.144 --> 11:52.610
You had full sex with him.

11:52.612 --> 11:55.013
No, I didn't.
I just hooked up with him.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.581
And what is
half a blow job?

11:56.583 --> 11:59.751
Well, apparently, it's
half the amount of blowjob
you gave Alex Wilson Dickson.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.420
By the way,
we're going there. Tonight.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.956
He's having that
dinner party at his house.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.459
So, can you please
just figure out a way
to get over it?

12:07.461 --> 12:09.360
I'm not going to that shit.
All right? I already told you.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.829
I hate your
stupid actor friends.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.764
They sit around,
just trying to pump
each other up.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.699
- Trying to act like
their life is so great.
- Such a dick!

12:14.701 --> 12:16.634
Which, I got
news for them,
they're not!

12:16.636 --> 12:18.570
Okay? I got other shit
to do, by the way.

12:18.572 --> 12:21.406
I'm sorry, but smoking pot
and jerking off,

12:21.408 --> 12:23.074
does not constitute
other shit to do.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.610
Okay, I was not
jerking off.

12:25.612 --> 12:28.713
I'm not going to that thing
because I'm going shopping
for a gun.

12:28.715 --> 12:31.316
You're going
gun shopping?
Like, tonight?

12:31.318 --> 12:35.386
I'm gonna start in the daytime.
In late afternoon, probably,
when my schedule clears up,

12:35.388 --> 12:38.189
and then I'm gonna continue
until I find the gun
that I like.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.758
It's probably gonna
take me into nightfall.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.093
- Why do you want a gun?
- For protection.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.996
- From what?
- From the fucking
elements, babe.

12:44.998 --> 12:48.733
- Are you kidding me?
From evil.
- Evil?

12:48.735 --> 12:51.302
You're a vulnerable woman.
You need to be protected.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.837
That's where I come in
With a gun.

12:52.839 --> 12:56.374
Honestly, if you
wanna protect me,
then make some money.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.209
You think money's gonna
keep you fucking secure

12:58.211 --> 13:00.011
when someone is
banging down your door

13:00.013 --> 13:02.514
trying to steal
your fucking food
and kill you?

13:02.516 --> 13:05.683
No one's gonna bang
down our door if we're
living in Hollywood Hills.

13:05.685 --> 13:08.286
- Why not?
- Because we're in the Hills.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.455
Away from violent,
hungry people.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.991
Those people, they can't
walk up a hill, then?

13:12.993 --> 13:15.059
- No!
- Why not?

13:16.362 --> 13:18.096
Because they're too hungry.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.964
You're fucking...
Are you kidding me?

13:19.966 --> 13:21.766
It's not a joke.
That's for real.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.835
You kidding me?
That is so idiotic!

13:23.837 --> 13:26.171
That is the most fucking
idiotic thing I've ever heard!

13:26.173 --> 13:28.439
You know what?

13:28.441 --> 13:30.742
If you think money's
gonna keep you secure,
go ahead and leave me.

13:30.744 --> 13:32.710
All right? And then,
just go marry
some rich dick head

13:32.712 --> 13:34.512
like Alex Wilson Dickson.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.981
How about that?
Alex Wilson Dickson.

13:36.983 --> 13:40.585
You're mouth, it's already
been in there. So that's like
sort of old territory for you.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.487
- Fucking stuck in his dick.
- Honestly... Honestly...

13:42.489 --> 13:45.590
- You can marry him and
get a bunch of fucking money.
- If it's between a rich dude

13:45.592 --> 13:48.092
- and Mr. Fuck Money...
- Listen to me. Be quiet.

13:48.094 --> 13:51.162
- I have to buy a gun
so I can feel like a man?
- Be quiet and listen to me.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.698
You can have money and then
you're gonna mistake that
for a sense of self worth.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.634
- I will fucking
marry a rich dude.
- I promise you you're still
gonna fucking hate yourself.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.436
- You're such a dick!
- You're still gonna
hate yourself.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.138
- You're such a fucking...
Fuck you!
- I'm not a dick.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.506
- It's the fucking truth.
- You are a dick!

14:01.508 --> 14:03.007
I should answer that.
I have to answer that.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.075
It's the fucking truth.
Why?

14:04.077 --> 14:05.944
- It's my agent.
- So what?

14:05.946 --> 14:07.979
- Fucking take it.
- Hello?

14:07.981 --> 14:09.113
<i>Hi Katie.</i>

14:29.935 --> 14:31.236
What?

14:33.706 --> 14:35.940
I got the part.

14:35.942 --> 14:39.744
- What? What part?
- The Master's Maiden.

14:39.746 --> 14:43.948
I guess Bryan J. Macy
watched my tape
and said I was his...

14:43.950 --> 14:46.150
He said I was his girl.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.419
So I got it.

14:48.854 --> 14:50.221
I'm, um...

14:50.223 --> 14:52.557
Production starts
next week in England.

14:54.126 --> 14:55.860
Isn't that insane?

14:57.830 --> 15:00.098
This is gonna be huge!

15:00.100 --> 15:04.102
- Okay.
- Oh my God!
I have to stop eating.

15:04.104 --> 15:07.238
I'm gonna be in like
corsets and shit.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.674
- Fuck!
- How long are you
gonna be gone for?

15:09.676 --> 15:11.809
- Six months.
- Ohh!

15:11.811 --> 15:13.745
You'll come visit,
obviously.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.413
Why? So I can have
front row seats

15:15.415 --> 15:18.917
to Bryan J. Macy
fucking my girlfriend?

15:19.818 --> 15:21.185
No, thank you.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.855
I can't believe you're
making this about you
right now.

15:23.857 --> 15:26.124
This is a huge
opportunity for me.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.426
- I gotta go.
- Where?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.762
- Coach improv.
- Okay.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.045
Wait...

15:39.438 --> 15:41.339
I can't be seen
drinking OJ.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.942
Do you know what kind
of political ramifications
there'll be?

15:43.944 --> 15:45.543
I'm a black man.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.279
- Black men drink OJ.
- Listen. Stop, guys.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.214
This is why Capital Hill's
going downhill.

15:50.216 --> 15:53.217
Scene. Okay, um...
That's was okay.

15:54.053 --> 15:55.954
Was it?
I don't, I don't know.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.356
Be real.
Make a decision.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.825
What's unusual?
Play that, okay?
Next scene.

16:00.827 --> 16:04.429
Hey, roomie,
don't, uh, don't forget
the rent's due next week.

16:04.431 --> 16:08.166
Oh, no, I totally forgot.
I'm completely broke
right now.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.467
What?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.769
What are you talking about?
What are we supposed to do?

16:11.771 --> 16:14.405
Well, if you can find
a way to cover me, I can

16:15.107 --> 16:17.909
maybe find a way
to repay you?

16:17.911 --> 16:20.011
I'm not quite sure
what you mean by that.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.180
You know, I could
do you a favor.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.448
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.583
Like, a special
sexy kind of favor.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.884
What do you mean
by special?

16:26.886 --> 16:29.287
- You know what I mean.
- Scene.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.189
Okay, great,
so what's the joke, uh...

16:31.191 --> 16:32.690
Sorry, what's
your name again?

16:32.692 --> 16:34.192
Abigail. Or Abby.
Either ways.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.494
Abigail. Okay.
So what's the joke?
Like, what's the game?

16:36.496 --> 16:37.762
That you're trying
to be sexy?

16:37.764 --> 16:40.131
- Ye-yeah...
- What is that?

16:40.133 --> 16:42.200
Okay, here's the thing.
Like, here's
a better question.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.135
Where does that lead?

16:44.137 --> 16:46.504
You know what I mean?
What if he says yes?
Then what?

16:46.506 --> 16:48.039
Like, you guys
have improv sex?

16:48.041 --> 16:51.009
So what? We sit here
and watch you guys
like do this?

16:51.011 --> 16:53.845
You have like improv sex.
You know what I mean?
It seems funny and cute.

16:53.847 --> 16:57.248
The problem is
it's a slippery slope.
You know what I'm saying?

16:57.250 --> 16:59.517
It's like, first you're
having improv sex,
then you're okay with that.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.019
The next thing you know,
you're auditioning

17:01.021 --> 17:02.353
to be someone's
sexual submissive.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.856
And then after that,
you're letting some
Oscar-winning fuck head

17:04.858 --> 17:08.092
stick his dick in you
because that's what you think
it takes to be an actor.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.162
Mm-hmm.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.364
Okay.

17:15.501 --> 17:16.666
Next scene,

17:24.544 --> 17:25.843
Don't take me wrong.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.479
No, I...
Don't get me wrong.

17:28.481 --> 17:32.116
I'm incredibly grateful
for my job for so many
different reasons.

17:32.118 --> 17:36.087
I mean, not the least
of which is that it's made
me a heavy-hitter
in the Twitter-sphere

17:36.089 --> 17:37.955
Which I don't really
care about...

17:37.957 --> 17:40.458
- I... No, honestly, I don't.
- It counts.

17:40.460 --> 17:45.096
Well, it does. I mean,
it's, uh, an amazing platform
for my charity work, so...

17:45.098 --> 17:48.433
And then you've got the cast
and, uh, and the crew
is amazing.

17:48.435 --> 17:51.169
Except for...
you know who.

17:51.171 --> 17:54.038
I'm not gonna say any names.
I don't like saying
anything bad about anybody.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.374
But you know
who I'm talking about.

17:56.376 --> 17:59.277
And yet, some days,
you just think,

18:00.646 --> 18:02.680
"Is this really making
the world a better place?"

18:02.682 --> 18:08.052
You make tens of
millions of people
laugh every week.

18:08.054 --> 18:11.189
You cannot underestimate
the power of that.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.925
No, I-I-I don't. I don't.
I appreciate it.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.527
I just... You know,
sometimes it gets
a little rough when you're...

18:19.398 --> 18:22.767
Fuck.
I'm such a douche.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.635
- No, you aren't.
- I am.

18:24.637 --> 18:28.172
- We totally get it.
- Wait a minute.
Stop this.

18:28.174 --> 18:30.241
This... Tonight is
about you.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.509
- Beautiful...
- Stop.

18:31.511 --> 18:35.413
No, it is. I just want to
say congratulations
on your job.

18:35.415 --> 18:38.816
Th-This is gonna be huge
for you. Huge!

18:39.518 --> 18:41.119
- To Katie.
- Thank you.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.453
Come here.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.224
Eww.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.626
You know how long
it's been since New York?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.828
Ugh, god, so long.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.697
- Do you remember <i> oeuvre oui?</i>
- Yes!

18:52.699 --> 18:53.831
- Yes?
- Of course I remember.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.600
- And the village culture?
- Yes!

18:55.602 --> 18:58.603
You were amazing.
No, you were.
You were.

18:58.605 --> 18:59.871
- You were
<i>- No.</i>

18:59.873 --> 19:01.973
- You stole that show.
- Remember the
last night party?

19:01.975 --> 19:05.409
- At that pub!
- Oh, I'm surprised
you remember.

19:05.411 --> 19:08.112
This one gets up
on the bar,
unprompted, mind you,

19:08.114 --> 19:11.015
and grabs on
to one of the pipes
and starts pole dancing.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.317
I forgot about that!

19:13.319 --> 19:15.319
Yeah, I didn't.
I didn't forget.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.988
'Cause then
I walked you home.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.759
- Yeah.
- Right?

19:26.865 --> 19:27.965
I'm sorry.

19:27.967 --> 19:30.067
- Hey, no, no, no.
- No, it takes you back.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.836
Don't be sorry,
dude. Okay?

19:31.838 --> 19:35.173
I'm glad that you guys
hooked up.
I think it's awesome.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.775
You can even probably
say that I'm kinda stoked
that you guys hooked up.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.578
We all need lovin'.
Right? We're all human.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.714
I wasn't around back then.
I'm glad you were
to give it to her, okay?

19:43.716 --> 19:45.249
'Cause, hey,
what are you gonna do?

19:45.251 --> 19:48.986
Not hook up with somebody
on the closing night
of <i> ooboo qua?</i>

19:48.988 --> 19:51.522
You know what I mean?
After she did
a sexy pole dance?

19:51.524 --> 19:53.391
Are you kidding me?

19:53.393 --> 19:57.028
In New York City?
Sexiest city
in the whole world.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.730
It's awesome.
I'm so, I'm so...

19:59.732 --> 20:02.200
I'm so pumped
that you guys hooked up
that night.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.601
- Yeah.
- - Awesome.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.151
Great.

20:08.174 --> 20:10.541
When I'm acting,
um, I'm the character.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.311
Character's me.

20:14.813 --> 20:16.614
- There's no difference.
- Hmm.

20:16.616 --> 20:19.050
- I don't get
into character.
- Hmm.

20:19.052 --> 20:22.620
<i>There is no process</i>
<i>of approaching</i>
<i>the character.</i>

20:22.622 --> 20:27.291
<i>And there is no process</i>
<i>of removing myself</i>
<i>from the character.</i>

20:27.293 --> 20:30.661
<i>Transcendent words
from a transcendent man.</i>

20:30.663 --> 20:32.597
- <i> Bryan J. Macy...</i>
- What are you looking at?

20:32.599 --> 20:34.131
- <i> My pleasure.</i>
- Nothing.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.433
<i>And now...</i>

20:38.303 --> 20:39.770
What are you
looking at?

20:40.739 --> 20:43.207
Nothing.
Just... whatever.

21:08.967 --> 21:10.301
Okay.

21:16.708 --> 21:19.510
You know,
you still haven't
said congratulations.

21:41.034 --> 21:43.367
This is a
huge job for her.

21:43.369 --> 21:44.969
You need to
support your girl.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.937
I know, man.
It's just...

21:46.939 --> 21:49.707
Just so far away.
So long.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.777
All right, that all
may be true

21:52.779 --> 21:55.446
but I don't think
that's what's really
bothering you.

21:56.081 --> 21:58.049
What're you
talking about?

21:58.051 --> 22:00.885
Your girlfriend is
playing Lucy Brighton

22:00.887 --> 22:03.187
in The Master's Maiden
where she plays the maiden

22:03.189 --> 22:05.356
who's taken on
a long journey

22:05.358 --> 22:07.458
into the depths
of sexual ecstasy.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.628
Where the lines
of pleasure and pain
are blurred.

22:10.630 --> 22:13.064
- You read the book?
- Five times.

22:13.066 --> 22:15.499
Look, I get it.
It must be weird.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.601
Uh, I don't know.
I've never dated
an actress.

22:17.969 --> 22:19.337
It's weird.

22:19.339 --> 22:22.039
Plus it's pay cable
so she'll have to show
her boobs a whole bunch.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.307
Right?

22:23.309 --> 22:24.575
I mean, it's like
basically porn.

22:24.577 --> 22:25.943
Why is she
agreeing to do this?

22:25.945 --> 22:28.379
Master's Maiden
is not porn.

22:28.381 --> 22:29.547
It's beautiful.
You should read it.

22:29.549 --> 22:30.915
I'm good.

22:30.917 --> 22:35.353
Okay, look. I understand
that on a primal level,
this must be hard.

22:35.355 --> 22:36.854
You know, thinking of
the woman you love,

22:36.856 --> 22:39.957
being physical
with another man,
even if it is just acting.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.827
But think about her.
Put yourself
in her shoes.

22:42.829 --> 22:45.329
She's gonna be
freaking out right now.

22:45.331 --> 22:48.065
With her body issues,
and what not.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.900
Come on, man,
the last thing she needs

22:49.902 --> 22:53.342
is her boyfriend
making her feel like
she's a whore.

22:57.442 --> 22:58.743
That's my two cents.

23:14.826 --> 23:17.161
Oh boy, she's up.
She's up. She...

23:17.929 --> 23:19.397
What's all this?

23:50.962 --> 23:52.730
Congratulations, Katie.

23:54.232 --> 23:55.666
<i>Me and Loafie made this.</i>

23:58.771 --> 24:00.104
Thanks, babe.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.207
That's so sweet.

24:07.979 --> 24:10.499
I'm sorry for
how I reacted.

24:10.582 --> 24:12.716
You're a beautiful,
sexy woman

24:12.718 --> 24:15.078
and you deserve to
embrace that.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.288
You should dive into
this experience.

24:17.290 --> 24:18.656
I'm gonna be right there
with you. Okay?

24:18.658 --> 24:21.178
- I want to be the man who
supports you in this.
- Okay.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.128
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

24:25.398 --> 24:28.165
- Thanks. I love you.
- I love you too.

24:31.103 --> 24:33.704
- You smell good.
- Thanks.

24:33.706 --> 24:36.207
- That is so sweet.
- You smell good.

24:37.443 --> 24:39.210
Hey!

24:42.582 --> 24:43.981
I'm dominating you.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.985
What?

24:47.987 --> 24:51.188
I'm the master.
I'm dominating you.

24:52.390 --> 24:55.526
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
babe, I can't hear
what you're saying.

24:57.096 --> 25:00.798
You know, like,
like Master's Maiden.
I'm the mast... never mind.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.766
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

25:02.768 --> 25:05.736
Now I get it. Babe,
I just couldn't hear you.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.638
No, I'm sorry.
Forget it.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.708
What? No. No. It's great.
You can be the master.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.309
- No.
- Yeah. Come...

25:12.311 --> 25:14.945
Babe, you're the master.
You're dominating me.

25:14.947 --> 25:17.948
- Don't patronize me.
- I'm... Babe, I'm not.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.384
I'm not. I'm just
a fragile little girl

25:20.386 --> 25:23.587
that's helpless under
your domineering power.

25:23.589 --> 25:26.624
I need you to keep
dominating me.

25:27.926 --> 25:30.961
Seriously.
It's turning me on.

25:30.963 --> 25:33.831
Fine. I'll keep
dominating you.

25:34.933 --> 25:36.200
Okay.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.152
Dominating you.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.382
Take me again.

25:51.950 --> 25:53.551
I got another one in me.

25:53.553 --> 25:58.489
Before the lark sings,
dear god, take me again.

26:00.091 --> 26:02.026
It's from the script.

26:02.028 --> 26:04.261
Isn't that beautiful?

26:04.263 --> 26:05.896
I love that line.

26:06.831 --> 26:09.033
Do you wanna
do it again, though?

26:09.035 --> 26:10.968
I should work out.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.137
Okay.

26:13.672 --> 26:15.105
Mm.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.114
Bryan J. Macy wants to
get together tonight

26:24.116 --> 26:25.683
and discuss
character stuff.

26:25.685 --> 26:28.052
Oh, yeah?
That's awesome.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.887
- Isn't that insane?
- Yeah.

26:31.289 --> 26:33.424
Oh, wait,
it's your show tonight.

26:33.426 --> 26:36.193
That's okay. I mean,
you know, obviously
this is more important.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.095
I love coming
to your shows.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.431
You're very sweet.
But babe, you've gotta go.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.766
- You're the best.
- I know that.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.868
- Thanks for understanding.
- Yeah.

26:44.870 --> 26:46.036
Gotta spoil my girl.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.538
- My god!
- What?

26:47.540 --> 26:49.306
What am I
going to wear?

26:49.308 --> 26:51.241
Oh, Jeez.

26:53.479 --> 26:56.347
The toughest decision
of all, huh? Okay.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.885
You may not
care about yourself,

27:02.787 --> 27:05.022
but maybe you will talk,

27:05.024 --> 27:10.027
If I promise not to
hurt your girlfriend.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.684
Whoa, whoa, whoa
whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:15.934 --> 27:17.134
Girlfriend?

27:22.273 --> 27:23.974
Who said,
who said girlfriend?

27:23.976 --> 27:26.376
I-I feel like we're
just kinda hanging out.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.684
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

27:41.894 --> 27:42.993
Wow!

27:45.097 --> 27:47.264
It's so beautiful here.

27:47.266 --> 27:48.546
Yeah. Yeah.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.169
I wish I was a boat.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.605
Maybe then I'll feel
still inside.

27:54.607 --> 27:57.941
Every time I get back on land,
the restlessness returns.

28:02.014 --> 28:06.583
I love that you sail.
What a powerful thing to do.

28:06.585 --> 28:12.156
It's like... Wrestle
with the wind and
the ocean like that.

28:15.628 --> 28:18.362
I have these moments
when I'm out on the boat.

28:18.364 --> 28:21.065
You find a line,
you get locked into it,

28:21.067 --> 28:23.587
everything else
just fades away.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.936
Wow.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.682
I need you to let go.

28:39.617 --> 28:42.119
- Of what?
- Of everything.

28:42.121 --> 28:46.490
Nothing can come
in between us.
Not right now.

28:47.859 --> 28:49.393
I agree.

28:59.305 --> 29:00.804
My god,

29:02.474 --> 29:04.074
you're so beautiful.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.286
Bryan, I-I should
tell you.

29:17.122 --> 29:19.156
I have a boyfriend...

29:20.225 --> 29:21.592
That I live with.

29:30.401 --> 29:32.561
I think
that's wonderful.

29:49.754 --> 29:51.855
Brother, Jackson.
Good show, man.

29:51.857 --> 29:54.024
Nice, what you got
going here.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.326
- Oh, what's your name?
- - Seriously?

29:56.328 --> 29:58.168
- Take it easy.
- How's it goin'?

30:09.374 --> 30:11.675
- Hey. Good show.
- Hey.

30:11.677 --> 30:13.644
- Thank you.
- It's Abigail.

30:13.646 --> 30:15.345
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
Thanks for coming.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.080
Yeah, I've seen you
perform like, three times.

30:17.082 --> 30:20.083
- You're amazing.
- Thank you.

30:20.085 --> 30:21.785
So, I'm sorry about
the other day in class

30:21.787 --> 30:24.421
with that whole sexy,
how-do-I-pay-my-rent
scene.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.456
So embarrassing.
And you were totally right.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.492
I just don't want you
to think I'm like a slut
or anything...

30:28.494 --> 30:31.428
No, no, no, no, no...
I... That's
totally my fault.

30:31.430 --> 30:35.465
I was just going
through like weird
personal shit, you know.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.167
But like, definitely
don't worry about it.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.536
- Okay? You're doing great.
- Thanks.

30:40.405 --> 30:41.605
Um, well, I know

30:41.607 --> 30:43.240
that technically
I'm like your student
or whatever,

30:43.242 --> 30:44.541
so maybe this is weird.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.944
But I have
a lot of weed
in my car

30:46.946 --> 30:48.378
and no one
to smoke it with.

30:48.380 --> 30:52.100
Is there any chance
you want to come
smoke some with me?

30:54.652 --> 30:58.088
Jump <i> by Kriss Kross</i>
<i>and</i> Jump Around
<i>by House of Pain.</i>

30:58.090 --> 31:01.758
- Mm-hmm
- '92 was the year
for jumping songs.

31:01.760 --> 31:02.893
End of story.

31:02.895 --> 31:05.829
Yeah, but like,
in '83,

31:05.831 --> 31:08.932
you had
<i>Jump for My Love</i>

31:08.934 --> 31:13.136
The Pointer Sisters,
the greatest grouping of
musicians ever born.

31:13.138 --> 31:15.205
- Oh, yeah?
- Heck, yeah.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.274
And <i> Jump</i> by Van Halen.

31:17.276 --> 31:21.111
- So, can't sleep on '83.
- Ah, very true.

31:21.113 --> 31:23.080
- Fresh greens?
- Cool. Thanks.

31:23.082 --> 31:24.281
Mm.

31:25.149 --> 31:26.483
I probably shouldn't
tell you this

31:26.485 --> 31:29.052
'cause I don't want you
to think I'm like,
a stalker or whatever

31:29.054 --> 31:32.289
but I have seen like
every one of your videos.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.991
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

31:33.993 --> 31:36.593
Cool. Thanks.
There's some
clunkers in there.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.028
Well, I like them.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.296
- That odd?
- Yeah.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.899
Oh! And I love
that web series you did

31:41.901 --> 31:43.834
like, with a girl
about a couple
moving in together.

31:43.836 --> 31:46.770
- Mm-hmm.
- Who's that girl with you?
She looks so familiar.

31:46.772 --> 31:47.938
Uh, my girlfriend.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.873
Oh. Cool.

31:53.678 --> 31:54.958
Really stoned.

31:55.813 --> 31:57.373
- Right?
- Yeah, me too.

31:59.285 --> 32:01.385
-<i> Muchas gracias</i>
for the herbage.
- Yeah.

32:01.387 --> 32:05.989
Appreciate that.
May Jah bless you
on your journey.

32:05.991 --> 32:08.191
- Thank you.
- Okay.

32:09.827 --> 32:11.561
Oh, hey, um...

32:11.563 --> 32:12.963
Can I get your number?

32:13.932 --> 32:15.165
Not for like a date
or anything.

32:15.167 --> 32:16.600
I'm starting
another improv group

32:16.602 --> 32:18.168
and we wanted you
to be our coach.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.270
Oh, yeah, for sure.
Cool.

32:21.572 --> 32:22.839
Cool.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.181
- You're cold.
- Yeah.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.517
- Wear my jacket.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's okay.

32:33.519 --> 32:36.420
Sam, give her
my jacket, please.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.988
Oh, you...
I really don't need it.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.656
Oh, all right.

32:40.725 --> 32:42.559
Thanks.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.027
Thank you.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.199
Can I, can I have one?

33:03.282 --> 33:05.716
You know,
women shouldn't
smoke cigarettes.

33:07.285 --> 33:08.919
I don't really.

33:08.921 --> 33:10.687
It's really disgusting.

33:12.056 --> 33:13.256
Here.

33:18.196 --> 33:19.496
Open it.

33:27.805 --> 33:31.475
Oh my god,
you're Bryan J. Macy.

33:31.477 --> 33:34.578
- I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
What's your name?

33:34.580 --> 33:36.513
- Huge fan. I'm Eric.
- Hey.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.182
Hey, game of chess,
I gotta tell you
that, uh...

33:39.184 --> 33:41.184
You know I wanted to
be a teacher,

33:41.186 --> 33:43.487
but I was
addicted to drugs

33:44.989 --> 33:48.058
<i>- Meant a lot to me.
- I'm sorry, man.</i>

33:48.060 --> 33:50.560
- It's a pleasure
to meet you.
- Thanks.

33:51.429 --> 33:52.763
It means a lot.

33:52.765 --> 33:54.965
- Good to see you.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

34:06.011 --> 34:08.545
I desperately await
my punishment.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.784
I desperately await
my punishment.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.554
Eagerly.
Eagerly await my punishment.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.599
- What's going on champ?
- Oh, hey, babe.

34:30.902 --> 34:34.371
- What you got on there?
- Uh, Bryan gave it to me.

34:34.373 --> 34:38.275
It's just I guess to
work on character stuff
or something.

34:38.277 --> 34:39.743
Is that what you're
wearing on the show?

34:39.745 --> 34:41.844
Uh, I mean,
not this exactly.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.746
I was researching
corsets from that period

34:43.748 --> 34:45.114
and this is actually
a little too modern.

34:45.117 --> 34:46.650
But, yeah,
something like this.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.552
- Do you like it?
- Love it.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.786
Oh, also, I woke up
to a text from Bryan

34:50.789 --> 34:53.422
saying that he wants
to have us over
to his house tonight

34:53.425 --> 34:57.185
for a little dinner
slash meet and greet
with the producers.

34:58.029 --> 35:00.464
- It's gonna be
tough for me.
- Why?

35:00.466 --> 35:03.567
It's just the writing.
You know, had a lot of
breakthroughs yesterday

35:03.569 --> 35:05.836
and, I mean,

35:05.838 --> 35:07.971
gotta see them through.
Gotta strap myself
to the beast.

35:07.973 --> 35:09.539
I mean, you know
how it is.

35:09.541 --> 35:12.776
Uh, well, could you
just not be that late?

35:12.778 --> 35:15.278
Life of an artist,
you know. It's tough.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.480
I'm gonna try
and make it though.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.548
I'll definitely try
and be there.
What time is it?

35:18.550 --> 35:20.110
- Eight.
- Eight. Ohh!

35:23.721 --> 35:24.855
I'll make it work.

35:26.225 --> 35:29.459
You submit a personal
firearms eligibility
check application

35:29.461 --> 35:31.928
along with 20 bucks
and your ID.

35:31.930 --> 35:35.265
Get that notarized
and include your
right thumb print.

35:35.267 --> 35:38.869
That's gonna take
38 to 120 days
to come back.

35:38.871 --> 35:42.072
Then you're gonna
want to take the personal
handgun safety test

35:42.074 --> 35:43.340
which is 30 questions...

35:43.342 --> 35:44.908
I'm gonna go
and cut you off
right there.

35:44.910 --> 35:47.110
This all
feels like a lot.

35:47.112 --> 35:50.747
- You know what I mean?
- Uh...

35:50.749 --> 35:54.951
Is there any way...
Would you kinda
just like...

35:55.553 --> 35:57.387
Bypass the red tape?

35:58.756 --> 36:00.724
Uh, in what way?
What do you mean?

36:01.492 --> 36:02.859
How can I put this?

36:02.861 --> 36:04.261
You know,
like in <i> Taxi Driver,</i>

36:04.263 --> 36:06.997
when he goes and he meets
that guy in the hotel room.

36:06.999 --> 36:09.032
And the guy's got
all the briefcases
full of guns.

36:09.034 --> 36:11.301
And he's like,
that's a .38 Magnum.

36:11.303 --> 36:12.669
That's a snub nose.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.971
I just sell
high quality goods
to the right people.

36:15.706 --> 36:17.906
Do you have
any stuff like that?

36:18.142 --> 36:19.309
Get out.

36:21.812 --> 36:24.614
- Leave the store.
- Okay, I'm just
gonna just...

36:24.616 --> 36:25.749
Let me throw
this one at you.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.817
I'll give you $72 cash
up front for that shotgun,

36:27.819 --> 36:30.139
no questions asked,
out the door.

36:30.388 --> 36:33.490
Absolutely not.
Leave now.

36:35.259 --> 36:36.379
Okay.

36:54.512 --> 36:57.914
Thank you, thank you,
thank you
for seeing me last minute.

36:57.916 --> 37:02.052
I am like
freaking out about this.

37:02.054 --> 37:04.921
It's so much pressure.

37:04.923 --> 37:08.203
You're like, the only
acting teacher
I trust in LA.

37:13.931 --> 37:15.131
Okay.

37:16.734 --> 37:18.802
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.137
Hi. Aah!

37:24.208 --> 37:25.976
So what can I
do for you, Katie?

37:25.978 --> 37:31.147
Uh, well, I told you
in the email I think
that I got this part.

37:31.149 --> 37:35.885
"Master...
The Master's Maiden."

37:35.887 --> 37:37.921
The Master's Maiden.
Okay.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.223
Which, you know...

37:40.225 --> 37:43.159
I mean, that's gonna
be like huge.

37:43.161 --> 37:45.528
Mm. What's huge about it?

37:51.035 --> 37:53.169
- Yeah...
- Mm-hmm?

37:55.306 --> 37:56.640
He's so...

37:58.142 --> 38:00.543
Yeah. Totally.

38:01.379 --> 38:04.614
Why do you think
you attracted this part

38:04.616 --> 38:06.683
at this point
in your life?

38:07.551 --> 38:09.886
Maybe like,
something about...

38:13.724 --> 38:16.493
Being sexy?

38:16.495 --> 38:18.628
Do you think
you're sexy enough
to play this part?

38:20.965 --> 38:24.634
I mean, I guess I am.
Or they wouldn't have cast me.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.937
- Right?
- I don't know.

38:30.608 --> 38:35.345
Uh, so yeah,
can we just go over
some of the...

38:35.347 --> 38:37.113
Love yourself.

38:38.249 --> 38:39.516
Okay.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.252
Yeah. Okay.

38:43.321 --> 38:47.724
Love... yourself.

38:50.561 --> 38:52.961
I mean I do,
pretty much.

39:06.545 --> 39:10.780
<i>Hey, yeah, hi.</i>
<i>This is Paul.</i>
<i>Katie's boyfriend.</i>

39:12.283 --> 39:14.517
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

39:14.519 --> 39:16.920
Wait there.

39:16.922 --> 39:21.891
Remember, okay, we are
the last line of defense
for these poor villagers.

39:23.395 --> 39:27.297
I look up
and, and I see this kid,

39:28.432 --> 39:31.134
no more than six years old.
No shirt, no shoes,

39:31.136 --> 39:33.703
running towards me
as fast as he can.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.607
He's shivering...

39:41.045 --> 39:44.080
- Hey.
- Mr Macy's not
expecting you.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.248
Uh, well,
my girlfriend...

39:45.250 --> 39:47.217
Look, you're not
on the list,
I can't let you in.

39:47.219 --> 39:49.486
All right, look.
I'm just gonna call her.

39:55.192 --> 39:56.359
What am I gonna do?

39:58.330 --> 40:00.830
I can leave
this, this child.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.298
And I remembered
where I am.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.300
Lieutenant's yelling at me,
"Come on, come on!"

40:04.302 --> 40:05.435
Gotta get back
on the helicopter.

40:05.437 --> 40:08.471
So I-I-I grabbed this child
up in my arms

40:08.473 --> 40:11.608
and I...
I run for the helicopter,

40:11.610 --> 40:13.250
and all of a sudden,
just pop!

40:15.713 --> 40:17.080
His head explodes.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.186
How...

40:24.756 --> 40:27.590
Fucking voice mail, dude.
Damn it! Look.

40:27.592 --> 40:30.860
I get it. You're here
to protect Bryan
from like crazy
stalkers and shit.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.762
I'm not that.
I wouldn't be here

40:32.764 --> 40:35.131
if my girlfriend
wasn't doing some
shitty series with him,

40:35.133 --> 40:36.366
to be honest with you.

40:36.368 --> 40:38.435
Not even a fan
of Bryan J. Macy.

40:38.437 --> 40:41.171
Actually think he's
kind of a hack.

40:41.972 --> 40:44.207
Still not gonna
let you in.

40:44.209 --> 40:47.010
Yeah. Well,
I'm gonna go then.

40:47.012 --> 40:52.549
I always thought the line
between life and death
was thin.

40:55.587 --> 40:57.720
But it took that moment
for me to know

41:00.991 --> 41:03.426
there is no line at all.

41:04.829 --> 41:05.995
Wow.

41:06.597 --> 41:10.266
That is so
powerful, Bryan.

41:10.268 --> 41:12.535
Yeah. It is.

41:16.607 --> 41:17.974
Aah!

41:17.976 --> 41:19.976
- The fuck!
- Paul?

41:21.011 --> 41:23.246
Hey.

41:23.248 --> 41:26.416
Sorry, I'm sorta
breaking into your house,
Bryan J. Macy. Uh...

41:27.384 --> 41:28.451
Your guy wouldn't
let me in.

41:28.453 --> 41:29.986
Katie wasn't
picking up her phone.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.655
Oh, I'm sorry.
My phone, it was inside.

41:32.657 --> 41:33.937
It's cool, babe.

41:35.125 --> 41:37.093
- Cool tiny bridge, man.
- Hey, what the fuck...

41:37.095 --> 41:40.230
Dennis, Dennis, it's okay.
It's all right.
He can stay.

41:40.232 --> 41:42.332
Hey, I'm sorry I went
behind your back, man.

41:42.334 --> 41:45.502
- Yeah, man.
- Thank you.

41:45.504 --> 41:48.872
He's a good guy and...
He just wouldn't
let me in. I'm sorry.

41:48.874 --> 41:51.541
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.

41:51.543 --> 41:52.809
Hey.

41:52.811 --> 41:56.145
So, Paul, Bryan.
Bryan, Paul.

41:56.814 --> 41:58.281
Nice to meet you.

41:58.283 --> 41:59.916
No big deal
'cause you're here now.

41:59.918 --> 42:02.652
But I was kinda hoping
it'd just be
people from the show.

42:02.654 --> 42:03.934
What's that?

42:04.889 --> 42:06.022
No, I'm just kidding.

42:08.760 --> 42:09.993
Oh, man.

42:09.995 --> 42:11.661
Gotta watch out
for this guy, huh?

42:12.263 --> 42:13.329
Okay.

42:13.331 --> 42:15.331
- Anybody hungry?
- Hmm.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.233
- Go inside.
- What're you drinking?
Apple...

42:17.235 --> 42:19.502
- Appletini.
- You don't... Okay.

42:20.437 --> 42:22.472
- That's cool.
- Bryan made it.

42:22.474 --> 42:26.075
I trip, I looked down.
It's this guy's foot.

42:26.077 --> 42:29.746
He's been curled up
underneath one of the desks
at the preschool

42:29.748 --> 42:31.648
whacked out of his mind
on drugs...

42:31.650 --> 42:33.816
Wait, who knows
where he's been
the other two days.

42:33.818 --> 42:35.685
Parents didn't know
that he was doing...

42:35.687 --> 42:37.887
- This was his
process you know.
- ...drugs,

42:37.889 --> 42:40.557
So we're like,
get him in the wardrobe
and get him in the scene.

42:40.559 --> 42:42.992
- Right.
- I said, "Bryan, get up.

42:42.994 --> 42:45.662
We got work to do here.
Come on,
let's do the scene."

42:45.664 --> 42:47.997
- What does he say?
- What does he say?

42:47.999 --> 42:50.633
He says, "My name is Chester."

42:52.170 --> 42:54.337
- Like, the guy is
still in charac...
- Character.

42:54.339 --> 42:55.438
- Yes!
- Wow!

42:55.440 --> 42:57.140
- Big time.
- And disappeared.

42:57.142 --> 42:59.242
I can talk
about this all day.

42:59.244 --> 43:00.510
I can talk about it
all month.

43:00.512 --> 43:03.112
No, I'm just happy
to do it with
you guys again.

43:03.114 --> 43:05.348
So, Bill, you said
you're an actor, too?

43:05.350 --> 43:07.450
- Paul.
- Sorry, yeah, Paul.

43:07.452 --> 43:09.786
No, no, it's cool, man.
I'm an actor, you know.

43:09.788 --> 43:12.348
Haven't won
any Oscars.

43:17.161 --> 43:19.963
Yeah, I act. You know,
a lot of comedy stuff.

43:19.965 --> 43:21.798
Uh, Paul's an
amazing improviser.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.132
- I am all right.
- Babe...

43:23.134 --> 43:25.001
Uh, the
upright bridge?

43:25.003 --> 43:27.604
Oh, yeah, upright bridge.
Bridge service?

43:27.606 --> 43:28.938
- Yeah.
- Hmm?

43:28.940 --> 43:31.007
- The improv...
- The comedy thing...

43:31.009 --> 43:33.242
- No I don't...
- Yeah it's a comedy club.
It's real big.

43:33.244 --> 43:34.477
You should
check that out.

43:34.479 --> 43:37.447
- Pete, you gotta do that.
- It's Bill. Bill.

43:37.881 --> 43:39.161
Paul.

43:42.886 --> 43:45.021
I want to thank
all of you
for being here with me.

43:45.023 --> 43:48.591
It's uh, a real pleasure
to dine with you.

43:48.593 --> 43:53.062
But most of all,
I'd like to thank
my little Katie bear.

43:54.865 --> 43:58.668
For being so open
and willing to go
on this journey with me.

43:59.737 --> 44:01.971
This thing is about to get
so real so fast.

44:26.898 --> 44:30.967
I had this room built
halfway through my first
draft of the Master's Maiden.

44:30.969 --> 44:33.836
I refused to enter it
till it was complete.

44:33.838 --> 44:36.172
I wanted to experience it
for the first time.

44:36.874 --> 44:38.241
Just like Lucy.

44:39.443 --> 44:43.946
To really get inside of her
while I was writing.

44:46.451 --> 44:48.551
What was that like for her?

44:51.722 --> 44:55.191
To feel
a level of arousal that

44:56.093 --> 44:57.927
she's probably never known.

45:04.536 --> 45:06.469
Is she's scared?

45:07.638 --> 45:08.971
Excited?

45:10.340 --> 45:12.008
Maybe a little of both?

45:15.880 --> 45:18.047
The smell of the leather.

45:19.416 --> 45:20.917
What does that do to her?

45:33.465 --> 45:34.897
Her life,

45:36.233 --> 45:38.601
as she had
always understood it,

45:40.270 --> 45:41.637
changed.

45:43.307 --> 45:45.508
In an instant.

46:01.359 --> 46:04.127
- Hello.
-<i> Hi Katie. This is Jason</i>
<i>Shepard's manager...</i>

46:09.666 --> 46:15.071
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.
Okay, thanks. Bye.

46:20.677 --> 46:21.978
What was that all about?

46:25.249 --> 46:27.316
I'm leaving
tomorrow now.

46:27.318 --> 46:29.652
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

46:29.654 --> 46:32.755
Something about
the location backing out
or something.

46:32.757 --> 46:34.223
I don't know.

46:37.228 --> 46:39.708
Do you know what time
you're leaving yet?

46:39.763 --> 46:42.832
- Car's coming at noon.
- Fuck!

46:46.003 --> 46:47.737
Oh!

46:47.739 --> 46:50.973
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I know, me too.

46:50.975 --> 46:53.976
Hey. What do you
want to do
on our last day together?

46:56.547 --> 46:57.980
Honestly babe.

46:58.882 --> 47:00.116
I have so much to do,

47:00.118 --> 47:02.985
I don't even know
how much time
we're gonna have together.

47:02.987 --> 47:04.654
- What?
- Ugh!

47:06.390 --> 47:07.623
What are you
talking about?

47:07.625 --> 47:10.626
I have to pack
and get a wrap.

47:10.628 --> 47:12.595
I can't believe
I drank so much last night.

47:12.597 --> 47:14.831
I'm gonna be
bloated for days.

47:15.833 --> 47:18.501
Hi. Hi, is there any
chance at all

47:18.503 --> 47:22.104
that you have time for
a detoxifying
contour wrap today?

47:22.106 --> 47:24.173
I know, okay. Thanks.

47:26.343 --> 47:28.277
You're gonna get
a wrap instead of
spend time with me?

47:28.279 --> 47:29.478
I have to, babe.

47:29.480 --> 47:32.248
I'm gonna be like naked
and shit for this thing.

47:53.371 --> 47:57.673
Love yourself.
Love myself.

47:59.343 --> 48:02.178
I love you.
I love you.

48:28.906 --> 48:32.266
What do you think Loaf?
Is this crazy or we going
to get killed or something?

48:52.195 --> 48:53.763
Oh boy!

48:54.831 --> 48:55.932
Come on, Loaf.

49:05.475 --> 49:08.210
- I just had the detoxifying
contour wrap.
- With Michael?

49:08.212 --> 49:09.478
Yes.

49:10.814 --> 49:12.748
- I have a 3 o'clock.
- Okay.

49:12.750 --> 49:14.717
- Rebecca?
- Mm-hmm.

49:14.719 --> 49:16.519
It's Katie.

49:16.521 --> 49:19.288
Uh... Um, I'm
really good friends with
Alex Wilson Dickson.

49:19.290 --> 49:21.424
He's introduced us
a couple of times.

49:21.426 --> 49:24.560
And then, um...
Also, we're both
with Gordon's at <i> Synchronous.</i>

49:24.562 --> 49:26.395
- So.
- Oh!

49:26.397 --> 49:32.101
Yeah I'm... I just had the
detoxifying counter wrap
so I must look totally insane.

49:32.103 --> 49:35.104
- I just did not
recognize you.
- I know.

49:35.106 --> 49:38.374
- How, how you been?
- Good. I'm good.

49:38.376 --> 49:41.477
It's actually so crazy
that I'm running
into you right now

49:41.479 --> 49:46.515
'cause, I'm actually going
to do that mini series that you
I guess are unavailable for.

49:46.517 --> 49:48.384
- Oh... Um...
- "Masters Maiden".

49:48.386 --> 49:53.089
- Right! Hey congrats.
- Thank you. Yeah,
but oh my God!

49:53.091 --> 49:56.625
PT Anderson, you
must be flipping out.

49:56.627 --> 49:59.428
I mean Paul's a good friend,
so when he called and
asked me to do this,

49:59.430 --> 50:01.564
I just felt like I had to
do this, you know.

50:01.566 --> 50:04.800
And secretly I was happy
to get out of that
mini series thing. I mean,

50:04.802 --> 50:08.037
doesn't it feel like your
getting tied up and fucked
over and over again

50:08.039 --> 50:09.905
in like a dungeon
or whatever.

50:09.907 --> 50:12.575
I mean, not to say
it's just uh...

50:12.577 --> 50:16.612
It's going to be an
awesome job for you.
I just mean it's um...

50:16.614 --> 50:18.714
No, yeah, I get it.
I totally get it.

50:18.716 --> 50:22.685
- Objectifying. Yeah.
- Totally. Yeah.

50:22.687 --> 50:24.920
So the contour wrap,
that works for you?

50:24.922 --> 50:27.256
Yeah, I mean this is only like
the second time I've done it,

50:27.258 --> 50:29.592
but the first time
I totally saw results.

50:29.594 --> 50:31.961
- Weird, I kinda felt
it was like bullshit.
- Really?

50:31.963 --> 50:35.765
Yeah. If I were you,
I mean this what I do when
I wanna lose weight super fast.

50:35.767 --> 50:39.101
- What?
- I just put on like, the
thickest warmest sweats

50:39.103 --> 50:41.637
I can find like a wool hat
or just whatever.

50:41.639 --> 50:45.408
A hat
and I do jumping jacks.

50:45.410 --> 50:49.111
- For three hours straight.
- Three hours?

50:49.113 --> 50:51.714
You'll wake up tomorrow
and be super skinny.

50:51.716 --> 50:54.550
- Yeah, people will be
worried about you.

50:54.552 --> 50:57.720
- I got to take this.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go, go, go.

51:00.457 --> 51:02.224
- Is that Rebecca Moss?
- Yeah.

51:03.226 --> 51:05.628
- She's so beautiful.
- Yeah.

51:08.131 --> 51:10.099
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

51:10.101 --> 51:11.367
Bye.

51:12.469 --> 51:16.605
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you soon. Bye.

51:20.277 --> 51:21.644
Gosh.

51:22.379 --> 51:23.746
Really is like
<i>Taxi Driver.</i>

51:25.082 --> 51:26.348
What?

51:39.029 --> 51:41.831
Fuck! What? Fuck!

51:46.703 --> 51:49.138
<i>Please pardon
my insolence, Master.</i>

51:49.140 --> 51:51.207
<i>'Tis wrong of me to say it.</i>

51:52.844 --> 51:55.744
Please pardon
my insolence, Master.

52:00.383 --> 52:01.717
Hello?

52:01.719 --> 52:03.352
Hey. Just checking in.

52:03.354 --> 52:04.553
<i>You okay?</i>

52:04.555 --> 52:07.289
Yeah, yeah,
just working out.

52:07.291 --> 52:09.658
How are you?
You getting writing done?

52:11.628 --> 52:14.063
You know, it's a lot of

52:14.065 --> 52:16.665
digging and
throwing stuff out
but uh, yeah, um...

52:16.667 --> 52:19.468
<i>Going to take a break.</i>
<i>Probably take Loaf</i>
<i>to the dog park.</i>

52:19.470 --> 52:25.608
- Yes, she'll love that.
-<i> And then we'll come home</i>
<i>around five like we planned?</i>

52:25.610 --> 52:27.309
Okay, great. Sounds good.

52:27.311 --> 52:29.478
<i>- Love you.</i>
- Thanks.

52:29.480 --> 52:31.413
I-I love you too.

52:33.985 --> 52:38.854
- Please pardon
my insolence, Master.

52:38.856 --> 52:41.357
Please pardon
my insolence, Master.

52:41.359 --> 52:45.094
- Hey!
<i>- Lucy, I'm downstairs.</i>

52:45.096 --> 52:48.197
-<i> Let me in.</i>
- I can't...
I'm sorry, what?

52:48.199 --> 52:51.333
<i>It's Charlie.
Open the door.</i>

52:51.335 --> 52:52.968
<i>I'm downstairs.</i>

52:55.006 --> 52:57.740
<i>Open the door.</i>

52:57.742 --> 53:01.911
Um... I'm sorry, it's not
such a great time
right now, Bryan.

53:04.247 --> 53:05.447
Call me Charlie.

53:11.121 --> 53:14.256
Okay. Yeah, just, just uh...

53:14.258 --> 53:16.025
Give me five minutes.

53:16.027 --> 53:17.126
Okay.

53:26.503 --> 53:28.337
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:28.339 --> 53:32.775
Hey, babe, I'm so sorry.
I got to push back
our plans tonight.

53:32.777 --> 53:35.511
- Why?
-<i> Because Bryan J. Macy</i>
<i>just showed up.</i>

53:35.513 --> 53:37.346
What?
At our place? Why?

53:37.348 --> 53:40.783
Yeah, yeah.
I don't know, babe.
Honestly, I don't know.

53:40.785 --> 53:42.518
He just showed up.
Can you imagine?

53:42.520 --> 53:43.953
Maybe he wants to
rehearse or something.

53:43.955 --> 53:46.055
Are you taking a bath?

53:46.057 --> 53:49.158
Yeah, obviously.
I'm all sweaty and gross.

53:49.160 --> 53:52.761
<i>I'll call you so soon.</i>
<i>We're gonna be</i>
<i>done really soon.</i>

53:52.763 --> 53:55.831
<i>- Babe, I love you.
- Okay.</i>

54:09.613 --> 54:11.080
Hello?

54:37.107 --> 54:41.143
What up? What?

54:45.048 --> 54:46.715
What did you say?

54:49.052 --> 54:51.954
What did you say?

54:51.956 --> 54:53.389
- Nothing.
- Oh.

54:53.391 --> 54:55.424
I was just waiting for you
to get closer.

54:55.426 --> 54:57.493
Oh well. Here I am.

54:57.495 --> 55:01.497
- What did you want to say?
- Nothing.

55:02.332 --> 55:05.768
- Hello.
- - Hello

55:05.770 --> 55:08.470
- Oh my God!
Is that your dog?
- Yeah.

55:08.472 --> 55:10.706
He's so cute. What's his name?

55:10.708 --> 55:13.108
- Uh, her name's Loafie.
- Oh, her name.

55:13.110 --> 55:14.777
- Sorry.
- That's quite all right.

55:14.779 --> 55:17.713
It's very common, you know.
She's not offended.

55:17.715 --> 55:19.715
I can tell.
She's a bad ass bitch.

55:19.717 --> 55:21.383
Yeah. She's a...

55:21.385 --> 55:23.686
Tough cookie. She's good.

55:30.560 --> 55:34.096
- Um...
- What's up?

55:34.098 --> 55:38.033
- Do you,
do you wanna get high?
- On weed?

55:38.035 --> 55:40.169
Yeah, yeah, on weed.

55:40.171 --> 55:41.670
- I could do that.
- Yeah?

55:41.672 --> 55:42.771
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

55:42.773 --> 55:45.341
- Do you have it?
- I mean not on me but...

55:45.343 --> 55:48.110
- At my place.
- Huh... Shit.

55:48.112 --> 55:50.979
Doesn't really help us here,
does it?

55:50.981 --> 55:54.083
I... Well... I could go back
and get it.

55:54.085 --> 55:58.120
Nah... You're already here.
You already came. It's fine.

55:58.122 --> 56:02.291
I don't have to smoke
weed all the time. I can
just be a regular human.

56:03.193 --> 56:06.428
Or we could go back to my place?

56:11.101 --> 56:13.669
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

56:13.671 --> 56:18.207
- I mean, do you wanna do that?
- Yeah, yeah, you know,
that's where the weed is.

56:19.876 --> 56:21.377
- Good point.
- Yeah.

56:21.379 --> 56:24.213
- Um...
- I'm really close.

56:24.215 --> 56:26.115
- Yeah, I'll show you.
- Okay.

56:28.585 --> 56:29.752
Okay.

56:39.697 --> 56:42.398
Ah... You'll love this song.

56:43.601 --> 56:44.800
Nice.

56:45.735 --> 56:47.536
All right.

56:47.538 --> 56:50.005
- Good work.
- - Thanks.

56:50.007 --> 56:52.408
Are you hungry?

56:53.743 --> 56:58.480
- I don't know. What you got?
- Um... Um... Let's see.

56:58.482 --> 57:03.452
I have chips... or I can heat up
some diet Mac an Cheese.

57:04.821 --> 57:09.758
- Sounds good but no, I'm okay.
- Sorry. I'm not much of a cook.

57:09.760 --> 57:12.995
- Actually so, um, do...
- It's fine.

57:12.997 --> 57:15.931
- Want a soda pop?
- Yeah, I'll take a pop.

57:15.933 --> 57:19.535
- Okay.
- I'll take a pop.

57:29.013 --> 57:32.681
- Thank you. I'll change it.
- Aw... Thank you.

57:36.086 --> 57:39.621
So what are you
working on these days?

57:40.390 --> 57:43.959
This and that.
Writing a movie.

57:43.961 --> 57:45.928
Holy shit!
That's amazing.

57:45.930 --> 57:48.230
- I'd love to read it.
- Nah, it's not done yet.

57:48.232 --> 57:50.199
Can I read some of it?

57:50.201 --> 57:54.403
- Definitely not.
- Boo. Boring.

57:54.405 --> 57:57.339
Um... I'm so hot.

57:57.341 --> 58:00.075
Last time I'm in Paris,
I took this crowning class.

58:00.077 --> 58:02.244
With this like, awesome old
French teacher

58:02.246 --> 58:04.880
who'd basically would
tell us that we sucked
and were not funny.

58:04.882 --> 58:09.418
But it was like,
amazing, you know.
Who'd always tell us like...

58:09.420 --> 58:11.920
Fuck us mean
focus, you know.

58:11.922 --> 58:13.689
Um, do you know
comedia at all?

58:13.691 --> 58:15.123
No, no I don't think so.

58:15.125 --> 58:17.726
Okay. There's this thing.
It's called
entrances and exits right.

58:17.728 --> 58:21.129
And so, you start
behind the thing and then
you just like, you enter.

58:21.131 --> 58:24.700
Right. And you have to be
in a state. It's got to be like
happy, anger, fear, sad, right.

58:24.702 --> 58:28.470
So you enter and your like right
at the audience and then
you have a partner and then

58:28.472 --> 58:32.341
you toss it to your partner
and then they take it
and toss it back to you, right.

58:32.343 --> 58:35.410
- And then, that's basically it.
- Oh.

58:35.412 --> 58:38.046
- So, yeah.
- Pretty cool.

58:38.048 --> 58:40.148
- It's pretty useful right.
- Um hm...

58:43.620 --> 58:45.654
Totally normal that
I just took my bra off right.

58:46.890 --> 58:48.557
No, it's not.

58:49.559 --> 58:51.026
Sorry.

58:51.761 --> 58:53.462
Guess, I'm just weird.

59:11.282 --> 59:13.382
No. Let's do it again.
Let's do it again.

59:13.384 --> 59:14.516
- Come on.
- Sorry.

59:14.518 --> 59:17.486
- Come on. Breathe. Fuck.
- Sorry, sorry. Okay.

59:17.488 --> 59:20.389
Oh God, I'm just a
little nervous. Oh God!

59:24.160 --> 59:26.028
Start, start over.

59:27.597 --> 59:29.364
I can do it.

59:45.014 --> 59:47.916
- You want this job?
- Of course

59:47.918 --> 59:51.086
- Why, why do you want it?
- Because...

59:53.189 --> 59:54.523
It's going to
be great and...

59:55.491 --> 59:56.992
Working with you.

59:58.928 --> 01:00:03.565
Don't do that... Katie...

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:06.535
Why do you want to be an actor?

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:09.171
Because...

01:00:09.173 --> 01:00:10.693
- I love it.
- Why?

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.709
Because...

01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:15.631
I like pretending
to be someone else.

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:23.819
Um... Am I
doing something wrong?

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:28.690
You scare me.

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:33.295
- You scare me.
- You got this production
in the palm of your hand.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:36.498
And no one knows
who the fuck you are.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.336
I mean I don't...

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:46.308
I don't really matter
as much as you do.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:50.278
You're going to be amazing
and as long as I look good,

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.949
and we have good chemistry
or whatever I think
it's going to be great.

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.727
I think you're right.

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:13.268
Where's that gift I got you.

01:01:18.542 --> 01:01:21.076
Will you teach me?

01:01:21.078 --> 01:01:23.378
What? What are you
talking about?
Teach you what?

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:26.281
Like... Teach me
how to be funny like you.

01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:29.084
- You're funny.
- I mean, thank you but like...

01:01:29.852 --> 01:01:32.154
- You are amazing.
- I know.

01:01:32.156 --> 01:01:34.790
- No seriously.
- I'm serious too.

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:39.294
- I fuck, I'm fucking serious.
- You are. I am right. No I was
watching you last night

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:42.931
and you're just like so present
when you're on stage and...

01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:45.867
So charismatic and no one
can take their eyes of you.

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:48.637
- It's hard.
- I'm being serious.

01:01:48.639 --> 01:01:52.774
I know, that's what
I'm talking about.
It's fuck... I get it.

01:01:52.776 --> 01:01:55.243
I mean, is that
just something
you have naturally like

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:57.179
or you have been
like that since you were
a kid or whatever

01:01:57.181 --> 01:01:59.381
or did you
somehow learn that?

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:01.616
I... I don't...

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:06.288
I... Both... I...
I don't know.

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:10.492
- Will you do a scene with me?
- What?

01:02:10.494 --> 01:02:12.861
- Like let's improvise
a scene right now.
- No.

01:02:12.863 --> 01:02:17.299
Come on. I'll start it. Oh wait
let me think. Uh... Okay.

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:21.547
Thank you for my
anniversary present.
I love it.

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:26.475
That's the scene. Thank you
for my anniversary present.
I love it.

01:02:26.477 --> 01:02:28.744
This is dumb.

01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:29.878
This sucks.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.614
All right. Well,
I don't know.

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:36.384
Will you just
tell me then.

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:38.153
This is ridiculous.
What are you
talking about?

01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:41.515
Just like tell me
how you do
what you do?

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:44.326
You could teach me.

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:52.834
I'll be right back,
okay.

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:54.503
Okay.

01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:28.403
Turn around.

01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:41.983
Can you submit to me?

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:44.853
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

01:03:44.855 --> 01:03:46.254
- Yes.
- Don't fuck with me.

01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:47.556
I'm not.

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:51.259
- Are you my maiden?
- Yeah.

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:52.861
- I don't believe you.
- I am.

01:03:52.863 --> 01:03:55.330
I don't think
you know
what that means.

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:59.012
I am, I am your
maiden and I
submit to you.

01:04:23.894 --> 01:04:27.729
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:31.700
What are you doing?
What... Bryan stop.

01:04:31.702 --> 01:04:34.736
- What are you doing?
- Come on, I wasn't
going to burn you.

01:04:34.738 --> 01:04:36.705
What are you... Are you insane?

01:04:36.707 --> 01:04:38.406
May be. A little.

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:44.246
<i>Hey it's Katie.
Leave me a message.</i>

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:45.647
Hey, why isn't your phone on.

01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:48.329
It's been like 3 hours.
Are you still rehearsing
or what?

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:52.787
Just call me when you can. Okay?

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.435
I went to far.

01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:23.551
It's okay.

01:05:32.229 --> 01:05:34.429
Let's keep
exploring together.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:41.569
I want to keep going.
I trust you.

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:53.114
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:56.151
I got a gun today.

01:05:56.153 --> 01:05:58.386
Are you serious?

01:05:58.388 --> 01:06:01.990
- Yep.
- Oh my God.
That is so fucking cool.

01:06:01.992 --> 01:06:03.858
- You think so?
- Fuck yeah.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.494
I mean I don't have one
but I totally get it.

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:08.897
You're gonna want one
if shit goes down right?

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:15.704
- That was exactly
what I was thinking.
- Um hm... Can I see it?

01:06:15.706 --> 01:06:19.207
- No.
- Oh come on. Please,
I've never held a gun before.

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:25.747
- Not gonna happen.
- Please. I'll be super,
super careful with it.

01:06:26.215 --> 01:06:28.083
I promise.

01:06:28.085 --> 01:06:30.352
- No way.
- Come on. Show it to me.

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:42.697
I should go.

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:49.637
- I'm gonna head out. Okay.
This is all my fault.
- No.

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:03.752
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

01:07:03.754 --> 01:07:06.321
Don't do that okay.
Why did you do that?
Why did we do that?

01:07:06.323 --> 01:07:07.856
I don't know. I like you.

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:11.793
Fuck.

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:13.661
- No stop. Don't go.

01:07:13.663 --> 01:07:14.996
I'm just. Uh...

01:07:14.998 --> 01:07:16.798
- I just... I got to go.
- Please, I'm sorry.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.034
- Come Loaf. We got to go.
- Paul, please.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.842
Do you have any idea
the size of this thing?

01:07:27.844 --> 01:07:30.879
And, and, and, and what's at
stake for me here.

01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:32.380
- Do you?
- - Of course.

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:34.949
No you don't. It's your
first fucking job.
How could you? Seriously?

01:07:34.951 --> 01:07:36.518
I mean, I did
a pilot last year.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.420
You have no idea
what it's like
to direct something.

01:07:38.422 --> 01:07:40.588
Let alone something
that you wrote.

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:43.258
I have people calling me
constantly asking me questions.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.194
I created a fucking monster here
and now it's eating me alive.

01:07:46.196 --> 01:07:51.399
- Okay.
- Look, I get it. You are
under so much pressure.

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:55.437
But you know, you're brilliant
and every one knows it.

01:07:55.439 --> 01:08:00.675
This project is going to be
huge for you. Huge!

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:02.544
Fuck!

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:06.648
And you know,
you just won
an Oscar.

01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:10.852
I mean, most people
can barely even dream
of finding that kinda success,

01:08:10.854 --> 01:08:14.456
and you did it. And you
will always have that.

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:18.660
This mini series
is gonna be amazing.

01:08:18.662 --> 01:08:25.066
But even if it isn't, you've
already proven your self
to the whole world.

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:27.535
Why am I so scared?

01:08:28.636 --> 01:08:30.604
I get it.

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:33.441
Having this kind of power
is really scary.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:56.131
I'm sorry for putting
you through all this.

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:01.803
It's okay.

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:06.140
You're a beautiful,
intelligent, sexy woman.

01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:12.113
Nobody should ever tell you
other wise.

01:09:17.988 --> 01:09:22.991
- Bryan, stop. I shouldn't.
- You said you were my maiden.

01:09:22.993 --> 01:09:26.594
- I am, but I...
- Submit to me.

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:30.331
- I... I shouldn't. I can't.
- You have to.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.902
- I...
- I'm the Master.

01:09:41.076 --> 01:09:42.343
What the fuck?

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:44.779
- Oh boy.
- Oh my God. It's not,
it's not what it looks like.

01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:46.714
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:49.082
It's Okay. No need
to get upset here. Hey.

01:09:49.085 --> 01:09:50.919
Hey, don't touch my
fucking dog man.

01:09:50.921 --> 01:09:52.819
What are you doing
with my girl friend.
Loafie come here.

01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:54.822
We were just exploring
character stuff.

01:09:54.824 --> 01:09:57.559
Exploring character stuff.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:09:57.561 --> 01:09:59.260
Hey, Don't talk to her
like that.

01:09:59.262 --> 01:10:02.163
Hey, you better watch it man.
All right. You watch it, okay.

01:10:02.165 --> 01:10:05.099
You're spending our last
night together tied up,
making out with this D-bag?

01:10:05.101 --> 01:10:07.168
- We weren't making out.
- Fuck you guys.

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:09.971
Paul, can I talk to you
for a second.

01:10:09.973 --> 01:10:12.273
Oh wow! Whoa! Oh my God!

01:10:12.275 --> 01:10:14.042
- Are you Bryan J. Macy?
- Oh boy!

01:10:14.044 --> 01:10:15.743
- Oh my God!
- What are you doing here?

01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:18.112
- Who are you?
- She's just an
improv friend of mine.

01:10:18.114 --> 01:10:19.814
Yeah, I-I'm no one.
I just followed you here

01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:22.584
because I felt like I needed
to apologize right away
for what just happened.

01:10:22.586 --> 01:10:24.919
- What just happened?
- Paul and I just kissed.

01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:27.922
- Oh!
- I know, I'm sorry.
It's totally my fault.

01:10:27.924 --> 01:10:29.691
I knew he had a girlfriend.

01:10:29.693 --> 01:10:32.660
But I'm a big fan of yours
by the way. You're great in
that web series you guys did.

01:10:32.662 --> 01:10:36.431
You... I can't believe
I'm in the same room
as Bryan J. Macy.

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:40.802
Just freaking out. Sorry,
I just wanted to say that
I'm sorry for doing that

01:10:40.804 --> 01:10:44.472
and I hope it doesn't destroy
you guys relationship in any way
because that would really suck.

01:10:44.474 --> 01:10:46.574
Wow, looks like we're not
the only ones huh?

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:48.576
- Fuck you dude.
- You fucking kissed this girl?

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.278
Who the fuck is she.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.747
Does it matter? I mean, there
is obviously something
going on between them. So...

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:56.451
- Is there?
- No there's not and you better
fucking watch it man, okay.

01:10:56.453 --> 01:10:59.387
- 'cause I will shoot you
in the face. I am not kidding.
- Paul, calm down.

01:10:59.389 --> 01:11:01.022
- Oh... You're gonna
shoot me in the face.
- Yeah.

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:03.157
- Shoot me. What the fuck
you're gonna shoot me with?
- With my gun.

01:11:03.159 --> 01:11:05.093
- Oh...
- He doesn't have a gun.

01:11:05.095 --> 01:11:07.262
- Yes he does.
- Then go ahead. Come on.
Pull your gun out.

01:11:07.264 --> 01:11:08.730
Well, let me see
your fucking gun.

01:11:08.732 --> 01:11:10.698
- You want to see it, big man.
- Yeah, come on.

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.400
Oh my God!
Where did you get that?

01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:13.968
Don't worry about it.

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:17.338
- Oh my God! Oh my God!

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:19.641
- No gun.
- Are you okay?

01:11:19.643 --> 01:11:21.776
Oh my God! Paul are you okay?

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:23.845
- Paul are you okay?
- Get out of here.

01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:27.048
- You're gonna hear from
my lawyers you fuck.

01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:30.051
And you're fired.

01:11:30.053 --> 01:11:34.622
- Wait, Bryan, wait.
Don't leave me just try
and understand.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:38.359
- Don't go.
- Oh my God!
Paul are you okay?

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:42.030
- You should go.
- I'm so sorry.

01:11:42.032 --> 01:11:44.098
It's fine.
It's my fault too. Just...

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:48.136
- Get, get out of here.
- Please leave. Now.

01:11:49.572 --> 01:11:52.407
I'm, again I'm sorry.

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:55.777
- We are fucking done.
- Come on, Katie.

01:11:55.779 --> 01:11:59.113
No, you just lost me
the best job of my life

01:11:59.115 --> 01:12:00.915
and you're fucking
cheating on me.

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:02.817
I am not cheating on you. Okay.

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:05.720
I coach that girls
fucking improve group
and it was only a kiss.

01:12:05.722 --> 01:12:09.290
- Only a kiss?
- Yes, which is a lot less than
what I fucking walked in on.

01:12:09.292 --> 01:12:12.660
- She was not certainly
dressed like a dominatrix.
- We were fucking rehearsing.

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:15.863
That is bull shit.

01:12:18.101 --> 01:12:20.968
- Fuck!
- Oh my God! Oh my God!

01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:23.871
- I took out all the bullets.
- Obviously not
you fucking idiot.

01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:25.406
Loafie.

01:13:49.292 --> 01:13:51.492
Look.

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:55.496
This is not all your fault.

01:13:55.498 --> 01:13:58.599
I shouldn't have done
all that stuff with Bryan.

01:13:58.601 --> 01:13:59.967
Felt like I should...

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:01.702
I don't know, anyway.

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:07.375
I'm sorry, I'm sorry about that.

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:15.869
But I still think
we should take a break.

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:21.389
I mean, you pulled a gun
on someone, Paul.

01:14:21.391 --> 01:14:24.125
- I didn't think it had bullets.
- Still!

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:28.996
For you to do that or whatever.

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:32.633
- Who was that chick?
- I don't even like her.

01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:35.369
It doesn't matter
at this point honestly.

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:41.709
Katie, please.

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:52.353
I'm sorry. It's over.
It really is.

01:14:55.224 --> 01:15:01.829
Uh... You can, uh... pick up
your stuff or whatever,
when ever, but...

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:05.833
Just...

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:08.503
I just want to be
alone right now.

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:33.227
Oh... Are you good?
You look like shit.

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:36.964
- I need your help.
- All right.

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:54.328
Sir, are you expecting
a package?

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:59.453
- No, Dennis.
- Sorry, sir.

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:05.560
<i>Actually, Dennis.</i>

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:08.442
<i>I think that may be</i>
<i>my sterling silver</i>
<i>director's chair.</i>

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:12.700
Okay, sir.

01:16:12.702 --> 01:16:14.569
Gates are opening.

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:20.474
We... Well... Hey...
Uh... Got a delivery.

01:16:20.476 --> 01:16:24.312
- Okay, I'll sign for it.
- Uh... No, you don't have to.

01:16:24.314 --> 01:16:28.749
Uh... I'll just bring it in.
I got to bring it in.
It's the shippers request.

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:49.604
All right.

01:16:49.606 --> 01:16:52.239
Excellent. Thank you, sir.

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:55.610
You're welcome,
Bryan J. Macy.

01:16:58.981 --> 01:17:02.850
- You need me
to sign for that or...
- Nope. We're good.

01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:06.988
No signature required.

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:11.258
- Fantastic. Dennis, can
you show him the door.
- Yeah, sure.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:13.260
- Let's go ahead and head out.
- No, I got to be here.

01:17:13.262 --> 01:17:15.997
- No you don't.
- No, I gotta, I gotta, be here.

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:20.501
What?

01:17:24.674 --> 01:17:26.941
- Damn it, damn it.
- Fine, fine, fine.

01:17:26.943 --> 01:17:29.477
I know this is crazy
that I'm breaking into
your house. I just...

01:17:29.479 --> 01:17:31.612
I need to talk to you
for one second, please.

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.752
First of all,
I want to apologize.

01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:42.923
It was idiotic and dangerous for
me to pull out that gun.
I shouldn't have done that,

01:17:42.925 --> 01:17:44.725
and I hope that you
can accept my apology.

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:51.198
- Fine.
- Great. Thank you.
Thank you.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.969
Besides that,
I'm here to ask you

01:17:56.104 --> 01:18:00.341
beg you, to reconsider
and give Katie the job back.

01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:04.245
She doesn't deserve to be
punished just because she
has a crazy jealous boy friend.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.348
Or had.

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:12.286
She broke up with me,
but I owe it to her

01:18:12.288 --> 01:18:17.491
to at least try to
right my wrongs.
Please.

01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:22.730
Please, let Katie
play this role.

01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:34.041
No.

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:35.843
What's done is done.

01:18:35.845 --> 01:18:38.746
- Dennis, get these ass holes
out of my house please.
- Okay, come on.

01:18:38.748 --> 01:18:40.748
- Wait, Mr. Macy.
- No, I'm done here.

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:43.150
But this is just like
the "Master Maiden".

01:18:45.688 --> 01:18:47.088
Exactly.

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:55.329
This is just like chapter 5.
When uh... Charlie almost
banishes Lucy from

01:18:55.331 --> 01:19:00.000
his manor in Canterbury,
after he's threatened by
Sir Lyons of Nottingham Shire.

01:19:00.002 --> 01:19:03.404
Okay, Sir Lyons and Lucy were
arranged to be married, right,

01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:05.339
but then her father
suddenly dies,

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:08.142
and the pre-arrangement
became void.

01:19:08.144 --> 01:19:10.344
Which is great,
because by that point,

01:19:10.346 --> 01:19:12.980
Lucy's totally
in love with Charlie.

01:19:12.982 --> 01:19:15.082
And then Sir Lyons,
think Paul.

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:18.986
Is a jealous,
petty man

01:19:18.988 --> 01:19:21.856
who can't get over Lucy.
Right?

01:19:21.858 --> 01:19:25.893
So when Sir Lyons walks in
on Lucy and Charlie

01:19:25.895 --> 01:19:29.363
as Charlie is punishing her
because she over boiled
the sheep's pudding

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:31.365
and he draws his sword.

01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:34.235
Yeah Charlie banished her
at first.

01:19:34.237 --> 01:19:37.905
But then he realized
that it was Sir Lyons' fault
the whole time.

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:42.009
And again think Paul
when I say Sir Lyons,

01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:44.945
'cause he's whinny
and he's insecure

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:49.216
and no impulse control.
Right?

01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:51.298
But that doesn't mean
that Lucy should be banished.

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.054
Katie.

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:58.092
I think.

01:19:58.094 --> 01:20:00.254
I think you should let
Katie back in the manor.

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:02.797
You need to get your Lucy back.

01:20:22.784 --> 01:20:25.019
I got your job back.

01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:28.455
- What?
- I went to Bryan's
and I begged him for it.

01:20:28.457 --> 01:20:31.258
It's a long story.
Jim was involved.

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:33.194
- But, yeah.
- Oh my god!

01:20:33.196 --> 01:20:36.363
I went to Bryan's
and convinced him and he
gave you the job back.

01:20:36.365 --> 01:20:38.432
Paul!
Thank you!

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:40.100
Thank God!

01:20:41.436 --> 01:20:43.337
That's so exciting.

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:46.941
Oh, thank you!

01:20:46.943 --> 01:20:48.409
Oh! Um...

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:51.745
- What?
- Um...

01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:56.116
I'm sorry.

01:20:56.952 --> 01:20:58.452
I just...

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:01.789
I'm so grateful
that you got my job back,

01:21:01.791 --> 01:21:04.391
but I, I still think
that we need a break.

01:21:04.393 --> 01:21:06.260
No. Don't... What?

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:11.265
We just...

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:16.804
We've just been
at each other
for so long.

01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:20.774
And, and...

01:21:21.743 --> 01:21:25.346
This whole situation
was awful, but no.

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:29.984
In a way, I'm glad
it all went down
this way.

01:21:29.986 --> 01:21:33.020
They past 24 hours
has brought
so much stuff to light.

01:21:33.022 --> 01:21:34.889
Especially with me
being in England.

01:21:34.891 --> 01:21:37.925
I just...
I don't know how
we're gonna fix it.

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:58.670
I know everything's
not better just because
I got your job back.

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:03.183
The truth is
I never really loved you.

01:22:06.288 --> 01:22:09.456
I thought I did.
And I said I did.

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:14.962
But I've been so angry
and jealous

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:18.966
and insecure,

01:22:18.968 --> 01:22:21.488
there's no way that
I really could have.

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:25.806
So I'm sorry.

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:28.609
I'm very sorry

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:31.845
that I didn't love you

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:36.951
the way that you deserve
to be loved.

01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:44.024
It's okay.

01:22:49.831 --> 01:22:52.533
Can I hang out
until you leave?

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:55.936
Of course.

01:22:57.205 --> 01:22:58.472
Cool. Thanks.

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:02.943
You wanna help me pack?

01:23:02.945 --> 01:23:06.947
Well, I mean,
that's usually an ordeal

01:23:07.682 --> 01:23:09.783
with you.

01:23:09.785 --> 01:23:12.686
But, yeah.
I would love to do that.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:47.474
Katie, what're
you doing?

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:49.109
I'm sorry.

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:51.311
What are you doing?

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:54.181
I'm not going anywhere.
I just called Bryan,
I quit.

01:25:54.183 --> 01:25:56.717
- Why?
- It just wasn't
right for me.

01:25:57.452 --> 01:25:59.820
Look, you were right

01:25:59.822 --> 01:26:02.990
when you said that
you didn't love me
the way that I deserved
to be loved.

01:26:02.992 --> 01:26:06.493
But I didn't love you
the right way either.

01:26:07.328 --> 01:26:10.230
But we should.
Because we deserve it.

01:26:11.132 --> 01:26:13.800
- So let's do that.
- Okay.

01:26:13.802 --> 01:26:17.171
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:26:32.787 --> 01:26:34.454
We need to get jobs.

01:26:46.168 --> 01:26:47.668
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:51.638
I'm gonna get a coffee.
You want something?

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:53.407
No, I'm good.
